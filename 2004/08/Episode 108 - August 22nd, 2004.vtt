WEBVTT

00:00.185 --> 00:01.406
[SPEAKER_07]: That was quite interesting.

00:02.607 --> 00:04.768
[SPEAKER_07]: So, now I guess I really am a geek.

00:05.789 --> 00:06.249
[SPEAKER_35]: Right.

00:06.649 --> 00:07.470
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, anyway.

00:08.411 --> 00:08.891
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, next.

00:09.471 --> 00:10.972
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright, Vandalus, how was your week, how was your day?

00:11.653 --> 00:12.934
[SPEAKER_03]: My week and day were fine.

00:13.794 --> 00:16.256
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I went to work and I did family stuff.

00:17.297 --> 00:19.178
[SPEAKER_03]: So, pretty standard stuff for me.

00:19.958 --> 00:20.279
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright.

00:20.799 --> 00:23.401
[SPEAKER_35]: Rice Princess, how was your week, how was your day?

00:24.561 --> 00:25.122
[SPEAKER_08]: How was my day?

00:25.482 --> 00:26.343
[SPEAKER_35]: How was your week, how was your day?

00:26.663 --> 00:28.264
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, um, blah.

00:29.785 --> 00:30.366
[SPEAKER_35]: Just blah?

00:31.066 --> 00:31.407
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright.

00:32.027 --> 00:33.008
[SPEAKER_35]: Is that all you want to share?

00:33.128 --> 00:33.308
[SPEAKER_35]: Yeah.

00:33.628 --> 00:34.049
[SPEAKER_35]: Okay then.

00:34.829 --> 00:35.730
[SPEAKER_35]: Sigurd, how was your week?

00:35.750 --> 00:36.170
[SPEAKER_35]: How was your day?

00:36.631 --> 00:37.852
[SPEAKER_28]: My week was boring.

00:38.913 --> 00:45.298
[SPEAKER_28]: But today was funny because I went to go get an iPod and I had the worst customer service in the history of customer service.

00:45.778 --> 00:53.104
[SPEAKER_28]: When I went to pay for it, the lady at the checkout was basically demanding that I get the service plan because she was saying it was a piece of crap.

00:53.685 --> 00:57.227
[SPEAKER_28]: And I swear, if she would have had a knife, she would have held it to my throat until I got it.

00:57.888 --> 00:59.069
[SPEAKER_28]: Then we went to Radio Shack

00:59.831 --> 01:08.174
[SPEAKER_28]: and I asked if they had any accessories like a holder or something and they started saying it was a piece of crap thing and Apple's only good for one item.

01:08.654 --> 01:09.835
[SPEAKER_28]: So I hope they all die.

01:11.515 --> 01:11.895
[SPEAKER_28]: The end.

01:12.096 --> 01:12.616
[SPEAKER_35]: Very nice.

01:13.076 --> 01:13.356
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright.

01:17.461 --> 01:22.743
[SPEAKER_35]: All right, then there was my week and my day, and my week was pretty uninteresting.

01:23.163 --> 01:25.143
[SPEAKER_35]: The Classic Gaming Expo, I guess, was my highlight.

01:25.163 --> 01:28.625
[SPEAKER_35]: You know, I've just been hanging out with people throughout the week, that's all.

01:29.245 --> 01:30.025
[SPEAKER_35]: Nothing too exciting.

01:31.005 --> 01:33.666
[SPEAKER_35]: All right, I guess at this time we're going to go ahead and go to a break.

01:35.287 --> 01:35.827
[SPEAKER_09]: Breaks are good.

01:36.027 --> 01:36.707
[SPEAKER_35]: Yeah, breaks are good.

01:37.167 --> 01:41.369
[SPEAKER_35]: So we're going to go to a break, and then we'll come back and we'll talk to Sigurd a little more about Ultramix stuff.

01:42.689 --> 01:43.069
[SPEAKER_35]: Sound good?

01:43.429 --> 01:43.849
[SPEAKER_35]: Sounds good.

01:43.989 --> 01:45.670
[SPEAKER_35]: All right, we'll be back after this.

03:08.641 --> 03:12.524
[SPEAKER_35]: So, Sigurd, I heard you brought a sound clip with you tonight that you wanted us all to hear.

03:13.484 --> 03:13.784
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

03:14.145 --> 03:14.865
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, okay.

03:14.885 --> 03:15.606
[SPEAKER_28]: So you should play it.

03:15.966 --> 03:17.307
[SPEAKER_35]: I will play that for everybody.

03:17.647 --> 03:18.428
[SPEAKER_38]: Is it a hint?

03:19.488 --> 03:20.549
[SPEAKER_38]: I think it might be.

03:22.630 --> 03:24.211
[SPEAKER_38]: Mama don't like tattletales.

03:24.231 --> 03:26.633
[SPEAKER_35]: That was interesting.

03:26.773 --> 03:27.253
[SPEAKER_38]: Good luck.

03:27.614 --> 03:27.934
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

05:16.147 --> 05:17.729
[SPEAKER_38]: Mama don't like tattletales.

05:44.577 --> 05:45.558
[SPEAKER_05]: Why isn't the movie on?

05:45.638 --> 05:46.398
[SPEAKER_05]: You are the star!

05:46.518 --> 05:48.980
[SPEAKER_19]: Why isn't the movie on?

05:49.040 --> 05:49.460
You are the star!

06:16.758 --> 06:17.419
Thanks for watching!

06:54.737 --> 06:55.997
[SPEAKER_35]: Orange Lounge Radio.

06:56.317 --> 06:58.478
[SPEAKER_35]: We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.

07:04.893 --> 07:05.474
[SPEAKER_35]: All right, guys.

07:05.514 --> 07:09.759
[SPEAKER_35]: During the break, you received the first of the clues tonight, and this is the way it's going to work.

07:09.860 --> 07:18.891
[SPEAKER_35]: When we open it up, and only when we say you can guess the song, send me a private message in the chat room when we say to, and you'll have an opportunity to guess the song.

07:19.051 --> 07:20.994
[SPEAKER_35]: If you are the first person to get it right...

07:21.874 --> 07:33.299
[SPEAKER_35]: If you are one of our Skype users, meaning if you go to our website www.orangesongeradio.com and click on interact with us, if you're right, you can be the one to announce it to everybody on the air what the song is.

07:33.719 --> 07:38.261
[SPEAKER_35]: If you don't have Skype though, you can just tell in the chat room and then we'll relay the message for you.

07:38.521 --> 07:48.365
[SPEAKER_35]: But again, only at certain times will you be able to submit a guess to me in the chat room and there'll be more clues to come if that one didn't quite do it for you.

07:48.825 --> 07:50.386
[SPEAKER_35]: Mama don't like tattletales.

07:50.826 --> 07:54.333
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright, anyway, so... Yeah, that just didn't do it for me at all.

07:55.034 --> 07:57.238
[SPEAKER_35]: It probably didn't do it for a lot of people, but it's not supposed to be easy.

07:57.719 --> 07:58.019
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright.

07:59.422 --> 08:00.664
[SPEAKER_35]: So, Seeker, thank you for bringing the clip.

08:00.684 --> 08:01.345
[SPEAKER_35]: I appreciate that.

08:07.150 --> 08:07.590
[SPEAKER_28]: You're welcome.

08:08.651 --> 08:12.373
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm avoiding various cups, just trying to get the microphone over here.

08:12.393 --> 08:14.695
[SPEAKER_35]: That's alright, there's just a lot of people here denying a lot of stuff here.

08:14.775 --> 08:15.275
[SPEAKER_35]: And porn.

08:17.056 --> 08:20.839
[SPEAKER_35]: So, anything exciting going on at Konami you want to share with the rest of us?

08:21.059 --> 08:22.140
[SPEAKER_35]: I'll just jump right into it.

08:22.200 --> 08:27.483
[SPEAKER_28]: There's always exciting stuff going on at Konami, whether I can share it or not.

08:28.484 --> 08:31.666
[SPEAKER_28]: Actually, there's an interesting thing I can talk about.

08:32.493 --> 08:36.094
[SPEAKER_28]: Everybody who knows about the game Rumble Roses.

08:37.394 --> 08:40.075
[SPEAKER_28]: It's actually a pretty good game, just so you know.

08:40.115 --> 08:42.175
[SPEAKER_28]: It's not all boobs.

08:42.215 --> 08:45.716
[SPEAKER_28]: It is all boobs, but it's actually fun to play.

08:48.676 --> 08:53.738
[SPEAKER_28]: The interesting thing about it is that it has the Imani artists doing the music.

08:55.238 --> 09:00.499
[SPEAKER_28]: You have Akira Yamaoka, which you can stop right there because that makes it worth a purchase already.

09:01.489 --> 09:14.611
[SPEAKER_28]: Um, it's got, uh, U1, it's got Desro, it has Taka, it has, um, the person that does JetWorld, I don't remember the name off the top of my head, what?

09:17.372 --> 09:20.792
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm sorry, I just, uh, killed one of the cups all over Angel.

09:21.312 --> 09:21.753
[SPEAKER_29]: How you doing?

09:23.433 --> 09:27.734
[SPEAKER_29]: Is that, is that water, or is that... Oh yeah, Loki says watch the cups, thanks!

09:29.594 --> 09:29.854
[SPEAKER_29]: So...

09:31.345 --> 09:43.696
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes, what I was going to say was, yeah, and it's got an awesome cover of Yankee Rose, the song that, who is it, David Lee Roth did, that they used in that old E3 trailer or whatever.

09:44.356 --> 09:44.917
[SPEAKER_29]: That's pretty cool.

09:46.038 --> 09:47.679
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, that actually is a really good song.

09:48.860 --> 09:51.663
[SPEAKER_28]: But yeah, that's the really cool thing about Rumble Roses.

09:52.563 --> 09:57.187
[SPEAKER_28]: Don't know why they're in there, but thank goodness they are, because that means I'm going to buy it now.

09:58.849 --> 09:59.149
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

10:02.785 --> 10:07.388
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, okay, yeah, the songs, for the most part, there is one repeated song.

10:07.868 --> 10:11.930
[SPEAKER_28]: You can actually hear it on videos that play in GameStop and EB Games.

10:11.991 --> 10:13.071
[SPEAKER_28]: You'll hear Look to the Sky.

10:13.511 --> 10:14.072
[SPEAKER_28]: That's in it.

10:15.673 --> 10:19.135
[SPEAKER_28]: Also, I think that's the only repeated song.

10:19.155 --> 10:20.235
[SPEAKER_28]: The rest of them are brand new.

10:20.816 --> 10:21.356
[SPEAKER_35]: Very cool.

10:21.396 --> 10:22.717
[SPEAKER_28]: They are very, very good.

10:22.757 --> 10:25.178
[SPEAKER_28]: Like, me personally, I don't like DJ Taka.

10:26.319 --> 10:27.760
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, um...

10:28.661 --> 10:30.522
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't like his music.

10:32.043 --> 10:33.824
[SPEAKER_28]: But this song is so good.

10:35.485 --> 10:37.966
[SPEAKER_28]: So yeah, look forward to that.

10:40.508 --> 10:45.231
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright, so definitely Bomani fans are going to have to suffer through this TNA game.

10:45.331 --> 10:47.072
[SPEAKER_28]: Don't suffer, it's actually fun.

10:47.092 --> 10:49.173
[SPEAKER_35]: That's coming from me.

10:49.213 --> 10:49.933
[SPEAKER_35]: I'll take your word for it.

10:50.374 --> 10:53.535
[SPEAKER_29]: Rob, just because you're gay doesn't mean that everybody else is going to suffer.

10:53.816 --> 10:54.496
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright, shut up.

10:54.516 --> 10:55.537
[SPEAKER_29]: You might be the only one.

10:55.817 --> 10:56.277
[SPEAKER_35]: I'll be quiet.

10:58.638 --> 11:00.802
[SPEAKER_35]: All right, so how's Ultramix 2 looking?

11:01.102 --> 11:04.147
[SPEAKER_35]: Is it starting to get a little bit finalized there or ready to roll?

11:04.167 --> 11:05.629
[SPEAKER_28]: Ultramix 2 is looking awesome.

11:05.730 --> 11:07.132
[SPEAKER_28]: Very nice.

11:07.152 --> 11:08.113
[SPEAKER_28]: It's very, very cool.

11:10.818 --> 11:12.721
[SPEAKER_28]: This was said earlier in the chat room, I think.

11:14.065 --> 11:29.119
[SPEAKER_28]: You know, we give hints out on DDR Freak, and one of our hints to my absolute favorite song on that game, Skulk, Cutress picked it up and linked everybody to an MP3 that was not quite correct.

11:29.179 --> 11:31.341
[SPEAKER_28]: It was like a remix of the song.

11:31.841 --> 11:37.926
[SPEAKER_28]: We actually have the original version of the song in the game, so all you trance fans and all that...

11:38.908 --> 11:40.109
[SPEAKER_28]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

11:59.799 --> 12:01.260
[SPEAKER_35]: Oh, tell us about the cookie thing.

12:01.320 --> 12:02.341
[SPEAKER_28]: I want to talk about the cookie thing.

12:02.361 --> 12:03.001
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll do that now.

12:04.202 --> 12:09.384
[SPEAKER_28]: So, we have a member on the DDR Freak Board that goes by the name El Mollet.

12:09.805 --> 12:10.565
[SPEAKER_28]: Hi, El Mollet.

12:12.526 --> 12:15.288
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, I know it's a great name, isn't it?

12:15.668 --> 12:16.468
[SPEAKER_35]: It's a wonderful name.

12:16.889 --> 12:21.631
[SPEAKER_28]: And, you know, we're giving our clues out, and I think the clue that we gave was for, like, Night in Motion.

12:22.071 --> 12:24.773
[SPEAKER_28]: You know, everybody comments on the...

12:27.190 --> 12:32.414
[SPEAKER_28]: When we announced the song, he was like, oh, yay, or wow, that's crap, or I'm too indecisive.

12:33.134 --> 12:44.142
[SPEAKER_28]: And El Mollet said something I don't remember, but then his reply was like, yeah, now you guys just need to announce Moonlight Shadow and I'll be happy, or something like that.

12:44.742 --> 12:52.548
[SPEAKER_28]: And so, since I know the track listing, and I'm part of the people that are giving out hints, I was like, okay, the next hint I'm going to give out is Moonlight Shadow.

12:53.191 --> 12:53.651
[SPEAKER_28]: So I did.

12:54.432 --> 12:56.913
[SPEAKER_28]: And he like promised cookies if it was in the game.

12:57.153 --> 13:05.137
[SPEAKER_28]: So, you know, we went and said Moonlight Shadow's in the game and I PM'd him the Konami's address.

13:05.957 --> 13:07.538
[SPEAKER_28]: And so he sent cookies.

13:09.719 --> 13:12.480
[SPEAKER_35]: Somebody actually followed through on that and he actually sent cookies.

13:12.720 --> 13:13.380
[SPEAKER_35]: What kind of cookies?

13:14.661 --> 13:15.942
[SPEAKER_28]: Chewy chocolate chips ahoy.

13:16.282 --> 13:16.822
[SPEAKER_35]: Oh, yummy.

13:19.705 --> 13:22.807
[SPEAKER_28]: It was so unexpected.

13:23.188 --> 13:27.031
[SPEAKER_28]: Me and Floatwalk were just kidding around about it.

13:27.531 --> 13:29.593
[SPEAKER_28]: The fact that he went through and did that was so awesome.

13:29.733 --> 13:32.515
[SPEAKER_28]: He also wrote a really nice letter.

13:32.555 --> 13:33.436
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, I want to read the letter.

13:34.076 --> 13:37.519
[SPEAKER_28]: It's going to be read on the radio.

13:38.179 --> 13:41.342
[SPEAKER_35]: Actually, I can't read the whole thing because it's like two pages.

13:41.522 --> 13:42.183
[SPEAKER_35]: It's a long letter.

13:42.763 --> 13:43.444
[SPEAKER_35]: It's a love letter.

13:43.464 --> 13:44.725
[SPEAKER_35]: It says, Sigurd, I love you.

13:44.765 --> 13:45.705
[SPEAKER_35]: I want to have your baby.

13:45.825 --> 13:46.306
[SPEAKER_35]: Oh, I'm sorry.

13:46.946 --> 13:47.727
[SPEAKER_35]: That was a different letter.

13:48.208 --> 13:49.649
[SPEAKER_35]: How was the letter LankyStyle was writing?

13:49.689 --> 13:50.010
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm sorry.

13:50.390 --> 13:54.613
[SPEAKER_29]: The part that scared me was the part where, like, on the second page there's blood splattered on it.

13:54.674 --> 13:56.315
[SPEAKER_29]: I was kind of like, uh, whoa.

13:57.576 --> 14:08.205
[SPEAKER_28]: I need to, um, Terai-chan, uh, not homemade, we requested chewy chocolate chips ahoy because we had gone through our entire bag the first day we got it from the store, so we wanted more.

14:08.858 --> 14:14.902
[SPEAKER_35]: And to point out, by the way, if you want to interact with our chat room, head on over to our website, www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on chat.

14:15.182 --> 14:18.284
[SPEAKER_35]: And that's how you can also participate in tonight's clue guessing game.

14:18.805 --> 14:21.046
[SPEAKER_35]: And you'll have your first opportunity to submit a guess.

14:21.447 --> 14:26.810
[SPEAKER_35]: Maybe you're doing a little research on that last sound clip, or maybe there's really nothing to research at all, and we're just really fucking with you.

14:26.990 --> 14:27.631
[SPEAKER_35]: I don't know.

14:28.131 --> 14:29.192
[SPEAKER_35]: We will soon find out.

14:29.992 --> 14:32.134
[SPEAKER_35]: But if you have a guess, you'll have your first chance to submit it in a little bit.

14:32.154 --> 14:33.394
[SPEAKER_35]: But first, I want to talk about the letter.

14:34.375 --> 14:34.937
[SPEAKER_35]: Let's do the letter.

14:34.997 --> 14:35.840
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, let's do the letter.

14:35.860 --> 14:37.886
[SPEAKER_35]: I have to find some letter-reading music, though.

14:37.926 --> 14:40.935
[SPEAKER_28]: Play Moonlight Shadow, because it's symbolic or something.

14:43.823 --> 14:46.666
[SPEAKER_35]: to all those involved with DDR Ultramix 2.

14:48.227 --> 14:50.069
[SPEAKER_35]: As promised, here are the cookies.

14:50.890 --> 14:55.295
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm a man of my word, and I never expected such a marvelous development to happen.

14:55.835 --> 14:59.699
[SPEAKER_35]: I mean, Moonlight Shadow is my favorite license of all time.

15:00.139 --> 15:02.682
[SPEAKER_35]: And somehow, you guys managed to obtain it.

15:03.182 --> 15:05.425
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm impressed, and I am very thankful.

15:07.054 --> 15:08.697
[SPEAKER_35]: I need to thank you, all of you.

15:09.117 --> 15:15.687
[SPEAKER_35]: With your input and your new ideas, you will be adding an incredible breath of fresh air to a slowly stagnating series.

15:20.930 --> 15:24.813
[SPEAKER_35]: Without the Xbox side of DDR, I'm not sure if I would be playing the game still.

15:25.214 --> 15:32.519
[SPEAKER_35]: Sure, the non-stop Anony modes from the arcade and PS2 mixes are fun, but over the past couple of years, these modes have slowly been growing old on their own.

15:33.020 --> 15:38.144
[SPEAKER_35]: With the new innovations the new American DDR games are receiving, the series would have become stale by now.

15:38.784 --> 15:42.645
[SPEAKER_35]: Sure, you can add song after song after song on a mix, but there is more to a mix than that.

15:43.986 --> 15:46.027
[SPEAKER_35]: And so, I offer you these cookies.

15:46.587 --> 15:51.969
[SPEAKER_35]: Not only for adding my favorite Japanese DDR song onto a US mix, but as a token of my appreciation.

15:52.709 --> 16:00.311
[SPEAKER_35]: From the game descriptions thus far, you have gone above and beyond the call of duty for creating a new DDR game, and not simply a rehashed version of a Japanese game.

16:00.812 --> 16:04.013
[SPEAKER_35]: I never thought I would become this excited over an Xbox DDR title.

16:05.133 --> 16:08.994
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you for going in a different direction and not sticking with the traditional formula.

16:10.075 --> 16:14.776
[SPEAKER_29]: Is this one of those stories where, like, at the end, like, the paraplegic kid starts to walk or something?

16:14.916 --> 16:15.436
[SPEAKER_35]: I think so.

16:15.456 --> 16:16.457
[SPEAKER_35]: Here's the last paragraph.

16:16.677 --> 16:19.517
[SPEAKER_35]: You've earned my money, you've earned my respect, and you've earned these cookies.

16:19.978 --> 16:23.039
[SPEAKER_35]: Take care in your future endeavors, and I wish all goes well for the release of the current mix.

16:23.339 --> 16:26.400
[SPEAKER_35]: A fan, a player, and a grateful person, El Mollet.

16:27.160 --> 16:28.500
[SPEAKER_35]: Now, see, wasn't that awesome?

16:28.940 --> 16:33.182
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm very sad to say that the song got cut at the last minute, so there's no more Moonlight Shadow.

16:36.363 --> 16:38.564
[SPEAKER_05]: That's great.

16:38.644 --> 16:41.146
[SPEAKER_28]: We got cookies, so we can really cut that song now.

16:41.166 --> 16:42.347
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll cut like three others.

16:43.607 --> 16:45.008
[SPEAKER_29]: You shouldn't have said just kidding.

16:45.068 --> 16:47.790
[SPEAKER_29]: Because then you would have got another letter without cookies.

16:48.010 --> 16:49.290
[SPEAKER_29]: Or cookies with laxative in them.

16:49.791 --> 16:52.712
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, did you notice y'all had to go to the bathroom after that?

16:52.813 --> 16:56.715
[SPEAKER_28]: One of our team members did not want to eat the cookies because he thought they were poisonous.

16:56.895 --> 16:59.116
[SPEAKER_28]: And we're like, so you'll die by cookie.

16:59.216 --> 17:00.877
[SPEAKER_28]: That's like a bad thing or something.

17:02.038 --> 17:02.278
[SPEAKER_28]: But...

17:02.819 --> 17:15.926
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, I mean, it just goes to show you that if you're nice, cough, Extreme US, bored, cough, cough, this is directed at you, you might get some good stuff in return.

17:16.026 --> 17:17.667
[SPEAKER_35]: So, I was going to ask you about this.

17:18.087 --> 17:19.968
[SPEAKER_35]: I was going to corny and just ask you about this while I have you here.

17:19.988 --> 17:22.270
[SPEAKER_35]: Why the hell aren't you posting anything in the Extreme US thread?

17:22.350 --> 17:23.370
[SPEAKER_28]: Give us a clear answer.

17:23.410 --> 17:24.791
[SPEAKER_28]: Have you read the US Extreme thread?

17:24.811 --> 17:25.191
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, I have.

17:26.012 --> 17:27.012
[SPEAKER_28]: I just want to hear it from you.

17:27.172 --> 17:29.754
[SPEAKER_35]: I know why I wouldn't be posting there, but I want to hear it from you.

17:30.854 --> 17:32.115
[SPEAKER_28]: The Extreme US thread...

17:32.924 --> 17:41.568
[SPEAKER_28]: is very, to put it in a nice way, is very annoying and stupid.

17:42.569 --> 17:46.191
[SPEAKER_28]: But, and Elle Mullet's signature sums it up the best.

17:46.531 --> 17:48.472
[SPEAKER_28]: This is what goes on the thread there.

17:49.152 --> 17:52.074
[SPEAKER_28]: Dang it, we want our American mixes to be more Japanese.

17:53.114 --> 17:54.055
[SPEAKER_28]: And it's just like,

17:55.167 --> 17:57.108
[SPEAKER_28]: If you want the Japanese games, get the Japanese ones.

17:57.148 --> 18:01.231
[SPEAKER_28]: If you want the American games, to be Japanese... But I can't afford it!

18:01.291 --> 18:02.632
[SPEAKER_19]: It's too expensive!

18:02.652 --> 18:03.992
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, then go play it in the arcade.

18:04.032 --> 18:06.054
[SPEAKER_28]: If you want it at home, do something else.

18:06.214 --> 18:10.536
[SPEAKER_28]: But quit whining that your mix is not exactly like the Japanese one.

18:10.576 --> 18:11.457
[SPEAKER_28]: It never will be.

18:12.798 --> 18:13.218
[SPEAKER_28]: And so...

18:14.218 --> 18:16.619
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, we have some people we don't like on there.

18:17.059 --> 18:19.981
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, don't hold back now.

18:20.041 --> 18:22.282
[SPEAKER_28]: They think they know what they're talking about.

18:22.722 --> 18:26.164
[SPEAKER_28]: Why so-and-so isn't in this version and why this looks like this.

18:26.664 --> 18:27.645
[SPEAKER_28]: They don't know anything.

18:28.205 --> 18:32.627
[SPEAKER_28]: So we get a good laugh out of the extreme thread, but that's about it.

18:33.349 --> 18:34.950
[SPEAKER_28]: That's all that thread's good for now.

18:35.270 --> 18:37.650
[SPEAKER_35]: Well, plus, you have the song list for Xtreme, right?

18:37.670 --> 18:39.011
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, I've played Xtreme.

18:39.371 --> 18:40.531
[SPEAKER_28]: I know all the unlocks.

18:40.571 --> 18:41.452
[SPEAKER_28]: I know all the courses.

18:41.472 --> 18:43.112
[SPEAKER_35]: And the unlocks are going to stay unlocks, right?

18:43.272 --> 18:44.412
[SPEAKER_28]: The unlocks are staying unlocks.

18:44.473 --> 18:45.213
[SPEAKER_28]: Xtreme is done.

18:45.533 --> 18:45.873
[SPEAKER_35]: Okay.

18:45.893 --> 18:46.313
[SPEAKER_28]: Pretty much.

18:46.453 --> 18:47.974
[SPEAKER_28]: I mean, it comes out the end of September.

18:48.354 --> 18:49.234
[SPEAKER_35]: You guys can wait.

18:49.574 --> 18:50.234
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, I know.

18:50.294 --> 18:54.816
[SPEAKER_28]: It's like, poor Ultramix people, they don't even know their initial song list yet.

18:55.136 --> 18:56.896
[SPEAKER_28]: And that only comes out a couple months after.

18:58.497 --> 19:02.238
[SPEAKER_28]: So, we're paying attention to them because, you know, they have...

19:02.845 --> 19:06.575
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm guessing around 20 songs announced so far, probably even less than that.

19:07.117 --> 19:08.340
[SPEAKER_28]: And you guys have a whole 45, I think?

19:09.966 --> 19:11.167
[SPEAKER_35]: So this is just catching up.

19:11.307 --> 19:12.908
[SPEAKER_28]: Tonight we'll have 21.

19:12.988 --> 19:14.029
[SPEAKER_28]: Hopefully somebody will get it.

19:14.069 --> 19:14.730
[SPEAKER_28]: Tonight's 21.

19:15.950 --> 19:17.011
[SPEAKER_35]: In fact, you know what, guys?

19:17.311 --> 19:18.192
[SPEAKER_35]: Here's your first chance.

19:18.673 --> 19:21.274
[SPEAKER_35]: For the next three minutes, you can send me a private message.

19:21.314 --> 19:25.037
[SPEAKER_35]: If you have a guess on what the song is, and if you get it right, you get to tell everybody.

19:25.117 --> 19:25.818
[SPEAKER_35]: So here it is.

19:25.878 --> 19:28.180
[SPEAKER_35]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your guess.

19:28.540 --> 19:32.683
[SPEAKER_28]: If you guys honestly get it off that one clue, I might have to send you cookies.

19:36.446 --> 19:39.508
[SPEAKER_29]: And when you say cookies, it's a metaphor for something else, right?

19:46.212 --> 19:50.419
[SPEAKER_35]: Vandalist is our official timekeeper, by the way, and he'll let you guys know in the chatroom when your time is up.

19:50.880 --> 19:51.962
[SPEAKER_35]: So, all right.

19:55.276 --> 20:00.418
[SPEAKER_35]: Okay, so Ultramix 2 and Extreme.

20:00.438 --> 20:02.519
[SPEAKER_35]: Do we have a firm release date for either one yet?

20:02.579 --> 20:03.840
[SPEAKER_35]: I don't know what you can and can't say.

20:03.860 --> 20:05.120
[SPEAKER_28]: No, we don't have a firm release date.

20:05.580 --> 20:06.901
[SPEAKER_35]: We just know September-ish.

20:07.421 --> 20:08.922
[SPEAKER_28]: Extreme might have one.

20:09.102 --> 20:12.063
[SPEAKER_28]: Off the top of my head, I'm not sure what was said in the press release.

20:12.403 --> 20:14.224
[SPEAKER_28]: You have to go by what's said in the press release.

20:14.384 --> 20:16.085
[SPEAKER_28]: I might have a more specific date.

20:16.165 --> 20:16.805
[SPEAKER_28]: I might not.

20:17.966 --> 20:20.927
[SPEAKER_28]: Just look forward to it towards the end of the month.

20:22.439 --> 20:24.280
[SPEAKER_28]: Extreme, or not Extreme, Ultramix.

20:24.821 --> 20:27.764
[SPEAKER_28]: We're shooting for November sometime.

20:29.005 --> 20:31.807
[SPEAKER_28]: So, you know, when you pick up Halo 2, pick up Ultramix 2.

20:32.568 --> 20:34.710
[SPEAKER_28]: Just get the games that have number 2 in them.

20:34.730 --> 20:35.490
[SPEAKER_28]: Just remember that.

20:36.171 --> 20:38.953
[SPEAKER_28]: But more specifically, the one with Ultramix in the title as well.

20:40.375 --> 20:41.396
[SPEAKER_28]: It's a really great game.

20:43.417 --> 20:45.039
[SPEAKER_28]: That's all I really can say about it, I guess.

20:45.582 --> 20:46.323
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright, sounds good.

20:48.124 --> 20:52.407
[SPEAKER_35]: Um... Well, actually, I'm trying to get the Echo Image song, Skulk.

20:52.747 --> 20:53.048
[SPEAKER_35]: Okay.

20:53.108 --> 20:54.989
[SPEAKER_35]: Tell us a little bit about, like, this song.

20:55.049 --> 21:01.374
[SPEAKER_35]: Like, where... I don't know if you can talk about where it comes from or anything, but... I don't know what you can say or what you can't say, but... Let me... Okay.

21:02.495 --> 21:08.199
[SPEAKER_28]: Um... Echo Image, the song Skulk, is US exclusive, obviously, not a Konami original.

21:09.119 --> 21:12.482
[SPEAKER_28]: Um... It's... I won't say...

21:14.469 --> 21:15.270
[SPEAKER_28]: Let me think here.

21:15.490 --> 21:17.192
[SPEAKER_28]: You don't have to say anything more if you don't want to.

21:17.212 --> 21:24.198
[SPEAKER_28]: When you play the game, there will be a few songs that you'll notice the background images have URLs in them.

21:24.758 --> 21:25.539
[SPEAKER_28]: This will be one of them.

21:26.260 --> 21:30.743
[SPEAKER_28]: So... Yeah.

21:30.824 --> 21:37.549
[SPEAKER_28]: Just know that it's a really good song, and it's probably my favorite, but as everybody can tell you, I have really bad taste in music.

21:37.830 --> 21:38.150
[SPEAKER_35]: Oh, no.

21:38.670 --> 21:39.451
[SPEAKER_28]: No, seriously.

21:39.471 --> 21:39.551
[SPEAKER_28]: Like...

21:42.202 --> 21:42.843
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, shut up!

21:42.923 --> 21:49.210
[SPEAKER_28]: Kiriyama Oak is the best thing that's ever happened to the... I know, but... I was being joking, too.

21:53.014 --> 21:53.795
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm confused now.

21:53.835 --> 21:54.075
[SPEAKER_28]: Great.

21:55.836 --> 21:59.438
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, so Echo Image, Skulk, awesome.

21:59.678 --> 22:07.523
[SPEAKER_28]: You guys have been led astray by Cutris because the song you guys have been downloading from Amazon, it doesn't sound anything like the actual song, really.

22:07.903 --> 22:08.864
[SPEAKER_35]: But we are going to play the actual song.

22:08.884 --> 22:10.605
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, we're going to have the actual song up here.

22:10.965 --> 22:14.087
[SPEAKER_35]: And actually what I'm going to do, I'm going to leave the microphones on.

22:14.847 --> 22:15.908
[SPEAKER_35]: Now, it's cool you can do this, right?

22:15.928 --> 22:18.209
[SPEAKER_35]: You're going to tell us kind of what portions of the song.

22:18.349 --> 22:18.610
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah.

22:18.670 --> 22:21.211
[SPEAKER_35]: So this is the first time we've really done anything like this.

22:21.231 --> 22:23.853
[SPEAKER_35]: You're going to tell us kind of what portions of the song are actually in the game.

22:24.273 --> 22:24.774
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

22:24.934 --> 22:25.394
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

22:43.648 --> 22:47.110
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm kind of stretching time here because I'm waiting for the three minutes to run out here.

22:47.190 --> 22:48.191
[SPEAKER_35]: Vandalus is keeping time.

22:49.111 --> 22:50.072
[SPEAKER_35]: Let me check the guesses.

22:50.112 --> 22:51.513
[SPEAKER_35]: We've gotten three guesses so far.

22:53.014 --> 22:53.934
[SPEAKER_35]: Nope, that's not it.

22:53.974 --> 22:54.694
[SPEAKER_35]: WhiteRob.

22:56.235 --> 22:57.116
[SPEAKER_35]: That's not it.

22:57.276 --> 22:58.657
[SPEAKER_35]: MJS.

22:58.697 --> 22:59.877
[SPEAKER_28]: And only one guess.

22:59.917 --> 23:00.998
[SPEAKER_28]: Did you already close the windows?

23:01.458 --> 23:03.559
[SPEAKER_28]: You should read what they put so I can laugh.

23:05.772 --> 23:07.774
[SPEAKER_35]: I forgot the one that WhiteRob guessed, sorry.

23:08.595 --> 23:12.319
[SPEAKER_35]: MJSI24, I only take the first guess, you only get one guess a turn.

23:12.639 --> 23:14.060
[SPEAKER_35]: He says, the themed Dick Tracy.

23:14.661 --> 23:14.961
[SPEAKER_31]: What?

23:15.301 --> 23:16.142
[SPEAKER_35]: I have no idea where that comes from.

23:16.543 --> 23:20.807
[SPEAKER_35]: Nigma says, my guess is one something from Elvis or Two Memories.

23:21.565 --> 23:41.692
[SPEAKER_28]: Um, for one thing, that's not specific, so no, and for second thing, oh, okay, I thought number one, I think you meant something from Elvis, but that's not a song name, so I have to throw that guess out, so, you gotta give me song name and title, and we prefer on the board reasoning as well, you can't be like, cause you might be able to get a

23:42.213 --> 23:44.554
[SPEAKER_28]: And lastly, last pick here, Jazz is saying Silent Hill, STFU Mix.

23:44.574 --> 23:45.695
[SPEAKER_28]: Nice guess, but no.

23:45.715 --> 23:49.136
[SPEAKER_35]: Cutress is in our chat room and he's saying he's being schooled by you.

24:03.474 --> 24:05.456
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, there's nothing but love between us cutters.

24:05.476 --> 24:13.583
[SPEAKER_35]: You know, I liked... Honestly, I think the mix that we're going to play here that Sigurd's got, it's not that much different.

24:13.643 --> 24:16.985
[SPEAKER_35]: It's just that the one that was on the site was a little more trancy.

24:17.005 --> 24:17.726
[SPEAKER_35]: But I liked it.

24:17.986 --> 24:19.888
[SPEAKER_35]: Personally, I thought it was a great track.

24:20.168 --> 24:21.049
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't like it.

24:21.109 --> 24:21.969
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't like that mix.

24:23.691 --> 24:27.114
[SPEAKER_28]: I can't fault him for that because he was just going off what he saw.

24:28.535 --> 24:31.697
[SPEAKER_28]: So, you know, I'm not really making fun of him right now.

24:32.058 --> 24:32.338
[SPEAKER_35]: All right.

24:33.820 --> 24:44.662
[SPEAKER_30]: The other thing I'd like to mention, that the whole genre of synth pop, at least my basing it off of this one group, it's pretty much trance mixed with industrial anyway, so, I mean, it's not that far off.

24:44.682 --> 24:45.983
[SPEAKER_30]: It's a little happier, too.

24:46.443 --> 24:53.845
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah, it's like, if you were to take goth music and make it happy, and add trance to it, there you go.

24:56.685 --> 24:57.725
[SPEAKER_35]: Yes, uh, link's down.

24:58.446 --> 24:59.126
[SPEAKER_29]: Is this a new mic?

24:59.506 --> 24:59.666
Yeah.

24:59.746 --> 25:00.226
[SPEAKER_29]: It's pretty nice.

25:00.286 --> 25:00.466
[SPEAKER_29]: Anyway.

25:01.144 --> 25:08.008
[SPEAKER_29]: A little bit of information for you, too, if you didn't know, but all trance and techno and all things derivative are all just disco, so, eh.

25:08.028 --> 25:10.089
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright, you ready to play the song?

25:10.169 --> 25:11.409
[SPEAKER_35]: Actually, wait, one thing I want to point out.

25:11.449 --> 25:12.950
[SPEAKER_35]: Where did you finally find this album?

25:13.170 --> 25:19.473
[SPEAKER_28]: I finally found it after a long time of searching at A. Rasputin Records in San Francisco.

25:19.713 --> 25:21.134
[SPEAKER_28]: I had been searching the whole Bay Area.

25:21.154 --> 25:26.637
[SPEAKER_28]: I went to all the little shops I could find, and then I lucked out, and they had one copy.

25:27.288 --> 25:28.188
[SPEAKER_28]: and they held it for me.

25:29.649 --> 25:30.169
[SPEAKER_35]: Where was it?

25:30.809 --> 25:31.869
[SPEAKER_28]: In the goth section.

25:31.969 --> 25:33.309
[SPEAKER_35]: In the goth section.

25:34.190 --> 25:36.050
[SPEAKER_28]: So the music you're about to hear is goth.

25:36.330 --> 25:37.290
[SPEAKER_28]: Technically, yeah.

25:37.430 --> 25:42.451
[SPEAKER_28]: If you trust Rasputin's titling of their music, it's goth.

25:43.692 --> 25:44.012
[SPEAKER_35]: Here we go.

25:44.072 --> 25:48.373
[SPEAKER_35]: Here's a song and I'm going to leave the microphones on so the microphones are still hot.

25:48.433 --> 25:53.014
[SPEAKER_28]: I'll just tell you what part isn't in it instead of telling you it starts here and ends here.

25:53.034 --> 25:54.234
[SPEAKER_35]: Just tell us what parts are in it.

25:57.563 --> 26:01.826
[SPEAKER_35]: Oh, okay, here we go.

26:01.946 --> 26:04.508
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, yeah, this is obviously the intro to the song.

26:04.528 --> 26:05.268
[SPEAKER_28]: We have that too.

26:29.904 --> 26:34.510
[SPEAKER_28]: This part right here actually is also in it.

26:34.870 --> 26:40.697
[SPEAKER_28]: The section of the music that sounded just like this a second ago, that's not in it.

26:40.977 --> 26:42.179
[SPEAKER_28]: There's a bit of a difference.

27:09.946 --> 27:17.211
[SPEAKER_28]: This part right here is not in the game at all, so whenever the guy is singing by himself like this, it's not in there.

27:17.931 --> 27:20.573
[SPEAKER_28]: Which is not a big loss, even though I think the song is still good.

27:56.737 --> 27:58.938
This music right here is still not in it.

27:58.958 --> 28:01.259
Trust me, there is music in this song that we have, so... It's...

28:25.023 --> 28:31.727
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, I don't... It's the chatroom people, like, they know what they're talking about, too.

28:32.408 --> 28:36.350
[SPEAKER_28]: Once again, he's singing, so that means it's not in the game.

28:37.070 --> 28:45.736
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, pretty much, we have the beginning of the song and the end of the song.

28:45.756 --> 28:48.618
[SPEAKER_05]: We mixed at, uh... Oh, wait, what mix?

28:48.718 --> 28:49.278
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no.

28:49.298 --> 28:50.619
[SPEAKER_05]: This is on Ultramix.

28:50.639 --> 28:50.779
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude...

29:24.832 --> 29:26.993
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, this music, we actually have.

29:27.253 --> 29:29.194
[SPEAKER_28]: So, rejoice in it.

29:32.216 --> 29:32.937
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, yeah.

29:33.077 --> 29:35.138
[SPEAKER_28]: The first time I heard this was like 80s music, but...

29:54.102 --> 29:57.657
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, actually, from here on out, the rest is an ultramix, so...

30:28.796 --> 30:45.329
[SPEAKER_28]: So yeah, this song will definitely... From people I've talked to that have heard this song, they think it's probably going to be the breakout song for this mix.

30:46.090 --> 30:49.392
[SPEAKER_28]: And this music right here is not actually in the game, I lied.

30:50.173 --> 30:53.556
[SPEAKER_28]: So just up until the point where he kind of fades out is in the game.

31:00.259 --> 31:02.300
[SPEAKER_35]: I'll let the last 30 seconds of the full mix play off.

31:06.221 --> 31:14.043
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, now isn't this totally a goth song?

31:14.103 --> 31:16.004
[SPEAKER_28]: Shouldn't you be wearing black nail polish and makeup?

31:20.925 --> 31:25.626
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright, that's Echo Image with Skulk with Seeger doing some narrations there about what's in and not in the game.

31:25.646 --> 31:26.487
[SPEAKER_28]: My new favorite band.

31:27.067 --> 31:27.667
[SPEAKER_28]: I love it.

31:28.756 --> 31:34.440
[SPEAKER_35]: So you were kind of saying over there, but they might not have heard it, what was kind of the reaction to this song around the office from the testers?

31:35.441 --> 31:39.564
[SPEAKER_28]: People think it's a really great song, and it's probably going to be like the breakout song for the game.

31:40.565 --> 31:51.114
[SPEAKER_28]: Because, I mean, it's from a band you've never heard of, and so now you'll know that... What?

31:51.914 --> 31:55.437
[SPEAKER_28]: It's like, you can go find their CDs if you hunt hard enough for...

31:58.266 --> 32:07.990
[SPEAKER_28]: But I wouldn't be surprised if we do Ultramix 3 or something, that we might have to pay a lot of money to get some band like this now.

32:08.451 --> 32:09.971
[SPEAKER_28]: If it really is that well-received.

32:11.192 --> 32:12.933
[SPEAKER_35]: I think it's a great song, and I agree.

32:12.973 --> 32:17.455
[SPEAKER_35]: I think it's going to be one of those songs that suddenly the band is going to get noticed by all these DDR people.

32:17.475 --> 32:19.475
[SPEAKER_35]: They're going to be like, why don't these DDR people go away?

32:20.956 --> 32:22.057
[SPEAKER_35]: I think it's a great song.

32:22.117 --> 32:27.019
[SPEAKER_35]: I kind of compared it to Dark Black Forest, which I sort of saw as kind of like a breakout song from Max USA.

32:27.039 --> 32:28.620
[SPEAKER_35]: I know a lot of people kind of feel eh about it.

32:28.981 --> 32:32.062
[SPEAKER_35]: But it was kind of a song like nobody knew who the hell that guy was.

32:32.382 --> 32:35.944
[SPEAKER_35]: And then a lot of people were like, hey, the song's pretty cool, except for that vocal part.

32:36.465 --> 32:37.225
[SPEAKER_18]: Where are we going?

32:38.166 --> 32:39.206
[SPEAKER_35]: Now here's what they need to do.

32:39.967 --> 32:45.810
[SPEAKER_30]: Because there's going to be, of course, a lot of these commercial artists, some of which might not be known.

32:46.462 --> 32:56.104
[SPEAKER_30]: They need to do what they've done with DDR Extreme and do their live shows, tour these people that you might not have heard of before and do these songs in a giant tour.

32:56.144 --> 32:56.624
[SPEAKER_30]: That'd be awesome.

32:56.904 --> 33:06.866
[SPEAKER_28]: The kind of sad thing about it, though, since I'm now a huge fan of this band, is that this song is back from 2001, and I believe it's the singer has left the band.

33:08.087 --> 33:13.868
[SPEAKER_28]: Actually, if you go to their website, echoimage.com, I believe, they have new tracks that they're working on up

33:14.298 --> 33:17.839
[SPEAKER_28]: for download, or they did last time I checked, to kind of show off some of their new stuff.

33:18.079 --> 33:22.060
[SPEAKER_28]: I haven't actually listened to their new stuff yet, but this CD's good, so I guess that's all that matters.

33:24.301 --> 33:25.541
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright, so I hope you enjoyed that track.

33:25.561 --> 33:26.781
[SPEAKER_35]: Anybody else want to comment on the song?

33:27.161 --> 33:30.482
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, I think Denise Richards has a really big butt.

33:30.962 --> 33:32.143
[SPEAKER_35]: That has nothing to do with the song!

33:32.223 --> 33:32.743
[SPEAKER_35]: Shush!

33:35.356 --> 33:35.916
[SPEAKER_35]: Shame on you.

33:36.596 --> 33:41.878
[SPEAKER_35]: Anybody else want to comment on... Rice Princess, I know you go to... Well, I'll get back to Rice Princess.

33:42.058 --> 33:43.318
[SPEAKER_35]: Let DarkSakura make her comment.

33:44.039 --> 33:46.559
[SPEAKER_35]: Rice Princess, just give the mic to somebody.

33:47.160 --> 33:47.880
[SPEAKER_35]: Give it to DarkSakura.

33:48.360 --> 33:48.940
[SPEAKER_35]: She's the host.

33:48.960 --> 33:49.540
[SPEAKER_35]: She gets to talk.

33:49.660 --> 33:50.721
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm sorry.

33:50.741 --> 33:51.201
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm so sorry.

33:51.401 --> 33:54.322
[SPEAKER_35]: Rice Princess, I know you go to a lot of goth clubs sometimes.

33:54.762 --> 33:55.022
[SPEAKER_35]: So many.

33:55.162 --> 33:56.062
[SPEAKER_35]: Or at least one.

33:56.502 --> 33:58.023
[SPEAKER_35]: Is that a song you'd expect to hear there?

33:59.182 --> 34:03.985
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know... As the night is tragic!

34:05.526 --> 34:08.208
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't sound like a bat, so... No, I'm kidding.

34:09.589 --> 34:10.530
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it doesn't.

34:10.730 --> 34:15.053
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't sound anything like I would hear at a goth club.

34:15.093 --> 34:18.135
[SPEAKER_30]: I could definitely hear that at an industrial type club.

34:18.375 --> 34:23.218
[SPEAKER_30]: Something that would play like KMFDM and stuff like that could definitely go into this.

34:23.879 --> 34:23.999
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

34:25.168 --> 34:26.209
[SPEAKER_29]: You got goth served.

34:28.230 --> 34:30.952
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's just a little too techno.

34:30.972 --> 34:34.294
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe I'm just used to more of the stuff that was out in the 90s.

34:34.754 --> 34:38.656
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe the new goth stuff is different, but I don't know.

34:38.736 --> 34:43.179
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't really heard a lot of new gothic music, so.

34:44.482 --> 34:52.367
[SPEAKER_28]: Also, I wanted to point out while I was looking for this CD in the goth section, I found stuff like Delirium in there, which I don't think they're goth.

34:52.387 --> 34:53.968
[SPEAKER_30]: Delirium, no, that was in there.

34:54.048 --> 34:54.588
[SPEAKER_30]: Is that right?

34:54.648 --> 34:55.549
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah, that's right.

34:56.829 --> 35:01.252
[SPEAKER_29]: You know, the whole thing that's been going on with the gothic scene nowadays is they're all gravers.

35:01.912 --> 35:04.954
[SPEAKER_29]: And if you don't know what a graver is, it's like a gothic raver.

35:04.994 --> 35:07.776
[SPEAKER_29]: See, what... Who is wrapping up my chamber door?

35:07.836 --> 35:08.376
[SPEAKER_29]: Open the door, dammit!

35:11.628 --> 35:13.909
[SPEAKER_30]: Okay, you do not touch the cable modem.

35:15.109 --> 35:15.890
[SPEAKER_30]: Don't even look at it!

35:16.290 --> 35:20.091
[SPEAKER_30]: Walk in, enter, move towards, away from the cable modem.

35:20.771 --> 35:21.331
[SPEAKER_35]: There you go.

35:22.232 --> 35:22.892
[SPEAKER_30]: We're safe.

35:23.452 --> 35:35.256
[SPEAKER_35]: Again, for those who are just joining us tonight, Comcast's modem that we have from them has been giving us issues all week, so we're afraid that if anybody looks at it funny, we're going to disconnect, and all you guys will get dropped from the show, and we'll have to reconnect and all that ugly stuff.

35:35.296 --> 35:36.956
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh, sure, don't introduce our guest.

35:37.216 --> 35:38.196
[SPEAKER_35]: Oh, yeah, Explicit's here.

35:38.236 --> 35:39.597
[SPEAKER_35]: Well, he's been here every week, so...

35:40.669 --> 35:42.911
[SPEAKER_35]: We have to... They know who he is.

35:43.331 --> 35:43.651
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright.

35:46.413 --> 35:49.255
[SPEAKER_35]: Jamie, you had a comment you wanted to make earlier and we weren't able to get to.

35:49.295 --> 35:51.697
[SPEAKER_35]: Yeah, you raised your hand trying to grab the mic and you didn't get it.

35:54.479 --> 35:55.260
[SPEAKER_09]: I like the song.

35:55.700 --> 35:55.940
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

35:57.821 --> 35:58.122
[SPEAKER_35]: Right on.

35:58.182 --> 35:59.923
[SPEAKER_35]: So like on a cage match scale of 1 to 10?

36:01.184 --> 35:59.923
8.

36:02.365 --> 36:05.527
[SPEAKER_09]: 8?

36:02.445 --> 36:05.527
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it was kind of repetitive and then it changed.

36:06.408 --> 36:06.688
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like...

36:07.870 --> 36:10.952
[SPEAKER_09]: I was sort of like falling back into the whole, okay, this is cool.

36:11.532 --> 36:12.373
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh wait, it's different now.

36:13.213 --> 36:14.014
[SPEAKER_09]: So that was good.

36:14.894 --> 36:18.376
[SPEAKER_09]: I like songs that sort of get me stuck on a pattern and then change suddenly.

36:18.817 --> 36:19.657
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's pretty cool.

36:19.677 --> 36:19.997
[SPEAKER_11]: Right on.

36:21.758 --> 36:22.339
[SPEAKER_09]: I listen to it.

36:23.339 --> 36:29.483
[SPEAKER_35]: So I'm trying to think if there's any other Ultramix or Extreme related questions that we can ask Sigurd.

36:30.944 --> 36:32.145
[SPEAKER_07]: What color is the box?

36:32.465 --> 36:33.365
[SPEAKER_35]: Stop.

36:35.207 --> 36:35.727
[SPEAKER_35]: What, uh...

36:36.624 --> 36:39.164
[SPEAKER_35]: Well, actually, I have questions about other Konami games.

36:41.385 --> 36:42.545
[SPEAKER_28]: I can try to answer them.

36:43.585 --> 36:48.066
[SPEAKER_35]: Can you give us any new news on Silent Hill 4 The Room, other than the fact that it's coming out soon?

36:49.966 --> 36:56.708
[SPEAKER_28]: It's really fun, and I've beaten it many times.

36:56.988 --> 37:00.048
[SPEAKER_28]: No, it's coming out for Xbox here.

37:00.948 --> 37:02.189
[SPEAKER_28]: That and PC, I guess.

37:02.229 --> 37:04.829
[SPEAKER_28]: That's the big thing about Silent Hill 4 here, and the soundtrack.

37:05.270 --> 37:08.051
[SPEAKER_28]: which we kind of talked about a couple weeks ago.

37:09.272 --> 37:09.892
[SPEAKER_28]: It was really good.

37:09.912 --> 37:13.134
[SPEAKER_28]: Jamie managed to get a copy of it, right?

37:14.054 --> 37:14.555
[SPEAKER_35]: From the store?

37:15.475 --> 37:17.476
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, it's out available now.

37:17.516 --> 37:20.057
[SPEAKER_28]: I think it's really only for pre-orders.

37:22.439 --> 37:25.440
[SPEAKER_28]: And people who live with GameStop employees, apparently.

37:26.120 --> 37:26.881
[SPEAKER_28]: Those cheaters.

37:27.421 --> 37:29.202
[SPEAKER_28]: Not supporting Silent Hill 4.

37:30.282 --> 37:31.583
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, if it's pre-ordered, it's cool then.

37:33.224 --> 37:33.304
[SPEAKER_28]: Um...

37:34.275 --> 37:39.759
[SPEAKER_28]: But yeah, Silent Hill 5 has recently been talked about out on the internet.

37:40.420 --> 37:44.783
[SPEAKER_28]: It won't happen until the next generation of consoles, which is sad.

37:44.924 --> 37:46.445
[SPEAKER_28]: And you know, at the same time, it could be really good.

37:46.465 --> 37:48.486
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, not until the next generation consoles.

37:49.847 --> 37:55.052
[SPEAKER_28]: They actually really haven't decided which brand they're going to, if they're going to Microsoft or Sony.

37:55.472 --> 37:57.954
[SPEAKER_28]: They'll probably do both, but yeah.

37:59.373 --> 38:01.434
[SPEAKER_28]: So that's up with Silent Hill stuff, I guess.

38:02.074 --> 38:03.876
[SPEAKER_35]: Any news you can give us on Gradius V?

38:04.476 --> 38:06.237
[SPEAKER_35]: Well, I guess we all saw the Classic Gaming Expo, right?

38:06.257 --> 38:07.358
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, it's like coming out September.

38:07.418 --> 38:07.959
[SPEAKER_28]: What else is coming out?

38:07.979 --> 38:09.340
[SPEAKER_35]: You already caught up on Rumble Roses.

38:09.380 --> 38:10.340
[SPEAKER_35]: What else is coming out?

38:10.360 --> 38:10.981
[SPEAKER_35]: Suikoden IV.

38:13.142 --> 38:16.925
[SPEAKER_28]: It was originally slated for a hopeful November release.

38:17.345 --> 38:19.987
[SPEAKER_28]: It is now pushed back into January, which makes me sad.

38:20.848 --> 38:24.550
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank goodness my copy will be here next week.

38:24.750 --> 38:25.791
[SPEAKER_28]: The Japanese one, at least.

38:27.172 --> 38:28.233
[SPEAKER_28]: So I'll get to play some of that.

38:30.149 --> 38:31.189
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, we have a question.

38:31.209 --> 38:31.470
[SPEAKER_28]: Hold on.

38:31.790 --> 38:32.010
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

38:33.972 --> 38:37.995
[SPEAKER_28]: It's pretty cool.

38:41.838 --> 38:43.179
[SPEAKER_28]: I've not really had a chance to play it.

38:43.199 --> 38:44.920
[SPEAKER_28]: I've watched a little bit of it.

38:46.101 --> 38:54.468
[SPEAKER_28]: I know there are some people complaining about some issues that Konami's doing with the game, like the sprite models or something, how they're 3D now instead of 2D.

38:55.048 --> 38:57.850
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't understand the complaints...

38:59.659 --> 39:01.859
[SPEAKER_28]: But yeah, it looks pretty good.

39:02.740 --> 39:04.680
[SPEAKER_28]: Really nice, graphically.

39:07.061 --> 39:11.422
[SPEAKER_29]: Did you say somebody was complaining that they changed the sprites from 2D to 3D for E6?

39:12.322 --> 39:13.742
[SPEAKER_29]: Because the game was originally all in 3D.

39:14.802 --> 39:15.783
[SPEAKER_28]: That's what I'm saying.

39:16.743 --> 39:18.683
[SPEAKER_28]: But you know, internet people can be stupid.

39:21.204 --> 39:22.644
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, it's not Konami's decision.

39:22.684 --> 39:24.985
[SPEAKER_28]: You can't blame the company that's just bringing it out.

39:26.105 --> 39:26.925
[SPEAKER_28]: Or you can, I guess.

39:28.186 --> 39:35.592
[SPEAKER_28]: They did the same exact thing when Suikoden III came out, because they went to the crappy looking blocky 3D models.

39:40.777 --> 39:45.281
[SPEAKER_28]: Suikoden IV is the best looking game in that series.

39:48.044 --> 39:49.365
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, the game is pretty crap, actually.

39:49.645 --> 39:51.447
[SPEAKER_28]: It's got a good story, but it's not fun to play.

39:53.079 --> 39:53.699
[SPEAKER_35]: What other Konami?

39:53.719 --> 39:54.859
[SPEAKER_28]: Any other Konami games I'm missing?

39:55.300 --> 39:55.880
[SPEAKER_28]: Probably not.

39:56.020 --> 40:02.461
[SPEAKER_28]: Unless we talk about Yu-Gi-Oh, which I can't since I don't know anything about Yu-Gi-Oh and I don't care to know anything about Yu-Gi-Oh.

40:02.481 --> 40:03.261
[SPEAKER_35]: No, I'm sorry.

40:03.761 --> 40:04.481
[SPEAKER_35]: I don't care about Yu-Gi-Oh.

40:04.541 --> 40:08.822
[SPEAKER_28]: I tried playing it like they do in the show and you had to get really dramatic and that makes it fun.

40:09.422 --> 40:14.723
[SPEAKER_29]: I can't believe you work for Konami and you're not corrupted and play Yu-Gi-Oh like all the other employees do.

40:15.864 --> 40:17.764
[SPEAKER_28]: Not all the other employees, just a select few.

40:18.277 --> 40:24.883
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay, I want to ask a question, and you don't have to answer this if you can't, or if you've never even heard of this, maybe you, you know, hold on.

40:26.684 --> 40:44.400
[SPEAKER_29]: There's, shush, there's this thing going on on the internet that went on like a couple months ago or whatever, where somebody packaged up an image of Silent Hill 1 for PlayStation, and like did a custom hack of an emulator for, a PlayStation emulator for a computer, and

40:44.904 --> 40:51.073
[SPEAKER_29]: and sent it around the internet saying that it was a PC version of Silent Hill 1, even though there has never been a PC version of Silent Hill 1.

40:51.754 --> 40:53.817
[SPEAKER_29]: Has Konami ever, like, said anything about this?

40:53.857 --> 40:56.962
[SPEAKER_29]: Have they noticed this and said, like, hey, or anything about it?

40:58.164 --> 41:06.392
[SPEAKER_28]: Um, I have never heard of that personally, and I pretty much can say that there never was a Silent Hill PC version.

41:07.353 --> 41:09.995
[SPEAKER_28]: Um, once again, it's the internet full of stupid people.

41:11.036 --> 41:17.622
[SPEAKER_28]: Uh, but, yeah, if there were a Silent Hill PC version, I would be one of the people to know about it, so...

41:20.922 --> 41:26.685
[SPEAKER_35]: Crazy question from the chat room, and I think even I could answer this one, but... Okay, let me break their hearts.

41:26.985 --> 41:31.007
[SPEAKER_35]: Wants to know about the Simpsons arcade game ever possibly coming out on Game Boy Advance.

41:32.148 --> 41:33.068
[SPEAKER_35]: And I can answer this.

41:34.529 --> 41:37.030
[SPEAKER_35]: Acclaim does all the licenses for the Simpsons game, correct?

41:37.090 --> 41:37.570
[SPEAKER_35]: Not Konami?

41:37.650 --> 41:38.951
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah.

41:39.491 --> 41:40.752
[SPEAKER_28]: This is kind of related.

41:42.192 --> 41:43.113
[SPEAKER_28]: We got an email...

41:44.271 --> 41:48.054
[SPEAKER_28]: Some stupid person.

41:48.074 --> 41:49.575
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, I know, it's great.

41:50.656 --> 41:51.516
[SPEAKER_28]: I think of them highly.

41:53.097 --> 41:56.640
[SPEAKER_28]: Asking us to bring out a Final Fantasy VII fighting game.

42:00.122 --> 42:01.383
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, yeah, there's air guys, but...

42:02.156 --> 42:07.457
[SPEAKER_28]: I really don't remember when we merged with Square Enix, so... Squeenixnami.

42:08.657 --> 42:10.098
[SPEAKER_33]: Squeenixnami.

42:10.298 --> 42:10.958
[SPEAKER_33]: Squeenami.

42:17.119 --> 42:18.779
[SPEAKER_33]: I like Squeenami, I have to say.

42:19.420 --> 42:19.920
[SPEAKER_33]: Squeenami.

42:20.180 --> 42:26.921
[SPEAKER_28]: I mean, there's some funny people that send in some great emails, and that's just one of their best ones.

42:28.281 --> 42:30.722
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to know if you guys are going to release a good Ridge Racer.

42:32.668 --> 42:33.969
[SPEAKER_09]: I really like the Pac-Man car.

42:56.997 --> 42:59.598
[SPEAKER_35]: We each pick one song to play for you guys.

43:00.038 --> 43:02.559
[SPEAKER_35]: And you're going to pick your favorite of the three songs.

43:02.599 --> 43:12.384
[SPEAKER_35]: And the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio in our Bomani Music and More program, which is on the air 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

43:13.384 --> 43:13.724
[SPEAKER_35]: All right.

43:15.205 --> 43:18.286

[SPEAKER_35]: www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on chat.

43:24.443 --> 43:39.769
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright, and we're going to do the first song, which won last week, and it was a track that was by Outphase, quote-unquote, although we all deemed it to be fake, not really an Outphase song, but for whatever reason, you guys liked it anyway, and it was Loki's pick.

43:39.989 --> 43:44.731
[SPEAKER_35]: And the song is Nuon, and it won last week, so we only get to hear a clip of it, because it was the winner.

43:45.111 --> 43:49.573
[SPEAKER_35]: So here it is, Not Outphase with Nuon, last week's winner.

45:05.738 --> 45:06.499
Thanks for watching!

45:52.956 --> 45:55.117
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright, that was song number one in tonight's cage match.

45:55.157 --> 45:57.519
[SPEAKER_35]: DJ Taka and Tack with Outphase and Nuon.

45:57.599 --> 46:02.662
[SPEAKER_35]: Next up in tonight's cage match is Jamie's pick, but first... Sigurd!

46:03.883 --> 46:07.565
[SPEAKER_35]: Didn't you bring something else you wanted to play for our listeners tonight?

46:09.306 --> 46:10.126
[SPEAKER_35]: He's nodding yes.

46:10.467 --> 46:11.828
[SPEAKER_35]: They can't hear him because he's in the kitchen.

46:12.088 --> 46:15.670
[SPEAKER_35]: But I'll go ahead and play this sound clip that Sigurd wanted me to play for you guys.

46:18.512 --> 46:18.912
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it?

46:21.513 --> 46:22.354
[SPEAKER_35]: Here it is one more time.

46:24.997 --> 46:25.358
[SPEAKER_35]: Interesting.

46:25.378 --> 46:26.098
[SPEAKER_35]: Well, you know what?

46:26.118 --> 46:28.059
[SPEAKER_35]: We're going to help you guys out, though.

46:28.480 --> 46:31.681
[SPEAKER_35]: I happen to have the website that that sound clip came from.

46:32.622 --> 46:34.243
[SPEAKER_35]: So, enjoy.

46:36.044 --> 46:36.605
[SPEAKER_35]: One more time.

46:38.726 --> 46:40.907
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright, and I posted that website in our chat room.

46:40.967 --> 46:41.628
[SPEAKER_35]: Have fun, kids.

46:42.348 --> 46:44.109
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright, back into our cage match.

46:45.990 --> 46:47.711

[SPEAKER_35]: And what is your pick tonight, Jamie?

46:51.133 --> 46:52.915
[SPEAKER_09]: Something from Basement Jax.

46:52.995 --> 46:53.515
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't remember.

46:54.133 --> 46:55.794
[SPEAKER_35]: The song was Lucky Star, if you need it again.

46:55.814 --> 46:56.094
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.

46:56.114 --> 46:57.714
[SPEAKER_09]: Lucky Star from Basement Jacks.

46:58.055 --> 46:58.415
[SPEAKER_35]: All right.

46:58.975 --> 47:00.596
[SPEAKER_35]: Any particular reason you wanted to pick this song?

47:00.876 --> 47:02.736
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I like it.

47:03.877 --> 47:04.217
[SPEAKER_35]: All right.

47:04.517 --> 47:05.637
[SPEAKER_09]: I was high on NyQuil.

47:06.258 --> 47:06.918
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, DayQuil.

47:07.298 --> 47:07.598
[SPEAKER_35]: All right.

47:07.658 --> 47:07.998
[SPEAKER_35]: Here it is.

47:08.118 --> 47:10.279
[SPEAKER_35]: Basement Jacks with Lucky Star.

[SPEAKER_35]: It's song number two in tonight's cage match.

47:11.920 --> 47:12.160
[SPEAKER_35]: Enjoy.

47:33.837 --> 47:49.027
[SPEAKER_26]: We were up so ridiculously, beauty portrayed so innocently, us natives act immigratly, grew up carrying loads of property, little checks did cram for a while, I was born in the court of the puppeteers, I was a stand just for money on trial, robbery, fraud did affect me, kept me in the sky of the old building, but

48:33.152 --> 48:51.200
[SPEAKER_26]: I've come a little way in a little long time, from doing straight over reason, picking crime I've come far in a little long way, I would just like to say I feel fine Cause I was down for a little long day, straight right up here in red space, too bad I was left in a little long state, I would just like to say I feel great So don't make me laugh, put your mouth back, I've been no money for

48:56.607 --> 48:57.528
Thank you for watching!

51:48.817 --> 51:51.997
[SPEAKER_35]: Welcome back, that was song number two, Basement Jax with Lucky Star.

51:52.017 --> 51:54.538
[SPEAKER_35]: Let's go around and see what the folks in here thought.

51:54.558 --> 51:58.199
[SPEAKER_35]: But remember, it's up to you guys in the end, so you have to be in our chat room too, I guess.

51:58.879 --> 51:59.439
[SPEAKER_35]: DarkSakura.

51:59.799 --> 52:04.420
[SPEAKER_09]: I like songs with a lot of beat in them, a lot of rhythm, a lot of substance.

52:04.440 --> 52:07.081
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not too, hi, I'm floating on air sounding, you know?

52:08.206 --> 52:08.686
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll go next.

52:08.726 --> 52:10.147
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought it was kind of cool.

52:10.207 --> 52:14.449
[SPEAKER_09]: It actually kind of reminded me just a little bit of some of the J-pop stuff you've been playing for me lately.

52:14.469 --> 52:16.469
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I can see why you like that one.

52:17.530 --> 52:18.230
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a little bit.

52:18.310 --> 52:23.592
[SPEAKER_09]: It kind of sounds like a bit of that M-flow, a little bit.

52:35.937 --> 52:40.240
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm not so sure I dig the rapping, but I like the instrumentation quite a bit.

52:40.340 --> 52:42.762
[SPEAKER_35]: So, like, seven and a half, eight-ish.

52:43.103 --> 52:43.523
[SPEAKER_35]: Somewhere in there.

52:44.163 --> 52:44.664
[SPEAKER_35]: Uh, Jonas.

52:45.684 --> 52:46.485
[SPEAKER_35]: Explicit, sorry.

52:47.025 --> 52:48.847
[SPEAKER_40]: Don't worry, you can call me anything you want.

52:49.567 --> 52:52.990
[SPEAKER_40]: Um... Okay, okay, okay, no kidding.

52:53.010 --> 52:53.590
[SPEAKER_40]: Okay, daddy.

52:54.511 --> 52:56.012
[SPEAKER_40]: Okay, not everything, sorry.

52:56.452 --> 52:58.194
[SPEAKER_40]: Anyways, I'll give it an eight out of ten.

52:58.434 --> 52:58.974
[SPEAKER_40]: Pretty good.

52:59.675 --> 53:02.457
[SPEAKER_40]: I wouldn't give it, like, a nine out of ten, because it has some flaws and stuff, but...

53:03.680 --> 53:06.563
[SPEAKER_40]: It's not perfect, but it's pretty good for someone to listen to.

53:08.524 --> 53:09.325
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright, Angel?

53:11.046 --> 53:12.548
[SPEAKER_07]: Good instrumental, I liked it, it was cool.

53:13.789 --> 53:16.752
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know what I mean by when I say instrumental, so.

53:16.832 --> 53:17.212
[SPEAKER_35]: On 1 to 10?

53:18.073 --> 53:19.294
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, probably a solid 8.

53:19.474 --> 53:21.195
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright, solid 8 from Angel.

53:21.356 --> 53:23.938
[SPEAKER_35]: Uh, Sigurd and Rice Princess, do you guys have a comment on this one?

53:25.659 --> 53:26.680
[SPEAKER_35]: On this song, basic chat.

53:26.880 --> 53:27.881
[SPEAKER_28]: We're doing age match?

53:28.101 --> 53:29.042
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm eating a cookie.

53:29.463 --> 53:30.524
[SPEAKER_28]: So I give the cookie an 8.

53:32.262 --> 53:32.662
[SPEAKER_35]: All right.

53:33.022 --> 53:35.886
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm not even going to ask Rice Princess the smart-ass thing she has to say.

53:35.906 --> 53:37.828
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm just going to go to the next song, which is my song.

53:38.428 --> 53:42.513
[SPEAKER_35]: And as I promised last week, I am bringing in Danny Minow this week.

53:43.544 --> 53:45.285
[SPEAKER_35]: Except this is not one of her songs.

53:45.546 --> 53:47.767
[SPEAKER_35]: It's a song featuring Danny Minow.

53:47.787 --> 53:48.728
[SPEAKER_35]: So it's just her vocals.

53:49.088 --> 53:54.672
[SPEAKER_35]: And actually, the artist is Riva, who did a really good remix of Ayo with Rapture.

53:54.833 --> 53:57.354
[SPEAKER_35]: I don't know if you guys know that song, but if you know that song, you heard it in clubs.

53:57.374 --> 53:58.255
[SPEAKER_35]: They did that remix.

53:58.315 --> 53:59.016
[SPEAKER_35]: It's really awesome.

53:59.396 --> 54:02.698
[SPEAKER_35]: So this is Riva featuring Danny Minow with Who Do You Love Now?

54:02.758 --> 54:03.019
[SPEAKER_35]: Enjoy.

54:17.112 --> 54:25.194
And it's hard to know what you're thinking When it's hard to lock your head You're too promised in perception

55:26.753 --> 55:27.874
Thank you for watching!

57:34.475 --> 57:36.495
[SPEAKER_35]: All right, that was song number three in tonight's cage match.

57:37.135 --> 57:38.416
[SPEAKER_35]: Riva featuring Danny Minow.

57:38.536 --> 57:39.736
[SPEAKER_35]: Who do you love now?

57:39.836 --> 57:42.297
[SPEAKER_35]: Let's see if it was loved now or hated now.

57:42.417 --> 57:42.977
[SPEAKER_35]: DarkSakura.

57:43.698 --> 57:44.398
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Trancy.

57:45.998 --> 57:51.400
[SPEAKER_09]: And I like Trance, but lately I've just been so burned on Trancy Trancy.

57:52.160 --> 57:53.981
[SPEAKER_09]: But it was really good, so...

57:57.313 --> 57:59.355
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll give it a 7.5 to 8.

57:59.975 --> 58:01.236
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, it was good.

58:01.316 --> 58:02.016
[SPEAKER_09]: It was really solid.

58:02.377 --> 58:03.417
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright, sounds good.

58:03.617 --> 58:05.259
[SPEAKER_09]: And your voice didn't annoy me this time.

58:05.939 --> 58:07.620
[SPEAKER_35]: Me voting, I think it's great.

58:07.760 --> 58:08.061
[SPEAKER_35]: I give it a 9.

58:08.221 --> 58:08.921
[SPEAKER_35]: Enough said.

58:09.542 --> 58:09.822
[SPEAKER_35]: Loki.

58:10.842 --> 58:12.063
[SPEAKER_30]: Hi, my name's Danny Minow.

58:12.223 --> 58:14.145
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't have an original bone in my body.

58:16.502 --> 58:18.524
[SPEAKER_30]: She's basically Kylie Minogue, too.

58:18.904 --> 58:22.006
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm gonna take everything that she makes and make it my own!

58:22.086 --> 58:23.107
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah!

58:23.728 --> 58:32.114
[SPEAKER_09]: One thing you should know if you were paying attention to the chatroom, they're talking about how they took Kylie Minogue's leg, cut it off, and grew it in a giant nascent jar with toothpicks to grow Danny.

58:33.515 --> 58:37.779
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah, that's cool, you know, if you want to do that to, like, you know, some of the other hot chicks out there.

58:38.139 --> 58:38.920
[SPEAKER_30]: I'd be down with that.

58:39.740 --> 58:41.101
[SPEAKER_30]: That's all we need is hot clones.

58:41.682 --> 58:43.003
[SPEAKER_30]: Screw cloning ugly people.

58:43.403 --> 58:45.405
[SPEAKER_30]: Oh, yeah, I give it a seven, because it was...

58:48.666 --> 58:50.107
[SPEAKER_35]: TDR Angel, what did you think of that one?

58:50.547 --> 58:51.047
[SPEAKER_07]: I liked it.

58:51.267 --> 58:51.647
[SPEAKER_07]: Duh.

58:51.887 --> 58:57.349
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we all know why, right?

58:57.650 --> 58:58.850
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess I'll give it an 8.

58:59.070 --> 59:00.110
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright.

59:00.231 --> 59:03.712
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm not trying to compliment myself from last time, I just thought that, yeah, anyway.

59:03.892 --> 59:05.232
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright, an 8 from Angel.

59:05.472 --> 59:05.793
[SPEAKER_35]: Jonas?

59:06.393 --> 59:05.793
8.

59:07.533 --> 59:08.053
[SPEAKER_35]: 8, simply?

59:08.294 --> 59:08.534
[SPEAKER_35]: Simply 8.

59:08.654 --> 59:11.535
[SPEAKER_40]: Simply just sounds like, it sounds like the same, but still pretty good.

59:12.955 --> 59:13.756
[SPEAKER_35]: Dependent in a way.

59:14.156 --> 59:17.337
[SPEAKER_35]: Does anybody in the kitchen, Seager, RicePrincess, LinkSail, have a comment?

59:17.981 --> 59:18.742
[SPEAKER_35]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

59:44.497 --> 59:47.800
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright, song number two tonight, Basement Jacks with Lucky Star.

59:53.885 --> 01:00:03.273
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, song number three, Reva featuring Danny Minow, Who Do You Love Now.

01:00:15.089 --> 01:00:16.310
[SPEAKER_35]: All right, those are the three songs.

01:00:16.610 --> 01:00:21.494
[SPEAKER_35]: Place vote now, and you only have a minute to vote, so please place your vote now.

01:00:22.114 --> 01:00:25.617
[SPEAKER_35]: And we've got to hurry up and get through this, because I do want to open up guessing.

01:00:25.877 --> 01:00:26.297
[SPEAKER_35]: Not yet.

01:00:26.437 --> 01:00:30.260
[SPEAKER_35]: Do not send guesses on the song yet, but I'm going to open it up as soon as Cage Match Voting is over, so please hurry.

01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:32.261
[SPEAKER_35]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.

01:00:32.281 --> 01:00:35.363
[SPEAKER_30]: You know what that song sounded like, though, that Danny Minow song?

01:00:35.644 --> 01:00:36.964
[SPEAKER_30]: It sounded like that one...

01:00:38.183 --> 01:00:42.724
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't know, I don't know what to tell you.

01:01:04.516 --> 01:01:11.358
[SPEAKER_35]: Sigurd, I hate to tear you away from the conversation, but I had a really good question come in while the cage match was going on.

01:01:12.559 --> 01:01:13.139
[SPEAKER_35]: Oh, I know.

01:01:13.219 --> 01:01:15.560
[SPEAKER_35]: God, you mean I've got to come talk to Rob?

01:01:15.620 --> 01:01:16.760
[SPEAKER_35]: God, he's going to yell at me again.

01:01:18.941 --> 01:01:22.822
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, what are these people interrupting my conversation in the kitchen for?

01:01:23.042 --> 01:01:24.823
[SPEAKER_35]: All right, let's see.

01:01:24.863 --> 01:01:28.444
[SPEAKER_28]: The question was... Who is it by, so I know if I'm actually going to address it?

01:01:28.464 --> 01:01:28.904
[SPEAKER_35]: Cutress.

01:01:31.385 --> 01:01:32.445
[SPEAKER_35]: Is that microphone going out?

01:01:33.556 --> 01:01:34.277
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know, is it?

01:01:34.557 --> 01:01:35.157
[SPEAKER_28]: Hello?

01:01:35.197 --> 01:01:36.699
[SPEAKER_35]: Probably, I'm just hearing a lot of static.

01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:38.280
[SPEAKER_35]: Oh, it's the cords.

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:39.121
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright, careful guys.

01:01:41.243 --> 01:01:44.565
[SPEAKER_35]: Was DDR involved at all in Konami's Friday press event?

01:01:44.705 --> 01:01:53.973
[SPEAKER_35]: GameStop's coverage didn't have anything in it at all, even though it is covered in Karaoke Revolution Xbox, or I'm sorry, even though it did cover Karaoke Revolution Xbox and Karaoke Revolution 3.

01:01:55.895 --> 01:02:00.759
[SPEAKER_28]: To my knowledge, I don't believe there's any DDR information, but you have to understand that

01:02:01.255 --> 01:02:06.817
[SPEAKER_28]: We have lives on the weekend, and I didn't even know until today that there was a press event on, what, Friday?

01:02:07.437 --> 01:02:11.918
[SPEAKER_28]: So, like, I first heard about that stupid Suikoden IV pushback today.

01:02:12.518 --> 01:02:16.980
[SPEAKER_28]: And as Rob can attest, I was kind of vocal and loud and angry about it.

01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:19.460
[SPEAKER_28]: But, yeah, I don't think anything was announced.

01:02:20.861 --> 01:02:23.802
[SPEAKER_28]: Your best source of information will always be...

01:02:25.726 --> 01:02:36.353
[SPEAKER_28]: Something you'll hear from like the Vivid members on DDR Freak And Orangela- Orangela- That microphone's going out, can we get some electric tape on that?

01:02:36.573 --> 01:02:37.274
[SPEAKER_30]: God damn it!

01:02:37.654 --> 01:02:39.255
[SPEAKER_30]: Stop breaking the damn mic!

01:02:39.775 --> 01:02:41.336
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm gonna kill all you people!

01:02:41.376 --> 01:02:44.218
[SPEAKER_30]: You keep replacing mics every week because you keep swinging them around!

01:02:45.159 --> 01:02:46.760
[SPEAKER_30]: Or maybe spilling soda on them!

01:02:48.041 --> 01:02:54.487
[SPEAKER_35]: I am microphone... You guys are cutting out completely on the microphone.

01:02:55.307 --> 01:02:59.471
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm going to go to kind of like an emergency break here while we fix the microphone.

01:02:59.571 --> 01:03:05.036
[SPEAKER_35]: So let's go to... I'm going to tally up the cage match votes here.

01:03:06.037 --> 01:03:06.497
[SPEAKER_35]: Let's see.

01:03:06.897 --> 01:03:07.278
[SPEAKER_35]: Stop it.

01:03:08.899 --> 01:03:09.820
[SPEAKER_35]: Let's go to...

01:03:12.603 --> 01:03:13.625
[SPEAKER_35]: No, see, you can hear it.

01:03:13.745 --> 01:03:14.086
[SPEAKER_35]: All right.

01:03:15.308 --> 01:03:18.093
[SPEAKER_35]: Let's just go to air and we'll be back.

01:03:19.034 --> 01:03:19.255
[SPEAKER_35]: Air.

01:04:24.113 --> 01:04:26.474
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, we're back and hopefully we have that microphone fixed.

01:04:26.494 --> 01:04:26.835
[SPEAKER_19]: Not sure.

01:04:26.875 --> 01:04:27.395
[SPEAKER_19]: I yelled at it.

01:04:27.415 --> 01:04:28.556
You yelled at it and it works?

01:04:28.576 --> 01:04:29.056
Who's got it now?

01:04:49.008 --> 01:04:50.749
[SPEAKER_35]: See, it's not working right now.

01:04:52.250 --> 01:04:53.851
[SPEAKER_09]: I pushed it in and it sounds like it's working now.

01:04:53.871 --> 01:04:55.151
[SPEAKER_09]: See, I told you something was going on there.

01:04:55.171 --> 01:04:56.572
[SPEAKER_30]: It's because it doesn't like her.

01:04:56.652 --> 01:04:57.232
[SPEAKER_30]: It likes me.

01:04:58.433 --> 01:04:59.413
[SPEAKER_09]: This microphone likes me.

01:04:59.854 --> 01:05:05.957
[SPEAKER_09]: Look, it's working just fine now because I used my secret woman power on it and now it works.

01:05:07.938 --> 01:05:11.580
[SPEAKER_09]: I used the power of estrogen on this microphone.

01:05:13.700 --> 01:05:15.741
[SPEAKER_09]: The power of estrogen compels me.

01:05:17.082 --> 01:05:18.923
[SPEAKER_09]: I need a young priest and an old priest.

01:05:19.684 --> 01:05:21.005
[SPEAKER_09]: And some split pea soup.

01:05:21.665 --> 01:05:26.568
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm getting the last few votes for Cage Match titled It's Too Late to Submit a Vote.

01:05:26.728 --> 01:05:29.070
[SPEAKER_35]: Ooh, a lot of votes for that song coming in at the last minute.

01:05:29.710 --> 01:05:35.114
[SPEAKER_35]: But it doesn't look like it's going to be enough to top this one, who has won for this week's Cage Match.

01:05:38.736 --> 01:05:41.058
[SPEAKER_35]: Once again, not outphased with Nuance.

01:05:42.782 --> 01:05:47.125
[SPEAKER_35]: A lot of votes there coming in at the last second for Basement Jacks, but not enough.

01:05:47.506 --> 01:05:49.747
[SPEAKER_35]: And actually, Danny Minow almost tied it.

01:05:49.928 --> 01:05:51.369
[SPEAKER_35]: Almost tied it, about two votes short.

01:05:52.930 --> 01:05:55.172
[SPEAKER_35]: Britney Spears.

01:05:55.492 --> 01:05:57.673
[SPEAKER_35]: They only heard the last part of that Britney Spears thing.

01:05:58.174 --> 01:05:59.175
[SPEAKER_09]: Britney Spears next week.

01:05:59.355 --> 01:05:59.755
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

01:06:00.195 --> 01:06:00.596
[SPEAKER_09]: Next week.

01:06:01.516 --> 01:06:03.278
[SPEAKER_09]: Next week I make you all listen to Toxic.

01:06:04.819 --> 01:06:05.159
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright.

01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:07.561
[SPEAKER_35]: Or like more J-Lo.

01:06:07.901 --> 01:06:09.923
[SPEAKER_35]: I want to talk about some other Bomani news that came up.

01:06:10.063 --> 01:06:10.683
[SPEAKER_35]: Oh, by the way...

01:06:12.682 --> 01:06:21.265
[SPEAKER_35]: By the way, now you guys, you can submit three minutes, you guys, to submit a guess for the new Ultramix 2 song based off of two clues we've given you tonight.

01:06:21.645 --> 01:06:23.726
[SPEAKER_35]: Send a private message to Sky if you have a guess.

01:06:24.166 --> 01:06:28.707
[SPEAKER_35]: Remember, the winner will get to be the first to say what it is, because we'll say that they were right, and then they can tell.

01:06:28.767 --> 01:06:29.848
[SPEAKER_35]: And they can tell us over Skype.

01:06:30.228 --> 01:06:34.749
[SPEAKER_35]: If you go to our website and do the Interact With Us feature, you can tell us through Skype.

01:06:34.829 --> 01:06:35.370
[SPEAKER_35]: It's pretty cool.

01:06:35.790 --> 01:06:39.651
[SPEAKER_35]: So you have three minutes to submit a guess, so I suggest you do so.

01:06:41.612 --> 01:06:42.112
[SPEAKER_35]: Meanwhile,

01:06:43.567 --> 01:06:47.253
[SPEAKER_35]: I want to talk about some other Bomani news that came up this week.

01:06:55.613 --> 01:06:58.316
[SPEAKER_35]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:07:20.091 --> 01:07:21.453
[SPEAKER_35]: It was something called DDR Festival.

01:07:21.773 --> 01:07:26.419
[SPEAKER_35]: But then Konami pulled it off their page, but... What?

01:07:26.659 --> 01:07:27.160
[SPEAKER_35]: What, Sigurd?

01:07:29.683 --> 01:07:30.964
[SPEAKER_35]: Sigurd, come here and tell us about this.

01:07:39.414 --> 01:07:39.715
[SPEAKER_35]: Sigurd.

01:07:41.192 --> 01:07:44.413
[SPEAKER_35]: Yes, you gotta jiggle the cord if you can't hear yourself because the speaker's here.

01:07:44.493 --> 01:07:49.354
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, um, I don't know why people are like, oh, they took it down, it's not real.

01:07:49.494 --> 01:07:52.355
[SPEAKER_28]: It's a real game, it's been announced, people are taking pre-orders for it.

01:07:52.815 --> 01:07:53.275
[SPEAKER_35]: Shut up.

01:07:54.156 --> 01:07:57.016
[SPEAKER_35]: Is there anything you can tell us about DDR Festival?

01:07:57.517 --> 01:07:58.677
[SPEAKER_28]: Um, not really.

01:07:59.777 --> 01:08:01.058
[SPEAKER_28]: Festival, not, yeah.

01:08:01.098 --> 01:08:01.858
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm sorry, Festival.

01:08:02.218 --> 01:08:04.499
[SPEAKER_28]: Um, no, not really.

01:08:04.939 --> 01:08:09.360
[SPEAKER_28]: I know a little bit of stuff, but nothing I can actually say.

01:08:10.436 --> 01:08:11.957
[SPEAKER_35]: All right, nothing you can actually say, that's fine.

01:08:12.477 --> 01:08:18.459
[SPEAKER_35]: All right, anything you've heard about the pop music in the 8th style stuff?

01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:29.183
[SPEAKER_28]: That's all, like, Konami of Japan stuff, and, you know, it's all taken care of over there, so... All right.

01:08:29.843 --> 01:08:33.364
[SPEAKER_28]: If it comes through our offices, though, you won't hear about it until it comes out.

01:08:34.365 --> 01:08:36.605
[SPEAKER_28]: Because it'd be, like, a huge thing, probably.

01:08:38.706 --> 01:08:41.007
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright, so what was your guys' reaction?

01:08:41.027 --> 01:08:47.191
[SPEAKER_35]: Because I know that there's been a lot of, like, kind of questions, like, when's Pop Music 10 going to be announced?

01:08:47.211 --> 01:08:56.317
[SPEAKER_35]: Because I even know that Navi, our resident Poppin' Music whore, was here a couple weeks ago, and he was kind of like, usually about now would be when they're announcing Poppin' 10, but they haven't yet.

01:08:56.617 --> 01:09:01.800
[SPEAKER_35]: And then to kind of get 8th style, without a two-year wait, like we, it felt like we had last time.

01:09:01.820 --> 01:09:07.404
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, Konami had huge success with 7th style, so obviously it made sense to them to bring out 8th.

01:09:08.064 --> 01:09:12.948
[SPEAKER_28]: As for Poppin Music, if you're worried about that going away anytime soon, just look at the arcade one.

01:09:12.988 --> 01:09:17.752
[SPEAKER_28]: It's like on, you know, Poppin Music 387, since they come out daily, pretty much.

01:09:19.286 --> 01:09:19.806
[SPEAKER_28]: D.R.

01:09:19.826 --> 01:09:21.287
[SPEAKER_28]: was a surprise, though, that's for sure.

01:09:22.108 --> 01:09:22.408
[SPEAKER_35]: Yeah.

01:09:22.428 --> 01:09:23.049
[SPEAKER_28]: It's Japan.

01:09:23.449 --> 01:09:28.573
[SPEAKER_35]: But, well, I guess you probably can't say if there's any truth to the eye toy thing or not, but I know that's a rumor that's going around.

01:09:28.593 --> 01:09:29.593
[SPEAKER_28]: That is a rumor indeed.

01:09:29.693 --> 01:09:32.095
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright, but you cannot, neither confirm or deny it, that's fine.

01:09:32.535 --> 01:09:42.723
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright, um, so, what about, like, style, I know you said this before on the show, something about 2DX8 style coming out was the biggest thing for you, and now here's the news, November 18th.

01:09:42.823 --> 01:09:47.246
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh, I freaking, yeah, like, 7th style, I really like the soundtrack a lot, because that was the

01:09:48.001 --> 01:09:53.022
[SPEAKER_29]: To me, that's the Kuria Moka soundtrack, you know, it's got the most Kuria Moka tunes as any soundtrack.

01:09:53.923 --> 01:10:02.145
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh yeah, 5th, it's got a lot too, but I just, every single Kuria Moka song on 7th is like my favorite, which is kind of weird, three songs being my favorite, but whatever.

01:10:02.765 --> 01:10:15.628
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, so I like 7th style, but I hated the, you know, obviously the price tag is way too high, and the whole, like, the whole problems we had to go through just to get it, you know, going on the Japanese site and getting fake, you know, information just to get them to send it here.

01:10:16.149 --> 01:10:16.749
[SPEAKER_29]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:10:46.209 --> 01:10:47.374
[SPEAKER_29]: Hopefully they'll continue to make them.

01:10:47.996 --> 01:10:51.732
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, even if they're not going to keep making DDR stuff, Japanese DDR games, then hey.

01:10:52.930 --> 01:10:55.491
[SPEAKER_29]: 2DX is my original love anyway, so.

01:10:56.092 --> 01:10:56.452
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright.

01:10:56.992 --> 01:10:57.813
[SPEAKER_29]: Or Beatmania, whatever.

01:10:57.933 --> 01:11:01.935
[SPEAKER_35]: Anybody else have anything they want to say on Poppin' Music 10 or 2DX 8 Style?

01:11:02.495 --> 01:11:03.776
[SPEAKER_35]: Angel's coming up to say something?

01:11:03.816 --> 01:11:05.537
[SPEAKER_09]: Gotta make my order, you know.

01:11:06.397 --> 01:11:09.479
[SPEAKER_35]: I am going to be so broke between all the games in the U.S.

01:11:09.559 --> 01:11:10.079
[SPEAKER_35]: coming out.

01:11:10.559 --> 01:11:12.100
[SPEAKER_35]: Oh, God, I just want to scream.

01:11:12.140 --> 01:11:12.761
[SPEAKER_35]: It's so horrible.

01:11:13.721 --> 01:11:16.222
[SPEAKER_35]: I mean, it's great, but at the same time, my bank account is crying.

01:11:17.063 --> 01:11:17.263
[SPEAKER_35]: Angel.

01:11:18.354 --> 01:11:19.035
[SPEAKER_07]: Here goes the mic again.

01:11:19.075 --> 01:11:19.995
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, never mind, I can hear myself.

01:11:20.035 --> 01:11:20.436
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay!

01:11:21.657 --> 01:11:27.781
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so I am definitely going to buy 2DX 8th and Pop Music 10.

01:11:29.603 --> 01:11:35.187
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully Love is Orange is on 2DX 8th, because, well, yeah, it's Orange Lounge.

01:11:36.388 --> 01:11:38.289
[SPEAKER_07]: I wasn't trying to make a pun there, but I guess I just did.

01:11:39.010 --> 01:11:41.111
[SPEAKER_07]: And Pop Music 10... Oh, you're fading out there.

01:11:42.252 --> 01:11:42.553
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn it.

01:11:42.773 --> 01:11:43.293
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, there we go.

01:11:43.774 --> 01:11:46.996
[SPEAKER_07]: Pop Music 10, obviously Goonies, because Goonies is cool.

01:11:47.631 --> 01:11:48.031
[SPEAKER_35]: Yes, it is.

01:11:48.752 --> 01:11:49.032
[SPEAKER_35]: All right.

01:11:49.873 --> 01:11:54.538
[SPEAKER_35]: I think we're going to go to... Oh, I wanted to do some more song guesses real fast.

01:11:54.578 --> 01:11:56.540
[SPEAKER_35]: Can somebody tell Sigurd to come in real fast?

01:11:57.341 --> 01:11:58.302
[SPEAKER_35]: Tell Sigurd to come in real fast.

01:11:58.322 --> 01:11:59.963
[SPEAKER_35]: They went outside to have a smoke or something.

01:12:05.149 --> 01:12:06.250
[SPEAKER_35]: Sorry, I got more guesses.

01:12:06.270 --> 01:12:06.410
[SPEAKER_35]: Yes.

01:12:10.512 --> 01:12:13.274
[SPEAKER_35]: William Tell William Tell William Tell William Tell

01:12:40.286 --> 01:12:41.567
[SPEAKER_35]: That was some good reasoning, though.

01:12:41.727 --> 01:12:42.567
[SPEAKER_28]: What was the reasoning?

01:12:43.068 --> 01:12:53.837
[SPEAKER_35]: Because he said something about tattletales, and then something about the galloping was supposed to symbolize the William Tell overture, because Tell, I don't know.

01:12:54.017 --> 01:12:57.600
[SPEAKER_28]: You can come up with good reasoning, and I'll give you a thumbs up for that, but still wrong.

01:12:58.120 --> 01:13:00.422
[SPEAKER_35]: MJSI24 says, across the nightmare.

01:13:00.562 --> 01:13:00.782
[SPEAKER_28]: No.

01:13:01.643 --> 01:13:04.906
[SPEAKER_28]: No reasoning also, so even if it was right, I wouldn't tell you.

01:13:05.577 --> 01:13:16.161
[SPEAKER_35]: And then we have, let's see, Kabut says, Bad Girls by Julia Roberts just because of that quote we played earlier.

01:13:16.341 --> 01:13:16.501
[SPEAKER_35]: No.

01:13:16.781 --> 01:13:16.921
[SPEAKER_35]: No.

01:13:17.241 --> 01:13:17.561
[SPEAKER_35]: All right.

01:13:18.481 --> 01:13:19.782
[SPEAKER_28]: But yay, you gave reasoning.

01:13:19.822 --> 01:13:20.222
[SPEAKER_28]: That's good.

01:13:20.322 --> 01:13:22.803
[SPEAKER_35]: I guess we'll have to do another hint somewhat soon.

01:13:24.093 --> 01:13:24.293
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah.

01:13:24.613 --> 01:13:25.113
[SPEAKER_35]: All right.

01:13:25.173 --> 01:13:28.094
[SPEAKER_35]: We're going to take a break, and we'll be back to talk about more stuff.

01:13:28.214 --> 01:13:30.534
[SPEAKER_35]: Maybe we'll get into the FUs of the week pretty soon.

01:13:31.454 --> 01:13:32.394
[SPEAKER_35]: That sounds like an idea to me.

01:13:32.414 --> 01:13:38.075
[SPEAKER_35]: We're going to get into the FUs of the week when we come back, so you can send FUs to Sky in the chat room.

01:13:38.355 --> 01:13:41.976
[SPEAKER_35]: After this break, featuring music from Poppin' Music 10 and 2DX8 Style.

01:13:42.036 --> 01:13:42.456
[SPEAKER_35]: We'll be back.

01:13:53.701 --> 01:13:54.582
[SPEAKER_19]: S, Actdeft, S, Actdeft

01:14:19.505 --> 01:14:20.668
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks for watching!

01:15:22.197 --> 01:15:30.243
Alright, we had more we wanted to play, but Sigurd, you had something you wanted to ask me about.

01:15:30.303 --> 01:15:32.445
You know that... Use my microphone.

01:15:50.066 --> 01:15:52.968
[SPEAKER_28]: You know that game show back in the day, Let's Make a Deal?

01:15:53.669 --> 01:15:54.830
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, I've heard of that show.

01:15:55.550 --> 01:15:59.033
[SPEAKER_28]: Remember when they would pick the wrong curtain and that funny thing would happen?

01:15:59.493 --> 01:16:01.294
[SPEAKER_28]: Like, yeah, yeah, yeah, the goat and stuff?

01:16:01.795 --> 01:16:03.336
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, that was great.

01:16:04.377 --> 01:16:06.578
[SPEAKER_35]: Yes, yes, I think so too.

01:16:07.039 --> 01:16:08.320
[SPEAKER_35]: It was clue-erific.

01:16:09.641 --> 01:16:10.802
[SPEAKER_35]: I think so too.

01:16:19.676 --> 01:16:20.581
Thanks for watching!

01:17:51.898 --> 01:17:52.883
Thanks for watching!

01:18:46.019 --> 01:18:47.261
Thanks for watching!

01:19:43.437 --> 01:20:03.330
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright, Orange Lounge Radio is here, and we'll do one more song, but for some reason it's come to my attention that not everybody may have picked up what Secret and I were talking about there before that song, so can we grab Secret again real fast, tell him I'm really sorry, but for some reason some people didn't hear it, so we'll do it one more time.

01:20:05.382 --> 01:20:09.285
[SPEAKER_35]: Sigurd, I'm sorry, for some reason people couldn't hear what you were asking me about.

01:20:09.305 --> 01:20:11.367
[SPEAKER_35]: I have no idea what the hell's going on, but some people missed it.

01:20:11.968 --> 01:20:13.329
[SPEAKER_35]: So again, we'll use my mic here.

01:20:13.569 --> 01:20:15.431
[SPEAKER_35]: You wanted to ask me about something during this break.

01:20:16.091 --> 01:20:21.636
[SPEAKER_28]: It's not going to be as cool this time, but hey, you know that show, that game show, Let's Make a Deal?

01:20:22.457 --> 01:20:23.918
[SPEAKER_35]: Yes, I still remember that show.

01:20:23.938 --> 01:20:25.379
[SPEAKER_35]: It's the one where they dress up and shit, right?

01:20:25.860 --> 01:20:30.644
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, wasn't it, or do you remember that thing, you know, when they picked the wrong door or curtain?

01:20:31.705 --> 01:20:33.026
[SPEAKER_35]: I do remember that, with the goats and stuff.

01:20:33.464 --> 01:20:35.705
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, that was awesome, wasn't it?

01:20:36.526 --> 01:20:38.547
[SPEAKER_35]: Why, yes, I think it was.

01:20:39.547 --> 01:20:41.789
[SPEAKER_35]: I think it's really great that you're asking me about it.

01:20:42.309 --> 01:20:45.311
[SPEAKER_28]: Isn't it clue-rific, or hint-tastic?

01:21:49.522 --> 01:21:50.183
Thanks for watching!

01:23:05.438 --> 01:23:11.283
[SPEAKER_42]: Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

01:23:16.087 --> 01:23:20.030
[SPEAKER_35]: We are back and some of you guys are probably doing a little bit of research right now.

01:23:20.170 --> 01:23:22.292
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm very interested in some of the stuff I'm reading in the chat room.

01:23:24.131 --> 01:23:30.937
[SPEAKER_35]: Very interesting theories going on there, so I can't wait to open it up to do another round of guesses, because I think maybe somebody could get it this time.

01:23:31.237 --> 01:23:37.142
[SPEAKER_35]: I think other people are just thinking we are completely smoking crack, which wouldn't be too far from the truth, actually.

01:23:37.543 --> 01:23:39.084
[SPEAKER_35]: So, yeah, secrets.

01:23:40.092 --> 01:23:46.977
[SPEAKER_28]: Um, and you know, if you read the extreme thread, we like to throw out stuff that doesn't make any sense, or might, or might not be a clue.

01:23:47.397 --> 01:23:52.861
[SPEAKER_28]: Um, this is actually an honest-to-goodness clue, I'll say that right now, so if you're thinking we're just, like, blowing smoke up, no, we're not.

01:23:53.661 --> 01:23:59.485
[SPEAKER_35]: If somebody gets the song tonight, so we actually get to play the song, then we will explain all the clues, as well.

01:23:59.785 --> 01:24:00.706
[SPEAKER_35]: And you're gonna hit yourself.

01:24:00.946 --> 01:24:01.326
[SPEAKER_35]: Or not.

01:24:01.426 --> 01:24:03.328
[SPEAKER_35]: Or you'll still think we smoke crack, which is fine.

01:24:03.588 --> 01:24:04.549
[SPEAKER_35]: You can go ahead and think that.

01:24:04.829 --> 01:24:05.369
[SPEAKER_35]: Uh, screw you.

01:24:05.609 --> 01:24:05.849
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright.

01:24:06.770 --> 01:24:09.753
[SPEAKER_35]: So now we're going to get into tonight's FUs of the week.

01:24:10.293 --> 01:24:17.899
[SPEAKER_35]: I advise you, though, that if you send your FU via the chat room, it better be good or it may not be read, because there's a lot of people in the chat room tonight.

01:24:17.940 --> 01:24:21.262
[SPEAKER_35]: We are only going to have to be selective in reading chat room FUs tonight.

01:24:21.322 --> 01:24:24.565
[SPEAKER_35]: So, Jamie, though, this is your baby, right, the FUs of the week?

01:24:24.985 --> 01:24:25.926
[SPEAKER_35]: Oh, hell yeah.

01:24:26.227 --> 01:24:28.789
[SPEAKER_35]: And why do we love the FUs of the week?

01:24:29.729 --> 01:24:30.610
[SPEAKER_35]: And I can't hear you.

01:24:30.630 --> 01:24:31.491
[SPEAKER_35]: Jiggle that mic thing.

01:24:31.551 --> 01:24:32.792
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to have an outlet somehow.

01:24:32.992 --> 01:24:33.693
[SPEAKER_35]: All right, here we go.

01:24:50.002 --> 01:24:55.027
[SPEAKER_09]: My first FU goes towards the great amount of roadkill I saw on Madison.

01:24:55.687 --> 01:24:58.290
[SPEAKER_09]: Lots and lots and lots of roadkill.

01:24:59.010 --> 01:25:03.334
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously, I like passed by like at least six dead squirrels.

01:25:04.215 --> 01:25:06.117
[SPEAKER_09]: One of them was like missing a head, it was gross.

01:25:06.758 --> 01:25:09.640
[SPEAKER_09]: And then there was this big pile of blood and gore.

01:25:13.784 --> 01:25:16.947
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm so glad the chatroom could not hear what you just said.

01:25:18.188 --> 01:25:28.977
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember one time, though, coming up here, I couldn't... By the way, to Cutress, I can't read private messages since I'm on the main cabinet.

01:25:30.078 --> 01:25:31.178
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm not at home.

01:25:31.679 --> 01:25:33.781
[SPEAKER_09]: So don't send me any private messages, please.

01:25:33.901 --> 01:25:34.121
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

01:25:35.147 --> 01:25:39.288
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to send me a message to get it later, just send me on DarkSakura.ssf and I'll read it when I get home.

01:25:40.088 --> 01:25:49.551
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, a big F you to sinuses and allergies for totally just screwing with my head today.

01:25:50.051 --> 01:25:52.912
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm on so much medication that it's not even funny.

01:25:53.372 --> 01:25:56.453
[SPEAKER_09]: And like, my poor cat, she's like, Mama, love me?

01:25:56.853 --> 01:25:59.854
[SPEAKER_09]: And she gets in my lap and I'm like, get out of my lap!

01:25:59.954 --> 01:26:01.074
[SPEAKER_09]: You're shedding in my nose!

01:26:02.048 --> 01:26:02.729
[SPEAKER_09]: So I had to push her off.

01:26:03.269 --> 01:26:11.595
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, a big F you to people who tailgate me when, like, people are going 15 miles under the speed limit in front of me and there's nobody in front of them.

01:26:12.356 --> 01:26:16.959
[SPEAKER_09]: And, like, I couldn't change lanes because I was, like, a block away from here.

01:26:17.340 --> 01:26:18.841
[SPEAKER_09]: It would have been pointless to change lanes.

01:26:19.101 --> 01:26:21.323
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, like, the guy suddenly turns and I'm like, you ass.

01:26:21.463 --> 01:26:23.684
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I was just completely pissed off.

01:26:23.744 --> 01:26:29.389
[SPEAKER_09]: And also, and this is not like a true F you because I adore my fiancé.

01:26:30.629 --> 01:26:33.751
[SPEAKER_09]: But when I don't want to be touched, stop trying to hold my hand.

01:26:37.134 --> 01:26:41.937
[SPEAKER_09]: If I'm PMSing and I don't want you to hold my hand or be lovey, don't do it.

01:26:43.118 --> 01:26:43.779
[SPEAKER_09]: Get my clue.

01:26:43.919 --> 01:26:44.459
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't do it.

01:26:44.959 --> 01:26:46.140
[SPEAKER_09]: Give woman space, please.

01:26:49.343 --> 01:26:53.005
[SPEAKER_09]: And then... I don't know.

01:26:53.325 --> 01:26:55.387
[SPEAKER_09]: I sort of lost my thunder there for a little bit.

01:26:55.407 --> 01:26:55.767
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

01:26:56.408 --> 01:26:56.848
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm sorry.

01:26:57.461 --> 01:26:58.922
[SPEAKER_09]: That's really got on my nerves.

01:26:58.942 --> 01:26:59.402
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sitting here.

01:26:59.742 --> 01:27:01.703
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm trying to drink my Pepsi at breakfast.

01:27:02.304 --> 01:27:07.547
[SPEAKER_09]: And, like, I'm so tired and aggravated and everything.

01:27:07.887 --> 01:27:09.368
[SPEAKER_09]: And Dan's like, I want to hold your hand.

01:27:10.548 --> 01:27:12.750
[SPEAKER_09]: And also, F you to people who called during the show.

01:27:13.990 --> 01:27:16.272
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't call the home line during the show.

01:27:17.272 --> 01:27:19.193
[SPEAKER_09]: Unless you don't know the show exists, then you're forgiven.

01:27:21.715 --> 01:27:22.695
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I guess that was it.

01:27:25.237 --> 01:27:25.557
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

01:27:26.528 --> 01:27:35.375
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, um, F you to having to install more crap on my computer when my computer space is supposed to be taken up by Stargate episodes.

01:27:36.496 --> 01:27:37.096
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so bye.

01:27:38.337 --> 01:27:40.699
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright, uh, Loki, your turn for your FUs of the week.

01:27:42.420 --> 01:27:47.904
[SPEAKER_30]: I'd like to start off with a big ha-ha to the fucking big rig that's out front of our apartment complex, Jackknife.

01:27:48.785 --> 01:27:49.265
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah!

01:27:49.686 --> 01:27:51.927
[SPEAKER_30]: So, uh, basically, yeah, my sister's coming back.

01:27:52.168 --> 01:27:55.070
[SPEAKER_30]: Anyways, um, so F you to them because they suck.

01:27:56.411 --> 01:27:57.931
[SPEAKER_30]: There's a jackknife, big rig up front.

01:27:58.332 --> 01:28:07.914
[SPEAKER_30]: Anyways, um, and, um, also, uh, fuck you to, um, the fucking Classic Gaming Expo for being so lame.

01:28:08.314 --> 01:28:14.176
[SPEAKER_30]: I mean, games were cool back then, just the people, just the people that play them now aren't cool.

01:28:14.696 --> 01:28:15.636
[SPEAKER_30]: So, you know, hey.

01:28:17.257 --> 01:28:18.177
[SPEAKER_30]: Um, oh wait, that's me.

01:28:19.537 --> 01:28:21.318
[SPEAKER_30]: Anyways, um, then, uh,

01:28:22.054 --> 01:28:27.217
[SPEAKER_30]: Fuck you, the goddamn IPAC, because I had to fucking rewire my entire cabinet just to get the damn thing to work.

01:28:28.538 --> 01:28:30.019
[SPEAKER_30]: But it works now, so that makes me happy.

01:28:30.639 --> 01:28:35.602
[SPEAKER_30]: And, um, fuck you to my soda cravings, because they're making it very difficult on me.

01:28:35.943 --> 01:28:39.085
[SPEAKER_30]: But I have to thank, uh, Lemonade.

01:28:40.345 --> 01:28:42.527
[SPEAKER_30]: Okay, good soda cravings.

01:28:42.647 --> 01:28:44.148
[SPEAKER_30]: Diet shit doesn't count.

01:28:45.185 --> 01:28:46.485
[SPEAKER_30]: That's like drinking water.

01:28:46.665 --> 01:28:48.466
[SPEAKER_30]: Actually, it's like drinking rancid water.

01:28:49.126 --> 01:28:52.027
[SPEAKER_30]: You know, I'd rather drink rancid water before a diet crap.

01:28:52.347 --> 01:28:53.348
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah, diet.

01:28:54.748 --> 01:28:55.008
[SPEAKER_30]: Okay.

01:28:55.388 --> 01:28:57.309
[SPEAKER_30]: But anyways, that's all I have right now.

01:28:58.069 --> 01:28:59.810
[SPEAKER_30]: I gotta go see this truck, because it's on fire.

01:29:00.570 --> 01:29:02.551
[SPEAKER_35]: Okay, we have an update.

01:29:03.011 --> 01:29:06.472
[SPEAKER_35]: Loki's... Wait, Loki, can we talk to Loki's sister here real fast?

01:29:07.802 --> 01:29:09.683
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's why I was... Hold on a minute.

01:29:10.023 --> 01:29:11.864
[SPEAKER_35]: Are we all stuck here right now?

01:29:12.045 --> 01:29:12.245
Yeah.

01:29:12.745 --> 01:29:13.686
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys can't leave.

01:29:13.766 --> 01:29:15.907
[SPEAKER_01]: The big rig is across the entire road going...

01:29:16.590 --> 01:29:17.951
[SPEAKER_01]: Eastbound or whatever direction that is.

01:29:18.051 --> 01:29:18.991
[SPEAKER_01]: No cars are moving.

01:29:19.031 --> 01:29:20.772
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's turning around and going back to Granite Bay.

01:29:27.035 --> 01:29:29.256
[SPEAKER_35]: Jamie wants the digicam to go take pictures.

01:29:30.176 --> 01:29:37.319
[SPEAKER_35]: We're going to go to a quick break while we figure out what the hell is going on in the FUs to be continued in just a little bit, guys.

01:29:37.359 --> 01:29:39.440
[SPEAKER_35]: Sorry for the delay, but there's a little bit of chaos.

01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:42.441
[SPEAKER_35]: Again, we are all stuck here at Orange Lounge Radio.

01:29:42.561 --> 01:29:43.682
[SPEAKER_35]: We are not allowed to leave.

01:29:44.162 --> 01:29:46.324
[SPEAKER_35]: Because there is a jackknife truck outside.

01:29:46.344 --> 01:29:46.764
[SPEAKER_35]: We'll be back.

01:33:24.984 --> 01:33:28.245
[SPEAKER_35]: All right, we are back, and if you missed, what the hell's going on?

01:33:28.285 --> 01:33:44.810
[SPEAKER_35]: Basically, there's been a giant accident on a main... We live on a very major artery that connects two towns together, and there's been a truck that looks like it was carrying new vehicles or something on it that kind of has jackknifed its way across the whole road.

01:33:45.030 --> 01:33:47.871
[SPEAKER_35]: So no cars can cross this road right now, which means...

01:33:48.311 --> 01:33:54.573
[SPEAKER_35]: That for a lot of the folks here at the studio, if they have rides coming in or something, they're not going to be able to get here unless they know to come a big back way around.

01:33:54.653 --> 01:33:56.674
[SPEAKER_35]: So it's going to be very interesting.

01:33:56.754 --> 01:34:03.456
[SPEAKER_35]: So sorry about that, guys, but that was very interesting because we thought for a moment we were stuck here if there was a big fire.

01:34:03.476 --> 01:34:06.057
[SPEAKER_35]: But it doesn't look like it's flaming or there's a fire going on anymore.

01:34:06.497 --> 01:34:08.098
[SPEAKER_35]: But Jamie did run out there with my camera.

01:34:09.138 --> 01:34:10.719
[SPEAKER_35]: And Loki's out there, too.

01:34:10.759 --> 01:34:14.580
[SPEAKER_35]: We are going to continue the show and doing the FUs of the week.

01:34:16.181 --> 01:34:16.281
[SPEAKER_35]: So...

01:34:17.538 --> 01:34:21.442
[SPEAKER_35]: We still got Sigurd here in Rise Princess because you guys already saw the accident.

01:34:21.482 --> 01:34:22.063
[SPEAKER_35]: Did you hear it?

01:34:22.303 --> 01:34:22.803
[SPEAKER_28]: I didn't hear it.

01:34:22.823 --> 01:34:25.005
[SPEAKER_28]: I didn't even hear it.

01:34:25.045 --> 01:34:26.367
[SPEAKER_28]: I was inside when it happened.

01:34:27.047 --> 01:34:34.475
[SPEAKER_28]: But I went out there and they told me about it and I was like, well, I'm sad for the person who's in the accident, but I'm not going to go right out and see it.

01:34:34.875 --> 01:34:35.195
[SPEAKER_35]: Weird.

01:34:35.496 --> 01:34:35.936
[SPEAKER_35]: Very weird.

01:34:36.016 --> 01:34:36.336
[SPEAKER_35]: All right.

01:34:37.498 --> 01:34:39.500
[SPEAKER_35]: Let's move on with the FUs of the week, shall we?

01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:40.901
[SPEAKER_35]: It was my turn when we left off.

01:34:47.194 --> 01:34:52.556
[SPEAKER_35]: My FU of the week goes to that accident going on out there and taking away from the show.

01:34:52.576 --> 01:34:53.337
[SPEAKER_35]: That was crazy.

01:34:53.357 --> 01:34:57.338
[SPEAKER_35]: Yeah, it was too crowded in here anyway, though, so that's a good point.

01:34:58.999 --> 01:35:05.001
[SPEAKER_35]: Also, just a big FU to me falling asleep while driving yesterday.

01:35:05.121 --> 01:35:05.702
[SPEAKER_35]: Not really, though.

01:35:07.842 --> 01:35:09.803
[SPEAKER_35]: Wait, Jamie's back.

01:35:10.223 --> 01:35:10.844
[SPEAKER_35]: Jamie's back.

01:35:11.584 --> 01:35:12.204
[SPEAKER_35]: Hold on.

01:35:13.285 --> 01:35:15.445
[SPEAKER_35]: Now that Jamie is interrupting my FUs, that's all right.

01:35:15.505 --> 01:35:16.566
[SPEAKER_35]: All right, Jamie, what were you saying?

01:35:17.571 --> 01:35:20.040
[SPEAKER_09]: That was the most goddamn boring accident I've ever saw.

01:35:20.321 --> 01:35:21.967
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's some stupid car driver's fault.

01:35:22.409 --> 01:35:23.312
[SPEAKER_09]: They ran into the truck.

01:35:24.676 --> 01:35:29.920
[SPEAKER_30]: Okay, now, I don't, now normally, okay, you might say, okay, I don't understand how you didn't see that car.

01:35:30.260 --> 01:35:32.502
[SPEAKER_30]: Or, I didn't, I don't understand how you didn't see that truck.

01:35:32.782 --> 01:35:37.266
[SPEAKER_30]: How about, I don't know how you didn't see that truck carrying a bunch of boats.

01:35:37.586 --> 01:35:38.907
[SPEAKER_30]: I mean, this thing is like a gigantic.

01:35:38.927 --> 01:35:39.587
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, they were boats.

01:35:40.048 --> 01:35:47.914
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah, okay, this thing is carrying about, it's about, imagine a, like, 12 foot tall wall that spans about 30 feet long.

01:35:48.094 --> 01:35:49.215
[SPEAKER_30]: How do you miss that?

01:35:50.015 --> 01:35:51.176
[SPEAKER_30]: While driving down the road.

01:35:52.017 --> 01:35:52.497
[SPEAKER_29]: Seriously.

01:35:53.138 --> 01:35:54.519
[SPEAKER_29]: I just think it's funny that for once

01:35:55.137 --> 01:35:56.598
[SPEAKER_29]: This show wasn't the only wreck.

01:35:57.579 --> 01:35:58.019
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up.

01:36:00.261 --> 01:36:02.603
[SPEAKER_35]: F you to Brad for that comment, you're a fucktard.

01:36:02.903 --> 01:36:03.184
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright.

01:36:04.705 --> 01:36:10.690
[SPEAKER_35]: Let's go on and hear from other folks in our studio, their FUs of the week, starting with LankyStyle, since he has a microphone.

01:36:10.710 --> 01:36:17.535
[SPEAKER_29]: F you goes to the proprietors of the house I'm living in, because now I have to go find a job very quickly and a new apartment.

01:36:17.735 --> 01:36:18.436
[SPEAKER_24]: Yay!

01:36:20.257 --> 01:36:24.541
[SPEAKER_29]: And I know it's very unlikely they could be listening to this show, but it's also possible they could be.

01:36:25.495 --> 01:36:26.675
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't fucking care what you think.

01:36:27.715 --> 01:36:28.536
[SPEAKER_29]: So, there you go.

01:36:30.196 --> 01:36:31.856
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright, very interesting.

01:36:31.936 --> 01:36:33.897
[SPEAKER_35]: Okay, Jonas, do you have any FUs you want to give out?

01:36:37.937 --> 01:36:43.878
[SPEAKER_40]: Okay, everyone probably said about the FU about the car wreck.

01:36:44.698 --> 01:36:45.639
[SPEAKER_40]: God, drivers.

01:36:45.979 --> 01:36:46.999
[SPEAKER_40]: Drive safely.

01:36:48.759 --> 01:36:50.720
[SPEAKER_40]: I don't have to keep mentioning this so many times.

01:36:52.060 --> 01:36:52.520
[SPEAKER_40]: Ugh.

01:36:53.462 --> 01:36:54.342
[SPEAKER_40]: No fucking comment on that.

01:36:54.602 --> 01:36:59.064
[SPEAKER_40]: Okay, F you to the server that I'm hosting my sims and my database on.

01:36:59.104 --> 01:37:00.124
[SPEAKER_40]: It keeps shutting down.

01:37:00.324 --> 01:37:00.644
[SPEAKER_40]: Damn it.

01:37:01.705 --> 01:37:05.886
[SPEAKER_40]: And people quit hacking on it and quit hitting the too much bandwidth.

01:37:05.906 --> 01:37:06.166
[SPEAKER_40]: Sorry.

01:37:06.966 --> 01:37:07.747
[SPEAKER_40]: Killing my bandwidth.

01:37:09.047 --> 01:37:10.568
[SPEAKER_40]: You know this is free for me, so.

01:37:11.588 --> 01:37:15.329
[SPEAKER_40]: Okay, F you to my current manager right now.

01:37:16.069 --> 01:37:17.630
[SPEAKER_40]: We're not giving me a damn raise.

01:37:18.090 --> 01:37:19.190
[SPEAKER_40]: Okay, I'm three steps back.

01:37:19.291 --> 01:37:20.611
[SPEAKER_40]: People would get paid like

01:37:21.437 --> 01:37:24.520
[SPEAKER_40]: A shitload, and I'm just here getting minimum wage for now.

01:37:27.062 --> 01:37:30.345
[SPEAKER_40]: And for the love of God, I'm helping your arcade try to get better a little bit.

01:37:31.266 --> 01:37:32.447
[SPEAKER_40]: Bring more business towards it.

01:37:33.628 --> 01:37:39.994
[SPEAKER_40]: Another F you goes to my former manager for getting two people to quit the job that I'm working at.

01:37:40.454 --> 01:37:45.659
[SPEAKER_40]: Thanks a lot, you're accusing people of stuff that they didn't even do.

01:37:47.222 --> 01:37:53.106
[SPEAKER_40]: You jumped into conclusions, immediately saying, oh, you caused a complaint.

01:37:54.227 --> 01:37:55.388
[SPEAKER_40]: You should not do this again.

01:37:55.408 --> 01:37:58.029
[SPEAKER_40]: And guess what, you just, they left.

01:37:59.630 --> 01:38:00.171
[SPEAKER_40]: Thanks a lot.

01:38:00.891 --> 01:38:09.177
[SPEAKER_40]: Okay, and another F goes to one of our former co-workers who quit immediately after some big incident that just occurred.

01:38:09.917 --> 01:38:10.678
[SPEAKER_40]: Thanks a lot.

01:38:10.978 --> 01:38:14.320
[SPEAKER_40]: The little kid who's 12 years old can no longer move.

01:38:14.380 --> 01:38:15.261
[SPEAKER_40]: He is paralyzed.

01:38:15.964 --> 01:38:29.634
[SPEAKER_40]: because you didn't watch his ass on the rock climbing it's funny that kids don't know what the hell to do now it's going to cost them, now we're going to get sued and if it goes out of business, where the hell are people going to play DDR now?

01:38:31.656 --> 01:38:33.497
[SPEAKER_40]: just think about it, RVL is dead

01:38:35.077 --> 01:38:41.502
[SPEAKER_35]: FU to Paradise Island because I tried to go there today to check it out and the state fair is going on.

01:38:41.822 --> 01:38:46.826
[SPEAKER_40]: Oh, another FU there for the cars being so fucking expensive, the parking.

01:38:47.566 --> 01:38:48.827
[SPEAKER_40]: Six bucks and stuff.

01:38:49.668 --> 01:38:50.128
[SPEAKER_40]: Or seven.

01:38:53.831 --> 01:38:58.094
[SPEAKER_40]: Well, CCL is somewhat okay, but I don't like the car system.

01:38:58.134 --> 01:38:58.915
[SPEAKER_35]: Anyway, sorry to interrupt.

01:38:58.935 --> 01:38:59.175
[SPEAKER_35]: Anyway.

01:39:01.256 --> 01:39:01.657
[SPEAKER_40]: Anything else?

01:39:03.018 --> 01:39:03.118
[SPEAKER_40]: Uh...

01:39:04.171 --> 01:39:05.652
[SPEAKER_40]: F you for time going fast.

01:39:05.712 --> 01:39:07.674
[SPEAKER_40]: I thought vacation is still like one month.

01:39:08.135 --> 01:39:10.296
[SPEAKER_40]: I'm now realizing that school is about to start soon.

01:39:10.817 --> 01:39:11.537
[SPEAKER_40]: Starting tomorrow.

01:39:12.959 --> 01:39:13.979
[SPEAKER_40]: Actually, I started school last week.

01:39:14.020 --> 01:39:14.480
[SPEAKER_40]: Sorry.

01:39:15.100 --> 01:39:16.662
[SPEAKER_40]: But still, time goes too fast.

01:39:18.804 --> 01:39:20.185
[SPEAKER_40]: I haven't gotten a chance.

01:39:20.725 --> 01:39:22.307
[SPEAKER_40]: I have not gotten time for any vacation.

01:39:25.549 --> 01:39:26.290
[SPEAKER_40]: F you for birds.

01:39:26.770 --> 01:39:28.071
[SPEAKER_40]: More birds shitting in my car.

01:39:30.634 --> 01:39:32.155
[SPEAKER_40]: Every time I clean my car, you all shit on it.

01:39:33.086 --> 01:39:39.371
[SPEAKER_40]: I should just get a gun, shoot the fuck out of all those birds.

01:39:40.171 --> 01:39:40.972
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright, anything else?

01:39:41.252 --> 01:39:41.813
[SPEAKER_35]: We gotta move on.

01:39:41.853 --> 01:39:42.333
[SPEAKER_35]: That's all.

01:39:42.453 --> 01:39:42.713
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright.

01:39:42.893 --> 01:39:43.794
[SPEAKER_35]: To be continued.

01:39:43.914 --> 01:39:44.194
[SPEAKER_35]: Angel.

01:39:45.415 --> 01:39:47.817
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, uh, whoa, okay, mic's working, yay.

01:39:47.917 --> 01:39:49.038
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh wait, this is a good mic, heh.

01:39:49.098 --> 01:39:51.280
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, what was I gonna say?

01:39:51.320 --> 01:39:51.700
[SPEAKER_07]: Dang it.

01:39:51.800 --> 01:39:56.244
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, um, F you to, to Accident, because I don't know if I'm gonna get home now.

01:39:56.564 --> 01:39:56.824
[SPEAKER_07]: Oops.

01:39:57.945 --> 01:39:58.826
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and...

01:40:00.425 --> 01:40:07.730
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's true, I got an R. Alright, and, oh yeah, FU to school starting, but it's okay because it's school, and maybe I can graduate.

01:40:09.331 --> 01:40:11.093
[SPEAKER_07]: And, what was I going to say after this?

01:40:11.253 --> 01:40:12.213
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I forgot what it was.

01:40:12.233 --> 01:40:12.814
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, well.

01:40:13.474 --> 01:40:14.635
[SPEAKER_07]: I forgot what my FU was.

01:40:14.735 --> 01:40:16.697
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn it, the really good ones that I needed to say.

01:40:16.777 --> 01:40:17.217
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, well.

01:40:18.458 --> 01:40:19.338
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, what the hell.

01:40:21.457 --> 01:40:23.419
[SPEAKER_35]: All right, let's move on to the chatroom FUs.

01:40:23.539 --> 01:40:28.904
[SPEAKER_35]: Gonna keep going here, because I want to get another chance to guess for the clue, because the accent kind of screwed us up, and we're a little bit behind.

01:40:28.944 --> 01:40:30.105
[SPEAKER_35]: So let's get to chatroom FUs here.

01:40:30.125 --> 01:40:31.226
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm going to pick some good ones here.

01:40:33.008 --> 01:40:35.971
[SPEAKER_35]: Esko says, FU to the stupidest group of music fans on the earth.

01:40:37.032 --> 01:40:47.141
[SPEAKER_35]: See, now that I work at a rock and roll merchandise place, I see a whole variety of music fans, from the stanky slackers to the frat kids who all buy five feet tall Bob Marley posters, but only a few really get on my nerves.

01:40:47.646 --> 01:40:51.228
[SPEAKER_35]: One has the exceptional ability to be racially offensive and moronic all at the same time.

01:40:51.268 --> 01:40:52.929
[SPEAKER_35]: That is, of course, the Juggalos.

01:40:53.250 --> 01:40:54.470
[SPEAKER_35]: ICP fans, if you didn't know.

01:40:54.811 --> 01:41:00.114
[SPEAKER_35]: We recently had a guy called Anybody Killer, who is apparently a member of their running crew, do a signing in our mall.

01:41:00.134 --> 01:41:02.416
[SPEAKER_35]: It was like a wave of stupidity engulfed the entire mall.

01:41:02.496 --> 01:41:08.980
[SPEAKER_35]: Rich teens speaking ghetto and putting face paint on, attempting to blend into a culture that was originally inspired by the sins of their parents' greed.

01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:12.102
[SPEAKER_35]: And they steal our shit and their annoying, um...

01:41:15.063 --> 01:41:16.845
[SPEAKER_35]: I don't even know what he's trying to say with that last bit there.

01:41:18.146 --> 01:41:18.626
[SPEAKER_35]: Moving on.

01:41:19.807 --> 01:41:24.912
[SPEAKER_35]: John Fields says, FU to not having a job, FU to DivX for their weird new compression that's worthless.

01:41:24.952 --> 01:41:27.975
[SPEAKER_35]: Videos that used to be 100 megs total are ending up as a gig on 5.2.

01:41:28.555 --> 01:41:30.057
[SPEAKER_35]: Where's my downgrade?

01:41:30.217 --> 01:41:32.199
[SPEAKER_35]: FU again to Microsoft for releasing XP2.

01:41:32.359 --> 01:41:32.859
[SPEAKER_35]: It sucks.

01:41:34.160 --> 01:41:34.661
[SPEAKER_35]: Moving on.

01:41:37.723 --> 01:41:41.227
[SPEAKER_35]: Karma Titan says, uh...

01:41:46.420 --> 01:41:52.184
[SPEAKER_35]: F you to Carmel Mountain Nickel City Arcade ripping off Konami's DDR machines by using Step Mania and charging people on Step Mania.

01:41:54.145 --> 01:41:54.706
[SPEAKER_30]: So what?

01:41:55.046 --> 01:41:56.367
[SPEAKER_30]: It's fucking better than DDR.

01:41:56.727 --> 01:41:57.187
[SPEAKER_30]: Get a load.

01:41:58.388 --> 01:42:06.474
[SPEAKER_30]: I mean, unless they're putting shitty-ass step files in there, which I can understand that, but, you know, the Step Mania itself is just another fucking game.

01:42:06.614 --> 01:42:07.995
[SPEAKER_30]: Just get used to it, man.

01:42:08.015 --> 01:42:11.217
[SPEAKER_30]: At least it's not some Korean knockoff or something like that.

01:42:11.690 --> 01:42:14.271
[SPEAKER_30]: These don't have no fucking techno motion shit in there.

01:42:14.772 --> 01:42:16.092
[SPEAKER_30]: Or like, you know, I can boogie.

01:42:18.734 --> 01:42:19.694
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright, now moving on.

01:42:19.774 --> 01:42:22.176
[SPEAKER_35]: Moo says, an F you of your own for Comcast?

01:42:22.576 --> 01:42:23.497
[SPEAKER_35]: How could I forget?

01:42:23.557 --> 01:42:24.857
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you, Moo, I agree.

01:42:25.338 --> 01:42:27.359
[SPEAKER_35]: A big F you to Comcast.

01:42:28.799 --> 01:42:29.160
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright.

01:42:31.121 --> 01:42:34.943
[SPEAKER_35]: Unknown Gamer says, a big ol' fuck you to people who don't pay me my goddamn money back.

01:42:35.303 --> 01:42:37.204
[SPEAKER_35]: Pay me back, mom, or it's your ass.

01:42:39.403 --> 01:42:40.163
[SPEAKER_35]: See, I like that one.

01:42:40.183 --> 01:42:40.864
[SPEAKER_35]: That was a funny one.

01:42:41.344 --> 01:42:41.584
[SPEAKER_35]: All right.

01:42:42.145 --> 01:42:46.307
[SPEAKER_35]: MJB says, My FU of the week goes to my friends for taking my PC and making me go on a Mac.

01:42:46.407 --> 01:42:48.708
[SPEAKER_35]: Oh, boo-hoo.

01:42:48.889 --> 01:42:53.911
[SPEAKER_35]: Cutress says, FU Orange Lounge for pwning me twice on my first listen on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:42:54.172 --> 01:42:55.512
[SPEAKER_35]: Please make sure you hat trick me.

01:42:55.853 --> 01:42:57.874
[SPEAKER_35]: I want one more pwnage before the end of the night.

01:42:58.074 --> 01:42:58.774
[SPEAKER_09]: We still love you.

01:42:59.895 --> 01:43:00.515
[SPEAKER_35]: No, pwn him.

01:43:01.536 --> 01:43:04.337
[SPEAKER_35]: And I hate the fact that I'm saying pwn, but he did say PWM.

01:43:05.898 --> 01:43:08.600
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll wait till I get to Möbius.

01:43:08.732 --> 01:43:09.592
[SPEAKER_35]: Yeah, we still have an hour left.

01:43:10.013 --> 01:43:10.313
[SPEAKER_35]: All right.

01:43:10.613 --> 01:43:14.655
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll have to come hang out with me at the Aladdin's Castle Ace to work at, at the cyber station.

01:43:15.615 --> 01:43:18.497
[SPEAKER_35]: He also says, F you to double amputees who can dance better than me.

01:43:22.159 --> 01:43:27.641
[SPEAKER_35]: Misty says, an F you to myself for hurting myself while playing DDR today, but I did end up getting quite a few new double A's.

01:43:28.082 --> 01:43:29.202
[SPEAKER_35]: Better yet, F you to school.

01:43:31.163 --> 01:43:35.425
[SPEAKER_35]: And Panda says, F you to losing the bid on eBay for about three gigs of RAM.

01:43:36.266 --> 01:43:36.686
[SPEAKER_35]: That's a lot.

01:43:38.380 --> 01:43:42.002
[SPEAKER_35]: and that's it for the FUs of the week.

01:43:43.803 --> 01:43:45.184
[SPEAKER_35]: Oh, Angel remembered her last one.

01:43:45.224 --> 01:43:45.424
[SPEAKER_35]: Yes.

01:43:47.265 --> 01:43:52.048
[SPEAKER_07]: I need a dial-up because we still have it and I need to get rid of that soon so I'm going to fix it this week.

01:43:52.348 --> 01:43:53.248
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe I can get high speed.

01:43:53.349 --> 01:43:53.629
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay.

01:43:54.609 --> 01:43:55.049
[SPEAKER_35]: There we go.

01:43:57.771 --> 01:43:59.512
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright, that's it for the FUs of the week.

01:44:02.734 --> 01:44:03.054
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright.

01:44:03.774 --> 01:44:03.834
[SPEAKER_35]: Um...

01:44:05.690 --> 01:44:09.834
[SPEAKER_35]: I want to talk about Karaoke Revolution, those big announcements that came out this week.

01:44:09.894 --> 01:44:11.976
[SPEAKER_35]: However, we're opening it up.

01:44:12.457 --> 01:44:15.359
[SPEAKER_35]: Send me a private message if you have a song guess.

01:44:15.439 --> 01:44:16.841
[SPEAKER_35]: We've given you three clues now.

01:44:17.201 --> 01:44:21.725
[SPEAKER_35]: If you have a guess as to what the new Ultramix 2 song is, send it in over a private message.

01:44:21.745 --> 01:44:24.908
[SPEAKER_35]: And if you're the first one to get it right, you get to announce it to everybody.

01:44:25.492 --> 01:44:25.772
[SPEAKER_35]: What?

01:44:25.792 --> 01:44:25.912
[SPEAKER_35]: What?

01:44:49.032 --> 01:44:52.654
[SPEAKER_35]: You know what, I had to cut and trim some of the FUs tonight, so, sorry.

01:44:53.555 --> 01:44:55.236
[SPEAKER_35]: Plus, some folks got them in late, so sorry.

01:44:57.378 --> 01:45:03.202
[SPEAKER_35]: Games Are Fun is a website that's reporting that Konami is releasing two new Karaoke Revolution titles.

01:45:03.622 --> 01:45:10.027
[SPEAKER_35]: Karaoke Revolution Volume 3 for the PlayStation 2, and Karaoke Revolution for the Xbox.

01:45:10.942 --> 01:45:24.372
[SPEAKER_35]: Karaoke Revolution Volume 3 will feature an all-new song list, whereas Karaoke Revolution for the Xbox will mirror the first release on PlayStation 2, with the exception of a handful of new exclusive songs, as well as Xbox Live support.

01:45:25.533 --> 01:45:29.136
[SPEAKER_09]: So people can listen to how bad you sing on Xbox Live.

01:45:29.236 --> 01:45:31.458
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm very interested in that.

01:45:32.338 --> 01:45:34.360
[SPEAKER_35]: That's going to be very interesting.

01:45:34.380 --> 01:45:35.841
[SPEAKER_09]: I might have to do that, and I hate singing.

01:45:42.012 --> 01:45:44.574
[SPEAKER_30]: It's been yet another week and we still don't have the game!

01:45:44.595 --> 01:45:45.175
[SPEAKER_30]: Woohoo!

01:45:48.978 --> 01:45:49.319
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright.

01:45:52.446 --> 01:45:55.308
[SPEAKER_35]: Okay, let's see, moving on.

01:45:58.189 --> 01:46:00.471
[SPEAKER_35]: Okay, here's the song list for Karaoke Revolution Volume 3.

01:46:00.871 --> 01:46:01.351
[SPEAKER_35]: Here they are.

01:46:02.112 --> 01:46:16.199

[SPEAKER_35]: Take My Breath Away, Thank You, The Reason, Twist and Shout, Unchained Melody, Under Pressure, When I'm Gone, Why Can't I, and this will be the Liz Phair song, and You're The One That I Want.

01:46:58.534 --> 01:46:58.954
[SPEAKER_35]: Very interesting.

01:46:58.974 --> 01:46:59.814
[SPEAKER_35]: What do you think about that, Loki?

01:47:01.134 --> 01:47:02.735
[SPEAKER_30]: Dude, that's awesome because you know what?

01:47:03.095 --> 01:47:08.776
[SPEAKER_30]: That means that Don't You Forget About Me could make it into Extreme 2.

01:47:08.836 --> 01:47:09.136
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah.

01:47:12.745 --> 01:47:13.546
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah, that's awesome.

01:47:14.126 --> 01:47:16.529
[SPEAKER_30]: And also, what was it?

01:47:16.549 --> 01:47:19.211
[SPEAKER_30]: You're the one I know that would make Nelly happy.

01:47:19.231 --> 01:47:21.894
[SPEAKER_30]: That's on the first one.

01:47:21.914 --> 01:47:22.034
[SPEAKER_30]: It is?

01:47:22.054 --> 01:47:22.134
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah.

01:47:22.154 --> 01:47:22.814
[SPEAKER_30]: Hey, wait a second.

01:47:22.834 --> 01:47:24.496
[SPEAKER_30]: That is on the first one.

01:47:26.718 --> 01:47:27.359
[SPEAKER_30]: Repeats!

01:47:28.760 --> 01:47:29.481
[SPEAKER_09]: Shenanigans!

01:47:29.861 --> 01:47:31.082
[SPEAKER_09]: I call shenanigans!

01:47:33.324 --> 01:47:36.427
[SPEAKER_09]: Does that mean that the Bimani Police are going to come out and beat Rob with a broom?

01:47:44.891 --> 01:47:46.791
[SPEAKER_35]: What do you think about this Karaoke Revolution Vol.

01:47:47.011 --> 01:47:46.791
3?

01:47:47.291 --> 01:47:49.332
[SPEAKER_35]: The franchise expanding some more, it sounds like.

01:47:49.352 --> 01:47:50.072
[SPEAKER_35]: What do you guys think about this?

01:47:50.512 --> 01:47:52.032
[SPEAKER_09]: I want my Xbox version.

01:47:55.073 --> 01:47:57.493
[SPEAKER_09]: I could really sort of care less about the PS2.

01:47:57.533 --> 01:48:12.576
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, not that I could care less about it, but now that there's going to be an Xbox one, I would rather have it on Xbox than PS2, because PS2 games are overall more of a disappointment than the same game on the Xbox.

01:48:17.566 --> 01:48:18.506
[SPEAKER_09]: I love my Xbox.

01:48:19.646 --> 01:48:20.427
[SPEAKER_09]: My addict box.

01:48:22.827 --> 01:48:24.927
[SPEAKER_30]: I newly acquired Thug today.

01:48:25.627 --> 01:48:26.548
[SPEAKER_30]: I can't wait to play it.

01:48:27.668 --> 01:48:27.968
[SPEAKER_09]: Thug?

01:48:28.468 --> 01:48:29.308
[SPEAKER_30]: Tony Hawk Underground.

01:48:29.428 --> 01:48:29.548
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh!

01:48:30.468 --> 01:48:30.748
[SPEAKER_09]: Cool.

01:48:31.329 --> 01:48:31.749
[SPEAKER_09]: I had that.

01:48:31.969 --> 01:48:33.969
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah, I'm renting it and I'm going to copy it.

01:48:34.289 --> 01:48:35.769
[SPEAKER_30]: Because I am a copier.

01:48:36.429 --> 01:48:37.830
[SPEAKER_09]: I have mine now.

01:48:38.390 --> 01:48:39.770
[SPEAKER_09]: My HD loader.

01:48:40.390 --> 01:48:41.690
[SPEAKER_30]: HD loader fucking rocks.

01:48:41.890 --> 01:48:43.851
[SPEAKER_09]: We have the ESPN football game on it.

01:48:43.871 --> 01:48:44.831
[SPEAKER_09]: Dan's been playing that.

01:48:45.242 --> 01:48:45.722
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah.

01:48:46.383 --> 01:48:53.526
[SPEAKER_30]: See, Driver 3 is awesome, because, you know, I paid five bucks to get it, and that's all it was worth.

01:48:57.688 --> 01:49:03.931
[SPEAKER_35]: And there's no Z. No Z. Can we get Sigurd back in here for the latest clue roundup here, what's going on?

01:49:08.933 --> 01:49:10.494
[SPEAKER_34]: We're doing a show here.

01:49:12.697 --> 01:49:13.058
[SPEAKER_35]: All right.

01:49:13.698 --> 01:49:14.460
[SPEAKER_35]: Hi, everybody.

01:49:14.480 --> 01:49:16.362
[SPEAKER_35]: Are you ready to go through the clues?

01:49:16.943 --> 01:49:17.203
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay.

01:49:17.324 --> 01:49:17.864
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:49:18.746 --> 01:49:18.986
[SPEAKER_35]: All right.

01:49:19.006 --> 01:49:19.346
[SPEAKER_35]: Here we go.

01:49:20.569 --> 01:49:25.172
[SPEAKER_35]: Here we go, let's see, we had Karma Titan submit a guess for Armageddon.

01:49:26.472 --> 01:49:26.792
[SPEAKER_35]: No.

01:49:26.953 --> 01:49:27.213
[SPEAKER_35]: No.

01:49:27.793 --> 01:49:36.438
[SPEAKER_35]: Then we had WhiteRob say Secret Tale from 2DX7Style because of the tattle tales thing, and the fact that each curtain behind Let's Make a Deal had a secret behind it.

01:49:36.478 --> 01:49:37.758
[SPEAKER_35]: That's good reasoning, but no.

01:49:37.858 --> 01:49:38.579
[SPEAKER_35]: It's a very good reasoning.

01:49:38.679 --> 01:49:40.940
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm really, I'm shocked with that reasoning, that was great.

01:49:40.980 --> 01:49:47.744
[SPEAKER_35]: Kabut says my guess on the clues is Paranoia Survivor Max because the sound clip played was really fast like the song in the quote talking about tattling,

01:49:48.084 --> 01:49:51.045
[SPEAKER_35]: So that might mean paranoia and the curtain thing surprising.

01:49:51.445 --> 01:49:51.645
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

01:49:52.045 --> 01:49:52.185
[SPEAKER_35]: No.

01:49:52.965 --> 01:49:53.285
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright.

01:49:54.585 --> 01:49:58.086
[SPEAKER_35]: And then we had MJSI24 say, It's a song called Last Romance.

01:49:58.286 --> 01:50:01.926
[SPEAKER_35]: I typed in Let's Make a Deal and Awesome into Google and that was the first hit.

01:50:02.466 --> 01:50:02.847
[SPEAKER_28]: No.

01:50:03.807 --> 01:50:04.107
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright.

01:50:06.327 --> 01:50:07.087
[SPEAKER_28]: I like that one.

01:50:07.167 --> 01:50:08.107
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm going to suggest that.

01:50:08.347 --> 01:50:10.248
[SPEAKER_28]: And then... Just for the reasoning.

01:50:10.448 --> 01:50:12.228
[SPEAKER_35]: Somebody submitted the correct answer.

01:50:12.568 --> 01:50:13.148
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh my goodness.

01:50:13.168 --> 01:50:17.189
[SPEAKER_35]: So I'm about to call them right here on the air and they're going to announce...

01:50:18.021 --> 01:50:19.322
[SPEAKER_35]: What the song is to everybody.

01:50:19.342 --> 01:50:21.644
[SPEAKER_35]: So I'm hoping they're picking it up because they actually have Skype on their system board.

01:50:21.664 --> 01:50:22.524
[SPEAKER_35]: I seriously can't believe that.

01:50:22.544 --> 01:50:24.366
[SPEAKER_35]: So we're going to see if we can get it here.

01:50:25.086 --> 01:50:27.628
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm hoping he can pick up, otherwise he's going to have to do the chat room thing.

01:50:28.729 --> 01:50:29.149
[SPEAKER_35]: Let's see.

01:50:30.310 --> 01:50:31.270
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm hoping it's going through.

01:50:31.290 --> 01:50:35.353
[SPEAKER_35]: We're trying to get through.

01:50:35.373 --> 01:50:38.536
[SPEAKER_35]: Oh, there he is.

01:50:38.596 --> 01:50:38.956
[SPEAKER_35]: It's ringing.

01:50:42.418 --> 01:50:43.639
[SPEAKER_35]: Hello, is this Jazz?

01:50:44.360 --> 01:50:44.720
[SPEAKER_35]: Hello?

01:50:45.040 --> 01:50:45.761
[SPEAKER_35]: Hello, Jazz?

01:50:46.361 --> 01:50:46.601
[SPEAKER_35]: Hey.

01:50:46.881 --> 01:50:47.322
[SPEAKER_35]: How are you?

01:50:48.049 --> 01:50:48.509
[SPEAKER_37]: Pretty good.

01:50:48.789 --> 01:50:49.089
[SPEAKER_35]: Good.

01:50:49.109 --> 01:50:49.950
[SPEAKER_35]: Hey, guess what?

01:50:49.990 --> 01:50:50.770
[SPEAKER_35]: You got the song.

01:50:50.990 --> 01:50:51.710
[SPEAKER_35]: What's up?

01:50:51.750 --> 01:50:52.150
[SPEAKER_35]: All right.

01:50:52.330 --> 01:50:52.650
[SPEAKER_35]: All right.

01:50:52.770 --> 01:50:57.032
[SPEAKER_35]: But I have to say, two other people got it as well, but you got it first.

01:50:57.052 --> 01:50:57.652
[SPEAKER_35]: You got it first.

01:50:58.372 --> 01:50:59.292
[SPEAKER_35]: Who are the runner-ups?

01:50:59.612 --> 01:51:00.993
[SPEAKER_35]: All right, quick, tell us what it is.

01:51:02.393 --> 01:51:04.274
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called Tittle Tattle by Zonk.

01:51:04.374 --> 01:51:05.174
[SPEAKER_35]: That is correct.

01:51:05.214 --> 01:51:05.494
[SPEAKER_35]: That's correct.

01:51:05.514 --> 01:51:07.975
[SPEAKER_35]: The new song is Tittle Tattle by Zonk.

01:51:08.015 --> 01:51:09.435
[SPEAKER_35]: And what was the reasoning behind that?

01:51:10.336 --> 01:51:17.918
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I looked it up on Google, and I found that the Losing Things and Let's Make a Deal are called Zonks.

01:51:18.240 --> 01:51:18.781
[SPEAKER_35]: Tittle Tattle

01:51:37.384 --> 01:51:39.565
[SPEAKER_35]: and then the tattle bit and a zonk.

01:51:39.866 --> 01:51:46.850
[SPEAKER_35]: So ApolloChan had that right as well, and Enigma also had it right, saying one, tattle, and then two, the tapping in the song and the name of the band.

01:51:46.870 --> 01:51:51.994
[SPEAKER_35]: So ApolloChan had the 100% correct reasoning why, what we were doing, but Jazz, you still got it first.

01:51:52.314 --> 01:51:53.134
[SPEAKER_35]: Congratulations.

01:51:54.855 --> 01:51:55.216
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

01:51:55.356 --> 01:51:55.916
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you feel?

01:51:56.176 --> 01:51:56.737
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you feel?

01:51:57.617 --> 01:51:58.758
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanna go to Disneyland.

01:51:58.838 --> 01:51:59.418
[SPEAKER_35]: Good job.

01:51:59.678 --> 01:52:01.119
[SPEAKER_35]: You're the smart kid tonight.

01:52:01.680 --> 01:52:02.060
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.

01:52:02.300 --> 01:52:02.660
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

01:52:02.780 --> 01:52:04.642
[SPEAKER_35]: Hey, hey, hey, did you beat Doom 3?

01:52:05.979 --> 01:52:08.901
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm waiting for someone to come over because I'm scared.

01:52:11.122 --> 01:52:13.664
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright, thanks for calling us, Jazz, and congratulations to you.

01:52:14.384 --> 01:52:14.844
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

01:52:15.045 --> 01:52:16.405
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright, have a good one.

01:52:16.966 --> 01:52:17.866
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright, see, that was cool.

01:52:17.906 --> 01:52:18.787
[SPEAKER_35]: I like the Skype thing.

01:52:18.807 --> 01:52:19.327
[SPEAKER_35]: That was great.

01:52:19.747 --> 01:52:21.869
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright, here it is, guys.

01:52:21.889 --> 01:52:23.069
[SPEAKER_35]: We're going to play the song for you.

01:52:23.129 --> 01:52:28.052
[SPEAKER_35]: Again, as announced by the clues, this was Tiddle was the name of the sound file.

01:52:29.313 --> 01:52:30.374
[SPEAKER_35]: And, of course, there was the...

01:52:31.272 --> 01:52:32.873
[SPEAKER_35]: Mama don't like tattletales.

01:52:33.133 --> 01:52:37.556
[SPEAKER_35]: The tails and then the let's make a deal was a zonk when you lost.

01:52:37.936 --> 01:52:43.039
[SPEAKER_35]: So the song is Tittle Tattle and the artist is Zonk.

01:52:43.059 --> 01:52:44.880
[SPEAKER_35]: And we're going to play it for you right now.

01:52:44.920 --> 01:52:47.802
[SPEAKER_35]: And I got to say, this is a very interesting song.

01:52:47.822 --> 01:52:53.225
[SPEAKER_35]: It is not a typical kind of thing I would think about when I think about DDR.

01:52:55.907 --> 01:52:57.888
[SPEAKER_35]: So here it is.

01:52:58.433 --> 01:52:59.376
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm queuing it up here.

01:52:59.476 --> 01:53:03.206
[SPEAKER_35]: The artist is Zonk, and the song is called Tittle Tattle.

01:53:03.587 --> 01:53:03.828
[SPEAKER_03]: Enjoy.

01:53:27.631 --> 01:53:28.816
Thanks for watching!

01:54:15.753 --> 01:54:17.677
and yet nobody knows.

01:54:18.118 --> 01:54:22.910
Sanitizing, hallucinations, window licking the imagination.

01:54:45.149 --> 01:54:46.390
Thanks for watching!

01:55:31.893 --> 01:55:33.478
Thank you for watching!

01:56:08.520 --> 01:56:11.849
The Cadence Ladder is a synchronous symphony Tittle, tattle, shake, shake

01:56:19.372 --> 01:56:20.153
and many more.

01:56:55.351 --> 01:57:01.212
[SPEAKER_35]: A new song on Ultramix 2 as revealed by Jazz, who correctly guessed the clues earlier.

01:57:01.292 --> 01:57:03.453
[SPEAKER_35]: That was Zonk with Tittle Tattle.

01:57:03.493 --> 01:57:04.113
[SPEAKER_35]: What did you guys think of that?

01:57:04.133 --> 01:57:05.533
[SPEAKER_35]: It was the first listen for all of us here.

01:57:05.553 --> 01:57:06.013
[SPEAKER_35]: What did you think?

01:57:06.553 --> 01:57:07.333
[SPEAKER_09]: I liked that song.

01:57:07.474 --> 01:57:08.914
[SPEAKER_09]: That song was cool.

01:57:09.074 --> 01:57:09.894
[SPEAKER_09]: It was swingy.

01:57:10.474 --> 01:57:12.995
[SPEAKER_35]: That was unlike a lot of other DDR songs.

01:57:13.015 --> 01:57:16.155
[SPEAKER_35]: I mean, you could say it's kind of like an athletic song that's really stretching it.

01:57:16.335 --> 01:57:17.196
[SPEAKER_35]: Really, really stretching it.

01:57:17.616 --> 01:57:19.276
[SPEAKER_35]: I think it's very original.

01:57:19.356 --> 01:57:20.736
[SPEAKER_35]: I think it's a great ad for DDR.

01:57:22.377 --> 01:57:22.797
[SPEAKER_35]: Lanky style.

01:57:23.137 --> 01:57:23.557
[SPEAKER_29]: Interesting.

01:57:24.337 --> 01:57:24.417
[SPEAKER_29]: It

01:57:25.185 --> 01:57:25.405
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah.

01:57:26.286 --> 01:57:26.926
[SPEAKER_35]: Just interesting?

01:57:27.087 --> 01:57:29.709
[SPEAKER_29]: It just, the music production on it is just strange.

01:57:29.929 --> 01:57:33.031
[SPEAKER_29]: Which is good, because that's kind of the way, you know, Konami Originals are.

01:57:33.432 --> 01:57:33.752
[SPEAKER_29]: Strange.

01:57:34.032 --> 01:57:34.853
[SPEAKER_29]: So, hey, cool.

01:57:35.093 --> 01:57:39.957
[SPEAKER_35]: Now, um, I'm sorry, I just want to add, this is not a long version.

01:57:40.077 --> 01:57:43.280
[SPEAKER_35]: We just happen to only have the full cut of the song, not the edit.

01:57:43.640 --> 01:57:46.643
[SPEAKER_35]: So, long versions are not coming back to Ultramix 2, as far as we know.

01:57:47.383 --> 01:57:49.325
[SPEAKER_28]: Um, let me put that in, in...

01:57:49.705 --> 01:57:51.806
[SPEAKER_28]: Better words, they're not coming back at all.

01:57:52.066 --> 01:57:52.386
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

01:57:53.226 --> 01:57:56.227
[SPEAKER_28]: So if you're pining for a long version, go play Fifth Mix.

01:57:56.507 --> 01:57:56.827
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright.

01:57:57.347 --> 01:57:58.447
[SPEAKER_35]: Well, thank you for clearing that up.

01:57:58.807 --> 01:58:00.428
[SPEAKER_35]: I didn't know if you could say one way or the other.

01:58:00.448 --> 01:58:02.448
[SPEAKER_35]: But, okay, there you have it.

01:58:02.548 --> 01:58:13.471
[SPEAKER_28]: Also, people that listen to that song, if you think it's kind of odd sounding and doesn't really fit DDR or something, Ultramix 2 has a completely new direction than what you'd see on the PS2 releases.

01:58:14.071 --> 01:58:14.411
[SPEAKER_28]: So...

01:58:15.629 --> 01:58:19.973
[SPEAKER_28]: What do you guys think of that song, the rest of you guys?

01:58:20.614 --> 01:58:21.815
[SPEAKER_35]: I thought it was so cool.

01:58:21.835 --> 01:58:22.436
[SPEAKER_35]: Angel, don't trip.

01:58:37.916 --> 01:58:39.037
[SPEAKER_07]: I really liked that.

01:58:39.077 --> 01:58:40.118
[SPEAKER_07]: That was really neat.

01:58:40.258 --> 01:58:42.379
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't even, like, compare it to anything else.

01:58:43.040 --> 01:58:43.861
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I really can't.

01:58:44.941 --> 01:58:50.646
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it's the fact that I haven't really been playing DDR that long, but I really liked it.

01:58:50.666 --> 01:58:53.488
[SPEAKER_07]: It was really dancey and jumpy and, yeah.

01:58:54.989 --> 01:58:57.831
[SPEAKER_35]: Question for Sigurd, is the tap dancing part staying in?

01:58:59.592 --> 01:58:59.973
[SPEAKER_35]: I don't know.

01:59:00.053 --> 01:59:01.034
[SPEAKER_35]: That's what somebody asked me.

01:59:01.594 --> 01:59:02.875
[SPEAKER_35]: He doesn't even know what the hell that means.

01:59:06.455 --> 01:59:19.693
[SPEAKER_28]: I have no clue what you're talking about, but for the most part, the long version of the song is, if you could just cut it in half, you keep all the music styles in it and all the singing, that's what you've got.

01:59:19.834 --> 01:59:22.918
[SPEAKER_28]: Think of it as a long version or doubled over from what you just heard.

01:59:23.504 --> 01:59:28.930
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm going to be brave and open up the Skype line for feedback on that song or Ultramix 2 in general.

01:59:30.271 --> 01:59:32.093
[SPEAKER_35]: So you can give us a call on the Skype line.

01:59:32.133 --> 01:59:37.739
[SPEAKER_35]: If you don't know how to call us on the Skype line, head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.org and click on Interact With Us.

01:59:37.819 --> 01:59:39.241
[SPEAKER_35]: It's a brand new section on our website.

01:59:39.361 --> 01:59:39.922
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you, Jason.

01:59:40.522 --> 01:59:44.503
[SPEAKER_35]: and it talks about how you could call the show if you want.

01:59:45.163 --> 01:59:52.026
[SPEAKER_35]: So please do give us a call on the Skype line if you have a comment on the song or, you know, Ultramix 2 in general.

01:59:52.466 --> 01:59:56.427
[SPEAKER_35]: And after we field a couple calls, we're going to do Ask Orange Lounge in a little bit.

01:59:57.427 --> 02:00:03.469
[SPEAKER_35]: We haven't done that for a few weeks now, so we definitely want to let you guys ask a question of any host here, or certainly Sigurd.

02:00:03.529 --> 02:00:06.430
[SPEAKER_35]: However, there will be a rule to tonight's Ask Orange Lounge.

02:00:06.790 --> 02:00:10.411
[SPEAKER_35]: You may not ask Sigurd anything about Ultramix 2 or DDR Extreme.

02:00:10.811 --> 02:00:18.553
[SPEAKER_35]: You can ask him about his sex life, you can ask him about his living... But you cannot ask him anything about Ultramix 2 or Extreme.

02:00:18.673 --> 02:00:20.114
[SPEAKER_35]: That's the rule for Ask Orange Lounge tonight.

02:00:21.014 --> 02:00:22.836
[SPEAKER_28]: The new DDR will feature ARROWS!

02:00:46.206 --> 02:00:49.989
[SPEAKER_35]: We're not getting any calls, so I guess nobody has any feedback on that.

02:00:50.009 --> 02:00:53.392
[SPEAKER_35]: The Skype thing is still new, also, as well.

02:00:53.532 --> 02:01:00.218
[SPEAKER_28]: A couple weeks back I was on here and I said that, you know, the new song, or one of the new songs has up arrows.

02:01:00.778 --> 02:01:07.824
[SPEAKER_28]: Do you know how, like, bad that sent the DDR Extreme US forum into, like, crazy shambles?

02:01:07.884 --> 02:01:11.327
[SPEAKER_28]: They thought, like, oh, it has up arrows, let's look for songs that have up arrows!

02:01:11.937 --> 02:01:14.079
[SPEAKER_28]: And it was the funniest thing ever.

02:01:15.359 --> 02:01:17.401
[SPEAKER_28]: I should say there's ones with left arrows this time.

02:01:17.741 --> 02:01:18.341
[SPEAKER_28]: See what happens.

02:01:19.502 --> 02:01:23.605
[SPEAKER_35]: Okay, nobody's calling on the Skype line, so I guess we'll close it and we'll open it back up later during Ask Orange Lounge.

02:01:23.625 --> 02:01:29.709
[SPEAKER_35]: However, again, you cannot ask him about Ultramix 2 or Extreme.

02:01:29.969 --> 02:01:32.971
[SPEAKER_35]: If you do, one of us will answer the question, who knows nothing about the game.

02:01:33.432 --> 02:01:36.534
[SPEAKER_35]: And the reason for that is the three-letter word called the...

02:01:37.575 --> 02:01:39.556
[SPEAKER_35]: NDA ABC Oh no problem

02:02:00.795 --> 02:02:03.958
[SPEAKER_35]: Maybe you'll come back after the games are released and give us some more information.

02:02:03.998 --> 02:02:04.898
[SPEAKER_35]: Yeah, I could probably do that.

02:02:04.998 --> 02:02:05.379
[SPEAKER_35]: Definitely.

02:02:05.439 --> 02:02:06.860
[SPEAKER_35]: So thank you, certainly.

02:02:06.880 --> 02:02:08.921
[SPEAKER_35]: But I know you're going to be busy the next couple months.

02:02:09.542 --> 02:02:09.782
[SPEAKER_35]: All right.

02:02:11.283 --> 02:02:12.064
[SPEAKER_35]: Let's do a break.

02:02:12.604 --> 02:02:16.187
[SPEAKER_35]: And then we'll come back and we'll do some Ask Orange Lounge since Skype people didn't want to call.

02:02:16.567 --> 02:02:17.068
[SPEAKER_35]: I see how it is.

02:02:17.088 --> 02:02:18.669
[SPEAKER_35]: What do you guys want to hear this break?

02:02:18.749 --> 02:02:19.890
[SPEAKER_35]: Sigurd, what do you want to hear this break?

02:02:19.930 --> 02:02:20.730
[SPEAKER_35]: I'll let you pick a song.

02:02:20.750 --> 02:02:22.872
[SPEAKER_35]: If I have it available, I hope.

02:02:24.915 --> 02:02:26.255
[SPEAKER_35]: Do you have any athletic songs?

02:02:26.315 --> 02:02:27.776
[SPEAKER_35]: Do I have any athletic songs?

02:02:27.836 --> 02:02:28.536
[SPEAKER_35]: Of course I do.

02:02:28.616 --> 02:02:29.997
[SPEAKER_35]: How about War Game from 8Style?

02:02:30.938 --> 02:02:31.558
[SPEAKER_35]: Yeah, Hit and Slap.

02:02:31.578 --> 02:02:32.478
[SPEAKER_35]: I want to hear Hit and Slap.

02:02:32.498 --> 02:02:34.179
[SPEAKER_35]: I don't know if I have Hit and Slap available.

02:02:34.199 --> 02:02:34.899
[SPEAKER_35]: I'll try and find it.

02:02:36.340 --> 02:02:37.081
[SPEAKER_35]: Firedub.

02:02:37.121 --> 02:02:38.381
[SPEAKER_35]: I think I have Firedub.

02:02:38.601 --> 02:02:40.942
[SPEAKER_35]: I will try and find Firedub for you.

02:02:41.003 --> 02:02:43.884
[SPEAKER_35]: Disco Dog, because Jamie wants to hear it, which is also athletics.

02:02:44.164 --> 02:02:45.505
[SPEAKER_35]: So we'll just make it an athletics break.

02:02:46.785 --> 02:02:49.026
[SPEAKER_35]: We'll be back with some Ask Orange Lounge.

02:02:50.007 --> 02:02:51.408
[SPEAKER_35]: Start submitting your questions now.

02:02:51.488 --> 02:02:51.908
[SPEAKER_35]: We'll be back.

02:02:55.332 --> 02:02:56.173
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for watching!

02:03:36.301 --> 02:03:36.762
DarkSakura.com

02:04:18.604 --> 02:04:19.424
Thanks for watching!

02:04:56.733 --> 02:04:57.454
[SPEAKER_35]: New music.

02:04:57.754 --> 02:05:04.862
[SPEAKER_35]: Okay, the only way I have this song is with the new music thing over it, because we added it back when it was still new, but just ignore the new music part.

02:05:04.982 --> 02:05:05.563
[SPEAKER_32]: It's new!

02:05:05.943 --> 02:05:07.945
[SPEAKER_32]: On Orange Lounge Radio.

02:05:08.246 --> 02:05:11.629
[SPEAKER_32]: This song's in the newest downloadable pack for DDR Ultramix.

02:05:12.050 --> 02:05:14.012
[SPEAKER_32]: This is Athletics with Firedub.

02:06:06.218 --> 02:06:23.305
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't want no ice cream love, girl kids I don't want no ice cream love, girl kids I don't want no ice cream love, girl kids I don't want no ice cream love, girl kids I don't want no ice cream love, girl kids I don't want no ice cream love, girl kids I don't want no ice cream love, girl kids I don't want no ice cream love, girl kids

02:06:45.339 --> 02:06:47.061
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks for watching!

02:07:07.785 --> 02:07:08.808
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks for watching!

02:07:50.126 --> 02:07:55.788
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Random Person on the Street, who by the way is not an actor, what do you think of the Orange Lounge mainlining music in Moore's show?

02:07:56.088 --> 02:08:03.250
[SPEAKER_39]: The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.

02:08:03.570 --> 02:08:05.551
[SPEAKER_39]: It's unearthly.

02:08:05.791 --> 02:08:09.532
[SPEAKER_39]: It's like being in a club, except you don't have to actually ask someone to dance.

02:08:10.012 --> 02:08:12.493
[SPEAKER_35]: We are back with Orange Lounge Radio.

02:08:13.294 --> 02:08:19.758
[SPEAKER_35]: and what we're going to do now is we're going to get into the Ask Orange Lounge section of the show.

02:08:20.338 --> 02:08:26.001
[SPEAKER_35]: It's been like three weeks since we've done this, so I know you guys probably have a lot of good questions to ask tonight.

02:08:26.081 --> 02:08:31.104
[SPEAKER_35]: And we will open up Skype even for the questions or feedback in general on the show because we're winding down.

02:08:31.824 --> 02:08:33.385
[SPEAKER_28]: If anybody wants to use Skype.

02:08:34.325 --> 02:08:35.106
[SPEAKER_35]: I think some people do.

02:08:35.146 --> 02:08:38.608
[SPEAKER_35]: We got added by a couple people during the break there, so I think some people are learning how to use it.

02:08:39.028 --> 02:08:39.688
[SPEAKER_35]: So that's cool.

02:08:40.689 --> 02:08:40.929
[SPEAKER_35]: Okay.

02:08:42.406 --> 02:08:46.049
[SPEAKER_31]: Here we go guys with Ask Orange Lounge.

02:08:52.974 --> 02:08:54.215
[SPEAKER_35]: Let's Ask Orange Lounge.

02:08:54.795 --> 02:08:55.896
[SPEAKER_35]: Some stupid question.

02:08:56.417 --> 02:08:59.659
[SPEAKER_35]: What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

02:09:00.120 --> 02:09:01.801
[SPEAKER_35]: But I think this week will be interesting.

02:09:02.161 --> 02:09:03.302
[SPEAKER_35]: Do you want to know why?

02:09:03.782 --> 02:09:08.986
[SPEAKER_35]: Because whenever secret comes, the rest of us don't get any attention.

02:09:10.507 --> 02:09:10.888
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright.

02:09:13.835 --> 02:09:18.621
[SPEAKER_35]: I remember when you were on this show a year ago and nobody cared.

02:09:18.641 --> 02:09:21.003
[SPEAKER_28]: It's because I didn't have insider information.

02:09:21.064 --> 02:09:22.045
[SPEAKER_35]: Yeah, you didn't work for Gnomey.

02:09:24.223 --> 02:09:26.305
[SPEAKER_35]: I remember you were here for our Max 2 premiere, shall we?

02:09:26.325 --> 02:09:27.166
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, I was there for that.

02:09:27.186 --> 02:09:30.989
[SPEAKER_35]: We were first playing Max 2, and who would have thought that you would have gotten to see the next one before everyone else?

02:09:31.009 --> 02:09:33.211
[SPEAKER_35]: It's probably because I like Forever Sunshine so much.

02:09:33.972 --> 02:09:36.034
[SPEAKER_35]: All right, let's get to the questions, shall we?

02:09:37.015 --> 02:09:41.518
[SPEAKER_35]: Starting it off with a question from... Let's see, we got that one.

02:09:41.859 --> 02:09:42.980
[SPEAKER_35]: I know John Fields had a question.

02:09:43.280 --> 02:09:45.042
[SPEAKER_35]: Oh, yeah, I'm sure you're going to want to answer this, Sigurd.

02:09:45.442 --> 02:09:46.002
[SPEAKER_35]: Question to you.

02:09:46.903 --> 02:09:48.805
[SPEAKER_35]: How much money do you make at Konami per year?

02:09:50.874 --> 02:09:52.916
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, I make a dollar per year.

02:09:56.780 --> 02:10:04.008
[SPEAKER_35]: I know, yeah, we... Well, you know, maybe somebody's interested in getting into the profession, but I believe there are contracts that you sign that say you can't disclose what you make, right?

02:10:04.028 --> 02:10:06.591
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, well, I think that's the same way with every job, pretty much.

02:10:06.651 --> 02:10:12.798
[SPEAKER_28]: Unless you're, like, trying to get somebody hired on, then you offer them, you know, this is how much you'll make a year, this is how much you'll make an hour, or whatever, but...

02:10:13.643 --> 02:10:21.424
[SPEAKER_28]: It's like either an unwritten rule or a written rule that you don't discuss your earnings at work or of your work.

02:10:22.083 --> 02:10:24.385
[SPEAKER_35]: Just keep imagining he's filthy, stinky rich.

02:10:24.405 --> 02:10:25.846
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, I'm rich.

02:10:26.946 --> 02:10:27.927
[SPEAKER_28]: With poorness.

02:10:28.988 --> 02:10:32.710
[SPEAKER_35]: MJSI24, I have no idea a quick way to pronounce that name.

02:10:32.770 --> 02:10:36.713
[SPEAKER_35]: How long has Sigurd been working at Konami, and how did he get his job?

02:10:38.014 --> 02:10:39.675
[SPEAKER_35]: Hoping this does not violate the NDA.

02:10:39.755 --> 02:10:44.138
[SPEAKER_35]: So whatever you can say that doesn't violate the NDA, although I believe you addressed this two weeks ago when you were here.

02:10:44.668 --> 02:10:46.070
[SPEAKER_28]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

02:11:01.420 --> 02:11:02.461
[SPEAKER_28]: Just look on their website.

02:11:02.501 --> 02:11:06.705
[SPEAKER_28]: They don't always have openings, but if they have an opening, they will post it.

02:11:07.346 --> 02:11:08.607
[SPEAKER_28]: Just check it out there.

02:11:08.667 --> 02:11:11.329
[SPEAKER_35]: I opened up the Skype line if anybody wants to contact us there.

02:11:11.389 --> 02:11:19.096
[SPEAKER_35]: Remember, please do not call when the Do Not Disturb light is on because that means we're either on another call or we're doing something else during the show and we're not taking your call.

02:11:19.977 --> 02:11:22.439
[SPEAKER_35]: We do have a couple questions over here.

02:11:24.721 --> 02:11:29.765
[SPEAKER_35]: Karma Titan says, I heard DDR Extreme was the last mix from the DDR series from DDRmaniacs.net.

02:11:29.785 --> 02:11:30.346
[SPEAKER_35]: True or false?

02:11:30.486 --> 02:11:31.647
[SPEAKER_35]: Actually, I'll answer this one.

02:11:32.467 --> 02:11:33.708
[SPEAKER_35]: I'll go ahead and answer this question.

02:11:34.549 --> 02:11:38.552
[SPEAKER_35]: It is absolutely... Don't believe anything that you read on that site, right?

02:11:40.313 --> 02:11:40.754
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm just kidding.

02:11:40.854 --> 02:11:44.396
[SPEAKER_35]: Do you want to try this one?

02:11:44.557 --> 02:11:45.457
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, I can do this one.

02:11:46.638 --> 02:11:49.100
[SPEAKER_28]: Don't listen to internet rumors or anything like that.

02:11:49.700 --> 02:11:52.963
[SPEAKER_28]: If there is going to be another one, just check Konami's site.

02:11:54.578 --> 02:11:56.699
[SPEAKER_28]: or Orange Lounge Radio.

02:11:57.079 --> 02:12:01.222
[SPEAKER_30]: This is from a site that just announced, hey, DDR Festival Mix is coming out.

02:12:02.742 --> 02:12:03.503
[SPEAKER_30]: Um, wait a second.

02:12:03.583 --> 02:12:04.083
[SPEAKER_30]: No, no, no.

02:12:04.103 --> 02:12:05.624
[SPEAKER_30]: Konami USA.

02:12:05.664 --> 02:12:06.504
[SPEAKER_28]: Not Japan.

02:12:06.544 --> 02:12:07.245
[SPEAKER_30]: Japan's weird.

02:12:07.685 --> 02:12:09.886
[SPEAKER_30]: Oh, yeah, because they're making money now.

02:12:10.066 --> 02:12:12.067
[SPEAKER_30]: Oh, stop, stop.

02:12:12.367 --> 02:12:13.328
[SPEAKER_35]: Where are they, Nickelodeon?

02:12:13.528 --> 02:12:14.889
[SPEAKER_35]: Let me answer the call we just took.

02:12:14.929 --> 02:12:16.129
[SPEAKER_35]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:12:17.030 --> 02:12:19.551
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, um... Excuse me.

02:12:21.832 --> 02:12:22.553
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, um...

02:12:24.383 --> 02:12:25.284
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you laughing at me?

02:12:25.744 --> 02:12:26.465
[SPEAKER_35]: Yes, I am.

02:12:26.665 --> 02:12:27.285
[SPEAKER_35]: No, I'm just teasing.

02:12:27.325 --> 02:12:27.626
[SPEAKER_35]: What's up?

02:12:29.948 --> 02:12:31.008
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, why'd you ban me?

02:12:32.450 --> 02:12:33.470
[SPEAKER_35]: Oh, oh.

02:12:33.891 --> 02:12:35.953
[SPEAKER_35]: It's people that can't get over themselves.

02:12:36.593 --> 02:12:36.813
[SPEAKER_35]: Oh.

02:12:40.636 --> 02:12:41.317
[SPEAKER_35]: Oh, God.

02:12:44.039 --> 02:12:49.083
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to make one comment, and one comment only, although it might be a little bit at length.

02:12:50.404 --> 02:12:51.005
[SPEAKER_09]: Get over it!

02:12:51.625 --> 02:12:52.146
[SPEAKER_09]: You suck!

02:12:54.124 --> 02:12:54.865
[SPEAKER_09]: Get a real life!

02:12:55.145 --> 02:12:57.867
[SPEAKER_09]: Nobody cares about your little drama, so get over it!

02:12:59.789 --> 02:13:01.350
[SPEAKER_09]: That has been a public service announcement.

02:13:01.610 --> 02:13:03.272
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm sorry, wait a minute, I'm sorry, let me turn it one more time.

02:13:06.575 --> 02:13:15.923
[SPEAKER_09]: You must be really bored, have no life and no friends, if you're obsessing over being banned a year and a half ago!

02:13:18.084 --> 02:13:18.665
[SPEAKER_09]: Get over it!

02:13:21.076 --> 02:13:22.440
[SPEAKER_09]: Go bug somebody else.

02:13:22.540 --> 02:13:26.188
[SPEAKER_09]: Aren't you like a moderator on some unknown crappy Bimani site somewhere?

02:13:26.248 --> 02:13:30.177
[SPEAKER_35]: Actually, not quite an unknown site, but yeah.

02:13:30.589 --> 02:13:36.011
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, if you have to have something to validate yourself, why not try the internet like everybody else does?

02:13:36.231 --> 02:13:39.351
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright, that 60 seconds spent too much on that topic.

02:13:39.411 --> 02:13:40.052
[SPEAKER_35]: Let's move on.

02:13:40.112 --> 02:13:43.153
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm going to reopen our newly filtered Skype line.

02:13:46.493 --> 02:13:49.694
[SPEAKER_35]: And see if anybody else who we care about has a question to ask.

02:13:50.795 --> 02:13:52.455
[SPEAKER_35]: Oh, Panda has a question for Loki, though.

02:13:53.495 --> 02:13:55.576
[SPEAKER_35]: Loki, do we have an update on your portal?

02:13:58.126 --> 02:13:58.766
[SPEAKER_30]: Shut up!

02:13:59.587 --> 02:14:00.727
[SPEAKER_30]: I told you, I got the germanium.

02:14:01.128 --> 02:14:09.251
[SPEAKER_30]: So I just need the... I just need, uh, magnet wire and... some, like, miscellaneous copper and crap.

02:14:09.832 --> 02:14:11.413
[SPEAKER_30]: It's just mainly, it's just magnet wire.

02:14:11.733 --> 02:14:12.753
[SPEAKER_30]: That's pretty much all that's left.

02:14:13.053 --> 02:14:13.794
[SPEAKER_19]: And dead people.

02:14:14.674 --> 02:14:15.134
[SPEAKER_30]: Now and now.

02:14:15.595 --> 02:14:17.135
[SPEAKER_30]: Next week will be interesting.

02:14:17.195 --> 02:14:18.396
[SPEAKER_30]: Let me just put it that way.

02:14:19.276 --> 02:14:21.357
[SPEAKER_30]: Next week will be very interesting.

02:14:24.039 --> 02:14:24.299
[SPEAKER_30]: Anyways.

02:14:25.019 --> 02:14:25.759
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah.

02:14:25.780 --> 02:14:26.640
[SPEAKER_09]: He's gonna summon Jesus.

02:14:28.109 --> 02:14:29.430
[SPEAKER_30]: You can't summon Jesus!

02:14:30.150 --> 02:14:31.211
[SPEAKER_30]: That's a pretty cool trick, though.

02:14:33.092 --> 02:14:35.034
[SPEAKER_30]: Next week will be interesting.

02:14:35.254 --> 02:14:36.575
[SPEAKER_30]: That's all I have to say.

02:14:38.656 --> 02:14:43.580
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright, let's take another call and hopefully this... Turn down your Winamp!

02:14:44.120 --> 02:14:47.362
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright.

02:14:48.103 --> 02:14:48.663
[SPEAKER_35]: Who is this?

02:14:49.124 --> 02:14:49.724
[SPEAKER_35]: Turn down the Winamp!

02:14:50.400 --> 02:14:53.682
[SPEAKER_35]: I guess this is for Sigurd Does Konami read their message boards?

02:15:17.470 --> 02:15:22.312
[SPEAKER_30]: Um, no, of course not, because, you know, um, they're not, like, on DDR Freak or anything.

02:15:22.592 --> 02:15:23.092
[SPEAKER_30]: No.

02:15:24.833 --> 02:15:29.475
[SPEAKER_35]: Uh, really quick, um, really quickly.

02:15:29.575 --> 02:15:30.875
[SPEAKER_35]: Hold on, caller, we'll get to you in a minute.

02:15:32.236 --> 02:15:40.299
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, um, yeah, they read their message boards, obviously, because, like, like Loki said, duh, pretty much.

02:15:41.099 --> 02:15:43.660
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright, caller, uh, hi, welcome to Orange Zones Radio, what's up?

02:15:44.389 --> 02:16:01.078
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, on DDR Maniacs, I also heard that the artist Naoki from the DDR series, what is it, I heard that everyone, all the artists like Revan G or Omega and all that, are Naoki.

02:16:01.098 --> 02:16:03.439
[SPEAKER_00]: So are they all the same, true or false?

02:16:04.820 --> 02:16:12.824
[SPEAKER_35]: Well, if you'll pick up a copy of DDR Max and read that instruction manual, you can see all of Naoki's handles, and there's about 20 of them, at least.

02:16:15.677 --> 02:16:15.977
[SPEAKER_35]: Okay?

02:16:19.539 --> 02:16:19.820
[SPEAKER_35]: Okay.

02:16:20.440 --> 02:16:21.741
[SPEAKER_35]: I guess that was a nod of acceptance.

02:16:21.781 --> 02:16:22.101
[SPEAKER_35]: I don't know.

02:16:22.161 --> 02:16:22.861
[SPEAKER_35]: Thanks for the call!

02:16:24.502 --> 02:16:24.843
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright.

02:16:25.643 --> 02:16:27.344
[SPEAKER_30]: He was listening to his radio.

02:16:28.024 --> 02:16:32.447
[SPEAKER_30]: First rule in radio, never listen to your radio on the phone call.

02:16:32.507 --> 02:16:33.728
[SPEAKER_35]: He said it wouldn't work otherwise.

02:16:33.788 --> 02:16:34.108
[SPEAKER_35]: I don't know.

02:16:34.368 --> 02:16:35.249
[SPEAKER_30]: That's stupid.

02:16:35.749 --> 02:16:36.129
[SPEAKER_35]: I don't know.

02:16:36.209 --> 02:16:36.630
[SPEAKER_35]: We'll see.

02:16:37.410 --> 02:16:41.152
[SPEAKER_30]: He probably had one of those non-duplex sound cards.

02:16:41.393 --> 02:16:43.174
[SPEAKER_30]: Oh, you know what?

02:16:43.194 --> 02:16:43.654
[SPEAKER_30]: That might do it.

02:16:43.694 --> 02:16:43.974
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't know.

02:16:49.193 --> 02:16:49.553
[SPEAKER_35]: All right.

02:16:49.853 --> 02:16:50.974
[SPEAKER_35]: No, I'm talking about Moto.

02:16:50.994 --> 02:16:52.674
[SPEAKER_35]: Nygma had another question I want to get to.

02:16:53.535 --> 02:16:57.576
[SPEAKER_35]: Are any of you or people you know going to the tournament in New York in October?

02:16:57.696 --> 02:17:01.877
[SPEAKER_35]: Well, seeing as we're on the West Coast, not really likely any of us are flying out there.

02:17:01.917 --> 02:17:02.077
[SPEAKER_35]: No.

02:17:02.218 --> 02:17:03.218
[SPEAKER_35]: Buy us a plane ticket.

02:17:03.278 --> 02:17:04.798
[SPEAKER_35]: We will gladly make a cameo.

02:17:05.859 --> 02:17:08.000
[SPEAKER_35]: Nobody here has any travel plans to New York in October?

02:17:08.240 --> 02:17:10.400
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm going at the end of September, but there's no tournament.

02:17:10.500 --> 02:17:11.501
[SPEAKER_35]: I might go to eight on the break, though.

02:17:11.521 --> 02:17:14.702
[SPEAKER_35]: Yeah, I might be going to New York in September to blow up another building.

02:17:15.022 --> 02:17:15.502
[SPEAKER_30]: Stop it.

02:17:16.182 --> 02:17:16.763
[SPEAKER_30]: Not funny.

02:17:17.383 --> 02:17:17.923
[SPEAKER_30]: Stop it.

02:17:20.049 --> 02:17:21.431
[SPEAKER_30]: It's for my birthday!

02:17:21.531 --> 02:17:22.192
[SPEAKER_30]: Come on!

02:17:23.734 --> 02:17:24.556
[SPEAKER_30]: It worked one year.

02:17:24.576 --> 02:17:25.176
[SPEAKER_35]: It's horrible.

02:17:26.518 --> 02:17:26.899
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright.

02:17:31.906 --> 02:17:34.028
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you for watching!

02:17:52.222 --> 02:17:54.723
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm really sad we didn't get to do that last clue, Sigurd.

02:17:54.743 --> 02:17:56.624
[SPEAKER_35]: We actually had one more clue we were going to do.

02:17:56.984 --> 02:17:57.404
[SPEAKER_35]: Do you want to hear?

02:17:57.784 --> 02:17:58.585
[SPEAKER_35]: We want to still do it?

02:17:59.185 --> 02:17:59.425
[SPEAKER_35]: Okay.

02:18:00.025 --> 02:18:02.807
[SPEAKER_35]: Let's do that last clue we were going to do, alright?

02:18:03.087 --> 02:18:07.469
[SPEAKER_35]: This was the last clue you were going to hear if you didn't get it, even though Irene's not paying attention and the clue involves her.

02:18:07.909 --> 02:18:15.892
[SPEAKER_35]: But, uh, Sigurd... Oh, Sigurd was actually going to let me have the fourth clue, because he didn't want to say this, but this was the fourth clue.

02:18:16.433 --> 02:18:19.374
[SPEAKER_35]: Irene, I just want to say that you have really nice tits.

02:18:21.263 --> 02:18:22.624
[SPEAKER_35]: It's too bad they're kind of little.

02:18:23.965 --> 02:18:26.347
[SPEAKER_33]: In fact, you might call them tittles.

02:18:29.129 --> 02:18:30.110
[SPEAKER_35]: That was the fourth clue.

02:18:31.111 --> 02:18:32.452
[SPEAKER_35]: That was so awful.

02:18:33.833 --> 02:18:36.615
[SPEAKER_33]: That was the clue that Sigurd and I came up with earlier.

02:18:36.895 --> 02:18:37.375
[SPEAKER_29]: I got one.

02:18:37.435 --> 02:18:37.776
[SPEAKER_29]: Hold on.

02:18:37.796 --> 02:18:38.576
[SPEAKER_29]: I got a fifth clue.

02:18:39.737 --> 02:18:41.178
[SPEAKER_29]: Rob, you have a nice dick.

02:18:41.619 --> 02:18:42.940
[SPEAKER_29]: Too bad it's a little little.

02:18:43.840 --> 02:18:45.441
[SPEAKER_29]: You might call it dickle.

02:18:46.762 --> 02:18:47.183
[SPEAKER_19]: Dickle.

02:18:50.263 --> 02:18:50.743
[SPEAKER_35]: Oh, God.

02:18:52.143 --> 02:18:52.884
[SPEAKER_35]: No, I'm just kidding.

02:18:52.984 --> 02:18:54.164
[SPEAKER_35]: Rice Princess has huge boobs.

02:18:55.224 --> 02:18:56.084
[SPEAKER_35]: Don't believe the rumors.

02:18:56.544 --> 02:18:56.904
[SPEAKER_35]: All right.

02:18:57.884 --> 02:18:58.584
[SPEAKER_35]: The rumors?

02:18:58.665 --> 02:18:58.885
[SPEAKER_35]: What?

02:19:00.065 --> 02:19:01.085
[SPEAKER_29]: I haven't started any rumors.

02:19:02.445 --> 02:19:06.346
[SPEAKER_35]: Uh, Kabut says... That's the name.

02:19:06.426 --> 02:19:07.106
[SPEAKER_35]: It's Kabut.

02:19:07.946 --> 02:19:09.366
[SPEAKER_35]: Instead of Kaboom, it's Kabut.

02:19:12.407 --> 02:19:15.627
[SPEAKER_35]: I've said the name, like, twice already in the show because he sent other questions.

02:19:15.687 --> 02:19:18.748
[SPEAKER_35]: Kabut wants to know, how big is your e-penis?

02:19:21.007 --> 02:19:21.747
[SPEAKER_35]: Anybody want to answer?

02:19:21.807 --> 02:19:23.148
[SPEAKER_35]: I think Jamie should answer this one.

02:19:23.728 --> 02:19:25.829
[SPEAKER_35]: DarkSakura, how big is your e-penis?

02:19:29.590 --> 02:19:30.231
[SPEAKER_35]: Very large.

02:19:32.411 --> 02:19:34.092
[SPEAKER_35]: How big is your e-penis, DarkSakura?

02:19:36.033 --> 02:19:40.355
[SPEAKER_35]: She's holding up her hands about four feet.

02:19:41.235 --> 02:19:42.876
[SPEAKER_35]: She's hung like an e-horse.

02:19:45.517 --> 02:19:45.857
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright.

02:19:47.237 --> 02:19:47.797
[SPEAKER_35]: Very lovely.

02:19:48.358 --> 02:19:49.018
[SPEAKER_35]: Nygma has a

02:19:51.300 --> 02:19:52.280
[SPEAKER_35]: I like this question.

02:19:53.181 --> 02:19:55.621
[SPEAKER_35]: Nygma says, does Orange Lounge have t-shirts?

02:19:56.402 --> 02:19:58.942
[SPEAKER_35]: Not yet, but we are definitely looking into it.

02:19:59.022 --> 02:20:01.183
[SPEAKER_35]: We want to sell t-shirts and hopefully make some money.

02:20:01.543 --> 02:20:02.604
[SPEAKER_35]: So not yet, Nygma.

02:20:02.624 --> 02:20:03.844
[SPEAKER_35]: We do not have an official shirt.

02:20:04.164 --> 02:20:05.204
[SPEAKER_35]: We will very soon.

02:20:05.224 --> 02:20:08.465
[SPEAKER_35]: Does Orange Lounge Radio have any internet sex tapes?

02:20:09.706 --> 02:20:09.866
[SPEAKER_35]: No.

02:20:12.847 --> 02:20:13.667
[SPEAKER_35]: Last question.

02:20:14.087 --> 02:20:20.229
[SPEAKER_35]: Karma Titan says, how come last week, my first time on Orange Lounge Radio, how come the place looks different?

02:20:21.091 --> 02:20:24.334
[SPEAKER_35]: Um, didn't we have the big spider web on the camera last week?

02:20:24.374 --> 02:20:25.254
[SPEAKER_35]: That might be one thing.

02:20:25.755 --> 02:20:26.735
[SPEAKER_35]: Yeah, I'm not sure.

02:20:26.775 --> 02:20:28.497
[SPEAKER_35]: I think it's just because we have different people here.

02:20:28.597 --> 02:20:33.280
[SPEAKER_35]: The lighting might be a little different, but we... I turned the camera slightly to the left.

02:20:33.600 --> 02:20:33.861
[SPEAKER_35]: Oh, okay.

02:20:33.901 --> 02:20:34.381
[SPEAKER_35]: I guess that's it.

02:20:34.421 --> 02:20:35.842
[SPEAKER_35]: He turned the camera slightly to the left.

02:20:36.915 --> 02:20:38.876
[SPEAKER_35]: and there's more crap on the table.

02:20:39.757 --> 02:20:41.078
[SPEAKER_35]: Oh, John Fields has a good question.

02:20:41.458 --> 02:20:42.519
[SPEAKER_35]: I'll take this as the last question.

02:20:42.919 --> 02:20:48.482
[SPEAKER_30]: Does Orange House Radio have any... And there's Peach Girl posters on the wall, thanks to Nelly.

02:20:48.602 --> 02:20:49.823
[SPEAKER_30]: Oh, maybe that's what it is.

02:20:49.843 --> 02:20:51.784
[SPEAKER_35]: She hung up the porno posters on the wall.

02:20:53.165 --> 02:20:54.066
[SPEAKER_35]: Maybe that's what it is.

02:20:54.126 --> 02:20:54.966
[SPEAKER_35]: I thought something's different.

02:20:55.347 --> 02:20:55.607
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright.

02:20:58.289 --> 02:20:59.209
[SPEAKER_35]: Last question for John Fields.

02:20:59.229 --> 02:21:04.172
[SPEAKER_35]: Do we have any plans to put old episodes in MP3 on CD for sale at some point in the future?

02:21:04.553 --> 02:21:05.113
[SPEAKER_35]: And actually...

02:21:06.670 --> 02:21:14.295
[SPEAKER_35]: Well, at the Classic Gaming Show, there was another radio station that has to do with retro gaming that was selling copies of their show on DVD.

02:21:14.976 --> 02:21:30.726
[SPEAKER_35]: The only gray area with our show is that we actually play not only Bomani music, but thanks to our cage match, which granted wasn't in the first 20 episodes, but has been there for the majority of our show, the cage match has other real music, so we can't really turn around and sell that music.

02:21:31.327 --> 02:21:34.769
[SPEAKER_35]: We could go through and edit it all out, but that would be kind of a pain in the ass.

02:21:35.229 --> 02:21:35.569
[SPEAKER_35]: I don't know.

02:21:36.030 --> 02:21:38.071
[SPEAKER_35]: So we'll just kind of have to see what happens.

02:21:39.232 --> 02:21:42.974
[SPEAKER_35]: I don't think we can feasibly do it, but I don't know.

02:21:43.074 --> 02:21:47.036
[SPEAKER_35]: As far as distribution plans for getting the old episodes out there, we'll have to just see in the future.

02:21:48.077 --> 02:21:48.397
[SPEAKER_35]: We'll see.

02:21:48.917 --> 02:21:49.218
[SPEAKER_35]: All right.

02:21:50.358 --> 02:21:59.464
[SPEAKER_35]: Also, Angel is the official historian of Orange Lingerie and has them all on MP3, except I would like to point out that this week I forgot to start archiving until about 45 minutes into the show.

02:22:00.805 --> 02:22:06.348
[SPEAKER_35]: So on Thursday during the new Orange Lounge Radio Rewind at 6, you're only going to get part of the show, and that's my bad.

02:22:06.549 --> 02:22:06.789
[SPEAKER_35]: Sorry.

02:22:07.569 --> 02:22:08.169
[SPEAKER_07]: Bad, Rob.

02:22:08.310 --> 02:22:08.650
[SPEAKER_07]: Bad.

02:22:10.111 --> 02:22:13.953
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no one is going to ask me for copies.

02:22:14.413 --> 02:22:15.114
[SPEAKER_07]: No, they're mine.

02:22:16.675 --> 02:22:17.195
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not funny.

02:22:18.336 --> 02:22:18.616
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright.

02:22:19.476 --> 02:22:23.499
[SPEAKER_35]: I guess now it's time to kind of wrap up the show, you guys.

02:22:23.959 --> 02:22:24.339
[SPEAKER_35]: That's it.

02:22:24.379 --> 02:22:26.380
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you for asking the questions on Ask Orange Lounge.

02:22:26.440 --> 02:22:26.821
[SPEAKER_35]: It is 9.30.

02:22:27.601 --> 02:22:28.782
[SPEAKER_35]: Time to wrap up the show.

02:22:29.372 --> 02:22:32.253
[SPEAKER_35]: Go around and get everybody's final thought.

02:22:32.534 --> 02:22:37.716
[SPEAKER_31]: We're going to start off tonight's final thought from... Hand the microphone to somebody, Jimmy.

02:22:38.816 --> 02:22:40.177
[SPEAKER_31]: Oh, who has the second mic?

02:22:42.418 --> 02:22:43.639
[SPEAKER_31]: Oh, sorry, Loki.

02:22:44.679 --> 02:22:46.060
[SPEAKER_31]: Hand that microphone to somebody else.

02:22:49.101 --> 02:22:50.302
[SPEAKER_09]: Say something, somebody.

02:22:54.744 --> 02:22:55.584
[SPEAKER_31]: Jonas, your final thought.

02:22:56.405 --> 02:22:56.965
[SPEAKER_31]: I have none.

02:22:58.613 --> 02:23:04.437
[SPEAKER_31]: LankyStyle, your final thought.

02:23:06.018 --> 02:23:07.338
[SPEAKER_31]: LankyStyle, final thought.

02:23:08.039 --> 02:23:09.620
[SPEAKER_31]: My neck, my back.

02:23:16.804 --> 02:23:18.705
[SPEAKER_35]: Pass off to somebody else, have them give us their final thought.

02:23:22.548 --> 02:23:23.988
[SPEAKER_29]: RicePrincess, your final thought.

02:23:26.670 --> 02:23:28.031
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to miss Seegers.

02:23:29.424 --> 02:23:29.764
[SPEAKER_29]: Aw.

02:23:32.066 --> 02:23:32.386
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright.

02:23:36.268 --> 02:23:37.109
[SPEAKER_35]: Well, Angel.

02:23:38.910 --> 02:23:39.530
[SPEAKER_07]: Crash.

02:23:40.171 --> 02:23:42.232
[SPEAKER_07]: And everyone knows what I'm talking about.

02:23:42.892 --> 02:23:45.454
[SPEAKER_07]: Not that it's a big deal, because I think we can all go home now.

02:23:46.955 --> 02:23:47.295
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

02:23:48.216 --> 02:23:48.596
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

02:23:51.337 --> 02:23:52.838
[SPEAKER_28]: Sigurd, your final thought.

02:23:55.080 --> 02:23:56.901
[SPEAKER_28]: I hope my iPod is done charging.

02:24:01.534 --> 02:24:02.815
[SPEAKER_35]: and Loki, your final thought.

02:24:02.835 --> 02:24:05.758
[SPEAKER_30]: Where's the microphone?

02:24:06.279 --> 02:24:07.299
[SPEAKER_30]: Oh, that's my final thought.

02:24:07.340 --> 02:24:08.300
[SPEAKER_30]: Where's the microphone?

02:24:11.383 --> 02:24:23.374
[SPEAKER_35]: And my final thought is tune in to Pump Up the Volume on Tuesday and Diversion on Monday and who knows what on Wednesday and the Orange Lounge Radio Rewind on Thursday and all the good stuff in between.

02:24:23.655 --> 02:24:27.298
[SPEAKER_35]: The fun just doesn't end here on Orange Lounge Radio Live, that's for sure.

02:24:27.950 --> 02:24:28.791
[SPEAKER_35]: Jamie, your final thought.

02:24:29.551 --> 02:24:35.675
[SPEAKER_09]: Tuesday is Pump Up the Volume with the pre-show starting at 7 o'clock, although it did start a little bit earlier.

02:24:36.176 --> 02:24:42.540
[SPEAKER_09]: On that day, I will be playing the CD of 8-Bit Warriors and also the U.S.

02:24:42.580 --> 02:24:44.561
[SPEAKER_09]: Silent Hill 4 soundtrack in its entirety.

02:24:45.542 --> 02:24:47.704
[SPEAKER_09]: So make sure you're listening.

02:24:48.564 --> 02:24:50.225
[SPEAKER_09]: It will be Q. All right.

02:24:50.726 --> 02:24:54.588
[SPEAKER_35]: The final word of the show, one word to sum up the whole show.

02:24:54.949 --> 02:24:55.269
[SPEAKER_35]: I guess...

02:24:57.187 --> 02:24:58.048
[SPEAKER_35]: Yeah, Rice Princess.

02:24:58.068 --> 02:24:58.990
[SPEAKER_35]: We're going to give our Rice Princess.

02:24:59.010 --> 02:25:00.292
[SPEAKER_35]: She didn't talk a whole lot this show.

02:25:00.713 --> 02:25:03.799
[SPEAKER_35]: Rice Princess, the final word of the show is... Meow.

02:25:05.279 --> 02:25:08.261
[SPEAKER_42]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

02:25:08.841 --> 02:25:12.183
[SPEAKER_42]: Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

02:25:38.707 --> 02:25:42.690
[SPEAKER_11]: Folks, I'd like to sing a song about the American dream.

02:25:43.451 --> 02:25:43.931
[SPEAKER_11]: About me.

02:25:44.792 --> 02:25:45.432
[SPEAKER_11]: About you.

02:25:46.473 --> 02:25:51.036
[SPEAKER_11]: About the way our American hearts beat way down in the bottom of our chests.

02:25:51.437 --> 02:25:54.279
[SPEAKER_11]: About that special feeling we get in the cockles of our hearts.

02:25:54.859 --> 02:25:55.900
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe below the cockles.

02:25:56.340 --> 02:25:57.761
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe in the sub-cockle area.

02:25:58.482 --> 02:25:59.483
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe in the liver.

02:25:59.943 --> 02:26:00.944
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe in the kidneys.

02:26:01.704 --> 02:26:30.707
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe even in the colon, we don't know I'm just a regular Joe with a regular job I'm your average white suburbanite slob I like football and porno and books about war I got an average house with a nice hardwood floor My wife and my job, my kids and my car My feet on my table

[SPEAKER_11]: and a Cuban Cigar

02:27:10.276 --> 02:27:19.338
[SPEAKER_14]: I use public toilets and I piss on the seat I walk around in the summertime saying how about this heat Sometimes I bark

02:27:28.940 --> 02:27:41.464
[SPEAKER_14]: In Handicapped Spaces While Handicapped People Make Handicapped Faces Maybe I shouldn't be singing this song Ranting and raving and carrying on Maybe they're right when they tell me I'm wrong

02:27:59.960 --> 02:28:01.181
You know what I'm gonna do?

02:28:01.201 --> 02:28:03.342
I'm gonna get myself a 1967 Cadillac Eldorado convertible.

02:28:03.382 --> 02:28:07.404
[SPEAKER_14]: Hot pink with a whale skin, hubcaps, and all leather cow interior and big brown baby seal eyes for headlights.

02:28:07.444 --> 02:28:07.524
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah!

02:28:07.544 --> 02:28:10.605
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm gonna drive around in that baby at 115 miles per hour, getting one mile per gallon.

02:28:26.553 --> 02:28:27.313
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching!

02:28:45.558 --> 02:28:46.278
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for watching!

02:29:05.183 --> 02:29:07.626
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, you really are an asshole.

02:29:07.646 --> 02:29:09.328
[SPEAKER_13]: Why don't you just shut up and sing this song, pal?

02:29:09.388 --> 02:29:10.068
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm an asshole!

02:29:10.129 --> 02:29:10.709
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm an asshole!

02:29:27.307 --> 02:29:30.468
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm an asshole, and I'm proud of it.

02:29:56.027 --> 02:29:59.708
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

02:30:25.311 --> 02:30:27.532
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you for watching!

02:30:53.470 --> 02:31:00.172
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright, the afterbirth, the part of the show when the credits have faded to black and you think it's over, but it's really not.

02:31:01.032 --> 02:31:05.193
[SPEAKER_35]: We have to keep it kind of short tonight, though, because I've got to get on the road.

02:31:06.973 --> 02:31:10.134
[SPEAKER_35]: But, I don't know, anybody had anything they wanted to say here in this afterbirth?

02:31:11.254 --> 02:31:12.335
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to go fold my laundry.

02:31:13.495 --> 02:31:14.115
[SPEAKER_31]: Sounds like fun.

02:31:15.655 --> 02:31:19.536
[SPEAKER_31]: And then, anything else you wanted to add, Sigurd?

02:31:20.057 --> 02:31:21.777
[SPEAKER_31]: Anything off the record in the afterbirth of the show?

02:31:22.938 --> 02:31:23.378
[SPEAKER_28]: Not really.

02:31:24.319 --> 02:31:25.019
[SPEAKER_35]: I figured as much.

02:31:25.659 --> 02:31:26.439
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm kind of tired.

02:31:27.140 --> 02:31:28.120
[SPEAKER_35]: We're all exhausted.

02:31:29.241 --> 02:31:29.861
[SPEAKER_35]: We're spent.

02:31:31.141 --> 02:31:35.763
[SPEAKER_35]: I guess I could open up Skype and see if anybody has anything they want to say during this afterbirth.

02:31:35.803 --> 02:31:38.924
[SPEAKER_35]: I hope you guys enjoyed the premiere and all that fun stuff tonight.

02:31:39.425 --> 02:31:40.705
[SPEAKER_35]: It's fun getting to do stuff like that.

02:31:40.725 --> 02:31:41.545
[SPEAKER_35]: I hope we get to do more.

02:31:43.526 --> 02:31:44.447
[SPEAKER_35]: We'll soon see.

02:31:44.867 --> 02:31:50.269
[SPEAKER_35]: I do hear that there is some good stuff coming up for the show, but I can't talk about it or they might send the mob after me.

02:31:50.769 --> 02:31:52.630
[SPEAKER_35]: So that's all I'm going to say for right now.

02:31:53.462 --> 02:31:53.842
[SPEAKER_35]: Yep, yep.

02:31:55.563 --> 02:31:57.063
[SPEAKER_35]: I enjoy talking to myself on air.

02:31:57.083 --> 02:31:57.744
[SPEAKER_35]: Isn't it exciting?

02:32:00.525 --> 02:32:05.246
[SPEAKER_30]: Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

02:32:06.267 --> 02:32:07.227
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't know what the hell that was.

02:32:09.368 --> 02:32:11.228
[SPEAKER_30]: She has a binder clip.

02:32:12.189 --> 02:32:12.589
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah.

02:32:16.370 --> 02:32:18.131
[SPEAKER_30]: No, I'm not singing the man's song.

02:32:23.283 --> 02:32:23.603
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright.

02:32:24.103 --> 02:32:25.364
[SPEAKER_29]: There we go, Jamie's singing it.

02:32:25.384 --> 02:32:27.464
[SPEAKER_35]: Somebody was singing, was Jamie singing it in the back?

02:32:27.504 --> 02:32:29.224
[SPEAKER_29]: Now you're a man, man, man, man.

02:32:30.265 --> 02:32:32.145
[SPEAKER_29]: No must be the day it is.

02:32:32.685 --> 02:32:34.686
[SPEAKER_29]: That needs to be in Karaoke Revolution.

02:32:34.706 --> 02:32:36.146
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh yeah, that needs to be in Karaoke Revolution.

02:32:36.166 --> 02:32:37.946
[SPEAKER_35]: It's not going to be in Karaoke Revolution.

02:32:38.047 --> 02:32:39.207
[SPEAKER_29]: Along with Murmur Twins.

02:32:41.967 --> 02:32:43.848
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright, that's it, forget it.

02:32:45.848 --> 02:32:46.488
[SPEAKER_35]: We're spent.

02:32:47.429 --> 02:32:48.329
[SPEAKER_35]: And we're spent.

02:32:49.029 --> 02:32:51.270
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh, I'm going to give head to one of Loki's joysticks.

02:32:51.850 --> 02:32:52.310
[SPEAKER_35]: Oh, you should.

02:32:52.470 --> 02:32:52.810
You should.

02:32:54.830 --> 02:32:58.172
[SPEAKER_35]: Alright, for the post-show tonight, you get a Bimani Potpourri.

02:32:58.232 --> 02:33:00.854
[SPEAKER_35]: It's a little bit of everything, commercial-free.

02:33:01.355 --> 02:33:08.359
[SPEAKER_35]: Enjoy, have a great night, thank you for tuning in, and we will see you again real soon, we hope.

02:33:08.499 --> 02:33:08.840
[SPEAKER_35]: Good night.

02:34:57.600 --> 02:34:58.340
[SPEAKER_42]: New music.

02:34:58.760 --> 02:34:59.421

We will, we will be young forever

02:39:58.854 --> 02:40:09.530
[SPEAKER_27]: Follow the sound, follow the sound Leaving the rain behind Together we'll be in harmony Taking the time, we will find our way

02:41:33.343 --> 02:41:43.391
what's going on what's going on what's going on what's going on what's going on what's going on

[SPEAKER_04]: This randomness could only be brought to you by Orange Lounge.

02:44:14.918 --> 02:44:39.347
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm getting out of this town Got to pack my bags and bring my wagon around Move it out to the mountain and sky of the trees Move it out where nobody wants to feed anyone And nobody's backing me I wanna be where the creatures are free myself

02:45:07.732 --> 02:45:10.154
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for watching!

[SPEAKER_24]: Before there were words, communication was done through feet.

02:50:46.754 --> 02:50:49.455
Body language is controlled by rhythm.

02:50:49.495 --> 02:50:50.916
Music is a universal leap.

02:50:51.556 --> 02:50:52.557
Feel this, feel these.

02:50:52.577 --> 02:50:54.638

[SPEAKER_23]: You bastard!

03:32:31.775 --> 03:32:37.597
[SPEAKER_23]: You can't expect to wield supreme executive power just because some watery tart threw a sword at you.

03:32:37.777 --> 03:32:43.658
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough whopper.
