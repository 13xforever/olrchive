WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
That was quite interesting. So, now I guess I really am a geek.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.000
Right.

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
Yeah, anyway. Uh, next?

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
Alright, Vandalous, how was your week, how was your day?

00:11.000 --> 00:19.000
My week and day were fine. Well, I went to work and I did family stuff. So, pretty standard stuff for me.

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
Alright. Rice Princess, how was your week, how was your day?

00:24.000 --> 00:25.000
How was my day?

00:25.000 --> 00:26.000
How was your week, how was your day?

00:26.000 --> 00:27.000
How was your day?

00:27.000 --> 00:28.000
Oh.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.000
Um.

00:29.000 --> 00:30.000
Blah.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.000
Just blah?

00:31.000 --> 00:32.000
Yeah.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.000
Alright.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.000
Is that all you want to share?

00:34.000 --> 00:35.000
Yeah.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.000
Okay then.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
Secret!

00:37.000 --> 00:38.000
How was your week?

00:38.000 --> 00:39.000
How was your day?

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
My week was boring.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.640
But today was funny because I went to go get an iPod and I had the worst customer service

00:43.640 --> 00:45.840
in the history of customer service.

00:45.840 --> 00:50.600
When I went to pay for it, the lady at the checkout was basically demanding that I get

00:50.600 --> 00:53.720
the service plan because she was saying it was a piece of crap.

00:53.720 --> 00:56.680
And I swear, if she would have had a knife, she would have held it to my throat until

00:56.680 --> 00:57.680
I got it.

00:57.680 --> 01:02.920
And then we went to Radio Shack, and I asked if they had any accessories, like a holder

01:02.920 --> 01:06.960
or something, and they started, like, saying it was a piece of crap thing, and Apple's

01:06.960 --> 01:08.760
only good for one item.

01:08.760 --> 01:11.600
So I hope they all die.

01:11.600 --> 01:12.600
The end.

01:12.600 --> 01:13.600
Very nice.

01:13.600 --> 01:14.600
Alright.

01:14.600 --> 01:15.600
Alright.

01:15.600 --> 01:23.200
Then there was my week and my day, and my week was pretty uninteresting.

01:23.200 --> 01:26.240
The Classic Gaming Expo I guess was my highlight.

01:26.240 --> 01:28.380
You know, I've just been hanging out with people throughout the week.

01:28.380 --> 01:29.380
That's all.

01:29.380 --> 01:30.380
Nothing too exciting.

01:30.380 --> 01:35.480
All right, I guess at this time we're going to go ahead and go to a break.

01:35.480 --> 01:36.480
Breaks are good.

01:36.480 --> 01:37.480
Yeah, breaks are good.

01:37.480 --> 01:39.580
So we're going to go to a break and then we'll come back and we'll talk to Secret a little

01:39.580 --> 01:42.880
more about Ultramix stuff.

01:42.880 --> 01:43.880
Sound good?

01:43.880 --> 01:44.880
Sounds good.

01:44.880 --> 01:46.880
After this

02:14.880 --> 02:43.880
I feel, I feel, I feel You are the only one that makes me feel this way

02:43.880 --> 03:12.320
So, Segerd, I heard you brought a sound clip with you tonight that you wanted us all to

03:12.320 --> 03:13.320
hear.

03:13.320 --> 03:17.360
yes okay well you should play it I will play that for everybody

03:17.360 --> 03:20.680
is it a hint yeah I think it might be

03:20.680 --> 03:24.480
mama don't like tattletales

03:24.480 --> 03:28.480
That was interesting. Good luck. Alright.

03:54.480 --> 04:00.480
This is the end of the video, thank you so much for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.

04:24.480 --> 04:25.480
Why?

04:25.480 --> 04:26.480
Why?

04:26.480 --> 04:27.480
Why?

04:27.480 --> 04:28.480
Why?

04:28.480 --> 04:29.480
Why?

04:29.480 --> 04:30.480
Why?

04:30.480 --> 04:31.480
Why?

04:31.480 --> 04:32.480
Why?

04:32.480 --> 04:33.480
Why?

04:33.480 --> 04:34.480
Why?

04:34.480 --> 04:35.480
Why?

04:35.480 --> 04:36.480
Why?

04:36.480 --> 04:37.480
Why?

04:37.480 --> 04:38.480
Why?

05:08.480 --> 05:21.000
Momma don't like tattletales.

05:21.000 --> 05:45.000
Do you really think love can make you want to die?

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
Why is this a movie and you are the star?

05:47.000 --> 06:02.480
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it!

06:02.480 --> 06:06.480
It's yours!

06:07.980 --> 06:09.980
Why is this a movie and you are the star?

06:09.980 --> 06:27.120
The beat, the beat, the beat

06:27.120 --> 06:56.400
Orange Lounge Radio.

06:56.400 --> 06:59.400
You put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.

06:59.400 --> 07:01.560
It's server made up of my head number.

07:01.560 --> 07:04.760
It's server made up of my head number.

07:04.760 --> 07:05.540
All right, guys.

07:05.540 --> 07:08.080
During the break, you received the first of the clues tonight.

07:08.080 --> 07:09.840
And this is the way it's going to work.

07:09.840 --> 07:13.960
When we open it up, and only when we say you can guess the song,

07:13.960 --> 07:16.980
send me a private message in the chat room when we say to,

07:16.980 --> 07:18.980
and you'll have an opportunity to guess the song.

07:18.980 --> 07:21.800
If you are the first person to get it right,

07:21.800 --> 07:24.820
if you are one of our Skype users, meaning

07:24.820 --> 07:29.200
If you go to our website, www.orangessontradio.com, and click on interact with us.

07:29.200 --> 07:33.740
If you're right, you can be the one to announce it to everybody on the air what the song is.

07:33.740 --> 07:37.460
If you don't have Skype, though, you can just tell in the chat room and then we'll relay

07:37.460 --> 07:38.580
the message for you.

07:38.580 --> 07:43.020
But again, only at certain times will you be able to submit a guest to me in the chat

07:43.020 --> 07:48.860
room and there'll be more clues to come if that one didn't quite do it for you.

07:48.860 --> 07:50.740
Mama don't like tattle beds.

07:50.740 --> 07:51.740
Alright.

07:51.740 --> 07:52.740
Anyway.

07:52.740 --> 07:53.740
So.

07:53.740 --> 07:57.740
I probably didn't do it for a lot of people, but it's not supposed to be easy.

07:57.740 --> 08:01.740
All right. So Seeker, thank you for bringing the clip. I appreciate that.

08:05.740 --> 08:07.740
Yeah, um, you're welcome.

08:07.740 --> 08:08.740
All right, anytime.

08:08.740 --> 08:12.740
I'm avoiding various cups, just trying to get the microphone over here.

08:12.740 --> 08:14.740
That's right, there's just a lot of people here tonight and a lot of stuff here.

08:14.740 --> 08:15.740
And porn.

08:15.740 --> 08:20.740
So, how is, anything exciting going on at Konami you want to share with the rest of us?

08:20.740 --> 08:21.740
I'll just jump right into it.

08:21.740 --> 08:28.700
into it. There's always exciting stuff going on at Konami, whether I can share it or not.

08:28.700 --> 08:35.120
Actually, there's an interesting thing I can talk about. Everybody who knows about the

08:35.120 --> 08:40.540
game Rumble Roses, it's actually a pretty good game. Just so you know, it's not all

08:40.540 --> 08:50.100
boobs. Okay, it is all boobs, but it's actually fun to play. The interesting thing about it

08:50.100 --> 08:54.400
is that it has the mani artists doing the music

08:54.400 --> 08:57.260
uh... we have a kiriyama oka

08:57.260 --> 09:01.060
which you can stop right there cuz that makes it worth the purchase already

09:01.060 --> 09:04.380
uh... it's got uh... you one

09:04.380 --> 09:06.740
it's got death row

09:06.740 --> 09:08.840
it has talka

09:08.840 --> 09:13.500
it has uh... the person that is general i don't remember the name off

09:13.500 --> 09:17.260
of my head

09:17.260 --> 09:19.220
i'm sorry i just uh...

09:19.220 --> 09:26.220
killed one of the cups all over her angel. How you doing? Is that water? Oh yeah, look

09:26.460 --> 09:33.460
he says watch the cups, thanks! So, yes, what I was going to say is that yeah, it's got

09:34.180 --> 09:41.180
an awesome cover of Yankee Rose, the song that, who is it, David Lee Roth did, that

09:41.820 --> 09:46.780
they used in that old E3 trailer or whatever. That's pretty cool. Yeah, that actually is

09:46.780 --> 09:52.700
a really good song um but yeah um that's the really cool thing about rumble roses um don't

09:52.700 --> 09:56.580
know why they're in there but thank goodness they are because that means i'm gonna buy

09:56.580 --> 10:02.580
it now all right

10:02.580 --> 10:08.400
oh okay um yeah the songs for the most part there is one repeated song um you can actually

10:08.400 --> 10:13.700
hear it on videos that play in game stop in eb games you'll hear look to the sky that's

10:13.700 --> 10:20.700
in it. Also, I think that's the only repeated song. The rest of them are brand new and they

10:21.440 --> 10:28.440
are very, very good. Me personally, I don't like DJ Taka. Yeah, I don't like his music.

10:32.160 --> 10:39.160
But this song is so good. So yeah, I look forward to that.

10:39.160 --> 10:45.160
Alright, so definitely Bomani fans are going to have to suffer through this TNA game.

10:45.160 --> 10:47.160
Don't suffer! It's actually fun!

10:47.160 --> 10:49.160
Alright, alright. I'll take your word for it.

10:49.160 --> 10:53.160
Rob, just because you're gay doesn't mean that everybody else is going to suffer.

10:53.160 --> 10:54.160
Alright, shut up.

10:54.160 --> 10:55.160
You might be the only one.

10:55.160 --> 10:56.160
Ah, be quiet.

10:58.160 --> 11:00.160
Alright, so how's UltraMix 2 looking?

11:00.160 --> 11:03.160
It's starting to get a little bit finalized there? Ready to roll?

11:03.160 --> 11:05.160
UltraMix 2 is looking awesome.

11:05.160 --> 11:06.160
Very nice.

11:06.160 --> 11:14.160
It's very, very cool. This was said earlier in the chat room, I think.

11:14.160 --> 11:22.160
You know, we give hints out on DDR Freak, and one of our hints to my absolute favorite song on that game, Skulk,

11:22.160 --> 11:29.160
Cutress picked it up and linked everybody to an MP3. That was not quite correct.

11:29.160 --> 11:35.160
It was like a remix of the song. We actually have the original version of the song in the game,

11:35.160 --> 11:43.160
So all you trance fans and all that, you're gonna have to cry or something, because the song is not trance. It is synth-pop.

11:43.160 --> 11:46.160
And we're actually gonna play the normal cut of the song. You brought it with you, thank you.

11:46.160 --> 11:52.160
Yeah, because I am now obsessive about this band. I searched the Bay Area just to get the CD.

11:52.160 --> 11:55.160
Took me quite a while, but I did find it, and I absolutely love it.

11:55.160 --> 11:57.160
Alright, cool.

11:57.160 --> 11:59.160
And we got cookies, which...

11:59.160 --> 12:02.160
Oh, tell us about the cookie thing! I wanna talk about the cookie thing!

12:02.160 --> 12:03.160
We'll do that now.

12:03.160 --> 12:10.160
So, we have a member on the DDR Freak board that goes by the name El-Mullet, Hi El-Mullet.

12:10.160 --> 12:15.160
Yeah, I know it's a great name, isn't it?

12:15.160 --> 12:16.160
That's a wonderful name.

12:16.160 --> 12:21.160
And, you know, we're giving our clues out, and I think the clue that we gave was for, like, Night in Motion.

12:21.160 --> 12:32.160
You know, everybody comments on when we announce a song, like, oh, yay, or wow, that's crap, or I'm too indecisive.

12:32.160 --> 12:37.520
and el mole it said something I don't remember but then his reply was like

12:37.520 --> 12:43.320
yeah now you guys just need to announce a moonlight shadow and I'll be happy or

12:43.320 --> 12:47.480
something like that and so since you know I know the track listing and I'm

12:47.480 --> 12:51.240
part of the people that are giving out hints I was like okay the next hint I'm

12:51.240 --> 12:56.320
gonna give out is moonlight shadow so I did and he like promised cookies if it

12:56.320 --> 13:01.920
was in the game so you know we went and said moonlight shadows in the game and I

13:01.920 --> 13:07.920
PM'd him the Konami's address. And so he sent cookies.

13:07.920 --> 13:13.920
Somebody actually followed through on that, and he actually sent cookies. What kind of cookies?

13:13.920 --> 13:15.920
Chewy Chocolate Chips Ahoy.

13:15.920 --> 13:17.920
Oh, yummy.

13:17.920 --> 13:26.920
But it was so unexpected, and me and Floatwalk were just like, you know, just kidding around about it,

13:26.920 --> 13:30.460
the fact that he went through and did that was so awesome and he also wrote a

13:30.460 --> 13:37.340
really nice letter. Oh, I want to read the letter. And it's going to be read on the radio.

13:37.340 --> 13:40.600
Actually, I can't read the whole thing because it's like it's like two

13:40.600 --> 13:44.660
pages. It's a long letter. Yeah. It's a love letter. It says, Secret, I love you, I

13:44.660 --> 13:48.480
want to have your baby. Oh, I'm sorry. That was a different letter. That was the

13:48.480 --> 13:51.920
letter Lanky Style was writing, I'm sorry. The part that scared me was the part

13:51.920 --> 13:55.360
where, like on the second page, there's blood splattered on it. I was kind of like,

13:55.360 --> 14:03.180
I need to, um, Tarai-chan, uh, not homemade, we requested Chewy Chocolate Chips Ahoy because

14:03.180 --> 14:07.640
we had gone through our entire bag the first day we got it from, from the store, so we

14:07.640 --> 14:08.640
wanted more.

14:08.640 --> 14:11.480
Yeah, and to point out, by the way, if you want to interact with our chat room, head

14:11.480 --> 14:15.720
on over to our website, www.orangelaunsradio.com and click on chat, and that's how you can

14:15.720 --> 14:19.960
also participate in tonight's, um, clue guessing game, uh, and you'll have your first opportunity

14:19.960 --> 14:23.860
to submit a guess, maybe you're doing a little research on that last sound clip, or maybe

14:23.860 --> 14:29.060
There's really nothing to research at all, and we're just really fucking with you. I don't know we will soon find out

14:29.540 --> 14:33.340
But if you have a guest you'll have your first chance to submit in a little bit, but first I want to talk about the letter

14:33.980 --> 14:40.900
Let's do the letter. Okay. I have to find some letter reading music though. Play Moonlight Shadow, because it's symbolic or something

14:43.380 --> 14:46.900
To all those involved with DDR Ultramix 2

14:46.900 --> 14:53.540
you. As promised, here are the cookies. I am a man of my word, and I never expected

14:53.540 --> 14:58.780
such a marvelous development to happen. I mean, Moonlight Shadow is my favorite license

14:58.780 --> 15:04.900
of all time, and somehow you guys managed to obtain it. I am impressed, and I am very

15:04.900 --> 15:11.120
thankful. I need to thank you, all of you. With your input and your new ideas, you will

15:11.120 --> 15:18.120
be adding an incredible breath of fresh air to a slowly stagnating series.

15:21.200 --> 15:25.600
Without the Xbox side of DDR, I'm not sure if I would be playing the game still. Sure,

15:25.600 --> 15:30.160
the non-stop Anoni modes from the arcade and PS2 mixes are fun, but over the past couple

15:30.160 --> 15:34.000
of years, these modes have slowly been growing old on their own. With the new innovations

15:34.000 --> 15:38.640
the new American DDR games are receiving, the series would have become stale by now.

15:38.640 --> 15:44.020
Sure, you can add song after song after song on a mix, but there's more to a mix than that.

15:44.020 --> 15:46.640
And so, I offer you these cookies.

15:46.640 --> 15:51.920
Not only for adding my favorite Japanese DDR song onto a US mix, but as a token of my appreciation.

15:51.920 --> 15:55.840
From the game descriptions thus far, you have gone above and beyond the call of duty for

15:55.840 --> 16:00.680
creating a new DDR game, and not simply a rehashed version of a Japanese game.

16:00.680 --> 16:05.280
I never thought I would have become this excited over an Xbox DDR title.

16:05.280 --> 16:10.080
Thank you for going in a different direction and not sticking with the traditional formula.

16:10.080 --> 16:13.840
Is this one of those stories where like at the end like the paraplegic kid starts to

16:13.840 --> 16:14.840
walk or something?

16:14.840 --> 16:15.840
I think so.

16:15.840 --> 16:16.840
Here's the last paragraph.

16:16.840 --> 16:17.840
Okay.

16:17.840 --> 16:20.080
You've earned my money, you've earned my respect, and you've earned these cookies.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.840
Take care in your future endeavors and I wish all goes well for the release of the current

16:22.840 --> 16:23.840
mix.

16:23.840 --> 16:25.840
A fan, a player, and a grateful person.

16:25.840 --> 16:26.840
Elmo it.

16:26.840 --> 16:28.280
Now see, wasn't that awesome?

16:28.280 --> 16:29.280
That was very nice.

16:29.280 --> 16:32.760
I'm sad to say that the song got cut at the last minute, so there's no more Moonlight

16:32.760 --> 16:40.400
shadow oh we got we got we got we got we got cookies so like we can really cut

16:40.400 --> 16:44.580
that song now we'll cut like three others you shouldn't have said just

16:44.580 --> 16:48.480
kidding because then you got another letter without cookies or cookies with

16:48.480 --> 16:52.840
laxative in them yeah you notice y'all had to go to the bathroom after that one

16:52.840 --> 16:55.880
of our team members did not want to eat the cookies because he thought they were

16:55.880 --> 17:00.400
poisonous and we're like so you'll die by cookie that's like a bad thing or

17:00.400 --> 17:03.500
something

17:03.500 --> 17:05.220
i mean it just goes to show you that

17:05.220 --> 17:06.840
if you're nice

17:06.840 --> 17:09.200
uh... cough

17:09.200 --> 17:12.460
extreme u s board cop

17:12.460 --> 17:13.780
this is directed at you

17:13.780 --> 17:17.640
you might get some good stuff in return so i was going to ask you about this

17:17.640 --> 17:20.400
what i was going to corny and just ask you about this while i have you here, why the hell

17:20.400 --> 17:23.800
aren't you posting anything in the extreme u s thread? Give us a clear answer. Have you read

17:23.800 --> 17:25.900
the u s extreme thread? Yes I have.

17:25.900 --> 17:29.020
i'd like to hear from you know i know why i would be most in their body here

17:29.020 --> 17:30.800
from you know

17:30.800 --> 17:32.860
the extreme u s thread

17:32.860 --> 17:35.300
is very

17:35.300 --> 17:38.660
it to put it in a nice way is a very

17:38.660 --> 17:41.000
annoying and stupid

17:41.000 --> 17:42.400
uh...

17:42.400 --> 17:44.380
but and elmo

17:44.380 --> 17:45.340
signature

17:45.340 --> 17:46.540
sums up the best

17:46.540 --> 17:49.140
this is what goes on the the thread there

17:49.140 --> 17:53.560
being it we want our american mixes to be more japanese

17:53.560 --> 17:54.860
it's just like

17:54.860 --> 17:57.820
if you want the japanese games get the japanese ones if you want the american

17:57.820 --> 17:58.700
games

17:58.700 --> 18:00.700
to be jeff

18:00.700 --> 18:02.540
it will

18:02.540 --> 18:05.140
they go play in the arcade if you want it at home

18:05.140 --> 18:10.340
do something else but quit whining that your mix is not exactly like the japanese

18:10.340 --> 18:12.640
one it never will be

18:12.640 --> 18:14.140
and so

18:14.140 --> 18:16.980
yet we have some people we don't like unfair

18:16.980 --> 18:18.420
well uh...

18:18.420 --> 18:20.520
and it is don't hold back now they think

18:20.520 --> 18:22.560
i think they know what they're talking about

18:22.560 --> 18:26.620
why so-and-so isn't in this version and why this looks like this

18:26.620 --> 18:27.800
they don't know anything

18:27.800 --> 18:31.760
and so we get a a good laugh out of the extreme thread

18:31.760 --> 18:33.020
yeah that's about it

18:33.020 --> 18:35.220
that's all that's good for now

18:35.220 --> 18:35.940
well plus

18:35.940 --> 18:39.260
you have the song list for extreme right? yeah i've played extreme

18:39.260 --> 18:43.240
i know all the unlocks i know all the courses and the unlocks are gonna stay unlocks right?

18:43.240 --> 18:44.340
the unlocks are gonna stay unlocks

18:44.340 --> 18:45.500
extreme is done

18:45.500 --> 18:48.380
okay pretty much i mean it comes out the end of september

18:48.380 --> 18:49.520
you guys can wait

18:49.520 --> 18:51.700
yeah i know it's like

18:51.700 --> 18:55.220
The poor UltraMix people, they don't even know their initial song list yet.

18:55.220 --> 18:58.580
And that only comes out a couple months after.

18:58.580 --> 19:03.660
So we're paying attention to them because, you know, they have, I'm guessing, around

19:03.660 --> 19:05.300
twenty songs announced so far.

19:05.300 --> 19:07.200
It's probably even less than that.

19:07.200 --> 19:10.060
And you guys have a whole forty-five, I think?

19:10.060 --> 19:11.580
So this is just catching up.

19:11.580 --> 19:14.060
Tonight we'll have twenty-one, hopefully somebody will get it.

19:14.060 --> 19:15.060
Tonight's twenty-one, yeah.

19:15.060 --> 19:16.060
I mean, it doesn't matter.

19:16.060 --> 19:17.420
In fact, you know what guys?

19:17.420 --> 19:18.420
Here's your first chance.

19:18.420 --> 19:25.420
For the next three minutes, you can send me a private message if you have a guess on what the song is, and if you get it right, you get to tell everybody.

19:25.420 --> 19:28.420
So here it is, send a private message to Sky in the chatroom with your guess.

19:28.420 --> 19:33.420
If you guys honestly get it off that one clue, I might have to send you cookies.

19:33.420 --> 19:40.420
And when you say cookies, it's a metaphor for something else, right?

19:40.420 --> 19:45.420
Yeah, it's probably like me boxed up with a little bow tie.

19:45.420 --> 19:46.420
Okay, anyway.

19:46.420 --> 19:49.180
Vandalus is our official timekeeper, by the way, and he'll let you guys know in the chat

19:49.180 --> 19:51.860
room when your time is up, so.

19:51.860 --> 19:52.860
Alright.

19:52.860 --> 20:01.980
Okay, so, um, so, Ultramix 2, and Xtreme, do we have a firm release date for either

20:01.980 --> 20:02.980
one yet?

20:02.980 --> 20:03.980
I don't know what you can and can't say.

20:03.980 --> 20:04.980
No.

20:04.980 --> 20:05.980
We don't have a firm release date.

20:05.980 --> 20:06.980
We just know September-ish.

20:06.980 --> 20:07.980
You know what?

20:07.980 --> 20:12.500
Xtreme might have one, off the top of my head, I'm not sure what was said in the press release.

20:12.500 --> 20:14.260
You have to go by what's said in the press release.

20:14.260 --> 20:18.100
I might have a more specific date, I might not.

20:18.100 --> 20:22.940
Just look forward to it towards the end of the month.

20:22.940 --> 20:29.060
Extreme or not extreme, UltraMix, we're shooting for November sometime.

20:29.060 --> 20:32.660
So you know when you pick up Halo 2, pick up UltraMix 2.

20:32.660 --> 20:36.260
Just get the ones that have number 2 in them, just remember that.

20:36.260 --> 20:40.420
But more specifically the one with UltraMix in the title as well.

20:40.420 --> 20:43.580
It's a really great game.

20:43.580 --> 20:45.580
That's all I really can say about it, I guess.

20:45.580 --> 20:47.580
Alright, sounds good.

20:49.580 --> 20:52.580
I'm trying to get the Echo Image song, Skulk.

20:52.580 --> 20:53.580
Okay.

20:53.580 --> 20:55.580
Tell us a little bit about this song.

20:55.580 --> 20:58.580
I don't know if you can talk about where it comes from or anything,

20:58.580 --> 21:00.580
but I don't know what you can say or what you can't say.

21:00.580 --> 21:02.580
Let me, okay.

21:02.580 --> 21:07.580
Echo Image, the song Skulk, is U.S. exclusive, obviously.

21:07.580 --> 21:09.580
Not economy original.

21:09.580 --> 21:12.720
It's... I won't say...

21:12.720 --> 21:17.120
Let me think here. You don't have to say anything more if you don't want to.

21:17.120 --> 21:20.920
When you play the game, there will be a few songs

21:20.920 --> 21:24.320
that you'll notice the background images have URLs in them.

21:24.320 --> 21:28.160
This will be one of them. So...

21:28.160 --> 21:32.360
Yeah. Just know that it's a really good song

21:32.360 --> 21:36.080
and it's probably my favorite, but as everybody can tell you, I have

21:36.080 --> 21:43.840
really bad taste in music. Oh, no. No, seriously, like, like, oh, shut up! Kiriyama is the best

21:43.840 --> 21:53.040
thing that's ever happened to the... I know, but I was being... joking, too. Um... I'm

21:53.040 --> 22:00.120
confused now, great. Um, yeah, so, uh, Echo Image, Skulk, awesome, you guys have been

22:00.120 --> 22:05.280
led astray by Cutriss, because the song you guys have been downloading from Amazon, it

22:05.280 --> 22:07.860
It doesn't sound anything like the actual song, really.

22:07.860 --> 22:08.860
But we are gonna play the actual song?

22:08.860 --> 22:11.160
Yeah, we're gonna have the actual song up here.

22:11.160 --> 22:15.280
And, actually what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna leave the microphones on, if, now it's cool

22:15.280 --> 22:16.280
you can do this, right?

22:16.280 --> 22:18.080
You're gonna tell us kinda what portions of the song.

22:18.080 --> 22:19.080
Yeah.

22:19.080 --> 22:21.880
So this is the first time we've really done anything like this, you're gonna tell us kinda

22:21.880 --> 22:24.200
what portions of the song are actually in the game.

22:24.200 --> 22:25.200
Yeah.

22:25.200 --> 22:26.200
Alright.

22:26.200 --> 22:31.920
Just because, I don't know, back when Max 2, Max 1 USA came out, I know people were

22:31.920 --> 22:35.240
like, you leave me alone so awesome, and then what did they do?

22:35.240 --> 22:39.660
it took like one part of the song this is just music and so i kind of don't

22:39.660 --> 22:43.300
want that happen again people you disappointed

22:43.300 --> 22:46.000
well i'm i'm waiting on that i'm kinda stretching time here's a meeting for the

22:46.000 --> 22:49.520
three minutes to run out here that was his keeping time and uh... let me check

22:49.520 --> 22:52.800
the guesses we got three guesses so far

22:52.800 --> 22:55.920
no that's not it white rob

22:55.920 --> 23:01.440
that's not it and j and you know only one gals when we close the windows but

23:01.440 --> 23:06.060
you should read what they they put so i can laugh oh um...

23:06.060 --> 23:08.080
forgot the one that white rob guests sorry

23:08.080 --> 23:11.720
uh... and j f i two four i only take the first guess only get one guess uh...

23:11.720 --> 23:15.260
turn uh... he says the theme to take tracy

23:15.260 --> 23:16.460
and whatever that comes from

23:16.460 --> 23:17.880
nigma says

23:17.880 --> 23:21.340
my guess is one something from elvis or two memories

23:21.340 --> 23:26.040
uh... pointing that's not specific so no and for second thing

23:26.040 --> 23:30.260
i went ok all about what number one i think that something from elvis but

23:30.260 --> 23:33.940
But that's not a song name, so I have to throw that guess out, so you gotta give me song

23:33.940 --> 23:35.940
name and title.

23:35.940 --> 23:41.420
And we prefer on the board reasoning as well, you can't be like, cause you might be able

23:41.420 --> 23:45.700
to get some stab in the dark and like, get a song right, but if you don't have reasoning,

23:45.700 --> 23:48.340
then we're not gonna tell you.

23:48.340 --> 23:56.020
And lastly, last pick here, Jazz is saying Silent Hill STFU mix.

23:56.020 --> 23:57.020
Nice guess, but no.

23:57.020 --> 24:02.700
Cutress is in our chat room and he's saying he's being schooled by you.

24:02.700 --> 24:06.460
Oh, there's nothing but love between us, Cutress.

24:06.460 --> 24:11.340
Honestly, I think the mix that we're gonna play here that

24:11.340 --> 24:14.660
Seacred's got, it's not that much different. It's just that the one

24:14.660 --> 24:18.340
that was on the site was a little more trance-y. But I liked it.

24:18.340 --> 24:22.020
Personally, I thought it was a great track. I don't like it. I don't like that mix.

24:22.020 --> 24:25.820
I can't fault him for that because he was just going off

24:25.820 --> 24:32.080
know what he saw so you know I'm not really making fun of him right now all

24:32.080 --> 24:37.060
right the other thing I'd like to mention that the whole genre synth pop

24:37.060 --> 24:40.940
at least you know my basing it off of this one group it's pretty much trance

24:40.940 --> 24:45.420
mixed with industrial anyways so yeah I mean it's not that it's a little happier

24:45.420 --> 24:51.420
too yeah it's like it's like if you were to take goth music and make it happy and

24:51.420 --> 24:53.760
And add trance to it. There you go

24:56.320 --> 24:59.000
Yes, like so is this a new mic

25:01.080 --> 25:07.380
Little bit of information for you to if you didn't know but all trance and techno and all things derivative are all just disco so

25:08.700 --> 25:11.340
All right, you ready to play the song actually wait one thing I want to point out

25:11.340 --> 25:17.180
Where did you finally find this album? I finally found it after a long time of searching at a Rasputin Records

25:17.180 --> 25:21.980
in San Francisco. I had been searching the whole Bay Area. I went to all the

25:21.980 --> 25:26.820
little shops I could find, and then I lucked out, and they had one copy, and

25:26.820 --> 25:32.140
they held it for me. And where was it? Where was it? In the Goth section. In the

25:32.140 --> 25:37.620
Goth section. So the music you're about to hear is Goth, according to... Technically, yes. If you

25:37.620 --> 25:43.980
trust Rasputin's titling of their music, it's it's a Goth. All right. Here we go.

25:43.980 --> 25:47.220
here's a song and I'm gonna leave the microphones on so studio just you know

25:47.220 --> 25:50.100
the microphones are still hot you know I'll just tell you what part isn't in it

25:50.100 --> 25:53.460
instead of telling you you know this is it starts okay then you tell us what

25:53.460 --> 26:00.220
parts are in it oh okay here we go

26:00.220 --> 26:16.540
Okay, yeah, this is obviously the intro to the song, but we have that too.

26:16.540 --> 26:34.920
You know, this part right here actually is also in it.

26:34.920 --> 26:40.660
The section of the music that sounded just like this a second ago, that's not in it.

26:40.660 --> 26:41.660
There's a bit of a difference.

26:41.660 --> 27:10.060
the difference.

27:10.060 --> 27:17.060
This part here is not in the game at all, so whenever the guy is seen by himself like this, it's not in there.

27:17.060 --> 27:21.060
Which is not a big loss, even though I think the song is good.

27:47.060 --> 28:11.860
This music right here is still not in it

28:11.860 --> 28:27.660
Trust me, there is music in this song that we have, so it's, I don't, it's the chat room

28:27.660 --> 28:32.460
people like, they know what they're talking about too.

28:32.460 --> 28:37.540
Once again, he's singing, so that means it's not the game.

28:37.540 --> 28:41.540
Yeah, pretty much we have the beginning of the song and the end of the song.

28:45.540 --> 28:47.540
We mix that...

28:47.540 --> 28:49.540
What mix?

28:49.540 --> 28:51.540
This is on UltraMix.

28:51.540 --> 28:52.380
Two.

29:21.540 --> 29:28.540
Okay, this music, we actually have. So, rejoice in it or something.

29:28.540 --> 29:52.540
The first time I heard this, it was like 80s music, but maybe I just know it's from pop.

29:52.540 --> 29:59.540
Okay, actually, from here on out, the rest is an UltraMix, so, cool.

30:22.540 --> 30:28.040
So, let it keep me hanging on

30:28.040 --> 30:31.040
Understand me now

30:31.040 --> 30:36.040
The frequent of the beat gets higher

30:37.040 --> 30:45.040
So yeah, this song will definitely, um, from people I've talked to that have heard this song, they think it's probably gonna be the breakout song for this mix.

30:45.040 --> 30:49.040
Um, and this music right here is not actually in the game, I lied.

30:49.040 --> 30:54.040
Um, so just up until the point where he kinda fades out is in the game.

30:54.040 --> 31:01.040
I'll let the last 30 seconds of the full mix play out.

31:05.040 --> 31:12.040
Yeah, now isn't this totally a goth song? Shouldn't you be wearing black nail polish and makeup?

31:12.040 --> 31:16.040
Yeah, now isn't this totally a goth song? Shouldn't you be wearing black nail polish and makeup?

31:21.040 --> 31:26.040
Alright, that's Echo Image with Skulk, with Seager doing some narrations there about what's in and not in the game.

31:26.040 --> 31:28.040
My new favorite band! I love it!

31:28.040 --> 31:34.040
So, you were kind of saying over there, they might not have heard it, what was kind of the reaction of the song around The Office from the testers?

31:34.040 --> 31:39.040
People think it's a really great song, and it's probably going to be like the breakout song for the game.

31:39.040 --> 31:46.040
for the game. I mean, it's from a band you've never heard of, and so now you'll know that

31:47.220 --> 31:54.220
what? It's like, you can go find their CDs if you hunt hard enough, or actually you can

31:55.820 --> 32:02.820
get online pretty easily, but I wouldn't be surprised if we do Ultramix 3 or something

32:02.820 --> 32:06.980
or something, that we might have to pay a lot of money to get some

32:06.980 --> 32:10.060
band like this now. If it really is that well-received.

32:10.060 --> 32:14.100
I think it's a great song and I agree I think it's gonna be one of those songs that

32:14.100 --> 32:18.060
suddenly the band is gonna get noticed by all these DDR people, they're gonna be like

32:18.060 --> 32:19.580
why all these DDR people go away?

32:19.580 --> 32:23.980
But I think it's a great song. It's kinda like, I kinda compared it to Dark Black

32:23.980 --> 32:27.420
Forest which I sorta saw as kinda like a breakout song from Max USA. I know a lot of

32:27.420 --> 32:28.140
people kinda feel

32:28.140 --> 32:32.180
about it, but it was kind of a song like nobody knew who the hell that guy was

32:32.180 --> 32:36.180
And then a lot of people were like, hey, but the song's pretty cool, except for that vocal part.

32:36.180 --> 32:38.180
Where are we going?

32:38.180 --> 32:40.180
Now here's what they need to do.

32:40.180 --> 32:44.180
Because there's going to be, of course, a lot of these commercial artists,

32:44.180 --> 32:46.180
some of which might not be known.

32:46.180 --> 32:49.180
They need to do what they've done with DDR Extreme

32:49.180 --> 32:54.180
and do their live shows, tour these people that you might not have heard of before,

32:54.180 --> 32:57.180
and do these songs in a giant tour. That'd be awesome.

32:57.180 --> 33:01.180
The kind of sad thing about it, though, since I'm now a huge fan of this band,

33:01.180 --> 33:07.180
is that this song is back from, like, 2001, and I believe it's the singer has left the band.

33:07.180 --> 33:15.180
So, actually, if you go to their website, echoimage.com, I believe, they have new tracks that they're working on up for download,

33:15.180 --> 33:18.180
or they did last time I checked, to kind of show off some of their new stuff.

33:18.180 --> 33:24.180
I haven't actually listened to their new stuff yet, but this CD's good, so I guess that's all that matters.

33:24.180 --> 33:27.180
Alright, so hope you enjoyed that track. Anybody else want to comment on the song?

33:27.180 --> 33:30.180
Yeah, I think Denise Richards has a really big butt.

33:30.180 --> 33:32.180
But it has nothing to do with the song.

33:32.180 --> 33:35.180
Shush.

33:35.180 --> 33:36.580
Shame on you.

33:36.580 --> 33:38.260
Anybody else want to comment on?

33:38.260 --> 33:39.060
No.

33:39.060 --> 33:42.060
Rice Princess, I know you go to, well, I'll get back to Rice Princess.

33:42.060 --> 33:44.020
Let Dark Sakura make her comment.

33:44.020 --> 33:47.140
Rice Princess, just give the mic to somebody.

33:47.140 --> 33:48.300
Give it to Dark Sakura.

33:48.300 --> 33:48.900
She's the host.

33:48.900 --> 33:49.620
She gets to talk.

33:49.620 --> 33:50.500
I'm sorry.

33:50.500 --> 33:51.000
All right.

33:51.000 --> 33:51.500
I'm so sorry.

33:51.500 --> 33:54.660
Rice Princess, I know you go to a lot of golf clubs sometimes.

33:54.660 --> 33:56.420
Is that, or at least one.

33:56.420 --> 33:59.020
Is that a song you'd expect to hear there?

33:59.020 --> 34:01.780
Well, you know...

34:01.780 --> 34:05.460
As the night is tragic!

34:05.460 --> 34:09.460
It doesn't sound like a bat, so, no, I'm kidding.

34:09.460 --> 34:10.740
No, it doesn't.

34:10.740 --> 34:13.900
It doesn't sound anything like I would hear at

34:13.900 --> 34:18.340
a Goth club. I could definitely hear that at an industrial type club.

34:18.340 --> 34:25.140
Something that would play like, you know, KM FDM and stuff like that could definitely go into this.

34:25.140 --> 34:28.180
You got Goth served.

34:28.180 --> 34:31.460
Yeah, it's just a little too techno. Maybe I'm just

34:31.460 --> 34:34.660
like used to more of the stuff that was like out in the 90s.

34:34.660 --> 34:37.860
Maybe the new Goth stuff is different, but

34:37.860 --> 34:41.820
I don't know. I haven't really heard a lot of new

34:41.820 --> 34:44.340
Gothic music, so.

34:44.340 --> 34:48.440
Also, I wanted to point out while I was looking for this CD in the Goth section,

34:48.440 --> 34:52.220
I found stuff like Delirium in there, which I don't think there's...

34:52.220 --> 34:54.540
Delirium? No, that was the other one.

34:54.540 --> 34:56.760
yeah that's right

34:56.760 --> 35:00.040
you know the whole thing that's been going on with the gothic scene nowadays

35:00.040 --> 35:01.840
they're all gravers

35:01.840 --> 35:03.920
and if you don't know what a graver is

35:03.920 --> 35:06.680
like a gothic raver

35:06.680 --> 35:08.520
who is open the door dammit

35:08.520 --> 35:12.060
chamber door

35:12.060 --> 35:15.080
you do not touch the cable modem

35:15.080 --> 35:16.240
don't even look at it

35:16.240 --> 35:17.160
walk in

35:17.160 --> 35:17.920
enter

35:17.920 --> 35:20.700
move towards away from the cable modem

35:20.700 --> 35:22.080
there you go

35:22.080 --> 35:35.080
We got explicit. Again, for those who are just joining us tonight, Comcast's modem that we have from them has been giving us issues all week, so we're afraid that if anybody looks at it funny, we're going to disconnect, and all you guys will get dropped from the show, and we'll have to reconnect, and all that ugly stuff.

35:35.080 --> 35:37.080
Oh sure, don't introduce our guest.

35:37.080 --> 35:40.080
Oh yeah, explicit's here. Well, he's been here every week, so...

35:40.080 --> 35:41.080
We have to...

35:41.080 --> 35:43.080
They know who he is.

35:43.080 --> 35:44.080
Alright.

35:44.080 --> 35:49.080
Jamie, you had a comment you wanted to make earlier we weren't able to get to.

35:49.080 --> 35:54.080
Yeah, you raised your hand trying to grab the mic and you didn't get it.

35:54.080 --> 35:57.080
I like the song. Okay.

35:57.080 --> 36:00.080
Right on. So like on a cage match scale of one to ten?

36:00.080 --> 36:01.080
Eight.

36:01.080 --> 36:02.080
Eight?

36:02.080 --> 36:06.080
I mean, it was kind of repetitive and then it changed.

36:06.080 --> 36:11.080
It's like, I was sort of like falling back into the whole, okay, this is cool.

36:11.080 --> 36:14.080
Oh wait, it's different now. So, that was good.

36:14.080 --> 36:18.080
I like songs that sort of get me stuck on a pattern and then change suddenly.

36:18.080 --> 36:19.080
So it's pretty cool.

36:19.080 --> 36:20.080
Right on.

36:21.080 --> 36:22.080
I listen to it.

36:23.080 --> 36:30.080
So, I'm trying to think if there's any other UltraMix or Extreme-related questions that we can ask Seagurd before we-

36:30.080 --> 36:32.080
What color's the box?

36:32.080 --> 36:33.080
Stop.

36:33.080 --> 36:41.320
Uh, what uh, actually I have questions about other Konami games.

36:41.320 --> 36:43.720
I can try to answer them.

36:43.720 --> 36:47.480
Can you give us any new news on Silent Hill 4 The Room, other than the fact that it's

36:47.480 --> 36:50.080
coming out soon?

36:50.080 --> 36:59.320
It's really fun, and I've beaten it many times, because I, yeah, um, no, it's coming out for

36:59.320 --> 37:04.260
Xbox here. That and PC, I guess. That's the big thing about Silent Hill 4 here. And the

37:04.260 --> 37:10.940
soundtrack, which we kind of talked about a couple weeks ago. It was really good. And

37:10.940 --> 37:11.940
it's still really good.

37:11.940 --> 37:15.420
Jamie managed to get a copy of it, right? From the store?

37:15.420 --> 37:23.540
Yeah. It's available now. I think it's really only for pre-orders. And people who live with

37:23.540 --> 37:30.100
GameStop employees, apparently. Those cheaters. Not supporting Silent Hill 4.

37:30.100 --> 37:37.820
Oh, if it's pre-ordered, it's cool then. But yeah, Silent Hill 5 has recently been talked

37:37.820 --> 37:44.220
about out on the internet. It won't happen until the next generation of consoles, which

37:44.220 --> 37:47.300
is sad. And, you know, at the same time, it could be really good. Yeah, not until the

37:47.300 --> 37:53.500
next generation consoles. They actually really haven't decided which brand they're going

37:53.500 --> 37:59.480
going to, if they're going to Microsoft or Sony. They'll probably do both, but yeah.

37:59.480 --> 38:04.200
So that's up with Silent Hill stuff, I guess. Any news you can give us on Gradius 5, other

38:04.200 --> 38:06.160
than, well, I guess we all saw the Classic Gaming Xbox, right?

38:06.160 --> 38:08.720
Yeah, it's like coming out September 6th. What else can I, you already caught up on

38:08.720 --> 38:13.180
Rumble Roses, what else is coming out of Super Konami, Suicoden IV?

38:13.180 --> 38:19.040
It was originally slated for a hopeful November release. It is now pushed back into January,

38:19.040 --> 38:25.200
which makes me sad. Thank goodness my copy will be here next week, the Japanese

38:25.200 --> 38:31.400
one at least, so I'll get to play some of that. Okay, we have a question. Hold on.

38:31.400 --> 38:43.120
Yes. East 6. It's pretty cool. I've not really had a chance to play it.

38:43.120 --> 38:47.480
I've watched a little bit of it. I know there are some people complaining about

38:47.480 --> 38:51.960
about some issues that Konami is doing with the game, like the sprite models or something,

38:51.960 --> 39:01.440
how they're 3D now instead of 2D. I don't understand the complaints, but yeah, it looks

39:01.440 --> 39:04.720
pretty good, really nice, graphically.

39:04.720 --> 39:11.240
Did you say somebody was complaining that they changed the sprites from 2D to 3D for

39:11.240 --> 39:15.000
E6, because the game was originally all in 3D?

39:15.000 --> 39:21.780
what I'm saying but you know internet people can be stupid yeah it's not it's

39:21.780 --> 39:26.140
not comics decision you can't blame the company that's just bringing it out or

39:26.140 --> 39:31.660
you can I guess if they did the same exact thing when Suikoden 3 came out

39:31.660 --> 39:38.160
because they went to the crappy looking blocky 3d models if they they they

39:38.160 --> 39:44.700
looked it's it's okay for Suikoden 4 is like the best looking game in that

39:44.700 --> 39:51.700
I can't believe you work for Konami and you're not corrupted and play Yu-Gi-Oh like all the other employees do.

40:14.700 --> 40:17.700
Not all the other employees, just a select few.

40:44.700 --> 40:51.700
and sent it around the internet saying that it was a PC version of Silent Hill 1, even though there was never been a PC version of Silent Hill 1.

40:51.700 --> 40:57.700
Has Konami ever, like, said anything about this? Have they noticed this and said, like, hey, or anything about it?

40:57.700 --> 41:07.700
Um, I have never heard of that personally, and I pretty much can say that there never was a Silent Hill PC version.

41:07.700 --> 41:09.980
Once again, it's the internet full of stupid people

41:11.300 --> 41:17.580
But yeah, if it were if there were a Silent Hill PC version, I would be one of the people to know about it. So

41:20.620 --> 41:24.340
Crazy question from the chat room and I think even I could answer this one

41:24.340 --> 41:25.140
But okay

41:25.140 --> 41:31.180
let me let me break their hearts once to know about the Simpsons arcade game ever possibly coming out on Gameboy Advance and

41:31.820 --> 41:33.820
I can answer this

41:33.820 --> 41:37.820
Acclaim does all the licenses for The Simpsons, correct? Not Konami?

41:37.820 --> 41:56.820
Yeah, this is kind of related. We got an email from some stupid person asking, yeah I know it's great, I think of them highly, asking us to bring out a Final Fantasy 7 fighting game.

41:56.820 --> 41:59.820
And it was the funny...

41:59.820 --> 42:05.820
Well, yeah, there's Eregas, but I really don't remember when we merged with Square Enix, so...

42:05.820 --> 42:07.820
Squeenixnami!

42:07.820 --> 42:09.820
Squeenixnami!

42:09.820 --> 42:11.820
Squeenami!

42:16.820 --> 42:18.820
I like Squeenami, I have to say.

42:18.820 --> 42:20.820
Squeenami.

42:20.820 --> 42:27.820
There's some funny people that send in some great emails, and that's just one of their best ones.

42:27.820 --> 42:32.820
I want to know if you guys are going to release a good Ridge Racer.

42:32.820 --> 42:35.820
I really like the Pac-Man car.

42:35.820 --> 42:39.820
Alright, we've got to get the show moving, because we've got a ton of Imani news to get to too,

42:39.820 --> 42:43.820
and I think Seagrid wants to give some more clues soon.

42:43.820 --> 42:48.820
Alright, let's get into tonight's cage match, shall we?

42:48.820 --> 42:55.900
The way the cage match works is that we play three songs for you, each host, myself, Loki,

42:55.900 --> 42:57.060
and Dark Sacra.

42:57.060 --> 43:01.820
We each pick one song to play for you guys, and you're going to pick your favorite of

43:01.820 --> 43:02.820
the three songs.

43:02.820 --> 43:08.140
And the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio in our Bomani

43:08.140 --> 43:15.420
Music and More program, which is on the air 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

43:15.420 --> 43:22.100
We have to be in our chat room to participate though, www.orangeloungeradio.com and click

43:22.100 --> 43:26.100
on chat.

43:26.100 --> 43:30.300
And we're going to do the first song, which won last week, and it was a track that was

43:30.300 --> 43:36.700
by Outfaze, although we all deemed it to be fake, not really an Outfaze song, but for

43:36.700 --> 43:40.700
whatever reason you guys liked it anyway, and it was Loki's pick, and the song is new

43:40.700 --> 43:45.160
on and it won last week, so we only get to hear a clip of it because it was the winner.

43:45.160 --> 43:49.680
So here it is, not out phase with Nuon, last week's winner.

44:15.160 --> 44:17.160
Oh

45:45.160 --> 45:56.840
Alright, that was song number one in tonight's cage match, DJ Taka and Tack with Outfaze

45:56.840 --> 45:57.840
and Nuon.

45:57.840 --> 46:04.300
Next up in tonight's cage match is Jamie's pick, but first, Seagurd, didn't you bring

46:04.300 --> 46:09.380
something else you wanted to play for our listeners tonight?

46:09.380 --> 46:12.620
He's nodding yes, they can't hear him because he's in the kitchen, but I'll go ahead and

46:12.620 --> 46:21.020
play this sound clip that Sigurd wanted me to play for you guys that's it oh he's

46:21.020 --> 46:26.980
loud here here it is one more time hmm interesting well you know what we're

46:26.980 --> 46:31.020
gonna help you guys out though I happen to have the website that that sound clip

46:31.020 --> 46:40.380
came from so enjoy one more time all right and I posted that website in our

46:40.380 --> 46:47.380
chat room, have fun kids. Alright, back into our cage match. Song number two is from Jamie

46:47.380 --> 46:54.140
Tonight, and what is your pick tonight, Jamie? Something from Basement Jaxx, I don't remember.

46:54.140 --> 46:58.780
The song was Lucky Star, if you needed it. Oh yeah, Lucky Star from Basement Jaxx. Alright,

46:58.780 --> 47:04.820
any particular reason you wanted to pick this song? Cause I like it. Alright. I was high

47:04.820 --> 47:11.820
Alright, here it is, Basement Jaxx with Lucky Star, it's song number two in tonight's cage match. Enjoy!

47:34.820 --> 47:35.820
but not obliviously

47:35.820 --> 47:37.820
systematically and vigorously

47:37.820 --> 47:39.820
society became so guilty

47:39.820 --> 47:40.820
just quick to move on

47:40.820 --> 47:41.820
nothing that helps us

47:41.820 --> 47:43.820
we went up so ridiculously

47:43.820 --> 47:45.820
beauty portrayed so innocently

47:45.820 --> 47:47.820
us natives act immigrately

47:47.820 --> 47:49.820
we were carrying on to poverty

47:49.820 --> 47:51.820
little justice crammed the wall

47:51.820 --> 47:52.820
i was born in a court of the prophet

47:52.820 --> 47:53.820
yes i was a stan

47:53.820 --> 47:55.820
just put money on trial

47:55.820 --> 47:56.820
robbery started affecting me

47:56.820 --> 47:57.820
kept me in the sky

47:57.820 --> 47:58.820
in the old field

47:58.820 --> 47:59.820
i watched state music

47:59.820 --> 48:00.820
see a state

48:00.820 --> 48:01.820
to the front

48:01.820 --> 48:03.820
get to the house on the hill

48:33.820 --> 48:37.040
I'm living straight up a reason, pecking, crying

48:37.040 --> 48:38.540
I've come far in a little long way

48:38.540 --> 48:40.540
I would just like to say I feel fine

48:40.540 --> 48:42.540
Cause I will die for a little long day

48:42.540 --> 48:44.540
The streets right here don't pay so great

48:44.540 --> 48:46.140
I was letting in a little long stay

48:46.140 --> 48:48.140
I would just like to say I feel great

48:48.140 --> 48:49.540
So don't make me lost

48:49.540 --> 48:51.540
Won't you lie back? I've been doing money for a trip

48:51.540 --> 48:53.340
Let's move on, we'll begin

48:53.340 --> 48:55.840
Won't you lie back, boy? And let's have a world war

48:55.840 --> 48:57.340
Call and not be rude

48:57.340 --> 48:59.340
Won't you lie back, radio one, two, three

48:59.340 --> 49:00.840
Pay your taxes till the neighbors see

49:00.840 --> 49:02.840
Won't you lie back? I'm sitting here for a school break

50:02.840 --> 50:04.840
I'll be, I'll be, I'll be

51:02.840 --> 51:04.840
Oh

51:32.840 --> 51:52.120
Welcome back to song number two of Bassman Jaxx with Lucky Star.

51:52.120 --> 51:55.840
Let's go around and see what the folks in here thought, but remember, it's up to you

51:55.840 --> 51:58.440
guys in the end, so you have to be in our chat room too, I guess.

51:58.440 --> 51:59.440
Uh, dark saccharine.

51:59.440 --> 52:05.720
I like songs with like a lot of beat and a lot of rhythm, but like a lot of substance. It's not too high

52:05.720 --> 52:07.720
I'm putting an air sounding, you know

52:07.760 --> 52:09.600
That one was really good and solid to me

52:09.600 --> 52:15.440
I mean something that if I really want to listen to substantial music I'd listen to that and so I'd give it about a

52:15.840 --> 52:17.120
nine

52:17.120 --> 52:19.120
Not attentive. It's not that touch of

52:19.800 --> 52:21.120
but

52:21.120 --> 52:23.120
It gets nice. Alrighty

52:23.360 --> 52:25.720
I'll go next. Um, I thought it was kind of cool

52:25.720 --> 52:30.820
It actually kind of reminded me just a little bit of some of the j-pop stuff you've been playing for me lately

52:30.820 --> 52:32.380
I think I can see why you like that one

52:32.380 --> 52:35.500
Just a little bit like it kind of sounds like a bit of that end flow a little bit

52:35.500 --> 52:40.460
I'm not so sure I dig the rapping, but I like the instrumentation quite a bit. So

52:41.500 --> 52:44.580
Seven and a half eight ish somewhere in there Jonas

52:45.640 --> 52:47.640
explicit, sorry

52:47.640 --> 52:49.140
Call me and eat some stuff.

52:49.140 --> 52:50.840
Um...

52:50.840 --> 52:52.640
Okay, okay, okay, no kidding.

52:52.640 --> 52:54.340
Okay, daddy.

52:54.340 --> 52:56.240
Okay, not everything, sorry.

52:56.240 --> 52:58.340
Anyways, I'll give it an 8 out of 10.

52:58.340 --> 52:59.540
Pretty good.

52:59.540 --> 53:00.740
I wouldn't give it, like, a 9 out of 10,

53:00.740 --> 53:03.540
because they have some flaws and stuff, but...

53:03.540 --> 53:08.240
It's not perfect, but it's pretty good for someone to listen to.

53:08.240 --> 53:10.940
All right. Angel?

53:10.940 --> 53:13.540
Good instrumental. I liked it in school.

53:13.540 --> 53:16.440
And you know what I mean by when I say instrumental, so...

53:16.440 --> 53:19.440
Um, probably Solid 8.

53:19.440 --> 53:21.440
Alright, Solid 8 from Angel.

53:21.440 --> 53:24.440
Secret and Rice Princess, do you guys have a comment on this one?

53:24.440 --> 53:26.440
On this song, bass and jam.

53:26.440 --> 53:28.440
We're doing Cage Match? I'm eating a cookie.

53:28.440 --> 53:30.440
So I give the cookie an 8.

53:30.440 --> 53:35.440
Alright, I'm not even going to ask Rice Princess what smartass thing she has to say.

53:35.440 --> 53:37.440
I'm just going to go to the next song, which is my song!

53:37.440 --> 53:42.440
And, um, as I promised last week, I am bringing in Danny Minogue this week.

53:42.440 --> 53:48.000
week, except this is not one of her songs. It's a song featuring Danny Minogue, so it's

53:48.000 --> 53:54.000
just her vocals. And actually, the artist is Riva, who did a really good remix of I.O.

53:54.000 --> 53:56.920
with Rapture. I don't know if you guys know that song, but if you know that song you heard

53:56.920 --> 54:00.960
in clubs, they did that remix. It's really awesome. So this is Riva, featuring Danny

54:00.960 --> 54:07.960
Minnow with who do you love now? Enjoy!

54:30.960 --> 54:40.960
When you toss it off your head, you're too far from perfection, perfection

54:40.960 --> 54:55.960
We're an empty world, we're an empty world

54:55.960 --> 54:59.960
And it's hard to break it, heaven

54:59.960 --> 55:02.960
We love you

55:02.960 --> 55:06.960
And it's hard to break it, heaven

55:06.960 --> 55:10.960
We love you

55:10.960 --> 55:13.960
We love you

55:13.960 --> 55:37.960
I know you're coming just for me I try to remember what I've been through

55:37.960 --> 55:42.960
Cause it goes along transfusions

55:42.960 --> 55:45.960
Cause it's down to gray I see

55:45.960 --> 55:51.960
How can life not seem so pretty, so pretty

55:51.960 --> 55:55.960
Fighting to breathe

55:55.960 --> 55:59.960
Fighting to breathe

55:59.960 --> 56:03.960
Fighting to breathe

56:03.960 --> 56:07.960
You're fighting to breathe

56:07.960 --> 56:11.960
And it's hard to break it, haven't

56:11.960 --> 56:14.960
Who do you love now?

56:14.960 --> 56:18.960
And it's hard to break it, haven't

56:18.960 --> 56:28.960
Who do you love now?

56:28.960 --> 56:56.960
And it's hard to break it, have it And it's hard to break it, have it

57:26.960 --> 57:37.180
All right, that was song number three in tonight's cage match.

57:37.180 --> 57:38.580
Reva featuring Danny Minogue.

57:38.580 --> 57:39.960
Who do you love now?

57:39.960 --> 57:42.540
Let's see if it was loved now or hated now.

57:42.540 --> 57:43.780
Dark Sakura.

57:43.780 --> 57:46.140
It's Trancy.

57:46.140 --> 57:50.820
And I like trance, but I've lately just been so burned on.

57:50.820 --> 57:51.820
Trancy Trancy.

57:51.820 --> 57:53.780
But it was really good.

57:53.780 --> 58:01.340
So, um, I'll give it a seven and a half to eight, so yeah, it was good, it was really,

58:01.340 --> 58:02.340
it was really solid.

58:02.340 --> 58:03.340
Alright.

58:03.340 --> 58:04.340
Sounds good.

58:04.340 --> 58:05.340
Uh, me voting.

58:05.340 --> 58:06.340
And her voice didn't annoy me this time.

58:06.340 --> 58:07.340
Me voting?

58:07.340 --> 58:08.340
I think it's great.

58:08.340 --> 58:09.340
I give it a nine.

58:09.340 --> 58:10.340
Enough said.

58:10.340 --> 58:11.340
Uh, Loki.

58:11.340 --> 58:12.340
Hi, my name's Danny Monod.

58:12.340 --> 58:16.660
I don't have an original bone in my body.

58:16.660 --> 58:18.660
She's basically Kylie Monod Two.

58:18.660 --> 58:23.760
I'm gonna take everything that she makes and make it my own, yeah!

58:23.760 --> 58:26.680
One thing you should know if you were paying attention to the chatroom, they're talking

58:26.680 --> 58:30.320
about how they took Kylie Minogue's leg, cut it off, and grew it in a giant nascent jar

58:30.320 --> 58:32.440
with toothpicks to grow Danny.

58:32.440 --> 58:36.440
Hey, that's cool, you know, if you wanted to do that to like, you know, some of the

58:36.440 --> 58:38.080
other hot chicks out there.

58:38.080 --> 58:39.080
I'd be down with that.

58:39.080 --> 58:41.800
That's all we need is hot clones.

58:41.800 --> 58:43.200
Screw cloning ugly people.

58:43.200 --> 58:48.160
Oh yeah, I give it a seven because it was eh.

58:48.160 --> 58:50.480
Uh, TDR Angel, what did you think of that one?

58:50.480 --> 58:51.480
I liked it, duh.

58:51.480 --> 58:53.480
I mean, we all know why, right?

58:53.480 --> 59:03.480
I guess I'll give it an 8. No, I'm not trying to copy myself from last time, I just thought that, yeah.

59:03.480 --> 59:11.480
Right, an 8 from Angel. Jonas? 8. 8, simply 8. Simply just sounds like the same, but still pretty good.

59:11.480 --> 59:18.480
Is anybody in the kitchen, Seeger, Rice Princess, and Linktail have a comment on that one?

59:18.480 --> 59:22.360
And they say hi, and we like the cookies all right fair enough

59:23.000 --> 59:27.600
All right, we got to do the voting fast tonight. So please think about your vote and

59:28.240 --> 59:33.020
We're going to play a quick recap of the three songs you can vote for tonight song number one last week's winner

59:33.240 --> 59:35.240
Not out phase with a new on

59:35.240 --> 59:59.560
Alright, song number two tonight, Basement Jax with Lucky Star.

59:59.560 --> 01:00:02.560
All right, song number three, Riva featuring Danny Minogue,

01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:03.560
Who Do You Love Now?

01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:07.560
The way I feel, how can my love feel?

01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:14.560
No feeling, no feeling, fighting to me.

01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:16.560
All right, those are the three songs.

01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:19.560
Place, vote now, and you only have a minute to vote,

01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:21.560
so please place your vote now.

01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:23.560
And we got to hurry up and get through this

01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:25.560
because I do want to open up guessing.

01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:27.560
Not yet, do not send guesses on the song yet,

01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:32.560
But I'm going to open it up as soon as Cage Match voting is over, so please hurry. Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.

01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:47.560
You know what that song sounded like, though? That Danny Minogue song? It sounded like that one, um, Atari Hikaru, uh, song, um, that was like, you know, Devil or some- Devil Inside, I don't know. What was that? One song? I don't remember the name.

01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:52.560
Oh, the one I played a couple weeks ago, the Devil Inside song? I'd bring it up, but it's going to take too much.

01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:56.560
It sounds just like that. It has the same beat to it.

01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:59.560
Well, maybe those are just songs I, uh, really enjoy this week, I don't know.

01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:02.560
Or maybe because Danny Minogue can't be original!

01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:09.560
I don't know, I don't know what to tell you. Uh, Seagurd, I hate, I hate to tear you away from the conversation, but I had a really good question come in.

01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:17.560
During, while the cage match was going on. Oh, I know. God, you mean you gotta come talk to Rob? God, he's gonna yell at me again.

01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:22.560
I completely understand. Okay, what are these people interrupting my conversation in the kitchen for?

01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:25.880
Alright, let's see, the question was...

01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:29.040
Who is it by? So I don't know if I'm actually going to address it.

01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:32.560
Cutris. Is that microphone going out?

01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:36.760
I don't know, is it? Probably. I'm just hearing a lot of static.

01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:40.320
Oh, it's the cords. Alright, careful guys.

01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:43.840
Was DDR involved at all in Konami's Friday

01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:47.240
press event? GameStop's coverage didn't have anything in it at all, even though it is

01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:47.800
covered

01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:51.160
in Karaoke Revolution Xbox, or I'm sorry, even though it did cover

01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:54.320
Karaoke Revolution Xbox and Karaoke Revolution 3.

01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:58.520
To my knowledge, I don't believe there's any DDR information,

01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:02.680
but you have to understand that we have lives on the weekend,

01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:05.920
and I didn't even know until today that there was a press event on,

01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:11.480
what, Friday? So, like, I first heard about that stupid Suikoden 4 pushback

01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:17.040
today, and as Rob can attest, I was kind of vocal and loud and angry about it,

01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:20.040
But yeah, I don't think anything was announced.

01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:29.040
Your best source of information will always be something you'll hear from the Vivid members on DDRFreak.

01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:33.040
And Orangeless.

01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:36.040
That microphone's going out, can we get some electric tape on that?

01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:39.040
God dammit! Stop breaking the damn mic!

01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:41.040
I'm gonna kill all you people!

01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:45.040
You keep replacing mics every week because you keep swinging them around!

01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:47.040
Or maybe he's spilling soda on them!

01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:49.040
I am microphone...

01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:52.040
If you guys are coming out completely on that microphone...

01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:55.040
I'm gonna go to...

01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:58.040
I'm gonna go to kind of like an emergency break here while we uh...

01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:01.040
Fix the microphone, so let's go to...

01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:05.040
Let's see, I'm gonna tally up the cage match votes here.

01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:07.040
Let's see, stop it.

01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:10.040
Let's go to...

01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:11.040
It works fine.

01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:13.040
No, see, you can hear it.

01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:19.980
you can hear it all right let's just go to err and we'll be back

01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:40.160
All right, we're back, and hopefully we have that microphone fixed.

01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:41.160
Not sure.

01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:44.160
you yelled at it and it works?

01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:47.160
who's got it now?

01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:49.160
why can't you people talk to her?

01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:51.160
see? it's not working right now

01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:54.160
woah! I pushed it in and it sounds like it's working now

01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:56.160
see? I told you something was going on there

01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:58.160
it's because it doesn't like her, it likes me

01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:01.160
this microphone likes me, just see, look, it's working just fine now

01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:04.160
cause I used my secret woman power on it

01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:07.160
and now it works

01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:08.160
alright

01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:11.440
Use the power of estrogen on this microphone

01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:15.880
The power of estrogen compels me I

01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:20.880
Need a young priest in an old priest. All right, I need some split pea soup

01:05:21.180 --> 01:05:24.420
I'm getting the last few votes for cage match titled

01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:28.920
It's too late to submit a vote a lot of votes for that song coming in at the last minute

01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:33.880

this week's cage match once again not out phase with new on a lot of votes

01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:56.060
talk about some other Bomani news that came up this week and let's see that

01:06:56.060 --> 01:07:00.200
news would be about the all the Bomani games that were announced for earlier

01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:06.020
this week such as pop and music 10 is coming out November 18th also coming out

01:07:06.020 --> 01:07:11.300
November 18th 8th style 2d x8 style will be out for the home versions so this is

01:07:11.300 --> 01:07:16.300
some big news. We get two Bimani games in one day. Also announced initially was this

01:07:16.300 --> 01:07:23.060
new thing called DDR Festival. It was something called DDR Festival, but then Konami pulled

01:07:23.060 --> 01:07:33.260
it off their page, but... What, Seagurd? Seagurd, come here and tell us about this.

01:07:33.260 --> 01:07:50.260
I don't know why people are like, oh, they took it down, it's not real. It's a real game.

01:07:50.260 --> 01:07:53.260
People are taking pre-orders for it. Shut up.

01:07:53.260 --> 01:07:57.260
Is there anything you can tell us about DDR Festival?

01:07:57.260 --> 01:08:00.260
Not really. Festival.

01:08:00.260 --> 01:08:09.260
No, not really. I know a little bit of stuff, but nothing I can actually say.

01:08:09.260 --> 01:08:18.260
Alright, nothing you can actually say, that's fine. Alright, anything you've heard about the pop music and the 8 style stuff?

01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:27.260
That's all, like, Konami of Japan stuff, and, you know, it's all taken care of over there, so.

01:08:27.260 --> 01:08:29.260
Alright.

01:08:29.260 --> 01:08:33.260
If it comes through our offices, though, you won't hear about it till it comes out.

01:08:33.260 --> 01:08:37.260
Because it'd be, like, a huge thing, probably.

01:08:37.260 --> 01:08:44.260
Alright, so, what was your guys' reaction? Because I know that there's been a lot of, like, kind of question, like,

01:08:44.260 --> 01:08:49.220
like when's 10th pop music 10 gonna be announced because I even know that Navi our

01:08:49.220 --> 01:08:51.820
resident pop music horror was here a couple weeks ago and he was kind of like

01:08:51.820 --> 01:08:55.860
what usually about now would be when they're announcing pop in town but they

01:08:55.860 --> 01:08:59.500
haven't yet and then to kind of get eight style without a two-year wait

01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:04.260
like we felt like we had last time. Konami had huge success with seven style

01:09:04.260 --> 01:09:09.420
so obviously it made sense them to bring out eight. As for pop music if you're

01:09:09.420 --> 01:09:13.060
worried about that going away anytime soon just look at the arcade one it's

01:09:13.060 --> 01:09:18.060
It's like on, you know, Popping Music 387, since they came out daily, pretty much.

01:09:18.060 --> 01:09:22.060
D.E.R. was a surprise, though, that's for sure.

01:09:22.060 --> 01:09:23.060
Yeah.

01:09:23.060 --> 01:09:24.060
It's Japan.

01:09:24.060 --> 01:09:27.060
But, well, I guess you probably can't say if there's any truth to the iToy thing or

01:09:27.060 --> 01:09:28.700
not, but I know that's a rumor that's going around.

01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:29.700
That is a rumor indeed.

01:09:29.700 --> 01:09:30.700
All right.

01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:31.700
But you can neither confirm or deny it.

01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:32.700
That's fine.

01:09:32.700 --> 01:09:33.700
No.

01:09:33.700 --> 01:09:34.700
All right.

01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:38.900
So, what about, like, I know you said this before on the show, something about 2DX8 style

01:09:38.900 --> 01:09:42.940
coming out was the biggest thing for you, and now here's the news, November 18th.

01:09:42.940 --> 01:09:52.940
7th Style, I really like the soundtrack a lot, because to me that's the Kiryamoka soundtrack, you know, it's got the most Kiryamoka tunes as any soundtrack.

01:09:52.940 --> 01:10:01.940
Oh yeah, 5th, it's got a lot too, but every single Kiryamoka song on 7th is my favorite, which is kind of weird, 3 songs being my favorite, but whatever.

01:10:01.940 --> 01:10:15.940
So I like 7th Style, but I hated the, you know, obviously the price tag is way too high, and the whole, like, the whole problems we had to go through just to get it, you know, going on the Japanese site and getting fake, you know, information just to get them to send it here.

01:10:15.940 --> 01:10:28.940
So then when I heard about this coming out, I was just like, wow, awesome, because 8th Style is definitely my favorite soundtrack, period. I mean, just, I can listen to the 8th Style soundtrack from beginning to end, and there's probably only one song on there I don't like, Monkey Dance. Anyway.

01:10:28.940 --> 01:10:30.940
I love Monkey Dance, you shut up.

01:10:30.940 --> 01:10:32.940
Yeah, I bet you love Monkey Dance, you monkey lover.

01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:33.940
Shut up.

01:10:33.940 --> 01:10:38.940
But yeah, so that's awesome. I just hope it means that they'll continue to make these games for home versions, because I'd like to see 9th style.

01:10:38.940 --> 01:10:44.940
You know, I'd love to play a 9th style and a 10th style that doesn't have a fucking lag or timing issue, you know?

01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:47.940
So, hopefully they'll continue to make them.

01:10:47.940 --> 01:10:55.940
I mean, even if they're not going to keep making DDR stuff, Japanese DDR games, then hey, 2DX is my original love anyway.

01:10:55.940 --> 01:10:56.940
Alright.

01:10:56.940 --> 01:10:57.940
Or BeatMania, whatever.

01:10:57.940 --> 01:11:01.940
Anybody else have anything they want to say on Pop'n Music 10 or 2DX8 style?

01:11:01.940 --> 01:11:03.940
Angel's coming up to say something.

01:11:03.940 --> 01:11:05.940
Gotta make my order, you know.

01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:09.940
I am going to be so broke between all the games in the U.S. coming out.

01:11:09.940 --> 01:11:12.940
Oh God, I just want to scream. It's so horrible.

01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:15.940
I mean, it's great, but at the same time my bank account is crying.

01:11:15.940 --> 01:11:17.940
Angel.

01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:20.940
Hey, here goes the mic again. Oh, never mind. I can't hear myself. Yay!

01:11:20.940 --> 01:11:23.540
uh... yes so

01:11:23.540 --> 01:11:27.320
i am definitely going to buy a txt and

01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:29.120
public and

01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:32.520
uh... hopefully the orange it's on

01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:36.380
txt because yeah it's orange

01:11:36.380 --> 01:11:38.780
i was trying to make a pun there but i guess it just did

01:11:38.780 --> 01:11:42.740
and uh... ten hoping to hang out there

01:11:42.740 --> 01:11:43.500
okay there

01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:45.780
uh... probably ten obviously uh...

01:11:45.780 --> 01:11:47.540
jenny's cuz katie's cool

01:11:47.540 --> 01:11:49.580
uses

01:11:49.580 --> 01:11:54.580
I think we're going to go to, oh, I wanted to do some more, um, song guesses real fast.

01:11:54.580 --> 01:11:56.580
Can somebody tell Seagurd to come in real fast?

01:11:56.580 --> 01:12:00.580
Tell Seagurd to come in real fast. They went outside to have a smoke or something.

01:12:04.580 --> 01:12:06.580
Sorry, I got more guesses.

01:12:09.580 --> 01:12:12.580
Alright, here we go. More guesses, Seagurd.

01:12:12.580 --> 01:12:13.580
Okay.

01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:16.580
Alright, voting is, er, your guest time is closed for right now.

01:12:16.580 --> 01:12:23.860
Um, let's see. White Rob says, um, Giluami tell.

01:12:23.860 --> 01:12:28.060
Well, well, that's not what they said.

01:12:28.060 --> 01:12:32.660
But Jamie, I'm just saying what they said. Okay, Jamie says William tell.

01:12:32.660 --> 01:12:36.260
No. It's not in any way. Oh, I get it. It's French. Well, I'm too,

01:12:36.260 --> 01:12:41.700
you know, honky. Not French. Alright. That was some good reasoning, though.

01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:45.140
What was the reasoning? Um, because something about,

01:12:45.140 --> 01:12:48.820
he said something about tattletales and then something about the galloping was

01:12:48.820 --> 01:12:50.140
supposed to symbolize the

01:12:50.140 --> 01:12:53.940
William Tell overture, because Tell, I don't know. Okay. I mean, you know,

01:12:53.940 --> 01:12:57.660
you can come up with good reasoning and I'll give you, you know, a thumbs up for that, but it's still wrong.

01:12:57.660 --> 01:13:00.900
MJSI24 says, across the nightmare. No.

01:13:00.900 --> 01:13:05.020
No reasoning also, so even if it was right, I wouldn't tell you.

01:13:05.020 --> 01:13:09.980
And then we have, uh, let's see...

01:13:09.980 --> 01:13:14.980
Cabut says, bad girls by Julia Roberts just because of that

01:13:14.980 --> 01:13:20.220
quote we played earlier. No. No. Alright. But hey, you gave reasoning. That's good.

01:13:20.220 --> 01:13:25.620
I guess we'll have to do another hint somewhat soon. Yeah. Alright. We're going to take a

01:13:25.620 --> 01:13:29.540
break and we'll be back to talk about more stuff. Maybe we'll get into the FUs of the

01:13:29.540 --> 01:13:33.420
week pretty soon. That sounds like an idea to me. We're going to get into the FUs of

01:13:33.420 --> 01:13:38.880
the week when we come back so you can send FUs to Sky in the chat room after this break

01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:45.880
featuring music from Poppin' Music 10 and 2DX8 style. We'll be back.

01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:45.880
Alright, uh, we had more we wanted to play, but Seagurd, you had something you wanted to ask me about.

01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:46.880
Yeah, you know that...

01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:48.880
Wait, use my microphone.

01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:52.880
You know that game show back in the day, that Let's Make a Deal?

01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:54.880
Yeah, I've heard of that show.

01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:58.880
Remember when they would pick the wrong curtain and that funny thing would happen?

01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:03.880
Like, yeah, yeah, yeah, the goat and stuff? Yeah, that was great.

01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:06.880
Yes, yes, I think so too.

01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:08.480
It was clue-a-riffic.

01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:15.480
I think so too.

01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:40.480
You

01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:35.480
Are you ready to dance through the night?

01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:38.480
Begging the root of my heart, it was right there

01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:41.480
Should you read your magic?

01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:44.480
Under the moonlight

01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:47.480
Bounds of light, the bloody feet of

01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:50.480
Love what's me, I don't know why

01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:52.480
Do you understand this move?

01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:56.480
From the hell that God is watching me?

01:18:56.480 --> 01:18:59.480
Monkey dance, monkey dance

01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:00.480
Like a star

01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:02.480
Shake your body down

01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:04.480
Move your body down, step on the monkey down

01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:09.480
Let's get together, hold on for your baby

01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:13.480
Monkey dance, monkey dance, let me share

01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:17.480
Move your body down, step on the monkey down

01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:23.480
Look at this building, do the razzle-doo tonight

01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:53.240
For some reason, it's come to my attention that not everybody may have picked up what

01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:58.100
Secret and I were talking about there before that song, so can we grab Secret again real

01:19:58.100 --> 01:20:02.280
fast? Tell him I'm really sorry, but for some reason, some people didn't hear it, so we'll

01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:08.420
do it one more time. Secret, I'm sorry. For some reason, people couldn't hear what you

01:20:08.420 --> 01:20:11.340
were asking me about. I have no idea what the hell's going on, but some people missed

01:20:11.340 --> 01:20:16.140
it, so again, we'll use my mic here. You wanted to ask me about something during this break.

01:20:16.140 --> 01:20:20.960
It's not going to be as cool this time, but hey, you know that show, that game show, Let's

01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:21.960
Make a Deal?

01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:25.800
Yes, I still remember that show, that's the one where they dress up and shit, right?

01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:30.160
Yeah, wasn't it, or do you remember that thing, you know, when they picked the wrong door

01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:31.420
or curtain?

01:20:31.420 --> 01:20:33.440
I do remember that with the goats and stuff.

01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:36.200
Yeah, that was awesome, wasn't it?

01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:42.480
Why, yes, I think it was, and I think it's really great that you're asking me about it.

01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:49.480
Isn't it clue-rific or hint-tastic?

01:22:42.480 --> 01:23:11.480
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

01:23:11.480 --> 01:23:19.980
We are back, and some of you guys are probably doing a little bit of research right now.

01:23:19.980 --> 01:23:25.980
I'm very interested in some of the stuff I'm reading in the chatroom. Very interesting theories going on there.

01:23:25.980 --> 01:23:30.980
So I can't wait to open it up to do another round of guesses, because I think maybe somebody could get it this time.

01:23:30.980 --> 01:23:36.980
I think other people are just thinking we are completely smoking crack, which wouldn't be too far from the truth, actually.

01:23:36.980 --> 01:23:46.980
And you know, if you read the Extreme Thread, we like to throw out stuff that doesn't make any sense, or might not be a clue.

01:23:46.980 --> 01:23:52.980
This is actually an honest-to-goodness clue, I'll say that right now, so if you're thinking we're just blowing smoke up, nah, we're not.

01:23:52.980 --> 01:23:58.980
If somebody gets the song tonight, so we actually get to play the song, then we will explain all the clues as well.

01:23:58.980 --> 01:24:04.980
And you're gonna hit yourself, or not, or you'll still think we smoke crack, which is fine. You can go ahead and think that. Screw you.

01:24:04.980 --> 01:24:09.900
screw you alright so now we're gonna get into tonight's F use of the week I

01:24:09.900 --> 01:24:15.060
advise you though that if you send your F you via the chat room it better be good

01:24:15.060 --> 01:24:18.000
or it may not be read because there's a lot of people in the shower tonight we

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:22.680
are only gonna have to be selective in reading chat room F use tonight so Jamie

01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:28.140
though this is your baby right the F use of the week and why why do we love the

01:24:28.140 --> 01:24:32.040
F use of the week and I can't hear you but you go that mic thing I have to have

01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:39.040
an outlet somehow. Alright, here we go.

01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:56.780
My first F.U. goes towards the great amount of roadkill I saw on Madison. Lots and lots

01:24:56.780 --> 01:25:03.780
and lots of roadkill. Seriously, I like passed by like, at least six dead squirrels. One

01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:08.880
of them looked like missing a head, it was gross. And then there was this big pile of

01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:15.880
blood and gore. I'm so glad the chatroom could not hear what you just said. I remember one

01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:25.720
time though, coming up here, I uh, I couldn't, by the way to Cutress, I can't read private

01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:31.640
I can't read private messages since I'm on the main cabinet, so I'm not at home.

01:25:31.640 --> 01:25:34.040
So, don't send me any private messages, please.

01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:35.040
Sorry.

01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:38.520
If you want to send me a message to get it later, just send me on Dr. Sakura SSF, but

01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:41.520
I'll read it when I get home.

01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:49.960
Anyway, a big SU to sinuses and allergies for totally just screwing with my head today.

01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:53.440
I'm on so much medication that it's not even funny.

01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:59.100
like my poor cat she's like mama love me and she gets in my lap and I'm like get

01:25:59.100 --> 01:26:04.180
out of my lap you're shedding in my nose. So I had to push her off and then a big

01:26:04.180 --> 01:26:08.620
epi to people who tailgate me when like people are going 15 miles under the

01:26:08.620 --> 01:26:12.660
speed limit in front of me and there's nobody in front of them and like I

01:26:12.660 --> 01:26:17.620
couldn't change lanes because I was like a block away from here it would have

01:26:17.620 --> 01:26:21.820
been pointless to change us and then like the guy suddenly turns I'm like you ass so I

01:26:21.820 --> 01:26:29.500
I was just completely pissed off and also and this is not like a true f you because I adore my fiance

01:26:30.220 --> 01:26:33.900
but when I don't want to be touched stop trying to hold my hand I

01:26:35.260 --> 01:26:41.860
Would I say and go if I'm here messing and I don't want you to hold my hand or be lovey. Don't do it

01:26:42.340 --> 01:26:46.020
Get get my clue. Don't do it. Give woman space, please

01:26:47.460 --> 01:26:49.060
and

01:26:49.060 --> 01:26:56.060
And then, I don't know, I sort of lost my thunder there for a little bit, so...

01:26:56.060 --> 01:26:57.060
I'm sorry.

01:26:57.060 --> 01:27:02.060
That's really got on my nerves, I'm sitting here, I'm trying to drink my Pepsi at breakfast,

01:27:02.060 --> 01:27:08.060
and like, I'm so tired and aggravated and everything, and Dan's like,

01:27:08.060 --> 01:27:10.060
I want to hold your hand.

01:27:10.060 --> 01:27:17.060
And also, F-you to people who called during the show, don't call the home line during the show.

01:27:17.060 --> 01:27:19.060
Unless you don't know the show exists, then you're forgiven.

01:27:21.060 --> 01:27:23.060
Okay, I guess that was a good one.

01:27:25.060 --> 01:27:26.060
Alright.

01:27:26.060 --> 01:27:35.060
Also, um, F you to having to install more crap on my computer when my computer space is supposed to be taken up by Stargate episodes.

01:27:36.060 --> 01:27:37.060
Okay, so bye.

01:27:38.060 --> 01:27:40.060

that's like drinking water actually it's like drinking rancid water

01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:52.380
i'd rather drink rancid water before a diet crap

01:28:52.380 --> 01:28:55.440
and diet

01:28:55.440 --> 01:28:58.060

01:28:58.060 --> 01:28:59.400
i gotta go see this truck

01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:01.200
cause it's on fire

01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:02.960
we have a update

01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:04.160
loki's

01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:07.840
wait loki can we talk to loki's sister here real fast?

01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:12.860
yeah that's why I was hold on a minute are we all stuck here right now you

01:29:12.860 --> 01:29:17.080
guys can't leave the big rig is across the entire road going eastbound or

01:29:17.080 --> 01:29:19.960
whatever direction that is no cars are moving everybody's turn around going

01:29:19.960 --> 01:29:28.840
back to Granite Bay so everybody Jamie Jamie wants the digit cam to go take

01:29:28.840 --> 01:29:32.940
pictures we're gonna go to a quick break while we figure out what the hell is

01:29:32.940 --> 01:29:37.820
going on in the F use to be continued in just a little bit guys sorry for the

01:29:37.820 --> 01:29:39.700
delay, but there's a little bit of chaos.

01:29:39.700 --> 01:29:42.540
Again, we are all stuck here at Orange Lawn's radio.

01:29:42.540 --> 01:29:45.700
We are not allowed to leave because there is a jackknife

01:29:45.700 --> 01:29:46.380
truck outside.

01:29:46.380 --> 01:29:47.380
We'll be back.

01:33:16.380 --> 01:33:29.740
Alright, we are back and if you missed what the hell's going on, basically there's been

01:33:29.740 --> 01:33:36.460
a giant accident on a main, we live on a very major artery that connects two towns together

01:33:36.460 --> 01:33:40.220
and there's been a truck that looks like it was carrying new vehicles or something on

01:33:40.220 --> 01:33:46.760
it that kind of is jackknife its way across the whole road. So, no cars can cross this

01:33:46.760 --> 01:33:50.600
road right now, which means that for a lot of the folks here at the studio, if they have

01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:52.980
rides coming in or something, they're not going to be able to get here unless they know

01:33:52.980 --> 01:33:57.580
to come a big back way around. So, it's going to be very interesting. So, sorry about that

01:33:57.580 --> 01:34:02.820
guys but that was very interesting because we thought for a moment we were stuck here

01:34:02.820 --> 01:34:05.660
if there was a big fire, but it doesn't look like it's flaming or there's a fire going

01:34:05.660 --> 01:34:14.660
But Jamie did run out there with my camera, and uh, Loki's out there too. We are gonna continue the show, uh, and doing the FUs of the week.

01:34:14.660 --> 01:34:21.660
So, yeah, so we still got Seagurd here in Rise Princess because you guys already saw the accident. Did you hear it?

01:34:21.660 --> 01:34:29.660
Well, I didn't hear it. No, I didn't even hear it. I was inside when it happened. Um, but I went out there, and they told me about it, and I was like,

01:34:29.660 --> 01:34:33.740
like well I'm sad for the person who's in the accident but I'm not gonna go

01:34:33.740 --> 01:34:38.900
right out and see it weird very weird all right let's move on with the FUs of

01:34:38.900 --> 01:34:50.060
the week shall we it was my turn when we left off my FU of the week goes to that

01:34:50.060 --> 01:34:55.280
accident going on out there and taking away from the show that was crazy yeah

01:34:55.280 --> 01:35:01.080
was too crowded in here anyway though so that's a good point. Also just a big

01:35:01.080 --> 01:35:06.920
f-you to me falling asleep while driving yesterday. Not really though.

01:35:06.920 --> 01:35:14.480
Wait, Jamie's back? Hold on let me get this now that Jamie is interrupting my

01:35:14.480 --> 01:35:18.080
f-yous that's all right all right Jamie what were you saying? That was the most

01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:22.480
goddamn boring accent I've ever saw and it's some stupid car driver's fault. They

01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:24.700
I ran into the truck.

01:35:24.700 --> 01:35:30.200
Okay, now I don't... now normally, okay, you might say, okay, I don't understand how you didn't see that car.

01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:32.820
Or, I don't understand how you didn't see that truck.

01:35:32.820 --> 01:35:34.920
How about I don't know how you didn't see that truck

01:35:34.920 --> 01:35:37.580
carrying a bunch of boats?

01:35:37.580 --> 01:35:40.080
I mean, this thing is like a gigantic...

01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:41.800
Yeah, okay, this thing is carrying about...

01:35:41.800 --> 01:35:44.120
It's about tw... imagine a like

01:35:44.120 --> 01:35:50.040
twelve foot tall wall that spans about thirty feet long. How do you miss that?

01:35:50.040 --> 01:35:52.060
While driving down the road.

01:35:52.060 --> 01:35:57.060
I didn't think it was funny that for once, this show wasn't the only wreck.

01:35:57.060 --> 01:35:59.060
Shut up.

01:35:59.060 --> 01:36:02.060
FU to Brad for that comment, you're a fucktard.

01:36:02.060 --> 01:36:04.060
Alright.

01:36:04.060 --> 01:36:08.060
Let's go on and hear from other folks in our studio, their FUs of the Week.

01:36:08.060 --> 01:36:10.060
Starting with Lanky Stiles, since he has a microphone.

01:36:10.060 --> 01:36:17.060
The FU goes to the proprietors of the house I'm living in, because now I have to go find a job very quickly and a new apartment.

01:36:17.060 --> 01:36:19.060
Yay!

01:36:19.060 --> 01:36:29.060
And I know it's very unlikely they could be listening to this show, but it's also possible they could be. I don't fucking care what you think. So, there you go.

01:36:29.060 --> 01:36:34.060
Alright, very interesting. Okay, Jonas, do you have any FUs you want to give out?

01:36:34.060 --> 01:36:44.060
Okay, everyone probably said about the F.U., about the car wreck.

01:36:44.060 --> 01:36:47.060
God, drivers, drive safely.

01:36:47.060 --> 01:36:51.060
I don't have to keep mentioning this so many times.

01:36:51.060 --> 01:36:54.060
No fucking color on that.

01:36:54.060 --> 01:37:01.060
Okay, F.U. to the server that I'm hosting my sims and my database on, it keeps shutting down, dammit.

01:37:01.060 --> 01:37:08.060
And, and people quit hacking on it and quit hitting too much bandwidth, sorry, killing my bandwidth.

01:37:08.060 --> 01:37:11.060
You know this is free for me, so...

01:37:11.060 --> 01:37:18.060
Okay, and F you to my current manager right now for not giving me a damn raise.

01:37:18.060 --> 01:37:26.060
Okay, I'm doing stuff that people would get paid, like, a shitload, and I'm just here getting minimum wage for now.

01:37:26.060 --> 01:37:31.260
And for the love of God, I'm helping you at the arcade try to get better a little bit,

01:37:31.260 --> 01:37:33.780
bring more business towards it.

01:37:33.780 --> 01:37:39.660
Another F goes to my former manager for getting two people to quit the job that I'm working

01:37:39.660 --> 01:37:40.660
at.

01:37:40.660 --> 01:37:41.660
Thanks a lot.

01:37:41.660 --> 01:37:47.980
You're accusing people of stuff that they didn't even do.

01:37:47.980 --> 01:37:54.240
You jumped into conclusions immediately saying, oh, you caused a complaint.

01:37:54.240 --> 01:37:56.340
you should not do this again

01:37:56.340 --> 01:37:57.480
i guess what you just

01:37:57.480 --> 01:37:59.660
they left

01:37:59.660 --> 01:38:00.800
thanks a lot

01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:03.320
okay and another f he goes to one of our

01:38:03.320 --> 01:38:06.520
former co-workers who quit

01:38:06.520 --> 01:38:09.960
immediately after some big incident that just occurred

01:38:09.960 --> 01:38:11.000
thanks a lot

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.360
the little kid who's twelve years old

01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:16.020
can no longer move, he is paralyzed

01:38:16.020 --> 01:38:17.920
cause you didn't watch his ass

01:38:17.920 --> 01:38:20.820
on the rock climbing

01:38:20.820 --> 01:38:24.540
It's funny that kids don't know what the hell to do.

01:38:24.540 --> 01:38:26.820
Now it's gonna cost them, now we're gonna get sued.

01:38:26.820 --> 01:38:31.600
And if it goes out of business, where the hell are people gonna play DDR now?

01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:33.920
Just think about it. RVL's dead,

01:38:33.920 --> 01:38:37.680
Scandia's dead, Paradox On is the only place that people actually play DDR.

01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:41.600
FU to Paradise Island because I tried to go there today to check it out and the state fair is going on.

01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:47.520
Another FU there for the cars being so fucking expensive, the parking.

01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:49.600
Six bucks and stuff.

01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:53.800
Or seven.

01:38:53.800 --> 01:38:58.120
Well, CCL is somewhat okay, but I don't like the car system.

01:38:58.120 --> 01:39:00.320
Anyway, sorry to interrupt, anyway.

01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:02.280
Anything else?

01:39:02.280 --> 01:39:03.960
Uh...

01:39:03.960 --> 01:39:08.100
F-U for time going fast. I thought that vacation was still like one month.

01:39:08.100 --> 01:39:10.840
I'm now realizing that school is about to start soon.

01:39:10.840 --> 01:39:12.880
Starting tomorrow.

01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:15.080
I actually started school last week, sorry.

01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:18.720
But still, time goes too fast.

01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:20.680
I don't have any other chance.

01:39:20.680 --> 01:39:23.160
I've not got time for any vacation.

01:39:23.160 --> 01:39:25.320
Uh...

01:39:25.320 --> 01:39:26.720
F you for birds...

01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:30.240
More birds shitting in my car.

01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:33.040
Every time I clean my car, you all shit on it.

01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:33.840
I should just...

01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:40.080
Get a gun, shoot the fuck out of all those birds.

01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:41.200
Alright, anything else?

01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:45.360
we have a lot of all i have to be continued angel

01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:47.880
all right uh...

01:39:47.880 --> 01:39:52.080
away from the good like that

01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:54.120
uh... at you too

01:39:54.120 --> 01:39:55.280
the accident

01:39:55.280 --> 01:40:01.280
when we get home now

01:40:01.280 --> 01:40:03.000
uh...

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:06.800
and useful turning but if you can

01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:13.800
maybe I can graduate and what was I going to say? I forgot what it was. Oh well. I forgot

01:40:13.800 --> 01:40:17.800
what my F.U. was. Dammit. The really good ones that I needed to sit in the wall.

01:40:17.800 --> 01:40:20.800
There was no people? Ah, what the hell.

01:40:20.800 --> 01:40:28.800
Alright, let's move on to the chatroom F.U. is going to keep going here because I want to get another chance to guess for the clue because the accent kind of screwed us up and we're a little bit behind.

01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:32.800
So let's get to chatroom F.U. is here. I'm going to pick some good ones here.

01:40:32.800 --> 01:40:35.860
Esko says f you to the stupidest group of music fans on the earth

01:40:36.660 --> 01:40:41.580
See now that I work at a rock and roll merchandise place to see a whole variety of music fans from the stock stanky

01:40:41.740 --> 01:40:45.540
Slackers to the frat kids who all buy five feet tall Bob Marley posters

01:40:45.540 --> 01:40:47.180
But only a few really get on my nerves

01:40:47.180 --> 01:40:52.840
One has the exceptional ability to be racially offensive and moronic all the same time that is of course the juggalos

01:40:53.140 --> 01:40:59.740
ICP fans if you didn't know we recently had a guy called anybody killer who is apparently a member of their running crew to assigning in

01:40:59.740 --> 01:41:03.900
mall. It was like a wave of stupidity engulfed the entire mall, rich teen speaking ghetto

01:41:03.900 --> 01:41:07.460
and putting face paint on, attempting to blend into a culture that was originally inspired

01:41:07.460 --> 01:41:15.100
by the sins of their parents' greed. And they steal our shit and they're annoying, um, I

01:41:15.100 --> 01:41:20.340
don't even know what he's trying to say with that last bit there. Uh, moving on. John Fields

01:41:20.340 --> 01:41:24.380
says, F you to not having a job. F you to Divix for their weird new compression that's

01:41:24.380 --> 01:41:29.260
worthless. Videos that used to be 100 megs total are ending up as a gig on 5.2. Where's

01:41:29.260 --> 01:41:34.260
Here's my downgrade. F you again to Microsoft for releasing XP2. It sucks.

01:41:34.260 --> 01:41:37.260
Moving on.

01:41:37.260 --> 01:41:46.260
Karma Titan says, uh...

01:41:46.260 --> 01:41:54.260
F you to Carmel Mountain Nickel City Arcade, riving off Konami's DDR machines by using StepMania and charging people on StepMania.

01:41:54.260 --> 01:41:58.260
So what? It's fucking better than DDR. Get a look.

01:41:58.260 --> 01:42:06.560
I mean, unless they're putting shitty-ass step files in there, which I can understand that, but, you know, the step menu itself is just another fucking game.

01:42:06.560 --> 01:42:11.560
Just get used to it, man. At least it's not some Korean knockoff or something like that.

01:42:11.560 --> 01:42:16.560
At least you don't have no fucking Technomotion shit in there. Or like, you know, I can boogie.

01:42:18.560 --> 01:42:20.360
Alright, now moving on. Moo says,

01:42:20.360 --> 01:42:26.680
an F.U. of your own for Comcast? How could I forget? Thank you, Moo. I agree. A big F.U.

01:42:26.680 --> 01:42:33.780
to Comcast. Alright. Unknown Gamer says, a big ol' fuck you to people who don't pay me

01:42:33.780 --> 01:42:40.280
my goddamn money back. Pay me back, Mom, or it's your ass. See, I liked that one. That

01:42:40.280 --> 01:42:44.620
was a funny one. Alright, MJB says, my F.U. of the week goes to my friends for taking

01:42:44.620 --> 01:42:51.520
my PC and making me go on a Mac. Oh boo hoo. Cutress says, F you Orange Lounge for pwning

01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:55.740
me twice on my first listen on Orange Lounge Radio. Please make sure you hat trick me.

01:42:55.740 --> 01:43:02.040
I want one more pwnage before the end of the night. We still love you. No, pwn him. I hate

01:43:02.040 --> 01:43:08.840
the fact that I'm saying pwn, but he did say PWM. I'll wait until I get to Mobile. Yeah,

01:43:08.840 --> 01:43:13.040
we still have an hour left. Alright. You'll have to come hang out with me at the Aladdin

01:43:13.040 --> 01:43:22.040
He also says F.U. to double amputees who can dance better than me.

01:43:22.040 --> 01:43:28.040
Misty says an F.U. to myself for hurting myself while playing DDR today, but I did end up getting quite a few new double A's.

01:43:28.040 --> 01:43:31.040
Better yet, F.U. to school.

01:43:31.040 --> 01:43:36.040
And Panda says F.U. to losing the bid on eBay for about three gigs of RAM.

01:43:36.040 --> 01:43:38.040
That's a lot.

01:43:38.040 --> 01:43:42.040
And, uh, that's it for the FUs of the Week.

01:43:42.040 --> 01:43:46.040
Oh, Angel remembered her last one. Yes.

01:43:46.040 --> 01:43:50.040
FU to dial up, because, um, we still have it.

01:43:50.040 --> 01:43:54.040
And I need to get rid of that soon, so I'm gonna fix it this week. Maybe I can get high speed. Yay.

01:43:54.040 --> 01:43:58.040
There we go.

01:43:58.040 --> 01:44:02.040
Alright, that's it for the FUs of the Week.

01:44:02.040 --> 01:44:06.040
Alright, um, now what we're gonna do,

01:44:06.040 --> 01:44:10.020
I want to talk about karaoke revolution those big announcements that came out this week however

01:44:10.800 --> 01:44:16.720
We're opening it up. Send me a private message if you have a song guess we've given you three clues now

01:44:16.720 --> 01:44:19.820

Send it in over private message, and if you're the first one to get it right you get to announce it to everybody

So here's your chance all right meanwhile. I want to talk about this news story that came up this week and

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:35.820
And actually, just very recently, it was posted over on our website,

01:44:35.820 --> 01:44:42.460
orangelaunchradio.com, by our always really good news updater, Dark Tetsuya.

01:44:42.460 --> 01:44:43.460
He says that I get...

01:44:43.460 --> 01:44:44.460
What?

01:44:44.460 --> 01:44:53.100
You know what, I had to cut and trim some of the FUs tonight, so sorry.

01:44:53.100 --> 01:44:57.580
Plus, some folks got them in late, so sorry.

01:44:57.580 --> 01:45:00.580

01:45:34.740 --> 01:45:43.940

01:47:15.260 --> 01:47:21.020
what was that you're the one I want I know that would make Nellie happy it is

01:47:21.020 --> 01:47:30.180
hey wait a second that is on the first one repeat shenanigans I call

01:47:30.180 --> 01:47:37.180
shenanigans. Alright. Does that mean that the Bimani police are going to come out and beat ROC with a broom?

01:47:44.540 --> 01:47:50.380
What do you think about this Karaoke Revolution Volume 3? The franchise expanding some more, it sounds like. What do you guys think about this?

01:47:50.380 --> 01:47:54.740
I want my Xbox version.

01:47:54.740 --> 01:47:57.980
I could really sort of care less about the PS2.

01:47:57.980 --> 01:48:02.700
I mean, not that I could care less about it, but now that there's gonna be an Xbox one,

01:48:02.700 --> 01:48:10.860
I would rather have it on Xbox than PS2, because PS2 games are overall more of a disappointment

01:48:10.860 --> 01:48:17.320
than the same game on the Xbox.

01:48:17.320 --> 01:48:19.660
I love my Xbox.

01:48:19.660 --> 01:48:22.700
My addict box.

01:48:22.700 --> 01:48:25.540
I newly acquired Thug today.

01:48:25.540 --> 01:48:27.500
I can't wait to play it.

01:48:27.500 --> 01:48:30.780
Doug. Tony Hawk Underground. Oh! Cool.

01:48:30.780 --> 01:48:34.060
I had that. Yeah, I'm renting it and I'm gonna copy it.

01:48:34.060 --> 01:48:37.940
Cause I'm a copier. I have mine now.

01:48:37.940 --> 01:48:41.700
My uh, HD loader. HD loader fucking rocks.

01:48:41.700 --> 01:48:44.900
We have the ESPN football game on it, Jen's been playing that.

01:48:44.900 --> 01:48:48.900
Yeah. See, Driver 3's awesome, cause you know,

01:48:48.900 --> 01:48:52.100
it's, I paid five bucks. If you want crap. Five bucks to get it

01:48:52.100 --> 01:49:00.700
that's all that was worth all right let's see no Z no Z let's can we get

01:49:00.700 --> 01:49:12.940
Seager back in here for the latest clue round up here what's going on all right

01:49:12.940 --> 01:49:19.180
hi everybody we're gonna go through the clues okay yeah yeah all right here we

01:49:19.180 --> 01:49:25.180
Here we go. Here we go. Let's see. We had KarmaTitan submit a guess for Armageddon.

01:49:25.180 --> 01:49:27.180
No.

01:49:27.180 --> 01:49:33.180
No. Then we had Whiterob say secret tale from 2DX7 style because of the tattle tales thing.

01:49:33.180 --> 01:49:36.180
And the fact that each curtain behind Let's Make a Deal had a secret behind it.

01:49:36.180 --> 01:49:38.180
That's good reasoning, but no.

01:49:38.180 --> 01:49:39.180
That's a very good reasoning.

01:49:39.180 --> 01:49:41.180
I'm really shocked with that reasoning. That was great.

01:49:41.180 --> 01:49:46.180
Kabut says my guess on the clues is Paranoia Survivor Max because the sound clip played was really fast like the song

01:49:46.180 --> 01:49:51.180
and the quote talking about tattling, so that might mean paranoia and the curtain thing surprising.

01:49:51.180 --> 01:49:52.180
No.

01:49:52.180 --> 01:49:53.180
No.

01:49:53.180 --> 01:49:54.660
All right.

01:49:54.660 --> 01:49:58.180
And then we had MJS I24 say, it's a song called Last Romance.

01:49:58.180 --> 01:50:03.180
I typed in, let's make a deal and awesome into Google and that was the first bit.

01:50:03.180 --> 01:50:04.180
No.

01:50:04.180 --> 01:50:06.220
All right.

01:50:06.220 --> 01:50:07.220
I like that one.

01:50:07.220 --> 01:50:08.460
I'm going to suggest that, man.

01:50:08.460 --> 01:50:09.580
And then.

01:50:09.580 --> 01:50:10.580
Just for the reasoning.

01:50:10.580 --> 01:50:12.380
Somebody submitted the correct answer.

01:50:12.380 --> 01:50:13.380
Oh my goodness.

01:50:13.380 --> 01:50:18.300
about to call them right here on the air and they're going to announce what the

01:50:18.300 --> 01:50:20.420
song is to everybody so I'm hoping they're picking up because they actually

01:50:20.420 --> 01:50:23.180
have Skype on their system. I seriously can't believe that. So we're gonna see if

01:50:23.180 --> 01:50:27.020
we can get it here. I'm hoping he can pick up otherwise he's gonna do the

01:50:27.020 --> 01:50:35.020
chatroom thing. Let's see. I'm hoping it's going through. We're trying to get

01:50:35.020 --> 01:50:48.140
through there is ringing hello is this jazz hello jazz hey how are you pretty

01:50:48.140 --> 01:50:52.900
good good hey guess what you got the song what's up all right all right but I

01:50:52.900 --> 01:50:57.780
have to say two other people got it as well but you know you got it first you

01:50:57.780 --> 01:51:03.180
who are the runner-ups all right quick tell us what it is it's called tittle

01:51:03.180 --> 01:51:08.540
by Zonk. That is correct. The new song is Tittle Tattle by Zonk. And what was the

01:51:08.540 --> 01:51:14.700
reasoning behind that? Because I looked it up on Google and I found that the

01:51:14.700 --> 01:51:19.220
losing things in Let's Make a Deal are called Zonks. Yep, that's correct. I looked up

01:51:19.220 --> 01:51:23.000
their website and I found that it has the song called Tittle Tattle. So I just

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:27.140
put two, two, and together. Oh, so he just gets the song. I want to point out though

01:51:27.140 --> 01:51:32.300
that Apollo Chan was one of the other people that got it right. They said the

01:51:32.300 --> 01:51:35.600
sound file was tittle they correct yes that that little sound file that we

01:51:35.600 --> 01:51:40.280
played was tittle on that website and then the tattle bit and a zonk so Apollo

01:51:40.280 --> 01:51:43.760
Chan had that right as well and then nigma also had it right saying one

01:51:43.760 --> 01:51:47.880
tattle then to the tapping in the song in the name of the band so Apollo Chan

01:51:47.880 --> 01:51:51.620
had the 100% correct reasoning why what we were doing but jazz you still got it

01:51:51.620 --> 01:51:58.040
first congratulations all right how do you feel how do you feel I want to go

01:51:58.040 --> 01:52:01.040
Good job. You're the smart kid tonight.

01:52:01.040 --> 01:52:02.040
Yay.

01:52:02.040 --> 01:52:05.040
Hey, did you beat Doom 3?

01:52:05.040 --> 01:52:09.040
No, I'm waiting for someone to come over because I'm scared.

01:52:09.040 --> 01:52:14.040
Alright, thanks for calling us, Jazz, and congratulations to you.

01:52:14.040 --> 01:52:15.040
Thank you.

01:52:15.040 --> 01:52:17.040
Alright, have a good one.

01:52:17.040 --> 01:52:20.040
See, that was cool. I like the Skype thing. That was great.

01:52:20.040 --> 01:52:23.040
Alright, here it is, guys. We're going to play the song for you.

01:52:23.040 --> 01:52:25.040
Again, as announced by The Clues.

01:52:25.040 --> 01:52:30.600
This was Tiddle, was the name of the sound file, and of course there was the

01:52:30.600 --> 01:52:33.760
Mama don't like tattle-dads. The Tails.

01:52:33.760 --> 01:52:37.680
And then the Let's Make a Deal was a Zonk when you lost.

01:52:37.680 --> 01:52:41.280
So the song is Tiddle Tattle and the

01:52:41.280 --> 01:52:45.720
artist is Zonk. And we're gonna play it for you right now. And I gotta say,

01:52:45.720 --> 01:52:50.000
this is a very interesting song. It is not a typical kind of

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:53.280
thing I would think about when I think about DDR.

01:52:53.280 --> 01:52:56.360
So

01:52:56.360 --> 01:53:00.200
here it is. I'm queuing it up here. The artist is

01:53:00.200 --> 01:53:03.340
Zonk and the song is called Tittle Tattle.

01:53:03.340 --> 01:53:05.340
Enjoy!

01:53:33.340 --> 01:53:36.340
Not even a burden

01:53:56.340 --> 01:53:59.340
Shea, shoon and humdrum

01:53:59.340 --> 01:54:02.340
Tome, poem, dream

01:54:02.340 --> 01:54:07.260
Alpha perfection, so very hard to reach

01:54:07.260 --> 01:54:12.860
Harmony machine, tormenting the sensory

01:54:12.860 --> 01:54:18.020
Deliciously evolved, and yet nobody knows

01:54:18.020 --> 01:54:22.980
Analyzing, hallucinations, window licking the imagination

01:54:22.980 --> 01:54:25.980
Singing, singing, shadows missing

01:54:25.980 --> 01:54:28.980
Can't you sing in a symphony?

01:54:38.980 --> 01:54:40.980
Diddle daddle, chicka chicka

01:54:40.980 --> 01:54:43.980
Shoots in the breeze

01:54:43.980 --> 01:54:46.980
Puddles, clucks, cadence, sludders

01:54:46.980 --> 01:54:49.980
There's a synchronous symphony

01:54:49.980 --> 01:54:51.980
Diddle daddle, chicka chicka

01:54:51.980 --> 01:54:54.220
Shoots in the breeze

01:54:54.220 --> 01:54:57.180
Pettis, claque, cadence, lettuce

01:54:57.180 --> 01:54:59.660
This is a synchronous symphony

01:54:59.660 --> 01:55:25.660
Play from the familiar, conjure a search of jive

01:55:25.660 --> 01:55:30.660
Fidget in her mind, enjoy cats with no regrets

01:55:30.660 --> 01:55:35.660
Analyzing, hallucinations, window licking the imagination

01:55:35.660 --> 01:55:41.660
Big as vision, shadows dancing, dancing synchronous symphonies

01:55:41.660 --> 01:56:00.820
Tickle, saddle, cheeky, shat, shoots in debris Pat-a-clack, cadence, flutter, tears of synchronous

01:56:00.820 --> 01:56:07.220
symphony Tickle, saddle, chain, shat, shoots in debris

01:56:07.220 --> 01:56:09.240
Pat-a-clack, Cadence.

01:56:09.240 --> 01:56:13.140
Ladder, is a synchronous symphony.

01:56:13.140 --> 01:56:15.420
Diddle, daddle, chate and chat.

01:56:15.420 --> 01:56:18.240
Shoot and de everyday.

01:56:18.240 --> 01:56:20.040
Diddle, clack, cadence.

01:56:20.040 --> 01:56:23.500
Ladder, is a synchronous symphony.

01:56:23.500 --> 01:56:25.940
Diddle, daddle, chate and chat.

01:56:25.940 --> 01:56:27.820
Shoot and de everyday.

01:56:27.820 --> 01:56:30.800
Pat-a-clack, cadence.

01:56:30.800 --> 01:56:33.800
It's a synchronous symphony

01:57:00.800 --> 01:57:04.320
earlier, that was Zonk with Tittle Tattle. What did you guys think of that? It was the

01:57:04.320 --> 01:57:06.440
first listen for all of us here. What did you think?

01:57:06.440 --> 01:57:10.640
I liked that song. That song was cool. It was swingy.

01:57:10.640 --> 01:57:14.360
That was unlike a lot of other DDR songs. I mean, you could say it's kind of like an

01:57:14.360 --> 01:57:18.240
athletic song, but that's really stretching it. Really, really stretching it. I think

01:57:18.240 --> 01:57:21.400
it's very original. I think it's a great ad for DDR.

01:57:21.400 --> 01:57:24.720
Lanky style. Interesting. Yeah.

01:57:24.720 --> 01:57:29.240
Just interesting? It just, the music production on it is just

01:57:29.240 --> 01:57:33.100
strange, which is good because that's kind of the way, you know, Konami originals are

01:57:33.100 --> 01:57:38.720
strange. Now, um, I'm sorry, I just want to add, this is not

01:57:38.720 --> 01:57:42.900
a long version. We just happen to only have the full cut of the song, not the

01:57:42.900 --> 01:57:46.740
edit. So long versions are not coming back to Ultramix 2, as far as we know.

01:57:46.740 --> 01:57:51.960
Um, let me put that in, in better words, they're not coming back at all.

01:57:51.960 --> 01:57:56.240
Alright. So if you're pining for a long version, go play Fifth Mix.

01:57:56.240 --> 01:57:58.540
Alright. Well, thank you for clearing that up.

01:57:58.540 --> 01:58:02.220
I didn't know if you could say one way or the other, but okay, there you have it.

01:58:02.220 --> 01:58:06.260
Also, people that listen to that song, if you think it's kind of odd sounding and

01:58:06.260 --> 01:58:09.460
doesn't really fit DDR or something, Ultramix 2

01:58:09.460 --> 01:58:13.660
has a completely new direction than what you'd see on the PS2 releases.

01:58:13.660 --> 01:58:20.100
So, yeah, it's awesome. The genres we have are really great.

01:58:20.100 --> 01:58:24.580
Alright, that was cool. I'm glad you decided to share that one with us.

01:58:24.580 --> 01:58:27.300
Yeah, I was mulling over in my head which one to do, and I was like,

01:58:27.300 --> 01:58:29.300
That's a pretty good song.

01:58:57.300 --> 01:59:02.340
staying in. I don't know. That's what somebody asked me. He doesn't even know what the hell

01:59:02.340 --> 01:59:10.340
that it means. Yeah, I have no clue what you're talking about, but for the most part, the

01:59:10.340 --> 01:59:15.180
long version of the song is, if you could just like cut it in half, you keep all the

01:59:15.180 --> 01:59:21.380
music styles in it and all the singing, that's what you've got. Think of it as a long version

01:59:21.380 --> 01:59:24.820
or doubled over from what you just heard. Alright, I'm going to be brave and open up

01:59:24.820 --> 01:59:30.820
the skype line for feedback on that song or UltraMix 2 in general. So you can give us

01:59:30.820 --> 01:59:34.320
a call on the skype line if you don't know how to call us on the skype line. Head on

01:59:34.320 --> 01:59:38.660
over to www.orangeloungeradio.org and click on interact with us. It's a brand new section

01:59:38.660 --> 01:59:45.260
on our website. Thank you Jason. And it talks about how you could call the show if you want.

01:59:45.260 --> 01:59:50.100
So please do give us a call on the skype line if you have a comment on the song or you know

01:59:50.100 --> 01:59:55.180
UltraMix 2 in general. And after we field a couple calls, we're going to do Ask Orange

01:59:55.180 --> 01:59:59.260
Lounge in a little bit. Because we haven't done that for a few weeks now, so we definitely

01:59:59.260 --> 02:00:04.420
want to let you guys ask a question of any host here, or certainly Siegert. However,

02:00:04.420 --> 02:00:08.680
there will be a rule to tonight's Ask Orange Lounge. You may not ask Siegert anything about

02:00:08.680 --> 02:00:14.340
UltraMix 2 or DDR Extreme. You can ask him about his sex life, you can ask him about

02:00:14.340 --> 02:00:19.140
his living, but you cannot ask him anything about UltraMix 2 or Extreme. That's the rule

02:00:19.140 --> 02:00:24.140
If you do, don't expect any more hints on the DDR preboards.

02:00:24.140 --> 02:00:26.140
Exactly. No more hints. That's it.

02:00:26.140 --> 02:00:29.140
You might ask, hey, is it a good game? And I'll probably say yes.

02:00:29.140 --> 02:00:33.140
But I'm not going to tell you, you know, oh, this song isn't it and this song isn't.

02:00:33.140 --> 02:00:36.140
You know, you can probably use controllers with it and stuff like that.

02:00:36.140 --> 02:00:39.140
But, yeah, that's all you're getting.

02:00:41.140 --> 02:00:44.140
Then their DDR will feature arrows!

02:00:46.140 --> 02:00:48.140
We're not getting any calls so I guess nobody has any feedback on that.

02:00:48.140 --> 02:00:54.240
back on that. The Skype thing is still new also as well. A couple weeks back I

02:00:54.240 --> 02:00:59.700
was on here and I said that you know the new song or one of the new songs has up

02:00:59.700 --> 02:01:06.340
arrows. Do you know how like bad that sent the DDR Extreme US forum into like

02:01:06.340 --> 02:01:10.460
crazy shambles? They thought like oh it has up arrows let's look for songs that

02:01:10.460 --> 02:01:16.300
have up arrows and it was the funniest thing ever. I should say those ones with

02:01:16.300 --> 02:01:21.040
left arrows this time. See what happens. Okay, nobody's calling on the Skype line, so I guess

02:01:21.040 --> 02:01:25.000
we'll close it and we'll open it back up later during Ask Orange Lounge. However, again,

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:30.620
you can ask him about Ultra- you cannot ask him about Ultra Mix 2 or Extreme. If you do,

02:01:30.620 --> 02:01:33.920
one of us will answer the question, who knows nothing about the game? And the reason for

02:01:33.920 --> 02:01:40.920
that is the three-letter word called the NDA, which means he can't talk about things that

02:01:40.920 --> 02:01:46.760
have not been announced yet. Alright. ABC. That's why. That's why you can ask him personal

02:01:46.760 --> 02:01:50.260
questions, but you can't ask him about these stuff. But you know what? Why's it gotta be

02:01:50.260 --> 02:01:53.200
all about Seagrid all the time? Of course, granted, I know you're gonna be really busy

02:01:53.200 --> 02:01:56.120
the next few months, so you're not gonna be able to come back to the show for a while.

02:01:56.120 --> 02:01:59.680
I really appreciate you hanging out here, though. Oh, no problem. Not only this week,

02:01:59.680 --> 02:02:03.120
but a couple weeks ago. Maybe you'll come back after the games are released and give

02:02:03.120 --> 02:02:07.640
us some more information. Yeah, I could probably do that. Definitely. So, thank you, certainly.

02:02:07.640 --> 02:02:09.640
I know you're going to be busy in the next couple of months, so...

02:02:09.640 --> 02:02:12.640
Alright, let's do a break.

02:02:12.640 --> 02:02:16.640
And then we'll come back and we'll do some Ask Orange Lounge since Skype people didn't want to come.

02:02:16.640 --> 02:02:17.640
I see how it is.

02:02:17.640 --> 02:02:18.640
What do you guys want to hear this break?

02:02:18.640 --> 02:02:19.640
Secret, what do you want to hear this break?

02:02:19.640 --> 02:02:20.640
I'll let you pick a song.

02:02:20.640 --> 02:02:21.640
Um...

02:02:21.640 --> 02:02:23.640
If I have it available, I hope.

02:02:23.640 --> 02:02:24.640
Uh, let's...

02:02:24.640 --> 02:02:25.640
Do you have any athletic songs?

02:02:25.640 --> 02:02:27.640
Do I have any athletic songs?

02:02:27.640 --> 02:02:28.640
Of course I do.

02:02:28.640 --> 02:02:30.640
How about War Game from 8 style?

02:02:30.640 --> 02:02:31.640
Yeah, Hit and Slap.

02:02:31.640 --> 02:02:32.640
I want to hear Hit and Slap.

02:02:32.640 --> 02:02:33.640
I don't know if I have Hit and Slap available.

02:02:33.640 --> 02:02:34.640
Uh, Fire Dub?

02:02:34.640 --> 02:02:35.640
I'll try and find it.

02:02:35.640 --> 02:02:39.760
Firedub, I think I have Firedub. I will try and find Firedub

02:02:39.760 --> 02:02:43.960
for you. Alright, Disco Dog, because Jamie wants to hear it, which is also athletics.

02:02:43.960 --> 02:02:47.440
So we'll just make it an athletics break. Yay! Alright, we'll be back

02:02:47.440 --> 02:02:51.480
with some Ask Orange Lounge. Start submitting your questions now.

02:02:51.480 --> 02:02:58.480
we'll be back

02:04:51.480 --> 02:05:01.960
Okay, the only way I have this song is with the new music thing over it, because we added

02:05:01.960 --> 02:05:05.240
it back when it was still new, but just ignore the new music part.

02:05:05.240 --> 02:05:06.240
It's new!

02:05:06.240 --> 02:05:08.320
On Orange Lounge Radio.

02:05:08.320 --> 02:05:12.120
This song's in the newest downloadable pack for DDR UltraMix.

02:05:12.120 --> 02:05:14.120
This is Athletics with Firedub.

02:05:42.120 --> 02:06:10.120
I don't want no ice cream, no love, girl, can't You don't want no ice cream, no love, girl, can't

02:07:10.120 --> 02:07:20.120
Not doing it, not doing it

02:07:50.120 --> 02:07:56.120
Mr. Random person on the street, who by the way is not an actor, what do you think of the Orange Lounge Big Money Music and More show?

02:07:56.120 --> 02:08:10.120
The music is like being transported to this dancing spaceship place. It's unearthly. It's like being in a club except you don't have to ask someone to dance.

02:08:10.120 --> 02:08:16.160
We are back with Orange Lounge Radio, and what we're going to do now is we're going

02:08:16.160 --> 02:08:20.440
to get into the Ask Orange Lounge section of the show.

02:08:20.440 --> 02:08:24.940
It's been like three weeks since we've done this, so I know you guys probably have a lot

02:08:24.940 --> 02:08:28.880
of good questions to ask tonight, and we will open up Skype even for the questions, or feedback

02:08:28.880 --> 02:08:34.220
in general on the show, because we're winding down if anybody wants to use Skype.

02:08:34.220 --> 02:08:35.220
I think some people do.

02:08:35.220 --> 02:08:38.020
We got added by a couple people during the break there, so I think some people are learning

02:08:38.020 --> 02:08:45.020
how to use it. So that's cool. Okay, here we go guys with Ask Orange Lounge. Let's ask

02:08:53.400 --> 02:09:00.240
Orange Lounge some stupid question. What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

02:09:00.240 --> 02:09:04.600
But I think this week will be interesting. Do you want to know why? Because whenever

02:09:04.600 --> 02:09:10.600
Where secret comes, the rest of us, don't get any attention.

02:09:10.600 --> 02:09:13.720
Alright.

02:09:13.720 --> 02:09:18.680
I remember when you were on this show a year ago, and you were just, and nobody cared.

02:09:18.680 --> 02:09:20.760
It's because I didn't have insider information.

02:09:20.760 --> 02:09:22.400
Yeah, you didn't work for Konami.

02:09:22.400 --> 02:09:26.640
You weren't, uh, I remember you were here for our Max 2 premiere, shall we?

02:09:26.640 --> 02:09:27.640
Yeah, I was there for that.

02:09:27.640 --> 02:09:29.760
We were first playing Max 2, and who would have thought that you would have gotten to

02:09:29.760 --> 02:09:30.960
see the next one before everyone else?

02:09:30.960 --> 02:09:33.520
It's probably because I like Forever Sunshine so much.

02:09:33.520 --> 02:09:36.520
Alright, let's get to the questions, shall we?

02:09:36.520 --> 02:09:39.520
Uh, starting off with a question from...

02:09:39.520 --> 02:09:42.520
Uh, let's see, oop, we got that one. Uh, I know John Fields had a question.

02:09:42.520 --> 02:09:45.520
Oh yeah, I'm sure you're going to want to answer this, Seagurd.

02:09:45.520 --> 02:09:46.520
Question to you.

02:09:46.520 --> 02:09:49.520
How much money do you make at Konami per year?

02:09:50.520 --> 02:09:53.520
Yeah, I make a dollar per year.

02:09:56.520 --> 02:09:57.520
I know, yeah, we...

02:09:57.520 --> 02:10:00.520
Well, you know, maybe somebody's interested in getting into the profession,

02:10:00.520 --> 02:10:04.020
but I believe there are contracts that you sign that say you can't disclose what you make, right?

02:10:04.020 --> 02:10:06.520
Yeah, well, I think that's the same way with every job, pretty much.

02:10:06.520 --> 02:10:09.520
Unless you're, like, trying to get somebody hired on, then you offer them, you know,

02:10:09.520 --> 02:10:12.520
this is how much you'll make in a year or this is how much you'll make in an hour or whatever,

02:10:12.520 --> 02:10:17.520
but it's, like, either an unwritten rule or a written rule that you don't discuss, you know,

02:10:17.520 --> 02:10:21.520
your earnings at work or of your work.

02:10:21.520 --> 02:10:24.520
So just keep imagining he's filthy, stinky, rich.

02:10:24.520 --> 02:10:28.520
Yeah, I'm rich with pornos.

02:10:28.520 --> 02:10:32.840
MJSI24, I have no idea a quick way to pronounce that name.

02:10:32.840 --> 02:10:38.120
How long has Seager been working at Konami, and how did he get his job?

02:10:38.120 --> 02:10:39.840
Hoping this does not violate the NDA.

02:10:39.840 --> 02:10:43.000
So whatever you can say that doesn't violate the NDA, although I believe you addressed

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:44.800
this two weeks ago when you were here.

02:10:44.800 --> 02:10:45.800
Did I?

02:10:45.800 --> 02:10:46.800
What did I say?

02:10:46.800 --> 02:10:48.960
I think you said it's a job they were hiring.

02:10:48.960 --> 02:10:51.200
Yeah, it's a job they were hiring.

02:10:51.200 --> 02:10:55.840
They advertise on their website, I've been working there for a little while, I won't

02:10:55.840 --> 02:11:02.560
exactly how long, because there's no point to, but yeah. Just look on their website.

02:11:02.560 --> 02:11:05.560
They always have, you know, well they don't always have openings, but if they have an

02:11:05.560 --> 02:11:08.440
opening they will post it, and just check it out there.

02:11:08.440 --> 02:11:12.060
Alright, I open up the Skype line if anybody wants to contact us there. Remember, please

02:11:12.060 --> 02:11:15.580
do not call when the Do Not Disturb light is on, because that means we're either on

02:11:15.580 --> 02:11:18.760
another call or we're doing something else during the show and we're not taking your

02:11:18.760 --> 02:11:24.760
call, but we do have a couple questions over here.

02:11:24.760 --> 02:11:28.600
Karma Titan says, I heard DDR Extreme was the last mix from the DDR series from

02:11:28.600 --> 02:11:32.920
DDRmaniacs.net. True or false? Actually, I'll answer this one. I'll go ahead and

02:11:32.920 --> 02:11:37.800
answer this question. It is absolutely, don't believe anything that you read on

02:11:37.800 --> 02:11:44.360
that site, right? I'm just kidding. No, I, he doesn't, do you want to try this one

02:11:44.360 --> 02:11:49.560
Yeah, I can do this one. Um, don't listen to internet rumors or anything like that.

02:11:49.560 --> 02:11:54.560
If there is going to be another one, just check Konami's site.

02:11:54.560 --> 02:11:59.080
Or Orange Lounge Radio. This is from a site that just announced,

02:11:59.080 --> 02:12:03.520
Hey, DDR Festival Mix is coming out. Um, wait a second.

02:12:03.520 --> 02:12:04.800
No, no, no. That would be in the DDR2.

02:12:04.800 --> 02:12:09.320
Konami's USA, not Japan's USA. Oh yeah, you know, because they're making

02:12:09.320 --> 02:12:11.680
money now, so. Oh, stop, stop.

02:12:11.680 --> 02:12:13.440
Alright, anyway. What are they, Nickelodeon?

02:12:13.440 --> 02:12:16.960
Let me answer the call we just took. Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

02:12:16.960 --> 02:12:21.800
Hi, um... Excuse me.

02:12:21.800 --> 02:12:24.320
Yeah, um...

02:12:24.320 --> 02:12:25.660
Are you laughing at me?

02:12:25.660 --> 02:12:29.900
Yes, I am. No, I'm just teasing. What's up?

02:12:29.900 --> 02:12:31.700
Yeah, why'd you ban me?

02:12:31.700 --> 02:12:33.800
Oh, oh...

02:12:33.800 --> 02:12:40.180
It's people that can't get over themselves. Oh...

02:12:40.180 --> 02:12:43.420

02:13:16.320 --> 02:13:17.320
Get over it!

02:13:17.320 --> 02:13:18.320
Go bug somebody else.

02:13:18.320 --> 02:13:26.480
Aren't you like a moderator on some unknown crappy Bimani site somewhere?

02:13:26.480 --> 02:13:30.520
Actually not quite an unknown site, but yeah.

02:13:30.520 --> 02:13:35.420
Okay, if you have to have something to validate yourself, why not try the internet like everybody

02:13:35.420 --> 02:13:36.420
else does?

02:13:36.420 --> 02:13:39.520
Alright, that's 60 seconds spent too much on that topic.

02:13:39.520 --> 02:13:47.400

Alright.

02:14:45.160 --> 02:14:46.160
I got it.

02:14:46.160 --> 02:14:47.160
It's alright.

02:14:47.160 --> 02:14:48.160
Who is this?

02:14:48.160 --> 02:14:49.160
Turn down the Winamp!

02:14:49.160 --> 02:14:50.160
Turn it down!

02:14:50.160 --> 02:14:51.160
I did not get the phone to be our own show.

02:14:51.160 --> 02:14:52.160
Turn off the Winamp and call us back.

02:14:52.160 --> 02:14:53.160
Damn.

02:14:53.160 --> 02:14:54.160
No.

02:14:54.160 --> 02:14:55.160
Alright.

02:14:55.160 --> 02:15:01.760
Nigma has a question.

02:15:01.760 --> 02:15:13.680
I guess this is for Sigurd.

02:15:13.680 --> 02:15:17.680
Does Konami read their message boards?

02:15:17.680 --> 02:15:22.680
No, of course not. Because, you know, they're not like on DDR Freak or anything.

02:15:22.680 --> 02:15:25.680
No.

02:15:25.680 --> 02:15:28.680
Really quick. Really quickly.

02:15:28.680 --> 02:15:29.680
It turns off everything.

02:15:29.680 --> 02:15:32.680
Hold on, caller. We'll get to you in a minute.

02:15:32.680 --> 02:15:39.680
Yeah, they read their message boards, obviously, because, like Loki stated, duh.

02:15:39.680 --> 02:15:40.680
Pretty much.

02:15:40.680 --> 02:15:47.840
All right caller hi welcome to orange ons radio. What's up? Yeah on DDR maniacs. I also heard that

02:15:49.060 --> 02:15:52.080
the artist Naoki from the DDR series

02:15:53.320 --> 02:15:57.020
Was it I heard that everyone all the artists like

02:15:57.760 --> 02:16:02.700
Reven g or Omega and all that are Naoki, so I do have the same

02:16:02.700 --> 02:16:12.700
Well, if you'll pick up a copy of DDR Max and read that instruction manual, you can see all of Naoki's handles, and there's about 20 of them, at least.

02:16:12.700 --> 02:16:15.700
Okay?

02:16:15.700 --> 02:16:22.700
Okay. I guess that was a nod of acceptance, I don't know. Thanks for the call!

02:16:22.700 --> 02:16:24.700
Alright.

02:16:24.700 --> 02:16:26.700
He was listening to his radio.

02:16:26.700 --> 02:16:31.700
First rule in radio, never listen to your radio on the phone call.

02:16:31.700 --> 02:16:34.700
Well, he said it wouldn't work otherwise. I don't know.

02:16:34.700 --> 02:16:35.700
That's stupid.

02:16:35.700 --> 02:16:37.700
I don't know. We'll see.

02:16:37.700 --> 02:16:41.700
He probably had one of those non-duplex sound cards.

02:16:41.700 --> 02:16:43.700
Oh, you know what? That might do it.

02:16:43.700 --> 02:16:44.700
I'm an idiot.

02:16:44.700 --> 02:16:46.700
That might do it. I don't know.

02:16:46.700 --> 02:16:49.700
I don't have one and I can still talk about it twice.

02:16:49.700 --> 02:16:50.700
Alright.

02:16:50.700 --> 02:16:51.700
No, I'm talking about Moto.

02:16:51.700 --> 02:16:53.700
Nigma had another question I want to get to.

02:16:53.700 --> 02:16:57.700
Are any of you or people you know going to the tournament in New York in October?

02:16:57.700 --> 02:17:02.140
Well, seeing as we're on the West Coast, not really likely any of us are flying up there.

02:17:02.140 --> 02:17:04.940
Buy us a plane ticket, we will gladly make a cameo.

02:17:04.940 --> 02:17:08.060
Nobody here has any travel plans to New York in October?

02:17:08.060 --> 02:17:11.260
I'm going at the end of September, but there's no tournament. I might go to eight on the break, though.

02:17:11.260 --> 02:17:14.820
Yeah, I might be going to New York in September to blow up another building.

02:17:14.820 --> 02:17:18.020
Stop it! Not funny. Stop it.

02:17:18.020 --> 02:17:21.500
It's for my birthday!

02:17:21.500 --> 02:17:24.700
Come on! It worked one year.

02:17:24.700 --> 02:17:31.700
horrible. Alright.

02:17:32.140 --> 02:17:36.580
Very, very not nice. Alright, let's see, uh,

02:17:36.580 --> 02:17:40.380
Skyline's open for a few more seconds. Otherwise, um,

02:17:40.380 --> 02:17:44.340
does anybody else have a question for somebody else in the room? That's what we

02:17:44.340 --> 02:17:46.460
usually do when we have no other questions. We got a couple

02:17:46.460 --> 02:17:49.740
minutes left to show here. Does anybody in the room have a question for somebody

02:17:49.740 --> 02:17:50.580
else in the room?

02:17:50.580 --> 02:17:56.580
I'm really sad we didn't get to do that last clue, Sigurd. We actually have one more clue we were going to do.

02:17:56.580 --> 02:18:02.580
Do you want to hear- we want to still do it? Okay. Let's do that last clue we were going to do, alright?

02:18:02.580 --> 02:18:07.580
This was the last clue you were going to hear if you didn't get it, even though Irene's not paying attention and the clue involves her.

02:18:07.580 --> 02:18:14.580
But, uh, Sigurd- oh, Sigurd was actually going to, uh, let me have the fourth clue because he didn't want to say this.

02:18:14.580 --> 02:18:19.580
But this was the fourth clue. Irene, I just want to say that you have really nice tits.

02:18:19.580 --> 02:18:26.580
It's too bad they're kind of little. In fact, you might call them tittles.

02:18:26.580 --> 02:18:32.580
That was the fourth clue. That was so awful.

02:18:32.580 --> 02:18:36.580
That was the clue that Sigurd and I came up with earlier.

02:18:36.580 --> 02:18:38.580
I got one. Hold on, I got a fifth clue.

02:18:38.580 --> 02:18:45.580
Rob, you have a nice dick. Too bad it's a little little. You might call it dickle.

02:18:45.580 --> 02:18:50.800
oh god

02:18:50.800 --> 02:18:54.280
no I'm just kidding rice princess has huge boobs

02:18:54.280 --> 02:18:58.960
don't uh don't believe the rumors alright the rumors what

02:18:58.960 --> 02:19:02.680
I haven't started any rumors

02:19:02.680 --> 02:19:05.800
uh kabut

02:19:05.800 --> 02:19:09.400
that's the name is kabut instead of kaboom it's kabut

02:19:09.400 --> 02:19:15.800
I've said the name like twice already in the show because he sent other questions.

02:19:15.800 --> 02:19:21.120
Kabut wants to know, how big is your E penis?

02:19:21.120 --> 02:19:22.120
Anybody want to answer?

02:19:22.120 --> 02:19:23.920
I think Jamie should answer this one.

02:19:23.920 --> 02:19:29.760
Dark Sakura, how big is your E penis?

02:19:29.760 --> 02:19:32.480
Very large.

02:19:32.480 --> 02:19:36.160
How big is your E penis, Dark Sakura?

02:19:36.160 --> 02:19:41.680
holding up her hands holding up her hands about about four feet she's hung

02:19:41.680 --> 02:19:52.480

02:20:06.480 --> 02:20:16.800
have any internet sex tapes no last question karma Titan says how come last

02:20:16.800 --> 02:20:19.720
week my first time on orange launch radio how come the place looks

02:20:19.720 --> 02:20:24.480
different didn't we have the big spiderweb on the camera last week that

02:20:24.480 --> 02:20:27.720
might be one thing yeah I'm not sure I think it's just because we have

02:20:27.720 --> 02:20:31.560
different people here the lighting might be a little different but we I turn the

02:20:31.560 --> 02:20:33.560
He turned the camera slightly to the left.

02:20:33.560 --> 02:20:36.560
Oh, okay. I guess that's it. He turned the camera slightly to the left.

02:20:36.560 --> 02:20:39.560
And, uh, there's more crap on the table.

02:20:39.560 --> 02:20:42.560
Oh, John Fields has a good question. I'll take this as the last question.

02:20:42.560 --> 02:20:44.560
Does Orange House Radio have any-

02:20:44.560 --> 02:20:48.560
Oh, and there's Peach Girl posters on the wall, thanks to Nellie.

02:20:48.560 --> 02:20:50.560
Oh, maybe that's what it is.

02:20:50.560 --> 02:20:52.560
She hung up the porno posters on the wall.

02:20:52.560 --> 02:20:55.560
Maybe that's what it is. I thought something's different.

02:20:55.560 --> 02:21:01.860
Okay, last question from John Fields. Do we have any plans to put old episodes in MP3

02:21:01.860 --> 02:21:08.360
on CD for sale at some point in the future? And actually, well at the classic gaming show

02:21:08.360 --> 02:21:13.000
there was another radio station that has to do with retro gaming that was selling copies

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:18.800
of their show on DVD. The only gray area with our show is that we actually play not only

02:21:18.800 --> 02:21:23.560
Bahmani music, but thanks to our cage match, which granted wasn't in the first 20 episodes,

02:21:23.560 --> 02:21:28.480
has been there for the majority of our show. The Cage Match has other real music, so we

02:21:28.480 --> 02:21:33.520
can't really turn around and sell that music. We could go through and edit it all out, but

02:21:33.520 --> 02:21:37.480
that would be kind of a pain in the ass. I don't know. So, we'll just kind of have to

02:21:37.480 --> 02:21:44.000
see what happens. I don't think we can feasibly do it, but I don't know. As far as distribution

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:48.160
plans for getting the old episodes out there, we'll have to just see in the future. We'll

02:21:48.160 --> 02:21:53.240
see. Alright. Also, Angel is the official historian of Orange Laundry Radio and has

02:21:53.240 --> 02:21:57.760
them all on MP3, except I would like to point out that this week I forgot to start archiving

02:21:57.760 --> 02:22:03.520
until about 45 minutes into the show, so on Thursday during the new Orange Lawns Radio

02:22:03.520 --> 02:22:07.800
Rewind at 6, you're only going to get part of the show, and that's my bad. Sorry.

02:22:07.800 --> 02:22:17.800
Bad Rob, bad. No, no one is going to ask me for copies. No, they're mine. I'm not funny.

02:22:17.800 --> 02:22:24.280
All right, all right, um, I guess now it's time to kind of wrap up the show you guys that's it

02:22:24.280 --> 02:22:30.640
Thank you for asking the questions on a score lounge. It is 930 time to wrap up the show go around and get everybody's

02:22:31.240 --> 02:22:34.600
Final thought we're going to start off tonight's final thought from

02:22:36.160 --> 02:22:40.320
Hand the microphone to somebody Jimmy. Oh who has the second mic? Oh

02:22:40.320 --> 02:22:42.320
One of them is being held by Ethan.

02:22:49.320 --> 02:22:51.320
Say something, somebody.

02:22:52.320 --> 02:22:53.320
Final thought.

02:22:54.320 --> 02:22:55.320
Final thought.

02:22:56.320 --> 02:22:57.320
I have none.

02:22:57.320 --> 02:23:08.440
Well, lanky style your final thought all right lanky style final thought my neck

02:23:08.440 --> 02:23:20.200
my back yeah so pass off to somebody else haven't give us their final thought

02:23:20.200 --> 02:23:32.100

02:23:32.100 --> 02:23:43.180
right well angel crash and everyone knows what I'm talking about not that

02:23:43.180 --> 02:23:51.180
it's a big deal because I think we can all go home now. Yeah, that's it.

02:23:51.180 --> 02:24:01.180
Seegerd, your final thought? I hope my iPod is done charging.

02:24:01.180 --> 02:24:05.180
And, Loki, your final thought?

02:24:05.180 --> 02:24:11.180
Where's the microphone? Oh, that's my final thought. Where's the microphone?

02:24:11.180 --> 02:24:17.360
And my final thought is tune in to Pump Up The Volume on Tuesday and Diversion on Monday

02:24:17.360 --> 02:24:22.320
and Who Knows What on Wednesday and the Orange Mountains Radio Rewind on Thursday and all

02:24:22.320 --> 02:24:23.660
the good stuff in between.

02:24:23.660 --> 02:24:27.900
The fun just doesn't end here on Orange Mountains Radio Live, that's for sure.

02:24:27.900 --> 02:24:29.540
Jamie your final thought?

02:24:29.540 --> 02:24:34.900
Tuesday is Pump Up The Volume with the pre-show starting at 7 o'clock, although it didn't

02:24:34.900 --> 02:24:36.180
start a little bit earlier.

02:24:36.180 --> 02:24:43.780
On that day I will be playing the CD of 8-Bit Warriors and also the U.S. Silent Hill 4 soundtrack

02:24:43.780 --> 02:24:45.580
in its entirety.

02:24:45.580 --> 02:24:48.580
So make sure you're listening.

02:24:48.580 --> 02:24:49.580
It will be Q.

02:24:49.580 --> 02:24:50.740
All right.

02:24:50.740 --> 02:24:54.860
The final word of the show, one word to sum up the whole show.

02:24:54.860 --> 02:24:59.460
I guess Rice Princess, we're going to give out Rice Princess because she didn't talk

02:24:59.460 --> 02:25:00.620
a whole lot this show.

02:25:00.620 --> 02:25:05.380
Rice Princess, the final word of the show is meow.

02:25:05.380 --> 02:25:08.700

And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

02:25:29.900 --> 02:25:46.860
Folks, I'd like to sing a song about the American dream, about me, about you, about the way

02:25:46.860 --> 02:25:52.560
our American hearts beat way down in the bottom of our chests, about that special feeling

02:25:52.560 --> 02:25:57.300
we get in the cockles of our hearts, maybe below the cockles, maybe in the sub-cockle

02:25:57.300 --> 02:26:04.300
Maybe in the liver, maybe in the kidneys, maybe even in the colon, we don't know.

02:26:07.300 --> 02:26:12.300
I'm just a regular Joe with a regular job.

02:26:12.300 --> 02:26:16.300
I'm your average white suburbanite slum.

02:26:16.300 --> 02:26:20.300
I like football and porno and books about war.

02:26:20.300 --> 02:26:24.300
I got an average house with a nice hardwood floor.

02:26:24.300 --> 02:26:33.300
My wife and my job, my kids in my car, my feet on my table, and a Cuban cigar.

02:26:36.300 --> 02:26:41.300
But sometimes that just ain't enough to keep a man like me interested.

02:26:41.300 --> 02:26:42.300
Oh, no.

02:26:42.300 --> 02:26:43.300
No way.

02:26:43.300 --> 02:26:44.300
Uh-uh.

02:26:44.300 --> 02:26:49.300
No, I've gotta go out and have fun at someone else's expense.

02:26:49.300 --> 02:26:50.300
Oh, yeah.

02:26:50.300 --> 02:26:51.300
Yeah, yeah.

02:26:51.300 --> 02:26:52.300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:26:52.300 --> 02:26:57.300
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I drive really slow in the ultra-fast lane

02:26:57.300 --> 02:27:01.300
While people behind me are going insane

02:27:01.300 --> 02:27:05.300
I'm an echo, yo-yo, yo-yo, yo-yo

02:27:05.300 --> 02:27:09.300
I'm an echo, yo-yo, yo-yo, yo-yo

02:27:09.300 --> 02:27:14.300
I use public toilets and I piss on the seat

02:27:14.300 --> 02:27:18.300
I walk around in the summertime saying, how about this heat?

02:27:18.300 --> 02:27:22.540
I'm an ass-o-yo-yo-yo-yo

02:27:22.540 --> 02:27:26.900
I'm an ass-o-y-o-yo-yo-yo

02:27:26.900 --> 02:27:30.780
Sometimes I part in handicapped spaces

02:27:30.780 --> 02:27:34.720
While handicapped people make handicapped faces

02:27:34.720 --> 02:27:39.140
I'm an ass-o-yo-yo-yo-yo

02:27:39.140 --> 02:27:43.500
I'm an ass-o-yo-yo-yo-yo-yo

02:27:43.500 --> 02:27:47.060
Maybe I should be singing this song

02:27:47.060 --> 02:27:51.060
Ranting and raving and carrying on

02:27:51.060 --> 02:27:56.060
Maybe they're right when they tell me I'm wrong

02:27:59.060 --> 02:28:01.060
Nah, I'm a nesso

02:28:01.060 --> 02:28:05.060
I'm a nesso

02:28:05.060 --> 02:28:08.060
I'm a nesso

02:28:08.060 --> 02:28:09.060
You know what I'm gonna do?

02:28:09.060 --> 02:28:13.060
I'm gonna get myself a 1967 Cadillac Eldorado convertible

02:28:13.060 --> 02:28:16.060
Hot pink with a whale skin hop champ

02:28:16.060 --> 02:28:21.060
And all leather cow interior and big brown baby seal eyes for headlights, yeah!

02:28:21.060 --> 02:28:26.060
And I'm gonna drive around in that baby at 115 miles per hour gettin' one mile per gallon

02:28:26.060 --> 02:28:31.060
suckin' down porta-potta cheeseburgers from McDonald's and the old-fashioned non-biodegradable styrofoam containers

02:28:31.060 --> 02:28:35.060
And when I'm done suckin' down those greaseball burgers I'm gonna wipe my mouth with the American flag

02:28:35.060 --> 02:28:38.060
And then I'm gonna toss the styrofoam containers right out the side

02:28:38.060 --> 02:28:41.060
And there ain't a goddamn thing anybody can do about it, you know why?

02:28:41.060 --> 02:28:43.060
Because we got the bomb, that's why

02:28:43.060 --> 02:28:46.060
Two words, nuclear fucking weapons, OK?

02:28:46.060 --> 02:28:49.060
Russia, Germany, Romania, they can have all the democracy they want

02:28:49.060 --> 02:28:53.060
They can have a big democracy cakewalk right through the middle of the Inovins Square

02:28:53.060 --> 02:28:56.060
And it won't make a lick of difference because we ain't got the bombs, OK?

02:28:56.060 --> 02:28:58.060
John Wayne's not dead, he's frozen

02:28:58.060 --> 02:29:01.060
And as soon as we find a cure for cancer we're gonna thaw out that Duke

02:29:01.060 --> 02:29:02.060
And he's gonna be pretty pissed off

02:29:02.060 --> 02:29:04.060
You know why? Have you ever taken a cold shower?

02:29:04.060 --> 02:29:06.060
We multiply that by 15 million times

02:29:06.060 --> 02:29:08.060
That's how pissed off the Duke's gonna be

02:29:08.060 --> 02:29:11.060
I'm gonna get the Duke, and John Cascametti, and Lee Marvin

02:29:11.060 --> 02:29:16.060
Hey! Hey! Hey! You know, you really are an asshole.

02:29:16.060 --> 02:29:18.060
Why don't you just shut up and sing the song, pal?

02:29:18.060 --> 02:29:22.060
Come on, S-O-L-E-O-L-E-O-L-E-O

02:29:22.060 --> 02:29:27.060
Come on, S-O-L-E-O-L-E-O

02:29:27.060 --> 02:29:31.060
A-S-S-H-O-L-E, everybody

02:29:31.060 --> 02:29:35.060
A-S-S-H-O-L-E

02:29:35.060 --> 02:29:56.020
I'm an asshole, and I'm proud of it.

02:29:56.020 --> 02:30:03.020
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

02:30:26.020 --> 02:30:54.300
Alright, the

02:30:54.300 --> 02:30:59.120
Afterbirth the part of the show when the credits have faded to black and you think it's over

02:30:59.120 --> 02:31:04.560
but it's really not. We have to keep it kind of short tonight though because I gotta get

02:31:04.560 --> 02:31:10.240
on the road. But I don't know, anybody had anything they wanted to say here in this Afterbirth?

02:31:10.240 --> 02:31:19.240
I'm gonna go fold my laundry. Sounds like fun. And then anything else you wanted to

02:31:19.240 --> 02:31:24.640
any anything off the record in the afterbirth the show not really I figured

02:31:24.640 --> 02:31:31.560
as much I'm kind of tired we're all exhausted we're spent I guess I could

02:31:31.560 --> 02:31:35.200
open up Skype and see if anybody has anything they want to say during this

02:31:35.200 --> 02:31:38.720
afterbirth I hope you guys enjoyed the premiere and all that fun stuff tonight

02:31:38.720 --> 02:31:44.600
it's fun getting to do stuff like that I hope we get to do more we'll soon see I

02:31:44.600 --> 02:31:47.840
do hear that there is some good stuff coming up for the show but I can't I

02:31:47.840 --> 02:31:52.160
I can't talk about it or they might send the mob after me, so that's all I'm going to say

02:31:52.160 --> 02:31:53.160
for right now.

02:31:53.160 --> 02:31:55.520
Yep, yep.

02:31:55.520 --> 02:32:00.560
I enjoy talking to myself on air, isn't it exciting?

02:32:00.560 --> 02:32:06.240
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

02:32:06.240 --> 02:32:09.440
I don't know what the hell that was.

02:32:09.440 --> 02:32:11.560
She has a binder clip!

02:32:11.560 --> 02:32:12.560
Yeah.

02:32:12.560 --> 02:32:13.560
No.

02:32:13.560 --> 02:32:18.560
No, I'm not singing the man song.

02:32:18.560 --> 02:32:23.560
Alright.

02:32:23.560 --> 02:32:25.560
There we go, Jamie's singing it.

02:32:25.560 --> 02:32:27.560
Somebody was singing, was Jamie singing it in the back?

02:32:27.560 --> 02:32:29.560
Man, man, man.

02:32:29.560 --> 02:32:32.560
No, must be the titties.

02:32:32.560 --> 02:32:34.560
That needs to be in Karaoke Revolution.

02:32:34.560 --> 02:32:36.560
Oh yeah, that needs to be in Karaoke Revolution.

02:32:36.560 --> 02:32:38.560
It's not going to be in Karaoke Revolution.

02:32:38.560 --> 02:32:40.560
Along with Murmur Twins.

02:32:40.560 --> 02:32:43.960
Alright, that's it. Forget it.

02:32:43.960 --> 02:32:48.160
We're spent.

02:32:48.160 --> 02:32:51.280
Oh, I'm gonna give head to one of the Loki's joysticks.

02:32:51.280 --> 02:32:56.760
Oh, you should. Alright, for the post-show tonight, you get a

02:32:56.760 --> 02:33:01.000
Bamani potpourri. It's a little bit of everything, commercial-free.

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:04.080
Enjoy, have a great night, thank you for tuning in,

02:33:04.080 --> 02:33:08.440
and we will see you again real soon, we hope.

02:33:08.440 --> 02:33:10.440
Good night.

02:34:38.440 --> 02:34:41.440
You're a cloud. You're duh-duh-duh.

02:34:41.440 --> 02:34:44.440
Oooh, duh-duh-duh-duh.

02:34:49.440 --> 02:34:52.440
If you're leaving me now,

02:34:52.440 --> 02:34:55.440
then I'm gonna be with you.

02:34:57.440 --> 02:34:58.440
New Music

02:34:58.440 --> 02:34:59.440
It's New!

02:34:59.440 --> 02:35:01.440
On Orange Lounge Radio

02:35:01.440 --> 02:35:04.440
Orangeloungeradio.com and ddrspot.com

02:35:04.440 --> 02:35:10.920
of teaming up to bring you this new song from TDR Extreme USA. This is Your Rain, the Rage

02:35:10.920 --> 02:35:29.920
You touched my body once, it burned You still solved me, never forget, never again will be

02:35:29.920 --> 02:35:36.920
I cried out of my head

02:35:36.920 --> 02:35:42.920
And I don't know what I found

02:35:42.920 --> 02:35:52.920
Over and over, I feel it break me down

02:35:52.920 --> 02:36:03.920
I'm waiting for a gentle wave, a gentle wave, a gentle wave

02:36:03.920 --> 02:36:08.920
On the sidewalk, on the city, on the streets just a whisper

02:36:08.920 --> 02:36:13.920
Busy people, going nowhere, steaming oak in the rain

02:36:13.920 --> 02:36:18.920
No compassion, nothing matters, my resistance is waning

02:36:18.920 --> 02:36:27.920
Like a flower in the basement, waiting for our love again

02:37:48.920 --> 02:37:53.020
You're the time I give, the place I give, my love

02:38:23.020 --> 02:38:51.420
We will, we will be young forever We are the ones who make it right

02:38:51.420 --> 02:38:54.860
We are the people of our time

02:38:54.860 --> 02:38:59.660
We hold our future in our hands

02:39:01.660 --> 02:39:05.100
We have the love to build a home

02:39:05.100 --> 02:39:08.540
Together we can have it all

02:39:08.540 --> 02:39:13.580
With every step we're moving on and on

02:39:14.940 --> 02:39:18.220
Standing up for everyone

02:39:18.220 --> 02:39:21.220
And won't you come around?

02:39:21.220 --> 02:39:25.220
You will be forever free

02:39:25.220 --> 02:39:28.220
When all is one and all is right

02:39:28.220 --> 02:39:35.220
We will, we will be home forever

02:39:35.220 --> 02:39:45.220
We will, we will be home forever

02:39:45.220 --> 02:39:49.220
Yeah, yeah

02:40:15.220 --> 02:40:34.220
Don't shine, I feel your energy, I need sunshine But it's not on me now Don't shine, don't you have to wait I want sunshine, it's just everything

02:40:34.220 --> 02:40:49.220
I need sunshine, I feel your energy I need sunshine, falling down on me now

02:40:49.220 --> 02:40:54.220
Sunshine, don't you hide away I want sunshine, each and every day

02:40:54.220 --> 02:41:00.220
Sunshine, I feel your energy I need sunshine, falling down on me now

02:41:00.220 --> 02:41:08.220
Now sometimes when you hide away I want some time to do it every day

02:41:30.220 --> 02:41:35.220
What's going on?

02:41:35.220 --> 02:41:44.220
What's going on?

02:41:44.220 --> 02:41:51.220
Dude I said, hey yeah, hey yeah

02:41:51.220 --> 02:41:59.220
I said hey, what's going on?

02:41:59.220 --> 02:42:22.540
25 years old, my life's in steel I'm trying to get up the creepy hill of old

02:42:22.540 --> 02:42:24.540
Our destination

02:42:27.040 --> 02:42:30.040
I realized we flew and I thought I'd choose

02:42:30.040 --> 02:42:34.540
That the world was made up of this brotherhood of men

02:42:36.540 --> 02:42:38.540
Or were there other dreams?

02:42:40.540 --> 02:42:42.540
Into a close-up time

02:42:42.540 --> 02:42:44.040
But I lied my friend

02:42:44.040 --> 02:42:47.540
Just to get it all out was in my head

02:42:47.540 --> 02:42:49.540
And I, I'm pretty

02:42:49.540 --> 02:42:52.540
A little peculiar

02:42:53.540 --> 02:42:57.540
Into a week in the morning when I step outside

02:42:57.540 --> 02:43:00.540
And I take a difference and I get real high

02:43:00.540 --> 02:43:03.540
And I swim to the top of my line

02:43:03.540 --> 02:43:06.540
What's going on?

02:43:07.540 --> 02:43:11.540
And I say hey, yeah, yeah

02:43:11.540 --> 02:43:14.540
Hey, yeah, yeah

02:43:14.540 --> 02:43:16.540
I say hey

02:43:16.540 --> 02:43:20.540
Hey, what's going on?

02:43:21.540 --> 02:43:26.540
I said hey, yeah, yeah

02:43:26.540 --> 02:43:29.540
Hey, yeah, yeah

02:43:29.540 --> 02:43:30.540
I say hey!

02:43:32.280 --> 02:43:34.280
What's going on?

02:43:39.120 --> 02:43:39.620
Come on!

02:43:39.620 --> 02:43:40.120
Nico Meow!

02:43:40.120 --> 02:43:40.620
Meow!

02:43:40.620 --> 02:43:41.120
Meow!

02:43:41.120 --> 02:43:41.620
Nico Meow!

02:43:42.120 --> 02:43:42.620

02:43:42.620 --> 02:43:43.120

02:43:44.620 --> 02:43:45.120

02:43:45.120 --> 02:43:46.620
Oh, Ash!

02:43:46.620 --> 02:43:49.620
This randomness could only be brought to you by Orange Lounge.

02:43:49.620 --> 02:43:51.620
YEAH!

02:44:19.620 --> 02:44:22.620
And bring my wagons around

02:44:22.620 --> 02:44:27.620
Move it out to the man in the sky of the trees

02:44:27.620 --> 02:44:33.620
Move it out when nobody wants to beat anyone

02:44:33.620 --> 02:44:36.620
And nobody's backing me

02:44:36.620 --> 02:44:38.620
I wanna be with the creatures of dreams

02:44:38.620 --> 02:44:41.620
I'll stand by the stars, drop the rain, but I say

02:44:41.620 --> 02:44:46.620
Grab what you can, we'll hand for the wildcat tree

02:46:16.620 --> 02:46:18.620
We

02:47:16.620 --> 02:47:34.620
So many days we wasted under the sky, watching the sun go up and come back again.

02:47:34.620 --> 02:47:38.620
So many nights we end with a complete start

02:47:41.620 --> 02:47:44.620
Aren't you really a light that she

02:47:44.620 --> 02:47:47.620
Should have in her heart?

02:47:47.620 --> 02:47:50.620
With you, with you, with you

02:47:50.620 --> 02:47:53.620
The universe is on its side

02:47:53.620 --> 02:47:57.620
I wanna be with you, with you, with you

02:47:57.620 --> 02:48:01.620
Wherever you are, with you in my heart

02:48:01.620 --> 02:48:04.620
Why do we speak out loud like this?

02:48:04.620 --> 02:48:08.620
I'd love to share the little more by talking

02:48:08.620 --> 02:48:12.620
How can we keep repeating the same old lies?

02:48:12.620 --> 02:48:15.620
You and I make everything feel so new

02:48:15.620 --> 02:48:18.620
Why do we speak out loud like this?

02:48:18.620 --> 02:48:22.620
I wanna spend the rest of my life with you

02:48:22.620 --> 02:48:26.620
How do we know we'll be together?

02:48:26.620 --> 02:48:29.620
I wanna do it this way next

02:48:31.620 --> 02:48:37.620
But I don't wanna do nothing to you

02:48:38.620 --> 02:48:40.620
A little moment

02:48:40.620 --> 02:48:45.620
Make up in the wild

02:49:45.620 --> 02:49:57.620
I need you, I want you, I will love to you

02:50:27.620 --> 02:50:31.620
We be the punch to be found, to be found, found, found, found

02:50:41.120 --> 02:50:44.120
That's right, Joey Drake joined one

02:50:44.620 --> 02:50:47.620
Before there were words, communication was done through feet

02:50:48.620 --> 02:50:50.620
Body language is controlled by rhythm

02:50:51.620 --> 02:50:53.620
Music is a universal link

02:50:53.620 --> 02:50:57.620
Feel this, feel these, uh, uh

02:50:57.620 --> 02:50:59.620
Think of this world without sound

02:50:59.620 --> 02:51:01.620
Can't even feel a heart pound

02:51:01.620 --> 02:51:04.620
Wasting time, wasting lives, wasting self

02:51:04.620 --> 02:51:07.620
Show me your health, show me your drum and I'll beat on it

02:51:07.620 --> 02:51:09.620
Work the guitar, I'll trade

02:51:09.620 --> 02:51:11.620
Show me your soul, work, lose control

02:51:11.620 --> 02:51:14.620
And the dude that can't be getting through this

02:51:14.620 --> 02:51:16.620
Yeah, that's right, come on

02:51:16.620 --> 02:51:19.620
I can't hear you, what, what

02:51:19.620 --> 02:51:21.620
I can't feel you, what, come on

02:51:21.620 --> 02:51:23.620
Throw it up!

02:51:23.620 --> 02:51:25.620
Get busy!

02:51:25.620 --> 02:51:27.620
Get busy! That's right!

02:51:27.620 --> 02:51:29.620
Here we go, y'all!

02:51:29.620 --> 02:51:31.620
Make music!

02:51:31.620 --> 02:51:33.620
Give me your time and I'll bend it!

02:51:33.620 --> 02:51:35.620
Tell me your name and I'll say it!

02:51:35.620 --> 02:51:37.620
Where's the air, I'll blow it!

02:51:37.620 --> 02:51:39.620
The last time would I, that's it!

02:51:39.620 --> 02:51:41.620
Burn some mic, I'll rip it!

02:51:41.620 --> 02:51:43.620
Show me the club, it's on!

02:51:43.620 --> 02:51:45.620
Get me a line, I'll send it!

02:51:45.620 --> 02:51:47.620
The last time would I, and I'm back!

02:51:47.620 --> 02:51:49.620
Where are you from? Where are you at?

02:51:49.620 --> 02:51:58.280
Just follow the beats, c'mon, just follow the beats, c'mon and bring the heat, yo

Do you want to be represented by Hollywood?

02:52:39.280 --> 02:52:41.280
No!

02:52:41.280 --> 02:52:43.280
Do we care what people think of us?

02:52:43.280 --> 02:52:45.280
No!

02:52:45.280 --> 02:52:47.280
Do we want people to kiss our ass?

02:52:47.280 --> 02:52:49.280
Yes!

02:52:49.280 --> 02:52:56.280

My time

03:10:59.480 --> 03:11:00.480
With my friends

03:11:00.480 --> 03:11:02.480
We must lift our hands

03:11:02.480 --> 03:11:04.480
To win this for you

03:12:04.480 --> 03:12:06.100
Duck up on the twine and

03:12:07.100 --> 03:12:08.980
This is a pleasure, yes I do

03:12:08.980 --> 03:12:11.480
It's a pleasure, it's a bad love for me

03:12:11.480 --> 03:12:12.980
For me

03:12:12.980 --> 03:12:14.980
I lay hold and lay in the forest

03:12:14.980 --> 03:12:15.980

03:12:27.480 --> 03:12:28.980
Funny robins

03:12:28.980 --> 03:12:30.480
You need a nice old prairie

03:12:30.480 --> 03:12:31.980
A good fresh cherry

03:12:31.980 --> 03:12:33.980
You need me for me

03:18:33.980 --> 03:18:51.980
Welcome to the broken door, welcome to the fame of this whole night

03:18:51.980 --> 03:18:57.980
Come on lady, come on girl, come on lady, tell me what's right

03:18:57.980 --> 03:18:58.480
Right

03:19:00.980 --> 03:19:04.080
I'm not the danger, not the pleasure stranger

03:19:04.080 --> 03:19:06.680
Rockin' rockin' rockin' like a silver star

03:19:06.680 --> 03:19:08.280
I'm on the link my name

I'll make it if you know how

03:19:10.180 --> 03:19:13.380
I'd like to be in prison for this

03:19:13.380 --> 03:19:15.080
Night's on fire

03:19:15.080 --> 03:19:16.680
You better better think

03:19:16.680 --> 03:19:19.580
You better better begin the phrase to say

03:19:19.580 --> 03:19:21.380
Night's on fire

03:19:21.380 --> 03:19:22.880
You're the one with me

03:19:22.880 --> 03:19:24.380
You're the one with the sight

03:19:24.380 --> 03:19:25.780
You never been here

03:19:25.780 --> 03:19:27.480
Night's on fire

03:19:27.480 --> 03:19:30.260
You've got a better place, you've got a better place

03:19:30.260 --> 03:19:33.600
In the frame to the flame, nightfall fire

03:19:33.600 --> 03:19:36.760
Come over for the rain, come over, over the sun

03:19:36.760 --> 03:19:38.920
You have a nightfall fire

03:20:38.920 --> 03:20:56.920
Oh, I know what you're here to say Have a simple day with me

03:20:56.920 --> 03:21:01.920
When the sun comes in the sky And the world is blue by the light

I thought it was a sin

03:30:25.540 --> 03:30:27.540

03:31:22.620 --> 03:31:34.620
He came to town by committing to a hero to the field

03:31:34.620 --> 03:31:39.620
So I came out strong, he was born to tell his father

03:31:39.620 --> 03:31:43.620
But all his trouble was having fun

03:31:43.620 --> 03:31:49.620
Where did you come from, where did you go?

03:31:49.620 --> 03:31:51.380

During my service in the United States of Congress, I took the initiative in creating the internet.

03:32:30.020 --> 03:32:31.020
You bastards!

03:32:31.020 --> 03:32:37.020
But you can't expect to wield supreme executive power just because some watery tart threw a sword at you?

03:32:37.020 --> 03:32:43.020
I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough whopper!

03:32:43.020 --> 03:32:45.020
Please, good people, I am in haste!

03:32:45.020 --> 03:32:47.020

03:36:40.020 --> 03:36:48.660
In the event of fire, let the night go by

03:36:48.660 --> 03:36:54.420
And wake up early, fall asleep

03:36:54.420 --> 03:37:04.660

Sometimes when you feel like the world is turning without you

03:43:30.660 --> 03:43:34.660
And you believe it won't make it

03:43:34.660 --> 03:43:36.660

They'll show you whether we all feel better, we'll be together

03:43:54.660 --> 03:43:58.660
And know that the sand will be fine

03:44:01.660 --> 03:44:05.660
Know that the sand will be fine

03:44:08.660 --> 03:44:10.660
Know that the sand will be fine

03:44:10.660 --> 03:44:17.660
All of the day when the sun shines on everyone but you

03:44:17.660 --> 03:44:23.660
It's open your heart to a friend and the light comes your way

03:44:23.660 --> 03:44:29.660

No other man will be fine

03:45:23.660 --> 03:45:25.660
No other man will be fine

03:45:26.660 --> 03:45:28.660
Go, go, daylight, go!

03:45:28.660 --> 03:45:31.660
This is all the end here, monster

03:46:01.660 --> 03:46:08.660
It can be sorrow, light and deception But it can keep you trading on evolution

03:46:08.660 --> 03:46:14.660
Go, go, deluxe, go You're missing me but I'm still a star hero

03:46:14.660 --> 03:46:20.660
Go, go, deluxe, go For the people, for the planet

03:46:20.660 --> 03:46:26.660
Go, go, deluxe, go You're missing me but I'm still a star hero

03:47:26.660 --> 03:47:43.660
Don't say it's like a fantasy When you know this is how it should be

03:47:43.660 --> 03:47:50.660
You kiss me, I'm falling Can you hear me calling?

03:47:50.660 --> 03:47:54.660
You touch me, I want to

03:47:54.660 --> 03:47:58.660
Feels like I've always known you

03:47:58.660 --> 03:48:01.660
I wanna die like this

03:48:01.660 --> 03:48:05.660
I wanna stay forever

03:48:05.660 --> 03:48:08.660
I wanna die like this

03:48:08.660 --> 03:48:11.660
Just wanna be together

03:48:11.660 --> 03:48:14.660
On a night like this

03:48:20.660 --> 03:48:31.660
Now I'm getting closer to you for me

03:48:31.660 --> 03:48:35.660
I just can't be without you

03:48:35.660 --> 03:48:39.660
You can't see I'm falling

03:48:39.660 --> 03:48:43.160
It's your name I'm calling

03:48:43.160 --> 03:48:46.660
You touch me, I want you

03:48:46.660 --> 03:48:50.160
Feels like I've always known you

03:48:50.160 --> 03:48:53.160
What a life life is

03:48:53.160 --> 03:48:55.660
I wanna stay forever

03:48:55.660 --> 03:48:57.660
Stay forever

03:48:57.660 --> 03:49:00.660
What a life life is

03:49:00.660 --> 03:49:03.160
Just wanna be together

03:49:03.160 --> 03:49:06.160
What a life life is

03:49:06.160 --> 03:49:10.160
I've known you a lifetime

03:49:13.160 --> 03:49:18.160
Now it's time to make you mine

03:49:18.160 --> 03:49:24.160
Oh, I'm not my friend

03:49:25.160 --> 03:49:30.160
Oh, I'm not my friend

03:49:30.160 --> 03:49:59.160
I want to stay forever, stay forever I want to be together, on a night like this

03:51:59.160 --> 03:52:24.520
You keep on walking on the other side, other side, other side

03:52:24.520 --> 03:52:30.520
You keep on walking on the other side, other side, other side

03:52:30.520 --> 03:52:37.520
Wherever you go, I'm coming with you Shouldn't you know, I'm bound to follow

03:52:37.520 --> 03:52:45.520
Whatever you say, whatever you do I'll give you a clue, I'm gonna follow

03:52:45.520 --> 03:52:52.520
And the sun will shine when the water flows

03:52:52.520 --> 03:53:00.520
When the problems grow, that's where I need you

03:53:00.520 --> 03:53:22.120
Why don't you let me, let me come along Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah

03:53:22.120 --> 03:53:28.120
Why don't you over make me come along Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah

03:53:28.120 --> 03:53:31.720
Wherever you go, I'm going for you

I'll have a smoothie for to follow

03:53:35.120 --> 03:53:38.720
And firewood and paper and glue

03:53:38.720 --> 03:53:42.920
I and you are for to follow

03:53:42.920 --> 03:53:47.520
Oh, and the stars will show

03:53:47.520 --> 03:53:50.920
Where the waters flow

03:53:50.920 --> 03:53:54.520
Where the gardens grow

03:53:54.520 --> 03:53:57.920
That's where I'll meet you

03:53:57.920 --> 03:54:04.720
And the sun will glow, melting all the snow

03:54:04.720 --> 03:54:12.720
No, no, I know, that's where I'll need you

03:54:12.720 --> 03:54:20.720
That's where I'll be with you

03:54:20.720 --> 03:54:26.720
Yeah

03:54:26.720 --> 03:54:36.720
That's where I'll be with you

03:54:36.720 --> 03:54:40.720
Woah, woah

03:54:44.720 --> 03:54:48.720
Woah

03:54:48.720 --> 03:54:58.720
That's where I'll be with you

03:55:28.720 --> 03:55:30.720
Oh

03:56:28.720 --> 03:56:37.040
She told me, oh, get your ass, get your ass

03:58:28.720 --> 03:58:31.720
Kuta, kuta, kuta, ee-oh, ee-oh

03:58:52.720 --> 03:58:55.720
One day when I got the weed, I told you with the cops

03:58:55.720 --> 03:58:59.160
I'd like to be a king of Gandhi, who lives in Kathmandu

03:58:59.160 --> 03:59:02.760
Uncle Gandhi, he is rich, he's the tightest kind of man

03:59:02.760 --> 03:59:06.360
And I know that he will help me, as much as he can

03:59:06.360 --> 03:59:09.640
A king is like a man, he's what I want to be

03:59:09.640 --> 03:59:13.320
After all, I've got him, but you want to ride with me

03:59:13.320 --> 03:59:16.760
I don't know why it's okay that I'm on a fight

03:59:16.760 --> 03:59:20.520
But every speed in Kathmandu is a fight

03:59:20.520 --> 03:59:28.520
I am a sexy star, but I am a good star I play my little sexy in the good star

03:59:28.520 --> 03:59:35.520
I'm a sexy sexy sexy in the good star I am a sexy girl in my age

03:59:35.520 --> 03:59:53.280
I like it very much, even though I have no license

03:59:53.280 --> 03:59:56.520
I always find a clutch, I can bind it up my hands

03:59:56.520 --> 04:00:01.400
I can bind it up my feet, and I have no problem getting dirty

04:01:31.400 --> 04:01:41.400
I am a sexy darling man

04:02:01.400 --> 04:02:01.900
Hey!

04:02:17.400 --> 04:02:20.400
You can feel my heart, what you feel deep inside

04:02:20.400 --> 04:02:23.400
And it feels the best, baby, my, my, my, my

04:02:23.400 --> 04:02:26.400
It's the sense of your soul, that you try to relieve

04:02:26.400 --> 04:02:29.400
You never understand your heart, it functions

04:02:29.400 --> 04:02:31.400
Feel it, feel it, baby

04:02:31.400 --> 04:02:35.400
Feel the fire, it's burning deep inside me

04:02:35.400 --> 04:02:37.400
Listen, listen, honey

04:02:37.400 --> 04:02:40.400
Listen to, come listen to you

04:02:40.400 --> 04:02:42.400
Listen to the heartbeat

04:02:42.400 --> 04:02:44.400
Whoa-oh-oh

04:02:44.400 --> 04:02:46.400
You better take your chance right now

04:02:46.400 --> 04:02:48.400
Listen to the heartbeat

04:02:48.400 --> 04:02:50.400
And let it go

04:02:50.400 --> 04:02:52.400
You can follow that if you find it cool

04:02:52.400 --> 04:02:54.400
Listen to the heartbeat

04:02:54.400 --> 04:02:56.400
Whoa-oh-oh

04:02:56.400 --> 04:02:59.400
You better take your chances right now

04:02:59.400 --> 04:03:01.400
Dance to the heartbeat

04:03:01.400 --> 04:03:02.900
And let it go

04:03:02.900 --> 04:03:05.400
You can follow that and you'll find it cool

04:03:05.400 --> 04:03:20.400
This is a heartbeat

04:03:35.400 --> 04:03:39.400
Push, you'll never walk, go home

04:03:39.400 --> 04:03:42.400
Get every one of them to set a set of steps

04:03:42.400 --> 04:03:45.400
From the bottom of the top, the camera top

04:03:45.400 --> 04:03:49.400
To the jiggy old guy, the villain's got his top

04:03:49.400 --> 04:03:52.400
No matter what, I never thought that

04:03:52.400 --> 04:03:56.400
Daddy didn't want a really smart guy

04:03:56.400 --> 04:04:01.400
But that is something we all know

04:05:01.400 --> 04:05:03.400
You

04:06:01.400 --> 04:06:03.400
You

04:07:01.400 --> 04:07:08.400
.

04:07:08.400 --> 04:07:15.400
.

04:07:15.400 --> 04:07:22.400
.

04:07:22.400 --> 04:07:29.400

04:07:29.400 --> 04:07:31.400
You

04:07:59.400 --> 04:08:13.400
The following bit of randomness has been brought to you by Orange Lounge Radio.

04:08:13.400 --> 04:08:14.400
Dateline, the Muppet Show.

04:08:14.400 --> 04:08:18.880
It has been reported just moments ago that a large heavy object was dropped from the

04:08:18.880 --> 04:08:19.880
ceiling.

04:08:19.880 --> 04:08:20.880
Further developments will...

04:08:20.880 --> 04:08:21.880
Hey, did you boil it down there?

04:08:21.880 --> 04:08:22.880
That's the biggest thing I've ever seen, Diggleberry.

04:08:22.880 --> 04:08:24.880
The best berry ever seen, Diggleberry!

04:11:22.880 --> 04:11:41.560

But baby, take it easy

04:13:49.280 --> 04:13:51.980

When you're cool and just relax, relax

04:15:01.280 --> 04:15:03.280
I gotta warm you up

04:15:04.280 --> 04:15:08.280

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Sometimes I feel I'm gonna break down and cry

04:15:18.280 --> 04:15:20.280
No way to go nothing to do with my time

04:15:21.280 --> 04:15:23.280
I get lonely

04:15:23.280 --> 04:15:29.280
So lonely, little man

04:15:29.280 --> 04:15:56.640
Sometimes I feel I'm gonna break down and cry

04:15:56.640 --> 04:16:07.640
The weather's gonna seem to do it my time I get lonely, so lonely, living on my own

04:16:07.640 --> 04:16:13.640
Sometimes I feel I'm always walking too fast And everything is gonna sound almost out on me

04:16:13.640 --> 04:16:19.640
I go easy, on some places

04:16:19.640 --> 04:16:26.640
Livin' on my own

04:16:26.640 --> 04:16:29.640
Come on baby, he don't have it

04:16:29.640 --> 04:16:30.640
He don't have it

04:16:30.640 --> 04:16:32.640
I don't have the time

04:16:32.640 --> 04:16:34.640
For a monkey today

04:16:34.640 --> 04:16:36.640
He don't have it

04:16:36.640 --> 04:16:37.640
He don't have it

04:16:37.640 --> 04:16:41.640
He's a lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, hey

04:16:41.640 --> 04:16:46.640
Hey, you can take some good times, I ain't one to blame

04:17:03.640 --> 04:17:06.640
Can't you feel my body gives me the warning

04:17:06.640 --> 04:17:12.640
But my head is always up and wild to the dream world

04:17:12.640 --> 04:17:18.640
It's not easy to live with a mother

04:17:20.640 --> 04:17:23.640
She don't have it, she don't have it

04:17:23.640 --> 04:17:27.640
I don't have the time or the money to be saved

04:17:27.640 --> 04:17:30.640
She don't have it, she don't have it

04:17:30.640 --> 04:17:34.640
It's a lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, yeah

04:17:34.640 --> 04:17:37.640
Got to fix what's on my head

04:17:37.640 --> 04:17:40.640
He don't have it, he don't have it

04:17:40.640 --> 04:17:42.640
I don't care, I'm up and down

04:17:42.640 --> 04:17:44.640
Oh, oh, oh, give me that

04:17:44.640 --> 04:17:47.640
He don't have it, he don't have it

04:17:47.640 --> 04:17:51.640
I said so lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, yeah

04:18:21.640 --> 04:18:28.640
Let's go for it, right now I'm gone Let's go for it, right now I'm gone

04:18:51.640 --> 04:18:53.640
You can't sit

04:18:53.640 --> 04:18:56.640
All of this was the beginning

04:18:56.640 --> 04:18:59.640
It was the end of the year

04:18:59.640 --> 04:19:00.640
The sky is falling, eyes are falling

04:19:00.640 --> 04:19:02.640
You have no chance to make a mess

04:19:02.640 --> 04:19:03.640
Love is a bust, life don't love

04:19:03.640 --> 04:19:04.640
The blues are a bust

04:19:04.640 --> 04:19:05.640
We was on the cusp

04:19:05.640 --> 04:19:06.640
Crying out for more than a year

04:19:06.640 --> 04:19:07.640
And I turned around and had no fear

04:19:07.640 --> 04:19:09.640
Believe me, because I'll show you the way

04:19:09.640 --> 04:19:10.640
Woo, woo

04:19:10.640 --> 04:19:11.640
Some people think that it's too late

04:19:11.640 --> 04:19:13.640
It's so scary, let's wait and see

04:19:13.640 --> 04:19:14.640
The world will shut down, all the world will win

04:19:14.640 --> 04:19:16.640
People are afraid they need to get bit

04:19:16.640 --> 04:19:17.640
Fire at the top, don't know where to stop

04:19:17.640 --> 04:19:18.640
Let it pop, nah, stop, stop

04:19:18.640 --> 04:19:20.640
Remember these words are what I said

04:19:20.640 --> 04:19:21.840
It's just why we come free

04:19:21.840 --> 04:19:24.340
Just feel it, feel it

04:19:24.340 --> 04:19:26.340
It's amazing

04:19:26.340 --> 04:19:28.840
Oh boy, I want to lose

04:19:28.840 --> 04:19:30.840
Nobody gets me

04:19:33.340 --> 04:19:35.840
Some just say the world is changing

04:19:35.840 --> 04:19:38.840
Many people will come in

04:19:38.840 --> 04:19:41.840
Many changes we are seeing

04:19:41.840 --> 04:19:44.840
I just say it's the end, the end, the end

04:19:44.840 --> 04:19:46.840
I'll just enjoy it

04:21:46.840 --> 04:21:48.840

Let's just go, stay true

04:23:07.840 --> 04:23:12.840
To the sound of our eyes, our eyes

04:23:12.840 --> 04:23:42.520
Can you hear me from above Do you feel the same inside of me?

04:23:42.520 --> 04:23:50.520
Flashing through the window in the air

04:23:50.520 --> 04:23:59.520
Just in time, no one cares to die

04:23:59.520 --> 04:24:07.520
Can you see me from above?

04:24:07.520 --> 04:24:16.520
Do you share my frozen memory with the stars?

04:24:16.520 --> 04:24:28.520
Leaving me alone, darling just staying all alone

04:24:28.520 --> 04:24:32.520
Let us not face me

04:24:32.520 --> 04:24:37.520
Please give me brand new star tonight

04:24:37.520 --> 04:24:43.520

Please give me rain from yesterday

04:24:52.520 --> 04:24:54.520

04:24:54.520 --> 04:24:58.520
Take my hand

04:25:24.520 --> 04:25:41.520
Can you watch me fall above, knowing someone keeps coming along,

04:25:41.520 --> 04:25:43.520
Woe me free

04:25:45.520 --> 04:25:48.520
Never seem to come

04:25:49.520 --> 04:25:51.520
Cover me

04:25:52.520 --> 04:25:56.520
Spring us far away

04:25:58.520 --> 04:26:02.520
Can you guide me for my vow?

04:26:02.520 --> 04:26:26.520
All I need is just a little light, don't worry I won't stand for that yellow's watch, hiding all I need

04:26:32.520 --> 04:26:56.520
Let us not thank me, please keep me round You look what I just began, was born

04:26:56.520 --> 04:27:00.520
Let us not take me

04:27:00.520 --> 04:27:04.520
Please keep me brave for what a ride

04:27:04.520 --> 04:27:12.520
Might for me take my hand

04:27:12.520 --> 04:27:21.520
Let it not take me

04:27:42.520 --> 04:27:56.160

Cause you never know when it's your turn to take a time

04:32:07.360 --> 04:32:13.360
So you go, you stay with your eyes in the back of your head

04:32:13.360 --> 04:32:19.360

04:50:40.560 --> 04:50:48.040
it all the time I'm living in a sad world, but I know what's

04:50:48.040 --> 04:50:59.040
on my mind. I am free as a bird, even though you tell me that I can't fly. I ain't easy

04:50:59.040 --> 04:51:08.040
to hurt, I have a perfect life and I'm telling you why. I'm a cowgirl, and I'm riding on

Lay all your love on me

I was done I feel that now what you've done with me

04:54:50.400 --> 04:54:54.600
I'm from a world that you'd never fall so deep in

04:54:57.000 --> 04:54:58.600
I feel a lot of fear

04:55:00.400 --> 04:55:02.000
When I don't have your fear

04:55:04.000 --> 04:55:05.600
I'm satisfied

I've had a few little love affairs

04:55:44.400 --> 04:55:49.400
They didn't last very long and they've been pretty dense

04:55:51.400 --> 04:55:54.400
I used to think that was sensible

04:55:55.400 --> 04:55:59.400
Expect the truth even more, it's all preventable

04:56:01.400 --> 04:56:03.400
But everything is new

04:56:05.400 --> 04:56:07.400
And everything is true

04:56:08.400 --> 04:56:10.400
And all I try

04:56:10.400 --> 04:56:16.400
In all my time, what can I do?

04:56:17.400 --> 04:56:24.400
Don't go wasting your emotions

05:05:07.880 --> 05:05:10.880
I'm a kingdom like y'all so closer, a rollercoaster

05:05:10.880 --> 05:05:12.880
About this time I'll be the suggestion

05:05:12.880 --> 05:05:14.880
Get on my damn foot to use this wreckin' it's hot

05:05:14.880 --> 05:05:16.880
And when I find it, fire

05:05:16.880 --> 05:05:19.880
Realize my fire

05:05:19.880 --> 05:05:22.880
You're lovin' up on me

05:05:22.880 --> 05:05:23.880
Realize your

05:05:23.880 --> 05:05:26.880
Realize your fire

05:05:26.880 --> 05:05:30.880
For me

05:05:30.880 --> 05:05:34.880
Realize my fire

05:05:34.880 --> 05:05:38.880
Your love is upon the designer

05:05:38.880 --> 05:05:40.880
Realizing the fire

05:05:40.880 --> 05:05:44.880
From underneath

05:07:14.880 --> 05:07:18.360
And I, I'm gonna let her go on me

05:07:18.360 --> 05:07:20.780
I'm gonna let her know that I can't

05:07:20.780 --> 05:07:25.780
Don't you leave, that's what I can't talk about

05:07:50.780 --> 05:08:19.780
Kicking from a rainy Thursday on the Avenue I thought I heard you talking so slow

05:08:19.780 --> 05:08:26.780
I sit on the lights, the TV and the radio

05:08:26.780 --> 05:08:33.780
Still I can't escape the ghost of you

05:08:33.780 --> 05:08:36.780
What is happening to it all?

05:08:36.780 --> 05:08:40.780
Crazy sometimes

05:08:40.780 --> 05:08:46.780
Where is the light that I recognize?

05:08:46.780 --> 05:08:51.780
It's gone away, but I won't cry for yesterday

05:08:51.780 --> 05:09:01.780
There's an ordinary world, somehow I have to find

05:09:01.780 --> 05:09:09.780
And as I try to make my way to the ordinary world

05:09:09.780 --> 05:09:16.780
I will learn to survive

05:09:39.780 --> 05:09:44.780
In the mist of a tropical mountain

05:09:46.780 --> 05:09:49.780
Why do you cry when you're happy?

05:09:49.780 --> 05:09:53.780
It's just something special

05:09:53.780 --> 05:10:00.780
Why do you see why I don't keep talking in the blue sky?

05:10:01.780 --> 05:10:04.780
Yeah, it's so much because

05:10:04.780 --> 05:10:08.780
It's so much imagination

05:10:38.780 --> 05:10:42.000
Yeah, it's so much because

05:10:42.000 --> 05:10:45.580
It's our fascination

05:10:45.580 --> 05:10:49.320
I have a secret to I really need

05:10:49.320 --> 05:10:52.840
Can you please leave us with the fear?

05:10:54.840 --> 05:10:56.840
Are you with me all the way?

05:11:56.840 --> 05:11:58.840
Oh

05:12:56.840 --> 05:13:03.840
Kissing blue heather, most of all to me

05:13:03.840 --> 05:13:11.840
Kissing blue heather, blessed is the memory

05:13:11.840 --> 05:13:16.840
Make me do it any other way

05:14:46.840 --> 05:14:55.840
Oh, some with eggs on the mountaintop The most dearest monkey to ever meet

05:14:55.840 --> 05:15:03.840
He knows every magic trick under the sun He's the guy that everyone can have some fun

05:15:03.840 --> 05:15:12.840
Monkey magic, monkey magic Monkey magic, monkey magic

05:15:42.840 --> 05:15:52.840
He knew every magic under the sun He forgot that everyone had some fun

05:15:52.840 --> 05:16:09.840
Monkey magic, monkey magic

05:16:22.840 --> 05:16:38.840
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

05:16:38.840 --> 05:16:45.840
I sing about you almost every day My mind is made up by me tonight and day

05:16:45.840 --> 05:16:51.840
You're my obsession but I wait in line I'll pretend until then that I'm doing fine

05:16:51.840 --> 05:17:01.840
I know that my feelings show, but I guess that's the way to let you know I'm you

05:17:01.840 --> 05:17:04.840
What else can I do?

05:17:04.840 --> 05:17:11.840
You want my fantasy, you want my energy

05:17:11.840 --> 05:17:18.840
Baby can't you see that you belong to me

05:17:18.840 --> 05:17:20.840
And it ain't love

05:17:33.840 --> 05:17:35.840
I was waiting for the moment in time

05:17:35.840 --> 05:17:39.840
And the moment came up to make you mine

05:17:39.840 --> 05:17:43.840
I gotta have you, I need you baby

05:17:43.840 --> 05:17:46.840
One look in your eyes and I gotta say

05:17:46.840 --> 05:17:49.840
I know that my feelings show

05:17:49.840 --> 05:17:54.840
But I guess that's the way to let you know I need you

05:17:56.840 --> 05:17:58.840
What else can I do?

05:17:59.840 --> 05:18:02.840
You are my fantasy

05:18:02.840 --> 05:18:26.840
You are my fantasy, you are my energy Baby, can't you see that you belong to me?

05:18:26.840 --> 05:18:52.200
Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song, Orange Lounge Radio.

05:19:26.840 --> 05:19:30.340
I'm an angry creep

05:19:32.840 --> 05:19:38.340
There's a key over me to the bed

05:19:39.340 --> 05:19:43.340
You are, I'm an angry creep

05:19:46.340 --> 05:19:51.340
There's a little door behind me

05:21:21.340 --> 05:21:33.740
What you doing over there, come on, let's do this for the F.

05:21:33.740 --> 05:21:41.060
What you got in your hand, this man is amazing, put it away, it's gonna go bang, blow my brain,

05:21:41.060 --> 05:21:42.060
ha.

05:21:42.060 --> 05:21:48.060
So let's leave a little bit today, just tryin' to get a little bit of space for it to happen.

05:21:48.060 --> 05:21:49.340
You know I ain't laughing, it's like a game

05:21:49.340 --> 05:21:50.840
Just how long is it gonna stay sane?

05:21:50.840 --> 05:21:51.840
Cut the blood!

05:22:20.840 --> 05:22:46.760
All the days where we just played Back in school, just me and you

05:22:46.760 --> 05:22:53.760
But I can't forget you now What am I supposed to do?

05:22:53.760 --> 05:23:00.760
We can be mother friends Do you know I'm here for you?

05:23:00.760 --> 05:23:07.760
Cause you're so easy to love When you smile the skies are blue

05:23:07.760 --> 05:23:14.760

Oh I know we've been friends ever since school days have been

05:23:45.760 --> 05:23:49.760
When we first and when we first

05:23:49.760 --> 05:23:52.760
Simple words do cross my mind

05:23:52.760 --> 05:23:55.760

05:29:22.520 --> 05:29:24.520
Oh

Why? You leave me alone, so tell me why?

05:30:34.520 --> 05:30:43.520
There is no need to carry on, leave me alone if I'm not right

05:30:43.520 --> 05:30:51.520
And why? You leave me alone, so many days, you're thinking of you so many nights

05:30:51.520 --> 05:30:56.520
Leave me alone and don't know why

05:30:56.520 --> 05:30:58.520
Help me, why?

05:31:03.520 --> 05:31:05.520
Now tell me, why?

05:31:35.520 --> 05:31:40.520
I don't know what to say, but I'm not sure what to say.

05:31:40.520 --> 05:31:45.520
I don't know what to say, but I'm not sure what to say.

05:34:15.520 --> 05:34:22.520
Ready for the day

05:34:22.520 --> 05:34:34.520
Ready for the day

05:34:34.520 --> 05:34:44.520
Ready for the day

05:35:14.520 --> 05:35:19.900
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go

05:35:20.420 --> 05:35:28.440
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go

05:35:30.160 --> 05:35:36.260
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go

05:36:06.260 --> 05:36:08.260
Let me go

05:36:08.260 --> 05:36:23.440
Let me, let me, go Let me, let me, go

05:36:23.440 --> 05:36:30.440

Let me go

05:36:37.440 --> 05:36:44.440
Let me go

05:36:44.440 --> 05:37:10.200
Let it, let it go Let it, let it go

05:37:10.200 --> 05:37:11.920
Let it, let it go

Let it, let it go

05:37:16.680 --> 05:37:19.720
Let it, let it go

05:37:36.720 --> 05:37:38.320
Let it, let it go

05:38:38.320 --> 05:38:45.320
1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4!

05:39:08.320 --> 05:39:10.320
Oh

05:39:38.320 --> 05:39:43.320
I'm not sure you'll remember but, still

05:39:43.320 --> 05:39:44.520
I'm in a good mood

05:39:44.520 --> 05:39:46.520
Boy I just wanna know

05:39:46.520 --> 05:39:53.020
Don't want to go and give everything you're worth

05:39:53.020 --> 05:39:55.720
You won't be able to say something more

05:39:55.720 --> 05:40:01.060
I got anything connected

05:40:01.060 --> 05:40:01.980
You only know if I know

05:40:01.980 --> 05:39:52.220
Heaud I

05:40:02.320 --> 05:40:03.220
I can't

05:40:03.220 --> 05:40:05.120
I never want to get up

05:41:05.120 --> 05:41:23.460
1, 2, 3, 4,, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 21, 22,

If you like this video, please subscribe to my channel.

05:41:58.460 --> 05:42:00.460
Ain't ready for me

05:42:00.460 --> 05:42:03.460
I got a recipe I'm gonna share

05:42:03.460 --> 05:42:05.460
Come after me, you'll be better

05:44:03.460 --> 05:44:08.820
Caught up in the world, the world's a dark and rainy day

05:44:08.820 --> 05:44:13.220
Just to save yourself, all we live to learn

05:44:13.220 --> 05:44:16.020
A chemical can never be enough

05:44:16.020 --> 05:44:22.660
You need the thrill of love

05:44:22.660 --> 05:44:26.020
From there I feel the thrill

05:44:26.020 --> 05:44:29.500
We're here to come back

05:44:29.500 --> 05:44:36.260
We're here to feel the love

05:44:36.260 --> 05:44:39.660
We're here to feel the pain

05:44:39.660 --> 05:44:44.660
We can't come back

05:45:09.660 --> 05:45:35.340
I'm chemical love and I'm free from the infection More taste to taste mess with me and I'll bomb

05:45:35.340 --> 05:45:37.340
Let's just dance, don't give me room

05:45:37.340 --> 05:45:39.340
I'll do within my head this time

05:45:39.340 --> 05:45:41.340
When you drop to the floor

05:45:41.340 --> 05:45:43.340
Just as I pump some more

05:45:43.340 --> 05:45:45.340
Get the tension in your body to take a beat

05:45:45.340 --> 05:45:47.340
When I fall apart, it's time to knock that it's free

05:45:47.340 --> 05:45:49.340
You got to learn to bite me

05:45:49.340 --> 05:45:51.340
So you should beware

05:45:51.340 --> 05:45:53.340
with the flavor in the air

05:47:51.340 --> 05:48:17.340
Yeah, yeah, this is my music style

05:50:17.340 --> 05:50:19.840
Try for a stranger's aim

05:50:19.840 --> 05:50:23.340
Tonight I need to play a brand new game

05:50:23.340 --> 05:50:28.340
I know I'll find you, just look around you

05:50:28.340 --> 05:50:29.840
Come on!

05:50:29.840 --> 05:50:33.340
I spent tonight and all my dreams come true

05:50:33.340 --> 05:50:36.340
You never give a scene just for me to know

05:50:36.340 --> 05:50:41.840
You are the light in his eyes

05:50:41.840 --> 05:50:45.340
While your light makes me fly

05:50:45.340 --> 05:50:48.340
I'm gonna make you cry

05:50:48.340 --> 05:50:55.340
I want you to stay by my side

05:50:56.340 --> 05:50:59.340
Nothing's gonna stop me now tonight

05:50:59.340 --> 05:51:02.340
Nothing's gonna stop me now

05:51:02.340 --> 05:51:04.340
I'm crying for you

05:51:04.340 --> 05:51:08.340
I'm dreaming of you

05:51:09.340 --> 05:51:12.340
Nothing's gonna stop me now tonight

05:51:12.340 --> 05:51:15.340
Nothing's gonna stop me now

05:51:15.340 --> 05:51:18.340
I'll fly for you

05:51:18.340 --> 05:51:25.340
I'm living always on you

05:51:27.340 --> 05:51:30.340
Nothing, nothing

05:51:30.340 --> 05:51:34.340
Don't stop me now

05:51:34.340 --> 05:51:43.340
Do you believe in destiny?

05:51:43.340 --> 05:51:50.340
I close my eyes and dream that you are closer to me

05:51:50.340 --> 05:51:57.340
So follow me and you will see

05:51:57.340 --> 05:52:08.340
Together we can touch the sky, we're flying so high, high, higher

05:52:08.340 --> 05:52:23.340
Oh, do you believe?

05:52:23.340 --> 05:52:32.340
Oh, do you believe?

05:52:32.340 --> 05:52:38.340
I'll see you last night

05:52:39.340 --> 05:52:45.340
Until the morning sky

05:52:46.340 --> 05:52:51.340
The light inside my heart will last forever

05:52:52.340 --> 05:52:58.340
And in my dreams I'll never let you go

05:52:58.340 --> 05:53:05.340
I know you need to be with me

05:53:05.340 --> 05:53:12.340
When something feels so good, it's only a fantasy

05:53:12.340 --> 05:53:19.340
Every time I'm by, I wonder why

05:53:19.340 --> 05:53:26.340
Will you be here with me someday? I'll fade it away

05:53:26.340 --> 05:53:33.340
I feel alive tonight

05:53:33.340 --> 05:53:40.340
Until one is down

05:53:40.340 --> 05:53:47.340
The light inside my heart will last forever

05:53:47.340 --> 05:53:53.340
And in my dreams I'll never let you go

05:53:53.340 --> 05:53:57.340
Here we go

05:54:23.340 --> 05:54:49.340
I'll see the light tonight I'll see the morning sky

05:54:49.340 --> 05:54:55.340
The light inside my heart will last forever

05:54:56.340 --> 05:55:02.340
And in my dreams I'll never let you go

05:55:03.340 --> 05:55:09.340
I'm free and alive tonight

05:55:10.340 --> 05:55:16.340
Until the morning sky

05:55:16.340 --> 05:55:22.340
I decide my heart will last forever

05:55:23.340 --> 05:55:28.340
And in my dreams I'll never let you go

05:55:28.340 --> 05:55:54.960
I need you, baby I need you, baby

05:56:24.960 --> 05:56:41.960
I need you baby, I need you baby

05:56:54.960 --> 05:57:08.960
I need you baby, like a flower in the rain My life is like a dream, I'll be the same day

05:57:08.960 --> 05:57:13.960
Take you high, girl, and you'll never see me more You know me, Rosie, you'll be screaming out for more

05:57:13.960 --> 05:57:18.960
I need you baby, like a flower in the rain My life is like a dream, I'll be the same day

06:00:18.960 --> 06:00:20.960
You

06:00:48.960 --> 06:00:52.960
Happy day, happy day, happy day

06:00:52.960 --> 06:00:58.960
Save another day, I'm maybe a night away

06:00:58.960 --> 06:01:02.960
I'll be coming to you one day

06:01:02.960 --> 06:01:09.960
One day, one day, one day

06:01:09.960 --> 06:01:12.960
One day, one day, one day

06:01:42.960 --> 06:01:44.960
on me

06:06:12.960 --> 06:06:19.960
Let me know what you think in the comments below and I'll see you in the next video.

06:06:42.960 --> 06:06:44.960
You

06:11:42.960 --> 06:11:44.960
Oh

06:12:12.960 --> 06:12:17.960
Was there anything? Every night? I did it every night

06:12:17.960 --> 06:12:22.960
Oh, everyday, I was your everything

06:12:22.960 --> 06:12:25.960
Every night, I did it every night

06:12:25.960 --> 06:12:30.960
Oh, I was born again

06:12:33.960 --> 06:12:39.960
I'm a man, I'm a man

06:13:09.960 --> 06:13:12.460
I need to die, I die

06:13:12.460 --> 06:13:13.960
Use my heart, I die

06:13:13.960 --> 06:13:16.460
Use my mind in my head

06:13:16.460 --> 06:13:18.460
Use my heart, I die

06:13:18.460 --> 06:13:22.460
I think you'll remember

06:13:48.460 --> 06:14:06.460
Every night, I hear your voice Baby, every day and every night

06:15:48.460 --> 06:16:08.460
I see you how I feel it, my hustle's around me so please

06:16:08.460 --> 06:16:14.460
Take on the dream and stop me, take on the chance of working

06:16:14.460 --> 06:16:18.460
It's time to say goodbye to my face

06:16:18.460 --> 06:16:23.460
I want you to know that I'm ready to be empty

06:16:23.460 --> 06:16:27.460
It's my time, I need to face it

06:16:27.460 --> 06:16:29.460
That's it for you

06:16:29.460 --> 06:16:31.460
You don't need to love me again

06:16:31.460 --> 06:16:33.460
To see I'm going to do that

06:16:33.460 --> 06:16:35.460
That's it for you

06:16:35.460 --> 06:16:37.460
I can't take it over

06:16:37.460 --> 06:16:39.960
I won't stand in line

06:16:45.460 --> 06:16:47.960
Somebody, somebody, somebody, who are you?

06:16:55.460 --> 06:16:57.960
No matter what I'm feeling

06:16:58.460 --> 06:17:00.960
You couldn't see that me inside

06:17:01.460 --> 06:17:03.960
I don't mean that, honey

06:17:03.960 --> 06:17:06.960
But you mustn't need that hype

06:17:06.960 --> 06:17:10.960
I'm living in your reality

06:17:12.960 --> 06:17:15.960
So I have made up my mind

06:17:15.960 --> 06:17:18.960
So it's part of my good thing

06:17:18.960 --> 06:17:21.960
That's it for you

06:17:21.960 --> 06:17:23.960
You don't have to welcome me

06:17:23.960 --> 06:17:25.960
Can't you see I'm going to love you?

06:17:25.960 --> 06:17:27.960
That's it for you

06:17:27.960 --> 06:17:29.960
I can't take you no more

06:17:29.960 --> 06:17:31.960
I don't want you anymore

06:17:31.960 --> 06:17:33.960
This is the best day for you

06:17:33.960 --> 06:17:35.960
You don't have to love me

06:17:35.960 --> 06:17:37.960
Can't you see I'm going to love you

06:17:37.960 --> 06:17:39.960
This is the best day for you

06:17:39.960 --> 06:17:41.960
I can't take it no more

06:17:41.960 --> 06:17:44.960
I don't care what I do

06:18:11.960 --> 06:18:12.960
Who are you?

06:18:12.960 --> 06:18:13.960
Who are you?

06:18:13.960 --> 06:18:14.960
Who are you?

06:18:14.960 --> 06:18:17.960
I'm running out of time, where are you?

06:20:44.960 --> 06:20:56.960
So I can't ignore the fact, no more your yammy when we're mad

06:20:56.960 --> 06:21:03.960
You've made up my mind, now I may find emotion still with me

06:21:03.960 --> 06:21:09.960
But I'm still your step, I feel like I can't stop the pain

06:21:09.960 --> 06:21:14.960
I would never have to leave your name away

06:21:14.960 --> 06:21:16.960
I'm meant to lose you now

06:21:16.960 --> 06:21:18.960
Don't even lie

06:21:18.960 --> 06:21:22.960
I can't forgive if I say

06:21:22.960 --> 06:21:24.960
Now that I've let me down

06:21:24.960 --> 06:21:26.960
I'm not gonna say

06:21:26.960 --> 06:21:28.960
No, I'm just not gonna say

06:21:28.960 --> 06:21:35.960
I can't forgive if I say

06:22:35.960 --> 06:22:46.960
Ah, ah, ah, ah Ah, ah, ah, ah

06:22:46.960 --> 06:22:53.960
Mina hakum koto hai te hajima Mina hakum koto te rejima

06:23:53.960 --> 06:23:55.960
I get a late night urge to ramble

06:23:55.960 --> 06:23:57.960
I got my car all set to ramble

06:23:57.960 --> 06:24:00.960
Don't really know where I'm from so

06:24:01.960 --> 06:24:03.960
I put my foot down on the pedal

06:24:03.960 --> 06:24:05.960
I got the pedal to the metal

06:24:05.960 --> 06:24:09.960
I roll down the highway just like a fireball

06:24:09.960 --> 06:24:13.960
I'm like the stairs on top of a fireball burning out of gold

06:24:13.960 --> 06:24:18.960
Get those potatoes on fire over the sky like I can move
