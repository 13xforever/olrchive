is now on the air. Orange Lounge Radio Live is a live talk program dedicated to all things

00:07.520 --> 00:14.520
Bemani, and then some. Orange Lounge Radio may contain adult content, so you probably

00:14.520 --> 00:21.000
shouldn't let your children listen. If you do let your children listen to Orange Lounge

00:21.000 --> 00:27.000
Radio, they may turn into evil little demons from hell!

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Oh wait, most children already are evil little demons from hell.

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
Now you see that evil will always triumph, because good is dumb.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
Tracked, drunk and stupid is no way to go through life, son.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
He jeopardizes my ability to effectively govern this student body.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
Well, makes you look like an ass is what he does, Ed.

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
Tamburgers! The cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
That was huge. Cool.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
Do you mind if I take my new car for a ride?

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
No, that's right. The only thing you're going to be riding is me.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
Have you seen Mountain Dew?

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Lena?

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to my underground lair.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Please, there are ladies present.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.500
This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.

01:22.500 --> 01:24.000
Dark Sakura.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.500

01:52.680 --> 01:53.960

01:55.960 --> 01:57.960
Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts.

01:57.960 --> 02:01.200
In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm is Jamie Summers.

02:01.200 --> 02:03.800
You know her better as the angsty dark staphora.

02:03.800 --> 02:06.560
Is your mic on over there, honey?

02:06.560 --> 02:07.560
It is.

02:07.560 --> 02:08.560
There you are.

02:08.560 --> 02:09.560
Okay.

02:09.560 --> 02:10.560
I'm powered by meat and asparagus right now.

02:10.560 --> 02:11.560
Meat and potatoes.

02:11.560 --> 02:12.560
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:12.560 --> 02:13.560
Meat and asparagus.

02:13.560 --> 02:14.560
Yeah, meat and asparagus.

02:14.560 --> 02:15.560
Potatoes are evil.

02:15.560 --> 02:21.640
evil! are you on a low carb diet? yes I am. low carb diets are the antichrist you know

02:21.640 --> 02:27.320
why they are the antichrist? okay first of all I'm doing this to be supportive I know

02:27.320 --> 02:31.560
but second of all you know how hard I have worked my ass off so don't yes I know but

02:31.560 --> 02:34.880
they're the antichrist for me because anything that says that I can't have bread and potatoes

02:34.880 --> 02:40.000
is the antichrist. you can still have bread and potatoes just not all the time. but I

02:40.000 --> 02:43.680
I want potatoes all the time.

02:43.680 --> 02:45.240
Don't take my potatoes away.

02:50.800 --> 02:51.480
I couldn't do it.

02:51.480 --> 02:53.640

02:53.640 --> 02:55.200
Did you just beat you up?

02:55.200 --> 02:58.040
I was like, you have to have a single syllable that starts

02:58.040 --> 03:01.520

12:33.700 --> 12:36.340

the best games ever and then Sword of Mana being kind of eh is a little

12:54.700 --> 12:59.420
disappointing but then I also bought Mario vs. Donkey Kong which was you know

12:59.420 --> 13:04.180

13:31.800 --> 13:35.240
how was your day and Jamie you've got the other mic so why don't you have a

13:35.240 --> 13:36.320
mouth full of beef

13:36.320 --> 13:40.440
that's good, beef is good for you

13:40.440 --> 13:44.200
do you like having meat in your mouth? or meat?

13:44.200 --> 13:47.280
it's juicy

13:47.280 --> 13:49.200
sorry I had to slow that down

13:49.200 --> 13:52.640
you should suck out the flavor a little bit before you bite down on it

13:52.640 --> 13:55.880
I'll just take the whole thing

13:55.880 --> 13:59.120
um my week sucked, it was hot

13:59.120 --> 14:01.120
I don't have AC in my car.

14:01.120 --> 14:03.120
Busy as hell at work.

14:03.120 --> 14:05.120
And it's going to get busier.

14:05.120 --> 14:09.120
I finally got the stupid financial aid notice from ARC,

14:09.120 --> 14:11.120
and you know what I have to say?

14:11.120 --> 14:13.120
I have to say that I'm actually very surprised.

14:13.120 --> 14:15.120
I was awarded my federal loans,

14:15.120 --> 14:17.120
which means I won't have any interest on them.

14:17.120 --> 14:19.120
So that makes me happy.

14:19.120 --> 14:20.120
Good deal.

14:20.120 --> 14:21.120
I'm getting, I don't want to say anything.

14:21.120 --> 14:24.120
I'm getting, because I'm a sophomore, I'll get $3,500.

14:24.120 --> 14:27.120
And I don't mind saying so because it's like damn near what everybody gets

14:27.120 --> 14:29.660
if you're a sophomore, so it doesn't matter.

14:29.660 --> 14:32.860
That means I get my laptop in two weeks.

14:32.860 --> 14:36.620
In two weeks, I will be sitting here with a shiny Fujitsu on my lap.

14:36.620 --> 14:37.860
I want a laptop.

14:37.860 --> 14:41.880
Especially after that trip, I need a laptop. They're expensive, I can't afford them.

14:41.880 --> 14:44.780
Go to school.

14:44.780 --> 14:46.720
I need to buy a used one.

14:46.720 --> 14:49.800
I only want one that will let me on the internet. I don't need any, like,

14:49.800 --> 14:54.560
I know I'm actually thinking about getting a Mac laptop. Isn't that scary?

14:54.560 --> 14:58.880
could give me bad looks stop it all you

14:58.880 --> 15:02.080
yeah start with the xbox tonight

15:02.080 --> 15:03.840
let me tell you today

15:03.840 --> 15:08.000
what kind of memory coming out of your week i was your day

15:08.000 --> 15:12.240
and i ended up going to see on friday and could not let my friends of moving

15:12.240 --> 15:13.800
back to utah

15:13.800 --> 15:17.180
uh... we ended up going to see uh... the village that night

15:17.180 --> 15:24.180
and i don't care anybody says that maybe was awesome

15:24.180 --> 15:25.940
I

15:25.940 --> 15:32.640
Like the whole premise behind it. I love the setting. I like how everybody talks in that movie

15:33.380 --> 15:37.020
Everybody just talks like I just like it. I liked it

15:37.020 --> 15:43.580
I'm not gonna give away anything because of course it's one of those, you know twisty movies, but I'm not gonna

15:44.140 --> 15:47.340
Say anything about it. I just really like I loved the whole color theme

15:47.340 --> 15:50.960
I like this the way this guy directs and the movies are slow

15:50.960 --> 15:55.640
But all the pacing makes sense at the end of the movie, so I thought it was really well

15:55.640 --> 15:56.640
done.

15:56.640 --> 15:58.760
Two snaps up from Jamie?

15:58.760 --> 16:02.400
It gets the artsy award from me.

16:02.400 --> 16:05.920
And what did I do yesterday?

16:05.920 --> 16:14.880
Yesterday I hung out with Iguana Girl all day, and we, over the cat, her cat passed

16:14.880 --> 16:15.880
away.

16:15.880 --> 16:19.840
Yeah, I'm sad, but I hung out all day.

16:19.840 --> 16:23.480
We went to this place called Bradshaw's for lunch.

16:23.480 --> 16:24.480
Sort of like Brookfield's.

16:24.480 --> 16:25.480
Oh!

16:25.480 --> 16:26.480
I think it's like the same place.

16:26.480 --> 16:27.480
But it's not Bradshaw's.

16:27.480 --> 16:28.480
But it's not Bradshaw's.

16:28.480 --> 16:29.480
Interesting.

16:29.480 --> 16:30.480
I've never...

16:30.480 --> 16:31.480
I actually thought of Brookfield's.

16:31.480 --> 16:32.480
They had low-carb cheesecake.

16:32.480 --> 16:33.480
Huh.

16:33.480 --> 16:36.760
And it was actually pretty good texture-wise, and the crust was good.

16:36.760 --> 16:39.280
It had this taste after it, so...

16:39.280 --> 16:40.280
I'm going to say that...

16:40.280 --> 16:41.280
Great taste, less filling?

16:41.280 --> 16:42.280
It had...

16:42.280 --> 16:45.000
It was actually filling without the great taste.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
Oh, I see.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.880
It was okay.

16:48.880 --> 16:52.440
And then I spent the whole rest of the night online.

16:52.440 --> 16:58.560
And then today I got up bright and early, read my errands, got myself my comics today,

16:58.560 --> 17:07.080
read them all, devoured them, bought a Dragon Ash CD, because I love Dragon Ash, and a bumper

17:07.080 --> 17:08.880
sticker is the best one ever.

17:08.880 --> 17:13.560
It says, stop whining and plot revenge.

17:13.560 --> 17:15.120
Is that not me or what?

17:15.120 --> 17:16.520
That's pretty you.

17:16.520 --> 17:20.520
And that's me. My week.

17:20.520 --> 17:21.520
Alrighty.

17:21.520 --> 17:22.520
Sakurama.

17:22.520 --> 17:27.520
Let's go to, uh, let's go over here. Let's talk to our resident papa music whore.

17:27.520 --> 17:29.520
Resident papa music hookah.

17:29.520 --> 17:32.520
What have you done? How was your day? How was your week? We haven't seen you in a while.

17:32.520 --> 17:34.520
Yeah.

17:34.520 --> 17:35.520
Jamie saw a real whore?

17:35.520 --> 17:38.520
Jamie said she saw a real whore. Like, as opposed to a fake one.

17:38.520 --> 17:43.520
Well, you know what? I know a deaf whore, so I win. I know one.

17:43.520 --> 17:45.520
Did you sleep with one, though?

17:45.520 --> 17:51.520
So, I was at a 7-11 and this heroin whore came in. She had band-aids on her inner thigh.

17:55.520 --> 18:00.520
Yeah, she was a whore. She was a real whore. Of course, we were right next to the Regency Triple X Theater.

18:01.520 --> 18:02.520
Well, there you go.

18:03.520 --> 18:04.520
There's a Triple X Theater around here.

18:05.520 --> 18:06.520
How long have you lived in Sacramento?

18:07.520 --> 18:13.520
The Triple X Theater was right across from where I used to work, and the guys in the collections department would leave during their lunch break and go over there and watch porn.

18:13.520 --> 18:17.520
Wait a minute, Logie. How many years have you lived in Sacramento?

18:17.520 --> 18:19.520
Uh, a lot.

18:19.520 --> 18:25.520
And you just now learned that there is a place over on Watt that shows Triple X films all day, all night?

18:25.520 --> 18:27.520
No, I didn't know that.

18:27.520 --> 18:31.520
You know what's funny? When the whole April Fool's thing was going on DDR Freak,

18:31.520 --> 18:35.520
and we had the thread there listing our address and contact information.

18:35.520 --> 18:36.520
Right.

18:36.520 --> 18:39.520
My address on there was the address for the Regency Triple X Theater.

18:39.520 --> 18:42.520
You know there's some news about DDR Freak forums today.

18:42.520 --> 18:48.700
Are there yeah, you guys made us something awful dot-coms make fun of lists today or whatever they call it

18:49.420 --> 18:51.420
Okay, it's not my page

18:51.420 --> 18:55.140
Yeah, there were no posts from you in there. So you're okay. Okay me

18:56.340 --> 18:57.860
Okay, sorry

18:57.860 --> 19:03.100
Sorry Garrett. Well, that's all right. Um, well last week was kind of slow

19:03.740 --> 19:08.820
But I made the best of it. My parents were out on vacation and I only got 24 hours at work

19:08.820 --> 19:10.820
so I had four days off and

19:10.820 --> 19:16.100
And only managed to go crazy on two days, and the rest I filled with stuff.

19:16.100 --> 19:19.780
And I had a pretty good time on most of the days.

19:19.780 --> 19:24.380
I met someone new that I'm interested in, and then I found out the bad news

19:24.380 --> 19:27.420
that I was hoping to find out sooner than later.

19:27.420 --> 19:30.900
And hopefully it won't totally fuck everything up, but we'll see.

19:30.900 --> 19:35.500
I just have to stop being obsessive and something.

19:35.500 --> 19:39.580
And then I had my party on Friday, and that was really fun.

19:39.580 --> 19:43.220
And I got really, really, really wasted.

19:43.220 --> 19:46.760
I have never been drunk, really, before,

19:46.760 --> 19:48.300
now that I was that drunk.

19:48.300 --> 19:49.900
And I go, wow, OK, this is drunk.

19:49.900 --> 19:53.740
Which Orange Lounge regulars showed up to the party?

19:53.740 --> 19:59.940
There was Brad, Irene, Matt, and Anita,

19:59.940 --> 20:02.100
and then Janae and James, the guy I met.

20:02.100 --> 20:03.060
Oh, OK.

20:03.060 --> 20:04.380
Yeah.

20:04.380 --> 20:05.180
And that was it.

20:05.180 --> 20:05.900
We had fun.

20:05.900 --> 20:08.840
And people that didn't, I don't think Brad and Irene took off

20:08.840 --> 20:15.480
like, all them pretty much left around like 3.30 or so in the morning, so that was late

20:15.480 --> 20:21.220
for one of my parties, usually everyone going like, well I need to go home now, la la la.

20:21.220 --> 20:27.160
So that was kind of nice to have people. But yeah, I know I was so drunk that, you know,

20:27.160 --> 20:31.420
keep in mind, chatters, I'm kind of new to alcohol, so I don't know all these things.

20:31.420 --> 20:36.340
I am naive. Most of our chatters can't even buy alcohol, so... Doesn't mean they can't

20:36.340 --> 20:42.820
get it who says anything not buying not that we would condone that but of course not but

20:42.820 --> 20:49.300
yeah no my drive my my fingers my fingers were about 25% numb and at that time i decided

20:49.300 --> 20:54.860
we needed to play drunk 2dx and pop music and i'm i still managed to beat murmur twins

20:54.860 --> 21:00.780
drunk and i think i'd be i think i got as high as like a 31 on pop music but then i

21:00.780 --> 21:06.580
I tried a 39 right after that and I just stopped, so I don't know, I probably didn't hire.

21:06.580 --> 21:11.540
It reminds me of the time I played DDR in Vegas, and I was drunk, really really drunk,

21:11.540 --> 21:14.340
and I got like a huge crowd around me while I was playing though, it was cool.

21:14.340 --> 21:18.900
Cool, and then, now I am, like as of yesterday, I am officially on vacation for this whole

21:18.900 --> 21:21.020
week and I'm still trying to remember that I'm on vacation.

21:21.020 --> 21:23.980
Wait a minute, weren't you just on vacation like two months ago?

21:23.980 --> 21:25.320
Yeah.

21:25.320 --> 21:26.840
You're always on vacation.

21:26.840 --> 21:30.100
I only get two weeks a year.

21:30.100 --> 21:36.800
I'm I just decided to take it now because okay yeah well I mean you know

21:36.800 --> 21:43.520
my vacation we usually don't get to pick our vacation until shit I didn't get to

21:43.520 --> 21:47.360
pick mine until like after March I don't think and then we have to use it before

21:47.360 --> 21:53.000
November there's it's weird the way it works all right but yeah I took it I

21:53.000 --> 21:58.320
took it now I'm on vacation and I hope I find something good to do this week and

21:58.320 --> 22:04.240
Oh yeah, and then I got all those wonderful CDs and I spent way too much money on my newfound

22:04.240 --> 22:08.800
collections that I got in the mail all week, and then yesterday my sister was a bitch when

22:08.800 --> 22:12.920
my CDs came, because I had to go take Janae to work, and then I come back and I see the

22:12.920 --> 22:18.360
mailman on one part of our street, but his car is pointing in the direction like he would

22:18.360 --> 22:22.040
have had to pass mine, and I'm all, oh, I wonder, because I haven't checked my tracking

22:22.040 --> 22:23.040
number.

22:23.040 --> 22:27.800
I go home, check my tracking number, it says, your item arrived in Sacramento at 5.30 am

22:27.800 --> 22:31.640
today. I'm like, wait a minute, that means he would have come to my house already if

22:31.640 --> 22:35.520
this car's pointing that direction. So I'm all, hey Shannon, did the mailman come? She's

22:35.520 --> 22:41.000
all, yeah, but I didn't have any clothes on, so I didn't go get it. And she's upstairs

22:41.000 --> 22:46.440
laying in my parents' room, naked in all of my comforters and blankets that I'd left in

22:46.440 --> 22:49.360
there from when I was sleeping in there in the week, because she was gone camping with

22:49.360 --> 22:55.520
my parents. I'm all, you bitch. And then so I go running outside and I'm going to go hunt

22:55.520 --> 22:58.600
for the mailman on my neighborhood, because I hate waiting for it another day or going

22:58.600 --> 23:03.400
to the post office. And then I get in my car, and then all of a sudden he's on the other

23:03.400 --> 23:07.880
side of my street. So I get back out of my car, I run across the street, and then I see

23:07.880 --> 23:08.880
him...

23:08.880 --> 23:09.880
Chasing the mailman.

23:09.880 --> 23:11.480
Chasing the mailman for some CDs.

23:11.480 --> 23:19.480
Yeah, I see him like at least three or four times a month. And it's always him. And then

23:19.480 --> 23:23.520
he just... I'm listening up to him, and he's looking at me like, why is he coming towards

23:23.520 --> 23:28.520
me and you know like there's any other reason he knows who the fuck I am and then I'm all

23:28.520 --> 23:34.900
hey you know my sister said you know I haven't come yet I'm all is uh oh no I have okay yeah

23:34.900 --> 23:42.280
and then he gives me my thing so yeah I got yeah I got stuff all right right on yeah I

23:42.280 --> 23:46.900
think I'm sorry anything else for your week of your day um well no I just wanted to say

23:46.900 --> 23:55.220
I don't remember what I was going to say. The Jafro Sax album, the Jafro Sax remix album

23:55.220 --> 24:01.840
I got was fucking horrible. I bought his first album randomly because I saw it on Konami

24:01.840 --> 24:05.080
style. I'm like, I don't know what Bomani Artiset is. I can't figure it out. I couldn't

24:05.080 --> 24:07.800
figure it out. And I'm like, why are they promoting him? Oh, well, I'll just buy it.

24:07.800 --> 24:12.180
And it ended up being a fabulous album. But he just released a remix album. And it was

24:12.180 --> 24:16.260
so bad that I was trying to just listen to it while I was kind of napping, but I wasn't

24:16.260 --> 24:19.700
really sleepy, I was just laying on my bed. I listened to about half the album while I

24:19.700 --> 24:23.620
was on my bed, and then I went to my computer, turned it off, and continued to go back to

24:23.620 --> 24:28.940
bed. Did you ever figure out what his connection to Bamani was? No, I still haven't. Sana did

24:28.940 --> 24:35.940
one song with him. On this remix album, was it Hiroshi Watanabe, did a remix, and that

24:36.700 --> 24:42.740
was a Bamani artist, for like 5K a long time ago. I have no idea who he is still. But yeah,

24:42.740 --> 24:47.740
his music's awesome, except no one can remix it good. I guess that's enough from me.

24:47.740 --> 24:53.740
Alrighty. Bug, anything you want to share? Your week and your day?

24:53.740 --> 24:58.740
My day has been trying to get my damn computer to boot again. My motherboard died about a

24:58.740 --> 25:03.980
month ago, and somebody gave me a spare motherboard and I had to go buy new RAM, since my old RAM

25:03.980 --> 25:07.140
was not compatible with this new fangled technology.

25:07.140 --> 25:10.740
Dope. Yeah, it's all DDR RAM too, so everyone...

25:10.740 --> 25:16.480
So, that was my day, my week, putting stuff in the warehouse, taking stuff out of the

25:16.480 --> 25:17.480
warehouse, putting it on trucks.

25:17.480 --> 25:18.480
That's...

25:18.480 --> 25:19.480
Fun job.

25:19.480 --> 25:20.480
Yeah.

25:20.480 --> 25:22.200
Hey, they paid me to do it, so I got to.

25:22.200 --> 25:23.200
There you go.

25:23.200 --> 25:24.200
All right.

25:24.200 --> 25:25.200
That's it?

25:25.200 --> 25:27.640
I just need an ethernet drop and I'll be happy.

25:27.640 --> 25:28.640
All right.

25:28.640 --> 25:30.400
Oh, do you need to plug into our network?

25:30.400 --> 25:31.400
At some point.

25:31.400 --> 25:32.400
All right.

25:32.400 --> 25:33.640
We'll get you into the Orange Launch Network here.

25:33.640 --> 25:34.640
Yeah, it's over there.

25:34.640 --> 25:35.640
I'm over here.

25:35.640 --> 25:36.640
All right.

25:36.640 --> 25:37.640
Loki!

25:37.640 --> 25:38.640
I'm a lazy bastard.

25:38.640 --> 25:39.640
How was your day?

25:39.640 --> 25:40.640
How was your week?

25:40.640 --> 26:09.640
um, well, ah, let's see, this week I didn't do much, I played a lot of games on my main cabinet, because I have to get the money's worth out of it. So, by the way, I figure it, I will have to play until I die on this cabinet to get the money's worth. Um, anyways, so, I went down, um, what was it, yesterday, we were looking for stuff to do, so we went down to Golf Land to go play miniature golf.

26:09.640 --> 26:15.920
that's when we discovered guess what now they have night was it night swims or

26:15.920 --> 26:20.720
whatever night with it's basically water slides in the dark so they have

26:20.720 --> 26:24.560
that there now so there's a ton of fucking people lion was like zigzagging

26:24.560 --> 26:29.080
just to get into golf I'm off fuck this I'm leaving so but at least I got they'll

26:29.080 --> 26:35.680
see what condition everything was and the fourth mix or extreme to cabinet not

26:35.680 --> 26:42.880
working still, and you know what? Don't care. Um, Drummania seemed to be okay, and Guitar

26:42.880 --> 26:49.080
Freaks was okay, I guess. And then, um, then we decided to go see the village, and the

26:49.080 --> 26:54.240
village was okay. Um, but I already knew what the plot twist was about halfway through the

26:54.240 --> 27:01.320
film anyways, so, whatever. And, um, so that was alright. Um, but, you know what movie's

27:01.320 --> 27:07.720
gonna rock, okay, is his next movie. Okay? It's gonna be the sixth sign of the Unbreakable

27:07.720 --> 27:13.720
Village. Look for that in theaters, 2006. It's gonna rock. It's gonna combine everything

27:13.720 --> 27:18.400
that was awesome about, it's gonna be a village of super-humans that can see dead aliens.

27:18.400 --> 27:31.920
It's gonna rock. You used to be funny. What happened? You left. So anyways, it's funny

27:31.920 --> 27:37.200
that you should mention a crack whore, Jamie, because I did see one earlier today. Whatever,

27:37.200 --> 27:42.460
it's the same shit. I mean, I guess it's okay. Maybe she didn't have a bloody nose and she

27:42.460 --> 27:48.980
she just had less track lines or whatever. But, whatever. It's still, the stupid bitch,

27:48.980 --> 27:52.100
I'll get into it later, I guess, than the FUs. But anyways, some stupid bitch tried

27:52.100 --> 27:57.540
to cut me off and I flipped her off and that was fun. What else? Oh, and then today I went

27:57.540 --> 28:01.140
and saw Harry Kibar go to White Castle and that was awesome. I guess I would have had

28:01.140 --> 28:07.420
them in stone to find it extremely funny, but it was relatively funny. And, oh, yeah,

28:07.420 --> 28:12.140
and then the rest of the week was pretty much just playing porno games on MAME. Pretty much

28:12.140 --> 28:16.140
I have a whole, you know, folder here, category of porno games.

28:16.140 --> 28:19.140
And what is your favorite adult-oriented arcade game that you've come across?

28:19.140 --> 28:24.140
Oh, of course, this was before I even got MAME, Gals Panic. It rocks.

28:24.140 --> 28:26.140
I'm awesome at Gals Panic.

28:26.140 --> 28:33.140
Um, but then I was playing, um, I beat the, uh, stupid, uh, what is it, the poker gals or whatever.

28:33.140 --> 28:40.140
It's stupid. It's kind of disturbing watching them masturbate with, like, a disattached hand and arm.

28:40.140 --> 28:44.140
It's just like they're taking a mannequin hand and shoving up their, you know, pussy. It's kind of weird.

28:44.140 --> 28:49.140
Oh, and that reminds me, there was this, um, movie that they, um, what was it, it's like a...

28:50.140 --> 28:52.140
I think it's like a Dirty Shame is what it's called.

28:52.140 --> 28:54.140
And somebody, the same guy, did Hairspray.

28:54.140 --> 28:57.140
It's with Johnny Knoxville. It's rated NC-17.

28:57.140 --> 28:58.140
Wait, wait, wait.

28:58.140 --> 28:59.140
You mean John Waters?

29:00.140 --> 29:01.140
Uh, maybe.

29:01.140 --> 29:02.140
Yeah.

29:02.140 --> 29:05.140
It's about fucking time John Waters came out with a new movie. It better be good, though.

29:05.140 --> 29:09.340
better be good though, because like his movies, like ever since Serial Mom, like Serial Mom

29:09.340 --> 29:13.960
was the shit, and then like, what was after that, was umm...

29:13.960 --> 29:19.740
no, no no, after that was, was Cecil B. DeMannet was one. I thought there was one in between

29:19.740 --> 29:23.020
though, I might be, I might be losing, but like Cecil B. DeMannet was like, kinda like,

29:23.020 --> 29:29.240
eh, is just eh. Oh, Pecker, I was in between there too, Pecker was kinda eh, and then like,

29:29.240 --> 29:33.280
Cecil B. DeMannet was even more eh, so he needs to, you know, come back up, like Pink

29:33.280 --> 29:37.580
flamingos too man telling you even if Divine's dead I don't care anyways it's

29:37.580 --> 29:40.940
about these a bunch of perverts to go into this one town and then everyone

29:40.940 --> 29:44.140
starts getting perverted and having sex with one another and stuff like that but

29:44.140 --> 29:48.140
there's like one specific scene that I remember where this lady is like doing

29:48.140 --> 29:52.020
like some sort of dance or hokey-pokey type thing and she's staring at this

29:52.020 --> 29:57.640
like one doctor there I guess like these people are getting injured in the head

29:57.640 --> 30:02.300
or something like that they turn all horny same way she ends up setting down

30:02.300 --> 30:07.700
a water bottle and squatting over it and shoving it up her cooch so that was that was interesting

30:07.700 --> 30:13.060
yes I'm looking at a internet internet movie database right now it is a dirty shame is

30:13.060 --> 30:18.460
done by John Waters which means I will have to see it even if I fucking hate Johnny Knoxville

30:18.460 --> 30:24.420
I will have to see this movie I'll watch it with you see that now did you see what it

30:24.420 --> 30:32.140
was it was basically it's when a bunch of head injuries are causing people to become

30:32.140 --> 30:41.660
sex addicts. So, I think that's pretty funny. So, can't wait. I like that. What was it?

30:41.660 --> 30:47.980
Wes Johnson, fat fuck Frank. This is all I care about. Is Mink Stole in it? Because Mink

30:47.980 --> 30:53.060
Stole is the greatest actress of all time. I don't care what you say. And she is in it

30:53.060 --> 30:57.260
as she has been in all of John Waters other movies. Anyway, the video game nerds out there

30:57.260 --> 31:01.060
have no idea what I'm talking about right now, so I'm just gonna let it go. So anyways,

31:01.060 --> 31:07.140
I saw that, that looked pretty sweet. Other than that, not really much happening, just

31:07.140 --> 31:10.940
a little bit of Final Fantasy, not that much at all, and just, you know, working on my

31:10.940 --> 31:22.940
cabinet. That's pretty much it, yeah. Anyways, how about your week in a, or your weeks? Yeah,

31:22.940 --> 31:27.780
I was gone for a couple weeks in Pennsylvania, and to be honest, really not a whole lot of

31:27.780 --> 31:32.420
exciting stuff went down. I did get a chance to have one of my friends visit

31:32.420 --> 31:35.980
me over the weekend because she lives out on the East Coast. She's somebody I

31:35.980 --> 31:40.300
knew from college and we went out to New York City. We kind of drove around some

31:40.300 --> 31:44.340
areas around there. We found ourselves on Long Island eventually and we went to

31:44.340 --> 31:48.980
Fire Island which is this big gay haven out on the East Coast for those that

31:48.980 --> 31:52.820
don't know. But I don't know what possessed us to go there but we were

31:52.820 --> 31:57.100
just like, oh let's go to Fire Island. So we did and it was it was like a giant

31:57.100 --> 32:18.980
The next day we went to the Crayola factories.

32:18.980 --> 32:44.980
That was pretty much it, honestly. I mean, I haven't been playing any video games except for what I was talking about earlier on Gameboy Advance.

32:44.980 --> 32:48.500
There's only so many times I can beat Metroid Zero before I'm like,

32:48.500 --> 32:53.180
Jesus Christ, I need a new game. So, that was it. But then coming home was very interesting

32:53.180 --> 32:55.380
because the house, like coming back into the apartment

32:55.380 --> 32:59.660
at four o'clock in the morning, because bugs picked me up at the airport. After, by the way,

32:59.660 --> 33:03.060
my airplane in Philadelphia sat on the runway for an hour

33:03.060 --> 33:07.620
and so finally it comes back and it sits and we get to Vegas. And I was only supposed to have an

33:07.620 --> 33:10.860
hour layover in Vegas. Well, now I have five minutes to get to my other plane.

33:10.860 --> 33:14.940
So I ran from one end of the Vegas airport to the other end

33:14.940 --> 33:17.940
and it was like being on The Amazing Race, I swear it was

33:17.940 --> 33:22.740
it was interesting. But I just barely made my plane to Sacramento and

33:22.740 --> 33:27.700
all was well. And then Bug picked me up at the airport here in Sacramento and then we

33:27.700 --> 33:28.280
went out

33:28.280 --> 33:31.540
we ended up meeting Evan for

33:31.540 --> 33:34.780
a late night snack somewhere because I realized

33:34.780 --> 33:38.060
yeah I realized at that point that I hadn't eaten in the past

33:38.060 --> 33:43.380
day so I had to eat. So then we went there and ate and then that was it. Then I was like so

33:43.380 --> 33:47.220
dead tired I was like falling asleep at dinner and I was just like I'm tired I

33:47.220 --> 33:50.980
need to go so I came here and then when I open the door and I walk in I'm like

33:50.980 --> 33:56.100
holy fucking shit when did Loki finish his cabinet because our TV is gone and

33:56.100 --> 33:59.180
it's inside the cabinet and then like the whole room has been turned around

33:59.180 --> 34:02.700
90 degrees or at least it feels that way and then like there's just all this

34:02.700 --> 34:07.640
stuff that used to be over here like piled up in piles on the side of the

34:07.640 --> 34:11.260
room but I thought it was cool and then Loki was showing his cabinet to me

34:11.260 --> 34:18.700
yesterday and I was playing miss world nude 96 which is my favorite adult game

34:18.700 --> 34:23.600
because when it turns from the the girl like if you do yeah well I'll have to

34:23.600 --> 34:26.600
play it for you guys later but when you do badly on it like it's like kicks

34:26.600 --> 34:30.080
right you remember the old school game kicks where you draw the lines right and

34:30.080 --> 34:33.880
you yeah and you try to dodge the little thing that's lying around that's a miss

34:33.880 --> 34:38.500
world 96 like but you're cutting out a picture of a naked lady and that's it's

34:38.500 --> 34:40.800
like the game on the mega touch the adult game I don't know if you guys

34:40.800 --> 34:45.320
ever play mega touch there's one like it on there too so they have this but if

34:45.320 --> 34:49.480
you I don't know if you uncover certain bad parts of the picture then your bar

34:49.480 --> 34:53.520
goes down and if you fall into the bad like the picture of the girl turns into

34:53.520 --> 34:57.440
the picture of like the devil and like it starts playing this eurobeat song

34:57.440 --> 35:03.240
that totally doesn't match it goes like everybody move your body I'm gonna play

35:03.240 --> 35:06.640
it for you guys later because I think it's just that cool I'm gonna have to do

35:06.640 --> 35:12.440
that after the break. I'm sorry, yes, Jamie. You want to share something with our listeners?

35:12.440 --> 35:17.560
Get Jamie a mic here. Not that I'm meaning to interrupt, but Time

35:17.560 --> 35:20.760
Magazine is encouraging people to download movies off the internet.

35:20.760 --> 35:24.640
Like what? I'm reading this article about how a lot of

35:24.640 --> 35:27.720
the horror movies from Japan are being remade for the US.

35:27.720 --> 35:32.520
Like the original director for The Ring is doing Ring 2 over here.

35:32.520 --> 35:34.520
The Grudge is a Japanese movie game.

35:34.520 --> 35:36.520
Right, Juon was the name.

35:36.520 --> 35:38.520
But, um, saying that,

35:38.520 --> 35:40.520
it says, why wait for remakes?

35:40.520 --> 35:42.520
All of these movies are available online.

35:42.520 --> 35:48.520
They meant through Amazon.com, or your favorite online retailer, sure, yeah.

35:48.520 --> 35:50.520
Alright, yes, Logie?

35:50.520 --> 35:55.520
I heard that the new, um, Keshan movie is available on,

35:55.520 --> 35:59.520
actually I have it marked on Supernova, a cam of it, though.

35:59.520 --> 36:08.240
still cam that's subtitled in English good enough for me speaking of all this

36:08.240 --> 36:12.720
Japanese culture stuff hitting the u.s. so Loki and I had the pleasure of going

36:12.720 --> 36:17.360
to a small little convention quote-unquote I don't know what you got it

36:17.360 --> 36:20.560
wasn't it quite a convention it was a fair like a fair with an E on it like a

36:20.560 --> 36:25.880
Renaissance fair but it was a anime fair that they had at the mall and the mall

36:25.880 --> 36:31.220
here in Sacramento, which consisted of four vendor booths scattered throughout the mall,

36:31.220 --> 36:35.320
and then in what used to be McDonald's, they had a viewing room where they were showing

36:35.320 --> 36:38.460
crappy anime all day, and I guess they were going to show live action Sailor Moon at some

36:38.460 --> 36:43.600
point. Yeah, Sunrise Mall. Yeah, the McDonald's closed the Sunrise Mall about three years

36:43.600 --> 36:53.440
ago. Not quite three years ago, a couple months ago. All right. But still, it's closed, and

36:53.440 --> 36:56.020
They were showing anime in there now, and the only cool thing they were going to show

36:56.020 --> 36:59.560
was today, but I'm not much of an anime geek, I mean maybe there was some good stuff in

36:59.560 --> 37:02.480
there and I just don't recognize it, but they were going to show live action Sailor Moon

37:02.480 --> 37:03.480
today.

37:03.480 --> 37:04.480
And that would have been cool.

37:04.480 --> 37:08.640
But anyway, like the vendor booths were not too thrilling, but they were like, it was

37:08.640 --> 37:12.300
really cool to go to the mall and see like all the soccer moms and the brats, and then

37:12.300 --> 37:14.240
like all these cosplayers.

37:14.240 --> 37:18.060
Like there were like tons of people cosplaying as all these anime characters.

37:18.060 --> 37:25.160
Not that, not that there were many good cosplayers, but there were, you know, a lot of cosplayers.

37:25.160 --> 37:32.060
No offensive cosplayers out there, but why do the majority, not all of them, but do the

37:32.060 --> 37:37.420
great majority of them, have to be really nasty, ugly, fat chicks? Honestly. I mean,

37:37.420 --> 37:41.460
I saw some really, it's like, oh my god, when did that character put on a hundred pounds?

37:41.460 --> 37:52.060
it's like a blob has sucked her soul. It was really nasty. I only think that stuff is bad

37:52.060 --> 37:58.460
like when they're cosplaying like it's Mai, or Chun-Li, or somebody really, you know,

37:58.460 --> 38:07.420
promiscuous. Then there was like that chick who was next to me, who I thought was a guy,

38:07.420 --> 38:12.180
Okay, she looked like a dude, and she opens her mouth,

38:12.180 --> 38:13.420
yeah, how much for this?

38:13.420 --> 38:18.180
Well, oh my God, ugly, and I started pointing.

38:19.660 --> 38:24.660
Oh, yeah, I was just disappointed

38:26.140 --> 38:29.180
because usually at those kind of, even an anime expo,

38:29.180 --> 38:30.940
it doesn't matter, like I'm not that into anime,

38:30.940 --> 38:32.420
like I have an appreciation for some of it,

38:32.420 --> 38:33.740
like, you know, the big mainstream stuff,

38:33.740 --> 38:36.300
like Miyazaki and stuff, but like,

38:36.300 --> 38:40.120
usually at most anime conventions you have your video game corner, right? Or you have

38:40.120 --> 38:43.880
your video game vendor or something video game related. I was hoping to see that there.

38:43.880 --> 38:47.460
Nope, not a damn thing. The only thing video game related I could find that was interesting

38:47.460 --> 38:52.700
was the Final Fantasy XI wall scroll, but it was just the generic stock art of the same

38:52.700 --> 38:56.740
thing that's on the cover of Final Fantasy XI. It's the same art I've seen over and over

38:56.740 --> 39:00.660
and I have in like a million different places anyway, and I didn't want to spend $15 on

39:00.660 --> 39:08.880
wall scroll that looked like it was just a bad Xerox copy anyway so that was our

39:08.880 --> 39:13.980
experience at the convention quote unquote I think we spent a total of 20

39:13.980 --> 39:19.420
minutes that and then we went to TGI Fridays and spent like two hours there

39:19.420 --> 39:23.300
so it was good I actually went there to meet one of my friends from out of town

39:23.300 --> 39:28.060
so that was my excuse for going but I'm actually surprised you didn't go Jamie

39:28.060 --> 39:32.580
Just to check it out or you heard about it or anything because that was the one they were promoting over at a1 comics

39:32.820 --> 39:38.140
Which oh, I didn't think it was at this one. Do we have the little flyer here? There's oh, I remember the flyer

39:38.140 --> 39:41.400
I'm here. I think my fire away into the air. I

39:42.420 --> 39:44.420
Had other things to do like

39:44.900 --> 39:46.900
laundry

39:47.300 --> 39:49.300
Well Saturday, right

39:50.220 --> 39:56.620
It was Saturday and Sunday and today it's still going on right now doing things. I remember I had to be I was over at

39:56.620 --> 40:15.620
I feel sorry for anybody that was coming from, like, according to this, you know, they've given directions from Reno or South Lake Tahoe. But again, what anime do they ever do in Reno or South Lake Tahoe? Do they ever have festivals like this up there? I highly doubt that.

40:15.620 --> 40:19.580
comic shop you'll see more anime than there was at this place. Classic Gaming Expo was

40:19.580 --> 40:23.620
in Vegas, but... Classic Gaming Expo's in San Jose this year and I really want to go.

40:23.620 --> 40:28.100
Is it this month? It's like next weekend, isn't it? I don't know. I'm gonna check that

40:28.100 --> 40:31.580
out right now. Well crap, if it's next weekend then I'm going to the Ren Faire. I don't have

40:31.580 --> 40:35.860
plans to go to the Bay Area next weekend. Next weekend I'm going to the Ren Faire. Next

40:35.860 --> 40:40.180
Saturday. I'm going to the Bay Area to visit people next weekend. Wait, I have to find

40:40.180 --> 40:45.060
out now when Classic Gaming Expo is because I have to go. Classic Gaming Expo, for those

40:45.060 --> 40:49.240
who don't know is supposed to be like the most tremendously awesome, neat, old school

40:49.240 --> 40:54.540
thing. Oh no, it's at the end of the month. 21st and 22nd. No I'm not, because I don't

40:54.540 --> 41:00.020
leave until September, motherfucker. Well, I think I can skip my introduction to Windows

41:00.020 --> 41:05.140
class that day. Okay, I have no time to go test out of this. This is sort of an F-you,

41:05.140 --> 41:10.020
but not really. Because I'm going to try to make this an easy A to establish a good GPA.

41:10.020 --> 41:13.780
ooh, Jamie, SNK just joined as a sponsor of Classic Gaming Expo.

41:13.780 --> 41:17.900
Ooh! SNK, we're out of business dot com.

41:17.900 --> 41:22.700
We no longer support the Neo Geo, the last game is dead.

41:22.700 --> 41:25.780
And, uh, Konami's gonna have an exhibit.

41:25.780 --> 41:27.820
Yeah, they're gonna do

41:27.820 --> 41:29.200
Castlevania, I hope.

41:29.200 --> 41:35.380
Oh, right on. Oh, I have to go to this. I'm so going to this.

41:35.380 --> 41:39.540
Maybe, maybe we can head to San Jose after my class.

41:39.540 --> 41:40.040
Yeah.

41:40.040 --> 41:41.240
I get out of my class at four.

41:41.240 --> 41:44.740
We'll have to find out, like, what time everything's at, so...

41:44.740 --> 41:47.640
Maybe we could broadcast from Classic Gaming Expo.

41:47.640 --> 41:49.340
Yeah, maybe we should, like, email him or something,

41:49.340 --> 41:51.340
and figure out something we can do to promote stuff,

41:51.340 --> 41:53.540
even though we don't really do a whole lot of classic gaming,

41:53.540 --> 41:56.440
except for, you know, uh...

41:56.440 --> 41:57.440
I cl- I...

41:57.440 --> 41:59.240
You talk about it on your spin-off show.

41:59.240 --> 42:01.440
Which, by the way, there's news about some of our spin-off shows.

42:01.440 --> 42:02.240
Yes.

42:02.240 --> 42:05.240
Because I'm starting school in two weeks.

42:05.240 --> 42:06.840
Um, starting this Tuesday,

42:06.840 --> 42:08.440
Pump of the Volume is moving back to Tuesday,

42:08.440 --> 42:10.440
Okay, so we can use the old promo again.

42:10.440 --> 42:12.440
Right on, okay.

42:12.440 --> 42:19.440
And I'm going to be especially stressed and drained and angsty and full of ire.

42:19.440 --> 42:24.440
So you can hear me just bitch and bitch and bitch about everything and play some really awesome music.

42:24.440 --> 42:28.440
I'm going to kick it off with an 80's marathon this Tuesday.

42:28.440 --> 42:35.440
And quite possibly the weekend after is going to be me just playing random CDs that I happen to have lying around my computer.

42:35.440 --> 42:37.440
Okay, right on.

42:37.440 --> 42:44.280
Which right now consists of Monty Python, Taku, and, uh, um, the DragonEye CD I just

42:44.280 --> 42:45.280
bought.

42:45.280 --> 42:50.480
Okay, you know, somebody in the, um, chatroom just brought up a very good point.

42:50.480 --> 42:55.600
Um, somebody in the chatroom brought up a very good point that as far as us promoting

42:55.600 --> 42:59.740
classic gaming, uh, we talk about BurgerTime, or at least I do, and I promote, I do a lot

42:59.740 --> 43:02.880
of promotion for BurgerTime, which I believe to be the greatest 80s video game.

43:02.880 --> 43:03.880
Tappan.

43:03.880 --> 43:04.880
What?

43:04.880 --> 43:05.880
Tappan.

43:05.880 --> 43:06.880
Tappan?

43:06.880 --> 43:17.760
We have a lot of good classic gaming stuff to talk about on here.

43:17.760 --> 43:20.640
And Tubin.

43:20.640 --> 43:23.060
And Super Sprint.

43:23.060 --> 43:24.060
And uhh.

43:24.060 --> 43:25.060
Alright.

43:25.060 --> 43:28.800
So we're going to look into what we can do about Classic Gaming as well.

43:28.800 --> 43:31.960
Okay I think we're going to take a break and when we come back we actually have Bimani

43:31.960 --> 43:34.080
stuff we want to talk about believe it or not.

43:34.080 --> 43:38.240
And of course the cage match, you have to use the week, all that fun stuff very soon.

43:38.240 --> 43:43.200
In the meantime, we're going to play you guys some new music from Pop and Music 11.

43:43.200 --> 43:46.320
And our resident pop and music chorus here to tell us all about the songs we're going

43:46.320 --> 43:47.760
to hear today.

43:47.760 --> 43:49.760
So what did you pick out for us?

43:49.760 --> 43:55.120
Okay, well, I put on, he said three songs, so I picked songs that were not hosted on

43:55.120 --> 43:56.120
the Mani style.

43:56.120 --> 43:59.600
So they're songs you may not have heard, so that's why I started with this.

43:59.600 --> 44:08.460
The first one is, the genre is Nebuta, but the song is actually called Karasu instead

44:08.460 --> 44:09.460
of Tori.

44:09.460 --> 44:13.880
I actually got really curious when the song was reading the info on the page at the official

44:13.880 --> 44:18.980
site, and it's supposed to mean crows, not birds, generically like that, because it just

44:18.980 --> 44:22.660
has a kanji for bird, and most people would read it as Tori.

44:22.660 --> 44:23.660
So there's that.

44:23.660 --> 44:30.820
I also put on the remix for Yokan Ko, the Desu Rege song from 7, which I actually like

44:30.820 --> 44:32.180
even though it's really minimal.

44:32.180 --> 44:40.260
And then there's another song called, what was that, Tozancha Tachi, and it sounds kind

44:40.260 --> 44:44.980
of like an anime song to me, but it's actually an original song that the guy from the Parkettes

44:44.980 --> 44:45.980
made.

44:45.980 --> 44:46.980
So, yeah.

44:46.980 --> 44:47.980
Alright, cool deal.

44:47.980 --> 44:52.660
So, this is the premiere of some Pop in 11 music here on Orange Lawn's radio, and thank

44:52.660 --> 44:54.340
Thank you very much for bringing this to us.

44:54.340 --> 44:55.340
You're welcome.

44:55.340 --> 44:59.340
Here we go. We're going to start off with Karasu. Enjoy.

45:55.340 --> 46:04.360
queer

46:04.360 --> 46:10.900
queer

46:10.900 --> 46:17.100

49:47.100 --> 49:49.100

You're welcome

49:58.740 --> 49:59.740
Aaaahhhh!!!

50:04.060 --> 50:08.320
After this song, we'll be having a Let Em Move marathon!

50:09.320 --> 50:11.100
Noooooo!

50:11.160 --> 50:15.520
Just kidding! Orange Lounge radio, crap free Vovanni Radio!

50:15.520 --> 50:20.920
That's right, all crap free, except for this show, which you're tuned into here on this lovely Sunday evening.

50:20.920 --> 50:25.420
As promised, I wanted to walk over to the main cabinet and play this game for you guys.

50:25.420 --> 50:32.620
This is called Mr. World 96 Nude, and if you want to see screenshots of this game,

50:32.620 --> 50:39.720
head on over to OrangeLawnsRadio.com, because it's playing live right now on our webcam there,

50:39.720 --> 50:45.420
and even though it doesn't auto-refresh right now, you have to click reload every 30 seconds or so.

50:45.420 --> 50:47.920
We're working on getting that fixed, at least for next week.

50:47.920 --> 50:54.620
So, also, later in this program, we'll be opening up the Skype line for your comments

50:54.620 --> 50:57.620
over at www.orangewonstrator.com.

50:57.620 --> 51:01.720
Look for our recent news article on Skype, and it'll tell you how to set it up.

51:01.720 --> 51:04.820
Also, in our live journal community, there's a recent post there.

51:04.820 --> 51:09.020
So, we're going to try to get the sound, because I wanted to play the evil song for you guys,

51:09.020 --> 51:10.520
but Loki's still working on sound.

51:10.520 --> 51:10.920
Yes.

51:10.920 --> 51:11.720
I'm a host.

51:11.720 --> 51:12.420
Give me my phone.

51:12.420 --> 51:13.420
Yes, Jamie.

51:13.420 --> 51:17.420
I saw... I saw asses.

51:17.420 --> 51:21.420
I see an outline of a penis that looks very lopsided.

51:21.420 --> 51:23.420
I'm sorry, I'm not at home.

51:23.420 --> 51:28.420
There's a really lopsided lump of an outline of a penis on the screen right now.

51:28.420 --> 51:31.420
Let's see if you trace around the penis.

51:31.420 --> 51:35.420
Like, see, watch. If the little character traces around the penis, then you get to see it.

51:35.420 --> 51:38.420
Oh, some of the ROMs are corrupt, so some of the pictures don't work right.

51:38.420 --> 51:40.420
But it's kind of a fucked up game.

51:40.420 --> 51:41.420
I see more asses.

51:41.420 --> 51:44.760
We're going to see if Loki can get it hooked up.

51:44.760 --> 51:46.980
I'm going to start a game here,

51:46.980 --> 51:51.440
and hopefully we can get the sound over, and Jamie will tell you all what's going on here.

51:51.440 --> 51:55.240
Oops. Rob is playing with the dip switches.

51:55.240 --> 51:59.280
Hold on here.

51:59.280 --> 52:04.300
Okay, the little lion thing looks like a really stupid Pac-Man, but not.

52:04.300 --> 52:08.400
How do I insert coins?

52:08.400 --> 52:09.400
Up at the top, Rob.

52:09.400 --> 52:10.400
There we go.

52:10.400 --> 52:11.400
Wait, two-player?

52:11.400 --> 52:12.400
Dang, that sucks.

52:12.400 --> 52:16.400
It's not two-player at the same time, so it kind of sucks.

52:16.400 --> 52:17.400
Alright.

52:17.400 --> 52:19.400
Shit, I quit out.

52:19.400 --> 52:22.400
Damn it, I hit the wrong button.

52:22.400 --> 52:23.400
That was horrible, Rob.

52:23.400 --> 52:25.200
I'm very proud of you.

52:25.200 --> 52:27.600
This is wonderful radio right now.

52:27.600 --> 52:28.600
Any luck on the sound?

52:28.600 --> 52:29.600
I'm working on it.

52:29.600 --> 52:30.600
Loki's working on it.

52:30.600 --> 52:34.440
We could do a different topic and then come back to this, I guess.

52:34.440 --> 52:38.880
I now need to announce that I suck at R-Type.

52:38.880 --> 52:44.840
I used to be okay at R-Type. My fiance is like a god at R-Type.

52:44.840 --> 52:49.840
That's like me and DDR, like I used to be really good at DDR, but I honestly have not played DDR in a month, so it just sucks now.

52:49.840 --> 52:52.360
Here, I'm going to play this for the chat room.

52:52.360 --> 52:53.440
So you can hear how bad I suck.

52:53.440 --> 53:00.440
Got it? So we hear the sound now?

53:00.440 --> 53:07.440
Oh, I'm hearing Jamie's game. Hold on, take the mic away from that for a minute.

53:07.440 --> 53:10.560
This is our type. Can we hear this? Hold on, if I put the coins

53:10.560 --> 53:17.560
in and do it. Can I hear it?

53:17.560 --> 53:33.880
Can I hear it? No, we don't hear it. Okay, does it work if I hold the mic up here?

53:33.880 --> 53:47.160
Okay, we'll hold the mic up there. Here we go. I'm going to try and get to the evil stuff.

53:47.160 --> 53:54.160
I'll trace around the penis first.

53:54.800 --> 54:01.800
Oops, I died.

54:03.480 --> 54:05.560
See, I got a penis. Look.

54:05.560 --> 54:12.560
Okay, now I'm going to try and make it go bad.

54:12.560 --> 54:14.560
I'm trying very hard here to get there.

54:15.560 --> 54:20.560
Go to the techno song! Don't choke up on me on air here!

54:23.560 --> 54:25.560
I died. Again.

54:27.560 --> 54:32.560
You have to do everything at the time you have to get rid of these without getting rid of those.

54:35.560 --> 54:38.560
So don't get rid of... No, don't have to do that.

54:38.560 --> 54:53.200
there we go almost shit I died again damn this game

54:53.200 --> 55:08.280
Yeah, here it goes. Here it goes. Aw, shit, it froze up! Fuck! Fuck your cabinet. Fuck

55:08.280 --> 55:13.400
this. Let me do this shit. I gotta do it the right way. You gotta play this game, cause...

55:13.400 --> 55:23.360
God dammit, what happened to all my controls? What did you guys do here?

55:23.360 --> 55:28.320
Loki is going to try to get that to work. In the meantime, I'm going to tell you guys

55:28.320 --> 55:31.000
about some general gaming news that's going on out there.

55:31.000 --> 55:40.240
Alright, I don't know if you guys heard about this, but WarioWare 2 is going to be coming

55:40.240 --> 55:44.520
out soon, which is kind of exciting for those of us who have video game attention deficit

55:44.520 --> 55:51.680
disorder. WarioWare is a great game to have, because you're the only one who'll stare back.

55:51.680 --> 55:56.040
They're going to be coming out with this WarioWare 2, which should be exciting. I know that they're

55:56.040 --> 55:59.280
going to have one on the DS too, and I don't know if this is the DS version, I don't think

55:59.280 --> 56:05.720
it is, but they are going to have that coming out. Also, it's updated on our website, www.orangetownsradio.com.

56:05.720 --> 56:12.560

56:17.520 --> 56:19.260

And they're looking at possibly doing Final Fantasy IV through VI.

56:22.900 --> 56:29.240
Also on the list, Chrono Trigger, Front Mission, Chocobo Dungeon, Romanching Saga, Second Detsetsu.

59:51.520 --> 59:53.680
well i got some of our latest news in the local

59:53.680 --> 59:55.320
a lot of it is the money

59:55.320 --> 59:59.040
who lost they get the money seniors i would you know i was in vegas for five

59:59.040 --> 01:00:00.340
minutes this week

01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:03.000
uh... yeah mccarran airport huh

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.720
iran all the way

01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:08.420
from terminal a wanted to relate all the way to the other end of terminal b in

01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:11.280
five minutes before you have to fight for a run

01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:13.840
i'm i'm i'm impressed myself

01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:16.660
all right so what's up in the las vegas mamani scene

01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:17.380
at the last

01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:18.420
there's been

01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:20.900
the orleans hotel and casino it's got

01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:22.980
it's a dancer second move

01:00:22.980 --> 01:00:24.260
will occur

01:00:24.260 --> 01:00:25.000
bergman

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.880
from some clothes

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:28.180
when you're in

01:00:28.180 --> 01:00:31.140
no no but it's not a good look at all

01:00:31.140 --> 01:00:32.980
it's a new orleans hotel casino

01:00:32.980 --> 01:00:35.600
and i think it's because you know they have little bits of america all over

01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:36.580
vegas

01:00:36.580 --> 01:00:38.140
and

01:00:38.140 --> 01:00:40.220
that's far away from the stress though

01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:42.660
so a lot of people don't know their planet

01:00:42.660 --> 01:00:47.780
Well, you know, yesterday I went there.

01:00:47.780 --> 01:00:51.900
I went there yesterday just to, you know, celebrate my twenty-five years.

01:00:51.900 --> 01:00:56.460
Oh, happy birthday, by the way, from Orange Launch Radio.

01:00:56.460 --> 01:01:01.660
I played it for the first time, and it was really hard, because, you know, it only has one judgment.

01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:07.280
You know, which is cool. I like the DDR, it's like perfect, great, good, and uh...

01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:10.320
easy to dance the second move is only a one

01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:13.780
which is complicated

01:01:13.780 --> 01:01:17.380
interesting what's new about easy to dance the second move is they have

01:01:17.380 --> 01:01:18.780
freezes

01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:21.040
like freeze sensor and then uh... freeze pad

01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:25.160
the koreans love those freeze things i've seen it like in every knock off of

01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:28.760
another bumani game they have in korea they have a freeze something like an

01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:31.220
easy to dj

01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:33.260
but easy to dj rocks it really does

01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:34.480
ah i see

01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:36.280
yeah and uh...

01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:40.680
Circus Circus is not much fun to play, according to the Monty locals here.

01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:44.520
Circus Circus is my favorite hotel to stay at though, because it's so fucking cheap.

01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:45.720
Yeah.

01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:48.520
I stayed there, you know, two...

01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:50.000
two Christmases ago.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.160
Why would you...

01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:54.520
Oh, I was going to say, why would you stay in a hotel there when you lived there, but it was...

01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:55.640
No, before I moved here.

01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:58.400
I know, I would stay in a hotel.

01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:00.560
Oh, by the way, Loki.

01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:01.680
Yeah, Loki.

01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:03.320
Yeah. Oh, by the way, Loki.

01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:06.760
I suggest you should watch Suicide Club.

01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:09.640
What now? Suicide Club. I've seen it!

01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:12.600
I haven't. You've seen it already? Yeah, I haven't seen it.

01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:13.840
Hahaha, yeah right.

01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:16.240
They're doing Blockbuster shelves right now.

01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:20.320
You know, it's a Japanese movie about 54 school girls

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:22.600
committing suicide

01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:23.960
in a subway station.

01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:26.500
Yeah, that's not what the movie is about though.

01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:30.720
Well, yeah, it's a mystery of suicide. It's about J-Pop and the evils of it.

01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:34.560
It's about the evils of...

01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:38.160
Actually, there's a really awesome movie. If anyone's seen Ichi the Killer, they're

01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:38.960
making Ichi the...

01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:40.720
Oh, I've seen that! I've seen Ichi the Killer, actually.

01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:44.960
They're making an anime version of Ichi the Killer that's gonna be a prequel to it, I believe.

01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:52.960
Yeah, I've seen the live version. I haven't read the manga or watched the actual anime OVA of it.

01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:56.240
There's also another movie called, I think, Three Monsters that's gonna be coming out.

01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:59.600
It's basically, I don't really know what it is, but they have a scene where they cut off

01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:03.480
some chick's fingers while she's playing the piano or something like that.

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:04.480
Lovely.

01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:05.480
Yeah.

01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:08.800
Alright, well we're gonna go ahead and let you go, but thank you for calling in and letting

01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:10.520
us know what's going on in your neck of the woods.

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:12.840
Alright, have a good one.

01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:15.760
Be careful, watch that, each of the killer in moderation there.

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:16.760
Be careful there.

01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:17.760
Alright.

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:24.080
Alright, Skypline's opened up, we'll take another call if somebody wants to call in.

01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:29.080
Pick up the phone!

01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:34.080
I hate it because I have all these...

01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:39.080
I know I'm going to mess up the pronunciation.

01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:44.080
I have no idea how to play it and I have all these porno games of it.

01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:49.080
He has to match the tiles.

01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:50.080
Yeah.

01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:53.880
No, that's, but the mahjong is also like, it's almost like a card game.

01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:55.880
Like the, the solitaire one is like that.

01:03:55.880 --> 01:03:58.880
The basic thing is that you have to match the tiles a certain way.

01:03:58.880 --> 01:03:59.880
Yeah.

01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:03.160
And clear out the, um, the, uh, panels.

01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:04.680
That mahjong is kinda hard though.

01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:05.880
Yeah, it is.

01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:10.480
If you, if you want, Dan's got seven DVDs of games.

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:12.440
If you want to go through them, I'll try to grab them for you.

01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:13.440
Oh yeah, I saw that website.

01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:16.440
I mean, he's already, no, he got them from somebody else.

01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:25.440
There's a 9 gig, uh, that, that you can get. Ah! There's a mic in my face. Well, don't talk in this house without a microphone during the show.

01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:34.440
Well, anyways, I was gonna say, I had a, there was a 9 gigs, um, zip that I was trying to download. That was before we fixed our cable problem.

01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:40.440
And, um, so it wasn't downloading quite. It was telling me I had, like, you know, 4,000 hours left, and I was like, fuck this.

01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:43.440
You also need to get this Sailor Moon Final Fight game.

01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:46.440
Sailor Moon Final Fight. Let's see if we can find that.

01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:49.440
It's kind of fun. It's cheese ball.

01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:55.440
I also have a personal request because I noticed it wasn't on the machine, but you need to find me Ninja Gaiden, the arcade game.

01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:57.440
Yeah, I need Ninja Gaiden.

01:04:57.440 --> 01:04:59.440
You need Ninja Gaiden on there.

01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:01.440
I think that's it.

01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:03.440
Alright, anyway.

01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:06.440
Okay, we're not getting any calls over on Skyblind, so I'm going to shut it off.

01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:07.440
Yeah, screw you guys.

01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:09.440
Yeah, screw you guys. We're going to shut it off for a little bit.

01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:10.440
We'll come back to it later though.

01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:13.960
because i want about the money is i don't think you guys got to this last

01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:15.460
week talk about extreme right

01:05:15.460 --> 01:05:18.880
to ever talk about the money on the show guys talk about last week i have a

01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:20.120
little bit of all yet

01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:22.480
hip hip all about it all didn't we

01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:25.800
because i thought that you know i swear the guy that did him a more one of his

01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:28.680
biggest promoters is from sacramento because i've seen the car like three

01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:31.320
times now with the pin main license plate

01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:34.920
and don't get that it was the guy who runs this one really big down the site

01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:37.800
does live in a car michael near me and and

01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:40.020
Oh, maybe that's it then.

01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:43.340
Yeah, but we haven't talked to him or anything.

01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:49.140
Alright, so DDRXtreme, DDRSpot.com, we borrowed an article from them

01:05:49.140 --> 01:05:54.660
talking about the full song list was released, well not the full song list, but the

01:05:54.660 --> 01:05:57.220
pre-unlocked song list was announced.

01:05:57.220 --> 01:06:01.200
And a very wide mix of stuff, so I'm going to run through this list real fast.

01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:05.200
Konami Originals you're going to see in DDRXtreme, Firefly by B4U,

01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:06.520
uh... johnny johnna

01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:07.600
jet world

01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:11.640
uh... love love sugar mobile mobile got paranoid eternal pink rose

01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:15.360
do me i was kind of a surprise to see that one wouldn't win that

01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:18.480
you know you say that they've been there's the sensors who may not

01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:23.040
go for that's karima ten o'clock uh... notices and that's extreme

01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:24.040
for p s two

01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:26.120
uh... theme from enter the dragon

01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:27.240
that make me happy

01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:28.740
uh... stupid barber

01:06:28.740 --> 01:06:31.960
that makes me happy to uh... dot five nine or tango ku whatever you want to

01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:32.720
call it

01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:34.400
uh... bad routine

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:44.480
Dropout, Ecstasy, I Feel, I'm For Real, Peace Out, So In Love, Sugaru, Wild Rush, and Your

01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:49.240
Rain, The Rage Mix, Kiryamoka, which some of those we've announced on the show previously.

01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:51.360
And then we get into the licensed songs.

01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:55.240
Some of these aren't a surprise because actually an article that Loki had posted a while back

01:06:55.240 --> 01:07:00.280
about going into the disc and looking at the master song list did prove some of these songs

01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:01.560
would end up in DDR.

01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:06.320
I noticed I recognize the first one right away because I was hoping for this diving by four strings

01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:12.760
Well, here's the thing. It's like they made okay the master song list. I mean you work on songs for a long time

01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:15.840
They might not make it into the actual game that time

01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:18.680
They might save them for the next game, but it's just like, you know

01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:23.040
All the songs that they said that would be in there eventually made it in there. So

01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:29.380
Ha tell those people that say what it wasn't in that game nemesis wasn't in TDR max

01:07:29.380 --> 01:07:38.380
They could have an intention to put it in a mix and prepare it for the thing and never

01:07:38.380 --> 01:07:40.300
not put it in the final release.

01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:47.300
change from beta to final.

01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:21.140
in the middle. It's not coming through. Alright, well. Logie's gonna see if he can fix that.

01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:31.300
That's alright, I'll copy it over real fast here. That's alright, it happens. Let's see,

01:08:31.300 --> 01:08:36.580
we're gonna get a copy of it real fast here. Other licensed songs that are gonna be in

01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:41.620
DDR Go West by the Pet Shop Boys, I think it's kind of funny that they have Pet Shop

01:08:41.620 --> 01:08:46.140
Boys in DDR now. That makes me happy. Because there's a lot of Pet Shop Boy covers that

01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:54.340
have been in DDR before. Well there was just New York City Boy. Wasn't... New York City

01:08:54.340 --> 01:08:58.860
boy and uh... was there another there's others okay look you got it here we go

01:08:58.860 --> 01:09:03.860
a clip of diving

01:09:03.860 --> 01:09:10.860
play in the middle somewhere

01:09:10.860 --> 01:09:38.140
p0k3smot42o

01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:43.140
Alright. That's enough, that's enough of a clip. Alright. You guys got that one.

01:09:43.140 --> 01:09:47.140
Uh, The Kids in America by Kim Wilde. Cool!

01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:50.140
That's the one that goes, We're the kids in America. Yep.

01:09:50.140 --> 01:09:54.140
And that's, that one and Go West are going to have the music video.

01:09:54.140 --> 01:09:58.140
That's the song I regularly played on my 80's show.

01:09:58.140 --> 01:10:01.140
Right on, right on. I'll play it, I'll play it Tuesday.

01:10:01.140 --> 01:10:06.140
Alright, right on. And of course, even though it's kind of, I think at this point the song's a little bit overplayed,

01:10:06.140 --> 01:10:09.740
This kind of reminds me of Heaven, when Heaven was announced for Max 2.

01:10:09.740 --> 01:10:13.620
It was kind of one of those songs that needed to be in DDR for a long time, and then it was.

01:10:13.620 --> 01:10:16.780
And this is very much the same for me. Move Your Feet by Junior Senior.

01:10:16.780 --> 01:10:23.780
With the video, so that's going to be very cool.

01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:27.140
It was kind of neat seeing that at E3.

01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:31.700
Music by Darude, which I believe I've got a clip of it somewhere.

01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:42.700
And it's the race to find the clip. So far, Loki is in the lead. He seems to be looking through his list of folders. Doing a search would be easier.

01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:47.700
I had it at one point, but I don't know if I'd do any more. Damn.

01:10:47.700 --> 01:10:49.700
It's like the Iron Chef commentary.

01:10:49.700 --> 01:10:56.700
somewhat. Oh no, I have next to you, I don't have music. Damn. We'll see if we can get

01:10:56.700 --> 01:11:01.940
a copy. Oh, alright, Logie's got it. And Logie wins. Logie wins. Play a clip somewhere

01:11:01.940 --> 01:11:22.700
in the middle here of music. All right, you're blasting people's speakers. All right. Planet

01:11:22.700 --> 01:11:26.820
Rock, Paul Oakenfold versus Africa Bambata. We've played that before, I believe, on this

01:11:26.820 --> 01:11:32.660
show. The Reflex, Duran Duran, which was in Japanese Max 2. That's pretty exciting. You've

01:11:32.660 --> 01:11:39.660
gone too far this time. Simply Being Loved by BT. Don't Clock Me from DDR Solo Mix. I

01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:44.060
believe that's one of our... That makes me happy. That's one of our songs that's in normal

01:11:44.060 --> 01:11:50.180
rotation on Orange Lawn's radio, I think. Yep. Now I think it is. Yes it is. So we are

01:11:50.180 --> 01:12:06.340
We're definitely happy that Don't Clock Me finally made it into a U.S. DDR.

01:12:06.340 --> 01:12:09.380
And High's Off You by For Real.

01:12:09.380 --> 01:12:17.000
And I have no idea why this song was, I know why this song is in USA DDR, but the rest

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.420
Most of us veterans are going to cringe.

01:12:19.420 --> 01:12:23.640
Kick the Can by Bustoff has made its way into DDR Extreme.

01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:27.920
You know that song never pissed me off until there was that little kid at Goffland who

01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:28.920
played Kick the Can.

01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:29.920
You were there.

01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:30.920
I was.

01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:31.920
I was there.

01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:36.920
And then he went to another machine and played some other song repeatedly.

01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:37.920
You'll enjoy this.

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:39.240
It was before the song was out.

01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:45.000
The next song that's going to be in DDR Extreme is an old boy George cover that you like,

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Miracle.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Don't we have that in rotation?

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:54.000
I think so. I'd have to dig for it, though.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:58.000
It's Max 2.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Everybody knows what Miracle sounds like at this point, don't they?

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:06.000
No, we don't have that one.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Miracle was the first one.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:14.000
Max 1, not Max 2.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:36.600
Alright, that's enough. It's nothing compared to the original. Alright, Never Ending Story

01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:42.320
by DJ ACDC, the one of course was in DDR 5th Mix. One of my very favorite DDR songs of

01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:47.400
all time. I have outwet my pants when I found out this was in because you can't do a bad

01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:56.400
cover of this song. You absolutely can't. I've heard.

01:13:56.400 --> 01:14:11.000
I'm very much looking forward to that one.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:12.880
Rob, I did find a bad mix of that.

01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:13.880
Really?

01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:17.800
It was a happy hardcore cover, but it was bad.

01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:19.260
Only You by Captain Jack.

01:14:19.260 --> 01:14:22.760
We knew Captain Jack would definitely have to come back to DDR and this is the song they're

01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:24.360
bringing him back with, Only You.

01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:25.360
That was like...

01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:27.040
the video

01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:31.640
no doubt yes it will have the video. That was like the PA song for a while. That was the PA song for a long

01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:32.680
time

01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:35.400
I remember that was like everybody could PA that on heavy

01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:39.000
uh... of course this is the one that sounds like the old 50's song like it sounds like a song

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
straight out of Grease

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.360
boom boom boom boom boom boom

01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:45.760
this is radio station CJ Boogie

01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:48.720
with a brand new world premiere song from Captain Jack

01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:51.600
only you

01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:56.600
Only you can make me feel so true

01:14:56.600 --> 01:14:58.600
I'll never, never be so blue

01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:00.600
I know that I love you

01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:32.360
do that one for me three now this is interesting because I didn't quite

01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:37.760
understand what this is all about but karaoke revolution has like covers in it

01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:43.200
basically what it is is we have license songs without the licenses that's what

01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:49.280
these are these are the same songs the hell okay these are the same songs as

01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:53.760
we're in like karaoke revolution so basically it's like you know the 80s

01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:58.580
songs but sung by some retard I see so Konami got a little creative there and

01:15:58.580 --> 01:16:04.660
They took their licenses from Karaoke Revolution, and they took the singers that they used on

01:16:04.660 --> 01:16:07.620
these songs, and they made DDR mixes out of them.

01:16:07.620 --> 01:16:08.620
Very interesting.

01:16:08.620 --> 01:16:11.980
What a clever move by Konami, I must say, to get some very popular songs, including

01:16:11.980 --> 01:16:27.920
Believe, by Cher, Bizarre Love Triangle, Ladies Night, Waiting for Tonight, and Like

01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:32.720
a virgin will that make you happy yeah will make me very happy and it's not the

01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:40.920
euro be one no yeah it's not the euro be one so also a whole shitload of news on

01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:46.400
the i-toy modes this is the funny thing about the this is the funny thing about

01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:52.040
DDR extreme is that it's like having DDR and then you've got like this sequel to

01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:56.840
i-toy play in it too there is all these new modes in there it's crazy like of

01:16:56.840 --> 01:17:00.660
Of course you know hands and feet, clean the screen, we talked about that previously.

01:17:00.660 --> 01:17:05.560
Coconut panic has nothing to do with DDR, you just shake these coconut trees, but by

01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:08.940
the way for those who don't know what the iToy is, that's the little camera that films

01:17:08.940 --> 01:17:09.940
you as you're playing.

01:17:09.940 --> 01:17:10.940
The thing that sucks?

01:17:10.940 --> 01:17:11.940
It puts you in the game.

01:17:11.940 --> 01:17:12.940
It's like Nick Arcade.

01:17:12.940 --> 01:17:16.480
It turns your house into Nick Arcade.

01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:20.260
So then you shake both coconut trees and then you catch the coconuts with your hand.

01:17:20.260 --> 01:17:23.640
And the magical ball, which is like playing Breakout with your hand.

01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:24.640
Magical ball?

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:26.640
If it had been magical balls, it would have been funnier.

01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:28.640
That would have been awesome.

01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:30.640
Almost as funny as super monkey ball.

01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:34.640
There's going to be like a party mode that has some stuff including hyper dash,

01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:38.640
which is like that old school Konami game, like track and field.

01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:40.640
It's going to be like that, but with the eye toy.

01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:42.640
So I'm looking forward to seeing what they do with that.

01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:44.640
Or no, no, I'm sorry, not eye toy.

01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:46.640
They're just going to use the left and right arrows on DDR pads.

01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:48.640
It's like bringing back the power pad.

01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:50.640
So that's going to be cool.

01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:53.640
And then basically you can hit the down button and it puts a pitfall in front of the other person

01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:57.040
the other person, they have to hit the up button to jump.

01:17:57.040 --> 01:17:58.960
That's going to be very interesting.

01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:03.560
Feeding Frenzy, which is going to, it shows animals, and then every arrow on the pad is

01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:08.200
like a carrot or a fish, and you have to feed the animal the appropriate food by stepping

01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:09.200
on the arrow.

01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:10.200
Isn't that weird?

01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:11.200
Sounds kind of fun.

01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:14.680
That one's kind of weird.

01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:16.680
Is what?

01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:22.320
And then there will be a challenge mode as well in DDR, which is going to be interesting.

01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:27.020
So there were some videos released by another website and one of them gives you a sneak

01:18:27.020 --> 01:18:53.180
peek at what some of the interface music is going to sound like.

01:18:53.180 --> 01:18:56.780
So you kind of get a preview that they've done new interface music for it too, and it's

01:18:56.780 --> 01:18:57.780
all happy!

01:18:57.780 --> 01:18:59.700
It's fluffy and all happy.

01:18:59.700 --> 01:19:03.020
But it's not as awesome as a stupid barber.

01:19:03.020 --> 01:19:05.580
No, nothing is as awesome as a stupid barber.

01:19:05.580 --> 01:19:06.900
Which I noticed wasn't on that list.

01:19:06.900 --> 01:19:07.900
Or did I?

01:19:07.900 --> 01:19:08.900
Yeah, it was on that list.

01:19:08.900 --> 01:19:09.900
Was it?

01:19:09.900 --> 01:19:10.900
Oh, I must have just missed it completely.

01:19:10.900 --> 01:19:11.900
Because remember I went yay.

01:19:11.900 --> 01:19:15.180
Here's the thing, they should have really had like a porn star giant tits doing, you

01:19:15.180 --> 01:19:18.820
know, the little animation thing there, because they had that one chick jumping up and down

01:19:18.820 --> 01:19:23.060
that was not doing anything for me.

01:19:23.060 --> 01:19:27.020
All right, we opened up the Skype, we opened up the Skype line again. If you have any comments

01:19:27.020 --> 01:19:32.340
on DDR Extreme USA, something you want to share, we'll go ahead and take your call.

01:19:32.340 --> 01:19:36.500
Maybe something we didn't mention that you really wanted to make sure we got out there.

01:19:36.500 --> 01:19:40.100
I know one thing that was pretty humorous was they actually ran an article on Yahoo

01:19:40.100 --> 01:19:44.000
News. Tell us about this, Loki, because you read about this. You actually posted the article,

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:45.780
a link to it on our site, right?

01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:51.780
Okay, this guy is a professional game reviewer, and I honestly don't think he's ever played this game that he reviewed.

01:19:51.780 --> 01:20:03.780
Um, because honestly, he doesn't know shit about DDR at all. He has kept saying DDR Max from the Xbox, and just like crap like that, he didn't know what the fuck he was talking about, and just comparing it with like...

01:20:03.780 --> 01:20:07.780
He pretty much was talking out of his ass throughout the whole interview.

01:20:07.780 --> 01:20:11.780
So the whole interview, the whole review of the damn thing was just completely shit.

01:20:11.780 --> 01:20:15.780
But, you know, at least it had pictures and pretty movies.

01:20:15.780 --> 01:20:20.780
Yeah, that's where that movie I just played for you guys came from. Of course you can't see movies over the radio.

01:20:20.780 --> 01:20:23.780
But, um, I don't know, we're gonna take a haul real fast.

01:20:23.780 --> 01:20:26.780
Hello, Orange Lounge, you are on ze air.

01:20:26.780 --> 01:20:27.780
Hey, Rob, can you hear me?

01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:29.780
Yes, we can.

01:20:29.780 --> 01:20:31.780
Hey, it is Dark Knight up at the East Coast.

01:20:31.780 --> 01:20:32.780
Hey, Dark Knight, how you doing?

01:20:32.780 --> 01:20:38.780
Alright, yeah, what, throw a quick comment on the song list, it's a pretty decent list though.

01:20:38.780 --> 01:20:43.780
Yeah, it's a very, it's surprisingly different than the arcade extreme, which is good though.

01:20:43.780 --> 01:20:44.780
It's a little yellow different.

01:20:44.780 --> 01:20:45.780
Yeah.

01:20:45.780 --> 01:20:49.780
Yeah, but some of these songs I'm probably going to be like feeling miserably.

01:20:49.780 --> 01:20:51.780
That's alright, it takes practice.

01:20:51.780 --> 01:21:01.780
I'm looking forward, as much as I think the itoy is kind of a one trick pony, I'm looking forward to having my trick the day I get extreme and being able to play the itoy modes on there.

01:21:01.780 --> 01:21:03.060
on there. I think it's going to be pretty cute.

01:21:03.060 --> 01:21:06.820
Yeah, but that sub-para-para mode, that's kind of questionable, though.

01:21:06.820 --> 01:21:10.620
Yeah. Well, you know, it's different. It's the closest thing we're ever going to get

01:21:10.620 --> 01:21:13.900
to anything like it in the U.S., so we might as well deal with it.

01:21:13.900 --> 01:21:16.180
That's true. That's true.

01:21:16.180 --> 01:21:20.140
Anything in particular on the list that you are very excited about?

01:21:20.140 --> 01:21:21.140
Wild Rush, mostly.

01:21:21.140 --> 01:21:22.140
Wild Rush?

01:21:22.140 --> 01:21:24.340
I could play that song easily.

01:21:24.340 --> 01:21:26.060
All right. All right.

01:21:26.060 --> 01:21:27.060
Wild Rush is awesome.

01:21:27.060 --> 01:21:30.300
What about the... I know I love Wild Rush, too, but I thought maybe a licensed song,

01:21:30.300 --> 01:21:34.320
like you know you know it's diving I'm so excited about diving because I love

01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:38.360
four strings I love them and so I'm excited the diving's in there so some of

01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:41.820
the summer song kind of crunches crunches never-ending story because in my

01:21:41.820 --> 01:21:46.120
area that song has been played out on our fifth machine every time we had it

01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:50.400
thank God is gone now which song is that again never-ending story Oh never-ending

01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:55.360
story hey don't you knock that song I'm sorry but everybody is been on

01:21:55.360 --> 01:21:59.360
So in my play round I'm like, just give it this one.

01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:05.360
Alright. In our chat room they're saying it's not Para Para mode, it's more like Dance Maniacs mode.

01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:11.360
Whatever, whatever you want to call it. It's the only Bamani hand thing we're going to have in the US, so deal.

01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:16.360
It's like flag down taxi mode is more like what it is. It's not even Dance Maniacs.

01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:20.360
It's, I look like a fucking retard. That's what it is.

01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:24.760
You know what? When I played Clean the Screen, I did look like a fucking retard, but it was fun.

01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:28.560
And you know what's cool about it is that it's more of a workout than...

01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:29.060
Yeah.

01:22:29.060 --> 01:22:30.360
That was the intention, I think.

01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:33.560
Yeah, you know how a lot of people play DDR for the workout aspect of it?

01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:37.360
When you're moving your arms in it, too, that's like three, four times the workout.

01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:39.760
Would you rather look like a goofball or do the Riverdance?

01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:42.960
I would rather look like a goofball and then have a six-pack and have...

01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:43.760
Just don't do it when you're drunk.

01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:46.160
How does moving your arms give you an ab workout, Rob?

01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:48.160
Just shut up.

01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:49.660
Look, just don't do it when you're drunk.

01:22:49.660 --> 01:22:51.260
DON'T RUIN MY FANTASY!

01:22:51.260 --> 01:22:52.480
Bitch!

01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:56.220
You know what I want to see? I want to see pure interactivity, just like Gals Panic,

01:22:56.220 --> 01:23:01.220
where they actually had 1-800 numbers you could call and talk to the women once you beat that level.

01:23:01.220 --> 01:23:04.140
That was fucking awesome. You are being way too random.

01:23:04.140 --> 01:23:07.340
Anyway, anything else you want to say about Extreme Dark Knight?

01:23:07.340 --> 01:23:11.420
No, that's about it, man. I just hope this game will be successful as it always was, man.

01:23:11.420 --> 01:23:13.500
Just keep it going long enough for me.

01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:16.040
I think it's going to be huge. You know what I think, though?

01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:17.500
Is that this is going to get people.

01:23:17.500 --> 01:23:22.160
Between this and Ultramix 2, and I really think Ultramix 2 is going to surprise a lot

01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:23.160
of people.

01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:28.460
I think people who have been bashing the Xbox, and I admit I was in this category, and then

01:23:28.460 --> 01:23:33.060
finally I got swayed and I bought Ultramix and I kind of ate my words on this show that

01:23:33.060 --> 01:23:39.020
it really isn't that bad, but Ultramix 2, mark my words right here and right now, not

01:23:39.020 --> 01:23:43.300
all of you people out there that bash an Xbox, but 80% of you are going to eat your words

01:23:43.300 --> 01:23:44.540
when Ultramix 2 comes out.

01:23:44.540 --> 01:23:50.420
I admit, I had to eat my words at one point. You will too. I think between Ultramix 2 and

01:23:50.420 --> 01:23:55.420
Extreme, people are going to be rioting for a new arcade mix. Because I think it's going

01:23:55.420 --> 01:24:00.620
to show that US knows their shit when it comes to putting these games together. I think there's

01:24:00.620 --> 01:24:04.300
so many like new things in there that people are just going to say, why can't we have a

01:24:04.300 --> 01:24:09.220
new arcade mix? Why, why, why? Give me time. They don't put a fucking iToy thing on the

01:24:09.220 --> 01:24:13.480
the arcade mix, if there was ever one to come out, because that'd be the fucking stupidest

01:24:13.480 --> 01:24:16.900
thing ever. And I could go into why that would be retarded later.

01:24:16.900 --> 01:24:20.540
That would give you plenty of opportunity to make fun of people.

01:24:20.540 --> 01:24:24.460
But still, just the licenses, just the new interfaces, the new stuff, there's enough.

01:24:24.460 --> 01:24:27.500
You could take out the itoy and you would have enough cool stuff for an arcade mix.

01:24:27.500 --> 01:24:31.940
I'd like to go into why that's stupid right now, okay? I played that stupid game, I Can

01:24:31.940 --> 01:24:37.500
Boogie, okay, which is pretty much the arcade version of itoy group. Let me just say this,

01:24:37.500 --> 01:24:42.600
It sucks. It's just about as good as plain itoygroove. It's just as sensitive. It didn't detect shit.

01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:46.200
I completely failed my song, even though I was hitting it just right.

01:24:46.200 --> 01:24:52.700
And they have really stupid music, and they're like Barbie Girl and hot stuff, and like all this, like, gay-ass shit, okay?

01:24:52.700 --> 01:24:54.600
No, thank you.

01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:56.100
Alright, guys. Thanks, man.

01:24:56.100 --> 01:25:01.300
Alright. Yeah, we're just, like, holding you on the line, Dark Knight. We'll let you get back to listening to the show. Thanks for calling in.

01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:01.800
No problem, buddy.

01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:03.000
Alright, take care.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:03.800
That was fun.

01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:07.600
all right uh... well then back up maybe one more person went through

01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:09.560
uh... d r stream

01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:12.140
do you get off the quiet over there i know you don't care as much about the

01:25:12.140 --> 01:25:15.480
archie do it to the expo

01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:20.600
and a party is able to think about all this

01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:23.400
the last summer play do you know i was when you're over at my house and we

01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:26.040
decide to see if my red octane pad

01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:29.040
well broke and i was a lot of it lady are by the way which is about three

01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:32.660
weeks ago was india i had fun with it but you know it's just

01:25:32.660 --> 01:25:37.260
I mean, if they're not going to make anything new in Japan, I shouldn't be that concerned

01:25:37.260 --> 01:25:41.140
about them making anything new here, because I don't really give a crap about licensed

01:25:41.140 --> 01:25:44.780
songs a lot of the time, and more about the original stuff, so...

01:25:44.780 --> 01:25:48.180
But the new modes and the new features don't do it for you?

01:25:48.180 --> 01:25:54.460
Well, okay, like, remember back in the day, that PC game called, like, Kai's Photo Goo?

01:25:54.460 --> 01:25:59.020
No, I have no idea what you're talking about, but okay.

01:25:59.020 --> 01:26:05.860
I've seen screenshots of these new itoy modes for DDR Extreme, what the fuck is this, it

01:26:05.860 --> 01:26:11.120
looks like some goofy piece of crap like that, and it's like, they should just say it's a

01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:17.300
bonus game for Extreme, it's not a part of Extreme, it's Extreme bundled with itoy bullshit.

01:26:17.300 --> 01:26:23.420
But see, I give Konami a little credit for giving us new itoy bullshit or new bullshit

01:26:23.420 --> 01:26:28.780
at all and not just, you know, especially after they took such an ass-kicking for DDR

01:26:28.780 --> 01:26:33.140
USA and like the horrible stuff we got on PlayStation 1, I mean, for them to come and

01:26:33.140 --> 01:26:34.140
do this and-

01:26:34.140 --> 01:26:38.820
It is cool, I'm just kind of, I'm with the Japanese where I don't really care about-

01:26:38.820 --> 01:26:41.700
It's just not your cup of tea.

01:26:41.700 --> 01:26:43.260
It lost its value.

01:26:43.260 --> 01:26:45.300
Wake you up when 2DX comes to you.

01:26:45.300 --> 01:26:50.580
When I want to get some exercise on again, I'll break it out and then I might buy a new,

01:26:50.580 --> 01:26:55.500
like I might buy Extreme USA when that's here if I feel like getting in shape or something.

01:26:55.500 --> 01:26:57.700
That's about it.

01:26:57.700 --> 01:27:02.260
I'm gonna put up a thing in our forums when Ultramix 2 comes out because I want to see

01:27:02.260 --> 01:27:07.140
how many people went out and bought an Xbox because of Ultramix 2.

01:27:07.140 --> 01:27:13.100
I think it's gonna be, and I don't know, I just, there's just too much hype about it

01:27:13.100 --> 01:27:15.300
and I think it's gonna live up to the hype.

01:27:15.300 --> 01:27:16.300
We'll see.

01:27:16.300 --> 01:27:18.300
Alright, moving on.

01:27:18.300 --> 01:27:21.540
We're gonna move on to the other Bahmani news?

01:27:21.540 --> 01:27:23.340
Uh, actually I want to save that.

01:27:23.340 --> 01:27:26.020
I think I kind of want to get into CAGEMATCH now because it's 8 o'clock already.

01:27:26.020 --> 01:27:30.020
We're already halfway through the show, so we gotta get some of our regular bits out of the way here.

01:27:30.020 --> 01:27:30.520
Alright.

01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:31.520
So, yeah, um...

01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:35.020
Are you doing more bad video game trivia that I can suck at?

01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:37.020
What, the Orange Crush stuff?

01:27:37.020 --> 01:27:38.020
No, the...

01:27:38.020 --> 01:27:40.020
No, no, that was the Vanilla Sky thing.

01:27:41.020 --> 01:27:42.020
Oh, okay. But...

01:27:42.020 --> 01:27:42.520
Darn.

01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:43.520
That's alright.

01:27:44.520 --> 01:27:45.520
That was one of my spin-offs, though.

01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:47.020
Shows you how often I come here.

01:27:49.020 --> 01:27:52.020
Can they hear the Tetris over there? Somebody's saying who's playing Tetris, so I wonder...

01:27:52.020 --> 01:27:53.520
Can they hear that over the air, or...?

01:27:53.520 --> 01:27:58.640
I don't know hopefully not we'll see all right yeah we're gonna get into the

01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:06.520
cage match right now oh no my bad I thought they could hear it just a

01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:09.160
reminder you have to be in the chat room if you want to participate in our cage

01:28:09.160 --> 01:28:13.600
match but it is the chatters that pick the winners of this stuff so let's get

01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:20.120
into it last week on the orange launch radio cage match oh the way cage match

01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:24.600
works I should explain this three songs picked by the host it used to be songs

01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:28.760
that would be good for music video games like DDR and 2dx and stuff but it just

01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:33.800
kind of turned into what's a cool song it's basically what it turned into so

01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:41.360
that's okay but we each song picks the host each host picks each song pick the

01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:48.160
host no each host pick the song and then we let you guys vote on them and then

01:28:48.160 --> 01:28:51.480
winner goes into rotation all week long here on orange on three do now I hear

01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:58.040
that while I was gone my song lost and it was taken over by Loki pick and Loki

01:28:58.040 --> 01:29:02.360
what did you put in the cage match last week that it a wink of the ecstasy 14

01:29:02.360 --> 01:29:07.160
hours Club mix the one that I made and played and I was being lazy all right

01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:11.840
and I really like this mix though so we'll see so here it is you only get to

01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:15.600
hear a clip of it because it is last week's winner so we only play a little

01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:19.460
clip of it because we assumed you already heard it last week like a good listener would.

01:29:19.460 --> 01:29:24.740
So here it is, a little clip of Ecstasy, the 14 Hours Club Mix.

01:29:24.740 --> 01:29:25.740
Enjoy, guys.

01:29:55.740 --> 01:29:59.740
The

01:29:59.740 --> 01:30:03.740
The

01:30:03.740 --> 01:30:07.740
The

01:30:07.740 --> 01:30:11.740
The

01:30:11.740 --> 01:30:15.740
The

01:30:15.740 --> 01:30:19.740
The

01:30:19.740 --> 01:30:23.740
The

01:30:23.740 --> 01:30:46.020
Alright, that was a clip of song number one in tonight's cage match, a very sexy remix

01:30:46.020 --> 01:30:53.000
of Ecstasy done by our very own Loki, 14 hours club mix, so yeah, wow, it's going to be tough

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:56.100
to be but uh... jamie and i are certainly gonna try i think i have a

01:30:56.100 --> 01:30:57.440
song that might do it

01:30:57.440 --> 01:31:01.380
i think that but we will give yours a try to jamie but i gotta say looking at

01:31:01.380 --> 01:31:02.360
your pick

01:31:02.360 --> 01:31:03.460
this isn't

01:31:03.460 --> 01:31:06.400
this isn't what i would think you would listen to i'm very surprised by your

01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:07.240
pick

01:31:07.240 --> 01:31:08.820
return it turn on your mike

01:31:08.820 --> 01:31:10.100
internet

01:31:10.100 --> 01:31:12.860
well you know you like those metro mixes

01:31:12.860 --> 01:31:15.480
but the artist is somebody i would never expect

01:31:15.480 --> 01:31:18.600
you to like this is a sexy boy

01:31:18.600 --> 01:31:24.200
you need to regain regal and i think that i think that i think that i think

01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:25.680
and anything that's good

01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:26.680
and your own

01:31:26.680 --> 01:31:27.920
the metric

01:31:27.920 --> 01:31:28.860
because

01:31:28.860 --> 01:31:30.080
it's a metric

01:31:30.080 --> 01:31:32.880
and so this is something that you think would be good indeed you are just

01:31:32.880 --> 01:31:34.460
it's just cool why

01:31:34.460 --> 01:31:37.040
and didn't know

01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:44.040
it would be playable but i mean it

01:31:44.040 --> 01:31:48.240
We'll see what the folks here think.

01:31:48.240 --> 01:31:55.240

If you were a kid with me Why'd you hear it from me?

01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:29.240
Would you say that you'll always be me?

01:33:29.240 --> 01:33:36.240
Would you lie? Would you remember me?

01:33:36.240 --> 01:33:45.240
Am I into me? Have I lost my mind?

01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:53.240

And I will stand by you forever

01:35:43.240 --> 01:35:50.240
You can take my breath away

01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:58.240
You can keep my breath away

01:35:58.240 --> 01:36:05.240
And I can be your hero

01:36:28.240 --> 01:36:31.240
Good voice, Metro Max, it's like a 9 from me.

01:36:31.240 --> 01:36:33.240
Alright, 9 from Jamie.

01:36:33.240 --> 01:36:35.240
Garrett.

01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:41.240
I hear the original version of that song all damn day at work, I don't want to hear it.

01:36:41.240 --> 01:36:43.240
Scale of 1 to 10?

01:36:43.240 --> 01:36:45.240
Bel Air Radio.

01:36:45.240 --> 01:36:47.240
I don't know. No comment.

01:36:47.240 --> 01:36:49.240
Alright, Bug.

01:36:49.240 --> 01:36:53.240
I was playing Cytobike. Cytobike was better.

01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:55.240
Alright, Loki.

01:36:55.240 --> 01:37:04.240
Is eh, the original song is like eh, and this is just like eh within their beats in the background, like it was like a five.

01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:14.240
Um, I, it's definitely, I like it better than the original, I like it with the added beat, um, so it's above average to me, so I give it like a seven, so it's pretty cool.

01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:19.240
Um, but I've heard better Metro mixes, like I like the Daniel Bedingfield ones better, but that's alright.

01:37:19.240 --> 01:37:26.240
Anyway, moving on, I'm going to try this from iTunes tonight, because this is a song I actually bought on iTunes.

01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:28.240
Hopefully it works for you guys.

01:37:28.240 --> 01:37:33.240
Song number three in tonight's cage match is my pick, and I don't know if you guys have heard,

01:37:33.240 --> 01:37:36.240
but Utada Hikaru is going to be coming out with a US album.

01:37:36.240 --> 01:37:38.240
Go to utada.com.

01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:42.240
Yep, and she's going to be under the name Utada, just simply Utada here in the US.

01:37:42.240 --> 01:37:46.240
And the lead single is out now, and it's called Devil Inside.

01:37:46.240 --> 01:37:50.740
And I liked one of the remixes of the songs in the single, so I picked that for tonight's cage match.

01:37:50.740 --> 01:37:56.940
So my pick for tonight's cage match is Utada with Devil Inside, the Richard Vision radio edit.

01:37:56.940 --> 01:37:57.940
Enjoy, you guys.

01:38:26.940 --> 01:38:31.940
If everybody wants something, take a crayon

01:38:40.940 --> 01:38:44.940
If you don't know my plan

01:38:47.940 --> 01:38:51.940
If you don't know my plan

01:39:21.940 --> 01:39:30.940
You don't know the future, baby, baby

01:39:30.940 --> 01:39:38.940
You're actually missing all the action and dreams, baby

01:39:38.940 --> 01:39:56.940
Maybe there's something like it inside, maybe there's something like it inside for me

01:39:57.140 --> 01:39:59.140
There's something like it inside

01:40:00.120 --> 01:40:02.960
There's something like it inside

01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:04.960
Alright, that was song number three in tonight's cage match.

01:41:04.960 --> 01:41:07.960
Utada with Devil Inside.

01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:09.960
That's her first American single.

01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:12.960
Well, unless you count Simple and Clean, but that wasn't really a single.

01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:15.960
Devil Inside, the Richard Vision radio edit.

01:41:15.960 --> 01:41:16.960
Let's go around and see what everybody thought.

01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:17.960
Jamie!

01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:25.960
I really, really dig her voice, but that was such a boring remix that I give it a six.

01:41:25.960 --> 01:41:26.960
Aww.

01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:31.960
Her voice gets a ten, the mix itself would get like a four, so she gets a six.

01:41:31.960 --> 01:41:38.300
Honestly thought the original was so repetitive that it wouldn't have worked in cage match. I agree the remix is kind of but

01:41:39.040 --> 01:41:44.320
Garrett um I never heard the original or the remix and I was kind of I was pretty fond of it

01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:47.280
I like to voice a lot in that too everything I usually hear from her

01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:53.280
Sounds like they want to be like Britney or something so I'm I know it's good to hear something something

01:41:53.280 --> 01:41:58.820
I've sounded slightly more original vocally so I get a seven all right seven from Garrett

01:41:58.820 --> 01:42:01.100
uh... but we give them a mic

01:42:01.100 --> 01:42:03.480
if he's not to be playing something on the main cabinet

01:42:03.480 --> 01:42:04.900
actually i was kind of thing

01:42:04.900 --> 01:42:06.240
okay what do you think

01:42:06.240 --> 01:42:07.700
uh... but in the last one

01:42:07.700 --> 01:42:12.060
i would you give us going to have

01:42:12.060 --> 01:42:13.380
uh... right

01:42:13.380 --> 01:42:15.220
i love you

01:42:15.220 --> 01:42:16.180
uh...

01:42:16.180 --> 01:42:19.740
you know i swear to god i've heard that might be another car i'd just don't

01:42:19.740 --> 01:42:22.060
remember what exactly it was

01:42:22.060 --> 01:42:24.660
so uh... right and

01:42:24.660 --> 01:42:26.460
and i like her

01:42:26.460 --> 01:42:27.940
i like her music

01:42:27.940 --> 01:42:31.580
but that was just like really crappy she should really just

01:42:31.580 --> 01:42:35.260
take everything she does in japan just bring it over here don't try to you know

01:42:35.260 --> 01:42:41.620
make it no more american by taking a shit on it you know

01:42:41.620 --> 01:42:44.700
so yeah i'll give it like a six

01:42:44.700 --> 01:42:50.900
uh... me personally it's very disco to me and disco rocks so i give it an eight

01:42:50.900 --> 01:42:53.860

metro mix

01:43:45.060 --> 01:43:47.740

01:44:56.080 --> 01:44:59.480
wanted to call and that's all just uh...

01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:03.920
uh... but the other thing that i can't get it to work

01:45:03.920 --> 01:45:08.800
i have to make a comment that they can't get it to work

01:45:08.800 --> 01:45:09.800
all right and i

01:45:09.800 --> 01:45:11.000
uh... that's right

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:15.080
uh... so what's tell us about the uh... two d x eleven style news

01:45:15.080 --> 01:45:17.540
guarantees and meaning me

01:45:17.540 --> 01:45:20.760
you know so we're doing i have to say first up are you sure this is legit

01:45:20.760 --> 01:45:23.020
because i was really good at that point where it is

01:45:23.020 --> 01:45:25.120
and shouted very

01:45:25.120 --> 01:45:28.700
they're telling us what part of it you know go well wait a minute you know

01:45:28.700 --> 01:45:31.920
there was it didn't have that kind of air to

01:45:31.920 --> 01:45:36.580
d r extreme to stuff that was going around right but

01:45:36.580 --> 01:45:38.040
yet but yet

01:45:38.040 --> 01:45:39.700
it will anyways um...

01:45:39.700 --> 01:45:42.420
Well, actually, the strangest thing is, um,

01:45:42.420 --> 01:45:45.980
DJP on Damani's style, like, I haven't talked to him in a long time,

01:45:45.980 --> 01:45:47.140
and then we just,

01:45:47.140 --> 01:45:48.660
like, he just messaged me, like,

01:45:48.660 --> 01:45:50.320
like, one morning, he was like, oh, they,

01:45:50.320 --> 01:45:54.020
we just found out, Eleven's style, la la la.

01:45:54.020 --> 01:45:57.360
The only thing that makes it look fake is all the damn speculation that's going on it,

01:45:57.360 --> 01:46:00.300
because there hasn't, there isn't a lot of concrete information.

01:46:00.300 --> 01:46:01.740
There is, um,

01:46:01.740 --> 01:46:03.820
a fax that came out

01:46:03.820 --> 01:46:06.660
that they, um, it's, they said that it's the, it's the,

01:46:06.660 --> 01:46:12.180
They always send these faxes out to arcades, when there's a new style coming out, and test

01:46:12.180 --> 01:46:16.580
locations soon to give arcades information about the next upgrade kit and stuff.

01:46:16.580 --> 01:46:22.060
And that was what was sent to whoever, I forgot the whole chain of people it went through,

01:46:22.060 --> 01:46:27.440
but they said their sources from where it came from are very legit, and I believe everything

01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:35.260
on the fax, but people are already saying that, oh, KorsKay is doing the system music,

01:46:35.260 --> 01:46:39.660
oh there's gonna be an iconoclasm song in it and all this other crap and it's

01:46:39.660 --> 01:46:43.860
not just wishful thinking because when I did the part that got me was that they

01:46:43.860 --> 01:46:46.980
said that Oh No Ken was gonna have a song in it and don't get me wrong I

01:46:46.980 --> 01:46:50.260
think that should happen because he's a very talented that's all the

01:46:50.260 --> 01:46:55.900
speculation that makes me go that's so fanboy ish you know yeah well they said

01:46:55.900 --> 01:47:01.300
like I said you know okay course K doing the system music okay DJ talk is in all

01:47:01.300 --> 01:47:07.260
the system music except, um, Slake did the theme for 8th style. Unless I'm, I'm disregarding

01:47:07.260 --> 01:47:07.260
old stuff.

01:47:07.260 --> 01:47:10.660
But Chorus K is kind of made more and more of a presence in 2DX, 9th, 10th.

01:47:10.660 --> 01:47:14.580
I would say it'd be a bigger surprise, um, I'd say it'd make more sense for a reused

01:47:14.580 --> 01:47:21.340
star to do, um, the system music. Because all of a sudden it went from one song in 4th,

01:47:21.340 --> 01:47:26.740
a remix in 9th, and then three new songs in 10th, and Chorus K still only has two songs

01:47:26.740 --> 01:47:37.380
in existence in 2DX or 3. So I'm like, whatever. But they showed me the facts and stuff. There's

01:47:37.380 --> 01:47:45.380
a link to it on Bamani style too. But I wasn't in a very Japanese-y mood to try and make

01:47:45.380 --> 01:47:49.280
out much of it. But one thing I did notice on there, because a lot of people are saying

01:47:49.280 --> 01:47:55.500
that it's going to be transplant heavy, I think that they may have misread that or I

01:47:55.500 --> 01:48:00.680
I just didn't read it thoroughly enough. There's a part at the bottom where it says, it mentions

01:48:00.680 --> 01:48:06.160
pop music, drum mania and guitar freaks, but it says collaboration in Katakana. So it may

01:48:06.160 --> 01:48:12.680
be more artists from other games are crossing over into this.

01:48:12.680 --> 01:48:17.160
Interesting. Also, speaking of artists, we just got this word in our chat room. Mel B,

01:48:17.160 --> 01:48:21.920
who by passes along some official news from Konami, mentions that Shotee, I don't think

01:48:21.920 --> 01:48:24.560
I don't think he's done anything in 2DX, but DDR, of course, is stupid barber.

01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:29.640
Shotee has parted ways with Konami, so we won't be singing any more songs from him,

01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:30.640
which is too bad.

01:48:30.640 --> 01:48:31.640
Aww, no more Shoichiro Hirata?

01:48:31.640 --> 01:48:32.640
Yeah, because...

01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:33.640
Aww.

01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:34.640
That's sad.

01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:37.080
There was no more Kira Shunsuker...

01:48:37.080 --> 01:48:38.080
I think that was his name.

01:48:38.080 --> 01:48:43.440
In Popin Music 11, once I got my damn CD, I rifled through the booklet, and he's gone

01:48:43.440 --> 01:48:44.440
too.

01:48:44.440 --> 01:48:45.440
Yeah.

01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:46.440
Yeah.

01:48:46.440 --> 01:48:56.440
Yeah, the only thing that I think is really, really weird about that fax is that it's 2Dx11 style red.

01:48:56.440 --> 01:49:00.440
What the hell is that? 2Dx Red.

01:49:00.440 --> 01:49:02.440
Did you see the fax?

01:49:02.440 --> 01:49:05.440
No, you can actually see the actual fax?

01:49:05.440 --> 01:49:10.440
Yeah, you can see the fax. They have pictures of EMAL cards on it too.

01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:15.440
I know there's going to be an upgrade for the EMAL machine or system or something.

01:49:15.440 --> 01:49:20.440
They said there will be over 300 songs included in the arcade, I think.

01:49:20.440 --> 01:49:22.440
But yeah, just go to Bimani style real quick.

01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:24.440
Alright, I'm going, I'm going. Let's see, let's check this out.

01:49:24.440 --> 01:49:26.440
And then it's on the last news.

01:49:26.440 --> 01:49:28.440
Thank God they don't have that god-awful music.

01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:32.440
Actually, I really like that song that used to play on here, but man, after hearing it for like three weeks.

01:49:32.440 --> 01:49:34.440
And then down at the bottom.

01:49:34.440 --> 01:49:35.440
Bottom, bottom.

01:49:35.440 --> 01:49:36.440
Bottom, bottom, bottom.

01:49:36.440 --> 01:49:37.440
Headlines.

01:49:37.440 --> 01:49:38.440
Alright, we're on our way.

01:49:38.440 --> 01:49:42.000
take a look at the facts here. Because I haven't seen this. Remember, I was gone for two weeks.

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:45.480
I was completely out of the loop for like two weeks.

01:49:45.480 --> 01:49:49.400
Oh, there it is. Okay, just click on the first page. And it's a link right there.

01:49:49.400 --> 01:49:53.800
So when I came back home, I was like, oh, interesting.

01:49:53.800 --> 01:50:01.160
Yes.

01:50:01.160 --> 01:50:02.160
Very interesting.

01:50:02.160 --> 01:50:03.160
Let's see, there's going to be more than...

01:50:03.160 --> 01:50:04.960
What? With a little screenshot and everything?

01:50:04.960 --> 01:50:13.640
Yeah, okay, more than 45 new songs, more than 320 songs in the fucking arcade, here's all

01:50:13.640 --> 01:50:20.600
those email cards, blah, blah, blah, see there's the thing right here it says, it's like, I'm

01:50:20.600 --> 01:50:29.440
being lazy, it's like miscellaneous spamani, series, something, music, collaboration, no,

01:50:29.440 --> 01:50:43.240
can't translate it, it's a scan. Collaboration. It doesn't say transplant, it says collaboration.

01:50:43.240 --> 01:50:52.280
It's an English word they're using. Popping music from many guitar freaks. New something,

01:50:52.280 --> 01:50:58.360
something participating entry user something. Garrett's going through and actually reading

01:50:58.360 --> 01:51:01.640
something like what japanese he knows he's reading some of the japanese facts

01:51:01.640 --> 01:51:05.640
is all in japanese but he's reading some of it i can type it out later and do

01:51:05.640 --> 01:51:08.240
of lazy translation on it too but i'm sure

01:51:08.240 --> 01:51:11.180
i think that i don't i don't somebody obviously are all the people who did the

01:51:11.180 --> 01:51:14.840
speculating and said stuff about what was listed in here i have no idea who

01:51:14.840 --> 01:51:16.600
actually did that or if they

01:51:16.600 --> 01:51:19.660
were going off their own guesses are actually translated from the they have a

01:51:19.660 --> 01:51:23.000
lot of japanese users on there that can do that though

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.120
right here

01:51:25.120 --> 01:51:28.120
you know the pictures that they show a really shitty

01:51:28.120 --> 01:51:41.120
But maybe, like, for instance, maybe the background for, like, that one screenshot was FMV from an OnuKen song, because he does do his, you know, BMS files with, you know, full motion video.

01:51:41.120 --> 01:51:45.120
And so they might have recognized that, and that's where the speculation for that comes.

01:51:45.120 --> 01:51:46.120
Oh.

01:51:46.120 --> 01:51:47.120
Just a guess.

01:51:47.120 --> 01:51:48.120
Who knows?

01:51:48.120 --> 01:51:50.120
I couldn't see anything in it.

01:51:50.120 --> 01:51:51.120
All right.

01:51:51.120 --> 01:51:52.120
Well, we'll, uh...

01:51:52.120 --> 01:51:53.120
They have...

01:51:53.120 --> 01:51:54.120
I don't know.

01:51:54.120 --> 01:51:55.120
I mean, it's a scan of a fax.

01:51:55.120 --> 01:51:57.120
I mean, eh, you know?

01:51:57.120 --> 01:52:02.400
I don't know. It's just the facts. Actually, yeah, the scan of the facts, but it's going

01:52:02.400 --> 01:52:05.720
to look the same either way. I want to spat out the machine where it was faxed from.

01:52:05.720 --> 01:52:11.840
Still, it's just that OnoKen thing. It just reeks of fanboy. It's not that I don't want

01:52:11.840 --> 01:52:15.760
to believe it's true, because I think that's awesome, but it's just so... I don't know.

01:52:15.760 --> 01:52:18.200
I think if it is true, that's very cool. The Konami did that.

01:52:18.200 --> 01:52:21.180
The Iconoclasm thing is very fanboy too. Come on.

01:52:21.180 --> 01:52:27.180
I don't see how you would know who's doing the theme music and whatnot yet.

01:52:27.180 --> 01:52:35.180
There were so many people who planted bullshit rumors when 10th Style was coming out on secret songs and stuff. It was not even funny.

01:52:35.180 --> 01:52:40.180
They would even talk about how the Japanese really like to just fuck with us.

01:52:40.180 --> 01:52:48.180
We're being called out in the chat room because it's not really 11th Style because now it's the 2DX Red.

01:52:48.180 --> 01:52:54.180
It's not 11th, it's 2DX Red. But you know, how long were we calling it DDR6 Mix before we found it?

01:52:54.180 --> 01:52:56.180
It still has an 11 in there.

01:52:56.180 --> 01:53:00.180
Yeah, there's a little 11 in there, so it's a reference to it.

01:53:00.180 --> 01:53:03.180
I don't think we're going to be seeing blue or yellow or any other color anytime soon.

01:53:03.180 --> 01:53:07.180
Somebody suggested 2DX Grape for 12th.

01:53:07.180 --> 01:53:09.180
I want a purple 2DX.

01:53:09.180 --> 01:53:10.180
That's what I want.

01:53:10.180 --> 01:53:13.180
I hope they change the interface up and stuff.

01:53:13.180 --> 01:53:15.180
I'm sorry, what, Jamie?

01:53:15.180 --> 01:53:17.180
We can't hear you.

01:53:17.180 --> 01:53:23.580
I was taking a nap. 2DX burning.

01:53:23.580 --> 01:53:24.580
Burning heat.

01:53:24.580 --> 01:53:25.580
Burning.

01:53:25.580 --> 01:53:26.580
Burning.

01:53:26.580 --> 01:53:27.580
Burnination mix.

01:53:27.580 --> 01:53:30.100
Like a 2DX Muru mix or something.

01:53:30.100 --> 01:53:31.100
Alright.

01:53:31.100 --> 01:53:32.100
That'd be cool.

01:53:32.100 --> 01:53:35.460
Anything else you actually had to think of on 2DX?

01:53:35.460 --> 01:53:38.820
When the fax came out they said that the test location was going on that day.

01:53:38.820 --> 01:53:39.820
They were wrong.

01:53:39.820 --> 01:53:43.060
They reconfirmed it and they said that it should actually be going on within this next

01:53:43.060 --> 01:53:46.660
week because when they send these faxes all the test locations have happened within a

01:53:46.660 --> 01:53:49.780
week of them sending it, usually, so that's kind of quick.

01:53:49.780 --> 01:53:54.340
We'll probably, well, it's just a fact, it's just for the test location.

01:53:54.340 --> 01:53:57.560
They do think these things kind of last a moment anyway, so this week, hopefully, we'll

01:53:57.560 --> 01:53:58.560
probably sing.

01:53:58.560 --> 01:54:04.580
Yeah, but it seems like the time between eighth's release and anything on ninth, and the ninth's

01:54:04.580 --> 01:54:09.220
release and anything on tenth, was longer than tenth's release and now this first bit

01:54:09.220 --> 01:54:12.380
of indication that there will be a continuation of the series.

01:54:12.380 --> 01:54:18.420
kind of snuck up after 9th in my opinion. I don't know. Shit, they hella jump on these

01:54:18.420 --> 01:54:23.700
things on the Drummanian Guitar Freak stuff. They just spew those things out. But they

01:54:23.700 --> 01:54:28.380
said that the test location should probably be going on within a week or so. They think

01:54:28.380 --> 01:54:34.300
that the actual arcade will be out in October. And also, I don't know if everyone didn't

01:54:34.300 --> 01:54:37.560
know, 8th Style CS will be released before the year is over.

01:54:37.560 --> 01:54:38.560
over.

01:54:38.560 --> 01:54:39.560
Good.

01:54:39.560 --> 01:54:40.560
Yeah.

01:54:40.560 --> 01:54:41.560
Good news.

01:54:41.560 --> 01:54:42.560
All right.

01:54:42.560 --> 01:54:43.560
Lots of fun stuff in the 2DX front then.

01:54:43.560 --> 01:54:44.560
Good.

01:54:44.560 --> 01:54:45.560
So it's not a dying series.

01:54:45.560 --> 01:54:46.560
No.

01:54:46.560 --> 01:54:47.560
As most people would like you to believe.

01:54:47.560 --> 01:54:48.560
Yay.

01:54:48.560 --> 01:54:49.560
All right.

01:54:49.560 --> 01:54:50.560
We're going to reveal...

01:54:50.560 --> 01:54:51.560
If that's all you got to say on 2DX.

01:54:51.560 --> 01:54:52.560
Yep.

01:54:52.560 --> 01:54:53.560
All right.

01:54:53.560 --> 01:54:56.280
We'll go ahead and open up the Skype line if somebody has a comment they want to say

01:54:56.280 --> 01:55:00.380
on 2DX11, 2DX Red, whatever you want to call it.

01:55:00.380 --> 01:55:02.380
Why 2DX Red?

01:55:02.380 --> 01:55:03.380
Why?

01:55:03.380 --> 01:55:04.380
This is...

01:55:04.380 --> 01:55:05.380
Whatever.

01:55:05.380 --> 01:55:06.380
I guess why Max?

01:55:06.380 --> 01:55:07.380
I mean, why Max?

01:55:07.380 --> 01:55:10.460
Why Pokemon Red? Why Pokemon Blue?

01:55:10.460 --> 01:55:15.260
Why do they have all their bad Engrish titles and their banners and stuff?

01:55:15.260 --> 01:55:19.380
Somebody in our chat room was comparing it to Dance Mania being like Dance Mania Best

01:55:19.380 --> 01:55:22.220
Red and Best Yellow.

01:55:22.220 --> 01:55:26.620
Which is interesting because 2DX isn't really related to Dance Mania, yet that kind of makes

01:55:26.620 --> 01:55:27.620
sense.

01:55:27.620 --> 01:55:28.620
I don't know.

01:55:28.620 --> 01:55:30.780
Interesting. Maybe it's a Japanese thing. I don't know.

01:55:30.780 --> 01:55:33.940
Alright, here comes a call. Let's check out what's going on.

01:55:33.940 --> 01:55:35.740
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge.

01:55:35.740 --> 01:55:37.740
Hey, what's up?

01:55:37.740 --> 01:55:40.740
I wanted to make a comment on my 2D exploration.

01:55:40.740 --> 01:55:44.740
Hey, we got a little bit of a problem with your bandwidth. You're cutting up a little bit.

01:55:44.740 --> 01:55:46.740
Well, I'm downloading it.

01:55:46.740 --> 01:55:48.740
Weird. Is your stream running?

01:55:48.740 --> 01:55:49.740
Oh, yeah.

01:55:49.740 --> 01:55:52.740
Stop the station if you have the station running.

01:55:53.740 --> 01:55:57.740
Ooh, he's cutting out really bad. Can he say something again?

01:55:58.740 --> 01:56:02.740
Okay, buddy, you're cutting out really bad. I'm sorry. See, try calling back in a little bit.

01:56:02.740 --> 01:56:07.540
back in a little bit. I don't know what's going on there, so sorry about that. That's

01:56:07.540 --> 01:56:23.900
too bad. All right. Well, we'll just try it again in a little bit. We'll keep it open.

01:56:23.900 --> 01:56:28.140
Moving on. Well, with the Skype line still open, if anybody's got a comment on 2DX, what

01:56:28.140 --> 01:56:35.900
think of all this, Loki? I don't play 2DX. All right, Siggy's going to try back. We're

01:56:35.900 --> 01:56:45.940
going to see if it works this time. All right, can you hear us now? Hey, what's up? Huh,

01:56:45.940 --> 01:56:58.060
weird. Well, what's up? You know what, you're still cutting out really, really bad. I'm

01:56:58.060 --> 01:57:01.820
bad I'm sorry we're gonna have to send me a message in the chat room and we'll

01:57:01.820 --> 01:57:06.940
address your comments sorry bud all right weird doesn't want to work we

01:57:06.940 --> 01:57:09.340
were talking to him earlier and it worked fine that's kind of weird maybe

01:57:09.340 --> 01:57:13.900
something on our end somebody downloading porn here in the house all

01:57:13.900 --> 01:57:17.660
right I'll ask them

01:57:17.660 --> 01:57:27.660
Because it's Strider, which is the most awesome game ever.

01:57:27.660 --> 01:57:30.660
Nobody in video games is cooler than Strider here you.

01:57:30.660 --> 01:57:35.660
I asked Ziggy to send me his thoughts over a private message, so we'll address those in a little bit.

01:57:35.660 --> 01:57:40.660
Meanwhile, let's talk about the winner of tonight's cage match, shall we? That'll be exciting.

01:57:40.660 --> 01:57:46.660
Tonight's cage match winner really isn't much of a surprise. Loki wins it again.

01:57:46.660 --> 01:58:02.940
with ecstasy the 14 hours club mix. Congratulation to you my friend. Good job. All right. Okay

01:58:02.940 --> 01:58:11.980
so hey speaking of which, Loki, any sim news you got going on in the world of the simulations?

01:58:11.980 --> 01:58:23.980
Yeah, there's a little bit. Um, starting off with a few things. I downloaded this really cool, uh, theme earlier this week. Um, it was called Technolizer something to the effect.

01:58:23.980 --> 01:58:33.980
Anyways, it's just some really cool, um, uh, StepMania theme that's, I don't know, it's just, it looks a little different than the rest of them. So, that's kinda cool.

01:58:33.980 --> 01:58:39.600
out on StepMania, they have it under the themes forum. It's under a thread called, I found

01:58:39.600 --> 01:58:44.060
this really cool StepMania theme. What? Was that the theme you were showing me the other

01:58:44.060 --> 01:58:47.340
night? Because that was an awesome theme. Yes, that was the one I was showing you the

01:58:47.340 --> 01:58:53.900
other night. Anyways, so there's that one. Other than that, some developments, as far

01:58:53.900 --> 01:58:58.640
as sim stuff goes, there's a guy that figured out how to rip the polygon dancing characters

01:58:58.640 --> 01:59:03.460
out of the DDR games, so he's doing that now. So that's kind of cool. And with that, he's

01:59:03.460 --> 01:59:08.260
also getting all the graphics and background animations from the game, so pretty much everything

01:59:08.260 --> 01:59:15.220
is being able to be ripped from DDR now, so nothing really left. Aside from that, there's

01:59:15.220 --> 01:59:24.940
also a new contest going on, DDR OSC 3, which is another Stepfile contest. It didn't really

01:59:24.940 --> 01:59:31.460
get much, you know, exposure last time, but now it's on, you know, Bomaniacel's plug-in

01:59:31.460 --> 01:59:43.460
So, basically the entry date for that is now August 15th. Submission for files ends on the 22nd, and the first cluster of files will be released on the 29th.

01:59:43.460 --> 01:59:47.460
With results, of course, at the end of each week, just like, you know, Turning Mix.

01:59:47.460 --> 01:59:49.460
And, so those are on there.

01:59:49.460 --> 02:00:05.460
And aside from all that, in case you haven't been following stuff, they actually do have support now being added in Step Mania for a bunch of different game types, including Beat Mania, Dance Maniacs, and TechnoMotion, which I thought was interesting.

02:00:05.460 --> 02:00:15.460
So those you can download actually and play it, and I'm sure Alpha, I think 22 now will be coming out any time now.

02:00:15.460 --> 02:00:18.460
So that's pretty much all that's going on right now.

02:00:22.460 --> 02:00:29.460
Alright, let's see, now what we're going to do, we're going to go to a break I think, and then we'll come back and we'll get into the FUs of the week.

02:00:29.460 --> 02:00:36.460
So if you have something angsty you want to send to us all, go to our chat room and send me a private message with your angst.

02:00:36.460 --> 02:00:41.460
In the meantime, we're going to hear a couple more songs from Poppin' Eleven, and I believe Garrett has another surprise for us.

02:00:41.460 --> 02:00:43.460
So tell us about what we're going to hear this break, Garrett.

02:00:43.460 --> 02:00:48.820
Well first, I picked another song for Rob, it's a remix of one of his songs that has

02:00:48.820 --> 02:00:51.140
a penguin-esque character in it.

02:00:51.140 --> 02:00:55.100
It's a remix of Requiem from Popin' Music 9.

02:00:55.100 --> 02:01:01.240
And then, after that, is a CS9 song, and as you know, all the CS9 songs were on this soundtrack.

02:01:01.240 --> 02:01:08.700
It's Yume To Genjitsu, and it's one of the few songs on here that actually sounds to

02:01:08.700 --> 02:01:10.940
be rearranged slightly.

02:01:10.940 --> 02:01:13.680
was only like one song on here I noticed that on the whole soundtrack that

02:01:13.680 --> 02:01:17.240
sounded like it took a real different turn from how it sounded in the game and

02:01:17.240 --> 02:01:23.400
then last um a remix another remix of yokon co but this is from desk Rose

02:01:23.400 --> 02:01:28.760
album and it's just like a pretty much all heavy metal mix it's strangely it's

02:01:28.760 --> 02:01:33.680
basically game size but they added in another verse so they cut off the

02:01:33.680 --> 02:01:38.660
beginning verse and there's no reggae to it anymore so but it's pretty cool so

02:01:38.660 --> 02:01:45.660
So yeah, all right, let's check it out, starting this set off with a remix of Requiem, enjoy.

02:02:08.660 --> 02:02:10.660
Oh

02:06:38.660 --> 02:06:40.660
Get it, get it, go!

02:07:38.660 --> 02:07:59.100
And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of

02:07:59.100 --> 02:08:02.580
the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.

02:08:02.580 --> 02:08:07.140
Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bamani Music and More program,

02:08:07.140 --> 02:08:08.380
can we talk about that?

02:08:08.380 --> 02:08:12.940
subject will ever be taboo. Well I was thinking maybe we should move pump up

02:08:12.940 --> 02:08:17.080
the volume from Tuesday nights. Except of course the subject that was just under

02:08:17.080 --> 02:08:21.840
discussion. Okay well what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of

02:08:21.840 --> 02:08:27.960
the tack music we play on the station? I collect your fucking head. Just like this

02:08:27.960 --> 02:08:32.880
fucker here. Oh my god why did you do that to

02:08:32.880 --> 02:08:39.600
Loki the holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke now if any of you sons of

02:08:39.600 --> 02:08:45.080
bitches got anything else to say now's the fucking time

02:08:45.080 --> 02:08:54.400

02:09:02.580 --> 02:09:06.740
that promo works again because jamie is moving to pump up the volume to tuesday

02:09:06.740 --> 02:09:08.960
night starting this week

02:09:08.960 --> 02:09:11.940
jamie i know you're over there playing something on uh... loci's

02:09:11.940 --> 02:09:15.600
on loci's main cabinet psycho soldier which is

02:09:15.600 --> 02:09:17.340
which you can see on our web cam

02:09:17.340 --> 02:09:20.480
over at uh... w w w dot uh...

02:09:20.480 --> 02:09:21.640
or something that come

02:09:21.640 --> 02:09:23.760
make up to it

02:09:23.760 --> 02:09:25.760
Well, are we hearing it?

02:09:29.260 --> 02:09:30.760
You died.

02:09:30.760 --> 02:09:33.760
So tell us about Pump Up the Volume while you play Psycho Soldier here.

02:09:33.760 --> 02:09:36.260
Um, I play good music, and that's about it.

02:09:36.260 --> 02:09:37.760
Why are you moving?

02:09:37.760 --> 02:09:39.260
Because I'm going to school.

02:09:39.260 --> 02:09:40.260
Because you're doing your show.

02:09:40.260 --> 02:09:43.260
Alright, so what time on Tuesday nights can we expect to hear your show?

02:09:43.260 --> 02:09:48.260
Um, I'm supposed to start my pre-show at 7 o'clock, so I usually get bored and start it early.

02:09:48.260 --> 02:09:50.760
And then we don't really end on time either.

02:09:50.760 --> 02:09:55.760
Let's go somewhere between 7 and 10. Just tune in to the station.

02:09:55.760 --> 02:09:59.760
Just leave it on all the time, and then maybe you'll hear Katie on Tuesday night.

02:09:59.760 --> 02:10:01.760
Alright, so probably the volume is moving to Tuesdays this week.

02:10:01.760 --> 02:10:04.760
And are you going to be doing the video game music trivia again?

02:10:04.760 --> 02:10:05.760
Eventually.

02:10:05.760 --> 02:10:07.760
Eventually, she says. Alright, we'll see.

02:10:07.760 --> 02:10:11.760
That means Diversion will be moving to Monday nights starting this week,

02:10:11.760 --> 02:10:16.760
so be sure to tune in tomorrow night for all the cool Blamani remixes and all that stuff,

02:10:16.760 --> 02:10:18.760
some good stuff on that show.

02:10:18.760 --> 02:10:23.600
Wednesday nights, we currently have nothing on schedule. Something will be happening with

02:10:23.600 --> 02:10:30.160
my stuff. I just have to kind of do some other things first, because I'm going to be going

02:10:30.160 --> 02:10:33.040
out of town again, so I kind of want to start a show before I go out of town, but we'll

02:10:33.040 --> 02:10:37.600
kind of see what happens. We'll see what happens. I do miss, I do miss Vanilla Sky, though.

02:10:37.600 --> 02:10:41.800
That was a great, that was a great show for me, so. I want to bring it back, we'll see.

02:10:41.800 --> 02:10:44.400
And, Loki, you ever going to do anything, weren't you going to have like a game show

02:10:44.400 --> 02:10:51.240
in 2004? Did that get pushed back to 2005? It got pushed back to 2000 and never. Um,

02:10:51.240 --> 02:10:55.000
I don't know. We'll see. I'm still writing the problems with MAME. I've got to, like,

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:59.280
work on my cabinet a little bit. Like, I have to install more RAM because I'm getting lag

02:10:59.280 --> 02:11:02.880
on, like, some of the keys, and I have to take out Joy to Key and reset all my buttons

02:11:02.880 --> 02:11:16.240
and stuff. Yeah. Now I'm going to get a 512 stick. So anyways, so yeah, I just need more

02:11:16.240 --> 02:11:23.020
RAM and maybe up my processor a bit. We'll see. Alright, Jamie, you got to put the game

02:11:23.020 --> 02:11:29.840
on pause or else you're going to miss your favorite part of the show. You're going to

02:11:29.840 --> 02:11:34.680
miss your favorite part of the show? What would be your favorite part of the show, Jamie?

02:11:34.680 --> 02:11:39.760
The FUs of the Week. That's right. I'm done with Psycho Soldier. So, uh, what do we do

02:11:39.760 --> 02:11:43.400
during the FUs of the Week? Why do we, why do the FUs of the Week exist on this show

02:11:43.400 --> 02:11:45.400
about gaming nerd stuff.

02:11:45.400 --> 02:11:48.400
Cuz, dammit gaming nerds have feelings too!

02:11:48.400 --> 02:12:03.400
Oh, this is bad. Here is justice. Here is punishment. Here is... This is fucked up!

02:12:03.400 --> 02:12:14.640
oh big f you goes to work for being busy busy busy busy busy and just say it was

02:12:14.640 --> 02:12:24.880
busy it's horrendously busy and also a big if she goes toward like well I don't

02:12:24.880 --> 02:12:30.080
know it's just that this week I've been too busy to be angsty about things if

02:12:30.080 --> 02:12:36.960
you can believe that. I'd have to say another one goes toward people who have big patience

02:12:36.960 --> 02:12:43.960
issues and I mean there's some things it's okay to be impatient about but not driving.

02:12:43.960 --> 02:12:49.120
You know, do not change lanes when you are about to hit somebody like this stupid fucker

02:12:49.120 --> 02:12:56.600
behind me who was right on my tail the entire time on the freeway today. I just need to

02:12:56.600 --> 02:13:01.600
to get a Humvee. That's all there is to it. I need to drive a Humvee with an assault rifle.

02:13:01.600 --> 02:13:08.600
Right on the top. And I'll need like a gunner to drive with me. You know, let's say it turns

02:13:08.600 --> 02:13:10.600
and I'll use a gunner and the other person can drive.

02:13:10.600 --> 02:13:15.600
What was that game with the two, where you and your friend would sit in there and like

02:13:15.600 --> 02:13:18.600
crash and, it's like crash and dance or something? Bucky and Wild.

02:13:18.600 --> 02:13:23.600
Bucky and Wild. We had one of those at my arcade that I worked at. But yeah, I need

02:13:23.600 --> 02:13:30.600
I need something like that, or I just need like, you know, like an auto fire or something,

02:13:30.600 --> 02:13:31.600
you know.

02:13:31.600 --> 02:13:37.600
He's seeking, more on seeking missiles, that's what I need on my cars, more on seeking missiles.

02:13:37.600 --> 02:13:44.600
When I first got my new Jetta, the horns were thumb triggers, and I had imagined at one

02:13:44.600 --> 02:13:47.600
point that I would make them into actual thumb triggers.

02:13:47.600 --> 02:13:50.600
Putting missiles in next to the headlights, that would work pretty well.

02:13:50.600 --> 02:13:52.600
I'm sure it's very legal too.

02:13:52.600 --> 02:13:56.600
It is in South Africa, but damn we're not there.

02:13:56.600 --> 02:13:59.600
I just downloaded Lucky and Wild.

02:13:59.600 --> 02:14:06.600
You want to know what sucks, though? As much as I would love to actually get a real Humvee and, you know, remake it,

02:14:06.600 --> 02:14:12.600
you know, you actually cannot get a Humvee anymore because they're now ordered to be destroyed due to some contract deal.

02:14:12.600 --> 02:14:14.600
Doesn't that suck?

02:14:14.600 --> 02:14:15.600
That's interesting.

02:14:15.600 --> 02:14:18.600
Yeah, when they're used up, Humvee goes to the scrap heap.

02:14:18.600 --> 02:14:23.600
They probably hid Bush's medical records in one of those.

02:14:23.600 --> 02:14:25.600
Or the military records.

02:14:25.600 --> 02:14:32.600
For those who didn't hear that whole sentence, Loki said they probably hid Bush's military records in one of those.

02:14:32.600 --> 02:14:35.600
I think they couldn't figure out which ones so they have to destroy them all.

02:14:35.600 --> 02:14:37.600
By accident.

02:14:37.600 --> 02:14:43.600
No, it has to do with when they were put out on the market.

02:14:43.600 --> 02:14:53.600
There was, like, some order for them not to be resold, so they were actually, quote, given to a distributor who sold them for the military and got the money back.

02:14:53.600 --> 02:14:57.600
But, uh, that was all. Now they have to all be destroyed.

02:14:57.600 --> 02:14:59.600
Doesn't that suck?

02:14:59.600 --> 02:15:03.600
I'm still going to get a Humvee one day.

02:15:03.600 --> 02:15:05.600
I'm gonna paint it camo.

02:15:05.600 --> 02:15:08.600
And put myself a big ol' gun at the top of it.

02:15:08.600 --> 02:15:11.600
And drive that shit around.

02:15:11.600 --> 02:15:14.600
I don't care if the gun works, I'm going to have one on there.

02:15:14.600 --> 02:15:23.600
It's going to be like in Cruise and World, where you could drive the Hummer with the gun.

02:15:23.600 --> 02:15:25.600
I remember that.

02:15:25.600 --> 02:15:30.600
It was always either that, the school bus, or the three-wheel truck that I would use.

02:15:30.600 --> 02:15:33.600
You talking about Cruise and World makes me think about Nintendo arcade games,

02:15:33.600 --> 02:15:36.600
which makes me think about how I really want to play Killer Instinct.

02:15:36.600 --> 02:15:38.600
It still says Ultra 64 on it, isn't that sad?

02:15:38.600 --> 02:15:39.600
I want to play Killer Instinct.

02:15:39.600 --> 02:15:40.600
Dude, I love Killer Instinct.

02:15:40.600 --> 02:15:42.600
Anyway, sorry to interrupt.

02:15:42.600 --> 02:15:44.600
F.U. to Killer Instinct for dying.

02:15:44.600 --> 02:15:46.600
We miss you.

02:15:46.600 --> 02:15:48.600
Killer Instinct.

02:15:48.600 --> 02:15:51.600
And F.U. goes toward Mortal Kombat Annihilation.

02:15:51.600 --> 02:15:53.600
Cause I finally saw it.

02:15:53.600 --> 02:15:55.600
How could a movie that sucks-

02:15:55.600 --> 02:15:57.600
Welcome to five years ago, oh my god.

02:15:57.600 --> 02:16:00.600
I knew it was gonna suck, so I just didn't bother seeing it.

02:16:00.600 --> 02:16:03.600
But Ross made me watch it yesterday.

02:16:03.600 --> 02:16:06.600
I brought over The Last Samurai, good movie.

02:16:06.600 --> 02:16:08.600
You know what you need to play in that main cabinet right now?

02:16:08.600 --> 02:16:16.080
Street Fighter 2 the movie the game. Ah no hell no I played that game that game is deep it is so

02:16:17.160 --> 02:16:19.160
Ass-tastic you wouldn't even believe

02:16:20.600 --> 02:16:25.160
The best thing about playing Street Fighter 2 the movie the game though is playing as Kami

02:16:25.960 --> 02:16:27.400
to address

02:16:27.400 --> 02:16:32.680
Anita you actually cannot buy them army surplus anymore because they're meant to they have to be destroyed

02:16:33.880 --> 02:16:35.280
Okay

02:16:35.280 --> 02:16:38.280
People are asking me stuff and I can't read the chat room.

02:16:38.280 --> 02:16:41.280
Street Fighter 2, the movie, the game, they have to see it.

02:16:41.280 --> 02:16:44.280
I'll relay if there's any other stuff.

02:16:44.280 --> 02:16:46.280
You'll have to buy your own M60.

02:16:46.280 --> 02:16:47.280
Okay.

02:16:47.280 --> 02:16:48.280
Alright.

02:16:48.280 --> 02:16:53.280
But another F.U. goes toward how long it's going to take for me to get done with school.

02:16:53.280 --> 02:16:57.280
Because I'm probably going to be done, um, probably...

02:16:57.280 --> 02:17:01.280
If I can do it right 2006, which is going to, um...

02:17:01.280 --> 02:17:05.840
I mean it's an okay thing because that means that I have more time to get in shape and

02:17:05.840 --> 02:17:12.560
everything but I'm still planning on going into the Air Force Reserves so once I lose

02:17:12.560 --> 02:17:18.560
a little bit more weight but I just didn't want to have to wait another two years instead

02:17:18.560 --> 02:17:21.660
of one so it's pissing me off.

02:17:21.660 --> 02:17:26.960
And another SU to Alabama for being so far away because I want to go home.

02:17:26.960 --> 02:17:31.560
There's, there's certain places that I want to visit, certain places that, certain people

02:17:31.560 --> 02:17:32.560
I want to see.

02:17:32.560 --> 02:17:33.560
And I'm broke.

02:17:33.560 --> 02:17:34.560
And I have no time off.

02:17:34.560 --> 02:17:37.560
I have two days off for the rest of the year.

02:17:37.560 --> 02:17:40.760
Not counting, though, the one day where I have to get to the dentist.

02:17:40.760 --> 02:17:44.480
That means I can't get sick, because I got sick right at the beginning of the year.

02:17:44.480 --> 02:17:47.600
I had all that surgery and all this other crap.

02:17:47.600 --> 02:17:52.840
And then also, I need more days off so that I can do other stuff next year that I want

02:17:52.840 --> 02:17:54.400
to do.

02:17:54.400 --> 02:18:01.400
F you to me having to wait for two weeks to get my laptop, because I want it now.

02:18:01.400 --> 02:18:06.400
See, it's okay to be impatient about getting a laptop, because your laptops are cool.

02:18:06.400 --> 02:18:10.400
But I found a pretty one getting this nice tajitsu with the DVD-R,

02:18:10.400 --> 02:18:14.400
so I can finally burn off all the crap on my hard drive and reformat,

02:18:14.400 --> 02:18:17.400
because I'm going to have to start sharing it with Dan,

02:18:17.400 --> 02:18:23.400
because he turned his computer into a main machine, built into a pole position.

02:18:23.400 --> 02:18:24.900
you're going to see tonight

02:18:24.900 --> 02:18:26.980
longest you've taken your at least for a while

02:18:26.980 --> 02:18:28.140
and for a while

02:18:28.140 --> 02:18:29.500
i don't know i'm just

02:18:29.500 --> 02:18:31.740
you know what it is okay

02:18:31.740 --> 02:18:33.740
you're a very old

02:18:33.740 --> 02:18:34.700
set up

02:18:34.700 --> 02:18:39.300
that excuse for women being upset

02:18:39.300 --> 02:18:42.220
you know i love you

02:18:42.220 --> 02:18:45.720
and bumpy kick your ass

02:18:45.720 --> 02:18:49.380
i got to do the right thing i've ever seen that he was cute i have to say

02:18:49.380 --> 02:18:51.300
that if i do you in the movie

02:18:51.300 --> 02:18:52.620
thank you

02:18:52.620 --> 02:18:55.000
oh my god though i mean

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:56.620
well i i i think any

02:18:56.620 --> 02:18:59.740
street fighter to the movie the game

02:18:59.740 --> 02:19:03.620
yeah i love how they play little clips from the movie and everything

02:19:03.620 --> 02:19:09.260
you know i don't think that it was all of that bad

02:19:09.260 --> 02:19:10.300
and it was

02:19:10.300 --> 02:19:14.160
the movie was that the game is actually kind of okay to play

02:19:14.160 --> 02:19:18.340
i thought it was very funny

02:19:18.340 --> 02:19:24.100
at the chat and i think that this is an area webcam or something like that

02:19:24.100 --> 02:19:30.340
all right anyway anymore if you seem to me

02:19:30.340 --> 02:19:31.820
i have and at the end

02:19:31.820 --> 02:19:35.300
you um...

02:19:35.300 --> 02:19:36.420
man just

02:19:36.420 --> 02:19:38.700
uh... okay just

02:19:38.700 --> 02:19:44.700
i think at the end

02:19:44.700 --> 02:19:45.900
i haven't at the

02:19:45.900 --> 02:19:48.140
you uh... politics

02:19:48.140 --> 02:19:50.780
and military

02:19:50.780 --> 02:19:53.840
i have a big f you go to go to q r o

02:19:53.840 --> 02:19:56.960
because they're doing a uh... storage white

02:19:56.960 --> 02:19:58.780
let me know that i had been

02:19:58.780 --> 02:20:02.040
seventy eight different individual items

02:20:02.040 --> 02:20:05.120
among four characters on q r o

02:20:05.120 --> 02:20:09.860
and then i tried to freakin then so i can get rid of some of my shit

02:20:09.860 --> 02:20:11.380
it wouldn't let me then instead

02:20:11.380 --> 02:20:14.920
it just wouldn't let said i don't know that no and i had to pay the items that

02:20:14.920 --> 02:20:18.920
other people are vending so this is really pissing me off. Do I have to have a vending license to

02:20:18.920 --> 02:20:23.920
vendor this crap? Because I can make so much zenny in that game but no. And then

02:20:23.920 --> 02:20:28.920
an F.U. goes toward me not being able to afford to do Final Fantasy 11 because I'm going to start playing again and also

02:20:28.920 --> 02:20:33.920
with my laptop I'd be able to keep typing to people while I'm playing Final Fantasy 11 but now I can't do it so it's really pissing me off and

02:20:33.920 --> 02:20:38.920
I'm out of breath.

02:20:38.920 --> 02:20:43.280
I'm having to like write this all down to follow I'm

02:20:43.280 --> 02:20:46.680
I am and if you do

02:20:46.680 --> 02:20:53.680
bad-tasting but perfectly textured low-carb cheesecake

02:20:54.200 --> 02:20:58.840
and any more I'm waiting and all right they're moving on low-key

02:20:58.840 --> 02:21:02.560
wait what nevermind moving

02:21:02.560 --> 02:21:06.320
land let's see who's our Mr. Yeses

02:21:06.320 --> 02:21:07.320
Hey Jonas, alright.

02:21:07.320 --> 02:21:09.320
No, just during this video part of the show too.

02:21:09.320 --> 02:21:12.320
Alright, uh, let's get to, uh, Loki's part.

02:21:12.320 --> 02:21:17.320
First off, fuck you, the crack whores that try to cut me off when the lanes are merging.

02:21:17.320 --> 02:21:20.320
Okay, so I was driving to take, um, my fiancee home.

02:21:20.320 --> 02:21:24.320
Okay, and the lanes are merging, we've already established, you know, it's already one lane,

02:21:24.320 --> 02:21:27.320
and we're just, like, coming together, you know, to be in parallel.

02:21:27.320 --> 02:21:28.320
So what does that bitch do?

02:21:28.320 --> 02:21:33.320
She tries to cut around me through a double yellow on the opposite side of the street,

02:21:33.320 --> 02:21:35.320
like, going the wrong direction.

02:21:35.320 --> 02:21:39.400
through there and like passes me up to get behind this really slow guy that's

02:21:39.400 --> 02:21:45.360
in front of me I'm like what the hell so I flipped her off as I went by and tried

02:21:45.360 --> 02:21:48.760
yelling at her but you know she was ahead of me so she probably couldn't hear me over my

02:21:48.760 --> 02:21:53.360
music but um yeah it was she was a dumb bitch I normally don't flip people off I

02:21:53.360 --> 02:21:58.880
just yell but this bitch pushed me that far so fuck you to her and fuck you to

02:21:58.880 --> 02:22:03.360
cosplayers they're fucking ugly okay if you're a big fat whore you don't need to

02:22:03.360 --> 02:22:06.380
dressing up like an anime character doesn't make you hotter doesn't make you

02:22:06.380 --> 02:22:11.080
any cooler it just makes you ugly and stupid looking and if you're if you're a

02:22:11.080 --> 02:22:16.400
hairy man please don't cosplay Yuna yes I really I hate you know seeing these

02:22:16.400 --> 02:22:20.520
ugly ass people cosplaying we don't need any more ugly people in the world to die

02:22:20.520 --> 02:22:24.280
one thing in defense I think that if you don't have the body to do like the

02:22:24.280 --> 02:22:28.720
scantily clad on a matrix that's one thing the last time I checked

02:22:28.720 --> 02:22:30.880
um... you didn't have a gut

02:22:30.880 --> 02:22:33.040
himself

02:22:33.040 --> 02:22:33.820
anyway

02:22:33.820 --> 02:22:35.920
and all of us in the building

02:22:35.920 --> 02:22:37.240
there's a lot of heat

02:22:37.240 --> 02:22:38.840
not part of the group

02:22:38.840 --> 02:22:40.680
figure out

02:22:40.680 --> 02:22:42.440
and uh...

02:22:42.440 --> 02:22:46.480
all that you know what do you know that that will anything which is retarded

02:22:46.480 --> 02:22:50.400
okay it was just a really were a waste of my time you know the overcharging

02:22:50.400 --> 02:22:50.960
stuff

02:22:50.960 --> 02:22:53.840
last time i checked you know i don't think people are quite anything to do

02:22:53.840 --> 02:22:58.240
anime but you know hey that she was there too

02:22:58.240 --> 02:23:00.760
and also it's just uh... plane

02:23:00.760 --> 02:23:03.940
but you know i can't make it because for some reason the wheels are saying the

02:23:03.940 --> 02:23:05.640
push through the bottom of course

02:23:05.640 --> 02:23:08.080
not good if i want to move this thing

02:23:08.080 --> 02:23:12.160
said like on a lower at pedestal right now i think i thought

02:23:12.160 --> 02:23:14.280
and then uh...

02:23:14.280 --> 02:23:16.540
but you know what they thought the mall

02:23:16.540 --> 02:23:19.840
i think i could just get younger and younger

02:23:19.840 --> 02:23:22.840
just all these what's out there if they were never around when i was in the

02:23:22.840 --> 02:23:25.600
interior high that really fucked

02:23:25.600 --> 02:23:29.240
and that's it

02:23:29.240 --> 02:23:30.720
uh...

02:23:30.720 --> 02:23:37.720
i'm going back to my old f u song because it was better bumblebee

02:23:39.940 --> 02:23:42.720
f u to uh...

02:23:42.720 --> 02:23:46.200
lehigh county in pennsylvania for being so god damn boring

02:23:46.200 --> 02:23:49.840
although you know i ask you to myself for not being more proactive about

02:23:49.840 --> 02:23:52.320
finding things to do

02:23:52.320 --> 02:23:55.340
i think next time when i go back because i'm gonna have to go back eventually

02:23:55.340 --> 02:24:01.180
I'll be better prepared for it because I'm going to look up where I can go nerd out and play DDR and stuff, so I'll have a better time.

02:24:01.180 --> 02:24:07.340
But they did have one gay bar there, which I went to, and FU'd to the fact that there were only like 30 people in the whole place,

02:24:07.340 --> 02:24:10.300
considering this is the only gay bar for like hundreds of miles around town.

02:24:10.300 --> 02:24:13.660
But whatever, what can you do?

02:24:13.660 --> 02:24:19.020
Also, I'd like to give an FU for coming home and thinking the TV was stolen,

02:24:19.020 --> 02:24:24.660
and then realizing that Loki had taken the TV and put it in the machine. What?

02:24:24.660 --> 02:24:26.480
yet he'd been liberated

02:24:26.480 --> 02:24:28.140
but i ask you to add

02:24:28.140 --> 02:24:30.860
my future friends reaction when they come in this house realize you have to

02:24:30.860 --> 02:24:31.900
watch movies

02:24:31.900 --> 02:24:34.060
uh... in an arcade machine

02:24:34.060 --> 02:24:37.820
telling differently about that are figured out

02:24:37.820 --> 02:24:40.780
i think it's interesting

02:24:40.780 --> 02:24:45.320
very interesting uh... at the ud to the fact that at your working ten to twelve

02:24:45.320 --> 02:24:47.700
hour days because i guess really old after a while

02:24:47.700 --> 02:24:51.620
and um... at the beginning on salary so you know the time for it

02:24:51.620 --> 02:24:53.940
uh... and that's about it

02:24:53.940 --> 02:24:59.180
that's really all i have to say i'm i'm always the left a few ones of the bunch

02:24:59.180 --> 02:25:01.660
anyway let's move on and uh... see what

02:25:01.660 --> 02:25:03.580
our folks in the uh...

02:25:03.580 --> 02:25:07.000
other folks in the room here so i have to say anything i get

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:07.980
uh...

02:25:07.980 --> 02:25:10.940
by the way it's a nephew music tonight brought to us by a

02:25:10.940 --> 02:25:12.420
rio kosaka

02:25:12.420 --> 02:25:16.340
probably i got a happy thought i think it was not to get this to be happy

02:25:16.340 --> 02:25:19.020
uh... damn okay at the end of the song

02:25:19.020 --> 02:25:19.980
uh... even though

02:25:19.980 --> 02:25:22.380
i like candy

02:25:22.380 --> 02:25:23.700
but i got tired of it

02:25:23.700 --> 02:25:25.820
played it out too many times, DDR.

02:25:25.820 --> 02:25:28.140
uh... fuck you starts off with my sister

02:25:28.140 --> 02:25:29.680
for being the bitch that she is

02:25:29.680 --> 02:25:31.600
i haven't seen her in two weeks

02:25:31.600 --> 02:25:33.300
and then the minute i

02:25:33.300 --> 02:25:35.500
she walks in the door

02:25:35.500 --> 02:25:37.960
she instantly starts being a bitch

02:25:37.960 --> 02:25:39.360
about everything

02:25:39.360 --> 02:25:40.460
uh... but

02:25:40.460 --> 02:25:42.180
fuck her for making me

02:25:42.180 --> 02:25:44.100
chase the mailman

02:25:44.100 --> 02:25:45.600
uh...

02:25:45.600 --> 02:25:50.580
fuck her for lying to me and saying that mom knew she was

02:25:50.580 --> 02:25:51.860
drinking and that

02:25:51.860 --> 02:25:56.820
she could have some of my Smirnoff shit that was at my party and leaving it in my mom's

02:25:56.820 --> 02:25:59.060
room and stuff.

02:25:59.060 --> 02:26:00.060
Oops.

02:26:00.060 --> 02:26:06.980
Yeah, well I didn't get in trouble for it, she did.

02:26:06.980 --> 02:26:12.020
FuckTower for having such great sales and making me buy even more toys.

02:26:12.020 --> 02:26:19.260
They had a three day sale this week that was 25% off all their toys and I purchased twice

02:26:19.260 --> 02:26:21.360
online

02:26:21.360 --> 02:26:22.400
really big

02:26:22.400 --> 02:26:24.160
to uh...

02:26:24.160 --> 02:26:29.520
but me for having uh... across right now that makes me feel like i'm sixteen

02:26:29.520 --> 02:26:31.800
the world is going to revolve around it

02:26:31.800 --> 02:26:34.560
uh... i think it's fucking ridiculous and i need to

02:26:34.560 --> 02:26:37.820
i hope i'm just having mail p m s or something

02:26:37.820 --> 02:26:39.420

02:26:39.420 --> 02:26:40.560
that's me for

02:26:40.560 --> 02:26:44.200

02:26:44.200 --> 02:26:45.720
masturbate

02:26:45.720 --> 02:26:50.720
I'm getting kind of tired of that right now.

02:26:50.720 --> 02:26:53.720
Fuck.

02:26:53.720 --> 02:26:58.720
Fuck my anal-retentiveness and me not being happy with my room and stuff.

02:26:58.720 --> 02:27:03.720
And I don't really have any more angstiness.

02:27:03.720 --> 02:27:04.720
Alright, moving on now.

02:27:04.720 --> 02:27:07.720
Bug, do you have any FUs to give?

02:27:07.720 --> 02:27:08.720
It's coming.

02:27:08.720 --> 02:27:10.720
A microphone's coming to you, Bug.

02:27:10.720 --> 02:27:14.720
It's mainly just a big ol' FU to my computer for not working.

02:27:14.720 --> 02:27:17.240
the back of course

02:27:17.240 --> 02:27:23.360
all right ever break nice night

02:27:23.360 --> 02:27:27.280
no everything else that fixed this week

02:27:27.280 --> 02:27:29.900
so you don't have to be up to be reported to a m

02:27:29.900 --> 02:27:32.280
action like that everybody

02:27:32.280 --> 02:27:33.200
uh...

02:27:33.200 --> 02:27:37.320
let's go to a jonas who showed up during uh... there are going to be doing it

02:27:37.320 --> 02:27:40.000
also known as explicit with the triple x

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:41.000
Yeah.

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:42.000
Alright, what's up?

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:43.000
Uh, not much.

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:45.000
Should I just put my F's right now?

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:46.000
Yeah, get them out.

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:47.000
Okay.

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:48.000
Remember, it's a three hour show.

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:52.000
Don't worry, I don't have that many F's this time.

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:54.000
Yeah, we gotta turn, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:56.000
Back your mic up a little bit.

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:57.000
Is it really that loud?

02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:58.000
Yes, yes it is.

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:00.000
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:01.000
Okay.

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:04.000
F you to me for being wrong last minute this whole week.

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:09.000
God, showing up to work like fifteen minutes late is not good.

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:15.000
Anybody heard about the Biggest Field California Tournament?

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:17.000
No.

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:18.000
What's this?

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:28.000
Good, because I went to hell, so I'm going to give an FU to some of the organizers for not looking up how tournaments are supposed to be run.

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:31.000
Because you know how tournaments are done by PA, right?

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:32.000
Right.

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.000
They did it by score.

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:36.000
Oh dear.

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:42.000
There's a lot of problems with that, and they're not taking constructive criticism from other people, which is another bad thing.

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:43.000
That's not a good sign.

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:48.000
They think it's all good and everything, but there are some flaws that they should listen to.

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:55.000
On the other hand, FV2 sent people who tried to ruin the tournament for two hours.

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:58.000
I heard rumors about a two-hour delay on that tournament.

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:04.000
I'm not sure if that's true or not, but I'll say FV2 really screwed up my tournament.

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:06.960
Even though I've heard rumors it was in Zumel 469

02:29:06.960 --> 02:29:08.940
The winner did the same thing to my tournament

02:29:08.940 --> 02:29:11.800
And if that's true, he's banned out of my tournament

02:29:12.300 --> 02:29:13.860
I'm serious cuz nobody

02:29:13.860 --> 02:29:16.320
Should be banning a tournament for THAT long

02:29:16.320 --> 02:29:18.580
Screwing a tournament for 2 hours is not fun

02:29:18.580 --> 02:29:20.220
Especially when people have

02:29:20.220 --> 02:29:21.880
To drive all the way back

02:29:21.880 --> 02:29:25.800
from San Francisco, California or Fresno or even SoCal

02:29:25.800 --> 02:29:28.220
Just to go to the tournament to late on getting—

02:29:28.220 --> 02:29:30.380
Delayed for a whole while and getting pissed off because

02:29:30.380 --> 02:29:31.760
Blahblahblah

02:29:31.760 --> 02:29:33.420
WAAAHwhahwha

02:29:33.420 --> 02:29:35.420
Wham, my pussy hurts, wham.

02:29:35.420 --> 02:29:36.420
Yeah, damn pussy.

02:29:36.420 --> 02:29:39.420
Here's the thing, get this right, you guys.

02:29:39.420 --> 02:29:41.420
If you don't like the rules of the tournament, don't go.

02:29:41.420 --> 02:29:42.420
It's simple as that.

02:29:42.420 --> 02:29:47.420
If you go to the tournament and you know the rules are fucked up, and you go, you gotta argue, you're just causing some trouble.

02:29:49.420 --> 02:29:51.420
Now what would you let it do?

02:29:51.420 --> 02:29:53.420
Would you do something like that, dumb skye? Or?

02:29:53.420 --> 02:29:55.420
No, but I'll prob-

02:29:55.420 --> 02:30:02.420
Sacramento's so sad now at Bomani, I'm probably not even gonna ever run a tournament or even help run a tournament ever again, so we'll see.

02:30:02.420 --> 02:30:06.420
I mean, I'll still run tournaments, regardless of what's going on and stuff.

02:30:06.420 --> 02:30:09.420
But I would never run one by score, that's for sure.

02:30:09.420 --> 02:30:12.420
I know, that's one thing. Never run by score.

02:30:13.420 --> 02:30:14.420
Let's see...

02:30:14.420 --> 02:30:18.420
F you to squirrels for eating my damn food from camping.

02:30:19.420 --> 02:30:20.420
I don't...

02:30:20.420 --> 02:30:28.420
Seeing a bunch of spit all over the damn steak that I've cooked for two hours and shit is not good.

02:30:28.420 --> 02:30:32.420
Therefore, even though I whipped the living shit out of those squirrels,

02:30:32.420 --> 02:30:35.420
I'm not sure if you all saw this whip right here.

02:30:35.420 --> 02:30:37.420
Did you borrow that from Aaron?

02:30:37.420 --> 02:30:41.420
No, this is mine, dammit! I told you that I have my own whip.

02:30:41.420 --> 02:30:45.420
I should have showed Aaron this whip, I'm not sure if she's interested.

02:30:47.420 --> 02:30:52.420
An amputee getting bit by- bit by ass by ants during camping.

02:30:54.420 --> 02:30:55.420
Ouch.

02:30:55.420 --> 02:30:57.420
No fucking comment on that one.

02:30:57.420 --> 02:30:57.920
Alright.

02:30:58.920 --> 02:31:01.420
And after you for losing my toothbrush during camping.

02:31:02.420 --> 02:31:04.420
Not brushing your teeth for two days sucks.

02:31:04.420 --> 02:31:05.420
Maybe a bear stole it.

02:31:06.420 --> 02:31:08.420
Speaking of that, I saw a bear during camping.

02:31:09.420 --> 02:31:10.420
Did you see Bigfoot?

02:31:10.420 --> 02:31:12.420
Yes, I saw a Bigfoot. I did not get eaten.

02:31:12.420 --> 02:31:15.420
He was just walking around sniffing on those pussies and stuff.

02:31:17.420 --> 02:31:18.420
That's okay.

02:31:21.420 --> 02:31:23.420
Was he pussyfooting around?

02:31:24.420 --> 02:31:25.420
Yes, he was pussyfooting around.

02:31:25.420 --> 02:31:32.420
around. Um, and F you for the horse for fucking sweeping the tail that he took a shit on in

What do you guys want to do? Do you want to do some Ask Orange Lounge, or do we have...

Alright, sure, why not. We'll do some Ask Orange Lounge.

02:36:17.760 --> 02:36:19.760
On the Skypline.

02:36:19.760 --> 02:36:21.760
Yeah, we'll do... We'll open up the Skypline, and folks...

Meanwhile, I'm going to pick some songs that sound cool for the Popin' Eleven soundtrack.

02:36:29.160 --> 02:36:33.080
I'm going to pick some on my own, because I know I want to play the Orange Airport song.

02:36:33.080 --> 02:36:35.800
I definitely want to play that, the Orange Lounge song.

02:36:35.800 --> 02:36:41.320
And I'm going to play that one because it's called Space Dog.

02:36:41.320 --> 02:36:42.320
Oh, and it's Sana.

02:36:42.320 --> 02:36:43.320
Cool.

02:36:43.320 --> 02:36:44.320

02:36:44.320 --> 02:36:54.560

02:37:05.200 --> 02:37:09.480
All right, we're going to do Hillbilly.

02:37:09.480 --> 02:37:12.920
Okay so these are the songs I'm going to play this break from Popin' Music 11.

02:37:12.920 --> 02:37:18.000
We're going to hear Orange Lounge with Orange Airline, Sauna with Space Dog, and Taisho

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:20.040
in the hillbilly genre with PaLaLa42.

02:37:20.040 --> 02:37:23.260
This should be interesting.

02:37:23.260 --> 02:37:26.620

02:37:26.620 --> 02:37:27.620

You take my blood and I know

02:40:00.120 --> 02:40:02.620
You can hear me

02:40:02.620 --> 02:40:04.620
I'm fable

02:40:04.620 --> 02:40:09.620
You're far enough to fly away

02:40:09.620 --> 02:40:13.620
I remember the time

02:40:13.620 --> 02:40:18.120
When I walked home

02:40:18.120 --> 02:40:26.120
He was watching to me, in the games that made me glad

02:40:27.120 --> 02:40:34.120
One day he told to me, I thought that you were dead

02:40:35.120 --> 02:40:44.120
I let him go, he was my friend, never mind your people and I

02:40:44.120 --> 02:40:49.120
Hello there, hello there, hello there.

02:40:49.120 --> 02:40:53.120
Nothing but the only one.

02:40:53.120 --> 02:40:58.120
Can you hear me, hello there.

02:40:58.120 --> 02:41:02.120
You're the only one in the light.

02:41:02.120 --> 02:41:06.120
Hello there, hello there.

02:41:06.120 --> 02:41:10.120
It's too easy for you to hold on tight.

02:41:10.120 --> 02:41:14.620
Don't hate on me, I'm afraid it's true

02:41:14.620 --> 02:41:22.620
I don't care if you love me, I care if you love me, I care if you love me

02:43:14.620 --> 02:43:19.200
Orange Lounge Radio,

02:43:19.200 --> 02:43:22.200
Bimani Music, and more.

02:43:22.200 --> 02:43:28.000
All right, we are back here with Orange Lounge Radio, and the last fifteen

02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:28.840
minutes of the show,

02:43:28.840 --> 02:43:32.080
this is where we usually open it up to ask Orange Lounge

02:43:32.080 --> 02:43:36.120
some questions. Also, the Skypline's open...

02:43:36.120 --> 02:43:41.180
I'm sorry? Oh, okay. And also, the Skypline we open up at this time in case you have a

02:43:41.180 --> 02:43:43.320
question you want to ask us over the Skypline,

02:43:43.320 --> 02:43:46.680
or you just have a general comment on something we've talked about

02:43:46.680 --> 02:43:50.280
previously in the show as we kind of wind things down. But we're going to start off with some

02:43:50.280 --> 02:43:57.000
Ask Orange Lounge.

02:43:57.000 --> 02:44:00.160
Let's Ask Orange Lounge. Some stupid question.

02:44:00.160 --> 02:44:03.920
What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

02:44:03.920 --> 02:44:07.560
I know I have a question. One thing I want to find out.

02:44:07.560 --> 02:44:11.560
Why is Loki playing a game where guys are shaving other guys?

02:44:17.560 --> 02:44:22.560
Question number one comes from StupidBaka

02:44:22.560 --> 02:44:25.560
Where did you go when you were out of town?

02:44:25.560 --> 02:44:28.560
I went to Allentown, Pennsylvania

02:44:28.560 --> 02:44:31.560
which is about an hour north of Philadelphia

02:44:31.560 --> 02:44:34.560
and it's very green out there

02:44:34.560 --> 02:44:38.400
and there's a restaurant called friendlies which is which is cute

02:44:38.400 --> 02:44:41.380
which i think is actually a chain out there i don't know i'm so

02:44:41.380 --> 02:44:44.140
like there's probably east coast people listening to show going

02:44:44.140 --> 02:44:48.940
nothing special last time i was on the east coast there was that roy rogers place that was utter crap

02:44:48.940 --> 02:44:53.660
i went to cracker barrel and that place owns

02:44:53.660 --> 02:44:57.080
and i i have clove candy sticks from cracker barrel in my room

02:44:57.080 --> 02:44:59.220
because they got me some as a going away present

02:44:59.220 --> 02:45:01.780
thank you so much to the folks i know that of course they would never listen to the show

02:45:01.780 --> 02:45:03.780
But the folks out there were so good to me.

02:45:03.780 --> 02:45:05.780
I mean, they made that town bearable, honestly.

02:45:05.780 --> 02:45:08.780
And, uh, they bought me gifts and stuff, so that was great.

02:45:08.780 --> 02:45:11.780
Uh, Stupid Baka also wants to know, and I can't believe somebody's asking this, but...

02:45:11.780 --> 02:45:13.780
What is MAME?

02:45:13.780 --> 02:45:15.780
What?

02:45:15.780 --> 02:45:17.780
It's the Multi Arcade Machine Emulator.

02:45:17.780 --> 02:45:19.780
Caller, hold on a minute. I'll get to you in a minute.

02:45:19.780 --> 02:45:22.780
But, uh, what is MAME is the person wants to know.

Oh, they hung up. Oh well.

02:45:26.780 --> 02:45:28.780

here's a question

02:46:14.920 --> 02:46:17.360
Why is Jamie so damn angsty tonight?

02:46:17.360 --> 02:46:20.520
Her rants were as long as the horror of the village.

02:46:20.520 --> 02:46:22.920
The village was good!

02:46:22.920 --> 02:46:27.640
I can't help it if the majority of people who saw that movie didn't stop to think about it,

02:46:27.640 --> 02:46:28.720
but still,

02:46:28.720 --> 02:46:31.320
it was a very good movie, okay?

02:46:31.320 --> 02:46:35.120
Alright, well moving on, why are you so angsty tonight? Is that why you're so angsty, or...?

02:46:35.120 --> 02:46:40.880
No, I'm angsty for other, other reasons.

02:46:40.880 --> 02:46:42.360
Many of them.

02:46:42.360 --> 02:46:46.000
many reasons many reasons it's ok to be angry once in a while

02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:50.420
it's this time of year is when i get really horribly angsty like that which is weird because with

02:46:50.420 --> 02:46:52.920
me i'm

02:46:52.920 --> 02:46:54.600
torah would just like to point out

02:46:54.600 --> 02:46:57.240
they've actually never seen the village they were just saying that's rufflesome

02:46:57.240 --> 02:47:00.000
feathers well then go see it

02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:02.520
it's a good movie

02:47:02.520 --> 02:47:03.420
alright

02:47:03.420 --> 02:47:04.540
it was a

02:47:04.540 --> 02:47:07.720
not just a good movie it was an excellent it was a movie

02:47:07.720 --> 02:47:08.840
it was a very

02:47:08.840 --> 02:47:11.080
smart movie okay uh... it was

02:47:11.080 --> 02:47:12.320
sharks girl says

02:47:12.320 --> 02:47:18.760
I thought about the movie and I still thought it sucked.

02:47:18.760 --> 02:47:21.520
Then you obviously didn't watch it with the right frame of mind.

02:47:21.520 --> 02:47:22.520
Well.

02:47:22.520 --> 02:47:25.000
It wasn't intended to scare.

02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:28.620
I think it's getting mixed reviews so it's probably just getting mixed feedback from

02:47:28.620 --> 02:47:30.220
everybody you know.

02:47:30.220 --> 02:47:32.160
It wasn't scary, it was very good.

02:47:32.160 --> 02:47:34.720
It was the type of movie I was right in the mood to see.

02:47:34.720 --> 02:47:38.140
I don't see but now I'm kind of like I've heard so many like negative things but I've

02:47:38.140 --> 02:47:41.800
heard some good things but I'm kind of like now maybe I'll wait for video.

02:47:41.800 --> 02:47:42.800
I don't know.

02:47:42.800 --> 02:47:43.800
Okay, Rob.

02:47:43.800 --> 02:47:46.880
You are going to go see it with me and I'm going to pay for you to see it.

02:47:46.880 --> 02:47:48.480
Well, hey, free movie.

02:47:48.480 --> 02:47:49.480
All right.

02:47:49.480 --> 02:47:50.480
I'll let you guys know what I thought.

02:47:50.480 --> 02:47:51.480
We'll see.

02:47:51.480 --> 02:47:52.480
We'll see.

02:47:52.480 --> 02:47:53.480
All right.

02:47:53.480 --> 02:47:54.480
Moving on.

02:47:54.480 --> 02:47:55.480
Let's see.

02:47:55.480 --> 02:47:58.480
I got his questions.

02:47:58.480 --> 02:48:07.240
Kyle, our old buddy, Kyle Snyder, wants to know, I've decided that for the next few songs

02:48:07.240 --> 02:48:11.200
I want to work on, I want to move away from techno and trance.

02:48:11.200 --> 02:48:18.600
Would you want me to work on some genres that involve vocals like house, two-step, and jazz?

02:48:18.600 --> 02:48:23.440
Or should I do some non-vocal genres like drum and bass, progressive, and big beat?

02:48:23.440 --> 02:48:25.880
I would love to hear some drum and bass.

02:48:25.880 --> 02:48:29.280
I like drum and bass too, but I would like to hear some two-step from Kyle, actually.

02:48:29.280 --> 02:48:33.880
I think that would be kind of cool.

02:48:33.880 --> 02:48:36.000
That would be kind of neat, I think.

02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:37.000
We'll see.

02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:42.560
Alright, um, but I guess does anybody else have any feedback for Trump?

02:48:42.560 --> 02:48:43.560
Anybody?

02:48:43.560 --> 02:48:44.560
Anybody?

02:48:44.560 --> 02:48:45.560
Alright.

02:48:45.560 --> 02:48:46.560
Fine.

02:48:46.560 --> 02:48:47.560
Keep it to yourselves.

02:48:47.560 --> 02:48:53.080
DDRholic wants to know, do you still love me Rob?

02:48:53.080 --> 02:48:56.240
The answer is yes.

02:48:56.240 --> 02:49:00.240
Just like Whitney Houston, I will always love you.

02:49:00.240 --> 02:49:04.760
That was my rendition of Whitney.

02:49:04.760 --> 02:49:06.320
I've been moved Rob.

02:49:06.320 --> 02:49:10.320
I know. At least my stomach moved a little.

02:49:10.320 --> 02:49:14.320
Let's see...

02:49:14.320 --> 02:49:18.320
Somebody in the chat room wants to say, uh, what is Two Step exactly?

02:49:18.320 --> 02:49:22.320
What is Two Step exactly? Play some, uh...

02:49:22.320 --> 02:49:26.320
I would say, like, Jack and Mark get busy, kinda.

02:49:26.320 --> 02:49:30.320
You know what's the funny thing about Two Step?

02:49:30.320 --> 02:49:34.320
British people claim they're the only people who can make Two Step.

02:49:34.320 --> 02:49:38.240
can only make trip hop because we're just supposed to be being making down

02:49:38.240 --> 02:49:42.160
tempo because there's supposed to be a difference

02:49:43.520 --> 02:49:50.400
yeah all right skype line is still open if you want to give us a call we'll see

02:49:50.400 --> 02:49:55.720
if anybody wants to call oh well in the meantime we have another question vid

02:49:55.720 --> 02:50:00.920
palace says speaking of maim what is your favorite classic arcade konami

02:50:00.920 --> 02:50:05.720
game? Mine is the Simpsons. This is a good question. Super Konami World. We're all a

02:50:05.720 --> 02:50:09.840
bunch of Konami whores. Super Konami World. What's that one all about? It was a game where

02:50:09.840 --> 02:50:15.640
they took a bunch of other Konami games and made them into one game like these two people

02:50:15.640 --> 02:50:19.760
made it into the Konami universe or something. There were two of them. They were kind of

02:50:19.760 --> 02:50:26.360
fun. Alright. Now that I think about it, I think they came out on like the Sonic-Con

02:50:26.360 --> 02:50:34.080
too. Way back when. Uh, anybody else care to answer this one? Bud. Oh, I'm sorry. Yes,

02:50:34.080 --> 02:50:43.720
Jamie? Twinbee. Twinbee. Oh, okay. Bud. Stop standing on the cable. It's hazardous for

02:50:43.720 --> 02:50:47.960
us both. I can't stand the symptoms because I worked at a place that had it for two years

02:50:47.960 --> 02:50:54.500
and that's all I would hear every day. Was Bart and Lisa screaming. Like when they do

02:50:54.500 --> 02:50:56.500
that thing when they were running through it?

02:50:56.500 --> 02:50:57.500
Yes.

02:50:57.500 --> 02:50:58.500
Ahh!

02:50:58.500 --> 02:50:59.500
Ahh!

02:50:59.500 --> 02:51:00.500
And that's what it sounded like.

02:51:00.500 --> 02:51:01.500
Yes.

02:51:01.500 --> 02:51:02.500
It sounded like a screaming baby.

02:51:02.500 --> 02:51:03.500
Yes, when I worked him out in mics.

02:51:03.500 --> 02:51:05.560
Do they have any shoot-em-ups?

02:51:05.560 --> 02:51:11.320
My favorite classic, and then going back to classic classic Konami arcade game, motherfucking

02:51:11.320 --> 02:51:14.880
Time Pilot is my favorite classic arcade game by Konami.

02:51:14.880 --> 02:51:15.880
Time Pilot.

02:51:15.880 --> 02:51:18.280
Gradius, what was the second one, Life Force?

02:51:18.280 --> 02:51:19.280
Gradius...

02:51:19.280 --> 02:51:29.040
It was Life Force on the NES in America, but it was Salamander in the arcade in Japan.

02:51:29.040 --> 02:51:33.760
I didn't go to the arcade in Japan, I just played it on the NES, and yeah, Life Force

02:51:33.760 --> 02:51:34.760
is cool.

02:51:34.760 --> 02:51:35.760
Alrighty.

02:51:35.760 --> 02:51:36.760
No.

02:51:36.760 --> 02:51:41.240
I don't care if you're the motherfucking host.

02:51:41.240 --> 02:51:45.280
Ooh, bugged in Dark Sakura having a fight.

02:51:45.280 --> 02:51:49.120
But you're holding your hand like it's a gun.

02:51:49.120 --> 02:51:54.120
I'll give her my mic if you're not careful.

02:51:54.120 --> 02:52:01.120
Parodius. Actually, specifically, O'Shaubary Parodius.

02:52:01.120 --> 02:52:06.120
Garrett, I know you're a big Konami horror. What other Konami arcade game classic ones

02:52:06.120 --> 02:52:07.120
are your favorite?

02:52:07.120 --> 02:52:10.120
I didn't really... I mean, you know, I never really got to play a lot of arcade games when

02:52:10.120 --> 02:52:15.120
I was a kid. The ones I did play, I don't remember who made them. Yeah, it's kind of

02:52:15.120 --> 02:52:16.120
sad.

02:52:16.120 --> 02:52:18.120
And somebody did say Parodius.

02:52:18.120 --> 02:52:24.120
They, uh, just say, like, I don't know, what else is Konami? I'm trying to think of, like,

02:52:24.120 --> 02:52:25.120
the old-school Konami games.

02:52:25.120 --> 02:52:26.120
I could only think of...

02:52:26.120 --> 02:52:30.240
Uh, Track and Field. Just say Track and Field. I love Track and Field!

02:52:30.240 --> 02:52:33.040
I could only think of the damn Capcom fighting games.

02:52:33.040 --> 02:52:37.600
All right. They actually have a lot of games. Like, I think Konami was involved with Frogger

02:52:37.600 --> 02:52:43.000
at one point. But all I know is they didn't make Burger Time, so, sorry, guys.

02:52:43.000 --> 02:52:47.760
More questions from our chat room. EvilNauke2DX wants to know, he just said,

02:52:47.760 --> 02:52:51.680
I have a question. Oh, here it is. What is that game being played on the webcam right

02:52:51.680 --> 02:52:58.280
now with all the naked anime ladies? It's Gals Panic. It's simply just Gals Panic, not

02:52:58.280 --> 02:53:06.080
Gals Panic 95 or anything like that? Logie says Gals Panic Super S2 is the one he's playing

02:53:06.080 --> 02:53:11.720
right now. And it's beating his ass. He's on a really advanced stage at this point,

02:53:11.720 --> 02:53:22.080
isn't he? I don't know. We'll see. Alright. I guess at this point, it's almost time to

02:53:22.080 --> 02:53:25.640
kind of wrap up the show, but I was hoping that somebody would call in on the Skype line,

02:53:25.640 --> 02:53:36.160
but we didn't get anybody. Boo! Boo to that. Nobody has a question. I cry. I see how it

02:53:36.160 --> 02:53:43.440
is. All right. I'm trying to see how long the fortune cookie is tonight. I think it's

02:53:43.440 --> 02:53:49.880
a longer one. Yeah, it is. So we'll probably start to wrap up the show here since nobody's

02:53:49.880 --> 02:53:56.680
calling us on the Skype line. I guess let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

02:53:56.680 --> 02:54:00.200
I'm going to shut off the Skype line since nobody's using it. All right. Let's go around

02:54:00.200 --> 02:54:03.040
and get everybody's final thoughts. Thank you very much for those that participated

02:54:03.040 --> 02:54:10.040
in tonight's Ask Orange Lounge. Meanwhile, final thoughts time. Umm, Bud, final thought.

02:54:13.080 --> 02:54:18.080
Thank you, that was lovely. Final thought from Jonas.

02:54:18.080 --> 02:54:25.080
Sucks to be late. Are you here to plug anything tonight since you were late? Do you have anything

02:54:25.400 --> 02:54:30.380
you want to plug while you're here? Well, not really. That school's about to start soon

02:54:30.380 --> 02:54:37.380
in a stay fair. It's coming up soon. That's practically all.

02:54:39.580 --> 02:54:43.300
I thought maybe you had like an attorney or a sim file or something, but I wouldn't be

02:54:43.300 --> 02:54:45.340
playing school. Oh, well I do have, I'm supposed to release

02:54:45.340 --> 02:54:48.580
that for no revenge, the one that Loki was asking for me to do.

02:54:48.580 --> 02:54:50.140
Didn't somebody already do that? Yeah.

02:54:50.140 --> 02:54:56.080
Pimari Warrior, I've checked the sim file itself. It's not really that great to download

02:54:56.080 --> 02:55:00.980
If you're in- if it's- cuz the sympho that Pimani Williams made was a little too repetitive

02:55:00.980 --> 02:55:08.640
and inconsistent pattern-wise, cuz me and MJ are supposed to make the sympho by now,

02:55:08.640 --> 02:55:11.520
I'm not sure if Loki- Loki, didn't you say you wanted to do the background?

02:55:11.520 --> 02:55:14.120
No, you can do whatever you want.

02:55:14.120 --> 02:55:15.120
Okay.

02:55:15.120 --> 02:55:18.120
Okay, I guess I'll do it.

02:55:18.120 --> 02:55:19.120
Alright.

02:55:19.120 --> 02:55:20.120
Alright.

02:55:20.120 --> 02:55:23.440
Garrett, your final thought, thanks for coming tonight by the way, and bringing us pop and

02:55:23.440 --> 02:55:24.440
music stuff.

02:55:24.440 --> 02:55:25.440
What's your final thought?

02:55:25.440 --> 02:55:37.440
LOKI I WANT ANIMAL COOKIES AND THERE'S NONE LEFT

02:55:37.440 --> 02:55:51.440
CRUMS IRISH CAR BOMBS MAKE MY STOMACH SAD

02:55:51.440 --> 02:55:53.440
But they were very good.

02:55:53.440 --> 02:55:55.440
Jamie?

02:55:55.440 --> 02:55:59.440
My final thought is I'm going to go home and have some ice cream.

02:55:59.440 --> 02:56:02.440
Mmm, ice cream.

02:56:02.440 --> 02:56:04.440
Mmm, ice cream is good.

02:56:04.440 --> 02:56:07.440
Okay, uh, final word of the show tonight.

02:56:07.440 --> 02:56:09.440
Let's, um, I'm going to give it to Garrett.

02:56:09.440 --> 02:56:11.440
You can have the final word of tonight's show. What do you want to say?

02:56:11.440 --> 02:56:14.440
That's why I said home. I don't know.

02:56:14.440 --> 02:56:16.440
One word.

02:56:16.440 --> 02:56:26.200

02:58:02.320 --> 02:58:04.920
everybody who's quitting me y'all have that friend who's quitting it you know

02:58:04.920 --> 02:58:07.480
what I mean the guy's quitting everything I quit smoking I quit drugs I quit

02:58:07.480 --> 02:58:10.980
drink and I quit meeting out here. I get up in the morning with a nice big bowl of oat

02:58:10.980 --> 02:58:14.580
bran, I go to the bathroom for three and a half hours. I have another bowl of oat bran,

02:58:14.580 --> 02:58:19.380
I go back in the bathroom for six more hours, all I do is eat and shit, I'm gonna live forever.

02:58:19.380 --> 02:58:24.540
My colon is the strongest muscle in my body right now. I could pass Elvis through my colon

02:58:24.540 --> 02:58:31.600
right now. And all these cereals they have, crackling oat bran and horking fiber chunks,

02:58:31.600 --> 02:58:35.280
you know. Cereal used to come with free prizes, now it comes with a free roll of toilet paper

02:58:35.280 --> 02:58:38.920
in every box. Guys get up on Sunday morning, forget about the New York Times, I'm gonna

02:58:38.920 --> 02:58:43.280
need the Bible, I got a big one brewing here. Dad, there's a phone call, I'm on Genesis

02:58:43.280 --> 02:58:48.720
god damn it. You tell them the call back after the creation. People checking their own feces

02:58:48.720 --> 02:58:56.040
for fiber, you have too much free fucking time on your hands, okay? Red meat, white

02:58:56.040 --> 02:59:00.240
meat, blue meat, meat, oh fucking rama, you will eat it. Because not eating meat is a

02:59:00.240 --> 02:59:04.640
decision, eating meat is an instinct. Yeah, and I know what it's about. I don't want to

02:59:04.640 --> 02:59:10.080
to me because I love the animals. I love the animals. I love the animals too. I love my dog.

02:59:10.080 --> 02:59:16.160
He's so cute. He's so cute. There's the problem. We only want to save the cute animals, don't we?

02:59:16.160 --> 02:59:20.000
Yeah. Why don't we just have animal auditions? Line them up one by one and interview them

02:59:20.000 --> 02:59:24.480
individually. What are you? I'm an otter. And what do you do? I swim around on my back and do cute

02:59:24.480 --> 02:59:32.080
little human things with my hands. You're free to go. And what are you? I'm a cow. Get in the

02:59:32.080 --> 02:59:37.600

first stop Vietnam surprised the fuck out of those people huh you make a movie not this time pal

03:00:21.360 --> 03:00:28.160
Now, personally, I think Mama Cass said it best when she said,

03:00:28.160 --> 03:00:28.660
Ah!

03:00:28.660 --> 03:00:29.160
Ah!

03:00:43.660 --> 03:00:44.160
Ah!

03:00:44.160 --> 03:01:10.160
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

03:01:14.160 --> 03:01:26.000
The afterbirth, the part of the show that happens after the credits fade out, and we're

03:01:26.000 --> 03:01:30.560
back for our final epilogue. You know it's funny when that fortune cookie was playing,

03:01:30.560 --> 03:01:32.920
somebody in the chat room said, this is Jamie's doing, isn't it?

03:01:32.920 --> 03:01:36.240
I always pick the fortune cookie. Yeah, Jamie picks almost all of our fortune

03:01:36.240 --> 03:01:39.280
cookies. I think maybe like one time I got to pick one.

03:01:39.280 --> 03:01:42.080
I remember when we used to think of pre-recording them.

03:01:42.080 --> 03:01:47.000
Yeah, we used to. But this is more fun. But that was a long one! But Dennis Leary's cool,

03:01:47.000 --> 03:01:47.640
so it doesn't matter.

03:01:47.640 --> 03:01:48.920
I've played longer.

03:01:48.920 --> 03:01:50.280
I know. I know.

03:01:50.280 --> 03:01:52.360
Aww, it's naked with a horse.

03:01:52.360 --> 03:01:56.440
One of our Orange Lounge buddies wanted us to call them while we had a chance here over

03:01:56.440 --> 03:02:01.640
the Skype line, so I'm going to go ahead and give her a call here. Hopefully it'll work.

03:02:01.640 --> 03:02:04.640
Let's see if it works. I'm going to see if she answers.

03:02:04.640 --> 03:02:19.080
No problem with the remote sound device. Oh, that sucks. Well, I'll open up the Skype line

03:02:19.080 --> 03:02:24.000
for an after birth call if somebody wants to call us. We'll see. Otherwise, what are

03:02:24.000 --> 03:02:26.360
your big plans for this next week? Anything exciting?

03:02:26.360 --> 03:02:32.320
Well, I'm going to try to slack off as much as possible except for gym time.

03:02:32.320 --> 03:02:35.800
I need to work out this week really bad.

03:02:35.800 --> 03:02:39.120
I'm planning on going to the gym actually as much as I can

03:02:39.120 --> 03:02:42.720
during the next couple weeks because I'm gonna

03:02:42.720 --> 03:02:46.520
actually when I start school I'm gonna start running

03:02:46.520 --> 03:02:50.200
because I'll be at ARC Monday and Wednesday so I'll just go running

03:02:50.200 --> 03:02:53.800
or play DDR.

03:02:53.800 --> 03:02:58.080
I really should sign up for a gym because I think I'd actually maybe use a gym

03:02:58.080 --> 03:02:59.800
membership if I was paying for it.

03:02:59.800 --> 03:03:03.300
I signed up for my gym. You go to Family Fitness, right?

03:03:03.300 --> 03:03:06.300
Yep. That's the one I would probably sign up with. They're everywhere.

03:03:06.300 --> 03:03:10.940
Yeah, in this area, yeah. But, we'll see. The hotel I was at

03:03:10.940 --> 03:03:15.080
had a gym thing at it, but I was just too lazy to go.

03:03:15.080 --> 03:03:20.180
Working 10 hour days, I expect you to be worn out. But I also, I didn't bring any

03:03:20.180 --> 03:03:25.380
like shirts, or you know, like white plain shirts or anything that I could have

03:03:25.380 --> 03:03:28.500
You know what? I pack very light. You know what? You should get an

03:03:28.500 --> 03:03:31.540
eight-pound arm weights, hand weights.

03:03:31.540 --> 03:03:35.640
And just wear them around me today? Take them with you when you travel.

03:03:35.640 --> 03:03:39.300
That's not a bad idea. That's what I did when I went to E3. I had my weights with me.

03:03:39.300 --> 03:03:40.780
Okay.

03:03:40.780 --> 03:03:42.900
I hope we get to go to E3 again next year.

03:03:42.900 --> 03:03:44.380
That would be blissful.

03:03:44.380 --> 03:03:45.140
We'll get to go.

03:03:45.140 --> 03:03:47.020
I'll be there.

03:03:47.020 --> 03:03:50.340
Alright, we're getting a call. Hooray!

03:03:50.340 --> 03:03:53.940
You are on Orange Lounge Radio after birth.

03:03:53.940 --> 03:03:57.380
I joined a gym.

03:03:57.380 --> 03:03:59.380
Why? Are they calling me fat?

03:03:59.380 --> 03:04:01.380
No, I'm messing with you, man.

03:04:01.380 --> 03:04:07.380
No, it's a good thing to join a gym, but at the same time, your first week you're going to be in pain.

03:04:07.380 --> 03:04:09.380
I know. I've kind of worked out before.

03:04:09.380 --> 03:04:10.380
Oh my God.

03:04:10.380 --> 03:04:12.380
Couldn't I just play DDR?

03:04:12.380 --> 03:04:16.380
Well, no, start off on the cardio, seriously. It's the easiest thing to start with.

03:04:16.380 --> 03:04:24.380
And then, but the weight training, the first night I did weight training, I could not move my arms for like five days.

03:04:24.380 --> 03:04:25.380
I was so sore.

03:04:25.380 --> 03:04:26.380
Yeah.

03:04:26.380 --> 03:04:31.380
I want to join one that has a big pool so I can swim because I think swimming is a great exercise.

03:04:31.380 --> 03:04:34.380
You need to come to spin with me.

03:04:34.380 --> 03:04:36.380
Didn't you say that spin kicks your ass?

03:04:36.380 --> 03:04:39.380
It did the first couple times, but they let you take it easy the first time around.

03:04:39.380 --> 03:04:40.380
We'll see.

03:04:40.380 --> 03:04:41.380
Sure, Jamie. Yeah, they do.

03:04:41.380 --> 03:04:43.380
Do you go to a gym?

03:04:43.380 --> 03:04:46.380
Yeah, I do. I briefly joined one about a week ago.

03:04:46.380 --> 03:04:50.380
And has it been effective? Do you have washboard abs and muscles now?

03:04:50.380 --> 03:04:52.380
Too early to say.

03:04:52.380 --> 03:04:54.380
Pretty soon. Soon though, right?

03:04:54.380 --> 03:04:55.340
Is it you?

03:04:55.340 --> 03:04:55.820
Two of us?

03:04:55.820 --> 03:04:58.300
Yeah.

03:04:58.300 --> 03:04:59.300
Soon enough.

03:04:59.300 --> 03:05:00.000
All right.

03:05:00.000 --> 03:05:02.420
Well, I needed that, so thank you for yelling at me.

03:05:02.420 --> 03:05:03.460
I needed it.

03:05:03.460 --> 03:05:04.060
No problem, man.

03:05:04.060 --> 03:05:04.540
Later.

03:05:04.540 --> 03:05:05.100
All right, later.

03:05:07.580 --> 03:05:08.080
All right.

03:05:08.080 --> 03:05:10.020
That's going to do it for tonight's Afterbirth.

03:05:10.020 --> 03:05:12.460
Thank you guys for tuning in, supporting Orange Lawns Radio.

03:05:12.460 --> 03:05:13.720
Tomorrow night, Diversion.

03:05:13.720 --> 03:05:15.500
Don't forget, we're doing a little bit of a schedule switch.

03:05:15.500 --> 03:05:16.660
It's going to be permanent.

03:05:16.660 --> 03:05:19.000
Diversion will now be on Monday nights to accommodate

03:05:19.000 --> 03:05:20.200
Jamie going back to school.

03:05:20.200 --> 03:05:23.140
She will be doing Pump Up the Volume on Tuesday night,

03:05:23.140 --> 03:05:27.460
so definitely tune in. And then Wednesday nights, who knows what will happen soon.

03:05:27.460 --> 03:05:30.980
People have to put up with me bitching about school now, because I'm having to take

03:05:30.980 --> 03:05:34.580
my, the classes that I'm actually taking in a classroom are Business Law,

03:05:34.580 --> 03:05:38.260
which is my Monday Wednesday class, which is going to suck ass.

03:05:38.260 --> 03:05:42.100
And my other class is going to be Intro to Windows

03:05:42.100 --> 03:05:46.660
on Saturday, because I can't test out of it, because I don't have time to make it to the damn test.

03:05:46.660 --> 03:05:49.860
You don't have the days off. So you're going to be stuck

03:05:49.860 --> 03:05:53.060
doing it for a whole semester? Half semester.

03:05:53.060 --> 03:05:57.060
Which is one good thing. It's half semester. And I'm thinking about

03:05:57.080 --> 03:06:01.080
telling my teacher, excuse me, I know all this shit.

03:06:01.100 --> 03:06:05.100
Can't you challenge the course? Well, I can. I can test out of it.

03:06:05.120 --> 03:06:09.120
Oh, same thing. But I figure it's very useful to be easy A and get me started.

03:06:09.140 --> 03:06:13.140
I guess that's a true point. It's on a Saturday though, so I can, since I'll have my laptop

03:06:13.160 --> 03:06:17.160
I'll just play on the internet during class. Play Ragnarok or something.

03:06:17.180 --> 03:06:21.180
Seriously? Good idea.

03:06:21.180 --> 03:06:23.940
Yeah, I'll see what his attendance policy is, and I'll skip most of them.

03:06:23.940 --> 03:06:24.940
Alright.

03:06:24.940 --> 03:06:28.500
How's that for a good attitude to take going in a pool?

03:06:28.500 --> 03:06:29.500
I'm going home.

03:06:29.500 --> 03:06:30.500
Alright.

03:06:30.500 --> 03:06:31.500
Bye.

03:06:31.500 --> 03:06:32.500
Bye.

03:06:32.500 --> 03:06:43.780
Now, I would like to pass on my warm wishes to our listeners from the depths of my, excuse

03:06:43.780 --> 03:06:45.780
me, heart.

03:06:45.780 --> 03:06:49.940
Alright, um, I guess we'll go into our post-show now.

03:06:49.940 --> 03:06:56.020
I'm gonna play the pop and 11 soundtrack just kind of I randomized it all so you'll just hear a big clusterfuck of everything

03:06:56.020 --> 03:06:58.380
From pop music 11. That's a clusterfuck

03:06:59.420 --> 03:07:02.980
But first I wanted to play this song in case

03:07:03.560 --> 03:07:07.040
My friend is listening and hopefully he is and he knows who he is

03:07:08.220 --> 03:07:10.220
Mr. Bandicoot if you listening

03:07:10.540 --> 03:07:14.500
Here's a song that I know you wanted to hear and then after this song from my Castlevania

03:07:14.500 --> 03:07:19.500
It'll go into Papa Music 11. So enjoy and thanks for listening and tuning into Orange Andrea everybody. Good night
