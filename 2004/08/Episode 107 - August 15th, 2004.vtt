WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:22.000
And now for our feature presentation.

00:22.000 --> 00:26.320
Orange Lounge Radio Live is now on the air.

00:26.320 --> 00:33.320
Orange Lounge Radio Live is a live talk program dedicated to all things Bomani, and Bensum.

00:33.920 --> 00:39.920
Orange Lounge Radio may contain adult content, so you probably shouldn't let your children listen.

00:39.920 --> 00:46.920
If you do let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio, they may turn into evil little

00:48.020 --> 00:50.320
demons from hell!

00:50.320 --> 00:55.320
Oh wait, most children already are evil little demons from hell.

00:55.320 --> 01:04.320
Now you've seen that evil will always triumph, because good is dumb.

01:04.320 --> 01:07.320
Fact, drunk and stupid is no way to go through life, son.

01:07.320 --> 01:11.320
He jeopardizes my ability to effectively govern this student body.

01:11.320 --> 01:14.320
Well, makes you look like an ass, is what he does, Ed.

01:14.320 --> 01:18.320
Hamburgers! The cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast.

01:18.320 --> 01:21.320
That was huge. Cool.

01:21.320 --> 01:26.320
Do you mind if I take my new car for a ride?

01:26.320 --> 01:30.320
Catherine, the only thing you're gonna be riding is me.

01:30.320 --> 01:31.320
Have you seen Malcolm?

01:31.320 --> 01:32.320
Lena?

01:32.320 --> 01:36.320
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to my underground lair.

01:36.320 --> 01:39.320
So it was you. I was going to expose you.

01:39.320 --> 01:41.320
I know. So I choose to expose myself.

01:41.320 --> 01:43.320
Please, there are ladies present.

01:43.320 --> 01:45.320
This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.

01:45.320 --> 01:47.320
Dark Sakura.

01:47.320 --> 01:49.320
Oh my god, I see a bloody stump!

01:49.320 --> 01:50.320
Skye.

01:50.320 --> 02:09.440
We are live and this is episode number 107 for this, August the 15th of 2004.

02:09.440 --> 02:15.280
You're tuned in to the B-Money Scene's most unexciting radio station of all things B-Money.

02:15.280 --> 02:21.840
My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.

02:21.840 --> 02:25.960
Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts in this corner, the happiest bunny on the

02:25.960 --> 02:28.040
farm, Ms. Jamie Summers.

02:28.040 --> 02:29.520
You know her better as Dark Saffron.

02:29.520 --> 02:34.160
That was very anti-climactic, your little bee.

02:34.160 --> 02:35.160
I know.

02:35.160 --> 02:38.000
But we're old.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
We're old?

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
I know.

02:40.000 --> 02:46.000
You realize, you, me, Loki, we're about five years older than the Balmani average, right?

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
If not, maybe ten.

02:48.000 --> 02:53.000
We, we, I don't know if our show's ready for retirement or the nursing home or something.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
We're still kicking.

02:55.000 --> 03:00.000
I'm gonna turn our mics up just a tad. Do not adjust your volume on your own. Okay, we're up a little bit.

03:00.000 --> 03:05.000
Um, what was I gonna say? Oh, you're ready to quit doing this show already?

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
No.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
Oh, okay.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
I think you have to bring your hate to the master.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
I'm going to quit for like five seconds. I quit.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
Jamie! Jamie!

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
Okay, I don't quit anymore.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
Okay, good.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
Funny enough, that's not the first time she's threatened to quit the show.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
When have I ever?

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
Ah, you know, I'm kidding.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
Alright.

03:25.000 --> 03:31.000
Also joining us is our third co-host, our third wheel, the tech master, Loki!

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
Hi! The mic is quite loud today!

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
Okay, that means you do not scream in it, you just talk like normal, there you go.

03:40.000 --> 03:45.000
You got a loud voice, you got a loud man voice, you can take it away from your mouth a little.

03:45.000 --> 03:50.000
The whole show is going to be like, oh I'm level.

03:50.000 --> 03:55.000
How are you doing?

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
You going to go?

03:57.000 --> 04:02.000
Alright, also joining us tonight, we have some very special guests.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
have somebody who hasn't been here in a few weeks he's always kind of here he's

04:05.000 --> 04:07.880
like our mascot I think he's kind of like a mascot because he's here he

04:07.880 --> 04:10.780
doesn't talk a whole lot but neither does the guy in the chicken suit at the

04:10.780 --> 04:16.940
football game so I'm dubbing him our mascot it's Arcadian 42 yeah I had gas

04:16.940 --> 04:24.780
today oops I'm in my car again yesterday can I get a go team go go stop stop

04:24.780 --> 04:35.880
don't go anymore. Go, go, go, go. And where have you been, young man? In my apartment.

04:35.880 --> 04:42.460
You missed a big show last week. Yeah, I didn't have a guest last week. We actually had like

04:42.460 --> 04:46.720
a big show last week. I'm actually afraid to see how many people come back because last

04:46.720 --> 04:52.760
week our show was dominated by this song, I don't know, this cure-ed song that I guess

04:52.760 --> 04:56.320
was big or something. We had to play and there was tons of people here, so I'm kind of curious

04:56.320 --> 05:01.080
how many actually come back to hear what the real train wreck sounds like tonight. Because

05:01.080 --> 05:14.900
on tonight's platter, you guys, absolutely nothing! Alright. Alright. Anyway, also with

05:14.900 --> 05:22.480
us tonight, the lovely DDR Angel is back this week. Hello! I have cheesed it. Yeah.

05:22.480 --> 05:24.480
Czestas, what kind?

05:24.480 --> 05:26.480
Uh, chugger and jack, I don't ask.

05:27.480 --> 05:30.480
Alright, we'll be talking to all our guests a little bit more later.

05:30.480 --> 05:36.480
We're going to definitely play some How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day when we come back, and then I suppose we're going to do some Bamani news too, we should take care of.

05:36.480 --> 05:39.480
Attention John Field, my name is not Jammie.

05:42.480 --> 05:44.480
Thank you, 1M please.

05:44.480 --> 05:49.480
Jamie will scold you if you want to join our chat room www.orangelaungeradio.com

05:49.480 --> 05:54.480
Click on chat and be paraded by the lovely dark chakra.

05:54.480 --> 05:59.480
Alright, in this break I thought we could do some booty-riffic music from DDR Solo 2000

05:59.480 --> 06:04.480
Cause I wanted to hear I'm Alive. We'll do some Don't Clock Me and maybe some Captain Jack too in this break.

06:04.480 --> 06:11.480
in this break. So we'll be back in a little bit with Orange Lounge Radio.

06:34.480 --> 06:38.480
Baby, I'm alive, yeah, yeah

06:39.480 --> 06:40.480
I love you, baby

06:40.480 --> 06:42.480
The feelings all around me

06:42.480 --> 06:45.480
I want you, baby, all night long

06:46.480 --> 06:47.480
We're together

06:47.480 --> 06:49.480
The dream has no ending

06:49.480 --> 06:52.480
Let's come together and sing our song

06:53.480 --> 06:56.480
I can't say I love you, love you

06:56.480 --> 07:00.480
I wanna love you, love you

07:00.480 --> 07:03.480
I can't say I love you

07:03.480 --> 07:05.480
I feel

07:07.100 --> 07:12.700
But I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive, baby I'm alive

07:12.960 --> 07:13.960
Yeah baby

07:14.260 --> 07:20.680
Yes I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive, baby I'm alive

07:21.780 --> 07:23.520
I'm alive, I'm alive

07:23.520 --> 07:27.000
I'm alive, baby I'm alive

07:27.000 --> 07:36.000
Cause I'm a-la-la-la-la-alive Baby, I'm alive, a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a

07:39.000 --> 07:45.000
Come on, baby Let's dream a dream together

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
A dream that is real

07:51.000 --> 07:55.000
Don't die, don't die Don't die, don't die

08:55.000 --> 08:58.500
It's the only way you'll be before you're making me free

08:58.500 --> 09:01.500
Ooh, la-da-dee, la-da-da

09:31.500 --> 09:35.500
Don't try to stop me, don't wait up and go

09:35.500 --> 09:39.000
Don't watch me, don't be, don't watch me

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
Don't try to stop me, don't wait up and go

09:43.000 --> 09:44.500
Don't watch me

09:44.500 --> 09:46.000
Crockin' like a nut, crackin' crust is a nut

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
This is a vice for my rifle when I'm on the cut

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
After end, you memorialize the state of your birth

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Back then you're like Gatorade when I'm quitchin' my serve

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
I'm the fashionist at the end, you're the fable

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
I touch it like my duty, just a record on the table

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
I'm on a fox, get off the battleground

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
You're no master for the gods, I could beat you down

10:00.000 --> 10:15.720
Just rock me, don't try to stop me Don't wait up and, yo

10:15.720 --> 10:22.720
Just clap for me, don't try to stop me Don't wait up and yell, don't clap me to

10:22.720 --> 10:28.720
beat Just clap for me, don't try to stop me, yo

10:28.720 --> 10:30.720
Don't try to fly me!

10:58.720 --> 11:00.720
Bye-bye, baby.

11:28.720 --> 11:29.720
Yeah, two cents, yeah.

11:29.720 --> 11:31.720
Give us money.

11:31.720 --> 11:32.720
Give me money.

11:32.720 --> 11:36.800
Actually, I'm thinking about, I'm thinking about putting a poll on the website next week.

11:36.800 --> 11:40.300
You should go to our website and always take the poll and take old polls too, because polls

11:40.300 --> 11:41.300
are important.

11:41.300 --> 11:45.420
But remember, when you're done taking them, give them back.

11:45.420 --> 11:46.560
What is this week's poll anyway?

11:46.560 --> 11:47.560
I forget.

11:47.560 --> 11:48.560
Over on orangeontario.com.

11:48.560 --> 11:49.560
I think it has something to do with Xbox.

11:49.560 --> 11:54.320
I think it was about that quad mode, which we'll talk about later, that quad mode on

11:54.320 --> 11:55.320
UltraMix.

11:55.320 --> 11:56.320
Yeah.

11:56.320 --> 11:58.160
I want to know what you guys think about quad mode on UltraMix too.

11:58.160 --> 12:02.000
talk about this later. We gotta go vote in our poll on orangeloungerator.com. There will

12:02.000 --> 12:08.280
be a poll coming up soon about who wants to buy an orange lounge t-shirt, because I happen

12:08.280 --> 12:12.720
to have a friend at work who has a friend that owns a t-shirt business, who can get

12:12.720 --> 12:17.000
us some deals on t-shirts. I'm thinking about doing a little money making for the show,

12:17.000 --> 12:21.520
so especially if we're going to have to raise that cap thanks to last week's show, so we'll

12:21.520 --> 12:25.880
see. Nobody's locked out of the stream tonight though. Plenty of spots still available if

12:25.880 --> 12:30.760
you have a friend who wants to listen to the show. Definitely. And if they don't want to

12:30.760 --> 12:36.000
make them. That's right. And certainly, you know, there's all these past polls on the

12:36.000 --> 12:39.680
site too that you can still go take. Then we'll see who wants a shirt. The polls are

12:39.680 --> 12:46.320
fun. Yeah, the polls are fun. They're interesting. They are. In a poll-like way. Yeah. Not a

12:46.320 --> 12:50.360
whole lot of sites that do DDR polling out there. I mean, of course there's DDR Freak,

12:50.360 --> 12:55.240
but unfortunately we only get one new poll a month there. And who else does polls on

12:55.240 --> 12:58.400
their site. I can't think of any. There's a few other, but they're not really

12:58.400 --> 13:02.720
Bemani related. They're not us. That's the important thing. Yeah, they're not us.

13:02.720 --> 13:09.720
So go support the Orange Laundrio poll. Of course, tonight, lots to talk about in

13:09.720 --> 13:13.500
the Bemani world. I think what we're going to do tonight, because last week was kind

13:13.500 --> 13:19.360
of dominated by Segerd being here among our other guests. Segerd might be back, by the

13:19.360 --> 13:21.400
way. Segerd... He was cool. He should come back.

13:21.400 --> 13:24.960
I don't know. Well, I mean, of course, he's been a longtime guest of the show. It's just

13:24.960 --> 13:29.240
now people care who he is because he works for Konami, but... We always care about him.

13:29.240 --> 13:33.280
We always loved him. We knew Seagurd when he was underground, okay? Yeah, we knew him

13:33.280 --> 13:38.120
back in the days of his old nickname. We listened to him when he was underground. We saw him

13:38.120 --> 13:43.920
dunk. Well, here's the thing is that the weekend he comes back, I don't know if I should say

13:43.920 --> 13:48.160
what weekend he might come back, because it depends on work. Because, you know, they work

13:48.160 --> 13:50.960
those Konami employees. Is this the weekend I'm thinking it is? It's the weekend that

13:50.960 --> 13:53.920
Jamie might be going camping. Let me put it this way, it's the next weekend we're probably

13:53.920 --> 14:00.920
going to do a dunk show? What would that be? When I'm going camping. Oh, you suck! Alright,

14:00.920 --> 14:06.120
alright, we'll see, we'll see. I want to go... In two weeks we're doing a drug show, or at

14:06.120 --> 14:12.680
least I'm doing a drug show. Do you have Monday offers? No, I'll take Monday off on my birthday

14:12.680 --> 14:19.760
weekend. Oh, okay. Jamie will do... To celebrate the crashing of planes. If I'm here, I'll

14:19.760 --> 14:24.120
I'll do a shot of tequila, but I'm not going to drink like I did last time.

14:24.120 --> 14:25.680
You know how I drank last time.

14:25.680 --> 14:26.680
Yeah.

14:26.680 --> 14:27.680
Oh, yeah.

14:27.680 --> 14:28.680
Oh, yeah.

14:28.680 --> 14:29.680
I remember that.

14:29.680 --> 14:35.400
Tequila is not low carb.

14:35.400 --> 14:38.200
So we'll have Seagrid back in a few weeks.

14:38.200 --> 14:41.300
But since last week was kind of dominated by him being here, not only that, but us teasing

14:41.300 --> 14:46.240
everybody with the Urine thing, and then we also had Pirate Power was here, and who else

14:46.240 --> 14:47.240
was here?

14:47.240 --> 14:48.820
Angel was here, and Anita.

14:48.820 --> 14:54.380
So we kind of pushed all the Maimani news aside, except for the Uran thing, and hints.

14:54.380 --> 14:56.920
The running gag last week was that everything was a hint.

14:56.920 --> 15:00.480
So now we're actually going to go back and talk about some of the Maimani news from last

15:00.480 --> 15:02.620
week and this week, because there's been a lot in the past two weeks.

15:02.620 --> 15:03.620
A lot of Maimanias.

15:03.620 --> 15:05.620
I did notice, though, general consensus.

15:05.620 --> 15:08.740
I think a lot of people like the original better.

15:08.740 --> 15:09.740
I don't.

15:09.740 --> 15:10.740
I prefer the remix.

15:10.740 --> 15:11.740
I do prefer the remix.

15:11.740 --> 15:12.860
Did I have to say I like the original better?

15:12.860 --> 15:15.740
I think it's certainly better suited for DDR.

15:15.740 --> 15:18.440
Well, yeah, for DDR, but I mean as a song.

15:18.440 --> 15:22.320
I think I like, I think it would just depend on the mood I'm in. Like, I think the original

15:22.320 --> 15:26.280
works better in the scope of a Silent Hill soundtrack, but the new one works better for

15:26.280 --> 15:28.440
a Dancy soundtrack, so. Well, true.

15:28.440 --> 15:31.720
We'll play it, we'll play it again tonight, because I know some people may have missed

15:31.720 --> 15:34.480
it last week, so we'll play it again tonight at some point. We won't make it wait two hours

15:34.480 --> 15:38.240
this time, we'll play it soon. But I'll have some other songs we have to play too, because

15:38.240 --> 15:41.440
you know, they announced a bunch of stuff for Ultra Mix, and some of you guys, even

15:41.440 --> 15:44.840
though they're from 2DX, you haven't heard it before, so we definitely want to make sure

15:44.840 --> 15:47.200
you hear this before the game comes out. Oh, Rob.

15:47.200 --> 15:50.200
What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What?

15:50.200 --> 15:55.200
I'm just getting out of the way early.

15:55.200 --> 15:59.200
Damn it. My prop isn't working. My baby won't work for you.

15:59.200 --> 16:04.200
My prop isn't working. Oh shit. All my work is about to fall off the table.

16:04.200 --> 16:09.200
Throw me the baby. Hold on. Hold on.

16:09.200 --> 16:13.200
Whee! Babies. Alright. Anyway.

16:13.200 --> 16:17.040
Moving on, we've got to get this out of the way though because this is how we start off

16:17.040 --> 16:18.040
every show.

16:18.040 --> 16:22.320
We have to talk a little bit about how was your week, how was your day, and starting

16:22.320 --> 16:26.160
us off as always the lovely Dark Sakura is going to say how her week was and how her

16:26.160 --> 16:28.160
day was.

16:28.160 --> 16:35.480
My week was pretty dull, yeah it was just work, except that I started class on Wednesday.

16:35.480 --> 16:40.560
I had my first orientation for one of my online classes and I took another orientation on

16:40.560 --> 16:43.720
Saturday and dropped some really retarded class that

16:43.720 --> 16:48.400
they're making me take, which was Intro to Windows.

16:48.400 --> 16:50.200
When I found out what the last course was, I

16:50.200 --> 16:51.400
dropped it so fast.

16:51.400 --> 16:56.480
The last assignment in that class, Rob, is how to rename

16:56.480 --> 16:58.320
and move files.

16:58.320 --> 17:00.160
Wow, that sounds difficult.

17:00.160 --> 17:02.720
That sounds really stupid.

17:02.720 --> 17:05.440
I know five-year-olds that can rename files, OK?

17:05.440 --> 17:09.960
So I dropped the class, and I'm going to

17:09.960 --> 17:13.520
petition the dean next quarter uh... next semester to let me uh... test out

17:13.520 --> 17:16.000
of it

17:16.000 --> 17:18.100
i could do that with mike

17:18.100 --> 17:20.560
you know windows three point one

17:20.560 --> 17:24.120
way back when

17:24.120 --> 17:26.120
i could rename files and dot

17:26.120 --> 17:28.600
who

17:28.600 --> 17:29.800
so yeah

17:29.800 --> 17:33.000
you remember i would remember who were using windows back when it was

17:33.000 --> 17:34.120
underground

17:34.120 --> 17:37.960
asher way back back when this little you know

17:37.960 --> 17:41.640
kid and college thought he was brilliant and was going to make a different operating system.

17:41.640 --> 17:48.400
Back when they were an indie band, you were using Windows.

17:48.400 --> 17:51.560
But I'm going to, there's a bunch of classes I'm going to test out of because they're really

17:51.560 --> 17:55.560
stupid.

17:55.560 --> 18:07.040
And I'm also planning on going back to finish, I'm thinking about double majoring, so I'm

18:07.040 --> 18:12.820
still sort of considering that but it's just been work school stuff a little bit

18:12.820 --> 18:19.120
of a personal drama in my life not nothing major I've I've been kind of

18:19.120 --> 18:24.320
stressed out so but I'm working on trying to stay positive trying to stay

18:24.320 --> 18:33.280
happy trying to you know not erupt into random bouts of bitchiness over things

18:33.280 --> 18:45.480
beyond my control I have a song to dedicate to you Jamie no why cuz it's no

18:45.480 --> 18:50.320
more drama haven't you heard this song yeah it's from one of the stupid soap

18:50.320 --> 18:54.840
operas well it's actually raps on the sample so hold on hold on let it kick in

18:54.840 --> 19:03.160
here that is desperation okay that's almost as bad as when the Fuji's ripped

19:03.160 --> 19:10.160
that Enya song. Okay? That's really, really bad. Really bad.

19:11.500 --> 19:17.500
This definitely should be in DDR. I know a lot of people that could use that song.

19:17.500 --> 19:24.500
Yeah, I don't think that there's anything really all that major that happened in my

19:24.500 --> 19:31.220
I don't think that there's anything really all that major that happened in my week. Nothing of notable circumstance, so

19:32.020 --> 19:34.980
Well, aren't you boring? I'm just kidding. Well, bite me

19:35.980 --> 19:42.500
I'm just teasing you. You know, boring. It occurs since there was a curse that says may you live in interesting times

19:45.780 --> 19:51.300
Interesting. There's also another one that says may the fleas of a thousand camels rest in your genitals, but I don't go through that one

19:51.300 --> 19:54.420
I'm gonna pass on the mic.

19:54.420 --> 19:59.160
Alright, moving on. Let's talk to DDR Angel and see how her week and her day was.

19:59.160 --> 20:03.060
Angel. Hi, um, oh jeez.

20:03.060 --> 20:06.620
Okay, here, hold on. Oh, Jamie wants to say one more thing. I broke Dan's main cabinet.

20:06.620 --> 20:10.820
How'd you break it? Actually, I pulled the joystick thing loose from the thing

20:10.820 --> 20:14.980
with my, uh... You pulled the thing from the thing? The joystick mechanism.

20:14.980 --> 20:18.820
I pulled it, it's attached underneath the panel, and I pulled it loose

20:18.820 --> 20:20.820
So it sunk into the panel.

20:20.820 --> 20:26.820
Because his machine could not withstand my mad Street Fighter Alpha 2 prowess.

20:26.820 --> 20:28.820
I see.

20:28.820 --> 20:30.820
Anyway, hi.

20:30.820 --> 20:32.820
Hi Angel, how was your week? How was your day?

20:32.820 --> 20:36.820
Pretty good. Just been working and stuff.

20:36.820 --> 20:40.820
I signed up for classes yesterday.

20:40.820 --> 20:46.820
So, oh my god, we're all going to meet in the cafeteria and be like lunchtime high school crap.

20:46.820 --> 20:50.820
Yeah, I guess so. Here, wait, let the, let the ferret talk for a second.

20:50.820 --> 20:55.820
See, he likes it too.

20:55.820 --> 20:56.820
Okay.

20:56.820 --> 20:59.820
I still want to set the ferrets on fire.

20:59.820 --> 21:02.820
No! No! Anyway, um, yeah, so...

21:02.820 --> 21:04.820
Maybe for Halloween.

21:04.820 --> 21:07.820
Just work, and gonna be school soon, and...

21:07.820 --> 21:11.820
I don't know, my life's pretty boring now that I'm up here.

21:11.820 --> 21:15.820
But it's okay, I guess.

21:15.820 --> 21:20.820
How has your last five weeks been?

21:45.820 --> 21:47.820
Right on. That'd be good.

21:48.820 --> 21:50.820
Which is nice.

21:51.820 --> 21:54.820
Like, in a few months I get more money, so that would be good.

21:55.820 --> 21:58.820
And not sitting at home all day every day like I usually do.

21:58.820 --> 22:02.820
Just go out to the stores and not play anything else.

22:02.820 --> 22:06.820
Uh, I haven't played any Bimani in, like, a long time.

22:06.820 --> 22:12.820
And because, uh, data entry all day doesn't really mess very well with the Beatmania.

22:12.820 --> 22:19.820
the only thing I have at home that I can play anymore because I sold everything else.

22:19.820 --> 22:25.820
Okay, and that's about all. Today I just sat around, watched a little bit of something

22:25.820 --> 22:30.820
on tape that I taped a long time ago that I wanted to watch again, and then played on

22:30.820 --> 22:34.820
play on the computer, and, came here!

22:34.820 --> 22:37.820
Exciting.

22:37.820 --> 22:39.820
Alright.

22:39.820 --> 22:41.820
Loki!

22:41.820 --> 22:44.820
Hey buddy, how was your week, how was your day?

22:44.820 --> 22:48.820
Uh, I didn't do anything, just played Final Fantasy, and uh,

22:48.820 --> 22:53.820
I was working on my cabinet because I got the new thing to fix it so there's no lag,

22:53.820 --> 22:57.820
but, um, that didn't work too well so I need to rewire the whole damn thing,

22:57.820 --> 23:03.820
Which will, in the end, be better anyways, because it's a real mess as far as wires go.

23:03.820 --> 23:12.820
And, um, I don't know. Just, like, sitting there at work and reading the internet, that's pretty much all I do.

23:12.820 --> 23:18.820
Nothing interesting, I'm afraid. Damn, that would suck.

23:18.820 --> 23:24.820
Yeah, so what's up? Wow, am I the only one that actually tried to go play some DDR this week?

23:24.820 --> 23:52.820
Which is what? I played step mania. I don't know if step mania counts. Step mania is not DDR. It is not DDR. No, that's a message to everybody. Step mania is not DDR. If you triple A something in step mania, it doesn't mean shit. Okay? Why? Why does it mean shit? Because I said so. Because it's not the same thing. Using your fingers and using your feet are two different things. But you're playing on a pad. If you're playing on a pad, it still doesn't count because step mania is not DDR and it's different timing.

23:52.820 --> 23:58.500
You can actually make the timing exact so what do you have to say about that? I think it's a load of crap

23:58.500 --> 24:01.780
It's still not DDR and you can buy me. So how was your week? Oh my week?

24:03.860 --> 24:08.900
My week I spent making fun of Statmania people who say it's DDR. No. Ah continuation

24:12.380 --> 24:16.100
I forgot to mention because I'm sure Rob want to talk about this anyways

24:16.100 --> 24:25.100
The other thing I was doing this week is researching interdimensional communication and yeah, I'm going to build a device.

24:25.100 --> 24:37.100
Let me say that again for those that didn't catch it. Loki is studying interdimensional communication and he's going to build a device. What kind of device?

24:37.100 --> 24:38.100
He's ripping in a portal to hell.

24:38.100 --> 24:39.380
a germane

24:39.380 --> 24:40.580
no it's a germane

24:40.580 --> 24:44.420
no it's not a pearl to hell god damn it that's the same thing i said

24:44.420 --> 24:48.700
i said he's building a vortex to hell is what he's making right now

24:48.700 --> 24:51.980
this show is a vortex to hell

24:51.980 --> 24:55.820
i am i'm basically uh...

24:55.820 --> 25:00.020
recreating an experiment done by some guy who is now dead

25:00.020 --> 25:01.420
and we know why

25:01.420 --> 25:04.420
okay anyways

25:04.420 --> 25:06.520
it's basically it's uh... it's

25:06.520 --> 25:11.640
called a germanium communicator. The reason why it's called a germanium communicator is

25:11.640 --> 25:17.360
because isn't a germanium what you keep gerbils in? It's a plant. You're trying to talk to

25:17.360 --> 25:26.440
plants. No, I'm not germanium. People at my work do that. Germanium. Like german with

25:26.440 --> 25:33.280
an i-u-m. Isn't that an element? Exactly. That's what it is. It's an element. It's like

25:33.280 --> 25:39.020
one of the- Number 37 on the periodical chart, it has the same comp- or the same compounds

25:39.020 --> 25:47.300
as, uh, silicon almost. You can make boobs out of it! Silicon, not silicone! God! Adding

25:47.300 --> 25:53.400
letters to my stuff. Anyways, no, so I'm gonna buy- I'm buying an in-go of this stuff off

25:53.400 --> 25:57.860
the internet since they don't really, you know, sell- which you can make by synthesizing

25:57.860 --> 26:03.380
for the ore plus a fire crystal. Just for the record. And you say, I'm a Final Fantasy

26:03.380 --> 26:09.980
addict. God. So I'm buying an Ingo of this stuff. Basically what it does is you use that,

26:09.980 --> 26:14.580
you put pressure on it with some sort of screw that makes a focal point or whatever. Then

26:14.580 --> 26:19.780
you wire that to two coils and run that to, you know, your stereo in jack. And you're

26:19.780 --> 26:25.540
supposed to be able to then record the dead or the, you know, people on another dimension.

26:25.540 --> 26:31.540
Anyways, this is an experiment. It did work, like, about ten years ago, so I don't see why it wouldn't work now.

26:31.540 --> 26:36.540
I know everyone thinks I'm crazy, but I'm gonna laugh at you when it works. I'm gonna laugh at you.

26:36.540 --> 26:39.540
How do you know if they're dead? What if they're really demons?

26:39.540 --> 26:43.540
Well, here's the thing. What if you're picking up, like, a baby monitor upstairs or something?

26:43.540 --> 26:46.540
I hear something noise.

26:46.540 --> 26:53.540
Well, that's funny you should mention that, because this in no way can pick up radio waves or, you know, any sort of broadcast of that form.

26:53.540 --> 27:00.260
it only picks up I think magnetic frequencies so sorry it doesn't work that

27:00.260 --> 27:07.540
way you can't do radio do you have Final Fantasy 11 in hell no it's hell of

27:07.540 --> 27:10.980
course we have it I will post in the chat room the website that I'm going to

27:10.980 --> 27:15.980
they actually have recordings of this that's been done a while back and funny

27:15.980 --> 27:20.980
enough the guy that was basically doing this who also won a Nobel Prize and has

27:20.980 --> 27:25.820
a PhD in experimental sciences. All things that you don't have. All things that I don't

27:25.820 --> 27:31.360
have. I don't fucking care, okay? Because what I don't have, I'm going to make better

27:31.360 --> 27:39.580
because his device only had a small piece that was a 2mm by 3.5mm piece of germanium.

27:39.580 --> 27:45.280
I'm using an inch by an inch piece of germanium. It's 25 times the size. I'm just multiplying

27:45.280 --> 27:50.860
everything by 25. So are you an advocate that bigger is better? Notice how Loki has taken

27:50.860 --> 27:54.840
what you do for cookies, like when you have too much cookie dough, you just double the

27:54.840 --> 28:00.560
recipe for everything, right? He's taken that and now he's gonna multiply everything on

28:00.560 --> 28:07.320
this talking to the dead communicator by 25. He's gonna build a vortex to hell, I'm telling

28:07.320 --> 28:08.320
you.

28:08.320 --> 28:19.760
So basically he's applying the math behind cookie dough to metaphysical communication.

28:19.760 --> 28:22.920
Now what I suggested over dinner when Loki was telling us the first time is that we could

28:22.920 --> 28:26.500
take this device to golf land and really mess with people.

28:26.500 --> 28:30.200
Like I think we should hook it up so that it's in that area between the pad and the

28:30.200 --> 28:33.920
screen so when little kids run in front of it, they have, zoop, they get sucked into

28:33.920 --> 28:34.920
hell.

28:34.920 --> 28:43.520
Okay, first off, like I said before, it's not a fucking vortex to hell.

28:43.520 --> 28:47.120
That's another device to which I do not have the schematics for.

28:47.120 --> 28:50.140
Can you build one of those? Because I really want to get rid of some of those people at

28:50.140 --> 28:51.140
golf line.

28:51.140 --> 28:55.460
Did you ever see the gate? You have to dig a hole in your backyard.

28:55.460 --> 29:00.700
Okay, listen now. Honestly, seriously, I am, you know, interested in this stuff. I don't

29:00.700 --> 29:05.740
know if it's a phase or something, but I am so fucking bored at work, I have nothing to

29:05.740 --> 29:08.300
do. And this is what they're forcing me to do.

29:08.300 --> 29:13.740
So first it's cursed dolls. Now it's communicating with the dead. You can touch your dolly!

29:13.740 --> 29:23.460
That's what this is all about, is that Loki needs to talk to his dolls. Oh, you're a genius,

29:23.460 --> 29:28.060
Jamie. First off, I don't have any haunted dolls because I forgot to bid on the goddamn

29:28.060 --> 29:35.620
thing in the beginning. And second of all, okay, this doesn't have anything to do with

29:35.620 --> 29:42.220
fucking talking to dolls, okay? God damn it. Don't you want to talk to the demon or dead

29:42.220 --> 29:47.180
thing that possessed the doll? I'm loving this chat room feedback we have here. I thought

29:47.180 --> 29:52.600
there already was a vortex to hell. It's called Roseville Golf Land. That's the Bomani. That's

29:52.600 --> 29:57.620
where Bomani machines go to die. The Scandia is where Bomani goes to die. The Scandia is

29:57.620 --> 30:04.260
where Bomani goes to die again. Like, re-death. Alright, listen now. Okay. This basically,

30:04.260 --> 30:08.280
all this is right here, it's another form of EVP as I was talking about before, which

30:08.280 --> 30:13.120
which is, you know, electronic voice phenomena. It's basically what happens is you can record,

30:13.120 --> 30:19.240
you record voices that you don't hear. And they're done through, um, manipulation of

30:19.240 --> 30:24.520
the diaphragm in a microphone. Basically, you can record things like, you know, that

30:24.520 --> 30:30.080
normal humans can't hear. This would be like, they do this all the fucking time. Like, ghost

30:30.080 --> 30:31.280
researchers and stuff, they record-

30:31.280 --> 30:33.280
So they would be able to hear what dogs hear?

30:33.280 --> 30:37.680
Not necessarily, but that's a theory of mine that that's why you know

30:37.680 --> 30:43.320
You'll see dogs reacting to the Supernaturals because they can hear it or see it and we can't but anyways

30:43.320 --> 30:44.000
That's not the point

30:44.000 --> 30:50.040
The point is that this is a common you can anybody can go out there and do this and they don't even need to build

30:50.040 --> 30:52.040
a device like this and

30:52.200 --> 30:56.100
Don't even yet. Okay, anybody could do this with a tape recorder

30:56.120 --> 31:00.760
They can do this and you can actually wire something up very simple with a germanium

31:00.760 --> 31:05.760
It's a titanium diode that they supposedly sell at Radio Shack, but I sure as hell can find it today.

31:05.760 --> 31:14.760
Anyways, you can do that, and it will actually only record, um, just, you know, what you can't hear, and it will block everything else out.

31:14.760 --> 31:19.760
And it's very interesting hearing people do that, and you get some really creepy shit on there.

31:19.760 --> 31:24.760
But sure, mock me as you will. I will fucking send the vortex after you.

31:24.760 --> 31:27.760
Speaking of mocking Loki, we have a comment from the chatroom.

31:27.760 --> 31:28.760
This is the best comment ever.

31:28.760 --> 31:32.800
unknown neighbor says, Loki does want to talk to his dolls, he wants to talk to his final

31:32.800 --> 31:37.160
fantasy figurines and see if Tifa and Yuna love him.

31:37.160 --> 31:40.840
I don't even have dolls, and that's stupid.

31:40.840 --> 31:44.160
He wants to talk to his chocobogos, see if his chocobogos work at him.

31:44.160 --> 31:45.160
Can I make a joke?

31:45.160 --> 31:46.160
Can I make a joke?

31:46.160 --> 31:47.160
Okay.

31:47.160 --> 31:51.640
If you're able to build this machine and talk to the dead, will you be able to communicate

31:51.640 --> 32:03.640
it with Miss Cleo's career. Yes. You know what? Enough of this. I'm just reminded of

32:03.640 --> 32:07.640
that scene from Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey. To hell with all you people. With all of...

32:07.640 --> 32:11.640
No, no, don't say that. Don't say that, Loki, because you will do it. I know you will with

32:11.640 --> 32:07.900
this machine. No, but like that scene when they're having the seance. Honestly, R

32:07.900 --> 32:09.020
No! Don't say that!

32:09.020 --> 32:12.420
Don't say that, Loki, because you will do it. I know you will with this machine.

32:12.420 --> 32:15.820
No, but like that scene when they're having the séance.

32:15.820 --> 32:19.900
Honestly, Ragh, how many things have I built that have actually worked?

32:19.900 --> 32:23.020
That's a very good point.

32:23.020 --> 32:26.900
You know what? In defense of Loki's little idea,

32:26.900 --> 32:30.140
I'm supporting it. I'm curious.

32:30.140 --> 32:33.180
Is this what we're calling it now? It's officially the

32:33.180 --> 32:36.620
little idea? Your little idea.

32:36.620 --> 32:42.620
I will support this. I'm interested to see how it turns out.

32:42.620 --> 32:50.620
But I'm also wondering though, is it what you would use to record visual data?

32:50.620 --> 32:52.620
Actually, they have that.

32:52.620 --> 32:53.620
Really?

32:53.620 --> 32:56.620
It's been done. And it's really strange how it works too.

32:56.620 --> 32:59.620
It's basically everything revolves around white noise.

32:59.620 --> 33:02.620
In this case, what they use, a common way they use to record it,

33:02.620 --> 33:05.620
they have some other complicated devices, but the easiest way you can do it now

33:05.620 --> 33:13.060
now. So you take a video camera and you record, you basically put the output onto a TV, then

33:13.060 --> 33:17.080
you record that. And it creates interference because it's recording the same fucking thing

33:17.080 --> 33:21.460
over and over. But in that, when you record that, you go back frame by frame, and you'll

33:21.460 --> 33:25.780
actually see shit on there. And they have pictures of it that have been done. It's very

33:25.780 --> 33:29.820
interesting. But the guy that did the experiments, he actually had his own device, because this

33:29.820 --> 33:34.420
is like way back in the day when, you know, TVs and shit were fucking expensive, and,

33:34.420 --> 33:38.780
you know computers are the size of football fields and whatnot we need to

33:38.780 --> 33:41.940
have to take it like a billion magnets and put them in a room to make exactly

33:41.940 --> 33:47.900
kill the pipe so so basically you know this is something he made a while back

33:47.900 --> 33:52.260
and supposedly what happened was is later on people recreated this

33:52.260 --> 33:56.140
experiment in the 90s the most recent I've heard of this experiment being

33:56.140 --> 34:00.820
recreated was in 2003 I don't really know there's I guess for some reason

34:00.820 --> 34:05.100
like for a few years they had no results recreating the same thing because there's a lot of other

34:05.100 --> 34:08.820
factors that they can't figure in that they don't know what the hell, you know, why it

34:08.820 --> 34:13.820
doesn't work or why it works. It goes to camera shy? No, it's not camera shy. It's complicated.

34:13.820 --> 34:18.020
Anyways, I'll give you guys the websites. You can go look at it. You can think I'm crazy.

34:18.020 --> 34:23.620
That's fine, but this is what I'm reading up on and I mean I'm not a real believer in

34:23.620 --> 34:28.620
the paranormal and whatnot, but I'm a believer in science and, you know, they have scientific

34:28.620 --> 34:31.920
proof to prove this they just can't explain it it's obviously beyond our

34:31.920 --> 34:37.760
knowledge now so I don't know it just sounds interesting and if it's so easy

34:37.760 --> 34:44.160
to recreate the experiment then you know why not but yeah I'm crazy but the thing

34:44.160 --> 34:47.520
is though the guy there's another guy there's another guy to create this thing

34:47.520 --> 34:54.360
called illuminator which is basically it's some sort of device that it it's

34:54.360 --> 34:58.640
uses fans or something it blows water through rings of water or air through

34:58.640 --> 35:02.320
rings of water I don't know how the fuck that happens but anyway supposedly that

35:02.320 --> 35:06.160
creates a weird field or something if you photograph someone with that field

35:06.160 --> 35:11.520
you'll actually see like someone else's face on theirs it's kind of weird then

35:11.520 --> 35:15.960
the guy supposedly put three of these in like a triangle configuration and that

35:15.960 --> 35:21.520
created the vortex you know that you were also talking about and he saw the

35:21.520 --> 35:27.640
Triforce no but I was gonna ask something about the I was my train of

35:27.640 --> 35:31.720
thought because I've made the Triforce joke never mind keep talking anyways I

35:31.720 --> 35:36.960
will post the links in the chat room but there's some interesting stuff there's a

35:36.960 --> 35:41.040
whole bunch of stuff on EVPs you can listen to they're really creepy look

35:41.040 --> 35:45.800
sounding stuff but it's a lot of documentation on this there's a lot of

35:45.800 --> 35:49.480
people recreate in the same way so I mean if they're you didn't a lot of

35:49.480 --> 35:53.120
people that are getting these results, I mean, scientifically you can prove it.

35:53.120 --> 35:56.840
Is it like the dead boy in Three Men and a Baby?

35:56.840 --> 36:00.320
Uh, what? You know what I was thinking is that you should

36:00.320 --> 36:05.120
take this whole little idea of yours and you should film it all and put it on like public

36:05.120 --> 36:10.920
access TV. You could be the new Mr. Wizard. Wouldn't that be cool?

36:10.920 --> 36:18.280
No. No, but, um, you know, their, I don't know, their results were just kind of, like,

36:18.280 --> 36:22.800
weird, because the one thing that they were saying that's important about this is resonance,

36:22.800 --> 36:26.880
and anyone that doesn't know what resonance means, that's just, like, for example, resonance

36:26.880 --> 36:32.280
on a radio would be tuning in, because you have all the, um, frequencies out there, and

36:32.280 --> 36:37.560
each station has its own frequencies, so you tune it to whatever station, and then you're

36:37.560 --> 36:41.220
in resonance with that station when you're and you basically get audio that

36:41.220 --> 36:46.380
way well the thing with this is you have to be resonance with your thoughts or

36:46.380 --> 36:50.460
your basically your aura or whatever and that's the thing that's difficult

36:50.460 --> 36:54.580
because it's not only you it's the people around you and those all affect

36:54.580 --> 36:59.760
your environment plus you know other factors so it's a lot of complex shit

36:59.760 --> 37:05.140
there but I don't know I'm gonna do it until I get bored with it and then then

37:05.140 --> 37:08.700
I'm ready to talk about my week and my day now.

37:08.700 --> 37:09.700
You got my joke.

37:09.700 --> 37:10.700
What joke?

37:10.700 --> 37:14.620
Didn't you ever see the thing about three men and a baby?

37:14.620 --> 37:15.620
No.

37:15.620 --> 37:16.620
Loki?

37:16.620 --> 37:17.620
No.

37:17.620 --> 37:20.660
About the one scene where they're walking in front of a window and there's a little

37:20.660 --> 37:25.020
boy standing behind this curtain and he was supposed to have been like some ghost who

37:25.020 --> 37:29.140
imprinted himself on the film.

37:29.140 --> 37:33.220
He like blew his head off with a shotgun or something and then they walk by again and

37:33.220 --> 37:35.720
I've seen it, the shotgun's there.

37:35.720 --> 37:36.720
You're crazy talkin'.

37:36.720 --> 37:40.720
Oh, I had the movie on tape, I can show it to you.

37:40.720 --> 37:41.720
Bitch, please.

37:41.720 --> 37:44.920
But I was, um, my friend was at a theater and said that it, well, I actually cleared

37:44.920 --> 37:47.560
out the theater because everyone saw it and was freaked out by it.

37:47.560 --> 37:48.560
That is strange.

37:48.560 --> 37:49.560
Three Minute Baby.

37:49.560 --> 37:51.920
Oh, God, now you've got Loki on another thing.

37:51.920 --> 37:52.920
It was in Three Minute Baby.

37:52.920 --> 37:55.080
Now he's going to start inserting ghosts into movies.

37:55.080 --> 38:00.360
Well, no, seriously, because he's, he's like, and you, you can fully see him there.

38:00.360 --> 38:02.720
I wouldn't I wouldn't just say this if I have I mean

38:03.420 --> 38:06.380
I'm sure that the logical thing is that it's some prop or something

38:06.900 --> 38:09.440
But the other is that see

38:13.060 --> 38:15.060
Interesting didn't I tell you

38:15.420 --> 38:21.100
It's like shows up several times. You put that link in our chat room for those that want to check that out. All right. Hey anyway

38:22.260 --> 38:26.360
You're weak Rob. Yes my week. I actually went out and played DDR this week one night

38:26.360 --> 38:31.060
I went to Roosevelt Golf Land, because my friend had never seen DDR before.

38:31.060 --> 38:35.260
Well, I mean, actually he'd seen DDR, but he wanted to see me play DDR, because he hadn't seen, like, Extreme.

38:35.260 --> 38:38.560
So I went, and I played, and I felt really stupid.

38:38.560 --> 38:43.360
Like, I don't know how you guys feel about playing DDR for your friends for the first time,

38:43.360 --> 38:45.360
when you're, like, pretty good at DDR.

38:45.360 --> 38:49.760
Like, I can play at a maniac level, like I'm sure a lot of people listening to the show can.

38:49.760 --> 38:55.660
And to those that don't really see DDR a whole lot, I think it really weirds them out sometimes.

38:55.660 --> 38:57.660
I don't know maybe it's just me

38:58.820 --> 39:00.900
But he seemed to get a kick out of that

39:00.900 --> 39:06.460
but the thing was is that the up arrow on extreme was broken so like half my notes weren't registering and then I went to

39:06.460 --> 39:08.460
try and play guitar freaks and

39:08.460 --> 39:10.820
Frickin that machine was sucking too. So

39:11.740 --> 39:17.080
The hell with that place money machines go to die, but I did at least go out to play the ER this week

39:17.080 --> 39:19.740
I was gonna try and play at home, but my stupid ignition pads broken

39:19.740 --> 39:24.060
So either I'm gonna have to buy a new ignition pad or Loki's gonna have to finish his DDR pads

39:24.060 --> 39:28.460
But since he's too busy building vortexes to hell, it's probably not going to happen anytime soon.

39:28.460 --> 39:31.060
I was going to work on that. That's why I'm rewiring everything.

39:31.060 --> 39:34.060
Sure. All right. We'll see.

39:36.060 --> 39:40.060
Anyway, I guess that's pretty... I don't really have a whole lot to say about my week and my day.

39:40.060 --> 39:43.060
It wasn't that exciting.

39:44.060 --> 39:49.060
I had a fine weekend. I went to a little gathering last night, and that was cool, I guess.

39:49.060 --> 39:55.760
then two days ago, what did I do Friday night? I went out to a party with some friends and

39:55.760 --> 40:03.820
then went to a bar. Isn't that exciting? That's it. Excitement is now. They have pinball machines

40:03.820 --> 40:10.900
at this bar now though. Which ones? Uh, what was it, Monopoly? They have that everywhere.

40:10.900 --> 40:17.460
And the one with the aliens in the hologram, Revenge of Mars. Ooh. Yeah. Cool. But it's

40:17.460 --> 40:22.540
just kind of funny to see those that you know at a game are. If anybody in town happens

40:22.540 --> 40:28.860
to find a Black Knight 2000 pinball, tell me. Cause Black Knight 2000 pinball is like

40:28.860 --> 40:33.700
the most awesome pinball ever. Maybe they'll have one at the Classic Gaming Expo, which

40:33.700 --> 40:37.860
you know we're going to be making an appearance at. Woohoo! Classic Gaming Expo, alright.

40:37.860 --> 40:41.180
Cause I, um Konami is supposed to be doing something there. Yes, Konami is doing something

40:41.180 --> 40:46.820
there. Some of our buddies at KDA are actually working the booth there. They're working a

40:46.820 --> 40:50.820
I sort of know what's going on, but I think it's supposed to be a secret, so I can't repeat it.

40:50.820 --> 40:51.820
It's a secret to everyone.

40:51.820 --> 40:54.820
It's not Bamani related, but it's very cool nonetheless.

40:54.820 --> 40:55.820
Unless we play track and field.

40:55.820 --> 40:57.820
That would be cool.

40:57.820 --> 40:58.820
That would be awesome.

40:58.820 --> 41:05.820
Alright. But I definitely want to go. So we'll be making an appearance there next weekend.

41:05.820 --> 41:10.820
It may affect next week's show, actually, but we're not sure yet. We think we might still have a show next weekend.

41:10.820 --> 41:12.820
But Jamie's still going to be there.

41:12.820 --> 41:13.820
Minus one.

41:13.820 --> 41:24.820
I'm actually going to be there partly for the show and partly with my fiancé.

41:24.820 --> 41:25.820
Right.

41:27.820 --> 41:31.820
Well, we'll have to pre-tape the show if we decide to be at Classic Gaming Expo all next week.

41:31.820 --> 41:32.820
So, we'll figure something out.

41:32.820 --> 41:33.820
Alright.

41:34.820 --> 41:36.820
I think what we do now is we're going to go to break.

41:36.820 --> 41:38.820
And when we come back we'll actually talk about some Bahmani stuff.

41:38.820 --> 41:44.820
There's been lots of Ultramix 2 news and DDR Extreme news this week.

41:44.820 --> 41:48.820
Speaking of DDR Extreme, I think in this break we're going to play some music from DDR Extreme,

41:48.820 --> 41:51.820
including, why not? We'll do Your Rain the Rage Mix again.

41:51.820 --> 41:53.820
Let's start off.

41:53.820 --> 41:55.820
That's right, we're going to start off with Your Rain the Rage Mix.

41:55.820 --> 42:00.820
So enjoy Your Rain the Rage Mix, presented by Orangelaunchradio.com and Derspot.com.

42:00.820 --> 42:02.820
We'll be back after this

42:30.820 --> 42:36.820
And I don't know what I've found

42:36.820 --> 42:47.820
Over and over I feel it break me down

42:47.820 --> 42:52.820
I'm waiting for a gentle rain

42:52.820 --> 42:57.820
A gentle rain, a gentle rain

42:57.820 --> 43:02.820
On the sidewalk, on the city, on the streets just for a whisper

43:02.820 --> 43:07.820
Busy people, going nowhere, seeing a joke in the rain

43:07.820 --> 43:12.820
Nothing but passion, nothing matters, my resistance is waning

43:12.820 --> 43:21.820
Like a flower in a basement, waiting for our love again

43:21.820 --> 43:49.820
Look at what you see Hey, the mirror of a dream

43:49.820 --> 43:53.820
Never of a dream

43:53.820 --> 43:56.820
Made believe I'm everywhere

43:56.820 --> 44:00.820
Living in your eyes

44:00.820 --> 44:03.820
Return on the pages

44:03.820 --> 44:05.820
If she ever does do a

44:05.820 --> 44:09.820
Never ending story

44:09.820 --> 44:13.820
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

44:13.820 --> 44:16.820
Never ending story

44:16.820 --> 44:18.820
We are

44:27.820 --> 44:30.820
Why'd you keep that secret

44:30.820 --> 44:33.820
When I fall behind the clouds

44:34.820 --> 44:37.820
There upon the rainbow

44:37.820 --> 44:41.820
The answer to my terror ends

45:11.820 --> 45:28.140
Okay y'all this is it, now pump it, the mic will sing as soon as I touch it, do this smooth

45:28.140 --> 45:32.620
and easy like, so we might get hyped to hear tonight, she might, relax, and see from the

45:32.620 --> 45:36.220
back, if you ain't with that, I'ma have to attack you with a bad rap, that could smack

45:36.220 --> 45:40.380
this my whoop if they jack, when I start no crap, give it a little bit of heart and soul

45:40.380 --> 45:44.700
As we do it till you in your ear hole, huh I ain't goin' out like a sucka

45:44.700 --> 45:48.380
And if you think so, boy, then pucker Off your chips, I better get clear and sit

45:48.380 --> 45:51.380
It's slow and I might burn up this groove That you do move you

45:51.380 --> 45:53.380
Fight people now, it's time to

46:23.380 --> 46:30.380
After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move marathon.

46:30.380 --> 46:31.380
Nooooooo!

46:31.380 --> 46:37.180
Just kidding, Orange Lounge Radio, crap-free Bhavani radio.

46:37.180 --> 46:40.580
Yes, mostly crap-free, except for this show, of course.

46:40.580 --> 46:45.580
You are tuned into Orange Lounge Radio, and we are here with episode number 107.

46:45.580 --> 46:49.580
I want to take a little break there talking about some new songs that are going to be

46:49.580 --> 46:50.580
in D.R.

46:50.580 --> 46:51.580
Extreme.

46:51.580 --> 46:55.860
you know, not all new. Of course, Your Rain was new, but we have some old classics there,

46:55.860 --> 46:59.700
Never Ending Story and Wonderland. I noticed this kind of seems to be happening quite a

46:59.700 --> 47:03.020
bit where they're getting a lot of old songs and putting them in these new DR games we

47:03.020 --> 47:06.780
have coming out. What else did we have in Extreme that was going to be in there? Well,

47:06.780 --> 47:14.500
Only You, There You'll Be, Kick the Can, Don't Clock Me from Solo, like all these old-ass

47:14.500 --> 47:21.400
songs. I think it's kind of cool though. Sugaru, that's kind of old now. I don't know. Dot

47:21.400 --> 47:30.940
five nine. Alright. So we are here on Orange Orange Radio and kind of talking about some

47:30.940 --> 47:33.800
news that happened last week. I wanted to talk about some things that happened while

47:33.800 --> 47:39.260
we were here. We were doing that show last week but we were kind of sidetracked so we

47:39.260 --> 47:42.760
didn't get to talk a whole lot about some of the news that had been going on last week.

47:42.760 --> 47:46.920
I kind of want to bring some of that up now, including all this stuff that was going on

47:46.920 --> 47:47.920
about 2DX Red.

47:47.920 --> 47:49.320
Have you guys heard about this?

47:49.320 --> 47:54.120
This 2DX 11th style, or whatever you want to call it, is now kind of a project named

47:54.120 --> 48:00.200
2DX Red, and it's got all these different songs in there, a new DJ Simon song, Back

48:00.200 --> 48:04.480
to the Dance Floor, new Orange Lounge songs in it, new Naoki song, and all this stuff

48:04.480 --> 48:10.260
in 2DX Red, and supposedly there's this really, really hard song that's in it, that has this

48:10.260 --> 48:14.260
really hard note pattern and actually one of my buddies was kind enough to

48:14.260 --> 48:17.260
send me a video of it so I'll show you guys kind of what this looks like now

48:17.260 --> 48:22.140
he's playing it on random in this video and I know this is gonna be great radio

48:22.140 --> 48:25.700
but at least you can hear the song a little bit but the song is called

48:25.700 --> 48:32.100
gigadelic gigadelic and let's see if we can get a little bit of what it looks

48:32.100 --> 48:35.460
like here that's kind of what the interface looks like pretty yeah it's

48:35.460 --> 48:37.460
Very pretty, isn't it?

48:37.460 --> 48:40.460
Oh, they're using the towel method.

48:40.460 --> 48:43.460
Yes, they are using the towel method. Explain what the towel method is.

48:43.460 --> 48:45.460
It...

48:45.460 --> 48:48.460
I will, I guess, read just your eyesight or something in the way you can read it easier.

48:48.460 --> 48:51.460
Let me show you what the end of the song looks like here.

48:51.460 --> 48:53.460
Actually, that part doesn't look so hard, but...

48:53.460 --> 48:55.460
There you go.

48:55.460 --> 48:57.460
Kind of a crazy song in the end there.

49:01.460 --> 49:03.460
I like the video.

49:03.460 --> 49:08.460
It looks like they've made the interface a lot prettier, that they have the bars.

49:08.460 --> 49:14.460
Basically what they did in 2DX Red, I noticed, is that they took one half of the screen.

49:14.460 --> 49:19.460
You remember when you would play 2DX, the side, if you were just in one player mode,

49:19.460 --> 49:25.460
the other half of the screen would have nothing, like it would just be a blank place for notes to fall.

49:25.460 --> 49:27.460
What they've done is they've kind of done the keyboard mania thing.

49:27.460 --> 49:30.460
I don't know how many of you guys have played keyboard mania, but keyboard mania had two monitors.

49:30.460 --> 49:33.660
monitors. And if you were playing it just in one player mode, it would show you like

49:33.660 --> 49:36.900
a little bar on the other side that would show you like how you were doing with your

49:36.900 --> 49:40.700
combo and stuff. It's not quite that what they're doing in 2DX Red, but they've taken

49:40.700 --> 49:46.700
it and now it's showing a graph of your score compared to the top score on the machine.

49:46.700 --> 49:49.860
So I thought that was kind of cool is that you'd have a little bar that would go up as

49:49.860 --> 49:56.220
you did really good or really crappy on the song. So I thought that was kind of neat.

49:56.220 --> 50:00.180
So that's something that's going to be new in 2DX Red.

50:00.180 --> 50:03.660
So I don't know when this game is supposed to be out, but it looks kind of exciting.

50:03.660 --> 50:08.240
So there's some old news on 2DX Red on our website, of course, if you want to check that

50:08.240 --> 50:12.940
out over on OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

50:12.940 --> 50:16.580
Also something we kind of had to gloss through real fast last week, Loki, and you've had

50:16.580 --> 50:21.020
a chance to really sit down with us now, we've had another week go by and play this, what

50:21.020 --> 50:22.940
about Food Mix?

50:22.940 --> 50:25.940
There was a Food Mix Plus release last week.

50:25.940 --> 50:28.940
It was fucking awesome, that's all I have to say.

50:28.940 --> 50:37.940
There was about 15 new songs that they added, brand new interface, brand new non-stop O&E courses, and it's beautiful.

50:37.940 --> 50:45.940
They made what Food Mix was before, which was really awesome, and made it even better. It's just really kickass.

50:45.940 --> 50:53.940
From what I hear, though, the double steps leave a little bit to be desired, but their single steps are awesome, because I haven't gotten to play doubles yet.

50:53.940 --> 50:58.940
But really beautiful, awesome, brand new videos. Just really awesome.

50:58.940 --> 51:10.940
They've got a lot of nifty stuff that you can do now in StepMania. Like, for instance, the results screen has a type of graph that you would see in BeatMania where it shows you how you did and everything, and your combo and all that.

51:10.940 --> 51:35.940
I noticed something interesting they did with the movies is that they put a watermark of the song name in there, like at least that one for Made in Innocent that had the anime girl in it and stuff. They kind of put a watermark on the movie. Was there an issue where some of their movies were being pirated on other step files or something?

51:35.940 --> 51:42.940
No, it was just a little cool thing in the bottom. That's all. It was just for the one song. It just looked cool.

51:42.940 --> 51:51.940
But, um, it was just, um, they actually, what I like about them is they use video and, you know, still images just like you would in, uh, BMS files.

51:51.940 --> 51:57.940
Because, I mean, these guys are coming from BMS files, and just the animations that they do in that are just awesome.

51:57.940 --> 52:09.940
I really wish a lot of the US people would go and start doing BMS sim files first and then going to DWIs, but it's just amazing the amount of work that they put in these.

52:27.940 --> 52:30.940
But it was just the maiden innocent that had that? I thought I saw it on another one.

52:30.940 --> 52:33.940
Alright, so I'm going to crack. I don't care.

52:33.940 --> 52:38.940
There's a few of them that say Foon Mix Plus in them, but that's about... I mean, so what? Who cares?

52:38.940 --> 52:49.940
It's just awesome. That's pretty much it. They just have really awesome stuff. Like I said before, a lot of the music that's actually featured on there is going to be on Diverse 7, which you can find.

52:49.940 --> 52:54.940
And that comes in three different varieties, which I can talk about now or later either way.

52:54.940 --> 52:55.940
Sure, why not?

52:55.940 --> 53:02.620
transition into that. Anyways, Diverse System 7, which is out I think now, or pretty soon

53:02.620 --> 53:07.300
either way, they've got a bunch of different ways you can get this, and I'm not sure, now

53:07.300 --> 53:11.220
what I'm gathering from this, because it's all in Japanese, is that they either have

53:11.220 --> 53:16.660
three CDs, and I think two of them are BMS files, which are basically your BeatMania

53:16.660 --> 53:21.780
sim files, and they're really awesome. Like, for instance, we'll go down with FiveKey and

53:21.780 --> 53:25.720
what they have on there we have a remix of super highway called super highway

53:25.720 --> 53:33.120
the cafe electro mix by a guy named Oni or only I should say a remix of what's

53:33.120 --> 53:38.640
next with song title what with a bunch of question marks at the end there by a

53:38.640 --> 53:46.200
guy named new keep on moving romantic blue style by a guy named Teo we've got

53:46.200 --> 53:57.200
Gnaw, which is a remix of Area Code, and we've got a Ska, The Good Mix, that's a Ska, A Go Go remix.

53:57.200 --> 54:04.200
Ninja Blast, Hayabusa Mix, which is a remix of Overblast.

54:04.200 --> 54:09.200
Acid Bomb, the Overdosing remix is a remix of Acid Bomb.

54:09.200 --> 54:12.200
Slash Tracks, which is a remix of Thrash Tracks.

54:12.200 --> 54:17.900
Recycle, a remix of Cycle by Splunker, which is awesome. He's done some really

54:17.900 --> 54:25.600
good stuff. SDZ, which is The Gleam, which is a remix of SDZ. I'm not

54:25.600 --> 54:30.120
familiar with that one. And then, oh man, I'm gonna fuck this up.

54:30.120 --> 54:36.280
Notch Musik, which is You Gotta Groove remix, and that's of course a remix of

54:36.280 --> 54:41.240
You Gotta Groove. And then Seven Keys, some of the other ones that they have on

54:41.240 --> 54:46.360
here they have a remix of murmur twins the oh hey we've got some demo mp3s here

54:46.360 --> 54:50.080
but uh I'll get those later we could play them maybe during a break or

54:50.080 --> 54:58.560
something anyways murmur twins the 460 beat mix reality the alpha 0.2 mix some

54:58.560 --> 55:04.800
other song in Japanese bad boy bass the switch back to 93 remix maiden innocent

55:04.800 --> 55:12.040
which is featured in Food Mix Plus. I just hope that Bad Boy Bass remix has that sample

55:12.040 --> 55:16.200
still in it. One more time with the Bad Boy Bass. One more time with the Bad Boy Bass.

55:16.200 --> 55:25.600
I'm sure it will. YSQ, let's see, number one, or number 12.8, Holix, which is also in Food

55:25.600 --> 55:32.480
Mix Plus. Love Heart Sign. We have X2, which is a G2 remix, also in Food Mix Plus. And

55:32.480 --> 55:37.420
Small Voyager which is obviously a remix of the big Voyager and then they have

55:37.420 --> 55:44.340
one last one which is other mixes and that's Timepiece Phase 2 High

55:44.340 --> 55:49.820
Transparency Mix which is a one phase blues I think a remix. Healing

55:49.820 --> 55:56.000
Vision remix which is just that. Over the Drive, Mirrorball Satellite 2004 which is

55:56.000 --> 56:00.260
in the original Foon mix. That sounds awesome because that's an info song. Yeah

56:00.260 --> 56:16.260
Yeah, and it was pretty good. Then there's a few other ones I'll see here. Yamadajet, Coaster Girl, which is a Yamadajet remix. It's kind of funny. Implantation, DVMix, Lamb of God, Trip Machine, Dark Core Mix, and some other ones.

56:16.260 --> 56:26.260
But I'm going to get some of these demo MP3s and we can maybe play them on a break or something, because they're usually about 30 seconds long, so we'll get a bunch of different songs there.

56:26.260 --> 56:28.260
Sure, that sounds like fun. Why not?

56:28.260 --> 56:53.260
I'm going to change gears here because I want to talk about Ultramix 2 because the Ultramix 2 news has been flying really fast this week. There's been a lot of new stuff announced for Ultramix 2 within this week and last week and that's including some songs. Some new songs have been announced for these games so I want to see if we can address what some of those songs are.

56:53.260 --> 56:56.740
Some things that have been figured out is that

56:56.740 --> 57:00.140
we got some early songs have been announced for UltraMix 2 including

57:00.140 --> 57:02.140
321 Stars by DJ Simon

57:02.140 --> 57:06.500
A by DJ Amuro and B4U by Naoki which were all

57:06.500 --> 57:10.500
if I remember right in the E3 demo so none of that's a surprise but get this

57:10.500 --> 57:12.340
here's your first licensed song

57:12.340 --> 57:15.620
from UltraMix 2, Brick House by the Commodores

57:15.620 --> 57:18.780
Isn't that crazy? Is it

57:18.780 --> 57:21.860
like a remix of it? No, it's the original. She's a brick

57:21.860 --> 57:24.860
Oh, cool. Yeah, that's going to be cool.

57:24.860 --> 57:28.660
I wish I had a clip of that so I could play it for you guys. It's pretty cool.

57:28.660 --> 57:33.980
And Dead End by NNS. Drop out, NW260, LeadingCyber, DJ Taka,

57:33.980 --> 57:39.380
LoveHeartShine, Coscariu, Make a Jam, U1, Make Your Move, Good Cool, featuring JP

57:39.380 --> 57:42.900
Miles, Max Unlimited is going to be in it. Then we get into some more

57:42.900 --> 57:46.420
licenses we haven't had in the US yet. Moonlight Shadow

57:46.420 --> 57:49.780
by Missing Heart from Fifth Mix. Very popular license track.

57:49.780 --> 57:53.940
Yeah, very popular license track, getting a lot of people really geared up for Ultra

57:53.940 --> 57:55.980
Mix 2, very happy about that.

57:55.980 --> 58:00.620
My summer love, Night in Motion, which was actually a license track.

58:00.620 --> 58:06.780
A lot of people think that that is a Konami original, but it was actually a license track

58:06.780 --> 58:08.740
from DDR4thMix.

58:08.740 --> 58:12.700
And you would know this song, definitely, because it has that really catchy hook at

58:12.700 --> 58:13.700
the beginning of it.

58:13.700 --> 58:14.700
Here's a little bit of it.

58:14.700 --> 58:21.540
Wait, let me get a little bit of the hook here.

58:21.540 --> 58:36.020
Everybody knows that song, all right, so that one's going to be in a DDR Ultra Mix.

58:36.020 --> 58:41.860
Right on the Light by Mr. T. Now wait a minute, that's a 2DX song that's being ported over

58:41.860 --> 58:42.860
for DDR.

58:42.860 --> 58:43.860
That's cool.

58:43.860 --> 58:48.100
So that is something brand new that we've never had in DDR before, and it doesn't stop

58:48.100 --> 58:49.100
there.

58:49.100 --> 58:51.900
Um, Route 80s by Sampling Masters Mega.

58:51.900 --> 58:52.900
Cool.

58:52.900 --> 58:53.900
From DDR.

58:53.900 --> 58:54.900
The attention.

58:54.900 --> 58:55.900
Attention.

58:55.900 --> 58:56.900
Yeah.

58:56.900 --> 58:57.900
We're actually gonna play some of these songs.

58:57.900 --> 58:58.900
For those of you that haven't heard them.

58:58.900 --> 58:59.900
Do it for the next break.

58:59.900 --> 59:00.900
Yeah, we'll do that in the next break.

59:00.900 --> 59:02.780
We're gonna play some of these songs for those that haven't heard them before.

59:02.780 --> 59:05.980
Star Mine by Ryu from 2DX4 style.

59:05.980 --> 59:06.980
You remember that?

59:06.980 --> 59:09.020
With Tran with the little fan in a doo doo doo doo doo.

59:09.020 --> 59:10.500
Star Mine will be fun.

59:10.500 --> 59:20.980
going to be very fun on DDR. Well, this is the interesting thing is that they have said

59:20.980 --> 59:27.100
in the thread that different people are doing the steps than did them for UltraMix 1. So,

59:27.100 --> 59:32.420
you're not going to see steps like you saw in UltraMix 1. And supposedly they have people

59:32.420 --> 59:38.820
that know their stuff on DDR that are making these steps, so. So it's not Konami of Hawaii?

59:38.820 --> 59:49.820
Well, I don't think they really said one way or the other. I haven't been keeping tabs on the information thread, and also I don't want to cross the line from what I've been told.

59:49.820 --> 59:59.820
Yeah, I can't. I don't know what I can say and what I can't, so I'm just going to move on to the next song, which is from 2DX, VJ Army by Good Cool.

59:59.820 --> 01:00:01.820
Now that's cool. VJ Army will be fun.

01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:05.500
army is going to be fun. A lot of people have said that should be in DDR for a long time,

01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:10.020
so that's very cool that that one's going to make it in there. So, it's okay, if you've

01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:13.600
never played 2DX and you've never heard these songs before, we're going to play them for

01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:16.380
you in the next break, so you can get a feel of what you're going to be dancing to pretty

01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:23.860
soon. God dammit, does that mean I have to buy an Xbox? This is very interesting. When

01:00:23.860 --> 01:00:29.020
Ultramix 2 was first announced, a lot of people were like, yeah, whatever. Cause I think Ultramix

01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:34.020
was very successful for those that already had an Xbox, but it didn't really convert

01:00:34.020 --> 01:00:38.800
a whole lot of people. I'm an exception, I did buy an Xbox pretty much so I could play

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:41.880
UltraMix, UltraMix and Halo. This new one's sounding like it's going to be a big selling

01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:47.640
point. But this new one, Microsoft should be sucking Konami's cock for this one, seriously,

01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:51.480
because they're going to sell a lot of Xboxes with this mix, I think, based on DDR fans

01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:57.620
alone, because... Microsoft better put out. Seriously, Microsoft should be putting out...

01:00:57.620 --> 01:01:02.260
I don't know, maybe I should put a poll up over and see how many people are

01:01:02.260 --> 01:01:05.660
seriously contemplating buying an Xbox just because of UltraMix 2. Because a lot of

01:01:05.660 --> 01:01:06.700
people were saying

01:01:06.700 --> 01:01:10.900
when UltraMix 2 was first announced, yeah, yeah, yeah, great, UltraMix 2, yeah, whatever,

01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:15.300
you know, Xbox people will enjoy it. But now that the song list is starting to come out and

01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:18.100
people are like, whoa, we're getting Moonlight Shadow and

01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:21.060
these 2DX songs that have never been in DDR before.

01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:26.300
Actually, I have to agree with Kyle in the chat room. I think I actually

01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:28.300
I wouldn't mind seeing Get On Beat Wildstyle.

01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:31.300
Actually, I wouldn't mind seeing the original Get On Beat.

01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:33.300
Well, this certainly is not the full list.

01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:37.300
This is just what we know so far about UltraMix 2.

01:01:37.300 --> 01:01:40.300
Or Lab. They need to put Lab.

01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:44.300
Here's one thing I think is kind of different about UltraMix 2.

01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:47.300
They just announced this this week.

01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:50.300
There's going to be a brand new dance mode in UltraMix 2.

01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:55.300
What makes an Xbox different than a PlayStation 2?

01:01:55.300 --> 01:02:01.060
the other than the obvious Microsoft and it has you can store a small family

01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:06.380
inside of it besides that it has a really big hard drive and four port ah

01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:11.620
it has four ports as opposed to two which means what you can plug in four

01:02:11.620 --> 01:02:16.660
dance pads you don't need a multi tab yeah you don't need a multi tab but no

01:02:16.660 --> 01:02:21.140
now you can plug in four dance pads at once and you can play a brand new mode

01:02:21.140 --> 01:02:25.140
The code called Quad Mode is going to be in Ultramix 2.

01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:27.140
How four? Wow!

01:02:27.140 --> 01:02:32.140
It's going to be four... No, it's four pads. It's a whole new set of steps for one person on four pads.

01:02:32.140 --> 01:02:34.140
It's doubles doubles.

01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:36.140
Evil.

01:02:36.140 --> 01:02:40.140
So you could have arrows that take you all the way from pad number one, way on the left, to pad number four.

01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:44.140
And a lot of people were talking about, well, what's the configuration going to be?

01:02:44.140 --> 01:02:47.140
Because if you think about Tetris, you could have four squares a lot of different ways.

01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:49.140
It's going to be one giant line.

01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:52.900
I'd have to say that I copyrighted this about two years ago, they will be hearing from my

01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:53.900
lawyers.

01:02:53.900 --> 01:02:59.620
Okay, because I was making edits for two machines that use all four panels.

01:02:59.620 --> 01:03:02.460
Two different sets of edits to play one song.

01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:03.980
That was my quad mode.

01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:08.020
God damn it, they stole it from me.

01:03:08.020 --> 01:03:10.700
I actually remember doing something like this.

01:03:10.700 --> 01:03:14.700
Like I remember one time in Arcade Infinity starting two machines at the same time to

01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:16.460
do some kind of like quad thing.

01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:20.460
but I don't remember what the joke was, but there was something we were trying to do.

01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:24.740
But yeah, but you know what? What does it seem like happening with this mix though?

01:03:24.740 --> 01:03:26.260
With the song list and

01:03:26.260 --> 01:03:29.060
it looks like they're listing their fan base a little more, so I wouldn't be

01:03:29.060 --> 01:03:29.740
surprised

01:03:29.740 --> 01:03:33.380
if they did look out there and see that maybe there are people, crazy as they

01:03:33.380 --> 01:03:34.100
might be,

01:03:34.100 --> 01:03:38.020
that want this quad mode in DDR. Now, me personally, I'm kinda like,

01:03:38.020 --> 01:03:41.420
well I think it's a nice idea, like the quad mode, I think it's kinda cute,

01:03:41.420 --> 01:03:45.620
but who's gonna have four dance pads? It's innovative, I'll say that.

01:03:45.620 --> 01:04:00.620
But then, okay, here's the argument to that, is that quad mode is only going to be available in something called the party mode on UltraMix 2, so it's obviously set up for DDR parties, I mean, as cheesy as that might sound, where your friends bring their dance pads over to your house, so now you have four dances.

01:04:00.620 --> 01:04:04.620
Or maybe it's going to be something cool, like two people can play doubles.

01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:05.620
Well, I don't...

01:04:05.620 --> 01:04:06.620
They have doubles versus, sorry.

01:04:06.620 --> 01:04:08.620
Yeah, you can do doubles versus, apparently, as well.

01:04:08.620 --> 01:04:09.620
That's right.

01:04:09.620 --> 01:04:14.240
I think that was something in UltraMix 1, but yeah, now you're gonna be able to have this quad mode

01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:18.420
So a whole new set of steps and it's not just once they are doing beginner light

01:04:19.620 --> 01:04:21.620
Medium heavy whatever the hell they call it these days

01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:27.300
No, I think they said it was gonna be a full for beginner light standard and heavy

01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:32.600
I'd have to relook through but I'm almost positive. They said it was gonna be a full new set. We'll see

01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:34.940
so

01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:37.880
That's very interesting, huh? I want them to do

01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:45.880
Do another best hits on Xbox and bring out the individual mixes on one DVD.

01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:47.880
The old arcade mixes.

01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:50.880
But remember, the US isn't Japan.

01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:56.880
Unless they put it out for Japanese Xbox, but they'll never do it because Xbox wasn't really popular over there.

01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:58.880
It's still in stuff.

01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:02.880
But not quite the prevalence it has in the US market. Let's put it that way.

01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:08.880
I don't think that it would be neat so that I can, you know, not have to break out my Dreamcast every time I want to play Second Mix.

01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:12.880
Well, they do have Second Mix on PlayStation.

01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:14.880
You can go to that bowling alley in Auburn.

01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:15.880
There you go.

01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:17.880
Let's see, what else?

01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:21.880
Multiple players on, this is another interesting thing about UltraMix 2.

01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:25.880
Now you can have multiple players on one Xbox going onto Xbox Live to play.

01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:34.880
So now you don't have to be, you know, you have to stay home, you can, it's kind of going more into the multiplayer and party functions where you can have multiple people over.

01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:50.880
The song list will contain 70 songs not including the song packs, which means that if you buy your song packs from service pack 1 through 6 for UltraMix 1, you can use these on UltraMix 2.

01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:54.880
So think about this, that's 30 songs between service packs 1 through 6, right?

01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:59.480
I speculated this while somebody was out of town.

01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:00.800
I do believe I did.

01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:01.800
Yeah.

01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:02.800
Yeah.

01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:03.800
Wow.

01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:04.800
There you go.

01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:09.160
But that's going to be 100 songs playable in UltraMix from the start.

01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:10.160
Crazy.

01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:11.160
Alright.

01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:12.760
Thank you, Konami.

01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:13.760
We love you.

01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:18.120
And there's going to be inside that 14 Konami original DDR songs, so we kind of saw some

01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:20.480
of those, Star Mine and all that stuff.

01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:22.800
So that's going to be very interesting.

01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:24.680
Very, very interesting.

01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:27.640
But they are going to have this downloadable edits thing, which I'm kind of curious how

01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:28.640
that's going to work.

01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:31.840
If like anybody can submit edits, or if they're going to have some kind of screening process

01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:34.200
where they only take like good edits or what they're going to do.

01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:35.200
It'll be very interesting.

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:38.240
Oh, and Panda, I do believe the Xbox is region coded.

01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:39.240
Is it?

01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:42.960
Yes, I do believe it is.

01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:45.440
Very interesting.

01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:48.080
I'm kind of excited to see this mix now.

01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:51.860
I know it's been difficult in the past to get excited about anything Xbox, but boy they're

01:06:51.860 --> 01:06:57.380
really doing DDR right on there I say I'm looking forward to it how about you

01:06:57.380 --> 01:07:00.620
Jamie what do you think about this UltraMix 2 so far this is just so far

01:07:00.620 --> 01:07:04.340
get it we still haven't heard everything about it yet what I'm gonna get it you

01:07:04.340 --> 01:07:08.460
know I'll have it even if I played or not I have UltraMix 1 that have you

01:07:08.460 --> 01:07:12.900
know my UltraMix 1 is unopened really it is because I never had time because

01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:17.060
by the time I got around to playing it I was doing other things well at least you

01:07:17.060 --> 01:07:20.780
bought it oh yeah I have it I have that dance pad everything but it'll give me a

01:07:20.780 --> 01:07:27.780
a good excuse to break it out and start downloading the song packs.

01:07:50.780 --> 01:07:53.780
Sounds like something you'll go over to somebody else's house and play?

01:07:53.780 --> 01:07:54.780
Yeah.

01:07:54.780 --> 01:07:56.780
Alright, fair enough.

01:07:56.780 --> 01:07:58.780
What about you, Angel?

01:07:58.780 --> 01:08:05.780
Maybe, but I'm afraid that if I ever decided to get one, Magus would kill me.

01:08:05.780 --> 01:08:07.780
He just has this thing against Xbox, I guess.

01:08:07.780 --> 01:08:09.780
But it's CDR, he'll get over it.

01:08:09.780 --> 01:08:11.780
Yeah, he should get over it because he's a Halo addict.

01:08:11.780 --> 01:08:13.780
There you go, so you can play Halo on it, too.

01:08:13.780 --> 01:08:18.780
Okay, you know what? I want to know how his opinion should affect you buying something you want.

01:08:18.780 --> 01:08:21.460
Ooh, slam.

01:08:21.460 --> 01:08:24.580
I guess you could get over it.

01:08:24.580 --> 01:08:26.260
So maybe I will.

01:08:26.260 --> 01:08:27.660
I don't know.

01:08:27.660 --> 01:08:28.980
Damn straight he'll get over it.

01:08:28.980 --> 01:08:31.580
If you want an Xbox, you should get an Xbox.

01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:32.500
He'll just have to live.

01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:34.180
Interesting comment from the chat room.

01:08:34.180 --> 01:08:35.980
And I'm not sure if I'm reading too far into this.

01:08:35.980 --> 01:08:38.040
But truthfully, it's going to be only those

01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:40.380
that don't know about the Sims that will get the Xbox,

01:08:40.380 --> 01:08:41.380
says John Fields.

01:08:41.380 --> 01:08:42.760
The others will download the steps

01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:44.300
that they have for every mix.

01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:46.100
But again, I go back to what I said earlier.

01:08:46.100 --> 01:08:50.100
step mania is not ddr

01:08:50.100 --> 01:08:53.100
and i don't think the step mania is going to have

01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:54.100
xbox live

01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:56.420
it doesn't have xbox live

01:08:56.420 --> 01:08:59.340
it does not have xbox live

01:08:59.340 --> 01:09:00.940
but but that ok but there

01:09:00.940 --> 01:09:05.940
they're saying rumor is that they're going to have an internet thing whatever

01:09:05.940 --> 01:09:08.100
i know that's what i said

01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:11.740
do they have step mania online already i've never seen you play it

01:09:11.740 --> 01:09:13.460
because i just don't care

01:09:13.460 --> 01:09:15.460
But they already have step mania online

01:09:17.740 --> 01:09:20.780
Well, I don't know I'm still I couldn't get that stupid thing to work

01:09:22.940 --> 01:09:28.380
Working on it. I just I think the person looks like is already up. I think the percentage

01:09:29.620 --> 01:09:31.620
Did you say X likes live?

01:09:32.660 --> 01:09:37.660
I just think it's such a small percentage of people that would that would opt out of

01:09:37.860 --> 01:09:39.180
Ultramix to for step me

01:09:39.180 --> 01:09:43.140
I think that's why Konami hasn't sued the pants off a step mania yet is because it's gonna be such a small

01:09:43.140 --> 01:09:48.640
or percentage of people that it's really negligent. Remember the DDR community that you see online

01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:53.040
and in chatrooms and stuff is not the scope of the DDR community as a whole.

01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:56.940
And there's going to be people who go, oh look it's another game for the Xbox that's

01:09:56.940 --> 01:10:02.280
going to get my, you know, couch potato kid off of his ass. You know, I've talked to plenty

01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:07.500
of parents, you know, who go into, you know, Gamestop and say, oh well this is going to

01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:09.380
keep my kid from being, you know, lazy.

01:10:09.380 --> 01:10:13.380
All right, I'm actually going to open up the Skype line because I'm curious what some folks

01:10:13.380 --> 01:10:15.560
out there think about UltraMix 2.

01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:19.020
I especially like to hear from people who are contemplating buying an Xbox over this

01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:21.600
whole thing and so we'll open up that Skype line.

01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:26.880
If you want to call us, we have some information on our website, but just go to Skype.org and

01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:28.040
download the client there.

01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:29.040
It's a free client.

01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:30.040
It's a free program.

01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:34.480
All you have to have, you have to have a broadband connection and a microphone and just add Orange

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:38.480

call us live on the show we'll talk to you so we're gonna open up the skype line

01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:44.360

I am.

01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:11.760
Oh, he's disguising his voice because he doesn't want his friends to find out he listens to this show.

01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:16.760
Don't be embarrassed. We won't bite. Much.

01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:20.760
What do you think about UltraMix 2?

01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:22.760
It's okay.

01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:23.760
It's okay?

01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:24.760
Yeah.

01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:28.760
Was there any songs that you're getting really excited about that you're going to be able to play?

01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:30.760
Moonlight Fucking Shadow.

01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:33.280
moonlight fucking shadow is the word hey

01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:36.340

01:12:00.820 --> 01:12:01.820
No, you do not.

01:12:01.820 --> 01:12:02.820
Are you thinking about getting one?

01:12:02.820 --> 01:12:03.820
Yes, I am.

01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:05.460
That is obsession.

01:12:05.460 --> 01:12:07.460
Just because of Moonlight Shadow?

01:12:07.460 --> 01:12:08.460
Yeah.

01:12:08.460 --> 01:12:10.380
Now, that is an obsession.

01:12:10.380 --> 01:12:11.380
That is definitely an obsession.

01:12:11.380 --> 01:12:13.980
You could get one of the nifty green Halo ones.

01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:14.980
That's what I bought.

01:12:14.980 --> 01:12:15.980
Oh, there you go.

01:12:15.980 --> 01:12:17.600
If you like us, have a green one.

01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:19.820
They don't make them in hot pink erotic flavor yet.

01:12:19.820 --> 01:12:20.820
Damn it.

01:12:20.820 --> 01:12:21.820
Maybe soon.

01:12:21.820 --> 01:12:24.660
Okay, I don't think that erotic flavor would be hot pink.

01:12:24.660 --> 01:12:26.340
I think it would be blood red or something.

01:12:26.340 --> 01:12:27.340
It would be sex.

01:12:27.340 --> 01:12:29.340
It would be milky colored.

01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:31.340
It would be like purple.

01:12:31.340 --> 01:12:33.340
We have to clarify something for folks in our chat room because people are going,

01:12:33.340 --> 01:12:36.340
Wait a minute, Moonlight Shadow is an erotic song?

01:12:36.340 --> 01:12:39.340
Actually, do you want to explain this one unknown game or you want me to?

01:12:39.340 --> 01:12:43.340
Do you want me to explain it with the way my microphone sounds right now?

01:12:43.340 --> 01:12:45.340
Okay, yeah, you're right. I better explain it.

01:12:45.340 --> 01:12:53.340
Alright, so the reason why Moonlight Shadow is tied to erotic is that actually the old lead singer from erotic

01:12:53.340 --> 01:12:57.980
went and she joined this new band called missing heart she kind of went off on

01:12:57.980 --> 01:13:01.940
her own and did this missing heart so that's why it gets tied back to erotic a

01:13:01.940 --> 01:13:04.940
lot because it's the same vocalist that you hear in a lot of the old erotic

01:13:04.940 --> 01:13:10.420
songs so that's why moonlight shadow it kind of has ties to erotic it's just

01:13:10.420 --> 01:13:14.580
but the only difference is that she's not going carried away by a moonlight

01:13:14.580 --> 01:13:43.580
I'm gonna type to you the story of what happened and then you just tell people what happened.

01:13:43.580 --> 01:13:47.040
typing it to me and I'm gonna tell people what happened so I'm gonna wait

01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:50.540
for that. And I'm gonna work on getting a microphone that doesn't suck. All right you do

01:13:50.540 --> 01:13:55.800
that and then you call us back. Yeah. But thanks for calling us. Oh I like that. You

01:13:55.800 --> 01:14:05.600
have a good one. You too. Bye bye. I need dessert. I want dessert. I have some diverse system

01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:10.440
seven tracks I would like to play. What no wait we have to wait for those

01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:13.100
because we're getting another call real fast. No I'm gonna take this call.

01:14:13.100 --> 01:14:15.100
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:14:17.100 --> 01:14:18.100
Hello.

01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:19.100
Hello.

01:14:19.100 --> 01:14:21.100
He wants some ZZ7 tracks.

01:14:21.100 --> 01:14:22.100
He does not want to...

01:14:22.100 --> 01:14:23.100
Can you...

01:14:23.100 --> 01:14:24.100
We cannot hear you.

01:14:24.100 --> 01:14:25.100
Please speak up.

01:14:26.100 --> 01:14:27.100
Aww, bummer.

01:14:27.100 --> 01:14:30.100
Uh, call us back when you get your mic thing rearranged.

01:14:30.100 --> 01:14:31.100
Yeah.

01:14:31.100 --> 01:14:32.100
Alright.

01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:33.100
That's too bad.

01:14:33.100 --> 01:14:34.100
Okay, hold on.

01:14:34.100 --> 01:14:35.100
I'm getting the story with Moonlight Shadow here.

01:14:37.100 --> 01:14:38.100
Oh, I thought I was.

01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:41.100
Alright, we'll get that.

01:14:41.100 --> 01:14:42.100
Alright, fine.

01:14:42.100 --> 01:14:44.100
No, I don't want to.

01:15:12.100 --> 01:15:18.580
different, but it's pretty cool nonetheless. Anyways, here we go.

01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:28.400
Oops, gotta take that off there. Okay. Anyways, the next one, real quick, is a Trip Machine

01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:34.680
Dark Core mix, and my God, I have to say, this is for Trip Machine what P8107 was for

01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:41.680
paranoia. So, it's gonna be fucking awesome, that's all I gotta say.

01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:10.380
Two things to love, two things to destroy

01:17:11.380 --> 01:17:15.380
Two things to love, two things to destroy

01:17:17.380 --> 01:17:22.180
Two things to love, two things to destroy

01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:27.880
Two things to love, two things to destroy

01:17:28.380 --> 01:17:32.880
Two things to love, two things to destroy

01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:48.520
Okay, and then, um, one that's really cool, I don't really know what exactly this is,

01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:53.480
it's um, it says it's Reality Alpha 0.2 mix, it sounds like what it is, it's just a bunch

01:17:53.480 --> 01:17:57.920
of different songs kind of mixed in the one, which is still kind of cool, but um, it's

01:17:57.920 --> 01:18:04.920
it's pretty hardcore so check it out

01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:29.920
Go!

01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:32.920
Go!

01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:34.920
I will take it!

01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:36.920
Yeah!

01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:38.920
Yeah!

01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:51.920
I'll take it!

01:18:51.920 --> 01:19:09.800
Ok, so that was a few of those.

01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:13.440
So if they want to order this album of all these Bhumani remixes, although we'll be playing

01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:18.280
them on Diversions Monday night, where can they go to order the CD?

01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:32.280
Well, Diverse Systems, that's www.diverse.jp, I don't think they're up for sale yet. I think, usually they have their own English page, which, you know, they sell most of their CDs, but it's not on there yet.

01:19:32.280 --> 01:19:44.280
So, I remember before, they did wait a little bit before they were available for the US. I don't know, you know, whether they're getting, you know, taking care of the Japanese first or whatnot.

01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:49.160
there's I don't know when exactly these are going to be up right now it's

01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:54.960
checking right now you can purchase them they have a few links on the right hand

01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:59.000
side where you can purchase them from and I don't know why they're selling them

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:05.080
there dojinshi sites so you can get those there but right now available from

01:20:05.080 --> 01:20:11.200
their site they don't have them yet so I'm looking to see right now if it's on

01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:17.860
their ordering page no actually it is on their Japanese ordering page but not in

01:20:17.860 --> 01:20:22.140
their English ordering page you might be able to I don't know you can Mike might

01:20:22.140 --> 01:20:25.140
be able to send them an email or something if you can not speak Japanese

01:20:25.140 --> 01:20:31.340
but right now yeah and it's gonna be three different CDs they're all press

01:20:31.340 --> 01:20:37.820
CDs gonna be about 15 bucks apiece that's a d7 five keys d7 seven keys and

01:20:37.820 --> 01:20:44.160
D7 other mixture. So definitely look for those and I will be getting those as soon as I can

01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:45.160
order them.

01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:49.760
Alright, I was going to open the Skype line back up because our caller wanted to call

01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:52.840
back because he had something he wanted to share with us. So we're going to open back

01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:58.960
up that Skype line there so you can call us if you want. Skype.org to download the client.

01:20:58.960 --> 01:21:02.380
And pretty soon we're going to be going to break here and in the break we'll be hearing

01:21:02.380 --> 01:21:06.660
some songs that are going to be in UltraMix 2. Some of those port overs from 2DX. So

01:21:06.660 --> 01:21:09.660
For those of you guys that haven't heard the songs yet, can I have a chance to hear them?

01:21:09.660 --> 01:21:12.660
Because, you know, we want you to be able to hear the songs.

01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:14.660
Alright, let's take this call.

01:21:14.660 --> 01:21:17.660
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:21:17.660 --> 01:21:19.660
Hello there, Rob. Hello, everybody.

01:21:19.660 --> 01:21:22.660
Hello, this is Mr. VXJsonXV, is it not?

01:21:22.660 --> 01:21:24.660
You would be correct, sir.

01:21:24.660 --> 01:21:25.660
How are you doing, sir?

01:21:25.660 --> 01:21:26.660
I'm doing pretty good.

01:21:26.660 --> 01:21:29.660
Alright, what did you want to talk to us with about UltraMix II?

01:21:29.660 --> 01:21:33.660
I basically wanted to add in something about how the song packs are going to work.

01:21:33.660 --> 01:21:38.660
Um, for all of you that have UltraMix already and have gotten the song packs and didn't know this,

01:21:38.660 --> 01:21:42.660
basically what's gonna happen is if you have the song packs purchased and downloaded,

01:21:42.660 --> 01:21:45.660
when you fire up UltraMix 2, it's just gonna work.

01:21:45.660 --> 01:21:48.660
They're gonna be on the list, you're gonna play them, it's gonna be beautiful.

01:21:48.660 --> 01:21:50.660
The only catch is...

01:21:50.660 --> 01:21:52.660
It's plug and play.

01:21:52.660 --> 01:21:53.660
What was that?

01:21:53.660 --> 01:21:54.660
It's plug and play.

01:21:54.660 --> 01:21:56.660
It is plug and play.

01:21:56.660 --> 01:22:00.660
Um, what's gonna happen though is that the videos are gonna be different.

01:22:00.660 --> 01:22:05.960
You know, obviously UltraMix is going to cycle video content, but Order of Chaos on DDRFreak

01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:11.840
said that there's going to be exclusive videos, brand new videos for those songs now on UltraMix

01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:12.840
2.

01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:13.840
Really?

01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:17.320
So basically the media is going to be already on the DVD, but the steps and, you know, actually

01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:20.620
showing up is going to be off your hard drive for downloading the content.

01:22:20.620 --> 01:22:27.120
I've heard rumors that there's going to be a lot of new videos in UltraMix 2.

01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:28.120
That's what they're pushing for.

01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:32.120
I don't know how much I can say, but I hear that there's a lot of new videos on Ultramix 2.

01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:36.120
That if you're wanting to see some new videos, Ultramix 2 is going to give you plenty.

01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:38.120
Yeah, that'd be shitty.

01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:39.120
We'll see.

01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:45.120
Yep. And then you can, you will still be able to buy the first six song packs on Ultramix 2.

01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:50.120
The only catch is if you do that, you can only use them for Ultramix 2 and not for the first one.

01:22:50.120 --> 01:22:55.120
Oh, interesting. So if you're smart, you'll buy your packs on Ultramix 1 now.

01:22:55.120 --> 01:23:05.120
That is what I want to do, because there's no word yet if the song packs are going to be removed from purchase for UltraMix 1, I'm hoping not, so I can get them too, but you know.

01:23:05.120 --> 01:23:07.120
Do you actually have UltraMix 1 right now?

01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:09.120
No, I don't even have an Xbox.

01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:11.120
Is UltraMix 2 making you change your mind here?

01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:20.120
I've wanted to get one for a while, I've just never really had a good amount of incentive, but this is definitely making me want one even more now.

01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:24.120
So you're telling me that Jets Already a Future was not enough?

01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:28.120
I never played the first one, it was in...

01:23:28.120 --> 01:23:29.120
Halo 2?

01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:33.120
Well now that you can get, if you get your Xbox you should also get Jets Already a Future since it's cheap now.

01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:35.120
Sure, why not? It's a good game.

01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:37.120
And the Buffy game.

01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:39.120
The Buffy game.

01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:41.120
Okay, Buffy, yeah.

01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:46.120
Alright Jason, when you get your Xbox we're going to have a battle on Xbox Live, alright?

01:23:46.120 --> 01:23:47.120
Sounds awesome.

01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:50.120
I'm gonna serve you on Xbox Live.

01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:53.120
Oh no! Oh no!

01:23:53.120 --> 01:24:00.120
I'm actually thinking about this. I don't know. I'm gonna kind of put some feelers out in the chat room and kind of see what you guys think about this.

01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:06.120
What would you guys think about starting up some kind of Sunday night Ultramix League? Like right after the show.

01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:10.120
We all jump on Xbox Live and play. I would do it. I'll even jump on there and play.

01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:12.120
Orange Lounge DR team?

01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:17.600
Yeah, it'll be well. It'll be like our Sunday night. You know ultra mix night like post show thing

01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:22.280
I don't know how many people would be enough or if that's like way too dorky for you guys. I don't know

01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:28.760
If I don't know if it brings people together and gets them gets us some good playtime in

01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:32.140
Sounds good by me cuz I've actually been on Xbox Live after the show

01:24:32.140 --> 01:24:36.880
There's um some a couple well at least one person in our chat room that sometimes likes to get on there and play

01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:41.780
play different songs after the show sometimes. So I'm thinking, why not expand it and get

01:24:41.780 --> 01:24:44.680
a lot of people on there? It might be kind of fun. So we'll see.

01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:48.120
I've heard that people that are getting on live, that there's very few people that play

01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:51.180
on live anymore. Well, anymore. But think about when the first

01:24:51.180 --> 01:24:53.560
game came out, too. That's true.

01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:57.560
You know, it's almost a year old now. Of course there's not a lot of people still on Xbox

01:24:57.560 --> 01:24:59.460
Live. But, hey, that's the thing, is that we want

01:24:59.460 --> 01:25:03.780
to start something up, too. Let's start it. Let's get old so it makes, it's kind of like

01:25:03.780 --> 01:25:07.620
and I love the 90s thing. Remember when the old stuff was cool? Remember when UltraMix

01:25:07.620 --> 01:25:11.020
was cool? Kind of bringing it back. So let's see.

01:25:11.020 --> 01:25:15.180
I've been playing new songs. Everybody's going to come back around. Those numbers are going

01:25:15.180 --> 01:25:17.580
to shoot up the day that UltraMix 2 come out.

01:25:17.580 --> 01:25:21.420
I think so too. Another thing a lot of people don't consider when they're playing UltraMix

01:25:21.420 --> 01:25:28.020
on Xbox Live is that it doesn't show you everybody that's playing. It only shows you who's looking

01:25:28.020 --> 01:25:32.380
for a game right now. So when you're in the lobby looking for people to play, the folks

01:25:32.380 --> 01:25:36.680
that are already having a match, or are having private matches, you don't see them because

01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:40.020
they're already playing the game. So even though it only looks like there's one or two

01:25:40.020 --> 01:25:45.580
people on, there's probably at least ten. Which for a game that's a year old, it's DDR,

01:25:45.580 --> 01:25:52.660
probably isn't that bad. Yeah. Interesting. Very interesting. Alright. Alright. Anything

01:25:52.660 --> 01:25:57.000
else you want to share about UltraMix stuff, Jason? Somebody should buy me an Xbox and

01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:00.420
all the song packs and a live subscription for a few years, because I don't have money

01:26:00.420 --> 01:26:04.260
yet and I have bills to pay but well I'm sure that's the same boat a lot of

01:26:04.260 --> 01:26:07.140
folks are in maybe they'll drop the price of an Xbox again not likely but

01:26:07.140 --> 01:26:11.140
you never know hopefully what are they right now 150 175 I think 150 but you

01:26:11.140 --> 01:26:16.260
could get a refurbed one at that is very true places for 120 130 you know what

01:26:16.260 --> 01:26:19.860
say version ones are a lot better anyways I have I have the super halo

01:26:19.860 --> 01:26:23.380
ones so I don't know I might you know you can hack them if you have a memory

01:26:23.380 --> 01:26:29.260
stick yep I have heard there's plenty of you have to use the first release of

01:26:29.260 --> 01:26:31.160
of like uh... mecha-salt

01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:34.420

01:26:53.480 --> 01:26:54.820
uh...

01:26:54.820 --> 01:26:58.820
i'm serious about this xbox live thing after the show i think it would be fun

01:26:58.820 --> 01:27:01.380
Would you guys play?

01:27:01.380 --> 01:27:04.540
I'm eating making pouty faces and blinking my eyelashes.

01:27:04.540 --> 01:27:09.020
On Sunday? Now wait a minute Loki, with Ultramix 2 multiple people can

01:27:09.020 --> 01:27:11.820
play for one Xbox so you and I could both play

01:27:11.820 --> 01:27:12.660
on the Ultramix.

01:27:12.660 --> 01:27:14.140
Wow, really?

01:27:14.140 --> 01:27:17.600
Don't say, don't care.

01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:20.260
I'll play Final Fantasy 11.

01:27:20.260 --> 01:27:21.780
Jerk, jerk.

01:27:21.780 --> 01:27:25.220
Yes Angel. Screw it, I'm gonna twist Magus's arm and make him

01:27:25.220 --> 01:27:30.220
But don't worry, those demons that come through my demonic vortex can play with you.

01:27:30.220 --> 01:27:37.220
Wonderful. Now some folks in the chat room are saying we should do it before the show, but...

01:27:37.220 --> 01:27:40.220
After the show would be too late, because honestly, I'm driving home.

01:27:40.220 --> 01:27:41.220
Yeah.

01:27:41.220 --> 01:27:47.220
And keep in mind, I also work an earlier schedule now. I have to get up at 5.30 in the morning to go to work.

01:27:47.220 --> 01:27:50.220
Well, I'll have to think. I don't know. We'll see.

01:27:50.220 --> 01:27:51.220
Because my ass is going to school.

01:27:51.220 --> 01:27:54.580
time for me personally like I have to get my Sunday stuff done before the show

01:27:54.580 --> 01:27:58.660
so I don't know we'll see well but how about a different night

01:27:58.660 --> 01:28:03.860
no that might work too yeah set up for a different night you know probably I'm

01:28:03.860 --> 01:28:06.500
gonna be going home busting my ass to get my homework done too yeah there you

01:28:06.500 --> 01:28:09.420
go yeah we'll see what we can do if there's an interest for doing something

01:28:09.420 --> 01:28:13.500
like that we'll set something up we'll see yeah soon as I tell Magus what songs

01:28:13.500 --> 01:28:19.300
are on the new UltraMix 2 he'll probably get one maybe we're not even we haven't

01:28:19.300 --> 01:28:23.260
even really we've only heard like one new license song brick house by

01:28:23.260 --> 01:28:26.420
Commodores we haven't even heard about any of the other stuff and there might

01:28:26.420 --> 01:28:30.460
be some really good stuff that's good I would just play it for the Commodore

01:28:30.460 --> 01:28:37.300
song that's an inside joke between the pixie dust and I so yeah we'll see we'll

01:28:37.300 --> 01:28:41.020
see all right what we're gonna do now actually I think we'll go ahead and take

01:28:41.020 --> 01:28:44.480
a break and we're gonna play those songs from Ultramix 2 that are being ported

01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:48.800
over from 2dx so in this break you're gonna hear route 80s star mine and

01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:54.160
and VJ Army. So we'll be back right after this. You are tuned into Orange Lounge

01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:54.760
Radio.

01:28:54.760 --> 01:28:58.020
After the break we might get into the cage match I think. We need to do that at

01:28:58.020 --> 01:28:58.600
some point

01:28:58.600 --> 01:29:02.320
and so much more as soon as we can think of it.

01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:04.320
Alright, we'll be back.

01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:43.920

Why?

01:33:42.580 --> 01:33:58.580
Steppin' into the groove of it Steppin' into the groove of it

01:33:58.580 --> 01:34:20.540
Hey, did you hear about that show?

01:34:20.540 --> 01:34:21.540
What show?

01:34:21.540 --> 01:34:24.660
Well, they play a lot of great Samani and video of East End music, but if you listen

01:34:24.660 --> 01:34:26.820
to it, you have to listen to it again within seven days.

01:34:26.820 --> 01:34:28.540
Oh, I've heard of that station.

01:34:28.540 --> 01:34:33.540
Yeah, I even listened to it a couple weeks ago. Hey, what happens to you if you don't listen to it again?

01:34:33.540 --> 01:34:35.540
Well, you die.

01:34:35.540 --> 01:34:42.540
I what? Hey, wait! What's this crazy bitch doing coming out of my computer screen? Ahhhhh!

01:34:42.540 --> 01:34:46.540
Orange Lounge Radio, listen or die!

01:34:49.540 --> 01:34:55.540
We are back with Orange Lounge Radio. Now we're talking before the break a little bit about UltraMix 2.

01:34:55.540 --> 01:35:01.420
too. Not to leave it out, but DDR Extreme is going to be coming out very soon, just

01:35:01.420 --> 01:35:06.260
before we know it. We're about a month away, just a little over a month away from DDR Extreme

01:35:06.260 --> 01:35:09.820
coming out, so that's kind of crazy. And we'll probably start hearing a little more news

01:35:09.820 --> 01:35:14.460
on it, including we got a couple weeks ago, and we kind of missed it when we were talking

01:35:14.460 --> 01:35:19.240
about last week, we were talking about some of the other stuff dealing with DDR Extreme

01:35:19.240 --> 01:35:24.480
last week, but we kind of glossed over the iToy modes. There's actually like some brand

01:35:54.480 --> 01:36:00.560
You know what I think is cool though is that for working out purposes the itoy thing is cool

01:36:00.720 --> 01:36:05.800
Like that's the only reason I would use it. Is that hands of heat mode too? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah

01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:13.080
And then they have that feed the animals game which I haven't really seen a whole lot about but it looks very interesting

01:36:13.080 --> 01:36:14.760
That's for sure

01:36:14.760 --> 01:36:19.660
That's the one where you're gonna step on the different food and you feed it to the animal that's on the screen

01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:22.240
It's crazy

01:36:22.240 --> 01:36:24.240
Very crazy.

01:36:24.240 --> 01:36:27.240
Trying to find some more information about some of these modes.

01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:31.240
What else do we have? We have the Hyper Dash, which looks like the old school track and field,

01:36:31.240 --> 01:36:34.240
which I have no idea how that's going to work with the iToy.

01:36:34.240 --> 01:36:38.240
I think it might actually just be using the dance pad, where you're just going to run in place, like all,

01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:43.240
every single old school Nintendo Power Pad game was just like running in place as fast as you can.

01:36:43.240 --> 01:36:45.240
And that was your workout, remember?

01:36:45.240 --> 01:36:52.240
Dance Aerobics

01:37:15.240 --> 01:37:17.240
magical ball

01:37:17.740 --> 01:37:19.940
You can show Konami your magical balls

01:37:22.940 --> 01:37:26.580
I'm definitely looking forward to feeding time. I think that's going to be a very cool one

01:37:27.100 --> 01:37:30.480
For those of you that may have missed it. We'll link you guys again to that story

01:37:31.180 --> 01:37:37.460
Over on yahoo games domain, which is hilarious because they talk about it being for the Xbox. It's really funny. So

01:37:38.340 --> 01:37:40.340
Definitely check that one out

01:37:40.340 --> 01:37:48.340
So that's pretty much all I have to say about DDR Extreme. Have you guys pre-ordered your DDR Extreme yet?

01:37:48.340 --> 01:37:54.340
That might be the only way you can get that VRare. Everybody looks so enthused.

01:37:54.340 --> 01:37:59.340
I'll have to order it. Then again, my man does manage a webcam.

01:37:59.340 --> 01:38:03.340
A webcam? What kind of business is your man in?

01:38:03.340 --> 01:38:08.340
I was typing webcam on the thing. It's GameStop.

01:38:08.340 --> 01:38:09.340
You sure?

01:38:09.340 --> 01:38:10.340
Yes.

01:38:10.340 --> 01:38:11.340
Rob.

01:38:11.340 --> 01:38:12.340
What?

01:38:12.340 --> 01:38:13.340
Rob.

01:38:13.340 --> 01:38:14.340
What?

01:38:14.340 --> 01:38:15.340
What?

01:38:15.340 --> 01:38:16.340
Rob.

01:38:16.340 --> 01:38:17.340
What?

01:38:17.340 --> 01:38:18.340
Bite me.

01:38:18.340 --> 01:38:19.340
Okay.

01:38:19.340 --> 01:38:20.340
Alright.

01:38:20.340 --> 01:38:29.700
Well, I guess if no one has anything else to say on the DDR Extreme, why don't we just

01:38:29.700 --> 01:38:31.380
go ahead and have ourselves a cage match?

01:38:31.380 --> 01:38:32.380
How's that sound?

01:38:32.380 --> 01:38:33.380
Sure.

01:38:33.380 --> 01:38:34.380
Alright.

01:38:34.380 --> 01:38:35.380
We'll do it.

01:38:35.380 --> 01:38:36.380
I got to be lazy today.

01:38:36.380 --> 01:38:37.380
What do you mean, you got to be lazy?

01:38:37.380 --> 01:38:39.380
What do you mean you have to be lazy today?

01:38:39.380 --> 01:38:41.380
I'd have to bring one.

01:38:41.380 --> 01:38:43.380
That's right, because you won last week, didn't you?

01:38:43.380 --> 01:38:44.380
Uh-huh.

01:38:44.380 --> 01:38:45.380
That's right.

01:38:45.380 --> 01:38:46.380
Finally.

01:38:46.380 --> 01:38:49.380
Alright, so just as a reminder, the way the cage match works...

01:38:49.380 --> 01:38:53.380
You have to be in our chat room at www.orangelauntrader.com.

01:38:53.380 --> 01:38:54.380
Click on chat.

01:38:54.380 --> 01:38:56.380
We're going to play three songs for you guys.

01:38:56.380 --> 01:39:01.380
A clip of last week's winner, because, you know, you were listening last week, so you've already heard it.

01:39:01.380 --> 01:39:03.380
So we're only going to play a clip of it.

01:39:03.380 --> 01:39:09.380
And then we'll hear two new songs brought to the table from each host, and you will vote on your favorite.

01:39:09.380 --> 01:39:15.380
And the winner goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's...

01:39:15.380 --> 01:39:22.380
I'm sorry, Orange Lounge Radio's the Monty Music and More program, which plays on the station 24 hours a day, 7 days a week when we aren't live.

01:39:22.380 --> 01:39:32.380
Alright, so here we go. Last week's winner was Jamie, and she brought to the table a song by M-Flow, which you know from old school DDR games and 2DX.

01:39:32.380 --> 01:39:36.280
so uh... this is their new album from their new album it's a song called

01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:37.560
astro sexy

01:39:37.560 --> 01:39:41.100
chemistry and it's last week's winner and so here's a clip of it

01:39:41.100 --> 01:39:44.360
so you can decide if you want it to win again tonight song number one m flow

01:39:44.360 --> 01:39:45.360
So astro-sexy

01:42:14.360 --> 01:42:21.360
and

01:42:26.520 --> 01:42:29.560
alright over the clip song number one in tonight's cage match

01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:33.560
m flow with astro-sexy alright the next pick

01:42:33.560 --> 01:42:36.600
in tonight's cage match the first challenger comes from

01:42:36.600 --> 01:42:39.680
our very own loki loki what did you pick for tonight's cage match

01:42:39.680 --> 01:42:43.500
i picked a song bro i don't know it from

01:42:43.500 --> 01:42:51.700
It's, they said it was from Outfaze, I don't think it's from Outfaze, but it's called Nuon.

01:42:54.200 --> 01:43:01.800
So this is one of those songs where somebody has decided they are going to say it's from Outfaze, even though they have no particular proof of this, right?

01:43:02.800 --> 01:43:03.700
Exactly.

01:43:03.900 --> 01:43:06.100
But you liked it anyway, so you're putting it in a cage match.

01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:07.800
That and I just don't care.

01:43:08.200 --> 01:43:10.600
Alright. Fair enough. So here it is.

01:43:10.600 --> 01:43:19.440
An unknown group that we're going to call Not Outfades, maybe somebody will recognize

01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:21.720
this and help us out, who knows.

01:43:21.720 --> 01:43:26.520
And the song is called Nuon, and this is Loki's pick in Night's Cage Match.

01:43:26.520 --> 01:43:28.520
Enjoy!

01:46:56.520 --> 01:46:58.520
Oh

01:47:26.520 --> 01:47:45.720
All right, that was song number two in tonight's cage match, a group that they are saying is

01:47:45.720 --> 01:47:48.760
out phase, but we're kind of skeptical at this point.

01:47:48.760 --> 01:47:52.360
But Nuon is the song, and both of you liked it so much, you put it in tonight's cage match.

01:47:52.360 --> 01:47:53.360
What did the rest of us think?

01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:54.360
Jamie?

01:47:54.360 --> 01:47:55.360
That doesn't sound like any out phase to me.

01:47:55.360 --> 01:47:59.760
And it did not detect the presence of Taku in that.

01:47:59.760 --> 01:48:01.480
And I would know.

01:48:01.480 --> 01:48:04.600
Because some people have various types of radar.

01:48:04.600 --> 01:48:07.360
I have Takudar.

01:48:07.360 --> 01:48:09.000
And it didn't go off.

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.160
It didn't even blink.

01:48:11.160 --> 01:48:15.840
So it sounds pretty generic in Japan, honestly, to me.

01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:18.520
So it gets a seven for being average.

01:48:18.520 --> 01:48:20.960
All right, seven for being average from Jamie.

01:48:20.960 --> 01:48:24.520
DDR Angel, what did you think of Nuon?

01:48:24.520 --> 01:48:35.520
I thought it was pretty good, I mean, pretty good for like background music if you need to do your homework, or something, you know, if you're just playing around, photo editing, or whatever.

01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:39.520
Um, I'd probably say... an eight and a half.

01:48:40.520 --> 01:48:41.520
Arcadian 42.

01:48:41.520 --> 01:48:44.520
Yeah, yeah, I still see how that sounds.

01:48:44.520 --> 01:48:46.520
It sounded way too generic for me.

01:48:46.520 --> 01:48:48.520
It wasn't too bad, I'd give it a 7.5.

01:48:48.520 --> 01:48:49.520
Alright, Loki.

01:48:50.520 --> 01:48:51.520
Take it to Nate.

01:48:51.520 --> 01:49:01.520
If that is out phase, it's very generic and very sad direction for them, so I remain highly skeptical as to that being out phase.

01:49:01.520 --> 01:49:07.520
It's a little generic, but it's not bad. I've just heard better trance, so I give it a 7.

01:49:07.520 --> 01:49:14.520
Alright, but our opinions don't count, it's you in the chatroom that has a final say, and now you get my pick in tonight's Page Match.

01:49:14.520 --> 01:49:21.200
Cage match and I am I'm being very adventurous tonight because I I haven't

01:49:21.200 --> 01:49:25.880
even completely heard the song I'm putting in ever I heard it at the club

01:49:25.880 --> 01:49:30.900
the other night and then I downloaded it and now I'm putting it in and I have no

01:49:30.900 --> 01:49:34.720
idea if I even like this song as much as I thought I did but I'm kind of

01:49:34.720 --> 01:49:40.200
desperate and I like the fact that it's another old song being resampled so

01:49:40.200 --> 01:49:45.220
So enjoy my pick in tonight's cage match, it's a group called the Royal Jigglos, which

01:49:45.220 --> 01:49:46.960
you know you gotta love them by the name alone.

01:49:46.960 --> 01:49:49.960
And the song they're doing is California Dreamin', enjoy.

01:49:49.960 --> 01:50:04.960
Hold me my sweet, hold me now, hold me God, and I shout, the sound of the storm, a portal,

01:50:04.960 --> 01:50:06.960
I channelled through time

01:50:07.460 --> 01:50:09.460
And my senses burned

01:50:10.460 --> 01:50:12.460
The heart broke in life

01:50:12.960 --> 01:50:14.960
The broken hand burned

01:50:14.960 --> 01:50:16.960
How are you?

01:50:16.960 --> 01:50:18.960
How are you?

01:50:18.960 --> 01:50:20.960
Oh

01:50:48.960 --> 01:51:11.320
I am going to heaven for the dream, and I'm not your way to stay.

01:51:11.320 --> 01:51:18.440
I am going to heaven for the dream, and I'm not your way to stay.

01:51:48.440 --> 01:51:50.440
Oh

01:52:18.440 --> 01:52:19.440
I'm such a Wednesday

01:52:19.440 --> 01:52:23.440
I'll be where you are and save the world

01:52:23.440 --> 01:52:27.440
You're all I need, it's all that I need

01:52:27.440 --> 01:52:30.440
No one here is for this reason

01:52:30.440 --> 01:52:35.440
Even if I'm such a Wednesday

01:53:00.440 --> 01:53:20.440
Hold me God, hold me God, hold me, hold me

01:53:20.440 --> 01:53:30.560
All right, that was song number three in tonight's cage match, a song I've never heard before,

01:53:30.560 --> 01:53:34.080
Royal Gigalos with California Dreamin'.

01:53:34.080 --> 01:53:35.080
Jamie?

01:53:35.080 --> 01:53:38.280
You know what?

01:53:38.280 --> 01:53:43.480
That was really, and I understand you, had you heard it through all the way, I'm sure

01:53:43.480 --> 01:53:47.360
you would have reconsidered your choice.

01:53:47.360 --> 01:53:48.360
You know what?

01:53:48.360 --> 01:53:50.200
The mix I heard was actually a little different.

01:53:50.200 --> 01:53:52.160
That one was more repetitive in our mouth.

01:53:52.160 --> 01:53:54.440
I remember it being like, transier, actually.

01:53:54.440 --> 01:53:57.400
I was kind of getting into it at first, because I was like, hey, this is kind of cool.

01:53:57.400 --> 01:53:59.640
And then I was like, ugh.

01:53:59.640 --> 01:54:03.360
And then, the bitches singing, because I don't think it was a sample of the Mombus and the

01:54:03.360 --> 01:54:04.360
Poppers.

01:54:04.360 --> 01:54:05.360
I don't think it was either.

01:54:05.360 --> 01:54:06.360
In the video, it wasn't.

01:54:06.360 --> 01:54:13.400
If you're going to be a professional singer, a requirement is that you hold a key.

01:54:13.400 --> 01:54:25.400
However, there's Politary. However, where I would normally have given that a 4, because of the name of the band, I said I'd give him a bonus points to get a 5.

01:54:25.400 --> 01:54:28.400
Alright. DDR Angel.

01:54:28.400 --> 01:54:37.240
you know what I've actually heard better better keys held by like band newbies

01:54:37.240 --> 01:54:42.840
by band newbies if you've never been in a saxophone class with sixth graders who

01:54:42.840 --> 01:54:47.000
have never played a saxophone before it sounds like cows being beaten to death

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:50.000
Alright, DDR Angel.

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:51.000
Moo.

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:52.000
Okay.

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:58.000
Gee, I don't know.

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
The song was okay.

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:05.000
I mean, it was kind of dancy, it was kind of cool, so...

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:08.000
Maybe I'll be generous and give it an 8.

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:09.000
Alright.

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
A pity point from DDR Angel.

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:12.000
Arcadian!

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:26.000
I'm gonna follow the same guidelines that Dark Sakura gives the song. I'm gonna have to give it a 1.

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.500
Which is the lowest score I've ever given one of my own songs.

01:55:44.500 --> 01:55:47.000
I think that's the lowest score anybody's given their own song.

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:51.000
To quote Muffin Juice, it sounds more like an elephant getting a pineapple shoved up its ass.

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.500
All right. You guys are mean.

01:55:53.500 --> 01:55:54.500
That would be...

01:55:56.000 --> 01:56:00.000
All right. Well, let's see. You know what? The chat room may have felt a little differently than the rest two, right?

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:01.500
I have no way to imitate that.

01:56:01.500 --> 01:56:04.500
And it is up to them to choose between these three songs.

01:56:04.500 --> 01:56:19.460
1. M-Flow – Astro Sexy 2. Not Out Phase – Nuon

01:56:19.460 --> 01:56:24.460
That's a horrible clip. Let's try again.

01:56:24.460 --> 01:56:35.460
Alright, and song number three, Royal Gigalows, California Dreamin'.

01:56:35.460 --> 01:56:36.460
California Dreaming.

01:56:36.460 --> 01:56:53.100
All right, place, vote now.

01:56:53.100 --> 01:56:56.780
Send a private message to Skye in the chat room with your vote.

01:56:56.780 --> 01:57:00.080
Remember, you must send it over private message.

01:57:00.080 --> 01:57:04.860
If you yell it out in the main chat room, you will not only not have your vote counted,

01:57:04.860 --> 01:57:11.860
you will be mocked openly for not listening to the directions. By Jamie. Alright, so uh...

01:57:11.860 --> 01:57:19.180
What else am I here for? But probably mockery. If caning were to be brought back, somehow

01:57:19.180 --> 01:57:24.220
I imagine you would be involved. You would be the administrator. Dude, that'd be cool.

01:57:24.220 --> 01:57:30.940
I still think my opinion is to solve all the world's problems. What? Two methods. Standardized

01:57:30.940 --> 01:57:36.060
test and battle royale all right i seriously think they should take all the inmates put them on an

01:57:36.060 --> 01:57:41.980
island kill who they made a movie out of that with ray leoto is called no escape but they need to

01:57:41.980 --> 01:57:46.140
when they have one left and he thinks he's all winner and going back to become a productive

01:57:46.140 --> 01:57:54.620
member of society then they they sink his boat you guys are horrible televise it new reality tv

01:57:54.620 --> 01:58:01.820
you guys are horrible all right we're gonna take a break pretty soon here

01:58:01.820 --> 01:58:06.780
while we tally up those cage match votes and when we excuse me I burped a little

01:58:06.780 --> 01:58:12.020
bit when we come back from the break we're gonna hear um oh I'm sorry we're

01:58:12.020 --> 01:58:16.300
gonna hear us doing a segment called list lists which we have not done in a

01:58:16.300 --> 01:58:19.540
long long time on the show but we figured you know what we have some time

01:58:19.540 --> 01:58:23.440
to fill we have some new people listening tonight we want to do list

01:58:23.440 --> 01:58:29.560
list and tonight's topic, and this is where we determine on this show the definitive top

01:58:29.560 --> 01:58:33.640
three of something. You know, cause top shows are very popular, like we have the top ten

01:58:33.640 --> 01:58:39.000
games and top ten this, so we here on Orange Lounge Radio are gonna come up with our very

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:46.640
own top three and tonight's topic is iToy game I would most like to see on DDR. So some

01:58:46.640 --> 01:58:49.920
of you guys may have a suggestion out there in the chat room so you might want to type

01:58:49.920 --> 01:58:53.080
those out cause you never know, one of the hosts or the guests might pick that up and

01:58:53.080 --> 01:59:01.560
use it as their suggestion. So we shall see. Meanwhile, I'd actually like to go over some...

01:59:01.560 --> 01:59:08.240
well, we'll do the FUs as well when we come back. But first off, I want to talk about

01:59:08.240 --> 01:59:12.860
some other video game news that came up this week and last week while we were having our

01:59:12.860 --> 01:59:17.640
crazy show. So I just kind of wanted to run over some of that real fast. Xbox is going

01:59:17.640 --> 01:59:22.080
to have a brand new Sonic Mega collection coming out for it. That's going to be pretty

01:59:22.080 --> 01:59:30.560
20 different games, one Xbox, including Sonic, Sonic 3, Sonic Knuckles, Sonic 3D Blast, Sonic

01:59:30.560 --> 01:59:34.360
and Knuckles when you put them together is going to be on there, and a bunch of Game

01:59:34.360 --> 01:59:38.300
Gear titles, and then these other titles that seemingly have nothing to do with Sonic, The

01:59:38.300 --> 01:59:41.840
Ooze, Comic Zone, Flicky, and Ristar.

01:59:41.840 --> 01:59:45.380
You will notice, however, that Sonic CD is not on it.

01:59:45.380 --> 01:59:46.620
You know what?

01:59:46.620 --> 01:59:48.520
We need Sonic CD.

01:59:48.520 --> 01:59:50.640
Maybe it's an unlock, you never know.

01:59:50.640 --> 01:59:53.300
We need the Japanese version of Sonic CD that has the better music.

01:59:53.300 --> 01:59:54.300
You never know.

01:59:54.300 --> 01:59:55.300
We need nights.

01:59:55.300 --> 01:59:56.300
We need a new nights game.

01:59:56.300 --> 01:59:57.300
We will see.

01:59:57.300 --> 02:00:04.840
Real quick, rumor is that we'll get our first glimpse of Metal Gear Solid 3 Snake Eater

02:00:04.840 --> 02:00:05.840
this October.

02:00:05.840 --> 02:00:09.320
It's going to be launched in Japan this October is the current rumor.

02:00:09.320 --> 02:00:12.100
We'll confirm that for you as soon as we find out.

02:00:12.100 --> 02:00:16.200
Coming out on the Game Boy Advance, you know those Nintendo games that you're paying 20

02:00:16.200 --> 02:00:19.700
bucks for to play the same damn game you played 15 years ago?

02:00:19.700 --> 02:00:25.220
There's even more coming out this time, Dr. Mario, Metroid, which seems completely pointless

02:00:25.220 --> 02:00:29.100
to me, because if you want to play the old Metroid, fucking buy Metroid Zero, because

02:00:29.100 --> 02:00:32.320
not only will you get the old Metroid, but you should get a fucking awesome Metroid game

02:00:32.320 --> 02:00:34.740
with it, based off the old Metroid.

02:00:34.740 --> 02:00:41.740
And wasn't there a way you can supposedly link the original, your Game Boy Advance with,

02:00:42.740 --> 02:00:47.060
what was it, Metroid Prime? Yes, Prime and Fusion could link together and you can also

02:00:47.060 --> 02:00:52.060
the original Metroid that way, so this will be the third time we've had the original Metroid available.

02:00:52.060 --> 02:00:53.060
You know what?

02:00:53.060 --> 02:00:54.060
In the past few years, yes.

02:00:54.060 --> 02:00:55.060
Guardian Legend.

02:00:55.060 --> 02:00:56.060
I know, I know.

02:00:56.060 --> 02:00:57.060
Guardian Legend!

02:00:57.060 --> 02:00:58.060
I tried to get people to vote for it.

02:00:58.060 --> 02:00:59.060
I told Guardian Legend.

02:00:59.060 --> 02:01:01.060
Well, there are two more that we're going to get.

02:01:01.060 --> 02:01:04.060
Castlevania is coming out.

02:01:04.060 --> 02:01:05.060
That is cool.

02:01:05.060 --> 02:01:06.060
That's a must-have.

02:01:06.060 --> 02:01:10.060
Of course, if you have a PlayStation, you could also just get Castlevania Chronicles.

02:01:10.060 --> 02:01:14.060
Or you could just fucking get Symphony of the Night and get a really good Castlevania game.

02:01:14.060 --> 02:01:15.060
First, that was good.

02:01:15.060 --> 02:01:18.060
I've been playing a lot of Aria of Sorrow recently.

02:01:18.060 --> 02:01:21.060
Castlevania 3 was the best of the Nintendo ones, the Japanese ones.

02:01:21.060 --> 02:01:28.060
I haven't been playing a whole lot of new Castlevania games on Game Boy Advance, but I've been playing this Aria of Sorrow a lot. I actually really like it, it's pretty cool.

02:01:28.060 --> 02:01:33.060
Also, Zelda 2, the Adventure of Link, I think we all knew that was a good one.

02:01:33.060 --> 02:01:34.060
That would make Dan happy.

02:01:34.060 --> 02:01:35.060
At some point.

02:01:35.060 --> 02:01:39.060
I could not get into Zelda 2, but he loves that game.

02:01:39.060 --> 02:01:40.060
Yep.

02:01:40.060 --> 02:01:43.060
Also another video game, yes, Logie?

02:01:43.060 --> 02:02:00.060
I'd like to mention beforehand. Um, we do remember, like, you know, Advent Children, of course, being the direct sequel to, uh, Final Fantasy VII. Before Crisis being the cell phone game. Well, now there's a new trademark for the U.S. Actually, there's two trademarks for the U.S. First of all, Before Crisis is coming out over in the U.S.

02:02:00.060 --> 02:02:01.060
On cell phones?

02:02:01.060 --> 02:02:21.060
Whether it be a cell phone or a Gameboy Advance title, that's my guess. And then another one called Dawn of Souls, which is also tied in with the Final Fantasy VII thing, so whatever that is. But it was rumored that they were going to be making a spinoff with Vincent being the lead.

02:02:21.060 --> 02:02:27.060
Now that would just make me so happy, because Vincent was my favorite character in Final Fantasy VII.

02:02:27.060 --> 02:02:28.060
Yeah, so...

02:02:28.060 --> 02:02:35.060
Like, my last party was Yuffie, Vincent, and of course Cloud, because you couldn't go without him.

02:02:35.060 --> 02:02:37.060
If I could have ditched Cloud, I would have so fast.

02:02:37.060 --> 02:02:50.060
They have some really kick-ass scans online, too. If you go to www.adventchildren.net, they've got some awesome scans, and then there's some retard trying to make his own game and stuff.

02:02:50.060 --> 02:02:54.620
stuff and yeah yeah yeah but like you know this is kind of bad radio but I'm

02:02:54.620 --> 02:03:02.380
going to show this in studio here we've got a nice picture of Vincent here that

02:03:02.380 --> 02:03:07.900
is said there was whatever okay I meant I was looking at Vincent that's it shut

02:03:07.900 --> 02:03:14.500
up kiss my ass there's another kick-ass one of a sit here hitting god knows what

02:03:14.500 --> 02:03:17.880
I know what you could do why don't you post this link in our chat room so the

02:03:17.880 --> 02:03:21.520
chatters can play along and see some of these pictures because they are very nice pictures

02:03:21.520 --> 02:03:35.480
I got to say. All right. Any other pictures you want to show us in the studio though?

02:03:35.480 --> 02:03:45.680
Yeah, there's a really kick ass one of Vincent. Okay. That one's pretty. Now that is my man.

02:03:45.680 --> 02:03:50.960
that's pretty sweet and we've got of course the return of red 13

02:03:50.960 --> 02:03:55.080
you know what's funny is that the whole time I ever played Final Fantasy 7 I never

02:03:55.080 --> 02:03:59.720
got Vincent. UVS, Vincent no. Go figure.

02:03:59.720 --> 02:04:02.760
last call for cage match votes in our chat room FYI

02:04:02.760 --> 02:04:07.200
also in other video gaming news recently Metroid Prime will be having a

02:04:07.200 --> 02:04:08.160
GameCube

02:04:08.160 --> 02:04:12.160
bundle coming out of course with the release of Metroid Prime 2 on the way

02:04:12.160 --> 02:04:15.360
if you're thinking about getting a GameCube now's a good time because Metroid Prime

02:04:15.360 --> 02:04:20.120
Prime will be released with the GameCube, and they'll also have a sneak peek at Metroid

02:04:20.120 --> 02:04:22.960
Prime 2 Echoes.

02:04:22.960 --> 02:04:28.300
Also there's going to be some new games coming out for the Nintendo DS, which sounds kind

02:04:28.300 --> 02:04:29.720
of cool.

02:04:29.720 --> 02:04:33.360
Lots of games being announced, I'm just going to, I'm going to see what Konami's got planned.

02:04:33.360 --> 02:04:37.340
Konami is going to be coming out with a Castlevania game as well as a game called Boktai, I don't

02:04:37.340 --> 02:04:39.080
know that one.

02:04:39.080 --> 02:04:45.280
There's going to be a Goemon game on Nintendo DS, as well as a pro baseball game, of course

02:04:45.280 --> 02:04:48.400
these are in works for Japan so who knows how many of these will actually

02:04:48.400 --> 02:04:53.000
come over here. I dig a Goemon game. Survival Kids and the Winning Eleven series are

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:58.360
coming out. I'm looking at other games that sound interesting. Sonic DS. There's

02:04:58.360 --> 02:05:03.580
going to be a Megaman Battle Network game from Capcom. Of course the

02:05:03.580 --> 02:05:07.840
mandatory Bust-A-Move title. I know you must hate that name but that is what

02:05:07.840 --> 02:05:13.800
they call it here in the US or Puzzle Bobble if you must. And for you,

02:05:13.800 --> 02:05:16.800
Didi or Angel, Monster Rancher.

02:05:16.800 --> 02:05:17.800
I'm sorry, not Monster Rancher.

02:05:17.800 --> 02:05:18.800
Oh, shut up.

02:05:18.800 --> 02:05:19.800
No, I'm sorry, not that one.

02:05:19.800 --> 02:05:20.800
I was thinking Harvest Moon.

02:05:20.800 --> 02:05:21.800
There you go.

02:05:21.800 --> 02:05:22.800
That's what I was thinking of, Harvest Moon.

02:05:22.800 --> 02:05:23.800
Monster Rancher.

02:05:23.800 --> 02:05:24.800
Although, there is a Monster Rancher as well.

02:05:24.800 --> 02:05:25.800
You're a Monster Rancher.

02:05:25.800 --> 02:05:26.800
All right.

02:05:26.800 --> 02:05:27.800
Anyway, do you want to know what Booktie really is?

02:05:27.800 --> 02:05:28.800
What?

02:05:28.800 --> 02:05:33.080
It's like a, I want to say it's like a vampire type thing, but like, I don't know, something

02:05:33.080 --> 02:05:34.080
more cartoony.

02:05:34.080 --> 02:05:35.080
Mm-hmm.

02:05:35.080 --> 02:05:37.440
But, uh, it's got some sun sensor thing or whatever on it.

02:05:37.440 --> 02:05:38.720
Oh, they have that game here.

02:05:38.720 --> 02:05:39.720
Yeah.

02:05:39.720 --> 02:05:41.560
I forget the name of it here, but they, they do have it here.

02:05:41.560 --> 02:05:42.560
I thought that was a book tie.

02:05:42.560 --> 02:05:43.560
Yeah, with the sunlight.

02:05:43.560 --> 02:05:44.560
Maybe it was called that.

02:05:44.560 --> 02:05:45.560
Sorry, sorry, I almost...

02:05:45.560 --> 02:05:46.560
Oh, okay.

02:05:46.560 --> 02:05:47.560
All right.

02:05:47.560 --> 02:05:48.560
I almost bought that.

02:05:48.560 --> 02:05:51.680
I almost bought that, but I bought Sword of Mana instead, and I wish I'd bought the other

02:05:51.680 --> 02:05:53.560
game because I don't like Sword of Mana.

02:05:53.560 --> 02:05:54.560
So...

02:05:54.560 --> 02:05:55.560
Oh, well.

02:05:55.560 --> 02:05:56.560
You live, you learn.

02:05:56.560 --> 02:05:57.560
All right.

02:05:57.560 --> 02:06:03.000
That's it for other gaming news tonight, so we're going to wrap up the cage match voting,

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:05.560

thought astro sexy was guaranteed win again yeah cuz you know if the one

02:06:28.140 --> 02:06:31.020
person that voted for California dreamin would have voted for the other song

02:06:31.020 --> 02:06:35.000
could have been different but the one person that voted for California

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:45.000
Oh well. Now I'm not going to say every vote is cast in secret, but if you want to out yourself on air, go ahead.

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:48.000
I'll just make another inflow song next week.

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:49.000
There you go.

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:52.000
Better watch it, I'll pick Toxic.

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.000
I almost put Toxic in tonight.

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000
I'll make you guys listen to Britney.

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:59.000
You guys are getting Danny Minnow again next week.

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:03.000
Okay, I'm not going to torture you guys that badly, I'll pick some inflow.

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:11.000
Alright. I think we're going to go to a break. What should we hear in this break? I don't know. Just let me give me an idea for a theme for this video.

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:12.000
Taku.

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:15.000
Some Taku? Alright. Some Taku?

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.000
No. Play Thrash Tracks.

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.000
Oh God. Is that Taku?

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:20.000
Yeah.

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:21.000
Was it really?

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000
Thrash Tracks and Tetraku.

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.000
Alright, fine.

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:28.000
I want old Taku stuff.

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:33.540
All right, we'll hear some of that and then we'll be back and we're gonna do tonight's episode of listless

02:07:33.540 --> 02:07:36.340
and remember we're still looking for your ideas from the chatroom.

02:07:36.340 --> 02:07:39.840
Itoygame I'd most like to see in DDR.

02:07:39.840 --> 02:07:46.840
we'll be back

02:12:39.840 --> 02:12:50.960
Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:12:50.960 --> 02:12:55.120
We are back, and as promised, we're going to get into tonight's edition of Listless.

02:12:55.120 --> 02:12:57.360
I think we need a theme song for Listless.

02:12:57.360 --> 02:13:00.280
What's a good Bomani song that's like a theme song for Listless?

02:13:00.280 --> 02:13:01.680
Um, Holic.

02:13:01.680 --> 02:13:04.560
You can't do Holic again.

02:13:04.560 --> 02:13:12.060
I know, the one that was the pop music video. It sounds very game show-y.

02:13:12.060 --> 02:13:13.560
Oh, Linus.

02:13:13.560 --> 02:13:14.560
Yeah.

02:13:14.560 --> 02:13:18.560
Shit, do I have Linus? I don't have that song readily available to me.

02:13:18.560 --> 02:13:21.560
Oh, but I thought...

02:13:21.560 --> 02:13:26.060
Let's see if I can find it. Oh, damn, all my pop music special stuff is gone.

02:13:26.060 --> 02:13:28.560
Oh, I know a good one. I know a good one, because you said pop music.

02:13:28.560 --> 02:13:31.560
That made me think of a pop music song that would be really good if I could find it.

02:13:31.560 --> 02:13:36.740
crap oh here it is here it is yes it's that it's that um that toy sounding song

02:13:36.740 --> 02:13:45.240
from nine it's time to play listless

02:13:46.760 --> 02:13:54.840
can't fire rod you're not in tonight's edition of listless we will be

02:13:54.840 --> 02:14:00.780
determining the i-toy game we most want to see in a TDR game the way that

02:14:00.780 --> 02:14:09.780
The list list works is that each host and each guest will make their list of three games that they want to see in an IToy DDR.

02:14:09.780 --> 02:14:16.780
After that, we will have the elimination round, where each person will take one thing off of the list.

02:14:16.780 --> 02:14:23.780
After that, the chat room will be able to vote. So if you're not in the chat room, join in now.

02:14:23.780 --> 02:14:26.780
www.orangeloungeradio.com

02:14:26.780 --> 02:14:28.780
Click on chat.

02:14:28.780 --> 02:14:35.780
And now, let's play, Listless!

02:14:36.220 --> 02:14:39.620
Rob, you've scared me.

02:14:39.620 --> 02:14:43.180
Beyond all capacity to be scared!

02:14:43.180 --> 02:14:47.060
Except there's no slugs involved. If there were slugs involved, I'd be even more scared.

02:14:47.060 --> 02:14:50.360
In all seriousness, let's get to tonight's list.

02:14:50.360 --> 02:14:54.840
Alright, let's see. Eye toy game I most want to see in DDR. Starting off tonight,

02:14:54.840 --> 02:14:58.060
who always starts us off? The lovely Dark Sakura.

02:14:58.060 --> 02:15:02.980
Damn straight on lovely. She's a trendsetter. I sure am. Number three iToy game you most

02:15:02.980 --> 02:15:13.100
want to see in DDR? Car Wash the Game. Car Wash the Game. Explain how this works. You'd

02:15:13.100 --> 02:15:19.420
have your buckets on the ground and one would be your sponge and you'd wash the car and

02:15:19.420 --> 02:15:24.060
then you'd have the hose that you'd spray down the car. And would this actually relate

02:15:24.060 --> 02:15:29.540
to DDR at all? No. Alright, fine. How about, it'll play Eurobeat while you do it. Okay.

02:15:29.540 --> 02:15:34.180
Alright, there you go. I know, I know. Better yet, how about Bikini Car Wash the game? Alright.

02:15:34.180 --> 02:15:38.940
Then like your icon, you just like, you know, and so like, the better you do, the hotter

02:15:38.940 --> 02:15:42.640
you are and the more tips you get. Okay, Bikini Car Wash the game. Alright, fine. That works.

02:15:42.640 --> 02:15:46.440
I'll change it there. Alright. And if it's a guy, then it's Speedo Car Wash. I see, I

02:15:46.440 --> 02:15:52.420
was thinking the movie Car Wash. At the Car Wash, yeah. Alright, I could be playing in

02:15:52.420 --> 02:15:58.180
in the background. All right, Angel. All right, then let's go to RKDN42 since Angel's working

02:15:58.180 --> 02:16:02.460
there. RKDN42, number three iToy game you would most like to see in DDR.

02:16:02.460 --> 02:16:07.300
I just made a comment about that car wash. As long as no one's carrying around a bucket

02:16:07.300 --> 02:16:11.460
of piss. Okay.

02:16:11.460 --> 02:16:14.220
That wasn't that car wash. That could be like negative points.

02:16:14.220 --> 02:16:19.140
That wasn't car wash. Someone was carrying around a thing of piss. I don't know why.

02:16:19.140 --> 02:16:21.140
Alright, the movie sucked.

02:16:21.140 --> 02:16:23.140
Alright, anyway.

02:16:23.140 --> 02:16:25.140
Number three, Lice Invaders.

02:16:25.140 --> 02:16:29.140
Watch out, they're coming down from the sky to attack your head.

02:16:29.140 --> 02:16:31.140
Lice Invaders.

02:16:31.140 --> 02:16:33.140
Okay, Lice Invaders.

02:16:33.140 --> 02:16:39.140
And to relate this to DDR, Lice Invaders would also play Eurobeat in the background, correct?

02:16:39.140 --> 02:16:41.140
Alright, alright, fine.

02:16:41.140 --> 02:16:43.140
Alright, Lice Invaders.

02:16:43.140 --> 02:16:46.140
Alright, DDR Angel.

02:16:46.140 --> 02:16:49.020
Number three itoy game you would most like to see in DDR?

02:16:49.020 --> 02:16:53.540
I couldn't really come up with anything for number three, so I just said mini pop music or mini 2dx

02:16:53.740 --> 02:16:57.460
Like a mini like a chibi 2dx. How about I say that? Chibi 2dx?

02:16:59.920 --> 02:17:05.640
Yeah, cuz I couldn't come up with anything else original. Oh well. All right, that's fine. That's fine a little chibi game

02:17:05.640 --> 02:17:07.640
That'll be cute. All right, Loki your

02:17:08.300 --> 02:17:13.080
Number three pick for a itoy game. I would most like to see in DDR

02:17:13.080 --> 02:17:30.080
My game is so awesome. It's called Break Shit. Basically, um...

02:17:30.080 --> 02:17:32.080
You are so bad in the face.

02:17:32.080 --> 02:17:38.080
Okay. Damn this yogurt! Anyways, um, no basically...

02:17:38.080 --> 02:17:40.080
Is your yogurt that hot?

02:17:40.080 --> 02:17:49.080
Yes it is. It makes me giggle. Anyways, no, basically what you do is an object would come on the screen and you break it.

02:17:49.080 --> 02:17:52.080
Alright.

02:17:52.080 --> 02:17:58.080
Alright, Loki suggesting Break Shit is the iToy game he would most like to see in DDR. Alright.

02:17:58.080 --> 02:18:03.080
And again, to relate this to DDR, Eurobeat Music would be playing in the background. Alright.

02:18:03.080 --> 02:18:04.080
You break shit.

02:18:04.080 --> 02:18:05.080
Daikinkai.

02:18:05.080 --> 02:18:06.080
Yeah, Daikinkai.

02:18:06.080 --> 02:18:12.080
My number three game I would most like to see in DDR, Whack-a-Child.

02:18:12.080 --> 02:18:16.080
That sounds brilliant.

02:18:16.080 --> 02:18:24.080
Whack-a-Child. Basically as you play DDR, little children come on the screen and you have to whack them away.

02:18:24.080 --> 02:18:26.080
Do you have the big orange bat icon?

02:18:26.080 --> 02:18:28.080
You could. That would be like the bonus stage.

02:18:28.080 --> 02:18:30.080
Okay.

02:18:30.080 --> 02:18:34.080
Number two pick now from Jamie.

02:18:34.080 --> 02:18:36.520
It would be something like the candy bar doll maker.

02:18:36.520 --> 02:18:39.000
I don't know if you've seen all the dolls I've been posting in my live journal.

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:40.000
No.

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:46.800
Oh, well, I did have this thing with the candy bar doll maker, and this is, it's like an

02:18:46.800 --> 02:18:51.360
interactive thing where you make the outfits and choose the hair and everything, but you

02:18:51.360 --> 02:19:00.120
could use it to, if you want to see what the original candy bar was, it's candybar.co.kr,

02:19:00.120 --> 02:19:03.520
but there's also an English one if you look it up on Google.

02:19:03.520 --> 02:19:08.840
But anyway, you use the doll maker and you make your character for DDR and then you play

02:19:08.840 --> 02:19:09.840
as that character.

02:19:09.840 --> 02:19:14.880
So you can drag the hair over and you can make him a boy or make him a girl.

02:19:14.880 --> 02:19:17.360
That's the gayest game I've ever heard of, but alright fine.

02:19:17.360 --> 02:19:21.320
Candy Bar Doll Game is what... and Eurobeat would play in the background while you do

02:19:21.320 --> 02:19:22.320
it.

02:19:22.320 --> 02:19:23.320
Nope.

02:19:23.320 --> 02:19:24.320
Nope.

02:19:24.320 --> 02:19:25.320
It would be like the OHA music.

02:19:25.320 --> 02:19:26.320
Okay, the OHA music.

02:19:26.320 --> 02:19:30.920
Alright, Arkadium42, your number two pick.

02:19:30.920 --> 02:19:36.700
Originally I came up with the idea of head explode mode, or head explode mode, explode

02:19:36.700 --> 02:19:40.580
mode if you want, but I thought it would maybe make it cooler, be the evade the assassins

02:19:40.580 --> 02:19:47.840
bullet game, where you see the red dot on your head and you have to avoid it.

02:19:47.840 --> 02:19:48.840
And if you don't...

02:19:48.840 --> 02:19:55.160
Evade the assassins bullet game, so a little red laser would appear on your head, and if

02:19:55.160 --> 02:20:00.500
you don't move out of the way, then boom, your head explodes, and if it actually explodes

02:20:00.500 --> 02:20:03.740
that would make it a little bit more dangerous and maybe a bit more fun.

02:20:03.740 --> 02:20:09.060
It would work for coming in silent scope mode. Yes, there you go, silent scope mode.

02:20:09.060 --> 02:20:12.220
Alright, brilliant. I like it. I'm going to put that in parenthesis.

02:20:12.220 --> 02:20:15.780
Silent scope. Alright.

02:20:15.780 --> 02:20:19.220
Angel, your number two pick.

02:20:19.220 --> 02:20:23.880
Let's see. Um, hell.

02:20:23.880 --> 02:20:26.900
Okay, how about, um, mini Flashwater?

02:20:26.900 --> 02:20:31.820
Do you remember that game from Mario Paint? The thing where you just take the mouse and

02:20:31.820 --> 02:20:36.660
then like swaddle the flies and crap? Mini Fly, so the fly swatting game. Yes, Nat

02:20:36.660 --> 02:20:40.460
Attack, that's what it was called. I don't know, I just thought maybe that'd be kind

02:20:40.460 --> 02:20:44.860
of cool. I'm not funny tonight. Oh well. That's alright, we're going to need some serious

02:20:44.860 --> 02:20:50.160
ones in here anyway. Alright, Loki, your number two pick for iToy game that you would like

02:20:50.160 --> 02:20:56.540
to see in DDR. I'm looking at your list, because I can see your list over on your computer

02:20:56.540 --> 02:21:01.940
and I can't help it because it's funny. Alright. Answer the damn question. You're number two

02:21:01.940 --> 02:21:11.940
pick. I can't. He's laughing too hard. It's funny. Say it. No. It's all your damn fault.

02:21:11.940 --> 02:21:16.260
See, he starts giggling and then I can't. Okay, here's some serious thoughts. Things

02:21:16.260 --> 02:21:26.520
that you like. You know. Okay. Shooting RBGL children in the head. Shh. Okay. My next

02:21:26.520 --> 02:21:30.520
This one is awesome. It's basically, I'm itchy.

02:21:30.520 --> 02:21:37.520
It sounds like a personal problem.

02:21:37.520 --> 02:21:43.520
I think it's pretty self-explanatory. You see the spot on your body gets red. It's it.

02:21:43.520 --> 02:21:46.520
Do you have jock itch?

02:21:46.520 --> 02:21:49.520
I'm itchy is Loki's number two pick.

02:21:49.520 --> 02:21:56.000
pick. If Whack-A-Child wasn't quite good enough for you, then we have, um, Whack-A-Parent

02:21:56.000 --> 02:22:00.820
would be the iToy game I would like to see. Whack-A-Parent. Because we all know that it's

02:22:00.820 --> 02:22:05.620
not really the kids' fault, it's their parents. So Whack-A-Parent is my number two pick.

02:22:05.620 --> 02:22:12.280
I would so own it at. Alright. Alright, uh, Jamie, you're number two. I'm sorry, you're

02:22:12.280 --> 02:22:18.200
number one. My last one, the thing is, I don't, it would require that you be able to play

02:22:18.200 --> 02:22:23.600
with two y-toys, honestly. Well that's fine, you're innovative. Okay. It would be called

02:22:23.600 --> 02:22:30.600
fuck with the other player's arrows mode. Where you would basically reach over on their

02:22:30.960 --> 02:22:36.960
side and move their arrows. You would actually reach over and rearrange their arrows. Exactly.

02:22:36.960 --> 02:22:41.840
Alright, I like that idea. Seriously, think about how crazy that would be. That would

02:22:41.840 --> 02:22:46.800
like fill a hole in your spin on Dance Battle. Could you just like knock all your own arrows

02:22:46.800 --> 02:22:51.800
Yeah, you can do that. You can shove your arrows over to their side.

02:22:51.800 --> 02:23:06.800
Actually, that reminds me of, I don't know if anybody played You Don't Know Jack, but volume 4 has this mode where it's nail mode where you just pound the end key and all these nails go on a question so you can't read it and the person has to guess. They're like forced to guess.

02:23:06.800 --> 02:23:15.800
Alright, let's get the mic on over to Artadium42 for his number one pick for iToygame I would most like to see in DDR.

02:23:15.800 --> 02:23:21.800
Alright, my number one pick will be Dandruff White Christmas.

02:23:21.800 --> 02:23:26.800
There will be little people on the bottom of the screen and they're so wishing for a white Christmas.

02:23:26.800 --> 02:23:28.800
And you are the number one producer of Dandruff.

02:23:28.800 --> 02:23:32.160
And you are going to give them a nice white Christmas by shaking your head

02:23:32.680 --> 02:23:38.240
Into various directions to make sure they have a beautiful beautiful Christmas a lot of DDR players

02:23:38.240 --> 02:23:41.640
I know wouldn't need an eye toy actually for this. No. I'm kidding all right

02:23:42.280 --> 02:23:45.420
The ender of white Christmas mode very interesting, okay?

02:23:46.720 --> 02:23:49.240
Um DDR angel you're number one pick

02:23:50.360 --> 02:23:56.120
Actually, I'm gonna be completely kidding and go to the mini, but game darn it laughs the mini, but game. How does that work?

02:23:56.120 --> 02:24:19.120
In WarioWare, there's this game where it says shoot, and you have to shoot water on this flower to make it spin, but the flower looks like an asshole.

02:24:19.120 --> 02:24:27.120
So it looks like this moving bidet that you're using to shoot water up somebody's asshole.

02:24:27.120 --> 02:24:32.120
So Angel wants to turn this into an itoy game. What was your real answer?

02:24:32.120 --> 02:24:36.120
My real answer was going to be mini Burger King time, but I don't know if that was going to work.

02:24:36.120 --> 02:24:42.120
I like the mini butt game. I'm going to actually take that to mini water in your asshole.

02:24:42.120 --> 02:24:55.120
Oh my god, how old are we people?

02:24:55.120 --> 02:25:06.120
Oh shit!

02:25:06.120 --> 02:25:09.240
Rob is all red in the face now, this has got to be good.

02:25:09.240 --> 02:25:10.240
Oh god I love this.

02:25:10.240 --> 02:25:11.240
Here take the mic.

02:25:11.240 --> 02:25:12.240
Damn you!

02:25:12.240 --> 02:25:17.880
Alright I'll do it, I'll do it.

02:25:17.880 --> 02:25:24.720
No make, no make, make him do it, make him do it.

02:25:24.720 --> 02:25:25.720
Make him say it.

02:25:25.720 --> 02:25:34.440
Come here, come here, come here, it's okay, deep breaths.

02:25:34.440 --> 02:25:35.440
Alright, let's see.

02:25:35.440 --> 02:25:36.440
Oh, the next one.

02:25:36.440 --> 02:25:38.720
And my final one, number one.

02:25:38.720 --> 02:25:41.960
I have plenty more where this came from too, this just happens to be the one that comes

02:25:41.960 --> 02:25:42.960
to my head right now.

02:25:42.960 --> 02:25:45.400
Yeah, I pulled it out of my ass.

02:25:45.400 --> 02:25:49.120
This next one is basically like a quiz show game.

02:25:49.120 --> 02:25:55.320
It's kind of like you don't know Jack, where you get like three questions.

02:25:55.320 --> 02:25:59.200
And the problem will be that they're very hard.

02:25:59.200 --> 02:26:04.200
So, if you get the question wrong, you catch fire.

02:26:04.200 --> 02:26:13.200
It's called answer question or catch fire, and you can't play around too much because

02:26:13.200 --> 02:26:23.200
otherwise, you know, fire burns faster when you're moving, so that's, yeah.

02:26:23.200 --> 02:26:30.160
Another question or catch fire is Loki's choice and don't flail around too much because the

02:26:30.160 --> 02:26:34.240
fire just grows that way.

02:26:34.240 --> 02:26:35.240
Alright.

02:26:35.240 --> 02:26:39.640
It should have been burn victim the game.

02:26:39.640 --> 02:26:42.680
Now Loki's saying burn victim the game, nope too late.

02:26:42.680 --> 02:26:45.000
It's answer question or catch fire.

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:49.840
Alright and again to relate this to DDR Eurobeat music would play in the background I should

02:26:49.840 --> 02:26:50.840
play.

02:26:50.840 --> 02:26:57.720
Alright, my number one pick for IToyGame I would like to see in DDR, you've seen Wacka

02:26:57.720 --> 02:27:04.280
Child, you've seen Wacka Parent, but the best one by far is Wackapolitary, is my number

02:27:04.280 --> 02:27:05.280
one choice.

02:27:05.280 --> 02:27:06.280
Wackapolitary.

02:27:06.280 --> 02:27:07.280
Wackapolitary.

02:27:07.280 --> 02:27:11.480
Do you think you'd see that in like, Derby owners club?

02:27:11.480 --> 02:27:13.400
Well, yeah, but that's a little different.

02:27:13.400 --> 02:27:17.680
Actually, Politary would come out on the screen, she would actually sing, broken my heart,

02:27:17.680 --> 02:27:20.680
and you can punch her in the stomach.

02:27:20.680 --> 02:27:27.680
to get her to stop so alright so that's my number one answer whack-a-policary

02:27:28.440 --> 02:27:31.960
alright now unfortunately comes the part

02:27:31.960 --> 02:27:35.760
where we have to eliminate one off the list a piece

02:27:35.760 --> 02:27:39.320
so right now here is the list as it stands. Do you want to read this Jamie?

02:27:39.320 --> 02:27:43.800
Can you read it from back there? Okay. Alright. Bikini car wash the game

02:27:43.800 --> 02:27:48.720
life invaders chibi TDX for popin' music

02:27:48.720 --> 02:27:55.720
Break shit. Whack a child. Candy bar doll game. Evade the assassin's bullet

02:27:55.720 --> 02:28:04.720
silent scope. Mini fly swatter nat attack. I'm itchy. Whack a parent. Fuck with the other

02:28:04.720 --> 02:28:13.720
player's arrows. Dandruff white Christmas. Mini water in your asshole day. Stop that.

02:28:13.720 --> 02:28:17.200
You're trying to make me bust up, okay?

02:28:17.200 --> 02:28:20.440
Answer a question or catch fire, or whack-a-policary.

02:28:20.440 --> 02:28:23.800
You know what, I should have read it like in that Margaret Cho- since we're talking about

02:28:23.800 --> 02:28:25.560
Margaret Cho and the chapter, I should have done,

02:28:25.560 --> 02:28:30.000
Galloping Critterous. Alright, this is hard. Honestly, these are all really good.

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:34.320
I've got money. This is a very difficult elimination round for us, because there's a lot of these that are

02:28:34.320 --> 02:28:37.440
fucking funny. Yes, Angel? One comment about the whole thing is,

02:28:37.440 --> 02:28:41.320
oh my god, it's I Toy Meets WarioWare. I Toy Meets WarioWare.

02:28:41.320 --> 02:28:46.320
Alright, Jamie, you gotta take one off the list. Which number is coming off?

02:28:46.320 --> 02:28:48.320
Uh, dandruff white christmas goes.

02:28:48.320 --> 02:28:50.320
Alright, dandruff white christmas.

02:28:50.320 --> 02:28:51.320
Dandruff is nasty.

02:28:51.320 --> 02:28:54.320
Alright, that's too bad. Alright.

02:28:54.320 --> 02:28:55.320
Fired!

02:28:55.320 --> 02:28:58.320
Uh, Arkadian, your turn. You gotta take one off the list.

02:28:58.320 --> 02:29:03.320
I see I have too many whack things to say. Whack a parent. It's more fun to whack kids.

02:29:03.320 --> 02:29:09.320
Alright, because it's more fun to whack kids than whack parents, uh, whack a parent is coming off the list. Alright.

02:29:09.320 --> 02:29:11.320
Angel, one of these has to come off the list.

02:29:15.320 --> 02:29:17.320
Um...

02:29:19.320 --> 02:29:22.320
I don't know. Candy Bar Doll Game.

02:29:23.320 --> 02:29:27.320
Candy Bar Doll Game. Yeah, that was a little gay, Jamie. Even you have to admit.

02:29:29.320 --> 02:29:30.320
Alright.

02:29:30.320 --> 02:29:32.320
Loki, which one of these is coming off the list?

02:29:32.320 --> 02:29:41.440
off the list? Um, you know, as much as I don't like her, uh, wack-a-policary, because wack-a-child

02:29:41.440 --> 02:29:47.960
is the best. Yeah, wack-a-child is pretty. All right, wack-a-policary comes off the list,

02:29:47.960 --> 02:29:54.000
that's fine. Uh, me, I have to take one off the list, and I've got to say, I'm just not

02:29:54.000 --> 02:30:00.280
feeling it for, um, chibi2dx, I'm sorry. Sorry, Angel. Yeah, why have a bimani-related game

02:30:00.280 --> 02:30:05.480
yeah one of the money related game anything all right

02:30:05.480 --> 02:30:07.640
by the fact that

02:30:07.640 --> 02:30:13.100
you can see if you can use the lucky method and pull it out of your ass

02:30:13.100 --> 02:30:15.560
al

02:30:15.560 --> 02:30:17.160

02:30:27.920 --> 02:30:29.860
socially incorrect uh...

02:30:29.860 --> 02:30:32.940
politically incorrect statements that Loki makes when you can't hear him.

right now if anybody would like to send their even though your session is a

02:31:57.760 --> 02:32:01.040
little late to make the list maybe there's something you want to vote for

02:32:01.040 --> 02:32:04.400
you want to persuade other people to vote on the list or maybe you have a

02:32:04.400 --> 02:32:08.240
suggestion that was just really good and we missed it and that's just too damn

02:32:08.240 --> 02:32:12.040
bad because you know you don't make the list so the skype line is open right now

02:32:12.040 --> 02:32:16.080
let's see if anybody gives us a call otherwise I guess we're just gonna have

02:32:40.320 --> 02:32:44.200
see it. Yeah, we were too busy laughing at answer question or catch fire. They were all

02:32:44.200 --> 02:32:50.520
red in the face. It was cute. Actually, I was thinking you could combine the DER pad

02:32:50.520 --> 02:32:54.520
with the eye toy to create something sort of like a samurai game.

02:32:54.520 --> 02:32:55.520
He's saying...

02:32:55.520 --> 02:32:56.520
...run at each other.

02:32:56.520 --> 02:32:57.520
We're having a hard time hearing you.

02:32:57.520 --> 02:33:02.520
I'm going to say that he's saying something about you could combine the DDR pad with the

02:33:02.520 --> 02:33:06.520
eye toy to make like a samurai game where you could run at each other type thing.

02:33:06.520 --> 02:33:07.520
Kind of like a...

02:33:07.520 --> 02:33:08.520
Right.

02:33:08.520 --> 02:33:09.520
And then a punch to attack, basically.

02:33:09.520 --> 02:33:10.520
That's kind of like mocap.

02:33:10.520 --> 02:33:12.520
See, now that's a good, serious answer.

02:33:12.520 --> 02:33:17.520
Unfortunately, it's not funny, but it's actually a good answer as far as serious ones are concerned.

02:33:17.520 --> 02:33:21.520
I always thought they should have used the iToy to make a mocap boxing at home.

02:33:21.520 --> 02:33:24.520
Any other suggestions you got for us, John?

02:33:24.520 --> 02:33:25.520
Uh, that was it, basically.

02:33:25.520 --> 02:33:29.520
Alright, well that's actually a decent one, so you might want to send that on over to Konami, you never know.

02:33:29.520 --> 02:33:31.520
Alright, thanks for calling.

02:33:31.520 --> 02:33:32.520
No problem.

02:33:32.520 --> 02:33:33.520
Bye-bye.

02:33:33.520 --> 02:33:35.520
Let's see if I can answer this call real fast that's coming in.

02:33:35.520 --> 02:33:38.520
Uh, hey, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:33:38.520 --> 02:33:39.520
Hello, Skype, Siggy here.

02:33:39.520 --> 02:33:42.520
Hey, Siggy, how you doing?

02:33:42.520 --> 02:33:43.520
Yeah, hey, I'm doing fine.

02:33:43.520 --> 02:33:44.520
What's your suggestion?

02:33:44.520 --> 02:33:46.820
What's your suggestion?

02:33:46.820 --> 02:33:50.900
I never had that kind of laugh since episode sixty nine. He has not laughed that hard since

02:33:50.900 --> 02:33:56.660
episode sixty nine when Loki sang I'm Coming Out. I wasn't here. I know you weren't even here, Jamie.

02:33:56.660 --> 02:34:00.080
Alright, well, which one made you laugh the most?

02:34:00.080 --> 02:34:03.720
Well, of course, the one that says number thirteen.

02:34:03.720 --> 02:34:05.300
I really, you know,

02:34:05.300 --> 02:34:09.840
the chatters right now, go for number thirteen. Number thirteen, the mini water in your

02:34:09.840 --> 02:34:12.980
asshole game is the one that made him laugh the most.

02:34:12.980 --> 02:34:14.980
I was laughing really hard.

02:34:14.980 --> 02:34:17.980
Oh, my stomach, you know, my stomach's really hurting.

02:34:17.980 --> 02:34:21.980
Well, I'm glad we could cause you such pain here on Orange Lake Radio.

02:34:21.980 --> 02:34:22.980
Uh...

02:34:22.980 --> 02:34:23.980
Take a deep breath.

02:34:23.980 --> 02:34:24.980
Are you okay?

02:34:24.980 --> 02:34:25.980
Breathe in.

02:34:25.980 --> 02:34:28.980
Did you have any suggestions you wanted to pass along?

02:34:28.980 --> 02:34:29.980
Well, I...

02:34:29.980 --> 02:34:30.980
We can barely hear you.

02:34:30.980 --> 02:34:32.980
Speak into your mic a little more.

02:34:32.980 --> 02:34:33.980
Just, uh, yeah, that's it.

02:34:33.980 --> 02:34:34.980
Just, uh, episode.

02:34:34.980 --> 02:34:35.980
Yeah, I mean, uh, episode.

02:34:35.980 --> 02:34:37.980
I mean, uh, vote for number 13.

02:34:37.980 --> 02:34:38.980
All right, he's just saying,

02:34:38.980 --> 02:34:39.980
vote for number 13.

02:34:39.980 --> 02:34:40.980
Many water in your asshole game.

02:34:40.980 --> 02:34:43.980
Alright, we'll see, Siggy. We'll see. Thanks for calling.

02:34:43.980 --> 02:34:44.980
Later.

02:34:44.980 --> 02:34:45.980
Have a good one.

02:34:45.980 --> 02:34:48.980
Oh, I love this phone thing. I love being able to talk to listeners. It's so cool.

02:34:48.980 --> 02:34:52.980
Alright, we'll take more calls a little later, but we're going to take a break so we can tally up the votes.

02:34:52.980 --> 02:34:55.980
And when we come back, we're going to have the FUs of the week. But please don't send them in yet.

02:34:55.980 --> 02:34:57.980
Don't wait until we start the segment to send them in.

02:34:57.980 --> 02:35:04.980
So, we'll be back after this break, featuring, since we did TAC songs, I thought maybe we could do some TACa songs.

02:35:04.980 --> 02:35:07.980
Including Leading Cyber Another, which Jamie wanted to hear earlier.

02:35:07.980 --> 02:35:10.980
Being cyber or another makes me all, like, squishy.

02:35:10.980 --> 02:35:15.100
Alright, so we'll be back after this break of Taka music while you guys vote on tonight's

02:35:15.100 --> 02:35:22.100
listless enjoy

02:35:45.100 --> 02:35:52.100
They can't control my mind

02:35:52.100 --> 02:35:59.100
They can't control my mind

02:37:29.100 --> 02:37:35.100
My bad, I got a location test one in there, so let's do a better quality Taka song. Let's do this one.

02:38:29.100 --> 02:38:31.100
Oh

02:38:59.100 --> 02:39:01.100
Oh

02:39:29.100 --> 02:39:31.100
You

02:41:29.100 --> 02:41:49.700
For them steps wide to orange clouds, this GDR sucks!

02:41:49.700 --> 02:41:50.700
Holla!

02:41:50.700 --> 02:41:51.700
Stop!

02:41:51.700 --> 02:41:52.700
Stop!

02:41:52.700 --> 02:41:53.700
Stop!

02:41:53.700 --> 02:41:54.700
Stop!

02:41:54.700 --> 02:41:55.700
Stop!

02:41:55.700 --> 02:42:03.420
All right, we are back and we're about ready to get into the FUs of the week.

02:42:03.420 --> 02:42:08.580
We just have to wait for the chairman of the FU board to get back here and then we can

02:42:08.580 --> 02:42:09.580
start things off.

02:42:09.580 --> 02:42:10.580
Oh, what do you know?

02:42:10.580 --> 02:42:11.580
There she is.

02:42:11.580 --> 02:42:12.580
Excuse me.

02:42:12.580 --> 02:42:14.580
I need to do a 10 to something.

02:42:14.580 --> 02:42:15.580
Thank you.

02:42:15.580 --> 02:42:16.580
All right.

02:42:16.580 --> 02:42:19.380
Yeah, you had to go worship the porcelain goddess.

02:42:19.380 --> 02:42:20.380
No.

02:42:20.380 --> 02:42:22.380
I'm just teasing.

02:42:22.380 --> 02:42:23.380
Okay.

02:42:23.380 --> 02:42:24.380
All right.

02:42:24.380 --> 02:42:25.380
So we got to get this in.

02:42:25.380 --> 02:42:28.500
Hopefully we have a little bit of time for Ask Orange Lounge, but I don't know.

02:42:28.500 --> 02:42:29.900
We definitely have to get this segment in.

02:42:29.900 --> 02:42:34.100
Why is it, Jamie, that we have to do these FUs every single week?

02:42:34.100 --> 02:42:36.100
Sometimes you just gotta let it out.

02:42:36.100 --> 02:43:01.220
My first FU goes to the almost entirety of traffic on the road today, which is why I

02:43:01.220 --> 02:43:06.820
stand by my desire to have a Humvee with a freaking missile launcher on it so that...

02:43:06.820 --> 02:43:13.580
I finally saw it in action. I found a movie file on military.com of a Humvee with a missile

02:43:13.580 --> 02:43:19.260
launcher blowing up a tank. And that like totally, you know, was so hot to me. So I

02:43:19.260 --> 02:43:30.260
decided that I really, really have to have one now. So I need one for traffic. Another

02:43:30.260 --> 02:43:37.820
Another F.U. goes toward, uh, I'm getting a little panicky about school so I guess this

02:43:37.820 --> 02:43:40.740
sort of goes to me for being kind of panicky about it.

02:43:40.740 --> 02:43:47.860
Another F.U. goes toward not having time and money and the ability to go visit who I want

02:43:47.860 --> 02:43:48.860
to.

02:43:48.860 --> 02:43:54.340
Although, I am planning on going to Alabama in November, so I'll come back action and

02:43:54.340 --> 02:44:01.660
all and you'll have to make fun of me and I'll go off with y'all another one

02:44:01.660 --> 02:44:08.020
goes toward I'm gonna be very general with this and say people who just don't

02:44:08.020 --> 02:44:14.220
get it you know you tell them and you point it out and they just don't get it

02:44:14.220 --> 02:44:24.860
you know those people know another as you goes toward that stupid introduction

02:44:24.860 --> 02:44:29.900
to Windows class that I have to take well you know what I say dear class fuck

02:44:29.900 --> 02:44:33.780
you I'm petitioning the Dean so I can test out of it thank you I think I'm

02:44:33.780 --> 02:44:37.260
done oh yeah and then one goes to allergies not having any sinus medicine

02:44:37.260 --> 02:44:42.260
Alright, let's move on to Loki and his FUs of the week.

02:44:42.260 --> 02:44:49.260
Um, my first FU goes to the stupid trees which the limbs keep falling off of.

02:44:49.260 --> 02:44:55.260
I swear to God, I know I'm going to be walking to the apartment during the night, all of a sudden this limb is going to fall on me.

02:44:55.260 --> 02:44:57.260
And that's going to suck.

02:44:57.260 --> 02:45:26.260
Also, fuck you, the SUV drivers. I swear to God, I just saw, like, um, yesterday, two, um, different instances where SUVs crashed into things. First one being into a truck, and the second time, a Humvee jumped the rail and hit another car, because it was, um, an H2. It's not a real Hummer. Yeah, it's not a real Hummer, but, you know.

02:45:26.260 --> 02:45:31.780
in h2 because you know some and and it was a woman was a woman driving it I

02:45:31.780 --> 02:45:37.900
bet you she was on a cell phone too I want to sort of insert a nephew there to

02:45:37.900 --> 02:45:42.220
the h2 they look like shit yeah if you want a hummer you freaking get one that

02:45:42.220 --> 02:45:47.620
looks like it's you know armored that it can run over buildings and live I don't

02:45:47.620 --> 02:45:50.840
have a problem with women driving SUVs or anything like that it's just when you

02:45:50.840 --> 02:45:54.820
drive with cell phones and don't pay attention to shit then you get in an

02:45:54.820 --> 02:46:00.680
Accidents and they kill people because I know there was the stretcher there and they were sure as hell blocking traffic. So

02:46:01.360 --> 02:46:04.440
huh, anyways, fuck you them and

02:46:06.820 --> 02:46:08.880
Fuck you to Alien vs. Predator

02:46:09.580 --> 02:46:11.580
God damn it. That was a waste of two hours

02:46:12.180 --> 02:46:14.180
But it was a funny-ass movie

02:46:14.980 --> 02:46:16.820
Alien vs. Predator

02:46:16.820 --> 02:46:20.100
Yeah, who do I thunk it that it was a buddy comedy?

02:46:20.100 --> 02:46:30.860
my god lame but you know I should have known better going into it and finally I

02:46:30.860 --> 02:46:35.900
don't know that's it I'm done oh that's right talk to you to my co-worker

02:46:35.900 --> 02:46:40.500
actually this is quite funny because the one that was sleeping around she's

02:46:40.500 --> 02:46:51.360
getting demoted she couldn't cut it shows you that it takes more than just

02:46:51.360 --> 02:47:04.960
sleeping around to get into sales bitch all right that's all my turn F you to

02:47:04.960 --> 02:47:09.960
getting sick and F you to having a special friend that you keep passing

02:47:09.960 --> 02:47:18.440
diseases back and forth too. I mean like colds, people. Don't think dirty. Also, I would like

02:47:18.440 --> 02:47:24.240
to say a big F you to faggoty drama queens, and I know that faggot is a derogatory term

02:47:24.240 --> 02:47:28.200
and I don't use it unless I really mean it, okay? This guy I know, he's a real faggot,

02:47:28.200 --> 02:47:31.600
okay? And I'm gay, so I'm allowed to say that word. Like there's a difference between a

02:47:31.600 --> 02:47:37.120
gay person and like a total faggot, okay? And this guy fizzes me off because he is such

02:47:37.120 --> 02:47:40.480
a fucking drama queen you wouldn't even imagine

02:47:40.480 --> 02:47:42.580

02:47:42.580 --> 02:47:46.580
and then like last night i ran into him and there was just this aura

02:47:46.580 --> 02:47:48.440
of just like

02:47:48.440 --> 02:47:51.600
drama-ness that you wouldn't even look me in the eye

02:47:51.600 --> 02:47:54.920

uh... moving on let's go to uh... angel in our team with my art again

02:48:17.320 --> 02:48:18.720
first off uh...

02:48:18.720 --> 02:48:20.960
but you do these horrible commercial

02:48:20.960 --> 02:48:22.280
horrible radio commercial

02:48:22.280 --> 02:48:23.860
fucking kids

02:48:23.860 --> 02:48:27.600
uh... every fifty minutes god damn kids come on

02:48:27.600 --> 02:48:30.880
yes that there is a life but he made the polls on the commercial

02:48:30.880 --> 02:48:33.680
damn kids are so fucking annoying

02:48:33.680 --> 02:48:38.120
I want to shoot the goddamn radio for this stupid kid.

02:48:38.120 --> 02:48:41.120
Looks like it stabbed him through the radio.

02:48:41.120 --> 02:48:42.720
Oh no, I'm dying.

02:48:42.720 --> 02:48:44.800
Oh, Kenny, where are you?

02:48:44.800 --> 02:48:46.980
Oh, let's see what else.

02:48:46.980 --> 02:48:50.080
Fuck you though, radio commercials that have songs that

02:48:50.080 --> 02:48:52.560
take, oh, I like this song.

02:48:52.560 --> 02:48:54.120
And then it's a fucking commercial.

02:48:54.120 --> 02:48:56.920
I hope your business goes down in flames.

02:48:56.920 --> 02:48:59.720
Unfortunately, it's like one of those damn

02:48:59.720 --> 02:49:02.200
car dealerships of Satan that

02:49:02.200 --> 02:49:04.400
going forever

02:49:04.400 --> 02:49:07.220
uh... but into the trees of work that uh...

02:49:07.220 --> 02:49:09.240
or staff on the

02:49:09.240 --> 02:49:10.680
one week are

02:49:10.680 --> 02:49:13.880
i can only afford uh... and for you that i can afford that you know

02:49:13.880 --> 02:49:14.800
for what they did

02:49:14.800 --> 02:49:17.400
really felt that often

02:49:17.400 --> 02:49:23.000
scraping scrub and everything

02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:24.440
being nearly penniless

02:49:24.440 --> 02:49:25.680
have been planned out

02:49:25.680 --> 02:49:27.300
months in advance

02:49:27.300 --> 02:49:28.880
where my money's going

02:49:28.880 --> 02:49:32.660
But hopefully that will change in like a month or two.

02:49:32.660 --> 02:49:35.260
And fuck you to not be able to go places.

02:49:35.260 --> 02:49:40.340
And not be able to go to the arcades or anything.

02:49:40.340 --> 02:49:41.560
Yay, that's all.

02:49:41.560 --> 02:49:43.320
Alright, DDR Angel.

02:49:43.320 --> 02:49:45.880
Alright, uh, well...

02:49:45.880 --> 02:49:51.400
I know you guys have said this FU over and over and over again, but see, now that I live here,

02:49:51.400 --> 02:49:54.240
I really know what you're talking about.

02:49:54.240 --> 02:49:57.260
FUs are the freakin' stupid drivers around here.

02:49:57.260 --> 02:50:06.560
They've almost killed us, like, I don't know, at least five times as I can recall this week while driving around Sacramento, so it's like, wow.

02:50:06.560 --> 02:50:22.260
And, um, also F.U. to the main post office that, eh, I can talk, post office in Sacramento because they, uh, have still decided to hold our mail, so we're not getting all of it like we should be.

02:50:22.260 --> 02:50:25.440
Oh well, I guess that's the

02:50:25.440 --> 02:50:27.020
downside to moving.

02:50:27.020 --> 02:50:28.540
Also,

02:50:28.540 --> 02:50:31.660
Magus wants to send an F.U. to

02:50:31.660 --> 02:50:36.900
big workservers going down, because now he's going to have to explain himself

02:50:36.900 --> 02:50:39.420
on Wednesday

02:50:39.420 --> 02:50:42.980
as to why the server went down for four hours.

02:50:42.980 --> 02:50:47.260
So he's going to have some extra work to do, it looks like. Oh well.

02:50:47.260 --> 02:50:49.460
Alright, I guess that's uh, I don't know.

02:50:49.460 --> 02:50:51.460
I guess that's it. I'm done. Whatever.

02:51:19.460 --> 02:51:21.460
That's so cool.

02:51:49.460 --> 02:51:54.760
information pan duh I counted your vote for song two because I saw that you

02:51:54.760 --> 02:52:01.760
changed it bitch wow that was really brutal I just probably I just totally

02:52:01.760 --> 02:52:08.400
just as one of our listeners yes see now this is crap okay

02:52:10.800 --> 02:52:16.800
all right moving on violent hyper girl says f you to fanboys nephew to

02:52:16.800 --> 02:52:20.500
three-dimensional calculus when it involves solving the moment of inertia in some solid

02:52:20.500 --> 02:52:24.240
object because it involves three intervals, each of which takes almost a third of a page.

02:52:24.240 --> 02:52:28.920
Okay, I'm getting bored here. Also, F you to leaving my friend's birthday party on Saturday

02:52:28.920 --> 02:52:32.040
night. If I didn't have to go to Davis the next day, I would have stayed all night and

02:52:32.040 --> 02:52:35.720
just caught a ride with someone. But yeah, an F you to ants. They need to die. Heart

02:52:35.720 --> 02:52:42.240
raid. By the way, an F you goes to a particular person who acts like they know everything.

02:52:42.240 --> 02:52:47.240
are an idiot, period. I don't like saying F.U.'s to individuals in particular.

02:52:47.240 --> 02:52:50.840
Ry Chan says, F.U. to drama queens that blame the drama on everyone else and break up a

02:52:50.840 --> 02:52:54.840
community in the process. Ooh, I agree with that. F.U. to garbage that is on welfare and

02:52:54.840 --> 02:52:59.840
feels they need to have children because their boyfriend is going to take care of me.

02:52:59.840 --> 02:53:02.960
Amen to that.

02:53:02.960 --> 02:53:07.340
Dark Tetsuya says, F.U. to keyboard hotkeys. I hit one on accident and it shut down my

02:53:07.340 --> 02:53:14.600
on my computer. MJB says, my FU of the week goes to god damn toys and joys dot com for

02:53:14.600 --> 02:53:20.820
sending me my Max 2 Japanese after two weeks of waiting but forgetting to send party collection.

02:53:20.820 --> 02:53:26.500
I hate you toys and joys. You know what, I've got a free copy of fantasy star collection

02:53:26.500 --> 02:53:35.380
out of them. John Field says, FU to Microsoft and XP service pack 2 again because I'm still

02:53:35.380 --> 02:53:38.500
crashing f you to the laws of physics it would be much easier if I didn't need to

02:53:38.500 --> 02:53:45.420
use any fuel to drive my car f you to moving between dorm rooms misty says the

02:53:45.420 --> 02:53:48.940
closest thing to a real f you that I've gotten this week is to myself for not

02:53:48.940 --> 02:53:53.820
being able to think shit up for my RPG and the works of fanfiction I've got

02:53:53.820 --> 02:53:58.180
linaria says f you to physical distance because I found the guy online that I

02:53:58.180 --> 02:54:02.380
really like but he lives hundreds of miles from me

02:54:02.380 --> 02:54:09.380
Dark Knight says, F you to the USA basketball team for getting the ass kicked by Puerto Rico today.

02:54:09.380 --> 02:54:12.380
That is kind of funny.

02:54:12.380 --> 02:54:15.380
Zao Zao, I hope I said that right.

02:54:15.380 --> 02:54:19.380
Zao Zao says, F you to my connection for being so shitty. Fuck you.

02:54:19.380 --> 02:54:26.380
F you, Nickel City, for ripping off Konami and using StepMania.

02:54:26.380 --> 02:54:29.380
Nickel City.

02:54:59.380 --> 02:55:06.380
And lastly, oh, that wasn't even the nephew, but, uh, it was a personal question for me from somebody. So I guess that was the last one.

02:55:06.380 --> 02:55:08.380
Aw. Aw, I know. Sad, huh?

02:55:08.380 --> 02:55:21.380
Wow, uh, about the Toys and Joys' nephew, that's the first time I've actually heard someone, like, negatively bash them except for when I didn't get my controller, but, you know, I got it, like, five days later.

02:55:21.380 --> 02:55:26.140
actually heard someone like negatively bash them except for when I didn't get

02:55:26.140 --> 02:55:32.100
my controller but you know I got it like five days later so it doesn't matter all

02:55:32.100 --> 02:55:36.260
right I have never had a problem with toys and toys when I when we were really

02:55:36.260 --> 02:55:42.380
big into the Sega Aegis 2500 we had ordered a bunch of games from there and

02:55:42.380 --> 02:55:47.460
all of our others arrived they actually sent me an email saying you know fantasy

02:55:47.460 --> 02:55:50.500
star we were out of fantasy star collection would you like to cancel the

02:55:50.500 --> 02:55:53.160
order I said well sure go ahead and cancel it and you know we'll wait on

02:55:53.160 --> 02:55:57.800
that and they had shipped it anyway so we were actually never charged for a

02:55:57.800 --> 02:56:06.560
fancy star collection all right we are done I actually have when I ordered my

02:56:06.560 --> 02:56:14.920
guitar fix controllers I had them two days later all right you that's it for

02:57:09.320 --> 02:57:12.320
Mini Water In Your Asshole Game!

02:57:12.320 --> 02:57:20.460
oh and answer question or catch fire also got third place this is where

02:57:20.460 --> 02:57:26.780
angels thought bubble goes dot dot dot I won what I know me too dot dot dot yeah

02:57:26.780 --> 02:57:29.860
but she had a little help from the rest of us you were gonna say you were gonna

02:57:29.860 --> 02:57:33.260
say the WarioWare thing and nobody got that was much funnier when we said water

02:57:33.260 --> 02:57:40.140
in your asshole that is the WarioWare nevermind I guess it was better than I

02:57:40.140 --> 02:57:42.140
I guess it was better than that BurgerTime thing.

02:57:44.140 --> 02:57:59.140
Alright, and showing the true mentality age of most of our chat room chatters and our listeners, the game that has the word asshole in it wins, so good job.

02:58:00.140 --> 02:58:02.140
I think that's the first time that that's actually happened.

02:58:02.140 --> 02:58:13.140
Other thoughts of mine were like, regulate your bitches mode, you know, where you just get to bitch slap your fucking hoes and shit. I thought that was funny.

02:58:14.140 --> 02:58:15.140
What? Here.

02:58:15.140 --> 02:58:17.140
I could have had whack a hoe.

02:58:17.140 --> 02:58:19.140
No, it's pimpin' hoes mode.

02:58:19.140 --> 02:58:21.140
Pimpin' hoes mode, yeah.

02:58:21.140 --> 02:58:40.140
Or, like, um, my favorite, uh, call the assurance expector, um, at a toy factory mode. Basically, you get to throw in a bunch of, like, sharp razor blades and stuff into, like, the stuffed animals. But, see, you have certain items that you can put in the animals, and you just have to get the right one, you know, depending on what it is.

02:58:40.140 --> 02:58:55.140
I'm thinking of one that's like, there was one of those little Flash games that was where you would have this phallus and shoot into these condoms as they went by. They should have, like, Condom Tester the game.

02:58:55.140 --> 02:59:01.140
Um, Angel, I have some questions for you as the author of, um...

02:59:01.140 --> 02:59:02.140
Oh, shit!

02:59:02.140 --> 02:59:03.140
What?

02:59:03.140 --> 02:59:04.140
What?

02:59:04.140 --> 02:59:05.140
Loki, what?

02:59:05.140 --> 02:59:12.940
Oh, this is, this is like, okay, there's the line, and I'm crossing it, okay, um...

02:59:12.940 --> 02:59:15.140
Do your own abortion mode!

02:59:15.140 --> 02:59:17.800
Stop it!

02:59:17.800 --> 02:59:18.800
You're horrible.

02:59:18.800 --> 02:59:19.800
Alright.

02:59:19.800 --> 02:59:20.900
uh...

02:59:20.900 --> 02:59:23.980
angel as the author of uh...

02:59:23.980 --> 02:59:27.060
uh... many water in your asshole game i have some questions

02:59:27.060 --> 02:59:29.180
uh... have you ever played i toy groove

02:59:29.180 --> 02:59:33.220
no i don't like where group takes pictures and video of you as you play

02:59:33.220 --> 02:59:38.100
would armament many water in your asshole game do the same thing

02:59:38.100 --> 02:59:41.500
okay i don't know what you know that you know um... that you could actually drop

02:59:41.500 --> 02:59:45.100
trial in front of the camera and said that we're going to have a really it

02:59:45.100 --> 02:59:48.620
What was that really fucked up Japanese game that had the vibrator shit?

02:59:48.620 --> 02:59:51.860
Rez? Rez. God.

02:59:51.860 --> 02:59:57.500
I know, like, there's the Abunga game, where you stick the finger in the ass.

02:59:57.500 --> 03:00:01.080
Abunga-bunga. Somebody in our chat room actually suggested that. I saw that go by.

03:00:01.080 --> 03:00:04.560
I can't believe, though, that Abunga actually was, like, a real game and they had a party

03:00:04.560 --> 03:00:07.580
for it and everything.

03:00:07.580 --> 03:00:10.540
My other question about mini water in your asshole game.

03:00:10.540 --> 03:00:14.220
once you get the water in your asshole would you be able to shoot it back out?

03:00:14.220 --> 03:00:20.900
on that note it's about time to end

03:00:20.900 --> 03:00:24.440
the show here so we're gonna go around and get everybody's final

03:00:24.440 --> 03:00:30.740
thought. DDR Angel, your final thought please.

03:00:30.740 --> 03:00:34.140
I did not expect the

03:00:34.140 --> 03:00:37.860
butt thing to win but okay whatever. You just don't know this show well enough

03:00:37.860 --> 03:00:42.180
You've been listening how long now and you're the official historian of the show and you

03:00:42.180 --> 03:00:47.700
don't know that some joke, a dick and fart joke, a dick fart or asshole joke is always

03:00:47.700 --> 03:00:48.700
going to win.

03:00:48.700 --> 03:00:49.700
Always.

03:00:49.700 --> 03:00:50.700
Of course.

03:00:50.700 --> 03:00:51.700
You should know better.

03:00:51.700 --> 03:00:52.700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:00:52.700 --> 03:00:53.700
Okay.

03:00:53.700 --> 03:00:54.700
Well, okay.

03:00:54.700 --> 03:00:56.900
The fact that it was my pick kind of messed it all up.

03:00:56.900 --> 03:00:57.900
I'm like, wow.

03:00:57.900 --> 03:00:59.940
I actually, I don't know.

03:00:59.940 --> 03:01:01.580
People actually chose what I wanted to do.

03:01:01.580 --> 03:01:02.580
All right.

03:01:02.580 --> 03:01:03.580
Get over yourself.

03:01:03.580 --> 03:01:04.580
All right.

03:01:04.580 --> 03:01:08.580
Arkadian42, your final thought, please.

03:01:14.580 --> 03:01:17.580
Things may be looking up, my future may be coming on, yay.

03:01:18.580 --> 03:01:20.580
Loki, your final thought, please.

03:01:25.580 --> 03:01:27.580
I'm... tired.

03:01:28.580 --> 03:01:31.580
I got yogurt. That's gonna suck later.

03:01:31.580 --> 03:01:38.580
I hope you all have a wonderful week, and listen to Orangelan's radio lots.

03:02:01.580 --> 03:02:06.620
By Popular Demand, The Orange On It Radio Rewind, and probably, we're looking, I actually

03:02:06.620 --> 03:02:10.000
might bump it up a little bit to like six o'clock so our East Coast friends don't have

03:02:10.000 --> 03:02:14.380
to stay up so late to hear the show, maybe even five, we'll see.

03:02:14.380 --> 03:02:21.740
My final thought is actually listen to Pump Up The Volume on Tuesday night, starting at,

03:02:21.740 --> 03:02:24.980
I tend to start around a quarter to seven if I get early, but usually pre-show starts

03:02:24.980 --> 03:02:29.580
at seven, show starts at seven thirty, goes to whenever, I will likely be doing homework

03:02:29.580 --> 03:02:36.420
the whole time but uh I'm thinking you know I play a lot of dancy happy crappy

03:02:36.420 --> 03:02:42.540
stuff I'm just gonna go for broke and say screw you RIAA I'm playing Metallica

03:02:42.540 --> 03:02:51.340
S&M concert and like a bunch of hair rock and like some Rumsstein and and I

03:02:51.340 --> 03:02:57.480
don't know I might go in some like Danzig and Henry Rollins just for the

03:02:57.480 --> 03:03:02.880
hell of it. Nothing happy, dancy, poppy for me. Okay, maybe a little bit. Maybe a free

03:03:02.880 --> 03:03:09.280
show. And some inflow. I'll play some inflow to make the inflow people happy. I will play

03:03:09.280 --> 03:03:16.480
some inflow in Crystal K. How's that? It's mostly going to be the Metallica S&M concert

03:03:16.480 --> 03:03:20.160
because that's just really, really freaking rad. That's it.

03:03:20.160 --> 03:03:22.480
Alright. That should be a very interesting show then.

03:03:22.480 --> 03:03:30.480
Oh hell yeah! Excuse me. I used to stay up late watching Saturday Night Live and then Headbanger's Ball.

03:03:30.480 --> 03:03:36.480
And then it was 120 minutes for a long time. So yeah, I remember the days of Headbanger's Ball.

03:03:38.480 --> 03:03:45.480
Alright, the final word of the show, I'm actually going to give it to Angel because she whispered a good one in my ear so I want her to say it.

03:03:45.480 --> 03:03:47.480
Oh, do you want me to say the whole thing or just the one word?

03:03:47.480 --> 03:03:49.480
No, just the one word. The final word of the show is...

03:03:49.480 --> 03:03:50.480
Vortex!

03:03:50.480 --> 03:03:54.480

03:04:40.480 --> 03:04:44.480
For the good thing he's found

03:04:44.480 --> 03:04:49.480
If he is his friend, he can't see it

03:04:49.480 --> 03:04:53.480
She can't do no wrong

03:04:53.480 --> 03:04:56.480
Rhode Island Red is his best friend

03:04:56.480 --> 03:04:59.480
He can't put her down

03:04:59.480 --> 03:05:04.480
When a man wants a chicken

03:05:04.480 --> 03:05:08.480
Spend his very last dime

03:05:08.480 --> 03:05:14.480
Buying her fresh corn down at the grain and feed

03:05:14.480 --> 03:05:19.480
If he'll build a nest for her comfort

03:05:19.480 --> 03:05:23.480
And sleep out in the coop

03:05:23.480 --> 03:05:29.480
If she says that's the way it's got to be

03:05:29.480 --> 03:05:45.480
Well, this man loves his chicken She lays them all the eggs she had

03:05:45.480 --> 03:05:58.480
Tell the farmer that nothing's gone wrong Believe me, she's cockin' just cause she's blind

03:05:58.480 --> 03:06:04.480
When a man loves a chicken

03:06:04.480 --> 03:06:08.480
And people think that it is wrong

03:06:08.480 --> 03:06:11.480
He shouldn't think he speaks

03:06:11.480 --> 03:06:14.480
And words don't belong

03:06:14.480 --> 03:06:19.480
Just when a man loves a chicken

03:06:19.480 --> 03:06:23.480
I know exactly how he speaks

03:06:23.480 --> 03:06:25.480
Hey baby, baby, baby

03:06:25.480 --> 03:06:41.480
When a man loves a chicken, you know exactly how he feels, shacked up into his house with

03:06:41.480 --> 03:06:44.480
the good things he found.

03:06:44.480 --> 03:06:54.480
When a man loves a chicken, people think that he's insane, but all he can do is wing it

03:06:54.480 --> 03:07:18.120
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
