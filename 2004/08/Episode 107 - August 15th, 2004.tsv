5689	7870	And now for our feature presentation.
21711	25335	Orange Lounge Radio Live is now on the air.
26056	32882	Orange Lounge Radio Live is a live talk program dedicated to all things Bomani and Bensum.
33663	40189	Orange Lounge Radio may contain adult content, so you probably shouldn't let your children listen.
41290	49555	If you do let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio, they may turn into evil little demons from hell!
50976	54438	Oh wait, most children already are evil little demons from hell.
59361	64123	Now you see that evil will always triumph, because good is dumb.
64423	66885	Fat, drunk, and stupid is no way to go through life, sir.
67540	70981	He jeopardizes my ability to effectively govern this student body.
71881	74661	Well, makes you look like an ass is what he does, Ed.
75062	75802	Hamburgers!
76582	78722	The cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast.
78982	80343	That was huge.
81303	81823	Cool.
81863	86464	Do you mind if I take my new car for a ride?
86484	90025	Catherine, the only thing you're going to be riding is me.
90525	92305	Have you seen my... Lena?
92625	96266	Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to my underground lair.
96566	97286	So it was you.
98180	100421	DarkSakura, Sky, Loki, Orange Lounge Radio,
121329	128475	We are live, and this is episode number 107 for this August the 15th of 2004.
128575	137703	You're tuned in to the Bee Money Scene's most unexciting radio station of all things, Bee Money.
138824	141286	My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.
141846	147951	Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts in this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Jamie Summers.
147972	149613	You know her better as DarkSakura.
150049	154551	That was very anticlimactic, your little... I know.
156012	156552	We're old.
157913	158353	We're old?
159473	159714	I know.
160574	166077	You realize, you, me, Loki, we're about five years older than the Bomani average, right?
166577	167637	If not, maybe ten.
170038	173420	I don't know if our show's ready for retirement or it's a nursing home or something.
173820	174540	We're still kicking.
174821	176441	I'm going to turn our mics up just a tad.
176481	179863	Do not adjust your volume on your... Okay, we're up a little bit there.
180956	184097	What was I going to say?
184157	185758	Oh, you're ready to quit doing this show?
185778	186298	Oh, okay.
186418	189300	I think you have to bring your hate to the masses.
189340	191381	I'm going to quit for like five seconds.
191441	191801	I quit.
193541	194042	Jamie!
194342	194942	Jamie!
195642	196743	Okay, I'm not quitting anymore.
196763	197143	Okay, good.
198584	200704	Funny enough, that's not the first time she's threatened to quit the show.
200724	201805	No, I'm kidding.
201825	202485	When have I ever?
202565	202885	I'm kidding.
202905	203266	I'm kidding.
204566	204846	All right.
205707	208728	Also joining us is our third co-host, our third wheel.
209232	210833	The Tech Master, Loki!
212694	213114	Hi!
213234	215155	The mic is quite loud today!
216375	218936	That means you do not scream in it, you just talk like normal.
218957	219437	There you go.
220317	221338	You got a loud voice.
221618	224519	You got a loud man voice, so you can take it away from the mouth a little.
224539	229081	The whole show I'm just going to be like, I'm going to mubble.
229401	230002	How's it going?
231422	231902	I'm good.
232323	232923	How's it going?
234912	235433	You going to go?
236574	236994	All right.
237695	240579	Also joining us tonight, we have some very special guests.
241940	243942	We have somebody who hasn't been here in a few weeks.
244002	244703	He's always kind of here.
244924	245985	He's like our mascot.
246045	247587	I think he's kind of like the mascot because he's here.
247827	251411	He doesn't talk a whole lot, but neither does the guy in the chicken suit at the football game.
251491	253774	So I'm dubbing him our mascot.
253854	254855	It's Arcadian42.
256141	257322	Yay, I had gas today.
257422	259624	Oops, I'm in my car and I had gas today.
260004	261125	Can I get a go team go?
262286	265809	Go team... Stop, stop, don't go anymore.
265909	271173	Alright, I'm not going.
271613	273195	And where have you been, young man?
273255	273855	Where have you been?
274936	275777	At my apartment.
275817	277178	You missed a big show last week.
277967	281768	Yeah, I didn't have a guess last week, though.
281808	283468	We actually had a big show last week.
283708	285869	I'm actually afraid to see how many people come back.
286149	289930	Because last week, our show was dominated by this song.
290030	293771	I don't know, this Akira song that I guess was big or something.
294131	295591	We had to play, and there was tons of people here.
295631	300272	So I'm kind of curious how many actually come back to hear what the real train wreck sounds like tonight.
300452	304353	Because on tonight's platter, you guys, absolutely nothing.
307935	308215	Alright.
311396	311676	Alright.
313557	318919	Anyway, also with us tonight, the lovely DDR Angel is back this week.
319099	319479	Hello.
319960	321420	I have cheese-its.
322020	322501	Yeah.
323301	323941	Mmm, cheese-its.
323961	324361	What kind?
324381	326242	Uh, cheddar and jack.
326522	326962	Don't ask.
327903	330764	Alright, we'll be talking to all our guests a little bit more later.
330804	333445	We're going to definitely play some How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day when we come back.
333845	336566	And then I suppose we have some Bomani news too we should take care of.
336929	339250	Attention, John Field, my name is not Jammie.
342312	342792	Thank you.
343513	344273	One M, please.
345354	347695	Jamie, we'll scold you if you want to join our chatroom.
347915	352998	www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on chat, and be berated by the lovely DarkSakura.
353158	353579	This one?
353719	354339	Yes, you're welcome.
354919	358681	Alright, in this break, I thought we could do some booty-rific music from DDR Solo 2000.
360367	361569	because I wanted to hear I'm Alive.
361609	365435	We'll do some Don't Clock Me and maybe some Captain Jack too in this break.
366015	369501	So we'll be back in a little bit with Orange Lounge Radio.
463437	469525	Let's dream a dream together A dream that is real
594545	594886	I want to rock!
640301	642343	Bitch, get a new song.
642403	646025	An open letter from Orange Lounge Radio.
671209	671609	That's right.
671649	672210	Whoa, hello.
672330	673011	That's right, bitch.
673031	675012	Get a new song, Orange Lines Radio.
675593	679676	That's the old school promos back when it sounded like we were talking through two tin cans.
680437	680717	Beautiful.
680838	681758	Because we were at that time.
681798	685101	We were emulating our hero, the tin can lady from DDR Solo.
685221	688044	It's like we have a budget all of a sudden, suddenly here on this show.
688084	688764	It's amazing.
688805	689585	Yeah, two cents.
689605	690286	Give us money.
691557	692257	Give me money.
692417	696378	Actually, I'm thinking about putting a poll on the website next week.
696719	698539	You should go to our website and always take the poll.
698599	700860	And take old polls, too, because polls are important.
701260	704021	But remember, when you're done taking them, give them back.
705301	706521	What is this week's poll, anyway?
706561	706962	I forget.
707042	707982	Over on OrangeLaundry.com.
708002	710383	I think it has something to do with Xbox.
710423	711683	I think it was about that quad mode.
712657	714638	Which we'll talk about later, that quad mode on Ultramix.
714658	717920	Yeah, I want to know what you guys think about quad mode on Ultramix 2.
718100	718900	We'll talk about this later.
719520	721761	We've got to go vote in our poll on OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
721781	726204	There will be a poll coming up soon about who wants to buy an Orange Lounge t-shirt.
726804	731766	Because I happen to have a friend at work who has a friend that owns a t-shirt business.
732387	734067	Who can get us some deals on t-shirts.
734448	737149	I'm thinking about doing a little money making for the show, so...
738228	741789	Especially if we're going to have to raise that cap thanks to last week's show, so we'll see.
742109	743569	Nobody's locked out of the stream tonight, though.
743909	747750	Plenty of spots still available if you have a friend that wants to listen to the show.
748410	748770	Definitely.
749811	751311	And if they don't want to, make them.
751571	751951	That's right.
753051	757432	And certainly, you know, there's all these past polls on the site, too, that you can still go take.
758132	759233	Then we'll see who wants a shirt.
759253	760093	The polls are fun.
760253	760933	Yeah, the polls are fun.
760953	761713	They're interesting.
761833	762113	They are.
763014	764394	In a poll-like way.
764414	764934	Yeah.
766161	768863	Not a whole lot of sites that do DDR polling out there.
768883	772666	I mean, of course there's DDR Freak, but unfortunately we only get one new poll a month there.
773307	775729	And who else does polls on their site?
776169	776870	I can't think of any.
777150	779191	There's a few other, but they're not really Bimani related.
779231	779872	They're not us.
779952	780753	That's the important thing.
780773	781433	Yeah, they're not us.
782654	785617	So go support the Orange Lawn Radio poll.
787078	790500	Of course, tonight, lots to talk about in the Bimani world.
790540	793643	I think what we're going to do tonight, because last week was kind of,
794656	795356	Thanks for watching!
812842	815204	We knew him back in the days of his old nickname.
815224	816625	We listened to him when he was underground.
817686	818507	We saw him dunk.
820709	825953	Well, here's the thing, is that the weekend he comes back, I don't know if I should say what weekend he might come back, because it depends on work.
826413	832138	If it's the weekend I'm thinking it is, it's the weekend that Jamie might be going camping.
832238	834680	Let me put it this way, it's the next weekend we're probably going to do a dunk show.
836261	836922	When would that be?
837742	838623	When I'm going camping.
839003	839664	Oh, you suck!
841814	843395	Alright, alright, we'll see, we'll see.
843795	847297	I want to go... Two weeks we're doing a drug show, or at least I'm doing a drug show.
847377	848678	Do you have Monday off or something?
849518	853020	No, I'll take Monday off on my birthday weekend.
853560	854041	Oh, okay.
854061	856802	Jamie will do... We'll celebrate the crashing of planes.
858863	862425	If I'm here, I'll do a shot of tequila, but I'm not going to drink like I did last time.
864046	865367	You know how I drank last time.
865967	868108	Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, I remember that.
869758	873180	Tequila is not low-carb.
875340	877922	So, we'll have Sigrid back in a few weeks.
878062	886645	But since last week was kind of dominated by him being here, not only that, but us teasing everybody with the Uran thing, and then we also had Pirate Power was here, and who else was here?
887346	888466	Angel was here, Anita.
888766	893789	So we kind of pushed all the Mamani news aside, except for the Uran thing, and hints.
894169	896470	You know, the running gag last week was that everything was a hint.
896870	897050	So...
897805	901088	Now we're actually going to go back and talk about some of the Bimani news from last week and this week.
901108	902670	Because there's been a lot in the past two weeks.
902690	903430	A lot of Bimani news.
903951	905512	I did notice, though, a general consensus.
906113	907795	I think a lot of people like the original better.
908896	909256	I don't.
909516	910537	I prefer the remix.
910777	911578	I do prefer the remix.
911598	912859	I have to say I like the original better.
912959	915902	I think it's certainly better suited for DDR.
916243	917684	Well, yeah, for DDR, but I mean as a song.
918724	920926	I think it would just depend on the mood I'm in.
921427	927273	Like, I think the original works better in the scope of a Silent Hill soundtrack, but the new one works better for a dance-y soundtrack.
927834	928094	True.
929615	933420	We'll play it again tonight, because I know some people may have missed it last week, so we'll play it again tonight at some point.
933440	935542	We won't make you wait two hours this time, we'll play it soon.
936027	946612	but I'll have some other songs we have to play too because, you know, they announced a bunch of stuff for Ultramix and some of you guys, even though they're from 2DX, you haven't heard it before so we definitely want to make sure you hear this before the game comes out.
946792	947112	Oh, Rob.
947312	947452	What?
948172	948312	What?
948553	948713	What?
949193	949353	What?
949573	949733	What?
949953	950133	What?
950293	950413	What?
950433	951334	I'm just getting out of the way early.
955836	956196	Damn it.
957496	959077	My baby won't work for you.
959297	960498	My prop isn't working.
960518	960718	Oh, shit.
962239	963919	All my work is about to fall off the table.
964239	964940	Throw me the baby.
965120	965420	Hold on.
965612	965972	Hold on.
969954	971235	Wee, babies.
972515	974236	Anyway, moving on.
974416	977538	We've got to get this out of the way, though, because this is how we start off every show.
977558	981300	We have to talk a little bit about how was your week, how was your day.
981780	986542	And starting us off, as always, the lovely DarkSakura is going to say how her week was and how her day was.
988123	990044	My week was pretty dull.
991205	992045	Yeah, it was just work.
993528	995569	Except that I started class on Wednesday.
995690	998993	I had my first orientation for one of my online classes.
999113	1008361	And I took another orientation on Saturday and dropped some really retarded class that they're making me take, which was Intro to Windows.
1008421	1011063	When I found out what the last course was, I dropped it so fast.
1011444	1017329	The last assignment in that class, Rob, is How to Rename and Move Files.
1018385	1020085	Wow, that sounds difficult.
1020145	1021766	That sounds really stupid.
1022246	1024986	Like, I know five-year-olds that can rename files, okay?
1025546	1033768	So, I just, I dropped the class, and I'm going to petition the dean next quarter, next semester, to let me test out of it.
1034908	1041189	Since I could do that with, like, you know, Windows 3.1, way back when.
1044210	1045830	I could rename files in DOS.
1046330	1046510	Okay.
1048564	1049945	So, yeah.
1049965	1050646	Remember DOS?
1050846	1051567	Remember?
1051607	1053508	You were using Windows back when it was underground.
1054169	1054789	I sure was.
1055990	1061675	Back when this little, you know, kid in college thought he was brilliant and was going to make a different operating system.
1061695	1064437	Back when they were an indie band, you were using Windows.
1064617	1071964	No, but, um... But I'm going to... There's a bunch of classes I'm going to test out because they're really stupid.
1072564	1075807	But, um... And, uh...
1077045	1088315	I'm also planning on going back to finish... I'm thinking about double majoring, so I'm still sort of considering that.
1088875	1095020	But it's just been work, school stuff, a little bit of personal drama in my life.
1096141	1096742	Nothing major.
1097503	1104749	I've been kind of stressed out, so... But I'm working on trying to stay positive, trying to stay happy...
1105908	1114270	Trying to, you know, not erupt into random bouts of bitchiness over things beyond my control.
1114650	1116171	I have a song to dedicate to you, Jamie.
1116471	1116771	No.
1117731	1118071	What?
1123293	1123693	Why?
1124993	1126134	Because it's no more drama.
1126534	1127354	Haven't you heard this song?
1128834	1131255	Yeah, it's from one of those stupid soap operas.
1131875	1133736	Well, it actually raps on the samples.
1133756	1134356	Hold on, hold on.
1134416	1135056	Let it kick in here.
1139013	1140554	That is desperation, okay?
1141174	1143976	That's almost as bad as when the Sujis ripped that Enya song.
1144816	1145096	Okay?
1145597	1148999	That's really, really bad.
1150399	1150860	Really bad.
1151380	1152941	This definitely should be in a DDR.
1152961	1155102	I know a lot of people that could use... Yeah, that actually would be pretty good.
1155142	1156823	I know a lot of people that could use that song.
1159104	1162206	But, um... Yeah, I don't think that...
1164747	1168310	I don't think that there's anything really all that major that happened in my week.
1168350	1170731	Nothing of notable circumstance.
1170751	1173153	Why aren't you boring?
1173413	1173873	I'm just kidding.
1174454	1175254	Well, bite me.
1176555	1177276	I'm just teasing you.
1177576	1178456	You know, boring.
1180138	1182699	There's a curse that says, may you live in interesting times.
1185802	1186302	Interesting.
1186670	1191695	There's also another one that says, May the fleas of a thousand camels rest in your genitals, but I won't go into that one.
1193217	1194298	I'm going to pass on the mic.
1194538	1195279	All right, moving on.
1196040	1199023	Let's talk to DDR Angel and see how her week and her day was.
1199764	1200244	Angel?
1200905	1201245	Hi.
1201766	1203007	Oh, geez.
1203187	1203828	Okay, here, hold on.
1204133	1205233	Oh, Jamie wants to say one more thing.
1205253	1206534	I broke Dan's main cabinet.
1207014	1207694	How'd you break it?
1207874	1212836	Actually, I pulled the joystick thing loose from the thing with my... You pulled the thing from the thing?
1213517	1220359	The joystick mechanism, I pulled it... It's attached underneath the panel, and I pulled it loose, so it sunk into the panel.
1220619	1220980	Alright.
1221460	1226402	Because his machine could not withstand my mad Street Fighter Alpha 2 prowess.
1226602	1226882	I see.
1229645	1230245	Anyway, hi!
1230386	1231266	Hi, Angel!
1231306	1231727	How was your week?
1231747	1232127	How was your day?
1232247	1232887	Yeah, pretty good.
1233228	1235329	Um, just been working and stuff.
1236930	1239612	Um, I signed up for classes yesterday, so... Yay!
1240893	1246037	So, oh my god, we're all gonna meet in the cafeteria and be like... Lunchtime high school crap.
1246177	1246958	It's like Heather's.
1247678	1248399	Yeah, I guess so.
1248459	1248939	Here, wait.
1249540	1250640	Let the ferret talk for a second.
1253583	1253763	See?
1253823	1254463	He likes it too.
1254483	1256385	Okay.
1256405	1256545	Okay.
1257415	1259556	I still want to set the ferrets on fire.
1259796	1260096	No!
1260716	1261477	No!
1261817	1262117	Anyway.
1263217	1264098	Maybe for Halloween.
1264938	1267619	Just work and going to be school soon.
1267679	1268800	I don't know.
1268820	1270761	My life's pretty boring now that I'm up here.
1272281	1273161	But it's okay, I guess.
1276523	1276803	Okay.
1282885	1283166	All right.
1283206	1284026	Well, moving on then.
1285234	1286554	That was a nice space, Dead Air, thank you.
1286915	1289115	Arcadian42, how was your week, how was your day?
1290355	1303518	Uh, uh, a week has been work, and, and, apartment, uh, work, I've been at this place for about three months, and now they offer me that, uh, that I can be their actual employee instead of a temp.
1304038	1304958	I'm probably gonna take it.
1306158	1306459	Right on.
1306719	1307159	That'd be good.
1309299	1309719	Which is nice.
1312000	1313560	Like, in a few months I get more money, so.
1314244	1314744	That would be good.
1315685	1318566	And not sitting at home all day every day like I usually do.
1319386	1323388	Just go out to the stores and not play anything else.
1323408	1326309	I haven't played any Mimani in like a long time.
1327069	1332992	And because data entry all day doesn't really mesh very well with Beatmania.
1333532	1338434	It's like the only thing I have at home that I can play anymore because I sold everything else.
1339835	1340875	Okay, and that's about all.
1341095	1342516	Today I just sat around
1344056	1344536	I didn't do anything.
1344556	1346157	Just played Final Fantasy.
1346177	1346377	And, uh...
1370133	1373674	I was working on my cabinet because I got the new thing to fix it so there's no lag.
1374375	1377816	But that didn't work too well, so I need to rewire the whole damn thing.
1378236	1380036	Which will, in the end, be better anyways.
1381157	1383338	Because it's a real mess as far as wires go.
1384238	1389920	And, I don't know, just sitting there at work and reading the internet.
1389940	1390880	That's pretty much all I do.
1392841	1394601	Nothing interesting, I'm afraid.
1394982	1396382	Damn, that would suck.
1398942	1399923	Yeah, so what's up?
1401163	1404005	Wow, am I the only one that actually tried to go play some DDR this week?
1404826	1406927	Which is... I played Step Mania.
1407867	1409008	I don't know if Step Mania counts.
1409328	1410749	Step Mania is not DDR!
1411189	1412230	It is not DDR!
1412710	1413711	No, that's a message to everybody.
1413771	1415192	Step Mania is not DDR.
1415512	1417853	If you AAA something in Step Mania, it doesn't mean shit.
1418694	1419034	Okay?
1419414	1419674	Why?
1420735	1421795	Why does it mean shit?
1422216	1423036	Because I said so.
1423276	1424237	Because it's not the same thing.
1424457	1426518	Using your fingers and using your feet are two different things.
1426878	1427639	Well, you're playing on a pad.
1428860	1432042	If you're playing on a pad, it still doesn't count because Stepmania is not DDR and it's different timing.
1433223	1434924	You can actually make the timing exact.
1435644	1437225	So, what do you have to say about that?
1437645	1438626	I think it's a load of crap.
1438726	1439226	It's still not DDR.
1439246	1440147	And you can bite me.
1440167	1440967	So how was your week?
1441408	1441928	Oh, my week?
1444269	1447792	My week, I spent making fun of Stepmania people who say it's DDR.
1447832	1447932	No.
1448132	1448852	Ah, continuation.
1452378	1461626	I forgot to mention, because I'm sure Rob wanted to talk about this anyways, the other thing I was doing this week is researching interdimensional communication.
1462367	1464689	And, yeah, I'm going to build a device.
1467529	1469752	Let me say that again for those that didn't catch it.
1469832	1473696	Loki is studying interdimensional communication.
1474657	1475958	And he's going to build a device.
1475998	1476859	What kind of device?
1476979	1478121	He's zipping in a portal to hell.
1479402	1482025	No, it's a... No, it's not a portal to hell!
1482485	1484147	That's the same thing I said.
1484688	1488131	I said he's building a vortex to hell is what he's making right now.
1488692	1492835	This show is a vortex to hell.
1493015	1498960	I am basically recreating an experiment done by some guy who is now dead.
1498980	1501182	And we know why.
1501502	1502043	Okay, anyways.
1504665	1508127	It's basically called a germanium communicator.
1508708	1514452	The reason why it's called a germanium communicator is because isn't a germanium what you keep gerbils in?
1514632	1515293	It's a plant.
1515313	1517875	You're trying to talk to plants.
1519645	1521227	No, I'm not.
1521247	1521587	Not Geranium.
1521607	1522808	People at my work do that.
1522929	1523809	Germanium.
1525651	1527193	Like German with an I-U-M.
1527293	1528134	Isn't that an element?
1529575	1531177	Exactly, that's what it is.
1531237	1532398	It's an element.
1532498	1536042	It's like one of the... Number 37 on the periodical chart.
1536142	1540847	It has the same compounds as silicon almost.
1541636	1542797	You can make boobs out of it.
1543417	1545199	Silicon, not silicone.
1545739	1546279	God.
1547120	1548561	Adding letters to my stuff.
1548661	1549041	Anyways.
1550062	1560429	No, so I'm gonna buy... I'm buying an ingo of this stuff off the internet since they don't really, you know, sell... Which you can make by synthesizing four of the ore plus a fire crystal, just for the record.
1561770	1563772	And you say, I'm a Final Fantasy addict.
1563872	1564252	God.
1564792	1567374	So I'm buying an ingo of this stuff.
1567394	1568435	Basically what it does...
1568965	1570305	Thank you for watching.
1570325	1570825	See you next time.
1590109	1591650	So I don't see why it wouldn't work now.
1592471	1595533	I know everyone thinks I'm crazy, but I'm gonna laugh at you when it works.
1595913	1596734	I'm gonna laugh at you.
1596914	1597794	How do you know if they're dead?
1598255	1599235	What if they're really demons?
1599836	1600496	Well, here's the thing.
1601077	1603919	What if you're picking up, like, a baby monitor upstairs or something?
1606000	1607001	I hear something noise.
1607021	1613605	Well, that's funny you should mention that, because this in no way can pick up radio waves or, you know, any sort of broadcast of that form.
1613665	1617328	It only picks up, um, I think magnetic frequencies, so...
1618823	1620623	Sorry, it doesn't work that way.
1620683	1622344	You can't tune radio with this.
1622444	1624744	Do you have Final Fantasy XI in hell?
1626445	1627185	No, it's hell.
1627205	1627885	Of course we have it.
1627985	1631105	Anyways, I will post in the chat room the website that I'm going to.
1631125	1635346	They actually have recordings of this that's been done a while back.
1635586	1644468	And funny enough, the guy that was basically doing this, who also won a Nobel Prize and has a PhD in experimental sciences... All things that you don't have.
1645068	1646088	All things that I don't have.
1646689	1648129	I don't fucking care, okay?
1648669	1659277	Because what I don't have, I'm going to make better because his device only had, you know, a small little piece that was a two millimeter by three and a half millimeter piece of germanium.
1659778	1662340	I'm using an inch by an inch piece of germanium.
1662400	1664221	It's 25 times the size.
1664542	1666543	I'm just multiplying everything by 25.
1666944	1668605	So are you an advocate that bigger is better?
1669466	1672368	Notice how Loki has taken what you do for cookies.
1672488	1676191	Like when you have too much cookie dough, you just double the recipe for everything, right?
1676815	1682718	He's taken that and now he's going to multiply everything on this talking to the dead communicator by 25.
1685559	1687480	He's going to build a vortex to hell, I'm telling you.
1687920	1698104	So basically he's applying the math behind cookie dough to metaphysical communication.
1698224	1698445	Yes.
1699730	1706072	Now, what I suggested over dinner when Loki was telling us the first time is that we could take this device to Golf Land and really mess with people.
1706412	1714195	Like, I think we should hook it up so that it's in that area between the pad and the screen so when little kids run in front of it, they get sucked into hell.
1716836	1722318	Okay, first off, like I said before, it's not a fucking vortex to hell.
1723279	1726600	That's another device to which I do not have the schematics for.
1727028	1728009	Can you build one of those?
1728029	1731050	Because I really want to get rid of some of those people at Golfline.
1731130	1732191	Didn't you ever see the gate?
1733472	1735273	You have to dig a hole in your backyard.
1735533	1736353	Okay, listen now.
1736994	1740395	Honestly, seriously, I am interested in this stuff.
1740515	1746099	I don't know if it's a phase or something, but I am so fucking bored at work, I have nothing to do.
1746579	1748200	And this is what they're forcing me to do.
1748420	1749981	So first it's cursed dolls.
1750841	1752622	Now it's communicating with the dead.
1752842	1753823	You can touch your dolly.
1757148	1761312	Oh my god, that's what this is all about, is that Loki needs to talk to his dolls.
1762553	1763834	Oh, you're a genius, Jamie.
1764274	1768898	First off, I don't have any haunted dolls, because I forgot to bid on the goddamn thing in the beginning.
1769519	1777465	And second of all... Second of all, okay, this doesn't have anything to do with fucking talking to dolls, okay?
1779008	1779608	Goddammit.
1779628	1783511	Don't you want to talk to the demon or dead thing that possessed the doll?
1783671	1785972	I'm loving this chatroom feedback we have here.
1786853	1788974	I thought there already was a vortex to hell.
1789054	1790355	It's called Roseville Golf Land.
1791448	1792409	That's the Bomani.
1792429	1794271	That's where Bomani machines go to die.
1794752	1796594	Scandia is where Bomani goes to die.
1797215	1799177	Scandia is where Bomani goes to die again.
1799537	1800338	Like, re-death.
1801279	1802040	Alright, listen now.
1802461	1802681	Okay.
1803362	1809929	This basically, all this is right here, it's another form of EVP, as I was talking before, which is, you know, electronic voice phenomenon.
1809949	1812092	It's basically, what happens is you can record...
1813001	1814822	You record voices that you don't hear.
1815262	1820644	And they're done through manipulation of the diaphragm and a microphone.
1820704	1825846	Basically, you can record things that normal humans can't hear.
1825866	1827607	They do this all the fucking time.
1829708	1831508	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1852294	1853635	and don't even yet, okay?
1853915	1856117	Anybody can do this with a tape recorder.
1856557	1865464	They can do this, and you can actually wire something up very simple with a germanium diode that they supposedly sell at Radio Shack, but I sure as hell could find it today.
1865924	1874651	Anyways, you can do that, and it'll actually only record just, you know, what you can't hear, and it'll block everything else out.
1874932	1878795	And it's very interesting hearing people do that, and you get some really creepy shit on there.
1880493	1882175	Butcher, mock me as you will.
1882776	1884778	I will fucking send the vortex after you.
1885359	1887842	Speaking of mocking Loki, we have a comment from the chatroom.
1887862	1888843	This is the best comment ever.
1888863	1891647	UnknownGamer says, Loki does want to talk to his dolls.
1891687	1896012	He wants to talk to his Final Fantasy figurines and see if Tifa and Yuna love him.
1897234	1898615	I don't even have dolls.
1899503	1900504	And that's stupid.
1900784	1904066	He wants to talk to his chocobo to see if his chocobo goes work at him.
1904086	1904647	Can I make a joke?
1904667	1906668	Can I make a joke?
1906728	1907128	Okay.
1907769	1912772	If you're able to build this machine and talk to the dead, will you be able to communicate with Miss Cleo's career?
1916635	1917035	Yes.
1919497	1920117	You know what?
1920978	1921578	Enough of this.
1922526	1925668	I'm just reminded of that scene from Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey.
1925768	1926869	To hell with all you people.
1926889	1927750	No, no, don't say that!
1929091	1930792	Don't say that, Loki, because you will do it.
1930912	1932273	I know you will with this machine.
1933073	1935775	No, but like that scene when they're having the seance.
1936275	1939698	Honestly, Rob, how many things have I built that have actually worked?
1941139	1942039	That's a very good point.
1942480	1948624	You know, in defense of Loki's little idea, I'm supporting it.
1949264	1950045	I'm curious...
1951101	1952182	Is this what we're calling it now?
1952222	1954103	It's officially the little idea?
1955704	1956525	Your little idea.
1958706	1959127	Okay.
1959487	1961068	I will support this.
1961128	1962789	I'm interested to see how it turns out.
1963310	1970755	But I'm also wondering, though, what you would use to record visual data.
1971204	1972665	Actually, they have that.
1972925	1973245	Really?
1973446	1974026	It's been done.
1974466	1976307	And it's really strange how it works, too.
1976467	1979069	It's basically everything revolves around white noise.
1979509	1997581	In this case, what they use, a common way they use to record it, they have some other complicated devices, but the easiest way you can do it now is you take a video camera and you record, you basically put the output onto a TV, then you record that, and it creates interference because it's recording the same fucking thing over and over.
1998181	2002805	But in that, when you record that, you go back frame by frame and you'll actually see shit on there.
2002845	2005167	And they have pictures of it that have been done.
2005487	2006368	It's very interesting.
2006408	2017196	But the guy that did the experiments, he actually had his own device because this is like way back in the day when TVs and shit were fucking expensive and computers were the size of football fields and whatnot.
2017877	2018017	Um...
2018493	2022956	We need to have to take a bazillion magnets and put them in a room to make a kilobyte.
2023196	2033402	So basically, this is something he made a while back, and supposedly what happened was later on people recreated this experiment in the 90s.
2033882	2037404	The most recent I've heard of this experiment being recreated was in 2003.
2038184	2038825	I don't really know.
2039285	2047750	I guess for some reason, for a few years they had no results recreating the same thing, because there's a lot of other factors that they can't figure in, that they don't know what the hell...
2048393	2050094	You know, why it doesn't work or why it works.
2050174	2051274	It goes to camera shy?
2051554	2052795	No, it's not camera shy.
2053735	2054295	It's complicated.
2054315	2055736	Anyway, I'll give you guys the websites.
2055756	2056656	You can go look at it.
2057016	2058096	You can think I'm crazy.
2058136	2058717	That's fine.
2058777	2060397	But this is what I'm reading up on.
2060637	2064859	And, I mean, I'm not a real believer in the paranormal and whatnot.
2064899	2066619	But I'm a believer in science.
2066999	2069540	And, you know, they have scientific proof to prove this.
2069640	2070681	They just can't explain it.
2070861	2073222	It's obviously beyond our knowledge now.
2073762	2074062	So...
2075164	2076607	I don't know, it just sounds interesting.
2077049	2080317	If it's so easy to recreate the experiment, then why not?
2082219	2083360	But yeah, I'm crazy.
2083720	2086341	But the thing is, though, there's another guy.
2086361	2097426	There's another guy that created a thing called Luminator, which is basically... It's some sort of device that... It uses fans or something, and it blows water through rings of water.
2097786	2099307	Or air through rings of water.
2099607	2107691	I don't know how the fuck that happens, but... Anyway, supposedly that creates a weird field or something, and if you photograph someone with that field, you'll actually see...
2108411	2110313	Like someone else's face on theirs.
2110373	2110994	It's kind of weird.
2111435	2120404	Then the guy supposedly put three of these in like a triangle configuration and that created the vortex, you know, that you were also talking about.
2121065	2122106	And he saw the Triforce.
2122186	2122326	No.
2122787	2129074	But, um, I was going to ask something about the... I lost my train of thought because I made the Triforce joke.
2129654	2130315	Never mind, keep talking.
2131272	2133434	Anyways, I will post the links in the chat room.
2134816	2136637	But there's some interesting stuff.
2136717	2142143	There's a whole bunch of stuff on EVPs that you can listen to that are really creepy sounding stuff.
2143124	2145126	But it's a lot of documentation on this.
2145146	2147127	There's a lot of people recreating it the same way.
2147728	2150791	So, I mean, you're getting a lot of people that are getting these results.
2150851	2152773	I mean, scientifically, you can prove it.
2153193	2155776	Is it like the dead boy in Three Men and a Baby?
2156836	2157256	Uh, what?
2159017	2165920	You know what I was thinking is that you should take this whole little idea of yours and you should film it all and put it on like public access TV.
2165940	2167240	You could be the new Mr. Wizard.
2167440	2168100	Wouldn't that be cool?
2170861	2171142	No.
2173322	2174843	No, but, um, you know...
2176336	2201454	I don't know, their results were just kind of like weird because one thing that they were saying that's important about this is resonance and anyone that doesn't know what resonance means that's just like, for example, resonance on a radio would be tuning in because you have all the frequencies out there and each station has its own frequency so you tune it to whatever station and then you're in resonance with that station and you basically get audio that way.
2201574	2204897	Well, the thing with this is you have to be resonance with
2205569	2216572	Your thoughts or basically your aura or whatever, and that's the thing that's difficult because it's not only you, it's the people around you, and those all affect your environment plus other factors.
2217713	2221654	So it's a lot of complex shit there, but I don't know.
2222154	2226075	I'm going to do it until I get bored with it, and then I'll work on my cabinet some more.
2227075	2228636	I'm ready to talk about my week and my day now.
2228676	2229396	You got my joke.
2229876	2230276	What joke?
2231577	2233477	Didn't you ever see the thing about three men and a baby?
2234598	2234758	No.
2235058	2235278	Loki?
2236982	2256603	about the one scene where they're walking in front of a window and there's a little boy standing behind this curtain and he was supposed to have been like some ghost who imprinted himself on the film he like blew his head off with a shotgun or something and then they walk by again I've seen it, the shotgun's there you're crazy talking
2257620	2258342	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
2269926	2271948	Oh god, now you got Loki on another thing.
2272468	2274930	Now he's going to start inserting ghosts into movies.
2275230	2279614	Well, no, seriously, because he's like, and you can fully see him there.
2280274	2289521	And I wouldn't just say this if I had, I mean, I'm sure that the logical thing is that it's some prop or something, but the other is that, see?
2293044	2293645	Interesting.
2293705	2294465	Didn't I tell you?
2295906	2297047	It shows up several times.
2297067	2299109	Can you post that link in our chat room for those that want to check that out?
2299791	2300212	Alright.
2300872	2301172	Anyway.
2302634	2303595	Your week, Rob.
2303635	2304195	Yes, my week.
2304315	2306417	I actually went out and played DDR this week, one night.
2306437	2306917	Holy shit, you did?
2306958	2310941	I went to Roseville Golf Land, because my friend had never seen DDR before.
2311481	2315305	Well, I mean, actually, he'd seen DDR, but he wanted to see me play DDR, because he hadn't seen, like, Extreme.
2315365	2318428	So I went, and I played, and I felt really stupid.
2318888	2325694	Like, I don't know how you guys feel about playing DDR for your friends for the first time, when you're, like, pretty good at DDR, like...
2326418	2330441	I can play at a maniac level like I'm sure a lot of people listening to this show can.
2331842	2335745	And to those that don't really see DDR a whole lot, I think it really weirds them out sometimes.
2335805	2336185	I don't know.
2336206	2337627	Maybe it's just me.
2339188	2340929	But he seemed to get a kick out of that.
2341009	2345612	But the thing was that the up arrow on Extreme was broken, so like half my notes weren't registering.
2345933	2350896	And then I went to try and play Guitar Freaks, and frickin' that machine was suckin' too, so...
2352157	2353018	The hell with that place.
2354199	2355079	Machines go to die.
2355440	2357061	But I did at least go out to play DDR this week.
2357101	2359743	I was going to try and play at home, but my stupid ignition pad's broken.
2359823	2364106	So either I'm going to have to buy a new ignition pad, or Loki's going to have to finish his DDR pads.
2364146	2368489	But since he's too busy building vortexes to hell, it's probably not going to happen anytime soon.
2368509	2370591	I was going to work on that, and that's why I'm rewiring everything.
2371111	2371731	Sure, alright.
2373012	2373393	We'll see.
2376175	2376475	Anyway...
2376952	2380333	I guess that's pretty... I don't really have a whole lot to say about my week and my day.
2380393	2382294	It wasn't that exciting.
2382314	2385856	I had a fine weekend.
2385916	2388817	I went to a little gathering last night and that was cool, I guess.
2388977	2392418	And then two days ago... What did I do Friday night?
2392478	2397020	I went out to a party with some friends and then went to a bar.
2397900	2398641	Isn't that exciting?
2399861	2400181	That's it.
2400702	2401682	Excitement is now.
2402963	2404783	They have pinball machines at this bar now, though.
2405063	2405444	Which ones?
2406444	2406544	Uh...
2408374	2415017	Monopoly, and the one with the aliens in the hologram, Revenge of Mars.
2417298	2419639	But it's just kind of funny to see those at a gay bar.
2421080	2425622	If anybody in town happens to find a Black Knight 2000 pinball, tell me.
2426602	2431364	Because Black Knight 2000 pinball is the most awesome pinball ever.
2432096	2435459	Maybe they'll have one at the Classic Gaming Expo, which you know we're going to be making an appearance at.
2435479	2435959	Woohoo!
2435979	2436980	Classic Gaming Expo!
2437040	2437901	Alright.
2439022	2440222	Konami's supposed to be doing something there.
2440242	2441383	Yes, Konami is doing something there.
2441784	2444566	Some of our buddies at KDA are actually working the booth there.
2446347	2447128	They're working a booth.
2448029	2451231	I sort of know what's going on, but I think it's supposed to be a secret, so I can't repeat it.
2451371	2452292	It's a secret to everyone.
2452352	2454974	It's not Bimani related, but it's very cool nonetheless.
2454994	2455895	Unless we play track and field.
2456736	2458477	That would be cool.
2458697	2459378	That would be awesome.
2459538	2459798	Alright.
2461868	2463050	But I definitely want to go.
2464131	2466132	So we'll be making an appearance there next weekend.
2466593	2469455	It may affect next week's show, actually, but we're not sure yet.
2469495	2470957	We think we might still have a show next weekend.
2472118	2473439	But Jamie's still going to be there.
2476782	2484750	I'm actually going to be there partly for the show and partly with my fiancé.
2485010	2485190	Right.
2488346	2492128	We'll have to pre-tape a show if we decide to be at Classic Gaming Expo all next week.
2492208	2493128	So, we'll figure something out.
2493709	2493969	Alright.
2495429	2497010	I think what we do now is we're going to go to break.
2497410	2499431	And when we come back, we'll actually talk about some Bomani stuff.
2499451	2504253	Because there's been lots of Ultramix 2 news and DDR Extreme news this week.
2504634	2510336	Speaking of DDR Extreme, I think in this break we're going to play some music from DDR Extreme, including... Why not?
2510476	2511797	We'll do Your Rain the Rage Mix again.
2512045	2513026	You touched my body once, it burned
2589463	2590704	Thanks for watching!
2623233	2624818	What you see is me, baby
2684806	2692292	All my brothers and sisters, all in all, over 10 billion listeners, many a year, we do want to hear the hypest and ripest sound of the year.
2692312	2694354	Up and kiss the butt of the agent, up, up, up.
2715601	2742591	Okay y'all, this is it, I fucked it, it's a life we'll see soon as I touch it Through this smooth and easy life, so we might get hyped in here tonight Be nice, be light, MC for the back, if you ain't with that, I'ma have to attack you with a bad rap That can smash this mouth up, if they jack, we don't start no crap Giving a little bit of heart and soul, as we do it, so you in your ear holes
2748907	2749811	Thank you for watching!
2786926	2790128	After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move Marathon.
2790449	2792610	No!
2792690	2793330	Just kidding.
2793791	2794812	Orange Lounge Radio.
2794892	2796513	Crap-free Bavani Radio.
2797794	2799935	Yes, mostly crap-free, except for this show, of course.
2800535	2805039	You are tuned in to Orange Lounge Radio, and we're here with episode number 107.
2806587	2810509	I went to take a little break there talking about some new songs that are going to be in DDR Extreme.
2811310	2812350	Well, you know, not all new.
2812370	2817273	Of course, Your Rain was new, but we have some old classics there, Never Ending Story and Wonderland.
2817753	2823617	I noticed this kind of seems to be happening quite a bit where they're getting a lot of old songs and putting them in these new DDR games we have coming out.
2823997	2826178	What else did we have in Extreme that was going to be in there?
2826639	2834943	Well, Only You, There You'll Be, Kick the Can, Don't Clock Me from Solo, like all these old-ass songs.
2834963	2835844	I think it's kind of cool, though.
2837928	2841693	Sugaru, that's kind of old now, I don't know, .59.
2843094	2852205	Alright, so we are here on Orange Orange Radio and kind of talking about some news that happened last week.
2852245	2854948	I wanted to talk about some things that happened while we were here.
2856684	2857545	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2875647	2885229	And it's got all these different songs in there, a new DJ Simon song, Back to the Dance Floor, new Orange Lounge songs in it, new Naoki song, and all this stuff in 2DX Red.
2885609	2891230	And supposedly there's this really, really hard song that's in it, that has this really hard note pattern.
2891510	2897132	And actually, one of my buddies was kind enough to send me a video of it, so I'll show you guys kind of what this looks like.
2897172	2898372	Now he's playing it on random.
2898712	2903074	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2925265	2928146	I will, I guess, read just your eyesight or something, the way you can read it easier.
2928326	2930146	Let me show you what the end of the song looks like here.
2931586	2933747	Actually, that part doesn't look so hard, but kinda, there you go.
2935147	2936668	Kinda crazy song in the end there.
2941168	2941769	I like the video.
2943249	2946010	Yeah, it looks like they've made the interface a lot prettier.
2946490	2952411	That they have the, um, barred... They, they, basically what they did in 2DX Red, I noticed, is that they took...
2953386	2965109	One half of the screen, you remember when you would play 2DX, the side, if you were just in one player mode, the other half of the screen would have nothing, like it would just be a blank place for notes to fall.
2965129	2967710	Well, what they've done is they've kind of done the keyboard mania thing.
2967730	2977692	I don't know how many of you guys have played keyboard mania, but keyboard mania had two monitors, and if you were playing it just in one player mode, it would show you like a little bar on the other side that would show you like how you were doing with your combo and stuff.
2978072	2986403	It's not quite that what they're doing in 2DX Red, but they've taken it, and now it's showing a graph of your score compared to the top score on the machine.
2986764	2992351	So I thought that was kind of cool, is that you'd have a little bar that would go up as you did really good or really crappy on the song.
2992732	2994354	So, I thought that was kind of neat.
2996129	2997890	FoonMix
3022782	3023543	FoodMix Plus.
3023603	3025084	There was a FoodMix Plus release last week.
3026245	3027386	It was fucking awesome.
3027426	3028627	That's all I have to say.
3029007	3037834	There was about 15 new songs that they added, brand new interface, brand new non-stop ONI courses, and it's beautiful.
3038414	3044219	They made what FoodMix was before, which was really awesome and made it even better.
3044319	3046301	It's just really kick-ass.
3046361	3050304	From what I hear, though, the double steps leave a little bit to be desired, but
3051331	3054032	Their single sets are awesome because I haven't gotten to play doubles yet.
3054572	3057572	But really beautiful, awesome brand new videos.
3058072	3059673	Just really awesome.
3059793	3062613	They've got a lot of nifty stuff that you can do now in Step Mania.
3063073	3069474	Like, for instance, the results screen has a type of graph that you would see in Beat Mania where it shows you how you did and everything.
3070215	3071575	And your combo and all that.
3071875	3075376	And just some really cool stuff that they did with the background.
3075676	3077676	Just really pushing Step Mania to its limits.
3080805	3091977	I noticed something interesting they did with the movies, is that they put a watermark of the song name in there, like at least that one for Made and Innocent that had the anime girl in it and stuff, they kind of put a watermark on the movie.
3092217	3095661	Was there an issue where some of their movies were being pirated on other step files or something?
3096281	3097643	No, it was just a little cool thing in the bottom.
3098804	3099124	That's all.
3099184	3100466	It was just for the one song, it just...
3101098	3129394	look cool but it was just they actually what I like about them is they use video and still images just like you would in BMS files because I mean these guys are coming from BMS files and just the animations that they do in that are just awesome I really wish a lot of the US people would go and start doing BMS sim files first and then going to DWIs but it's just amazing the amount of work that they put in these
3132486	3141812	I thought maybe all of their movies had the little watermark in the corner because their movies are so kick-ass.
3141872	3145954	I wouldn't be surprised if people were stealing them and putting them on their own step files and stuff.
3146374	3147995	So it kind of ties it to that one song.
3148015	3149656	But it was just the Made in Innocence that had that?
3149716	3150617	I thought I saw it on another one.
3151992	3152913	Alright, so I'm on crack.
3152953	3153353	I don't care.
3153574	3158218	There's a few of them that say Foon Mix Plus in them, but that's about... I mean, so what?
3158338	3158678	Who cares?
3158939	3159639	It's just awesome.
3160400	3161221	That's pretty much it.
3161281	3163483	They just have really awesome stuff.
3163503	3169469	Like I said before, a lot of the music that's actually featured on there is going to be on Diverse 7, which you can find.
3169829	3174614	And that comes in three different varieties, which I could talk about now or later, either way.
3174634	3174854	Sure, why?
3175374	3175935	Thanks for watching!
3190370	3199093	is that they either have three CDs, and I think two of them are BMS files, which are basically your Beatmania sim files, and they're really awesome.
3199153	3202694	Like, for instance, we'll go down with 5Key and what they have on there.
3203314	3210797	We have a remix of Superhighway called Superhighway the Cafe Electromix by a guy named Oni, or Only, I should say.
3212118	3216299	A remix of What's Next with the song title What?
3217034	3218115	Keep On Movin' Romantic Blue Style T.O.
3218175	3219016	Na Remix of Area Code
3233372	3241963	Ska, The Good Mix, Ninja Blast, Hayabusa Mix, Acid Bomb, The Overdosing Remix, Slash Trax,
3252715	3257119	Recycle, a remix of Cycle by Spelunker, which is awesome.
3257139	3259001	He's done some really good stuff.
3259741	3264485	SDZ, which is The Gleam, which is a remix of SDZ.
3264545	3266307	I'm not familiar with that one.
3266707	3266947	And then...
3268628	3269969	Oh man, I'm going to fuck this up.
3270569	3273491	Notch Music, which is You Gotta Groove remix.
3274751	3277052	And that's, of course, a remix of You Gotta Groove.
3277953	3281474	And then Seven Keys, some of the other ones that they have on here.
3281494	3282935	They have a remix of Murmur Twins.
3284036	3286377	Oh hey, we've got some demo MP3s here.
3287157	3288718	But I'll get those later.
3288758	3290719	We can play them maybe during a break or something.
3290759	3294240	Anyways, Murmur Twins, the 4-6-0 beat mix.
3295081	3296401	Reality, the Alpha 0.2 mix.
3298371	3300092	Some other song in Japanese.
3300652	3303413	Bad Boy Bass, the Switchback to 93 remix.
3303934	3309336	Maiden Innocent, which is featured in Spoon Mix Plus.
3309696	3312398	I just hope that Bad Boy Bass remix has that sample still in it.
3312478	3313698	One more time with the Bad Boy Bass!
3313938	3315099	One more time with the Bad Boy Bass!
3316332	3320175	YSQ, Number 12.8, Holix, Loveheart Sign, X2, and Small Voyager
3336205	3340506	And then they have one last one, which is other mixes.
3340907	3349169	And that's Time Piece Phase 2, High Transparency Mix, which is One Phase Blues, I think, remix.
3349549	3352350	Healing Vision remix, which is just that.
3352470	3353290	Over the Drive.
3353970	3357251	Mirrorball Satellite 2004, which is in the original Foon mix.
3357731	3359732	That sounds awesome, because that's an inflow song.
3360123	3361584	Yeah, and it was pretty good.
3362524	3364065	Then there's a few other ones I'll see here.
3364205	3368687	Yama Da Jet, Coaster Girl, which is a Yama Jet remix.
3368747	3369268	It's kind of funny.
3369968	3375931	Implantation, DV Mix, Lamb of God, Trip Machine, Dark Core Mix, and some other ones.
3376451	3381814	But I'm going to get some of these demo MP3s and maybe play them on a break or something.
3381834	3385296	Because they're usually about 30 seconds long, so we'll get a bunch of different songs there.
3386556	3387557	Sure, that sounds like fun.
3387617	3387937	Why not?
3387957	3389638	All right, we'll do that.
3392097	3401004	I'm going to change gears here because I want to talk about Ultramix 2 because the Ultramix 2 news has been flying really fast this week.
3401044	3407009	There's been a lot of new stuff announced for Ultramix 2 within this week and last week, and that's including some songs.
3407770	3412974	Some new songs have been announced for these games, so I want to see if we can address what some of those songs are.
3413875	3413995	Um...
3414858	3429286	Some things that have been figured out is that we got some early songs that have been announced for Ultramix 2, including 321 Stars by DJ Simon, A by DJ Amuro, and B4U by Naoki, which were all, if I remember right, in the E3 demo, so none of that's a surprise.
3430006	3435449	But get this, here's your first licensed song from Ultramix 2, Brick House by The Commodores.
3436669	3437290	Isn't that crazy?
3437930	3440031	That's kind of, is it like a remix of it?
3440071	3441752	No, it's the original, she's on brick.
3442661	3446505	Moonlight Shadow by Missing Heart from Fifth Mix
3468223	3469284	Very popular licensed track.
3469304	3469965	That makes me happy.
3469985	3471206	Yeah, very popular licensed track.
3471366	3474288	Getting a lot of people really geared up for Ultramix, too.
3474328	3475249	Very happy about that.
3475969	3480873	My Summer Love, Night in Motion, which was actually a licensed track.
3481073	3482455	Night in Motion, cool.
3482515	3488099	A lot of people think that that is a Konami original, but it was actually a licensed track from DDR4thMix.
3488660	3493323	And you would know this song, definitely, because it has that really catchy hook at the beginning of it.
3493363	3494084	Here's a little bit of it.
3494484	3494945	Wait, let me...
3497810	3499071	Let me get a little bit of the hook here.
3503013	3512178	Everybody knows that song.
3512198	3514779	Alright, so that one's going to be in a DDR Ultra Mix.
3515840	3519162	Right on the Light by Mr. T. Now, wait a minute.
3519602	3522684	That's a 2DX song that's being ported over for DDR.
3522804	3523164	That's cool.
3523763	3526845	So that is something brand new that we've never had in DDR before.
3527185	3528986	And it doesn't stop there.
3529266	3531647	Route 80s by Sampling Masters Mega.
3531687	3532327	Cool.
3532427	3533408	From DDR.
3533528	3534449	Attention.
3534529	3535629	Attention.
3535749	3537150	We're actually going to play some of these songs.
3537170	3538130	For those of you that haven't heard them.
3538150	3538971	Do that for the next break.
3539191	3540071	Yeah, we'll do that in the next break.
3540091	3541932	We're going to play some of these songs for those that haven't heard them before.
3542493	3545874	Star Mine by Ryu from 2DX4 style.
3545914	3546435	You remember that?
3546475	3547695	With Tran with a little fan.
3549176	3549936	Star Mine will be fun.
3550317	3551677	That's going to be very fun on DDR.
3556043	3584627	Act 6 to do stuff well this is the interesting thing is that they have said they have said in the thread that different people are doing the steps than did them for Ultramix 1 so you're not going to see steps like you saw in Ultramix 1 and supposedly they have people that know their stuff on DDR that are making these steps so so it's not Konami of Hawaii well they didn't really I don't think they really said one way or the other I haven't been keeping tabs on the information thread um
3585686	3589348	and also I don't want to cross the line from what I've been told.
3591870	3593251	I don't know what I can say and what I can't.
3593311	3596873	So I'm just going to move on to the next song, which is from 2DX.
3597374	3599595	VJ Army by Good Cool.
3599635	3600335	Now that's cool.
3600415	3601396	VJ Army will be fun.
3601596	3602437	VJ Army is going to be fun.
3602457	3604978	A lot of people have said that should be in DDR for a long time.
3605439	3607380	So that's very cool that that one's going to make it in there.
3608744	3614208	So, it's okay if you've never played 2DX and you've never heard these songs before, we're going to play them for you in the next break.
3614488	3616609	So you can get a feel of what you're going to be dancing to pretty soon.
3617750	3619751	Goddammit, does that mean I have to buy an Xbox?
3620251	3622293	This is very interesting.
3623653	3627135	When Ultramix 2 was first announced, a lot of people were like, yeah, whatever.
3627516	3634780	Because I think Ultramix was very successful for those that already had an Xbox, but it didn't really convert a whole lot of people.
3636084	3636685	I'm an exception.
3636765	3639207	I did buy an Xbox pretty much so I could play Ultramix.
3639247	3639908	Ultramix and Halo.
3640108	3642231	This new one sounds like it's going to be a big selling point.
3642411	3646775	But this new one, Microsoft should be sucking Konami's cock for this one.
3646835	3647316	Seriously.
3647676	3650079	Because they're going to sell a lot of Xboxes with this mix, I think.
3650439	3651821	Based on DDR fans alone.
3652161	3653643	Microsoft better put out.
3654023	3654544	Seriously.
3654644	3655705	Microsoft should be putting out.
3657518	3664780	It's... I don't know, maybe I should put a poll up over and see how many people are seriously contemplating buying an Xbox just because of Ultramix 2.
3665260	3672922	Because a lot of people were saying, when Ultramix 2 was first announced, yeah, yeah, yeah, great, Ultramix 2, yeah, whatever, you know, Xbox people will enjoy it.
3673322	3680844	But now that the song list is starting to come out and people are like, whoa, we're getting Moonlight Shadow and these 2DX songs that have never been in DDR before...
3682316	3684877	Actually, I have to agree with Kyle in the chat room.
3685297	3687917	I think I actually wouldn't mind seeing Get On Beat Wildstyle.
3688297	3690478	Actually, I wouldn't mind seeing the original Get On Beat.
3691718	3693678	Well, this certainly is not the full list.
3693698	3697059	This is just what we know so far about Ultramix 2.
3698099	3698659	Or Lab.
3698719	3699700	They need to put Lab.
3701300	3704581	Here's one thing I think is kind of different about Ultramix 2.
3705021	3706481	They just announced this this week.
3707202	3710325	There's going to be a brand new dance mode in Ultramix 2.
3711005	3713527	What makes an Xbox different than a PlayStation 2?
3715269	3721755	Other than the obvious Microsoft and... It has... You can store a small family inside of it.
3722755	3723316	Besides that.
3723726	3726287	It has a really big hard drive and four ports.
3726567	3730429	Ah, it has four ports, as opposed to two, which means what?
3730709	3732270	You can plug in four dance pads at once.
3732290	3733930	Which means you don't need a multi-tap.
3734291	3735191	Yeah, you don't need a multi-tap.
3735211	3736211	To play Bomberman.
3736312	3742654	But no, now you can plug in four dance pads at once, and you can play a brand new mode called Quad Mode.
3743315	3744975	It's going to be in Ultramix 2.
3745015	3746136	For four, wow!
3746696	3748657	It's going to be four, no, it's four pads.
3748737	3751658	It's a whole new set of steps for one person on four pads.
3752479	3753319	It's doubles-doubles.
3754685	3754925	Evil.
3756086	3760128	So you could have arrows that take you all the way from pad number one, way on the left, to pad number four.
3760408	3763810	And a lot of people were talking about, well, what's the configuration going to be?
3763830	3766472	Because if you think about Tetris, you could have four squares a lot of different ways.
3766752	3767992	It's going to be one giant line.
3769173	3771734	I'd have to say that I copyrighted this about two years ago.
3771955	3773455	They will be hearing from my lawyers.
3774316	3778958	Okay, because I was making edits for two machines to use all four panels.
3779539	3781600	Two different sets of edits to play one song.
3782304	3783605	That was my quad mode.
3783985	3785686	God damn it, they stole it from me.
3788127	3790548	I actually remember doing something like this.
3790608	3796190	Like, I remember one time at Arcade Infinity starting two machines at the same time to do some kind of, like, quad thing.
3796671	3800312	But I don't even... I don't remember what the joke was, but there was something we were trying to do.
3800632	3801833	But yeah, but you know what?
3802948	3806012	What does it seem like is happening with this mix, though, with the song list?
3806632	3816103	It looks like they're listing their fanbase a little more, so I wouldn't be surprised if they did look out there and see that maybe there are people, crazy as they might be, that want this quad mode in DDR.
3816143	3821890	Now, me personally, I'm kind of like, well, I think it's a nice idea, like the quad mode, I think it's kind of cute, but...
3822868	3824230	Who's going to have four dance pads?
3824290	3825531	It's innovative, I'll say that.
3825932	3828334	But then, okay, here's the argument to that.
3828815	3832699	Quad mode is only going to be available in something called the party mode on Ultramix 2.
3832920	3835122	So it's obviously set up for DDR parties.
3835222	3836504	I mean, as cheesy as that might sound.
3836824	3839327	Where your friends bring their dance pads over to your house.
3840348	3843612	Or maybe it's going to be something cool like two people can play doubles.
3844795	3846035	They have doubles versus, aren't they?
3846796	3847096	That's right.
3847116	3848556	No, I think they said it was going to be a full four.
3848576	3849657	Beginner, light, standard, and heavy.
3849777	3853718	I'd have to re-look through, but I'm almost positive they said it was going to be a full new set.
3853778	3854278	We'll see.
3854298	3854338	So...
3875356	3875636	You know what?
3875656	3876857	That's going to be very interesting, huh?
3877077	3885780	I want them to do another Best Hits on Xbox and bring out the individual mixes on one DVD.
3886981	3887741	Guild Arcade mixes.
3887761	3889822	Yeah, I mean, but remember, U.S.
3889862	3897165	isn't Japan, so unless they put it out for Japanese Xbox, which, you know, but they'll never do it because Xbox wasn't really popular over there.
3897545	3898425	It's selling stuff.
3898785	3899926	Yeah, but not quite.
3901069	3908732	I still think that it would be neat so that I can, you know, not have to break out my Dreamcast every time I want to play Second Mix.
3909952	3912313	Well, they do have Second Mix on PlayStation.
3912593	3914574	You can go to that bowling alley in Auburn.
3914734	3916555	There you go.
3916615	3917275	Let's see, what else?
3918383	3940764	multiple players on this is another interesting thing about Ultramix 2 now you can have multiple players on one Xbox going on Xbox Live to play so now you don't have to be you have to stay home it's kind of going more into the multiplayer and party functions where you can have multiple people over the song list will contain 70 songs not including the song packs which means that
3942583	3950406	If you buy your song packs from Service Pack 1 through 6 for Ultramix 1, you can use these on Ultramix 2.
3951166	3952167	So, think about this.
3952367	3954688	That's 30 songs between Service Packs 1 through 6, right?
3954708	3957129	And who speculated this while somebody was out of town?
3959570	3960510	I do believe I did.
3960690	3961431	Yeah, yeah.
3962071	3962411	Wow.
3962511	3962911	There you go.
3963331	3968233	But that's going to be 100 songs playable in Ultramix from the start.
3969554	3969654	Crazy.
3969674	3969994	Crazy.
3971164	3972685	Thank you, Konami.
3972705	3973165	We love you.
3973485	3977127	And there's going to be inside that 14 Konami original DDR songs.
3977167	3978368	So we kind of saw some of those.
3979228	3980249	Star Mine and all that stuff.
3981229	3982570	So that's going to be very interesting.
3983330	3984091	Very, very interesting.
3984571	3988233	But they are going to have this downloadable edits thing, which I'm kind of curious how that's going to work.
3988273	3994056	If anybody can submit edits, or if they're going to have some kind of screening process where they only take good edits or what they're going to do.
3994076	3995196	It'll be very interesting.
3995576	3998138	Oh, and Panda, I do believe the Xbox is region coded.
3998938	3999138	Is it?
3999598	4000379	Yes, I do believe it is.
4000539	4000659	Hmm.
4002799	4003479	Very interesting.
4005501	4007162	I'm kind of excited to see this mix now.
4008142	4013585	I know it's been difficult in the past to get excited about anything Xbox, but boy, they're really doing DDR right on there, I say.
4015566	4016367	I'm looking forward to it.
4017087	4017707	How about you, Jamie?
4017928	4019829	What do you think about this Ultramix 2 so far?
4019869	4020409	This is just so far.
4020429	4021049	I'm going to get it.
4021229	4022970	We still haven't heard everything about it yet.
4023091	4023271	What?
4023591	4024191	I'm going to get it.
4024271	4026212	You know I'll have it, even if I play it or not.
4026933	4028313	I have Ultramix 1.
4028414	4029954	You know, my Ultramix 1 is unopened.
4029974	4030675	Really?
4030695	4030935	Really.
4031385	4036447	It is because I never had time, because by the time I got around to playing it, I was doing other things.
4036587	4037387	Well, at least you bought it.
4037707	4038708	Well, yeah, I have it.
4038728	4039908	I have the dance pad and everything.
4040168	4043809	But it'll give me a good excuse to break it out and start downloading the songpacks.
4043849	4044250	There you go.
4047311	4047631	Alright.
4048051	4052292	What about you guys here that don't have an Xbox yet, like DDR Angel and Arcadian?
4052312	4052713	What do you think?
4052773	4058855	Is this kind of making you go, oh boy, I might have to get an Xbox, or what do you think?
4058995	4059635	Not really.
4060816	4061596	I'm afraid that...
4081903	4085224	If I ever decided to get one, Magus would kill me.
4086385	4088085	He just has this thing against Xbox, I guess.
4088105	4088766	But it's DDR.
4088806	4089546	He'll get over it.
4089686	4091927	Yeah, he should get over it because he's a Halo addict.
4092407	4093087	There you go.
4093147	4094328	So you can play Halo on it, too.
4094388	4095088	Okay, you know what?
4095308	4098309	I want to know how his opinion should affect you buying something you want.
4098809	4099950	Ooh, slam.
4101831	4103591	I guess he'd get over it.
4104632	4105572	So maybe I will.
4106272	4106612	I don't know.
4107653	4108833	Damn straight he'll get over it.
4108873	4110654	If you want an Xbox, you should get an Xbox.
4111513	4112293	So they just have to live.
4112513	4114134	Interesting comment from the chat room.
4114154	4121036	I'm not sure if I'm reading too far into this, but truthfully, it's going to be only those that don't know about the Sims that will get the Xbox, says John Fields.
4121316	4123737	The others will download the steps as they have for every mix.
4124417	4125958	But again, I go back to what I said earlier.
4126018	4127018	Stepmania is not DDR.
4129179	4129599	It's not.
4129959	4133340	And I don't think that Stepmania is going to have... Xbox Live.
4133680	4134800	It doesn't have Xbox Live.
4136321	4138281	It does not have Xbox Live.
4138301	4139602	Okay, but they're...
4140580	4143622	Dude, they're saying rumor is that they're going to have an internet thing, whatever.
4144263	4145904	Eh.
4145924	4146965	They have Step Mania online already.
4147985	4149146	Do they have Step Mania online already?
4149426	4150447	How come I've never seen you play it?
4151288	4152689	Because I just don't care.
4153329	4154970	No, but they already have Step Mania online.
4158133	4160834	Well, I don't know, I'm still... I couldn't get that stupid thing to work.
4160854	4163757	Because they're still working on it.
4164537	4166839	I just, I think the percentage... But Xbox Live is already up.
4167659	4168500	I think the percentage...
4170577	4171307	X-Lax Live
4173119	4179203	I just think it's such a small percentage of people that would opt out of Ultramix 2 for Step Mania.
4179223	4181824	I think that's why Konami hasn't sued the pants off of Step Mania yet.
4181885	4186207	It's because it's going to be such a small percentage of people that it's really negligent.
4186487	4192851	Remember, the DDR community that you see online and in chat rooms and stuff is not the scope of the DDR community as a whole.
4192991	4200296	And there's going to be people who go, Oh, look, it's another game for the Xbox that's going to get my couch potato kid off of his ass.
4201601	4209302	I've talked to plenty of parents who go into GameStop and say, oh, well, this is going to keep my kid from being lazy.
4210285	4214887	All right, I'm actually going to open up the Skype line because I'm curious what some folks out there think about Ultramix 2.
4215727	4219609	I especially like to hear from people who are contemplating buying an Xbox over this whole thing.
4220450	4221530	So we'll open up that Skype line.
4221550	4227913	If you want to call us, we have some information on our website, but just go to Skype.org and download the client there.
4227953	4228873	It's a free client.
4228893	4229774	It's a free program.
4229834	4238878	All you have to have, you have to have a broadband connection and a microphone and just add Orange Lounge Radio, all one word, to your contact list and you will be able to call us.
4239278	4239378	Hello?
4239398	4239498	Hello?
4239518	4239758	Who is this?
4257509	4258450	and Unknown Gamer.
4281734	4282195	It's okay.
4282655	4283255	It's okay?
4283755	4284096	Yeah.
4284736	4288197	Was there any songs that you're getting really excited about that you're going to be able to play?
4289118	4290498	Moonlight fucking Shadow.
4290739	4292719	Moonlight fucking Shadow is the word.
4292759	4297181	Hey, unknown gamer, if you can, turn up your mic volume on your end a little bit so we can hear you a little better.
4299122	4300903	But he says Moonlight fucking Shadow.
4300943	4301823	Why Moonlight Shadow?
4303384	4305085	Because I'm fucking obsessed with erotics.
4305740	4307221	Because he's obsessed with erotic.
4308221	4308901	Uh-huh.
4309181	4309802	I see how it is.
4309862	4310142	Okay.
4310182	4311422	Are you like stalker obsessed?
4312022	4312923	Yeah.
4313363	4314243	Ooh.
4314643	4315024	Hot.
4315404	4315844	Very hot.
4316144	4316744	That hot.
4317505	4319045	Do you already have an Xbox?
4319845	4320346	No, I do not.
4320726	4321106	No, you do not.
4321146	4322186	Are you thinking about getting one?
4322867	4323427	Yes, I am.
4323527	4324447	That is obsession.
4325288	4326368	Just because of Moonlight Shadow?
4327488	4327748	Yeah.
4328949	4329969	Now that is an obsession.
4330269	4331270	That is definitely an obsession.
4331310	4333231	You could get one of the nifty green Halo ones.
4333831	4334351	That's what I bought.
4336199	4337560	Be like us, have a green one.
4337580	4339760	They don't make them in hot pink erotic flavor yet.
4340680	4341180	Maybe soon.
4341861	4344621	Okay, I don't think that erotic flavor would be hot pink.
4344661	4346362	I think it would be like blood red or something.
4346382	4346902	It would be sex.
4347422	4349182	It would be, yeah, it would be nookie colored.
4349923	4350663	It would be like purple.
4351383	4355944	We have to clarify something for folks in our chat room because people are going, wait a minute, Moonlight Shadow is an erotic song?
4356984	4359405	Actually, do you want to explain this one, Unknown Gamer, or do you want me to?
4360455	4363577	Do you want me to explain it with the way my microphone sounds right now?
4363758	4364398	Okay, yeah, you're right.
4364438	4365159	I better explain it.
4367240	4376868	The reason why Moonlight Shadow is tied to Erotic is that actually the old lead singer from Erotic went and she joined this new band called Missing Heart.
4377268	4379290	She kind of went off on her own and did this Missing Heart.
4379550	4385335	So that's why it gets tied back to Erotic a lot because it's the same vocalist that you hear in a lot of the old Erotic songs.
4385755	4389498	So that's why Moonlight Shadow kind of has ties to Erotic.
4390771	4395033	But the only difference is that she's not going, Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
4398535	4398895	Rob.
4399596	4399816	What?
4400076	4400316	Rob.
4401116	4402237	Never do that again, please.
4402597	4402997	Oh, okay.
4403338	4403658	I'll try.
4406379	4408260	Maybe I screwed that up.
4408540	4409861	Lunarius is correcting me in the chat room.
4409881	4414803	He says it was originally sung by the vocalist for Erotic and then redone by the Missing Hearts singer.
4415263	4416204	So maybe I fucked that up.
4416264	4416544	I don't know.
4419870	4423072	I'm going to type to you the story of what happened and then you just tell people what happened.
4440437	4441077	You have dessert.
4441257	4441957	I need dessert.
4442297	4443098	I want dessert.
4443118	4443998	I already ate it.
4444158	4447259	I have some Diverse System 7 tracks I would like to play.
4448539	4448719	What?
4448979	4451859	No, wait, we have to wait for those, because we're getting another call real fast.
4451919	4452980	No, I'm going to take this call.
4453460	4454740	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4457041	4457381	Hello.
4457801	4458501	Hello.
4458661	4460081	He wants Diverse System 7 tracks.
4460741	4462102	He does not want dessert.
4462282	4463222	We cannot hear you.
4463342	4463782	Please speak up.
4466555	4467115	Aw, bummer.
4467515	4469916	Uh, call us back when you get your mic thing rearranged.
4469956	4470116	Yeah.
4470676	4470936	Alright.
4471456	4471876	That's too bad.
4471996	4472597	Okay, hold on.
4472617	4474557	I'm getting the story with Moonlight Shadow here.
4477058	4477638	Oh, I thought I was.
4480018	4480578	Alright, we'll get that.
4480618	4481139	Alright, fine.
4481179	4484119	Go to the Diverse 7 stuff and then... Yes, you do.
4484279	4487500	Play the Diverse 7 stuff and then we'll come back to the story of Moonlight Shadow.
4489901	4491541	We'll open up the Skype line again later, guys.
4498956	4499596	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4568340	4569381	Thanks for watching!
4583533	4584714	Oops, got to take that off there.
4585254	4595378	Anyways, the next one, real quick, is a Trip Machine Dark Core mix, and my god, I have to say, this is, for Trip Machine, what P8107 was for Paranoia.
4595778	4599040	So, it's going to be fucking awesome, that's all I've got to say.
4602881	4599040	... ... ...
4616764	4618025	Thanks for watching!
4643587	4644689	Thank you for watching!
4663442	4668085	Okay, and then one that's really cool, I don't really know what exactly this is.
4668385	4671587	It says it's Reality Alpha 0.2 mix.
4671747	4679472	It sounds like what it is is just a bunch of different songs kind of mixed in the one, which is still kind of cool, but it's pretty hardcore, so check it out.
4747088	4748969	Okay, so that was a few of those.
4749709	4757473	So if they want to order this album of all these Bomani remixes, although we'll be playing them on Diversions Monday night, where can they go to order the CD?
4758093	4764516	Well, Diverse Systems, that's www.diverse.jp, I don't think they're up for sale yet.
4764696	4772280	I think, usually they have their own English page, which, you know, they sell most of their CDs, but it's not on there yet.
4772620	4772900	So...
4773863	4778124	I remember before, they did wait a little bit before they were available for the U.S.
4778544	4788946	I don't know, you know, whether they're getting, you know, taking care of the Japanese first or whatnot, but, um, there's, I don't know when exactly these are going to be up right now.
4788966	4792147	I was checking, um, right now, you can purchase them.
4792207	4802889	They have a few links on, um, the right-hand side where you can purchase them from, um, and I don't know why they're selling them there, uh, Dojinci sites, um, so you can get those there, but, um,
4803926	4807447	Right now available from their site, they don't have them yet.
4808167	4812188	So, I'm looking to see right now if it's on their ordering page.
4814028	4818889	No, actually it is on their Japanese ordering page, but not on their English ordering page.
4819109	4825531	You might be able to, I don't know, you might be able to send them an email or something if you can speak Japanese, but...
4827210	4830672	Right now, yeah, and it's going to be three different CDs.
4830712	4831753	They're all pressed CDs.
4831893	4833874	They're going to be about $15 a piece.
4834955	4839117	That's D7 5 keys, D7 7 keys, and D7 Other Mixture.
4840338	4844721	So definitely look for those, and I will be getting those as soon as I can order them.
4846840	4851803	Alright, I was going to open the Skype line back up because our caller wanted to call back because he had something he wanted to share with us.
4851863	4853924	So we're going to open back up that Skype line there.
4854004	4856246	So you can call us if you want.
4857126	4858487	Skype.org to download the client.
4858867	4864191	And pretty soon we're going to be going to break here and in the break we'll be hearing some songs that are going to be in Ultramix 2.
4864531	4866112	Some of those port overs from 2DX.
4866512	4869554	So those of you guys that haven't heard the songs yet can have a chance to hear them.
4870094	4872196	Because, you know, we want you to be able to hear the songs.
4873316	4874357	Alright, let's take this call.
4875410	4877132	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4877632	4878533	Hello there, Rob.
4878573	4879274	Hello, everybody.
4879534	4880075	Hello.
4880195	4882718	This is Mr. VXJasonXV, is it not?
4883338	4884159	You would be correct.
4884259	4885240	How are you doing, sir?
4885901	4886782	I'm doing pretty good.
4887142	4887463	All right.
4887523	4889465	What do you want to talk to us with about Ultramix 2?
4890246	4893209	I basically wanted to add in something about how the songpacks are going to work.
4894210	4897974	For all of you that have Ultramix already and have gotten the songpacks and didn't know this,
4898720	4905365	Basically what's going to happen is if you have the songpacks purchased and downloaded, when you fire up Ultramix 2, it's just going to work.
4905545	4908788	They're going to be on the list, you're going to play them, it's going to be beautiful.
4909208	4913031	The only catch is the songpacks... What was that?
4913231	4914072	It's plug and play.
4914612	4916033	It is plug and play.
4917695	4920177	What's going to happen though is that the videos are going to be different.
4920377	4923219	Because, you know, obviously Ultramix is going to cycle video content.
4923743	4931745	But Order of Chaos on DDR Freak said that there's going to be exclusive videos, brand new videos for those songs now on Ultramix 2.
4932285	4932685	Really?
4932985	4940527	So basically the media is going to be already on the DVD, but the steps and actually showing up is going to be off your hard drive for downloading the content.
4940808	4945709	I've heard rumors that there's going to be a lot of new videos in Ultramix 2.
4946932	4947893	That's what they're pushing for.
4947953	4951615	I don't know how much I can say, but I hear that there's a lot of new videos in Ultramix 2.
4952335	4955637	If you're wanting to see some new videos, Ultramix 2 is going to give you plenty.
4957097	4957598	I'm kidding.
4958438	4958858	We'll see.
4960419	4964521	You will still be able to buy the first six song packs on Ultramix 2.
4965222	4970144	The only catch is if you do that, you can only use them for Ultramix 2 and not for the first one.
4970825	4971545	Oh, interesting.
4971645	4974627	So if you're smart, you'll buy your packs on Ultramix 1 now.
4975458	4981563	That is what I want to do, because there's no word yet if the songpacks are going to be removed from purchase for Ultramix 1.
4981863	4984846	I'm hoping not, so I can get them too, but, you know.
4985606	4987528	Do you actually have Ultramix 1 right now?
4987588	4989069	No, I don't even have an Xbox.
4989389	4991431	Is Ultramix 2 making you change your mind here?
4991971	5000318	I've wanted to get one for a while, I've just never really had a good amount of incentive, but this is definitely making me want one even more now.
5000618	5003881	So you're telling me that Jet Set Radio Future was not enough?
5004501	5004782	Okay.
5005638	5006619	I never played the first one.
5006659	5008421	It was in... Halo 2?
5008661	5012724	Well, now that you can get Jet... If you get your Xbox, you should also get Jet Star Radio Future since it's cheap now.
5013185	5013465	Sure.
5013725	5014166	Why not?
5014226	5014946	It's a good game.
5015767	5016408	And the Buffy game.
5017969	5018730	The Buffy game.
5019490	5020711	Okay, Buffy, yeah.
5021092	5022453	Alright, Jason, when you... I wanna look into that.
5022613	5025656	When you get your Xbox, we're gonna have a battle on Xbox Live, alright?
5026176	5026817	Sounds awesome.
5026937	5028078	You're gonna get served!
5028118	5030080	Yeah, I'm gonna serve you on Xbox Live.
5030820	5031321	Oh no!
5031341	5031841	Oh no!
5033468	5035169	I'm actually thinking about this.
5035289	5035609	I don't know.
5035809	5040150	I'm going to kind of put some feelers out in the chat room and kind of see what you guys think about this.
5040510	5044671	What would you guys think about starting up some kind of Sunday night Ultramix League?
5045032	5046032	Like right after the show.
5046432	5048192	We all jump on Xbox Live and play.
5048333	5048813	I would do it.
5049093	5050133	I'll even jump on there and play.
5050773	5052154	Orange Lounge DDR team?
5052474	5056415	Yeah, it'll be like our Sunday night, you know, Ultramix night.
5056475	5057695	Like post-show thing.
5058536	5059876	I don't know how many people would be interested.
5060036	5061897	Or if that's like way too dorky for you guys.
5061957	5062277	I don't know.
5064639	5069820	If it brings people together and gets us some good playtime in, sounds good by me.
5069840	5072161	Because I've actually been on Xbox Live after the show.
5072201	5079963	There's at least one person in our chatroom that sometimes likes to get on there and play different songs after the show sometimes.
5080003	5082564	So I'm thinking, why not expand it and get a lot of people on there?
5082584	5083344	It might be kind of fun.
5083524	5083924	So we'll see.
5084690	5089114	I've heard the people that are getting on live that there's very few people that play on live anymore.
5089274	5092117	Well, anymore, but think about when the first game came out, too.
5092837	5093258	That's true.
5093458	5095540	You know, it's almost a year old now.
5095580	5097582	Of course there's not a lot of people still on Xbox Live.
5097942	5100784	But, hey, that's the thing, is that we want to start something up, too.
5100865	5101425	Let's start it.
5101465	5102706	Let's get Ultramix.
5103347	5105048	It's kind of like an I Love the 90s thing.
5105088	5106670	Remember when the old stuff was cool?
5106790	5108131	Remember when Ultramix was cool?
5108171	5108952	Kind of bringing it back.
5110333	5110874	So let's see.
5112020	5112280	All right.
5112300	5112480	All right.
5135638	5135738	Yeah.
5135778	5136138	Interesting.
5136199	5141182	Somebody should buy me an Xbox and all the songpacks and a live subscription for a few years, because I don't have money yet, and I have bills to pay.
5162445	5164646	Well, I'm sure that's the same boat a lot of folks are in.
5164666	5166427	Maybe they'll drop the price of an Xbox again.
5166527	5167528	Not likely, but you never know.
5167688	5168108	Hopefully.
5168188	5168909	What are they right now?
5168929	5168909	$150?
5169109	5174372	$175?
5169209	5174372	I think $150, but you could get a refurbed one at one of those places for $120, $130.
5174732	5175653	You know what?
5176253	5178114	I'd say version 1s are a lot better anyways.
5178614	5180695	I have the Super Halo ones, so I don't know.
5181776	5183697	You know you can hack them if you have a memory stick.
5184918	5185818	Yep, I have heard.
5185898	5186859	There's plenty of those.
5186879	5190721	And you have to use the first release of, like, Mecha Assault.
5191178	5192198	Yep.
5192218	5193559	Yeah, a friend of ours can do it.
5194399	5195800	So we're going to test that theory soon.
5197380	5198321	Oh, did someone get married?
5199301	5199581	Alright.
5200702	5201782	Okay, well thanks for calling, Jason.
5202322	5202682	Thank you.
5202722	5203283	You have a good one.
5203323	5204223	Call back anytime.
5204603	5205844	Anytime, my friend, anytime.
5206484	5206704	Bye.
5206804	5207084	Bye.
5207844	5212466	Alright, we'll keep the Skype line open if anybody else has something they want to comment on with Ultramix 2.
5215247	5217808	I'm serious about this Xbox Live thing after the show.
5217848	5218568	I think it would be fun.
5218829	5219609	Would you guys play?
5221440	5223901	I'm making pouty faces and blinking my eyelashes.
5224681	5225241	On Sunday?
5225601	5226401	Now, wait a minute, Loki.
5226621	5232363	With Ultramix 2, multiple people can play from one Xbox, so you and I can both play on the Ultramix.
5232663	5233743	Wow, really?
5234183	5236104	Yeah, don't say... Don't care.
5237604	5238864	I'll play Final Fantasy XI.
5240305	5240665	Jerk.
5241045	5241365	Jerk.
5241805	5242245	Yes, Angel.
5242345	5245506	Screw it, I'm gonna twist Magus' arm and make him buy me an Xbox.
5245526	5249527	But don't worry, those demons that come through my demonic vortex can play with you.
5251815	5252215	Wonderful.
5253596	5256417	Now some folks in the chat room are saying we should do it before the show.
5257217	5259638	After the show would be too late, because honestly, I'm driving home.
5259838	5260278	Yeah.
5260678	5263759	And I also work an earlier schedule now.
5263779	5267020	I have to get up at 5.30 in the morning to go to work.
5267180	5268640	Well, I'll have to think.
5268860	5269221	I don't know.
5269241	5269681	We'll see.
5269701	5270961	Because my ass is going to school.
5270981	5274702	At the same time, for me personally, I have to get my Sunday stuff done before the show.
5274762	5275423	So, I don't know.
5275443	5275803	We'll see.
5276363	5277483	We'll butt heads on it.
5277503	5278504	Well, how about a different night?
5279084	5279664	That might work, too.
5280649	5288076	Yeah, we'll see what we can do.
5288116	5290558	If there's an interest for doing something like that, we'll set something up.
5290798	5291139	We'll see.
5291779	5297144	Yeah, as soon as I tell Magus what songs are on the new Ultramix 2, he'll probably get one.
5297546	5297786	Maybe.
5298167	5303733	We're not even... We haven't even really... We've only heard, like, one new licensed song, Brick House, by Commodores.
5304013	5308799	We haven't even heard about any of the other stuff, and there might be some really good stuff that's going to tell us next time.
5308819	5310841	Shit, I would just play it for the Commodores song.
5311562	5315487	That's an inside joke between Pixie Dust and I, so, yeah.
5315667	5316087	We'll see.
5317168	5317529	We'll see.
5318110	5318410	All right.
5319288	5325272	What we're going to do now, actually, I think we'll go ahead and take a break, and we're going to play those songs from Ultramix 2 that are being ported over from 2DX.
5325332	5330135	So in this break, you're going to hear Route 80s, Star Mine, and VJ Army.
5330715	5332416	So we'll be back right after this.
5332576	5334638	You are tuned in to Orange Lounge Radio.
5335038	5337299	After the break, we might get into the cage match, I think.
5337339	5338540	We need to do that at some point.
5339040	5342242	And so much more, as soon as we can think of it.
5342422	5343503	All right, we'll be back.
5353840	5355022	Thanks for watching!
5370089	5371070	Why isn't the movie on?
5371170	5371930	You have the time!
5372550	5374871	Why isn't the movie on?
5374891	5375712	You have the time!
5402281	5402942	Thanks for watching!
5433211	5435012	What is a movie and you understand?
5557350	5558151	Thanks for watching!
5620963	5621810	Thank you for watching!
5658419	5659919	Hey, did you hear about that show?
5660399	5660980	What show?
5661280	5666761	Well, they play a lot of great Fermanian video game music, but if you listen to it, you have to listen to it again within seven days.
5667161	5668441	Oh, I've heard of that station.
5668521	5668881	Really?
5669281	5671382	Yeah, I even listened to it a couple weeks ago.
5671862	5674142	Hey, what happens to you if you don't listen to it again?
5674342	5675302	Well, you die.
5675903	5676463	I, what?
5677283	5681464	Hey, wait, what's this crazy bitch doing coming out of my computer screen?
5681484	5681744	Ahhhh!
5683707	5684828	Orange Lounge Radio.
5684988	5686228	Listen or die!
5697433	5697553	D.D.R.
5697653	5697934	Extreme
5722854	5727497	There's actually some brand new eye toy modes in DDR, and it's very interesting.
5728137	5730479	We have the Clean the Screen, of course, which is nothing new.
5730539	5733640	That was in the E3 demo, you remember that?
5734241	5739604	But then there's one called Coconut Panic, which, by the way, has nothing to do with DDR at all.
5741570	5742771	Which I thought was very interesting.
5742831	5744791	It's just all these coconuts falling in, you know.
5745752	5747533	And we have to clean the screen.
5747893	5751334	I'm trying to look at some of these screenshots, which we linked from OrangeloungeRadio.com.
5751354	5753936	Cleaning the screen was neat, but it'd be kind of annoying to play, I think.
5754876	5760699	You know what I think is cool, though, is that for working out purposes, the eye toy thing is cool.
5760999	5761139	Oh, yeah.
5761159	5764480	Like, that's the only reason I would use it, is that... Hands and feet mode, too.
5764620	5765021	Oh, yeah.
5765601	5765881	Oh, yeah.
5767568	5773712	Um, and then they have that Feed the Animals game, which I haven't really seen a whole lot about, but it looks very interesting, that's for sure.
5775173	5779735	That's the one where you're gonna step on the different food, and you feed it to the animal that's on the screen.
5780656	5781216	It's crazy.
5783035	5783575	Very crazy.
5784355	5787056	Can I find some more information about some of these modes?
5787556	5788096	What else do we have?
5788136	5794178	We have the Hyper Dash, which looks like the old school track and field, which I have no idea how that's going to work with the Eye Toy.
5794498	5803020	I think it might actually just be using the dance pad where you're just going to run in place like all, every single old school Nintendo Power Pad game was just like running in place as fast as you can.
5803520	5804641	And that was your workout, remember?
5808062	5808522	And then they have...
5810754	5812875	Dance Aerobics was a little different.
5813155	5814716	It was cool 8-bit sounds and stuff.
5815136	5818318	Then they have this one called Magical Ball.
5819218	5824501	This new iToy game, Magical Ball, which, again, doesn't appear to have anything to do with DDR.
5824661	5828743	It just is like Breakout, you know, the old school game Breakout or Arachnoid.
5829243	5830423	But now it's Arachnoid, whatever.
5830784	5835186	But you use your hands as a paddle, which I think is very interesting.
5835686	5836706	Magical Ball.
5838187	5840068	You can show Konami your Magical Balls.
5843433	5843573	V-Rare
5873052	5874173	Everybody looks so enthused.
5874713	5875793	I'll have to order it.
5876574	5878895	Oh, then again, my man does manage a webcam.
5879595	5879875	A webcam.
5879895	5880756	I'm going to say webcam.
5881096	5883097	What kind of business is your man in?
5883497	5886759	Look, I was typing webcam on the thing.
5886819	5887779	It's GameStop.
5888040	5888560	Oh, okay.
5889020	5889420	You sure?
5889901	5890821	Yes.
5891441	5891721	Rob.
5892442	5892662	What?
5892782	5893022	Rob.
5893102	5894043	What?
5894303	5894523	Rob.
5894563	5894703	What?
5895704	5895984	Bite me.
5896324	5897244	Okay.
5900226	5900546	All right.
5903942	5911284	Well, I guess if no one has anything else to say on the DDR Extreme, why don't we just go ahead and have ourselves a cage match?
5911324	5911964	How's that sound?
5913984	5914325	Sure.
5914645	5915385	All right, we'll do it.
5915985	5917025	I got to be lazy today.
5917045	5918766	What do you mean you got to be lazy today?
5919126	5920306	I didn't have to bring one.
5920946	5922727	That's right, because you won last week, didn't you?
5922907	5923407	Uh-huh.
5923687	5924167	That's right.
5924387	5924807	Finally.
5925367	5928788	All right, so just as a reminder, the way the cage match works,
5929656	5934039	You have to be in our chat room at www.orangeloundtrader.com Click on chat.
5934059	5936000	We're going to play three songs for you guys.
5936501	5941484	A clip of last week's winner because, you know, you were listening last week so you've already heard it.
5941905	5943326	So we're only going to play a clip of it.
5943946	5947428	And then we'll hear two new songs brought to the table from each host.
5947789	5949350	And you will vote on your favorite.
5950367	5961892	and the winner goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's, I'm sorry, Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani Music & More program, which plays on this station 24 hours a day, 7 days a week when we aren't live.
5962852	5964993	Alright, so here we go.
5965113	5971856	Last week's winner was Jamie and she brought to the table a song by Mflow, which you know from old school DDR games and 2DX.
5972423	5974264	So this is their new album.
5974685	5978087	From their new album, it's a song called Astro Sexy Chemistry.
5978407	5979388	And it's last week's winner.
5979768	5980869	And so here's a clip of it.
5981129	5983291	So you can decide if you want it to win again tonight.
5983351	5985332	Song number one, M-Flow, Astro Sexy.
5985553	5987534	Astro Sexy Chemistry
6009495	6010756	Thanks for watching!
6094115	6094896	Thank you for watching!
6128038	6130861	All right, that was a clip of song number one in tonight's cage match.
6130881	6132542	M-Flow with Astro Sexy.
6152423	6157768	Alright, the next pick in tonight's cage match, the first challenger comes from our very own Loki.
6157828	6159709	Loki, what did you pick for tonight's cage match?
6161451	6163373	I picked a song, but I don't know what it's from.
6163553	6167937	It's... They said it was from Outphase.
6168557	6171280	I don't think it's from Outphase, but it's called Nuance.
6174284	6181670	So this is one of those songs where somebody has decided they are going to say it's from Outphase even though they have no particular proof of this, right?
6182991	6183571	Exactly.
6183951	6185973	But you liked it anyway, so you're putting it in a cage match.
6186794	6187694	That and I just don't care.
6188295	6188615	All right.
6189264	6206672	Fair enough, so here it is, an unknown group that we're going to call, not Outphase, Inphase, maybe somebody will recognize us and help us out, who knows, and the song is called Nuon, and this is Loki's pick in tonight's cage match, enjoy.
6224122	6224923	Thanks for watching!
6364972	6365773	Thanks for watching!
6408056	6409117	Thanks for watching!
6461640	6463981	All right, that was song number two in tonight's cage match.
6464081	6468142	A group that they are saying is out-phased, but we're kind of skeptical at this point.
6468602	6472223	But Nuon is the song, and Loki liked it so much he put it in tonight's cage match.
6472283	6473463	What did the rest of us think?
6473563	6473903	Jamie?
6473963	6475483	That doesn't sound like any out-phase to me.
6475824	6478124	I did not detect the presence of Taku in that.
6479864	6480805	And I would know!
6481405	6484105	Because, see, some people have various types of radar.
6484686	6485386	I have Takudar.
6487443	6488244	And it didn't go off.
6489064	6489885	It didn't even blink.
6491145	6495408	So, it sounds pretty generic-y trance, honestly, to me.
6495888	6497870	So it gets the 7 for being average.
6498610	6500992	Alright, 7 for being average from Jamie.
6501012	6502973	DDR Angel, what did you think of Nuance?
6504594	6505415	I thought it was pretty good.
6505475	6511620	I mean, pretty good for like background music if you need to do your homework or something.
6512121	6515404	You know, if you're just playing around, photo editing or whatever.
6515424	6519427	I'd probably say an 8.5.
6520788	6521249	Arcadian 42.
6521549	6526473	Yeah, I'll say it sounded way too generic for me.
6526834	6527635	It wasn't too bad.
6527695	6528475	I'll give it a 7.5.
6529256	6530037	Alright, Loki.
6530957	6531538	I'll give it an 8.
6532697	6538526	All right, and my thought is if that is out phase, it's very generic and very sad direction for them.
6538606	6542552	So I remain highly skeptical as to that being out phase.
6542933	6545437	It's a little generic, but it's not bad.
6545990	6547711	I've just heard Better Trance, so I give it a 7.
6548752	6564205	Alright, but our opinions don't count, it's you in the chatroom that has the final say, and now you get my pick in tonight's page match, and I am being very adventurous tonight, because I haven't even completely heard the song I'm putting in, ever.
6564725	6573773	I heard it at the club the other night, and then I downloaded it, and now I'm putting it in, and I have no idea if I even like this song as much as I thought I did,
6574153	6575715	Hold me my sweet, hold me now, hold me God
6624468	6625389	and many more.
6681528	6682249	Thanks for watching!
6728524	6729645	Thanks for watching!
6770896	6772418	Power of New Life Sweets
6807079	6809339	Alright, that was song number three in tonight's Cage Match.
6809379	6810480	A song I've never heard before.
6810560	6813581	Royal Gigolos with California Dreamin'.
6813601	6813941	Jamie.
6815601	6816122	You know what?
6817982	6825385	That was really... And I understand you... Had you heard it through all the way, I'm sure you would have reconsidered your choice.
6825485	6825765	Yeah.
6827252	6827592	You know what?
6827612	6829953	The mix I heard was actually a little different.
6830033	6834415	That one was more repetitive than our... I remember it being, like, trancier, actually.
6834455	6836856	I was kind of getting into it at first, because I was like, hey, this is kind of cool.
6837057	6838517	And then it was like, eh.
6839498	6843419	And then the bitches singing, because I don't think it was a sample of the Mamas and the Poppers.
6843439	6844560	I don't think it was either.
6844580	6845460	In the video, it wasn't.
6845720	6852243	If you're going to be a professional singer, a requirement is that you hold a key.
6854584	6856225	However, there's Politary...
6857822	6865645	However, where I would normally have given that a 4, because of the name of the band, I said I'd give them a bonus point so they get a 5.
6866145	6866505	Alright.
6867926	6868806	DDR Angel.
6869246	6869606	You know what?
6869686	6876809	I've actually heard better keys held by band newbies.
6878150	6878910	By band newbies.
6879470	6886853	And if you've never been in a saxophone class with 6th graders who have never played a saxophone before, it sounds like cows being beaten to death.
6888015	6889276	Alright, DDR Angel.
6890057	6890477	Moo.
6890697	6891018	Okay.
6891038	6897823	Um, gee, I don't know.
6898463	6901406	Uh, the song was okay.
6901426	6904328	I mean, it was kind of dancey, it was kind of cool, so.
6905689	6907230	And maybe I'll be generous and give it an 8.
6907971	6910993	Alright, a pity point from, uh, DDR Angel.
6911053	6911554	Arcadian.
6913075	6914296	Yeah, it was alright.
6914396	6915837	Okay, nothing special.
6916138	6916338	Uh, 6.
6917307	6918108	Alright, Loki.
6919349	6925295	If I'm going to follow the same guidelines that, you know, DarkSakura gives the song, I'm going to have to give it a 1.
6928601	6932904	To quote Muffin Juice, it sounds more like an elephant getting a pineapple shoved up its ass.
6932924	6933645	Alright, you guys are mean.
6933665	6934065	That would be...
6956401	6956801	All right.
6956861	6957421	Well, let's see.
6957441	6957902	You know what?
6957922	6960482	The chat room may have felt a little differently than the rest of you, right?
6960502	6961343	I have no way to imitate that.
6961443	6964744	And it is up to them to choose between these three songs.
6964864	6967064	Song number one, M-Flow, Astro Sexy.
6968065	6970806	Song number two, Not Out Phase with Nuon.
6970826	6972046	That's a horrible clip.
6972086	6973066	Let's try again.
6992438	6996063	Alright, and song number three, Royal Gigolo's California Dreamin'.
7008983	7012346	Alright, place vote now.
7012966	7016569	Send a private message to Sky in the chatroom with your vote.
7016629	7019652	Remember, you must send it over private message.
7020032	7027919	If you yell it out in the main chatroom, you will not only not have your vote counted, but you will be mocked openly for not listening to the directions.
7028959	7029580	Bye, Jamie.
7030961	7034524	Alright, so... What else am I here for but public mockery?
7036869	7040733	If caning were to be brought back, somehow I imagine you would be involved.
7040773	7041934	You would be the administrator.
7042134	7043395	Dude, that'd be cool.
7045337	7048440	You know what I still think my opinion is to solve all the world's problems?
7048701	7048921	What?
7049301	7049962	Two methods.
7050342	7052764	Standardized test and battle royale.
7053105	7053445	Alright.
7054006	7056348	I seriously think they should take all the inmates, put them on nylons,
7057536	7059697	They made a movie out of that with Ray Liotta.
7059717	7060837	It was called No Escape.
7061137	7069220	But they need to, when they have one left, and he thinks he's a winner and going back to become a productive member of society, then they sink his boat.
7071461	7072122	You guys are horrible.
7073722	7074742	New reality TV.
7075443	7076363	You guys are horrible.
7077844	7078144	Alright.
7080184	7084246	We're going to take a break pretty soon here while we tally up those cage match votes, and when we
7085424	7086225	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7105521	7110408	And this is where we determine on this show the definitive top three of something.
7110648	7112431	You know, because top shows are very popular.
7112671	7120081	Like we have the top ten games and top ten... So we here on Orange Lounge Radio are going to come up with our very own top three.
7120121	7121023	And tonight's topic...
7121583	7125366	is I toy game I would most like to see on DDR.
7125807	7129230	So some of you guys may have a suggestion out there in the chat room.
7129270	7130951	So you might want to type those out because you never know.
7131452	7135095	One of the hosts or the guests might pick that up and use it as their suggestion.
7135155	7136256	So we shall see.
7138021	7138622	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7156900	7161101	Xbox is going to have a brand new Sonic Mega Collection coming out for it.
7161422	7162382	That's going to be pretty cool.
7162822	7165963	20 different games, one Xbox, including Sonic.
7166323	7167723	It has a nice game in it.
7167783	7175046	Sonic Knuckles, Sonic 3D Blast, Sonic and Knuckles, when you put them together, is going to be on there, and a bunch of Game Gear titles.
7175366	7181308	And then these other titles that seemingly have nothing to do with Sonic, The Ooze, Comic Zone, Flicky, and Ristar.
7181788	7184909	You will notice, however, that Sonic CD is not on it.
7185309	7185909	You know what?
7186559	7187720	We need Sonic CD.
7188301	7189702	Maybe it's an unlock, you never know.
7190563	7193025	We need the Japanese version of Sonic CD that has better music.
7193225	7193725	You never know.
7193825	7194446	We need Nights.
7194706	7195587	We need a new Nights game.
7195947	7196428	We will see.
7196448	7197108	Real quick.
7200874	7206000	Rumor is that we'll get our first glimpse of Metal Gear Solid 3 Snake Eater this October.
7206301	7208864	It's going to be launched in Japan this October is the current rumor.
7209224	7211067	We'll confirm that for you as soon as we find out.
7211908	7218636	Coming out on the Game Boy Advance, you know those Nintendo games that you're paying 20 bucks for to play the same damn game you played 15 years ago?
7219557	7221078	There's even more coming out this time.
7221178	7228544	Dr. Mario, Metroid, which seems completely pointless to me because if you want to play the old Metroid, fucking buy Metroid Zero.
7228824	7234049	Because not only will you get the old Metroid, but you'll get a fucking awesome Metroid game with it based off the old Metroid.
7234685	7236687	And wasn't there a way you could bring out the Guardian Legend?
7236907	7244332	Wasn't there a way you could supposedly link your Game Boy Advance with, what was it, Metroid Prime?
7244732	7248875	Yes, Prime and Fusion could link together and you could also unlock the original Metroid that way.
7248915	7251858	So this will be the third time we've had the original Metroid available.
7252258	7252738	You know what?
7252838	7253919	In the past few years, yes.
7254399	7255220	Guardian Legend.
7255340	7255820	I know, I know.
7255841	7256141	Guardian Legend.
7256161	7257061	I tried to get people to vote for it.
7258162	7259183	I told them Guardian Legend.
7259203	7260784	Well, there are two more that we're going to get.
7260804	7261124	Castlevania!
7261144	7261765	Castlevania!
7263135	7263956	is coming out.
7264036	7264756	That is cool.
7264776	7265957	That's a must-have.
7266017	7269040	Of course, if you have a PlayStation, you could also just get Castlevania Chronicles.
7270041	7275085	Or you could just fucking get Symphony of the Night and get a really good Castlevania game.
7275665	7277927	I've been playing a lot of Aria of Sorrow recently.
7277947	7281029	Castlevania III was the best of the Nintendo ones, the Japanese one.
7281830	7286414	I haven't been playing a whole lot of new Castlevania games on Game Boy Advance, but I've been playing this Aria of Sorrow a lot.
7286454	7287295	I actually really like it.
7287335	7287775	It's pretty cool.
7289409	7291732	Also, Zelda 2, The Adventure of Link.
7291832	7292994	I think we all knew that was a given.
7293014	7293796	That would make Dan happy.
7293816	7294356	At some point.
7295418	7296560	I could not get into Zelda 2.
7297561	7298623	But he loves that game.
7299104	7299304	Yep.
7300286	7301227	Also another video game.
7301708	7302229	Yes, Loki.
7302967	7303047	Hmm.
7330669	7334790	Which is also tied in with the Final Fantasy 7 thing, so whatever that is.
7335531	7340672	But it was rumored that they were going to be making a spin-off with Vincent being the lead.
7341192	7342793	Now that would just make me so happy.
7343393	7346474	Because Vincent was my favorite character in Final Fantasy 7.
7346994	7354116	Yeah, so... Like, my last party was Yuffie, Vincent, and of course Cloud, because you couldn't go without him.
7355056	7356857	If I could have ditched Cloud, I would have so fast.
7357196	7357676	www.adventchildren.net
7382267	7382987	That is Sid.
7383687	7384688	Whatever, okay?
7385728	7386708	I was looking at Vincent.
7386908	7387448	That's Sid.
7387688	7388049	Shut up.
7388629	7389249	Kiss my ass.
7389649	7394550	Here's another kick-ass one of Sid here hitting God knows what.
7395291	7396031	I know what you could do.
7396051	7402032	Why don't you post this link in our chat room so the chatters can play along and see some of these pictures because they are very nice pictures, I gotta say.
7404433	7404713	Alright.
7410095	7411615	Any other pictures you want to show us in the studio, though?
7415361	7417902	Yeah, there's a really kick-ass one of Vincent!
7419082	7421023	Okay.
7424305	7425205	Now that is my man.
7425625	7426626	See, that's pretty sweet.
7426666	7428767	Then we've got, of course, Return of Red XIII.
7431008	7435890	You know what's funny is that the whole time I ever played Final Fantasy VII, I never got Vincent.
7436470	7437590	UVS, Vincent, no.
7437610	7438471	Go figure.
7438491	7438771	Go figure.
7439798	7443200	Last call for cage match votes in our chat room, FYI.
7443340	7451886	Also in other video gaming news recently, Metroid Prime will be having a GameCube bundle coming out, of course with the release of Metroid Prime 2 on the way.
7452126	7455829	If you're thinking about getting a GameCube, now's a good time because Metroid Prime...
7456289	7461354	will be released with the GameCube, and they'll also have a sneak peek at Metroid Prime 2 Echoes.
7462736	7468722	Also, there's going to be some new games coming out for the Nintendo DS, which sounds kind of cool.
7469482	7470864	Lots of games being announced.
7471064	7472946	I'm going to see what Konami's got planned.
7473266	7477070	Konami is going to be coming out with a Castlevania game, as well as a game called Boktai?
7477170	7477791	I don't know that one.
7478491	7478952	SONIC DS
7498201	7502142	There's going to be a Mega Man Battle Network game from Capcom.
7502962	7505102	Of course, the mandatory Bust a Move title.
7506043	7510323	I know you must hate that name, but that is what they call it here in the U.S., or Puzzle Bobble, if you must.
7512244	7516265	And for you, DDR Angel, Monster Rancher.
7516825	7518285	Oh, I'm sorry, not Monster Rancher.
7518325	7519105	No, I'm sorry, not that one.
7519145	7520065	I was thinking Harvest Moon.
7520325	7521006	There you go.
7521026	7522246	That's what I was thinking of, Harvest Moon.
7522966	7524926	You're a Monster Rancher.
7526187	7527667	Anyway, do you want to know what book that really is?
7527952	7528152	What?
7528512	7533774	It's like a... I want to say it's like a vampire type thing, but like, I don't know, something more cartoony.
7534274	7537195	But it's got some sun sensor thing or whatever on it.
7537455	7538575	Oh, they have that game here.
7539095	7541576	I forget the name of it here, but they do have it here.
7541616	7542616	I thought that was Boktai.
7542636	7543356	Yeah, with the sunlight.
7543416	7544316	Maybe it was called that.
7544336	7544837	Sorry, sorry, I'll move.
7545617	7545977	Oh, okay.
7546117	7546437	All right.
7546757	7547717	I almost bought that.
7548838	7552959	I almost bought that, but I bought Sword of Mana instead, and I wish I'd bought the other game, because I don't like Sword of Mana.
7553139	7554959	So... Oh, well.
7555239	7555780	You live, you learn.
7556980	7557280	All right.
7558024	7559925	That's it for other gaming news tonight.
7560005	7562285	So we're going to wrap up the cage match voting.
7562846	7565346	And you guys want to know who won tonight's cage match?
7566107	7566707	Sure, Rob.
7566907	7567247	All right.
7567347	7573089	By one stinking vote, one vote, we have a new champion.
7573109	7578771	Nuon is tonight's winner by one vote over Astro Sexy.
7579251	7581592	Who says every vote doesn't count, boys and girls?
7583572	7585533	I thought Astro Sexy was guaranteed to win again.
7586733	7593176	Yeah, because the other... You know, if the one person that voted for California Dreamin' would have voted for the other song, it could have been different, but... The one person?
7593196	7595396	The one person that voted for California Dreamin'.
7597057	7597397	Oh, well.
7598458	7604600	Now, I'm not going to say every vote is cast in secret, but if you want to... If you want to out yourself on air, go ahead.
7605480	7605841	All right.
7606101	7607681	I'll just pick another Inflow song next week.
7607941	7609602	There you go.
7609622	7610402	Or better watch it.
7610602	7611643	I'll pick Toxic.
7613030	7614191	I almost put Toxic in tonight.
7614231	7615491	I'll make you guys listen to Britney.
7615932	7617672	You guys are getting Danny Minow again next week.
7617712	7619273	That's all I have to say.
7619373	7620054	Okay, okay.
7620234	7621795	I'm not going to torture you guys that badly.
7621995	7622815	I'll pick some inflow.
7623075	7623395	All right.
7625176	7626577	I think we're going to go to a break.
7627417	7628558	What should we hear in this break?
7628858	7629218	I don't know.
7629398	7631159	Somebody give me an idea for a theme for this break.
7631179	7631359	Taku.
7632200	7632800	Some Taku?
7632940	7633240	All right.
7633701	7634241	Some Tako?
7634841	7635041	No.
7635581	7636382	Play Thrashtrax.
7637242	7637743	Oh, God.
7637983	7638703	Is that Taku?
7639003	7639183	Yeah.
7639383	7639964	Was it really?
7640304	7642425	Thrashtrax and Tetraku.
7642853	7643354	Alright, fine.
7644776	7646218	I want old Taku stuff.
7648641	7653628	Alright, we'll hear some of that, and then we'll be back, and we're going to do tonight's episode of Listless.
7653648	7655891	And remember, we're still looking for your ideas from the chat room.
7656551	7659355	I toy game I'd most like to see in DDR.
7659936	7660397	We'll be back.
7748089	7748249	and more.
7782170	7782831	Thanks for watching!
7964813	7968075	Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song.
7968635	7970357	Orange Lounge Radio.
7970897	7975440	We are back, and as promised, we're going to get into tonight's edition of Listless.
7975820	7977541	I think we need a theme song for Listless.
7977561	7979862	What's a good Bomani song that's like a theme song for Listless?
7980563	7981523	Um, Holic.
7982624	7984105	You can't do Holic again.
7984965	7989368	Um, I know the one that was the poppin' music video.
7990609	7991710	It sounds very game show-y.
7992510	7993110	Oh, Linus.
7993531	7993791	Yeah.
7993811	7993891	Yeah.
7994712	7996193	Uh, shit, do I have Linus?
7997093	8000414	I don't have that song readily available to me, um, oh!
8000574	8005996	But I thought, ooh, let's see if I can find, oh, damn, all my poppin' music special stuff is gone.
8006316	8011198	Oh, I know a good one, I know a good, because you said poppin' music, that made me think of a poppin' music song that would be really good, if I can find it.
8012658	8013899	Ah, crap, oh, here it is, here it is.
8014399	8017340	Yes, it's that, it's that, um, that toy-sounding song from Nine.
8021482	8023425	It's time to play Listless!
8027119	8029080	You can't fire a rod, you're not on the cast.
8029120	8032321	You're not on staff, you can't fire a rod.
8032341	8039823	In tonight's edition of Listless, we will be determining the eye toy game we most want to see in a DDR game.
8040304	8049287	The way that Listless works is that each host and each guest will make their list of three games that they want to see in an eye toy DDR.
8049787	8055989	After that, we will have the elimination round, where each person will take one thing off of the list.
8057330	8060092	After that, the chatroom will be able to vote!
8060432	8063054	So if you're not in the chatroom, join it now!

8068917	8072019	And now, let's play Listless!
8076302	8078583	Rob, you've scared me.
8079644	8081865	Beyond all capacity to be scared!
8083326	8084847	Except there's no slugs involved.
8085307	8086828	If there were slugs involved, I'd be even more scared.
8087139	8090200	In all seriousness, let's get to tonight's list.
8090440	8091000	Alright, let's see.
8091100	8093100	Eye toy game I most want to see in DDR.
8093160	8096041	Starting off tonight, who always starts us off?
8096081	8097662	The lovely DarkSakura.
8098102	8099062	Damn straight I'm lovely.
8099082	8099962	She's a trendsetter.
8100462	8101002	I sure am.
8101082	8103823	Number three eye toy game you most want to see in DDR.
8104503	8105403	Car wash the game.
8108724	8110025	Car wash the game.
8110085	8111285	Explain how this works.
8113065	8115226	You'd have your buckets on the ground and one would be your...
8116232	8122274	Your, uh, you know, sponge, and you'd wash the car, and then you'd have the hose, and you'd spray down the car.
8122354	8125095	And this, would this actually relate to DDR at all?
8125235	8125395	No.
8126656	8127176	Alright, fine.
8127456	8129137	How about you'll play Eurobeat while you do it?
8129237	8129497	Okay.
8129617	8130497	Alright, there you go.
8130557	8132878	I know, I know, better yet, how about Bikini Car Wash the game?
8133198	8133519	Alright.
8133859	8140281	Then, like, your icon, you just, like, you know, and so, like, the better you do, the hotter you are, and the more tips you get.
8140321	8141822	Okay, Bikini Car Wash the game.
8141862	8142222	Alright, fine.
8142242	8142542	That works.
8142702	8143642	I'll change it there, alright.
8143662	8146003	And if it's a guy, then it's Speedo Car Wash.
8146164	8147724	See, I was thinking the movie Car Wash.
8148084	8150765	At the car wash, yeah!
8151066	8152746	Alright, that could be playing in the background.
8152766	8153727	Alright, Angel.
8155488	8158249	Alright, then let's go to Arcadian42, since Angel's working here.
8158269	8162470	Arcadian42, number three eye toy game you would most like to see in DDR.
8162531	8165152	I just made a comment about that Car Wash.
8165192	8167753	As long as no one's carrying around a bucket of piss.
8169413	8169834	Okay!
8171431	8171812	3.
8171471	8171812	Lice Invaders
8185663	8188224	Watch out, they're coming down from the sky to attack your head.
8189304	8191004	Lice, Lice Invaders.
8192124	8193445	Okay, Lice Invaders.
8194065	8198306	And to relate this to DDR, Lice Invaders would also play Eurobeat in the background, correct?
8199326	8199746	I guess.
8199786	8200446	Alright, alright, fine.
8200866	8202327	Alright, Lice Invaders.
8204627	8205847	Alright, DDR Angel.
8206347	8209108	Number three eye toy game you would most like to see in DDR?
8209668	8213589	I couldn't really come up with anything for number three, so I just said Mini Papa Music or Mini 2DX.
8214150	8216091	Like a mini, like a chibi 2DX.
8216212	8216812	How about I say that?
8216832	8217492	Chibi 2DX.
8217553	8223457	Yeah, because I couldn't come up with anything else original.
8223857	8224918	Alright, that's fine, that's fine.
8224958	8225718	A little chibi game.
8225778	8226299	That'll be cute.
8226399	8233184	Alright, Loki, your number three pick for a high toy game I would most like to see in DDR.
8234104	8235445	My game is so awesome.
8239088	8240289	It's called Break Shit.
8245751	8251957	Basically, um... You are so bad in the face.
8252077	8254159	Okay.
8254820	8255921	Damn this yogurt!
8256522	8259124	Anyways, um, no, basically... Is your yogurt that hot?
8260105	8260646	Yes, it is.
8260726	8261566	It makes me giggle.
8262067	8266171	Anyways, um, no, basically what you do is an object would come on the screen.
8268055	8271336	And you're breaking!
8271716	8273757	Alright, Loki's suggesting break shit.
8274237	8277418	It's the iToy game he would most like to see in DDR.
8277518	8281739	Alright, and again, to relate this to DDR, Eurobeat Music would be playing in the background.
8281919	8283740	Alright, she breaks shit.
8284760	8285500	Yeah, Daikin Kai.
8285800	8291482	Alright, my number three game I would most like to see, iToy game I would most like to see in DDR, Whack-A-Child.
8293242	8294843	That sounds brilliant.
8296989	8297769	Whack a child.
8297830	8303052	Basically, as you play DDR, little children come on the screen and you have to whack them away.
8303593	8305754	So that would be my... Do you have the big orange bat icon?
8306294	8306714	You could.
8306754	8307935	That would be like the bonus stage.
8308075	8308315	Okay.
8308615	8308935	Alright.
8310456	8313238	Number two pick now from Jamie.
8314118	8316379	It would be something like the candy bar doll maker.
8316399	8318680	I don't know if you've seen all the dolls I've been posting in my live journal.
8319181	8319421	No.
8319841	8324904	Oh, well, I've been having this thing with the candy bar doll maker and this is...
8326129	8330812	It's like an interactive thing where you make the outfits and choose the hair and everything.
8331112	8339257	But you could use it to... If you want to see what the original candy bar was, it's candybar.co.kr.
8340058	8343020	But there's also an English one if you look it up on Google.
8343460	8347363	But anyway, you use the doll maker and you make your character for DDR.
8347783	8349524	And then you play as that character.
8350489	8354890	So you can drag the hair over and make him a boy or make him a girl.
8354910	8357091	That's the gayest game I've ever heard of, but all right, fine.
8357131	8361352	Candy bar doll game is what... And Eurobeat would play in the background while you do it.
8361732	8362573	Nope.
8362593	8362873	Nope.
8363233	8364753	It would be like the Oha music.
8364873	8365794	Okay, the Oha music.
8366214	8366514	All right.
8367534	8369355	Arcadian42, your number two pick.
8370935	8374076	Originally, I came up with the idea of head explode mode.
8375076	8376837	Or head explode mode, if you want to.
8378018	8381219	But I thought it'd maybe make it cooler, be the Evade the Assassin's Bullet game.
8381539	8383999	Where you see the red dot on your head, you have to avoid it.
8388060	8393182	Evade the Assassin's Bullet game, so a little red laser would appear on your head.
8394042	8394562	Exactly.
8394982	8399243	And if you don't move out of the way, then boom, your head explodes.
8399503	8402744	And if it actually explodes, that would make it a little bit more dangerous, and maybe a bit more fun.
8403880	8406222	It would work for Kami in Silent Scope mode.
8406422	8407944	Yes, there you go, Silent Scope mode.
8407964	8408945	There you go, Silent Scope mode.
8409185	8410286	Alright, brilliant.
8410406	8410746	I like it.
8410786	8412928	I'm going to put that in parentheses, Silent Scope.
8415471	8415751	Alright.
8417793	8419134	Angel, your number two pick.
8420055	8420516	Let's see.
8421957	8423819	Um, hell.
8423979	8426801	Okay, how about Mini Flashwater?
8427462	8429584	Do you remember that game from Mario Paint?
8430427	8433588	The thing where you just take the mouse and then like swaddle the flies and crap?
8433728	8435429	Mini fly, so the fly swatting game.
8436189	8438290	Yes, Nat Attack, that's what it was called, Nat Attack.
8438330	8440710	Yeah, I don't know, I just thought maybe that'd be kind of cool.
8441811	8443151	I'm not funny tonight, oh well.
8443491	8445692	That's alright, we're going to need some serious ones in here anyway.
8446032	8450974	Alright, Loki, your number two pick for eye toy game that you would like to see in DDR.
8451934	8455275	I'm looking at your list tonight because I can see your list over...
8455879	8458560	on your computer, and I can't help it, because it's funny.
8460101	8460381	All right.
8460481	8461281	Answer the damn question.
8461301	8462062	You're number two pick.
8462522	8463282	I can't.
8463703	8464643	He's laughing to her.
8464683	8465223	It's funny.
8466204	8466584	Say it.
8467544	8468185	No.
8470466	8471506	It's all your damn fault.
8471986	8474387	See, he starts giggling, and then I can't.
8474547	8476068	Okay, here's some serious thoughts.
8476108	8476948	Things that you like.
8477589	8477949	You know.
8479089	8479490	Okay.
8479710	8481631	Shooting RBGL children in the head.
8481651	8481711	Shh.
8484522	8487663	Okay, my next one is awesome.
8487743	8489164	It's basically, I'm itchy.
8489184	8495726	That sounds like a personal problem.
8497447	8498967	I think it's pretty self-explanatory.
8499127	8501888	You see this spot on your body, it gets red, itch it.
8503029	8504009	Do you have jock itch?
8506028	8508409	I'm Itchy is Loki's number two pick.
8509049	8517831	My number two pick, if Whack-A-Child wasn't quite good enough for you, then we have Whack-A-Parent would be the iToy game I would like to see.
8517911	8522952	Whack-A-Parent, because we all know that it's not really the kids' fault, it's their parents.
8523293	8525153	So Whack-A-Parent is my number two pick.
8525760	8527021	I would so own it at.
8527621	8527961	Alright.
8529462	8531103	Alright, Jamie, you're number two.
8531804	8532864	I'm sorry, you're number one.
8533865	8539909	My last one, the thing is, I don't, it would require that you be able to play with two eye toys, honestly.
8540089	8541349	Well, that's fine, you're innovative.
8541630	8541930	Okay.
8542910	8545852	It would be called, fuck with the other player's arrows mode.
8548706	8551368	Where you would basically reach over on their side.
8551388	8555851	You would actually reach over and rearrange their arrows.
8556292	8556732	Exactly.
8558253	8559234	Alright, I like that idea.
8559694	8561536	Seriously, think about how crazy that would be.
8561596	8563978	That would, like, do a whole new spin on Dance Battle.
8564818	8567740	Could you just, like, knock all your own arrows off the screen?
8567760	8568941	Yeah, you could do that.
8568981	8570703	You could shove your arrows over to their side.
8571303	8571643	Alright.
8572004	8573265	Actually, that reminds me of...
8574144	8585891	I don't know if anybody played You Don't Know Jack, but Volume 4 has this mode where it's nail mode where you just pound the N key and all these nails go on the question so you can't read it and the person has to guess.
8586311	8587271	They're like forced to guess.
8587332	8588192	All right.
8589453	8595516	All right, let's get the mic on over to Arcadium42 for his number one pick for iToy game I would most like to see in DDR.
8596497	8596837	All right.
8599056	8601621	My number one pick will be Dandruff White Christmas.
8601941	8606390	There would be little people on the bottom of the screen, and they're so wishing for a white Christmas.
8606795	8617242	and you are the number one producer of Dandruff and you are going to give them a nice white Christmas by shaking your head in various directions to make sure they have a beautiful, beautiful Christmas.
8617342	8620704	A lot of DDR players I know wouldn't need an eye toy actually for this.
8620784	8621264	No, I'm kidding.
8621565	8621925	Alright.
8622705	8624246	Dandruff white Christmas mode.
8624326	8625147	Very interesting.
8625207	8627468	Okay.
8627708	8629510	DDR Angel, your number one pick.
8630610	8632832	Actually, I'm going to be completely kidding and go with the mini butt game.
8633332	8633652	Darn it.
8633852	8634133	Laugh.
8634533	8635573	The mini butt game?
8635614	8636234	How does that work?
8637525	8640366	The WarioWare thing, remember?
8640426	8642407	You have to explain for those that don't know, though, our listeners.
8642427	8647008	Oh, well, okay, well, I wasn't, I was actually kidding about this answer, but I guess I'll keep it.
8647068	8647828	Oh, you didn't keep it?
8648569	8650029	Okay, I'll explain for those.
8650429	8658912	In WarioWare, there's this game where it says shoot, and you have to shoot water on this flower to make it spin, but the flower looks like an asshole.
8661561	8667186	So it looks like this moving bidet that you're using to shoot water up somebody's asshole.
8667447	8668568	Do you want to know my real answer?
8668628	8671210	So Angel wants to turn this into an eye toy game.
8671270	8672111	What was your real answer?
8672231	8676095	My real answer was going to be Mini Burger Time, but I don't know if that was going to work.
8676155	8677977	I know, I like the mini butt game.
8678878	8682261	I'm going to actually change that to Mini Water in Your Asshole.
8687415	8691997	Alright, so this is a mini water in your asshole.
8693617	8695318	Oh my god, how old are we, people?
8705261	8706041	Oh shit!
8706601	8709202	Roth is all red in the face now, this has got to be good.
8709282	8710142	Oh god, I love this.
8710502	8711283	Here, take the mic.
8715390	8716871	Alright, I'll do it, I'll do it.
8717831	8719972	No, make, no, make, make him do it.
8720492	8723494	Make him do it.
8724554	8725495	Make him say it.
8725715	8726055	Come here.
8727256	8727636	Come here.
8728376	8728696	Come here.
8729277	8729697	It's okay.
8730377	8730777	Deep breaths.
8734439	8734939	Alright, Loki.
8734979	8735840	Oh, the next one.
8737040	8738401	And my final one, number one.
8738861	8740722	I have plenty more where this came from, too.
8740742	8741402	This just happened to me.
8741422	8741683	You know what?
8741723	8742603	It comes to my head right now.
8743743	8744684	Yeah, I pulled it out of my ass.
8745428	8747832	This next one is basically like a quiz show game.
8749053	8753239	It's kind of like You Don't Know Jack, where you get like three questions.
8755262	8757425	And the problem will be that they're very hard.
8759147	8762232	So, if you get the question wrong...
8762924	8763744	You catch fire.
8766366	8768547	It's called answer question or catch fire.
8770948	8778511	And you can't flare around too much because otherwise fire burns faster when you're moving.
8783024	8786710	Answer question or catch fire is Loki's choice.
8787211	8792178	And don't flail around too much because the fire just grows that way.
8794221	8794662	Alright.
8799577	8801437	Now Loki's saying Burn Victim, the game.
8801477	8802077	Nope, too late.
8802598	8804898	It's Answer Question or Catch Fire.
8805458	8809639	Alright, and again, to relate this to DDR, Eurobeat Music would play in the background.
8809679	8810079	I should play.
8810459	8810919	Alright.
8812259	8824682	My number one pick for iToy game I would like to see in DDR, you've seen Whack-A-Child, you've seen Whack-A-Parent, but the best one by far is Whack-A-Politary is my number one choice.
8824702	8825502	Whack-A-Politary.
8827682	8828503	Wacka Politary.
8829223	8831225	Can't you just do that in, like, Tribuners Club?
8831446	8833147	Well, yeah, but that's a little different.
8833207	8835249	Actually, Politary would come out on the screen.
8835269	8842155	She would actually sing Broken My Heart, and you can punch her in the stomach to get her to stop.
8845928	8848349	Alright, so that's my number one answer, Wackapolitary.
8848689	8855732	Alright, now unfortunately comes the part where we have to eliminate one off the list apiece.
8855812	8858353	So, right now, here is the list as it stands.
8858393	8859253	Do you want to read this, Jamie?
8860433	8861234	Can you read it from back there?
8861274	8861614	Okay.
8861794	8862054	Alright.
8862334	8873398	Bikini Car Wash the Game, Life Invaders, Chibi 2D Extra Poppin' Music, Break Shit, Wacka Child, Candy Bar Doll Game,
8874348	8892025	Evade the Assassin's Bullet Silent Scope, Mini Flyswatter Nat Attack, I'm Itchy, Whack a Parent, Fuck with the Other Player's Arrows, Dandruff White Christmas, Mini Water in Your Ass all day.
8893086	8895088	Stop that, you're just trying to make me bust up, okay?
8897327	8900348	Answer Question or Catch Fire, or Whack-A-Politary.
8901008	8901388	You know what?
8901448	8904588	I should have read it like in that Margaret Cho, since we're talking about Margaret Cho in the chat room.
8904608	8906529	I should have done, God, I've been clitoris.
8907309	8907569	All right.
8907849	8908469	This is hard.
8908609	8910369	Honestly, these are all really good.
8910389	8910749	I've got my pick.
8910769	8915070	This is a very difficult elimination round for us because there's a lot of these that are fucking funny.
8915250	8915650	Yes, Angel?
8915810	8919951	One comment about the whole thing is, oh, my God, it's iToyMeetsWarriorWare.
8920231	8921251	iToyMeetsWarriorWare.
8921631	8921991	All right.
8922971	8924852	Jamie, you've got to take one off the list.
8924912	8925912	Which number is coming off?
8926748	8928089	Uh, Dandruff White Christmas goes.
8928449	8930250	Alright, Dandruff White Christmas, number 12.
8930290	8931150	Dandruff is nasty.
8932271	8933252	Alright, that's too bad.
8934032	8934332	Alright.
8934912	8935313	Fired!
8935973	8937334	Uh, Arcadian, your turn.
8937354	8938594	You gotta take one off the list.
8939095	8940715	I see I have too many whack things to say.
8940775	8941776	Whack a parent.
8942016	8942896	It's more fun to whack kids.
8944117	8948980	Alright, because it's more fun to whack kids than whack parents, whack a parent is coming off the list.
8949020	8949320	Alright.
8950100	8951561	Angel, one of these has to come off the list.
8956601	8960724	Um, I don't know.
8961404	8962164	Candy Bar Doll Game.
8963946	8965066	Candy Bar Doll Game.
8965086	8967307	Yeah, that was a little gay, Jamie, even you have to admit.
8968088	8968648	Yeah.
8969649	8970109	All right.
8970849	8972971	Loki, which one of these is coming off the list?
8975732	8982016	You know, as much as I don't like her, Wackapolitary, because Wacka Child is the best.
8984702	8985643	Wacka Child is pretty.
8985983	8988364	Alright, Wackapolitary comes off the list, that's fine.
8989345	8996469	Me, I have to take one off the list, and I've got to say, I'm just not feeling it for Chibi 2DX.
8996629	8997190	I'm sorry.
8997630	8998270	Sorry, Angel.
8998310	9000392	Yeah, why have a Bimani-related game in VR?
9000412	9002353	Yeah, why have a Bimani-related game in VR?
9002373	9004194	Because I couldn't think of anything!
9004354	9004734	Alright.
9005295	9006155	It's fine, it's fine.
9007716	9010818	You could just use the Loki method and just pull it out of your ass.
9013420	9013520	Ow.
9013540	9013580	Ow.
9015723	9016905	What did you say?
9017245	9018407	What were you going to do?
9018547	9018848	What?
9019168	9020730	We are not putting that on the air.
9020951	9022272	We are not putting that on the air.
9022413	9023654	Alright, damn.
9024135	9032687	See, that's why you people need to be in the studio to hear all of the really socially incorrect, politically incorrect statements that Loki makes when you can't hear him.
9032947	9033508	All right, here we go.
9033808	9034108	Here it is.
9034148	9036271	Eye toy game I most want to see in DDR.
9036331	9039014	Here is the list that you can vote for now in the chat.
9039414	9045481	Send one vote, your favorite, over to Sky via private message.

9067640	9070502	Mini Water In Your Asshole Game 14.
9070682	9072424	Answer Question Or Catch Fire
9073837	9075358	Place vote now.
9076399	9084224	Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your choice for what you would like to see win tonight's listless segment.
9084244	9090608	And we'll put that all together and we'll put that out on the air as soon as we have everybody's vote.
9092557	9093438	You got some other ones.
9093478	9093999	Yes, Loki.
9094460	9095941	I'm a crappy raver mode.
9096883	9098865	Oh, crappy raver mode would be fun.
9098885	9103031	Well, you know what my original number one was?
9103071	9104092	Interactive gal panic.
9107256	9109058	Dangle baby over balcony mode.
9111934	9114316	I'm actually going to open up the Skype line right now.
9114476	9121261	If anybody would like to send... Even though your suggestion is a little late to make the list, maybe there's something you want to vote for.
9121322	9123803	You want to persuade other people to vote on the list.
9123844	9130068	Or maybe you have a suggestion that was just really good and we missed it and that's just too damn bad because, you know, you don't make the list.
9130389	9132170	So the Skype line is open right now.
9132630	9134232	Let's see if anybody gives us a call.
9134892	9137094	Otherwise, I guess we're just going to have to go to a break, aren't we?
9138135	9139256	That's my ever...
9140757	9142398	Hey Sky, this is John Fields, can you hear me?
9142418	9142458	Hi!
9156914	9160876	Hey, I posted this a couple of times in the chat, but I guess you didn't see it.
9161036	9164038	Yeah, we were too busy laughing at answer question or catch fire.
9164058	9164798	They were all red in the face.
9164858	9165398	It was cute.
9166419	9174603	Actually, I was thinking you could combine the DDR pad with the eye toy to create something sort of like a samurai game.
9174983	9177724	He's saying... We're having a hard time hearing you.
9177744	9180586	I'm going to say that he's saying something about you could combine the DDR...
9182167	9186150	with the eye toy to make like a samurai game where you could run at each other type thing.
9186450	9188972	Right, and then a punch to attack, basically.
9189112	9190273	Kind of like mo-cap.
9190693	9192575	See, now that's a good serious answer.
9193175	9197679	Unfortunately, it's not funny, but it's actually a good answer as far as serious ones are concerned.
9197859	9201202	I always thought they should have used the eye toy to make like a mo-cap boxing at home.
9202703	9204184	Any other suggestions you got for us, John?
9205065	9205765	That was it, basically.
9205845	9208968	Alright, well that's actually a decent one, so you might want to send that on over to Konami.
9208988	9209348	You never know.
9210424	9211745	Alright, thanks for calling.
9212366	9212746	No problem.
9212846	9213246	Bye-bye.
9214287	9216129	Let's see if I can answer this call real fast, it's coming in.
9216989	9218110	Hey, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9218891	9220172	Hello, Sky, Siggy here.
9220332	9221313	Hey, Siggy, how you doing?
9222714	9224235	Yeah, hey, I'm doing fine.
9224555	9225476	What's your suggestion?
9226917	9228939	I never had that kind of laugh since episode 69.
9229820	9233483	He has not laughed that hard since episode 69 when Loki sang I'm Coming Out.
9233503	9234303	I wasn't here.
9234523	9235924	I know, you weren't even here, Jamie.
9236145	9238987	Alright, well, which one made you laugh the most?
9239650	9242711	Well, of course, the one that says number 13.
9243751	9246271	I really can, you know, the chatters right now.
9246551	9247672	Go for number 13.
9247912	9252733	Number 13, the mini water in your asshole game is the one that made him laugh the most.
9253073	9254693	I was laughing really hard.
9255153	9257534	Oh, my stomach, you know, my stomach's really hurting.
9258414	9261315	Well, I'm glad we could cause you such pain here on Orange Log Radio.
9262755	9263615	Take a deep breath.
9264035	9265195	Are you okay?
9265415	9265976	Breathe in.
9266156	9268176	Did you have any suggestions you wanted to pass along?
9270874	9271474	We can barely hear you.
9271494	9272455	Speak into your mic a little more.
9273055	9274016	Just, uh, that's it.
9274036	9274696	Just an episode.
9274856	9275777	Yeah, I mean, uh, episode.
9275937	9278018	I mean, uh, vote for number 13.
9278198	9280840	Alright, he's just saying vote for number 13, Mini Water in Your Asshole Game.
9280880	9281721	Alright, we'll see, Siggy.
9281761	9282121	We'll see.
9283035	9283675	Thanks for calling!
9284256	9284536	Later!
9284616	9285036	Have a good one!
9311330	9315615	Alright, so we'll be back after this break of Taka music while you guys vote on tonight's list list.
9315675	9315915	Enjoy!
9399961	9400722	Thanks for watching!
9450376	9454397	My bad, I got a location test one in there, so let's do a better quality Takasong.
9454477	9454957	Let's do this one.
9462694	9464477	Thank you for watching!
9540491	9540793	Thank you.
9607040	9607981	Thanks for watching!
9640625	9641466	Thanks for watching!
9670289	9671289	Thank you for watching!
9704850	9709631	From the Step Squad to Orange Lab, this PDR sucks!
9710032	9720435	Holla, Holla, Holla, Holla, Holla, Holla, Holla, Holla, Holla, Holla, Holla, Holla, Holla, Holla, Holla,
9735382	9735742	All right.
9736803	9738784	Yeah, you had to go worship the porcelain goddess.
9740704	9741125	No.
9741465	9742005	I'm just teasing.
9742105	9742325	Okay.
9742365	9742605	All right.
9744326	9745266	So we've got to get this in.
9745406	9747848	Hopefully we have a little bit of time for Ask Orange Lounge, but I don't know.
9748448	9749648	We definitely have to get this segment in.
9750069	9753830	Why is it, Jamie, that we have to do these FUs every single week?
9754090	9755531	Sometimes you've just got to let it out.
9774238	9779859	My first FU goes to the almost entirety of traffic on the road today.
9780339	9785021	Which is why I stand by my desire to have a Humvee with a freaking missile launcher on it.
9786881	9788041	I finally saw it in action.
9788081	9794903	I found a movie file on Military.com of a Humvee with a missile launcher blowing up a tank.
9795763	9797224	And that was so hot to me.
9798928	9801689	So, I decided that I really, really have to have one now.
9803249	9809110	So, uh... So, I need one for traffic.
9810050	9820112	Another FU goes toward, uh... I'm getting a little panicky about school, so I guess this sort of goes to me for being kind of panicky about it.
9820552	9828154	Another FU goes toward not having time and money and the ability to go visit who I want to.
9828254	9828634	Although...
9829255	9837780	I am planning on going to Alabama in November, so I'll come back, accent and all, and you'll have to make fun of me, and I'll go, I'll fuck y'all.
9841181	9848425	Another one goes toward, I'm going to be very general with this and say people who just don't get it.
9849186	9854689	You know, you tell them, and you point it out, and they just don't get it, you know?
9855149	9857230	Those people just, uh-uh-uh, no.
9858491	9858571	Um...
9861767	9866389	Another FU goes toward that stupid introduction to Windows class that I have to take.
9866970	9868050	Well, you know what I say?
9868771	9870151	Dear class, fuck you.
9870191	9872292	I'm petitioning the dean so I can test out of it.
9872412	9872793	Thank you.
9873393	9874013	I think I'm done.
9874293	9876775	Oh yeah, another one goes to allergies and not having any sinus medicine.
9878235	9881917	Alright, let's move on to Loki and his FUs of the week.
9885879	9889401	My first FU goes to stupid trees which limbs keep falling off of.
9890100	9895224	I swear to God, I know I'm going to be walking to the apartment during the night all of a sudden this limb is going to fall on me.
9895624	9896445	And that's going to suck.
9898526	9900488	Also, fuck you, the SUV drivers.
9901088	9909334	I swear to God, I just saw, like, yesterday, two different instances where SUVs crashed into things.
9909935	9911796	First one being into a truck.
9913257	9917500	And the second time, a Humvee jumped the rail and hit another car.
9918001	9918381	Because...
9919858	9922283	It was an H2.
9922403	9923324	It's not a real Hummer.
9923805	9925689	Yeah, it's not a real Hummer, but, you know.
9927512	9929095	An H2.
9929535	9930497	And it was a woman.
9930737	9931679	It was a woman driving it.
9931759	9933062	I bet you she was on a cell phone, too.
9935955	9938516	I want to sort of insert a nephew there to the H2.
9938637	9939437	They look like shit.
9939797	9940077	Yeah.
9940337	9944339	If you want a Hummer, you freaking get one that looks like it's, you know, armored.
9944700	9947021	That it can run over buildings and live.
9947301	9950162	See, I don't have a problem with women driving SUVs or anything like that.
9950282	9953564	It's just when you drive with cell phones and don't pay attention to shit.
9954164	9960708	Then you get into accidents and they kill people because I know there was a stretcher there and they were sure as hell blocking traffic, so...
9962309	9964290	Anyways, fuck you to them.
9964971	9968954	And, um... Fuck you to Alien vs. Predator.
9969975	9971716	Goddammit, that was a waste of two hours.
9972597	9974218	But it was a funny-ass movie.
9975259	9976380	Alien vs. Predator.
9977200	9980142	Yeah, who'd have thunk it that it was a buddy comedy?
9981664	9982624	My god, lame.
9982664	9984506	But, you know, I should have known better going into it.
9986848	9988489	And, finally, um...
9991644	9992264	I don't know, that's it.
9992365	9992725	I'm done.
9993645	9994726	Oh, that's right.
9994946	9995907	Fuck you to my co-worker.
9996547	9999609	Actually, this is quite funny because this is the one that was sleeping around.
10000310	10001911	She's getting demoted.
10006614	10007595	She couldn't cut it.
10009436	10013579	Shows you that it takes more than just sleeping around to get into sales, bitch.
10014479	10015580	Alright, that's all.
10023649	10024090	My turn.
10024671	10025573	F you to getting sick.
10026115	10031226	And F you to having a special friend that you keep passing diseases back and forth to.
10033385	10034766	I mean, like, colds, people.
10035126	10036147	Don't think dirty.
10036967	10041369	Also, I would like to say a big F you to faggoty drama queens.
10041850	10046092	And I know that faggot is a derogatory term, and I don't use it unless I really mean it, okay?
10046432	10048513	This guy I know, he's a real faggot, okay?
10049414	10050795	And I'm gay, so I'm allowed to say that word.
10050815	10053576	Like, there's a difference between a gay person and, like, a total faggot, okay?
10053936	10058279	And this guy pisses me off because he is such a fucking drama queen.
10058299	10059379	You wouldn't even imagine.
10059720	10062101	Like, I haven't seen this guy in, like, five years.
10062614	10070918	And then, like, last night, I ran into him, and there was just this aura of just, like, drama-ness that you wouldn't even look me in the eye.
10071819	10078902	As much as I just wanted to say hi and just be like, okay, so, like, hi, you know, our drama's five years old, let's get over it.
10079483	10080103	Nope, denied.
10080663	10081044	So whatever.
10081804	10082204	Fuck that.
10083265	10083645	I'm done.
10085306	10086206	But that's all I have to say.
10088107	10090688	Moving on, let's go to Angel and Arcadian.
10090708	10091069	Who has a mic?
10091149	10091529	Arcadian!
10096007	10103110	Okay, first off, uh, fuck you to these horrible commercials, these horrible radio commercials, fucking kids.
10104070	10106471	Uh, like every 15 minutes these goddamn kids come on.
10106832	10107272	Oh, eh!
10107692	10110513	Yes, that's the commercial I fucking hate the Paul Zonka commercial.
10110853	10112874	Those damn kids are so fucking annoying.
10112934	10116556	I just want to shoot the goddamn radio for the stupid kids.
10118096	10119557	Wish I could stab them through the radio.
10119577	10122518	Oh no, I'm dying.
10122718	10123739	No, can't do more radio.
10125230	10126150	Uh, let's see, what else?
10126430	10132112	Uh, fuck you to radio commercials that have songs that say, oh, I like this song.
10132512	10133692	And then it's a fucking commercial.
10134152	10135773	I hope your business goes down in flames.
10136833	10144035	Unfortunately, it's like one of those damn car dealerships of Satan that will keep going forever in the space of a 20.
10144775	10149936	Uh, fuck you to the trees that work that pour sap on my car.
10150825	10158671	I can't really afford to, and fuck you that I can't afford to actually go to the car wash to get at least some of it off without having to scrape and scrub and everything.
10160293	10168299	Uh, yeah, fuck you to not, uh, being nearly penniless, having to plan out months in advance where my money is going.
10168899	10171061	But hopefully that'll change in like a month or two.
10172782	10174263	And fuck you to not be able to go places.
10174784	10177406	And not be able to go to the arcades or anything.
10179281	10181023	and, yeah, that's all.
10181663	10182704	Alright, DDR Angel.
10183405	10193253	Alright, uh, well, I know you guys have, uh, said this FU over and over and over again, but see, now that I live here, I really know what you're talking about.
10193573	10205363	Um, FU to the freaking stupid drivers around here, because they've almost killed us, like, I don't know, at least, uh, five times that I can recall this week while driving around Sacramento, so it's like,
10206905	10221653	and also FU to the main post office in Sacramento because they have still decided to hold our mail so we're not getting all of it like we should be.
10222334	10224215	But well, I guess that's the...
10225589	10226869	I don't know, downside to moving.
10227609	10233091	Also, Magus wants to send an FU to big work servers going down.
10233831	10242812	Because now he's going to have to explain himself on Wednesday as to why the server went down for four hours.
10243013	10245513	So he's going to have some extra work to do, it looks like.
10245773	10246093	Oh well.
10247333	10248754	Alright, I guess that's it.
10249074	10251774	Alright, let's move on to our chatroom FUs, shall we?
10251814	10252054	Alright.
10257307	10269531	Unknown Gamer wants to say, I want to send a big heaping F you to Loki for calling your reign R&B shit.
10270311	10273252	Go back and tend to whatever Bomani artist you're into.
10273272	10275153	To his cock, fanboy.
10276073	10278074	And you can throw in an I love DarkSakura thing.
10278094	10279294	She's my online hag now.
10280711	10281452	That's so cool.
10281832	10286055	Any response to you being an asshole for calling your reign R&B shit?
10287176	10287416	No?
10287456	10292240	Because it's still shit, even though, whether you think it's not or, you know, whatever.
10292480	10293020	It's still shit.
10293160	10293861	It'll always be shit.
10295462	10295802	Whatever.
10297944	10298504	Moving on.
10298965	10299725	Panda wants to say...
10301112	10305334	Panda wants to say F you to Sky for counting my vote as California Dreamin'.
10305734	10308436	Anyways, I like the version off the DJ Sammy CD better.
10309036	10315479	For your information, Panda, I counted your vote for song 2 because I saw that you changed it.
10316160	10316580	Bitch!
10318861	10319802	Wow, that was really brutal.
10320022	10323784	I just probably, I just totally chastised one of our listeners.
10324504	10324624	Yes.
10324664	10326525	See, now this is crap, okay?
10327746	10328306	This is crap.
10331736	10333378	Alright, moving on.
10333898	10340965	ViolentHyperGirl says, F you to fabboys and F you to three-dimensional calculus when it involves solving the moment of inertia in some solid object.
10341285	10344168	Because it involves three intervals, each of which takes almost a third of a page.
10344208	10345209	Okay, I'm getting bored here.
10346470	10349252	Also, F you to leaving my friend's birthday party on Saturday night.
10349673	10352996	If I didn't have to go to Davis the next day, I would have stayed all night and just caught a ride with someone.
10353016	10354297	But yeah, and F you to ants.
10354357	10355138	They need to die.
10355458	10356039	Heart raid.
10358489	10362171	By the way, an FU goes to a particular person who acts like they know everything.
10362211	10363372	You are an idiot, period.
10363933	10366574	I don't like saying FUs to individuals in particular.
10367355	10371898	RightChan says, FU to drama queens that blame the drama on everyone else and break up a community in the process.
10371978	10372598	Ooh, I agree with that.
10373279	10378602	FU to garbage that is on welfare and feels they need to have children because their boyfriend is going to take care of me.
10378842	10379843	Amen to that.
10382975	10385576	Dark Tetsuya says, F you to keyboard hotkeys.
10385636	10387878	I hit one on accident and it shut down my computer.
10389559	10400544	MJB says, my F you of the week goes to goddamn toysandjoys.com for sending me my Max 2 Japanese after two weeks of waiting but forgetting to send party collection.
10400945	10402065	I hate you, Toys and Joys.
10402886	10403186	You know what?
10403226	10406468	I've got a free copy of Fantasy Star Collection.
10406488	10406808	I don't know.
10409306	10415970	John Field says, F you to Microsoft and XP Service Pack 2 again because I'm still crashing.
10416130	10417151	F you to the laws of physics.
10417171	10419873	It would be much easier if I didn't need to use any fuel to drive my car.
10420333	10421634	F you to moving between dorm rooms.
10424616	10432801	Misty says, the closest thing to a real F you that I've gotten this week is to myself for not being able to think shit up for my RPG and the works of fanfiction I've got.
10434551	10441797	Lunarius says F you to physical distance because I found a guy online that I really like but he lives hundreds of miles from me.
10444400	10448943	Dark Knight says F you to the USA basketball team for getting the ass kicked by Puerto Rico today.
10450084	10450765	That is kind of funny.
10453823	10468597	SaoZao, I hope I said that right, SaoZao says, uh, F you to my connection for being so shitty, fuck you, uh, F you Nickel City for ripping off Konami and using Step Mania, woo, uh, Konami, or uh, Nickel City.
10470202	10478750	DDRHolic says, F you to people who get pissed at you when you aren't driving fast enough and when the reason you aren't driving fast enough is because the idiot in front of you isn't driving fast enough.
10479370	10487357	F you to people who think that they own the entire public road system and drive like there are no fucking rules anywhere but their own rules, driving wherever they want, whenever they want.
10488118	10493563	F you to people who think they have special privileges, such as parking in front of the grocery store in the red zone to load their fucking groceries.
10494332	10496754	Load their fucking groceries like the rest of us motherfuckers.
10497075	10505923	I've even seen someone pull their SUV out of the handicap parking spot to the front of the store to load their fucking groceries like they weren't close enough to the grocery store in the first place.
10507945	10513350	And lastly, oh, that wasn't even an FU, but it was a personal question for me from somebody.
10513390	10514491	So I guess that was the last one.
10516393	10516853	Oh, I know.
10517013	10517454	Sad, huh?
10518061	10530646	Wow, about the Toys and Joys FU, that's the first time I've actually heard someone negatively bash them, except for when I didn't get my controller, but I got it five days later, so it doesn't matter.
10532407	10534408	I have never had a problem with Toys and Joys.
10534688	10543512	When we were really big into the Sega Ages 2500, we had ordered a bunch of games from there, and all of our others arrived,
10544056	10549301	They actually sent me an email saying, you know, Fantasy Star, we were at a Fantasy Star collection.
10549781	10550782	Would you like to cancel the order?
10550822	10552463	I said, well, sure, go ahead and cancel it.
10552563	10553404	You know, we'll wait on that.
10553905	10555106	And they had shipped it anyway.
10556487	10558889	So we were actually never charged for a Fantasy Star collection.
10561331	10562812	All right, we are done.
10565314	10569558	Actually, when I ordered my Guitar Freaks controllers, I had them two days later.
10571573	10571873	All right.
10574454	10575614	That's it for the FUs tonight.
10575674	10576655	We've got all our FUs in.
10577575	10580116	Are we ready to hear about tonight's listless?
10580896	10581937	Sure, Rob.
10582697	10583217	Are we ready?
10586278	10589799	And now to announce the winners of tonight's listless.
10590079	10590759	Fuck this song.
10590900	10593040	As a reminder, here is tonight's topic.
10594141	10598162	A iToy minigame I would most like to see in DDR.
10598622	10600823	You voted, and here are the results.
10601602	10603883	In third place, we have a tie.
10604724	10608166	Our third place winner number one is Break Shit.
10608806	10610307	Yay!
10610707	10614449	Our third place winner number two is Whack A Child.
10614630	10615510	Yay!
10616731	10622034	Our second place winner in tonight's list list is Fuck With The Other Players Arrows.
10622054	10622154	Yay!
10624202	10632288	And tonight's winner for iToy minigame I would most like to see in DDR is... Mini Water in Your Asshole game!
10635950	10639533	Oh, and Answer Question or Catch Fire also got third place!
10640053	10643496	This is where Angel's, uh, thought bubble goes dot dot dot, I won?
10643676	10643796	What? !
10645202	10645843	I know, me too.
10645963	10646563	Dot, dot, dot.
10646623	10648164	Yeah, but you had a little help from the rest of us.
10648625	10651787	You were going to say the WarioWare thing, and nobody got that.
10651807	10654109	It was much funnier when we said water in your asshole.
10654370	10655611	That is the WarioWare thing.
10655651	10656391	Never mind.
10657912	10660415	I guess it was better than that BurgerTime thing.
10663917	10678506	Alright, and showing the true mentality age of most of our chat room chatters and our listeners, the game that has the word asshole in it wins, so good job.
10678526	10682068	I think that's the first time that that's actually happened.
10682208	10685350	Other thoughts of mine were like, regulate your brain.
10685871	10686792	Thank you for watching!
10701593	10708139	Or like, my favorite, call the assurance inspector at a toy factory mode.
10708179	10713744	Basically, you get to throw in a bunch of sharp razor blades and stuff into the stuffed animals.
10714024	10719809	But see, you have certain items that you can put in the animals, and you just have to get the right one, depending on what it is.
10719889	10726936	I was thinking of one that's like that, there was one of those little flash games that was where you would have this
10728732	10732193	Phallus, and shoot into these condoms as they went by.
10733194	10734935	They should have, like, Condom Tester, the game.
10736535	10742358	Angel, I have some questions for you as the author of... Oh, shit.
10742998	10743998	What, Loki, what?
10746980	10751661	This is like, okay, there's the line, and I'm crossing it.
10752922	10754523	Do your own abortion mode.
10754543	10755363	Stop.
10757697	10758477	You're horrible.
10759118	10759438	All right.
10761018	10766660	Angel, as the author of Mini Water in Your Asshole Game, I have some questions.
10767301	10768721	Have you ever played Eye Toy Groove?
10769341	10769521	No.
10769601	10772943	You know how Eye Toy Groove takes pictures and video of you as you play?
10773403	10776404	Would Mini Water in Your Asshole Game do the same thing?
10778260	10788682	Oh god, now I'm thinking of that stupid, um... What was that really fucked up Japanese game that had the vibrator shit?
10788722	10789162	Rez?
10789262	10789582	Rez.
10790263	10790623	God.
10790643	10793703	I know, like, there's the Abunga game.
10794323	10795944	Where you stick the finger in the ass.
10797584	10798184	Abunga Bunga.
10798344	10799985	Somebody in our chatroom actually suggested that.
10800005	10800625	I saw that go by.
10801425	10805366	I can't believe, though, that Abunga actually was, like, a real game and they had a party for it and everything.
10806426	10806546	Um...
10807682	10810263	My other question about mini water in your asshole game.
10810763	10814104	Once you get the water in your asshole, would you be able to shoot it back out?
10818866	10821807	On that note, it's about time to end the show here.
10821907	10824848	So we're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
10824929	10827169	DDR Angel, your final thought, please.
10832311	10833752	I did not expect the...
10834676	10835716	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10859272	10859612	I don't know.
10859732	10861133	People actually chose what I wanted to do.
10861513	10861913	Alright.
10862113	10862913	Get over yourself.
10862993	10865334	Alright.
10865994	10868435	Arcadian42, your final thought, please.
10874397	10875377	Things may be looking up.
10875517	10876758	My future may be coming on.
10877498	10878118	Yay.
10878859	10880019	Loki, your final thought, please.
10885661	10886741	I'm tired.
10888302	10888962	I like my yogurt.
10889980	10891000	That's going to suck later.
10893461	10901464	Alright, my final thought is I hope you all have a wonderful week and listen to Orange Launch Radio lots.
10903505	10910287	And I was going to make an announcement about Vanilla Sky coming back, but I guess we'll wait for next week.
10910307	10911747	We haven't plugged the shows!
10912167	10913268	I know we haven't plugged the shows.
10913628	10916249	Listen to Orange Launch Radio every weeknight and hear something cool.
10916329	10916609	The end.
10917679	10947195	because the rewinds are coming back as well the rewinds will be back on Thursday Thursday nights by popular demand the Orange Lounge Radio Rewind and probably we're looking I actually might bump it up a little bit to like 6 o'clock so our East Coast friends don't have to stay up so late to hear the show maybe even 5 we'll see my final thought is actually listen to Pump Up the Volume on Tuesday night starting at I tend to start around a quarter to 7 if I get early but usually pre-show starts at 7 show starts at 7.30 goes to whenever
10948470	10950312	I will likely be doing homework the whole time.
10951112	10956777	Um, but, uh, I'm thinking, you know, I play a lot of dancey, happy, crappy stuff.
10957417	10961060	I'm just gonna go for broke and say, screw you, R-I-A-A.
10961640	10973970	I'm playing Metallica S&M concert and, like, a bunch of hair rock and, like, some Rammstein and, uh, and, uh, I don't know, I might throw in some, like, uh,
10975149	10976570	Danzig, and Henry Rollins.
10977151	10977891	Just for the hell of it.
10978832	10980893	Nothing happy, dancy, poppy for me.
10981514	10982334	Okay, maybe a little bit.
10982354	10982975	Maybe the pre-show.
10984956	10985577	And some Enflo.
10985637	10988179	I'll play some Enflo to make the Enflo people happy.
10988979	10991421	I will play some Enflo and Crystal K. I love that.
10991941	10996165	But it's mostly going to be the Metallica S&M concert.
10996425	10998927	Because that's just really, really freaking rad.
11000047	11000408	Alright.
11000868	11002309	That should be a very interesting show then.
11002809	11003870	Oh, hell yeah!
11004130	11004851	Excuse me.
11005333	11005613	Vortex
