Oh, the sweet child saves me

00:05.000 --> 00:10.000
And so long that confines me

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Confines me

01:19.000 --> 01:36.000
Yesterday, back and forth, broken doors no longer open

01:36.000 --> 01:45.000
Breaking down, even now, love is gonna ruin those days

01:45.000 --> 01:51.000
Not again, not again, not again

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
A dream I can't awake

01:54.000 --> 01:59.000
What is real, what is real, what is real

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
It's cutting hard for me to take

02:02.000 --> 02:07.000
What I need, what I need, what I need

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
A little bit of the night

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
And the white sugar's in the eyes

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
Oh, the sweet sugar saves me

02:22.000 --> 02:27.000
Heckle when they confide in me

02:52.000 --> 03:18.760

We're not going to, I've got to clarify something though.

07:43.060 --> 07:47.940
We're not blatantly giving you the song, we're just giving you a little kick in the ass.

07:47.940 --> 07:51.300
Give me a little kick in the ass to get you charged up and figure out what that song is

07:51.300 --> 07:53.020
all about.

07:53.020 --> 07:57.580
All this and plenty of Bomani news, How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day, Ask Orange Lounge,

07:57.580 --> 08:00.920

When we come back from this break, featuring songs from Popin' Music 11, Woot, in this

08:07.060 --> 08:12.220
break we're going to hear a Sana song called Space Dog, Megumi with Frost, and a little

08:12.220 --> 08:14.300
bit of Hong Kong magic from Yamato.

08:14.300 --> 08:16.300
We'll be right back.

08:16.300 --> 08:26.300
A day ago, on a space door, to the next room in order stop.

08:26.300 --> 08:34.300
Can you hear me on a space door? The earth is shining through.

08:34.300 --> 08:43.300
A day ago, on a space door, to seek my mother goodnight now.

08:43.300 --> 08:57.300
I remember the time, when I was born

08:57.300 --> 09:08.300
You were searching to me, in the games that made me glad

09:08.300 --> 09:12.300
One day he told to me

09:12.300 --> 09:17.300
I'll go home, you will get to see

09:17.300 --> 09:20.300
And let us go, he's my friend

09:20.300 --> 09:26.300
Never mind, you'll be born and born

09:26.300 --> 09:30.300
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

09:30.300 --> 09:33.300
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

09:33.300 --> 09:35.300
Oh, oh, oh, oh

09:35.300 --> 09:37.300
Can you believe in me?

09:37.300 --> 09:39.300
I'm glad you're up

09:39.300 --> 09:41.300
You're gonna be lucky

09:41.300 --> 09:43.300
Under the light

09:43.300 --> 09:47.300
And the reason I'm sad

09:47.300 --> 09:51.300
Is to leave you for a long time

09:51.300 --> 09:54.300
Don't care on me

09:54.300 --> 09:56.300
I'm glad you're up

09:56.300 --> 09:58.300
I'm gonna be lucky

09:58.300 --> 10:04.300
Under the sun

10:34.300 --> 10:36.300
I

11:04.300 --> 11:06.300

13:11.700 --> 13:41.220
Hi, this is Mel B of RTF.

13:41.220 --> 13:46.720
And for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend, Melody, can join us on all the fun together.

13:46.720 --> 13:50.260
Hey, hey, if you're a broke-ass like I am, why don't you come to the one place that costs

13:50.260 --> 13:53.740
absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.

13:53.740 --> 13:56.260
It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.

13:56.260 --> 14:00.980
Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.

14:00.980 --> 14:03.260
Gee, that guy sounds awfully familiar.

14:03.260 --> 14:04.260
I...

14:04.260 --> 14:05.260
Honestly, that was.

14:05.260 --> 14:07.360
He sounds like somebody I've heard from very recently.

14:07.360 --> 14:09.700
He sounds very, very familiar to me.

14:09.700 --> 14:10.700
How you doing, Flow-Walk?

14:10.700 --> 14:15.460

14:15.460 --> 14:20.480

15:35.440 --> 15:46.320
Interview. We got interviewed for a magazine. For a Lifetime magazine. Like

15:46.320 --> 15:55.880
Lifetime TV for women? I guess so. For the fitness benefits of DDR.

15:55.880 --> 16:08.960
So, coming up next on Lifetime, Sally Field stars in My Burning Vagina, a story about

16:08.960 --> 16:15.000
a woman overcoming her vaginal difficulties in that time of the month.

16:15.000 --> 16:20.080
Also coming up, Sharks Girl and Dark Sakura, interviewed about DDR.

16:20.080 --> 16:34.200
Did you hear how DDR helped them overcome their burning vaginas?

16:34.200 --> 16:40.160
God I love this show.

16:40.160 --> 16:42.280
We jumped the shark like when?

16:42.280 --> 16:44.200
Like episode 2?

16:44.200 --> 16:45.200
Episode 2.

16:45.200 --> 16:47.600
Because I wasn't here.

16:47.600 --> 16:48.600
That set the pace.

16:48.600 --> 16:58.700
going on vacation for two weeks like bye y'all I'm going to Alabama anyway um so

16:58.700 --> 17:07.560

17:07.560 --> 17:12.020
school spent a lot of time at school did homework because I still have no

17:12.020 --> 17:16.940
air-conditioning that's coming up in the FUs of the week and that's really by the

17:16.940 --> 17:20.620
By the way, as a reminder, Orensons Radio is based in the Sacramento Valley, where we

17:20.620 --> 17:23.140
get temperatures of 110 degrees in the summertime.

17:23.140 --> 17:26.860
Yeah, and if you don't have AC, it sucks!

17:26.860 --> 17:31.020
And if you don't have AC in your car, it sucks even more, because I could have just escaped

17:31.020 --> 17:32.020
to my car.

17:32.020 --> 17:36.260
Dan's like, summer's almost over, we don't have to get AC for your car now.

17:36.260 --> 17:42.220
As my mother said, you use the old, uh, as my mother said, you use the old, uh, two and

17:42.220 --> 17:43.220
seventy trick.

17:43.220 --> 17:46.260
You roll down two windows and drive seventy miles an hour.

17:46.260 --> 17:50.260
You know what? That would work if one of my windows would roll down.

17:50.260 --> 17:52.260
You's in the ghetto.

17:52.260 --> 17:59.260
Dude, no, it's not. I don't know what it is, but after my car got raped it hasn't been the same.

17:59.260 --> 18:00.260
Your car got raped?

18:00.260 --> 18:01.260
My car got raped, remember?

18:01.260 --> 18:04.260
Did it have a burning vagina afterwards?

18:04.260 --> 18:05.260
It got raped in the side.

18:05.260 --> 18:06.260
Oh, okay.

18:06.260 --> 18:07.260
Remember when they broke into my...

18:07.260 --> 18:08.260
Oh my God, it got raped in the ear?

18:08.260 --> 18:09.260
Yeah.

18:09.260 --> 18:10.260
Amazing.

earlier who is being an asshole to everybody so now he doesn't get to play

18:38.060 --> 18:43.120

18:43.120 --> 18:46.840

18:46.840 --> 18:51.340

i found out

19:10.160 --> 19:12.780
uh... i mean

19:12.780 --> 19:14.320
what uh...

19:14.320 --> 19:19.140
okay i found out that there is a haunted house by my old house that i used to live at that

19:19.140 --> 19:21.200
i just moved away from

19:21.200 --> 19:23.060
no it's not the fort but you know what

19:23.060 --> 19:25.800
i was gonna blame it on loki's little uh...

19:25.800 --> 19:30.040
portal from hell but i can't because it's not even built yet

19:30.040 --> 19:31.360
and then

19:31.360 --> 19:33.720
after i found out about the house

19:33.720 --> 19:34.760
uh...

19:34.760 --> 19:41.140
I found out that two days ago it miraculously burned down without affecting any of the vegetation

19:41.140 --> 19:44.340
around it or the tree, or the oak tree that was right next to it.

19:44.340 --> 19:47.300
I see burning as a running theme on tonight's show.

19:47.300 --> 19:48.300
Apparently.

19:48.300 --> 19:50.460
Was it someone's vagina that...

19:50.460 --> 19:51.460
Ah, da, da, da.

19:51.460 --> 19:52.460
Ah, da, da.

19:52.460 --> 19:53.460
Okay, okay, enough.

19:53.460 --> 19:55.260
Let the joke die.

19:55.260 --> 19:57.020
Step away from the joke.

19:57.020 --> 20:01.060
Speaking of joke, should I reveal it now or later?

20:01.060 --> 20:03.300
I think we need to do Loki's present now.

20:50.660 --> 20:51.700
upon all jokes

20:51.700 --> 20:53.940
i thought it was really cool

20:53.940 --> 20:59.420
hopefully he likes it

20:59.420 --> 21:02.060
it must go on the webcam oh my other side

21:02.060 --> 21:03.620
it's a little baby

21:03.620 --> 21:08.700
yes it is but what does the baby what is the baby holding

21:08.700 --> 21:12.620
did it drop something i think it dropped something

21:12.620 --> 21:17.020
besides the card

21:17.020 --> 21:19.620
i had a little help with the artwork but uh...

21:19.620 --> 21:24.300
for those uh... listening at home loki has been given an iraqi suicide baby for

21:24.300 --> 21:27.420
his birthday

21:27.420 --> 21:31.200
for those of you who have been listening about fifty episodes ago you'll get that inside joke

21:31.200 --> 21:34.460
at the bed and then i went ahead and then it's a bad and i don't think it's

21:34.460 --> 21:36.200
one that you know

21:36.200 --> 21:38.740
burnt to the ground but i had to bring it yet

21:38.740 --> 21:40.240
okay anything

21:40.240 --> 21:41.500
i thought it was cool

21:41.500 --> 21:42.660
i'll be like that

21:42.660 --> 21:47.660
anything on the webcam now

21:47.660 --> 21:54.660
it

21:54.660 --> 21:56.660
He broke the webcam! For five seconds!

21:59.660 --> 22:01.660
Alright, moving on.

22:03.660 --> 22:06.660
Angel, is there anything else you want to talk about with your week?

22:06.660 --> 22:10.660
Not that I can think of at the moment. I will probably get the mic later.

22:11.660 --> 22:15.660
Then let's speak to Mr. Floatwalk. How was your week? How was your day?

22:15.660 --> 22:22.660
Ah, the week. Well, anyone who knows what I do, it's just been non-stop work for this whole week

22:22.660 --> 22:27.260
So many things getting ready to ship out, you know for this Christmas season

22:27.620 --> 22:32.100
So, you know, I heard a rumor you work for some game company. Yeah who to thunk it

22:32.780 --> 22:40.620
Let's see, but the cool things about that my match to steal myself some good swag during the week got some Silent Hill four posters

22:41.060 --> 22:43.060
so

22:43.640 --> 22:45.740
No, it was given I asked and I took

22:45.740 --> 22:51.660
took. It's a cool thing to go into their boiler room and see all the promo stuff from every

22:51.660 --> 22:56.580
game that's ever been made and like posters, boxes, all that. It's pretty neat. And I saw

22:56.580 --> 23:03.760
about 500 extreme vrares. Ooh. Can I visit Konami and borrow things? Well, you do know

23:03.760 --> 23:07.700
me. You know, I mean, my name doesn't have a lot of clout out there. Just don't turn

23:07.700 --> 23:12.980
into a name dropper. You know, that's not bad. I won't. I'm not like a particular pool

23:12.980 --> 23:18.580
ball anyway i'm sorry sorry but yeah the other stuff in the week um actually went to a concert

23:18.580 --> 23:25.700
on friday night went to go see uh kanye west and usher in concert and uh that was it was

23:25.700 --> 23:30.340
a pretty it was a pretty happening event but uh i must say there was it was pretty entertaining

23:30.340 --> 23:36.820
just to see the crowd right on idea what kind of crowd did they have in an usher concert

23:36.820 --> 23:41.940
i'm curious well everything you expect every girl from like 12 to 35 you know just chicks

23:41.940 --> 23:45.180
everywhere. Did Usher take his shirt off at some point during the concert?

23:45.180 --> 23:49.260
Oh, you can tell. You didn't even have to see the stage. You just heard, like, the loudest

23:49.260 --> 23:55.620
screaming you've ever heard. Imagine, like, 20,000 banshees going wild on them. That was

23:55.620 --> 24:00.700
just real. I mean, it's funny to see just how girls react over just one guy on stage.

24:00.700 --> 24:04.740
I mean, one of the funniest stories about that, I mean, I have, like, so many stories

24:04.740 --> 24:08.340
about that concert alone, but probably the funniest one was, there was one scene, one

24:08.340 --> 24:12.540
part like in the middle of the show where he's doing a ballad so normally

24:12.540 --> 24:15.700
what any you know singer does he grabs some like lucky woman off the stage it

24:15.700 --> 24:19.200
he's gonna serenade her so he looks around and he points out this one gal in

24:19.200 --> 24:22.680
the crowd and when you see this gal like the spotlights going on there she's like

24:22.680 --> 24:26.100
totally freaking out she's you know I you just look at her face because they

24:26.100 --> 24:30.600
put the you know camera on the projection screen and I can say from the

24:30.600 --> 24:34.540
time she got picked to the time she got offstage you did not see her smile once

24:34.540 --> 24:37.380
She was too busy totally like freaking out making the sad face like

24:38.420 --> 24:41.020
Like maybe her vagina was but never mind

24:43.540 --> 24:45.540
Doesn't I sure have a song called burn

24:47.500 --> 24:49.500
Yes as a matter of fact

24:49.940 --> 24:55.560
Funny no, but um so like what they do is when the dancers like they spot this girl the dancers escort her out on stage

24:55.560 --> 24:56.820
But she's not on stage yet

24:56.820 --> 25:00.740
They put her on just like velvet couches sort sort when you see her on the couch

25:00.780 --> 25:03.060
She's like absolutely shaking like a leaf just like

25:03.060 --> 25:08.900
And it's funny I'm just seeing her thinking like the imagery of this girl like on a you know velvet bed or whatever shaking

25:08.900 --> 25:11.660
I'm thinking man. I ain't seen that since prom night, man

25:14.620 --> 25:19.180
Seriously, but it's like cuz now you see usher get up on stage, and he's like walking slowly taking his time

25:19.180 --> 25:20.220
He gets up there

25:20.220 --> 25:25.320
You know he's got like a bouquet of flowers for her and you could like when the camera zooms in on her you can see

25:25.320 --> 25:30.060
Her face. She's like mouthing. I love you to her you know to him, which is pretty standard any family do that

25:30.060 --> 25:34.780
yeah I know I would okay and then so finally like just somewhere around the

25:34.780 --> 25:37.620
part where you know you talk about you know I'll get down with you and all that

25:37.620 --> 25:41.300
kind of where you're singing that I swear to God I'll put $20 on this you

25:41.300 --> 25:45.180
could ask Mike no you can ask little B who saw this I swear she mouth the words

25:45.180 --> 25:55.100
I'll let you fuck me I was just like damn I mean there's just some whores in

25:55.100 --> 25:58.380
this world I guess I mean I know if it's an Oscar concert a girl says it to a guy

25:58.380 --> 26:03.240
He's flattered. I don't know if Beyonce pulled me on stage and I pulled that I'd be out in cuffs in like three seconds

26:03.560 --> 26:10.020
So I just found that kind of curious, but overall it was pretty fun. And then um, yeah today it's just been

26:10.540 --> 26:15.500
Coming up from the bay up to SACTO and hanging out with you guys then the funds only just begun. That's right

26:15.500 --> 26:20.400
We always appreciate when you come and hang out because it's always a good excuse to go have Mongolian barbecue as well always

26:20.620 --> 26:25.300
And before I pass the mic just want to say what's up to the chat room, especially up to you Sigurd and Kyle

26:25.300 --> 26:26.300
Word.

26:26.300 --> 26:29.780
Yeah, I was gonna say, Sigurd is getting there, he's very antsy in our chat room because he

26:29.780 --> 26:33.220
thinks you're ignoring him, when in reality, you couldn't see the chat room because we

26:33.220 --> 26:34.300
were playing with a webcam.

26:34.300 --> 26:38.020
So the chat room was down for a little bit, but he's like, Mel doesn't love me, meh meh

26:38.020 --> 26:39.020
meh, my vagina's pretty heavy.

26:39.020 --> 26:41.020
I got mad loves for you.

26:41.020 --> 26:47.560
And even though my new office mate is still psycho, I still hold a little place in my

26:47.560 --> 26:48.560
heart for you.

26:48.560 --> 26:52.580
And I still have a Silent Hill 4 poster if you come back, if I gotta bribe you, I'll

26:52.580 --> 26:53.580
bribe you, man.

26:53.580 --> 26:55.580
How's your tip jar doing?

26:55.580 --> 26:57.580
Uh, we are over thirty dollars.

26:57.580 --> 26:59.580
Where the hell's all this money coming from?

26:59.580 --> 27:05.580
Okay, well, I explained it a little earlier in the DDR Freakboards, but the short of it was essentially

27:05.580 --> 27:13.580
Me and Sigurd, we used to have a bunch of stuff in our cube, like, if you saw the first montage we ever did, we had, like, red vines, we had, like, granola bars and all that stuff

27:13.580 --> 27:14.580
And so our boss came-

27:14.580 --> 27:15.580
The clue? Clue?

27:15.580 --> 27:17.580
Yeah, clues, quote.

27:17.580 --> 27:25.580
Did you, I actually, I wanted to ask you real fast, fast, did you want to issue like a formal apology to the users of DDR Freak for what you did?

27:25.580 --> 27:32.580
I will say this, you guys totally assumed it was a clue, I only said which of these would you like to have right about now.

27:32.580 --> 27:38.580
I didn't mean to lead you on, you led yourselves, as your own damn fault.

27:38.580 --> 27:40.580
I was gonna tell you not to apologize, but.

27:40.580 --> 27:42.580
Yeah, as your own damn fault.

27:42.580 --> 27:45.580
I tried to say about the inkblot thing, but nobody listens to Scott.

27:45.580 --> 27:49.580
I know, man. You're the third eye of, you know, DDR Freakup in this piece.

27:49.580 --> 27:50.580
That's alright.

27:50.580 --> 27:57.580
But, um, oh gosh, where was I at? Yeah, so, the story was, we had a bunch of stuff, and then our boss came in one day on a Friday afternoon.

27:57.580 --> 28:06.580
And saw that we had a bunch of granola bars, and so he just kind of walked up to us, not saying a word, grabbed about three granola bars, dropped a dollar on the table and just walked off.

28:06.580 --> 28:12.580
We were like, what the hell did he just do? And then, you know, we were just thinking for the rest of the day, wow, that was kind of freaky.

28:12.580 --> 28:18.580
And he comes back to us later and tells us, well, he was doing interviews like all day for people, you know, coming to Konami,

28:18.580 --> 28:23.580
and he just didn't have time to go on a lunch break, and so he figured, well, hey, the testers have food.

28:23.580 --> 28:30.580
So he just grabbed some from us and dropped the dollar as, you know, just payment for, you know, well, I don't want to feel like I'm mooching.

28:30.580 --> 28:36.580
And then just people started picking up on it, and then what started out as like $1.82 came into $30.

28:36.580 --> 28:39.580
I know, I single-handedly put $2.50 in that jar.

28:39.580 --> 28:45.580
Yes you did, and Sharks Girl put in her tip as well, and she don't even work there, so just the fact that people are-

28:45.580 --> 28:49.580
What exactly is she tipping? Never mind, never mind.

28:49.580 --> 28:53.580
Hint, it's not a burning you-know-what.

28:53.580 --> 28:58.580
No comment.

28:58.580 --> 29:02.580
But yeah, that is a week in the life of moi.

29:02.580 --> 29:05.580
Alright. Sounds good.

29:05.580 --> 29:06.580
Sharks Girl.

29:06.580 --> 29:07.580
Hi.

29:07.580 --> 29:15.340
Hello, long time no see. Since like, what, a couple weeks ago on the great mini golfing

29:15.340 --> 29:19.420
expedition? Oh, that was beautiful. That was beautiful. The night we weren't allowed to

29:19.420 --> 29:23.680
go to the Konami dinner, we were excommunicated from the dinner, so we had to go miniature

29:23.680 --> 29:26.920
golfing at Miggle. Although I have to say, Mel and I went miniature golfing in Santa

29:26.920 --> 29:31.600
Cruz last week, and I beat him by one. Good job. Pretty freaking proud of myself. Although

29:31.600 --> 29:34.240
So I would like to remind you that I did school you at Miggle.

29:34.240 --> 29:38.040
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever bitch.

29:38.040 --> 29:39.040
Alright.

29:39.040 --> 29:40.680
I was just letting you win.

29:40.680 --> 29:42.320
Oh, oh, I see.

29:42.320 --> 29:43.320
Oh, she let me win.

29:43.320 --> 29:44.320
Did you guys hear that?

29:44.320 --> 29:45.320
She let me win.

29:45.320 --> 29:49.800
Yeah, them's fighting words, huh?

29:49.800 --> 29:50.800
Uh-huh.

29:50.800 --> 29:53.320
Alright, so what else did you do this week?

29:53.320 --> 29:54.320
Anything exciting?

29:54.320 --> 30:01.120
I, I worked, which is more so suited for the FUs of the week, and then I woke up yesterday

30:01.120 --> 30:04.400
thinking I'm going to have a wonderful Saturday and realize I cannot turn my head to the right

30:04.400 --> 30:05.400
or the left.

30:05.400 --> 30:06.400
Oh no.

30:06.400 --> 30:10.680
So, my neck's been kind of sucks-ore and it still hurts, that's why I let Mel drive up

30:10.680 --> 30:11.680
here.

30:11.680 --> 30:15.560
Yeah, I've just been kind of like, hmm, yay, pain.

30:15.560 --> 30:18.360
Back medicines are your friend, although they make me sleep.

30:18.360 --> 30:21.800
So I've just been kind of really out of it, even for me.

30:21.800 --> 30:23.520
Mmm, cry.

30:23.520 --> 30:30.240
So I'll go back to work and I'll have an excuse for being a bitch.

30:30.240 --> 30:33.680
Any shout-outs or anything you want to plug while you're here?

30:33.680 --> 30:37.640
I am now addicted to Mario vs. Donkey Kong.

30:37.640 --> 30:40.240
That was a game I could not get into for some reason, I just...

30:40.240 --> 30:43.360
I just played it for five minutes, I'm like, I must buy this game.

30:43.360 --> 30:45.600
I don't know why, I just didn't...

30:45.600 --> 30:49.600
Mario vs. Donkey Kong.

30:49.600 --> 30:53.400
Oh, she's gonna be the Game Boy again.

30:53.400 --> 30:55.260
Yeah, except Mel just dropped it.

30:55.260 --> 30:56.640
Angel comes prepared.

30:56.640 --> 30:58.360
That's right.

30:58.360 --> 30:59.720
Anything else you want to share?

30:59.720 --> 31:01.900
no i'm boring

31:01.900 --> 31:03.560
no you know you know boring

31:03.560 --> 31:07.040

31:07.040 --> 31:10.120
the most boring man in the world yeah angel

31:10.120 --> 31:13.300
okay i must pull the joke now do you realize you have all three males on the

31:13.300 --> 31:15.140
couch

31:15.140 --> 31:16.920
well that's a good point

31:16.920 --> 31:20.320
yeah but people don't know your real name you just gave it away angel

31:20.320 --> 31:24.040
hey hey hey it's only the first three letters they can guess the rest

31:24.040 --> 31:26.040
no nobody start guessing uh...

31:26.040 --> 31:29.540
let's see uh... yeah i'm mel

31:29.540 --> 31:30.040
No, I'm not.

31:30.040 --> 31:32.660
No, he's float, walk, remember?

31:32.660 --> 31:34.020
Float, walk.

31:34.020 --> 31:35.020
Yeah, see?

31:35.020 --> 31:36.020
Loki, how was your week?

31:36.020 --> 31:38.780
How was your day?

31:38.780 --> 31:43.540
My day would have been better if my shit didn't crap out on me.

31:43.540 --> 31:44.060
Shit crap?

31:44.060 --> 31:47.740
You didn't want my shit crapped.

31:47.740 --> 31:50.220
No, I'm talking very vague.

31:50.220 --> 31:52.460
I mean, I'm talking about the little board

31:52.460 --> 31:54.340
that I had for my cabinet.

31:54.340 --> 31:56.580
Not necessarily a main one, because I

31:56.580 --> 31:58.220
didn't play with that today.

31:58.220 --> 32:03.220
My smaller one that I was using from MAME before, but it's now being used for everything else,

32:03.220 --> 32:06.220
crapped out, and I don't know why.

32:06.220 --> 32:09.220
It might have something to do with my shitty soldering job to fix it.

32:09.220 --> 32:11.220
I mean, that might have something to do with it.

32:11.220 --> 32:13.220
So I have to get a new one. That sucks.

32:13.220 --> 32:16.220
But at least it'll be nice and brand new.

32:16.220 --> 32:20.220
Thing is, I had- well, we did get to play a little bit of DDR today.

32:20.220 --> 32:24.220
I had it set up so we could play, and it was pretty.

32:24.220 --> 32:29.220
And my pads worked really well, but they're loud still, so that sucked.

32:29.220 --> 32:35.220
Then yesterday we went to play Qsar, and that rocked because of course I kicked ass anyways.

32:35.220 --> 32:38.220
I kicked ass without even effort. Without effort.

32:38.220 --> 32:43.220
I was actually spinning around on my ass in the middle of the arena shooting people.

32:43.220 --> 32:46.220
Behind my back, all that kind of cool stuff.

32:46.220 --> 32:47.220
Because I rock.

32:47.220 --> 32:58.220
Anyways, and then, um, I tried playing DDR on doubles and stuff at the arcade, and I realized I have no more, um, endurance anymore. It's just gone.

32:58.220 --> 33:08.220
So, um, yeah, I felt like I was gonna die. And, um, yeah, my feet hurt a lot from all the walking from playing QZR. That kinda sucked, too.

33:08.220 --> 33:17.220
And since the girlfriend and sister aren't here, the thing that I thought was haunted is not haunted. I wasted my money. I'm an idiot.

33:18.220 --> 33:22.220
That's all we need to know. And that sucked.

33:23.220 --> 33:30.220
For those who were listening Wednesday, I bought a haunted doll off the internet, supposedly.

33:32.220 --> 33:36.220
But, you know, whatever, it wasn't. So that sucked. And I hate it.

33:36.220 --> 33:38.220
Ooh, food!

33:39.220 --> 33:41.220
Aww. No food.

33:42.220 --> 33:44.220
And a new guest.

33:44.220 --> 33:46.220
Um, but anyways, yeah, so that was that.

33:46.220 --> 33:48.220
And, uh, for that. But, um...

33:48.220 --> 33:53.220
Oh, and I made a CD. My CD for my remixes and stuff.

33:53.220 --> 33:56.220
And, um, yeah.

33:56.220 --> 33:59.220
That's pretty much all that I did this week, I think.

33:59.220 --> 34:01.220
Oh, and La Final Fantasy.

34:01.220 --> 34:05.220
And Logie will be giving away copies of his CD to some of our in-studio guests tonight.

34:05.220 --> 34:11.500
exciting. Alright. Who else wants to play How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day? Jonas,

34:11.500 --> 34:15.500
hello, thank you for joining us. Hey, what's up y'all? How Was Your Week, How Was Your

34:15.500 --> 34:21.540
Day? Uh, the ups and downs. The ups was the tournament being okay, giving St. Kennedy

34:21.540 --> 34:26.620
a good time. Oh, I completely forgot about that. Yeah! There was that little, there was

34:26.620 --> 34:31.060
a tournament that went on over down at Scandia on Tuesday night here locally. Now, who the

34:31.060 --> 34:35.980
hell holds a DER tournament on a Tuesday I have no idea it's their first time I've

34:35.980 --> 34:39.300
actually talked to them no it's not because we did like two tournaments there

34:39.300 --> 34:44.820
but it's no I mean the actual organizer itself all right whatever but it was

34:44.820 --> 34:49.340
like a back-to-school bash type thing and they were given away a trophy as a

34:49.340 --> 34:53.020
grand prize and I happen to know the guy that won it was actually toady if you

34:53.020 --> 34:57.340
were listening on the urine show he was here for that yeah excuse me

34:57.340 --> 35:00.840
Uh, Mel wanted to share something about the tournament? I mean, float?

35:00.840 --> 35:02.840
I'm just saying, if it was... whatever...

35:02.840 --> 35:07.340
If it was a back-to-school tournament, why wouldn't they give away some cool prizes like some trapper keepers or like...

35:07.340 --> 35:10.340
Yeah! DDR trapper keepers!

35:10.340 --> 35:15.340
If it was a back-to-school tournament, why were they holding it on a school night?

35:15.340 --> 35:21.340
No, no, no, no, the trapper keeper is bad news. I mean, we saw South Park, we know what can happen with trapper keepers.

35:21.340 --> 35:25.340
Maybe they could give away... butterfly binders!

35:25.340 --> 35:34.980
I was actually surprised at the turnout for a Tuesday night, I really was, but a bunch

35:34.980 --> 35:38.380
of people I didn't know, and it was interesting.

35:38.380 --> 35:41.160
Yeah, new faces I didn't even know as well, so.

35:41.160 --> 35:47.060
So was the money raised from this thing to go towards making their marquee look non-ghetto?

35:47.060 --> 35:53.900
Because their marquee is pretty crap, I mean, it looked like, you know, I'm gonna glue stuff

35:53.900 --> 35:57.140
to a piece of wood, and it will be our marquee.

35:57.140 --> 36:00.620
Well, they're using the money to actually build the actual scandia place, like the

36:00.620 --> 36:04.300
paths would be better, the speakers...

36:04.300 --> 36:07.860
Maybe they cannot spend it on more skee-ball machines.

36:07.860 --> 36:11.780
My god, they have like eight skee-ball machines in there in the

36:11.780 --> 36:15.480
shooting gallery. Maybe they can use it to dismantle the damn

36:15.480 --> 36:17.220
shooting gallery.

36:17.220 --> 36:21.940
A shooting gallery is fun to annoy people. Dude, the shooting gallery sucks.

36:21.940 --> 36:28.940
You know, my whole reason for going to Scandia, you know, had, had, you know, DVD drive failure, so...

36:28.940 --> 36:30.940
They're sending it to Reno.

36:30.940 --> 36:32.940
It's gone.

36:32.940 --> 36:33.940
They sent it to Reno.

36:33.940 --> 36:34.940
Damn it!

36:34.940 --> 36:35.940
Damn it!

36:35.940 --> 36:42.940
Alright, so we had the little tournament. I dropped in for about 45 minutes, and I was pissed off because they weren't doing freestyle, and I was going to do an exhibition freestyle.

36:42.940 --> 36:47.940
Dr. Dick was going to come out and do Sexy Planet, but I got denied.

36:47.940 --> 36:54.940
And I had my hoes and everything, and I had my uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh part all figured out.

36:54.940 --> 36:56.940
Denied.

36:56.940 --> 37:01.940
Stupid Scandia. I am a total dance attention whore when it comes to freestyle tournaments.

37:01.940 --> 37:03.940
I can't wait for Spiggle 3, that's all I have to say.

37:03.940 --> 37:07.940
They actually gave me some news towards the skit house that they're gonna do tournaments and stuff for Scandia.

37:07.940 --> 37:10.940
They're thinking about doing it every month.

37:10.940 --> 37:12.940
Yeah, I know, exactly.

37:12.940 --> 37:16.940
The over-saturation's calling.

37:16.940 --> 37:19.440
Anyway, anything else interesting happen to you this week?

37:19.440 --> 37:25.440
I got a lot of contact from someone who has organized like Madden tournaments and various other video game tournaments.

37:25.440 --> 37:27.440
The theme will get into the DDR scene as well.

37:27.440 --> 37:28.940
Oh, okay.

37:28.940 --> 37:31.440
Because you know DDR and Madden so much alike.

37:31.440 --> 37:33.440
Yeah.

37:33.440 --> 37:34.940
No, I'm teasing, but that's cool.

37:34.940 --> 37:40.440
There's a tournament of Madden and Tuesday and Steve's Place Pizza in the marketplace.

37:40.440 --> 37:45.140
There's been kind of an over I mean I'm sorry there's been a lack actually of like really like big

37:45.460 --> 37:48.300
Tournaments lately in the past few months like big tournaments there

37:48.300 --> 37:53.720
Haven't been a whole lot, but I kind of fear that this December is looking to be almost a little oversaturated

37:53.720 --> 37:58.400
I mean I've heard of a lot of different things going on so just just be careful check out the calendar

37:58.920 --> 38:04.640
We all know everybody's everybody that has an eye on DDR freaks tournament forum, so you know just check them out

38:04.640 --> 38:11.640
Well, then you got, cause you got SVGL3, you got B3 part 2, I'm not sure when in the hell that's gonna turn out.

38:11.640 --> 38:16.640
Oh. Okay, or, or FU2 on next year.

38:16.640 --> 38:17.640
FU2!

38:17.640 --> 38:18.640
FU2, buddy!

38:20.640 --> 38:21.640
Alright.

38:21.640 --> 38:23.640
The Sacktown Smackdown, that's the subtitle.

38:23.640 --> 38:29.640
Oh, Jesus. Alright, alright. Anyway, anything else you want to share about your weekend any day?

38:29.640 --> 38:35.400
except someone threw a damn beer bottle at my head

38:35.400 --> 38:36.640
for what?

38:36.640 --> 38:38.640
what'd you do?

38:38.640 --> 38:40.120
what'd you do?

38:40.120 --> 38:45.240
no, I didn't say anything, they thought I split the model

38:45.240 --> 38:50.440
you were waving at somebody? hello! and they threw a beer bottle at you?

38:50.440 --> 38:53.560
oh my gosh, yeah

38:53.560 --> 38:56.720
my god people can be rude

38:56.720 --> 39:01.640
Wait a second, he was driving and someone threw a beer bottle at him.

39:01.640 --> 39:05.920
What's wrong with this picture?

39:05.920 --> 39:08.260
I was like, woohoo!

39:08.260 --> 39:12.680
Oh shit!

39:12.680 --> 39:17.040
You lead a very interesting life, explicit, that's all I have to say.

39:17.040 --> 39:20.600
Alright. Well, somewhat, yeah. Alright.

39:20.600 --> 39:23.880
Moving on, let's talk about my week and my day, shall we?

39:23.880 --> 39:28.880
My week of my day was pretty good. I had to say I had a lot of fun at the Qsar thing last night.

39:28.880 --> 39:33.880
Matt and I actually played on the same team for one game, and I was the top gun, thank you very much.

39:33.880 --> 39:38.880
Now, of course, he was spinning around and just blindly shooting things and fucking around, but hey, doesn't matter.

39:38.880 --> 39:49.880
And of course, in that game where it was me, Loki's girlfriend, and DDRHolic all playing in one game, versus Loki, he schooled us by like 200 points, but hey, we tried.

39:49.880 --> 39:55.280
Anyway, I had a lot of fun, and I actually played a game of DDR, believe it or not.

39:55.280 --> 39:59.560
I played a game of Extreme, and this was my set on DDR Extreme, okay?

39:59.560 --> 40:07.160
I played I Believe in Miracles, and Make It Better from DDR First Mix, and then I played

40:07.160 --> 40:08.160
another Second Mix song.

40:08.160 --> 40:10.140
I think I played, like, Let's Get Down or something.

40:10.140 --> 40:12.880
I made it an all Second Mix and First Mix night.

40:12.880 --> 40:14.220
It was awesome.

40:14.220 --> 40:19.820
I miss my old DDR mixes, anyway.

40:19.820 --> 40:23.380
Also tonight, I don't know if you caught a glimpse of me on the webcam earlier, but I'm

40:23.380 --> 40:28.300
dressed in all black, because I'm going out to a goth club after the show.

40:28.300 --> 40:29.500
That should be fun.

40:29.500 --> 40:30.500
You goth.

40:30.500 --> 40:33.260
Yes, you know, I'm so gothic.

40:33.260 --> 40:35.260
That's so wrong.

40:35.260 --> 40:39.500
This is pretty much what it's going to sound like at the goth club, you know, like, oh

40:39.500 --> 40:42.980
wow, the lights.

40:42.980 --> 40:49.980
I'm so tragic. I need another clove, cigarettes.

40:56.420 --> 41:00.140
I'm just teasing. I'm just, I'm just hoping that somebody I know is listening to that

41:00.140 --> 41:03.340
so he'll kick my ass when, you know, I go out later. Anyway.

41:03.340 --> 41:07.420
I, I, I didn't... I, I...

41:07.420 --> 41:11.580
Okay. You know where I'm from

41:11.580 --> 41:15.560
And you know that damn near everybody I hung out with was like uber goth, right?

41:16.080 --> 41:20.700
You know, but I never imagined that there would be like a a club

41:20.900 --> 41:28.180
What did you do go around and just be depressed and wave your hands around like you're trying to bat the ghosts away from you

41:28.740 --> 41:32.060
I'm so gothic that when the night comes

41:32.940 --> 41:34.940
So do I

41:35.740 --> 41:39.100
They fucking play industrial and like

41:39.100 --> 41:45.800
was industrial synthpop that kind of stuff it's really good stuff I actually

41:45.800 --> 41:52.160
like the music at that I went once and then I got I was with one of my friends

41:52.160 --> 41:57.320
who's like in this goth stuff and this one guy wanted to take me home and have

41:57.320 --> 42:02.800
sex and he was like and he was dressed up and like like it and some sort of

42:02.800 --> 42:07.520
like I don't know it was just wrong and again I don't know how many times I've

42:07.520 --> 42:12.680
had to apologize for that Loki I'm sorry to do that to you but I just don't if

42:12.680 --> 42:17.360
your life is so tragic why would you dance about it you know what it no in

42:17.360 --> 42:21.280
reality it's actually a lot of fun if if I if I didn't enjoy it I wouldn't pay a

42:21.280 --> 42:24.800
whole four dollars to get in the door so I'm looking forward to it because I

42:24.800 --> 42:28.440
actually haven't been in like two years and there's a lot of fun people to go

42:28.440 --> 42:34.960
it's all about the people all right um moving on we're gonna go to a break but

42:34.960 --> 42:39.640
I wanted to talk to you guys about something before we go to the break. I

42:39.640 --> 42:43.480
think Floatwalk wants to talk to you guys about something too. About a little

42:43.480 --> 42:46.280
something, a little bit that's been confusing to some of you guys out there.

42:46.280 --> 42:55.240
Can we get Floatwalk a mic? Now those of you guys that visit DDR Freak have seen this

42:55.240 --> 42:59.560
picture of a of a bagel and you don't know what it means. It means something

42:59.560 --> 43:02.200
but you don't know what it means. Well we're gonna give you a little bit of

43:02.200 --> 43:11.760
help. And Floatwalk has gotten a clue relayed to him from Dancer X, the mysterious Dancer

43:11.760 --> 43:16.920
X, but you know, Floatwalk talks to him, so you're special. And so we've gotten some things

43:16.920 --> 43:21.760
here, so maybe just these first two bits here we'll give away for right now.

43:21.760 --> 43:27.640
Okay, well it's pretty obvious so far no one has answered the question correct yet, although

43:27.640 --> 43:31.920
I will say, I have seen some very close answers on there.

43:31.920 --> 43:36.320
And as I mentioned before, a lot of people are trying to, I

43:36.320 --> 43:39.120
guess, sort of think that the song is three steps away from

43:39.120 --> 43:40.400
what you literally see.

43:40.400 --> 43:41.680
Well, it's actually right there.

43:41.680 --> 43:43.920
It's a little more literal than you think.

43:43.920 --> 43:50.480
But also, if you read DancerX's post, he said in

43:50.480 --> 43:52.440
there that it is a new song.

43:52.440 --> 43:55.120
It's something that has never been on DDR before.

43:55.120 --> 43:58.880
so that should narrow down some of the ideas that you had

43:58.880 --> 44:03.320
and do you think we should go ahead and give him the new clue yet?

44:03.320 --> 44:06.440
let's wait a little bit let's see if that new song thing helps him out a little bit

44:06.440 --> 44:11.120
so it's a brand new song and you guys it was actually in his original post

44:11.120 --> 44:14.680
it was like the subject line and you guys completely missed it but hey you know

44:14.680 --> 44:17.760
what can you do we can only hold your hand so far

44:17.760 --> 44:22.520
but if you have some guesses we'll be fielding guesses over private message a

44:22.520 --> 44:23.120
little later

44:23.120 --> 44:25.680
Don't just shout it out in the chat room, because we're not paying attention.

44:25.680 --> 44:29.000
No, actually, we are paying attention, but we don't want to miss it.

44:29.000 --> 44:31.480
So that's why we like to field the guesses over a private message.

44:31.480 --> 44:35.600
So after the break, we'll take some more guesses and have a look.

44:35.600 --> 44:39.520
And I'll even put it like this, if someone can guess it just from the clues that I've

44:39.520 --> 44:44.320
given you, if you somehow pull it out, I will guarantee you some cool Konami swag.

44:44.320 --> 44:45.320
Ooh, swag!

44:45.320 --> 44:46.320
Speaking of swag.

44:46.320 --> 44:47.320
Can I guess?

44:47.320 --> 44:52.200
Oh, we have a huge announcement on swag coming up for Orange Lounge later.

44:52.200 --> 44:54.520
You will not want to miss this one.

44:54.520 --> 44:56.800
Floatwalk's going to talk to us about this.

44:56.800 --> 44:58.880
This is very exciting news for Orange Lounge Radio.

44:58.880 --> 45:01.320
Floatwalk's going to tell us all about it right after the break.

45:01.320 --> 45:03.400
And in this break, we're going to have three songs

45:03.400 --> 45:04.840
that all have a central theme.

45:04.840 --> 45:06.200
You try and figure out what it is.

45:06.200 --> 45:06.680
We'll be back.

45:06.680 --> 45:32.740
I'm gonna show you how to burn

45:32.740 --> 45:34.740
show you how to burn

46:02.740 --> 46:11.740
It's time to burn

46:11.740 --> 46:14.740
Burn, burn, burn, you burn me

46:14.740 --> 46:16.740
Your mind is talking so loud

46:16.740 --> 46:18.740
You burn me

46:18.740 --> 46:20.740
There's an expectation

46:20.740 --> 46:22.740
Our bodies are flashing inside

46:22.740 --> 46:24.740
I'm on fire

46:24.740 --> 46:26.740
Burn, burn, burn, you're fired

46:26.740 --> 46:28.740
Can't I thank you more?

46:28.740 --> 46:32.740
Don't shoot me, I'll fire you with me crazy

46:32.740 --> 46:37.740
I'm down to find the force, find the force, find the force

47:02.740 --> 47:14.180
Like a greedy man, I'm comin' back to you It's time to play my game, I can't do without

47:14.180 --> 47:18.180

47:18.180 --> 47:24.180
I'm gonna take your love, cause I need it Let me be your man, let me kiss you

47:24.180 --> 47:28.180
Yeah, I need to touch you, but it's gonna be alright

47:28.180 --> 47:34.180
Maybe I wanna get your love, to make love now

47:34.180 --> 47:39.180
I wanna be close to you, I wanna see your body move

47:39.180 --> 47:43.180
So take a rest, and make it hot tonight

47:43.180 --> 47:46.180
Like a bum bum bustin' out

47:46.180 --> 47:49.180
It's a burning desire

47:49.180 --> 47:52.180
Fighting me seeks my heart and my soul

47:52.180 --> 47:53.180
Whoa whoa

47:53.180 --> 47:55.180
Cause you're just like a fire

47:55.180 --> 47:59.180
I'm going out of control

47:59.180 --> 48:01.180
And it drives me crazy

48:01.180 --> 48:03.180
It's that burning desire

48:03.180 --> 48:07.180
Riding me seeks my heart and soul

48:07.180 --> 48:08.180
Woah woah

48:08.180 --> 48:10.180
Cause you're dressed like a fire

48:10.180 --> 48:13.180
I'm going out

48:13.180 --> 48:16.180
And getting crazy for you

48:16.180 --> 48:18.180
I want you baby

48:46.180 --> 49:12.580
I will pray now and for every day to be with you

49:12.580 --> 49:17.580
To make your sky more than blue

49:17.580 --> 49:19.580
As I'm going my way

49:19.580 --> 49:21.580
Get me up inside

49:21.580 --> 49:24.580
I want something new

49:24.580 --> 49:27.580
I'm trying to get through

49:29.580 --> 49:32.580
I'm burning up for you

49:32.580 --> 49:35.580
I'm burning up for you

49:35.580 --> 49:40.580
I burn every time that I'm close to you

49:41.580 --> 49:44.580
I burn it up for you

49:44.580 --> 49:47.580
I burn it up for you

49:47.580 --> 49:55.580
I never loved anybody the way I do

49:55.580 --> 50:13.580
I believe one day we'll find the key to leaving

50:25.580 --> 50:35.780
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

50:35.780 --> 50:38.380
We are back, Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 110.

50:38.380 --> 50:44.220
Okay, we told you before the break that the clue has something to do with a new song,

50:44.220 --> 50:48.940
so here's your chance to give it another guess, send a private message to Sky in the chat

50:48.940 --> 50:50.300
room with your guess.

50:50.300 --> 50:54.720
If you get it right, you get to be the one to announce it, ooh la la, and you could even

50:54.720 --> 51:00.900
do that over the skype line if you have access to that our skype line just go to www.orangelaungeradio.com

51:00.900 --> 51:04.960
click on interact with us and get the information about the skype line so we're looking for

51:04.960 --> 51:14.780
your guesses meanwhile before we went to the break float walk and i were teasing a little

51:14.780 --> 51:18.960
something that's coming up for orange lounge radio and float walk why don't you tell us

51:18.960 --> 51:22.280
a little more about what's going on i thought we had a third mic somewhere we can get for

51:22.280 --> 51:32.240
Jamie maybe maybe not I don't know anyway the giveaway that's coming up oh

51:32.240 --> 51:37.200
yes yes well okay um as I've seen in our challenge I know there are a couple

51:37.200 --> 51:43.320
people that we hold in high regard in this realm of Bemani and such people who

51:43.320 --> 51:47.840
we'd like to sleep with is this list we have no I'm kidding and atop that list

51:47.840 --> 51:51.760
which I think holds true for quite a bunch of people you know figuratively

51:51.760 --> 52:02.760
and conceptually or reality. We do have someone who has decided to donate us some swag, autographed swag, no less.

52:02.760 --> 52:05.760
And that person would be... Drumroll, anyone?

52:05.760 --> 52:06.760
Yeah.

52:08.760 --> 52:13.760
Okay, we got clap on the clapper. But that'll do. And that person is...

52:13.760 --> 52:15.760
Akira Yomoka.

52:15.760 --> 52:26.120
Yes indeed, when DDR Spot did the interview with Kiryamoka a couple of weeks ago when

52:26.120 --> 52:31.320
we posted it on DDR Spot, he mentioned somewhere in the email that he would be willing to give

52:31.320 --> 52:37.540
out some swag to our listeners and to our readers at DDR Spot and given the business

52:37.540 --> 52:42.720
relations between DDR Spot and Orange Lounge, I figured why not share the wealth with everybody.

52:42.720 --> 52:46.800
So, we do have a handful of CDs to give away.

52:46.800 --> 52:49.360
How we will do that, we are still determining right now,

52:49.360 --> 52:52.240
but you will have to listen to not just Orange Lounge Radio

52:52.240 --> 52:54.760
on Sunday nights, but I think there's a little more

52:54.760 --> 52:56.760
attention you'll have to be paying.

52:56.760 --> 52:58.920
Yes, we're cooking up a scheme right now

52:58.920 --> 53:00.160
on how we're gonna give away the CDs,

53:00.160 --> 53:02.800
but we are very excited to be working with DDR Spot

53:02.800 --> 53:04.680
on this exciting giveaway.

53:04.680 --> 53:07.080
Ooh, I know a lot of people out there want those CDs,

53:07.080 --> 53:08.820
so we're gonna make it tough,

53:08.820 --> 53:10.920
but the prize is gonna be well worth it,

53:10.920 --> 53:12.560
so look forward to that.

53:12.560 --> 53:17.480
some giveaways, a little piece of a Kiryamoka for your bedroom or wherever you decide to

53:17.480 --> 53:18.480
put it.

53:18.480 --> 53:21.520
Yes, and DDR Spot as well will be giving them out.

53:21.520 --> 53:26.120
We're actually going to be redoing our interface in the next couple weeks, so probably expect

53:26.120 --> 53:30.840
by around the end of the month, we'll have a new relaunch, and this time, the reason

53:30.840 --> 53:34.720
why I think we're going to be a little more successful is we actually have more staff

53:34.720 --> 53:37.300
helping us out.

53:37.300 --> 53:38.300
More staff?

53:38.300 --> 53:39.300
Har, har.

53:39.300 --> 53:42.540
Har har. Who'd be sucker enough to help you guys out?

53:43.900 --> 53:49.440
People who like something different. I mean, I'll say this as far as like DDR spot one thing I do

53:50.220 --> 53:54.840
Like to pump up about us is the fact that any kind of Konami news that breaks

53:55.660 --> 53:59.620
About the from the u.s. Side of things. I mean, no one's going to beat us to the punch

54:00.100 --> 54:07.400
How the people who are on spot staff work, you know there is that is that difficult having to have a DDR fan site?

54:07.400 --> 54:15.400
yet at the same time you work for Konami. If you wanted to blow the lid on the whole UltraMix 2 song list and the Extreme Unlocks and all that stuff, you could do it.

54:15.400 --> 54:16.400
Oh yeah, we absolutely could.

54:16.400 --> 54:18.400
I mean, you could get sued, but you could do it.

54:18.400 --> 54:25.400
You could do it, but at the same time, there's, you know, movies that you geek up over. You don't want someone to tell you, like, how it ends. You know, word for word verbatim.

54:25.400 --> 54:29.400
Yeah, you know what? The boat sank, and, uh, Darth is Luke's father. Sorry, guys.

54:29.400 --> 54:34.400
Yeah, essentially. I mean, just working for a while, it's like, I mean...

54:34.400 --> 54:35.400
And Jesus does die.

54:35.400 --> 54:37.400
At the end, they hang Jesus.

54:37.400 --> 54:41.400
Yeah, I mean, I think the best way of putting it...

54:41.400 --> 54:44.400
Wow, Jesus dies and laughter ensued.

54:44.400 --> 54:49.400
Sorry for the spoiler guy, but Jesus does die at the end of that recent DVD release.

54:49.400 --> 54:57.400
Oh yeah, but the thing about, I guess, working there, like, the first day, obviously, you're surprised just as anybody to find out, you know, this news,

54:57.400 --> 55:04.400
but then, once you start playing something for 40 hours a week, the novelty dies out after the 15th hour, so...

55:04.400 --> 55:15.400
But I think we've gotten to the point where it's something, I mean, it's something we've all done before, it's pretty standard nature to understand the nature of the beast, how people are on boards.

55:15.400 --> 55:29.400
I mean, obviously they're going to pester you for a clue here or there, but now that I work closer with the product managers and all the PR people, I kind of know where my limits are, and once those are drawn out, it's easy to hold on to those, stay within those boundaries.

55:29.400 --> 55:36.200
So speaking of limits, any other hints about things we could look forward to?

55:36.200 --> 55:38.960
I'm trying guys, I'm trying to get something out of them.

55:38.960 --> 55:46.120
I will say for UltraMix 2 SP7 will be ready when UltraMix 2 ships.

55:46.120 --> 55:47.120
Right on?

55:47.120 --> 55:53.960
Yeah, well we know it is and there's new stuff on there, so you're not just getting run-of-the-mill

55:53.960 --> 55:56.800
things.

55:56.800 --> 56:00.800
The Xbox Live is going to be pretty awesome. It's going to be more robust this time on

56:00.800 --> 56:04.800
Iron. You've probably heard, obviously, you can trade edits online, you can download

56:04.800 --> 56:05.800
step data.

56:05.800 --> 56:08.240
Awesome. Have they made an official announcement, you don't have to say it one way or the other,

56:08.240 --> 56:11.120
but have they made an official announcement about being able to play those edits? I know

56:11.120 --> 56:15.000
there was a little bit of confusion about being able to play edits.

56:15.000 --> 56:16.800
To, like, challenge someone online with the edits?

56:16.800 --> 56:17.800
Yeah, with playing edits.

56:17.800 --> 56:22.440
Quite honestly, I can't remember. I mean, there's so many things that go into, you know,

56:22.440 --> 56:23.440
like...

56:23.440 --> 56:24.440
All right, all right. It's cool.

56:24.440 --> 56:25.440
It just slips me.

56:25.440 --> 56:26.440
It's cool, it's cool.

56:26.440 --> 56:29.440
I don't want you to say anything that's going to get you in trouble, so don't worry about it.

56:29.440 --> 56:34.440
What else do I expect? A lot of people geeked up over DDR Extreme having a v-rare.

56:34.440 --> 56:41.440
I will say there's a high chance, not 100% sure, but there's a high chance we'll have a v-rare number 4.

56:41.440 --> 56:42.440
Ooh, okay.

56:42.440 --> 56:44.440
You heard that here first.

56:44.440 --> 56:46.440
A v-rare number 4?

56:46.440 --> 56:47.440
Possibly.

56:47.440 --> 56:49.440
How would that... okay, alright.

56:49.440 --> 56:51.440
I think I see where this might be going.

56:51.440 --> 56:54.440
Alright, we'll leave it to our listeners to figure that one out.

56:54.440 --> 56:58.440
Maybe. Maybe.

56:58.440 --> 57:02.440
Other than that, Ultramix 2 is looking snazzy

57:02.440 --> 57:06.440
right now. We're almost ready to send it off to Microsoft

57:06.440 --> 57:10.440
and just let them give us the good word.

57:10.440 --> 57:14.440
Now, I don't know if you can repeat any of this, but you were telling me some funny stories about working on Microsoft

57:14.440 --> 57:18.440
earlier. I don't know if that's something you've got to keep on the down low.

57:18.440 --> 57:22.440
No, actually, it's kind of fascinating. I mean, anyone who works in video games

57:22.440 --> 57:27.880
and does stuff with like Microsoft or Sony, there's actually standards you have to follow.

57:27.880 --> 57:33.400
Like one thing is things on the PlayStation controller for example, you know those little

57:33.400 --> 57:37.240
analog sticks you have on the sides, you know in the front of the controller? They actually,

57:37.240 --> 57:41.320
like any time they're referred to in a game, they actually have to be called right analog

57:41.320 --> 57:45.120
stick or left analog stick, you can't call them anything else, or you can call them L3,

57:45.120 --> 57:50.040
R3. But if you say like, yeah, in the instruction book, use the thumb stick, you would actually

57:50.040 --> 57:54.060
get zinged for it. And what exactly is a zing? Does that mean they come out and kick your

57:54.060 --> 57:58.940
ass or find you? They'll say we're not going to ship your game. Oh my god! There are some

57:58.940 --> 58:02.560
things they'll let slide but there are some things they're pretty strict about and like

58:02.560 --> 58:07.260
just how you name your stuff is actually a big deal. Well not big deal but a semi. Wow.

58:07.260 --> 58:11.420
That's crazy. Yeah. I mean it's when you work in QA and video games there are things you

58:11.420 --> 58:15.980
have to test like you have to make sure your game can run 72 hours without crashing. You

58:15.980 --> 58:18.900
know? Oh my gosh. There are things you have to do like you have to pull the controller.

58:18.900 --> 58:22.900
How did Driver 3 get through QA? That's what I want to know.

58:22.900 --> 58:25.900
Yeah, you didn't go through Konami. That's for damn sure.

58:25.900 --> 58:32.900
But yeah, it's an interesting beast. A lot of people think when you're in QA you have to play games.

58:32.900 --> 58:37.900
You know, you just played Ad Nauseam, but you're supposed to sit there and you're supposed to break what you can.

58:37.900 --> 58:43.900
So anyone who's trying to get into the game industry, you gotta learn how to break games. Not how to play them, break them.

58:43.900 --> 58:49.180
break them. Wow, that's good. Yeah, Loki's very good at breaking games, I must say.

58:49.180 --> 58:54.860
And I broke Ultramix last night. I don't know, I was telling you this earlier, I actually broke Ultramix, so

58:54.860 --> 58:58.460
something got through the cracks somehow, I don't know, but. Well, Ultramix

58:58.460 --> 59:02.420
was a half-rush job, but I mean,

59:02.420 --> 59:08.420
like any other game in the series, the first will always have flaws, which is why you come out with the sequel to correct.

59:08.420 --> 59:12.340
And it wasn't, it honestly wasn't a big deal. I found it more amusing than anything else.

59:12.340 --> 59:13.620
It didn't piss me off or anything.

59:13.620 --> 59:16.660
Besides, flaws in Microsoft products is nothing new.

59:16.660 --> 59:20.060
Hahahaha.

59:20.060 --> 59:25.180
Service pack 2, anybody?

59:25.180 --> 59:29.540
What else? Yeah, I mean, most people know that a lot of the

59:29.540 --> 59:35.160
step data for new songs has been done by Konami QA. I think people who...

59:35.160 --> 59:38.960
there's, you know, usually two people, people who like fun songs and people who like challenging songs,

59:38.960 --> 59:41.620
I think they're going to get a good variety of both.

59:41.620 --> 59:46.500
I'm very excited about Ultramix too. But something we haven't talked a whole lot about, DR Extreme,

59:46.500 --> 59:51.540
it's just about out, it's almost there. I gotta say, because we were talking about this last week,

59:51.540 --> 59:55.460
we were kind of like talking about the whole GameStop leaking the song list, some of the song

59:55.460 --> 59:59.700
list unlocks early and stuff, we were like, boy, Konami must be really pissed off at what happened.

01:00:00.420 --> 01:00:04.820
Was there a little bit of frustration from the clue givers and things like that about the GameStop

01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:09.220
article, or? Kind of sort of, yeah, actually. I mean, you know, I was talking to- I'm sorry,

01:00:09.220 --> 01:00:11.620
I'm sorry, not GameStop, GamePro. My bad. My bad.

01:00:11.620 --> 01:00:17.220
Um, yeah, um, Jason Needles was actually kind of, uh, I would say mad, but he was definitely surprised that

01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:23.620
they would just blow out a whole bunch of, uh, screen caps that more or less gave away a lot of the secrets.

01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:28.220
And I don't think necessarily it was intentional, it was just kind of like, somebody just wasn't thinking.

01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:32.620
They were just grabbing screenshots and not thinking about, oh, maybe somebody's trying to keep the unlocked stuff a secret.

01:00:32.620 --> 01:00:39.120
Yeah, well, I mean, I actually saw, like, what a press kit, you know, there's, essentially there are different types of versions.

01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:42.340
you get of a game, like for example, they got what's called a media version, kind of

01:00:42.340 --> 01:00:46.300
like when a place that, you know, has movies, they get screeners and all that kind of stuff.

01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:47.300
Right.

01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:48.300
I don't know anything about that.

01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:49.300
Yeah, well, he doesn't know anything about screeners.

01:00:49.300 --> 01:00:52.600
So essentially, what that happened was, when you get this screener, you get practically

01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:57.660
most of everything unlocked already, so they can just kind of review the whole game because,

01:00:57.660 --> 01:01:01.780
I mean, there are some, when you get a game review or something, you kind of want to know

01:01:01.780 --> 01:01:04.940
how it ends and all that stuff, so you could say, yeah, this game is great, but man, the

01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:05.940
ending sucked.

01:01:05.940 --> 01:01:09.100
You know, I mean, they may not tell you explicitly what happens, but, you know, they didn't want

01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:12.140
want to kind of play through it and you know so they can formulate a great

01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:16.300
opinion. Now I would think stuff like You're Not Here and Maximizer and stuff

01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:18.860
you guys are really trying probably trying to keep under under the lid a

01:01:18.860 --> 01:01:22.220
little bit and then it just kind of got blown out I mean You're Not Here was a

01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:26.860
little bit spoiled by the dancing stage fever song or I mean fusion

01:01:26.860 --> 01:01:31.300
song list so it was kind of like you know man there's a good chance that

01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:34.060
people were kind of thinking okay yeah that probably would be an unlock but

01:01:34.060 --> 01:01:40.560
Maximizer that was even though you can go back to the whole reading the master

01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:44.400
song list thing and Maximizer had turned up there before this is really the

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:48.560
concrete confirmation people were looking for and yes there is on there

01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:56.720
it's basically to put it it's America's own version of max I don't know whether

01:01:56.720 --> 01:02:01.160
it be excited or scared no I actually I mean a lot of people look at that they

01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:04.460
say oh it's an eight-footer gosh you know that's like a big letdown but I

01:02:04.460 --> 01:02:09.160
there was a guy who know Pacquiao and Kenobi who's you know pretty well known

01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:12.800
in the DDR community you know on DDR freak and he was not able to full combo

01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:19.080
that I I have to say I am actually glad it's not a 10-footer because honestly I

01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:22.400
can't play 10 footers at home I can mean I can barely blame the arcade as it is

01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:26.600
but the home versions aren't meant to be 10 footers yeah exactly I mean I just

01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:30.600
You're playing on those freaking ignition pads, you know?

01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:34.600
Yeah, that's true. But I will say, Maximizer really sounds cool.

01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:38.600
I think of the Maxes, I actually like the way that sounds the best.

01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:42.600
As like Dancer X talked about, it's sort of like

01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:46.600
has a very, very gabba sound to it.

01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:48.600
Gabba, gabba, gabba, gabba, gabba. Yeah.

01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:50.600
Alright. Very interesting. Alright.

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:29.440
We will, we here at Orange

01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:54.600
will play that song for you as soon as we can.

01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:57.460
We have to, you know, probably rip it from the game first, but as soon as we can we will

01:02:57.460 --> 01:02:59.720
get it for you guys so you guys can hear it.

01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:02.820
As well as any other surprises that are still in store.

01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:05.900
Are there still surprises in store for DDR Extreme?

01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:06.900
Absolutely.

01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:07.900
Alright.

01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:09.620
We'll leave it on that note.

01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:10.620
I'm looking for it.

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:11.620
I am looking...

01:03:11.620 --> 01:03:12.620
It is not a clue.

01:03:12.620 --> 01:03:17.060
Yeah, absolutely is not a clue.

01:03:17.060 --> 01:03:19.060
Oh my God.

01:03:19.060 --> 01:03:24.140
Wow, so, gosh, I'm out of questions for Mel.

01:03:24.140 --> 01:03:28.140
Does anybody else have anything to say about this whole extreme and Ultimix 2 we've been talking about?

01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:30.140
Loki, Dark Sakura?

01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:32.140
It's your show too, dammit.

01:03:32.140 --> 01:03:34.140
Oh, Lanky Style's here with Rice Princess.

01:03:34.140 --> 01:03:37.140
Yeah, I just want to know, Mel B., how do you stay so sexy?

01:03:37.140 --> 01:03:39.140
Easy for me.

01:03:39.140 --> 01:03:41.140
Bloat walk, not Mel B.

01:03:41.140 --> 01:03:47.140
I'd say do about 50 push-ups a day and one pack of pork rinds.

01:03:49.140 --> 01:03:50.140
Awesome.

01:03:50.140 --> 01:04:01.140
I guess I'll open up the Skypline in a little bit for those folks that may have a question or something about UltraMix 2 or DDR Extreme. I swear I'll hang up on you if it's something else.

01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:05.140
So let's see, we'll go to the Skypline and see if anybody has anything they want to say.

01:04:05.140 --> 01:04:11.140
Oh, I just missed that call, my bad. We'll see if anybody calls back. Over on the Skypline.

01:04:11.140 --> 01:04:15.140
Ah, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

01:04:15.140 --> 01:04:17.140
Hello?

01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:19.140
Hello?

01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:23.140
We can not hear you. Can you turn up your microphone volume or something?

01:04:23.140 --> 01:04:26.140
Is this better?

01:04:26.140 --> 01:04:27.140
A little bit.

01:04:27.140 --> 01:04:28.140
Is this better now?

01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:30.140
A little bit. How you doing?

01:04:30.140 --> 01:04:35.140
Alright, I missed all the UltraMix II things. Can you fill me in?

01:04:35.140 --> 01:04:39.140
You missed everything on UltraMix II?

01:04:39.140 --> 01:04:45.140
Well, I only managed to pick up the other half, but I just came in and...

01:04:45.140 --> 01:04:48.140
Shame on you for being tardy to the show.

01:04:48.140 --> 01:04:53.480
on you you had to clean your you could clean your room while listening to the

01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:59.240
show I don't buy that excuse all right all right it's gonna be on a disc

01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:05.000
ultramix to Xbox the Xbox live portion is gonna be bigger there's a clue still

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:09.800
involving the bagel out there and if it's for a new song and ultramix 2 is

01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:15.080
gonna have a variety of different kinds of music and what else folks that are

01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:18.880
into DDR are doing the steps we know that much and there's going to be a mix

01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:20.440
of challenging versus fun

01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:23.720
and who are these people they're actually doing

01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:26.880
are these people well-known? can we

01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:29.800
give any more information about the people doing the steps I guess not

01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:30.280
really

01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:34.280
can we give names? I don't think we can give names

01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:37.720
I can't necessarily name drop I mean I'm sure it wouldn't make a hell of a difference but that said

01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:41.880
the people who are in QA are actually... wait we can't hear you exactly let Mel finish

01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:48.880
They are accomplished GDR players, there are people who have won tournaments, there are people who not only PA'd, there are people who freestyle.

01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:57.880
So they take into account like, you know, for basic steps for example, you often want steps that are pretty easy and like freestylable, so we take that into account.

01:05:57.880 --> 01:06:06.880
We take into account that, you know, for maniac steps, there are people who are total difficulty whores, and you know, we do stuff that is ergonomically doable.

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:12.960
I mean, we're not going to do something that's like we strive for 11 feet, you know, because there's such thing

01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:16.720
You need to have as like game balancing and such. So it's you know, we're like that

01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:21.540
We're trying to find moderation, you know balance in other words in other words that goo just go pre-order it tomorrow

01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:23.800
Word but yeah one more thing

01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:29.480
Okay, only focused on one half of the country or is it all you know all over for these players?

01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:35.320
The certain players is it only one part of the country in other words are all these players coming from NorCal

01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:45.320
Well, let's put it like this. It's based in Redwood City, so it's not like we just sat out there and we had this big audition.

01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:51.320
Anyone could apply to Konami, but they had to go through the whole interview process.

01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:54.320
They had to go through people like me who have worked there for a year.

01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:59.320
I have to gauge their acumen on how well they play the game, what they think makes the game well.

01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:02.320
I mean, yeah, most of us are based in Northern California.

01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:04.320
But not 100%?

01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:09.280
no not hurt there are some people who have been imported so uh...

01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:11.360
it's it's not as uh... all

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:15.120
concentric imported from different places that's all we can tell you but

01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:16.840
all right how about this

01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:19.920
anything anything new about that anything that we know about the song list

01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:23.000
is already up on the site we don't have any new info tonight though

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.960
not yet we may have one more song for the night's over

01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:27.200
it's up to you guys

01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:29.040
are the song packs going to be better

01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:31.600
are the song packs going to be better

01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:37.600
That's an opinion. Like I mentioned about SP7, there is new stuff on there.

01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:39.600
I'll answer it, yes.

01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:43.600
Wait, the new stuff for Ultramix is coming out already?

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:47.600
Service Pack 7 will be out the day that Ultramix 2 is out.

01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:51.600
And which one, do we have the names of the songs yet?

01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:54.600
Not yet. Not yet bud, we'll have them soon.

01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:58.600
Alright, thanks for your questions. It was engaging and fun.

01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:00.600
Bye bye.

01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:07.060
Alright, let's see if anybody else wants to call in questions about Ultramix 2 or DDR extreme in the meantime

01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:11.560
Let's go let's go over some of these clues

01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:14.680
We got some people that guessed some of the songs that were in the game

01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:17.300
And now we're gonna let you know if anybody was right

01:08:18.300 --> 01:08:24.360
So, let's see. We had Seagurd put in a guess, but unfortunately, he's not allowed to participate because he was right

01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:30.360
But I will say Sigurd was right on his guess. Good for him.

01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:32.360
He better be right, man.

01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:38.360
Jazz said the sweetest thing by some band whose name I have no idea. I'm thinking maybe U2?

01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:40.360
Now he's thinking too abstract.

01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:43.360
No. That was a decent guess, though. That was decent.

01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:50.360
I think that's the one thing I like about this whole thread thing, is you really get to see how people think.

01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:58.080
You know, it's like, they'll come up with the strangest word associations, and like, they'll try to go three steps, because this, this, and this, I think it's this song.

01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:01.680
I mean, it makes for great reading material and sure kills time at work.

01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:07.680
Alright, uh, White Rob has a guess. Pam Baker and the Blue Plate Special, with Bacon the Blues.

01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:10.400
Very interesting.

01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:14.200
Very- he says, the plate was blue, and the bagel is baked.

01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:18.440
You can't get more obvious than that. But unfortunately it's not it.

01:09:18.440 --> 01:09:20.000
Yeah. No dice.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Bummer.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:27.000
E.B. Sumaru says, John Desire with Hot Limit.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Maybe because the bagel's hot? I don't know.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:34.000
But, nah, I don't know.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Sorry bud, doesn't work.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:42.000
Alright, so those are the guesses we got so far, so we'll just have to see if anything else comes in later.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Mel was talking about a V-Rare that is coming out for DDR Extreme, and that song list was leaked to the internet this week.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:52.000
It sounds like some retailers are getting their copies.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:55.000
There was a scan of the back cover and everything.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.000
It's out there now, so we gotta tell you what's on it.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Well, damn.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Here's another one of those things where they beat you to it, didn't they?

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
There's only so much you can do.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:10.000
We held up our end of the bargain.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
We can't handle what the retailers do.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
That's right. Yeah, the retailers leaked it.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.000
People like the VRare list, and you know, hey, all is good in the end.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:25.000
Track number one is Scorching Moon by Sean the Horny Master, which did not get censored. People thought it would be censored to just the master or...

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Well, what's the censor? The dude plays horns.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Exactly.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:37.000
I mean, not anymore, you know. I still have like a little sadness in my heart for the fact show T's no longer in Konami.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:46.560
number two a by DJ amuro is the second track on the CD track number three is

01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:52.120
ecstasy by D complex track number four is your rain the rage mix yay kiri almoca

01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:55.600
featuring Mary Elizabeth McGlynn the track we premiered for you last month

01:10:55.600 --> 01:11:01.080
wild rush factor X is track number five track number six is the departed show T

01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:05.440
with a stupid barber a track seven mobile mocha by our favorite orange

01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:11.840
track number eight jet world by Mutsukiko Izumi I'm white and track nine

01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:18.960
three two one stars by DJ Simon track 10 V for extreme by DJ Taka and here are

01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:24.440
the bonus tracks eleven is I need you the inside door three mixes never heard

01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:29.320
of that one before um actually that was uh yeah party collection of you rare

01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:33.320
also I don't know actually door one of the viewers that came on Japan had yeah

01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:39.320
Yeah, it's like, it has all three mixes, like, all kind of fused together, just fused up with the Inside Out and All That, I think.

01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:43.320
No, it's just the Inside Out and All That mix, they have the three or...

01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:44.320
Oh, okay.

01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:53.320
Also on the Party Collection OST.

01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:59.080
Party Collection OST? I didn't know that. 13 is B4U Glorious Style. That would be the

01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:04.240
long version from DER 5th Mix. You guys trying to hint at something there? Maybe? Maybe.

01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:14.000
Maybe not. Track 14 is So In Love, the train version by Caramel S and the Master. And track

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:21.560
number 15 is I Need You, the True Platinum Mix by ShowTee. And that's the V-Rare. Actually,

01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:25.300
While it's still on my mind, one thing I'd like to point out also for anyone who's a

01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:30.200
fan of Konami artists and like the Bimani musicians, one of the games that's coming

01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:36.860
out this fall, Rumble Roses for PS2, the all-female wrestling game, you know, high, best things

01:12:36.860 --> 01:12:38.880
ever made.

01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:46.320
A lot of the Bimani musicians did compose music for that, like DJ Taka did a track there,

01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:51.480
which was called Sota Fujimori did stuff there, yeah, let's see, who else?

01:12:51.480 --> 01:13:00.680
The guy who did Jet World, he did something, Dez Road did a track on there, so yeah, it's

01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:04.680
actually funny enough, they were called, they were commissioned somewhere at the last minute

01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:08.560
to do music for the game, and from what I've heard, it sounds pretty cool.

01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:10.800
Nice, I can't wait to see it.

01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:14.480
So definitely, if you're a Bomani music fan, you're going to have to pick up Rumble Roses.

01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:17.360
But of course, as soon as we can get our hands on a soundtrack, we'll play some tracks for

01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:18.360
you.

01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:21.320
Kuriyamaoka did tracks on there as well.

01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:24.040
Gosh, thank you, Sigurd.

01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:25.040
Awesome.

01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:26.040
Alright.

01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:33.680
The other night, a bunch of us were at Lions, and it was like a dance GameStop people, and

01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:38.440
they were there discussing on how they were looking forward to the realistic physics engine

01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:46.920
of Rumble Roses, and the invigorating mud effects, and it was a funny conversation that

01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:51.320
it was yeah talking about how they were going to admire the aesthetic qualities

01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:54.400
of rumble roses and and yeah we did we did talk about this a couple weeks ago

01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:57.120
chat room but I didn't know about the desero thing there was there's more

01:13:57.120 --> 01:14:00.320
artists in there than we originally thought I knew Akira and I knew some of

01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:03.040
them but I didn't know like desero there's way more people than I thought

01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:07.840
that's pretty cool any chance we might see some rumble roses songs on DER

01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:14.920
complete with some new characters as I do my little bounce thing all right

01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:19.840
question from explicit here in the house how many polygons are in each breast and

01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:29.640
rubber roses more than a handful on that note on that note I think we'll go to a

01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:35.280
break and to make up for float walks grotesque error earlier we will be

01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:40.200
playing an entire block of a kyriamoka music all right including some requests

01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:43.800
we had some requests so uh we will go to this what you know what do you want to

01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:47.800
Should we do that other clue? Should we do the other clue, Floatwok?

01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:48.800
Um, why not, sir?

01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:51.800
Why not? Hell, Floatwok, let's give him another chance.

01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:55.800
Let's give him another chance, Floatwok.

01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:57.800
While we have to pull up Dancer X's clue over here.

01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:00.800
I've got Dancer X's clue right up here.

01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:02.800
Really? Let me peek.

01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:10.800
Okay, clue, colon, a unique aspect of a type of cells in the body.

01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:17.300
Hmm. Hmm. A unique aspect of a type of cells in the body.

01:15:17.300 --> 01:15:26.100
So, uh, those of you who took physiology in high school, time to dust off your books and your brains and you just might find something.

01:15:26.100 --> 01:15:33.100
have fun boys and girls will be back

01:15:56.100 --> 01:16:10.100
I cry out of my head And I don't know what I've found

01:16:10.100 --> 01:16:20.100
Over and over I feel it break me down

01:16:20.100 --> 01:16:30.100
I'm waiting for a gentle rain, a gentle rain, a gentle rain

01:16:30.100 --> 01:16:35.100
On the sidewalk of the city, on the streets just for a whisper

01:16:35.100 --> 01:16:40.100
Busy people going nowhere, see me soaking my rain

01:16:40.100 --> 01:16:45.100
Nothing for passion, nothing matters, my resistance is waning

01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:54.100
Like a flower in the basement, waitin' for a long time

01:19:24.100 --> 01:19:29.100
Your gun is on me

01:19:29.100 --> 01:19:34.100
I'm not the one that's on me

01:19:36.100 --> 01:19:42.100
You are too deep and dry

01:19:42.100 --> 01:19:48.100
I'm not the one that's on me

01:20:48.100 --> 01:21:02.540
Orange Lounge Radio.

01:21:02.540 --> 01:21:09.940
We put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.

01:21:09.940 --> 01:21:10.940
We are back.

01:21:10.940 --> 01:21:16.600
Orange Lounge Radio Season 5 has just started and in case you missed it, a unique aspect

01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:22.100
of a type of cells in the body. It's time to guess one more time. Send it in over private

01:21:22.100 --> 01:21:29.980
message to Sky in the chat room if you have a guess. All right, moving on. I thought we'd

01:21:29.980 --> 01:21:34.080
talk about other stuff. Let's see. Oh, by the way, there's drinking going on in the

01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:37.440
house tonight. It is the three-day weekend, which is traditionally an Orange Challenge

01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:42.680
Radio Drunk show. However, DarkSakura, you can't participate tonight because you drove,

01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:18.760
ice cream booze. Oh my god. I've actually sort of, I had this creme brulee

01:22:18.760 --> 01:22:25.720
liqueur that was really good. So I decided how to cheat. I decided that

01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:28.680
tomorrow is going to be my cheat day. So when it hits midnight I'm having some

01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:32.120
Guinness at home. There you go. That's the spirit. I'm gonna finish off the Guinness

01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:37.200
in my fridge and have some amaretto. All right. Any special plans for Labor Day?

01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:43.560
sleeping. Sounds good to me. Actually you know I'm like I'm gonna do my homework

01:22:43.560 --> 01:22:47.200
tomorrow I'm going over to Julie's where there's air conditioning, air conditioning

01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:52.880
Wow and I'm gonna do my laundry cuz see look what I did not bring over tonight

01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:57.600
laundry with my laundry. Impressive. So I'm doing my laundry at Julie's tomorrow and

01:22:57.600 --> 01:23:02.560
making use of one of her five computers that she built. Sounds good

01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:11.920
yes Loki no okay no I'm actually working on right now building my own laptop like

01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:16.120
actually it's not really a laptop I'm gonna be putting inside of a case of a

01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:20.640
Dreamcast and be a portable PC with its own LCD monitor which will also double

01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:26.000
as a car PC with its own navigational and GPS system and will be an on-road

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:31.120
computer for our show well you know the Dreamcast uses Windows CE well I'm

01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:33.120
I'm actually gutting it, I'm just using the case.

01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:35.120
Oh, like the Nintendo PC?

01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:46.120
Some like that, but because I'm gonna use, I wanted to use a nano ITX piece, um, you know, a motherboard, but they're not available yet, so I'm gonna have to use a micro ITX board, which is, uh...

01:23:46.120 --> 01:23:49.120
No, why not build one out of a, out of a, uh, PS2?

01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:50.120
Well, because...

01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:52.120
Because you can find plenty of broken PS2s.

01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:59.120
Well, Dreamcast is small, um, I wanted to use a, um, old PS1, because they sell for 30 bucks on the internet.

01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:00.120
I could give you one.

01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:10.720
Well, a PS1, but the board's too big for it. If I had a Nano ITX1, it would fit perfect, but as it is, it's, I don't know, I'm just pricing it, because it's kind of expensive.

01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:13.320
The Nintendo one was built out of laptop parts.

01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:22.520
Yeah, it's, that's one with a laptop hard drive, LCD monitor. I'm actually going to hack a portable PlayStation 1 LCD screen.

01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:25.020
They have a Dreamcast mobile monitor, though.

01:24:25.020 --> 01:24:26.520
I'll have to check that, too, but...

01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:30.520
Um, I think, um, one of the, uh, uh, ones on, um, Licksang.

01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:32.020
Licksang, I'll go check them.

01:24:32.020 --> 01:24:33.520
But anyways, yeah, that's what I'm gonna work on.

01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:35.020
It's gonna be kinda cool, cause I wanna, like,

01:24:35.020 --> 01:24:38.020
I was actually, what I was setting up for was Minimame,

01:24:38.020 --> 01:24:40.020
or, like, Minibomani stuff,

01:24:40.020 --> 01:24:42.020
so, like, making a micro, um,

01:24:42.020 --> 01:24:45.520
turntable Beatmania-type setup for, like, that kind of thing.

01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:48.520
But the only problem is they're not very powerful PCs.

01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:51.520
They've only, they only go up to, like, one gigahertz, and, um,

01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:56.020
cause they're just, you know, they're mic, no, um, fan or anything, but it's awesome.

01:24:56.020 --> 01:25:01.900
They make the like they have like tiny fans now and heat sinks. Yeah. Anyway, that's the project. I'm working on

01:25:02.900 --> 01:25:05.460
So you've given up on communicating with the dead. I

01:25:06.260 --> 01:25:08.260
Have I have my eight and a half pound

01:25:09.460 --> 01:25:11.900
eight and a half pounds of magnet wire in my room and

01:25:12.540 --> 01:25:15.140
I have my germanium on my desk and

01:25:16.500 --> 01:25:17.660
I

01:25:17.660 --> 01:25:22.500
Actually is looking at copper today, but they only have a copper plated

01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:26.500
Um, circuit boards, but that might be good enough just to stick on there.

01:25:26.500 --> 01:25:30.500
You can order copper from, from the science ordering places.

01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:32.500
Well, I just need a copper plate, and it's small.

01:25:32.500 --> 01:25:36.500
Copper plate? Uh, I'll talk to you about that later, I think I know what to do with it.

01:25:36.500 --> 01:25:39.500
Anyways, but yeah, I'm just, I'm looking in the parts for that.

01:25:39.500 --> 01:25:43.500
The only thing is I figured out that the guy's design's physically impossible,

01:25:43.500 --> 01:25:49.500
because if you were to make something that strong in that small space, it would literally melt.

01:25:49.500 --> 01:25:54.060
melt. It would just be gone, so I don't know. This dead would take it over and it'd open

01:25:54.060 --> 01:25:58.300
a portal to hell. No, it wouldn't do that. The only portal it opened would be burning

01:25:58.300 --> 01:26:05.300
down the house, and I just don't... It couldn't... It couldn't maintain, though, the structural

01:26:05.420 --> 01:26:09.940
integrity it needs to keep the portal to hell open, so it'd just burn up from the, you know,

01:26:09.940 --> 01:26:14.980
the... from the Hades. No. But anyways, yeah, I'll do that later. It would be hotter than

01:26:14.980 --> 01:26:18.980
I was pricing it today at RadioShack, but I don't like RadioShack because they're too expensive.

01:26:27.980 --> 01:26:30.980
Okay, anyways. I'm gonna go back to drinking.

01:26:33.980 --> 01:26:35.980
Yes, you learn quickly.

01:26:40.980 --> 01:26:42.980
I don't know, I'm in a sound effects mood today.

01:26:42.980 --> 01:26:48.980
today anyway let's go see if we got any guesses we actually only got one more

01:26:48.980 --> 01:26:53.700
guess it looks like some people they want more time with this clue they want

01:26:53.700 --> 01:26:58.420
more time with the a unique aspect of a type of cells in the body clue I'm

01:26:58.420 --> 01:27:03.920
wondering how it feels to want well we will give another chance for guesses if

01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:07.740
there's still some people want to google it so they're googling away but we do

01:27:07.740 --> 01:27:10.520
have paid attention in school that's all right

01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:13.920
Chaos Dimension suggests a song, and I've never heard of this,

01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:18.040
You Got Beef by Chuck E. Akins and V Unit.

01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:22.400
Rob. Mel saying no, no, no.

01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:26.920
Rob. What? Isn't it nice to want?

01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:30.520
Isn't it nice to say something that Jamie just said?

01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:33.720
Yeah, I just sort of said that.

01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:37.720
Rent! Pay it!

01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:42.440
Anyway, Seegerd got it right on the second guess as well as the first guess.

01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:46.600
Amazingly enough, he sent me another message and he got it right. I was so amazed.

01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:51.800
If you got it right on the second guess, that's kind of like saying he battled himself in a race

01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:56.120
and he came in third place. Beautiful.

01:27:58.040 --> 01:27:59.960
Beautiful. That means his ass came in last.

01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:04.520
Yeah, as somebody says in the chatroom,

01:28:04.520 --> 01:28:09.640
as I recall, you got beef is not a unique aspect of a type of cells in the body.

01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:12.840
Maybe, well, you know, if you... We got the beef cells.

01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:16.240
If you call yourself maybe a beefy built guy, I don't know. Anyway,

01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:21.240
moving on. Where'd Loki go? Did he disappear into the bathroom? Seriously. I want to talk to him.

01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:25.160
Just, like, pay attention in school.

01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:28.680
See, people don't like to be made to think.

01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:32.320
That's alright. It is hard. It is a hard clue.

01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:35.720
They're hard clues. This is why it's taking you so long to get it. Nobody likes to be

01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:36.680
made to think.

01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:41.080
Because nobody thinks anymore. Chat room, prove me wrong.

01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:44.680
Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp. Anyway.

01:28:44.680 --> 01:28:49.960
See what I mean? Moving on. Uh, you guys know about the big

01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:53.520
day of November 18th coming up. 18 November, some

01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:58.520
folks have been referring to it, where we get a whole shitload of new releases from Japan, including

01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:02.880
Poppin' Music 10, and there is a brand new website open for Poppin' Music 10,

01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:06.040
and it doesn't give us a whole lot about the game, but

01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:09.920
it does show us those cute little Kubricks that are coming with a limited edition.

01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:14.160
So cute! Okay, I need to get that, because I need Poppin' Music Kubricks.

01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:17.400
There's some more information in our chat room if you care.

01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:20.760
A link to the website that has more information.

01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:24.380
Also, 8th Style is going to be getting a limited edition with it, and apparently the

01:29:24.380 --> 01:29:26.240
limited edition comes with some kind of

01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:30.440
not what I thought was cool. Not only do you get a little EMU's card, but you also get

01:29:30.440 --> 01:29:35.500
from what I understand, there's going to be a DVD coming with it with videos of all the

01:29:35.500 --> 01:29:37.640
new consumer songs on 8th Style.

01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:41.140
And who knows what those songs are? We haven't heard yet, but hopefully it's

01:29:41.140 --> 01:29:41.760
good stuff.

01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:45.840
I think it will be. We'll soon find out. I was going to add a comment on

01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:51.840
8th Style. Yes. Actually, I got a report from DarkLionXVI this afternoon

01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:55.160
AKA Siggy. Yes. He was saying that the

01:29:55.160 --> 01:29:58.440
limited edition was going to be like retail that like a hundred thirty

01:29:58.440 --> 01:29:59.160
dollars

01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:04.800
you know what I wish he was on Skype right now that column make him tell us

01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:06.080
more information about the game

01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:09.080
nevermind I was gonna say something but no

01:30:09.080 --> 01:30:15.360
we knew who cares I want a style I guess that's true now saying

01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:18.280
who cares what's in it it's a hundred thirty bucks by it

01:30:18.280 --> 01:30:21.320
you know what's the problem just by it

01:30:21.320 --> 01:30:24.320
And how?

01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:29.320
Alright.

01:30:29.320 --> 01:30:34.320
Ziggy's not on Skype right now. I'll try to call him later. Maybe he can give us more information about what's going on with the...

01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:43.320
Because I haven't been paying close enough attention. I'm getting confused enough at all the U.S. news going around that I can't keep track of the Japanese news as well, so...

01:30:43.320 --> 01:30:45.320
Anyway.

01:30:45.320 --> 01:30:48.320
Shall we have ourselves a cage match, boys and girls?

01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:49.320
Let's do it!

01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:57.720
it yay we's gonna have a cage match last week in the orange lounge cage match I

01:30:57.720 --> 01:31:01.400
need a quiet in the studio please there's too much sidebar conversation

01:31:01.400 --> 01:31:08.360
going on we can't hear ourselves thank you last week in the orange lounge radio

01:31:08.360 --> 01:31:14.160
cage match we had bond one that was Jamie's pick with a song called shine

01:31:14.160 --> 01:31:18.040
and what was so special about shine Jamie it used to some of the same

01:31:18.040 --> 01:31:22.480
samples from Afronova yes so it has a little bit of a DDR tie into it so we'll

01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:26.020
hear that but you only get to hear a clip of last week's winner as a reminder

01:31:26.020 --> 01:31:29.660
the way the cage match works we're gonna play three songs for you guys a clip of

01:31:29.660 --> 01:31:34.600

chakra mix. Here's a clip. Enjoy.

01:33:48.980 --> 01:34:08.500
Alright, that was last week's winner.

01:34:08.500 --> 01:34:11.820
That was Bond with Shine, the dub chakra mix.

01:34:11.820 --> 01:34:13.180
That song just makes me happy.

01:34:13.180 --> 01:34:17.420
Will it win for two weeks in a row or will it succumb to one of our challengers tonight?

01:34:17.420 --> 01:34:18.940
Let's find out.

01:34:18.940 --> 01:34:23.660
This challenger tonight is one of my picks, and you know what, I have to admit, ever since

01:34:23.660 --> 01:34:28.340
I heard that Skulk was announced for Ultramix, I've been liking that band Echo Image more

01:34:28.340 --> 01:34:33.160
and more, and not the secret has anything to do with that by, you know, allowing me

01:34:33.160 --> 01:34:37.600
to borrow the CD for a little while, but honestly, like the more I listen to it, the more they

01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:42.120
remind me of like Erasure and all these cool synth bop bands I love, and I gotta say, I

01:34:42.120 --> 01:34:47.000
love this song, and I want to put it in tonight's cage match, it's a song by Echo Image from

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:52.400
their CD and the song is called Standing Alone. It's track two from their album. I believe

01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:57.280
it's called CompuPhonic. I'm going off the top of my head there. So here it is. So if

01:34:57.280 --> 01:35:01.200
you like Skulk, you might like this. I don't know, we'll see. This is Echo Image with Standing

01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:02.200
Alone. Enjoy.

01:35:32.200 --> 01:35:51.200
Make way for all the words they say, how could you know that they were true?

01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:54.200
Whispering voices in your head

01:35:54.200 --> 01:35:58.200
What can be done, what can be done

01:35:58.200 --> 01:36:02.200
And all the words they seem to be

01:36:02.200 --> 01:36:05.200
Not a statement

01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:09.200
See them standing when you face it

01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:12.200
They're facing with your wife

01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:16.200
Standing there alone again

01:36:16.200 --> 01:36:19.200
It all made another friend

01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:26.400
I'm watching down the road of pain Truth will never be the same

01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:33.200
Standing there alone again Still I need another friend

01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:40.400
I'm watching down the road of pain Truth will never be the same

01:36:40.400 --> 01:36:47.600
Give way for another truthless day Your eyes end up sitting on your toes

01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:50.600
You hold your breath while feeling numb

01:36:50.600 --> 01:36:54.600
Black rain clouds filling up the sun

01:36:54.600 --> 01:36:58.600
The shouting voices in your head

01:36:58.600 --> 01:37:01.600
Tell you nothing

01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:05.600
You scream but no one hears you calling

01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:08.600
You left with all your lies

01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:15.600
Lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies

01:37:15.600 --> 01:37:17.600
Yee-haw!

01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:19.600
Yee-haw!

01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:21.600
Yee-haw!

01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:23.600
Yee-haw!

01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:25.600
Standing there alone again,

01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:29.600
You shoulda made another friend,

01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:33.600
Warted down a load of planes,

01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:37.600
To tell them I need the same.

01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:39.600
Yee-haw!

01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:41.600
Yee-haw!

01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:44.600
You don't need another friend

01:38:44.600 --> 01:38:48.600
Watching them float away

01:38:48.600 --> 01:38:51.600
Truth will never be the same

01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:54.600
And then they're alone again

01:38:54.600 --> 01:38:58.600
You don't need another friend

01:38:58.600 --> 01:39:01.600
Watching them float away

01:39:01.600 --> 01:39:05.600
The truth will never be the same

01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:50.320
All right, as typical Orange Lounge fashion dictates, we'll go around and see what everyone

01:39:50.320 --> 01:39:55.040
thought of Echo Image with standing alone and not standing alone there in the corners.

01:39:55.040 --> 01:39:56.360
Dark Sakura with her impression.

01:39:56.360 --> 01:39:59.960
It freaking sounds like Depeche Mode, I like it.

01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:03.800
So that one gets a 9 for me.

01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:04.800
Nice solid 9.

01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:06.680
And it's not trance.

01:40:06.680 --> 01:40:07.680
Not really.

01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:12.080
I was going to give it an 8.5, but it really pushed it up to a 9 because it wasn't trance.

01:40:12.080 --> 01:40:15.960
It's like trance enough to satisfy my taste, but it's not trance.

01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:16.960
You're right.

01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:17.960
It's synthpop.

01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:18.960
Big difference.

01:40:18.960 --> 01:40:22.440
Really, it just made me think of, oh, this is the days when Depeche Mode was cool.

01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:23.440
I like it.

01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:24.440
All right.

01:40:24.440 --> 01:40:25.440
Moving on.

01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:26.440
Loki, what did you think of that?

01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:29.280
Well, I have this CD in my car right now, and I've been listening to it over and over

01:40:29.280 --> 01:40:32.280
over and over again, so it gets a 9 for me also.

01:40:32.280 --> 01:40:34.280
Mr. Floatwalk.

01:40:34.280 --> 01:40:42.280
It's pretty solid. It's a smooth track. That's what I like. You know, you got all the cues to synth it off, but it's not overly, you know, like...

01:40:42.280 --> 01:40:50.280
It's just not very loud and over-imposing. I just think it's something you can really relax to, and that's why I dig it a lot. I think I'll give it a 9 and a half.

01:40:50.280 --> 01:40:52.280
Ooh, lanky-style.

01:40:52.280 --> 01:41:01.280
I like it, man. So far, the two tracks I've heard from them have been really good, so I gotta listen to that CD sometime, so I'm gonna give it a 9. Good stuff.

01:41:01.280 --> 01:41:03.280
Sharks Girl.

01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:06.280
Pretty. 9.

01:41:06.280 --> 01:41:17.280
I'm gonna do something a little different, because I haven't given one of these in a while, but I'm giving that a nice, round, fat 10 out of 10, boys and girls, because honestly, that's one of the best CDs I've heard in a long time.

01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:24.280
a long time. It really grew on me. Like the first time I heard it, I was kind of like this is cool, but the more I listened to it, I was like, fuck! These guys rock!

01:41:24.280 --> 01:41:33.280
So, um, honestly, whether you call it a race or a departmental, I don't care. They just rock. And I hope to God they put out more music and continue to be in DDR. Angel?

01:41:33.280 --> 01:41:38.280
Uh, that sounds hot, as well as the rest of the CD, so you know what? Fat 10.

01:41:38.280 --> 01:41:40.280
Cool. Another fat 10. Explicit.

01:41:42.280 --> 01:41:44.280
This song gave me an orgasm.

01:41:45.280 --> 01:41:48.280
I like this song a lot though, so I give it a 9.5 out of 10.

01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:51.280
Alright. Moving on.

01:41:52.280 --> 01:41:54.280
Hi, how you doing Heather?

01:41:55.280 --> 01:41:57.280
I'm like, who the hell did the mic go to?

01:41:58.280 --> 01:42:01.280
Loki's sister's here, to give her an impression of the song.

01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:05.280
Fine, I don't matter. No, I have been drinking, but not that much.

01:42:05.280 --> 01:42:08.880
but not that much. I honestly wasn't listening to it so I really can't rate

01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:13.000
it. Then you're gonna give it a 10. Yeah, okay. All right. Hey, what's it like...

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:18.000
Anorexic 10. What's it like to be Loki's sister? Is he really as evil? Was he evil

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:24.480
like out of the womb? I don't know he was born before I was. Oh, that's right, you're

01:42:24.480 --> 01:42:27.760
a younger one. Okay, well has he been evil since being a toddler? As far back

01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:32.400
as you remember. He's chasing the fire poachers. Right on.

01:42:32.400 --> 01:42:37.400
I want more of these embarrassing Loki stories after Cagematch.

01:42:37.400 --> 01:42:43.400
It was a fire poker. It was one of those log, like, you know how they have those things that pick up logs?

01:42:43.400 --> 01:42:46.400
It was a log grabber thing you could move logs in a fire poker.

01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:50.400
We are so sending Loki out of the room after Cagematch. I want more of these stories.

01:42:50.400 --> 01:42:56.400
Alright, anybody else? Does Loki's girlfriend want to give a number to that song?

01:42:56.400 --> 01:42:59.400
Anyway, what song?

01:42:59.400 --> 01:43:11.400
Next up is Loki's pick, and Loki has picked something very special for you guys tonight. Very special. It's special.

01:43:11.400 --> 01:43:19.400
Okay, now I was gonna go with my remix, which, you know, that's just standard because I make it, and so it's gotta be in there.

01:43:19.400 --> 01:43:26.960
But no, no, um, you know my fiance had better plans so she picked this song. I don't know who it's by

01:43:27.840 --> 01:43:29.520
it's

01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:32.360
Called Papa Smurf lick my ass

01:43:32.360 --> 01:43:42.000
From Loki's girlfriend via Loki, this is song number three tonight. Papa Smurf, can I lick your ass?

01:44:02.360 --> 01:44:04.360
Make me smile in between the mountains

01:44:04.360 --> 01:44:06.860
Come on in and on my face you'll see a big grin

01:44:06.860 --> 01:44:08.360
I like a girl with a big tongue

01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:10.360
When she opens up her mouth she can touch the rung

01:44:10.360 --> 01:44:12.360
To get what's this, you gotta have guts

01:44:12.360 --> 01:44:14.360
I like it when they rub my nuts

01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:16.360
Lick my booty from the bottom to the top

01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:19.360
Just don't bow, come on bitch just drive me crazy

01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:21.360
Stick out your tongue, make me cry like a baby

01:44:21.360 --> 01:44:23.360
To push from the bottom like hoes

01:44:26.860 --> 01:44:28.860
And remember be gentle when you're lickin' my ass

Smurf it in the chocolate factory.

01:48:37.540 --> 01:48:45.540
Alright. You know what? I was going to put that in the cage match, but just because I was mad. I was just mad that I lost last week.

01:48:45.540 --> 01:48:56.540
But, honestly, it gets a 6.9 from me because it's just not as funny without the Flash animation to go with it. So, a 6.9 from me.

01:48:56.540 --> 01:48:57.540
Sharks Girl!

01:48:57.540 --> 01:49:01.540
That was the deepest and most meaningful song I've ever heard in my life.

01:49:01.540 --> 01:49:02.540
Deep.

01:49:02.540 --> 01:49:11.540
Wow, I'm just overwhelmed by the beauty of it all. I give it like a 3 for the comedy factor.

01:49:11.540 --> 01:49:14.540
Alright, DDR Angel.

01:49:14.540 --> 01:49:16.540
It looks like an ass too, there you go.

01:49:16.540 --> 01:49:17.540
DDR Angel, what do you think?

01:49:17.540 --> 01:49:21.540
Let's see, Comedial Factor 6.

01:49:21.540 --> 01:49:25.540
Explicit.

01:49:25.540 --> 01:49:33.540
No fucking comment. I'll just give it a question mark because it all depends on the people.

01:49:35.540 --> 01:49:39.540
Okay, I'll give it an 8, equal sign 3.

01:49:39.540 --> 01:49:45.540
Alright, 8 equals 3 from Jonas. Uh, lankystyle, did you have a vote you wanted to give?

01:49:45.540 --> 01:49:46.540
Penisheep.

01:49:46.540 --> 01:49:53.540
I think what I have to say is that, uh, Pop the Smurf should watch out because I'm sure she looked all the other Smurf's asses before she got to him.

01:49:53.540 --> 01:50:02.380
him yeah I give it a I mean it's a great song and all but gag factor is basically

01:50:02.380 --> 01:50:08.780
all so yeah comedy ten song is a whole eight that's not reminds me of the

01:50:08.780 --> 01:50:14.220
fanfic that my roommate roommate from college had printed out on that you

01:50:14.220 --> 01:50:17.860
remember back in the days when printer paper was all green and white and had

01:50:17.860 --> 01:50:23.420
the tearing edges on the side well my friend went to the computer lab at my

01:50:23.420 --> 01:50:30.540
school this is in 1995 mind you printed up the smuck fest someone had written a

01:50:30.540 --> 01:50:36.860
lemon fanfic about the first getting it on rose it was scary but that's what I

01:50:36.860 --> 01:50:40.040
thought makes me think of let's wrap this up so we can get past this topic

01:50:40.040 --> 01:50:43.860

sister gypsy wolf what did you get what would you give that gypsy wolf I love

01:50:50.340 --> 01:50:54.340
Having seen the animation for it, I have to say a ten.

01:50:54.340 --> 01:50:56.340
Oh wow, a ten.

01:50:56.340 --> 01:50:59.340
You're easy to please. You gave two tens tonight.

01:50:59.340 --> 01:51:00.340
Alright, that's alright.

01:51:00.340 --> 01:51:02.340
Been drinking, keep that in mind.

01:51:02.340 --> 01:51:04.340

01:52:00.060 --> 01:52:08.020
things so thank you Jamie moving on you are welcome moving on let's uh Loki watch

01:52:08.020 --> 01:52:11.060
give us a sim update what's going on in the sim world I know you've built your

01:52:11.060 --> 01:52:18.900
own thing and I know there's food makes news all sorts of fun stuff well done

01:52:18.900 --> 01:52:25.100
okay anyways um no there is some another I think camera versus last week or this

01:52:25.100 --> 01:52:29.300
week there was another update to techno fiend it looks nice it's got some cool

01:52:29.300 --> 01:52:31.300
What's Techno Theme?

01:52:59.300 --> 01:53:07.660
just announced this week that Food Mix Plus had hidden content in it. And now I have on

01:53:07.660 --> 01:53:11.780
our website how you can get to that hidden content. Basically there is a dummy file in

01:53:11.780 --> 01:53:16.700
one of the directories there and you turn that into a zip file and you get a brand new

01:53:16.700 --> 01:53:24.860
song, new steps for some of the older songs, and new Oni courses. So that's pretty cool.

01:53:24.860 --> 01:53:40.860
And then, other than that, really not that much else. Oh! Oh! No, it should be mentioned. The first pack of ripped characters from DDR 5th Mix has surfaced online. You can find the link on DDR Mania X for that one.

01:53:40.860 --> 01:53:49.860
And they're pretty nice looking. They're ripped directly from the DDR games because the guy that, um, he built his own software to do that kind of stuff, so that's kind of neat.

01:53:49.860 --> 01:53:59.860
And, um, other than that, really, um, not too much else, uh, DDR OSC 3 is going on right now. I think the first pack of songs has been released for that.

01:53:59.860 --> 01:54:04.580
And I know DDR the remix contests on the my style and

01:54:05.160 --> 01:54:09.040
DDR maniacs I think are up already. They're done. They should be posting those

01:54:09.560 --> 01:54:15.340
Those songs online for voting soon, and I think that's all yeah

01:54:16.800 --> 01:54:19.780
What you need a mic because we're not gonna hear you

01:54:21.160 --> 01:54:24.560
They added a comment section on be my install already for the Sims

01:54:25.680 --> 01:54:27.860
Yeah, that's that's new. You already have that

01:54:27.860 --> 01:54:30.860
Yeah, because I just noticed about that.

01:54:57.860 --> 01:55:00.680
answer answer answer answer

01:55:00.680 --> 01:55:02.680
yeah believe it or not we're calling out

01:55:02.680 --> 01:55:04.280
we don't do this whole lot

01:55:04.280 --> 01:55:06.320
when a radio show calls out

01:55:06.320 --> 01:55:10.180
that means you're a shock job you're doing stupid bits

01:55:10.180 --> 01:55:13.560
is your refrigerator running

01:55:13.560 --> 01:55:14.880
oh hey Siggy what's up

01:55:14.880 --> 01:55:16.520
haha

01:55:16.520 --> 01:55:19.580
I thought you were going to scot me after cage match

01:55:19.580 --> 01:55:21.920
well the cage match is done we're just waiting for the votes

01:55:21.920 --> 01:55:23.840
oh ok alright

01:55:23.840 --> 01:55:27.720
so tell me what you know about these new eight style limited editions and stuff

01:55:27.720 --> 01:55:32.520
Because I haven't really been following it, because I can barely keep track of what's going on domestically, let alone importly.

01:55:32.520 --> 01:55:35.020
So, share what you know with us, would ya?

01:55:35.020 --> 01:55:39.520
Well, here's what I've known so far about 2DX 8-Style Special Edition.

01:55:39.520 --> 01:55:45.220
They have a, well, along with 8-Style, they have a 2DX Red E-Amusement card.

01:55:45.220 --> 01:55:51.120
It's gonna be random, so we'll never know what's inside each art cover for that.

01:55:51.120 --> 01:55:52.120
Huh.

01:55:52.120 --> 01:55:55.420
Yeah, they have a 2DX Visual Emotion DVD.

01:55:55.420 --> 01:55:57.520
Oh, I can't wait for that DVD.

01:55:57.520 --> 01:56:01.760
Yeah. Let me see, I'm reading the translation right now.

01:56:01.760 --> 01:56:05.040
Yeah, they have the H-Style V-Rare soundtrack.

01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:08.360
Ooh, an H-Style V-Rare, really? Yeah.

01:56:08.360 --> 01:56:12.720
Ooh, that should be cool, okay. And then the H-Style special edition,

01:56:12.720 --> 01:56:15.960
special-made box, like, you know, like a box for

01:56:15.960 --> 01:56:19.160
stacking your preview styles from, you know, from

01:56:19.160 --> 01:56:24.600
5th, 6th, 7th, or whatever. Very nice. And then, of course, here's still a little bit

01:56:24.600 --> 01:56:25.360
interesting.

01:56:25.360 --> 01:56:28.600
It's a BeatMeIna 3DX style mail magazine.

01:56:28.600 --> 01:56:31.800
Like M-A-I-L or M-A-L-E?

01:56:31.800 --> 01:56:35.200
M-A-I-L. Okay, darn.

01:56:35.200 --> 01:56:40.880
Alright. And with any other information on what's going to be on that magazine?

01:56:40.880 --> 01:56:44.240
Well, it's just a subscription about, you know, the 2DX styles.

01:56:44.240 --> 01:56:47.920
Huh. However, you can only subscribe...

01:56:47.920 --> 01:56:53.640
We're losing you. Speak into the mic a little more. We're losing you. However, you're only going to have to subscribe within Japan.

01:56:53.640 --> 01:57:19.640
And I checked out on the WebKonami website for T-Rex XL, the price is about 106,000 yen which is, I think, or actually 10,479 yen, including tax.

01:57:19.640 --> 01:57:22.640
That sounds like a lot, but it's not quite that bad.

01:57:22.640 --> 01:57:26.640
Which is approximately $130 according to ntsx.com.

01:57:26.640 --> 01:57:30.640
Alright. Well, I'll be looking forward to it. Thanks for the update, Siggy.

01:57:30.640 --> 01:57:31.640
No problem.

01:57:31.640 --> 01:57:32.640
Alright, take care, bud.

01:57:32.640 --> 01:57:33.640
Later.

01:57:33.640 --> 01:57:34.640
Later.

01:57:34.640 --> 01:57:41.640
That's also known as DarkLionXVI. Some more information on 2DXA style. Very cool.

01:57:41.640 --> 01:57:44.640
Just to clear up something from our chat room.

01:57:44.640 --> 01:57:47.640
Hey OrangeLawnsRadio, if I'm not correct, isn't this the first time you've ever called out?

01:57:47.640 --> 01:57:52.540
called out. Actually it is not. We called out one other time and that was we were

01:57:52.540 --> 01:57:56.800
calling the person who correctly guessed. You remember Zonk Tittle Tattle? We told

01:57:56.800 --> 01:57:59.920
you guys about that a couple weeks ago and Jazz was the person that got that

01:57:59.920 --> 01:58:02.360
right. We actually called him so it's not the first time we've called out but

01:58:02.360 --> 01:58:08.920
second. Anywho, speaking of guessing since the cage match voting is now closed I'm

01:58:08.920 --> 01:58:12.200
gonna tell you guys who won that. Let's go ahead and let you guys have another

01:58:12.200 --> 01:58:18.200
chance to guess what that mystery song could be. So, Footwalk, did you have

01:58:18.200 --> 01:58:22.640
anything you want to add? Oh yeah, like when people tell you, you know, are you

01:58:22.640 --> 01:58:26.600
getting cold, are you getting hot? I will say someone in the room is pretty

01:58:26.600 --> 01:58:32.320
freaking hot. Mmm, very interesting. Yeah, I know I'm not talking about myself

01:58:32.320 --> 01:58:40.880
either, but. Some of us just can't help it. Oh my, all right. We're gonna go to a

01:58:40.880 --> 01:58:44.780
break pretty soon I think we're just gonna we're just gonna do like a bunch

01:58:44.780 --> 01:58:53.720
of like random songs in this next break so we'll probably do that well I gotta

01:58:53.720 --> 01:58:56.960
find those songs though so somebody has to help me fill time who's gonna help

01:58:56.960 --> 01:59:06.440
full time oh I've had how many shots now like I think well most of this glass so

01:59:06.440 --> 01:59:13.680
that would be six shots yeah I'm feeling okay but a little dizzy little slightly

01:59:13.680 --> 01:59:21.600
dizzy you know what not really I feel we're like it's you know if it were a

01:59:21.600 --> 01:59:26.640
cheat night it would be on I need to sit down with someone with some either dark

01:59:26.640 --> 01:59:33.640
rum or tequila and just do shots.

01:59:35.840 --> 01:59:41.120
Um, let's see.

01:59:41.120 --> 01:59:46.440
Okay, um, other than that, let's see, what else can I talk about?

01:59:46.440 --> 01:59:48.320
I should have brought my amaretto for you.

01:59:48.320 --> 01:59:49.640
Oh, oh!

01:59:49.640 --> 01:59:53.360
You know what, actually, um, where's Gypsy Wolf? Because the chat room is reminding me of

01:59:53.360 --> 01:59:54.900
something. Gypsy Wolf,

01:59:54.900 --> 01:59:56.900
We need- we need embarrassing Loki stories.

01:59:56.900 --> 01:59:59.400
Can we give you a couple minutes?

01:59:59.400 --> 02:00:02.400
I suppose we can give you a couple minutes. Alright, in the meantime, Loki.

02:00:02.400 --> 02:00:04.400
We'll do embarrassing Loki stories after the break.

02:00:04.400 --> 02:00:07.400
We do have to get into the Effies of the Week soon, though.

02:00:07.400 --> 02:00:11.400
Do you guys want to hear who won tonight's cage match, actually?

02:00:11.400 --> 02:00:12.900
I guess.

02:00:12.900 --> 02:00:14.400
We'll get to it in a minute.

02:00:14.400 --> 02:00:19.400
But I will tell you that one song just, like, obliterated the competition.

02:00:19.400 --> 02:00:24.400
It totally blew the competition out of the water. Can you guess what song it is?

02:00:24.400 --> 02:00:26.800
Which song would you guys think it is that obliterated the others?

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:34.400
Papa Smurfs Papa Smurfs. What do you think women because our listeners tend to go for the gross potty humor

02:00:34.640 --> 02:00:40.200
All right. Well, I mean how else did Loki win the cage match by singing? I'm staying in here

02:00:40.480 --> 02:00:43.020
Here's tonight's winner of the orange lounge cage match

02:00:43.020 --> 02:00:51.020
Chat room, you have restored my faith in you.

02:00:51.020 --> 02:00:57.020
All right, very nice. An upset there by Echo Image winning tonight's cage match was standing

02:00:57.020 --> 02:00:58.020
alone.

02:00:58.020 --> 02:01:00.500
I'm still getting my revenge next week.

02:01:00.500 --> 02:01:05.900
About twice the votes that Bond got. Papa Smurf got one pity.

02:01:05.900 --> 02:01:10.260
Oh my God, our listeners have taste.

02:01:10.260 --> 02:01:11.260
Very nice.

02:01:11.260 --> 02:01:15.460
Oh, and Nelly says they obviously don't.

02:01:15.460 --> 02:01:17.060
Oh, Nelly's upset.

02:01:17.060 --> 02:01:18.060
That's alright.

02:01:18.060 --> 02:01:24.220
You know, I would even, I would even go on a limb and say that this almost restores my

02:01:24.220 --> 02:01:25.220
faith in humanity.

02:01:25.220 --> 02:01:26.220
Almost.

02:01:26.220 --> 02:01:28.500
Almost, but not quite.

02:01:28.500 --> 02:01:36.140
I know, I wouldn't go quite that far, but okay.

02:01:36.140 --> 02:01:41.220
Let's see, I'm still trying to prep for the next break, because there's songs

02:01:41.220 --> 02:01:44.260
I'm looking for a little random mix of songs. I want to play for you guys certainly

02:01:44.260 --> 02:01:50.460
I want to know who that one person was what one person the one person who voted I would share, but I'll let them

02:01:51.180 --> 02:01:53.540
Reveal their identity in the chat room if they want to oh

02:01:57.380 --> 02:01:58.620
Free

02:01:58.620 --> 02:02:04.420
Mel says a free max to be rare if the max to or an extreme. Oh, he only says max to

02:02:05.460 --> 02:02:10.420
Hey, hey, that's stupid. How's it going? Hey, I might have fallen for that because I would have been all be rare

02:02:10.420 --> 02:02:13.600
I'll just throw a, like, a giant paper mache V at them.

02:02:13.600 --> 02:02:18.620
Alright, um, sorry guys, sorry guys, we can't take requests this break because we have songs

02:02:18.620 --> 02:02:24.060
we really, really want to play for you guys, and, uh, here we go, we will be right back

02:02:24.060 --> 02:02:27.440
with more Orange Launch Radio and the FUs of the Week coming up when we get back as

02:02:27.440 --> 02:02:28.440
well.

02:02:28.440 --> 02:02:29.440
Please don't send those in yet.

02:02:29.440 --> 02:02:30.440
Any more clues?

02:02:30.440 --> 02:02:31.440
More clues?

02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:35.440
Maybe, but, um, send in those, uh, guesses right now.

02:02:35.440 --> 02:02:42.440
The Clues Never Stop here on Orange Lake Radio. We'll be back.

02:04:05.440 --> 02:04:09.040
Anytime that I hear the jacks play I gotta tell them have a double skit out my way

Puts up the kids and I'm playing some keys I can buy a stereo, you can keep the receipts

And nobody moves the crowd the way I do I've hit brand new boys on my charges

02:04:15.940 --> 02:04:18.740
Heard the boom boom baby girl never get beat off Johnny Dynamite

02:04:18.740 --> 02:04:20.740
Let them know I've been here, the jacks the only one

Just a nightfall, the first time

02:06:01.300 --> 02:06:04.300
Just about half past ten

02:06:04.300 --> 02:06:08.300
For the first time in history

02:06:08.300 --> 02:06:12.300
Gotta start prayin' then

02:06:12.300 --> 02:06:15.300
It's prayin' then

02:06:15.300 --> 02:06:18.300
Hallelujah, it's prayin' then

02:06:18.300 --> 02:06:19.300
Amen

02:06:19.300 --> 02:06:22.300
It's prayin' then

02:06:22.300 --> 02:06:25.300
Hallelujah, it's prayin' then

02:06:55.300 --> 02:06:58.580
informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

02:06:58.580 --> 02:07:02.980
is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

02:07:02.980 --> 02:07:08.980
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

02:07:08.980 --> 02:07:12.020
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:07:12.020 --> 02:07:15.740
Logie. Hallelujah, it's raining men.

02:07:15.740 --> 02:07:19.660
Moving on, we are

02:07:19.660 --> 02:07:23.820
speaking of, you know, things that have been

02:07:23.820 --> 02:07:27.260
coming over me private message we have some more guesses

02:07:27.260 --> 02:07:30.400
for the song that we've been trying to guess all night long

02:07:30.400 --> 02:07:34.420
Mel, it starts off with, I'm sorry, Float, it starts off with this one

02:07:34.420 --> 02:07:39.320
this is a good one from El Mullet the guess is Divine Sweet Divide by Tanya

02:07:39.320 --> 02:07:40.620
Donole and this is why

02:07:40.620 --> 02:07:43.820
the jam on the bagel is sweet and sells divide

02:07:43.820 --> 02:07:46.940
too abstract sorry yeah a little bit too abstract but

02:07:46.940 --> 02:07:51.020
not a bad guess there I like the way you're thinking

02:07:51.020 --> 02:07:52.840
Yeah, I like the ways that you do.

02:07:52.840 --> 02:07:56.440
John Field says, cytoplasm by WND Games.

02:07:56.440 --> 02:07:58.380
Cytoplasm is unique in all cells.

02:07:58.380 --> 02:08:00.520
In fact, it holds everything inside a cell,

02:08:00.520 --> 02:08:02.800
and a cell always has a nucleus, which

02:08:02.800 --> 02:08:05.000
is round like a doughnut hole.

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:06.200
Sold.

02:08:06.200 --> 02:08:08.720
Not quite.

02:08:08.720 --> 02:08:11.440
Although probably right now, with these guesses,

02:08:11.440 --> 02:08:13.280
I'm probably relearning everything.

02:08:13.280 --> 02:08:15.440
I've forgotten physiology, man.

02:08:15.440 --> 02:08:18.320
I sucked at biology, except when we talked

02:08:18.320 --> 02:08:19.560
about the reproductive system.

02:08:19.560 --> 02:08:21.560
Oh yeah, I aced that sucker.

02:08:22.560 --> 02:08:24.560
Alright, that's all the guesses so far.

02:08:24.560 --> 02:08:26.560
That's all?

02:08:26.560 --> 02:08:27.560
Yeah, that's it so far.

02:08:27.560 --> 02:08:29.560
My goodness.

02:08:29.560 --> 02:08:32.560
We'll see you a little later.

02:08:32.560 --> 02:08:34.560
We'll open it up for more guesses.

02:08:34.560 --> 02:08:37.560
Like I said guys, I mentioned before the last music bed.

02:08:37.560 --> 02:08:40.560
Someone in the room is very hot on its trail.

02:08:40.560 --> 02:08:45.560
After that last batch, somebody else is just like smoking, honestly.

02:08:45.560 --> 02:08:48.560
I mean, just thinking a little too far into it.

02:08:48.560 --> 02:08:52.560
Can you honestly clue me into what we're talking about?

02:08:52.560 --> 02:08:55.560
Shut up.

02:08:55.560 --> 02:08:57.560
Alright.

02:08:57.560 --> 02:09:02.560
Let's see, I think we should do the FUs of the Week now. What do you guys think?

02:09:02.560 --> 02:09:06.560
Okay, we don't have to. I mean, we can just stay here.

02:09:06.560 --> 02:09:09.560
Damn it, I need to vent.

02:09:09.560 --> 02:09:13.560
You know what? No, I'm sorry. Before we vent, though, where's Gypsy Wolf?

02:09:13.560 --> 02:09:16.560
Because the chat room is begging for more Loki stories.

02:09:16.560 --> 02:09:19.920
Loki, could you please leave the room for a minute? Bye, Loki.

02:09:19.920 --> 02:09:24.320
Yes, bye. No, Loki. Bye, Loki. Nellie, can you take him in the bedroom?

02:09:24.320 --> 02:09:26.320
Oh, what's the worst? All he's going to do is object to things.

02:09:26.320 --> 02:09:29.360
All right, all right, yeah. He won't have a microphone, so it won't matter.

02:09:29.360 --> 02:09:34.400
So, any funny childhood stories from Loki?

02:09:34.400 --> 02:09:38.560
Okay, well, okay. Anybody's familiar with constructs?

02:09:38.560 --> 02:09:41.840
The building toys? The kind of snapular? Those little blue things?

02:09:41.840 --> 02:09:45.840
Whatever. Okay, well, one thing that, you know, I used to do

02:09:45.840 --> 02:09:50.240
would be this this was also before i was no this was after i was born but i was too young to

02:09:50.240 --> 02:09:55.680
remember most of it i saw pictures my mom showed me so anyway but you would build um power suits

02:09:55.680 --> 02:10:01.760
out of the constructs and run around the house with them you know shoot the dog whatever was cool

02:10:02.400 --> 02:10:07.680
but uh i don't know i can't really remember all that dad oh the one that was the best thing i

02:10:07.680 --> 02:10:13.120
love this this wasn't embarrassing this is just fun um it was uh it was mission control with our

02:10:13.120 --> 02:10:20.960
dog and Matt would look you would sit there and he would our dog our Labrador

02:10:20.960 --> 02:10:26.200
would walk around the house and do stuff eat drink etc her normal thing and he

02:10:26.200 --> 02:10:30.060
would say Houston we are taking in water and she would drink basically I would do

02:10:30.060 --> 02:10:34.680
I would do the you know the ground control at NASA's commentary on

02:10:34.680 --> 02:10:39.300
everything that my dog was doing as if it were like some sort of spaceship or

02:10:39.300 --> 02:10:44.220
something it made people crack up like craziness funny um it was great when she

02:10:44.220 --> 02:10:48.040
was downloading you know cargo and taking a dump out back oh yeah but it

02:10:48.040 --> 02:10:54.800
was great jettisoning fuel my dog is awesome she's dead anyway pets are cool

02:10:54.800 --> 02:11:01.800
but you know I mean that is so wrong what else were they used to do oh yeah

02:11:01.800 --> 02:11:05.960
we have like um what else was it um I can't remember much we I mean we did a

02:11:05.960 --> 02:11:09.960
We did a lot with Marble Works. We did a lot of crap with that. We put water down them and shit.

02:11:09.960 --> 02:11:13.960
We hit Army Men in Mom's Bicus Tree.

02:11:13.960 --> 02:11:17.960
No, I remember now. I have a water balloon launcher

02:11:17.960 --> 02:11:21.960
and I used to launch tennis balls at the people on the bike trail

02:11:21.960 --> 02:11:25.960
over the green belt from us. It was cool because you can, like, hit those people

02:11:25.960 --> 02:11:29.960
from 200 yards away. And we got lucky one time and we hit a guy

02:11:29.960 --> 02:11:33.960
and he fell over and that was funny. Yeah, that was that and then there was those little

02:11:33.960 --> 02:11:37.720
guys you could do, or you could get army men and strap parachutes to them on really windy

02:11:37.720 --> 02:11:42.300
days, they'd fly right over the house. You'd watch them go. Like, bye! Melted quite a few

02:11:42.300 --> 02:11:49.300
army men too, that was kinda cool. I'm trying to think. Did he ever shit himself or anything?

02:11:49.660 --> 02:11:55.960
I ate dog food. As a kid. He ate a whole entire bowl of gravy train. Gravy from ear to ear

02:11:55.960 --> 02:11:59.520
when he was a kid. Dude, it had meat in it, okay? If it's good enough for the dog, it's

02:11:59.520 --> 02:12:00.520
Meech!

02:12:00.520 --> 02:12:01.520
Give me Meech!

02:12:01.520 --> 02:12:05.720
The dog's like, what the hell, where'd my food go?

02:12:05.720 --> 02:12:08.580
Alright, well thank you for sharing those with us, we needed some good embarrassing

02:12:08.580 --> 02:12:11.880
Loki stories, so...

02:12:11.880 --> 02:12:13.800
They weren't that bad, but they were still funny.

02:12:13.800 --> 02:12:14.800
They were cute.

02:12:14.800 --> 02:12:15.920
They were cute.

02:12:15.920 --> 02:12:21.840
I killed the man with a trident through his chest.

02:12:21.840 --> 02:12:22.840
I found-

02:12:22.840 --> 02:12:25.840
It's from Anchorman, I'm sorry.

02:12:25.840 --> 02:12:26.840
Alright.

02:12:26.840 --> 02:12:27.840
Okay.

02:12:27.840 --> 02:12:29.840
Yes, Dark Sakura.

02:12:29.840 --> 02:12:30.840
Nothing.

02:12:30.840 --> 02:12:31.840
Alright.

02:12:31.840 --> 02:12:32.840
Then I think it's...

02:12:32.840 --> 02:12:33.840
I think it's...

02:12:33.840 --> 02:12:34.840
I have pictures too.

02:12:34.840 --> 02:12:37.200
Do you have pictures?

02:12:37.200 --> 02:12:38.200
They have pictures too.

02:12:38.200 --> 02:12:40.720
It's in my photo album somewhere.

02:12:40.720 --> 02:12:41.720
My baby photo album.

02:12:41.720 --> 02:12:42.720
Does this mean we can call you Alpo?

02:12:42.720 --> 02:12:43.720
Uh, I think it was Gravy Train.

02:12:43.720 --> 02:12:44.720
Gravy Train!

02:12:44.720 --> 02:12:57.720
It was the kind that you pour in the water into it and it makes the gravy.

02:12:57.720 --> 02:13:01.720
Did you go around chasing the little imaginary, you know, wagon?

02:13:03.720 --> 02:13:04.720
No.

02:13:05.720 --> 02:13:08.720
I have a question. Loki, what does this remind you of?

02:13:12.720 --> 02:13:13.720
L3?

02:13:13.720 --> 02:13:14.720
No.

02:13:17.720 --> 02:13:18.720
Rob?

02:13:18.720 --> 02:13:19.720
What?

02:13:19.720 --> 02:13:23.720
I just had the worst idea ever, and no, this had nothing to do with Andrew.

02:13:23.720 --> 02:13:24.720
Okay?

02:13:24.720 --> 02:13:27.600
Next remix for Loki.

02:13:27.600 --> 02:13:31.680
Uh, long chain runnin' but he has to do something with

02:13:31.680 --> 02:13:36.520
dogs or something. He probably needs to do a remix of Disco Dog.

02:13:36.520 --> 02:13:39.840
Anyway, let's get into the FUs of the Week.

02:13:39.840 --> 02:13:45.040
Alright, Jamie why do we have to do the FUs of the Week every single week on

02:13:45.040 --> 02:13:45.560
this show?

02:13:45.560 --> 02:13:52.560
cuz we're full of to anger

02:14:02.500 --> 02:14:06.040
an FU to John Fields for making me laugh while I have a headache

02:14:06.040 --> 02:14:12.800
for shiny disco dog balls

02:14:12.800 --> 02:14:26.800
My first F.U. goes to the chat room for not guessing correctly, and not enough of you guessing, so god damn it guess, and to Silent Ben for misspelling the word that you misspelled.

02:14:26.800 --> 02:14:44.400
There's a site called dictionary.com, just use it, learn how to spell please people and

02:14:44.400 --> 02:14:52.920
learn grammar and by the way, you is not spelled you, that is a letter, it's y-o-u, your is

02:14:52.920 --> 02:14:58.200
spelled y-o-u-apostrophe-r-e or y-o-u-r depending on the context you're using the

02:14:58.200 --> 02:15:06.960
word not you are okay now if they put apostrophe u apostrophe u then that

02:15:06.960 --> 02:15:12.040
would be okay how would it be okay because an apostrophe is for if you're

02:15:12.040 --> 02:15:17.760
shortening the word so but there are only certain allowed abbreviations of

02:15:17.760 --> 02:15:26.600
words that are grammatically correct that are commonly accepted by people who

02:15:26.600 --> 02:15:30.680
have been educated that doesn't matter we the third grade they're not educated

02:15:30.680 --> 02:15:37.760
we know that and normally normally I'm I've gotten a whole but I've gotten off

02:15:37.760 --> 02:15:42.960
of my whole grammar fiend kick I got it like but it just I hit my saturation

02:15:42.960 --> 02:15:45.200
point sometimes.

02:15:45.200 --> 02:15:59.640
So anyway, another F.U. goes to the people on the road who

02:15:59.640 --> 02:16:03.320
are major assholes and don't know how to drive.

02:16:03.320 --> 02:16:07.680
Amazingly enough, my drive here was without incident.

02:16:07.680 --> 02:16:11.240
But a lot of my driving lately, especially to and from

02:16:11.240 --> 02:16:15.920
work have been full of people who usually drive semis who don't know how

02:16:15.920 --> 02:16:22.800
to drive semis are cool okay I hate the ones that are like the trucks full of

02:16:22.800 --> 02:16:26.880
gravel but the gravel flies all the way up I have a crack in my windshield now

02:16:26.880 --> 02:16:32.280
because of the freaking rock truck it's like you asked and it's gonna cost like

02:16:32.280 --> 02:16:36.480
$300 if I wanted to replace my windshield I mean it's so minor that I

02:16:36.480 --> 02:16:39.800
can live with the look but it's there and right in the corner of my vision

02:16:39.800 --> 02:16:46.500
it's like it's it there's what my car is already raped and now I've got a crack

02:16:46.500 --> 02:16:49.780
it's not a crack it's like it's not a crack it's a chip in the windshield is

02:16:49.780 --> 02:16:59.860
what it is and up his meal so so uh another if you goes to the hot I I

02:16:59.860 --> 02:17:05.180
really dislike this part of living in Sacramento I love the winter because I

02:17:05.180 --> 02:17:09.220
like the rain a whole lot and I like the one I moved out here it was raining and

02:17:09.220 --> 02:17:12.220
I was like, oh, it's just like Alabama, yay.

02:17:12.220 --> 02:17:18.940
But anyway, it's just a pain in the ass.

02:17:18.940 --> 02:17:21.060
You know, we think this is getting real cool.

02:17:21.060 --> 02:17:24.020
And then it's hot, so it's like, what's up with that?

02:17:24.020 --> 02:17:27.460
Also, an F.U. goes to my apartment manager for me

02:17:27.460 --> 02:17:30.660
having told her weekly for the last month

02:17:30.660 --> 02:17:32.540
to fix my goddamn air conditioning,

02:17:32.540 --> 02:17:34.100
and it's not fixed yet.

02:17:34.100 --> 02:17:37.300
And again, with it getting into triple digit heat

02:17:37.300 --> 02:17:38.960
and not having a working air conditioner,

02:17:38.960 --> 02:17:40.420
That's like a health hazard.

02:17:40.420 --> 02:17:45.880
You know in Arizona, if your apartment manager doesn't fix

02:17:45.880 --> 02:17:47.900
your air conditioning in your apartment, you can take them

02:17:47.900 --> 02:17:49.980
to court for it.

02:17:49.980 --> 02:17:53.100
And I wouldn't be surprised if you could do it here.

02:17:53.100 --> 02:17:55.700
And seriously here, I mean, I honestly would have grounds

02:17:55.700 --> 02:18:00.660
for negligence, because there is a statute that's referred

02:18:00.660 --> 02:18:02.340
to as duty of utmost care.

02:18:02.340 --> 02:18:11.220
And see, I know this because I'm taking business law right now, so don't fuck with me.

02:18:11.220 --> 02:18:17.340
But no, it's especially like for hotels, for people who run facilities, there's a duty

02:18:17.340 --> 02:18:24.160
of utmost care to provide services to tenants, to guests, you know, that they need to make

02:18:24.160 --> 02:18:28.740
sure that they provide a place that's going to be safe to live, safe to exist, you know,

02:18:28.740 --> 02:18:35.100
to operate in, and this is not, you know, safe. You know, when it gets up that hot and

02:18:35.100 --> 02:18:40.620
there's no way to keep cool, then that's dangerous. It's getting bad.

02:18:40.620 --> 02:18:47.180
Leave my foot alone.

02:18:47.180 --> 02:18:57.620
Another, um, F.U. goes toward, uh, American River College. And this is why. Alright, for

02:18:57.620 --> 02:19:00.740
For anyone who's been paying attention to my live journal, there's been the saga of

02:19:00.740 --> 02:19:02.060
my student loan check.

02:19:02.060 --> 02:19:06.380
And see, I work for my lender, so I know where my money is.

02:19:06.380 --> 02:19:08.740
I know when my funds have been disbursed.

02:19:08.740 --> 02:19:13.500
I know how to do your job, financial aid department at ARC.

02:19:13.500 --> 02:19:16.500
I could do your job blindfolded.

02:19:16.500 --> 02:19:23.100
So when I'm told that my check is mailed out last Friday, and it's, you know, I check the

02:19:23.100 --> 02:19:28.340
every day I'm not meaning last Friday as in two days ago I'm meaning the week

02:19:28.340 --> 02:19:38.220
before it does not take seven days to mail a check in town okay maybe two but

02:19:38.220 --> 02:19:44.060
not in Carmichael when ARC is six minutes from my house and the post office

02:19:44.060 --> 02:19:50.780
is six minutes from both ARC and my house no this is just it so I'm gonna

02:19:50.780 --> 02:19:57.620
call them on Tuesday and say excuse me bitches if my money isn't here within

02:19:57.620 --> 02:20:01.980
the next two business days give me my money your asses are getting reported to

02:20:01.980 --> 02:20:05.820
the Department of Education and you know what they will do to you they will pull

02:20:05.820 --> 02:20:15.420
your funding oh okay I vented that's like been my rage for the week yeah you

02:20:15.420 --> 02:20:20.220
forgot it was a three-hour show here for a minute yeah I just had a build-up of

02:20:20.220 --> 02:20:27.220
rage and no I feel better. You feel better? Yeah I feel better. What do you have to say?

02:20:27.500 --> 02:20:33.260
My foot says get this thing away from me bitch. Oh we found the third mic, scary. Moving on

02:20:33.260 --> 02:20:40.260
let's go to Loki and Loki's FUs of the week. Yeah I'm starting to get a little dizzy, that's

02:20:40.260 --> 02:20:43.960
uh... yeah

02:20:43.960 --> 02:20:47.520
I'm starting to get a little dizzy, that's cool

02:20:47.520 --> 02:20:51.600
now first F.U. goes to my stupid cabinet in the god damn I-Pack 2 for not working

02:20:51.600 --> 02:20:55.640
I don't even know why, because it works for like two seconds, or like, well maybe a little longer

02:20:55.640 --> 02:20:58.800
two seconds, but like 30 seconds or like half a song in DDR

02:20:58.800 --> 02:21:02.240
and it just stops working for no reason, and I don't know why, I thought it was

02:21:02.240 --> 02:21:04.800
conflicting with the I-Pack 4 that I had in there, but

02:21:04.800 --> 02:21:08.200
no, that's not the case because I unplugged the other one, and it still breaks

02:21:08.200 --> 02:21:16.700
So apparently, my shitty solder job that I did on it, um, didn't work, so I need to, um, I don't know, get a new one, I guess.

02:21:16.700 --> 02:21:20.700
Maybe it's because it shares the name with a crappy Mac it off the computer.

02:21:20.700 --> 02:21:23.700
Oh, oh, I'm sorry, I forgot there's a Mac lever in here.

02:21:23.700 --> 02:21:25.700
I'm gonna go run and hide now.

02:21:25.700 --> 02:21:29.700
Oh yeah, I'm coming after you, and I'm gonna clock you over here with my iPod.

02:21:29.700 --> 02:21:36.700
Fuck you to the new, um, iMacs, because, um, well, you can make them look prettier, but they're still gonna suck.

02:21:36.700 --> 02:21:39.700
I see you can make them look prettier, but they're still gonna suck.

02:21:39.700 --> 02:21:42.700
Dude, what is this? Like, crap on the Mac fan bay?

02:21:42.700 --> 02:21:48.700
Sorry, it's just, it's no fair to you, because you happen to have a bunch of IBM freaks here, so...

02:21:48.700 --> 02:21:52.700
You know what, if I had $3,000, I'd love to buy it.

02:21:52.700 --> 02:21:57.700
What the hell is the I in the iMac and iPod? What the hell does i mean?

02:21:57.700 --> 02:21:59.700
Internet or something, I don't know, what?

02:21:59.700 --> 02:22:03.700
Like, I don't know how to use computers, so I'd buy this piece of shit. Mac.

02:22:03.700 --> 02:22:07.700
The opinions expressed on this show by Loki.

02:22:07.700 --> 02:22:15.700
Seriously, I think Apple computers are for people that don't know how to use computers, but think that pretty computers are good.

02:22:15.700 --> 02:22:23.700
Loki is very lucky. He's far across the room from me right now, but he's not far enough to miss being hit in the head by a soda bottle or something.

02:22:23.700 --> 02:22:26.820
now now now now now we have

02:22:26.820 --> 02:22:30.220
and defense and Apple I

02:22:30.220 --> 02:22:34.420
played on an Apple II computer and I played a lot of kicks on that loadrunner

02:22:34.420 --> 02:22:35.380
so okay

02:22:35.380 --> 02:22:39.940
I forgot without Apple we would not have had Oregon Trail represent

02:22:39.940 --> 02:22:44.380
yeah or the first version of Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego

02:22:44.380 --> 02:22:48.660
or or Odell Lake yeah I was gonna say Odell Lake

02:22:48.660 --> 02:23:02.660
My first computer was a Mac, and it came in that little box with the 5 inch screen, and I played a lot of Where in the World was Carmen Sandiego on that thing.

02:23:02.660 --> 02:23:12.660
Oh my god, and you know, who needs to upgrade my computer or even work on it? Because I can't get to it because god damn it, the monitor and the computer are the same damn thing!

02:23:12.660 --> 02:23:23.660
My first computer was a Texas Instruments computer, where I spent five hours programming in BASIC to watch a little ball bounce back and forth across the screen and change color.

02:23:23.660 --> 02:23:31.660
And I forgot about Max's contribution to the first person shooter realm, Marathon, because that game is so much better than Quake and Unreal any day.

02:23:31.660 --> 02:23:36.660
Okay, those games weren't even out yet when Marathon came out, man.

02:23:36.660 --> 02:23:38.660
Whatever.

02:23:38.660 --> 02:23:42.660
I can go on for hours about how bad Apple sucks, but I don't think I will.

02:23:42.660 --> 02:23:44.660
Let's talk about Microsoft.

02:23:44.660 --> 02:23:49.660
Microsoft sucks too, because Service Pack 2 is lame.

02:23:49.660 --> 02:23:52.660
At least he's an equal opportunity offender.

02:23:52.660 --> 02:24:00.660
They said Microsoft Windows is never going to be secure until about 2011, 2015.

02:24:00.660 --> 02:24:03.660
Well, thank you for warning me. I'm buying your piece of shit now.

02:24:03.660 --> 02:24:07.700
Oh wait, no, I'm not buying your piece of shit now. I'm downloading it for free. Ha ha ha

02:24:08.700 --> 02:24:13.440
Anyways, you know by then the hackers will have new, you know, things it doesn't matter

02:24:13.440 --> 02:24:19.480
It's just you know, their software's gonna suck no matter what they have it's all we have. Okay?

02:24:20.960 --> 02:24:22.960
That's what you get when you outsource

02:24:23.340 --> 02:24:28.680
You know those people in yet. They're just not sharp as those people in you know America. No, wait, I'm wrong

02:24:28.680 --> 02:24:30.680
They are sharper than them

02:24:30.680 --> 02:24:39.680
Anyways, um, no, other than that, um, really not anything else I'm mad at other than, um,

02:24:39.680 --> 02:24:44.440
well, not anyone being accused last night because there, I don't know where the hell

02:24:44.440 --> 02:24:45.440
people were in Vacaville.

02:24:45.440 --> 02:24:49.640
No, no, no, I'm not talking about you, I'm talking about the Vacaville folk that normally

02:24:49.640 --> 02:24:50.640
are there.

02:24:50.640 --> 02:24:51.640
Oh, is that normal?

02:24:51.640 --> 02:24:52.640
You know, there's no skater cowboy, no anything.

02:24:52.640 --> 02:24:54.520
Oh yeah, no skater cowboy.

02:24:54.520 --> 02:24:56.800
It was just, no one there.

02:24:56.800 --> 02:25:03.840
like oh my god they left Vacaville that's scary anyways were there any cows

02:25:03.840 --> 02:25:12.720
there no I don't know I think they're on vacation too but yeah that that's pretty

02:25:12.720 --> 02:25:31.020
Pretty much all I've got right now is just those few things and yeah, I'm done.

02:25:31.020 --> 02:25:36.580
No things just keep getting worse, no actually it's been an okay week but I would just first

02:25:36.580 --> 02:25:40.020
like to say you know what, if I was going to say FU to Apple that's because I was a

02:25:40.020 --> 02:25:44.220
Commodore 64 fan back in the day but you know but I have been I've been

02:25:44.220 --> 02:25:48.860
contemplating buying a Mac laptop I am NOT gonna listen to Loki I kind of want

02:25:48.860 --> 02:25:53.580
one anyway cuz laptops are different I think laptops are different because you

02:25:53.580 --> 02:25:57.980
can't upgrade even a PC laptop very easily so not very easily you can put up

02:25:57.980 --> 02:26:01.860
like a memory upgrade that's the main thing you can do I want one I want one

02:26:01.860 --> 02:26:10.280
where otherwise an F you I don't know an F you to the fact that I'm leaving

02:26:10.280 --> 02:26:16.200
again in just over a week and that makes me sad and I don't want to leave again

02:26:16.200 --> 02:26:20.240
for two weeks especially with everything that's kind of going on back home I don't

02:26:20.240 --> 02:26:24.640
want to get a lot of money I could get stars you get paid in money and sex yeah

02:26:24.640 --> 02:26:29.920
I'm on the other hand at the same time I shut up Nellie at the same time like

02:26:29.920 --> 02:26:33.020
Like when I do go, the company pays for all my food, so like that'll be extra money that

02:26:33.020 --> 02:26:35.020
I can spend on video games!

02:26:35.020 --> 02:26:39.980
No, go ahead and finish the FUs, I completely forgot about that.

02:26:39.980 --> 02:26:43.980
I guess I'm done since the rest of you are going to take all the time.

02:26:43.980 --> 02:26:44.980
Ooh.

02:26:44.980 --> 02:26:45.980
Aww.

02:26:45.980 --> 02:26:53.080
No, no, no, this wasn't about FUs of the Week, this is, I won a trip to San Diego in October.

02:26:53.080 --> 02:26:58.000
I'm going to be staying at the Hotel Del Coronado

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:02.380
which is basically a fucking expensive hotel, which is also haunted

02:27:02.380 --> 02:27:07.680
and uh... take your germanium, I mean your portal to hell, I mean your...

02:27:07.680 --> 02:27:08.980
Shut up!

02:27:08.980 --> 02:27:12.800
I'll never get past security on the plane. They'll think it's a bomb.

02:27:12.800 --> 02:27:13.800
Oh, nevermind.

02:27:13.800 --> 02:27:18.760
What is that bomb you have? It's not a bomb, you said bomb, you're a terrorist!

02:27:18.760 --> 02:27:22.400
Okay, that's all I have. But yeah, Hotel Del Coronado.

02:27:22.400 --> 02:27:27.480
Awesome place in San Diego. All expenses paid by my work. Awesome. Yummy

02:27:28.580 --> 02:27:31.980
OLR stalker fans now you know where to find them. All right, moving on

02:27:32.900 --> 02:27:36.380
Let's go to float walk with his FUs of the week

02:27:37.380 --> 02:27:44.180
Lordy, well, I'm gonna keep this actually pretty short. First FU of the week goes to all the people over

02:27:44.700 --> 02:27:50.400
there in Japan's board to say that the people who are creating steps for Ultramic 2

02:27:50.400 --> 02:27:54.000
who don't deserve to be doing any of it.

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:57.600
Oh, like you people do over on the board. Come on.

02:27:57.600 --> 02:28:00.400
It's funny because one of the biggest arguments is,

02:28:00.400 --> 02:28:04.400
well, I've never seen any of these guys ranked on the Simphile community.

02:28:04.400 --> 02:28:06.000
I'm still here thinking, what the hell?

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:07.800
That should be a credit.

02:28:07.800 --> 02:28:09.400
Yeah, exactly.

02:28:09.400 --> 02:28:11.000
I'm still here thinking, OK, wonderful.

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:17.700
90% of Simphiles I've seen are 1,100 finger step patterns.

02:28:17.700 --> 02:28:22.360
I mean, okay, you try putting 200 pounds of pressure on those fingers and doing that,

02:28:22.360 --> 02:28:25.900
then maybe, just maybe, I'll give you a little bit of credit there.

02:28:25.900 --> 02:28:31.340
And like, you know, meanwhile, you're doing, you know, having a real life and making money

02:28:31.340 --> 02:28:35.700
doing your job, where these other people who have no jobs are sitting there doing nothing

02:28:35.700 --> 02:28:38.300
but making steps and putting them on communities and stuff.

02:28:38.300 --> 02:28:41.700
Hey, I know there's a lot of probably a few cool, you know, people there online doing

02:28:41.700 --> 02:28:45.420
these steps, but seriously, you've got a life you need to take care of first.

02:28:45.420 --> 02:28:49.740
uh... i mean you got all that going on in our thinking with all the ed to make

02:28:49.740 --> 02:28:50.660
it simple

02:28:50.660 --> 02:28:53.660
guess what you're just make your basically played two d x there you know

02:28:53.660 --> 02:28:56.820
yeah it was the other day you know i don't want to know i'm on

02:28:56.820 --> 02:28:58.300
arrow smashing

02:28:58.300 --> 02:29:01.460
uh... you know it is and noticed they weren't we don't know we're talking about

02:29:01.460 --> 02:29:03.140
were under qualified for it

02:29:03.140 --> 02:29:04.940
i'd i could go off about

02:29:04.940 --> 02:29:06.380
how could you know we

02:29:06.380 --> 02:29:08.780
you know we are in all of that but you know it played a m

02:29:08.780 --> 02:29:10.020
that they are a lot of it

02:29:10.020 --> 02:29:11.200
but already

02:29:11.200 --> 02:29:14.100
uh... i mean i think you know what the game drops i think people are

02:29:14.100 --> 02:29:15.780
definitely going to be pleasantly surprised.

02:29:15.780 --> 02:29:18.340
And you know what though, people are still going to hate, same thing I was telling Seeker

02:29:18.340 --> 02:29:21.620
when he was here, I said, you know what, no matter what, when the game comes out, people

02:29:21.620 --> 02:29:26.140
are going to hate the steps that whoever those folks at Konami put in the steps did put in

02:29:26.140 --> 02:29:30.620
there, because it happens every single time. And damn right those people are going to bitch,

02:29:30.620 --> 02:29:32.780
because they didn't do the steps, they're going to say, I'm going to make something

02:29:32.780 --> 02:29:33.780
better.

02:29:33.780 --> 02:29:37.940
It's funny, it just cracked me up, because I remember stumbling upon like an edit, you

02:29:37.940 --> 02:29:44.020
know, vault online, and their headline is called, who needs Konami original steps anyway.

02:29:44.020 --> 02:29:48.620
And oh man, the people around the office were ready to throw down with the maker that side.

02:29:48.620 --> 02:29:51.020
But you know, it's all good. You know, we're rich. They ain't.

02:29:51.020 --> 02:29:56.020
Scoreboard. Look at the scoreboard. Our scoreboard says we got paychecks.

02:29:56.020 --> 02:30:01.020
And um, last nephew of the week just goes to work.

02:30:01.020 --> 02:30:04.020
I know, yeah, you guys are thinking, why should I bitch about working at Konami?

02:30:04.020 --> 02:30:06.520
Guess what? I have to work tomorrow for Labor Day.

02:30:06.520 --> 02:30:13.020
And not on a fun game at that. But, that said, you know, that's just a fright.

02:30:13.020 --> 02:30:18.020
You know, I got people who want to spend time with me, you know, I got a lady who needs some lovin' and, you know, what happens?

02:30:18.020 --> 02:30:23.020
I gotta leave her in the morning, man. Like, you know, I'm just, uh, you know, John Depp picked her up and, you know, dumped her off, man.

02:30:23.020 --> 02:30:25.020
Well, what's up with that?

02:30:26.020 --> 02:30:27.020
Huh.

02:30:28.020 --> 02:30:30.020
You know, it ain't really like that.

02:30:30.020 --> 02:30:31.020
Preach it, brother.

02:30:31.020 --> 02:30:33.020
Having to work in the morning sucks.

02:30:33.020 --> 02:30:37.020
Oh yeah, and one last few. Goes to Order of Chaos, actually.

02:30:37.020 --> 02:30:40.020
Sure, you know, people say you shouldn't crack on your own. Well, guess what?

02:30:40.020 --> 02:30:48.520
Ever since he posted that rubbernecking post of all the car accidents, every day I've commuted to work, I've had to be stopped because of, like, traffic accidents happening.

02:30:48.520 --> 02:30:53.520
So he's made my commute, like, half an hour worse every single day ever since he posted that two weeks ago.

02:30:53.520 --> 02:30:58.520
Thanks a whole hell of a lot for nothing. You get no Oreos. Bye.

02:30:58.520 --> 02:30:59.520
Wow.

exhaust all options first before submit error you know subjecting to cable so

02:32:00.480 --> 02:32:03.200
we'll see what happens well cable in Sacramento is just better than all the

02:32:03.200 --> 02:32:07.200
I might want to research that.

02:32:07.200 --> 02:32:11.200
Yeah, it's looking at the internet.

02:32:11.200 --> 02:32:15.200
I created the internet.

02:32:15.200 --> 02:32:19.200
Alright, and um...

02:32:19.200 --> 02:32:23.200
I don't know. I guess that's it.

02:32:23.200 --> 02:32:27.200
Because I can't think of anything at the moment.

02:32:27.200 --> 02:32:31.200
Alright, let's go on to explicit.

02:32:31.200 --> 02:32:38.200
I want to give an F to Texas Hold'em. God damn it. I need some cards that goes at least

02:32:44.440 --> 02:32:49.960
an 8, 9, 10, Jack Queen King at least. All I'm getting is nothing but 2s and 3s. How

02:32:49.960 --> 02:32:54.080
the hell can you win an actual Texas Hold'em game with just those cards?

02:32:54.080 --> 02:32:55.480
Someone's cheating.

02:32:55.480 --> 02:32:58.400
Play 2-7 off suit. Best hand in the game.

02:32:58.400 --> 02:33:04.400
Yeah, but, fuck. I'm not wasting no fucking forty percent.

02:33:04.400 --> 02:33:08.400
Another F.E. goes to my family for forcing me to play the damn game.

02:33:08.400 --> 02:33:11.400
Goddammit, I told you I'm not wasting more money.

02:33:11.400 --> 02:33:16.400
I only play games that I know I'm going to win money on, like Blackjack.

02:33:16.400 --> 02:33:19.400
I get two hundred on cash for getting that.

02:33:19.400 --> 02:33:23.400
Takes a total of them, ah, no wins whatsoever.

02:33:23.400 --> 02:33:30.400
I was trying to just say fuck you to the cars itself for giving me the bad luck.

02:33:31.400 --> 02:33:37.400
And fuck you to some lady throwing a damn beer bottle in my head.

02:33:37.400 --> 02:33:38.400
What?

02:33:38.400 --> 02:33:42.400
I just mentioned this before.

02:33:42.400 --> 02:33:45.400
That's just her way of saying I love you.

02:33:45.400 --> 02:33:46.400
Whoa!

02:33:46.400 --> 02:33:47.400
No, no, no, no.

02:33:47.400 --> 02:33:49.400
Yeah, she wants to share a drink.

02:33:49.400 --> 02:33:51.400
Nothing says I love you like a beer.

02:33:51.400 --> 02:33:59.400
a drink. I got hit in the head right here. Aww, dude. Got hit in the top of my head,

02:33:59.400 --> 02:34:06.880
dammit. You should have been like, aww, you want a drink, huh, bitch? Beer tastes good.

02:34:06.880 --> 02:34:12.400
I was just waving like this. You didn't have to put a damn beer bottle at me. Perhaps you

02:34:12.400 --> 02:34:20.400
were thinking taste great and she really meant less filling. Oh, yeah. That's not a word.

02:34:20.400 --> 02:34:22.400
Alright, anything else?

02:34:22.400 --> 02:34:26.400
F you for some kids pissing on my Toyota Corolla S-Tire!

02:34:26.400 --> 02:34:27.400
What?

02:34:27.400 --> 02:34:28.400
Yes!

02:34:29.400 --> 02:34:30.400
Dude!

02:34:31.400 --> 02:34:32.400
Holy crap!

02:34:32.400 --> 02:34:35.400
You know, waving is the first step to rape.

02:34:37.400 --> 02:34:39.400
She was only defending herself.

02:34:41.400 --> 02:34:42.400
There's a reason why there's porta-

02:34:42.400 --> 02:34:51.740
There's a fucking reason why there's porter potties and bathrooms.

02:34:51.740 --> 02:34:54.860
You can't piss on tires, they don't clean the tires.

02:34:54.860 --> 02:35:04.380
If you do the security up at the rage for breaking up a battle and stuff, and for breaking

02:35:04.380 --> 02:35:08.460
up people freak dancing in there, this guy's gonna have a nice boner by accident after

02:35:08.460 --> 02:35:10.020
some girl's freaking on me.

02:35:10.020 --> 02:35:13.020
There's no fucking way I'm raping her!

02:35:13.020 --> 02:35:17.020
Remember that part about TMI being in the show? Remember that part?

02:35:17.020 --> 02:35:20.020
Raping is a crime, but freakdancing is not.

02:35:22.020 --> 02:35:23.020
Oh, man.

02:35:23.020 --> 02:35:24.020
Alright, anything else?

02:35:24.020 --> 02:35:26.020
Uh, let's just say, dude, be continued.

02:35:26.020 --> 02:35:27.020
Alright.

02:35:27.020 --> 02:35:29.020
There's too much, there's too much.

02:35:29.020 --> 02:35:30.020
Thank you, Sal.

02:35:30.020 --> 02:35:34.020
Uh, do you really want to go there?

02:35:34.020 --> 02:35:37.020
Say what you want, buddy. Say whatever you want.

02:35:37.020 --> 02:35:50.020
Hey, uh, all I have to say is big F you to people who want to fucking, miserable people who have made their lives fucking horrible on their own and want to fucking bring everybody else down because they're fucking immature little fucking pricks.

02:35:50.020 --> 02:35:59.020
You go ahead and do it without us. Go ahead, drive your fucking car off the road and kill yourself because no one's gonna fucking miss you. Don't bring us down because of your shit.

02:35:59.020 --> 02:36:05.520
And I don't need to really go into detail. It's kind of a personal thing, but it's been a fucking rocky weekend.

02:36:05.520 --> 02:36:11.520
And they have to understand, to open a door, it does not require your fists going through the door, but there's a handle there.

02:36:11.520 --> 02:36:12.520
Okay, yeah.

02:36:12.520 --> 02:36:17.520
And yes, goddammit, Diet Dr. Pepper does taste like regular Dr. Pepper.

02:36:20.520 --> 02:36:22.520
No sacrifices here, Rens.

02:36:23.520 --> 02:36:24.020
Yeah.

02:36:24.020 --> 02:36:27.520
Uh, I think we have a segment, or a little subject for a Wednesday show, right?

02:36:27.520 --> 02:36:31.520
Alright, uh, Gypsy Wolf, do you have any FUs?

02:36:31.520 --> 02:36:34.520
It's brilliant. Okay, FU to Sacramento for not having any decent clubs.

02:36:34.520 --> 02:36:37.520
I haven't found one yet, I still have yet to find one.

02:36:37.520 --> 02:36:40.520
I've been to a couple, most of them are either really ghetto or really teeny-boppers.

02:36:40.520 --> 02:36:41.520
Have you been to Paces?

02:36:41.520 --> 02:36:42.520
No.

02:36:42.520 --> 02:36:45.520
If you can put up with a gayity, it's a lot of fun.

02:36:45.520 --> 02:36:46.520
I just haven't tried it yet.

02:36:46.520 --> 02:36:48.520
And there's sexy men there. I'll take you there sometime.

02:36:50.520 --> 02:36:51.520
My car just opened.

02:36:51.520 --> 02:36:54.520
I have not been to a car. I haven't had time.

02:36:54.520 --> 02:36:55.520
Anything else?

02:36:55.520 --> 02:36:57.520
Wait, no, nothing else.

02:37:25.520 --> 02:37:27.580
Blasphemous for me to say it, I know.

02:37:27.580 --> 02:37:29.380
The FU is for the game being too short.

02:37:29.380 --> 02:37:34.620
I'm almost done, over 90 stars, and only at 22 hours, and FU to parties not wanting my

02:37:34.620 --> 02:37:40.740
sexy level 12 thief in Final Fantasy XI to join them.

02:37:40.740 --> 02:37:46.120

Ninz FU to my job and the people I work with,

02:38:13.960 --> 02:38:17.140
the job is getting to be bullshit and people are getting more stupid

02:38:17.140 --> 02:38:20.640
Ninz also says FU to my computer, I had to format earlier and of course there were a

02:38:20.640 --> 02:38:23.300
problems during the format.

02:38:23.300 --> 02:38:27.580
DDR Nemesis says, F you to Floatwalk and Dancer X for giving clues that are too

02:38:27.580 --> 02:38:29.580
fucking hard.

02:38:29.580 --> 02:38:34.540
It would be really easy clues if you had paid attention in school.

02:38:34.540 --> 02:38:40.980
I don't know, the more you scream, the harder it gets. Ooh, there you go.

02:38:40.980 --> 02:38:44.220
Wait a second, isn't that what you told me last night?

02:38:44.220 --> 02:38:45.220
I was just gonna...

02:38:45.220 --> 02:38:46.820
Damn it, you stole...

02:38:46.820 --> 02:38:53.820
I was just going to say it's like sex, the more you relax, the easier it will get, anyway.

02:38:54.820 --> 02:38:58.780
BlackDevilRx says, you know Loki is really a good guy, so F you to the guy who threw

And he says, he also says F you to service pack 2.

02:40:06.660 --> 02:40:10.660
Okay, you need to realize something about me.

02:40:10.660 --> 02:40:14.660

Oh, I'll give John Fields one. FU to Construction on Highways that should have been finished years ago.

02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:59.000
Okay, that's it. No more FUs. We're done with the segment. It's done. It's over. Complete. Finished.

02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:04.000
Alright. Oh, God, that was a long FU segment tonight. Shit.

02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:07.620
shit

02:42:07.620 --> 02:42:11.380
i think we need to talk about some like actual bimani news at this point is

02:42:11.380 --> 02:42:16.980
is there anything else we could uh... bimani news what's that bimani crap

02:42:16.980 --> 02:42:18.860
i forgot what that was

02:42:18.860 --> 02:42:21.940
cuz we haven't talked about it in a long time

02:42:21.940 --> 02:42:23.780
uh...

02:42:23.780 --> 02:42:28.180
well it's not really bimani news but it's dance mania news and as we all know

02:42:28.180 --> 02:42:30.300
the japanese

02:42:30.300 --> 02:42:35.540
Folks always get a lot of their songs from the dance media CDs. There is a CD calling called

02:42:36.220 --> 02:42:39.060
Transparadise it was recently released in Japan for

02:42:39.860 --> 02:42:41.340
1995 yen

02:42:41.340 --> 02:42:45.460
Transparadise tracklist isn't here yet. We'll post it to our website soon and

02:42:46.340 --> 02:42:49.900
In not really related to Bemani per se

02:42:49.900 --> 02:42:54.020
But those you guys that play a lot of video games if you were listening to Wednesday's show you heard about

02:42:54.020 --> 02:43:00.020
Acclaim, the video game publisher for such games as Turok, they went bankrupt.

02:43:00.020 --> 02:43:02.020
Acclaim is gone.

02:43:04.020 --> 02:43:08.020
I remember back in the days when Acclaim was cool, back in the days when we had NBA Jam.

02:43:09.020 --> 02:43:13.020
I say a moment of silence for Acclaim.

02:43:19.020 --> 02:43:20.020
Okay.

02:43:20.020 --> 02:43:26.020
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Did you say a moment of silence for acclaim?

02:43:26.020 --> 02:43:33.020
You know, I have a problem with the volume of my voice. No, I can't do that because that'd be too obvious.

02:43:33.020 --> 02:43:43.020
I liked NBA Jam, it was awesome. You know, I would always kick ass on it, and it was really cool.

02:43:43.020 --> 02:43:49.020
So, I wish that game was still around though, because I think they got rid of it, but whatever.

02:43:49.020 --> 02:43:56.020
Yeah. Anyway, let's give the folks in the chat room another chance to guess at that news.

02:43:56.020 --> 02:44:01.020
I hope someone gets it. I want to play this song. Don't let Dancer X have another victory, you guys.

02:44:01.020 --> 02:44:02.020
You need to get it.

02:44:02.020 --> 02:44:12.020
I will say this. As I was scrolling back through the text of everyone in the chat room, someone got half of the clue correct.

02:44:12.020 --> 02:44:13.020
Like, dead on.

02:44:13.020 --> 02:44:16.020
Dope. But you gotta send it over a private message.

02:44:16.020 --> 02:44:22.020
I mean, as they were thinking aloud, they actually stumbled upon a key part of the answer.

02:44:22.020 --> 02:44:28.020
Alright, well, you better send those guesses right now to Sky in the chat room with your guess.

02:44:28.020 --> 02:44:36.020
Meanwhile, Loki has a song he would like to play for all you guys, and I have to yell at everyone a little bit

02:44:36.020 --> 02:44:42.020
because we've been trying to get you guys to participate by naming this remix in our forum.

02:44:42.020 --> 02:44:43.020
To hell with you people.

02:44:43.020 --> 02:44:49.220
gotten like maybe like two guesses or two suggestions that weren't that great so

02:44:49.220 --> 02:44:53.260
some of you guys said though you were like we need to hear it one more time

02:44:53.260 --> 02:44:57.420
before we can give it a name so fine here you go your last chance to hear

02:44:57.420 --> 02:45:01.820
this mix and give it a name fair enough yeah all right so I already have a name

02:45:01.820 --> 02:45:06.980
if you don't pick one all right so Loki with a remix of radical faith as yet

02:45:06.980 --> 02:45:11.340
unnamed so go to our forums www.orangetownsworded.com look for the thread

02:45:11.340 --> 02:45:16.100
and Bimani discussion and guess and give it a title, whatever you want.

02:45:16.100 --> 02:45:21.300
And Seagurd Rocks, as cute as that was, is not a good remix title.

02:45:21.300 --> 02:45:23.220
That would be for like an Echo Image remix or something.

02:45:23.220 --> 02:45:24.220
All right.

02:45:24.220 --> 02:45:25.220
All right.

02:45:25.220 --> 02:45:26.220
Here it is.

02:45:26.220 --> 02:45:27.820
Anything else you want to say about this remix of Radical Faith,

02:45:27.820 --> 02:45:28.820
Loki, that you did?

02:45:28.820 --> 02:45:29.820
Brand new?

02:45:29.820 --> 02:45:30.820
No, not really.

02:45:30.820 --> 02:45:31.820
All right.

02:45:31.820 --> 02:45:35.180
And again, we're open for guesses, and I've gotten one guess so far from

02:45:35.180 --> 02:45:40.040
Seagurd, and he's guessing, is it Love Love Shine?

02:45:40.040 --> 02:45:42.040
No, this song is not Love Love Shine.

02:45:42.040 --> 02:45:43.040
And you can't guess, you dumbass!

02:45:43.040 --> 02:45:47.040
You should have guessed the same thing you guessed the first two times, because you were right the first two times.

02:45:49.040 --> 02:45:51.040
Alright, here it is. Loki's brand new remix of Radical Fate.

02:45:51.040 --> 02:45:52.040
I want some... no.

02:45:52.040 --> 02:45:53.040
Name this.

02:45:53.040 --> 02:45:56.040
I'm not gonna... I'm just gonna shut up now because I'll just give it away.

02:45:56.040 --> 02:45:59.040
All right, www.orangeletree.com, forums, name it.

02:48:26.040 --> 02:48:56.020
Very sexy from Loki, Radical Phase.

02:48:56.020 --> 02:49:02.020
an unnamed remix, and I gave you guys the URL to post to on our forum, so...

02:49:02.020 --> 02:49:05.020
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm a little loud. Sorry, sorry.

02:49:05.020 --> 02:49:06.020
Yeah, quit yelling.

02:49:06.020 --> 02:49:09.020
Okay, Jamie still has, like, a raging headache right now.

02:49:09.020 --> 02:49:11.020
Alright.

02:49:11.020 --> 02:49:14.020
And explicit as a raging boner.

02:49:14.020 --> 02:49:15.020
What?

02:49:15.020 --> 02:49:17.020
And you noticed.

02:49:17.020 --> 02:49:21.020
Well, no, he was saying earlier in a story that freak dancing is not illegal.

02:49:21.020 --> 02:49:22.020
It's like...

02:49:22.020 --> 02:49:23.020
Raging boner, I don't know.

02:49:23.020 --> 02:49:25.020
It's like, I don't know, remember realultimatepower.net?

02:49:25.020 --> 02:49:27.020
No, sorry.

02:49:27.020 --> 02:49:29.020
This script is awesome.

02:49:31.020 --> 02:49:35.020
Again, as a reminder, please don't send me your suggestions.

02:49:35.020 --> 02:49:38.020
I should say, over private message, you want to go to the forums and post those.

02:49:38.020 --> 02:49:43.020
That link I posted in the chatroom that says suggest here with a big arrow.

02:49:43.020 --> 02:49:45.020
Yeah, click on that.

02:49:45.020 --> 02:49:49.020
Don't talk condescendingly to your listeners.

02:49:49.020 --> 02:49:51.020
I know.

02:49:51.020 --> 02:49:55.520
And now you've heard someone speaking with you.

02:49:55.520 --> 02:49:56.580
Way to go, Loki.

02:49:56.580 --> 02:49:57.760
Way to go.

02:49:57.760 --> 02:49:59.300
You're off our listeners, Loki.

02:49:59.300 --> 02:50:00.660
Way to go, Loki.

02:50:00.660 --> 02:50:01.720
You're off our listeners.

02:50:01.720 --> 02:50:02.720
That's right.

02:50:02.720 --> 02:50:05.720
You know what, Loki?

02:50:05.720 --> 02:50:07.000
Your music sucks.

02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:08.360
You should never...

02:50:08.360 --> 02:50:10.000
That's right, your music sucks.

02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:14.420
You know what, this vacuum sucks.

02:50:14.420 --> 02:50:19.060
Alright, let's talk about the Orange Center radio spinoff shows.

02:50:19.060 --> 02:50:22.920
who always have to plug these at some point during the show. Monday night on our station

02:50:22.920 --> 02:50:28.700
you can hear Diversion, the Bimani remix show. Are you going to do maple syrup shots over

02:50:28.700 --> 02:50:33.260
there, Logie? He has a thing of... Spin off, spin off. He's showing me a thing of Mrs.

02:50:33.260 --> 02:50:37.340
Butterworth's going, Rob, as if like I find Mrs. Butterworth hot or something. Spin off,

02:50:37.340 --> 02:50:42.920
spin off. Oh yeah. Monday night, Diversion, Bimani remixes, 7 o'clock, tune in, love it.

02:50:42.920 --> 02:50:46.700
What's happening on Tuesday night, Jamie? You need to be mixing some Malibu with that

02:50:46.700 --> 02:50:48.700
That happens on Tuesday night?

02:50:48.700 --> 02:50:55.700
No. Tuesday night, pump up the volume. Starring me, the awesome and...

02:50:55.700 --> 02:51:01.700
You know, I went to Game Crazy, and the guy there gave me my official nickname.

02:51:01.700 --> 02:51:04.700
He was asking me what my name was because we were putting in something for some order.

02:51:04.700 --> 02:51:08.700
And I was like, my name is Jamie, the great and terrible.

02:51:08.700 --> 02:51:13.700
And he was like, how about Jamie, the truly awesome and never nice.

02:51:13.700 --> 02:51:14.700
So that's my new official title.

02:51:14.700 --> 02:51:15.700
And never nice.

02:51:15.700 --> 02:51:19.880
I'm never nice. I'm I am officially completely awesome and never nice

02:51:20.840 --> 02:51:22.020
anyway

02:51:22.020 --> 02:51:27.960
My show is on Tuesday, and it's called pump up the volume, and I have a pre-show that starts at 7

02:51:27.960 --> 02:51:30.320
although when I'm really bored it starts earlier than that and

02:51:31.100 --> 02:51:36.620
The show show starts at 730, but because I now have to get my ass up at 5 a.m.. Every morning. I

02:51:38.180 --> 02:51:42.820
My show is usually over right at 1030 unless I'm like really bored, and I'll keep it going

02:51:42.820 --> 02:51:48.240
going. I was supposed to do my show last Tuesday, and I had to do an emergency announcement

02:51:48.240 --> 02:51:54.260
because I had to get my homework done. So, blame my apartment manager for not turning

02:51:54.260 --> 02:52:00.640
on my AC, so I couldn't concentrate on my homework on Monday, so I had to do it on Tuesday.

02:52:00.640 --> 02:52:06.260
As promised, I'm going to be doing overclock remixes, and I'm thinking about marathoning

02:52:06.260 --> 02:52:09.540
another CD. I don't know, maybe Sim and Flow, I don't know.

02:52:09.540 --> 02:52:10.540
Maybe Echo Image.

02:52:10.540 --> 02:52:12.300
The echo image, that's a good idea.

02:52:12.300 --> 02:52:13.700
I don't know, I just, give me ideas.

02:52:13.700 --> 02:52:14.940
I'm dropping the key, oh shit.

02:52:14.940 --> 02:52:15.900
No, you don't got to be doing.

02:52:15.900 --> 02:52:17.500
Oh crap, I just closed the.

02:52:17.500 --> 02:52:21.100
Oh, I think she just out F4'd the chat room.

02:52:21.100 --> 02:52:24.100
That was an accident, I don't even know how I did that.

02:52:25.580 --> 02:52:28.060
And she hasn't even been drinking either, I mean.

02:52:28.060 --> 02:52:28.900
I just.

02:52:30.580 --> 02:52:31.420
Nice.

02:52:32.420 --> 02:52:33.980
Okay, the cam's still going.

02:52:35.060 --> 02:52:38.340
Okay, yeah, if you don't see DarkSakir in the chat room,

02:52:38.340 --> 02:52:39.940
it's all right, she'll be back.

02:52:39.940 --> 02:52:40.940
Where's IRC?

02:52:40.940 --> 02:52:41.940
I think it's over here.

02:52:41.940 --> 02:52:42.940
Okay.

02:52:42.940 --> 02:52:43.940
Well...

02:52:43.940 --> 02:52:44.940
Hey Rob.

02:52:44.940 --> 02:52:45.940
Yes.

02:52:45.940 --> 02:52:46.940
Pick up the flack.

02:52:46.940 --> 02:52:47.940
Quick.

02:52:47.940 --> 02:52:48.940
I'm sorry.

02:52:48.940 --> 02:52:49.940
Yeah, Rob!

02:52:49.940 --> 02:52:52.260
Well, we were gonna go to break, but it's only ten minutes left in the show, so I thought

02:52:52.260 --> 02:52:56.180
actually we'd just go ahead and just kinda skip the break and come back to what we were

02:52:56.180 --> 02:52:57.180
gonna do.

02:52:57.180 --> 02:52:58.180
Wait.

02:52:58.180 --> 02:52:59.180
Wait.

02:52:59.180 --> 02:53:00.180
One more show.

02:53:00.180 --> 02:53:01.180
Huh?

02:53:01.180 --> 02:53:02.180
One more show.

02:53:02.180 --> 02:53:03.180
Oh yeah, I'm sorry.

02:53:03.180 --> 02:53:04.180
Wednesday nights.

02:53:04.180 --> 02:53:05.180
Mikey style, tell us about Wednesday nights.

02:53:05.180 --> 02:53:09.020
Wednesday nights is the night, you know, you're probably like, hey, it's Wednesday night,

02:53:09.020 --> 02:53:12.480
home night you know starting to feel good about the work that week you know

02:53:12.480 --> 02:53:16.280

02:53:16.280 --> 02:53:24.920
radio on live 365 and listen to outside the box because like the name says it's

02:53:24.920 --> 02:53:31.480
quite outside the box even though we talk a lot about boxes I don't know why

02:53:31.480 --> 02:53:36.620
but the main reason why you should listen to show is because I co-host it

02:53:36.620 --> 02:53:40.920
with rice princess you know so it's not just rob all the time because Rob's the

02:53:40.920 --> 02:53:45.740
the queen that always takes over the show you know runs it so please listen

02:53:45.740 --> 02:53:54.140
seven o'clock Wednesday nights we have another guest on the song yeah and I

02:53:54.140 --> 02:53:57.020
definitely want to share something we're almost out of show I really want someone

02:53:57.020 --> 02:54:00.860
to get it so it's an open forum tell the rest for the rest of show send in your

02:54:00.860 --> 02:54:03.860
guesses for the rest of the show and hopefully someone gets it here's what

What's a jazz guest?

02:54:05.380 --> 02:54:08.620
Loki, don't even. You're gonna get somebody in trouble.

02:54:08.620 --> 02:54:10.260
I have a guess. What?

02:54:10.260 --> 02:54:11.700
It's a song. Yeah, it is.

02:54:11.700 --> 02:54:14.740
Uh, Flo Walk. Let's get a Flo Walk mic.

02:54:14.740 --> 02:54:16.060
Okay, lay it on me.

02:54:16.060 --> 02:54:17.760
Jazz is guessing

02:54:17.760 --> 02:54:19.740
nucleus with something smooth.

02:54:19.740 --> 02:54:23.180
There's a cell in the body that does not have a nucleus and the jelly and cream

02:54:23.180 --> 02:54:24.900
cheese on the bagel are both smooth.

02:54:24.900 --> 02:54:27.780
I'll give you something smooth.

02:54:27.780 --> 02:54:28.420
Wow.

02:54:28.420 --> 02:54:33.240
You know, when I said people were onto something, I was not kidding.

02:54:33.240 --> 02:54:40.120
is on to it however he is only half right oh well you got 10 minutes to

02:54:40.120 --> 02:54:43.680
figure it out or else you're gonna go another week without knowing sorry guys

02:54:43.680 --> 02:54:48.360
Rob I think we should just keep playing Gemma Marmalade. Nah just just just don't even go

02:54:48.360 --> 02:54:51.680
there don't even go there cuz you're gonna get somebody in trouble shut up

02:54:51.680 --> 02:55:00.800
all right Loki you're not allowed to talk the rest of the show. Give to Radiskull.

02:55:00.800 --> 02:55:03.800
Let's do some Ask Orange Lounge, boys and girls.

02:55:09.800 --> 02:55:16.800
Let's Ask Orange Lounge, some stupid question. What will we find out tonight on Ask Orange Lounge?

02:55:16.800 --> 02:55:24.800
We're gonna make a jam, and then we're gonna get it on, and hopefully someone will get that clue right about...

02:55:24.800 --> 02:55:25.800
Did you say jam?

02:55:26.800 --> 02:55:27.800
Moving on.

02:55:27.800 --> 02:55:30.800
The show's on something after all.

02:55:30.800 --> 02:55:34.800
Umm, Skypline's open as well, but please don't call if you've already been on this show.

02:55:34.800 --> 02:55:36.800
We want other people to have a chance.

02:55:36.800 --> 02:55:42.800
Well, I mean, I'm just saying that, you know, don't, you know, let's spread the love.

02:55:42.800 --> 02:55:44.800
I wonder how jam shots would be.

02:55:44.800 --> 02:55:47.800
Shut up! Shut up, seriously.

02:55:47.800 --> 02:55:51.800
People are never going to come back to this program.

02:55:51.800 --> 02:55:53.800
Alright.

02:55:53.800 --> 02:56:04.680
Alright, I was going to take some questions from our chat room, but I don't see any questions

02:56:04.680 --> 02:56:05.680
from our chat room.

02:56:05.680 --> 02:56:07.680
Ask your question now!

02:56:07.680 --> 02:56:13.600
Shut up, I swear to God I'm going to clock you with this microphone.

02:56:13.600 --> 02:56:18.040
Hey, don't clock him.

02:56:18.040 --> 02:56:23.640
Alright, Zaku has a question.

02:56:23.640 --> 02:56:30.960
did you spend your summer vacation at work answering 40-plus calls in queue

02:56:30.960 --> 02:56:35.280
from people trying to get student loans to go to school that's how I spent my

02:56:35.280 --> 02:56:46.040
summer vacation next at work supposedly answering calls but it's

02:56:46.040 --> 02:57:03.840
I was supposed to be answering calls, but I was brought on the internet instead.

02:57:03.840 --> 02:57:06.720
Like many of you, I spent my summer not getting laid.

02:57:06.720 --> 02:57:08.360
Luckily, summer's over.

02:57:08.360 --> 02:57:11.640
I'm not included in that.

02:57:11.640 --> 02:57:12.840
I was talking to our chat room.

02:57:12.840 --> 02:57:15.840
Flowhawk, how'd you spend your summer vacation?

02:57:15.840 --> 02:57:25.840
In a room right underneath an air conditioning vent, making step data for Ultimix 2, and I got to do a lot of different things.

02:57:25.840 --> 02:57:37.840
I got to do some writing for Konami games, not just some project I've been on, but I got to be creative, and I got to use the words bitch and whore quite a bit.

02:57:37.840 --> 02:57:41.840
So I think I was entertained.

02:57:41.840 --> 02:57:47.900
someone figured it out finally we have a winner

02:57:47.900 --> 02:57:51.020
thank God we get to play the damn song before the night's over

02:57:51.020 --> 02:57:54.800
you don't say so what's the guess Rob?

02:57:54.800 --> 02:57:58.700
well who got it first of all well the winner is white Rob is the person got it not me

02:57:58.700 --> 02:57:59.940
I'm a white Rob as well

02:57:59.940 --> 02:58:04.940
ho ho ho that's very obvious given your outfit Rob

02:58:04.940 --> 02:58:09.300
and I'm giving him permission to tell our chat room what it is so the next

02:58:09.300 --> 02:58:15.700
thing white rob says to you guys will be the name of the new song god it's about time so

02:58:15.700 --> 02:58:21.380
white rob it's on you buddy a white guy getting he does not have skype he's on 56k so we can't

02:58:21.380 --> 02:58:26.860
skype him but uh white rob figured it out so he just gets to post it in our chat room

02:58:26.860 --> 02:58:30.660
and once he posts it by the way i really like this song watch him get booted i'm gonna queue

02:58:30.660 --> 02:58:37.140
it up so you guys can hear some of it oh but he misspelled it he misspelled it but he still

02:58:37.140 --> 02:58:48.100
got it right close enough. Nucleus. All right, so what is it guys? Let's tell the

02:58:48.100 --> 02:58:50.220
people who are not in a chat room. What is the song?

02:58:50.220 --> 02:58:56.740
Anybody want to say? It's Flo Walk, you should say. The song is by a group called Nucleus

02:58:56.740 --> 02:59:01.540
back from the mid 80s and the joint is called Jam On It. And this is a very

02:59:01.540 --> 02:59:05.260
unique song for DDR. All I can say is this song is a little bit special for

02:59:05.260 --> 02:59:11.260
The only mix of the song I have is eight minutes in length, so I'm gonna only play you guys a clip, because eight minutes is a long time.

02:59:11.260 --> 02:59:13.260
Oh, I'm sure the first, like, minute and a half, two minutes should be good enough.

02:59:13.260 --> 02:59:17.260
So I'm just going to kind of start in the middle here and see what we get. Here we go.

02:59:43.260 --> 02:59:46.260
Rockin' body right back, rockin' speed on the moon, right off the track

02:59:46.260 --> 02:59:48.260
It's the whole wide world of funky time

02:59:48.260 --> 02:59:50.260
Up to the beat, y'all, get down

02:59:50.260 --> 02:59:52.260
Let me rock you to the rhythm of the funky sound

02:59:52.260 --> 02:59:54.260
From hill to hill, above sea to sea

02:59:54.260 --> 02:59:56.260
I went jam ons, rockin' everybody's screams

02:59:56.260 --> 03:00:00.260
Jam on it, jam on it, jam on and on and on and on

03:00:00.260 --> 03:00:03.260
It won't feel a lot, you wanna dance on that thing

03:00:03.260 --> 03:00:05.260
Go on ahead and blow it

03:00:05.260 --> 03:00:07.260
Cause jammin' on is what we do best

03:00:07.260 --> 03:00:09.260
It's what separates us from the rest

03:00:09.260 --> 03:00:11.260
And if you don't think about it, cruise down for real

03:00:11.260 --> 03:00:35.980
Alright, that should give you a good idea of what that song sounds like.

03:00:35.980 --> 03:00:40.540
Many of you guys remember that blast from the past song there.

03:00:40.540 --> 03:00:45.240
Hopefully, Dancer X isn't too upset that, you know, somebody got it figured out, but,

03:00:45.240 --> 03:00:49.320
you know what, that is the longest clue that ever went without being figured out, and so

03:00:49.320 --> 03:00:55.880
for that, we give Dancer a big F-you, buddy, for making our lives hell. F-you, buddy!

03:00:55.880 --> 03:01:01.480
I can't believe they didn't get it after we played Jammin' Marmalade on the Jazz and It's

03:01:01.480 --> 03:01:03.520
Raining Men. I thought that would be like...

03:01:03.520 --> 03:01:07.080
I thought that was completely obvious, too, but I guess people just, people don't think

03:01:07.080 --> 03:01:08.340
we can have any fun with it.

03:01:08.340 --> 03:01:17.340
Like I said, you guys did not have to think very abstract. There was a bagel, there was jam on it, and the bagel kind of looked like a nucleus or something.

03:01:17.340 --> 03:01:20.340
Well, don't blame me. That's probably Dancer X's lame idea.

03:01:20.340 --> 03:01:25.340
Don't explain the method to your guys' madness, you know, or to his madness.

03:01:25.340 --> 03:01:29.340
Our madness is, we give you clues, you suffer.

03:01:29.340 --> 03:01:32.340
Rinz, repeat.

03:01:32.340 --> 03:01:40.880
Alright, hope you guys enjoyed and congratulations to White Rob for figuring that out.

03:01:40.880 --> 03:01:45.440
You all owe him sex, or her, I imagine he's a him though because his name is Rob.

03:01:45.440 --> 03:01:48.940
You all owe him sex for getting that right before the end of the show, just under the

03:01:48.940 --> 03:01:49.940
wire.

03:01:49.940 --> 03:01:53.840
I'll send him some chocolate instead, same difference.

03:01:53.840 --> 03:02:00.200
Alright, I'll buy him one of those blow up pillows from Jlist.com.

03:02:00.200 --> 03:02:03.940
I have to say I'm excited to play that song. As booty as it is, I think it brings back

03:02:03.940 --> 03:02:06.520
solo, everything that was great about solo.

03:02:06.520 --> 03:02:10.560
Well I think this is just showing up, like for UltraMix 2, how eclectic the music really

03:02:10.560 --> 03:02:16.200
is. I mean, you heard everything from like, you know, just sort of like, you heard trance,

03:02:16.200 --> 03:02:20.360
you've heard house, I mean obviously now you're hearing like old school rap, so we're trying

03:02:20.360 --> 03:02:24.240
to touch as many, yeah, you know, break it, we're just trying to hit as many basses as

03:02:24.240 --> 03:02:26.480
we can.

03:02:26.480 --> 03:02:29.000
More to come.

03:02:29.000 --> 03:02:35.720
fun ideas for clues in the future? I don't know we're still working on what

03:02:35.720 --> 03:02:40.160
to do next. All right okay you know what guys it's time to wrap up the show I

03:02:40.160 --> 03:02:44.000
hate to say it but the show's about over here so let's go around and get

03:02:44.000 --> 03:02:47.640
everybody's final thought and for those you guys that didn't get your Ask Orange

03:02:47.640 --> 03:02:51.800
Lounge questions in stay tuned to After Birth we'll get those answered. Let's see

03:02:51.800 --> 03:02:53.800
Let's start with Lankystyle, your final thought.

03:02:55.800 --> 03:02:57.800
Hi.

03:02:57.800 --> 03:02:58.800
Alright, let's go to...

03:02:58.800 --> 03:02:59.800
Oh no, what?

03:02:59.800 --> 03:03:01.800
Oh, I've been drinking a little bit and I feel pretty good.

03:03:01.800 --> 03:03:03.800
Alright, sounds good.

03:03:03.800 --> 03:03:07.800
Let's go to, I guess, FlowWalk, you get a mic. What's your final thought?

03:03:07.800 --> 03:03:12.800
Message over to you, same in the chat room. I got three letters for you. L-O-L.

03:03:12.800 --> 03:03:15.800
And Sharkskroll, your final thought.

03:03:15.800 --> 03:03:18.800
I'm feeling very Jerry Springer here.

03:03:18.800 --> 03:03:22.800
Angel, your final thought?

03:03:22.800 --> 03:03:24.800
I got a present from Loki.

03:03:24.800 --> 03:03:25.800
Yay.

03:03:25.800 --> 03:03:26.800
Yay.

03:03:26.800 --> 03:03:27.800
Yay.

03:03:27.800 --> 03:03:28.800
Oh, the CD?

03:03:28.800 --> 03:03:29.800
Yes, the CD.

03:03:29.800 --> 03:03:30.800
Good job.

03:03:30.800 --> 03:03:31.800
Explicit, your final thought?

03:03:31.800 --> 03:03:36.300
Can you come back to me on that one?

03:03:36.300 --> 03:03:37.300
Can I what?

03:03:37.300 --> 03:03:38.300
Come back.

03:03:38.300 --> 03:03:39.300
No.

03:03:39.300 --> 03:03:40.300
Damn you!

03:03:40.300 --> 03:03:43.260
Alright, Loki, your final thought?

03:03:43.260 --> 03:03:47.100
If I shake my head, I get dizzy.

03:03:47.100 --> 03:03:48.260
He's getting drunk, guys.

03:03:48.260 --> 03:03:53.260
Gypsy Wolf, your final thought.

03:03:53.260 --> 03:04:00.580
Um, whoever's throwing beer bottles at people for waving, keep doing it. It's kind of entertaining.

03:04:00.580 --> 03:04:03.020
My final thought is, um,

03:04:03.020 --> 03:04:09.340
listen to our station a lot and whore up our hours and win in a Curio Mocha CD.

03:04:09.340 --> 03:04:13.220
Uh, DarkSakura, your final thought.

03:04:13.220 --> 03:04:15.900
My final thought is

03:04:15.900 --> 03:04:17.900
I want to go on leave

03:04:17.900 --> 03:04:26.080
like travel but I want to be paid for it so pay me to travel send me to what the

03:04:26.080 --> 03:04:37.900
fuck are you doing with my final thought is I want air conditioning and money

03:04:37.900 --> 03:04:43.960
insects all right we're gonna give Wow Wow no order in that order in that order

03:04:43.960 --> 03:04:45.640
because air conditioning is more important.

03:04:45.640 --> 03:04:46.880
All right.

03:04:46.880 --> 03:04:48.400
The final word of tonight's show,

03:04:48.400 --> 03:04:49.240
I'm gonna give it to somebody

03:04:49.240 --> 03:04:50.420
who didn't say a whole lot tonight.

03:04:50.420 --> 03:04:52.640
Sharks Girl, you gotta give us one word

03:04:52.640 --> 03:04:54.200
that sums everything up.

03:04:54.200 --> 03:04:56.260
The final word of the show.

03:04:56.260 --> 03:04:58.600
Okay, my friend Donna will understand this.

03:04:58.600 --> 03:04:59.440
Beans!

03:05:00.720 --> 03:05:03.160

Oh my god Becky, look at her butt, it is so big.

I like big butts and I cannot buy.

03:05:49.400 --> 03:05:52.400
You other brothers can't deny

03:05:52.400 --> 03:05:56.400
That when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist

03:05:56.400 --> 03:05:59.400
And a round thing in your face

03:05:59.400 --> 03:06:03.400
You get sprung when I pull up top

03:06:03.400 --> 03:06:06.400

03:06:06.400 --> 03:06:14.400
My homeboys try to warn me But that butt you got makes me so horny

Cause I'm long and I'm strong And I'm down to get the friction on

03:06:20.400 --> 03:06:27.400
So fellas, fellas Has your girlfriend got the butt?

03:06:27.400 --> 03:06:34.400
Tell her to shake it, shake it Shake that healthy butt

03:07:50.480 --> 03:07:53.720
A little in the middle but she got much back

03:07:53.720 --> 03:08:00.720

Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

03:08:35.420 --> 03:08:42.420
Alright, here's the afterbirth, the part of the show after the credits have faded to black.

03:08:42.420 --> 03:08:49.420
I got to make this quick tonight because I'm going out tonight, but I wanted to get the rest of these Ask Orange Lounge questions in because there were some good ones in here.

03:08:49.420 --> 03:08:54.420
I didn't think anyone was going to get the jam on it thing. I seriously didn't. Two minutes left in the show.

03:08:54.420 --> 03:08:59.420
It was my drunkenness and saying I should do jam shots that clued them in.

03:08:59.420 --> 03:09:02.820
Seagurd was gonna ask

03:09:02.820 --> 03:09:06.740
Dear Ask Orange Lounge, why can't the chat room figure out this easy clue?

03:09:06.740 --> 03:09:07.860
Well, you got owned, didn't you?

03:09:07.860 --> 03:09:11.740
You got furred!

03:09:11.740 --> 03:09:16.660
Dark Knight says, I got one out of all the drunk shows. What's the record for

03:09:16.660 --> 03:09:17.180
most

03:09:17.180 --> 03:09:21.820
drinks in an episode? I have a guess. Maybe Dark Sakura wants to share.

03:09:21.820 --> 03:09:25.060
Okay, what are you talking about? The time I had like, what,

03:09:25.060 --> 03:09:29.380
10 beverages within an hour? Uh, you think?

03:09:29.380 --> 03:09:33.240
The last trunk show that we did I had four double shots of tequila

03:09:35.140 --> 03:09:39.120
That cheap-ass stuff too and I had half a bottle of

03:09:40.440 --> 03:09:43.500
The mudslide mix the TGR Friday's mudslide. I

03:09:44.020 --> 03:09:49.680
Finished off the rest about that much of a bottle about maybe three inches worth of the bottle of the Long Island iced tea

03:09:50.920 --> 03:09:54.300
What else did I have? Oh, yeah, and I kept making these screwdrivers out of

03:09:55.600 --> 03:09:57.560
Malibu and

03:09:57.560 --> 03:09:59.560
And I kept drinking those too.

03:09:59.560 --> 03:10:04.560
So, I was very drunk, and the thing is, is that where I have really good tolerance,

03:10:04.560 --> 03:10:12.560
that much alcohol in the span of an hour, I ended up passing out on Rob's bed and eating like half of Matt's box of waffles.

03:10:12.560 --> 03:10:14.560
Yeah, I remember that.

03:10:14.560 --> 03:10:16.560
Which I probably still owe you the waffles.

03:10:16.560 --> 03:10:18.560
Yeah.

03:10:18.560 --> 03:10:19.560
I'll get you some waffles.

03:10:19.560 --> 03:10:31.560
Um, tonight I had, what was it, five screwdrivers. Both are, all of them with, um, two shots of vodka in them. So, I guess that'd be ten shots of vodka over the course of three hours.

03:10:31.560 --> 03:10:34.560
Right now, really, I don't feel that drunk. I mean, I'm a little dizzy.

03:10:34.560 --> 03:10:38.560
Over the course of three hours is a lot better than over the course of an hour.

03:10:38.560 --> 03:10:48.560
Well, I didn't want to kill myself, but, you know, um, no, right now I just feel very full because that's, like, a whole thing of orange juice right there. I mean, that's a lot of orange juice.

03:10:48.560 --> 03:10:58.560
What I'm worried about though, Loki, sorry, what I'm worried about though, Loki, is you haven't like, I haven't seen you go to the bathroom in these three hour span.

03:10:58.560 --> 03:11:01.560
You're a time bomb waiting to go off, man.

03:11:01.560 --> 03:11:02.560
Why?

03:11:02.560 --> 03:11:07.560
You drink that much alcohol and orange juice, something's gonna explode, man.

03:11:07.560 --> 03:11:08.560
My stomach, yeah.

03:11:08.560 --> 03:11:10.560
Yeah, all over the...

03:11:10.560 --> 03:11:12.560
No, I've never thrown up from alcohol.

03:11:12.560 --> 03:11:16.560
No, not throwing up, I'm talking about something else. You haven't been to the bathroom.

03:11:16.560 --> 03:11:25.760
I'm not into water sports, so take care of that.

03:11:25.760 --> 03:11:26.760
All right.

03:11:26.760 --> 03:11:27.760
I'll wake up in the middle of the night.

03:11:27.760 --> 03:11:28.980
Why am I all wet?

03:11:28.980 --> 03:11:31.600
I've got to hurry up through the rest of these questions, you guys.

03:11:31.600 --> 03:11:38.400
Zaku, will you be playing drunk DDR and or any Bamani tonight?

03:11:38.400 --> 03:11:39.400
Probably not.

03:11:39.400 --> 03:11:41.600
I think most people are going home, and I'm going to the club.

03:11:41.600 --> 03:11:46.320
Karma Titan says, question number 108, booga, booga, booga, yay or nay?

03:11:46.320 --> 03:11:49.320
Oh my gosh, you guys should have a copy of that.

03:11:49.320 --> 03:11:54.320
If you're referring to Booga Booga, no, I'm not playing any game where I stick a finger up someone's ass.

03:11:54.320 --> 03:11:57.320
I think it was just Booga Booga Booga. I say yay to Booga Booga Booga.

03:11:57.320 --> 03:12:00.320
Booga Booga Booga is cool. Booga Booga is not.

03:12:00.320 --> 03:12:01.320
What is Booga Booga Booga?

03:12:01.320 --> 03:12:02.320
I don't know.

03:12:02.320 --> 03:12:08.320
Uh, Shay23, last question. Any idea when the 8th style limited edition can be bought?

03:12:08.320 --> 03:12:11.320
They're taking pre-orders on Konami style already.

03:12:11.320 --> 03:12:13.320
Taking pre-orders on Konami style already.

03:12:13.320 --> 03:12:16.320
