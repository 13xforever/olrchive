275985	280889	Dude, I nearly got run off the road like three times, but one of them I didn't mind because it was really hot.
283886	284627	No, seriously.
284867	287549	This guy in this big, humongous truck.
288829	291251	And he was just like, hot.
291271	292112	And then I passed him.
293252	294073	And then he passed me.
294793	295814	And he had Alabama plates.
296435	296975	Oh my.
298056	300778	And on top of that, it was Houston County plates.
302559	303880	I was born in Houston County.
304840	305541	Those in Alabama...
307168	311391	God, Dothan, Alabama is where our fucking movie gallery headquarters is.
311792	311992	No shit.
312012	313973	Talk about a hick town, that is.
313993	314794	It's not a hick town.
314854	315655	Oh, it's a hick town.
315975	316756	Have you been there?
316816	317977	Come see our Walmart!

321119	323261	Oh, I'm sorry, they're famous for their peanut festival.
323401	324102	My mistake.
324142	324782	Moving on.
324802	325923	Peanut festival's the fair.
326083	332008	From our sweet southern belle, DarkSakura, to our sweet southern belle, Loki, our tech massa.
332488	334190	I am not southern nor belle.
336001	340682	You're more like a northern... I don't know, wind chime.
340822	341242	I don't know.
342182	343322	A northern wind chime.
343902	344242	Anyway.
346363	347663	Say hi to Loki, everybody.
348063	348963	Hi, Loki!
349563	352224	Also joining us tonight, nobody!
352784	353764	Absolutely nobody.
354264	356145	Oh my god, this is the most awesome thing in the world.
356205	356465	What?
357005	357705	Hi, random!
360305	360545	Yes.
361926	363546	I will go hold it in front of the webcam if you want.
366539	368380	This is the best movie in the world.
369100	370821	Okay, not really, but it's really awesome.
371281	372062	It's rad.
372122	375003	That's one of the two movies I got for my birthday that I ordered.
375724	379946	The first one being rad, the second one being Monster Squad, which hasn't gotten here yet.
380346	384828	That's the movie that had... Wolfman getting kicked in the nuts.
385448	386969	Yeah, that movie was awesome.
387249	389190	It was like, whoa, Wolfman has nards.
389330	389891	That movie was cool.
390051	390391	Exactly.
391351	392572	Anyway, yeah.
392592	393212	Alright, yeah.
395120	398281	Nobody else is here yet, although I hear we're supposed to have like five guests tonight.
398301	401183	I don't know where they're all at, but we'll just kind of wait and see what happens.
401623	401943	I guess.
401963	402803	They're doing better things.
403604	407185	So in the meantime, we'll just sit my new ignition pad up on the couch, and that can be the guest.
407405	410286	Oh, Loki's actually going to wear the ignition pad box on his head.
410446	411747	Yeah, I will wear the box.
413448	415048	All right.
415148	416549	Get a kick out of that on the cam.
416789	421091	We'll be back after this break featuring some music from Desro.
421952	424295	I'm going to try and make it a whole Desro break if I can find enough music.
424335	428400	Okay, that box is really smelly, so I can't wear that.
428541	429702	Jamie wants Desro music.
429742	431384	I'll see if I can find it.
431545	431985	We'll be back.

600124	602085	Thank you for watching!
645450	650538	I couldn't find any other Desro, so I'm going to play this song that reminds me of Desro in a way, instead.
652061	653463	I couldn't find Kobold, I'm sorry.
654465	654745	Sorry.
655045	657650	I know I have it somewhere, but I can't find it right now, so one more.

793861	795502	We finally got some guests during the break.
795522	796323	Hi, guests.

798344	800546	Red Octane Man isn't here anymore.
801316	803677	Maybe Red Octane Man will make an appearance on the cam later.
803977	806498	But we have the Orange Lounge Madam is here.
806578	807398	She hasn't been here in a while.
807578	808918	Say hello to the Orange Lounge Madam.
809158	809678	Pixie Dust.
810178	810919	I gotta go pee.
810959	811659	I'll be right back.
813899	815300	Yes, we have three mics now.
815380	816080	The mic's bread.
816840	817641	Our mics had a baby.
818741	820461	They had a retarded baby.
820881	824202	We adopted a microphone from DDR Angel.
825483	826803	Say hello to Nostylan.
830626	831627	Turn on the microphone.
832047	832387	Hello.
832807	833588	Make the O face.
833828	833948	Oh!
834568	834768	Oh!
835549	835829	Okay.
836209	836829	No silence here.
837249	839871	And Pixie Dust brought me pineapple cake.
840051	841632	Dude, those are so good.
842252	842452	Huh?
843473	844453	Yeah, and I got diet soda.
844953	847575	So I can eat cake and diet soda because that's such a great combination.
849956	850236	All right.
850296	851177	First things first.
851197	853918	I'm going to start off the show by just saying this disclaimer.
854018	859461	If you're tuning in to hear some hint or something for Ultramix 2 or Extreme or something...
860579	861480	Not going to happen tonight.
861520	862221	Sorry, guys.
862861	866284	We don't have anybody special from KDAA here tonight.
867065	867865	Maybe next time.
868166	868546	I don't know.
868646	870067	Hey, I'm fucking special, okay?
870127	871869	But you should listen to us because we rock.
871889	872830	You sure are special.
873070	874671	You're special enough for the Olympics.
875772	876153	Yay.
876233	881998	Listen to us because we're dorks and we make asses of ourselves on the radio for your benefit.
882018	882578	Who's a dork?
882738	883639	I'm a dork.
884079	884820	Okay, you're a geek.
884860	885100	Sorry.
885140	885521	Thank you.
885621	886061	Get it right.
888541	890842	This has been the week for geek stuff, I swear.
891182	892262	All the good games come out.
892402	892823	How so?
894003	894923	Just Silent Hill 4.
895544	896244	What else do you need?
896824	903566	Yeah, well, you know, I went shopping and I picked up lots of good geek stuff that's going to give me hours of entertainment.
903706	907187	I guess this should be a good segue into how was your week, how was your day?
907227	909488	And we'll start it off by hearing from Dark Sakura.
909528	910909	Dark Sakura, how was your week, how was your day?
911369	912649	My week was pretty damn good.
913390	914650	I did homework all week.
915562	923287	I worked all week, but we finally started getting slow because all of the little kiddies who needed their student loans are now happily in class.
924028	925329	Thank God!
927930	940739	So, it's just been, you know, we get a little bit of pick up at work, but other than that, it's just nice and relaxed and we finally get a chance to get all of our crap done and
942651	959826	of course lo and behold the moment we get a slow week I get like five escalated calls that I deal with all by myself because I don't really like to let anybody else handle my business and then I finally picked up my student loan money the saga is over
963044	966165	It's just a whole bunch of crap because ARC is backwards as hell.
966545	969746	So, uh, oh, that's beautiful, Rob.
969866	972206	Rob is putting the ignition pad box on his head.
973587	975027	He is digging for ignition.
976027	982929	Oh my god, it's not mermaid head, it's moron head.
984749	986910	Rob, you been on the sugar or something?
986930	987670	Some caffeine?
987730	988750	Have some Code Red?
988930	990631	I should take a crap in that box.
992819	996343	Okay, excuse me, I was trying to talk about my week.
997324	997784	Thank you.
1000547	1004611	Sorry, I was having a Silent Hill moment and Ignition Pad Head came into our house.
1008456	1008776	Anyway.
1010113	1013175	So, I unfortunately could not pick up Silent Hill 4 this week.
1014276	1018259	I lament over this, but I got something very nice in compensation.
1019300	1026505	Finally, finally, finally, Dimple over here in Sacramento got more of those Stargate box sets in.
1027125	1031268	You know, nice and used, but the discs are all in good shape, so I picked up one of them.
1032208	1032829	And, um...
1034929	1040753	Their used product is usually pretty good because I turn in my new stuff and get money for stuff I got for free.
1042053	1043174	Are you turning in box sets?
1044495	1045535	Yeah, for crap.
1045816	1050719	Like, such as these fine contenders on my table here.
1051999	1052860	Touching Evil.
1054721	1057783	Yeah, it's more Annie crap.
1057923	1060985	Touching Evil sounds kind of... Well, the stuff on Annie.
1061965	1063006	It's like Annie crap.
1063533	1064494	Yeah, that's crap.
1064994	1066515	But it's worth $10 to me.
1066955	1067795	Hey, $10.
1068596	1070717	If ever you get any stuff from the History Channel, then let me know.
1071558	1073179	Okay.
1073439	1074740	I like a good documentary.
1075800	1077521	That's because I'm a big nerd.
1079142	1085166	I've also decided that I'm going to start doing my vocabulary word of the day because I want to increase my vocabulary again.
1086086	1089148	So, I've been looking at dictionary.com a lot.
1090008	1091029	Get one of those calendars.
1092418	1093760	Don't go to Korea Don't go to Korea
1108352	1116578	The other thing I've been doing this week is basically downloading like a mad fiend, getting ready to install my nice, lovely 250 gigabyte hard drive.
1116678	1117399	Ooh, pretty.
1117539	1118639	They rock so much.
1118720	1119400	I have one, too.
1119420	1120221	They're awesome.
1120541	1123383	The only thing I don't like is that it's a Maxter, and I prefer Western Digital.
1123783	1129708	Because, you know, my hard drive that died soon after I got my bio was a Maxter.
1129868	1131009	Mine's a Western Digital.
1131639	1156547	and uh but Dan's lasted for four years and his but his was a master his started messing up when he started doing that image screensaver because he has it on his main cabinet and he started pulling up different name images and it's just it recycled all those images and it keeps pulling from your hard drive so I guess I just wore it out it was spent weird um 250 gigabytes by the way will hold a hell of a lot of porn just so you know
1157341	1158162	Thank you, Rob.
1158322	1163405	I appreciate your informative attention to the content of the podcast.
1163425	1163605	Anytime.
1163625	1164705	That's what I do on this show.
1165106	1166006	I don't have porn.
1166166	1167507	I give public service announcements.
1167527	1171970	That's like 60 dual-layer DVDs of porn.
1172650	1172930	60 dual-layer?
1172970	1174051	I don't have porn either.
1174151	1177693	Why would I save it when I can always re-access the website at a later date?
1177973	1179814	Liar.
1179934	1184237	I save it just in case if I need porn and the internet is down.
1184873	1190337	In such an emergency case like that, I require porn to be on the hard drive at all times.
1190357	1190997	Question.
1192078	1192859	You're engaged.
1192939	1193819	Why do you need porn?
1195160	1198122	As you see, I do not live with my fiancé.
1198703	1199123	Wait a minute.
1199203	1199904	I can answer this.
1200224	1207068	As his roommate and somebody that sees him interact with his fiancé regularly, it's because she is a porn fiend, too, and they watch it together.
1207129	1208630	She is more into the porn than he is.
1209130	1209991	Porn's funny.
1211975	1215858	She came over here the other day and requested to watch the Paris Hilton tape.
1216018	1218160	I'm like... I've never seen that.
1218400	1218841	How bad is it?
1220282	1220802	Again?
1221303	1222564	I've seen it like three times.
1222644	1224085	It's not that interesting.
1224625	1225987	Okay, back to my week.
1226827	1231291	By the way, Janae, I just want to let you know the lighting makes you look naked on our cam according to the...
1232853	1236595	Which is amazing considering she's wearing a pink shirt, yet she's black.
1237176	1239177	She looks like fucking red on the camera.
1239197	1240398	How does she look naked?
1240638	1241858	It's just one giant nipple.
1242639	1245401	Yeah, that's because our chat room has issues.
1245761	1247062	It doesn't even look naked.
1247082	1250864	Okay, I'm turning from the chat room so that I can play with the chat room again.
1251044	1251384	Whatever.
1251464	1252745	Oh, sorry, I didn't know the camera was on.
1254886	1256747	Anyway... Sorry, how was your week?
1256787	1257628	How was your day, Jamie?
1258690	1263371	I'm all pissed off because of the hurricane, because its path is going to go through Mobile.
1266472	1267952	Is that that killer hurricane?
1268813	1275294	Yeah, but by the time it hits in Alabama, it's going to be like maybe a type 2.
1275514	1276775	I hope it doesn't hit where I'm going.
1277495	1284116	Okay, first of all, you're going to freaking Pennsylvania, and I think the last time a hurricane hit Pennsylvania was never.
1285177	1286657	But you're saying there's a chance.
1287230	1288931	No, I'm not saying that there's a chance.
1288951	1290952	What if a volcano erupts while I'm out there?
1290992	1293754	Hey, you're not traveling to L.A.
1294354	1298097	Okay, first of all, there are no volcanoes in Pennsylvania.
1298917	1299197	Rob?
1299257	1300598	There's no volcanoes in L.A.
1300658	1300878	either.
1301419	1304540	The worst you will ever see is a freak blizzard.
1305001	1306201	And it's, what month is this?
1306262	1306722	September.
1307322	1309203	I don't think it snows in September in Pennsylvania.
1309223	1310184	What if there's a tornado?
1311044	1313266	I don't think you'd get tornadoes there either.
1314587	1315247	Okay, Rob?
1315267	1315327	Rob?
1316075	1318616	The hardest thing that you have to worry about is drowning.
1319996	1323538	And I don't know if you're going out over water, so I don't think you need to worry about it.
1327859	1331760	What you gotta worry about is splash damage from any sort of attack on New York.
1331940	1332521	Shut up.
1332541	1341284	Because, I mean, New York is just a target for any, like, mutated monster, alien, space being, terrorist, natural disaster.
1341664	1345025	New York is just a fucking magnet for that shit.
1345700	1348702	So, you gotta worry about, like, you know, stuff going on.
1349002	1350843	Okay.
1351003	1351504	Sorry, Jamie.
1351524	1352044	How was your week?
1352124	1352724	How was your day?
1354706	1356487	Oh, well, it's still my turn, isn't it?
1357567	1357888	I guess.
1357908	1358948	Well, how special.
1360549	1365612	So, I wanted to go see the new Resident Evil movie.
1366133	1367854	Because I love Resident Evil.
1368074	1369875	You and every teenage boy in the nation.
1370315	1371376	And I love guns.
1373197	1374738	I like firearms a whole lot.
1375498	1378160	I like violence and I love seeing zombies explode.
1378781	1382844	This movie's for you, then, because there's about nothing else in this movie besides that.
1383044	1384205	I love violence.
1385286	1387888	I really, really, really dig violence.
1388789	1390450	And I dig good acting, too.
1391270	1393933	Well, then you need to go see a different movie for that.
1394513	1399817	At least they've got people who at least can act their way out of a brown bag and not, you know... And then back into one.
1401639	1404261	But instead, though, I went ahead and...
1405111	1415138	I went to hang out with Iguana Girl yesterday and we watched The Ring, which I love that movie so much.
1415198	1417460	So I'm going to get on this big Ringu marathon.
1417480	1418380	I'm going to watch Ring.
1418561	1419902	I actually watched Ring last night.
1420482	1421523	I need to watch Ju-on.
1421563	1425325	Loki got a copy of Ju-on, which is going to be The Grudge in a couple months here in America.
1425606	1426026	I want to...
1427279	1430761	I guess Ju-on is coming to DVD, which makes sense.
1431261	1433923	Whenever they remake movies, the original always comes out to DVD.
1434583	1438165	But I have The Eye at home and I want to watch that too.
1443648	1448631	I'm just really looking forward to some good movies coming out.
1448791	1450933	I need something random and violent.
1451949	1454310	But hanging out last night, I was all happy.
1454670	1457731	You know, we went out and got chocolate and ate junk food.
1457831	1459371	And I went to the gym yesterday.
1459411	1460591	Was it a slumber party?
1460811	1461692	No, it wasn't.
1461712	1463512	Did you get ice cream and talk about boys?
1464432	1466633	We got ice cream and we did talk about boys.
1466653	1467953	Well, it was a slumber party.
1468213	1469554	It was a slumber party because I went home.
1472235	1476276	We did not play Mystery Day or Secret Shopper or whatever the hell it was.
1476356	1479376	It was a slumber party because if I had went...
1481917	1483479	No twister, we just watched movies.
1483579	1486542	It was a slumber party because if I had win, I would have fallen asleep.
1486822	1487362	You bitch.
1487382	1490285	But earlier than that though, I went to the gym.
1494735	1505021	I am in so much pain today because my trainer decided that my arms need extra attention because I'm not losing size in my arms.
1506001	1511104	So I'm going to end up looking like Terminator Lady in two months and that's going to be cool.
1512825	1514706	People will be afraid of me and I'll like it.
1516727	1517947	Is the cameras up there?
1519332	1520013	See the blue light?
1520053	1520713	See the black light?
1520893	1521294	Good!
1521314	1526738	Yes, we here at Orange Lodge Radio use an iToy as our webcam, because we are that ghetto-rific.
1526778	1530001	Dude, the iToy is a much better webcam than the kind of crap I have at home.
1530021	1532083	I can't even find my webcam turned up missing.
1534705	1536906	As Loki said, it's a better webcam than it is a game.
1539128	1543312	But the rest of it's been me on the hunt for something that isn't crap to listen to.
1543832	1548256	Okay, you can stop fondling the fake boobs on the webcam, because that's just stupid.
1549235	1550736	You have real boobs to fondle.
1550756	1551737	Exactly, thank you.
1552137	1553438	Pay attention to your woman.
1554679	1557221	Okay, I'm done because people keep interrupting me.
1557802	1559343	I forgot what I was talking about anyway.
1560304	1560644	Oh, yeah.
1561064	1562525	I'm leaving in November.
1563926	1564407	Permanently?
1564847	1565067	No.
1566008	1566508	Where are you going?
1566528	1568850	Don't get rid of me that easy.
1568870	1570331	You had me scared for a minute the way you said it.
1570351	1571372	I'm going home to see my family.
1571392	1572393	Oh, well, that's good.
1572813	1575195	I'm going to eat lots of food because it's Thanksgiving.
1576256	1576456	Mm-hmm.
1577111	1582082	And I'm going to be such a lazy bitch the whole weekend.
1582683	1584006	I'm going to go see my daddy.
1585008	1587474	And I'm going to go up to Ozark.
1589329	1591931	You know you're in Alabama when there's a town called Ozark.
1591951	1593732	Are you going to play any DDR at all?
1593752	1594153	Yes, I will.
1594893	1601458	I will go to the cyber station and I will play DDR and leave lots of Orange Lounge Radio.
1602479	1603680	Right on.
1603880	1605241	I'm going to try and do that on my trip.
1605301	1606382	I will wore us out.
1606682	1612387	And if anybody's in the area wants to meet up and hang out, Thanksgiving is off, but the day after is cool.
1612927	1613628	Alright, cool.
1614128	1614469	I'm done.
1615149	1616870	Alright, moving on.
1616930	1617551	Pixie Dust.
1618905	1620285	The Orange Lounge Radio Madame.
1620345	1621106	How was your week?
1621346	1622066	How was your day, honey?
1622766	1625247	Well, it's hot in here.
1626107	1627627	So take off all your clothes.
1627787	1631068	No, because everybody on the webcam thinks I'm naked anyway, so what's the point?
1632229	1634249	Well, my week kind of sucked.
1634489	1638930	I got put on light duty for a case of tendinitis in my right arm.
1639630	1645252	So I had to spend Labor Day at the hospital and then was off for three days from work.
1646092	1651274	and then got to the physical therapy which all they did was put me on ibuprofen and Vicodin.
1651694	1652554	So basically I've been sleeping.
1652814	1653595	I love Vicodin.
1654375	1656036	You know, I can only take half of Vicodin.
1656376	1656656	Really?
1657196	1665599	I lived on Vicodin when I had my wisdom teeth out for a month and my resistance to Vicodin was so high by the end of the time.
1666483	1668024	Real quick, personal reminder.
1668505	1671167	DO NOT PM BIMANIKADE!
1671227	1672728	WE WILL NOT RESPOND TO YOU!
1672908	1673289	Thank you.
1673709	1677992	I'm not on as Bimanikade, I'm on as DarkSakura, but don't send me any private messages!
1678373	1678853	Wow.
1679674	1683137	Loki, you need a lesson in holding the microphone at a good distance away from your mouth.
1685378	1686920	Other than that, the week was pretty good.
1687760	1693625	Went to work, spent time with Victor when he came up, and... Yeah, yesterday, what did we do yesterday?
1694005	1695907	It's probably mine.
1696260	1699402	Joy and Rapture Joy and Rapture, Angel, Dark Child, and Amita are...
1722918	1726459	Yes, I know Anita is coming and she's bringing something with her.
1726819	1728200	I know what it is.
1728320	1728760	I know too.
1729620	1730281	We'll see in a little bit.
1730581	1730861	Anyway.
1730921	1732061	It's bleeding sores.
1732101	1732882	That's what she's bringing.
1733522	1735583	She's bringing her herpes to share with everybody.
1735863	1738024	Everybody's bringing their herpes today except for Jamie.
1738044	1738444	So excited.
1739204	1741365	So, it's been pretty... What about herpes?
1742925	1745006	Everybody's bringing their herpes except for Jamie.
1745406	1748087	Yeah, I went to the doctor.
1751344	1753765	Other than that, we've been pretty boring.
1755106	1755927	That's it.
1755947	1764113	I cannot believe how freaking quiet you are in person when online you are the most annoying fucker I've ever seen.
1764173	1765674	I have not been alive since my woman...
1777701	1778281	I know!
1778541	1779301	Isn't that amazing?
1779662	1783442	The DR community has Pixie Dust to thank for getting Nostyle inlaid.
1785563	1786683	I'll be back, don't worry.
1786723	1787203	Guess what?
1787383	1790444	I learned a trick from Jason just recently, yesterday.
1790524	1792044	That's where we went, we went to Jason's house last night.
1792104	1793044	You want me to show you my trick?
1793064	1793804	Yeah, what's your trick?
1793924	1794265	It's from Cops.
1794285	1795685	I'm going to show you it.
1795705	1796605	A trick from Cops?
1796745	1797625	Okay.
1797665	1798806	Pixie Dust is getting up.
1799966	1801046	Oh, she's lifting her shirt.
1803567	1805807	She's showing off her belly button going, what's up?
1807867	1809328	You know that's on the cam right now.
1812331	1813852	My woman only gets naked for me.
1814072	1818816	I have to give props to the chat room, though, for making a reference to Ice Pirates, because that movie's awesome.
1820637	1821358	Space herpes.
1824981	1825401	Anyway.
1827002	1828083	Anything else you want to share about your weekend?
1828103	1828744	Yeah, I go back.
1829324	1832327	I work tomorrow morning around 7 a.m., and that's it.
1832607	1833648	Back to the Bay Area.
1834769	1837271	Back to my boring old life in the Bay Area.
1838354	1838694	Oh, wow.
1838714	1839635	We got a kid, too.
1840816	1841657	We got our first kid.
1843218	1843718	Uh, what's that?
1843999	1844879	We got an aqua pet.
1846361	1848703	She sings and she dances and she's lovely.
1849063	1850144	It's not a she.
1850184	1850544	It's a she.
1850564	1851525	It's a kid.
1851825	1852386	No, it isn't.
1852406	1852886	It's a she.
1853947	1854427	It's a she.
1854447	1854848	It's a tree.
1854928	1855348	It's a she.
1855368	1856769	We're trying to fix our webcam, by the way.
1856789	1859011	We see it's really dark, so we're working on that right now.
1859091	1860752	At Orangelandradio.com is where the cam's at.
1860772	1861753	It's the shape of a penis.
1862114	1866117	The aqua pet, the actual thing, is like the shape of a penis and twig and berries, basically.
1866237	1866317	Yeah.
1867388	1873930	and the little pet on the inside is attached by strings and whatnot and it does a little song and dance and it's so cute.
1873970	1875931	It's the happy penis of love.
1877592	1879012	It's the happy penis tree sprite.
1879772	1881573	Happy penis tree sprite.
1882313	1884454	And Angel will be bringing her happy penis with her today.
1884594	1885334	Moving on.
1885354	1887935	Okay, I didn't need to hear that.
1888195	1889856	I'm going to go hide in the chair.
1890136	1892757	Since Loki's busy over there, I'll talk about my week and my day.
1892777	1893617	Yeah.
1895569	1896809	My week was okay.
1896949	1898190	It wasn't hugely exciting.
1898290	1902551	I decided to go see a movie as well, but there was no way in hell I was going to see that Resident Evil garbage.
1903031	1908973	So I decided to, as much as I like guns and violence, I decided to go see something artsy.
1909013	1911834	And I went and saw Garden State, and it was very good.
1912334	1914574	And Natalie Portman, very good in that movie.
1914734	1917935	I know a lot of boys out there think she's really hot, and they'll love this movie.
1918055	1918916	Oh yeah, she's hot.
1919016	1919956	She doesn't get naked, though.
1919996	1920236	I hate to...
1920618	1922721	Although she is in the pool in her undies.
1922942	1924263	So maybe the boys will like that.
1924283	1925185	She's very smart.
1925385	1926046	She's very smart.
1926707	1928089	She's very good in that movie.
1929731	1931354	What school is she going to?
1931794	1932155	I don't know.
1932395	1933477	But she's a good actress.
1933517	1934058	That's all that matters.
1935463	1955354	So we did that, and today I finally caved, and I don't know how many people know the story, but I inherited an ignition pad from my last relationship, because when they moved away, they left a bunch of stuff here, and I got to keep it, including third style, fourth style, and a new ignition pad.
1955954	1957035	And it lived at my house for a while.
1957115	1960076	And it lived at Jamie's house, but when I got it back, it didn't work anymore.
1960496	1961497	I don't get it.
1961557	1962477	It worked at my house.
1962577	1963378	I bring it over here.
1964611	1966152	and it didn't want to put out for you.
1987918	1990300	The people at GameCrazy are actually really nice to me.
1990420	1991760	The people at GameCrazy are awesome.
1991920	1993762	So I've been shopping at GameCrazy lately.
1993782	1995122	That's where I got my nickname.
1995783	1996503	What nickname is that?
1996643	2000345	My nickname was Jamie the... What was it?
2000805	2002847	The totally awesome and never nice.
2003967	2005408	I'm now totally awesome and never nice.
2006028	2006308	Awesome.
2007649	2011891	So I got the ignition pad over at GameStop because I know they sell Red Octane products there.
2012052	2014453	And as much as I hate whoring out Red Octane because...
2015228	2017469	Their name is everywhere in the Bomani community.
2017569	2021270	It's like, if you have a Pulse and you play DDR, you can get sponsored by Red Octane.
2021470	2021950	Red Octane.
2022150	2024611	But they really do... This show is not sponsored by them, by the way.
2025111	2026992	Because we don't whore ourselves out for anybody.
2027032	2027512	Yeah, exactly.
2027752	2028292	Except Konami.
2028512	2028672	Yeah.
2028952	2029352	Except for me.
2029792	2032973	But, I have to admit, the Ignition Pad 2.0 is very nice.
2033053	2034854	And it's the only thing I would play DDR at home on.
2035494	2036855	Because I have yet to see anything better.
2036975	2037715	Except the metal pads.
2037735	2038975	But I'm kind of poor.
2039335	2040776	Like, Ignition Pads are expensive enough.
2040816	2042036	I paid $99.99 for that.
2042316	2044397	And then when I checked it out at GameStop, the guy was like,
2045168	2045789	Whoa.
2046990	2048090	He was like Keanu Reeves, kind of.
2048110	2049071	He was like, whoa.
2049592	2050492	Which one did you go to?
2050612	2053154	I've never seen anybody buy one of these before.
2053795	2055216	Like, then why do you have them out on the floor?
2056337	2057838	Where did you, which one did you go to?
2057858	2059099	The Madison Mall.
2059720	2059820	Oh.
2060300	2063703	He's like, I've never seen anyone buy one of these before.
2063723	2066325	If you want to go to where all the cool people are, go to the one that my man manages.
2066345	2067866	Yeah, but I didn't want to drive all the way out there.
2067886	2068507	Eh, it's worth it.
2068727	2074672	And then he said, well, if you're a DDR fan, you want to reserve a copy of Extreme?
2075526	2078027	I'm like, actually, we've already got that taken care of.
2078847	2082149	And then he's like, I'm like, you know, I hear Alter Mix 2 is going to be really good.
2082209	2082949	Like, I'm trying to start chatting.
2082969	2087591	He's like, if you want to reserve any game, man, we got it for you if you want to reserve anything.
2088151	2090712	And then he's like, I still can't believe you're actually buying one.
2091212	2092133	Like, the other one broke!
2094174	2095794	Smoking weed in the back room kills.
2096815	2099856	That's the difference between working for minimum wage...
2102685	2103206	Well, I don't know.
2103246	2107389	California minimum wage is higher than it is anywhere else.
2107970	2109792	And, you know, I've done it.
2110012	2110452	I've worked.
2111233	2113135	But I still bought expensive stuff.
2114156	2122643	I remember saving up for like a month to buy an imported Sailor Moon game back when I was into Sailor Moon ten years ago.
2122864	2127848	Well, the nice thing is that when I travel, which I'm going to be doing for work here for the next two weeks, I...
2128829	2129769	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2159043	2159604	It's a good game.
2159644	2160564	Graphics are awesome.
2160604	2161785	Storyline's really good.
2162666	2163507	Music's great, too.
2163787	2165688	Although I haven't heard a lot of the songs in the soundtrack.
2165708	2167469	I've only picked out like three songs so far.
2167950	2171432	But the way they use Room of Angels in the game, awesome.
2171693	2172093	Awesome, awesome.
2172313	2176776	Anyway, so Silent Hill 4, definitely get it if you like Silent Hill games or scary games.
2177197	2181300	I actually, yesterday, I was sitting here and I was playing and I was in this one level and I got scared.
2181380	2182300	I actually went, ah!
2182621	2183061	Like that.
2183241	2187044	And Loki looked at me and was just like, the hell is wrong with you?
2188889	2189931	Secret says you're halfway through.
2191233	2192895	He was just like, he's all, oh shit!
2193776	2202868	I was like... Anyway, so, that scared the crap out of me.
2202908	2205392	Those little two-headed baby things scared the shit out of me.
2206162	2207864	I wanted to see the wheelchairs.
2208124	2208524	Was that cool?
2208564	2209665	Monsters that burp?
2209685	2212367	I haven't played anything really gross.
2212427	2214389	What's the scene that has a humongous head?
2214449	2215870	Oh, it's the best thing ever.
2226983	2228164	Have you gotten to that scene yet?
2228184	2229885	Because I want to know what scene that's from.
2229985	2230105	Yes.
2257221	2258342	Uh, it's kind of a spoiler.
2258942	2259682	Okay, we'll never know.
2259722	2263564	I can't tell if it's... I can't remember if it was... I think it was Eileen in your icon.
2263604	2264905	I can't remember if it was Cynthia or Eileen.
2264925	2265905	I'm pretty sure it was Eileen, though.
2266625	2269707	But see, that was Cynthia, but... And she was all beaten up.
2270127	2276950	It makes sense for Eileen, but Eileen kind of has a red dress on at one point, so... Okay, I really need to sit down and play this.
2277415	2278195	Sigurd would know.
2278576	2279556	Show Sigurd the icon.
2279576	2279916	He would know.
2279936	2283117	He knows which one, because he was the one who gave me the advice on my text on it.
2284138	2285738	Anyway, Burping Monsters rocked everything.
2285758	2287339	Burping Monsters are cool.
2288800	2288980	What?
2289920	2292701	Are they the ones... What about the ones who come out of the ceiling?
2295562	2297423	All of the zombies kind of come out of the walls.
2297463	2298343	They're scary.
2298383	2300324	They look like... Do they actually go into the room?
2302805	2303665	I don't want to spoil anything.
2303986	2304466	Okay.
2304486	2304786	All right.
2305805	2307310	Anyway, moving on.
2307751	2308193	Just play it.
2308534	2309296	You'll be glad you played it.
2309336	2309718	Just play it.
2310973	2311233	What else?
2311353	2313414	So, Ignition Pad, hello, back to Ignition Pad.
2313474	2315794	I've actually been playing non-stop for like two and a half hours today.
2315834	2317514	I've been playing DDR Ultramix online.
2317874	2322035	And I actually didn't think anyone played this game anymore, but I've been playing in matches non-stop all day.
2322655	2324975	And I've just been having a blast, honestly.
2325015	2326476	I've been meeting some funny people on there.
2326756	2331697	The only thing that pissed me off is that the extension cable for my communicator that came with the Ignition Pad doesn't work.
2331977	2334237	So I'm not able to talk to people while I play.
2334277	2335777	I can only talk before and after matches.
2336057	2339738	But I've been having tons of fun, and I am all revved up for Ultramix 2, honestly.
2340277	2349685	I'm glad I bought the dance pad now because when I get back, Extreme will be out and then I can play, you know, Extreme just fine with the eye toy mode and stuff.
2350045	2350846	I'm sorry, Nostylin, what?
2353468	2355670	Nostylin says you can hear heavy breathing while playing DDR.
2355930	2356751	Actually, it's not that bad.
2356831	2365438	Most people have the courtesy to move their microphone when they're playing, but the ones that annoy me are like when you're playing Colors and then like you hear some little kid going...
2368886	2379069	Blue, the color of blue And then it's all off sync, too.
2380609	2381509	It's horrible.
2381589	2384430	It totally throws me off, too, when the little kids sing along to the song.
2384690	2387551	But I was playing against a 35-year-old mom today, and she rocked.
2387671	2390072	She rocked everything, so that was fun.
2391172	2391712	Moms rock.
2392773	2393353	Yeah, moms are cool.
2394310	2397574	Yes, I'm not going to be here next week because I'm actually leaving for two weeks.
2397994	2398975	I'm going to Pennsylvania.
2399616	2403681	I'm more open this time about talking about where I'm going.
2403701	2404923	You have to go to the museum.
2405503	2405984	What museum?
2406445	2408467	The one on the top of the Rocky Steps.
2409405	2411286	Oh, I'm not going to be in Philadelphia that much.
2411506	2412747	I only go there for the airport.
2413167	2414788	The place I'm at is like an hour north.
2415208	2417269	But I am going to be very close to New Jersey.
2417810	2420531	And I actually went on DDR Freak of all places.
2420571	2422953	And I went on a thread there that talks about that area.
2422973	2426014	And they told me to check out an arcade right on the state line of Jersey.
2426414	2427455	So it's in some mall.
2427475	2428836	So I'm going to check that out while I'm there.
2429456	2430497	And I'm going to try.
2430697	2431197	Take pictures.
2431530	2436515	I'm going to try and go to 8 on the Break in Jersey because they have In the Groove and I'm really curious about it.
2436995	2438557	Take your cam and take us lots of pictures.
2438577	2444362	Yeah, I've been kind of been a little skeptical about it but I feel like I can't really comment until I've played it.
2444622	2447145	So I'm going to play it then I will come home and bash on it.
2447185	2447585	No, I'm kidding.
2448066	2449287	But we'll see how it is.
2449527	2451489	So I'm really curious about that one.
2451509	2454392	So I will definitely probably make an appearance at 8 on the Break next weekend.
2454412	2455332	That's what I'm aiming for.
2455433	2455813	So we'll see.
2457492	2458372	Not that anybody cares.
2458753	2461554	But it really depends on what my lesbian friend from college wants to do.
2461574	2462954	Because she's going to be out there visiting me.
2463334	2463955	And she's the bomb.
2464375	2466336	And I don't know how into DDR she is.
2467896	2472258	I've decided after today, after playing so much DDR, I want to go on the DDR diet.
2472818	2473939	I want to be just like Tanya.
2477760	2480702	Seriously, I'm going to take a picture of my fat little gut here.
2481082	2482782	And that will be my before picture.
2482862	2484223	Look, he's doing my trick.
2484523	2486284	Yeah, I'm doing Janae's trick.
2486304	2486344	Ew.
2487621	2494608	and then I'm going to play Ultramix 2 for like an hour every day and then I'm going to have a six pack and I'll be just like Tanya.
2494728	2495109	It'll rock.
2495589	2497351	Except Tanya doesn't have a six pack, but you know.
2498332	2498572	Close enough.
2498592	2501675	But then Janae will bring the pineapple cake over and spoil it for you.
2501756	2501996	I know.
2502469	2503270	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
2522006	2523066	and gained it all back.
2523167	2524947	But anyway.
2525528	2528469	But see, I haven't really been into DDR for a long time.
2528569	2532110	Like, I mean, I hate to admit that when I've been doing this show for like, you know, two and a half years.
2532911	2535712	And I blame that completely on lack of new arcade mixes.
2535852	2536892	That's honestly what it is.
2536972	2544555	I mean, the home mixes have been great, but the problem is that, you know, my dance pad's been broken for a long time, so I haven't really had an urge to play at home.
2544916	2550418	The arcades in my area suck, so even if I want to go play a mix that's two years old now, you know, I wouldn't...
2551044	2552485	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2576443	2576984	That's right.
2577024	2577764	What was this about?
2578044	2580667	Tell us again.
2580707	2583849	Melody, Shark's Girl, mentioned it last week, but what's this all about now?
2583890	2584750	Give us more info.
2585831	2598122	Someone sent a message on to DDR Freak wanting to do an interview thing for Lifetime Magazine about fitness in DDR.
2598902	2607227	And so she was referred to me and I did a little thing and she said, do you have any friends who were using DDR for fitness?
2607307	2613810	And off the top of my head I remembered Melody because she's got the solo machine and plays the leg weights and everything.
2614510	2616091	And I also talked about Orange Lounge.
2616492	2617072	Yay!
2617832	2620514	Oh my god, we might be in Lifetime Magazine.
2620914	2621994	That would rock so hard.
2623295	2626117	We'd have a bunch of 40 year old women listening to us.
2626137	2626677	Thank you.
2627785	2631829	F you, because I was watching Lifetime last night.
2632169	2633810	Golden Girls reruns, thank you very much.
2634071	2636072	Dude, Golden Girls reruns, that's awesome.
2636152	2638094	Golden Girls is the best show in the 80s.
2640156	2641577	I want to be in Lifetime magazine.
2642218	2644400	Oh, I mentioned us.
2644420	2645040	That's alright.
2645381	2647703	You want to be Blanche on Golden Girls too, what's your point?
2647883	2648383	Shut up.
2649084	2651586	You know, if I were a Golden Girl, I'd probably end up being Sophia.
2652267	2652647	The bitter...
2654173	2655354	I am so Bea Arthur.
2655474	2656355	I am so Dorothy.
2656555	2657135	I'm the bitch.
2657355	2658436	It's what it boils down to.
2659196	2660377	Then who would be rude?
2660397	2661598	This is a sad time.
2662539	2667402	It's a sad time when we start comparing ourselves to the Golden Grove.
2667682	2668243	Anyway, yeah.
2668263	2670404	We need to sit around the kitchen table and eat cheesecake.
2670464	2674227	I think now would be a very good time to go to a break before we... Didn't we skip Loki's week?
2675527	2675828	Did we?
2675948	2676448	Oh, yes we did.
2677249	2677669	Sorry, Loki.
2678770	2680111	He was over playing with the camera earlier.
2680691	2682192	Who wants to hear about his week anyway?
2682662	2683362	Just kidding.
2683402	2683983	All right, Loki.
2684023	2684483	How was your week?
2684523	2684943	How was your day?
2684983	2685364	Sorry about that.
2686644	2688666	Oh, nothing important happened at all.
2688826	2692328	You know, it's nothing at all boring.
2692848	2696571	Happy birthday to you.
2696591	2700153	Don't feel bad.
2700193	2702034	I had a disaster on my birthday, too.
2702294	2702834	Wait, I'm sorry.
2702914	2707657	I actually would like to have a moment of silence for September 11, 2001, when Loki turned 21.
2712335	2712595	All right.
2714036	2717459	Okay, don't feel bad because the whole Waco thing was on my birthday.
2720462	2722484	Yeah, but those are just crazy people in Texas.
2724786	2726867	Thousands of people died in my birthday.
2726928	2727488	That's cool.
2727648	2729630	How is that cool?
2729650	2730310	Not cool.
2730711	2731151	Yeah, whatever.
2731351	2732793	It's like a sacrifice for Loki.
2732813	2735855	You're just pissed off that no one died in your birthday.
2736896	2740099	I'm so glad we could have someone controversial on this program.
2742543	2745025	Lots of people died on everybody's birthday.
2745405	2746907	People die.
2747647	2750289	It happens on a daily, every day.
2750750	2753151	Hundreds of thousands of people die.
2753172	2756614	When you celebrate your birthday, eat some damn cake.
2756934	2758015	I didn't eat cake.
2758095	2758956	I had ice cream.
2759877	2761478	I'll give you some damn cake.
2762039	2762899	I don't want cake.
2764741	2769705	Anywho, no, um, so, it's just, uh, yeah, I didn't do much.
2769765	2770065	I got
2770771	2772012	What did I get for my birthday?
2772132	2773752	I got bedding for my birthday.
2773772	2778435	I got pillows, new sheets, and a shaver.
2779155	2780115	No one bought you socks?
2781236	2786879	No, that was Christmas.
2786919	2792481	I'll get into later what happened more that day, but things didn't happen that I wanted to happen.
2792861	2793762	Actually, I'll just say it now.
2794122	2799044	I didn't get to go to Benihana's because they're assholes, but I'll talk about that later.
2799084	2800125	Isn't this coming up in the FU's?
2800686	2801586	I'm sure it will be.
2803087	2810230	I wanted my goddamn teriyaki steak and shrimp instead of I was forced to have Olive Garden, but that's okay.
2811770	2812251	That's all.
2812571	2813771	I didn't really have much to say.
2816172	2817773	Alrighty then, I think we'll go to a break now.
2819514	2824295	And then we'll come back and we'll talk about some DDR stuff and have our cage match and FUs and all that fun stuff we usually do.
2825216	2828157	And hopefully Anita and them will get here soon because I want to see what that's all about.
2828991	2830852	I haven't talked to Dark Child in a long time either, so.
2830872	2833894	Yeah, because his milkshake brings all the boys to the yard.
2834154	2837916	Alright, in this break, in this break, you get Korean music.
2838637	2839677	Woohoo!
2839777	2840738	You better play Faith.
2841618	2842659	That's actually going to kick it off.
2842939	2843400	We'll be back.
2852447	2853927	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2896192	2898613	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft,

3071313	3073254	Darian, Darian, Darian, Darian

3182478	3186579	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3264375	3270198	Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio Because real radio makes Captain Jack cry
3274707	3275027	Lizenka, Save Us
3301676	3305519	Yeah, Sigurd, I'm in the Send It To DarkSakura SSF.
3305719	3306360	I'm in there right now.
3308502	3308782	All right.
3309022	3310163	Dude, SCTV.
3311624	3317769	Anyway, we had some folks join us during the break, so I thought we'd go ahead and let them have a second chance.
3317790	3318330	How was your week?
3318370	3318870	How was your day?
3318890	3320011	So you can get to know them a little better.
3320332	3322714	And we'll start off with DDRcaholic.
3323915	3324695	Oh, my gosh.
3324715	3325516	I'm not ready for this.
3326297	3326937	Hi, everybody.
3327097	3327398	Hi.
3327478	3327558	Hi.
3328396	3328917	My week.
3329037	3331119	My week is not very eventful usually.
3331340	3332221	I do a lot of working.
3332521	3333642	So, got that done.
3334984	3336045	Yesterday... Oh no.
3343727	3345969	Dark Child is showing you funny things on the camera now.
3346209	3347370	At least he's trying.
3348531	3349371	What did we do yesterday?
3349692	3352794	We had a little impromptu get-together last night.
3353114	3355456	Yeah, a bunch of us were over at my place.
3355516	3358438	I wanted to come, but I was on my period, so I'm sorry.
3358858	3361520	I was too, so... Suck it up and get the tampons.
3364322	3365043	No, seriously, though.
3365063	3368685	It's our apartment, mine and Jason's.
3370006	3370847	Excuse me.
3372534	3377178	And we watched one episode, episode two of Beautiful Life.
3377659	3381742	And we just had lots of salmon noodles and snacks and stuff.
3382162	3383924	Lots of fun.
3384984	3386225	Crab, kimchi, crab.
3386265	3386766	I can talk.
3387446	3388567	Cream cheese wontons, yes.
3389468	3392650	And that was really the highlight of my week so far until I got here today.
3392951	3393311	Right on.
3393511	3393791	Yeah.
3394172	3397374	Now, I understand that you have a special presentation.
3397394	3399496	You want to do it next after we finish off?
3400482	3401483	Yeah, let's finish off.
3401523	3402224	Yeah, okay.
3402364	3404546	Let's finish this off, and then we'll get into a special presentation.
3404566	3405146	Yeah, finish it off.
3405366	3405627	All right.
3406247	3406708	Angel.
3407328	3407608	Hi.
3407809	3408409	How was your week?
3408429	3408929	How was your day?
3409170	3414654	Basically just school and working, and oh, we signed up for High Speed finally.
3415195	3415875	It's about time.
3416296	3418197	Hey, like it was my fault.
3418758	3422861	Yeah, so we should get it like tomorrow or Tuesday, so I'm like really stoked about that.
3422881	3427025	I'm like, finally, after two months, I can actually be back on High Speed.
3427577	3432941	which means I can play Ragnarok with Jamie and probably Final Fantasy XI with you too.
3432961	3433422	Yay!
3433442	3434603	Uh-oh.
3435063	3436464	I feel an A word coming on.
3438646	3439327	Oh, great.
3439447	3440288	Oh, yeah.
3440328	3446313	I also got the PlayStation Xbox converter thing so I can use my ignition to play... Look what I bought today.
3446333	3446833	I know!
3447534	3449075	I just saw that and I'm like, oh, that reminded me.
3450236	3451457	Janae, what are you doing with the camera?
3452237	3454960	I think this calls for another appearance of Ignition Pad Man.
3455120	3456341	Oh, no, it's Ignition Pad Woman.
3457296	3461119	Your newest Silent Hill character, Ignition Pad Headman.
3462320	3465923	Alright, so yeah, I can play Ultramix now with a pad.
3466123	3467865	And what the hell is Janine doing?
3468065	3469806	She's Ignition Pad Woman.
3470086	3470907	Roar!
3471407	3473829	Yeah, it smells like plastic in there.
3474090	3477612	You should have seen the Ignition Pad when we unwrapped it.
3477732	3479254	It had that new pad smell.
3479374	3480815	Oh my god, it's Ignition Totoro!
3480855	3482476	Wait a minute.
3482917	3483577	Alright, I'll shut up.
3483917	3484398	Who's next?
3485218	3485859	Dark Child's next.
3490817	3492618	My week was uneventful.
3493098	3494218	I have a back injury.
3494359	3495479	I don't get to do much.
3496139	3497780	Monday I saw my chiropractor.
3498460	3500160	Wednesday I saw my chiropractor.
3501021	3502821	Friday I saw my chiropractor.
3504542	3507503	That's about all I do now is I see my chiropractor.
3508003	3509063	It's very boring.
3509183	3509743	Very, very boring.
3511929	3512589	Wow, my week is exciting.
3512629	3512949	So exciting.
3512989	3514170	You forgot one thing, though.
3542403	3542644	What?
3542905	3544450	Your trick that you taught me.
3545172	3545634	Which trick?
3547557	3550078	Maybe it's like the whole Japanese expression to split your gut.
3550098	3550198	Maybe.
3550218	3550798	Maybe it's like that.
3578037	3581440	I don't think the idiots would have caught on with the Japanese expression.
3581540	3582520	These are the ghetto people.
3583281	3584682	That's like, show your gut.
3586323	3586763	That's it.
3587003	3589285	I'm very boring now.
3595535	3600017	Okay, now that we've caught up everybody on how was their week, how was their day, let's have Anita.
3600117	3601578	Anita wants to do a special presentation.
3601618	3603399	DD Archaholic has a special presentation.
3603659	3605000	Tell us about your special presentation.
3605360	3607521	Well, this is all about yesterday.
3608261	3610723	Everyone knows about what special day yesterday was, right?
3610743	3612003	Yes, do this on the cam, please.
3612103	3613464	Okay.
3613524	3615105	Yesterday was 9-11 day.
3619407	3620768	I'm glad the mic didn't pick that up.
3621987	3625270	and I have prepared a gift basket for the birthday boy.
3625550	3627192	Oh, birthday boy, you'll get your gift basket.
3627472	3628733	Here's our gift basket.
3628773	3631596	Yes, do it in front of the webcam, please, and hold up each item so our chatters can see.
3631616	3632136	Okay, here we go.
3633077	3645347	All right, here's a little... All right, in this gift basket, we have a collection of Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen items, starting with a Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen DVD.
3645567	3646088	It's called...
3646644	3647644	Greatest Parties.
3648065	3652906	It's one of their younger DVDs where they're probably only about 12 years old, I think.
3653326	3663110	And also there's a graphic novel that somewhat resembles the adult reading that you might find.
3663950	3665151	There is a little porn here.
3665211	3673033	We have a calendar and in this calendar, for the month of September, you may find a little surprise.
3675464	3680305	Something that may not be viewable on the webcam.
3680725	3682625	But we have Mary Kate and Ashley.
3682806	3686106	Ashley finally got naked for the camera.
3686546	3687086	Finally.
3688127	3690347	Especially for Matt for September.
3690387	3691507	They got very naked.
3692548	3695208	And also, actually, they got a little frisky in October.
3696008	3700229	So, October, the Halloween month, some more surprises for you.
3700969	3704550	Also in the gift basket, we have a small bottle of KY Jelly.
3706970	3713335	that is for any intimate moments that you may need and a tube sock to accompany those intimate moments.
3715437	3727667	We also have a bag of candy so that you can lure any other young individuals that you may want to accompany you and a small bottle of Jack Daniels that will also help relax the children.
3729949	3731530	In a Michael Jackson sort of way.
3731650	3733812	You forgot to put the label Jesus Juice on there.
3738605	3745708	and a small package of brush-ups, Oral-B brush-ups for brushing yourself off or the kids when they're finished.
3745728	3748509	That is the most awesome birthday gift I've ever seen.
3748569	3749649	Molester in a box.
3750289	3750909	That's the best.
3751950	3753690	It was from the pedophile section at Walmart.
3754451	3755931	That was fucking hilarious.
3755951	3756931	That was great.
3757452	3757932	Thank you.
3758852	3763534	You know, I think those super-Christians at Walmart would be pissed off if they saw what you actually did with their products.
3764994	3766455	So happy birthday, Matt.
3770173	3771674	Oh, they're very happy.
3773954	3780796	This week and Naked Mary-Kate and Ashley this week.
3780836	3781697	That's great.
3781737	3782317	Thank you, guys.
3782677	3789599	I'm actually going to open up the Skype line for birthday wishes or if you want to respond to anything we've talked about in the show so far as well.
3789619	3790719	So Skype line is open.
3791299	3794640	For more information, www.OrangeLawnsRadio.com.
3794960	3797141	Click on that little button that says Interact With Us.
3797819	3800181	And you can reach out and touch someone right here in the studio.
3802703	3803023	Alright.
3804725	3809769	Hope you guys enjoyed that on our webcam over at www.orangeloungeradio.com You know what?
3810329	3810709	You know what?
3810769	3812331	We haven't heard from someone in a little bit.
3812591	3812811	Who?
3815833	3816574	Alright, let's take a call.
3816594	3817415	We got a call coming in.
3817695	3819196	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3822178	3822959	Can't hear you, buddy.
3823940	3824861	Talk loud into the mic.
3826021	3826401	Hey, what's up?
3826421	3827842	It's me, the legend of Zaku.
3827982	3828623	What's up, Zaku?
3828663	3833066	Yes, this is kind of like directed to Loki, because I lived through the hell of September 11th.
3833606	3836548	Hold on, he's laughing at the porno calendar.
3836608	3837149	Hold on a minute.
3837509	3839370	Zaku has something he wants to say to you, Loki.
3840291	3841011	Alright, Loki.
3841371	3847255	Since you basically, you know, I don't know, for some reason, I kind of like feel almost offended, but not all the way.
3848156	3849317	For the fact of the matter...
3850130	3851572	I am an actual New Yorker.
3851712	3853413	I've lived for 11.
3854034	3855936	My school was evacuated on that day.
3856076	3858918	I managed to get a glimpse of the towers while they were crumbling.
3861100	3865565	So, in other words, just be respectful, sensitive, all that.
3866005	3868627	Celebrate your birthday, but keep in mind of what happened.
3869208	3869608	That's all.
3869969	3871510	So you were only halfway offended?
3872671	3873132	Halfway?
3873192	3873852	Not like, what, 25%?
3874052	3875674	You're not trying hard enough!
3876258	3876798	Oh, please.
3876818	3877339	As you live through...
3891949	3903774	We are equal opportunity offenders here on the radio, and the way that some of us deal with crisis, like I'm the type of person that laughs at a funeral, and I would hope that people bring a stand-up comic to my funeral, because I want people to laugh when they remember me.
3903894	3911517	So, you know, obviously it was a tragic day, but sometimes the best way to work through something is to make fun of it.
3911537	3912438	I'm not totally offended.
3912618	3912898	All right.
3913921	3914761	We'll work on that.
3915581	3917462	Just a little pointer.
3918042	3919722	Just be a little sensitive, that's all.
3919842	3922523	We'll work on the totally offensive thing for a later date.
3923883	3926103	Anything else you want to share with us, Zaku?
3926123	3928784	Can you at least bash Bin Laden or something?
3928824	3931664	Do some bashing against those people.
3931684	3932905	Oh, that's so used, though.
3933005	3933865	That's so trendy.
3933945	3935345	Everybody bashes Bin Laden.
3936145	3937125	I'll bash Bin Laden.
3937685	3940386	Goddamn Bush family, forgive Bin Laden, my friend.
3940734	3942915	President Bush should be killed and his entire family.
3942935	3944617	If it wasn't for them, Osama wouldn't live.
3945777	3946678	Thank you, Dark Child.
3946738	3947138	All right.
3947639	3948679	Was that acceptable?
3949840	3953162	Actually, you could... Whatever.
3953222	3953542	I know.
3953923	3954583	I'll let it go.
3954963	3955203	All right.
3955223	3955984	We're going to let you go, bud.
3956004	3960227	We're going to let you go, bud.
3960247	3960707	Have a good one.
3961708	3964169	I know what we're going to do when Loki kicks the bucket.
3964349	3964710	What's that?
3964750	3966491	We're going to stuff a mountain somewhere.
3966511	3966871	Stuff?
3967557	3972359	We're going to take him to a taxidermist and put him in one of those poses.
3974360	3977142	Or put him up with some laminated bacon or something.
3977222	3982864	Loki is the type of person that when he dies, he's going to want to be buried face down so the whole world can kiss his ass.
3984285	3985986	Okay, I know where that came from.
3986346	3987467	No, no, no, no, no.
3988367	3991769	I would have to be ground up and thrown into some sort of fast food.
3993529	3994510	Or just recycling.
3995737	4001261	Or my ashes could, like, I don't know, be used in a charcoal, you know, grill or something.
4001722	4003463	Wasn't that in an episode of Married with Children?
4003683	4004263	Yes, it was.
4006024	4007285	Skypline's still up on everybody.
4007405	4008346	Oh, and we're getting a call.
4009287	4010507	Howdy, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4011408	4012209	Hey, this is Dark Knight.
4012489	4013530	Hey, Dark Knight, what's on your mind?
4013570	4014090	Hi, Dark Knight.
4015151	4017092	Just something for Loki about his B-Day.
4017592	4018153	Yeah.
4018313	4018913	Dude.
4020495	4021135	The calendar.
4022016	4023576	The calendar was awesome, wasn't it?
4024957	4026198	That was just totally wrong.
4026618	4029339	DDArcoholic actually gets the credit for the calendar.
4029439	4034221	She spent her hours photoshopping that and making it, or however she did it, with scissors and tape.
4034261	4034621	I don't know.
4035302	4039263	She did a good job, but dude, step away from the calendar.
4039303	4040164	That's all I got to say.
4040284	4041184	We're all going to hell.
4041264	4041845	What can we say?
4042905	4043665	We'll see you there, bud.
4044326	4045546	Welcome to the handbasket.
4046487	4048528	Soon enough, we won't have to photoshop that.
4048808	4049328	Soon enough.
4049870	4052512	It's a matter... It will be within my last time.
4052612	4054654	In fact, it will be within the next few years.
4054914	4055214	Okay.
4055895	4056415	Soon enough.
4057736	4058296	Hey, Dark Knight.
4058416	4058797	It's Angel.
4060358	4060878	Oh, we hung up on him.
4061038	4061839	Oh, never mind.
4061879	4063020	I'm just saying hi to him anyway.
4063560	4065041	He'll probably say hi in the chat room anyway.
4066082	4067603	Okay, I have one thing to say to Loki.
4068364	4069485	A night with Mary-Kate.
4070085	4070205	Oh!
4075389	4076130	You know what?
4076230	4076430	What?
4078712	4079032	I just...
4079921	4080662	DarkSakura.com
4090512	4092473	I have the same hatred towards DarkSakura and I like it
4120056	4123698	You know, Loki, Hugh Hefner already has pictures of them in his private collection.
4124219	4126080	It's just a matter of time before they get published.
4128121	4129362	It's all about time.
4130182	4130542	Anyways.
4132403	4134765	So yeah, that game with the arrows and the stomping.
4135365	4136406	Yeah, to DDR.
4139025	4141107	What game is that?
4141988	4142849	We'll get to it in a minute.
4143230	4148936	Zaku's calling back, even though I usually don't take calls twice from the same person in a show, I'll give him a second chance.
4148996	4149657	Alright, what's up?
4150698	4154823	Alright, I have an idea for when Loki passes to the next world.
4155211	4155911	All right.
4156251	4158912	Well, why don't you just bury him upside down in the casket?
4159413	4170517	And then just, you know, after he's buried, you just go that night to the cemetery, dig up his corpse, and then take it back to your place, throw it around, put, like, panties on it, high heels, dance with it.
4170877	4171617	And then fuck it!
4171637	4173758	That's too much work.
4173778	4175279	Dude, that is fucking awesome.
4175479	4181161	I want you to re-dig me up when I'm dead, and then just, like, put me in a Hawaiian shirt with glasses, like Bernie.
4181181	4183082	That is fucking awesome.
4183602	4187145	We're going to bury Loki in bra and panties.
4189708	4190989	Alright bud, thanks for the call.
4192971	4194552	Oh, I missed the other guy that was calling in.
4197214	4200878	Darn it, call back person that was trying to call because we just missed it.
4201298	4204241	Knowing Loki, he'd probably dig his way out of his own coffin anyway.
4207023	4208765	He's too stubborn to die.
4209908	4210849	Too mean to die.
4216632	4217013	Alright.
4220315	4222856	Yeah, I'm a little upset with Rice Princess and Lanky Style.
4222896	4224217	I thought they were going to be here tonight.
4224397	4224877	Bitches.
4225098	4229100	They were supposed to bring me that copy of Harvest Moon so I could take it to Pennsylvania.
4230221	4230801	Bitches.
4231261	4231722	That's alright.
4232022	4232702	It's alright, Angel.
4232722	4233523	I'll play it when I get back.
4234884	4236885	We'll just have to work it off Rice Princess's ass.
4238021	4239502	I'll do that on Tuesday.
4239602	4241123	Alright, sounds hot.
4243025	4245366	I'm waiting to see if that person calls us back on Skype.
4245386	4246307	Should I just call them?
4247168	4247508	Why not?
4247528	4247888	Go for it.
4247988	4249750	Alright, I'm just going to call them.
4249930	4251111	Oh, they're calling back.
4251171	4252292	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge.
4254873	4255194	Hello.
4256074	4257035	Hello, how's it going?
4257155	4257876	Hi, who's this?
4258536	4258976	El Mullet.
4259197	4260878	Hello, El Mullet, how are you?
4260918	4261038	Hello.
4261542	4262423	I'm doing good, Sky.
4262463	4263164	How about yourself?
4263244	4263565	Good.
4263825	4266909	Hey, I was playing El Mullet earlier today on DDR Ultraman.
4266949	4269332	El Mullet has the coolest nickname ever.
4269973	4271595	Because, you know, the mullet's making a comeback.
4272236	4272576	It totally is.
4272596	4273017	Oh, yes, it is.
4273277	4276020	And the funniest thing is, I'm not Mexican, and I don't have a mullet.
4277442	4278023	So why the name?
4279215	4279675	I don't know.
4280455	4281696	It was on Bimani style.
4281716	4291199	There was like on the umpteenth ask a stupid question, get a stupid answer thread, and it's like, what if the mullet would make a comeback?
4291219	4293460	And I'm saying, yes, I always wanted to grow a mullet.
4293820	4294420	No, I don't.
4296081	4297522	What if I really wanted to grow a mullet?
4297602	4301863	And then someone replied, well, you'll grow one, and then we'd call you El Mullet.
4302884	4303984	And thereby hangs the tale.
4304540	4306422	People get their nicknames in very strange ways.
4306602	4307743	Next on Reading Rainbow.
4330129	4335632	and then we got into another match and it was the same freaking song and I triple-a'ed it and beat him.
4335732	4336633	I triple-a'ed it on a pad.
4336653	4337153	I was so happy.
4338173	4340915	Granted, it was a light song, but hey, I'm still cool.
4341535	4342916	You may or may not get to play with me this week.
4343056	4345357	As we all are in our own little internet way.
4345618	4347038	I may not because I'm going to Pennsylvania.
4347118	4347679	Anyway, I'm sorry.
4348699	4349960	Why did you call us tonight anyway?
4350788	4355209	I just wanted to say that this show is probably the most screwed up show I've ever listened to.
4355369	4356589	Thank you.
4356909	4357869	That is such a compliment.
4357909	4358249	Thank you.
4358269	4359430	That really warms our hearts.
4359530	4362810	Actually, El Mullet likes to plug our little show on a site of his.
4363470	4367351	So would you like to plug your site here on our show, El Mullet?
4367371	4367871	Yes, I would.
4368671	4377033	www.insidepulse.com It's an entertainment website with a bunch of different areas, video games, movies, TV.
4377053	4377933	Is there an adult section?
4378760	4379661	No, but there's Rasslin.
4379981	4380422	Cool!
4380462	4381543	Yes, there's Rasslin.
4381643	4383525	Cool, my favorite male soap opera.
4385707	4387549	I tip my diet chocolate soda to you.
4387710	4390152	And you can read the cookie story on this site.
4390332	4393416	El Mullet was the one that sent the cookies, which we talked about a couple weeks ago.
4394136	4396699	Yes, I will be forever heralded as the Cookie Man.
4396739	4397520	The Cookie Monster!
4397880	4400343	Alright.
4403211	4409113	And the most hilarious thing is, as soon as I hang up, I can listen to what I just said on Thanks to Lag.
4409433	4410694	Oh, I know, it's great.
4411014	4413175	Hey, actually our chat room wants to know, are you high?
4413195	4414875	Am I high?
4415115	4417676	You sound really laid back.
4418957	4423598	Well, I figured if I sounded like a nervous, prissy bitch... He's the mullet, dude!
4423918	4425039	He's the mullet!
4425099	4427100	We'll make sure there should be that box of Twinkies.
4427160	4428000	Mullets are laid back.
4428504	4432027	I know that no silence sounds really like he's high all the time.
4432227	4438013	Actually, we may be shipping something to El Mullet soon because El Mullet would be eligible to win our contest.
4438333	4439994	Did you know we're having a contest, El Mullet?
4440375	4441596	You're having a contest?
4441616	4441676	Yes.
4441796	4445980	Actually, we haven't announced this to anybody yet, but we're going to right after the break.
4446611	4447812	You better stay tuned.
4447932	4449332	It is a huge contest.
4449772	4451893	Multiple websites are involved in this contest.
4452013	4452573	Coming together.
4452853	4453474	It's going to be hot.
4453794	4455034	So hot.
4455094	4458175	It's just going to be too hot for normal radio.
4458295	4458956	That's why it's here.
4459516	4463397	You will need new pants after you hear about this contest.
4464558	4465738	Thanks for the call, Mullet.
4466118	4466799	We appreciate it.
4466999	4469580	And we hope to hear from you again soon, bud.
4469620	4472061	And I'm going to kick your ass when I get back from Pennsylvania.
4472681	4473561	Don't!
4474521	4474822	Later.
4474862	4475062	Bye.
4476926	4478208	Alright, we're going to close the skyline for now.
4478228	4479129	We're going to go to a break.
4479850	4486018	And in this break, there should be a little bit of a hint on what this contest is all about.
4486839	4490264	And we will talk more about the contest when we come back, boys and girls.
4542074	4542914	Thanks for watching!
4609577	4610318	Thanks for watching!
4638526	4639507	Thanks for watching!
4707700	4708261	and many more.
4777634	4778536	Thank you for watching!
4846348	4855071	Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.
4860912	4867354	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and as you probably figured out, that was a break all about Akira Yamaoka music.
4867474	4870935	Yes, the contest does have something to do with Akira Yamaoka.
4871035	4872516	So, drumroll please.
4876065	4894198	We are going to be giving away, along with our buddies over at DDRspot.com, they are relaunching next month, and as part of their kickoff, that site and ourself, we are going to be giving away, between the two sites, four autographed Akira Yamaoka Silent Hill 4 mini-discs.
4894964	4895645	SILENT HILL 4
4915834	4916715	and DarkSakura.com.
4932894	4935976	We will ask one trivia question about Akira Yamaoka.
4936376	4939839	You have until Sunday Night Show to send us the answer.
4940459	4946323	And then we will pick a random entry live on Sunday Night Show and get ourselves a winner for the contest.
4946463	4948264	And special thanks to our buddy...
4948635	4958866	Floatwalk over at KDAA and DDRspot.com who has helped us get this and will be assisting in mailing out the prizes to our winners.
4959507	4960968	Unfortunately, there is a downside to this.
4961209	4969498	If you have visited Orange Lounge Radio live and in person three times or more, you are considered a frequent guest and therefore are eligible.
4970495	4972877	What if it was like less than three times this year?
4972897	4974458	What if I suck your balls?
4974478	4975559	That hooker being Jason.
4975579	4976980	But I know the founder of DDR Spot.
4977000	4977100	Yeah.
4996099	4998060	But I know the founder of DDR Spot.
4998180	4998560	I know.
4998620	5000381	Well, maybe you can put out or something.
5000421	5000741	I don't know.
5002621	5002962	Alright.
5006643	5011685	So... So there will be one question across three different shows.
5011725	5013926	So that means you're going to have to listen every night.
5014406	5014486	Or...
5015399	5023242	You can have friends listen and share the questions, but just remember, if you go sharing the questions with everybody, that's more people who are going to enter themselves in the contest.
5023262	5025543	So strategize however you want.
5025823	5034786	I'm actually expecting that only a few people are going to enter, but I want the diehard fans of the station to have first crack at it, and that's the best thing I can come up with.
5034806	5036167	This is like The Apprentice.
5036547	5040328	Only those that listen to all the shows are going to have a chance.
5040428	5041809	Otherwise, you're fired.
5042402	5046705	But I was such a diehard fan, I came and visited the show boarded three times.
5046725	5047246	That's alright.
5047486	5053210	You get to experience OLR live and in person, and we put out for you.
5053570	5053990	Fired!
5055371	5057713	But you don't autograph CDs for me.
5058954	5061756	I will take a poo and autograph it for you.
5062997	5063357	Sweet.
5063417	5064398	Is that going to be on air today?
5065319	5065519	Yes.
5066039	5066339	Alright.
5066439	5067980	Dude, they're putting everything else on DVD.
5068000	5069381	They may as well put us on there.
5069462	5069982	Complete...
5072148	5072388	On DVDs.
5072888	5076229	Complete rules to come later on our website.
5076269	5077810	However, just wanted to get that out there.
5078290	5079950	We also need a clever name for the contest.
5079970	5081491	We don't have a name for the contest yet.
5081551	5082511	Win prize.
5084612	5086252	Answer question, win prize.
5089573	5092694	It's the answer question, win prize segment.
5093515	5094195	But it's questions.
5094315	5095475	Question the answer you have.
5097176	5098256	Question the answer you give.
5100875	5103076	I like also the idea of win a piece of Akira.
5105656	5107177	No, that'd be Jamie's department.
5107557	5107917	All right.
5108657	5109057	We'll see.
5110517	5116599	All right, so... Hopefully... Jamie, you're having way too much fun in our chat room there.
5117039	5117959	It's not just me.
5118279	5121680	Over at www.orangeonstrator.com, clicking on chat.
5122120	5124261	So... You can see...
5125385	5133431	Me and Sigurd use Akira Yamaoka lyrics to describe the multiple ways that we will be enjoying his presence.
5135293	5140577	Sigurd is very upset because he's ineligible because he's been to the show like four times.
5141698	5143039	El Mullet cannot have poo.
5143259	5143679	Only me.
5146021	5146962	Oh, I like that idea.
5147022	5149504	The next best thing to sex with Akira contest.
5151425	5151906	I'll win that.
5153291	5155513	Next best thing to being a faghead, Akira comments.
5155533	5156674	I don't know, I'm just tired.
5156694	5159036	Was there a song unveiled that I completely forgot about?
5159056	5159096	Uh...
5179934	5183724	Oh yeah, and I promised everybody we'd play it as well, so we better do that.
5184025	5185609	We did have that one song that was unveiled.
5185669	5187835	I totally forgot about that because I played it Wednesday.
5189282	5189803	I remember.
5189863	5193886	We did have one new licensed song, or, well, technically it's not a license.
5194226	5197789	It's one of those, they haven't really said where they got the song yet.
5198169	5203913	But Day Behavior is the band, and the song is Superstar, and it's the Nevaraka mix.
5204254	5205394	It's a seven minute song.
5205414	5208337	I'm going to play you guys like a two, three minute clip so you can get a feel for it.
5208697	5210238	So I really like this song, by the way.
5210638	5213761	And you're going to be dancing to it this November when Ultramix 2 hits shelves.
5214081	5216563	Here it is, Day Behavior with Superstar.
5274612	5276174	I wanted to be someone I'm the
5415141	5417483	Alright, that's a little clip of that song for you there.
5417503	5420725	It's Day Behavior with Superstar, the Neveraka mix.
5421085	5425868	And you can actually download that song for free over on Amazon.com if you want to check out the whole thing.
5426208	5429210	Just remember the Day Behavior, the band, it's all one word.
5429390	5429710	Okay?
5430191	5430671	Day Behavior.
5431511	5432452	What did you guys think of that song?
5432892	5433433	That was pretty cool.
5433673	5433993	I like it.
5434508	5443556	I actually like the original a lot, too, and I was kind of... I actually have to express I'm a tiny bit disappointed the original wasn't the one that was used, because I actually like the original.
5443836	5445598	Let me play a little clip of the original.
5448821	5457208	Okay, because like... This is like old DDR stuff.
5457408	5457628	Right.
5457809	5461412	When I first heard that Day Behavior Superstar was going to be in DDR...
5462588	5481163	I actually got that one thinking that that was the mix but it's not, it's actually that remix but check out the original too if you have a chance I'm really liking this synth pop direction that Ultramix 2 is going in between this and Echo Image and everything so I don't know, what do you guys think?
5482224	5484266	Anybody else have a comment about Day Behavior, Superstar?
5486167	5490691	Don't shh me Alright
5494261	5497163	Okay, we'll be getting into Cage Match in a little bit.
5497263	5501165	I guess I'll open up the Skype line for a minute if anybody has a comment on that song.
5504847	5509349	In other DDR news, I may cut you off if we get a call, Loki, but I know you had some sim news you want to share.
5509669	5514092	I know something with Food Mix happened, like there was some kind of hidden song or something going on.
5514152	5515713	Was that last week?
5515753	5516473	I thought that was this week.
5517659	5518859	Did you bring that up last week?
5519119	5519639	Oh, my bad.
5519699	5520880	Oh, because it came up last Sunday.
5520920	5521140	Well, hell.
5521160	5523720	And if people read our website regularly, they would have also seen it.
5524040	5527801	I read it regularly, but I just forgot it was a week ago.
5528361	5528741	All right.
5528841	5530301	So, fine.
5530601	5532582	I wasn't really talking about you, Rob.
5535282	5535602	All right.
5536242	5540283	Well, Loki, while we're waiting to get a call on the skyline, what else is going on?
5540303	5542104	I know there's some stuff going on in the sim world this week.
5542564	5543344	Tell us one thing.
5543684	5544564	Something about Step Mania.
5545896	5547697	It's Alpha 23 time!
5548097	5548617	And guess what?
5548677	5549797	It's buggy as hell!
5550478	5551038	And guess what?
5551078	5551478	I don't care.
5552638	5553919	Yeah, I guess they did stuff.
5553939	5555499	They fixed stuff, added stuff.
5556800	5558901	No one really cares other than the fact that it's buggy.
5559481	5560201	That's what I read.
5560441	5560761	Buggy.
5561461	5566023	But, um, other than that, not much else going on as far as sim stuff goes.
5566063	5571605	I know there's that, um, OSC 3 or something like that that's going on right now.
5571785	5572345	OSC 2.
5572385	5572705	I think it's 3.
5573706	5574126	And, um...
5574907	5579829	That's in like round two or three right now of sets of stuff that they have.
5579849	5581710	You can check out Bomay's self on their front page.
5582590	5585991	And other than that, really not too much else going on.
5586011	5587712	There's a couple remix contests going on.
5587832	5591473	One in Bomani style and the other one on DDR Maniacs.
5591733	5593734	Both very similar in content.
5594934	5599016	Bomay's self, I know, some of the artists have been putting their tracks up for people to listen to.
5599096	5600937	But the judging and the actual...
5602357	5602577	All right.
5602597	5602898	Fair enough.
5625748	5626048	That's so girly.
5626068	5626168	God.
5652711	5654072	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5675320	5680524	Last week in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, Echo Image was entered.
5680704	5684346	And because you know they have that song Skulk that's going to be in DDR.
5684666	5687848	Well, if you pick up their CD, which by the way is an awesome, awesome CD.
5687889	5688769	I highly recommend it.
5689289	5690730	Compufonic, I believe is the name of the CD.
5690790	5692412	Check out echoimage.com for more info.
5693012	5695954	We played a track from that CD which won our Cage Match last week.
5695974	5696654	It was my pick.
5697015	5699036	And the song was Standing Alone.
5699336	5702078	So you get to hear a clip of it because it won last week's Cage Match.
5702498	5707762	So remember the way the cage match works, you hear a clip of last week's winner and then you hear two new songs in their entirety.
5708083	5713927	You pick your favorite and the best goes into rotation all week long here on Orange Lounge Radio.
5713947	5715008	So are you ready to kick it off?
5715789	5716189	Show off.
5716209	5717850	You have to be in our chat room to participate.
5718631	5725156	Here it goes, song number one, tonight's cage match is last week's winner, Standing Alone by Echo Image.
5725256	5726237	Here is a clip.
5773168	5790239	Black rain clouds sealing up the sun The shouting voices in your head Tell me nothing You scream but no one hear you calling You left with all your life My life
5844318	5846519	Alright, that was song number one in tonight's cage match.
5846719	5849140	Echo Image with Standing Alone.
5849760	5851101	Can't get enough of that CD this week.
5851221	5852981	I swear that group sounds like Depeche Mode.
5853021	5853882	They're just the bomb.
5853962	5855382	I love that CD.
5856223	5856543	Love it.
5857443	5861085	Track nine is my favorite, but it's not good for cage matches, so...
5861778	5864538	I'd like to mention now, we'll post this in the chat room in a little bit.
5864859	5874800	There's the website, actually the artist website, their label, A Different Drum, has a whole fucking gigantic page of synth pop.
5874940	5881041	Free downloads you can get, including Echo Image, some of their stuff, including the track you heard, Staying Alone.
5881181	5883762	So, huge fucking downloads.
5883782	5886302	Well, pretty much they're all linked to Amazon, but hey, it doesn't matter.
5887242	5888123	Synth pop owns.
5888183	5889983	Check out this site, adifferentdrum.com.
5890083	5890343	Awesome.
5890868	5893069	Post that link in our chatroom for our listeners, if you wouldn't mind.
5893609	5901150	Alright, let's get into song number two, which comes to us tonight, courtesy of the lovely DarkSakura, and I see it's a little bit of a different sound.
5901491	5905892	Yeah, I decided to go for something different, but actually it's more just because it's sort of been sitting on my head for a while.
5907332	5908992	I'll give a little bit of backstory to this.
5909713	5919675	You know, Dan's been really big with his main cabinet, the Multi-Arcade Machine Emulator, and he got another emulator called Daphne that plays the old Laserdisc games, like Dragon's Lair and Space Ace.
5920416	5921596	He got Cliffjumper to work.
5922077	5928279	Now if anyone remembers the game Cliffjumper, it was basically using scenes from Lupin the Third Castle Cagliostro.
5928939	5934521	So in honor of that, I decided to pick the Tokyo Ska Orchestra with the theme of Lupin the Third.
5935142	5935822	This should be great.
5935862	5940303	So DDR folks know this one, because, you know, Lupin the Third, obviously, and most... And anime.
5940544	5940904	Anime.
5940964	5945806	Most DDR and anime tend to have that hand-in-hand thing going on, so... So this is classic.
5946026	5946426	Alright.
5946726	5947106	Here we go.
5947166	5949507	Tokyo Paradise Ska Orchestra with...
5949929	5951050	Theme from Lupin the Third.
5951090	5951370	Enjoy.
5967918	5969020	Thank you for watching!
5991073	5991373	Let's go!
5991393	5991674	Let's go!
6088101	6088583	Thank you.
6112700	6114161	My name is Ant-Man.
6114261	6116142	I'm the grandson of Narada's title fan.
6116242	6118643	I'm the only one who has the power to rule the world.
6118664	6119204	This is my heart.
6134096	6136038	Alright, that was song number two in tonight's cage match.
6136078	6139560	The Tokyo Paradise Ska Orchestra with a theme from Lupin the Third.
6139961	6143323	Let's see what the general theme is in this room about that song.
6143383	6144044	DarkSakura.
6144164	6144524	Ten.
6145285	6145705	Ten.
6146025	6152210	Just because when I first downloaded that song like a long time ago, I downloaded a bunch of Lupin the Third mixes.
6152690	6154532	And that one I had on repeat for like ever.
6155152	6157734	Just because it was so energetic.
6159256	6159576	Alright.
6161337	6162338	Dark Child, what did you think?
6163847	6167189	I'd give it, I'd say maybe a 6.5.
6167269	6175193	Well, I listened to it, all I could think of was like late 70s, early 80s, people just cruising down a beach in some kind of movie.
6175693	6178754	Which I guess fits Lupin, but yeah, I'd give it about 6.5.
6178854	6180315	It just really isn't my style.
6180595	6180915	Alright.
6181556	6182836	I'm not a Ska fan, that's alright.
6182876	6183817	Alright, DDRcolic.
6184577	6186858	I'm not big on Ska either, but I liked it a lot.
6187659	6190400	I'd give it like a 9, because it was very fun.
6190780	6192101	Very well put together, I think.
6192654	6192754	Angel
6223109	6223810	It's just Lupin.
6224891	6228053	So I give this a 6.
6228153	6229715	Me personally, I actually liked it a lot.
6229755	6231316	It was kind of jazzy.
6231336	6232237	It made me want to get up and dance.
6232577	6239343	I wouldn't be surprised if something like that showed up in Ultramix with the randomness that game is getting in the different genres.
6239363	6240303	Yeah, it would be fun.
6240904	6241644	I give it like an 8.5.
6241724	6242485	A lot of fun.
6242845	6243426	Correction.
6243846	6244026	What?
6244066	6246168	Jason gives it a 6.5 and a hump of cinnamon roll.
6246829	6247289	All right.
6247890	6248270	Moving on.
6249029	6252330	Uh, let's go on to Loki's pick, and let's see what he's picked for us.
6252430	6254071	Ooh, I see it's a Ditter song.
6255151	6255531	A what?
6256772	6257992	DDR, Ditter, get it?
6259133	6261613	I'm sorry, I'm not hip to your crap.
6261754	6267435	Anyways, um, no, this is a song that, um, that DM Ashura did.
6267656	6271617	He was, he made two songs for, um, the Bomani Style Remix Contest.
6272128	6276471	One of them being a remix of Klung Klung and the other one being a remix of, you know, Max.
6277071	6278832	So, this one's kind of interesting.
6278952	6280774	It's like a rave version of Max.
6280954	6285677	But, like, you know... Not, like, you know, gay rave.
6285917	6291740	Like fucking... Like fucking hardcore rave shit.
6291821	6298145	Not this, like, crappy, like, you know, stupid, uh, you know, star mine crap.
6298205	6300026	This is, like, fucking hardcore shit.
6300066	6300406	None of this.
6301869	6302930	Anyway, just play the song.
6303150	6306412	This is Max Attack by DM Ashura.
6308934	6313257	Alright, I'm going to queue it up here and you guys can take a look at this and see if you want to vote for it.
6313597	6317199	It's a rave version of a popular DDR song.
6317259	6317960	Here it is.
6318500	6320762	It's DM Ashura with Max Attack.
6326185	6327226	Just kidding, just kidding.
6327266	6327826	I couldn't read it.
6327846	6328887	I need a hug.
6332247	6334753	DM Ashura with Max Attack
6369028	6369769	Thanks for watching!
6411994	6412801	Thanks for watching!
6455132	6456093	Thanks for watching!
6507427	6508528	Thanks for watching!
6536471	6537371	Thanks for watching!
6573806	6578429	All right, we are back, and let's see what everybody thought of Max Attack.
6579750	6580250	You know what?
6581731	6586874	I liked that last part that was different from everything else, but I don't like Max.
6589295	6591616	And I don't like, usually don't like the mixes of Max.
6593117	6596619	That one was okay, and it sort of reminded me of that scene from Blade.
6597240	6597340	But...
6602145	6602965	It's still maxed.
6604026	6604986	I mean, it wasn't bad.
6605086	6605647	It was not bad.
6605967	6608028	It's even, it's better than max 300.
6609028	6613210	Or max any of the other million versions of VR Max there are.
6613750	6620853	So, since I would normally give max a 4, I'm going to give that a 6.5.
6620993	6621994	Alright.
6622534	6623494	Just above average.
6624315	6625275	6.5 from Jamie.
6625715	6626236	Dark Childs.
6627936	6631458	Once again, Loki manages to pick the song that I tend to like
6632301	6633741	So I'm going to give it a 10.
6634402	6643484	While thinking of it and listening to it, I can totally picture my homeboy Enrique doing a light show with his orbiter as all my friends fizz out and get crazy.
6644224	6644484	So, 10.
6645945	6646965	Alright, DDRGolic.
6649346	6651926	I'm kind of with Jamie on the Max issue.
6652166	6655527	Max is kind of like a noise song for me.
6656328	6658088	It's not bad, but it's more noisy.
6658948	6661569	But I like the way they mixed this towards the end especially.
6663022	6665303	It had a lot of energy behind it.
6665543	6668023	It kind of made me tired just listening to it.
6668423	6671404	But I think I would give it like, let's say a 7.
6672084	6672865	It's not too bad.
6672985	6674505	It's pretty good.
6674605	6675765	I would listen to it.
6676065	6676445	I like it.
6676665	6677286	Alright, Angel.
6678846	6679846	Alright, I'm going to give it a 10.
6680126	6681407	And I'm going to tell you why I'm going to give it a 10.
6681547	6681867	Why is that?
6682187	6686948	Because I respect DM Ashura just as much as I respect our Loki over here.
6687248	6687568	Because...
6688140	6697646	I'll tell you what, I've heard a lot of remixes, and out of a lot of them, I mean, DM Ashura and Loki, they just, I don't know, they just have a talent.
6698066	6703189	They both have very extreme talent, and I, you know, I really respect that, so that's why I'm giving it a 10.
6704009	6704350	Loki!
6705690	6706951	His stuff just keeps getting better.
6707031	6710513	I mean, I honestly, I hated Max Resurrection when he first made it.
6710633	6712615	I thought it was like, eh, it was okay.
6713055	6716617	I mean, at least it's better than anything that, you know, what Bomani Ruler did.
6717096	6719298	Man, I totally forgot about the money roller.
6719318	6723082	But anyways, yeah, he just keeps getting better at his stuff.
6723402	6733171	I like how he's gone away from more of the MIDI stuff and kind of actually starting to use more of the tools at hand.
6733191	6736715	So yeah, I'd give it like a 10, because it's really good.
6736895	6740218	And I really wanted to play the Clone Clone one, but you know...
6740842	6741483	Go check it out there.
6770683	6771663	Did you enter that contest?
6772284	6772784	No, he did not.
6773344	6774984	Alright, screw it.
6775665	6777685	I thought that was an excellent remix.
6777785	6779806	It's very well done.
6780286	6782167	DM Ashura is very talented.
6782207	6787308	He's one of the best Bomani remixers out there today, and the remix was incredibly well done.
6787588	6788869	That being said, I give it a 4.
6789829	6791750	Because... What's wrong with that?
6792010	6795431	Because I am absolutely sick and fucking tired of Max.
6795631	6795811	I am...
6796963	6799326	I'm sorry, but that song did nothing for me.
6799386	6801108	I sat there going, God, this is good.
6801168	6801969	It's so well done.
6802029	6803771	I'm like, this should hella be in DDR.
6803791	6806114	But then I'm like, but I'm fucking sick of this song.
6806174	6808156	I'm so fucking sick of this song.
6808937	6809638	Sorry.
6810238	6811259	That's just how I feel.
6812641	6814303	So, there you have it.
6814965	6817526	But anyway, it doesn't matter what I think or what anybody here thinks.
6817586	6822487	It's really up to you guys out there in our chat room to place a vote for your favorite song.
6822527	6824307	And here are those three songs once again.
6824627	6827228	Song number one was Echo Image with Standing Alone.
6839250	6844411	Song number two tonight was Tokyo Paradise Ska Orchestra with a theme from Lubin the Third.
6856887	6859097	Alright, and song number three tonight, D.M.
6859158	6861127	Ashura with Max Attack.
6871366	6872127	Thanks for watching!
6898271	6903233	I mentioned earlier in my live journal that I was going to be finishing one of my songs.
6903834	6908496	Now, I have not finished the song yet, but I was going to let you guys know what I was planning to do.
6909096	6916099	Because one of the best remixes that I think I've done has been the Ecstasy 14 Hours mix.
6916459	6919621	But I was thinking to myself, what could make it better?
6920241	6921462	What could make it better?
6921922	6923403	Tell us, Loki.
6923743	6926304	It just so happens that in my family...
6926826	6929307	There is a certain person who has vocal talent.
6929507	6930708	Obviously, it's not me.
6931508	6931908	What?
6932328	6934949	It would be my sister, Gypsy Wolf, who was on the show last week.
6935309	6941532	She's going to be... As soon as I figure out what I'm going to do and write the lyrics, she's going to be laying down a vocal track for that song.
6942212	6942572	Sweet.
6942792	6945013	A completely original vocal track to go with it.
6945033	6946134	That's awesome.
6946874	6949635	So... Wow, I didn't know your sister could sing.
6949695	6950195	That's cool.
6950215	6951916	So that's my plan.
6952316	6956198	And then I'm going to also, you know, finish it off, make it the full length, and...
6957213	6957673	We'll do that.
6957973	6958894	So that should be awesome.
6961216	6961916	What kind of lyrics?
6962656	6962997	I don't know.
6963057	6964257	I haven't really thought about that yet.
6964718	6965398	That's the problem.
6965418	6966959	I've got to figure that out.
6967139	6970021	But I've still got... We've set the date to when we're going to record.
6970942	6973223	Not this coming up Wednesday, but a week from Wednesday.
6973783	6977586	So I have about 10 days or so to figure out something.
6977706	6977886	So...
6979695	6980535	I should have enough time.
6981396	6982876	Have you done voices before?
6983116	6983376	Voice?
6983476	6983796	Vocals?
6983876	6984597	No, I haven't.
6984757	6986557	It's just an experiment.
6986617	6987137	See if it'll work.
6987538	6993459	I think it should be fine because we have a pretty quiet apartment here.
6993499	6995080	It shouldn't be that much background stuff.
6995600	6999861	Really, the song has a very simple beat to it.
7001262	7002582	Just figure out something.
7002602	7004223	I just have to figure out cool lyrics for it.
7004283	7004803	That's about it.
7005403	7006163	That's cool.
7006484	7006824	Awesome.
7007144	7007604	Good for you.
7011401	7014383	Last call for cage match votes in our chat room, by the way.
7014423	7015984	Here's your last chance to submit a cage match vote.
7016084	7018805	Very, very close race right now between all three songs.
7018985	7019385	Very close.
7019405	7022367	While they're voting, we do have an opportunity to put in some plugs there.
7022747	7023107	Ah, yes.
7023268	7024208	Go and do some plugs.
7024748	7027850	Well, we have the one on Monday, right?
7029409	7046298	Absolutely, Monday nights is Diversion on Orange Lawns Radio, our Bomani remix show, and it runs between 7 o'clock and 9 o'clock, and of course you're going to hear stuff like Even Though I'm Sick of Max, I think that song definitely deserves to be in rotation on that show, Max Attack, along with some of the other recent remixes.
7046338	7051701	In fact, this week we're going to feature a lot of the newer recent remixes from that thread, so some of the good stuff.
7052101	7053302	So we'll add that in for you guys.
7053742	7055702	And that's going to be this Monday night and every Monday night.
7055943	7056683	The Monty Remixes.
7056743	7057603	It's an awesome show.
7057683	7061604	Seriously, if you like DDR, if you like 2DX, you're missing out if you're not listening to this show.
7061624	7063204	There's some good, good stuff on it.
7063724	7065725	I think it's the little gem of our station, honestly.
7068385	7069986	Tuesday is my baby.
7070386	7072586	My retarded, backwards, beaten baby.
7072626	7073746	Two-headed from Silent Hill 4.
7073786	7075827	My two-headed baby from Silent Hill 4.
7076687	7080428	It's Pump Up the Volume, named after a really awesome movie from the 80s.
7081158	7081719	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7105782	7107703	and basically I go on until about 10.30 or so.
7107743	7109323	This is Pacific time, by the way.
7110703	7111703	And sometimes I go later.
7112063	7115444	But I just play, you know, if you're in our chat room, I'll play whatever you request.
7115544	7117584	But lately I've been doing marathons of stuff.
7118065	7120665	This past week I did Strong Bad Sings.
7122125	7122906	Oh, God.
7123886	7126206	And I did something else.
7126606	7128247	I really don't remember what the hell it was.
7128827	7131987	Oh, yeah, I did a bunch of Richard Cheese Lounge Against the Machine.
7132888	7134628	Like you might have heard for our...
7135632	7135773	And, uh...
7148708	7163273	I'm probably going to be doing another comedy week soon, but I'm thinking that this Tuesday I'm going to probably play some Desiree, play some... Oh, we've got requests to play Strong Bad Things.
7163293	7166694	Well, maybe I'll sneak in a few of the tracks off of Strong Bad Things again.
7166934	7168155	But I think that I'm just going to go...
7168953	7170334	What the hell is up with Pump Up the Vicodin?
7193402	7193782	I like that.
7193842	7195003	I am not on Vicodin.
7196143	7202046	Wednesday night, brand new show, Outside the Box is actually going to be on break for the next two weeks because I'm gone.
7202186	7206148	So you're going to get some Vanilla Sky Retro for the next two weeks.
7206188	7209430	Vanilla Sky Retro, some of our old ass shit.
7209810	7210690	for the next couple weeks.
7211070	7211671	Old-ass shit.
7211911	7222974	And actually, we will do, we're going to do some old-ass shit next week, and then in a couple weeks, you'll hear the Outside the Box preview show, because a lot of you guys missed that, so we're going to replay that preview show, because we didn't announce it.
7223254	7225155	So, we'll give you guys a second chance to hear it.
7225795	7227735	So, at least you guys have something new to look forward to.
7227795	7231096	So, look forward to a Vanilla Sky Retro a bit, and Outside the Box.
7231196	7233537	And then when I get back, all new episodes!
7233877	7234337	Yay!
7234357	7235318	For months and months and months.
7236258	7236518	All right.
7238209	7241852	You certainly should do video game music trivia again, DarkSakura.
7242773	7243554	What did you just say?
7244235	7247458	You should do video game music trivia again, DarkSakura.
7258820	7269008	I'm going to be setting up an email just for Video Game Music Trivia for our various trivia things as well as our contest.
7269168	7269969	Maybe I should do that.
7270149	7270469	All right.
7272731	7273312	Let's see.
7273332	7275153	DarkTal, do you have something you want to say?
7275634	7277255	Yes, before the votes are tallied.
7277435	7277675	Yes.
7277975	7282039	Slash MSG space sky space vote three.
7282359	7282679	Enter.
7282899	7286042	Actually, the voting's closed because I'm just about to announce the winner.
7286943	7287703	Meet your Rob.
7288084	7288404	All right.
7289016	7290877	What do you guys think won tonight?
7291097	7292138	What do you guys think won tonight?
7292198	7292738	Holic.
7293159	7293499	Holic.
7294400	7295700	Loki says Echo Image won again.
7295720	7296301	What do you think, Jamie?
7296741	7297101	Holic.
7297241	7297602	Holic.
7297742	7298762	What do you think, Angel?
7300724	7301384	That's really hard.
7302765	7304026	Let me think about that for a second.
7304146	7306307	Okay, here it is, tonight's winner.
7306327	7309709	And I've got to say, tonight's winner actually kind of surprised me.
7309749	7313512	I wasn't expecting this one to win, but it won by one vote.
7313812	7314793	Oh, my God.
7314833	7316574	Yet again, won by one vote.
7318638	7322062	Tokyo Skull Orchestra with Lupin the Third.
7322222	7326726	I actually, I thought our chat room was going to go for the other stuff.
7326967	7327848	I was kind of surprised.
7328769	7334254	One vote over Echo Image and one vote, or I'm sorry, two votes over DM Assure.
7334274	7336617	It was a very, very close cage match tonight.
7336657	7337778	Wow, unbelievable.
7338991	7340672	I'm actually surprised, Jamie.
7340692	7349334	I mean, I don't want to dog your pick or anything, but usually the pattern of the chatroom is they go towards the techno stuff, and the Bomani remixes always win.
7349394	7352015	I think that is the first time a Bomani remix has not won.
7353155	7355716	But you can consider Lupin the Third a remix.
7355796	7356156	I don't know.
7356216	7358276	Well, yeah, it did have two.
7358536	7364018	Actually, it was in Beatmania 3, as well as being in DDR3.
7364662	7366384	and of course our chat rooms up in arms.
7366924	7368205	Hey, you voted.
7368265	7368826	That's right.
7368966	7369386	You guys voted.
7369426	7370007	Don't blame us.
7370127	7370747	You voted.
7370767	7371208	That's right.
7371568	7375131	You need to exercise your right to vote as you should this November as well.
7376192	7376533	Rob.
7376813	7377033	What?
7377233	7378074	You forgot one.
7378314	7378534	What?
7378634	7379615	What's after Wednesday?
7380316	7381877	Thursday, the Orange House Radio Rewind.
7382057	7382678	Thank you.
7382858	7384139	And it's a week behind, guys.
7384319	7384600	Sorry.
7384880	7386882	But next week you're actually going to hear...
7387648	7390250	The last week's show with Floatwalk, which was a really good show, though.
7390350	7390710	So listen.
7390730	7391190	Of course it was.
7391230	7392171	And then in two weeks you'll hear.
7392331	7398575	But that's actually a good thing that it's off by a week because it gives me a chance to put in next week's show after I'm gone.
7398595	7399716	Maybe we did it that way on purpose.
7400637	7400957	Uh-huh.
7402798	7403138	All right.
7406260	7406580	Wow.
7407101	7407921	I'm still surprised.
7407941	7410643	That's like the most surprising cage match win I think I've had.
7410783	7411624	Nothing but surprises here.
7412905	7413925	We have a request in the chat.
7413965	7416467	And that means you whores are getting Brittany next week from me.
7417876	7424381	I mean, um... Actually, I have a great... I think next week I'm going to go to my Sesame Street Sings album.
7425281	7425562	Yay!
7425662	7427343	That'd be cool.
7427583	7429544	Or what I'll do is I'll take a drum loop in the background.
7429584	7430305	It'll be a remix.
7431245	7431946	No, okay, Rob.
7431986	7435008	We need, like, some Bert songs being all evil.
7437129	7437529	All right.
7438890	7439190	Amazing.
7439270	7440131	Is that site still up?
7440211	7441572	BertisEvil.com?
7441632	7441832	Yes.
7441912	7442633	Oh, no.
7442713	7444294	I know there's BertisEvil sites.
7444334	7445975	Skype line's open if you guys have any comments.
7447225	7451429	I want to hear that clip of the Sesame Street characters all high again.
7451709	7452650	Yes!
7452730	7454291	Okay, Fortune Cookie next week.
7455592	7455952	Yay!
7455972	7458314	Does anybody have that Donald Duck having sex one?
7458334	7459515	I used to have that.
7459555	7463499	The Donald Duck getting a blowjob one.
7464019	7465801	I actually may still have that somewhere.
7466942	7470705	We should do a whole show next week of all Fortune Cookies.
7471225	7472046	That would be cool.
7472066	7472506	We should.
7475958	7479680	I'm always scared of what happens when I leave for a week, but we'll see.
7479740	7482521	Anyway, Skype line's ringing, and hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
7483782	7484202	Okay.
7486263	7486663	First up.
7487424	7487684	Yes.
7488084	7488464	Who's this?
7489265	7489785	It's Misty.
7489945	7490926	Hi, Misty, how are you?
7491066	7492487	Hi, Misty.
7492687	7496089	We like Misty because she helps archive cam pics for us.
7496789	7497650	How you doing?
7498810	7501051	Well, as you can tell, I finally got my mic.
7501292	7502732	Hey, good times.
7502872	7503713	What's on your mind, Misty?
7505029	7507591	Well, CageMash, I say we got screwed over.
7509833	7510633	Don't blame us.
7510694	7511214	Don't hate.
7511534	7514016	Do you want to tell what you voted for, Misty?
7516658	7518019	If Secret wants to, he can.
7518720	7520421	Oh, well, that gives it away right there.
7520762	7523003	Yeah, Misty voted for Echo Image, obviously.
7523504	7526866	I know it's a tough blow to all the Echo Image fans, but you know what?
7527187	7530209	I promise I will bring Echo Image back to the table in a later week.
7531090	7531570	Sounds good.
7531790	7532531	Alright, but I guess
7532984	7535865	We'll let Jamie have her moment with her little ska thing.
7536166	7537326	My little ska thing.
7537346	7538387	You said you liked it.
7539167	7540187	I have to give her a hard time.
7540207	7541108	I have to give her a hard time, totally.
7541128	7542549	That's a good ska song.
7542709	7543749	Anything else on your mind, Misty?
7545610	7550692	I just wanted to say happy birthday to Loki again, even though I said it to him in the live journal.
7551853	7553534	Personal happy birthdays are always good.
7554094	7554594	Thank you.
7555695	7558636	Wasn't that a great present that DD Alcoholic got him?
7562085	7564287	Yeah, giggling is about all I can say about it, too.
7564527	7566168	I forgot to mention.
7566569	7569031	Now, if I could show up for my birthday, would I get Jack?
7570112	7570352	Huh?
7570692	7571213	We'll see.
7572013	7574755	Would she get Jack Daniels if she could make it out here?
7574836	7575476	Sure, why not?
7578499	7580861	All right, we're going to let you go, Misty, so we can take another call.
7581701	7581961	All right.
7581981	7582542	Have a good one.
7582842	7583443	Thanks for calling.
7583463	7584023	Bye-bye.
7584383	7585264	It's good to hear from new people.
7585284	7586245	Let's hear from another new person.
7586525	7587546	Hello, you are on.
7587786	7588867	Oh, did I miss it?
7590108	7591009	Oh, the guy hung up.
7591795	7593876	I tried to pick up the phone from somebody new and they hung up.
7595036	7595376	Girl.
7595396	7596016	Call, call back.
7596076	7596797	Oh, they're calling back.
7596817	7597437	Let's try this again.
7598017	7599177	Howdy, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
7599977	7600818	Sorry about that, Sky.
7601238	7602498	Yeah, yeah, I know.
7602578	7602978	Who is this?
7604119	7605339	Uh, uh, S-Ghost.
7605539	7606920	Hi, S-Ghost, how are you?
7607760	7608660	I am doing very good.
7608700	7609720	How are you doing, Sky?
7609820	7610941	Good, I'm, I'm okay.
7611001	7611641	Life doesn't suck.
7612861	7617423	Alright, about the song, you know, yeah.
7617723	7618463	About the cage match?
7619383	7624805	Yeah, about the cage match, um, I just got back when I heard you announcing all three songs there.
7625005	7625285	Uh-huh.
7625925	7628566	Um, I think I'm personally responsible for Lupin winning.
7629927	7630447	Thank you.
7630567	7632347	Because you voted off that little clip there?
7632567	7635849	You'll get hugged, you'll get, like, like, eternal gratitude.
7635949	7643191	I was watching various, um, I feel sorry about talking about it, but I watched the new Kids on the Block, Bands Reunited.
7645512	7646632	Awesome, awesome.
7647653	7648693	But yeah, um...
7650035	7650755	Yeah.
7650995	7652276	Well, you know what?
7652316	7653896	It's all your fault, but that's alright.
7654256	7655297	We'll forgive you somehow.
7655857	7656337	I'll rule.
7656917	7663119	My girlfriend is either ignorant or, you know, maybe they were just taking some weird drugs that morning.
7663479	7665920	Sigurd is yelling at you in our chatroom right now as well.
7665980	7667400	He's a little angry at you.
7668320	7671541	Sigurd made my girlfriend hit me in the balls before the show.
7671741	7672602	How did that happen?
7672622	7673302	Wait.
7675482	7676323	Oh, you're cutting out, bud.
7676663	7677263	How did that happen?
7678422	7697552	Okay, basically, I have no idea where this came from, but we got discussing, and he started talking about, like, woman's place is in the kitchen, and then my girlfriend saw that, and she's like, defend me, and I'm like, okay, don't hurt me.
7697692	7701173	It's okay, because he's a big gay, so it doesn't matter.
7702734	7703114	All right.
7703515	7703935	All right.
7704235	7705175	Have a good one, Eskos.
7705756	7706556	Anything else you want to share?
7706576	7706656	Okay.
7708826	7709306	I don't know.
7710567	7716569	I just wanted to say that, yeah, I'm happy looping one.
7716989	7717389	All right.
7717709	7718049	All right.
7718089	7719470	Well, I'm glad you're happy.
7719490	7719710	Thank you.
7719730	7720350	Have a good one.
7721090	7721610	You too.
7721690	7722090	Bye.
7722651	7724291	At least this program can make somebody happy.
7724771	7728673	You know, for the longest time, I thought his name was S. Goat, not S. Ghost.
7728713	7729613	No, it's S. Ghost.
7729653	7730393	There's an S in there.
7730413	7730933	Can't you see it?
7730953	7731714	Like Space Ghost.
7731954	7732354	Yeah.
7732394	7732554	Right?
7733952	7738698	I figured it out now, but before I saw S-Goat, and I'm like, what the hell is S-Goat about?
7740040	7741061	The space ghost.
7741141	7741842	You idiot!
7744165	7744465	Alright.
7746608	7746968	Excuse me.
7747389	7749371	That's what you get for watching too much porn.
7749731	7751614	I think that when we come back...
7753905	7755346	and Fireball, because everybody likes that song.
7784136	7790378	Alright, so we will be back, and then we're going to do a Bomani match game, and I'm going to find us some contestants, because I want to get some people who haven't played before.
7790938	7794560	So we're going to get some Bomani match game when we come back.
7823042	7824122	Thank you for watching!
7860242	7861383	Thank you for watching!
7977345	7978327	It's great, man.
7979268	7979689	It's great.
8010426	8036300	I'm getting out of this town Got to pack my bags and bring my wagon around Move it out to the mountain, the sky, and the trees Move it out when nobody wants to feed anyone And nobody's backing me I wanna be with the creatures of great master Paradise rapture
8068672	8069353	Hi, Dead Air.
8069513	8071216	I forgot to queue up a promo.
8071336	8071737	My bad.
8072658	8074420	Listen to Orange Lounge Radio.
8074661	8077845	You're a big, stinky, poopy head and smells like Shermie's litter box.
8078246	8080209	Alright, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
8081238	8083778	and we're going to do a Bomani match game.
8084179	8086499	I decided tonight I would just handpick the contestants.
8086579	8090500	I just basically picked people that said, I want to play in our chat room and I set it up.
8090580	8092540	I picked people that we don't hear from a whole lot.
8092920	8101581	So we're actually going to call our first contestant because our first contestant is coming in over Skype tonight and actually, oh God, I hope I have the match game music.
8103742	8104922	Oh no!
8106102	8106922	I'm going to be sad.
8106942	8107442	You do have it.
8107823	8110503	I don't have the... I saw it on your list.
8110808	8113209	It used to be on my desktop, but I don't think I... Because I brought it.
8113229	8114209	I left it on your desktop.
8114570	8114850	Did you?
8114870	8115290	I bought it.
8116870	8118631	Yeah, but... Didn't we have to download it last time?
8118651	8118831	Yeah.
8119511	8124093	Yeah, I had to play it over and over and over again, but not this time.
8126174	8128295	Alright, well, maybe we need a new song.
8128475	8130276	I don't have the Price is Right theme.
8130296	8131876	I couldn't use that a long-ass time ago.
8132176	8133137	I don't have it anymore.
8135535	8141519	We haven't done the FUs, we could do that while you look for the... No, I don't want to get this over with, because I have my contestants ready.
8141599	8146062	So we'll just find a new theme song for Ask Orange Launch.
8146142	8147463	Oh, Loki's looking it up.
8147663	8151145	In the meantime, let's... Loki's taking mercy on us.
8151505	8153967	Let's give our first contestant a little phone call here.
8154767	8156188	He's supposed to be there, he better answer.
8158730	8161532	Let's click the buttons and get that to call.
8164457	8165078	One ring-a-dingy?
8166538	8167839	Two ring-a-dingys?
8169420	8169820	Hello?
8170820	8171141	Yo.
8171441	8173202	Hey, how you doing, Dork?
8174222	8174602	What's up?
8174902	8178904	Hey, I'm getting a little bit of feedback there, so turn down your Winamp a little bit.
8179965	8180485	Uh, whoops.
8180785	8181246	That's alright.
8181626	8182786	Is it good now?
8183026	8183767	Yes, it's very good.
8183787	8184467	You're nice and clear.
8184507	8184927	We like that.
8184967	8185548	Very clear.
8185668	8186208	Alright, good.
8186268	8190010	Dork is contestant number one tonight, and Dork will be playing against, in our chatroom...
8190737	8193840	Kyle Snyder will be the other contestant tonight.
8194681	8199926	All right, so Kyle versus Dork in tonight's Bimani match game.
8200486	8201187	I'm so excited.
8201227	8202468	You know how this works, right, Dork?
8204058	8204998	Uh, explain anything.
8205038	8207540	Alright, well that's what I always do, is I explain it anyway.
8207801	8212624	We're gonna give you a sentence, and you will be responsible for filling in the blank in that sentence.
8212904	8219570	But what you're trying to do is you're trying to match our famous celebrities here in studio, who will also be writing something down.
8219610	8220470	You're trying to match them.
8220530	8222092	So let's introduce tonight's celebrities.
8222752	8227736	Celebrity number one is, um, a very famous lady.
8227756	8229878	You'll recognize her from such films as...
8234420	8235420	DarkSakura, I don't know.
8235740	8238001	DarkSakura is celebrity number one tonight.
8238421	8244463	No, I starred in the Watch Me Shove My Foot So Far Up Your Ass You Taste Toenails.
8244663	8244983	All right.
8245383	8249024	Contestant number two tonight, you know him from a variety of gay porno.
8249124	8250144	It is Dark Child.
8251024	8253285	I started that movie, too, but I enjoyed it.
8253485	8253825	All right.
8254932	8261235	Contestant number three tonight is actually going to be the token black chick in the next Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen movie.
8261635	8263516	She's going to be their cousin from Africa.
8264076	8264717	Oh, my God.
8265297	8266358	DDRgaholic.
8266878	8268018	Hello, everyone.
8268038	8270860	I just had to work in a Mary-Kate-Ashley thing in there somehow.
8271600	8271880	All right.
8271980	8272320	Oh, my God.
8272701	8273081	All right.
8273241	8277503	And our third contestant will also be seen in the movie.
8277563	8279584	She will be playing Dr. Evil, however.
8279904	8280665	DDRangel.
8281145	8283086	I did not release the insane monkey.
8284965	8285866	Hi, Angel.
8285906	8286446	Hi, Dork.
8286927	8293592	Also cameoing in the next Mary Kay and Ashley film as the evil monkey is celebrity number five, Loki.
8294653	8295053	Hello.
8295073	8298216	I'm sorry, man.
8298496	8301678	Also playing tonight, the biggest celebrity of them all, me.
8302459	8304741	The biggest ego of them all.
8304961	8307643	I just have to say something to Dork because I like his screen name.
8307703	8307903	Yes.
8308143	8311686	I was in a band called Dork, and they have a webpage called Dork.com.
8313601	8315882	All right, do we have a TV theme?
8316702	8317482	We've got plenty.
8317642	8318942	Originalities suck.
8319383	8322763	Okay, we're going to get some kick-ass music here for the TV theme.
8323444	8324304	All right, let's see here.
8325024	8330045	How about we start off with... This is just... Yeah, we'll just play this.
8334606	8338047	Welcome to... The Money Match Game!
8338067	8338507	All right.
8339968	8340268	Here we go.
8343069	8343890	What the hell is this?
8346031	8346331	Alright.
8347052	8348233	Okay, here we go.
8348273	8351835	We need, um, uh... Question number one.
8352255	8352616	Shut up.
8352696	8353396	Question number one.
8353436	8353776	Here it is.
8355237	8356738	There's only three questions tonight.
8356778	8357779	It's a short game tonight.
8357839	8358440	We're waiting.
8358560	8358820	Alright.
8359220	8365624	For his birthday, Loki decided he would actually go out and play some DDR.
8366445	8372129	And as a special present to Loki, the arcade management let him do whatever he wanted to the machine.
8372955	8374516	So Loki decided to blank.
8377859	8378199	Oh, me?
8379360	8379740	Not yet.
8379880	8380501	Not yet, Dork.
8380541	8381001	Think about it.
8381081	8383523	Our celebrities are thinking about an answer right now.
8391089	8391409	Alright.
8393030	8393871	Still thinking here.
8393931	8396093	We're getting some answers from our celebrities here.
8396113	8396193	Okay.
8402438	8402938	One more time.
8403018	8405860	Loki decided he would actually go out and play some DDR for his birthday.
8406180	8411603	And as a special present to Loki, the arcade management let him do whatever he wanted to the machine.
8411963	8413403	So Loki decided to blank.
8424929	8426910	Yeah, I know it's the buying a car theme.
8427639	8427899	Thank you.
8427939	8428360	Thank you.
8428380	8428680	Thank you.
8450701	8451162	Here we go.
8451443	8452764	Let's see what we've got.
8453105	8457291	For his birthday, Loki decided he would actually go out and play some DDR.
8457632	8461998	And as a special present to Loki, the arcade management let him do whatever he wanted to the machine.
8462379	8464502	So Loki decided to... what, dork?
8465632	8470834	Well, first I thought about like he might Matrix Walk the damn machine.
8471194	8472734	That's an absurd answer.
8473294	8479476	I'm reading the chatroom and Zaku said Bukkake the machine.
8481177	8485218	But I would say my answer is to hump the coin slot.
8485458	8487218	Hump the coin slot.
8487278	8487939	Amazing.
8487979	8489219	Let's see what Kyle thought.
8489579	8492240	Kyle said Loki decided to...
8492930	8495873	Strip Dance on the Machine was Kyle's answer.
8496513	8497214	Pretty kinky.
8497674	8499536	Let's see if there's any match with our celebrities.
8499556	8502358	We're looking for Hump the Coin Slot and Strip Dance.
8502578	8503199	One of those answers.
8503539	8504400	Jamie, what did you get?
8504960	8510305	Mine was take an axe after it like they did in Office Space in honor of the Dead Step Mania.
8511566	8514308	Ah, take it out and kick the shit out of it like they did in Office Space.
8514448	8515509	Good answer, but not a match.
8516270	8516750	Dark Child.
8517631	8518472	My answer was
8519144	8526049	Toss the salad and stink finger the Olsen twins while videotaping from multiple angles to make his first feature-length hardcore porn.
8533354	8538177	That's almost a match with the strip dance one, but I can't give it to you.
8538277	8538657	Sorry.
8539618	8540899	DDArcoholic, what do you think?
8541940	8543180	I said hump the machine.
8543961	8545542	I think that's a match with the coin slot.
8546022	8546843	Good job.
8546903	8548244	Dork has one point.
8548939	8550719	Woohoo!
8553140	8554880	Alright, Angel, what did you say?
8554980	8559601	Loki decided to... Pretend he's making love to one of the twins and hump their coin return.
8561322	8562142	I guess that's it.
8562182	8563622	That's another match for Dork.
8564142	8565222	Hump the coin return.
8565282	8565682	Alright.
8566943	8567783	Loki, what did you get?
8567843	8572664	Loki decided to... The most obvious outside of the box answer.
8572944	8574024	Take it home!
8574644	8576045	Take the machine home.
8577005	8578165	Where it will be safe.
8578943	8579584	Wow.
8579744	8581286	Oh, that's such a G-rated answer.
8581446	8581766	All right.
8582807	8590836	My answer was Loki decided to, he got to do anything he wants, so Loki decided to bend over and shove birthday candles in his ass and shoot them at Golf Land Moms.
8593619	8594119	You're sick.
8594279	8594940	Awesome.
8596261	8598424	What kind of propellant is he using to shoot the candles?
8599585	8600126	Taco Bell.
8600166	8600826	Taco Bell?
8602942	8603382	All right.
8603522	8604503	Liquid or gas.
8604783	8605143	All right.
8605203	8606144	Anyway, let's move on.
8606164	8606564	No worse.
8606624	8607284	Del Taco.
8607745	8608005	All right.
8608025	8608405	Here we go.
8608445	8609285	Question number two.
8610906	8613127	Dork is up by two points, but that's all right, Kyle.
8613788	8614948	Here's your chance to catch up.
8615468	8615648	All right.
8615668	8616029	Here it is.
8616149	8617349	Question number two.
8618150	8618770	I want music.
8620971	8621471	I want music.
8621531	8622672	I got rhythm.
8623052	8623833	I got rhythm.
8625171	8630554	DarkSakura was so excited that Rob was going to be leaving for a whole two weeks.
8632015	8640219	When she got to take over his computer to run the show, she was extra sure to fill up Rob's hard drive with lots of blank.
8652586	8652906	Again,
8653649	8658233	DarkSakura was so excited that Rob was going to be leaving for a whole two weeks.
8658874	8667242	When she got to take over his computer to run the show, she was extra sure to fill up Rob's hard drive with lots of black.
8670385	8673008	Looking around to see what our celebrities are doing, they're writing furiously.
8673028	8674009	I had my answer already.
8677612	8678253	Loki's thinking.
8679717	8681038	Angel looks like she's still working.
8681078	8682758	She's poking holes in the couch or something.
8682778	8683579	What are you doing over there?
8684579	8685439	Oh, she's waiting for the pen.
8685499	8686480	Do you have an answer already?
8686860	8687100	Okay.
8687720	8688020	You're right.
8688600	8691021	Alright, everybody looks like they've just about dinged in.
8692842	8695923	So, I'm making sure Kyle... Okay, here we go.
8695983	8696303	Alright, good.
8696323	8697244	We got an answer from Kyle.
8697904	8698424	Stop the music.
8699124	8699685	Stop the music.
8701505	8701845	Stop it.
8702225	8702506	Alright.
8703186	8703526	Dork.
8703546	8703626	Dork.
8705029	8705669	What do you say?
8706529	8710110	DarkSakura was so excited that Rob was going to be leaving for a whole two weeks.
8710370	8717872	When she got to take over his computer to run the show, she was extra sure to fill up Rob's hard drive with lots of... J-Rock.
8718272	8719213	J-Rock.
8719613	8720233	Good answer.
8720293	8721453	Let's see if it's a match.
8721893	8727755	Kyle said, fill up Rob's hard drive with Mary-Kate and Ashley Garbage.
8729244	8730365	Running Joke tonight.
8730685	8731266	Let's see.
8732066	8736190	Let's see if Kyle gets a point off the Running Joke.
8736530	8736990	Let's see.
8737370	8743715	DarkSakura, you filled up my hard drive with lots of... I would treat your computer as well as I do my own.
8743996	8748279	Therefore, it would be filled with Ragnarok Online, Wonder Woman episodes, Stargate episodes, G.I.
8748299	8750641	Joe fanfiction, and J-Rock, just like my PC.
8751942	8752462	So, I don't know.
8752482	8753683	Does J-Rock count as a match?
8754584	8756485	It's one of the many... I'll give it half a point.
8756505	8756746	Half a point.
8756766	8757226	Half a point.
8758632	8759793	Half a point, you match for dork.
8759913	8760313	Good job.
8760593	8761174	Alright, let's see.
8762175	8763996	Just to clarify, but no Mary-Kate and Ashley.
8764636	8765417	Oh, hell no!
8765737	8766678	Oh, that's unfortunate.
8766758	8768659	Alright, Dark Child, what'd you put?
8768719	8772802	You know, I kind of went the same way as Jamie, except I figured she'd put stuff that's like on my computer.
8773322	8779787	So I said, Chupacabra butt-humping porn, hand-selected by me from my personal super-nasty collection.
8781428	8783129	What kind of porn was that again?
8783530	8784670	Chupacabra butt-humping.
8786572	8788293	Explain that to me when I'm a little bit older.
8789736	8790156	I don't get it.
8790196	8795540	They don't have any actual footage of it, but they have porno of it.
8796761	8800984	Well, yeah, you can't get a picture of all of Chupacabra, but they managed to get his ass in the film.
8802786	8803566	Poor Kyle.
8803886	8804387	Poor Kyle.
8804407	8805468	Let's see if we can get Kyle a match.
8805488	8807289	Let's see if we can get Kyle a match from DDR Golic.
8808230	8809010	Oh, I don't know.
8809491	8809851	Let's see.
8810589	8814471	I said the entire collection of Vivid Videos straight porn.
8815652	8816692	Oh, Vivid Videos, yes.
8816772	8823656	And I like some, like, sex-deprived... Virginia, it's Vivid, it's okay.
8823676	8826637	You know, it's just that Rob's sex-deprived.
8826717	8828298	We were thinking that you might want to help him out.
8828598	8830659	Okay, well, that makes sense.
8830719	8833861	Or just, you know, like, ruin his day with something.
8834381	8836302	Ew, our chat room's nasty.
8836322	8839944	They're saying nasty things about Akira Yamaoka and ferrets being put on the computer.
8839964	8840244	Uh-oh.
8841065	8842105	DDR Angel, what'd you say?
8842946	8843807	Gay Ditter Porn.
8844327	8845608	Gay Ditter Porn?
8845628	8848330	Okay, Ditter sounds like diddling.
8849051	8850352	Fine, DDR.
8850692	8852274	Gay DDR Porn, grand.
8852654	8855296	It sounds like a kinky sex act, too.
8855496	8857198	Yeah, it sounds like diddling.
8857418	8861061	She filled up my hard drive with lots of... Tack.
8862082	8862722	Tacku.
8863403	8865725	Excellent, excellent, but not a match.
8865745	8866605	I would do that.
8866725	8867166	I said...
8867808	8873249	She was extra sure to fill up Rob's hard drive with lots of her bank account information.
8874369	8875730	Not a match, unfortunately.
8876090	8877830	I have to answer something in the chat room.
8877870	8880311	Dark Knight is asking, why does that name sound familiar?
8880791	8882631	The Chupacabra is the goat eater.
8882891	8885692	You know, people in Mexico believe in him and people in Puerto Rico.
8885712	8887232	Can we please change the subject?
8887332	8887872	Oh, and Florida.
8887972	8888252	Alright.
8889012	8889692	Last question.
8890012	8892073	Kyle, here's your chance to catch it all up.
8892673	8895994	I'm casting a hex on Dork so that he will not match you on this one.
8896014	8896334	Let's see.
8896354	8896394	Um...
8899073	8900854	Rob was... Oh, I'm sorry, I need music.
8902515	8903476	Give me my music!
8903976	8904416	Give it to me!
8904737	8905017	Thank you.
8906558	8911741	Rob was excited to finally get to meet some new DDR players on the East Coast.
8912561	8921587	He walked into an arcade in New Jersey and proudly announced to the large DDR crowd gathered that my name is Sky and I like to blank.
8927110	8928011	Rob was excited...
8928604	8932026	to finally get to meet some new DDR players on the East Coast.
8932407	8940392	He walked into an arcade in New Jersey and proudly announced to the large DDR crowd gathered that my name is Sky and I like to blank.
8948037	8953441	Alright, let's, uh... DarkSakura's having a hard time coming up with an answer.
8953461	8954482	We'll have to give her an extra minute.
8956371	8959434	My name is Sky, and I like to blank.
8963417	8963817	Alright.
8968141	8968941	Waiting on some answers.
8970142	8971904	Waiting on Kyle, waiting on DarkSakura.
8972024	8973545	Oh, looks like Kyle just lit up there.
8973565	8974606	Let's see if he got an answer.
8976988	8978069	Excellent answer from Kyle.
8978109	8978509	Let's see.
8982633	8983774	Some very perverse answers.
8984094	8985395	Zaku, you're a pervert!
8986434	8986914	God!
8986934	8990256	Total perv!
8990276	8991317	Disgusting!
8992737	8994198	Idiot laid, or something.
8996179	9000181	Kyle's sad because he says, if I don't score any points, it's going to be really humiliating.
9000241	9005464	Look, Kyle, the way it usually works, usually it always ends in a tie game of 0-0.
9006184	9008185	Dork is exceptionally good at this game.
9008585	9011547	This is like playing Ken Jennings at Jeopardy, okay?
9011587	9013628	That guy who's won like 45 times in a row.
9013888	9015089	That's Dork, okay? 75.
9016280	9018182	Sorry, whatever, 75, however many times you want.
9019804	9021526	Alright, DarkSakura, did you get an answer?
9023248	9024450	I hope so, because the music's up.
9024930	9025231	Alright.
9025771	9027233	Never mind, I was going to say it in a second.
9027674	9028214	What, I'm sorry?
9028434	9029576	I was going to say something, but it's okay.
9029756	9030016	Alright.
9030317	9031959	My name is Skye, and I like to blank.
9031999	9034482	Let's see, first off, Dork.
9035423	9036384	Let me read it one more time.
9037316	9041198	Rob was excited to finally get to meet some new DDR players on the East Coast.
9041579	9057568	He walked into an arcade in New Jersey and proudly announced to the large DDR crowd gathered that my name is Sky and I like to... Get drunk while running up the walls claiming that he's in the Matrix and advertising Orange Lounge.
9058691	9069560	Run Up The Wall, Drunk, claiming that he's in the Matrix, referencing our last drunk show when that actually happened.
9070320	9071261	Let's see what Kyle said.
9071301	9075024	Kyle said, my name is Sky and I like to make fun of celebrities.
9075484	9076044	Which is true.
9076204	9077345	I do like to make fun of celebrities.
9077385	9079727	So let's see if anybody got a match on that.
9079807	9082729	Let's go around to Jamie.
9083050	9084791	Jamie, my name is Sky and I like to...
9085618	9086639	I couldn't think of anything.
9086699	9088060	I just said Whore Out Orange Lounge.
9088080	9090042	Whore Out Orange Lounge.
9090502	9091563	That's a very good answer.
9091643	9093445	Unfortunately, not a match.
9094966	9096567	Dark Child, dare I ask.
9096727	9100090	My name is Sky and I like to... Can I give my answer last?
9101571	9101811	No.
9102312	9102492	Okay.
9102552	9105474	I'm going to try to do it in one breath.
9105795	9106095	All right.
9106764	9117187	Eat chocolate salad sauce fresh from the arse of young 15-year-old dinner players made only from the milk of a virgin dairy cow and the chocolate from organically fed vegetarian pieces of trim and toned meat puppets.
9121029	9121869	Whatever!
9123409	9124650	Oh my god.
9124670	9125790	Very descriptive.
9128091	9132812	And now we, you know what, this is what happens when you leave Jason at home by himself all day.
9132832	9132892	Yes.
9133093	9134133	Remember.
9134173	9134513	Remember.
9135003	9137065	I go to a chiropractor three times a week.
9137246	9138727	What else am I going to fill my time with?
9139669	9140049	Porn.
9140129	9142852	Bukkake.
9144754	9146496	Both of those were acceptable answers.
9146517	9148699	My name is Sky and I like to... Play doubles!
9153820	9154740	Play doubles!
9154800	9159202	Oh, such a cute answer, but not a match.
9159242	9160183	I couldn't think of anything.
9160203	9161383	That's all right.
9161403	9162584	For the record, I hate doubles.
9162984	9166865	No, I do like to play doubles, but I only like to do my white boy freestyle to it.
9167546	9167846	All right.
9168726	9173408	Angel, my name is Sky, and I like to... Hold on.
9174329	9177470	Get down and freestyle to Sexy Planet Complete with your bitches.
9179391	9180752	Get down and freestyle to what?
9181033	9181813	Sexy Planet.
9181853	9182654	Sexy Planet.
9183094	9187898	Oh, the freestyle I wanted to do at the Scandia Tournament, but got denied.
9188319	9188599	All right.
9189119	9190000	Whatever you called them.
9190400	9193903	Loki, my name is Sky, and I like to... Yeah, what Jason said.
9197266	9199828	So you wrote down the exact same thing that Jason said.
9200268	9202610	No, I wrote down, yeah, what Jason said.
9209284	9215249	and lastly, my answer, my name is Sky and I like to play DDR.
9216510	9217570	Sorry.
9218691	9220693	Hello, perverts.
9222294	9225556	Alright, final tally in second place tonight.
9226717	9227758	Oh yes, we need tally music.
9227858	9228739	I demand tally music.
9230589	9236192	Eat, Chocolate, Salad, Sauce, Bestro.R That's right.
9236692	9242134	In second place tonight is Kyle with a zero point score.
9242214	9246836	But because we felt bad for him, we gave him one tenth of a point.
9247296	9249958	So one tenth of a point for Kyle.
9250578	9251398	Yay!
9251478	9252239	Thank you for playing.
9252679	9255160	As our runner up, you win nothing!
9256200	9257621	Absolutely nothing!
9257961	9258581	No, no, no.
9258621	9259742	We have to give him something.
9260861	9261082	Air.
9262548	9262909	Alright.
9262950	9263893	We'll send you some air.
9267599	9272183	and in first place tonight, the one, the only, Dork!
9272663	9273284	Yay!
9273384	9274865	With two and a half points.
9274885	9276746	I think that Dork's our highest score.
9276847	9280449	And as your prize, you get nothing!
9281710	9283312	Absolutely nothing!
9283612	9284132	You lose.
9284152	9284813	Do not pass go.
9284833	9287515	Do not collect $200 and go directly to jail.
9287695	9288576	Good day, sir.
9288916	9290437	You get bragging rights, my friend.
9290477	9291198	Good day, sir.
9291498	9292439	Turn off the damn music.
9292879	9293139	All right.
9293860	9294260	But not...
9294844	9296365	He's actually, I think he's our high score.
9296805	9299025	I think once we had three points.
9299325	9300086	That was Puppy.
9300326	9301646	Puppy, I think, got a three points.
9301706	9302406	I was close.
9302907	9303887	Yeah, you got close once too.
9303907	9308868	I was close because, you know what, I feel bad for Kyle, but it's not as bad as eating Jamie's nuts.
9310009	9311629	If anybody remembers that, I'm like, what?
9311709	9312169	Huh?
9312309	9312630	Huh?
9312750	9313150	Huh?
9313170	9313810	Episode 22.
9314430	9318211	My God, you are a living library of this damn show.
9318251	9318791	That's right.
9318831	9319292	I love it.
9319332	9320032	He's our archivist.
9320132	9320492	All right.
9321226	9322627	Dork, thanks for playing.
9323128	9326931	But also, you do get a second prize for winning tonight, Dork.
9326951	9327571	You know what that is?
9329272	9329412	Air?
9329853	9330894	No, you get hung up on.
9331854	9332195	All right.
9332215	9335517	Hey, I got a prize Dork could have.
9335838	9336318	Oh, what's that?
9336358	9345245	When I get home, he could spend like an hour in private instant message with me and I could disturb him and give him bad dreams and torment his mind to where he never wants to listen to LR again.
9345665	9346086	All right.
9346246	9347387	At least not while I'm on the show.
9347427	9348688	Just find Dark Child.
9348708	9350089	Dark Child, do you want to give out your email?
9350229	9350329	No.
9351104	9358369	My email is dchild999, that's spelled D-C-H-Y-L-D-E, 999 at yahoo.com.
9358570	9358950	All right.
9361171	9363733	I was so mean when I did the dork, but it was hilarious at the same time.
9364174	9364454	All right.
9364554	9365675	It's because we love you.
9365875	9367716	We do love dork, but we love Kyle too.
9367756	9368377	We love Kyle too.
9369739	9373720	In fact, don't we have like a Kyle remix on your computer?
9374300	9380622	Okay, as a treat to Kyle for coming in second place, we will play one second of one of his remixes.
9380682	9382143	So here it is, one second.
9382803	9383583	Play the whole song.
9384503	9386284	We get one second because we're running out of show.
9386344	9387564	Here it is, one second.
9388124	9388484	There it is.
9389044	9389965	There it is, one second.
9389985	9390365	There it was.
9393606	9393886	All right.
9394906	9397787	No, maybe we'll play the full thing on a later day when we have more time.
9398779	9400861	That was kind of like almost having a laryngism.
9402001	9403042	It was a great drumroll.
9403202	9403742	It was great.
9403822	9407565	You know, Poto, that's okay if you fill it with spam, because that is my spam email address.
9409806	9410146	All right.
9412608	9415330	The chatroom is demanding a reverse cage match in the near future.
9415350	9416210	We're going to have to do one of those.
9417331	9422254	I was going to mention, since he was mentioning disturbing stuff, I'm building my device this week.
9423415	9424815	Oh, you're going to contact the dead.
9424835	9425296	Yeah.
9425316	9425616	Yeah.
9427031	9428933	I have to use that magnet wire for something.
9429213	9430934	I'm glad I won't be here for that show.
9434117	9435759	Isn't that like that movie Prince of Darkness?
9436700	9436940	Huh?
9437140	9437941	Do you remember that movie?
9438441	9438581	No.
9438982	9439222	No?
9439622	9440863	I gotta get that.
9440923	9441664	Prince of Darkness.
9441784	9444586	It's like another talking to the dead.
9444767	9446148	Actually, we're talking to the future or something.
9446889	9448970	He can listen to the dead and hear them talk shit about him.
9449751	9451693	Can I help you test your machine, Loki?
9452694	9453194	Sure.
9453594	9454015	I mean,
9454902	9457723	I could go into the next world and try and talk to you back.
9460365	9463366	We need to do our FUs because we haven't done those.
9463726	9465447	And we are running on a limited schedule.
9465907	9466327	I agree.
9466367	9467828	We're not going to take a break.
9467848	9469609	We're going to go right into tonight's FUs.
9469669	9473610	So go ahead and send those over private message to Sky in the chat room.
9473630	9474651	Please keep them short.
9474691	9477092	We have lots of people that want to get read tonight.
9477172	9479513	So keep them short or you're not getting read.
9479898	9480538	Alright, here we go.
9481699	9483620	Jamie, why do we do the FUs of the Week here?
9483980	9502109	Because we're full of angst.
9503269	9507531	My first FU of the Week goes towards the several number of people who tried to run me off the road today.
9508051	9508612	Also to...
9509847	9518631	You know what, I don't have a problem with old people usually, but I have a problem with them driving when they drive 30 miles under the speed limit, and that is not an exaggeration.
9518731	9525514	They were, it was a freaking 50 mile, no, they were driving 25 under the speed limit, I'm sorry.
9525874	9527555	They were creeping down the road.
9527595	9529636	This is like, slow.
9529856	9532157	It's annoying, let alone dangerous.
9533058	9535619	Well, another...
9537774	9543455	Another FU goes to, uh, me not being able to get my laptop so soon.
9544396	9547076	But then again, I'm doing the responsible thing, you know.
9547836	9550237	Um, finally got the AC fixed in my apartment.
9550397	9551037	Yay!
9551097	9554138	So I retract my FU to the apartment managers.
9554938	9556919	Although we nearly withheld our rent because of that.
9557219	9563220	Um, another FU goes to my arms for hurting so freaking bad right now.
9563780	9565941	But, you know, that'll be over in a couple days.
9566301	9566381	Um,
9567694	9571917	Really, I'm not as full of the angst as I was just because I have AC in my house now.
9572157	9572757	Very good.
9572837	9573858	And the weather's cooling off.
9573918	9575499	It's supposed to be in the 70s this upcoming week.
9575859	9576460	No way!
9576480	9577420	Awesome.
9578381	9583024	Oh, another F you goes to Hurricane Ivan for existing.
9583965	9587807	And, of course, it's going to be heading right on toward my family.
9587967	9589308	Yeah.
9590309	9592050	Well, sometimes we have to deal with Mother Nature.
9592770	9596933	And I have another one, but it's very vague.
9598072	9602295	People have been bringing up obscure stuff that's sort of making me scratch my head lately.
9603515	9608838	Not like bad obscure things, but just like things I'm like, uh, uh, regarding, you know?
9609539	9612821	Like, it happens at work, it happens at home.
9614322	9614922	And you know what?
9615022	9619645	If you're going to bring up an obscure reference, make sure I know what the fuck the reference is before you bring it up.
9620245	9623667	Dan said something the other day that just, I was like, what?
9624788	9626749	And so, yeah, it's on.
9627895	9629216	So, that's it.
9631037	9634280	Alright, let's move on to the ever-so-loving Loki.
9638803	9650852	Um, yeah, fuck you to Benihana's, because I wanted to go eat there at that establishment on my birthday, but, um, they said, okay, so first we had to, you know, they said make a reservation.
9651233	9653054	The earliest time they had was nine.
9653294	9655756	I was like, fuck that, I don't want to eat at nine, I want to eat at six.
9656141	9659283	So they're like, fine, come on down, and you'll just have to wait.
9659483	9662645	You'll have to wait a few minutes or whatever to get in there.
9662825	9665466	I was like, yeah, that's fine, it's a Saturday, you have to wait everywhere.
9665846	9669749	So we went in there, we're like, yeah, we want a table for six people.
9670069	9671790	So how long is it going to be?
9672830	9674411	Well, nine, ten.
9675652	9681175	So fuck them for wasting my time, for telling me that I had to wait three hours for a fucking table.
9682616	9684997	So, yeah, that fucking sucks.
9685809	9691115	and, um, I don't know, that's pretty much all I have is, uh, just Benihana because they pissed me off.
9691615	9696881	You know, and, um, I just hope I don't get killed by a tree falling over outside because there's an awful lot of them.
9696901	9698703	They're just, limbs are falling off.
9700505	9700825	That's all.
9701225	9701766	I'm keeping it short.
9710020	9711181	No, they get worse.
9711642	9716887	My turn, and I would like to give an FU to my dad's laptop that he just got from my brother.
9717287	9718448	The piece of shit doesn't work.
9718468	9720870	I was so excited because my dad was like, Sure, son!
9721211	9723853	You can take this laptop to Pennsylvania with you.
9724233	9725995	Just don't put any pornography on it.
9728057	9728618	That's my dad.
9728658	9729599	He sounds like one of the Muppets.
9730239	9733182	But... He... Yeah.
9734499	9737701	He said I could take his laptop, but I had to just install Windows on it.
9737761	9739502	Okay, I know how to install Windows on a machine.
9739942	9743804	Well, Windows wouldn't install on this machine because the fucking hard drive was broken.
9744084	9748386	And it would only recognize that there was a hard drive in there with a size of 16 kilobytes.
9749406	9749847	You know what?
9750167	9750307	What?
9750327	9751768	Too bad you didn't talk to Julie.
9752408	9755970	Because she's had that same problem before and got Windows loaded up by doing it through network.
9756130	9756950	God damn it!
9758251	9763233	It's alright, that thing didn't have a network adapter on it and I didn't feel like buying one, so... Fuck the laptop!
9763979	9766962	and fuck the fact that I will have no way of communicating with my friends back home.
9767002	9767402	No, I'm kidding.
9767422	9770666	I have a cell phone and everybody better call me after 6 o'clock your time.
9771847	9774769	And I'll be updating my photo blog lots and lots from Philadelphia.
9775710	9777072	Not Philadelphia, but Allentown where I'm going.
9778553	9785360	And a preemptive FU to the New Jersey DDR crowd because they will all be better than me, I'm sure.
9787583	9792226	No, seriously, I was looking at some of the DDR pictures on Freak and stuff, and I'm kind of scared.
9792907	9795648	I hope people don't expect me to be good at DDR just because I have this show.
9796209	9798030	All right.
9798110	9800171	Let's move on to Darkchild.
9800352	9801773	Dare I let him have a chance?
9801973	9803234	I'm going to try and keep it short.
9803354	9808437	I mean, there's still the usual fuck yous to basically the entire White House staff right now in Bush.
9809057	9814261	But fuck you to my back for not being better because I can't do shit with an injured back.
9814301	9817323	No one wants to hire me because I'm either a liability or can't lift shit.
9818120	9820261	Fuck you to Workman's Comp for not giving me any money.
9820341	9823442	Fuck you to the laws that are in place right now because they fuck over victims.
9823802	9827104	Fuck you to Sack PD for not responding when my car was broken into.
9827484	9830005	Fuck you to the bastards who broke into my car and stole my stereo.
9830045	9833507	I'm a poor bitch just like you guys are, so please don't steal from me.
9834207	9843891	And a big fuck you to all those French haters right now that keep talking shit about, oh, France this, France fucking this, wasn't saving their ass in World War I and II good enough for them.
9844363	9849905	People tend to forget that when we were trying to get away from England way back when, that the French came and saved our asses.
9850305	9865569	Doesn't anybody pay attention in school?
9866529	9867289	Long time ago.
9868050	9871691	I just hate people who bash the French just because they don't want to go into this war.
9871931	9873011	I think this war is stupid.
9873450	9877692	I think the French made a good call, but, uh, I'd like to order some Freedom Fries, please.
9878352	9880633	I'd like to bash the French for being smelly.
9881414	9883735	See, that's alright, because they do smell a little bit.
9884195	9887216	But, I mean, don't talk shit like, oh, we saved their ass in World War II.
9887236	9888437	Wasn't that good enough for them?
9888977	9889977	Why can't they help us?
9890017	9890718	Why are they talking shit?
9890778	9892598	It's because Bush fucking sucks.
9893219	9893959	Here's another thing.
9894159	9895420	We didn't do that.
9896020	9898801	Your daddies and granddaddies who were in the military did it.
9899682	9900142	Or whatever.
9900622	9902863	And, uh, yeah, I hate Republicans, and
9903359	9904399	I hate Democrats too.
9904860	9906160	I hate third party now too.
9906540	9914603	Fuck you to Nader or whatever his name is because his campaign now is trying to get Bush re-elected instead of trying to get him elected president.
9915104	9917004	What kind of presidential campaign is that?
9917104	9918745	Trying to get someone else elected president.
9920111	9921752	I hate all politics.
9922372	9924293	I'm non-partisan in case you guys are wondering.
9924333	9925554	I don't belong to any party.
9925754	9926254	Fuck them all.
9926294	9928955	You should start that, the fuck them all party.
9930576	9934618	I usually vote for the Radical Meadow Party for Bill the Cat and Opus.
9936719	9937499	The Alcoholic.
9939060	9941261	I just want to say fuck you to Comcast again.
9942461	9942901	No, wait.
9943001	9943682	No, SBC.
9943742	9944182	I'm sorry.
9944482	9944962	SBC.
9945062	9946763	Actually, Comcast didn't do too bad this week.
9947461	9953527	SBC has been calling us incessantly, telling us that we should get SBC DSL.
9953907	9955469	It's just as good as cable, right?
9955949	9958571	It's cheaper than cable internet.
9958932	9963256	So we finally gave in and said okay, because they told us we do have service in our area.
9964076	9966459	Then they told us we don't have service in our area.
9966959	9972084	Then they called us back again and told us we do have service in our area, and had us actually sign up this time.
9972535	9999792	And then they had somebody almost out to give us all our service and everything And then they called back again and told us we don't have service in the area So they just gave us a run around I just have to jump in on this one because Anita doesn't know all of it They actually called, told me it was available Called a week later, not available Called, it was available A week later, not available Called, it was available Called again, a couple days later, not available Called again, it was available I had her triple check it on the phone
10000233	10002434	She said it was available, so I signed up.
10002855	10007158	So it was like three or four times they called to tell me it was available, then not available in my area.
10007738	10009839	Fucking get your facts straight.
10009919	10011901	Did I be writing a letter to the Better Business Bureau?
10012821	10013942	Yeah, something's gotta be done.
10013962	10015043	It's crazy.
10016364	10018005	Alright, DDR Angel, your FUs.
10018145	10024949	Alright, people have been keeping tabs on my lab journal for those people that, you know, are on it, on my friends list and stuff.
10025390	10026791	You guys know where this is coming from.
10027691	10030053	Big fat fucking FU to Hurricane Ivan.

10063572	10064092	So you know what?
10064752	10065673	Put that check in the mail.
10067093	10070235	And please say Comcast isn't going to screw me this week.
10071295	10071695	Alright.
10072016	10077758	Let's get to our chatroom FUs, and God, hopefully it gets them off politics, because that's all they're talking about right now.
10078319	10079599	We're not a political show!
10080039	10080440	God.
10081060	10082200	Tell dick and fart jokes.
10082220	10085142	Sigh.
10087148	10093493	Fuck you to myself for not going to JTAF this weekend because I did really want to go, but I just had other shit come up, so I didn't go.
10095614	10096575	I wanted to add that in there.
10096775	10097456	That was myself.

10186919	10191141	Sigurd says, F you to the damn chatroom for picking the wrong song in Cage Match.

10210865	10211546	F you to my job.
10211606	10217050	My boss has gotten to the point of not telling me what actual time I'll be working until five minutes before I punch out.
10218075	10219697	F you to some of the people I have to work with.

10226566	10228889	I swear I'm moving to Canada if Bush gets re-elected.
10230491	10231612	I've heard a lot of people say that.
10231632	10233314	That would be very interesting if that happened.
10234335	10236378	Zaku says, my F yous for the week.
10237273	10239674	FU to our government for not catching Osama Bin Laden.

10245378	10251541	FU to State University of New York's University Police for being dicks and shutting down unregistered parties this weekend at my campus.
10252502	10254643	Sky, the second FU is a freestyle routine.
10254663	10255464	Just making a note of that.
10255744	10256364	Okay, you got it.
10257585	10259606	Jazz says, FU to my mom's driving.

10263999	10269464	Silent Ben says, hints about what's going on on Friday.
10269504	10270485	I thought it was an FU.
10271305	10274328	Esko says, FU to all the telemarketers calling recently.
10274728	10275949	I have a new strategy, though.
10276089	10277631	Skype me to check it out.
10278131	10280013	No, I actually, can I make a mention?
10280473	10280653	Sure.
10280673	10283256	Whenever a telemarketer calls you, tell them to opt you out.
10283756	10285938	Under federal law, they actually have to take off their dialogue.
10286460	10294905	I have to admit, even though he's already been on the show once tonight, I'm just too damn curious on what the hell's going on with this telemarketer thing.
10295505	10297906	We have a telemarketer that keeps calling us, too.
10297927	10302049	See, with telemarketers, I think you should just say, Oh, hang on, let me get the person in charge of the account.
10302429	10304030	And just set the phone down and leave it.
10304070	10304870	I'm going to see if it picks up.
10309893	10311154	God damn it, answer your phone.
10315734	10316194	Ring, ring.
10317655	10318135	Ring, ring.
10318275	10319276	He said Skype him.
10319316	10319836	Here I am.
10322657	10323117	Hello?
10323738	10324878	Hello, sir!
10324998	10326839	Would you like to take our survey?
10328040	10329640	Uh, um, uh, sure.
10330361	10332642	No, seriously, what's your strategy for telemarketers?
10333462	10333582	Oh.
10334122	10335023	Well, I was trying it.
10335063	10335743	I was trying it.
10335823	10336363	Oh, I'm sorry.
10337104	10339545	Yeah, I had, like, a whole thing... Sky, you ruined it all.
10339605	10340005	Goddammit!
10340045	10340565	Okay, sorry.
10340625	10341065	Rewind.
10341546	10342626	Ruined it all up, Sky!
10343106	10344447	Would you like to take a survey?
10345222	10346743	I had the band ready.
10346763	10349424	Yeah, you were supposed to do that.
10351765	10352846	What the hell's going on?
10357148	10358069	Are you happy, Sky?
10358649	10359309	Yeah, I guess.
10359329	10359990	Who's yelling?
10360030	10360610	What the hell?
10363111	10364012	What's the strategy?
10364092	10364812	Tell me the strategy.
10366513	10367433	What is the Matrix?
10368094	10369114	Excuse me?
10369494	10370335	What is the strategy?
10370515	10371335	What is the Matrix?
10372476	10373296	The Matrix?
10373557	10374297	Or the strategy?
10375355	10379759	Um... You know, I've completely forgotten what it was after all.
10380119	10380859	But you know what?
10381380	10382080	It doesn't matter.
10382420	10383661	It's all about spontaneity.
10384102	10386984	So... Yeah.
10388385	10389145	I'm hanging up on you.
10389505	10391227	I think he's just a Skype whore.
10391247	10391987	I think he is too.
10392007	10393949	He just wants to be on Skype as much as possible.
10394249	10396811	You Skype whore, you need to go to Skypers Anonymous.
10397171	10400113	Get some treatment, because you have a major Skype problem.
10400953	10404516	I just wanted to hang up on somebody else, so Dork doesn't feel so bad, so I hung up on him.
10405322	10405722	Alright.
10407844	10408865	I guess I fucked that up.
10408905	10409306	My bad.
10413790	10414550	Is that all the FUs?
10415091	10415571	I guess so.
10415611	10416532	That was all the FUs.
10416852	10417213	Hey.

10425800	10427141	He made some changes again.
10427882	10430064	You know, he needs to learn to keep the movies the way they were.
10430104	10431205	They're classics for a reason.
10432023	10435906	and then my other fuck you I kind of forgot.
10436006	10438368	So, fuck you to forgetting my fuck you.
10440129	10444652	I think we will take a really quick break and then we're going to come back and wrap up this show.
10444892	10445593	Wait, wait, wait, Rob.
10445633	10447954	Or do you want to just do some Ask Orange Launch here real fast?

10450436	10458562	Alright, if anybody's a Star Wars fan out there, Lucas has announced 7, 8, 9 Star Wars.
10461522	10466686	Episode 7, 8, and 9 So I don't know if Loki's heard about that or not Does Loki even like Star Wars?

10537603	10539704	Alright, you go... Were you sleeping?
10541005	10541425	Kinda.
10541665	10543606	God, I feel like a real dick now.
10544467	10545728	Yeah.
10545788	10547329	Hugs and kisses from us to you.
10547349	10548769	Alright.
10548829	10549370	Feel better.
10549390	10549710	I'm cold.
10551448	10552268	God, we're bastards.
10573309	10575411	If I didn't want to get called, I'd turn the damn thing off.
10575991	10577793	Turn on your computer answering machine.
10577953	10579194	I feel like a dick.
10579374	10580075	What?
10580095	10580575	What?
10580615	10581155	What?
10581175	10581776	What?
10581816	10582396	What?
10582416	10582617	What?
10583037	10583837	What?
10583858	10584058	What?
10586600	10587180	What?
10587220	10594025	Of course the whole chat room is going, Sky got owned, oh my god you're so mean Rob, Rob is evil, prank call me.
10595647	10597929	It's not a prank call if you expect it.
10597949	10599650	Yeah, it wasn't a prank call, we just, you know.
10601141	10602362	We announced who we were.
10602482	10603542	We said what we wanted.
10603562	10606524	Do you have a Seymour, Seymour Buds?
10608125	10609606	I want a Seymour Buds!
10612708	10615750	I'm looking for Oliver, last name, close off.
10618952	10619612	You want to know what?
10620132	10620352	What?
10620593	10622994	I knew somebody in high school named Benjamin Dover.
10623706	10625227	I knew someone named Peter Spank.
10626727	10629228	His middle name was Martin, so his initials were PMS.
10629948	10630549	That's funny.
10630849	10632569	You know his parents did that intentionally.
10634970	10636091	I knew someone named Bendover.
10637191	10637911	Dead air.
10638471	10638972	All right.
10639592	10642913	I think it's time to put the nail in the coffin of this train wreck of a show.
10643213	10646034	Well, you know, I could have just filled up dead air with more fuck you.
10646054	10646634	That's all right.
10646695	10647515	Let's go ahead.
10647675	10647795	Oh.
10648427	10649828	Hi, Unknown Gamer!
10650068	10653651	Our bestest friend in the whole wide world who's come to bit us out, I'm sure.
10653671	10654292	Yeah, that's okay.
10654352	10657574	You can lash out just like everybody else in the chat room did.
10657714	10658575	Hey, Unknown Gamer.
10658595	10659335	They got your back.
10659656	10663118	Unknown Gamer, if you were asleep, how'd you answer your computer?
10663939	10665720	He sounded kind of asleep.
10667582	10668783	I think he was getting busy.
10669663	10671725	I know, I totally think we interrupted sex.
10671765	10673146	We interrupted some hot niggas.
10673166	10675688	Hey, if I was getting some, I would not answer Skype.
10676620	10679202	Or if I answer it, I just answer it and leave it off the hook.
10680083	10680443	Alright.
10681044	10681484	God.
10682865	10683926	Oh, we're so rude.
10684066	10686528	Alright, let's finish up the show and get our final thoughts.

10709853	10711354	and, uh, Loki, your final thought.
10713556	10717880	I need to find a good LCD screen for my portable computer.

10978860	10980942	Orange Lounge Radio Afterbirth In Process
11003226	11005068	One day we'll look back on this and laugh.
11006089	11008071	But in the meantime, I'm going out of state tomorrow.
11010093	11010734	No worries.
11010774	11011495	So who cares?
11011555	11012916	I just thought of something.
11013096	11013337	What?
11013577	11015179	Pennsylvania's near the coast.
11015499	11016200	Kind of.
11017241	11017481	Ouch.
11018863	11021686	Oh shit, one of my fellow DJs is going to be in trouble too then.
11024117	11031300	I'm not too worried about that hurricane thingy, whatever, because I don't think it really floods where I'm at, and I'll be on the second floor of the hotel anyway.
11031841	11032561	It's Pennsylvania.
11033682	11034182	I'll be okay.
11034582	11036183	Of course, you're just going to get the rain part of it, I think.
11036523	11036803	Alright.
11040788	11043369	Wowie wow, I don't know what else to say during the afterbirth.
11043589	11048090	Why don't you tell us, you were just talking to us during the break while the credits were rolling there.
11048110	11049171	You were telling us, D.R.
11049191	11052612	Golic, about a club you were forming and a poll you were doing.
11052632	11053752	I want to hear more about this.
11053832	11056033	Tell our listeners about this because there might be other people interested.
11056273	11067957	Yeah, well, my live journal earlier this week, actually I think it started last week, I put up a poll with two questions about Street Fighter, the Japanese movie.
11068844	11070864	First question was, have you seen Street Fighter?
11071885	11075986	And the second question was, do you know who Sonny Chiba, or what do you think about Sonny Chiba?
11076346	11091989	So, Street Fighter is a movie that came out back in the 70s, it was either 1973 or 74, starring Sonny Chiba, who's a very big martial arts actor in Asian circles and overseas.
11092069	11097630	He's just now starting to become fairly popular here because of Kill Bill, and he's
11098101	11098601	Absolutely.
11098621	11101063	Yeah, he's an amazing actor.
11101423	11103745	He's an excellent martial artist.
11104305	11106587	He's well trained in martial arts.
11107327	11112931	And I just saw Street Fighter two weeks ago and it was just a trip.
11113071	11113631	I loved it.
11113752	11115533	And I just wanted to share that with people.
11116013	11118094	I wanted to see if other people might be interested.
11118515	11119515	I wanted to watch it.
11119876	11126200	And I would totally, if I could, and I had the know-how, I would totally start a Sonny Chiba fan club.
11127565	11129367	You could always start one on the internet.
11129787	11131288	Yeah.
11131788	11133449	I've started to look to see if there is one.
11133469	11134310	I don't see there's any one.
11134330	11135391	That's what the internet's for.
11135431	11136732	Pornography and fan clubs.
11136892	11138873	Yeah.
11139033	11140114	I've found a fan listing.
11140154	11142576	We have the advantage of being a little bit of both, actually.
11143817	11145778	A little bit of both?
11145818	11149200	Here at Orange Sounds Radio, we are a fan club and a little bit of pornography.
11152483	11152943	Oh, that's...
11154358	11156239	Weird, but it's true.
11156619	11157079	It is true.
11157099	11157820	Sadly true.
11158880	11162862	So, anybody out there have any words for Street Fighter or Sonny Chiba?
11163802	11164863	Well, we're looking at his chat room.
11164883	11168865	Dude, he's so hot.
11168905	11175608	How about, if you like ninja movies, he has been in some of the best ninja productions ever.
11175888	11178109	I wanted to see the TV series he did.
11178229	11179790	Yeah, the Kagen no Gundan.
11179950	11180310	Yeah.
11180770	11181651	Oh, I love it.
11181731	11182411	I love it so much.
11183260	11186242	By the way, if we ever get to do that, I'll watch it.
11187943	11188263	Cool.
11188323	11188583	Awesome.
11188603	11190685	I need to find something that's going to poke a hole in my belt.
11191845	11194127	I don't want to go spend 20 bucks on a new belt.
11194367	11194787	Ice pick.
11195648	11196408	Do you have an ice pick?
11198449	11199510	Just don't use a penknife.
11199570	11201391	I've heard really bad stories about that one.
11206914	11209056	Okay, I'm going home.
11209076	11209216	Bye.
11209896	11210457	Oh, no.
11211437	11212558	Oh, we have to say bye-bye.
11214117	11214717	Thank you for watching!
11239281	11241623	and I'm going to miss you guys while I'm gone again.
11241723	11242323	Keep in touch.
11242763	11245245	I'll take very good care of your Silent Hill 4 for you.
11245305	11247726	For the love of God, don't ruin the show next week.
11247826	11248406	I'm just kidding.
11248746	11249987	We'll miss you too, Rob.
11250007	11251848	You guys coming back next week for the show?
11251948	11254489	Because DarkSakura and Loki need some people.
11254509	11256190	Okay, somebody has to kidnap me then.
11256631	11256911	Alright.
11258031	11258612	We'll be here then.
11258872	11260293	These people try to save me.
11260733	11261013	Huh?
11261233	11262334	These people try to save me.
11262714	11262974	Who?
11263374	11263654	Nothing.
11265555	11267476	You were listening to the fortune cookie then.
11268877	11270478	Oh, no, I'm sorry.
11271358	11272659	Went over my head a little there.
11274440	11275841	Well, not many things do.
11277522	11277902	All right.
11277922	11283325	Those of you guys in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, look out, because I'm coming.
11284045	11285126	I like to play DDR.
11285306	11285706	Yeah.
11286407	11287407	All right.
11287487	11289808	Post-show, commercial-free, but wanting music and more.
11289848	11290729	Have a good one, you guys.
