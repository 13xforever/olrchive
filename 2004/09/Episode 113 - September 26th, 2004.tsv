264442	265683	You got the shitty mic, just to warn you.
265703	267224	You gotta hold it at the bottom when you're talking it.
267504	267824	Careful.
267944	269685	I got the shitty mic right here.
269725	270486	You go, girl.
270646	271086	Yeah.
271146	275009	Alright.
275169	275489	Anyway.
275609	277450	Did they even get what I said or no?
277750	278791	Yes, they heard most of it.
282570	286652	I'm not going to go there.
287192	288273	Stop sending them hurricanes.
292615	295797	We had a really big show tonight, and I'm very disappointed.
295837	299379	We only have about half our usual listeners tuned in right now.
299519	300259	Shame on you!
300339	301120	You're watching football.
301140	304561	That was after I did the show last week.
304581	307143	They were all scared off from the Loki experience last week.
308519	308999	DDR Xtreme USA Music
338402	339803	and a whole lot of other Bomani news.
339823	340783	It's just been a busy week.
341304	344686	God, we might have to actually stay on topic tonight.
345966	346286	No.
346887	357633	You're right, but first we're going to do How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day when we get back from this break featuring licensed music from DDR Extreme USA including what I believe would be Jamie's favorite licensed song.
359594	362336	It's an old 80s song by a British lady.
363096	363996	She's a little wild.
364937	365577	Alright, here it is.
365737	366078	Enjoy.
366118	366558	We'll be back.

634803	641686	Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.
665671	674033	We are back with Orange Lounge Radio, and of course tonight, big news, lots of news in the video game world this week.
674053	681576	There was a game that came out that we've all finally been looking forward to, and thusly, we're going to dedicate tonight's entire show to this game.
681996	684376	Hooray for Final Fantasy XI Chains of Promethea.
684516	686277	No, no bullshit.
686857	687798	It's been two.
690466	691407	No way.
691467	692449	I like both of those.
692689	693430	I need The Sims 2.
693491	697036	You need to kill them in more original ways and better graphics.
697237	702345	A certain former intern of ours has my copies and claims to have lost them.
702686	702926	Dope.
706830	711054	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
727006	728126	I just thought it was hilarious.
728206	734668	I think it's great that you can kind of just whisk yourself away into the imaginary world of Sims 2 where you can live out your sexual fantasies.
735568	738289	I am going to kill the Olsen twins in a pool.
738989	740329	That's going to be awesome.
741129	741990	I can't wait.
746191	752152	I want to build the house of all pool so I can take all the people I hate and have them drown there.
752882	756783	Alright, Sigurd's posting in the chatroom that it was him, so I can say it was Sigurd.
756863	759383	Sigurd sent me all these pictures of him living out his fantasy.
760744	768505	Anyway, you can, um, what's great is, I, like, saw, did a review on somethingawful.com about it, and apparently there's, like, three different cities you can start in.
768585	772846	One's, like, completely medieval, and there's, like, some other strange one, and some other thing.
773046	777787	But what's cool, though, is you can make, like, three and four story tall buildings and stuff in this.
778047	778987	Can you push people off?
780020	783503	I don't know, but he had really creepy, fuzzy chairs.
785144	788226	And he kept all of the dead up in his, like, roof.
788507	791789	My question is if the Rosebud Code still works.
793371	794952	Oh, from the old-ass Sims City?
796473	796953	Good question.
796973	797994	I have a question.
798094	799996	You know how they had, like, a Sims that came out a while ago?
800016	801357	It was like the Sims Herbs.
801857	803919	Like, it was the urban version of the Sims.
804339	805320	It came out not that long ago.
805620	807502	I want to know if you have drive-bys in that game.
807562	808342	That would be awesome.
808422	809203	That would be awesome.
810678	812459	That's San Andreas.
813500	813960	Different game.
814360	815641	They need Grand Theft Sims.
815801	816541	That's what we need.
819803	823044	And then, yes, we do have to tip our hat.
823264	830068	Jamie doesn't have to tip her hat, but Matt and I have to tip our hats to Final Fantasy XI Chains of Promethea because we've been waiting for that game for a while.
830782	837246	I've had the game now for almost 48 hours, or at least 24 hours, and have not been to any of the new areas.
837987	839008	That's the beautiful part.
839108	845252	We've had the game for a day and a half, and it's been installed, and I have yet to see any differences except one new song.
847033	848854	Beautiful waste of $30.
849094	850896	You know what, dear, dear addicts?
851576	851856	Yes?
852837	855199	I'm still playing Ragnarok Online for free!
857320	858781	Zelda Online, they do have...
860891	861752	It's so cool!
862772	865954	I could go play the Satella view, Zelda, on my computer.
866155	867275	And I have to deal with people.
868176	868636	Whatever.
870097	871338	Anyway, we're getting off subject.
871378	877302	We have to go back to our roots, and we have to do what this show is all about in the beginnings of the first chapter.
878563	879023	No, not that.
879063	879483	Not that yet.
880044	883886	But, um, we have to do... The Athens game, I know.
884727	885007	No, no.
885187	885728	How was your week?
885768	886328	How was your day?
886768	887909	The greatest game of all time.
888329	889130	Oh, okay.
889330	890171	Jamie, how was your week?
890211	890611	How was your day?
891550	897573	Last week, not this like very past, but the week before, I was... Sorry, how was your two weeks?
897633	898073	How was your day?
898173	899234	I was a wreck.
900415	902816	Because the hurricane hit Mobile, Alabama.
903256	904056	Guess where I'm from?
905397	906298	I'll take Mobile for $200.
906498	907498	I'm not from Kansas.
907938	908459	Anymore.
908659	909039	Anymore.
910940	912221	As if I ever was.
912501	916623	Anyway, yeah, I was up that Wednesday night just watching the news.
916923	919704	Because they had a live feed from one of the local stations in Mobile.
919724	920505	So I was watching...
921070	922011	Yeah, the pressure, yeah.
922311	922631	So, uh...
948772	959814	But luckily, when the north eyewall was going to hit Mobile Bay, and they were expecting it to surge all the water up through the bay and flood all of downtown, you know, hence Water Street.
960415	967556	But instead it sucked out all the water, so it's kind of stunk there for a little bit, but there wasn't any extraneous flooding.
968136	971297	It blew over a bunch of stuff, knocked down some trees, but there were no casualties in Mobile.
972357	972937	That's good.
973117	975778	And there were no serious injuries reported.
975798	976078	Mm-hmm.
976331	980212	However, Tornadoes decided to drop down in the town I was born in, in Dothan, Alabama.
980352	980572	Dope.
981012	982053	Tore up a bunch of trailer parks.
983013	984473	And nearly hit my granny's house.
985934	987694	It still dealt like a block from her house.
987914	988435	But it missed her?
988755	989095	It missed her.
989115	989495	That's good.
989515	991976	You have a hit movie gallery.
992996	996277	Their headquarters happens to be in Dothan, Alabama, and I fucking hate them.
996670	1002873	Dude, I used to go to, like, one of the movie galleries out there that were, like, the crappiest place in the world.
1002893	1003933	They are the crappiest place.
1003953	1010917	They buy out mom-and-pop stores that replace all the employees with retards, and then they just, like, run the business.
1011117	1012678	So, you're missing movies, right?
1012938	1015639	Yeah, well, we've only checked the first box so far.
1017020	1018200	Well, why don't you check the second box?
1018240	1019081	Maybe that's where your movies are.
1019341	1019601	Oh, yeah.
1020251	1032214	On a serious note, before Jamie gets back to her story, just, you know, we hope that all you guys are safe from Ivan, and we hope everything's alright with you guys, our thoughts are with you guys, and if you're in Florida right now, RUN!
1032754	1033514	RUN AWAY!
1034335	1035595	THERE'S A HURRICANE COMING!
1037135	1038836	PICK UP YOUR PLAYSTATION AND RUN!
1040236	1042577	No, seriously, we hope everything's alright with you guys.
1042597	1047758	This has just been sort of, I mean, it hasn't ever happened like this before.
1048414	1050516	Unless your last name is Bush, then by all means, stay.
1052257	1066748	You know what, at this point though, after having a whole week filled with seeing the debates between those two particular presidential candidates, and by the way people, more than two people are running for the presidency, hello!
1067288	1069090	There are other parties to choose from.
1069250	1072873	That'll never... That's because people are stupid.
1073473	1075875	It's more like jogging, or brisk walking.
1077782	1078002	What?
1079003	1080203	It's like Coke and Pepsi.
1080504	1082124	You can drink other sodas.
1082205	1082605	Hello.
1083905	1086527	Shasta and Fanta and Bosco.
1087908	1088408	Those are good.
1089709	1090509	You can drink root beer.
1090809	1092030	You don't have to drink Sprite or Coke.
1093311	1094592	But anyway, yeah.
1096633	1101495	So I've just decided that neither candidate is worth my precious vote.
1102156	1103517	So I want them both to burn in hell.
1105198	1105898	I vote for Billy Capp.
1106539	1108060	Oh hell yeah, I'm voting for Build-A-Cat.
1108440	1113664	Although, something that was in, I've actually put a link up in my live journal a couple days ago.
1114184	1118287	Apparently, there's a couple other candidates, but I'll mention that later.
1119027	1120448	That I would be considered voting for.
1120929	1121269	Alright.
1121969	1122970	I might vote for the gay penguin.
1125592	1129594	But nah, I'm voting for Build-A-Cat and Opus, Radical Meadow Party.
1130195	1133557	Like I always do, because there's never been anybody worth voting for.
1134249	1136049	I have to remember to turn in my registration form.
1136629	1137410	I have to mail it back.
1138410	1139550	I know, shame on me, because I've moved.
1141110	1145071	But I otherwise went to school, yay.
1145711	1146991	Did homework, yay.
1147031	1148431	We got slow at work, finally.
1149032	1150932	So I've been writing fanfiction at work.
1151452	1151932	Productive.
1151952	1153112	Because I'm bored.
1153972	1155793	I don't know, I've been doing other stuff, too.
1156073	1162294	And today, Dan and I had a very interesting conversation about that supposed draft coming up for vote.
1165183	1172447	First of all, I don't think that anyone needs to worry about it, because how many years have they tried to bring it back and not enacted it?
1173288	1188137	But even so, I mean, where it's not good for the forward-thinking, general, middle-class people, it would be a really good thing, though, for all of the people who are out there, like,
1189947	1192589	I will become gay not to go in the military.
1192609	1193070	I will take one.
1216880	1222866	There's going to be... I'm just saying, if they do bring back the draft, there's going to be a... It's going to be the new fad.
1222926	1225588	Instead of moving to Canada, everybody's going to start sucking dick.
1225609	1233076	I mean, that's going to be... There's going to be this big, huge inconsistency that's going to have to be addressed at some point.
1233116	1235938	Well, I don't think it's going to be... Overall, it's going to be good for...
1236799	1245428	Good for the military itself, you know, to have a bunch of people there who they're not going to have time and resources to train properly and who aren't going to really want to be there.
1246168	1259121	But on the other hand, you know, for, especially for larger cities that are dealing with, you know, high crime, you know, high, I'm trying to, right now I just lost the word I was thinking of.
1259986	1270154	But overall, I think that it could improve things on a social scale, but there's so many drawbacks to it otherwise, I don't know that I'd be able to support anything like it.
1270355	1271375	But my fiancé's all for it.
1271956	1275479	I told him they should have made it 30 so I could go.
1278021	1283626	I'd freaking volunteer, I don't care, except we've got that little issue with me and him right now about it.
1284486	1285107	I'm working on it.
1285587	1286628	We'll see what happens.
1287068	1287589	I'm working on it.
1288329	1289010	Anything else you want to share?
1290180	1291861	No, except Dark Knight is pretty damn funny.
1319266	1322189	by the doctor to fix my ingrown toenail.
1322209	1323250	Was he the evil doctor?
1323470	1324351	No, he wasn't an evil doctor.
1324371	1325252	It only took a couple minutes.
1325512	1326373	But it hurts like a bitch.
1326633	1327794	He wasn't even moderately evil?
1328875	1329175	Maybe.
1330136	1335181	He talked about... What was he... He was rambling on about something that was like mad cow disease, but it was in deer.
1335681	1337103	So I guess mad deer disease.
1337303	1338163	I don't know what the hell.
1338864	1345070	Anyways, this is something like... Something to keep me focused on something other than, you know, them...
1345720	1347441	Poking my foot with needles.
1347701	1347821	Ow.
1348281	1349161	Anyways.
1349542	1351642	And, yeah, so that hurts.
1351722	1352983	I've been hobbling around for days.
1353343	1356544	And I just, today I ripped the bandage off because I'm supposed to.
1357004	1370950	Apparently I forgot a process of the bandage ripping off where I'm supposed to soak my toe in cold water and a little bit of hydrogen peroxide to loosen the impacted bandages in there.
1371430	1373631	Well, I forgot about that, so I just kind of pulled.
1374367	1403606	and with the polling came the yanking and then came the bleeding and that came the hurting so that really sucked and um so then there's that and then earlier this week I got DDR Extreme I did a show people got bored so I stopped the show and then I did a show last Sunday and people got bored and we did a segment called Crank Call Orange on his radio and I hung up on someone and that was funny and then um
1404898	1405238	What else?
1405398	1414525	Oh, yeah, and then, let's see, you got Chains of Promethea, didn't really do anything, leveled some characters, and played a lot of Final Fantasy because I couldn't really go out and be active.
1415846	1427815	Oh, and got a book about my device, the Skull Experiment is what the book's called, and read it, and apparently my device may be a little bit harder to get working than I thought, but that's okay.
1428376	1429096	I can still do it.
1431458	1432719	And that's it.
1434808	1437250	Oh, and I broke the lamp on Wednesday.
1437410	1438030	That was funny.
1440652	1440972	All right.
1441772	1442513	Angel, how was your week?
1442533	1442893	How was your day?
1444474	1444934	Pretty good.
1445715	1449237	Worked a lot and, you know, did what I was supposed to do.
1449717	1450558	Went to school.
1450658	1451538	School was okay.
1451578	1453419	School was, well, school.
1455000	1459523	And I actually got some good news from my folks, actually.
1460164	1464126	I called them on, what was it?
1466896	1485203	I had asked them if they had gotten hold of my brother and my sister-in-law and the baby and everything, and well, it turns out they're okay, so that was like a pressure off my shoulders that you wouldn't believe, except for you, Jamie, because, you know, your family and everything.
1485948	1507301	so, uh, yeah, that was just, I was just so thankful that, you know, the kid was okay, and, uh, their family's okay, and, yeah, so, that was, that was just the highlight of the week, pretty much, oh, yeah, and Extreme, and Andrew's command mission, oh, boy, Mega Man, more Mega Man, yay, oh, wait, if he was listening, oh, wait, he's not listening, haha, I'm safe,
1508032	1515438	See, I wanted to see, you know, I was waiting for, you know, a goddamn title match between Mike Tyson versus, you know, Hurricane Ivan.
1515918	1519961	Because I think that would be really sweet, and they could totally set that kind of stuff up.
1520081	1523324	So, you know, and Tyson's not doing anything.
1523404	1526166	He's just being bankrupt.
1526926	1527887	So, they could do it.
1529778	1533881	Yeah, and I'm probably going to get Final Fantasy XI this week, I guess.
1534962	1540247	And become the... I don't know, I'll probably be sucked up into it and stuff.
1541408	1541748	Maybe.
1543049	1544350	Or I'll just go back to there.
1545931	1546692	Or Ragnarok.
1548974	1552617	Or Ragnarok, or... God, I could just go anywhere, couldn't I?
1552797	1553838	Oh well, whatever.
1553978	1556540	Anyway, if anybody wants to know about there, go to there.com.
1557081	1558562	Yeah, okay, that's my little spiel.
1558582	1558842	Goodbye.
1560503	1560743	Thank you.
1560883	1561803	Bradley, do you have a mic over there?
1561923	1562263	Oh, goody.
1562603	1563283	Bradley, how was your week?
1563303	1563664	How was your day?
1563704	1563924	I do.
1564824	1566764	Alright, uh, this week was work, of course.
1567284	1574625	Uh, Wednesday I came over here and did the... played some DDR USA Extreme, or whatever it's called.
1575386	1576126	Extreme USA.
1576846	1578926	Wasn't particularly impressed, but it was alright.
1580386	1586287	Uh, then... And actually, I think that was the first time I played DDR in... in months.
1588228	1589228	Uh, let's see, then...
1590546	1591647	Saturday didn't do very much.
1592127	1602496	Got the thing about the initiatives for the state ballot on November and got to see the two that I had did the temp job with.
1602836	1614665	Because one of my temp jobs during November, March and April was basically checking petitions for the stem cell one and the lawsuits one.
1615746	1618328	I'd say, oh, there's what I was working on.
1618809	1619069	Huh.
1619909	1620469	which was interesting.
1621330	1632378	And then Thursday or Friday I had a bunch of old Best Buy gift certificates.
1632418	1640763	I went and got the Aqua Teen Hunger Force DVDs and watched that most of the time.
1640923	1641184	Cool.
1641424	1641864	Those are fun.
1643225	1644046	Today I didn't do very much.
1644246	1645507	I came here and that's all.
1647328	1647648	All right.
1648024	1652167	My week and my day, actually my past two weeks because I wasn't here on Sunday because I was on a business trip.
1652587	1658471	I was in the lovely town of Allentown, Pennsylvania, which is about an hour north of Philly, about an hour west of Jersey.
1660752	1662773	And, you know, just kind of did my thing there.
1663714	1665095	Didn't get to play a whole lot of DDR.
1665115	1670038	I was actually thinking I was going to get to go out and play more DDR, but I was still working a lot this time around and...
1670728	1674609	It was kind of one of those things where when I was done working at the end of the day, I didn't really want to go out.
1674669	1678310	I just kind of wanted to go back to my hotel and watch TV and sleep, so I didn't really do a whole lot.
1678350	1683311	But I did go out one night to a little mall out there in the area, which did have a DDR machine.
1683691	1686651	I was actually going to Walden Books there in the mall because I wanted to pick up some books.
1687311	1689732	But they happen to have a DDR machine, and you know me, I can't pass it up.
1690252	1694113	Actually, it was a Namco arcade, I believe, because they had Pac-Man stuff all over.
1696273	1697013	I can't remember the name of it.
1697073	1698154	Time something?
1698194	1699454	I don't know what the hell it was called.
1700152	1701214	Thank you for watching!
1721197	1726039	and it even impressed this one girl and she just started randomly talking to me and she's like, are you freaked out by strangers talking to you?
1726059	1726699	I'm like, not really.
1727000	1729901	I'm kind of lonely and sad because I'm by myself in a strange town.
1730501	1734824	But she talked to me a little bit and that was cool.
1735084	1736204	I didn't plug the show though.
1736325	1738126	Oh, you should listen to my radio show.
1739046	1740387	I know, bad me.
1741337	1751393	But then, okay, but then maybe I was just being an egotist or something, but I was looking at the scoreboards on the machine, and the Pop 4 difficult scores were kind of...
1752083	1762670	Eh, like I was like, I could get that, you know, like, and so I really wanted to do it, and not, I'm usually not a scoreboard whore, but how cool would it have been to have my name on a machine like thousands of miles away, right?
1762910	1774977	So I had to do it, so I put my coins in, I started to do it, and then the fucking pad, like, wouldn't work, like, it was just totally not registering, like, half my steps, and I fucking failed on, what, Irresistible Mind, like, standard, I failed that.
1777118	1778339	Oh well, what can you do?
1780579	1784517	So much for that, trying to get my name on the scoreboard at the Lehigh Valley Mall, but whatever.
1785415	1785896	That's alright.
1786156	1786496	It's alright.
1786556	1787857	It's just, you know, let that guy have it.
1787877	1788278	It's cool.
1790059	1794863	And over the weekend, I actually got to take a little bit of a tour of the East Coast a little more.
1794923	1798345	My friend came and picked me up, and we drove through New York City a little bit.
1798365	1802288	I didn't really stop to play DDR anymore until we were on the way back.
1803109	1812496	And I knew that there was an In the Groove machine in Jersey, and I thought, well, you know, we talk about it a lot on the show, and we've said a lot of judgments about it, but none of us have actually played it.
1812536	1813617	So I'm like, I better go play it
1814028	1821092	So therefore, I can give a fair review of the game and actually say, well, I've played it so that, you know, you can't say I'm just talking about my ass.
1821516	1823918	So I will tell you what I thought about that a little later.
1823998	1826920	But it was at this place called Eight on the Break.
1827080	1827520	That was it.
1827961	1832163	Which I actually, for some reason, by the sound of it, made me think it was some kind of boardwalk place.
1832203	1834905	I have no idea why I thought that, because it's not even near an ocean at all.
1835386	1840789	But it was interesting because there was this street fair going on the day we went.
1840930	1847034	And it was so random, because the girl I was with, my friend Amanda and I, had no idea where we were going.
1847074	1848475	We were just walking around trying to find this place.
1848875	1854937	and suddenly here I am, thousands of miles away on a Sunday in the middle of some street fair in little town America.
1855317	1856178	This is really odd.
1856478	1857098	Surreal for me.
1857858	1860199	But then we found the place and we went in and I was actually surprised.
1860219	1862060	There was quite a lot of Bomani at this place.
1862200	1869822	Not only had they the groove, but they had a 2DX machine and a Parapara machine and DDR and just a lot of stuff.
1870082	1871663	So I was pretty impressed.
1871683	1873644	I was kind of surprised they had all that.
1873924	1877605	Granted, not all the machines were in tip-top shape, but you know, hey.
1878186	1883828	It actually ran on quarters, which always impresses me, because I don't like tokens that much, because I always leave with extra tokens.
1884108	1886389	And the machines actually took quarters, so that was good.
1886949	1888829	And there seemed to be some okay crowds.
1888869	1890590	I didn't really talk to too many people.
1890670	1891870	I was kind of just a loner.
1892731	1893251	But that's alright.
1893271	1895412	I wasn't there to make a show.
1896432	1898032	I just kind of went in, played a few games, and left.
1898273	1900173	And that was my weekend, pretty much.
1900533	1904434	And I've just kind of spent my time here since I got back home, just trying to catch up.
1904475	1905675	Because when you leave town for two weeks...
1906275	1907096	It's really hard to catch up.
1907377	1909419	I have to go back to work tomorrow, though.
1909459	1910280	It sucks.
1911101	1916087	Anyway, that's pretty much it for me for How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day?
1917529	1923937	Anything else anybody wants to add?
1924337	1925559	I watched Rad today.
1926286	1933690	And might I add, I've, like, I only remembered, like, one scene of that movie, and that's what got me the bite, is where the guy was riding on the fence.
1934150	1936871	And I actually watched the movie today, and that was for, like, half a second.
1937511	1943574	So, but for some reason in my mind that stood out, that and the backflip in the, um, hell, hell race.
1943654	1948957	But, my God, that movie is so cheesy and awesome, and just, it's awesome.
1949397	1952379	It's just pure 80s goodness, and I watched the whole thing.
1952619	1953119	Made me happy.
1955240	1955480	Go ahead.
1956664	1960066	I last saw that movie in, huh?
1961527	1962387	Yes, I would like to.
1963048	1968531	I last saw that in Albany, Georgia when I was 10, I think.
1969892	1973554	That's the last time I've seen that movie and it's very scary that I remember where I was.
1975735	1977276	I need to see Monster Squad 2.
1978477	1980838	I was at my Uncle Wayne's house.
1982375	1998356	with my cousins and we were watching this movie and then it was over and we watched it again because at the time that was like our favorite movie and my cousin had one of those stunt bikes and was in his backyard trying to do all the stunts and everything it was kind of kind of cool
2000579	2004721	I got asked a question in the chatroom, www.orangelandrea.com, click on chat.
2004821	2011324	Sid wanted to know how Jay and Silent Bob's Secret Stash was, because I completely forgot to mention that was one other thing we did while we were in Jersey.
2011384	2015986	We went to Red Bank, New Jersey to go to Jay and Silent Bob's Secret Stash, which was very cool.
2016306	2022129	It was just your typical kind of comic book store, but it had a lot of memorabilia from the movies, which I thought was really cool.
2022449	2024049	I actually bought Loki's birthday present there.
2024069	2025090	I bought him a comic book.
2025570	2027631	And I got him a shirt.
2027971	2029191	And the shirt says shit on it.
2029451	2030271	So that's kind of cool.
2030811	2033212	And then I picked up some stickers and stuff too.
2033252	2035212	Like I got Jamie a Bear is Driving sticker.
2035272	2035772	So that's cool.
2036412	2038393	And I picked myself up a sticker.
2038533	2039413	And I got a poster.
2039513	2040333	A brand new poster.
2040373	2042314	Which we're going to hang up at some point tonight.
2042894	2044774	It'll be on the wall that you can see on the camera.
2045074	2047295	I got a new poster from Jay and Silent Bob's Secret Stash.
2047595	2051216	And it's the one where Jay and Silent Bob has a whole little monologue on it.
2051256	2053076	Where Jay and Silent Bob are talking on the...
2053696	2055998	Ain't It Cool News style site.
2056479	2059402	And they're talking about the movie and they say, you are the ones who are the ball lickers.
2059442	2060623	I have the posters.
2060683	2061083	That's cool.
2061544	2062685	So it was good times.
2062825	2064467	It was kind of a fun little place to go.
2064607	2065608	So, hooray.
2069037	2080646	Oh, and Jason says I'm a mean man because at the Phoenix airport on the way home I actually stopped and got to see Jason, our webmaster, for like 10 minutes because I had a layover in Phoenix for like 30 minutes or so.
2081007	2082388	So I got to say hi to our webmaster.
2082408	2085530	And that was very nice of him to come out and see me on his break from work.
2085610	2086511	So thank you, Jason.
2087232	2089794	And your airport rocks.
2089874	2092235	The Phoenix airport is the best place to have a layover.
2092576	2092796	Oh, good.
2092816	2093036	Thank you.
2093056	2094898	The shirt was on the webcam a couple of pictures ago.
2095078	2095338	Thank you.
2096491	2096811	All right.
2097872	2098152	Okay.
2099292	2102833	I guess we're going to go to a break, and then we're going to come back, and we want to definitely talk about DDR Extreme.
2102853	2104374	A whole lot we want to say about that.
2104414	2105434	We'll get your thoughts, too.
2105895	2110796	On the Skype line, if you want to know how the Skype line works, you can actually talk to us, just like a phone call, but free.
2111757	2113217	www.orangelaunchradio.com.
2113257	2116058	Click on Interact With Us, and all the information is there.
2116599	2116779	Yes.
2117339	2117479	What?
2117679	2117879	What?
2117999	2118139	What?
2118259	2118399	What?
2118519	2118659	What?
2118699	2118839	What?
2118899	2119019	What?
2119039	2119160	What?
2119320	2119440	What?
2120640	2120820	What?
2120900	2121240	What?
2121720	2122401	I missed you.
2123201	2123801	Aw, thank you.
2124301	2125602	Yeah, how was the show last week, Loki?
2127634	2129274	It was, uh, interesting.
2130595	2132215	It was pretty bad.
2132875	2140976	We played a lot of music, and I played a lot more music from, um, the Bomani-style remix contest, which was supposed to be judging, like, three weeks ago.
2141677	2142317	And this isn't.
2142437	2143417	I don't know what's going on.
2143857	2145537	And then, um, what else did we do?
2145817	2148158	Oh, we tried a new game that failed horribly.
2148598	2152218	And then, um... Um... I don't know.
2152278	2153379	Some other shit happened.
2153439	2153619	It was...
2156536	2159738	I know we played the Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen CD and that was sad.
2162039	2163879	Okay, there's your summary of episode 112.
2164680	2169702	Anyway, also, we definitely want to talk about this, the Akira Yamaoka contest.
2170342	2174164	We have an announcement we want to make about the Akira Yamaoka contest, and we'll do that when we get back from this break.
2174624	2175665	And for those of you that haven't heard yet...
2176345	2179327	We're giving away two signed Akira Yamaoka CDs.
2179687	2179988	Awesome.
2180548	2182409	And we have the details when we come back from this break.
2182469	2187453	In this break, Konami original music that's brand new in DDR EX USA.
2187513	2189294	We're going to start it off with Maximizer.
2189314	2192256	A lot of you guys haven't even heard that yet, I don't think, so we're going to play that for you guys.
2192777	2198121	Funk Boogie, we'll get in there too, and of course, You're Not Here, because Jamie insists that I play You're Not Here.
2198361	2198921	Jamie demands it.
2199181	2201963	So here it is, Maximizer on Orange Lounge Radio.
2201983	2202684	Enjoy, we'll be back.

2508054	2509657	Crap-free Bavani Radio.
2511259	2512001	We are back.
2512915	2521260	Not only crap free, but playing probably the only internet radio station on the planet to be playing Maximizer and all that fun stuff at this time.
2521680	2523481	So, hope you enjoyed that.
2523641	2527583	And it looks like some of you guys maybe missed that, so we'll have to play that after the show is over.
2528323	2529764	Definitely for you guys.
2529884	2534847	So, of course, Maximizer being from DDR Extreme USA, which was the big news this week.
2535327	2539950	Some very interesting opinions on that game, just kind of all across the spectrum.
2540010	2541891	People love it, people hate it.
2542723	2547784	We'll open it up for some of your opinions as well, but first, what we think of DDR Extreme USA.
2547864	2554046	So, I know some of us have played it a lot, some of us have barely seen it at all, but kind of, what did you guys think of it?
2554326	2557727	I'll start off with Loki, he had the most exposure to the game, I'm kind of curious.
2558127	2558907	What did you think of it, Loki?
2560568	2565309	They had, okay, um, decent songs, um...
2566431	2568832	The only thing I hate is unlocking old shit.
2569012	2571193	I honestly hate unlocking old shit.
2571213	2572934	It's like, ooh, Trip Machine!
2573294	2574715	I've never played that one!
2575215	2576816	You know, it's just stuff like that.
2577256	2582098	But the things that really lacked in this game, the enosisms, they were just not funny.
2582318	2584199	In fact, some songs just did not have them.
2585079	2585719	Very sad.
2586260	2589101	And the Karaoke Revolution cover songs...
2589679	2592220	Bizarre Love Triangle, that was the only one I liked.
2592420	2593360	The rest sucked.
2593760	2596361	The singing was just awful and just crap.
2596481	2598221	And the steps weren't, eh, they're okay.
2598782	2601822	The new Konami Originals, Funk Boogie, pretty cool.
2602123	2607104	Maximizer, not exactly what I was imagining, but eh, it's okay.
2607724	2610365	It's like, I don't know how to describe it.
2610665	2612105	It's annoying, but addicting.
2612706	2614546	Or like, you know, I don't know.
2614826	2617687	It's just, I hate that type of music, but it's a pretty cool song.
2618306	2618686	or something.
2619307	2627891	And then, um, you know, the two transplants, uh, Your Rage, I, um, or Your Rain, the Rage mix, I don't like that song anymore.
2628431	2629071	It's just annoying.
2629631	2632513	And, uh, and You're Not Here, that's a pretty cool song.
2632773	2633713	The steps so suck.
2633733	2634374	They're all up.
2635174	2636054	It's just all up.
2636995	2645799	And then, um, now the best thing going for it, and I really don't understand why I didn't have this, um, to start off with, why the fuck do you have to unlock mission mode?
2646320	2652242	My god, it was the coolest part of the game, and you have to unlock it, like, after a very long time to finally get mission mode.
2653142	2656363	And that was really stupid, because that's the best part of the game right there.
2656763	2658463	Then, okay, let's talk about the eye toy.
2659123	2661324	The eye toy games are, eh, they're okay.
2661524	2666706	The things that I don't like, okay, the hands and feet mode, actually, if you have a well-lit room, it works pretty well.
2667066	2668426	The problem is, it's not hard.
2668946	2669666	It's just stupid.
2669826	2671087	It's easy and stupid.
2672007	2672127	And...
2672808	2678451	What they really could have used in this game is edit mode and where you can make your own hands and feet steps.
2678952	2679852	That would fucking rock.
2680072	2682574	Because you can do some crazy shit there and it would be a lot more fun.
2684195	2689198	Then the other thing, some of the other games like the Coconut Panic, that was kind of dumb.
2689618	2690759	Amusing, but dumb.
2691451	2693993	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2717438	2725241	And the other modes that they've got, I didn't really play any of the non-iToy party modes, but they're okay from what I've seen.
2725281	2727901	They're just kind of, I think it'd be more fun if you were drunk.
2728702	2732703	And other than that, Mission Mode, I had a lot going for it.
2732723	2734484	There's a lot of good stuff in Mission Mode.
2734524	2735624	I wish it was longer.
2737404	2740686	I wish some of the songs, they had some newer songs.
2741366	2743586	The character unlocks, I really don't care anymore.
2743747	2745087	It's just kind of stupid.
2746525	2747785	That's pretty much it.
2747886	2748586	It was okay.
2749126	2754488	Mission mode will be the only thing that keeps my attention with this game.
2754548	2755208	That's the only thing.
2755608	2756028	Mission mode.
2756068	2759049	Because it's actually the only thing that's challenging in this game.
2759810	2760190	That's it.
2762831	2763891	Okay, I'm going to give you my thoughts.
2764191	2766592	I like the game a lot.
2766872	2768032	I like the game so much.
2768092	2769473	It's probably my favorite...
2770855	2771895	It's up there with Ultramix.
2771955	2774737	I'd say this and Ultramix are kind of like my two favorite home mixes right now.
2775618	2777699	Honestly, I think it's very cool.
2778139	2780200	I really like some of the new stuff they put in it.
2780761	2783823	I think there's two big mistakes here, though, that they made.
2784103	2786564	I have to get this off my chest.
2786644	2788386	Everybody's saying this.
2789186	2796911	Seriously, it's a game-crippling mistake that they made with the game, and that was the removal of the dance play setting, where you can't turn off the buttons on the pads.
2797922	2800065	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2817849	2827357	and considering that the whole thing is based on trying to get up there and dance and move, I realize for a lot of beginner people, they're probably not going to have that problem.
2827637	2828238	No, no, you know what?
2828298	2843490	No, I take that back because I was having some friends play it last night, some beginner friends, and they would try to be picking a song and they'd be stepping on my pad, which is a $100 red octane ignition pad, and they're fucking backing out because they're stepping on the wrong steps on the bottom.
2843510	2844991	They're trying to step off the arrows.
2845766	2851115	And, I just, it was, it's just a horrible oversight.
2851155	2856965	I mean, seriously, I know this sounds insane, but they should fucking recall the game and give us new copies.
2857025	2859249	Like, that's how bad of a mistake I seriously think this is.
2860990	2864551	Okay, in the bright side, well, okay, no, let's keep raining down the bad stuff.
2864851	2866192	What else bad did I want to say about it?
2866472	2869073	I also do not like the fact that they unlock old songs.
2869513	2874555	I really just hate the repeat songs, and you shouldn't unlock old stuff.
2874695	2876256	I think that's really bothersome.
2876756	2879877	But it would be cool, like, if, say...
2880919	2885861	They had an included dropout in every fucking game since in the US mixes, pretty much.
2886301	2894304	If they had, like, I don't know, like a song, like, say, for instance, I'm in DDR 10th Mix or whatever it is, and look, there's a song from First Mix.
2894604	2896905	Wow, I haven't played that since First Mix.
2896945	2898166	That was a long time ago.
2898506	2901427	That's pretty cool that they're unlocking old stuff for me to play.
2902107	2904108	That's the only situation where that'd be good.
2904408	2905728	Not, oh, look at that.
2905829	2907949	That was just in that other game I bought.
2908650	2909450	Yay.
2910664	2911084	No.
2911665	2911905	Sorry.
2913826	2916328	Anyway, here's the other mistake I think they made.
2916368	2921772	And this may be kind of... This may be kind of a little bit controversial.
2921812	2922112	I don't know.
2922672	2926695	But I think the other mistake that they made with this game was calling it DDR Extreme.
2927196	2936202	Because I seriously think that's why you've got so many people that have their expectations on one level when the product that Konami was trying to deliver was something...
2937014	2937554	and many more.
2963675	2965876	Beginner stuff, getting some friends into it, and it was fun.
2965936	2966976	I mean, that's what it's all about.
2967476	2971877	Those modes weren't for hardcore players to be challenged, I don't think.
2971918	2974658	They're just stupid fun stuff, and I think it succeeded.
2974838	2976099	I really like the eye toy stuff.
2976239	2977479	I don't have a problem with it at all.
2977799	2979040	I kind of hope they keep it going.
2979120	2982701	I would like to see hands and feet mode get a little more challenging in the next mid.
2983041	2984461	I think that's something they could expand on.
2984961	2990143	Another thing that they didn't include that really needs to be included, sensitivity settings and adjustments for the eye toy.
2990423	2993444	How the fuck, if I'm in a dim room, I can't set it to dim room mode
2993891	2999895	You know, like you can with iToyPlay or iToyGroove, they don't have any options to set the iToy stuff.
3000015	3002376	So you can't calibrate it to make it look nice.
3002937	3004878	So you're fucked if you're in a dark room.
3004998	3007840	You can't set it to be more sensitive.
3008420	3009341	Or non-sensitive.
3009521	3010902	If it's too sensitive, then you're fucked.
3011342	3013043	So that's the other thing that really sucked.
3015231	3022575	I think they should have just, honestly, knowing what we know now about the next Japanese release and seeing as pretty much Konami of Japan made most of this release anyway.
3022595	3025197	You can't really blame the US for what's going on on this release.
3026417	3030279	The dance play setting thing, I'm almost positive it's Konami of Japan's fault.
3030319	3031140	We all know the story.
3033231	3038997	We all know the story about the Marvelous Thing and how that was fought by Konami of America to Konami of Japan.
3039217	3041640	And Konami of Japan said, no, they're not changing the Marvelous Thing.
3041940	3045804	And I would bet money the exact same thing happened with the dance play setting.
3046825	3049448	Shame on you, Konami of Japan, for being lazy with that.
3049848	3052711	You really upset a lot of us with that, so shame on you for that.
3052751	3053532	There's no way...
3054341	3057427	I really want to purchase DDR Festival knowing that.
3057507	3061755	And especially because, you know, what we'll talk about later, but Festival doesn't really have that great a song list so far.
3062055	3065581	But if that dance play setting isn't going to be in Festival, there's no reason I need to buy it, honestly.
3065621	3066303	There's zero.
3067325	3067505	But...
3070546	3076930	I guess really knowing what we know now about DDR Festival, the next Japanese release, they probably should have just called this mix DDR Festival.
3077511	3079672	The US one, they should have just called this mix DDR Festival.
3079712	3085016	And then people wouldn't have gone in with all these expectations like, Oh, Cartoon Heroes has to be in it, and Sakura has to be in it.
3085036	3085696	No, no, no, no, no.
3086016	3090379	Because honestly, Konami was doing something different with this mix, and I think it was cool.
3090860	3093442	I, for one, like the new interface.
3093742	3094242	A lot.
3094722	3095323	And it's not...
3096013	3100595	The circle thing that was bugging everybody, that people were talking about, like, oh, it looks like third mix and stuff.
3100615	3102096	That's not what I'm talking about, really.
3102496	3110900	That's just one part of it, but really, the rest of the music in the game, and the way it looks in-game when you're actually playing the game is amazing.
3111260	3113441	It's way better than, like, any other DDR game.
3113501	3114141	It looks in-game.
3114181	3119723	It takes everything that's great about fourth mix, everything that's great about max, the 60 frames per second and stuff, and combines it.
3120624	3125486	I think the interface is the best one they've had yet, with the Oni battery bar and everything looks great.
3126232	3126732	So what?
3126813	3128154	The wheel looks a little different.
3128354	3129435	It doesn't really bother me at all.
3129535	3131596	I like the wheel better than... You see it for like two seconds.
3131817	3140644	I like the wheel better than the other way, because you... I don't know, it just... Having started with Second Mix, I think that it makes me think a lot more of the older ones, so I like it better.
3143646	3143806	So...
3146078	3149660	Yeah, the little records would have been cool, but, you know, I don't really care.
3149940	3151400	The interface really doesn't bother me.
3151440	3153181	It's not something that, like, ruined the game for me.
3153201	3154302	It didn't really faze me at all.
3154342	3155822	I kind of thought, oh, that's different.
3156142	3170789	But I can see where people who have been kind of stuck on DDR Extreme for several years now, who have really badly, because they can't afford a Japanese PlayStation 2, have wanted something like that for a console for a long time, are a little bit disappointed.
3171880	3173101	You know what?
3173261	3174821	It's a new song.
3175402	3176882	I know, I know, I know.
3178223	3195509	Honestly, from that standpoint, if Konami knows damn well there's not going to be any new arcade mixes, which from Konami Japan, it doesn't sound like they're ever planning on really doing one, it would have not been smart to release just a port of DDR Extreme, because then why would you go to the arcades?
3196294	3216868	so I think them making it a lot different was probably smart on their end in the end because you'll still go to the arcades to play Sakura and all that stuff so I don't know just kind of my thought I know but come on come on they know damn well it's here they know damn well extreme is here
3218034	3235510	Haven't we had this talk on the show with somebody from Konami here, and they said that they know it's just one of those things where it's like, and I always said this, nobody has confirmed this, but this has always been my opinion on this, is that it has to do with the music licensing, and that it's way easier to get the music license in Japan.
3236010	3244758	So if they put that disclaimer on there that says, don't use this outside Japan, and then, oh, well, gee, imagine that, the machines ended up in the U.S., gee, fancy that, how did that happen?
3245380	3250563	They don't have to go and get sued by the record companies because they have the disclaimer on there.
3250583	3251624	It's the arcade owner's fault.
3251664	3253065	The game's in there when it's not supposed to be.
3253405	3255926	But at the same time, they got all the great music for DDR.
3256026	3257607	I don't know.
3258048	3258648	That's just my thought.
3258668	3264071	I know you didn't get to play it a whole lot, Jamie, but what did you think of Extreme?
3264091	3264832	Just kind of looking at it.
3264852	3265272	It's okay.
3265312	3268154	I like the non-stop music when you're picking the non-stop.
3269394	3270455	That music was just pretty cool.
3272656	3273697	Yeah, the mini-music was really good.
3275111	3278154	I like the new mods that they're doing in this mission mode.
3278354	3279175	Those are really cool.
3280596	3283479	And also Air Japan's going to hack those out and put those in the normal game.
3284179	3285160	But feeding time?
3285921	3287643	Feeding time scared me.
3289164	3290105	So stupid.
3292627	3294549	Angel, I know you got to play a lot of Extreme this week.
3294569	3295129	What were your thoughts?
3295149	3299013	I'm going to open up the Skype line soon for your thoughts, but I want to get everybody in the studio first.
3300204	3306168	Um, well, I didn't get to play too much of it, considering I'd just gotten it... What day was it, release Tuesday?
3306649	3307129	Yeah, anyway.
3307790	3314334	Um, the thing that kind of got me down was, um, Unlocking Your Rain, like, the second song I played.
3314374	3315355	I'm like, no!
3315915	3318057	I wish that it was, you know, like, the last song.
3318617	3322920	Just because, like, that was the song I was really looking forward to, but... Isn't Your Rain in there by default?
3323040	3324501	Did you just miss it the first game, maybe?
3324701	3325702	I thought it was in there by default.
3326022	3327183	I might have, um...
3328487	3329387	But, I don't know.
3330608	3330968	I don't know.
3331888	3334589	I just... Oh, okay.
3334669	3336610	Well, anyway.
3337030	3338670	Yeah, that was kind of a downer.
3338730	3346633	I know there's other stuff that I probably have yet to unlock, like the BT song and the, oh, whatever, all the other songs that we've been playing today.
3347473	3348193	But, you know what?
3348333	3349554	That's for the week to come.
3352085	3360511	And how many games, how many games will it take before you make more steps for Max 2 Oni songs?
3362593	3364274	Or the Max 1 Oni songs, whatever song.
3364955	3367336	You know, Max 2 Oni songs, come on now.
3367516	3370519	I mean, Zegaru Apple Mix, it's been out forever now.
3370659	3372120	Make some new fucking steps.
3372380	3373441	It doesn't take that long.
3373841	3375342	Seriously, just make new steps.
3375703	3376223	Complete them.
3376755	3382878	They did it in the UK, you know, before the beatmix in Historia 2001.
3383138	3385259	They did it there because they like to be complete.
3385599	3387740	But no, you know, we just have to be lazy.
3388180	3392062	We're only going to have challenge steps because we don't want to make new steps.
3392502	3393123	Yeah.
3393923	3395404	So get off your ass and make new steps.
3398985	3402687	Anyway, I think this mix will hold me over just fine until Ultramix 2 comes out.
3403663	3404103	But you know what?
3404143	3409145	Seriously, the bar of expectations is just so high with Ultramix 2 right now with everything I've heard about it.
3409465	3415328	It's just kind of like I'm almost going to feel bad when it comes out because it's probably not going to... I don't know.
3415448	3415808	I don't know.
3416408	3420750	My bar is so high for Ultramix 2 that that is really the one I'm waiting for at this point.
3421050	3422210	I mean, Extreme's cool and all, though.
3422230	3422790	Don't get me wrong.
3423291	3427212	I do recommend if you are a DDR fan and you have a PlayStation 2, you should have this game.
3428073	3428893	You should have this game.
3429233	3431854	If you have a Japanese PlayStation 2, then I guess you have a choice.
3432267	3435669	But if you have a US one, then you really should just get this game.
3436009	3438271	I mean, it's DDR and it's good.
3441052	3441172	Oh.
3442193	3442393	Yeah.
3446355	3447096	Anyway.
3447216	3447476	Okay.
3448897	3449217	I don't know.
3450158	3451158	I'll play more this week.
3451799	3453800	And, you know, unlock more crap.
3454780	3455681	And maybe I'll like it more.
3455781	3458442	But right now, as soon as I saw you ran, I was like, no!
3459543	3461024	Big disappointment for me, but I'll keep playing.
3462139	3463479	Shane, don't hit me, please.
3464920	3466400	Bradley, you're a DDR fan.
3466420	3468921	You mentioned at the beginning of the show you were a little bit disappointed with the mix.
3468941	3470022	Just kind of curious on your thoughts.
3470242	3473723	Well, based on what I saw, I wasn't that impressed with it.
3474543	3475203	It wasn't bad.
3475283	3476404	It was just, nah.
3476544	3479425	It didn't make me excited or anything.
3479725	3487467	But I probably would, if I got to see Master Mode, or might have had, or whatever that is called.
3487527	3488968	Because we didn't unlock that while I was here.
3489188	3489988	Oh, the Maximizer?
3490008	3490088	Yeah.
3490683	3492724	No, not Maximizer, the Master Mode.
3493325	3494105	Oh, Mission Mode.
3494125	3494545	Oh, Mission Mode.
3494565	3494946	Yeah.
3494966	3495766	Yeah.
3496246	3500289	Because I like to do those kind of weird things in owning modes and things like that.
3502310	3504911	Instead of just straight up DDR when I'm playing with the home mixes.
3505272	3506813	You know, that kind of reminds... I don't have them anymore.
3506833	3507673	That reminded me of something.
3507713	3514617	A lot of people were really upset because there were no 10-foot steps for Maximizer because supposedly Maximizer is supposed to be this new... Well, okay, whatever.
3514657	3515558	They have the Mission Mode thing.
3515578	3516458	But you know what I'm talking about.
3516618	3518039	They don't have steps in-game.
3518540	3519200	I'm kind of like...
3519975	3529917	Big deal, because for me, honestly, I don't get the desire to have all these insane 10-footers on home, because how in the hell are you going to pass that stuff on a home pad?
3529957	3538858	I mean, I realize people do it, but I've been playing DDR for years, and there's no way in hell I'd be passing half those 10-footers on a home pad.
3538898	3539939	It's like, you just can't do it.
3540279	3541619	It's not the same as the arcade.
3541659	3546460	I mean, granted, you may have a metal stage or whatever, but if that's the case, you are in the minority.
3546800	3547980	Let's face it, you are not
3548655	3559544	The majority of, uh, you know, the people that are gonna be picking up DDR, you are the minority, and if, you know, Konami's gonna cater to you, you're, like, extra special if you get your ten-footer, so, you know, whatever.
3559644	3568250	I just, I just don't see the point in bitching about there not being a lot of new ten-footers, because, especially with the dance play setting not being fucked up.
3568350	3570232	How, now how are you gonna pass ten-footers?
3570592	3572393	Now the dance play setting's there, it's like, ugh.
3573134	3576717	Unless you're playing Button Button Revolution, but that's not what DDR's supposed to be for!
3577403	3579805	Then they wouldn't be getting their weight loss news stories and stuff.
3579865	3580565	Anyway, I'm done.
3580645	3580925	I'm done.
3583707	3584127	Anything else?
3584247	3584588	Anybody else?
3584648	3587209	Okay.
3587269	3590452	Let's go to a break, and then I'm going to open up the Skype line, and we'll get your thoughts.
3590972	3595175	And speaking of DDR in the news, we want to get to that story, because DDR was in the news again this week.
3595775	3597256	So, of course, you know we've got to mention that.
3597776	3602820	This break, we're going to do some of those Karaoke Revolution songs, because there's surprisingly some decent ones.
3603440	3606422	I will not be playing Waiting for Tonight, though, because I fucking hate that one.
3607588	3610650	But we will play Bizarre Love Triangle and some other stuff.
3610790	3611090	Enjoy.
3611130	3611630	We'll be back.
3611830	3615412	And with the Skype line, open up your thoughts on DDR Extreme.
3615472	3619514	And if you want to argue with us on some point, go for it.
3684101	3690602	I love you, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3743118	3755565	Oh, yes, this lady's a knife, and the feeling's right Oh, yes, this lady's a knife, oh, what a knife Oh, baby, oh, baby Oh, baby, oh, baby Oh, baby, oh, baby Oh, baby, oh, baby
3782910	3807370	Oh yes, it's late at night, and I'm feeling light Oh yes, it's late at night, oh what a night Oh yes, it's late at night, and I'm feeling bright Oh yes, it's late at night, oh what a night Oh yes, it's late at night, and I'm feeling light Oh yes, it's late at night, oh what a night Oh yes, it's late at night, and I'm feeling bright Oh yes, it's late at night
3838195	3857941	There's no talking to you It's so sad that you're leaving It takes time to believe it But after all that's said and done You're gonna be the lonely one Oh, you'll be leaving like
3883655	3885981	Thanks for watching!
3918780	3929448	For up to the minute Pomanian gaming news, discussion forums, and for access to the chatroom, visit our website at orangeloungeradio.com We're back.
3930509	3935953	I forgot to even talk about the Karaoke Revolution songs in DDR Extreme, but playing those kind of reminded me of some of the reaction from the chatroom.
3937654	3939976	Karaoke Revolution songs, I thought I was going to love it.
3940356	3941597	I thought it was going to be a great idea.
3943912	3947302	But to be honest, I'm not a big fan of any of the Karaoke Revolution transplants.
3947322	3950332	I mean, maybe a couple are okay, but at the same time...
3950934	3962361	I kind of applaud Konami for trying that because it was a pretty clever idea to get some big dance songs in DDR without having to pay such a high license fee is to put in the covers.
3962921	3964882	It's just that the covers aren't that hot.
3965223	3969745	But I think it's a neat idea and maybe they'll do it better next time.
3969865	3972187	I don't know, but I can't say I'm a huge fan of any of those songs.
3972207	3972947	That's me personally.
3973047	3975168	I'm not really a huge fan of any of those.
3979309	3981110	You don't think the original Bizarre Love Triangle is good?
3982250	3984251	No, the original Bizarre Love Triangle was excellent.
3984291	3985492	I'm talking about the Cher song.
3985792	3986932	Oh, okay.
3986952	3988653	Women's career was over a long time ago.
3989633	3989973	Gotcha.
3990253	3990534	All right.
3993575	4001478	I forgot to bring up the... I'm glad the microphone didn't pick that up, Loki.
4001498	4001618	Okay.
4002555	4007240	I'm not even gonna... I said, why can't she ski into a tree?
4007300	4011023	If she had skied into the tree, she would have bounced off from all the plastic in her face.
4011164	4018651	Anyway... On a different note, I want to talk about the Akira Yamaoka CD contest.
4019227	4019808	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4048949	4053092	After the show tonight, at some point, probably check for it tomorrow on our website, OrangeLandRadio.com.
4053493	4056255	We will be starting the contest next Monday.
4056295	4059577	You're going to have to listen Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday night.
4059617	4068383	If you can't listen, get your friend to listen because we've got to be giving out some trivia questions that you're going to have to answer to correctly be put in the drawing to win one of those CDs.
4068423	4069044	You don't want to miss it.
4070012	4071934	So we're going to be starting that next Monday.
4072254	4077659	And of course a big thank you to one of our partner sites, DDRspot.com for helping us out with this contest.
4077739	4079601	And they're going to be giving away some CDs too.
4079901	4082323	So if you don't win with us, go try and win with them.
4082343	4083945	Because they're going to be doing their own contest.
4083985	4085106	I don't know what they're doing yet though.
4085126	4086087	They haven't even clued me in.
4086387	4086907	But that's alright.
4087688	4089089	So definitely check them out.
4089189	4090811	And they're going to be relaunching their site.
4091371	4092712	I don't want to give too much away though.
4092893	4093793	I think I already said too much.
4094949	4102813	Alright, as promised, let's open up the Skype line and see what your thoughts are on DDR Extreme USA.
4106014	4109936	Of course, I gotta wait, because there's the delay, so I probably should open it up a little sooner, but that's alright.
4114031	4115232	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4145978	4149060	Alright, what are your thoughts, buddy, on DDR Extreme USA?
4149740	4154023	Oh, DDR Extreme, so many complaints, so many complaints.
4154603	4158946	I still haven't played the game where all these complaints are directed towards, because I played a very decent game.
4161467	4164689	So you must have been playing some completely different game than everybody else, huh?
4165390	4165890	Pretty much.
4165910	4168491	I mean, I fully enjoyed the song list.
4169031	4174813	I mean, there are a few that I didn't like, but, I mean, out of 70 songs, you're going to have a few that you don't like.
4174913	4175674	I agree, I agree.
4175694	4180855	There's going to be that let them move, or in the case of DDR Max 2, Forever Sunshine.
4181016	4181576	Sorry, Sigurd.
4182236	4183016	Oh, please.
4183096	4184537	Forever Sunshine was good.
4184937	4186317	Oh, please, yourself.
4186718	4187898	Alright, alright, to each his own.
4188453	4189234	Use their own.
4189414	4190274	Agree to disagree.
4190555	4194978	Let's just these one-line complaints saying, oh my god, I hate this game, go get Japanese Extreme.
4194998	4195378	What's the point?
4195398	4201723	So basically people saying this mix isn't Japanese enough.
4213070	4214351	It's not Japanese enough.
4214551	4215732	Ironic.
4216372	4220094	Ironic, considering this game was pretty much made by Konami of Japan.
4220535	4221335	We've pretty much found out.
4221355	4224777	If you don't think it's Japanese enough, just play the stupid feeding frenzy mode.
4226621	4230022	The last four American mixes you own DDR Festivals?
4250652	4251353	Pretty much.
4251433	4252514	I mean, of course, we don't know.
4252794	4257398	Now, there could be something unlocked, or there might be some cool features they haven't talked about yet, but... 22 Dunk.
4257598	4259039	I'm betting on 22 Dunk.
4259199	4261701	Assumably, it's all the same.
4262742	4267906	It's gonna be totally like Max 1, the Japanese one, with the whole two unlocks.
4268347	4268847	Woo!
4268927	4269788	Two unlocks!
4269928	4270669	Oh my god!
4270889	4272130	There's gotta be more, right?
4272270	4273911	If I play like 500 times, there'll be more?
4273931	4274452	Nope.
4274532	4274732	Nope.
4276894	4278715	Or was that Max 2 with 3 unlocks?
4278995	4280216	Oh my god, will there be 4?
4280496	4282057	Oh wait, no, I thought it was Party Collection.
4282458	4286640	I'm gonna guess that there's gonna be 5 unlocks in this next game.
4286660	4287201	5 unlocks.
4287581	4287961	Brand new.
4289542	4290063	So noted.
4290323	4293545	What was your favorite thing about Extreme USA, Mr. Mullet?
4293565	4294185	My favorite thing?
4294546	4295726	Easily the mission mode.
4296167	4305032	I mean, I didn't think there was gonna be that many missions, and I didn't get a chance to play the game until Thursday, so I had to wade through about a billion complaints on the Freak Forums.
4305273	4305793	Ha ha ha.
4306468	4312111	But as soon as I heard someone say something about Mission 75 I was like, hold on, back up the car, 75?
4312611	4323477	Yeah, I know, there's a lot of missions in there I think even here in studio we're only through like Mission 53 We just haven't had enough time to play through all the missions Have you checked out Mission 38 yet?
4323937	4332141	That was the one with Absolute It was Absolute and it was all these different speeds Oh, that was fun
4333154	4336755	But then again, wait till you get, there's one in the second half with Firefly Heavy.
4337255	4337795	Same deal.
4338496	4339156	Oh, jeez.
4339176	4354700	Speeds up, slows down, and apparently near the very end, like 98 or 99, there's the official fucked up Frozen Ray mission where it's reverse scroll, dark, arrows mixed up with random speed changes.
4354920	4355921	Oh my gosh.
4356401	4357761	What mission number is that?
4358241	4358881	It's either 98 or 90.
4358941	4359782	It's in the last five.
4359802	4360682	Oh my god.
4362697	4366798	I did the one, there was a Frozen Ray one, and I had to turn the controller upside down to do it.
4367219	4369540	I think it was on, it was like 49 or something.
4369920	4370720	Mission 50.
4371761	4372001	Mission 50.
4373802	4383006	It took me over 50 tries for that one, and I did it with my pad right side up, and I managed to, I had to memorize the first part without looking at the screen.
4383026	4385727	I could do this mission now without looking at the screen.
4387325	4397574	I'll tell you, the one that stuck me for the longest time, and I can't believe this one took me as long as it did, but it's Your Rain on .5 and Dark.
4398234	4400917	And I swear to God, we had to do it like 40 times to beat it.
4401437	4402598	That didn't take me that long.
4402858	4407502	Did we ever get the one done where you have to, it was kick the can, where you had to get 20 of each?
4408123	4409064	20 goods, 20 greats, 20 perfects?
4409084	4409124	No.
4411158	4412358	We're still stuck on that one.
4412398	4414019	That's like in the easy bunch.
4414099	4414879	We're still stuck on it.
4414919	4415539	We can't do it.
4415619	4417520	I mean, it's too hard to get goods for us.
4417620	4420781	Oh, yeah, like, oh, the 20 great, good, perfect ones.
4421361	4422521	I managed to pass that.
4422921	4423821	It took me a while, too.
4424862	4430503	But, I mean, there's like some of them that were apparently very hard and that I couldn't pass.
4431844	4432884	Or, like, I could pass.
4433064	4434224	That was, like, really surprising.
4434244	4436325	There's apparently some easy ones that took me forever.
4436585	4439246	I guess it all depends on what you can do and what you can't.
4440286	4440466	Hmm.
4441178	4450306	Why don't you plug your site again, because you have this really nifty column over on that site, and people should go look at it.
4466138	4469601	Oh yes, www.insidepulse.com.
4469841	4477647	Expect a DDR Extreme review that actually praises the game for what it has rather than what it doesn't have within reason.
4478982	4484706	It's like, I don't bash the game because it doesn't have Sakura, for example.
4485087	4488869	But I will point out some of the fatal flaws, as it were.
4488950	4497836	But I mean, to be totally honest, this game has enough material in it to make this the greatest home version ever.
4497956	4500218	Until next month when we get Ultramix 2.
4500598	4501419	Or November, really.
4503300	4504461	I'm telling you, I'm telling you.
4505282	4506783	Based on the hype alone...
4507549	4508889	Ultramix 2, all the way.
4509189	4509549	But we'll see.
4509589	4509809	That's true.
4510210	4512850	Well, anyway, I'll finish my thought if you don't mind.
4512990	4513210	Sure.
4514290	4528253	Like I said, it has enough material to make this the greatest home version ever, but it has enough, it has the critical dance pad error, which really didn't affect me that much, but it has that error and it has a few other errors to bring it right back down.
4528553	4530874	But the good far outweighs the bad, really.
4530894	4531154	Really.
4531893	4533554	I agree, the good outweighs the bad.
4533814	4536675	The dance pad thing is really annoying, but I'll get over it someday.
4536735	4537576	Somehow I'll survive.
4537596	4542098	When are you going to start writing for the wrestling portion of the site?
4542118	4543018	That's what I'm curious about.
4545580	4546980	Had to ask, had to ask.
4548601	4549422	Get some wrasslin'.
4549762	4551042	Are you looking forward to Rumble Roses?
4552263	4554744	All the boys on that site must be looking forward to Rumble Roses.
4554864	4555304	Come on.
4555805	4558566	You got the Bomani artist, you got the wrasslin'.
4559383	4560985	Boobies, come on.
4562046	4565129	If I get that game, it'll be to hear Look to the Sky again.
4565489	4565870	All right.
4566290	4566751	I don't care.
4568072	4569954	Look to the Sky and Boobies, right?
4570755	4571516	Look to the Boobies.
4571636	4572837	Look to the Boobies, exactly.
4572857	4573438	That's Rumble Road.
4573458	4574639	That should be it.
4574659	4577002	You know how when they advertise things, they have that tagline?
4577202	4578543	It should be Rumble Roses.
4578863	4579504	Look to the Boobies.
4581326	4582207	Look to the Boobies.
4583333	4584933	Awesome action gameplay.
4585094	4586274	Realistic, rusty moves.
4586434	4587634	Lots of boobies!
4588834	4589334	And mud.
4589614	4590675	Don't forget the mud.
4590695	4591815	The flesh-colored mud.
4592015	4593015	Look to the boobies.
4593215	4593995	True color mix.
4594596	4594876	All right.
4595836	4596956	All right, I'm hanging up on you, Mullet.
4596976	4598116	We've got to let some other people call in.
4598316	4598576	All right, bye.
4598596	4600177	But thanks for the input, as always.
4601237	4601717	Have a good one.
4603077	4604538	Yay, it's always good to talk to you.
4604658	4607158	All right, we'll reopen the Skype line if somebody else wants to call in.
4608139	4610179	And let us know their thoughts on DDR Extreme USA.
4611394	4615837	We're going to have to kind of start shifting gears here in a little bit, though, because we definitely want to get to the cage match.
4615877	4622442	Of course, now we've got to get to our FUs, and I still want to talk about In the Groove at some point, and all that other stuff as well.
4622482	4623943	Wasn't that a Madonna song?
4625164	4626565	No, that's Into the Groove.
4627045	4629086	That's Into the Groove, not In the Groove.
4629627	4630688	In the Groove's a little different.
4633149	4634070	Yay, another caller.
4635091	4637092	Howdy, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4637152	4637593	What's up?
4638513	4639334	Yo, it's Dork.
4639654	4641035	Hey, Dork, what's going on?
4643296	4645236	I love this name.
4645737	4650619	I swear, I'm declaring that our listeners have the coolest handles on the internet.
4650879	4653440	Between like El Mullet and Dork, come on.
4653580	4655421	Hey, you guys win at the internet.
4655441	4656341	Captain Canada, yeah.
4656701	4657762	You guys win at the internet.
4658482	4659862	Hey, Dork, guess who?
4662223	4664865	Anyways, on the subject of... Oh, fine, don't guess who.
4665125	4665965	You're fired.
4665985	4667446	I'm sorry, what's up?
4667526	4668326	Angel's taking over.
4668366	4669466	What's up, Dork?
4670147	4670487	Never mind.
4670507	4670907	What's up, Dork?
4671804	4671904	Hi.
4672424	4672645	Hi.
4673725	4673945	Huh?
4674205	4674746	Repeat, please.
4674766	4675226	What's going on?
4675246	4675946	Sorry, you have to repeat.
4675966	4676547	There was chaos.
4678788	4679448	Uh, wait.
4679748	4679969	What?
4680649	4681349	Angel was talking?
4681630	4682190	Yeah, she was.
4682210	4682930	Yeah, but it's your turn.
4682970	4683310	That's alright.
4683350	4683771	It's your turn.
4683811	4684111	What's up?
4684331	4685292	No, what did she say?
4685912	4687093	She was trying to say hi.
4687753	4690194	But I think there's a delay or something and it messed everything up.
4690294	4690775	Well, what's up?
4691055	4692255	What's your thoughts on Extreme?
4693136	4696238	Well, uh, I got some good thoughts and bad thoughts.
4696278	4700460	I kind of said some good and bad on Wednesday, but eh.
4701260	4704723	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4721877	4725338	But for the most part, you have to remember, you have to satisfy everybody.
4725438	4729758	So there's always the way the song list could be improved to match our own personal tastes.
4729838	4735099	But if you change the song list to what you would like, then somebody else would hate the game.
4735459	4736099	So, you know.
4736560	4737620	But I understand, I understand.
4737680	4739140	You could always just have more songs, hey?
4740280	4743841	Maybe so, but... Let's see here.
4745641	4746001	I don't know.
4746261	4750782	I kind of figure that Oni and Nonstop are a bit too easy, don't you think?
4752169	4753049	Um, maybe.
4753090	4765535	I think some of the non-stops are a little bit too easy, but then again, everything is difficult with that dance play option being gone, so... Yeah, but then again, to negate all that, you have Mission Mode.
4766075	4766375	That's true.
4766395	4767255	Which is really awesome.
4767315	4768556	Mission Mode is very awesome.
4768936	4772077	It's one of the coolest things in DDR yet, next to online play.
4772978	4778480	Oh, by the way, the Frozen Ray on Heavy with the one on Dark, Reverse, and...
4779744	4782146	Mixed Up Arrows, that's Mission 98.
4783507	4784627	Mission 98, thank you.
4784687	4786809	We haven't gotten there yet, we're a little slow.
4787929	4788210	Yeah.
4789270	4792332	I tried that one up to like 100-something times already.
4793713	4796195	So on a scale of 1 to 5, how would you rate DDR Extreme?
4799757	4796195	2.
4799777	4800477	2?
4799997	4800477	Oh, ouch.
4801378	4804820	Alright, what would you say was your least favorite thing about the whole game?
4805240	4805760	Least favorite.
4807522	4808002	Songless.
4808561	4810743	Songlist, ouch.
4811543	4812284	Maybe next time.
4812304	4813625	Maybe next time.
4814165	4816266	Alright, we're going to let you go so we can talk to some other folks.
4817307	4818668	But thanks for the call, Dork.
4818688	4819269	We appreciate it.
4820249	4820790	Have a good one.
4832198	4835380	I can feel the evil vibe building in this room.
4835860	4836100	Why?
4836140	4837481	Thanks to Loki's device.
4837501	4840562	Oh God, Loki's trying to finish his little device over there.
4840583	4843604	The one he's been working on for the past three episodes or something.
4845185	4846766	I feel the evil is close.
4848086	4851008	I feel that Satan's going to come up and just burn up the floor.
4851288	4852348	Alright, we got another caller.
4852368	4853469	This is going to be the last one for now.
4853989	4854229	What's up?
4856337	4857117	Hey there, Dark Knight.
4857157	4858298	I'm glad to get the last call.
4858498	4859218	Hey, Dark Knight.
4859238	4861519	Well, it won't be the last call ever, but for this segment.
4861559	4864141	I mean, if we have time at the end of the show, we'll take more extreme thoughts.
4864161	4865121	It is the ultimate call.
4865761	4866442	Yes, it is.
4866522	4868182	But for now, you're the lucky one.
4870143	4870663	What's up?
4870844	4872604	What's your thoughts on DDR Extreme, Dark Knight?
4873645	4874865	It's okay.
4874885	4877266	There are some little downsides to it, though.
4877627	4877927	All right.
4877947	4878867	What are the downsides?
4879587	4881208	I agree with you with the dance play thing.
4881248	4882609	I kind of noticed that when I looked at it.
4882629	4884189	I was like, something's missing.
4884209	4885090	I'm like, uh...
4885977	4888117	Oh, I can't cut the extra arrows off.
4888237	4890678	Yeah, the dance play thing was a real bummer.
4890978	4891378	What else?
4892078	4893839	Mission Mode was okay.
4894079	4897119	I'm kind of slow because I'm still stuck on Mission 15.
4897339	4897939	It's hard!
4898759	4900680	But they do have the crazy missions on there.
4901120	4904981	One, it was like all the arrows were bunched up into one big arrow.
4905521	4906901	And you didn't know which way you had to hit it.
4907041	4908901	I haven't seen that one yet.
4909481	4912602	It's like all the arrows get bunched, jammed into one arrow.
4914022	4917285	Wow, I have to... It scrolls like one line.
4917445	4921167	Loki played like half a mission mode while I was out of town, but it's cool.
4921228	4923309	I gotta look at some of these other missions that I missed out on.
4923589	4925251	Maybe I'll just erase the file and start over.
4925931	4930034	And then it was like one mission where you have to deliberately get no goods on all freeze arrows.
4930314	4932016	I'm like, I can't do that.
4932056	4933597	My feet doesn't let me do that.
4933737	4934397	Wow.
4934658	4936179	I know I failed it like six times.
4936239	4938941	I love the one where Maximizer can't get a combo higher than four.
4940180	4946543	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4969213	4975135	And then, of course, they have the ability to go to challenge or non-stop during, like, while picking.
4975235	4978776	Instead of, like, having to pick it early, you can pick it, like, on the song rotation.
4979217	4979557	Huh.
4980577	4985079	So, like, when you're looking at it, you see, you're, like, hearing the second song, and then all of a sudden, like, I want to do a challenge step.
4985119	4987279	So you go to challenge, and you go to challenge mode.
4988100	4989660	Gotcha, gotcha, yeah.
4989700	4991301	Yes, like that one.
4993112	4996074	I guess the odd stuff, Hyper Dash is the only thing I like on it.
4996214	4998875	Anything else, I didn't even want to attempt to even try.
4999756	5001737	Just by looking, I'm like, no.
5003438	5003738	No.
5004838	5008360	All in all, I'll give the REX about at least an 8.
5009301	5009761	An 8 out of 10?
5009941	5010962	An 8 out of 10.
5011302	5011722	All right.
5011902	5012423	Sounds good.
5012443	5013883	Hey, thanks for the call, Dark Knight.
5013903	5016245	We've got to let you go because we're going to get to break, but thanks for your input.
5016485	5016925	Have a good one.
5017585	5017866	All right.
5018066	5018306	All right.
5018346	5018546	Bye.
5018976	5023420	We will take more calls a little later on during the show about DDR Extreme USA and your thoughts.
5024080	5029345	We do like hearing what our listeners have to say because, you know, they know more than we do most of the time, which is the sad truth.
5029705	5029985	All right.
5030486	5031707	We are going to go to a break, though.
5031747	5036851	When we come back, my review of In the Groove and the Cage Match when we get back.
5037391	5040774	After this, starting off with some more licensed music from DDR Extreme.
5041094	5042856	I know some folks in the chat room wanted to hear this.
5043276	5043857	So here you go.
5043917	5044958	Some music for you guys.
5045018	5045238	Enjoy.
5063215	5063756	Thanks for watching!
5103317	5104139	Thanks for watching!
5146167	5147309	Thanks for watching!
5183295	5208205	We will leave someday Your hand in my hand We will make our plans We will fight so high Tell all our friends goodbye We will be just like you This is what we'll do
5211560	5212801	Thanks for watching!
5265160	5265841	Thank you for watching!
5338567	5342450	Orange Lounge Radio, Bomani Music, and more.
5343832	5361226	We are back with Orange Lounge Radio, talking about DDR Extreme USA mostly, but you know, just by coincidence, tonight was probably going to be dominated by DDR Extreme USA chat, but I got a chance to play In The Groove this week, which is the other Bomani-ish game.
5361246	5363468	It's not really a Bomani game, but you all know the story.
5365110	5365310	You want...
5365874	5366695	Oh, okay.
5366735	5369177	Sorry, DarkSakura was barking orders at Angel.
5370318	5371579	Just kidding.
5371679	5373821	I asked very nicely, okay?
5374261	5376963	I said, would you please get me a napkin?
5376983	5377824	But you barked it a little.
5377844	5378344	No, I'm kidding.
5379105	5380146	I'll show you bark.
5381507	5382488	I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
5382888	5383148	Alright.
5385350	5388092	In the Groove's been, it's controversial.
5388433	5389093	Let's just leave it at that.
5389133	5390194	It's a controversial game.
5391255	5393517	Many folks are like, what the hell is this?
5394119	5415454	It's basically, for those that don't know, the folks that did Stepmania, which is the DDR sim, teamed up with some other folks in Seattle, I guess, I don't know what they did before, teamed up with this Rockstore Games thing, to put together a new machine for the US, I'm assuming to make up for a lack of new DDR mixes in the US, although...
5416602	5419486	I'm sure they would tell you this has nothing to do with DDR.
5419526	5424572	They just want to make a brand new music game to kind of give something for the music fans to appreciate.
5424873	5425634	So I got to play the game.
5426707	5430369	I went to 8 on the Break where they are beta testing it, I guess.
5430709	5434891	From what I understand, I actually checked one of the big websites, itgfreak.com.
5435511	5436772	Funny, itgfreak.
5438473	5443635	I checked this site out and it's apparently still a beta machine, even though the full version is out.
5443995	5445696	But it looked pretty finished to me.
5445816	5447257	It played pretty finished, I guess.
5448638	5477258	but again it's a beta so some things I saw may have been different from the final version but I think for the most part my assessment will be on track and I realize there's people that love Indigroove and I realize there's people that hate it and hate everything it stands for so that being said my review of the game is basically going to be summed up with it's not as bad as people who brag on it would make you think it is it's not that bad but
5478601	5478901	Good stuff.
5493787	5494708	Um, the mines.
5495068	5503892	I thought, now see this is one of those things that I wouldn't have known unless I played the game because I thought mines were a stupid idea to begin with until I actually got to play it and I thought it was actually really fun.
5504212	5511615	The way the step charts were done, the mines were really smartly placed, it's a neat new feature for the game, I like the mines, the mines can stay.
5512095	5516237	Um, I think as for other step mania maker folks out there,
5516806	5517427	Thank you for watching!
5537559	5551785	In the Groove scores you on this percentage system, which is basically your score out of 100% of the possible, and this is how you can tell that this game is absolutely slanted towards people that perfect attack, which, when you look at the people that work on it, doesn't surprise me much, but that's fine.
5552426	5555147	For a perfect attacker, you know, it's great.
5555187	5558748	The scoring system's pretty smart, and I like the scoring system, it's cool.
5559569	5562650	And just as I said, it takes perfect attack to the next level of
5563470	5566614	I didn't see a lot of stuff that looked very freestylable to me, however.
5566914	5569517	So I think if you're more of a freestyler, I don't know.
5569617	5575665	I think you may be liking some of the new songs, but it's definitely a perfect attacker's game.
5575765	5576586	That's my assessment.
5577267	5581632	Also like the fact that they have the Beatmania chart there where it does...
5582168	5587072	You know, it shows like a little graph that you can actually see where you sucked in the song and where you were good.
5587472	5590475	Yeah, again, things cater to perfect attackers.
5590615	5591055	I like that.
5591576	5595439	Again, because now everybody is screaming and hollering in the chat room.
5595499	5596620	As I said, it's a controversial thing.
5596740	5598361	Everybody feels very strongly one way or the other.
5598601	5600002	This is just my big fat opinion.
5600182	5601584	Take it, leave it, I don't care.
5604346	5605807	This is something I put in my good column.
5606187	5608129	It's not bad for a first mix.
5608990	5610511	Considering this is the very first...
5611203	5612403	I don't care how you want to put it.
5612543	5616184	You can't ignore that these people were obviously influenced by DDR significantly.
5616384	5617124	It's not a bad game.
5637277	5640019	I thought there was more places where you could rank.
5640820	5650308	I just thought the kind of ranking system was kind of cool, like you could rank in all these different spots, and every song had a top ten list, which I thought was kind of fun, so the ranking system was better.
5650929	5655493	If you're a mode whore, you're in for a treat, because this thing has about a zillion different modes on it.
5655633	5656594	I didn't even read them all.
5657455	5662599	I'm not a mode whore, I could give a shit, but if you're a mode whore, you're gonna have a blast.
5662800	5663060	Enjoy.
5663894	5664414	Zodiac by Banzai
5691408	5692750	I thought that song was really cool.
5694132	5696475	That's something I would like to play on the station sometime.
5697056	5700721	Maybe even do an In The Groove hour of songs or something, I don't know.
5701742	5705147	I thought some of the cheesy cover songs... Oh, you guys did that last week when I wasn't here?
5705962	5706483	All right, whatever.
5707123	5708685	I thought some of the cheesy... You guys, nothing.
5709906	5710486	Well, Loki.
5710546	5711307	Loki and Bradley.
5711507	5713268	The guys, not girl and guys.
5713549	5713789	All right.
5714089	5722356	I thought some of the cheesy cover songs were really... As a person who appreciates the gay music, I thought the dance covers of Mouth and Torn were really cute.
5722737	5723958	So I kind of like those songs.
5724058	5725219	And then Missing Heart.
5725399	5726920	There was like three Missing Heart songs in there.
5726940	5728441	I thought that was awesome because I like Missing Hearts.
5728782	5729162	It was cool.
5729322	5729502	What?
5730703	5731444	Oh, you have Zodiac.
5731484	5733526	Play a little clip of Zodiac for me because I like this song.
5734306	5734866	Pretty Please.
5735587	5736968	I actually thought this song was really cool.
5737188	5737989	Play a little bit for me.
5745454	5747095	This is a real fun one to dance to.
5747536	5749237	I thought this was like the best song in the whole mix.
5752299	5755782	At the same time though, it's probably the song that gets incredibly whored out.
5756923	5757683	So that's just my guess.
5760245	5761806	Alright, that was a little bit of Zodiac.
5761886	5762707	I like that song.
5763603	5765584	Uh, okay, that's what I have in the good column.
5765604	5766225	You ready for the bad?
5766605	5766825	Yeah.
5767045	5767305	Alright.
5770567	5772548	I'm gonna take a lot of shit for this comment, but I don't care.
5772588	5773569	This is how I honestly feel.
5773629	5786036	As somebody who's been a fan of DDR for four years, or, what, three or four years, however long it's been, I realize these guys are taking a lot of shit for it being a blatant, like, for people saying it's too much like DDR.
5786797	5787877	It is too much like DDR.
5788017	5789278	It is a blatant DDR ripoff.
5789538	5790679	I'm sorry, that's how I felt.
5791343	5792484	I felt like I was playing DDR.
5792544	5794825	I realize there's new stuff and they're trying to be different.
5795206	5798468	My only suggestion is that it's not different enough.
5798908	5804572	I think, now there's this whole argument going on about is it legal, is it not, is it legal, is it not.
5804812	5805953	I don't know where that stands.
5806093	5806533	I don't care.
5806593	5807173	It's not my issue.
5807314	5807834	What, Loki?
5808194	5809015	It is DDR.
5809095	5814678	It's only changed from DDR enough to make it not so they can't get sued.
5814959	5816179	That's pretty much what it is.
5816520	5817720	It's basically, that's it.
5817760	5820202	They only changed, they would have left it the same if they could have.
5821078	5827924	And also I think that since it's not an actually re-engineered DDR, that it's, you know, ground up, they can't say that they stole the engine.
5828044	5836692	But honestly, I think if Konami wanted to sue, and I don't know where this thing stands legally, but I think Konami does have a step to stand on.
5837513	5839215	It is way too much like DDR.
5839835	5840896	It's not different enough.
5841076	5843919	I felt like I was playing DDR, different mix.
5845681	5845761	Um...
5846599	5848239	I thought the interface was smooth.
5848679	5851660	The interface was very smooth, but I thought it was very dry.
5852080	5854641	The backgrounds were boring and the arrows were ugly.
5854701	5855661	It was an ugly game.
5856101	5857961	It was not a pretty game to look at.
5858381	5859982	It was an ugly interface, basically.
5860442	5860642	What?
5861222	5864083	Compared to Feet of Fury, how did those arrows look?
5864103	5866803	Okay, compared to Feet of Fury, it looked great.
5867123	5870884	But honestly, part of what attracted me to DDR in the beginning was that very...
5871661	5872903	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5888931	5890492	This is the thing that bugged me most about the game.
5890672	5892433	And I realize it bugs a lot of people too as well.
5892713	5895454	And I have played it, and I did get forced to do this in some songs.
5895834	5899596	I think hand plants are the stupidest thing in the entire game.
5899936	5901577	And the game acknowledges... You think you hand plant?
5902137	5902417	Yes.
5902938	5905539	But they're forced... That went out like years ago.
5906339	5907260	You can turn them off.
5907460	5911382	I was not able to... There were so many modes, I couldn't even see where to turn it off.
5911402	5912242	But that's fine.
5912442	5913843	I understand you can turn them off.
5914283	5916544	My point is, they are retarded in the first place.
5917045	5920868	They are really retarded, and they were not put smart.
5920949	5924972	Like, I was playing songs, and suddenly these hand plants would come up, and I just kind of sighed.
5925292	5927635	I did not feel like throwing my back out to hit them.
5927955	5928976	That's not dancing.
5929296	5932299	That is monkey flailing, is when you do those hand plants.
5932739	5933240	You know what?
5933260	5935762	And I realize it's borderline dancing at first, but the hand plants were stupid.
5935782	5942087	With everything you've said about in the group so far, even the good stuff, it doesn't sound enough to me to even give a rat's ass about it, honestly.
5942107	5942528	Well, I think...
5943436	5947959	I honestly think that everybody who is a fan of Bomani should try it once.
5948759	5949400	It's different.
5949520	5950380	It's worth a look.
5951361	5954363	Basically, my thing is form your own opinion.
5954483	5955403	Play it, form your own opinion.
5956084	5961367	Of course, if someone wants to play a really ass of dancing games, there was that Jaleco one.
5964709	5965309	What was that one?
5967050	5968791	Stepping Stage.
5969172	5970412	Yeah, I think that is Stepping Stage.
5970552	5971093	Stepping Selection.
5971113	5971793	Stepping Selection.
5971873	5972494	That was that one.
5975877	5977058	No game is as bad as that.
5978678	5988063	And I realize it's not really dancing in the first place, but the hand plants, it's what I hate about Pump It Up and it's what I hate about it in the group.
5988723	5990364	Sorry, that's just, I hated it.
5991884	5995386	I thought, this is going to sound really cold.
5995974	5999916	I thought it was kind of stupid that the step chart makers had a credit.
6000676	6004138	I'm not talking about something like it's in the credits of the game.
6004278	6013923	I'm talking about when you select a song and you go into the song, it shows in the same font size and type in the bottom corner, song name, song artist, and the step chart artist.
6015302	6017202	Well, the effort went into making the step charts.
6017222	6018083	You should have some credit.
6019043	6020503	I think the credit can be given at the end of the game.
6020543	6025324	This was the part that kind of bugged me, is that in most songs that I played, it was the same person every time.
6025845	6027545	Did that person put a lot of work in the game?
6027605	6028905	Sure, I'm not going to debate that.
6028945	6035807	But the thing is, I don't think that person deserves as much credit as the person who created the song, for God's sake, the artist and the song you're dancing to.
6036447	6039668	I realize it's a little thing, and I'm probably going to get shit for that comment, but I don't care.
6040228	6043409	It's something that struck me as kind of like, I kind of went, that's kind of dorky.
6043969	6046891	It's totally something, though, I would expect from the Sim scene.
6052655	6054396	If I was a beginner, I wouldn't want to play in the groove.
6054876	6056457	It has a really nice tutorial mode.
6056797	6057418	I'll give it that.
6057538	6059919	It's probably better than anything DDR has for beginners.
6060300	6065403	But kind of looking at it, if I was new and I was walking into the arcade and I was looking at it, I wouldn't want to play it.
6067697	6068837	But the interface is to hold turn off.
6069117	6074839	When I was playing, the CD skipped, and it caused the whole game to skip, and it caused the arrows to skip.
6075159	6079500	Kind of like the Ultramix glitch that some of the service packs have.
6079560	6081100	It's very similar to that effect.
6081620	6086161	And since this game is so heavily based on Perfect Attack, that is a big no-no.
6086701	6087622	That's a big no-no.
6088742	6089402	CD skipped.
6089582	6091362	Why the fuck is it running off of a CD?
6091882	6093323	It's got a fucking hard drive in it.
6093463	6094243	Run off the hard drive.
6094602	6095022	Okay, okay.
6095203	6097625	Yeah, why the game... The game should not be lagging at all.
6097805	6098946	That's what I gotta say.
6099286	6099687	No lag.
6100668	6106193	My thing is, I don't know if it's a CD skip or what it is, but it was like a CD skip.
6106333	6110156	And it was kind of... bad.
6110176	6113139	Uh... Lastly, I...
6113547	6113627	D.D.R.
6134399	6136159	What I would just say is, FoonMix did it better.
6137120	6140180	If you want to do the interface, Technolize did it better.
6140660	6144661	I'm sorry, you put FoonMix songs and steps with Technolize's theme.
6144721	6145881	I'm sorry, you've got a better game.
6146342	6147282	That's what it comes down to.
6148202	6152303	Well, that's one point, but I will agree with you that FoonMix's steps were better.
6153283	6156364	But FoonMix isn't an arcade game either, and I'm not talking about FoonMix right now.
6156384	6157524	So, alright, there's the bad.
6157584	6158984	So I gave you good, and I gave you bad.
6159484	6163045	My final assessment is that everybody should try it at least once.
6163900	6167642	But I honestly don't see this taking over DDR because here's my other point.
6167722	6170864	While I was in the arcade, I just kind of observed in the arcade as well.
6171324	6176147	While I was in the arcade, people were playing DDR non-stop.
6176307	6178188	People came up and were playing DDR non-stop.
6178308	6180929	I was one of three people the whole time I was there that played in the groove.
6181690	6184871	I watched in my time there DDR make twice as much money as in the groove.
6184991	6185972	A two-year-old game.
6186772	6189053	That's the reality as far as I can see.
6189073	6189974	You can't debate that.
6191434	6192374	Here's another thing, too.
6192695	6200718	Your average DDR mix, and I understand this is brand new hardware that they're adding to the scene and everything like that, your average DDR mix costs about $800 to upgrade.
6200758	6204300	If you were going to take a third mix machine, upgrade it to Extreme, it'd be about $800.
6204440	6210103	This sucker costs over $2,000 to upgrade for an arcade.
6210443	6221168	An arcade that's risking, you know, adding this, I mean, cause, you know, DDR Extreme, sure, it may not be pulling in the crowds it was before, but you've already got that game, it's already been paying for it, and it's already, it's still making money.
6221750	6222671	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6250916	6251996	This still will be good.
6252417	6254517	It's just... That's been proven right there at Food Mix.
6254557	6258999	I know that's not an arcade game, but it's all in-house artists, and the songs are really good.
6259719	6260719	That's what it comes down to.
6261079	6264441	Songs are good, steps were innovative, the backgrounds were awesome.
6265141	6267602	It's... They put more effort into it.
6267962	6268362	I'm sorry.
6270763	6271063	I don't know.
6271123	6272183	I'm not talking about Food Mix.
6272323	6275204	I want to finish up in the groove.
6275264	6277785	I don't want to leave it on such a sour note, because I did talk about a lot of bad stuff.
6277805	6280346	Again, I just want to reiterate, it's the first mix...
6281624	6282765	I think it can only get better.
6282885	6284485	For a first mix, it's not bad.
6284885	6293269	But to me, and this is kind of my final say on it, I left playing this game the same taste in my mouth that I get when I play Pump It Up.
6293469	6297571	And I don't mean physically, but I mean basically the way I kind of react to Pump It Up.
6297611	6299712	It's not like, oh, you know, cool, they have a Pump It Up.
6300092	6302393	Maybe I'll play that for fun once in a while.
6302893	6304454	That's exactly how I feel about In The Groove.
6304964	6306165	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
6327068	6329029	I'm going to open up the Skype line.
6329489	6337694	Maybe somebody wants to say something about it, but I'm not going to have it open very long because I want to get to the cage match because we're starting to run late.
6349637	6354859	But, yeah, I do want to allow, you know, if there's somebody that has a counterpoint, I want to give them a chance to speak back.
6355239	6359861	So, www.orangeonstrater.com, click on interact with us if you want to interact with the show.
6360421	6362441	And give us a shout on the Skype line.
6363462	6366643	And let's see what you have to say while I set up for the cage match here.
6367303	6373665	So, I guess In The Groove has gone gold or whatever and they're shipping to different arcades and what have you.
6373825	6375326	Oh, we're getting a call from our old buddy.
6375799	6376520	Jason!
6376580	6377140	What's up, Jason?
6377200	6378261	Of course, it's me.
6378521	6379142	Of course!
6379642	6380063	Of course.
6380223	6381464	But I love hearing from Jason.
6381524	6382225	What's up, Jason?
6382245	6383906	You got something you want to say about In The Groove?
6384807	6387469	There's a few things that are always on my mind about this.
6387890	6388190	Alright.
6388250	6390172	One little side note of something you said earlier.
6390452	6398319	Rocksaur Games made, basically they took the number one game that comes with most Linux distributions called Tux Racer.
6398982	6406445	It's basically a little racer with the penguin Tux mascot for Linux and they put it in an arcade game and shipped it out to arcades.
6408025	6409466	We actually have one out here.
6409586	6411427	I never knew that.
6411707	6412627	That's kind of funny.
6412927	6415628	If you go to the Rocks or Games Company website, there's two things.
6415888	6417109	Tux racer and the groove.
6417789	6418089	Anyways.
6419970	6422871	I guess you'll kind of leave it at that point then.
6422911	6424331	Alright.
6425552	6426612	The two things that are kind of
6426988	6433735	What's hanging me up about all this is that, first of all, the songs, I still want to hear all the songs.
6433855	6434796	I still want a soundtrack.
6434836	6435917	I still want to get all the songs.
6436077	6437358	I do want to play the game.
6437979	6447028	But already the variety is, you know, VR USA, a nice group of songs, but all along it's similar lines.
6448208	6449049	I'm sure there are.
6449189	6450551	I still want to play it.
6465509	6471594	but yeah, the main two things that are on my mind, I don't know how many people I've told this to, maybe two or three people.
6471634	6476557	We are about to tell two more, because that's how many people we have listening right now, two more.
6477558	6490228	The arcade manager, like something to do with the arcade hardware manager for Rockstar, was standing like at the corner of the Konami booth at E3, and I was just kind of watching everybody play Extreme, and we had a nice little discussion.
6490448	6493110	I remember that guy, I saw him too.
6494051	6494371	And it's
6495034	6499336	The two things that are hanging me up is that they're going to go for a copy of the Bomani series.
6500577	6503979	He said they have eventual plans to start cloning the other games.
6504339	6507781	Starting with Beatmania will most likely be their second.
6508502	6511323	It's a nice idea because it gets more games in the US.
6511483	6514545	It finally brings these here legitimately and with a variety.
6514865	6515566	That's a good thing.
6516246	6521549	At the same time, it's this little company undertaking this whole task of all of this.
6521989	6523310	I don't want to say they're just going to lose.
6524028	6526611	But, you know, this isn't an easy thing to take
6537306	6537626	I don't know.
6537946	6539027	It's a difficult situation.
6539227	6540567	It's a really difficult situation.
6540987	6546569	But I think if Konami has issue with what's going on here, they need to do something about it now before it does get out of control.
6547649	6549470	But maybe they can't do anything.
6549670	6551991	Maybe that's the sad part of it, is that maybe they can't do anything.
6552031	6558433	Well, Konami US no longer has an arcade division anyway.
6558473	6565875	The whole thing about that article was that they don't produce the machines here, but they can still get it through a third-party distributor.
6566403	6567883	and the bookkeeping is done in Japan.
6567983	6568403	Big deal.
6570724	6571564	I do want to play it.
6571624	6573604	If we ever got a machine here, I would play it.
6573744	6574464	I know I would.
6576525	6579205	I want to play it, but I just don't know what to expect from it yet.
6579285	6582706	I think big arcades with a lot of Bomani games should get in the groove.
6582746	6584486	It's just kind of a fun little alternative.
6584786	6594208	And actually, I can see, because I've heard that this place that I went to has these big Friday night tournaments and stuff, and it does seem like it's a very tournament-friendly game.
6594288	6595668	I'm kind of not surprised by that, so...
6597226	6598307	I don't get it.
6598327	6598607	Whatever.
6624996	6631638	I think big arcades that have lots of Babani games should get it just as an alternative, but I wouldn't recommend the whole world jumping on it.
6631658	6634458	Instead of having three, four, or five extreme machines all in a row?
6634758	6635518	Yeah, exactly.
6636179	6637519	There's no need for two extreme machines.
6637559	6639419	Get a fourth plus, and then get into the group.
6639439	6639539	Fifth!
6639719	6640320	Fifth!
6641420	6642160	Alright, or fifth.
6642200	6643700	Get a fourth plus or fifth, and then get into the group.
6643720	6644741	Fourth plus, fourth plus.
6645661	6645981	Alright.
6647721	6648321	That's it for now.
6649081	6649622	That's about it.
6649682	6651262	Is there anything else you want to say, Jason?
6651909	6657274	Console games are going to make this thing very interesting when they finally decide to start working on those.
6659456	6660977	I'm going to be brave and say it doesn't happen.
6663299	6669784	Obviously this isn't the authority, but ITG Freak already has locked forums in place for whenever that actually starts.
6670025	6671266	It is on their to-do list.
6672126	6675049	Feel free to prove me wrong, but I'm going to say right now it's not going to happen.
6676150	6678472	Feel free to prove me wrong, it's not going to happen.
6678592	6679613	We'll see what goes from here.
6679912	6693757	Okay, now supposedly, supposedly, that they have some sort of encryption thing that they did with this whole game on the hard drive on this thing where you couldn't, you know, say, I don't know, because it is basically Set Mania, you couldn't, I don't know, add songs to it.
6695078	6709203	Supposedly they have this, something tells me that they don't, and I think that all you're going to have to do is buy this game and be like, hey, you know what, I don't want to buy your next upgrade for this thing, because they weren't going to do downloadable updates or something like that, that was one of the things I think they were talking about.
6709941	6729256	And so basically you could say, you know, I like this DDR Extreme machine I have here, but what I'm going to do is I'm going to take all the songs from DDR Extreme that are already available for download on the internet, and I'm going to put them in this, you know, in the groove thing, and I'm going to call it In The Groove Plus.
6730177	6732438	And then I'm going to sell it for $3,000 on the internet.
6734000	6734400	You know what?
6734680	6735301	You know what's interesting?
6735481	6737302	And this is something I completely forgot to say about In The Groove.
6738503	6739604	I think what's going to be interesting about it
6740879	6747904	is that basically, yeah, the irony of the situation is is that everybody's going to pirate it to play on StepMania and then they won't bother within the group.
6748264	6750025	That's the irony of the whole thing, I think.
6751086	6754388	I think that's how, honestly, that's how most people are playing it right now.
6755069	6758311	Even better, there's people out there bootlegging fucking DDR Extreme.
6758571	6760773	What's going to stop them from fucking bootlegging this thing?
6760793	6763675	It's going to be even easier and they'll be able to make it even better.
6763695	6765576	That's going to hurt the smaller companies, too.
6765756	6768698	You know, the less backing a company has, the more it's going to hurt them.
6769239	6769539	All right.
6770074	6774739	I'm digging myself deep enough hole as it is here with the In The Groove fans.
6775199	6778182	We'll just end this and move along gradually back to the rest of the normal show.
6778943	6779763	Sounds normal.
6780965	6782326	Alright, thanks Jason for calling.
6785369	6790674	I am offering a cordial invitation to anybody that worked on In The Groove.
6791560	6801408	or anybody that worked on In The Groove or anybody that had something to do with the making of this game, I invite you to come on this show.
6801448	6803530	We will set up a phone interview or something.
6803810	6804571	Come on this show.
6804931	6805692	Talk about your game.
6805912	6807733	I would love to know what you guys have to say about this.
6807894	6809915	Honestly, come tell me I'm wrong.
6810976	6812277	Tell me there's going to be a home mix.
6812477	6815740	I am perfectly fine with this, but I want to hear it from the official horse's mouth.
6816541	6818422	So, open invite.
6818482	6819103	I'll be nice.
6820987	6822588	Come to California, we'll buy you lunch.
6822648	6824369	That's about all we can afford in our budget.
6824449	6826309	A nice McDonald's lunch for our guests.
6826730	6830091	But, you know, we can open it up to you.
6830151	6831192	Let's take one more call.
6831912	6832792	You're on Orange Lounge.
6834513	6834833	Hello?
6834873	6837394	Hey, your friendly neighborhood legend, Izaku.
6837434	6838315	Hey, Izaku, what's up?
6839495	6840756	I already played in the groove.
6841956	6846258	Obviously because I live in the city and Port Authority bus terminals and you were in the groove place.
6846779	6847219	What'd you think?
6848589	6849630	So far, so good.
6849710	6860240	I mean, the songs are unique for the fact that this is probably the only alternative left, our last hope, because, you know, we're hearing word that this might be it.
6861160	6864503	That, you know, DDR and the arcades might be on its last limb.
6864543	6865905	People are going to get sick and tired.
6866425	6867706	Hold on a second.
6867726	6867786	Yes?
6868627	6870609	Oh, I think somebody came in the room.
6871249	6871810	Hold on a sec.
6872130	6873091	Clean your room!
6873698	6882860	No, someone's asking for my roommate, but anyways, yeah, DDR, yeah, people have been playing Xtreme for almost two years, they're gonna get cranky and sick and tired.
6883080	6888922	But that's the thing, that's the thing, Zaku, is that I was at this place, and people were playing DDR Xtreme more than they were playing in the group.
6889202	6898264	Now, I realize it's just one day, and I realize it wasn't a tournament night or anything, but it was a Sunday afternoon, a random Sunday afternoon in the arcade.
6898740	6899921	and there were more people.
6899941	6902162	And it wasn't the same people playing DDR the whole time.
6902182	6903583	There were more people playing DDR.
6904443	6907845	It's not always... It's not always going to be... Oh, I'm sorry.
6907885	6908185	Hold on.
6908205	6911667	Okay, it's not going to always be tournament night at these other arcades.
6911827	6914989	If this isn't doing good in this arcade, it's not going to do good in another arcade.
6915750	6915990	Maybe.
6916010	6917831	It depends, though.
6917851	6918111	I mean...
6918920	6921000	Is that a princess phone ringing in the background?
6948281	6949062	Is that a princess phone?
6949082	6950943	That's not my phone, that's my roommate's phone.
6951784	6952064	Alright.
6952785	6954266	Your roommate has a princess phone?
6956407	6957748	Your roommate has a cute phone.
6960070	6961071	It just sounds adorable.
6961311	6962012	Sorry, Zaku.
6962292	6963913	Finish your thought, because we've got to get to Cage Match.
6963973	6969817	Yeah, he just left his phone right there, but... Finish your thought, Zaku.
6969837	6970838	We've got to go to Cage Match soon.
6970878	6972319	Well, pretty much it.
6972379	6973040	I mean, this is the...
6975089	6984994	Alright, in other words, let's just put it, to sum it all up, alternative, in the groove equals alternative for those who have been playing DDR Extreme for the longest, ever since it first came out.
6985554	6986315	I'll agree with you there.
6986695	6987495	This is transitional.
6987655	6988416	I'll agree with you there.
6989016	6989316	Period.
6989556	6989857	Alright.
6990497	6991177	Have a good one, Zaku.
6991777	6992398	Alright, later.
6992418	6992638	Later.
6993498	6997981	And that's the funny thing, I agree, it's an alternative, not a replacement for DDR.
6998261	7004604	But here's the funny thing, is that, you know, I say it at the same time, it's not a replacement for DDR, but yet it's, it is a rip-off of DDR.
7005646	7027832	Alright, anyway, before I say some more things that get me in trouble You know what, I didn't like Ultramix at first either And it suddenly became my favorite mix Home mix of all So, my opinion could change later on But for right now, that's how I feel Whatever, it's not all about me anyway As much as I like to think it is Hi guys, how are the rest of you guys doing?
7029392	7034974	Some of you guys look like you're falling asleep Sorry, I'll shut up about it in the room now
7036405	7037786	I want to get to the cage match.
7037926	7040248	Oh yeah, cage match, that thing's cool.
7040288	7041328	Yeah, let's get into the cage match.
7041348	7042129	I miss the cage match.
7042149	7052556	Alright, the way the Orange Lounge Radio cage match works, we play three songs for you guys, you guys pick your favorite, and it goes into rotation all week long here on Orange Lounge Radio.
7052576	7055798	We didn't do a cage match last week, so let's rewind to two weeks ago.
7056299	7065505	Jamie surprised us all when she beat Echo Image and something Loki had picked to win it with this Ska remix of Lupin the Third.
7066545	7068908	I think it's more like beach rock.
7084597	7085318	and here it is.
7085358	7088221	You only get to hear a clip of it because it was the last winner.
7088581	7091263	So here's a clip of song number one you can vote for tonight.
7091323	7093265	Remember, to participate, you need to be in our chat room.
7093706	7095607	www.orangeautorator.com Click on chat.
7095968	7097649	Here's song number one you can vote for tonight.
7098490	7099991	Tokyo Paradise Ska Orchestra.
7100051	7100812	Theme from Lumen III.
7111920	7112320	Let's go!
7112360	7112701	Let's go!
7112721	7113021	Let's go!
7139548	7140535	Thanks for watching!
7203477	7204959	Song number one in tonight's cage match.
7205279	7209424	Tokyo Paradise Ska Orchestra with a theme from Lupin the Third.
7209524	7210305	It's Lupin.
7210465	7211026	Lupin!
7211667	7212228	Lupin the Third.
7212248	7212808	Because it's French.
7213149	7213609	I know.
7214430	7214771	Lupin.
7215111	7215652	I like Lupin.
7216192	7217374	We're gonna watch some Lupin.
7217955	7221096	Alright, my turn, this is my pick for tonight's cage match.
7221356	7229999	I'm actually being lazy and just picking the song that I was going to play last week, because there was supposed to be a cage match last week, but, you know, things change, whatever.
7230799	7232119	So I'm just going to pick the same song.
7232319	7238961	And I actually had written a little spiel for you guys to read, so I'm just going to go ahead and read that spiel now.
7239021	7240542	Let's see who's at the door.
7242642	7243743	Oh, hello, Jonas is here.
7243783	7244243	Alright, anyway.
7244856	7249418	This is the little thing I was going to have Jamie read last week before the cage match.
7250098	7250959	Except I was dead.
7251059	7251539	That's alright.
7252159	7258362	Since you cunts voted out Echo Image last week, I was going to pick Britney or some shit to torture you with in my absence.
7258922	7264285	But this pretty kick-ass trance song came to my attention, and Jamie, I know how much you love trance.
7266109	7269273	But it kind of sounds like tack in one part of it, so just listen to it.
7270315	7276604	And also, I know Loki has a total hard-on for this artist, so I thought I'd beat him to the punch by putting this in tonight's cage match.
7276884	7278827	It's also kind of long, so deal with it.
7279287	7282512	This is song number two, Ono Ken, with Vijore.
7282952	7283273	Enjoy.
7287296	7289839	Can I ask you a question?
7318004	7318624	Thank you for watching!
7413015	7413475	Thank you.
7477995	7478735	DarkSakura.com
7503621	7504464	Thanks for watching!
7676347	7680349	Alright, song number two in tonight's cage match, Ono Ken with Vigore.
7680529	7680969	Jamie!
7681789	7682449	I really liked it.
7682609	7695594	It wasn't... The trance I am sick of is the cookie cutter repetitive crap trance that people... Feel the beat, feel the beat, feel the beat, feel the beat, feel the beat.
7695814	7700296	That was a lot more, what's the word I'm thinking of, progressive sounding.
7700436	7702957	That was more what I liked.
7703502	7704843	You liked it, and that's an upset.
7704883	7705724	Well, yeah, I liked it.
7706225	7707446	It's a trance that you like.
7707847	7710549	But cage match-wise, it was a little long.
7711050	7713492	I mean, I would listen to it all the time otherwise.
7713532	7715935	I mean, that would be one of my songs on repeat.
7715995	7718117	I would have to give it that high of a rating.
7718678	7725725	However, because of Link, for cage match purposes, I would give it an 8, and this would be what I would have originally given it would have been a 9 otherwise.
7726704	7727104	Fair enough.
7727784	7730925	Jonas, who just came in the house a little bit ago, explicit.
7731425	7732566	There's Mike over there for you guys.
7733306	7735786	I know you got to hear a little bit of Ono Ken, so what did you think of Ono Ken?
7736667	7737487	Hold the bottom when you talk.
7737847	7738167	That's all.
7738527	7738967	Alright, what's up?
7739948	7740928	I'll give it a 9 out of 10.
7741368	7741808	Alright, good.
7742248	7742568	Alright.
7743148	7743588	Well put.
7744729	7745929	Angel, your thoughts?
7747389	7749190	I really liked it.
7750050	7751611	Kind of ravey, just my style.
7751711	7752951	Definitely a 10 from me.
7755401	7757542	My thoughts is I really liked it.
7758063	7764608	It could stand to have been a little shorter, but I'm just lazy, so I give it a 9, because it's not the song's fault that I'm lazy.
7765308	7765669	Loki.
7767250	7767710	It was good.
7767890	7771153	I've listened to it before, so I actually didn't even listen to the whole song at all.
7773154	7774555	Because I've had this one forever.
7775216	7775997	So on a scale of 1 to 10?
7776137	7780460	I give it a 9, because it's... I wonder if you can do no wrong.
7781343	7784805	Fair enough, and lastly but not, or I'm sorry, lastly but not leastly.
7785786	7788047	I almost said lastly but not lastly.
7788567	7788908	Arcadia.
7788928	7790529	You said last but not loosely.
7791989	7792930	We never knew that you were loosely.
7792950	7793330	It was pretty cool.
7793370	7797613	It reminded me of something out of DDR or 2DX or something.
7797733	7804537	It had that background that was sort of, it was a bit repetitive on the background, but still it was pretty cool.
7805478	7805798	I give it a 9.
7807068	7809550	Didn't you kind of get a little bit of a Taku vibe from it?
7809610	7811411	Like, Still My Words-ish?
7811592	7818077	No, there was another one that was... Like, what are those song tracks?
7818337	7819438	Yeah, like Traces.
7819898	7821079	Yeah, it made me think of Traces.
7823741	7829986	Okay, let's go on to Loki's pick, and I think he tried to come up with something at the last minute, but I don't think it worked.
7830006	7831367	He's going back to an old favorite.
7832395	7835998	No, I wasn't trying to come up with anything in the last minute, I was just seeing if I wanted to do any new shit.
7836498	7837259	But, I had to check.
7837439	7840461	And that also reminds me that fuckin' Diverse Systems hasn't sent me my CD.
7840862	7846826	Now, I understand that there's a little problem with that they weren't offering it to the US, but I thought I'd try ordering it anyway.
7847507	7848348	And they have my money.
7848828	7850009	And I don't have a CD.
7850249	7850970	And that makes me mad.
7851970	7852971	As long as they send me a CD.
7853912	7861538	But, anyways, um, so... No, I went ahead and decided that I'm gonna go ahead and try the Echo Image card again.
7862315	7863296	Thank you for watching!
7908996	7909998	Thank you for watching!
7952569	7953530	Thanks for watching!
8015097	8016257	Thanks for watching!
8038075	8039276	Music Music Music Music
8078981	8080628	Thanks for watching!
8182367	8189309	Song number three in tonight's cage match Echo Image with Come Back Jamie, come back and give us your vote
8192257	8193338	Oh, did I miss something?
8193418	8194038	Yes, you did.
8194098	8194618	Echo Image.
8194738	8195098	Oh, yeah.
8195858	8196559	It was good.
8196619	8197619	I really liked that song.
8198600	8206102	It was just so... I mean, again, that would be another one that I would just listen to endlessly, but I don't think it was quite cage-matchy.
8206883	8208463	Still, I'm giving it an 8.
8209584	8209984	All right.
8210524	8210844	Fair enough.
8210864	8211184	Bradley.
8216366	8217067	Gotta grab a thing.
8219928	8220408	Oh, for me...
8221240	8225283	The background is pretty good, but the lyrics and the way it's sung is kind of blah.
8226064	8228005	So, I'll give it a 6.
8229386	8229806	Alright.
8230507	8230787	Angel.
8233249	8236031	Um, duh, Echo Image 10.
8236892	8238633	I know, I've been giving a lot of 10s lately, huh?
8238693	8239754	You're the 10 whore.
8240254	8241235	I'm not a 10 whore.
8241935	8244477	You're DDR Angel USA 10th Mix.
8244577	8244898	Alright.
8244918	8248060	No comment.
8250102	8250622	Exquisite.
8251535	8252655	8.5 out of 10.
8254176	8255656	Alright, 8.5 out of 10.
8256337	8259618	My thoughts, you know what, it's kind of, this is really hard for me.
8259938	8262739	Because that is like my favorite song at the moment right now.
8262879	8263919	I love that song.
8264399	8267700	And in most normal circumstances, I would give that song an 11.
8268220	8275822	But the problem is that I kind of feel the way Jamie does where it's not quite the song I would see winning Cage Match.
8275862	8280824	It is kind of slow and like, I think if that played in the middle of a dance music station, it would be kind of weird.
8283036	8285958	So I'm taking my 11 and bringing it down to like a 9.9.
8287780	8289882	Alright.
8289942	8291683	But you know what, it's not up to us, it's up to you guys.
8291723	8292404	Oh, Loki's got a vote.
8293045	8294706	Well, duh, I do, don't I?
8295947	8300732	No, I give it an 11 because I'm still listening to this in my car over and over again.
8300752	8304115	I don't even know how long I've had this CD for and I still have listened to it.
8305265	8306026	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8323946	8327072	Echo Image, CompuPhonic, you must get this CD.
8327252	8328375	It is so good.
8328976	8330699	That's all I listened to while I was back east.
8330739	8332041	It was the only CD I had on me.
8332602	8333504	And I'm still not sick of it.
8333624	8334005	I love it.
8335047	8335548	But anyway.
8336880	8337921	Enough about what I think.
8337961	8339042	Let's get to what you guys think.
8339202	8341444	And your chance to vote on tonight's winner.
8341504	8343887	Here are those three songs one more time.
8343907	8348331	Starting with a theme from Lupin the Third by Tokyo Paradise Ska Orchestra.
8357780	8361003	Alright, song number two tonight was Onoken with Vijore.
8371565	8376614	And song number three tonight was Echo Image with Come Back.
8391154	8393855	All right, place your vote now.
8393976	8397897	Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.
8398158	8401359	And Loki just found something on the internet that's very cool that we must find.
8402200	8405681	They sung the NeverEnding Story, or a version of it.
8406021	8406542	Echo Image.
8406702	8408623	Echo Image did a version of NeverEnding Story, it looks like.
8409103	8412565	Yes, I don't know if it's the same song, but it's got the same title, so I'm going to look for it.
8412965	8413765	All right, we'll find out.
8414986	8417267	Okay, so anyway, those are the three you get to vote for right now.
8417347	8419268	Lupin, Vigore, or Comeback.
8422319	8424700	Alright, I'm going to open up the Skype line one more time.
8424860	8431163	Any of your thoughts you want to talk to us about DDR Extreme USA, certainly, in the groove.
8431363	8433064	We'll definitely want to hear your thoughts on that.
8433984	8437286	Or anything you want to bring up right now, fine by me.
8439100	8442002	And we will get into, of course, the cage match.
8442902	8444203	Not the cage match, the FUs of the week.
8444804	8445284	In a little bit.
8445745	8448227	I want to give you guys a chance for your votes to come in first, though.
8449047	8452630	Loki, in the meantime, while we're waiting for a call, anything going on in the sim world this week?
8454091	8454692	A few things.
8455172	8457994	Alpha 24 came out last week, but I'll mention it again.
8459195	8461197	Nothing really new, I think, came with that.
8461357	8462858	Except more bug fixes.
8462998	8464739	And then, uh, Technolize...
8465962	8473108	Version 2.8 finally got released with new, supposedly another Easter egg thing in that, probably some cool stuff in the background.
8473509	8478893	And they have their unlock, or the unlock mode stuff is in there.
8478933	8482396	They finished all the stuff for that and fixed some of the Alpha 24 problems.
8483457	8490964	And there's also a poll going on DDR Maniacs right now, because the guy that did all the character ripping for 5th Mix is pretty much done with it now.
8491391	8497155	And now he wants to know what other games you want to rip characters from, and he will go ahead and get on that.
8497275	8501698	So I went ahead and voted for, I think, Party Collection or something.
8501758	8506242	They wanted to do Ultramix, but I figured there's only two characters in Ultramix, so that's kind of a waste.
8506602	8511085	So they're doing that right now, and I think that's pretty much it.
8511105	8514788	There's not really much going on right now other than that.
8515528	8517350	Sort of sim-related, they're going to have...
8518376	8519096	Thank you for watching!
8540430	8560284	Wave, or the Fura Fura mode, and .5 speed and all that wonderful stuff, and Break, that you can find in the arcade mixes, which is a free download I might add on DDRAmerica.com, a BitTorrent site, and you can actually, if you have a really kind operator at your local arcade, you can give that to them, and I'm sure they'll put it in there for you.
8561205	8561585	Like ours.
8562185	8565688	So, that's pretty much all that's going on at the moment.
8568830	8569911	Alright, fair enough.
8572951	8575693	How long ago did you order that Diverse Systems CD that you still haven't gotten?
8576613	8577374	A couple months ago.
8578555	8578875	Interesting.
8578895	8579575	Are you going to write them?
8579835	8581416	Contact the Better Business Bureau over it?
8582297	8582837	They're Japanese.
8582857	8584218	They can't understand my English.
8584939	8586660	So, I'll try.
8586980	8594365	I'll ask them, you know, hey... Because I still have the email, so I could email them again with that email later on once...
8595101	8598884	I'm thinking that they're just not releasing to the US, so they're not going to send it to me.
8599224	8606909	But later on, when the time comes when they do release it to the US, I'll be like, hey, I paid for this a long time ago, send me my fucking CD.
8607549	8608970	So that's pretty much what it's going to come down to.
8609651	8613433	And they'll have to, because I have my receipts still from that.
8613593	8617336	It shows that it was paid for, so there's no disputing that.
8617436	8620998	They can just say no, and then, I don't know.
8621246	8625568	When you're dealing with international business, they don't necessarily have to send it to you.
8625708	8628589	The business laws overseas are a lot different than they are here.
8630490	8631490	Well, I don't think it would be a problem.
8631510	8634872	And you can't necessarily report a foreign business to the Better Business Bureau.
8635392	8636592	Well, I wasn't going to do that anyway.
8636792	8643115	But I mean, I'm saying, if they don't ship it to you and you paid for it, there's not really much you're going to be able to do about it.
8644115	8644335	Yeah.
8645836	8646076	Oh, well.
8647497	8649097	If not, I'm out that 50 bucks.
8649538	8650398	Not that it really matters.
8652190	8652931	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
8677972	8678813	Tell me you didn't get your product.
8678953	8682915	Alright, anyway, let's talk about Cage Match and the winner of tonight's Cage Match.
8686037	8690520	Two of the songs did alright, but it wasn't enough to beat the third song.
8690560	8694402	Tonight's Cage Match winner is... Echo Image!
8699185	8703467	Songs number one and two tied, but it weren't enough to overtake song number three.
8703788	8706009	Song number three got about what one and two did combined.
8708855	8710456	Yeah, the power of Shane persuasion.
8710917	8712278	Shane's persuasion in the chat room.
8715021	8717603	Damn him for being a DDR celebrity all of a sudden.
8717623	8720226	You know, people wouldn't have given a shit what he said previously.
8720867	8721667	Just teasing you, Shane.
8721988	8724050	Alright, let's do another break.
8724070	8727753	Are you saying that now his words have a laxative effect when it comes to opinions?
8729335	8729836	Possibly.
8731098	8731398	All right.
8732098	8733418	We're going to go to a break.
8733959	8734679	No, actually, you know what?
8735079	8736859	In all seriousness, I'm glad that song won.
8736879	8740200	I just kind of, you know, I'm still kind of like, I don't know.
8740500	8744200	But some people, when they voted for it, they actually said, I want to see a slow song on Orange Lounge.
8744220	8745581	You did close the voting awfully early.
8746101	8746621	I know, I did.
8746821	8747481	But I'm just a dick.
8747621	8747881	All right.
8747921	8748961	People didn't get theirs in.
8749621	8752022	Well, they need to wake up and get in on it.
8752522	8753402	I don't think it would have been enough.
8753562	8756922	We were several, several votes behind Jamie, so I don't think it would have been enough.
8757723	8759743	When it's pretty clear one song's going to win...
8761383	8763145	All right, anyway, let's go to a break.
8763325	8769931	And in this break, I'm going to pick up kind of a lot of those leftover songs we haven't gotten to yet from DDR Extreme USA, including one of my favorites, Diving.
8770511	8771652	I like that song by Four Strings.
8772333	8774335	Like a Virgin and YMCA.
8774475	8776096	We're also going to gay it up a little bit in this break.
8776877	8779980	When we come back... Dude, I saw them perform that.
8781161	8781661	That's hot.
8781961	8782822	That was awesome.
8783002	8785424	When we come back, the FUs of the week.
8785825	8787827	You know it, you love it, and it's coming up.
8787867	8788287	We'll be back.
8814379	8821040	So much that we should have done I was into Cuba Now I'm stuck Driving Knowing it was you I keep on trying
8875976	8876597	Thanks for watching!
8935778	8936304	Thank you.
8985543	9013270	Young man, there's no need to feel down I said, young man, pick yourself up around I said, young man, cause you're in a new town There's no need to be unhappy Young man, there's a place you can go I said, young man, when you're short on your dough You can stay there, and I'm sure you won't find many ways to

9046235	9048666	You can do whatever you feel
9077392	9077973	and DarkSakura.com.
9092119	9094140	What's up with that Village People song?
9094260	9095881	Is it just me, or did it sound different?
9095941	9098383	It doesn't sound like the same YMCA I remember.
9098503	9101044	It sounded like they re-recorded it or something.
9101064	9103886	You are not putting your nasty foot on the webcam.
9104587	9109469	Loki is changing out the bandage on his foot right now, and he wants to put it on the webcam to scare you all with.
9109590	9112271	Look at his Silent Hill, you know, toe.
9112531	9114653	Loki, how was it to play DDR with that foot?
9114713	9115393	That's what I want to know.
9116414	9119095	Ooh, I see that NeverEnding Story thing on WinMX.
9119115	9120116	I'm going to double-click it, okay?
9120874	9121514	I'm so excited.
9121895	9123516	That echo image, never-ending story thing.
9123536	9125277	I hope we get that by the end of the show so we can play it.
9125437	9126657	That is nasty.
9126897	9127178	Anyway.
9127578	9129299	I can't believe you're putting that on cam.
9129359	9130459	It's so gross.
9132601	9133461	I want to type.
9133541	9134882	I don't want to look at your ugly tongue.
9134942	9135282	Alright.
9135802	9138904	Again, we've been playing a lot of EXUSA songs for you guys.
9138964	9142066	I know a lot of you guys missed Maximizer a little bit earlier.
9142106	9143907	You didn't get a chance to hear Maximizer.
9148434	9149475	and that's all you're going to hear of it now.
9149895	9158602	But don't forget, all these EXUSA songs are in rotation all week long now on Orange Lounge Radio in our 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
9158922	9165427	Bomani Music and More program is on and all the Extreme USA songs are in there for your listening pleasure.
9165888	9166528	We always update.
9166548	9167889	We like to stay up to date for you guys.
9168810	9170451	And we'll be putting other new songs in.
9170491	9171812	I can't wait for Ultramix 2 to come out.
9171832	9172933	I'm going to have field day with that one.
9174174	9177957	Also, on our station on Monday nights, tune in for Diversion
9178839	9182302	Your favorite fan-made and official Bomani remix songs.
9182382	9183083	It's really good.
9183123	9185024	A lot of industrial-sounding songs in there and stuff.
9185345	9186245	Really good remixes.
9186345	9187326	Tune in if you haven't yet.
9187887	9189608	7 o'clock Pacific Time on Monday night.
9189688	9192450	And then Tuesday nights... That would be where I step in.
9193371	9195973	That's Pump Up the Volume on Orange Sound Radio.
9196613	9202118	It's where I'm basically supposed to play people's requests, except nobody ever requests things anymore.
9203226	9204867	So I just play whatever the hell I feel like.
9204947	9207707	Usually I'll play a whole CD or marathon stuff.
9207807	9214389	I was so completely impromptu last week, I just decided to play Dressed to Kill Again, the Eddie Izzard routine.
9216250	9221472	Pre-show starts at 7 o'clock, or sometimes at a quarter till 7 if I'm bored.
9222112	9228734	And then the show starts at 7.30 to 10.30, and if I'm bored I go longer if I lose track of time or if I forget to go to bed.
9229294	9231235	So I play everything.
9231255	9232435	I play everything from...
9233473	9234654	Let's see, what did I play last week?
9234694	9240058	I played the DDR EX V-Rare 3 CD.
9240879	9244621	I played some comedy.
9244762	9249045	I played, you know, some Metallica.
9249165	9249985	I just play everything.
9250046	9254949	So, since I've got a pretty, you know, diverse sense of taste for music.
9256711	9256991	Alright.
9257171	9257791	It's a good time.
9258072	9258452	Yeah, listen.
9258472	9258592	Listen.
9259171	9261732	Wednesday nights, 7 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.
9262152	9272555	We'll be back this Wednesday after a little bit of a hiatus, but Rice Princess, LankyStyle, and myself, we bring you a little show called Outside the Box, which is a show dedicated to video gaming.
9272995	9278216	The other games, besides that DDR and foot stomping and beat hitting games.
9278604	9279704	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9307589	9311310	Why is it for 113 weeks in a row now we have to do the FUs of the week?
9312090	9316051	Because I'm still full of angst and I can't make it stop.
9331755	9334636	I would like to give a big FU to the majority of the human race.
9336808	9338049	For one very big reason.
9338609	9343612	There's a stupid moron who ran out in front of my car on Madison Avenue while I'm going 60.
9343892	9350055	I would have hit him had he continued.
9350695	9354597	Asshole decides that he's... Oh, there's a Tercel heading to me.
9354977	9356598	And so he jumps out back into the lane.
9357038	9360800	And I'm just like, looking... I managed to slow down enough.
9360840	9363181	I was going about 20 where I got where he would have been.
9363501	9364502	And I'm just looking at this guy like,
9365143	9366704	Oh my god, what planet are you from?
9366724	9371328	Are you from the planet of, like, perpetually flat people, you know, because they all get run over by cars?
9372609	9373710	You stupid fucker.
9373750	9380115	And then there's, like, the guy on the motorcycle who, like, decides that he's going to speed up when I'm trying to change lanes.
9380135	9387921	And I'm halfway into the goddamn lane, and then he blows... Oh, what... I just... Yeah, I was going 60 on Madison.
9387981	9389603	I usually go 60 on Madison.
9390043	9392245	It was in the 50s, and it was only 10 miles over.
9394532	9395692	Don't, oh my god, me?
9396613	9397133	Okay, anyway.
9398833	9415616	So, uh, I was, uh, there's also, like, this old lady who was in front of the line, um, at, uh, um, the grocery store, who decided that she was gonna be the slowest person ever.
9416016	9417236	This is in the express lane.
9417676	9420997	They finally get out of the lane, and then they change cashiers and start counting out the door.
9421017	9422017	I'm like, what?
9422057	9422317	What?
9423030	9448162	and then like a big actually goes to all that Chinese food and all like the carby food I've been eating all weekend because I decided that I was gonna gonna cheat like mad all weekend and I have and now my stomach hurts but I had coconut cream pie this weekend and that makes it all right and I want to go have a beer I had coconut cream pie when I was on the east coast it was very good it was at a little truck stop style diner too I went to the Hofbrau
9449031	9449992	Huffbrow!
9450492	9451473	You can't call it the Huffbrow.
9451493	9452394	The Huffbrow!
9452474	9453134	Huffbrow!
9454556	9456998	Especially in a town where Arnold Schwarzenegger is governor.
9457038	9457398	Come on.
9457898	9458999	It's the Huffbrow!
9461401	9467106	And F you to the situation where people say, Oh sure, we'll call you when we're ready to eat.
9467206	9469208	And then they go out to eat already.
9469568	9469788	And then...
9473234	9485565	An F you goes toward a friend's parent for saying something, for completely making an assumption about something that my fiance had said and for just going off on them with no reason.
9485765	9491650	Okay, first of all, when you assume it makes an ass out of you and me, okay?
9492531	9495693	You learn this when you're in middle school, okay?
9495974	9496234	Okay?
9496880	9503465	And then another F you goes to all the people who drive like huge luxury sedans and SUVs who park in compact places.
9504386	9505767	Your car is not little.
9506187	9509310	And also learn how to fucking stay in the lines, okay?
9509330	9515735	If you're gonna park your car there, if there's nowhere else to do it, at least keep your car between the lines so that other people can park.
9517436	9521540	I used to go around to people who did that at school and pour honey on their driver's side door.
9522560	9523161	On the handle.
9523601	9524422	In the middle of summer.
9524909	9525649	You're so mature.
9525829	9530651	And I would go back and check the handle when I was leaving, and there would be flies on it, and it would be awesome.
9532571	9534892	This was, you know, when I was first in school.
9535592	9540214	But, it's like, these are the people that I leave notes on their car now.
9541194	9548717	You know, the other day, I left a diagram on how to properly park the car on the top of this SUV.
9549077	9552638	Also, another F you goes toward the H, too, for looking stupid.
9553726	9555087	Okay, what was wrong with the Hummer?
9555567	9556447	Rob, what was wrong with the Hummer?
9556467	9556767	Do you know?
9557608	9558148	Uh, everything.
9558488	9559028	I'm just kidding.
9559808	9561129	They look cool.
9561589	9562850	They were tough.
9563170	9567211	And now they're all like, hi, we're going to look completely suburban.
9567371	9569392	Aren't those those square cars, the Hummers?
9569432	9570232	Yeah, they were awesome.
9570693	9571453	They're square!
9571833	9572513	They're cool!
9573974	9575014	Alright, whatever.
9575435	9578156	And I want to put a rocket launcher on one and drive it to work.
9579856	9581657	And it's just...
9582751	9584032	Okay, I've got the inked scalp.
9584072	9586713	That's really my major B. Alright.
9587473	9587733	You sure?
9587773	9588873	I should have ran over that guy.
9589294	9589434	Alright.
9589754	9590654	Yeah, I think you should have too.
9590714	9591334	Teach him a lesson.
9591494	9592175	Darwinizen.
9592195	9594556	Well, let's move on to, uh, Loki!
9597577	9599157	I'd like to say that I can't be that bad.
9599297	9599858	What the hell?
9600338	9603039	Uh, my first time using those erupt chairs is, um, okay, there we go.
9603399	9603979	Okay, that was easy.
9604379	9610722	Um, uh, actually, I'm not that mad right now because I just noticed I'm getting a whole lot of new echo images and that makes me happy.
9611309	9613970	But my main FU goes to my toe, because it hurts bad.
9614210	9622311	I mean, it doesn't, it's just, it hurts more with the, like, where they poke the needle in, because it's actually bruised, and if you touch it, it's really tender, and it's like, ugh.
9622851	9627832	Now, my toe looks really nasty, and it burns every now and then, so that's kind of bad.
9628132	9631933	But, you know, I should just have gone to the doctor earlier, and we wouldn't have this problem.
9632453	9635093	So that's, you know, a rule for everybody.
9635113	9639354	If you have a problem, don't wait it out, because you don't know
9639997	9641218	The doctor knows better than you do.
9641478	9645139	So just go to the doctor, take care of... And that's it.
9645539	9652682	And, um... OtherFU goes to Paranoia Eternal on hand-to-feet mode for breaking my lamp.
9653002	9657704	That wasn't my fault, that was purely DDR Extreme's fault for breaking the lamp.
9659225	9663487	And... Finally, um... I don't know.
9663687	9665087	That's pretty much all I've got.
9665268	9666368	Oh, um... Oh, yeah.
9666748	9668509	Fuck you to goddamn...
9669856	9675179	Jack in the Box for being fucking slow because they burned the stupid chicken tenders.
9676460	9676860	Stupid.
9678841	9679502	But that's all.
9680282	9680602	I'm done.
9688721	9702223	F you to myself for not taking Monday off of work because after leaving on a two week trip I really should have taken the next couple days off so I could just relax and catch up with everything I missed but F you to being gone so long because I missed everybody and it was sad but I'm back now and everything's better
9702805	9704506	We missed you too, but our aim's improving.
9704687	9705627	I know, you're trying.
9706928	9710931	F you to the mall where the DDR pad was broken.
9710991	9711712	That kind of pissed me off.
9711732	9716416	F you to the same jack-in-the-box because that was my chicken tenders they burned and I had to go back and do.
9716516	9718978	And they could have, you know, given us an update or something, but whatever.
9720879	9727384	F you to all these video games coming out all at once that I want to buy and I'm not having, like, enough money to buy them all.
9727444	9728465	But, you know, I'll live.
9729185	9729326	And...
9731252	9732093	I guess that's really it.
9732513	9733534	I don't have a whole lot of angst.
9733574	9734095	I never do.
9734815	9735856	I'm a nice person.
9737078	9742703	Okay, maybe not, but I'm just... I'm not feeling very creative tonight, so... Oh, I thought of one.
9743484	9749649	F you to the fact that my flight got delayed leaving from Phoenix into California, into Sacramento, because...
9750618	9754321	We all get on the plane and we're all sitting there and it's a full flight and it's just all packed.
9755281	9758263	I don't like all those people being so close to all those people to begin with.
9758683	9765308	Especially when you're sitting next to somebody whose arm is all up in the armrest and it feels like they're invading your personal space and stuff.
9766048	9766989	Anyway, I don't like that.
9768450	9772092	And then being told that, oh, we're missing a part.
9772172	9774154	We have to go change a part on the plane.
9774274	9776675	And then we're stuck there for like 20 minutes while they change a part.
9776695	9777656	Sigh.
9779609	9782831	All right, let's get to some other FUs in studio.
9782891	9783671	Let's start off.
9783711	9784651	Who's got a microphone?
9786012	9786852	Somebody's got to have one.
9787052	9787572	Oh, God.
9787612	9788153	Here he comes.
9788233	9791254	Jonas with his FUs of the week.
9792794	9794915	I'll keep it as fast as possible.
9796055	9796456	Okay.
9797256	9801878	I'm going to give an FU to work for not giving me some free time.
9801918	9803498	I need to spend some time with my family.
9803538	9806579	I can't keep getting five days a week.
9809781	9810982	First of all, I have school as well.
9811002	9812562	Some of us work and go to school.
9813583	9815383	I know that, but I have to take care of family as well.
9815423	9817164	I gotta move, because I'm moving somewhere.
9817244	9819025	I'm moving to another house.
9821586	9821906	Okay.
9823006	9829989	F you to... F you to some asshole after buying my car for...
9831536	9851017	some asshole after borrowing a car for without my permission to actually change the fluids of the inside like you don't put fucking engine oil on to where the coolant is supposed to be at that ain't fucking cool my car fucked up there
9853553	9857575	And FU for not being able to play DDR Extreme for the PS2.
9857895	9859716	I'm hearing some pretty good reviews towards it.
9860736	9864638	FU for maximize your steps to being sucky as hell.
9867059	9870321	FU to RVGL for not fixing their goddamn pads.
9870361	9872562	I wanted to try that EX2, I wasted a dollar for nothing.
9873942	9875423	Not to mention some extra gas money.
9878516	9881557	FU to someone throwing tacks on the road.
9882037	9882777	God dammit.
9884698	9889720	And people, people, people don't know what to do, when to quit.
9890120	9893661	So you think you're gonna throw a bunch of tacks on the road and say, ha ha ha.
9896242	9901963	And FU for double parking in the school area.
9902484	9906825	God dammit, we all have to park as well, not just one car hogging two lanes.
9908533	9912414	And thanks to that, I actually failed the damn midterm because of that.
9913034	9914514	Because I was 30 minutes late with class.
9916575	9920455	And since I have to keep the FU shorts, might as well give it to someone else.
9920775	9921156	All right.
9921636	9922276	Bradley.
9923096	9923956	Bradley, your FU's.
9925196	9925576	All right.
9926297	9926837	Let's see.
9927677	9929477	Fuck you to politics as usual.
9931638	9937499	Fuck you to lazy dumb shits in parking lots who leave their...
9938618	9944760	Grocery stores that leave their fucking grocery carts out in the middle of the spaces.
9945440	9951802	So fucking annoying, you can come up to a space and be like, oh, I can go park here, oh no, the dumb shit put the fucking carts in the middle of the space.
9953103	9957684	If you put it up in one of the meaty little things and it's not in the way, that's okay.
9958404	9966387	It's still annoying and you're a lazy ass for not taking it to the receptacle or back to the store, but if it's in the way, it's a bitch.
9966917	9968638	Okay, let's see, what else?
9971159	9974600	Fuck you to being lazy after work and not really getting much done.
9976841	9987365	And I'll give a fuck you to dial-up for being slow, and that being part of the reason it takes forever to go read LiveJournal and check up on everything.
9989966	9990446	That's about it.
9991386	9992747	DDR Angel, your FUs of the week.
9997386	10004188	I don't really have that many FUs this week.
10006669	10013851	I was getting all excited about Final Fantasy XI until Andrew just text messaged me and said my video card might not like it.
10014051	10014891	So FU to that.
10015592	10016652	But maybe we'll get that fixed.
10018559	10020962	Yeah, that's me.
10021042	10022724	Yeah, maybe the benchmark will fix it.
10022804	10023184	I don't know.
10025367	10026168	Oh, yeah, the benchmark.
10026208	10026829	Oh, yeah, we have that.
10026849	10027289	Never mind.
10027309	10029111	Yeah, I've heeded that.
10029211	10033496	I hope to get that fixed tomorrow so I can play with the rest of the group.
10034317	10035018	I guess that's it.
10035078	10037221	There's not really that much to... Oh, yeah, and I've heeded my...
10039188	10046137	My computer science teacher for getting our webpage project that was due like Friday.
10046198	10049422	He's like, oh, okay, hold the screen on Monday so you guys can do your presentation.
10049442	10052266	It's like, dork, you're the one that said you were going to bring it in on Wednesday.
10052446	10053007	Well, whatever.
10053027	10054809	Yeah, that's it.
10056578	10057879	All right, let's get to our chatroom FUs.
10057899	10059119	I've got to make this quick tonight.
10059199	10061820	If you sent a bunch, they're getting cut, just to warn you.
10062280	10066462	DarkLion, FU to myself for giving Sky the song Regulus over the Clouds mix.
10066502	10068803	I told you not to play it while I was in San Francisco two weeks ago.
10068943	10069763	Sorry!
10070844	10071264	It was fun.
10072845	10076546	FU to JTap for being one of the most boring anime conventions I've ever attended.
10076586	10082308	My only complaint is that I didn't get to hang around with friends I haven't seen for a long time, even though I was staffing in the video department.
10082989	10083629	Wish I could have gone.
10084827	10086087	Something came up and I couldn't go.
10086147	10087008	I was originally planning.
10089108	10091789	Dark Knight says, My FU is one of extraordinary magnitude.
10091989	10095890	FU to the local putt-putt in my hometown for taking away the only 2DX machine in Richmond.
10096191	10098871	It's now the only Beatmania we have now as second mix complete.
10098951	10099392	Damn them.
10099532	10101512	Damn them all to Haiti.
10103773	10112676	Mandarin says, FU to dumb Costco customers who don't know how to put perishable shit back where it belongs, but instead put some frozen hamburger patties on the same aisle as aspirin.
10113156	10113376	Hahaha.
10117881	10122285	Shade23 says, F you to my headset for being missing so I can't defend in the groove.
10122346	10123587	Hey, I said good things about it.
10124348	10125589	I said bad things about it too.
10126490	10129893	Johnfield said, F you to spilling soda all over myself at dinner.
10130093	10131595	F you to not enough hours in the day.
10132115	10136780	F you for not being able to go to Tokyo Game Show and get PSM exclusive footage.
10138769	10141571	Sid says F you to Utah for being a Bomani wasteland.
10141671	10145134	F you to my hands for failing get on beat wild style every time that I play it.
10145274	10148276	F you to the samurai of the world for the suppression of the ninja clans.
10148997	10149738	Are they still around?
10149798	10150098	I don't know.
10150758	10153480	And F you to my body for waking me up at 5 a.m.
10153541	10154842	every day when I really need to get up at 7.
10154962	10161947	Siegert says F you to the whiny ass DDR freak people who complain that Extreme US is crappy because it doesn't cater their wants.
10162367	10162948	Get over it.
10163348	10166931	F you to those same people who blame Konami of America for EXUS's faults.
10167441	10169144	Try blaming the right company for once.
10169425	10169625	Oh!
10170207	10172812	F you to having Job ADD in Final Fantasy XI.
10172852	10176178	And finally, F you to the DS only coming out in the silver-black color.
10176599	10177822	I want some sort of blue.
10178262	10178743	Just wait.
10178884	10179485	Pokemon Blue.
10181502	10186786	Zaku says, F you to having to spend the better part of Friday cleaning out the shit called spyware, addaware from my computer.
10187226	10197653	F you to Fox News Live for basically making DDR Freak Mod Frequency look like a fool when she asked him that she thought she was going to interview a nine-year-old and making DDR look like a fad instead of a serious weight loss tool.
10197673	10198573	We're actually going to get to that.
10198593	10201395	We have like five minutes left in show, but I want to get to that.
10201515	10210321	Rychan says, F you to all the American brats acting like Festival was made for them so they have every right to bitch about the preliminary song list.
10210361	10211322	Another thing we didn't even get to.
10211875	10214977	F you to our arcade manager for not doing anything to take care of our machine.
10214997	10219460	F you to Konami Style for not making it easier to get a hold of the 2DX8 style limited edition.
10222002	10227525	Uh, DDArcoholic, uh, F you to my emerging pot belly.
10227926	10230888	F you to my old CD burner for deciding it doesn't want to burn discs anymore.
10230948	10233289	So I replaced your stupid head with a new DVD burner.
10233329	10233549	Yay.
10233890	10235611	Rob, your new icon has a penis in it.
10235671	10236251	No, it doesn't.
10236431	10237852	I did not put a penis in the icon.
10237872	10238953	You guys are just seeing things.
10239867	10245971	Oh, and F you to this insane beeping sound that keeps going off somewhere in my apartment complex every five minutes and has been doing so for several days now.
10246411	10252135	Maybe longer because I only just recently noticed it and now it's fucking annoying because it goes beep, beep, beep every five freaking minutes every day.
10252435	10252555	Ah.
10253435	10257958	Lastly, Nince says, F you to myself for picking a hard to find topic for my research paper.
10257978	10259319	F you to my boss.
10259659	10264342	She has this wonderful idea if someone only works for two or three days a week, no matter how many hours they work in those days,
10264755	10266836	She doesn't pay you that week and rolls it in the next week.
10267156	10268877	I'm going to school now and can't work that much.
10269398	10270618	I need my damn money now.
10271179	10274680	And F you to the creepy guy that was following my friends and I at the movie theater last night.
10274720	10278743	Later found out from her friend working there that he had been there for hours talking to random people.
10279503	10282585	And he says he should have that Echo Image Neverending Story remix in five minutes.
10282845	10284146	So pass that along to us.
10284226	10284806	We want it too.
10289609	10290089	All right.
10290409	10292070	We're done with the F yous.
10293633	10296255	One more kind of big story this week we've got to get to.
10298576	10304600	DDR made an appearance on Fair and Balanced, ha ha ha, Fox News this week.
10304920	10312285	And we actually got a picture, not a picture, I'm sorry, the clip of the interview here.
10312505	10313586	I actually haven't even watched this.
10313606	10317369	Well, I watched it when it was live on air, but I haven't even seen this other little clip of it yet.
10317969	10319010	It says it's 25 minutes.
10319050	10319610	I can't be right.
10320231	10320671	There we go.
10320711	10321291	That's more like it.
10321331	10322392	It's only about three minutes.
10322867	10323848	Alright, let's check this out.
10323908	10332332	Here is a little interview, and we're going to do, of course, in typical Orange Lounge fashion, we will butt in and make comments whenever we feel like it on the Fox News clip.
10332352	10335414	So here it is, the audio version for those of you guys who didn't get a chance to hear it.
10339376	10341977	Wow, and the audio level is very shitty.
10341997	10342897	Let me see what I can do about that.
10342937	10344498	Let me see if I can open it up in another program.
10344638	10345319	Give me a minute, you guys.
10345339	10345839	Sorry about that.
10346919	10349701	This is what happens when you try to play something when you haven't really...
10350191	10351112	Explore the file yet.
10351132	10352893	If worse comes to worse, we can always save it for next week.
10353633	10355995	Let's see what I can do about turning up the volume here.
10356115	10358456	Let's go into this.
10358596	10359457	Let's try it this way.
10361418	10364600	You can't hear it!
10366581	10367542	The audio sucks.
10369042	10369223	Ah!
10370363	10371044	The audio sucks.
10371104	10371884	It's an MPEG.
10373205	10375306	Okay, Loki's going to try blasting it for you guys.
10375526	10376227	It's on my desktop.
10376247	10377127	You should be able to share it, right?
10379269	10379829	Hold on, hold on.
10382008	10382908	Let me share the desktop.
10386109	10386729	Oh, shit.
10389650	10390950	Oh, can I copy it over to your network?
10391910	10393771	We're having technical difficulties, everybody.
10395791	10398032	Alright, I'm going to try putting it on Loki's computer.
10398052	10399072	We're going to try one other thing here.
10400152	10402013	This is what I get for trying to do things on the fly.
10402073	10403513	Alright, I'm going to drop it in right there.
10404714	10405274	Let's see that.
10407814	10408575	Alright, here we go.
10409075	10409715	Loki's got it.
10409755	10410375	We're going to try to
10412039	10412219	What?
10412239	10414100	Pause it, pause it, pause it.
10414120	10415702	Obviously they did their research there.
10415722	10417303	The member of the DDR Freaks.
10417343	10420625	Did you know that you're a moderator on DDR Freaks?
10420645	10422146	That woman is a moron.
10441946	10443066	Alright, start it up again.
10445127	10447948	Jason, first, why don't you explain to me what DDR is?
10449408	10457771	Well, Dance Dance Revolution is an interactive video game that combines physical activity with energetic dance music.
10458371	10466173	It allows you to actually drop your controllers and get up on a dance floor and actually move to the groove.
10466473	10469194	This is not that much different than Twister without the music, no?
10470675	10473717	Yeah, a lot of people have said it's like karaoke for your feet.
10474858	10475878	Pause it, pause it, pause it.
10475959	10478580	I don't know anyone that's ever called it karaoke for your feet.
10478620	10480341	Has anyone ever heard karaoke for your feet?
10480862	10482103	I've heard the twister thing.
10482523	10483544	I've heard Simon Says.
10483564	10484604	I've heard Spider Stomp.
10485505	10487366	I don't know, maybe I should ask Jason Enos.
10489067	10489808	Hey, you know what?
10489888	10491989	My preschool teacher, her name was Mrs. Enos.
10492309	10492970	So, you know what?
10493050	10494070	Respect a little bit here.
10494611	10494951	Pause it.
10496620	10503605	You are part of the DDR Freaks, and I just have to out you on your age, you're 21 years old, you're not a 6 year old 7 year old.
10503905	10504486	Pause it.
10505646	10509549	That was like the most belittling comment there, I have to out you on your age, you're not 6 or 7.
10510210	10517675	Cause I can't tell by the fact that this guy has facial hair, he's got a little goatee going on, he looks like he's a pretty well built guy.
10517715	10522178	He does look like, by looks alone here, he does appear to be past puberty.
10523931	10525733	Remember, the average person is an idiot.
10525773	10527294	They have to explain these things.
10546537	10548678	I'm five years older than this guy.
10549219	10550320	Jamie's older than this guy.
10550400	10551360	Matt's older than this guy.
10551440	10552501	Bradley's older than this guy.
10552541	10554983	I think almost everybody in this room, except maybe Jonas.
10555003	10555683	How old are you, Jonas?
10557024	10559365	Then everybody in this room except Jonas is older than this guy.
10560086	10562708	So when she kind of says that to him, I kind of get mad.
10562768	10564769	But of course this is Fox News and they're stupid anyway.
10564829	10567351	Anyway, I'm positive.
10567371	10568111	21, yeah.
10568151	10568691	You like this?
10569412	10570833	Yeah, you know what?
10570853	10571573	Pause it, pause it.
10571973	10573134	You like this crap.
10574495	10575796	So you actually like this.
10577421	10578521	You're so weird!
10578541	10580662	Unposit.
10580682	10583043	Who are 14 years old, and I know people who are 40 years old.
10583163	10585304	They're all playing the game, they all love the game.
10585504	10589206	For whatever reason, either it's exercise or even competition.
10589466	10593167	Yeah, so since this story has kind of a serious angle, we're talking about obesity and kids.
10593787	10595288	Tell me about the losing weight part.
10595328	10596929	Does it really make you work up the sweat?
10597349	10598109	Unposit.
10599430	10600290	No, you think?
10601278	10608382	I want to point out at this moment they're showing people dancing on the game wearing these kind of like aerobic looking things.
10609202	10611723	So, let me get this straight.
10612503	10613604	Let me get this straight, Don.
10615065	10618126	When I move, I'm going to work up a sweat?
10618306	10619107	Is that what you're telling me?
10621528	10621888	Unpause it.
10624480	10625320	It makes me work a sweat.
10625460	10633902	It's really, you know, songs can run you, you know, at a very slow pace or can even run you at a very high pace.
10635362	10640503	Songs can run up to 300 BPM and, you know, a regular song on the radio can only go to about maybe 120.
10640543	10645204	Okay, obviously they did not prep him with the questions there.
10645344	10651086	I mean, you know, no offense to that guy, but songs on the radio only go up to 130 BPM.
10651126	10652966	I don't know so much about that, but anyway...
10654166	10664052	It's obvious that they did not let him know what the questions would be in advance, so, you know, he's probably just... Because if it were to go over that, you know, just sheer chaos would erupt.
10664912	10665053	Ah!
10665373	10665953	Too fast!
10666053	10666733	Too fast!
10667014	10667594	Can't drive!
10667634	10668094	Too fast!
10670115	10674978	Just like nuclear bombs that go off, you know, just the world erupt into pure anarchy.
10674998	10676199	Yeah.
10676239	10676399	Yeah.
10677446	10678126	Alright, unpause it.
10678906	10679286	Pause it.
10679346	10683287	I would like to point out, lady, you can do anything for hours and hours.
10683567	10689669	You could play DDR, you could play EverQuest, you could masturbate for hours and hours if you wanted to.
10689909	10690549	You could, um...
10706343	10709487	Plot to murder Fox News reporters for hours and hours.
10709527	10709887	I'm kidding.
10710428	10711249	Unpause it.
10711289	10711910	Just one more song.
10711950	10713312	I'll be right there.
10713592	10717457	It gets your entire body into it.
10717477	10718839	You don't even pay attention to yourself.
10719299	10719720	Pause it.
10720020	10720361	Pause it.
10720661	10723084	Yeah, also they had to show your token Asian playing DDR there.
10723104	10723765	But I want to point out.
10724918	10726818	I love how she had to compare it to EverQuest.
10728099	10729019	Excuse me.
10730419	10735720	So, does this game get you addicted and then you want to murder people like EverQuest does?
10735780	10737840	Do you think that your friends are orcs?
10738140	10740301	I want to put my score on eBay and sell it.
10742601	10743521	Okay, now wait a minute.
10743541	10750262	That's not such a stretch because we all know that there are certain individuals that put their shoes on eBay and some idiot out there is dumb enough to buy it.
10752343	10753483	I don't know anyone who's done that.
10754467	10757150	Yeah, I could, well, yeah, we'll, anyway.
10757351	10757831	Unpause it.
10758252	10767361	You know, losing weight or having fun, you know, playing the game, just, you know, listening to music and... I might add that the terror alert was elevated at the time.
10768042	10768503	Shut up.
10769063	10771766	Hey, Jason, it sounds like you should be marketing this to adults.
10771806	10772787	How much does this game cost?
10772827	10773288	Pause it.
10773688	10774149	Pause it.
10777028	10778989	That is the funniest capture of him, by the way.
10780549	10782489	There are so many places you could go with this statement.
10782529	10784430	It sounds like a game you should be marketing towards adults.
10785630	10787391	And why are we all on the Fox News Channel right now?
10787411	10789591	Because I know so many children that watch the station.
10790872	10795373	And if you do know any children that watch Fox News Channel, they are being poisoned.
10795793	10796553	Turn them away.
10796653	10798053	Make them watch SpongeBob.
10798234	10798474	All right.
10802650	10805674	Pause it.
10806976	10807957	Totally great.
10808277	10811341	I love the fact that Jason just happened... Why?
10811601	10812943	It's so funny you should ask.
10813043	10815386	I just happen to have the game right here in my hand.
10816244	10817425	I'm so glad you asked!
10817445	10819827	See, obviously he was prepped on his questions, but that's alright.
10819947	10820227	Anyway.
10820247	10821648	Pause it.
10821668	10822008	Pause it.
10822169	10823770	In other words, I'm too cheap to buy one myself!
10844591	10846711	Give me one for free, Jason, please.
10846791	10848272	I think we need to write a letter to them.
10849452	10851312	Please don't report on DDR again.
10851772	10853133	Please don't report on anything.
10853333	10854853	Fox News Channel is a horrible station.
10854893	10856433	Anyway, I'll pause it.
10856473	10859074	Thank you so much, Jason, Enos, and Don.
10859414	10859914	Enos!
10860734	10861594	Enos!
10861974	10864275	Let me talk about pronunciation here.
10864635	10866055	Does it look like there's an I?
10866135	10867375	Does it look like there's an E?
10867535	10870076	It's a fucking O. Enos!
10870808	10874750	It would even be, if you mispronounce it, it would be like, you know, Pot or something.
10874770	10877371	It would be Enos, not Enis.
10878351	10880652	Enos, Enos, not Enis.
10881252	10883633	You might as well just call him Jason the Penis Man.
10883673	10886514	I mean, seriously, that's what you're... You're fucking stupid.
10887215	10888335	Learn to pronounce shit.
10891416	10894938	Well, thank you, Mr. Enos and the little six-year-old from DDR Freaks.
10895018	10895798	Thank you so much.
10897039	10897519	I'm positive.
10897742	10899344	Don D'Amato, thank you very much.
10900085	10900345	Greg?
10900525	10901346	Thank you, Derek.
10901406	10902207	Alright, wait, wait, wait.
10902928	10904630	That guy has such a porn star name, too.
10904950	10905190	What?
10905551	10906251	Don D'Amato.
10906311	10907833	That's kind of a porn star name, don't you think?
10909295	10909615	Alright.
10910656	10912959	Can you play the clip one more time?
10913579	10916723	Because I really quickly want to read for you guys the Fox Facts.
10917335	10918496	Dancing video game can help kids lose weight
10939133	10939914	or DDR.
10940314	10943616	Let's kids get their groove on and lose weight at the same time.
10944056	10951701	With us now, DDR product manager Jason Enos and Don D'Amato, member of a fan club called DDR Freaks.
10951861	10952661	Welcome both of you.
10953542	10956283	Still saying dancing video games can help kids lose weight.
10959007	10961688	Come on, get to the facts.
10961868	10962568	Oh, here we go.
10962968	10964568	Jason Enos, CDR project manager.
10964588	10967068	We all know that.
10968029	10973210	Enos has helped design numerous video games.
10974670	10975410	Imagine that.
10975630	10979471	He works for Konami and he has helped design numerous video games.
10979971	10980751	I never would have thought.
10980771	10982191	15% of American kids are overweight or obese.
10988936	10992658	Now that's a fact.
10993899	10999361	I'd like to add that Mel B was in this video.
11001222	11003263	I would be embarrassed to be on this station, but anyway.
11003283	11003483	Pause it.
11003503	11006285	Another 15% of kids are at risk of becoming overweight.
11006305	11007825	They are one Snickers bar away from doom.
11017631	11019332	Put that kid on Atkins right now!
11019572	11024394	Now the risk of them becoming overweight, is that meaning that they're at risk of the overweight person eating them?
11024694	11027036	So therefore they're becoming part of the overweight person?
11027996	11028336	Whatever.
11029017	11031898	Anyways, back to it.
11033239	11035680	Pause it, I can't resist.
11036040	11037861	Listen to how she's talking down to him.
11038821	11043924	So Dawn, you're part of the DDR freaks, and you're not nine years old?
11045143	11045783	Sorry, we've got to finish.
11045963	11046404	Unpause it.
11046464	11048925	Let's get the rest of the facts.
11050145	11053907	Over 9 million American kids are overweight or obese.
11054227	11056928	So they've taken that 15%, and now they've just... You know who's to blame for that?
11056988	11057689	Mommy and Daddy.
11057849	11058669	Yeah, I know, I know.
11058689	11059710	7-year-old.
11059810	11060870	I'm 21, yeah.
11060930	11061491	You like this.
11062171	11063511	Yeah, you know what?
11063571	11064412	I know people who are 40.
11065732	11070134	And then, of course, his name, Don D'Amato, porn star and DDR Freaks member.
11070975	11072756	And it says DDR Freaks member.
11072816	11073376	I love the game.
11074127	11077150	Domato has played Dance Dance Revolution for years.
11077730	11079272	For whatever reason.
11079752	11083896	Over 10% of children aged 2 to 5 are overweight.
11084696	11087499	Because you so should get your 2-year-old into DDR.
11087519	11091382	2-year-olds aren't... Yeah, those are the people that are fucking putting those stupid kids on the pads.
11091703	11093685	I want my fat bitch to get you.
11095166	11097007	Less fat and less bitchy.
11099471	11101732	Either it's exercise or even competition.
11101992	11107833	Yeah, so since this story has kind of a serious angle, we're talking about obesity and kids, tell me about the losing weight part.
11107853	11109454	Does it really make you work up a sweat?
11109874	11111314	It makes me work a sweat.
11111894	11114815	It's really, you know... Pause it.
11115435	11118996	Kids need 60 minutes of activity a day for their health.
11119176	11123137	So kids, start having sex early because you need 60 minutes of it every day.
11123157	11126498	It can run you, you know, at a very slow pace or...
11127600	11133103	approximately one half of kids do vigorous physical activity regularly.
11133584	11139727	Yes, I would like to readjust that number to about 99% of teenagers who masturbate frequently.
11140387	11141188	What arcade is that?
11141789	11142949	I have no idea what arcade it is.
11142969	11144470	Does it look familiar to you or something?
11144690	11146710	It could even run you at a very high pace.
11147911	11153152	Songs can run up to 300 BPM and, you know, a regular song on the radio can only go to about maybe 120.
11154092	11161254	So maybe songs can end up being about three times as fast and moving around three times as fast as any, you know, normal buddy.
11163195	11168316	Approximately one quarter of kids report no vigorous physical activity.
11170677	11171077	And the other...
11172372	11174133	And that quarter would be the liars.
11174253	11178515	No, I'm kidding.
11178795	11179635	Anyway.
11179935	11182477	That would be funny because if they muted out that it was about DDR.
11182777	11184518	So this is something you could do for hours and hours.
11184558	11185018	You can.
11185098	11185518	You can.
11186078	11186478	Oh, sorry.
11186979	11187959	A quarter of U.S.
11188039	11191901	kids spend four or more hours a day watching TV.
11193024	11199407	Could part of that four hours be watching TV to, you know, see the arrows that are going up the screen to play the game?
11200187	11200948	I didn't mean that.
11200968	11202428	Actually watching television programming.
11203129	11203449	Whatever.
11204662	11204982	No shit.
11205022	11206423	Pause it, pause it, pause it.
11206463	11208165	Can you sense it a little bit in his reaction?
11232364	11234186	Can you sense it just a little bit in his reaction?
11234226	11235707	He's just kind of like, no shit, lady.
11235727	11237970	What do you think I'm doing on your piece of shit television station?
11238030	11238570	I think so.
11239271	11240172	I see it a little bit.
11240552	11243555	I'm not going to say that's what he meant to say, but I sense it a little bit.
11244256	11252464	We just brought out our latest... The next time I see him, hopefully at E3 this year, I'm going to ask him, don't you think you should be marketing this game for adults?
11254046	11255187	See if he gets the joke.
11255635	11257215	Also give you a dollar for that.
11258256	11259056	I'll double that.
11259236	11261356	Dance Dance Revolution Extreme for the PlayStation 2.
11262076	11265837	Oh, the fast facts went away so that we can see the nice cover of CDR Extreme.
11265877	11269678	We also have a version that comes with the dance pad so you can get started right away for $59.99.
11271198	11271698	Oh, wow.
11271818	11275939	I'm going to have to ask our promo department if we've got... Same one, same tag.
11275999	11276899	That looks kind of good.
11276979	11280180	Thank you so much, Jason Enos and Don DiMato.
11280280	11281100	Thank you very much.
11281120	11281840	You're welcome.
11281860	11282100	Greg?
11282301	11282781	Thank you, Derek.
11288041	11289101	That's what we're here for.
11289742	11290082	Look at this.
11290122	11292362	Our longest show ever, thanks to that little clip.
11292382	11293163	I need to go home.
11293523	11293823	You know what?
11294083	11295864	It needed to be made fun of, though.
11295884	11296584	Oh, I know.
11296704	11305967	With all respect to Don and Jason for being good sports with that interview, we just had to... I'll take any chance I can to make fun of Fox News.
11307207	11309488	Anyway, let's move on with our final thoughts.
11309508	11311108	We've got to wrap up this show.
11311448	11312549	We'll start off with our guests.
11312669	11313349	Start off with Jonas.
11314969	11315970	Jason Enis.
11319581	11319862	Angel.
11323104	11323524	I don't know.
11323604	11325206	All I can think about is Final Fantasy XIV.
11325306	11325886	Please kill me.
11327327	11327567	Addict.
11328088	11330290	And Arcadian42.
11331611	11332471	Last week is a tip.
11332531	11333212	Yay.
11333332	11333852	Finally.
11335233	11335714	Yay.
11336194	11338636	My thought is we didn't even get through all of this week's news.
11338656	11339797	That's how crazy of a week it was.
11339817	11343780	Why is it that the Monty News always is like all of a sudden it's all in one week?
11343840	11345161	We'll just have to carry it over to next week.
11345341	11345701	We'll see.
11346362	11348043	And tune into our other shows too, please.
11348123	11348343	Thanks.
11348644	11348844	Loki.
11350302	11356566	And in this corner, weighing 250 pounds, the raging fury, Enos the Penis!
11361029	11362510	DarkSakura, your final thought?
11363150	11364611	My intestines hurt.
11365372	11366132	Damn carbs.
11367633	11369875	Alright, and, uh... Oh, I have one more thing.
11369975	11370175	What?
11370495	11373137	The only person you have to blame is yourself.
11374298	11374558	Okay.
11374918	11377159	We're all going to do the final word together today.
11377179	11378560	I'm going to say it once for everybody.
11378580	11379601	You should see this coming.
11381124	11382125	Alright, here it is.
11382185	11383485	Here's tonight's final word.
11383525	11383806	Ready?
11384486	11386847	Wait, I gotta get it queued up so we got the music ready to go here.
11386867	11387068	Ready?
11388789	11392951	One, two, three, Enos!
11394592	11399455	That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

11423437	11425238	So dangerous, so dangerous.
11425838	11429680	He fights the law, but he also fights the crime, but not as much.
11430000	11430721	Dangerousque.

11508664	11512172	Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
11529289	11532231	Orange Lounge Radio, the afterbirth, the part after the credits.
11532291	11537293	Of course, we've already given you an extra bonus ten minutes tonight, so you should be thankful for that.
11537333	11538014	I'm going home.
11538114	11539414	I know, you've got to get home, Jamie.
11540115	11540955	Jonas is leaving.
11540975	11542896	I have to do my quiz for database management.
11542956	11546058	Our listeners are all leaving too, so it's going to be short.
11547518	11564240	I definitely want to play this for you guys, because I just got it, and we've been talking about it a little bit before earlier, so you know I've got to play this for you guys now that we've got it, thank you Ninst for passing this along, but we did manage to get that echo image, never ending story, what is this?
11564778	11568201	The NeverEnding Story Fantasy Remix, or what is that?
11568221	11568741	Fantasia.
11568761	11569642	Fantasia Mix.
11570022	11572764	So we don't know if this is the actual NeverEnding Story theme song.
11572824	11575446	Okay, but it has NeverEnding Story and Fantasia.
11575466	11578188	I mean, that's kind of not really a... And it's Echo Image.
11578208	11579729	How can you go wrong with this, no matter what it is?
11580610	11581150	So let's hear it.
11581450	11581891	Let's hear it.
11582091	11582411	Let's see.
11603081	11604302	You know, I'm just a child.
11604342	11604642	I'm sorry.
11604662	11605202	I knew everything.
11605262	11605662	I'm so sorry.
11605723	11606503	I can't forgive you.
11606563	11607063	I just can't wait.
11650686	11656849	Look at what you see in the face, the mirror of your dreams.
11656869	11659631	Believe I'm a hero, hidden in the light, written on the pages.
11707685	11710329	One keep the secret We'll fall behind the clouds They are among the rainbows
11853153	11859019	Echo Image there, who we've all fallen in love with recently with a kick-ass version of Never Ending Story.
11859079	11859319	Wow.
11859719	11863643	As I told Sigurd in private message, we've been having a little bit of a private message chat going back and forth.
11863944	11865045	I want to have sex with that song.
11866913	11867454	Downright.
11867474	11869855	That song is everything that I imagined it would be.
11870415	11871416	That was so hot.
11871776	11872797	It's so unbelievably hot.
11872897	11873337	I loved it.
11873717	11875338	Which is why I had to download... God damn it.
11875378	11877219	Why couldn't you have put that in Cage Match?
11877319	11880321	As much as I love Come Back, that would have been a much better song.
11880661	11881181	I know.
11881562	11883283	I did download... What did I get earlier?
11883323	11885404	I need to get that off your computer too, that song.
11886024	11890507	I did download the Icon of Coil remix of Skull.
11890527	11891327	Play like a little bit of that.
11891467	11892348	The Icon of Coil?
11892648	11894349	Coil, it's another... Play like a little clip.
11894489	11894969	Go in the middle.
11898091	11899331	Kill our speakers there, why don't you?
11899351	11900352	I forgot I turned it up for that.
11900452	11901292	Way to go, genius.
11921107	11922888	They're an industrial band, by the way.
11923348	11923728	Wow.
11924909	11925469	All right, stop it.
11925830	11926110	Wow.
11927050	11931253	I swear to God, I'm going to start like an Echo Image fan site on orisonradio.com.
11931493	11933554	I just, God, they are so good.
11934294	11936956	Note said, and I just noticed this.
11937136	11939437	Now, I don't know about this because I was looking at their discography.
11939857	11940838	They only have one album.
11941278	11941658	I know.
11942178	11943139	It's because people don't know it.
11943859	11944099	One album.
11944119	11945160	I'm spreading the word.
11946041	11947241	Don't download this shit.
11947321	11948622	Go buy the album.
11948662	11949522	You won't regret it.
11949723	11950523	I swear you won't.
11952256	11955898	And as soon as I can find a copy of the album, I'm going to buy it legitimately too, I swear.
11955958	11956838	I'm going to order it on Amazon.
11956898	11963601	I hope to God that what they really need to do, and I'm really saying what they need to do, is they need to gather all these artists on this label here.
11964201	11965642	I forget what it's called now.
11965902	11968263	But anyways, gather all the artists, throw a concert.
11968523	11970884	Just even like two cities or something.
11971285	11975727	I know it's expensive to throw a concert, but these are artists that no one's ever heard of.
11976127	11979408	Maybe get the label to come and chip in a little bit of money.
11979488	11980669	Or even just one concert.
11980729	11980949	I mean...
