Now he's Kitchen Man too.

33
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,240

Yeah, and I'm here.

35
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,240
Oh, you sound a little drained after last week.

00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,240
Anyway.

48
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,180
No, you're just Angel for short now.

49
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,880
Oh, damn it. Fine. I guess I'm-

50
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,180
DR Angel USA. That's your new name now.

51
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,680
Shit.

52
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,380
Well, at least you didn't put tics, Angel, pop music, Angel, whatever.

53
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:27,380
You got the shitty mic. Just to warn you, you gotta hold it at the bottom when you talk in it.

54
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:27,880
Just careful.

55
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,680
I got the shitty mic right now.

56
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,680
You go, girl.

57
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,080
Yeah.

58
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,180
Alright.

59
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,180
Hahahaha.

60
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,680
Hahahaha. Anyway.

61
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,680
Did they even get what I said or no?

62
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,580
Yeah, they heard most of it.

63
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,380
They heard-

64
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,580
Yeah.

65
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,580
And, uh, no. I'm not gonna go there.

66
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,580
Yeah, okay.

67
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,580
Alright, uh...

68
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,580
Stop sending them hurricanes.

69
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,580
Um, yeah, really.

70
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:55,580
Uh, we got a really big show tonight, and I'm very disappointed.

71
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:59,580
We only have about, like, half our usual listeners tuned in right now. Shame on you!

72
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,580
You're watching football.

73
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:04,580
That's after, you know, I did the show last week, you know.

74
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:07,580
Yeah, they were all scared off from the Loki experience last week.

75
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:13,580
Tune in, it's a big show tonight. We got DDR Extreme USA Music for you all night long.

76
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:21,580
We've got my review of In The Groove. Yes, I actually got to play it, and so now I'm no longer talking out of my ass.

77
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,580
I know what I'm talking about with this show now, or with this game.

78
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,580
Can you tell us all how much it sucks?

79
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:30,580
Well, we'll see. Maybe I didn't think it sucks. We'll see. I don't know.

80
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:36,380
We also, of course, have our review of DDR Extreme coming up, and the Skype line will

81
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:39,740
be open, of course, all night long, and a whole lot of other Bomani news.

82
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,180
It's just been a busy week.

83
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:45,100
God, we might have to actually stay on topic tonight.

84
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,100
No.

85
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:49,540
You're right, but first we're going to do How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day when we

86
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:55,140
get back from this break, featuring licensed music from DDR Extreme USA, including what

87
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,980
I believe would be Jamie's favorite licensed song.

88
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,980
Ooh.

89
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:03,980
It's an old 80s song by a British lady. She's a little wild.

90
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:08,460
all right here it is enjoy it we'll be back

91
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:38,980
I search for the beat in this steady jail

92
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,980
Down town, the young ones are going

93
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:44,980
Down town, the young ones are going

94
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,980
We're the kids in America

95
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,980
We're the kids in America

96
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:55,980
Everybody live for the music around

97
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:26,580
Where the camp, where the camp, where the camp out of Africa

98
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:31,880
Where the camp, where the camp, where the camp out of Africa

99
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:38,980
Where the camp, where the camp, where the camp out of Africa

100
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:57,420

Can't stop, can't stop the beat, I won't stop, won't stop the beat to go

108
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:46,020

Some little toy, some little toy, it's comin' gettin'

00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,020
So little time, so little time

112

Here I come now

113
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:27,020
So little hope, so little hope

114
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,020
And I'm praying out for love

115
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,020
Yeah

116
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:34,020
I should never find the maze we chase

117
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,020
A nice little way

118
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:38,020
A thousand years, a thousand days

119
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,020
So manipulate

120
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,020
So manipulate in the dark

121
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:43,020
And I'm praying out for love

122
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,020
Love

123
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,020
Praying for love

124
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,020
Love, love, love

125
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,020
Simply be loved

126
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:43,940
Simply be loved, it's more than enough

127
00:10:43,940 --> 00:11:05,740
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because Real Radio makes Captain Jack cry.

128
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:12,620
We are back with Orange Lounge Radio, and of course tonight, big news, lots of news

129
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:16,500
in the video game world this week. There was a game that came out that we have all finally

130
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:20,960
been looking forward to, and thusly, we're going to dedicate tonight's entire show to

131
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:24,460
this game. Hooray for Final Fantasy XI Chains of Promathia.

132
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:31,460
No bullshit! It's Sims 2! No way. I like both of those. I need the Sims 2. I need to kill

133
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:41,020
them in more original ways and better graphics. A certain former intern of ours has my copies

134
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,020
and claims to have lost them.

135
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:43,980
I'm downloading mine.

136
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,900
You know, the interesting thing about Sims 2,

137
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,580
somebody, one of my buddies out there,

138
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,820
and I'm not going to say who it is,

139
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:56,840
because I don't want to embarrass them,

140
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,220
but they were sending me pictures

141
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:03,740
that they took inside Sims 2 of them living out their fantasy

142
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,980
with another certain individual.

143
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,260
I just thought it was hilarious.

144
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,100
I think it's great that you can kind of just

145
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:15,340
a way into the imaginary world of Sims 2 where you can live out your sexual fantasies.

146
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:26,060
I am going to kill the Olsen twins in a pool. That's going to be awesome. I can't wait.

147
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:31,380
I want to build like the house of all pool so I can like take all the people I hate and

148
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,380
have them drown there.

149
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:36,780
Alright, Seegert's posting in the chat room that it was him so I can say it was Seegert.

150
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:40,620
Sigurd sent me all these pictures of him living out his fantasy.

151
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:43,820
Anyway, you can, uh, what's great is, I like saw a

152
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:47,260
data review on something awful dot com about it, and apparently there's like

153
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,900
three different cities you can star in. One's like completely medieval, and

154
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,860
there's like some other strange one, and some other things.

155
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:56,380
But what's cool though is you can make like three and four story tall

156
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:59,820
buildings and stuff in this. Can you push people off?

157
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:04,860
I don't know, but he had really, really creepy fuzzy chairs,

158
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:08,360
He kept all of the dead up in his, like, roof.

159
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:12,860
My question is if the Rosebud code still works.

160
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:16,360
Oh, from the old-ass SimCity?

161
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,860
Good question. I have a question. You know how they had, like, a Sims that came out a while ago?

162
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:24,160
It was, like, the Sims Herbs? Like, it was the urban version of the Sims?

163
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,360
It came out not that long ago. I want to know if you have drive-bys in that game. That would be awesome.

164
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,360
That would be awesome.

165
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,360
That's, uh, San Andreas.

166
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:40,520
different game they need Grand Theft Sims that's what we need and then yes I

167
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:44,600
but we do we do have to tip our hat Jamie doesn't have to tip her hat but

168
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,800
Matt and I have to tip our hats to Final Fantasy 11 Chains of Prometheus

169
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,240
because you know we've been waiting for that addict for a while have had the

170
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:56,360
game now for almost 48 hours or like least 24 hours and have not been to any

171
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,240
of the new areas that's the beautiful part we've had the game for a day and a

172
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:07,240
half and it's been installed and I have yet to see any differences except one new song.

173
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:14,080
Beautiful waste of $30. You know what, dear dear addicts? Yes? I'm still playing Ragnarok

174
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:21,120
Online for free! Zelda Online, they do have- I've looked at that and it looks dinky. It's

175
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:28,120
so cool! I could go play the Satellaview Zelda on my computer and I have to deal with people.

176
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,980
Whatever.

177
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:33,280
Anyway, we're getting off subject. We have to go back to our roots and we have to do

178
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,260
what this show is all about

179
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:38,500
in the beginnings of the first chapter.

180
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,980
No, not that. Not that yet.

181
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:40,820
But, uh...

182
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,900
Oh, oh, it's cool.

183
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,620
The Athens game. I know.

184
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,720
No, no. How was your week? How was your day?

185
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,140
The greatest game of all time.

186
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,260
Oh. Okay.

187
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,500
Jamie, how was your week? How was your day?

188
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,460
Last week.

189
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:55,640
Not this, like, very past, but the week before.

190
00:14:55,640 --> 00:15:00,440
I was... Sorry, how was your two weeks? How was your day? I was a wreck.

191
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,220
Because the hurricane hit Mobile, Alabama.

192
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,920
Guess where I'm from?

193
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,560
Uh, I'll take Mobile for $200. Not from Kansas.

194
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,780
Anymore.

195
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:13,680
As if I ever was. Anyway, um...

196
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,900
Yeah, I was up that Wednesday night just watching the news.

197
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:20,000
Because they had a live feed from one of the local stations in Mobile. So I was

198
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,940
watching

199
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,680
the news until 3 a.m. Ooh!

200
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,720
And then the next day I didn't hear anything from my family so I was all a wreck and my

201
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,020
boss let me go home to get my phone list to call my uncle.

202
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,020
Turned out everyone's just fine.

203
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:35,180
He had a generator so he's like got power and everything and they're watching TV with

204
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:38,760
air conditioning and everyone else is like, we're hot.

205
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:43,640
You need to tell you not to open your windows and doors during a hurricane because it will

206
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,900
get the wind inside and blow out all the rest of your windows.

207
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,900
The pressure, yeah.

208
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:55,860
But luckily, when the North Eyewall was going to hit Mobile Bay, and they were expecting

209
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:59,180
it to surge all the water up through the bay and flood all of downtown, you know, hence

210
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:04,820
Water Street, but instead it sucked out all the water, so it kind of stunk there for a

211
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,500
little bit, but there wasn't any extraneous flooding.

212
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:12,900
It blew over a bunch of stuff, not down some trees, but there were no casualties in Mobile,

213
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:16,180
and there were no serious injuries reported.

214
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:20,280
However, tornadoes decided to drop down in the town I was born in, in Dothan, Alabama.

215
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:20,780
Dope.

216
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,780
Tore up a bunch of trailer parks.

217
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,780
And nearly hit my granny's house.

218
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,280
Ugh.

219
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,780
If this all dealt like a block from our house.

220
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:28,580
But it missed her?

221
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,080
It missed her.

222
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,580
That's good.

223
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,580
You're the hit movie gallery.

224
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,580
You're the hit movie gallery.

225
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:36,580
Their headquarters happens to be in Dothan, Alabama, and I fuckin' hate them.

226
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:42,780
Dude, I used to go to, like, one of the movie galleries out there that were, like, the crappiest place in the world.

227
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:49,780
They are the crappiest place. They buy out mom and pop stores, they replace all the employees with retards, and then they just, like, run the business.

228
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:52,780
So, so, you're missing movies, right?

229
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:55,780
Yeah, well, we've only checked the first box so far.

230
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,780
Well, why don't you check the second box? Maybe that's where your movies are.

231
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,780
Oh, yeah.

232
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:08,780
On a serious note before Jamie gets back to her, uh, story, just, you know, we hope that, uh, all you guys are safe from, uh, Ivan, and we hope, uh, everything's alright with you guys, our thoughts are with you guys.

233
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:18,780
And if you're in Florida right now, run! Run away! There's a hurricane coming! Pick up your Playstation and run!

234
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:22,780
No, seriously, we hope everything's alright with you guys.

235
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:27,780
This has just been sort of, I mean, it hasn't ever happened like this before.

236
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,780
Unless your last name is Bush, then by all means, stay.

237
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:48,780
Okay. You know what? At this point, though, after having a whole week filled with listening, with, you know, seeing the debates between those two particular presidential candidates, and by the way, people, more than two people are running for the presidency! Hello! There are other parties to choose from.

238
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,780
That'll never...

239
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:51,780
That's because people are so stupid.

240
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,780
For years and years, I know.

241
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:56,780
It's more like jogging, or brisk walking.

242
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,780
What?

243
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:06,460
It's like Coke and Pepsi. You can drink other sodas. Hello. Shasta and Fanta and Bosco.

244
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:11,980
Those are good. You could drink root beer. You don't have to drink Sprite or Coke.

245
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:21,420
But anyway, yeah. So, uh, I've just decided that neither candidate is worth my precious vote,

246
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:27,580
so I want them both to burn in hell. I'm voting for Billie Cat. Oh hell yeah, I'm voting for

247
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:32,500
bill the cat although something that was in I've actually put a link up in my

248
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:36,580
live journal a couple days ago apparently there's a couple other

249
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:40,460
candidates but I'll mention that later that I would be considered voting for

250
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:47,500
all right I might vote for the gay penguin but now I'm uh I'm voting for

251
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:51,900
bill the cat in Opus radical metal party like I always do because there's never

252
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:56,020
been anybody worth voting for I have to remember to turn in my registration form

253
00:18:56,020 --> 00:19:02,020
I have to mail it back. I know, shame on me, because I've moved. So, anyway.

254
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:09,020
I otherwise went to school, yay. Did homework, yay. We got slow at work, finally.

255
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:11,020
So I've been writing fanfiction at work.

256
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,020
Productive.

257
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:16,020
Because I'm bored. I don't know, I've been doing other stuff too.

258
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:23,020
And today Dan and I had a very interesting conversation about that supposed draft coming up for vote.

259
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:28,140
about, first of all, I don't think that anyone needs to worry about it

260
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:32,480
because how many years have they tried to bring it back and not enacted it?

261
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,720
But even so, I mean, where it's not good for the, you know,

262
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,700
the forward-thinking, you know, general

263
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:45,100
middle-class people. It would be a really good thing though for

264
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,460
you know, for all of the people who are out there

265
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:51,900
like, you know, welfare kids and

266
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:56,060
People who don't apply themselves and all those people who are you know?

267
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:01,440
26 years old living with mom and dad off of their money and not you know taking you know

268
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:05,220
Responsibility for their own lives be a good thing. You know what's nice though is that

269
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:11,900
Since as a gay male. I won't be drafted because I'm not allowed in the military so you know sorry

270
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,860
Not to go in the military

271
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:19,580
There's gonna be I I'm just saying they do bring back the draft

272
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:23,980
there's gonna be a it's it's gonna be the new fad instead of moving to Canada

273
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:27,700
everybody's gonna start sucking dick I mean that's gonna be like there's gonna

274
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:33,140
be this big huge inconsistency that's gonna have to be addressed at some point

275
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:37,380
I don't think it's gonna be overall it's gonna be good for a good for the

276
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:40,700
military itself you know to have a bunch of people there who they're not gonna

277
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:44,740
have time and resources to train properly and who aren't gonna really

278
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:49,560
want to be there yeah but on the other hand you know for especially for larger

279
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:56,600
cities that are dealing with, you know, high crime, you know, high, uh, well, I'm

280
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:01,440
trying to, I right now just lost the word I was thinking of, but overall, I think

281
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:07,000
that it would be, it could improve things on a social scale, but there's so many

282
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,800
drawbacks to it. Otherwise, I don't know that I'd be able to support anything

283
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:15,000
like it, but my fiance is all for it. So I told them they should have made it 30

284
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:21,600
so I could go. I'd freaking volunteer I don't care except you know we've got

285
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,240
that little issue with me and him right now about it so I'm working on it.

286
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:30,680
We'll see what happens. I'm working on it. Anything else you wanna share? No except

287

291
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:56,280
Loki how was your week how was your day my week was good up till about Friday

292
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:02,520
that's what my toe got cut into by the doctor to fix my ingrown toenail the

293
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,880
evil doctor no he was an evil doctor really took a couple minutes there it's

294
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:11,540
like a bitch he wasn't even moderately evil maybe he talked about what was he

295
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:15,720
he was rambling on about something of like mad cow disease buzz and deer so

296
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,780
I guess mad deer disease I don't know what the hell anyway this is something

297
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:25,020
like something to keep me focused on something other than you know them

298
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:31,940
poking my foot with needles out anyway and yeah so that hurts I've been

299
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:35,900
hobbling around for days and I just today I ripped the bandage off because

300
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:41,180
I'm supposed to. Apparently I forgot a process of the bandage ripping off where

301
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:46,040
I'm supposed to suck my toe in cold water and a little bit of hydrogen

302
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:52,160
peroxide to loosen the the impacted bandages in there. Well I forgot about

303
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:57,200
that so I just kind of pulled and with the pulling came the yanking and then

304
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:03,440
came the bleeding and that came the hurting so that really stuck and so then

305
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:09,200
there's that and then earlier this week I got DDR extreme I did a show people

306
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:16,000
got bored so I stopped the show and then I did a show last Sunday and people got

307
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
bored and we did a segment called crank call orange on his radio and I hung up

308
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,800
on someone and that was funny and then what else oh yeah and then let's see you

309
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:31,940
got changed to Promethea, didn't really do anything, leveled some characters, and played

310
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:36,200
a lot of Final Fantasy because I couldn't really go out and be active. Oh, and got a

311
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:43,200
book about my device. The, um, Skoal Experiment is what the book is called, and read it, and

312
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,560
apparently my device may be a little bit harder to get working than I thought, but that's

313
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:57,520
it's okay. I can still do it. And that's it. Oh, and I broke the lamp on Wednesday. That

314
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:07,000
was funny. Alright. Angel, how was your week? How was your day? Pretty good. Worked a lot

315
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,720
and, you know, did what I was supposed to do. Went to school. School was okay. School

316
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:19,680
was well school and I actually got some good news from my folks actually I

317
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:29,520
called them on oh was it Monday or Tuesday I think and I had asked them if

318
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:34,080
they had gotten hold of my brother and my sister-in-law and the baby and

319
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:40,120
everything and well it turns out they're okay so that was like a pressure off my

320
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:44,080
shoulders that you wouldn't believe except for you Jamie because you know

321
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:49,920
your family and everything so yeah that was just I was just so thankful that you

322
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:56,240
know the kid was okay and their family is okay and yeah so that was that was

323
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,800
just the highlight of the week pretty much oh yeah and extreme and Andrews

324
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:05,640
command mission oh boy Megaman more Megaman yay oh wait if he was listening

325
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:09,840
oh wait he's not listening haha I'm safe see I wanted to see you know I was

326
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:29,840
I was waiting for, you know, a goddamn title match between Mike Tyson versus, you know, Hurricane Ivan, because I think that would be really sweet, and they could totally set that kind of stuff up. So, you know, and Tyson's not doing anything. He's just being bankrupt. So, they could do it.

327
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:58,840
Yeah, and, um, I'm probably going to get Final Fantasy XI this week, I guess, and become the, um, I don't know, I'll probably be sucked up into it and stuff, maybe, or I'll just go back to there, or Agnarok, or, God, I could just go anywhere, couldn't I? Oh, well, whatever. Anyway, if anybody wants to know about there, go to there.com. Yeah, okay, that's my little spiel, goodbye.

328
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,840
Thank you. Bradley, do you have a mic over there? Oh, goodie. Bradley, how was your week? How was your day?

329
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:18,840
Yes, I do. Alright, this week was work, of course. Wednesday, I came over here and did the... played some DDR USA Extreme, or whatever it's called. Extreme USA. I wasn't particularly impressed, but it was alright.

330
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:27,840
Then, actually I think that was the first time I played DDR in months.

331
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,840
Let's see, then Saturday didn't do very much.

332
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:37,840
Got the thing about the initiatives for the state ballot in November,

333
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:42,840
and got to see the two that I did the Tim job with,

334
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:47,840
because one of my Tim jobs during November, I'm November,

335
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:54,360
April, March and April was basically checking petitions for the stem cell one and the lawsuit

336
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,360
one.

337
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,360
Let's see.

338
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:01,480
Oh, there's what I was working on, which was interesting.

339
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:12,600
And then Thursday or Friday, I had a bunch of old, like, Best Buy gifts to get someone

340
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:20,920
and got the Aqua Teen Hunger Forest DVD's and watched that most of the time.

341
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:21,920
Cool.

342
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,920
Those are fun.

343
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:27,160
So they did very much and came here and that's all.

344
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,160
Alright.

345
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,400
My week and my day, actually my past two weeks because I wasn't here on Sunday because I

346
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,400
was on a business trip.

347
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,600
I was in the lovely town of Allentown, Pennsylvania which is about an hour north of Philly, about

348
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:40,840
an hour west of Jersey.

349
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,680
You know, just kinda did my thing there.

350
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,120
I didn't get to play a whole lot of DDR,

351
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:45,880
I was actually thinking I was

352
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,600
gonna get to go out and play more DDR,

353
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,960
but I was still working a lot this time around,

354
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,580
and it was kinda one of those things

355
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,400
where when I was done working at the end of the day

356
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,680
I didn't really wanna go out,

357
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,180
I just wanted to go back to my hotel

358
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:58,360
and watch TV and sleep so I didn't really do a whole lot.

359
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,760
But I did go out one night to a little mall

360
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,360
out there in the area, which did have a DDR machine.

361
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,920
I was actually going to Walden Books there in the mall

362
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,200
cause I wanted to pick up some books.

363
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,000
But they happen to have a DDR machine and you know me,

364
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,860
I can't pass it up.

365
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:13,780
this actually was a Namco arcade I believe because they had pac-man stuff

366
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:18,940
all over I can't remember the name at time something I don't know what the

367
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:23,420
hell it was called but it was some Namco arcade there in the mall and I played a

368
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:29,140
game of DDR some pretty decent some pretty decent players were there you

369
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:33,780
know which is always exciting to see in a new area and I did really good on my

370
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:37,020
first set like a double-eight every song on my first set which for me who doesn't

371
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:42,020
doesn't play a whole lot anymore, is still like really good. And it even impressed this

372
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:45,120
one girl and she just started randomly talking to me and she's like, are you freaked out

373
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,500
by strangers talking to you? I'm like, not really, huh? I'm kind of lonely and sad because

374
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:55,020
I'm by myself in a strange town. But she talked to me a little bit and that was cool. And

375
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:58,740
I didn't plug the show though, I didn't want to, oh you shouldn't listen to my radio show.

376
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:05,780
But I didn't, I know, bad me. But then, okay, but then maybe I was just being an egotist

377
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:09,000
or something but I was looking at the scoreboards on the machine and the pop

378
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:14,440
for difficult scores were kind of eh like I was like I could get that you

379
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:17,660
know like and so I really wanted to do it and not I'm usually not a scoreboard

380
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:21,820
whore but how cool would it have been to have my name on a machine like thousands

381
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:25,420
of miles away right so I had to do it so I put my coins in I started to do it and

382
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:29,460
then the fucking pad like wouldn't work like it was just totally not registering

383
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:34,300
like half my steps I fucking failed on what irresistible month like standard I

384
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:42,060
I failed that. Oh well. What can you do? So much for that, trying to get my name on the

385
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:46,740
scoreboard at the Lehigh Valley Mall, but whatever. It's alright, it's alright, it's

386
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:52,420
just, you know, let that guy have it. It's cool. And over the weekend I actually got

387
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:55,860
to take a little bit of a tour of the East Coast a little more. My friend came and picked

388
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:59,780
me up and we drove through New York City a little bit. I didn't really stop to play DDR

389
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:05,300
were until we were on the way back and I knew that there was an in the groove machine in

390
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:09,600
Jersey and I thought well you know we talk about it a lot on the show and we've said

391
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,980
a lot of judgments about it but none of us have actually played it so I'm like I better

392
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:18,580
go play it so therefore I can give a fair review of the game and actually say well I've

393
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:22,580
played it so that you know you can't say I'm just talking to my ass so I will tell you

394
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:27,060
what I thought about that a little later but it was at this place called Eight on the Break

395
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:30,880
That was it, which I actually for some reason by the sound of it made me think it was like

396
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,160
some kind of boardwalk place.

397
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:36,580
I have no idea why I thought that because it's not even near an ocean at all.

398
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:41,000
It was interesting because there was this street fair going on the day we went, and

399
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,420
it was so random because the girl I was with, my friend Amanda and I, had no idea where

400
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,420
we were going.

401
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:50,360
We were just walking around trying to find this place, and suddenly here I am thousands

402
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:54,900
of miles away on a Sunday in the middle of some street fair in little town America.

403
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:59,220
this is really odd surreal for me but then we found a place we went in and I

404
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:02,620
was actually surprised there was quite a lot of Bemani at this place not only had

405
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:09,140
in the groove but they had a 2DX machine and a Para Para machine and DDR and just

406
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:13,460
a lot of stuff so I was pretty impressed I was kind of surprised they had all

407
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:18,220
that granted not all the machines were in tip-top shape but you know hey it uh

408
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:22,420
it actually ran on quarters which always impresses me because I don't like tokens

409
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:25,160
much because I always leave with extra tokens and the machines actually took

410
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:29,740
quarters so that was good and seemed to be some okay crowds I didn't really talk

411
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:33,720
to too many people I was kind of just a loner and but that's alright I wasn't

412
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,840
there to make a make a show so I just kind of went in played a few games and

413
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:42,160
left and that was my weekend pretty much and I've just kind of spent my time here

414
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:45,340
since I got back home just trying to catch up because when you leave town for

415
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:49,120
two weeks it's really hard to catch up so I have to go back to work tomorrow

416
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:59,120
Anyway, that's pretty much it for me for How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day, so anything else anybody wants to add?

417
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:14,120
I watched Rad today, and might I add, I only remembered one scene of that movie, and that's what got me the bite, is where the guy was riding on the fence.

418
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:29,120
And I actually watched the movie today and that was for like half a second, but for some reason in my mind that stood out, that and the backflip and the hell race, but my god that movie is so cheesy and awesome and just, it's awesome.

419
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:33,120
It's just pure 80's goodness and I watched the whole thing. It made me happy.

420
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,120
Go ahead.

421
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:44,400
last saw that movie and huh yes I would like to I last saw that in Albany

422
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:51,640
Georgia when I was a 10 I think that's the last time I've seen a movie and it's

423
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:56,880
very scary that I remember where I was yeah what I need to see monster squad

424
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:03,600
too but now I was in my I was at my my uncle Wayne's house with my cousins and

425
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:09,040
we were watching this movie and then it was over and we watched it again cuz at

426
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:12,200
the time that was like our favorite movie and my cousin had one of those

427
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:16,360
stunt bikes and was in this backyard trying to do all the stunts and

428
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:21,920
everything it was kind of kind of cool I got asked a question in the chat room

429
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:26,600
www.orangeandre.com click on Chad said wanted to know how Jay and silent Bob

430
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,760
secret stash was because I completely forgot to mention that was one other

00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,840
thing we did while we were in Jersey's we went to Red Bank New Jersey to go to

432
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:37,040
to Jay and Silent Bob Secret Stash which was very cool it was just you know your

433
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:40,560
typical kind of comic book store but it had a lot of memorabilia from the movies

434
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,920
which I thought was really cool I actually bought Loki's birthday present

435
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:47,360
there I bought him a comic book called Loki from the store and I got him a

436
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:52,080
shirt and the shirt says shit on it so that's kind of cool and then I picked up

437
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,400
some stickers and stuff too like I got Jamie a bear is driving sticker so

438
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:59,920

00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:03,760
poster which we're gonna hang up at some point tonight. It'll be on the wall that

440
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:07,200
you can see on the camera. I got a new poster from Jay and Silent Bob Secret Stash

441
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,200
and it's the one where Jay and Silent Bob has a whole little monologue on it

442
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:15,180
where Jay and Silent Bob are talking on the Ain't It Cool News

443
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:18,640
style site and they're talking about the movie they say you are the ones who are

444
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:23,000

I say hey, hey, hey What you got to say, what you got to say

482
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:59,440
I said 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

483
00:39:55,160 --> 00:40:14,580
this song is,

484
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:24,580
It would be a much better fight, with you, with me

485
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:34,580
If you hadn't met me, I'd be fine on my own, baby

486
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:40,580
With you, with me, if you hadn't met me

487
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:44,580
I'd be fine on my own, baby

488
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:49,580
Never felt so lonely then you came along

489
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:53,580
So now what should I do?

490
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:56,580
I'm strung out, addicted to you

491
00:40:56,580 --> 00:41:00,580
My body aches, now that you're gone

492
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:05,580
My supplies fell through

493
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:10,580
And they gave me everything you had and more

494
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:12,580
You craved my happiness

495
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:15,580
When you made me feel joy and made you smile

496
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:19,580
But now I feel your stress

497
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:23,580
Love was never meant to be such a crazy affair, no

498
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:26,580
And who has time for tears?

499
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:31,580
Never thought I'd sit around and unravel your love

500
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:35,580
Love

501
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:43,580
After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move marathon

502
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:45,580
Noooo!

503
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:49,580
Just kidding, Orange Lounge Radio, crap-free Bhavani Radio

504
00:41:49,580 --> 00:42:01,580
So, we are back, not only crap-free Bamani Radio, but playing probably the only internet radio station on the planet to be playing Maximizer and all that fun stuff at this time.

505
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:09,580
So, hope you enjoyed that, and it looks like some of you guys maybe missed that, so we'll have to play that after the show is over, definitely for you guys.

506
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:15,660
So, of course, Maximizer being from DDR Extreme USA, which was the big news this week, some

507
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:20,260
very interesting opinions on that game, just kind of all across the spectrum.

508
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:22,820
People love it, people hate it.

509
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:27,340
We'll open it up for some of your opinions as well, but first, what we think of DDR Extreme

510
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:28,340
USA.

511
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:32,500
So, I know some of us have played it a lot, some of us have barely seen it at all, but

512
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,300
kind of, what did you guys think of it?

513
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:37,820
I'll start off with Loki, he had the most exposure to the game, I'm kind of curious,

514
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:39,820
What did you think of it, Logie?

515
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:13,660
revolution cover songs bazaar love triangle that was the only one i liked the rest sucked

516
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:19,260
the singing was just awful and just crap and the steps weren't eh they're okay the news

517
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:25,340
is the konami originals funk boogie pretty cool maximizer not exactly what i was imagining but

518
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:33,020
eh it's okay it's it's like i don't know how to describe it it's annoying but addicting or like

519
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:37,180
you know I don't know it's just I hate that type of music but it's a pretty

520
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:44,780
cool song or something and then you know the two transplants I your rage I are

521
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:49,300
you raining the rage mix I don't like that song anymore it's just annoying and

522
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:54,020
then and you're not here that's a pretty cool song the steps so suck they're all

523
00:43:54,020 --> 00:44:00,380
up it's just all up and then now the best thing going for it and I really

524
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:05,180
don't understand why i didn't have this um to start off with why the fuck do you have to unlock

525
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:10,540
mission mode my god it was the coolest part of the game and you have to unlock it like after a very

526
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:15,420
long time that you finally get mission mode and that was really stupid because that's the best

527
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:21,420
part of the game right there then okay let's talk about the itoy the itoy games are eh they're okay

528
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:25,660
the things that i don't like okay the hands and feet mode actually if you have a well-lit room

529
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:31,660
It works pretty well. The problem is, it's not hard. It's just stupid. It's easy and stupid.

530
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:38,660
And, what they really could have used in this game is edit mode, and where you can make your own hands and feet steps.

531
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:42,660
That would fucking rock. Because you can do some crazy shit there, and it'd be a lot more fun.

532
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:50,660
Um, then the other thing, um, some of the other games, like the Coconut Panic, that was kind of dumb. Amusing, but dumb.

533
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:56,960
the ping pong thing the magic ball or whatever completely stupid I spent five

534
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:01,120
minutes trying to get the fucking ball they hit one stupid block on the screen

535
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:04,520
and because the eye toy is way too fucking sensitive you move your hand and

536
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:10,200
like bounces back and forth like six times mid-motion and so I was trying to

537
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:14,060
fucking get the stupid thing to bounce into the wall and it just would not do

538
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:18,320
it and it frustrated the hell out of me it was just stupid and the other modes

539
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:23,300
that they've got I didn't really play any of the non itoy party modes but

540
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:26,660
they're they're okay from what I've seen they're just kind of I think it'd be

541
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:32,600
more fun if you're drunk and other than that mission mode I had a lot going for

542
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:37,640
it there's a lot of good stuff in mission mode I wish it was longer I wish

543
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:42,640
some of these songs they had some newer songs the character unlocks I really

544
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:47,920
don't care anymore it's just kind of stupid that's pretty much it you know it

545
00:45:47,920 --> 00:46:00,920
It was okay. It's, I don't know. Mission mode will be the only thing that keeps my attention with this game. That's the only thing. Mission mode. Because it's actually the only thing that's challenging this game. That's it.

546
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:08,160
Okay, I'm gonna give you my thoughts. I like the game a lot. I like the game so much. It's

547
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:12,920
probably my favorite home release. It's up there with UltraMix. I'd say this and UltraMix

548
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:18,040
are kind of like my two favorite home mixes right now. Honestly, I think it's very cool.

549
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:22,920
I really like some of the new stuff they put in it. I think there's two big mistakes here

550
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:27,000
though that they made, and this is really... I have to get this off my chest. Everybody's

551
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:32,020
saying this is a this is a seriously it's a game crippling mistake that they

552
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:35,220
made with the game and that was the removal of the dance play setting where

553
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:39,420
you can't turn off the buttons on the pads I don't know how that got

554
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:43,820
overs associated but I know mistakes happen or whatever but that is seriously

555
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:49,300
like that is a game crippling option that is missing they they forgot to have

556
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:52,320
the dance play setting in there which allows you to turn off the buttons on

557
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:55,920
on the pad. Yeah, I know, that was the same reaction I had. I was kinda like,

558
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:59,640
wow. And considering that

559
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:03,480
the whole thing is based on, you know, trying to get up there and dance and move,

560
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:06,920
I realize for a lot of beginner people, they're probably not gonna have that

561
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:10,120
problem. No, no, you know what? No, I take that back, because I was having some friends

562
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:11,040
play it last night,

563
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:15,000
some beginner friends, and they would try to be picking a song, and they'd be stepping on

564
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
my pad, which is an,

565
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,720
you know, it's a $100 red octane ignition pad, and they're fuckin'

566
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:23,800
back it out because they're stepping on the wrong steps on the bottom. They're trying

567
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:32,440
to step off the arrows. And, I just, it was, it's just a horrible oversight. I mean, seriously,

568
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:36,960
I know this sounds insane, but they should fucking recall the game and give us new copies.

569
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:42,280
Like, that's how bad of a mistake I seriously think this is. Okay, in the bright side, well,

570
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:46,200
okay, no, let's keep raining down the bad stuff. What else bad did I want to say about

571
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:49,160
I also do not like the fact that they unlock old songs.

572
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:54,600
I really just hate the repeat songs and you shouldn't unlock old stuff.

573
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:57,960
I think that's really bothersome, but...

574
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:04,060
It would be cool, like, if say, they had an included dropout in every fucking game since

575
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:06,320
in the U.S. mixes, pretty much.

576
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:11,000
If they had, like, I don't know, like a song like, say for instance, I'm in DDR 10th Mix

577
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,520
or whatever it is, and look, there's a song from 1st Mix.

578
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:18,440
Wow, I haven't played that since First Mix. That was a long time ago.

579
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:22,020
That's pretty cool that they're unlocking old stuff for me to play.

580
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:24,720
That's the only situation where that'd be good. Not,

581
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:28,400
Oh, look at that! That was just in that other game I bought!

582
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:33,720
Yay! No. Sorry.

583
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:39,000
Anyway, here's the other mistake I think they made, and this may be kind of, um,

584
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,560
this may be kind of, uh, a little bit controversial, I don't know.

585
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:47,120
But I think the other mistake that they made with this game was calling it DDR Extreme.

586
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:52,700
Because I seriously think that's why you've got so many people that have their expectations on one level.

587
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:59,340
When the product that Konami was trying to deliver was something really different and downright innovative, I think.

588
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:04,160
You know, the fact that there was all these itoi features, and I for one think the itoi features are really cool.

589
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:07,580
I think the party mode thing, that's exactly where it fits.

590
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:12,540
I mean, this is the kind of... it's just like Loki said, you know, this kind of stuff is probably only fun if you're drunk.

591
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:15,420
He's right. This is the kind of thing that you get everybody to come over for,

592
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:19,700
and you have some drinks, and you're playing TDR, and you look like idiots, but it's really, really fun.

593
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:21,860
Like, that's kind of what we were doing last night a little bit.

594
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:25,860
We were playing a little bit of Hands and Feet, beginner stuff, getting some friends into it, and it was fun.

595
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:27,420
I mean, that's what it's all about.

596
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:31,900
Those modes weren't for hardcore players to be challenged, I don't think.

597
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:36,140
They're just stupid fun stuff, and I think it succeeded, and I really like the IToy stuff.

598
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:39,020
I don't have a problem with it at all. I kind of hope they keep it going.

599
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:42,660
I would like to see hands and feet mode get a little more challenging in the next mid.

600
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:44,860
I think that's something they could expand on.

601
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:47,580
Another thing that they didn't include that really needs to be included,

602
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:50,380
sensitivity settings and adjustments for the iToy.

603
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:53,820
How the fuck, if I'm in a dim room, I can't set it to dim room mode,

604
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:57,460
you know, like you can with iToy Play or iToy Groove,

605
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:59,940
they don't have any options to set the iToy stuff,

606
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:02,860
so you can't calibrate it to make it look nice.

607
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:04,940
So you're fucked if you're in a dark room.

608
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:08,300
You can't, you know, set it to be more sensitive.

609
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:12,380
or non-sensitive. If it's too sensitive, then you're fucked. So, that's the other thing

610
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:15,020
that really sucked.

611
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:19,160
I think they should have just, honestly, knowing what we know now about the next Japanese release

612
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:22,780
and seeing as pretty much Konami of Japan made most of this release anyway. You can't

613
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:27,800
really blame the U.S. for what's going on on this release. The dance play setting thing,

614
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:33,780
I'm almost positive is Konami of Japan's fault. We all know the story, we all know the story

615
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:38,980
about the Marvelous Thing and how that was fought by Konami of America to Konami of Japan,

616
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:42,540
and Konami of Japan said, no, they're not changing the Marvelous Thing. And I'll bet,

617
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:47,840
I would bet money, the exact same thing happened with the Dance Play setting. Shame on you,

618
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:51,640
Konami of Japan, for being lazy with that. You really upset a lot of us with that, so,

619
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:56,800
you know, shame on you for that. There's no way I really want to purchase DDR Festival

620
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,300
knowing that, and especially because, you know, well, we'll talk about it later, but

621
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:02,940
Festival doesn't really have that great a song list so far. But if that Dance Play setting

622
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:05,700
isn't going to be in Festival, there's no reason I need to buy it, honestly, there's

623
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:13,700
zero. But, the, I guess really knowing what we know now about DDR Festival, the next Japanese

624
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:18,340
release, they probably should have just called this mix DDR Festival, the US one, they should

625
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:20,900
have just called this mix DDR Festival, and then people wouldn't have gone in with all

626
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:25,100
these expectations like, oh, Cartoon Heroes has to be in it, and Sakura has to be in it,

627
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:29,540
no no no no no. Because honestly, Konami was doing something different with this mix, and

628
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:30,660
And I think it was cool.

629
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:33,620
I for one like the new interface.

630
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:34,780
A lot.

631
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:38,660
And it's not the circle thing that was bugging everybody that people were

632
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:40,740
talking about, like, oh, it looks like third mix and stuff.

633
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:42,720
That's not what I'm talking about, really.

634
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:43,940
That's just one part of it.

635
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:46,540
But really, the rest of the music ends the game.

636
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:51,340
And the way it looks in-game when you're actually playing the game is amazing.

637
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:53,500
It's way better than like any other DDR game.

638
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:54,500
It looks in-game.

639
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:57,300
It takes everything that's great about fourth mix, everything that's great about

640
00:51:57,300 --> 00:52:01,580
Max, the 60 frames per second and stuff, and combines it. I think the interface is the

641
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:06,820
best one they've had yet. With the ONI battery bar and everything, looks great. So what?

642
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:09,540
The wheel looks a little different. It doesn't really bother me at all.

643
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:10,540
I like the wheel better than...

644
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:11,820
You see it for like two seconds.

645
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:16,260
I like the wheel better than the other way, because you... I don't know, it just... Having

646
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:20,060
started with second mix, I think that it makes me think a lot more of the older ones, so

647
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:23,700
I like it better.

648
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:24,700
So...

649
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:25,700
Little records, though.

650
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:31,400
Yeah, the little records would have been cool, but you know, I I don't I don't really care I'd the interface really doesn't bother me

651
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:34,300
It's not something that like ruin the game for me. It didn't really faze me at all

652
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:38,400
I kind of thought oh that's different, but I can see where people who have been kind of

653
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:41,920
Stuck on DDR extreme for several years now

654
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:49,020
Who have really badly because I can't afford a Japanese PlayStation to have wanted something like that for a console for a long time or a little

655
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:50,300
bit

656
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:52,300
disappointed but

657
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:54,700
I have

658
00:52:54,700 --> 00:53:03,000
I know, I know, I know. Honestly, from that standpoint, if Konami knows damn well there's

659
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,720
not going to be any new arcade mixes, which, from Konami of Japan, it doesn't sound like

660
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:12,680
they're ever planning on really doing one, it would have not been smart to release just

661
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:18,120
a port of DER Extreme, because then why would you go to the arcades? So, I think them making

662
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:22,120
it a lot different was probably smart on their end in the end, because you'll still go to

663
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:26,200
arcades to play Sakura and all that stuff so I don't know just kind of my

664
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:33,760
thought supposed to be over here I know but come on come on they know damn well

665
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:39,040
it's here they know damn well extreme is here I think haven't we have this talk

666
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:43,140
on the show with somebody from Konami here and and they said that you know

667
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:47,600
they know it's just one of those things where it's like it's and I always said

668
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:50,440
this they've nobody has confirmed this but this has always been my opinion on

669
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:53,920
this is that it has to do with the music licensing and that it's way easier to

670
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:57,920
get the music license in Japan so if they put that disclaimer on there that

671
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:01,680
says don't use this outside Japan and then oh well gee imagine that the

672
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:05,500
machines ended up in the u.s. gee fancy that how did that happen you know they

673
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:09,520
don't have to you know go and get sued by the record companies because well

674
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:12,200
they have the disclaimer on there it's the arcade owners fault the games in

675
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:14,720
there when it's not supposed to be but at the same time you know they got all

676
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:21,000
great music for DDR and you know I don't know that's just my thought would you I

677
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,560
know you didn't get to play it a whole lot Jamie but what'd you think of

678
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:27,240
extreme just kind of looking at it it's okay I like the non-stop music when

679
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:33,240
you're picking the non-stop that music was just pretty cool yeah the mini music

680
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:38,520
was really good I like the new mods that they're doing in this mission mode those

681
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:42,960
are really cool and also Aaron Japan's gonna hack those out and put those in

682
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:49,960
the normal game. But feeding time? Feeding time scared me. So stupid. Angel, I know you

683
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:55,680
got to play a lot of Xtreme this week, what were your thoughts? I'm going to open up the

684
00:54:55,680 --> 00:55:00,920
Skype line soon for your thoughts, but I want to get everybody in the studio first. Well,

685
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:06,920
I didn't get to play too much of it, considering I had just gotten it, what day was it, really,

686
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:13,480
Anyway, um, the thing that kinda got me down was, um, Unlocking Your Rain, like, the second

687
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:15,840
song I played, I'm like, no!

688
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:19,480
I wish that it was, you know, like, the last song, just cause, like, that was the song

689
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:21,680
I was really looking forward to, but actually...

690
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,080
Isn't Your Rain in there by default?

691
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:24,640
Did you just miss it the first game, maybe?

692
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:25,920
I thought it was in there by default.

693
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:30,520
I might have, um, but, I don't know.

694
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:31,840
I don't know.

695
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:32,840
I just...

696
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:39,800
oh okay well anyway yeah that was kind of a downer I know there's other stuff

697
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:45,260
that I probably have yet to unlock like the BT song and the oh whatever all the

698
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:49,000
other songs that we've been playing today but you know what that's just for

699
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:56,880
the week to come and how many games how many games will it take before you make

700
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:05,720
Make more steps for Max 2 Oni songs, or the Max 1 Oni songs, whatever song, you know,

701
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:11,020
Max 2 Oni songs, come on now, I mean Zagaru Apple Mix has been out forever now, make some

702
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:16,780
new fucking steps, it doesn't take that long, seriously, just make new steps, complete them,

703
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:23,180
they did it in the UK, you know, with B4U before the beat mix in um, history of 2001,

704
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:25,700
They did it there, because they like to be complete.

705
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:26,700
But no!

706
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:28,300
You know, we just have to be lazy!

707
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:32,460
We're only going to have challenge steps, because we don't want to make new steps.

708
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:33,460
Yeah.

709
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:39,060
So get off your ass and make new steps.

710
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:43,740
Anyway, I think this mix will hold me over just fine until Ultra Mix 2 comes out.

711
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:47,940
But you know what, seriously, the bar of expectations is just so high with Ultra Mix 2 right now

712
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:51,000
with everything I've heard about it, it's just kind of like, I'm almost going to feel

713
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:55,840
feel bad when it comes out because it's probably not going to... I don't know, I don't know.

714
00:56:55,840 --> 00:57:00,320
I mean, my bar is so high for Ultramix 2 that that is really the one I'm waiting for at

715
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:04,000
this point. I mean, Extreme's cool and all though, don't get me wrong. I do recommend

716
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,480
if you are a DDR fan and you have a PlayStation 2, you should have this game. You should have

717
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:12,680
this game. If you have a Japanese PlayStation 2, then I guess you have a choice. But if

718
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:18,080
you have a US one, then you really should just get this game. I mean, it's DDR and it's

719
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:19,080
good.

720
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:44,080
Oh. Yeah. Anyway. Okay. I don't know. I'll play more this week. And, you know, unlock more crap. And maybe I'll like it more. But right now, as soon as I saw you ran, I was like, no! Big disappointment for me, but I'll keep playing. Shane, don't hit me, please!

721
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:50,080
Bradley, you're a DDR fan. You mentioned at the beginning of the show you were a little bit disappointed with the mix. Just kind of curious on your thoughts.

722
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:59,080
Well, based on what I saw, I wasn't that impressed with it. It wasn't bad. It was just, meh. It didn't make me excited or anything.

723
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:06,080
But, I probably wouldn't, if I got to see Master Mode, or whatever that is called.

724
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:09,080
Because we didn't unlock that while I was here.

725
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:10,080
Oh, the Maximizer?

726
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:13,080
No, not Maximizer, the Master Mode.

727
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:16,080
Oh, Mission Mode, yeah.

728
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:22,080
It says I like to do those kind of weird things, and owning modes and things like that.

729
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:25,080
It says it's straight up BDR when I play it at home mixes.

730
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:26,080
You know, that kind of remind-

731
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:27,080
So I don't have them anymore.

732
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:31,080
That reminded me of something, is a lot of people were really upset because there were no, like, 10-foot steps for Maximizer,

733
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:33,080
because supposedly Maximizer is supposed to be this new Ma-

734
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:36,080
Well, okay, whatever, they have the Mission Mode thing, but you know what I'm talking about.

735
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:38,080
Like, they don't have, like, steps in-game.

736
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:42,760
I'm kinda like big deal because for me honestly I don't get

737
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:47,160
the desire to have like all these insane 10-footers on home because

738
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:51,440
how in the hell are you going to pass that stuff on a home pad? I mean I realize people do it

739
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:56,480
but for, and I'm one of them, I've been playing DDR for years and there's no way in hell I'd be

740
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:58,080
passing half those 10-footers on a

741
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:01,800
on a home pad. It's like you just can't do it. It's not the same as the arcade. I mean

742
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:03,800
granted you may have a metal stage or whatever

743
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:08,040
but if that's the case you are in the minority. Let's face it, you are not

744
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:13,280
the majority of, you know, the people that are gonna be picking up DDR, you are the minority,

745
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:17,360
and if, you know, Konami's gonna cater to you, you're, like, extra special if you get

746
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:18,600
your 10-footer, so,

747
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:22,560
you know, whatever. I just, I just don't see the point in bitching about there not being

748
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:24,200
a lot of new 10-footers, because,

749
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:28,240
especially with the dance play setting not being fucked up.

750
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:32,520
How in, now how are you gonna pass 10-footers? Now the dance play setting's there, it's like, ugh.

751
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:36,960
Unless you're playing Button Button Revolution, but that's not what DDR's supposed to be for.

752
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:40,760
Then they wouldn't be getting their weight loss news stories and stuff. Anyway, I'm done. I'm done

753
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:45,440
Anything else anybody? Okay

754
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:50,560
I'm sorry. Let's go to a break and then I'm gonna open up the skype line and we'll get your thoughts and

755
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:55,060
Speaking of DDR in the news. We want to get to that story because DDR was in the news again this week

756
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:58,160
So, of course, you know, we got to mention that this break

757
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:02,720
We're gonna do some of those karaoke revolution songs because there's surprisingly some decent ones

758
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:06,400
I will not be playing waiting for tonight though because I fucking hate that one

759
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:10,960
But we will play bizarre love triangle and some other stuff enjoy

760
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:16,200
We'll be back and with the skype line open up your thoughts on DDR extreme, and if you want to

761
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:23,200
to argue with us on some point? Go for it!

762
01:00:46,200 --> 01:01:01,200
Every time I see you fallin', I keep your love, my only friend

763
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:09,200
I'm waiting for that final moment to say the words that I can't say

764
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:42,200
Every time I see you for a long time Get down on my knees and cry

765
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:47,200
I'm ready to go, I'll find you now I'm ready to go

766
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:20,180
And I'm feeling like, oh yes, the blade is in life

767
01:02:20,180 --> 01:02:22,180
Oh, what a night

768
01:02:22,180 --> 01:02:24,180
Oh, yes, the blade is in life

769
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:28,180
And I'm feeling like, oh yes, the blade is in life

770
01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:30,180
Oh, what a night

771
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:32,180
Oh, baby

772
01:02:34,180 --> 01:02:36,180
Oh, baby

773
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:40,180
Mmm, it's a fistful pain in my mouth

774
01:02:40,180 --> 01:02:44,180
Oh, you destroy me, yeah

775
01:02:44,180 --> 01:02:47,180
Yeah, stay with me, my, my

776
01:03:17,180 --> 01:03:33,480
Oh yes it's early in the night, and you're feeling light

777
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:46,260
Oh yes it's early in the night, and you're feeling light

778
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:56,260
No matter how hard I try, you keep pushing me inside and I can't break through.

779
01:03:56,260 --> 01:04:04,260
There's no talking to you, it's so sad that you're leaving.

780
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:08,260
It takes time to believe it

781
01:04:08,260 --> 01:04:12,260
But after all is said and done

782
01:04:12,260 --> 01:04:16,260
You're gonna be the lonely one, whoa

783
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:20,260
Do you believe in life after all?

784
01:04:20,260 --> 01:04:26,260
I can feel your blood inside your face

785
01:04:26,260 --> 01:04:30,260
I really don't take it from you, no, no

786
01:05:00,260 --> 01:05:03,260
I need a life I can talk

787
01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:09,260
If I can feel the pain, if I can say

788
01:05:09,260 --> 01:05:13,260
When you really don't think, I won't even know

789
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:30,460
We're back.

790
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:34,180
I forgot to even talk about the Karaoke Revolution songs in DDRXtreme, but playing those kind

791
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:37,660
of reminded me of some of the reactions from the chatroom.

792
01:05:37,660 --> 01:05:40,380
Karaoke Revolution is honest, I thought I was going to love it.

793
01:05:40,380 --> 01:05:43,900
It was going to be a great idea.

794
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:46,840
But to be honest, I'm not a big fan of any of the Karaoke Revolution

795
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:47,380
transplants.

796
01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:49,460
I mean, maybe a couple are OK.

797
01:05:49,460 --> 01:05:52,140
But at the same time, it's kind of like I kind of applaud

798
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:53,780
Konami for trying that.

799
01:05:53,780 --> 01:05:56,100
Because it was a pretty clever idea

800
01:05:56,100 --> 01:05:58,940
to get some big dance songs in DDR

801
01:05:58,940 --> 01:06:00,700
without having to pay such a high license

802
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:02,900
fee is to put in the covers.

803
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:05,220
It's just that the covers aren't that hot.

804
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:14,220
But, I think it's a neat idea, and, you know, maybe they'll do it better next time. I don't know, but, I can't say I'm a huge fan of any of those songs, but that's me personally. I'm not really a huge fan of any of those.

805
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:16,220
I really love that the original songs were good too.

806
01:06:19,220 --> 01:06:21,220
You don't think the original Bizarre Love Triangle is good?

807
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:25,220
The original, no, the original Bizarre Love Triangle was excellent. I'm talking about the Cher song.

808
01:06:25,220 --> 01:06:26,220
Oh, okay.

809
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:28,220
Woman's career was over a long time ago.

810
01:06:29,220 --> 01:06:30,220
Gotcha. Alright.

811
01:06:30,220 --> 01:06:32,780
alright

812
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:34,620
uh... i i've got

813
01:06:34,620 --> 01:06:38,420
i've got to bring up the uh...

814
01:06:38,420 --> 01:06:42,420
i'm glad the uh... mike phone didn't pick that up

815
01:06:42,420 --> 01:06:44,260
i've not even been done

816
01:06:44,260 --> 01:06:44,980
here

817
01:06:44,980 --> 01:06:48,980
i said why can't she ski into a tree she had skied into the tree she would have

818
01:06:48,980 --> 01:06:54,220
bounced off a mobile plastic interface anyway

819
01:06:54,220 --> 01:06:59,160
on a different note i want to talk about the uh... i carry a mocha cd contest

820
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:03,340
Because you know we're going to be giving away autographed CDs by Kiryamoka.

821
01:07:03,340 --> 01:07:09,380
It is the Silent Hill mini CDs, a mini CD soundtrack from Silent Hill 4.

822
01:07:09,380 --> 01:07:10,640
We're giving those away.

823
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:15,280
The contest was supposed to start tomorrow, however we did make an executive decision

824
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:19,860
to push that back by one week because we want to let the hype build up.

825
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:24,020
Unfortunately because I was out last week and Jamie was really busy last week, we kind

826
01:07:24,020 --> 01:07:27,020
of didn't get a chance to really finalize the rules and everything we wanted to do.

827
01:07:27,020 --> 01:07:30,760
We will post those rules after the show tonight at some point.

828
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:33,500
Probably check for it tomorrow on our website, orangeandredo.com.

829
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:36,420
We will be starting the contest next Monday.

830
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:39,620
You're going to have to listen Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday night.

831
01:07:39,620 --> 01:07:43,580
If you can't listen, get your friend to listen because we've got to be giving out some trivia

832
01:07:43,580 --> 01:07:47,660
questions that you're going to have to answer to correctly be put in the drawing to win

833
01:07:47,660 --> 01:07:48,660
one of those CDs.

834
01:07:48,660 --> 01:07:52,340
You don't want to miss it, so we're going to be starting that next Monday.

835
01:07:52,340 --> 01:07:56,960
And of course, a big thank you to one of our partner sites, ddrspot.com, for helping us

836
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:57,960
out with this contest.

837
01:07:57,960 --> 01:07:59,980
And they're going to be giving away some CDs too.

838
01:07:59,980 --> 01:08:03,180
So if you don't win with us, go try and win with them, because they're going to be doing

839
01:08:03,180 --> 01:08:04,180
their own contest.

840
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:05,180
I don't know what they're doing yet, though.

841
01:08:05,180 --> 01:08:07,740
They haven't even clued me in, but that's all right.

842
01:08:07,740 --> 01:08:09,280
So definitely check them out.

843
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:10,820
And they're going to be relaunching their site.

844
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:12,820
I don't want to give too much away, though.

845
01:08:12,820 --> 01:08:14,700
I think I already said too much.

846
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:15,700
All right.

847
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:22,700
As promised, let's open up the Skype line and see what your thoughts are on DDR Extreme USA.

848
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:29,700
Of course, I've got to wait because there's the delay, so I probably should open it up a little sooner, but that's alright.

849
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:36,700
I'm trying to think of other things about the mix that I wanted to bring up.

850
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:39,700
Things about DDR Extreme USA while the Skype line is opening up.

851
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:43,700
www.orensontradio.com, click on interact with us if you want the information.

852
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:46,700
If you don't get through the first time, try again in a little bit.

853
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:48,700
But we do have a call. Let's go to it.

854
01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:50,700
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

855
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:52,700
Hey, this is Al Mullet again.

856
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:54,700
Hello, Mr. Mullet. How are you doing?

857
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:56,700
Pretty good, Sky. How about yourself?

858
01:08:56,700 --> 01:09:01,700
I'm doing great. I feel refreshed after a little vacation last week.

859
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:05,700
It's good to get away once in a while.

860
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:09,700
All right. What are your thoughts, buddy, on DDR Extreme USA?

861
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:14,700
Oh, DDR Extreme. So many complaints. So many complaints.

862
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:19,700
I still haven't played the game where all these complaints are directed towards, because I played a very decent game.

863
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:24,700
So you must have been playing some completely different game than everybody else, huh?

864
01:09:24,700 --> 01:09:34,700
Pretty much. I mean, I fully enjoyed the song list. I mean, there are a few that I didn't like, but I mean, out of 70 songs, you're going to have a few that you don't like.

865
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:41,700
I agree, I agree. There's gonna be that let them move, or in the case of DDR Max 2, Forever Sunshine. Sorry, Seagrid.

866
01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:44,700
Oh, please. Forever Sunshine was good.

867
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:48,700
Oh, please yourself. Alright, alright. To each his own. Whatever.

868
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:50,700
To each their own. Agree to disagree.

869
01:09:50,700 --> 01:09:58,700
But, um, what would you say, since the complaints are kinda bugging you, it sounds like, what would you say is the number one complaint that you're just like, shut up.

870
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:06,380
That's just these one-line complaints saying, oh my god, I hate this game, go get Japanese

871
01:10:06,380 --> 01:10:07,380
Extreme.

872
01:10:07,380 --> 01:10:10,180
What's the point?

873
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:13,160
So basically people saying this mix isn't Japanese enough?

874
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:14,420
It's not Japanese enough.

875
01:10:14,420 --> 01:10:16,420
I'm not even Japanese enough.

876
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:21,100
Ironic, considering this game was pretty much made by Konami of Japan, we've pretty much

877
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:22,100
found out.

878
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:25,700
If you don't think it's Japanese enough, just play the stupid feeding frenzy mode.

879
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:28,140
Seriously, that is very Japanese.

880
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:33,540
Or just frickin' play DDR Festival, because, as you may have heard, the DDR Festival song list came out this week.

881
01:10:33,540 --> 01:10:36,540
Don't get me started on Festival, dude. We got...

882
01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:45,040
We'll read the song list to you guys later, but so far, it sounds like it's kind of a chance for the Japanese to catch up on everything they've been missing here.

883
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:46,040
Really, is what it is.

884
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:50,540
If you own the last four American mixes, you own DDR Festival.

885
01:10:50,540 --> 01:10:56,640
Pretty much. I mean, of course, we don't know. Now, there could be something unlocked, or there might be some cool features they haven't talked about yet, but...

886
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:59,640
I'm betting on 22 Donk. I'm betting on 22 Donk.

887
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:02,640
Assumably, it's all the same.

888
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:08,640
It's gonna be totally like Max 1, the Japanese one, with the whole two unlocks.

889
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:12,640
Whoo! Two unlocks! Oh my God! There's gotta be more, right?

890
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:16,640
If I play like 500 times, there'll be more? Nope.

891
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:20,640
Or was that Max 2 with three unlocks? Oh my God, will there be four?

892
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:22,640
Oh wait, no, it was Party Collection.

893
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:26,640
I'm gonna guess that there's gonna be five unlocks in this next game.

894
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:29,640
Five unlocks. Brand new.

895
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:33,640
So noted. What was your favorite thing about Extreme USA, Mr. Mullet?

896
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:36,640
My favorite thing? Easily the mission mode.

897
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:39,640
I mean, I didn't think there was gonna be that many missions

898
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:41,640
and I didn't get a chance to play the game until Thursday

899
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:46,640
so I had to wade through about a billion complaints on the freak forums.

900
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:50,640
But as soon as I heard someone say something about Mission 75

901
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:55,840
hold on back at the car 75 yeah I know and there's a lot of missions there I

902
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:59,680
think even here in studio we're only through like mission 53 we've just

903
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:02,640
haven't had enough time to play through all the missions have you checked out

904
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:08,880
mission 38 yet that was the one with absolute it was absolute and it was all

905
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:14,580
these different speeds oh that was fun but then again wait till you get there's

906
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:20,000
one in the second half with Firefly heavy same deal oh geez speeds up slows

907
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:26,800
down and apparently near the very end like 98 or 99 there's the official

908
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:33,560
fucked-up frozen ray mission where it's reverse scroll, dark, arrows mixed up with

909
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:38,280
random speed changes. Oh my gosh. What is that? What mission number is that? It's

910
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:44,560
either 98 or 90. It's in the last five. Oh my god. I did the one, there was a frozen ray one

911
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:48,440
and I had to turn the controller upside down to do it. I think it was on, it was

912
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:55,200
like 49 or something. It's crazy. Mission 50. Mission 50. It took me over 50 tries for

913
01:12:55,200 --> 01:13:01,480
that one, and I did it with my pad right side up, and I managed to, I had to memorize the

914
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:05,080
first part without looking at the screen. I could do this mission now without looking

915
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:11,220
at the screen. I'll tell you, the one that stuck me for the longest time, and I don't,

916
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:17,200
I can't believe this one took me as long as it did, but it's Your Rain on point five and

917
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:18,200
dark

918
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:21,460
and i swear to god we had to do it like forty times to beat it

919
01:13:21,460 --> 01:13:22,860
it didn't take me that long

920
01:13:22,860 --> 01:13:26,140
do we ever get the one done where you have to use kick the can we have to get

921
01:13:26,140 --> 01:13:31,140
to what twenty of each twenty good twenty grades twenty perfect

922
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:34,180
we're still stuck on that one that's like in the easy britain budget we're

923
01:13:34,180 --> 01:13:37,540
still stuck on it we can do it i mean it's it's too hard to get goods press

924
01:13:37,540 --> 01:13:38,580
earlier like

925
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:41,340
of the twenty great good perfect one

926
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:43,020
again as a pass that

927
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:44,860
took me a while to

928
01:13:44,860 --> 01:13:48,120
but I mean there's like some of them that were apparently very hard and that I

929
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:49,960
couldn't um...

930
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:51,820
pass

931
01:13:51,820 --> 01:13:55,240
or like I could pass that was like really surprising there's apparently some easy

932
01:13:55,240 --> 01:14:01,160
ones that took me forever. I guess it all depends on what you can do and what you can't.

933
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:02,640
Boy, that came out wrong.

934
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:06,960
That's alright.

935
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:08,720
That's alright.

936
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:12,960
Uh... you know we have... this... this whole show is just one big three hour brain

937
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:19,960
fart really so don't worry about it. We're doing a show. Yeah I know. Why don't you plug

938
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:23,980
your site again because you have this really nifty column over on that site and people

939
01:14:23,980 --> 01:14:30,980
should go look at it. Oh yes, www.insidepulse.com. Expect a DDR extreme review that actually

940
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:39,360
praises the game for what it has rather than what it doesn't have within reason. It's like

941
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:56,360
It's like I don't bash the game because it doesn't have Sakura, for example, but I will point out some of the fatal flaws as it were, but I mean, to be totally honest, this game has enough material in it to make this the greatest home version ever.

942
01:14:57,360 --> 01:15:01,360
Until next month when we get UltraMix 2, or November really.

943
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:08,800
Really? I'm telling you, I'm telling you. Based on the hype alone, UltraMix 2 all the

944
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:09,800
way. But we'll see.

945
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:12,920
That's true. Well anyway, I'm going to finish my thought if you don't mind.

946
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:13,920
Sure.

947
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:18,000
Like I said, it has enough material to make this the greatest home version ever, but it

948
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:23,720
has enough, it has the critical dance pad error, which really didn't affect me that

949
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:27,600
much, but it has that error and it has a few other errors to bring it, you know, right

950
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:31,600
back down, but the good far outweighs the bad, really.

951
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:35,920
I agree, the good outweighs the bad. The dance pad thing is really annoying, but I'll get

952
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:37,600
over it some day. Somehow I'll survive.

953
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:42,600
When are you going to start writing for the wrestling portion of the site? That's what

954
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:45,600
I'm curious about.

955
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:48,600
The wrestling portion.

956
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:53,200
Get some wrasslin'. Are you looking forward to Rumble Roses? All the boys on that site

957
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:58,440
Must be looking forward to rumble roses. Come on. You got the bimani artist. You got the raslin

958
01:15:59,260 --> 01:16:01,260
boobies, come on

959
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:06,920
If I get that game, it'll be the here look to the sky again. All right, I don't care. Yeah

960
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:09,840
Look to the sky and boobies, right?

961
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:13,360
Look to the boobies look to the boobies exactly. That's rumble road

962
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:18,420
That's you that should be it. Like, you know how when they advertise things they have that tagline should be rumble roses

963
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:20,440
Look to the boobies

964
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:22,440
Look to the boobies!

965
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:26,440
Awesome action gameplay! Realistic wrestling moves!

966
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:28,440
Lots of boobies!

967
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:30,440
And mud! Don't forget the mud!

968
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:32,440
Flesh colored mud.

969
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:34,440
Look to the boobies! True color mix.

970
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:38,440
Alright, I'm hanging up on you, Mullet. We gotta let some other people call in.

971
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:40,440
But thanks for the input, as always.

972
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:42,440
Have a good one!

973
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:44,440
Yay, it's always good to talk to him.

974
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:47,440
Alright, we'll reopen the Skype line if somebody else wants to call in.

975
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:50,440
And let us know their thoughts on DDR Extreme USA.

976
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:55,440
We're going to have to kind of start shifting gears here in a little bit, though, because we definitely want to get to the cage match.

977
01:16:55,440 --> 01:17:02,440
Of course, now we've got to get to our FUs. And I still want to talk about In the Groove at some point, and all that other stuff as well.

978
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:04,440
Wasn't that a Madonna song?

979
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:09,440
No, that's Into the Groove. That's Into the Groove. Not In the Groove.

980
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:12,440
In the Groove's a little different.

981
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:14,440
Yay, another caller.

982
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:17,640
Howdy, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, what's up?

983
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:21,160
Yo, it's Dork. Hey Dork, what's going on?

984
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:24,740
Not much. I love, I love this name.

985
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:28,440
We have, I swear, I'm declaring that our listeners

986
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:32,120
have the coolest handles on the internet. Between like El Mullet

987
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:36,440
and Dork, come on. Hey, you guys win at the internet. Captain Canada, yeah.

988
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:39,960
You guys win at the internet. Hey Dork, guess who?

989
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:42,960
Anyways, on the subject of, uh-

990
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:44,960
Oh, fine, don't guess who.

991
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:46,960
You're fired!

992
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:47,960
What's up?

993
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:49,960
Angel's taking over. What's up, Dork?

994
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:50,960
Never mind. What's up, Dork?

995
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:52,960
Hi.

996
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:53,960
Huh?

997
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:54,960
Repeat, please.

998
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:57,960
What's going on? Sorry, you have to repeat. There was chaos.

999
01:17:57,960 --> 01:17:58,960
Uh, wait...

1000
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:00,960
What? Angel was talking?

1001
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:01,960
Yeah, she was.

1002
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:02,960
It's your turn.

1003
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:03,960
That's right. It's your turn. What's up?

1004
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:04,960
No, what did she say? I want to know.

1005
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:06,960
She was trying to say hi.

1006
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:08,960
But I think there was a delay or something

1007
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:12,320
something and it messed everything up. Well, what's up? What's your thoughts on Extreme?

1008
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:16,440
Well, I got some good thoughts and bad thoughts. I

1009
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:20,160
kind of said some good in bed on Wednesday, but

1010
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:24,080
I might as well just reiterate the

1011
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:27,400
song list. It could be better, right?

1012
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:32,200
It could be better, but at the same time remember that you're trying to please

1013
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:35,960
millions of people, so you really have to take a little bit of everything.

1014
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:59,960
Granted, how stuff like Let Them Move still stays in DDR, I'll never understand, but for the most part, you have to remember you have to satisfy everybody, so there's always the way the song list could be improved to match our own personal taste, but if you change the song list to what you would like, then somebody else would hate the game. So, you know. But I understand, I understand. You could always just have more songs, hey?

1015
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:03,960
Maybe so, but let's see here.

1016
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:07,180
Um, I don't know. I kind of figured that

1017
01:19:07,180 --> 01:19:10,860
only in non-stop are a bit too easy, don't you think?

1018
01:19:10,860 --> 01:19:16,120
Um, maybe. I think some of the non-stops are a little bit too easy,

1019
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:20,160
but then again, everything is difficult with that dance play option being gone.

1020
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:23,280
So, yeah. But then again,

1021
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:28,120
to negate all that, you have mission mode. That's true. Which is really awesome. Mission mode is very

1022
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:28,680
awesome.

1023
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:32,680
It's one of the coolest things in DDR yet, next to online play.

1024
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:42,680
Oh, by the way, the Frozen Ray on Heavy with the one on dark, reverse, and mixed up arrows, that's mission 98.

1025
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:47,680
Mission 98, thank you. We haven't gotten there yet, we're a little slow.

1026
01:19:47,680 --> 01:19:53,680
Yeah, I tried that one like up to like 100 something times already.

1027
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:57,680
So on a scale of 1 to 5, how would you rate DDR Extreme?

1028
01:19:57,680 --> 01:19:58,680
Two.

1029
01:19:58,680 --> 01:19:59,680
Two?

1030
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:00,680
Oh, ouch.

1031
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:01,680
Alright.

1032
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:02,680
Two.

1033
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:05,400
What would you say was your least favorite thing about the whole game?

1034
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:07,400
Least favorite?

1035
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:08,400
Songless.

1036
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:09,400
Songless.

1037
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:10,400
Ouch.

1038
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:11,400
Songless.

1039
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:12,400
Oh well.

1040
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:13,400
Yes.

1041
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:14,400
Maybe next time.

1042
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:15,400
Definitely the songless.

1043
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:16,400
Maybe next time.

1044
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:17,400
Alright, we're gonna let you go so we can talk to some other folks.

1045
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:18,400
Alright, later.

1046
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:19,400
But thanks for the call, Dork.

1047
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:20,400
We appreciate it.

1048
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:21,400
Alright.

1049
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:22,400
Have a good one.

1050
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:23,400
I think there was a little bit of delay.

1051
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:24,400
Hi, Dork.

1052
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:27,160
I think I could hear myself a little bit in there, so I think maybe there was just a lot

1053
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:32,120
too much noise. Be careful guys, when you call in, make sure you mute Winamp.

1054
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:35,820
I can feel the evil vibes building in this room.

1055
01:20:35,820 --> 01:20:40,800
Why? Thanks to Loki's device. Oh god, Loki's trying to finish his little device over there, the one

1056
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:44,800
he's been working on for like the past like three episodes or something.

1057
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:48,000
I feel the evil is close.

1058
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:51,200
I feel that Satan's gonna come up and just burn up the floor.

1059
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:54,660
Alright, we got another caller. This is gonna be the last one for now.

1060
01:20:54,660 --> 01:20:56,280
What's up?

1061
01:20:56,280 --> 01:21:00,120
you are going to have led to get the last call pay target while the last call

1062
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:02,260
ever but for this segment and you'll take

1063
01:21:02,260 --> 01:21:05,680
if we have time to be in the shelter market on this call

1064
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:10,080
yes it is but for now you're the lucky one

1065
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:10,840
what happened

1066
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:13,540
what's your thoughts on the art stream dark night

1067
01:21:13,540 --> 01:21:17,520
it's okay and what not to add some little doubt that

1068
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:19,560
i wanted to downsize

1069
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:23,440
agree with you with the dance play thing that kind of knows that one of the late

1070
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:28,200
stuff is missing. I'm like, uh, oh, I can't cut the X arrows off.

1071
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:31,640
Yeah, the dance play thing was a real bummer. What else?

1072
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:37,240
Mission mode was okay. I'm kinda slow because I'm still stuck on mission 15.

1073
01:21:37,240 --> 01:21:40,760
It's hard! But they do have the crazy missions on there.

1074
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:45,120
One, it was like all the arrows were bunched up into one big arrow.

1075
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:49,000
You didn't know which way you had to hit it. I haven't seen that one yet.

1076
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:52,720
It's like all the arrows get bunched, jammed into one arrow.

1077
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:54,720
Wow, I have to...

1078
01:21:54,720 --> 01:21:56,720
It scrolls like one line.

1079
01:21:56,720 --> 01:22:00,720
Loki played like half a mission mode while I was out of town, but it's cool.

1080
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:02,720
I gotta look at some of these other missions that I missed out on.

1081
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:04,720
Maybe I'll just erase the file and start over.

1082
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:09,720
And then there was like one mission where you had to deliberately get no goods on all free zeroes.

1083
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:13,720
I'm like, I can't do that. My feet doesn't let me do that.

1084
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:14,720
Wow.

1085
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:15,720
I know I failed it like six times.

1086
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:18,720
Left the one with Maximizer can't get a combo higher than four.

1087
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:24,720
Or the set points where you have to get it in between points or you're gonna fail, regardless.

1088
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:28,720
Exactly. Crazy stuff. Alright, what would you say was your favorite thing about DDR Extreme USA?

1089
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:33,720
Some of the songs on there were pretty good. I didn't like the UltraMix covers.

1090
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:40,720
Some of the original ones on there were pretty good. Like, I definitely liked the one called Music. I liked that one on there.

1091
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:42,720
Music. We're gonna play that in our next break.

1092
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:47,720
Yeah, I mean that was pretty good. I haven't opened up all the songs yet. I'm way, way behind on that.

1093
01:22:47,720 --> 01:22:58,720
And then, of course, they have the ability to go to challenge or non-stop while picking, instead of having to pick it early, you can pick it on the song rotation.

1094
01:22:58,720 --> 01:22:59,720
Huh.

1095
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:07,720
So when you're looking at it, you're hearing the second song, and you're like, I want to do a challenge stuff. So you go to challenge, and you go to challenge mode.

1096
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:09,720
Gotcha, gotcha. Yeah.

1097
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:16,020
like that one I guess the odd stuff hyper dash the only thing I'm like on it

1098
01:23:16,020 --> 01:23:20,540
anything else I ain't even want to attempt to even try just by looking I'm

1099
01:23:20,540 --> 01:23:27,420
like no no but like all in all all in all do I give it but I'll give the REX

1100
01:23:27,420 --> 01:23:33,300
about it at least an 8. An 8 out of 10? An 8 out of 10. All right sounds good hey thanks for the

1101
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:35,780
call Dark Knight we gotta let you go cuz we're gonna get to break but thanks for

1102
01:23:35,780 --> 01:23:38,700
your input have a good one all right all right bye

1103
01:23:38,700 --> 01:23:43,700
We will take more calls a little later on during the show about DDR Extreme USA and your thoughts.

1104
01:23:43,700 --> 01:23:49,700
We do like hearing what our listeners have to say, because, you know, they know more than we do most of the time, which is the sad truth.

1105
01:23:49,700 --> 01:23:52,700
Alright, we are going to go to a break, though, when we come back.

1106
01:23:52,700 --> 01:23:56,700
My review of In the Groove and the Cage Match when we get back.

1107
01:23:56,700 --> 01:24:00,700
After this, starting off with some more licensed music from DDR Extreme.

1108
01:24:00,700 --> 01:24:05,200
I know some folks in chat room wanted to hear this. So here you go some music for you guys. Enjoy

1109
01:25:30,700 --> 01:25:32,700
You

1110
01:26:00,700 --> 01:26:18,700
Together

1111
01:26:18,700 --> 01:26:21,700
We will go our way

1112
01:26:21,700 --> 01:26:22,700
Together

1113
01:26:22,700 --> 01:26:25,700
We will leave someday

1114
01:26:25,700 --> 01:26:26,700
Together

1115
01:26:26,700 --> 01:26:29,700
With your hand in my hand

1116
01:26:29,700 --> 01:26:37,700
We will make our friends, we will fight so high

1117
01:26:37,700 --> 01:26:41,700
Tell all our friends goodbye

1118
01:26:41,700 --> 01:26:45,700
We will be not like you

1119
01:26:45,700 --> 01:26:49,700
This is what we'll do

1120
01:26:49,700 --> 01:26:53,700
Like a peaceful land

1121
01:26:53,700 --> 01:26:57,700
In the almost end

1122
01:26:57,700 --> 01:27:05,700
Where the skies are blue This is what we're gonna do

1123
01:27:05,700 --> 01:27:09,700
There are many ways

1124
01:27:39,700 --> 01:27:52,500
Don't get me poppin' cuz in the century there is such a place that creates such a melody

1125
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:56,500
A work who's by the plan of a murder jam, get up and dance

1126
01:27:56,500 --> 01:28:03,700
Diamonds take the green of our streets, make your body weight

1127
01:28:03,700 --> 01:28:07,700
Socialize, get down, let's go away, make it now

1128
01:28:07,700 --> 01:28:12,700
And now, no ladies, it's amazing, love myself!

1129
01:28:37,700 --> 01:29:03,880
Orange Lounge Radio, Bahmani Music, and more.

1130
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:09,400
We are back with Orange Lounge Radio, talking about DDR Extreme USA mostly, but you know,

1131
01:29:09,400 --> 01:29:13,660
just by coincidence, tonight was probably going to be dominated by DDR Extreme USA chat,

1132
01:29:13,660 --> 01:29:20,660
but I got a chance to play In the Groove this week, which is the other Bamani-ish game.

1133
01:29:20,660 --> 01:29:25,120
It's not really a Bamani game, but you all know the story.

1134
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:26,120
You want...

1135
01:29:26,120 --> 01:29:27,120
Oh, okay.

1136
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:28,120
I'm sorry.

1137
01:29:28,120 --> 01:29:30,480
Dark Sakura was barking orders at Angel.

1138
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:31,480
Just kidding.

1139
01:29:31,480 --> 01:29:36,480
I asked very nicely, okay? I said, would you please get me a napkin?

1140
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:38,480
But you barked it a little. No, I'm kidding.

1141
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:40,480
I'll show you bark.

1142
01:29:40,480 --> 01:29:42,480
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1143
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:43,480
Alright.

1144
01:29:43,480 --> 01:29:48,480
In the Groove's been...it's controversial.

1145
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:50,480
Let's just leave it at that. It's a controversial game.

1146
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:53,480
Many folks are like, what the hell is this?

1147
01:29:53,480 --> 01:29:59,480
Basically, for those who don't know, the folks that did StepMania, which is the DDR sim,

1148
01:29:59,480 --> 01:30:03,880
teamed up with some other folks in Seattle, I guess, I don't know what they did before,

1149
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:09,400
teamed up with this Rock Store Games thing to put together a new machine for the US,

1150
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:15,320
I'm assuming, to make up for a lack of new DDR mixes in the US. Although,

1151
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:20,360
I'm sure they would tell you this has nothing to do with DDR, they just want to make a brand

1152
01:30:20,360 --> 01:30:25,400
new music game to kind of give something for the music fans to appreciate. So I got to play the

1153
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:30,800
game I went to eight on the break where they are beta testing it I guess from

1154
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:34,760
what I understand I actually checked one of the big websites itgfreak.com

1155
01:30:34,760 --> 01:30:41,740
funny itgfreak I checked this site out and it's apparently still a beta

1156
01:30:41,740 --> 01:30:45,580
machine even though the full version is out but it looked pretty finished to me

1157
01:30:45,580 --> 01:30:50,700
it played pretty finished I guess but again it's a beta so some things I saw

1158
01:30:50,700 --> 01:30:55,220
may have been different from the final version but I think for the most part my

1159
01:30:55,220 --> 01:31:02,140
assessment will be on track. And I realize there's people that love In the Groove, and

1160
01:31:02,140 --> 01:31:05,020
I realize there's people that hate it, and hate everything it stands for. So, that being

1161
01:31:05,020 --> 01:31:13,300
said, my review of the game is basically going to be summed up with, it's not as bad as people

1162
01:31:13,300 --> 01:31:19,740
who brag on it would make you think it is. It's not that bad. But, it's not that good

1163
01:31:19,740 --> 01:31:23,860
either. It's not as good as all the people who are talking it up would have you believe.

1164
01:31:23,860 --> 01:31:27,580
So, where should I start off? The bad stuff or the good stuff?

1165
01:31:27,580 --> 01:31:29,180
You want to hear the good stuff first, Loki?

1166
01:31:29,180 --> 01:31:32,460
Start with the good and then go to the honest.

1167
01:31:32,460 --> 01:31:34,140
Okay. Good stuff.

1168
01:31:34,140 --> 01:31:34,940
The mines.

1169
01:31:34,940 --> 01:31:37,740
I thought, now see, this is one of those things that I wouldn't have known unless I

1170
01:31:37,740 --> 01:31:40,720
played the game because I thought mines were a stupid idea to begin with

1171
01:31:40,720 --> 01:31:42,260
until I actually got to play it

1172
01:31:42,260 --> 01:31:44,200
and I thought it was actually really fun.

1173
01:31:44,200 --> 01:31:45,760
The way the step charts were done,

1174
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:49,600
the mines were really smartly placed. It's a neat new feature for the game.

1175
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:51,900
I like the mines. The mines can stay.

1176
01:31:51,900 --> 01:31:58,780
I think as for other step mania maker folks out there, need to lay off the mines, seriously.

1177
01:31:58,780 --> 01:32:02,820
But the folks who did the steps were in the groove, did it smart, and the mines were cool.

1178
01:32:02,820 --> 01:32:05,160
So I like the mine idea.

1179
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:08,660
It seemed like the next logical step to go with the dance game to give us something new

1180
01:32:08,660 --> 01:32:13,740
after free zeroes, so I thought the mine was neat.

1181
01:32:13,740 --> 01:32:17,660
The scoring system, I thought the scoring system was better.

1182
01:32:17,660 --> 01:32:22,820
the Groove scores you on this percentage system, which is basically your score out of 100%

1183
01:32:22,820 --> 01:32:27,060
of the possible, and this is how you can tell that this game is absolutely slanted towards

1184
01:32:27,060 --> 01:32:30,180
people that Perfect Attack, which when you look at the people that work on it, doesn't

1185
01:32:30,180 --> 01:32:35,540
surprise me much, but that's fine. For a Perfect Attacker, you know, it's great. The scoring

1186
01:32:35,540 --> 01:32:40,340
system's pretty smart, and I like the scoring system, it was cool. And just like I said,

1187
01:32:40,340 --> 01:32:45,180
it takes Perfect Attack to the next level. I didn't see a lot of stuff that looked very

1188
01:32:45,180 --> 01:32:49,380
freestyle-able to me, however. So I think if you're more of a freestyler, I don't know.

1189
01:32:49,380 --> 01:32:55,340
I think you may be liking some of the new songs, but it's definitely a Perfect Attackers

1190
01:32:55,340 --> 01:32:57,180
game. That's my assessment.

1191
01:32:57,180 --> 01:33:02,780
Also like the fact that they have the BeatMania chart there where it does, you know, it shows

1192
01:33:02,780 --> 01:33:06,220
like a little graph that you can actually see where you sucked in the song and where

1193
01:33:06,220 --> 01:33:07,440
you were good.

1194
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:13,380
Yeah. Again, things cater to Perfect Attackers. I like that. Again, because now everybody

1195
01:33:13,380 --> 01:33:17,020
is screaming and hollering in the chatroom. As I said, it's a controversial thing. Everybody

1196
01:33:17,020 --> 01:33:20,820
feels very strongly one way or the other. This is just my big fat opinion. Take it,

1197
01:33:20,820 --> 01:33:27,220
leave it, I don't care. This is something I put in my good column. It's not bad for

1198
01:33:27,220 --> 01:33:33,060
a first mix. Considering this is the very first thing they've produced, a dance game

1199
01:33:33,060 --> 01:33:38,140
they've produced, it's really not that bad. And I think if they decide to continue on

1200
01:33:38,140 --> 01:33:43,540
with it, they can only really go up from here. So for a first mix, it's solid, and especially

1201
01:33:43,540 --> 01:33:49,300
when you consider basically this game is fan-made, I don't care how you want to put it, you can't

1202
01:33:49,300 --> 01:33:57,180
ignore that these people were obviously influenced by DDR significantly. It's not a bad game.

1203
01:33:57,180 --> 01:34:02,340
I thought there was more places where you could rank. I just thought the kind of ranking

1204
01:34:02,340 --> 01:34:06,280
system was kind of cool, like you could rank in all these different spots and every song

1205
01:34:06,280 --> 01:34:10,920
had a top ten list, which I thought was kind of fun, so the ranking system was better.

1206
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:14,960
If you're a mode whore, you're in for a treat, because this thing has about a zillion different

1207
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:19,440
modes on it. I didn't even read them all. I'm not a mode whore, I could give a shit,

1208
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:25,480
but if you're a mode whore, you're going to have a blast. Enjoy. The songs were longer,

1209
01:34:25,480 --> 01:34:28,800
which I thought was a good thing, especially as a better workout. The songs were a little

1210
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:32,640
closer to two minutes in length, I think, and I thought it was a little bit better.

1211
01:34:32,640 --> 01:34:33,880
So that was good.

1212
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:34,880
Some songs.

1213
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:37,620
I thought the song list, now see this is one of those things I wouldn't have known unless

1214
01:34:37,620 --> 01:34:38,620
I played the game.

1215
01:34:38,620 --> 01:34:40,860
When I first read the song list I thought, eh, whatever.

1216
01:34:40,860 --> 01:34:42,980
But the song list was actually pretty good.

1217
01:34:42,980 --> 01:34:45,020
I actually liked a lot of the songs.

1218
01:34:45,020 --> 01:34:47,300
I was surprised by some of the ones I'd never heard of.

1219
01:34:47,300 --> 01:34:51,340
One of my favorites was something called Zodiac by Banzai.

1220
01:34:51,340 --> 01:34:54,300
I thought that song was really cool.

1221
01:34:54,300 --> 01:34:57,240
That's something I would like to play on the station sometime.

1222
01:34:57,240 --> 01:35:01,640
Maybe even do like an In the Groove hour of songs or something, I don't know.

1223
01:35:01,640 --> 01:35:03,640
I thought some of the cheesy cover songs...

1224
01:35:03,640 --> 01:35:05,640
Oh, you guys did that last week and I wasn't here?

1225
01:35:05,640 --> 01:35:06,640
Alright, whatever.

1226
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:07,640
I thought some of the cheesy...

1227
01:35:07,640 --> 01:35:09,640
You guys, nothing.

1228
01:35:09,640 --> 01:35:11,640
Well, Loki. Loki and Bradley.

1229
01:35:11,640 --> 01:35:13,640
Guys, not girl and guys.

1230
01:35:13,640 --> 01:35:15,640
Alright, I thought some of the cheesy cover songs really...

1231
01:35:15,640 --> 01:35:19,640
As a person who appreciates the gay music,

1232
01:35:19,640 --> 01:35:22,640
I thought the dance covers of Mouth and Torn were really cute.

1233
01:35:22,640 --> 01:35:23,640
So, I kind of like those songs.

1234
01:35:23,640 --> 01:35:25,640
And then, Missing Heart.

1235
01:35:25,640 --> 01:35:26,640
There was like three Missing Heart songs in there.

1236
01:35:26,640 --> 01:35:28,640
I thought that was awesome, because I like Missing Hearts.

1237
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:30,640
It was cool. What?

1238
01:35:30,640 --> 01:35:34,280
Oh, you have Zodiac. Play a little clip of Zodiac for me, because I like this song.

1239
01:35:34,280 --> 01:35:35,520
Pretty Please.

1240
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:42,520
I actually thought this song was really cool. Play a little bit for me.

1241
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:52,200
This is a real fun one to dance to. I thought this was like the best song in the whole mix.

1242
01:35:52,200 --> 01:35:56,920
At the same time, though, it's probably the song that gets incredibly hoarded out.

1243
01:35:56,920 --> 01:36:00,280
So that's just my guess.

1244
01:36:00,280 --> 01:36:03,060
Alright, that was a little bit of Zodiac. I thought that- I liked that song.

1245
01:36:03,060 --> 01:36:06,560
Uh, okay. That's what I have in the good column. You ready for the bad?

1246
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:07,060
Yeah.

1247
01:36:07,060 --> 01:36:07,560
Alright.

1248
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:12,580
I'm gonna take a lot of shit for this comment, but I don't care.

1249
01:36:12,580 --> 01:36:16,320
This is how I honestly feel. As somebody who's been a fan of DDR for four years,

1250
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:19,440
or, what, three or four years, however long it's been,

1251
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:24,240
I realize these guys are taking a lot of shit for it being a blatant, like,

1252
01:36:24,240 --> 01:36:26,720
for people saying it's too much like DDR.

1253
01:36:26,720 --> 01:36:29,480
It is too much like DDR. It is a blatant DDR ripoff.

1254
01:36:29,480 --> 01:36:31,320
I'm sorry, that's how I felt.

1255
01:36:31,320 --> 01:36:35,160
I felt like I was playing DDR. I realize there's new stuff and they're trying to be different.

1256
01:36:35,160 --> 01:36:36,520
My only, my only

1257
01:36:36,520 --> 01:36:38,800
suggestion is that it's not different enough.

1258
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:39,720
I think,

1259
01:36:39,720 --> 01:36:44,680
now there's this whole argument going on about is it legal, is it not, is it legal, is it not.

1260
01:36:44,680 --> 01:36:48,120
I don't know where that stands. I don't care. It's not my issue. What, Logan?

1261
01:36:48,120 --> 01:36:50,240
It is DDR. It's only changed

1262
01:36:50,240 --> 01:36:53,800
from DDR enough to make it not,

1263
01:36:53,800 --> 01:36:54,940
so they can't get sued.

1264
01:36:54,940 --> 01:36:58,860
That's pretty much what it is. It's basically, that's it. They only changed, they would have

1265
01:36:58,860 --> 01:37:04,140
left it the same if they could. And also I think that since it's not an actually re-engineered

1266
01:37:04,140 --> 01:37:09,660
DDR that it's, you know, ground up, they can't say that they stole the engine. But honestly,

1267
01:37:09,660 --> 01:37:14,820
I think if Konami wanted to sue, and I don't know where this thing stands legally, but

1268
01:37:14,820 --> 01:37:20,580
I think Konami does have a step to stand on. It is way too much like DDR. It's not different

1269
01:37:20,580 --> 01:37:28,740
enough. I felt like I was playing DDR, different mix. I thought the interface was smooth. The

1270
01:37:28,740 --> 01:37:32,140
The interface was very smooth, but I thought it was very dry.

1271
01:37:32,140 --> 01:37:34,740
The backgrounds were boring, and the arrows were ugly.

1272
01:37:34,740 --> 01:37:36,140
It was an ugly game.

1273
01:37:36,140 --> 01:37:38,180
It was not a pretty game to look at.

1274
01:37:38,180 --> 01:37:40,620
It was an ugly interface, basically.

1275
01:37:40,620 --> 01:37:41,620
What?

1276
01:37:41,620 --> 01:37:44,940
Compared to Feet of Fury, how did those arrows look?

1277
01:37:44,940 --> 01:37:47,220
Okay, compared to Feet of Fury, it looked great.

1278
01:37:47,220 --> 01:37:52,140
But honestly, part of what attracted me to DDR in the beginning was that very saccharine,

1279
01:37:52,140 --> 01:37:56,620
sugary look to it with all the lights and the cutesy little characters and stuff.

1280
01:37:56,620 --> 01:37:58,620
I think In The Groove is ugly.

1281
01:37:58,620 --> 01:38:02,160
Um, sorry, but that's just my opinion.

1282
01:38:02,160 --> 01:38:04,020
It was not pleasant to look at.

1283
01:38:04,020 --> 01:38:09,060
Everything was kind of these greys and blues and whatever.

1284
01:38:09,060 --> 01:38:10,780
This is the thing that bugged me most about the game.

1285
01:38:10,780 --> 01:38:12,800
And I realize it bugs a lot of people too as well.

1286
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:15,780
And I have played it, and I did get forced to do this in some songs.

1287
01:38:15,780 --> 01:38:20,040
I think hand plants are the stupidest thing in the entire game.

1288
01:38:20,040 --> 01:38:21,040
And the game acknowledges-

1289
01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:22,040
They make you hand plants?

1290
01:38:22,040 --> 01:38:23,040
Yes.

1291
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:24,040
But they're forced-

1292
01:38:24,040 --> 01:38:26,420
That went up like years ago.

1293
01:38:26,420 --> 01:38:30,680
can turn them off. I was not able to, there were so many modes I couldn't even see

1294
01:38:30,680 --> 01:38:32,300
where to turn it off, but that's fine.

1295
01:38:32,300 --> 01:38:36,240
I understand you can turn them off. My point is they are retarded in the first

1296
01:38:36,240 --> 01:38:36,700
place.

1297
01:38:36,700 --> 01:38:41,180
They are really retarded and they were not put smart, like

1298
01:38:41,180 --> 01:38:44,460
I was playing songs and suddenly these hamplants would come up and I just kinda

1299
01:38:44,460 --> 01:38:45,060
sighed.

1300
01:38:45,060 --> 01:38:49,080
I did not feel like throwing my back out to hit them. That's not dancing,

1301
01:38:49,080 --> 01:38:52,460
that is monkey flailing is when you do those hamplants.

1302
01:38:52,460 --> 01:38:55,660
You know what? And I realize it's borderline dancing at first, but the hamplants were stupid.

1303
01:38:55,660 --> 01:39:02,660
The thing you said about in the group so far, even the good stuff, doesn't sound enough to even give a rat's ass about it, honestly.

1304
01:39:02,660 --> 01:39:15,660
I honestly think that everybody who is a fan of Bomani should try it once. It's different, it's worth a look, but basically my thing is form your own opinion. Play it, form your own opinion.

1305
01:39:15,660 --> 01:39:21,660
Of course if someone was to play like a really ass of game- of dancing games, there was that Jaleco one.

1306
01:39:21,660 --> 01:39:22,660
Yeah.

1307
01:39:22,660 --> 01:39:28,660
With the- what was that one? Stepping Stage. Was that it? No way.

1308
01:39:28,660 --> 01:39:30,660
Yeah, I think that- Stepping Stage. Or Stepping Selection.

1309
01:39:30,660 --> 01:39:32,660
Stepping Selection. There was that one.

1310
01:39:35,660 --> 01:39:37,660
No game is as bad as that.

1311
01:39:37,660 --> 01:39:45,760
and I realize it's not really dancing in the first place but the hamplants it's

1312
01:39:45,760 --> 01:39:48,880
what I hate about pump it up and it's what I hate about in the group sorry

1313
01:39:48,880 --> 01:39:56,260
that's just I hated it um I thought this is gonna sound really cold but I kind of

1314
01:39:56,260 --> 01:39:59,460
don't care I thought it was kind of stupid that the step chart makers had a

1315
01:39:59,460 --> 01:40:03,740
credit and it was I'm not talking about something like it's in the credits of

1316
01:40:03,740 --> 01:40:06,580
the game I'm talking about when you select a song and you go into the song

1317
01:40:06,580 --> 01:40:12,640
It shows, in the same font size and type, in the bottom corner, song name, song artist,

1318
01:40:12,640 --> 01:40:14,280
and the step chart artist.

1319
01:40:14,280 --> 01:40:18,960
Well, the effort went into making the step chart, so you should have some credit.

1320
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:20,640
I think the credit can be given at the end of the game.

1321
01:40:20,640 --> 01:40:24,040
This is the part that kind of bugged me, is that in most songs that I played, it was the

1322
01:40:24,040 --> 01:40:25,920
same person every time.

1323
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:27,560
Did that person put a lot of work in the game?

1324
01:40:27,560 --> 01:40:31,040
Sure, I'm not going to debate that, but the thing is, I don't think that person deserves

1325
01:40:31,040 --> 01:40:35,160
as much credit as the person who created the song, for God's sake, the artist and the song

1326
01:40:35,160 --> 01:40:36,160
you're dancing to.

1327
01:40:36,160 --> 01:40:39,200
I realize it's a little thing and I'm probably going to get shit for that comment, but I

1328
01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:40,200
don't care.

1329
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:44,080
I just, it's something that struck me as kind of like, I kind of went, that's kind of dorky.

1330
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:49,120
It's totally something though I would expect from the sim scene.

1331
01:40:49,120 --> 01:40:52,680
Oh.

1332
01:40:52,680 --> 01:40:54,880
If I was a beginner, I wouldn't want to play in the groove.

1333
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:56,740
It has a really nice tutorial mode.

1334
01:40:56,740 --> 01:40:57,740
I'll give it that.

1335
01:40:57,740 --> 01:41:02,160
It's probably better than anything DDR has for beginners, but kind of looking at it,

1336
01:41:02,160 --> 01:41:05,120
if I was new and I was walking into the arcade and I was looking at it, I wouldn't want to

1337
01:41:05,120 --> 01:41:11,760
play it. But the interface is totally turned off. When I was playing, the CD skipped, and

1338
01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:16,960
it caused the whole game to skip, and it caused the arrows to skip, kind of like the Ultramix

1339
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:22,080
glitch that some of the service packs have. It's very similar to that effect, and since

1340
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:27,480
this game is so heavily based on Perfect Attack, that is a big no-no. That was a big no-no.

1341
01:41:27,480 --> 01:41:33,160
CD skipped. Why the fuck is it running off of a CD? It's got a fucking hard drive in

1342
01:41:33,160 --> 01:41:48,160
I don't know if it's a CD skip or what it is, but it was like a CD skip, and it was kind of bad.

1343
01:41:48,160 --> 01:42:13,160
Lastly, a lot of the people who are big fans of the game say that the step charts are innovative and the step charts do all these great new things. I didn't see it. I wasn't feeling it. With the exception of the mines and the hand plants, I thought that the step charts were basically what you'd see in DDR, which kind of brings me back to my first point where basically in the groove is just another DDR.

1344
01:42:13,160 --> 01:42:27,160
Um, what I would just say is Food Mix did it better. And if you want to do the interface, Technolize did it better. I'm sorry, you put Food Mix songs and steps with Technolize's theme, I'm sorry you've got a better game. That's what it comes down to.

1345
01:42:27,160 --> 01:42:36,160
Well, that's one point, but I will agree with you that Food Mix's steps were better. But Food Mix isn't an arcade game either, and I'm not talking about Food Mix right now.

1346
01:42:36,160 --> 01:42:39,960
now so alright there's the bad so I gave you good and I gave you bad my final

1347
01:42:39,960 --> 01:42:44,800
assessment is that everybody should try it at least once but I honestly don't

1348
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:48,640
see this taking over DDR because here's my other point while I was in the arcade

1349
01:42:48,640 --> 01:42:54,460
I just kind of observed in the arcade as well while I was in the arcade people

1350
01:42:54,460 --> 01:42:58,680
were playing DDR non-stop people came up and were playing DDR non-stop I was one

1351
01:42:58,680 --> 01:43:02,080
of three people the whole time I was there that played in the groove I watched

1352
01:43:02,080 --> 01:43:05,620
in my time there DDR make twice as much money as in the groove a two-year-old

1353
01:43:05,620 --> 01:43:11,580
old game. That's the reality, as far as I can see. You can't debate that.

1354
01:43:11,580 --> 01:43:15,660
Here's another thing, too. Your average DDR mix, and I understand this is brand new hardware

1355
01:43:15,660 --> 01:43:19,460
that they're adding to the scene and everything like that. Your average DDR mix costs about

1356
01:43:19,460 --> 01:43:23,700
$800 to upgrade. If you were going to take a third mix machine, upgrade it to extreme,

1357
01:43:23,700 --> 01:43:30,900
it'd be about $800. This sucker costs over $2,000 to upgrade for an arcade. An arcade

1358
01:43:30,900 --> 01:43:34,980
it's risky you know adding this I mean cuz you know TDR extreme sure it may not

1359
01:43:34,980 --> 01:43:38,100
be pulling in the crowds it was before but you've already got that game it's

1360
01:43:38,100 --> 01:43:41,760
already been paying for it and it's already it's still making money it's got

1361
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:47,580
a fan base it's got a fan base already so you're gonna you know risk $2,000 on

1362
01:43:47,580 --> 01:43:52,420
this brand new mix which you know it's a cool idea if you have got an arcade that

1363
01:43:52,420 --> 01:43:55,860
does a lot of revenue and you know and you want to bring one of these in go for

1364
01:43:55,860 --> 01:44:03,540
but you know it's kind of pricey kind of pricey but i'm sure that pays for all the licensed songs

1365
01:44:03,540 --> 01:44:09,620
but even still here's the other thing i said you can have all in-house artists and it will still

1366
01:44:09,620 --> 01:44:14,740
be good this still will be good it's just that's been proven right there with food mix i know that's

1367
01:44:14,740 --> 01:44:20,180
not an arcade game but it's all in-house artists and the songs are really good that's what it comes

1368
01:44:20,180 --> 01:44:26,820
down to. Songs are good, steps were innovative, the backgrounds were awesome. They put more

1369
01:44:26,820 --> 01:44:30,580
effort into it. I'm sorry.

1370
01:44:30,580 --> 01:44:35,140
I don't know. I'm not talking about food mix. I want to finish up In the Groove, basically.

1371
01:44:35,140 --> 01:44:37,940
I don't want to leave it on such a sour note because I did talk about all that stuff. Again,

1372
01:44:37,940 --> 01:44:43,380
I just want to reiterate, it's the first mix. I think it can only get better. For a first

1373
01:44:43,380 --> 01:44:49,700
mixed it's not bad but to me I and this is kind of my final say on it I I left

1374
01:44:49,700 --> 01:44:53,180
this playing this game the same taste in my mouth that I get when I play pump it

1375
01:44:53,180 --> 01:44:57,220
up and I don't mean physically but I mean basically the way I kind of react

1376
01:44:57,220 --> 01:45:00,260
to pump it up a sign like oh you know cool they have a pump it up I am maybe

1377
01:45:00,260 --> 01:45:04,260
I'll play that for fun once in a while that's exactly how I feel about in the

1378
01:45:04,260 --> 01:45:09,460
groove oh it's cute I'll play it once in a while for fun but it's not a DDR killer

1379
01:45:09,460 --> 01:45:14,940
in my eyes in it in any shape or form that's how I feel about it

1380
01:45:14,940 --> 01:45:18,700
all right but I realize people people feel passionately in one way or the

1381
01:45:18,700 --> 01:45:26,580
other I know it's okay but it's just a game people all right you know I would

1382
01:45:26,580 --> 01:45:32,020
try it to say I have because I'm not usually one to to you know poop on

1383
01:45:32,020 --> 01:45:35,980
something unless I've actually played it but everything I've heard on it and

1384
01:45:35,980 --> 01:45:40,540
everything that I've seen so far just doesn't excite me I'm gonna open up the

1385
01:45:40,540 --> 01:45:43,860
Skype line maybe somebody wants to say something about it but I'm not gonna

1386
01:45:43,860 --> 01:45:46,740
have it open very long because I want to get to the cage match because we're

1387
01:45:46,740 --> 01:45:52,240
starting to run late but yeah if I do want to allow you know if there's

1388
01:45:52,240 --> 01:45:55,540
somebody that has a counterpoint I want to give him a chance to speak back so at

with the show and give us a shout on the Skype line and let's see what you have

1391
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:09,920
to say while I set up for the cage match here so I guess in the groove has gone

1392
01:46:09,920 --> 01:46:13,820
gold or whatever and they're shipping to different arcades and what have you oh

1393
01:46:13,820 --> 01:46:18,200
we're getting a call from our old buddy Jason what's up Jason of course it's me

1394
01:46:18,200 --> 01:46:22,820
of course of course but I love hearing from Jason what's up Jason you got

1395
01:46:22,820 --> 01:46:26,080
something you wanna say about in the groove there's a few things that are

1396
01:46:26,080 --> 01:46:29,500
always on my mind about this all right one little side note is something you

1397
01:46:29,500 --> 01:46:35,760
said earlier, Roxor Games made, basically they took the number one game that comes with

1398
01:46:35,760 --> 01:46:42,040
most Linux distributions called Tux Racer. It's basically a little racer with the Penguin

1399
01:46:42,040 --> 01:46:48,080
Tux mascot for Linux and they put it in an arcade game and shipped it out to arcades.

1400
01:46:48,080 --> 01:46:53,000
We actually have one out here. I never knew that. Cracker Jacks. That's kind of funny.

1401
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:58,000
If you go to the Roxor Games company website, there's two things, Tux Racer and The Groove.

1402
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:03,560
I guess so I guess you'll kind of leave it at that point then all right yeah

1403
01:47:03,560 --> 01:47:07,960
anyways all right there's the two things that are kind of hanging me up about all

1404
01:47:07,960 --> 01:47:14,120
this is that first of all the songs I still want to hear all the songs I still

1405
01:47:14,120 --> 01:47:17,240
want a sound truck I still want to get all the songs I do want to play the game

1406
01:47:17,240 --> 01:47:24,880
but already the variety is you know I hear USA a nice a nice group of songs

1407
01:47:24,880 --> 01:47:27,280
songs, but all along a similar line.

1408
01:47:27,280 --> 01:47:32,560
I kinda liked the song list, and that's one of those things I wouldn't have realized unless

1409
01:47:32,560 --> 01:47:36,320
I actually played the game, so I'm glad I'm opening my mouth now after I played the game

1410
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:40,080
and saying to the song list, it's not that bad. It was kind of fun, and there were actually

1411
01:47:40,080 --> 01:47:42,600
some really, really good songs in there, so that's one thing.

1412
01:47:42,600 --> 01:47:47,420
I mean, there are, I still want to play it. But yeah, the main two things that are on

1413
01:47:47,420 --> 01:47:51,640
my mind, I don't know how many people I've told this to, maybe two or three people.

1414
01:47:51,640 --> 01:47:55,640
We are about to tell two more, because that's how many people we have listening right now.

1415
01:47:55,640 --> 01:47:56,640
Two more.

1416
01:47:56,640 --> 01:48:09,640
The arcade manager, something to do with the arcade hardware manager for Rockzor, was standing at the corner of the Konami booth at E3, and I was just kind of watching everybody play Xtreme, and we had a nice little discussion.

1417
01:48:09,640 --> 01:48:12,640
I remember that guy, I saw him too.

1418
01:48:12,640 --> 01:48:19,280
Yeah, and it's the two things are hanging me up is that they're gonna go for a copy of the bimani series

1419
01:48:20,180 --> 01:48:26,700
He said they have eventual plans to start cloning the other games starting with beat mania will most likely be their second

1420
01:48:27,220 --> 01:48:31,180
It's a good. It's a nice idea because it gets more games in the u.s.

1421
01:48:31,180 --> 01:48:36,980
It finally brings these here legitimately and with a variety. That's a good thing at the same time

1422
01:48:36,980 --> 01:48:41,420
It's this little company undertaking this whole task of all of this

1423
01:48:41,420 --> 01:48:47,420
I don't want to say they're just going to lose, but, you know, this isn't an easy thing to take.

1424
01:48:47,420 --> 01:48:56,420
You know, it's going to be tough. If they release some kind of Beatmania clone over here, it's going to be tough, because they're going to beat Konami to the punch, but at the same time...

1425
01:48:56,420 --> 01:49:07,420
I don't know. It's a difficult situation. It's a really difficult situation, but I think if Konami has issue with what's going on here, they need to do something about it now before it does get out of control.

1426
01:49:07,420 --> 01:49:12,020
But maybe they can't do anything. I mean, maybe that's the sad part of it, is that maybe they can't do anything.

1427
01:49:12,020 --> 01:49:15,020
Well, Konami US no longer has an arcade division anyway.

1428
01:49:17,420 --> 01:49:22,020
That's... Well, they can still... The whole thing about that article was that they can't...

1429
01:49:22,020 --> 01:49:26,020
They don't produce the machines here, but they can still get it through a third-party distributor.

1430
01:49:26,020 --> 01:49:28,420
And the bookkeeping is done in Japan. Big deal.

1431
01:49:30,220 --> 01:49:34,620
I do want to play it. If we ever got a machine here, I would play it. I know I would.

1432
01:49:34,620 --> 01:49:39,620
I want to play it, but I just don't know what to expect from it yet.

1433
01:49:39,620 --> 01:49:42,620
I think big arcades with a lot of Bahmani games should get in the groove.

1434
01:49:42,620 --> 01:49:44,620
It's just kind of a fun little alternative.

1435
01:49:44,620 --> 01:49:51,620
And actually, I think I can see, because I've heard that this place that I went to has these big Friday night tournaments and stuff,

1436
01:49:51,620 --> 01:49:55,620
and it does seem like it's a very tournament-friendly game. I'm kind of not surprised by that.

1437
01:49:55,620 --> 01:50:05,620
Supposedly like 40 people were already on the reserve list as soon as the public release, the 1.0 gold release came out.

1438
01:50:05,620 --> 01:50:18,620
Because people want a new DDR arcade mix, but that's the whole thing, is that again, people want a new DDR arcade mix, so they order In the Groove, yet In the Groove is supposedly not like DDR.

1439
01:50:18,620 --> 01:50:26,300
are because we don't want a lawsuit. I don't get it. Whatever. I think big arcades that

1440
01:50:26,300 --> 01:50:30,900
have lots of bimani games should get it just as an alternative, but I wouldn't recommend

1441
01:50:30,900 --> 01:50:31,900
the whole world jumping on it.

1442
01:50:31,900 --> 01:50:34,700
Instead of having three, four, or five extreme machines all in a row?

1443
01:50:34,700 --> 01:50:39,180
Yeah, exactly. There's no need for two extreme machines. Get a fourth plus and then get in

1444
01:50:39,180 --> 01:50:40,180
the group.

1445
01:50:40,180 --> 01:50:41,180
Fifth! Fifth!

1446
01:50:41,180 --> 01:50:43,940
Alright. Or fifth. Get a fourth plus or fifth and then get in the group.

1447
01:50:43,940 --> 01:50:45,940
Fourth plus. Fourth plus.

1448
01:50:45,940 --> 01:50:48,940
That's it for now.

1449
01:50:48,940 --> 01:50:49,940
That's about it.

1450
01:50:49,940 --> 01:50:51,940
Is there anything else you want to say, Jason?

1451
01:50:51,940 --> 01:50:57,940
Console games are going to make this thing very interesting when they finally decide to start working on those.

1452
01:50:57,940 --> 01:51:02,940
I'm going to be brave and say it doesn't happen.

1453
01:51:02,940 --> 01:51:09,940
Obviously this isn't the authority, but ITG FreeGuardie has locked forums in place for whenever that actually starts.

1454
01:51:09,940 --> 01:51:11,940
It is on their to-do list.

1455
01:51:11,940 --> 01:51:15,940
Feel free to prove me wrong, but I'm gonna say right now it's not gonna happen.

1456
01:51:15,940 --> 01:51:17,940
Feel free to prove me wrong, it's not gonna happen.

1457
01:51:17,940 --> 01:51:19,940
Give it a few years, we'll see what goes from here.

1458
01:51:19,940 --> 01:51:27,940
Okay, now, supposedly, supposedly, that they have some sort of encryption thing that they did with this whole game on the hard drive on this thing,

1459
01:51:27,940 --> 01:51:34,940
where you couldn't, you know, say, I don't know, because it is basically StepMania, you couldn't, I don't know, add songs to it.

1460
01:51:34,940 --> 01:51:37,940
Supposedly, they have this, something tells me that they don't.

1461
01:51:37,940 --> 01:51:41,340
And I think that all you're gonna have to do is buy this game and be like,

1462
01:51:41,340 --> 01:51:44,940
Hey, you know what? I don't want to buy your next upgrade for this thing,

1463
01:51:44,940 --> 01:51:47,540
because they weren't gonna do downloadable updates or something like that.

1464
01:51:47,540 --> 01:51:49,540
That was one of the things I think they were talking about.

1465
01:51:49,540 --> 01:51:55,640
And, um, so basically you could say, you know, I like this DDR Extreme machine I have here,

1466
01:51:55,640 --> 01:51:59,140
but what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take all the songs from DDR Extreme

1467
01:51:59,140 --> 01:52:01,440
that are already available for download on the internet,

1468
01:52:01,440 --> 01:52:05,140
and I'm gonna put them in this, you know, um, In The Groove thing,

1469
01:52:05,140 --> 01:52:10,140
and I'm going to call it In The Groove Plus.

1470
01:52:10,140 --> 01:52:14,140
And then I'm going to sell it for $3,000 on the internet.

1471
01:52:14,140 --> 01:52:15,140
You know what? You know what's interesting?

1472
01:52:15,140 --> 01:52:18,140
And this is something I completely forgot to say about In The Groove.

1473
01:52:18,140 --> 01:52:22,140
I think what's going to be interesting about it is that basically, yeah,

1474
01:52:22,140 --> 01:52:26,140
the irony of the situation is that everybody's going to pirate it to play on StepMania

1475
01:52:26,140 --> 01:52:28,140
and then they won't bother with In The Groove.

1476
01:52:28,140 --> 01:52:31,140
That's the irony of the whole thing, I think.

1477
01:52:31,140 --> 01:52:34,140
I think that's how most, honestly, that's how most people are playing it right now.

1478
01:52:34,140 --> 01:52:42,140
Even better, there's people out there bootlegging fucking DDR Extreme. What's going to stop them from fucking bootlegging this thing? It's going to be even easier.

1479
01:52:42,140 --> 01:52:44,140
And they'll be able to make it even better.

1480
01:52:44,140 --> 01:52:49,140
That's going to hurt the smaller companies too. The less backing a company has, the more it's going to hurt them.

1481
01:52:49,140 --> 01:52:55,140
Alright. I'm digging myself deep enough hole as it is here with the group fans.

1482
01:52:55,140 --> 01:52:59,140
We'll just end this and move along great and move back to the rest of the normal show.

1483
01:52:59,140 --> 01:53:00,140
Sounds good.

1484
01:53:00,140 --> 01:53:03,140
Alright, thanks Jason for calling.

1485
01:53:03,140 --> 01:53:11,820
Alright. I am offering a cordial invitation to anybody that worked on In The Groove or

1486
01:53:11,820 --> 01:53:17,100
anybody that, you know, worked on In The Groove or anybody that had something to do with the

1487
01:53:17,100 --> 01:53:22,980
making of this game. I invite you to come on this show. We will set up a phone interview

1488
01:53:22,980 --> 01:53:27,020
or something. Come on this show, talk about your game. I would love to know what you guys

1489
01:53:27,020 --> 01:53:31,740
have to say about this. Honestly, come tell me I'm wrong. Tell me there's going to be

1490
01:53:31,740 --> 01:53:35,460
a home mix. I am perfectly fine with this, but I want to hear it from the official horse's

1491
01:53:35,460 --> 01:53:42,820
mouth. So, open invite. I'll be nice. Come to California, we'll buy you lunch. That's

1492
01:53:42,820 --> 01:53:47,060
about all we can afford in our budget. A nice McDonald's lunch for our guests. But, you

1493
01:53:47,060 --> 01:53:54,700
know, we can open it up to you. Let's take one more call. You're on Orange Lounge. Hello?

1494
01:53:54,700 --> 01:54:00,120
Hey, your friendly neighborhood legend is Zaku. Hey, Zaku, what's up? I already played

1495
01:54:00,120 --> 01:54:04,480
in the groove because obviously because you know I live in the city and Port Authority

1496
01:54:04,480 --> 01:54:10,520
bus terminals and it was in the groove place what'd you think so far so good I mean the

1497
01:54:10,520 --> 01:54:15,800
songs are unique for the fact that this is probably the only alternative left our last

1498
01:54:15,800 --> 01:54:21,720
hope because you know we're hearing we're hearing word that this might be it that you

1499
01:54:21,720 --> 01:54:26,520
know DDR in the arcades might be on its last limb people are gonna get sick and tired hold

1500
01:54:26,520 --> 01:54:30,800
Well, I think somebody came in the room.

1501
01:54:30,800 --> 01:54:36,240
Hold on a sec. Clean your room! No, someone's asking for my roommate, but anyways,

1502
01:54:36,240 --> 01:54:43,000
yeah, DDR, yeah, people have been playing Extreme for almost two years. They're gonna get cranky and sick and tired.

1503
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:46,480
But that's the thing! That's the thing, Zaku, is that I was at this place and people were

1504
01:54:46,480 --> 01:54:47,040
playing

1505
01:54:47,040 --> 01:54:51,280
DDR Extreme more than they were playing in the group. Now I realize it's just one day

1506
01:54:51,280 --> 01:54:54,680
and I realize it wasn't a tournament night or anything, but it was

1507
01:54:54,680 --> 01:54:59,120
Sunday afternoon a random Sunday afternoon in the arcade and there were

1508
01:54:59,120 --> 01:55:02,300
more people and it wasn't the same people playing DDR the whole time there

1509
01:55:02,300 --> 01:55:07,820
were more people playing DDR it's not always it's always gonna be I'm sorry

1510
01:55:07,820 --> 01:55:11,500
hold on okay it's not gonna always be tournament night at these other arcades

1511
01:55:11,500 --> 01:55:14,900
if this isn't doing good in this arcade it's not gonna do good in another arcade

1512
01:55:14,900 --> 01:55:20,540
maybe it depends it depends though I mean one you have in the groove something

1513
01:55:20,540 --> 01:55:25,140
you know more net you know national because you know it's made here but you

1514
01:55:25,140 --> 01:55:29,500
know at the same time it's not Konami because the timing window is huge you

1515
01:55:29,500 --> 01:55:33,180
large enough to drive you know an 18-wheeler through it and I and believe

1516
01:55:33,180 --> 01:55:36,500
me that's true I know you already know you know this guy

1517
01:55:36,500 --> 01:55:41,460
secondly I mean I don't it really depends it's gonna be hard for you know

1518
01:55:41,460 --> 01:55:45,460
the transitions if is that a princess phone ringing in the background you know

1519
01:55:45,460 --> 01:55:50,180
makes it official that this is that is that a princess phone my phone as my

1520
01:55:50,180 --> 01:55:57,020
roommate's phone all right your roommate has a princess phone your roommate has a

1521
01:55:57,020 --> 01:56:03,580
cute phone it's adorable sorry Zaku finish your thought cuz we are your cage

1522
01:56:03,580 --> 01:56:09,460
match yeah just you just left this phone right there but what finish your thought

1523
01:56:09,460 --> 01:56:12,780
that go we gotta go to cage match soon what's well pretty much it I mean this

1524
01:56:12,780 --> 01:56:18,340
is the up all right in other words let's just put it to sum it all up alternative

1525
01:56:18,340 --> 01:56:25,340
In the group equals alternative for those who have been playing DDR3 for the longest ever since it first came out.

1526
01:56:25,340 --> 01:56:26,340
I'll agree with you there.

1527
01:56:26,340 --> 01:56:27,340
This is transitional.

1528
01:56:27,340 --> 01:56:28,340
I'll agree with you there.

1529
01:56:28,340 --> 01:56:29,340
Period.

1530
01:56:29,340 --> 01:56:31,340
Alright. Have a good one, Zaku.

1531
01:56:31,340 --> 01:56:32,340
Alright. Later.

1532
01:56:32,340 --> 01:56:33,340
Later.

1533
01:56:33,340 --> 01:56:38,340
And that's the funny thing. I agree. It's an alternative, not a replacement for DDR.

1534
01:56:38,340 --> 01:56:45,340
But here's the funny thing is that, you know, I say it at the same time, it's not a replacement for DDR, but yet it is a ripoff of DDR.

1535
01:56:45,340 --> 01:56:49,340
Alright, anyway, uh, before I get- say some more things to get me in trouble...

1536
01:56:49,340 --> 01:56:54,340
You know what? I didn't like UltraMix at first, either, and it suddenly became my favorite mix.

1537
01:56:54,340 --> 01:56:57,340
Home mix, of all. So...

1538
01:56:57,340 --> 01:57:01,340
My opinion could change later on, but for right now, that's how I feel.

1539
01:57:01,340 --> 01:57:05,340
Whatever. It's not all about me, anyway. As much as I like to think it is.

1540
01:57:05,340 --> 01:57:08,340
Hi, guys! How are the rest of you guys doing?

1541
01:57:08,340 --> 01:57:11,340
Some of you guys look like you're falling asleep, or what?

1542
01:57:11,340 --> 01:57:15,100
Sorry, I'll shut up about it in the group now.

1543
01:57:15,100 --> 01:57:18,220
I want to get to the cage match.

1544
01:57:18,220 --> 01:57:22,220
Oh yeah, a cage match. I think it's cool. Yeah, let's get to the cage match. I miss the cage match.

1545
01:57:22,220 --> 01:57:27,620
Alright, the way the Orange Lounge Radio cage match works, we play three songs for you

1546
01:57:27,620 --> 01:57:29,420
guys. You guys pick your favorite

1547
01:57:29,420 --> 01:57:32,900
and it goes into rotation all week long here on Orange Lounge Radio. We didn't do a

1548
01:57:32,900 --> 01:57:35,020
cage match last week, so let's rewind

1549
01:57:35,020 --> 01:57:39,180
two weeks ago. Jamie surprised us all when she beat Echo Image

1550
01:57:39,180 --> 01:57:46,380
and something Loki had picked to win it with this ska remix of Lupin the third.

1551
01:57:46,380 --> 01:57:48,180
That was her pick and it won.

1552
01:57:48,180 --> 01:57:49,380
Like beat rock.

1553
01:57:49,380 --> 01:57:51,380
Like beat, okay, beat rock.

1554
01:57:51,380 --> 01:57:54,180
Although it is the Tokyo Paradise Ska Orchestra.

1555
01:57:54,180 --> 01:57:56,980
It sounded more like something you hear like in a little moment.

1556
01:57:56,980 --> 01:58:01,080
All right, granted, it's now two weeks by default.

1557
01:58:01,080 --> 01:58:04,480
It's the winner two weeks in a row and it's going to go for three.

1558
01:58:04,480 --> 01:58:05,380
And here it is.

1559
01:58:05,380 --> 01:58:08,580
You only get to hear a clip of it because it was the last winner.

1560
01:58:08,580 --> 01:58:11,260
So here's a clip of song number one you can vote for tonight.

1561
01:58:11,260 --> 01:58:15,060

1563
01:58:16,060 --> 01:58:20,380
Here's song number one you can vote for tonight, Tokyo Paradise Ska Orchestra, themed from

1564
01:58:20,380 --> 01:58:27,380
from Lubin III.

1565
01:59:50,380 --> 02:00:08,740
Song number one in tonight's cage match, Tokyo Paradise Ska Orchestra with a theme from Lupin

1566
02:00:08,740 --> 02:00:09,740
the third.

1567
02:00:09,740 --> 02:00:10,740
It's Lupin the Lupin.

1568
02:00:10,740 --> 02:00:11,740
Lupin the third.

1569
02:00:11,740 --> 02:00:12,740
Because it's French.

1570
02:00:12,740 --> 02:00:13,740
I know.

1571
02:00:13,740 --> 02:00:14,740
Lupin.

1572
02:00:14,740 --> 02:00:15,740
I like Lupin.

1573
02:00:15,740 --> 02:00:17,740
We're going to watch some Lupin.

1574
02:00:17,740 --> 02:00:18,740
Alright.

1575
02:00:18,740 --> 02:00:30,740
My turn, this is my pick for tonight's cage match. I'm actually being lazy and just picking the song that I was going to play last week, because there was supposed to be a cage match last week, but you know, things change, whatever.

1576
02:00:30,740 --> 02:00:42,740
So I'm just gonna pick the same song. And I actually had written a little spiel for you guys to read, so I'm just gonna go ahead and read that spiel now. Let's see, ooh, let's see who's at the door.

1577
02:00:42,740 --> 02:00:44,740
Hello! Jonas is here. Alright, anyway.

1578
02:00:44,740 --> 02:00:49,740
This is the little thing I was gonna have Jamie read last week before the cage match.

1579
02:00:49,740 --> 02:00:50,740
Except I was dead.

1580
02:00:50,740 --> 02:00:51,740
That's alright.

1581
02:00:51,740 --> 02:00:54,740
Since you cunts voted out Echo Image last week,

1582
02:00:54,740 --> 02:00:58,740
I was going to pick Britney or some shit to torture you with in my absence.

1583
02:00:58,740 --> 02:01:01,740
But this pretty kickass trance song came to my attention,

1584
02:01:01,740 --> 02:01:05,740
and Jamie, I know how much you love trance.

1585
02:01:05,740 --> 02:01:08,740
But it kinda sounds like tack in one part of it, so just listen to it.

1586
02:01:08,740 --> 02:01:09,740
Tackoo!

1587
02:01:09,740 --> 02:01:13,380
And also I know Loki has a total hard-on for this artist

1588
02:01:13,380 --> 02:01:17,840
So I thought I'd beat him to the punch by putting this in tonight's cage match. It's also kind of long

1589
02:01:17,840 --> 02:01:23,160
So deal with it. This is song number two. Oh, no Ken with the Jory. Enjoy

1590
02:03:17,840 --> 02:03:22,840
a

1591
02:03:22,840 --> 02:03:27,840
a

1592
02:03:27,840 --> 02:03:32,840
a

1593
02:03:32,840 --> 02:03:34,840
a

1594
02:03:34,840 --> 02:03:39,840
a

1595
02:03:39,840 --> 02:03:44,840
a

1596
02:06:14,840 --> 02:06:16,840
I don't know what you're going to do

1597
02:07:44,840 --> 02:08:00,080
All right, song number two in tonight's cage match, Ono Ken with the Joré.

1598
02:08:00,080 --> 02:08:01,080
Jamie!

1599
02:08:01,080 --> 02:08:02,080
I really liked it.

1600
02:08:02,080 --> 02:08:03,080
It wasn't...

1601
02:08:03,080 --> 02:08:09,640
The trance I am sick of is the cookie cutter, repetitive, crap trance that people...

1602
02:08:09,640 --> 02:08:14,760
Feel the beat, feel the beat, feel the beat, feel the beat, feel the beat.

1603
02:08:14,760 --> 02:08:22,760
That was, that was a lot more, what's the word I'm thinking of, progressive sounding, it was, that was more what I liked.

1604
02:08:22,760 --> 02:08:24,760
You liked it, that's an upset.

1605
02:08:24,760 --> 02:08:25,760
Well yeah, I liked it.

1606
02:08:25,760 --> 02:08:27,760
It's a trance that you like.

1607
02:08:27,760 --> 02:08:37,760
But, cage match wise, it was a little long. I mean, I would listen to it all the time otherwise. I mean, that would be one of my songs on repeat, I would have to give it that high of a rating.

1608
02:08:37,760 --> 02:08:45,760
However, because of Link, for cage match purposes, I would give it an 8, and this would be what I would originally give it a 9 otherwise.

1609
02:08:45,760 --> 02:08:52,760
Fair enough. Jonas, who just came in the house a little bit ago, explicit. There's a mic over there for you guys.

1610
02:08:52,760 --> 02:08:58,760
I know you got to hear a little bit of Ono Ken, so what'd you think of Ono Ken? Hold the bottom when you talk. That's all. Alright, what's up?

1611
02:08:58,760 --> 02:09:01,760
I'll give it my other pen. Well, I guess.

1612
02:09:01,760 --> 02:09:05,760
Alright. Well put. Angel, your thoughts?

1613
02:09:05,760 --> 02:09:12,760
I really liked it. Kinda Rave-y. Just my style. Definitely a 10 from me.

1614
02:09:13,760 --> 02:09:24,760
My thoughts is I really liked it. It could stand to have been a little shorter, but I'm just lazy, so I give it a 9, because it's not the song's fault that I'm lazy.

1615
02:09:24,760 --> 02:09:31,760
It was good. I've listened to it before, so I actually didn't even listen to the whole song at all.

1616
02:09:31,760 --> 02:09:34,760
Because I've had this song forever.

1617
02:09:34,760 --> 02:09:36,760
So on a scale of 1 to 10?

1618
02:09:36,760 --> 02:09:38,760
It gets a 9, because it's just...

1619
02:09:38,760 --> 02:09:40,760
I don't think it can do you no wrong.

1620
02:09:40,760 --> 02:09:44,760
Fair enough. And lastly but not, or I'm sorry, lastly but not leastly.

1621
02:09:44,760 --> 02:09:47,760
That's what I'm thinking. Lastly, I almost said lastly but not lastly.

1622
02:09:47,760 --> 02:09:49,760
Ah, Arcadia!

1623
02:09:49,760 --> 02:09:51,760
You said last but not loosely.

1624
02:09:51,760 --> 02:09:53,760
We never knew that you were loosely.

1625
02:09:53,760 --> 02:10:00,760
it was something out of DDR or 2DX or something. It had that background that was sort of...

1626
02:10:00,760 --> 02:10:06,760
It was a bit repetitive in the background, but still was pretty cool. Give it a 9.

1627
02:10:06,760 --> 02:10:11,760
Didn't you kind of get a little bit of a Taku vibe from it? Like, Still My Words-ish?

1628
02:10:11,760 --> 02:10:15,760
Yeah, there was another one that was...

1629
02:10:15,760 --> 02:10:17,760
Like, you know, one of the soft traces.

1630
02:10:17,760 --> 02:10:18,760
Like traces.

1631
02:10:18,760 --> 02:10:19,760
Yeah, like traces.

1632
02:10:19,760 --> 02:10:22,760
Yeah, it made me think of traces.

1633
02:10:22,760 --> 02:10:31,760
Okay, let's go on to Loki's pick, and I think he tried to come up with something at the last minute, but I don't think it worked. He's going back to an old favorite.

1634
02:10:31,760 --> 02:10:35,760
No, I wasn't trying to come up with anything at the last minute. I was just seeing if I wanted to do any new shit.

1635
02:10:35,760 --> 02:10:40,760
But, I have to check. And that also reminds me that Fucking Diverse Systems hasn't sent me my CD.

1636
02:10:40,760 --> 02:10:46,760
Now, I understand that there is a little problem with that they weren't offering it to the US, but I thought I'd try ordering it anyway.

1637
02:10:46,760 --> 02:10:52,220
and they have my money and I don't have a CD and that makes me mad as long as

1638
02:10:52,220 --> 02:10:59,020
they send me a CD but anyways so no I went ahead and decided that I'm gonna go

1639
02:10:59,020 --> 02:11:04,020
ahead and try the echo image card again because god damn it they will win I

1640
02:11:04,020 --> 02:11:09,780
promise you they will win so this is echo image with one of my favorite songs

1641
02:11:09,780 --> 02:11:11,780
Come back

1642
02:11:39,780 --> 02:11:54,780
Come back for you, it's always the same thing, it's always the same thing

1643
02:11:54,780 --> 02:11:58,780
I fall back to you

1644
02:11:58,780 --> 02:12:01,780
It's always the same thing

1645
02:12:01,780 --> 02:12:06,780
It's always the same as me, dear

1646
02:12:06,780 --> 02:12:36,460
Come back to me, let me get the real thing

1647
02:12:36,460 --> 02:12:39,460
Let me get the real thing

1648
02:12:40,460 --> 02:12:44,460
I want all that you need

1649
02:12:44,460 --> 02:12:46,460
I'm lying here waiting

1650
02:12:46,460 --> 02:12:51,460
I'm waiting, chasing, sleeping

1651
02:12:51,460 --> 02:12:57,460
In my heart, I'm searching out for you

1652
02:12:58,460 --> 02:13:01,460
You hear me calling

1653
02:13:01,460 --> 02:13:08,460
I know the way, I know the way, I know

1654
02:13:08,460 --> 02:13:15,460
To see me fall down, free of all my pain

1655
02:13:15,460 --> 02:13:22,460
Singing out to you, you hear me calling

1656
02:13:22,460 --> 02:13:29,460
I know the way, I know the way, I know

1657
02:14:29,460 --> 02:14:36,460
Know the way I feel, the way I know

1658
02:14:36,460 --> 02:14:40,460
To keep me coming

1659
02:14:40,460 --> 02:14:46,460
Be my heartbeat, together with you

1660
02:14:46,460 --> 02:14:50,460
You keep me coming

1661
02:14:50,460 --> 02:14:57,460
Know the way I feel, the way I know

1662
02:14:57,460 --> 02:15:02,460
You'll see me for me

1663
02:16:02,460 --> 02:16:27,460
Song number three in tonight's cage match, Echo Image with Come Back.

1664
02:16:27,460 --> 02:16:30,460
Jamie, come back and give us your vote.

1665
02:16:30,460 --> 02:16:33,460
Oh, did I miss something?

1666
02:16:33,460 --> 02:16:34,460
Yes, you did. Echo Image.

1667
02:16:34,460 --> 02:16:37,460
Oh, yeah. It was good. I really liked that song.

1668
02:16:37,460 --> 02:16:39,460
It was just so...

1669
02:16:40,460 --> 02:16:46,460
I mean, again, that would be another one that I would just listen to endlessly, but I don't think it was quite cage-matchy.

1670
02:16:46,460 --> 02:16:48,460
Still, I'm giving it an 8.

1671
02:16:49,460 --> 02:16:51,460
Alright, fair enough. Radley!

1672
02:16:55,460 --> 02:16:57,460
Gotta grab the thing.

1673
02:16:57,460 --> 02:17:05,460
For me, the background is pretty good, but the lyrics and the way it's sung is kind of blah.

1674
02:17:05,460 --> 02:17:08,460
So, eh, I can give it a six.

1675
02:17:08,460 --> 02:17:11,460
Alright. Angel.

1676
02:17:11,460 --> 02:17:18,460
Um, duh, Echo of Edge, ten. I know, I've been giving a lot of tens lately, huh?

1677
02:17:18,460 --> 02:17:19,460
You are, you're the ten whore.

1678
02:17:19,460 --> 02:17:21,460
I'm not a ten whore.

1679
02:17:21,460 --> 02:17:24,460
You're TDR Angel, USA, tenth mix. Alright.

1680
02:17:24,460 --> 02:17:26,460
Alright.

1681
02:17:26,460 --> 02:17:29,460
Ugh, a comment.

1682
02:17:29,460 --> 02:17:31,460
Exquisite.

1683
02:17:31,460 --> 02:17:33,460
8.5 out of 10.

1684
02:17:33,460 --> 02:17:35,460
Alright, 8.5 out of 10.

1685
02:17:35,460 --> 02:17:39,460
My thoughts, you know what, it's kind of, this is really hard for me.

1686
02:17:39,460 --> 02:17:42,460
Because that is like my favorite song at the moment right now.

1687
02:17:42,460 --> 02:17:44,460
I love that song.

1688
02:17:44,460 --> 02:17:47,460
And in most normal circumstances I would give that song an 11.

1689
02:17:47,460 --> 02:17:51,460
But the problem is that I kind of feel the way Jamie does

1690
02:17:51,460 --> 02:17:56,260
does where it's not quite the song I would see winning cage match it is kind

1691
02:17:56,260 --> 02:18:00,200
of slow and like I think if that played in the middle of the dance music station

1692
02:18:00,200 --> 02:18:05,440
it would be kind of weird so so I'm taking my 11 and bringing it down to like

1693
02:18:05,440 --> 02:18:11,860
a 9.9 all right but you know what it's not up to us it's up to you guys oh look

1694
02:18:11,860 --> 02:18:18,460
he's got a boat well duh I do don't I know I give it an 11 because I'm still

1695
02:18:18,460 --> 02:18:21,700
listening to this in my car over and over again I don't even know how long

1696
02:18:21,700 --> 02:18:26,980
I've had this CD for and I still listen to it constantly it's just in my player

1697
02:18:26,980 --> 02:18:33,780
I'm listening to tracks one or two nine and five those are the three tracks I

1698
02:18:33,780 --> 02:18:36,740
like and then I just let everything else play through because it's awesome still

1699
02:18:36,740 --> 02:18:40,500
I love four because it sounds like a razor but anyway it doesn't matter um

1700
02:18:40,500 --> 02:18:44,660
it's your I feel the exact same way honestly echo image

1701
02:18:44,660 --> 02:18:48,660
CompuPhonic, you must get the CD. It is so good.

1702
02:18:48,660 --> 02:18:52,660
That's all I listened to while I was back east. It was the only CD I had on me.

1703
02:18:52,660 --> 02:18:56,660
And I'm still not sick of it. I love it. But anyway.

1704
02:18:56,660 --> 02:19:00,660
Enough about what I think. Let's get to what you guys think and your chance to vote on

1705
02:19:00,660 --> 02:19:04,660
tonight's winner. Here are those three songs one more time, starting with

1706
02:19:04,660 --> 02:19:31,980
Song number 2 tonight was Ono Ken with Vijore.

1707
02:19:31,980 --> 02:19:51,240
Song number three tonight was Echo Image with Come Back.

1708
02:19:51,240 --> 02:19:54,080
Alright place your vote now.

1709
02:19:54,080 --> 02:19:59,400
Send a private message to Skye in the chat room with your vote and Loki just found something

1710
02:19:59,400 --> 02:20:04,820
on the internet that's very cool that we must find. They sung the Neverending Story, or

1711
02:20:04,820 --> 02:20:09,060
a version of it, Echo Image. Echo Image did a version of Neverending Story, it looks like.

1712
02:20:09,060 --> 02:20:12,300
Yes, I don't know if it's the same song, but it's got the same title, so I'm gonna look

1713
02:20:12,300 --> 02:20:16,700
for it. All right, we'll find out. Okay, so anyway, those are the three you get to vote

1714
02:20:16,700 --> 02:20:23,940
for right now, Lupin, Vigore, or Come Back. All right, I'm gonna open up the Skype line

1715
02:20:23,940 --> 02:20:30,420
one more time. Any of your thoughts you want to talk to us about DDR Extreme USA, certainly,

1716
02:20:30,420 --> 02:20:34,920
in the groove, we'll definitely want to hear your thoughts on that. Or, you know, anything

1717
02:20:34,920 --> 02:20:41,640
you want to bring up right now, fine by me. And we will get into, of course, the cage

1718
02:20:41,640 --> 02:20:46,560
match, not the cage match, the FUs of the week in a little bit. I want to give you guys

1719
02:20:46,560 --> 02:20:50,320
a chance for your votes to come in first though. Loki, in the meantime while we're waiting

1720
02:20:50,320 --> 02:21:14,320
Alfa24 came out last week, but I'll mention it again. Nothing really new, I think, came with that, except more bug fixes. And then, Technolize version 2.8 finally got released with new, supposedly another Easter egg thing in that, probably some cool stuff in the background. And they have their unlock, or the unlock mode stuff is in there. They finished all the stuff out of the game, and they've got some cool stuff in there, too.

1721
02:21:14,320 --> 02:21:20,440
their unlock or the unlock mode stuff is in there they finished all the stuff for

1722
02:21:20,440 --> 02:21:25,360
that and fix some of the alpha 24 problems and there's also a poll going

1723
02:21:25,360 --> 02:21:28,960
on DDR maniacs right now because the guy that did all the character ripping for

1724
02:21:28,960 --> 02:21:32,760
fifth mix is pretty much done with it now and now he wants to know what other

1725
02:21:32,760 --> 02:21:36,640
games you want you know to rip characters from and he will go ahead and

1726
02:21:36,640 --> 02:21:41,360
get on that so I went ahead and voted for I think party collection or

1727
02:21:41,360 --> 02:21:43,520
something they wanted to do ultra mix but I figured there's only two

1728
02:21:43,520 --> 02:21:47,680
characters in Ultramix, so that's kind of a waste. But, um, so they're doing that right

1729
02:21:47,680 --> 02:21:54,120
now, and, um, I think that's pretty much it. There's not really much going on right now

1730
02:21:54,120 --> 02:21:59,160
other than that. Um, sort of sim-related, they're gonna have, um, Aaron in Japan is

1731
02:21:59,160 --> 02:22:04,440
actually hacking the US, um, home console version of DDR Extreme, much like they did

1732
02:22:04,440 --> 02:22:09,020
with the other, um, versions for the Japanese home versions, to add those modifiers that

1733
02:22:09,020 --> 02:22:13,400
found only in mission mode into normal gameplay and I'm sure they'll be

1734
02:22:13,400 --> 02:22:16,560
successful at that because they were with the other one and that's how you

1735
02:22:16,560 --> 02:22:22,560
got that hacked DDR extreme that's out there with the wave and or the Furu Furu

1736
02:22:22,560 --> 02:22:27,520
mode and 0.5 speed and all that wonderful stuff and break that you can

1737
02:22:27,520 --> 02:22:32,840
find in the arcade mixes which that is a free download I might add on ddramerica.com

1738
02:22:32,840 --> 02:22:36,800
a BitTorrent site and you can actually if you have a really kind operator at

1739
02:22:36,800 --> 02:22:45,800
at your local arcade, you can give that to them and I'm sure they'll put it in there for you. Like ours. So. Um, that's pretty much all that's going on at the moment.

1740
02:22:48,800 --> 02:22:55,800
Alright. Fair enough. How long ago did you order that diverse system CD that you still haven't gotten?

1741
02:22:56,800 --> 02:23:01,800
A couple months ago. Interesting. Are you gonna write them? Contact the Better Business Bureau over it?

1742
02:23:01,800 --> 02:23:31,800
They're Japanese, I can't understand my English, so I'll try. I'll like ask them, you know, hey, because I do, I still have the email, so I could email them again, you know, with that email later on once, because I'm thinking that they're just not released into the U.S., so they're not going to send it to me, but later on, you know, when the time comes when they do release it to the U.S., I'll be like, hey, I paid for this a long time ago, send me my fucking CD, so that's pretty much what it's going to come down to, and they'll have to because I have, you know, my

1743
02:23:31,800 --> 02:23:35,120
and receipts still from that it shows that it was paid for

1744
02:23:35,120 --> 02:23:38,640
so there's no disputing that they can just say no

1745
02:23:38,640 --> 02:23:43,120
and then I don't know. When you're dealing with international business

1746
02:23:43,120 --> 02:23:46,720
they don't necessarily have to send it to you. The business laws

1747
02:23:46,720 --> 02:23:51,520
overseas are a lot different than they are here. Well I don't think it would be a problem.

1748
02:23:51,520 --> 02:23:53,160
And you can't necessarily report a foreign

1749
02:23:53,160 --> 02:23:57,640
business to the Better Business Bureau. Well I wasn't going to do that anyway.

1750
02:23:57,640 --> 02:24:03,640
There's nothing, if they don't ship it to you and you pay for it, there's not really much you're going to be able to do about it.

1751
02:24:03,640 --> 02:24:11,640
Yeah. Oh well. If not, I'm out that fifty bucks. Not that it really matters.

1752
02:24:11,640 --> 02:24:15,640
Well, I'd be pissed too, but there's not much I can do about it.

1753
02:24:15,640 --> 02:24:20,640
And normally, you know me, I'm all like, you know, fight it however you can, but...

1754
02:24:20,640 --> 02:24:25,640
After my business law class, I've seen just what exactly happens when you're dealing with...

1755
02:24:25,640 --> 02:24:28,140
Did you pay for it with credit card? Can't you stop charges?

1756
02:24:28,140 --> 02:24:32,140
You can stop payment on a credit card, like, up to, think, what, five months later?

1757
02:24:32,140 --> 02:24:33,640
And you can still stop payment on it.

1758
02:24:33,640 --> 02:24:35,140
Yeah, you should be able to stop payment on bank transfer, too.

1759
02:24:35,140 --> 02:24:37,140
All you have to do is call your, uh, credit card company.

1760
02:24:37,140 --> 02:24:39,140
Yep. Tell them you didn't get your product.

1761
02:24:39,140 --> 02:24:43,140
Alright, anyway, uh, let's talk about Cage Match and the winner of tonight's Cage Match.

1762
02:24:43,140 --> 02:24:45,140
Um...

1763
02:24:45,140 --> 02:24:50,640
Uh, two of the songs, uh, did alright, but it wasn't enough to, uh, beat the third song.

1764
02:24:50,640 --> 02:24:52,640
Tonight's Cage Match winner is...

1765
02:24:52,640 --> 02:24:58,640
Echo Women!

1766
02:24:58,640 --> 02:25:03,640
Songs number one and two tied, but it weren't enough to overtake song number three.

1767
02:25:03,640 --> 02:25:06,640
Song number three got about what one and two did combined.

1768
02:25:06,640 --> 02:25:14,640
The power of Shane's persuasion to the chatroom.

1769
02:25:14,640 --> 02:25:17,640
Damn him for being a DER celebrity all of a sudden.

1770
02:25:17,640 --> 02:25:20,640
You know, people wouldn't have given a shit what he said previously.

1771
02:25:20,640 --> 02:25:24,840
just teasing a shame all right uh let's do another break and we're in that now

1772
02:25:24,840 --> 02:25:31,360
his words have a laxative effect when it comes to opinions possibly all right

1773
02:25:31,360 --> 02:25:35,560
we're gonna go to a break no actually you know what in all in all seriousness

1774
02:25:35,560 --> 02:25:39,920
I'm glad that song one I just kind of you know I'm still kind of like I don't

1775
02:25:39,920 --> 02:25:43,120
know but but some people when they voted for it they actually said I want to see

1776
02:25:43,120 --> 02:25:49,760
a slow song on orange lounge I know I did but I'm just a dick all right well

1777
02:25:49,760 --> 02:25:53,060
they'd need to they need to wake up and get it on I don't think it would have

1778
02:25:53,060 --> 02:25:56,460
been enough we were several several votes behind Jamie so I don't think it

1779
02:25:56,460 --> 02:26:01,580
would have been enough when it's pretty clear one songs gonna win all right

1780
02:26:01,580 --> 02:26:05,260
anyway let's go to a break and in this break I'm gonna pick up kind of a lot of

1781
02:26:05,260 --> 02:26:08,600
those leftover songs we haven't gotten to yet from DDR extreme USA including

1782
02:26:08,600 --> 02:26:13,280
one of my favorites diving I like that song by four strings like a virgin and

1783
02:26:13,280 --> 02:26:17,980
YMCA we're also gonna gay it up a little bit in this break when we come back did

1784
02:26:17,980 --> 02:26:21,320
Dude, I saw them perform that.

1785
02:26:21,320 --> 02:26:22,320
That's hot.

1786
02:26:22,320 --> 02:26:23,320
That was awesome.

1787
02:26:23,320 --> 02:26:25,860
When we come back, the FUs of the week.

1788
02:26:25,860 --> 02:26:27,240
You know it, you love it.

1789
02:26:27,240 --> 02:26:28,240
And it's coming up.

1790
02:26:28,240 --> 02:26:35,240
We'll be back.

1791
02:26:35,240 --> 02:26:53,240
Tell me a secret, I'll tell you mine Tell me about desire, you hide in the sky

1792
02:26:53,240 --> 02:26:58,240
There is so much that we should have done

1793
02:27:00,240 --> 02:27:03,240
I was into Cuba

1794
02:27:04,240 --> 02:27:08,240
Now I'm gone

1795
02:27:13,240 --> 02:27:15,240
Driving

1796
02:27:15,240 --> 02:27:21,240
Knowing it was you I keep on trying

1797
02:27:22,240 --> 02:27:28,240
Diving into you

1798
02:27:31,240 --> 02:27:35,240
Diving into you

1799
02:28:05,240 --> 02:28:24,240
I made it through the wilderness, somehow I made it through

1800
02:28:24,240 --> 02:28:31,240
Didn't know how long I was until I found you

1829
02:31:24,600 --> 02:31:29,100
on Orange Lounge Radio, live on this lovely Sunday evening, September the 26th of 2004,

1830
02:31:29,100 --> 02:31:34,980
Episode 113, In Progress. What's up with that Village People song? Is it just me or did

1831
02:31:34,980 --> 02:31:39,620
it sound different? It doesn't sound like the same YMCA I remember. It sounded like

1832
02:31:39,620 --> 02:31:43,700
they re-recorded or something. You are not putting your nasty foot on the webcam. A little

1833
02:31:43,700 --> 02:31:47,780
weird. Loki is changing out the bandage on his foot right now and he wants to put it

1834
02:31:47,780 --> 02:31:52,900
on the webcam to scare you all with. Look at his Silent Hill, you know, toe. Loki, how

1835
02:31:52,900 --> 02:31:56,980
was it to play DDR with that foot that's what I want to know oh I see that

1836

the hell I feel like it usually I'll play a whole CD or marathon stuff and

1855
02:33:27,860 --> 02:33:32,000
like I was so completely impromptu last week I just decided to play just to kill

1856
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:38,960
again the Eddie Izzard routine um pre-show starts at 7 o'clock or

1862
02:34:13,040 --> 02:34:17,040
sense of taste for music.

It's a good time. Yeah, listen. Wednesday night, 7 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.

1864
02:34:21,840 --> 02:34:25,520
We'll be back this Wednesday after a little bit of a hiatus, but Rice Princess

1865
02:34:25,520 --> 02:34:28,240
Lanky Style and myself, we bring you a little show called

1866
02:34:28,240 --> 02:34:32,640
Outside the Box, which is a show dedicated to video gaming.

1867
02:34:32,640 --> 02:34:36,720
The other games, besides that DDR and foot stomping and

1868
02:34:36,720 --> 02:34:40,680
you know, beat hitting games. It's a show dedicated to all that other stuff, and of

1869
02:34:40,680 --> 02:34:42,720
course we're starting to get into the Christmas season.

1870
02:34:42,720 --> 02:34:47,080
Whole lot of news we got to catch up on from the past couple weeks, so definitely tune in this Wednesday

1871
02:34:47,080 --> 02:34:51,440
It's also the home of bot mania, and if you don't know what that is you should tune in and find out

1872
02:34:52,440 --> 02:34:58,280
Anyway now we're gonna get into another totally random part of our program, but you know what it's tradition

1873
02:34:58,280 --> 02:35:00,960
We've done it a hundred and thirteen weeks in a row now

1874
02:35:00,960 --> 02:35:06,640
And we'll be damned if we're ever gonna stop this segment. It is the F use of the week Jamie

1875
02:35:07,200 --> 02:35:11,220
Why is it for 113 weeks in a row now? We have to do the F use of the week

1876
02:35:11,220 --> 02:35:16,220
Because I'm still full of angst and I can't make it stop.

1877
02:35:31,220 --> 02:35:35,220
I would like to give a big F you to the majority of the human race.

1878
02:35:36,220 --> 02:35:38,220
For one very big reason.

1879
02:35:38,220 --> 02:35:44,180
There's a stupid moron who ran out in front of my car on Madison Avenue while I'm going 60

1880
02:35:46,100 --> 02:35:50,000
But I would I would have hit him had he continued

1881
02:35:50,420 --> 02:35:57,640
Asshole decides that he's oh, there's a torso heading to meet her and so he jumped out back into lane, and I'm just like

1882
02:35:58,380 --> 02:36:03,060
Looking I managed to slow down enough. I was going about 20 where I got where he would have been

1883
02:36:03,060 --> 02:36:05,600
I'm just looking at this guy like oh my god

1884
02:36:05,600 --> 02:36:08,900
what planet are you from are you from the planet of like perpetually flat

1885
02:36:08,900 --> 02:36:13,940
people you know cuz they all get run over by cars you stupid fucker and then

1886
02:36:13,940 --> 02:36:18,840
there's like the guy on the motorcycle who like decides that he's gonna speed

1887
02:36:18,840 --> 02:36:22,360
up when I'm trying to change lanes I'm halfway into the goddamn lane and then

1888
02:36:22,360 --> 02:36:30,000
he blows oh what I yeah I was going 60 on Madison I usually go 60 on Madison it

1889
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:32,840
It was in the 50's though, it was only 10 miles over.

1890
02:36:32,840 --> 02:36:36,560
Don't get in the- Don't- Oh my god, me!

1891
02:36:36,560 --> 02:36:38,560
Okay, anyway.

1892
02:36:38,560 --> 02:36:47,080
So, uh, I was, uh, there's also, like, this old lady who was in front of the line, um,

1893
02:36:47,080 --> 02:36:55,240
at, uh, um, the grocery store, who decided that she was gonna be the slowest person ever.

1894
02:36:55,240 --> 02:36:57,240
This is in the express lane.

1895
02:36:57,240 --> 02:37:00,880
They finally get it all in and then they change cashiers and start counting out the door

1896
02:37:00,880 --> 02:37:06,900
I'm like what and then like a big ashy goes to all that Chinese food and all like the carby food

1897
02:37:06,900 --> 02:37:14,700
I've been eating all weekend because I decided that I was gonna gonna cheat like mad all weekend and I have and now my

1898
02:37:14,700 --> 02:37:16,340
stomach hurts

1899
02:37:16,340 --> 02:37:19,480
But I had coconut cream pie this weekend and that makes it all right

1900
02:37:19,480 --> 02:37:23,960
And I want to go have a beer I had coconut cream pie when I was on the East Coast

1901
02:37:23,960 --> 02:37:27,380
coast was very good. There's that little truck stop style diner too.

1902
02:37:27,380 --> 02:37:30,440
The Hofbrau. Hofbrau!

1903
02:37:30,440 --> 02:37:33,240
You can't call it the Hofbrau. The Hofbrau! Hofbrau!

1904
02:37:33,240 --> 02:37:37,480
Especially in a town where Arnold Schwarzenegger is governor. Come on.

1905
02:37:37,480 --> 02:37:41,640
It's the Hofbrau!

1906
02:37:41,640 --> 02:37:44,880
And F you to the situation where people say

1907
02:37:44,880 --> 02:37:49,280
oh sure we'll call you when we're ready to eat and then they go out to eat already.

1908
02:37:49,280 --> 02:37:53,760
And then an F you

1909
02:37:53,760 --> 02:38:00,580
goes toward a friend's parent for saying something for completely making an

1910
02:38:00,580 --> 02:38:04,460
assumption about something that my fiancee had said and for just going off

1911
02:38:04,460 --> 02:38:09,740
on them with no reason okay first of all when you assume it makes an ass out of

1912
02:38:09,740 --> 02:38:17,060
you and me okay you learn this when you're in middle school okay and then

1913
02:38:17,060 --> 02:38:21,100
another F you go saw the people who drive like huge luxury sedans and SUVs

1914
02:38:21,100 --> 02:38:27,420
who park in compact places your car is not little and also learn how to fucking

1915
02:38:27,420 --> 02:38:31,100
stay in the in the lines okay if you're gonna park your car there there's

1916
02:38:31,100 --> 02:38:34,740
nowhere else to do it at least keep your car between the lines so that other

1917
02:38:34,740 --> 02:38:39,980
people can park I used to go around to people who do that at school and pour

1918
02:38:39,980 --> 02:38:45,180
honey on their driver's side door on the handle in the middle of summer you're so

1919
02:38:45,180 --> 02:38:48,820
mature and I would go back and check the handle when I was leaving and there

1920
02:38:48,820 --> 02:38:54,180
would be flies on it and it would be awesome this was you know when I was

1921
02:38:54,180 --> 02:38:59,680
first in school but it's like these are the people that I leave notes on their

1922
02:38:59,680 --> 02:39:05,820
car now you know the other day I left a diagram on how to properly park the car

1923
02:39:05,820 --> 02:39:12,000
on the top of this SUV also another F you goes toward the h2 for looking

1924
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:15,180
stupid okay what was wrong with the Hummer

1925
02:39:15,180 --> 02:39:17,180
Rob, what was wrong with the Hummer? Do you know?

1926
02:39:17,180 --> 02:39:19,180
Uh, everything. I'm just kidding.

1927
02:39:19,180 --> 02:39:21,180
No. They looked, they looked cool.

1928
02:39:21,180 --> 02:39:23,180
They were tough.

1929
02:39:23,180 --> 02:39:27,180
And now they're all like, hi, we're gonna look, uh, completely suburban.

1930
02:39:27,180 --> 02:39:29,180
Aren't those those square cars, the Hummers?

1931
02:39:29,180 --> 02:39:30,180
Yeah, they were awesome though.

1932
02:39:30,180 --> 02:39:31,180
They're square!

1933
02:39:31,180 --> 02:39:33,180
They're cool!

1934
02:39:33,180 --> 02:39:35,180
Alright. Whatever.

1935
02:39:35,180 --> 02:39:39,180
And I want to put a rocket launcher on one and drive it to work.

1936
02:39:39,180 --> 02:39:42,180
And, it's just...

1937
02:39:42,180 --> 02:39:46,180
Okay, I've got the inked out. That's really my major B.

1938
02:39:46,180 --> 02:39:48,180
Alright. You sure?

1939
02:39:48,180 --> 02:39:49,180
I should've run over that guy.

1940
02:39:49,180 --> 02:39:51,180
Alright. Yeah, I think you should've too. Teach him a lesson.

1941
02:39:51,180 --> 02:39:52,180
Darwinizing.

1942
02:39:52,180 --> 02:39:55,180
Well, let's move on to, uh, Loki.

1943
02:39:57,180 --> 02:40:00,180
I'd like to say that I can't be that bad. What the hell?

1944
02:40:00,180 --> 02:40:03,180
Uh, my first F.U. goes to Rob's chair. Um, okay, there we go.

1945
02:40:03,180 --> 02:40:11,180
Okay, that was easy. Um, uh, actually, I'm not that mad right now because I just noticed I'm getting a whole lot of new echo images and that makes me happy.

1946
02:40:11,180 --> 02:40:14,180
Uh, but my main F.U. goes to my toe, because it hurts bad.

1947
02:40:14,180 --> 02:40:19,180
I mean, it doesn't, it just, it hurts more with the, like, where they poke the needle in.

1948
02:40:19,180 --> 02:40:22,180
Because it's actually bruised, and if you touch it, it's really tender, and it's like, ugh.

1949
02:40:22,180 --> 02:40:28,180
Now, my toe looks really nasty, and it burns every now and then, so that's kind of bad.

1950
02:40:28,180 --> 02:40:32,180
But, you know, I should just have gone to the doctor earlier, and we wouldn't have this problem.

1951
02:40:32,180 --> 02:40:35,180
So that's, you know, a rule for everybody.

1952
02:40:35,180 --> 02:40:41,180
If you have a problem, don't wait it out, because you don't know, the doctor knows better than you do.

1953
02:40:41,180 --> 02:40:45,180
So just go to the doctor, take care of, and that's it.

1954
02:40:45,180 --> 02:40:52,180
And, um, other F.U. goes to Paranoia Eternal on Handsome Feet mode for breaking my lamp.

1955
02:40:52,180 --> 02:40:58,180
That wasn't my fault, that was purely DDR Extreme's fault for breaking the lamp.

1956
02:40:58,180 --> 02:41:17,180
And finally, um, I don't know, that's pretty much all I've got. Oh, um, oh yeah, fuck you to goddamn Jack in the Box for being fucking slow, because they burned the stupid chicken tenders. Stupid.

1957
02:41:17,180 --> 02:41:21,180
But that's all. I'm done.

1958
02:41:28,180 --> 02:41:34,180
F.U. to myself for not taking Monday off of work because after leaving on a two week trip I really should have taken the next couple days off.

1959
02:41:34,180 --> 02:41:37,180
So I could just relax and catch up with everything I missed.

1960
02:41:37,180 --> 02:41:42,180
But F.U. to being gone so long because I missed everybody and it was sad but I'm back now and everything's better.

1961
02:41:42,180 --> 02:41:44,180
We missed you too but our aim's improving.

1962
02:41:44,180 --> 02:41:45,180
I know, you're trying.

1963
02:41:45,180 --> 02:41:52,060
trying. FU to the mall where the DDR pad was broken, that kind of pissed me off. FU to

1964
02:41:52,060 --> 02:41:55,740
the same jack in the box because that was my chicken tenders they burned and had to

1965
02:41:55,740 --> 02:42:02,060
go back and do and they could have given us an update or something, but whatever. FU to

1966
02:42:02,060 --> 02:42:06,640
all these video games coming out all at once that I want to buy and not having enough money

1967
02:42:06,640 --> 02:42:12,780
to buy them all, but you know, I'll live. And I guess that's really it. I don't have

1968
02:42:12,780 --> 02:42:19,420
a whole lot of angst. I never do. I'm a nice person. Okay, maybe not, but I'm not feeling

1969
02:42:19,420 --> 02:42:24,220
very creative tonight, so deal with it. Oh, I thought I won. F you to the fact that my

1970
02:42:24,220 --> 02:42:30,820
flight got delayed leaving from Phoenix into California, into Sacramento, because we all

1971
02:42:30,820 --> 02:42:34,300
get on the plane and we're all sitting there and it's a full flight and it's just all packed

1972
02:42:34,300 --> 02:42:38,980
and I don't like all those people being so close to all those people to begin with, especially

1973
02:42:38,980 --> 02:42:42,780
when you're sitting next to somebody whose arm is all up in the armrest, and it feels

1974
02:42:42,780 --> 02:42:46,940
like they're invading your personal space and stuff. And, ugh, anyway, I don't like

1975
02:42:46,940 --> 02:42:53,420
that. And then being told that, oh, we're missing a part, we have to go change a part

1976
02:42:53,420 --> 02:42:57,420
on the plane, and then we're stuck there for like 20 minutes while they change a part.

1977
02:42:57,420 --> 02:43:03,600
Oh well, what can you do? Alright, let's get to some other FUs in studio. Let's start off

1978
02:43:03,600 --> 02:43:09,280
who's got a microphone somebody's got to have on oh god here he comes Jonas with

1979
02:43:09,280 --> 02:43:16,320
his F you sweetie two items or less I'll keep it as fast as fast as possible okay

1980
02:43:16,320 --> 02:43:21,320
I only give an F you to work we're not giving me we're not giving me some free

1981
02:43:21,320 --> 02:43:24,840
time I need to spend some time with my family I can't even keep getting like

1982
02:43:24,840 --> 02:43:30,880
five hours oh I mean five week five days a week first of all of school as well

1983
02:43:30,880 --> 02:43:32,880
All of us work and go to school.

1984
02:43:32,880 --> 02:43:38,880
I know that, but I have to take care of family as well. I gotta move, because I'm moving somewhere. I'm moving to another house.

1985
02:43:38,880 --> 02:43:56,400
F you to, F you to some asshole after borrowing a car for, without my permission to actually

1986

change the fluids of the inside light.

1987
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:06,120
You don't put fucking engine oil on to where the coolant is supposed to be at.

1988
02:44:06,120 --> 02:44:07,520
That ain't fucking cool.

1989
02:44:07,520 --> 02:44:13,600
My car fucked up there.

1990
02:44:13,600 --> 02:44:18,840
And FU for not being able to play DDR Extreme for the PS2, I'm hearing some pretty good

1991
02:44:18,840 --> 02:44:20,720
reviews towards it.

1992
02:44:20,720 --> 02:44:27,040
FU for Maximizer's desk being sucky as hell.

1993
02:44:27,040 --> 02:44:32,040
FU to RVGL for not fixing their goddamn pads, I wanted to try the AX2, I wasted a dollar

1994
02:44:32,040 --> 02:44:33,040
for nothing.

1995
02:44:33,040 --> 02:44:35,320
And not to mention some extra gas money

1996
02:44:37,920 --> 02:44:39,920
F you to

1997
02:44:40,120 --> 02:44:42,120

People people people don't know what to do

2000
02:44:48,600 --> 02:44:52,200
When to quit so you think because throw a bunch of tax on the road

2001
02:44:53,040 --> 02:44:55,040
hahaha

2002
02:44:55,680 --> 02:45:00,480
And F you for dope people don't know parking and for double parking in the

2003
02:45:00,480 --> 02:45:08,800
the school area. We all have to park as well, not just one car hogging two lanes. And thanks

2004
02:45:08,800 --> 02:45:14,000
to that, I actually failed the damn midterm because of that. That was 30 minutes late

2005
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:20,800
in class. And I just have to keep the FUs short. Might as well give it to someone else.

2006
02:45:20,800 --> 02:45:24,360
All right. Bradley. Bradley, you're FUs.

2007
02:45:24,360 --> 02:45:29,080

02:45:39,080 --> 02:45:44,520

2010
02:45:44,520 --> 02:45:49,120
so fucking annoying you can come up to a space and say oh i can go park here oh no the dumb

2011
02:45:49,120 --> 02:45:53,120
Shit, put the fucking cards in the middle of the space.

2012
02:45:53,120 --> 02:45:58,120
Put it up in one of the meatiest little things, and it's not in the way, that's okay.

2013
02:45:58,120 --> 02:46:04,120
It's still annoying, you're a lazy ass for not taking it to the receptacle or back to the store.

2014
02:46:04,120 --> 02:46:07,120
But if it's in the way, it's a bitch.

2015
02:46:07,120 --> 02:46:11,120
Okay, let's see, what else?

2016
02:46:11,120 --> 02:46:16,120
Fuck you to being lazy after work and not really getting much done.

2017
02:46:16,120 --> 02:46:24,120
And, I think, and I'll give a fuck you to dial up for being slow, and that'd be part of the reason.

2018
02:46:24,120 --> 02:46:28,120
It takes forever to go read the live journal and check up on everything.

2019
02:46:28,120 --> 02:46:31,120
And, that's about it.

2020
02:46:31,120 --> 02:46:34,120
DDR Angel, your FUs of the Week.

2021
02:46:34,120 --> 02:46:39,120
Um, I'm feeling gummy worms from being addicting, dammit.

2022
02:46:39,120 --> 02:46:42,120
Because we can't stop eating them anyway.

2023
02:46:42,120 --> 02:46:44,900
Don't really have that many. I'm used to this week. I

2024
02:46:46,300 --> 02:46:49,540
Was getting all excited about Final Fantasy 11 until Andrew just

2025
02:46:50,220 --> 02:46:56,660
Text message me and said my video card might not like it. So after you do that, but maybe we'll get that fixed

2026
02:46:58,140 --> 02:47:00,140
Yeah

2027
02:47:00,380 --> 02:47:03,140
Yeah, maybe maybe maybe the benchmark I don't know

2028
02:47:04,820 --> 02:47:07,140
No, yeah the benchmark oh, yeah, we have that my

2029
02:47:07,140 --> 02:47:13,140
I hope to get that fixed tomorrow so I can play with the rest of the group.

2030
02:47:13,140 --> 02:47:16,140
I guess that's it. There's not really that much to-

2031
02:47:16,140 --> 02:47:26,140
Oh yeah, and I feed him my computer science teacher for getting our webpage project that was due like Friday.

2032
02:47:26,140 --> 02:47:29,140
He's like, oh, okay, I'll just bring it on Monday so you guys can do your presentation.

2033
02:47:29,140 --> 02:47:32,140
It's like, Dork, you're the one that said you were going to bring it in on Wednesday.

2034
02:47:32,140 --> 02:47:36,140
Well, whatever. Yeah, that's it.

2035
02:47:36,140 --> 02:47:40,040

2038
02:47:50,360 --> 02:47:52,220
It was fun

2039

If you to J tap for being one of the most boring anime conventions I've ever attended

2040
02:47:56,500 --> 02:47:58,600
My only complaint is I didn't get to hang around with friends

2041
02:47:58,600 --> 02:48:03,520
I haven't seen for a long time even though I was staffing in the video department. I wish I could have gone

2042
02:48:03,520 --> 02:48:08,600
something came up I couldn't go I was originally planning

2043

02:48:29,800 --> 02:48:36,800

2049
02:48:37,800 --> 02:48:41,880

2050
02:48:41,880 --> 02:48:44,320
groove. Hey, I said good things about it.

2051
02:48:44,320 --> 02:48:46,480
I said bad things about it too.

2052
02:48:46,480 --> 02:48:50,760
John Field said F you to spilling soda all over myself at dinner. F you to not enough

2053

Sid says, F you to Utah for being a Bimani wasteland, F you to my hands for failing get-on-beat-wild style every time that I play it, F you to the samurai of the world for the suppression of the ninja clans.

2056
02:49:08,800 --> 02:49:10,800
Are they still around? I don't know.

2057
02:49:10,800 --> 02:49:15,800
And F you to my body for waking me up at 5am every day when I really need to get up at 7.

2058
02:49:15,800 --> 02:49:22,800
Siegert says, F you to the whiny-ass DDR freak people who complain that Extreme US is crappy because it doesn't cater there once. Get over it!

2059
02:49:22,800 --> 02:49:26,800
FU to those same people who blame Konami of America for EXUS's faults.

2060
02:49:26,800 --> 02:49:28,800
Try blaming the right company for once.

2061
02:49:28,800 --> 02:49:29,800
Oh!

2062
02:49:29,800 --> 02:49:32,800

And finally, FU to the DS only coming out in the silver-black color.

2064
02:49:35,800 --> 02:49:37,800
I want some sort of blue.

2065
02:49:37,800 --> 02:49:39,800
Just wait. Pokémon Blue.

2066
02:49:40,800 --> 02:49:46,800
Zaku says FU to having to spend the better part of Friday cleaning out the shit called Spyware Attaware for my computer.

2067
02:49:46,800 --> 02:49:57,800
FU to Fox News Live for basically making DDR Freak Mod Frequency look like a fool when she asked them that she thought she was going to interview a nine-year-old and making DDR look like a fad instead of a serious weight loss tool.

2068
02:49:57,800 --> 02:50:00,800
We're actually going to get to that. We have like five minutes left in show, but I want to get to that.

2069
02:50:00,800 --> 02:50:11,800
Rychan says, FU to all the American brats acting like festival was made for them so they have every right to bitch about the preliminary song list. Another thing we didn't even get to.

2070
02:50:11,800 --> 02:50:15,020
F you to arcade manager for not doing anything to take care of our machine.

2071
02:50:15,020 --> 02:50:19,520
F you to Konami style for not making it easier to get ahold of the 2DX8 style limited edition.

2072
02:50:21,280 --> 02:50:22,360
Uhh...

2073
02:50:23,360 --> 02:50:24,360
DD Archaholic.

2074
02:50:24,700 --> 02:50:25,360
Uhh...

2075
02:50:25,660 --> 02:50:27,560
F you to my emerging pot belly.

2076
02:50:27,800 --> 02:50:30,920
F you to my old CD burner for deciding it doesn't want to burn discs anymore.

2077
02:50:30,920 --> 02:50:33,580
So I replaced your stupid head with the new DVD burner. Yay.

2078
02:50:33,880 --> 02:50:35,640
Rob, your new icon has a penis in it.

2079
02:50:35,640 --> 02:50:39,000
No it doesn't! I did not put a penis in the icon. You guys are just seeing things.

2080
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:43,460
Oh, and F you to this insane beeping sound that keeps going off somewhere in my apartment

2081
02:50:43,460 --> 02:50:46,420
complex every five minutes and has been doing so for several days now.

2082
02:50:46,420 --> 02:50:49,660
Maybe longer because I only just recently noticed it and now it's fucking annoying because

2083
02:50:49,660 --> 02:50:52,780
it goes beep, beep, beep every five freaking minutes every day.

2084
02:50:52,780 --> 02:50:58,460
Lastly, Ninz says F you to myself for picking a hard to find topic for my research paper.

2085
02:50:58,460 --> 02:50:59,460
F you to my boss.

2086
02:50:59,460 --> 02:51:02,940
She has this wonderful idea if someone only works for two or three days a week, no matter

2087
02:51:02,940 --> 02:51:06,220
how many hours they work in those days, she doesn't pay you that week and rolls it into

2088
02:51:06,220 --> 02:51:07,220
next week.

2089
02:51:07,220 --> 02:51:08,900
I'm going to school now and can't work that much.

2090
02:51:08,900 --> 02:51:10,900
I need my damn money now!

2091
02:51:10,900 --> 02:51:14,900
An F.U. to the creepy guy that was following my friends and I at the movie theater last night.

2092
02:51:14,900 --> 02:51:18,900
Later came out from a friend working there that he had been there for hours talking to random people.

2093
02:51:18,900 --> 02:51:22,900
And he says he should have that Echo Image Never Ending Story remix in five minutes.

2094
02:51:22,900 --> 02:51:24,900
So, pass that along to us. We want it too.

2095
02:51:28,900 --> 02:51:30,900
Alright. We're done.

2096
02:51:30,900 --> 02:51:32,900
Ah, with the F.U.s.

2097
02:51:32,900 --> 02:51:36,900
Ah, one more kind of big story this week we've got to get to.

2098
02:51:36,900 --> 02:51:45,980
So, DDR made an appearance on Fair and Balanced, hahaha, Fox News this week, and we actually

2099
02:51:45,980 --> 02:51:52,980
got a picture, not a picture, I'm sorry, the clip of the interview here, I actually haven't

2100
02:51:52,980 --> 02:51:55,940
even watched this, well I watched it when it was live on air, but I haven't even seen

2101
02:51:55,940 --> 02:52:00,380
this other little clip of it yet, it says it's 25 minutes, that can't be right, there

2102
02:52:00,380 --> 02:52:02,580
we go, that's more like it, it's only about 3 minutes.

2103
02:52:02,580 --> 02:52:06,340
Alright, let's check this out, here is a little interview, and we're going to do, of course,

2104
02:52:06,340 --> 02:52:10,060
typical Orange Lounge fashion we will butt in and make comments whenever we

2105
02:52:10,060 --> 02:52:14,140
feel like it on the Fox News clip so here it is the audio version for those

2106
02:52:14,140 --> 02:52:21,540
of you guys who didn't get a chance to hear it wow and the audio level is very

2107
02:52:21,540 --> 02:52:23,900
shitty let me see what I can do about that let me see if I can open it up in

2108
02:52:23,900 --> 02:52:27,220
another program give me a minute you guys sorry about that this is what

2109
02:52:27,220 --> 02:52:30,700
happens when you try to play something when you haven't really explored the

2110
02:52:30,700 --> 02:52:34,060
file yet if worse comes to worse we know I save it for next week let's see what I

2111
02:52:34,060 --> 02:52:44,140
can do about turning up the volume here. Let's go into this. Let's try it this way. You can't

2112
02:52:44,140 --> 02:52:54,780
hear it. The audio sucks. Ah. The audio sucks. It's in MPEG. Okay, Loki's going to try blasting

2113
02:52:54,780 --> 02:52:59,700
it for you guys. It's on my desktop. You should be able to share it, right? Hold on, hold

2114
02:52:59,700 --> 02:53:06,700
one

2115
02:53:09,620 --> 02:53:11,900
or can i copy it over to your network

2116
02:53:11,900 --> 02:53:15,680
we're having technical difficulties everybody

2117
02:53:15,680 --> 02:53:18,840
are really well i'm a try putting it on location here which are one of the thing

2118
02:53:18,840 --> 02:53:20,160
here

2119
02:53:20,160 --> 02:53:23,240
this is i get for trying to do things on the fly are a minute drop it in right

2120
02:53:23,240 --> 02:53:24,680
there

2121
02:53:24,680 --> 02:53:27,680
let's see that

2122
02:53:27,680 --> 02:53:33,680
Alright, here we go. Loki's got it. We're going to try to pump up the volume. What?

2123
02:53:33,680 --> 02:53:39,680
Dance Revolution or DDR. Let's kids get their groove on and lose weight at the same time.

2124
02:53:39,680 --> 02:53:47,680
With us now, DDR product manager Jason Enos and Don D'Amato, member of a fan club called DDR Freaks.

2125
02:53:47,680 --> 02:53:53,680
Pause it. Pause it. Pause it. Obviously they did their research there.

2126
02:53:53,680 --> 02:53:58,160
the member of the DDR Freaks. Did you know that you're a moderator on DDR

2127
02:53:58,160 --> 02:53:58,800
Freaks?

2128
02:53:58,800 --> 02:54:02,320
That woman is a moron.

2129
02:54:02,320 --> 02:54:05,800
Alright, start it up again.

2130
02:54:05,800 --> 02:54:09,680
Jason, first why don't you explain to me what DDR is?

2131
02:54:09,680 --> 02:54:14,240
Well, Dance Dance Revolution is an interactive video game that combines

2132
02:54:14,240 --> 02:54:17,840
physical activity with energetic dance music.

2133
02:54:17,840 --> 02:54:20,880
It allows you to actually drop your

2134
02:54:20,880 --> 02:54:26,740
controllers and get up on a dance floor and actually move to the groove this is

2135
02:54:26,740 --> 02:54:31,100
not that much different than twister without the music now yeah a lot of

2136
02:54:31,100 --> 02:54:33,960
people have said it's like karaoke for your feet

2137
02:54:33,960 --> 02:54:38,220
how's it posit posit I don't know that anyone that's ever called a karaoke for

2138
02:54:38,220 --> 02:54:41,780
your feet has anyone ever heard karaoke for your feet I've heard the twister

2139
02:54:41,780 --> 02:54:46,140
thing I've heard Simon says I've heard spider stomp I don't know maybe I should

2140
02:54:46,140 --> 02:54:52,340
to ask Jason Enos. Hey, you know what, my preschool teacher, her name was Mrs. Enos,

2141
02:54:52,340 --> 02:54:54,820
so you know what, respect a little bit here. Pause.

2142
02:54:54,820 --> 02:55:01,580
You are part of the DDR freaks, and I just have to out you on your age. You're 21 years

2143
02:55:01,580 --> 02:55:06,360
old, you're not a six-year-old, seven-year-old. Pause it. Pause it. That was like the most

2144
02:55:06,360 --> 02:55:10,340
belittling comment there. I have to out you on your age. You're not six or seven. Because

2145
02:55:10,340 --> 02:55:14,620
I can't tell by the fact that this guy has facial hair, he's got a little goatee going

2146
02:55:14,620 --> 02:55:20,220
on him. He looks like he's a pretty well-built guy. He does look like, by looks alone here,

2147
02:55:20,220 --> 02:55:25,940
he does appear to be past puberty. So you don't have to remind us of the fact that he's

2148
02:55:25,940 --> 02:55:33,660
not six or seven. It is quite obvious he's past his teenage years here. God, lady. What?

2149
02:55:33,660 --> 02:55:37,700
I love these Fox facts that read along the bottom of the screen too. I'm going to read

2150
02:55:37,700 --> 02:55:39,700
these for you guys so those that didn't see it. Yeah, Jamie?

2151
02:55:39,700 --> 02:55:42,820
Remember, the average person is an idiot.

2152
02:55:42,820 --> 02:55:45,460
They have to explain these things.

2153
02:55:45,460 --> 02:55:49,220
And plus, I'm five years older than this guy.

2154
02:55:49,220 --> 02:55:50,380
Jamie's older than this guy.

2155
02:55:50,380 --> 02:55:51,380
Matt's older than this guy.

2156
02:55:51,380 --> 02:55:52,500
Bradley's older than this guy.

2157
02:55:52,500 --> 02:55:55,020
I think almost everybody in this room except maybe,

2158
02:55:55,020 --> 02:55:57,020
how old are you, Jonas?

2159
02:55:57,020 --> 02:56:00,100
Then everybody in this room except Jonas is older than this guy.

2160
02:56:00,100 --> 02:56:02,780
So when she kind of says that to him, I kind of get mad.

2161
02:56:02,780 --> 02:56:04,820
But of course, this is Fox News, and they're stupid anyway.

2162
02:56:04,820 --> 02:56:06,980
Anyway, I'm positive.

2163
02:56:06,980 --> 02:56:08,140
21, yeah.

2164
02:56:08,140 --> 02:56:09,420
You like this?

2165
02:56:09,420 --> 02:56:22,740
Yeah, you know what, I know people who are 14 years old and I know people who are 40

2166
02:56:22,740 --> 02:56:27,020
years old, they're all playing the game, they all love the game, for whatever reason, either

2167
02:56:27,020 --> 02:56:29,020
it's exercise or even competition.

2168
02:56:29,020 --> 02:56:33,900
Yeah, so since this story has kind of a serious angle, we're talking about obesity in kids,

2169
02:56:33,900 --> 02:56:37,580
tell me about the losing weight part, does it really make you work up the sweat?

2170
02:56:37,580 --> 02:56:38,580
Pause it.

2171
02:56:38,580 --> 02:56:45,020
I want to point out at this moment they're showing people dancing on the

2172
02:56:45,020 --> 02:56:51,180
game wearing these kind of like aerobic looking things so let me get this

2173
02:56:51,180 --> 02:56:58,300
straight let me get this straight Don when I move I'm gonna work up a sweat is

2174
02:56:58,300 --> 02:57:03,900
that what you're telling me? Unpause it.

2175
02:57:03,900 --> 02:57:13,900
It makes me work a sweat. It's really, you know, songs can run you, you know, at a very slow pace or could even run you at a very high pace.

2176
02:57:13,900 --> 02:57:20,900
Songs can run up to 300 BPM and, you know, a regular song on the radio can only go to about maybe 120.

2177
02:57:20,900 --> 02:57:26,900
Positive. Okay, obviously they did not prep him with the questions there. I mean, you know, no offense to that guy.

2178
02:57:26,900 --> 02:57:31,900
But songs on the radio only go up to 130 BPM? I don't know so much about that.

2179
02:57:31,900 --> 02:57:36,020
about that but anyway I it is obvious that they did not let him know what the

2180
02:57:36,020 --> 02:57:39,940
questions would be in advance so you know he's probably because if it were to

2181
02:57:39,940 --> 02:57:47,180
go over that you know just your chaos would be bro ah too fast too fast can't

2182
02:57:47,180 --> 02:57:52,900
drive too fast just like nuclear bombs that go off the you know it's just the

2183
02:57:52,900 --> 02:57:59,620
world erupt into pure anarchy yeah all right I'm positive these songs can end

2184
02:57:59,620 --> 02:58:04,100
up being about three times as fast and moving around three times as fast as any, you know,

2185
02:58:04,100 --> 02:58:05,100
normal buddy movies.

2186
02:58:05,100 --> 02:58:08,580
And is this something like, I know like EverQuest and other games like that people do for hours

2187
02:58:08,580 --> 02:58:10,140
and hours, is this something that kids can...

2188
02:58:10,140 --> 02:58:11,140
You can.

2189
02:58:11,140 --> 02:58:13,500
You can find yourself saying just one more...

2190
02:58:13,500 --> 02:58:18,400
I just like, I would like to point out, lady, you can do anything for hours and hours.

2191
02:58:18,400 --> 02:58:23,500
You could play DDR, you could play EverQuest, you could masturbate for hours and hours if

2192
02:58:23,500 --> 02:58:24,500
you wanted to.

2193
02:58:24,500 --> 02:58:30,660
could, um, plot to murder Fox News reporters for hours and hours. I'm kidding. Um, pause

2194
02:58:30,660 --> 02:58:31,660
it.

2195
02:58:31,660 --> 02:58:34,100
Song. Just one more song. I'll be right, you know, I'll be right there. I'll be right,

2196
02:58:34,100 --> 02:58:38,460
you know, and, uh, it's just, it gets your entire body into it. You don't even pay attention

2197
02:58:38,460 --> 02:58:39,460
to yourself.

2198
02:58:39,460 --> 02:58:43,140
Pause it. Pause it. Yeah, also, they had to show your token Asian playing DDR there. But

2199
02:58:43,140 --> 02:58:46,700
I want to point out, I love how she had to compare it to EverQuest.

2200
02:58:46,700 --> 02:58:48,700
Excuse me?

2201
02:58:48,700 --> 02:58:55,700
So, does this game get you addicted and then you want to murder people like EverQuest does?

2202
02:58:55,700 --> 02:58:57,700
Do you think that your friends are orcs?

2203
02:58:57,700 --> 02:59:00,700
I want to put my score on eBay and sell it.

2204
02:59:00,700 --> 02:59:10,700
Okay, now wait a minute. That's not such a stretch because we all know that there are certain individuals that put their shoes on eBay and some idiot out there is dumb enough to buy it.

2205
02:59:10,700 --> 02:59:13,700
I don't know anyone who's done that.

2206
02:59:13,700 --> 02:59:22,700
You know, losing weight or having fun, you know, playing the game, just, you know, listening to music.

2207
02:59:22,700 --> 02:59:28,700
I might add that the terror alert was elevated at the time. Shut up.

2208
02:59:28,700 --> 02:59:32,700
Hey Jason, it sounds like you should be marketing this to adults. How much does this game cost?

2209
02:59:32,700 --> 02:59:36,700
Pause it. Pause it.

2210
02:59:36,700 --> 02:59:39,700
That is the funniest capture of him, by the way.

2211
02:59:39,700 --> 02:59:44,700
There are so many places you could go with this statement. It sounds like a game you should be marketing towards adults.

2212
02:59:44,700 --> 02:59:49,700
And why are we all on the Fox News Channel right now? Because I know so many children that watch the station.

2213
02:59:49,700 --> 02:59:55,700
And if you do know any children that watch Fox News Channel, they are being poisoned!

2214
02:59:55,700 --> 02:59:58,700
Turn them away! Make them watch Spongebob!

2215
03:00:00,700 --> 03:00:05,700
Well actually, good timing that you mentioned that. We just brought out our latest game, which is...

2216
03:00:05,700 --> 03:00:07,700
Pause it. Totally great.

2217
03:00:07,700 --> 03:00:12,840
I love the fact that Jason just happened why it's so funny. You should ask

2218
03:00:12,840 --> 03:00:19,340
I just happen to have the game right here in my hand. I'm so glad you asked see obviously he was prepped on his questions

2219
03:00:19,340 --> 03:00:21,100
But that's all right anyway

2220
03:00:21,100 --> 03:00:27,820
I'm positive stance Revolution extreme for the PlayStation 2 you can get the game to suggest a retail of $39.99

2221
03:00:28,100 --> 03:00:33,400
We also have a version that comes with the dance pad so you can get started right away for $59.99. Oh

2222
03:00:33,400 --> 03:00:37,400
Oh well, I'm going to have to ask our promo department if we've got any downstairs.

2223
03:00:37,400 --> 03:00:39,400
Pause it.

2224
03:00:39,400 --> 03:00:44,400
In other words, I'm too cheap to buy one myself.

2225
03:00:44,400 --> 03:00:46,400
Give me one for free, Jason, please.

2226
03:00:46,400 --> 03:00:49,400
I think we need to write a letter to them.

2227
03:00:49,400 --> 03:00:51,400
Please don't report on DDR, I guess.

2228
03:00:51,400 --> 03:00:52,400
Please don't report on anything.

2229
03:00:52,400 --> 03:00:53,400
Let us.

2230
03:00:53,400 --> 03:00:56,400
Fox News Channel is a horrible station. Anyway, pause it.

2231
03:00:56,400 --> 03:00:59,400
Thank you so much, Jason Enos and Don.

2232
03:00:59,400 --> 03:01:00,400
Enos!

2233
03:01:00,400 --> 03:01:01,840
Enos!

2234
03:01:01,840 --> 03:01:04,600
Let me talk about pronunciation here.

2235
03:01:04,600 --> 03:01:06,120
Does it look like there's an I?

2236
03:01:06,120 --> 03:01:07,440
Does it look like there's an E?

2237
03:01:07,440 --> 03:01:10,720
It's a fucking O. Enos!

2238
03:01:10,720 --> 03:01:12,200
It would even be, if you mispronounced it,

2239
03:01:12,200 --> 03:01:14,760
it would be like, you know, pot or something.

2240
03:01:14,760 --> 03:01:18,200
It'd be Enos, not Enus.

2241
03:01:18,200 --> 03:01:21,320
Enos, Enos, not Enus.

2242
03:01:21,320 --> 03:01:23,640
Might as well just call him Jason the Penis Man.

2243
03:01:23,640 --> 03:01:27,160
I mean, seriously, that's what you're fucking stupid.

2244
03:01:27,160 --> 03:01:30,920
learn to pronounce shit

2245
03:01:30,920 --> 03:01:35,160
well thank you mister enos and the little six-year-old from DDR freaks thank

2246
03:01:35,160 --> 03:01:37,000
you so much

2247
03:01:37,000 --> 03:01:37,760
I'm pausing

2248
03:01:37,760 --> 03:01:40,060
Don D'Amato, thank you very much

2249
03:01:40,060 --> 03:01:42,920
Greg? Thank you, Derek. Wait, wait, wait

2250
03:01:42,920 --> 03:01:45,520
that guy has such a porn star name too

2251
03:01:45,520 --> 03:01:49,200
Don D'Amato? That's kind of a porn star name, don't you think?

2252
03:01:49,200 --> 03:01:50,620
all right

2253
03:01:50,620 --> 03:01:53,640
can you uh... can you play the clip one more time

2254
03:01:53,640 --> 03:01:57,320
Cause I really quickly want to read for you guys the Fox facts

2255
03:01:57,320 --> 03:02:01,220
that scroll across the bottom of the screen. Pause it real fast before it starts. Because

2256
03:02:01,220 --> 03:02:04,740
not only do you have the little thing that rolls along the bottom of the screen,

2257
03:02:04,740 --> 03:02:08,380
but you have the little thing at the bottom with your facts, fast facts in it

2258
03:02:08,380 --> 03:02:11,520
and then everything else is going on. This is television for ADD. Yes, I realize we're

2259
03:02:11,520 --> 03:02:13,280
running over. I don't care.

2260
03:02:13,280 --> 03:02:14,600
Here's the fact number one.

2261
03:02:14,600 --> 03:02:18,600
Dancing video game can help kids lose weight.

2262
03:02:18,600 --> 03:02:23,600
or DDR, let's kids get their groove on and lose weight at the same time.

2263
03:02:23,600 --> 03:02:28,600
With us now, DDR product manager, Jason Enos and Don D'Amato,

2264
03:02:28,600 --> 03:02:33,600
member of a fan club called DDR Freaks, welcome both of you.

2265
03:02:33,600 --> 03:02:34,600
Thank you.

2266
03:02:34,600 --> 03:02:38,600
Jason, first why don't you explain to me what DDR is?

2267
03:02:38,600 --> 03:02:40,600
Well, Dance Science Revolution is an interactive...

2268
03:02:40,600 --> 03:02:42,600
Come on, get to the facts, I know the word. Oh, here we go.

2269
03:02:42,600 --> 03:02:44,600
Jason Enos, CDR project manager, we all know that.

2270
03:02:44,600 --> 03:02:56,560
we all know that. Enos has helped design numerous video games. Imagine that. He works for Konami

2271
03:02:56,560 --> 03:03:05,500
and he has helped design numerous video games. I never would have thought. 15% of American

2272
03:03:05,500 --> 03:03:07,900
kids are overweight or obese.

2273
03:03:07,900 --> 03:03:10,700
Okay, now that's a fact.

2274
03:03:10,700 --> 03:03:21,140
I'd like to add that Mel B was in this video.

2275
03:03:21,140 --> 03:03:29,260
I would be embarrassed to be on the station, but anyway.

2276
03:03:29,260 --> 03:03:30,260
Pause it.

2277
03:03:30,260 --> 03:03:34,260
Another 15% of kids are at risk of becoming overweight.

2278
03:03:34,260 --> 03:03:37,580
They are one Snickers bar away from DOOM!

2279
03:03:37,580 --> 03:03:39,540
Put that kid on Atkins right now!

2280
03:03:39,540 --> 03:03:42,980
Now the risk of them becoming overweight, is that meaning that they're at risk of the

2281
03:03:42,980 --> 03:03:44,740
overweight person eating them?

2282
03:03:44,740 --> 03:03:47,380
So therefore they are becoming part of the overweight person?

2283
03:03:47,380 --> 03:03:48,380
Whatever.

2284
03:03:48,380 --> 03:03:50,140
Anyways, back to it.

2285
03:03:50,140 --> 03:03:54,460
So Don, you are part of the DDR Freaks, and I just-

2286
03:03:54,460 --> 03:03:55,460
Pause it.

2287
03:03:55,460 --> 03:03:56,460
I can't resist.

2288
03:03:56,460 --> 03:03:58,860
Listen to how she's talking down to him.

2289
03:03:58,860 --> 03:04:02,540
So Don, you're part of the DDR Freaks.

2290
03:04:02,540 --> 03:04:05,820
you're not nine years old so we got to finish

2291
03:04:05,820 --> 03:04:14,480
unpause it over nine million American kids are overweight or obese so they've

2292
03:04:14,480 --> 03:04:18,460
taken that 15% and now they just blame for that mommy and daddy yeah I know I

2293
03:04:18,460 --> 03:04:26,060
know I'm 21 yeah yeah you know what I know people who are for and then his

2294
03:04:26,060 --> 03:04:30,220
course is named on the amato porn star and DDR freaks member teen years old I

2295
03:04:30,220 --> 03:04:32,220
I know people who are four years old- And it says DDR Freaks member.

2296
03:04:32,220 --> 03:04:34,220
I'm a gay and they all love the game.

2297
03:04:34,220 --> 03:04:37,220
D'Mato has played Dance Dance Revolution for years.

2298
03:04:37,220 --> 03:04:39,220
For whatever reason he-

2299
03:04:39,220 --> 03:04:44,220
Over ten percent of children aged two to five are overweight.

2300
03:04:44,220 --> 03:04:47,220
Because you so should get your two year old into DDR.

2301
03:04:47,220 --> 03:04:51,220
Two year olds aren't- yeah, those are the people that are fucking putting those stupid kids on the pads.

2302
03:04:51,220 --> 03:04:54,220
I want my fat bitch to get you!

2303
03:04:54,220 --> 03:04:57,220
Less fat, and less bitchy.

2304
03:04:57,220 --> 03:05:01,820
There's exercise or even competition.

2305
03:05:01,820 --> 03:05:06,460
Yeah, so since this story has kind of a serious angle, we're talking about obesity in kids,

2306
03:05:06,460 --> 03:05:07,900
tell me about the losing weight part.

2307
03:05:07,900 --> 03:05:09,860
Does it really make you work up a sweat?

2308
03:05:09,860 --> 03:05:12,020
It makes me work up a sweat.

2309
03:05:12,020 --> 03:05:15,780
It's really, you know, solid.

2310
03:05:15,780 --> 03:05:19,220
Kids need 60 minutes of activity a day for their health.

2311
03:05:19,220 --> 03:05:23,420
So kids start having sex early because you get 60 minutes of it every day.

2312
03:05:23,420 --> 03:05:31,180
can run you, you know, at a very slow pace. Approximately one half of kids do vigorous

2313
03:05:31,180 --> 03:05:37,700
physical activity regularly. Yes, I would like to readjust that number to about 99 percent

2314
03:05:37,700 --> 03:05:42,700
of teenagers who masturbate frequently. What arcade is that? I have no idea what arcade

2315
03:05:42,700 --> 03:05:48,140
it is. Does it look familiar to you or something? No. It could even run you at a very high pace.

2316
03:05:48,140 --> 03:05:52,600
Songs can run up to 300 BPM and, you know, a regular song on the radio can only go to

2317
03:05:52,600 --> 03:05:57,480
to about maybe 120. So maybe songs can end up being about three times as fast and moving

2318
03:05:57,480 --> 03:06:00,280
around three times as fast as any, you know, normal buddy.

2319
03:06:00,280 --> 03:06:03,160
And is this something like, I know like, EverQuest and...

2320
03:06:03,160 --> 03:06:08,360
Approximately one quarter of kids report no vigorous physical activity.

2321
03:06:08,360 --> 03:06:10,760
And the other one is more of the lying.

2322
03:06:10,760 --> 03:06:15,000
And the other... And that quarter would be the liars. No, I'm kidding. Anyway.

2323
03:06:15,000 --> 03:06:18,080
It means like that people do for hours and hours. Is this something that kids...

2324
03:06:18,080 --> 03:06:19,720
You can. You can find your...

2325
03:06:19,720 --> 03:06:22,600
That would be funny because if they muted out that it was about DDR.

2326
03:06:22,600 --> 03:06:25,640
So this is something you could do for hours and hours. You can! You can!

2327
03:06:25,640 --> 03:06:30,960
Oh, sorry. A quarter of U.S. kids spend four or more hours a day

2328
03:06:30,960 --> 03:06:35,460
watching TV. Could part of that four hours be watching TV

2329
03:06:35,460 --> 03:06:39,560
to, you know, see the arrows that are going up the screen to play the game?

2330
03:06:39,560 --> 03:06:43,560
I think they mean by actually watching television programming. Whatever.

2331
03:06:43,560 --> 03:06:47,400
Yourself saying, just one more song. Just one more song. I'll be right...

2332
03:06:47,400 --> 03:06:50,400
Just one more drink.

2333
03:06:50,400 --> 03:06:54,400
It gets your entire body into it, and you don't even pay attention to yourself

2334
03:06:54,400 --> 03:06:59,400
losing weight or having fun playing the game, just listening to music and dancing.

2335
03:06:59,400 --> 03:07:03,400
Hey, Jason, it sounds like you should be marketing this to adults. How much does this game cost?

2336
03:07:03,400 --> 03:07:04,400
No shit.

2337
03:07:04,400 --> 03:07:07,400
Actually, it's good timing that you eventually...

2338
03:07:07,400 --> 03:07:12,400
Pause it, pause it, pause it. Can you sense it a little bit in his reaction?

2339
03:07:12,400 --> 03:07:15,400
Can you sense it just a little bit in his reaction? He's just kind of like, no shit, lady.

2340
03:07:15,400 --> 03:07:18,280
lady what do you think I'm doing on your piece of shit television station I think

2341
03:07:18,280 --> 03:07:24,320
so I see it a little bit I'm not gonna say that's what he meant to say but we

2342
03:07:24,320 --> 03:07:29,520
just brought out our latest the next time I see him hopefully d3 is here I'm

2343
03:07:29,520 --> 03:07:34,520
gonna ask don't you think you should be marketing this game for adults see if he

2344
03:07:34,520 --> 03:07:40,500
gets the joke I'll so give you a dollar for that dance dance revolution extreme

2345
03:07:40,500 --> 03:07:44,360
for the PlayStation 2 you can get the fast facts went away so that we can see

2346
03:07:44,360 --> 03:07:50,360
We also have a version that comes with the dance pad so you can get started right away for $59.99.

2347
03:07:50,360 --> 03:07:53,360
Oh, wow. I'm going to have to ask our promo department if we've got...

2348
03:07:53,360 --> 03:07:54,360
Same one.

2349
03:07:54,360 --> 03:08:00,360
How many downstairs? That looks kind of good. Thank you so much, Jason Enos and Don DeMotto. Thank you very much.

2350
03:08:00,360 --> 03:08:01,360
You're welcome.

2351
03:08:01,360 --> 03:08:02,360
Greg?

2352
03:08:02,360 --> 03:08:03,360
Thank you, Derek.

2353
03:08:07,360 --> 03:08:09,360
And that's what we're here for.

2354
03:08:09,360 --> 03:08:12,360
Look at this. Our longest show ever, thanks to that little clip.

2355
03:08:12,360 --> 03:08:13,360
I need to go home.

2356
03:08:13,360 --> 03:08:15,840
You know what, it needed to be made fun of, though.

2357
03:08:15,840 --> 03:08:16,340
Oh, I know.

2358
03:08:16,340 --> 03:08:22,480
With all respect to Don and Jason for being good sports with that interview,

2359
03:08:22,480 --> 03:08:27,080
we just had to, I'll take any chance I can to make fun of Fox News.

2360
03:08:27,080 --> 03:08:29,560
Anyway, let's move on with our final thoughts.

2361
03:08:29,560 --> 03:08:31,440
We're going to wrap up this show.

2362
03:08:31,440 --> 03:08:32,720
We'll start off with our guests.

2363
03:08:32,720 --> 03:08:34,920
Start off with Jonas.

2364
03:08:34,920 --> 03:08:35,840
Jason Ennis.

2365
03:08:39,400 --> 03:08:39,920
Angel.

2366
03:08:39,920 --> 03:08:45,920
Um, I don't know. All I can think of is Final Fantasy level. Please kill me.

2367
03:08:45,920 --> 03:08:50,920
Addict. And, uh, we're out Katie in 42.

2368
03:08:50,920 --> 03:08:55,920
Last week is a tip, yay! Finally. Yay.

2369
03:08:55,920 --> 03:08:59,920
My thought is, we didn't even get through all of this week's news. That's how crazy of a week it was.

2370
03:08:59,920 --> 03:09:03,920
Why is it that the Bamani news always is like, all of a sudden it's all in one week?

2371
03:09:03,920 --> 03:09:05,920
We'll just have to carry it over to next week. We'll see.

2372
03:09:05,920 --> 03:09:08,920
And, uh, tune into our other shows too, please. Thanks.

2373
03:09:08,920 --> 03:09:16,920

2375
03:09:22,920 --> 03:09:26,920

03:09:26,920 --> 03:09:28,920
Alright, and uh...

2377
03:09:28,920 --> 03:09:29,920
Oh, I have one more thing.

2378
03:09:29,920 --> 03:09:30,920
What?

2379
03:09:30,920 --> 03:09:33,920
The only person you have to blame is yourself.

2380
03:09:33,920 --> 03:09:38,120

He's a private eye, a crooked cop, secret agent, and a celebrity pharmacist, dangerous.

2397
03:11:31,800 --> 03:11:40,800
That guy is dangerous, dangerous, dangerous, dangerous.

Fantasia mix so we don't know if this is the actual never-ending story

2410
03:12:52,100 --> 03:12:57,100
Okay, but it has Never Any Story and Fantasia. I mean, that's kinda not really a...

2411
03:12:57,100 --> 03:13:00,100
And it's Echo Image. How can you go wrong with this, no matter what it is?

03:15:15,100 --> 03:15:18,100
The yellow moon, the rainbow

2424
03:15:18,100 --> 03:15:23,100
Is the answer to a never ending show

2425
03:15:23,100 --> 03:15:29,100

2435
03:17:42,260 --> 03:17:47,460
a private message chat going back and forth, I want to have sex with that song. Down right.

2436
03:17:47,460 --> 03:17:52,540
That song is everything that I imagined it would be. Oh, that was so hot. It's so unbelievably

2437
03:17:52,540 --> 03:17:55,700
hot. I loved it. Which is why I had to download the rest of it. God damn it, why couldn't

2438
03:17:55,700 --> 03:17:59,660
you have put that in Caged Mesh. As much as I love Come Back, that would have been a much

2439
03:17:59,660 --> 03:18:04,140
better song. I know. I did download, what did I get earlier? I need to get that off

2440

Wow.

2449
03:18:34,260 --> 03:18:49,240
I swear to God, I'm gonna start like an echo image.

2450
03:18:49,240 --> 03:18:56,740
fansite on orsonsradio.com. I just, God, they are so good. Notes said, and I just noticed

2451
03:18:56,740 --> 03:19:00,100
this, now I don't know about this because I was looking at their discography, they only

2452
03:19:00,100 --> 03:19:04,720
have one album. I know. It's because people don't know it. One album. I'm spreading the

2453
03:19:04,720 --> 03:19:12,300
word. Don't download this shit. Go buy the album, you won't regret it. I swear you won't.

2454
03:19:12,300 --> 03:19:15,900
And as soon as I can find a copy of the album, I'm going to buy it legitimately too, I swear.

2455
03:19:15,900 --> 03:19:16,900
I'm going to order it on Amazon.

2456
03:19:16,900 --> 03:19:20,620
I know to god that they, what they really need to do, and I'm really saying, cause I'm

2457
03:19:20,620 --> 03:19:24,300
going to need to do this, they need to gather all these artists on this label here, this,

2458
03:19:24,300 --> 03:19:28,660
um, I forget what it's called now, but anyways, gather all the artists, throw a concert.

2459
03:19:28,660 --> 03:19:30,460
Just even like two cities or something.

2460
03:19:30,460 --> 03:19:34,740
I know it's, I know it's expensive to throw a concert, but these are like artists that

2461
03:19:34,740 --> 03:19:35,740
no one's ever heard of.

2462
03:19:35,740 --> 03:19:39,460
Maybe you get the label to come on, you know, chip in a little bit of money, you know, or

2463
03:19:39,460 --> 03:19:45,000
even just one concert, I mean, something like that, and promote DDR that way.

2464
03:19:45,000 --> 03:19:47,760
have a concert you have these artists that no one's ever listened to they

2465
03:19:47,760 --> 03:19:53,160
become fans you grow a fan base and then you can use them again use I mean all

2466
03:19:53,160 --> 03:19:58,520
All these other songs that Echo Image has done definitely could be used in DDR, so...
