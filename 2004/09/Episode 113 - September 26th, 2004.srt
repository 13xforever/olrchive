[SPEAKER_07]: You're not going to... Sorry, DDR Angel.

00:04:12,779 --> 00:04:13,219
[SPEAKER_13]: Very good.

46
00:04:13,635 --> 00:04:14,996
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you're just Angel for short now.

47
00:04:15,276 --> 00:04:15,856
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, damn it.

48
00:04:16,017 --> 00:04:16,457
[SPEAKER_13]: Fine.

00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:18,258
[SPEAKER_07]: D-E-R Angel USA.

00:04:18,338 --> 00:04:19,199
[SPEAKER_07]: That's your new name now.

51
00:04:20,679 --> 00:04:24,402
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, at least you didn't put 2X Angel, Pop Music Angel, whatever else.

52
00:04:24,442 --> 00:04:25,683
[SPEAKER_07]: You got the shitty mic, just to warn you.

53
00:04:25,703 --> 00:04:27,224
[SPEAKER_07]: You gotta hold it at the bottom when you're talking it.

54
00:04:27,504 --> 00:04:27,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Careful.

55
00:04:27,944 --> 00:04:29,685
[SPEAKER_13]: I got the shitty mic right here.

56
00:04:29,725 --> 00:04:30,486
[SPEAKER_07]: You go, girl.

57
00:04:30,646 --> 00:04:31,086
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

58
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:35,009
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

59
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:35,489
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway.

60
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,450
[SPEAKER_13]: Did they even get what I said or no?

61
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, they heard most of it.

62
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:46,652
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not going to go there.

63
00:04:47,192 --> 00:04:48,273
[SPEAKER_13]: Stop sending them hurricanes.

64
00:04:52,615 --> 00:04:55,797
[SPEAKER_07]: We had a really big show tonight, and I'm very disappointed.

65
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:59,379
[SPEAKER_07]: We only have about half our usual listeners tuned in right now.

66
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,259
[SPEAKER_07]: Shame on you!

67
00:05:00,339 --> 00:05:01,120
[SPEAKER_04]: You're watching football.

68
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:04,561
[SPEAKER_04]: That was after I did the show last week.

69
00:05:04,581 --> 00:05:07,143
[SPEAKER_07]: They were all scared off from the Loki experience last week.

70
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:08,999
[SPEAKER_07]: DDR Xtreme USA Music

71
00:05:38,402 --> 00:05:39,803
[SPEAKER_07]: and a whole lot of other Bomani news.

72
00:05:39,823 --> 00:05:40,783
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just been a busy week.

73
00:05:41,304 --> 00:05:44,686
[SPEAKER_07]: God, we might have to actually stay on topic tonight.

74
00:05:45,966 --> 00:05:46,286
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

75
00:05:46,887 --> 00:05:57,633
[SPEAKER_07]: You're right, but first we're going to do How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day when we get back from this break featuring licensed music from DDR Extreme USA including what I believe would be Jamie's favorite licensed song.

76
00:05:59,594 --> 00:06:02,336
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an old 80s song by a British lady.

77
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:03,996
[SPEAKER_07]: She's a little wild.

78
00:06:04,937 --> 00:06:05,577
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, here it is.

79
00:06:05,737 --> 00:06:06,078
[SPEAKER_07]: Enjoy.

80
00:06:06,118 --> 00:06:06,558
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be back.

81
00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:12,510
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for watching.

82
00:06:51,756 --> 00:06:52,916
Thanks for watching!

83
00:07:31,902 --> 00:07:32,268
DarkSakura

84
00:08:09,173 --> 00:08:10,154
Thanks for watching!

85
00:09:19,614 --> 00:09:20,635
DarkSakura.com

86
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:48,156
Love, love, love, love

87
00:10:06,532 --> 00:10:18,282
[SPEAKER_19]: Simply Be In Love Simply Be In Love Simply Be In Love Simply Be In Love Simply Be In Love Simply Be In Love

88
00:10:34,803 --> 00:10:41,686
[SPEAKER_19]: Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

89
00:11:05,671 --> 00:11:14,033
[SPEAKER_07]: We are back with Orange Lounge Radio, and of course tonight, big news, lots of news in the video game world this week.

90
00:11:14,053 --> 00:11:21,576
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a game that came out that we've all finally been looking forward to, and thusly, we're going to dedicate tonight's entire show to this game.

91
00:11:21,996 --> 00:11:24,376
[SPEAKER_07]: Hooray for Final Fantasy XI Chains of Promethea.

92
00:11:24,516 --> 00:11:26,277
[SPEAKER_17]: No, no bullshit.

93
00:11:26,857 --> 00:11:27,798
[SPEAKER_17]: It's been two.

94
00:11:30,466 --> 00:11:31,407
[SPEAKER_17]: No way.

95
00:11:31,467 --> 00:11:32,449
[SPEAKER_17]: I like both of those.

96
00:11:32,689 --> 00:11:33,430
[SPEAKER_17]: I need The Sims 2.

97
00:11:33,491 --> 00:11:37,036
[SPEAKER_17]: You need to kill them in more original ways and better graphics.

98
00:11:37,237 --> 00:11:42,345
[SPEAKER_17]: A certain former intern of ours has my copies and claims to have lost them.

99
00:11:42,686 --> 00:11:42,926
[SPEAKER_30]: Dope.

100
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:51,054
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

101
00:12:07,006 --> 00:12:08,126
[SPEAKER_07]: I just thought it was hilarious.

102
00:12:08,206 --> 00:12:14,668
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's great that you can kind of just whisk yourself away into the imaginary world of Sims 2 where you can live out your sexual fantasies.

103
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:18,289
[SPEAKER_04]: I am going to kill the Olsen twins in a pool.

104
00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:20,329
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to be awesome.

105
00:12:21,129 --> 00:12:21,990
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't wait.

106
00:12:26,191 --> 00:12:32,152
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to build the house of all pool so I can take all the people I hate and have them drown there.

107
00:12:32,882 --> 00:12:36,783
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, Sigurd's posting in the chatroom that it was him, so I can say it was Sigurd.

108
00:12:36,863 --> 00:12:39,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Sigurd sent me all these pictures of him living out his fantasy.

109
00:12:40,744 --> 00:12:48,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, you can, um, what's great is, I, like, saw, did a review on somethingawful.com about it, and apparently there's, like, three different cities you can start in.

110
00:12:48,585 --> 00:12:52,846
[SPEAKER_04]: One's, like, completely medieval, and there's, like, some other strange one, and some other thing.

111
00:12:53,046 --> 00:12:57,787
[SPEAKER_04]: But what's cool, though, is you can make, like, three and four story tall buildings and stuff in this.

112
00:12:58,047 --> 00:12:58,987
[SPEAKER_17]: Can you push people off?

113
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:03,503
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, but he had really creepy, fuzzy chairs.

114
00:13:05,144 --> 00:13:08,226
[SPEAKER_04]: And he kept all of the dead up in his, like, roof.

115
00:13:08,507 --> 00:13:11,789
[SPEAKER_17]: My question is if the Rosebud Code still works.

116
00:13:13,371 --> 00:13:14,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, from the old-ass Sims City?

117
00:13:16,473 --> 00:13:16,953
[SPEAKER_05]: Good question.

118
00:13:16,973 --> 00:13:17,994
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a question.

119
00:13:18,094 --> 00:13:19,996
[SPEAKER_07]: You know how they had, like, a Sims that came out a while ago?

120
00:13:20,016 --> 00:13:21,357
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like the Sims Herbs.

121
00:13:21,857 --> 00:13:23,919
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, it was the urban version of the Sims.

122
00:13:24,339 --> 00:13:25,320
[SPEAKER_07]: It came out not that long ago.

123
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,502
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to know if you have drive-bys in that game.

124
00:13:27,562 --> 00:13:28,342
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be awesome.

125
00:13:28,422 --> 00:13:29,203
[SPEAKER_17]: That would be awesome.

126
00:13:30,678 --> 00:13:32,459
[SPEAKER_04]: That's San Andreas.

127
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:33,960
[SPEAKER_07]: Different game.

128
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,641
[SPEAKER_07]: They need Grand Theft Sims.

129
00:13:35,801 --> 00:13:36,541
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what we need.

130
00:13:39,803 --> 00:13:43,044
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, yes, we do have to tip our hat.

131
00:13:43,264 --> 00:13:50,068
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie doesn't have to tip her hat, but Matt and I have to tip our hats to Final Fantasy XI Chains of Promethea because we've been waiting for that game for a while.

132
00:13:50,782 --> 00:13:57,246
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had the game now for almost 48 hours, or at least 24 hours, and have not been to any of the new areas.

133
00:13:57,987 --> 00:13:59,008
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the beautiful part.

134
00:13:59,108 --> 00:14:05,252
[SPEAKER_07]: We've had the game for a day and a half, and it's been installed, and I have yet to see any differences except one new song.

135
00:14:07,033 --> 00:14:08,854
[SPEAKER_07]: Beautiful waste of $30.

136
00:14:09,094 --> 00:14:10,896
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what, dear, dear addicts?

137
00:14:11,576 --> 00:14:11,856
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes?

138
00:14:12,837 --> 00:14:15,199
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm still playing Ragnarok Online for free!

139
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Zelda Online, they do have...

140
00:14:20,891 --> 00:14:21,752
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so cool!

141
00:14:22,772 --> 00:14:25,954
[SPEAKER_17]: I could go play the Satella view, Zelda, on my computer.

142
00:14:26,155 --> 00:14:27,275
[SPEAKER_17]: And I have to deal with people.

143
00:14:28,176 --> 00:14:28,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

144
00:14:30,097 --> 00:14:31,338
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, we're getting off subject.

145
00:14:31,378 --> 00:14:37,302
[SPEAKER_07]: We have to go back to our roots, and we have to do what this show is all about in the beginnings of the first chapter.

146
00:14:38,563 --> 00:14:39,023
[SPEAKER_07]: No, not that.

147
00:14:39,063 --> 00:14:39,483
[SPEAKER_07]: Not that yet.

148
00:14:40,044 --> 00:14:43,886
[SPEAKER_17]: But, um, we have to do... The Athens game, I know.

149
00:14:44,727 --> 00:14:45,007
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no.

150
00:14:45,187 --> 00:14:45,728
[SPEAKER_07]: How was your week?

151
00:14:45,768 --> 00:14:46,328
[SPEAKER_07]: How was your day?

152
00:14:46,768 --> 00:14:47,909
[SPEAKER_07]: The greatest game of all time.

153
00:14:48,329 --> 00:14:49,130
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, okay.

154
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:50,171
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie, how was your week?

155
00:14:50,211 --> 00:14:50,611
[SPEAKER_07]: How was your day?

156
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:57,573
[SPEAKER_17]: Last week, not this like very past, but the week before, I was... Sorry, how was your two weeks?

157
00:14:57,633 --> 00:14:58,073
[SPEAKER_07]: How was your day?

158
00:14:58,173 --> 00:14:59,234
[SPEAKER_17]: I was a wreck.

159
00:15:00,415 --> 00:15:02,816
[SPEAKER_17]: Because the hurricane hit Mobile, Alabama.

160
00:15:03,256 --> 00:15:04,056
[SPEAKER_17]: Guess where I'm from?

161
00:15:05,397 --> 00:15:06,298
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll take Mobile for $200.

162
00:15:06,498 --> 00:15:07,498
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not from Kansas.

163
00:15:07,938 --> 00:15:08,459
Anymore.

164
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:09,039
[SPEAKER_17]: Anymore.

165
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,221
[SPEAKER_17]: As if I ever was.

166
00:15:12,501 --> 00:15:16,623
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway, yeah, I was up that Wednesday night just watching the news.

167
00:15:16,923 --> 00:15:19,704
[SPEAKER_17]: Because they had a live feed from one of the local stations in Mobile.

168
00:15:19,724 --> 00:15:20,505
[SPEAKER_17]: So I was watching...

169
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:22,011
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, the pressure, yeah.

170
00:15:22,311 --> 00:15:22,631
[SPEAKER_17]: So, uh...

171
00:15:48,772 --> 00:15:59,814
[SPEAKER_17]: But luckily, when the north eyewall was going to hit Mobile Bay, and they were expecting it to surge all the water up through the bay and flood all of downtown, you know, hence Water Street.

172
00:16:00,415 --> 00:16:07,556
[SPEAKER_17]: But instead it sucked out all the water, so it's kind of stunk there for a little bit, but there wasn't any extraneous flooding.

173
00:16:08,136 --> 00:16:11,297
[SPEAKER_17]: It blew over a bunch of stuff, knocked down some trees, but there were no casualties in Mobile.

174
00:16:12,357 --> 00:16:12,937
[SPEAKER_17]: That's good.

175
00:16:13,117 --> 00:16:15,778
[SPEAKER_17]: And there were no serious injuries reported.

176
00:16:15,798 --> 00:16:16,078
[SPEAKER_17]: Mm-hmm.

177
00:16:16,331 --> 00:16:20,212
[SPEAKER_17]: However, Tornadoes decided to drop down in the town I was born in, in Dothan, Alabama.

178
00:16:20,352 --> 00:16:20,572
[SPEAKER_17]: Dope.

179
00:16:21,012 --> 00:16:22,053
[SPEAKER_17]: Tore up a bunch of trailer parks.

180
00:16:23,013 --> 00:16:24,473
[SPEAKER_17]: And nearly hit my granny's house.

181
00:16:25,934 --> 00:16:27,694
[SPEAKER_17]: It still dealt like a block from her house.

182
00:16:27,914 --> 00:16:28,435
[SPEAKER_07]: But it missed her?

183
00:16:28,755 --> 00:16:29,095
[SPEAKER_07]: It missed her.

184
00:16:29,115 --> 00:16:29,495
[SPEAKER_07]: That's good.

185
00:16:29,515 --> 00:16:31,976
[SPEAKER_17]: You have a hit movie gallery.

186
00:16:32,996 --> 00:16:36,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Their headquarters happens to be in Dothan, Alabama, and I fucking hate them.

187
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:42,873
[SPEAKER_17]: Dude, I used to go to, like, one of the movie galleries out there that were, like, the crappiest place in the world.

188
00:16:42,893 --> 00:16:43,933
[SPEAKER_04]: They are the crappiest place.

189
00:16:43,953 --> 00:16:50,917
[SPEAKER_04]: They buy out mom-and-pop stores that replace all the employees with retards, and then they just, like, run the business.

190
00:16:51,117 --> 00:16:52,678
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you're missing movies, right?

191
00:16:52,938 --> 00:16:55,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, we've only checked the first box so far.

192
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, why don't you check the second box?

193
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that's where your movies are.

194
00:16:59,341 --> 00:16:59,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

195
00:17:00,251 --> 00:17:12,214
[SPEAKER_07]: On a serious note, before Jamie gets back to her story, just, you know, we hope that all you guys are safe from Ivan, and we hope everything's alright with you guys, our thoughts are with you guys, and if you're in Florida right now, RUN!

196
00:17:12,754 --> 00:17:13,514
[SPEAKER_06]: RUN AWAY!

197
00:17:14,335 --> 00:17:15,595
[SPEAKER_06]: THERE'S A HURRICANE COMING!

198
00:17:17,135 --> 00:17:18,836
[SPEAKER_06]: PICK UP YOUR PLAYSTATION AND RUN!

199
00:17:20,236 --> 00:17:22,577
[SPEAKER_07]: No, seriously, we hope everything's alright with you guys.

200
00:17:22,597 --> 00:17:27,758
[SPEAKER_17]: This has just been sort of, I mean, it hasn't ever happened like this before.

201
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:30,516
[SPEAKER_07]: Unless your last name is Bush, then by all means, stay.

202
00:17:32,257 --> 00:17:46,748
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what, at this point though, after having a whole week filled with seeing the debates between those two particular presidential candidates, and by the way people, more than two people are running for the presidency, hello!

203
00:17:47,288 --> 00:17:49,090
[SPEAKER_17]: There are other parties to choose from.

204
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:52,873
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll never... That's because people are stupid.

205
00:17:53,473 --> 00:17:55,875
[SPEAKER_04]: It's more like jogging, or brisk walking.

206
00:17:57,782 --> 00:17:58,002
[SPEAKER_17]: What?

207
00:17:59,003 --> 00:18:00,203
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like Coke and Pepsi.

208
00:18:00,504 --> 00:18:02,124
[SPEAKER_17]: You can drink other sodas.

209
00:18:02,205 --> 00:18:02,605
[SPEAKER_17]: Hello.

210
00:18:03,905 --> 00:18:06,527
[SPEAKER_17]: Shasta and Fanta and Bosco.

211
00:18:07,908 --> 00:18:08,408
[SPEAKER_17]: Those are good.

212
00:18:09,709 --> 00:18:10,509
[SPEAKER_17]: You can drink root beer.

213
00:18:10,809 --> 00:18:12,030
[SPEAKER_17]: You don't have to drink Sprite or Coke.

214
00:18:13,311 --> 00:18:14,592
[SPEAKER_17]: But anyway, yeah.

215
00:18:16,633 --> 00:18:21,495
[SPEAKER_17]: So I've just decided that neither candidate is worth my precious vote.

216
00:18:22,156 --> 00:18:23,517
[SPEAKER_17]: So I want them both to burn in hell.

217
00:18:25,198 --> 00:18:25,898
[SPEAKER_17]: I vote for Billy Capp.

218
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:28,060
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh hell yeah, I'm voting for Build-A-Cat.

219
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:33,664
[SPEAKER_17]: Although, something that was in, I've actually put a link up in my live journal a couple days ago.

220
00:18:34,184 --> 00:18:38,287
[SPEAKER_17]: Apparently, there's a couple other candidates, but I'll mention that later.

221
00:18:39,027 --> 00:18:40,448
[SPEAKER_17]: That I would be considered voting for.

222
00:18:40,929 --> 00:18:41,269
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

223
00:18:41,969 --> 00:18:42,970
[SPEAKER_17]: I might vote for the gay penguin.

224
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:49,594
[SPEAKER_17]: But nah, I'm voting for Build-A-Cat and Opus, Radical Meadow Party.

225
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:53,557
[SPEAKER_17]: Like I always do, because there's never been anybody worth voting for.

226
00:18:54,249 --> 00:18:56,049
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to remember to turn in my registration form.

227
00:18:56,629 --> 00:18:57,410
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to mail it back.

228
00:18:58,410 --> 00:18:59,550
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, shame on me, because I've moved.

229
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:05,071
[SPEAKER_17]: But I otherwise went to school, yay.

230
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:06,991
[SPEAKER_17]: Did homework, yay.

231
00:19:07,031 --> 00:19:08,431
[SPEAKER_17]: We got slow at work, finally.

232
00:19:09,032 --> 00:19:10,932
[SPEAKER_17]: So I've been writing fanfiction at work.

233
00:19:11,452 --> 00:19:11,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Productive.

234
00:19:11,952 --> 00:19:13,112
[SPEAKER_17]: Because I'm bored.

235
00:19:13,972 --> 00:19:15,793
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know, I've been doing other stuff, too.

236
00:19:16,073 --> 00:19:22,294
[SPEAKER_17]: And today, Dan and I had a very interesting conversation about that supposed draft coming up for vote.

237
00:19:25,183 --> 00:19:32,447
[SPEAKER_17]: First of all, I don't think that anyone needs to worry about it, because how many years have they tried to bring it back and not enacted it?

238
00:19:33,288 --> 00:19:48,137
[SPEAKER_17]: But even so, I mean, where it's not good for the forward-thinking, general, middle-class people, it would be a really good thing, though, for all of the people who are out there, like,

239
00:19:49,947 --> 00:19:52,589
[SPEAKER_17]: I will become gay not to go in the military.

240
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:53,070
[SPEAKER_17]: I will take one.

241
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:22,866
[SPEAKER_07]: There's going to be... I'm just saying, if they do bring back the draft, there's going to be a... It's going to be the new fad.

242
00:20:22,926 --> 00:20:25,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Instead of moving to Canada, everybody's going to start sucking dick.

243
00:20:25,609 --> 00:20:33,076
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's going to be... There's going to be this big, huge inconsistency that's going to have to be addressed at some point.

244
00:20:33,116 --> 00:20:35,938
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I don't think it's going to be... Overall, it's going to be good for...

245
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:45,428
[SPEAKER_17]: Good for the military itself, you know, to have a bunch of people there who they're not going to have time and resources to train properly and who aren't going to really want to be there.

246
00:20:46,168 --> 00:20:59,121
[SPEAKER_17]: But on the other hand, you know, for, especially for larger cities that are dealing with, you know, high crime, you know, high, I'm trying to, right now I just lost the word I was thinking of.

247
00:20:59,986 --> 00:21:10,154
[SPEAKER_17]: But overall, I think that it could improve things on a social scale, but there's so many drawbacks to it otherwise, I don't know that I'd be able to support anything like it.

248
00:21:10,355 --> 00:21:11,375
[SPEAKER_17]: But my fiancé's all for it.

249
00:21:11,956 --> 00:21:15,479
[SPEAKER_17]: I told him they should have made it 30 so I could go.

250
00:21:18,021 --> 00:21:23,626
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd freaking volunteer, I don't care, except we've got that little issue with me and him right now about it.

251
00:21:24,486 --> 00:21:25,107
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm working on it.

252
00:21:25,587 --> 00:21:26,628
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see what happens.

253
00:21:27,068 --> 00:21:27,589
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm working on it.

254
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:29,010
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything else you want to share?

255
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,861
[SPEAKER_17]: No, except Dark Knight is pretty damn funny.

256
00:21:59,266 --> 00:22:02,189
[SPEAKER_04]: by the doctor to fix my ingrown toenail.

257
00:22:02,209 --> 00:22:03,250
[SPEAKER_17]: Was he the evil doctor?

258
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:04,351
[SPEAKER_04]: No, he wasn't an evil doctor.

259
00:22:04,371 --> 00:22:05,252
[SPEAKER_04]: It only took a couple minutes.

260
00:22:05,512 --> 00:22:06,373
[SPEAKER_04]: But it hurts like a bitch.

261
00:22:06,633 --> 00:22:07,794
[SPEAKER_17]: He wasn't even moderately evil?

262
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:09,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

263
00:22:10,136 --> 00:22:15,181
[SPEAKER_04]: He talked about... What was he... He was rambling on about something that was like mad cow disease, but it was in deer.

264
00:22:15,681 --> 00:22:17,103
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess mad deer disease.

265
00:22:17,303 --> 00:22:18,163
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what the hell.

266
00:22:18,864 --> 00:22:25,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, this is something like... Something to keep me focused on something other than, you know, them...

267
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Poking my foot with needles.

268
00:22:27,701 --> 00:22:27,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Ow.

269
00:22:28,281 --> 00:22:29,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways.

270
00:22:29,542 --> 00:22:31,642
[SPEAKER_04]: And, yeah, so that hurts.

271
00:22:31,722 --> 00:22:32,983
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been hobbling around for days.

272
00:22:33,343 --> 00:22:36,544
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just, today I ripped the bandage off because I'm supposed to.

273
00:22:37,004 --> 00:22:50,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently I forgot a process of the bandage ripping off where I'm supposed to soak my toe in cold water and a little bit of hydrogen peroxide to loosen the impacted bandages in there.

274
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:53,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I forgot about that, so I just kind of pulled.

275
00:22:54,367 --> 00:23:23,606
[SPEAKER_04]: and with the polling came the yanking and then came the bleeding and that came the hurting so that really sucked and um so then there's that and then earlier this week I got DDR Extreme I did a show people got bored so I stopped the show and then I did a show last Sunday and people got bored and we did a segment called Crank Call Orange on his radio and I hung up on someone and that was funny and then um

276
00:23:24,898 --> 00:23:25,238
[SPEAKER_04]: What else?

277
00:23:25,398 --> 00:23:34,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, and then, let's see, you got Chains of Promethea, didn't really do anything, leveled some characters, and played a lot of Final Fantasy because I couldn't really go out and be active.

278
00:23:35,846 --> 00:23:47,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and got a book about my device, the Skull Experiment is what the book's called, and read it, and apparently my device may be a little bit harder to get working than I thought, but that's okay.

279
00:23:48,376 --> 00:23:49,096
[SPEAKER_04]: I can still do it.

280
00:23:51,458 --> 00:23:52,719
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's it.

281
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:57,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and I broke the lamp on Wednesday.

282
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:58,030
[SPEAKER_04]: That was funny.

283
00:24:00,652 --> 00:24:00,972
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

284
00:24:01,772 --> 00:24:02,513
[SPEAKER_07]: Angel, how was your week?

285
00:24:02,533 --> 00:24:02,893
[SPEAKER_07]: How was your day?

286
00:24:04,474 --> 00:24:04,934
[SPEAKER_13]: Pretty good.

287
00:24:05,715 --> 00:24:09,237
[SPEAKER_13]: Worked a lot and, you know, did what I was supposed to do.

288
00:24:09,717 --> 00:24:10,558
[SPEAKER_13]: Went to school.

289
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:11,538
[SPEAKER_13]: School was okay.

290
00:24:11,578 --> 00:24:13,419
[SPEAKER_13]: School was, well, school.

291
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,523
[SPEAKER_13]: And I actually got some good news from my folks, actually.

292
00:24:20,164 --> 00:24:24,126
[SPEAKER_13]: I called them on, what was it?

293
00:24:26,896 --> 00:24:45,203
[SPEAKER_13]: I had asked them if they had gotten hold of my brother and my sister-in-law and the baby and everything, and well, it turns out they're okay, so that was like a pressure off my shoulders that you wouldn't believe, except for you, Jamie, because, you know, your family and everything.

294
00:24:45,948 --> 00:25:07,301
[SPEAKER_13]: so, uh, yeah, that was just, I was just so thankful that, you know, the kid was okay, and, uh, their family's okay, and, yeah, so, that was, that was just the highlight of the week, pretty much, oh, yeah, and Extreme, and Andrew's command mission, oh, boy, Mega Man, more Mega Man, yay, oh, wait, if he was listening, oh, wait, he's not listening, haha, I'm safe,

295
00:25:08,032 --> 00:25:15,438
[SPEAKER_04]: See, I wanted to see, you know, I was waiting for, you know, a goddamn title match between Mike Tyson versus, you know, Hurricane Ivan.

296
00:25:15,918 --> 00:25:19,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I think that would be really sweet, and they could totally set that kind of stuff up.

297
00:25:20,081 --> 00:25:23,324
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, and Tyson's not doing anything.

298
00:25:23,404 --> 00:25:26,166
[SPEAKER_04]: He's just being bankrupt.

299
00:25:26,926 --> 00:25:27,887
[SPEAKER_04]: So, they could do it.

300
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:33,881
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, and I'm probably going to get Final Fantasy XI this week, I guess.

301
00:25:34,962 --> 00:25:40,247
[SPEAKER_13]: And become the... I don't know, I'll probably be sucked up into it and stuff.

302
00:25:41,408 --> 00:25:41,748
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe.

303
00:25:43,049 --> 00:25:44,350
[SPEAKER_13]: Or I'll just go back to there.

304
00:25:45,931 --> 00:25:46,692
[SPEAKER_13]: Or Ragnarok.

305
00:25:48,974 --> 00:25:52,617
[SPEAKER_13]: Or Ragnarok, or... God, I could just go anywhere, couldn't I?

306
00:25:52,797 --> 00:25:53,838
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh well, whatever.

307
00:25:53,978 --> 00:25:56,540
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, if anybody wants to know about there, go to there.com.

308
00:25:57,081 --> 00:25:58,562
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, okay, that's my little spiel.

309
00:25:58,582 --> 00:25:58,842
[SPEAKER_13]: Goodbye.

310
00:26:00,503 --> 00:26:00,743
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

311
00:26:00,883 --> 00:26:01,803
[SPEAKER_07]: Bradley, do you have a mic over there?

312
00:26:01,923 --> 00:26:02,263
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, goody.

313
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:03,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Bradley, how was your week?

314
00:26:03,303 --> 00:26:03,664
[SPEAKER_07]: How was your day?

315
00:26:03,704 --> 00:26:03,924
[SPEAKER_07]: I do.

316
00:26:04,824 --> 00:26:06,764
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, uh, this week was work, of course.

317
00:26:07,284 --> 00:26:14,625
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, Wednesday I came over here and did the... played some DDR USA Extreme, or whatever it's called.

318
00:26:15,386 --> 00:26:16,126
[SPEAKER_11]: Extreme USA.

319
00:26:16,846 --> 00:26:18,926
[SPEAKER_11]: Wasn't particularly impressed, but it was alright.

320
00:26:20,386 --> 00:26:26,287
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, then... And actually, I think that was the first time I played DDR in... in months.

321
00:26:28,228 --> 00:26:29,228
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, let's see, then...

322
00:26:30,546 --> 00:26:31,647
[SPEAKER_11]: Saturday didn't do very much.

323
00:26:32,127 --> 00:26:42,496
[SPEAKER_11]: Got the thing about the initiatives for the state ballot on November and got to see the two that I had did the temp job with.

324
00:26:42,836 --> 00:26:54,665
[SPEAKER_11]: Because one of my temp jobs during November, March and April was basically checking petitions for the stem cell one and the lawsuits one.

325
00:26:55,746 --> 00:26:58,328
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd say, oh, there's what I was working on.

326
00:26:58,809 --> 00:26:59,069
[SPEAKER_08]: Huh.

327
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:00,469
[SPEAKER_11]: which was interesting.

328
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:12,378
[SPEAKER_11]: And then Thursday or Friday I had a bunch of old Best Buy gift certificates.

329
00:27:12,418 --> 00:27:20,763
[SPEAKER_11]: I went and got the Aqua Teen Hunger Force DVDs and watched that most of the time.

330
00:27:20,923 --> 00:27:21,184
[SPEAKER_11]: Cool.

331
00:27:21,424 --> 00:27:21,864
[SPEAKER_11]: Those are fun.

332
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:24,046
[SPEAKER_11]: Today I didn't do very much.

333
00:27:24,246 --> 00:27:25,507
[SPEAKER_11]: I came here and that's all.

334
00:27:27,328 --> 00:27:27,648
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

335
00:27:28,024 --> 00:27:32,167
[SPEAKER_07]: My week and my day, actually my past two weeks because I wasn't here on Sunday because I was on a business trip.

336
00:27:32,587 --> 00:27:38,471
[SPEAKER_07]: I was in the lovely town of Allentown, Pennsylvania, which is about an hour north of Philly, about an hour west of Jersey.

337
00:27:40,752 --> 00:27:42,773
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, just kind of did my thing there.

338
00:27:43,714 --> 00:27:45,095
[SPEAKER_07]: Didn't get to play a whole lot of DDR.

339
00:27:45,115 --> 00:27:50,038
[SPEAKER_07]: I was actually thinking I was going to get to go out and play more DDR, but I was still working a lot this time around and...

340
00:27:50,728 --> 00:27:54,609
[SPEAKER_07]: It was kind of one of those things where when I was done working at the end of the day, I didn't really want to go out.

341
00:27:54,669 --> 00:27:58,310
[SPEAKER_07]: I just kind of wanted to go back to my hotel and watch TV and sleep, so I didn't really do a whole lot.

342
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:03,311
[SPEAKER_07]: But I did go out one night to a little mall out there in the area, which did have a DDR machine.

343
00:28:03,691 --> 00:28:06,651
[SPEAKER_07]: I was actually going to Walden Books there in the mall because I wanted to pick up some books.

344
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:09,732
[SPEAKER_07]: But they happen to have a DDR machine, and you know me, I can't pass it up.

345
00:28:10,252 --> 00:28:14,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, it was a Namco arcade, I believe, because they had Pac-Man stuff all over.

346
00:28:16,273 --> 00:28:17,013
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't remember the name of it.

347
00:28:17,073 --> 00:28:18,154
[SPEAKER_07]: Time something?

348
00:28:18,194 --> 00:28:19,454
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what the hell it was called.

349
00:28:20,152 --> 00:28:21,214
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

350
00:28:41,197 --> 00:28:46,039
[SPEAKER_07]: and it even impressed this one girl and she just started randomly talking to me and she's like, are you freaked out by strangers talking to you?

351
00:28:46,059 --> 00:28:46,699
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, not really.

352
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,901
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm kind of lonely and sad because I'm by myself in a strange town.

353
00:28:50,501 --> 00:28:54,824
[SPEAKER_07]: But she talked to me a little bit and that was cool.

354
00:28:55,084 --> 00:28:56,204
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't plug the show though.

355
00:28:56,325 --> 00:28:58,126
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you should listen to my radio show.

356
00:28:59,046 --> 00:29:00,387
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, bad me.

357
00:29:01,337 --> 00:29:11,393
[SPEAKER_07]: But then, okay, but then maybe I was just being an egotist or something, but I was looking at the scoreboards on the machine, and the Pop 4 difficult scores were kind of...

358
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:22,670
[SPEAKER_07]: Eh, like I was like, I could get that, you know, like, and so I really wanted to do it, and not, I'm usually not a scoreboard whore, but how cool would it have been to have my name on a machine like thousands of miles away, right?

359
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:34,977
[SPEAKER_07]: So I had to do it, so I put my coins in, I started to do it, and then the fucking pad, like, wouldn't work, like, it was just totally not registering, like, half my steps, and I fucking failed on, what, Irresistible Mind, like, standard, I failed that.

360
00:29:37,118 --> 00:29:38,339
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh well, what can you do?

361
00:29:40,579 --> 00:29:44,517
[SPEAKER_07]: So much for that, trying to get my name on the scoreboard at the Lehigh Valley Mall, but whatever.

362
00:29:45,415 --> 00:29:45,896
[SPEAKER_07]: That's alright.

363
00:29:46,156 --> 00:29:46,496
[SPEAKER_07]: It's alright.

364
00:29:46,556 --> 00:29:47,857
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just, you know, let that guy have it.

365
00:29:47,877 --> 00:29:48,278
[SPEAKER_07]: It's cool.

366
00:29:50,059 --> 00:29:54,863
[SPEAKER_07]: And over the weekend, I actually got to take a little bit of a tour of the East Coast a little more.

367
00:29:54,923 --> 00:29:58,345
[SPEAKER_07]: My friend came and picked me up, and we drove through New York City a little bit.

368
00:29:58,365 --> 00:30:02,288
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't really stop to play DDR anymore until we were on the way back.

369
00:30:03,109 --> 00:30:12,496
[SPEAKER_07]: And I knew that there was an In the Groove machine in Jersey, and I thought, well, you know, we talk about it a lot on the show, and we've said a lot of judgments about it, but none of us have actually played it.

370
00:30:12,536 --> 00:30:13,617
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm like, I better go play it

371
00:30:14,028 --> 00:30:21,092
[SPEAKER_07]: So therefore, I can give a fair review of the game and actually say, well, I've played it so that, you know, you can't say I'm just talking about my ass.

372
00:30:21,516 --> 00:30:23,918
[SPEAKER_07]: So I will tell you what I thought about that a little later.

373
00:30:23,998 --> 00:30:26,920
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was at this place called Eight on the Break.

374
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:27,520
[SPEAKER_07]: That was it.

375
00:30:27,961 --> 00:30:32,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Which I actually, for some reason, by the sound of it, made me think it was some kind of boardwalk place.

376
00:30:32,203 --> 00:30:34,905
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no idea why I thought that, because it's not even near an ocean at all.

377
00:30:35,386 --> 00:30:40,789
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was interesting because there was this street fair going on the day we went.

378
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:47,034
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was so random, because the girl I was with, my friend Amanda and I, had no idea where we were going.

379
00:30:47,074 --> 00:30:48,475
[SPEAKER_07]: We were just walking around trying to find this place.

380
00:30:48,875 --> 00:30:54,937
[SPEAKER_07]: and suddenly here I am, thousands of miles away on a Sunday in the middle of some street fair in little town America.

381
00:30:55,317 --> 00:30:56,178
[SPEAKER_07]: This is really odd.

382
00:30:56,478 --> 00:30:57,098
[SPEAKER_07]: Surreal for me.

383
00:30:57,858 --> 00:31:00,199
[SPEAKER_07]: But then we found the place and we went in and I was actually surprised.

384
00:31:00,219 --> 00:31:02,060
[SPEAKER_07]: There was quite a lot of Bomani at this place.

385
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:09,822
[SPEAKER_07]: Not only had they the groove, but they had a 2DX machine and a Parapara machine and DDR and just a lot of stuff.

386
00:31:10,082 --> 00:31:11,663
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was pretty impressed.

387
00:31:11,683 --> 00:31:13,644
[SPEAKER_07]: I was kind of surprised they had all that.

388
00:31:13,924 --> 00:31:17,605
[SPEAKER_07]: Granted, not all the machines were in tip-top shape, but you know, hey.

389
00:31:18,186 --> 00:31:23,828
[SPEAKER_07]: It actually ran on quarters, which always impresses me, because I don't like tokens that much, because I always leave with extra tokens.

390
00:31:24,108 --> 00:31:26,389
[SPEAKER_07]: And the machines actually took quarters, so that was good.

391
00:31:26,949 --> 00:31:28,829
[SPEAKER_07]: And there seemed to be some okay crowds.

392
00:31:28,869 --> 00:31:30,590
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't really talk to too many people.

393
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:31,870
[SPEAKER_07]: I was kind of just a loner.

394
00:31:32,731 --> 00:31:33,251
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's alright.

395
00:31:33,271 --> 00:31:35,412
[SPEAKER_07]: I wasn't there to make a show.

396
00:31:36,432 --> 00:31:38,032
[SPEAKER_07]: I just kind of went in, played a few games, and left.

397
00:31:38,273 --> 00:31:40,173
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was my weekend, pretty much.

398
00:31:40,533 --> 00:31:44,434
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've just kind of spent my time here since I got back home, just trying to catch up.

399
00:31:44,475 --> 00:31:45,675
[SPEAKER_07]: Because when you leave town for two weeks...

400
00:31:46,275 --> 00:31:47,096
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really hard to catch up.

401
00:31:47,377 --> 00:31:49,419
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to go back to work tomorrow, though.

402
00:31:49,459 --> 00:31:50,280
[SPEAKER_07]: It sucks.

403
00:31:51,101 --> 00:31:56,087
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, that's pretty much it for me for How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day?

404
00:31:57,529 --> 00:32:03,937
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything else anybody wants to add?

405
00:32:04,337 --> 00:32:05,559
[SPEAKER_04]: I watched Rad today.

406
00:32:06,286 --> 00:32:13,690
[SPEAKER_04]: And might I add, I've, like, I only remembered, like, one scene of that movie, and that's what got me the bite, is where the guy was riding on the fence.

407
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:16,871
[SPEAKER_04]: And I actually watched the movie today, and that was for, like, half a second.

408
00:32:17,511 --> 00:32:23,574
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but for some reason in my mind that stood out, that and the backflip in the, um, hell, hell race.

409
00:32:23,654 --> 00:32:28,957
[SPEAKER_04]: But, my God, that movie is so cheesy and awesome, and just, it's awesome.

410
00:32:29,397 --> 00:32:32,379
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just pure 80s goodness, and I watched the whole thing.

411
00:32:32,619 --> 00:32:33,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Made me happy.

412
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:35,480
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead.

413
00:32:36,664 --> 00:32:40,066
[SPEAKER_17]: I last saw that movie in, huh?

414
00:32:41,527 --> 00:32:42,387
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, I would like to.

415
00:32:43,048 --> 00:32:48,531
[SPEAKER_17]: I last saw that in Albany, Georgia when I was 10, I think.

416
00:32:49,892 --> 00:32:53,554
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the last time I've seen that movie and it's very scary that I remember where I was.

417
00:32:55,735 --> 00:32:57,276
[SPEAKER_17]: I need to see Monster Squad 2.

418
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:00,838
[SPEAKER_17]: I was at my Uncle Wayne's house.

419
00:33:02,375 --> 00:33:18,356
[SPEAKER_17]: with my cousins and we were watching this movie and then it was over and we watched it again because at the time that was like our favorite movie and my cousin had one of those stunt bikes and was in his backyard trying to do all the stunts and everything it was kind of kind of cool

420
00:33:20,579 --> 00:33:24,721
[SPEAKER_07]: I got asked a question in the chatroom, www.orangelandrea.com, click on chat.

421
00:33:24,821 --> 00:33:31,324
[SPEAKER_07]: Sid wanted to know how Jay and Silent Bob's Secret Stash was, because I completely forgot to mention that was one other thing we did while we were in Jersey.

422
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:35,986
[SPEAKER_07]: We went to Red Bank, New Jersey to go to Jay and Silent Bob's Secret Stash, which was very cool.

423
00:33:36,306 --> 00:33:42,129
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just your typical kind of comic book store, but it had a lot of memorabilia from the movies, which I thought was really cool.

424
00:33:42,449 --> 00:33:44,049
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually bought Loki's birthday present there.

425
00:33:44,069 --> 00:33:45,090
[SPEAKER_07]: I bought him a comic book.

426
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:47,631
[SPEAKER_07]: And I got him a shirt.

427
00:33:47,971 --> 00:33:49,191
[SPEAKER_07]: And the shirt says shit on it.

428
00:33:49,451 --> 00:33:50,271
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's kind of cool.

429
00:33:50,811 --> 00:33:53,212
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I picked up some stickers and stuff too.

430
00:33:53,252 --> 00:33:55,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I got Jamie a Bear is Driving sticker.

431
00:33:55,272 --> 00:33:55,772
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's cool.

432
00:33:56,412 --> 00:33:58,393
[SPEAKER_07]: And I picked myself up a sticker.

433
00:33:58,533 --> 00:33:59,413
[SPEAKER_07]: And I got a poster.

434
00:33:59,513 --> 00:34:00,333
[SPEAKER_07]: A brand new poster.

435
00:34:00,373 --> 00:34:02,314
[SPEAKER_07]: Which we're going to hang up at some point tonight.

436
00:34:02,894 --> 00:34:04,774
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be on the wall that you can see on the camera.

437
00:34:05,074 --> 00:34:07,295
[SPEAKER_07]: I got a new poster from Jay and Silent Bob's Secret Stash.

438
00:34:07,595 --> 00:34:11,216
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's the one where Jay and Silent Bob has a whole little monologue on it.

439
00:34:11,256 --> 00:34:13,076
[SPEAKER_07]: Where Jay and Silent Bob are talking on the...

440
00:34:13,696 --> 00:34:15,998
[SPEAKER_07]: Ain't It Cool News style site.

441
00:34:16,479 --> 00:34:19,402
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're talking about the movie and they say, you are the ones who are the ball lickers.

442
00:34:19,442 --> 00:34:20,623
[SPEAKER_07]: I have the posters.

443
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:21,083
[SPEAKER_07]: That's cool.

444
00:34:21,544 --> 00:34:22,685
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was good times.

445
00:34:22,825 --> 00:34:24,467
[SPEAKER_07]: It was kind of a fun little place to go.

446
00:34:24,607 --> 00:34:25,608
[SPEAKER_06]: So, hooray.

447
00:34:29,037 --> 00:34:40,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and Jason says I'm a mean man because at the Phoenix airport on the way home I actually stopped and got to see Jason, our webmaster, for like 10 minutes because I had a layover in Phoenix for like 30 minutes or so.

448
00:34:41,007 --> 00:34:42,388
[SPEAKER_07]: So I got to say hi to our webmaster.

449
00:34:42,408 --> 00:34:45,530
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was very nice of him to come out and see me on his break from work.

450
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:46,511
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you, Jason.

451
00:34:47,232 --> 00:34:49,794
[SPEAKER_07]: And your airport rocks.

452
00:34:49,874 --> 00:34:52,235
[SPEAKER_07]: The Phoenix airport is the best place to have a layover.

453
00:34:52,576 --> 00:34:52,796
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, good.

454
00:34:52,816 --> 00:34:53,036
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

455
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:54,898
[SPEAKER_17]: The shirt was on the webcam a couple of pictures ago.

456
00:34:55,078 --> 00:34:55,338
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

457
00:34:56,491 --> 00:34:56,811
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

458
00:34:57,872 --> 00:34:58,152
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

459
00:34:59,292 --> 00:35:02,833
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess we're going to go to a break, and then we're going to come back, and we want to definitely talk about DDR Extreme.

460
00:35:02,853 --> 00:35:04,374
[SPEAKER_07]: A whole lot we want to say about that.

461
00:35:04,414 --> 00:35:05,434
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll get your thoughts, too.

462
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:10,796
[SPEAKER_07]: On the Skype line, if you want to know how the Skype line works, you can actually talk to us, just like a phone call, but free.

463
00:35:11,757 --> 00:35:13,217
[SPEAKER_07]: www.orangelaunchradio.com.

464
00:35:13,257 --> 00:35:16,058
[SPEAKER_07]: Click on Interact With Us, and all the information is there.

465
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:16,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

466
00:35:17,339 --> 00:35:17,479
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

467
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:17,879
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

468
00:35:17,999 --> 00:35:18,139
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

469
00:35:18,259 --> 00:35:18,399
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

470
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:18,659
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

471
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:18,839
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

472
00:35:18,899 --> 00:35:19,019
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

473
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:19,160
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

474
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:19,440
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

475
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:20,820
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

476
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:21,240
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

477
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,401
[SPEAKER_17]: I missed you.

478
00:35:23,201 --> 00:35:23,801
[SPEAKER_07]: Aw, thank you.

479
00:35:24,301 --> 00:35:25,602
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, how was the show last week, Loki?

480
00:35:27,634 --> 00:35:29,274
[SPEAKER_04]: It was, uh, interesting.

481
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:32,215
[SPEAKER_04]: It was pretty bad.

482
00:35:32,875 --> 00:35:40,976
[SPEAKER_04]: We played a lot of music, and I played a lot more music from, um, the Bomani-style remix contest, which was supposed to be judging, like, three weeks ago.

483
00:35:41,677 --> 00:35:42,317
[SPEAKER_04]: And this isn't.

484
00:35:42,437 --> 00:35:43,417
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what's going on.

485
00:35:43,857 --> 00:35:45,537
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, um, what else did we do?

486
00:35:45,817 --> 00:35:48,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we tried a new game that failed horribly.

487
00:35:48,598 --> 00:35:52,218
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, um... Um... I don't know.

488
00:35:52,278 --> 00:35:53,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Some other shit happened.

489
00:35:53,439 --> 00:35:53,619
[SPEAKER_04]: It was...

490
00:35:56,536 --> 00:35:59,738
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we played the Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen CD and that was sad.

491
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:03,879
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, there's your summary of episode 112.

492
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:09,702
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, also, we definitely want to talk about this, the Akira Yamaoka contest.

493
00:36:10,342 --> 00:36:14,164
[SPEAKER_07]: We have an announcement we want to make about the Akira Yamaoka contest, and we'll do that when we get back from this break.

494
00:36:14,624 --> 00:36:15,665
[SPEAKER_07]: And for those of you that haven't heard yet...

495
00:36:16,345 --> 00:36:19,327
[SPEAKER_07]: We're giving away two signed Akira Yamaoka CDs.

496
00:36:19,687 --> 00:36:19,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

497
00:36:20,548 --> 00:36:22,409
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have the details when we come back from this break.

498
00:36:22,469 --> 00:36:27,453
[SPEAKER_07]: In this break, Konami original music that's brand new in DDR EX USA.

499
00:36:27,513 --> 00:36:29,294
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to start it off with Maximizer.

500
00:36:29,314 --> 00:36:32,256
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of you guys haven't even heard that yet, I don't think, so we're going to play that for you guys.

501
00:36:32,777 --> 00:36:38,121
[SPEAKER_07]: Funk Boogie, we'll get in there too, and of course, You're Not Here, because Jamie insists that I play You're Not Here.

502
00:36:38,361 --> 00:36:38,921
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie demands it.

503
00:36:39,181 --> 00:36:41,963
[SPEAKER_07]: So here it is, Maximizer on Orange Lounge Radio.

504
00:36:41,983 --> 00:36:42,684
[SPEAKER_07]: Enjoy, we'll be back.

505
00:38:22,574 --> 00:38:24,198
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks for watching!

506
00:38:45,001 --> 00:38:46,323
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you for watching!

507
00:39:33,738 --> 00:39:34,389
Thanks for watching!

508
00:40:09,452 --> 00:40:12,273
We've got two forever, the plane grass blows and the wind is dancing

509
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:40,243
[SPEAKER_19]: It would be a much better fight with you, with me If you hadn't met me, I'd be fine on my own, baby Never felt so lonely when you came along

510
00:40:50,613 --> 00:40:52,334
Thank you for watching!

511
00:41:12,077 --> 00:41:13,218
And who has time for tears?

512
00:41:13,238 --> 00:41:15,420
Never thought I'd sit around and unravel your love

513
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:43,266
[SPEAKER_07]: After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move Marathon.

514
00:41:43,546 --> 00:41:45,690
[SPEAKER_19]: No!

515
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:46,491
[SPEAKER_07]: Just kidding.

516
00:41:46,932 --> 00:41:47,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Orange Lounge Radio.

517
00:41:48,054 --> 00:41:49,657
[SPEAKER_07]: Crap-free Bavani Radio.

518
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:52,001
[SPEAKER_07]: We are back.

519
00:41:52,915 --> 00:42:01,260
[SPEAKER_07]: Not only crap free, but playing probably the only internet radio station on the planet to be playing Maximizer and all that fun stuff at this time.

520
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,481
[SPEAKER_07]: So, hope you enjoyed that.

521
00:42:03,641 --> 00:42:07,583
[SPEAKER_07]: And it looks like some of you guys maybe missed that, so we'll have to play that after the show is over.

522
00:42:08,323 --> 00:42:09,764
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely for you guys.

523
00:42:09,884 --> 00:42:14,847
[SPEAKER_07]: So, of course, Maximizer being from DDR Extreme USA, which was the big news this week.

524
00:42:15,327 --> 00:42:19,950
[SPEAKER_07]: Some very interesting opinions on that game, just kind of all across the spectrum.

525
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:21,891
[SPEAKER_07]: People love it, people hate it.

526
00:42:22,723 --> 00:42:27,784
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll open it up for some of your opinions as well, but first, what we think of DDR Extreme USA.

527
00:42:27,864 --> 00:42:34,046
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I know some of us have played it a lot, some of us have barely seen it at all, but kind of, what did you guys think of it?

528
00:42:34,326 --> 00:42:37,727
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll start off with Loki, he had the most exposure to the game, I'm kind of curious.

529
00:42:38,127 --> 00:42:38,907
[SPEAKER_07]: What did you think of it, Loki?

530
00:42:40,568 --> 00:42:45,309
[SPEAKER_04]: They had, okay, um, decent songs, um...

531
00:42:46,431 --> 00:42:48,832
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing I hate is unlocking old shit.

532
00:42:49,012 --> 00:42:51,193
[SPEAKER_04]: I honestly hate unlocking old shit.

533
00:42:51,213 --> 00:42:52,934
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, ooh, Trip Machine!

534
00:42:53,294 --> 00:42:54,715
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never played that one!

535
00:42:55,215 --> 00:42:56,816
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's just stuff like that.

536
00:42:57,256 --> 00:43:02,098
[SPEAKER_04]: But the things that really lacked in this game, the enosisms, they were just not funny.

537
00:43:02,318 --> 00:43:04,199
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, some songs just did not have them.

538
00:43:05,079 --> 00:43:05,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Very sad.

539
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:09,101
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Karaoke Revolution cover songs...

540
00:43:09,679 --> 00:43:12,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Bizarre Love Triangle, that was the only one I liked.

541
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:13,360
[SPEAKER_04]: The rest sucked.

542
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,361
[SPEAKER_04]: The singing was just awful and just crap.

543
00:43:16,481 --> 00:43:18,221
[SPEAKER_04]: And the steps weren't, eh, they're okay.

544
00:43:18,782 --> 00:43:21,822
[SPEAKER_04]: The new Konami Originals, Funk Boogie, pretty cool.

545
00:43:22,123 --> 00:43:27,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Maximizer, not exactly what I was imagining, but eh, it's okay.

546
00:43:27,724 --> 00:43:30,365
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, I don't know how to describe it.

547
00:43:30,665 --> 00:43:32,105
[SPEAKER_04]: It's annoying, but addicting.

548
00:43:32,706 --> 00:43:34,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Or like, you know, I don't know.

549
00:43:34,826 --> 00:43:37,687
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, I hate that type of music, but it's a pretty cool song.

550
00:43:38,306 --> 00:43:38,686
[SPEAKER_04]: or something.

551
00:43:39,307 --> 00:43:47,891
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, um, you know, the two transplants, uh, Your Rage, I, um, or Your Rain, the Rage mix, I don't like that song anymore.

552
00:43:48,431 --> 00:43:49,071
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just annoying.

553
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:52,513
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, and You're Not Here, that's a pretty cool song.

554
00:43:52,773 --> 00:43:53,713
[SPEAKER_04]: The steps so suck.

555
00:43:53,733 --> 00:43:54,374
[SPEAKER_04]: They're all up.

556
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:56,054
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just all up.

557
00:43:56,995 --> 00:44:05,799
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, um, now the best thing going for it, and I really don't understand why I didn't have this, um, to start off with, why the fuck do you have to unlock mission mode?

558
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:12,242
[SPEAKER_04]: My god, it was the coolest part of the game, and you have to unlock it, like, after a very long time to finally get mission mode.

559
00:44:13,142 --> 00:44:16,363
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was really stupid, because that's the best part of the game right there.

560
00:44:16,763 --> 00:44:18,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Then, okay, let's talk about the eye toy.

561
00:44:19,123 --> 00:44:21,324
[SPEAKER_04]: The eye toy games are, eh, they're okay.

562
00:44:21,524 --> 00:44:26,706
[SPEAKER_04]: The things that I don't like, okay, the hands and feet mode, actually, if you have a well-lit room, it works pretty well.

563
00:44:27,066 --> 00:44:28,426
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem is, it's not hard.

564
00:44:28,946 --> 00:44:29,666
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just stupid.

565
00:44:29,826 --> 00:44:31,087
[SPEAKER_04]: It's easy and stupid.

566
00:44:32,007 --> 00:44:32,127
[SPEAKER_04]: And...

567
00:44:32,808 --> 00:44:38,451
[SPEAKER_04]: What they really could have used in this game is edit mode and where you can make your own hands and feet steps.

568
00:44:38,952 --> 00:44:39,852
[SPEAKER_04]: That would fucking rock.

569
00:44:40,072 --> 00:44:42,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you can do some crazy shit there and it would be a lot more fun.

570
00:44:44,195 --> 00:44:49,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Then the other thing, some of the other games like the Coconut Panic, that was kind of dumb.

571
00:44:49,618 --> 00:44:50,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Amusing, but dumb.

572
00:44:51,451 --> 00:44:53,993
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

573
00:45:17,438 --> 00:45:25,241
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other modes that they've got, I didn't really play any of the non-iToy party modes, but they're okay from what I've seen.

574
00:45:25,281 --> 00:45:27,901
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just kind of, I think it'd be more fun if you were drunk.

575
00:45:28,702 --> 00:45:32,703
[SPEAKER_04]: And other than that, Mission Mode, I had a lot going for it.

576
00:45:32,723 --> 00:45:34,484
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of good stuff in Mission Mode.

577
00:45:34,524 --> 00:45:35,624
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish it was longer.

578
00:45:37,404 --> 00:45:40,686
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish some of the songs, they had some newer songs.

579
00:45:41,366 --> 00:45:43,586
[SPEAKER_04]: The character unlocks, I really don't care anymore.

580
00:45:43,747 --> 00:45:45,087
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just kind of stupid.

581
00:45:46,525 --> 00:45:47,785
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty much it.

582
00:45:47,886 --> 00:45:48,586
[SPEAKER_04]: It was okay.

583
00:45:49,126 --> 00:45:54,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Mission mode will be the only thing that keeps my attention with this game.

584
00:45:54,548 --> 00:45:55,208
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the only thing.

585
00:45:55,608 --> 00:45:56,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Mission mode.

586
00:45:56,068 --> 00:45:59,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's actually the only thing that's challenging in this game.

587
00:45:59,810 --> 00:46:00,190
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

588
00:46:02,831 --> 00:46:03,891
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'm going to give you my thoughts.

589
00:46:04,191 --> 00:46:06,592
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the game a lot.

590
00:46:06,872 --> 00:46:08,032
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the game so much.

591
00:46:08,092 --> 00:46:09,473
[SPEAKER_07]: It's probably my favorite...

592
00:46:10,855 --> 00:46:11,895
[SPEAKER_07]: It's up there with Ultramix.

593
00:46:11,955 --> 00:46:14,737
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd say this and Ultramix are kind of like my two favorite home mixes right now.

594
00:46:15,618 --> 00:46:17,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, I think it's very cool.

595
00:46:18,139 --> 00:46:20,200
[SPEAKER_07]: I really like some of the new stuff they put in it.

596
00:46:20,761 --> 00:46:23,823
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there's two big mistakes here, though, that they made.

597
00:46:24,103 --> 00:46:26,564
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to get this off my chest.

598
00:46:26,644 --> 00:46:28,386
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody's saying this.

599
00:46:29,186 --> 00:46:36,911
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously, it's a game-crippling mistake that they made with the game, and that was the removal of the dance play setting, where you can't turn off the buttons on the pads.

600
00:46:37,922 --> 00:46:40,065
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

601
00:46:57,849 --> 00:47:07,357
[SPEAKER_07]: and considering that the whole thing is based on trying to get up there and dance and move, I realize for a lot of beginner people, they're probably not going to have that problem.

602
00:47:07,637 --> 00:47:08,238
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, you know what?

603
00:47:08,298 --> 00:47:23,490
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I take that back because I was having some friends play it last night, some beginner friends, and they would try to be picking a song and they'd be stepping on my pad, which is a $100 red octane ignition pad, and they're fucking backing out because they're stepping on the wrong steps on the bottom.

604
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:24,991
[SPEAKER_07]: They're trying to step off the arrows.

605
00:47:25,766 --> 00:47:31,115
[SPEAKER_07]: And, I just, it was, it's just a horrible oversight.

606
00:47:31,155 --> 00:47:36,965
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, seriously, I know this sounds insane, but they should fucking recall the game and give us new copies.

607
00:47:37,025 --> 00:47:39,249
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, that's how bad of a mistake I seriously think this is.

608
00:47:40,990 --> 00:47:44,551
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, in the bright side, well, okay, no, let's keep raining down the bad stuff.

609
00:47:44,851 --> 00:47:46,192
[SPEAKER_07]: What else bad did I want to say about it?

610
00:47:46,472 --> 00:47:49,073
[SPEAKER_07]: I also do not like the fact that they unlock old songs.

611
00:47:49,513 --> 00:47:54,555
[SPEAKER_07]: I really just hate the repeat songs, and you shouldn't unlock old stuff.

612
00:47:54,695 --> 00:47:56,256
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's really bothersome.

613
00:47:56,756 --> 00:47:59,877
[SPEAKER_04]: But it would be cool, like, if, say...

614
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:05,861
[SPEAKER_04]: They had an included dropout in every fucking game since in the US mixes, pretty much.

615
00:48:06,301 --> 00:48:14,304
[SPEAKER_04]: If they had, like, I don't know, like a song, like, say, for instance, I'm in DDR 10th Mix or whatever it is, and look, there's a song from First Mix.

616
00:48:14,604 --> 00:48:16,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, I haven't played that since First Mix.

617
00:48:16,945 --> 00:48:18,166
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a long time ago.

618
00:48:18,506 --> 00:48:21,427
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty cool that they're unlocking old stuff for me to play.

619
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:24,108
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the only situation where that'd be good.

620
00:48:24,408 --> 00:48:25,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Not, oh, look at that.

621
00:48:25,829 --> 00:48:27,949
[SPEAKER_04]: That was just in that other game I bought.

622
00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:29,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.

623
00:48:30,664 --> 00:48:31,084
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

624
00:48:31,665 --> 00:48:31,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

625
00:48:33,826 --> 00:48:36,328
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, here's the other mistake I think they made.

626
00:48:36,368 --> 00:48:41,772
[SPEAKER_07]: And this may be kind of... This may be kind of a little bit controversial.

627
00:48:41,812 --> 00:48:42,112
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

628
00:48:42,672 --> 00:48:46,695
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think the other mistake that they made with this game was calling it DDR Extreme.

629
00:48:47,196 --> 00:48:56,202
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I seriously think that's why you've got so many people that have their expectations on one level when the product that Konami was trying to deliver was something...

630
00:48:57,014 --> 00:48:57,554
[SPEAKER_07]: and many more.

631
00:49:23,675 --> 00:49:25,876
[SPEAKER_07]: Beginner stuff, getting some friends into it, and it was fun.

632
00:49:25,936 --> 00:49:26,976
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's what it's all about.

633
00:49:27,476 --> 00:49:31,877
[SPEAKER_07]: Those modes weren't for hardcore players to be challenged, I don't think.

634
00:49:31,918 --> 00:49:34,658
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just stupid fun stuff, and I think it succeeded.

635
00:49:34,838 --> 00:49:36,099
[SPEAKER_07]: I really like the eye toy stuff.

636
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:37,479
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have a problem with it at all.

637
00:49:37,799 --> 00:49:39,040
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of hope they keep it going.

638
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:42,701
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to see hands and feet mode get a little more challenging in the next mid.

639
00:49:43,041 --> 00:49:44,461
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's something they could expand on.

640
00:49:44,961 --> 00:49:50,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Another thing that they didn't include that really needs to be included, sensitivity settings and adjustments for the eye toy.

641
00:49:50,423 --> 00:49:53,444
[SPEAKER_04]: How the fuck, if I'm in a dim room, I can't set it to dim room mode

642
00:49:53,891 --> 00:49:59,895
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like you can with iToyPlay or iToyGroove, they don't have any options to set the iToy stuff.

643
00:50:00,015 --> 00:50:02,376
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can't calibrate it to make it look nice.

644
00:50:02,937 --> 00:50:04,878
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're fucked if you're in a dark room.

645
00:50:04,998 --> 00:50:07,840
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't set it to be more sensitive.

646
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:09,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Or non-sensitive.

647
00:50:09,521 --> 00:50:10,902
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's too sensitive, then you're fucked.

648
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:13,043
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the other thing that really sucked.

649
00:50:15,231 --> 00:50:22,575
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they should have just, honestly, knowing what we know now about the next Japanese release and seeing as pretty much Konami of Japan made most of this release anyway.

650
00:50:22,595 --> 00:50:25,197
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't really blame the US for what's going on on this release.

651
00:50:26,417 --> 00:50:30,279
[SPEAKER_07]: The dance play setting thing, I'm almost positive it's Konami of Japan's fault.

652
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:31,140
[SPEAKER_07]: We all know the story.

653
00:50:33,231 --> 00:50:38,997
[SPEAKER_07]: We all know the story about the Marvelous Thing and how that was fought by Konami of America to Konami of Japan.

654
00:50:39,217 --> 00:50:41,640
[SPEAKER_07]: And Konami of Japan said, no, they're not changing the Marvelous Thing.

655
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:45,804
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would bet money the exact same thing happened with the dance play setting.

656
00:50:46,825 --> 00:50:49,448
[SPEAKER_07]: Shame on you, Konami of Japan, for being lazy with that.

657
00:50:49,848 --> 00:50:52,711
[SPEAKER_07]: You really upset a lot of us with that, so shame on you for that.

658
00:50:52,751 --> 00:50:53,532
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no way...

659
00:50:54,341 --> 00:50:57,427
[SPEAKER_07]: I really want to purchase DDR Festival knowing that.

660
00:50:57,507 --> 00:51:01,755
[SPEAKER_07]: And especially because, you know, what we'll talk about later, but Festival doesn't really have that great a song list so far.

661
00:51:02,055 --> 00:51:05,581
[SPEAKER_07]: But if that dance play setting isn't going to be in Festival, there's no reason I need to buy it, honestly.

662
00:51:05,621 --> 00:51:06,303
[SPEAKER_07]: There's zero.

663
00:51:07,325 --> 00:51:07,505
[SPEAKER_09]: But...

664
00:51:10,546 --> 00:51:16,930
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess really knowing what we know now about DDR Festival, the next Japanese release, they probably should have just called this mix DDR Festival.

665
00:51:17,511 --> 00:51:19,672
[SPEAKER_07]: The US one, they should have just called this mix DDR Festival.

666
00:51:19,712 --> 00:51:25,016
[SPEAKER_06]: And then people wouldn't have gone in with all these expectations like, Oh, Cartoon Heroes has to be in it, and Sakura has to be in it.

667
00:51:25,036 --> 00:51:25,696
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no, no, no.

668
00:51:26,016 --> 00:51:30,379
[SPEAKER_07]: Because honestly, Konami was doing something different with this mix, and I think it was cool.

669
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:33,442
[SPEAKER_07]: I, for one, like the new interface.

670
00:51:33,742 --> 00:51:34,242
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot.

671
00:51:34,722 --> 00:51:35,323
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not...

672
00:51:36,013 --> 00:51:40,595
[SPEAKER_07]: The circle thing that was bugging everybody, that people were talking about, like, oh, it looks like third mix and stuff.

673
00:51:40,615 --> 00:51:42,096
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not what I'm talking about, really.

674
00:51:42,496 --> 00:51:50,900
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just one part of it, but really, the rest of the music in the game, and the way it looks in-game when you're actually playing the game is amazing.

675
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:53,441
[SPEAKER_07]: It's way better than, like, any other DDR game.

676
00:51:53,501 --> 00:51:54,141
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks in-game.

677
00:51:54,181 --> 00:51:59,723
[SPEAKER_07]: It takes everything that's great about fourth mix, everything that's great about max, the 60 frames per second and stuff, and combines it.

678
00:52:00,624 --> 00:52:05,486
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the interface is the best one they've had yet, with the Oni battery bar and everything looks great.

679
00:52:06,232 --> 00:52:06,732
[SPEAKER_07]: So what?

680
00:52:06,813 --> 00:52:08,154
[SPEAKER_07]: The wheel looks a little different.

681
00:52:08,354 --> 00:52:09,435
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't really bother me at all.

682
00:52:09,535 --> 00:52:11,596
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the wheel better than... You see it for like two seconds.

683
00:52:11,817 --> 00:52:20,644
[SPEAKER_17]: I like the wheel better than the other way, because you... I don't know, it just... Having started with Second Mix, I think that it makes me think a lot more of the older ones, so I like it better.

684
00:52:23,646 --> 00:52:23,806
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

685
00:52:26,078 --> 00:52:29,660
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the little records would have been cool, but, you know, I don't really care.

686
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:31,400
[SPEAKER_07]: The interface really doesn't bother me.

687
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,181
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not something that, like, ruined the game for me.

688
00:52:33,201 --> 00:52:34,302
[SPEAKER_07]: It didn't really faze me at all.

689
00:52:34,342 --> 00:52:35,822
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of thought, oh, that's different.

690
00:52:36,142 --> 00:52:50,789
[SPEAKER_07]: But I can see where people who have been kind of stuck on DDR Extreme for several years now, who have really badly, because they can't afford a Japanese PlayStation 2, have wanted something like that for a console for a long time, are a little bit disappointed.

691
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:53,101
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what?

692
00:52:53,261 --> 00:52:54,821
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a new song.

693
00:52:55,402 --> 00:52:56,882
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, I know, I know.

694
00:52:58,223 --> 00:53:15,509
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, from that standpoint, if Konami knows damn well there's not going to be any new arcade mixes, which from Konami Japan, it doesn't sound like they're ever planning on really doing one, it would have not been smart to release just a port of DDR Extreme, because then why would you go to the arcades?

695
00:53:16,294 --> 00:53:36,868
[SPEAKER_07]: so I think them making it a lot different was probably smart on their end in the end because you'll still go to the arcades to play Sakura and all that stuff so I don't know just kind of my thought I know but come on come on they know damn well it's here they know damn well extreme is here

696
00:53:38,034 --> 00:53:55,510
[SPEAKER_07]: Haven't we had this talk on the show with somebody from Konami here, and they said that they know it's just one of those things where it's like, and I always said this, nobody has confirmed this, but this has always been my opinion on this, is that it has to do with the music licensing, and that it's way easier to get the music license in Japan.

697
00:53:56,010 --> 00:54:04,758
[SPEAKER_07]: So if they put that disclaimer on there that says, don't use this outside Japan, and then, oh, well, gee, imagine that, the machines ended up in the U.S., gee, fancy that, how did that happen?

698
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:10,563
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't have to go and get sued by the record companies because they have the disclaimer on there.

699
00:54:10,583 --> 00:54:11,624
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the arcade owner's fault.

700
00:54:11,664 --> 00:54:13,065
[SPEAKER_07]: The game's in there when it's not supposed to be.

701
00:54:13,405 --> 00:54:15,926
[SPEAKER_07]: But at the same time, they got all the great music for DDR.

702
00:54:16,026 --> 00:54:17,607
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

703
00:54:18,048 --> 00:54:18,648
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just my thought.

704
00:54:18,668 --> 00:54:24,071
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you didn't get to play it a whole lot, Jamie, but what did you think of Extreme?

705
00:54:24,091 --> 00:54:24,832
[SPEAKER_07]: Just kind of looking at it.

706
00:54:24,852 --> 00:54:25,272
[SPEAKER_16]: It's okay.

707
00:54:25,312 --> 00:54:28,154
[SPEAKER_16]: I like the non-stop music when you're picking the non-stop.

708
00:54:29,394 --> 00:54:30,455
[SPEAKER_16]: That music was just pretty cool.

709
00:54:32,656 --> 00:54:33,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the mini-music was really good.

710
00:54:35,111 --> 00:54:38,154
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the new mods that they're doing in this mission mode.

711
00:54:38,354 --> 00:54:39,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are really cool.

712
00:54:40,596 --> 00:54:43,479
[SPEAKER_04]: And also Air Japan's going to hack those out and put those in the normal game.

713
00:54:44,179 --> 00:54:45,160
[SPEAKER_14]: But feeding time?

714
00:54:45,921 --> 00:54:47,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Feeding time scared me.

715
00:54:49,164 --> 00:54:50,105
[SPEAKER_07]: So stupid.

716
00:54:52,627 --> 00:54:54,549
[SPEAKER_07]: Angel, I know you got to play a lot of Extreme this week.

717
00:54:54,569 --> 00:54:55,129
[SPEAKER_07]: What were your thoughts?

718
00:54:55,149 --> 00:54:59,013
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to open up the Skype line soon for your thoughts, but I want to get everybody in the studio first.

719
00:55:00,204 --> 00:55:06,168
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, well, I didn't get to play too much of it, considering I'd just gotten it... What day was it, release Tuesday?

720
00:55:06,649 --> 00:55:07,129
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, anyway.

721
00:55:07,790 --> 00:55:14,334
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, the thing that kind of got me down was, um, Unlocking Your Rain, like, the second song I played.

722
00:55:14,374 --> 00:55:15,355
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm like, no!

723
00:55:15,915 --> 00:55:18,057
[SPEAKER_13]: I wish that it was, you know, like, the last song.

724
00:55:18,617 --> 00:55:22,920
[SPEAKER_13]: Just because, like, that was the song I was really looking forward to, but... Isn't Your Rain in there by default?

725
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:24,501
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you just miss it the first game, maybe?

726
00:55:24,701 --> 00:55:25,702
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it was in there by default.

727
00:55:26,022 --> 00:55:27,183
[SPEAKER_13]: I might have, um...

728
00:55:28,487 --> 00:55:29,387
[SPEAKER_13]: But, I don't know.

729
00:55:30,608 --> 00:55:30,968
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

730
00:55:31,888 --> 00:55:34,589
[SPEAKER_13]: I just... Oh, okay.

731
00:55:34,669 --> 00:55:36,610
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, anyway.

732
00:55:37,030 --> 00:55:38,670
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that was kind of a downer.

733
00:55:38,730 --> 00:55:46,633
[SPEAKER_13]: I know there's other stuff that I probably have yet to unlock, like the BT song and the, oh, whatever, all the other songs that we've been playing today.

734
00:55:47,473 --> 00:55:48,193
[SPEAKER_13]: But, you know what?

735
00:55:48,333 --> 00:55:49,554
[SPEAKER_13]: That's for the week to come.

736
00:55:52,085 --> 00:56:00,511
[SPEAKER_04]: And how many games, how many games will it take before you make more steps for Max 2 Oni songs?

737
00:56:02,593 --> 00:56:04,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Or the Max 1 Oni songs, whatever song.

738
00:56:04,955 --> 00:56:07,336
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Max 2 Oni songs, come on now.

739
00:56:07,516 --> 00:56:10,519
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Zegaru Apple Mix, it's been out forever now.

740
00:56:10,659 --> 00:56:12,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Make some new fucking steps.

741
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:13,441
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't take that long.

742
00:56:13,841 --> 00:56:15,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, just make new steps.

743
00:56:15,703 --> 00:56:16,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Complete them.

744
00:56:16,755 --> 00:56:22,878
[SPEAKER_04]: They did it in the UK, you know, before the beatmix in Historia 2001.

745
00:56:23,138 --> 00:56:25,259
[SPEAKER_04]: They did it there because they like to be complete.

746
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:27,740
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, you know, we just have to be lazy.

747
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:32,062
[SPEAKER_04]: We're only going to have challenge steps because we don't want to make new steps.

748
00:56:32,502 --> 00:56:33,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

749
00:56:33,923 --> 00:56:35,404
[SPEAKER_04]: So get off your ass and make new steps.

750
00:56:38,985 --> 00:56:42,687
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, I think this mix will hold me over just fine until Ultramix 2 comes out.

751
00:56:43,663 --> 00:56:44,103
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know what?

752
00:56:44,143 --> 00:56:49,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously, the bar of expectations is just so high with Ultramix 2 right now with everything I've heard about it.

753
00:56:49,465 --> 00:56:55,328
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just kind of like I'm almost going to feel bad when it comes out because it's probably not going to... I don't know.

754
00:56:55,448 --> 00:56:55,808
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

755
00:56:56,408 --> 00:57:00,750
[SPEAKER_07]: My bar is so high for Ultramix 2 that that is really the one I'm waiting for at this point.

756
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:02,210
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, Extreme's cool and all, though.

757
00:57:02,230 --> 00:57:02,790
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't get me wrong.

758
00:57:03,291 --> 00:57:07,212
[SPEAKER_07]: I do recommend if you are a DDR fan and you have a PlayStation 2, you should have this game.

759
00:57:08,073 --> 00:57:08,893
[SPEAKER_07]: You should have this game.

760
00:57:09,233 --> 00:57:11,854
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have a Japanese PlayStation 2, then I guess you have a choice.

761
00:57:12,267 --> 00:57:15,669
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you have a US one, then you really should just get this game.

762
00:57:16,009 --> 00:57:18,271
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's DDR and it's good.

763
00:57:21,052 --> 00:57:21,172
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh.

764
00:57:22,193 --> 00:57:22,393
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

765
00:57:26,355 --> 00:57:27,096
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway.

766
00:57:27,216 --> 00:57:27,476
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

767
00:57:28,897 --> 00:57:29,217
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

768
00:57:30,158 --> 00:57:31,158
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll play more this week.

769
00:57:31,799 --> 00:57:33,800
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, unlock more crap.

770
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:35,681
[SPEAKER_13]: And maybe I'll like it more.

771
00:57:35,781 --> 00:57:38,442
[SPEAKER_13]: But right now, as soon as I saw you ran, I was like, no!

772
00:57:39,543 --> 00:57:41,024
[SPEAKER_13]: Big disappointment for me, but I'll keep playing.

773
00:57:42,139 --> 00:57:43,479
[SPEAKER_13]: Shane, don't hit me, please.

774
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:46,400
[SPEAKER_07]: Bradley, you're a DDR fan.

775
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:48,921
[SPEAKER_07]: You mentioned at the beginning of the show you were a little bit disappointed with the mix.

776
00:57:48,941 --> 00:57:50,022
[SPEAKER_07]: Just kind of curious on your thoughts.

777
00:57:50,242 --> 00:57:53,723
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, based on what I saw, I wasn't that impressed with it.

778
00:57:54,543 --> 00:57:55,203
[SPEAKER_11]: It wasn't bad.

779
00:57:55,283 --> 00:57:56,404
[SPEAKER_11]: It was just, nah.

780
00:57:56,544 --> 00:57:59,425
[SPEAKER_11]: It didn't make me excited or anything.

781
00:57:59,725 --> 00:58:07,467
[SPEAKER_11]: But I probably would, if I got to see Master Mode, or might have had, or whatever that is called.

782
00:58:07,527 --> 00:58:08,968
[SPEAKER_11]: Because we didn't unlock that while I was here.

783
00:58:09,188 --> 00:58:09,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, the Maximizer?

784
00:58:10,008 --> 00:58:10,088
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

785
00:58:10,683 --> 00:58:12,724
[SPEAKER_11]: No, not Maximizer, the Master Mode.

786
00:58:13,325 --> 00:58:14,105
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Mission Mode.

787
00:58:14,125 --> 00:58:14,545
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Mission Mode.

788
00:58:14,565 --> 00:58:14,946
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

789
00:58:14,966 --> 00:58:15,766
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

790
00:58:16,246 --> 00:58:20,289
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I like to do those kind of weird things in owning modes and things like that.

791
00:58:22,310 --> 00:58:24,911
[SPEAKER_11]: Instead of just straight up DDR when I'm playing with the home mixes.

792
00:58:25,272 --> 00:58:26,813
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that kind of reminds... I don't have them anymore.

793
00:58:26,833 --> 00:58:27,673
[SPEAKER_07]: That reminded me of something.

794
00:58:27,713 --> 00:58:34,617
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of people were really upset because there were no 10-foot steps for Maximizer because supposedly Maximizer is supposed to be this new... Well, okay, whatever.

795
00:58:34,657 --> 00:58:35,558
[SPEAKER_07]: They have the Mission Mode thing.

796
00:58:35,578 --> 00:58:36,458
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know what I'm talking about.

797
00:58:36,618 --> 00:58:38,039
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't have steps in-game.

798
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:39,200
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm kind of like...

799
00:58:39,975 --> 00:58:49,917
[SPEAKER_07]: Big deal, because for me, honestly, I don't get the desire to have all these insane 10-footers on home, because how in the hell are you going to pass that stuff on a home pad?

800
00:58:49,957 --> 00:58:58,858
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I realize people do it, but I've been playing DDR for years, and there's no way in hell I'd be passing half those 10-footers on a home pad.

801
00:58:58,898 --> 00:58:59,939
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, you just can't do it.

802
00:59:00,279 --> 00:59:01,619
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not the same as the arcade.

803
00:59:01,659 --> 00:59:06,460
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, granted, you may have a metal stage or whatever, but if that's the case, you are in the minority.

804
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:07,980
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's face it, you are not

805
00:59:08,655 --> 00:59:19,544
[SPEAKER_07]: The majority of, uh, you know, the people that are gonna be picking up DDR, you are the minority, and if, you know, Konami's gonna cater to you, you're, like, extra special if you get your ten-footer, so, you know, whatever.

806
00:59:19,644 --> 00:59:28,250
[SPEAKER_07]: I just, I just don't see the point in bitching about there not being a lot of new ten-footers, because, especially with the dance play setting not being fucked up.

807
00:59:28,350 --> 00:59:30,232
[SPEAKER_07]: How, now how are you gonna pass ten-footers?

808
00:59:30,592 --> 00:59:32,393
[SPEAKER_07]: Now the dance play setting's there, it's like, ugh.

809
00:59:33,134 --> 00:59:36,717
[SPEAKER_07]: Unless you're playing Button Button Revolution, but that's not what DDR's supposed to be for!

810
00:59:37,403 --> 00:59:39,805
[SPEAKER_07]: Then they wouldn't be getting their weight loss news stories and stuff.

811
00:59:39,865 --> 00:59:40,565
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, I'm done.

812
00:59:40,645 --> 00:59:40,925
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm done.

813
00:59:43,707 --> 00:59:44,127
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything else?

814
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:44,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody else?

815
00:59:44,648 --> 00:59:47,209
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

816
00:59:47,269 --> 00:59:50,452
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go to a break, and then I'm going to open up the Skype line, and we'll get your thoughts.

817
00:59:50,972 --> 00:59:55,175
[SPEAKER_07]: And speaking of DDR in the news, we want to get to that story, because DDR was in the news again this week.

818
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:57,256
[SPEAKER_07]: So, of course, you know we've got to mention that.

819
00:59:57,776 --> 01:00:02,820
[SPEAKER_07]: This break, we're going to do some of those Karaoke Revolution songs, because there's surprisingly some decent ones.

820
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:06,422
[SPEAKER_07]: I will not be playing Waiting for Tonight, though, because I fucking hate that one.

821
01:00:07,588 --> 01:00:10,650
[SPEAKER_07]: But we will play Bizarre Love Triangle and some other stuff.

822
01:00:10,790 --> 01:00:11,090
[SPEAKER_07]: Enjoy.

823
01:00:11,130 --> 01:00:11,630
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be back.

824
01:00:11,830 --> 01:00:15,412
[SPEAKER_07]: And with the Skype line, open up your thoughts on DDR Extreme.

825
01:00:15,472 --> 01:00:19,514
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you want to argue with us on some point, go for it.

826
01:01:24,101 --> 01:01:30,602
I love you, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

827
01:02:23,118 --> 01:02:35,565
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, yes, this lady's a knife, and the feeling's right Oh, yes, this lady's a knife, oh, what a knife Oh, baby, oh, baby Oh, baby, oh, baby Oh, baby, oh, baby Oh, baby, oh, baby

828
01:03:02,910 --> 01:03:27,370
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh yes, it's late at night, and I'm feeling light Oh yes, it's late at night, oh what a night Oh yes, it's late at night, and I'm feeling bright Oh yes, it's late at night, oh what a night Oh yes, it's late at night, and I'm feeling light Oh yes, it's late at night, oh what a night Oh yes, it's late at night, and I'm feeling bright Oh yes, it's late at night

829
01:03:58,195 --> 01:04:17,941
[SPEAKER_19]: There's no talking to you It's so sad that you're leaving It takes time to believe it But after all that's said and done You're gonna be the lonely one Oh, you'll be leaving like

830
01:04:43,655 --> 01:04:45,981
Thanks for watching!

831
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:29,448
[SPEAKER_33]: For up to the minute Pomanian gaming news, discussion forums, and for access to the chatroom, visit our website at orangeloungeradio.com We're back.

832
01:05:30,509 --> 01:05:35,953
[SPEAKER_07]: I forgot to even talk about the Karaoke Revolution songs in DDR Extreme, but playing those kind of reminded me of some of the reaction from the chatroom.

833
01:05:37,654 --> 01:05:39,976
[SPEAKER_07]: Karaoke Revolution songs, I thought I was going to love it.

834
01:05:40,356 --> 01:05:41,597
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it was going to be a great idea.

835
01:05:43,912 --> 01:05:47,302
[SPEAKER_07]: But to be honest, I'm not a big fan of any of the Karaoke Revolution transplants.

836
01:05:47,322 --> 01:05:50,332
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, maybe a couple are okay, but at the same time...

837
01:05:50,934 --> 01:06:02,361
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of applaud Konami for trying that because it was a pretty clever idea to get some big dance songs in DDR without having to pay such a high license fee is to put in the covers.

838
01:06:02,921 --> 01:06:04,882
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just that the covers aren't that hot.

839
01:06:05,223 --> 01:06:09,745
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think it's a neat idea and maybe they'll do it better next time.

840
01:06:09,865 --> 01:06:12,187
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, but I can't say I'm a huge fan of any of those songs.

841
01:06:12,207 --> 01:06:12,947
[SPEAKER_07]: That's me personally.

842
01:06:13,047 --> 01:06:15,168
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not really a huge fan of any of those.

843
01:06:19,309 --> 01:06:21,110
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't think the original Bizarre Love Triangle is good?

844
01:06:22,250 --> 01:06:24,251
[SPEAKER_17]: No, the original Bizarre Love Triangle was excellent.

845
01:06:24,291 --> 01:06:25,492
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm talking about the Cher song.

846
01:06:25,792 --> 01:06:26,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

847
01:06:26,952 --> 01:06:28,653
[SPEAKER_17]: Women's career was over a long time ago.

848
01:06:29,633 --> 01:06:29,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Gotcha.

849
01:06:30,253 --> 01:06:30,534
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

850
01:06:33,575 --> 01:06:41,478
[SPEAKER_07]: I forgot to bring up the... I'm glad the microphone didn't pick that up, Loki.

851
01:06:41,498 --> 01:06:41,618
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

852
01:06:42,555 --> 01:06:47,240
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not even gonna... I said, why can't she ski into a tree?

853
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:51,023
[SPEAKER_17]: If she had skied into the tree, she would have bounced off from all the plastic in her face.

854
01:06:51,164 --> 01:06:58,651
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway... On a different note, I want to talk about the Akira Yamaoka CD contest.

855
01:06:59,227 --> 01:06:59,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

856
01:07:28,949 --> 01:07:33,092
[SPEAKER_07]: After the show tonight, at some point, probably check for it tomorrow on our website, OrangeLandRadio.com.

857
01:07:33,493 --> 01:07:36,255
[SPEAKER_07]: We will be starting the contest next Monday.

858
01:07:36,295 --> 01:07:39,577
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to have to listen Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday night.

859
01:07:39,617 --> 01:07:48,383
[SPEAKER_07]: If you can't listen, get your friend to listen because we've got to be giving out some trivia questions that you're going to have to answer to correctly be put in the drawing to win one of those CDs.

860
01:07:48,423 --> 01:07:49,044
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't want to miss it.

861
01:07:50,012 --> 01:07:51,934
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to be starting that next Monday.

862
01:07:52,254 --> 01:07:57,659
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course a big thank you to one of our partner sites, DDRspot.com for helping us out with this contest.

863
01:07:57,739 --> 01:07:59,601
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're going to be giving away some CDs too.

864
01:07:59,901 --> 01:08:02,323
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you don't win with us, go try and win with them.

865
01:08:02,343 --> 01:08:03,945
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they're going to be doing their own contest.

866
01:08:03,985 --> 01:08:05,106
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what they're doing yet though.

867
01:08:05,126 --> 01:08:06,087
[SPEAKER_07]: They haven't even clued me in.

868
01:08:06,387 --> 01:08:06,907
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's alright.

869
01:08:07,688 --> 01:08:09,089
[SPEAKER_07]: So definitely check them out.

870
01:08:09,189 --> 01:08:10,811
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're going to be relaunching their site.

871
01:08:11,371 --> 01:08:12,712
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to give too much away though.

872
01:08:12,893 --> 01:08:13,793
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I already said too much.

873
01:08:14,949 --> 01:08:22,813
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, as promised, let's open up the Skype line and see what your thoughts are on DDR Extreme USA.

874
01:08:26,014 --> 01:08:29,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, I gotta wait, because there's the delay, so I probably should open it up a little sooner, but that's alright.

875
01:08:34,031 --> 01:08:35,232
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

876
01:09:05,978 --> 01:09:09,060
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, what are your thoughts, buddy, on DDR Extreme USA?

877
01:09:09,740 --> 01:09:14,023
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, DDR Extreme, so many complaints, so many complaints.

878
01:09:14,603 --> 01:09:18,946
[SPEAKER_09]: I still haven't played the game where all these complaints are directed towards, because I played a very decent game.

879
01:09:21,467 --> 01:09:24,689
[SPEAKER_07]: So you must have been playing some completely different game than everybody else, huh?

880
01:09:25,390 --> 01:09:25,890
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty much.

881
01:09:25,910 --> 01:09:28,491
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I fully enjoyed the song list.

882
01:09:29,031 --> 01:09:34,813
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, there are a few that I didn't like, but, I mean, out of 70 songs, you're going to have a few that you don't like.

883
01:09:34,913 --> 01:09:35,674
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree, I agree.

884
01:09:35,694 --> 01:09:40,855
[SPEAKER_07]: There's going to be that let them move, or in the case of DDR Max 2, Forever Sunshine.

885
01:09:41,016 --> 01:09:41,576
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, Sigurd.

886
01:09:42,236 --> 01:09:43,016
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, please.

887
01:09:43,096 --> 01:09:44,537
[SPEAKER_09]: Forever Sunshine was good.

888
01:09:44,937 --> 01:09:46,317
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, please, yourself.

889
01:09:46,718 --> 01:09:47,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, alright, to each his own.

890
01:09:48,453 --> 01:09:49,234
[SPEAKER_07]: Use their own.

891
01:09:49,414 --> 01:09:50,274
[SPEAKER_09]: Agree to disagree.

892
01:09:50,555 --> 01:09:54,978
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's just these one-line complaints saying, oh my god, I hate this game, go get Japanese Extreme.

893
01:09:54,998 --> 01:09:55,378
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the point?

894
01:09:55,398 --> 01:10:01,723
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically people saying this mix isn't Japanese enough.

895
01:10:13,070 --> 01:10:14,351
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not Japanese enough.

896
01:10:14,551 --> 01:10:15,732
[SPEAKER_09]: Ironic.

897
01:10:16,372 --> 01:10:20,094
[SPEAKER_07]: Ironic, considering this game was pretty much made by Konami of Japan.

898
01:10:20,535 --> 01:10:21,335
[SPEAKER_07]: We've pretty much found out.

899
01:10:21,355 --> 01:10:24,777
[SPEAKER_17]: If you don't think it's Japanese enough, just play the stupid feeding frenzy mode.

900
01:10:26,621 --> 01:10:30,022
[SPEAKER_07]: The last four American mixes you own DDR Festivals?

901
01:10:50,652 --> 01:10:51,353
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty much.

902
01:10:51,433 --> 01:10:52,514
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, of course, we don't know.

903
01:10:52,794 --> 01:10:57,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, there could be something unlocked, or there might be some cool features they haven't talked about yet, but... 22 Dunk.

904
01:10:57,598 --> 01:10:59,039
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm betting on 22 Dunk.

905
01:10:59,199 --> 01:11:01,701
[SPEAKER_07]: Assumably, it's all the same.

906
01:11:02,742 --> 01:11:07,906
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gonna be totally like Max 1, the Japanese one, with the whole two unlocks.

907
01:11:08,347 --> 01:11:08,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Woo!

908
01:11:08,927 --> 01:11:09,788
[SPEAKER_04]: Two unlocks!

909
01:11:09,928 --> 01:11:10,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god!

910
01:11:10,889 --> 01:11:12,130
[SPEAKER_04]: There's gotta be more, right?

911
01:11:12,270 --> 01:11:13,911
[SPEAKER_04]: If I play like 500 times, there'll be more?

912
01:11:13,931 --> 01:11:14,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

913
01:11:14,532 --> 01:11:14,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

914
01:11:16,894 --> 01:11:18,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Or was that Max 2 with 3 unlocks?

915
01:11:18,995 --> 01:11:20,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, will there be 4?

916
01:11:20,496 --> 01:11:22,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh wait, no, I thought it was Party Collection.

917
01:11:22,458 --> 01:11:26,640
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna guess that there's gonna be 5 unlocks in this next game.

918
01:11:26,660 --> 01:11:27,201
[SPEAKER_04]: 5 unlocks.

919
01:11:27,581 --> 01:11:27,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Brand new.

920
01:11:29,542 --> 01:11:30,063
[SPEAKER_07]: So noted.

921
01:11:30,323 --> 01:11:33,545
[SPEAKER_07]: What was your favorite thing about Extreme USA, Mr. Mullet?

922
01:11:33,565 --> 01:11:34,185
[SPEAKER_09]: My favorite thing?

923
01:11:34,546 --> 01:11:35,726
[SPEAKER_09]: Easily the mission mode.

924
01:11:36,167 --> 01:11:45,032
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I didn't think there was gonna be that many missions, and I didn't get a chance to play the game until Thursday, so I had to wade through about a billion complaints on the Freak Forums.

925
01:11:45,273 --> 01:11:45,793
[SPEAKER_20]: Ha ha ha.

926
01:11:46,468 --> 01:11:52,111
[SPEAKER_09]: But as soon as I heard someone say something about Mission 75 I was like, hold on, back up the car, 75?

927
01:11:52,611 --> 01:12:03,477
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I know, there's a lot of missions in there I think even here in studio we're only through like Mission 53 We just haven't had enough time to play through all the missions Have you checked out Mission 38 yet?

928
01:12:03,937 --> 01:12:12,141
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the one with Absolute It was Absolute and it was all these different speeds Oh, that was fun

929
01:12:13,154 --> 01:12:16,755
[SPEAKER_09]: But then again, wait till you get, there's one in the second half with Firefly Heavy.

930
01:12:17,255 --> 01:12:17,795
[SPEAKER_09]: Same deal.

931
01:12:18,496 --> 01:12:19,156
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, jeez.

932
01:12:19,176 --> 01:12:34,700
[SPEAKER_09]: Speeds up, slows down, and apparently near the very end, like 98 or 99, there's the official fucked up Frozen Ray mission where it's reverse scroll, dark, arrows mixed up with random speed changes.

933
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:35,921
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my gosh.

934
01:12:36,401 --> 01:12:37,761
[SPEAKER_09]: What mission number is that?

935
01:12:38,241 --> 01:12:38,881
[SPEAKER_09]: It's either 98 or 90.

936
01:12:38,941 --> 01:12:39,782
[SPEAKER_09]: It's in the last five.

937
01:12:39,802 --> 01:12:40,682
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god.

938
01:12:42,697 --> 01:12:46,798
[SPEAKER_07]: I did the one, there was a Frozen Ray one, and I had to turn the controller upside down to do it.

939
01:12:47,219 --> 01:12:49,540
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it was on, it was like 49 or something.

940
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:50,720
[SPEAKER_09]: Mission 50.

941
01:12:51,761 --> 01:12:52,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Mission 50.

942
01:12:53,802 --> 01:13:03,006
[SPEAKER_09]: It took me over 50 tries for that one, and I did it with my pad right side up, and I managed to, I had to memorize the first part without looking at the screen.

943
01:13:03,026 --> 01:13:05,727
[SPEAKER_09]: I could do this mission now without looking at the screen.

944
01:13:07,325 --> 01:13:17,574
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll tell you, the one that stuck me for the longest time, and I can't believe this one took me as long as it did, but it's Your Rain on .5 and Dark.

945
01:13:18,234 --> 01:13:20,917
[SPEAKER_07]: And I swear to God, we had to do it like 40 times to beat it.

946
01:13:21,437 --> 01:13:22,598
[SPEAKER_04]: That didn't take me that long.

947
01:13:22,858 --> 01:13:27,502
[SPEAKER_04]: Did we ever get the one done where you have to, it was kick the can, where you had to get 20 of each?

948
01:13:28,123 --> 01:13:29,064
[SPEAKER_04]: 20 goods, 20 greats, 20 perfects?

949
01:13:29,084 --> 01:13:29,124
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

950
01:13:31,158 --> 01:13:32,358
[SPEAKER_07]: We're still stuck on that one.

951
01:13:32,398 --> 01:13:34,019
[SPEAKER_07]: That's like in the easy bunch.

952
01:13:34,099 --> 01:13:34,879
[SPEAKER_07]: We're still stuck on it.

953
01:13:34,919 --> 01:13:35,539
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't do it.

954
01:13:35,619 --> 01:13:37,520
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's too hard to get goods for us.

955
01:13:37,620 --> 01:13:40,781
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah, like, oh, the 20 great, good, perfect ones.

956
01:13:41,361 --> 01:13:42,521
[SPEAKER_09]: I managed to pass that.

957
01:13:42,921 --> 01:13:43,821
[SPEAKER_09]: It took me a while, too.

958
01:13:44,862 --> 01:13:50,503
[SPEAKER_09]: But, I mean, there's like some of them that were apparently very hard and that I couldn't pass.

959
01:13:51,844 --> 01:13:52,884
[SPEAKER_09]: Or, like, I could pass.

960
01:13:53,064 --> 01:13:54,224
[SPEAKER_09]: That was, like, really surprising.

961
01:13:54,244 --> 01:13:56,325
[SPEAKER_09]: There's apparently some easy ones that took me forever.

962
01:13:56,585 --> 01:13:59,246
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess it all depends on what you can do and what you can't.

963
01:14:00,286 --> 01:14:00,466
[SPEAKER_19]: Hmm.

964
01:14:01,178 --> 01:14:10,306
[SPEAKER_09]: Why don't you plug your site again, because you have this really nifty column over on that site, and people should go look at it.

965
01:14:26,138 --> 01:14:29,601
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yes, www.insidepulse.com.

966
01:14:29,841 --> 01:14:37,647
[SPEAKER_09]: Expect a DDR Extreme review that actually praises the game for what it has rather than what it doesn't have within reason.

967
01:14:38,982 --> 01:14:44,706
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, I don't bash the game because it doesn't have Sakura, for example.

968
01:14:45,087 --> 01:14:48,869
[SPEAKER_09]: But I will point out some of the fatal flaws, as it were.

969
01:14:48,950 --> 01:14:57,836
[SPEAKER_09]: But I mean, to be totally honest, this game has enough material in it to make this the greatest home version ever.

970
01:14:57,956 --> 01:15:00,218
[SPEAKER_07]: Until next month when we get Ultramix 2.

971
01:15:00,598 --> 01:15:01,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Or November, really.

972
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:04,461
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm telling you, I'm telling you.

973
01:15:05,282 --> 01:15:06,783
[SPEAKER_07]: Based on the hype alone...

974
01:15:07,549 --> 01:15:08,889
[SPEAKER_07]: Ultramix 2, all the way.

975
01:15:09,189 --> 01:15:09,549
[SPEAKER_07]: But we'll see.

976
01:15:09,589 --> 01:15:09,809
[SPEAKER_09]: That's true.

977
01:15:10,210 --> 01:15:12,850
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, anyway, I'll finish my thought if you don't mind.

978
01:15:12,990 --> 01:15:13,210
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

979
01:15:14,290 --> 01:15:28,253
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I said, it has enough material to make this the greatest home version ever, but it has enough, it has the critical dance pad error, which really didn't affect me that much, but it has that error and it has a few other errors to bring it right back down.

980
01:15:28,553 --> 01:15:30,874
[SPEAKER_09]: But the good far outweighs the bad, really.

981
01:15:30,894 --> 01:15:31,154
[SPEAKER_09]: Really.

982
01:15:31,893 --> 01:15:33,554
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree, the good outweighs the bad.

983
01:15:33,814 --> 01:15:36,675
[SPEAKER_07]: The dance pad thing is really annoying, but I'll get over it someday.

984
01:15:36,735 --> 01:15:37,576
[SPEAKER_07]: Somehow I'll survive.

985
01:15:37,596 --> 01:15:42,098
[SPEAKER_07]: When are you going to start writing for the wrestling portion of the site?

986
01:15:42,118 --> 01:15:43,018
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I'm curious about.

987
01:15:45,580 --> 01:15:46,980
[SPEAKER_07]: Had to ask, had to ask.

988
01:15:48,601 --> 01:15:49,422
[SPEAKER_07]: Get some wrasslin'.

989
01:15:49,762 --> 01:15:51,042
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you looking forward to Rumble Roses?

990
01:15:52,263 --> 01:15:54,744
[SPEAKER_07]: All the boys on that site must be looking forward to Rumble Roses.

991
01:15:54,864 --> 01:15:55,304
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on.

992
01:15:55,805 --> 01:15:58,566
[SPEAKER_07]: You got the Bomani artist, you got the wrasslin'.

993
01:15:59,383 --> 01:16:00,985
[SPEAKER_07]: Boobies, come on.

994
01:16:02,046 --> 01:16:05,129
[SPEAKER_09]: If I get that game, it'll be to hear Look to the Sky again.

995
01:16:05,489 --> 01:16:05,870
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

996
01:16:06,290 --> 01:16:06,751
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't care.

997
01:16:08,072 --> 01:16:09,954
[SPEAKER_07]: Look to the Sky and Boobies, right?

998
01:16:10,755 --> 01:16:11,516
[SPEAKER_09]: Look to the Boobies.

999
01:16:11,636 --> 01:16:12,837
[SPEAKER_07]: Look to the Boobies, exactly.

1000
01:16:12,857 --> 01:16:13,438
[SPEAKER_07]: That's Rumble Road.

1001
01:16:13,458 --> 01:16:14,639
[SPEAKER_07]: That should be it.

1002
01:16:14,659 --> 01:16:17,002
[SPEAKER_07]: You know how when they advertise things, they have that tagline?

1003
01:16:17,202 --> 01:16:18,543
[SPEAKER_07]: It should be Rumble Roses.

1004
01:16:18,863 --> 01:16:19,504
[SPEAKER_07]: Look to the Boobies.

1005
01:16:21,326 --> 01:16:22,207
[SPEAKER_07]: Look to the Boobies.

1006
01:16:23,333 --> 01:16:24,933
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome action gameplay.

1007
01:16:25,094 --> 01:16:26,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Realistic, rusty moves.

1008
01:16:26,434 --> 01:16:27,634
[SPEAKER_17]: Lots of boobies!

1009
01:16:28,834 --> 01:16:29,334
[SPEAKER_17]: And mud.

1010
01:16:29,614 --> 01:16:30,675
[SPEAKER_17]: Don't forget the mud.

1011
01:16:30,695 --> 01:16:31,815
[SPEAKER_17]: The flesh-colored mud.

1012
01:16:32,015 --> 01:16:33,015
[SPEAKER_07]: Look to the boobies.

1013
01:16:33,215 --> 01:16:33,995
[SPEAKER_07]: True color mix.

1014
01:16:34,596 --> 01:16:34,876
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1015
01:16:35,836 --> 01:16:36,956
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, I'm hanging up on you, Mullet.

1016
01:16:36,976 --> 01:16:38,116
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got to let some other people call in.

1017
01:16:38,316 --> 01:16:38,576
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, bye.

1018
01:16:38,596 --> 01:16:40,177
[SPEAKER_07]: But thanks for the input, as always.

1019
01:16:41,237 --> 01:16:41,717
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a good one.

1020
01:16:43,077 --> 01:16:44,538
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay, it's always good to talk to you.

1021
01:16:44,658 --> 01:16:47,158
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, we'll reopen the Skype line if somebody else wants to call in.

1022
01:16:48,139 --> 01:16:50,179
[SPEAKER_07]: And let us know their thoughts on DDR Extreme USA.

1023
01:16:51,394 --> 01:16:55,837
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to have to kind of start shifting gears here in a little bit, though, because we definitely want to get to the cage match.

1024
01:16:55,877 --> 01:17:02,442
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, now we've got to get to our FUs, and I still want to talk about In the Groove at some point, and all that other stuff as well.

1025
01:17:02,482 --> 01:17:03,943
[SPEAKER_17]: Wasn't that a Madonna song?

1026
01:17:05,164 --> 01:17:06,565
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that's Into the Groove.

1027
01:17:07,045 --> 01:17:09,086
[SPEAKER_07]: That's Into the Groove, not In the Groove.

1028
01:17:09,627 --> 01:17:10,688
[SPEAKER_07]: In the Groove's a little different.

1029
01:17:13,149 --> 01:17:14,070
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay, another caller.

1030
01:17:15,091 --> 01:17:17,092
[SPEAKER_07]: Howdy, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1031
01:17:17,152 --> 01:17:17,593
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up?

1032
01:17:18,513 --> 01:17:19,334
[SPEAKER_07]: Yo, it's Dork.

1033
01:17:19,654 --> 01:17:21,035
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Dork, what's going on?

1034
01:17:23,296 --> 01:17:25,236
[SPEAKER_07]: I love this name.

1035
01:17:25,737 --> 01:17:30,619
[SPEAKER_07]: I swear, I'm declaring that our listeners have the coolest handles on the internet.

1036
01:17:30,879 --> 01:17:33,440
[SPEAKER_07]: Between like El Mullet and Dork, come on.

1037
01:17:33,580 --> 01:17:35,421
[SPEAKER_17]: Hey, you guys win at the internet.

1038
01:17:35,441 --> 01:17:36,341
[SPEAKER_07]: Captain Canada, yeah.

1039
01:17:36,701 --> 01:17:37,762
[SPEAKER_17]: You guys win at the internet.

1040
01:17:38,482 --> 01:17:39,862
[SPEAKER_17]: Hey, Dork, guess who?

1041
01:17:42,223 --> 01:17:44,865
[SPEAKER_28]: Anyways, on the subject of... Oh, fine, don't guess who.

1042
01:17:45,125 --> 01:17:45,965
[SPEAKER_07]: You're fired.

1043
01:17:45,985 --> 01:17:47,446
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm sorry, what's up?

1044
01:17:47,526 --> 01:17:48,326
[SPEAKER_07]: Angel's taking over.

1045
01:17:48,366 --> 01:17:49,466
[SPEAKER_28]: What's up, Dork?

1046
01:17:50,147 --> 01:17:50,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Never mind.

1047
01:17:50,507 --> 01:17:50,907
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up, Dork?

1048
01:17:51,804 --> 01:17:51,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

1049
01:17:52,424 --> 01:17:52,645
[SPEAKER_28]: Hi.

1050
01:17:53,725 --> 01:17:53,945
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh?

1051
01:17:54,205 --> 01:17:54,746
[SPEAKER_28]: Repeat, please.

1052
01:17:54,766 --> 01:17:55,226
[SPEAKER_07]: What's going on?

1053
01:17:55,246 --> 01:17:55,946
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, you have to repeat.

1054
01:17:55,966 --> 01:17:56,547
[SPEAKER_07]: There was chaos.

1055
01:17:58,788 --> 01:17:59,448
[SPEAKER_28]: Uh, wait.

1056
01:17:59,748 --> 01:17:59,969
[SPEAKER_28]: What?

1057
01:18:00,649 --> 01:18:01,349
[SPEAKER_28]: Angel was talking?

1058
01:18:01,630 --> 01:18:02,190
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, she was.

1059
01:18:02,210 --> 01:18:02,930
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, but it's your turn.

1060
01:18:02,970 --> 01:18:03,310
[SPEAKER_07]: That's alright.

1061
01:18:03,350 --> 01:18:03,771
[SPEAKER_07]: It's your turn.

1062
01:18:03,811 --> 01:18:04,111
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up?

1063
01:18:04,331 --> 01:18:05,292
[SPEAKER_07]: No, what did she say?

1064
01:18:05,912 --> 01:18:07,093
[SPEAKER_07]: She was trying to say hi.

1065
01:18:07,753 --> 01:18:10,194
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think there's a delay or something and it messed everything up.

1066
01:18:10,294 --> 01:18:10,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, what's up?

1067
01:18:11,055 --> 01:18:12,255
[SPEAKER_07]: What's your thoughts on Extreme?

1068
01:18:13,136 --> 01:18:16,238
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, uh, I got some good thoughts and bad thoughts.

1069
01:18:16,278 --> 01:18:20,460
[SPEAKER_28]: I kind of said some good and bad on Wednesday, but eh.

1070
01:18:21,260 --> 01:18:24,723
[SPEAKER_28]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1071
01:18:41,877 --> 01:18:45,338
[SPEAKER_07]: But for the most part, you have to remember, you have to satisfy everybody.

1072
01:18:45,438 --> 01:18:49,758
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's always the way the song list could be improved to match our own personal tastes.

1073
01:18:49,838 --> 01:18:55,099
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you change the song list to what you would like, then somebody else would hate the game.

1074
01:18:55,459 --> 01:18:56,099
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know.

1075
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:57,620
[SPEAKER_07]: But I understand, I understand.

1076
01:18:57,680 --> 01:18:59,140
[SPEAKER_07]: You could always just have more songs, hey?

1077
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:03,841
[SPEAKER_28]: Maybe so, but... Let's see here.

1078
01:19:05,641 --> 01:19:06,001
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know.

1079
01:19:06,261 --> 01:19:10,782
[SPEAKER_28]: I kind of figure that Oni and Nonstop are a bit too easy, don't you think?

1080
01:19:12,169 --> 01:19:13,049
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, maybe.

1081
01:19:13,090 --> 01:19:25,535
[SPEAKER_07]: I think some of the non-stops are a little bit too easy, but then again, everything is difficult with that dance play option being gone, so... Yeah, but then again, to negate all that, you have Mission Mode.

1082
01:19:26,075 --> 01:19:26,375
[SPEAKER_07]: That's true.

1083
01:19:26,395 --> 01:19:27,255
[SPEAKER_28]: Which is really awesome.

1084
01:19:27,315 --> 01:19:28,556
[SPEAKER_07]: Mission Mode is very awesome.

1085
01:19:28,936 --> 01:19:32,077
[SPEAKER_28]: It's one of the coolest things in DDR yet, next to online play.

1086
01:19:32,978 --> 01:19:38,480
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, by the way, the Frozen Ray on Heavy with the one on Dark, Reverse, and...

1087
01:19:39,744 --> 01:19:42,146
[SPEAKER_28]: Mixed Up Arrows, that's Mission 98.

1088
01:19:43,507 --> 01:19:44,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Mission 98, thank you.

1089
01:19:44,687 --> 01:19:46,809
[SPEAKER_07]: We haven't gotten there yet, we're a little slow.

1090
01:19:47,929 --> 01:19:48,210
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah.

1091
01:19:49,270 --> 01:19:52,332
[SPEAKER_28]: I tried that one up to like 100-something times already.

1092
01:19:53,713 --> 01:19:56,195
[SPEAKER_07]: So on a scale of 1 to 5, how would you rate DDR Extreme?

1093
01:19:59,757 --> 01:19:56,195
2.

1094
01:19:59,777 --> 01:20:00,477
[SPEAKER_07]: 2?

1095
01:19:59,997 --> 01:20:00,477
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, ouch.

1096
01:20:01,378 --> 01:20:04,820
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, what would you say was your least favorite thing about the whole game?

1097
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:05,760
[SPEAKER_07]: Least favorite.

1098
01:20:07,522 --> 01:20:08,002
[SPEAKER_07]: Songless.

1099
01:20:08,561 --> 01:20:10,743
[SPEAKER_07]: Songlist, ouch.

1100
01:20:11,543 --> 01:20:12,284
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe next time.

1101
01:20:12,304 --> 01:20:13,625
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe next time.

1102
01:20:14,165 --> 01:20:16,266
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, we're going to let you go so we can talk to some other folks.

1103
01:20:17,307 --> 01:20:18,668
[SPEAKER_07]: But thanks for the call, Dork.

1104
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:19,269
[SPEAKER_07]: We appreciate it.

1105
01:20:20,249 --> 01:20:20,790
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a good one.

1106
01:20:32,198 --> 01:20:35,380
[SPEAKER_17]: I can feel the evil vibe building in this room.

1107
01:20:35,860 --> 01:20:36,100
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

1108
01:20:36,140 --> 01:20:37,481
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks to Loki's device.

1109
01:20:37,501 --> 01:20:40,562
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh God, Loki's trying to finish his little device over there.

1110
01:20:40,583 --> 01:20:43,604
[SPEAKER_07]: The one he's been working on for the past three episodes or something.

1111
01:20:45,185 --> 01:20:46,766
[SPEAKER_17]: I feel the evil is close.

1112
01:20:48,086 --> 01:20:51,008
[SPEAKER_17]: I feel that Satan's going to come up and just burn up the floor.

1113
01:20:51,288 --> 01:20:52,348
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, we got another caller.

1114
01:20:52,368 --> 01:20:53,469
[SPEAKER_07]: This is going to be the last one for now.

1115
01:20:53,989 --> 01:20:54,229
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up?

1116
01:20:56,337 --> 01:20:57,117
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey there, Dark Knight.

1117
01:20:57,157 --> 01:20:58,298
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad to get the last call.

1118
01:20:58,498 --> 01:20:59,218
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Dark Knight.

1119
01:20:59,238 --> 01:21:01,519
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it won't be the last call ever, but for this segment.

1120
01:21:01,559 --> 01:21:04,141
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if we have time at the end of the show, we'll take more extreme thoughts.

1121
01:21:04,161 --> 01:21:05,121
[SPEAKER_14]: It is the ultimate call.

1122
01:21:05,761 --> 01:21:06,442
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it is.

1123
01:21:06,522 --> 01:21:08,182
[SPEAKER_07]: But for now, you're the lucky one.

1124
01:21:10,143 --> 01:21:10,663
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up?

1125
01:21:10,844 --> 01:21:12,604
[SPEAKER_07]: What's your thoughts on DDR Extreme, Dark Knight?

1126
01:21:13,645 --> 01:21:14,865
[SPEAKER_08]: It's okay.

1127
01:21:14,885 --> 01:21:17,266
[SPEAKER_08]: There are some little downsides to it, though.

1128
01:21:17,627 --> 01:21:17,927
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1129
01:21:17,947 --> 01:21:18,867
[SPEAKER_07]: What are the downsides?

1130
01:21:19,587 --> 01:21:21,208
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree with you with the dance play thing.

1131
01:21:21,248 --> 01:21:22,609
[SPEAKER_08]: I kind of noticed that when I looked at it.

1132
01:21:22,629 --> 01:21:24,189
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, something's missing.

1133
01:21:24,209 --> 01:21:25,090
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, uh...

1134
01:21:25,977 --> 01:21:28,117
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I can't cut the extra arrows off.

1135
01:21:28,237 --> 01:21:30,678
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the dance play thing was a real bummer.

1136
01:21:30,978 --> 01:21:31,378
[SPEAKER_07]: What else?

1137
01:21:32,078 --> 01:21:33,839
[SPEAKER_08]: Mission Mode was okay.

1138
01:21:34,079 --> 01:21:37,119
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm kind of slow because I'm still stuck on Mission 15.

1139
01:21:37,339 --> 01:21:37,939
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard!

1140
01:21:38,759 --> 01:21:40,680
[SPEAKER_08]: But they do have the crazy missions on there.

1141
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:44,981
[SPEAKER_08]: One, it was like all the arrows were bunched up into one big arrow.

1142
01:21:45,521 --> 01:21:46,901
[SPEAKER_08]: And you didn't know which way you had to hit it.

1143
01:21:47,041 --> 01:21:48,901
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't seen that one yet.

1144
01:21:49,481 --> 01:21:52,602
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like all the arrows get bunched, jammed into one arrow.

1145
01:21:54,022 --> 01:21:57,285
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, I have to... It scrolls like one line.

1146
01:21:57,445 --> 01:22:01,167
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki played like half a mission mode while I was out of town, but it's cool.

1147
01:22:01,228 --> 01:22:03,309
[SPEAKER_07]: I gotta look at some of these other missions that I missed out on.

1148
01:22:03,589 --> 01:22:05,251
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe I'll just erase the file and start over.

1149
01:22:05,931 --> 01:22:10,034
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it was like one mission where you have to deliberately get no goods on all freeze arrows.

1150
01:22:10,314 --> 01:22:12,016
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, I can't do that.

1151
01:22:12,056 --> 01:22:13,597
[SPEAKER_08]: My feet doesn't let me do that.

1152
01:22:13,737 --> 01:22:14,397
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

1153
01:22:14,658 --> 01:22:16,179
[SPEAKER_08]: I know I failed it like six times.

1154
01:22:16,239 --> 01:22:18,941
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the one where Maximizer can't get a combo higher than four.

1155
01:22:20,180 --> 01:22:26,543
[SPEAKER_08]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1156
01:22:49,213 --> 01:22:55,135
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, of course, they have the ability to go to challenge or non-stop during, like, while picking.

1157
01:22:55,235 --> 01:22:58,776
[SPEAKER_08]: Instead of, like, having to pick it early, you can pick it, like, on the song rotation.

1158
01:22:59,217 --> 01:22:59,557
[SPEAKER_08]: Huh.

1159
01:23:00,577 --> 01:23:05,079
[SPEAKER_08]: So, like, when you're looking at it, you see, you're, like, hearing the second song, and then all of a sudden, like, I want to do a challenge step.

1160
01:23:05,119 --> 01:23:07,279
[SPEAKER_08]: So you go to challenge, and you go to challenge mode.

1161
01:23:08,100 --> 01:23:09,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Gotcha, gotcha, yeah.

1162
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:11,301
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, like that one.

1163
01:23:13,112 --> 01:23:16,074
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess the odd stuff, Hyper Dash is the only thing I like on it.

1164
01:23:16,214 --> 01:23:18,875
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything else, I didn't even want to attempt to even try.

1165
01:23:19,756 --> 01:23:21,737
[SPEAKER_08]: Just by looking, I'm like, no.

1166
01:23:23,438 --> 01:23:23,738
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1167
01:23:24,838 --> 01:23:28,360
[SPEAKER_08]: All in all, I'll give the REX about at least an 8.

1168
01:23:29,301 --> 01:23:29,761
[SPEAKER_07]: An 8 out of 10?

1169
01:23:29,941 --> 01:23:30,962
[SPEAKER_08]: An 8 out of 10.

1170
01:23:31,302 --> 01:23:31,722
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1171
01:23:31,902 --> 01:23:32,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds good.

1172
01:23:32,443 --> 01:23:33,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, thanks for the call, Dark Knight.

1173
01:23:33,903 --> 01:23:36,245
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got to let you go because we're going to get to break, but thanks for your input.

1174
01:23:36,485 --> 01:23:36,925
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a good one.

1175
01:23:37,585 --> 01:23:37,866
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1176
01:23:38,066 --> 01:23:38,306
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1177
01:23:38,346 --> 01:23:38,546
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

1178
01:23:38,976 --> 01:23:43,420
[SPEAKER_07]: We will take more calls a little later on during the show about DDR Extreme USA and your thoughts.

1179
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:49,345
[SPEAKER_07]: We do like hearing what our listeners have to say because, you know, they know more than we do most of the time, which is the sad truth.

1180
01:23:49,705 --> 01:23:49,985
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1181
01:23:50,486 --> 01:23:51,707
[SPEAKER_07]: We are going to go to a break, though.

1182
01:23:51,747 --> 01:23:56,851
[SPEAKER_07]: When we come back, my review of In the Groove and the Cage Match when we get back.

1183
01:23:57,391 --> 01:24:00,774
[SPEAKER_07]: After this, starting off with some more licensed music from DDR Extreme.

1184
01:24:01,094 --> 01:24:02,856
[SPEAKER_07]: I know some folks in the chat room wanted to hear this.

1185
01:24:03,276 --> 01:24:03,857
[SPEAKER_07]: So here you go.

1186
01:24:03,917 --> 01:24:04,958
[SPEAKER_07]: Some music for you guys.

1187
01:24:05,018 --> 01:24:05,238
[SPEAKER_07]: Enjoy.

1188
01:24:23,215 --> 01:24:23,756
Thanks for watching!

1189
01:25:03,317 --> 01:25:04,139
Thanks for watching!

1190
01:25:46,167 --> 01:25:47,309
Thanks for watching!

1191
01:26:23,295 --> 01:26:48,205
[SPEAKER_19]: We will leave someday Your hand in my hand We will make our plans We will fight so high Tell all our friends goodbye We will be just like you This is what we'll do

1192
01:26:51,560 --> 01:26:52,801
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks for watching!

1193
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:45,841
Thank you for watching!

1194
01:28:58,567 --> 01:29:02,450
[SPEAKER_07]: Orange Lounge Radio, Bomani Music, and more.

1195
01:29:03,832 --> 01:29:21,226
[SPEAKER_07]: We are back with Orange Lounge Radio, talking about DDR Extreme USA mostly, but you know, just by coincidence, tonight was probably going to be dominated by DDR Extreme USA chat, but I got a chance to play In The Groove this week, which is the other Bomani-ish game.

1196
01:29:21,246 --> 01:29:23,468
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not really a Bomani game, but you all know the story.

1197
01:29:25,110 --> 01:29:25,310
[SPEAKER_07]: You want...

1198
01:29:25,874 --> 01:29:26,695
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

1199
01:29:26,735 --> 01:29:29,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, DarkSakura was barking orders at Angel.

1200
01:29:30,318 --> 01:29:31,579
[SPEAKER_07]: Just kidding.

1201
01:29:31,679 --> 01:29:33,821
[SPEAKER_17]: I asked very nicely, okay?

1202
01:29:34,261 --> 01:29:36,963
[SPEAKER_17]: I said, would you please get me a napkin?

1203
01:29:36,983 --> 01:29:37,824
[SPEAKER_07]: But you barked it a little.

1204
01:29:37,844 --> 01:29:38,344
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm kidding.

1205
01:29:39,105 --> 01:29:40,146
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll show you bark.

1206
01:29:41,507 --> 01:29:42,488
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1207
01:29:42,888 --> 01:29:43,148
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1208
01:29:45,350 --> 01:29:48,092
[SPEAKER_06]: In the Groove's been, it's controversial.

1209
01:29:48,433 --> 01:29:49,093
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's just leave it at that.

1210
01:29:49,133 --> 01:29:50,194
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a controversial game.

1211
01:29:51,255 --> 01:29:53,517
[SPEAKER_07]: Many folks are like, what the hell is this?

1212
01:29:54,119 --> 01:30:15,454
[SPEAKER_07]: It's basically, for those that don't know, the folks that did Stepmania, which is the DDR sim, teamed up with some other folks in Seattle, I guess, I don't know what they did before, teamed up with this Rockstore Games thing, to put together a new machine for the US, I'm assuming to make up for a lack of new DDR mixes in the US, although...

1213
01:30:16,602 --> 01:30:19,486
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure they would tell you this has nothing to do with DDR.

1214
01:30:19,526 --> 01:30:24,572
[SPEAKER_07]: They just want to make a brand new music game to kind of give something for the music fans to appreciate.

1215
01:30:24,873 --> 01:30:25,634
[SPEAKER_07]: So I got to play the game.

1216
01:30:26,707 --> 01:30:30,369
[SPEAKER_07]: I went to 8 on the Break where they are beta testing it, I guess.

1217
01:30:30,709 --> 01:30:34,891
[SPEAKER_07]: From what I understand, I actually checked one of the big websites, itgfreak.com.

1218
01:30:35,511 --> 01:30:36,772
[SPEAKER_07]: Funny, itgfreak.

1219
01:30:38,473 --> 01:30:43,635
[SPEAKER_07]: I checked this site out and it's apparently still a beta machine, even though the full version is out.

1220
01:30:43,995 --> 01:30:45,696
[SPEAKER_07]: But it looked pretty finished to me.

1221
01:30:45,816 --> 01:30:47,257
[SPEAKER_07]: It played pretty finished, I guess.

1222
01:30:48,638 --> 01:31:17,258
[SPEAKER_07]: but again it's a beta so some things I saw may have been different from the final version but I think for the most part my assessment will be on track and I realize there's people that love Indigroove and I realize there's people that hate it and hate everything it stands for so that being said my review of the game is basically going to be summed up with it's not as bad as people who brag on it would make you think it is it's not that bad but

1223
01:31:18,601 --> 01:31:18,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Good stuff.

1224
01:31:33,787 --> 01:31:34,708
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, the mines.

1225
01:31:35,068 --> 01:31:43,892
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought, now see this is one of those things that I wouldn't have known unless I played the game because I thought mines were a stupid idea to begin with until I actually got to play it and I thought it was actually really fun.

1226
01:31:44,212 --> 01:31:51,615
[SPEAKER_07]: The way the step charts were done, the mines were really smartly placed, it's a neat new feature for the game, I like the mines, the mines can stay.

1227
01:31:52,095 --> 01:31:56,237
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I think as for other step mania maker folks out there,

1228
01:31:56,806 --> 01:31:57,427
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

1229
01:32:17,559 --> 01:32:31,785
[SPEAKER_07]: In the Groove scores you on this percentage system, which is basically your score out of 100% of the possible, and this is how you can tell that this game is absolutely slanted towards people that perfect attack, which, when you look at the people that work on it, doesn't surprise me much, but that's fine.

1230
01:32:32,426 --> 01:32:35,147
[SPEAKER_07]: For a perfect attacker, you know, it's great.

1231
01:32:35,187 --> 01:32:38,748
[SPEAKER_07]: The scoring system's pretty smart, and I like the scoring system, it's cool.

1232
01:32:39,569 --> 01:32:42,650
[SPEAKER_07]: And just as I said, it takes perfect attack to the next level of

1233
01:32:43,470 --> 01:32:46,614
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't see a lot of stuff that looked very freestylable to me, however.

1234
01:32:46,914 --> 01:32:49,517
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think if you're more of a freestyler, I don't know.

1235
01:32:49,617 --> 01:32:55,665
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you may be liking some of the new songs, but it's definitely a perfect attacker's game.

1236
01:32:55,765 --> 01:32:56,586
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my assessment.

1237
01:32:57,267 --> 01:33:01,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Also like the fact that they have the Beatmania chart there where it does...

1238
01:33:02,168 --> 01:33:07,072
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it shows like a little graph that you can actually see where you sucked in the song and where you were good.

1239
01:33:07,472 --> 01:33:10,475
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, again, things cater to perfect attackers.

1240
01:33:10,615 --> 01:33:11,055
[SPEAKER_07]: I like that.

1241
01:33:11,576 --> 01:33:15,439
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, because now everybody is screaming and hollering in the chat room.

1242
01:33:15,499 --> 01:33:16,620
[SPEAKER_07]: As I said, it's a controversial thing.

1243
01:33:16,740 --> 01:33:18,361
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody feels very strongly one way or the other.

1244
01:33:18,601 --> 01:33:20,002
[SPEAKER_07]: This is just my big fat opinion.

1245
01:33:20,182 --> 01:33:21,584
[SPEAKER_07]: Take it, leave it, I don't care.

1246
01:33:24,346 --> 01:33:25,807
[SPEAKER_07]: This is something I put in my good column.

1247
01:33:26,187 --> 01:33:28,129
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not bad for a first mix.

1248
01:33:28,990 --> 01:33:30,511
[SPEAKER_07]: Considering this is the very first...

1249
01:33:31,203 --> 01:33:32,403
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care how you want to put it.

1250
01:33:32,543 --> 01:33:36,184
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't ignore that these people were obviously influenced by DDR significantly.

1251
01:33:36,384 --> 01:33:37,124
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a bad game.

1252
01:33:57,277 --> 01:34:00,019
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought there was more places where you could rank.

1253
01:34:00,820 --> 01:34:10,308
[SPEAKER_07]: I just thought the kind of ranking system was kind of cool, like you could rank in all these different spots, and every song had a top ten list, which I thought was kind of fun, so the ranking system was better.

1254
01:34:10,929 --> 01:34:15,493
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're a mode whore, you're in for a treat, because this thing has about a zillion different modes on it.

1255
01:34:15,633 --> 01:34:16,594
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't even read them all.

1256
01:34:17,455 --> 01:34:22,599
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not a mode whore, I could give a shit, but if you're a mode whore, you're gonna have a blast.

1257
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:23,060
[SPEAKER_07]: Enjoy.

1258
01:34:23,894 --> 01:34:24,414
[SPEAKER_07]: Zodiac by Banzai

1259
01:34:51,408 --> 01:34:52,750
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought that song was really cool.

1260
01:34:54,132 --> 01:34:56,475
[SPEAKER_07]: That's something I would like to play on the station sometime.

1261
01:34:57,056 --> 01:35:00,721
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe even do an In The Groove hour of songs or something, I don't know.

1262
01:35:01,742 --> 01:35:05,147
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought some of the cheesy cover songs... Oh, you guys did that last week when I wasn't here?

1263
01:35:05,962 --> 01:35:06,483
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, whatever.

1264
01:35:07,123 --> 01:35:08,685
[SPEAKER_17]: I thought some of the cheesy... You guys, nothing.

1265
01:35:09,906 --> 01:35:10,486
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Loki.

1266
01:35:10,546 --> 01:35:11,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki and Bradley.

1267
01:35:11,507 --> 01:35:13,268
[SPEAKER_07]: The guys, not girl and guys.

1268
01:35:13,549 --> 01:35:13,789
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1269
01:35:14,089 --> 01:35:22,356
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought some of the cheesy cover songs were really... As a person who appreciates the gay music, I thought the dance covers of Mouth and Torn were really cute.

1270
01:35:22,737 --> 01:35:23,958
[SPEAKER_07]: So I kind of like those songs.

1271
01:35:24,058 --> 01:35:25,219
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Missing Heart.

1272
01:35:25,399 --> 01:35:26,920
[SPEAKER_07]: There was like three Missing Heart songs in there.

1273
01:35:26,940 --> 01:35:28,441
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought that was awesome because I like Missing Hearts.

1274
01:35:28,782 --> 01:35:29,162
[SPEAKER_07]: It was cool.

1275
01:35:29,322 --> 01:35:29,502
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1276
01:35:30,703 --> 01:35:31,444
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you have Zodiac.

1277
01:35:31,484 --> 01:35:33,526
[SPEAKER_07]: Play a little clip of Zodiac for me because I like this song.

1278
01:35:34,306 --> 01:35:34,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty Please.

1279
01:35:35,587 --> 01:35:36,968
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually thought this song was really cool.

1280
01:35:37,188 --> 01:35:37,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Play a little bit for me.

1281
01:35:45,454 --> 01:35:47,095
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a real fun one to dance to.

1282
01:35:47,536 --> 01:35:49,237
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought this was like the best song in the whole mix.

1283
01:35:52,299 --> 01:35:55,782
[SPEAKER_07]: At the same time though, it's probably the song that gets incredibly whored out.

1284
01:35:56,923 --> 01:35:57,683
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's just my guess.

1285
01:36:00,245 --> 01:36:01,806
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, that was a little bit of Zodiac.

1286
01:36:01,886 --> 01:36:02,707
[SPEAKER_07]: I like that song.

1287
01:36:03,603 --> 01:36:05,584
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, okay, that's what I have in the good column.

1288
01:36:05,604 --> 01:36:06,225
[SPEAKER_07]: You ready for the bad?

1289
01:36:06,605 --> 01:36:06,825
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1290
01:36:07,045 --> 01:36:07,305
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1291
01:36:10,567 --> 01:36:12,548
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna take a lot of shit for this comment, but I don't care.

1292
01:36:12,588 --> 01:36:13,569
[SPEAKER_07]: This is how I honestly feel.

1293
01:36:13,629 --> 01:36:26,036
[SPEAKER_07]: As somebody who's been a fan of DDR for four years, or, what, three or four years, however long it's been, I realize these guys are taking a lot of shit for it being a blatant, like, for people saying it's too much like DDR.

1294
01:36:26,797 --> 01:36:27,877
[SPEAKER_07]: It is too much like DDR.

1295
01:36:28,017 --> 01:36:29,278
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a blatant DDR ripoff.

1296
01:36:29,538 --> 01:36:30,679
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, that's how I felt.

1297
01:36:31,343 --> 01:36:32,484
[SPEAKER_07]: I felt like I was playing DDR.

1298
01:36:32,544 --> 01:36:34,825
[SPEAKER_07]: I realize there's new stuff and they're trying to be different.

1299
01:36:35,206 --> 01:36:38,468
[SPEAKER_07]: My only suggestion is that it's not different enough.

1300
01:36:38,908 --> 01:36:44,572
[SPEAKER_07]: I think, now there's this whole argument going on about is it legal, is it not, is it legal, is it not.

1301
01:36:44,812 --> 01:36:45,953
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know where that stands.

1302
01:36:46,093 --> 01:36:46,533
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care.

1303
01:36:46,593 --> 01:36:47,173
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not my issue.

1304
01:36:47,314 --> 01:36:47,834
[SPEAKER_07]: What, Loki?

1305
01:36:48,194 --> 01:36:49,015
[SPEAKER_07]: It is DDR.

1306
01:36:49,095 --> 01:36:54,678
[SPEAKER_04]: It's only changed from DDR enough to make it not so they can't get sued.

1307
01:36:54,959 --> 01:36:56,179
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty much what it is.

1308
01:36:56,520 --> 01:36:57,720
[SPEAKER_04]: It's basically, that's it.

1309
01:36:57,760 --> 01:37:00,202
[SPEAKER_04]: They only changed, they would have left it the same if they could have.

1310
01:37:01,078 --> 01:37:07,924
[SPEAKER_17]: And also I think that since it's not an actually re-engineered DDR, that it's, you know, ground up, they can't say that they stole the engine.

1311
01:37:08,044 --> 01:37:16,692
[SPEAKER_07]: But honestly, I think if Konami wanted to sue, and I don't know where this thing stands legally, but I think Konami does have a step to stand on.

1312
01:37:17,513 --> 01:37:19,215
[SPEAKER_07]: It is way too much like DDR.

1313
01:37:19,835 --> 01:37:20,896
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not different enough.

1314
01:37:21,076 --> 01:37:23,919
[SPEAKER_07]: I felt like I was playing DDR, different mix.

1315
01:37:25,681 --> 01:37:25,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

1316
01:37:26,599 --> 01:37:28,239
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought the interface was smooth.

1317
01:37:28,679 --> 01:37:31,660
[SPEAKER_07]: The interface was very smooth, but I thought it was very dry.

1318
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:34,641
[SPEAKER_07]: The backgrounds were boring and the arrows were ugly.

1319
01:37:34,701 --> 01:37:35,661
[SPEAKER_07]: It was an ugly game.

1320
01:37:36,101 --> 01:37:37,961
[SPEAKER_07]: It was not a pretty game to look at.

1321
01:37:38,381 --> 01:37:39,982
[SPEAKER_07]: It was an ugly interface, basically.

1322
01:37:40,442 --> 01:37:40,642
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1323
01:37:41,222 --> 01:37:44,083
[SPEAKER_07]: Compared to Feet of Fury, how did those arrows look?

1324
01:37:44,103 --> 01:37:46,803
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, compared to Feet of Fury, it looked great.

1325
01:37:47,123 --> 01:37:50,884
[SPEAKER_07]: But honestly, part of what attracted me to DDR in the beginning was that very...

1326
01:37:51,661 --> 01:37:52,903
[SPEAKER_07]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1327
01:38:08,931 --> 01:38:10,492
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the thing that bugged me most about the game.

1328
01:38:10,672 --> 01:38:12,433
[SPEAKER_07]: And I realize it bugs a lot of people too as well.

1329
01:38:12,713 --> 01:38:15,454
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have played it, and I did get forced to do this in some songs.

1330
01:38:15,834 --> 01:38:19,596
[SPEAKER_07]: I think hand plants are the stupidest thing in the entire game.

1331
01:38:19,936 --> 01:38:21,577
[SPEAKER_07]: And the game acknowledges... You think you hand plant?

1332
01:38:22,137 --> 01:38:22,417
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1333
01:38:22,938 --> 01:38:25,539
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're forced... That went out like years ago.

1334
01:38:26,339 --> 01:38:27,260
[SPEAKER_04]: You can turn them off.

1335
01:38:27,460 --> 01:38:31,382
[SPEAKER_07]: I was not able to... There were so many modes, I couldn't even see where to turn it off.

1336
01:38:31,402 --> 01:38:32,242
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's fine.

1337
01:38:32,442 --> 01:38:33,843
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand you can turn them off.

1338
01:38:34,283 --> 01:38:36,544
[SPEAKER_07]: My point is, they are retarded in the first place.

1339
01:38:37,045 --> 01:38:40,868
[SPEAKER_07]: They are really retarded, and they were not put smart.

1340
01:38:40,949 --> 01:38:44,972
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I was playing songs, and suddenly these hand plants would come up, and I just kind of sighed.

1341
01:38:45,292 --> 01:38:47,635
[SPEAKER_07]: I did not feel like throwing my back out to hit them.

1342
01:38:47,955 --> 01:38:48,976
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not dancing.

1343
01:38:49,296 --> 01:38:52,299
[SPEAKER_07]: That is monkey flailing, is when you do those hand plants.

1344
01:38:52,739 --> 01:38:53,240
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what?

1345
01:38:53,260 --> 01:38:55,762
[SPEAKER_07]: And I realize it's borderline dancing at first, but the hand plants were stupid.

1346
01:38:55,782 --> 01:39:02,087
[SPEAKER_17]: With everything you've said about in the group so far, even the good stuff, it doesn't sound enough to me to even give a rat's ass about it, honestly.

1347
01:39:02,107 --> 01:39:02,528
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I think...

1348
01:39:03,436 --> 01:39:07,959
[SPEAKER_07]: I honestly think that everybody who is a fan of Bomani should try it once.

1349
01:39:08,759 --> 01:39:09,400
[SPEAKER_07]: It's different.

1350
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:10,380
[SPEAKER_07]: It's worth a look.

1351
01:39:11,361 --> 01:39:14,363
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, my thing is form your own opinion.

1352
01:39:14,483 --> 01:39:15,403
[SPEAKER_07]: Play it, form your own opinion.

1353
01:39:16,084 --> 01:39:21,367
[SPEAKER_17]: Of course, if someone wants to play a really ass of dancing games, there was that Jaleco one.

1354
01:39:24,709 --> 01:39:25,309
[SPEAKER_16]: What was that one?

1355
01:39:27,050 --> 01:39:28,791
[SPEAKER_17]: Stepping Stage.

1356
01:39:29,172 --> 01:39:30,412
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think that is Stepping Stage.

1357
01:39:30,552 --> 01:39:31,093
[SPEAKER_07]: Stepping Selection.

1358
01:39:31,113 --> 01:39:31,793
[SPEAKER_07]: Stepping Selection.

1359
01:39:31,873 --> 01:39:32,494
[SPEAKER_17]: That was that one.

1360
01:39:35,877 --> 01:39:37,058
[SPEAKER_17]: No game is as bad as that.

1361
01:39:38,678 --> 01:39:48,063
[SPEAKER_07]: And I realize it's not really dancing in the first place, but the hand plants, it's what I hate about Pump It Up and it's what I hate about it in the group.

1362
01:39:48,723 --> 01:39:50,364
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, that's just, I hated it.

1363
01:39:51,884 --> 01:39:55,386
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought, this is going to sound really cold.

1364
01:39:55,974 --> 01:39:59,916
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it was kind of stupid that the step chart makers had a credit.

1365
01:40:00,676 --> 01:40:04,138
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not talking about something like it's in the credits of the game.

1366
01:40:04,278 --> 01:40:13,923
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm talking about when you select a song and you go into the song, it shows in the same font size and type in the bottom corner, song name, song artist, and the step chart artist.

1367
01:40:15,302 --> 01:40:17,202
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, the effort went into making the step charts.

1368
01:40:17,222 --> 01:40:18,083
[SPEAKER_17]: You should have some credit.

1369
01:40:19,043 --> 01:40:20,503
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the credit can be given at the end of the game.

1370
01:40:20,543 --> 01:40:25,324
[SPEAKER_07]: This was the part that kind of bugged me, is that in most songs that I played, it was the same person every time.

1371
01:40:25,845 --> 01:40:27,545
[SPEAKER_07]: Did that person put a lot of work in the game?

1372
01:40:27,605 --> 01:40:28,905
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, I'm not going to debate that.

1373
01:40:28,945 --> 01:40:35,807
[SPEAKER_07]: But the thing is, I don't think that person deserves as much credit as the person who created the song, for God's sake, the artist and the song you're dancing to.

1374
01:40:36,447 --> 01:40:39,668
[SPEAKER_07]: I realize it's a little thing, and I'm probably going to get shit for that comment, but I don't care.

1375
01:40:40,228 --> 01:40:43,409
[SPEAKER_07]: It's something that struck me as kind of like, I kind of went, that's kind of dorky.

1376
01:40:43,969 --> 01:40:46,891
[SPEAKER_07]: It's totally something, though, I would expect from the Sim scene.

1377
01:40:52,655 --> 01:40:54,396
[SPEAKER_07]: If I was a beginner, I wouldn't want to play in the groove.

1378
01:40:54,876 --> 01:40:56,457
[SPEAKER_07]: It has a really nice tutorial mode.

1379
01:40:56,797 --> 01:40:57,418
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll give it that.

1380
01:40:57,538 --> 01:40:59,919
[SPEAKER_07]: It's probably better than anything DDR has for beginners.

1381
01:41:00,300 --> 01:41:05,403
[SPEAKER_07]: But kind of looking at it, if I was new and I was walking into the arcade and I was looking at it, I wouldn't want to play it.

1382
01:41:07,697 --> 01:41:08,837
[SPEAKER_07]: But the interface is to hold turn off.

1383
01:41:09,117 --> 01:41:14,839
[SPEAKER_07]: When I was playing, the CD skipped, and it caused the whole game to skip, and it caused the arrows to skip.

1384
01:41:15,159 --> 01:41:19,500
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of like the Ultramix glitch that some of the service packs have.

1385
01:41:19,560 --> 01:41:21,100
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very similar to that effect.

1386
01:41:21,620 --> 01:41:26,161
[SPEAKER_07]: And since this game is so heavily based on Perfect Attack, that is a big no-no.

1387
01:41:26,701 --> 01:41:27,622
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a big no-no.

1388
01:41:28,742 --> 01:41:29,402
[SPEAKER_04]: CD skipped.

1389
01:41:29,582 --> 01:41:31,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Why the fuck is it running off of a CD?

1390
01:41:31,882 --> 01:41:33,323
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got a fucking hard drive in it.

1391
01:41:33,463 --> 01:41:34,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Run off the hard drive.

1392
01:41:34,602 --> 01:41:35,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, okay.

1393
01:41:35,203 --> 01:41:37,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, why the game... The game should not be lagging at all.

1394
01:41:37,805 --> 01:41:38,946
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I gotta say.

1395
01:41:39,286 --> 01:41:39,687
[SPEAKER_04]: No lag.

1396
01:41:40,668 --> 01:41:46,193
[SPEAKER_07]: My thing is, I don't know if it's a CD skip or what it is, but it was like a CD skip.

1397
01:41:46,333 --> 01:41:50,156
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was kind of... bad.

1398
01:41:50,176 --> 01:41:53,139
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh... Lastly, I...

1399
01:41:53,547 --> 01:41:53,627
[SPEAKER_07]: D.D.R.

1400
01:42:14,399 --> 01:42:16,159
[SPEAKER_04]: What I would just say is, FoonMix did it better.

1401
01:42:17,120 --> 01:42:20,180
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to do the interface, Technolize did it better.

1402
01:42:20,660 --> 01:42:24,661
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, you put FoonMix songs and steps with Technolize's theme.

1403
01:42:24,721 --> 01:42:25,881
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, you've got a better game.

1404
01:42:26,342 --> 01:42:27,282
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it comes down to.

1405
01:42:28,202 --> 01:42:32,303
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's one point, but I will agree with you that FoonMix's steps were better.

1406
01:42:33,283 --> 01:42:36,364
[SPEAKER_07]: But FoonMix isn't an arcade game either, and I'm not talking about FoonMix right now.

1407
01:42:36,384 --> 01:42:37,524
[SPEAKER_07]: So, alright, there's the bad.

1408
01:42:37,584 --> 01:42:38,984
[SPEAKER_07]: So I gave you good, and I gave you bad.

1409
01:42:39,484 --> 01:42:43,045
[SPEAKER_07]: My final assessment is that everybody should try it at least once.

1410
01:42:43,900 --> 01:42:47,642
[SPEAKER_07]: But I honestly don't see this taking over DDR because here's my other point.

1411
01:42:47,722 --> 01:42:50,864
[SPEAKER_07]: While I was in the arcade, I just kind of observed in the arcade as well.

1412
01:42:51,324 --> 01:42:56,147
[SPEAKER_07]: While I was in the arcade, people were playing DDR non-stop.

1413
01:42:56,307 --> 01:42:58,188
[SPEAKER_07]: People came up and were playing DDR non-stop.

1414
01:42:58,308 --> 01:43:00,929
[SPEAKER_07]: I was one of three people the whole time I was there that played in the groove.

1415
01:43:01,690 --> 01:43:04,871
[SPEAKER_07]: I watched in my time there DDR make twice as much money as in the groove.

1416
01:43:04,991 --> 01:43:05,972
[SPEAKER_07]: A two-year-old game.

1417
01:43:06,772 --> 01:43:09,053
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the reality as far as I can see.

1418
01:43:09,073 --> 01:43:09,974
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't debate that.

1419
01:43:11,434 --> 01:43:12,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's another thing, too.

1420
01:43:12,695 --> 01:43:20,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Your average DDR mix, and I understand this is brand new hardware that they're adding to the scene and everything like that, your average DDR mix costs about $800 to upgrade.

1421
01:43:20,758 --> 01:43:24,300
[SPEAKER_04]: If you were going to take a third mix machine, upgrade it to Extreme, it'd be about $800.

1422
01:43:24,440 --> 01:43:30,103
[SPEAKER_04]: This sucker costs over $2,000 to upgrade for an arcade.

1423
01:43:30,443 --> 01:43:41,168
[SPEAKER_04]: An arcade that's risking, you know, adding this, I mean, cause, you know, DDR Extreme, sure, it may not be pulling in the crowds it was before, but you've already got that game, it's already been paying for it, and it's already, it's still making money.

1424
01:43:41,750 --> 01:43:42,671
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1425
01:44:10,916 --> 01:44:11,996
[SPEAKER_04]: This still will be good.

1426
01:44:12,417 --> 01:44:14,517
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just... That's been proven right there at Food Mix.

1427
01:44:14,557 --> 01:44:18,999
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that's not an arcade game, but it's all in-house artists, and the songs are really good.

1428
01:44:19,719 --> 01:44:20,719
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it comes down to.

1429
01:44:21,079 --> 01:44:24,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Songs are good, steps were innovative, the backgrounds were awesome.

1430
01:44:25,141 --> 01:44:27,602
[SPEAKER_04]: It's... They put more effort into it.

1431
01:44:27,962 --> 01:44:28,362
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

1432
01:44:30,763 --> 01:44:31,063
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1433
01:44:31,123 --> 01:44:32,183
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not talking about Food Mix.

1434
01:44:32,323 --> 01:44:35,204
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to finish up in the groove.

1435
01:44:35,264 --> 01:44:37,785
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to leave it on such a sour note, because I did talk about a lot of bad stuff.

1436
01:44:37,805 --> 01:44:40,346
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, I just want to reiterate, it's the first mix...

1437
01:44:41,624 --> 01:44:42,765
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it can only get better.

1438
01:44:42,885 --> 01:44:44,485
[SPEAKER_07]: For a first mix, it's not bad.

1439
01:44:44,885 --> 01:44:53,269
[SPEAKER_07]: But to me, and this is kind of my final say on it, I left playing this game the same taste in my mouth that I get when I play Pump It Up.

1440
01:44:53,469 --> 01:44:57,571
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't mean physically, but I mean basically the way I kind of react to Pump It Up.

1441
01:44:57,611 --> 01:44:59,712
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not like, oh, you know, cool, they have a Pump It Up.

1442
01:45:00,092 --> 01:45:02,393
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe I'll play that for fun once in a while.

1443
01:45:02,893 --> 01:45:04,454
[SPEAKER_07]: That's exactly how I feel about In The Groove.

1444
01:45:04,964 --> 01:45:06,165
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

1445
01:45:27,068 --> 01:45:29,029
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to open up the Skype line.

1446
01:45:29,489 --> 01:45:37,694
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe somebody wants to say something about it, but I'm not going to have it open very long because I want to get to the cage match because we're starting to run late.

1447
01:45:49,637 --> 01:45:54,859
[SPEAKER_07]: But, yeah, I do want to allow, you know, if there's somebody that has a counterpoint, I want to give them a chance to speak back.

1448
01:45:55,239 --> 01:45:59,861
[SPEAKER_07]: So, www.orangeonstrater.com, click on interact with us if you want to interact with the show.

1449
01:46:00,421 --> 01:46:02,441
[SPEAKER_07]: And give us a shout on the Skype line.

1450
01:46:03,462 --> 01:46:06,643
[SPEAKER_07]: And let's see what you have to say while I set up for the cage match here.

1451
01:46:07,303 --> 01:46:13,665
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I guess In The Groove has gone gold or whatever and they're shipping to different arcades and what have you.

1452
01:46:13,825 --> 01:46:15,326
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, we're getting a call from our old buddy.

1453
01:46:15,799 --> 01:46:16,520
[SPEAKER_07]: Jason!

1454
01:46:16,580 --> 01:46:17,140
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up, Jason?

1455
01:46:17,200 --> 01:46:18,261
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, it's me.

1456
01:46:18,521 --> 01:46:19,142
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course!

1457
01:46:19,642 --> 01:46:20,063
Of course.

1458
01:46:20,223 --> 01:46:21,464
[SPEAKER_07]: But I love hearing from Jason.

1459
01:46:21,524 --> 01:46:22,225
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up, Jason?

1460
01:46:22,245 --> 01:46:23,906
[SPEAKER_07]: You got something you want to say about In The Groove?

1461
01:46:24,807 --> 01:46:27,469
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a few things that are always on my mind about this.

1462
01:46:27,890 --> 01:46:28,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1463
01:46:28,250 --> 01:46:30,172
[SPEAKER_03]: One little side note of something you said earlier.

1464
01:46:30,452 --> 01:46:38,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Rocksaur Games made, basically they took the number one game that comes with most Linux distributions called Tux Racer.

1465
01:46:38,982 --> 01:46:46,445
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically a little racer with the penguin Tux mascot for Linux and they put it in an arcade game and shipped it out to arcades.

1466
01:46:48,025 --> 01:46:49,466
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually have one out here.

1467
01:46:49,586 --> 01:46:51,427
[SPEAKER_07]: I never knew that.

1468
01:46:51,707 --> 01:46:52,627
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of funny.

1469
01:46:52,927 --> 01:46:55,628
[SPEAKER_03]: If you go to the Rocks or Games Company website, there's two things.

1470
01:46:55,888 --> 01:46:57,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Tux racer and the groove.

1471
01:46:57,789 --> 01:46:58,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways.

1472
01:46:59,970 --> 01:47:02,871
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess you'll kind of leave it at that point then.

1473
01:47:02,911 --> 01:47:04,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1474
01:47:05,552 --> 01:47:06,612
[SPEAKER_03]: The two things that are kind of

1475
01:47:06,988 --> 01:47:13,735
[SPEAKER_03]: What's hanging me up about all this is that, first of all, the songs, I still want to hear all the songs.

1476
01:47:13,855 --> 01:47:14,796
[SPEAKER_03]: I still want a soundtrack.

1477
01:47:14,836 --> 01:47:15,917
[SPEAKER_03]: I still want to get all the songs.

1478
01:47:16,077 --> 01:47:17,358
[SPEAKER_03]: I do want to play the game.

1479
01:47:17,979 --> 01:47:27,028
[SPEAKER_03]: But already the variety is, you know, VR USA, a nice group of songs, but all along it's similar lines.

1480
01:47:28,208 --> 01:47:29,049
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure there are.

1481
01:47:29,189 --> 01:47:30,551
[SPEAKER_07]: I still want to play it.

1482
01:47:45,509 --> 01:47:51,594
[SPEAKER_03]: but yeah, the main two things that are on my mind, I don't know how many people I've told this to, maybe two or three people.

1483
01:47:51,634 --> 01:47:56,557
[SPEAKER_07]: We are about to tell two more, because that's how many people we have listening right now, two more.

1484
01:47:57,558 --> 01:48:10,228
[SPEAKER_03]: The arcade manager, like something to do with the arcade hardware manager for Rockstar, was standing like at the corner of the Konami booth at E3, and I was just kind of watching everybody play Extreme, and we had a nice little discussion.

1485
01:48:10,448 --> 01:48:13,110
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember that guy, I saw him too.

1486
01:48:14,051 --> 01:48:14,371
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's

1487
01:48:15,034 --> 01:48:19,336
[SPEAKER_03]: The two things that are hanging me up is that they're going to go for a copy of the Bomani series.

1488
01:48:20,577 --> 01:48:23,979
[SPEAKER_03]: He said they have eventual plans to start cloning the other games.

1489
01:48:24,339 --> 01:48:27,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Starting with Beatmania will most likely be their second.

1490
01:48:28,502 --> 01:48:31,323
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a nice idea because it gets more games in the US.

1491
01:48:31,483 --> 01:48:34,545
[SPEAKER_03]: It finally brings these here legitimately and with a variety.

1492
01:48:34,865 --> 01:48:35,566
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good thing.

1493
01:48:36,246 --> 01:48:41,549
[SPEAKER_03]: At the same time, it's this little company undertaking this whole task of all of this.

1494
01:48:41,989 --> 01:48:43,310
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to say they're just going to lose.

1495
01:48:44,028 --> 01:48:46,611
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, this isn't an easy thing to take

1496
01:48:57,306 --> 01:48:57,626
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1497
01:48:57,946 --> 01:48:59,027
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a difficult situation.

1498
01:48:59,227 --> 01:49:00,567
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a really difficult situation.

1499
01:49:00,987 --> 01:49:06,569
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think if Konami has issue with what's going on here, they need to do something about it now before it does get out of control.

1500
01:49:07,649 --> 01:49:09,470
[SPEAKER_07]: But maybe they can't do anything.

1501
01:49:09,670 --> 01:49:11,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe that's the sad part of it, is that maybe they can't do anything.

1502
01:49:12,031 --> 01:49:18,433
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, Konami US no longer has an arcade division anyway.

1503
01:49:18,473 --> 01:49:25,875
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole thing about that article was that they don't produce the machines here, but they can still get it through a third-party distributor.

1504
01:49:26,403 --> 01:49:27,883
[SPEAKER_03]: and the bookkeeping is done in Japan.

1505
01:49:27,983 --> 01:49:28,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Big deal.

1506
01:49:30,724 --> 01:49:31,564
[SPEAKER_03]: I do want to play it.

1507
01:49:31,624 --> 01:49:33,604
[SPEAKER_03]: If we ever got a machine here, I would play it.

1508
01:49:33,744 --> 01:49:34,464
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I would.

1509
01:49:36,525 --> 01:49:39,205
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to play it, but I just don't know what to expect from it yet.

1510
01:49:39,285 --> 01:49:42,706
[SPEAKER_07]: I think big arcades with a lot of Bomani games should get in the groove.

1511
01:49:42,746 --> 01:49:44,486
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just kind of a fun little alternative.

1512
01:49:44,786 --> 01:49:54,208
[SPEAKER_07]: And actually, I can see, because I've heard that this place that I went to has these big Friday night tournaments and stuff, and it does seem like it's a very tournament-friendly game.

1513
01:49:54,288 --> 01:49:55,668
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm kind of not surprised by that, so...

1514
01:49:57,226 --> 01:49:58,307
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't get it.

1515
01:49:58,327 --> 01:49:58,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

1516
01:50:24,996 --> 01:50:31,638
[SPEAKER_07]: I think big arcades that have lots of Babani games should get it just as an alternative, but I wouldn't recommend the whole world jumping on it.

1517
01:50:31,658 --> 01:50:34,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead of having three, four, or five extreme machines all in a row?

1518
01:50:34,758 --> 01:50:35,518
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exactly.

1519
01:50:36,179 --> 01:50:37,519
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no need for two extreme machines.

1520
01:50:37,559 --> 01:50:39,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Get a fourth plus, and then get into the group.

1521
01:50:39,439 --> 01:50:39,539
[SPEAKER_03]: Fifth!

1522
01:50:39,719 --> 01:50:40,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Fifth!

1523
01:50:41,420 --> 01:50:42,160
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, or fifth.

1524
01:50:42,200 --> 01:50:43,700
[SPEAKER_07]: Get a fourth plus or fifth, and then get into the group.

1525
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:44,741
[SPEAKER_13]: Fourth plus, fourth plus.

1526
01:50:45,661 --> 01:50:45,981
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1527
01:50:47,721 --> 01:50:48,321
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it for now.

1528
01:50:49,081 --> 01:50:49,622
[SPEAKER_03]: That's about it.

1529
01:50:49,682 --> 01:50:51,262
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there anything else you want to say, Jason?

1530
01:50:51,909 --> 01:50:57,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Console games are going to make this thing very interesting when they finally decide to start working on those.

1531
01:50:59,456 --> 01:51:00,977
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to be brave and say it doesn't happen.

1532
01:51:03,299 --> 01:51:09,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously this isn't the authority, but ITG Freak already has locked forums in place for whenever that actually starts.

1533
01:51:10,025 --> 01:51:11,266
[SPEAKER_03]: It is on their to-do list.

1534
01:51:12,126 --> 01:51:15,049
[SPEAKER_07]: Feel free to prove me wrong, but I'm going to say right now it's not going to happen.

1535
01:51:16,150 --> 01:51:18,472
[SPEAKER_07]: Feel free to prove me wrong, it's not going to happen.

1536
01:51:18,592 --> 01:51:19,613
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see what goes from here.

1537
01:51:19,912 --> 01:51:33,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, now supposedly, supposedly, that they have some sort of encryption thing that they did with this whole game on the hard drive on this thing where you couldn't, you know, say, I don't know, because it is basically Set Mania, you couldn't, I don't know, add songs to it.

1538
01:51:35,078 --> 01:51:49,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Supposedly they have this, something tells me that they don't, and I think that all you're going to have to do is buy this game and be like, hey, you know what, I don't want to buy your next upgrade for this thing, because they weren't going to do downloadable updates or something like that, that was one of the things I think they were talking about.

1539
01:51:49,941 --> 01:52:09,256
[SPEAKER_04]: And so basically you could say, you know, I like this DDR Extreme machine I have here, but what I'm going to do is I'm going to take all the songs from DDR Extreme that are already available for download on the internet, and I'm going to put them in this, you know, in the groove thing, and I'm going to call it In The Groove Plus.

1540
01:52:10,177 --> 01:52:12,438
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I'm going to sell it for $3,000 on the internet.

1541
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:14,400
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

1542
01:52:14,680 --> 01:52:15,301
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what's interesting?

1543
01:52:15,481 --> 01:52:17,302
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is something I completely forgot to say about In The Groove.

1544
01:52:18,503 --> 01:52:19,604
[SPEAKER_07]: I think what's going to be interesting about it

1545
01:52:20,879 --> 01:52:27,904
[SPEAKER_07]: is that basically, yeah, the irony of the situation is is that everybody's going to pirate it to play on StepMania and then they won't bother within the group.

1546
01:52:28,264 --> 01:52:30,025
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the irony of the whole thing, I think.

1547
01:52:31,086 --> 01:52:34,388
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's how, honestly, that's how most people are playing it right now.

1548
01:52:35,069 --> 01:52:38,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Even better, there's people out there bootlegging fucking DDR Extreme.

1549
01:52:38,571 --> 01:52:40,773
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going to stop them from fucking bootlegging this thing?

1550
01:52:40,793 --> 01:52:43,675
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be even easier and they'll be able to make it even better.

1551
01:52:43,695 --> 01:52:45,576
[SPEAKER_17]: That's going to hurt the smaller companies, too.

1552
01:52:45,756 --> 01:52:48,698
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, the less backing a company has, the more it's going to hurt them.

1553
01:52:49,239 --> 01:52:49,539
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1554
01:52:50,074 --> 01:52:54,739
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm digging myself deep enough hole as it is here with the In The Groove fans.

1555
01:52:55,199 --> 01:52:58,182
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll just end this and move along gradually back to the rest of the normal show.

1556
01:52:58,943 --> 01:52:59,763
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds normal.

1557
01:53:00,965 --> 01:53:02,326
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, thanks Jason for calling.

1558
01:53:05,369 --> 01:53:10,674
[SPEAKER_07]: I am offering a cordial invitation to anybody that worked on In The Groove.

1559
01:53:11,560 --> 01:53:21,408
[SPEAKER_07]: or anybody that worked on In The Groove or anybody that had something to do with the making of this game, I invite you to come on this show.

1560
01:53:21,448 --> 01:53:23,530
[SPEAKER_07]: We will set up a phone interview or something.

1561
01:53:23,810 --> 01:53:24,571
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on this show.

1562
01:53:24,931 --> 01:53:25,692
[SPEAKER_07]: Talk about your game.

1563
01:53:25,912 --> 01:53:27,733
[SPEAKER_07]: I would love to know what you guys have to say about this.

1564
01:53:27,894 --> 01:53:29,915
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, come tell me I'm wrong.

1565
01:53:30,976 --> 01:53:32,277
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell me there's going to be a home mix.

1566
01:53:32,477 --> 01:53:35,740
[SPEAKER_07]: I am perfectly fine with this, but I want to hear it from the official horse's mouth.

1567
01:53:36,541 --> 01:53:38,422
[SPEAKER_07]: So, open invite.

1568
01:53:38,482 --> 01:53:39,103
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be nice.

1569
01:53:40,987 --> 01:53:42,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Come to California, we'll buy you lunch.

1570
01:53:42,648 --> 01:53:44,369
[SPEAKER_07]: That's about all we can afford in our budget.

1571
01:53:44,449 --> 01:53:46,309
[SPEAKER_07]: A nice McDonald's lunch for our guests.

1572
01:53:46,730 --> 01:53:50,091
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, we can open it up to you.

1573
01:53:50,151 --> 01:53:51,192
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's take one more call.

1574
01:53:51,912 --> 01:53:52,792
[SPEAKER_07]: You're on Orange Lounge.

1575
01:53:54,513 --> 01:53:54,833
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello?

1576
01:53:54,873 --> 01:53:57,394
[SPEAKER_23]: Hey, your friendly neighborhood legend, Izaku.

1577
01:53:57,434 --> 01:53:58,315
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Izaku, what's up?

1578
01:53:59,495 --> 01:54:00,756
[SPEAKER_23]: I already played in the groove.

1579
01:54:01,956 --> 01:54:06,258
[SPEAKER_23]: Obviously because I live in the city and Port Authority bus terminals and you were in the groove place.

1580
01:54:06,779 --> 01:54:07,219
[SPEAKER_05]: What'd you think?

1581
01:54:08,589 --> 01:54:09,630
[SPEAKER_23]: So far, so good.

1582
01:54:09,710 --> 01:54:20,240
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, the songs are unique for the fact that this is probably the only alternative left, our last hope, because, you know, we're hearing word that this might be it.

1583
01:54:21,160 --> 01:54:24,503
[SPEAKER_23]: That, you know, DDR and the arcades might be on its last limb.

1584
01:54:24,543 --> 01:54:25,905
[SPEAKER_23]: People are going to get sick and tired.

1585
01:54:26,425 --> 01:54:27,706
[SPEAKER_23]: Hold on a second.

1586
01:54:27,726 --> 01:54:27,786
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes?

1587
01:54:28,627 --> 01:54:30,609
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I think somebody came in the room.

1588
01:54:31,249 --> 01:54:31,810
[SPEAKER_23]: Hold on a sec.

1589
01:54:32,130 --> 01:54:33,091
[SPEAKER_23]: Clean your room!

1590
01:54:33,698 --> 01:54:42,860
[SPEAKER_23]: No, someone's asking for my roommate, but anyways, yeah, DDR, yeah, people have been playing Xtreme for almost two years, they're gonna get cranky and sick and tired.

1591
01:54:43,080 --> 01:54:48,922
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's the thing, that's the thing, Zaku, is that I was at this place, and people were playing DDR Xtreme more than they were playing in the group.

1592
01:54:49,202 --> 01:54:58,264
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I realize it's just one day, and I realize it wasn't a tournament night or anything, but it was a Sunday afternoon, a random Sunday afternoon in the arcade.

1593
01:54:58,740 --> 01:54:59,921
[SPEAKER_07]: and there were more people.

1594
01:54:59,941 --> 01:55:02,162
[SPEAKER_07]: And it wasn't the same people playing DDR the whole time.

1595
01:55:02,182 --> 01:55:03,583
[SPEAKER_07]: There were more people playing DDR.

1596
01:55:04,443 --> 01:55:07,845
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not always... It's not always going to be... Oh, I'm sorry.

1597
01:55:07,885 --> 01:55:08,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

1598
01:55:08,205 --> 01:55:11,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, it's not going to always be tournament night at these other arcades.

1599
01:55:11,827 --> 01:55:14,989
[SPEAKER_04]: If this isn't doing good in this arcade, it's not going to do good in another arcade.

1600
01:55:15,750 --> 01:55:15,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

1601
01:55:16,010 --> 01:55:17,831
[SPEAKER_23]: It depends, though.

1602
01:55:17,851 --> 01:55:18,111
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean...

1603
01:55:18,920 --> 01:55:21,000
[SPEAKER_23]: Is that a princess phone ringing in the background?

1604
01:55:48,281 --> 01:55:49,062
[SPEAKER_23]: Is that a princess phone?

1605
01:55:49,082 --> 01:55:50,943
[SPEAKER_23]: That's not my phone, that's my roommate's phone.

1606
01:55:51,784 --> 01:55:52,064
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1607
01:55:52,785 --> 01:55:54,266
[SPEAKER_16]: Your roommate has a princess phone?

1608
01:55:56,407 --> 01:55:57,748
[SPEAKER_07]: Your roommate has a cute phone.

1609
01:56:00,070 --> 01:56:01,071
[SPEAKER_07]: It just sounds adorable.

1610
01:56:01,311 --> 01:56:02,012
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, Zaku.

1611
01:56:02,292 --> 01:56:03,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Finish your thought, because we've got to get to Cage Match.

1612
01:56:03,973 --> 01:56:09,817
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, he just left his phone right there, but... Finish your thought, Zaku.

1613
01:56:09,837 --> 01:56:10,838
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got to go to Cage Match soon.

1614
01:56:10,878 --> 01:56:12,319
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, pretty much it.

1615
01:56:12,379 --> 01:56:13,040
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, this is the...

1616
01:56:15,089 --> 01:56:24,994
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright, in other words, let's just put it, to sum it all up, alternative, in the groove equals alternative for those who have been playing DDR Extreme for the longest, ever since it first came out.

1617
01:56:25,554 --> 01:56:26,315
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll agree with you there.

1618
01:56:26,695 --> 01:56:27,495
[SPEAKER_23]: This is transitional.

1619
01:56:27,655 --> 01:56:28,416
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll agree with you there.

1620
01:56:29,016 --> 01:56:29,316
[SPEAKER_23]: Period.

1621
01:56:29,556 --> 01:56:29,857
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1622
01:56:30,497 --> 01:56:31,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a good one, Zaku.

1623
01:56:31,777 --> 01:56:32,398
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright, later.

1624
01:56:32,418 --> 01:56:32,638
[SPEAKER_07]: Later.

1625
01:56:33,498 --> 01:56:37,981
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's the funny thing, I agree, it's an alternative, not a replacement for DDR.

1626
01:56:38,261 --> 01:56:44,604
[SPEAKER_07]: But here's the funny thing, is that, you know, I say it at the same time, it's not a replacement for DDR, but yet it's, it is a rip-off of DDR.

1627
01:56:45,646 --> 01:57:07,832
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, anyway, before I say some more things that get me in trouble You know what, I didn't like Ultramix at first either And it suddenly became my favorite mix Home mix of all So, my opinion could change later on But for right now, that's how I feel Whatever, it's not all about me anyway As much as I like to think it is Hi guys, how are the rest of you guys doing?

1628
01:57:09,392 --> 01:57:14,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of you guys look like you're falling asleep Sorry, I'll shut up about it in the room now

1629
01:57:16,405 --> 01:57:17,786
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to get to the cage match.

1630
01:57:17,926 --> 01:57:20,248
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh yeah, cage match, that thing's cool.

1631
01:57:20,288 --> 01:57:21,328
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, let's get into the cage match.

1632
01:57:21,348 --> 01:57:22,129
[SPEAKER_16]: I miss the cage match.

1633
01:57:22,149 --> 01:57:32,556
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, the way the Orange Lounge Radio cage match works, we play three songs for you guys, you guys pick your favorite, and it goes into rotation all week long here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1634
01:57:32,576 --> 01:57:35,798
[SPEAKER_07]: We didn't do a cage match last week, so let's rewind to two weeks ago.

1635
01:57:36,299 --> 01:57:45,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie surprised us all when she beat Echo Image and something Loki had picked to win it with this Ska remix of Lupin the Third.

1636
01:57:46,545 --> 01:57:48,908
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's more like beach rock.

1637
01:58:04,597 --> 01:58:05,318
[SPEAKER_07]: and here it is.

1638
01:58:05,358 --> 01:58:08,221
[SPEAKER_07]: You only get to hear a clip of it because it was the last winner.

02:00:09,524 --> 02:00:10,305
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Lupin.

02:00:10,465 --> 02:00:11,026
[SPEAKER_07]: Lupin!

1653
02:00:11,667 --> 02:00:12,228
[SPEAKER_07]: Lupin the Third.

1654
02:00:12,248 --> 02:00:12,808
[SPEAKER_19]: Because it's French.

1655
02:00:13,149 --> 02:00:13,609
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

1656
02:00:14,430 --> 02:00:14,771
[SPEAKER_07]: Lupin.

1657
02:00:15,111 --> 02:00:15,652
[SPEAKER_07]: I like Lupin.

1658
02:00:16,192 --> 02:00:17,374
[SPEAKER_07]: We're gonna watch some Lupin.

1659
02:00:17,955 --> 02:00:21,096
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, my turn, this is my pick for tonight's cage match.

1660
02:00:21,356 --> 02:00:29,999
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm actually being lazy and just picking the song that I was going to play last week, because there was supposed to be a cage match last week, but, you know, things change, whatever.

1661
02:00:30,799 --> 02:00:32,119
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm just going to pick the same song.

1662
02:00:32,319 --> 02:00:38,961
[SPEAKER_07]: And I actually had written a little spiel for you guys to read, so I'm just going to go ahead and read that spiel now.

1663
02:00:39,021 --> 02:00:40,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see who's at the door.

1664
02:00:42,642 --> 02:00:43,743
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, hello, Jonas is here.

1665
02:00:43,783 --> 02:00:44,243
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, anyway.

1666
02:00:44,856 --> 02:00:49,418
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the little thing I was going to have Jamie read last week before the cage match.

1667
02:00:50,098 --> 02:00:50,959
[SPEAKER_17]: Except I was dead.

1668
02:00:51,059 --> 02:00:51,539
[SPEAKER_07]: That's alright.

1669
02:00:52,159 --> 02:00:58,362
[SPEAKER_07]: Since you cunts voted out Echo Image last week, I was going to pick Britney or some shit to torture you with in my absence.

1670
02:00:58,922 --> 02:01:04,285
[SPEAKER_07]: But this pretty kick-ass trance song came to my attention, and Jamie, I know how much you love trance.

1671
02:01:06,109 --> 02:01:09,273
[SPEAKER_07]: But it kind of sounds like tack in one part of it, so just listen to it.

1672
02:01:10,315 --> 02:01:16,604
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, I know Loki has a total hard-on for this artist, so I thought I'd beat him to the punch by putting this in tonight's cage match.

1673
02:01:16,884 --> 02:01:18,827
[SPEAKER_07]: It's also kind of long, so deal with it.

1674
02:01:19,287 --> 02:01:22,512
[SPEAKER_07]: This is song number two, Ono Ken, with Vijore.

1675
02:01:22,952 --> 02:01:23,273
[SPEAKER_07]: Enjoy.

1676
02:01:27,296 --> 02:01:29,839
Can I ask you a question?

1677
02:01:58,004 --> 02:01:58,624
Thank you for watching!

1678
02:03:33,015 --> 02:03:33,475
Thank you.

1679
02:04:37,995 --> 02:04:38,735
DarkSakura.com

1680
02:05:03,621 --> 02:05:04,464
Thanks for watching!

1681
02:07:56,347 --> 02:08:00,349
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, song number two in tonight's cage match, Ono Ken with Vigore.

1682
02:08:00,529 --> 02:08:00,969
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie!

1683
02:08:01,789 --> 02:08:02,449
[SPEAKER_17]: I really liked it.

1684
02:08:02,609 --> 02:08:15,594
[SPEAKER_17]: It wasn't... The trance I am sick of is the cookie cutter repetitive crap trance that people... Feel the beat, feel the beat, feel the beat, feel the beat, feel the beat.

1685
02:08:15,814 --> 02:08:20,296
[SPEAKER_17]: That was a lot more, what's the word I'm thinking of, progressive sounding.

1686
02:08:20,436 --> 02:08:22,957
[SPEAKER_17]: That was more what I liked.

1687
02:08:23,502 --> 02:08:24,843
[SPEAKER_07]: You liked it, and that's an upset.

1688
02:08:24,883 --> 02:08:25,724
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah, I liked it.

1689
02:08:26,225 --> 02:08:27,446
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a trance that you like.

1690
02:08:27,847 --> 02:08:30,549
[SPEAKER_17]: But cage match-wise, it was a little long.

1691
02:08:31,050 --> 02:08:33,492
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I would listen to it all the time otherwise.

1692
02:08:33,532 --> 02:08:35,935
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, that would be one of my songs on repeat.

1693
02:08:35,995 --> 02:08:38,117
[SPEAKER_17]: I would have to give it that high of a rating.

1694
02:08:38,678 --> 02:08:45,725
[SPEAKER_17]: However, because of Link, for cage match purposes, I would give it an 8, and this would be what I would have originally given it would have been a 9 otherwise.

1695
02:08:46,704 --> 02:08:47,104
[SPEAKER_07]: Fair enough.

1696
02:08:47,784 --> 02:08:50,925
[SPEAKER_07]: Jonas, who just came in the house a little bit ago, explicit.

1697
02:08:51,425 --> 02:08:52,566
[SPEAKER_07]: There's Mike over there for you guys.

1698
02:08:53,306 --> 02:08:55,786
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you got to hear a little bit of Ono Ken, so what did you think of Ono Ken?

1699
02:08:56,667 --> 02:08:57,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold the bottom when you talk.

1700
02:08:57,847 --> 02:08:58,167
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all.

1701
02:08:58,527 --> 02:08:58,967
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, what's up?

1702
02:08:59,948 --> 02:09:00,928
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give it a 9 out of 10.

1703
02:09:01,368 --> 02:09:01,808
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, good.

1704
02:09:02,248 --> 02:09:02,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1705
02:09:03,148 --> 02:09:03,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Well put.

1706
02:09:04,729 --> 02:09:05,929
[SPEAKER_07]: Angel, your thoughts?

1707
02:09:07,389 --> 02:09:09,190
[SPEAKER_13]: I really liked it.

1708
02:09:10,050 --> 02:09:11,611
[SPEAKER_13]: Kind of ravey, just my style.

1709
02:09:11,711 --> 02:09:12,951
[SPEAKER_13]: Definitely a 10 from me.

1710
02:09:15,401 --> 02:09:17,542
[SPEAKER_07]: My thoughts is I really liked it.

1711
02:09:18,063 --> 02:09:24,608
[SPEAKER_07]: It could stand to have been a little shorter, but I'm just lazy, so I give it a 9, because it's not the song's fault that I'm lazy.

1712
02:09:25,308 --> 02:09:25,669
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki.

1713
02:09:27,250 --> 02:09:27,710
[SPEAKER_04]: It was good.

1714
02:09:27,890 --> 02:09:31,153
[SPEAKER_04]: I've listened to it before, so I actually didn't even listen to the whole song at all.

1715
02:09:33,154 --> 02:09:34,555
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I've had this one forever.

1716
02:09:35,216 --> 02:09:35,997
[SPEAKER_05]: So on a scale of 1 to 10?

1717
02:09:36,137 --> 02:09:40,460
[SPEAKER_04]: I give it a 9, because it's... I wonder if you can do no wrong.

1718
02:09:41,343 --> 02:09:44,805
[SPEAKER_07]: Fair enough, and lastly but not, or I'm sorry, lastly but not leastly.

1719
02:09:45,786 --> 02:09:48,047
[SPEAKER_07]: I almost said lastly but not lastly.

1720
02:09:48,567 --> 02:09:48,908
[SPEAKER_07]: Arcadia.

1721
02:09:48,928 --> 02:09:50,529
[SPEAKER_17]: You said last but not loosely.

1722
02:09:51,989 --> 02:09:52,930
[SPEAKER_11]: We never knew that you were loosely.

1723
02:09:52,950 --> 02:09:53,330
[SPEAKER_11]: It was pretty cool.

1724
02:09:53,370 --> 02:09:57,613
[SPEAKER_11]: It reminded me of something out of DDR or 2DX or something.

1725
02:09:57,733 --> 02:10:04,537
[SPEAKER_11]: It had that background that was sort of, it was a bit repetitive on the background, but still it was pretty cool.

1726
02:10:05,478 --> 02:10:05,798
[SPEAKER_11]: I give it a 9.

1727
02:10:07,068 --> 02:10:09,550
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't you kind of get a little bit of a Taku vibe from it?

1728
02:10:09,610 --> 02:10:11,411
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, Still My Words-ish?

1729
02:10:11,592 --> 02:10:18,077
[SPEAKER_17]: No, there was another one that was... Like, what are those song tracks?

1730
02:10:18,337 --> 02:10:19,438
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, like Traces.

1731
02:10:19,898 --> 02:10:21,079
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, it made me think of Traces.

1732
02:10:23,741 --> 02:10:29,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, let's go on to Loki's pick, and I think he tried to come up with something at the last minute, but I don't think it worked.

1733
02:10:30,006 --> 02:10:31,367
[SPEAKER_07]: He's going back to an old favorite.

1734
02:10:32,395 --> 02:10:35,998
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I wasn't trying to come up with anything in the last minute, I was just seeing if I wanted to do any new shit.

1735
02:10:36,498 --> 02:10:37,259
[SPEAKER_04]: But, I had to check.

1736
02:10:37,439 --> 02:10:40,461
[SPEAKER_04]: And that also reminds me that fuckin' Diverse Systems hasn't sent me my CD.

1737
02:10:40,862 --> 02:10:46,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I understand that there's a little problem with that they weren't offering it to the US, but I thought I'd try ordering it anyway.

1738
02:10:47,507 --> 02:10:48,348
[SPEAKER_04]: And they have my money.

1739
02:10:48,828 --> 02:10:50,009
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't have a CD.

1740
02:10:50,249 --> 02:10:50,970
[SPEAKER_04]: And that makes me mad.

1741
02:10:51,970 --> 02:10:52,971
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as they send me a CD.

1742
02:10:53,912 --> 02:11:01,538
[SPEAKER_04]: But, anyways, um, so... No, I went ahead and decided that I'm gonna go ahead and try the Echo Image card again.

1743
02:11:02,315 --> 02:11:03,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

1744
02:11:48,996 --> 02:11:49,998
Thank you for watching!

1745
02:12:32,569 --> 02:12:33,530
Thanks for watching!

1746
02:13:35,097 --> 02:13:36,257
Thanks for watching!

1747
02:13:58,075 --> 02:13:59,276
Music Music Music Music

1748
02:14:38,981 --> 02:14:40,628
Thanks for watching!

1749
02:16:22,367 --> 02:16:29,309
[SPEAKER_07]: Song number three in tonight's cage match Echo Image with Come Back Jamie, come back and give us your vote

1750
02:16:32,257 --> 02:16:33,338
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, did I miss something?

1751
02:16:33,418 --> 02:16:34,038
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, you did.

1752
02:16:34,098 --> 02:16:34,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Echo Image.

1753
02:16:34,738 --> 02:16:35,098
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, yeah.

1754
02:16:35,858 --> 02:16:36,559
[SPEAKER_17]: It was good.

1755
02:16:36,619 --> 02:16:37,619
[SPEAKER_17]: I really liked that song.

1756
02:16:38,600 --> 02:16:46,102
[SPEAKER_17]: It was just so... I mean, again, that would be another one that I would just listen to endlessly, but I don't think it was quite cage-matchy.

1757
02:16:46,883 --> 02:16:48,463
[SPEAKER_17]: Still, I'm giving it an 8.

1758
02:16:49,584 --> 02:16:49,984
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1759
02:16:50,524 --> 02:16:50,844
[SPEAKER_07]: Fair enough.

1760
02:16:50,864 --> 02:16:51,184
[SPEAKER_07]: Bradley.

1761
02:16:56,366 --> 02:16:57,067
[SPEAKER_11]: Gotta grab a thing.

1762
02:16:59,928 --> 02:17:00,408
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, for me...

1763
02:17:01,240 --> 02:17:05,283
[SPEAKER_11]: The background is pretty good, but the lyrics and the way it's sung is kind of blah.

1764
02:17:06,064 --> 02:17:08,005
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I'll give it a 6.

1765
02:17:09,386 --> 02:17:09,806
[SPEAKER_30]: Alright.

1766
02:17:10,507 --> 02:17:10,787
[SPEAKER_30]: Angel.

1767
02:17:13,249 --> 02:17:16,031
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, duh, Echo Image 10.

1768
02:17:16,892 --> 02:17:18,633
[SPEAKER_13]: I know, I've been giving a lot of 10s lately, huh?

1769
02:17:18,693 --> 02:17:19,754
[SPEAKER_07]: You're the 10 whore.

1770
02:17:20,254 --> 02:17:21,235
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not a 10 whore.

1771
02:17:21,935 --> 02:17:24,477
[SPEAKER_07]: You're DDR Angel USA 10th Mix.

1772
02:17:24,577 --> 02:17:24,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1773
02:17:24,918 --> 02:17:28,060
[SPEAKER_13]: No comment.

1774
02:17:30,102 --> 02:17:30,622
[SPEAKER_07]: Exquisite.

1775
02:17:31,535 --> 02:17:32,655
[SPEAKER_01]: 8.5 out of 10.

1776
02:17:34,176 --> 02:17:35,656
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, 8.5 out of 10.

1777
02:17:36,337 --> 02:17:39,618
[SPEAKER_07]: My thoughts, you know what, it's kind of, this is really hard for me.

1778
02:17:39,938 --> 02:17:42,739
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that is like my favorite song at the moment right now.

1779
02:17:42,879 --> 02:17:43,919
[SPEAKER_07]: I love that song.

1780
02:17:44,399 --> 02:17:47,700
[SPEAKER_07]: And in most normal circumstances, I would give that song an 11.

1781
02:17:48,220 --> 02:17:55,822
[SPEAKER_07]: But the problem is that I kind of feel the way Jamie does where it's not quite the song I would see winning Cage Match.

1782
02:17:55,862 --> 02:18:00,824
[SPEAKER_07]: It is kind of slow and like, I think if that played in the middle of a dance music station, it would be kind of weird.

1783
02:18:03,036 --> 02:18:05,958
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm taking my 11 and bringing it down to like a 9.9.

1784
02:18:07,780 --> 02:18:09,882
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1785
02:18:09,942 --> 02:18:11,683
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know what, it's not up to us, it's up to you guys.

1786
02:18:11,723 --> 02:18:12,404
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Loki's got a vote.

1787
02:18:13,045 --> 02:18:14,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, duh, I do, don't I?

1788
02:18:15,947 --> 02:18:20,732
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I give it an 11 because I'm still listening to this in my car over and over again.

1789
02:18:20,752 --> 02:18:24,115
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know how long I've had this CD for and I still have listened to it.

1790
02:18:25,265 --> 02:18:26,026
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1791
02:18:43,946 --> 02:18:47,072
[SPEAKER_07]: Echo Image, CompuPhonic, you must get this CD.

1792
02:18:47,252 --> 02:18:48,375
[SPEAKER_07]: It is so good.

1793
02:18:48,976 --> 02:18:50,699
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all I listened to while I was back east.

1794
02:18:50,739 --> 02:18:52,041
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the only CD I had on me.

1795
02:18:52,602 --> 02:18:53,504
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm still not sick of it.

1796
02:18:53,624 --> 02:18:54,005
[SPEAKER_07]: I love it.

1797
02:18:55,047 --> 02:18:55,548
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway.

1798
02:18:56,880 --> 02:18:57,921
[SPEAKER_07]: Enough about what I think.

1799
02:18:57,961 --> 02:18:59,042
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get to what you guys think.

1800
02:18:59,202 --> 02:19:01,444
[SPEAKER_07]: And your chance to vote on tonight's winner.

1801
02:19:01,504 --> 02:19:03,887
[SPEAKER_07]: Here are those three songs one more time.

1802
02:19:03,907 --> 02:19:08,331
[SPEAKER_07]: Starting with a theme from Lupin the Third by Tokyo Paradise Ska Orchestra.

1803
02:19:17,780 --> 02:19:21,003
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, song number two tonight was Onoken with Vijore.

1804
02:19:31,565 --> 02:19:36,614
[SPEAKER_07]: And song number three tonight was Echo Image with Come Back.

1805
02:19:51,154 --> 02:19:53,855
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, place your vote now.

1806
02:19:53,976 --> 02:19:57,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.

1807
02:19:58,158 --> 02:20:01,359
[SPEAKER_07]: And Loki just found something on the internet that's very cool that we must find.

1808
02:20:02,200 --> 02:20:05,681
[SPEAKER_04]: They sung the NeverEnding Story, or a version of it.

1809
02:20:06,021 --> 02:20:06,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Echo Image.

1810
02:20:06,702 --> 02:20:08,623
[SPEAKER_07]: Echo Image did a version of NeverEnding Story, it looks like.

1811
02:20:09,103 --> 02:20:12,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I don't know if it's the same song, but it's got the same title, so I'm going to look for it.

1812
02:20:12,965 --> 02:20:13,765
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, we'll find out.

1813
02:20:14,986 --> 02:20:17,267
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so anyway, those are the three you get to vote for right now.

1814
02:20:17,347 --> 02:20:19,268
[SPEAKER_07]: Lupin, Vigore, or Comeback.

1815
02:20:22,319 --> 02:20:24,700
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, I'm going to open up the Skype line one more time.

1816
02:20:24,860 --> 02:20:31,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Any of your thoughts you want to talk to us about DDR Extreme USA, certainly, in the groove.

1817
02:20:31,363 --> 02:20:33,064
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll definitely want to hear your thoughts on that.

1818
02:20:33,984 --> 02:20:37,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Or anything you want to bring up right now, fine by me.

1819
02:20:39,100 --> 02:20:42,002
[SPEAKER_07]: And we will get into, of course, the cage match.

1820
02:20:42,902 --> 02:20:44,203
[SPEAKER_07]: Not the cage match, the FUs of the week.

1821
02:20:44,804 --> 02:20:45,284
[SPEAKER_07]: In a little bit.

1822
02:20:45,745 --> 02:20:48,227
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to give you guys a chance for your votes to come in first, though.

1823
02:20:49,047 --> 02:20:52,630
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, in the meantime, while we're waiting for a call, anything going on in the sim world this week?

1824
02:20:54,091 --> 02:20:54,692
[SPEAKER_04]: A few things.

1825
02:20:55,172 --> 02:20:57,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Alpha 24 came out last week, but I'll mention it again.

1826
02:20:59,195 --> 02:21:01,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing really new, I think, came with that.

1827
02:21:01,357 --> 02:21:02,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Except more bug fixes.

1828
02:21:02,998 --> 02:21:04,739
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, uh, Technolize...

1829
02:21:05,962 --> 02:21:13,108
[SPEAKER_04]: Version 2.8 finally got released with new, supposedly another Easter egg thing in that, probably some cool stuff in the background.

1830
02:21:13,509 --> 02:21:18,893
[SPEAKER_04]: And they have their unlock, or the unlock mode stuff is in there.

1831
02:21:18,933 --> 02:21:22,396
[SPEAKER_04]: They finished all the stuff for that and fixed some of the Alpha 24 problems.

1832
02:21:23,457 --> 02:21:30,964
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's also a poll going on DDR Maniacs right now, because the guy that did all the character ripping for 5th Mix is pretty much done with it now.

1833
02:21:31,391 --> 02:21:37,155
[SPEAKER_04]: And now he wants to know what other games you want to rip characters from, and he will go ahead and get on that.

1834
02:21:37,275 --> 02:21:41,698
[SPEAKER_04]: So I went ahead and voted for, I think, Party Collection or something.

1835
02:21:41,758 --> 02:21:46,242
[SPEAKER_04]: They wanted to do Ultramix, but I figured there's only two characters in Ultramix, so that's kind of a waste.

1836
02:21:46,602 --> 02:21:51,085
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're doing that right now, and I think that's pretty much it.

1837
02:21:51,105 --> 02:21:54,788
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not really much going on right now other than that.

1838
02:21:55,528 --> 02:21:57,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Sort of sim-related, they're going to have...

1839
02:21:58,376 --> 02:21:59,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

1840
02:22:20,430 --> 02:22:40,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Wave, or the Fura Fura mode, and .5 speed and all that wonderful stuff, and Break, that you can find in the arcade mixes, which is a free download I might add on DDRAmerica.com, a BitTorrent site, and you can actually, if you have a really kind operator at your local arcade, you can give that to them, and I'm sure they'll put it in there for you.

1841
02:22:41,205 --> 02:22:41,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Like ours.

1842
02:22:42,185 --> 02:22:45,688
[SPEAKER_04]: So, that's pretty much all that's going on at the moment.

1843
02:22:48,830 --> 02:22:49,911
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, fair enough.

1844
02:22:52,951 --> 02:22:55,693
[SPEAKER_07]: How long ago did you order that Diverse Systems CD that you still haven't gotten?

1845
02:22:56,613 --> 02:22:57,374
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple months ago.

1846
02:22:58,555 --> 02:22:58,875
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

1847
02:22:58,895 --> 02:22:59,575
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you going to write them?

1848
02:22:59,835 --> 02:23:01,416
[SPEAKER_07]: Contact the Better Business Bureau over it?

1849
02:23:02,297 --> 02:23:02,837
[SPEAKER_04]: They're Japanese.

1850
02:23:02,857 --> 02:23:04,218
[SPEAKER_04]: They can't understand my English.

1851
02:23:04,939 --> 02:23:06,660
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I'll try.

1852
02:23:06,980 --> 02:23:14,365
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll ask them, you know, hey... Because I still have the email, so I could email them again with that email later on once...

1853
02:23:15,101 --> 02:23:18,884
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm thinking that they're just not releasing to the US, so they're not going to send it to me.

1854
02:23:19,224 --> 02:23:26,909
[SPEAKER_04]: But later on, when the time comes when they do release it to the US, I'll be like, hey, I paid for this a long time ago, send me my fucking CD.

1855
02:23:27,549 --> 02:23:28,970
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's pretty much what it's going to come down to.

1856
02:23:29,651 --> 02:23:33,433
[SPEAKER_04]: And they'll have to, because I have my receipts still from that.

1857
02:23:33,593 --> 02:23:37,336
[SPEAKER_04]: It shows that it was paid for, so there's no disputing that.

1858
02:23:37,436 --> 02:23:40,998
[SPEAKER_04]: They can just say no, and then, I don't know.

1859
02:23:41,246 --> 02:23:45,568
[SPEAKER_16]: When you're dealing with international business, they don't necessarily have to send it to you.

1860
02:23:45,708 --> 02:23:48,589
[SPEAKER_16]: The business laws overseas are a lot different than they are here.

1861
02:23:50,490 --> 02:23:51,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't think it would be a problem.

1862
02:23:51,510 --> 02:23:54,872
[SPEAKER_17]: And you can't necessarily report a foreign business to the Better Business Bureau.

1863
02:23:55,392 --> 02:23:56,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I wasn't going to do that anyway.

1864
02:23:56,792 --> 02:24:03,115
[SPEAKER_17]: But I mean, I'm saying, if they don't ship it to you and you paid for it, there's not really much you're going to be able to do about it.

1865
02:24:04,115 --> 02:24:04,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1866
02:24:05,836 --> 02:24:06,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well.

1867
02:24:07,497 --> 02:24:09,097
[SPEAKER_04]: If not, I'm out that 50 bucks.

1868
02:24:09,538 --> 02:24:10,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that it really matters.

1869
02:24:12,190 --> 02:24:12,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1870
02:24:37,972 --> 02:24:38,813
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell me you didn't get your product.

1871
02:24:38,953 --> 02:24:42,915
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, anyway, let's talk about Cage Match and the winner of tonight's Cage Match.

1872
02:24:46,037 --> 02:24:50,520
[SPEAKER_07]: Two of the songs did alright, but it wasn't enough to beat the third song.

1873
02:24:50,560 --> 02:24:54,402
[SPEAKER_07]: Tonight's Cage Match winner is... Echo Image!

1874
02:24:59,185 --> 02:25:03,467
[SPEAKER_07]: Songs number one and two tied, but it weren't enough to overtake song number three.

1875
02:25:03,788 --> 02:25:06,009
[SPEAKER_07]: Song number three got about what one and two did combined.

1876
02:25:08,855 --> 02:25:10,456
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the power of Shane persuasion.

1877
02:25:10,917 --> 02:25:12,278
[SPEAKER_07]: Shane's persuasion in the chat room.

1878
02:25:15,021 --> 02:25:17,603
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn him for being a DDR celebrity all of a sudden.

1879
02:25:17,623 --> 02:25:20,226
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, people wouldn't have given a shit what he said previously.

1880
02:25:20,867 --> 02:25:21,667
[SPEAKER_07]: Just teasing you, Shane.

1881
02:25:21,988 --> 02:25:24,050
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's do another break.

1882
02:25:24,070 --> 02:25:27,753
[SPEAKER_17]: Are you saying that now his words have a laxative effect when it comes to opinions?

1883
02:25:29,335 --> 02:25:29,836
[SPEAKER_07]: Possibly.

1884
02:25:31,098 --> 02:25:31,398
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1885
02:25:32,098 --> 02:25:33,418
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to go to a break.

1886
02:25:33,959 --> 02:25:34,679
[SPEAKER_07]: No, actually, you know what?

1887
02:25:35,079 --> 02:25:36,859
[SPEAKER_07]: In all seriousness, I'm glad that song won.

1888
02:25:36,879 --> 02:25:40,200
[SPEAKER_07]: I just kind of, you know, I'm still kind of like, I don't know.

1889
02:25:40,500 --> 02:25:44,200
[SPEAKER_07]: But some people, when they voted for it, they actually said, I want to see a slow song on Orange Lounge.

1890
02:25:44,220 --> 02:25:45,581
[SPEAKER_17]: You did close the voting awfully early.

1891
02:25:46,101 --> 02:25:46,621
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, I did.

1892
02:25:46,821 --> 02:25:47,481
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm just a dick.

1893
02:25:47,621 --> 02:25:47,881
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1894
02:25:47,921 --> 02:25:48,961
[SPEAKER_17]: People didn't get theirs in.

1895
02:25:49,621 --> 02:25:52,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they need to wake up and get in on it.

1896
02:25:52,522 --> 02:25:53,402
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it would have been enough.

1897
02:25:53,562 --> 02:25:56,922
[SPEAKER_07]: We were several, several votes behind Jamie, so I don't think it would have been enough.

1898
02:25:57,723 --> 02:25:59,743
[SPEAKER_07]: When it's pretty clear one song's going to win...

1899
02:26:01,383 --> 02:26:03,145
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, anyway, let's go to a break.

1900
02:26:03,325 --> 02:26:09,931
[SPEAKER_07]: And in this break, I'm going to pick up kind of a lot of those leftover songs we haven't gotten to yet from DDR Extreme USA, including one of my favorites, Diving.

1901
02:26:10,511 --> 02:26:11,652
[SPEAKER_07]: I like that song by Four Strings.

1902
02:26:12,333 --> 02:26:14,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Like a Virgin and YMCA.

1903
02:26:14,475 --> 02:26:16,096
[SPEAKER_07]: We're also going to gay it up a little bit in this break.

1904
02:26:16,877 --> 02:26:19,980
[SPEAKER_15]: When we come back... Dude, I saw them perform that.

1905
02:26:21,161 --> 02:26:21,661
[SPEAKER_07]: That's hot.

1906
02:26:21,961 --> 02:26:22,822
[SPEAKER_15]: That was awesome.

1907
02:26:23,002 --> 02:26:25,424
[SPEAKER_07]: When we come back, the FUs of the week.

1908
02:26:25,825 --> 02:26:27,827
[SPEAKER_07]: You know it, you love it, and it's coming up.

1909
02:26:27,867 --> 02:26:28,287
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be back.

1910
02:26:54,379 --> 02:27:01,040
[SPEAKER_19]: So much that we should have done I was into Cuba Now I'm stuck Driving Knowing it was you I keep on trying

1911
02:27:55,976 --> 02:27:56,597
Thanks for watching!

1912
02:28:55,778 --> 02:28:56,304
Thank you.

1913
02:29:45,543 --> 02:30:13,270
[SPEAKER_22]: Young man, there's no need to feel down I said, young man, pick yourself up around I said, young man, cause you're in a new town There's no need to be unhappy Young man, there's a place you can go I said, young man, when you're short on your dough You can stay there, and I'm sure you won't find many ways to

1914
02:30:19,278 --> 02:30:32,426
[SPEAKER_19]: YMCA It's fun to stay at the YMCA Be a family with me So you'll need to enjoy You can hang out with all the boys It's fun to stay at the YMCA It's fun to stay at the YMCA

1915
02:30:46,235 --> 02:30:48,666
You can do whatever you feel

1916
02:31:17,392 --> 02:31:17,973
[SPEAKER_32]: and DarkSakura.com.

1917
02:31:32,119 --> 02:31:34,140
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up with that Village People song?

1918
02:31:34,260 --> 02:31:35,881
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it just me, or did it sound different?

1919
02:31:35,941 --> 02:31:38,383
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't sound like the same YMCA I remember.

1920
02:31:38,503 --> 02:31:41,044
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounded like they re-recorded it or something.

1921
02:31:41,064 --> 02:31:43,886
[SPEAKER_17]: You are not putting your nasty foot on the webcam.

1922
02:31:44,587 --> 02:31:49,469
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki is changing out the bandage on his foot right now, and he wants to put it on the webcam to scare you all with.

1923
02:31:49,590 --> 02:31:52,271
[SPEAKER_17]: Look at his Silent Hill, you know, toe.

1924
02:31:52,531 --> 02:31:54,653
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, how was it to play DDR with that foot?

1925
02:31:54,713 --> 02:31:55,393
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I want to know.

1926
02:31:56,414 --> 02:31:59,095
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, I see that NeverEnding Story thing on WinMX.

1927
02:31:59,115 --> 02:32:00,116
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to double-click it, okay?

1928
02:32:00,874 --> 02:32:01,514
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so excited.

1929
02:32:01,895 --> 02:32:03,516
[SPEAKER_07]: That echo image, never-ending story thing.

1930
02:32:03,536 --> 02:32:05,277
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope we get that by the end of the show so we can play it.

1931
02:32:05,437 --> 02:32:06,657
[SPEAKER_06]: That is nasty.

1932
02:32:06,897 --> 02:32:07,178
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

1933
02:32:07,578 --> 02:32:09,299
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't believe you're putting that on cam.

1934
02:32:09,359 --> 02:32:10,459
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so gross.

1935
02:32:12,601 --> 02:32:13,461
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to type.

1936
02:32:13,541 --> 02:32:14,882
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't want to look at your ugly tongue.

1937
02:32:14,942 --> 02:32:15,282
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1938
02:32:15,802 --> 02:32:18,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, we've been playing a lot of EXUSA songs for you guys.

1939
02:32:18,964 --> 02:32:22,066
[SPEAKER_07]: I know a lot of you guys missed Maximizer a little bit earlier.

1940
02:32:22,106 --> 02:32:23,907
[SPEAKER_07]: You didn't get a chance to hear Maximizer.

1941
02:32:28,434 --> 02:32:29,475
[SPEAKER_07]: and that's all you're going to hear of it now.

1942
02:32:29,895 --> 02:32:38,602
[SPEAKER_07]: But don't forget, all these EXUSA songs are in rotation all week long now on Orange Lounge Radio in our 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

1943
02:32:38,922 --> 02:32:45,427
[SPEAKER_07]: Bomani Music and More program is on and all the Extreme USA songs are in there for your listening pleasure.

1944
02:32:45,888 --> 02:32:46,528
[SPEAKER_07]: We always update.

1945
02:32:46,548 --> 02:32:47,889
[SPEAKER_07]: We like to stay up to date for you guys.

1946
02:32:48,810 --> 02:32:50,451
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll be putting other new songs in.

1947
02:32:50,491 --> 02:32:51,812
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't wait for Ultramix 2 to come out.

1948
02:32:51,832 --> 02:32:52,933
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to have field day with that one.

1949
02:32:54,174 --> 02:32:57,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, on our station on Monday nights, tune in for Diversion

1950
02:32:58,839 --> 02:33:02,302
[SPEAKER_07]: Your favorite fan-made and official Bomani remix songs.

1951
02:33:02,382 --> 02:33:03,083
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really good.

1952
02:33:03,123 --> 02:33:05,024
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of industrial-sounding songs in there and stuff.

1953
02:33:05,345 --> 02:33:06,245
[SPEAKER_07]: Really good remixes.

1954
02:33:06,345 --> 02:33:07,326
[SPEAKER_07]: Tune in if you haven't yet.

1955
02:33:07,887 --> 02:33:09,608
[SPEAKER_07]: 7 o'clock Pacific Time on Monday night.

1956
02:33:09,688 --> 02:33:12,450
[SPEAKER_17]: And then Tuesday nights... That would be where I step in.

1957
02:33:13,371 --> 02:33:15,973
[SPEAKER_17]: That's Pump Up the Volume on Orange Sound Radio.

1958
02:33:16,613 --> 02:33:22,118
[SPEAKER_17]: It's where I'm basically supposed to play people's requests, except nobody ever requests things anymore.

1959
02:33:23,226 --> 02:33:24,867
[SPEAKER_17]: So I just play whatever the hell I feel like.

1960
02:33:24,947 --> 02:33:27,707
[SPEAKER_17]: Usually I'll play a whole CD or marathon stuff.

1961
02:33:27,807 --> 02:33:34,389
[SPEAKER_17]: I was so completely impromptu last week, I just decided to play Dressed to Kill Again, the Eddie Izzard routine.

1962
02:33:36,250 --> 02:33:41,472
[SPEAKER_17]: Pre-show starts at 7 o'clock, or sometimes at a quarter till 7 if I'm bored.

1963
02:33:42,112 --> 02:33:48,734
[SPEAKER_17]: And then the show starts at 7.30 to 10.30, and if I'm bored I go longer if I lose track of time or if I forget to go to bed.

1964
02:33:49,294 --> 02:33:51,235
[SPEAKER_17]: So I play everything.

1965
02:33:51,255 --> 02:33:52,435
[SPEAKER_17]: I play everything from...

1966
02:33:53,473 --> 02:33:54,654
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's see, what did I play last week?

1967
02:33:54,694 --> 02:34:00,058
[SPEAKER_17]: I played the DDR EX V-Rare 3 CD.

1968
02:34:00,879 --> 02:34:04,621
[SPEAKER_17]: I played some comedy.

1969
02:34:04,762 --> 02:34:09,045
[SPEAKER_17]: I played, you know, some Metallica.

1970
02:34:09,165 --> 02:34:09,985
[SPEAKER_17]: I just play everything.

1971
02:34:10,046 --> 02:34:14,949
[SPEAKER_17]: So, since I've got a pretty, you know, diverse sense of taste for music.

1972
02:34:16,711 --> 02:34:16,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1973
02:34:17,171 --> 02:34:17,791
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a good time.

1974
02:34:18,072 --> 02:34:18,452
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, listen.

1975
02:34:18,472 --> 02:34:18,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Listen.

1976
02:34:19,171 --> 02:34:21,732
[SPEAKER_07]: Wednesday nights, 7 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.

1977
02:34:22,152 --> 02:34:32,555
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be back this Wednesday after a little bit of a hiatus, but Rice Princess, LankyStyle, and myself, we bring you a little show called Outside the Box, which is a show dedicated to video gaming.

1978
02:34:32,995 --> 02:34:38,216
[SPEAKER_07]: The other games, besides that DDR and foot stomping and beat hitting games.

1979
02:34:38,604 --> 02:34:39,704
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1980
02:35:07,589 --> 02:35:11,310
[SPEAKER_07]: Why is it for 113 weeks in a row now we have to do the FUs of the week?

1981
02:35:12,090 --> 02:35:16,051
[SPEAKER_17]: Because I'm still full of angst and I can't make it stop.

1982
02:35:31,755 --> 02:35:34,636
[SPEAKER_17]: I would like to give a big FU to the majority of the human race.

1983
02:35:36,808 --> 02:35:38,049
[SPEAKER_17]: For one very big reason.

1984
02:35:38,609 --> 02:35:43,612
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a stupid moron who ran out in front of my car on Madison Avenue while I'm going 60.

1985
02:35:43,892 --> 02:35:50,055
[SPEAKER_17]: I would have hit him had he continued.

1986
02:35:50,695 --> 02:35:54,597
[SPEAKER_17]: Asshole decides that he's... Oh, there's a Tercel heading to me.

1987
02:35:54,977 --> 02:35:56,598
[SPEAKER_17]: And so he jumps out back into the lane.

1988
02:35:57,038 --> 02:36:00,800
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm just like, looking... I managed to slow down enough.

1989
02:36:00,840 --> 02:36:03,181
[SPEAKER_17]: I was going about 20 where I got where he would have been.

1990
02:36:03,501 --> 02:36:04,502
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm just looking at this guy like,

1991
02:36:05,143 --> 02:36:06,704
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh my god, what planet are you from?

1992
02:36:06,724 --> 02:36:11,328
[SPEAKER_17]: Are you from the planet of, like, perpetually flat people, you know, because they all get run over by cars?

1993
02:36:12,609 --> 02:36:13,710
[SPEAKER_17]: You stupid fucker.

1994
02:36:13,750 --> 02:36:20,115
[SPEAKER_17]: And then there's, like, the guy on the motorcycle who, like, decides that he's going to speed up when I'm trying to change lanes.

1995
02:36:20,135 --> 02:36:27,921
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm halfway into the goddamn lane, and then he blows... Oh, what... I just... Yeah, I was going 60 on Madison.

1996
02:36:27,981 --> 02:36:29,603
[SPEAKER_17]: I usually go 60 on Madison.

1997
02:36:30,043 --> 02:36:32,245
[SPEAKER_17]: It was in the 50s, and it was only 10 miles over.

1998
02:36:34,532 --> 02:36:35,692
[SPEAKER_17]: Don't, oh my god, me?

1999
02:36:36,613 --> 02:36:37,133
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, anyway.

2000
02:36:38,833 --> 02:36:55,616
[SPEAKER_17]: So, uh, I was, uh, there's also, like, this old lady who was in front of the line, um, at, uh, um, the grocery store, who decided that she was gonna be the slowest person ever.

2001
02:36:56,016 --> 02:36:57,236
[SPEAKER_17]: This is in the express lane.

2002
02:36:57,676 --> 02:37:00,997
[SPEAKER_17]: They finally get out of the lane, and then they change cashiers and start counting out the door.

2003
02:37:01,017 --> 02:37:02,017
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm like, what?

2004
02:37:02,057 --> 02:37:02,317
[SPEAKER_17]: What?

2005
02:37:03,030 --> 02:37:28,162
[SPEAKER_17]: and then like a big actually goes to all that Chinese food and all like the carby food I've been eating all weekend because I decided that I was gonna gonna cheat like mad all weekend and I have and now my stomach hurts but I had coconut cream pie this weekend and that makes it all right and I want to go have a beer I had coconut cream pie when I was on the east coast it was very good it was at a little truck stop style diner too I went to the Hofbrau

2006
02:37:29,031 --> 02:37:29,992
[SPEAKER_17]: Huffbrow!

2007
02:37:30,492 --> 02:37:31,473
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't call it the Huffbrow.

2008
02:37:31,493 --> 02:37:32,394
[SPEAKER_07]: The Huffbrow!

2009
02:37:32,474 --> 02:37:33,134
[SPEAKER_17]: Huffbrow!

2010
02:37:34,556 --> 02:37:36,998
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially in a town where Arnold Schwarzenegger is governor.

2011
02:37:37,038 --> 02:37:37,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on.

2012
02:37:37,898 --> 02:37:38,999
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the Huffbrow!

2013
02:37:41,401 --> 02:37:47,106
[SPEAKER_17]: And F you to the situation where people say, Oh sure, we'll call you when we're ready to eat.

2014
02:37:47,206 --> 02:37:49,208
[SPEAKER_17]: And then they go out to eat already.

2015
02:37:49,568 --> 02:37:49,788
[SPEAKER_17]: And then...

2016
02:37:53,234 --> 02:38:05,565
[SPEAKER_17]: An F you goes toward a friend's parent for saying something, for completely making an assumption about something that my fiance had said and for just going off on them with no reason.

2017
02:38:05,765 --> 02:38:11,650
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, first of all, when you assume it makes an ass out of you and me, okay?

2018
02:38:12,531 --> 02:38:15,693
[SPEAKER_17]: You learn this when you're in middle school, okay?

2019
02:38:15,974 --> 02:38:16,234
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay?

2020
02:38:16,880 --> 02:38:23,465
[SPEAKER_17]: And then another F you goes to all the people who drive like huge luxury sedans and SUVs who park in compact places.

2021
02:38:24,386 --> 02:38:25,767
[SPEAKER_17]: Your car is not little.

2022
02:38:26,187 --> 02:38:29,310
[SPEAKER_17]: And also learn how to fucking stay in the lines, okay?

2023
02:38:29,330 --> 02:38:35,735
[SPEAKER_17]: If you're gonna park your car there, if there's nowhere else to do it, at least keep your car between the lines so that other people can park.

2024
02:38:37,436 --> 02:38:41,540
[SPEAKER_17]: I used to go around to people who did that at school and pour honey on their driver's side door.

2025
02:38:42,560 --> 02:38:43,161
[SPEAKER_17]: On the handle.

2026
02:38:43,601 --> 02:38:44,422
[SPEAKER_17]: In the middle of summer.

2027
02:38:44,909 --> 02:38:45,649
[SPEAKER_05]: You're so mature.

2028
02:38:45,829 --> 02:38:50,651
[SPEAKER_17]: And I would go back and check the handle when I was leaving, and there would be flies on it, and it would be awesome.

2029
02:38:52,571 --> 02:38:54,892
[SPEAKER_17]: This was, you know, when I was first in school.

2030
02:38:55,592 --> 02:39:00,214
[SPEAKER_17]: But, it's like, these are the people that I leave notes on their car now.

2031
02:39:01,194 --> 02:39:08,717
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, the other day, I left a diagram on how to properly park the car on the top of this SUV.

2032
02:39:09,077 --> 02:39:12,638
[SPEAKER_17]: Also, another F you goes toward the H, too, for looking stupid.

2033
02:39:13,726 --> 02:39:15,087
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, what was wrong with the Hummer?

2034
02:39:15,567 --> 02:39:16,447
[SPEAKER_17]: Rob, what was wrong with the Hummer?

2035
02:39:16,467 --> 02:39:16,767
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you know?

2036
02:39:17,608 --> 02:39:18,148
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, everything.

2037
02:39:18,488 --> 02:39:19,028
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just kidding.

2038
02:39:19,808 --> 02:39:21,129
[SPEAKER_17]: They look cool.

2039
02:39:21,589 --> 02:39:22,850
[SPEAKER_17]: They were tough.

2040
02:39:23,170 --> 02:39:27,211
[SPEAKER_17]: And now they're all like, hi, we're going to look completely suburban.

2041
02:39:27,371 --> 02:39:29,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Aren't those those square cars, the Hummers?

2042
02:39:29,432 --> 02:39:30,232
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, they were awesome.

2043
02:39:30,693 --> 02:39:31,453
[SPEAKER_06]: They're square!

2044
02:39:31,833 --> 02:39:32,513
[SPEAKER_17]: They're cool!

2045
02:39:33,974 --> 02:39:35,014
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, whatever.

2046
02:39:35,435 --> 02:39:38,156
[SPEAKER_17]: And I want to put a rocket launcher on one and drive it to work.

2047
02:39:39,856 --> 02:39:41,657
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's just...

2048
02:39:42,751 --> 02:39:44,032
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, I've got the inked scalp.

2049
02:39:44,072 --> 02:39:46,713
[SPEAKER_17]: That's really my major B. Alright.

2050
02:39:47,473 --> 02:39:47,733
[SPEAKER_07]: You sure?

2051
02:39:47,773 --> 02:39:48,873
[SPEAKER_17]: I should have ran over that guy.

2052
02:39:49,294 --> 02:39:49,434
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

2053
02:39:49,754 --> 02:39:50,654
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think you should have too.

2054
02:39:50,714 --> 02:39:51,334
[SPEAKER_07]: Teach him a lesson.

2055
02:39:51,494 --> 02:39:52,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Darwinizen.

2056
02:39:52,195 --> 02:39:54,556
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let's move on to, uh, Loki!

2057
02:39:57,577 --> 02:39:59,157
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to say that I can't be that bad.

2058
02:39:59,297 --> 02:39:59,858
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell?

2059
02:40:00,338 --> 02:40:03,039
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, my first time using those erupt chairs is, um, okay, there we go.

2060
02:40:03,399 --> 02:40:03,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that was easy.

2061
02:40:04,379 --> 02:40:10,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, uh, actually, I'm not that mad right now because I just noticed I'm getting a whole lot of new echo images and that makes me happy.

2062
02:40:11,309 --> 02:40:13,970
[SPEAKER_04]: But my main FU goes to my toe, because it hurts bad.

2063
02:40:14,210 --> 02:40:22,311
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it doesn't, it's just, it hurts more with the, like, where they poke the needle in, because it's actually bruised, and if you touch it, it's really tender, and it's like, ugh.

2064
02:40:22,851 --> 02:40:27,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, my toe looks really nasty, and it burns every now and then, so that's kind of bad.

2065
02:40:28,132 --> 02:40:31,933
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, I should just have gone to the doctor earlier, and we wouldn't have this problem.

2066
02:40:32,453 --> 02:40:35,093
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's, you know, a rule for everybody.

2067
02:40:35,113 --> 02:40:39,354
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have a problem, don't wait it out, because you don't know

2068
02:40:39,997 --> 02:40:41,218
[SPEAKER_04]: The doctor knows better than you do.

2069
02:40:41,478 --> 02:40:45,139
[SPEAKER_04]: So just go to the doctor, take care of... And that's it.

2070
02:40:45,539 --> 02:40:52,682
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um... OtherFU goes to Paranoia Eternal on hand-to-feet mode for breaking my lamp.

2071
02:40:53,002 --> 02:40:57,704
[SPEAKER_04]: That wasn't my fault, that was purely DDR Extreme's fault for breaking the lamp.

2072
02:40:59,225 --> 02:41:03,487
[SPEAKER_04]: And... Finally, um... I don't know.

2073
02:41:03,687 --> 02:41:05,087
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty much all I've got.

2074
02:41:05,268 --> 02:41:06,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, um... Oh, yeah.

2075
02:41:06,748 --> 02:41:08,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck you to goddamn...

2076
02:41:09,856 --> 02:41:15,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Jack in the Box for being fucking slow because they burned the stupid chicken tenders.

2077
02:41:16,460 --> 02:41:16,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Stupid.

2078
02:41:18,841 --> 02:41:19,502
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's all.

2079
02:41:20,282 --> 02:41:20,602
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm done.

2080
02:41:28,721 --> 02:41:42,223
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to myself for not taking Monday off of work because after leaving on a two week trip I really should have taken the next couple days off so I could just relax and catch up with everything I missed but F you to being gone so long because I missed everybody and it was sad but I'm back now and everything's better

2081
02:41:42,805 --> 02:41:44,506
[SPEAKER_17]: We missed you too, but our aim's improving.

2082
02:41:44,687 --> 02:41:45,627
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, you're trying.

2083
02:41:46,928 --> 02:41:50,931
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to the mall where the DDR pad was broken.

2084
02:41:50,991 --> 02:41:51,712
[SPEAKER_07]: That kind of pissed me off.

2085
02:41:51,732 --> 02:41:56,416
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to the same jack-in-the-box because that was my chicken tenders they burned and I had to go back and do.

2086
02:41:56,516 --> 02:41:58,978
[SPEAKER_07]: And they could have, you know, given us an update or something, but whatever.

2087
02:42:00,879 --> 02:42:07,384
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to all these video games coming out all at once that I want to buy and I'm not having, like, enough money to buy them all.

2088
02:42:07,444 --> 02:42:08,465
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, I'll live.

2089
02:42:09,185 --> 02:42:09,326
[SPEAKER_07]: And...

2090
02:42:11,252 --> 02:42:12,093
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess that's really it.

2091
02:42:12,513 --> 02:42:13,534
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have a whole lot of angst.

2092
02:42:13,574 --> 02:42:14,095
[SPEAKER_07]: I never do.

2093
02:42:14,815 --> 02:42:15,856
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a nice person.

2094
02:42:17,078 --> 02:42:22,703
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, maybe not, but I'm just... I'm not feeling very creative tonight, so... Oh, I thought of one.

2095
02:42:23,484 --> 02:42:29,649
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to the fact that my flight got delayed leaving from Phoenix into California, into Sacramento, because...

2096
02:42:30,618 --> 02:42:34,321
[SPEAKER_07]: We all get on the plane and we're all sitting there and it's a full flight and it's just all packed.

2097
02:42:35,281 --> 02:42:38,263
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't like all those people being so close to all those people to begin with.

2098
02:42:38,683 --> 02:42:45,308
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially when you're sitting next to somebody whose arm is all up in the armrest and it feels like they're invading your personal space and stuff.

2099
02:42:46,048 --> 02:42:46,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, I don't like that.

2100
02:42:48,450 --> 02:42:52,092
[SPEAKER_07]: And then being told that, oh, we're missing a part.

2101
02:42:52,172 --> 02:42:54,154
[SPEAKER_07]: We have to go change a part on the plane.

2102
02:42:54,274 --> 02:42:56,675
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we're stuck there for like 20 minutes while they change a part.

2103
02:42:56,695 --> 02:42:57,656
[SPEAKER_24]: Sigh.

2104
02:42:59,609 --> 02:43:02,831
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's get to some other FUs in studio.

2105
02:43:02,891 --> 02:43:03,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's start off.

2106
02:43:03,711 --> 02:43:04,651
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's got a microphone?

2107
02:43:06,012 --> 02:43:06,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody's got to have one.

2108
02:43:07,052 --> 02:43:07,572
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, God.

2109
02:43:07,612 --> 02:43:08,153
[SPEAKER_07]: Here he comes.

2110
02:43:08,233 --> 02:43:11,254
[SPEAKER_17]: Jonas with his FUs of the week.

2111
02:43:12,794 --> 02:43:14,915
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll keep it as fast as possible.

2112
02:43:16,055 --> 02:43:16,456
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

2113
02:43:17,256 --> 02:43:21,878
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to give an FU to work for not giving me some free time.

2114
02:43:21,918 --> 02:43:23,498
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to spend some time with my family.

2115
02:43:23,538 --> 02:43:26,579
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't keep getting five days a week.

2116
02:43:29,781 --> 02:43:30,982
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, I have school as well.

2117
02:43:31,002 --> 02:43:32,562
[SPEAKER_17]: Some of us work and go to school.

2118
02:43:33,583 --> 02:43:35,383
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that, but I have to take care of family as well.

2119
02:43:35,423 --> 02:43:37,164
[SPEAKER_01]: I gotta move, because I'm moving somewhere.

2120
02:43:37,244 --> 02:43:39,025
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm moving to another house.

2121
02:43:41,586 --> 02:43:41,906
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

2122
02:43:43,006 --> 02:43:49,989
[SPEAKER_01]: F you to... F you to some asshole after buying my car for...

2123
02:43:51,536 --> 02:44:11,017
[SPEAKER_01]: some asshole after borrowing a car for without my permission to actually change the fluids of the inside like you don't put fucking engine oil on to where the coolant is supposed to be at that ain't fucking cool my car fucked up there

2124
02:44:13,553 --> 02:44:17,575
[SPEAKER_01]: And FU for not being able to play DDR Extreme for the PS2.

2125
02:44:17,895 --> 02:44:19,716
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hearing some pretty good reviews towards it.

2126
02:44:20,736 --> 02:44:24,638
[SPEAKER_01]: FU for maximize your steps to being sucky as hell.

2127
02:44:27,059 --> 02:44:30,321
[SPEAKER_01]: FU to RVGL for not fixing their goddamn pads.

2128
02:44:30,361 --> 02:44:32,562
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to try that EX2, I wasted a dollar for nothing.

2129
02:44:33,942 --> 02:44:35,423
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to mention some extra gas money.

2130
02:44:38,516 --> 02:44:41,557
[SPEAKER_01]: FU to someone throwing tacks on the road.

2131
02:44:42,037 --> 02:44:42,777
[SPEAKER_01]: God dammit.

2132
02:44:44,698 --> 02:44:49,720
[SPEAKER_01]: And people, people, people don't know what to do, when to quit.

2133
02:44:50,120 --> 02:44:53,661
[SPEAKER_01]: So you think you're gonna throw a bunch of tacks on the road and say, ha ha ha.

2134
02:44:56,242 --> 02:45:01,963
[SPEAKER_01]: And FU for double parking in the school area.

2135
02:45:02,484 --> 02:45:06,825
[SPEAKER_01]: God dammit, we all have to park as well, not just one car hogging two lanes.

2136
02:45:08,533 --> 02:45:12,414
[SPEAKER_01]: And thanks to that, I actually failed the damn midterm because of that.

2137
02:45:13,034 --> 02:45:14,514
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I was 30 minutes late with class.

2138
02:45:16,575 --> 02:45:20,455
[SPEAKER_01]: And since I have to keep the FU shorts, might as well give it to someone else.

2139
02:45:20,775 --> 02:45:21,156
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2140
02:45:21,636 --> 02:45:22,276
[SPEAKER_01]: Bradley.

2141
02:45:23,096 --> 02:45:23,956
[SPEAKER_07]: Bradley, your FU's.

2142
02:45:25,196 --> 02:45:25,576
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2143
02:45:26,297 --> 02:45:26,837
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

2144
02:45:27,677 --> 02:45:29,477
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck you to politics as usual.

2145
02:45:31,638 --> 02:45:37,499
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuck you to lazy dumb shits in parking lots who leave their...

2146
02:45:38,618 --> 02:45:44,760
[SPEAKER_11]: Grocery stores that leave their fucking grocery carts out in the middle of the spaces.

2147
02:45:45,440 --> 02:45:51,802
[SPEAKER_11]: So fucking annoying, you can come up to a space and be like, oh, I can go park here, oh no, the dumb shit put the fucking carts in the middle of the space.

2148
02:45:53,103 --> 02:45:57,684
[SPEAKER_11]: If you put it up in one of the meaty little things and it's not in the way, that's okay.

2149
02:45:58,404 --> 02:46:06,387
[SPEAKER_11]: It's still annoying and you're a lazy ass for not taking it to the receptacle or back to the store, but if it's in the way, it's a bitch.

2150
02:46:06,917 --> 02:46:08,638
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, let's see, what else?

2151
02:46:11,159 --> 02:46:14,600
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuck you to being lazy after work and not really getting much done.

2152
02:46:16,841 --> 02:46:27,365
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'll give a fuck you to dial-up for being slow, and that being part of the reason it takes forever to go read LiveJournal and check up on everything.

2153
02:46:29,966 --> 02:46:30,446
[SPEAKER_11]: That's about it.

2154
02:46:31,386 --> 02:46:32,747
[SPEAKER_07]: DDR Angel, your FUs of the week.

2155
02:46:37,386 --> 02:46:44,188
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't really have that many FUs this week.

2156
02:46:46,669 --> 02:46:53,851
[SPEAKER_13]: I was getting all excited about Final Fantasy XI until Andrew just text messaged me and said my video card might not like it.

2157
02:46:54,051 --> 02:46:54,891
[SPEAKER_13]: So FU to that.

2158
02:46:55,592 --> 02:46:56,652
[SPEAKER_13]: But maybe we'll get that fixed.

2159
02:46:58,559 --> 02:47:00,962
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that's me.

2160
02:47:01,042 --> 02:47:02,724
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, maybe the benchmark will fix it.

2161
02:47:02,804 --> 02:47:03,184
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

2162
02:47:05,367 --> 02:47:06,168
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yeah, the benchmark.

2163
02:47:06,208 --> 02:47:06,829
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yeah, we have that.

2164
02:47:06,849 --> 02:47:07,289
[SPEAKER_13]: Never mind.

2165
02:47:07,309 --> 02:47:09,111
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I've heeded that.

2166
02:47:09,211 --> 02:47:13,496
[SPEAKER_13]: I hope to get that fixed tomorrow so I can play with the rest of the group.

2167
02:47:14,317 --> 02:47:15,018
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess that's it.

2168
02:47:15,078 --> 02:47:17,221
[SPEAKER_13]: There's not really that much to... Oh, yeah, and I've heeded my...

2169
02:47:19,188 --> 02:47:26,137
[SPEAKER_13]: My computer science teacher for getting our webpage project that was due like Friday.

2170
02:47:26,198 --> 02:47:29,422
[SPEAKER_13]: He's like, oh, okay, hold the screen on Monday so you guys can do your presentation.

2171
02:47:29,442 --> 02:47:32,266
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, dork, you're the one that said you were going to bring it in on Wednesday.

2172
02:47:32,446 --> 02:47:33,007
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, whatever.

2173
02:47:33,027 --> 02:47:34,809
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that's it.

2174
02:47:36,578 --> 02:47:37,879
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's get to our chatroom FUs.

2175
02:47:37,899 --> 02:47:39,119
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got to make this quick tonight.

2176
02:47:39,199 --> 02:47:41,820
[SPEAKER_07]: If you sent a bunch, they're getting cut, just to warn you.

2177
02:47:42,280 --> 02:47:46,462
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkLion, FU to myself for giving Sky the song Regulus over the Clouds mix.

2178
02:47:46,502 --> 02:47:48,803
[SPEAKER_07]: I told you not to play it while I was in San Francisco two weeks ago.

2179
02:47:48,943 --> 02:47:49,763
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry!

2180
02:47:50,844 --> 02:47:51,264
[SPEAKER_07]: It was fun.

2181
02:47:52,845 --> 02:47:56,546
[SPEAKER_07]: FU to JTap for being one of the most boring anime conventions I've ever attended.

2182
02:47:56,586 --> 02:48:02,308
[SPEAKER_07]: My only complaint is that I didn't get to hang around with friends I haven't seen for a long time, even though I was staffing in the video department.

2183
02:48:02,989 --> 02:48:03,629
[SPEAKER_07]: Wish I could have gone.

2184
02:48:04,827 --> 02:48:06,087
[SPEAKER_07]: Something came up and I couldn't go.

2185
02:48:06,147 --> 02:48:07,008
[SPEAKER_07]: I was originally planning.

2186
02:48:09,108 --> 02:48:11,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Dark Knight says, My FU is one of extraordinary magnitude.

2187
02:48:11,989 --> 02:48:15,890
[SPEAKER_07]: FU to the local putt-putt in my hometown for taking away the only 2DX machine in Richmond.

2188
02:48:16,191 --> 02:48:18,871
[SPEAKER_07]: It's now the only Beatmania we have now as second mix complete.

2189
02:48:18,951 --> 02:48:19,392
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn them.

2190
02:48:19,532 --> 02:48:21,512
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn them all to Haiti.

2191
02:48:23,773 --> 02:48:32,676
[SPEAKER_07]: Mandarin says, FU to dumb Costco customers who don't know how to put perishable shit back where it belongs, but instead put some frozen hamburger patties on the same aisle as aspirin.

2192
02:48:33,156 --> 02:48:33,376
Hahaha.

2193
02:48:37,881 --> 02:48:42,285
[SPEAKER_07]: Shade23 says, F you to my headset for being missing so I can't defend in the groove.

2194
02:48:42,346 --> 02:48:43,587
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, I said good things about it.

2195
02:48:44,348 --> 02:48:45,589
[SPEAKER_07]: I said bad things about it too.

2196
02:48:46,490 --> 02:48:49,893
[SPEAKER_07]: Johnfield said, F you to spilling soda all over myself at dinner.

2197
02:48:50,093 --> 02:48:51,595
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to not enough hours in the day.

2198
02:48:52,115 --> 02:48:56,780
[SPEAKER_07]: F you for not being able to go to Tokyo Game Show and get PSM exclusive footage.

2199
02:48:58,769 --> 02:49:01,571
[SPEAKER_07]: Sid says F you to Utah for being a Bomani wasteland.

2200
02:49:01,671 --> 02:49:05,134
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to my hands for failing get on beat wild style every time that I play it.

2201
02:49:05,274 --> 02:49:08,276
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to the samurai of the world for the suppression of the ninja clans.

2202
02:49:08,997 --> 02:49:09,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Are they still around?

2203
02:49:09,798 --> 02:49:10,098
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

2204
02:49:10,758 --> 02:49:13,480
[SPEAKER_07]: And F you to my body for waking me up at 5 a.m.

2205
02:49:13,541 --> 02:49:14,842
[SPEAKER_07]: every day when I really need to get up at 7.

2206
02:49:14,962 --> 02:49:21,947
[SPEAKER_07]: Siegert says F you to the whiny ass DDR freak people who complain that Extreme US is crappy because it doesn't cater their wants.

2207
02:49:22,367 --> 02:49:22,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Get over it.

2208
02:49:23,348 --> 02:49:26,931
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to those same people who blame Konami of America for EXUS's faults.

2209
02:49:27,441 --> 02:49:29,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Try blaming the right company for once.

2210
02:49:29,425 --> 02:49:29,625
[SPEAKER_30]: Oh!

2211
02:49:30,207 --> 02:49:32,812
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to having Job ADD in Final Fantasy XI.

2212
02:49:32,852 --> 02:49:36,178
[SPEAKER_07]: And finally, F you to the DS only coming out in the silver-black color.

2213
02:49:36,599 --> 02:49:37,822
[SPEAKER_07]: I want some sort of blue.

2214
02:49:38,262 --> 02:49:38,743
[SPEAKER_07]: Just wait.

2215
02:49:38,884 --> 02:49:39,485
[SPEAKER_07]: Pokemon Blue.

2216
02:49:41,502 --> 02:49:46,786
[SPEAKER_07]: Zaku says, F you to having to spend the better part of Friday cleaning out the shit called spyware, addaware from my computer.

2217
02:49:47,226 --> 02:49:57,653
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to Fox News Live for basically making DDR Freak Mod Frequency look like a fool when she asked him that she thought she was going to interview a nine-year-old and making DDR look like a fad instead of a serious weight loss tool.

2218
02:49:57,673 --> 02:49:58,573
[SPEAKER_07]: We're actually going to get to that.

2219
02:49:58,593 --> 02:50:01,395
[SPEAKER_07]: We have like five minutes left in show, but I want to get to that.

2220
02:50:01,515 --> 02:50:10,321
[SPEAKER_07]: Rychan says, F you to all the American brats acting like Festival was made for them so they have every right to bitch about the preliminary song list.

2221
02:50:10,361 --> 02:50:11,322
[SPEAKER_07]: Another thing we didn't even get to.

2222
02:50:11,875 --> 02:50:14,977
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to our arcade manager for not doing anything to take care of our machine.

2223
02:50:14,997 --> 02:50:19,460
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to Konami Style for not making it easier to get a hold of the 2DX8 style limited edition.

2224
02:50:22,002 --> 02:50:27,525
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, DDArcoholic, uh, F you to my emerging pot belly.

2225
02:50:27,926 --> 02:50:30,888
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to my old CD burner for deciding it doesn't want to burn discs anymore.

2226
02:50:30,948 --> 02:50:33,289
[SPEAKER_07]: So I replaced your stupid head with a new DVD burner.

2227
02:50:33,329 --> 02:50:33,549
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay.

2228
02:50:33,890 --> 02:50:35,611
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob, your new icon has a penis in it.

2229
02:50:35,671 --> 02:50:36,251
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it doesn't.

2230
02:50:36,431 --> 02:50:37,852
[SPEAKER_07]: I did not put a penis in the icon.

2231
02:50:37,872 --> 02:50:38,953
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys are just seeing things.

2232
02:50:39,867 --> 02:50:45,971
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and F you to this insane beeping sound that keeps going off somewhere in my apartment complex every five minutes and has been doing so for several days now.

2233
02:50:46,411 --> 02:50:52,135
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe longer because I only just recently noticed it and now it's fucking annoying because it goes beep, beep, beep every five freaking minutes every day.

2234
02:50:52,435 --> 02:50:52,555
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah.

2235
02:50:53,435 --> 02:50:57,958
[SPEAKER_07]: Lastly, Nince says, F you to myself for picking a hard to find topic for my research paper.

2236
02:50:57,978 --> 02:50:59,319
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to my boss.

2237
02:50:59,659 --> 02:51:04,342
[SPEAKER_07]: She has this wonderful idea if someone only works for two or three days a week, no matter how many hours they work in those days,

2238
02:51:04,755 --> 02:51:06,836
[SPEAKER_07]: She doesn't pay you that week and rolls it in the next week.

2239
02:51:07,156 --> 02:51:08,877
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to school now and can't work that much.

2240
02:51:09,398 --> 02:51:10,618
[SPEAKER_07]: I need my damn money now.

2241
02:51:11,179 --> 02:51:14,680
[SPEAKER_07]: And F you to the creepy guy that was following my friends and I at the movie theater last night.

2242
02:51:14,720 --> 02:51:18,743
[SPEAKER_07]: Later found out from her friend working there that he had been there for hours talking to random people.

2243
02:51:19,503 --> 02:51:22,585
[SPEAKER_07]: And he says he should have that Echo Image Neverending Story remix in five minutes.

2244
02:51:22,845 --> 02:51:24,146
[SPEAKER_07]: So pass that along to us.

2245
02:51:24,226 --> 02:51:24,806
[SPEAKER_07]: We want it too.

2246
02:51:29,609 --> 02:51:30,089
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2247
02:51:30,409 --> 02:51:32,070
[SPEAKER_07]: We're done with the F yous.

2248
02:51:33,633 --> 02:51:36,255
[SPEAKER_07]: One more kind of big story this week we've got to get to.

2249
02:51:38,576 --> 02:51:44,600
[SPEAKER_07]: DDR made an appearance on Fair and Balanced, ha ha ha, Fox News this week.

2250
02:51:44,920 --> 02:51:52,285
[SPEAKER_07]: And we actually got a picture, not a picture, I'm sorry, the clip of the interview here.

2251
02:51:52,505 --> 02:51:53,586
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually haven't even watched this.

2252
02:51:53,606 --> 02:51:57,369
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I watched it when it was live on air, but I haven't even seen this other little clip of it yet.

2253
02:51:57,969 --> 02:51:59,010
[SPEAKER_07]: It says it's 25 minutes.

2254
02:51:59,050 --> 02:51:59,610
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't be right.

2255
02:52:00,231 --> 02:52:00,671
[SPEAKER_07]: There we go.

2256
02:52:00,711 --> 02:52:01,291
[SPEAKER_07]: That's more like it.

2257
02:52:01,331 --> 02:52:02,392
[SPEAKER_07]: It's only about three minutes.

2258
02:52:02,867 --> 02:52:03,848
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's check this out.

2259
02:52:03,908 --> 02:52:12,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Here is a little interview, and we're going to do, of course, in typical Orange Lounge fashion, we will butt in and make comments whenever we feel like it on the Fox News clip.

2260
02:52:12,352 --> 02:52:15,414
[SPEAKER_07]: So here it is, the audio version for those of you guys who didn't get a chance to hear it.

2261
02:52:19,376 --> 02:52:21,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, and the audio level is very shitty.

2262
02:52:21,997 --> 02:52:22,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me see what I can do about that.

2263
02:52:22,937 --> 02:52:24,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me see if I can open it up in another program.

2264
02:52:24,638 --> 02:52:25,319
[SPEAKER_07]: Give me a minute, you guys.

2265
02:52:25,339 --> 02:52:25,839
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry about that.

2266
02:52:26,919 --> 02:52:29,701
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what happens when you try to play something when you haven't really...

2267
02:52:30,191 --> 02:52:31,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Explore the file yet.

2268
02:52:31,132 --> 02:52:32,893
[SPEAKER_07]: If worse comes to worse, we can always save it for next week.

2269
02:52:33,633 --> 02:52:35,995
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see what I can do about turning up the volume here.

2270
02:52:36,115 --> 02:52:38,456
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go into this.

2271
02:52:38,596 --> 02:52:39,457
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's try it this way.

2272
02:52:41,418 --> 02:52:44,600
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't hear it!

2273
02:52:46,581 --> 02:52:47,542
[SPEAKER_07]: The audio sucks.

2274
02:52:49,042 --> 02:52:49,223
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah!

2275
02:52:50,363 --> 02:52:51,044
[SPEAKER_07]: The audio sucks.

2276
02:52:51,104 --> 02:52:51,884
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an MPEG.

2277
02:52:53,205 --> 02:52:55,306
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, Loki's going to try blasting it for you guys.

2278
02:52:55,526 --> 02:52:56,227
[SPEAKER_07]: It's on my desktop.

2279
02:52:56,247 --> 02:52:57,127
[SPEAKER_07]: You should be able to share it, right?

2280
02:52:59,269 --> 02:52:59,829
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on, hold on.

2281
02:53:02,008 --> 02:53:02,908
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me share the desktop.

2282
02:53:06,109 --> 02:53:06,729
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, shit.

2283
02:53:09,650 --> 02:53:10,950
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, can I copy it over to your network?

2284
02:53:11,910 --> 02:53:13,771
[SPEAKER_07]: We're having technical difficulties, everybody.

2285
02:53:15,791 --> 02:53:18,032
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, I'm going to try putting it on Loki's computer.

2286
02:53:18,052 --> 02:53:19,072
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to try one other thing here.

2287
02:53:20,152 --> 02:53:22,013
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what I get for trying to do things on the fly.

2288
02:53:22,073 --> 02:53:23,513
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, I'm going to drop it in right there.

2289
02:53:24,714 --> 02:53:25,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see that.

2290
02:53:27,814 --> 02:53:28,575
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, here we go.

2291
02:53:29,075 --> 02:53:29,715
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki's got it.

2292
02:53:29,755 --> 02:53:30,375
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to try to

2293
02:53:32,039 --> 02:53:32,219
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

2294
02:53:32,239 --> 02:53:34,100
[SPEAKER_07]: Pause it, pause it, pause it.

2295
02:53:34,120 --> 02:53:35,702
[SPEAKER_26]: Obviously they did their research there.

2296
02:53:35,722 --> 02:53:37,303
[SPEAKER_26]: The member of the DDR Freaks.

2297
02:53:37,343 --> 02:53:40,625
[SPEAKER_26]: Did you know that you're a moderator on DDR Freaks?

2298
02:53:40,645 --> 02:53:42,146
[SPEAKER_26]: That woman is a moron.

2299
02:54:01,946 --> 02:54:03,066
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, start it up again.

2300
02:54:05,127 --> 02:54:07,948
[SPEAKER_26]: Jason, first, why don't you explain to me what DDR is?

2301
02:54:09,408 --> 02:54:17,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Dance Dance Revolution is an interactive video game that combines physical activity with energetic dance music.

2302
02:54:18,371 --> 02:54:26,173
[SPEAKER_02]: It allows you to actually drop your controllers and get up on a dance floor and actually move to the groove.

2303
02:54:26,473 --> 02:54:29,194
[SPEAKER_26]: This is not that much different than Twister without the music, no?

2304
02:54:30,675 --> 02:54:33,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, a lot of people have said it's like karaoke for your feet.

2305
02:54:34,858 --> 02:54:35,878
[SPEAKER_07]: Pause it, pause it, pause it.

2306
02:54:35,959 --> 02:54:38,580
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know anyone that's ever called it karaoke for your feet.

2307
02:54:38,620 --> 02:54:40,341
[SPEAKER_07]: Has anyone ever heard karaoke for your feet?

2308
02:54:40,862 --> 02:54:42,103
[SPEAKER_07]: I've heard the twister thing.

2309
02:54:42,523 --> 02:54:43,544
[SPEAKER_07]: I've heard Simon Says.

2310
02:54:43,564 --> 02:54:44,604
[SPEAKER_07]: I've heard Spider Stomp.

2311
02:54:45,505 --> 02:54:47,366
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, maybe I should ask Jason Enos.

2312
02:54:49,067 --> 02:54:49,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, you know what?

2313
02:54:49,888 --> 02:54:51,989
[SPEAKER_07]: My preschool teacher, her name was Mrs. Enos.

2314
02:54:52,309 --> 02:54:52,970
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know what?

2315
02:54:53,050 --> 02:54:54,070
[SPEAKER_07]: Respect a little bit here.

2316
02:54:54,611 --> 02:54:54,951
[SPEAKER_07]: Pause it.

2317
02:54:56,620 --> 02:55:03,605
[SPEAKER_26]: You are part of the DDR Freaks, and I just have to out you on your age, you're 21 years old, you're not a 6 year old 7 year old.

2318
02:55:03,905 --> 02:55:04,486
[SPEAKER_07]: Pause it.

2319
02:55:05,646 --> 02:55:09,549
[SPEAKER_07]: That was like the most belittling comment there, I have to out you on your age, you're not 6 or 7.

2320
02:55:10,210 --> 02:55:17,675
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause I can't tell by the fact that this guy has facial hair, he's got a little goatee going on, he looks like he's a pretty well built guy.

2321
02:55:17,715 --> 02:55:22,178
[SPEAKER_07]: He does look like, by looks alone here, he does appear to be past puberty.

2322
02:55:23,931 --> 02:55:25,733
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember, the average person is an idiot.

2323
02:55:25,773 --> 02:55:27,294
[SPEAKER_07]: They have to explain these things.

2324
02:55:46,537 --> 02:55:48,678
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm five years older than this guy.

2325
02:55:49,219 --> 02:55:50,320
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie's older than this guy.

2326
02:55:50,400 --> 02:55:51,360
[SPEAKER_06]: Matt's older than this guy.

2327
02:55:51,440 --> 02:55:52,501
[SPEAKER_06]: Bradley's older than this guy.

2328
02:55:52,541 --> 02:55:54,983
[SPEAKER_06]: I think almost everybody in this room, except maybe Jonas.

2329
02:55:55,003 --> 02:55:55,683
[SPEAKER_06]: How old are you, Jonas?

2330
02:55:57,024 --> 02:55:59,365
[SPEAKER_07]: Then everybody in this room except Jonas is older than this guy.

2331
02:56:00,086 --> 02:56:02,708
[SPEAKER_07]: So when she kind of says that to him, I kind of get mad.

2332
02:56:02,768 --> 02:56:04,769
[SPEAKER_07]: But of course this is Fox News and they're stupid anyway.

2333
02:56:04,829 --> 02:56:07,351
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, I'm positive.

2334
02:56:07,371 --> 02:56:08,111
[SPEAKER_12]: 21, yeah.

2335
02:56:08,151 --> 02:56:08,691
[SPEAKER_12]: You like this?

2336
02:56:09,412 --> 02:56:10,833
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, you know what?

2337
02:56:10,853 --> 02:56:11,573
[SPEAKER_12]: Pause it, pause it.

2338
02:56:11,973 --> 02:56:13,134
[SPEAKER_06]: You like this crap.

2339
02:56:14,495 --> 02:56:15,796
[SPEAKER_06]: So you actually like this.

2340
02:56:17,421 --> 02:56:18,521
[SPEAKER_06]: You're so weird!

2341
02:56:18,541 --> 02:56:20,662
[SPEAKER_12]: Unposit.

2342
02:56:20,682 --> 02:56:23,043
[SPEAKER_12]: Who are 14 years old, and I know people who are 40 years old.

2343
02:56:23,163 --> 02:56:25,304
[SPEAKER_12]: They're all playing the game, they all love the game.

2344
02:56:25,504 --> 02:56:29,206
[SPEAKER_12]: For whatever reason, either it's exercise or even competition.

2345
02:56:29,466 --> 02:56:33,167
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, so since this story has kind of a serious angle, we're talking about obesity and kids.

2346
02:56:33,787 --> 02:56:35,288
[SPEAKER_26]: Tell me about the losing weight part.

2347
02:56:35,328 --> 02:56:36,929
[SPEAKER_26]: Does it really make you work up the sweat?

2348
02:56:37,349 --> 02:56:38,109
[SPEAKER_07]: Unposit.

2349
02:56:39,430 --> 02:56:40,290
[SPEAKER_18]: No, you think?

2350
02:56:41,278 --> 02:56:48,382
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to point out at this moment they're showing people dancing on the game wearing these kind of like aerobic looking things.

2351
02:56:49,202 --> 02:56:51,723
[SPEAKER_07]: So, let me get this straight.

2352
02:56:52,503 --> 02:56:53,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me get this straight, Don.

2353
02:56:55,065 --> 02:56:58,126
[SPEAKER_06]: When I move, I'm going to work up a sweat?

2354
02:56:58,306 --> 02:56:59,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that what you're telling me?

2355
02:57:01,528 --> 02:57:01,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Unpause it.

2356
02:57:04,480 --> 02:57:05,320
[SPEAKER_12]: It makes me work a sweat.

2357
02:57:05,460 --> 02:57:13,902
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really, you know, songs can run you, you know, at a very slow pace or can even run you at a very high pace.

2358
02:57:15,362 --> 02:57:20,503
[SPEAKER_12]: Songs can run up to 300 BPM and, you know, a regular song on the radio can only go to about maybe 120.

2359
02:57:20,543 --> 02:57:25,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, obviously they did not prep him with the questions there.

2360
02:57:25,344 --> 02:57:31,086
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you know, no offense to that guy, but songs on the radio only go up to 130 BPM.

2361
02:57:31,126 --> 02:57:32,966
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know so much about that, but anyway...

2362
02:57:34,166 --> 02:57:44,052
[SPEAKER_07]: It's obvious that they did not let him know what the questions would be in advance, so, you know, he's probably just... Because if it were to go over that, you know, just sheer chaos would erupt.

2363
02:57:44,912 --> 02:57:45,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah!

2364
02:57:45,373 --> 02:57:45,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Too fast!

2365
02:57:46,053 --> 02:57:46,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Too fast!

2366
02:57:47,014 --> 02:57:47,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't drive!

2367
02:57:47,634 --> 02:57:48,094
[SPEAKER_04]: Too fast!

2368
02:57:50,115 --> 02:57:54,978
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like nuclear bombs that go off, you know, just the world erupt into pure anarchy.

2369
02:57:54,998 --> 02:57:56,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2370
02:57:56,239 --> 02:57:56,399
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

2371
02:57:57,446 --> 02:57:58,126
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, unpause it.

2372
02:57:58,906 --> 02:57:59,286
[SPEAKER_12]: Pause it.

2373
02:57:59,346 --> 02:58:03,287
[SPEAKER_12]: I would like to point out, lady, you can do anything for hours and hours.

2374
02:58:03,567 --> 02:58:09,669
[SPEAKER_26]: You could play DDR, you could play EverQuest, you could masturbate for hours and hours if you wanted to.

2375
02:58:09,909 --> 02:58:10,549
[SPEAKER_12]: You could, um...

2376
02:58:26,343 --> 02:58:29,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Plot to murder Fox News reporters for hours and hours.

2377
02:58:29,527 --> 02:58:29,887
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm kidding.

2378
02:58:30,428 --> 02:58:31,249
[SPEAKER_07]: Unpause it.

2379
02:58:31,289 --> 02:58:31,910
[SPEAKER_12]: Just one more song.

2380
02:58:31,950 --> 02:58:33,312
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll be right there.

2381
02:58:33,592 --> 02:58:37,457
[SPEAKER_12]: It gets your entire body into it.

2382
02:58:37,477 --> 02:58:38,839
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't even pay attention to yourself.

2383
02:58:39,299 --> 02:58:39,720
[SPEAKER_07]: Pause it.

2384
02:58:40,020 --> 02:58:40,361
[SPEAKER_07]: Pause it.

2385
02:58:40,661 --> 02:58:43,084
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, also they had to show your token Asian playing DDR there.

2386
02:58:43,104 --> 02:58:43,765
[SPEAKER_07]: But I want to point out.

2387
02:58:44,918 --> 02:58:46,818
[SPEAKER_07]: I love how she had to compare it to EverQuest.

2388
02:58:48,099 --> 02:58:49,019
[SPEAKER_18]: Excuse me.

2389
02:58:50,419 --> 02:58:55,720
[SPEAKER_07]: So, does this game get you addicted and then you want to murder people like EverQuest does?

2390
02:58:55,780 --> 02:58:57,840
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think that your friends are orcs?

2391
02:58:58,140 --> 02:59:00,301
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to put my score on eBay and sell it.

2392
02:59:02,601 --> 02:59:03,521
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, now wait a minute.

2393
02:59:03,541 --> 02:59:10,262
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not such a stretch because we all know that there are certain individuals that put their shoes on eBay and some idiot out there is dumb enough to buy it.

2394
02:59:12,343 --> 02:59:13,483
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know anyone who's done that.

2395
02:59:14,467 --> 02:59:17,150
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I could, well, yeah, we'll, anyway.

2396
02:59:17,351 --> 02:59:17,831
[SPEAKER_12]: Unpause it.

2397
02:59:18,252 --> 02:59:27,361
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, losing weight or having fun, you know, playing the game, just, you know, listening to music and... I might add that the terror alert was elevated at the time.

2398
02:59:28,042 --> 02:59:28,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up.

2399
02:59:29,063 --> 02:59:31,766
[SPEAKER_26]: Hey, Jason, it sounds like you should be marketing this to adults.

2400
02:59:31,806 --> 02:59:32,787
[SPEAKER_26]: How much does this game cost?

2401
02:59:32,827 --> 02:59:33,288
[SPEAKER_05]: Pause it.

2402
02:59:33,688 --> 02:59:34,149
[SPEAKER_05]: Pause it.

2403
02:59:37,028 --> 02:59:38,989
[SPEAKER_15]: That is the funniest capture of him, by the way.

2404
02:59:40,549 --> 02:59:42,489
[SPEAKER_07]: There are so many places you could go with this statement.

2405
02:59:42,529 --> 02:59:44,430
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds like a game you should be marketing towards adults.

2406
02:59:45,630 --> 02:59:47,391
[SPEAKER_07]: And why are we all on the Fox News Channel right now?

2407
02:59:47,411 --> 02:59:49,591
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I know so many children that watch the station.

2408
02:59:50,872 --> 02:59:55,373
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you do know any children that watch Fox News Channel, they are being poisoned.

2409
02:59:55,793 --> 02:59:56,553
[SPEAKER_07]: Turn them away.

2410
02:59:56,653 --> 02:59:58,053
[SPEAKER_07]: Make them watch SpongeBob.

2411
02:59:58,234 --> 02:59:58,474
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2412
03:00:02,650 --> 03:00:05,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Pause it.

2413
03:00:06,976 --> 03:00:07,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Totally great.

2414
03:00:08,277 --> 03:00:11,341
[SPEAKER_07]: I love the fact that Jason just happened... Why?

2415
03:00:11,601 --> 03:00:12,943
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so funny you should ask.

2416
03:00:13,043 --> 03:00:15,386
[SPEAKER_07]: I just happen to have the game right here in my hand.

2417
03:00:16,244 --> 03:00:17,425
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so glad you asked!

2418
03:00:17,445 --> 03:00:19,827
[SPEAKER_07]: See, obviously he was prepped on his questions, but that's alright.

2419
03:00:19,947 --> 03:00:20,227
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

2420
03:00:20,247 --> 03:00:21,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Pause it.

2421
03:00:21,668 --> 03:00:22,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Pause it.

2422
03:00:22,169 --> 03:00:23,770
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, I'm too cheap to buy one myself!

2423
03:00:44,591 --> 03:00:46,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Give me one for free, Jason, please.

2424
03:00:46,791 --> 03:00:48,272
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we need to write a letter to them.

2425
03:00:49,452 --> 03:00:51,312
[SPEAKER_16]: Please don't report on DDR again.

2426
03:00:51,772 --> 03:00:53,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Please don't report on anything.

2427
03:00:53,333 --> 03:00:54,853
[SPEAKER_07]: Fox News Channel is a horrible station.

2428
03:00:54,893 --> 03:00:56,433
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, I'll pause it.

2429
03:00:56,473 --> 03:00:59,074
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you so much, Jason, Enos, and Don.

2430
03:00:59,414 --> 03:00:59,914
Enos!

2431
03:01:00,734 --> 03:01:01,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Enos!

2432
03:01:01,974 --> 03:01:04,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me talk about pronunciation here.

2433
03:01:04,635 --> 03:01:06,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it look like there's an I?

2434
03:01:06,135 --> 03:01:07,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it look like there's an E?

2435
03:01:07,535 --> 03:01:10,076
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a fucking O. Enos!

2436
03:01:10,808 --> 03:01:14,750
[SPEAKER_04]: It would even be, if you mispronounce it, it would be like, you know, Pot or something.

2437
03:01:14,770 --> 03:01:17,371
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be Enos, not Enis.

2438
03:01:18,351 --> 03:01:20,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Enos, Enos, not Enis.

2439
03:01:21,252 --> 03:01:23,633
[SPEAKER_04]: You might as well just call him Jason the Penis Man.

2440
03:01:23,673 --> 03:01:26,514
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, seriously, that's what you're... You're fucking stupid.

2441
03:01:27,215 --> 03:01:28,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Learn to pronounce shit.

2442
03:01:31,416 --> 03:01:34,938
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, thank you, Mr. Enos and the little six-year-old from DDR Freaks.

2443
03:01:35,018 --> 03:01:35,798
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much.

2444
03:01:37,039 --> 03:01:37,519
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm positive.

2445
03:01:37,742 --> 03:01:39,344
[SPEAKER_26]: Don D'Amato, thank you very much.

2446
03:01:40,085 --> 03:01:40,345
[SPEAKER_26]: Greg?

2447
03:01:40,525 --> 03:01:41,346
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Derek.

2448
03:01:41,406 --> 03:01:42,207
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, wait, wait, wait.

2449
03:01:42,928 --> 03:01:44,630
[SPEAKER_07]: That guy has such a porn star name, too.

2450
03:01:44,950 --> 03:01:45,190
[SPEAKER_15]: What?

2451
03:01:45,551 --> 03:01:46,251
[SPEAKER_07]: Don D'Amato.

2452
03:01:46,311 --> 03:01:47,833
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of a porn star name, don't you think?

2453
03:01:49,295 --> 03:01:49,615
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

2454
03:01:50,656 --> 03:01:52,959
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you play the clip one more time?

2455
03:01:53,579 --> 03:01:56,723
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I really quickly want to read for you guys the Fox Facts.

2456
03:01:57,335 --> 03:01:58,496
[SPEAKER_07]: Dancing video game can help kids lose weight

2457
03:02:19,133 --> 03:02:19,914
[SPEAKER_26]: or DDR.

2458
03:02:20,314 --> 03:02:23,616
[SPEAKER_26]: Let's kids get their groove on and lose weight at the same time.

2459
03:02:24,056 --> 03:02:31,701
[SPEAKER_26]: With us now, DDR product manager Jason Enos and Don D'Amato, member of a fan club called DDR Freaks.

2460
03:02:31,861 --> 03:02:32,661
[SPEAKER_26]: Welcome both of you.

2461
03:02:33,542 --> 03:02:36,283
[SPEAKER_12]: Still saying dancing video games can help kids lose weight.

2462
03:02:39,007 --> 03:02:41,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, get to the facts.

2463
03:02:41,868 --> 03:02:42,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, here we go.

2464
03:02:42,968 --> 03:02:44,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Jason Enos, CDR project manager.

2465
03:02:44,588 --> 03:02:47,068
[SPEAKER_02]: We all know that.

2466
03:02:48,029 --> 03:02:53,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Enos has helped design numerous video games.

2467
03:02:54,670 --> 03:02:55,410
[SPEAKER_06]: Imagine that.

2468
03:02:55,630 --> 03:02:59,471
[SPEAKER_07]: He works for Konami and he has helped design numerous video games.

2469
03:02:59,971 --> 03:03:00,751
[SPEAKER_02]: I never would have thought.

2470
03:03:00,771 --> 03:03:02,191
[SPEAKER_02]: 15% of American kids are overweight or obese.

2471
03:03:08,936 --> 03:03:12,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that's a fact.

2472
03:03:13,899 --> 03:03:19,361
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to add that Mel B was in this video.

2473
03:03:21,222 --> 03:03:23,263
[SPEAKER_05]: I would be embarrassed to be on this station, but anyway.

2474
03:03:23,283 --> 03:03:23,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Pause it.

2475
03:03:23,503 --> 03:03:26,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Another 15% of kids are at risk of becoming overweight.

2476
03:03:26,305 --> 03:03:27,825
[SPEAKER_02]: They are one Snickers bar away from doom.

2477
03:03:37,631 --> 03:03:39,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Put that kid on Atkins right now!

2478
03:03:39,572 --> 03:03:44,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Now the risk of them becoming overweight, is that meaning that they're at risk of the overweight person eating them?

2479
03:03:44,694 --> 03:03:47,036
[SPEAKER_04]: So therefore they're becoming part of the overweight person?

2480
03:03:47,996 --> 03:03:48,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

2481
03:03:49,017 --> 03:03:51,898
[SPEAKER_26]: Anyways, back to it.

2482
03:03:53,239 --> 03:03:55,680
[SPEAKER_26]: Pause it, I can't resist.

2483
03:03:56,040 --> 03:03:57,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Listen to how she's talking down to him.

2484
03:03:58,821 --> 03:04:03,924
[SPEAKER_06]: So Dawn, you're part of the DDR freaks, and you're not nine years old?

2485
03:04:05,143 --> 03:04:05,783
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, we've got to finish.

2486
03:04:05,963 --> 03:04:06,404
[SPEAKER_07]: Unpause it.

2487
03:04:06,464 --> 03:04:08,925
[SPEAKER_26]: Let's get the rest of the facts.

2488
03:04:10,145 --> 03:04:13,907
[SPEAKER_07]: Over 9 million American kids are overweight or obese.

2489
03:04:14,227 --> 03:04:16,928
[SPEAKER_07]: So they've taken that 15%, and now they've just... You know who's to blame for that?

2490
03:04:16,988 --> 03:04:17,689
[SPEAKER_17]: Mommy and Daddy.

2491
03:04:17,849 --> 03:04:18,669
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I know, I know.

2492
03:04:18,689 --> 03:04:19,710
[SPEAKER_12]: 7-year-old.

2493
03:04:19,810 --> 03:04:20,870
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm 21, yeah.

2494
03:04:20,930 --> 03:04:21,491
[SPEAKER_12]: You like this.

2495
03:04:22,171 --> 03:04:23,511
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, you know what?

2496
03:04:23,571 --> 03:04:24,412
[SPEAKER_12]: I know people who are 40.

2497
03:04:25,732 --> 03:04:30,134
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, of course, his name, Don D'Amato, porn star and DDR Freaks member.

2498
03:04:30,975 --> 03:04:32,756
[SPEAKER_07]: And it says DDR Freaks member.

2499
03:04:32,816 --> 03:04:33,376
[SPEAKER_07]: I love the game.

2500
03:04:34,127 --> 03:04:37,150
[SPEAKER_07]: Domato has played Dance Dance Revolution for years.

2501
03:04:37,730 --> 03:04:39,272
[SPEAKER_07]: For whatever reason.

2502
03:04:39,752 --> 03:04:43,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Over 10% of children aged 2 to 5 are overweight.

2503
03:04:44,696 --> 03:04:47,499
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you so should get your 2-year-old into DDR.

2504
03:04:47,519 --> 03:04:51,382
[SPEAKER_04]: 2-year-olds aren't... Yeah, those are the people that are fucking putting those stupid kids on the pads.

2505
03:04:51,703 --> 03:04:53,685
[SPEAKER_18]: I want my fat bitch to get you.

2506
03:04:55,166 --> 03:04:57,007
[SPEAKER_18]: Less fat and less bitchy.

2507
03:04:59,471 --> 03:05:01,732
[SPEAKER_12]: Either it's exercise or even competition.

2508
03:05:01,992 --> 03:05:07,833
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, so since this story has kind of a serious angle, we're talking about obesity and kids, tell me about the losing weight part.

2509
03:05:07,853 --> 03:05:09,454
[SPEAKER_26]: Does it really make you work up a sweat?

2510
03:05:09,874 --> 03:05:11,314
[SPEAKER_12]: It makes me work a sweat.

2511
03:05:11,894 --> 03:05:14,815
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really, you know... Pause it.

2512
03:05:15,435 --> 03:05:18,996
[SPEAKER_07]: Kids need 60 minutes of activity a day for their health.

2513
03:05:19,176 --> 03:05:23,137
[SPEAKER_07]: So kids, start having sex early because you need 60 minutes of it every day.

2514
03:05:23,157 --> 03:05:26,498
[SPEAKER_12]: It can run you, you know, at a very slow pace or...

2515
03:05:27,600 --> 03:05:33,103
[SPEAKER_06]: approximately one half of kids do vigorous physical activity regularly.

2516
03:05:33,584 --> 03:05:39,727
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I would like to readjust that number to about 99% of teenagers who masturbate frequently.

2517
03:05:40,387 --> 03:05:41,188
[SPEAKER_16]: What arcade is that?

2518
03:05:41,789 --> 03:05:42,949
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no idea what arcade it is.

2519
03:05:42,969 --> 03:05:44,470
[SPEAKER_07]: Does it look familiar to you or something?

2520
03:05:44,690 --> 03:05:46,710
[SPEAKER_12]: It could even run you at a very high pace.

2521
03:05:47,911 --> 03:05:53,152
[SPEAKER_12]: Songs can run up to 300 BPM and, you know, a regular song on the radio can only go to about maybe 120.

2522
03:05:54,092 --> 03:06:01,254
[SPEAKER_12]: So maybe songs can end up being about three times as fast and moving around three times as fast as any, you know, normal buddy.

2523
03:06:03,195 --> 03:06:08,316
[SPEAKER_07]: Approximately one quarter of kids report no vigorous physical activity.

2524
03:06:10,677 --> 03:06:11,077
[SPEAKER_07]: And the other...

2525
03:06:12,372 --> 03:06:14,133
[SPEAKER_07]: And that quarter would be the liars.

2526
03:06:14,253 --> 03:06:18,515
[SPEAKER_26]: No, I'm kidding.

2527
03:06:18,795 --> 03:06:19,635
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

2528
03:06:19,935 --> 03:06:22,477
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be funny because if they muted out that it was about DDR.

2529
03:06:22,777 --> 03:06:24,518
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is something you could do for hours and hours.

2530
03:06:24,558 --> 03:06:25,018
[SPEAKER_07]: You can.

2531
03:06:25,098 --> 03:06:25,518
[SPEAKER_07]: You can.

2532
03:06:26,078 --> 03:06:26,478
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, sorry.

2533
03:06:26,979 --> 03:06:27,959
[SPEAKER_07]: A quarter of U.S.

2534
03:06:28,039 --> 03:06:31,901
[SPEAKER_07]: kids spend four or more hours a day watching TV.

2535
03:06:33,024 --> 03:06:39,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Could part of that four hours be watching TV to, you know, see the arrows that are going up the screen to play the game?

2536
03:06:40,187 --> 03:06:40,948
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't mean that.

2537
03:06:40,968 --> 03:06:42,428
[SPEAKER_17]: Actually watching television programming.

2538
03:06:43,129 --> 03:06:43,449
[SPEAKER_12]: Whatever.

2539
03:06:44,662 --> 03:06:44,982
[SPEAKER_12]: No shit.

2540
03:06:45,022 --> 03:06:46,423
[SPEAKER_12]: Pause it, pause it, pause it.

2541
03:06:46,463 --> 03:06:48,165
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you sense it a little bit in his reaction?

2542
03:07:12,364 --> 03:07:14,186
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you sense it just a little bit in his reaction?

2543
03:07:14,226 --> 03:07:15,707
[SPEAKER_07]: He's just kind of like, no shit, lady.

2544
03:07:15,727 --> 03:07:17,970
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think I'm doing on your piece of shit television station?

2545
03:07:18,030 --> 03:07:18,570
[SPEAKER_15]: I think so.

2546
03:07:19,271 --> 03:07:20,172
[SPEAKER_07]: I see it a little bit.

2547
03:07:20,552 --> 03:07:23,555
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to say that's what he meant to say, but I sense it a little bit.

2548
03:07:24,256 --> 03:07:32,464
[SPEAKER_04]: We just brought out our latest... The next time I see him, hopefully at E3 this year, I'm going to ask him, don't you think you should be marketing this game for adults?

2549
03:07:34,046 --> 03:07:35,187
[SPEAKER_04]: See if he gets the joke.

2550
03:07:35,635 --> 03:07:37,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Also give you a dollar for that.

2551
03:07:38,256 --> 03:07:39,056
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll double that.

2552
03:07:39,236 --> 03:07:41,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Dance Dance Revolution Extreme for the PlayStation 2.

2553
03:07:42,076 --> 03:07:45,837
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the fast facts went away so that we can see the nice cover of CDR Extreme.

2554
03:07:45,877 --> 03:07:49,678
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have a version that comes with the dance pad so you can get started right away for $59.99.

2555
03:07:51,198 --> 03:07:51,698
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, wow.

2556
03:07:51,818 --> 03:07:55,939
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm going to have to ask our promo department if we've got... Same one, same tag.

2557
03:07:55,999 --> 03:07:56,899
[SPEAKER_26]: That looks kind of good.

2558
03:07:56,979 --> 03:08:00,180
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you so much, Jason Enos and Don DiMato.

2559
03:08:00,280 --> 03:08:01,100
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you very much.

2560
03:08:01,120 --> 03:08:01,840
[SPEAKER_29]: You're welcome.

2561
03:08:01,860 --> 03:08:02,100
[SPEAKER_26]: Greg?

2562
03:08:02,301 --> 03:08:02,781
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Derek.

2563
03:08:08,041 --> 03:08:09,101
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what we're here for.

2564
03:08:09,742 --> 03:08:10,082
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at this.

2565
03:08:10,122 --> 03:08:12,362
[SPEAKER_07]: Our longest show ever, thanks to that little clip.

2566
03:08:12,382 --> 03:08:13,163
[SPEAKER_17]: I need to go home.

2567
03:08:13,523 --> 03:08:13,823
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

2568
03:08:14,083 --> 03:08:15,864
[SPEAKER_07]: It needed to be made fun of, though.

2569
03:08:15,884 --> 03:08:16,584
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I know.

2570
03:08:16,704 --> 03:08:25,967
[SPEAKER_07]: With all respect to Don and Jason for being good sports with that interview, we just had to... I'll take any chance I can to make fun of Fox News.

2571
03:08:27,207 --> 03:08:29,488
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, let's move on with our final thoughts.

2572
03:08:29,508 --> 03:08:31,108
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got to wrap up this show.

2573
03:08:31,448 --> 03:08:32,549
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll start off with our guests.

2574
03:08:32,669 --> 03:08:33,349
[SPEAKER_01]: Start off with Jonas.

2575
03:08:34,969 --> 03:08:35,970
[SPEAKER_01]: Jason Enis.

2576
03:08:39,581 --> 03:08:39,862
[SPEAKER_08]: Angel.

2577
03:08:43,104 --> 03:08:43,524
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

2578
03:08:43,604 --> 03:08:45,206
[SPEAKER_13]: All I can think about is Final Fantasy XIV.

2579
03:08:45,306 --> 03:08:45,886
[SPEAKER_13]: Please kill me.

2580
03:08:47,327 --> 03:08:47,567
[SPEAKER_07]: Addict.

2581
03:08:48,088 --> 03:08:50,290
[SPEAKER_07]: And Arcadian42.

2582
03:08:51,611 --> 03:08:52,471
[SPEAKER_07]: Last week is a tip.

2583
03:08:52,531 --> 03:08:53,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay.

2584
03:08:53,332 --> 03:08:53,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Finally.

2585
03:08:55,233 --> 03:08:55,714
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay.

2586
03:08:56,194 --> 03:08:58,636
[SPEAKER_07]: My thought is we didn't even get through all of this week's news.

2587
03:08:58,656 --> 03:08:59,797
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how crazy of a week it was.

2588
03:08:59,817 --> 03:09:03,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Why is it that the Monty News always is like all of a sudden it's all in one week?

2589
03:09:03,840 --> 03:09:05,161
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll just have to carry it over to next week.

2590
03:09:05,341 --> 03:09:05,701
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

2595
03:09:21,029 --> 03:09:22,510
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, your final thought?

2596
03:09:23,150 --> 03:09:24,611
[SPEAKER_15]: My intestines hurt.

2597
03:09:25,372 --> 03:09:26,132
[SPEAKER_15]: Damn carbs.

2598
03:09:27,633 --> 03:09:29,875
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, and, uh... Oh, I have one more thing.

2599
03:09:29,975 --> 03:09:30,175
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

2600
03:09:30,495 --> 03:09:33,137
[SPEAKER_17]: The only person you have to blame is yourself.

2601
03:09:34,298 --> 03:09:34,558
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

2602
03:09:34,918 --> 03:09:37,159

[SPEAKER_07]: Orange Lounge Radio, the afterbirth, the part after the credits.

2621
03:12:12,291 --> 03:12:17,293
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, we've already given you an extra bonus ten minutes tonight, so you should be thankful for that.

03:12:17,333 --> 03:12:18,014
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going home.

03:12:18,114 --> 03:12:19,414
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, you've got to get home, Jamie.

2624
03:12:20,115 --> 03:12:20,955
[SPEAKER_07]: Jonas is leaving.

2625
03:12:20,975 --> 03:12:22,896
[SPEAKER_17]: I have to do my quiz for database management.

2626
03:12:22,956 --> 03:12:26,058
[SPEAKER_07]: Our listeners are all leaving too, so it's going to be short.

2627
03:12:27,518 --> 03:12:44,240
[SPEAKER_07]: I definitely want to play this for you guys, because I just got it, and we've been talking about it a little bit before earlier, so you know I've got to play this for you guys now that we've got it, thank you Ninst for passing this along, but we did manage to get that echo image, never ending story, what is this?

2628
03:12:44,778 --> 03:12:48,201
[SPEAKER_07]: The NeverEnding Story Fantasy Remix, or what is that?

2629
03:12:48,221 --> 03:12:48,741
[SPEAKER_07]: Fantasia.

2630
03:12:48,761 --> 03:12:49,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Fantasia Mix.

2631
03:12:50,022 --> 03:12:52,764
[SPEAKER_07]: So we don't know if this is the actual NeverEnding Story theme song.

2632
03:12:52,824 --> 03:12:55,446
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, but it has NeverEnding Story and Fantasia.

2633
03:12:55,466 --> 03:12:58,188
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's kind of not really a... And it's Echo Image.

2634
03:12:58,208 --> 03:12:59,729
[SPEAKER_07]: How can you go wrong with this, no matter what it is?

2635
03:13:00,610 --> 03:13:01,150
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's hear it.

2636
03:13:01,450 --> 03:13:01,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's hear it.

2637
03:13:02,091 --> 03:13:02,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

2638
03:13:23,081 --> 03:13:24,302
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I'm just a child.

2639
03:13:24,342 --> 03:13:24,642
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry.

2640
03:13:24,662 --> 03:13:25,202
[SPEAKER_18]: I knew everything.

2641
03:13:25,262 --> 03:13:25,662
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm so sorry.

2642
03:13:25,723 --> 03:13:26,503
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't forgive you.

2643
03:13:26,563 --> 03:13:27,063
[SPEAKER_18]: I just can't wait.

2644
03:14:10,686 --> 03:14:16,849
[SPEAKER_19]: Look at what you see in the face, the mirror of your dreams.

2645
03:14:16,869 --> 03:14:19,631
Believe I'm a hero, hidden in the light, written on the pages.

2646
03:15:07,685 --> 03:15:10,329
One keep the secret We'll fall behind the clouds They are among the rainbows

2647
03:17:33,153 --> 03:17:39,019
[SPEAKER_07]: Echo Image there, who we've all fallen in love with recently with a kick-ass version of Never Ending Story.

2648
03:17:39,079 --> 03:17:39,319
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

2649
03:17:39,719 --> 03:17:43,643
[SPEAKER_07]: As I told Sigurd in private message, we've been having a little bit of a private message chat going back and forth.

2650
03:17:43,944 --> 03:17:45,045
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to have sex with that song.

2651
03:17:46,913 --> 03:17:47,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Downright.

2652
03:17:47,474 --> 03:17:49,855
[SPEAKER_04]: That song is everything that I imagined it would be.

2653
03:17:50,415 --> 03:17:51,416
[SPEAKER_07]: That was so hot.

2654
03:17:51,776 --> 03:17:52,797
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so unbelievably hot.

2655
03:17:52,897 --> 03:17:53,337
[SPEAKER_07]: I loved it.

2656
03:17:53,717 --> 03:17:55,338
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is why I had to download... God damn it.

2657
03:17:55,378 --> 03:17:57,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Why couldn't you have put that in Cage Match?

2658
03:17:57,319 --> 03:18:00,321
[SPEAKER_07]: As much as I love Come Back, that would have been a much better song.

2659
03:18:00,661 --> 03:18:01,181
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

2660
03:18:01,562 --> 03:18:03,283
[SPEAKER_04]: I did download... What did I get earlier?

2661
03:18:03,323 --> 03:18:05,404
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to get that off your computer too, that song.

2662
03:18:06,024 --> 03:18:10,507
[SPEAKER_04]: I did download the Icon of Coil remix of Skull.

2663
03:18:10,527 --> 03:18:11,327
[SPEAKER_07]: Play like a little bit of that.

2664
03:18:11,467 --> 03:18:12,348
[SPEAKER_07]: The Icon of Coil?

2665
03:18:12,648 --> 03:18:14,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Coil, it's another... Play like a little clip.

2666
03:18:14,489 --> 03:18:14,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Go in the middle.

2667
03:18:18,091 --> 03:18:19,331
[SPEAKER_07]: Kill our speakers there, why don't you?

2668
03:18:19,351 --> 03:18:20,352
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot I turned it up for that.

2669
03:18:20,452 --> 03:18:21,292
[SPEAKER_07]: Way to go, genius.

2670
03:18:41,107 --> 03:18:42,888
[SPEAKER_07]: They're an industrial band, by the way.

2671
03:18:43,348 --> 03:18:43,728
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

2672
03:18:44,909 --> 03:18:45,469
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, stop it.

2673
03:18:45,830 --> 03:18:46,110
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

2674
03:18:47,050 --> 03:18:51,253
[SPEAKER_07]: I swear to God, I'm going to start like an Echo Image fan site on orisonradio.com.

2675
03:18:51,493 --> 03:18:53,554
[SPEAKER_07]: I just, God, they are so good.

2676
03:18:54,294 --> 03:18:56,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Note said, and I just noticed this.

2677
03:18:57,136 --> 03:18:59,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I don't know about this because I was looking at their discography.

2678
03:18:59,857 --> 03:19:00,838
[SPEAKER_04]: They only have one album.

2679
03:19:01,278 --> 03:19:01,658
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

2680
03:19:02,178 --> 03:19:03,139
[SPEAKER_07]: It's because people don't know it.

2681
03:19:03,859 --> 03:19:04,099
[SPEAKER_07]: One album.

2682
03:19:04,119 --> 03:19:05,160
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm spreading the word.

2683
03:19:06,041 --> 03:19:07,241
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't download this shit.

2684
03:19:07,321 --> 03:19:08,622
[SPEAKER_07]: Go buy the album.

2685
03:19:08,662 --> 03:19:09,522
[SPEAKER_07]: You won't regret it.

2686
03:19:09,723 --> 03:19:10,523
[SPEAKER_07]: I swear you won't.

2687
03:19:12,256 --> 03:19:15,898
[SPEAKER_07]: And as soon as I can find a copy of the album, I'm going to buy it legitimately too, I swear.

2688
03:19:15,958 --> 03:19:16,838
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to order it on Amazon.

2689
03:19:16,898 --> 03:19:23,601
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope to God that what they really need to do, and I'm really saying what they need to do, is they need to gather all these artists on this label here.

2690
03:19:24,201 --> 03:19:25,642
[SPEAKER_04]: I forget what it's called now.

2691
03:19:25,902 --> 03:19:28,263
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyways, gather all the artists, throw a concert.

2692
03:19:28,523 --> 03:19:30,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Just even like two cities or something.

2693
03:19:31,285 --> 03:19:35,727
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's expensive to throw a concert, but these are artists that no one's ever heard of.

2694
03:19:36,127 --> 03:19:39,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe get the label to come and chip in a little bit of money.

2695
03:19:39,488 --> 03:19:40,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Or even just one concert.

2696
03:19:40,729 --> 03:19:40,949
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean...

2697
03:19:41,533 --> 03:19:41,973
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
