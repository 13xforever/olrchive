76
00:07:33,074 --> 00:07:40,418
[SPEAKER_04]: I know a lot of you guys have had bagels on your mind all week, and we will be spreading the news about what the latest clue is all about.

77
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:42,679
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not going to... I've got to clarify something, though.

78
00:07:42,979 --> 00:07:44,780
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not blatantly giving you the song.

79
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,541
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just giving you a little kick in the ass.

80
00:07:47,847 --> 00:07:51,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Give me a little kick in the ass to get you charged up and figure out what that song is all about.

00:07:52,951 --> 00:07:54,612
[SPEAKER_04]: All this and plenty of Bomani news.

82
00:07:54,672 --> 00:07:55,292
[SPEAKER_04]: How was your week?

83
00:07:55,312 --> 00:07:56,153

Can you see me?

92
00:08:26,265 --> 00:08:27,465
I'm a face door.

93
00:08:27,485 --> 00:08:28,546
Can you hear me?

94
00:08:28,606 --> 00:08:29,686
I'm a face door.

104
00:13:47,219 --> 00:13:53,322
[SPEAKER_26]: But hey, if you're a broke ass like I am, why don't you come to one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.

[SPEAKER_26]: It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.

107
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:03,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Gee, that guy sounds awfully familiar.

108
00:14:03,381 --> 00:14:04,242
[SPEAKER_26]: I wonder who that was.

109
00:14:04,382 --> 00:14:06,604
[SPEAKER_04]: He sounds like somebody I've heard from very recently.

110
00:14:07,344 --> 00:14:09,606
[SPEAKER_04]: He sounds very, very familiar to me.

111
00:14:10,246 --> 00:14:11,006
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing, FlowWalk?

112
00:14:12,327 --> 00:14:17,131
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, man, it's been pretty busy lately and I have no idea who the hell you're talking about from that promo.

113
00:14:17,211 --> 00:14:20,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the answer is hazy.

114
00:14:20,273 --> 00:14:20,913
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what's going on.

115
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:23,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio www.orangeloungeradio.com

[SPEAKER_04]: and click on chat and you can interact with the chat room there.

117
00:14:42,853 --> 00:14:46,236
[SPEAKER_04]: And Jamie is chatting with our listeners there, having a grand old time.

118
00:14:47,476 --> 00:14:52,420
[SPEAKER_04]: And she's having to put the smack down when necessary as well because she don't tolerate no flaming.

119
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Except, you know, gay kind of flaming.

120
00:14:54,742 --> 00:14:55,202
[SPEAKER_04]: That's okay.

121
00:14:55,322 --> 00:14:56,123
[SPEAKER_04]: But, like, flaming.

122
00:14:56,943 --> 00:14:57,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

123
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, no being a poopy head on Jamie's watch.

124
00:15:02,954 --> 00:15:06,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, we have the Skype line, which we will certainly open up a little bit later in the show.

126
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:18,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, we're going to start off tonight's show as we do every week's show, playing a little bit of How was your week?

127
00:15:18,946 --> 00:15:19,626
[SPEAKER_04]: How was your day?

128
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:24,350
[SPEAKER_04]: And starting us off, as always, our lovely, our own Dark Sakura.

129
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:30,314
[SPEAKER_18]: I worked, and I went to school, and then something that...

130
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,962
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sure Melody will expand on as well.

131
00:15:35,964 --> 00:15:43,030
[SPEAKER_11]: We got interviewed for a magazine.

132
00:15:43,991 --> 00:15:45,352
[SPEAKER_18]: For a Lifetime magazine.

133
00:15:46,212 --> 00:15:47,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Lifetime TV for Women?

134
00:15:47,834 --> 00:15:51,077
[SPEAKER_18]: I guess so.

135
00:15:51,577 --> 00:15:53,999
[SPEAKER_18]: For the fitness benefits of DDR.

136
00:15:56,881 --> 00:15:57,082
[SPEAKER_18]: So...

137
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:05,401
[SPEAKER_13]: Coming up next on Lifetime, Sally Field stars in My Burning Vagina.

138
00:16:08,123 --> 00:16:14,106
[SPEAKER_04]: A story about a woman overcoming her vaginal difficulties in that time of the month.

139
00:16:14,827 --> 00:16:18,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Also coming up, Sharks Girl and Dark Sakura interviewed about DDR.

140
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:29,438
[SPEAKER_04]: DDR Stop... Hear how DDR helped them overcome their burning vaginas.

141
00:16:34,182 --> 00:16:34,982
[SPEAKER_04]: God, I love this show.

142
00:16:40,126 --> 00:16:41,567
[SPEAKER_18]: We jumped the shark like when?

143
00:16:42,148 --> 00:16:43,849
[SPEAKER_18]: Like episode two?

144
00:16:43,949 --> 00:16:44,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Episode two.

145
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:47,372
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I wasn't here.

146
00:16:47,472 --> 00:16:48,332
[SPEAKER_18]: That set the pace.

147
00:16:48,352 --> 00:16:50,154
[SPEAKER_18]: Jamie's going on vacation for two weeks.

148
00:16:51,795 --> 00:16:53,236
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, bye y'all, I'm going to Alabama.

149
00:16:54,665 --> 00:17:04,328
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, so my week has been kind of okay.

150
00:17:04,728 --> 00:17:10,429
[SPEAKER_18]: I just hung out, did stuff, went to school, spent a lot of time at school, did homework.

151
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:14,551
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I still have no air conditioning, but that's coming up in the FUs of the week.

152
00:17:15,551 --> 00:17:22,713
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's really... By the way, as a reminder, Orange Launch Radio is based in the Sacramento Valley, where we get temperatures of 110 degrees in the summertime.

153
00:17:23,533 --> 00:17:25,834
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, and if you don't have AC, it sucks.

154
00:17:26,755 --> 00:17:29,696
[SPEAKER_18]: And if you don't have AC in your car, it sucks even more.

155
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:31,617
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I could have just escaped to my car.

156
00:17:32,138 --> 00:17:33,759
[SPEAKER_18]: Dan's like, summer's almost over.

157
00:17:33,959 --> 00:17:35,760
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't have to get AC for your car now.

158
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:42,843
[SPEAKER_04]: As my mother said, you use the old 2 and 70 trick.

159
00:17:42,883 --> 00:17:44,684
[SPEAKER_04]: You roll down two windows and drive 70 miles an hour.

160
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:46,625
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what?

161
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:49,167
[SPEAKER_18]: That would work if one of my windows would roll down.

162
00:17:50,327 --> 00:17:51,068
[SPEAKER_20]: Use in the ghetto.

163
00:17:51,929 --> 00:17:56,172
[SPEAKER_18]: Dude, no, it's not, I don't know what it is, but after my car got raped, it hasn't been the same.

164
00:17:56,192 --> 00:17:59,614
[SPEAKER_18]: Your car got raped?

165
00:17:59,654 --> 00:18:00,975
[SPEAKER_18]: My car got raped, remember?

166
00:18:01,135 --> 00:18:03,056
[SPEAKER_02]: Did it have a burning vagina afterwards?

167
00:18:04,077 --> 00:18:05,137
[SPEAKER_18]: It got raped in the side.

168
00:18:05,577 --> 00:18:05,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

169
00:18:05,938 --> 00:18:06,998
[SPEAKER_18]: Remember when they broke it in half?

170
00:18:07,018 --> 00:18:08,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, it got raped in the ear?

171
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:08,879
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

172
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:09,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Amazing.

173
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:14,283
[SPEAKER_18]: I guess they didn't think my car, you know, well they did get, they did, you know, get in the rear end too, you know, my truck.

174
00:18:14,323 --> 00:18:16,804
[SPEAKER_04]: The trunk was all empty.

175
00:18:16,844 --> 00:18:19,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Your car got it in the rear end.

176
00:18:19,626 --> 00:18:20,967
[SPEAKER_18]: Dude, my car was all fucked up.

177
00:18:21,983 --> 00:18:23,264
[SPEAKER_18]: At least it has the back window now.

178
00:18:24,124 --> 00:18:24,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

179
00:18:28,426 --> 00:18:30,267
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, I'm laughing at the chatroom.

180
00:18:30,307 --> 00:18:36,390
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I'm playing mommy in the chatroom because there was this stupid fucker in there earlier who was being an asshole to everybody.

181
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,771
[SPEAKER_18]: So now he doesn't get to play with us anymore.

182
00:18:39,611 --> 00:18:40,652
[SPEAKER_18]: And that made me feel good.

183
00:18:41,732 --> 00:18:43,473
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I feel good when I do my job.

184
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:46,594
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you were young, did you used to ban children from the playground?

185
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:48,815
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I just beat them with sticks.

186
00:18:48,835 --> 00:18:49,676
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

187
00:18:49,776 --> 00:18:50,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

188
00:18:50,971 --> 00:18:54,955
[SPEAKER_18]: and played tetherball with them and then aimed the tetherball at them.

189
00:18:57,017 --> 00:18:59,099
[SPEAKER_18]: I play well with others when they're the target.

190
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:00,720
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm done.

191
00:19:01,901 --> 00:19:02,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on.

192
00:19:02,502 --> 00:19:04,023
[SPEAKER_04]: DDR Angel, how was your week?

193
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:04,544
[SPEAKER_04]: How was your day?

194
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:05,945
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, let's see.

195
00:19:05,985 --> 00:19:07,967
[SPEAKER_19]: You better have a mic nearby because you may laugh at this.

196
00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:12,972
[SPEAKER_19]: I found out... I mean, what?

197
00:19:14,392 --> 00:19:19,836
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, I found out that there is a haunted house by my old house that I used to live at that I just moved away from.

198
00:19:19,856 --> 00:19:21,318
[SPEAKER_11]: Is this the fort?

199
00:19:21,438 --> 00:19:22,218
[SPEAKER_19]: No, it's not the fort.

200
00:19:22,298 --> 00:19:22,799
[SPEAKER_19]: But you know what?

201
00:19:23,099 --> 00:19:28,884
[SPEAKER_19]: I was going to blame it on Loki's little portal from hell, but I can't because it's not even built yet.

202
00:19:30,105 --> 00:19:37,991
[SPEAKER_19]: And then, after I found out about the house, I found out that two days ago it miraculously burned down...

203
00:19:38,712 --> 00:19:44,275
[SPEAKER_19]: without affecting any of the vegetation around it or the oak tree that was right next to it.

204
00:19:44,415 --> 00:19:46,336
[SPEAKER_04]: I see burning as a running theme on tonight's show.

205
00:19:46,797 --> 00:19:52,720
[SPEAKER_19]: Apparently.

206
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Let the joke die.

207
00:19:55,201 --> 00:19:56,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Step away from the joke.

208
00:19:56,982 --> 00:19:59,704
[SPEAKER_19]: Speaking of joke, should I reveal it now or later?

209
00:20:01,145 --> 00:20:02,826
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we need to do Loki's present now.

210
00:20:02,846 --> 00:20:03,266
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

211
00:20:03,286 --> 00:20:03,506
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

212
00:20:04,492 --> 00:20:05,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's embarrass him now.

213
00:20:05,953 --> 00:20:06,213
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

214
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:07,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on, Loki.

215
00:20:07,614 --> 00:20:07,834
[SPEAKER_19]: Good.

216
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:08,394
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

217
00:20:08,454 --> 00:20:12,156
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to have the mic in my hand and I'm just going to talk the whole time.

218
00:20:12,656 --> 00:20:13,896
[SPEAKER_06]: But my birthday's not until next week.

219
00:20:14,537 --> 00:20:15,637
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care.

220
00:20:15,677 --> 00:20:17,138
[SPEAKER_04]: You're getting your birthday present now.

221
00:20:17,238 --> 00:20:20,219
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it when I get presents early because it makes my birthday last longer.

222
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:21,960
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

223
00:20:23,201 --> 00:20:25,602
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki's going to open the gift.

224
00:20:25,742 --> 00:20:28,743
[SPEAKER_04]: I need some good gift opening music here if I can find something.

225
00:20:29,424 --> 00:20:32,585
[SPEAKER_19]: And you have to promise that I get to take a picture of it afterwards.

226
00:20:33,706 --> 00:20:34,046
[SPEAKER_19]: That's all.

227
00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:38,671
[SPEAKER_19]: and I will give the picture up to OrangeDanceRadio.com to post it.

228
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:39,331
[SPEAKER_19]: Because it's funny.

229
00:20:41,132 --> 00:20:42,212
[SPEAKER_19]: Because there's no lid.

230
00:20:44,573 --> 00:20:44,954
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright.

231
00:20:45,474 --> 00:20:46,374
[SPEAKER_04]: He's opening the gift.

232
00:20:46,814 --> 00:20:47,855
[SPEAKER_19]: He is opening the gift.

233
00:20:48,115 --> 00:20:51,397
[SPEAKER_19]: And mind you, this is a joke upon all jokes.

234
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:52,697
[SPEAKER_19]: I thought it was really cool.

235
00:20:53,918 --> 00:20:54,718
[SPEAKER_19]: Hopefully he likes it.

236
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,701
[SPEAKER_19]: It must go on the webcam.

237
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:01,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my.

238
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:01,781
[SPEAKER_19]: Other side.

239
00:21:02,061 --> 00:21:03,062
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little baby...

240
00:21:03,635 --> 00:21:04,135
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, it is.

241
00:21:04,495 --> 00:21:06,136
[SPEAKER_19]: But what is the baby holding?

242
00:21:08,657 --> 00:21:09,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Did it drop something?

243
00:21:09,538 --> 00:21:10,378
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it dropped something.

244
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:13,339
[SPEAKER_19]: Besides the card.

245
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:25,024
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a little help with the artwork, but... For those listening at home, Loki has been given an Iraqi suicide baby for his birthday.

246
00:21:27,385 --> 00:21:30,587
[SPEAKER_04]: For those who have been listening about 50 episodes ago, you'll get that inside joke.

247
00:21:31,221 --> 00:21:32,342
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a bad inside joke.

248
00:21:32,642 --> 00:21:34,043
[SPEAKER_19]: I admit it's a bad inside joke.

249
00:21:34,323 --> 00:21:38,545
[SPEAKER_19]: It's one that, you know, we've burnt to the ground, but hey, I said burnt at Gatsby.

250
00:21:38,805 --> 00:21:39,806
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, anyway.

251
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:41,147
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey, I thought it was cool.

252
00:21:41,507 --> 00:21:42,147
[SPEAKER_19]: I hope he likes it.

253
00:21:42,688 --> 00:21:44,529
[SPEAKER_19]: It needs to go on the webcam, though, because it's funny.

254
00:21:54,454 --> 00:21:55,875
[SPEAKER_11]: So, he broke the webcam.

255
00:21:55,895 --> 00:21:56,535
[SPEAKER_11]: Five seconds.

256
00:22:00,143 --> 00:22:06,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Angel, is there anything else you wanted to talk about with your week and your day?

257
00:22:07,527 --> 00:22:08,588
[SPEAKER_19]: Not that I can think of at the moment.

258
00:22:08,988 --> 00:22:10,389
[SPEAKER_19]: I will probably give the mic later.

259
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:14,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Then let's speak to Mr. Floatwalk.

260
00:22:14,091 --> 00:22:14,691
[SPEAKER_04]: How was your week?

261
00:22:14,732 --> 00:22:15,292
[SPEAKER_04]: How was your day?

262
00:22:16,172 --> 00:22:16,593
[SPEAKER_26]: The week?

263
00:22:16,713 --> 00:22:27,459
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, anyone who knows what I do, it's just been non-stop work for this whole week with so many things getting ready to ship out for this Christmas season.

264
00:22:28,602 --> 00:22:30,243
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard a rumor you work for some game company.

265
00:22:30,643 --> 00:22:32,125
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, who'd have thunk it?

266
00:22:33,126 --> 00:22:40,732
[SPEAKER_26]: Let's see, but the cool thing about that, I managed to steal myself some good swag during the week, got some Silent Hill 4 posters.

267
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:42,894
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't start borrowing without returning.

268
00:22:44,055 --> 00:22:44,956
[SPEAKER_26]: Nah, it was given.

269
00:22:45,176 --> 00:22:46,017
[SPEAKER_26]: I asked and I took.

270
00:22:46,838 --> 00:22:55,185
[SPEAKER_26]: It's a cool thing to go into their boiler room and see all the promo stuff from every game that's ever been made, and posters, boxes, all that.

271
00:22:55,768 --> 00:22:56,168
[SPEAKER_26]: Pretty neat.

272
00:22:56,268 --> 00:22:58,589
[SPEAKER_26]: And I saw about 500 Extreme V-Rares.

273
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:01,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I visit Konami and borrow things?

274
00:23:02,951 --> 00:23:04,312
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, you do know me, you know.

275
00:23:04,372 --> 00:23:06,853
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, my name does have a lot of clout out there.

276
00:23:07,093 --> 00:23:08,674
[SPEAKER_26]: Just don't turn to a name dropper, you know.

277
00:23:08,714 --> 00:23:10,275
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be bad.

278
00:23:10,315 --> 00:23:10,655
[SPEAKER_04]: I won't.

279
00:23:10,695 --> 00:23:13,236
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not like a particular pool ball.

280
00:23:13,276 --> 00:23:14,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, sorry, sorry.

281
00:23:14,217 --> 00:23:16,038
[SPEAKER_26]: But yeah, the other stuff in the week.

282
00:23:16,258 --> 00:23:19,399
[SPEAKER_26]: I actually went to a concert on Friday night.

283
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,421
[SPEAKER_26]: Went to go see Kanye West and Usher in concert.

284
00:23:24,141 --> 00:23:25,162
[SPEAKER_26]: And that was...

285
00:23:25,518 --> 00:23:31,363
[SPEAKER_26]: It was a pretty happening event, but I must say, it was pretty entertaining just to see the crowd.

286
00:23:34,907 --> 00:23:36,788
[SPEAKER_04]: What kind of crowd did they have at an Usher concert?

287
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:37,329
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm curious.

288
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:38,991
[SPEAKER_26]: Everything you expect.

289
00:23:39,051 --> 00:23:42,514
[SPEAKER_26]: Every girl from like 12 to 35, you know, just chicks everywhere.

290
00:23:42,634 --> 00:23:45,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Did Usher take his shirt off at some point during the concert?

291
00:23:45,296 --> 00:23:45,877
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, you could tell.

292
00:23:45,917 --> 00:23:47,198
[SPEAKER_26]: You didn't even have to see the stage.

293
00:23:47,418 --> 00:23:50,621
[SPEAKER_26]: You just heard like the loudest screaming you've ever heard.

294
00:23:50,881 --> 00:23:51,322
[SPEAKER_26]: Imagine like...

295
00:23:51,961 --> 00:23:53,381
[SPEAKER_26]: 20,000 Banshees going wild.

296
00:23:53,582 --> 00:23:56,402
[SPEAKER_26]: That was just real.

297
00:23:56,943 --> 00:24:00,684
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, it's funny to see just how girls react over just one guy on stage.

298
00:24:00,744 --> 00:24:11,447
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, one of the funniest stories about that, I mean, I have like so many stories about that concert alone, but probably the funniest one was, there's one part, like in the middle of the show, where he's doing a ballad.

299
00:24:12,127 --> 00:24:15,728
[SPEAKER_26]: So normally what any singer does, he grabs some lucky woman off the stage and

300
00:24:16,209 --> 00:24:16,949
[SPEAKER_26]: He's going to serenade her.

301
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:19,610
[SPEAKER_26]: So he looks around and he points out this one gal in the crowd.

302
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:23,691
[SPEAKER_26]: And when you see this gal, like the spotlight's going on her, she's like totally freaking out.

303
00:24:24,011 --> 00:24:28,492
[SPEAKER_26]: She's, you know, you just look at her face because they put the, you know, camera on the projection screen.

304
00:24:28,952 --> 00:24:34,614
[SPEAKER_26]: And I can say from the time she got picked to the time she got off stage, you did not see her smile once.

305
00:24:34,934 --> 00:24:39,575
[SPEAKER_26]: She was too busy, totally like freaking out, making the sad face like, like, I don't know.

306
00:24:39,595 --> 00:24:41,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe her vagina was, never mind.

307
00:24:43,867 --> 00:24:44,408
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

308
00:25:14,585 --> 00:25:19,307
[SPEAKER_26]: Seriously, but it's funny because now you see Usher get up on stage and he's like walking slowly, taking his time.

309
00:25:19,608 --> 00:25:22,009
[SPEAKER_26]: He gets up there, you know, he's got like a bouquet of flowers for her.

310
00:25:22,449 --> 00:25:28,852
[SPEAKER_26]: And you can like, when the camera zooms in on her, you can see her face, she's like mouthing I love you to her, you know, to him, which is pretty standard.

311
00:25:29,273 --> 00:25:30,193
[SPEAKER_26]: Any fan would do that.

312
00:25:30,213 --> 00:25:32,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know I would.

313
00:25:32,314 --> 00:25:38,557
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, and then so finally, like just somewhere around the part where, you know, he's talking about, you know, I'll get down with you and all that kind of stuff, where he's singing that.

314
00:25:39,238 --> 00:25:41,219
[SPEAKER_26]: I swear to God, I'll put $20 on this.

315
00:25:41,259 --> 00:25:43,600
[SPEAKER_26]: You can ask Mike, you can ask Little B who saw this.

316
00:25:44,048 --> 00:25:46,649
[SPEAKER_26]: I swear she mouthed the words, I'll let you fuck me.

317
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:52,831
[SPEAKER_26]: I was just like, damn.

318
00:25:53,571 --> 00:25:55,772
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, there's just some whores in this world, I guess.

319
00:25:55,872 --> 00:25:59,333
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, I know if it's an Usher concert and a girl says it to a guy, he's flattered.

320
00:25:59,353 --> 00:26:03,254
[SPEAKER_26]: I know if Beyonce pulled me on stage and I pulled that, I'd be out in cuffs in like three seconds.

321
00:26:03,935 --> 00:26:05,695
[SPEAKER_26]: So, I just found that kind of curious.

322
00:26:05,795 --> 00:26:07,216
[SPEAKER_26]: But overall, it was pretty fun.

323
00:26:07,616 --> 00:26:08,196
[SPEAKER_26]: And then, um...

324
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:13,445
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, today it's just been coming up from the bay up to Sacto and hanging out with you guys.

325
00:26:13,586 --> 00:26:14,987
[SPEAKER_26]: And the fun's only just begun.

326
00:26:15,147 --> 00:26:15,548
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

327
00:26:15,588 --> 00:26:17,290
[SPEAKER_04]: We always appreciate it when you come and hang out.

328
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:19,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's always a good excuse to go have Mongolian barbecue as well.

329
00:26:20,193 --> 00:26:20,493
[SPEAKER_26]: Always.

330
00:26:21,194 --> 00:26:25,439
[SPEAKER_26]: And before I pass the mic, I just want to say what's up to the chat room, especially up to Sigurd and Kyle.

331
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,140
[SPEAKER_26]: Word.

332
00:26:26,604 --> 00:26:27,184
[SPEAKER_04]: I got mad loves for you.

333
00:26:27,264 --> 00:26:30,306
[SPEAKER_04]: And even though my new office mate is still psycho, I still hold a little place in my heart for you.

334
00:26:30,326 --> 00:26:32,567
[SPEAKER_04]: And I still have a Silent Hill 4 poster if you come back.

335
00:26:32,587 --> 00:26:33,607
[SPEAKER_04]: If I gotta bribe you, I'll bribe you, man.

336
00:26:33,627 --> 00:26:34,548
[SPEAKER_04]: How's your tip jar doing?

337
00:26:56,272 --> 00:26:56,652
[SPEAKER_26]: We are over $30.

338
00:26:58,073 --> 00:26:59,554
[SPEAKER_26]: Where the hell is all this money coming from?

339
00:26:59,954 --> 00:27:08,560
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, well, I explained it a little earlier in the DDR Freak Boards, but the short of it was essentially... Me and Sigurd, we used to have a bunch of stuff in our cube.

340
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:13,743
[SPEAKER_26]: Like, if you saw the first montage we ever did, we had, like, red vines, we had, like, granola bars and all that stuff.

341
00:27:14,103 --> 00:27:15,344
[SPEAKER_26]: And so our boss came in... The clue?

342
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,185
[SPEAKER_14]: Clue?

343
00:27:16,265 --> 00:27:16,785
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

344
00:27:16,825 --> 00:27:18,386
[SPEAKER_26]: Clues, quote.

345
00:27:18,966 --> 00:27:20,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I wanted to ask you real fast.

346
00:27:20,808 --> 00:27:24,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you want to issue, like, a formal apology to the users of DDR Freak Boards?

347
00:27:25,273 --> 00:27:25,854
[SPEAKER_04]: for what you did.

348
00:27:26,294 --> 00:27:27,215
[SPEAKER_26]: I will say this.

349
00:27:28,536 --> 00:27:30,178
[SPEAKER_26]: You guys totally assumed it was a clue.

350
00:27:30,358 --> 00:27:33,260
[SPEAKER_26]: I only said, which of these would you like to have right about now?

351
00:27:35,302 --> 00:27:36,263
[SPEAKER_26]: I didn't mean to lead you on.

352
00:27:36,303 --> 00:27:37,184
[SPEAKER_26]: You led yourselves.

353
00:27:37,985 --> 00:27:39,066
[SPEAKER_26]: That's your own damn fault.

354
00:27:39,106 --> 00:27:42,549
[SPEAKER_26]: I was going to tell you not to apologize, but... Yeah, that's their own damn fault.

355
00:27:42,949 --> 00:27:45,972
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried to say about the inkblot thing, but nobody listens to Scott.

356
00:27:46,052 --> 00:27:46,693
[SPEAKER_26]: I know, man.

357
00:27:46,713 --> 00:27:49,235
[SPEAKER_26]: You're the third eye of, you know, DDR Freak up in this piece.

358
00:27:50,136 --> 00:27:50,536
[SPEAKER_26]: That's alright.

359
00:27:50,596 --> 00:27:51,037
[SPEAKER_26]: But, um...

360
00:27:51,881 --> 00:27:52,922
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh gosh, where was I at?

361
00:27:52,962 --> 00:28:00,230
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, so the story was we had a bunch of stuff and then our boss came in one day on a Friday afternoon and saw that we had a bunch of granola bars.

362
00:28:00,591 --> 00:28:06,758
[SPEAKER_26]: And so he just kind of walked up to us, not saying a word, grabbed about three granola bars, dropped a dollar on the table and just walked off.

363
00:28:07,178 --> 00:28:09,401
[SPEAKER_26]: We were like, what the hell did he just do?

364
00:28:10,132 --> 00:28:12,613
[SPEAKER_26]: We were just thinking for the rest of the day, wow, that was kind of freaky.

365
00:28:12,853 --> 00:28:23,355
[SPEAKER_26]: And he comes back to us later and tells us, well, he was doing interviews all day for people coming to Konami, and he just didn't have time to go on a lunch break, and so he figured, well, hey, the testers have food.

366
00:28:23,715 --> 00:28:30,597
[SPEAKER_26]: So he just grabbed some from us and dropped the dollar as just payment for, well, I don't want to feel like I'm mooching.

367
00:28:30,977 --> 00:28:34,358
[SPEAKER_26]: And then just people started picking up on it, and then what started out as like $1.82 came into...

368
00:28:37,221 --> 00:28:39,822
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I single-handedly put $2.50 in that jar.

369
00:28:40,162 --> 00:28:47,204
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, you did, and Sharkskull put in her tip as well, and she don't even work there, so just the fact that people are... What exactly is she tipping?

370
00:28:48,645 --> 00:28:49,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Never mind, never mind.

371
00:28:51,766 --> 00:28:53,146
[SPEAKER_26]: It's not a burning you-know-what.

372
00:28:54,167 --> 00:28:55,247
[SPEAKER_26]: No comment.

373
00:28:59,068 --> 00:29:02,009
[SPEAKER_26]: But yeah, that is a week in the life of moi.

374
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:04,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, sounds good.

375
00:29:05,603 --> 00:29:06,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Sharks, girl.

376
00:29:07,324 --> 00:29:07,965
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi.

377
00:29:08,225 --> 00:29:09,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, long time no see.

378
00:29:10,307 --> 00:29:15,711
[SPEAKER_16]: Since like, what, a couple weeks ago on the great mini-golfing expedition?

379
00:29:15,911 --> 00:29:17,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that was beautiful.

380
00:29:17,993 --> 00:29:24,578
[SPEAKER_04]: The night we weren't allowed to go to the Konami dinner, we were excommunicated from the dinner, so we had to go miniature golfing at Miggle.

381
00:29:24,598 --> 00:29:29,021
[SPEAKER_16]: Although I have to say, Mel and I went miniature golfing in Santa Cruz last week, and I beat him by one.

382
00:29:29,441 --> 00:29:30,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job.

383
00:29:30,182 --> 00:29:31,343
[SPEAKER_16]: Pretty freaking proud of myself.

384
00:29:31,463 --> 00:29:33,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Although I would like to remind you that I did school you at Miggle.

385
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:35,791
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever, bitch.

386
00:29:37,972 --> 00:29:38,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

387
00:29:38,852 --> 00:29:40,313
[SPEAKER_16]: I was just letting you win.

388
00:29:40,333 --> 00:29:42,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I see.

389
00:29:42,374 --> 00:29:43,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, she let me win.

390
00:29:43,295 --> 00:29:43,955
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you guys hear that?

391
00:29:43,975 --> 00:29:44,895
[SPEAKER_04]: She let me win.

392
00:29:47,517 --> 00:29:48,837
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, them's fighting words, huh?

393
00:29:48,957 --> 00:29:49,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-huh.

394
00:29:51,579 --> 00:29:53,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so what else did you do this week?

395
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:53,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything exciting?

396
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:58,335
[SPEAKER_16]: I worked, which is more so suited for the FUs of the week.

397
00:29:58,775 --> 00:29:59,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

398
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:04,896
[SPEAKER_16]: And then I woke up yesterday thinking, I'm going to have a wonderful Saturday, and realized I could not turn my head to the right or the left.

399
00:30:05,756 --> 00:30:06,196
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, no.

400
00:30:06,256 --> 00:30:09,337
[SPEAKER_16]: So, my neck's been kind of sucked sore, and it still hurts.

401
00:30:09,377 --> 00:30:10,857
[SPEAKER_16]: That's why I let Mel drive up here.

402
00:30:11,658 --> 00:30:15,018
[SPEAKER_16]: And, yeah, I've just been kind of like, hmm, yay, pain.

403
00:30:15,378 --> 00:30:17,359
[SPEAKER_16]: Back medicines are your friend, although they make me sleep.

404
00:30:18,259 --> 00:30:21,179
[SPEAKER_16]: So, I've just been kind of really out of it, even for me.

405
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:22,860
[SPEAKER_13]: Hmm, cry.

406
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:23,620
[SPEAKER_16]: So...

407
00:30:24,468 --> 00:30:26,530
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll go back to work and I'll have an excuse for being a bitch.

408
00:30:30,132 --> 00:30:32,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Any shoutouts or anything you want to plug while you're here?

409
00:30:33,735 --> 00:30:36,097
[SPEAKER_16]: I am now addicted to Mario vs. Donkey Kong.

410
00:30:37,538 --> 00:30:39,760
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a game I could not get into for some reason.

411
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,601
[SPEAKER_16]: I just played it for five minutes.

412
00:30:41,661 --> 00:30:43,723
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm like, I must buy this game.

413
00:30:43,743 --> 00:30:46,505
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know why, it just didn't... Mario vs. Donkey Kong.

414
00:30:49,687 --> 00:30:50,988
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, she's handing me the Game Boy again.

415
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:54,933
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, except Mel just dropped it.

416
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:56,314
[SPEAKER_04]: Angel comes prepared.

417
00:30:56,774 --> 00:30:57,494
[SPEAKER_16]: That's right.

418
00:30:58,374 --> 00:30:59,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else you want to share?

419
00:30:59,795 --> 00:31:00,635
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I'm boring.

420
00:31:01,215 --> 00:31:01,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Fine.

421
00:31:01,915 --> 00:31:02,255
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you're not.

422
00:31:02,275 --> 00:31:02,755
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not boring.

423
00:31:03,635 --> 00:31:04,096
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm boring.

424
00:31:04,176 --> 00:31:05,416
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, I have to pull the joke now.

425
00:31:05,516 --> 00:31:08,317
[SPEAKER_04]: If I didn't have this show, I would be like the most boring man in the world.

426
00:31:08,437 --> 00:31:08,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Angel.

427
00:31:09,057 --> 00:31:11,497
[SPEAKER_19]: I was going to say, okay, I must pull the joke now.

428
00:31:11,557 --> 00:31:13,798
[SPEAKER_19]: Do you realize you have all three Mels on the couch?

429
00:31:15,138 --> 00:31:15,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's a good point.

430
00:31:16,178 --> 00:31:16,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

431
00:31:16,979 --> 00:31:18,319
[SPEAKER_04]: But people don't know your real name.

432
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:19,359
[SPEAKER_04]: You just gave it away, Angel.

433
00:31:19,959 --> 00:31:21,100
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, hey, hey, hey.

434
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,200
[SPEAKER_19]: It's only the first three letters.

435
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,140
[SPEAKER_19]: They can guess the rest.

436
00:31:24,116 --> 00:31:25,057
[SPEAKER_19]: No, nobody started guessing.

437
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:25,537
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

438
00:31:26,078 --> 00:31:26,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

439
00:31:27,118 --> 00:31:28,259
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, I'm Mel.

440
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:29,080
[SPEAKER_26]: No.

441
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,021
[SPEAKER_26]: No, I'm not.

442
00:31:30,101 --> 00:31:32,122
[SPEAKER_04]: No, he's Float Walk, remember?

443
00:31:32,703 --> 00:31:33,944
[SPEAKER_04]: Float Walk.

444
00:31:34,044 --> 00:31:34,564
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, see?

445
00:31:35,085 --> 00:31:35,905
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, how was your week?

446
00:31:35,925 --> 00:31:38,367
[SPEAKER_06]: How was your day?

447
00:31:38,908 --> 00:31:43,591
[SPEAKER_06]: My day would have been better if my shit didn't crap out on me.

448
00:31:43,611 --> 00:31:44,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Shit crap out on you?

449
00:31:44,292 --> 00:31:45,613
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate it when my shit craps.

450
00:31:47,875 --> 00:31:50,197
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm talking very vague.

451
00:31:50,277 --> 00:31:50,537
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean...

452
00:31:50,967 --> 00:31:54,008
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm talking about the little board that I had for my cabinet.

453
00:31:54,448 --> 00:31:57,450
[SPEAKER_06]: Not necessarily a main one because, you know, I didn't play with that today.

454
00:31:57,570 --> 00:32:03,172
[SPEAKER_06]: I got my smaller one that I was using for main before, but it's now being used for everything else.

455
00:32:03,532 --> 00:32:05,153
[SPEAKER_06]: Crapped out, and I don't know why.

456
00:32:06,393 --> 00:32:09,054
[SPEAKER_06]: Might have something to do with my shitty soldering job to fix it.

457
00:32:09,854 --> 00:32:11,475
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that might have something to do with it.

458
00:32:11,595 --> 00:32:12,576
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have to get a new one.

459
00:32:12,816 --> 00:32:13,436
[SPEAKER_06]: That sucks.

460
00:32:13,816 --> 00:32:15,577
[SPEAKER_06]: But at least it'll be nice and brand new.

461
00:32:16,077 --> 00:32:16,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

462
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:19,972
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we did get to play a little bit of DDR today.

463
00:32:19,992 --> 00:32:23,394
[SPEAKER_06]: I had it set up so we could play and it was pretty.

464
00:32:24,395 --> 00:32:28,919
[SPEAKER_06]: And my pads worked really well, but they're loud still, so that sucked.

465
00:32:29,259 --> 00:32:34,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Then yesterday we went to play QZAR and that rocked because, of course, I kicked ass anyways.

466
00:32:35,744 --> 00:32:37,285
[SPEAKER_06]: I kicked ass without even effort.

467
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:38,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Without effort.

468
00:32:38,647 --> 00:32:42,610
[SPEAKER_06]: I was actually spinning around on my ass in the middle of the arena shooting people.

469
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:45,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Behind my back, all that kind of cool stuff.

470
00:32:46,944 --> 00:32:47,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I rock.

471
00:32:47,785 --> 00:32:57,172
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, and then I tried playing DDR on doubles and stuff at the arcade, and I realized I have no more endurance anymore.

472
00:32:57,252 --> 00:32:57,953
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just gone.

473
00:32:58,353 --> 00:33:01,095
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, I felt like I was going to die.

474
00:33:01,655 --> 00:33:06,959
[SPEAKER_06]: And, yeah, my feet hurt a lot from all the walking from playing QZR.

475
00:33:06,979 --> 00:33:08,020
[SPEAKER_06]: That kind of sucked, too.

476
00:33:09,041 --> 00:33:10,042
[SPEAKER_06]: And since...

477
00:33:10,871 --> 00:33:12,932
[SPEAKER_06]: The girlfriend and sister aren't here.

478
00:33:13,373 --> 00:33:15,414
[SPEAKER_06]: The thing that I thought was haunted is not haunted.

479
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:16,335
[SPEAKER_06]: I wasted my money.

480
00:33:16,395 --> 00:33:16,895
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm an idiot.

481
00:33:18,616 --> 00:33:20,897
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all we need to know.

482
00:33:21,638 --> 00:33:24,540
[SPEAKER_06]: And that sucked.

483
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:31,164
[SPEAKER_06]: For those who were listening Wednesday, I bought a haunted doll off the internet, supposedly.

484
00:33:32,625 --> 00:33:33,826
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, whatever, it wasn't.

485
00:33:33,906 --> 00:33:34,526
[SPEAKER_06]: So that sucked.

486
00:33:35,127 --> 00:33:35,867
[SPEAKER_06]: And I hate it.

487
00:33:36,367 --> 00:33:36,908
[SPEAKER_06]: Woo, food!

488
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:39,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Aww.

489
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:41,120
[SPEAKER_06]: No food.

490
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,141
[SPEAKER_06]: And a new guest.

491
00:33:44,161 --> 00:33:45,681
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but anyways, yeah, so that was that.

492
00:33:45,801 --> 00:33:46,961
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, for that.

493
00:33:47,081 --> 00:33:52,363
[SPEAKER_06]: But, um, oh, and I made a CD, my CD, for my remixes and stuff.

494
00:33:53,403 --> 00:33:55,483
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, yeah.

495
00:33:56,203 --> 00:33:58,724
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty much all that I did this week, I think.

496
00:33:58,784 --> 00:33:59,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and a lot of Final Fantasy.

497
00:34:01,144 --> 00:34:04,725
[SPEAKER_04]: And Loki will be giving away copies of his CD to some of our in-studio guests tonight.

498
00:34:04,785 --> 00:34:05,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Won't that be exciting?

499
00:34:07,266 --> 00:34:07,566
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

500
00:34:08,426 --> 00:34:08,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh...

501
00:34:09,105 --> 00:34:10,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Who else wants to play How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day?

502
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:12,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Jonas, hello, thank you for joining us.

503
00:34:13,769 --> 00:34:14,329
[SPEAKER_27]: Hey, what up, y'all?

504
00:34:14,489 --> 00:34:15,650
[SPEAKER_04]: How was your week, how was your day?

505
00:34:17,371 --> 00:34:17,992
[SPEAKER_27]: Ups and downs.

506
00:34:18,312 --> 00:34:20,114
[SPEAKER_27]: The ups was the tournament being okay.

507
00:34:20,954 --> 00:34:22,235
[SPEAKER_27]: Give us the candy a good time.

508
00:34:22,576 --> 00:34:24,097
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, I completely forgot about that.

509
00:34:24,137 --> 00:34:24,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah!

510
00:34:25,031 --> 00:34:25,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

511
00:34:44,358 --> 00:34:46,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Back to School Bash Back to School Bash

512
00:34:58,207 --> 00:34:59,988
[SPEAKER_04]: Mel wanted to share something about the tournament.

513
00:35:00,268 --> 00:35:00,729
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, float.

514
00:35:00,929 --> 00:35:07,073
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm just saying, if it was a back-to-school tournament, why weren't they giving away some cool prizes like some Trapper Keepers?

515
00:35:07,293 --> 00:35:08,174
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah!

516
00:35:08,554 --> 00:35:10,035
[SPEAKER_20]: DDR Trapper Keepers!

517
00:35:10,995 --> 00:35:14,978
[SPEAKER_16]: If it was a back-to-school tournament, why were they holding it on a school night?

518
00:35:15,418 --> 00:35:16,139
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no, no.

519
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:18,080
[SPEAKER_06]: The Trapper Keeper is bad news.

520
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,401
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we saw South Park.

521
00:35:19,421 --> 00:35:21,302
[SPEAKER_06]: We know what can happen with Trapper Keepers.

522
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:25,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they could give away Butterfly Binders.

523
00:35:28,996 --> 00:35:29,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Kill me.

524
00:35:31,778 --> 00:35:34,000
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was actually surprised at the turnout for a Tuesday night.

525
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:34,480
[SPEAKER_04]: I really was.

526
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:37,983
[SPEAKER_04]: But a bunch of people I didn't know, and it was interesting.

527
00:35:38,364 --> 00:35:40,686
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, new faces I didn't even know as well.

528
00:35:41,146 --> 00:35:46,230
[SPEAKER_06]: So was the money raised from this thing to go towards making their marquee look non-ghetto?

529
00:35:46,691 --> 00:35:49,733
[SPEAKER_06]: Because their marquee is pretty crap.

530
00:35:50,434 --> 00:35:50,654
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean...

531
00:35:51,365 --> 00:35:56,288
[SPEAKER_06]: It looked like, you know, I'm gonna glue stuff to a piece of wood, and it'll be our marquee.

532
00:35:57,168 --> 00:36:02,611
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, they're using the money to actually build the actual Scandia place, like the paths to be better, the speakers.

533
00:36:04,352 --> 00:36:07,494
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe they can not spend it on more skee-ball machines.

534
00:36:07,914 --> 00:36:13,477
[SPEAKER_06]: My god, they have like eight skee-ball machines in there in the shooting gallery.

535
00:36:13,697 --> 00:36:16,299
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe they can use it to dismantle the damn shooting gallery.

536
00:36:17,571 --> 00:36:19,373
[SPEAKER_06]: Shooting galleries are fun to annoy people.

537
00:36:19,574 --> 00:36:21,577
[SPEAKER_18]: Dude, the shooting galleries suck.

538
00:36:22,077 --> 00:36:27,225
[SPEAKER_18]: My whole reason for going to Scandia had DVD drive failure.

539
00:36:27,245 --> 00:36:30,009
[SPEAKER_18]: They're sending it to Reno.

540
00:36:30,029 --> 00:36:30,510
[SPEAKER_18]: It's gone.

541
00:36:31,231 --> 00:36:31,752
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gone.

542
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:35,300
[SPEAKER_18]: Damn it!

543
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so we had the little tournament.

544
00:36:37,461 --> 00:36:42,424
[SPEAKER_04]: I dropped in for about 45 minutes, and I was pissed off because they weren't doing freestyle, and I was going to do an exhibition freestyle.

545
00:36:43,004 --> 00:36:46,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Dick was going to come out and do Sexy Planet, but I got denied.

546
00:36:47,987 --> 00:36:55,310
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had my hoes and everything, and I had my uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh part all figured out.

547
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:56,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Denied.

548
00:36:57,552 --> 00:36:58,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Stupid Scandia.

549
00:36:58,432 --> 00:37:01,554
[SPEAKER_04]: I am a total dance attention whore when it comes to freestyle tournaments.

550
00:37:02,074 --> 00:37:03,895
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't wait for Spiggle 3, that's all I have to say.

551
00:37:04,452 --> 00:37:08,195
[SPEAKER_27]: They actually gave me some news towards how they're going to do tournaments and stuff for Scandia.

552
00:37:08,475 --> 00:37:09,937
[SPEAKER_27]: They're thinking about doing it every month.

553
00:37:11,578 --> 00:37:11,918
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, man.

554
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:12,879
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, I know, exactly.

555
00:37:13,379 --> 00:37:15,241
[SPEAKER_27]: Ding, ding, ding, oversaturation's calling.

556
00:37:17,142 --> 00:37:19,364
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway, anything else interesting happening this week?

557
00:37:19,985 --> 00:37:25,069
[SPEAKER_27]: I got another contact from someone who has organized Madden tournaments and various other video game tournaments.

558
00:37:25,489 --> 00:37:27,330
[SPEAKER_27]: They're thinking about getting to the DDR scene as well.

559
00:37:27,771 --> 00:37:28,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

560
00:37:28,932 --> 00:37:30,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, DDR and Madden are so much alike.

561
00:37:31,994 --> 00:37:32,455
Okay.

562
00:37:33,419 --> 00:37:34,920
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm teasing, but that's cool.

563
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:40,764
[SPEAKER_27]: There's a tournament of Madden and Tuesday and Steve Space Pizza in the marketplace.

564
00:37:40,804 --> 00:37:46,428
[SPEAKER_04]: There's been kind of an over, I mean, I'm sorry, there's been a lack, actually, of really big tournaments lately.

565
00:37:46,448 --> 00:37:49,290
[SPEAKER_04]: In the past few months, big tournaments, there haven't been a whole lot.

566
00:37:49,651 --> 00:37:53,754
[SPEAKER_04]: But I kind of fear that this December is looking to be almost a little oversaturated.

567
00:37:54,034 --> 00:37:58,457
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard of a lot of different things going on, so just be careful, check out the calendar.

568
00:37:59,361 --> 00:38:05,286
[SPEAKER_04]: We all know everybody has an eye on DDR Freaks Tournament Forum, so just check them out.

569
00:38:05,406 --> 00:38:11,211
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, then you've got SVGL3, you've got B3 Part 2, I'm not sure when the hell that's going to turn out.

570
00:38:12,252 --> 00:38:16,176
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, okay, or FU2 next year.

571
00:38:18,057 --> 00:38:18,277
[SPEAKER_27]: FU2!

572
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:18,878
[SPEAKER_27]: FU2, buddy!

573
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:21,300
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

574
00:38:22,165 --> 00:38:24,186
[SPEAKER_27]: The Sacktown Smackdown, that's the subtitle.

575
00:38:24,566 --> 00:38:25,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Jesus.

576
00:38:25,567 --> 00:38:26,307
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, all right.

577
00:38:27,248 --> 00:38:29,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, anything else you wanted to share about your weekday day?

578
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:34,332
[SPEAKER_27]: Except someone threw a damn beer bottle at my head.

579
00:38:34,352 --> 00:38:35,652
[SPEAKER_27]: For what?

580
00:38:35,712 --> 00:38:37,373
[SPEAKER_27]: I was like, whoo!

581
00:38:38,894 --> 00:38:39,454
[SPEAKER_04]: What'd you do?

582
00:38:40,175 --> 00:38:41,696
[SPEAKER_27]: No, I didn't say anything.

583
00:38:41,936 --> 00:38:42,836
[SPEAKER_27]: They thought I flicked them off.

584
00:38:42,856 --> 00:38:45,358
[SPEAKER_27]: I was like, hello.

585
00:38:45,378 --> 00:38:46,638
[SPEAKER_27]: You were waving at somebody?

586
00:38:46,918 --> 00:38:47,539
[SPEAKER_27]: Hello!

587
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:49,580
[SPEAKER_04]: And they threw a beer bottle at you?

588
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,401
[SPEAKER_14]: I was like, oh, shit.

589
00:38:53,634 --> 00:38:54,934
[SPEAKER_04]: My god, people can be rude.

590
00:38:56,875 --> 00:39:01,496
[SPEAKER_16]: Wait a second, he was driving and someone threw a beer bottle at him.

591
00:39:01,996 --> 00:39:03,436
[SPEAKER_16]: What's wrong with this picture?

592
00:39:03,456 --> 00:39:07,177
[SPEAKER_27]: I was like, woohoo!

593
00:39:07,197 --> 00:39:09,317
[SPEAKER_27]: But then, oh shit!

594
00:39:13,258 --> 00:39:14,938
[SPEAKER_04]: You lead a very interesting life.

595
00:39:15,378 --> 00:39:16,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Explosive, that's all I have to say.

596
00:39:17,198 --> 00:39:17,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

597
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:19,899
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, somewhat, yeah.

598
00:39:20,697 --> 00:39:21,257
[SPEAKER_04]: My Week and My Day

599
00:39:51,229 --> 00:39:52,410
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, I had a lot of fun.

600
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:55,052
[SPEAKER_04]: And I actually played a game of DDR, believe it or not.

601
00:39:55,412 --> 00:39:59,294
[SPEAKER_04]: I played a game of Extreme, and this was my set on DDR Extreme, okay?

602
00:39:59,675 --> 00:40:06,039
[SPEAKER_04]: I played I Believe in Miracles and Make It Better from DDR First Mix.

603
00:40:06,359 --> 00:40:08,201
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I played another second mix song.

604
00:40:08,221 --> 00:40:09,902
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I played Let's Get Down or something.

605
00:40:10,262 --> 00:40:12,824
[SPEAKER_04]: I made it an all second mix and first mix night.

606
00:40:12,904 --> 00:40:13,544
[SPEAKER_04]: It was awesome.

607
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:15,726
[SPEAKER_04]: I miss my old DDR mixes.

608
00:40:16,926 --> 00:40:17,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway...

609
00:40:19,639 --> 00:40:27,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Also tonight, I don't know if you caught a glimpse of me on the webcam earlier, but I'm dressed in all black because I'm going out to a goth club after the show.

610
00:40:28,221 --> 00:40:28,882
[SPEAKER_04]: That should be fun.

611
00:40:29,382 --> 00:40:30,042
[SPEAKER_18]: You goth.

612
00:40:31,502 --> 00:40:32,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you know I'm so gothic.

613
00:40:33,043 --> 00:40:35,183
[SPEAKER_18]: That's so wrong.

614
00:40:35,203 --> 00:40:37,524
[SPEAKER_04]: This is pretty much what it's going to sound like at the goth club.

615
00:40:37,564 --> 00:40:40,105
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, wow.

616
00:40:40,545 --> 00:40:41,365
[SPEAKER_13]: The lights.

617
00:40:43,145 --> 00:40:45,186
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm so tragic.

618
00:40:47,701 --> 00:40:50,102
[SPEAKER_13]: I need another clove of cigarettes.

619
00:40:56,486 --> 00:40:57,246
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just teasing.

620
00:40:57,366 --> 00:41:02,709
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just hoping that somebody I know is listening to that so he'll kick my ass when, you know, I go out later.

621
00:41:02,989 --> 00:41:03,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

622
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:08,052
[SPEAKER_18]: I didn't... I... Okay.

623
00:41:10,373 --> 00:41:11,354
[SPEAKER_18]: You know where I'm from.

624
00:41:12,034 --> 00:41:15,396
[SPEAKER_18]: And you know that damn near everybody I hung out with was like uber goth.

625
00:41:15,456 --> 00:41:15,736
[SPEAKER_29]: Right.

626
00:41:16,517 --> 00:41:16,817
[SPEAKER_18]: You know.

627
00:41:17,501 --> 00:41:20,882
[SPEAKER_18]: But I never imagined that there would be like a club.

628
00:41:21,302 --> 00:41:21,723
[SPEAKER_18]: What do you do?

629
00:41:21,763 --> 00:41:23,183
[SPEAKER_18]: Go around and just be depressed?

630
00:41:23,543 --> 00:41:28,225
[SPEAKER_18]: And wave your hands around like you're trying to bat the ghosts away from you?

631
00:41:29,426 --> 00:41:34,227
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm so gothic that when the night comes, so do I.

632
00:41:36,395 --> 00:41:44,480
[SPEAKER_06]: They fucking play industrial synth-pop, that kind of stuff.

633
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,441
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really good stuff.

634
00:41:45,581 --> 00:41:47,142
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually like the music at that.

635
00:41:47,182 --> 00:42:01,551
[SPEAKER_06]: I went once, and then I got... I was with one of my friends who's in this goth stuff, and this one guy wanted to take me home and have sex, and he was dressed up in some sort of...

636
00:42:04,508 --> 00:42:05,809
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, it was just wrong.

637
00:42:05,889 --> 00:42:09,130
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, I don't know how many times I've had to apologize for that, Loki.

638
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:15,512
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry to do that to you, but... I just don't... If your life is so tragic, why would you dance about it?

639
00:42:16,172 --> 00:42:16,853
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

640
00:42:17,013 --> 00:42:17,193
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

641
00:42:17,353 --> 00:42:18,813
[SPEAKER_04]: In reality, it's actually a lot of fun.

642
00:42:19,814 --> 00:42:22,955
[SPEAKER_04]: If I didn't enjoy it, I wouldn't pay a whole $4 to get in the door.

643
00:42:23,055 --> 00:42:24,596
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I'm looking forward to it.

644
00:42:24,616 --> 00:42:26,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I actually haven't been in like two years.

645
00:42:26,576 --> 00:42:28,497
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a lot of fun people to go.

646
00:42:28,537 --> 00:42:29,337
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all about the people.

647
00:42:30,578 --> 00:42:30,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

648
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:33,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on...

649
00:42:33,544 --> 00:42:35,545
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to give you a little bit of help.

650
00:43:03,178 --> 00:43:14,283
[SPEAKER_04]: and Floatwalk has gotten a clue relayed to him from Dancer X, the mysterious Dancer X, but Floatwalk talks to him, so you're special.

651
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:21,345
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we've gotten some things here, so maybe just these first two bits here we'll give away for right now.

652
00:43:21,826 --> 00:43:30,069
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, well, it's pretty obvious so far no one has answered the question correct yet, although I will say I have seen some very close...

653
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:31,842
[SPEAKER_26]: answers on there.

654
00:43:31,882 --> 00:43:40,088
[SPEAKER_26]: And as I mentioned before, a lot of people are trying to, I guess, sort of think that the song is three steps away from what you literally see.

655
00:43:40,328 --> 00:43:41,529
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, it's actually right there.

656
00:43:41,709 --> 00:43:43,550
[SPEAKER_26]: It's a little more literal than you think.

657
00:43:43,911 --> 00:43:52,257
[SPEAKER_26]: But also, if you read Dancer X's post, he said in there that it is a new song.

658
00:43:52,477 --> 00:43:54,639
[SPEAKER_26]: It's something that has never been on DDR before.

659
00:43:55,179 --> 00:43:58,762
[SPEAKER_26]: So that should narrow down some of the ideas that you had.

660
00:43:59,722 --> 00:44:02,544
[SPEAKER_26]: and, uh, hmm, do you think we should go ahead and give them the new clue yet?

661
00:44:03,165 --> 00:44:04,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, let's wait a little bit.

662
00:44:04,145 --> 00:44:06,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see if that new song thing helps them out a little bit.

663
00:44:06,627 --> 00:44:13,932
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a brand new song, and you guys, it was actually, in his original post, it was, like, the subject line, and you guys completely missed it.

664
00:44:13,972 --> 00:44:15,833
[SPEAKER_04]: But hey, you know, what can you do?

665
00:44:16,334 --> 00:44:17,634
[SPEAKER_04]: We can only hold your hand so far.

666
00:44:18,415 --> 00:44:23,058
[SPEAKER_04]: But, uh, if you have some guesses, uh, we'll be fielding guesses over private message a little later.

667
00:44:23,158 --> 00:44:25,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't just shout it out in the chat room, because we're not paying attention.

668
00:44:26,282 --> 00:44:28,904
[SPEAKER_04]: No, actually, we are paying attention, but we don't want to miss it.

669
00:44:28,964 --> 00:44:31,026
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why we like to field the guesses over private message.

670
00:44:31,426 --> 00:44:34,369
[SPEAKER_04]: So after the break, we'll take some more guesses.

671
00:44:34,709 --> 00:44:36,610
[SPEAKER_26]: And I'll even put it like this.

672
00:44:37,011 --> 00:44:41,234
[SPEAKER_26]: If someone can guess it just from the clues that I've given you, if you somehow pull it out.

673
00:44:41,977 --> 00:44:43,958
[SPEAKER_26]: I will guarantee you some cool Konami swag.

674
00:44:44,258 --> 00:44:45,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, swag!

675
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:46,680
[SPEAKER_26]: Speaking of swag.

676
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:47,180
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I guess?

677
00:44:48,081 --> 00:44:51,783
[SPEAKER_26]: We have a huge announcement on swag coming up for Orange Lounge later.

678
00:44:52,063 --> 00:44:54,405
[SPEAKER_26]: You will not want to miss this one.

679
00:44:54,505 --> 00:44:56,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Floatwalk's going to talk to us about this.

680
00:44:56,746 --> 00:44:58,527
[SPEAKER_04]: This is very exciting news for Orange Lounge Radio.

681
00:44:58,827 --> 00:45:00,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Floatwalk's going to tell us all about it right after the break.

682
00:45:01,389 --> 00:45:04,451
[SPEAKER_04]: And on this break, we're going to have three songs that all have a central theme.

683
00:45:04,811 --> 00:45:05,952
[SPEAKER_04]: You try and figure out what it is.

684
00:45:06,032 --> 00:45:06,512
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be back.

685
00:45:09,182 --> 00:45:11,424
I'm gonna show you how to burn

686
00:46:19,882 --> 00:46:20,283
and many more.

687
00:47:10,114 --> 00:47:11,014
Thank you for watching!

688
00:47:37,578 --> 00:47:38,699
Thanks for watching!

689
00:48:01,995 --> 00:48:03,096
Thanks for watching!

690
00:48:38,353 --> 00:48:40,397
I'm burning up for you

691
00:50:25,474 --> 00:50:31,336
[SPEAKER_30]: Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

692
00:50:35,718 --> 00:50:37,999
[SPEAKER_04]: We are back, Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 110.

693
00:50:38,279 --> 00:50:44,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we told you before the break that the clue has something to do with a new song, so...

694
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:46,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's your chance to give it another guess.

695
00:50:47,001 --> 00:50:50,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your guess.

696
00:50:50,543 --> 00:50:52,524
[SPEAKER_04]: If you get it right, you get to be the one to announce it.

697
00:50:52,764 --> 00:50:53,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh la la.

698
00:50:54,084 --> 00:50:58,307
[SPEAKER_04]: And you could even do that over the Skype line if you have access to that, our Skype line.

699
00:50:58,367 --> 00:51:04,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Just go to www.orangeontrader.com, click on interact with us, and get the information about the Skype line.

700
00:51:04,129 --> 00:51:05,450
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're looking for your guesses.

701
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:09,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Meanwhile, before we went to the break...

702
00:51:12,657 --> 00:51:16,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Floatwalk and I were teasing a little something that's coming up for Orange Lounge Radio.

703
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:20,162
[SPEAKER_04]: And Floatwalk, why don't you tell us a little more about what's going on?

704
00:51:20,242 --> 00:51:22,704
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought we had a third mic somewhere we can get for Jamie.

705
00:51:23,825 --> 00:51:24,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe?

706
00:51:24,526 --> 00:51:24,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe not.

707
00:51:24,906 --> 00:51:25,186
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

708
00:51:26,387 --> 00:51:26,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

709
00:51:29,129 --> 00:51:30,870
[SPEAKER_26]: So what were we just talking about?

710
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:32,131
[SPEAKER_04]: The giveaway that's coming up.

711
00:51:32,431 --> 00:51:33,112
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, yes, yes.

712
00:51:33,252 --> 00:51:33,492
[SPEAKER_26]: Well...

713
00:51:34,053 --> 00:51:42,297
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, as I've seen in Orange Lounge, I know there are a couple people that we hold in high regard in this realm of Bimani and such.

714
00:51:42,918 --> 00:51:45,879
[SPEAKER_04]: People who we'd like to sleep with is this list we have.

715
00:51:45,899 --> 00:51:46,339
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm kidding.

716
00:51:46,600 --> 00:52:02,448
[SPEAKER_26]: And atop that list, which I think holds true for quite a bunch of people, you know, figuratively and conceptually, or reality, we do have someone who has decided to donate us some swag, autographed swag no less,

717
00:52:03,121 --> 00:52:05,902
[SPEAKER_26]: and that person would be... Drumroll anyone?

718
00:52:06,422 --> 00:52:06,722
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

719
00:52:08,703 --> 00:52:10,503
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, we got clap on the clapper.

720
00:52:10,883 --> 00:52:11,824
[SPEAKER_26]: But that'll do.

721
00:52:12,564 --> 00:52:15,244
[SPEAKER_26]: And that person is... Akira Yamaoka.

722
00:52:15,585 --> 00:52:16,405
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, indeed.

723
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:27,534
[SPEAKER_26]: DDR Spot did the interview with Akira Yamaoka a couple of weeks ago when we posted it on DDR Spot.

724
00:52:28,215 --> 00:52:42,948
[SPEAKER_26]: He mentioned somewhere in the email that he would be willing to give out some swag to our listeners and to our readers at DDR Spot, and given the business relations between DDR Spot and Orange Lounge, I figured why not share the wealth with everybody, so...

725
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:46,351
[SPEAKER_26]: We do have a handful of CDs to give away.

726
00:52:46,792 --> 00:52:55,856
[SPEAKER_26]: How we will do that, we are still determining right now, but you will have to listen to not just Orange Lounge Radio on Sunday nights, but I think there's a little more attention you'll have to be paying.

727
00:52:56,796 --> 00:53:03,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we're cooking up a scheme right now on how we're going to give away the CDs, but we are very excited to be working with DDR Spot on this exciting giveaway.

728
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:08,282
[SPEAKER_04]: I know a lot of people out there want those CDs, so we're going to make it tough.

729
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:09,160
[SPEAKER_04]: More staff?

730
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:09,480
[SPEAKER_04]: More staff?

731
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:43,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Who'd be sucker enough to help you guys out?

732
00:53:44,102 --> 00:53:46,824
[SPEAKER_26]: People who like something different.

733
00:53:47,024 --> 00:53:59,732
[SPEAKER_26]: I'll say this as far as DDR Spot, one thing I do like to pump up about us is the fact that any kind of Konami news that breaks from the US side of things, no one's going to beat us to the punch.

734
00:54:00,496 --> 00:54:03,719
[SPEAKER_26]: Half the people who are on Spotstaff work there.

735
00:54:03,939 --> 00:54:09,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that difficult, having to have a DDR fan site, yet at the same time you work for Konami?

736
00:54:09,703 --> 00:54:15,107
[SPEAKER_04]: If you wanted to blow the lid on the whole Ultramix 2 song list, the Extreme Unlocks and all that stuff, you could do it.

737
00:54:15,788 --> 00:54:16,448
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh yeah, we absolutely could.

738
00:54:16,468 --> 00:54:17,889
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you could get sued, but you could do it.

739
00:54:18,170 --> 00:54:21,732
[SPEAKER_26]: We could do it, but at the same time, there's movies that you geek up over.

740
00:54:21,812 --> 00:54:25,335
[SPEAKER_26]: You don't want someone to tell you how it ends, word for word, verbatim.

741
00:54:25,612 --> 00:54:26,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you know what?

742
00:54:26,233 --> 00:54:28,955
[SPEAKER_04]: The boat sank and Darth is Luke's father.

743
00:54:29,095 --> 00:54:29,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, guys.

744
00:54:30,277 --> 00:54:30,937
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, essentially.

745
00:54:30,957 --> 00:54:34,941
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, just working for a while, it's like... And Jesus does die.

746
00:54:36,062 --> 00:54:37,323
[SPEAKER_04]: At the end, they hang Jesus.

747
00:54:38,004 --> 00:54:43,970
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, I mean, I think the best way of putting it... Wow, Jesus dies and laughter ensued.

748
00:54:45,424 --> 00:54:49,187
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry for the spoiler, guy, but Jesus does die at the end of that recent DVD release.

749
00:54:49,507 --> 00:54:49,787
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, yeah.

750
00:54:50,088 --> 00:54:57,173
[SPEAKER_26]: But the thing about, I guess, working there, like, the first day, obviously, you're surprised just as anybody to find out, you know, this news.

751
00:54:57,233 --> 00:55:02,938
[SPEAKER_26]: But then, once you start playing something for 40 hours a week, the novelty dies out after the 15th hour.

752
00:55:05,459 --> 00:55:10,944
[SPEAKER_26]: But I think we've gotten to the point where it's something, I mean, it's something we've all done before.

753
00:55:10,984 --> 00:55:15,127
[SPEAKER_26]: It's pretty standard nature to understand the nature of the beast, how people are on boards.

754
00:55:15,441 --> 00:55:22,169
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, obviously they're going to pester you for a clue here or there, but now that I work closer with the product managers and all the PR people,

755
00:55:22,577 --> 00:55:29,020
[SPEAKER_26]: I kind of know where my limits are and once those are drawn out, it's easy to hold on to those, stay within those boundaries.

756
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:35,423
[SPEAKER_04]: So speaking of limits, any other hints about things we could look forward to?

757
00:55:35,583 --> 00:55:38,685
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying guys, I'm trying to get something out of them.

758
00:55:39,025 --> 00:55:45,808
[SPEAKER_26]: I will say for Ultramix 2, SP7 will be ready when Ultramix 2 ships.

759
00:55:46,028 --> 00:55:46,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Right on.

760
00:55:46,468 --> 00:55:50,130
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, we already know what it is and there's new stuff on there.

761
00:55:50,450 --> 00:55:51,770
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, good.

762
00:55:51,910 --> 00:55:54,531
[SPEAKER_26]: So you're not just getting run-of-the-mill things.

763
00:55:56,692 --> 00:55:59,092
[SPEAKER_26]: The Xbox Live is going to be pretty awesome.

764
00:55:59,112 --> 00:56:00,472
[SPEAKER_26]: It's going to be more robust this time.

765
00:56:01,513 --> 00:56:04,173
[SPEAKER_26]: You've probably heard, obviously, you can trade edits online.

766
00:56:04,213 --> 00:56:05,434
[SPEAKER_26]: You can download step data.

767
00:56:06,054 --> 00:56:07,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Have they made an official announcement?

768
00:56:07,514 --> 00:56:10,975
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to say one way or the other, but have they made an official announcement about being able to play those edits?

769
00:56:11,015 --> 00:56:13,256
[SPEAKER_04]: I know there was a little bit of confusion about being able to play edits.

770
00:56:14,956 --> 00:56:17,017
[SPEAKER_26]: To, like, challenge someone online with the edits?

771
00:56:17,057 --> 00:56:17,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, with playing edits.

772
00:56:18,437 --> 00:56:18,617
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

773
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:20,471
[SPEAKER_26]: Quite honestly, I can't remember.

774
00:56:20,491 --> 00:56:23,373
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, there's so many things that go into, you know, like... Alright, alright.

775
00:56:23,453 --> 00:56:23,893
[SPEAKER_26]: It's cool.

776
00:56:24,013 --> 00:56:24,754
[SPEAKER_26]: It just slips me.

777
00:56:24,814 --> 00:56:25,554
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cool, it's cool.

778
00:56:25,795 --> 00:56:26,055
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

779
00:56:26,755 --> 00:56:29,477
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want you to say anything that's going to get you in trouble, so don't worry about it.

780
00:56:29,517 --> 00:56:30,658
[SPEAKER_26]: What else are things to expect?

781
00:56:31,078 --> 00:56:33,960
[SPEAKER_26]: A lot of people geeked up over DDR Extreme having a VRare.

782
00:56:34,821 --> 00:56:40,585
[SPEAKER_26]: I will say there is a high chance, not 100% sure, but there's a high chance we'll have a VRare number 4.

783
00:56:42,086 --> 00:56:42,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh!

784
00:56:42,606 --> 00:56:42,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

785
00:56:43,047 --> 00:56:43,867
[SPEAKER_26]: You heard that here first.

786
00:56:45,228 --> 00:56:46,489
[SPEAKER_04]: A VRare number 4?

787
00:56:46,589 --> 00:56:46,969
[SPEAKER_26]: Possibly.

788
00:56:47,350 --> 00:56:47,850
[SPEAKER_04]: How would that

789
00:56:48,368 --> 00:56:49,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, alright.

790
00:56:49,909 --> 00:56:51,450
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I see where this might be going.

791
00:56:51,530 --> 00:56:51,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

792
00:56:52,091 --> 00:56:53,792
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll leave it to our listeners to figure that one out.

793
00:56:54,432 --> 00:56:54,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

794
00:56:55,213 --> 00:56:55,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

795
00:56:56,674 --> 00:56:56,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

796
00:56:57,675 --> 00:57:03,058
[SPEAKER_26]: But other than that, I mean, Ultimix 2 is looking snazzy right now.

797
00:57:03,098 --> 00:57:09,343
[SPEAKER_26]: We're almost ready to send it off to Microsoft and just let them give us the good word.

798
00:57:09,903 --> 00:57:14,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I don't know if you can repeat any of this, but you were telling me some funny stories about working with Microsoft earlier.

799
00:57:14,907 --> 00:57:16,788
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if that's something you've got to keep on the down-low or...

800
00:57:18,019 --> 00:57:19,601
[SPEAKER_26]: No, actually, it's kind of fascinating.

801
00:57:19,661 --> 00:57:27,251
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, anyone who works in video games and does stuff with, like, Microsoft or Sony, there's actually standards you have to follow.

802
00:57:27,672 --> 00:57:36,223
[SPEAKER_26]: Like, funny thing is, things on the PlayStation controller, for example, you know those little analog sticks you have on the sides, you know, in the front of the controller?

803
00:57:36,584 --> 00:57:42,527
[SPEAKER_26]: They actually, like, anytime they're referred to in a game, they actually have to be called right analog stick or left analog stick.

804
00:57:42,567 --> 00:57:43,647
[SPEAKER_26]: You can't call them anything else.

805
00:57:43,987 --> 00:57:44,968
[SPEAKER_26]: Or you could call them L3, R3.

806
00:57:45,048 --> 00:57:50,810
[SPEAKER_26]: But if you say, like, yeah, in the instruction book, use the thumb stick, you would actually get zinged for it.

807
00:57:51,471 --> 00:57:52,771
[SPEAKER_04]: And what exactly is a zing?

808
00:57:52,791 --> 00:57:54,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that mean they come out and kick your ass or fine you?

809
00:57:54,932 --> 00:57:56,473
[SPEAKER_26]: They'll say, we're not going to ship your game.

810
00:57:56,553 --> 00:57:57,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my God.

811
00:57:58,634 --> 00:58:01,295
[SPEAKER_26]: There are some things they'll let slide, but there are some things they're pretty strict about.

812
00:58:01,515 --> 00:58:04,776
[SPEAKER_26]: And, like, just how you name your stuff is actually a big deal.

813
00:58:04,896 --> 00:58:05,957
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, not a big deal, but a semi.

814
00:58:05,977 --> 00:58:06,097
[SPEAKER_26]: Wow.

815
00:58:07,113 --> 00:58:07,653
[SPEAKER_04]: That's crazy.

816
00:58:08,113 --> 00:58:16,137
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, I mean, it's... When you work in QA and video games, there are things you have to test, like, you have to make sure your game can run 72 hours without crashing, you know?

817
00:58:16,517 --> 00:58:17,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my gosh.

818
00:58:17,177 --> 00:58:19,778
[SPEAKER_26]: There are things you have to do, like, you have to pull the controller... Driver 3 passed that.

819
00:58:20,538 --> 00:58:22,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, how did Driver 3 get through QA?

820
00:58:22,039 --> 00:58:22,819
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I want to know.

821
00:58:22,839 --> 00:58:24,440
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, you didn't go through Konami, that's for damn sure.

822
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:25,720
[SPEAKER_04]: That's for damn sure.

823
00:58:27,341 --> 00:58:34,704
[SPEAKER_26]: But yeah, it's an interesting beast, just, I mean, a lot of people think when you're in QA you have to play games, you know, you just play it ad nauseum, but...

824
00:58:35,049 --> 00:58:38,291
[SPEAKER_26]: You really, you know, you're supposed to sit there and you're supposed to break what you can.

825
00:58:38,912 --> 00:58:44,376
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, so anyone who's trying to get into the game industry, that's... You gotta learn how to break games, not how to play and break them.

826
00:58:46,077 --> 00:58:46,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, that's good.

827
00:58:47,038 --> 00:58:49,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Loki's very good at breaking games, I must say.

828
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:51,261
[SPEAKER_04]: And I broke Ultramix last night.

829
00:58:51,281 --> 00:59:02,349
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, I was telling you this earlier, I actually broke Ultramix, so... Something got through the cracks somehow, I don't know, but... Well, Ultramix was a half-rush job, but I mean...

830
00:59:02,884 --> 00:59:09,008
[SPEAKER_26]: Like any other game in the series, the first will always have flaws, which is why you come out with the sequel to correct.

831
00:59:09,128 --> 00:59:10,469
[SPEAKER_04]: It honestly wasn't a big deal.

832
00:59:10,529 --> 00:59:12,010
[SPEAKER_04]: I found it more amusing than anything else.

833
00:59:12,070 --> 00:59:13,290
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't piss me off or anything.

834
00:59:13,671 --> 00:59:16,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Besides, flaws in Microsoft products is nothing new.

835
00:59:20,135 --> 00:59:21,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Service Pack 2, anybody?

836
00:59:25,898 --> 00:59:27,059
[SPEAKER_26]: What else?

837
00:59:27,179 --> 00:59:31,802
[SPEAKER_26]: Most people know that a lot of the step data for new songs has been done by

838
00:59:32,301 --> 00:59:41,188
[SPEAKER_26]: Konami QA, I think people who, there's, you know, usually two people, people who like fun songs and people who like challenging songs, I think they're going to get a good variety of both.

839
00:59:41,789 --> 00:59:43,510
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very excited about Ultramix too.

840
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:48,594
[SPEAKER_04]: But something we haven't talked a whole lot about, DDR Extreme, it's just about out, it's almost there.

841
00:59:48,934 --> 00:59:59,803
[SPEAKER_04]: I gotta say, because we were talking about this last week, we were kind of like talking about the whole GameStop leaking the song list, some of the song list unlocks early and stuff, we were like, boy, Konami must be really pissed off at what happened.

842
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:05,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Was there a little bit of frustration from the clue givers and things like that about the GameStop article?

843
01:00:06,522 --> 01:00:07,642
[SPEAKER_26]: Kind of, sort of, yeah, actually.

844
01:00:07,762 --> 01:00:10,763
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, you know, I was talking to Jason... I'm sorry, not GameStop, GamePro, my bad.

845
01:00:10,863 --> 01:00:11,383
[SPEAKER_04]: My bad.

846
01:00:11,803 --> 01:00:23,247
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, Jason Needles was actually kind of, I wouldn't say mad, but he was definitely surprised that they would just blow out a whole bunch of screen caps that more or less gave away a lot of the secrets.

847
01:00:23,496 --> 01:00:32,340
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't think necessarily it was intentional, it was just kind of like somebody just wasn't thinking, they were just grabbing screenshots and not thinking about, oh, maybe somebody's trying to keep the unlocked stuff a secret.

848
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:42,744
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, well, I mean, I actually saw, like, what a press kit, you know, there's essentially different types of versions you get of a game, like, for example, they got what's called a media version, kind of like when a

849
01:00:43,488 --> 01:00:44,288
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know anything about that.

850
01:01:13,211 --> 01:01:21,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I would think stuff like You're Not Here and Maximizer and stuff, you guys were probably trying to keep under the lid a little bit, and then it just kind of got blown out.

851
01:01:21,294 --> 01:01:35,759
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, You're Not Here was a little bit spoiled by the Dancing Stage Fever fusion song list, so it was kind of like, you know, there's a good chance that people were kind of thinking, okay, yeah, that probably would be an unlock, but Maximizer, that was

852
01:01:36,969 --> 01:01:47,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though you can go back to the whole reading the master song list thing and Maximizer had turned up there before, this is really the concrete confirmation people were looking for.

853
01:01:47,433 --> 01:01:48,594
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, it's on there.

854
01:01:48,914 --> 01:01:54,496
[SPEAKER_26]: It's basically, to put it, it's America's own version of Max.

855
01:01:56,317 --> 01:01:57,857
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know whether to be excited or scared.

856
01:01:57,917 --> 01:01:58,297
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm kidding.

857
01:01:58,317 --> 01:02:02,239
[SPEAKER_26]: I actually, I mean, a lot of people look at that and they say, oh, it's an 8-footer.

858
01:02:02,279 --> 01:02:03,840
[SPEAKER_26]: Gosh, you know, that's like a big letdown.

859
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:04,680
[SPEAKER_26]: But I...

860
01:02:05,322 --> 01:02:13,083
[SPEAKER_26]: There was a guy who, you know, Pac-1 Kenobi, who's pretty well known in the DDR community, you know, on DDR Freak, and he was not able to full combo that.

861
01:02:13,643 --> 01:02:20,665
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to say, I am actually glad it's not a 10-footer, because honestly, I can't play 10-footers at home.

862
01:02:20,785 --> 01:02:25,365
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I can barely play them in the arcade as it is, but home versions aren't meant to be 10-footers.

863
01:02:25,565 --> 01:02:26,085
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, exactly.

864
01:02:26,125 --> 01:02:29,946
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you're playing on those freaking ignition pads, you know?

865
01:02:31,246 --> 01:02:32,026
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, that's true.

866
01:02:32,106 --> 01:02:34,747
[SPEAKER_26]: But I will say, Maximizer really sounds cool.

867
01:02:34,867 --> 01:02:35,127
[SPEAKER_26]: I think

868
01:02:35,757 --> 01:02:36,798
[SPEAKER_26]: Gaba, Gaba, Gaba, Gaba, Gaba

869
01:03:05,973 --> 01:03:08,094
[SPEAKER_04]: LankyStyles here with Rice Princess

870
01:03:34,028 --> 01:03:41,336
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I just want to know, Mel B, how do you stay so sexy?

871
01:03:41,476 --> 01:03:46,841
[SPEAKER_26]: I'd say I do about 50 push-ups a day and one pack of pork rinds.

872
01:03:49,264 --> 01:03:49,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

873
01:03:50,748 --> 01:03:59,012
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I'll open up the Skype line in a little bit for those folks that may have a question or something about Ultramix 2 or DDR Extreme.

874
01:03:59,032 --> 01:04:00,753
[SPEAKER_04]: I swear I will hang up on you if it's something else.

875
01:04:01,473 --> 01:04:02,074
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's see.

876
01:04:02,174 --> 01:04:04,775
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go to Skype line and see if anybody has anything they want to say.

877
01:04:04,795 --> 01:04:07,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I just missed that call.

878
01:04:07,336 --> 01:04:07,637
[SPEAKER_04]: My bad.

879
01:04:07,937 --> 01:04:09,017
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see if anybody calls back.

880
01:04:09,718 --> 01:04:10,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Over on the Skype line.

881
01:04:12,359 --> 01:04:14,560
[SPEAKER_04]: You are on Orange Launch Radio.

882
01:04:16,741 --> 01:04:17,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

883
01:04:17,041 --> 01:04:17,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

884
01:04:17,942 --> 01:04:18,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

885
01:04:19,252 --> 01:04:20,414
[SPEAKER_04]: We cannot hear you.

886
01:04:20,474 --> 01:04:22,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you turn up your microphone volume or something?

887
01:04:24,819 --> 01:04:25,380
[SPEAKER_25]: Is this better?

888
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:26,882
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit.

889
01:04:26,922 --> 01:04:27,622
[SPEAKER_25]: Is this better now?

890
01:04:27,883 --> 01:04:28,544
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit.

891
01:04:28,744 --> 01:04:29,325
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing?

892
01:04:30,866 --> 01:04:33,590
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, I missed all the Ultramix 2 thing.

893
01:04:33,610 --> 01:04:34,331
[SPEAKER_25]: Can you fill me in?

894
01:04:36,497 --> 01:04:38,099
[SPEAKER_04]: You missed everything on Ultramix 2?

895
01:04:38,899 --> 01:04:44,104
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, I only managed to pick up the other half, but I got cut.

896
01:04:45,385 --> 01:04:47,788
[SPEAKER_04]: Shame on you for being tardy to the show.

897
01:04:47,968 --> 01:04:48,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Shame on you.

898
01:04:49,549 --> 01:04:51,871
[SPEAKER_25]: I had to clean up my room.

899
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:53,813
[SPEAKER_04]: You could clean your room while listening to the show.

900
01:04:54,093 --> 01:04:54,994
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't buy that excuse.

901
01:04:57,777 --> 01:04:59,018
[SPEAKER_18]: It's going to be on a disc.

902
01:04:59,568 --> 01:05:01,470
[SPEAKER_04]: Ultramix 2, Xbox.

903
01:05:01,730 --> 01:05:03,572
[SPEAKER_04]: The Xbox Live portion is going to be bigger.

904
01:05:03,852 --> 01:05:07,816
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a clue still involving the bagel out there, and it's for a new song.

905
01:05:08,276 --> 01:05:12,039
[SPEAKER_04]: And Ultramix 2 is going to have a variety of different kinds of music.

906
01:05:12,820 --> 01:05:13,401
[SPEAKER_04]: And what else?

907
01:05:13,861 --> 01:05:17,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Folks that are into DDR are doing the steps.

908
01:05:17,224 --> 01:05:17,865
[SPEAKER_04]: We know that much.

909
01:05:18,045 --> 01:05:20,287
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's going to be a mix of challenging versus fun.

910
01:05:21,848 --> 01:05:25,732
[SPEAKER_25]: Who are these people that are actually doing... Are these people well-known?

911
01:05:26,334 --> 01:05:29,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we give any more information about the people doing the steps?

912
01:05:29,195 --> 01:05:30,155
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess not, really.

913
01:05:31,656 --> 01:05:32,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we give names?

914
01:05:32,316 --> 01:05:33,116
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think we can give names.

915
01:05:33,136 --> 01:05:41,799
[SPEAKER_26]: I can't necessarily name, drop, I mean, I'm sure I could, it wouldn't make a hell of a difference, but that said, the people who are in QA are actually... Wait, we can't hear you, Zach, let Mel finish.

916
01:05:42,479 --> 01:05:49,641
[SPEAKER_26]: They are accomplished DDR players, there are people who have won tournaments, there are people who, you know, not only PA'd, there are people who freestyle, so...

917
01:05:50,066 --> 01:05:57,975
[SPEAKER_26]: They take into account, like, you know, for basic steps, for example, you often want steps that are, you know, pretty easy and, like, freestylable, so we take that into account.

918
01:05:58,275 --> 01:06:07,145
[SPEAKER_26]: We take into account that, you know, for maniac steps, there are people who are total difficulty whores, and, you know, we do stuff that is ergonomically, you know, doable.

919
01:06:07,745 --> 01:06:11,930
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, we're not going to do something that's, like, we strive for 11 feet, you know, because...

920
01:06:12,418 --> 01:06:15,079
[SPEAKER_26]: There are such things you need to have as game balancing and such.

921
01:06:15,319 --> 01:06:19,541
[SPEAKER_26]: Like I said, we're trying to find moderation, you know, balance.

922
01:06:19,822 --> 01:06:21,782
[SPEAKER_04]: In other words, Zaku, just go pre-order it tomorrow.

923
01:06:22,303 --> 01:06:22,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Word.

924
01:06:23,003 --> 01:06:23,903
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, one more thing.

925
01:06:24,004 --> 01:06:29,686
[SPEAKER_25]: Have you only focused on one half of the country, or is it all over for these players?

926
01:06:31,367 --> 01:06:33,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Certain players, is it only one part of the country?

927
01:06:33,748 --> 01:06:35,369
[SPEAKER_04]: In other words, are all these players coming from NorCal?

928
01:06:35,785 --> 01:06:38,387
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, let's put it like this.

929
01:06:39,468 --> 01:06:46,733
[SPEAKER_26]: It's based in Redwood City, so it's not like we just sat out there and we had this big audition.

930
01:06:46,993 --> 01:06:51,356
[SPEAKER_26]: Anyone could apply to Konami, but they had to go through the whole interview process.

931
01:06:51,376 --> 01:06:59,482
[SPEAKER_26]: They had to go through people like me who have worked there for a year, and I have to gauge their acumen on how well they play the game, what they think makes the game well.

932
01:07:00,528 --> 01:07:07,033
[SPEAKER_26]: Most of us are based in Northern California, but there are some people who have been imported.

933
01:07:11,917 --> 01:07:14,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Imported from different places, that's all we can tell you, bud.

934
01:07:16,861 --> 01:07:18,162
[SPEAKER_25]: Anything new about that?

935
01:07:18,302 --> 01:07:21,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything that we know about the song list is already up on the site.

936
01:07:21,144 --> 01:07:22,565
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have any new info tonight, though.

937
01:07:23,026 --> 01:07:23,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Not yet.

938
01:07:23,526 --> 01:07:25,087
[SPEAKER_04]: We may have one more song before the night's over.

939
01:07:25,988 --> 01:07:26,608
[SPEAKER_04]: It's up to you guys.

940
01:07:26,669 --> 01:07:28,430
[SPEAKER_25]: Are the song packs going to be better?

941
01:07:29,028 --> 01:07:30,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Are the song packs going to be better?

942
01:07:31,550 --> 01:07:33,171
[SPEAKER_26]: That's an opinion.

943
01:07:33,292 --> 01:07:37,735
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, like I mentioned about SP7, there is new stuff on there.

944
01:07:38,156 --> 01:07:39,116
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll answer it, yes.

945
01:07:40,518 --> 01:07:43,000
[SPEAKER_25]: Wait, the new song pack for Ultramix is coming out already?

946
01:07:44,301 --> 01:07:47,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Service Pack 7 will be out the day that Ultramix 2 is out.

947
01:07:47,904 --> 01:07:51,266
[SPEAKER_25]: Do we have the names of the songs yet?

948
01:07:51,947 --> 01:07:52,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Not yet.

949
01:07:52,808 --> 01:07:53,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Not yet, bud.

950
01:07:53,288 --> 01:07:53,949
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have them soon.

951
01:07:55,090 --> 01:07:56,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, thanks for your questions.

952
01:07:56,791 --> 01:07:57,892
[SPEAKER_04]: It was engaging and fun.

953
01:07:58,958 --> 01:07:59,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye-bye.

954
01:08:00,820 --> 01:08:01,200
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

955
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:03,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see if anybody else wants to call in.

956
01:08:04,042 --> 01:08:06,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Questions about Ultramix 2 or DDR Extreme.

957
01:08:06,544 --> 01:08:11,708
[SPEAKER_04]: In the meantime, let's go over some of these clues.

958
01:08:11,768 --> 01:08:17,412
[SPEAKER_04]: We got some people that guessed some of the songs that were in the game, and now we're going to let you know if anybody was right.

959
01:08:18,713 --> 01:08:19,413
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's see.

960
01:08:19,534 --> 01:08:24,457
[SPEAKER_04]: We had Sigurd put in a guess, but unfortunately he's not allowed to participate because he was right.

961
01:08:24,978 --> 01:08:25,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Woo-hoo!

962
01:08:26,645 --> 01:08:29,449
[SPEAKER_04]: But I will say Sigurd was right on his guess.

963
01:08:29,650 --> 01:08:30,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Good for him.

964
01:08:31,192 --> 01:08:32,434
[SPEAKER_26]: He better be right, man.

965
01:08:33,295 --> 01:08:37,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Jazz said the sweetest thing by some band whose name I have no idea.

966
01:08:37,562 --> 01:08:38,243
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm thinking maybe U2.

967
01:08:39,225 --> 01:08:40,547
[SPEAKER_26]: Now he's thinking too abstract.

968
01:08:40,947 --> 01:08:41,068
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

969
01:08:41,848 --> 01:08:43,029
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a decent guess, though.

970
01:08:43,250 --> 01:08:43,870
[SPEAKER_04]: That was decent.

971
01:08:43,950 --> 01:08:44,571
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, I liked it.

972
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:50,115
[SPEAKER_26]: I think that's the one thing I like about this whole thread thing, is you really get to see how people think.

973
01:08:50,636 --> 01:08:55,420
[SPEAKER_26]: It's like, they'll come up with the strangest word associations, and they'll try to go three steps.

974
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:57,882
[SPEAKER_26]: Because of this and this and this, I think it's this song.

975
01:08:58,222 --> 01:09:01,525
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, it makes for great reading material and sure kills time at work.

976
01:09:01,825 --> 01:09:02,205
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

977
01:09:02,906 --> 01:09:03,887
[SPEAKER_04]: White Rob has a guess.

978
01:09:04,287 --> 01:09:07,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Pam Baker and the Blue Plate Special with Bake in the Blues.

979
01:09:09,045 --> 01:09:10,326
[SPEAKER_26]: Very interesting.

980
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:14,030
[SPEAKER_04]: He says, the plate was blue and the bagel was baked.

981
01:09:15,251 --> 01:09:16,472
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't get more obvious than that.

982
01:09:17,233 --> 01:09:18,374
[SPEAKER_04]: But unfortunately, it's not it.

983
01:09:18,534 --> 01:09:18,794
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

984
01:09:19,495 --> 01:09:19,875
[SPEAKER_26]: No dice.

985
01:09:20,095 --> 01:09:22,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Bummer.

986
01:09:23,919 --> 01:09:24,159
[SPEAKER_04]: E.B.

987
01:09:24,219 --> 01:09:26,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Sumaru says, John Desire with Hot Limit.

988
01:09:27,963 --> 01:09:29,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe because the bagel's hot?

989
01:09:29,224 --> 01:09:29,764
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

990
01:09:30,145 --> 01:09:32,587
[SPEAKER_04]: But... Nah.

991
01:09:32,787 --> 01:09:33,167
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

992
01:09:34,128 --> 01:09:34,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, bud.

993
01:09:34,649 --> 01:09:34,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't work.

994
01:09:36,550 --> 01:09:41,473
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so those are the guesses we got so far, so we'll just have to see if anything else comes in later.

995
01:09:42,274 --> 01:09:49,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Mel was talking about a V-Rare that is coming out for DDR Extreme, and that song list was leaked to the internet this week.

996
01:09:49,479 --> 01:09:52,180
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like some retailers are getting their copies.

997
01:09:52,461 --> 01:09:54,862
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a scan of the back cover and everything.

998
01:09:55,483 --> 01:09:58,204
[SPEAKER_04]: It's out there now, so we got to tell you what's on it.

999
01:09:58,705 --> 01:09:59,285
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, damn.

1000
01:10:00,786 --> 01:10:04,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's another one of those things where they beat you to it, didn't they?

1001
01:10:05,342 --> 01:10:06,823
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, there's only so much you can do.

1002
01:10:07,584 --> 01:10:12,368
[SPEAKER_26]: We held up our end of the bargain, but we can't handle what the retailers do.

1003
01:10:12,629 --> 01:10:13,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the retailers leaked it.

1004
01:10:14,170 --> 01:10:17,013
[SPEAKER_26]: If people like the VRare list, then, you know, hey, all is good in the end.

1005
01:10:18,154 --> 01:10:22,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Track number one is Scorching Moon by Sean the Horny Master, which did not get censored.

1006
01:10:22,798 --> 01:10:26,301
[SPEAKER_04]: People thought it would be censored to just the master or... What's to censor?

1007
01:10:26,401 --> 01:10:27,622
[SPEAKER_26]: The dude plays horns.

1008
01:10:28,743 --> 01:10:29,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

1009
01:10:30,054 --> 01:10:31,315
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, not anymore, you know.

1010
01:10:32,736 --> 01:10:36,498
[SPEAKER_26]: I still have a little sadness in my heart for the fact Shoti's no longer in Konami.

1011
01:10:40,060 --> 01:10:44,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Number 2, A by DJ Amuro is the second track on the CD.

1012
01:10:45,743 --> 01:10:48,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Track number 3 is Ecstasy by D-Complex.

1013
01:10:48,445 --> 01:10:50,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Track number 4 is Your Rain, the Rage Mix.

1014
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:55,429
[SPEAKER_04]: Akira Yamoka featuring Mary Elizabeth McGlynn, the track we premiered for you last month.

1015
01:10:56,273 --> 01:10:58,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Wild Rush, Factor X, is track number five.

1016
01:10:58,755 --> 01:11:02,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Track number six is The Departed, Show T with A Stupid Barber.

1017
01:11:03,137 --> 01:11:05,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Track seven, Mobile Moga by our favorite, Orange Lounge.

1018
01:11:06,219 --> 01:11:10,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Track number eight, Jet World by Muchiko Izumi.

1019
01:11:10,642 --> 01:11:10,962
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm white.

1020
01:11:11,322 --> 01:11:14,124
[SPEAKER_04]: And track nine, 321 Stars by DJ Simon.

1021
01:11:14,464 --> 01:11:17,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Track ten, V for Extreme by DJ Taka.

1022
01:11:18,658 --> 01:11:19,859
[SPEAKER_04]: And here are the bonus tracks.

1023
01:11:20,439 --> 01:11:23,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Eleven is I Need You, the Inside Door 3 mixes.

1024
01:11:24,041 --> 01:11:25,181
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never heard of that one before.

1025
01:11:25,481 --> 01:11:29,984
[SPEAKER_26]: Um, actually, that was, uh, yeah, Party Collection VRare also.

1026
01:11:30,324 --> 01:11:32,285
[SPEAKER_26]: No, actually, they're one of the VRares that came out in Japan.

1027
01:11:32,305 --> 01:11:36,447
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, it's like, it has all three mixes, like, all kind of used together.

1028
01:11:36,467 --> 01:11:37,107
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of neat.

1029
01:11:37,127 --> 01:11:38,448
[SPEAKER_26]: No, it's just the Inside Door 3.

1030
01:11:42,250 --> 01:11:42,590
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1031
01:11:43,231 --> 01:11:43,591
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, okay.

1032
01:11:43,811 --> 01:11:44,131
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1033
01:11:44,291 --> 01:11:45,972
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Supafova does that one.

1034
01:11:46,052 --> 01:11:50,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Drop the Bomb, the original extended mix by Scotty D. Should be an interesting track.

1035
01:11:52,715 --> 01:11:52,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it?

1036
01:11:53,175 --> 01:11:53,996
[SPEAKER_04]: On the Party Collection OST?

1037
01:11:54,076 --> 01:11:56,857
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know that.

1038
01:11:56,997 --> 01:11:58,698
[SPEAKER_04]: 13 is Be For You, Glorious Style.

1039
01:11:58,718 --> 01:12:00,879
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be the long version from DDR5th Mix.

1040
01:12:01,159 --> 01:12:02,440
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys trying to hint at something there?

1041
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:03,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe?

1042
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:03,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

1043
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:04,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe not.

1044
01:12:05,641 --> 01:12:11,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Track 14 is So In Love, the train version by Caramel S and The Master.

1045
01:12:13,294 --> 01:12:17,798
[SPEAKER_04]: and track number 15 is I Need You, the true platinum mix by Show-T.

1046
01:12:19,119 --> 01:12:20,160
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the V-Rare.

1047
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:20,480
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

1048
01:12:20,780 --> 01:12:34,731
[SPEAKER_26]: Actually, while it's still on my mind, one thing I'd like to point out also for anyone who's fans of Konami artists and, like, the B-Mani musicians, one of the games that's coming out this fall, Rumble Roses for PS2, the all-female wrestling game.

1049
01:12:35,412 --> 01:12:37,373
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, two of the best things ever made.

1050
01:12:37,393 --> 01:12:37,994
[SPEAKER_26]: Hot!

1051
01:12:38,948 --> 01:12:44,532
[SPEAKER_26]: A lot of the B-Money musicians did compose music for that, like DJ Taka did a track there.

1052
01:12:46,894 --> 01:12:49,095
[SPEAKER_26]: Sota Fujimori did stuff there.

1053
01:12:50,116 --> 01:12:51,217
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, let's see, who else?

1054
01:12:51,497 --> 01:12:56,621
[SPEAKER_26]: The guy who did, freak, I can't remember his name, but the guy who did Jet World, he did something.

1055
01:12:57,281 --> 01:12:58,822
[SPEAKER_26]: Dez Rowe did a track on there.

1056
01:12:59,303 --> 01:13:07,949
[SPEAKER_26]: So yeah, I mean, it's actually funny enough, they were called at their commission somewhere at the last minute to do music for the game, and from what I've heard, it sounds pretty cool.

1057
01:13:09,230 --> 01:13:09,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

1058
01:13:10,070 --> 01:13:10,730
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't wait to see it.

1059
01:13:10,770 --> 01:13:14,031
[SPEAKER_04]: So definitely, if you're a Bomani music fan, you're going to have to pick up Rumble Roses.

1060
01:13:14,412 --> 01:13:17,572
[SPEAKER_04]: But of course, as soon as we can get our hands on a soundtrack, we'll play some tracks for you.

1061
01:13:17,592 --> 01:13:18,173
[SPEAKER_26]: How could I forget?

1062
01:13:18,253 --> 01:13:20,993
[SPEAKER_26]: Akira Yamaoka did tracks on there as well.

1063
01:13:22,154 --> 01:13:22,574
[SPEAKER_26]: Gosh.

1064
01:13:22,814 --> 01:13:23,574
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Sigurd.

1065
01:13:24,875 --> 01:13:25,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

1066
01:13:26,715 --> 01:13:27,155
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1067
01:13:28,316 --> 01:13:32,437
[SPEAKER_18]: The other night, a bunch of us were at Lions, and it was like Dan's GameStop people.

1068
01:13:33,137 --> 01:13:36,318
[SPEAKER_18]: And they were there discussing on how they were looking forward to the...

1069
01:13:37,031 --> 01:13:43,776
[SPEAKER_18]: Realistic Physics Engine of Rumble Roses and the Invigorating Mud Effects.

1070
01:13:44,857 --> 01:13:46,358
[SPEAKER_18]: It was a funny conversation.

1071
01:13:46,918 --> 01:13:52,122
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, talking about how they were going to admire the aesthetic qualities of Rumble Roses.

1072
01:13:52,222 --> 01:13:56,405
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, we did talk about this a couple weeks ago, chat room, but I didn't know about the Desro thing.

1073
01:13:56,425 --> 01:13:58,807
[SPEAKER_04]: There's more artists in there than we originally thought.

1074
01:13:58,907 --> 01:14:01,789
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew Akira and I knew some of them, but I didn't know Desro.

1075
01:14:01,809 --> 01:14:03,170
[SPEAKER_04]: There's way more people than I thought.

1076
01:14:03,710 --> 01:14:04,351
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty cool.

1077
01:14:05,262 --> 01:14:09,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Any chance we might see some Rumble Roses songs on DDR, complete with some new characters?

1078
01:14:11,284 --> 01:14:12,624
[SPEAKER_04]: As I do my little bounce thing.

1079
01:14:13,325 --> 01:14:15,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1080
01:14:15,625 --> 01:14:17,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Question from Explicit, here in the house.

1081
01:14:18,126 --> 01:14:20,467
[SPEAKER_04]: How many polygons are in each breast in Rumble Roses?

1082
01:14:22,287 --> 01:14:26,329
[SPEAKER_04]: More than a handful.

1083
01:14:26,589 --> 01:14:30,050
[SPEAKER_04]: On that note, I think we'll go to a break.

1084
01:14:30,598 --> 01:14:37,481
[SPEAKER_04]: and to make up for Floatwalk's grotesque error earlier, we will be playing an entire block of Akira Yamaoka music.

1085
01:14:38,942 --> 01:14:40,183
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, including some requests.

1086
01:14:40,203 --> 01:14:40,843
[SPEAKER_04]: We had some requests.

1087
01:14:40,883 --> 01:14:42,224
[SPEAKER_04]: So we will go to this.

1088
01:14:43,204 --> 01:14:43,464
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

1089
01:14:43,484 --> 01:14:44,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to do that other clue?

1090
01:14:45,565 --> 01:14:46,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Should we do the other clue, Floatwalk?

1091
01:14:48,327 --> 01:14:48,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not?

1092
01:14:48,807 --> 01:14:51,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell, Floatwalk, let's give him another chance.

1093
01:14:53,319 --> 01:14:55,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Clue, colon, a unique aspect of a type of cells in the body.

1094
01:14:55,761 --> 01:14:57,923
[SPEAKER_26]: So, uh, those of you who took physiology in high school...

1095
01:15:21,008 --> 01:15:25,952
[SPEAKER_26]: Time to dust off your books and your brains and you just might find something.

1096
01:15:26,272 --> 01:15:27,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Have fun, boys and girls.

1097
01:15:27,353 --> 01:15:27,873
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be back.

1098
01:15:30,815 --> 01:15:33,497
You touched my body once.

1099
01:15:33,597 --> 01:15:34,778
It burned.

1100
01:16:42,568 --> 01:16:43,651
Thanks for watching!

1101
01:17:12,512 --> 01:17:15,574
[SPEAKER_01]: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

1102
01:17:43,522 --> 01:17:44,924
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1103
01:18:05,871 --> 01:18:09,314
[SPEAKER_01]: Amagi Novoleo Amagi Novoleo Amagi Novoleo

1104
01:21:00,891 --> 01:21:02,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio.

1105
01:21:02,472 --> 01:21:04,634
[SPEAKER_04]: We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.

1106
01:21:09,898 --> 01:21:10,478
[SPEAKER_04]: We are back.

1107
01:21:10,558 --> 01:21:18,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio Season 5 has just started, and in case you missed it, a unique aspect of a type of cells in the body.

1108
01:21:19,064 --> 01:21:20,905
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time to guess one more time.

1109
01:21:20,985 --> 01:21:25,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Send it in over private message to Sky in the chat room if you have a guess.

1110
01:21:26,653 --> 01:21:30,575
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, you can't participate tonight because you drove.

1111
01:21:30,615 --> 01:21:32,856
[SPEAKER_04]: So... You got a mic right next to you, hon.

1112
01:21:32,876 --> 01:21:33,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Other side.

1113
01:21:33,316 --> 01:21:33,957
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1114
01:21:33,997 --> 01:21:35,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, normally I would have, like, one thing.

1115
01:21:35,998 --> 01:21:36,598
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1116
01:21:36,978 --> 01:21:38,579
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to be good today, but sort of not.

1117
01:21:38,599 --> 01:21:40,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if I were going to be bad...

1118
01:21:56,061 --> 01:21:58,482
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd be breaking into the pizza and then having a few shots.

1119
01:22:00,062 --> 01:22:04,383
[SPEAKER_18]: But because I ate the whole thing of ice cream today.

1120
01:22:05,324 --> 01:22:07,444
[SPEAKER_18]: I wanted ice cream so bad all week.

1121
01:22:07,804 --> 01:22:09,725
[SPEAKER_18]: I wanted ice cream more than I wanted booze.

1122
01:22:09,765 --> 01:22:13,446
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I'm going to do... Imagine if they made ice cream booze.

1123
01:22:14,206 --> 01:22:15,067
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh my God.

1124
01:22:15,767 --> 01:22:21,428
[SPEAKER_18]: I've actually sort of... I had this creme brulee liqueur that was really good.

1125
01:22:21,928 --> 01:22:23,609
[SPEAKER_18]: So I've decided how to cheat.

1126
01:22:25,106 --> 01:22:27,248
[SPEAKER_18]: I decided that tomorrow was going to be my cheat day.

1127
01:22:27,308 --> 01:22:29,389
[SPEAKER_18]: So when it hits midnight, I'm having some Guinness at home.

1128
01:22:29,590 --> 01:22:30,170
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1129
01:22:30,350 --> 01:22:30,951
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the spirit.

1130
01:22:30,991 --> 01:22:33,472
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to finish off the Guinness in my fridge and have some Amaretto.

1131
01:22:33,673 --> 01:22:34,073
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1132
01:22:34,253 --> 01:22:35,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Any special plans for Labor Day?

1133
01:22:37,756 --> 01:22:38,296
[SPEAKER_18]: Sleeping.

1134
01:22:40,878 --> 01:22:41,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds good to me.

1135
01:22:41,479 --> 01:22:44,041
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, no, I'm going to do my homework tomorrow.

1136
01:22:44,061 --> 01:22:46,202
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going over to Julie's where there's air conditioning.

1137
01:22:46,663 --> 01:22:47,603
[SPEAKER_18]: Air conditioning, wow.

1138
01:22:48,244 --> 01:22:49,985
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm going to do my laundry.

1139
01:22:50,005 --> 01:22:53,148
[SPEAKER_18]: Because see, look what I did not bring over tonight.

1140
01:22:53,328 --> 01:22:53,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Laundry.

1141
01:22:53,668 --> 01:22:54,429
[SPEAKER_18]: Was my laundry.

1142
01:22:54,489 --> 01:22:54,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Impressive.

1143
01:22:55,609 --> 01:22:59,912
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm doing my laundry at Julie's tomorrow and making use of one of her five computers that she built.

1144
01:23:01,373 --> 01:23:01,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds good.

1145
01:23:03,434 --> 01:23:03,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Loki.

1146
01:23:04,915 --> 01:23:05,055
[SPEAKER_18]: No.

1147
01:23:06,116 --> 01:23:06,336
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1148
01:23:08,357 --> 01:23:11,019
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm actually working on right now building my own laptop.

1149
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:14,021
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, actually, it's not really a laptop.

1150
01:23:14,481 --> 01:23:24,168
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to be putting it inside of a case of a Dreamcast, and it's going to be a portable PC with its own LCD monitor, which will also double as a car PC with its own navigational and GPS system.

1151
01:23:24,921 --> 01:23:27,242
[SPEAKER_06]: and will be an on-road computer for our show.

1152
01:23:27,762 --> 01:23:30,243
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, you know the Dreamcast uses Windows CE.

1153
01:23:30,744 --> 01:23:32,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm actually gutting it.

1154
01:23:32,264 --> 01:23:33,185
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just using the case.

1155
01:23:33,565 --> 01:23:35,126
[SPEAKER_18]: Like the Nintendo PC?

1156
01:23:35,606 --> 01:23:37,987
[SPEAKER_06]: Something like that.

1157
01:23:38,087 --> 01:23:45,851
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to use a Nano ITX motherboard, but they're not available yet, so I'm going to have to use a Micro ITX board.

1158
01:23:45,891 --> 01:23:47,791
[SPEAKER_18]: Why not build one out of a PS2?

1159
01:23:49,853 --> 01:23:52,375
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, because... Because you can find plenty of broken PS2s.

1160
01:23:52,515 --> 01:23:54,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Dreamcast is small.

1161
01:23:54,796 --> 01:23:59,019
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to use an old PS1 because they sell for $30 on the internet.

1162
01:23:59,039 --> 01:23:59,820
[SPEAKER_18]: I could give you one.

1163
01:24:00,140 --> 01:24:03,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, a PS1, but the board's too big for it.

1164
01:24:03,202 --> 01:24:05,804
[SPEAKER_06]: If I had a Nano ITX one, it would fit perfect.

1165
01:24:06,505 --> 01:24:08,386
[SPEAKER_06]: But as it is, I don't know.

1166
01:24:08,486 --> 01:24:10,727
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just pricing it because it's kind of expensive.

1167
01:24:10,747 --> 01:24:12,889
[SPEAKER_18]: The Nintendo one was built out of laptop parts.

1168
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:14,682
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's what I'm going to do.

1169
01:24:14,722 --> 01:24:17,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Laptop, hard drive, LCD monitor.

1170
01:24:17,325 --> 01:24:22,311
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm actually going to hack a portable PlayStation 1 LCD screen.

1171
01:24:22,411 --> 01:24:24,313
[SPEAKER_18]: They have a Dreamcast mobile monitor, though.

1172
01:24:25,214 --> 01:24:26,516
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll have to check that, too.

1173
01:24:26,936 --> 01:24:30,640
[SPEAKER_18]: I think one of the ones on Lixang.

1174
01:24:30,660 --> 01:24:31,882
[SPEAKER_06]: Lixang, I'll have to check them.

1175
01:24:32,202 --> 01:24:33,522
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyways, yeah, that's what I'm going to work on.

1176
01:24:33,542 --> 01:24:39,985
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be kind of cool because I want to, like, I was actually, what I was setting up for was mini-MAME or, like, mini-Bomani stuff.

1177
01:24:40,125 --> 01:24:45,586
[SPEAKER_06]: So, like, making a micro turntable Beatmania type setup for, like, that kind of thing.

1178
01:24:45,646 --> 01:24:48,487
[SPEAKER_06]: But the only problem is they're not very powerful PCs.

1179
01:24:48,527 --> 01:24:51,268
[SPEAKER_06]: They only go up to, like, 1 gigahertz.

1180
01:24:51,708 --> 01:24:55,610
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they're just, you know, they're mic, no fan or anything, but it's awesome.

1181
01:24:56,470 --> 01:24:59,791
[SPEAKER_18]: They make the, like, they have, like, tiny fans now and heat sinks.

1182
01:25:00,222 --> 01:25:00,442
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1183
01:25:00,662 --> 01:25:01,963
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, that's the project I'm working on.

1184
01:25:02,003 --> 01:25:02,623
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds cool.

1185
01:25:03,323 --> 01:25:05,304
[SPEAKER_18]: So you've given up on communicating with the dead?

1186
01:25:05,324 --> 01:25:07,805
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope, have not.

1187
01:25:07,825 --> 01:25:11,786
[SPEAKER_06]: I have my eight and a half pounds of magnet wire in my room.

1188
01:25:12,467 --> 01:25:14,987
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have my germanium on my desk.

1189
01:25:16,348 --> 01:25:24,331
[SPEAKER_06]: And I actually was looking at copper today, but they only have copper-plated circuit boards.

1190
01:25:24,511 --> 01:25:26,612
[SPEAKER_06]: But that might be good enough just to stick on there.

1191
01:25:26,672 --> 01:25:26,972
[SPEAKER_06]: You can...

1192
01:25:27,899 --> 01:25:31,021
[SPEAKER_18]: Order copper from the science ordering places.

1193
01:25:31,181 --> 01:25:33,063
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I just need a copper plate, and it's small.

1194
01:25:33,383 --> 01:25:33,923
[SPEAKER_18]: Copper plate?

1195
01:25:35,492 --> 01:25:36,192
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll talk to you about that later.

1196
01:25:36,212 --> 01:25:36,873
[SPEAKER_18]: I think I know where to do it.

1197
01:25:37,173 --> 01:25:39,534
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, I'm just looking in the parts for that.

1198
01:25:39,794 --> 01:25:49,940
[SPEAKER_06]: The only thing is I figured out that the guy's design is physically impossible because if you were to make something that strong in that small of space, it would literally melt.

1199
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:51,941
[SPEAKER_06]: It would just be gone.

1200
01:25:52,081 --> 01:25:52,621
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know.

1201
01:25:52,641 --> 01:25:54,822
[SPEAKER_18]: This dead would take it over and it'd open a portal to hell.

1202
01:25:54,862 --> 01:25:55,663
[SPEAKER_18]: No, it wouldn't do that.

1203
01:25:56,003 --> 01:25:59,184
[SPEAKER_06]: The only portal it'd open would be burning down the house.

1204
01:25:59,364 --> 01:26:02,146
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just don't... It couldn't...

1205
01:26:03,004 --> 01:26:11,568
[SPEAKER_18]: It couldn't maintain the structural integrity it needs to keep the portal to hell open, so it would just burn up from the flames of Hades.

1206
01:26:12,409 --> 01:26:14,210
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyways, yeah, I'll do that later.

1207
01:26:14,290 --> 01:26:19,192
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be hotter than a... I was pricing it today at Radio Shack, but I don't like Radio Shack because they're too expensive.

1208
01:26:28,337 --> 01:26:29,117
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, anyways.

1209
01:26:29,658 --> 01:26:30,598
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to go back to drinking.

1210
01:26:34,614 --> 01:26:35,695
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, you learned quickly.

1211
01:26:41,679 --> 01:26:43,240
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, I'm in a sound effects mood today.

1212
01:26:44,141 --> 01:26:47,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, let's go see if we got any guesses.

1213
01:26:47,663 --> 01:26:49,464
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually only got one more guess.

1214
01:26:49,785 --> 01:26:53,327
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like some people, they want more time with this clue.

1215
01:26:53,387 --> 01:26:58,030
[SPEAKER_04]: They want more time with the unique aspect of a type of cells in the body clue.

1216
01:26:58,411 --> 01:27:00,772
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm wondering how it feels to want.

1217
01:27:01,213 --> 01:27:01,473
Okay.

1218
01:27:01,873 --> 01:27:07,118
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we will give another chance for guesses if there's still... Some people want to Google it, so they're Googling away.

1219
01:27:07,439 --> 01:27:08,079
[SPEAKER_04]: But we do have one guess.

1220
01:27:08,099 --> 01:27:09,741
[SPEAKER_18]: You should have paid attention in school.

1221
01:27:09,861 --> 01:27:10,381
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all right.

1222
01:27:10,902 --> 01:27:13,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Chaos Dimension suggests a song, and I've never heard of this.

1223
01:27:14,205 --> 01:27:18,009
[SPEAKER_04]: You Got Beef by Chucky Akins and V-Unit.

1224
01:27:19,150 --> 01:27:19,450
[SPEAKER_19]: Rob.

1225
01:27:20,431 --> 01:27:22,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Mel's saying no, no, no.

1226
01:27:23,894 --> 01:27:24,134
[SPEAKER_19]: Rob.

1227
01:27:24,935 --> 01:27:25,155
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1228
01:27:25,536 --> 01:27:26,697
[SPEAKER_19]: Isn't it nice to want...

1229
01:27:27,869 --> 01:27:29,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't it nice to say something Jamie just said?

1230
01:27:29,730 --> 01:27:31,951
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I just sort of said that.

1231
01:27:33,871 --> 01:27:34,192
[SPEAKER_19]: Rent!

1232
01:27:34,832 --> 01:27:35,212
[SPEAKER_18]: Pay it!

1233
01:27:37,893 --> 01:27:38,273
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

1234
01:27:39,694 --> 01:27:43,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Seegard got it right on the second guess as well as the first guess, amazingly enough.

1235
01:27:43,355 --> 01:27:45,796
[SPEAKER_04]: He sent me another message and he got it right.

1236
01:27:45,916 --> 01:27:46,676
[SPEAKER_04]: I was so amazed.

1237
01:27:47,877 --> 01:27:53,099
[SPEAKER_26]: If you got it right on the second guess, that's kind of like saying he battled himself in a race and he came in third place.

1238
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:56,220
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.

1239
01:27:58,220 --> 01:27:58,700
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful people.

1240
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:00,021
[SPEAKER_18]: That means his ass came in last.

1241
01:28:02,963 --> 01:28:09,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, as somebody says in the chat room, as I recall, you got beef is not a unique aspect of a type of self in the body.

1242
01:28:10,128 --> 01:28:12,769
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe, well, you know, if you... We got the beef self.

1243
01:28:13,029 --> 01:28:15,771
[SPEAKER_04]: If you call yourself maybe a beefy built guy, I don't know.

1244
01:28:15,931 --> 01:28:17,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, moving on.

1245
01:28:18,313 --> 01:28:18,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Where'd Loki go?

1246
01:28:19,053 --> 01:28:19,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Did he disappear into the bathroom?

1247
01:28:19,974 --> 01:28:20,574
[SPEAKER_15]: Seriously.

1248
01:28:20,594 --> 01:28:21,175
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to talk to him.

1249
01:28:22,515 --> 01:28:24,897
[SPEAKER_15]: Just, like, pay attention in school.

1250
01:28:26,650 --> 01:28:28,532
[SPEAKER_15]: See, people don't like to be made to think.

1251
01:28:29,513 --> 01:28:30,154
[SPEAKER_18]: That's alright.

1252
01:28:30,955 --> 01:28:31,455
[SPEAKER_04]: It is hard.

1253
01:28:31,515 --> 01:28:32,236
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a hard clue.

1254
01:28:32,396 --> 01:28:33,097
[SPEAKER_04]: There are hard clues.

1255
01:28:33,117 --> 01:28:34,579
[SPEAKER_04]: This is why it's taking you so long to get it.

1256
01:28:34,839 --> 01:28:36,521
[SPEAKER_18]: Nobody likes to be made to think.

1257
01:28:37,522 --> 01:28:38,844
[SPEAKER_18]: Because nobody thinks anymore.

1258
01:28:39,745 --> 01:28:40,946
[SPEAKER_18]: Chatroom, prove me wrong.

1259
01:28:43,549 --> 01:28:44,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.

1260
01:28:44,410 --> 01:28:44,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

1261
01:28:45,111 --> 01:28:45,832
[SPEAKER_15]: See what I mean?

1262
01:28:46,412 --> 01:28:46,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on.

1263
01:28:48,824 --> 01:28:52,125
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys know about the big day of November 18th coming up.

1264
01:28:52,145 --> 01:28:59,926
[SPEAKER_04]: 18 November, as some folks have been referring to it, where we get a whole shitload of new releases from Japan, including Poppin' Music 10.

1265
01:29:00,206 --> 01:29:02,527
[SPEAKER_04]: And there is a brand new website open for Poppin' Music 10.

1266
01:29:03,107 --> 01:29:09,768
[SPEAKER_04]: And it doesn't give us a whole lot about the game, but it does show us those cute little Kubricks that are coming with the limited edition.

1267
01:29:10,388 --> 01:29:10,788
[SPEAKER_04]: So cute!

1268
01:29:10,808 --> 01:29:11,849
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, I need to get that.

1269
01:29:12,269 --> 01:29:13,989
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I need Poppin' Music Kubricks.

1270
01:29:14,264 --> 01:29:17,245
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some more information in our chat room, if you care.

1271
01:29:18,166 --> 01:29:20,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Link to the website that has more information.

1272
01:29:21,067 --> 01:29:30,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, 8th Style is going to be getting a limited edition with it, and apparently the limited edition comes with some kind of, what I thought was cool, not only do you get a little EMUs card, but you also get...

1273
01:29:32,089 --> 01:29:33,090
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to add a comment on 8thStyle.

1274
01:29:33,110 --> 01:29:33,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1275
01:29:33,210 --> 01:29:35,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I got a report from DarkLionXVI this afternoon, a.k.a.

1276
01:29:35,311 --> 01:29:38,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Siggy, that he was saying that the limited edition was going to be retailed at $130.

1277
01:29:38,172 --> 01:29:38,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1278
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:01,680
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

1279
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:05,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I wish Siggy was on Skype right now because I'd call him and make him tell us more information about the game.

1280
01:30:07,242 --> 01:30:07,763
[SPEAKER_04]: He's on Skype.

1281
01:30:07,783 --> 01:30:08,983
[SPEAKER_19]: I was going to say something, but no.

1282
01:30:09,003 --> 01:30:10,404
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you mean, who cares?

1283
01:30:10,584 --> 01:30:11,344
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to eat style.

1284
01:30:14,045 --> 01:30:14,725
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's true.

1285
01:30:14,745 --> 01:30:16,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Mel's saying, who cares what's in it?

1286
01:30:16,706 --> 01:30:16,806
[SPEAKER_04]: It's $130.

1287
01:30:17,847 --> 01:30:18,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Buy it.

1288
01:30:19,848 --> 01:30:20,568
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the problem?

1289
01:30:20,628 --> 01:30:21,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Just buy it.

1290
01:30:23,349 --> 01:30:24,129
[SPEAKER_19]: And how?

1291
01:30:27,871 --> 01:30:28,171
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1292
01:30:29,687 --> 01:30:30,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Ziggy's not on Skype right now.

1293
01:30:31,008 --> 01:30:32,009
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll try to call him later.

1294
01:30:32,049 --> 01:30:36,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe he can give us more information about what's going on with the... Because I haven't been paying close enough attention.

1295
01:30:37,252 --> 01:30:39,273
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm getting confused enough at all the U.S.

1296
01:30:39,473 --> 01:30:44,557
[SPEAKER_04]: news going around that I can't keep track of the Japanese news as well, so... Anyway.

1297
01:30:46,458 --> 01:30:48,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Shall we have ourselves a cage match, boys and girls?

1298
01:30:48,799 --> 01:30:49,620
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's do it!

1299
01:30:49,880 --> 01:30:50,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay!

1300
01:30:50,701 --> 01:30:52,121
[SPEAKER_04]: We's gonna have a cage match!

1301
01:30:55,604 --> 01:30:57,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Last week in the Orange Lounge cage match...

1302
01:30:58,334 --> 01:30:59,834
[SPEAKER_04]: I need a quiet in the studio, please.

1303
01:30:59,854 --> 01:31:01,695
[SPEAKER_04]: There's too much sidebar conversation going on.

1304
01:31:01,735 --> 01:31:02,595
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't hear ourselves.

1305
01:31:03,976 --> 01:31:04,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1306
01:31:06,956 --> 01:31:14,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Last week in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, we had Bond 1, that was Jamie's pick, with a song called Shine.

1307
01:31:14,899 --> 01:31:16,919
[SPEAKER_04]: And what was so special about Shine, Jamie?

1308
01:31:17,019 --> 01:31:19,200
[SPEAKER_18]: It used some of the same samples from Afronova.

1309
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:19,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1310
01:31:20,322 --> 01:31:22,844
[SPEAKER_04]: So it has a little bit of a DDR tie into it, so we'll hear that.

1311
01:31:23,205 --> 01:31:25,126
[SPEAKER_04]: But you only get to hear a clip of last week's winner.

1312
01:31:25,447 --> 01:31:31,652
[SPEAKER_04]: As a reminder, the way the cage match works, we're going to play three songs for you guys, a clip of last week's winner, and two new songs.

1313
01:31:32,253 --> 01:31:39,579
[SPEAKER_04]: And the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio, as chosen by your votes in the chat room.

1314
01:31:39,980 --> 01:31:41,661
[SPEAKER_04]: So we will get to it.

1315
01:31:41,701 --> 01:31:43,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's song number one you can vote for tonight.

1316
01:31:43,523 --> 01:31:45,585
[SPEAKER_04]: But please remember, do not vote until I say so.

1317
01:31:46,656 --> 01:31:49,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Song number one, Bond with Shine, the Dub Chakra mix.

1318
01:31:49,822 --> 01:31:50,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a clip, enjoy.

1319
01:34:06,348 --> 01:34:07,969
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, that was last week's winner.

1320
01:34:08,369 --> 01:34:11,572
[SPEAKER_04]: That was Bond with Shine, the dub Chakra Mix.

1321
01:34:11,692 --> 01:34:12,933
[SPEAKER_18]: That song just makes me happy.

1322
01:34:13,033 --> 01:34:17,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Will it win for two weeks in a row, or will it succumb to one of our challengers tonight?

1323
01:34:17,276 --> 01:34:18,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's find out.

1324
01:34:18,757 --> 01:34:22,279
[SPEAKER_04]: First challenger tonight is one of my picks, and you know what?

1325
01:34:22,339 --> 01:34:28,844
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to admit, ever since I heard that Skulk was announced for Ultramix, I've been liking that band Echo Image more and more.

1326
01:34:29,484 --> 01:34:56,043
[SPEAKER_04]: and not that Sigurd has anything to do with that by allowing me to borrow the CD for a little while but honestly, the more I listen to it, the more they remind me of Erasure and all these cool synth-bop bands I love and I gotta say, I love this song and I want to put it in tonight's cage match it's a song by Echo Image from their CD and the song is called Standing Alone it's track 2 from their album, I believe it's called Compufonic I'm going off the top of my head there so here it is

1327
01:34:56,980 --> 01:34:58,661
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you like Skulk, you might like this.

1328
01:34:58,962 --> 01:34:59,282
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1329
01:34:59,302 --> 01:34:59,662
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

1330
01:34:59,702 --> 01:35:01,584
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Echo Image with Standing Alone.

1331
01:35:01,644 --> 01:35:01,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Enjoy.

1332
01:36:51,212 --> 01:37:06,982
Black rain clouds sealing up the sun The shouting voices in your head Tell me nothing You scream but no one hear you calling You left without your life

1333
01:39:46,421 --> 01:39:52,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, as typical Orange Lounge fashion dictates, we'll go around and see what everyone thought of Echo Image with Standing Alone.

1334
01:39:53,224 --> 01:39:56,406
[SPEAKER_04]: And not standing alone there in the corners, DarkSakura with her impression.

1335
01:39:56,766 --> 01:39:59,227
[SPEAKER_18]: It freaking sounds like Depeche Mode, I like it.

1336
01:39:59,887 --> 01:40:02,729
[SPEAKER_18]: So, that one gets a 9 for me.

1337
01:40:03,689 --> 01:40:04,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice solid 9.

1338
01:40:04,229 --> 01:40:05,310
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's not trance.

1339
01:40:06,511 --> 01:40:07,112
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Floatwalk

1340
01:40:34,760 --> 01:40:35,840
[SPEAKER_26]: It's pretty solid.

1341
01:40:35,981 --> 01:40:37,241
[SPEAKER_26]: It's a smooth track.

1342
01:40:37,261 --> 01:40:37,781
[SPEAKER_26]: That's what I like.

1343
01:40:37,801 --> 01:40:44,704
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, you got all the keys to Cincinnati, but it's not overly, you know, like, it's just not very loud and over-imposing.

1344
01:40:45,204 --> 01:40:48,785
[SPEAKER_26]: I just think it's something you can really relax to, and that's why I dig it a lot.

1345
01:40:48,845 --> 01:40:50,206
[SPEAKER_26]: I think I'll give it a nine and a half.

1346
01:40:50,726 --> 01:40:51,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, lanky style.

1347
01:40:53,327 --> 01:40:53,967
[SPEAKER_05]: I like it, man.

1348
01:40:54,027 --> 01:41:00,309
[SPEAKER_05]: So far, the two tracks I've heard from them have been really good, so I gotta listen to that CD sometimes, so I'm gonna give it a nine.

1349
01:41:00,329 --> 01:41:01,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Good stuff.

1350
01:41:02,310 --> 01:41:02,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Shark Scroll.

1351
01:41:03,800 --> 01:41:07,081
[SPEAKER_16]: PrettyNine Angel

1352
01:41:33,389 --> 01:41:34,989
[SPEAKER_19]: That sounds hot, as well as the rest of the TV.

1353
01:41:35,009 --> 01:41:35,789
[SPEAKER_19]: So you know what?

1354
01:41:36,470 --> 01:41:36,730
[SPEAKER_19]: Fat 10.

1355
01:41:37,870 --> 01:41:39,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, another Fat 10.

1356
01:41:39,770 --> 01:41:40,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Explicit.

1357
01:41:40,330 --> 01:41:43,991
[SPEAKER_27]: This song gave me an orgasm.

1358
01:41:45,891 --> 01:41:48,452
[SPEAKER_27]: I like this song a lot, though, so I'll give it a 9.5 out of 10.

1359
01:41:49,512 --> 01:41:49,892
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1360
01:41:50,872 --> 01:41:51,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on.

1361
01:41:53,113 --> 01:41:54,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, how you doing, Heather?

1362
01:41:56,053 --> 01:41:57,453
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, who the hell did the mic go to?

1363
01:41:58,353 --> 01:42:01,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki's sister's here to give her impression of the song.

1364
01:42:03,704 --> 01:42:04,985
[SPEAKER_07]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1365
01:42:33,926 --> 01:42:36,867
[SPEAKER_04]: I want more of these embarrassing Loki stories after Cage Match.

1366
01:42:38,328 --> 01:42:43,230
[SPEAKER_06]: Fire Poker, it was one of those log, like, you know how they have those things to pick up logs?

1367
01:42:43,250 --> 01:42:46,551
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a log grabber thing, you could move logs in a firebox.

1368
01:42:46,571 --> 01:42:49,952
[SPEAKER_04]: We are so sending Loki out of the room after Cage Match, I want more of these stories.

1369
01:42:50,213 --> 01:42:52,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anybody else?

1370
01:42:53,354 --> 01:42:55,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Does Loki's girlfriend want to give a number to that song?

1371
01:42:56,935 --> 01:42:58,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, what song?

1372
01:42:59,753 --> 01:43:11,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, next up is Loki's pick, and Loki has picked something very special for you guys tonight, very special, it's special.

1373
01:43:12,242 --> 01:43:29,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, now, I was gonna go with my remix, which, you know, that's just, you know, standard, because, you know, I make it, and so it's gotta be in there, but no, no, um, you know, my fiance had better plans, so she picked this song, I don't know who it's by, um, it's, uh,

1374
01:43:30,184 --> 01:43:32,566
[SPEAKER_06]: Papa Smurf, Lick My Ass

1375
01:47:18,342 --> 01:47:19,343
[SPEAKER_10]: The Chocolate Factory

1376
01:47:48,098 --> 01:47:50,519
[SPEAKER_04]: A score of negative infinity from Jamie.

1377
01:47:50,559 --> 01:47:51,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's hear from Loki.

1378
01:47:53,281 --> 01:47:55,542
[SPEAKER_06]: I tell you, this is my fiance's pick.

1379
01:47:55,602 --> 01:47:56,523
[SPEAKER_06]: I did it for her.

1380
01:47:56,743 --> 01:47:57,504
[SPEAKER_06]: So it gets a 10.

1381
01:47:57,544 --> 01:48:00,925
[SPEAKER_06]: This one's going to be Rob's song.

1382
01:48:01,166 --> 01:48:02,887
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob was going to use this in another week.

1383
01:48:03,187 --> 01:48:04,908
[SPEAKER_06]: So don't be getting pissed off at me.

1384
01:48:04,948 --> 01:48:06,048
[SPEAKER_06]: This is all Rob.

1385
01:48:06,409 --> 01:48:07,309
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all his fault.

1386
01:48:07,609 --> 01:48:09,671
[SPEAKER_06]: He's acting all innocent, but it was all him.

1387
01:48:11,271 --> 01:48:12,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Besides, the Flash video is much better.

1388
01:48:15,154 --> 01:48:15,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Floatwalk.

1389
01:48:16,744 --> 01:48:18,606
[SPEAKER_26]: Wow, I didn't even know PapaSwerve was black.

1390
01:48:20,628 --> 01:48:25,452
[SPEAKER_26]: That said, yeah, that said, I got two words for it.

1391
01:48:25,612 --> 01:48:25,973
[SPEAKER_26]: Solo 2005.

1392
01:48:26,253 --> 01:48:29,176
[SPEAKER_26]: On a scale of one to ten?

1393
01:48:30,437 --> 01:48:36,282
[SPEAKER_26]: Let's see, well, if we're talking booties, I think an eight kind of looks like a booty, you know, if you tilt it sideways.

1394
01:48:36,342 --> 01:48:37,784
[SPEAKER_26]: So, yeah, I'm going to give it an eight.

1395
01:48:38,104 --> 01:48:39,145
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1396
01:48:39,265 --> 01:48:39,825
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

1397
01:48:40,026 --> 01:48:42,428
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to put that in the cage match, but...

1398
01:48:43,052 --> 01:48:43,552
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1399
01:49:13,537 --> 01:49:15,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, DDR Angel.

1400
01:49:15,118 --> 01:49:17,398
[SPEAKER_04]: DDR Angel, what do you think?

1401
01:49:17,818 --> 01:49:19,999
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's see, Comedial Factor 6.

1402
01:49:22,240 --> 01:49:23,040
[SPEAKER_27]: Explicit.

1403
01:49:25,481 --> 01:49:27,962
[SPEAKER_27]: Uh, no fucking comment.

1404
01:49:28,342 --> 01:49:37,845
[SPEAKER_27]: Uh, I'll just give it a question mark, because it all depends on what people... Okay, I'll give it an 8, equal sign 3.

1405
01:49:37,885 --> 01:49:39,365
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, 8 equals 3 from Jonas.

1406
01:49:42,877 --> 01:49:45,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, LankyStyle, did you have a vote?

1407
01:49:47,500 --> 01:49:53,864
[SPEAKER_05]: I think what I have to say is that Poppa Smurf should watch out because I'm sure she licked all the other Smurfs' asses before she got to him.

1408
01:49:56,126 --> 01:49:57,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I give it an 8.

1409
01:49:58,587 --> 01:50:02,650
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's a great song and all, but gag factor is basically all.

1410
01:50:02,690 --> 01:50:03,851
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, comedy, 10.

1411
01:50:04,751 --> 01:50:05,772
[SPEAKER_05]: Song is a whole 8.

1412
01:50:07,793 --> 01:50:10,295
[SPEAKER_18]: That song reminds me of a fanfic that my, uh,

1413
01:50:11,064 --> 01:50:14,125
[SPEAKER_18]: Roommate from college had printed out on that.

1414
01:50:14,145 --> 01:50:19,406
[SPEAKER_18]: You remember back in the days when printer paper was all green and white and had the tearing edges on the side?

1415
01:50:20,026 --> 01:50:23,867
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, my friend went to the computer lab at my school.

1416
01:50:23,907 --> 01:50:25,647
[SPEAKER_18]: This is in 1995, mind you.

1417
01:50:26,467 --> 01:50:28,328
[SPEAKER_18]: Printed up the Smuck Fest.

1418
01:50:29,388 --> 01:50:33,629
[SPEAKER_18]: Someone had written a Lemon fanfic about the Smurfs getting it on.

1419
01:50:34,741 --> 01:50:35,181
[SPEAKER_04]: Gross.

1420
01:50:35,221 --> 01:50:35,942
[SPEAKER_18]: It was scary.

1421
01:50:36,222 --> 01:50:37,944
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's what that song makes me think of.

1422
01:50:38,124 --> 01:50:40,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's wrap this up so we can get past this topic.

1423
01:50:40,086 --> 01:50:40,827
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got one more.

1424
01:50:41,107 --> 01:50:44,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have an online name, Honda, I should refer to you as, or just Loki's sister?

1425
01:50:46,612 --> 01:50:47,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Gypsy Wolf.

1426
01:50:47,593 --> 01:50:49,435
[SPEAKER_04]: What would you give that, Gypsy Wolf?

1427
01:50:50,015 --> 01:50:51,116
[SPEAKER_07]: I love that song.

1428
01:50:51,337 --> 01:50:53,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Having seen the animation for it, I have to say a 10.

1429
01:50:54,780 --> 01:50:55,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow, a 10.

1430
01:50:56,942 --> 01:50:57,983
[SPEAKER_04]: You're easy to please.

1431
01:50:58,063 --> 01:50:59,384
[SPEAKER_04]: You gave two 10s tonight.

1432
01:50:59,404 --> 01:51:00,145
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, that's all right.

1433
01:51:02,186 --> 01:51:04,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's review so you guys can vote.

1434
01:51:04,068 --> 01:51:04,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

1435
01:51:04,708 --> 01:51:09,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Song number one, last week's winner, Bond with Shine, the dub Chakra Mix.

1436
01:51:18,038 --> 01:51:21,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Song number two is Echo Image with Standing Alone.

1437
01:51:30,971 --> 01:51:34,453
[SPEAKER_04]: and song number three is Papa Smurf, Can I Lick Your Ass.

1438
01:51:42,639 --> 01:51:46,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, place, vote, now.

1439
01:51:46,681 --> 01:51:50,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.

1440
01:51:52,248 --> 01:51:56,489
[SPEAKER_04]: And we will tally up those votes very shortly and let you know who won tonight's cage match.

1441
01:51:56,569 --> 01:51:58,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me, uh... Oh!

1442
01:51:58,529 --> 01:52:01,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie already beat me to the place vote now thing, so... Thank you, Jamie.

1443
01:52:03,170 --> 01:52:06,091
[SPEAKER_18]: Moving on... You are welcome!

1444
01:52:06,331 --> 01:52:08,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on, let's, uh... Loki, why don't you give us a sim update?

1445
01:52:09,012 --> 01:52:10,052
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going on in the sim world?

1446
01:52:10,072 --> 01:52:13,433
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know you've built your own thing, and I know there's food mix news, all sorts of fun stuff.

1447
01:52:16,653 --> 01:52:18,474
[SPEAKER_06]: Well... Uh... Ooh!

1448
01:52:18,794 --> 01:52:18,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Done.

1449
01:52:19,274 --> 01:52:19,954
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, anyways, um...

1450
01:52:21,064 --> 01:52:25,406
[SPEAKER_06]: No, there's another, I think... I can't remember if this was last week or this week.

1451
01:52:25,966 --> 01:52:27,566
[SPEAKER_06]: There's another update to Techno Fiend.

1452
01:52:27,666 --> 01:52:28,347
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks nice.

1453
01:52:28,647 --> 01:52:29,847
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got some cool stuff in it.

1454
01:52:31,688 --> 01:52:32,488
[SPEAKER_13]: What's Techno Fiend?

1455
01:52:32,908 --> 01:52:35,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Techno Fiend is a... Excuse me.

1456
01:52:36,610 --> 01:52:40,211
[SPEAKER_06]: Techno Fiend is a new Step Mania skin that's nice looking.

1457
01:52:40,751 --> 01:52:43,492
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very... They do a lot of cool stuff to it.

1458
01:52:44,472 --> 01:52:47,694
[SPEAKER_06]: Plus it has the Ridge Racer and Game Over thing, which is kind of cool too.

1459
01:52:48,254 --> 01:52:48,634
[SPEAKER_06]: But, um...

1460
01:52:49,793 --> 01:52:52,934
[SPEAKER_06]: They have, it looks nice, so that's what I have on the cabinet right now.

1461
01:52:53,375 --> 01:52:58,117
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, it would have worked better had the cabinet, like, not broken itself, but anyways.

1462
01:52:58,297 --> 01:53:04,980
[SPEAKER_06]: Other than that, it was just announced this week that Food Mix Plus had hidden content in it.

1463
01:53:06,173 --> 01:53:10,057
[SPEAKER_06]: And now I have on our website how you can get to that hidden content.

1464
01:53:10,097 --> 01:53:20,786
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically there is a dummy file in one of the directories there and you turn that into a zip file and you get a brand new song, new steps for some of the older songs, and new Oni courses.

1465
01:53:21,267 --> 01:53:22,448
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's pretty cool.

1466
01:53:24,690 --> 01:53:27,272
[SPEAKER_06]: And then other than that...

1467
01:53:27,592 --> 01:53:28,873
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's really not that much else.

1468
01:53:28,993 --> 01:53:38,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, oh, no, no, it should be mentioned, the first pack of ripped characters from DDR5thMix has surfaced online.

1469
01:53:38,258 --> 01:53:40,960
[SPEAKER_06]: You can find the link on DDRmaniaX for that one.

1470
01:53:41,460 --> 01:53:42,621
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're pretty nice looking.

1471
01:53:42,741 --> 01:53:49,245
[SPEAKER_06]: They're ripped directly from the DDR games because the guy that, he built his own software to do that kind of stuff, so that's kind of neat.

1472
01:53:50,105 --> 01:54:15,463
[SPEAKER_06]: and, um, other than that, really, um, not too much else, uh, DDROSC3's going on right now, I think the first pack of songs has been released for that, um, and I know DDR, um, the remix contest on Bumai Style and, um, DDR Maniacs, I think, are up already, they're done, they should be posting those, uh, those songs online for voting soon, and I think that's all, yeah.

1473
01:54:17,185 --> 01:54:17,505
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1474
01:54:18,339 --> 01:54:19,821
[SPEAKER_06]: You need a mic, because we're not going to hear you.

1475
01:54:21,463 --> 01:54:24,646
[SPEAKER_27]: Have they added a comment section on Be My Install already for The Sims?

1476
01:54:25,888 --> 01:54:26,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, yeah.

1477
01:54:26,188 --> 01:54:27,149
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you could, that's new.

1478
01:54:27,169 --> 01:54:27,950
[SPEAKER_06]: They already have that.

1479
01:54:28,611 --> 01:54:30,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because I just noticed about that.

1480
01:54:31,274 --> 01:54:32,376
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, but that's all that's going on.

1481
01:54:33,557 --> 01:54:33,797
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.

1482
01:54:37,972 --> 01:54:40,314
[SPEAKER_04]: When a radio show calls out,

1483
01:55:06,308 --> 01:55:08,509
[SPEAKER_05]: That means you're a shock jock and you're doing stupid bits.

1484
01:55:10,249 --> 01:55:11,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Is your refrigerator running?

1485
01:55:13,630 --> 01:55:14,491
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hey, Siggy, what's up?

1486
01:55:15,491 --> 01:55:19,452
[SPEAKER_22]: I thought you were going to scat me after Cage Match.

1487
01:55:19,592 --> 01:55:20,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the Cage Match is done.

1488
01:55:20,613 --> 01:55:21,513
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just waiting for the votes.

1489
01:55:22,113 --> 01:55:22,733
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, okay.

1490
01:55:22,833 --> 01:55:23,093
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1491
01:55:23,373 --> 01:55:32,496
[SPEAKER_04]: So tell me what you know about these new 8-style limited editions and stuff because I haven't really been following it because I can barely keep track of what's going on domestically, let alone importly.

1492
01:55:32,576 --> 01:55:34,437
[SPEAKER_04]: So share what you know with us, would you?

1493
01:55:35,083 --> 01:55:38,865
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, here's what I've known so far about 2DX 8-Style Special Edition.

1494
01:55:39,745 --> 01:55:45,188
[SPEAKER_22]: They have, well, along with 8-Style, they have a 2DX Red e-amusement card.

1495
01:55:45,288 --> 01:55:50,690
[SPEAKER_22]: It's going to be random, so we'll never know what's inside each art cover for that.

1496
01:55:52,171 --> 01:55:54,932
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, they have a 2DX Visual Emotion DVD.

1497
01:55:55,533 --> 01:55:56,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I can't wait for that DVD.

1498
01:55:57,554 --> 01:55:57,874
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

1499
01:55:59,494 --> 01:55:59,895
[SPEAKER_22]: Let me see.

1500
01:56:00,095 --> 01:56:01,635
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm reading the translation right now.

1501
01:56:02,496 --> 01:56:04,877
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, they have the 8-Style V-Rare Soundtrack

1502
01:56:05,822 --> 01:56:07,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, an 8-style V-Rare, really?

1503
01:56:08,024 --> 01:56:08,285
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

1504
01:56:08,665 --> 01:56:09,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that should be cool, okay.

1505
01:56:10,487 --> 01:56:20,896
[SPEAKER_22]: And then the 8-style special edition, special made box, like a, you know, like a box for stacking your preview styles from, you know, from 5th, 6th, 7th, or whatever.

1506
01:56:21,256 --> 01:56:21,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Very nice.

1507
01:56:22,738 --> 01:56:25,260
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, and then, of course, here's still a little bit interesting.

1508
01:56:25,721 --> 01:56:28,503
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a BeatMe2DX-style mail magazine.

1509
01:56:29,724 --> 01:56:31,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Like M-A-I-L or M-A-L-E?

1510
01:56:33,306 --> 01:56:34,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, darn.

1511
01:56:37,169 --> 01:56:37,610
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1512
01:56:38,230 --> 01:56:40,752
[SPEAKER_04]: And with any other information on what's going to be on that magazine?

1513
01:56:41,333 --> 01:56:41,473
[SPEAKER_22]: Huh.

1514
01:56:41,493 --> 01:56:42,113
[SPEAKER_22]: We're losing you.

1515
01:56:42,174 --> 01:56:43,435
[SPEAKER_22]: Speak into the mic a little more.

1516
01:56:43,455 --> 01:56:44,876
[SPEAKER_22]: We're losing you.

1517
01:56:44,896 --> 01:56:45,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

1518
01:56:45,717 --> 01:56:45,997
[SPEAKER_22]: D'oh.

1519
01:56:46,037 --> 01:56:47,258
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, well, maybe we can get a hookup.

1520
01:56:47,278 --> 01:56:47,518
[SPEAKER_22]: Who knows?

1521
01:56:47,538 --> 01:56:47,718
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

1522
01:57:01,243 --> 01:57:02,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well thanks for sharing that.

1523
01:57:02,444 --> 01:57:03,784
[SPEAKER_04]: We were curious what was going on with that.

1524
01:57:05,585 --> 01:57:10,128
[SPEAKER_22]: I checked on the Web Konami website for TJXHL.

1525
01:57:10,148 --> 01:57:19,033
[SPEAKER_22]: The price is about 106,000 yen, which is, I think, or actually 10,479 yen, including tax.

1526
01:57:19,233 --> 01:57:19,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

1527
01:57:20,514 --> 01:57:22,495
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds like a lot, but it's not quite that bad.

1528
01:57:22,835 --> 01:57:26,657
[SPEAKER_22]: It's approximately $130, according to NTSX.com.

1529
01:57:27,017 --> 01:57:27,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1530
01:57:28,038 --> 01:57:29,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'll be looking forward to it.

1531
01:57:29,399 --> 01:57:30,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for the update, Siggy.

1532
01:57:31,311 --> 01:57:31,772
[SPEAKER_06]: No problem.

1533
01:57:31,972 --> 01:57:32,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, take care bud.

1534
01:57:33,353 --> 01:57:33,594
Later.

1535
01:57:33,934 --> 01:57:34,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Later.

1536
01:57:35,335 --> 01:57:38,178
[SPEAKER_04]: That's also known as DarkLionXVI.

1537
01:57:38,198 --> 01:57:40,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Some more information on 2DXA style.

1538
01:57:40,921 --> 01:57:41,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.

1539
01:57:42,723 --> 01:57:44,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to clear up something from our chat room.

1540
01:57:44,604 --> 01:57:48,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey Orange Launch Radio, if I'm not correct, isn't this the first time you've ever called out?

1541
01:57:48,408 --> 01:57:49,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually it is not.

1542
01:57:49,642 --> 01:57:50,543
[SPEAKER_11]: No, we've called out before.

1543
01:58:20,706 --> 01:58:27,473
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh yeah, like when people tell you, you know, are you getting cold, are you getting hot, I will say, someone in the room is pretty freaking hot.

1544
01:58:28,715 --> 01:58:30,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Mmm, very interesting.

1545
01:58:30,977 --> 01:58:31,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know I'm hot.

1546
01:58:31,658 --> 01:58:33,720
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not talking about myself either, but.

1547
01:58:34,561 --> 01:58:35,722
[SPEAKER_18]: Some of us just can't help it.

1548
01:58:37,584 --> 01:58:39,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my, all right.

1549
01:58:40,344 --> 01:58:42,245
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to go to a break pretty soon.

1550
01:58:42,305 --> 01:58:48,986
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're just going to do a bunch of random songs in this next break, so we'll probably do that.

1551
01:58:53,507 --> 01:58:56,528
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got to find those songs, though, so somebody has to help me fill time.

1552
01:58:56,548 --> 01:58:57,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's going to help fill time?

1553
01:58:58,048 --> 01:58:59,489
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh-oh.

1554
01:59:01,669 --> 01:59:03,710
[SPEAKER_06]: I've had, how many shots now?

1555
01:59:04,730 --> 01:59:09,271
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, well, I'm almost out of this glass, so that would be six shots, yeah.

1556
01:59:10,899 --> 01:59:12,700
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm feeling okay, but a little dizzy.

1557
01:59:12,900 --> 01:59:14,060
[SPEAKER_06]: A little slightly dizzy.

1558
01:59:17,041 --> 01:59:17,641
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what?

1559
01:59:18,461 --> 01:59:19,401
[SPEAKER_06]: Not really, actually.

1560
01:59:19,421 --> 01:59:20,502
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not feeling that warm.

1561
01:59:21,302 --> 01:59:22,702
[SPEAKER_18]: If it were a cheat night, it would be on.

1562
01:59:23,723 --> 01:59:29,224
[SPEAKER_18]: I need to sit down with someone with some either dark rum or tequila and just do shots.

1563
01:59:36,746 --> 01:59:37,186
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

1564
01:59:41,218 --> 01:59:45,939
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, other than that, let's see, what else can I talk about?

1565
01:59:46,679 --> 01:59:47,879
[SPEAKER_18]: I should have brought my amaretto for you.

1566
01:59:49,659 --> 01:59:52,060
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, actually, where's Gypsy Wolf?

1567
01:59:52,240 --> 01:59:53,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the chat room is reminding me of something.

1568
01:59:53,840 --> 01:59:56,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Gypsy Wolf, we need embarrassing Loki stories.

1569
01:59:58,441 --> 01:59:59,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we give you a couple minutes?

1570
01:59:59,561 --> 02:00:00,841
[SPEAKER_04]: I suppose we can give you a couple minutes.

1571
02:00:00,861 --> 02:00:01,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, in the meantime, Loki.

1572
02:00:02,742 --> 02:00:04,322
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll do embarrassing Loki stories after the break.

1573
02:00:04,642 --> 02:00:06,242
[SPEAKER_04]: We do have to get into the FUs of the week soon, though.

1574
02:00:07,502 --> 02:00:10,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you guys want to hear who won tonight's cage match, actually?

1575
02:00:12,083 --> 02:00:12,663
[SPEAKER_18]: I guess.

1576
02:00:13,204 --> 02:00:14,244
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get to it in a minute.

1577
02:00:14,524 --> 02:00:19,207
[SPEAKER_04]: But I will tell you that one song just like obliterated the competition.

1578
02:00:19,527 --> 02:00:21,107
[SPEAKER_04]: It totally blew the competition out of the water.

1579
02:00:21,147 --> 02:00:22,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you guess what song it is?

1580
02:00:24,769 --> 02:00:26,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Which song would you guys think it is that obliterated the others?

1581
02:00:28,351 --> 02:00:28,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Papa Smurf.

1582
02:00:28,991 --> 02:00:29,592
[SPEAKER_18]: Papa Smurf.

1583
02:00:29,612 --> 02:00:29,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Papa Smurf.

1584
02:00:30,012 --> 02:00:30,432
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think?

1585
02:00:31,312 --> 02:00:34,374
[SPEAKER_18]: Because our listeners tend to go for the gross potty humor.

1586
02:00:35,249 --> 02:00:39,432
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, how else did Loki win a cage match by singing I'm Staying In?

1587
02:00:39,952 --> 02:00:43,094
[SPEAKER_04]: Here is tonight's winner of the Orange Lounge cage match.

1588
02:00:48,937 --> 02:00:50,918
[SPEAKER_18]: Chatroom, you have restored my faith in you.

1589
02:00:51,158 --> 02:00:51,779
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1590
02:00:52,479 --> 02:00:53,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Very nice.

1591
02:00:53,320 --> 02:00:57,542
[SPEAKER_04]: An upset there by Echo Image winning tonight's cage match with Standing Alone.

1592
02:00:58,723 --> 02:01:00,504
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm still getting my revenge next week.

1593
02:01:00,564 --> 02:01:03,025
[SPEAKER_04]: About twice the votes that Bond got.

1594
02:01:03,365 --> 02:01:04,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Papa Smurf

1595
02:01:04,693 --> 02:01:07,915
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1596
02:01:36,007 --> 02:01:36,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

1597
02:01:38,807 --> 02:01:41,788
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still trying to prep for the next break because there's songs I'm looking for.

1598
02:01:41,808 --> 02:01:44,289
[SPEAKER_04]: A little random mix of songs I want to play for you, certainly.

1599
02:01:44,949 --> 02:01:46,530
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to know who that one person was.

1600
02:01:46,950 --> 02:01:47,590
[SPEAKER_04]: What one person?

1601
02:01:47,910 --> 02:01:48,891
[SPEAKER_18]: The one person who voted.

1602
02:01:49,211 --> 02:01:53,312
[SPEAKER_04]: I would share, but I'll let them reveal their identity in the chat room if they want to.

1603
02:01:53,332 --> 02:02:00,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, free... Mel says a free Max 2 be rare.

1604
02:02:00,974 --> 02:02:02,555
[SPEAKER_04]: A Max 2 or an Extreme?

1605
02:02:02,575 --> 02:02:02,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Max 2.

1606
02:02:03,425 --> 02:02:04,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, he only says Max, too.

1607
02:02:04,465 --> 02:02:05,946
[SPEAKER_04]: I ain't that stupid.

1608
02:02:05,966 --> 02:02:06,926
[SPEAKER_04]: I ain't that stupid.

1609
02:02:07,207 --> 02:02:07,807
[SPEAKER_04]: How's it going?

1610
02:02:07,847 --> 02:02:10,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I might have fallen for that, because I would have been all, ooh, V-Rare.

1611
02:02:10,548 --> 02:02:13,409
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll just throw a giant papier-mâché V at them.

1612
02:02:14,390 --> 02:02:14,710
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1613
02:02:15,030 --> 02:02:15,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, guys.

1614
02:02:16,110 --> 02:02:16,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, guys.

1615
02:02:16,530 --> 02:02:20,312
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't take requests this break, because we have songs we really, really want to play for you guys.

1616
02:02:20,832 --> 02:02:21,813
[SPEAKER_04]: And here we go.

1617
02:02:22,213 --> 02:02:27,695
[SPEAKER_04]: We will be right back with more Orange Launch Radio and the FUs of the week coming up when we get back as well.

1618
02:02:27,735 --> 02:02:28,675
[SPEAKER_04]: But please don't send those in yet.

1619
02:02:28,695 --> 02:02:29,356
[SPEAKER_06]: And more clues?

1620
02:02:29,556 --> 02:02:30,036
[SPEAKER_06]: More clues?

1621
02:02:30,899 --> 02:02:34,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe, but send in those guesses right now.

1622
02:02:35,434 --> 02:02:36,899
[SPEAKER_04]: The clues never stop here on Orange Launch Radio.

1623
02:02:36,919 --> 02:02:37,281
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be back.

1624
02:03:50,922 --> 02:03:51,705
[SPEAKER_09]: GF GF

1625
02:03:58,317 --> 02:03:59,178
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for watching!

1626
02:04:28,357 --> 02:04:29,118
Thanks for watching!

1627
02:04:53,190 --> 02:05:06,573
[SPEAKER_00]: I now sway, like they used to do, with a house beat to it, and before I'm through, you might learn a thing or two, you can show your piece, and you can catch me on Soul Train late next week, don't you know I'm all that, and a bucket of wings, I'm on the jabs, when I feel the need to shake my good thing, when you see me coming, sit back, relax, stay

1628
02:05:44,323 --> 02:05:45,124
Thanks for watching!

1629
02:06:47,274 --> 02:07:02,183
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

1630
02:07:10,008 --> 02:07:11,849
[SPEAKER_04]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1631
02:07:12,590 --> 02:07:12,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Logie.

1632
02:07:13,820 --> 02:07:15,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Hallelujah, it's raining men.

1633
02:07:16,961 --> 02:07:30,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on, we are, speaking of things that have been coming over me, private message, we have some more guesses for the song that we've been trying to guess all night long.

1634
02:07:31,427 --> 02:07:34,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Mel, it starts off with, I'm sorry, Float, it starts off with this one.

1635
02:07:35,034 --> 02:07:36,595
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a good one from El Mullet.

1636
02:07:36,655 --> 02:07:39,896
[SPEAKER_04]: The guess is Divine Sweet Divide by Tanya Donoli.

1637
02:07:39,936 --> 02:07:40,516
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is why.

1638
02:07:40,916 --> 02:07:43,697
[SPEAKER_04]: The jam on the bagel is sweet and cells divide.

1639
02:07:44,397 --> 02:07:45,358
[SPEAKER_26]: Too abstract, sorry.

1640
02:07:45,638 --> 02:07:46,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, a little bit too abstract.

1641
02:07:48,078 --> 02:07:49,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a bad guess there.

1642
02:07:49,759 --> 02:07:50,939
[SPEAKER_26]: I like the way you're thinking.

1643
02:07:51,059 --> 02:07:52,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I like the way you're thinking too.

1644
02:07:52,900 --> 02:07:56,441
[SPEAKER_04]: John Fields says, Cytoplasm by WND Games.

1645
02:07:56,541 --> 02:07:58,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Cytoplasm is unique in all cells.

1646
02:07:58,462 --> 02:08:00,323
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, it holds everything inside a cell.

1647
02:08:00,583 --> 02:08:04,104
[SPEAKER_04]: And a cell always has a nucleus, which is round like a donut hole.

1648
02:08:05,049 --> 02:08:05,910
[SPEAKER_26]: Sold!

1649
02:08:06,610 --> 02:08:07,071
[SPEAKER_26]: Not quite.

1650
02:08:08,792 --> 02:08:14,777
[SPEAKER_26]: Although probably right now with these guesses I'm probably relearning everything I forgot in physiology, man.

1651
02:08:16,138 --> 02:08:17,199
[SPEAKER_26]: I sucked at biology.

1652
02:08:17,540 --> 02:08:19,541
[SPEAKER_26]: Except, you know, when we talked about the reproductive system.

1653
02:08:19,621 --> 02:08:20,742
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh yeah, I aced that sucker.

1654
02:08:22,564 --> 02:08:24,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that's all the guesses so far.

1655
02:08:25,126 --> 02:08:25,746
[SPEAKER_26]: That's all?

1656
02:08:26,347 --> 02:08:27,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's it so far.

1657
02:08:27,688 --> 02:08:28,869
[SPEAKER_26]: My goodness.

1658
02:08:31,331 --> 02:08:32,212
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see you a little later.

1659
02:08:33,118 --> 02:08:34,298
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll open it up for more guesses.

1660
02:08:34,318 --> 02:08:41,079
[SPEAKER_26]: Like I said, guys, I mentioned before the last music bed, someone in the room is very hot on its trail.

1661
02:08:41,219 --> 02:08:45,520
[SPEAKER_04]: After that last batch, somebody else is just, like, smoking, honestly.

1662
02:08:45,600 --> 02:08:48,241
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, just thinking a little too far into it.

1663
02:08:48,401 --> 02:08:49,161
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the only problem.

1664
02:08:50,081 --> 02:08:52,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you honestly clue me into what we're talking about?

1665
02:08:53,421 --> 02:08:53,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up.

1666
02:08:56,142 --> 02:08:56,602
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1667
02:08:58,962 --> 02:08:59,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

1668
02:08:59,382 --> 02:09:01,723
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we should do the FUs of the week now.

1669
02:09:01,743 --> 02:09:02,303
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you guys think?

1670
02:09:04,676 --> 02:09:05,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we don't have to.

1671
02:09:05,396 --> 02:09:08,038
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, we can just sit here.

1672
02:09:08,158 --> 02:09:09,698
[SPEAKER_18]: Damn it, I need to vent.

1673
02:09:09,918 --> 02:09:10,278
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

1674
02:09:10,319 --> 02:09:10,779
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm sorry.

1675
02:09:10,819 --> 02:09:13,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Before we vent, though, where's Gypsy Wolf?

1676
02:09:13,820 --> 02:09:16,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the chat room is begging for more Loki stories.

1677
02:09:16,761 --> 02:09:18,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, could you please leave the room for a minute?

1678
02:09:19,242 --> 02:09:19,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye, Loki.

1679
02:09:20,003 --> 02:09:20,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, bye.

1680
02:09:21,043 --> 02:09:21,503
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Loki.

1681
02:09:21,824 --> 02:09:22,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye, Loki.

1682
02:09:22,944 --> 02:09:24,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Nellie, can you take him to the bedroom?

1683
02:09:24,305 --> 02:09:24,885
[SPEAKER_07]: No, what's the worst?

1684
02:09:24,925 --> 02:09:26,286
[SPEAKER_07]: All he's going to do is object to things.

1685
02:09:26,546 --> 02:09:27,306
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, all right, yeah.

1686
02:09:27,546 --> 02:09:29,007
[SPEAKER_04]: He won't have a microphone, so it won't matter.

1687
02:09:29,447 --> 02:09:33,949
[SPEAKER_04]: So, any funny childhood stories from Loki?

1688
02:09:34,720 --> 02:09:37,963
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, well, okay, anybody's familiar with Construx?

1689
02:09:38,683 --> 02:09:41,465
[SPEAKER_07]: The building toys that you kind of snap together, they have those little blue things?

1690
02:09:41,966 --> 02:09:42,746
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever, okay.

1691
02:09:42,986 --> 02:09:50,972
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, one thing that, you know, I used to do would be, this was also before I was, no, this was after I was born, but I was too young to remember most of it.

1692
02:09:51,032 --> 02:09:52,913
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw pictures my mom showed me, so, anyway.

1693
02:09:53,314 --> 02:09:57,757
[SPEAKER_07]: But you would build power suits out of the Construx and run around the house with them.

1694
02:09:59,838 --> 02:10:01,800
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, shoot the dog, whatever was cool.

1695
02:10:02,560 --> 02:10:06,201
[SPEAKER_07]: But, I don't know, I can't really remember all that.

1696
02:10:06,481 --> 02:10:09,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, the one that was the best thing, I love this, this wasn't embarrassing, this was just fun.

1697
02:10:10,843 --> 02:10:13,623
[SPEAKER_07]: It was Mission Control with our dog.

1698
02:10:14,644 --> 02:10:24,707
[SPEAKER_07]: And Matt would, Loki would sit there and he would, our dog, our Labrador, would walk around the house and do stuff, eat, drink, etc., her normal thing.

1699
02:10:25,450 --> 02:10:29,372
[SPEAKER_07]: and he would say, Houston, we are taking in water and she would drink or whatever.

1700
02:10:29,412 --> 02:10:39,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, I would do the ground control at NASA's commentary on everything that my dog was doing as if it were some sort of spaceship or something.

1701
02:10:40,056 --> 02:10:42,417
[SPEAKER_06]: It made people crack up like crazy and it was funny.

1702
02:10:43,617 --> 02:10:47,238
[SPEAKER_07]: It was great when she was downloading cargo and taking a dump out back.

1703
02:10:47,939 --> 02:10:48,299
[SPEAKER_07]: It was great.

1704
02:10:49,682 --> 02:10:51,564
[SPEAKER_07]: Jettisoning, fuel, urinating, you know?

1705
02:10:51,584 --> 02:10:52,325
[SPEAKER_06]: My dog is awesome.

1706
02:10:52,525 --> 02:10:53,406
[SPEAKER_06]: Too bad she's dead.

1707
02:10:54,207 --> 02:10:58,131
[SPEAKER_07]: Pets are cool, but, you know, I mean... That is so wrong.

1708
02:11:00,053 --> 02:11:01,094
[SPEAKER_06]: What else do they used to do?

1709
02:11:01,574 --> 02:11:03,776
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, we have, like, um... What else was it?

1710
02:11:04,637 --> 02:11:05,318
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't remember much.

1711
02:11:05,518 --> 02:11:06,919
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we did a lot with Marbleworks.

1712
02:11:07,500 --> 02:11:09,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Did a lot of crap with that, put water down them and shit.

1713
02:11:10,563 --> 02:11:13,446
[SPEAKER_07]: We hit Army Men and Mom's Ficus Tree.

1714
02:11:14,847 --> 02:11:16,868
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I remember now.

1715
02:11:16,908 --> 02:11:23,353
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a water balloon launcher and I used to launch tennis balls at the people on the bike trail over the green belt from us.

1716
02:11:23,833 --> 02:11:27,275
[SPEAKER_06]: It was cool because you can hit those people from 200 yards away.

1717
02:11:27,755 --> 02:11:31,678
[SPEAKER_06]: And we got lucky one time and we hit a guy and he fell over and that was funny.

1718
02:11:32,118 --> 02:11:32,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that was that.

1719
02:11:32,979 --> 02:11:38,002
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there was those little paratrooper guys you could do where you could get army men and strap parachutes to them on really windy days.

1720
02:11:38,042 --> 02:11:39,123
[SPEAKER_07]: They'd fly right over the house.

1721
02:11:39,443 --> 02:11:40,344
[SPEAKER_07]: You could watch them go.

1722
02:11:40,804 --> 02:11:41,464
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, goodbye!

1723
02:11:41,684 --> 02:11:43,005
[SPEAKER_07]: Melted quite a few army men too.

1724
02:11:43,025 --> 02:11:43,626
[SPEAKER_07]: That was kind of cool.

1725
02:11:43,646 --> 02:11:43,726
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1726
02:11:46,172 --> 02:11:47,113
[SPEAKER_07]: How many poopy stories?

1727
02:11:47,193 --> 02:11:49,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Did he ever shit himself or anything?

1728
02:11:49,755 --> 02:11:52,297
[SPEAKER_06]: I ate dog food as a kid.

1729
02:11:52,838 --> 02:11:54,699
[SPEAKER_07]: He ate a whole entire bowl of gravy train.

1730
02:11:54,959 --> 02:11:56,741
[SPEAKER_07]: Gravy from ear to ear when he was a kid.

1731
02:11:56,841 --> 02:11:58,202
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, it had meat in it, okay?

1732
02:11:58,282 --> 02:12:00,303
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's good enough for the dog, it's good enough for me.

1733
02:12:01,264 --> 02:12:02,025
[SPEAKER_07]: Give me meat!

1734
02:12:03,506 --> 02:12:04,447
[SPEAKER_07]: Dog's like, what the hell?

1735
02:12:04,487 --> 02:12:05,327
[SPEAKER_07]: Where'd my food go?

1736
02:12:05,888 --> 02:12:07,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well thank you for sharing those with us.

1737
02:12:07,549 --> 02:12:13,594
[SPEAKER_04]: We needed some good embarrassing Loki stories, so... They weren't that bad, but they were still funny.

1738
02:12:13,754 --> 02:12:14,774
[SPEAKER_08]: They were cute.

1739
02:12:14,795 --> 02:12:15,175
[SPEAKER_04]: They were cute.

1740
02:12:16,033 --> 02:12:19,394
[SPEAKER_06]: I killed a man with a trident through his chest.

1741
02:12:21,894 --> 02:12:23,494
[SPEAKER_06]: It's from Anchorman, I'm sorry.

1742
02:12:24,955 --> 02:12:25,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1743
02:12:26,815 --> 02:12:27,235
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1744
02:12:28,475 --> 02:12:28,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1745
02:12:29,395 --> 02:12:29,915
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.

1746
02:12:29,935 --> 02:12:30,355
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing.

1747
02:12:30,596 --> 02:12:30,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1748
02:12:31,516 --> 02:12:36,757
[SPEAKER_11]: Then I think it's... Do you have pictures?

1749
02:12:37,177 --> 02:12:38,197
[SPEAKER_06]: They have pictures too.

1750
02:12:38,257 --> 02:12:40,277
[SPEAKER_06]: It's in my photo album somewhere.

1751
02:12:40,677 --> 02:12:41,217
[SPEAKER_06]: My baby photo album.

1752
02:12:41,237 --> 02:12:42,618
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there a name we can call you, Alpo?

1753
02:12:44,078 --> 02:12:44,538
[SPEAKER_06]: I think

1754
02:12:45,891 --> 02:12:46,091
[SPEAKER_18]: L3?

1755
02:12:46,171 --> 02:12:46,311
[SPEAKER_18]: No.

1756
02:13:18,004 --> 02:13:19,065
[SPEAKER_19]: Rob, sorry.

1757
02:13:19,625 --> 02:13:24,589
[SPEAKER_19]: I just had the worst idea ever, and no, this had nothing to do with Andrew, okay?

1758
02:13:25,889 --> 02:13:27,410
[SPEAKER_19]: Next remix for Loki.

1759
02:13:29,532 --> 02:13:32,954
[SPEAKER_19]: Long chain running, but he has to do something with dogs or something.

1760
02:13:34,255 --> 02:13:36,457
[SPEAKER_18]: He probably needs to do a remix of Disco Dog.

1761
02:13:36,917 --> 02:13:39,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, let's get into the FUs of the week.

1762
02:13:41,440 --> 02:13:45,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Jamie, why do we have to do the FUs of the week every single week on this show?

1763
02:13:45,543 --> 02:13:47,104
[SPEAKER_18]: Because we're full of to anger.

1764
02:13:55,543 --> 02:14:01,126
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, this is bad.

1765
02:14:02,587 --> 02:14:13,093
[SPEAKER_18]: An F you to John Fields for making me laugh while I have a headache for shiny disco dog balls.

1766
02:14:13,133 --> 02:14:16,414
[SPEAKER_18]: My first F you goes to the chat room for not guessing correctly.

1767
02:14:17,035 --> 02:14:18,215
[SPEAKER_18]: And not enough of you guessing.

1768
02:14:18,836 --> 02:14:20,737
[SPEAKER_18]: So, goddammit, guess.

1769
02:14:21,537 --> 02:14:22,298
[SPEAKER_18]: And to...

1770
02:14:23,191 --> 02:14:26,473
[SPEAKER_18]: Silent Ben for misspelling the word that you misspelled.

1771
02:14:28,734 --> 02:14:32,075
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a site called dictionary.com.

1772
02:14:36,978 --> 02:14:39,279
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, there's one called hyperdictionary.com.

1773
02:14:40,880 --> 02:14:41,920
[SPEAKER_18]: Just use it.

1774
02:14:42,620 --> 02:14:43,461
[SPEAKER_18]: Learn how to spell.

1775
02:14:43,581 --> 02:14:44,261
[SPEAKER_18]: Please, people.

1776
02:14:44,301 --> 02:14:44,982
[SPEAKER_18]: And learn grammar.

1777
02:14:45,502 --> 02:14:49,444
[SPEAKER_18]: And by the way, U is not spelled U. That is a letter.

1778
02:14:49,564 --> 02:14:49,804
[SPEAKER_18]: It's Y-O-U.

1779
02:14:52,449 --> 02:14:58,451
[SPEAKER_18]: Your is spelled Y-O-U apostrophe R-E or Y-O-U-R depending on the context you're using the word.

1780
02:14:58,711 --> 02:14:59,771
[SPEAKER_18]: Not you are!

1781
02:15:01,371 --> 02:15:01,711
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay?

1782
02:15:03,212 --> 02:15:07,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Now if they put apostrophe U, apostrophe U, then that would be okay.

1783
02:15:08,473 --> 02:15:09,533
[SPEAKER_18]: How would it be okay?

1784
02:15:10,074 --> 02:15:19,456
[SPEAKER_18]: Because an apostrophe is for if you're shortening a word, so... But there are only certain allowed abbreviations of words that are grammatically correct.

1785
02:15:23,706 --> 02:15:27,787
[SPEAKER_18]: that are commonly accepted by people who have been educated.

1786
02:15:28,147 --> 02:15:28,807
[SPEAKER_18]: That doesn't matter.

1787
02:15:28,827 --> 02:15:29,688
[SPEAKER_18]: Up to the third grade.

1788
02:15:29,868 --> 02:15:30,668
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not educated.

1789
02:15:30,688 --> 02:15:31,088
[SPEAKER_06]: We know that.

1790
02:15:33,709 --> 02:15:39,891
[SPEAKER_18]: And normally, normally I've gotten a whole, but I've gotten off of my whole Grammar Fiend kick.

1791
02:15:40,571 --> 02:15:43,652
[SPEAKER_18]: I got it, but I hit my saturation point sometimes.

1792
02:15:45,292 --> 02:15:51,754
[SPEAKER_18]: So, uh... Anyway, uh... Anyway...

1793
02:15:53,897 --> 02:16:01,960
[SPEAKER_18]: Another FU goes to the people on the road who are major assholes and don't know how to drive.

1794
02:16:03,400 --> 02:16:06,141
[SPEAKER_18]: Amazingly enough, my drive here was without incident.

1795
02:16:07,702 --> 02:16:16,385
[SPEAKER_18]: But a lot of my driving lately, especially to and from work, had been full of people who usually drive semis who don't know how to drive.

1796
02:16:18,905 --> 02:16:19,806
[SPEAKER_18]: Semis are cool.

1797
02:16:20,006 --> 02:16:23,167
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, I hate the ones that are like the trucks full of gravel.

1798
02:16:24,017 --> 02:16:25,398
[SPEAKER_15]: The gravel flies all the way out.

1799
02:16:25,658 --> 02:16:28,399
[SPEAKER_15]: I have a crack in my windshield now because of the freaking rock truck.

1800
02:16:29,260 --> 02:16:31,080
[SPEAKER_18]: It's like, you ass.

1801
02:16:31,381 --> 02:16:34,442
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's going to cost like $300 if I wanted to replace my windshield.

1802
02:16:34,462 --> 02:16:39,805
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, it's so minor that I can live with the look, but it's there and right in the corner of my vision.

1803
02:16:40,125 --> 02:16:41,726
[SPEAKER_18]: It's like, it's, there's, look.

1804
02:16:43,306 --> 02:16:45,107
[SPEAKER_18]: My car is already raped.

1805
02:16:45,447 --> 02:16:50,230
[SPEAKER_18]: And now I've got a crack, not a crack, but like, it's not a crack, it's a chip in the windshield is what it is.

1806
02:16:50,450 --> 02:16:51,410
[SPEAKER_18]: And, oh, piss me off.

1807
02:16:52,711 --> 02:16:52,891
[SPEAKER_18]: So,

1808
02:16:54,875 --> 02:16:58,677
[SPEAKER_18]: So another FU goes to the hot.

1809
02:17:00,078 --> 02:17:03,219
[SPEAKER_18]: I really dislike this part of living in Sacramento.

1810
02:17:03,559 --> 02:17:06,841
[SPEAKER_18]: I love the winter because I like the rain a whole lot.

1811
02:17:07,161 --> 02:17:09,062
[SPEAKER_18]: And I like that when I moved out here, it was raining.

1812
02:17:09,142 --> 02:17:11,103
[SPEAKER_18]: And I was like, oh, it's just like Alabama, yay.

1813
02:17:12,223 --> 02:17:17,486
[SPEAKER_18]: But anyway, it's just a pain in the ass.

1814
02:17:18,947 --> 02:17:20,327
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, we think this is getting all cool.

1815
02:17:21,128 --> 02:17:21,868
[SPEAKER_18]: And then it's hot.

1816
02:17:22,568 --> 02:17:23,509
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's like, what's up with that?

1817
02:17:24,145 --> 02:17:33,492
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, an FU goes to my apartment manager for me having told her weekly for the last month to fix my goddamn air conditioning and it's not fixed yet.

1818
02:17:34,172 --> 02:17:40,116
[SPEAKER_18]: And again, with it getting into triple digit heat and not having a working air conditioner, that's like a health hazard.

1819
02:17:40,456 --> 02:17:48,522
[SPEAKER_18]: You know in Arizona, if your apartment manager doesn't fix your air conditioning in your apartment, you can take them to court for it.

1820
02:17:50,083 --> 02:17:51,524
[SPEAKER_18]: And I wouldn't be surprised if you could do it here.

1821
02:17:51,544 --> 02:17:52,705
[SPEAKER_18]: This is fucked up.

1822
02:17:53,180 --> 02:18:02,244
[SPEAKER_18]: and seriously here, I mean, I honestly would have grounds for negligence because there is a statute that's referred to as duty of utmost care.

1823
02:18:06,586 --> 02:18:10,448
[SPEAKER_18]: And see, I know this because I'm taking business law right now, so don't fuck with me.

1824
02:18:12,289 --> 02:18:21,933
[SPEAKER_18]: But no, it's especially like for hotels, for people who run facilities, there's a duty of utmost care to provide services to tenants, to guests,

1825
02:18:23,226 --> 02:18:29,411
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, that they need to make sure that they provide a place that's going to be safe to live, safe to exist, you know, to operate in.

1826
02:18:29,552 --> 02:18:31,834
[SPEAKER_18]: And this is not, you know, safe.

1827
02:18:32,674 --> 02:18:38,259
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, when it gets up that hot and there's no way to keep cool, then that's dangerous.

1828
02:18:38,299 --> 02:18:38,940
[SPEAKER_18]: It's getting bad.

1829
02:18:40,681 --> 02:18:41,702
[SPEAKER_18]: Leave my foot alone.

1830
02:18:41,722 --> 02:18:42,983
[SPEAKER_11]: Another FU goes toward...

1831
02:18:52,347 --> 02:19:20,215
[SPEAKER_18]: American River College and this is why alright for anyone who's been paying attention to my live journal there's been the saga of my student loan check and see I work for my lender so I know where my money is I know when my funds have been dispersed I know how to do your job financial aid department at ARC I could do your job blindfolded so when I'm told that my check is mailed out last Friday

1832
02:19:21,448 --> 02:19:24,890
[SPEAKER_18]: and it's, you know, I check the mail every day.

1833
02:19:25,551 --> 02:19:27,612
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not meaning last Friday as in two days ago.

1834
02:19:27,672 --> 02:19:28,853
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm meaning the week before.

1835
02:19:30,133 --> 02:19:34,596
[SPEAKER_18]: It does not take seven days to mail a check in town.

1836
02:19:35,076 --> 02:19:36,057
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, maybe two.

1837
02:19:38,158 --> 02:19:39,059
[SPEAKER_18]: But not in Carmichael.

1838
02:19:40,079 --> 02:19:46,623
[SPEAKER_18]: When ARC is six minutes from my house and the post office is six minutes from both ARC and my house.

1839
02:19:47,944 --> 02:19:49,505
[SPEAKER_18]: No, this is just, it's,

1840
02:19:50,356 --> 02:19:54,098
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm going to call them on Tuesday and say, excuse me, bitches.

1841
02:19:55,660 --> 02:20:00,142
[SPEAKER_18]: If my money isn't here within the next two business days... Give me my money!

1842
02:20:00,603 --> 02:20:04,325
[SPEAKER_18]: Your asses are getting reported to the Department of Education and you know what they will do to you.

1843
02:20:04,625 --> 02:20:05,386
[SPEAKER_21]: Bitch better have my money.

1844
02:20:05,406 --> 02:20:06,327
[SPEAKER_18]: They will pull your funding.

1845
02:20:09,329 --> 02:20:09,429
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh.

1846
02:20:12,331 --> 02:20:13,251
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, I vented.

1847
02:20:13,291 --> 02:20:15,112
[SPEAKER_18]: That's like been my rage for the week.

1848
02:20:15,152 --> 02:20:17,314
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you forgot it was a three hour show here for a minute.

1849
02:20:17,354 --> 02:20:17,614
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

1850
02:20:18,334 --> 02:20:18,915
[SPEAKER_18]: I just had a...

1851
02:20:19,349 --> 02:20:21,970
[SPEAKER_18]: Big build-up of rage, and now I feel better.

1852
02:20:22,590 --> 02:20:23,070
[SPEAKER_18]: You feel better?

1853
02:20:23,510 --> 02:20:24,330
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I feel better.

1854
02:20:24,350 --> 02:20:24,870
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1855
02:20:24,890 --> 02:20:26,791
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you have to say?

1856
02:20:27,471 --> 02:20:29,531
[SPEAKER_18]: My foot says, get this thing away from me, bitch.

1857
02:20:29,611 --> 02:20:29,951
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1858
02:20:30,331 --> 02:20:31,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, he found the third mic.

1859
02:20:31,672 --> 02:20:32,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Scary.

1860
02:20:32,052 --> 02:20:32,372
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1861
02:20:32,932 --> 02:20:36,933
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on, let's go to Loki and Loki's FUs of the week.

1862
02:20:43,594 --> 02:20:45,095
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm starting to get a little dizzy.

1863
02:20:45,275 --> 02:20:45,675
[SPEAKER_06]: That's cool.

1864
02:20:47,600 --> 02:20:51,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, first FU goes to my stupid cabinet and the goddamn Ipac 2 for not working.

1865
02:20:51,561 --> 02:21:01,564
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even know why, because it works for like 2 seconds, or like, well, maybe a little longer, 2 seconds, but more like 30 seconds or like half a song in DDR, and then it just stops working for no reason, and I don't know why.

1866
02:21:01,884 --> 02:21:08,226
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was conflicting with the Ipac 4 that I had in there, but no, that's not the case, because I unplugged the other one, and it still breaks.

1867
02:21:08,306 --> 02:21:16,489
[SPEAKER_06]: So apparently, my shitty solder job that I did on it didn't work, so I need to, I don't know, get a new one, I guess.

1868
02:21:17,406 --> 02:21:20,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it's because it shares the name with a crappy Macintosh computer.

1869
02:21:21,327 --> 02:21:23,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot there's a Mac lever in here.

1870
02:21:24,448 --> 02:21:25,609
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to go run and hide now.

1871
02:21:26,149 --> 02:21:29,470
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm coming after you, and I'm going to clock you in with my iPod.

1872
02:21:29,490 --> 02:21:35,852
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck you to the new iMacs, because, well, you can make them look prettier, but they're still going to suck.

1873
02:21:37,672 --> 02:21:39,593
[SPEAKER_06]: I said you can make them look prettier, but they're still going to suck.

1874
02:21:39,613 --> 02:21:40,473
[SPEAKER_16]: Dude, what is this?

1875
02:21:40,573 --> 02:21:42,254
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, crap on the Mac fan base?

1876
02:21:43,228 --> 02:21:47,752
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, it's no fair to you because we happen to have a bunch of IBM freaks here.

1877
02:21:50,037 --> 02:21:50,457
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

1878
02:21:50,537 --> 02:21:52,738
[SPEAKER_05]: If I had $3,000, I'd love to buy an iPad.

1879
02:21:53,578 --> 02:21:56,278
[SPEAKER_06]: What the hell is the i in the iMac and iPod?

1880
02:21:56,579 --> 02:21:57,619
[SPEAKER_06]: What the hell is i mean?

1881
02:21:57,719 --> 02:21:58,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Internet or something.

1882
02:21:58,559 --> 02:21:58,939
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1883
02:22:00,179 --> 02:22:02,700
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how to use computers, so I buy this piece of shit.

1884
02:22:02,980 --> 02:22:03,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Mac.

1885
02:22:04,720 --> 02:22:07,721
[SPEAKER_05]: The opinions expressed on this show by Loki.

1886
02:22:08,281 --> 02:22:15,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, I think Apple computers are for people that don't know how to use computers, but think that pretty computers are good.

1887
02:22:16,090 --> 02:22:22,912
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki is very lucky, he's far across the room from me right now, but he's not far enough to miss being hit in the head by a soda bottle or something.

1888
02:22:24,332 --> 02:22:35,235
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, now, now, now, now, we have... In defense of Apple, I played on an Apple II computer, and I played a lot of kicks on that in Lode Runner, so okay.

1889
02:22:36,957 --> 02:22:39,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Without Apple, we would not have had Oregon Trail.

1890
02:22:39,219 --> 02:22:41,540
[SPEAKER_26]: Represent.

1891
02:22:41,920 --> 02:22:44,302
[SPEAKER_26]: Or the first version of Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego.

1892
02:22:44,662 --> 02:22:46,083
[SPEAKER_26]: Or Odell Lake.

1893
02:22:46,263 --> 02:22:51,106
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I was going to say Odell Lake.

1894
02:22:51,146 --> 02:22:53,648
[SPEAKER_18]: My first computer was a Mac.

1895
02:22:54,728 --> 02:22:58,050
[SPEAKER_18]: And it came in that little box with the 5-inch screen.

1896
02:22:58,931 --> 02:23:01,993
[SPEAKER_18]: And I played a lot of Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego on that thing.

1897
02:23:02,836 --> 02:23:07,400
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, and you know, who needs to upgrade my computer or even work on it?

1898
02:23:07,640 --> 02:23:12,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I can't get to it because goddammit, the monitor and the computer are the same damn thing!

1899
02:23:12,404 --> 02:23:15,787
[SPEAKER_18]: I take that back, my first computer was the Texas Instruments computer.

1900
02:23:16,644 --> 02:23:23,807
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, and I forgot... I spent five hours programming in BASIC to watch a little ball bounce back and forth across the screen and change color.

1901
02:23:23,867 --> 02:23:31,831
[SPEAKER_06]: And I forgot about Mac's contribution to the first-person shooter realm, Marathon, because that game is so much better than Quake and Unreal any day.

1902
02:23:32,511 --> 02:23:35,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, those games weren't even out yet when Marathon came out, man.

1903
02:23:37,835 --> 02:23:38,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.

1904
02:23:38,816 --> 02:23:42,779
[SPEAKER_06]: I can go on for hours about how bad Apple sucks, but I don't think I will.

1905
02:23:43,259 --> 02:23:44,561
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about Microsoft.

1906
02:23:44,861 --> 02:23:50,105
[SPEAKER_06]: Microsoft sucks, too, because Service Pack 2's lame.

1907
02:23:50,225 --> 02:23:52,247
[SPEAKER_06]: At least he's an equal opportunity offender.

1908
02:23:53,940 --> 02:24:00,405
[SPEAKER_06]: They said, yeah, Microsoft Windows is never going to be secure until about, I don't know, 2011, 2015.

1909
02:24:01,246 --> 02:24:02,467
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thank you for warning me.

1910
02:24:02,607 --> 02:24:03,988
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm buying your piece of shit now.

1911
02:24:04,108 --> 02:24:05,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wait, no, I'm not buying your piece of shit now.

1912
02:24:05,949 --> 02:24:07,010
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm downloading it for free.

1913
02:24:09,174 --> 02:24:12,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Even by then, the hackers will have new, you know, things to break.

1914
02:24:12,837 --> 02:24:17,201
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't matter, it's just, you know, their software's gonna suck, no matter what.

1915
02:24:17,221 --> 02:24:19,943
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's all we have, okay, Loki?

1916
02:24:21,424 --> 02:24:22,825
[SPEAKER_06]: It's what you get when you outsource.

1917
02:24:23,786 --> 02:24:27,949
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, those people in India, they're just not as sharp as those people in, you know, America.

1918
02:24:28,049 --> 02:24:29,971
[SPEAKER_06]: No, wait, I'm wrong, they are sharper than them.

1919
02:24:32,552 --> 02:24:45,499
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, um, no, other than that, um, really not anything else I'm mad at other than, um, well, not anyone being at QZAR last night because there, I don't know where the hell people were in Vacaville.

1920
02:24:45,999 --> 02:24:50,001
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no, I'm not talking about you, I'm talking about the Vacaville folk that normally are there.

1921
02:24:50,021 --> 02:24:50,462
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, is that normal?

1922
02:24:50,482 --> 02:24:52,963
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, there's no Skater Cowboy, no anything.

1923
02:24:53,303 --> 02:24:53,583
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

1924
02:24:53,623 --> 02:24:54,384
[SPEAKER_06]: No Skater Cowboy.

1925
02:24:54,504 --> 02:24:56,565
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just, no one there.

1926
02:24:56,705 --> 02:25:00,407
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, oh my god, they left Vacaville.

1927
02:25:01,147 --> 02:25:01,908
[SPEAKER_06]: That's scary.

1928
02:25:02,754 --> 02:25:04,155
[SPEAKER_06]: All the things just keep getting better

1929
02:25:30,982 --> 02:25:32,523
[SPEAKER_04]: No, things just keep getting worse.

1930
02:25:32,603 --> 02:25:41,749
[SPEAKER_04]: No, actually, it's been an okay week, but I would just first like to say, you know what, if I was going to say F you to Apple, that's because I was a Commodore 64 fan back in the day.

1931
02:25:43,310 --> 02:25:46,032
[SPEAKER_04]: But I've been contemplating buying a Mac laptop.

1932
02:25:46,812 --> 02:25:48,193
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to listen to Loki.

1933
02:25:48,433 --> 02:25:49,054
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of want one.

1934
02:25:50,074 --> 02:25:52,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, because laptops are different.

1935
02:25:52,236 --> 02:25:53,257
[SPEAKER_04]: I think laptops are different.

1936
02:25:53,317 --> 02:25:55,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you can't upgrade even a PC laptop very easily.

1937
02:25:56,339 --> 02:25:56,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Not very easily.

1938
02:25:57,475 --> 02:26:00,118
[SPEAKER_04]: You can put up like a memory upgrade, and that's the main thing you can do.

1939
02:26:00,238 --> 02:26:01,099
[SPEAKER_04]: I want one!

1940
02:26:01,219 --> 02:26:01,940
[SPEAKER_20]: I want one!

1941
02:26:02,760 --> 02:26:03,321
[SPEAKER_20]: Where?

1942
02:26:03,341 --> 02:26:14,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, otherwise, uh, an F you, uh, I don't know, an F you to the fact that I'm leaving again in just over a week, and that makes me sad.

1943
02:26:14,913 --> 02:26:19,217
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't want to leave again for two weeks, especially with everything that's kind of going on back home.

1944
02:26:20,323 --> 02:26:21,624
[SPEAKER_05]: You get paid a lot of money.

1945
02:26:21,644 --> 02:26:22,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I could get SARS.

1946
02:26:22,745 --> 02:26:24,427
[SPEAKER_05]: You get paid in money and sex.

1947
02:26:24,527 --> 02:26:28,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, on the other hand, at the same time... Shut up, Nelly.

1948
02:26:28,650 --> 02:26:34,074
[SPEAKER_04]: At the same time, when I do go, the company pays for all my food, so that'll be extra money that I can spend on video games!

1949
02:26:36,016 --> 02:26:37,477
[SPEAKER_06]: No, go ahead and finish the FQs.

1950
02:26:37,517 --> 02:26:39,439
[SPEAKER_06]: I completely forgot about that.

1951
02:26:40,179 --> 02:26:43,162
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I'm done since the rest of you are going to take all the time.

1952
02:26:44,316 --> 02:26:44,576
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

1953
02:26:45,357 --> 02:26:45,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

1954
02:26:46,257 --> 02:26:46,757
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.

1955
02:26:47,137 --> 02:26:48,778
[SPEAKER_06]: This wasn't about FUs of the Week.

1956
02:26:48,818 --> 02:26:52,640
[SPEAKER_06]: This is... I won a trip to San Diego in October.

1957
02:26:53,120 --> 02:26:56,802
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna be staying at the Hotel Del Coronado.

1958
02:26:58,063 --> 02:27:02,125
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is basically a fucking expensive hotel, which is also haunted.

1959
02:27:02,685 --> 02:27:04,886
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um... Take your germanium.

1960
02:27:05,066 --> 02:27:06,066
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, your portal to hell.

1961
02:27:06,287 --> 02:27:08,207
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, your... Shut up!

1962
02:27:09,028 --> 02:27:11,209
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll never get past security on the plane.

1963
02:27:11,329 --> 02:27:12,149
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll think it's a bomb.

1964
02:27:12,249 --> 02:27:13,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe... Oh, never mind.

1965
02:27:13,997 --> 02:27:15,298
[SPEAKER_06]: What is that bomb you have?

1966
02:27:15,558 --> 02:27:16,319
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a bomb.

1967
02:27:16,359 --> 02:27:17,079
[SPEAKER_06]: You said bomb!

1968
02:27:17,099 --> 02:27:17,980
[SPEAKER_06]: You're a terrorist!

1969
02:27:18,781 --> 02:27:19,881
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, that's all I have.

1970
02:27:19,921 --> 02:27:21,883
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, Hotel Del Coronado.

1971
02:27:22,563 --> 02:27:24,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome place in San Diego.

1972
02:27:24,665 --> 02:27:26,246
[SPEAKER_04]: All expenses paid by my work.

1973
02:27:26,786 --> 02:27:27,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

1974
02:27:27,227 --> 02:27:27,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Yummy.

1975
02:27:28,668 --> 02:27:31,009
[SPEAKER_04]: OLR stalker fans, now you know where to find them.

1976
02:27:31,209 --> 02:27:32,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, moving on.

1977
02:27:33,291 --> 02:27:36,493
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to Floatwalk with his FUs of the week.

1978
02:27:37,754 --> 02:27:38,154
[SPEAKER_26]: Lordy.

1979
02:27:38,295 --> 02:27:40,236
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, didn't go keep this actually pretty short.

1980
02:27:40,923 --> 02:27:53,675
[SPEAKER_26]: First FA of the week goes to all the people over in Japan's board to say that the people who are creating steps for Ultramix 2 don't deserve to be doing any of it.

1981
02:27:54,175 --> 02:27:56,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, like you people do over on the board.

1982
02:27:56,918 --> 02:27:57,378
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.

1983
02:27:57,398 --> 02:28:03,884
[SPEAKER_26]: It's funny because one of the biggest arguments is, well, I've never seen any of these guys ranked on the sim file community.

1984
02:28:04,406 --> 02:28:05,887
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm sitting here thinking, what the hell?

1985
02:28:05,907 --> 02:28:07,248
[SPEAKER_03]: That should be a credit!

1986
02:28:07,869 --> 02:28:08,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly!

1987
02:28:08,890 --> 02:28:17,177
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm sitting here thinking, okay, wonderful, 90% of sim files I've seen are like 1,100, you know, finger steps, you know, patterns.

1988
02:28:17,197 --> 02:28:17,557
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

1989
02:28:17,777 --> 02:28:25,644
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, okay, you try putting 200 pounds of pressure on those fingers and doing that, then maybe, just maybe, I'll give you a little bit of credit there.

1990
02:28:26,184 --> 02:28:26,885
[SPEAKER_05]: And like, you know...

1991
02:28:27,617 --> 02:28:38,065
[SPEAKER_05]: Meanwhile, you're doing, you know, having a real life and making money doing your job, where these other people who have no jobs are sitting there doing nothing but making steps and putting them on communities and stuff.

1992
02:28:38,285 --> 02:28:45,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I know there's a lot of probably a few cool, you know, people there online doing these steps, but seriously, he's got a life he needs to take care of first.

1993
02:28:45,390 --> 02:28:56,438
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, I mean, you got all that going on, and I'm sitting here thinking, with all the edits you make in sim files, guess what, you're just making, you're basically playing 2DX there, you know, get with the other game, you know, don't waste your time on...

1994
02:28:56,920 --> 02:29:07,448
[SPEAKER_26]: Arrow Smashing, you know, just saying we don't know what we're talking about, we're underqualified, but I could go off about how good we are and all that.

1995
02:29:07,488 --> 02:29:09,169
[SPEAKER_27]: Have they even played any of the steps yet?

1996
02:29:09,189 --> 02:29:10,770
[SPEAKER_26]: They're like, oh, they suck already!

1997
02:29:11,971 --> 02:29:15,734
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, I mean, once the game drops, I think people are definitely going to be pleasantly surprised.

1998
02:29:15,754 --> 02:29:16,334
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, though?

1999
02:29:16,394 --> 02:29:17,455
[SPEAKER_04]: People are still going to hate it.

2000
02:29:17,475 --> 02:29:19,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Same thing I was telling Sigurd when he was here.

2001
02:29:19,377 --> 02:29:20,277
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, you know what?

2002
02:29:20,317 --> 02:29:22,519
[SPEAKER_04]: No matter what, when the game comes out, people are going to hate the steps.

2003
02:29:23,451 --> 02:29:26,153
[SPEAKER_04]: And oh man, the people around the office were ready to throw down with, uh...

2004
02:29:48,092 --> 02:29:49,653
[SPEAKER_26]: But you know, it's all good.

2005
02:29:49,713 --> 02:29:50,394
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, we're rich.

2006
02:29:50,574 --> 02:29:51,415
[SPEAKER_26]: Thanks.

2007
02:29:51,615 --> 02:29:52,896
[SPEAKER_26]: Scoreboard.

2008
02:29:52,956 --> 02:29:53,856
[SPEAKER_26]: Look at the scoreboard.

2009
02:29:54,036 --> 02:29:55,818
[SPEAKER_26]: Our scoreboard says we got paychecks.

2010
02:29:57,059 --> 02:30:01,121
[SPEAKER_26]: And last FB of the week just goes to work.

2011
02:30:01,302 --> 02:30:04,344
[SPEAKER_26]: I know, yeah, you guys are thinking, why should I bitch about working at Konami?

2012
02:30:04,504 --> 02:30:04,884
[SPEAKER_26]: Guess what?

2013
02:30:04,944 --> 02:30:06,445
[SPEAKER_26]: I have to work tomorrow for Labor Day.

2014
02:30:07,906 --> 02:30:09,588
[SPEAKER_26]: And not on a fun game at that.

2015
02:30:09,768 --> 02:30:13,050
[SPEAKER_26]: But that said, you know, that just ain't right.

2016
02:30:13,350 --> 02:30:15,132
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, I got people who want to spend time with me.

2017
02:30:15,172 --> 02:30:17,033
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, I got a lady who needs some lovin' in.

2018
02:30:17,489 --> 02:30:18,110
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, what happens?

2019
02:30:18,230 --> 02:30:19,511
[SPEAKER_26]: I gotta leave her in the morning, man.

2020
02:30:19,811 --> 02:30:22,954
[SPEAKER_26]: Like, you know, I'm just the, you know, John that picked her up and, you know, dumped her off, man.

2021
02:30:22,994 --> 02:30:24,295
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, what's up with that?

2022
02:30:26,437 --> 02:30:26,958
[SPEAKER_11]: Huh.

2023
02:30:27,938 --> 02:30:30,321
[SPEAKER_26]: But, you know, it ain't really like that.

2024
02:30:30,361 --> 02:30:32,422
[SPEAKER_26]: What's the point of having to work in the morning?

2025
02:30:32,903 --> 02:30:33,223
[SPEAKER_26]: Sucks.

2026
02:30:33,563 --> 02:30:34,905
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, yeah, and one last F you.

2027
02:30:35,185 --> 02:30:37,007
[SPEAKER_26]: Goes to Order of Chaos, actually.

2028
02:30:37,327 --> 02:30:39,149
[SPEAKER_26]: Sure, you know, people say you shouldn't crack on your own.

2029
02:30:39,169 --> 02:30:39,769
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, guess what?

2030
02:30:40,169 --> 02:30:42,952
[SPEAKER_26]: Ever since he posted that rubbernecking post of all the car accidents...

2031
02:30:43,405 --> 02:30:48,249
[SPEAKER_26]: Every day I've commuted to work, I've had to be stopped because of, like, traffic accidents happening.

2032
02:30:48,669 --> 02:30:53,533
[SPEAKER_26]: So he's made my commute, like, half an hour worse every single day ever since he posted that two weeks ago.

2033
02:30:53,633 --> 02:30:55,655
[SPEAKER_26]: Thanks a whole hell of a lot for nothing.

2034
02:30:55,875 --> 02:30:56,956
[SPEAKER_26]: You get no Oreos.

2035
02:30:57,236 --> 02:30:57,536
[SPEAKER_26]: Bye.

2036
02:30:58,677 --> 02:30:58,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

2037
02:30:59,658 --> 02:31:00,639
[SPEAKER_26]: I love you anyway.

2038
02:31:01,639 --> 02:31:06,263
[SPEAKER_04]: So, special lady, Shark Skrull, do you have any FUs you'd like to give us tonight?

2039
02:31:06,903 --> 02:31:08,605
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I kind of did, and then...

2040
02:31:09,150 --> 02:31:12,311
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm just in pain and kind of mellow now, so this F.U.

2041
02:31:12,351 --> 02:31:13,792
[SPEAKER_16]: space for rent, highest bidder.

2042
02:31:13,812 --> 02:31:16,673
[SPEAKER_16]: I bid a penny.

2043
02:31:17,674 --> 02:31:18,794
[SPEAKER_16]: Give me a dollar, bitch.

2044
02:31:21,775 --> 02:31:23,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Angel, your F.U.s of the week.

2045
02:31:24,356 --> 02:31:25,577
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, F.U.

2046
02:31:25,657 --> 02:31:38,082
[SPEAKER_19]: to SBC for basically giving us the lowdown of having, or we have to pay $150 to get a phone jack in the den to have DSL.

2047
02:31:39,254 --> 02:31:39,855
[SPEAKER_19]: And you know what?

2048
02:31:40,035 --> 02:31:41,435
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't think I want to play that.

2049
02:31:41,575 --> 02:32:01,125
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to shop around a bit, see if... Well, yeah, we can do Cable too, but... We want... This is true, but... I want to... Other people in the house want to exhaust all options first before... Subjecting to Cable, so we'll see what happens.

2050
02:32:01,145 --> 02:32:04,767
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Cable in Sacramento is just better than all the DSL in Sacramento, so... Probably.

2051
02:32:05,007 --> 02:32:06,588
[SPEAKER_05]: You might want to research that.

2052
02:32:08,450 --> 02:32:11,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's Loki at the internet.

2053
02:32:12,173 --> 02:32:12,814
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm Al Gore.

2054
02:32:12,894 --> 02:32:15,436
[SPEAKER_19]: I created the internet.

2055
02:32:17,117 --> 02:32:20,400
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, and I don't know.

2056
02:32:22,622 --> 02:32:23,323
[SPEAKER_19]: I guess that's it.

2057
02:32:23,643 --> 02:32:25,304
[SPEAKER_19]: Because I can't think of anything at the moment.

2058
02:32:26,125 --> 02:32:28,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's go on to Explicit.

2059
02:32:28,787 --> 02:32:29,308
[SPEAKER_19]: You're FU's.

2060
02:32:36,004 --> 02:32:37,225
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, okay.

2061
02:32:37,586 --> 02:32:39,828
[SPEAKER_27]: I wanna give an F to Texas Hold'em.

2062
02:32:40,869 --> 02:32:41,790
[SPEAKER_27]: God damn it.

2063
02:32:42,510 --> 02:32:46,895
[SPEAKER_27]: I need some cards that goes at least an 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King at least.

2064
02:32:47,255 --> 02:32:49,077
[SPEAKER_27]: All I'm getting is nothing but 2s and 3s.

2065
02:32:50,198 --> 02:32:53,901
[SPEAKER_27]: How the hell can you win an actual Texas Hold'em game with just those cards?

2066
02:32:54,142 --> 02:32:54,842
[SPEAKER_26]: Someone's cheating.

2067
02:32:55,403 --> 02:32:57,525
[SPEAKER_26]: Play 2-7 offsuit, best hand in the game.

2068
02:32:59,594 --> 02:33:07,701
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, but, fuck, I'm not wasting no fucking 40 bucks, and another F you goes to my family for forcing me to play the damn game.

2069
02:33:08,962 --> 02:33:11,344
[SPEAKER_27]: God damn it, I told you I'm not wasting more money.

2070
02:33:12,124 --> 02:33:15,487
[SPEAKER_27]: I only play games that I know I'm gonna win money on, like Blackjack.

2071
02:33:17,028 --> 02:33:19,310
[SPEAKER_27]: I get 200 on cash for kicking that.

2072
02:33:20,471 --> 02:33:22,593
[SPEAKER_27]: Told them, ah, no wins whatsoever.

2073
02:33:23,734 --> 02:33:28,978
[SPEAKER_27]: Or should I just say fuck you to the cards and sell for giving me the bad luck?

2074
02:33:30,931 --> 02:33:31,251
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay.

2075
02:33:31,932 --> 02:33:35,815
[SPEAKER_27]: And fuck you to some lady throwing a damn beer bottle in my head.

2076
02:33:37,657 --> 02:33:37,917
[SPEAKER_27]: What?

2077
02:33:39,158 --> 02:33:41,080
[SPEAKER_27]: I just mentioned this before.

2078
02:33:42,661 --> 02:33:44,622
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just her way of saying I love you.

2079
02:33:45,283 --> 02:33:45,924
[SPEAKER_06]: No!

2080
02:33:46,324 --> 02:33:47,365
[SPEAKER_27]: No, no, no, no.

2081
02:33:48,145 --> 02:33:49,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, she wants to share a drink.

2082
02:33:49,266 --> 02:33:51,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing says I love you like a beer in my face.

2083
02:33:51,048 --> 02:33:51,288
[SPEAKER_04]: A drink?

2084
02:33:51,308 --> 02:33:52,429
[SPEAKER_27]: Kill me with a drink.

2085
02:33:53,490 --> 02:33:54,771
[SPEAKER_27]: I got hit in the head right here.

2086
02:33:55,872 --> 02:33:56,993
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, dude.

2087
02:33:57,773 --> 02:33:58,974
[SPEAKER_27]: Got hit in the top of my head.

2088
02:33:59,074 --> 02:33:59,495
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn it.

2089
02:34:02,796 --> 02:34:05,038
[SPEAKER_05]: You should have been like, oh, you want a drink, huh, bitch?

2090
02:34:05,238 --> 02:34:06,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Beer tastes good.

2091
02:34:06,199 --> 02:34:08,421
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just waving like this.

2092
02:34:08,941 --> 02:34:12,044
[SPEAKER_27]: You didn't have to throw a damn beer bottle at me.

2093
02:34:12,084 --> 02:34:14,686
[SPEAKER_26]: Perhaps you were thinking tastes great and she really meant less filling.

2094
02:34:16,188 --> 02:34:16,348
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh.

2095
02:34:17,349 --> 02:34:18,470
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, dear.

2096
02:34:18,530 --> 02:34:21,772
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, anything else?

2097
02:34:22,833 --> 02:34:26,477
[SPEAKER_27]: F you for some kids kissing on my Toyota Corolla S tire.

2098
02:34:27,037 --> 02:34:27,337
[SPEAKER_27]: What?

2099
02:34:28,078 --> 02:34:28,438
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes.

2100
02:34:29,699 --> 02:34:30,320
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude.

2101
02:34:32,140 --> 02:34:33,121
[SPEAKER_11]: Holy crap!

2102
02:34:33,221 --> 02:34:35,302
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, waving is the first step to rape.

2103
02:34:37,924 --> 02:34:39,726
[SPEAKER_06]: She was only defending herself.

2104
02:34:41,507 --> 02:34:49,553
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a reason why there's porta... There's a fucking reason why there's porta potties in bathrooms.

2105
02:34:51,675 --> 02:34:54,316
[SPEAKER_27]: You can't piss on tires, they don't clean the tires.

2106
02:34:58,431 --> 02:35:05,737
[SPEAKER_27]: F you to the security up at the Rage for breaking up a battle and stuff and for breaking up people freak dancing in there.

2107
02:35:05,857 --> 02:35:06,777
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh goody, that's what I'm going tonight.

2108
02:35:06,797 --> 02:35:12,682
[SPEAKER_27]: Just because I have a nice boner by accident after some girl's freaking on me does not fucking be how raping her.

2109
02:35:13,162 --> 02:35:15,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember that part about TMI being in the show?

2110
02:35:15,624 --> 02:35:16,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember that part?

2111
02:35:16,945 --> 02:35:19,327
[SPEAKER_27]: Raping is a crime, but freak dancing is not.

2112
02:35:22,095 --> 02:35:22,616
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, man.

2113
02:35:22,636 --> 02:35:23,237
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, anything else?

2114
02:35:23,918 --> 02:35:25,381
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's just say, do be continued.

2115
02:35:25,702 --> 02:35:26,102
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright.

2116
02:35:26,563 --> 02:35:26,804
[SPEAKER_27]: As usual.

2117
02:35:26,824 --> 02:35:27,385
[SPEAKER_27]: Who else?

2118
02:35:27,405 --> 02:35:28,226
[SPEAKER_27]: That's too much.

2119
02:35:28,427 --> 02:35:30,751
[SPEAKER_27]: LankyStyle.

2120
02:35:31,192 --> 02:35:33,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you really want to go there?

2121
02:35:34,886 --> 02:35:36,127
[SPEAKER_04]: You say what you want, buddy.

2122
02:35:36,187 --> 02:35:36,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Say whatever you want.

2123
02:35:36,888 --> 02:35:37,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

2124
02:35:38,169 --> 02:35:49,798
[SPEAKER_05]: All I have to say is big F you to people who want to fucking... Miserable people who have made their lives fucking horrible on their own and want to fucking bring everybody else down because they're fucking immature little fucking pricks.

2125
02:35:50,158 --> 02:35:51,759
[SPEAKER_05]: You go ahead and do it without us.

2126
02:35:52,360 --> 02:35:56,543
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead, drive your fucking car off the road and kill yourself because no one's going to fucking miss you.

2127
02:35:57,165 --> 02:35:59,746
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't bring us down because you're shit.

2128
02:35:59,806 --> 02:36:05,547
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't need to really go into detail, it's kind of a personal thing, but it's been a fucking rocky weekend.

2129
02:36:05,767 --> 02:36:11,249
[SPEAKER_06]: And they have to understand, to open a door, it does not require your fist going through the door, but there's a handle there.

2130
02:36:12,489 --> 02:36:17,271
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, goddammit, Diet Dr. Pepper does taste like regular Dr. Pepper.

2131
02:36:18,091 --> 02:36:20,792
[SPEAKER_07]: No sacrifices here, Ren.

2132
02:36:24,343 --> 02:36:27,645
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we have a segment or a little subject for a Wednesday show, right?

2133
02:36:27,825 --> 02:36:28,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

2134
02:36:29,527 --> 02:36:31,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Gypsy Wolf, do you have any FUs?

2135
02:36:31,488 --> 02:36:32,008
[SPEAKER_07]: It's brilliant.

2136
02:36:32,249 --> 02:36:34,670
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, FU to Sacramento for not having any decent clubs.

2137
02:36:35,351 --> 02:36:36,251
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't found one yet.

2138
02:36:36,412 --> 02:36:37,633
[SPEAKER_07]: I still have yet to find one.

2139
02:36:37,793 --> 02:36:38,553
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been to a couple.

2140
02:36:38,653 --> 02:36:40,495
[SPEAKER_07]: Most of them are either really ghetto or really teeny-bopper.

2141
02:36:40,515 --> 02:36:41,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you been to Pace's?

2142
02:36:42,296 --> 02:36:42,476
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

2143
02:36:43,237 --> 02:36:45,638
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can put up with the gaiety, it's a lot of fun.

2144
02:36:46,319 --> 02:36:47,420
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's sexy men there.

2145
02:36:47,440 --> 02:36:48,260
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll take you there sometime.

2146
02:36:52,503 --> 02:36:53,283
[SPEAKER_07]: I have not been that far.

2147
02:36:53,443 --> 02:36:53,944
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't had time.

2148
02:36:55,024 --> 02:36:55,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else?

2149
02:36:55,344 --> 02:36:56,805
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, no, nothing else.

2150
02:36:57,585 --> 02:36:57,885
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2151
02:36:59,046 --> 02:37:01,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go on to our chat room if you then, unless Nelly had something.

2152
02:37:03,007 --> 02:37:03,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's Rice Princess?

2153
02:37:03,767 --> 02:37:05,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Is she off playing Harvest Moon still?

2154
02:37:05,488 --> 02:37:05,928
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

2155
02:37:06,328 --> 02:37:06,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2156
02:37:06,588 --> 02:37:07,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's not go there.

2157
02:37:07,769 --> 02:37:08,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2158
02:37:08,709 --> 02:37:09,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on.

2159
02:37:09,309 --> 02:37:13,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see what's going on with the chat room.

2160
02:37:14,874 --> 02:37:19,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark Knight says, My super FU is to work as always and financial setbacks.

2161
02:37:19,456 --> 02:37:21,797
[SPEAKER_04]: And for the record, I have to work on Labor Day as well.

2162
02:37:22,417 --> 02:37:25,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Sigurd says, My first FU goes to Sweet Coden IV.

2163
02:37:25,538 --> 02:37:27,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Blasphemous for me to say it, I know.

2164
02:37:27,539 --> 02:37:29,360
[SPEAKER_04]: The FU is for the game being too short.

2165
02:37:29,440 --> 02:37:32,621
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm almost done over 90 stars and only at 22 hours.

2166
02:37:33,021 --> 02:37:37,383
[SPEAKER_04]: An FU to parties not wanting my sexy level 12 thief in Final Fantasy XI to join them.

2167
02:37:40,664 --> 02:37:41,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Karma Titan says,

2168
02:37:42,694 --> 02:37:43,735
[SPEAKER_04]: He wants to get political.

2169
02:37:43,775 --> 02:37:45,095
[SPEAKER_04]: He says, F you, George Bush.

2170
02:37:45,195 --> 02:37:45,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Bush lied.

2171
02:37:45,816 --> 02:37:46,456
[SPEAKER_04]: People died.

2172
02:37:47,056 --> 02:37:50,658
[SPEAKER_04]: F you, I lived through 110 plus all freaking day and it ain't that bad.

2173
02:37:51,198 --> 02:37:53,139
[SPEAKER_04]: F you, all your base are belongs to us.

2174
02:37:55,701 --> 02:37:56,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, boy.

2175
02:37:58,562 --> 02:38:02,865
[SPEAKER_04]: VXJasonXV says, I would like to submit one on behalf of my right-hand.

2176
02:38:03,045 --> 02:38:08,908
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to Adelphia for breaking cable two days ago and not planning on doing anything about it until Wednesday.

2177
02:38:09,008 --> 02:38:09,428
[SPEAKER_04]: That is all.

2178
02:38:11,070 --> 02:38:13,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Ninst says, F you to my job and the people I work with.

2179
02:38:13,871 --> 02:38:16,673
[SPEAKER_04]: The job is getting to be bullshit and the people are getting more stupid.

2180
02:38:17,173 --> 02:38:22,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Ninst also says, F you to my computer, I had to format earlier, and of course, there were problems during the format.

2181
02:38:23,296 --> 02:38:28,338
[SPEAKER_04]: DDR Nemesis says, F you to Floatwalk and Dancer X for giving clues that are too fucking hard.

2182
02:38:29,979 --> 02:38:32,940
[SPEAKER_15]: It would be really easy clues if you had paid attention in school.

2183
02:38:32,960 --> 02:38:36,602
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know, the more you scream, the harder it gets.

2184
02:38:36,942 --> 02:38:37,643
[SPEAKER_26]: Ooh, there you go.

2185
02:38:41,011 --> 02:38:43,111
[SPEAKER_16]: Wait a second, isn't that what you told me last night?

2186
02:38:43,312 --> 02:38:48,793
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just gonna... Damn it, you stole... I was just gonna say it's like sex.

2187
02:38:48,853 --> 02:38:50,473
[SPEAKER_03]: The more you relax, the easier it'll get.

2188
02:38:50,593 --> 02:38:53,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

2189
02:38:54,554 --> 02:38:59,615
[SPEAKER_04]: BlackDevilRx says, You know Loki is really a good guy, so F you to the guy who threw a beer bottle at him.

2190
02:38:59,695 --> 02:39:01,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Except that was explicit.

2191
02:39:01,455 --> 02:39:01,955
[SPEAKER_04]: The beer bottle.

2192
02:39:04,476 --> 02:39:07,917
[SPEAKER_04]: And he says... He also says F you to Service Pack 2.

2193
02:39:10,313 --> 02:39:17,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Misty says, F you to the little kids that like to scream their lungs off when I'm at work, the arcade, and already have a headache.

2194
02:39:18,941 --> 02:39:24,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Shade23 says, F you to California for having such better arcades than us on the East Coast, bastards.

2195
02:39:24,505 --> 02:39:26,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, come to Sacramento sometime.

2196
02:39:26,047 --> 02:39:26,867
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll feel right at home.

2197
02:39:27,488 --> 02:39:29,530
[SPEAKER_04]: If by better you mean broken, then yes.

2198
02:39:32,032 --> 02:39:32,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Luke.

2199
02:39:33,985 --> 02:39:42,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Lunarius says, F you to DJ Potato for all of his music, especially for killing 511 with his remix 344, and also F you to Hurricane Francis.

2200
02:39:43,092 --> 02:39:48,036
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to Wicco for not sending me my white poppin' buttons and delaying me building my poppin' ASC.

2201
02:39:48,397 --> 02:39:50,478
[SPEAKER_04]: I happen to like DJ Potato, he's a cool guy.

2202
02:39:51,639 --> 02:39:51,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Meanie.

2203
02:39:52,360 --> 02:39:56,063
[SPEAKER_27]: F you to BlackDevilRx for not caring about me, dammit!

2204
02:39:56,643 --> 02:39:59,685
[SPEAKER_04]: SilentBen says, F you to Sakura for singling me out.

2205
02:40:00,006 --> 02:40:01,447
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he meant DarkSakura.

2206
02:40:02,848 --> 02:40:04,689
[SPEAKER_04]: She's different than the song in DDR.

2207
02:40:05,410 --> 02:40:06,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Please don't boot me.

2208
02:40:08,213 --> 02:40:10,595
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, you need to realize something about me.

2209
02:40:11,536 --> 02:40:13,738
[SPEAKER_18]: I only single people out out of love.

2210
02:40:14,458 --> 02:40:14,939
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

2211
02:40:15,640 --> 02:40:17,742
[SPEAKER_04]: She's singling you out for a hug.

2212
02:40:19,003 --> 02:40:19,984
[SPEAKER_10]: Aw, hugs!

2213
02:40:22,030 --> 02:40:50,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Legend of Zaku says F you to the fact that summer is over F you to having to spend 3 hours shopping for a new backpack today F you to Sam Goody for selling $18.99 CDs for songs that have been out almost over 9 years F you to having nothing to do this Labor Day weekend and F you to myself for having to exchange a belt I bought at Hot Topic today for a larger size thinking that the first one was going to fit me F you to Microsoft for shitting on XP users with piss poor fixes such as Service Pack 2

2214
02:40:53,567 --> 02:40:56,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Pixie Dust says, my FU goes to carpal tunnel syndrome.

2215
02:40:56,228 --> 02:41:02,512
[SPEAKER_04]: The hospital doctor that saw me was such a cunt and happened to tell me that he hates Bel Air so much, so fuck him.

2216
02:41:02,892 --> 02:41:04,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Typing one hand sucks monkey balls.

2217
02:41:04,653 --> 02:41:07,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than that, FU goes to pain, FU goes to boredom.

2218
02:41:08,435 --> 02:41:14,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Same says, FU to GameStop for looking at me like I was a dumbass for asking for the US Extreme VRare.

2219
02:41:14,658 --> 02:41:16,980
[SPEAKER_04]: And FU to Floatwalk for dissing my edit site.

2220
02:41:19,081 --> 02:41:21,282
[SPEAKER_04]: I dissed it some more, but I didn't see a damn thing on there.

2221
02:41:22,481 --> 02:41:26,843
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkKnight says, OhSky, a bonus FU to the major reign we had in Virginia recently.

2222
02:41:26,923 --> 02:41:28,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Almost made Richmond look like the new Atlantis.

2223
02:41:28,804 --> 02:41:29,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally underwater.

2224
02:41:30,064 --> 02:41:33,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Flaronay says, FU to Scandia for still not fixing the DDR pad.

2225
02:41:34,526 --> 02:41:37,127
[SPEAKER_04]: KarmaTitan says, FU to Altoids Tangerine.

2226
02:41:37,207 --> 02:41:38,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Sours are sour.

2227
02:41:40,149 --> 02:41:41,849
[SPEAKER_04]: And Misty has the last word.

2228
02:41:42,370 --> 02:41:45,791
[SPEAKER_04]: FU to the Arcade for bringing the EX to three songs for credit.

2229
02:41:46,071 --> 02:41:46,631
[SPEAKER_04]: It was four.

2230
02:41:46,731 --> 02:41:47,872
[SPEAKER_04]: And taking off the unlocks.

2231
02:41:50,515 --> 02:41:51,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'll give John Fields one.

2232
02:41:51,876 --> 02:41:54,257
[SPEAKER_04]: FU to construction on highways that should have been finished years ago.

2233
02:41:54,557 --> 02:41:55,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that's it.

2234
02:41:55,257 --> 02:41:55,837
[SPEAKER_04]: No more FUs.

2235
02:41:55,897 --> 02:41:56,617
[SPEAKER_04]: We're done with the segment.

2236
02:41:56,678 --> 02:41:57,018
[SPEAKER_04]: It's done.

2237
02:41:57,098 --> 02:41:57,458
[SPEAKER_04]: It's over.

2238
02:41:57,938 --> 02:41:58,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Complete.

2239
02:41:58,418 --> 02:41:58,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Finished.

2240
02:42:00,039 --> 02:42:00,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2241
02:42:01,660 --> 02:42:03,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God, that was a long FU segment tonight.

2242
02:42:04,080 --> 02:42:04,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Shit.

2243
02:42:07,642 --> 02:42:10,923
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we need to talk about some, like, actual Bimani news at this point.

2244
02:42:11,383 --> 02:42:13,744
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there anything else we could... You mean there's Bimani news?

2245
02:42:13,844 --> 02:42:15,145
[SPEAKER_18]: What's that Bimani crap?

2246
02:42:17,503 --> 02:42:20,424
[SPEAKER_18]: I forgot what that was, because we haven't talked about it in a long time.

2247
02:42:23,805 --> 02:42:33,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's not really Bomani news, but it's Dance Mania news, and as we all know, the Japanese folks always get a lot of their songs from the Dance Mania CDs.

2248
02:42:34,027 --> 02:42:40,789
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a CD called Trans Paradise that was recently released in Japan for 1,995 yen.

2249
02:42:41,109 --> 02:42:41,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Trans Paradise.

2250
02:42:42,089 --> 02:42:45,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Tracklist isn't here yet, but we'll post it to our website soon.

2251
02:42:46,335 --> 02:42:58,922
[SPEAKER_04]: and in not really related to Bomani per se, but those of you guys that play a lot of video games, if you were listening to Wednesday's show, you heard about Acclaim, the video game publisher for such games as Turok.

2252
02:42:59,162 --> 02:43:00,263
[SPEAKER_04]: They went bankrupt.

2253
02:43:00,443 --> 02:43:00,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye-bye.

2254
02:43:00,643 --> 02:43:01,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Acclaim is gone.

2255
02:43:04,105 --> 02:43:08,127
[SPEAKER_18]: I remember back in the days when Acclaim was cool, back in the days when we had NBA Jam.

2256
02:43:10,008 --> 02:43:13,350
[SPEAKER_18]: I say a moment of silence for Acclaim.

2257
02:43:22,143 --> 02:43:22,603
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

2258
02:43:22,923 --> 02:43:23,343
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

2259
02:43:23,403 --> 02:43:25,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you say a moment of silence for acclaim?

2260
02:43:26,865 --> 02:43:29,645
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I have a problem with the volume of my voice.

2261
02:43:29,785 --> 02:43:32,346
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I can't do that because I'd be too obvious.

2262
02:43:33,587 --> 02:43:34,807
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the NBA Jam.

2263
02:43:34,847 --> 02:43:35,707
[SPEAKER_06]: It was awesome.

2264
02:43:36,828 --> 02:43:39,709
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I would always kick ass on it.

2265
02:43:40,289 --> 02:43:40,789
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um...

2266
02:43:41,977 --> 02:43:42,978
[SPEAKER_06]: It was really cool.

2267
02:43:44,259 --> 02:43:48,923
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish that game was still around, though, because I think they got rid of it, but whatever.

2268
02:43:49,843 --> 02:43:50,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2269
02:43:50,764 --> 02:43:56,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, let's give the folks in the chat room another chance to guess at that news.

2270
02:43:56,088 --> 02:43:56,949
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope someone gets it.

2271
02:43:56,969 --> 02:43:57,910
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to play this song.

2272
02:43:58,010 --> 02:44:00,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't let Dancer X have another victory, you guys.

2273
02:44:00,992 --> 02:44:01,613
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to get it.

2274
02:44:02,654 --> 02:44:03,314
[SPEAKER_26]: I will say this.

2275
02:44:03,494 --> 02:44:09,459
[SPEAKER_26]: As I was scrolling back through the text of everyone in the chat room, someone...

2276
02:44:09,935 --> 02:44:10,696
[SPEAKER_26]: DarkSakura.com

2277
02:44:30,831 --> 02:44:33,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki has a song he would like to play for all you guys.

2278
02:44:34,193 --> 02:44:41,757
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have to yell at everyone a little bit because we've been trying to get you guys to participate by naming this remix in our forums.

2279
02:44:41,777 --> 02:44:42,758
[SPEAKER_04]: To hell with you people.

2280
02:44:42,778 --> 02:44:48,341
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've gotten maybe like two guesses or two suggestions that weren't that great.

2281
02:44:48,361 --> 02:44:48,961
[SPEAKER_04]: And they suck.

2282
02:44:50,069 --> 02:44:54,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of you guys said, though, you were like, we need to hear it one more time before we can give it a name.

2283
02:44:54,470 --> 02:44:55,050
[SPEAKER_04]: So, fine.

2284
02:44:55,390 --> 02:44:55,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Here you go.

2285
02:44:56,270 --> 02:44:58,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Your last chance to hear this mix and give it a name.

2286
02:44:58,911 --> 02:44:59,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Fair enough?

2287
02:45:00,071 --> 02:45:00,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, yeah.

2288
02:45:00,771 --> 02:45:01,091
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2289
02:45:01,111 --> 02:45:02,732
[SPEAKER_06]: I already have a name if you don't pick one.

2290
02:45:02,852 --> 02:45:03,152
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2291
02:45:03,212 --> 02:45:07,513
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Loki with a remix of Radical Faith, as yet unnamed.

2292
02:45:07,873 --> 02:45:10,613
[SPEAKER_04]: So, go to our forums, www.orangetownsradio.com.

2293
02:45:10,673 --> 02:45:14,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Look for the thread in Bimani Discussion and guess and give it a title.

2294
02:45:15,234 --> 02:45:15,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever you want.

2295
02:45:16,014 --> 02:45:19,615
[SPEAKER_04]: And Sigurd Rocks, as cute as that was, is not a good remix title.

2296
02:45:21,206 --> 02:45:23,068
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be for, like, an Echo Image remix or something.

2297
02:45:23,188 --> 02:45:23,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2298
02:45:24,649 --> 02:45:25,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, here it is.

2299
02:45:25,590 --> 02:45:28,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else you want to say about this remix of Radical Faith, Loki, that you did?

2300
02:45:28,632 --> 02:45:28,933
[SPEAKER_04]: Brand new?

2301
02:45:29,073 --> 02:45:29,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Nah, not really.

2302
02:45:30,434 --> 02:45:30,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2303
02:45:31,335 --> 02:45:35,598
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, we're open for guesses, and I've gotten one guess so far from Sigurd.

2304
02:45:36,279 --> 02:45:38,201
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's guessing, is it Love Love Shine?

2305
02:45:39,962 --> 02:45:42,124
[SPEAKER_04]: And no, this song is not Love Love Shine.

2306
02:45:42,164 --> 02:45:43,085
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can't guess, you dumbass!

2307
02:45:43,125 --> 02:45:46,848
[SPEAKER_04]: You should have guessed the same thing you guessed the first two times, because you were right the first two times.

2308
02:45:49,028 --> 02:45:51,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, here it is, Loki's brand new remix of Radical Faith.

2309
02:45:51,130 --> 02:45:52,492
[SPEAKER_06]: I want some... no.

2310
02:45:52,832 --> 02:45:53,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Name this.

2311
02:45:54,154 --> 02:45:56,416
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just going to shut up now because I'll just give it away.

2312
02:45:56,456 --> 02:45:58,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, www.orange.radio.com, forums, name it.

2313
02:47:28,086 --> 02:47:28,587
Thanks for watching!

2314
02:48:53,325 --> 02:48:56,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Very sexy from Loki, Radical Faith.

2315
02:48:56,567 --> 02:48:57,427
[SPEAKER_04]: An unnamed remix.

2316
02:48:57,447 --> 02:49:01,549
[SPEAKER_04]: And I gave you guys the URL to post to on our forum.

2317
02:49:02,510 --> 02:49:02,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry.

2318
02:49:03,030 --> 02:49:03,711
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a little loud.

2319
02:49:04,091 --> 02:49:04,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

2320
02:49:04,651 --> 02:49:05,492
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, quit yelling.

2321
02:49:05,512 --> 02:49:07,813
[SPEAKER_18]: Jamie still has a raging headache right now.

2322
02:49:09,654 --> 02:49:09,934
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2323
02:49:11,417 --> 02:49:12,958
[SPEAKER_05]: and Explicit as a raging boner.

2324
02:49:15,479 --> 02:49:16,200
[SPEAKER_18]: And you noticed.

2325
02:49:17,160 --> 02:49:20,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, no, he was saying earlier in a story that freak dancing is not illegal.

2326
02:49:21,003 --> 02:49:22,043
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like... Raging boner.

2327
02:49:22,143 --> 02:49:24,925
[SPEAKER_18]: It's like, I don't know, remember realultimatepower.net?

2328
02:49:25,605 --> 02:49:26,586
[SPEAKER_05]: No, sorry.

2329
02:49:26,706 --> 02:49:27,867
[SPEAKER_18]: This script is awesome.

2330
02:49:30,728 --> 02:49:34,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, as a reminder, please don't send me your guesses or your suggestions.

2331
02:49:34,471 --> 02:49:37,973
[SPEAKER_04]: I should say, over private message, you want to go to the forums and post those.

2332
02:49:38,293 --> 02:49:39,934
[SPEAKER_04]: That link I posted in the chat room that says...

2333
02:49:40,782 --> 02:49:44,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't talk condescendingly to your listeners Don't patronize them Way to go, Loki!

2334
02:49:44,985 --> 02:49:45,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Way to go, Loki!

2335
02:49:45,305 --> 02:49:45,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Scare off our listeners, Loki!

2336
02:49:45,945 --> 02:49:46,666
[SPEAKER_05]: Way to go, Loki!

2337
02:49:46,726 --> 02:49:47,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Scare off our listeners!

2338
02:49:48,847 --> 02:49:50,908
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, cry over it Yeah, that's right, Loki, your music sucks

2339
02:50:11,653 --> 02:50:12,274
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what?

2340
02:50:12,294 --> 02:50:13,375
[SPEAKER_18]: This vacuum sucks.

2341
02:50:26,832 --> 02:50:29,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you going to do maple syrup shots over there, Loki?

2342
02:50:29,513 --> 02:50:31,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Syrup?

2343
02:50:32,074 --> 02:50:36,776
[SPEAKER_04]: He has a thing of Mrs. Butterworth going, Rob, as if I find Mrs. Butterworth hot or something.

2344
02:50:38,396 --> 02:50:41,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Monday night, Diversion, Bomani Remixes, 7 o'clock, tune in, love it.

2345
02:50:42,798 --> 02:50:44,578
[SPEAKER_04]: What's happening on Tuesday night, Jamie?

2346
02:50:45,098 --> 02:50:47,039
[SPEAKER_18]: You need to be mixing some Malibu with that shit.

2347
02:50:47,079 --> 02:50:48,139
[SPEAKER_18]: That happens on Tuesday night?

2348
02:50:48,620 --> 02:50:48,840
[SPEAKER_18]: No.

2349
02:50:50,220 --> 02:50:52,241
[SPEAKER_18]: Tuesday night, pump up the volume.

2350
02:50:53,201 --> 02:50:54,982
[SPEAKER_18]: Starring me, the awesome and...

2351
02:50:55,629 --> 02:51:01,313
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I went to GameCrazy, and the guy there gave me my official nickname.

2352
02:51:01,573 --> 02:51:04,555
[SPEAKER_18]: He was asking me what my name was, because they were putting in something for some order.

2353
02:51:05,195 --> 02:51:08,797
[SPEAKER_18]: And I was like, my name is Jamie the Great and Terrible.

2354
02:51:08,977 --> 02:51:13,280
[SPEAKER_18]: And he was like, how about Jamie the Truly Awesome and Never Nice?

2355
02:51:13,560 --> 02:51:14,761
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's my new official title.

2356
02:51:15,081 --> 02:51:15,822
[SPEAKER_05]: And Never Nice.

2357
02:51:16,062 --> 02:51:16,702
[SPEAKER_18]: And Never Nice.

2358
02:51:16,862 --> 02:51:20,044
[SPEAKER_18]: I am officially Completely Awesome and Never Nice.

2359
02:51:21,125 --> 02:51:22,846
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, my show...

2360
02:51:23,832 --> 02:51:25,914
[SPEAKER_18]: is on Tuesday, and it's called Pump Up the Volume.

2361
02:51:26,514 --> 02:51:30,157
[SPEAKER_18]: And I have a pre-show that starts at 7, although when I'm really bored it starts earlier than that.

2362
02:51:31,158 --> 02:51:35,942
[SPEAKER_18]: And the show starts at 7.30, but because I now have to get my ass up at 5 a.m.

2363
02:51:36,002 --> 02:51:43,047
[SPEAKER_18]: every morning, my show is usually over right at 10.30, unless I'm really bored and I'll keep it going.

2364
02:51:43,788 --> 02:51:50,093
[SPEAKER_18]: But I was supposed to do my show last Tuesday, and I had to do an emergency announcement because I had to get my homework done.

2365
02:51:51,636 --> 02:51:57,943
[SPEAKER_18]: So blame my apartment manager for not turning on my AC, so I couldn't concentrate to do my homework on Monday, so I had to do it on Tuesday.

2366
02:51:59,465 --> 02:52:07,153
[SPEAKER_18]: But as promised, I'm going to be doing Overclocked remixes, and I'm thinking about marathoning another CD.

2367
02:52:07,233 --> 02:52:08,955
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know, maybe Sim & Flow, I don't know.

2368
02:52:09,335 --> 02:52:10,156
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe Echo Image.

2369
02:52:10,356 --> 02:52:11,097
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe Echo Image.

2370
02:52:11,478 --> 02:52:12,158
[SPEAKER_18]: That's a good idea.

2371
02:52:12,178 --> 02:52:12,659
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know, I just...

2372
02:52:13,100 --> 02:52:14,841
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2373
02:52:44,406 --> 02:52:56,816
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we were going to go to break, but it's only ten minutes left in the show, so I thought actually we'd just go ahead and just kind of skip the break and come back to what we were going to do.

2374
02:52:57,416 --> 02:52:58,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, one more show.

2375
02:52:59,098 --> 02:52:59,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh?

2376
02:52:59,498 --> 02:53:00,078
[SPEAKER_05]: One more show.

2377
02:53:00,939 --> 02:53:02,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, I'm sorry, Wednesday nights.

2378
02:53:02,940 --> 02:53:04,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Mikey Style, tell us about Wednesday nights.

2379
02:53:04,862 --> 02:53:09,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Wednesday nights is the night, you know, you're probably like, hey, it's Wednesday night, it's hump night, you know.

2380
02:53:10,326 --> 02:53:12,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Starting to feel good about the work week, you know.

2381
02:53:13,194 --> 02:53:22,440
[SPEAKER_05]: So why don't you come on over and tune in at 7 o'clock at Orange Lounge Radio on Live 365 and listen to Outside the Box.

2382
02:53:23,801 --> 02:53:26,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Because like the name says, it's quite outside the box.

2383
02:53:28,324 --> 02:53:29,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though we talk a lot about boxes.

2384
02:53:30,305 --> 02:53:30,825
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why.

2385
02:53:32,366 --> 02:53:37,730
[SPEAKER_05]: But the main reason why you should listen to the show is because I co-host it with Rice Princess.

2386
02:53:38,516 --> 02:53:40,197
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so it's not just Rob all the time.

2387
02:53:40,217 --> 02:53:43,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Because Rob's the queen that always takes over the show, you know, runs it.

2388
02:53:44,300 --> 02:53:45,922
[SPEAKER_05]: So, please, listen.

2389
02:53:46,362 --> 02:53:47,623
[SPEAKER_05]: 7 o'clock, Wednesday nights.

2390
02:53:50,765 --> 02:53:52,166
[SPEAKER_04]: We have another guest on the song.

2391
02:53:53,668 --> 02:53:56,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and I definitely want to share this one because we're almost out of show.

2392
02:53:56,290 --> 02:53:57,451
[SPEAKER_04]: I really want someone to get it.

2393
02:53:57,491 --> 02:53:59,852
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's an open forum for the rest of the show.

2394
02:54:00,373 --> 02:54:03,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Send in your guesses for the rest of the show and hopefully someone gets it.

2395
02:54:03,455 --> 02:54:04,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's what Jazz guessed.

2396
02:54:05,114 --> 02:54:05,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, don't even.

2397
02:54:05,954 --> 02:54:07,015
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to get somebody in trouble.

2398
02:54:08,215 --> 02:54:09,115
[SPEAKER_18]: I have a guess.

2399
02:54:09,355 --> 02:54:09,595
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

2400
02:54:10,135 --> 02:54:10,796
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a song.

2401
02:54:10,936 --> 02:54:11,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it is.

2402
02:54:11,896 --> 02:54:12,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Flow walk.

2403
02:54:12,476 --> 02:54:13,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get a flow walk on mic.

2404
02:54:14,517 --> 02:54:15,357
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, lay it on me.

2405
02:54:15,657 --> 02:54:19,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Jazz is guessing nucleus with something smooth.

2406
02:54:19,498 --> 02:54:24,339
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a cell in the body that does not have a nucleus, and the jelly and cream cheese on the bagel are both smooth.

2407
02:54:24,879 --> 02:54:26,160
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give you something smooth.

2408
02:54:27,380 --> 02:54:27,820
[SPEAKER_26]: Wow.

2409
02:54:28,561 --> 02:54:32,662
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, when I said people were onto something, I was not kidding.

2410
02:54:33,122 --> 02:54:33,942
[SPEAKER_26]: He is onto it.

2411
02:54:34,585 --> 02:54:36,166
[SPEAKER_26]: However, he is only half right.

2412
02:54:37,086 --> 02:54:43,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, well, you got ten minutes to figure it out, or else you're going to go another week without knowing.

2413
02:54:43,288 --> 02:54:43,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, guys.

2414
02:54:44,149 --> 02:54:46,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob, I think we should just keep playing Gem and Marble.

2415
02:54:46,970 --> 02:54:48,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Nah, just don't even go there.

2416
02:54:48,590 --> 02:54:50,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Just don't even go there, because you're going to get somebody in trouble.

2417
02:54:51,371 --> 02:54:51,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up.

2418
02:54:52,352 --> 02:54:52,652
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2419
02:54:53,712 --> 02:54:55,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you're not allowed to talk the rest of the show.

2420
02:54:55,553 --> 02:54:55,893
[SPEAKER_08]: Give me!

2421
02:54:56,133 --> 02:54:58,954
[SPEAKER_08]: Ducky, ducky, ducky, ducky, ducky!

2422
02:54:58,994 --> 02:55:00,115
[SPEAKER_18]: Give to Radical.

2423
02:55:01,695 --> 02:55:03,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do some Ask Orange Lounge, boys and girls.

2424
02:55:10,221 --> 02:55:13,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

2425
02:55:13,685 --> 02:55:17,068
[SPEAKER_04]: What will we find out tonight on Ask Orange Lounge?

2426
02:55:17,609 --> 02:55:24,335
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to make a jam and then we're going to get it on and hopefully someone will get that clue right.

2427
02:55:24,956 --> 02:55:25,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you say jam?

2428
02:55:26,898 --> 02:55:27,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on.

2429
02:55:28,956 --> 02:55:30,497
[SPEAKER_18]: This show's on something after all.

2430
02:55:31,798 --> 02:55:34,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Skyblind's open as well, but please don't call if you've already been on this show.

2431
02:55:34,880 --> 02:55:36,541
[SPEAKER_04]: We want other people to have a chance.

2432
02:55:37,101 --> 02:55:42,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, I'm just saying that, you know, don't, you know, spread the love.

2433
02:55:42,585 --> 02:55:43,986
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder how jam shots would be.

2434
02:55:44,066 --> 02:55:44,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up!

2435
02:55:45,547 --> 02:55:47,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up, seriously.

2436
02:55:48,568 --> 02:55:51,070
[SPEAKER_04]: People are never going to come back to this program.

2437
02:55:52,231 --> 02:55:52,551
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2438
02:55:57,503 --> 02:55:57,803
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2439
02:55:59,504 --> 02:56:04,667
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to take some questions from our chat room, but I don't see any questions.

2440
02:56:04,767 --> 02:56:06,368
[SPEAKER_18]: Ask your question now.

2441
02:56:07,889 --> 02:56:10,070
[SPEAKER_18]: Shut up, Loki.

2442
02:56:10,751 --> 02:56:13,092
[SPEAKER_03]: I swear to God I'm going to clock you with this microphone.

2443
02:56:13,592 --> 02:56:15,313
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, don't clock him.

2444
02:56:19,415 --> 02:56:19,796
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2445
02:56:20,896 --> 02:56:21,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Zachu has a question.

2446
02:56:22,037 --> 02:56:22,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Legend of Zachu has a question.

2447
02:56:23,598 --> 02:56:25,499
[SPEAKER_04]: How did you spend your summer vacation?

2448
02:56:27,060 --> 02:56:33,986
[SPEAKER_18]: At work, answering 40 plus calls in queue from people trying to get student loans to go to school.

2449
02:56:34,386 --> 02:56:36,088
[SPEAKER_18]: That's how I spent my summer vacation.

2450
02:56:36,208 --> 02:56:36,628
[SPEAKER_18]: Next!

2451
02:56:40,992 --> 02:56:46,477
[SPEAKER_06]: At work, supposedly answering calls, but... Eh, supposedly.

2452
02:56:46,657 --> 02:56:46,877
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2453
02:56:47,137 --> 02:56:51,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, um... I added it!

2454
02:56:51,801 --> 02:56:53,503
[SPEAKER_06]: It's my own word now.

2455
02:56:54,242 --> 02:56:56,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways.

2456
02:56:56,944 --> 02:57:00,686
[SPEAKER_06]: I was supposed to be answering calls, but I was browsing the internet instead.

2457
02:57:02,187 --> 02:57:03,127
[SPEAKER_18]: Yay, internet!

2458
02:57:03,688 --> 02:57:06,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Like many of you, I spent my summer not getting laid.

2459
02:57:07,110 --> 02:57:08,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Luckily, summer's over.

2460
02:57:08,691 --> 02:57:09,771
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not included in that.

2461
02:57:11,672 --> 02:57:12,613
[SPEAKER_04]: I was talking to our chat room.

2462
02:57:12,753 --> 02:57:15,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, FloWalk, how did you spend your summer vacation?

2463
02:57:16,595 --> 02:57:20,598
[SPEAKER_26]: In a room right underneath an air conditioning vent, making step data for...

2464
02:57:21,533 --> 02:57:22,273
[SPEAKER_26]: Someone figured it out.

2465
02:57:45,808 --> 02:57:47,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Finally, we have a winner.

2466
02:57:48,030 --> 02:57:50,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank God, we get to play the damn song before the night's over.

2467
02:57:51,252 --> 02:57:52,453
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't say.

2468
02:57:52,953 --> 02:57:54,875
[SPEAKER_26]: So, what's the guess, Rob?

2469
02:57:54,895 --> 02:57:55,976
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, who got it, first of all?

2470
02:57:56,016 --> 02:57:58,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the winner is White Rob, is the person who got it.

2471
02:57:58,477 --> 02:57:59,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Not me, I'm a White Rob as well.

2472
02:58:01,280 --> 02:58:02,060
[SPEAKER_11]: Ho, ho, ho.

2473
02:58:02,941 --> 02:58:04,902
[SPEAKER_04]: That's very obvious, given your outfit, Rob.

2474
02:58:05,803 --> 02:58:08,705
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm giving him permission to tell our chat room what it is.

2475
02:58:08,805 --> 02:58:13,949
[SPEAKER_04]: So, the next thing White Rob says to you guys will be the name of the new song.

2476
02:58:14,209 --> 02:58:15,310
[SPEAKER_04]: God, it's about time.

2477
02:58:15,629 --> 02:58:16,989
[SPEAKER_04]: So WhiteRob, it's on you, buddy.

2478
02:58:18,510 --> 02:58:19,850
[SPEAKER_04]: He does not have Skype.

2479
02:58:19,870 --> 02:58:21,891
[SPEAKER_04]: He's on 56k, so he can't Skype him.

2480
02:58:22,311 --> 02:58:23,791
[SPEAKER_04]: But WhiteRob figured it out.

2481
02:58:25,052 --> 02:58:26,872
[SPEAKER_04]: So he just gets to post it in our chatroom.

2482
02:58:26,892 --> 02:58:28,613
[SPEAKER_26]: By the way, I really like this song.

2483
02:58:29,193 --> 02:58:30,133
[SPEAKER_17]: Watch him get booted.

2484
02:58:30,233 --> 02:58:32,094
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to cue it up so you guys can hear some of it.

2485
02:58:34,115 --> 02:58:35,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, but he misspelled it.

2486
02:58:35,775 --> 02:58:37,656
[SPEAKER_04]: He misspelled it, but he still got it right.

2487
02:58:38,076 --> 02:58:38,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Close enough.

2488
02:58:41,097 --> 02:58:41,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Nucleus.

2489
02:58:43,697 --> 02:58:43,938
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

2490
02:58:46,440 --> 02:58:47,442
[SPEAKER_04]: So what is it, guys?

2491
02:58:47,603 --> 02:58:49,226
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's tell the people who are not in the chat room.

2492
02:58:49,246 --> 02:58:49,968
[SPEAKER_04]: What is the song?

2493
02:58:51,230 --> 02:58:51,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody want to say?

2494
02:58:52,092 --> 02:58:53,435
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Slow Walk, you should say.

2495
02:58:54,695 --> 02:59:00,641
[SPEAKER_26]: The song is by a group called Nucleus back from the mid-80s, and the joint is called Jam On It.

2496
02:59:00,801 --> 02:59:03,143
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is a very unique song for DDR.

2497
02:59:03,203 --> 02:59:05,645
[SPEAKER_04]: All I can say is this song is a little bit special for DDR.

2498
02:59:06,185 --> 02:59:11,110
[SPEAKER_04]: The only mix of the song I have is 8 minutes in length, so I'm going to only play you guys a clip, because 8 minutes is a long time.

2499
02:59:11,130 --> 02:59:13,512
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, I'm sure the first, like, minute and a half, two minutes should be good enough.

2500
02:59:14,132 --> 02:59:16,755
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm just going to kind of start in the middle here and see what we get.

2501
02:59:16,795 --> 02:59:17,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

2502
02:59:19,124 --> 02:59:28,927
[SPEAKER_25]: If you don't know how, get ready to learn, cause Cosmo's taking his turn to burn Take a seat, and know when to see, then you add M-O-N-E-R-E-E-D-E-D-E-D-E-D-E-D-E-D-E-D-E-D-E-D-E-D-E-D-E-D-E-D-E-D-E-D-E

2503
02:59:48,885 --> 03:00:13,300
[SPEAKER_21]: Don't get down, let me rock you to the rhythm of the funky sound From hill to hill above sea to sea And when jam on's rocking everybody scream Jam on it, jam on it, on it, on it, on it While we're feeling like we want to dance on that thing Go on ahead and float it Cause jamming on is what we do best It's what separates us from the rest And if you don't think who's there for real Let me tell you what happened to the man who did it

2504
03:00:33,030 --> 03:00:35,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that should give you a good idea of what that song sounds like.

2505
03:00:35,931 --> 03:00:39,192
[SPEAKER_04]: How many of you guys remember that Blast From The Past song there?

2506
03:00:40,552 --> 03:00:45,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully, Dancer X isn't too upset that, you know, somebody got it figured out, but you know what?

2507
03:00:46,034 --> 03:00:49,155
[SPEAKER_04]: That is the longest clue that ever went without being figured out.

2508
03:00:49,275 --> 03:00:51,396
[SPEAKER_04]: So for that, we give Dancer a big

2509
03:00:52,225 --> 03:00:54,366
[SPEAKER_03]: F you, buddy, for making our lives hell.

2510
03:00:54,906 --> 03:00:55,606
[SPEAKER_06]: F you, buddy!

2511
03:00:55,986 --> 03:01:02,308
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't believe they didn't get it after we played Jam and Marmalade on the jazz in It's Raining Men.

2512
03:01:02,388 --> 03:01:08,390
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought that would be like... I thought that was completely obvious, too, but I guess people just... People don't think we can have any fun with it.

2513
03:01:08,410 --> 03:01:10,970
[SPEAKER_26]: Like I said, you guys did not have to think very abstract.

2514
03:01:11,210 --> 03:01:13,711
[SPEAKER_26]: There was a bagel, there was jam on it.

2515
03:01:14,625 --> 03:01:17,146
[SPEAKER_26]: and the bagel kind of looked like a nucleus or something.

2516
03:01:17,166 --> 03:01:17,826
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, don't blame me.

2517
03:01:17,846 --> 03:01:19,567
[SPEAKER_26]: That's probably DancerX's lame idea.

2518
03:01:20,968 --> 03:01:24,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't explain the method to your guys' madness, you know, or to his madness.

2519
03:01:25,090 --> 03:01:27,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Our madness is, we give you clues, you suffer.

2520
03:01:29,392 --> 03:01:30,372
[SPEAKER_26]: Rinse, repeat.

2521
03:01:31,332 --> 03:01:34,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2522
03:01:37,745 --> 03:01:40,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Hope you guys enjoyed, and congratulations, WhiteRob, for figuring that out.

2523
03:01:40,807 --> 03:01:42,488
[SPEAKER_04]: You all owe him sex.

2524
03:01:42,868 --> 03:01:43,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Or her.

2525
03:01:43,448 --> 03:01:44,969
[SPEAKER_04]: I imagine it's a him, though, because his name's Rob.

2526
03:01:45,349 --> 03:01:49,211
[SPEAKER_04]: You all owe him sex for getting that right before the end of the show, just under the wire.

2527
03:01:49,332 --> 03:01:50,852
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll send him some chocolate instead.

2528
03:01:50,912 --> 03:01:51,553
[SPEAKER_18]: Same difference.

2529
03:01:53,794 --> 03:01:54,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2530
03:01:55,315 --> 03:01:59,797
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll buy him one of those blow-up pillows from JList.com.

2531
03:02:00,258 --> 03:02:02,119
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to say, I'm excited to play that song.

2532
03:02:02,159 --> 03:02:02,919
[SPEAKER_04]: It's booty as it is.

2533
03:02:02,999 --> 03:02:05,781
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it brings back Solo, everything that was great about Solo.

2534
03:02:06,365 --> 03:02:10,766
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, I think this is just showing up, like, for Ultramix 2, how eclectic the music really is.

2535
03:02:10,826 --> 03:02:17,268
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, you heard everything from, like, you know, just sort of, like, you heard trance, you've heard house.

2536
03:02:17,288 --> 03:02:22,589
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, obviously now you're hearing, like, old school rap, so we're trying to touch as many, yeah, you know, break it.

2537
03:02:22,629 --> 03:02:24,609
[SPEAKER_26]: We're just trying to hit as many bases as we can.

2538
03:02:26,370 --> 03:02:26,850
[SPEAKER_04]: More to come.

2539
03:02:29,311 --> 03:02:31,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Any fun ideas for clues in the future?

2540
03:02:32,864 --> 03:02:36,405
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know, we're still working on what to do next.

2541
03:02:36,666 --> 03:02:37,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2542
03:02:37,706 --> 03:02:40,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, you know what guys, it's time to wrap up the show.

2543
03:02:40,247 --> 03:02:41,988
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate to say it, but the show's about over here.

2544
03:02:42,408 --> 03:02:45,949
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

2545
03:02:46,049 --> 03:02:49,431
[SPEAKER_04]: And for those of you guys that didn't get your Ask Orange Lounge questions in, stay tuned to Afterbirth.

2546
03:02:49,451 --> 03:02:50,271
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get those answered.

2547
03:02:51,552 --> 03:02:53,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, let's start with LankyStyle, your final thought.

2548
03:02:56,174 --> 03:02:56,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

2549
03:02:58,054 --> 03:03:02,016
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's go to... Oh, I've been drinking a little bit and I feel pretty good.

2550
03:03:02,566 --> 03:03:03,186
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, sounds good.

2551
03:03:03,846 --> 03:03:05,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to, I guess, Floatwalk.

2552
03:03:05,987 --> 03:03:06,447
[SPEAKER_04]: You get a mic.

2553
03:03:06,587 --> 03:03:07,227
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your final thought?

2554
03:03:08,307 --> 03:03:09,907
[SPEAKER_26]: Message over to you, same in the chat room.

2555
03:03:09,927 --> 03:03:13,428
[SPEAKER_26]: I got three letters for you, L-O-L.

2556
03:03:14,228 --> 03:03:16,008
[SPEAKER_04]: And Sharkscroll, your final thought?

2557
03:03:16,348 --> 03:03:18,489
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm feeling very Jerry Springer here.

2558
03:03:19,209 --> 03:03:19,549
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2559
03:03:21,329 --> 03:03:22,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Angel, your final thought?

2560
03:03:22,890 --> 03:03:24,270
[SPEAKER_19]: I got a present from Loki.

2561
03:03:24,610 --> 03:03:24,970
[SPEAKER_19]: Yay.

2562
03:03:25,590 --> 03:03:26,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.

2563
03:03:26,770 --> 03:03:27,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the CD?

2564
03:03:27,570 --> 03:03:28,671
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, the CD.

2565
03:03:29,491 --> 03:03:30,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Explicit, your final thought?

2566
03:03:34,482 --> 03:03:35,523
[SPEAKER_27]: Can you come back to me on that one?

2567
03:03:36,204 --> 03:03:36,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I what?

2568
03:03:36,784 --> 03:03:37,165
[SPEAKER_27]: Come back.

2569
03:03:37,405 --> 03:03:37,565
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

2570
03:03:38,806 --> 03:03:39,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn you!

2571
03:03:40,107 --> 03:03:41,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Loki, your final thought.

2572
03:03:43,249 --> 03:03:44,951
[SPEAKER_06]: If I shake my head, I get dizzy.

2573
03:03:47,053 --> 03:03:48,013
[SPEAKER_04]: He's getting drunk, guys.

2574
03:03:48,314 --> 03:03:49,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Gypsy Wolf, your final thought.

2575
03:03:53,938 --> 03:03:56,640
[SPEAKER_07]: Whoever's throwing beer bottles at people for waving, keep doing it.

2576
03:03:56,680 --> 03:03:57,381
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of entertaining.

2577
03:04:00,744 --> 03:04:01,924
[SPEAKER_04]: My final thought is...

2578
03:04:03,092 --> 03:04:06,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen to our station a lot and whore up our hours and win an Akira Yamaoka CD.

2579
03:04:10,338 --> 03:04:11,379
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

2580
03:04:13,321 --> 03:04:21,228
[SPEAKER_18]: My final thought is I want to go on leave and travel, but I want to be paid for it.

2581
03:04:21,948 --> 03:04:23,390
[SPEAKER_18]: So pay me to travel.

2582
03:04:24,050 --> 03:04:27,833
[SPEAKER_18]: Send me to... What the fuck are you doing with that CD?

2583
03:04:32,230 --> 03:04:35,631
[SPEAKER_18]: My final thought is... I want air conditioning!

2584
03:04:36,731 --> 03:04:37,071
[SPEAKER_18]: And money.

2585
03:04:38,612 --> 03:04:38,952
[SPEAKER_18]: And sex.

2586
03:04:39,272 --> 03:04:39,612
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2587
03:04:40,012 --> 03:04:42,193
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to give... Wow.

2588
03:04:42,533 --> 03:04:43,013
[SPEAKER_04]: In that order?

2589
03:04:43,473 --> 03:04:45,433
[SPEAKER_18]: In that order, because air conditioning is more important.

2590
03:04:45,673 --> 03:04:45,934
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2591
03:04:46,914 --> 03:04:50,355
[SPEAKER_04]: The final word of tonight's show, I'm going to give it to somebody who didn't say a whole lot tonight.

2592
03:04:50,455 --> 03:04:53,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Shark Skrull, you've got to give us one word that sums everything up.

2593
03:04:54,216 --> 03:04:55,776
[SPEAKER_04]: The final word of the show.

2594
03:04:56,276 --> 03:04:57,917
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, my friend Donna will understand this.

2595
03:04:58,597 --> 03:04:59,137
[SPEAKER_16]: Beans!

2596
03:04:59,157 --> 03:04:59,277
[SPEAKER_16]: Beans!

2597
03:05:00,706 --> 03:05:05,571
[SPEAKER_28]: That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

2598
03:05:06,392 --> 03:05:10,616
[SPEAKER_28]: Orange Lounge Radio Live is an Orange Lounge Radio production.

[SPEAKER_28]: And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.

2601
03:05:37,546 --> 03:05:41,049
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh my god, Becky, look at her butt.

2602
03:05:42,370 --> 03:05:44,592
[SPEAKER_14]: It is so big.

2603
03:05:45,133 --> 03:05:48,536
[SPEAKER_14]: I like big butts and I cannot buy.

2604
03:05:49,456 --> 03:06:00,566
[SPEAKER_14]: You other brothers can't deny that when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist and a round thing in your face, you get sprung.

2605
03:06:10,523 --> 03:06:27,012
[SPEAKER_14]: But that butt you got makes me so horny Cause I'm long and I'm strong And I'm down to get the friction on So fellas, fellas Has your girlfriend got the butt?

2606
03:06:28,093 --> 03:06:39,740
[SPEAKER_14]: Tell her to shake it, shake it Shake that healthy butt Baby got back Baby got back

2607
03:06:41,843 --> 03:06:47,352
[SPEAKER_14]: Baby got bad, baby got bad

[SPEAKER_14]: Then turn around, stick it out Even white boys gotta shout Baby got back Baby got back Baby got back Baby got back Little in the middle but you got much back Little in the middle but you got much back

2609
03:07:54,219 --> 03:08:00,443
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

2610
03:08:38,150 --> 03:08:42,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, here's the afterbirth, the part of the show after the credits have faded to black.

2611
03:08:43,112 --> 03:08:49,235
[SPEAKER_04]: I gotta make this quick tonight because I'm going out tonight, but I wanted to get the rest of these Ask Orange Lounge questions in because there were some good ones in here.

2612
03:08:50,676 --> 03:08:52,917
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't think anyone was going to get the jam on it thing.

2613
03:08:53,057 --> 03:08:53,777
[SPEAKER_04]: I seriously didn't.

2614
03:08:53,837 --> 03:08:54,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Two minutes left in the show.

2615
03:08:54,938 --> 03:08:59,020
[SPEAKER_06]: It was my drunkenness and saying I should do jam shots that clued them in.

2616
03:09:01,421 --> 03:09:06,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Sigurd was going to ask, Dear Ask Orange Lounge, why can't the chat room figure out this easy clue?

2617
03:09:06,683 --> 03:09:07,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you got owned, didn't you?

2618
03:09:12,757 --> 03:09:15,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark Knight says, I got one out of all the drunk shows.

2619
03:09:15,720 --> 03:09:18,522
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the record for most drinks in an episode?

2620
03:09:19,002 --> 03:09:19,663
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a guess.

2621
03:09:20,143 --> 03:09:21,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe DarkSakura wants to share.

2622
03:09:22,165 --> 03:09:23,566
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, what are you talking about?

2623
03:09:23,586 --> 03:09:26,768
[SPEAKER_18]: The time I had, like, what, ten beverages within an hour?

2624
03:09:26,788 --> 03:09:27,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, you think?

2625
03:09:28,990 --> 03:09:33,613
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, the last drunk show that we did, I had four double shots of tequila.

2626
03:09:35,575 --> 03:09:36,536
[SPEAKER_18]: That's cheap-ass stuff, too.

2627
03:09:37,748 --> 03:09:43,390
[SPEAKER_18]: I had half a bottle of the mudslide mix, the TGR Friday's mudslide.

2628
03:09:44,090 --> 03:09:51,293
[SPEAKER_18]: I finished off the rest about that much of a bottle, about maybe three inches worth of a bottle of the Long Island Iced Tea.

2629
03:09:51,313 --> 03:09:51,973
[SPEAKER_18]: What else did I have?

2630
03:09:52,033 --> 03:09:56,194
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh yeah, and I kept making these screwdrivers out of Malibu.

2631
03:09:57,895 --> 03:09:59,255
[SPEAKER_18]: And I kept drinking those too.

2632
03:10:00,276 --> 03:10:04,297
[SPEAKER_18]: So I was very drunk, and the thing is, is that where I have really good tolerance,

2633
03:10:05,197 --> 03:10:07,778
[SPEAKER_18]: That much alcohol in the span of an hour.

2634
03:10:08,318 --> 03:10:11,900
[SPEAKER_18]: I ended up passing out on Rob's bed and eating like half of Matt's box of waffles.

2635
03:10:12,880 --> 03:10:13,640
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I remember that.

2636
03:10:14,901 --> 03:10:16,621
[SPEAKER_18]: Which I probably still owe you the waffles.

2637
03:10:17,602 --> 03:10:18,302
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2638
03:10:18,422 --> 03:10:19,883
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll get you some waffles.

2639
03:10:19,943 --> 03:10:23,804
[SPEAKER_06]: Tonight I had, what was it, five screwdrivers.

2640
03:10:24,364 --> 03:10:27,085
[SPEAKER_06]: All of them with two shots of vodka in them.

2641
03:10:27,366 --> 03:10:30,987
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess that'd be ten shots of vodka over the course of three hours.

2642
03:10:31,457 --> 03:10:33,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, really, I don't feel that drunk.

2643
03:10:33,418 --> 03:10:34,379
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I'm a little dizzy.

2644
03:10:34,679 --> 03:10:38,321
[SPEAKER_17]: Over the course of three hours is a lot better than over the course of an hour.

2645
03:10:38,721 --> 03:10:46,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I didn't want to kill myself, but, you know, um, no, right now I just feel very full because that's like a whole thing of orange juice right there.

2646
03:10:47,006 --> 03:10:49,007
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's a lot of orange juice.

2647
03:10:49,188 --> 03:10:51,329
[SPEAKER_05]: What I'm worried about, though, Loki, sorry.

2648
03:10:53,510 --> 03:10:58,193
[SPEAKER_05]: What I'm worried about, though, Loki, is you haven't, like, I haven't seen you go to the bathroom in these three hour spans.

2649
03:10:59,200 --> 03:11:01,341
[SPEAKER_05]: You're a time bomb waiting to go off, man.

2650
03:11:02,061 --> 03:11:02,401
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

2651
03:11:02,641 --> 03:11:06,823
[SPEAKER_05]: You drink that much alcohol and orange juice, something's going to explode, man.

2652
03:11:07,623 --> 03:11:09,203
[SPEAKER_06]: My stomach, yeah.

2653
03:11:09,223 --> 03:11:12,845
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, all over the... No, I've never thrown up from alcohol.

2654
03:11:12,885 --> 03:11:14,365
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not throwing up, I'm talking about something else.

2655
03:11:14,385 --> 03:11:15,586
[SPEAKER_05]: You haven't thrown up from the bathroom.

2656
03:11:17,366 --> 03:11:18,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, what's bathroom really?

2657
03:11:19,987 --> 03:11:20,327
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways.

2658
03:11:21,227 --> 03:11:23,208
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not into water sports, so take care of that.

2659
03:11:26,338 --> 03:11:27,399
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll wake up in the middle of the night.

2660
03:11:27,459 --> 03:11:28,900
[SPEAKER_08]: Why am I all wet?

2661
03:11:29,060 --> 03:11:30,781
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got to hurry up through the rest of these questions, you guys.

2662
03:11:31,442 --> 03:11:35,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Zaku, will you be playing drunk DDR and or any Bomani tonight?

2663
03:11:38,168 --> 03:11:38,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably not.

2664
03:11:39,029 --> 03:11:40,790
[SPEAKER_04]: I think most people are going home, and I'm going to the club.

2665
03:11:41,531 --> 03:11:43,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Karma Titan says, question number 108.

2666
03:11:43,973 --> 03:11:45,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Booga, booga, booga.

2667
03:11:45,114 --> 03:11:45,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay or nay?

2668
03:11:49,738 --> 03:11:51,319
[SPEAKER_18]: If you're referring to Booga, Booga...

2669
03:11:52,677 --> 03:11:54,639
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I'm not playing any game where I stick a finger up someone's ass.

2670
03:11:54,679 --> 03:11:55,880
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was just Booga Booga Booga.

2671
03:11:56,320 --> 03:11:57,641
[SPEAKER_04]: I say yay to Booga Booga Booga.

2672
03:11:57,721 --> 03:11:58,802
[SPEAKER_18]: Booga Booga Booga is cool.

2673
03:11:59,302 --> 03:12:00,303
[SPEAKER_18]: Booga Booga is not.

2674
03:12:00,323 --> 03:12:01,684
[SPEAKER_04]: What is Booga Booga Booga?

2675
03:12:01,804 --> 03:12:02,184
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2676
03:12:03,265 --> 03:12:04,947
[SPEAKER_04]: Shay23, last question.

2677
03:12:05,327 --> 03:12:08,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Any idea when the 8th style limited edition can be bought?

2678
03:12:11,492 --> 03:12:13,553
[SPEAKER_06]: Taking pre-orders on Konami style already.
