1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Oh, the sweet child saves me

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And so long that confines me

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Confines me

4
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Yesterday, back and forth, broken doors no longer open

5
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Breaking down, even now, love is gonna ruin those days

6
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Not again, not again, not again

7
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
A dream I can't awake

8
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
What is real, what is real, what is real

9
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's cutting hard for me to take

10
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
What I need, what I need, what I need

11
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
A little bit of the night

12
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
And the white sugar's in the eyes

13
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Oh, the sweet sugar saves me

14
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Heckle when they confide in me

15
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:18,760

B-b-b-cocky.

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,600
Just kidding. Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that in this episode.

24
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,600

32
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,600

the news about what the latest clue is all about.

68
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:43,060
We're not going to, I've got to clarify something though.

69
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:47,940
We're not blatantly giving you the song, we're just giving you a little kick in the ass.

70
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:51,300
Give me a little kick in the ass to get you charged up and figure out what that song is

71
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,020
all about.

72
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:57,580
All this and plenty of Bomani news, How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day, Ask Orange Lounge,

73
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:00,920
and all that crap you've loved for the past four seasons.

74
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:07,060
When we come back from this break, featuring songs from Popin' Music 11, Woot, in this

75
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:12,220
break we're going to hear a Sana song called Space Dog, Megumi with Frost, and a little

76
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,300
bit of Hong Kong magic from Yamato.

77
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,300
We'll be right back.

78
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:26,300
A day ago, on a space door, to the next room in order stop.

79
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:34,300
Can you hear me on a space door? The earth is shining through.

80
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:43,300
A day ago, on a space door, to seek my mother goodnight now.

81
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:57,300
I remember the time, when I was born

82
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:08,300
You were searching to me, in the games that made me glad

83
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:12,300
One day he told to me

84
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:17,300
I'll go home, you will get to see

85
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,300
And let us go, he's my friend

86
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:26,300
Never mind, you'll be born and born

87
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:30,300
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

88
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,300
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

89
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,300
Oh, oh, oh, oh

90
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,300
Can you believe in me?

91
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,300
I'm glad you're up

92
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,300
You're gonna be lucky

93
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,300
Under the light

94
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:47,300
And the reason I'm sad

95
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:51,300
Is to leave you for a long time

96
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,300
Don't care on me

97
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,300
I'm glad you're up

98
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,300
I'm gonna be lucky

99
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:04,300
Under the sun

100
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,300
I

101
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,300
I'm not another phone

102
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:38,200
T-O, L-A-V-D-E-T O-T-I

103
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,700
M-A-O-P-O-N-O-T-I-M-O-T-I-T-I-T-E

104
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:48,340
Don't get me!

105
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:41,220
Hi, this is Mel B of RTF.

106
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:46,720
And for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend, Melody, can join us on all the fun together.

107
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,260
Hey, hey, if you're a broke-ass like I am, why don't you come to the one place that costs

108
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:53,740
absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.

109
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:56,260
It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.

110
00:13:56,260 --> 00:14:00,980
Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.

111
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,260
Gee, that guy sounds awfully familiar.

112
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,260
I...

113
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,260
Honestly, that was.

114
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,360
He sounds like somebody I've heard from very recently.

115
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,700
He sounds very, very familiar to me.

116
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,700
How you doing, Flow-Walk?

117
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:15,460
walk? Oh man, it's been pretty busy lately and I have no idea who the hell you're

118
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:20,480
talking about from that promo. Yeah, the answer is hazy. I don't know

119
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,860

132
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:35,440
to SKU, and then something that I'm sure Melody will expand on as well.

133
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:46,320
Interview. We got interviewed for a magazine. For a Lifetime magazine. Like

134
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:55,880
Lifetime TV for women? I guess so. For the fitness benefits of DDR.

135
00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:08,960
So, coming up next on Lifetime, Sally Field stars in My Burning Vagina, a story about

136
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:15,000
a woman overcoming her vaginal difficulties in that time of the month.

137
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,080
Also coming up, Sharks Girl and Dark Sakura, interviewed about DDR.

138
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:34,200
Did you hear how DDR helped them overcome their burning vaginas?

139
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:40,160
God I love this show.

140
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,280
We jumped the shark like when?

141
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,200
Like episode 2?

142
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,200
Episode 2.

143
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,600
Because I wasn't here.

144
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,600
That set the pace.

145
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:58,700
going on vacation for two weeks like bye y'all I'm going to Alabama anyway um so

146
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:07,560
uh my week has been kinda kind of okay um I just hung out did stuff went to

147
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:12,020
school spent a lot of time at school did homework because I still have no

148
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:16,940
air-conditioning that's coming up in the FUs of the week and that's really by the

149
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:20,620
By the way, as a reminder, Orensons Radio is based in the Sacramento Valley, where we

150
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:23,140
get temperatures of 110 degrees in the summertime.

151
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:26,860
Yeah, and if you don't have AC, it sucks!

152
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:31,020
And if you don't have AC in your car, it sucks even more, because I could have just escaped

153
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,020
to my car.

154
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:36,260
Dan's like, summer's almost over, we don't have to get AC for your car now.

155
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:42,220
As my mother said, you use the old, uh, as my mother said, you use the old, uh, two and

156
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,220
seventy trick.

157
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:46,260
You roll down two windows and drive seventy miles an hour.

158
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:50,260
You know what? That would work if one of my windows would roll down.

159
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,260
You's in the ghetto.

160
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:59,260
Dude, no, it's not. I don't know what it is, but after my car got raped it hasn't been the same.

161
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,260
Your car got raped?

162
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,260
My car got raped, remember?

163
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:04,260
Did it have a burning vagina afterwards?

164
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,260
It got raped in the side.

165
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,260
Oh, okay.

166
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,260
Remember when they broke into my...

167
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,260
Oh my God, it got raped in the ear?

168
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,260

177
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,840
job and when you were young did you used to ban children from the playground is

178

180
00:18:56,300 --> 00:19:02,220

DDR angel how was your week how was your day well let's see you better have a

182
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:08,820
mike nearby because you may laugh at this

183
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,160
i found out

184
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,780
uh... i mean

185
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,320
what uh...

186
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:19,140
okay i found out that there is a haunted house by my old house that i used to live at that

187
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,200
i just moved away from

188
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,060
no it's not the fort but you know what

189
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:25,800
i was gonna blame it on loki's little uh...

190
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:30,040
portal from hell but i can't because it's not even built yet

191
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,360
and then

192
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,720
after i found out about the house

193
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,760
uh...

194
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:41,140
I found out that two days ago it miraculously burned down without affecting any of the vegetation

195
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:44,340
around it or the tree, or the oak tree that was right next to it.

196
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:47,300
I see burning as a running theme on tonight's show.

197
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,300
Apparently.

198
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,460
Was it someone's vagina that...

199
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,460
Ah, da, da, da.

200
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,460
Ah, da, da.

201
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,460
Okay, okay, enough.

202
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,260
Let the joke die.

203
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,020
Step away from the joke.

204
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:01,060
Speaking of joke, should I reveal it now or later?

205
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,300
I think we need to do Loki's present now.

206
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,300
Okay.

207
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,900

00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,700
upon all jokes

223
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,940
i thought it was really cool

224
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:59,420
hopefully he likes it

225
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:02,060
it must go on the webcam oh my other side

226
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,620
it's a little baby

227
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:08,700
yes it is but what does the baby what is the baby holding

228
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:12,620
did it drop something i think it dropped something

229
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:17,020
besides the card

230
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:19,620
i had a little help with the artwork but uh...

231
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:24,300
for those uh... listening at home loki has been given an iraqi suicide baby for

232
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:27,420
his birthday

233
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:31,200
for those of you who have been listening about fifty episodes ago you'll get that inside joke

234
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,460
at the bed and then i went ahead and then it's a bad and i don't think it's

235
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,200
one that you know

236
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,740
burnt to the ground but i had to bring it yet

237
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,240
okay anything

238
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,500
i thought it was cool

239
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,660
i'll be like that

240
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:47,660
anything on the webcam now

241
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:54,660
it

242
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,660
He broke the webcam! For five seconds!

243
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,660
Alright, moving on.

244
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:06,660
Angel, is there anything else you want to talk about with your week?

245
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:10,660
Not that I can think of at the moment. I will probably get the mic later.

246
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:15,660
Then let's speak to Mr. Floatwalk. How was your week? How was your day?

247
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:22,660
Ah, the week. Well, anyone who knows what I do, it's just been non-stop work for this whole week

248
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:27,260
So many things getting ready to ship out, you know for this Christmas season

249
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:32,100
So, you know, I heard a rumor you work for some game company. Yeah who to thunk it

250
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:40,620
Let's see, but the cool things about that my match to steal myself some good swag during the week got some Silent Hill four posters

251
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,060
so

252
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,740
No, it was given I asked and I took

253
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:51,660
took. It's a cool thing to go into their boiler room and see all the promo stuff from every

254
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:56,580
game that's ever been made and like posters, boxes, all that. It's pretty neat. And I saw

255
00:22:56,580 --> 00:23:03,760
about 500 extreme vrares. Ooh. Can I visit Konami and borrow things? Well, you do know

256
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,700
me. You know, I mean, my name doesn't have a lot of clout out there. Just don't turn

257
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:12,980
into a name dropper. You know, that's not bad. I won't. I'm not like a particular pool

258
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:18,580
ball anyway i'm sorry sorry but yeah the other stuff in the week um actually went to a concert

259
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:25,700
on friday night went to go see uh kanye west and usher in concert and uh that was it was

260
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:30,340
a pretty it was a pretty happening event but uh i must say there was it was pretty entertaining

261
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:36,820
just to see the crowd right on idea what kind of crowd did they have in an usher concert

262
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:41,940
i'm curious well everything you expect every girl from like 12 to 35 you know just chicks

263
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:45,180
everywhere. Did Usher take his shirt off at some point during the concert?

264
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:49,260
Oh, you can tell. You didn't even have to see the stage. You just heard, like, the loudest

265
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:55,620
screaming you've ever heard. Imagine, like, 20,000 banshees going wild on them. That was

266
00:23:55,620 --> 00:24:00,700
just real. I mean, it's funny to see just how girls react over just one guy on stage.

267
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:04,740
I mean, one of the funniest stories about that, I mean, I have, like, so many stories

268
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:08,340
about that concert alone, but probably the funniest one was, there was one scene, one

269
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:12,540
part like in the middle of the show where he's doing a ballad so normally

270
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:15,700
what any you know singer does he grabs some like lucky woman off the stage it

271
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:19,200
he's gonna serenade her so he looks around and he points out this one gal in

272
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,680
the crowd and when you see this gal like the spotlights going on there she's like

273
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:26,100
totally freaking out she's you know I you just look at her face because they

274
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:30,600
put the you know camera on the projection screen and I can say from the

275
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:34,540
time she got picked to the time she got offstage you did not see her smile once

276
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:37,380
She was too busy totally like freaking out making the sad face like

277
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:41,020
Like maybe her vagina was but never mind

278
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:45,540
Doesn't I sure have a song called burn

279
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,500
Yes as a matter of fact

280
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:55,560
Funny no, but um so like what they do is when the dancers like they spot this girl the dancers escort her out on stage

281
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,820
But she's not on stage yet

282
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:00,740
They put her on just like velvet couches sort sort when you see her on the couch

283
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:03,060
She's like absolutely shaking like a leaf just like

284
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:08,900
And it's funny I'm just seeing her thinking like the imagery of this girl like on a you know velvet bed or whatever shaking

285
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,660
I'm thinking man. I ain't seen that since prom night, man

286
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:19,180
Seriously, but it's like cuz now you see usher get up on stage, and he's like walking slowly taking his time

287
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,220
He gets up there

288
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:25,320
You know he's got like a bouquet of flowers for her and you could like when the camera zooms in on her you can see

289
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:30,060
Her face. She's like mouthing. I love you to her you know to him, which is pretty standard any family do that

290
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:34,780
yeah I know I would okay and then so finally like just somewhere around the

291
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:37,620
part where you know you talk about you know I'll get down with you and all that

292
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:41,300
kind of where you're singing that I swear to God I'll put $20 on this you

293
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:45,180
could ask Mike no you can ask little B who saw this I swear she mouth the words

294
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:55,100
I'll let you fuck me I was just like damn I mean there's just some whores in

295
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:58,380
this world I guess I mean I know if it's an Oscar concert a girl says it to a guy

296
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:03,240
He's flattered. I don't know if Beyonce pulled me on stage and I pulled that I'd be out in cuffs in like three seconds

297
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:10,020
So I just found that kind of curious, but overall it was pretty fun. And then um, yeah today it's just been

298
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:15,500
Coming up from the bay up to SACTO and hanging out with you guys then the funds only just begun. That's right

299
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:20,400
We always appreciate when you come and hang out because it's always a good excuse to go have Mongolian barbecue as well always

300
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:25,300
And before I pass the mic just want to say what's up to the chat room, especially up to you Sigurd and Kyle

301
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,300
Word.

302
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:29,780
Yeah, I was gonna say, Sigurd is getting there, he's very antsy in our chat room because he

303
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:33,220
thinks you're ignoring him, when in reality, you couldn't see the chat room because we

304
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,300
were playing with a webcam.

305
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:38,020
So the chat room was down for a little bit, but he's like, Mel doesn't love me, meh meh

306
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,020
meh, my vagina's pretty heavy.

307
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:41,020
I got mad loves for you.

308
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:47,560
And even though my new office mate is still psycho, I still hold a little place in my

309
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,560
heart for you.

310
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:52,580
And I still have a Silent Hill 4 poster if you come back, if I gotta bribe you, I'll

311
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,580
bribe you, man.

312
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,580
How's your tip jar doing?

313
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,580
Uh, we are over thirty dollars.

314
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,580
Where the hell's all this money coming from?

315
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:05,580
Okay, well, I explained it a little earlier in the DDR Freakboards, but the short of it was essentially

316
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:13,580
Me and Sigurd, we used to have a bunch of stuff in our cube, like, if you saw the first montage we ever did, we had, like, red vines, we had, like, granola bars and all that stuff

317
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,580
And so our boss came-

318
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,580
The clue? Clue?

319
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,580
Yeah, clues, quote.

320
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:25,580
Did you, I actually, I wanted to ask you real fast, fast, did you want to issue like a formal apology to the users of DDR Freak for what you did?

321
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:32,580
I will say this, you guys totally assumed it was a clue, I only said which of these would you like to have right about now.

322
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:38,580
I didn't mean to lead you on, you led yourselves, as your own damn fault.

323
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,580
I was gonna tell you not to apologize, but.

324
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,580
Yeah, as your own damn fault.

325
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:45,580
I tried to say about the inkblot thing, but nobody listens to Scott.

326
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:49,580
I know, man. You're the third eye of, you know, DDR Freakup in this piece.

327
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,580
That's alright.

328
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:57,580
But, um, oh gosh, where was I at? Yeah, so, the story was, we had a bunch of stuff, and then our boss came in one day on a Friday afternoon.

329
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:06,580
And saw that we had a bunch of granola bars, and so he just kind of walked up to us, not saying a word, grabbed about three granola bars, dropped a dollar on the table and just walked off.

330
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:12,580
We were like, what the hell did he just do? And then, you know, we were just thinking for the rest of the day, wow, that was kind of freaky.

331
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:18,580
And he comes back to us later and tells us, well, he was doing interviews like all day for people, you know, coming to Konami,

332
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:23,580
and he just didn't have time to go on a lunch break, and so he figured, well, hey, the testers have food.

333
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:30,580
So he just grabbed some from us and dropped the dollar as, you know, just payment for, you know, well, I don't want to feel like I'm mooching.

334
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:36,580
And then just people started picking up on it, and then what started out as like $1.82 came into $30.

335
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:39,580
I know, I single-handedly put $2.50 in that jar.

336
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:45,580
Yes you did, and Sharks Girl put in her tip as well, and she don't even work there, so just the fact that people are-

337
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:49,580
What exactly is she tipping? Never mind, never mind.

338
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:53,580
Hint, it's not a burning you-know-what.

339
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:58,580
No comment.

340
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:02,580
But yeah, that is a week in the life of moi.

341
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:05,580
Alright. Sounds good.

342
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,580
Sharks Girl.

343
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:07,580
Hi.

344
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:15,340
Hello, long time no see. Since like, what, a couple weeks ago on the great mini golfing

345
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:19,420
expedition? Oh, that was beautiful. That was beautiful. The night we weren't allowed to

346
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:23,680
go to the Konami dinner, we were excommunicated from the dinner, so we had to go miniature

347
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,920
golfing at Miggle. Although I have to say, Mel and I went miniature golfing in Santa

348
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:31,600
Cruz last week, and I beat him by one. Good job. Pretty freaking proud of myself. Although

349
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,240
So I would like to remind you that I did school you at Miggle.

350
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever bitch.

351
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,040
Alright.

352
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,680
I was just letting you win.

353
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,320
Oh, oh, I see.

354
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,320
Oh, she let me win.

355
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,320
Did you guys hear that?

356
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,320
She let me win.

357
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:49,800
Yeah, them's fighting words, huh?

358
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,800
Uh-huh.

359
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,320
Alright, so what else did you do this week?

360
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,320
Anything exciting?

361
00:29:54,320 --> 00:30:01,120
I, I worked, which is more so suited for the FUs of the week, and then I woke up yesterday

362
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,400
thinking I'm going to have a wonderful Saturday and realize I cannot turn my head to the right

363
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,400
or the left.

364
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,400
Oh no.

365
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:10,680
So, my neck's been kind of sucks-ore and it still hurts, that's why I let Mel drive up

366
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,680
here.

367
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:15,560
Yeah, I've just been kind of like, hmm, yay, pain.

368
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:18,360
Back medicines are your friend, although they make me sleep.

369
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:21,800
So I've just been kind of really out of it, even for me.

370
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,520
Mmm, cry.

371
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:30,240
So I'll go back to work and I'll have an excuse for being a bitch.

372
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,680
Any shout-outs or anything you want to plug while you're here?

373
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:37,640
I am now addicted to Mario vs. Donkey Kong.

374
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,240
That was a game I could not get into for some reason, I just...

375
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,360
I just played it for five minutes, I'm like, I must buy this game.

376
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,600
I don't know why, I just didn't...

377
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,600
Mario vs. Donkey Kong.

378
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,400
Oh, she's gonna be the Game Boy again.

379
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,260
Yeah, except Mel just dropped it.

380
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,640
Angel comes prepared.

381
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,360
That's right.

382
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,720
Anything else you want to share?

383
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,900
no i'm boring

384
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,560
no you know you know boring

385
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:07,040

386
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:10,120

387
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:13,300
okay i must pull the joke now do you realize you have all three males on the

388
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,140
couch

389
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,920
well that's a good point

390
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:20,320
yeah but people don't know your real name you just gave it away angel

391
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,040
hey hey hey it's only the first three letters they can guess the rest

392
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,040
no nobody start guessing uh...

393
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:29,540
let's see uh... yeah i'm mel

394
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:30,040
No, I'm not.

395
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,660
No, he's float, walk, remember?

396
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,020
Float, walk.

397
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,020
Yeah, see?

398
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,020
Loki, how was your week?

399
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:38,780
How was your day?

400
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:43,540
My day would have been better if my shit didn't crap out on me.

401
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,060
Shit crap?

402
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:47,740
You didn't want my shit crapped.

403
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:50,220
No, I'm talking very vague.

404
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:52,460
I mean, I'm talking about the little board

405
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:54,340
that I had for my cabinet.

406
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:56,580
Not necessarily a main one, because I

407
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,220
didn't play with that today.

408
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:03,220
My smaller one that I was using from MAME before, but it's now being used for everything else,

409
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:06,220
crapped out, and I don't know why.

410
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:09,220
It might have something to do with my shitty soldering job to fix it.

411
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:11,220
I mean, that might have something to do with it.

412
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,220
So I have to get a new one. That sucks.

413
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:16,220
But at least it'll be nice and brand new.

414
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:20,220
Thing is, I had- well, we did get to play a little bit of DDR today.

415
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:24,220
I had it set up so we could play, and it was pretty.

416
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:29,220
And my pads worked really well, but they're loud still, so that sucked.

417
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:35,220
Then yesterday we went to play Qsar, and that rocked because of course I kicked ass anyways.

418
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:38,220
I kicked ass without even effort. Without effort.

419
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:43,220
I was actually spinning around on my ass in the middle of the arena shooting people.

420
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:46,220
Behind my back, all that kind of cool stuff.

421
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,220
Because I rock.

422
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:58,220
Anyways, and then, um, I tried playing DDR on doubles and stuff at the arcade, and I realized I have no more, um, endurance anymore. It's just gone.

423
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:08,220
So, um, yeah, I felt like I was gonna die. And, um, yeah, my feet hurt a lot from all the walking from playing QZR. That kinda sucked, too.

424
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:17,220
And since the girlfriend and sister aren't here, the thing that I thought was haunted is not haunted. I wasted my money. I'm an idiot.

425
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:22,220
That's all we need to know. And that sucked.

426
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:30,220
For those who were listening Wednesday, I bought a haunted doll off the internet, supposedly.

427
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:36,220
But, you know, whatever, it wasn't. So that sucked. And I hate it.

428
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:38,220
Ooh, food!

429
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:41,220
Aww. No food.

430
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,220
And a new guest.

431
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:46,220
Um, but anyways, yeah, so that was that.

432
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:48,220
And, uh, for that. But, um...

433
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:53,220
Oh, and I made a CD. My CD for my remixes and stuff.

434
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:56,220
And, um, yeah.

435
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:59,220
That's pretty much all that I did this week, I think.

436
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:01,220
Oh, and La Final Fantasy.

437
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:05,220
And Logie will be giving away copies of his CD to some of our in-studio guests tonight.

438
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:11,500
exciting. Alright. Who else wants to play How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day? Jonas,

439
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:15,500
hello, thank you for joining us. Hey, what's up y'all? How Was Your Week, How Was Your

440
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:21,540
Day? Uh, the ups and downs. The ups was the tournament being okay, giving St. Kennedy

441
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:26,620
a good time. Oh, I completely forgot about that. Yeah! There was that little, there was

442
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:31,060
a tournament that went on over down at Scandia on Tuesday night here locally. Now, who the

443
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:35,980
hell holds a DER tournament on a Tuesday I have no idea it's their first time I've

444
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:39,300
actually talked to them no it's not because we did like two tournaments there

445
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:44,820
but it's no I mean the actual organizer itself all right whatever but it was

446
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:49,340
like a back-to-school bash type thing and they were given away a trophy as a

447
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:53,020
grand prize and I happen to know the guy that won it was actually toady if you

448
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:57,340
were listening on the urine show he was here for that yeah excuse me

449
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:00,840
Uh, Mel wanted to share something about the tournament? I mean, float?

450
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,840
I'm just saying, if it was... whatever...

451
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:07,340
If it was a back-to-school tournament, why wouldn't they give away some cool prizes like some trapper keepers or like...

452
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:10,340
Yeah! DDR trapper keepers!

453
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:15,340
If it was a back-to-school tournament, why were they holding it on a school night?

454
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:21,340
No, no, no, no, the trapper keeper is bad news. I mean, we saw South Park, we know what can happen with trapper keepers.

455
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:25,340
Maybe they could give away... butterfly binders!

456
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:34,980
I was actually surprised at the turnout for a Tuesday night, I really was, but a bunch

457
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:38,380
of people I didn't know, and it was interesting.

458
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:41,160
Yeah, new faces I didn't even know as well, so.

459
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:47,060
So was the money raised from this thing to go towards making their marquee look non-ghetto?

460
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:53,900
Because their marquee is pretty crap, I mean, it looked like, you know, I'm gonna glue stuff

461
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:57,140
to a piece of wood, and it will be our marquee.

462
00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:00,620
Well, they're using the money to actually build the actual scandia place, like the

463
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:04,300
paths would be better, the speakers...

464
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:07,860
Maybe they cannot spend it on more skee-ball machines.

465
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:11,780
My god, they have like eight skee-ball machines in there in the

466
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:15,480
shooting gallery. Maybe they can use it to dismantle the damn

467
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,220
shooting gallery.

468
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:21,940
A shooting gallery is fun to annoy people. Dude, the shooting gallery sucks.

469
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:28,940
You know, my whole reason for going to Scandia, you know, had, had, you know, DVD drive failure, so...

470
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,940
They're sending it to Reno.

471
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,940
It's gone.

472
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:33,940
They sent it to Reno.

473
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:34,940
Damn it!

474
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:35,940
Damn it!

475
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:42,940
Alright, so we had the little tournament. I dropped in for about 45 minutes, and I was pissed off because they weren't doing freestyle, and I was going to do an exhibition freestyle.

476
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:47,940
Dr. Dick was going to come out and do Sexy Planet, but I got denied.

477
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:54,940
And I had my hoes and everything, and I had my uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh part all figured out.

478
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,940
Denied.

479
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:01,940
Stupid Scandia. I am a total dance attention whore when it comes to freestyle tournaments.

480
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,940
I can't wait for Spiggle 3, that's all I have to say.

481
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:07,940
They actually gave me some news towards the skit house that they're gonna do tournaments and stuff for Scandia.

482
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:10,940
They're thinking about doing it every month.

483
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,940
Yeah, I know, exactly.

484
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:16,940
The over-saturation's calling.

485
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:19,440
Anyway, anything else interesting happen to you this week?

486
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:25,440
I got a lot of contact from someone who has organized like Madden tournaments and various other video game tournaments.

487
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,440
The theme will get into the DDR scene as well.

488
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,940
Oh, okay.

489
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:31,440
Because you know DDR and Madden so much alike.

490
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,440
Yeah.

491
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,940
No, I'm teasing, but that's cool.

492
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:40,440
There's a tournament of Madden and Tuesday and Steve's Place Pizza in the marketplace.

493
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:45,140
There's been kind of an over I mean I'm sorry there's been a lack actually of like really like big

494
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:48,300
Tournaments lately in the past few months like big tournaments there

495
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:53,720
Haven't been a whole lot, but I kind of fear that this December is looking to be almost a little oversaturated

496
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:58,400
I mean I've heard of a lot of different things going on so just just be careful check out the calendar

497
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:04,640
We all know everybody's everybody that has an eye on DDR freaks tournament forum, so you know just check them out

498
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:11,640
Well, then you got, cause you got SVGL3, you got B3 part 2, I'm not sure when in the hell that's gonna turn out.

499
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:16,640
Oh. Okay, or, or FU2 on next year.

500
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,640
FU2!

501
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,640
FU2, buddy!

502
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,640
Alright.

503
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,640
The Sacktown Smackdown, that's the subtitle.

504
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:29,640
Oh, Jesus. Alright, alright. Anyway, anything else you want to share about your weekend any day?

505
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:35,400
except someone threw a damn beer bottle at my head

506
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,640
for what?

507
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,640
what'd you do?

508
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,120
what'd you do?

509
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:45,240
no, I didn't say anything, they thought I split the model

510
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:50,440
you were waving at somebody? hello! and they threw a beer bottle at you?

511
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:53,560
oh my gosh, yeah

512
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:56,720
my god people can be rude

513
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:01,640
Wait a second, he was driving and someone threw a beer bottle at him.

514
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:05,920
What's wrong with this picture?

515
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,260
I was like, woohoo!

516
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:12,680
Oh shit!

517
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:17,040
You lead a very interesting life, explicit, that's all I have to say.

518
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,600
Alright. Well, somewhat, yeah. Alright.

519
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,880
Moving on, let's talk about my week and my day, shall we?

520
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:28,880
My week of my day was pretty good. I had to say I had a lot of fun at the Qsar thing last night.

521
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:33,880
Matt and I actually played on the same team for one game, and I was the top gun, thank you very much.

522
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:38,880
Now, of course, he was spinning around and just blindly shooting things and fucking around, but hey, doesn't matter.

523
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:49,880
And of course, in that game where it was me, Loki's girlfriend, and DDRHolic all playing in one game, versus Loki, he schooled us by like 200 points, but hey, we tried.

524
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:55,280
Anyway, I had a lot of fun, and I actually played a game of DDR, believe it or not.

525
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,560
I played a game of Extreme, and this was my set on DDR Extreme, okay?

526
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:07,160
I played I Believe in Miracles, and Make It Better from DDR First Mix, and then I played

527
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,160
another Second Mix song.

528
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,140
I think I played, like, Let's Get Down or something.

529
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:12,880
I made it an all Second Mix and First Mix night.

530
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,220
It was awesome.

531
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:19,820
I miss my old DDR mixes, anyway.

532
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:23,380
Also tonight, I don't know if you caught a glimpse of me on the webcam earlier, but I'm

533
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:28,300
dressed in all black, because I'm going out to a goth club after the show.

534
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,500
That should be fun.

535
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,500
You goth.

536
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:33,260
Yes, you know, I'm so gothic.

537
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:35,260
That's so wrong.

538
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:39,500
This is pretty much what it's going to sound like at the goth club, you know, like, oh

539
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:42,980
wow, the lights.

540
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:49,980
I'm so tragic. I need another clove, cigarettes.

541
00:40:56,420 --> 00:41:00,140
I'm just teasing. I'm just, I'm just hoping that somebody I know is listening to that

542
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:03,340
so he'll kick my ass when, you know, I go out later. Anyway.

543
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:07,420
I, I, I didn't... I, I...

544
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:11,580
Okay. You know where I'm from

545
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:15,560
And you know that damn near everybody I hung out with was like uber goth, right?

546
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:20,700
You know, but I never imagined that there would be like a a club

547
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:28,180
What did you do go around and just be depressed and wave your hands around like you're trying to bat the ghosts away from you

548
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:32,060
I'm so gothic that when the night comes

549
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,940
So do I

550
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:39,100
They fucking play industrial and like

551
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:45,800
was industrial synthpop that kind of stuff it's really good stuff I actually

552
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:52,160
like the music at that I went once and then I got I was with one of my friends

553
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:57,320
who's like in this goth stuff and this one guy wanted to take me home and have

554
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:02,800
sex and he was like and he was dressed up and like like it and some sort of

555
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:07,520
like I don't know it was just wrong and again I don't know how many times I've

556
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:12,680
had to apologize for that Loki I'm sorry to do that to you but I just don't if

557
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:17,360
your life is so tragic why would you dance about it you know what it no in

558
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:21,280
reality it's actually a lot of fun if if I if I didn't enjoy it I wouldn't pay a

559
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,800
whole four dollars to get in the door so I'm looking forward to it because I

560
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,440
actually haven't been in like two years and there's a lot of fun people to go

561
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:34,960
it's all about the people all right um moving on we're gonna go to a break but

562
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:39,640
I wanted to talk to you guys about something before we go to the break. I

563
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:43,480
think Floatwalk wants to talk to you guys about something too. About a little

564
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:46,280
something, a little bit that's been confusing to some of you guys out there.

565
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:55,240
Can we get Floatwalk a mic? Now those of you guys that visit DDR Freak have seen this

566
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:59,560
picture of a of a bagel and you don't know what it means. It means something

567
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:02,200
but you don't know what it means. Well we're gonna give you a little bit of

568
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:11,760
help. And Floatwalk has gotten a clue relayed to him from Dancer X, the mysterious Dancer

569
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:16,920
X, but you know, Floatwalk talks to him, so you're special. And so we've gotten some things

570
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:21,760
here, so maybe just these first two bits here we'll give away for right now.

571
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:27,640
Okay, well it's pretty obvious so far no one has answered the question correct yet, although

572
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:31,920
I will say, I have seen some very close answers on there.

573
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:36,320
And as I mentioned before, a lot of people are trying to, I

574
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:39,120
guess, sort of think that the song is three steps away from

575
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,400
what you literally see.

576
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,680
Well, it's actually right there.

577
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,920
It's a little more literal than you think.

578
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:50,480
But also, if you read DancerX's post, he said in

579
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,440
there that it is a new song.

580
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:55,120
It's something that has never been on DDR before.

581
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:58,880
so that should narrow down some of the ideas that you had

582
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:03,320
and do you think we should go ahead and give him the new clue yet?

583
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:06,440
let's wait a little bit let's see if that new song thing helps him out a little bit

584
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:11,120
so it's a brand new song and you guys it was actually in his original post

585
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:14,680
it was like the subject line and you guys completely missed it but hey you know

586
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:17,760
what can you do we can only hold your hand so far

587
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:22,520
but if you have some guesses we'll be fielding guesses over private message a

588
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:23,120
little later

589
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:25,680
Don't just shout it out in the chat room, because we're not paying attention.

590
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:29,000
No, actually, we are paying attention, but we don't want to miss it.

591
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,480
So that's why we like to field the guesses over a private message.

592
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:35,600
So after the break, we'll take some more guesses and have a look.

593
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:39,520
And I'll even put it like this, if someone can guess it just from the clues that I've

594
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:44,320
given you, if you somehow pull it out, I will guarantee you some cool Konami swag.

595
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,320
Ooh, swag!

596
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,320
Speaking of swag.

597
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,320
Can I guess?

598
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:52,200
Oh, we have a huge announcement on swag coming up for Orange Lounge later.

599
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,520
You will not want to miss this one.

600
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:56,800
Floatwalk's going to talk to us about this.

601
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,880
This is very exciting news for Orange Lounge Radio.

602
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,320
Floatwalk's going to tell us all about it right after the break.

603
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:03,400
And in this break, we're going to have three songs

604
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,840
that all have a central theme.

605
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:06,200
You try and figure out what it is.

606
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:06,680
We'll be back.

607
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:32,740
I'm gonna show you how to burn

608
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:34,740
show you how to burn

609
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:11,740
It's time to burn

610
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:14,740
Burn, burn, burn, you burn me

611
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:16,740
Your mind is talking so loud

612
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:18,740
You burn me

613
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:20,740
There's an expectation

614
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:22,740
Our bodies are flashing inside

615
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:24,740
I'm on fire

616
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,740
Burn, burn, burn, you're fired

617
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:28,740
Can't I thank you more?

618
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:32,740
Don't shoot me, I'll fire you with me crazy

619
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:37,740
I'm down to find the force, find the force, find the force

620
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:14,180
Like a greedy man, I'm comin' back to you It's time to play my game, I can't do without

It's a burning desire

629
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:52,180
Fighting me seeks my heart and my soul

630
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:53,180

And it drives me crazy

634
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:03,180
It's that burning desire

635

Riding me seeks my heart and soul

To make your sky more than blue

643

As I'm going my way

00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:21,580
Get me up inside

00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:40,580
I burn every time that I'm close to you

650
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:44,580
I burn it up for you

651
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:47,580
I burn it up for you

652
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:55,580
I never loved anybody the way I do

653
00:49:55,580 --> 00:50:13,580
I believe one day we'll find the key to leaving

654
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:35,780
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

655
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:38,380
We are back, Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 110.

656
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:44,220
Okay, we told you before the break that the clue has something to do with a new song,

657
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:48,940
so here's your chance to give it another guess, send a private message to Sky in the chat

658
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:50,300
room with your guess.

659
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:54,720
If you get it right, you get to be the one to announce it, ooh la la, and you could even

660
00:50:54,720 --> 00:51:00,900
do that over the skype line if you have access to that our skype line just go to www.orangelaungeradio.com

661
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:04,960
click on interact with us and get the information about the skype line so we're looking for

662
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:14,780
your guesses meanwhile before we went to the break float walk and i were teasing a little

663
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:18,960
something that's coming up for orange lounge radio and float walk why don't you tell us

664
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,280
a little more about what's going on i thought we had a third mic somewhere we can get for

665
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:32,240
Jamie maybe maybe not I don't know anyway the giveaway that's coming up oh

666
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:37,200
yes yes well okay um as I've seen in our challenge I know there are a couple

667
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:43,320
people that we hold in high regard in this realm of Bemani and such people who

668
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:47,840
we'd like to sleep with is this list we have no I'm kidding and atop that list

669
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:51,760
which I think holds true for quite a bunch of people you know figuratively

670
00:51:51,760 --> 00:52:02,760
and conceptually or reality. We do have someone who has decided to donate us some swag, autographed swag, no less.

671
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:05,760
And that person would be... Drumroll, anyone?

672
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:06,760
Yeah.

673
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:13,760
Okay, we got clap on the clapper. But that'll do. And that person is...

674
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:15,760
Akira Yomoka.

675
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:26,120
Yes indeed, when DDR Spot did the interview with Kiryamoka a couple of weeks ago when

676
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:31,320
we posted it on DDR Spot, he mentioned somewhere in the email that he would be willing to give

677
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:37,540
out some swag to our listeners and to our readers at DDR Spot and given the business

678
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:42,720
relations between DDR Spot and Orange Lounge, I figured why not share the wealth with everybody.

679
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:46,800
So, we do have a handful of CDs to give away.

680
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:49,360
How we will do that, we are still determining right now,

681
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:52,240
but you will have to listen to not just Orange Lounge Radio

682
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,760
on Sunday nights, but I think there's a little more

683
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:56,760
attention you'll have to be paying.

684
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:58,920
Yes, we're cooking up a scheme right now

685
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,160
on how we're gonna give away the CDs,

686
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,800
but we are very excited to be working with DDR Spot

687
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,680
on this exciting giveaway.

688
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:07,080
Ooh, I know a lot of people out there want those CDs,

689
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:08,820
so we're gonna make it tough,

690
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:10,920
but the prize is gonna be well worth it,

691
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:12,560
so look forward to that.

692
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:17,480
some giveaways, a little piece of a Kiryamoka for your bedroom or wherever you decide to

693
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:18,480
put it.

694
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:21,520
Yes, and DDR Spot as well will be giving them out.

695
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:26,120
We're actually going to be redoing our interface in the next couple weeks, so probably expect

696
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:30,840
by around the end of the month, we'll have a new relaunch, and this time, the reason

697
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:34,720
why I think we're going to be a little more successful is we actually have more staff

698
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:37,300
helping us out.

699
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:38,300
More staff?

700
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:39,300
Har, har.

701
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:42,540
Har har. Who'd be sucker enough to help you guys out?

702
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:49,440
People who like something different. I mean, I'll say this as far as like DDR spot one thing I do

703
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:54,840
Like to pump up about us is the fact that any kind of Konami news that breaks

704
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:59,620
About the from the u.s. Side of things. I mean, no one's going to beat us to the punch

705
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:07,400
How the people who are on spot staff work, you know there is that is that difficult having to have a DDR fan site?

706
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:15,400
yet at the same time you work for Konami. If you wanted to blow the lid on the whole UltraMix 2 song list and the Extreme Unlocks and all that stuff, you could do it.

707
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:16,400
Oh yeah, we absolutely could.

708
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,400
I mean, you could get sued, but you could do it.

709
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:25,400
You could do it, but at the same time, there's, you know, movies that you geek up over. You don't want someone to tell you, like, how it ends. You know, word for word verbatim.

710
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:29,400
Yeah, you know what? The boat sank, and, uh, Darth is Luke's father. Sorry, guys.

711
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:34,400
Yeah, essentially. I mean, just working for a while, it's like, I mean...

712
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:35,400
And Jesus does die.

713
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,400
At the end, they hang Jesus.

714
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:41,400
Yeah, I mean, I think the best way of putting it...

715
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:44,400
Wow, Jesus dies and laughter ensued.

716
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:49,400
Sorry for the spoiler guy, but Jesus does die at the end of that recent DVD release.

717
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:57,400
Oh yeah, but the thing about, I guess, working there, like, the first day, obviously, you're surprised just as anybody to find out, you know, this news,

718
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:04,400
but then, once you start playing something for 40 hours a week, the novelty dies out after the 15th hour, so...

719
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:15,400
But I think we've gotten to the point where it's something, I mean, it's something we've all done before, it's pretty standard nature to understand the nature of the beast, how people are on boards.

720
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:29,400
I mean, obviously they're going to pester you for a clue here or there, but now that I work closer with the product managers and all the PR people, I kind of know where my limits are, and once those are drawn out, it's easy to hold on to those, stay within those boundaries.

721
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:36,200
So speaking of limits, any other hints about things we could look forward to?

722
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:38,960
I'm trying guys, I'm trying to get something out of them.

723
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:46,120
I will say for UltraMix 2 SP7 will be ready when UltraMix 2 ships.

724
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:47,120
Right on?

725
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:53,960
Yeah, well we know it is and there's new stuff on there, so you're not just getting run-of-the-mill

726
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:56,800
things.

727
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:00,800
The Xbox Live is going to be pretty awesome. It's going to be more robust this time on

728
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:04,800
Iron. You've probably heard, obviously, you can trade edits online, you can download

729
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:05,800
step data.

730
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:08,240
Awesome. Have they made an official announcement, you don't have to say it one way or the other,

731
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:11,120
but have they made an official announcement about being able to play those edits? I know

732
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:15,000
there was a little bit of confusion about being able to play edits.

733
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,800
To, like, challenge someone online with the edits?

734
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:17,800
Yeah, with playing edits.

735
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:22,440
Quite honestly, I can't remember. I mean, there's so many things that go into, you know,

736
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:23,440
like...

737
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:24,440
All right, all right. It's cool.

738
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:25,440
It just slips me.

739
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:26,440
It's cool, it's cool.

740
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:29,440
I don't want you to say anything that's going to get you in trouble, so don't worry about it.

741
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:34,440
What else do I expect? A lot of people geeked up over DDR Extreme having a v-rare.

742
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:41,440
I will say there's a high chance, not 100% sure, but there's a high chance we'll have a v-rare number 4.

743
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,440
Ooh, okay.

744
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:44,440
You heard that here first.

745
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:46,440
A v-rare number 4?

746
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:47,440
Possibly.

747
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,440
How would that... okay, alright.

748
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,440
I think I see where this might be going.

749
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:54,440
Alright, we'll leave it to our listeners to figure that one out.

750
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:58,440
Maybe. Maybe.

751
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:02,440
Other than that, Ultramix 2 is looking snazzy

752
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:06,440
right now. We're almost ready to send it off to Microsoft

753
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:10,440
and just let them give us the good word.

754
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:14,440
Now, I don't know if you can repeat any of this, but you were telling me some funny stories about working on Microsoft

755
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:18,440
earlier. I don't know if that's something you've got to keep on the down low.

756
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:22,440
No, actually, it's kind of fascinating. I mean, anyone who works in video games

757
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:27,880
and does stuff with like Microsoft or Sony, there's actually standards you have to follow.

758
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:33,400
Like one thing is things on the PlayStation controller for example, you know those little

759
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:37,240
analog sticks you have on the sides, you know in the front of the controller? They actually,

760
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:41,320
like any time they're referred to in a game, they actually have to be called right analog

761
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:45,120
stick or left analog stick, you can't call them anything else, or you can call them L3,

762
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:50,040
R3. But if you say like, yeah, in the instruction book, use the thumb stick, you would actually

763
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:54,060
get zinged for it. And what exactly is a zing? Does that mean they come out and kick your

764
00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:58,940
ass or find you? They'll say we're not going to ship your game. Oh my god! There are some

765
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:02,560
things they'll let slide but there are some things they're pretty strict about and like

766
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:07,260
just how you name your stuff is actually a big deal. Well not big deal but a semi. Wow.

767
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:11,420
That's crazy. Yeah. I mean it's when you work in QA and video games there are things you

768
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:15,980
have to test like you have to make sure your game can run 72 hours without crashing. You

769
00:58:15,980 --> 00:58:18,900
know? Oh my gosh. There are things you have to do like you have to pull the controller.

770
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:22,900
How did Driver 3 get through QA? That's what I want to know.

771
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:25,900
Yeah, you didn't go through Konami. That's for damn sure.

772
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:32,900
But yeah, it's an interesting beast. A lot of people think when you're in QA you have to play games.

773
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:37,900
You know, you just played Ad Nauseam, but you're supposed to sit there and you're supposed to break what you can.

774
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:43,900
So anyone who's trying to get into the game industry, you gotta learn how to break games. Not how to play them, break them.

775
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:49,180
break them. Wow, that's good. Yeah, Loki's very good at breaking games, I must say.

776
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:54,860
And I broke Ultramix last night. I don't know, I was telling you this earlier, I actually broke Ultramix, so

777
00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:58,460
something got through the cracks somehow, I don't know, but. Well, Ultramix

778
00:58:58,460 --> 00:59:02,420
was a half-rush job, but I mean,

779
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:08,420
like any other game in the series, the first will always have flaws, which is why you come out with the sequel to correct.

780
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:12,340
And it wasn't, it honestly wasn't a big deal. I found it more amusing than anything else.

781
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:13,620
It didn't piss me off or anything.

782
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:16,660
Besides, flaws in Microsoft products is nothing new.

783
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:20,060
Hahahaha.

784
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:25,180
Service pack 2, anybody?

785
00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:29,540
What else? Yeah, I mean, most people know that a lot of the

786
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:35,160
step data for new songs has been done by Konami QA. I think people who...

787
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:38,960
there's, you know, usually two people, people who like fun songs and people who like challenging songs,

788
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:41,620
I think they're going to get a good variety of both.

789
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:46,500
I'm very excited about Ultramix too. But something we haven't talked a whole lot about, DR Extreme,

790
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:51,540
it's just about out, it's almost there. I gotta say, because we were talking about this last week,

791
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:55,460
we were kind of like talking about the whole GameStop leaking the song list, some of the song

792
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:59,700
list unlocks early and stuff, we were like, boy, Konami must be really pissed off at what happened.

793
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:04,820
Was there a little bit of frustration from the clue givers and things like that about the GameStop

794
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:09,220
article, or? Kind of sort of, yeah, actually. I mean, you know, I was talking to- I'm sorry,

795
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:11,620
I'm sorry, not GameStop, GamePro. My bad. My bad.

796
01:00:11,620 --> 01:00:17,220
Um, yeah, um, Jason Needles was actually kind of, uh, I would say mad, but he was definitely surprised that

797
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:23,620
they would just blow out a whole bunch of, uh, screen caps that more or less gave away a lot of the secrets.

798
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:28,220
And I don't think necessarily it was intentional, it was just kind of like, somebody just wasn't thinking.

799
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:32,620
They were just grabbing screenshots and not thinking about, oh, maybe somebody's trying to keep the unlocked stuff a secret.

800
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:39,120
Yeah, well, I mean, I actually saw, like, what a press kit, you know, there's, essentially there are different types of versions.

801
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:42,340
you get of a game, like for example, they got what's called a media version, kind of

802
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:46,300
like when a place that, you know, has movies, they get screeners and all that kind of stuff.

803
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:47,300
Right.

804
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:48,300
I don't know anything about that.

805
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:49,300
Yeah, well, he doesn't know anything about screeners.

806
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:52,600
So essentially, what that happened was, when you get this screener, you get practically

807
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:57,660
most of everything unlocked already, so they can just kind of review the whole game because,

808
01:00:57,660 --> 01:01:01,780
I mean, there are some, when you get a game review or something, you kind of want to know

809
01:01:01,780 --> 01:01:04,940
how it ends and all that stuff, so you could say, yeah, this game is great, but man, the

810
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:05,940
ending sucked.

811
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:09,100
You know, I mean, they may not tell you explicitly what happens, but, you know, they didn't want

812
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:12,140
want to kind of play through it and you know so they can formulate a great

813
01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:16,300
opinion. Now I would think stuff like You're Not Here and Maximizer and stuff

814
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:18,860
you guys are really trying probably trying to keep under under the lid a

815
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:22,220
little bit and then it just kind of got blown out I mean You're Not Here was a

816
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:26,860
little bit spoiled by the dancing stage fever song or I mean fusion

817
01:01:26,860 --> 01:01:31,300
song list so it was kind of like you know man there's a good chance that

818
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:34,060
people were kind of thinking okay yeah that probably would be an unlock but

819
01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:40,560
Maximizer that was even though you can go back to the whole reading the master

820
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:44,400
song list thing and Maximizer had turned up there before this is really the

821
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:48,560
concrete confirmation people were looking for and yes there is on there

822
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:56,720
it's basically to put it it's America's own version of max I don't know whether

823
01:01:56,720 --> 01:02:01,160
it be excited or scared no I actually I mean a lot of people look at that they

824
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:04,460
say oh it's an eight-footer gosh you know that's like a big letdown but I

825
01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:09,160
there was a guy who know Pacquiao and Kenobi who's you know pretty well known

826
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:12,800
in the DDR community you know on DDR freak and he was not able to full combo

827
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:19,080
that I I have to say I am actually glad it's not a 10-footer because honestly I

828
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:22,400
can't play 10 footers at home I can mean I can barely blame the arcade as it is

829
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:26,600
but the home versions aren't meant to be 10 footers yeah exactly I mean I just

830
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:30,600
You're playing on those freaking ignition pads, you know?

831
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:34,600
Yeah, that's true. But I will say, Maximizer really sounds cool.

832
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:38,600
I think of the Maxes, I actually like the way that sounds the best.

833
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:42,600
As like Dancer X talked about, it's sort of like

834
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:46,600
has a very, very gabba sound to it.

835
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:48,600
Gabba, gabba, gabba, gabba, gabba. Yeah.

836
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:50,600
Alright. Very interesting. Alright.

837
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:29,440
We will, we here at Orange

838
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:54,600
will play that song for you as soon as we can.

839
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:57,460
We have to, you know, probably rip it from the game first, but as soon as we can we will

840
01:02:57,460 --> 01:02:59,720
get it for you guys so you guys can hear it.

841
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:02,820
As well as any other surprises that are still in store.

842
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:05,900
Are there still surprises in store for DDR Extreme?

843
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:06,900
Absolutely.

844
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:07,900
Alright.

845
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:09,620
We'll leave it on that note.

846
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:10,620
I'm looking for it.

847
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:11,620
I am looking...

848
01:03:11,620 --> 01:03:12,620
It is not a clue.

849
01:03:12,620 --> 01:03:17,060
Yeah, absolutely is not a clue.

850
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:19,060
Oh my God.

851
01:03:19,060 --> 01:03:24,140
Wow, so, gosh, I'm out of questions for Mel.

852
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:28,140
Does anybody else have anything to say about this whole extreme and Ultimix 2 we've been talking about?

853
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:30,140
Loki, Dark Sakura?

854
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:32,140
It's your show too, dammit.

855
01:03:32,140 --> 01:03:34,140
Oh, Lanky Style's here with Rice Princess.

856
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:37,140
Yeah, I just want to know, Mel B., how do you stay so sexy?

857
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:39,140
Easy for me.

858
01:03:39,140 --> 01:03:41,140
Bloat walk, not Mel B.

859
01:03:41,140 --> 01:03:47,140
I'd say do about 50 push-ups a day and one pack of pork rinds.

860
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:50,140
Awesome.

861
01:03:50,140 --> 01:04:01,140
I guess I'll open up the Skypline in a little bit for those folks that may have a question or something about UltraMix 2 or DDR Extreme. I swear I'll hang up on you if it's something else.

862
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:05,140
So let's see, we'll go to the Skypline and see if anybody has anything they want to say.

863
01:04:05,140 --> 01:04:11,140
Oh, I just missed that call, my bad. We'll see if anybody calls back. Over on the Skypline.

864
01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:15,140
Ah, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

865
01:04:15,140 --> 01:04:17,140
Hello?

866
01:04:17,140 --> 01:04:19,140
Hello?

867
01:04:19,140 --> 01:04:23,140
We can not hear you. Can you turn up your microphone volume or something?

868
01:04:23,140 --> 01:04:26,140
Is this better?

869
01:04:26,140 --> 01:04:27,140
A little bit.

870
01:04:27,140 --> 01:04:28,140
Is this better now?

871
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:30,140
A little bit. How you doing?

872
01:04:30,140 --> 01:04:35,140
Alright, I missed all the UltraMix II things. Can you fill me in?

873
01:04:35,140 --> 01:04:39,140
You missed everything on UltraMix II?

874
01:04:39,140 --> 01:04:45,140
Well, I only managed to pick up the other half, but I just came in and...

875
01:04:45,140 --> 01:04:48,140
Shame on you for being tardy to the show.

876
01:04:48,140 --> 01:04:53,480
on you you had to clean your you could clean your room while listening to the

877
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:59,240
show I don't buy that excuse all right all right it's gonna be on a disc

878
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:05,000
ultramix to Xbox the Xbox live portion is gonna be bigger there's a clue still

879
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:09,800
involving the bagel out there and if it's for a new song and ultramix 2 is

880
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:15,080
gonna have a variety of different kinds of music and what else folks that are

881
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:18,880
into DDR are doing the steps we know that much and there's going to be a mix

882
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:20,440
of challenging versus fun

883
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:23,720
and who are these people they're actually doing

884
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:26,880
are these people well-known? can we

885
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:29,800
give any more information about the people doing the steps I guess not

886
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:30,280
really

887
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:34,280
can we give names? I don't think we can give names

888
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:37,720
I can't necessarily name drop I mean I'm sure it wouldn't make a hell of a difference but that said

889
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:41,880
the people who are in QA are actually... wait we can't hear you exactly let Mel finish

890
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:48,880
They are accomplished GDR players, there are people who have won tournaments, there are people who not only PA'd, there are people who freestyle.

891
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:57,880
So they take into account like, you know, for basic steps for example, you often want steps that are pretty easy and like freestylable, so we take that into account.

892
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:06,880
We take into account that, you know, for maniac steps, there are people who are total difficulty whores, and you know, we do stuff that is ergonomically doable.

893
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:12,960
I mean, we're not going to do something that's like we strive for 11 feet, you know, because there's such thing

894
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:16,720
You need to have as like game balancing and such. So it's you know, we're like that

895
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:21,540
We're trying to find moderation, you know balance in other words in other words that goo just go pre-order it tomorrow

896
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:23,800
Word but yeah one more thing

897
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:29,480
Okay, only focused on one half of the country or is it all you know all over for these players?

898
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:35,320
The certain players is it only one part of the country in other words are all these players coming from NorCal

899
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:45,320
Well, let's put it like this. It's based in Redwood City, so it's not like we just sat out there and we had this big audition.

900
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:51,320
Anyone could apply to Konami, but they had to go through the whole interview process.

901
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:54,320
They had to go through people like me who have worked there for a year.

902
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:59,320
I have to gauge their acumen on how well they play the game, what they think makes the game well.

903
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:02,320
I mean, yeah, most of us are based in Northern California.

904
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:04,320
But not 100%?

905
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:09,280
no not hurt there are some people who have been imported so uh...

906
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:11,360
it's it's not as uh... all

907
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:15,120
concentric imported from different places that's all we can tell you but

908
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:16,840
all right how about this

909
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:19,920
anything anything new about that anything that we know about the song list

910
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:23,000
is already up on the site we don't have any new info tonight though

911
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,960
not yet we may have one more song for the night's over

912
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:27,200
it's up to you guys

913
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:29,040
are the song packs going to be better

914
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:31,600
are the song packs going to be better

915
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:37,600
That's an opinion. Like I mentioned about SP7, there is new stuff on there.

916
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:39,600
I'll answer it, yes.

917
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:43,600
Wait, the new stuff for Ultramix is coming out already?

918
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:47,600
Service Pack 7 will be out the day that Ultramix 2 is out.

919
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:51,600
And which one, do we have the names of the songs yet?

920
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:54,600
Not yet. Not yet bud, we'll have them soon.

921
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:58,600
Alright, thanks for your questions. It was engaging and fun.

922
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:00,600
Bye bye.

923
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:07,060
Alright, let's see if anybody else wants to call in questions about Ultramix 2 or DDR extreme in the meantime

924
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:11,560
Let's go let's go over some of these clues

925
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:14,680
We got some people that guessed some of the songs that were in the game

926
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:17,300
And now we're gonna let you know if anybody was right

927
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:24,360
So, let's see. We had Seagurd put in a guess, but unfortunately, he's not allowed to participate because he was right

928
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:30,360
But I will say Sigurd was right on his guess. Good for him.

929
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:32,360
He better be right, man.

930
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:38,360
Jazz said the sweetest thing by some band whose name I have no idea. I'm thinking maybe U2?

931
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:40,360
Now he's thinking too abstract.

932
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:43,360
No. That was a decent guess, though. That was decent.

933
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:50,360
I think that's the one thing I like about this whole thread thing, is you really get to see how people think.

934
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:58,080
You know, it's like, they'll come up with the strangest word associations, and like, they'll try to go three steps, because this, this, and this, I think it's this song.

935
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:01,680
I mean, it makes for great reading material and sure kills time at work.

936
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:07,680
Alright, uh, White Rob has a guess. Pam Baker and the Blue Plate Special, with Bacon the Blues.

937
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:10,400
Very interesting.

938
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:14,200
Very- he says, the plate was blue, and the bagel is baked.

939
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:18,440
You can't get more obvious than that. But unfortunately it's not it.

940
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:20,000
Yeah. No dice.

941
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Bummer.

942
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:27,000
E.B. Sumaru says, John Desire with Hot Limit.

943
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Maybe because the bagel's hot? I don't know.

944
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:34,000
But, nah, I don't know.

945
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Sorry bud, doesn't work.

946
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Alright, so those are the guesses we got so far, so we'll just have to see if anything else comes in later.

947
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Mel was talking about a V-Rare that is coming out for DDR Extreme, and that song list was leaked to the internet this week.

948
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:52,000
It sounds like some retailers are getting their copies.

949
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,000
There was a scan of the back cover and everything.

950
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,000
It's out there now, so we gotta tell you what's on it.

951
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Well, damn.

952
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Here's another one of those things where they beat you to it, didn't they?

953
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
There's only so much you can do.

954
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:10,000
We held up our end of the bargain.

955
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
We can't handle what the retailers do.

956
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
That's right. Yeah, the retailers leaked it.

957
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,000
People like the VRare list, and you know, hey, all is good in the end.

958
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Track number one is Scorching Moon by Sean the Horny Master, which did not get censored. People thought it would be censored to just the master or...

959
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Well, what's the censor? The dude plays horns.

960
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Exactly.

961
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:37,000
I mean, not anymore, you know. I still have like a little sadness in my heart for the fact show T's no longer in Konami.

962
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:46,560
number two a by DJ amuro is the second track on the CD track number three is

963
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:52,120
ecstasy by D complex track number four is your rain the rage mix yay kiri almoca

01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:55,600
featuring Mary Elizabeth McGlynn the track we premiered for you last month

965
01:10:55,600 --> 01:11:01,080
wild rush factor X is track number five track number six is the departed show T

966
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:05,440
with a stupid barber a track seven mobile mocha by our favorite orange

967
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:11,840

01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:18,960
three two one stars by DJ Simon track 10 V for extreme by DJ Taka and here are

969
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:24,440
the bonus tracks eleven is I need you the inside door three mixes never heard

970
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:29,320
of that one before um actually that was uh yeah party collection of you rare

971
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:33,320
also I don't know actually door one of the viewers that came on Japan had yeah

972
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:39,320
Yeah, it's like, it has all three mixes, like, all kind of fused together, just fused up with the Inside Out and All That, I think.

973
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:43,320
No, it's just the Inside Out and All That mix, they have the three or...

974
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:44,320
Oh, okay.

975
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:53,320
Also on the Party Collection OST.

976
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:59,080
Party Collection OST? I didn't know that. 13 is B4U Glorious Style. That would be the

977
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:04,240
long version from DER 5th Mix. You guys trying to hint at something there? Maybe? Maybe.

978
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:14,000
Maybe not. Track 14 is So In Love, the train version by Caramel S and the Master. And track

979
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:21,560
number 15 is I Need You, the True Platinum Mix by ShowTee. And that's the V-Rare. Actually,

980
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:25,300
While it's still on my mind, one thing I'd like to point out also for anyone who's a

981
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:30,200
fan of Konami artists and like the Bimani musicians, one of the games that's coming

982
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:36,860
out this fall, Rumble Roses for PS2, the all-female wrestling game, you know, high, best things

983
01:12:36,860 --> 01:12:38,880
ever made.

984
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:46,320
A lot of the Bimani musicians did compose music for that, like DJ Taka did a track there,

985
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:51,480
which was called Sota Fujimori did stuff there, yeah, let's see, who else?

986
01:12:51,480 --> 01:13:00,680
The guy who did Jet World, he did something, Dez Road did a track on there, so yeah, it's

987
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:04,680
actually funny enough, they were called, they were commissioned somewhere at the last minute

988
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:08,560
to do music for the game, and from what I've heard, it sounds pretty cool.

989
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:10,800
Nice, I can't wait to see it.

990
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:14,480
So definitely, if you're a Bomani music fan, you're going to have to pick up Rumble Roses.

991
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:17,360
But of course, as soon as we can get our hands on a soundtrack, we'll play some tracks for

992
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:18,360
you.

993
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:21,320
Kuriyamaoka did tracks on there as well.

994
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:24,040
Gosh, thank you, Sigurd.

995
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:25,040
Awesome.

996
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:26,040
Alright.

997
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:33,680
The other night, a bunch of us were at Lions, and it was like a dance GameStop people, and

998
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:38,440
they were there discussing on how they were looking forward to the realistic physics engine

999
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:46,920
of Rumble Roses, and the invigorating mud effects, and it was a funny conversation that

1000
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:51,320
it was yeah talking about how they were going to admire the aesthetic qualities

1001
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:54,400
of rumble roses and and yeah we did we did talk about this a couple weeks ago

1002
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:57,120
chat room but I didn't know about the desero thing there was there's more

1003
01:13:57,120 --> 01:14:00,320
artists in there than we originally thought I knew Akira and I knew some of

1004
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:03,040
them but I didn't know like desero there's way more people than I thought

1005
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:07,840
that's pretty cool any chance we might see some rumble roses songs on DER

1006
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:14,920
complete with some new characters as I do my little bounce thing all right

1007
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:19,840
question from explicit here in the house how many polygons are in each breast and

1008
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:29,640
rubber roses more than a handful on that note on that note I think we'll go to a

1009
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:35,280
break and to make up for float walks grotesque error earlier we will be

1010
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:40,200
playing an entire block of a kyriamoka music all right including some requests

1011
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:43,800
we had some requests so uh we will go to this what you know what do you want to

1012
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:47,800
Should we do that other clue? Should we do the other clue, Floatwok?

1013
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:48,800
Um, why not, sir?

1014
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:51,800
Why not? Hell, Floatwok, let's give him another chance.

1015
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:55,800
Let's give him another chance, Floatwok.

1016
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:57,800
While we have to pull up Dancer X's clue over here.

1017
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:00,800
I've got Dancer X's clue right up here.

1018
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,800
Really? Let me peek.

1019
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:10,800
Okay, clue, colon, a unique aspect of a type of cells in the body.

1020
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:17,300
Hmm. Hmm. A unique aspect of a type of cells in the body.

1021
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:26,100
So, uh, those of you who took physiology in high school, time to dust off your books and your brains and you just might find something.

1022
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:33,100
have fun boys and girls will be back

1023
01:15:56,100 --> 01:16:10,100
I cry out of my head And I don't know what I've found

1024
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:20,100
Over and over I feel it break me down

1025
01:16:20,100 --> 01:16:30,100
I'm waiting for a gentle rain, a gentle rain, a gentle rain

1026
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:35,100
On the sidewalk of the city, on the streets just for a whisper

1027
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:40,100
Busy people going nowhere, see me soaking my rain

1028
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:45,100
Nothing for passion, nothing matters, my resistance is waning

1029
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:54,100
Like a flower in the basement, waitin' for a long time

1030
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:29,100
Your gun is on me

1031
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:34,100
I'm not the one that's on me

1032
01:19:36,100 --> 01:19:42,100
You are too deep and dry

1033
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:48,100
I'm not the one that's on me

1034
01:20:48,100 --> 01:21:02,540
Orange Lounge Radio.

1035
01:21:02,540 --> 01:21:09,940
We put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.

1036
01:21:09,940 --> 01:21:10,940
We are back.

1037
01:21:10,940 --> 01:21:16,600
Orange Lounge Radio Season 5 has just started and in case you missed it, a unique aspect

1038
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:22,100
of a type of cells in the body. It's time to guess one more time. Send it in over private

1039
01:21:22,100 --> 01:21:29,980
message to Sky in the chat room if you have a guess. All right, moving on. I thought we'd

1040
01:21:29,980 --> 01:21:34,080
talk about other stuff. Let's see. Oh, by the way, there's drinking going on in the

1041
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:37,440
house tonight. It is the three-day weekend, which is traditionally an Orange Challenge

1042
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:42,680
Radio Drunk show. However, DarkSakura, you can't participate tonight because you drove,

1043
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:18,760
ice cream booze. Oh my god. I've actually sort of, I had this creme brulee

1044
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:25,720
liqueur that was really good. So I decided how to cheat. I decided that

1045
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:28,680
tomorrow is going to be my cheat day. So when it hits midnight I'm having some

1046
01:22:28,680 --> 01:22:32,120
Guinness at home. There you go. That's the spirit. I'm gonna finish off the Guinness

1047
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:37,200
in my fridge and have some amaretto. All right. Any special plans for Labor Day?

1048
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:43,560
sleeping. Sounds good to me. Actually you know I'm like I'm gonna do my homework

1049
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:47,200
tomorrow I'm going over to Julie's where there's air conditioning, air conditioning

1050
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:52,880
Wow and I'm gonna do my laundry cuz see look what I did not bring over tonight

1051
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:57,600
laundry with my laundry. Impressive. So I'm doing my laundry at Julie's tomorrow and

1052
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:02,560
making use of one of her five computers that she built. Sounds good

1053
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:11,920
yes Loki no okay no I'm actually working on right now building my own laptop like

1054
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:16,120
actually it's not really a laptop I'm gonna be putting inside of a case of a

1055
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:20,640
Dreamcast and be a portable PC with its own LCD monitor which will also double

1056
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:26,000
as a car PC with its own navigational and GPS system and will be an on-road

1057
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:31,120
computer for our show well you know the Dreamcast uses Windows CE well I'm

1058
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:33,120
I'm actually gutting it, I'm just using the case.

1059
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:35,120
Oh, like the Nintendo PC?

1060
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:46,120
Some like that, but because I'm gonna use, I wanted to use a nano ITX piece, um, you know, a motherboard, but they're not available yet, so I'm gonna have to use a micro ITX board, which is, uh...

1061
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:49,120
No, why not build one out of a, out of a, uh, PS2?

1062
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:50,120
Well, because...

1063
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:52,120
Because you can find plenty of broken PS2s.

1064
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:59,120
Well, Dreamcast is small, um, I wanted to use a, um, old PS1, because they sell for 30 bucks on the internet.

1065
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:00,120
I could give you one.

1066
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:10,720
Well, a PS1, but the board's too big for it. If I had a Nano ITX1, it would fit perfect, but as it is, it's, I don't know, I'm just pricing it, because it's kind of expensive.

1067
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:13,320
The Nintendo one was built out of laptop parts.

1068
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:22,520
Yeah, it's, that's one with a laptop hard drive, LCD monitor. I'm actually going to hack a portable PlayStation 1 LCD screen.

1069
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:25,020
They have a Dreamcast mobile monitor, though.

1070
01:24:25,020 --> 01:24:26,520
I'll have to check that, too, but...

1071
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:30,520
Um, I think, um, one of the, uh, uh, ones on, um, Licksang.

1072
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:32,020
Licksang, I'll go check them.

1073
01:24:32,020 --> 01:24:33,520
But anyways, yeah, that's what I'm gonna work on.

1074
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:35,020
It's gonna be kinda cool, cause I wanna, like,

1075
01:24:35,020 --> 01:24:38,020
I was actually, what I was setting up for was Minimame,

1076
01:24:38,020 --> 01:24:40,020
or, like, Minibomani stuff,

1077
01:24:40,020 --> 01:24:42,020
so, like, making a micro, um,

1078
01:24:42,020 --> 01:24:45,520
turntable Beatmania-type setup for, like, that kind of thing.

1079
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:48,520
But the only problem is they're not very powerful PCs.

1080
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:51,520
They've only, they only go up to, like, one gigahertz, and, um,

1081
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:56,020
cause they're just, you know, they're mic, no, um, fan or anything, but it's awesome.

1082
01:24:56,020 --> 01:25:01,900
They make the like they have like tiny fans now and heat sinks. Yeah. Anyway, that's the project. I'm working on

1083
01:25:02,900 --> 01:25:05,460
So you've given up on communicating with the dead. I

1084
01:25:06,260 --> 01:25:08,260
Have I have my eight and a half pound

1085
01:25:09,460 --> 01:25:11,900
eight and a half pounds of magnet wire in my room and

1086
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:15,140
I have my germanium on my desk and

1087
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:17,660
I

1088
01:25:17,660 --> 01:25:22,500
Actually is looking at copper today, but they only have a copper plated

1089
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:26,500
Um, circuit boards, but that might be good enough just to stick on there.

1090
01:25:26,500 --> 01:25:30,500
You can order copper from, from the science ordering places.

1091
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:32,500
Well, I just need a copper plate, and it's small.

1092
01:25:32,500 --> 01:25:36,500
Copper plate? Uh, I'll talk to you about that later, I think I know what to do with it.

1093
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:39,500
Anyways, but yeah, I'm just, I'm looking in the parts for that.

1094
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:43,500
The only thing is I figured out that the guy's design's physically impossible,

1095
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:49,500
because if you were to make something that strong in that small space, it would literally melt.

1096
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:54,060
melt. It would just be gone, so I don't know. This dead would take it over and it'd open

1097
01:25:54,060 --> 01:25:58,300
a portal to hell. No, it wouldn't do that. The only portal it opened would be burning

1098
01:25:58,300 --> 01:26:05,300
down the house, and I just don't... It couldn't... It couldn't maintain, though, the structural

1099
01:26:05,420 --> 01:26:09,940
integrity it needs to keep the portal to hell open, so it'd just burn up from the, you know,

1100
01:26:09,940 --> 01:26:14,980
the... from the Hades. No. But anyways, yeah, I'll do that later. It would be hotter than

1101
01:26:14,980 --> 01:26:18,980
I was pricing it today at RadioShack, but I don't like RadioShack because they're too expensive.

1102
01:26:27,980 --> 01:26:30,980
Okay, anyways. I'm gonna go back to drinking.

1103
01:26:33,980 --> 01:26:35,980
Yes, you learn quickly.

1104
01:26:40,980 --> 01:26:42,980
I don't know, I'm in a sound effects mood today.

1105
01:26:42,980 --> 01:26:48,980
today anyway let's go see if we got any guesses we actually only got one more

1106
01:26:48,980 --> 01:26:53,700
guess it looks like some people they want more time with this clue they want

1107
01:26:53,700 --> 01:26:58,420
more time with the a unique aspect of a type of cells in the body clue I'm

1108
01:26:58,420 --> 01:27:03,920
wondering how it feels to want well we will give another chance for guesses if

1109
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:07,740
there's still some people want to google it so they're googling away but we do

1110
01:27:07,740 --> 01:27:10,520
have paid attention in school that's all right

1111
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:13,920
Chaos Dimension suggests a song, and I've never heard of this,

1112
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:18,040
You Got Beef by Chuck E. Akins and V Unit.

1113
01:27:18,040 --> 01:27:22,400
Rob. Mel saying no, no, no.

1114
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:26,920
Rob. What? Isn't it nice to want?

1115
01:27:26,920 --> 01:27:30,520
Isn't it nice to say something that Jamie just said?

1116
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:33,720
Yeah, I just sort of said that.

1117
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:37,720
Rent! Pay it!

1118
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:42,440
Anyway, Seegerd got it right on the second guess as well as the first guess.

1119
01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:46,600
Amazingly enough, he sent me another message and he got it right. I was so amazed.

1120
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:51,800
If you got it right on the second guess, that's kind of like saying he battled himself in a race

1121
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:56,120
and he came in third place. Beautiful.

1122
01:27:58,040 --> 01:27:59,960
Beautiful. That means his ass came in last.

1123
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:04,520
Yeah, as somebody says in the chatroom,

1124
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:09,640
as I recall, you got beef is not a unique aspect of a type of cells in the body.

1125
01:28:09,640 --> 01:28:12,840
Maybe, well, you know, if you... We got the beef cells.

1126
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:16,240
If you call yourself maybe a beefy built guy, I don't know. Anyway,

1127
01:28:16,240 --> 01:28:21,240
moving on. Where'd Loki go? Did he disappear into the bathroom? Seriously. I want to talk to him.

1128
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:25,160
Just, like, pay attention in school.

1129
01:28:25,160 --> 01:28:28,680
See, people don't like to be made to think.

1130
01:28:28,680 --> 01:28:32,320
That's alright. It is hard. It is a hard clue.

1131
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:35,720
They're hard clues. This is why it's taking you so long to get it. Nobody likes to be

1132
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:36,680
made to think.

1133
01:28:36,680 --> 01:28:41,080
Because nobody thinks anymore. Chat room, prove me wrong.

1134
01:28:41,080 --> 01:28:44,680
Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp. Anyway.

1135
01:28:44,680 --> 01:28:49,960
See what I mean? Moving on. Uh, you guys know about the big

1136
01:28:49,960 --> 01:28:53,520
day of November 18th coming up. 18 November, some

1137
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:58,520
folks have been referring to it, where we get a whole shitload of new releases from Japan, including

1138
01:28:58,520 --> 01:29:02,880
Poppin' Music 10, and there is a brand new website open for Poppin' Music 10,

1139
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:06,040
and it doesn't give us a whole lot about the game, but

1140
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:09,920
it does show us those cute little Kubricks that are coming with a limited edition.

1141
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:14,160
So cute! Okay, I need to get that, because I need Poppin' Music Kubricks.

1142
01:29:14,160 --> 01:29:17,400
There's some more information in our chat room if you care.

1143
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:20,760
A link to the website that has more information.

1144
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:24,380
Also, 8th Style is going to be getting a limited edition with it, and apparently the

1145
01:29:24,380 --> 01:29:26,240
limited edition comes with some kind of

1146
01:29:26,240 --> 01:29:30,440
not what I thought was cool. Not only do you get a little EMU's card, but you also get

1147
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:35,500
from what I understand, there's going to be a DVD coming with it with videos of all the

1148
01:29:35,500 --> 01:29:37,640
new consumer songs on 8th Style.

1149
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:41,140
And who knows what those songs are? We haven't heard yet, but hopefully it's

1150
01:29:41,140 --> 01:29:41,760
good stuff.

1151
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:45,840
I think it will be. We'll soon find out. I was going to add a comment on

1152
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:51,840
8th Style. Yes. Actually, I got a report from DarkLionXVI this afternoon

1153
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:55,160
AKA Siggy. Yes. He was saying that the

1154
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:58,440
limited edition was going to be like retail that like a hundred thirty

1155
01:29:58,440 --> 01:29:59,160
dollars

1156
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:04,800
you know what I wish he was on Skype right now that column make him tell us

1157
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:06,080
more information about the game

1158
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:09,080
nevermind I was gonna say something but no

1159
01:30:09,080 --> 01:30:15,360
we knew who cares I want a style I guess that's true now saying

1160
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:18,280
who cares what's in it it's a hundred thirty bucks by it

1161
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:21,320
you know what's the problem just by it

1162
01:30:21,320 --> 01:30:24,320
And how?

1163
01:30:27,320 --> 01:30:29,320
Alright.

1164
01:30:29,320 --> 01:30:34,320
Ziggy's not on Skype right now. I'll try to call him later. Maybe he can give us more information about what's going on with the...

1165
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:43,320
Because I haven't been paying close enough attention. I'm getting confused enough at all the U.S. news going around that I can't keep track of the Japanese news as well, so...

1166
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:45,320
Anyway.

1167
01:30:45,320 --> 01:30:48,320
Shall we have ourselves a cage match, boys and girls?

1168
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:49,320
Let's do it!

1169
01:30:49,320 --> 01:30:57,720
it yay we's gonna have a cage match last week in the orange lounge cage match I

1170
01:30:57,720 --> 01:31:01,400
need a quiet in the studio please there's too much sidebar conversation

1171
01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:08,360
going on we can't hear ourselves thank you last week in the orange lounge radio

1172
01:31:08,360 --> 01:31:14,160
cage match we had bond one that was Jamie's pick with a song called shine

1173
01:31:14,160 --> 01:31:18,040
and what was so special about shine Jamie it used to some of the same

1174
01:31:18,040 --> 01:31:22,480
samples from Afronova yes so it has a little bit of a DDR tie into it so we'll

1175
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:26,020
hear that but you only get to hear a clip of last week's winner as a reminder

1176
01:31:26,020 --> 01:31:29,660
the way the cage match works we're gonna play three songs for you guys a clip of

1177
01:31:29,660 --> 01:31:34,600
last week's winner and two new songs and the winning song goes into rotation all

1178
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:40,060

1179
01:31:40,060 --> 01:31:43,820

1181
01:31:48,980 --> 01:31:52,580
chakra mix. Here's a clip. Enjoy.

1182
01:33:48,980 --> 01:34:08,500
Alright, that was last week's winner.

1183
01:34:08,500 --> 01:34:11,820
That was Bond with Shine, the dub chakra mix.

1184
01:34:11,820 --> 01:34:13,180
That song just makes me happy.

1185
01:34:13,180 --> 01:34:17,420
Will it win for two weeks in a row or will it succumb to one of our challengers tonight?

1186
01:34:17,420 --> 01:34:18,940
Let's find out.

1187
01:34:18,940 --> 01:34:23,660
This challenger tonight is one of my picks, and you know what, I have to admit, ever since

1188
01:34:23,660 --> 01:34:28,340
I heard that Skulk was announced for Ultramix, I've been liking that band Echo Image more

1189
01:34:28,340 --> 01:34:33,160
and more, and not the secret has anything to do with that by, you know, allowing me

1190
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:37,600
to borrow the CD for a little while, but honestly, like the more I listen to it, the more they

1191
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:42,120
remind me of like Erasure and all these cool synth bop bands I love, and I gotta say, I

1192
01:34:42,120 --> 01:34:47,000
love this song, and I want to put it in tonight's cage match, it's a song by Echo Image from

1193
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:52,400
their CD and the song is called Standing Alone. It's track two from their album. I believe

1194
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:57,280
it's called CompuPhonic. I'm going off the top of my head there. So here it is. So if

1195
01:34:57,280 --> 01:35:01,200
you like Skulk, you might like this. I don't know, we'll see. This is Echo Image with Standing

1196
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:02,200
Alone. Enjoy.

1197
01:35:32,200 --> 01:35:51,200
Make way for all the words they say, how could you know that they were true?

1198
01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:54,200
Whispering voices in your head

1199
01:35:54,200 --> 01:35:58,200
What can be done, what can be done

1200
01:35:58,200 --> 01:36:02,200
And all the words they seem to be

1201
01:36:02,200 --> 01:36:05,200
Not a statement

1202
01:36:05,200 --> 01:36:09,200
See them standing when you face it

1203
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:12,200
They're facing with your wife

1204
01:36:12,200 --> 01:36:16,200
Standing there alone again

1205
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:19,200
It all made another friend

1206
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:26,400
I'm watching down the road of pain Truth will never be the same

1207
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:33,200
Standing there alone again Still I need another friend

1208
01:36:33,200 --> 01:36:40,400
I'm watching down the road of pain Truth will never be the same

1209
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:47,600
Give way for another truthless day Your eyes end up sitting on your toes

1210
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:50,600
You hold your breath while feeling numb

1211
01:36:50,600 --> 01:36:54,600
Black rain clouds filling up the sun

1212
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:58,600
The shouting voices in your head

1213
01:36:58,600 --> 01:37:01,600
Tell you nothing

1214
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:05,600
You scream but no one hears you calling

1215
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:08,600
You left with all your lies

1216
01:37:08,600 --> 01:37:15,600
Lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies

1217
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:17,600
Yee-haw!

1218
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:19,600
Yee-haw!

1219
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:21,600
Yee-haw!

1220
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:23,600
Yee-haw!

1221
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:25,600
Standing there alone again,

1222
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:29,600
You shoulda made another friend,

1223
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:33,600
Warted down a load of planes,

1224
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:37,600
To tell them I need the same.

1225
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:39,600
Yee-haw!

1226
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:41,600
Yee-haw!

1227
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:44,600
You don't need another friend

1228
01:38:44,600 --> 01:38:48,600
Watching them float away

1229
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:51,600
Truth will never be the same

1230
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:54,600
And then they're alone again

1231
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:58,600
You don't need another friend

1232
01:38:58,600 --> 01:39:01,600
Watching them float away

1233
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:05,600
The truth will never be the same

1234
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:50,320
All right, as typical Orange Lounge fashion dictates, we'll go around and see what everyone

1235
01:39:50,320 --> 01:39:55,040
thought of Echo Image with standing alone and not standing alone there in the corners.

1236
01:39:55,040 --> 01:39:56,360
Dark Sakura with her impression.

1237
01:39:56,360 --> 01:39:59,960
It freaking sounds like Depeche Mode, I like it.

1238
01:39:59,960 --> 01:40:03,800
So that one gets a 9 for me.

1239
01:40:03,800 --> 01:40:04,800
Nice solid 9.

1240
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:06,680
And it's not trance.

1241
01:40:06,680 --> 01:40:07,680
Not really.

1242
01:40:07,680 --> 01:40:12,080
I was going to give it an 8.5, but it really pushed it up to a 9 because it wasn't trance.

1243
01:40:12,080 --> 01:40:15,960
It's like trance enough to satisfy my taste, but it's not trance.

1244
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:16,960
You're right.

1245
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:17,960
It's synthpop.

1246
01:40:17,960 --> 01:40:18,960
Big difference.

1247
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:22,440
Really, it just made me think of, oh, this is the days when Depeche Mode was cool.

1248
01:40:22,440 --> 01:40:23,440
I like it.

1249
01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:24,440
All right.

1250
01:40:24,440 --> 01:40:25,440
Moving on.

1251
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:26,440
Loki, what did you think of that?

1252
01:40:26,440 --> 01:40:29,280
Well, I have this CD in my car right now, and I've been listening to it over and over

1253
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:32,280
over and over again, so it gets a 9 for me also.

1254
01:40:32,280 --> 01:40:34,280
Mr. Floatwalk.

1255
01:40:34,280 --> 01:40:42,280
It's pretty solid. It's a smooth track. That's what I like. You know, you got all the cues to synth it off, but it's not overly, you know, like...

1256
01:40:42,280 --> 01:40:50,280
It's just not very loud and over-imposing. I just think it's something you can really relax to, and that's why I dig it a lot. I think I'll give it a 9 and a half.

1257
01:40:50,280 --> 01:40:52,280
Ooh, lanky-style.

1258
01:40:52,280 --> 01:41:01,280
I like it, man. So far, the two tracks I've heard from them have been really good, so I gotta listen to that CD sometime, so I'm gonna give it a 9. Good stuff.

1259
01:41:01,280 --> 01:41:03,280
Sharks Girl.

1260
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:06,280
Pretty. 9.

1261
01:41:06,280 --> 01:41:17,280
I'm gonna do something a little different, because I haven't given one of these in a while, but I'm giving that a nice, round, fat 10 out of 10, boys and girls, because honestly, that's one of the best CDs I've heard in a long time.

1262
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:24,280
a long time. It really grew on me. Like the first time I heard it, I was kind of like this is cool, but the more I listened to it, I was like, fuck! These guys rock!

1263
01:41:24,280 --> 01:41:33,280
So, um, honestly, whether you call it a race or a departmental, I don't care. They just rock. And I hope to God they put out more music and continue to be in DDR. Angel?

1264
01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:38,280
Uh, that sounds hot, as well as the rest of the CD, so you know what? Fat 10.

1265
01:41:38,280 --> 01:41:40,280
Cool. Another fat 10. Explicit.

1266
01:41:42,280 --> 01:41:44,280
This song gave me an orgasm.

1267
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:48,280
I like this song a lot though, so I give it a 9.5 out of 10.

1268
01:41:49,280 --> 01:41:51,280
Alright. Moving on.

1269
01:41:52,280 --> 01:41:54,280
Hi, how you doing Heather?

1270
01:41:55,280 --> 01:41:57,280
I'm like, who the hell did the mic go to?

1271
01:41:58,280 --> 01:42:01,280
Loki's sister's here, to give her an impression of the song.

1272
01:42:03,280 --> 01:42:05,280
Fine, I don't matter. No, I have been drinking, but not that much.

1273
01:42:05,280 --> 01:42:08,880
but not that much. I honestly wasn't listening to it so I really can't rate

1274
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:13,000
it. Then you're gonna give it a 10. Yeah, okay. All right. Hey, what's it like...

1275
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:18,000
Anorexic 10. What's it like to be Loki's sister? Is he really as evil? Was he evil

1276
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:24,480
like out of the womb? I don't know he was born before I was. Oh, that's right, you're

1277
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:27,760
a younger one. Okay, well has he been evil since being a toddler? As far back

1278
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:32,400
as you remember. He's chasing the fire poachers. Right on.

1279
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:37,400
I want more of these embarrassing Loki stories after Cagematch.

1280
01:42:37,400 --> 01:42:43,400
It was a fire poker. It was one of those log, like, you know how they have those things that pick up logs?

1281
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:46,400
It was a log grabber thing you could move logs in a fire poker.

1282
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:50,400
We are so sending Loki out of the room after Cagematch. I want more of these stories.

1283
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:56,400
Alright, anybody else? Does Loki's girlfriend want to give a number to that song?

1284
01:42:56,400 --> 01:42:59,400
Anyway, what song?

1285
01:42:59,400 --> 01:43:11,400
Next up is Loki's pick, and Loki has picked something very special for you guys tonight. Very special. It's special.

1286
01:43:11,400 --> 01:43:19,400
Okay, now I was gonna go with my remix, which, you know, that's just standard because I make it, and so it's gotta be in there.

1287
01:43:19,400 --> 01:43:26,960
But no, no, um, you know my fiance had better plans so she picked this song. I don't know who it's by

1288
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:29,520
it's

1289
01:43:29,520 --> 01:43:32,360
Called Papa Smurf lick my ass

1290
01:43:32,360 --> 01:43:42,000
From Loki's girlfriend via Loki, this is song number three tonight. Papa Smurf, can I lick your ass?

1291
01:44:02,360 --> 01:44:04,360
Make me smile in between the mountains

1292
01:44:04,360 --> 01:44:06,860
Come on in and on my face you'll see a big grin

1293
01:44:06,860 --> 01:44:08,360
I like a girl with a big tongue

1294
01:44:08,360 --> 01:44:10,360
When she opens up her mouth she can touch the rung

1295
01:44:10,360 --> 01:44:12,360
To get what's this, you gotta have guts

1296
01:44:12,360 --> 01:44:14,360
I like it when they rub my nuts

1297
01:44:14,360 --> 01:44:16,360
Lick my booty from the bottom to the top

1298
01:44:16,360 --> 01:44:19,360
Just don't bow, come on bitch just drive me crazy

1299
01:44:19,360 --> 01:44:21,360
Stick out your tongue, make me cry like a baby

1334
01:47:34,940 --> 01:47:36,220
for me to poop on

1335
01:47:44,140 --> 01:47:46,060
it gets a negative infinity

1336
01:47:46,060 --> 01:47:54,100
a score of negative infinity from Jamie let's hear from Loki I tell you this is

1337
01:47:54,100 --> 01:48:01,300
my fiance's pick I did it for her so it gets a 10 it's gonna be Rob song Rob

1338
01:48:01,300 --> 01:48:05,020
was gonna use this in another week so don't be getting pissed off at me this

1339
01:48:05,020 --> 01:48:10,500
is all Rob it's all his fault he's acting all innocent but it was all him

1340
01:48:10,500 --> 01:48:17,820
besides the flash video is much better flow walk wow I didn't even know pop it

1341
01:48:17,820 --> 01:48:28,540
through black that said yeah that said I got two words for it solo 2005 on scale

1342
01:48:28,540 --> 01:48:34,500
110 let's see well if we're talking booties I think an eight kind of looks

1343
01:48:34,500 --> 01:48:37,540
like a booty you know if you tilt it sideways no yeah I'm gonna give it an

1344
01:48:37,540 --> 01:48:45,540
Alright. You know what? I was going to put that in the cage match, but just because I was mad. I was just mad that I lost last week.

1345
01:48:45,540 --> 01:48:56,540
But, honestly, it gets a 6.9 from me because it's just not as funny without the Flash animation to go with it. So, a 6.9 from me.

1346
01:48:56,540 --> 01:48:57,540
Sharks Girl!

1347
01:48:57,540 --> 01:49:01,540
That was the deepest and most meaningful song I've ever heard in my life.

1348
01:49:01,540 --> 01:49:02,540
Deep.

1349
01:49:02,540 --> 01:49:11,540
Wow, I'm just overwhelmed by the beauty of it all. I give it like a 3 for the comedy factor.

1350
01:49:11,540 --> 01:49:14,540
Alright, DDR Angel.

1351
01:49:14,540 --> 01:49:16,540
It looks like an ass too, there you go.

1352
01:49:16,540 --> 01:49:17,540
DDR Angel, what do you think?

1353
01:49:17,540 --> 01:49:21,540
Let's see, Comedial Factor 6.

1354
01:49:21,540 --> 01:49:25,540
Explicit.

1355
01:49:25,540 --> 01:49:33,540
No fucking comment. I'll just give it a question mark because it all depends on the people.

1356
01:49:35,540 --> 01:49:39,540
Okay, I'll give it an 8, equal sign 3.

1357
01:49:39,540 --> 01:49:45,540
Alright, 8 equals 3 from Jonas. Uh, lankystyle, did you have a vote you wanted to give?

1358
01:49:45,540 --> 01:49:46,540
Penisheep.

1359
01:49:46,540 --> 01:49:53,540
I think what I have to say is that, uh, Pop the Smurf should watch out because I'm sure she looked all the other Smurf's asses before she got to him.

1360
01:49:53,540 --> 01:50:02,380
him yeah I give it a I mean it's a great song and all but gag factor is basically

1361
01:50:02,380 --> 01:50:08,780
all so yeah comedy ten song is a whole eight that's not reminds me of the

1362
01:50:08,780 --> 01:50:14,220
fanfic that my roommate roommate from college had printed out on that you

1363
01:50:14,220 --> 01:50:17,860
remember back in the days when printer paper was all green and white and had

1364
01:50:17,860 --> 01:50:23,420
the tearing edges on the side well my friend went to the computer lab at my

1365
01:50:23,420 --> 01:50:30,540
school this is in 1995 mind you printed up the smuck fest someone had written a

1366
01:50:30,540 --> 01:50:36,860
lemon fanfic about the first getting it on rose it was scary but that's what I

1367
01:50:36,860 --> 01:50:40,040
thought makes me think of let's wrap this up so we can get past this topic

1368
01:50:40,040 --> 01:50:43,860

1370
01:50:50,340 --> 01:50:54,340
Having seen the animation for it, I have to say a ten.

1371
01:50:54,340 --> 01:50:56,340
Oh wow, a ten.

1372
01:50:56,340 --> 01:50:59,340
You're easy to please. You gave two tens tonight.

1373

Alright, that's alright.

1374

1381
01:52:00,060 --> 01:52:08,020
things so thank you Jamie moving on you are welcome moving on let's uh Loki watch

1382
01:52:08,020 --> 01:52:11,060
give us a sim update what's going on in the sim world I know you've built your

1383
01:52:11,060 --> 01:52:18,900
own thing and I know there's food makes news all sorts of fun stuff well done

1384
01:52:18,900 --> 01:52:25,100
okay anyways um no there is some another I think camera versus last week or this

1385
01:52:25,100 --> 01:52:29,300
week there was another update to techno fiend it looks nice it's got some cool

1386
01:52:29,300 --> 01:52:31,300
What's Techno Theme?

1387
01:52:59,300 --> 01:53:07,660
just announced this week that Food Mix Plus had hidden content in it. And now I have on

1388
01:53:07,660 --> 01:53:11,780
our website how you can get to that hidden content. Basically there is a dummy file in

1389
01:53:11,780 --> 01:53:16,700
one of the directories there and you turn that into a zip file and you get a brand new

1390
01:53:16,700 --> 01:53:24,860
song, new steps for some of the older songs, and new Oni courses. So that's pretty cool.

1391
01:53:24,860 --> 01:53:40,860
And then, other than that, really not that much else. Oh! Oh! No, it should be mentioned. The first pack of ripped characters from DDR 5th Mix has surfaced online. You can find the link on DDR Mania X for that one.

1392
01:53:40,860 --> 01:53:49,860
And they're pretty nice looking. They're ripped directly from the DDR games because the guy that, um, he built his own software to do that kind of stuff, so that's kind of neat.

1393
01:53:49,860 --> 01:53:59,860
And, um, other than that, really, um, not too much else, uh, DDR OSC 3 is going on right now. I think the first pack of songs has been released for that.

1394
01:53:59,860 --> 01:54:04,580
And I know DDR the remix contests on the my style and

1395
01:54:05,160 --> 01:54:09,040
DDR maniacs I think are up already. They're done. They should be posting those

1396
01:54:09,560 --> 01:54:15,340
Those songs online for voting soon, and I think that's all yeah

1397
01:54:16,800 --> 01:54:19,780
What you need a mic because we're not gonna hear you

1398
01:54:21,160 --> 01:54:24,560
They added a comment section on be my install already for the Sims

1399
01:54:25,680 --> 01:54:27,860
Yeah, that's that's new. You already have that

1400
01:54:27,860 --> 01:54:30,860
Yeah, because I just noticed about that.

1401
01:54:57,860 --> 01:55:00,680
answer answer answer answer

1402
01:55:00,680 --> 01:55:02,680
yeah believe it or not we're calling out

1403
01:55:02,680 --> 01:55:04,280
we don't do this whole lot

1404
01:55:04,280 --> 01:55:06,320
when a radio show calls out

1405
01:55:06,320 --> 01:55:10,180
that means you're a shock job you're doing stupid bits

1406
01:55:10,180 --> 01:55:13,560
is your refrigerator running

1407
01:55:13,560 --> 01:55:14,880
oh hey Siggy what's up

1408
01:55:14,880 --> 01:55:16,520

1409
01:55:16,520 --> 01:55:19,580
I thought you were going to scot me after cage match

1410
01:55:19,580 --> 01:55:21,920
well the cage match is done we're just waiting for the votes

1411
01:55:21,920 --> 01:55:23,840
oh ok alright

01:55:23,840 --> 01:55:27,720
so tell me what you know about these new eight style limited editions and stuff

1413
01:55:27,720 --> 01:55:32,520
Because I haven't really been following it, because I can barely keep track of what's going on domestically, let alone importly.

1414
01:55:32,520 --> 01:55:35,020
So, share what you know with us, would ya?

1415
01:55:35,020 --> 01:55:39,520
Well, here's what I've known so far about 2DX 8-Style Special Edition.

1416
01:55:39,520 --> 01:55:45,220
They have a, well, along with 8-Style, they have a 2DX Red E-Amusement card.

1417
01:55:45,220 --> 01:55:51,120
It's gonna be random, so we'll never know what's inside each art cover for that.

1418
01:55:51,120 --> 01:55:52,120
Huh.

1419
01:55:52,120 --> 01:55:55,420
Yeah, they have a 2DX Visual Emotion DVD.

1420
01:55:55,420 --> 01:55:57,520
Oh, I can't wait for that DVD.

1421
01:55:57,520 --> 01:56:01,760
Yeah. Let me see, I'm reading the translation right now.

1422
01:56:01,760 --> 01:56:05,040
Yeah, they have the H-Style V-Rare soundtrack.

1423
01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:08,360
Ooh, an H-Style V-Rare, really? Yeah.

1424
01:56:08,360 --> 01:56:12,720
Ooh, that should be cool, okay. And then the H-Style special edition,

1425
01:56:12,720 --> 01:56:15,960
special-made box, like, you know, like a box for

1426
01:56:15,960 --> 01:56:19,160
stacking your preview styles from, you know, from

1427
01:56:19,160 --> 01:56:24,600
5th, 6th, 7th, or whatever. Very nice. And then, of course, here's still a little bit

1428
01:56:24,600 --> 01:56:25,360
interesting.

1429
01:56:25,360 --> 01:56:28,600
It's a BeatMeIna 3DX style mail magazine.

1430
01:56:28,600 --> 01:56:31,800
Like M-A-I-L or M-A-L-E?

1431
01:56:31,800 --> 01:56:35,200
M-A-I-L. Okay, darn.

1432
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:40,880
Alright. And with any other information on what's going to be on that magazine?

1433
01:56:40,880 --> 01:56:44,240
Well, it's just a subscription about, you know, the 2DX styles.

1434
01:56:44,240 --> 01:56:47,920
Huh. However, you can only subscribe...

1435
01:56:47,920 --> 01:56:53,640
We're losing you. Speak into the mic a little more. We're losing you. However, you're only going to have to subscribe within Japan.

1436
01:56:53,640 --> 01:57:19,640
And I checked out on the WebKonami website for T-Rex XL, the price is about 106,000 yen which is, I think, or actually 10,479 yen, including tax.

1437
01:57:19,640 --> 01:57:22,640
That sounds like a lot, but it's not quite that bad.

1438
01:57:22,640 --> 01:57:26,640
Which is approximately $130 according to ntsx.com.

1439
01:57:26,640 --> 01:57:30,640
Alright. Well, I'll be looking forward to it. Thanks for the update, Siggy.

1440
01:57:30,640 --> 01:57:31,640
No problem.

1441
01:57:31,640 --> 01:57:32,640
Alright, take care, bud.

1442
01:57:32,640 --> 01:57:33,640
Later.

1443
01:57:33,640 --> 01:57:34,640
Later.

1444
01:57:34,640 --> 01:57:41,640
That's also known as DarkLionXVI. Some more information on 2DXA style. Very cool.

1445
01:57:41,640 --> 01:57:44,640
Just to clear up something from our chat room.

1446
01:57:44,640 --> 01:57:47,640
Hey OrangeLawnsRadio, if I'm not correct, isn't this the first time you've ever called out?

1447
01:57:47,640 --> 01:57:52,540
called out. Actually it is not. We called out one other time and that was we were

1448
01:57:52,540 --> 01:57:56,800
calling the person who correctly guessed. You remember Zonk Tittle Tattle? We told

1449
01:57:56,800 --> 01:57:59,920
you guys about that a couple weeks ago and Jazz was the person that got that

1450
01:57:59,920 --> 01:58:02,360
right. We actually called him so it's not the first time we've called out but

1451
01:58:02,360 --> 01:58:08,920
second. Anywho, speaking of guessing since the cage match voting is now closed I'm

1452
01:58:08,920 --> 01:58:12,200
gonna tell you guys who won that. Let's go ahead and let you guys have another

1453
01:58:12,200 --> 01:58:18,200
chance to guess what that mystery song could be. So, Footwalk, did you have

1454
01:58:18,200 --> 01:58:22,640
anything you want to add? Oh yeah, like when people tell you, you know, are you

1455
01:58:22,640 --> 01:58:26,600
getting cold, are you getting hot? I will say someone in the room is pretty

1456
01:58:26,600 --> 01:58:32,320
freaking hot. Mmm, very interesting. Yeah, I know I'm not talking about myself

1457
01:58:32,320 --> 01:58:40,880
either, but. Some of us just can't help it. Oh my, all right. We're gonna go to a

1458
01:58:40,880 --> 01:58:44,780
break pretty soon I think we're just gonna we're just gonna do like a bunch

1459
01:58:44,780 --> 01:58:53,720
of like random songs in this next break so we'll probably do that well I gotta

1460
01:58:53,720 --> 01:58:56,960
find those songs though so somebody has to help me fill time who's gonna help

1461
01:58:56,960 --> 01:59:06,440
full time oh I've had how many shots now like I think well most of this glass so

1462
01:59:06,440 --> 01:59:13,680
that would be six shots yeah I'm feeling okay but a little dizzy little slightly

1463
01:59:13,680 --> 01:59:21,600
dizzy you know what not really I feel we're like it's you know if it were a

1464
01:59:21,600 --> 01:59:26,640
cheat night it would be on I need to sit down with someone with some either dark

1465
01:59:26,640 --> 01:59:33,640
rum or tequila and just do shots.

1466
01:59:35,840 --> 01:59:41,120
Um, let's see.

1467
01:59:41,120 --> 01:59:46,440
Okay, um, other than that, let's see, what else can I talk about?

1468
01:59:46,440 --> 01:59:48,320
I should have brought my amaretto for you.

1469
01:59:48,320 --> 01:59:49,640
Oh, oh!

1470
01:59:49,640 --> 01:59:53,360
You know what, actually, um, where's Gypsy Wolf? Because the chat room is reminding me of

1471
01:59:53,360 --> 01:59:54,900
something. Gypsy Wolf,

1472
01:59:54,900 --> 01:59:56,900
We need- we need embarrassing Loki stories.

1473
01:59:56,900 --> 01:59:59,400
Can we give you a couple minutes?

1474
01:59:59,400 --> 02:00:02,400
I suppose we can give you a couple minutes. Alright, in the meantime, Loki.

1475
02:00:02,400 --> 02:00:04,400
We'll do embarrassing Loki stories after the break.

1476
02:00:04,400 --> 02:00:07,400
We do have to get into the Effies of the Week soon, though.

1477
02:00:07,400 --> 02:00:11,400
Do you guys want to hear who won tonight's cage match, actually?

1478
02:00:11,400 --> 02:00:12,900
I guess.

1479
02:00:12,900 --> 02:00:14,400
We'll get to it in a minute.

1480
02:00:14,400 --> 02:00:19,400
But I will tell you that one song just, like, obliterated the competition.

1481
02:00:19,400 --> 02:00:24,400
It totally blew the competition out of the water. Can you guess what song it is?

1482
02:00:24,400 --> 02:00:26,800
Which song would you guys think it is that obliterated the others?

1483
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:34,400
Papa Smurfs Papa Smurfs. What do you think women because our listeners tend to go for the gross potty humor

1484
02:00:34,640 --> 02:00:40,200
All right. Well, I mean how else did Loki win the cage match by singing? I'm staying in here

1485
02:00:40,480 --> 02:00:43,020
Here's tonight's winner of the orange lounge cage match

1486
02:00:43,020 --> 02:00:51,020
Chat room, you have restored my faith in you.

1487
02:00:51,020 --> 02:00:57,020
All right, very nice. An upset there by Echo Image winning tonight's cage match was standing

1488
02:00:57,020 --> 02:00:58,020
alone.

1489
02:00:58,020 --> 02:01:00,500
I'm still getting my revenge next week.

1490
02:01:00,500 --> 02:01:05,900
About twice the votes that Bond got. Papa Smurf got one pity.

1491
02:01:05,900 --> 02:01:10,260
Oh my God, our listeners have taste.

1492
02:01:10,260 --> 02:01:11,260
Very nice.

1493
02:01:11,260 --> 02:01:15,460
Oh, and Nelly says they obviously don't.

1494
02:01:15,460 --> 02:01:17,060
Oh, Nelly's upset.

1495
02:01:17,060 --> 02:01:18,060
That's alright.

1496
02:01:18,060 --> 02:01:24,220
You know, I would even, I would even go on a limb and say that this almost restores my

1497
02:01:24,220 --> 02:01:25,220
faith in humanity.

1498
02:01:25,220 --> 02:01:26,220
Almost.

1499
02:01:26,220 --> 02:01:28,500
Almost, but not quite.

1500
02:01:28,500 --> 02:01:36,140
I know, I wouldn't go quite that far, but okay.

1501
02:01:36,140 --> 02:01:41,220
Let's see, I'm still trying to prep for the next break, because there's songs

1502
02:01:41,220 --> 02:01:44,260
I'm looking for a little random mix of songs. I want to play for you guys certainly

1503
02:01:44,260 --> 02:01:50,460
I want to know who that one person was what one person the one person who voted I would share, but I'll let them

1504
02:01:51,180 --> 02:01:53,540
Reveal their identity in the chat room if they want to oh

1505
02:01:57,380 --> 02:01:58,620
Free

1506
02:01:58,620 --> 02:02:04,420
Mel says a free max to be rare if the max to or an extreme. Oh, he only says max to

1507
02:02:05,460 --> 02:02:10,420
Hey, hey, that's stupid. How's it going? Hey, I might have fallen for that because I would have been all be rare

1508
02:02:10,420 --> 02:02:13,600
I'll just throw a, like, a giant paper mache V at them.

1509
02:02:13,600 --> 02:02:18,620
Alright, um, sorry guys, sorry guys, we can't take requests this break because we have songs

1510
02:02:18,620 --> 02:02:24,060
we really, really want to play for you guys, and, uh, here we go, we will be right back

1511
02:02:24,060 --> 02:02:27,440
with more Orange Launch Radio and the FUs of the Week coming up when we get back as

1512
02:02:27,440 --> 02:02:28,440
well.

1513
02:02:28,440 --> 02:02:29,440
Please don't send those in yet.

1514
02:02:29,440 --> 02:02:30,440
Any more clues?

1515
02:02:30,440 --> 02:02:31,440
More clues?

1516
02:02:31,440 --> 02:02:35,440
Maybe, but, um, send in those, uh, guesses right now.

1517
02:02:35,440 --> 02:02:42,440
The Clues Never Stop here on Orange Lake Radio. We'll be back.

1518
02:04:05,440 --> 02:04:09,040
Anytime that I hear the jacks play I gotta tell them have a double skit out my way

1519
02:04:09,040 --> 02:04:12,540
Puts up the kids and I'm playing some keys I can buy a stereo, you can keep the receipts

And nobody moves the crowd the way I do I've hit brand new boys on my charges

1521
02:04:15,940 --> 02:04:18,740
Heard the boom boom baby girl never get beat off Johnny Dynamite

1522
02:04:18,740 --> 02:04:20,740
Let them know I've been here, the jacks the only one

break it down for me now yo

1527
02:04:54,260 --> 02:04:57,300
like they used to do with the house beat to it and before i'm through with my

1528
02:05:57,300 --> 02:06:01,300
Just a nightfall, the first time

1529
02:06:01,300 --> 02:06:04,300
Just about half past ten

1530
02:06:04,300 --> 02:06:08,300
For the first time in history

1531
02:06:08,300 --> 02:06:12,300
Gotta start prayin' then

1532
02:06:12,300 --> 02:06:15,300
It's prayin' then

1533
02:06:15,300 --> 02:06:18,300
Hallelujah, it's prayin' then

1534
02:06:18,300 --> 02:06:19,300
Amen

1535
02:06:19,300 --> 02:06:22,300
It's prayin' then

1536
02:06:22,300 --> 02:06:25,300
Hallelujah, it's prayin' then

1537
02:06:55,300 --> 02:06:58,580
informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

1538
02:06:58,580 --> 02:07:02,980
is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

1539
02:07:02,980 --> 02:07:08,980
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

1540
02:07:08,980 --> 02:07:12,020
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1541
02:07:12,020 --> 02:07:15,740
Logie. Hallelujah, it's raining men.

1542
02:07:15,740 --> 02:07:19,660
Moving on, we are

1543
02:07:19,660 --> 02:07:23,820
speaking of, you know, things that have been

1544
02:07:23,820 --> 02:07:27,260
coming over me private message we have some more guesses

1545
02:07:27,260 --> 02:07:30,400
for the song that we've been trying to guess all night long

1546
02:07:30,400 --> 02:07:34,420
Mel, it starts off with, I'm sorry, Float, it starts off with this one

1547
02:07:34,420 --> 02:07:39,320
this is a good one from El Mullet the guess is Divine Sweet Divide by Tanya

1548
02:07:39,320 --> 02:07:40,620
Donole and this is why

1549
02:07:40,620 --> 02:07:43,820
the jam on the bagel is sweet and sells divide

1550
02:07:43,820 --> 02:07:46,940
too abstract sorry yeah a little bit too abstract but

1551
02:07:46,940 --> 02:07:51,020
not a bad guess there I like the way you're thinking

1552
02:07:51,020 --> 02:07:52,840
Yeah, I like the ways that you do.

1553
02:07:52,840 --> 02:07:56,440
John Field says, cytoplasm by WND Games.

1554
02:07:56,440 --> 02:07:58,380
Cytoplasm is unique in all cells.

1555
02:07:58,380 --> 02:08:00,520
In fact, it holds everything inside a cell,

1556
02:08:00,520 --> 02:08:02,800
and a cell always has a nucleus, which

1557
02:08:02,800 --> 02:08:05,000
is round like a doughnut hole.

1558
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:06,200
Sold.

1559
02:08:06,200 --> 02:08:08,720
Not quite.

1560
02:08:08,720 --> 02:08:11,440
Although probably right now, with these guesses,

1561
02:08:11,440 --> 02:08:13,280
I'm probably relearning everything.

1562
02:08:13,280 --> 02:08:15,440
I've forgotten physiology, man.

1563
02:08:15,440 --> 02:08:18,320
I sucked at biology, except when we talked

1564
02:08:18,320 --> 02:08:19,560
about the reproductive system.

1565
02:08:19,560 --> 02:08:21,560
Oh yeah, I aced that sucker.

1566
02:08:22,560 --> 02:08:24,560
Alright, that's all the guesses so far.

1567
02:08:24,560 --> 02:08:26,560
That's all?

1568
02:08:26,560 --> 02:08:27,560
Yeah, that's it so far.

1569
02:08:27,560 --> 02:08:29,560
My goodness.

1570
02:08:29,560 --> 02:08:32,560
We'll see you a little later.

1571
02:08:32,560 --> 02:08:34,560
We'll open it up for more guesses.

1572
02:08:34,560 --> 02:08:37,560
Like I said guys, I mentioned before the last music bed.

1573
02:08:37,560 --> 02:08:40,560
Someone in the room is very hot on its trail.

1574
02:08:40,560 --> 02:08:45,560
After that last batch, somebody else is just like smoking, honestly.

1575
02:08:45,560 --> 02:08:48,560
I mean, just thinking a little too far into it.

1576
02:08:48,560 --> 02:08:52,560
Can you honestly clue me into what we're talking about?

1577
02:08:52,560 --> 02:08:55,560
Shut up.

1578
02:08:55,560 --> 02:08:57,560
Alright.

1579
02:08:57,560 --> 02:09:02,560
Let's see, I think we should do the FUs of the Week now. What do you guys think?

1580
02:09:02,560 --> 02:09:06,560
Okay, we don't have to. I mean, we can just stay here.

1581
02:09:06,560 --> 02:09:09,560
Damn it, I need to vent.

1582
02:09:09,560 --> 02:09:13,560
You know what? No, I'm sorry. Before we vent, though, where's Gypsy Wolf?

1583
02:09:13,560 --> 02:09:16,560
Because the chat room is begging for more Loki stories.

1584
02:09:16,560 --> 02:09:19,920
Loki, could you please leave the room for a minute? Bye, Loki.

1585
02:09:19,920 --> 02:09:24,320
Yes, bye. No, Loki. Bye, Loki. Nellie, can you take him in the bedroom?

1586
02:09:24,320 --> 02:09:26,320
Oh, what's the worst? All he's going to do is object to things.

1587
02:09:26,320 --> 02:09:29,360
All right, all right, yeah. He won't have a microphone, so it won't matter.

1588
02:09:29,360 --> 02:09:34,400
So, any funny childhood stories from Loki?

1589
02:09:34,400 --> 02:09:38,560
Okay, well, okay. Anybody's familiar with constructs?

1590
02:09:38,560 --> 02:09:41,840
The building toys? The kind of snapular? Those little blue things?

1591
02:09:41,840 --> 02:09:45,840
Whatever. Okay, well, one thing that, you know, I used to do

1592
02:09:45,840 --> 02:09:50,240
would be this this was also before i was no this was after i was born but i was too young to

1593
02:09:50,240 --> 02:09:55,680
remember most of it i saw pictures my mom showed me so anyway but you would build um power suits

1594
02:09:55,680 --> 02:10:01,760
out of the constructs and run around the house with them you know shoot the dog whatever was cool

1595
02:10:02,400 --> 02:10:07,680
but uh i don't know i can't really remember all that dad oh the one that was the best thing i

1596
02:10:07,680 --> 02:10:13,120
love this this wasn't embarrassing this is just fun um it was uh it was mission control with our

1597
02:10:13,120 --> 02:10:20,960
dog and Matt would look you would sit there and he would our dog our Labrador

1598
02:10:20,960 --> 02:10:26,200
would walk around the house and do stuff eat drink etc her normal thing and he

1599
02:10:26,200 --> 02:10:30,060
would say Houston we are taking in water and she would drink basically I would do

1600
02:10:30,060 --> 02:10:34,680
I would do the you know the ground control at NASA's commentary on

1601
02:10:34,680 --> 02:10:39,300
everything that my dog was doing as if it were like some sort of spaceship or

1602
02:10:39,300 --> 02:10:44,220
something it made people crack up like craziness funny um it was great when she

1603
02:10:44,220 --> 02:10:48,040
was downloading you know cargo and taking a dump out back oh yeah but it

1604
02:10:48,040 --> 02:10:54,800
was great jettisoning fuel my dog is awesome she's dead anyway pets are cool

1605
02:10:54,800 --> 02:11:01,800
but you know I mean that is so wrong what else were they used to do oh yeah

1606
02:11:01,800 --> 02:11:05,960
we have like um what else was it um I can't remember much we I mean we did a

1607
02:11:05,960 --> 02:11:09,960
We did a lot with Marble Works. We did a lot of crap with that. We put water down them and shit.

1608
02:11:09,960 --> 02:11:13,960
We hit Army Men in Mom's Bicus Tree.

1609
02:11:13,960 --> 02:11:17,960
No, I remember now. I have a water balloon launcher

1610
02:11:17,960 --> 02:11:21,960
and I used to launch tennis balls at the people on the bike trail

1611
02:11:21,960 --> 02:11:25,960
over the green belt from us. It was cool because you can, like, hit those people

1612
02:11:25,960 --> 02:11:29,960
from 200 yards away. And we got lucky one time and we hit a guy

1613
02:11:29,960 --> 02:11:33,960
and he fell over and that was funny. Yeah, that was that and then there was those little

1614
02:11:33,960 --> 02:11:37,720
guys you could do, or you could get army men and strap parachutes to them on really windy

1615
02:11:37,720 --> 02:11:42,300
days, they'd fly right over the house. You'd watch them go. Like, bye! Melted quite a few

1616
02:11:42,300 --> 02:11:49,300
army men too, that was kinda cool. I'm trying to think. Did he ever shit himself or anything?

1617
02:11:49,660 --> 02:11:55,960
I ate dog food. As a kid. He ate a whole entire bowl of gravy train. Gravy from ear to ear

1618
02:11:55,960 --> 02:11:59,520
when he was a kid. Dude, it had meat in it, okay? If it's good enough for the dog, it's

1619
02:11:59,520 --> 02:12:00,520
Meech!

1620
02:12:00,520 --> 02:12:01,520
Give me Meech!

1621
02:12:01,520 --> 02:12:05,720
The dog's like, what the hell, where'd my food go?

1622
02:12:05,720 --> 02:12:08,580
Alright, well thank you for sharing those with us, we needed some good embarrassing

1623
02:12:08,580 --> 02:12:11,880
Loki stories, so...

1624
02:12:11,880 --> 02:12:13,800
They weren't that bad, but they were still funny.

1625
02:12:13,800 --> 02:12:14,800
They were cute.

1626
02:12:14,800 --> 02:12:15,920
They were cute.

1627
02:12:15,920 --> 02:12:21,840
I killed the man with a trident through his chest.

1628
02:12:21,840 --> 02:12:22,840
I found-

1629
02:12:22,840 --> 02:12:25,840
It's from Anchorman, I'm sorry.

1630
02:12:25,840 --> 02:12:26,840
Alright.

1631
02:12:26,840 --> 02:12:27,840
Okay.

1632
02:12:27,840 --> 02:12:29,840
Yes, Dark Sakura.

1633
02:12:29,840 --> 02:12:30,840
Nothing.

1634
02:12:30,840 --> 02:12:31,840
Alright.

1635
02:12:31,840 --> 02:12:32,840
Then I think it's...

1636
02:12:32,840 --> 02:12:33,840
I think it's...

1637
02:12:33,840 --> 02:12:34,840
I have pictures too.

1638
02:12:34,840 --> 02:12:37,200
Do you have pictures?

1639
02:12:37,200 --> 02:12:38,200
They have pictures too.

1640
02:12:38,200 --> 02:12:40,720
It's in my photo album somewhere.

1641
02:12:40,720 --> 02:12:41,720
My baby photo album.

1642
02:12:41,720 --> 02:12:42,720
Does this mean we can call you Alpo?

1643
02:12:42,720 --> 02:12:43,720
Uh, I think it was Gravy Train.

1644
02:12:43,720 --> 02:12:44,720
Gravy Train!

1645
02:12:44,720 --> 02:12:57,720
It was the kind that you pour in the water into it and it makes the gravy.

1646
02:12:57,720 --> 02:13:01,720
Did you go around chasing the little imaginary, you know, wagon?

1647
02:13:03,720 --> 02:13:04,720
No.

1648
02:13:05,720 --> 02:13:08,720
I have a question. Loki, what does this remind you of?

1649
02:13:12,720 --> 02:13:13,720
L3?

1650
02:13:13,720 --> 02:13:14,720
No.

1651
02:13:17,720 --> 02:13:18,720
Rob?

1652
02:13:18,720 --> 02:13:19,720
What?

1653
02:13:19,720 --> 02:13:23,720
I just had the worst idea ever, and no, this had nothing to do with Andrew.

1654
02:13:23,720 --> 02:13:24,720
Okay?

1655
02:13:24,720 --> 02:13:27,600
Next remix for Loki.

1656
02:13:27,600 --> 02:13:31,680
Uh, long chain runnin' but he has to do something with

1657
02:13:31,680 --> 02:13:36,520
dogs or something. He probably needs to do a remix of Disco Dog.

1658
02:13:36,520 --> 02:13:39,840
Anyway, let's get into the FUs of the Week.

1659
02:13:39,840 --> 02:13:45,040
Alright, Jamie why do we have to do the FUs of the Week every single week on

1660
02:13:45,040 --> 02:13:45,560
this show?

1661
02:13:45,560 --> 02:13:52,560
cuz we're full of to anger

1662
02:14:02,500 --> 02:14:06,040
an FU to John Fields for making me laugh while I have a headache

1663
02:14:06,040 --> 02:14:12,800
for shiny disco dog balls

1664
02:14:12,800 --> 02:14:26,800
My first F.U. goes to the chat room for not guessing correctly, and not enough of you guessing, so god damn it guess, and to Silent Ben for misspelling the word that you misspelled.

1665
02:14:26,800 --> 02:14:44,400
There's a site called dictionary.com, just use it, learn how to spell please people and

1666
02:14:44,400 --> 02:14:52,920
learn grammar and by the way, you is not spelled you, that is a letter, it's y-o-u, your is

1667
02:14:52,920 --> 02:14:58,200
spelled y-o-u-apostrophe-r-e or y-o-u-r depending on the context you're using the

1668
02:14:58,200 --> 02:15:06,960
word not you are okay now if they put apostrophe u apostrophe u then that

1669
02:15:06,960 --> 02:15:12,040
would be okay how would it be okay because an apostrophe is for if you're

1670
02:15:12,040 --> 02:15:17,760
shortening the word so but there are only certain allowed abbreviations of

1671
02:15:17,760 --> 02:15:26,600
words that are grammatically correct that are commonly accepted by people who

1672
02:15:26,600 --> 02:15:30,680
have been educated that doesn't matter we the third grade they're not educated

1673
02:15:30,680 --> 02:15:37,760
we know that and normally normally I'm I've gotten a whole but I've gotten off

1674
02:15:37,760 --> 02:15:42,960
of my whole grammar fiend kick I got it like but it just I hit my saturation

1675
02:15:42,960 --> 02:15:45,200
point sometimes.

1676
02:15:45,200 --> 02:15:59,640
So anyway, another F.U. goes to the people on the road who

1677
02:15:59,640 --> 02:16:03,320
are major assholes and don't know how to drive.

1678
02:16:03,320 --> 02:16:07,680
Amazingly enough, my drive here was without incident.

1679
02:16:07,680 --> 02:16:11,240
But a lot of my driving lately, especially to and from

1680
02:16:11,240 --> 02:16:15,920
work have been full of people who usually drive semis who don't know how

1681
02:16:15,920 --> 02:16:22,800
to drive semis are cool okay I hate the ones that are like the trucks full of

1682
02:16:22,800 --> 02:16:26,880
gravel but the gravel flies all the way up I have a crack in my windshield now

1683
02:16:26,880 --> 02:16:32,280
because of the freaking rock truck it's like you asked and it's gonna cost like

1684
02:16:32,280 --> 02:16:36,480
$300 if I wanted to replace my windshield I mean it's so minor that I

1685
02:16:36,480 --> 02:16:39,800
can live with the look but it's there and right in the corner of my vision

1686
02:16:39,800 --> 02:16:46,500
it's like it's it there's what my car is already raped and now I've got a crack

1687
02:16:46,500 --> 02:16:49,780
it's not a crack it's like it's not a crack it's a chip in the windshield is

1688
02:16:49,780 --> 02:16:59,860
what it is and up his meal so so uh another if you goes to the hot I I

1689
02:16:59,860 --> 02:17:05,180
really dislike this part of living in Sacramento I love the winter because I

1690
02:17:05,180 --> 02:17:09,220
like the rain a whole lot and I like the one I moved out here it was raining and

1691
02:17:09,220 --> 02:17:12,220
I was like, oh, it's just like Alabama, yay.

1692
02:17:12,220 --> 02:17:18,940
But anyway, it's just a pain in the ass.

1693
02:17:18,940 --> 02:17:21,060
You know, we think this is getting real cool.

1694
02:17:21,060 --> 02:17:24,020
And then it's hot, so it's like, what's up with that?

1695
02:17:24,020 --> 02:17:27,460
Also, an F.U. goes to my apartment manager for me

1696
02:17:27,460 --> 02:17:30,660
having told her weekly for the last month

1697
02:17:30,660 --> 02:17:32,540
to fix my goddamn air conditioning,

1698
02:17:32,540 --> 02:17:34,100
and it's not fixed yet.

1699
02:17:34,100 --> 02:17:37,300
And again, with it getting into triple digit heat

1700
02:17:37,300 --> 02:17:38,960
and not having a working air conditioner,

1701
02:17:38,960 --> 02:17:40,420
That's like a health hazard.

1702
02:17:40,420 --> 02:17:45,880
You know in Arizona, if your apartment manager doesn't fix

1703
02:17:45,880 --> 02:17:47,900
your air conditioning in your apartment, you can take them

1704
02:17:47,900 --> 02:17:49,980
to court for it.

1705
02:17:49,980 --> 02:17:53,100
And I wouldn't be surprised if you could do it here.

1706
02:17:53,100 --> 02:17:55,700
And seriously here, I mean, I honestly would have grounds

1707
02:17:55,700 --> 02:18:00,660
for negligence, because there is a statute that's referred

1708
02:18:00,660 --> 02:18:02,340
to as duty of utmost care.

1709
02:18:02,340 --> 02:18:11,220
And see, I know this because I'm taking business law right now, so don't fuck with me.

1710
02:18:11,220 --> 02:18:17,340
But no, it's especially like for hotels, for people who run facilities, there's a duty

1711
02:18:17,340 --> 02:18:24,160
of utmost care to provide services to tenants, to guests, you know, that they need to make

1712
02:18:24,160 --> 02:18:28,740
sure that they provide a place that's going to be safe to live, safe to exist, you know,

1713
02:18:28,740 --> 02:18:35,100
to operate in, and this is not, you know, safe. You know, when it gets up that hot and

1714
02:18:35,100 --> 02:18:40,620
there's no way to keep cool, then that's dangerous. It's getting bad.

1715
02:18:40,620 --> 02:18:47,180
Leave my foot alone.

1716
02:18:47,180 --> 02:18:57,620
Another, um, F.U. goes toward, uh, American River College. And this is why. Alright, for

1717
02:18:57,620 --> 02:19:00,740
For anyone who's been paying attention to my live journal, there's been the saga of

1718
02:19:00,740 --> 02:19:02,060
my student loan check.

1719
02:19:02,060 --> 02:19:06,380
And see, I work for my lender, so I know where my money is.

1720
02:19:06,380 --> 02:19:08,740
I know when my funds have been disbursed.

1721
02:19:08,740 --> 02:19:13,500
I know how to do your job, financial aid department at ARC.

1722
02:19:13,500 --> 02:19:16,500
I could do your job blindfolded.

1723
02:19:16,500 --> 02:19:23,100
So when I'm told that my check is mailed out last Friday, and it's, you know, I check the

1724
02:19:23,100 --> 02:19:28,340
every day I'm not meaning last Friday as in two days ago I'm meaning the week

1725
02:19:28,340 --> 02:19:38,220
before it does not take seven days to mail a check in town okay maybe two but

1726
02:19:38,220 --> 02:19:44,060
not in Carmichael when ARC is six minutes from my house and the post office

1727
02:19:44,060 --> 02:19:50,780
is six minutes from both ARC and my house no this is just it so I'm gonna

1728
02:19:50,780 --> 02:19:57,620
call them on Tuesday and say excuse me bitches if my money isn't here within

1729
02:19:57,620 --> 02:20:01,980
the next two business days give me my money your asses are getting reported to

1730
02:20:01,980 --> 02:20:05,820
the Department of Education and you know what they will do to you they will pull

1731
02:20:05,820 --> 02:20:15,420
your funding oh okay I vented that's like been my rage for the week yeah you

1732
02:20:15,420 --> 02:20:20,220
forgot it was a three-hour show here for a minute yeah I just had a build-up of

1733
02:20:20,220 --> 02:20:27,220
rage and no I feel better. You feel better? Yeah I feel better. What do you have to say?

1734
02:20:27,500 --> 02:20:33,260
My foot says get this thing away from me bitch. Oh we found the third mic, scary. Moving on

1735
02:20:33,260 --> 02:20:40,260
let's go to Loki and Loki's FUs of the week. Yeah I'm starting to get a little dizzy, that's

1736
02:20:40,260 --> 02:20:43,960
uh... yeah

1737
02:20:43,960 --> 02:20:47,520
I'm starting to get a little dizzy, that's cool

1738
02:20:47,520 --> 02:20:51,600
now first F.U. goes to my stupid cabinet in the god damn I-Pack 2 for not working

1739
02:20:51,600 --> 02:20:55,640
I don't even know why, because it works for like two seconds, or like, well maybe a little longer

1740
02:20:55,640 --> 02:20:58,800
two seconds, but like 30 seconds or like half a song in DDR

1741
02:20:58,800 --> 02:21:02,240
and it just stops working for no reason, and I don't know why, I thought it was

1742
02:21:02,240 --> 02:21:04,800
conflicting with the I-Pack 4 that I had in there, but

1743
02:21:04,800 --> 02:21:08,200
no, that's not the case because I unplugged the other one, and it still breaks

1744
02:21:08,200 --> 02:21:16,700
So apparently, my shitty solder job that I did on it, um, didn't work, so I need to, um, I don't know, get a new one, I guess.

1745
02:21:16,700 --> 02:21:20,700
Maybe it's because it shares the name with a crappy Mac it off the computer.

1746
02:21:20,700 --> 02:21:23,700
Oh, oh, I'm sorry, I forgot there's a Mac lever in here.

1747
02:21:23,700 --> 02:21:25,700
I'm gonna go run and hide now.

1748
02:21:25,700 --> 02:21:29,700
Oh yeah, I'm coming after you, and I'm gonna clock you over here with my iPod.

1749
02:21:29,700 --> 02:21:36,700
Fuck you to the new, um, iMacs, because, um, well, you can make them look prettier, but they're still gonna suck.

1750
02:21:36,700 --> 02:21:39,700
I see you can make them look prettier, but they're still gonna suck.

1751
02:21:39,700 --> 02:21:42,700
Dude, what is this? Like, crap on the Mac fan bay?

1752
02:21:42,700 --> 02:21:48,700
Sorry, it's just, it's no fair to you, because you happen to have a bunch of IBM freaks here, so...

1753
02:21:48,700 --> 02:21:52,700
You know what, if I had $3,000, I'd love to buy it.

1754
02:21:52,700 --> 02:21:57,700
What the hell is the I in the iMac and iPod? What the hell does i mean?

1755
02:21:57,700 --> 02:21:59,700
Internet or something, I don't know, what?

1756
02:21:59,700 --> 02:22:03,700
Like, I don't know how to use computers, so I'd buy this piece of shit. Mac.

1757
02:22:03,700 --> 02:22:07,700
The opinions expressed on this show by Loki.

1758
02:22:07,700 --> 02:22:15,700
Seriously, I think Apple computers are for people that don't know how to use computers, but think that pretty computers are good.

1759
02:22:15,700 --> 02:22:23,700
Loki is very lucky. He's far across the room from me right now, but he's not far enough to miss being hit in the head by a soda bottle or something.

1760
02:22:23,700 --> 02:22:26,820
now now now now now we have

1761
02:22:26,820 --> 02:22:30,220
and defense and Apple I

1762
02:22:30,220 --> 02:22:34,420
played on an Apple II computer and I played a lot of kicks on that loadrunner

1763
02:22:34,420 --> 02:22:35,380
so okay

1764
02:22:35,380 --> 02:22:39,940
I forgot without Apple we would not have had Oregon Trail represent

1765
02:22:39,940 --> 02:22:44,380
yeah or the first version of Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego

1766
02:22:44,380 --> 02:22:48,660
or or Odell Lake yeah I was gonna say Odell Lake

1767
02:22:48,660 --> 02:23:02,660
My first computer was a Mac, and it came in that little box with the 5 inch screen, and I played a lot of Where in the World was Carmen Sandiego on that thing.

1768
02:23:02,660 --> 02:23:12,660
Oh my god, and you know, who needs to upgrade my computer or even work on it? Because I can't get to it because god damn it, the monitor and the computer are the same damn thing!

1769
02:23:12,660 --> 02:23:23,660
My first computer was a Texas Instruments computer, where I spent five hours programming in BASIC to watch a little ball bounce back and forth across the screen and change color.

1770
02:23:23,660 --> 02:23:31,660
And I forgot about Max's contribution to the first person shooter realm, Marathon, because that game is so much better than Quake and Unreal any day.

1771
02:23:31,660 --> 02:23:36,660
Okay, those games weren't even out yet when Marathon came out, man.

1772
02:23:36,660 --> 02:23:38,660
Whatever.

1773
02:23:38,660 --> 02:23:42,660
I can go on for hours about how bad Apple sucks, but I don't think I will.

1774
02:23:42,660 --> 02:23:44,660
Let's talk about Microsoft.

1775
02:23:44,660 --> 02:23:49,660
Microsoft sucks too, because Service Pack 2 is lame.

1776
02:23:49,660 --> 02:23:52,660
At least he's an equal opportunity offender.

1777
02:23:52,660 --> 02:24:00,660
They said Microsoft Windows is never going to be secure until about 2011, 2015.

1778
02:24:00,660 --> 02:24:03,660
Well, thank you for warning me. I'm buying your piece of shit now.

1779
02:24:03,660 --> 02:24:07,700
Oh wait, no, I'm not buying your piece of shit now. I'm downloading it for free. Ha ha ha

1780
02:24:08,700 --> 02:24:13,440
Anyways, you know by then the hackers will have new, you know, things it doesn't matter

1781
02:24:13,440 --> 02:24:19,480
It's just you know, their software's gonna suck no matter what they have it's all we have. Okay?

1782
02:24:20,960 --> 02:24:22,960
That's what you get when you outsource

1783
02:24:23,340 --> 02:24:28,680
You know those people in yet. They're just not sharp as those people in you know America. No, wait, I'm wrong

1784
02:24:28,680 --> 02:24:30,680
They are sharper than them

1785
02:24:30,680 --> 02:24:39,680
Anyways, um, no, other than that, um, really not anything else I'm mad at other than, um,

1786
02:24:39,680 --> 02:24:44,440
well, not anyone being accused last night because there, I don't know where the hell

1787
02:24:44,440 --> 02:24:45,440
people were in Vacaville.

1788
02:24:45,440 --> 02:24:49,640
No, no, no, I'm not talking about you, I'm talking about the Vacaville folk that normally

1789
02:24:49,640 --> 02:24:50,640
are there.

1790
02:24:50,640 --> 02:24:51,640
Oh, is that normal?

1791
02:24:51,640 --> 02:24:52,640
You know, there's no skater cowboy, no anything.

1792
02:24:52,640 --> 02:24:54,520
Oh yeah, no skater cowboy.

1793
02:24:54,520 --> 02:24:56,800
It was just, no one there.

1794
02:24:56,800 --> 02:25:03,840
like oh my god they left Vacaville that's scary anyways were there any cows

1795
02:25:03,840 --> 02:25:12,720
there no I don't know I think they're on vacation too but yeah that that's pretty

1796
02:25:12,720 --> 02:25:31,020
Pretty much all I've got right now is just those few things and yeah, I'm done.

1797
02:25:31,020 --> 02:25:36,580
No things just keep getting worse, no actually it's been an okay week but I would just first

1798
02:25:36,580 --> 02:25:40,020
like to say you know what, if I was going to say FU to Apple that's because I was a

1799
02:25:40,020 --> 02:25:44,220
Commodore 64 fan back in the day but you know but I have been I've been

1800
02:25:44,220 --> 02:25:48,860
contemplating buying a Mac laptop I am NOT gonna listen to Loki I kind of want

1801
02:25:48,860 --> 02:25:53,580
one anyway cuz laptops are different I think laptops are different because you

1802
02:25:53,580 --> 02:25:57,980
can't upgrade even a PC laptop very easily so not very easily you can put up

1803
02:25:57,980 --> 02:26:01,860
like a memory upgrade that's the main thing you can do I want one I want one

1804
02:26:01,860 --> 02:26:10,280
where otherwise an F you I don't know an F you to the fact that I'm leaving

1805
02:26:10,280 --> 02:26:16,200
again in just over a week and that makes me sad and I don't want to leave again

1806
02:26:16,200 --> 02:26:20,240
for two weeks especially with everything that's kind of going on back home I don't

1807
02:26:20,240 --> 02:26:24,640
want to get a lot of money I could get stars you get paid in money and sex yeah

1808
02:26:24,640 --> 02:26:29,920
I'm on the other hand at the same time I shut up Nellie at the same time like

1809
02:26:29,920 --> 02:26:33,020
Like when I do go, the company pays for all my food, so like that'll be extra money that

1810
02:26:33,020 --> 02:26:35,020
I can spend on video games!

1811
02:26:35,020 --> 02:26:39,980
No, go ahead and finish the FUs, I completely forgot about that.

1812
02:26:39,980 --> 02:26:43,980
I guess I'm done since the rest of you are going to take all the time.

1813
02:26:43,980 --> 02:26:44,980
Ooh.

1814
02:26:44,980 --> 02:26:45,980
Aww.

1815
02:26:45,980 --> 02:26:53,080
No, no, no, this wasn't about FUs of the Week, this is, I won a trip to San Diego in October.

1816
02:26:53,080 --> 02:26:58,000
I'm going to be staying at the Hotel Del Coronado

1817
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:02,380
which is basically a fucking expensive hotel, which is also haunted

1818
02:27:02,380 --> 02:27:07,680
and uh... take your germanium, I mean your portal to hell, I mean your...

1819
02:27:07,680 --> 02:27:08,980
Shut up!

1820
02:27:08,980 --> 02:27:12,800
I'll never get past security on the plane. They'll think it's a bomb.

1821
02:27:12,800 --> 02:27:13,800
Oh, nevermind.

1822
02:27:13,800 --> 02:27:18,760
What is that bomb you have? It's not a bomb, you said bomb, you're a terrorist!

1823
02:27:18,760 --> 02:27:22,400
Okay, that's all I have. But yeah, Hotel Del Coronado.

1824
02:27:22,400 --> 02:27:27,480
Awesome place in San Diego. All expenses paid by my work. Awesome. Yummy

1825
02:27:28,580 --> 02:27:31,980
OLR stalker fans now you know where to find them. All right, moving on

1826
02:27:32,900 --> 02:27:36,380
Let's go to float walk with his FUs of the week

1827
02:27:37,380 --> 02:27:44,180
Lordy, well, I'm gonna keep this actually pretty short. First FU of the week goes to all the people over

1828
02:27:44,700 --> 02:27:50,400
there in Japan's board to say that the people who are creating steps for Ultramic 2

1829
02:27:50,400 --> 02:27:54,000
who don't deserve to be doing any of it.

1830
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:57,600
Oh, like you people do over on the board. Come on.

1831
02:27:57,600 --> 02:28:00,400
It's funny because one of the biggest arguments is,

1832
02:28:00,400 --> 02:28:04,400
well, I've never seen any of these guys ranked on the Simphile community.

1833
02:28:04,400 --> 02:28:06,000
I'm still here thinking, what the hell?

1834
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:07,800
That should be a credit.

1835
02:28:07,800 --> 02:28:09,400
Yeah, exactly.

1836
02:28:09,400 --> 02:28:11,000
I'm still here thinking, OK, wonderful.

1837
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:17,700
90% of Simphiles I've seen are 1,100 finger step patterns.

1838
02:28:17,700 --> 02:28:22,360
I mean, okay, you try putting 200 pounds of pressure on those fingers and doing that,

1839
02:28:22,360 --> 02:28:25,900
then maybe, just maybe, I'll give you a little bit of credit there.

1840
02:28:25,900 --> 02:28:31,340
And like, you know, meanwhile, you're doing, you know, having a real life and making money

1841
02:28:31,340 --> 02:28:35,700
doing your job, where these other people who have no jobs are sitting there doing nothing

1842
02:28:35,700 --> 02:28:38,300
but making steps and putting them on communities and stuff.

1843
02:28:38,300 --> 02:28:41,700
Hey, I know there's a lot of probably a few cool, you know, people there online doing

1844
02:28:41,700 --> 02:28:45,420
these steps, but seriously, you've got a life you need to take care of first.

1845
02:28:45,420 --> 02:28:49,740
uh... i mean you got all that going on in our thinking with all the ed to make

1846
02:28:49,740 --> 02:28:50,660
it simple

1847
02:28:50,660 --> 02:28:53,660
guess what you're just make your basically played two d x there you know

1848
02:28:53,660 --> 02:28:56,820
yeah it was the other day you know i don't want to know i'm on

1849
02:28:56,820 --> 02:28:58,300
arrow smashing

1850
02:28:58,300 --> 02:29:01,460
uh... you know it is and noticed they weren't we don't know we're talking about

1851
02:29:01,460 --> 02:29:03,140
were under qualified for it

1852
02:29:03,140 --> 02:29:04,940
i'd i could go off about

1853
02:29:04,940 --> 02:29:06,380
how could you know we

1854
02:29:06,380 --> 02:29:08,780
you know we are in all of that but you know it played a m

1855
02:29:08,780 --> 02:29:10,020
that they are a lot of it

1856
02:29:10,020 --> 02:29:11,200
but already

1857
02:29:11,200 --> 02:29:14,100
uh... i mean i think you know what the game drops i think people are

1858
02:29:14,100 --> 02:29:15,780
definitely going to be pleasantly surprised.

1859
02:29:15,780 --> 02:29:18,340
And you know what though, people are still going to hate, same thing I was telling Seeker

1860
02:29:18,340 --> 02:29:21,620
when he was here, I said, you know what, no matter what, when the game comes out, people

1861
02:29:21,620 --> 02:29:26,140
are going to hate the steps that whoever those folks at Konami put in the steps did put in

1862
02:29:26,140 --> 02:29:30,620
there, because it happens every single time. And damn right those people are going to bitch,

1863
02:29:30,620 --> 02:29:32,780
because they didn't do the steps, they're going to say, I'm going to make something

1864
02:29:32,780 --> 02:29:33,780
better.

1865
02:29:33,780 --> 02:29:37,940
It's funny, it just cracked me up, because I remember stumbling upon like an edit, you

1866
02:29:37,940 --> 02:29:44,020
know, vault online, and their headline is called, who needs Konami original steps anyway.

1867
02:29:44,020 --> 02:29:48,620
And oh man, the people around the office were ready to throw down with the maker that side.

1868
02:29:48,620 --> 02:29:51,020
But you know, it's all good. You know, we're rich. They ain't.

1869
02:29:51,020 --> 02:29:56,020
Scoreboard. Look at the scoreboard. Our scoreboard says we got paychecks.

1870
02:29:56,020 --> 02:30:01,020
And um, last nephew of the week just goes to work.

1871
02:30:01,020 --> 02:30:04,020
I know, yeah, you guys are thinking, why should I bitch about working at Konami?

1872
02:30:04,020 --> 02:30:06,520
Guess what? I have to work tomorrow for Labor Day.

1873
02:30:06,520 --> 02:30:13,020
And not on a fun game at that. But, that said, you know, that's just a fright.

1874
02:30:13,020 --> 02:30:18,020
You know, I got people who want to spend time with me, you know, I got a lady who needs some lovin' and, you know, what happens?

1875
02:30:18,020 --> 02:30:23,020
I gotta leave her in the morning, man. Like, you know, I'm just, uh, you know, John Depp picked her up and, you know, dumped her off, man.

1876
02:30:23,020 --> 02:30:25,020
Well, what's up with that?

1877
02:30:26,020 --> 02:30:27,020
Huh.

1878
02:30:28,020 --> 02:30:30,020
You know, it ain't really like that.

1879
02:30:30,020 --> 02:30:31,020
Preach it, brother.

1880
02:30:31,020 --> 02:30:33,020
Having to work in the morning sucks.

1881
02:30:33,020 --> 02:30:37,020
Oh yeah, and one last few. Goes to Order of Chaos, actually.

1882
02:30:37,020 --> 02:30:40,020
Sure, you know, people say you shouldn't crack on your own. Well, guess what?

1883
02:30:40,020 --> 02:30:48,520
Ever since he posted that rubbernecking post of all the car accidents, every day I've commuted to work, I've had to be stopped because of, like, traffic accidents happening.

1884
02:30:48,520 --> 02:30:53,520
So he's made my commute, like, half an hour worse every single day ever since he posted that two weeks ago.

1885
02:30:53,520 --> 02:30:58,520
Thanks a whole hell of a lot for nothing. You get no Oreos. Bye.

1886
02:30:58,520 --> 02:30:59,520
Wow.

1887
02:30:59,520 --> 02:31:01,520
I love you anyway.

1888
02:31:01,520 --> 02:31:06,520
So, special lady, shark's girl, do you have any FUs you'd like to give us tonight?

1897
02:32:00,480 --> 02:32:03,200
we'll see what happens well cable in Sacramento is just better than all the

1898
02:32:03,200 --> 02:32:07,200
I might want to research that.

1899
02:32:07,200 --> 02:32:11,200
Yeah, it's looking at the internet.

1900
02:32:11,200 --> 02:32:15,200
I created the internet.

1901
02:32:15,200 --> 02:32:19,200
Alright, and um...

1902
02:32:19,200 --> 02:32:23,200
I don't know. I guess that's it.

1903
02:32:23,200 --> 02:32:27,200
Because I can't think of anything at the moment.

1904
02:32:27,200 --> 02:32:31,200
Alright, let's go on to explicit.

1905
02:32:31,200 --> 02:32:38,200
I want to give an F to Texas Hold'em. God damn it. I need some cards that goes at least

1906
02:32:44,440 --> 02:32:49,960
an 8, 9, 10, Jack Queen King at least. All I'm getting is nothing but 2s and 3s. How

1907
02:32:49,960 --> 02:32:54,080
the hell can you win an actual Texas Hold'em game with just those cards?

1908
02:32:54,080 --> 02:32:55,480
Someone's cheating.

1909
02:32:55,480 --> 02:32:58,400
Play 2-7 off suit. Best hand in the game.

1910
02:32:58,400 --> 02:33:04,400
Yeah, but, fuck. I'm not wasting no fucking forty percent.

1911
02:33:04,400 --> 02:33:08,400
Another F.E. goes to my family for forcing me to play the damn game.

1912
02:33:08,400 --> 02:33:11,400
Goddammit, I told you I'm not wasting more money.

1913
02:33:11,400 --> 02:33:16,400
I only play games that I know I'm going to win money on, like Blackjack.

1914
02:33:16,400 --> 02:33:19,400
I get two hundred on cash for getting that.

1915
02:33:19,400 --> 02:33:23,400
Takes a total of them, ah, no wins whatsoever.

1916
02:33:23,400 --> 02:33:30,400
I was trying to just say fuck you to the cars itself for giving me the bad luck.

1917
02:33:31,400 --> 02:33:37,400
And fuck you to some lady throwing a damn beer bottle in my head.

1918
02:33:37,400 --> 02:33:38,400
What?

1919
02:33:38,400 --> 02:33:42,400
I just mentioned this before.

1920
02:33:42,400 --> 02:33:45,400
That's just her way of saying I love you.

1921
02:33:45,400 --> 02:33:46,400
Whoa!

1922
02:33:46,400 --> 02:33:47,400
No, no, no, no.

1923
02:33:47,400 --> 02:33:49,400
Yeah, she wants to share a drink.

1924
02:33:49,400 --> 02:33:51,400
Nothing says I love you like a beer.

1925
02:33:51,400 --> 02:33:59,400
a drink. I got hit in the head right here. Aww, dude. Got hit in the top of my head,

1926
02:33:59,400 --> 02:34:06,880
dammit. You should have been like, aww, you want a drink, huh, bitch? Beer tastes good.

1927
02:34:06,880 --> 02:34:12,400
I was just waving like this. You didn't have to put a damn beer bottle at me. Perhaps you

1928
02:34:12,400 --> 02:34:20,400
were thinking taste great and she really meant less filling. Oh, yeah. That's not a word.

1929
02:34:20,400 --> 02:34:22,400
Alright, anything else?

1930
02:34:22,400 --> 02:34:26,400
F you for some kids pissing on my Toyota Corolla S-Tire!

1931
02:34:26,400 --> 02:34:27,400
What?

1932
02:34:27,400 --> 02:34:28,400
Yes!

1933
02:34:29,400 --> 02:34:30,400
Dude!

1934
02:34:31,400 --> 02:34:32,400
Holy crap!

1935
02:34:32,400 --> 02:34:35,400
You know, waving is the first step to rape.

1936
02:34:37,400 --> 02:34:39,400
She was only defending herself.

1937
02:34:41,400 --> 02:34:42,400
There's a reason why there's porta-

1938
02:34:42,400 --> 02:34:51,740
There's a fucking reason why there's porter potties and bathrooms.

1939
02:34:51,740 --> 02:34:54,860
You can't piss on tires, they don't clean the tires.

1940
02:34:54,860 --> 02:35:04,380
If you do the security up at the rage for breaking up a battle and stuff, and for breaking

1941
02:35:04,380 --> 02:35:08,460
up people freak dancing in there, this guy's gonna have a nice boner by accident after

1942
02:35:08,460 --> 02:35:10,020
some girl's freaking on me.

1943
02:35:10,020 --> 02:35:13,020
There's no fucking way I'm raping her!

1944
02:35:13,020 --> 02:35:17,020
Remember that part about TMI being in the show? Remember that part?

1945
02:35:17,020 --> 02:35:20,020
Raping is a crime, but freakdancing is not.

1946
02:35:22,020 --> 02:35:23,020
Oh, man.

1947
02:35:23,020 --> 02:35:24,020
Alright, anything else?

1948
02:35:24,020 --> 02:35:26,020
Uh, let's just say, dude, be continued.

1949
02:35:26,020 --> 02:35:27,020
Alright.

1950
02:35:27,020 --> 02:35:29,020
There's too much, there's too much.

1951
02:35:29,020 --> 02:35:30,020
Thank you, Sal.

1952
02:35:30,020 --> 02:35:34,020
Uh, do you really want to go there?

1953
02:35:34,020 --> 02:35:37,020
Say what you want, buddy. Say whatever you want.

1954
02:35:37,020 --> 02:35:50,020
Hey, uh, all I have to say is big F you to people who want to fucking, miserable people who have made their lives fucking horrible on their own and want to fucking bring everybody else down because they're fucking immature little fucking pricks.

1955
02:35:50,020 --> 02:35:59,020
You go ahead and do it without us. Go ahead, drive your fucking car off the road and kill yourself because no one's gonna fucking miss you. Don't bring us down because of your shit.

1956
02:35:59,020 --> 02:36:05,520
And I don't need to really go into detail. It's kind of a personal thing, but it's been a fucking rocky weekend.

1957
02:36:05,520 --> 02:36:11,520
And they have to understand, to open a door, it does not require your fists going through the door, but there's a handle there.

1958
02:36:11,520 --> 02:36:12,520
Okay, yeah.

1959
02:36:12,520 --> 02:36:17,520
And yes, goddammit, Diet Dr. Pepper does taste like regular Dr. Pepper.

1960
02:36:20,520 --> 02:36:22,520
No sacrifices here, Rens.

1961
02:36:23,520 --> 02:36:24,020
Yeah.

1962
02:36:24,020 --> 02:36:27,520
Uh, I think we have a segment, or a little subject for a Wednesday show, right?

1963
02:36:27,520 --> 02:36:31,520
Alright, uh, Gypsy Wolf, do you have any FUs?

1964
02:36:31,520 --> 02:36:34,520
It's brilliant. Okay, FU to Sacramento for not having any decent clubs.

1965
02:36:34,520 --> 02:36:37,520
I haven't found one yet, I still have yet to find one.

1966
02:36:37,520 --> 02:36:40,520
I've been to a couple, most of them are either really ghetto or really teeny-boppers.

1967
02:36:40,520 --> 02:36:41,520
Have you been to Paces?

1968
02:36:41,520 --> 02:36:42,520
No.

1969
02:36:42,520 --> 02:36:45,520
If you can put up with a gayity, it's a lot of fun.

1970
02:36:45,520 --> 02:36:46,520
I just haven't tried it yet.

1971
02:36:46,520 --> 02:36:48,520
And there's sexy men there. I'll take you there sometime.

1972
02:36:50,520 --> 02:36:51,520
My car just opened.

1973
02:36:51,520 --> 02:36:54,520
I have not been to a car. I haven't had time.

1974
02:36:54,520 --> 02:36:55,520
Anything else?

1975
02:36:55,520 --> 02:36:57,520
Wait, no, nothing else.

1976
02:37:25,520 --> 02:37:27,580
Blasphemous for me to say it, I know.

1977
02:37:27,580 --> 02:37:29,380
The FU is for the game being too short.

1978
02:37:29,380 --> 02:37:34,620
I'm almost done, over 90 stars, and only at 22 hours, and FU to parties not wanting my

1979
02:37:34,620 --> 02:37:40,740

1980
02:37:40,740 --> 02:37:46,120
Karma Titan says, he wants to get political, he says, FU George Bush, Bush lied, people

1981
02:37:46,120 --> 02:37:47,120

1982

FU I lived through 110 plus, all freaking day and it ain't that bad.

1983
02:37:51,180 --> 02:37:58,860

Ninz FU to my job and the people I work with,

1988
02:38:13,960 --> 02:38:17,140
the job is getting to be bullshit and people are getting more stupid

1989
02:38:17,140 --> 02:38:20,640
Ninz also says FU to my computer, I had to format earlier and of course there were a

1990
02:38:20,640 --> 02:38:23,300
problems during the format.

1991
02:38:23,300 --> 02:38:27,580
DDR Nemesis says, F you to Floatwalk and Dancer X for giving clues that are too

1992
02:38:27,580 --> 02:38:29,580
fucking hard.

1993
02:38:29,580 --> 02:38:34,540
It would be really easy clues if you had paid attention in school.

1994
02:38:34,540 --> 02:38:40,980
I don't know, the more you scream, the harder it gets. Ooh, there you go.

1995
02:38:40,980 --> 02:38:44,220
Wait a second, isn't that what you told me last night?

1996
02:38:44,220 --> 02:38:45,220
I was just gonna...

1997
02:38:45,220 --> 02:38:46,820
Damn it, you stole...

1998
02:38:46,820 --> 02:38:53,820
I was just going to say it's like sex, the more you relax, the easier it will get, anyway.

1999
02:38:54,820 --> 02:38:58,780
BlackDevilRx says, you know Loki is really a good guy, so F you to the guy who threw

Okay, you need to realize something about me.

02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:54,000
Oh, I'll give John Fields one. FU to Construction on Highways that should have been finished years ago.

2035
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:59,000
Okay, that's it. No more FUs. We're done with the segment. It's done. It's over. Complete. Finished.

2036
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:04,000
Alright. Oh, God, that was a long FU segment tonight. Shit.

2037
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:07,620
shit

2038
02:42:07,620 --> 02:42:11,380
i think we need to talk about some like actual bimani news at this point is

2039
02:42:11,380 --> 02:42:16,980
is there anything else we could uh... bimani news what's that bimani crap

2040
02:42:16,980 --> 02:42:18,860
i forgot what that was

2041
02:42:18,860 --> 02:42:21,940
cuz we haven't talked about it in a long time

2042
02:42:21,940 --> 02:42:23,780
uh...

2043
02:42:23,780 --> 02:42:28,180
well it's not really bimani news but it's dance mania news and as we all know

2044
02:42:28,180 --> 02:42:30,300
the japanese

2045
02:42:30,300 --> 02:42:35,540
Folks always get a lot of their songs from the dance media CDs. There is a CD calling called

2046
02:42:36,220 --> 02:42:39,060
Transparadise it was recently released in Japan for

2047
02:42:39,860 --> 02:42:41,340
1995 yen

2048
02:42:41,340 --> 02:42:45,460
Transparadise tracklist isn't here yet. We'll post it to our website soon and

2049
02:42:46,340 --> 02:42:49,900
In not really related to Bemani per se

2050
02:42:49,900 --> 02:42:54,020
But those you guys that play a lot of video games if you were listening to Wednesday's show you heard about

2051
02:42:54,020 --> 02:43:00,020
Acclaim, the video game publisher for such games as Turok, they went bankrupt.

2052
02:43:00,020 --> 02:43:02,020
Acclaim is gone.

2053
02:43:04,020 --> 02:43:08,020
I remember back in the days when Acclaim was cool, back in the days when we had NBA Jam.

2054
02:43:09,020 --> 02:43:13,020
I say a moment of silence for Acclaim.

2055
02:43:19,020 --> 02:43:20,020
Okay.

2056
02:43:20,020 --> 02:43:26,020
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Did you say a moment of silence for acclaim?

2057
02:43:26,020 --> 02:43:33,020
You know, I have a problem with the volume of my voice. No, I can't do that because that'd be too obvious.

2058
02:43:33,020 --> 02:43:43,020
I liked NBA Jam, it was awesome. You know, I would always kick ass on it, and it was really cool.

2059
02:43:43,020 --> 02:43:49,020
So, I wish that game was still around though, because I think they got rid of it, but whatever.

2060
02:43:49,020 --> 02:43:56,020
Yeah. Anyway, let's give the folks in the chat room another chance to guess at that news.

2061
02:43:56,020 --> 02:44:01,020
I hope someone gets it. I want to play this song. Don't let Dancer X have another victory, you guys.

2062
02:44:01,020 --> 02:44:02,020
You need to get it.

2063
02:44:02,020 --> 02:44:12,020
I will say this. As I was scrolling back through the text of everyone in the chat room, someone got half of the clue correct.

2064
02:44:12,020 --> 02:44:13,020
Like, dead on.

2065
02:44:13,020 --> 02:44:16,020
Dope. But you gotta send it over a private message.

2066
02:44:16,020 --> 02:44:22,020
I mean, as they were thinking aloud, they actually stumbled upon a key part of the answer.

2067
02:44:22,020 --> 02:44:28,020
Alright, well, you better send those guesses right now to Sky in the chat room with your guess.

2068
02:44:28,020 --> 02:44:36,020
Meanwhile, Loki has a song he would like to play for all you guys, and I have to yell at everyone a little bit

2069
02:44:36,020 --> 02:44:42,020
because we've been trying to get you guys to participate by naming this remix in our forum.

2070
02:44:42,020 --> 02:44:43,020
To hell with you people.

2071
02:44:43,020 --> 02:44:49,220
gotten like maybe like two guesses or two suggestions that weren't that great so

2072
02:44:49,220 --> 02:44:53,260
some of you guys said though you were like we need to hear it one more time

2073
02:44:53,260 --> 02:44:57,420
before we can give it a name so fine here you go your last chance to hear

2074
02:44:57,420 --> 02:45:01,820
this mix and give it a name fair enough yeah all right so I already have a name

2075
02:45:01,820 --> 02:45:06,980
if you don't pick one all right so Loki with a remix of radical faith as yet

2076
02:45:06,980 --> 02:45:11,340
unnamed so go to our forums www.orangetownsworded.com look for the thread

2077
02:45:11,340 --> 02:45:16,100
and Bimani discussion and guess and give it a title, whatever you want.

2078
02:45:16,100 --> 02:45:21,300
And Seagurd Rocks, as cute as that was, is not a good remix title.

2079
02:45:21,300 --> 02:45:23,220
That would be for like an Echo Image remix or something.

2080
02:45:23,220 --> 02:45:24,220
All right.

2081
02:45:24,220 --> 02:45:25,220
All right.

2082
02:45:25,220 --> 02:45:26,220
Here it is.

2083
02:45:26,220 --> 02:45:27,820
Anything else you want to say about this remix of Radical Faith,

2084
02:45:27,820 --> 02:45:28,820
Loki, that you did?

2085
02:45:28,820 --> 02:45:29,820
Brand new?

2086
02:45:29,820 --> 02:45:30,820
No, not really.

2087
02:45:30,820 --> 02:45:31,820
All right.

2088
02:45:31,820 --> 02:45:35,180
And again, we're open for guesses, and I've gotten one guess so far from

2089
02:45:35,180 --> 02:45:40,040
Seagurd, and he's guessing, is it Love Love Shine?

2090
02:45:40,040 --> 02:45:42,040
No, this song is not Love Love Shine.

2091
02:45:42,040 --> 02:45:43,040
And you can't guess, you dumbass!

2092
02:45:43,040 --> 02:45:47,040
You should have guessed the same thing you guessed the first two times, because you were right the first two times.

2093
02:45:49,040 --> 02:45:51,040
Alright, here it is. Loki's brand new remix of Radical Fate.

2094
02:45:51,040 --> 02:45:52,040
I want some... no.

2095
02:45:52,040 --> 02:45:53,040
Name this.

2096
02:45:53,040 --> 02:45:56,040
I'm not gonna... I'm just gonna shut up now because I'll just give it away.

2097
02:45:56,040 --> 02:45:59,040
All right, www.orangeletree.com, forums, name it.

2098
02:48:26,040 --> 02:48:56,020
Very sexy from Loki, Radical Phase.

2099
02:48:56,020 --> 02:49:02,020
an unnamed remix, and I gave you guys the URL to post to on our forum, so...

2100
02:49:02,020 --> 02:49:05,020
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm a little loud. Sorry, sorry.

2101
02:49:05,020 --> 02:49:06,020
Yeah, quit yelling.

2102
02:49:06,020 --> 02:49:09,020
Okay, Jamie still has, like, a raging headache right now.

2103
02:49:09,020 --> 02:49:11,020
Alright.

2104
02:49:11,020 --> 02:49:14,020
And explicit as a raging boner.

2105
02:49:14,020 --> 02:49:15,020
What?

2106
02:49:15,020 --> 02:49:17,020
And you noticed.

2107
02:49:17,020 --> 02:49:21,020
Well, no, he was saying earlier in a story that freak dancing is not illegal.

2108
02:49:21,020 --> 02:49:22,020
It's like...

2109
02:49:22,020 --> 02:49:23,020
Raging boner, I don't know.

2110
02:49:23,020 --> 02:49:25,020
It's like, I don't know, remember realultimatepower.net?

2111
02:49:25,020 --> 02:49:27,020
No, sorry.

2112
02:49:27,020 --> 02:49:29,020
This script is awesome.

2113
02:49:31,020 --> 02:49:35,020
Again, as a reminder, please don't send me your suggestions.

2114
02:49:35,020 --> 02:49:38,020
I should say, over private message, you want to go to the forums and post those.

2115
02:49:38,020 --> 02:49:43,020
That link I posted in the chatroom that says suggest here with a big arrow.

2116
02:49:43,020 --> 02:49:45,020
Yeah, click on that.

2117
02:49:45,020 --> 02:49:49,020
Don't talk condescendingly to your listeners.

2118
02:49:49,020 --> 02:49:51,020
I know.

2119
02:49:51,020 --> 02:49:55,520
And now you've heard someone speaking with you.

2120
02:49:55,520 --> 02:49:56,580
Way to go, Loki.

2121
02:49:56,580 --> 02:49:57,760
Way to go.

2122
02:49:57,760 --> 02:49:59,300
You're off our listeners, Loki.

2123
02:49:59,300 --> 02:50:00,660
Way to go, Loki.

2124
02:50:00,660 --> 02:50:01,720
You're off our listeners.

2125
02:50:01,720 --> 02:50:02,720
That's right.

2126
02:50:02,720 --> 02:50:05,720
You know what, Loki?

2127
02:50:05,720 --> 02:50:07,000
Your music sucks.

2128
02:50:07,000 --> 02:50:08,360
You should never...

2129
02:50:08,360 --> 02:50:10,000
That's right, your music sucks.

2130
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:14,420
You know what, this vacuum sucks.

2131
02:50:14,420 --> 02:50:19,060
Alright, let's talk about the Orange Center radio spinoff shows.

2132
02:50:19,060 --> 02:50:22,920
who always have to plug these at some point during the show. Monday night on our station

2133
02:50:22,920 --> 02:50:28,700
you can hear Diversion, the Bimani remix show. Are you going to do maple syrup shots over

2134
02:50:28,700 --> 02:50:33,260
there, Logie? He has a thing of... Spin off, spin off. He's showing me a thing of Mrs.

2135
02:50:33,260 --> 02:50:37,340
Butterworth's going, Rob, as if like I find Mrs. Butterworth hot or something. Spin off,

2136
02:50:37,340 --> 02:50:42,920
spin off. Oh yeah. Monday night, Diversion, Bimani remixes, 7 o'clock, tune in, love it.

2137
02:50:42,920 --> 02:50:46,700
What's happening on Tuesday night, Jamie? You need to be mixing some Malibu with that

2138
02:50:46,700 --> 02:50:48,700
That happens on Tuesday night?

2139
02:50:48,700 --> 02:50:55,700
No. Tuesday night, pump up the volume. Starring me, the awesome and...

2140
02:50:55,700 --> 02:51:01,700
You know, I went to Game Crazy, and the guy there gave me my official nickname.

2141
02:51:01,700 --> 02:51:04,700
He was asking me what my name was because we were putting in something for some order.

2142
02:51:04,700 --> 02:51:08,700
And I was like, my name is Jamie, the great and terrible.

2143
02:51:08,700 --> 02:51:13,700
And he was like, how about Jamie, the truly awesome and never nice.

2144
02:51:13,700 --> 02:51:14,700
So that's my new official title.

2145
02:51:14,700 --> 02:51:15,700
And never nice.

2146
02:51:15,700 --> 02:51:19,880
I'm never nice. I'm I am officially completely awesome and never nice

2147
02:51:20,840 --> 02:51:22,020
anyway

2148
02:51:22,020 --> 02:51:27,960
My show is on Tuesday, and it's called pump up the volume, and I have a pre-show that starts at 7

2149
02:51:27,960 --> 02:51:30,320
although when I'm really bored it starts earlier than that and

2150
02:51:31,100 --> 02:51:36,620
The show show starts at 730, but because I now have to get my ass up at 5 a.m.. Every morning. I

2151
02:51:38,180 --> 02:51:42,820
My show is usually over right at 1030 unless I'm like really bored, and I'll keep it going

2152
02:51:42,820 --> 02:51:48,240
going. I was supposed to do my show last Tuesday, and I had to do an emergency announcement

2153
02:51:48,240 --> 02:51:54,260
because I had to get my homework done. So, blame my apartment manager for not turning

2154
02:51:54,260 --> 02:52:00,640
on my AC, so I couldn't concentrate on my homework on Monday, so I had to do it on Tuesday.

2155
02:52:00,640 --> 02:52:06,260
As promised, I'm going to be doing overclock remixes, and I'm thinking about marathoning

2156
02:52:06,260 --> 02:52:09,540
another CD. I don't know, maybe Sim and Flow, I don't know.

2157
02:52:09,540 --> 02:52:10,540
Maybe Echo Image.

2158
02:52:10,540 --> 02:52:12,300
The echo image, that's a good idea.

2159
02:52:12,300 --> 02:52:13,700
I don't know, I just, give me ideas.

2160
02:52:13,700 --> 02:52:14,940
I'm dropping the key, oh shit.

2161
02:52:14,940 --> 02:52:15,900
No, you don't got to be doing.

2162
02:52:15,900 --> 02:52:17,500
Oh crap, I just closed the.

2163
02:52:17,500 --> 02:52:21,100
Oh, I think she just out F4'd the chat room.

2164
02:52:21,100 --> 02:52:24,100
That was an accident, I don't even know how I did that.

2165
02:52:25,580 --> 02:52:28,060
And she hasn't even been drinking either, I mean.

2166
02:52:28,060 --> 02:52:28,900
I just.

2167
02:52:30,580 --> 02:52:31,420
Nice.

2168
02:52:32,420 --> 02:52:33,980
Okay, the cam's still going.

2169
02:52:35,060 --> 02:52:38,340
Okay, yeah, if you don't see DarkSakir in the chat room,

2170
02:52:38,340 --> 02:52:39,940
it's all right, she'll be back.

2171
02:52:39,940 --> 02:52:40,940
Where's IRC?

2172
02:52:40,940 --> 02:52:41,940
I think it's over here.

2173
02:52:41,940 --> 02:52:42,940
Okay.

2174
02:52:42,940 --> 02:52:43,940
Well...

2175
02:52:43,940 --> 02:52:44,940
Hey Rob.

2176
02:52:44,940 --> 02:52:45,940
Yes.

2177
02:52:45,940 --> 02:52:46,940
Pick up the flack.

2178
02:52:46,940 --> 02:52:47,940
Quick.

2179
02:52:47,940 --> 02:52:48,940
I'm sorry.

2180
02:52:48,940 --> 02:52:49,940
Yeah, Rob!

2181
02:52:49,940 --> 02:52:52,260
Well, we were gonna go to break, but it's only ten minutes left in the show, so I thought

2182
02:52:52,260 --> 02:52:56,180
actually we'd just go ahead and just kinda skip the break and come back to what we were

2183
02:52:56,180 --> 02:52:57,180
gonna do.

2184
02:52:57,180 --> 02:52:58,180
Wait.

2185
02:52:58,180 --> 02:52:59,180
Wait.

2186
02:52:59,180 --> 02:53:00,180
One more show.

2187
02:53:00,180 --> 02:53:01,180
Huh?

2188
02:53:01,180 --> 02:53:02,180
One more show.

2189
02:53:02,180 --> 02:53:03,180
Oh yeah, I'm sorry.

2190
02:53:03,180 --> 02:53:04,180
Wednesday nights.

2191
02:53:04,180 --> 02:53:05,180
Mikey style, tell us about Wednesday nights.

2192
02:53:05,180 --> 02:53:09,020
Wednesday nights is the night, you know, you're probably like, hey, it's Wednesday night,

2193
02:53:09,020 --> 02:53:12,480

2194
02:53:12,480 --> 02:53:16,280

2195
02:53:16,280 --> 02:53:24,920
radio on live 365 and listen to outside the box because like the name says it's

2196
02:53:24,920 --> 02:53:31,480
quite outside the box even though we talk a lot about boxes I don't know why

2197
02:53:31,480 --> 02:53:36,620
but the main reason why you should listen to show is because I co-host it

2198
02:53:36,620 --> 02:53:40,920
with rice princess you know so it's not just rob all the time because Rob's the

2199
02:53:40,920 --> 02:53:45,740
the queen that always takes over the show you know runs it so please listen

2200
02:53:45,740 --> 02:53:54,140
seven o'clock Wednesday nights we have another guest on the song yeah and I

2201
02:53:54,140 --> 02:53:57,020
definitely want to share something we're almost out of show I really want someone

2202
02:53:57,020 --> 02:54:00,860
to get it so it's an open forum tell the rest for the rest of show send in your

2203
02:54:00,860 --> 02:54:03,860
guesses for the rest of the show and hopefully someone gets it here's what

2204
02:54:03,860 --> 02:54:05,380
What's a jazz guest?

2205
02:54:05,380 --> 02:54:08,620
Loki, don't even. You're gonna get somebody in trouble.

2206
02:54:08,620 --> 02:54:10,260
I have a guess. What?

2207
02:54:10,260 --> 02:54:11,700
It's a song. Yeah, it is.

2208
02:54:11,700 --> 02:54:14,740
Uh, Flo Walk. Let's get a Flo Walk mic.

2209
02:54:14,740 --> 02:54:16,060
Okay, lay it on me.

2210
02:54:16,060 --> 02:54:17,760
Jazz is guessing

2211
02:54:17,760 --> 02:54:19,740
nucleus with something smooth.

2212
02:54:19,740 --> 02:54:23,180
There's a cell in the body that does not have a nucleus and the jelly and cream

2213
02:54:23,180 --> 02:54:24,900
cheese on the bagel are both smooth.

2214
02:54:24,900 --> 02:54:27,780
I'll give you something smooth.

2215
02:54:27,780 --> 02:54:28,420
Wow.

2216
02:54:28,420 --> 02:54:33,240
You know, when I said people were onto something, I was not kidding.

2217
02:54:33,240 --> 02:54:40,120
is on to it however he is only half right oh well you got 10 minutes to

2218
02:54:40,120 --> 02:54:43,680
figure it out or else you're gonna go another week without knowing sorry guys

2219
02:54:43,680 --> 02:54:48,360
Rob I think we should just keep playing Gemma Marmalade. Nah just just just don't even go

2220
02:54:48,360 --> 02:54:51,680
there don't even go there cuz you're gonna get somebody in trouble shut up

2221
02:54:51,680 --> 02:55:00,800
all right Loki you're not allowed to talk the rest of the show. Give to Radiskull.

2222
02:55:00,800 --> 02:55:03,800
Let's do some Ask Orange Lounge, boys and girls.

2223
02:55:09,800 --> 02:55:16,800
Let's Ask Orange Lounge, some stupid question. What will we find out tonight on Ask Orange Lounge?

2224
02:55:16,800 --> 02:55:24,800
We're gonna make a jam, and then we're gonna get it on, and hopefully someone will get that clue right about...

2225
02:55:24,800 --> 02:55:25,800
Did you say jam?

2226
02:55:26,800 --> 02:55:27,800
Moving on.

2227
02:55:27,800 --> 02:55:30,800
The show's on something after all.

2228
02:55:30,800 --> 02:55:34,800
Umm, Skypline's open as well, but please don't call if you've already been on this show.

2229
02:55:34,800 --> 02:55:36,800
We want other people to have a chance.

2230
02:55:36,800 --> 02:55:42,800
Well, I mean, I'm just saying that, you know, don't, you know, let's spread the love.

2231
02:55:42,800 --> 02:55:44,800
I wonder how jam shots would be.

2232
02:55:44,800 --> 02:55:47,800
Shut up! Shut up, seriously.

2233
02:55:47,800 --> 02:55:51,800
People are never going to come back to this program.

2234
02:55:51,800 --> 02:55:53,800
Alright.

2235
02:55:53,800 --> 02:56:04,680
Alright, I was going to take some questions from our chat room, but I don't see any questions

2236
02:56:04,680 --> 02:56:05,680
from our chat room.

2237
02:56:05,680 --> 02:56:07,680
Ask your question now!

2238
02:56:07,680 --> 02:56:13,600
Shut up, I swear to God I'm going to clock you with this microphone.

2239
02:56:13,600 --> 02:56:18,040
Hey, don't clock him.

2240
02:56:18,040 --> 02:56:23,640
Alright, Zaku has a question.

2241
02:56:23,640 --> 02:56:30,960
did you spend your summer vacation at work answering 40-plus calls in queue

2242
02:56:30,960 --> 02:56:35,280
from people trying to get student loans to go to school that's how I spent my

2243
02:56:35,280 --> 02:56:46,040
summer vacation next at work supposedly answering calls but it's

2244
02:56:46,040 --> 02:57:03,840
I was supposed to be answering calls, but I was brought on the internet instead.

2245
02:57:03,840 --> 02:57:06,720
Like many of you, I spent my summer not getting laid.

2246
02:57:06,720 --> 02:57:08,360
Luckily, summer's over.

2247
02:57:08,360 --> 02:57:11,640
I'm not included in that.

2248
02:57:11,640 --> 02:57:12,840
I was talking to our chat room.

2249
02:57:12,840 --> 02:57:15,840
Flowhawk, how'd you spend your summer vacation?

2250
02:57:15,840 --> 02:57:25,840
In a room right underneath an air conditioning vent, making step data for Ultimix 2, and I got to do a lot of different things.

2251
02:57:25,840 --> 02:57:37,840
I got to do some writing for Konami games, not just some project I've been on, but I got to be creative, and I got to use the words bitch and whore quite a bit.

2252
02:57:37,840 --> 02:57:41,840
So I think I was entertained.

2253
02:57:41,840 --> 02:57:47,900
someone figured it out finally we have a winner

2254
02:57:47,900 --> 02:57:51,020
thank God we get to play the damn song before the night's over

2255
02:57:51,020 --> 02:57:54,800
you don't say so what's the guess Rob?

2256
02:57:54,800 --> 02:57:58,700
well who got it first of all well the winner is white Rob is the person got it not me

2257
02:57:58,700 --> 02:57:59,940
I'm a white Rob as well

2258
02:57:59,940 --> 02:58:04,940
ho ho ho that's very obvious given your outfit Rob

2259
02:58:04,940 --> 02:58:09,300
and I'm giving him permission to tell our chat room what it is so the next

2260
02:58:09,300 --> 02:58:15,700
thing white rob says to you guys will be the name of the new song god it's about time so

2261
02:58:15,700 --> 02:58:21,380
white rob it's on you buddy a white guy getting he does not have skype he's on 56k so we can't

2262
02:58:21,380 --> 02:58:26,860
skype him but uh white rob figured it out so he just gets to post it in our chat room

2263
02:58:26,860 --> 02:58:30,660
and once he posts it by the way i really like this song watch him get booted i'm gonna queue

2264
02:58:30,660 --> 02:58:37,140
it up so you guys can hear some of it oh but he misspelled it he misspelled it but he still

2265
02:58:37,140 --> 02:58:48,100
got it right close enough. Nucleus. All right, so what is it guys? Let's tell the

2266
02:58:48,100 --> 02:58:50,220
people who are not in a chat room. What is the song?

2267
02:58:50,220 --> 02:58:56,740
Anybody want to say? It's Flo Walk, you should say. The song is by a group called Nucleus

2268
02:58:56,740 --> 02:59:01,540
back from the mid 80s and the joint is called Jam On It. And this is a very

2269
02:59:01,540 --> 02:59:05,260
unique song for DDR. All I can say is this song is a little bit special for

2270
02:59:05,260 --> 02:59:11,260
The only mix of the song I have is eight minutes in length, so I'm gonna only play you guys a clip, because eight minutes is a long time.

2271
02:59:11,260 --> 02:59:13,260
Oh, I'm sure the first, like, minute and a half, two minutes should be good enough.

2272
02:59:13,260 --> 02:59:17,260
So I'm just going to kind of start in the middle here and see what we get. Here we go.

2273
02:59:43,260 --> 02:59:46,260
Rockin' body right back, rockin' speed on the moon, right off the track

2274
02:59:46,260 --> 02:59:48,260
It's the whole wide world of funky time

2275
02:59:48,260 --> 02:59:50,260
Up to the beat, y'all, get down

2276
02:59:50,260 --> 02:59:52,260
Let me rock you to the rhythm of the funky sound

2277
02:59:52,260 --> 02:59:54,260
From hill to hill, above sea to sea

2278
02:59:54,260 --> 02:59:56,260
I went jam ons, rockin' everybody's screams

2279
02:59:56,260 --> 03:00:00,260
Jam on it, jam on it, jam on and on and on and on

2280
03:00:00,260 --> 03:00:03,260
It won't feel a lot, you wanna dance on that thing

2281
03:00:03,260 --> 03:00:05,260
Go on ahead and blow it

2282
03:00:05,260 --> 03:00:07,260
Cause jammin' on is what we do best

2283
03:00:07,260 --> 03:00:09,260
It's what separates us from the rest

2284
03:00:09,260 --> 03:00:11,260
And if you don't think about it, cruise down for real

2285
03:00:11,260 --> 03:00:35,980
Alright, that should give you a good idea of what that song sounds like.

2286
03:00:35,980 --> 03:00:40,540
Many of you guys remember that blast from the past song there.

2287
03:00:40,540 --> 03:00:45,240
Hopefully, Dancer X isn't too upset that, you know, somebody got it figured out, but,

2288
03:00:45,240 --> 03:00:49,320
you know what, that is the longest clue that ever went without being figured out, and so

2289
03:00:49,320 --> 03:00:55,880
for that, we give Dancer a big F-you, buddy, for making our lives hell. F-you, buddy!

2290
03:00:55,880 --> 03:01:01,480
I can't believe they didn't get it after we played Jammin' Marmalade on the Jazz and It's

2291
03:01:01,480 --> 03:01:03,520
Raining Men. I thought that would be like...

2292
03:01:03,520 --> 03:01:07,080
I thought that was completely obvious, too, but I guess people just, people don't think

2293
03:01:07,080 --> 03:01:08,340
we can have any fun with it.

2294
03:01:08,340 --> 03:01:17,340
Like I said, you guys did not have to think very abstract. There was a bagel, there was jam on it, and the bagel kind of looked like a nucleus or something.

2295
03:01:17,340 --> 03:01:20,340
Well, don't blame me. That's probably Dancer X's lame idea.

2296
03:01:20,340 --> 03:01:25,340
Don't explain the method to your guys' madness, you know, or to his madness.

2297
03:01:25,340 --> 03:01:29,340
Our madness is, we give you clues, you suffer.

2298
03:01:29,340 --> 03:01:32,340
Rinz, repeat.

2299
03:01:32,340 --> 03:01:40,880
Alright, hope you guys enjoyed and congratulations to White Rob for figuring that out.

2300
03:01:40,880 --> 03:01:45,440
You all owe him sex, or her, I imagine he's a him though because his name is Rob.

2301
03:01:45,440 --> 03:01:48,940
You all owe him sex for getting that right before the end of the show, just under the

2302
03:01:48,940 --> 03:01:49,940
wire.

2303
03:01:49,940 --> 03:01:53,840
I'll send him some chocolate instead, same difference.

2304
03:01:53,840 --> 03:02:00,200
Alright, I'll buy him one of those blow up pillows from Jlist.com.

2305
03:02:00,200 --> 03:02:03,940
I have to say I'm excited to play that song. As booty as it is, I think it brings back

2306
03:02:03,940 --> 03:02:06,520
solo, everything that was great about solo.

2307
03:02:06,520 --> 03:02:10,560
Well I think this is just showing up, like for UltraMix 2, how eclectic the music really

2308
03:02:10,560 --> 03:02:16,200
is. I mean, you heard everything from like, you know, just sort of like, you heard trance,

2309
03:02:16,200 --> 03:02:20,360
you've heard house, I mean obviously now you're hearing like old school rap, so we're trying

2310
03:02:20,360 --> 03:02:24,240
to touch as many, yeah, you know, break it, we're just trying to hit as many basses as

2311
03:02:24,240 --> 03:02:26,480
we can.

2312
03:02:26,480 --> 03:02:29,000
More to come.

2313
03:02:29,000 --> 03:02:35,720
fun ideas for clues in the future? I don't know we're still working on what

2314
03:02:35,720 --> 03:02:40,160
to do next. All right okay you know what guys it's time to wrap up the show I

2315
03:02:40,160 --> 03:02:44,000
hate to say it but the show's about over here so let's go around and get

2316
03:02:44,000 --> 03:02:47,640
everybody's final thought and for those you guys that didn't get your Ask Orange

2317
03:02:47,640 --> 03:02:51,800
Lounge questions in stay tuned to After Birth we'll get those answered. Let's see

2318
03:02:51,800 --> 03:02:53,800
Let's start with Lankystyle, your final thought.

2319
03:02:55,800 --> 03:02:57,800
Hi.

2320
03:02:57,800 --> 03:02:58,800
Alright, let's go to...

2321
03:02:58,800 --> 03:02:59,800
Oh no, what?

2322
03:02:59,800 --> 03:03:01,800
Oh, I've been drinking a little bit and I feel pretty good.

2323
03:03:01,800 --> 03:03:03,800
Alright, sounds good.

2324
03:03:03,800 --> 03:03:07,800
Let's go to, I guess, FlowWalk, you get a mic. What's your final thought?

2325
03:03:07,800 --> 03:03:12,800
Message over to you, same in the chat room. I got three letters for you. L-O-L.

2326
03:03:12,800 --> 03:03:15,800
And Sharkskroll, your final thought.

2327
03:03:15,800 --> 03:03:18,800
I'm feeling very Jerry Springer here.

2328
03:03:18,800 --> 03:03:22,800
Angel, your final thought?

2329
03:03:22,800 --> 03:03:24,800
I got a present from Loki.

2330
03:03:24,800 --> 03:03:25,800
Yay.

2331
03:03:25,800 --> 03:03:26,800
Yay.

2332
03:03:26,800 --> 03:03:27,800
Yay.

2333
03:03:27,800 --> 03:03:28,800
Oh, the CD?

2334
03:03:28,800 --> 03:03:29,800
Yes, the CD.

2335
03:03:29,800 --> 03:03:30,800
Good job.

2336
03:03:30,800 --> 03:03:31,800
Explicit, your final thought?

2337
03:03:31,800 --> 03:03:36,300
Can you come back to me on that one?

2338
03:03:36,300 --> 03:03:37,300
Can I what?

2339
03:03:37,300 --> 03:03:38,300
Come back.

2340
03:03:38,300 --> 03:03:39,300
No.

2341
03:03:39,300 --> 03:03:40,300
Damn you!

2342
03:03:40,300 --> 03:03:43,260
Alright, Loki, your final thought?

2343
03:03:43,260 --> 03:03:47,100
If I shake my head, I get dizzy.

2344
03:03:47,100 --> 03:03:48,260
He's getting drunk, guys.

2345
03:03:48,260 --> 03:03:53,260
Gypsy Wolf, your final thought.

2346
03:03:53,260 --> 03:04:00,580
Um, whoever's throwing beer bottles at people for waving, keep doing it. It's kind of entertaining.

2347
03:04:00,580 --> 03:04:03,020
My final thought is, um,

2348
03:04:03,020 --> 03:04:09,340
listen to our station a lot and whore up our hours and win in a Curio Mocha CD.

2349
03:04:09,340 --> 03:04:13,220
Uh, DarkSakura, your final thought.

2350
03:04:13,220 --> 03:04:15,900
My final thought is

2351
03:04:15,900 --> 03:04:17,900
I want to go on leave

2352
03:04:17,900 --> 03:04:26,080
like travel but I want to be paid for it so pay me to travel send me to what the

2353
03:04:26,080 --> 03:04:37,900
fuck are you doing with my final thought is I want air conditioning and money

2354
03:04:37,900 --> 03:04:43,960
insects all right we're gonna give Wow Wow no order in that order in that order

2355
03:04:43,960 --> 03:04:45,640
because air conditioning is more important.

2356
03:04:45,640 --> 03:04:46,880
All right.

2357
03:04:46,880 --> 03:04:48,400
The final word of tonight's show,

2358
03:04:48,400 --> 03:04:49,240
I'm gonna give it to somebody

2359
03:04:49,240 --> 03:04:50,420
who didn't say a whole lot tonight.

2360
03:04:50,420 --> 03:04:52,640
Sharks Girl, you gotta give us one word

2361
03:04:52,640 --> 03:04:54,200
that sums everything up.

2362
03:04:54,200 --> 03:04:56,260
The final word of the show.

2363
03:04:56,260 --> 03:04:58,600
Okay, my friend Donna will understand this.

2364
03:04:58,600 --> 03:04:59,440
Beans!

2365
03:05:00,720 --> 03:05:03,160

You other brothers can't deny

That when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist

Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

2393
03:08:35,420 --> 03:08:42,420
Alright, here's the afterbirth, the part of the show after the credits have faded to black.

2394
03:08:42,420 --> 03:08:49,420
I got to make this quick tonight because I'm going out tonight, but I wanted to get the rest of these Ask Orange Lounge questions in because there were some good ones in here.

2395
03:08:49,420 --> 03:08:54,420
I didn't think anyone was going to get the jam on it thing. I seriously didn't. Two minutes left in the show.

2396
03:08:54,420 --> 03:08:59,420
It was my drunkenness and saying I should do jam shots that clued them in.

2397
03:08:59,420 --> 03:09:02,820
Seagurd was gonna ask

2398
03:09:02,820 --> 03:09:06,740
Dear Ask Orange Lounge, why can't the chat room figure out this easy clue?

2399
03:09:06,740 --> 03:09:07,860
Well, you got owned, didn't you?

2400
03:09:07,860 --> 03:09:11,740
You got furred!

2401
03:09:11,740 --> 03:09:16,660
Dark Knight says, I got one out of all the drunk shows. What's the record for

2402
03:09:16,660 --> 03:09:17,180
most

2403
03:09:17,180 --> 03:09:21,820
drinks in an episode? I have a guess. Maybe Dark Sakura wants to share.

2404
03:09:21,820 --> 03:09:25,060
Okay, what are you talking about? The time I had like, what,

2405
03:09:25,060 --> 03:09:29,380
10 beverages within an hour? Uh, you think?

2406
03:09:29,380 --> 03:09:33,240
The last trunk show that we did I had four double shots of tequila

2407
03:09:35,140 --> 03:09:39,120
That cheap-ass stuff too and I had half a bottle of

2408
03:09:40,440 --> 03:09:43,500
The mudslide mix the TGR Friday's mudslide. I

2409
03:09:44,020 --> 03:09:49,680
Finished off the rest about that much of a bottle about maybe three inches worth of the bottle of the Long Island iced tea

2410
03:09:50,920 --> 03:09:54,300
What else did I have? Oh, yeah, and I kept making these screwdrivers out of

2411
03:09:55,600 --> 03:09:57,560
Malibu and

2412
03:09:57,560 --> 03:09:59,560
And I kept drinking those too.

2413
03:09:59,560 --> 03:10:04,560
So, I was very drunk, and the thing is, is that where I have really good tolerance,

2414
03:10:04,560 --> 03:10:12,560
that much alcohol in the span of an hour, I ended up passing out on Rob's bed and eating like half of Matt's box of waffles.

2415
03:10:12,560 --> 03:10:14,560
Yeah, I remember that.

2416
03:10:14,560 --> 03:10:16,560
Which I probably still owe you the waffles.

2417
03:10:16,560 --> 03:10:18,560
Yeah.

2418
03:10:18,560 --> 03:10:19,560
I'll get you some waffles.

2419
03:10:19,560 --> 03:10:31,560
Um, tonight I had, what was it, five screwdrivers. Both are, all of them with, um, two shots of vodka in them. So, I guess that'd be ten shots of vodka over the course of three hours.

2420
03:10:31,560 --> 03:10:34,560
Right now, really, I don't feel that drunk. I mean, I'm a little dizzy.

2421
03:10:34,560 --> 03:10:38,560
Over the course of three hours is a lot better than over the course of an hour.

2422
03:10:38,560 --> 03:10:48,560
Well, I didn't want to kill myself, but, you know, um, no, right now I just feel very full because that's, like, a whole thing of orange juice right there. I mean, that's a lot of orange juice.

2423
03:10:48,560 --> 03:10:58,560
What I'm worried about though, Loki, sorry, what I'm worried about though, Loki, is you haven't like, I haven't seen you go to the bathroom in these three hour span.

2424
03:10:58,560 --> 03:11:01,560
You're a time bomb waiting to go off, man.

2425
03:11:01,560 --> 03:11:02,560
Why?

2426
03:11:02,560 --> 03:11:07,560
You drink that much alcohol and orange juice, something's gonna explode, man.

2427
03:11:07,560 --> 03:11:08,560
My stomach, yeah.

2428
03:11:08,560 --> 03:11:10,560
Yeah, all over the...

2429
03:11:10,560 --> 03:11:12,560
No, I've never thrown up from alcohol.

2430
03:11:12,560 --> 03:11:16,560
No, not throwing up, I'm talking about something else. You haven't been to the bathroom.

2431
03:11:16,560 --> 03:11:25,760
I'm not into water sports, so take care of that.

2432
03:11:25,760 --> 03:11:26,760
All right.

2433
03:11:26,760 --> 03:11:27,760
I'll wake up in the middle of the night.

2434
03:11:27,760 --> 03:11:28,980
Why am I all wet?

2435
03:11:28,980 --> 03:11:31,600
I've got to hurry up through the rest of these questions, you guys.

2436
03:11:31,600 --> 03:11:38,400
Zaku, will you be playing drunk DDR and or any Bamani tonight?

2437
03:11:38,400 --> 03:11:39,400
Probably not.

2438
03:11:39,400 --> 03:11:41,600
I think most people are going home, and I'm going to the club.

2439
03:11:41,600 --> 03:11:46,320
Karma Titan says, question number 108, booga, booga, booga, yay or nay?

2440
03:11:46,320 --> 03:11:49,320
Oh my gosh, you guys should have a copy of that.

2441
03:11:49,320 --> 03:11:54,320
If you're referring to Booga Booga, no, I'm not playing any game where I stick a finger up someone's ass.

2442
03:11:54,320 --> 03:11:57,320
I think it was just Booga Booga Booga. I say yay to Booga Booga Booga.

2443
03:11:57,320 --> 03:12:00,320
Booga Booga Booga is cool. Booga Booga is not.

2444
03:12:00,320 --> 03:12:01,320
What is Booga Booga Booga?

2445
03:12:01,320 --> 03:12:02,320
I don't know.

2446
03:12:02,320 --> 03:12:08,320
Uh, Shay23, last question. Any idea when the 8th style limited edition can be bought?

2447
03:12:08,320 --> 03:12:11,320
They're taking pre-orders on Konami style already.

2448
03:12:11,320 --> 03:12:13,320
Taking pre-orders on Konami style already.

2449
03:12:13,320 --> 03:12:16,320
From Flo walk take
