00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:08,020
Dark stack right. I'm going to do something that I haven't done in a while.

You see this potato? Yes. Look I'm putting it on the webcam.

00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,920
Webcam. I can't see the webcam.

19
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,240
I'm just going to hold it out here indefinitely. Okay.

20
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:24,260
I am eating a potato. Do you want me to go walk over there and hold it in front of the camera?

21
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,260
Oh, she ate it.

22
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,260
Potatoes.

23
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,260
You don't eat potatoes anymore.

24
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:34,260
No. You were right. These are some pretty damn good country potatoes.

25
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:41,260
Dude, I nearly got run off the road like three times, but one of them I didn't mind because he was really hot.

26
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:52,260
No, seriously. This guy in this big, humongous truck, and he was just like, hot, and then I passed him.

27
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,860
And then he passed me, and he had Alabama plates.

28
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:00,660
Oh my. And on top of that, it was Houston County plates.

29
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,940
Oh. I was born in Houston County.

30
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:11,420
Dothan, Alabama. God, Dothan, Alabama is where our fucking movie gallery headquarters is.

00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,060
I'm going to start off the show by just saying this disclaimer.

117
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:27,220
Sorry guys, we don't have anybody special from KDAA here tonight.

118
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,220
Maybe next time.

119
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,220
I don't know.

120
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,220
Hey, I'm fucking special, okay?

121
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,900
But you should listen to us because we rock.

122
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,140
You sure are special.

00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:42,020
We're dorks and we make asses of ourselves on the radio for your benefit.

127
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,020
I'm a dork. I'm a dork.

128
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,020
Okay, you're a geek, sorry.

129
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,020
Thank you. Get it right.

130
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:52,020
This has been the week for geek stuff, I swear. All the good games come out.

131
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,020
How so?

132
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,020
What games?

133
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,020
Just Silent Hill 4. What else do you need?

134
00:14:56,020 --> 00:15:03,020
Yeah, well, you know, I went shopping and I picked up lots of good geek stuff that's gonna give me hours of entertainment.

135
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:09,020
I guess this should be a good segue into how was your week, how was your day, and we'll start it off by hearing from DarkSakura.

136
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,020
DarkSakura, how was your week? How was your day?

137
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:17,140
My week was pretty damn good. I did homework all week. I worked all week, but we finally

138
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:20,940
started getting slow because all of the little kiddies who needed their student loans are

139
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:32,640
now happily in class. Thank God. So it's just been, you know, we get a little bit of a pick

140
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:39,180
up at work, but other than that it's just nice and relaxed and we finally get a chance

141
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:45,880
get all of our crap done and of course lo and behold the moment we get a slow

142
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:50,660
week I get like five escalated calls that I deal with all by myself because I

143
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:56,980
don't really like to let anybody else handle my business and then I finally

144
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:04,060
picked up my student loan money the saga is over it's just a whole bunch of crap

145
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:10,540
because ARC is backwards as hell so uh oh that's beautiful Rob. Rob is putting the

146
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:17,600
ignition pad box on his head. He is digging for ignition. Oh my god. He feels the ignition. It's not

147
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:27,460
pyramid head it's moron head. Rob you been on the sugar or something? Some caffeine

148
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:35,260
some code red I should take a crap in that box okay excuse me I was trying to

149
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:43,140
talk about my week thank you sorry I was having a Silent Hill moment and ignition

150
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:52,300

151
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:57,420
Hill for this week I lament over this but I got something very nice and

152
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:04,680
compensation I finally finally finally dimple over here in Sacramento got more

153
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:09,540
of those Stargate box sets in you know nice and used but the discs are all in

154
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:16,380
good shape so I picked up one of them and their used product is usually pretty

155
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:22,080

00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:49,980

avoid landmines because you never know when you're going to be taking a stroll

166
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:30,360
through a minefield. Don't go to Korea! The other thing I've been doing this week is

basically downloading like a Mad Fiend getting ready to install my nice lovely

168
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:40,160
250 gigabyte hard drive. Ooh, pretty. They rock so much I have one too. They're awesome.

169
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,320
The only thing I don't like is that it's a Maxter and I prefer Western Digital

170
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:48,520
because you know my hard drive that died like soon after I got my bio was a... Maxter fucking O.G.

171
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,240
Was the Maxtor mine's a Western Digital and

172
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,280
But Dan's lasted for four years and his but his was a master

173
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:00,720
He started messing up when he started doing that image screen saver because he has it on his main cabinet and he started pulling up

174
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,720
Different main images. Hmm, and

175
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:08,640
It's just it recycled all those images and it keeps pulling from your hard drive. So I guess it just wore it out. It was spent

176
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,040
weird

177
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:17,920
250 gigabytes, by the way will hold a hell of a lot of porn just so you know, thank you Rob

178
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:23,420
Rob, I appreciate your informative attention to the content of my hard drive.

179
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,920
Anytime. That's what I do on this show.

180
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,920
I don't have porn.

181
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,420
I give public service announcements.

182
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:31,920
That's like 60 dual-layer DVDs of porn.

183
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,920
60 dual-layer?

184
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:37,920
I don't have porn either. Why would I save it when I can always re-access the website at a later date?

185
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,920
Liar!

186
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:44,420
I save it just in case if I need porn and the internet is down.

187
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:49,700
in such an emergency case like that I require porn to be on the hard drive at

188
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,340
all times

189
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:53,940
I see. You're engaged why do you need porn?

190
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:58,460
As you see I do not live with my fiancee

191
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:02,380
wait a minute I can answer this as his roommate and somebody that sees him

192
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,180
interact with his fiancee regularly

193
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:07,700
it's because she is a porn fiend too and they watch it together she is more into

194
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,780
the porn than he is

195
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:13,640
Dude porn's funny. She came over here the other day

196
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,160
and requested to watch the Paris Hilton tape. I'm like...

197
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,160
I've never seen that. How bad is it?

198
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:24,160
Again? I've seen it like three times. It's not that interesting.

199
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,760
Okay, back to my week. By the way, Janae,

200
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,400
I just want to let you know the lighting makes you look naked on our cam according to the...

201
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:35,400
which is amazing considering she's wearing a pink shirt

202
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:40,560
yet she's black. She looks like fucking red on the cam. How does she look naked?

203
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,560
It's just one giant nipple.

204
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,560
Yeah, that's because our chat room has issues.

205
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,560
It doesn't even look...

206
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:50,560
Okay, I'm turning from the chat room so that I can play with the chat room again.

207
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:54,560
Oh, sorry, I didn't know the camera was still on.

208
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,560
Anyway...

209
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,560
Sorry, how was your week, how was your day, Jamie?

210
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:05,560
I'm all pissed off because of the hurricane, because its path is going to go through Mobile.

211
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,560
And I'm really...

212
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,560
Is that that killer hurricane?

213
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:13,920
Yeah, but by the time it hits in Alabama it's gonna be like

214
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,960
maybe a type 2. I hope it doesn't hit where I'm going.

215
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,200
I don't think it will though. Okay, first of all, you're going to freaking Pennsylvania and I think the last time

216
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,280
a hurricane hit Pennsylvania was... never!

217
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:28,920
But you're saying there's a chance. No, I'm not saying that there's a chance.

218
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:33,840
What if a volcano erupts while I'm out there? Hey, you're not traveling to L.A.

219
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,240
Okay, first of all, there are no volcanoes in Pennsylvania.

220
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:43,120
Rob, there's no volcanoes in LA either. The worst you will ever see

221
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,860
is a freak blizzard and it's, what month is this? September!

222
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:50,300
I don't think it snows in September in Pennsylvania. What if there's a tornado?

223
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:53,400
I don't think they can get tornadoes there either.

224
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:58,800
Okay, Rob, the hardest thing that you have to worry about is drowning.

225
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:03,640
And I don't know if you're going out over water, so I don't think you need to worry about it.

226
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:11,640
What you've got to worry about is splash damage from any sort of attack on New York.

227
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,640
Shut up.

228
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,640
Because, I mean, New York is just a target for any, like, mutated monster, alien, space

229
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:25,720
being, terrorist, natural disaster. New York is just a fucking magnet for that shit. So

230
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,640
you've got to worry about, like, you know, stuff going on.

231
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,640
Got zero.

232
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,640
Okay. Sorry, Jamie. How was your week? How was your day?

233
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,640
Oh, it's still my turn, isn't it?

234
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,640
I guess. Well, how special.

235
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,640
So I wanted to go see the new

236
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,640
Resident Evil movie, because I love Resident Evil. You and every

237
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,640
teenage boy in the nation. And I love guns.

238
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,640
I like firearms a whole lot. I like violence and I

239
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,640
love seeing zombies explode. This movie's for you then, because there's

240
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:05,240
there's about nothing else in this movie besides that i'd love violence

241
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:08,920
i really really really big violent

242
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:12,240
and i think good acting too

243
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,640
that they need to see a different movie for that

244
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,200
at least they've got people who at least can act their way out of a brown bag and

245
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,120
not you know

246
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,880
and back into one

247
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:25,120
but out instead though i went ahead and uh...

248
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:29,120
i went to uh...

249
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:34,660
out with iguana girl yesterday and we watched the ring which I love that movie

250
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:38,500
so much so I'm gonna get on this big Ringo marathon I'm gonna watch ring I

251
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,820
actually watched the ring last night yeah we I need to watch you on look you

252
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,980
got a copy of Juwan which is going to be the grudge in a couple months here in

253
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:50,620
America I wanna look at you on is coming to DVD I didn't well which makes sense

254
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:55,100
whenever they remake movies the original always comes out to DVDs yeah but I have

255
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:59,100
I have the eye at home and I want to watch that too.

256
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:03,100
I have that too.

257
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:07,100
I'm just really looking forward though

258
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:11,100
to some good movies coming out. I need something random and violent.

259
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:15,100
But hanging out last night, I was all happy.

260
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:19,100
We went out and got chocolate and ate junk food.

261
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:23,100
Was it a slumber party? Did you get ice cream and talk about

262
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:27,100
We got ice cream and we did talk about voids.

263
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,100
It was a slumber party.

264
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:31,100
It was a slumber party because I went home.

265
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:36,100
We did not play mystery day or secret shopper or whatever the hell that was.

266
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:39,100
It was a slumber party because if I had...

267
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,100
Or burning mall of doom.

268
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,100
No twister.

269
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,100
No twister.

270
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,100
We just watched movies.

271
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:46,100
It was a slumber party because if I had went I would have fallen asleep.

272
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:49,100
You bitch.

273
00:24:49,100 --> 00:25:05,100
But earlier than that though I went to the gym and I am in so much pain today because my trainer decided that my arms need extra attention because I'm not losing size in my arms.

274
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:11,100
So I'm going to end up looking like Terminator lady in two months and that's going to be cool.

275
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:15,100
People will be afraid of me and I'll like it.

276
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:18,100
Is the camera's up there?

277
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,100
See the blue light? See the black light? Good!

278
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:24,100
Yes, we here at Orange House Radio use an iToy as our webcam.

279
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:27,100
Because we are that ghetto-rific.

280
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:30,100
Dude, the iToy is a much better webcam than the kind of crap I have at home.

281
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,100
I can't even find. My webcam turned up missing.

282
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:37,100
As Loki said, it's a better webcam than it is a game.

283
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:43,100
But, um, the rest of it's been me on the hunt for something that isn't crap to listen to.

284
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:49,100
Okay, you can stop fondling the fake boobs on the webcam, because that's just stupid.

285
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:52,100
You have real boobs to fondle!

286
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,100
Pay attention to your woman!

287
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:57,100
Okay, I'm done, because people keep interrupting me.

288
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:00,100
I forgot what I was talking about anyway.

289
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,100
Oh yeah, I'm leaving in November.

290
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,100
Permanently?

291
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,100
No.

292
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,100
Where are you going?

293
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,100
I didn't want to be that easy.

294
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,100
You had me scared for a minute, the way you said.

295
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,100
Going home to see my family.

296
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,100
Oh, well that's good.

297
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:22,100
I'm going to eat lots of food because it's Thanksgiving, and I'm going to be such a lazy bitch the whole weekend.

298
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:29,100
I'm going to go see my daddy, and I'm going to go up to Ozark.

299
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:32,100
You know you're in Alabama when there's a town called Ozark.

300
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,100
Are you going to play any DDR at all?

301
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,100
Yes, I will.

302
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:41,260
Yeah, I will go to the cyber station and I will play DDR and leave lots of Orange Lounge radio

303
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:45,220
Right on laying around on I'm gonna try and do that on my trip

304
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:49,700
I will horse out and if anybody's in the area wants to meet up and hang out

305
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:55,360
Thanksgiving is off, but the day after school. All right, cool. I'm done. All right

306
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,100
moving on pixie dust

307
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:02,140
The Orange Lounge Radio, madam. How was your week? How was your day, honey?

308
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:05,380
Well, it's hot in here.

309
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:11,060
So take off all your clothes. No, because everybody on the webcam thinks I'm naked anyway, so what's the point?

310
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:15,780
Well, my week kinda sucked. I got put on light duty

311
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:19,060
for a case of tendonitis in my right arm.

312
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:23,180
So I had to spend Labor Day at the hospital, and then

313
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:26,540
was off for three days of work, and then

314
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:30,700
got to the physical therapy which all they did was put me on ibuprofen and

315
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:35,420
Vicodin. So basically I've been sleeping. I love Vicodin. You know, I can only take

316
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:39,760
half of Vicodin. Really? I lived on Vicodin when I had my

317
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:44,580
wisdom teeth out. Oh yeah, that's right. For a month and my resistance to Vicodin was so high

318
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:50,540
by the end of the time. A real quick personal reminder, DO NOT PM BIMANI

319
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:55,300
KADE! We will not respond to you! Thank you. I'm not on this Bimani Kade, I'm on

320
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:58,220
the Dark Sakura, but don't send me any private messages!

321
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,220
Wow.

322
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:03,220
Loki, you need a lesson in holding the microphone at a good distance away from your mouth.

323
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,220
Oh yeah?

324
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,220
Don't kiss me.

325
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,220
Other than that, the week was pretty good.

326
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:13,060
Went to work, spent time with Victor when he came up, and...yeah, yesterday, what did

327
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,060
we do yesterday?

328
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,060
His parents were microphones.

329
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,060
What?

330
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,060
It's probably mine.

331
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,060
Ah, it's true.

332
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,060
Yeah, it's mine.

333
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,060
I don't know.

334
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,060
Anyways, what did we do yesterday?

335
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,060
We went somewhere.

336
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,060
Uh...

337
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:28,060
Well, we had ramen today. We had miso ramen today. I've never had it before.

338
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:30,060
So we did that.

339
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:33,060
I don't know what we did yesterday.

340
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:35,060
Dammit.

341
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:37,060
Oh yeah, Angel's on her way too.

342
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:39,060
Joy and Rapture.

343
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:43,060
Joy and Rapture. Angel, Darkchild, and Anita are...

344
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:47,060
Yes, I know Anita's coming and she's bringing something with her.

345
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,060
I know what it is.

346
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,060
I know too.

347
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,060
We'll see in a little bit. Anyway...

348
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:53,660
She's bleeding sores, that's what she's bringing.

349
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:56,220
She's bringing her herpes to share with everybody.

350
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,940
Everybody's bringing their herpes today, except for Jamie.

351
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:58,940
So excited.

352
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,740
So, it's been pretty...

353
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:03,260
What about herpes?

354
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:05,380
Everybody's bringing their herpes, except for Jamie.

355
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:08,660
Yeah, I went to the doctor.

356
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:15,660
Other than that, we've been pretty boring.

357
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,880
Alright.

358
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,880
No styling.

359
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,880
How was your week?

360
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,880
How was your day?

361
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:25,880
Hello, chat room. My week's been boring. Actually, no, exciting with my woman, you know, Janae or...

362
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,880
Speak up.

363
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,880
Hello.

364
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:34,880
I cannot believe how freaking quiet you are in person when online you are the most annoying fucker I've ever seen.

365
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,880
I have not been alive since my woman, you know.

366
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,880
I know.

367
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,880
Isn't that amazing?

368
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:43,880
The ER community has pixie dust to thank for getting No Style in Laid.

369
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,880
Oh!

370
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,880
I'll be back, don't worry.

371
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:51,880
Guess what? I learned a trick from Jason just recently, yesterday. That's where we went, we went to Jason's house last night.

372
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,880
You wanna show me, wanna me show you my trick?

373
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,380
Yeah, what's your trick?

374
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:54,880
It's from cops.

375
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,880
I'm gonna show you it.

376
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,880
A trick from cops? Okay.

377
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,880
Uh, pixie dust is getting up.

378
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,880
And, oh, she's lifting her shirt.

379
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,880
She's showing off her belly button going, what's up?

380
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,880
You know that's on the cam right now.

381
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,880
My woman only gets naked for me.

382
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:18,880
I have to give props to the chat room, though, for making a reference to Ice Pirates, cause that movie's awesome.

383
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,880
Space Herpes.

384
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,880
Anyway, anything else you want to share about your weekend?

385
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:33,880
Yeah, I go back, uh, I work tomorrow morning around 7 AM, and that's it. Back to the Bay Area.

386
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:37,880
Back to my boring old life. In the Bay Area.

387
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,880
Oh, wow.

388
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,880
Oh, we got a kid, too. We got our first kid.

389
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,920
What's that? We've got an aqua pet.

390
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:48,760
She's saying that she dances and she's lovely.

391
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:52,920
It's not a she. It's a she! No it isn't. It's a she.

392
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:57,880
It's a she. It's a tree. It's a she. We're trying to fix our webcam by the way. We see it's really dark so

393
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,840
we're working on it right now at orangelandrado.com is where the cam's at.

394
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:04,920
The shape of a penis. The aqua pet, the actual thing is like the shape of a penis and

395
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:10,440
twig and berries basically. And the little pet on the inside is attached by strings and

396
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:14,640
whatnot and it does a little song and dance and it's so cute. It's the happy

397
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:22,920
penis of love. It's the happy penis tree sprite. Happy penis tree sprite. And Angel will be

398
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:27,660
bringing her happy penis with her today. Moving on. Okay, I didn't need to hear that.

399
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:32,280
I'll talk about... I'm gonna go hide in the chair. Since Loki's busy over there, I'll talk about my week

400
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:39,200
and my day. My week was okay. It wasn't hugely exciting. I decided to go see a

401
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,120
movie as well but there was no way in hell I was gonna see that Resident Evil

402
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:47,960
garbage so I decided to uh as much as I like guns and violence I decided to go

403
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:51,640
see something artsy and I went and saw Garden State and it was very it was very

404
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:55,640
good and Natalie Portman very good in that movie I know a lot of boys out

405
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:59,480
there think she's really hot and they'll love this movie because she doesn't get

406
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:03,840
naked though I hate although she is in the pool in her undies so maybe the boys

407
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:10,040
like that. She's very smart. She's very smart. She's very good in that movie. What school

408
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:15,520
is she going to? I don't know, but she's a good actress, that's all that matters. So

409
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:22,460
we did that and today I finally caved and I don't know how many people know the story

410
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:27,880
but I inherited an ignition pad from my last relationship because when, you know, they

411
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:33,720
moved away, they left a bunch of stuff here and I got to keep it, including third style

412
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:37,280
force style and a new ignition pad and it lived at my house for a while and it

413
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:41,160
lived at Jamie's house but when I got it back it didn't work anymore so I don't

414
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:45,880
get it it worked at my house I bring it over here and it didn't want to put out

415
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:50,800
for you no big deal it had it had bad it had a most men it had a bad aura about

416
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:55,680
it anyway it had a bad vibe so I burned it in the front yard and no I'm kidding

417
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:59,260
it's actually still my room but I went out and I bought a brand new ignition

418
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:02,920
pad today and it was so funny because when I went into GameStop and actually

419
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:06,880
I haven't really been buying things at GameStop. No, sorry Jamie because I know your man works there

420
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:11,720
But the people at GameCrazy are actually really nice to me. You look game crazy. You're awesome

421
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:18,520
So I've been shopping at GameCrazy lately. That's where I got my nickname. What nickname is that? My nickname was was Jamie the

422
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:22,680
The what was it the totally awesome and never nice

423
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,280
I'm now totally awesome and ever nice awesome

424
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:41,280
So, I got the Ignition Pad over at Gamestop because I know they sell Red Octane products there, and as much as I hate whoring out Red Octane because their name is everywhere in the Bamani community, it's like if you have a pulse and you play DDR, you can get sponsored by Red Octane.

425
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,280
Red Octane.

426
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,280
But they really do, this show is not sponsored by them, by the way.

427
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,280
Because we don't whore ourselves out for anybody.

428
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,280
Yeah, exactly.

429
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,280
Except Konami.

430
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,280
Yeah.

431
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,280
Except for me.

432
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:53,760
have to admit the ignition pad 2.0 is very nice and it's the only thing I

433
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:57,320
would play DDR at home on because I have yet to see anything better except the

434
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,880
metal pads but I'm I'm kind of poor like ignition pads are expensive enough I

435
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,240
paid $99.99 for that and then when I checked it out at GameStop the guy was

436
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:11,360
like whoa he was like Keanu Reeves kind of he was like whoa I've never seen

437
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:15,520
anybody buy one of these before like the why do you have them out on the floor

438
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:45,520
Where did you, which one did you go to? The Madison Mall. Oh. He's like, I've never seen anyone buy one of these before. If you want to go to where all the cool people are, go to the one that my man manages. Yeah, but I didn't want to drive all the way out there. Ah, it's worth it. And then he, then he said, well, if you're a DDR fan, you want to reserve a copy of Extreme? I'm like, actually, we've already got that taken care of. And then he's like, I'm like, you know, I hear Ultramix 2 is going to be really good. Like, I'm trying to start telling you, he's like, if you want to reserve any game, man, we

439
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,200
got it for you if you want to reserve anything and then he's like I still

440
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:54,840
can't believe you're actually buying one like the other one broke smoking weed in

441
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:59,440
the back room killed that's the difference between working for minimum

442
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:04,960
wage well I don't know California minimum wage is higher than it is

443
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:11,920
anywhere else but but and any no I've done it you know I've worked but I still

444
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:19,160
bought expensive stuff. I remember saving up for like a month to buy an imported Sailor

445
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:22,960
Moon game back when I was into Sailor Moon ten years ago.

446
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,680
Well the nice thing is that when I travel, which I'm going to be doing for work here

447
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:30,920
for the next two weeks, I stand to profit a little bit of money because they pay for

448
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:34,040
all my food and gas and stuff. So that's how I can afford to splurge a little bit and buy

449
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:37,200
an ignition pad. And all the video games I've been buying this week, such as Silent Hill

450
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,680
4, which I've been playing quite a bit of.

451
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,960
It's going to live at my house.

452
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,080
Yes, and now Jamie's borrowing it for two weeks, so I want that back when I come back.

453
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,080
You'll get it back.

454
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:50,800
Because I'm like, I think I estimate something happened that kind of indicates to me, I don't

455
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,840
want to spoil, but something happened that indicates to me I'm about halfway through.

456
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:57,800
So I want to finish it definitely when I get back, because it's been holding my attention

457
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:02,940
really well, and it's a good game, graphics are awesome, story line's really good, music's

458
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:03,940
great too.

459
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:06,420
Although I haven't heard a lot of the songs on the soundtrack, I've only picked out like

460
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:10,740
three songs so far but when they use the way they use room of angels in the game

461
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:14,820
awesome awesome awesome anyway so Silent Hill 4 definitely get it if you like

462
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:19,020
Silent Hill games or scary games I actually yesterday I was sitting here

463
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:21,820
and I was playing and I was in this one level and I got scared I actually went

464
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:26,900
like that and map or Loki looked at me and was just like the hell is wrong with

465
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:33,900
you a secret says you're halfway through he was just like he's all oh shit I was

466
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:39,900
like

467
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:44,420
anyway so I that scared the crap outta me those little two-headed baby things

468
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:48,020
scared the shit outta me. I wanted to see the wheelchairs

469
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:51,140
but there's a monster, yes I got to the wheelchair scene and it's awesome

470
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:54,620
not nearly as cool as the monsters that burp when you hit them

471
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:57,740
monsters that burp? There's burping monsters they're awesome

472
00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:01,060
I really need, I need, see I haven't played anything really gross

473
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:04,260
I want to, what's a scene that has a humongous head?

474
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,900
Oh, oh, it's the best thing ever!

475
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:11,180
I, I, it's scared, I'm serious, it's scared the crap, me and my significant other was

476
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:15,540
watching me play it last night, and we both, like, were just like, what the fuck was that?

477
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:16,540
Like when we saw it.

478
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,540
Because I saw a picture of it.

479
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:18,540
It's awesome.

480
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,620
And I was, like, going to make an icon of it from my live journal.

481
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:21,620
It's awesome.

482
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,060
That said, oh my god, what the hell is this?

483
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:27,580
But not, not nearly as good as the burping monsters, because every time I would hit one,

484
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:29,440
my SO would start cracking up.

485
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:33,440
Do you know that one icon that I made of the woman looking all beat up?

486
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,440
Have you gotten to that scene yet? Because I want to know what scene that's from.

487
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,440
Yes. It's kind of a spoiler.

488
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,440
Okay, well nevermind.

489
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,440
I can't tell if it's... I can't remember if it was...

490
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,440
I think it was Eileen in your icon. I can't remember if it was Cynthia or Eileen.

491
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,440
She was wearing the red dress.

492
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,440
I'm pretty sure it was Eileen though.

493
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,440
But see, that was Cynthia, but...

494
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,440
And she was all beaten up.

495
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:54,440
It makes sense for Eileen, but Eileen kind of has a red dress on at one point, so...

496
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:57,440
Okay, I see. I really need to sit down and play this.

497
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,440
Seegerd would know. Show Seegerd the icon, he would know.

498
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:03,440
He knows which one, because he was the one who gave me the advice on my text on it.

499
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,440
Anyway, burping monsters rock everything.

500
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,440
Burping monsters are cool.

501
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,440
What?

502
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,440
Are they the ones, what about the ones who come out of the ceiling?

503
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:19,440
All of the zombies kind of come out of the walls. They're scary. They look like...

504
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,440
Do they actually go into the room?

505
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,440
I don't want to spoil anything.

506
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,440
Okay.

507
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,780
Anyway, moving on. Just play it. You'll be glad you played it. Just play it.

508
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:34,400
What else? So, Ignition Pad. Hello, back to the Ignition Pad. I've actually been playing

509
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,580
non-stop for like two and a half hours today. I've been playing DDR UltraMix online.

510
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:40,880
And I actually didn't think anyone played this game anymore, but I've been playing in matches

511
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,140
non-stop all day.

512
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:46,580
And I've just been having a blast, honestly. I've been meeting some funny people on there.

513
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:49,780
The only thing that pissed me off is that the extension cable for my communicator that

514
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,020
came with the Ignition Pad

515
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:54,940
doesn't work. So I'm not able to talk to people while I play. I can only talk before

516
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:59,940
before and after matches, but I've been having tons of fun, and I am all revved up for Ultra Mix 2, honestly.

517
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:07,940
And I'm glad I bought the dance pad now, because when I get back, Extreme will be out, and then I can play, you know, Extreme just fine, with the iToy mode and stuff.

518
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,940
Woot, woot. Woot, woot.

519
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,940
I'm sorry, no styling? What?

520
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:15,940
No styling says you can hear heavy breathing while playing DDR.

521
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:19,940
Actually, it's not that bad. Most people have the courtesy to move their microphone when they're playing,

522
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:24,300
but the ones that annoy me are like when you're playing colors and then like you

523
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:27,380
hear some little kid going

524
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:42,460
like and it's all like off-sake too it's it's horrible like it totally throws me

525
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:45,420
off too and the little kids sing along to the song but I was playing against a

526
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:49,840
thirty five-year-old mom today and she rocked she rocked everything so that was

527
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:55,920
fun yeah mom's are cool anyway so yes I'm not gonna be here next week because

528
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:01,000
I'm actually leaving for two weeks I'm going to Pennsylvania I'm going I'm more

529
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,720
open oh my god Rob I'm more open this time about talking about where I'm going

530
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:08,700
you have to go to the museum what museum the one on the top of the rocky steps oh

531
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:13,240
I'm not gonna be in Philadelphia that much I only go there for the airport the

532
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:17,200
place I'm at is like an hour north. But I am going to be very close to New Jersey

533
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:22,160
and I actually went on DDR Freak of all places and I went on a thread there that

534
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,000
talks about that area and they told me to check out an arcade right on the

535
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,520
state line of Jersey. So it's in some mall. So I'm gonna check that out while

536
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:32,920
I'm there and I'm gonna try. Take pictures. I'm gonna try and go to 8 on the break

537
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:36,520
in Jersey because they have In the Groove and I'm really curious about it.

538
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:40,320
Take your cam and take us lots of pictures. Yeah I've been kind of been a little

539
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:44,760
skeptical about it, but I feel like I can't really comment until I've played it. So I'm

540
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:48,760
going to play it, then I will come home and bash on it. No, I'm kidding. But we'll see

541
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:52,560
how it is. So I'm really curious about that one. So I will definitely probably make an

542
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:57,600
appearance at 8 on the break next weekend. This is what I'm aiming for, so we'll see.

543
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:01,280
Not that anybody cares. But it really depends on what my lesbian friend from college wants

544
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,880
to do, because she's going to be out there visiting me. And she's the bomb. And I don't

545
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:11,160
know how into DDR she is. I've decided after today, after playing so much DDR, I want to

546
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:19,280
go on the DDR diet. I want to be just like Tanya. Seriously, I'm going to take a picture

547
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,280
of my fat little gut here, and that'll be my before picture.

548
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,280
Okay, little as little.

549
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,280
Look, he's doing my trick.

550
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:30,480
Yeah, I'm doing Janae's trick. And then I'm going to play UltraMix 2 for like an hour

551
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:34,860
every day and then I'm gonna have a six pack and I'll be just like Tanya it'll

552
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:39,580
rock. She said Tanya doesn't have a six pack but you know close enough. But then Janae will bring the

553
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:43,720
pineapple cake over and spoil it for you. I know. Cuz I like those good. Cuz I have to be

554
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:47,980
good and eat good foods. You know I like big guts and I cannot lie. You know I remember when a second

555
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:51,080
mixes that you remember when I had it on Dreamcast way back when? Uh-huh. Back

556
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:56,360
before there was Vivid but you know I played it played non-stop mode for every

557
00:41:56,360 --> 00:42:02,600
day for like an hour and a half. And I lost a lot of weight that summer and gained it

558
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,680
all back. But anyway.

559
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:09,960
But see, I haven't really been into DDR for a long time. Like, I mean, I hate to admit

560
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:13,040
that when I've been doing this show for like, you know, two and a half years, but I, and

561
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:17,160
I blame that completely on lack of new arcade mixes. That's honestly what it is. I mean,

562
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:20,920
the home mixes have been great, but the problem is, is that, you know, my dance pad has been

563
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:25,480
broken for, you know, a long time. So I haven't really had an urge to play at home. The arcades

564
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:30,000
in my area sucks, so even if I want to go play a mix that's two years old now, you know,

565
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:35,320
I wouldn't really have a great place to do that at. So DDR has been kind of eh for me

566
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:38,680
lately. I still love the game, love the music. That's why I'm still motivated to do this

567
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:43,320
show. But I'm trying to get back into it.

568
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,320
We're the ORL now.

569
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,320
Anyway.

570
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,320
Alright.

571
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:50,320
Next thing you know we'll be the IRS.

572
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:55,320
But you know what? I'm actually since doing that interview for Lifetime.

573
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:59,320
That's right! What was this about? Tell us again.

574
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,320
Melody.

575
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:04,320
Melody, Sharks Girl, mentioned it last week. But what's this all about now? Give us more info.

576
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:13,320
Someone sent a message on to DDRFreak wanting to do an interview thing for Lifetime magazine.

577
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:19,000
And so, about, you know, fitness in DDR.

578
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:24,480
And so, she, you know, was referred to me and I did a little thing and she said, do

579
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:28,840
you have any friends who, you know, were using DDR for fitness and off the top of my head

580
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:34,560
I remembered Melody because she's got the solo machine, plays the leg weights and everything.

581
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,520
And I also talked about Orange Lounge.

582
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:37,520
Yay!

583
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,000
Oh my God.

584
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,280
We might be in Lifetime magazine, that would rock so hard.

585
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:46,280
It has a bunch of 40-year-old women listening to us.

586
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:47,280
Thank you.

587
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,280
F you, because I was watching...

588
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,280
Dude, Lifetime is cool.

589
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:52,280
I was watching Lifetime last night.

590
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,280
Golden Girls reruns, thank you very much.

591
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,280
Dude, Golden Girls reruns are awesome.

592
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,280
Golden Girls is the best show in the 80s.

593
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,280
Dude, any cable...

594
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,280
I want to be in Lifetime magazine.

595
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,280
Oh, I mentioned us.

596
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,280
That's alright.

597
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,280
You want to be Blanche on Golden Girls too, what's your point?

598
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,280
Shut up.

599
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:11,280
You know, if I were a Golden Girl, I'd probably end up being Sophia.

600
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:17,240
the bitter... I am so Bea Arthur, I'm so Dorothy, I'm the bitch

601
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:20,560
it's what it boils down to. So who would be Rose?

602
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:24,360
This is a sad time. It's a sad time when we start

603
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:27,520
comparing ourselves to the Golden Girl.

604
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:31,760
Anyway, yeah. We need to sit around the kitchen table and eat cheesecake. I think now would be a very good

605
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,360
time to go to a break before we... Did we skip Loki's week?

606
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:37,720
Did we? Oh yes we did. Sorry Loki.

607
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:42,320
Oh, he was over playing with a cam earlier. Who wants to hear about his week anyway?

608
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:45,400
Eh. Just kidding. Alright, Loki. How was your week? How was your day? Sorry, buddy.

609
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:48,760
Oh, nothing important happened at all.

610
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:52,440
You know, it's nothing at all. Yeah, boring.

611
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:56,720
Happy birthday to you.

612
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:02,160
Oh, don't feel bad. I had a disaster on my birthday, too.

613
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,920
Wait, I'm sorry. We need... I actually would like to have a moment of silence for

614
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:10,760
September 11th, 2001, when Loki turned 21.

615
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:11,760
Alright.

616
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:17,680
Okay, don't feel bad, because the whole Waco thing was on my birthday.

617
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:23,320
Yeah, but those were just crazy people in Texas.

618
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:27,080
Thousands of people died in my birthday.

619
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:28,080
That's cool.

620
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:29,080
Anyway.

621
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,080
How is that cool?

622
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:31,080
Not cool.

623
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:32,080
Yeah, whatever.

624
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,080
It's like a sacrifice for Loki.

625
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:36,080
I'm just pissed off that no one died on your birthday.

626
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:40,080
Anyways, I'm so glad we could have someone controversial on this program.

627
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:42,080
Somebody died on my birthday.

628
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:45,080
Lots of people died on everybody's birthday.

629
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:47,080
People die.

630
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:50,080
It happens on a daily, every day.

631
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:53,080
Hundreds of thousands of people die.

632
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:56,080
When you celebrate your birthday eat some damn cake.

633
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:59,080
I didn't eat cake, I had ice cream.

634
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:01,080
I'll give you some damn cake.

635
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:11,160
I don't want cake anywho no so it's just yeah I didn't do much I got what I get

636
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:16,640
for my birthday I got bedding for my birthday I got pillows new sheets and a

637
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:28,080
shaver and no one bought you socks no that was Christmas and then and I'll get

638
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:31,840
until later what happened more that day but things didn't happen that I wanted

639
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:35,740
to happen actually I'll just say it now I didn't get to go to Benihana's because

640
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:39,820
they're assholes but uh I'll talk about that later and that's coming up in the

641
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:46,040
effuse I'm sure it will be I wanted my goddamn teriyaki steak and shrimp

642
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:52,440
instead I was forced to have Olive Garden but that's okay that's all I

643
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,440
I don't really have much to say.

644
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,440
We'll be back

645
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,440
Yeah

646
00:49:52,440 --> 00:50:04,440
I need you, I want you, I will love to you

647
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:17,440
I need you, I want you, I will love to you

648
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,440
Yes

649
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,440
You

650
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:22,440
While I'm floating through, yeah

651
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:27,440
Love is love, love is love

652
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:33,440
And love, yeah

653
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:36,440
Come to the end, now

654
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:38,440
Come to the end, now

655
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:41,440
Come to the end, now

656
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:44,440
Come to the end, now

657
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:54,440
Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave

658
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:59,440
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave

Pixie Dust and I were getting down there during the break.

664
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,720
I actually don't remember that last song, but I really like it.

665
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:46,720
Lazenka, Save Us.

666
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:47,720
What was that from?

667
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:49,360
Uh, it's from Pump It Up, actually.

668
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,000
Well, you know how much Pump It Up I've learned.

669
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
I know.

00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Seagurd can help you out in the chatroom.

671
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,280
It's like his favorite Pump song ever.

You need to send me that.

673
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:56,280
Just ask Seagurd.

674
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:57,280
Oh my god.

00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:59,640

00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:20,540
week how was your day so you can get to know them a little better and we'll

680
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:23,700
Starting off with Didi Archaholic.

681
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:26,300
Oh my gosh, I'm not ready for this.

682
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:27,300
Hi everybody.

683
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:28,300
Hi.

684
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:29,300
Hi.

685
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:30,300
My week.

686
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:31,300
My week is not very eventful, usually.

687
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:35,340
I do a lot of working, so got that done.

688
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:36,340
Yesterday...

689
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:41,340
Nope, that's not working on you, that's right.

690
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:42,340
Oh no.

691
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:46,060
Oh, the dark child is showing you funny things on the camera now.

692
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:47,060
Anyway.

693
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:48,060
At least he's trying.

694
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:49,740
What did we do yesterday?

695
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:55,420
We had a little impromptu get-together last night, but it was wherever at my place.

696
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:58,740
I wanted to come, but I was on my period, so I'm sorry.

697
00:55:58,740 --> 00:55:59,740
I was too, so...

698
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:03,460
Suck it up and get the tampons!

699
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:05,940
No, seriously though, I was...

700
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:16,860
Yeah, it's our apartment, mine and Jason's, and we watched one episode, Episode 2 of Beautiful

701
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:22,860
life, and we just had lots of, um, somen noodles and snacks and stuff. Lots of fun.

702
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:23,860
Yeah.

703
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:24,860
Crab cream cheese wontons.

704
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:25,860
Crab cream cheese wontons.

705
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:26,860
I can talk.

706
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:32,140
Cream cheese wontons, yes. And that was really the highlight of my week so far until I got

707
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:33,140
here today.

708
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:34,140
Right on.

709
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:35,140
Yeah.

710
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:38,980
Now, um, I understand that you have a special presentation. You want to do it next, after

711
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:39,980
we finish off?

712
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:40,980
Uh, yeah, what do we...

713
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:41,980
Yeah, let's finish off.

714
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:42,980
Yeah, okay.

715
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:45,860
Let's finish this off, and then we'll get into a special presentation. Finish it off.

716
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:48,980
Angel, how was your week, how was your day?

717
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:52,580
Basically just school and working and um, oh!

718
00:56:52,580 --> 00:56:55,980
We signed up for high speed finally. It's about time.

719
00:56:55,980 --> 00:57:01,420
Hey! Like it was my fault. Yeah so we should get it like tomorrow or Tuesday

720
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:03,100
so I'm like really stoked about that. I'm like

721
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:07,140
finally after two months I can actually be back on high speed

722
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:10,220
which means I can play Ragnarok with JB and

723
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:14,180
and and probably Final Fantasy XI with you too. Yay!

724
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:16,180
Uh-oh. I feel an A-word coming on.

725
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:18,180
Ahem!

726
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:20,180
Oh, great. Oh, yeah.

727
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:23,180
I also got the PlayStation, Xbox converter thing.

728
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:25,180
So I can use my ignition to play...

729
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:26,180
Look what I bought. Look what I bought today.

730
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:27,180
I know!

731
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:29,180
I just saw that. I'm like, oh, that reminded me.

732
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:32,180
Janae, what are you doing with the camera?

733
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:35,180
I think this calls for another appearance of Ignition Pad Man.

734
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:37,180
Oh, no, it's Ignition Pad Woman!

735
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:39,180
Your newest Silent Hill character.

736
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:41,180
Ignition Pad Head Man.

737
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:48,180
Alright, so yeah, I can play Ultramix now with a pad, and what the hell is Janine doing?

738
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:50,180
She's an ignition pad woman.

739
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:54,180
Roar! Yeah, it smells like plastic in there.

740
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:59,180
You should have seen the ignition pad when we unwrapped it. It had that new pad smell.

741
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:05,180
Oh my god, it's ignition total! Wait a minute. Alright, I'll shut up. Who's next?

742
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:06,180
Darkchild's next.

743
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:10,180
Wherever he went. Ah, there he is. Hello!

744
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:16,180
My week was uneventful. I have a back injury. I don't get to do much.

745
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:21,180
Monday I saw my chiropractor. Wednesday I saw my chiropractor.

746
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:24,180
Friday I saw my chiropractor.

747
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:29,180
That's about all I do now is I see my chiropractor. It's very boring.

748
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:31,180
And then he works that corner for me every once in a while.

749
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:32,180
Very, very boring.

750
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:35,180
What about that little story you told me? That was pretty funny.

751
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:37,180
Oh, about the big gas bubble in my stomach?

752
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:38,180
That's right.

753
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:42,700
a big gas bubble in my stomach and it wouldn't come out and I tried everything

754
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:45,980
I tried to force the burp out and it wouldn't come out so I drank some tea

755
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:50,760
and like this big burp exploded out of me and it was crazy and it felt really

756
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:55,860
good but it hurt my throat that was the high point of my week Wow

757
00:58:55,860 --> 00:59:03,300
my week is exciting so exciting you forgot one thing though what your trick

758
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:05,300
Which trick that you taught me?

759
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:07,300
Which trick?

760
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:09,300
Oh, the...

761
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:11,300
Yeah, that's right.

762
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:13,300
For the rest of my week, I watched Cops.

763
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:15,300
And apparently the new thing is if you're going to start shit with someone,

764
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:17,300
you lift up your shirt and show your stomach to them.

765
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:21,300
I don't know why that's aggressive, but...

766
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:23,300
And you lean back.

767
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:25,300
The cops are getting worried.

768
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:27,300
Yeah, you gotta lean back and lift the shirt up.

769
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:29,300
Hand the crotch, you know.

770
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:31,300
I'll get you guys a webcam in a minute.

771
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:37,780
the whole Japanese expression to split your gut maybe maybe it's like that but

772
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:41,260
I don't think the idiots would have caught on with a Japanese expression I

773
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:47,020
mean these are the ghetto people that's like show your gut yeah so that's it I'm

774
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:57,020
very boring now so yeah all right okay now that we've caught up everybody on

775
00:59:57,020 --> 01:00:00,660
how is their week how is their day let's um let's have Anita Anita wants to do a

776
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:04,460
special presentation. DD Archaholic has a special presentation. Tell us about your special

777
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:10,180
presentation. Well, this is all about yesterday. Everyone knows about what special day yesterday

778
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:17,180
was, right? Yes, do this on the cam, please. Okay. Yesterday was 9-11 day, yes. Moving

779
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:24,500
up, I'm glad the mic didn't pick that up. And I have prepared a gift basket for the

780
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:28,580
birthday boy. Oh, birthday boy who gets a gift basket. Here's our gift basket. Yes,

781
01:00:28,580 --> 01:00:32,580
Yes, do it in front of the webcam, please, and hold up each item so our chatters can see.

782
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:36,580
All right, here's a little card.

783
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:41,580
All right, in this gift basket, we have a collection of Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen items,

784
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:45,580
starting with a Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen DVD.

785
01:00:45,580 --> 01:00:47,580
It's called Greatest Parties.

786
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:52,580
It's one of their younger DVDs where they're probably only about 12 years old, I think.

787
01:00:52,580 --> 01:01:02,400
think. And also there's a graphic novel that somewhat resembles the adult reading that

788
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:03,400
you might find.

789
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:04,400
There's a porn here.

790
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:11,140
There is a little porn here. We have a calendar and in this calendar for the month of September

791
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:21,040
you may find a little surprise. Something that may not be viewable on the webcam, but

792
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:28,580
We have Mary Kate and Ashley, actually finally got naked for the camera, finally, especially

793
01:01:28,580 --> 01:01:30,420
for Matt for September.

794
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:37,740
They got very naked, and also, actually, they got a little frisky in October, so October,

795
01:01:37,740 --> 01:01:40,420
the Halloween month, some more surprises for you.

796
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:48,160
Also, in the gift basket, we have a small bottle of KY Jelly that is for any intimate

797
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:55,520
the moments that you may need, and a tube sock to accompany those intimate moments.

798
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:59,900
We also have a bag of candy so that you can lure any other young individuals that you

799
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:06,920
may want to accompany you, and a small bottle of Jack Daniels that will also help relax

800
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:07,920
the children.

801
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:11,720
In a Michael Jackson sort of way.

802
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:20,020
forgot to put the label Jesus Juice on there. I forgot. Oh, and a small package of brush

803
01:02:20,020 --> 01:02:25,900
ups, oral B brush ups for brushing yourself off, or the kids when they're finished. That

804
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:31,960
is the most awesome birthday gift I've ever seen. Molester in a box. That's the best. Yeah,

805
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:37,260
it was from the pedophile section at Wal-Mart. That was fucking hilarious. That was great.

806
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:41,700

819
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:30,800
You know what?

820
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:32,600
We haven't heard from someone in a little bit.

821
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:33,100
Who?

822
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:36,720
All right, let's take a call.

823
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:37,720
We got a call coming in.

824
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:39,320
Hello, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.

825
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:42,320
Yeah. Legend of Zaku here.

826
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:45,320
Can't hear you, buddy. Talk loud into the mic.

827
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:46,320
Hey, what's up?

828
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:48,320
This is me, the Legend of Zaku.

829
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:49,320
What's up, Zaku?

830
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:54,320
Yes, this is kind of like directed to Loki because I live through the hell of September 11th.

831
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:57,320
Hold on, he's laughing at the porno calendar. Hold on a minute.

832
01:03:57,320 --> 01:04:00,320
Zaku has something he wants to say to you, Loki.

833
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:04,320
Alright, Loki. Since you basically, you know, I don't know, for some reason,

834
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:08,320
I kind of like feel almost offended, but not all the way.

835
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:20,320
It doesn't matter that I am an actual New Yorker. I've lived for 11th. My school was evacuated on that day. I managed to get a glimpse of the towers while they were crumbling.

836
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:30,320
So, in other words, just be respectful, sensitive, all that. Celebrate your birthday, but keep in mind of what happened. That's all.

837
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:32,320
So you were only halfway offended?

838
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:34,320
Halfway, not like what, 25%?

839
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:36,320
You're not trying hard enough!

840
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:37,320
Oh, please.

841
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:50,320
In all seriousness though, just remember that September 11th was a hard day for everybody and I realize especially those folks are in that area but I think everybody in one way or another knew somebody that was somehow affected by those attacks.

842
01:04:50,320 --> 01:05:06,320
But just remember, we are equal opportunity offenders here on the radio and the way that some of us deal with crisis like I'm the type of person that laughs at a funeral, and I would hope that people have bring a stand up comic to my funeral, because I want people to laugh when they remember me so you know obviously it was a tragic day.

843
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:09,140
uh... but sometimes

844
01:05:09,140 --> 01:05:13,580
sometimes the best way to work through something to make fun of it

845
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:15,920
well we'll work on that we'll work on it

846
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:17,020
just a little pointer

847
01:05:17,020 --> 01:05:20,480
we'll work on the top just be a little sensitive that's all we'll work on the

848
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:23,720
totally offensive thing for a later date

849
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:25,180
alright anything else you want to share with us aku?

850
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:29,800
can you at least bash bin laden or something

851
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:33,760
do some bashing against those oh that's so used though that's so trendy

852
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:35,900
everybody bashes bin laden

853
01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:37,660
I'll bash bin Laden.

854
01:05:37,660 --> 01:05:40,700
Goddamn Bush family, forgive him bin Laden.

855
01:05:40,700 --> 01:05:45,740
President Bush would be killed his entire family if it wasn't for them Osama wouldn't live.

856
01:05:45,740 --> 01:05:47,620
Thank you, dark child. Alright.

857
01:05:47,620 --> 01:05:49,740
Was that acceptable?

858
01:05:49,740 --> 01:05:52,340
Actually, you could...

859
01:05:52,340 --> 01:05:53,700
Whatever, I know.

860
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:54,760
I'll let it go.

861
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:57,940
Alright, we're going to let you go, bud.

862
01:05:57,940 --> 01:05:59,420
I know what we're going to do.

863
01:05:59,420 --> 01:06:01,620
We're going to let you go, bud. Have a good one.

864
01:06:01,620 --> 01:06:05,340
I know what we're going to do when Loki kicks the bucket. What's that?

865
01:06:05,340 --> 01:06:12,300
We're gonna like take him to a taxidermist and put him in one of those, like, poses.

866
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:17,460
Or put him up with, like, some, you know, laminated bacon or something.

867
01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:21,420
Loki is the type of person that when he dies, he's gonna want to be buried face down so

868
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:23,100
the whole world can kiss his ass.

869
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:24,100
Okay, you...

870
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:26,180
Okay, I know where that came from.

871
01:06:26,180 --> 01:06:28,260
No, no, no, no, no.

872
01:06:28,260 --> 01:06:32,340
I would have to be ground up and thrown into some sort of fast food.

873
01:06:32,340 --> 01:06:35,180
Or just recycling.

874
01:06:35,180 --> 01:06:40,980
Or, or, or my ashes could like, I don't know, be used in a charcoal, you know, grill or

875
01:06:40,980 --> 01:06:41,980
something.

876
01:06:41,980 --> 01:06:43,620
Wasn't that in an episode of Married with Children?

877
01:06:43,620 --> 01:06:44,620
Yes it was.

878
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:47,320
The Skype line is still up on everybody.

879
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:49,320
Oh, and we're getting a call.

880
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:50,780
Howdy, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

881
01:06:50,780 --> 01:06:52,380
Hey, it is Dark Knight.

882
01:06:52,380 --> 01:06:53,780
Hey, Dark Knight, what's on your mind?

883
01:06:53,780 --> 01:06:54,780
Hi, Dark Knight.

884
01:06:54,780 --> 01:06:55,780
Nothing.

885
01:06:55,780 --> 01:06:57,780
Just something for Loki about his B-Day.

886
01:06:57,780 --> 01:06:58,780
Yeah.

887
01:06:58,780 --> 01:06:59,780
Dude.

888
01:06:59,780 --> 01:07:00,780
Dude.

889
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:01,780
Dude.

890
01:07:01,780 --> 01:07:02,780
The calendar.

891
01:07:02,780 --> 01:07:03,780
The calendar was awesome, wasn't it?

892
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:06,180
That was just totally wrong.

893
01:07:06,180 --> 01:07:09,500
Didi Archaholic actually gets the credit for the calendar.

894
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:13,740
She spent her hours photoshopping that and making her however she did it with scissors

895
01:07:13,740 --> 01:07:14,740
and tape.

896
01:07:14,740 --> 01:07:15,740
I don't know.

897
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:20,380
Sorry she did a good job but dude step away from the calendar that's all I gotta say.

898
01:07:20,380 --> 01:07:22,940
We're all going to hell what can we say.

899
01:07:22,940 --> 01:07:24,420
We'll see you there bud.

900
01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:26,620
Welcome to the hand basket.

901
01:07:26,620 --> 01:07:31,780
Soon enough we won't have to photoshop that soon enough it's a matter it will be within

902
01:07:31,780 --> 01:07:37,780
my last time in fact it will be within the next few years okay soon enough hey

903
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:43,660
dark knight it's angel oh never mind I'm just saying hi to him anyway he'll

904
01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:47,740
probably say hi to the chat room anyway okay I have one thing to say to Loki a

905
01:07:47,740 --> 01:08:01,060
knight with Mary Kate oh you know what what I just I don't see how so many

906
01:08:01,060 --> 01:08:07,180
people are all like getting all hot and bothered over them when a good number of

907
01:08:07,180 --> 01:08:13,020
us screw up watching them in diapers it's not a matter that it's more see my

908
01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:16,860
whole hoping that they go to porn it's not because of them it's because of my

909
01:08:16,860 --> 01:08:22,180
hatred for full house okay I hate that show so much and she is basically the

910
01:08:22,180 --> 01:08:26,560
epitome of full house I want to see her fail if that means you know they have to

911
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:31,840
get hit by a train or do porn, I just want to see them fail. And porn seems to be the

912
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:35,360
best route because not only do they fail, but I get to see them naked.

913
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:40,120
I have the same hatred towards John Stan and I like it.

914
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:44,520
You know, Loki, Hugh Hefner already has pictures of them in his private collection. It's just

915
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:47,120
a matter of time before they get published.

916
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:52,480
It's all about time. Anyways.

917
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:55,480
So yeah, that game with the arrows and the stomping.

918
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:58,480
Yeah, to DDR.

919
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:00,480
What game is that?

920
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:02,480
DDR News or something going on?

921
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:03,480
We'll get to it in a minute.

922
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:07,480
Zaku is calling back, even though I usually don't take calls twice from the same person as Sho.

923
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:08,480
I'll give him a second chance.

924
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:09,480
Just a real quick call.

925
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:11,480
Alright, what's up?

926
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:16,480
Alright, I have an idea for when Loki passes to the next world.

927
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:19,480
Why don't you just bury him upside down in the casket?

928
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:23,740
And then just, you know, after he's buried, you just go that night to the cemetery, dig

929
01:09:23,740 --> 01:09:28,240
up his corpse, and then take it back to your place, throw it around, put, like, panties

930
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:30,940
on it, high heels, dance with it.

931
01:09:30,940 --> 01:09:31,940
And then fuck it!

932
01:09:31,940 --> 01:09:33,940
That's too much work, Logan.

933
01:09:33,940 --> 01:09:35,380
Dude, that is fucking awesome.

934
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:39,300
I want you to re-dig me up when I'm dead, and then just, like, put me in a Hawaiian

935
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:41,340
shirt with glasses like Bernie.

936
01:09:41,340 --> 01:09:42,340
That's fucking awesome.

937
01:09:42,340 --> 01:09:43,340
We get the Bernie style.

938
01:09:43,340 --> 01:09:44,340
We're gonna bury...

939
01:09:44,340 --> 01:09:45,340
Tiki-wara skiing.

940
01:09:45,340 --> 01:09:47,340
We're going to bury Loki in brawn panties.

941
01:09:47,340 --> 01:09:49,340
That is so cool.

942
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:51,340
Alright, bud. Thanks for the call.

943
01:09:51,340 --> 01:09:55,340
I'm going to try... Oh, I missed the other guy that was calling in.

944
01:09:55,340 --> 01:09:57,340
Uh oh.

945
01:09:57,340 --> 01:10:01,340
Darn it. Call back, person that was trying to call because we just missed it.

946
01:10:01,340 --> 01:10:05,340
Knowing Loki, he'd probably dig his way out of his own coffin anyway.

947
01:10:05,340 --> 01:10:09,340
He's too stubborn to die.

948
01:10:09,340 --> 01:10:11,340
Too mean to die.

949
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:13,340
My boyfriend's back.

950
01:10:13,340 --> 01:10:23,460
I'm a little upset with Rice Princess and Lanky Style, I thought they were going to

951
01:10:23,460 --> 01:10:24,460
be here tonight.

952
01:10:24,460 --> 01:10:30,420
They were supposed to bring me that copy of Harvest Moon so I could take it to Pennsylvania.

953
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:31,420
Bitches!

954
01:10:31,420 --> 01:10:32,420
That's alright.

955
01:10:32,420 --> 01:10:34,980
It's alright Angel, I'll play it when I get back.

956
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:37,100
We'll just have to work it off Rice Princess's ass.

957
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:39,460
I'll do that on Tuesday.

958
01:10:39,460 --> 01:10:40,460
Alright.

959
01:10:40,460 --> 01:10:41,460
Oh yeah.

960
01:10:41,460 --> 01:10:42,460
Sounds hot.

961
01:10:42,460 --> 01:10:46,460
I'm waiting to see if that person calls us back on Skype. Should I just call them?

962
01:10:46,460 --> 01:10:49,820
Why not? Go for it. Alright, I'm just gonna call them.

963
01:10:49,820 --> 01:10:55,300
Oh! Oh, they're calling back. Hello! You're on Orange Lounge. Hello.

964
01:10:55,300 --> 01:10:58,980
Hello, how's it going? Hi, who's this? El Mullet.

965
01:10:58,980 --> 01:11:03,180
Hello, El Mullet! How are you? I'm doing good, Sky. How about yourself?

966
01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:06,940
Good! Hey, I was playing El Mullet earlier today on DDR Ultra Maker.

967
01:11:06,940 --> 01:11:11,700
El Mullet has the coolest nickname ever. Because, you know, the mullet's making a comeback.

968
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:16,700
Oh yes it is. And the funniest thing is, I'm not Mexican, and I don't have a mullet.

969
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:18,700
So why the name?

970
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:25,700
I don't know. It was on Bimani style. There was, like, on the umpteenth, um...

971
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:30,700
Ask a stupid question, get a stupid answer thread, and it's like, what if the mullet would make a comeback?

972
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:35,700
And I'm saying, yes, I always wanted to grow a mullet. No I don't.

973
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:38,700
What if I really wanted to grow a mullet? And then someone replied,

974
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:42,700
Well, you'll grow one and then we'd call you El Mullet.

975
01:11:42,700 --> 01:11:44,700
And thereby hangs the tail.

976
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:46,700
People get their nicknames in very strange ways.

977
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:50,700
Next on Meeting Rainbow.

978
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:54,700
I actually got to play El Mullet earlier today in UltraMix and he schooled me on Ready Steady Go.

979
01:11:54,700 --> 01:11:56,700
He just kicked my ass.

980
01:11:56,700 --> 01:11:58,700
Because of those damn tempo changes.

981
01:11:58,700 --> 01:11:59,700
You got me on colors.

982
01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:01,700
Yeah, I beat him on colors.

983
01:12:01,700 --> 01:12:03,700
It must be the mullet magic.

984
01:12:03,700 --> 01:12:06,400
You know the most hilarious thing that happened on Ultramix today though?

985
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:09,500
Some guy on a controller freaking triple-a'd his song

986
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:14,300
and then we got into another match and it was the same freaking song

987
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:18,100
and I triple-a'd it and beat him. I triple-a'd it on a pad, I was so happy.

988
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:21,000
Granted it was a light song but hey, I'm still cool.

989
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:24,460
You may or may not get to play with me this week. As we all are in our own little

990
01:12:24,460 --> 01:12:27,740
internet way. I may not because I'm going to Pennsylvania. Anyway, I'm sorry.

991
01:12:27,740 --> 01:12:31,300
Elmo, why did you call us tonight anyway? I just wanted to

992
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:35,300
Well you say that this show is probably the most screwed up show I've ever listened to

993
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:36,300
and it rocks because of that.

994
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:37,300
Thank you.

995
01:12:37,300 --> 01:12:38,300
That is such a compliment.

996
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:39,300
Thank you.

997
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:40,300
That really warms our hearts.

998
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:45,100
Actually, Elle Mullet likes to plug our little show on the site of his, so would you like

999
01:12:45,100 --> 01:12:47,300
to plug your site here on our show, Elle Mullet?

1000
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:48,300
Yes I would.

1001
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:49,300
www.insidepulse.com.

1002
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:56,300
It's an entertainment website with a bunch of different areas, video games, movies, TV.

1003
01:12:56,300 --> 01:12:58,300
Is there an adult section?

1004
01:12:58,300 --> 01:12:59,300
No, but there's Rasslin.

1005
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:00,300
Cool.

1006
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:01,600
Yes, there's Rasslin.

1007
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:03,600
Cool, my favorite male soap opera.

1008
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:07,600
I tip my diet chocolate soda to you.

1009
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:09,800
And you can read the cookie story on this site.

1010
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:13,600
The El Mullet was the one that sent the cookies, which we talked about a couple weeks ago.

1011
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:16,600
Yes, I will be forever heralded as the Cookie Man.

1012
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:17,600
The Cookie Monster!

1013
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:18,600
Cookie Man!

1014
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:20,600
Alright.

1015
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:29,100
And the most hilarious thing is, as soon as I hang up, I can listen to what I just said thanks to lag.

1016
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:33,300
I know it's great. Hey, actually our chat room wants to know, are you high?

1017
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:37,780
Am I high? You sound really laid back.

1018
01:13:37,780 --> 01:13:41,180
Well I figured if I sounded like a nervous

1019
01:13:41,180 --> 01:13:45,060
pussy bitch... He's the mullet, dude! He's the mullet!

1020
01:13:45,060 --> 01:13:48,060
We'll make sure to ship you that box of Twinkies. Mullet's a laid back.

1021
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:52,060
I know that No Silence sounds really like he's high all the time.

1022
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:56,100
Actually we may be shipping something to El Mullet soon because El Mullet

1023
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:58,060
would be eligible to win our contest.

1024
01:13:58,060 --> 01:14:02,060
Did you know we're having a contest, El Mullet? You're having a contest? Yes, actually we

1025
01:14:02,060 --> 01:14:03,540
haven't announced this to anybody yet,

1026
01:14:03,540 --> 01:14:07,820
but we're going to right after the break. You better stay tuned.

1027
01:14:07,820 --> 01:14:11,940
It is a huge contest. Multiple websites are involved in this contest,

1028
01:14:11,940 --> 01:14:16,100
coming together. It's going to be hot, so hot. It's just going to be

1029
01:14:16,100 --> 01:14:19,100
too hot for normal radio, that's why it's here.

1030
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:23,380
All right, Mullet. You will need new pants after you hear about this contest.

1031
01:14:23,380 --> 01:14:26,860
Thanks for the call, Mullet. We appreciate it,

1032
01:14:26,860 --> 01:14:28,860
And we hope to hear from you again soon, bud.

1033
01:14:28,860 --> 01:14:29,860
Hope to see you on all tracks.

1034
01:14:29,860 --> 01:14:32,860
And I'm going to kick your ass when I get back from Pennsylvania.

1035
01:14:32,860 --> 01:14:33,860
Doh!

1036
01:14:33,860 --> 01:14:34,860
All right, later.

1037
01:14:34,860 --> 01:14:35,860
Later.

1038
01:14:35,860 --> 01:14:36,860
Bye.

1039
01:14:36,860 --> 01:14:38,860
All right, we're going to close the Skype line for now.

1040
01:14:38,860 --> 01:14:39,860
We're going to go to a break.

1041
01:14:39,860 --> 01:14:46,860
And in this break, there should be a little bit of a hint on what this contest is all about.

1042
01:14:46,860 --> 01:14:50,260
We will talk more about the contest when we come back boys and girls

1043
01:15:16,860 --> 01:15:21,860
.

1044
01:15:21,860 --> 01:15:26,860
.

1045
01:15:26,860 --> 01:15:31,860
.

1046
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:36,860
.

1047
01:15:36,860 --> 01:15:41,860
.

1048
01:16:11,860 --> 01:16:16,860
Yeah.

1049
01:16:16,860 --> 01:16:21,860
Yeah.

1050
01:16:21,860 --> 01:16:26,860
Yeah.

1051
01:16:26,860 --> 01:16:31,860
Yeah.

1052
01:16:31,860 --> 01:16:36,860
Yeah.

1053
01:18:36,860 --> 01:18:39,360
This is my construct

1054
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:42,860
This is my construct

1055
01:18:54,860 --> 01:18:56,860
I'm a youtuber, yeah

1056
01:18:56,860 --> 01:19:00,860
I'm a youtuber, yeah

1057
01:19:00,860 --> 01:19:03,860
I'm a youtuber, yeah

1058
01:19:03,860 --> 01:19:06,860
Alright, yeah

1059
01:19:07,860 --> 01:19:10,860
You are the king of us, yeah

1060
01:19:10,860 --> 01:19:14,860
No one but you, yeah

1061
01:19:14,860 --> 01:19:18,860
No one but you, alright

1062
01:19:19,860 --> 01:19:21,860
I can't lie, I'm the killer

1063
01:19:22,860 --> 01:19:25,860
I am the wicked guy

1064
01:19:26,860 --> 01:19:28,860
I can't lie, I'm the killer

1065
01:19:28,860 --> 01:19:31,860
I am the wicked guy

1066
01:19:31,860 --> 01:19:33,860
I

1067
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:51,620
Hi ho, Kermit the Frog here informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

1068
01:20:51,620 --> 01:21:00,980
is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

1069
01:21:00,980 --> 01:21:05,500
We are back here on Orange Ons Radio, and as you probably figured out, that was a break

1070
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:07,780
all about a Kiryamoka music.

1071
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:16,140
Yes, the contest does have something to do with a Kiryamoka, so drum roll please.

1072
01:21:16,140 --> 01:21:21,800
We are going to be giving away, along with our buddies over at DDRSpot.com, they are

1073
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:26,880
relaunching next month, and as part of their kickoff, that site and ourselves, we are going

1074
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:33,160
to be giving away, between the two sites, four autographed Akira Yomoka Silent Hill

1075
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:38,520
4 mini discs. So these are Silent Hill 4 soundtracks, basically, little mini soundtracks, that

1076
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:43,000
have been autographed by the man himself, Akira Yomoka. We are giving those away. If

1077
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:47,840
you are an Akira Yomoka fan, you want this shit, so you're going to have to listen to

1078
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:53,260
the station lots to be eligible. We're giving away two, and we're going to give them away

1079
01:21:53,260 --> 01:22:01,360
across two weeks starting on the week of September 27th. September 27th is the

1080
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:06,520
first week so how do you win? Well the way you're gonna win is that on Monday

1082
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:16,480
show outside the box we will ask one trivia question about a Kiryamoka. You

1083
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:21,360
have until Sunday night show to send us the answer and then we will pick a

1084
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:27,480
Random entry live on Sunday night show and get ourselves a winner for the contest and special

1085
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:34,880
Thanks to our buddy float walk over at a kd a a kd a a and do your spot calm who has helped us?

1086
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:38,820
Get this and we'll be assisting in mailing out the prizes to our winners

1087
01:22:39,460 --> 01:22:45,660
Unfortunately, there's a downside to this if you have visited orange lounge radio live and in person three times or more

1088
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:48,380
You are considered a frequent guest and therefore

1089
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:52,940
What if it was like less than three times this year?

1090
01:22:52,940 --> 01:22:56,340
No, three times or more, you are frequent guests, therefore you are ineligible.

1091
01:22:56,340 --> 01:22:57,860
What if I get you a hooker?

1092
01:22:57,860 --> 01:23:00,100
I'm sorry, we had to draw the line somewhere.

1093
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:01,100
But here's the good news.

1094
01:23:01,100 --> 01:23:02,100
What if I suck your balls?

1095
01:23:02,100 --> 01:23:03,500
Here's the good news.

1096
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:04,500
Maybe then.

1097
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:05,500
That hooker being Jason.

1098
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:06,500
Here's the good news.

1099
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:11,420
You guys can win DDR spots CDs if you want, because you're not affiliated with them.

1100
01:23:11,420 --> 01:23:12,820
But I know the founder of DDR spots.

1101
01:23:12,820 --> 01:23:16,180
Likewise, DDR spot folks would be eligible for ours.

1102
01:23:16,180 --> 01:23:17,980
But I know the founder of DDR spots.

1103
01:23:17,980 --> 01:23:28,620
know well maybe you can put out or something I don't know all right so so

1104
01:23:28,620 --> 01:23:32,380
there will be one question across three different shows so that means you're

1105
01:23:32,380 --> 01:23:37,220
gonna have to listen every night or you can have friends listen and share the

1106
01:23:37,220 --> 01:23:40,900
questions but just remember if you go sharing the questions with everybody

1107
01:23:40,900 --> 01:23:44,060
that's more people who are gonna enter themselves in the contest so strategize

1108
01:23:44,060 --> 01:23:48,540
However, you want I mix I'm actually expecting that only a few people are going to enter

1109
01:23:48,540 --> 01:23:52,900
But I want the die-hard fans of the station to have first crack at it

1110
01:23:52,900 --> 01:23:57,060
And that's the best thing I could come up with it all like the apprentice only those that

1111
01:23:57,660 --> 01:24:04,040
Listen to all the shows are going to have a chance otherwise you fired, but but I was such a die-hard fan

1112
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:09,300
I came and visited the show board at three times all right you get you get to experience all

1113
01:24:09,300 --> 01:24:13,740
O-L-R live and in person and we put out for you.

1114
01:24:13,740 --> 01:24:14,740
Fire.

1115
01:24:14,740 --> 01:24:18,580
You don't autograph CDs for me.

1116
01:24:18,580 --> 01:24:22,000
I will take a poo and autograph it for you.

1117
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:25,060
Sweet, is that going to be on air today?

1118
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:26,060
Yes.

1119
01:24:26,060 --> 01:24:27,060
All right.

1120
01:24:27,060 --> 01:24:29,960
They're putting everything else on DVD, they may as well put us on there.

1121
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:38,340
Complete rules to come later on our website, however, just wanted to get that out there.

1122
01:24:38,340 --> 01:24:40,020
We also need a clever name for the contest.

1123
01:24:40,020 --> 01:24:41,860
We don't have a name for the contest yet, but.

1124
01:24:41,860 --> 01:24:44,540
Win Prize, all of our stuff.

1125
01:24:44,540 --> 01:24:47,100
Answer question, win prize.

1126
01:24:47,100 --> 01:24:49,540
Ask questions, win prize.

1127
01:24:49,540 --> 01:24:52,460
It's the answer question, win prize segment.

1128
01:24:52,460 --> 01:24:54,300
So, but it's questions.

1129
01:24:54,300 --> 01:24:55,540
Question the answer you have.

1130
01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:05,420
I like also the idea of win a piece of Akira.

1131
01:25:05,420 --> 01:25:05,940
No.

1132
01:25:05,940 --> 01:25:07,580
That'd be Jamie's department.

1133
01:25:07,580 --> 01:25:09,580
Alright. We'll see.

1134
01:25:10,580 --> 01:25:12,580
Alright, so, uh...

1135
01:25:13,580 --> 01:25:16,580
Hopefully... Jamie, you're having way too much fun in our chat room, there.

1136
01:25:16,580 --> 01:25:18,580
It's not just me!

1137
01:25:18,580 --> 01:25:21,580
Over at www.orangessongsradio.com, clicking on chat.

1138
01:25:23,580 --> 01:25:33,580
You can see, uh, me and, uh, Segerd, uh, use, uh, Akira Yamaoka lyrics to, uh, describe the multiple ways that we will be enjoying his presence.

1139
01:25:33,580 --> 01:25:40,580
Seegerd is very upset because he's ineligible because he's been to the show like four times.

1140
01:25:40,580 --> 01:25:43,580
El Mullet cannot have poo. Only me.

1141
01:25:43,580 --> 01:25:49,580
Oh, I like that idea. The next best thing to sex with Akira contest.

1142
01:25:49,580 --> 01:25:52,580
I'll win that.

1143
01:25:52,580 --> 01:25:55,580
The next best thing to being a faghead with Akira contest.

1144
01:25:55,580 --> 01:25:57,580
I don't know. I'm just tired.

1145
01:25:57,580 --> 01:26:08,580
Let's talk about some Bamani news that came out this week, and actually, as far as like platform news, like UltraMix 2 and ExtremeGo, there really hasn't been any developments.

1146
01:26:08,580 --> 01:26:14,580
We got a new UltraMix 2 clue, but uh, don't know what that's all about. Sorry guys, we don't have any more hints for you.

1147
01:26:14,580 --> 01:26:17,580
Was there a song unveiled that I completely forgot about?

1148
01:26:17,580 --> 01:26:19,580
Uh...

1149
01:26:19,580 --> 01:26:24,060
Oh yeah, and I promised everybody we'd play it as well, so we better do that.

1150
01:26:24,060 --> 01:26:27,060
We did have that one song that was unveiled, I totally forgot about that because I played

1151
01:26:27,060 --> 01:26:28,860
it Wednesday.

1152
01:26:28,860 --> 01:26:34,300
I remember, we did have one new licensed song, well technically it's not a license, it's

1153
01:26:34,300 --> 01:26:39,660
one of those, they haven't really said where they got the song yet, but Day Behavior is

1154
01:26:39,660 --> 01:26:44,320
the band, and the song is Superstar, and it's the Nevaraca mix.

1155
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:47,740
It's a seven minute song, I'm gonna play you guys like a two, three minute clip so you

1156
01:26:47,740 --> 01:26:48,740
can get a feel for it.

1157
01:26:48,740 --> 01:26:52,420
So I really like this song by the way, and you're going to be dancing to it this November

1158
01:27:48,740 --> 01:28:00,740
I was picked up for a TV show, it's called P24

1159
01:28:00,740 --> 01:28:07,740
I am the girl that you all know, to love, hate or adore

1160
01:28:07,740 --> 01:28:13,740
I've been waiting all my life, just to be seen

1161
01:28:13,740 --> 01:28:16,740
Seen by everyone

1162
01:28:16,740 --> 01:28:19,740
I want it to be someone

1163
01:28:20,740 --> 01:28:23,740
I'm the super star

1164
01:28:23,740 --> 01:28:26,740
Longing to be seen

1165
01:28:26,740 --> 01:28:30,740
I'm the super girl

1166
01:28:30,740 --> 01:28:33,740
On your secret screen

1167
01:28:33,740 --> 01:28:37,740
Like a superstar

1168
01:28:37,740 --> 01:28:40,740
Wanting everything

1169
01:28:40,740 --> 01:28:44,740
I'm the super girl

1170
01:28:44,740 --> 01:28:47,240
I'll do anything

1171
01:29:14,740 --> 01:29:25,740
I said goodbye to a lightning ray I lived to a colorful day

1172
01:29:25,740 --> 01:29:32,740
Fancy cars and pretty boys Isn't it wonderful day?

1173
01:29:32,740 --> 01:29:41,740
Finally I'm here in front of everyone And it just begun

1174
01:29:41,740 --> 01:29:44,740
I'm not just anyone

1175
01:29:45,740 --> 01:29:48,740
I'm the super star

1176
01:29:48,740 --> 01:29:51,740
Longing to be seen

1177
01:29:52,740 --> 01:29:55,740
I'm the super girl

1178
01:29:55,740 --> 01:29:58,740
On your secret screen

1179
01:29:59,740 --> 01:30:02,740
Like a superstar

1180
01:30:02,740 --> 01:30:05,740
Wanting everything

1181
01:30:06,740 --> 01:30:09,740
I'm the super girl

1182
01:30:09,740 --> 01:30:13,740
I'll do anything

1183
01:30:39,740 --> 01:30:43,060
I'm a tiny bit disappointed the original wasn't the one that was used, because I actually

1184
01:30:43,060 --> 01:30:44,060
like the original.

1185
01:30:44,060 --> 01:30:55,460
Let me play a little clip of the original.

1186
01:30:55,460 --> 01:30:56,460
Okay cause like-

1187
01:30:56,460 --> 01:30:57,460
That sounds like old DDR stuff.

1188
01:30:57,460 --> 01:30:58,460
Right.

1189
01:30:58,460 --> 01:31:03,660
When I first heard that Day Behavior Superstar was going to be in DDR, I actually got that

1190
01:31:03,660 --> 01:31:07,400
one thinking that that was the mix, but it's not.

1191
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:08,400
It's actually that remix.

1192
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:12,960
to check out the original tooth you have a chance I'm really liking this synth

1193
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:16,560
pop direction the Ultramix 2 is going in between this and echo image and

1194
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:22,920
everything so I don't know what do you guys think anybody else have a comment

1195
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:32,680
about day behavior superstar don't me all right

1196
01:31:33,480 --> 01:31:38,080
okay we'll be getting in the cage match a little bit I guess I'll open up the

1197
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:41,320
skype line for a minute if anybody has a comment on that song

1198
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:48,320
in other DDR news I may cut you off if we get a call Loki but I know you had

1199
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:49,440
some sim news you want to share

1200
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:52,560
I know something with food mix happened like there was some kind of like hidden

1201
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:54,560
song or something going on what's up

1202
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:58,600
was that last week? I thought that was this week? Did you mention it last week?

1203
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:04,280
Oh my bad, oh cause it came up last Sunday. Well hell. And if people read our website regularly they would have also seen it there too.

1204
01:32:04,280 --> 01:32:07,960
I read it regularly but I just forgot it was a week ago

1205
01:32:07,960 --> 01:32:10,460
Alright, so, fine.

1206
01:32:10,460 --> 01:32:12,460
I wasn't really talking about you, Rob.

1207
01:32:12,460 --> 01:32:14,960
Pfft! Pfft!

1208
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:19,960
Alright, Loki, while we're waiting to get a call on the Skyblind, what else is going on?

1209
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:24,960
I know there's some stuff going on in the Sim World this week. Tell us one thing. Something about StepMania.

1210
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:31,960
It's Alpha 23 time! And guess what, it's buggy as hell! And guess what, I don't care.

1211
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:40,960
Yeah, I guess they did stuff, they fixed stuff, added stuff. No one really cares other than the fact that it's Buggy. That's what I read. Buggy.

1212
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:52,960
But, um, other than that, not much else going on as far as sim stuff goes. I know there's that, um, OSC 3 or something like that that's going on right now. OSC 2, I think it's 3.

1213
01:32:52,960 --> 01:33:01,960
And, um, that's in, like, uh, round two or three right now of sets of stuff that they have. You can check out BomaniStyle, it's on their front page.

1214
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:13,960
And, um, other than that, really not too much else going on. There's a couple remix contests going on, one on BomaniStyle and the other one on DDR, uh, Maniacs. Both, uh, very similar in content.

1215
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:24,960
But my celly knows some of the artists have been putting their tracks up for people to listen to, but the judging and the actual stuff is going to be coming up pretty soon, I think.

1216
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:33,960
This must be this week, but I think it's probably next week. So I'll be looking for those and maybe we can play some of those a little later. I know you'll at least hear one of them later.

1217
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:38,960
Other than that, yeah, that's pretty much all that's been going on.

1218
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:47,680
Alright. Fair enough. Boy, it's been kind of a slow news week in the DDR world. Do you

1219
01:33:47,680 --> 01:33:52,640
think that's because of the upcoming DDR releases? I would think we'd be getting a lot more information

1220
01:33:52,640 --> 01:33:58,520
about Xtreme right now. Nobody's listening to me in the room, so whatever.

1221
01:33:58,520 --> 01:34:04,160
We are busy being cute and photogenic. What exactly are you doing?

1222
01:34:04,160 --> 01:34:06,560
We're taking self-pictures.

1223
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:07,520
That's so girly.

1224
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:15,080
God, there's a slumber party going on in the house now.

1225
01:34:15,080 --> 01:34:17,480
I want to die.

1226
01:34:17,480 --> 01:34:22,440
You know, can we help it that we have more estrogen than you?

1227
01:34:22,440 --> 01:34:24,080
Good, I cut myself out of the picture.

1228
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:26,160
I think it's a good time to have ourselves a cage match.

1229
01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:27,080
What do you guys think?

1230
01:34:27,080 --> 01:34:28,080
Good idea, Rob.

1231
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:31,080
Alright, let's get into the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.

1232
01:34:35,080 --> 01:34:44,080
Last week in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, Echo Image was entered, and because you know they have that song, Skulk, that's going to be in DDR.

1233
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:49,080
Well, if you pick up their CD, which by the way is an awesome, awesome CD, I highly recommend it.

1234
01:34:49,080 --> 01:34:53,080
CompuPhonic, I believe is the name of the CD. Check out echoimage.com for more info.

1235
01:34:53,080 --> 01:34:57,120
We played a track from that CD which won our cage match last week, it was my pick, and

1236
01:34:57,120 --> 01:34:58,760
the song was Standing Alone.

1237
01:34:58,760 --> 01:35:02,600
So you get to hear a clip of it because it won last week's cage match.

1238
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:05,840
So remember the way the cage match works, you hear a clip of last week's winner and

1239
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:08,160
then you hear two new songs in their entirety.

1240
01:35:08,160 --> 01:35:13,520
You pick your favorite and the best goes into rotation all week long here on Orange Lounge

1241
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:14,520
Radio.

1242
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:15,520
So you ready to kick it off?

1243
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:16,520
Show up.

1244
01:35:16,520 --> 01:35:18,760
You have to be in our chat room, don't participate.

1245
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:24,260
Here it goes, song number one, tonight's cage match is last week's winner, Standing Alone

1246
01:35:24,260 --> 01:35:25,440
by Echo Image.

1247
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:26,440
Here is a clip.

1248
01:35:26,440 --> 01:35:34,440
See them standing with new faces, the faces we know why

1249
01:35:34,440 --> 01:35:41,440
Standing there alone again, did I meet another friend

1250
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:48,440
Watching down the road of fame, could well never be the same

1251
01:35:48,440 --> 01:35:55,440
Standing there alone again, did I meet another friend

1252
01:35:55,440 --> 01:35:58,920
We're walking down the road of pain

1253
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:02,760
The truth will never be the same

1254
01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:06,080
Give way for another truthless day

1255
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:09,920
Your eyes end up sitting on your toes

1256
01:36:09,920 --> 01:36:13,080
You hold your breath while feeling numb

1257
01:36:13,080 --> 01:36:16,760
Black rain clouds filling up the sun

1258
01:36:16,760 --> 01:36:21,160
The shouting voices in your head

1259
01:36:21,160 --> 01:36:23,600
Tell you nothing

1260
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:27,600
You screamed but no one heard you calling

1261
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:31,600
You left with all your lies

1262
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:37,600
Lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies

1263
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:44,600
Lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies

1264
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:48,600
Standing there alone again

1265
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:51,600
You'd have made another friend

1266
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:55,100
And I'm walking down the road of pain

1267
01:36:55,100 --> 01:36:59,100
Who will never be the same?

1268
01:37:06,100 --> 01:37:09,100
Who will never be the same?

1269
01:37:09,100 --> 01:37:29,100
Alright, that was song number one in tonight's cage match, Echo Image with Standing Alone.

1270
01:37:29,100 --> 01:37:30,100
You know.

1271
01:37:30,100 --> 01:37:31,100
Can't get enough of that CD this week.

1272
01:37:31,100 --> 01:37:33,140
I swear that group sounds like Depeche Mode.

1273
01:37:33,140 --> 01:37:34,140
They're just the bomb.

1274
01:37:34,140 --> 01:37:35,140
They're pretty cool.

1275
01:37:35,140 --> 01:37:36,340
I love that CD.

1276
01:37:36,340 --> 01:37:37,600
Love it.

1277
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:42,540
9 is my favorite but it's not good for cage matches so I'd like to mention now

1278
01:37:42,540 --> 01:37:46,060

1285
01:38:14,780 --> 01:38:17,980
song number two which comes to us tonight courtesy of the lovely dark

1286
01:38:17,980 --> 01:38:22,060
Sakura and I see I see it's a little bit of a different sound yeah I just had to

1287
01:38:22,060 --> 01:38:24,220
give her something different but actually it's more just because it's

1288
01:38:24,220 --> 01:38:28,300
sort of been sitting on my head for a while we I'll give a little bit of back

1289
01:38:28,300 --> 01:38:32,140
story to this you know Dan's have been really big with his main cabinet the

1290
01:38:32,140 --> 01:38:36,380
multi-arcade machine emulator and he got another emulator called Daphne that plays the old

1291
01:38:36,380 --> 01:38:42,560
laserdisc games like Dragon's Lair and Space Ace. He got Cliffjumper to work. Now if anyone

1292
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:49,000
remembers the game Cliffjumper, it was basically using scenes from Lupin the Third Castle Cagliostro.

1293
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:54,200
So in honor of that, I decided to pick the Tokyo-Suka Orchestra with the theme of Lupin

1294
01:38:54,200 --> 01:38:58,840
the Third. This should be great. So DDR folks know this one because Lupin the Third obviously

1295
01:38:58,840 --> 01:39:04,840
And most DDR and anime tend to have that hand-in-hand thing going on.

1296
01:39:04,840 --> 01:39:05,840
This is classic.

1297
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:11,380
All right, here we go Tokyo Paradise ska orchestra with theme from loop in the third enjoy

1298
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:37,840
One, two, three, four!

1299
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:18,200
Alright though, song number two in tonight's cage match, the Tokyo Paradise Ska Orchestra,

1300
01:42:18,200 --> 01:42:20,120
with a theme from Lupin the Third.

1301
01:42:20,120 --> 01:42:23,520
Let's see what the general theme is in this room about that song.

1302
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:24,520
Dark Sakura.

1303
01:42:24,520 --> 01:42:25,520
Ten.

1304
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:26,520
Ten.

1305
01:42:26,520 --> 01:42:29,880
It's just because I, when I first downloaded that song like a long time ago, I downloaded

1306
01:42:29,880 --> 01:42:35,600
a bunch of Lupin the Third mixes, and that one I had on repeat for like ever, just because

1307
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:47,200
it was so energetic all right uh dark child what'd you think uh give it uh i'd say maybe a six and a

1308
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:53,600
half well listen to it all i could think of was like late 70s early 80s people just cruising down

1309
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:59,600
a beach in some kind of movie which i guess fits lupin but yeah i give it about 6.5 just really

1310
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:05,360
is in my style all right not a ska fam that's all right all right ddr colic um i'm not big on ska

1311
01:43:05,360 --> 01:43:11,120
either but i liked it a lot i i i'd give it like a nine because it was very fun very well put

1312
01:43:11,120 --> 01:43:21,920
together i think and it totally reminded me of hawaii five oh okay i'm done angel ten really

1313
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:28,880
well i was gonna say because uh i like lupin a lot and uh that uh ska rendition was pretty good

1314
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:33,880
And plus Alex got two, so it kind of had a double...

1315
01:43:33,880 --> 01:43:34,880
Jesus, stop it!

1316
01:43:34,880 --> 01:43:36,880
All the good stuff, all the good stuff for you.

1317
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:38,880
All right, a 10 from Angel.

1318
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:40,880
Loki.

1319
01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:41,880
It was okay.

1320
01:43:41,880 --> 01:43:44,880
I mean, they just loop in.

1321
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:47,880
So I give it a six.

1322
01:43:47,880 --> 01:43:49,880
Me personally, I actually liked it a lot.

1323
01:43:49,880 --> 01:43:50,880
It was kind of just jazzy.

1324
01:43:50,880 --> 01:43:51,880
It made me want to get up and dance.

1325
01:43:51,880 --> 01:43:55,880
I wouldn't be surprised if something like that showed up in like UltraMix with the randomness

1326
01:43:55,880 --> 01:43:59,640
that that game is getting in a different genre.

1327
01:43:59,640 --> 01:44:02,800
Yeah, it'll be fun! I'd give it like an eight and a half. A lot of fun.

1328
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:06,240
Correct. Jason gives it a six and a half and a hump of cinnamon roll.

1329
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:10,640
Alright, moving on. Let's go on to Loki's

1330
01:44:10,640 --> 01:44:15,040
pick and let's see what he's picked for us. Ooh, I see it's a Ditter song.

1331
01:44:15,040 --> 01:44:16,800
A what?

1332
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:19,080
DDR. Ditter. Get it?

1333
01:44:19,080 --> 01:44:22,480
I'm sorry, I'm not hip to your crap.

1334
01:44:22,480 --> 01:44:23,580
uh...

1335
01:44:23,580 --> 01:44:26,140
now this is this is not that uh...

1336
01:44:26,140 --> 01:44:30,800
that the amateur did he was he made the thought for uh... the from myself

1337
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:32,020
remixed content

1338
01:44:32,020 --> 01:44:35,680
one of them being a remix of kong kong and the other one being a remix of you

1339
01:44:35,680 --> 01:44:37,040
know max

1340
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:41,520
so this one's kind of interesting it's like a rave version of max but like you

1341
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:42,960
know

1342
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:44,520
not like

1343
01:44:44,520 --> 01:44:45,880
you'll gain rate

1344
01:44:45,880 --> 01:44:49,960
but you can't do it but but but i don't

1345
01:44:49,960 --> 01:44:58,120
Like, fucking hardcore rave shit. Not this, like, crappy, like, you know, stupid, uh, you know, Star Minecraft.

1346
01:44:58,120 --> 01:45:00,520
This is, like, fucking hardcore shit. None of this...

1347
01:45:01,720 --> 01:45:06,520
Anyway, let's play this song. This is, uh, Max Attack by D.M. Ashura.

1348
01:45:08,760 --> 01:45:13,320
Alright, I'm gonna queue it up here, and you guys can, uh, take a look at this and see if you wanna vote for it.

1349
01:45:13,480 --> 01:45:18,040
It's a rave version of a popular DDR song. Here it is.

1350
01:45:18,040 --> 01:45:21,040
It's DM Ashura with Max Attack.

1351
01:45:26,040 --> 01:45:28,040
Just kidding, just kidding, I couldn't resist.

1352
01:45:28,040 --> 01:45:30,040
I need a hug.

1353
01:45:32,040 --> 01:45:33,040
Whatever.

1354
01:45:33,040 --> 01:45:40,040
Alright, no, all kidding aside, all kidding aside, here it is, DM Ashura with Max Attack.

1355
01:49:33,040 --> 01:49:38,540
All right, we are back and let's see what everybody thought of Max Attack.

1356
01:49:41,540 --> 01:49:47,040
I like that last part that was different from everything else, but I don't like Max.

1357
01:49:49,040 --> 01:49:51,540
And I don't like, usually don't like the mixes of Max.

1358
01:49:53,040 --> 01:49:56,540
That one was okay, and it sort of reminded me of that scene from Blade.

1359
01:49:56,540 --> 01:50:13,540
But, it's still max. I mean, it wasn't bad. It was not bad. It's even better than max 300. Or max any of the other million versions of VR max there are.

1360
01:50:13,540 --> 01:50:21,540
So, since I would normally give Mack the four, I'm going to give that a six and a half.

1361
01:50:21,540 --> 01:50:22,540
All right.

1362
01:50:22,540 --> 01:50:23,540
Just above average.

1363
01:50:23,540 --> 01:50:25,540
Six and a half from Jamie.

1364
01:50:25,540 --> 01:50:27,540
Dark Childs.

1365
01:50:27,540 --> 01:50:34,540
Once again, Loki manages to pick the song that I tend to like, so I'm going to give it a ten.

1366
01:50:34,540 --> 01:50:40,540
While thinking of it and listening to it, I could totally picture my homeboy Enrique doing a light show with his orbiter

1367
01:50:40,540 --> 01:50:45,740
as all my friends fizz out and get crazy. So 10.

1368
01:50:45,740 --> 01:50:47,580
All right, D.R. Golic.

1369
01:50:47,580 --> 01:50:55,740
Um, I'm kind of with Jamie on the Max issue. Max is kind of like a noise song for me.

1370
01:50:55,740 --> 01:51:01,500
It's not bad, but it's more noisy. But I like the way they mixed this towards the end especially.

1371
01:51:02,860 --> 01:51:08,300
It had a lot of energy behind it. It kind of made me tired just listening to it.

1372
01:51:08,300 --> 01:51:11,540
but I think I would give it like, let's say a 7.

1373
01:51:11,540 --> 01:51:15,000
It's not too bad. It's pretty good. I'd like...

1374
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:18,780
I would listen to it. I like it. Alright, Angel.

1375
01:51:18,780 --> 01:51:21,900
Alright, I'm gonna give it a 10, and I'm gonna tell you why I'm gonna give it a 10. Why's that?

1376
01:51:21,900 --> 01:51:25,340
Because I respect DM Ashura just as much

1377
01:51:25,340 --> 01:51:28,740
as I respect R.Loki over here. Because, I'll tell you what,

1378
01:51:28,740 --> 01:51:32,220
I've heard a lot of remixes, and

1379
01:51:32,220 --> 01:51:35,940
out of a lot of them, I mean, DM Ashura and Loki, they just...

1380
01:51:35,940 --> 01:51:42,940
I don't know. They just have a talent. They both have very extreme talent, and I, you know, I really respect that, so that's why I'm giving it a 10.

1381
01:51:42,940 --> 01:51:44,940
Logan!

1382
01:51:44,940 --> 01:51:51,940
His stuff just keeps getting better. I mean, I honestly, I hated Max Resurrection when he first made it. I thought it was like, eh, it was okay.

1383
01:51:51,940 --> 01:51:58,940
I mean, at least it's better than anything that, uh, you know, what Bomani Ruler did. Man, I totally forgot about Bomani Ruler.

1384
01:51:58,940 --> 01:52:12,940
But anyways, he just keeps getting better at his stuff, and I like how he's gone away from more of the midi stuff, and actually starting to use more of the tools at hand.

1385
01:52:12,940 --> 01:52:16,940
So yeah, I'd give it a 10, because it's really good.

1386
01:52:16,940 --> 01:52:25,940
And I really wanted to play the Clone Clone 1, but I'll just save that for another week, because when we start talking about the remix competition, because it was really good.

1387
01:52:25,940 --> 01:52:30,740
It's a really good remix of it. Back since no one's done a remix of that, you know, it's really good.

1388
01:52:30,740 --> 01:52:38,740
But, um, there's a lot of good stuff. If you really want to check out some of these remixes that are, um, coming out for, um, this new remix competition,

1389
01:52:38,740 --> 01:52:48,740
just go to PomaniCell.com in their forums, under Music Production. There's a whole thread on the remix contest, and there's a bunch of links on, like, page 2 where people are linking to their songs.

1390
01:52:48,740 --> 01:52:50,640
So go check it out there.

1391
01:52:50,640 --> 01:52:52,140
Did you enter that contest?

1392
01:52:52,140 --> 01:52:53,240
No, we did not.

1393
01:52:53,240 --> 01:52:54,240
Alright, that's good.

1394
01:52:54,240 --> 01:53:00,000
I thought that was an excellent remix. It's very well done.

1395
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:03,040
D.M. Ashura is very talented. He's one of the best

1396
01:53:03,040 --> 01:53:07,400
Bimani remixers out there today, and the remix was incredibly well done.

1397
01:53:07,400 --> 01:53:10,600
That being said, I give it a four. Because...

1398
01:53:10,600 --> 01:53:13,760
What's wrong with that? Because I am absolutely

1399
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:19,240
sick and fucking tired of Max. I am... I'm sorry, but that song did nothing for me.

1400
01:53:19,240 --> 01:53:20,240
I sat there going,

1401
01:53:20,240 --> 01:53:24,240
God, this is good. It's so well done. I'm like, this should hella be in DDR, but then I'm like,

1402
01:53:24,240 --> 01:53:28,240
but I'm fucking sick of this song. I'm so fucking sick of this song.

1403
01:53:28,240 --> 01:53:32,240
Sorry. That's just how I feel.

1404
01:53:32,240 --> 01:53:36,240
So, there you have it. But anyway, it doesn't matter what I

1405
01:53:36,240 --> 01:53:40,240
think or what anybody here thinks. It's really up to you guys out there in our chat room to place

Song number one was Echo Image with Standing Alone.

1408
01:53:59,380 --> 01:54:04,040
Song number two tonight was Tokyo Paradise Ska Orchestra with a theme from Lubin the

1409
01:54:04,040 --> 01:54:11,040
a third.

1410
01:54:16,800 --> 01:54:23,800
Alright, in song number three tonight, DM Ashura with Max Attack.

1415
01:54:51,520 --> 01:55:03,860
I mentioned earlier in my live journal that I was going to be finishing one of my songs.

1416
01:55:03,860 --> 01:55:07,700
Now I have not finished the song yet, but I was going to let you guys know what I was

1417
01:55:07,700 --> 01:55:08,700
planning to do.

1418
01:55:08,700 --> 01:55:16,580
One of the best remixes that I think I've done has been the Ecstasy 14 Hours mix.

1419
01:55:16,580 --> 01:55:20,400
But I was thinking to myself, what could make it better?

1420
01:55:20,400 --> 01:55:21,700
What could make it better?

1421
01:55:21,700 --> 01:55:22,700
Well...

1422
01:55:22,700 --> 01:55:23,760
Tell us, Loki.

1423
01:55:23,760 --> 01:55:29,380
It just so happens that in my family, there is a certain person who has vocal talent.

1424
01:55:29,380 --> 01:55:31,460
Obviously it's not me.

1425
01:55:31,460 --> 01:55:35,420
It would be my sister, Gypsy Wolf, who was on the show last week.

1426
01:55:35,420 --> 01:55:39,460
She's going to be, as soon as I figure out what I'm going to do and write the lyrics,

1427
01:55:39,460 --> 01:55:41,820
she's going to be laying down a vocal track for that song.

1428
01:55:41,820 --> 01:55:42,820
Sweet.

1429
01:55:42,820 --> 01:55:45,220
A completely original vocal track to go with it.

1430
01:55:45,220 --> 01:55:46,220
That's awesome.

1431
01:55:46,220 --> 01:55:50,220
Wow, I didn't know your sister could sing. That's cool.

1432
01:55:50,220 --> 01:55:59,220
So that's my plan. And then I'm going to also finish it off, make it the full length, and we'll do that. So that should be awesome.

1433
01:55:59,220 --> 01:56:02,220
What kind of lyrics?

1434
01:56:02,220 --> 01:56:07,220
I don't know. I haven't really thought about that yet. That's the problem. I've got to figure that out.

1435
01:56:07,220 --> 01:56:13,220
We've set the date to when we're going to record, not this coming up Wednesday, but a week from Wednesday.

1436
01:56:13,220 --> 01:56:21,220
I have about 10 days or so to figure out something. I should have enough time.

1437
01:56:21,220 --> 01:56:24,220
Have you done voices before? Voice vocals?

1438
01:56:24,220 --> 01:56:29,220
No, I haven't. It's just an experiment to see if it'll work. I think it should be fine.

1439
01:56:29,220 --> 01:56:35,220
We have a pretty quiet apartment here. It shouldn't be that much background stuff.

1440
01:56:35,220 --> 01:56:42,220
Really, the song has a very simple, you know, beat to it, you know, so just figure out something.

1441
01:56:42,220 --> 01:56:44,220
I just have to figure out cool lyrics for it.

1442
01:56:44,220 --> 01:56:45,220
That's about it.

1443
01:56:45,220 --> 01:56:46,220
That's cool.

1444
01:56:46,220 --> 01:56:47,220
That's awesome.

1445
01:56:47,220 --> 01:56:50,220
Good for you.

1446
01:56:50,220 --> 01:56:54,220
Alright, last call for cage match votes in our chat room, by the way.

1447
01:56:54,220 --> 01:56:55,220
Here's your last chance to submit a cage match.

1448
01:56:55,220 --> 01:56:58,220
We're doing a very, very close race right now between all three songs.

1449
01:56:58,220 --> 01:56:59,220
Very close.

1450
01:56:59,220 --> 01:57:02,220
While they're voting, we do have an opportunity to put in some plugs there.

1451
01:57:02,220 --> 01:57:03,220
Ah, yes.

1452
01:57:03,220 --> 01:57:04,220
Go and do some plugs.

1453
01:57:04,220 --> 01:57:08,220
Well, we have the one on Monday, right?

1454
01:57:08,220 --> 01:57:14,220
Absolutely. Monday Nights is Diversion on Orange Lawn's radio, our Bamani remix show.

1455
01:57:14,220 --> 01:57:18,220
And it runs between 7 o'clock and 9 o'clock, and of course you're gonna hear stuff like

1456
01:57:18,220 --> 01:57:23,220
Even Though I'm Sick of Max, I think that song definitely deserves to be in rotation on that show.

1457
01:57:23,220 --> 01:57:26,220
Max Attack, along with some of the other recent remixes.

1458
01:57:26,220 --> 01:57:30,220
In fact, this week we're gonna feature a lot of the newer recent remixes from that thread.

1459
01:57:30,220 --> 01:57:31,220
So, some of the good stuff.

1460
01:57:31,220 --> 01:57:36,220
So we'll add that in for you guys, and that's going to be this Monday night, and every Monday night, the Monty remixes.

1461
01:57:36,220 --> 01:57:41,220
It's an awesome show. Seriously, if you like DDR, if you like 2DX, you're missing out if you're not listening to this show.

1462
01:57:41,220 --> 01:57:47,220
There's some good, good stuff on it. I think it's the little gem of our station, honestly.

1463
01:57:47,220 --> 01:57:52,220
Tuesday is my baby. My retarded, backwards, beaten baby.

1464
01:57:52,220 --> 01:57:53,220
Two-headed from Silent Hill 4.

1465
01:57:53,220 --> 01:57:56,220
My two-headed baby from Silent Hill 4.

1466
01:57:56,220 --> 01:57:58,120
It's pump up the volume

1467
01:57:58,120 --> 01:58:02,760
Named after a really awesome movie from the 80s because I had Christian Slater in it and he was hot

1468
01:58:02,840 --> 01:58:07,040
With his little whole Jack Nicholson thing going on. Anyway back to my show

1469
01:58:07,920 --> 01:58:11,200
I starts off. It's supposed to start off at 7 with a pre-show

1470
01:58:12,120 --> 01:58:15,740
Depends on how my homework goes because I have a dentist appointment this week. Oh joy joy

1471
01:58:16,680 --> 01:58:21,300
But assuming all goes well and on time. I will be starting the pre-show at 7

1472
01:58:21,300 --> 01:58:24,840
maybe a quarter till and then the show starts at 730 and

1473
01:58:24,840 --> 01:58:29,300
And basically I go until about 10 30 or so. This is Pacific time, by the way

1474
01:58:30,200 --> 01:58:35,280
And sometimes I go later, but I just play you know, if you're in our chat room, I'll play whatever you request

1475
01:58:35,280 --> 01:58:40,440
But lately I've been doing marathons of stuff this past week. I did a strong bad sings

1476
01:58:41,160 --> 01:58:43,160
oh god, um and

1477
01:58:43,880 --> 01:58:45,000
I

1478
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:49,040
Did something else and I really don't remember what the hell it was. Oh, yeah

1479
01:58:49,040 --> 01:58:51,880
I did a bunch of Richard G's lounge against the machine

1480
01:58:51,880 --> 01:58:56,880
Like you might have heard for our fortune cookie last week.

1481
01:58:56,880 --> 01:58:58,880
So we had a bunch of lounge against the machine.

1482
01:58:58,880 --> 01:59:02,880
And then afterwards I just got really bored and decided to play the entirety of Dressed to Kill.

1483
01:59:02,880 --> 01:59:04,880
The ideas are just so awesome.

1484
01:59:07,880 --> 01:59:10,880
So I'm probably going to be doing another comedy week soon.

1485
01:59:10,880 --> 01:59:16,880
But I'm thinking that this Tuesday I'm going to probably play some Desrow.

1486
01:59:16,880 --> 01:59:26,880
Oh, we've got requests to play Strong Bad Sings. Well, maybe I'll sneak in a few of the tracks off of Strong Bad Sings again.

1487
01:59:26,880 --> 01:59:30,880
But I think that I'm just going to go completely random and just play whatever.

1488
01:59:30,880 --> 01:59:41,880
So, you never know what you'll hear. I'm going to toss in some overclock remixes, toss in some stuff from Amplitude, I think, and play whatever.

1489
01:59:41,880 --> 01:59:48,880
Alright, good stuff on Pump Up The Volume. Why aren't you listening, if you haven't yet?

1490
01:59:48,880 --> 01:59:50,880
You're going to have to listen if you want to win that tier thing.

1491
01:59:50,880 --> 01:59:52,880
What the hell is up with Pump Up The Vicodin?

1492
01:59:52,880 --> 01:59:53,880
I like that.

1493
01:59:53,880 --> 01:59:55,880
I am not on Vicodin!

1494
01:59:55,880 --> 02:00:00,880
Wednesday night, brand new show, Outside The Box, is actually going to be on break for the next two weeks.

1495
02:00:00,880 --> 02:00:05,880
Because I'm gone, so you're going to get some Vanilla Sky Retro for the next two weeks.

1496
02:00:05,880 --> 02:00:11,180
two weeks, Vanilla Sky Retro, some of our old ass shit for the next couple weeks. Old

1497
02:00:11,180 --> 02:00:15,360
ass shit. And actually, actually we will do, we're gonna do some old ass shit next week

1498
02:00:15,360 --> 02:00:19,440
and then in a couple weeks you'll hear the outside the box preview show because a lot

1499
02:00:19,440 --> 02:00:22,800
of you guys missed that, so we're gonna replay that preview show because we didn't announce

1500
02:00:22,800 --> 02:00:26,980
it. So, we'll give you guys a second chance to hear it. So, at least you guys have something

1501
02:00:26,980 --> 02:00:31,120
new to look forward to. So, look forward to a Vanilla Sky Retro bit and outside the box.

1502
02:00:31,120 --> 02:00:33,720
and then when I get back, all new episodes!

1503
02:00:33,720 --> 02:00:35,720
Yay! For months and months and months.

1504
02:00:35,720 --> 02:00:42,120
Alright. You certainly should do a video game music trivia again, DarkSagra.

1505
02:00:42,120 --> 02:00:43,920
What did you just say?

1506
02:00:43,920 --> 02:00:47,520
You should do a video game music trivia again, DarkSagra.

1507
02:00:47,520 --> 02:00:50,520
Well, I'm thinking about changing my format on that one because it's really...

1508
02:00:50,520 --> 02:00:54,920
I can't get as much in, waiting on people to send in votes and everything,

1509
02:00:54,920 --> 02:00:57,920
but what I might do is I might do it in an email format.

1510
02:00:57,920 --> 02:01:09,920
I'm going to be setting up an email just for video game music trivia for our various trivia things as well as our contests. Maybe I should do that.

1511
02:01:09,920 --> 02:01:14,920
Alright. Let's see. Darktowel, do you have something you want to say?

1512
02:01:14,920 --> 02:01:16,920
Yes, before the votes are tallied.

1513
02:01:16,920 --> 02:01:17,920
Yes.

1514
02:01:17,920 --> 02:01:21,920
Slash MSG space sky space vote three. Enter.

1515
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:25,920
Actually, the voting's closed because I'm just about to announce the winner.

1516
02:01:25,920 --> 02:01:26,920
So...

1517
02:01:26,920 --> 02:01:27,920
Meet your Rob.

1518
02:01:27,920 --> 02:01:28,920
All right.

1519
02:01:28,920 --> 02:01:29,920
What do you guys think?

1520
02:01:29,920 --> 02:01:30,920
What do you guys think won tonight?

1521
02:01:30,920 --> 02:01:32,240
What do you guys think won tonight?

1522
02:01:32,240 --> 02:01:33,240
Holik.

1523
02:01:33,240 --> 02:01:34,240
Holik.

1524
02:01:34,240 --> 02:01:35,240
Hahaha.

1525
02:01:35,240 --> 02:01:36,240
Loki says Echo Image won again.

1526
02:01:36,240 --> 02:01:37,240
What do you think, Jamie?

1527
02:01:37,240 --> 02:01:38,240
Holik.

1528
02:01:38,240 --> 02:01:39,240
Holik.

1529
02:01:39,240 --> 02:01:40,240
What do you think, Angel?

1530
02:01:40,240 --> 02:01:41,240
Umm...

1531
02:01:41,240 --> 02:01:42,240
That's really hard.

1532
02:01:42,240 --> 02:01:43,240
I...

1533
02:01:43,240 --> 02:01:44,240
Let me think about that for a second.

1534
02:01:44,240 --> 02:01:45,240
Let me think about that for a second.

1535
02:01:45,240 --> 02:01:46,240
Okay.

1536
02:01:46,240 --> 02:01:47,240
Here it is.

1537
02:01:47,240 --> 02:01:48,240
Tonight's winner.

1538
02:01:48,240 --> 02:01:49,720
And I gotta say, tonight's winner actually kind of surprised me.

1539
02:01:49,720 --> 02:01:52,840
I wasn't expecting this one to win, but it won by one vote.

1540
02:01:52,840 --> 02:01:54,360
Oh my god!

1541
02:01:54,360 --> 02:01:56,360
Yet again won by one vote

1542
02:01:58,560 --> 02:02:00,560
Tokyo skull

1543
02:02:00,600 --> 02:02:07,760
With loop in the third. I actually I thought our chat room was gonna go for the other stuff. I was kind of surprised

1544
02:02:08,280 --> 02:02:14,080
One vote over echo image and one vote. Oh, or I'm sorry two votes over DMS

1545
02:02:14,080 --> 02:02:18,000
sure, it was a very very close cage match tonight Wow and I

1546
02:02:18,720 --> 02:02:20,720
Was I'm actually surprised Jamie

1547
02:02:20,720 --> 02:02:29,360
I mean, I don't want to dog your pick or anything, but I usually, the pattern of the chatroom is, they go towards the techno stuff, and the Bomani remixes always win.

1548
02:02:29,360 --> 02:02:32,800
I think that is the first time a Bomani remix is not won, so.

1549
02:02:32,800 --> 02:02:36,160
But you can consider Lupin III a remix, I don't know.

1550
02:02:36,160 --> 02:02:44,160
Oh yeah, it did have two, actually, it was in, mainly a three, and as well as being in DDR.

1551
02:02:44,160 --> 02:02:46,560
And of course our chatroom's up in arms.

1552
02:02:46,560 --> 02:02:48,320
Hey, you voted!

1553
02:02:48,320 --> 02:02:49,760
That's right, you guys voted.

1554
02:02:49,760 --> 02:02:55,040
You voted. That's right. You need to exercise your right to vote as you should this November as well.

1555
02:02:55,820 --> 02:02:59,500
Rob. What? You forgot one. What? What's after Wednesday?

1556
02:03:00,240 --> 02:03:05,980
Thursday, the Orange House Radio Rewind. Thank you. And it's a week behind guys. Sorry, but next week

1557
02:03:05,980 --> 02:03:10,180
you're actually gonna hear the last week's show with Float Walk, which was a really good show though.

1558
02:03:10,180 --> 02:03:12,120
So listen. Of course it was. And then in two weeks you'll hear.

1559
02:03:12,120 --> 02:03:17,020
But that's actually a good thing that it's off by a week because it gives me a chance to put in next week's show

1560
02:03:17,020 --> 02:03:28,060
go after I'm gone. Maybe we did it that way on purpose. Alright. I'm, wow. I'm still surprised.

1561
02:03:28,060 --> 02:03:31,580
That's like the most surprising cage match win I think I've had. Nothing but surprises

1562
02:03:31,580 --> 02:03:35,940
here. We have a request in the chat. That means you whores are getting Britney next

1563
02:03:35,940 --> 02:03:42,940
week from me. I mean um. Actually I have a great, I think next week I'm gonna go to my

1564
02:03:42,940 --> 02:03:44,940
Sesame Street Sings album.

1565
02:03:44,940 --> 02:03:46,940
Cool!

1566
02:03:46,940 --> 02:03:50,940
Or what I'll do is I'll take a drum loop in the background. It'll be a remix.

1567
02:03:50,940 --> 02:03:54,940
Okay, Rob. We need like some Burt songs being all evil.

1568
02:03:54,940 --> 02:03:57,940
Alright.

1569
02:03:57,940 --> 02:04:00,940
Is that site still up? Birdisevil.com?

1570
02:04:00,940 --> 02:04:03,940
Yes. I know there's Birdisevil sites.

1571
02:04:03,940 --> 02:04:06,940
Skype line's open if you guys have any comments.

1572
02:04:06,940 --> 02:04:10,940
I want to hear that clip of the Sesame Street characters all high.

02:04:10,940 --> 02:04:14,380

when I leave for a week, but we'll see. Anyway, Skyblind's ringing and hello, you're on Orange

1581
02:04:42,020 --> 02:04:52,020
Lawn's radio. Okay. First up. Yes. Who's this? It's Misty. Hi Misty, how are you? Hi Misty.

1582
02:04:52,020 --> 02:04:58,300
We like Misty because she helps archive cam pics for us. She's cool. How you doin'? Well,

1583
02:04:58,300 --> 02:05:03,180
as you can tell, I finally got my mic. Hey, good times. Alright. Well, what's on your

1584
02:05:03,180 --> 02:05:09,180
Well, cage mash, I say we got screwed over.

1585
02:05:09,180 --> 02:05:11,180
Don't blame us!

1586
02:05:11,180 --> 02:05:14,180
Do you want to tell what you voted for, Misty?

1587
02:05:14,180 --> 02:05:18,180
If Secret wants to, he can.

1588
02:05:18,180 --> 02:05:21,180
Oh, well that gives it away right there.

1589
02:05:21,180 --> 02:05:23,180
Misty voted for Echo Image, obviously.

1590
02:05:23,180 --> 02:05:27,180
I know it's a tough blow to all the Echo Image fans, but you know what?

1591
02:05:27,180 --> 02:05:30,180
I promise I will bring Echo Image back to the table in a later week.

1592
02:05:30,180 --> 02:05:32,180
Sounds good.

1593
02:05:32,180 --> 02:05:36,180
I guess we'll let Jamie have her moment with her little ska thing.

1594
02:05:36,180 --> 02:05:39,180
My little ska thing, you said you liked it.

1595
02:05:39,180 --> 02:05:41,180
I have to give her a hard time, I have to give her a hard time, totally.

1596
02:05:41,180 --> 02:05:42,180
That's a good ska song.

1597
02:05:42,180 --> 02:05:45,180
Anything else on your mind, Missy?

1598
02:05:45,180 --> 02:05:51,180
I just wanted to say happy birthday to Loki again, even though I said it's him in the live journal.

1599
02:05:51,180 --> 02:05:54,180
Personal happy birthdays are always good.

1600
02:05:54,180 --> 02:05:55,180
Thank you.

1601
02:05:55,180 --> 02:06:01,180
Wasn't that a great present that DD Archaholic got him?

1602
02:06:01,180 --> 02:06:04,340
Yeah, giggling is about all I can say about it too.

1603
02:06:04,340 --> 02:06:09,060
I forgot the message. Now if I could show up for my birthday, would I get Jack?

1604
02:06:09,060 --> 02:06:13,340
Huh? We'll see. Would she get Jack Daniels if she could

1605
02:06:13,340 --> 02:06:18,340
make it out here? Sure, why not?

1606
02:06:18,340 --> 02:06:20,980
Alright, we're going to let you go, Misty, so we can take another call.

1607
02:06:20,980 --> 02:06:24,060
Alright. Have a good one. Thanks for calling. You too. Bye bye.

1608
02:06:24,060 --> 02:06:27,580
It's good to hear from new people. Let's hear from another new person. Hello, you are on.

1609
02:06:27,580 --> 02:06:31,140
Oh, did I miss it? Oh, the guy hung up.

1610
02:06:31,140 --> 02:06:34,140
I tried to pick up the phone from somebody new and they hung up.

1611
02:06:34,140 --> 02:06:35,140
Grrr.

1612
02:06:35,140 --> 02:06:36,140
I'll call back.

1613
02:06:36,140 --> 02:06:37,140
Oh, they're calling back.

1614
02:06:37,140 --> 02:06:38,140
Let's try this again.

1615
02:06:38,140 --> 02:06:39,140
Howdy, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1616
02:06:39,140 --> 02:06:41,140
Sorry about that, Skye.

1617
02:06:41,140 --> 02:06:42,140
Yeah, yeah, I know.

1618
02:06:42,140 --> 02:06:43,140
Who is this?

1619
02:06:43,140 --> 02:06:45,140
Uh, uh, S-Ghost.

1620
02:06:45,140 --> 02:06:47,140
Hi, S-Ghost, how are you?

1621
02:06:47,140 --> 02:06:48,140
I am doing very good.

1622
02:06:48,140 --> 02:06:49,140
How are you doing, Skye?

1623
02:06:49,140 --> 02:06:50,140
Good, I'm, I'm okay.

1624
02:06:50,140 --> 02:06:52,140
Life doesn't suck.

1625
02:06:52,140 --> 02:06:57,140
Alright, about the song, you know, yeah.

1626
02:06:57,140 --> 02:06:59,140
About the cage match?

1627
02:06:59,140 --> 02:07:05,140
About the cage match, I just got back when I heard you announcing all three songs there.

1628
02:07:05,140 --> 02:07:09,140
I think I'm personally responsible for Lupin winning.

1629
02:07:09,140 --> 02:07:11,140
Thank you!

1630
02:07:11,140 --> 02:07:13,140
Because you voted off that little clip there?

1631
02:07:13,140 --> 02:07:15,140
Exactly.

1632
02:07:15,140 --> 02:07:19,140
Looking back, I was watching various...

1633
02:07:19,140 --> 02:07:25,140
I feel sorry about talking about it, but I watched the new kids on the block, Bands Reunited.

1634
02:07:25,140 --> 02:07:27,140
Shut up!

1635
02:07:27,140 --> 02:07:30,840
But yeah, um, yeah.

1636
02:07:30,840 --> 02:07:35,440
Well, you know what, it's all your fault, but that's alright. We'll forgive you somehow.

1637
02:07:35,440 --> 02:07:37,740
How rules.

1638
02:07:37,740 --> 02:07:41,640
Friends is either ignorant or, you know, maybe they were just

1639
02:07:41,640 --> 02:07:43,140
taking some weird drugs that morning.

1640
02:07:43,140 --> 02:07:47,540
Seegert is yelling at you in our chat room right now as well. He's a little angry at you.

1641
02:07:47,540 --> 02:07:51,640
Seegert made my girlfriend hit me in the balls before the show.

1642
02:07:51,640 --> 02:07:54,940
How did that happen?

1643
02:07:54,940 --> 02:07:57,940
Wait, oh, you're cutting out, bud. How'd that happen?

1644
02:07:57,940 --> 02:08:02,940
Okay, basically, um, I have no idea where this came from.

1645
02:08:02,940 --> 02:08:06,940
But we got discussing, and he started talking about, like,

1646
02:08:06,940 --> 02:08:10,940
woman's place is in the kitchen, and then my girlfriend saw that,

1647
02:08:10,940 --> 02:08:14,940
and she's like, defend me, and I'm like, okay, don't hurt me.

1648
02:08:14,940 --> 02:08:21,940
It's okay, because he's a big gay, so it doesn't matter.

1649
02:08:21,940 --> 02:08:22,940
Alright.

1650
02:08:22,940 --> 02:08:23,940
Alright.

1651
02:08:23,940 --> 02:08:25,940
Have a good one, S-Ghost.

1652
02:08:25,940 --> 02:08:27,940
Anything else you want to share?

1653
02:08:27,940 --> 02:08:29,940
Um, I don't know.

1654
02:08:29,940 --> 02:08:34,940
I just wanted to say that, uh, yeah.

1655
02:08:34,940 --> 02:08:36,940
I'm happy looping one.

1656
02:08:36,940 --> 02:08:37,940
Alright.

1657
02:08:37,940 --> 02:08:38,940
Alright, well, I'm glad you're happy.

1658
02:08:38,940 --> 02:08:39,940
Thank you.

1659
02:08:39,940 --> 02:08:40,940
Have a good one.

1660
02:08:40,940 --> 02:08:41,940
You too.

1661
02:08:41,940 --> 02:08:42,940
Bye.

1662
02:08:42,940 --> 02:08:44,940
At least this program can make somebody happy.

1663
02:08:44,940 --> 02:08:48,940
You know, for the longest time, I thought his name was S-Goat, not S-Ghost.

1664
02:08:48,940 --> 02:08:49,940
No, it's S-Ghost.

1665
02:08:49,940 --> 02:08:50,940
There's an S in there.

1666
02:08:50,940 --> 02:08:53,940
Space Ghost, right?

1667
02:08:53,940 --> 02:08:59,940
I figured it out now, but before I saw S-Goat, and I'm like, what the hell is S-Goat about?

1668
02:08:59,940 --> 02:09:00,940
Space Ghost.

1669
02:09:00,940 --> 02:09:03,940
You idiot!

1670
02:09:03,940 --> 02:09:06,940
All right. Excuse me.

1671
02:09:06,940 --> 02:09:09,940
That's what you get for watching too much porn.

1672
02:09:09,940 --> 02:09:13,940
I think that when we... I think when we come back...

1673
02:09:13,940 --> 02:09:16,940
You know what I'm thinking, guys? I think we should do a Bomani match game when we come back.

1674
02:09:16,940 --> 02:09:17,940
What do you guys think?

1675
02:09:17,940 --> 02:09:18,940
All right.

1676
02:09:18,940 --> 02:09:21,860
And we'll do a Bomani Match Game over Skype actually.

1677
02:09:21,860 --> 02:09:25,460
One person can participate over Skype and the other one will do the chatroom as always.

1678
02:09:25,460 --> 02:09:27,420
So we'll set that up.

1679
02:09:27,420 --> 02:09:28,420
You know what?

1680
02:09:28,420 --> 02:09:29,420
What?

1681
02:09:29,420 --> 02:09:30,420
I need something hardcore to listen to.

1682
02:09:30,420 --> 02:09:32,420
I want to do some Guitar Freaks, actually.

1683
02:09:32,420 --> 02:09:33,420
That's what I was going to say.

1684
02:09:33,420 --> 02:09:34,420
I know, I know.

1685
02:09:34,420 --> 02:09:35,420
I'm stealing your thunder.

1686
02:09:35,420 --> 02:09:37,420
What can I say?

1687
02:09:37,420 --> 02:09:40,180
So we're going to hear Liar Liar, because I know you like that song.

1688
02:09:40,180 --> 02:09:42,060
And PPR, because I like that song.

1689
02:09:42,060 --> 02:09:44,020
And Fireball, because everybody likes that song.

1690
02:09:44,020 --> 02:09:47,500
Alright, so we will be back and then we're going to do Bomani Match Game and I'm going

1691
02:09:47,500 --> 02:09:49,980
find us some contestants because I want to get some people who haven't played

1692
02:09:49,980 --> 02:09:56,980
before. So we're going to get some bamani match game when we come back.

1693
02:10:19,980 --> 02:10:26,780
Ma, ke lon sha, sha te lu tai ba, tsukou lei kou shou

1694
02:10:26,780 --> 02:10:34,620
Da, shite, dan no ton eke kou, dekou lei, nichi o kou, ni sen no wa

1695
02:10:34,620 --> 02:10:43,580
Omei zaou, tsukou jalu toa, tsukou lei, tsukou lei, tsukou lei, tsukou lei, kou

1696
02:11:13,580 --> 02:11:19,580
I should show you how sweet it all is rollin' in

1697
02:11:33,580 --> 02:11:35,580
Daddy do you want the juice?

1698
02:11:35,580 --> 02:11:37,580
Daddy do you want it?

1699
02:11:37,580 --> 02:11:39,580
Daddy do you want the juice?

1700
02:11:39,580 --> 02:11:41,580
7, 2, 1, let's go!

1701
02:12:09,580 --> 02:12:13,580
Come up the stairs, don't stop the fire ball burning out of control

1702
02:12:13,580 --> 02:12:18,580
Kick those potatoes from the bottom of the sky like rock and roll

1703
02:12:18,580 --> 02:12:22,580
Get outta here!

1704
02:12:41,580 --> 02:12:45,580
Kickin' with my transmission, nuclear fissure's made for roll

1705
02:12:45,580 --> 02:12:49,580
I need a guy, I'll be a fireball for an hour to go

1706
02:12:49,580 --> 02:12:53,580
Why let him sit his head and wait for Sally King on a road?

1707
02:12:53,580 --> 02:12:57,580
Speak in his hand, just be a fireball for an hour to go

1708
02:12:58,580 --> 02:13:00,580
I'm gonna getcha!

1709
02:13:00,580 --> 02:13:07,580
It's great, man!

1710
02:13:30,580 --> 02:13:33,580
I'm getting out of this town

1711
02:13:33,580 --> 02:13:35,580
Got to pack my bags

1712
02:13:35,580 --> 02:13:38,580
And bring my wagons around

1713
02:13:38,580 --> 02:13:40,580
Move it out

1714
02:13:40,580 --> 02:13:43,580
To the man in the sky of the street

1715
02:13:43,580 --> 02:13:46,580
Move it out

1716
02:13:46,580 --> 02:13:49,580
When nobody wants to beat anyone

1717
02:13:49,580 --> 02:13:51,580
And nobody's backing me

1718
02:13:51,580 --> 02:13:54,580
I wanna be with the creatures of the grave

1719
02:13:54,580 --> 02:13:57,580
I'll stand by the dark, watch the rain fall asleep

1720
02:13:57,580 --> 02:14:01,580
Grab what you can, we'll hand for the wildcat friend

1721
02:14:27,580 --> 02:14:31,580
Hi, Dead Air. I forgot to queue up a promo. My bad.

1722
02:14:31,580 --> 02:14:37,580
Listen to Orange Lounge Radio, you're a big, stinky, poopy head and it smells like Shermie's litter box.

1723
02:14:37,580 --> 02:14:43,580
Alright, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, and we're going to do a Bomani Match Game.

1724
02:14:43,580 --> 02:14:47,580
I decided tonight I would just hand-pick the contestants. I just basically picked people that said,

1725
02:14:47,580 --> 02:14:52,580
I want to play in our chat room, and I set it up. I picked people that we don't hear from a whole lot.

1726
02:14:52,580 --> 02:15:01,580
So, we're actually going to call our first contestant, because our first contestant is coming in over Skype tonight, and actually, oh god, I hope I have the match game music.

1727
02:15:03,580 --> 02:15:06,580
Oh no! I'm going to be sad.

1728
02:15:06,580 --> 02:15:07,580
You do have it.

1729
02:15:07,580 --> 02:15:08,580
I don't have the...

1730
02:15:08,580 --> 02:15:10,580
I saw it on your list.

1731
02:15:10,580 --> 02:15:12,580
It used to be on my desktop, but I don't think I...

1732
02:15:12,580 --> 02:15:14,580
Because I brought it. I left it on your desktop.

1733
02:15:14,580 --> 02:15:15,580
Did you?

1734
02:15:19,580 --> 02:15:21,580
Didn't we have to download it last time?

1735
02:15:21,580 --> 02:15:25,580
Yeah, I just play it over and over and over again, but it's not messed up enough.

1736
02:15:51,580 --> 02:15:54,580
Let's give our first contestant a little phone call here.

1737
02:15:54,580 --> 02:15:56,580
He's supposed to be there. He better answer.

1738
02:15:58,580 --> 02:16:01,580
Let's click the buttons and get that to call.

1739
02:16:03,580 --> 02:16:05,580
One ring-a-dingy.

1740
02:16:06,580 --> 02:16:08,580
Two ring-a-dingies.

1741
02:16:09,580 --> 02:16:10,580
Hello!

1742
02:16:10,580 --> 02:16:11,580
Yo!

1743
02:16:11,580 --> 02:16:13,580
Hey! How you doing, Dork?

1744
02:16:13,580 --> 02:16:14,580
What's up?

1745
02:16:14,580 --> 02:16:19,580
Hey, I'm getting a little bit of feedback there, so turn down your winamp a little bit.

1746
02:16:19,580 --> 02:16:20,580
Uh, whoops.

1747
02:16:20,580 --> 02:16:24,900
That's all right. All right, Dork is good now. Yes, it's very good. You're nice and clear. We like that

1748
02:16:24,900 --> 02:16:29,900
All right. All right. Good Dork is contestant number one tonight and Dork will be playing against in our chat room

1749
02:16:30,500 --> 02:16:33,560
Kyle Snyder will be the other contestant tonight

1750
02:16:34,220 --> 02:16:38,180
All right. So Kyle versus Dork in tonight's

1751
02:16:38,700 --> 02:16:42,460
Bemani match game. I'm so excited. You know how this works, right Dork?

1752
02:16:44,220 --> 02:16:47,280
Explain it. All right. Well, that's what I always do is I explain it

1753
02:16:47,280 --> 02:16:52,640
Anyway, we're gonna give you a sentence and you will be responsible for filling in the blank in that sentence

1754
02:16:52,640 --> 02:16:57,640
But what you're trying to do is you're trying to match our famous celebrities here in studio

1755
02:16:57,720 --> 02:17:02,060
Who will also be writing something down you're trying to match them. So let's introduce tonight's celebrities

1756
02:17:02,720 --> 02:17:04,720
celebrity number one is

1757
02:17:04,840 --> 02:17:06,440
a

1758
02:17:06,440 --> 02:17:09,800
very famous lady you will recognize her from such films as

1759
02:17:10,440 --> 02:17:12,440
Damn it. That's my chicken pot pie

1760
02:17:12,440 --> 02:17:15,440
Dark Sakura, I don't know.

1761
02:17:15,440 --> 02:17:18,440
Dark Sakura is celebrity number one tonight.

1762
02:17:18,440 --> 02:17:24,440
No, I starred in the Watch Me Shove My Foot So Far Up Your Ass You Taste Toenails.

1763
02:17:24,440 --> 02:17:25,440
Alright.

1764
02:17:25,440 --> 02:17:30,440
Contestant number two tonight, you know him from a variety of gay porno, it is Dark Child.

1765
02:17:30,440 --> 02:17:33,440
I started that movie too, but I enjoyed it.

1766
02:17:33,440 --> 02:17:34,440
Alright.

1767
02:17:34,440 --> 02:17:41,440
Contestant number three tonight is actually going to be the token black chick in the next Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen movie.

1768
02:17:41,440 --> 02:17:43,680
She's going to be their cousin from Africa.

1769
02:17:43,680 --> 02:17:45,120
Oh my god.

1770
02:17:45,120 --> 02:17:46,720
DDR Gaholic.

1771
02:17:46,720 --> 02:17:48,400
Hello everyone.

1772
02:17:48,400 --> 02:17:50,800
I just had to work in a Mary-Kate and Ashley thing in there somehow.

1773
02:17:51,440 --> 02:17:51,760
Alright.

1774
02:17:51,760 --> 02:17:52,560
Oh my god.

1775
02:17:52,560 --> 02:17:57,440
Alright, and our third contestant will also be seen in the movie.

1776
02:17:57,440 --> 02:17:59,760
She will be playing Dr. Evil, however.

1777
02:17:59,760 --> 02:18:00,880
DDR Angel.

1778
02:18:00,880 --> 02:18:03,040
I did not release the Insane Monkey.

1779
02:18:04,400 --> 02:18:05,200
Hi Angel.

1780
02:18:05,200 --> 02:18:05,760
And also-

1781
02:18:05,760 --> 02:18:06,720
Hi Dork.

1782
02:18:06,720 --> 02:18:13,720
Also cameo-ing in the next Mary-Kate and Ashley film as the evil monkey is celebrity number five, Loki.

1783
02:18:14,720 --> 02:18:15,720
Hello.

1784
02:18:16,720 --> 02:18:17,720
I'm sorry, man.

1785
02:18:18,720 --> 02:18:21,720
Also playing tonight, the biggest celebrity of them all, me.

1786
02:18:22,720 --> 02:18:23,720
The biggest ego of them all.

1787
02:18:24,720 --> 02:18:27,720
I just have to say something to Dork because I like his screen name.

1788
02:18:28,720 --> 02:18:31,720
I was in a band called Dork and they have a webpage called Dork.com.

1789
02:18:33,720 --> 02:18:34,720
He's not kidding, it's true.

1790
02:18:34,720 --> 02:18:36,120
Do we have a TV theme?

1791
02:18:36,120 --> 02:18:37,520
Oh, we've got, we've got plenty.

1792
02:18:37,520 --> 02:18:39,220
Originality suck.

1793
02:18:39,220 --> 02:18:42,820
Okay, we're gonna get some kick-ass music here for the TV theme.

1794
02:18:42,820 --> 02:18:43,320
Alright.

1795
02:18:43,320 --> 02:18:44,920
Alright, let's see here.

1796
02:18:44,920 --> 02:18:47,520
How about we start off with, um...

1797
02:18:47,520 --> 02:18:49,220
This is just, um...

1798
02:18:49,220 --> 02:18:50,720
Yeah, we'll just play this.

1799
02:18:52,920 --> 02:18:54,420
Uh...

1800
02:18:54,420 --> 02:18:56,120
Welcome to...

1801
02:18:56,120 --> 02:18:58,120
The Body Match Game!

1802
02:18:58,120 --> 02:18:59,120
Alright.

1803
02:18:59,820 --> 02:19:00,520
Here we go.

1804
02:19:00,520 --> 02:19:01,320
Here we go.

1805
02:19:01,320 --> 02:19:13,160
the hell is this? Alright. Okay, here we go. Question number one. Shut up. Question number

1806
02:19:13,160 --> 02:19:18,080
one. Here it is. There's only three questions tonight. It's a short game tonight. We're

1807
02:19:18,080 --> 02:19:26,500
waiting. Alright. For his birthday, Loki decided he would actually go out and play some DDR.

1808
02:19:26,500 --> 02:19:33,000
as a special present to Loki, the arcade management let him do whatever he wanted to the machine.

1809
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:41,680
So Loki decided to blank. Oh, me? Not yet. Not yet, dork. Think about it. Our celebrities

1810
02:19:41,680 --> 02:19:55,080
are thinking about an answer right now. Alright. Still thinking here, we're getting some answers

1811
02:19:55,080 --> 02:20:04,260
from our celebrities here oh one more time Loki decided he would actually go

1812
02:20:04,260 --> 02:20:08,340
out and play some DDR for his birthday and as a special present to Loki the

1813
02:20:08,340 --> 02:20:12,980
arcade management let him do whatever he wanted to the machine so Loki decided to

1814
02:20:12,980 --> 02:20:19,980
blank

1815
02:20:24,860 --> 02:20:29,540
yeah I know it's the buying a car theme. Alright, everybody got an answer?

1816
02:20:29,540 --> 02:20:34,060
Everybody dinged? Almost. Almost, almost. Jason's still writing.

1817
02:20:34,060 --> 02:20:37,140
Ding dong man, Jason's writing a book.

1818
02:20:37,140 --> 02:20:42,580
Alright, I'm still waiting for Kyle to send an answer. Oh, we got it!

1819
02:20:42,580 --> 02:20:44,260
Oh, we got an answer from Kyle, good.

1820
02:20:44,260 --> 02:20:46,180
All right, Kyle remembers participating via...

1821
02:20:46,180 --> 02:20:49,500
because we can't have multiple people on Skype, so he's participating via our channel.

1822
02:20:49,500 --> 02:20:53,060
All right, here we go. Let's see what we've got.

1823
02:20:53,060 --> 02:20:57,540
For his birthday, Loki decided he would actually go out and play some DDR,

1824
02:20:57,540 --> 02:21:02,300
and as a special present to Loki, the arcade management let him do whatever he wanted to the machine.

1825
02:21:02,300 --> 02:21:05,540
So Loki decided to... what, dork?

1826
02:21:05,540 --> 02:21:11,140
Well, first I thought about, like, he might Matrix Walk the damn machine.

1827
02:21:11,140 --> 02:21:13,140
That's an absurd answer.

1828
02:21:13,140 --> 02:21:18,260
I'm reading the chatroom and Zaku said,

1829
02:21:18,260 --> 02:21:21,140
Dukake the machine.

1830
02:21:21,140 --> 02:21:25,420
But I would say my answer is to hump the coin slot.

1831
02:21:25,420 --> 02:21:27,260
Hump the coin slot.

1832
02:21:27,260 --> 02:21:28,000
Amazing.

1833
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:29,540
Let's see what Kyle thought.

1834
02:21:29,540 --> 02:21:34,820
Kyle said, Loki decided to strip dance on the machine

1835
02:21:34,820 --> 02:21:36,500
was Kyle's answer.

1836
02:21:36,500 --> 02:21:37,460
Pretty kinky.

1837
02:21:37,460 --> 02:21:39,620
Let's see if there's any match for those celebrities.

1838
02:21:39,620 --> 02:21:42,620
We're looking for hump the coin slot and strip dance.

1839
02:21:42,620 --> 02:21:43,620
One of those answers.

1840
02:21:43,620 --> 02:21:45,100
Jamie, what did you get?

1841
02:21:45,100 --> 02:21:49,900
Mine was take an axe after it like they did in office space in honor of the dead step

1842
02:21:49,900 --> 02:21:50,900
mania.

1843
02:21:50,900 --> 02:21:54,540
Ah, take it out and kick the shit out of it like they did in office space.

1844
02:21:54,540 --> 02:21:56,260
Good answer, but not a match.

1845
02:21:56,260 --> 02:21:57,660
Darkchild.

1846
02:21:57,660 --> 02:22:03,380
My answer was toss the salad and stink finger the Olsen twins while video taping from multiple

1847
02:22:03,380 --> 02:22:10,380
angle to make his first feature-length hardcore board.

1848
02:22:13,300 --> 02:22:18,780
That's almost a match with the strip dance one, but I can't give it to you, sorry.

1849
02:22:18,780 --> 02:22:22,340
DD Archaholic, what do you think? I said,

1850
02:22:22,340 --> 02:22:25,820
Hump the Machine. I think that's a match with the coin slot.

1851
02:22:25,820 --> 02:22:29,460
Good job! Dork has one point!

1852
02:22:29,460 --> 02:22:35,180
Alright, Angel, what did you say?

1853
02:22:35,180 --> 02:22:37,180
Loki decided to...

1854
02:22:37,180 --> 02:22:41,180
Pretend he's making love to one of the twins and hump the coin return.

1855
02:22:41,180 --> 02:22:44,260
I guess that's it, that's another match for Dork.

1856
02:22:44,260 --> 02:22:47,180
Hump the coin return, alright.

1857
02:22:47,180 --> 02:22:48,180
Loki what did you get?

1858
02:22:48,180 --> 02:22:49,860
Loki decided to...

1859
02:22:49,860 --> 02:22:54,820
The most obvious outside of the box answer, take it home!

1860
02:22:54,820 --> 02:22:58,820
Take the machine home, where it will be safe.

1861
02:22:58,820 --> 02:22:59,820
Wow!

1862
02:22:59,820 --> 02:23:02,820
That's such a G-rated answer.

1863
02:23:02,820 --> 02:23:07,060
My answer was, Loki decided to, he got to do anything he wants, so Loki decided to bend

1864
02:23:07,060 --> 02:23:16,340
over and shove birthday candles in his ass and shoot them at Golf Land Moms.

1865
02:23:16,340 --> 02:23:19,780
What kind of propellant is he using to shoot the candles?

1866
02:23:19,780 --> 02:23:20,780
Taco Bell.

1867
02:23:20,780 --> 02:23:21,780
Taco Bell?

1868
02:23:21,780 --> 02:23:22,780
Alright.

1869
02:23:22,780 --> 02:23:24,420
Liquid or gas.

1870
02:23:24,420 --> 02:23:26,220
Alright, anyway, let's move on.

1871
02:23:26,220 --> 02:23:27,220
No, worse, Del Taco.

1872
02:23:27,220 --> 02:23:32,620
all right here we go question number two dork is up by two points that's all

1873
02:23:32,620 --> 02:23:36,740
right Kyle here's your chance to catch up all right here it is question number

1874
02:23:36,740 --> 02:23:48,180
two I want music I want me back rhythm dark sacro was so excited that Rob was

1875
02:23:48,180 --> 02:23:53,380
going to be leaving for a whole two weeks when she got to take over his

1876
02:23:53,380 --> 02:23:59,140
computer to run the show she was extra sure to fill it up Rob's hard drive with

1877
02:23:59,140 --> 02:24:02,020
lots of blank

1878
02:24:12,020 --> 02:24:17,740
again dark sacra was so excited that Rob was going to be leaving for a whole two

1879
02:24:17,740 --> 02:24:22,700
weeks when she got to take over his computer to run the show she was extra

1880
02:24:22,700 --> 02:24:29,700
sure to fill it up Rob's hard drive with lots of black. Looking around to see how our celebrities

1881
02:24:31,700 --> 02:24:38,700
are doing. They're writing furiously. I had my answer already. My angel looks like she's

1882
02:24:40,380 --> 02:24:43,980
still working. She's poking holes in the couch or something. What are you doing over there?

1883
02:24:43,980 --> 02:24:49,220
Oh, she's waiting for the pen. Do you have an answer already? Okay. Alright, everybody

1884
02:24:49,220 --> 02:24:55,860
looks like they've just about dinged in so I'm making sure Kyle okay here we go

1885
02:24:55,860 --> 02:25:00,700
all right good we got an answer from Kyle stop the music stop the music

1886
02:25:00,700 --> 02:25:09,060
all right dork what do you say dark Sakura was so excited that Rob was going

1887
02:25:09,060 --> 02:25:12,100
to be leaving for a whole two weeks when she got take over his computer to run

1888
02:25:12,100 --> 02:25:18,540
the show she was extra sure to fill up Rob's hard drive with lots of j-rock j

1889
02:25:18,540 --> 02:25:26,500
Good answer. Let's see if it's a match. Kyle said, fill up Rob's hard drive with Mary Kate

1890
02:25:26,500 --> 02:25:34,460
and Ashley garbage. Running joke tonight. Let's see. Let's see if Kyle gets a point

1891
02:25:34,460 --> 02:25:40,940
off the running joke. Let's see. DarkSakra, you filled up my hard drive with lots of...

1892
02:25:40,940 --> 02:25:45,100
I would treat your computer as well as I do my own. Therefore, it would be filled with

1893
02:25:45,100 --> 02:25:51,100
Ragnarok Online, Wonder Woman Episodes, Stargate Episodes, G.I. Joe Fanfiction, and J-Rock, just like my PC.

1894
02:25:51,100 --> 02:25:54,100
So, I don't know. Does J-Rock count as a match?

1895
02:25:54,100 --> 02:25:55,100
This one is a mini game.

1896
02:25:55,100 --> 02:26:00,100
I'll give it half a point. Half a point. Half a point a match for Dork. Good job.

1897
02:26:00,100 --> 02:26:04,100
Alright, let's see. Just to clarify, but no Mary-Kate and Ashley.

1898
02:26:04,100 --> 02:26:05,100
Oh, hell no!

1899
02:26:05,100 --> 02:26:08,100
Oh, that's unfortunate. Alright. Dark Child, what'd you put?

1900
02:26:08,100 --> 02:26:13,100
You know, I kind of went the same way as Jamie, except I figured she'd put stuff that's, like, on my computer.

1901
02:26:13,100 --> 02:26:20,100
So I said, Chupacabra butt-humping porn hand-selected by me from my personal super nasty collection.

1902
02:26:21,100 --> 02:26:23,100
What kind of porn was that again?

1903
02:26:23,100 --> 02:26:25,100
Chupacabra butt-humping.

1904
02:26:26,100 --> 02:26:28,100
Explain that to me when I'm a little bit older.

1905
02:26:29,100 --> 02:26:35,100
I don't get it. They don't have any actual footage of it, but they have porno of it.

1906
02:26:36,100 --> 02:26:41,100
Well yeah, you can't get a picture of all of Chupacabra, but they managed to get his ass in the film.

1907
02:26:41,100 --> 02:26:47,100
Poor Kyle. Poor Kyle. Let's see if we can get Kyle a match. Let's see if we can get Kyle a match from DDRgolic.

1908
02:26:47,100 --> 02:26:54,100
Oh, I don't know. Let's see. I said the entire collection of Vivid Videos straight porn.

1909
02:26:54,100 --> 02:26:56,100
Oh, Vivid Videos.

1910
02:26:56,100 --> 02:26:59,100
Am I, like, some, like, sex-deprived?

1911
02:26:59,100 --> 02:27:01,100
I don't think so.

1912
02:27:01,100 --> 02:27:03,100
The genius is Vivid. It's okay.

1913
02:27:03,100 --> 02:27:08,100
You know, it's just that Rob's sex-deprived. We were thinking that you might want to help him out.

1914
02:27:08,100 --> 02:27:09,100
Oh, okay.

1915
02:27:09,100 --> 02:27:10,100
Well, that makes sense.

1916
02:27:10,100 --> 02:27:14,100
Or just, you know, ruin his day with something.

1917
02:27:14,100 --> 02:27:16,100
Ew, our chat room's nasty.

1918
02:27:16,100 --> 02:27:20,100
They're saying nasty things about a Kiriyamoka and ferrets being put on the computer.

1919
02:27:20,100 --> 02:27:21,100
Uh-oh.

1920
02:27:21,100 --> 02:27:23,100
Uh, DDR Angel, what'd you say?

1921
02:27:23,100 --> 02:27:24,100
Gay ditter porn.

1922
02:27:24,100 --> 02:27:26,100
Gay ditter porn?

1923
02:27:26,100 --> 02:27:29,100
Okay, ditter sounds like diddling.

1924
02:27:29,100 --> 02:27:30,100
Fine, DDR.

1925
02:27:30,100 --> 02:27:32,100
Gay DDR porn, grand.

1926
02:27:32,100 --> 02:27:33,100
Alright.

1927
02:27:33,100 --> 02:27:35,100
It sounds like a kinky sex act, too.

1928
02:27:35,100 --> 02:27:37,100
Yeah, it sounds like diddling.

1929
02:27:37,100 --> 02:27:41,100
She filled up my hard drive with lots of tech.

1930
02:27:41,100 --> 02:27:43,100
Taku!

1931
02:27:43,100 --> 02:27:46,100
Excellent, excellent, but not a match.

1932
02:27:46,100 --> 02:27:53,100
I said she was extra sure to fill up Rob's hard drive with lots of her bank account information.

1933
02:27:53,100 --> 02:27:56,100
Not a match, unfortunately.

1934
02:27:56,100 --> 02:27:58,100
I have to answer something in the chat room.

1935
02:27:58,100 --> 02:28:00,100
Dark Knight is asking why does that name sound familiar.

1936
02:28:00,100 --> 02:28:06,100
The chupacabra is the goat eater, you know, people in Mexico believe in him and people in Puerto Rico.

1937
02:28:06,100 --> 02:28:07,100
Please change the subject.

1938
02:28:07,100 --> 02:28:08,100
Oh, and Florida.

1939
02:28:08,100 --> 02:28:09,100
All right.

1940
02:28:09,100 --> 02:28:10,100
Last question.

1941
02:28:10,100 --> 02:28:12,600
Kyle, here's your chance to catch it all up.

1942
02:28:12,600 --> 02:28:16,100
I'm casting a hex on Dork so that he will not match you on this one.

1943
02:28:16,100 --> 02:28:19,100
Let's see.

1944
02:28:19,100 --> 02:28:20,100
Rob was...

1945
02:28:20,100 --> 02:28:21,100
Oh, I'm sorry.

1946
02:28:21,100 --> 02:28:22,660
I need music.

1947
02:28:22,660 --> 02:28:23,660
Give me my music.

1948
02:28:23,660 --> 02:28:24,860
Give it to me.

1949
02:28:24,860 --> 02:28:26,540
Thank you.

1950
02:28:26,540 --> 02:28:32,580
Rob was excited to finally get to meet some new DDR players on the East Coast.

1951
02:28:32,580 --> 02:28:38,620
He walked into an arcade in New Jersey and proudly announced to the large DDR crowd gathered

1952
02:28:38,620 --> 02:28:46,980
that my name is Sky and I like to blank.

1953
02:28:46,980 --> 02:28:52,420
Rob was excited to finally get to meet some new DDR players on the East Coast.

1954
02:28:52,420 --> 02:28:56,840
He walked into an arcade in New Jersey and proudly announced to the large DDR crowd gathered

1955
02:28:56,840 --> 02:29:03,840
that my name is sky and I like to blank. Alright, let's uh... Dark Sakura's having a hard time

1956
02:29:12,500 --> 02:29:18,560
coming up with an answer. We'll have to give her an extra minute. My name is Sky and I

1957
02:29:18,560 --> 02:29:25,560
i like to play

1958
02:29:26,200 --> 02:29:28,120
did you do

1959
02:29:28,120 --> 02:29:30,120
waiting on the matter

1960
02:29:30,120 --> 02:29:33,760
waiting on time waiting on dark sacra hope looks like i was lit up there with

1961
02:29:33,760 --> 02:29:36,960
if you got an answer

1962
02:29:36,960 --> 02:29:37,960
finance

1963
02:29:37,960 --> 02:29:41,560
i want to see

1964
02:29:41,560 --> 02:29:44,080
if you could do some very pervert answer

1965
02:29:44,080 --> 02:29:46,400
back to your pervert

1966
02:29:46,400 --> 02:29:51,400
God, a total perv, disgusting.

1967
02:29:52,720 --> 02:29:54,400
Idiot laid or something.

1968
02:29:56,200 --> 02:29:58,920
Kyle's sad because he says if I don't score any points

1969
02:29:58,920 --> 02:30:00,220
it's gonna be really humiliating.

1970
02:30:00,220 --> 02:30:02,880
Look, Kyle, the way it usually works,

1971
02:30:02,880 --> 02:30:06,200
usually it always ends in a tie game of zero zero.

1972
02:30:06,200 --> 02:30:08,560
Dork is exceptionally good at this game.

1973
02:30:08,560 --> 02:30:11,560
This is like playing Ken Jennings at Jeopardy, okay?

1974
02:30:11,560 --> 02:30:13,880
That guy who's won for like 45 times in a row,

1975
02:30:13,880 --> 02:30:15,120
that's Dork, okay?

1976
02:30:15,120 --> 02:30:19,120
I'm sorry, whatever. 75. How many times do you want?

1977
02:30:19,120 --> 02:30:23,120
Alright. DarkSaga, did you get an answer?

1978
02:30:23,120 --> 02:30:27,120
I hope so, because the music's up. Alright.

1979
02:30:27,120 --> 02:30:31,120
What? I'm sorry?

1980
02:30:31,120 --> 02:30:35,120
My name is Sky and I like to blank. Let's see. First off, Dork.

1981
02:30:35,120 --> 02:30:39,120
Let me read it one more time. Rob was excited to finally get

1982
02:30:39,120 --> 02:30:43,120
to meet some new DDR players on the East Coast. He walked into an arcade in New Jersey

1983
02:30:43,120 --> 02:30:48,040
and proudly announced to the large DDR crowd gathered that my name is sky and I

1984
02:30:48,040 --> 02:30:53,040
like to get drunk while running up the walls claiming that he's in the matrix

1985
02:30:53,040 --> 02:31:00,720
and advertising orange lounge run up the wall drunk claiming that he's in the

1986
02:31:00,720 --> 02:31:08,000
matrix referencing our last drunk show and that actually happened and I was

1987
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:12,280
passed out pouring orange on radio let's see what Kyle said Kyle said my name is

1988
02:31:12,280 --> 02:31:17,440
Skye and I like to make fun of celebrities. Which is true! I do like to make fun of celebrities.

1989
02:31:17,440 --> 02:31:23,660
So let's see if anybody got a match on that. Let's go around to... Jamie. Jamie, my name

1990
02:31:23,660 --> 02:31:27,700
is Skye and I like to... I couldn't think of anything. I just said whore out orange

1991
02:31:27,700 --> 02:31:35,180
lounge. Whore out orange lounge. That's a very good answer. Unfortunately, not a match.

1992
02:31:35,180 --> 02:31:42,260
Dark child, dare I ask. My name is Skye and I like to... Can I give my answer last? No.

1993
02:31:42,260 --> 02:31:45,740
Okay, I'm going to try to do it in one breath.

1994
02:31:45,740 --> 02:31:46,740
All right.

1995
02:31:46,740 --> 02:31:51,180
Eat chocolate salad sauce fresh from the arse of young 15-year-old dinner players made only

1996
02:31:51,180 --> 02:31:55,340
from the milk of a virgin dairy cow and the chocolate from organically fed vegetarian

1997
02:31:55,340 --> 02:31:59,300
pieces of trim and toned meat puppets.

1998
02:31:59,300 --> 02:32:01,300
Whatever.

1999
02:32:01,300 --> 02:32:04,980
Oh my God.

2000
02:32:04,980 --> 02:32:08,180
You were descriptive.

2001
02:32:08,180 --> 02:32:12,620
And now we, you know what, this is what happens when you leave Jason at home by himself all

2002
02:32:12,620 --> 02:32:13,620
day.

2003
02:32:13,620 --> 02:32:14,620
Yes.

2004
02:32:14,620 --> 02:32:18,460
Remember, I go to a chiropractor three times a week, what else am I going to fill my time

2005
02:32:18,460 --> 02:32:19,460
with?

2006
02:32:19,460 --> 02:32:20,460
Porn.

2007
02:32:20,460 --> 02:32:21,460
Pukake.

2008
02:32:21,460 --> 02:32:22,460
Alright.

2009
02:32:22,460 --> 02:32:23,460
Anita.

2010
02:32:23,460 --> 02:32:26,660
Both of those were acceptable answers.

2011
02:32:26,660 --> 02:32:30,780
DeeDee Archaholic, not a match unfortunately, DeeDee Archaholic, my name is Skye and I like

2012
02:32:30,780 --> 02:32:31,780
to...

2013
02:32:31,780 --> 02:32:32,780
Play doubles!

2014
02:32:32,780 --> 02:32:33,780
Play doubles!

2015
02:32:33,780 --> 02:32:35,780
PLAY DOUBLES!

2016
02:32:35,780 --> 02:32:37,780
Awww, that's a cute answer!

2017
02:32:37,780 --> 02:32:39,780
But not a magic.

2018
02:32:39,780 --> 02:32:41,780
That's alright.

2019
02:32:41,780 --> 02:32:43,780
For the record, I hate doubles.

2020
02:32:43,780 --> 02:32:47,780
I do like to play doubles, but I only like to do my white boy freestyle to it.

2021
02:32:47,780 --> 02:32:51,780
Alright, Angel, my name is Skye, and I like to...

2022
02:32:51,780 --> 02:32:53,780
Hold on.

2023
02:32:53,780 --> 02:32:57,780
Get down and freestyle to Sexy Planet complete with your bitches.

2024
02:32:57,780 --> 02:33:00,780
Get down and freestyle to what?

2025
02:33:00,780 --> 02:33:02,780
Sexy Planet!

2026
02:33:02,780 --> 02:33:07,180
Oh, the freestyle I wanted to do at the Scandia tournament, but got denied.

2027
02:33:07,180 --> 02:33:08,180
And you had your bitches!

2028
02:33:08,180 --> 02:33:09,180
Alright.

2029
02:33:09,180 --> 02:33:10,380
Whatever you called them.

2030
02:33:10,380 --> 02:33:12,580
Loki, my name is Skye and I like to...

2031
02:33:12,580 --> 02:33:17,260
Yeah, what Jason said.

2032
02:33:17,260 --> 02:33:19,980
So you wrote down the exact same thing that Jason said.

2033
02:33:19,980 --> 02:33:29,340
No, I wrote down, yeah, what Jason said.

2034
02:33:29,340 --> 02:33:31,420
And lastly, my answer.

2035
02:33:31,420 --> 02:33:35,420
My name is Skye, and I like to play DDR.

2036
02:33:35,420 --> 02:33:36,420
Oh!

2037
02:33:36,420 --> 02:33:37,420
Sorry!

2038
02:33:37,420 --> 02:33:38,420
Hello, perverts.

2039
02:33:38,420 --> 02:33:39,420
Hey!

2040
02:33:39,420 --> 02:33:44,080
All right, final tally.

2041
02:33:44,080 --> 02:33:45,580
In second place tonight...

2042
02:33:45,580 --> 02:33:46,580
Tally music.

2043
02:33:46,580 --> 02:33:47,740
Oh, yes, we need tally music.

2044
02:33:47,740 --> 02:33:50,660
I demand tally music.

2045
02:33:50,660 --> 02:33:52,660
Eat chocolate salad sauce.

2046
02:33:52,660 --> 02:33:56,720
All right, that's right.

2047
02:33:56,720 --> 02:34:04,680
In second place tonight is Kyle with a zero point score but because we felt bad for him

2048
02:34:04,680 --> 02:34:12,480
we gave him one tenth of a point so one tenth of a point for Kyle yay thank you for playing

2049
02:34:12,480 --> 02:34:20,680
as our runner up you win nothing absolutely nothing no no no we have to give him something

2050
02:34:20,680 --> 02:34:28,200
air all right we'll send you some air and take a deep breath and in first

2051
02:34:28,200 --> 02:34:38,000

2052
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:45,880
you get nothing absolutely nothing you lose do not pass go do not collect $200

2053
02:34:45,880 --> 02:34:47,680
then go directly to jail.

2054
02:34:47,680 --> 02:34:48,840
Good day, sir.

2055
02:34:48,840 --> 02:34:50,480
You get bragging rights, my friend.

2056
02:34:50,480 --> 02:34:51,480
Good day, sir.

2057
02:34:51,480 --> 02:34:52,800
Turn off the damn music.

2058
02:34:52,800 --> 02:34:53,760
All right.

2059
02:34:53,760 --> 02:34:56,440
But he's actually, I think, he's our high score.

2060
02:34:56,440 --> 02:34:59,160
I think once we had three points.

2061
02:34:59,160 --> 02:35:00,240
That was Puppy.

2062
02:35:00,240 --> 02:35:02,000
Puppy, I think, got a three-point throw-in.

2063
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:02,720
I was close.

2064
02:35:02,720 --> 02:35:03,960
Yeah, you got close once, too.

2065
02:35:03,960 --> 02:35:05,920
I was close, because you know what?

2066
02:35:05,920 --> 02:35:09,960
I feel bad for Kyle, but it's not as bad as eating Jamie's nuts.

2067
02:35:09,960 --> 02:35:13,040
If anybody remembers that, I'm like, what?

2068
02:35:13,040 --> 02:35:14,320
Episode 26.

2069
02:35:14,320 --> 02:35:18,240
My God, you are a living library of this damn show.

2070
02:35:18,240 --> 02:35:21,720
That's right. I love it. Alright. Dork,

2071
02:35:21,720 --> 02:35:26,600
thanks for playing. But, also, you do get a second prize for winning tonight,

2072
02:35:26,600 --> 02:35:27,720
Dork. You know what that is?

2073
02:35:27,720 --> 02:35:31,000
Air? No, you get hung up on.

2074
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:34,200
Alright.

2075
02:35:34,200 --> 02:35:38,160
I got a prize Dork can have. Oh, what's that? When I get home, he could spend like an

2076
02:35:38,160 --> 02:35:41,880
hour in private instant message with me and I could disturb him and give him bad

2077
02:35:41,880 --> 02:35:42,680
dreams and

2078
02:35:42,680 --> 02:35:46,840
torment his mind to where he never wants to listen to LR again, at least not while I'm

2079
02:35:46,840 --> 02:35:47,840
on the show.

2080
02:35:47,840 --> 02:35:48,840
Just find Darkchild.

2081
02:35:48,840 --> 02:35:51,120
Darkchild, do you want to give out your email?

2082
02:35:51,120 --> 02:35:58,400
My email is dchild999, that's spelled D-C-H-Y-L-D-E 999 at yahoo.com.

2083
02:35:58,400 --> 02:36:01,160
Alright.

2084
02:36:01,160 --> 02:36:04,080
I was so mean when I did Dork, but it was hilarious at the same time.

2085
02:36:04,080 --> 02:36:05,080
Alright.

2086
02:36:05,080 --> 02:36:06,080
It's because we love you.

2087
02:36:06,080 --> 02:36:07,760
We do love Dork, but we love Kyle too.

2088
02:36:07,760 --> 02:36:09,760
We love Kyle too.

2089
02:36:09,760 --> 02:36:14,200
In fact, don't we have like a Kyle remix on your computer?

2090
02:36:14,200 --> 02:36:20,440
Okay, as a treat to Kyle for coming in second place, we will play one second of one of his

2091
02:36:20,440 --> 02:36:21,440
remixes.

2092
02:36:21,440 --> 02:36:22,440
So here it is, one second.

2093
02:36:22,440 --> 02:36:23,440
Play the whole song.

2094
02:36:23,440 --> 02:36:24,440
Play the whole song.

2095
02:36:24,440 --> 02:36:26,400
We get one second, because we're running out of show.

2096
02:36:26,400 --> 02:36:27,400
Here it is, one second.

2097
02:36:27,400 --> 02:36:28,400
There it is.

2098
02:36:28,400 --> 02:36:29,400
There it is.

2099
02:36:29,400 --> 02:36:30,400
One second.

2100
02:36:30,400 --> 02:36:31,400
There it was.

2101
02:36:31,400 --> 02:36:32,400
Aw.

2102
02:36:32,400 --> 02:36:33,400
Alright.

2103
02:36:33,400 --> 02:36:38,000
No, maybe we'll play the full thing on a later day when we have more time.

2104
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:41,000
That was kind of like almost having an orgasm.

2105
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:44,000
It was a great drum roll. It was great.

2106
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:48,000
You know, Poto, that's okay if you fill it with spam, because that is my spam email address.

2107
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:57,000
Alright, um, the chat room is demanding a reverse cage match in the near future. We're going to have to do one of those.

2108
02:36:57,000 --> 02:37:03,000
I was going to mention, since he was mentioning disturbing stuff, I'm building my device this week!

2109
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:04,000
Oh yeah!

2110
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:05,000
Oh, you're going to contact the dead!

2111
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:10,860
Yeah, I have to use that magnet wire for something. I'm glad I won't be here for that show

2112
02:37:12,520 --> 02:37:15,320
And you know, isn't that like that movie Prince of Darkness

2113
02:37:16,320 --> 02:37:23,080
Huh? You remember that movie? No. No, I gotta I gotta get that is it Prince of Darkness? It's like another

2114
02:37:23,640 --> 02:37:26,160
Talking to the dead or actually they were talking to the future or something

2115
02:37:26,160 --> 02:37:31,700
They can he can listen to the dead and hear him talk shit about him. Can I hope you test your machine looking?

2116
02:37:31,700 --> 02:37:37,700
Sure. I mean, you know, I could go into the next world and try and talk to you back.

2117
02:37:37,700 --> 02:37:42,700
I can't do that. We need to do our FUs, because we haven't done those.

2118
02:37:42,700 --> 02:37:45,700
Yeah. And we are running on a limited schedule.

2119
02:37:45,700 --> 02:37:49,700
I agree. We do have to. We're not going to take a break. We're going to go right into tonight's FUs.

2120
02:37:49,700 --> 02:37:53,700
So go ahead and send those over private message to Skye. Keep them short. In the chatroom.

2121
02:37:53,700 --> 02:37:59,700
Please keep them short. We have lots of people that want to get read tonight. So keep them short or you're not getting read.

2122
02:37:59,700 --> 02:38:03,700
Alright, here we go. Jamie, why do we do the FUs of the Week here?

2123
02:38:03,700 --> 02:38:05,700
Because we're full of angst.

2124
02:38:22,700 --> 02:38:27,700
My first FUs of the Week goes for the several number of people who tried to run me off the road today.

2125
02:38:27,700 --> 02:38:34,180
I don't have a problem with old people usually, but I have a problem with them driving when

2126
02:38:34,180 --> 02:38:39,580
they drive 30 miles under the speed limit, and that is not an exaggeration.

2127
02:38:39,580 --> 02:38:45,920
It was a freaking 50 mile, no, they were driving 25 under the speed limit, I'm sorry.

2128
02:38:45,920 --> 02:38:49,920
They were creeping down the road, this is like slow.

2129
02:38:49,920 --> 02:38:55,500
It's annoying, let alone dangerous.

2130
02:38:55,500 --> 02:39:07,500
Another SU goes to me not being able to get my laptop so soon, but then again I'm doing the responsible thing, you know.

2131
02:39:07,500 --> 02:39:14,500
Finally got the AC fixed in my apartment, so I retract my SU to the apartment manager's.

2132
02:39:14,500 --> 02:39:17,500
Although we nearly withheld our rent because of that.

2133
02:39:17,500 --> 02:39:26,500
Another F.U. goes to my arms for hurting so freaking bad right now, but that'll be over in a couple days.

2134
02:39:26,500 --> 02:39:31,500
Really, I'm not as full of the angst as I was just because I have A.C. in my house now.

2135
02:39:31,500 --> 02:39:32,500
Very good.

2136
02:39:32,500 --> 02:39:35,500
And the weather's cooling off. It's supposed to be in the 70s. It's coming in a week.

2137
02:39:35,500 --> 02:39:37,500
No way! Awesome.

2138
02:39:37,500 --> 02:39:42,920
And oh, another F you goes to a hurricane Ivan for existing

2139
02:39:42,920 --> 02:39:48,900
Yeah, and of course hitting my it's gonna be heading right on toward my family. Yeah, so

2140
02:39:49,900 --> 02:39:53,120
well, sometimes we have to deal with Mother Nature and I

2141
02:39:54,560 --> 02:39:56,720
Have another one, but it's very vague

2142
02:39:56,720 --> 02:40:02,720
People have been bringing up obscure stuff that's sort of making me scratch my head lately.

2143
02:40:02,720 --> 02:40:08,720
Not like bad obscure things, but just like things I'm like, huh, regarding, you know?

2144
02:40:08,720 --> 02:40:12,720
And like, it happens at work, it happens at home.

2145
02:40:12,720 --> 02:40:19,720
And you know what, if you're going to bring up an obscure reference, make sure I know what the stuff the reference is before you bring it up.

2146
02:40:19,720 --> 02:40:23,720
Dan said something the other day that just was like, what?

2147
02:40:23,720 --> 02:40:36,160
and so yeah so that's it all right let's move on to the ever-so-loving Loki

2148
02:40:38,360 --> 02:40:43,880
yeah fuck you the Benny Hana's because I wanted to go eat there at that

2149
02:40:43,880 --> 02:40:49,640
establishment on my birthday but they said okay so first we had to you know

2150
02:40:49,640 --> 02:40:54,700
They said make a reservation the earliest time they had was nine. I was like fuck that. I don't want you at nine

2151
02:40:54,700 --> 02:40:59,180
I want to eat at six so like fine come on down, and you know you'll just have to wait

2152
02:40:59,180 --> 02:41:03,580
You know you have to wait a few minutes or whatever to get in there. Oh, yeah, that's fine

2153
02:41:03,580 --> 02:41:07,240
You know Saturday you have to wait everywhere so in there. We're like yeah

2154
02:41:07,240 --> 02:41:11,700
We want a table for our six people they're all so how long is it gonna be?

2155
02:41:12,420 --> 02:41:13,720
well

2156
02:41:13,720 --> 02:41:15,200
910

2157
02:41:15,200 --> 02:41:20,920
So fuck them for wasting my time for telling me that I had to wait three hours for a fucking table

2158
02:41:22,240 --> 02:41:23,560
so

2159
02:41:23,560 --> 02:41:25,560
yeah, that fucking sucks and

2160
02:41:26,120 --> 02:41:30,320
I don't know. That's pretty much all I have is just been honest

2161
02:41:30,320 --> 02:41:31,200
They pissed me off

2162
02:41:31,200 --> 02:41:36,840
You know and I just hope I don't get killed by a tree falling over outside because there's an awful lot of them

2163
02:41:36,840 --> 02:41:38,840
They're just limbs are falling off

2164
02:41:38,840 --> 02:41:41,840
That's all. I'm keeping it short.

2165
02:41:49,840 --> 02:41:56,840
No, they get worse. My turn and I would like to give an F.U. to my dad's laptop that he just got from my brother.

2166
02:41:56,840 --> 02:41:59,840
The piece of shit doesn't work. I was so excited because my dad was like,

2167
02:41:59,840 --> 02:42:05,840
Sure, son. You can take this laptop to Pennsylvania with you. Just don't put any pornography on it.

2168
02:42:05,840 --> 02:42:15,880
on it. That's my dad, he sounds like one of the Muppets. He said I could take his laptop,

2169
02:42:15,880 --> 02:42:20,200
but I had to just install Windows on it. Okay, I know how to install Windows on a machine.

2170
02:42:20,200 --> 02:42:24,200
Well, Windows wouldn't install on this machine because the fucking hard drive was broken,

2171
02:42:24,200 --> 02:42:29,500
and it would only recognize that there was a hard drive in there with a size of 16 kilobytes.

2172
02:42:29,500 --> 02:42:33,600
You know what? Too bad you didn't talk to Julie, because she's had that same problem

2173
02:42:33,600 --> 02:42:36,160
before and got Windows loaded up by doing it through network.

2174
02:42:36,160 --> 02:42:37,160
God dammit!

2175
02:42:37,160 --> 02:42:42,440
Sorry, that thing didn't have a network adapter on it and I didn't feel like buying one, so...

2176
02:42:42,440 --> 02:42:46,640
Fuck the laptop and fuck the fact that I will have no way of communicating with my friends

2177
02:42:46,640 --> 02:42:47,640
back home.

2178
02:42:47,640 --> 02:42:48,640
No, I'm kidding.

2179
02:42:48,640 --> 02:42:51,900
I have a cell phone and everybody better call me after six o'clock your time.

2180
02:42:51,900 --> 02:42:54,880
And I'll be updating my photo blog, lots and lots, from Philadelphia.

2181
02:42:54,880 --> 02:42:58,660
Or, I mean, not Philadelphia, but Allentown where I'm going, so...

2182
02:42:58,660 --> 02:43:04,840
And a pre-emptive F.U. to the New Jersey DDR crowd because they will all be better than

2183
02:43:04,840 --> 02:43:05,840
me, I'm sure.

2184
02:43:05,840 --> 02:43:11,780
No, seriously, I was looking at some of the DDR pictures on Freak and stuff and I'm kind

2185
02:43:11,780 --> 02:43:12,780
of scared.

2186
02:43:12,780 --> 02:43:16,940
I hope people don't expect me to be good at DDR just because I have this show.

2187
02:43:16,940 --> 02:43:21,900
Alright, let's move on to Dark Child, dare I let him have a chance?

2188
02:43:21,900 --> 02:43:23,300
I'm gonna try and keep it short.

2189
02:43:23,300 --> 02:43:27,500
I mean, there's still the usual fuck yous to basically the entire White House staff

2190
02:43:27,500 --> 02:43:33,320
right now in Bush, but fuck you to my back for not being better because I can't do shit

2191
02:43:33,320 --> 02:43:34,320
with an injured back.

2192
02:43:34,320 --> 02:43:38,260
No one wants to hire me because I'm either a liability or can't lift shit.

2193
02:43:38,260 --> 02:43:40,500
Fuck you to Workman's Comp for not giving me any money.

2194
02:43:40,500 --> 02:43:43,940
Fuck you to the laws that are in place right now because they fuck over victims.

2195
02:43:43,940 --> 02:43:47,620
Fuck you to SAC PD for not responding when my car was broken into.

2196
02:43:47,620 --> 02:43:49,980
Fuck you to the bastards who broke into my car and stole my stereo.

2197
02:43:49,980 --> 02:43:54,900
I'm poor bitch just like you guys are, so please don't steal from me, and a big fuck

2198
02:43:54,900 --> 02:43:59,620
you to all those French haters right now that keep talking shit about, oh France this, France

2199
02:43:59,620 --> 02:44:04,540
fucking this, wasn't saving their ass in World War I and II good enough for them. People

2200
02:44:04,540 --> 02:44:08,180
tend to forget that when we were trying to get away from England way back when, that

2201
02:44:08,180 --> 02:44:13,180
the French came and saved our asses. Let's give a shout out to Lafayette, right? Lafayette.

2202
02:44:13,180 --> 02:44:14,180
Laffé?

2203
02:44:14,180 --> 02:44:15,180
Laffé.

2204
02:44:15,180 --> 02:44:19,180
It was one of the big people who were involved with that.

2205
02:44:19,180 --> 02:44:20,180
Oh.

2206
02:44:20,180 --> 02:44:21,180
Okay.

2207
02:44:21,180 --> 02:44:25,180
Doesn't anybody pay attention in school?

2208
02:44:25,180 --> 02:44:27,180
A long time ago.

2209
02:44:27,180 --> 02:44:31,180
But I just hate people who bash the French just because they don't want to go into this

2210
02:44:31,180 --> 02:44:32,180
war.

2211
02:44:32,180 --> 02:44:33,180
You know, I think this war is stupid.

2212
02:44:33,180 --> 02:44:35,180
And I think the French made a good call.

2213
02:44:35,180 --> 02:44:38,180
I'd like to order some freedom fries, please.

2214
02:44:38,180 --> 02:44:41,180
I'd like to bash the French for being smelly.

2215
02:44:41,180 --> 02:44:42,180
See, that's alright.

2216
02:44:42,180 --> 02:44:43,700
because they do smell a little bit.

2217
02:44:44,140 --> 02:44:47,180
So I mean, don't talk shit like, Oh, we saved our ass World War II.

2218
02:44:47,180 --> 02:44:48,380
Wasn't that good enough for us?

2219
02:44:48,900 --> 02:44:49,940
Why can't they help us?

2220
02:44:49,940 --> 02:44:50,780
Why are they talking shit?

2221
02:44:50,780 --> 02:44:52,500
It's because Bush fucking sucks.

2222
02:44:53,100 --> 02:44:53,940
Here's another thing.

2223
02:44:53,980 --> 02:44:55,420
We didn't do that.

2224
02:44:55,900 --> 02:45:00,140
Your daddies and granddaddies who are in the military did it or whatever.

2225
02:45:00,420 --> 02:45:04,420
And, uh, yeah, I hate Republicans and I hate Democrats too.

2226
02:45:04,780 --> 02:45:06,180
I hate third party now too.

2227
02:45:06,500 --> 02:45:10,220
Fuck you to, uh, uh, Nader, whatever his name is.

2228
02:45:10,220 --> 02:45:15,020
because his campaign now is trying to get Bush re-elected instead of trying to get him elected president.

2229
02:45:15,020 --> 02:45:19,420
What kind of presidential campaign is that? Trying to get someone else elected president.

2230
02:45:19,420 --> 02:45:22,220
Fucking stupid asses. I hate all politics.

2231
02:45:22,220 --> 02:45:25,620
I'm nonpartisan in case you guys are wondering. I don't belong to any party.

2232
02:45:25,620 --> 02:45:29,520
Fuck them all. You should start that the fuck them all party.

2233
02:45:29,520 --> 02:45:36,620
All right. I usually vote for the radical meadow party for, you know, Bill the Cat in Opus.

2234
02:45:36,620 --> 02:45:38,080
the alcoholic

2235
02:45:38,080 --> 02:45:41,980
uh... i i just want to say fuck you to comcast again

2236
02:45:41,980 --> 02:45:47,260
uh... no wait no SBC i'm sorry SBC actually comcast didn't do too bad this week

2237
02:45:47,260 --> 02:45:50,660
SBC has been calling us incessantly telling us

2238
02:45:50,660 --> 02:45:55,880
that we should get SBC DSL it's just as good as cable right?

2239
02:45:55,880 --> 02:45:58,920
it's just it's cheaper than cable internet

2240
02:45:58,920 --> 02:46:04,040
so we finally gave in and said okay because they told us we do have service in our area

2241
02:46:04,040 --> 02:46:06,840
they told us we don't have servers in our area

2242
02:46:06,840 --> 02:46:09,960
then they called us back again and told us we do have servers in our area

2243
02:46:09,960 --> 02:46:13,640
and had us actually sign up this time. And then they had somebody

2244
02:46:13,640 --> 02:46:17,720
almost out to give us all our servers and everything. And then they called

2245
02:46:17,720 --> 02:46:20,280
back again and told us we don't have servers in the area.

2246
02:46:20,280 --> 02:46:22,340
So they just gave us a runaround.

2247
02:46:22,340 --> 02:46:24,280
I just have to jump in on this one because

2248
02:46:24,280 --> 02:46:28,280
Anitta doesn't know all of it. They actually called. Told me it was available.

2249
02:46:28,280 --> 02:46:31,400
Called a week later. Not available. Called. It was available.

02:46:31,400 --> 02:46:47,400
a week later, not available, called, it was available, called again, a couple days later, not available, called again, it was available, I had her triple check it on the phone, she said it was available, so I signed up. So it was like three or four times they called to tell me it was available, then not available in my area.

2251
02:46:47,400 --> 02:46:50,400

Could I be writing a letter to the Better Business Bureau?

Yeah, something's gotta be done. It's crazy.

Alright, DDR Angel, you're refused.

Wow. I guess he has something to say about that.

2288
02:49:09,340 --> 02:49:14,340
Dork says F you to Sky for hanging up on me like such a bitch.

2294
02:49:38,340 --> 02:49:45,340

2295
02:49:45,340 --> 02:49:56,340

2296
02:49:56,340 --> 02:50:02,340
And F you to my car. I feel like I'm playing Mario Kart in one of the ice stages every time I drive it.

2297
02:50:02,340 --> 02:50:09,240
Ninz says, F you to the remains of Hurricane Francis, we got tons of rain here on Thursday

2298
02:50:09,240 --> 02:50:13,320

02:50:13,320 --> 02:50:18,220
telling me what actual time I'll be working until five minutes before I punch out. F you

2300
02:50:18,220 --> 02:50:21,600

02:50:21,600 --> 02:50:26,240
bus and another is a hypocritical ass. Oh yes, F you to the general population of the

2302
02:50:26,240 --> 02:50:31,600
US, I swear I'm moving to Canada, Bush gets re-elected. I heard a lot of people say that,

2303
02:50:31,600 --> 02:50:34,200
That would be very interesting if that happened.

2304
02:50:34,200 --> 02:50:37,160
Zaku says, my FUs for the week.

2305
02:50:37,160 --> 02:50:39,680
FU to our government for not catching Osama bin Laden.

2306
02:50:39,680 --> 02:50:42,920
FU to me not having a song or routine for the major DDR

2307
02:50:42,920 --> 02:50:45,240
Nationals turning in New York City next month.

2308
02:50:45,240 --> 02:50:48,120
FU to State University of New York's University Police

2309
02:50:48,120 --> 02:50:50,440
for being dicks and shutting down unregistered parties

2310
02:50:50,440 --> 02:50:52,520
this weekend at my campus.

2311
02:50:52,520 --> 02:50:54,680
Skye, the second FU, is a freestyle routine.

2312
02:50:54,680 --> 02:50:55,840
Just making a note of that.

2313
02:50:55,840 --> 02:50:57,600
OK, you got it.

2314
02:50:57,600 --> 02:50:59,640
Jazz says, FU to my mom's driving.

2315
02:50:59,640 --> 02:51:04,000
I've never seen someone break so many road laws so quickly in my life.

2316
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:09,520
Silent Ben says, hands about what's going on on Friday.

2317
02:51:09,520 --> 02:51:11,200
I thought it was nephew.

2318
02:51:11,200 --> 02:51:14,720
Esco says, F you to all the telemarketers calling recently.

2319
02:51:14,720 --> 02:51:16,000
I have a new strategy though.

2320
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:18,080
Skype me to check it out.

2321
02:51:18,080 --> 02:51:20,440
No, I actually, can I make a mention?

2322
02:51:20,440 --> 02:51:20,960
Sure.

2323
02:51:20,960 --> 02:51:23,360
If a telemarketer calls you, tell them to opt you out.

2324
02:51:23,360 --> 02:51:26,400
By under federal law, they actually have to take off the dialer.

2325
02:51:26,400 --> 02:51:35,400
I have to admit, even though he's already been on the show once tonight, I'm just too damn curious on what the hell's going on with this telemarketer thing.

2326
02:51:35,400 --> 02:51:37,400
We have a telemarketer that keeps calling us, too.

2327
02:51:37,400 --> 02:51:44,400
See, with telemarketers, I think you should just say, oh, hang on, let me get the person in charge of the account, and just set the phone down, and leave it.

2328
02:51:44,400 --> 02:51:45,400
Let's see if he picks it up.

2329
02:51:49,400 --> 02:51:51,400
God damn it, answer your phone.

2330
02:51:51,400 --> 02:52:00,400
Ring ring. Ring ring. He said Skype him, here I am.

2331
02:52:00,400 --> 02:52:03,400
Hello?

2332
02:52:03,400 --> 02:52:07,400
Hello, sir! Would you like to take our survey?

2333
02:52:07,400 --> 02:52:10,400
Uh, um, uh, sure.

2334
02:52:10,400 --> 02:52:13,400
No, seriously, what's your strategy for telemarketers?

2335
02:52:13,400 --> 02:52:15,400
Oh. Well, I was trying it. I was trying it.

2336
02:52:15,400 --> 02:52:17,400
Oh, I'm sorry.

2337
02:52:17,400 --> 02:52:19,400
Yeah, I had, like, a whole thing. Sky, you ruined it all.

2338
02:52:19,400 --> 02:52:21,400
God damn it! Okay, sorry. Rewind.

2339
02:52:21,400 --> 02:52:22,900
Put it all on, Skye!

2340
02:52:22,900 --> 02:52:24,900
Would you like to take a survey?

2341
02:52:24,900 --> 02:52:26,900
I had the- I had the band ready.

2342
02:52:26,900 --> 02:52:29,900
Wait, wait, wait. Yeah, he was going to do that!

2343
02:52:29,900 --> 02:52:31,400
That's the best!

2344
02:52:31,400 --> 02:52:33,400
What the hell's going on?

2345
02:52:35,400 --> 02:52:36,400
Hey, I don't know!

2346
02:52:36,400 --> 02:52:37,900
Skye, are you happy, Skye?

2347
02:52:37,900 --> 02:52:38,900
Are they having a party?

2348
02:52:38,900 --> 02:52:40,900
Yeah, I guess. Who's yelling? What the hell?

2349
02:52:42,900 --> 02:52:44,900
What's the strategy? Tell me the strategy!

2350
02:52:44,900 --> 02:52:46,400
No.

2351
02:52:46,400 --> 02:52:48,400
What is the Matrix?

2352
02:52:48,400 --> 02:52:54,300
Excuse me, what is the strategy? What is the matrix the matrix or the strategy?

2353
02:52:56,880 --> 02:53:04,240
You know, I've completely forgotten what it was after all but you know what it doesn't matter it's it's all about spontaneity so

2354
02:53:06,280 --> 02:53:07,920
Yeah

2355
02:53:07,920 --> 02:53:11,120
I'm hanging up on you. I think he's just a Skype whore

2356
02:53:11,120 --> 02:53:15,000
I think he has as much as possible you Skype whore

2357
02:53:15,000 --> 02:53:21,000
Or you need to go to Skyper's Anonymous, get some treatment, because you have a major Skype problem.

2358
02:53:21,000 --> 02:53:25,000
I just wanted to hang up on somebody else, the door doesn't feel so bad, so I hung up on him.

2359
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:30,000
Alright. I guess I fucked that up, my bad.

2360
02:53:30,000 --> 02:53:35,000
Is that all the FUs?

2361
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:37,000
I guess so, that was all the FUs.

2362
02:53:37,000 --> 02:53:40,000
Okay, I got two more real quick ones.

2363
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:42,000
Oh Jesus, what?

2364
02:53:42,000 --> 02:53:46,240
George Lucas, for when he releases his next Star Wars on DVD, the trilogy, he made some

2365
02:53:46,240 --> 02:53:48,240
changes again.

2366
02:53:48,240 --> 02:53:52,160
He needs to learn to keep the movies the way they were, they're classics for a reason.

2367
02:53:52,160 --> 02:54:00,080
And then my other fuck you I kind of forgot, so fuck you to forgetting my fuck you.

2368
02:54:00,080 --> 02:54:03,680
I think we will take a really quick break and then we're going to come back and wrap

2369
02:54:03,680 --> 02:54:04,680
up this show.

2370
02:54:04,680 --> 02:54:05,680
Wait, wait, wait.

2371
02:54:05,680 --> 02:54:06,680
Rob.

2372
02:54:06,680 --> 02:54:07,920
Or do you want to just do some Ask Orange Lounge here real fast?

2373
02:54:07,920 --> 02:54:09,920
I was going to ask Lucas something real quick.

2374
02:54:09,920 --> 02:54:10,920
On air.

2375
02:54:10,920 --> 02:54:24,920
Um, if anybody's a Star Wars fan out there, Lucas has announced, um, 7, 8, and 9. Star Wars. Episode 7, 8, and 9. So I don't know if Loki's heard about that or not.

2376
02:54:24,920 --> 02:54:26,920
Does Loki even like Star Wars?

2377
02:54:26,920 --> 02:54:28,920
I don't really care, actually.

2378
02:54:28,920 --> 02:54:30,920
Yeah, I don't like him either, so...

2379
02:54:30,920 --> 02:54:32,920
Hey, I thought it was just nice to bring up, I don't know.

2380
02:54:32,920 --> 02:54:34,920
Eh, that's alright.

2381
02:54:34,920 --> 02:54:36,920
Alright, let's see.

2382
02:54:36,920 --> 02:54:38,920
I wanna prank call people.

2383
02:54:38,920 --> 02:54:47,120
I'm going to call somebody who's not listening to our show.

2384
02:54:47,120 --> 02:54:48,120
We're being old school.

2385
02:54:48,120 --> 02:54:50,680
There's somebody on the list that's not listening to this show, and I want to call him and find

2386
02:54:50,680 --> 02:54:51,680
out why.

2387
02:54:51,680 --> 02:54:55,880
Hold on a minute, I'm going to see if he even picks up.

2388
02:54:55,880 --> 02:54:59,840
Let me telemarket him.

2389
02:54:59,840 --> 02:55:02,240
Hello?

2390
02:55:02,240 --> 02:55:04,760
Hello?

2391
02:55:04,760 --> 02:55:05,760
Hello.

2392
02:55:07,760 --> 02:55:08,760
Hello.

2393
02:55:09,260 --> 02:55:10,260
Hello.

2394
02:55:11,260 --> 02:55:12,260
Yeah.

2395
02:55:12,260 --> 02:55:14,260
Why aren't you listening to the show?

2396
02:55:15,260 --> 02:55:16,260
Uh...

2397
02:55:17,260 --> 02:55:18,260
Uh...

2398
02:55:18,760 --> 02:55:19,760
I don't know.

2399
02:55:19,760 --> 02:55:20,760
Who is this?

2400
02:55:21,260 --> 02:55:23,260
It's Unknown Gamer, our old pal.

2401
02:55:23,260 --> 02:55:24,260
Why aren't you listening?

2402
02:55:24,260 --> 02:55:26,260
Why aren't you listening? You're making us sad.

2403
02:55:26,260 --> 02:55:27,760
Why aren't you listening?

2404
02:55:28,260 --> 02:55:30,260
Oh, because I'm a little sick right now.

2405
02:55:30,260 --> 02:55:33,260
And you guys have a little too much for me when I'm sick.

2406
02:55:33,260 --> 02:55:36,420
Oh, I'm sorry, bud. Oh, we didn't mean to disturb you.

2407
02:55:36,420 --> 02:55:39,820
It's okay. Alright, you go... Were you sleeping?

2408
02:55:39,820 --> 02:55:43,780
Kinda. God, I feel like a real dick now!

2409
02:55:43,780 --> 02:55:47,500
Hugs and kisses from us to you!

2410
02:55:47,500 --> 02:55:52,420
Alright. Feel better. God, we're bastards.

2411
02:55:52,420 --> 02:55:55,740
You're the one who called him. I didn't call him.

2412
02:55:55,740 --> 02:56:00,820
I'm sitting over here in the big green chair, and Rob's all calling people while they're feeling crappy.

2413
02:56:00,820 --> 02:56:04,820
You are such a bitch.

2414
02:56:04,820 --> 02:56:08,820
Yeah, if he's sleeping, how do you answer his computer?

2415
02:56:08,820 --> 02:56:12,820
Yeah, maybe he sleeps by his computer. Or maybe his computer is in his bed or something.

2416
02:56:12,820 --> 02:56:16,820
If I didn't want to get called, I'd turn the damn thing off.

2417
02:56:16,820 --> 02:56:20,820
Turn on your computer answering machine.

2418
02:56:20,820 --> 02:56:24,820
What? What? What? What?

2419
02:56:24,820 --> 02:56:28,820
What? What?

2420
02:56:28,820 --> 02:56:34,100
Sky got owned. Oh my god, you're so mean, Rob. Rob is evil. Prank call me.

2421
02:56:34,100 --> 02:56:40,100
It's not a prank call if you expect it. Yeah, it wasn't a prank call. We just, you

2422
02:56:40,100 --> 02:56:43,380
know. We announced who we were. We said what we wanted.

2423
02:56:43,380 --> 02:56:50,380
Uh, do you have a Seymour? Seymour Buds? I want a Seymour Buds!

2424
02:56:50,380 --> 02:56:53,660
I'm looking for a

2425
02:56:53,660 --> 02:56:58,860
Oliver, last name Close Off.

2426
02:56:58,860 --> 02:57:02,180
You wanna know what? What? I knew somebody in high school named

2427
02:57:02,180 --> 02:57:05,420
Benjamin Dover. I knew someone named Peter Spank.

2428
02:57:05,420 --> 02:57:09,420
His middle name was Martin so his initials were PMS.

2429
02:57:09,420 --> 02:57:12,660
That's funny. You know his parents did that intentionally.

2430
02:57:12,660 --> 02:57:16,140
I knew someone named Ben Dover.

2431
02:57:16,140 --> 02:57:18,140
Dead air.

2432
02:57:18,140 --> 02:57:19,140
Alright.

2433
02:57:19,140 --> 02:57:23,140
I think it's time to put the nail in the coffin of this train wreck of a show.

2434
02:57:23,140 --> 02:57:26,140
Well, you know, I could have just filled up dead air with more fuck yous.

2435
02:57:26,140 --> 02:57:28,140
That's alright. Let's go ahead.

2436
02:57:28,140 --> 02:57:30,140
Hi, Unknown Gamer.

2437
02:57:30,140 --> 02:57:33,140
Our bestest friend in the whole wide world who's come to this.

2438
02:57:33,140 --> 02:57:37,140
That's okay. You can lash out just like everybody else in the chat room did.

2439
02:57:37,140 --> 02:57:38,140
Hey, Unknown Gamer.

2440
02:57:38,140 --> 02:57:39,140
They got your back.

2441
02:57:39,140 --> 02:57:43,140
Unknown Gamer, if you were asleep, how'd you answer your computer?

2442
02:57:43,140 --> 02:57:49,140
He sounded kind of asleep. I think he was getting busy.

2443
02:57:49,140 --> 02:57:52,140
I know, I totally think we interrupted sex.

2444
02:57:52,140 --> 02:57:53,140
We interrupted some hot nicky.

2445
02:57:53,140 --> 02:57:59,140
Hey, if I was getting some, I would not answer Skype. Or if I answer it, I just answer it and leave it off the hook.

2446
02:57:59,140 --> 02:58:06,140
Alright. God. Oh, we're so rude. Alright, let's finish up the show and get our final thoughts.

2447
02:58:06,140 --> 02:58:08,140
Dark Child, your final thought?

2448
02:58:08,140 --> 02:58:11,140
Republicans suck more than any political party.

2449
02:58:11,140 --> 02:58:16,140
I have a hawkerthorn and he's cute.

2450
02:58:17,140 --> 02:58:26,140
Um, Ivan can suck it. I'm sorry. I can't stress that enough.

2451
02:58:26,140 --> 02:58:33,140
And, Loki, your final thought?

2452
02:58:33,140 --> 02:58:38,140
I need to find a good LCD screen for my portable computer.

2453
02:58:38,140 --> 02:58:46,140
Dart Sacra, your final thought?

2454
02:58:46,140 --> 02:58:53,140
My final thought is, Unknown Gamer is my bestest friend in the whole wide world and I love him so much!

2455
02:58:53,140 --> 02:58:55,140
Don't kill me!

2456
02:58:58,140 --> 02:59:02,140
It was just the name that jumped out of me on the list. He's not in our chat room.

2457
02:59:02,140 --> 02:59:07,140
Alright, and let's see, final word of the show.

2458
02:59:07,140 --> 02:59:11,140
Jamie's making pouty faces, but you know I have to give it to Darkchild.

2459
02:59:11,140 --> 02:59:14,140
Because she's going to take the last word next week when I'm out here.

2460
02:59:14,140 --> 02:59:17,140
Darkchild, the final word of tonight's show, please.

2461
02:59:17,140 --> 02:59:19,140
Analingas.

2462
02:59:19,140 --> 02:59:24,020

These people shot the fade me

2471
03:00:13,480 --> 03:00:14,120

2472
03:00:14,120 --> 03:00:15,620

03:00:15,620 --> 03:00:16,460

2474
03:00:16,460 --> 03:00:18,000
These people shot the fade me

2475
03:00:18,120 --> 03:00:18,780
I'm getting busy

2476
03:00:18,780 --> 03:00:20,560

Coach Z's got money

2479
03:00:23,160 --> 03:00:22,200
But not much

2480
03:00:22,200 --> 03:00:25,120
Coach Z's got money

2481
03:00:25,120 --> 03:00:26,060
But not much

2482
03:00:26,060 --> 03:00:27,440
Coach Z's got money

2483
03:00:27,440 --> 03:00:27,800
BUT NOT MUCH

2484
03:00:27,800 --> 03:00:29,880
I can use a dollar

2485
03:00:29,880 --> 03:00:31,000
I can use a couple of bucks

2486
03:00:31,000 --> 03:00:32,120
I'm so old school

2487
03:00:32,120 --> 03:00:33,160
1, 2, 1, 2

2488
03:00:33,160 --> 03:00:36,660
They tore the school down. Where are my lasers at?

2489
03:00:37,840 --> 03:00:39,840
Where my lasers at y'all?

2490
03:00:40,240 --> 03:00:42,740
Where my lasers at?

2491
03:00:42,740 --> 03:00:44,740
Where are my lasers at y'all?

2492
03:00:45,340 --> 03:00:47,340
Where my lasers at?

2493
03:00:47,420 --> 03:00:50,040
All the people tried to tell me where my lasers at

2494
03:00:50,040 --> 03:00:52,540
and your mother tried to show me all the laser crabs

2495
03:00:52,540 --> 03:00:55,060
and I got a bunch of types of other laser thebs!

2496

2500
03:01:40,240 --> 03:01:41,580
Uh…

2501
03:01:41,580 --> 03:01:58,080
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

2502
03:02:11,580 --> 03:02:13,580
You

2503
03:02:41,580 --> 03:03:09,420
I was trying to send private messages to a certain somebody to apologize for something

2504
03:03:09,420 --> 03:03:14,140
happened earlier in the show because I feel bad about it now but you live you

2505
03:03:14,140 --> 03:03:24,180
learn it's okay I hope I think it'll be okay I have one day we'll look back on

2506
03:03:24,180 --> 03:03:30,980
this and laugh yeah but in the meantime I'm going out of state tomorrow so who

2507
03:03:30,980 --> 03:03:34,560
cares all right I just thought of something what Pennsylvania's near the

2508
03:03:34,560 --> 03:03:41,460
coast kind of ouch oh shit one of my fellow DJ's are gonna be in trouble too

2509
03:03:41,460 --> 03:03:47,680
then I'm not too worried about that hurricane thingy whatever because you

2510
03:03:47,680 --> 03:03:50,400
know I don't think it really floods where I'm at and I'll be on the second

2511
03:03:50,400 --> 03:03:55,880
hotel anyway so I'll be okay of course you're just gonna get the rain part of

2512
03:03:55,880 --> 03:04:02,520
it I think all right um wowie Wow I don't know what else to say during the

2513
03:04:02,520 --> 03:04:07,560
Why don't you tell us, you were just talking to us during the break while the credits were

2514
03:04:07,560 --> 03:04:08,560
rolling there.

2515
03:04:08,560 --> 03:04:12,560
You were telling us about a club you were forming and a poll you were doing.

2516
03:04:12,560 --> 03:04:13,560
I want to hear more about this.

2517
03:04:13,560 --> 03:04:16,400
Tell our listeners about this because there might be other people interested.

2518
03:04:16,400 --> 03:04:22,960
Yeah, well my live journal earlier this week, actually I think it started last week, I put

2519
03:04:22,960 --> 03:04:29,000
up a poll with two questions about Street Fighter, the Japanese movie.

2520
03:04:29,000 --> 03:04:32,000
First question was, have you seen Street Fighter?

2521
03:04:32,000 --> 03:04:36,440
And the second question was, what do you think about Sonny Chiba?

2522
03:04:36,440 --> 03:04:41,340
So Street Fighter is a movie that came out back in the 70s.

2523
03:04:41,340 --> 03:04:50,800
It was either 1973 or 74, starring Sonny Chiba, who's a very big martial arts actor in Asian

2524
03:04:50,800 --> 03:04:52,160
circles and overseas.

2525
03:04:52,160 --> 03:04:57,040
He's just now starting to become fairly popular here because of Kill Bill.

2526
03:04:57,040 --> 03:04:58,040
Absolutely.

2527
03:04:58,040 --> 03:04:59,040
Yeah.

2528
03:04:59,040 --> 03:05:01,640
He's an amazing actor.

2529
03:05:01,640 --> 03:05:04,440
He's an excellent martial artist.

2530
03:05:04,440 --> 03:05:07,760
He's well trained in martial arts.

2531
03:05:07,760 --> 03:05:13,000
I just saw Street Fighter two weeks ago, and it was just a trip.

2532
03:05:13,000 --> 03:05:14,160
I loved it.

2533
03:05:14,160 --> 03:05:15,960
I just wanted to share that with people.

2534
03:05:15,960 --> 03:05:20,920
I wanted to see if other people might be interested, wanted to watch it.

2535
03:05:20,920 --> 03:05:25,560
I would totally, if I could, and I had the know-how, I would totally start a Sonny Chiba

2536
03:05:25,560 --> 03:05:27,280
fan club.

2537
03:05:27,280 --> 03:05:28,280
I don't know if I could do it.

2538
03:05:28,280 --> 03:05:29,800
You could always start one on the internet.

2539
03:05:29,800 --> 03:05:30,800
Yeah.

2540
03:05:30,800 --> 03:05:34,800
I started to look to see if there is one, I don't see there's been one.

2541
03:05:34,800 --> 03:05:36,800
That's what the internet's for, pornography and fan clubs.

2542
03:05:36,800 --> 03:05:37,800
Yeah.

2543
03:05:37,800 --> 03:05:39,800
I've found a fan listing.

2544
03:05:39,800 --> 03:05:42,800
We have the advantage of being a little bit of both, actually.

2545
03:05:42,800 --> 03:05:44,800
A little bit of both?

2546
03:05:44,800 --> 03:05:45,800
Yes.

2547
03:05:45,800 --> 03:05:49,800
Here at Ornishaw's Radio, we are a fan club and a little bit of pornography.

2548
03:05:49,800 --> 03:05:55,800
Oh, that's weird, but it's true.

2549
03:05:55,800 --> 03:05:56,800
It is true.

2550
03:05:56,800 --> 03:05:58,800
Sadly true.

2551
03:05:58,800 --> 03:06:02,880
So, anybody out there have any words for Street Fighter or Sonichiba?

2552
03:06:02,880 --> 03:06:05,480
Well, we're looking in the chatroom.

2553
03:06:05,480 --> 03:06:08,560
Dude, he's so hot.

2554
03:06:08,560 --> 03:06:13,320
How about, if you like ninja movies, he has been in some of the best

2555
03:06:13,320 --> 03:06:18,160
ninja productions ever. I wanted to see the TV series he did.

2556
03:06:18,160 --> 03:06:23,200
Yeah, the Kage no Gunda. Yeah. Oh, I love it. I love it so much.

2557
03:06:23,200 --> 03:06:27,880
By the way, if we ever get to do that, I'll watch it.

2558
03:06:27,880 --> 03:06:30,760
Cool, awesome. I need to find something that's gonna poke a hole in my belt.

2559
03:06:30,760 --> 03:06:34,200
I don't want to go spend 20 bucks on a new belt.

2560
03:06:34,200 --> 03:06:38,400
Ice pick. You have an ice pick?

2561
03:06:38,400 --> 03:06:41,400
Just don't use a pen knife. I've heard really bad stories about that one.

2562
03:06:41,400 --> 03:06:46,720
Yeah, that's why you're wearing it, too.

2563
03:06:46,720 --> 03:06:50,600
No. Okay, I'm going home, bye. Oh, no.

2564
03:06:50,600 --> 03:06:54,200
Oh, we have to say bye-bye.

2565
03:06:54,200 --> 03:06:56,200
Dude, party at my house.

2566
03:06:56,200 --> 03:06:58,200
Actually, it's called going to bed when I get home.

2567
03:06:58,200 --> 03:06:59,200
Okay.

2568
03:06:59,200 --> 03:07:02,200
I actually have to say buh-bye as well. Am I taking you home tonight?

2569
03:07:02,200 --> 03:07:03,200
I'm not sure.

2570
03:07:03,200 --> 03:07:04,200
Oh, okay.

2571
03:07:04,200 --> 03:07:05,200
Good, because I have to finish packing, so...

2572
03:07:05,200 --> 03:07:06,200
Yeah, that's why I...

2573
03:07:06,200 --> 03:07:09,200
I have to pack and, uh, you know, go away.

2574
03:07:09,200 --> 03:07:11,200
And I'm going to miss you guys on Orange Clown.

2575
03:07:11,200 --> 03:07:15,200
Oh, by the way, um, um, um, if you need games, um, come to the car.

2576
03:07:15,200 --> 03:07:16,200
Oh, yay. Okay.

03:07:18,200 --> 03:07:21,200
Uh, and, uh, I'm going to miss you guys while I'm gone again.

2580
03:07:21,200 --> 03:07:22,200
Keep in touch.

2581
03:07:22,200 --> 03:07:25,200
I'll take very good care of your Silent Hill 4 for you.

2582
03:07:25,200 --> 03:07:28,200
For the love of God, don't ruin the show next week. I'm just kidding.

2583
03:07:28,200 --> 03:07:29,200
We'll miss you too, Rob.

2584
03:07:29,200 --> 03:07:34,200
Are you guys coming back next week for the show? Because Dark Sakura and Loki need some people.

2585
03:07:34,200 --> 03:07:36,200
Okay, somebody has to kidnap me then.

2586
03:07:36,200 --> 03:07:37,200
Alright.

2611
03:11:54,020 --> 03:12:10,020
I'm wishing you the bliss of love to find out where my heart belongs

2612
03:12:10,020 --> 03:12:17,020
I'm living to the myth of love

2613
03:12:17,020 --> 03:12:24,020
To find the place my heart belongs

2614
03:12:24,020 --> 03:12:31,020
I'm living to the myth of love

2615
03:12:31,020 --> 03:12:38,020
To find a place my heart belongs

2616
03:12:38,020 --> 03:12:45,020
I'm here in the middle of love

2617
03:12:45,020 --> 03:12:56,020
You'll find the place where my heart belongs

2618
03:13:15,020 --> 03:13:40,280
All the

2619
03:14:10,280 --> 03:14:39,360
I'll see you in the next video.

2620
03:14:40,280 --> 03:14:42,280
Let's go!

2621
03:15:40,280 --> 03:15:41,280
Let's go!

2622
03:15:41,280 --> 03:15:42,280
Let's go!

2623
03:15:42,280 --> 03:15:44,280
Let's go!

2624
03:15:44,280 --> 03:15:45,280
Let's go!

2625
03:15:45,280 --> 03:15:46,280
Yeah, let's go!

2626
03:15:46,280 --> 03:15:47,280
Yeah, let's go!

2627
03:16:17,280 --> 03:16:28,260
And the heat of the night, the night, the night

2628
03:16:28,260 --> 03:16:58,180
Why did our feelings die of action When we fought for satisfaction?

2629
03:16:58,180 --> 03:17:03,180
But our hearts and hearts always save me

2630
03:17:03,180 --> 03:17:05,180
Why?

2631
03:17:05,180 --> 03:17:08,180
There's a love on this magic

2632
03:17:08,180 --> 03:17:12,180
Just a cute kind of tragic

2633
03:17:12,180 --> 03:17:16,180
We were here for the best

2634
03:17:16,180 --> 03:17:20,180
In the heat of the night

2635
03:17:20,180 --> 03:17:24,180
Once you close to the fire

2636
03:17:24,180 --> 03:17:27,180
And the power of our hearts

2637
03:17:27,180 --> 03:17:30,180
You made us meet by the inside

2638
03:17:31,180 --> 03:17:33,180
And I'm here for mine

2639
03:17:34,180 --> 03:17:37,180
Marching close to the fire

2640
03:17:38,180 --> 03:17:40,180
And the power of my heart

2641
03:17:41,180 --> 03:17:44,180
You made us meet by the inside

2642
03:17:45,180 --> 03:17:47,180
And I'm here for mine

2643
03:17:47,180 --> 03:18:05,180
And the heat of the night, the night, the night, the night

2644
03:18:17,180 --> 03:18:27,180
Down around the corner, I head for my phone here

2645
03:18:27,180 --> 03:18:31,180
To see them long chain runners, watch them disappear

2646
03:18:31,180 --> 03:18:37,180
Without love, where would you be now?

2647
03:18:37,180 --> 03:18:45,180
Without love

2648
03:18:45,180 --> 03:19:02,420
You know they're running late without love Where would you be now, nah, nah, nah Without

2649
03:19:02,420 --> 03:19:10,420
Without love

2650
03:19:10,420 --> 03:19:15,420
Well pistons keep on turning and the wheels go round and round

2651
03:19:15,420 --> 03:19:19,420
And the steel rail back holding hard and the miles that they go down

2652
03:19:19,420 --> 03:19:22,420
Without love

2653
03:19:22,420 --> 03:19:27,420
Where would you be right now

2654
03:19:27,420 --> 03:19:33,420
Without love

2655
03:19:36,420 --> 03:19:41,420
Without love

2656
03:19:42,420 --> 03:19:46,420
Where would you be now?

2657
03:19:47,420 --> 03:19:51,420
So my baby on the road

2658
03:19:51,420 --> 03:19:54,420
Don't have business that I lost

2659
03:19:54,420 --> 03:19:59,420
Tryna everyone with a sweeter smile

2660
03:19:59,420 --> 03:20:03,420
Oh tonight I wish you

2661
03:20:03,420 --> 03:20:06,420
Oh tonight I wish you

2662
03:20:06,420 --> 03:20:10,420
Could be killing me but I won't see

2663
03:20:10,420 --> 03:20:14,420
Till you've made it back up again

2664
03:20:28,420 --> 03:20:31,420
There's a place that shouldn't be

2665
03:20:31,420 --> 03:20:34,420
It's far from home

2666
03:20:35,420 --> 03:20:37,420
All the time going by

2667
03:20:37,420 --> 03:20:54,420
Time for a big moment, oh tonight, I wish you, oh tonight, I wish you could be here with me but I won't see you till you've made it back again

2668
03:20:54,420 --> 03:21:10,420
We're going home, we're going home.
