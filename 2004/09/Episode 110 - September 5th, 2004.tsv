330916	331957	I don't know about the rest of you guys.
332877	336781	That's because we don't have to bow down and kiss the ass of the SEC.
337121	338722	We only have to kiss Konami's ass.

410239	413222	So, um, here, how about like a virtual slice of pizza?
414383	414683	Alright.
414943	421928	Maybe, maybe a little bit later we'll, uh, we'll get some, uh... Sure, and I have a special surprise for Loki tonight.

453074	460418	I know a lot of you guys have had bagels on your mind all week, and we will be spreading the news about what the latest clue is all about.
460458	462679	We're not going to... I've got to clarify something, though.
462979	464780	We're not blatantly giving you the song.
465260	466541	We're just giving you a little kick in the ass.
467847	471870	Give me a little kick in the ass to get you charged up and figure out what that song is all about.
472951	474612	All this and plenty of Bomani news.
474672	475292	How was your week?
475312	476153	How was your day?
476273	480096	Ask Orange Lounge and all that crap you've loved for the past four seasons.
480817	484740	When we come back from this break featuring songs from Poppin' Music 11.
485300	494127	In this break we're going to hear a Sana song called Space Dog, Megumi with Frost, and a little bit of Hong Kong magic from Yamato.
494187	495648	We'll be right back.
500823	502384	Can you hear me?
502504	503144	I'm a face door.
503184	504684	The earth is shining blue.
504704	506105	Can you see me?
506265	507465	I'm a face door.

770834	771796	and more.
819636	821257	Hi, this is Mel B of RTF.
821617	826519	And for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join us on all the fun together.
827219	833322	But hey, if you're a broke ass like I am, why don't you come to one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.
833675	835556	It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.
836137	840460	Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.
841180	843081	Gee, that guy sounds awfully familiar.
843381	844242	I wonder who that was.
844382	846604	He sounds like somebody I've heard from very recently.
847344	849606	He sounds very, very familiar to me.
850246	851006	How you doing, FlowWalk?
852327	857131	Oh, man, it's been pretty busy lately and I have no idea who the hell you're talking about from that promo.
857211	860213	Yeah, the answer is hazy.
860273	860913	I don't know what's going on.
861679	863341	Orange Lounge Radio www.orangeloungeradio.com
878590	882713	and click on chat and you can interact with the chat room there.
882853	886236	And Jamie is chatting with our listeners there, having a grand old time.
887476	892420	And she's having to put the smack down when necessary as well because she don't tolerate no flaming.
893100	894702	Except, you know, gay kind of flaming.
894742	895202	That's okay.
895322	896123	But, like, flaming.
896943	897724	Anyway.
900666	902207	Yes, no being a poopy head on Jamie's watch.
902954	906697	Also, we have the Skype line, which we will certainly open up a little bit later in the show.
907277	912061	www.orangelandredo.com and click on Interact With Us and you can find out all about the Skype line.
913662	918866	Anyway, we're going to start off tonight's show as we do every week's show, playing a little bit of How was your week?
918946	919626	How was your day?
920127	924350	And starting us off, as always, our lovely, our own Dark Sakura.
925190	930314	I worked, and I went to school, and then something that...
931440	933962	I'm sure Melody will expand on as well.
935964	943030	We got interviewed for a magazine.
943991	945352	For a Lifetime magazine.
946212	947734	Like Lifetime TV for Women?
947834	951077	I guess so.
951577	953999	For the fitness benefits of DDR.
956881	957082	So...
959198	965401	Coming up next on Lifetime, Sally Field stars in My Burning Vagina.
968123	974106	A story about a woman overcoming her vaginal difficulties in that time of the month.
974827	978209	Also coming up, Sharks Girl and Dark Sakura interviewed about DDR.
984875	989438	DDR Stop... Hear how DDR helped them overcome their burning vaginas.
994182	994982	God, I love this show.
1000126	1001567	We jumped the shark like when?
1002148	1003849	Like episode two?
1003949	1004489	Episode two.
1004970	1007372	Because I wasn't here.
1007472	1008332	That set the pace.
1008352	1010154	Jamie's going on vacation for two weeks.
1011795	1013236	Like, bye y'all, I'm going to Alabama.
1014665	1024328	Anyway, so my week has been kind of okay.
1024728	1030429	I just hung out, did stuff, went to school, spent a lot of time at school, did homework.
1031110	1034551	Because I still have no air conditioning, but that's coming up in the FUs of the week.
1035551	1042713	And that's really... By the way, as a reminder, Orange Launch Radio is based in the Sacramento Valley, where we get temperatures of 110 degrees in the summertime.
1043533	1045834	Yeah, and if you don't have AC, it sucks.
1046755	1049696	And if you don't have AC in your car, it sucks even more.
1049716	1051617	Because I could have just escaped to my car.
1052138	1053759	Dan's like, summer's almost over.
1053959	1055760	We don't have to get AC for your car now.
1056160	1062843	As my mother said, you use the old 2 and 70 trick.
1062883	1064684	You roll down two windows and drive 70 miles an hour.
1066165	1066625	You know what?
1066666	1069167	That would work if one of my windows would roll down.
1070327	1071068	Use in the ghetto.
1071929	1076172	Dude, no, it's not, I don't know what it is, but after my car got raped, it hasn't been the same.
1076192	1079614	Your car got raped?
1079654	1080975	My car got raped, remember?
1081135	1083056	Did it have a burning vagina afterwards?
1084077	1085137	It got raped in the side.
1085577	1085818	Oh, okay.
1085938	1086998	Remember when they broke it in half?
1087018	1088399	Oh my god, it got raped in the ear?
1088599	1088879	Yeah.
1088980	1089380	Amazing.
1090040	1094283	I guess they didn't think my car, you know, well they did get, they did, you know, get in the rear end too, you know, my truck.
1094323	1096804	The trunk was all empty.
1096844	1099106	Your car got it in the rear end.
1099626	1100967	Dude, my car was all fucked up.
1101983	1103264	At least it has the back window now.
1104124	1104404	Okay.
1108426	1110267	Anyway, I'm laughing at the chatroom.
1110307	1116390	Yeah, I'm playing mommy in the chatroom because there was this stupid fucker in there earlier who was being an asshole to everybody.
1117150	1118771	So now he doesn't get to play with us anymore.
1119611	1120652	And that made me feel good.
1121732	1123473	Because I feel good when I do my job.
1123873	1126594	And when you were young, did you used to ban children from the playground?
1127375	1128815	No, I just beat them with sticks.
1128835	1129676	Okay.
1129776	1130036	Okay.
1130971	1134955	and played tetherball with them and then aimed the tetherball at them.
1137017	1139099	I play well with others when they're the target.
1140460	1140720	I'm done.
1141901	1142322	Moving on.
1142502	1144023	DDR Angel, how was your week?
1144063	1144544	How was your day?
1144944	1145945	Well, let's see.
1145985	1147967	You better have a mic nearby because you may laugh at this.
1148948	1152972	I found out... I mean, what?
1154392	1159836	Okay, I found out that there is a haunted house by my old house that I used to live at that I just moved away from.
1159856	1161318	Is this the fort?
1161438	1162218	No, it's not the fort.
1162298	1162799	But you know what?
1163099	1168884	I was going to blame it on Loki's little portal from hell, but I can't because it's not even built yet.
1170105	1177991	And then, after I found out about the house, I found out that two days ago it miraculously burned down...
1178712	1184275	without affecting any of the vegetation around it or the oak tree that was right next to it.
1184415	1186336	I see burning as a running theme on tonight's show.
1186797	1192720	Apparently.
1192980	1194861	Let the joke die.
1195201	1196902	Step away from the joke.
1196982	1199704	Speaking of joke, should I reveal it now or later?
1201145	1202826	I think we need to do Loki's present now.
1202846	1203266	Okay.
1203286	1203506	Okay.
1204492	1205633	Let's embarrass him now.
1205953	1206213	Okay.
1206373	1207313	Come on, Loki.
1207614	1207834	Good.
1207874	1208394	You know what?
1208454	1212156	I'm going to have the mic in my hand and I'm just going to talk the whole time.
1212656	1213896	But my birthday's not until next week.
1214537	1215637	I don't care.
1215677	1217138	You're getting your birthday present now.
1217238	1220219	I like it when I get presents early because it makes my birthday last longer.
1221700	1221960	All right.
1223201	1225602	Loki's going to open the gift.
1225742	1228743	I need some good gift opening music here if I can find something.
1229424	1232585	And you have to promise that I get to take a picture of it afterwards.
1233706	1234046	That's all.
1235029	1238671	and I will give the picture up to OrangeDanceRadio.com to post it.
1238791	1239331	Because it's funny.
1241132	1242212	Because there's no lid.
1244573	1244954	Alright.
1245474	1246374	He's opening the gift.
1246814	1247855	He is opening the gift.
1248115	1251397	And mind you, this is a joke upon all jokes.
1251717	1252697	I thought it was really cool.
1253918	1254718	Hopefully he likes it.
1259620	1260701	It must go on the webcam.
1260801	1261201	Oh my.
1261261	1261781	Other side.
1262061	1263062	It's a little baby...
1263635	1264135	Yes, it is.
1264495	1266136	But what is the baby holding?
1268657	1269498	Did it drop something?
1269538	1270378	I think it dropped something.
1272599	1273339	Besides the card.
1277041	1285024	I had a little help with the artwork, but... For those listening at home, Loki has been given an Iraqi suicide baby for his birthday.
1287385	1290587	For those who have been listening about 50 episodes ago, you'll get that inside joke.
1291221	1292342	It's a bad inside joke.
1292642	1294043	I admit it's a bad inside joke.
1294323	1298545	It's one that, you know, we've burnt to the ground, but hey, I said burnt at Gatsby.
1298805	1299806	Okay, anyway.
1300166	1301147	Hey, I thought it was cool.
1301507	1302147	I hope he likes it.
1302688	1304529	It needs to go on the webcam, though, because it's funny.
1314454	1315875	So, he broke the webcam.
1315895	1316535	Five seconds.
1320143	1326587	Angel, is there anything else you wanted to talk about with your week and your day?
1327527	1328588	Not that I can think of at the moment.
1328988	1330389	I will probably give the mic later.
1331770	1334011	Then let's speak to Mr. Floatwalk.
1334091	1334691	How was your week?
1334732	1335292	How was your day?
1336172	1336593	The week?
1336713	1347459	Well, anyone who knows what I do, it's just been non-stop work for this whole week with so many things getting ready to ship out for this Christmas season.
1348602	1350243	I heard a rumor you work for some game company.
1350643	1352125	Yeah, who'd have thunk it?
1353126	1360732	Let's see, but the cool thing about that, I managed to steal myself some good swag during the week, got some Silent Hill 4 posters.
1361333	1362894	I didn't start borrowing without returning.
1364055	1364956	Nah, it was given.
1365176	1366017	I asked and I took.
1366838	1375185	It's a cool thing to go into their boiler room and see all the promo stuff from every game that's ever been made, and posters, boxes, all that.
1375768	1376168	Pretty neat.
1376268	1378589	And I saw about 500 Extreme V-Rares.
1379890	1381451	Can I visit Konami and borrow things?
1382951	1384312	Well, you do know me, you know.
1384372	1386853	I mean, my name does have a lot of clout out there.
1387093	1388674	Just don't turn to a name dropper, you know.
1388714	1390275	That would be bad.
1390315	1390655	I won't.
1390695	1393236	I'm not like a particular pool ball.
1393276	1394117	Anyway, sorry, sorry.
1394217	1396038	But yeah, the other stuff in the week.
1396258	1399399	I actually went to a concert on Friday night.
1400320	1403421	Went to go see Kanye West and Usher in concert.
1404141	1405162	And that was...
1405518	1411363	It was a pretty happening event, but I must say, it was pretty entertaining just to see the crowd.
1414907	1416788	What kind of crowd did they have at an Usher concert?
1416849	1417329	I'm curious.
1418270	1418991	Everything you expect.
1419051	1422514	Every girl from like 12 to 35, you know, just chicks everywhere.
1422634	1425056	Did Usher take his shirt off at some point during the concert?
1425296	1425877	Oh, you could tell.
1425917	1427198	You didn't even have to see the stage.
1427418	1430621	You just heard like the loudest screaming you've ever heard.
1430881	1431322	Imagine like...
1431961	1433381	20,000 Banshees going wild.
1433582	1436402	That was just real.
1436943	1440684	I mean, it's funny to see just how girls react over just one guy on stage.
1440744	1451447	I mean, one of the funniest stories about that, I mean, I have like so many stories about that concert alone, but probably the funniest one was, there's one part, like in the middle of the show, where he's doing a ballad.
1452127	1455728	So normally what any singer does, he grabs some lucky woman off the stage and
1456209	1456949	He's going to serenade her.
1456989	1459610	So he looks around and he points out this one gal in the crowd.
1459890	1463691	And when you see this gal, like the spotlight's going on her, she's like totally freaking out.
1464011	1468492	She's, you know, you just look at her face because they put the, you know, camera on the projection screen.
1468952	1474614	And I can say from the time she got picked to the time she got off stage, you did not see her smile once.
1474934	1479575	She was too busy, totally like freaking out, making the sad face like, like, I don't know.
1479595	1481016	Maybe her vagina was, never mind.
1483867	1484408	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1514585	1519307	Seriously, but it's funny because now you see Usher get up on stage and he's like walking slowly, taking his time.
1519608	1522009	He gets up there, you know, he's got like a bouquet of flowers for her.
1522449	1528852	And you can like, when the camera zooms in on her, you can see her face, she's like mouthing I love you to her, you know, to him, which is pretty standard.
1529273	1530193	Any fan would do that.
1530213	1532074	Yeah, I know I would.
1532314	1538557	Okay, and then so finally, like just somewhere around the part where, you know, he's talking about, you know, I'll get down with you and all that kind of stuff, where he's singing that.
1539238	1541219	I swear to God, I'll put $20 on this.
1541259	1543600	You can ask Mike, you can ask Little B who saw this.
1544048	1546649	I swear she mouthed the words, I'll let you fuck me.
1550470	1552831	I was just like, damn.
1553571	1555772	I mean, there's just some whores in this world, I guess.
1555872	1559333	I mean, I know if it's an Usher concert and a girl says it to a guy, he's flattered.
1559353	1563254	I know if Beyonce pulled me on stage and I pulled that, I'd be out in cuffs in like three seconds.
1563935	1565695	So, I just found that kind of curious.
1565795	1567216	But overall, it was pretty fun.
1567616	1568196	And then, um...
1568860	1573445	Yeah, today it's just been coming up from the bay up to Sacto and hanging out with you guys.
1573586	1574987	And the fun's only just begun.
1575147	1575548	That's right.
1575588	1577290	We always appreciate it when you come and hang out.
1577410	1579913	Because it's always a good excuse to go have Mongolian barbecue as well.
1580193	1580493	Always.
1581194	1585439	And before I pass the mic, I just want to say what's up to the chat room, especially up to Sigurd and Kyle.
1585840	1586140	Word.
1586604	1587184	I got mad loves for you.
1587264	1590306	And even though my new office mate is still psycho, I still hold a little place in my heart for you.
1590326	1592567	And I still have a Silent Hill 4 poster if you come back.
1592587	1593607	If I gotta bribe you, I'll bribe you, man.
1593627	1594548	How's your tip jar doing?
1616272	1616652	We are over $30.
1618073	1619554	Where the hell is all this money coming from?
1619954	1628560	Okay, well, I explained it a little earlier in the DDR Freak Boards, but the short of it was essentially... Me and Sigurd, we used to have a bunch of stuff in our cube.
1628600	1633743	Like, if you saw the first montage we ever did, we had, like, red vines, we had, like, granola bars and all that stuff.
1634103	1635344	And so our boss came in... The clue?
1635584	1636185	Clue?
1636265	1636785	Yeah.
1636825	1638386	Clues, quote.
1638966	1640767	Actually, I wanted to ask you real fast.
1640808	1644770	Did you want to issue, like, a formal apology to the users of DDR Freak Boards?
1645273	1645854	for what you did.
1646294	1647215	I will say this.
1648536	1650178	You guys totally assumed it was a clue.
1650358	1653260	I only said, which of these would you like to have right about now?
1655302	1656263	I didn't mean to lead you on.
1656303	1657184	You led yourselves.
1657985	1659066	That's your own damn fault.
1659106	1662549	I was going to tell you not to apologize, but... Yeah, that's their own damn fault.
1662949	1665972	I tried to say about the inkblot thing, but nobody listens to Scott.
1666052	1666693	I know, man.
1666713	1669235	You're the third eye of, you know, DDR Freak up in this piece.
1670136	1670536	That's alright.
1670596	1671037	But, um...
1671881	1672922	Oh gosh, where was I at?
1672962	1680230	Yeah, so the story was we had a bunch of stuff and then our boss came in one day on a Friday afternoon and saw that we had a bunch of granola bars.
1680591	1686758	And so he just kind of walked up to us, not saying a word, grabbed about three granola bars, dropped a dollar on the table and just walked off.
1687178	1689401	We were like, what the hell did he just do?
1690132	1692613	We were just thinking for the rest of the day, wow, that was kind of freaky.
1692853	1703355	And he comes back to us later and tells us, well, he was doing interviews all day for people coming to Konami, and he just didn't have time to go on a lunch break, and so he figured, well, hey, the testers have food.
1703715	1710597	So he just grabbed some from us and dropped the dollar as just payment for, well, I don't want to feel like I'm mooching.
1710977	1714358	And then just people started picking up on it, and then what started out as like $1.82 came into...
1717221	1719822	I know, I single-handedly put $2.50 in that jar.
1720162	1727204	Yes, you did, and Sharkskull put in her tip as well, and she don't even work there, so just the fact that people are... What exactly is she tipping?
1728645	1729565	Never mind, never mind.
1731766	1733146	It's not a burning you-know-what.
1734167	1735247	No comment.
1739068	1742009	But yeah, that is a week in the life of moi.
1743150	1744590	Alright, sounds good.
1745603	1746444	Sharks, girl.
1747324	1747965	Hi.
1748225	1749426	Hello, long time no see.
1750307	1755711	Since like, what, a couple weeks ago on the great mini-golfing expedition?
1755911	1757692	Oh, that was beautiful.
1757993	1764578	The night we weren't allowed to go to the Konami dinner, we were excommunicated from the dinner, so we had to go miniature golfing at Miggle.
1764598	1769021	Although I have to say, Mel and I went miniature golfing in Santa Cruz last week, and I beat him by one.
1769441	1770162	Good job.
1770182	1771343	Pretty freaking proud of myself.
1771463	1773845	Although I would like to remind you that I did school you at Miggle.
1774690	1775791	Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever, bitch.
1777972	1778312	Alright.
1778852	1780313	I was just letting you win.
1780333	1782294	Oh, I see.
1782374	1783275	Oh, she let me win.
1783295	1783955	Did you guys hear that?
1783975	1784895	She let me win.
1787517	1788837	Yeah, them's fighting words, huh?
1788957	1789298	Uh-huh.
1791579	1793060	Alright, so what else did you do this week?
1793080	1793720	Anything exciting?
1794834	1798335	I worked, which is more so suited for the FUs of the week.
1798775	1799235	Oh, okay.
1799255	1804896	And then I woke up yesterday thinking, I'm going to have a wonderful Saturday, and realized I could not turn my head to the right or the left.
1805756	1806196	Oh, no.
1806256	1809337	So, my neck's been kind of sucked sore, and it still hurts.
1809377	1810857	That's why I let Mel drive up here.
1811658	1815018	And, yeah, I've just been kind of like, hmm, yay, pain.
1815378	1817359	Back medicines are your friend, although they make me sleep.
1818259	1821179	So, I've just been kind of really out of it, even for me.
1822040	1822860	Hmm, cry.
1823460	1823620	So...
1824468	1826530	I'll go back to work and I'll have an excuse for being a bitch.
1830132	1832794	Any shoutouts or anything you want to plug while you're here?
1833735	1836097	I am now addicted to Mario vs. Donkey Kong.
1837538	1839760	That was a game I could not get into for some reason.
1839820	1841601	I just played it for five minutes.
1841661	1843723	I'm like, I must buy this game.
1843743	1846505	I don't know why, it just didn't... Mario vs. Donkey Kong.
1849687	1850988	Oh, she's handing me the Game Boy again.
1853393	1854933	Yeah, except Mel just dropped it.
1855353	1856314	Angel comes prepared.
1856774	1857494	That's right.
1858374	1859114	Anything else you want to share?
1859795	1860635	No, I'm boring.
1861215	1861515	Fine.
1861915	1862255	No, you're not.
1862275	1862755	You're not boring.
1863635	1864096	I'm boring.
1864176	1865416	Okay, I have to pull the joke now.
1865516	1868317	If I didn't have this show, I would be like the most boring man in the world.
1868437	1868857	Yeah, Angel.
1869057	1871497	I was going to say, okay, I must pull the joke now.
1871557	1873798	Do you realize you have all three Mels on the couch?
1875138	1875838	Oh, that's a good point.
1876178	1876478	Yeah.
1876979	1878319	But people don't know your real name.
1878359	1879359	You just gave it away, Angel.
1879959	1881100	Well, hey, hey, hey.
1881120	1882200	It's only the first three letters.
1882280	1883140	They can guess the rest.
1884116	1885057	No, nobody started guessing.
1885217	1885537	No.
1886078	1886538	Let's see.
1887118	1888259	Yeah, I'm Mel.
1888780	1889080	No.
1889560	1890021	No, I'm not.
1890101	1892122	No, he's Float Walk, remember?
1892703	1893944	Float Walk.
1894044	1894564	Yeah, see?
1895085	1895905	Loki, how was your week?
1895925	1898367	How was your day?
1898908	1903591	My day would have been better if my shit didn't crap out on me.
1903611	1904272	Shit crap out on you?
1904292	1905613	I hate it when my shit craps.
1907875	1910197	No, I'm talking very vague.
1910277	1910537	I mean...
1910967	1914008	I'm talking about the little board that I had for my cabinet.
1914448	1917450	Not necessarily a main one because, you know, I didn't play with that today.
1917570	1923172	I got my smaller one that I was using for main before, but it's now being used for everything else.
1923532	1925153	Crapped out, and I don't know why.
1926393	1929054	Might have something to do with my shitty soldering job to fix it.
1929854	1931475	I mean, that might have something to do with it.
1931595	1932576	So I have to get a new one.
1932816	1933436	That sucks.
1933816	1935577	But at least it'll be nice and brand new.
1936077	1936197	Um...
1937930	1939972	Well, we did get to play a little bit of DDR today.
1939992	1943394	I had it set up so we could play and it was pretty.
1944395	1948919	And my pads worked really well, but they're loud still, so that sucked.
1949259	1954643	Then yesterday we went to play QZAR and that rocked because, of course, I kicked ass anyways.
1955744	1957285	I kicked ass without even effort.
1957706	1958446	Without effort.
1958647	1962610	I was actually spinning around on my ass in the middle of the arena shooting people.
1963150	1965392	Behind my back, all that kind of cool stuff.
1966944	1967645	Because I rock.
1967785	1977172	Anyways, and then I tried playing DDR on doubles and stuff at the arcade, and I realized I have no more endurance anymore.
1977252	1977953	It's just gone.
1978353	1981095	So, yeah, I felt like I was going to die.
1981655	1986959	And, yeah, my feet hurt a lot from all the walking from playing QZR.
1986979	1988020	That kind of sucked, too.
1989041	1990042	And since...
1990871	1992932	The girlfriend and sister aren't here.
1993373	1995414	The thing that I thought was haunted is not haunted.
1995494	1996335	I wasted my money.
1996395	1996895	I'm an idiot.
1998616	2000897	That's all we need to know.
2001638	2004540	And that sucked.
2004640	2011164	For those who were listening Wednesday, I bought a haunted doll off the internet, supposedly.
2012625	2013826	But, you know, whatever, it wasn't.
2013906	2014526	So that sucked.
2015127	2015867	And I hate it.
2016367	2016908	Woo, food!
2019590	2019710	Aww.
2020700	2021120	No food.
2022340	2023141	And a new guest.
2024161	2025681	Um, but anyways, yeah, so that was that.
2025801	2026961	And, uh, for that.
2027081	2032363	But, um, oh, and I made a CD, my CD, for my remixes and stuff.
2033403	2035483	And, um, yeah.
2036203	2038724	That's pretty much all that I did this week, I think.
2038784	2039704	Oh, and a lot of Final Fantasy.
2041144	2044725	And Loki will be giving away copies of his CD to some of our in-studio guests tonight.
2044785	2045585	Won't that be exciting?
2047266	2047566	Alright.
2048426	2048506	Uh...
2049105	2050906	Who else wants to play How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day?
2051007	2052488	Jonas, hello, thank you for joining us.
2053769	2054329	Hey, what up, y'all?
2054489	2055650	How was your week, how was your day?
2057371	2057992	Ups and downs.
2058312	2060114	The ups was the tournament being okay.
2060954	2062235	Give us the candy a good time.
2062576	2064097	Oh, I completely forgot about that.
2064137	2064297	Yeah!
2065031	2065712	Thanks for watching!
2084358	2086282	Back to School Bash Back to School Bash
2098207	2099988	Mel wanted to share something about the tournament.
2100268	2100729	I mean, float.
2100929	2107073	I'm just saying, if it was a back-to-school tournament, why weren't they giving away some cool prizes like some Trapper Keepers?
2107293	2108174	Yeah!
2108554	2110035	DDR Trapper Keepers!
2110995	2114978	If it was a back-to-school tournament, why were they holding it on a school night?
2115418	2116139	No, no, no, no.
2116159	2118080	The Trapper Keeper is bad news.
2118200	2119401	I mean, we saw South Park.
2119421	2121302	We know what can happen with Trapper Keepers.
2122170	2125052	Maybe they could give away Butterfly Binders.
2128996	2129336	Kill me.
2131778	2134000	So I was actually surprised at the turnout for a Tuesday night.
2134060	2134480	I really was.
2134580	2137983	But a bunch of people I didn't know, and it was interesting.
2138364	2140686	Yeah, new faces I didn't even know as well.
2141146	2146230	So was the money raised from this thing to go towards making their marquee look non-ghetto?
2146691	2149733	Because their marquee is pretty crap.
2150434	2150654	I mean...
2151365	2156288	It looked like, you know, I'm gonna glue stuff to a piece of wood, and it'll be our marquee.
2157168	2162611	Well, they're using the money to actually build the actual Scandia place, like the paths to be better, the speakers.
2164352	2167494	Maybe they can not spend it on more skee-ball machines.
2167914	2173477	My god, they have like eight skee-ball machines in there in the shooting gallery.
2173697	2176299	Maybe they can use it to dismantle the damn shooting gallery.
2177571	2179373	Shooting galleries are fun to annoy people.
2179574	2181577	Dude, the shooting galleries suck.
2182077	2187225	My whole reason for going to Scandia had DVD drive failure.
2187245	2190009	They're sending it to Reno.
2190029	2190510	It's gone.
2191231	2191752	It's gone.
2194980	2195300	Damn it!
2195860	2197381	Alright, so we had the little tournament.
2197461	2202424	I dropped in for about 45 minutes, and I was pissed off because they weren't doing freestyle, and I was going to do an exhibition freestyle.
2203004	2206586	Dr. Dick was going to come out and do Sexy Planet, but I got denied.
2207987	2215310	And I had my hoes and everything, and I had my uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh part all figured out.
2215350	2216071	Denied.
2217552	2218312	Stupid Scandia.
2218432	2221554	I am a total dance attention whore when it comes to freestyle tournaments.
2222074	2223895	I can't wait for Spiggle 3, that's all I have to say.
2224452	2228195	They actually gave me some news towards how they're going to do tournaments and stuff for Scandia.
2228475	2229937	They're thinking about doing it every month.
2231578	2231918	Oh, man.
2231938	2232879	Yeah, I know, exactly.
2233379	2235241	Ding, ding, ding, oversaturation's calling.
2237142	2239364	Anyway, anything else interesting happening this week?
2239985	2245069	I got another contact from someone who has organized Madden tournaments and various other video game tournaments.
2245489	2247330	They're thinking about getting to the DDR scene as well.
2247771	2248091	Oh, okay.
2248932	2250993	Because, you know, DDR and Madden are so much alike.
2251994	2252455	Okay.
2253419	2254920	No, I'm teasing, but that's cool.
2255000	2260764	There's a tournament of Madden and Tuesday and Steve Space Pizza in the marketplace.
2260804	2266428	There's been kind of an over, I mean, I'm sorry, there's been a lack, actually, of really big tournaments lately.
2266448	2269290	In the past few months, big tournaments, there haven't been a whole lot.
2269651	2273754	But I kind of fear that this December is looking to be almost a little oversaturated.
2274034	2278457	I've heard of a lot of different things going on, so just be careful, check out the calendar.
2279361	2285286	We all know everybody has an eye on DDR Freaks Tournament Forum, so just check them out.
2285406	2291211	Well, then you've got SVGL3, you've got B3 Part 2, I'm not sure when the hell that's going to turn out.
2292252	2296176	Oh, okay, or FU2 next year.
2298057	2298277	FU2!
2298337	2298878	FU2, buddy!
2301000	2301300	All right.
2302165	2304186	The Sacktown Smackdown, that's the subtitle.
2304566	2305227	Oh, Jesus.
2305567	2306307	All right, all right.
2307248	2309109	Anyway, anything else you wanted to share about your weekday day?
2310650	2314332	Except someone threw a damn beer bottle at my head.
2314352	2315652	For what?
2315712	2317373	I was like, whoo!
2318894	2319454	What'd you do?
2320175	2321696	No, I didn't say anything.
2321936	2322836	They thought I flicked them off.
2322856	2325358	I was like, hello.
2325378	2326638	You were waving at somebody?
2326918	2327539	Hello!
2327559	2329580	And they threw a beer bottle at you?
2329600	2331401	I was like, oh, shit.
2333634	2334934	My god, people can be rude.
2336875	2341496	Wait a second, he was driving and someone threw a beer bottle at him.
2341996	2343436	What's wrong with this picture?
2343456	2347177	I was like, woohoo!
2347197	2349317	But then, oh shit!
2353258	2354938	You lead a very interesting life.
2355378	2356418	Explosive, that's all I have to say.
2357198	2357498	Alright.
2357679	2359899	Well, somewhat, yeah.
2360697	2361257	My Week and My Day
2391229	2392410	Anyway, I had a lot of fun.
2392790	2395052	And I actually played a game of DDR, believe it or not.
2395412	2399294	I played a game of Extreme, and this was my set on DDR Extreme, okay?
2399675	2406039	I played I Believe in Miracles and Make It Better from DDR First Mix.
2406359	2408201	And then I played another second mix song.
2408221	2409902	I think I played Let's Get Down or something.
2410262	2412824	I made it an all second mix and first mix night.
2412904	2413544	It was awesome.
2414345	2415726	I miss my old DDR mixes.
2416926	2417127	Anyway...
2419639	2427001	Also tonight, I don't know if you caught a glimpse of me on the webcam earlier, but I'm dressed in all black because I'm going out to a goth club after the show.
2428221	2428882	That should be fun.
2429382	2430042	You goth.
2431502	2432803	Yes, you know I'm so gothic.
2433043	2435183	That's so wrong.
2435203	2437524	This is pretty much what it's going to sound like at the goth club.
2437564	2440105	Oh, wow.
2440545	2441365	The lights.
2443145	2445186	I'm so tragic.
2447701	2450102	I need another clove of cigarettes.
2456486	2457246	I'm just teasing.
2457366	2462709	I'm just hoping that somebody I know is listening to that so he'll kick my ass when, you know, I go out later.
2462989	2463230	Anyway.
2464230	2468052	I didn't... I... Okay.
2470373	2471354	You know where I'm from.
2472034	2475396	And you know that damn near everybody I hung out with was like uber goth.
2475456	2475736	Right.
2476517	2476817	You know.
2477501	2480882	But I never imagined that there would be like a club.
2481302	2481723	What do you do?
2481763	2483183	Go around and just be depressed?
2483543	2488225	And wave your hands around like you're trying to bat the ghosts away from you?
2489426	2494227	I'm so gothic that when the night comes, so do I.
2496395	2504480	They fucking play industrial synth-pop, that kind of stuff.
2504520	2505441	It's really good stuff.
2505581	2507142	I actually like the music at that.
2507182	2521551	I went once, and then I got... I was with one of my friends who's in this goth stuff, and this one guy wanted to take me home and have sex, and he was dressed up in some sort of...
2524508	2525809	I don't know, it was just wrong.
2525889	2529130	And again, I don't know how many times I've had to apologize for that, Loki.
2529170	2535512	I'm sorry to do that to you, but... I just don't... If your life is so tragic, why would you dance about it?
2536172	2536853	You know what?
2537013	2537193	No.
2537353	2538813	In reality, it's actually a lot of fun.
2539814	2542955	If I didn't enjoy it, I wouldn't pay a whole $4 to get in the door.
2543055	2544596	So, I'm looking forward to it.
2544616	2546396	Because I actually haven't been in like two years.
2546576	2548497	And there's a lot of fun people to go.
2548537	2549337	It's all about the people.
2550578	2550878	Alright.
2552559	2553099	Moving on...
2553544	2555545	We're going to give you a little bit of help.
2583178	2594283	and Floatwalk has gotten a clue relayed to him from Dancer X, the mysterious Dancer X, but Floatwalk talks to him, so you're special.
2595343	2601345	And so we've gotten some things here, so maybe just these first two bits here we'll give away for right now.
2601826	2610069	Okay, well, it's pretty obvious so far no one has answered the question correct yet, although I will say I have seen some very close...
2611141	2611842	answers on there.
2611882	2620088	And as I mentioned before, a lot of people are trying to, I guess, sort of think that the song is three steps away from what you literally see.
2620328	2621529	Well, it's actually right there.
2621709	2623550	It's a little more literal than you think.
2623911	2632257	But also, if you read Dancer X's post, he said in there that it is a new song.
2632477	2634639	It's something that has never been on DDR before.
2635179	2638762	So that should narrow down some of the ideas that you had.
2639722	2642544	and, uh, hmm, do you think we should go ahead and give them the new clue yet?
2643165	2644105	Uh, let's wait a little bit.
2644145	2646327	Let's see if that new song thing helps them out a little bit.
2646627	2653932	So it's a brand new song, and you guys, it was actually, in his original post, it was, like, the subject line, and you guys completely missed it.
2653972	2655833	But hey, you know, what can you do?
2656334	2657634	We can only hold your hand so far.
2658415	2663058	But, uh, if you have some guesses, uh, we'll be fielding guesses over private message a little later.
2663158	2665420	Don't just shout it out in the chat room, because we're not paying attention.
2666282	2668904	No, actually, we are paying attention, but we don't want to miss it.
2668964	2671026	So that's why we like to field the guesses over private message.
2671426	2674369	So after the break, we'll take some more guesses.
2674709	2676610	And I'll even put it like this.
2677011	2681234	If someone can guess it just from the clues that I've given you, if you somehow pull it out.
2681977	2683958	I will guarantee you some cool Konami swag.
2684258	2685799	Ooh, swag!
2686020	2686680	Speaking of swag.
2686700	2687180	Can I guess?
2688081	2691783	We have a huge announcement on swag coming up for Orange Lounge later.
2692063	2694405	You will not want to miss this one.
2694505	2696726	Floatwalk's going to talk to us about this.
2696746	2698527	This is very exciting news for Orange Lounge Radio.
2698827	2700969	Floatwalk's going to tell us all about it right after the break.
2701389	2704451	And on this break, we're going to have three songs that all have a central theme.
2704811	2705952	You try and figure out what it is.
2706032	2706512	We'll be back.
2709182	2711424	I'm gonna show you how to burn
2779882	2780283	and many more.
2830114	2831014	Thank you for watching!
2857578	2858699	Thanks for watching!
2881995	2883096	Thanks for watching!
2918353	2920397	I'm burning up for you
3025474	3031336	Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.
3035718	3037999	We are back, Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 110.
3038279	3044322	Okay, we told you before the break that the clue has something to do with a new song, so...
3045180	3046801	Here's your chance to give it another guess.
3047001	3050243	Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your guess.
3050543	3052524	If you get it right, you get to be the one to announce it.
3052764	3053684	Ooh la la.
3054084	3058307	And you could even do that over the Skype line if you have access to that, our Skype line.
3058367	3064089	Just go to www.orangeontrader.com, click on interact with us, and get the information about the Skype line.
3064129	3065450	So we're looking for your guesses.
3066230	3069052	Meanwhile, before we went to the break...
3072657	3076640	Floatwalk and I were teasing a little something that's coming up for Orange Lounge Radio.
3077500	3080162	And Floatwalk, why don't you tell us a little more about what's going on?
3080242	3082704	I thought we had a third mic somewhere we can get for Jamie.
3083825	3084085	Maybe?
3084526	3084826	Maybe not.
3084906	3085186	I don't know.
3086387	3086627	Anyway.
3089129	3090870	So what were we just talking about?
3091130	3092131	The giveaway that's coming up.
3092431	3093112	Oh, yes, yes.
3093252	3093492	Well...
3094053	3102297	Okay, as I've seen in Orange Lounge, I know there are a couple people that we hold in high regard in this realm of Bimani and such.
3102918	3105879	People who we'd like to sleep with is this list we have.
3105899	3106339	No, I'm kidding.
3106600	3122448	And atop that list, which I think holds true for quite a bunch of people, you know, figuratively and conceptually, or reality, we do have someone who has decided to donate us some swag, autographed swag no less,
3123121	3125902	and that person would be... Drumroll anyone?
3126422	3126722	Yeah.
3128703	3130503	Okay, we got clap on the clapper.
3130883	3131824	But that'll do.
3132564	3135244	And that person is... Akira Yamaoka.
3135585	3136405	Yes, indeed.
3141429	3147534	DDR Spot did the interview with Akira Yamaoka a couple of weeks ago when we posted it on DDR Spot.
3148215	3162948	He mentioned somewhere in the email that he would be willing to give out some swag to our listeners and to our readers at DDR Spot, and given the business relations between DDR Spot and Orange Lounge, I figured why not share the wealth with everybody, so...
3163610	3166351	We do have a handful of CDs to give away.
3166792	3175856	How we will do that, we are still determining right now, but you will have to listen to not just Orange Lounge Radio on Sunday nights, but I think there's a little more attention you'll have to be paying.
3176796	3183880	Yes, we're cooking up a scheme right now on how we're going to give away the CDs, but we are very excited to be working with DDR Spot on this exciting giveaway.
3185220	3188282	I know a lot of people out there want those CDs, so we're going to make it tough.
3188800	3189160	More staff?
3189180	3189480	More staff?
3220700	3223982	Who'd be sucker enough to help you guys out?
3224102	3226824	People who like something different.
3227024	3239732	I'll say this as far as DDR Spot, one thing I do like to pump up about us is the fact that any kind of Konami news that breaks from the US side of things, no one's going to beat us to the punch.
3240496	3243719	Half the people who are on Spotstaff work there.
3243939	3249383	Is that difficult, having to have a DDR fan site, yet at the same time you work for Konami?
3249703	3255107	If you wanted to blow the lid on the whole Ultramix 2 song list, the Extreme Unlocks and all that stuff, you could do it.
3255788	3256448	Oh yeah, we absolutely could.
3256468	3257889	I mean, you could get sued, but you could do it.
3258170	3261732	We could do it, but at the same time, there's movies that you geek up over.
3261812	3265335	You don't want someone to tell you how it ends, word for word, verbatim.
3265612	3266213	Yeah, you know what?
3266233	3268955	The boat sank and Darth is Luke's father.
3269095	3269556	Sorry, guys.
3270277	3270937	Yeah, essentially.
3270957	3274941	I mean, just working for a while, it's like... And Jesus does die.
3276062	3277323	At the end, they hang Jesus.
3278004	3283970	Yeah, I mean, I think the best way of putting it... Wow, Jesus dies and laughter ensued.
3285424	3289187	Sorry for the spoiler, guy, but Jesus does die at the end of that recent DVD release.
3289507	3289787	Oh, yeah.
3290088	3297173	But the thing about, I guess, working there, like, the first day, obviously, you're surprised just as anybody to find out, you know, this news.
3297233	3302938	But then, once you start playing something for 40 hours a week, the novelty dies out after the 15th hour.
3305459	3310944	But I think we've gotten to the point where it's something, I mean, it's something we've all done before.
3310984	3315127	It's pretty standard nature to understand the nature of the beast, how people are on boards.
3315441	3322169	I mean, obviously they're going to pester you for a clue here or there, but now that I work closer with the product managers and all the PR people,
3322577	3329020	I kind of know where my limits are and once those are drawn out, it's easy to hold on to those, stay within those boundaries.
3329320	3335423	So speaking of limits, any other hints about things we could look forward to?
3335583	3338685	I'm trying guys, I'm trying to get something out of them.
3339025	3345808	I will say for Ultramix 2, SP7 will be ready when Ultramix 2 ships.
3346028	3346348	Right on.
3346468	3350130	Yeah, we already know what it is and there's new stuff on there.
3350450	3351770	All right, good.
3351910	3354531	So you're not just getting run-of-the-mill things.
3356692	3359092	The Xbox Live is going to be pretty awesome.
3359112	3360472	It's going to be more robust this time.
3361513	3364173	You've probably heard, obviously, you can trade edits online.
3364213	3365434	You can download step data.
3366054	3367494	Have they made an official announcement?
3367514	3370975	You don't have to say one way or the other, but have they made an official announcement about being able to play those edits?
3371015	3373256	I know there was a little bit of confusion about being able to play edits.
3374956	3377017	To, like, challenge someone online with the edits?
3377057	3377777	Yeah, with playing edits.
3378437	3378617	Okay.
3379110	3380471	Quite honestly, I can't remember.
3380491	3383373	I mean, there's so many things that go into, you know, like... Alright, alright.
3383453	3383893	It's cool.
3384013	3384754	It just slips me.
3384814	3385554	It's cool, it's cool.
3385795	3386055	Yeah.
3386755	3389477	I don't want you to say anything that's going to get you in trouble, so don't worry about it.
3389517	3390658	What else are things to expect?
3391078	3393960	A lot of people geeked up over DDR Extreme having a VRare.
3394821	3400585	I will say there is a high chance, not 100% sure, but there's a high chance we'll have a VRare number 4.
3402086	3402286	Ooh!
3402606	3402967	Okay.
3403047	3403867	You heard that here first.
3405228	3406489	A VRare number 4?
3406589	3406969	Possibly.
3407350	3407850	How would that
3408368	3409169	Okay, alright.
3409909	3411450	I think I see where this might be going.
3411530	3411810	Alright.
3412091	3413792	We'll leave it to our listeners to figure that one out.
3414432	3414833	Maybe.
3415213	3415573	Maybe.
3416674	3416934	Alright.
3417675	3423058	But other than that, I mean, Ultimix 2 is looking snazzy right now.
3423098	3429343	We're almost ready to send it off to Microsoft and just let them give us the good word.
3429903	3434887	Now, I don't know if you can repeat any of this, but you were telling me some funny stories about working with Microsoft earlier.
3434907	3436788	I don't know if that's something you've got to keep on the down-low or...
3438019	3439601	No, actually, it's kind of fascinating.
3439661	3447251	I mean, anyone who works in video games and does stuff with, like, Microsoft or Sony, there's actually standards you have to follow.
3447672	3456223	Like, funny thing is, things on the PlayStation controller, for example, you know those little analog sticks you have on the sides, you know, in the front of the controller?
3456584	3462527	They actually, like, anytime they're referred to in a game, they actually have to be called right analog stick or left analog stick.
3462567	3463647	You can't call them anything else.
3463987	3464968	Or you could call them L3, R3.
3465048	3470810	But if you say, like, yeah, in the instruction book, use the thumb stick, you would actually get zinged for it.
3471471	3472771	And what exactly is a zing?
3472791	3474912	Does that mean they come out and kick your ass or fine you?
3474932	3476473	They'll say, we're not going to ship your game.
3476553	3477873	Oh, my God.
3478634	3481295	There are some things they'll let slide, but there are some things they're pretty strict about.
3481515	3484776	And, like, just how you name your stuff is actually a big deal.
3484896	3485957	Well, not a big deal, but a semi.
3485977	3486097	Wow.
3487113	3487653	That's crazy.
3488113	3496137	Yeah, I mean, it's... When you work in QA and video games, there are things you have to test, like, you have to make sure your game can run 72 hours without crashing, you know?
3496517	3497157	Oh my gosh.
3497177	3499778	There are things you have to do, like, you have to pull the controller... Driver 3 passed that.
3500538	3502019	Yeah, how did Driver 3 get through QA?
3502039	3502819	That's what I want to know.
3502839	3504440	Yeah, you didn't go through Konami, that's for damn sure.
3504460	3505720	That's for damn sure.
3507341	3514704	But yeah, it's an interesting beast, just, I mean, a lot of people think when you're in QA you have to play games, you know, you just play it ad nauseum, but...
3515049	3518291	You really, you know, you're supposed to sit there and you're supposed to break what you can.
3518912	3524376	I mean, so anyone who's trying to get into the game industry, that's... You gotta learn how to break games, not how to play and break them.
3526077	3526938	Wow, that's good.
3527038	3529059	Yeah, Loki's very good at breaking games, I must say.
3529620	3531261	And I broke Ultramix last night.
3531281	3542349	I don't know, I was telling you this earlier, I actually broke Ultramix, so... Something got through the cracks somehow, I don't know, but... Well, Ultramix was a half-rush job, but I mean...
3542884	3549008	Like any other game in the series, the first will always have flaws, which is why you come out with the sequel to correct.
3549128	3550469	It honestly wasn't a big deal.
3550529	3552010	I found it more amusing than anything else.
3552070	3553290	It didn't piss me off or anything.
3553671	3556572	Besides, flaws in Microsoft products is nothing new.
3560135	3561155	Service Pack 2, anybody?
3565898	3567059	What else?
3567179	3571802	Most people know that a lot of the step data for new songs has been done by
3572301	3581188	Konami QA, I think people who, there's, you know, usually two people, people who like fun songs and people who like challenging songs, I think they're going to get a good variety of both.
3581789	3583510	I'm very excited about Ultramix too.
3583830	3588594	But something we haven't talked a whole lot about, DDR Extreme, it's just about out, it's almost there.
3588934	3599803	I gotta say, because we were talking about this last week, we were kind of like talking about the whole GameStop leaking the song list, some of the song list unlocks early and stuff, we were like, boy, Konami must be really pissed off at what happened.
3600620	3605341	Was there a little bit of frustration from the clue givers and things like that about the GameStop article?
3606522	3607642	Kind of, sort of, yeah, actually.
3607762	3610763	I mean, you know, I was talking to Jason... I'm sorry, not GameStop, GamePro, my bad.
3610863	3611383	My bad.
3611803	3623247	Yeah, Jason Needles was actually kind of, I wouldn't say mad, but he was definitely surprised that they would just blow out a whole bunch of screen caps that more or less gave away a lot of the secrets.
3623496	3632340	And I don't think necessarily it was intentional, it was just kind of like somebody just wasn't thinking, they were just grabbing screenshots and not thinking about, oh, maybe somebody's trying to keep the unlocked stuff a secret.
3632660	3642744	Yeah, well, I mean, I actually saw, like, what a press kit, you know, there's essentially different types of versions you get of a game, like, for example, they got what's called a media version, kind of like when a
3643488	3644288	I don't know anything about that.
3673211	3681274	Now, I would think stuff like You're Not Here and Maximizer and stuff, you guys were probably trying to keep under the lid a little bit, and then it just kind of got blown out.
3681294	3695759	I mean, You're Not Here was a little bit spoiled by the Dancing Stage Fever fusion song list, so it was kind of like, you know, there's a good chance that people were kind of thinking, okay, yeah, that probably would be an unlock, but Maximizer, that was
3696969	3707013	Even though you can go back to the whole reading the master song list thing and Maximizer had turned up there before, this is really the concrete confirmation people were looking for.
3707433	3708594	Yes, it's on there.
3708914	3714496	It's basically, to put it, it's America's own version of Max.
3716317	3717857	I don't know whether to be excited or scared.
3717917	3718297	No, I'm kidding.
3718317	3722239	I actually, I mean, a lot of people look at that and they say, oh, it's an 8-footer.
3722279	3723840	Gosh, you know, that's like a big letdown.
3723900	3724680	But I...
3725322	3733083	There was a guy who, you know, Pac-1 Kenobi, who's pretty well known in the DDR community, you know, on DDR Freak, and he was not able to full combo that.
3733643	3740665	I have to say, I am actually glad it's not a 10-footer, because honestly, I can't play 10-footers at home.
3740785	3745365	I mean, I can barely play them in the arcade as it is, but home versions aren't meant to be 10-footers.
3745565	3746085	Yeah, exactly.
3746125	3749946	I mean, you're playing on those freaking ignition pads, you know?
3751246	3752026	Yeah, that's true.
3752106	3754747	But I will say, Maximizer really sounds cool.
3754867	3755127	I think
3755757	3756798	Gaba, Gaba, Gaba, Gaba, Gaba
3785973	3788094	LankyStyles here with Rice Princess
3814028	3821336	Yeah, I just want to know, Mel B, how do you stay so sexy?
3821476	3826841	I'd say I do about 50 push-ups a day and one pack of pork rinds.
3829264	3829604	Awesome.
3830748	3839012	I guess I'll open up the Skype line in a little bit for those folks that may have a question or something about Ultramix 2 or DDR Extreme.
3839032	3840753	I swear I will hang up on you if it's something else.
3841473	3842074	So let's see.
3842174	3844775	We'll go to Skype line and see if anybody has anything they want to say.
3844795	3847296	Oh, I just missed that call.
3847336	3847637	My bad.
3847937	3849017	We'll see if anybody calls back.
3849718	3850458	Over on the Skype line.
3852359	3854560	You are on Orange Launch Radio.
3856741	3857021	Hello.
3857041	3857922	Hello.
3857942	3858062	Hello.
3859252	3860414	We cannot hear you.
3860474	3862756	Can you turn up your microphone volume or something?
3864819	3865380	Is this better?
3866040	3866882	A little bit.
3866922	3867622	Is this better now?
3867883	3868544	A little bit.
3868744	3869325	How you doing?
3870866	3873590	Alright, I missed all the Ultramix 2 thing.
3873610	3874331	Can you fill me in?
3876497	3878099	You missed everything on Ultramix 2?
3878899	3884104	Well, I only managed to pick up the other half, but I got cut.
3885385	3887788	Shame on you for being tardy to the show.
3887968	3888989	Shame on you.
3889549	3891871	I had to clean up my room.
3891971	3893813	You could clean your room while listening to the show.
3894093	3894994	I don't buy that excuse.
3897777	3899018	It's going to be on a disc.
3899568	3901470	Ultramix 2, Xbox.
3901730	3903572	The Xbox Live portion is going to be bigger.
3903852	3907816	There's a clue still involving the bagel out there, and it's for a new song.
3908276	3912039	And Ultramix 2 is going to have a variety of different kinds of music.
3912820	3913401	And what else?
3913861	3917044	Folks that are into DDR are doing the steps.
3917224	3917865	We know that much.
3918045	3920287	And there's going to be a mix of challenging versus fun.
3921848	3925732	Who are these people that are actually doing... Are these people well-known?
3926334	3929135	Can we give any more information about the people doing the steps?
3929195	3930155	I guess not, really.
3931656	3932276	Can we give names?
3932316	3933116	I don't think we can give names.
3933136	3941799	I can't necessarily name, drop, I mean, I'm sure I could, it wouldn't make a hell of a difference, but that said, the people who are in QA are actually... Wait, we can't hear you, Zach, let Mel finish.
3942479	3949641	They are accomplished DDR players, there are people who have won tournaments, there are people who, you know, not only PA'd, there are people who freestyle, so...
3950066	3957975	They take into account, like, you know, for basic steps, for example, you often want steps that are, you know, pretty easy and, like, freestylable, so we take that into account.
3958275	3967145	We take into account that, you know, for maniac steps, there are people who are total difficulty whores, and, you know, we do stuff that is ergonomically, you know, doable.
3967745	3971930	I mean, we're not going to do something that's, like, we strive for 11 feet, you know, because...
3972418	3975079	There are such things you need to have as game balancing and such.
3975319	3979541	Like I said, we're trying to find moderation, you know, balance.
3979822	3981782	In other words, Zaku, just go pre-order it tomorrow.
3982303	3982823	Word.
3983003	3983903	Yeah, one more thing.
3984004	3989686	Have you only focused on one half of the country, or is it all over for these players?
3991367	3993728	Certain players, is it only one part of the country?
3993748	3995369	In other words, are all these players coming from NorCal?
3995785	3998387	Well, let's put it like this.
3999468	4006733	It's based in Redwood City, so it's not like we just sat out there and we had this big audition.
4006993	4011356	Anyone could apply to Konami, but they had to go through the whole interview process.
4011376	4019482	They had to go through people like me who have worked there for a year, and I have to gauge their acumen on how well they play the game, what they think makes the game well.
4020528	4027033	Most of us are based in Northern California, but there are some people who have been imported.
4031917	4034559	Imported from different places, that's all we can tell you, bud.
4036861	4038162	Anything new about that?
4038302	4041044	Anything that we know about the song list is already up on the site.
4041144	4042565	We don't have any new info tonight, though.
4043026	4043406	Not yet.
4043526	4045087	We may have one more song before the night's over.
4045988	4046608	It's up to you guys.
4046669	4048430	Are the song packs going to be better?
4049028	4050469	Are the song packs going to be better?
4051550	4053171	That's an opinion.
4053292	4057735	I mean, like I mentioned about SP7, there is new stuff on there.
4058156	4059116	I'll answer it, yes.
4060518	4063000	Wait, the new song pack for Ultramix is coming out already?
4064301	4067003	Service Pack 7 will be out the day that Ultramix 2 is out.
4067904	4071266	Do we have the names of the songs yet?
4071947	4072387	Not yet.
4072808	4073268	Not yet, bud.
4073288	4073949	We'll have them soon.
4075090	4076371	Alright, thanks for your questions.
4076791	4077892	It was engaging and fun.
4078958	4079319	Bye-bye.
4080820	4081200	All right.
4081640	4083261	Let's see if anybody else wants to call in.
4084042	4086524	Questions about Ultramix 2 or DDR Extreme.
4086544	4091708	In the meantime, let's go over some of these clues.
4091768	4097412	We got some people that guessed some of the songs that were in the game, and now we're going to let you know if anybody was right.
4098713	4099413	So let's see.
4099534	4104457	We had Sigurd put in a guess, but unfortunately he's not allowed to participate because he was right.
4104978	4105338	Woo-hoo!
4106645	4109449	But I will say Sigurd was right on his guess.
4109650	4110050	Good for him.
4111192	4112434	He better be right, man.
4113295	4117462	Jazz said the sweetest thing by some band whose name I have no idea.
4117562	4118243	I'm thinking maybe U2.
4119225	4120547	Now he's thinking too abstract.
4120947	4121068	No.
4121848	4123029	That was a decent guess, though.
4123250	4123870	That was decent.
4123950	4124571	Oh, I liked it.
4124671	4130115	I think that's the one thing I like about this whole thread thing, is you really get to see how people think.
4130636	4135420	It's like, they'll come up with the strangest word associations, and they'll try to go three steps.
4135680	4137882	Because of this and this and this, I think it's this song.
4138222	4141525	I mean, it makes for great reading material and sure kills time at work.
4141825	4142205	All right.
4142906	4143887	White Rob has a guess.
4144287	4147530	Pam Baker and the Blue Plate Special with Bake in the Blues.
4149045	4150326	Very interesting.
4151147	4154030	He says, the plate was blue and the bagel was baked.
4155251	4156472	You can't get more obvious than that.
4157233	4158374	But unfortunately, it's not it.
4158534	4158794	Yeah.
4159495	4159875	No dice.
4160095	4162878	Bummer.
4163919	4164159	E.B.
4164219	4166681	Sumaru says, John Desire with Hot Limit.
4167963	4169084	Maybe because the bagel's hot?
4169224	4169764	I don't know.
4170145	4172587	But... Nah.
4172787	4173167	I don't know.
4174128	4174589	Sorry, bud.
4174649	4174989	Doesn't work.
4176550	4181473	All right, so those are the guesses we got so far, so we'll just have to see if anything else comes in later.
4182274	4189459	Mel was talking about a V-Rare that is coming out for DDR Extreme, and that song list was leaked to the internet this week.
4189479	4192180	It sounds like some retailers are getting their copies.
4192461	4194862	There was a scan of the back cover and everything.
4195483	4198204	It's out there now, so we got to tell you what's on it.
4198705	4199285	Well, damn.
4200786	4204789	Here's another one of those things where they beat you to it, didn't they?
4205342	4206823	Well, there's only so much you can do.
4207584	4212368	We held up our end of the bargain, but we can't handle what the retailers do.
4212629	4213990	Yeah, the retailers leaked it.
4214170	4217013	If people like the VRare list, then, you know, hey, all is good in the end.
4218154	4222758	Track number one is Scorching Moon by Sean the Horny Master, which did not get censored.
4222798	4226301	People thought it would be censored to just the master or... What's to censor?
4226401	4227622	The dude plays horns.
4228743	4229304	Exactly.
4230054	4231315	I mean, not anymore, you know.
4232736	4236498	I still have a little sadness in my heart for the fact Shoti's no longer in Konami.
4240060	4244983	Number 2, A by DJ Amuro is the second track on the CD.
4245743	4248285	Track number 3 is Ecstasy by D-Complex.
4248445	4250666	Track number 4 is Your Rain, the Rage Mix.
4251247	4255429	Akira Yamoka featuring Mary Elizabeth McGlynn, the track we premiered for you last month.
4256273	4258474	Wild Rush, Factor X, is track number five.
4258755	4262497	Track number six is The Departed, Show T with A Stupid Barber.
4263137	4265819	Track seven, Mobile Moga by our favorite, Orange Lounge.
4266219	4270261	Track number eight, Jet World by Muchiko Izumi.
4270642	4270962	I'm white.
4271322	4274124	And track nine, 321 Stars by DJ Simon.
4274464	4277906	Track ten, V for Extreme by DJ Taka.
4278658	4279859	And here are the bonus tracks.
4280439	4283941	Eleven is I Need You, the Inside Door 3 mixes.
4284041	4285181	I've never heard of that one before.
4285481	4289984	Um, actually, that was, uh, yeah, Party Collection VRare also.
4290324	4292285	No, actually, they're one of the VRares that came out in Japan.
4292305	4296447	Yeah, it's like, it has all three mixes, like, all kind of used together.
4296467	4297107	That's kind of neat.
4297127	4298448	No, it's just the Inside Door 3.
4302250	4302590	All right.
4303231	4303591	Oh, okay.
4303811	4304131	All right.
4304291	4305972	It's Supafova does that one.
4306052	4310854	Drop the Bomb, the original extended mix by Scotty D. Should be an interesting track.
4312715	4312935	Is it?
4313175	4313996	On the Party Collection OST?
4314076	4316857	I didn't know that.
4316997	4318698	13 is Be For You, Glorious Style.
4318718	4320879	That would be the long version from DDR5th Mix.
4321159	4322440	You guys trying to hint at something there?
4322880	4323140	Maybe?
4323440	4323740	Maybe.
4324020	4324501	Maybe not.
4325641	4331424	Track 14 is So In Love, the train version by Caramel S and The Master.
4333294	4337798	and track number 15 is I Need You, the true platinum mix by Show-T.
4339119	4340160	And that's the V-Rare.
4340320	4340480	Yeah.
4340780	4354731	Actually, while it's still on my mind, one thing I'd like to point out also for anyone who's fans of Konami artists and, like, the B-Mani musicians, one of the games that's coming out this fall, Rumble Roses for PS2, the all-female wrestling game.
4355412	4357373	You know, two of the best things ever made.
4357393	4357994	Hot!
4358948	4364532	A lot of the B-Money musicians did compose music for that, like DJ Taka did a track there.
4366894	4369095	Sota Fujimori did stuff there.
4370116	4371217	Yeah, let's see, who else?
4371497	4376621	The guy who did, freak, I can't remember his name, but the guy who did Jet World, he did something.
4377281	4378822	Dez Rowe did a track on there.
4379303	4387949	So yeah, I mean, it's actually funny enough, they were called at their commission somewhere at the last minute to do music for the game, and from what I've heard, it sounds pretty cool.
4389230	4389750	Nice.
4390070	4390730	I can't wait to see it.
4390770	4394031	So definitely, if you're a Bomani music fan, you're going to have to pick up Rumble Roses.
4394412	4397572	But of course, as soon as we can get our hands on a soundtrack, we'll play some tracks for you.
4397592	4398173	How could I forget?
4398253	4400993	Akira Yamaoka did tracks on there as well.
4402154	4402574	Gosh.
4402814	4403574	Thank you, Sigurd.
4404875	4405215	Awesome.
4406715	4407155	All right.
4408316	4412437	The other night, a bunch of us were at Lions, and it was like Dan's GameStop people.
4413137	4416318	And they were there discussing on how they were looking forward to the...
4417031	4423776	Realistic Physics Engine of Rumble Roses and the Invigorating Mud Effects.
4424857	4426358	It was a funny conversation.
4426918	4432122	Yeah, talking about how they were going to admire the aesthetic qualities of Rumble Roses.
4432222	4436405	And yeah, we did talk about this a couple weeks ago, chat room, but I didn't know about the Desro thing.
4436425	4438807	There's more artists in there than we originally thought.
4438907	4441789	I knew Akira and I knew some of them, but I didn't know Desro.
4441809	4443170	There's way more people than I thought.
4443710	4444351	That's pretty cool.
4445262	4449323	Any chance we might see some Rumble Roses songs on DDR, complete with some new characters?
4451284	4452624	As I do my little bounce thing.
4453325	4455565	Alright.
4455625	4457806	Question from Explicit, here in the house.
4458126	4460467	How many polygons are in each breast in Rumble Roses?
4462287	4466329	More than a handful.
4466589	4470050	On that note, I think we'll go to a break.
4470598	4477481	and to make up for Floatwalk's grotesque error earlier, we will be playing an entire block of Akira Yamaoka music.
4478942	4480183	All right, including some requests.
4480203	4480843	We had some requests.
4480883	4482224	So we will go to this.
4483204	4483464	You know what?
4483484	4484585	Do you want to do that other clue?
4485565	4486946	Should we do the other clue, Floatwalk?
4488327	4488747	Why not?
4488807	4491248	Hell, Floatwalk, let's give him another chance.
4493319	4495741	Clue, colon, a unique aspect of a type of cells in the body.
4495761	4497923	So, uh, those of you who took physiology in high school...
4521008	4525952	Time to dust off your books and your brains and you just might find something.
4526272	4527293	Have fun, boys and girls.
4527353	4527873	We'll be back.
4530815	4533497	You touched my body once.
4533597	4534778	It burned.
4602568	4603651	Thanks for watching!
4632512	4635574	Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
4663522	4664924	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4685871	4689314	Amagi Novoleo Amagi Novoleo Amagi Novoleo
4860891	4862132	Orange Lounge Radio.
4862472	4864634	We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.
4869898	4870478	We are back.
4870558	4878424	Orange Lounge Radio Season 5 has just started, and in case you missed it, a unique aspect of a type of cells in the body.
4879064	4880905	It's time to guess one more time.
4880985	4885969	Send it in over private message to Sky in the chat room if you have a guess.
4886653	4890575	DarkSakura, you can't participate tonight because you drove.
4890615	4892856	So... You got a mic right next to you, hon.
4892876	4893276	Other side.
4893316	4893957	There you go.
4893997	4895938	Well, you know, normally I would have, like, one thing.
4895998	4896598	I don't know.
4896978	4898579	I'm trying to be good today, but sort of not.
4898599	4900200	Because if I were going to be bad...
4916061	4918482	I'd be breaking into the pizza and then having a few shots.
4920062	4924383	But because I ate the whole thing of ice cream today.
4925324	4927444	I wanted ice cream so bad all week.
4927804	4929725	I wanted ice cream more than I wanted booze.
4929765	4933446	So what I'm going to do... Imagine if they made ice cream booze.
4934206	4935067	Oh my God.
4935767	4941428	I've actually sort of... I had this creme brulee liqueur that was really good.
4941928	4943609	So I've decided how to cheat.
4945106	4947248	I decided that tomorrow was going to be my cheat day.
4947308	4949389	So when it hits midnight, I'm having some Guinness at home.
4949590	4950170	There you go.
4950350	4950951	That's the spirit.
4950991	4953472	I'm going to finish off the Guinness in my fridge and have some Amaretto.
4953673	4954073	All right.
4954253	4955474	Any special plans for Labor Day?
4957756	4958296	Sleeping.
4960878	4961359	Sounds good to me.
4961479	4964041	Actually, no, I'm going to do my homework tomorrow.
4964061	4966202	I'm going over to Julie's where there's air conditioning.
4966663	4967603	Air conditioning, wow.
4968244	4969985	And I'm going to do my laundry.
4970005	4973148	Because see, look what I did not bring over tonight.
4973328	4973648	Laundry.
4973668	4974429	Was my laundry.
4974489	4974929	Impressive.
4975609	4979912	So I'm doing my laundry at Julie's tomorrow and making use of one of her five computers that she built.
4981373	4981893	Sounds good.
4983434	4983975	Yes, Loki.
4984915	4985055	No.
4986116	4986336	Okay.
4988357	4991019	No, I'm actually working on right now building my own laptop.
4991820	4994021	Like, actually, it's not really a laptop.
4994481	5004168	I'm going to be putting it inside of a case of a Dreamcast, and it's going to be a portable PC with its own LCD monitor, which will also double as a car PC with its own navigational and GPS system.
5004921	5007242	and will be an on-road computer for our show.
5007762	5010243	Well, you know the Dreamcast uses Windows CE.
5010744	5012244	Well, I'm actually gutting it.
5012264	5013185	I'm just using the case.
5013565	5015126	Like the Nintendo PC?
5015606	5017987	Something like that.
5018087	5025851	I wanted to use a Nano ITX motherboard, but they're not available yet, so I'm going to have to use a Micro ITX board.
5025891	5027791	Why not build one out of a PS2?
5029853	5032375	Well, because... Because you can find plenty of broken PS2s.
5032515	5034476	Well, Dreamcast is small.
5034796	5039019	I wanted to use an old PS1 because they sell for $30 on the internet.
5039039	5039820	I could give you one.
5040140	5043142	Well, a PS1, but the board's too big for it.
5043202	5045804	If I had a Nano ITX one, it would fit perfect.
5046505	5048386	But as it is, I don't know.
5048486	5050727	I'm just pricing it because it's kind of expensive.
5050747	5052889	The Nintendo one was built out of laptop parts.
5053320	5054682	Yeah, that's what I'm going to do.
5054722	5057305	Laptop, hard drive, LCD monitor.
5057325	5062311	I'm actually going to hack a portable PlayStation 1 LCD screen.
5062411	5064313	They have a Dreamcast mobile monitor, though.
5065214	5066516	I'll have to check that, too.
5066936	5070640	I think one of the ones on Lixang.
5070660	5071882	Lixang, I'll have to check them.
5072202	5073522	But anyways, yeah, that's what I'm going to work on.
5073542	5079985	It's going to be kind of cool because I want to, like, I was actually, what I was setting up for was mini-MAME or, like, mini-Bomani stuff.
5080125	5085586	So, like, making a micro turntable Beatmania type setup for, like, that kind of thing.
5085646	5088487	But the only problem is they're not very powerful PCs.
5088527	5091268	They only go up to, like, 1 gigahertz.
5091708	5095610	Because they're just, you know, they're mic, no fan or anything, but it's awesome.
5096470	5099791	They make the, like, they have, like, tiny fans now and heat sinks.
5100222	5100442	Yeah.
5100662	5101963	Anyways, that's the project I'm working on.
5102003	5102623	That sounds cool.
5103323	5105304	So you've given up on communicating with the dead?
5105324	5107805	Nope, have not.
5107825	5111786	I have my eight and a half pounds of magnet wire in my room.
5112467	5114987	And I have my germanium on my desk.
5116348	5124331	And I actually was looking at copper today, but they only have copper-plated circuit boards.
5124511	5126612	But that might be good enough just to stick on there.
5126672	5126972	You can...
5127899	5131021	Order copper from the science ordering places.
5131181	5133063	Well, I just need a copper plate, and it's small.
5133383	5133923	Copper plate?
5135492	5136192	I'll talk to you about that later.
5136212	5136873	I think I know where to do it.
5137173	5139534	But yeah, I'm just looking in the parts for that.
5139794	5149940	The only thing is I figured out that the guy's design is physically impossible because if you were to make something that strong in that small of space, it would literally melt.
5150600	5151941	It would just be gone.
5152081	5152621	So I don't know.
5152641	5154822	This dead would take it over and it'd open a portal to hell.
5154862	5155663	No, it wouldn't do that.
5156003	5159184	The only portal it'd open would be burning down the house.
5159364	5162146	And I just don't... It couldn't...
5163004	5171568	It couldn't maintain the structural integrity it needs to keep the portal to hell open, so it would just burn up from the flames of Hades.
5172409	5174210	But anyways, yeah, I'll do that later.
5174290	5179192	It would be hotter than a... I was pricing it today at Radio Shack, but I don't like Radio Shack because they're too expensive.
5188337	5189117	Okay, anyways.
5189658	5190598	I'm going to go back to drinking.
5194614	5195695	Yes, you learned quickly.
5201679	5203240	I don't know, I'm in a sound effects mood today.
5204141	5207623	Anyway, let's go see if we got any guesses.
5207663	5209464	We actually only got one more guess.
5209785	5213327	It looks like some people, they want more time with this clue.
5213387	5218030	They want more time with the unique aspect of a type of cells in the body clue.
5218411	5220772	I'm wondering how it feels to want.
5221213	5221473	Okay.
5221873	5227118	Well, we will give another chance for guesses if there's still... Some people want to Google it, so they're Googling away.
5227439	5228079	But we do have one guess.
5228099	5229741	You should have paid attention in school.
5229861	5230381	That's all right.
5230902	5233825	Chaos Dimension suggests a song, and I've never heard of this.
5234205	5238009	You Got Beef by Chucky Akins and V-Unit.
5239150	5239450	Rob.
5240431	5242193	Mel's saying no, no, no.
5243894	5244134	Rob.
5244935	5245155	What?
5245536	5246697	Isn't it nice to want...
5247869	5249530	Isn't it nice to say something Jamie just said?
5249730	5251951	Yeah, I just sort of said that.
5253871	5254192	Rent!
5254832	5255212	Pay it!
5257893	5258273	Anyway.
5259694	5263295	Seegard got it right on the second guess as well as the first guess, amazingly enough.
5263355	5265796	He sent me another message and he got it right.
5265916	5266676	I was so amazed.
5267877	5273099	If you got it right on the second guess, that's kind of like saying he battled himself in a race and he came in third place.
5275800	5276220	Beautiful.
5278220	5278700	Beautiful people.
5278720	5280021	That means his ass came in last.
5282963	5289527	Yeah, as somebody says in the chat room, as I recall, you got beef is not a unique aspect of a type of self in the body.
5290128	5292769	Maybe, well, you know, if you... We got the beef self.
5293029	5295771	If you call yourself maybe a beefy built guy, I don't know.
5295931	5297592	Anyway, moving on.
5298313	5298953	Where'd Loki go?
5299053	5299954	Did he disappear into the bathroom?
5299974	5300574	Seriously.
5300594	5301175	I want to talk to him.
5302515	5304897	Just, like, pay attention in school.
5306650	5308532	See, people don't like to be made to think.
5309513	5310154	That's alright.
5310955	5311455	It is hard.
5311515	5312236	It is a hard clue.
5312396	5313097	There are hard clues.
5313117	5314579	This is why it's taking you so long to get it.
5314839	5316521	Nobody likes to be made to think.
5317522	5318844	Because nobody thinks anymore.
5319745	5320946	Chatroom, prove me wrong.
5323549	5324350	Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.
5324410	5324670	Anyway.
5325111	5325832	See what I mean?
5326412	5326993	Moving on.
5328824	5332125	You guys know about the big day of November 18th coming up.
5332145	5339926	18 November, as some folks have been referring to it, where we get a whole shitload of new releases from Japan, including Poppin' Music 10.
5340206	5342527	And there is a brand new website open for Poppin' Music 10.
5343107	5349768	And it doesn't give us a whole lot about the game, but it does show us those cute little Kubricks that are coming with the limited edition.
5350388	5350788	So cute!
5350808	5351849	Okay, I need to get that.
5352269	5353989	Because I need Poppin' Music Kubricks.
5354264	5357245	There's some more information in our chat room, if you care.
5358166	5360687	Link to the website that has more information.
5361067	5370331	Also, 8th Style is going to be getting a limited edition with it, and apparently the limited edition comes with some kind of, what I thought was cool, not only do you get a little EMUs card, but you also get...
5372089	5373090	I was going to add a comment on 8thStyle.
5373110	5373170	Yes.
5373210	5375291	Actually, I got a report from DarkLionXVI this afternoon, a.k.a.
5375311	5378132	Siggy, that he was saying that the limited edition was going to be retailed at $130.
5378172	5378233	Yes.
5401360	5401680	You know what?
5401800	5405962	Oh, I wish Siggy was on Skype right now because I'd call him and make him tell us more information about the game.
5407242	5407763	He's on Skype.
5407783	5408983	I was going to say something, but no.
5409003	5410404	What do you mean, who cares?
5410584	5411344	I want to eat style.
5414045	5414725	I guess that's true.
5414745	5416426	Mel's saying, who cares what's in it?
5416706	5416806	It's $130.
5417847	5418167	Buy it.
5419848	5420568	What's the problem?
5420628	5421188	Just buy it.
5423349	5424129	And how?
5427871	5428171	All right.
5429687	5430968	Ziggy's not on Skype right now.
5431008	5432009	I'll try to call him later.
5432049	5436892	Maybe he can give us more information about what's going on with the... Because I haven't been paying close enough attention.
5437252	5439273	I'm getting confused enough at all the U.S.
5439473	5444557	news going around that I can't keep track of the Japanese news as well, so... Anyway.
5446458	5448559	Shall we have ourselves a cage match, boys and girls?
5448799	5449620	Let's do it!
5449880	5450540	Yay!
5450701	5452121	We's gonna have a cage match!
5455604	5457505	Last week in the Orange Lounge cage match...
5458334	5459834	I need a quiet in the studio, please.
5459854	5461695	There's too much sidebar conversation going on.
5461735	5462595	We can't hear ourselves.
5463976	5464336	Thank you.
5466956	5474438	Last week in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, we had Bond 1, that was Jamie's pick, with a song called Shine.
5474899	5476919	And what was so special about Shine, Jamie?
5477019	5479200	It used some of the same samples from Afronova.
5479800	5479980	Yes.
5480322	5482844	So it has a little bit of a DDR tie into it, so we'll hear that.
5483205	5485126	But you only get to hear a clip of last week's winner.
5485447	5491652	As a reminder, the way the cage match works, we're going to play three songs for you guys, a clip of last week's winner, and two new songs.
5492253	5499579	And the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio, as chosen by your votes in the chat room.
5499980	5501661	So we will get to it.
5501701	5503263	Here's song number one you can vote for tonight.
5503523	5505585	But please remember, do not vote until I say so.
5506656	5509802	Song number one, Bond with Shine, the Dub Chakra mix.
5509822	5510603	Here's a clip, enjoy.
5646348	5647969	All right, that was last week's winner.
5648369	5651572	That was Bond with Shine, the dub Chakra Mix.
5651692	5652933	That song just makes me happy.
5653033	5657216	Will it win for two weeks in a row, or will it succumb to one of our challengers tonight?
5657276	5658156	Let's find out.
5658757	5662279	First challenger tonight is one of my picks, and you know what?
5662339	5668844	I have to admit, ever since I heard that Skulk was announced for Ultramix, I've been liking that band Echo Image more and more.
5669484	5696043	and not that Sigurd has anything to do with that by allowing me to borrow the CD for a little while but honestly, the more I listen to it, the more they remind me of Erasure and all these cool synth-bop bands I love and I gotta say, I love this song and I want to put it in tonight's cage match it's a song by Echo Image from their CD and the song is called Standing Alone it's track 2 from their album, I believe it's called Compufonic I'm going off the top of my head there so here it is
5696980	5698661	So if you like Skulk, you might like this.
5698962	5699282	I don't know.
5699302	5699662	We'll see.
5699702	5701584	This is Echo Image with Standing Alone.
5701644	5701964	Enjoy.
5811212	5826982	Black rain clouds sealing up the sun The shouting voices in your head Tell me nothing You scream but no one hear you calling You left without your life
5986421	5992604	Alright, as typical Orange Lounge fashion dictates, we'll go around and see what everyone thought of Echo Image with Standing Alone.
5993224	5996406	And not standing alone there in the corners, DarkSakura with her impression.
5996766	5999227	It freaking sounds like Depeche Mode, I like it.
5999887	6002729	So, that one gets a 9 for me.
6003689	6004169	Nice solid 9.
6004229	6005310	And it's not trance.
6006511	6007112	Mr. Floatwalk
6034760	6035840	It's pretty solid.
6035981	6037241	It's a smooth track.
6037261	6037781	That's what I like.
6037801	6044704	You know, you got all the keys to Cincinnati, but it's not overly, you know, like, it's just not very loud and over-imposing.
6045204	6048785	I just think it's something you can really relax to, and that's why I dig it a lot.
6048845	6050206	I think I'll give it a nine and a half.
6050726	6051946	Ooh, lanky style.
6053327	6053967	I like it, man.
6054027	6060309	So far, the two tracks I've heard from them have been really good, so I gotta listen to that CD sometimes, so I'm gonna give it a nine.
6060329	6061069	Good stuff.
6062310	6062810	Shark Scroll.
6063800	6067081	PrettyNine Angel
6093389	6094989	That sounds hot, as well as the rest of the TV.
6095009	6095789	So you know what?
6096470	6096730	Fat 10.
6097870	6099230	Ooh, another Fat 10.
6099770	6100310	Explicit.
6100330	6103991	This song gave me an orgasm.
6105891	6108452	I like this song a lot, though, so I'll give it a 9.5 out of 10.
6109512	6109892	All right.
6110872	6111392	Moving on.
6113113	6114473	Hi, how you doing, Heather?
6116053	6117453	I'm like, who the hell did the mic go to?
6118353	6121174	Loki's sister's here to give her impression of the song.
6123704	6124985	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6153926	6156867	I want more of these embarrassing Loki stories after Cage Match.
6158328	6163230	Fire Poker, it was one of those log, like, you know how they have those things to pick up logs?
6163250	6166551	It was a log grabber thing, you could move logs in a firebox.
6166571	6169952	We are so sending Loki out of the room after Cage Match, I want more of these stories.
6170213	6172854	Alright, anybody else?
6173354	6175415	Does Loki's girlfriend want to give a number to that song?
6176935	6178936	Anyway, what song?
6179753	6191282	Alright, next up is Loki's pick, and Loki has picked something very special for you guys tonight, very special, it's special.
6192242	6209015	Okay, now, I was gonna go with my remix, which, you know, that's just, you know, standard, because, you know, I make it, and so it's gotta be in there, but no, no, um, you know, my fiance had better plans, so she picked this song, I don't know who it's by, um, it's, uh,
6210184	6212566	Papa Smurf, Lick My Ass
6438342	6439343	The Chocolate Factory
6468098	6470519	A score of negative infinity from Jamie.
6470559	6471660	Let's hear from Loki.
6473281	6475542	I tell you, this is my fiance's pick.
6475602	6476523	I did it for her.
6476743	6477504	So it gets a 10.
6477544	6480925	This one's going to be Rob's song.
6481166	6482887	Rob was going to use this in another week.
6483187	6484908	So don't be getting pissed off at me.
6484948	6486048	This is all Rob.
6486409	6487309	It's all his fault.
6487609	6489671	He's acting all innocent, but it was all him.
6491271	6492892	Besides, the Flash video is much better.
6495154	6495534	Floatwalk.
6496744	6498606	Wow, I didn't even know PapaSwerve was black.
6500628	6505452	That said, yeah, that said, I got two words for it.
6505612	6505973	Solo 2005.
6506253	6509176	On a scale of one to ten?
6510437	6516282	Let's see, well, if we're talking booties, I think an eight kind of looks like a booty, you know, if you tilt it sideways.
6516342	6517784	So, yeah, I'm going to give it an eight.
6518104	6519145	All right.
6519265	6519825	You know what?
6520026	6522428	I was going to put that in the cage match, but...
6523052	6523552	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6553537	6555038	Uh, DDR Angel.
6555118	6557398	DDR Angel, what do you think?
6557818	6559999	Let's see, Comedial Factor 6.
6562240	6563040	Explicit.
6565481	6567962	Uh, no fucking comment.
6568342	6577845	Uh, I'll just give it a question mark, because it all depends on what people... Okay, I'll give it an 8, equal sign 3.
6577885	6579365	Alright, 8 equals 3 from Jonas.
6582877	6585919	Uh, LankyStyle, did you have a vote?
6587500	6593864	I think what I have to say is that Poppa Smurf should watch out because I'm sure she licked all the other Smurfs' asses before she got to him.
6596126	6597987	Yeah, I give it an 8.
6598587	6602650	I mean, it's a great song and all, but gag factor is basically all.
6602690	6603851	So, yeah, comedy, 10.
6604751	6605772	Song is a whole 8.
6607793	6610295	That song reminds me of a fanfic that my, uh,
6611064	6614125	Roommate from college had printed out on that.
6614145	6619406	You remember back in the days when printer paper was all green and white and had the tearing edges on the side?
6620026	6623867	Well, my friend went to the computer lab at my school.
6623907	6625647	This is in 1995, mind you.
6626467	6628328	Printed up the Smuck Fest.
6629388	6633629	Someone had written a Lemon fanfic about the Smurfs getting it on.
6634741	6635181	Gross.
6635221	6635942	It was scary.
6636222	6637944	And that's what that song makes me think of.
6638124	6640066	Let's wrap this up so we can get past this topic.
6640086	6640827	We've got one more.
6641107	6644350	Do you have an online name, Honda, I should refer to you as, or just Loki's sister?
6646612	6647293	Gypsy Wolf.
6647593	6649435	What would you give that, Gypsy Wolf?
6650015	6651116	I love that song.
6651337	6653419	Having seen the animation for it, I have to say a 10.
6654780	6655861	Oh, wow, a 10.
6656942	6657983	You're easy to please.
6658063	6659384	You gave two 10s tonight.
6659404	6660145	All right, that's all right.
6662186	6664027	Let's review so you guys can vote.
6664068	6664588	Here we go.
6664708	6669151	Song number one, last week's winner, Bond with Shine, the dub Chakra Mix.
6678038	6681721	Song number two is Echo Image with Standing Alone.
6690971	6694453	and song number three is Papa Smurf, Can I Lick Your Ass.
6702639	6706201	Alright, place, vote, now.
6706681	6710904	Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.
6712248	6716489	And we will tally up those votes very shortly and let you know who won tonight's cage match.
6716569	6718129	Let me, uh... Oh!
6718529	6721370	Jamie already beat me to the place vote now thing, so... Thank you, Jamie.
6723170	6726091	Moving on... You are welcome!
6726331	6728972	Moving on, let's, uh... Loki, why don't you give us a sim update?
6729012	6730052	What's going on in the sim world?
6730072	6733433	And I know you've built your own thing, and I know there's food mix news, all sorts of fun stuff.
6736653	6738474	Well... Uh... Ooh!
6738794	6738974	Done.
6739274	6739954	Okay, anyways, um...
6741064	6745406	No, there's another, I think... I can't remember if this was last week or this week.
6745966	6747566	There's another update to Techno Fiend.
6747666	6748347	It looks nice.
6748647	6749847	It's got some cool stuff in it.
6751688	6752488	What's Techno Fiend?
6752908	6755949	Techno Fiend is a... Excuse me.
6756610	6760211	Techno Fiend is a new Step Mania skin that's nice looking.
6760751	6763492	It's very... They do a lot of cool stuff to it.
6764472	6767694	Plus it has the Ridge Racer and Game Over thing, which is kind of cool too.
6768254	6768634	But, um...
6769793	6772934	They have, it looks nice, so that's what I have on the cabinet right now.
6773375	6778117	Now, it would have worked better had the cabinet, like, not broken itself, but anyways.
6778297	6784980	Other than that, it was just announced this week that Food Mix Plus had hidden content in it.
6786173	6790057	And now I have on our website how you can get to that hidden content.
6790097	6800786	Basically there is a dummy file in one of the directories there and you turn that into a zip file and you get a brand new song, new steps for some of the older songs, and new Oni courses.
6801267	6802448	So that's pretty cool.
6804690	6807272	And then other than that...
6807592	6808873	And that's really not that much else.
6808993	6818218	Oh, oh, no, no, it should be mentioned, the first pack of ripped characters from DDR5thMix has surfaced online.
6818258	6820960	You can find the link on DDRmaniaX for that one.
6821460	6822621	And they're pretty nice looking.
6822741	6829245	They're ripped directly from the DDR games because the guy that, he built his own software to do that kind of stuff, so that's kind of neat.
6830105	6855463	and, um, other than that, really, um, not too much else, uh, DDROSC3's going on right now, I think the first pack of songs has been released for that, um, and I know DDR, um, the remix contest on Bumai Style and, um, DDR Maniacs, I think, are up already, they're done, they should be posting those, uh, those songs online for voting soon, and I think that's all, yeah.
6857185	6857505	What?
6858339	6859821	You need a mic, because we're not going to hear you.
6861463	6864646	Have they added a comment section on Be My Install already for The Sims?
6865888	6866168	Um, yeah.
6866188	6867149	I think you could, that's new.
6867169	6867950	They already have that.
6868611	6870714	Yeah, because I just noticed about that.
6871274	6872376	Okay, but that's all that's going on.
6873557	6873797	So, yeah.
6877972	6880314	When a radio show calls out,
6906308	6908509	That means you're a shock jock and you're doing stupid bits.
6910249	6911650	Is your refrigerator running?
6913630	6914491	Oh, hey, Siggy, what's up?
6915491	6919452	I thought you were going to scat me after Cage Match.
6919592	6920593	Well, the Cage Match is done.
6920613	6921513	We're just waiting for the votes.
6922113	6922733	Oh, okay.
6922833	6923093	All right.
6923373	6932496	So tell me what you know about these new 8-style limited editions and stuff because I haven't really been following it because I can barely keep track of what's going on domestically, let alone importly.
6932576	6934437	So share what you know with us, would you?
6935083	6938865	Well, here's what I've known so far about 2DX 8-Style Special Edition.
6939745	6945188	They have, well, along with 8-Style, they have a 2DX Red e-amusement card.
6945288	6950690	It's going to be random, so we'll never know what's inside each art cover for that.
6952171	6954932	Yeah, they have a 2DX Visual Emotion DVD.
6955533	6956593	Oh, I can't wait for that DVD.
6957554	6957874	Yeah.
6959494	6959895	Let me see.
6960095	6961635	I'm reading the translation right now.
6962496	6964877	Yeah, they have the 8-Style V-Rare Soundtrack
6965822	6967504	Oh, an 8-style V-Rare, really?
6968024	6968285	Yeah.
6968665	6969986	Oh, that should be cool, okay.
6970487	6980896	And then the 8-style special edition, special made box, like a, you know, like a box for stacking your preview styles from, you know, from 5th, 6th, 7th, or whatever.
6981256	6981777	Very nice.
6982738	6985260	Yeah, and then, of course, here's still a little bit interesting.
6985721	6988503	It's a BeatMe2DX-style mail magazine.
6989724	6991606	Like M-A-I-L or M-A-L-E?
6993306	6994107	Okay, darn.
6997169	6997610	All right.
6998230	7000752	And with any other information on what's going to be on that magazine?
7001333	7001473	Huh.
7001493	7002113	We're losing you.
7002174	7003435	Speak into the mic a little more.
7003455	7004876	We're losing you.
7004896	7005296	Hmm.
7005717	7005997	D'oh.
7006037	7007258	Oh, well, maybe we can get a hookup.
7007278	7007518	Who knows?
7007538	7007718	Yeah.
7021243	7022404	Alright, well thanks for sharing that.
7022444	7023784	We were curious what was going on with that.
7025585	7030128	I checked on the Web Konami website for TJXHL.
7030148	7039033	The price is about 106,000 yen, which is, I think, or actually 10,479 yen, including tax.
7039233	7039693	Wow.
7040514	7042495	That sounds like a lot, but it's not quite that bad.
7042835	7046657	It's approximately $130, according to NTSX.com.
7047017	7047317	Alright.
7048038	7049058	Well, I'll be looking forward to it.
7049399	7050219	Thanks for the update, Siggy.
7051311	7051772	No problem.
7051972	7052753	Alright, take care bud.
7053353	7053594	Later.
7053934	7054174	Later.
7055335	7058178	That's also known as DarkLionXVI.
7058198	7060881	Some more information on 2DXA style.
7060921	7061361	Very cool.
7062723	7064264	Just to clear up something from our chat room.
7064604	7068208	Hey Orange Launch Radio, if I'm not correct, isn't this the first time you've ever called out?
7068408	7069189	Actually it is not.
7069642	7070543	No, we've called out before.
7100706	7107473	Oh yeah, like when people tell you, you know, are you getting cold, are you getting hot, I will say, someone in the room is pretty freaking hot.
7108715	7110477	Mmm, very interesting.
7110977	7111638	Yeah, I know I'm hot.
7111658	7113720	I'm not talking about myself either, but.
7114561	7115722	Some of us just can't help it.
7117584	7119106	Oh my, all right.
7120344	7122245	We're going to go to a break pretty soon.
7122305	7128986	I think we're just going to do a bunch of random songs in this next break, so we'll probably do that.
7133507	7136528	I've got to find those songs, though, so somebody has to help me fill time.
7136548	7137388	Who's going to help fill time?
7138048	7139489	Uh-oh.
7141669	7143710	I've had, how many shots now?
7144730	7149271	I think, well, I'm almost out of this glass, so that would be six shots, yeah.
7150899	7152700	I'm feeling okay, but a little dizzy.
7152900	7154060	A little slightly dizzy.
7157041	7157641	You know what?
7158461	7159401	Not really, actually.
7159421	7160502	I'm not feeling that warm.
7161302	7162702	If it were a cheat night, it would be on.
7163723	7169224	I need to sit down with someone with some either dark rum or tequila and just do shots.
7176746	7177186	Let's see.
7181218	7185939	Okay, other than that, let's see, what else can I talk about?
7186679	7187879	I should have brought my amaretto for you.
7189659	7192060	You know what, actually, where's Gypsy Wolf?
7192240	7193760	Because the chat room is reminding me of something.
7193840	7196741	Gypsy Wolf, we need embarrassing Loki stories.
7198441	7199341	Can we give you a couple minutes?
7199561	7200841	I suppose we can give you a couple minutes.
7200861	7201822	Alright, in the meantime, Loki.
7202742	7204322	We'll do embarrassing Loki stories after the break.
7204642	7206242	We do have to get into the FUs of the week soon, though.
7207502	7210483	Do you guys want to hear who won tonight's cage match, actually?
7212083	7212663	I guess.
7213204	7214244	We'll get to it in a minute.
7214524	7219207	But I will tell you that one song just like obliterated the competition.
7219527	7221107	It totally blew the competition out of the water.
7221147	7222188	Can you guess what song it is?
7224769	7226790	Which song would you guys think it is that obliterated the others?
7228351	7228971	Papa Smurf.
7228991	7229592	Papa Smurf.
7229612	7229992	Papa Smurf.
7230012	7230432	What do you think?
7231312	7234374	Because our listeners tend to go for the gross potty humor.
7235249	7239432	I mean, how else did Loki win a cage match by singing I'm Staying In?
7239952	7243094	Here is tonight's winner of the Orange Lounge cage match.
7248937	7250918	Chatroom, you have restored my faith in you.
7251158	7251779	All right.
7252479	7253200	Very nice.
7253320	7257542	An upset there by Echo Image winning tonight's cage match with Standing Alone.
7258723	7260504	I'm still getting my revenge next week.
7260564	7263025	About twice the votes that Bond got.
7263365	7264146	Papa Smurf
7264693	7267915	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7296007	7296527	Let's see.
7298807	7301788	I'm still trying to prep for the next break because there's songs I'm looking for.
7301808	7304289	A little random mix of songs I want to play for you, certainly.
7304949	7306530	I want to know who that one person was.
7306950	7307590	What one person?
7307910	7308891	The one person who voted.
7309211	7313312	I would share, but I'll let them reveal their identity in the chat room if they want to.
7313332	7320954	Oh, free... Mel says a free Max 2 be rare.
7320974	7322555	A Max 2 or an Extreme?
7322575	7322695	Max 2.
7323425	7324445	Oh, he only says Max, too.
7324465	7325946	I ain't that stupid.
7325966	7326926	I ain't that stupid.
7327207	7327807	How's it going?
7327847	7330488	Hey, I might have fallen for that, because I would have been all, ooh, V-Rare.
7330548	7333409	I'll just throw a giant papier-mâché V at them.
7334390	7334710	All right.
7335030	7335610	Sorry, guys.
7336110	7336510	Sorry, guys.
7336530	7340312	We can't take requests this break, because we have songs we really, really want to play for you guys.
7340832	7341813	And here we go.
7342213	7347695	We will be right back with more Orange Launch Radio and the FUs of the week coming up when we get back as well.
7347735	7348675	But please don't send those in yet.
7348695	7349356	And more clues?
7349556	7350036	More clues?
7350899	7354612	Maybe, but send in those guesses right now.
7355434	7356899	The clues never stop here on Orange Launch Radio.
7356919	7357281	We'll be back.
7430922	7431705	GF GF
7438317	7439178	Thank you for watching!
7468357	7469118	Thanks for watching!
7493190	7506573	I now sway, like they used to do, with a house beat to it, and before I'm through, you might learn a thing or two, you can show your piece, and you can catch me on Soul Train late next week, don't you know I'm all that, and a bucket of wings, I'm on the jabs, when I feel the need to shake my good thing, when you see me coming, sit back, relax, stay
7544323	7545124	Thanks for watching!
7607274	7622183	Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.
7630008	7631849	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
7632590	7632850	Logie.
7633820	7635581	Hallelujah, it's raining men.
7636961	7650306	Moving on, we are, speaking of things that have been coming over me, private message, we have some more guesses for the song that we've been trying to guess all night long.
7651427	7654308	Mel, it starts off with, I'm sorry, Float, it starts off with this one.
7655034	7656595	This is a good one from El Mullet.
7656655	7659896	The guess is Divine Sweet Divide by Tanya Donoli.
7659936	7660516	And this is why.
7660916	7663697	The jam on the bagel is sweet and cells divide.
7664397	7665358	Too abstract, sorry.
7665638	7666698	Yeah, a little bit too abstract.
7668078	7669459	Not a bad guess there.
7669759	7670939	I like the way you're thinking.
7671059	7672180	Yeah, I like the way you're thinking too.
7672900	7676441	John Fields says, Cytoplasm by WND Games.
7676541	7678342	Cytoplasm is unique in all cells.
7678462	7680323	In fact, it holds everything inside a cell.
7680583	7684104	And a cell always has a nucleus, which is round like a donut hole.
7685049	7685910	Sold!
7686610	7687071	Not quite.
7688792	7694777	Although probably right now with these guesses I'm probably relearning everything I forgot in physiology, man.
7696138	7697199	I sucked at biology.
7697540	7699541	Except, you know, when we talked about the reproductive system.
7699621	7700742	Oh yeah, I aced that sucker.
7702564	7704385	Alright, that's all the guesses so far.
7705126	7705746	That's all?
7706347	7707428	Yeah, that's it so far.
7707688	7708869	My goodness.
7711331	7712212	We'll see you a little later.
7713118	7714298	We'll open it up for more guesses.
7714318	7721079	Like I said, guys, I mentioned before the last music bed, someone in the room is very hot on its trail.
7721219	7725520	After that last batch, somebody else is just, like, smoking, honestly.
7725600	7728241	I mean, just thinking a little too far into it.
7728401	7729161	That's the only problem.
7730081	7732341	Can you honestly clue me into what we're talking about?
7733421	7733902	Shut up.
7736142	7736602	All right.
7738962	7739302	Let's see.
7739382	7741723	I think we should do the FUs of the week now.
7741743	7742303	What do you guys think?
7744676	7745376	Okay, we don't have to.
7745396	7748038	I mean, we can just sit here.
7748158	7749698	Damn it, I need to vent.
7749918	7750278	You know what?
7750319	7750779	No, I'm sorry.
7750819	7753280	Before we vent, though, where's Gypsy Wolf?
7753820	7756001	Because the chat room is begging for more Loki stories.
7756761	7758462	Loki, could you please leave the room for a minute?
7759242	7759783	Bye, Loki.
7760003	7760703	Yes, bye.
7761043	7761503	No, Loki.
7761824	7762284	Bye, Loki.
7762944	7764285	Nellie, can you take him to the bedroom?
7764305	7764885	No, what's the worst?
7764925	7766286	All he's going to do is object to things.
7766546	7767306	All right, all right, yeah.
7767546	7769007	He won't have a microphone, so it won't matter.
7769447	7773949	So, any funny childhood stories from Loki?
7774720	7777963	Okay, well, okay, anybody's familiar with Construx?
7778683	7781465	The building toys that you kind of snap together, they have those little blue things?
7781966	7782746	Whatever, okay.
7782986	7790972	Well, one thing that, you know, I used to do would be, this was also before I was, no, this was after I was born, but I was too young to remember most of it.
7791032	7792913	I saw pictures my mom showed me, so, anyway.
7793314	7797757	But you would build power suits out of the Construx and run around the house with them.
7799838	7801800	You know, shoot the dog, whatever was cool.
7802560	7806201	But, I don't know, I can't really remember all that.
7806481	7809782	Oh, the one that was the best thing, I love this, this wasn't embarrassing, this was just fun.
7810843	7813623	It was Mission Control with our dog.
7814644	7824707	And Matt would, Loki would sit there and he would, our dog, our Labrador, would walk around the house and do stuff, eat, drink, etc., her normal thing.
7825450	7829372	and he would say, Houston, we are taking in water and she would drink or whatever.
7829412	7839615	Basically, I would do the ground control at NASA's commentary on everything that my dog was doing as if it were some sort of spaceship or something.
7840056	7842417	It made people crack up like crazy and it was funny.
7843617	7847238	It was great when she was downloading cargo and taking a dump out back.
7847939	7848299	It was great.
7849682	7851564	Jettisoning, fuel, urinating, you know?
7851584	7852325	My dog is awesome.
7852525	7853406	Too bad she's dead.
7854207	7858131	Pets are cool, but, you know, I mean... That is so wrong.
7860053	7861094	What else do they used to do?
7861574	7863776	Oh, yeah, we have, like, um... What else was it?
7864637	7865318	I can't remember much.
7865518	7866919	I mean, we did a lot with Marbleworks.
7867500	7869542	Did a lot of crap with that, put water down them and shit.
7870563	7873446	We hit Army Men and Mom's Ficus Tree.
7874847	7876868	No, I remember now.
7876908	7883353	I have a water balloon launcher and I used to launch tennis balls at the people on the bike trail over the green belt from us.
7883833	7887275	It was cool because you can hit those people from 200 yards away.
7887755	7891678	And we got lucky one time and we hit a guy and he fell over and that was funny.
7892118	7892939	Yeah, that was that.
7892979	7898002	And then there was those little paratrooper guys you could do where you could get army men and strap parachutes to them on really windy days.
7898042	7899123	They'd fly right over the house.
7899443	7900344	You could watch them go.
7900804	7901464	Like, goodbye!
7901684	7903005	Melted quite a few army men too.
7903025	7903626	That was kind of cool.
7903646	7903726	Yeah.
7906172	7907113	How many poopy stories?
7907193	7909295	Did he ever shit himself or anything?
7909755	7912297	I ate dog food as a kid.
7912838	7914699	He ate a whole entire bowl of gravy train.
7914959	7916741	Gravy from ear to ear when he was a kid.
7916841	7918202	Dude, it had meat in it, okay?
7918282	7920303	If it's good enough for the dog, it's good enough for me.
7921264	7922025	Give me meat!
7923506	7924447	Dog's like, what the hell?
7924487	7925327	Where'd my food go?
7925888	7927469	Alright, well thank you for sharing those with us.
7927549	7933594	We needed some good embarrassing Loki stories, so... They weren't that bad, but they were still funny.
7933754	7934774	They were cute.
7934795	7935175	They were cute.
7936033	7939394	I killed a man with a trident through his chest.
7941894	7943494	It's from Anchorman, I'm sorry.
7944955	7945395	Right.
7946815	7947235	Okay.
7948475	7948695	Yes.
7949395	7949915	DarkSakura.
7949935	7950355	Nothing.
7950596	7950936	Alright.
7951516	7956757	Then I think it's... Do you have pictures?
7957177	7958197	They have pictures too.
7958257	7960277	It's in my photo album somewhere.
7960677	7961217	My baby photo album.
7961237	7962618	Is there a name we can call you, Alpo?
7964078	7964538	I think
7965891	7966091	L3?
7966171	7966311	No.
7998004	7999065	Rob, sorry.
7999625	8004589	I just had the worst idea ever, and no, this had nothing to do with Andrew, okay?
8005889	8007410	Next remix for Loki.
8009532	8012954	Long chain running, but he has to do something with dogs or something.
8014255	8016457	He probably needs to do a remix of Disco Dog.
8016917	8019639	Anyway, let's get into the FUs of the week.
8021440	8025523	Alright, Jamie, why do we have to do the FUs of the week every single week on this show?
8025543	8027104	Because we're full of to anger.
8035543	8041126	Oh, this is bad.
8042587	8053093	An F you to John Fields for making me laugh while I have a headache for shiny disco dog balls.
8053133	8056414	My first F you goes to the chat room for not guessing correctly.
8057035	8058215	And not enough of you guessing.
8058836	8060737	So, goddammit, guess.
8061537	8062298	And to...
8063191	8066473	Silent Ben for misspelling the word that you misspelled.
8068734	8072075	There's a site called dictionary.com.
8076978	8079279	Okay, there's one called hyperdictionary.com.
8080880	8081920	Just use it.
8082620	8083461	Learn how to spell.
8083581	8084261	Please, people.
8084301	8084982	And learn grammar.
8085502	8089444	And by the way, U is not spelled U. That is a letter.
8089564	8089804	It's Y-O-U.
8092449	8098451	Your is spelled Y-O-U apostrophe R-E or Y-O-U-R depending on the context you're using the word.
8098711	8099771	Not you are!
8101371	8101711	Okay?
8103212	8107473	Now if they put apostrophe U, apostrophe U, then that would be okay.
8108473	8109533	How would it be okay?
8110074	8119456	Because an apostrophe is for if you're shortening a word, so... But there are only certain allowed abbreviations of words that are grammatically correct.
8123706	8127787	that are commonly accepted by people who have been educated.
8128147	8128807	That doesn't matter.
8128827	8129688	Up to the third grade.
8129868	8130668	They're not educated.
8130688	8131088	We know that.
8133709	8139891	And normally, normally I've gotten a whole, but I've gotten off of my whole Grammar Fiend kick.
8140571	8143652	I got it, but I hit my saturation point sometimes.
8145292	8151754	So, uh... Anyway, uh... Anyway...
8153897	8161960	Another FU goes to the people on the road who are major assholes and don't know how to drive.
8163400	8166141	Amazingly enough, my drive here was without incident.
8167702	8176385	But a lot of my driving lately, especially to and from work, had been full of people who usually drive semis who don't know how to drive.
8178905	8179806	Semis are cool.
8180006	8183167	Okay, I hate the ones that are like the trucks full of gravel.
8184017	8185398	The gravel flies all the way out.
8185658	8188399	I have a crack in my windshield now because of the freaking rock truck.
8189260	8191080	It's like, you ass.
8191381	8194442	And it's going to cost like $300 if I wanted to replace my windshield.
8194462	8199805	I mean, it's so minor that I can live with the look, but it's there and right in the corner of my vision.
8200125	8201726	It's like, it's, there's, look.
8203306	8205107	My car is already raped.
8205447	8210230	And now I've got a crack, not a crack, but like, it's not a crack, it's a chip in the windshield is what it is.
8210450	8211410	And, oh, piss me off.
8212711	8212891	So,
8214875	8218677	So another FU goes to the hot.
8220078	8223219	I really dislike this part of living in Sacramento.
8223559	8226841	I love the winter because I like the rain a whole lot.
8227161	8229062	And I like that when I moved out here, it was raining.
8229142	8231103	And I was like, oh, it's just like Alabama, yay.
8232223	8237486	But anyway, it's just a pain in the ass.
8238947	8240327	You know, we think this is getting all cool.
8241128	8241868	And then it's hot.
8242568	8243509	So it's like, what's up with that?
8244145	8253492	Also, an FU goes to my apartment manager for me having told her weekly for the last month to fix my goddamn air conditioning and it's not fixed yet.
8254172	8260116	And again, with it getting into triple digit heat and not having a working air conditioner, that's like a health hazard.
8260456	8268522	You know in Arizona, if your apartment manager doesn't fix your air conditioning in your apartment, you can take them to court for it.
8270083	8271524	And I wouldn't be surprised if you could do it here.
8271544	8272705	This is fucked up.
8273180	8282244	and seriously here, I mean, I honestly would have grounds for negligence because there is a statute that's referred to as duty of utmost care.
8286586	8290448	And see, I know this because I'm taking business law right now, so don't fuck with me.
8292289	8301933	But no, it's especially like for hotels, for people who run facilities, there's a duty of utmost care to provide services to tenants, to guests,
8303226	8309411	You know, that they need to make sure that they provide a place that's going to be safe to live, safe to exist, you know, to operate in.
8309552	8311834	And this is not, you know, safe.
8312674	8318259	You know, when it gets up that hot and there's no way to keep cool, then that's dangerous.
8318299	8318940	It's getting bad.
8320681	8321702	Leave my foot alone.
8321722	8322983	Another FU goes toward...
8332347	8360215	American River College and this is why alright for anyone who's been paying attention to my live journal there's been the saga of my student loan check and see I work for my lender so I know where my money is I know when my funds have been dispersed I know how to do your job financial aid department at ARC I could do your job blindfolded so when I'm told that my check is mailed out last Friday
8361448	8364890	and it's, you know, I check the mail every day.
8365551	8367612	I'm not meaning last Friday as in two days ago.
8367672	8368853	I'm meaning the week before.
8370133	8374596	It does not take seven days to mail a check in town.
8375076	8376057	Okay, maybe two.
8378158	8379059	But not in Carmichael.
8380079	8386623	When ARC is six minutes from my house and the post office is six minutes from both ARC and my house.
8387944	8389505	No, this is just, it's,
8390356	8394098	So I'm going to call them on Tuesday and say, excuse me, bitches.
8395660	8400142	If my money isn't here within the next two business days... Give me my money!
8400603	8404325	Your asses are getting reported to the Department of Education and you know what they will do to you.
8404625	8405386	Bitch better have my money.
8405406	8406327	They will pull your funding.
8409329	8409429	Oh.
8412331	8413251	Okay, I vented.
8413291	8415112	That's like been my rage for the week.
8415152	8417314	Yeah, you forgot it was a three hour show here for a minute.
8417354	8417614	Yeah.
8418334	8418915	I just had a...
8419349	8421970	Big build-up of rage, and now I feel better.
8422590	8423070	You feel better?
8423510	8424330	Yeah, I feel better.
8424350	8424870	All right.
8424890	8426791	What do you have to say?
8427471	8429531	My foot says, get this thing away from me, bitch.
8429611	8429951	All right.
8430331	8431592	Ooh, he found the third mic.
8431672	8432012	Scary.
8432052	8432372	All right.
8432932	8436933	Moving on, let's go to Loki and Loki's FUs of the week.
8443594	8445095	Yeah, I'm starting to get a little dizzy.
8445275	8445675	That's cool.
8447600	8451541	Now, first FU goes to my stupid cabinet and the goddamn Ipac 2 for not working.
8451561	8461564	I don't even know why, because it works for like 2 seconds, or like, well, maybe a little longer, 2 seconds, but more like 30 seconds or like half a song in DDR, and then it just stops working for no reason, and I don't know why.
8461884	8468226	I thought it was conflicting with the Ipac 4 that I had in there, but no, that's not the case, because I unplugged the other one, and it still breaks.
8468306	8476489	So apparently, my shitty solder job that I did on it didn't work, so I need to, I don't know, get a new one, I guess.
8477406	8480347	Maybe it's because it shares the name with a crappy Macintosh computer.
8481327	8483848	Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot there's a Mac lever in here.
8484448	8485609	I'm going to go run and hide now.
8486149	8489470	I'm coming after you, and I'm going to clock you in with my iPod.
8489490	8495852	Fuck you to the new iMacs, because, well, you can make them look prettier, but they're still going to suck.
8497672	8499593	I said you can make them look prettier, but they're still going to suck.
8499613	8500473	Dude, what is this?
8500573	8502254	Like, crap on the Mac fan base?
8503228	8507752	Sorry, it's no fair to you because we happen to have a bunch of IBM freaks here.
8510037	8510457	You know what?
8510537	8512738	If I had $3,000, I'd love to buy an iPad.
8513578	8516278	What the hell is the i in the iMac and iPod?
8516579	8517619	What the hell is i mean?
8517719	8518539	Internet or something.
8518559	8518939	I don't know.
8520179	8522700	I don't know how to use computers, so I buy this piece of shit.
8522980	8523320	Mac.
8524720	8527721	The opinions expressed on this show by Loki.
8528281	8535283	Seriously, I think Apple computers are for people that don't know how to use computers, but think that pretty computers are good.
8536090	8542912	Loki is very lucky, he's far across the room from me right now, but he's not far enough to miss being hit in the head by a soda bottle or something.
8544332	8555235	Now, now, now, now, now, we have... In defense of Apple, I played on an Apple II computer, and I played a lot of kicks on that in Lode Runner, so okay.
8556957	8559159	Without Apple, we would not have had Oregon Trail.
8559219	8561540	Represent.
8561920	8564302	Or the first version of Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego.
8564662	8566083	Or Odell Lake.
8566263	8571106	Yeah, I was going to say Odell Lake.
8571146	8573648	My first computer was a Mac.
8574728	8578050	And it came in that little box with the 5-inch screen.
8578931	8581993	And I played a lot of Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego on that thing.
8582836	8587400	Oh my god, and you know, who needs to upgrade my computer or even work on it?
8587640	8592044	Because I can't get to it because goddammit, the monitor and the computer are the same damn thing!
8592404	8595787	I take that back, my first computer was the Texas Instruments computer.
8596644	8603807	Oh, and I forgot... I spent five hours programming in BASIC to watch a little ball bounce back and forth across the screen and change color.
8603867	8611831	And I forgot about Mac's contribution to the first-person shooter realm, Marathon, because that game is so much better than Quake and Unreal any day.
8612511	8615693	Okay, those games weren't even out yet when Marathon came out, man.
8617835	8618736	Whatever.
8618816	8622779	I can go on for hours about how bad Apple sucks, but I don't think I will.
8623259	8624561	Let's talk about Microsoft.
8624861	8630105	Microsoft sucks, too, because Service Pack 2's lame.
8630225	8632247	At least he's an equal opportunity offender.
8633940	8640405	They said, yeah, Microsoft Windows is never going to be secure until about, I don't know, 2011, 2015.
8641246	8642467	Well, thank you for warning me.
8642607	8643988	I'm buying your piece of shit now.
8644108	8645909	Oh, wait, no, I'm not buying your piece of shit now.
8645949	8647010	I'm downloading it for free.
8649174	8652717	Even by then, the hackers will have new, you know, things to break.
8652837	8657201	It doesn't matter, it's just, you know, their software's gonna suck, no matter what.
8657221	8659943	But it's all we have, okay, Loki?
8661424	8662825	It's what you get when you outsource.
8663786	8667949	You know, those people in India, they're just not as sharp as those people in, you know, America.
8668049	8669971	No, wait, I'm wrong, they are sharper than them.
8672552	8685499	Anyways, um, no, other than that, um, really not anything else I'm mad at other than, um, well, not anyone being at QZAR last night because there, I don't know where the hell people were in Vacaville.
8685999	8690001	No, no, no, I'm not talking about you, I'm talking about the Vacaville folk that normally are there.
8690021	8690462	Oh, is that normal?
8690482	8692963	You know, there's no Skater Cowboy, no anything.
8693303	8693583	Oh, yeah.
8693623	8694384	No Skater Cowboy.
8694504	8696565	It was just, no one there.
8696705	8700407	It's like, oh my god, they left Vacaville.
8701147	8701908	That's scary.
8702754	8704155	All the things just keep getting better
8730982	8732523	No, things just keep getting worse.
8732603	8741749	No, actually, it's been an okay week, but I would just first like to say, you know what, if I was going to say F you to Apple, that's because I was a Commodore 64 fan back in the day.
8743310	8746032	But I've been contemplating buying a Mac laptop.
8746812	8748193	I'm not going to listen to Loki.
8748433	8749054	I kind of want one.
8750074	8752176	Anyway, because laptops are different.
8752236	8753257	I think laptops are different.
8753317	8755778	Because you can't upgrade even a PC laptop very easily.
8756339	8756979	Not very easily.
8757475	8760118	You can put up like a memory upgrade, and that's the main thing you can do.
8760238	8761099	I want one!
8761219	8761940	I want one!
8762760	8763321	Where?
8763341	8774412	Uh, otherwise, uh, an F you, uh, I don't know, an F you to the fact that I'm leaving again in just over a week, and that makes me sad.
8774913	8779217	And I don't want to leave again for two weeks, especially with everything that's kind of going on back home.
8780323	8781624	You get paid a lot of money.
8781644	8782605	Maybe I could get SARS.
8782745	8784427	You get paid in money and sex.
8784527	8788130	Yeah, on the other hand, at the same time... Shut up, Nelly.
8788650	8794074	At the same time, when I do go, the company pays for all my food, so that'll be extra money that I can spend on video games!
8796016	8797477	No, go ahead and finish the FQs.
8797517	8799439	I completely forgot about that.
8800179	8803162	I guess I'm done since the rest of you are going to take all the time.
8804316	8804576	Oh.
8805357	8805517	Oh.
8806257	8806757	No, no, no.
8807137	8808778	This wasn't about FUs of the Week.
8808818	8812640	This is... I won a trip to San Diego in October.
8813120	8816802	I'm gonna be staying at the Hotel Del Coronado.
8818063	8822125	Which is basically a fucking expensive hotel, which is also haunted.
8822685	8824886	And, um... Take your germanium.
8825066	8826066	I mean, your portal to hell.
8826287	8828207	I mean, your... Shut up!
8829028	8831209	I'll never get past security on the plane.
8831329	8832149	They'll think it's a bomb.
8832249	8833370	Maybe... Oh, never mind.
8833997	8835298	What is that bomb you have?
8835558	8836319	It's not a bomb.
8836359	8837079	You said bomb!
8837099	8837980	You're a terrorist!
8838781	8839881	Okay, that's all I have.
8839921	8841883	But yeah, Hotel Del Coronado.
8842563	8844485	Awesome place in San Diego.
8844665	8846246	All expenses paid by my work.
8846786	8847107	Awesome.
8847227	8847627	Yummy.
8848668	8851009	OLR stalker fans, now you know where to find them.
8851209	8852130	Alright, moving on.
8853291	8856493	Let's go to Floatwalk with his FUs of the week.
8857754	8858154	Lordy.
8858295	8860236	Well, didn't go keep this actually pretty short.
8860923	8873675	First FA of the week goes to all the people over in Japan's board to say that the people who are creating steps for Ultramix 2 don't deserve to be doing any of it.
8874175	8876838	Oh, like you people do over on the board.
8876918	8877378	Come on.
8877398	8883884	It's funny because one of the biggest arguments is, well, I've never seen any of these guys ranked on the sim file community.
8884406	8885887	I'm sitting here thinking, what the hell?
8885907	8887248	That should be a credit!
8887869	8888870	Yeah, exactly!
8888890	8897177	I'm sitting here thinking, okay, wonderful, 90% of sim files I've seen are like 1,100, you know, finger steps, you know, patterns.
8897197	8897557	Yeah.
8897777	8905644	I mean, okay, you try putting 200 pounds of pressure on those fingers and doing that, then maybe, just maybe, I'll give you a little bit of credit there.
8906184	8906885	And like, you know...
8907617	8918065	Meanwhile, you're doing, you know, having a real life and making money doing your job, where these other people who have no jobs are sitting there doing nothing but making steps and putting them on communities and stuff.
8918285	8925030	Hey, I know there's a lot of probably a few cool, you know, people there online doing these steps, but seriously, he's got a life he needs to take care of first.
8925390	8936438	Yeah, I mean, you got all that going on, and I'm sitting here thinking, with all the edits you make in sim files, guess what, you're just making, you're basically playing 2DX there, you know, get with the other game, you know, don't waste your time on...
8936920	8947448	Arrow Smashing, you know, just saying we don't know what we're talking about, we're underqualified, but I could go off about how good we are and all that.
8947488	8949169	Have they even played any of the steps yet?
8949189	8950770	They're like, oh, they suck already!
8951971	8955734	Yeah, I mean, once the game drops, I think people are definitely going to be pleasantly surprised.
8955754	8956334	You know what, though?
8956394	8957455	People are still going to hate it.
8957475	8959016	Same thing I was telling Sigurd when he was here.
8959377	8960277	I said, you know what?
8960317	8962519	No matter what, when the game comes out, people are going to hate the steps.
8963451	8966153	And oh man, the people around the office were ready to throw down with, uh...
8988092	8989653	But you know, it's all good.
8989713	8990394	You know, we're rich.
8990574	8991415	Thanks.
8991615	8992896	Scoreboard.
8992956	8993856	Look at the scoreboard.
8994036	8995818	Our scoreboard says we got paychecks.
8997059	9001121	And last FB of the week just goes to work.
9001302	9004344	I know, yeah, you guys are thinking, why should I bitch about working at Konami?
9004504	9004884	Guess what?
9004944	9006445	I have to work tomorrow for Labor Day.
9007906	9009588	And not on a fun game at that.
9009768	9013050	But that said, you know, that just ain't right.
9013350	9015132	You know, I got people who want to spend time with me.
9015172	9017033	You know, I got a lady who needs some lovin' in.
9017489	9018110	You know, what happens?
9018230	9019511	I gotta leave her in the morning, man.
9019811	9022954	Like, you know, I'm just the, you know, John that picked her up and, you know, dumped her off, man.
9022994	9024295	Well, what's up with that?
9026437	9026958	Huh.
9027938	9030321	But, you know, it ain't really like that.
9030361	9032422	What's the point of having to work in the morning?
9032903	9033223	Sucks.
9033563	9034905	Oh, yeah, and one last F you.
9035185	9037007	Goes to Order of Chaos, actually.
9037327	9039149	Sure, you know, people say you shouldn't crack on your own.
9039169	9039769	Well, guess what?
9040169	9042952	Ever since he posted that rubbernecking post of all the car accidents...
9043405	9048249	Every day I've commuted to work, I've had to be stopped because of, like, traffic accidents happening.
9048669	9053533	So he's made my commute, like, half an hour worse every single day ever since he posted that two weeks ago.
9053633	9055655	Thanks a whole hell of a lot for nothing.
9055875	9056956	You get no Oreos.
9057236	9057536	Bye.
9058677	9058977	Wow.
9059658	9060639	I love you anyway.
9061639	9066263	So, special lady, Shark Skrull, do you have any FUs you'd like to give us tonight?
9066903	9068605	Well, I kind of did, and then...
9069150	9072311	I'm just in pain and kind of mellow now, so this F.U.
9072351	9073792	space for rent, highest bidder.
9073812	9076673	I bid a penny.
9077674	9078794	Give me a dollar, bitch.
9081775	9083176	Angel, your F.U.s of the week.
9084356	9085577	Alright, F.U.
9085657	9098082	to SBC for basically giving us the lowdown of having, or we have to pay $150 to get a phone jack in the den to have DSL.
9099254	9099855	And you know what?
9100035	9101435	I don't think I want to play that.
9101575	9121125	I'm going to shop around a bit, see if... Well, yeah, we can do Cable too, but... We want... This is true, but... I want to... Other people in the house want to exhaust all options first before... Subjecting to Cable, so we'll see what happens.
9121145	9124767	Well, Cable in Sacramento is just better than all the DSL in Sacramento, so... Probably.
9125007	9126588	You might want to research that.
9128450	9131613	Yeah, it's Loki at the internet.
9132173	9132814	I'm Al Gore.
9132894	9135436	I created the internet.
9137117	9140400	Alright, and I don't know.
9142622	9143323	I guess that's it.
9143643	9145304	Because I can't think of anything at the moment.
9146125	9148567	Alright, let's go on to Explicit.
9148787	9149308	You're FU's.
9156004	9157225	Alright, okay.
9157586	9159828	I wanna give an F to Texas Hold'em.
9160869	9161790	God damn it.
9162510	9166895	I need some cards that goes at least an 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King at least.
9167255	9169077	All I'm getting is nothing but 2s and 3s.
9170198	9173901	How the hell can you win an actual Texas Hold'em game with just those cards?
9174142	9174842	Someone's cheating.
9175403	9177525	Play 2-7 offsuit, best hand in the game.
9179594	9187701	Yeah, but, fuck, I'm not wasting no fucking 40 bucks, and another F you goes to my family for forcing me to play the damn game.
9188962	9191344	God damn it, I told you I'm not wasting more money.
9192124	9195487	I only play games that I know I'm gonna win money on, like Blackjack.
9197028	9199310	I get 200 on cash for kicking that.
9200471	9202593	Told them, ah, no wins whatsoever.
9203734	9208978	Or should I just say fuck you to the cards and sell for giving me the bad luck?
9210931	9211251	Okay.
9211932	9215815	And fuck you to some lady throwing a damn beer bottle in my head.
9217657	9217917	What?
9219158	9221080	I just mentioned this before.
9222661	9224622	That's just her way of saying I love you.
9225283	9225924	No!
9226324	9227365	No, no, no, no.
9228145	9229246	Yeah, she wants to share a drink.
9229266	9231008	Nothing says I love you like a beer in my face.
9231048	9231288	A drink?
9231308	9232429	Kill me with a drink.
9233490	9234771	I got hit in the head right here.
9235872	9236993	Oh, dude.
9237773	9238974	Got hit in the top of my head.
9239074	9239495	Damn it.
9242796	9245038	You should have been like, oh, you want a drink, huh, bitch?
9245238	9246179	Beer tastes good.
9246199	9248421	I was just waving like this.
9248941	9252044	You didn't have to throw a damn beer bottle at me.
9252084	9254686	Perhaps you were thinking tastes great and she really meant less filling.
9256188	9256348	Oh.
9257349	9258470	Oh, dear.
9258530	9261772	All right, anything else?
9262833	9266477	F you for some kids kissing on my Toyota Corolla S tire.
9267037	9267337	What?
9268078	9268438	Yes.
9269699	9270320	Dude.
9272140	9273121	Holy crap!
9273221	9275302	You know, waving is the first step to rape.
9277924	9279726	She was only defending herself.
9281507	9289553	There's a reason why there's porta... There's a fucking reason why there's porta potties in bathrooms.
9291675	9294316	You can't piss on tires, they don't clean the tires.
9298431	9305737	F you to the security up at the Rage for breaking up a battle and stuff and for breaking up people freak dancing in there.
9305857	9306777	Oh goody, that's what I'm going tonight.
9306797	9312682	Just because I have a nice boner by accident after some girl's freaking on me does not fucking be how raping her.
9313162	9315464	Remember that part about TMI being in the show?
9315624	9316365	Remember that part?
9316945	9319327	Raping is a crime, but freak dancing is not.
9322095	9322616	Oh, man.
9322636	9323237	Alright, anything else?
9323918	9325381	Let's just say, do be continued.
9325702	9326102	Alright.
9326563	9326804	As usual.
9326824	9327385	Who else?
9327405	9328226	That's too much.
9328427	9330751	LankyStyle.
9331192	9333196	Do you really want to go there?
9334886	9336127	You say what you want, buddy.
9336187	9336868	Say whatever you want.
9336888	9337168	Okay.
9338169	9349798	All I have to say is big F you to people who want to fucking... Miserable people who have made their lives fucking horrible on their own and want to fucking bring everybody else down because they're fucking immature little fucking pricks.
9350158	9351759	You go ahead and do it without us.
9352360	9356543	Go ahead, drive your fucking car off the road and kill yourself because no one's going to fucking miss you.
9357165	9359746	Don't bring us down because you're shit.
9359806	9365547	I don't need to really go into detail, it's kind of a personal thing, but it's been a fucking rocky weekend.
9365767	9371249	And they have to understand, to open a door, it does not require your fist going through the door, but there's a handle there.
9372489	9377271	And yes, goddammit, Diet Dr. Pepper does taste like regular Dr. Pepper.
9378091	9380792	No sacrifices here, Ren.
9384343	9387645	I think we have a segment or a little subject for a Wednesday show, right?
9387825	9388246	Alright.
9389527	9391068	Gypsy Wolf, do you have any FUs?
9391488	9392008	It's brilliant.
9392249	9394670	Okay, FU to Sacramento for not having any decent clubs.
9395351	9396251	I haven't found one yet.
9396412	9397633	I still have yet to find one.
9397793	9398553	I've been to a couple.
9398653	9400495	Most of them are either really ghetto or really teeny-bopper.
9400515	9401375	Have you been to Pace's?
9402296	9402476	No.
9403237	9405638	If you can put up with the gaiety, it's a lot of fun.
9406319	9407420	And there's sexy men there.
9407440	9408260	I'll take you there sometime.
9412503	9413283	I have not been that far.
9413443	9413944	I haven't had time.
9415024	9415324	Anything else?
9415344	9416805	Anyway, no, nothing else.
9417585	9417885	All right.
9419046	9421707	Let's go on to our chat room if you then, unless Nelly had something.
9423007	9423747	Where's Rice Princess?
9423767	9425468	Is she off playing Harvest Moon still?
9425488	9425928	You know what?
9426328	9426568	Okay.
9426588	9427109	Let's not go there.
9427769	9428089	Okay.
9428709	9429209	Moving on.
9429309	9433071	Let's see what's going on with the chat room.
9434874	9439376	Dark Knight says, My super FU is to work as always and financial setbacks.
9439456	9441797	And for the record, I have to work on Labor Day as well.
9442417	9445438	Sigurd says, My first FU goes to Sweet Coden IV.
9445538	9447219	Blasphemous for me to say it, I know.
9447539	9449360	The FU is for the game being too short.
9449440	9452621	I'm almost done over 90 stars and only at 22 hours.
9453021	9457383	An FU to parties not wanting my sexy level 12 thief in Final Fantasy XI to join them.
9460664	9461785	Karma Titan says,
9462694	9463735	He wants to get political.
9463775	9465095	He says, F you, George Bush.
9465195	9465776	Bush lied.
9465816	9466456	People died.
9467056	9470658	F you, I lived through 110 plus all freaking day and it ain't that bad.
9471198	9473139	F you, all your base are belongs to us.
9475701	9476041	Oh, boy.
9478562	9482865	VXJasonXV says, I would like to submit one on behalf of my right-hand.
9483045	9488908	F you to Adelphia for breaking cable two days ago and not planning on doing anything about it until Wednesday.
9489008	9489428	That is all.
9491070	9493831	Ninst says, F you to my job and the people I work with.
9493871	9496673	The job is getting to be bullshit and the people are getting more stupid.
9497173	9502596	Ninst also says, F you to my computer, I had to format earlier, and of course, there were problems during the format.
9503296	9508338	DDR Nemesis says, F you to Floatwalk and Dancer X for giving clues that are too fucking hard.
9509979	9512940	It would be really easy clues if you had paid attention in school.
9512960	9516602	I don't know, the more you scream, the harder it gets.
9516942	9517643	Ooh, there you go.
9521011	9523111	Wait a second, isn't that what you told me last night?
9523312	9528793	I was just gonna... Damn it, you stole... I was just gonna say it's like sex.
9528853	9530473	The more you relax, the easier it'll get.
9530593	9533734	Anyway.
9534554	9539615	BlackDevilRx says, You know Loki is really a good guy, so F you to the guy who threw a beer bottle at him.
9539695	9541135	Except that was explicit.
9541455	9541955	The beer bottle.
9544476	9547917	And he says... He also says F you to Service Pack 2.
9550313	9557960	Misty says, F you to the little kids that like to scream their lungs off when I'm at work, the arcade, and already have a headache.
9558941	9564125	Shade23 says, F you to California for having such better arcades than us on the East Coast, bastards.
9564505	9566027	Hey, come to Sacramento sometime.
9566047	9566867	You'll feel right at home.
9567488	9569530	If by better you mean broken, then yes.
9572032	9572252	Luke.
9573985	9582572	Lunarius says, F you to DJ Potato for all of his music, especially for killing 511 with his remix 344, and also F you to Hurricane Francis.
9583092	9588036	F you to Wicco for not sending me my white poppin' buttons and delaying me building my poppin' ASC.
9588397	9590478	I happen to like DJ Potato, he's a cool guy.
9591639	9591959	Meanie.
9592360	9596063	F you to BlackDevilRx for not caring about me, dammit!
9596643	9599685	SilentBen says, F you to Sakura for singling me out.
9600006	9601447	I think he meant DarkSakura.
9602848	9604689	She's different than the song in DDR.
9605410	9606351	Please don't boot me.
9608213	9610595	Okay, you need to realize something about me.
9611536	9613738	I only single people out out of love.
9614458	9614939	There you go.
9615640	9617742	She's singling you out for a hug.
9619003	9619984	Aw, hugs!
9622030	9650471	Legend of Zaku says F you to the fact that summer is over F you to having to spend 3 hours shopping for a new backpack today F you to Sam Goody for selling $18.99 CDs for songs that have been out almost over 9 years F you to having nothing to do this Labor Day weekend and F you to myself for having to exchange a belt I bought at Hot Topic today for a larger size thinking that the first one was going to fit me F you to Microsoft for shitting on XP users with piss poor fixes such as Service Pack 2
9653567	9656188	Pixie Dust says, my FU goes to carpal tunnel syndrome.
9656228	9662512	The hospital doctor that saw me was such a cunt and happened to tell me that he hates Bel Air so much, so fuck him.
9662892	9664593	Typing one hand sucks monkey balls.
9664653	9667154	Other than that, FU goes to pain, FU goes to boredom.
9668435	9674198	Same says, FU to GameStop for looking at me like I was a dumbass for asking for the US Extreme VRare.
9674658	9676980	And FU to Floatwalk for dissing my edit site.
9679081	9681282	I dissed it some more, but I didn't see a damn thing on there.
9682481	9686843	DarkKnight says, OhSky, a bonus FU to the major reign we had in Virginia recently.
9686923	9688724	Almost made Richmond look like the new Atlantis.
9688804	9689544	Totally underwater.
9690064	9693526	Flaronay says, FU to Scandia for still not fixing the DDR pad.
9694526	9697127	KarmaTitan says, FU to Altoids Tangerine.
9697207	9698228	Sours are sour.
9700149	9701849	And Misty has the last word.
9702370	9705791	FU to the Arcade for bringing the EX to three songs for credit.
9706071	9706631	It was four.
9706731	9707872	And taking off the unlocks.
9710515	9711696	Oh, I'll give John Fields one.
9711876	9714257	FU to construction on highways that should have been finished years ago.
9714557	9715097	Okay, that's it.
9715257	9715837	No more FUs.
9715897	9716617	We're done with the segment.
9716678	9717018	It's done.
9717098	9717458	It's over.
9717938	9718338	Complete.
9718418	9718758	Finished.
9720039	9720359	Alright.
9721660	9723480	Oh, God, that was a long FU segment tonight.
9724080	9724421	Shit.
9727642	9730923	I think we need to talk about some, like, actual Bimani news at this point.
9731383	9733744	Is there anything else we could... You mean there's Bimani news?
9733844	9735145	What's that Bimani crap?
9737503	9740424	I forgot what that was, because we haven't talked about it in a long time.
9743805	9753747	Well, it's not really Bomani news, but it's Dance Mania news, and as we all know, the Japanese folks always get a lot of their songs from the Dance Mania CDs.
9754027	9760789	There is a CD called Trans Paradise that was recently released in Japan for 1,995 yen.
9761109	9761969	Trans Paradise.
9762089	9765250	Tracklist isn't here yet, but we'll post it to our website soon.
9766335	9778922	and in not really related to Bomani per se, but those of you guys that play a lot of video games, if you were listening to Wednesday's show, you heard about Acclaim, the video game publisher for such games as Turok.
9779162	9780263	They went bankrupt.
9780443	9780623	Bye-bye.
9780643	9781664	Acclaim is gone.
9784105	9788127	I remember back in the days when Acclaim was cool, back in the days when we had NBA Jam.
9790008	9793350	I say a moment of silence for Acclaim.
9802143	9802603	I'm sorry.
9802923	9803343	I'm sorry.
9803403	9805564	Did you say a moment of silence for acclaim?
9806865	9809645	You know, I have a problem with the volume of my voice.
9809785	9812346	No, I can't do that because I'd be too obvious.
9813587	9814807	I like the NBA Jam.
9814847	9815707	It was awesome.
9816828	9819709	You know, I would always kick ass on it.
9820289	9820789	And, um...
9821977	9822978	It was really cool.
9824259	9828923	I wish that game was still around, though, because I think they got rid of it, but whatever.
9829843	9830684	Yeah.
9830764	9836008	Anyway, let's give the folks in the chat room another chance to guess at that news.
9836088	9836949	I hope someone gets it.
9836969	9837910	I want to play this song.
9838010	9840972	Don't let Dancer X have another victory, you guys.
9840992	9841613	You need to get it.
9842654	9843314	I will say this.
9843494	9849459	As I was scrolling back through the text of everyone in the chat room, someone...
9849935	9850696	DarkSakura.com
9870831	9873753	Loki has a song he would like to play for all you guys.
9874193	9881757	And I have to yell at everyone a little bit because we've been trying to get you guys to participate by naming this remix in our forums.
9881777	9882758	To hell with you people.
9882778	9888341	And we've gotten maybe like two guesses or two suggestions that weren't that great.
9888361	9888961	And they suck.
9890069	9894390	Some of you guys said, though, you were like, we need to hear it one more time before we can give it a name.
9894470	9895050	So, fine.
9895390	9895950	Here you go.
9896270	9898511	Your last chance to hear this mix and give it a name.
9898911	9899391	Fair enough?
9900071	9900471	Uh, yeah.
9900771	9901091	All right.
9901111	9902732	I already have a name if you don't pick one.
9902852	9903152	All right.
9903212	9907513	So, Loki with a remix of Radical Faith, as yet unnamed.
9907873	9910613	So, go to our forums, www.orangetownsradio.com.
9910673	9914654	Look for the thread in Bimani Discussion and guess and give it a title.
9915234	9915874	Whatever you want.
9916014	9919615	And Sigurd Rocks, as cute as that was, is not a good remix title.
9921206	9923068	That would be for, like, an Echo Image remix or something.
9923188	9923448	Alright.
9924649	9925169	Alright, here it is.
9925590	9928512	Anything else you want to say about this remix of Radical Faith, Loki, that you did?
9928632	9928933	Brand new?
9929073	9929693	Nah, not really.
9930434	9930734	Alright.
9931335	9935598	And again, we're open for guesses, and I've gotten one guess so far from Sigurd.
9936279	9938201	And he's guessing, is it Love Love Shine?
9939962	9942124	And no, this song is not Love Love Shine.
9942164	9943085	And you can't guess, you dumbass!
9943125	9946848	You should have guessed the same thing you guessed the first two times, because you were right the first two times.
9949028	9951110	Alright, here it is, Loki's brand new remix of Radical Faith.
9951130	9952492	I want some... no.
9952832	9953313	Name this.
9954154	9956416	I'm just going to shut up now because I'll just give it away.
9956456	9958859	Alright, www.orange.radio.com, forums, name it.
10048086	10048587	Thanks for watching!
10133325	10136106	Very sexy from Loki, Radical Faith.
10136567	10137427	An unnamed remix.
10137447	10141549	And I gave you guys the URL to post to on our forum.
10142510	10142990	Oh, I'm sorry.
10143030	10143711	I'm a little loud.
10144091	10144311	Sorry.
10144651	10145492	Yeah, quit yelling.
10145512	10147813	Jamie still has a raging headache right now.
10149654	10149934	All right.
10151417	10152958	and Explicit as a raging boner.
10155479	10156200	And you noticed.
10157160	10160683	Well, no, he was saying earlier in a story that freak dancing is not illegal.
10161003	10162043	It's like... Raging boner.
10162143	10164925	It's like, I don't know, remember realultimatepower.net?
10165605	10166586	No, sorry.
10166706	10167867	This script is awesome.
10170728	10174411	Again, as a reminder, please don't send me your guesses or your suggestions.
10174471	10177973	I should say, over private message, you want to go to the forums and post those.
10178293	10179934	That link I posted in the chat room that says...
10180782	10184965	Don't talk condescendingly to your listeners Don't patronize them Way to go, Loki!
10184985	10185285	Way to go, Loki!
10185305	10185925	Scare off our listeners, Loki!
10185945	10186666	Way to go, Loki!
10186726	10187886	Scare off our listeners!
10188847	10190908	That's right, cry over it Yeah, that's right, Loki, your music sucks
10211653	10212274	You know what?
10212294	10213375	This vacuum sucks.
10226832	10229173	Are you going to do maple syrup shots over there, Loki?
10229513	10231994	Syrup?
10232074	10236776	He has a thing of Mrs. Butterworth going, Rob, as if I find Mrs. Butterworth hot or something.
10238396	10241637	Monday night, Diversion, Bomani Remixes, 7 o'clock, tune in, love it.
10242798	10244578	What's happening on Tuesday night, Jamie?
10245098	10247039	You need to be mixing some Malibu with that shit.
10247079	10248139	That happens on Tuesday night?
10248620	10248840	No.
10250220	10252241	Tuesday night, pump up the volume.
10253201	10254982	Starring me, the awesome and...
10255629	10261313	You know, I went to GameCrazy, and the guy there gave me my official nickname.
10261573	10264555	He was asking me what my name was, because they were putting in something for some order.
10265195	10268797	And I was like, my name is Jamie the Great and Terrible.
10268977	10273280	And he was like, how about Jamie the Truly Awesome and Never Nice?
10273560	10274761	So that's my new official title.
10275081	10275822	And Never Nice.
10276062	10276702	And Never Nice.
10276862	10280044	I am officially Completely Awesome and Never Nice.
10281125	10282846	Anyway, my show...
10283832	10285914	is on Tuesday, and it's called Pump Up the Volume.
10286514	10290157	And I have a pre-show that starts at 7, although when I'm really bored it starts earlier than that.
10291158	10295942	And the show starts at 7.30, but because I now have to get my ass up at 5 a.m.
10296002	10303047	every morning, my show is usually over right at 10.30, unless I'm really bored and I'll keep it going.
10303788	10310093	But I was supposed to do my show last Tuesday, and I had to do an emergency announcement because I had to get my homework done.
10311636	10317943	So blame my apartment manager for not turning on my AC, so I couldn't concentrate to do my homework on Monday, so I had to do it on Tuesday.
10319465	10327153	But as promised, I'm going to be doing Overclocked remixes, and I'm thinking about marathoning another CD.
10327233	10328955	I don't know, maybe Sim & Flow, I don't know.
10329335	10330156	Maybe Echo Image.
10330356	10331097	Maybe Echo Image.
10331478	10332158	That's a good idea.
10332178	10332659	I don't know, I just...
10333100	10334841	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
10364406	10376816	Well, we were going to go to break, but it's only ten minutes left in the show, so I thought actually we'd just go ahead and just kind of skip the break and come back to what we were going to do.
10377416	10378337	Wait, one more show.
10379098	10379258	Huh?
10379498	10380078	One more show.
10380939	10382200	Oh yeah, I'm sorry, Wednesday nights.
10382940	10384582	Mikey Style, tell us about Wednesday nights.
10384862	10389886	Wednesday nights is the night, you know, you're probably like, hey, it's Wednesday night, it's hump night, you know.
10390326	10392528	Starting to feel good about the work week, you know.
10393194	10402440	So why don't you come on over and tune in at 7 o'clock at Orange Lounge Radio on Live 365 and listen to Outside the Box.
10403801	10406303	Because like the name says, it's quite outside the box.
10408324	10409705	Even though we talk a lot about boxes.
10410305	10410825	I don't know why.
10412366	10417730	But the main reason why you should listen to the show is because I co-host it with Rice Princess.
10418516	10420197	You know, so it's not just Rob all the time.
10420217	10423380	Because Rob's the queen that always takes over the show, you know, runs it.
10424300	10425922	So, please, listen.
10426362	10427623	7 o'clock, Wednesday nights.
10430765	10432166	We have another guest on the song.
10433668	10436170	Yeah, and I definitely want to share this one because we're almost out of show.
10436290	10437451	I really want someone to get it.
10437491	10439852	So it's an open forum for the rest of the show.
10440373	10443175	Send in your guesses for the rest of the show and hopefully someone gets it.
10443455	10444476	Here's what Jazz guessed.
10445114	10445934	Loki, don't even.
10445954	10447015	You're going to get somebody in trouble.
10448215	10449115	I have a guess.
10449355	10449595	What?
10450135	10450796	It's a song.
10450936	10451856	Yeah, it is.
10451896	10452276	Flow walk.
10452476	10453376	Let's get a flow walk on mic.
10454517	10455357	Okay, lay it on me.
10455657	10459078	Jazz is guessing nucleus with something smooth.
10459498	10464339	There's a cell in the body that does not have a nucleus, and the jelly and cream cheese on the bagel are both smooth.
10464879	10466160	I'll give you something smooth.
10467380	10467820	Wow.
10468561	10472662	You know, when I said people were onto something, I was not kidding.
10473122	10473942	He is onto it.
10474585	10476166	However, he is only half right.
10477086	10483248	Ooh, well, you got ten minutes to figure it out, or else you're going to go another week without knowing.
10483288	10483808	Sorry, guys.
10484149	10486930	Rob, I think we should just keep playing Gem and Marble.
10486970	10488550	Nah, just don't even go there.
10488590	10490891	Just don't even go there, because you're going to get somebody in trouble.
10491371	10491751	Shut up.
10492352	10492652	All right.
10493712	10495293	Loki, you're not allowed to talk the rest of the show.
10495553	10495893	Give me!
10496133	10498954	Ducky, ducky, ducky, ducky, ducky!
10498994	10500115	Give to Radical.
10501695	10503736	Let's do some Ask Orange Lounge, boys and girls.
10510221	10513204	Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.
10513685	10517068	What will we find out tonight on Ask Orange Lounge?
10517609	10524335	We're going to make a jam and then we're going to get it on and hopefully someone will get that clue right.
10524956	10525676	Did you say jam?
10526898	10527318	Moving on.
10528956	10530497	This show's on something after all.
10531798	10534840	Skyblind's open as well, but please don't call if you've already been on this show.
10534880	10536541	We want other people to have a chance.
10537101	10542485	Well, I mean, I'm just saying that, you know, don't, you know, spread the love.
10542585	10543986	I wonder how jam shots would be.
10544066	10544706	Shut up!
10545547	10547107	Shut up, seriously.
10548568	10551070	People are never going to come back to this program.
10552231	10552551	All right.
10557503	10557803	All right.
10559504	10564667	I was going to take some questions from our chat room, but I don't see any questions.
10564767	10566368	Ask your question now.
10567889	10570070	Shut up, Loki.
10570751	10573092	I swear to God I'm going to clock you with this microphone.
10573592	10575313	Hey, don't clock him.
10579415	10579796	All right.
10580896	10581997	Zachu has a question.
10582037	10582897	Legend of Zachu has a question.
10583598	10585499	How did you spend your summer vacation?
10587060	10593986	At work, answering 40 plus calls in queue from people trying to get student loans to go to school.
10594386	10596088	That's how I spent my summer vacation.
10596208	10596628	Next!
10600992	10606477	At work, supposedly answering calls, but... Eh, supposedly.
10606657	10606877	Okay.
10607137	10611521	Anyways, um... I added it!
10611801	10613503	It's my own word now.
10614242	10616303	Anyways.
10616944	10620686	I was supposed to be answering calls, but I was browsing the internet instead.
10622187	10623127	Yay, internet!
10623688	10626189	Like many of you, I spent my summer not getting laid.
10627110	10628070	Luckily, summer's over.
10628691	10629771	I'm not included in that.
10631672	10632613	I was talking to our chat room.
10632753	10635054	Anyway, FloWalk, how did you spend your summer vacation?
10636595	10640598	In a room right underneath an air conditioning vent, making step data for...
10641533	10642273	Someone figured it out.
10665808	10667709	Finally, we have a winner.
10668030	10670852	Thank God, we get to play the damn song before the night's over.
10671252	10672453	You don't say.
10672953	10674875	So, what's the guess, Rob?
10674895	10675976	Well, who got it, first of all?
10676016	10678437	Well, the winner is White Rob, is the person who got it.
10678477	10679859	Not me, I'm a White Rob as well.
10681280	10682060	Ho, ho, ho.
10682941	10684902	That's very obvious, given your outfit, Rob.
10685803	10688705	And I'm giving him permission to tell our chat room what it is.
10688805	10693949	So, the next thing White Rob says to you guys will be the name of the new song.
10694209	10695310	God, it's about time.
10695629	10696989	So WhiteRob, it's on you, buddy.
10698510	10699850	He does not have Skype.
10699870	10701891	He's on 56k, so he can't Skype him.
10702311	10703791	But WhiteRob figured it out.
10705052	10706872	So he just gets to post it in our chatroom.
10706892	10708613	By the way, I really like this song.
10709193	10710133	Watch him get booted.
10710233	10712094	I'm going to cue it up so you guys can hear some of it.
10714115	10715655	Oh, but he misspelled it.
10715775	10717656	He misspelled it, but he still got it right.
10718076	10718796	Close enough.
10721097	10721677	Nucleus.
10723697	10723938	All right.
10726440	10727442	So what is it, guys?
10727603	10729226	Let's tell the people who are not in the chat room.
10729246	10729968	What is the song?
10731230	10731811	Anybody want to say?
10732092	10733435	It's Slow Walk, you should say.
10734695	10740641	The song is by a group called Nucleus back from the mid-80s, and the joint is called Jam On It.
10740801	10743143	And this is a very unique song for DDR.
10743203	10745645	All I can say is this song is a little bit special for DDR.
10746185	10751110	The only mix of the song I have is 8 minutes in length, so I'm going to only play you guys a clip, because 8 minutes is a long time.
10751130	10753512	Oh, I'm sure the first, like, minute and a half, two minutes should be good enough.
10754132	10756755	So I'm just going to kind of start in the middle here and see what we get.
10756795	10757115	Here we go.
10759124	10768927	If you don't know how, get ready to learn, cause Cosmo's taking his turn to burn Take a seat, and know when to see, then you add M-O-N-E-R-E-E-D-E-D-E-D-E-D-E-D-E-D-E-D-E-D-E-D-E-D-E-D-E-D-E-D-E-D-E-D-E
10788885	10813300	Don't get down, let me rock you to the rhythm of the funky sound From hill to hill above sea to sea And when jam on's rocking everybody scream Jam on it, jam on it, on it, on it, on it While we're feeling like we want to dance on that thing Go on ahead and float it Cause jamming on is what we do best It's what separates us from the rest And if you don't think who's there for real Let me tell you what happened to the man who did it
10833030	10835711	Alright, that should give you a good idea of what that song sounds like.
10835931	10839192	How many of you guys remember that Blast From The Past song there?
10840552	10845594	Hopefully, Dancer X isn't too upset that, you know, somebody got it figured out, but you know what?
10846034	10849155	That is the longest clue that ever went without being figured out.
10849275	10851396	So for that, we give Dancer a big
10852225	10854366	F you, buddy, for making our lives hell.
10854906	10855606	F you, buddy!
10855986	10862308	I can't believe they didn't get it after we played Jam and Marmalade on the jazz in It's Raining Men.
10862388	10868390	I thought that would be like... I thought that was completely obvious, too, but I guess people just... People don't think we can have any fun with it.
10868410	10870970	Like I said, you guys did not have to think very abstract.
10871210	10873711	There was a bagel, there was jam on it.
10874625	10877146	and the bagel kind of looked like a nucleus or something.
10877166	10877826	Well, don't blame me.
10877846	10879567	That's probably DancerX's lame idea.
10880968	10884589	Don't explain the method to your guys' madness, you know, or to his madness.
10885090	10887411	Our madness is, we give you clues, you suffer.
10889392	10890372	Rinse, repeat.
10891332	10894594	Alright.
10897745	10900727	Hope you guys enjoyed, and congratulations, WhiteRob, for figuring that out.
10900807	10902488	You all owe him sex.
10902868	10903228	Or her.
10903448	10904969	I imagine it's a him, though, because his name's Rob.
10905349	10909211	You all owe him sex for getting that right before the end of the show, just under the wire.
10909332	10910852	I'll send him some chocolate instead.
10910912	10911553	Same difference.
10913794	10914134	Alright.
10915315	10919797	I'll buy him one of those blow-up pillows from JList.com.
10920258	10922119	I have to say, I'm excited to play that song.
10922159	10922919	It's booty as it is.
10922999	10925781	I think it brings back Solo, everything that was great about Solo.
10926365	10930766	Well, I think this is just showing up, like, for Ultramix 2, how eclectic the music really is.
10930826	10937268	I mean, you heard everything from, like, you know, just sort of, like, you heard trance, you've heard house.
10937288	10942589	I mean, obviously now you're hearing, like, old school rap, so we're trying to touch as many, yeah, you know, break it.
10942629	10944609	We're just trying to hit as many bases as we can.
10946370	10946850	More to come.
10949311	10951151	Any fun ideas for clues in the future?
10952864	10956405	I don't know, we're still working on what to do next.
10956666	10957046	Alright.
10957706	10960207	Okay, you know what guys, it's time to wrap up the show.
10960247	10961988	I hate to say it, but the show's about over here.
10962408	10965949	So let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
10966049	10969431	And for those of you guys that didn't get your Ask Orange Lounge questions in, stay tuned to Afterbirth.
10969451	10970271	We'll get those answered.
10971552	10973613	Let's see, let's start with LankyStyle, your final thought.
10976174	10976454	Hi.
10978054	10982016	Alright, let's go to... Oh, I've been drinking a little bit and I feel pretty good.
10982566	10983186	All right, sounds good.
10983846	10985967	Let's go to, I guess, Floatwalk.
10985987	10986447	You get a mic.
10986587	10987227	What's your final thought?
10988307	10989907	Message over to you, same in the chat room.
10989927	10993428	I got three letters for you, L-O-L.
10994228	10996008	And Sharkscroll, your final thought?
10996348	10998489	I'm feeling very Jerry Springer here.
10999209	10999549	All right.
11001329	11002209	Angel, your final thought?
11002890	11004270	I got a present from Loki.
11004610	11004970	Yay.
11005590	11006670	Yay.
11006770	11007270	Oh, the CD?
11007570	11008671	Yes, the CD.
11009491	11010511	Explicit, your final thought?
11014482	11015523	Can you come back to me on that one?
11016204	11016704	Can I what?
11016784	11017165	Come back.
11017405	11017565	No.
11018806	11019366	Damn you!
11020107	11021588	Alright, Loki, your final thought.
11023249	11024951	If I shake my head, I get dizzy.
11027053	11028013	He's getting drunk, guys.
11028314	11029655	Gypsy Wolf, your final thought.
11033938	11036640	Whoever's throwing beer bottles at people for waving, keep doing it.
11036680	11037381	It's kind of entertaining.
11040744	11041924	My final thought is...
11043092	11046915	Listen to our station a lot and whore up our hours and win an Akira Yamaoka CD.
11050338	11051379	DarkSakura, your final thought.
11053321	11061228	My final thought is I want to go on leave and travel, but I want to be paid for it.
11061948	11063390	So pay me to travel.
11064050	11067833	Send me to... What the fuck are you doing with that CD?
11072230	11075631	My final thought is... I want air conditioning!
11076731	11077071	And money.
11078612	11078952	And sex.
11079272	11079612	All right.
11080012	11082193	We're going to give... Wow.
11082533	11083013	In that order?
11083473	11085433	In that order, because air conditioning is more important.
11085673	11085934	All right.
11086914	11090355	The final word of tonight's show, I'm going to give it to somebody who didn't say a whole lot tonight.
11090455	11093696	Shark Skrull, you've got to give us one word that sums everything up.
11094216	11095776	The final word of the show.

11318150	11322472	Alright, here's the afterbirth, the part of the show after the credits have faded to black.
11323112	11329235	I gotta make this quick tonight because I'm going out tonight, but I wanted to get the rest of these Ask Orange Lounge questions in because there were some good ones in here.
11330676	11332917	I didn't think anyone was going to get the jam on it thing.
11333057	11333777	I seriously didn't.
11333837	11334838	Two minutes left in the show.
11334938	11339020	It was my drunkenness and saying I should do jam shots that clued them in.
11341421	11346623	Sigurd was going to ask, Dear Ask Orange Lounge, why can't the chat room figure out this easy clue?
11346683	11347724	Well, you got owned, didn't you?
11352757	11355639	Dark Knight says, I got one out of all the drunk shows.
11355720	11358522	What's the record for most drinks in an episode?
11359002	11359663	I have a guess.
11360143	11361644	Maybe DarkSakura wants to share.
11362165	11363566	Okay, what are you talking about?
11363586	11366768	The time I had, like, what, ten beverages within an hour?
11366788	11367389	Uh, you think?
11368990	11373613	Okay, the last drunk show that we did, I had four double shots of tequila.
11375575	11376536	That's cheap-ass stuff, too.
11377748	11383390	I had half a bottle of the mudslide mix, the TGR Friday's mudslide.
11384090	11391293	I finished off the rest about that much of a bottle, about maybe three inches worth of a bottle of the Long Island Iced Tea.
11391313	11391973	What else did I have?
11392033	11396194	Oh yeah, and I kept making these screwdrivers out of Malibu.
11397895	11399255	And I kept drinking those too.
11400276	11404297	So I was very drunk, and the thing is, is that where I have really good tolerance,
11405197	11407778	That much alcohol in the span of an hour.
11408318	11411900	I ended up passing out on Rob's bed and eating like half of Matt's box of waffles.
11412880	11413640	Yeah, I remember that.
11414901	11416621	Which I probably still owe you the waffles.
11417602	11418302	Yeah.
11418422	11419883	I'll get you some waffles.
11419943	11423804	Tonight I had, what was it, five screwdrivers.
11424364	11427085	All of them with two shots of vodka in them.
11427366	11430987	So I guess that'd be ten shots of vodka over the course of three hours.
11431457	11433358	Right now, really, I don't feel that drunk.
11433418	11434379	I mean, I'm a little dizzy.
11434679	11438321	Over the course of three hours is a lot better than over the course of an hour.
11438721	11446986	Well, I didn't want to kill myself, but, you know, um, no, right now I just feel very full because that's like a whole thing of orange juice right there.
11447006	11449007	I mean, that's a lot of orange juice.
11449188	11451329	What I'm worried about, though, Loki, sorry.
11453510	11458193	What I'm worried about, though, Loki, is you haven't, like, I haven't seen you go to the bathroom in these three hour spans.
11459200	11461341	You're a time bomb waiting to go off, man.
11462061	11462401	Why?
11462641	11466823	You drink that much alcohol and orange juice, something's going to explode, man.
11467623	11469203	My stomach, yeah.
11469223	11472845	Yeah, all over the... No, I've never thrown up from alcohol.
11472885	11474365	No, not throwing up, I'm talking about something else.
11474385	11475586	You haven't thrown up from the bathroom.
11477366	11478506	Uh, what's bathroom really?
11479987	11480327	Anyways.
11481227	11483208	I'm not into water sports, so take care of that.
11486338	11487399	I'll wake up in the middle of the night.
11487459	11488900	Why am I all wet?
11489060	11490781	I've got to hurry up through the rest of these questions, you guys.
11491442	11495005	Zaku, will you be playing drunk DDR and or any Bomani tonight?
11498168	11498668	Probably not.
11499029	11500790	I think most people are going home, and I'm going to the club.
11501531	11503393	Karma Titan says, question number 108.
11503973	11505054	Booga, booga, booga.
11505114	11505775	Yay or nay?
11509738	11511319	If you're referring to Booga, Booga...
11512677	11514639	No, I'm not playing any game where I stick a finger up someone's ass.
11514679	11515880	I think it was just Booga Booga Booga.
11516320	11517641	I say yay to Booga Booga Booga.
11517721	11518802	Booga Booga Booga is cool.
11519302	11520303	Booga Booga is not.
11520323	11521684	What is Booga Booga Booga?
11521804	11522184	I don't know.
11523265	11524947	Shay23, last question.
11525327	11528329	Any idea when the 8th style limited edition can be bought?
11531492	11533553	Taking pre-orders on Konami style already.
