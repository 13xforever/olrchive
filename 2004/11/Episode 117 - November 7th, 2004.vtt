WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.800
All the time we'll be together

00:03.800 --> 00:06.500
Cause it's yours and mine

00:06.500 --> 00:10.500
Forever we're in this love scene

00:15.500 --> 00:17.500
Now it's me watching you and you're watching me

00:17.500 --> 00:19.500
But I was too blind, I just couldn't see

00:19.500 --> 00:21.500
You were out on the floor, looking so fine

00:21.500 --> 00:23.500
I never really thought I'd ever be blind

00:23.500 --> 00:25.500
But it went on and on and on

00:25.500 --> 00:27.500
I look in on the dance floor and see what's gone

00:27.500 --> 00:29.500
The heart was the one that's the last one to jump

00:29.500 --> 00:31.500
Everybody needs a promise cause of my choice

00:31.500 --> 00:33.500
I can have me close and complete

00:33.500 --> 00:35.500
No longer anybody that I want to see

00:35.500 --> 00:37.500
Will I want to live my life without losing my mind?

00:39.500 --> 00:43.500
Until the day I die

00:43.500 --> 00:46.500
I'll be your everything

00:46.500 --> 00:54.500
And whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

00:54.500 --> 01:03.500

And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting

13:12.860 --> 13:17.860
as they debate some of the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.

13:17.860 --> 13:23.860
Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bamani Music & More program. Can we talk about that?

13:23.860 --> 13:25.860
No subject will ever be taboo.

13:25.860 --> 13:29.860
Well, I was thinking maybe we should move, pump up the volume from Tuesday nights?

13:29.860 --> 13:32.860
Except of course the subject that was just under discussion.

13:32.860 --> 13:38.860
Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?

13:38.860 --> 13:40.860
I collect your fucking head.

13:42.860 --> 13:44.860
Just like this fucker here.

13:46.860 --> 13:48.860
Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki?

13:48.860 --> 13:52.860
The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!

13:53.860 --> 13:55.860
Now if any of you sons of bitches

13:55.860 --> 13:57.860
got anything else to say,

13:57.860 --> 14:00.860
Now's the fucking time!

14:27.860 --> 14:28.860
Three.

14:28.860 --> 14:30.860
Didn't you just say you were sick, Navi?

14:30.860 --> 14:31.860
As of today.

14:31.860 --> 14:32.860
As of this afternoon.

14:32.860 --> 14:33.860
Four.

14:33.860 --> 14:34.860
It's a sick club.

14:34.860 --> 14:39.340
Half the folks in here are in the sick club right now, so I'm a little worried.

14:39.340 --> 14:42.940
I hope we don't catch it, but I think everybody's past contagious stage.

14:42.940 --> 14:47.060
If I exhale hard enough, I can make the raspy voice hot.

14:47.060 --> 14:51.620
I've got the rockin pneumonia and the boogie woogie flu, does that count?

14:51.620 --> 14:52.620
The boogie woogie flu?

14:52.620 --> 14:53.620
It's a song.

14:53.620 --> 14:54.620
Have you ever heard?

14:54.620 --> 14:55.620
No.

14:55.620 --> 14:56.980
I cannot believe you've never heard that song.

14:56.980 --> 15:01.820
Maybe I have heard it and I just forgot it, because it sucked.

15:01.820 --> 15:02.820
I don't know.

15:02.820 --> 15:03.820
It doesn't suck.

15:03.820 --> 15:04.820
Just kidding.

15:04.820 --> 15:05.820
Classic.

15:05.820 --> 15:06.820
Anyway, if you're just joining us, welcome to the show.

15:06.820 --> 15:09.420
We do have a whole lot of special guests here in studio tonight.

15:09.420 --> 15:15.020
Flo walks here, Sharks Girl, Islander, Iguana Girl, Navi, Arcadian42, and then of course

15:15.020 --> 15:17.020
myself, DarkSakura and Loki, all here.

15:17.020 --> 15:19.260
So it's a crowded house.

15:19.260 --> 15:23.660
A good way to come back from episode, or I should say a non-episode, not having a show

15:23.660 --> 15:24.660
for a week.

15:24.660 --> 15:25.660
So it's a good way to come back.

15:25.660 --> 15:29.860
But we're going to start off tonight's show as we start off every week, this week being

15:29.860 --> 15:33.600
no different, and I want to know, how was your week and how was your day?

15:33.600 --> 15:36.740
And also tonight, a bonus question, how was your Halloween?

15:36.740 --> 15:39.700
Jamie, start us off as you always do.

15:39.700 --> 15:43.840
My Halloween, well we did the thing at work and I was wearing these fuzzy leg warmers

15:43.840 --> 15:48.160
and fuzzy arm warmers and had cat ears and a tail, and went around playing with yarn

15:48.160 --> 15:49.820
and blah, that was it.

15:49.820 --> 15:57.040
We had Rocky though on Saturday night, well technically Sunday morning, Saturday night.

15:57.040 --> 15:59.040
And I got to play with lights.

15:59.040 --> 16:01.040
Wow, it sucked.

16:01.040 --> 16:07.900
No, I just, I didn't, I don't think I had enough time to get used to it but it was cool.

16:07.900 --> 16:13.360
And then Halloween, I was just sort of like, dress up, what's that?

16:13.360 --> 16:15.880
And the rest of the week was all busy, busy, busy.

16:15.880 --> 16:24.280
had fun yesterday hanging out. Lots of fun. So, that was it. I kept this one short because

16:24.280 --> 16:28.040
we have a lot of people. I know, wow. I'm shocked. Usually you have like a fifteen minute

16:28.040 --> 16:32.720
monologue. It's amazing. I'm just kidding. Alright, Flo Walk, how you doing? How was

16:32.720 --> 16:35.880
your week? How was your day? How was your Halloween? Let's see, Halloween. Gosh, I really

16:35.880 --> 16:39.920
can't remember much of it because there just really wasn't a bunch of Halloween type stuff

16:39.920 --> 16:45.760
going on. I didn't get a chance to break out my Lucas from the Wizard costume. Aww, I bet

16:45.760 --> 16:52.760
it was so bad. Indeed it was. But uh, let's see, as far as the week goes, gosh man, I

16:52.760 --> 16:56.280
think... I just have to interject though. You went to Classic Gaming Expo, of course

16:56.280 --> 17:00.000
you were there, and I think most, well a few people in this room went to Classic Gaming

17:00.000 --> 17:05.600
Expo. I don't know how many of you guys saw the power glove that was in the room, like

17:05.600 --> 17:09.800
where they were showing all the old stuff. Every time people would walk by it, like every

17:09.800 --> 17:16.760
the other person would go, it's so bad. Myself included. Myself included. Anyway, sorry to

17:16.760 --> 17:23.080
interrupt. It's cool. Let's see, as far as the week goes, gosh, I think I probably speak

17:23.080 --> 17:27.820
like just everyone else. I've probably been sucked up in way too many video games to count.

17:27.820 --> 17:32.260
I mean, Katamari's just been giving me eye strain like a mother. Although, for those

17:32.260 --> 17:35.640
who have played, I don't know if anyone else has gone a perfect 10 meters on the North

17:35.640 --> 17:40.640
I have it! I got it on my second try, I'm a weirdo!

18:05.640 --> 18:11.320
mine, so, hey. And then today is just, of course, you know, always making the track

18:11.320 --> 18:16.560
up from the South Bay up here and jamming to Sirius Radio, which is like the greatest

18:16.560 --> 18:22.540
invention next to the iPod. And here we are now, and it only gets better from here.

18:22.540 --> 18:24.680
Is Sirius the one that's getting Howard Stern?

18:24.680 --> 18:25.680
Yes, it is.

18:25.680 --> 18:26.680
Okay.

18:26.680 --> 18:29.000
I was checking out, because I need to get my car stereo replaced, and I was kind of

18:29.000 --> 18:31.080
thinking about it. Think about it. We'll see.

18:31.080 --> 18:36.580
Sirius went from 600,000 customers to just under a million in less than a month on that

18:36.580 --> 18:37.580
one announcement alone.

18:37.580 --> 18:38.580
Figures.

18:38.580 --> 18:39.580
And I'm one of them.

18:39.580 --> 18:40.580
No surprises.

18:40.580 --> 18:47.780
It would be my dream one day to get this shit on satellite radio, but yeah, I'm not holding

18:47.780 --> 18:50.140
my breath on that one.

18:50.140 --> 18:53.460
But I did see one of those things at Best Buy, it's like a stereo where you can listen

18:53.460 --> 18:55.260
to internet radio like anywhere in your house.

18:55.260 --> 18:58.460
It looked pretty cool, it was $180, but it looked pretty cool.

18:58.460 --> 19:00.780
And hopefully, you know, in about a year, technology comes down.

19:00.780 --> 19:01.780
So, anyway.

19:01.780 --> 19:02.780
Yeah, hi.

19:02.780 --> 19:04.780
Uh, Sharkskull, how was your week?

19:04.780 --> 19:05.780
How was your day?

19:05.780 --> 19:06.780
How was your Halloween?

19:06.780 --> 19:10.300
Um, I don't even remember what I did for Halloween, really.

19:10.300 --> 19:12.140
Is this thing working or no?

19:12.140 --> 19:13.140
It's working.

19:13.140 --> 19:14.940
I just, I'm gonna go back and make sure the audio levels are up sexy.

19:14.940 --> 19:15.940
Okay, cool.

19:15.940 --> 19:17.980
But, um, yeah, I just kinda hung out for Halloween.

19:17.980 --> 19:18.980
It was boring.

19:18.980 --> 19:21.940
Um, avoided little kids, things like that.

19:21.940 --> 19:27.300
Week, I've been sleeping a lot and kind of feeling crappy and, yeah, then we came up

19:27.300 --> 19:32.220
here and I've been all of a sudden my allergies went haaaaaa and now I feel like I'm about

19:32.220 --> 19:39.220
to die. Welcome to Sacramento. Yeah, no kidding. But that's okay. So yeah, it's been fun. It's

19:39.780 --> 19:45.720
just been a day. I sleep a lot nowadays. You went shopping today, right? I bought shoes.

19:45.720 --> 19:49.600
I was a good girl and I only came back with one pair. Are you one of those girls that

19:49.600 --> 19:55.640
has like a hundred pairs of shoes in their closet? Twenty. Well, that's probably average

19:55.640 --> 19:58.820
for a lot of girls I know and the scary thing is I haven't bought any shoes in

19:58.820 --> 20:02.380
like two years and then in like the past probably nine months I bought like ten

20:02.380 --> 20:08.320
pair I get them like all the time people are threatening to call me a melda okay

20:08.320 --> 20:11.380
I'm not even gonna joke with you I'm one of my best friends in high school who I

20:11.380 --> 20:14.600
used to do my public access show with back in the day she had a hundred pairs

20:14.600 --> 20:19.700
of shoes in her closet like there's not enough days in the year to wear all those

20:19.700 --> 20:23.740
have you worn every one of those pairs each one day at least she's like I think

20:23.740 --> 20:27.740
Hey, I went through my shoe stash the other day and I was like, I don't even remember

20:27.740 --> 20:32.740
buying these things. What the hell? These are cute. Now I'm wearing them.

20:32.740 --> 20:38.740
Alright, cool. Alright. Well, let's talk to Islander. Hello. How was your week? How was

20:38.740 --> 20:44.740
your day? How was your Halloween? Um, week's gonna be just fine. Um, the only one who's

20:44.740 --> 20:50.740
like, not sick, thanks to this like, freakishly good immune system. Yeah, like, no seriously,

20:50.740 --> 20:59.740
No seriously, Jessica just shakes her head. As you can see on camera, she's giving me the finger, because I hardly ever get sick, and I don't know why.

20:59.740 --> 21:00.740
It's the RTF jeans.

21:00.740 --> 21:03.740
Thank you. Yeah, it definitely is. It must be the RTF jeans.

21:03.740 --> 21:05.740
That's why it doesn't happen often.

21:05.740 --> 21:16.740
But no, Halloween was basically my day to recover from Rocky. And what was really funny was that after dinner, we went and got some food.

21:16.740 --> 21:30.740
I've seen more and more kids are starting to go to the balls and stuff.

21:46.740 --> 21:52.340
Did I tell you one day I saw the Madden 2005 bus broke down on the side of the road?

21:52.340 --> 21:53.340
Are you serious?

21:53.340 --> 21:54.340
Pretty fucking funny.

21:54.340 --> 21:59.660
On the 680, on the 680, I was driving down, I think it was one time I was coming to see

21:59.660 --> 22:03.260
you one day, Sharkscar, I was driving down 680 and there was the bus broke down on the

22:03.260 --> 22:04.260
side of the road.

22:04.260 --> 22:05.260
I was like, that is hilarious!

22:05.260 --> 22:10.140
I talked about that like weeks ago on Outside the Bus, but yeah, it was crazy.

22:10.140 --> 22:11.140
Funny.

22:11.140 --> 22:12.140
Anyway, let's move on.

22:12.140 --> 22:14.460
And Iguana Girl, welcome back.

22:14.460 --> 22:15.460
Thank you.

22:15.460 --> 22:16.460
It's been a little while.

22:16.460 --> 22:19.460
It's been quite a while since you and I have been on a show together.

22:19.460 --> 22:20.460
Wow.

22:20.460 --> 22:21.460
It's kind of like a reunion.

22:21.460 --> 22:25.300
Oh my god, oh my god, it's 2001 all over again.

22:25.300 --> 22:27.180
I'm glad we can be candid about it, though.

22:27.180 --> 22:28.180
Seriously.

22:28.180 --> 22:29.180
It's good.

22:29.180 --> 22:34.900
I mean, for those who don't know, Guanagirl and I weren't the best of friends for years.

22:34.900 --> 22:35.900
To put it lightly.

22:35.900 --> 22:36.900
Yes.

22:36.900 --> 22:40.380
Which, you know, but, you know, time heals things, and now we're just...

22:40.380 --> 22:44.260
And we've got a bunch of big balls, and we've sucked them up, and...

22:44.260 --> 22:47.260
Yeah, you know, we just, you know, kissed and made up. Well, without the kissing.

22:47.260 --> 22:48.260
Mwah!

22:48.260 --> 22:53.260
And, uh, you know, but it's worked out good, and, you know, everybody always thought there was this big, like,

22:53.260 --> 22:57.260
oh, Orange Lounge versus DDR Freak, because you are the goddess behind DDR Freak Radio.

22:57.260 --> 23:02.260
And everybody's always been like, oh, you know, it's, oh, Orange Lounge versus DDR Freak, and not really.

23:02.260 --> 23:06.260
Yeah, we know, I've been sitting here going, uh, don't I do both?

23:06.260 --> 23:07.260
Yeah.

23:07.260 --> 23:12.260
But no, it's good to have you on, and certainly, if you want to make a plug for DDR Freak Radio, go ahead.

23:12.260 --> 23:20.520
in a DDR3 radio? Because, I think there's, I think there's like, I think there's like,

23:20.520 --> 23:27.280
I think there's 90,000 some odd stations on Live 365. I haven't checked. There are many

23:27.280 --> 23:33.960
more stations that we could pick on besides DDR3 radio. Is the tickling guy a station?

23:33.960 --> 23:38.960
That's what I want to know. Oh my god, the tickling guy. For those that don't know, Guana

23:38.960 --> 23:43.180
I used to do a show way back in the day under sedation live which is still on the air

23:43.180 --> 23:46.780
It just doesn't have us on it anymore, but it's got the very level kind of move to Texas

23:46.780 --> 23:50.160
So you know show when I moved to Texas, but it does have the very lovely

23:51.160 --> 23:53.160
Jenna, I can't remember

23:54.400 --> 24:00.480
Yes, so they still on the air so check them out under station live org and sometimes you can even hear the old episodes have

24:00.480 --> 24:05.800
I've gone a girl and I on them so so we're reunited in our other names mind you

24:05.800 --> 24:12.640
Anyway, enough of that. How was your week? How was your day? How was your Halloween?

24:12.640 --> 24:17.520
My Halloween was, as most other people in this room, or a good portion of the other

24:17.520 --> 24:23.640
people in this room, would be spent at Rocky Horror. I played Columbia, and got to get

24:23.640 --> 24:29.840
all dressed up in all the sequins, and do my hair, and all that fun jazz, and bounce

24:29.840 --> 24:37.480
around and hoped that my top didn't fall off. And then after that Halloween I got cheat

24:37.480 --> 24:43.360
night. I actually got to have, yay, cheat night. Got to go to Old Spaghetti Factory

24:43.360 --> 24:51.200
and eat those nasty carbs and all that fun schnaz. This week unfortunately has been spent

24:51.200 --> 24:59.120
being sick. Sick work school. Sick work school. That's like my mantra this week. So I ended

24:59.120 --> 25:04.860
I'm going to take a couple days off of work, which sucked, and today has been pretty neato

25:04.860 --> 25:05.860
mosquito.

25:05.860 --> 25:08.600
Yesterday was pretty neato mosquito, because I got to spend a lot of time with Ms. Dark

25:08.600 --> 25:13.360
Sakura, and today's been all spiffy, because I get to spend it with everybody else.

25:13.360 --> 25:17.600
So I'm in a relatively good mood, and hopefully I won't be, like, coughing too hard.

25:17.600 --> 25:18.600
All right.

25:18.600 --> 25:20.200
Well, that's okay.

25:20.200 --> 25:23.520
There's only, like, so many mics, so hopefully you won't have the microphone when it's time

25:23.520 --> 25:24.520
to cough.

25:24.520 --> 25:25.520
Anyway, moving on.

25:25.520 --> 25:26.520
Navi.

25:26.520 --> 25:36.200
I'm holding the mic with my sleeve to be courteous to other people because I'm just now breeding

25:36.200 --> 25:38.780
my germs today.

25:38.780 --> 25:39.780
How was your week?

25:39.780 --> 25:40.780
How was your day?

25:40.780 --> 25:41.780
How was your Halloween?

25:41.780 --> 25:42.780
Halloween.

25:42.780 --> 25:43.780
I was at work.

25:43.780 --> 25:44.780
I did nothing.

25:44.780 --> 25:45.780
There was no reason to dress up.

25:45.780 --> 25:46.780
I work in a deli.

25:46.780 --> 25:51.820
I have a costume that smelled like bleach and meat when I come home.

25:51.820 --> 25:55.740
My week, well actually the past couple weeks have just been way too busy for me.

25:55.740 --> 26:00.940
I don't know, shit's been falling apart at work and I've been working like 46, 48 hours

26:00.940 --> 26:01.940
a week.

26:01.940 --> 26:04.940
So I'm actually kind of looking forward to being sick right now, hoping it lands on a

26:04.940 --> 26:06.380
day that I don't have off.

26:06.380 --> 26:07.500
You know what?

26:07.500 --> 26:11.060
Overtime pay rocks though when you've got, and I know you'll be in the import bar, you've

26:11.060 --> 26:12.060
got what?

26:12.060 --> 26:13.060
Eight coming out?

26:13.060 --> 26:14.060
Yeah.

26:14.060 --> 26:15.060
There's crap coming out.

26:15.060 --> 26:19.140
But you know, on my paychecks right now, they're almost double what I normally get.

26:19.140 --> 26:24.860
But all I've been really buying are all my little collectible stuff, but I don't have

26:24.860 --> 26:25.860
any more room.

26:25.860 --> 26:29.860
I don't even have room for the stuff that's coming in the mail this week.

26:29.860 --> 26:34.340
I actually have over $100 left out of my paycheck this week, so I don't know what's going on

26:34.340 --> 26:35.340
with that.

26:35.340 --> 26:36.780
So I'm just going to take some time off and do something.

26:36.780 --> 26:41.020
You've got to tell that cold to hold off about a week, so you can get sick on the 15th of

26:41.020 --> 26:42.020
November.

26:42.020 --> 26:43.020
Yeah.

26:43.020 --> 26:44.020
No, not 18.

26:44.020 --> 26:45.020
I thought that would happen.

26:45.020 --> 26:46.020
No, three days after.

26:46.020 --> 26:47.020
Yeah, sorry.

26:47.020 --> 26:48.020
Or maybe 20 November, around that.

26:48.020 --> 26:53.700
assuming my package gets in the States by, no it can't because the 18th, Friday, yeah,

26:53.700 --> 26:57.620
you know, I, remembering back to how things process when they ship from Japan, actually

26:57.620 --> 26:59.420
it's going to kind of suck because I'll have to wait more days.

26:59.420 --> 27:05.900
You have the science down to a T. Yeah, if it, my ship will ship on any given

27:05.900 --> 27:11.880
damn day, as long as the package gets into the States by Friday, it will ship on a weekend

27:11.880 --> 27:15.140
or a holiday. If not, it like flies around in circles over

27:15.140 --> 27:18.380
Hawaii or something for the weekend and then it gets on San Francisco on Monday and then

27:18.380 --> 27:24.620
it gets processed and whatever but yeah okay so that's my week and then today today was

27:24.620 --> 27:33.940
alright I slept in forever tried playing some 2DX again today and I was having I was having

27:33.940 --> 27:39.680
timing problems when going back to old styles got pissed off went back to play sixth again

27:39.680 --> 27:44.120
and then somehow double-wayed Rotel to Sun, and I'm like, what the hell?

27:44.120 --> 27:45.120
And so yeah.

27:45.120 --> 27:46.120
My gods, he got skills!

27:46.120 --> 27:47.120
Oh my god!

27:47.120 --> 27:52.400
But yeah, you know, but no, I was having cravings to play Dune, and I barely passed Dune.

27:52.400 --> 27:56.840
I was like, I don't remember this being 78 BPMs.

27:56.840 --> 27:59.440
Do you need to upload those scores to VJ Army?

27:59.440 --> 28:00.440
No.

28:00.440 --> 28:02.640
Hey, I'm proud of myself.

28:02.640 --> 28:03.640
Oh my god.

28:03.640 --> 28:04.640
Those are good scores.

28:04.640 --> 28:07.200
I'm just jealous because I haven't touched my 2DX controller or anything.

28:07.200 --> 28:12.200
Don't worry, I'm not going to be bragging on here or anything. That was what I did today.

28:12.200 --> 28:15.200
I sucked at everything else today.

28:15.200 --> 28:17.200
So yeah, I'm ten.

28:17.200 --> 28:20.200
I have to ask something. I actually played seventh style last week.

28:20.200 --> 28:21.200
Did you?

28:21.200 --> 28:22.200
Yay!

28:22.200 --> 28:24.200
So I did do something with the money related.

28:24.200 --> 28:25.200
Well, there you go!

28:25.200 --> 28:27.200
Am I so happy a pop of nine arrived?

28:27.200 --> 28:28.200
Oh, right on.

28:28.200 --> 28:30.200
I haven't played it yet, but I have it.

28:30.200 --> 28:31.200
Pop of nine won.

28:31.200 --> 28:34.200
Oh, you know what? You don't have enough time to unlock everything before ten comes out.

28:34.200 --> 28:36.200
The gambler's easy, bitch.

28:36.200 --> 28:39.180
I don't even know that I'm going to get ten, I just...

28:39.180 --> 28:43.340
Well, it'll take a very, very, very, very long time.

28:43.340 --> 28:46.940
That's quite alright, I don't have a lot of time to play.

28:46.940 --> 28:52.340
Maybe if we find what, you know, where you have to be in the game to let it sit in its place

28:52.340 --> 28:57.300
so the timer will run and count, find that and let it sit on for like, you know, a day.

28:57.300 --> 28:59.040
I like to play the little RPG mode.

28:59.040 --> 29:02.000
You open the chest, you have X song unlocked.

29:02.000 --> 29:02.840
That's kind of cool.

29:02.840 --> 29:07.840
But seriously, it probably took, like, it took, I don't know, whatever, never mind. Okay.

29:07.840 --> 29:14.840
Alright, well then we'll move on. Let's go on to Arkadian42. How was your week? How was your day? How was your Halloween?

29:14.840 --> 29:23.840
For Halloween, I didn't do jack shit. I think I watched, like, Dark City the night before, but I didn't do anything on Halloween.

29:23.840 --> 29:31.840
Next morning I got some candy, but unlike last year, they didn't do the big sale, because it was like Monday instead of, like, a weekend.

29:31.840 --> 29:36.840
Either that or Safeway learned their lesson about people coming in the next day and buying things for like 50 cents.

29:36.840 --> 29:39.840
Said they just did it for half price, so I bought some stuff.

29:39.840 --> 29:48.840
Shared it with work and then worked all week and didn't do much this weekend other than straighten up a little bit and then catch up on message boards.

29:48.840 --> 29:59.840
Then today went to the store and then went to the arcade for a little bit and played one game of Drummania and the symbol was broken.

29:59.840 --> 30:03.920
and one game of Guitar Freaks and that was working alright

30:03.920 --> 30:08.320
and that's all. It's good to know there's still some people in town that actually played

30:08.320 --> 30:08.760
Bomani

30:08.760 --> 30:13.560
It's good to know. Also I wanted to say, because you mentioned the day before Halloween, I just wanted to say

30:13.560 --> 30:15.560
happy late birthday to Navi

30:15.560 --> 30:18.920
and Mel B who both have the same birthday

30:18.920 --> 30:22.720
if you can believe that. Wow. Day before Halloween. Woo.

30:22.720 --> 30:27.000
I'm trying to figure out who's older

30:27.000 --> 30:33.680
Alright, I guess I'll talk about my weekend my day my Halloween actually my Halloween was kind of stupid because I was having relationship issues

30:33.680 --> 30:37.920
So I didn't really have much of a Halloween. I had a talking to on Halloween

30:38.180 --> 30:41.760
There were no treats on Halloween just and they're really not even a trick either

30:44.680 --> 30:46.680
Food yes, there was good food and

30:47.460 --> 30:52.260
Because we had gone to spaghetti factor. I went I went and celebrated cheat day even though every day is cheat day for me

30:52.260 --> 30:57.620
And we got to make fun of the guys in Walgreens. Yeah, that was cool. We made fun of the guys

30:57.620 --> 31:00.020
in Walgreens who were like, I don't know what they were doing. They were hitting on you

31:00.020 --> 31:04.220
or something? I think they were drunk. They were drunk. They were very drunk. But so as

31:04.220 --> 31:07.980
you may have picked up, a lot of folks in the room here, when we're not doing DDR, we're

31:07.980 --> 31:13.060
doing Rocky Horror, so I was involved with all that too. Quite involved with all that.

31:13.060 --> 31:19.460
I hope you don't see the pictures. A lot of girls making threats over there. Hey, I got

31:19.460 --> 31:26.900
pictures of you too, don't push me.

31:26.900 --> 31:31.680
So that was Halloween the day before, and this last week was pretty boring, I got back

31:31.680 --> 31:37.480
into playing Final Fantasy XI, which you know, addict right, I play that quite a bit.

31:37.480 --> 31:41.480
Oh yeah, that was my cue, addict.

31:41.480 --> 31:46.960
And gosh, not a whole lot else going on really, I was watching Loki play Grand Theft Auto

31:46.960 --> 31:51.080
almost a week. I saw The Incredibles last night, which was a cute movie. It was pretty

31:51.080 --> 31:55.440
good. A lot of people are saying it's going to be Oscar. Maybe, I don't know. I like to

31:55.440 --> 32:00.300
kill Bill Vol. 2 a little better, but you know, I just like violence. So that was pretty

32:00.300 --> 32:06.320
much my week. I decided on Saturday, this would be yesterday, that I want to be just

32:06.320 --> 32:11.800
like Tanya, and I'm going to start the DDR diet. So I have to modify my diet a little

32:11.800 --> 32:16.540
bit, because part of my diet is that I want abs, so I'm now doing the DDR-S diet, which

32:16.540 --> 32:21.900
is DDR and sit-ups. So we'll see how that works out. I'll keep you posted on my progress,

32:21.900 --> 32:26.940
but I found that I'm actually playing Max 2 a lot for DDR, even, because nobody's on

32:26.940 --> 32:30.440
UltraMix, like a couple months ago I was playing UltraMix and there would be, you know, sometimes

32:30.440 --> 32:33.820
people on, but I've been kind of pissed off lately because whenever I sign on to UltraMix,

32:33.820 --> 32:38.420
all the games on there are like 8 and 9 footer songs, which is cool and all, and you know,

32:38.420 --> 32:41.820
I can play those once in a while, but I don't like playing them back to back to back for

32:41.820 --> 32:47.500
hour and it really stinks when you're playing against people on a controller so

32:47.500 --> 32:51.180
I'll have to wait for Ultramix 2 to come out so that Xbox Live kind of gets a

32:51.180 --> 32:53.940
swift kick in the ass and you know that gets jump-started again I'll have people

32:53.940 --> 32:57.940
playing it but for the meantime it's all about the mega dance hits non-stop in

32:57.940 --> 33:01.860
Max 2 which has you know my Kylie and Ghost and all that stuff so a lot of fun

33:01.860 --> 33:06.540
and then of course sit-ups I threw my back out yesterday doing it though

33:06.540 --> 33:13.820
cuz a hard lesson learned always stretch before you exercise always stretch how

33:13.820 --> 33:17.980
could I be so stupid I don't know all right I guess you should hear from Loki

33:17.980 --> 33:23.460
as well how was your week how was your day how was your Halloween my week was

33:23.460 --> 33:30.140
alright didn't do much just what did I do this week I don't remember they get

33:30.140 --> 33:36.860
something between Final Fantasy XI and Grand Theft Auto San Andreas. And, um, let's see

33:36.860 --> 33:42.420
what else I did. Oh, we went on our first quote-unquote ghost hunt yesterday. We went

33:42.420 --> 33:49.180
to Coloma for what seemed like hours, but actually it was only like about an hour. And,

33:49.180 --> 33:58.180
um, it was stupid, actually, because, I don't know, it was, it was just walking around a

33:58.180 --> 34:03.780
stupid cemetery and taking pictures of gravestones, and that was just like, eh, whatever, but

34:03.780 --> 34:09.380
it kinda, just, we kinda got a dry run for the whole, um, ghost thingy thing. But anyways,

34:09.380 --> 34:17.180
related to that, I finished the so-called gate to hell device thing, um, I was hoping

34:17.180 --> 34:20.240
to bring it along with me yesterday, but we didn't have a recorder anyway, so that would

34:20.240 --> 34:24.500
have not worked, so, how the fuck is that? But it's done, so that's one project out of

34:24.500 --> 34:30.900
way and other than that I also saw the Incredibles and it was awesome and what

34:30.900 --> 34:37.640
else did I do I don't know Oh Halloween since I was kind of forced to dress up

34:37.640 --> 34:42.780
or I should say persuaded to dress up by my girlfriend I ended up dressing up

34:42.780 --> 34:50.180
like Loki that day ironically left from Dogma so I had a nice coat and wings and

34:50.180 --> 34:56.980
and that was kind of fun. And, I don't know, we just had a party and watched the new Dawn

34:56.980 --> 35:06.260
of the Dead and then Shaun of the Dead. So that was awesome. And that's all I did.

35:06.260 --> 35:10.620
Loki, have you seen that preview for the brand new Mask sequel? You remember the Mask with

35:10.620 --> 35:17.620
Jim Carrey? Oh my God, it looks so lame. But Alan Cumming, who is my God, he's so awesome,

35:17.620 --> 35:20.540
he plays low-key

35:20.540 --> 35:27.060
uh... uh...

35:27.060 --> 35:30.780
uh... i guess we'll do now we're gonna go to another break and then we come back

35:30.780 --> 35:34.380
uh... i want to make some big announcements we have a big announcement to make tonight

35:34.380 --> 35:38.920
uh... regarding a giveaway a really really big giveaway that we're doing

35:38.920 --> 35:42.340
you've heard us talking about it for a while and we even promised it would happen a couple

35:42.340 --> 35:43.300
months ago but it didn't

35:43.300 --> 35:44.080
but that's alright

35:44.080 --> 35:47.560
because it really really is happening soon we actually have a date

35:47.560 --> 35:50.440
We have the prizes in our possession, and if you don't know what we're talking about,

35:50.440 --> 35:53.200
we're going to talk about it when we come back from this break, featuring more of the

35:53.200 --> 35:54.200
UltraMix II V-Rare.

35:54.200 --> 35:58.200
Also tonight, we're going to hear some stuff from 2DX Red at some point.

35:58.200 --> 36:02.280
So in this break, a lot of you guys in the chat room were requesting to hear the Max

36:02.280 --> 36:07.080
300 remix, so we're going to make that happen for you guys, as well as Gyruss, the new Gyruss

36:07.080 --> 36:08.200
mix is awesome.

36:08.200 --> 36:12.860
And then I know there's some fans of Day Behavior too, so we'll throw them in there as well.

36:12.860 --> 36:14.620
So we will be back after this.

36:14.620 --> 36:21.620
listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

37:14.620 --> 37:16.620
Oh

38:14.620 --> 38:43.620
I was picked up for a TV show

38:43.620 --> 38:46.620
It's called A24

38:47.620 --> 38:50.620
I am the girl that you all know

38:50.620 --> 38:53.620
To love, hate, or adore

38:54.620 --> 38:57.620
I've been waiting for my life

38:57.620 --> 39:00.620
Just to be seen

39:00.620 --> 39:03.620
Being by everyone

39:03.620 --> 39:06.620
I wanted to be someone

39:07.620 --> 39:10.620
I'm the student of a star

39:10.620 --> 39:13.620
I'm longing to be seen

39:14.620 --> 39:16.620
I'm back to you

39:17.620 --> 39:20.620
I'll do anything

39:20.620 --> 39:22.620
I'm here

39:39.120 --> 39:41.620
I'm better than a star

39:42.620 --> 39:44.620
Longing to be seen

39:46.120 --> 39:48.120
I'm better than a girl

39:48.120 --> 39:59.120
I'm jumping free, like a superstar, wanting everything

39:59.120 --> 40:08.120
I'll never give up, I'll do anything you need

41:29.120 --> 41:58.920
Hi ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

41:58.920 --> 42:03.920
is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

42:03.920 --> 42:08.920
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

42:08.920 --> 42:10.920
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

42:10.920 --> 42:14.920
We are live here on this lovely Sunday evening, as we are every Sunday night.

42:14.920 --> 42:17.920
This is a big week for those of you guys that are Xbox fans.

42:17.920 --> 42:21.920
I know a lot of you guys have Xbox. Huge game coming out Tuesday.

42:21.920 --> 42:24.920
Biggest release. I know you've been waiting for it all year long.

42:24.920 --> 42:32.480
karaoke revolutions coming out for Xbox on Tuesday I know you can't wait for it

42:32.480 --> 42:36.140
so I know and I hear that folks are gonna be lining up around the corner at

42:36.140 --> 42:40.600
midnight to buy this game so it's pretty crazy but just you know don't riot

42:40.600 --> 42:44.920
please let's say orderly there's enough karaoke revolution for everyone I hear

42:44.920 --> 42:48.560
that they expect that there could be extra copies on the shelves just a

42:48.560 --> 42:55.560
couple no but seriously karaoke revolution what the hell it came out of

42:55.560 --> 42:59.680
nowhere like I know we were talking about karaoke revolution Xbox a couple

42:59.680 --> 43:03.560
weeks ago on the show and then suddenly I remember iguana girl made a post in

43:03.560 --> 43:06.000
her live journal she was actually talking about karaoke revolution volume

43:06.000 --> 43:10.580
three yeah because you know a go on a girl and I have been known to do some

43:10.580 --> 43:14.800
karaoke and one of the songs that's being featured happens to be something

43:14.800 --> 43:19.320
that both Sky and I used to do on a semi-regular basis.

43:19.320 --> 43:22.600
Back when we actually spoke.

43:22.600 --> 43:29.800
And for those that are really interested, there is a file on the Internet that you can

43:29.800 --> 43:38.280
find somewhere at a particular convention that a particular Sky and I went to.

43:38.280 --> 43:39.840
Actually that was when we first played DDR.

43:39.840 --> 43:42.280
That was the same weekend that we first played DDR.

43:42.280 --> 43:45.920
So if you want to see what I look like the first time I play DDR with this hideous zit

43:45.920 --> 43:46.920
right on my nose.

43:46.920 --> 43:47.920
The hideous face!

43:47.920 --> 43:48.920
The hideous face!

43:48.920 --> 43:51.920
Oh my god, the face!

43:51.920 --> 43:58.600
But yeah, if you're, if you're, uh, coos enough to be able to find it, then, you know, that

43:58.600 --> 44:00.680
file is still out there on the internet as far as I know.

44:00.680 --> 44:04.160
Just think about what, now, Pop Quiz, you guys, think about what Iguana Girl and I talked

44:04.160 --> 44:06.680
about during the last little banter session, okay?

44:06.680 --> 44:08.320
So you might be able to find it.

44:08.320 --> 44:09.320
Yeah.

44:09.320 --> 44:16.680
Alright, so anyway, iguanagirl posted kref3, pointed out the fact that there was love shack.

44:16.680 --> 44:21.180
And I knew, I had heard the karaoke revolution 3 had duets, and I even remember looking at

44:21.180 --> 44:24.940
an early song list, but I just kind of skimmed it because there were so many songs, I don't

44:24.940 --> 44:28.260
even remember connecting it, oh my god, love shack was in it, because maybe at the time

44:28.260 --> 44:34.160
I didn't care either, I don't know, but, oh my god, that love shack crap, oh I don't want

44:34.160 --> 44:46.160
I was surprised that the website didn't have a date, so I was like, okay, I'm going to

44:46.160 --> 44:47.800
go find a date for when this game comes out.

44:47.800 --> 44:52.680
I go to GameFacts.com, because Go On A Girl said, well, you spent your majority of E3

44:52.680 --> 44:53.680
this year.

44:53.680 --> 44:55.240
In the Karaoke Revolution 2 booth.

44:55.240 --> 44:56.240
Yes, exactly.

44:56.240 --> 44:59.680
Because, you know, they had a nice little seat, and it was air conditioned, and I liked

44:59.680 --> 45:00.680
to sing.

45:00.680 --> 45:01.680
They had the little Logitech microphones.

45:01.680 --> 45:02.680
It was fun.

45:02.680 --> 45:08.880
So it was assumed that, okay, well we'll get to try this out next May, but I was kind of

45:08.880 --> 45:13.680
going, I don't know, it just seems like, you know, to put out the song, six months to wait

45:13.680 --> 45:14.680
for that, I don't know.

45:14.680 --> 45:18.160
So I decided to look for a street date, and sure enough, gamefacts.com, I bring it up,

45:18.160 --> 45:20.320
says 11-9, the street date.

45:20.320 --> 45:22.160
I'm like, is Xbox coming out the same day?

45:22.160 --> 45:26.580
Sure enough, Karaoke Revolution Xbox, 11-9, a date you guys might have heard of for certain

45:26.580 --> 45:28.640
releases of certain games.

45:28.640 --> 45:30.280
Yes.

45:30.280 --> 45:32.200
So I have no idea where the hell this is coming from.

45:32.200 --> 45:36.440
Do you have any idea, Mel? I know you have some of the inside scoop at Konami, but do

45:36.440 --> 45:39.400
you have any idea how the hell this just blindsided us all?

45:39.400 --> 45:45.640
I think what it all boils down to is it just makes marketing sense. I mean, KR1 did really

45:45.640 --> 45:50.040
well, KR2, you know, followed up pretty nicely, and hey, it's holiday season. Why not milk

45:50.040 --> 45:53.000
the product for what it's worth, really? I think that's what it boils down to.

45:53.000 --> 45:56.560
Well, I don't think it's any surprise that we're getting a Karaoke Revolution 3 and Duet's

45:56.560 --> 46:02.280
logical next step in the right direction, but that was fast.

46:02.280 --> 46:06.880
It's really wasn't that hard to, you know, I mean, one and two were pretty much not that

46:06.880 --> 46:12.600
different, you know, aside from just one extra in the mode. And it's pretty safe to say after

46:12.600 --> 46:17.000
they did like KR1, they had already been working on KR3 because it's really just kind of like

46:17.000 --> 46:21.120
drop this in and, you know, it's, you just kind of add on top as opposed to redoing a

46:21.120 --> 46:24.760
whole new engine. Yeah, I mean, it pretty much looks the same,

46:24.760 --> 46:28.760
but now you got duets which is kind of cool so now you guys all out there in

46:28.760 --> 46:33.880
Radio Land will have to find a friend to play this game with and just please go

46:33.880 --> 46:39.400
out and find a friend please no please just in fact just for the sake of having

46:39.400 --> 46:43.420
a life go for not kidding um but this is good because now I want a girl and I can

46:43.420 --> 46:47.540
practice for you know because you know someday at our favorite bar they have to

46:47.540 --> 46:52.920
do a duets contest someday it's got to happen we need to talk to our favorite

46:52.920 --> 46:58.240
KJ about making that happen. So we've got to win that. So we can spend the money on

46:58.240 --> 47:04.600
games. Because I'm going to be fucking broke after November, I don't know about you guys.

47:04.600 --> 47:07.400
Quick poll, going around the room. Games you're looking forward to by the end of the year?

47:07.400 --> 47:10.040
It doesn't have to be Bobbani, just any games you're looking forward to by the end of the

47:10.040 --> 47:15.440
year? Oh man, there's still more stuff out there. I don't know, it's kind of hard to

47:15.440 --> 47:18.960
say. Well obviously, yeah, you know, the 8 styles is definitely the one I'm looking forward

47:18.960 --> 47:24.960
And I'm still looking forward to Rumble Roses. That's going to be pretty dope.

47:24.960 --> 47:27.960
Yeah, that does come out Tuesday awesome.

47:27.960 --> 47:31.960
It seems like most of the games I'm looking forward to have already come out.

47:31.960 --> 47:34.960
And it's like, you know what, I need to look forward to more, man.

47:34.960 --> 47:36.960
I'm still catching up on like three or four more games.

47:36.960 --> 47:39.960
You know, it's like maybe by March, you know, I'll be caught up.

47:39.960 --> 47:45.960
And then by that time E3 rolls around and it's like, great, more anticipation, you know, in May and so on and so on.

47:45.960 --> 47:58.960
But I figured they're just kind of blowing everything out now, because once next-gen systems come out, you know, obviously, those first launch titles usually kind of blow ass, and, you know, but, uh, yeah, I think Roam of Roses right now is definitely high on my list.

47:58.960 --> 48:00.960
Sounds good. Sharkskull, anything you're looking forward to?

48:00.960 --> 48:09.960
Right now, it's mostly, like, UltraMix 2 and, um, 8th Style, because I've got all this stuff. I just got Donkey Konga a month or two ago.

48:09.960 --> 48:10.960
Ooh, how was that?

48:10.960 --> 48:11.960
Oh, I love that game.

48:11.960 --> 48:16.720
love that game. We didn't get a chance to pick it up for the show here. That Tycho we completely missed. I am so freaking addicted to it.

48:16.720 --> 48:21.000
I just sit there and just bop away. My mom's like, what the hell are you doing? I'm like, I'm playing Conga, leave me alone.

48:21.000 --> 48:25.720
Um, and my friend from Nashville, Cincinnati, everywhere just came back and

48:25.720 --> 48:28.320
he's got it too, so I found someone I could play with.

48:28.320 --> 48:32.080
I might have to buy this too before the next time I visit. It's fun. We'll drive your mom

48:32.080 --> 48:37.360
crazy. It's a lot of fun, but um, yeah, you know, I got that. I just got Burnout 3, I got

48:37.360 --> 48:38.760
Star Wars Battlefront,

48:38.760 --> 48:43.760
I got Katamari Damacy, I'm just catching up to everything I've just bought recently, and Dr. Mario.

48:43.760 --> 48:48.760
The freaking crack game from way back.

48:48.760 --> 48:53.760
So yeah, I'm just catching up to what I already bought. For the most part.

48:53.760 --> 48:54.760
Sounds good.

48:54.760 --> 48:56.760
Uh, Islander, what are you looking forward to?

48:56.760 --> 48:59.760
Uh, like Mel, I'm looking forward to Rumble Roses.

48:59.760 --> 49:05.760
Um, pretty much everything that I'm looking forward to is already, has already been released.

49:05.760 --> 49:15.760
There's a lot of things I still need to pick up. Probably like, for example, MK Deception. I still want to pick up just for MK1.

49:15.760 --> 49:20.760
You have to get the collector's edition for MK1 though, just so you know. Because I bought Deception, but it doesn't have MK1 on it.

49:20.760 --> 49:29.760
Yeah, okay. So yeah, I know about that. Other than that, there's a few others, but recently we just picked up, you know, of course we have Extreme, Katamari Damacy,

49:29.760 --> 49:36.600
Mad 2005 for me, and Smackdown Reservoir for myself, and between those four games, I mean,

49:36.600 --> 49:41.720
there's still stuff on Extreme that I haven't unlocked yet. I mean, because I've got so

49:41.720 --> 49:46.000
much stuff to play, so most of the stuff I've been looking for has already been released,

49:46.000 --> 49:50.120
so I just need to, you know, just kind of save up for them.

49:50.120 --> 49:53.680
Right on. Iguana Girl, what are you looking forward to?

49:53.680 --> 49:58.400
Well, I would officially like to start the Iguana Girl Really Needs New Games Fund, because

49:58.400 --> 50:02.120
I am too damn broke to be able to afford anything.

50:02.120 --> 50:06.520
I would really, really love to be able to get A-Style, but first I'd love to get 7-Style,

50:06.520 --> 50:07.520
a new controller.

50:07.520 --> 50:08.520
I hear you.

50:08.520 --> 50:13.360
It's kind of helpful to have a controller that functions.

50:13.360 --> 50:17.340
Do you have a PayPal you want to plug?

50:17.340 --> 50:19.440
If I could remember the name, I would.

50:19.440 --> 50:26.340
But yeah, I'm incredibly broke in trying to make ends meet, but almost out of debt type

50:26.340 --> 50:27.340
of deal.

50:27.340 --> 50:32.860
So yeah, I would love to get 8 style, I would love to get 7 style still, and I would love

50:32.860 --> 50:37.020
to get an Xbox to be able to play the Xbox versions of games.

50:37.020 --> 50:41.780
And also, of course, you know, because I'm a karaoke horror, karaoke revolution 3.

50:41.780 --> 50:42.780
Very cool.

50:42.780 --> 50:43.780
Navi.

50:43.780 --> 50:46.720
And I bet you not a single one of his games are going to be domestic.

50:46.720 --> 50:47.720
Actually yeah.

50:47.720 --> 50:54.340
Well, I mean, as far as ones that have yet to be released, I still want to play Deception

50:54.340 --> 50:58.940
and San Andreas, but just haven't really gotten around to it.

50:58.940 --> 51:05.980
I am so looking forward to getting my Ellie's for 8th Style and Pop and Music 10.

51:05.980 --> 51:10.900
As far as the future, I'm thinking about picking up the new Taeko no Tatsujin game.

51:10.900 --> 51:13.100
It's actually the song list I saw.

51:13.100 --> 51:16.940
There's like random ass licensed songs in there that I know.

51:16.940 --> 51:19.820
All these like, you know, Karaoke Revolution and all these other games that incorporate

51:19.820 --> 51:24.780
any music in it they're all crossing over with each other like like choo-choo train

51:24.780 --> 51:33.580
is in it and stuff um and any interest in the u.s version at all probably not i don't

51:33.580 --> 51:40.120
know i haven't i haven't checked out any song listings for that yet though um but god what

51:40.120 --> 51:46.260
else was there supposedly the sequel to karatemanidamashi is still supposed to be out before the year's

51:46.260 --> 51:56.820
over. The Japanese one came out like in February. They haven't given a release date on it, they're

51:56.820 --> 52:00.040
being all super secretive on it, but I think it still says it's supposed to be out before

52:00.040 --> 52:05.300
the end of the year. And then I think I'm going to go get one of those Dragon Warrior

52:05.300 --> 52:09.480
slime controllers. Those are so cute. What site can they go to

52:09.480 --> 52:12.940
to check those out? Actually, they're now up for pre-order. I

52:12.940 --> 52:19.940
I just checked last night. They're up for pre-orders at NCSX and Japan Video Games and they're $45.

52:19.940 --> 52:22.940
Arkadian.

52:22.940 --> 52:26.940
I think the only thing I'd be anticipating would be 8th style.

52:26.940 --> 52:31.940
There's so many songs I like in that style.

52:31.940 --> 52:34.940
Even though I haven't played 7th style in months.

52:34.940 --> 52:38.940
Mainly because I do typing and stuff all day.

52:38.940 --> 52:45.780
kinda hard to do more stuff with my hands. Nothing really else because I hardly follow

52:45.780 --> 52:46.780
games anymore.

52:46.780 --> 52:49.660
Aww, well that's alright.

52:49.660 --> 52:55.540
With like all old systems and only Japanese PS2 and that's pretty much it.

52:55.540 --> 52:59.660
I haven't touched my Japanese PS2 in months. It feels so neglected it's crying in my room

52:59.660 --> 53:01.180
under the pile of laundry it's under.

53:01.180 --> 53:03.860
Let's go nuzzle it.

53:03.860 --> 53:07.540
I need to cuddle with it tonight and let it know I still love it. I just, you know, have

53:07.540 --> 53:14.540
no use for it. There's some rejection. Poor thing's going to go crying off to the Xbox

53:15.140 --> 53:22.140
now. Oh my god, my JPS2 is going to elope with my GameCube. Ever since Josh and I stopped

53:24.220 --> 53:28.020
playing Four Swords, I haven't touched the GameCube either. They're going to elope. They

53:28.020 --> 53:35.020
do get the GS2. Dark Sacra, what are you looking forward to this holiday? Definitely Ape Style,

53:35.020 --> 53:41.020
8th style, which I actually have to go and play Asia and make my pre-order.

53:41.020 --> 53:46.320
Actually, I know for sure I'm getting the Taiko no Tatujin US one, because Dan basically

53:46.320 --> 53:50.220
slipped and told me he's getting it for me. Although he made an interesting slip, something

53:50.220 --> 53:53.540
about an arcade-style controller, but for 2DX.

53:53.540 --> 53:54.540
Ooh!

53:54.540 --> 53:58.260
Because we were talking about expensive presents, and that's what...

53:58.260 --> 54:01.300
Jamie's favorite kind, for those listening, by the way.

54:01.300 --> 54:03.900
Yeah, it doesn't matter what it is you're shopping for.

54:03.900 --> 54:08.900
I don't really think I'm going to get it, but I was talking about a $400 set of

54:08.900 --> 54:13.900
Copic Markers that I wanted. They had it at A1 Comics and I was like, I really want

54:13.900 --> 54:17.900
this, but I would rather have a tablet because I wanted a nice big art tablet.

54:17.900 --> 54:21.900
He was like, well, you could get that or you could get an arcade style controller,

54:21.900 --> 54:25.900
and then he didn't say anything else. So I was like, ooh.

54:25.900 --> 54:30.900
Very interesting. Very. Although, honestly, I want to try actually building one.

54:30.900 --> 54:35.740
Yeah, and I haven't seen any place now that has 2DX arcade-style controllers for anything

54:35.740 --> 54:36.740
less than $500 now.

54:36.740 --> 54:38.660
Wasn't there a third-party that was making one, though?

54:38.660 --> 54:39.660
Huh?

54:39.660 --> 54:40.660
Wasn't there a third-party that was getting one?

54:40.660 --> 54:41.660
I don't know about that.

54:41.660 --> 54:44.900
There's tons of third-parties for pop and music arcade-style controllers, and they're

54:44.900 --> 54:48.980
only like $250, but yeah, they've gone up like $150 since I got mine.

54:48.980 --> 54:52.060
So I could just make one.

54:52.060 --> 54:58.460
I found all the schematics to make one myself, so I could do it if I had time.

54:58.460 --> 55:04.960
But as far as any other game, I definitely want Katamari Damacy 2.

55:04.960 --> 55:08.960
I'm sort of in about DDR right now, just because I'm so busy with everything else, I don't

55:08.960 --> 55:11.700
really have time to play.

55:11.700 --> 55:15.920
I was actually thinking about getting the DDR aerobics game, though.

55:15.920 --> 55:16.920
Cute.

55:16.920 --> 55:18.720
What was it?

55:18.720 --> 55:21.720
I remember it was Aerobic Revolution or something, yeah.

55:21.720 --> 55:23.800
I was thinking about it.

55:23.800 --> 55:26.000
We heard it was coming out, and then we didn't hear anything else.

55:26.000 --> 55:29.180
The game I want, though, it's already came out in the US, but it's really crappy.

55:29.180 --> 55:32.460
So I need to import Bujingai.

55:32.460 --> 55:35.180
It's the game with Gakda as the main character.

55:35.180 --> 55:39.240
Now somebody had sent me a link about this, that Gakda was doing a voice, I think Dark

55:39.240 --> 55:40.240
Knight was telling me about this.

55:40.240 --> 55:41.240
He's the whole character model.

55:41.240 --> 55:42.240
That's awesome.

55:42.240 --> 55:47.800
The game, it was, in fact I put pictures in my live journal way back when, you know, when

55:47.800 --> 55:52.880
they were actually in production of the game, but it just looked really, really awesome

55:52.880 --> 55:56.520
and I heard that they really, really butchered it for the U.S., but now the import's gonna

55:56.520 --> 55:58.760
be cheap since the U.S. version is out.

55:58.760 --> 55:59.760
Oh, okay.

55:59.760 --> 56:02.720
A lot of the importers should have it really cheap, but I have to go around, jumping around

56:02.720 --> 56:05.320
from, you know, building to building is gawked.

56:05.320 --> 56:06.320
Gawk didn't have to...

56:06.320 --> 56:07.320
And all this fabulousness.

56:07.320 --> 56:09.200
He didn't have to speak in English for the English one, did he?

56:09.200 --> 56:10.760
No, they probably got somebody else.

56:10.760 --> 56:11.760
I don't...

56:11.760 --> 56:12.760
Ooh, that'd be weird.

56:12.760 --> 56:13.760
I know.

56:13.760 --> 56:16.080
I was like, I can't hear another voice with that.

56:16.080 --> 56:19.880
I have to have his, you know, voice.

56:19.880 --> 56:20.880
It just doesn't...

56:20.880 --> 56:21.880
I wouldn't be right.

56:21.880 --> 56:23.880
All right, anything else?

56:23.880 --> 56:26.880
Um, hopefully a game where I can shoot things.

56:26.880 --> 56:28.880
Right on.

56:28.880 --> 56:33.880
Um, as far as my top three games for this holiday season, I would say number three is

56:33.880 --> 56:38.880
a tie, um, 2DXA style I gotta get. I know it's gonna get me back into 2DX, which I'm

56:38.880 --> 56:43.880
sure makes Navi, yeah, he's grinning over there, cause he missed, I guess I suck now

56:43.880 --> 56:46.880
and it used to be like Navi and I would have little friendly competitions about, you know,

56:46.880 --> 56:49.880
who can beat this song first, and then at one point I just said, ah, fuck it, you beat

56:49.880 --> 56:53.600
you know, and I just kind of quit 2DX, but I think 8 style might get me back into it

56:53.600 --> 56:59.500
a little bit, but it's kind of a tie because Rumble Roses, I really want it, and this is

56:59.500 --> 57:03.080
strange because, and this is no secret to those of you who listen to the show, I'm a

57:03.080 --> 57:09.020
gay guy, but... Since when did you turn straight? I, I, you know what, it's hilarious, I mean

57:09.020 --> 57:14.520
the thought of women kicking the shit out of each other in mud wrestling, to Bamani

57:14.520 --> 57:19.360
music stuff, type stuff, because the artists are doing it, it's hilarious to me. Well,

57:19.360 --> 57:23.360
I mean, jeez, I'm a straight chick, and I love playing DOA, Extreme Beach Volleyball,

57:23.360 --> 57:25.860
and putting them in the tiniest little freaking bikinis I could find.

57:25.860 --> 57:26.560
Exactly.

57:26.560 --> 57:27.360
I do it all the time.

57:27.360 --> 57:30.960
There's something about being able to, uh, kick the shit out of, you know,

57:30.960 --> 57:34.560
or become a woman that can kick the shit out of everybody, it's...

57:34.560 --> 57:35.560
I don't know.

57:35.560 --> 57:39.060
No, and I'm not one of those, like, transsexual whatevers, okay?

57:39.060 --> 57:40.960
I just... think it's fun.

57:40.960 --> 57:45.460
Then after they've slowly beat each other to, um, submission in the mud,

57:45.460 --> 57:52.460
They slowly strip off the clothes and go at it in a very aggressive, sexual, uh, yeah.

57:52.460 --> 57:54.460
Rob is out without power.

57:54.460 --> 57:55.460
I need a towel.

57:55.460 --> 57:58.460
No, um, go power!

57:58.460 --> 58:07.460
Before we get too far away from it, the third party, um, controllers I was thinking about for 2DX would be Controlica, which is a new site that's actually come out.

58:07.460 --> 58:12.220
They're going to be selling supposedly in the winter 2DX arcade style controllers that

58:12.220 --> 58:18.060
are supposed to be on par or if not better for $375 plus shipping and based on their

58:18.060 --> 58:21.980
pop music controller which looks just like an arcade style controller, all metal, really

58:21.980 --> 58:22.980
nice.

58:22.980 --> 58:24.780
It should be pretty good.

58:24.780 --> 58:25.780
Very nice.

58:25.780 --> 58:26.780
All right.

58:26.780 --> 58:28.100
Thank you for interrupting me.

58:28.100 --> 58:29.100
That's all right.

58:29.100 --> 58:30.100
It's good to know.

58:30.100 --> 58:32.900
I was wondering what that site was because you're showing it to me earlier this week.

58:32.900 --> 58:33.900
I forgot.

58:33.900 --> 58:39.180
As far as my number two, and try not to boo me for this, but I really do want this game.

58:39.180 --> 58:42.820
I haven't even said what it is yet.

58:42.820 --> 58:44.580
I want Halo 2 really bad.

58:44.580 --> 58:46.580
Me too, oh my god, me too.

58:46.580 --> 58:49.500
And we can play online and I can run over you with the Warthog.

58:49.500 --> 58:53.260
Well this is the thing, okay, you guys have to understand, that back when I was in college,

58:53.260 --> 58:56.060
my buddies at Sonoma State, I had a bunch of friends that went to Sonoma State over

58:56.060 --> 58:59.540
in the Bay, and they all had a really fast internet connection, so they would set up

58:59.540 --> 59:03.060
Quake servers, and I used to get on there and school them at Quake.

59:03.060 --> 59:05.660
I was really good don't don't listen to him. I was the best at quake

59:05.660 --> 59:05.960
Okay

59:05.960 --> 59:11.940
And so now the halo twos out and it's on Xbox live like everybody that was in college that little circle friends in college

59:11.940 --> 59:17.240
They have an Xbox. They're all getting Xbox live. So it's like we're gonna relive the old days through halo 2. It's so precious

59:17.600 --> 59:22.580
So yeah, I really really want halo 2 so shut up. Don't hate. Why do you suck now shut

59:24.120 --> 59:26.120
Cuz he's gay, duh

59:27.340 --> 59:29.860
Now I remember why we haven't had you on the show any here

59:29.860 --> 59:36.760
I'm just kidding. And then my number one, absolutely DDR Ultramix 2. I believe it's

59:36.760 --> 59:40.180
going to live up to the hype. I think it's going to be awesome. I have no doubt it's

59:40.180 --> 59:46.360
going to be a Bomani fan's wet dream this winter, so I'm looking forward to it, definitely.

59:46.360 --> 59:49.480
And I'm also looking forward to being able to play, and Seagurd has already accepted

59:49.480 --> 59:54.560
this challenge, I'm going to play Seagurd on this show, live, and beat him at his own

59:54.560 --> 59:59.320
own steps. That's the challenge that's on the table right now. Are you listening? You

59:59.320 --> 01:00:07.440
listening? It's own. It's already been brought in. All right. Okay, was that everybody? Loki,

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:14.960
I didn't get your top three. What are you looking forward to this holiday season? Gimme.

01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:21.600
I don't know if this is coming out within this time frame, but Alien Hominid. I don't

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:26.680
though. I don't pay attention to this shit. God. So that one looked really awesome.

01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:30.360
Dude, did I tell you about that last time I was here, though?

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:33.240
Nope. Oh, yeah, you mentioned it, but then wasn't

01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:38.280
it like your friend or something? Yeah, my friend James, his friend is the

01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:40.280
one who designed it. Looks awesome.

01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:46.040
Yes. So that one would be cool. Oh, gosh. Really,

01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:50.960
as far as video games, I'm not looking forward to anything, to be honest. Really, E3, I was

01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:56.520
just kind of eh, you know, so no, there's not really anything I'm looking forward to

01:00:56.520 --> 01:01:04.440
at all. No, I can't think of anything. Unless, well, well.

01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:08.880
You know what? You got Grand Theft Auto San Andreas and you can beat cops senseless with

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:11.520
your pimp cane. I don't know if there's anything else that really you need.

01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:16.960
They could always have a Driver 4 so that I could see even worse AI.

01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:20.320
Wow. Oh my God, that game sucks.

01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:24.320
I just, the only reason I play is just to see how bad it sucks.

01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:30.320
And, you know, it's, it's great. And it's funny though, because in Grand Theft Auto San Andreas,

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:36.320
there's a point in the game where you have to go into this rapper's house and like steal like his rhyme book,

01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:42.320
and he's playing Driver 3 and seeing how bad it sucks when you walk by him. It's great.

01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:48.320
But anyways, um, no, really, um, oh yeah, the other thing I'm really looking forward to,

01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:53.320
And hopefully they'll get it out by, you know, winter, you know, 2004. It's in the groove, the home version.

01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:58.320
Dot, dot, dot.

01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:04.320
No, actually, I don't care. But, um, I would like to see, um, Pump It Up exceed.

01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:05.320
Yeah.

01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:06.320
I would like to see that.

01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:07.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it looks interesting.

01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:12.320
You know, I don't play Pump It Up and I despise the arcade. I'd still like to see it because it'd be something different.

01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:24.320
And, um... God, you know, um... I don't know, all the good games have already come out. Like, most of the Konami ones are already out, so...

01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:34.320
Well, you know, I don't know, I can't think of any good ones. I guess Metal Gear Solid 3, but I don't like even playing Metal Gear Solid 3, or Solid or Solid 2, so...

01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:40.320
I don't know. The DS, I guess? I don't know. That might be pretty cool.

01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:46.320
So they can start re-releasing. Oh! A new Animal Crossing game, if that ever comes out.

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:49.320
Animal Crossing DS would be cool.

01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:53.320
You know, these are those times when I'm very grateful that my man works where he does.

01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:55.320
So I can get my free DS.

01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:59.320
Absolutely. Hey, have you gotten a copy of the Ultramix 2V Rare through them yet?

01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:01.320
He's got it. He just hasn't brought it home for me yet.

01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:06.620
Hmm, interesting. I know those are hitting the shelves, so if you haven't found yours yet, go- go bug your local GameStop.

01:03:07.820 --> 01:03:11.920
It's great. It's a great CD. I mean, even if it wasn't even DDR-related, it's still a great CD.

01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:18.620
And I think it is just awesome that for the first time we have full-length versions of songs that weren't done by Konami. That's pretty cool.

01:03:18.620 --> 01:03:22.220
I mean, not that Konami songs are bad, don't get me wrong, but it's just neat to have other stuff on there, so...

01:03:22.420 --> 01:03:23.420
Check it out if you haven't yet.

01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:29.140
Konami bringing on a different drum is probably the smartest thing they could have done for

01:03:29.140 --> 01:03:34.180
both a different drum and themselves. Definitely. Yeah, I don't know if you guys noticed this,

01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:39.740
but, and this is out in the UltraMix 2 thread over on The Freak right now, so there's no

01:03:39.740 --> 01:03:46.000
secret, but that Alien C16, whatever the guy's name, his website says that he has certain

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:50.340
songs that were in UltraMix 2. TOY, if you go to his site, his site says there are certain

01:03:50.340 --> 01:03:55.360
songs in Ultramix 2. If you just thought to go to a different drums website and look at

01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:58.980
all the links to the artist pages, if you were really bored, you would have known about

01:03:58.980 --> 01:04:05.300
that stuff months ago. But, c'est la vie. It was a fun secret while it lasted, I guess.

01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:13.300
Who knows? Anyway, let's see. Well, okay, I want to talk about some things that are

01:04:13.300 --> 01:04:16.900
going to be coming up on the station. Obviously, I teased this. We've got a contest that's

01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:21.380
going to be coming up and Floatwalk, you were a big part of helping hook us up with this.

01:04:21.380 --> 01:04:23.640
I'm actually going to, if you don't mind, Dark Seqra, I'm going to bring up the cam

01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:26.740
for a minute because I want to put these on the cam real fast, but let us know about it.

01:04:26.740 --> 01:04:29.980
We talked about it on the station a little bit before, but remind us again, Floatwalk,

01:04:29.980 --> 01:04:32.380
what are we doing with our buddies at DDR Spot right now?

01:04:32.380 --> 01:04:38.100
Well, DDR Spot, for those who actually come visit us once in a while, we'll reward you

01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:44.000
because roughly around next week or so, we're going to relaunch basically another version

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:49.880
And obviously it's gonna be more or less coinciding with UltraMix 2 coming out and such, but Orange

01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:54.760
Lounge is doing a giveaway, as are we, and we're doing the same gifts actually, which

01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:56.720
I have brought up finally.

01:04:56.720 --> 01:05:01.400
As you know, of course me being the man and all that kind of stuff, I got my hookups here

01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:08.280
and there, and those in Orange Lounge, I know a bunch of y'all are Kira Yamaoka fans, so

01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:15.160
We got four of his promotional CDs, which are actually like little mini CDs, which have,

01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:20.720
I believe one of them is the, what's that song, Room of Angel I guess it is, yeah, it

01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:23.600
has that and then it has like a spoken track on it afterwards.

01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:31.320
It was kind of a promotional giveaway in Japan and he has autographed all four CDs, so those

01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:41.240
who want to get a piece of the man, they are more than welcome to try. But let's see what

01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:47.580
else is going on. Yeah, that's our big giveaway for the time being. There's probably more

01:05:47.580 --> 01:05:50.300
we might have in the future, but be grateful for what you have.

01:05:50.300 --> 01:05:56.900
So this is the way the contest is going to work, boys and girls. We're going to start

01:05:56.900 --> 01:06:01.860
this contest on... I got to bring up the calendar because I forgot. It's not tomorrow, but a

01:06:01.860 --> 01:06:05.460
week from tomorrow. November 15th is when this contest is going to start. It's going

01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:11.940
to run for two weeks. Here's the deal. Monday nights, Tuesday nights, and Thursday nights,

01:06:11.940 --> 01:06:15.700
Orange Launch Radio have certain spin-off programs. You might have heard of these. Diversion

01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:20.260
on Mondays, pump up the volume on Tuesday, and Outside the Box, moving to Thursday nights

01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:25.060
this week. So starting on the 15th, on each one of these shows, we're going to ask a trivia

01:06:25.060 --> 01:06:29.060
Something about a Kiryamoka, something about Silent Hill, won't be too difficult, but you

01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:31.460
know, my challenge, you might have to do a little research.

01:06:31.460 --> 01:06:33.940
We're going to ask you a question on each one of these shows.

01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:37.200
Then for each week, because we have two CDs, we're going to be doing this for two weeks,

01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:40.940
at the end of each week we'll take all the emails with the correct answers and we'll

01:06:40.940 --> 01:06:46.300
be drawing one randomly and whoever gets all the answers correct and we pull them randomly

01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:51.940
out of the hat, they win a signed Kiryamoka Silent Hill 4 limited edition CD.

01:06:51.940 --> 01:06:56.260
imported from Japan, worth a lot of money doing a Kiryamoka collector, you got to

01:06:56.260 --> 01:07:00.400
have this. So definitely be tuned in to those shows. I will post more information

01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:03.220
on the website all about it in the coming weeks. So it's our first like

01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:07.140
really really big giveaway so I'm excited. So big thanks to Float Walk and

01:07:07.140 --> 01:07:10.460
DDR spot for helping us out with that. So stay tuned to the website and of course

01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:14.500
if you're not eligible for the Orange Lounge Radio one because I believe the

01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:18.820
rule was if you've been to Orange Lounge Radio in person three times you're

01:07:18.820 --> 01:07:23.560
considered a regular and you're not eligible so but but a lot of you guys

01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:28.500
would be eligible to win DDR spots and vice versa DDR spot staff could be

01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:32.380
eligible for ours so something to think about all right so you got some

01:07:32.380 --> 01:07:35.980
competition out there that we all want the CDs I I would love to keep them I

01:07:35.980 --> 01:07:40.500
think we'll just close the station down tomorrow and I'll just keep them all

01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:44.180
right no we're gonna be doing that if it's any consolation even I'm not

01:07:44.180 --> 01:07:51.060
keeping an autographed CD. These are all sharing to the people. Of course, I have my own autographs

01:07:51.060 --> 01:07:53.620
of his, but that's neither here nor there.

01:07:53.620 --> 01:08:00.080
Alright. Also, I got a big announcement. A lot of people in the room don't even know

01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:04.940
this one yet, because we just got the okay on it, just a couple hours before you guys

01:08:04.940 --> 01:08:10.540
all got here. But next week, we're going to have an interview. Our very first Bamani artist

01:08:10.540 --> 01:08:12.440
is going to be on the show

01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:16.260
conception from the are also makes two he did the song altitude he's gonna be

01:08:16.260 --> 01:08:17.440
on the show next week

01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:20.420
so check out how to be here live we're gonna talk to him over our brand new

01:08:20.420 --> 01:08:23.340
uh... skype out thing we've got we can call him

01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:24.620
already talking to him

01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:26.480
and we might have another one

01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:29.440
in the next few weeks uh... we'll see i don't know i don't know if you want to

01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:32.660
say they are not that

01:08:32.660 --> 01:08:33.980
we might also have

01:08:33.980 --> 01:08:37.740
the guy behind the most kick-ass remit in baumanni

01:08:37.740 --> 01:08:42.740
Looked at the, um, not looked at this guy. In my eyes, the Midihead remix, Midihead.

01:08:42.740 --> 01:08:47.740
We might have Midiheads, so we're working on that. We're working it.

01:08:47.740 --> 01:08:50.740
This could be the beginning of something beautiful.

01:08:50.740 --> 01:08:53.740
We'll see. Now I'm looking forward to asking Conceptual a lot of questions.

01:08:53.740 --> 01:08:54.740
How do you feel like real radio?

01:08:54.740 --> 01:08:56.740
I know, it's so weird.

01:08:56.740 --> 01:09:01.740
Pretty soon, you know, we'll outgrow this little apartment studio thing we got going.

01:09:01.740 --> 01:09:03.740
That means we can have a compound.

01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:08.420
we might have to sell ads on the site because people might actually want to

01:09:08.420 --> 01:09:11.620
like get known out there anyway so that's definitely interesting we're

01:09:11.620 --> 01:09:16.340
going to ask conception a lot of questions about how he became hooked up

01:09:16.340 --> 01:09:20.700
with Ultramix 2 and what is music lag with songs about he's actually gonna

01:09:20.700 --> 01:09:23.660
send us a song too and I don't think a lot of guys have heard it yet so we're

01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:30.020
gonna play that for you guys next week on the show so stay tuned for that let's

01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:36.300
Let's see. What should we do now? Are we going to go to break? Let's do a break. You guys

01:09:36.300 --> 01:09:37.300
want a break?

01:09:37.300 --> 01:09:38.300
We can break things.

01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:40.820
Yeah, let's do a break. I think, how much longer are you guys going to be here?

01:09:40.820 --> 01:09:42.820
Another segment, I guess.

01:09:42.820 --> 01:09:49.860
Try another segment? Maybe another hour? Okay. Let's see if we can't do some good old-fashioned

01:09:49.860 --> 01:09:55.260
Bahmani match game tonight, okay? Here's how it's going to work, though. We're going to

01:09:55.260 --> 01:09:59.660
get a caller on Skype, and of course, what we do when we get somebody on Skype, they

01:09:59.660 --> 01:10:07.140
will get to challenge either Float Walk, Sharks Girl, Islander, or Iguana Girl, or Navi, or

01:10:07.140 --> 01:10:11.700
Arcadian 42, they can pick somebody to challenge on tonight's Bimani match game, so that should

01:10:11.700 --> 01:10:12.700
be a lot of fun.

01:10:12.700 --> 01:10:13.700
You guys up for it?

01:10:13.700 --> 01:10:14.700
Yeah!

01:10:14.700 --> 01:10:15.700
Alright.

01:10:15.700 --> 01:10:16.700
Absolutely.

01:10:16.700 --> 01:10:17.700
So we're going to do some Bimani match game tonight.

01:10:17.700 --> 01:10:22.900
Also, right now, we're going to get to some stuff from 2DX Red, and to be honest, I've

01:10:22.900 --> 01:10:29.020
kind of fallen behind on 2DX Red, so I'm going to turn to our local moderator on Bimani style

01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:32.520
probably knows about more of what's going on with 2DX Red than I do.

01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:36.020
Navi, what's up with 2DX Red? The game's out? Is that correct?

01:10:36.020 --> 01:10:41.020
It's out. It came out the day after the site went up.

01:10:41.020 --> 01:10:47.020
Well, the official, it was like the 27th or 28th of October. It went up.

01:10:47.020 --> 01:10:52.020
Yep. It's out. What else do you want? I've had a brain fart.

01:10:52.020 --> 01:10:56.020
I bring the microphone to you. I stalk you. Tell the class about it.

01:10:56.020 --> 01:11:00.020
English, do you speak it?

01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:04.020
English. It's red. It's very red.

01:11:04.020 --> 01:11:08.020
Things about it. God, it's another 2DX mix.

01:11:08.020 --> 01:11:12.020
I don't really know what all that is to be said. You just need to listen to that music.

01:11:12.020 --> 01:11:16.020
Give me the fucking mic.

01:11:16.020 --> 01:11:20.020
I'm annoyed at the site right now, though, because there's no artwork for me to download

01:11:20.020 --> 01:11:24.020
to make my desktop wallpaper.

01:11:24.020 --> 01:11:28.020
I'll have you give me inspiration, Loki, then I'll take something intelligent for once.

01:11:54.020 --> 01:12:02.020
but that's also being added. Then we've got the addition of, what is it, 8 Plus Star?

01:12:02.020 --> 01:12:08.020
They've broken down the ratings into 1 through 8 and Flashing Eights. Flashing Eights now

01:12:08.020 --> 01:12:15.020
are just songs like A and Kakumei and stuff like that. There's been plenty of songs that

01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:18.020
have been upgraded, some that I thought were kind of weird upgrade, like Zero One's now

01:12:18.020 --> 01:12:27.500
an 8 and Linus is an 8 and a bunch of other crap. Most of the, a lot of old

01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:31.700
artists, the regular artists, are not in it. They are off doing other

01:12:31.700 --> 01:12:36.540
projects right now so they have revived a lot of old artists like like fourth

01:12:36.540 --> 01:12:42.620
style kind of stuff like Nova Nude or no no no that was a fake. That was a fake.

01:12:42.620 --> 01:12:51.980
There was no Super Highway? No, there was no voter asylum either. They revived Wall

01:12:51.980 --> 01:13:00.580
Five. I love their new song. If you see the new video for it, it's really cool. It's like

01:13:00.580 --> 01:13:10.060
a bunch of twitching animals to the song. Baby Weapon, DJ Swan from Fifth Style. There's

01:13:10.060 --> 01:13:14.400
There's actually a handful of artists that, you know, like, when the 2DX, um, when the

01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:18.140
remix album for 10th Style came out were all, who the fuck are they? Well, now they have

01:13:18.140 --> 01:13:23.780
their own songs in here. Um, DJ 19, DJ Tomo, I think DJ Yoshitaka was one of the ones that

01:13:23.780 --> 01:13:25.300
was on the 10th Style remix album also.

01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:27.980
I'm glad to see Ryu doing something other than happy hardcore.

01:13:27.980 --> 01:13:30.820
Yeah, his new song isn't as great as they were in 10th Style.

01:13:30.820 --> 01:13:34.020
I like it. I forget what his song was, though, but it wasn't...

01:13:34.020 --> 01:13:35.020
It'd be quiet.

01:13:35.020 --> 01:13:37.700
Be quiet? I love that song! That's awesome!

01:13:37.700 --> 01:13:39.800
of that uh...

01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:43.900
god uh... ice can't understand what the fuck paul terry is saying

01:13:43.900 --> 01:13:45.580
and he sucks again

01:13:45.580 --> 01:13:47.040
she said

01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:51.220
you know i'm sorry she's only good with uh... mom i'm i'm

01:13:51.220 --> 01:13:53.140
what's-her-name

01:13:53.140 --> 01:13:54.040
you

01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:57.820
any issues out of key as usual well you know it's really weird because like

01:13:57.820 --> 01:14:00.180
anything

01:14:00.180 --> 01:14:02.180
that one mix that you

01:14:02.180 --> 01:14:03.700
found no key

01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:05.600
well no okay the only stuff i've heard of

01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:07.160
paul terry's good with that

01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:11.680
trans artist I found orbitribe that's that's it yeah yeah the only like I

01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:15.600
don't know what it is maybe like I know maybe Naoki has like some well you know

01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:19.520
now he sounds like real key like oh my god I think what do though fucking have

01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:25.160
you heard have you heard red zone have you heard it if you know no it's how I'm

01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:30.520
attached and Naoki and it sounds like some really old DDR song that's Naoki I

01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:35.280
mean he needs to just go under another alias and just stay under that alias and

01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:41.640
ever, ever, ever go back to Naoki again. Because, honestly, this, I mean, I, you know, I like

01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:47.560
Yuru, no, I don't like Yuru Bean, I'm not gonna try to lie there. You know, stuff like

01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:50.880
Be For You, Brilliant To You and stuff, that was good back then.

01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:55.760
That's what Red Zone sounds like. Stop making the same damn song over and over

01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:58.840
and telling it something different. I think it's really funny that Red Zone sounds

01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:03.840
like that, but he's in collaboration with a new sound producer. Um, Slake is no longer

01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:11.400
sound producer on this apparently he's got three songs in the mix already but

01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:15.960
yeah I was like all the artists that are no longer with the mix this current mix

01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:25.240
right now we will not be seeing mr. T tak show you to Rohrata huh god I'm

01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:29.520
forgetting there's there was a ton of them that just that aren't in there at

01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:35.080
least aren't in there yet. Now, was any of the artists that, what was it, from like,

01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:41.880
I think it was, god, I think it was from like 9th Style, the ones that, was it the, I still

01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:45.280
haven't seen any, the musicianship trials, are they back, you mean? I haven't seen any

01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:52.120
of them, but they have new, there were people who won stuff from the new Bamani Vocal Audition

01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:56.880
earlier this year. There's this new chick in there, I forget her name, but she has two

01:15:56.880 --> 01:16:04.400
songs with Naoki. One of them is Taio, and the other one is D-A-N-C-E.

01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:10.240
Man, what the hell is up with a guy being in B4U? That's what I want to know.

01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:15.320
I mean, you gotta either feel sorry for him, or he's the luckiest bastard in the world.

01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:19.600
What are you talking about? There is a guy in the group B4U.

01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:23.640
There is not a guy in B4U. There is a guy. I swear to God it's a guy.

01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:25.640
You want me to point it out?

01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:27.640
Show me the guy!

01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:29.640
Show me the guy!

01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:31.640
I want to see this!

01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:37.640
There were five people that won the Bimani Vocal Audition.

01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:39.640
Three of them are now members of B4U.

01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:44.640
One of them was the chick that has the two songs from 2DX right now and another one is a guy.

01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:48.640
He has not had any songs that I know of yet.

01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:50.640
Where are you going?

01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:52.640
Yeah, okay.

01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:54.640
Doo doo doo doo doo.

01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:56.640
Wait, wait, wait.

01:16:56.640 --> 01:16:58.640
Wait, wait, wait.

01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:00.640
Doo doo doo doo.

01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:02.640
Okay.

and the new Orange Lounge song.

01:17:52.180 --> 01:17:54.520

Have a good one.

01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:12.420
To be continued

01:21:42.420 --> 01:21:44.920
I can't let you out, I can't let you see

01:23:44.920 --> 01:24:08.360
For the best part of Orange Lab, this PDF sucks!

01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:11.360
Stop!

01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:20.360
Hello, and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio. You know, we have several of those...

01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:21.360
Yay, Step Squad!

01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:22.360
We have several of those little...

01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:23.360
I love everyone!

01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:24.360
Step Squad!

01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:30.660
We have several little DDL factions in house. We have representation from RTF, we have representation

01:24:30.660 --> 01:24:35.360
from Step Squad, and we have representation from the Nobodies. Thank you.

01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:44.080
Alright, shark skull, big fat nobodies, BFN for life, they're real!

01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:49.260
I'm representing Heaven's Gate, I just forgot to drink the Kool-Aid.

01:24:49.260 --> 01:24:51.800
I think a new DDR squad has just been born.

01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:55.920
BFN, big fat nothing, is this our gang sign, what is this, why do we keep doing this, I

01:24:55.920 --> 01:24:56.920
don't know.

01:24:56.920 --> 01:24:57.920
ETERGEO!

01:24:57.920 --> 01:25:10.920
Hey, Navi, want to be in BFN? Yeah! Yeah! Alright. Actually, BFN should be that. A big fat nothing.

01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:22.920
Okay. We'll be taking applications a little later. Alright. That's BFL. That's a little different.

01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:27.720
Of course, a few people said I was in the GFR squad, but I...

01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:34.920
Anyway, so, speaking of GFR, did you get this guy in B4U situation sorted out?

01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:41.920
Yes, yes, yes, it's not B4U, but he's just some ugly guy that's in a picture with B4U

01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:42.920
people, so.

01:25:42.920 --> 01:25:50.440
Anyways, there's this guy named Reija Sakurai, and looks like, I don't know, he's going to

01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:54.120
be singing something for some baumanni game. Poor bastard.

01:25:54.120 --> 01:26:01.320
He could very well be in the... And he'll be giving head at Bellfire.

01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:05.120
I know. I wouldn't be surprised if he's in one of the CS songs for popin' music.

01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:13.160
I don't know. I'd like to segue for about 30 seconds here

Thank you. What's going on with Under Station Live?

01:29:04.980 --> 01:29:08.140
Not a damn thing. Well, that's why I wanted to give you a chance

01:29:08.140 --> 01:29:14.220
to plug it, so folks can go listen to it. Why?

01:29:14.220 --> 01:29:19.920
We don't even listen to it. We don't even do the show.

01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:25.100
You don't do the show anymore? Well, if that's what you call wasting a Saturday...

01:29:25.100 --> 01:29:28.420
I thought that's what you... That's what we always used to do!

01:29:28.420 --> 01:29:31.660
I know, what's changed since Jessica and I were on there?

01:29:31.660 --> 01:29:41.060
a baby. Aw. Kira. How is the baby doing? She's a little shit. I bet she makes a lot of little

01:29:41.060 --> 01:29:49.900
shits too. No, she makes big shits. Have fun. Big, stinky, chunky shits. Are you going to

01:29:49.900 --> 01:29:58.060
get her to play DDR? Oh, in your wildest dreams, meat boy. I had to ask. I still love that,

01:29:58.060 --> 01:30:02.700
I still love that Too Unlimited video you did.

01:30:02.700 --> 01:30:07.100
I actually just watched it just the other day, again.

01:30:07.100 --> 01:30:11.780
I had been working on others, but my job, fortunately, takes so much time away from

01:30:11.780 --> 01:30:15.340
me, I don't even have time to sit down and update my life journal.

01:30:15.340 --> 01:30:18.180
Yeah, we noticed.

01:30:18.180 --> 01:30:21.180
Thank you.

01:30:21.180 --> 01:30:25.200
How are things on the left coast?

01:30:25.200 --> 01:30:26.200
Left as always.

01:30:26.200 --> 01:30:27.200
It's good.

01:30:27.200 --> 01:30:41.000
I don't know, sunny, I don't know, rainy, angry, sad, sad, mad, well actually, let me

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:46.800
ask Rob this, how do you feel about yourself, you Rob, running for public office?

01:30:46.800 --> 01:30:51.720
I've contemplated it, I seriously have, but I just don't think, because kids don't vote,

01:30:51.720 --> 01:30:54.520
the youth doesn't vote, I think if I were to run, I would have to get the youth vote

01:30:54.520 --> 01:30:57.720
connection and in this area which has a bunch of retired citizens that ain't

01:30:57.720 --> 01:31:00.200
gonna happen I've given it serious thought in the

01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:05.200
past though well have I got news for you what's that all right is everybody

01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:12.400
sitting down okay everybody got their towel okay don't forget you're down I

01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:18.300
have an announcement mmm what's this as I talk really close to the mic okay well

01:31:18.300 --> 01:31:19.820
We can hear you just fine.

01:31:19.820 --> 01:31:21.740
Okay, so, Rich, shut up.

01:31:21.740 --> 01:31:23.420
Shh.

01:31:23.420 --> 01:31:26.980
Shh.

01:31:26.980 --> 01:31:31.220
Seeing what has happened in the last two weeks with the election,

01:31:31.220 --> 01:31:34.820
a country divided, one side against another,

01:31:34.820 --> 01:31:40.820
people burning down houses, cars, accosting people,

01:31:40.820 --> 01:31:42.140
half the country likes one person,

01:31:42.140 --> 01:31:44.020
half the country likes the other person,

01:31:44.020 --> 01:31:46.920
I've decided to take a stand.

01:31:46.920 --> 01:31:54.920
I, Travis Donovan, officially announce my candidacy for President of the United States in 2008.

01:31:56.920 --> 01:31:58.920
Travis, wait, wait, wait, wait, Travis.

01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:02.920
Hang on, make me stop the music.

01:32:04.920 --> 01:32:07.920
You're not going to be 35 by then.

01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:11.920
You have to be 35 at the time of the inauguration.

01:32:11.920 --> 01:32:13.720
Mm-mm.

01:32:13.720 --> 01:32:20.800
Birth certificates can be altered by a month.

01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:25.300
I have decided I am running for president, and if that doesn't work, I'm running for

01:32:25.300 --> 01:32:27.560
governor of Texas in 06.

01:32:27.560 --> 01:32:38.080
Thank you, thank you, hang on, hang on, I got my crowd here too.

01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:39.080
There we go.

01:32:39.080 --> 01:32:41.840
Well, you do realize what this means.

01:32:41.840 --> 01:32:44.540
Now I have to run.

01:32:44.540 --> 01:32:47.540
Far, far away.

01:32:47.540 --> 01:32:49.040
Damn it.

01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:53.040
I just put that whole rant in my live journal about how I wasn't going to move to Canada,

01:32:53.040 --> 01:32:54.740
but now I'm reconsidering.

01:32:54.740 --> 01:32:58.340
Well, I have two propositions for you on that.

01:32:58.340 --> 01:33:01.840
Are you going to legalize gay marriage?

01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:03.640
Let's not go there yet.

01:33:03.640 --> 01:33:08.540
Because after all, after all, I'm the working man for the working people.

01:33:08.540 --> 01:33:09.240
All right.

01:33:09.240 --> 01:33:10.340
I work.

01:33:10.340 --> 01:33:12.540
thank you

01:33:12.540 --> 01:33:15.120
now here's my proposition for iraq

01:33:15.120 --> 01:33:16.940
i'm running for president alright

01:33:16.940 --> 01:33:17.920
i'm gonna need

01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:21.180
a vice presidential candidate

01:33:21.180 --> 01:33:24.900
you're it rob

01:33:24.900 --> 01:33:28.420
i'm sorry there but wait a minute you're a public and i'm a democrat could that

01:33:28.420 --> 01:33:31.580
ever possibly work

01:33:31.580 --> 01:33:32.680
yeah i'm your point

01:33:32.680 --> 01:33:34.700
we'll find out all right

01:33:34.700 --> 01:33:38.700
this is a perfect opportunity like i've been ranting about in my life to throw

01:33:38.700 --> 01:33:44.140
away the stupid bipartisan bullshit. That's right. Travis and I can come together.

01:33:44.140 --> 01:33:48.060
Advance in the party mindset. But, but, but, but, but.

01:33:48.060 --> 01:33:53.260
We can come on each other, we can come together. Now, you're making a Guana girl sad because

01:33:53.260 --> 01:33:56.780
she doesn't know what she's going to do. She doesn't get to be Vice President. What can

01:33:56.780 --> 01:34:01.820
she do? Let's fire Condoleezza Rice and put Jess in

01:34:01.820 --> 01:34:02.820
there. No.

01:34:02.820 --> 01:34:03.820
No? No.

01:34:03.820 --> 01:34:07.260
What does she get to do? Because I, I don't want to do.

01:34:07.260 --> 01:34:09.300
I get to stand around and have big boobs?

01:34:09.300 --> 01:34:11.020
No, I...

01:34:11.020 --> 01:34:15.140
Secretary of Big Boobs, there's an idea.

01:34:15.140 --> 01:34:20.140
No, I actually gave that some thought. Jess can be Secretary of, uh, Agriculture.

01:34:20.140 --> 01:34:25.420
So long as I get to play with the cows!

01:34:25.420 --> 01:34:29.900
You have to be the Secretary of Agriculture, eh heh!

01:34:29.900 --> 01:34:31.460
Because I figure if you want a

01:34:31.460 --> 01:34:37.220
woman who PMS's as far down on the chain of succession as possible...

01:34:37.220 --> 01:34:47.380
I haven't calmed down at all I'm just zoning you Travis now great you just

01:34:47.380 --> 01:34:54.340
lost us a boat way to go way to go Travis I didn't say everybody was gonna

01:34:54.340 --> 01:35:00.060
like us I'm honest and upfront about it I'm gonna be plain spoken for the plain

01:35:00.060 --> 01:35:05.820
spoken people I will have no problem telling candidates to shut the fuck up I

01:35:05.820 --> 01:35:14.820
I will have no problems pointing out that my running mate is gay.

01:35:14.820 --> 01:35:18.820
I don't need the other candidates to tell me this. I've known this.

01:35:18.820 --> 01:35:20.820
I'm here!

01:35:20.820 --> 01:35:25.820
Just like, what was the point of John Kerry pointing out to Dick Cheney that his daughter was gay?

01:35:25.820 --> 01:35:30.820
No shit, I think he knows.

01:35:30.820 --> 01:35:32.820
Actually, that was some words that did that, but yeah.

01:35:32.820 --> 01:35:36.820
Were you expecting him to have a revelation and a heart attack right then and there, going,

01:35:36.820 --> 01:35:39.820
JESUS, HE'S GAY!

01:35:39.820 --> 01:35:42.820
I don't think so.

01:35:42.820 --> 01:35:43.820
But...

01:35:43.820 --> 01:35:49.820
I'm seriously considering this. It's a grassroots campaign. It's a third-party kind of thing.

01:35:49.820 --> 01:35:52.820
Well, we have to come up with a name for the third party.

01:35:52.820 --> 01:35:53.820
The People's Party!

01:35:53.820 --> 01:35:55.820
The People's Party!

01:35:55.820 --> 01:35:56.820
I like that.

01:35:56.820 --> 01:35:57.820
And if anybody can access the social...

01:35:57.820 --> 01:35:58.820
The Social Party!

01:35:58.820 --> 01:35:59.820
The House.

01:35:59.820 --> 01:36:03.380
It could be the house party.

01:36:03.380 --> 01:36:07.260
Travis and Rob's house party, all at once!

01:36:07.260 --> 01:36:08.260
I like it.

01:36:08.260 --> 01:36:09.260
Totally live!

01:36:09.260 --> 01:36:14.220
Well, we're going to have to get my people in touch with your people, and people things.

01:36:14.220 --> 01:36:17.340
I don't see that happening.

01:36:17.340 --> 01:36:21.420
You think I'm all crazy because I live out here in Texas because, oh, I'm sorry, as people

01:36:21.420 --> 01:36:25.100
have pointed out in this last week, I'm a redneck because I live in Texas.

01:36:25.100 --> 01:36:26.740
Well, no.

01:36:26.740 --> 01:36:29.340
I don't think you're a redneck, maybe a...

01:36:29.340 --> 01:36:35.980
And as people pointed out, now it's time for the South to secede.

01:36:35.980 --> 01:36:41.500
Yes, the rest of us are going to form the United States of Canada, hahaha, you're right.

01:36:41.500 --> 01:36:44.140
Well, this is my second condition.

01:36:44.140 --> 01:36:48.340
If you're serious about going to Canada, along with all these other people who want to leave

01:36:48.340 --> 01:36:49.340
the country...

01:36:49.340 --> 01:36:50.340
Of which I am not.

01:36:50.340 --> 01:36:51.380
I would never leave to Canada.

01:36:51.380 --> 01:36:56.500
If you were to sign a legal binding document that you will get your ass out and never come

01:36:56.500 --> 01:37:00.500
I will personally start donating to the U-Haul truck to get you the fuck out.

01:37:00.500 --> 01:37:05.500
And I will use big bills.

01:37:05.500 --> 01:37:12.500
As I've said before, just because the guy I did not vote for and did not want to win won,

01:37:12.500 --> 01:37:15.500
that does not mean I hide my tail behind my legs and go to Canada.

01:37:15.500 --> 01:37:18.500
That just means I have to yell a little louder.

01:37:18.500 --> 01:37:20.500
No, you just sit there and bitch and whine.

01:37:20.500 --> 01:37:23.500
Exactly! That's what we do! It's the American way!

01:37:23.500 --> 01:37:27.500
Damn straight! America, fuck yeah!

01:37:27.500 --> 01:37:29.500
Exactly. Exactly.

01:37:29.500 --> 01:37:32.500
No, but my question was, did you...

01:37:32.500 --> 01:37:33.500
Sorry.

01:37:33.500 --> 01:37:40.500
Did you expect, Rob, on the next day, Wednesday, to see a big gloating thing in my LiveJournal?

01:37:40.500 --> 01:37:42.500
Actually, no.

01:37:42.500 --> 01:37:43.500
Why?

01:37:43.500 --> 01:37:46.500
Because I think everybody knows that kind of stuff's in poor taste.

01:37:46.500 --> 01:37:50.500
Obviously not a lot of people in LiveJournal did.

01:37:50.500 --> 01:37:54.060
i didn't really feel a lot of gloating i mean if anybody i'm not going to be

01:37:54.060 --> 01:37:54.740
holding

01:37:54.740 --> 01:37:57.900
most of the people i knew if they go out and i could have said well california

01:37:57.900 --> 01:38:00.980
went blue so you know but you know

01:38:00.980 --> 01:38:02.840
but i mean it doesn't matter i mean

01:38:02.840 --> 01:38:05.920
it happened so only half a california went blue

01:38:05.920 --> 01:38:08.400
uh... fifty five percent went blue get it right

01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:12.140
that's half of california only forty four percent

01:38:12.140 --> 01:38:16.340
anyway yeah discount the uh... over four million popular vote

01:38:16.340 --> 01:38:17.100
anyway

01:38:17.100 --> 01:38:18.140
but anyway what

01:38:18.140 --> 01:38:19.800
now we are just get along

01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:21.500
tell y'all to get along

01:38:21.500 --> 01:38:26.700
no other get about but i have a look at let's just have a bipartisan orgy and be

01:38:26.700 --> 01:38:28.580
done with it you know no

01:38:28.580 --> 01:38:29.920
get rid of it

01:38:29.920 --> 01:38:31.100
get rid of

01:38:31.100 --> 01:38:34.960
the electoral college in parties on those stupid

01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:38.940
no military college is not stupid i've had this debate with with you guys back

01:38:38.940 --> 01:38:41.680
in two thousand and i'm gonna have it over and over again

01:38:41.680 --> 01:38:45.460
it gives the small counties with the sluts population right back when i had

01:38:45.460 --> 01:38:47.720
a debate on this show we have stupid

01:38:47.720 --> 01:38:54.600
12 year old games to be talking about, okay? Speaking of stupid 12 year old games, are

01:38:54.600 --> 01:39:02.600
you going to be on Halo 2? Of course. I get to, I get to frag a fag, I get to frag a fag.

01:39:02.600 --> 01:39:06.760
Yeah, most people in Texas would be, you know, happy about that. Anyway, no I'm kidding.

01:39:06.760 --> 01:39:15.400
Oh come on, it's been four years since we lynched a queer. I accept, I accept your challenge

01:39:15.400 --> 01:39:24.280
Mr. Donovan. Well, you better, Mr. Roberts. And then when I kill you, I'm going to say,

01:39:24.280 --> 01:39:30.280
ha ha, you got your ass kicked by a fag. Just like I do to the little hecklers that try

01:39:30.280 --> 01:39:34.700
to challenge me on ER. And then at that point, I run over you in the warthog. And then we

01:39:34.700 --> 01:39:38.480
put Jenna's ten-year-old nephew on, and he kicks both our asses, which he does on a regular

01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:42.920
basis. Alright. Which is scary. Alright, we gotta cut it short, because we gotta get to

01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:52.120
the bit that we stole from usl okay what bit uh the match game you copyright stealing motherfucking

01:39:52.120 --> 01:39:58.120
i wouldn't have been copywritten before yeah you stole it copywritten and trademarked

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:07.800
but i stole it like 100th time down the line it's homage imitation is the finest form of flattery

01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:15.200
Love you Travis. Yeah, whatever. Bye. Bye. Bye Travis. That was nice to have him on the

01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:19.480
show. Yay, Travis. That's exciting. I've never been asked to be a vice presidential candidate

01:40:19.480 --> 01:40:25.320
before. I've been asked to be somebody's maid of honor, but never the vice presidential

01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:29.320
candidate. That's going to be amazing. I'm excited. Alright, we are going to open it

01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:34.520
up for Match Game in just a minute. However, we had one other person that wanted to talk

01:40:34.520 --> 01:40:38.280
to us in the studio. Yes, we're going to make another call, believe it or not. So let's

01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:41.520
go ahead and make that call right now.

01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:46.600
Oh, there we go. Yay.

01:40:46.600 --> 01:40:48.440
One ringy tingy.

01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:49.640
Hello?

01:40:49.640 --> 01:40:53.520
Hi, is this Shane?

01:40:53.520 --> 01:40:54.360
Yeah.

01:40:54.360 --> 01:40:57.920
We can barely hear you. Can you talk louder or something?

01:40:57.920 --> 01:40:59.280
Is this loud?

01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:03.440
Somewhat. We can like barely, barely hear you. What's up?

01:41:03.440 --> 01:41:06.440
That sucks. Nothing. Can't yell.

01:41:06.440 --> 01:41:11.440
Oh, okay. Well, what's up? You wanted to say hello to some folks here, or what's up?

01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:13.440
Yeah, hi everybody.

01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:16.440
Hi.

01:41:16.440 --> 01:41:18.440
How's it going for you?

01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:19.440
I'm sick.

01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:22.440
You're sick? Oh, another sick person. Great.

01:41:22.440 --> 01:41:23.440
Yeah.

01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:24.440
What are you sick with?

01:41:24.440 --> 01:41:26.440
Well, I'm puking. I'm not sure.

01:41:26.440 --> 01:41:31.440
Oh. Well, unfortunately the volume is so low that it's hard for us to hear you right now,

01:41:31.440 --> 01:41:34.960
Anything you wanted to say since we called you?

01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:43.800
I want to say that everybody needs to buy Karaoke Revolution for Xbox this week so Halo

01:41:43.800 --> 01:41:49.000
2 doesn't take out all the sales, because I don't want to keep filling Halo 2 this week.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:58.360
And watch Drawn Together on Comedy Central because it's funny, and that's it.

01:41:58.360 --> 01:42:01.360
Is there any UltraMix 2 songs you're looking forward to?

01:42:02.360 --> 01:42:04.360
Yeah, but I can't say them.

01:42:04.360 --> 01:42:07.360
Oh, I thought he was going to say Baille La Samba.

01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:09.360
Oh, well I already said that last time.

01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:10.360
Alright.

01:42:10.360 --> 01:42:11.360
Okay, Baille La Samba.

01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:14.360
We'll play Baille La Samba just for you a little later.

01:42:14.360 --> 01:42:15.360
Okay, cool.

01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:19.360
Alright, well I'm sorry, we're going to have to let you go because it's too quiet, but you have a good one, okay?

01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:20.360
Okay, you too.

01:42:20.360 --> 01:42:21.360
Everyone say bye, Shane!

01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:22.360
Bye!

01:42:22.360 --> 01:42:24.360
Come back to California, you bum!

01:42:26.360 --> 01:42:27.360
Alright, I hope you heard that.

01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:32.560
that. They said, come back to California, you bum, and play Final Fantasy. I think you

01:42:32.560 --> 01:42:36.200
already hung up. Oh well. Hopefully he hears that when it comes through a little later.

01:42:36.200 --> 01:42:44.000
All right. Let's see. What we're going to do now, should we get into match game? You

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.760
guys want to take a quick break? All right, let's go get into match game. I got to find

01:42:46.760 --> 01:42:51.240
the match game music though. How about a one song break? We want to do like just a quick

01:42:51.240 --> 01:42:55.120
little break while we set up. That would be good. A quick one song break. You know, everybody's

01:42:55.120 --> 01:42:59.680
been wanting to hear music last time you did you find that match game music for

01:42:59.680 --> 01:43:05.700
us and in this break I know there was another ultra mix to be rare song the

01:43:05.700 --> 01:43:10.140
folks wanted to hear so let's see if we can find that for the folks out there

01:43:10.140 --> 01:43:14.560
what was the song that I wanted to play for people it's called set people on

01:43:14.560 --> 01:43:21.120
fire I don't remember what was it oh it's by

01:43:21.120 --> 01:43:24.360
la samba since we just talked to Shane of course we're gonna play this one we'll

01:44:40.360 --> 01:44:45.360
And I'll come your way, finally, finally

01:44:45.360 --> 01:45:11.280
We are back here on Orange Launch Radio, we're going to get into the Mani Match Game, pretty

01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:16.960
soon here we're just trying to get the files copied over that we need all right

01:45:16.960 --> 01:45:20.320
so the way this works we're gonna open up the skype line in just a minute and

01:45:20.320 --> 01:45:23.640
just as a reminder there's a little bit of a buffer so you're gonna want to

01:45:23.640 --> 01:45:27.240
watch for the little icon to turn to green because that's really the moment

01:45:27.240 --> 01:45:30.480
when we're starting to take calls so the first person through will get to play

01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:35.000
match game tonight and you get to challenge somebody in the room but not

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.480
one of the hosts you have to challenge a guest because that's the rule that I

01:45:37.480 --> 01:45:41.600
I just made up. That was very is it of you.

01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:48.680
Thank you. Cake or death. So you get to challenge one of the guests and all the other guests

01:45:48.680 --> 01:45:52.920
will be answering questions. So the way match game works, we have a little statement that

01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:57.160
we read and the statement has a blank in it. And then you have to fill in the blank. You

01:45:57.160 --> 01:46:00.720
want to try and match as many other people in the room on the blank as you can. We're

01:46:00.720 --> 01:46:03.360
going to make it a quick game tonight because Sharks Girl and Float Walk unfortunately have

01:46:03.360 --> 01:46:06.200
to get out of here pretty soon. So we have to kind of make it a quick game. It's going

01:46:06.200 --> 01:46:10.640
be a three question game tonight. It's like Mad Libs Only Not. Yes, it's like Mad Libs

01:46:10.640 --> 01:46:16.480
Only Not. Very good. So, let's find ourselves some match game music here. It's not the same

01:46:16.480 --> 01:46:29.480
match game theme, but it's good. Price is Right Car Music. A new car! You've won a Geo

01:46:29.480 --> 01:46:36.160

01:57:16.620 --> 01:57:18.620
Iguana Girl.

01:57:18.620 --> 01:57:21.860
I-ironically, mine's actually along the same vein.

01:57:21.860 --> 01:57:24.860
Okay. Huge piles of feces!

01:57:24.860 --> 01:57:27.900
Huge piles of feces!

01:57:27.900 --> 01:57:30.820
Not a match.

01:57:30.820 --> 01:57:35.020
Alright, uh, Arcadian, we're looking for, I forgot the answers now already, what do you think you want?

01:57:35.020 --> 01:57:36.980
A big package

01:57:36.980 --> 01:57:38.900
with a karaoke machine

01:57:38.900 --> 01:57:45.780
of Politary's greatest hits. Oh, a karaoke machine of Politary's greatest hits.

01:57:45.780 --> 01:57:47.000
Chirp, chirp.

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:55.520
Loki. No, it's sad that no one got Jamie's because mine was the king of the cosmos, Severed

01:57:55.520 --> 01:58:03.200
Cock. That would be a big package. Mine's somewhat similar. I said that she burninated

01:58:03.200 --> 01:58:10.620
everything when she saw that the present was a dildo modeled after Naoki.

01:58:10.620 --> 01:58:16.820
How would I find it? Let's move on. All right. Very nice. All right.

01:58:16.820 --> 01:58:21.900
all tied up 0-0. John, you gonna break this tie? We'll see. Navi, you gonna break this

01:58:21.900 --> 01:58:31.020
tie? Maybe. Alright, we'll see. Here we go. Question number three. We here at Orange Lounge

01:58:31.020 --> 01:58:37.820
Radio have become very concerned about Loki. When haven't we? But here we go. We've been

01:58:37.820 --> 01:58:43.340
very concerned about Loki. He's been playing a lot of Grand Theft Auto this week. And he

01:58:43.340 --> 01:58:47.940
started to blur the line between San Andreas in real life.

01:58:47.940 --> 01:58:54.940
The other co-hosts got very concerned of this when Loki went around and blank.

01:58:56.540 --> 01:58:59.040
The other co-hosts got very concerned that

01:58:59.040 --> 01:59:21.360
Loki was taking Grand Theft Auto a little too seriously when Loki went around and blanked.

01:59:21.360 --> 01:59:26.600
celebrities are currently thinking. Please wait.

01:59:34.480 --> 01:59:40.640
All right. Well, let's see. Are we gonna get a winner? We'll find out. Anybody still

01:59:40.640 --> 01:59:49.640
working? All right. Here we go. All right. It all comes down to this. We here at

01:59:49.640 --> 01:59:52.940
Orange Lounge Radio. I've become very concerned about Loki. He's been playing a lot of Grand

01:59:52.940 --> 01:59:56.420
Theft Auto this week, and he's starting to blur the line between San Andreas and Real

01:59:56.420 --> 02:00:00.420
Life. The other co-host got very concerned at this when Loki went around and... Navi?

02:00:00.420 --> 02:00:06.980
Bustin' a cap on yo ass! Bustin' a cap on yo ass! Let's see. John, the other co-host

02:00:06.980 --> 02:00:12.060
got very concerned at this when Loki went around and... Hurt other people. Hurt other

02:00:12.060 --> 02:00:18.460
people. Alright. Not very specific, but we'll see. Sometimes our guests can't be very specific.

02:00:18.460 --> 02:00:21.740
find out. DarkSakura, you became concerned of this when-

02:00:21.740 --> 02:00:25.740
He was saying it before I was still writing. Oh, I'm sorry.

02:00:25.740 --> 02:00:30.740
In the outfit of some stereotypical thug and tried to jack a plane, crash into the ocean,

02:00:30.740 --> 02:00:33.980
steal a semi and listen to the light at them while shooting at people.

02:00:33.980 --> 02:00:37.780
Very descriptive. I like that, but not a match. Shooting at people.

02:00:37.780 --> 02:00:42.780
All right. Well, but it's a little too much. But it doesn't necessarily mean I hit them,

02:00:42.780 --> 02:00:45.140
therefore not hurting them. All right.

02:00:45.140 --> 02:00:46.980
Uh, Flow-Walk.

02:00:46.980 --> 02:00:51.100
Uh, chase them with the purple dildo. Chase them with the purple dildo!

02:00:51.100 --> 02:00:52.140
Not a match.

02:00:52.140 --> 02:00:53.220
Starscroll.

02:00:53.220 --> 02:00:59.420
Jumped out of a plane screaming, it's a mile drop, I'll live!

02:00:59.420 --> 02:01:01.140
This is true, this is true.

02:01:01.140 --> 02:01:02.100
Islander.

02:01:02.100 --> 02:01:04.860
When he said, bitch, I'm gonna kill you!

02:01:04.860 --> 02:01:08.420
Bitch, I'm gonna kill you! Very close to capping your ass, but not quite.

02:01:08.420 --> 02:01:11.100
Iguana Girl. That was boring. Hijacked a helicopter.

02:01:11.100 --> 02:01:13.180
Hijacked a helicopter.

02:01:13.180 --> 02:01:17.180
You know, that would have been exciting if Loki really did that, but I don't think I would have been concerned.

02:01:17.180 --> 02:01:20.180
I would have been, you know how to fly a helicopter? We'll see.

02:01:20.180 --> 02:01:21.180
Alright, Arkadian.

02:01:21.180 --> 02:01:22.180
Ran over pedestrians.

02:01:22.180 --> 02:01:24.180
Ran over pedestrians.

02:01:24.180 --> 02:01:25.180
He does that anyway.

02:01:25.180 --> 02:01:26.180
Not a match, he does that anyway.

02:01:26.180 --> 02:01:27.180
Uh, Loki.

02:01:27.180 --> 02:01:29.180
I would have figured that would have been a match, actually.

02:01:29.180 --> 02:01:31.180
Alright, let's see here.

02:01:31.180 --> 02:01:35.180
Shooting the po-po and pipping crack hoes to make some fat scratch.

02:01:35.180 --> 02:01:38.180
Wow.

02:01:38.180 --> 02:01:39.180
Lovely.

02:01:39.180 --> 02:01:40.180
Lovely.

02:01:40.180 --> 02:01:45.140
Uh, and my answer was, uh, the other co-hosts got very concerned in this one, Loki went

02:01:45.140 --> 02:01:48.060
around and, uh, killed Dark Sacro with his Pip-Cane.

02:01:48.060 --> 02:01:56.260
I got a ferret thrown at me for that one.

02:01:56.260 --> 02:02:00.300
Alright, well, let's review the scores, boys and girls.

02:02:00.300 --> 02:02:05.980
Let's look at how our contestants did tonight.

02:02:05.980 --> 02:02:08.560
Let's look at the final scores.

02:02:10.560 --> 02:02:14.720
And then in second place is Nabby with zero points.

02:02:17.160 --> 02:02:22.040
And a tie for second place is John Fields with zero points.

02:02:22.040 --> 02:02:24.680
Congratulations John and Nabby,

02:02:24.680 --> 02:02:27.500
you are our big losers tonight.

02:02:27.500 --> 02:02:30.980
So Nabby, you get a frown, a collective frown

02:02:30.980 --> 02:02:33.840
from those of us in studio, ready?

02:02:33.840 --> 02:02:38.120
Alright, and John, do you know what you get for your score tonight?

02:02:38.120 --> 02:02:39.520
A frown from the chat room.

02:02:39.520 --> 02:02:41.520
No, you get hung up on.

02:02:41.520 --> 02:02:48.080
Aww, what a good sport, alright, he tried, they always fall for it, I hang up on them

02:02:48.080 --> 02:02:50.080
every time, they always fall for it.

02:02:50.080 --> 02:02:54.680
Alright, alright, no, thanks seriously for playing John Fields, it was a good time.

02:02:54.680 --> 02:02:58.400
Too bad about the, you know, no answers or anything, but no, it happens.

02:02:58.400 --> 02:03:02.680
Anyway, I guess, um, Sarkskull and Floatwalk are going to have to be leaving us soon because

02:03:02.680 --> 02:03:07.880
I got a long drive home. But, you know, I quickly wanted to ask Floor Walk and Sharks

02:03:07.880 --> 02:03:17.360
Girl just some, you know, general questions. Floor Walk, anything, I guess I should ask

02:03:17.360 --> 02:03:21.480
you about the Ultramix 2. I know there's a lot of things you can and can't say. You did

02:03:21.480 --> 02:03:25.160
mention that you're working somewhere else now, but you still have to follow the NDA

02:03:25.160 --> 02:03:27.000
or they come after you with their PIP canes, right?

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:30.640
Eh, for what it's worth. For what it's worth. But I want to ask you,

02:03:30.640 --> 02:03:32.640
Can you tell us anything about the release date?

02:03:32.640 --> 02:03:34.640
Because that's kind of a big question mark right now, do we know?

02:03:34.640 --> 02:03:40.640
Last I checked, it's roughly going to be around like November 18th I think it was, because actually it was

02:03:40.640 --> 02:03:46.640
I was hanging out with Jason Enos last night, so he gave us kind of a scoop on why there were delays and all that kind of stuff

02:03:46.640 --> 02:03:54.640
And it's actually pretty funny, but only people who were in the test group would appreciate such bumblings I guess

02:03:54.640 --> 02:03:55.640
For like a better term

02:03:55.640 --> 02:03:57.640
You know what, I was starting to get a little nervous there

02:03:57.640 --> 02:03:59.640
That we were going to have to wait for Christmas to see UltraMix 2

02:03:59.640 --> 02:04:02.440
But it's good to know that it looks like it's still on target, anyway.

02:04:02.440 --> 02:04:04.920
Yeah, it's looking to be pretty good.

02:04:04.920 --> 02:04:08.440
I mean, right now, things are pretty happy in the DDR camp.

02:04:08.440 --> 02:04:13.960
Xtreme sales have actually, well, what Jason did was he was comparing Max2 sales along

02:04:13.960 --> 02:04:17.840
with Xtreme, how they've been doing week by week, and Xtreme's been doing a good, like,

02:04:17.840 --> 02:04:21.640
up to around 33% better than what Max2 has been doing.

02:04:21.640 --> 02:04:22.640
Very nice!

02:04:22.640 --> 02:04:25.160
So they're looking, even projecting around holiday season, they're probably going to

02:04:25.160 --> 02:04:29.000
be jumping Max2 figures by about 40%.

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:35.000
So, you know, things are going well for that. Max 2 has almost hit 500,000 units.

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:36.000
Very nice.

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:39.000
So, you know, I mean, who knows? It could be a greatest hit someday, but...

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:46.000
Interesting. Interesting. So, what do you think? Now, I know you're not there anymore, so you can't really say one way or the other because you don't know,

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:49.000
but what do you think the chances are we're going to see some kind of Xtreme 2 next year?

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:58.000
Well, it's pretty safe to say. I mean, if it's a profitable franchise, you just keep milking it for what it's worth.

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:02.200
It's, I mean, good thing about DDR is even though the gameplay is pretty, you know, basic,

02:05:02.200 --> 02:05:06.720
it's always progressive with its music, so the music will always drive sales and, you

02:05:06.720 --> 02:05:09.000
know, people to try new titles.

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:14.280
Oh, yeah, okay. Hopefully if there is an Xtreme 2, they'll have the sense of humor to make

02:05:14.280 --> 02:05:17.000
it purple.

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:20.560
That would be very funny. You gotta let Jason know that from Orange Launch Radio, that we

02:05:20.560 --> 02:05:26.400
want to make Xtreme 2 purple, if it happens, if it is Xtreme 2.

02:05:26.400 --> 02:05:30.040
Now some interesting news has been going around about Ultramix 2 is the song packs, they did

02:05:30.040 --> 02:05:33.200
say on The Freak that there's going to be what, 7 through 12 I think they said?

02:05:33.200 --> 02:05:34.200
Uh, yeah.

02:05:34.200 --> 02:05:35.200
What's going to happen?

02:05:35.200 --> 02:05:37.800
Maybe every month, every other month, we don't really know?

02:05:37.800 --> 02:05:42.240
I'll just say I wouldn't be surprised if they spaced them out a little longer than once

02:05:42.240 --> 02:05:43.240
a month.

02:05:43.240 --> 02:05:44.240
Okay.

02:05:44.240 --> 02:05:45.240
Yeah.

02:05:45.240 --> 02:05:46.400
Alright, well we're definitely looking at this.

02:05:46.400 --> 02:05:52.320
From what I've seen, there's definitely some very interesting choices, like things that

02:05:52.320 --> 02:05:54.280
the hardcore Bimani people would be very uh...

02:05:54.280 --> 02:05:56.680
Oh, so you know about some of the stuff that's coming up?

02:05:56.680 --> 02:05:57.720
Dude, I know everything.

02:05:57.720 --> 02:05:59.080
Oh, oh, sorry.

02:05:59.080 --> 02:06:01.200
Oh, watch out.

02:06:01.200 --> 02:06:02.880
All right.

02:06:02.880 --> 02:06:03.640
Yeah.

02:06:03.640 --> 02:06:05.680
All right, anything else you want to share we

02:06:05.680 --> 02:06:08.520
should be looking forward to from the world of Konami?

02:06:08.520 --> 02:06:10.680
It's kind of hard to say because, I mean,

02:06:10.680 --> 02:06:14.120
for all intents and purposes, everything's been released out

02:06:14.120 --> 02:06:16.280
for this fall.

02:06:16.280 --> 02:06:18.960
Probably the last game that's going to be pretty big

02:06:18.960 --> 02:06:21.920
for those who are into the RPGs 2 and 4 will

02:06:21.920 --> 02:06:24.040
be coming out early January.

02:06:24.040 --> 02:06:26.540
Cool. I got to play a demo with that, actually. It was pretty fun.

02:06:26.540 --> 02:06:30.340
Yeah, I mean, the only cool thing is, you know, I'll get to see my writing in there.

02:06:30.340 --> 02:06:31.440
Oh, very cool.

02:06:31.440 --> 02:06:37.440
Yeah, because me and another guy had actually helped do some translation or, like, rewriting for that project itself.

02:06:37.440 --> 02:06:39.040
Great.

02:06:39.040 --> 02:06:42.740
Yeah, that's the main stuff from Konami for now. I mean...

02:06:42.740 --> 02:06:46.540
Now, are you going to come back after Ultramix 2 is released?

02:06:46.540 --> 02:06:50.940
Are you going to come back to the show and kind of, you know, fill us in on how this happened and this...

02:06:50.940 --> 02:06:53.900
because now, you know, all the information will be out there. You get to tell us a little

02:06:53.900 --> 02:06:55.340
bit more about how it all happened, or?

02:06:55.340 --> 02:06:58.560
Oh, definitely. I mean, I'd be more than willing to, you know, come up here and talk about

02:06:58.560 --> 02:07:02.620
stories of, you know, like, songs and, like, who got to do this. I mean, you'll probably

02:07:02.620 --> 02:07:06.340
find out who did what steps and then, like, what caused us to think, you know, why we

02:07:06.340 --> 02:07:10.100
did that pattern and all that kind of stuff. There are definitely some interesting stories,

02:07:10.100 --> 02:07:14.500
and you'd be surprised at, like, some of the songs that people like on the V-Rays and stuff,

02:07:14.500 --> 02:07:18.300
but there were actually some testers who did not want to touch certain songs whatsoever.

02:07:18.300 --> 02:07:20.300
We're gonna have to hear about that.

02:07:20.300 --> 02:07:23.300
There's plenty of interesting gossip that will go down afterwards.

02:07:23.300 --> 02:07:29.300
Now if I'm not mistaken though, there's still about half the song list we don't even know yet still.

02:07:29.300 --> 02:07:36.300
Oh yeah, there's some things that people don't know about and there's a lot of funny things too.

02:07:36.300 --> 02:07:43.300
Although it kind of sucked in a way that the viewer had more or less spoiled some of the things we wanted to keep really top secret.

02:07:43.300 --> 02:07:48.300
You know what though? When you stop giving clues, we have nothing to do, so...

02:07:48.300 --> 02:07:53.300
And, you know, I mean, GameStop employees can't be quiet to save their lives.

02:07:53.300 --> 02:07:58.300
Are they ever gonna, you know, tell us, give us more clues, give us a song list here?

02:07:58.300 --> 02:08:00.300
Probably not, because we're only about ten days out.

02:08:00.300 --> 02:08:01.300
Nah, it just ain't happening.

02:08:01.300 --> 02:08:03.300
You're no fun. That's all right.

02:08:03.300 --> 02:08:08.300
Actually, I mean, it's, um, upper management has been really stressed out from UltraMix II,

02:08:08.300 --> 02:08:24.300
Ultramix 2, just trying to basically get it in before, you know, I mean our target date was actually probably the second week, basically around the same time Halo 2 was supposed to come out, you know, 11th we were looking at, but it got pushed back, but I mean, just kind of stuff happens in the business.

02:08:24.300 --> 02:08:33.300
So, you know, and it's also interesting because we've heard that some things change with Ultramix 2 as well, some song-less changes happen, some things behind the scenes, so, you know, maybe they had to go back and do something else.

02:08:33.300 --> 02:08:38.540
Yeah, I mean it's not uncommon to have one song one minute and then like a couple versions later

02:08:38.540 --> 02:08:43.900
Yeah, we decided not to have it. I mean people, you know, I think I mentioned one time about Dancing Stage Unleashed

02:08:43.900 --> 02:08:45.380
You know there was supposed to be

02:08:45.380 --> 02:08:51.140
You know like a certain song and then which is actually slated for was supposed to be for the US Max

02:08:51.140 --> 02:08:52.980
So I think those grooves into heart. Yeah, okay

02:08:52.980 --> 02:08:57.820
Yeah, it was supposed to be on US Max II but just never made it for one reason or another and I mean, of course

02:08:57.820 --> 02:09:01.660
You're probably never gonna hear from me about what songs didn't make it and it would actually

02:09:01.660 --> 02:09:05.580
Actually, sad part is I do have one to tell, but it just breaks my heart to even think

02:09:05.580 --> 02:09:06.580
about it.

02:09:06.580 --> 02:09:07.580
Oh, wow.

02:09:07.580 --> 02:09:09.060
It was really good, folks.

02:09:09.060 --> 02:09:10.060
Wow.

02:09:10.060 --> 02:09:11.060
Oh, yeah, you got me all...

02:09:11.060 --> 02:09:12.060
You're gonna have to...

02:09:12.060 --> 02:09:14.980
Now, see, in a year, nobody will care, so y'all have to tell us in a year.

02:09:14.980 --> 02:09:18.140
Unless someone shoots me up with some, like, sodium pentothal or something like that.

02:09:18.140 --> 02:09:19.140
I think we can arrange that.

02:09:19.140 --> 02:09:20.140
All right.

02:09:20.140 --> 02:09:21.140
Well, thanks for coming by, Mel.

02:09:21.140 --> 02:09:22.380
You're welcome back anytime, of course.

02:09:22.380 --> 02:09:23.380
Oh, always.

02:09:23.380 --> 02:09:24.380
It's always a blast up here.

02:09:24.380 --> 02:09:25.380
And good luck with Spot.

02:09:25.380 --> 02:09:26.380
Let us know when Spot relaunches.

02:09:26.380 --> 02:09:30.340
Yeah, I'll definitely drop you a line probably in the next Orange Lounge chat or whatever,

02:09:30.340 --> 02:09:35.700
Then we'll probably announce what our contest will be in DDR Spot for the Kira CDs.

02:09:35.700 --> 02:09:39.420
I mean, one will probably be, just to kind of give a teaser to people, it'll probably

02:09:39.420 --> 02:09:43.740
involve something about fan art dealing with Silent Hill 4.

02:09:43.740 --> 02:09:45.220
Ooh, get your pens ready.

02:09:45.220 --> 02:09:49.260
So we'll have like some kind of certain theme plotted out and then see what people can do

02:09:49.260 --> 02:09:50.260
with it.

02:09:50.260 --> 02:09:54.860
And kind of off topic, my own personal plug, I'm going to be selling a Silent Hill 4 stand

02:09:54.860 --> 02:09:56.180
up display.

02:09:56.180 --> 02:10:01.400
If anyone wants it, uh, I'll be putting it somewhere on someplace and I'll sell it or

02:10:01.400 --> 02:10:02.400
whatever.

02:10:02.400 --> 02:10:05.460
I'll probably post it on to LiveJournal, um, Silent Hill Forum.

02:10:05.460 --> 02:10:06.860
Alright, Vanessa.

02:10:06.860 --> 02:10:07.860
Sharks Girl?

02:10:07.860 --> 02:10:08.860
Yeah?

02:10:08.860 --> 02:10:12.020
I just, I didn't want to neglect you, you're sitting there and you look kinda, you know,

02:10:12.020 --> 02:10:13.020
bored.

02:10:13.020 --> 02:10:14.020
No, I'm kidding.

02:10:14.020 --> 02:10:15.020
No, I just feel kinda hot, so.

02:10:15.020 --> 02:10:18.140
It is kinda hot in here, but I, any exciting plans?

02:10:18.140 --> 02:10:20.900
Any exciting plans for the next few weeks for you?

02:10:20.900 --> 02:10:25.900
Try not to murder my fellow co-workers that I can't stand.

02:10:25.900 --> 02:10:29.900
Try not to walk out on my job because I really need money. That's about it.

02:10:29.900 --> 02:10:32.900
Well, I want to come down now. We're going to have a Dave & Buster's Play Day pretty soon.

02:10:32.900 --> 02:10:34.900
And we can harass a new friend of mine who works there.

02:10:34.900 --> 02:10:36.900
Yay, harassment! I like that idea.

02:10:36.900 --> 02:10:37.900
Harassment is fun.

02:10:37.900 --> 02:10:40.900
And what else am I going to ask you? How's hockey going?

02:10:40.900 --> 02:10:41.900
Oh, God.

02:10:41.900 --> 02:10:43.900
Does it look like it might get better?

02:10:43.900 --> 02:10:46.900
No. They're being stupid morons. The players are being idiots.

02:10:46.900 --> 02:10:51.660
It's from what I hear from friends who actually have contacts in the upper level of sharks

02:10:51.660 --> 02:10:57.060
management, the owners are willing to negotiate and work on it and the players aren't.

02:10:57.060 --> 02:11:02.700
They're saying we want what we want, too damn bad, so from what I hear the sharks are planning

02:11:02.700 --> 02:11:08.820
that there won't be a season this year, which pisses me off, but it saves my wallet, so

02:11:08.820 --> 02:11:09.820
you know hey.

02:11:09.820 --> 02:11:10.820
I guess there's a bright side.

02:11:10.820 --> 02:11:12.780
So yeah, it could be all bad.

02:11:12.780 --> 02:11:15.760
Well if there is a season, like a partial season, like they ended up doing with baseball

02:11:15.760 --> 02:11:22.520
or something. Hope your Sharks can win it. Hey, we're undefeated! Woo! Nothing, nothing.

02:11:22.520 --> 02:11:28.080
We rule. It's just like our match game tonight. Very good. Alright. Are you guys sticking

02:11:28.080 --> 02:11:33.520
around? Are you guys going to be taken off too, or? Okay, because I want to talk to WannaGirl

02:11:33.520 --> 02:11:36.300
when we get back about a promotion she got recently. I want to talk to her about what's

02:11:36.300 --> 02:11:40.440
going on with the Freaks, so we'll talk about that when we get back. So we are going to

02:11:40.440 --> 02:11:46.280
another break. How about some more 2DX Red stuff? Navi, as our kind of resident whore

02:11:46.280 --> 02:11:50.760
who knows a little bit more about this stuff, why don't you pick some songs for us that

02:11:50.760 --> 02:12:00.760
you want our chat room to hear? Which one? What's the... Okay, we're going to hear Horizon

02:12:00.760 --> 02:12:07.520
and what else do you want to hear? We're going to hear Death Disco, Texture. I'm sorry, it's

02:12:07.520 --> 02:12:14.520
Lake with texture.

02:12:37.520 --> 02:12:41.520
I can't seriously think about calling in tomorrow, but you know, hey.

02:12:41.520 --> 02:12:46.520
Someday, someday we're going to bring the show over there to your neck of the woods.

02:12:46.520 --> 02:12:49.520
We've got to someday. Someday when we have a three-day weekend.

02:12:49.520 --> 02:12:52.520
Footwalk, any pre-emptive FUs you've got to get out for?

02:12:52.520 --> 02:12:57.520
Oh man, well, I guess just FU2.

02:12:57.520 --> 02:13:02.520
Just FU2, like game companies point out too many damn games and just, man,

02:13:02.520 --> 02:13:06.560
basically for not giving me enough time to play everything

02:13:06.560 --> 02:13:10.080
and FU2 on my new job, I was supposed to start Monday but

02:13:10.080 --> 02:13:13.300
they said they couldn't start me till Wednesday and

02:13:13.300 --> 02:13:17.100
whatever hurts my bank account really just makes it go FU

02:13:17.100 --> 02:13:21.460
I hear that. Alright guys thanks for coming we'll see you later okay?

02:13:21.460 --> 02:13:24.440
Almost definitely, the sooner the better. Have a good one. Here we go we're gonna go to break

02:13:24.440 --> 02:13:26.120
we'll be back, show's not over yet though

02:13:26.120 --> 02:13:28.940
we're just losing a couple people because they got a long drive but we got plenty of show

02:13:28.940 --> 02:13:35.940
left we'll be back

02:15:28.940 --> 02:15:30.940
You

02:16:28.940 --> 02:16:32.940
Ain't no love to be free

02:16:33.940 --> 02:16:36.940
But it's all me

02:16:38.940 --> 02:16:40.940
But I know

02:16:41.940 --> 02:16:44.940
There's no reason

02:19:14.940 --> 02:19:38.940
Orange Lounge Radio, we put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.

02:19:38.940 --> 02:19:43.500
It's server made a bit my dad number it's server made a bit my dad number

02:19:43.820 --> 02:19:49.780
We are back here on orange lounge radio. We gotta get the cages by sharks girl. Bye for a walk. Have a good one

02:19:49.780 --> 02:19:54.980
Thanks for coming. Um, they got a long drive back guys. So they're good sports for coming all the way down here to

02:19:55.680 --> 02:19:57.680
Come on our show and eat Mongolian

02:19:58.900 --> 02:20:02.140
Cuz Mongolians are yummy. We've got a whole lot of show laughs

02:20:02.140 --> 02:20:04.060
We gotta get to the cage nice gotta get the F use of the week

02:20:04.060 --> 02:20:06.900
But you know, we have we haven't really gotten it. There's so many guests here tonight

02:20:06.900 --> 02:20:10.900
We haven't really gotten to talk to a lot of them, so I wanted to say hello to Iguana Girl real fast.

02:20:10.900 --> 02:20:11.400
Hi.

02:20:11.400 --> 02:20:16.400
And you just recently got a promotion over on that one DDR site I've heard of.

02:20:16.400 --> 02:20:19.400
Yeah, yeah, that place. Yeah, yeah.

02:20:19.400 --> 02:20:21.400
We adoringly call it The Freak.

02:20:21.400 --> 02:20:21.900
Yeah.

02:20:21.900 --> 02:20:22.900
The DDR Freak.

02:20:22.900 --> 02:20:28.900
Yeah, it's not like a huge thing, but yeah, I'm the head administrator over at DDR Freak now, so...

02:20:28.900 --> 02:20:30.900
But that doesn't mean you replaced J-Dog.

02:20:30.900 --> 02:20:33.400
No, no, no, no, no. Basically...

02:20:33.400 --> 02:20:40.000
King of all cosmos, aka Spike, has not been able to put the amount of time into the site

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:45.680
that he would want to, so he decided to step down and I was put into his place, so now

02:20:45.680 --> 02:20:50.440
basically I'm helping out with the forums and keeping things hunky-dory on the forums

02:20:50.440 --> 02:20:51.440
and whatnot.

02:20:51.440 --> 02:20:53.560
It's a hell of an undertaking, I bet.

02:20:53.560 --> 02:20:58.480
Yeah, we've got a lot of projects that we're working on right now and trying to get squared

02:20:58.480 --> 02:21:03.720
away so so yeah it's a lot of stuff to do but I've got such a wonderful crew

02:21:03.720 --> 02:21:08.240
that I'm working with I mean everybody's just fabulous to work with so includes

02:21:08.240 --> 02:21:11.520
our very own dark side yes as well as Islanders and next to you over there yes

02:21:11.520 --> 02:21:15.400
he's our staff members several folks listening tonight I'm fast but judging

02:21:15.400 --> 02:21:18.480
from our chat so hi you guys thanks for listening tonight the exchange next be

02:21:18.480 --> 02:21:22.480
in Sherlock yes of course Jason I know I saw Sherlock blue in there earlier this

02:21:22.480 --> 02:21:26.680
is great thank you guys for listening and I know you probably can't say a

02:21:26.680 --> 02:21:30.320
whole lot, but anything exciting coming to The Freak in the near future you might look

02:21:30.320 --> 02:21:31.320
forward to?

02:21:31.320 --> 02:21:35.120
Um, I can't really say anything about it right now.

02:21:35.120 --> 02:21:36.120
Okay, that's fine.

02:21:36.120 --> 02:21:41.560
There's a lot of stuff that's really up in the air, but don't be surprised if you start

02:21:41.560 --> 02:21:43.440
seeing some changes around the site.

02:21:43.440 --> 02:21:45.640
Ooh, that's always a good one to leave people with.

02:21:45.640 --> 02:21:46.640
Yeah, yeah.

02:21:46.640 --> 02:21:48.360
How did you get involved with that anyway?

02:21:48.360 --> 02:21:54.120
Because you know, I remember that you and I, we had our first DDR experience together

02:21:54.120 --> 02:21:56.040
Yes, October 2000, yeah.

02:21:56.040 --> 02:21:59.920
And then about a year after that, we weren't talking to each other, then suddenly, suddenly

02:21:59.920 --> 02:22:04.000
you were running up the corporate ladder, a DDR freak, out in the open.

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:05.000
What happened?

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:08.560
Well, I, you know, just through the site, I mean, back in the old boards, you know,

02:22:08.560 --> 02:22:14.020
the green boards, as we, you know, affectionately call them, I started to get to know some people,

02:22:14.020 --> 02:22:19.040
and Jamie and I were becoming really, really close friends, and what ended up happening

02:22:19.040 --> 02:22:25.540
was she introduced me to some other people, which introduced me to some other people,

02:22:25.540 --> 02:22:36.160
which ended up basically with me speaking with Sinan, with Pock Eye Kenobi, and he ended

02:22:36.160 --> 02:22:43.000
up going in and we chatted and after some conversations and such, what was it, around

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:48.560
Miggle 2, the Milpitas Golf Land Tournament 2, was when he decided that, you know,

02:22:48.560 --> 02:22:51.240
hey, let's make you a mod and blah, blah, blah.

02:22:51.240 --> 02:22:57.000
I remember seeing the nomination thread and being so proud.

02:22:57.000 --> 02:23:00.280
See, I never, I don't even remember any of that, but...

02:23:00.280 --> 02:23:03.720
I was surprised because it was just, it was, you know, out of the blue for me, but...

02:23:03.720 --> 02:23:05.520
Well, good job. Congratulations to you.

02:23:05.520 --> 02:23:08.120
Yeah, that was August 2001.

02:23:08.120 --> 02:23:13.680
Out of curiosity, now there have been several mods on DDRFreak that don't, you know, mod

02:23:13.680 --> 02:23:18.720
anymore basically. How many of the mods that were there when you started are still there?

02:23:18.720 --> 02:23:21.560
I know Jamie's one. Islander's one.

02:23:21.560 --> 02:23:23.680
Yeah, well, no, he's staff now.

02:23:23.680 --> 02:23:24.680
Oh, he's staff.

02:23:24.680 --> 02:23:25.680
That was one of the projects that was undertaken.

02:23:25.680 --> 02:23:26.680
My bad, my bad. Sorry guys, my bad.

02:23:26.680 --> 02:23:34.440
One of my projects was getting a lot of the ineffective mods, unfortunately. Yeah, so,

02:23:34.440 --> 02:23:39.240
We've moved a lot of people over to staff because there's still definitely a benefit

02:23:39.240 --> 02:23:43.120
to the site, but they're not able to put the time towards the site.

02:23:43.120 --> 02:23:46.120
Sort of recognize what they've done.

02:23:46.120 --> 02:23:48.560
We still appreciate all of their input.

02:23:48.560 --> 02:23:54.920
It's not like they are suddenly dumb because they're not mods or something like that.

02:23:54.920 --> 02:24:00.960
We appreciate their input and we appreciate every bit of advice and instruction they can

02:24:00.960 --> 02:24:10.440
give us and the like, but honestly, I can't think of too many people.

02:24:10.440 --> 02:24:14.280
Somebody was mentioning that to me the other day, I thought that was kind of interesting.

02:24:14.280 --> 02:24:22.720
Yeah, I think that there's Jamie and I'm trying to think.

02:24:22.720 --> 02:24:23.720
J-Dog?

02:24:23.720 --> 02:24:28.080
Well, J-Dog, he owns the site, so that doesn't really count.

02:24:28.080 --> 02:24:29.080
Interesting, very interesting.

02:24:29.080 --> 02:24:32.080
Um, what else do I want to ask you?

02:24:32.080 --> 02:24:37.080
Okay, now, just between you and me, because nobody listens to this show, okay?

02:24:37.080 --> 02:24:41.080
Which forum is the biggest bitch to handle?

02:24:41.080 --> 02:24:44.080
Um, see, that's the funny thing, is everybody else...

02:24:44.080 --> 02:24:50.080
Yeah, see, Mr. Islander is, you know, coffee gunner is with Random Chat,

02:24:50.080 --> 02:24:52.080
but I don't mind Random Chat.

02:24:52.080 --> 02:24:53.080
Random Chat's fun.

02:24:53.080 --> 02:24:56.080
I like Random Chat. I mean, it's like the evolution.

02:24:56.080 --> 02:24:58.080
I do too, but I refuse to get involved in political discussions.

02:24:58.080 --> 02:25:04.960
You see, here's my problem. My most hated forum would be DDR chit-chat, because that's

02:25:04.960 --> 02:25:09.960
where you get all of the newbies going, oh my god, DDR is so much fun, I love it, oh

02:25:09.960 --> 02:25:15.520
my god! And yeah, I can't hang with that.

02:25:15.520 --> 02:25:19.320
I'm going to tape that and send you a DDR Freak promo or something.

02:25:19.320 --> 02:25:24.000
Yeah, I just can't hang with that. I can't deal with that every single day.

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:29.920
It's weird. You are the... DDR Freak is visited by gazillions of people. That's an official

02:25:29.920 --> 02:25:34.800
record. Gazillions of people. How much do you play DDR anymore?

02:25:34.800 --> 02:25:41.800
I don't. Unless you count Thumb Thumb Revolution, I have not played DDR in 2004.

02:25:43.680 --> 02:25:46.560
How many of those mods actually play DDR? Quite a few.

02:25:46.560 --> 02:25:49.920
Really? Surprisingly enough, actually it's about a

02:25:49.920 --> 02:25:53.160
three-quarter split, I would imagine. So here's the logical follow-up question.

02:25:53.160 --> 02:25:56.160
If you don't play DDR anymore, what the hell are you doing?

02:25:56.160 --> 02:25:57.160
It's the community.

02:25:57.160 --> 02:25:58.160
It's the community.

02:25:58.160 --> 02:26:01.160
All of you dumb fucks out there, I love you to death!

02:26:01.160 --> 02:26:02.160
I'm kidding.

02:26:02.160 --> 02:26:04.160
You pissed me off, but I love you.

02:26:04.160 --> 02:26:05.160
I love you, goodnight.

02:26:05.160 --> 02:26:07.160
No, no, seriously.

02:26:07.160 --> 02:26:11.160
That's what drew me to it, to begin with.

02:26:11.160 --> 02:26:13.160
It was just like Rocky for me.

02:26:13.160 --> 02:26:19.160
I started out with Rocky because it seemed like it was fun, I get to go dance and sing

02:26:19.160 --> 02:26:22.160
and all that fun jazz and whatnot on stage.

02:26:22.160 --> 02:26:29.440
stage, but what kept me there, despite everything else, was the community, the family that you

02:26:29.440 --> 02:26:36.040
grow from it, and that's honestly been the best experience about DDR for me, was the

02:26:36.040 --> 02:26:44.120
camaraderie that I've felt this big, huge, happy family that has all of its fucked up

02:26:44.120 --> 02:26:45.600
drama from time to time.

02:26:45.600 --> 02:26:51.580
I absolutely agree on this, especially with this little bastardist, cancerous community

02:26:51.580 --> 02:26:57.120
we've created here on Orange Lounge. I just, I love it. And you know what though? One day,

02:26:57.120 --> 02:27:01.160
Orange Lounge, not going to be able to just be Bemani anymore. I think someday we're going

02:27:01.160 --> 02:27:03.880
to get, we're going to outgrow our shoes. We're going to have to grow to video gaming.

02:27:03.880 --> 02:27:07.200
So, I'm looking forward to hopefully being able to work with some stuff, you know, now

02:27:07.200 --> 02:27:11.920
that we're cool again. Especially being able to work with some stuff with DDR Freak and,

02:27:11.920 --> 02:27:19.400
you know, because. And oh my God, maybe, Orange Lounge and DDR Freak Radio Crossovers? I didn't

02:27:19.400 --> 02:27:25.760
say that I didn't say it but I'm not I'm not they're gonna I'm not they're gonna

02:27:25.760 --> 02:27:32.920
confirm nor deny those reports we shall soon see it could be some interesting

02:27:32.920 --> 02:27:38.840
things happening this November we'll see possibly possibly all right well Islander

02:27:38.840 --> 02:27:41.880
I got I don't want to leave you out of the fun because we're talking about a

02:27:41.880 --> 02:27:46.920
girl but how did you know you were one of the first people on DDR freak would

02:27:46.920 --> 02:27:54.080
you? Yes. How did this whole damn phenomenon get started? Well, the story goes, there was

02:27:54.080 --> 02:28:00.960
a group of guys that I saw playing DDR, you know, way back in the day at Milpitas Golf

02:28:00.960 --> 02:28:04.840
Land, the first time I ever saw this machine, and I started noticing, I started seeing the

02:28:04.840 --> 02:28:10.680
same people over and over again, like, i.e. Floatwalk, who was just here, at least, who

02:28:10.680 --> 02:28:18.680
left actually, J-Dog, Pokai Kenobi, and we started talking to one another, and we started

02:28:18.680 --> 02:28:26.920
seeing each other more and more and more. Next thing I know, Jason comes up with a website

02:28:26.920 --> 02:28:33.960
with a huge long URL. It was something at Berkeley, at EDU, and da da da da da da da.

02:28:33.960 --> 02:28:35.560
Sad thing is, I remember that site.

02:28:35.560 --> 02:28:37.640
You remember that? It was, oh, it was horrible.

02:28:37.640 --> 02:28:41.640
No, when I first... NS3 was the NS3 site that we came on board with.

02:28:41.640 --> 02:28:49.640
Yeah, the NS3.net was next. And just kind of progressed from there, how quickly people caught on and how much people loved it.

02:28:49.640 --> 02:28:54.640
And it's really amazing how much the site has really grown.

02:28:54.640 --> 02:28:58.640
It is amazing. I mean, my god.

02:28:58.640 --> 02:29:00.640
45,000 members.

02:29:00.640 --> 02:29:02.640
How many hits a day?

02:29:02.640 --> 02:29:06.240
I wouldn't even know what the stats are, to be honest, but let me put it this way, the

02:29:06.240 --> 02:29:11.720
reason why we can't keep the video section up is the sheer amount of bandwidth that is

02:29:11.720 --> 02:29:18.040
used would cost us probably a good $500 a month in hosting fees alone.

02:29:18.040 --> 02:29:19.040
Now I got a good idea.

02:29:19.040 --> 02:29:20.040
At least.

02:29:20.040 --> 02:29:21.040
At least.

02:29:21.040 --> 02:29:22.440
You guys should do one of those Winamp TV things for streaming videos.

02:29:22.440 --> 02:29:23.440
Hmm.

02:29:23.440 --> 02:29:24.440
You're kind of cute.

02:29:24.440 --> 02:29:25.440
Maybe.

02:29:25.440 --> 02:29:27.240
Just remember, I suggested it, okay?

02:29:27.240 --> 02:29:29.280
I want my credit.

02:29:29.280 --> 02:29:34.900
And a lot of people have suggested BitTorrent for it, but part of the problem with that

02:29:34.900 --> 02:29:41.580
is A, we're talking about, you know, the common user here, and a lot of common users aren't

02:29:41.580 --> 02:29:42.900
going to be able to figure out BitTorrent.

02:29:42.900 --> 02:29:43.900
Yet.

02:29:43.900 --> 02:29:44.900
At least right now.

02:29:44.900 --> 02:29:45.900
Yeah.

02:29:45.900 --> 02:29:46.900
At least for right now.

02:29:46.900 --> 02:29:49.460
I mean, obviously, you know, things like IRC were foreign to people back in the day, but...

02:29:49.460 --> 02:29:53.500
If you haven't guessed, DDR Freecast to cater to the lowest common denominator sometimes.

02:29:53.500 --> 02:29:54.500
Yes, unfortunately.

02:29:54.500 --> 02:29:55.500
I was in...

02:29:55.500 --> 02:29:58.700
No, I'm going to be high school.

02:29:58.700 --> 02:30:03.700
I wasn't going to name names, I was just going to say complete idiots, but you know.

02:30:03.700 --> 02:30:06.700
Or, you know, as she said, the newbies, which I actually love!

02:30:06.700 --> 02:30:07.700
Because that was one of my...

02:30:07.700 --> 02:30:08.700
Some newbies are cute!

02:30:08.700 --> 02:30:10.700
Well, no, because that was my...

02:30:10.700 --> 02:30:12.700
That used to be... exactly.

02:30:12.700 --> 02:30:16.700
If you go to the site, I am still listed as the DDR Amsobor.

02:30:16.700 --> 02:30:17.700
Amsobor.

02:30:17.700 --> 02:30:19.700
Ambassador, misspelled.

02:30:19.700 --> 02:30:21.700
But anyway, because I loved going...

02:30:21.700 --> 02:30:27.700
See, one of the things I loved to do way back when was I loved to go to various arcades, talk to people, get them interested,

02:30:27.700 --> 02:30:32.700
And I just loved going around meeting people who played the game.

02:30:32.700 --> 02:30:37.700
For example, when the Sacramento crew came down to the Bay Area...

02:30:37.700 --> 02:30:40.700
And everybody hated us. Remember that?

02:30:40.700 --> 02:30:43.700
Isn't that funny, iguana girl? I just want to point this out.

02:30:43.700 --> 02:30:50.700
We were the bastard children of the DDR community for the longest time, and now she's the queen of the goddamn forum.

02:30:50.700 --> 02:30:54.700
I just want to point that out. That is hilarious to me.

02:30:54.700 --> 02:30:58.700
Meanwhile, the people that chastise us, chastise us are banned!

02:30:58.700 --> 02:31:10.700
Exactly, exactly. But I mean, I was, I made a trip down there to meet you guys and see who else played the game and kind of meet everyone and kind of went from there.

02:31:10.700 --> 02:31:15.700
First time I met Jess and Jamie and you were there as well.

02:31:15.700 --> 02:31:25.180
I believe, just looking at the chat room, I do remember seeing Tetsuya there, a few

02:31:25.180 --> 02:31:26.180
other people.

02:31:26.180 --> 02:31:27.180
I remember Prestige.

02:31:27.180 --> 02:31:29.340
Yes, yes, he was there too.

02:31:29.340 --> 02:31:31.220
Wow, a lot of names.

02:31:31.220 --> 02:31:35.700
And you were there, and you were there, and you were there.

02:31:35.700 --> 02:31:36.700
Exactly.

02:31:36.700 --> 02:31:37.700
Alright.

02:31:37.700 --> 02:31:38.700
Yeah.

02:31:38.700 --> 02:31:41.700
And he said I had big tits.

02:31:41.700 --> 02:31:42.700
Alright.

02:31:42.700 --> 02:31:46.260
alright are we gonna get what i i think i think that this or the you guys are

02:31:46.260 --> 02:31:47.680

02:31:47.680 --> 02:31:50.440
uh... you're you're actually welcome in the south again and i think that all my

02:31:50.440 --> 02:31:54.300
god i'm just you know i'm just messing with it we've got a lot of this that we

02:31:54.300 --> 02:31:57.320
can just be candid about it it's only life's funny

02:31:57.320 --> 02:31:59.040
at the footballs and it

02:31:59.040 --> 02:32:00.420
things change right

02:32:00.420 --> 02:32:02.100
i doubt that there should go anywhere nanny

02:32:02.100 --> 02:32:04.880
cuz i want to talk to you still till after we get the cage measure we got to

02:32:04.880 --> 02:32:08.880
get a little guy thirty minutes left in the show

02:32:08.880 --> 02:32:12.160
Did Jamie just say we skip FUs?

02:32:12.160 --> 02:32:15.640
We should skip FUs so that next week I can do double FUs.

02:32:15.640 --> 02:32:18.800
I don't know about that, Jamie. Maybe we'll have to do a mini FU segment.

02:32:18.800 --> 02:32:22.280
Everybody will have to think of like one really good FU. One really good FU. And that goes for

02:32:22.280 --> 02:32:23.840
chat room too. You only get one

02:32:23.840 --> 02:32:28.160
really good FU tonight, okay? But in the meanwhile, we've got to, got to, got to get to

02:32:28.160 --> 02:32:29.560
tonight's cage match.

02:32:29.560 --> 02:32:33.600
So I'm going to queue it up here and if you want to participate in tonight's cage

02:32:33.600 --> 02:32:34.160
match,

02:32:34.160 --> 02:32:37.920
all you got to do is head on over to our chat room over at

02:32:37.920 --> 02:32:44.240
orange lounge radio dot com and click on chat so let's bring on uh... the cage

alright we'll see what happens we'll see what happens anything's possible

02:33:06.240 --> 02:33:08.240
Let's see how fast we can get through this cage match.

02:33:08.240 --> 02:33:11.240
Last week in the Orange Lawn's cage match, it didn't happen because we weren't here,

02:33:11.240 --> 02:33:12.240
because we had Halloween.

02:33:12.240 --> 02:33:15.240
So, for two weeks running, you have had my pick.

02:33:15.240 --> 02:33:18.240
My pick was the winner of the Orange Lawn's radio cage match.

02:33:18.240 --> 02:33:23.240
It was a song by Ian Van Dow, which you know from Castles in the Sky, Will.i.

02:33:23.240 --> 02:33:25.240
He had a brand new single, it's called Reason,

02:33:25.240 --> 02:33:28.240
and it was the winner of last week's Orange Lawn's, or two weeks ago's,

02:33:28.240 --> 02:33:29.240
Orange Lawn's radio cage match.

02:33:29.240 --> 02:33:33.240
Again, the way the cage match works, we're going to play three songs for you guys,

02:33:33.240 --> 02:33:38.580
A clip of last week's winner and two new songs for you guys in full that each host selects

02:33:38.580 --> 02:33:43.580
You guys vote for your favorite and the winner goes into rotation all week long on

02:33:43.980 --> 02:33:49.360
Orange lounge radios the money music amor program with EDR to the X all that fun stuff and also

02:33:50.180 --> 02:33:54.980
The whole guest here we get to do our best time in town on all the songs that play except for last week's because we

02:33:54.980 --> 02:34:00.660
Already did it last week. So alright, I'll shut up and play a clip of song number one. It is last week's winner

02:34:00.660 --> 02:34:02.660
It's Reason by Iain Bandel.

02:34:30.660 --> 02:34:40.660
Tell me the truth Is there something on your mind?

02:34:40.660 --> 02:34:48.660
Tell me what you hide inside Tell me the truth

02:34:48.660 --> 02:34:55.660
Give me a reason To hold onto what we've got

02:34:55.660 --> 02:35:02.660
There must be a reason to hold on to what we've got

02:35:02.660 --> 02:35:09.660
Give me a reason to hold on to what we've got

02:35:09.660 --> 02:35:16.660
There must be a reason to hold on to what we've got

02:35:19.660 --> 02:35:23.660
Are there things that I should know?

02:35:23.660 --> 02:35:27.660
Will you stay or will you go?

02:35:27.660 --> 02:35:43.660
Okay, that was song number one, last week's winner, or two weeks ago's winner, I should

02:35:43.660 --> 02:35:44.660
say.

02:35:44.660 --> 02:35:48.380
That was Ian Van Dow from the album, Ape with Reason, some happy, poppy trance music.

02:35:48.380 --> 02:35:49.380
Jamie's favorite.

02:35:49.380 --> 02:35:53.700
You gave that song an eight, I just wanted to remind you.

02:35:53.700 --> 02:35:54.700
All right.

02:35:54.700 --> 02:35:55.700
Yes, you did.

02:35:55.700 --> 02:36:00.700
Let's go on, and we're gonna go to Loki's pick for tonight. Loki, what'd you pick out tonight?

02:36:00.700 --> 02:36:05.700
Well, I figured I'd get something really sweet for you guys.

02:36:05.700 --> 02:36:13.700
Earlier in the show, you heard me mention Midihead, basically the guy that did the really kick-ass remix of In Your Eyes.

02:36:13.700 --> 02:36:22.700
And, well, I got another track from him. You won't even find this on his website, because I asked him for it, and he was nice enough to send to me.

02:36:22.700 --> 02:36:24.700
And your internet penis is humongous.

02:36:24.700 --> 02:36:25.700
Yes it is.

02:36:25.700 --> 02:36:32.700
Anyways, this song is featured in one of the trailers, or not, I should say TV spots for Matrix Reloaded.

02:36:32.700 --> 02:36:37.700
And the song is called, um, how was it, Speed Demon.

02:36:37.700 --> 02:36:42.700
And it's by a group, or a guy called Monolithic, and guess who Monolithic is?

02:36:42.700 --> 02:36:45.700
It's Midi Head, and he's the singer, and enjoy.

02:36:45.700 --> 02:36:50.700
Alright, here it is. Song number two tonight. Monolithic, Speed Demon. Enjoy.

02:37:15.700 --> 02:37:24.700
The sun is going down in the west sky And I'm feeling up on a big high

02:37:24.700 --> 02:37:31.700
Wanna get in my car and fly away, fly away, go play

02:37:31.700 --> 02:37:38.700
Turn the key and drop the pedal Gonna keep it down to metal

02:37:38.700 --> 02:37:44.700
Fighting down the open highway, highway, my way

02:37:44.700 --> 02:37:51.700
Are you ready to fly?

02:38:14.700 --> 02:38:23.700
The engine hums as I roll down the window I love the solitude as I feel the wind blow

02:38:23.700 --> 02:38:29.700
With the stereo on and the volume turned on Way off

02:38:29.700 --> 02:38:36.700
The road it winds holding tight to the wheel Got the pedal still slammed through the steel

02:38:36.700 --> 02:38:43.700
I hear the squeal of the tires as they burn up, burn up, burn up

02:39:06.700 --> 02:39:32.180
The sun is going down in the west sky And I'm feeling up, I'm a-be-high

02:39:32.180 --> 02:39:38.840
Wanna' get in my car and fly away, fly away, hey, fly away

02:39:39.840 --> 02:39:45.920
Turn the key and drop the pedal Gonna' keep it down to metal

02:39:45.920 --> 02:39:52.920
Fly down the old big highway Highway, my way

02:39:52.920 --> 02:39:55.860
Gotta' speed team put the pedal down Put the pedal down, put the pedal down

02:39:55.860 --> 02:39:59.160
Gotta' speed team put the pedal down Put the pedal down, to the ground

02:39:59.160 --> 02:40:02.040
Gotta' speed team put the pedal down Put the pedal down, put the pedal down

02:40:02.040 --> 02:40:05.040
Put the pedal down, put the pedal down, put the pedal down

02:40:05.040 --> 02:40:07.040
If you just bow

02:40:35.040 --> 02:40:42.040
Give me your smile

02:40:42.040 --> 02:40:48.040
Give me your smile

02:40:48.040 --> 02:40:55.040
Give me your smile

02:40:55.040 --> 02:40:59.040
You are theur Baldwin!

02:40:59.040 --> 02:41:02.040
You are theur Baldwin!

02:41:02.040 --> 02:41:06.040
You are theur Baldwin!

02:41:06.040 --> 02:41:09.040
You are theur Baldwin!

02:41:09.040 --> 02:41:12.040
You are theur Baldwin!

02:41:12.040 --> 02:41:16.040
You are theur Baldwin!

02:41:19.040 --> 02:41:23.040
You are theur Baldwin!

02:41:23.040 --> 02:41:38.200
Okay, that was song number two in tonight's cage match.

02:41:38.200 --> 02:41:41.800
That was Monolithic with Speed Demon, and we're going to go around and see what everybody

02:41:41.800 --> 02:41:42.800
thought of that one.

02:41:42.800 --> 02:41:46.560
Keep in mind, we're all a little pooped right now, so I don't know how that may affect the

02:41:46.560 --> 02:41:47.560
scores, but let's see.

02:41:47.560 --> 02:41:48.560
Dark Sakura.

02:41:48.560 --> 02:41:49.560
It's not bad.

02:41:49.560 --> 02:41:51.560
Not bad.

02:41:53.560 --> 02:41:55.560
I'd give it a...

02:41:56.560 --> 02:41:58.560
Seven and a half.

02:41:58.560 --> 02:42:00.560
Alright, seven and a half. What's the, uh, iguana girl?

02:42:00.560 --> 02:42:05.560
Sounds like the type of stuff I actually used to listen to, so, um, I'm probably good about seven and a half also.

02:42:05.560 --> 02:42:07.560
Alright, seven and a half iguana girl. Uh, islander?

02:42:08.560 --> 02:42:12.560
Honestly, not my style, but I still enjoyed it anyway. I'd probably still give it a seven.

02:42:12.560 --> 02:42:14.560
Alright, good deal. Uh, Navi?

02:42:14.560 --> 02:42:21.560
The music was pretty good, but then the vocals kind of ruined it for me, sound like Bad Underworld with a cowboy twang, so I give it 7.

02:42:21.560 --> 02:42:23.560
Uh, RKDN.

02:42:24.560 --> 02:42:28.560
Yeah, the background was good, but the guy's saying, leave something to desire, 2.5.

02:42:29.560 --> 02:42:40.560
Um, I've always, you know, I think Midihead's a really talented guy, um, I prefer the In My Eyes remix over that, but uh, it's got a good beat, I think cut down a little bit, that would be like a fun little 2DX song or something.

02:42:40.560 --> 02:42:47.560
or something. Yeah, right. 2DX is going to come out here. So I give it a 7.5 as well.

02:42:47.560 --> 02:42:54.560
Why not? I'll be trending. It's better with the Matrix reloaded visuals with it, but I

02:42:54.560 --> 02:42:59.560
still give it a 9. This is awesome. Alright, remember, it doesn't matter what we think.

02:42:59.560 --> 02:43:04.560
It's all up to you guys. You can choose between Ian Van Dau, that song, and Dark Sakura Song,

02:43:04.560 --> 02:43:06.560
Which we're going to hear next. Dark Sacro, what is it?

02:43:06.560 --> 02:43:14.560
It's by someone named Vlad. It's Supersonic Electronics.

02:43:14.560 --> 02:43:15.560
Okay.

02:43:15.560 --> 02:43:21.560
If anyone happens to be checking random chat on GDR3, they'll know what I was talking about.

02:43:21.560 --> 02:43:29.560
I'm a little concerned, but we'll see. All right. This is Vlad with Electronic Supersonic. Enjoy.

02:43:29.560 --> 02:43:38.240
Hey baby, wake up from your sleep, we have arrived onto the future and the whole world

02:43:38.240 --> 02:43:51.240
is become electronic, supersonic, supersonic, electronic.

02:43:51.240 --> 02:43:58.160
Hey baby, ride with me away, we doesn't have much time, my blue jeans is tight, so onto

02:43:58.160 --> 02:44:04.840
my love rocket climb. Inside tank of fuel is not fuel but love. Above us there is nothing

02:44:04.840 --> 02:44:16.640
above but the stars above. All systems gone, pay pay for down count. 5, 4, 3, 1, off blast.

02:44:16.640 --> 02:44:25.440
Fly away in my space rocket. You no need put money in my pocket. The door is closed I just

02:44:25.440 --> 02:44:31.440
I put my co-plug in your socket.

02:44:31.440 --> 02:44:34.440
The sun and sky is bright like fire.

02:44:34.440 --> 02:44:38.440
You and me gets higher and higher.

02:44:38.440 --> 02:44:42.440
A lot of communication bias.

02:44:42.440 --> 02:44:46.440
Only thing can stop us is flat tire.

02:44:49.440 --> 02:44:53.440
Hey love crusader, I want to be your space invader.

02:44:53.440 --> 02:44:56.440
For you I would descend the deepest moon crater

02:44:56.440 --> 02:44:59.440
I is more stronger than Darth Vapour

02:44:59.440 --> 02:45:02.440
Obey me, I is your new dictator

02:45:02.440 --> 02:45:04.440
For you is Venus, I am Mars

02:45:04.440 --> 02:45:07.440
With you I is more richer than all the stars

02:45:07.440 --> 02:45:09.440
Make our wishes on our shooting stars

02:45:09.440 --> 02:45:13.440
Then for you I will play on my cosmic guitar

02:45:13.440 --> 02:45:17.440
Ladies and gentlemen, fasten your belt please

02:45:17.440 --> 02:45:19.440
We has commenced our descent

02:45:19.440 --> 02:45:23.440
I trust you enjoy this flight, as much as you enjoy this accent.

02:45:23.440 --> 02:45:27.440
Now, back on Earth, it's time for a down splash.

02:45:27.440 --> 02:45:31.440
Into sea of eternal glory, my spaceship crash.

02:45:31.440 --> 02:45:34.440
People have arrived for to cheer me from near and far.

02:45:34.440 --> 02:45:37.440
And as I plot, I open door and shout,

02:45:37.440 --> 02:45:43.440
I am way's biggest washed up superstar!

02:45:43.440 --> 02:45:48.440
Electronic, electronic, as for sure as the sun rises in the west.

02:45:48.440 --> 02:45:52.440
Of all the saints and poets on earth, I am the bestest.

02:45:52.440 --> 02:45:55.440
Come, let me put the ring of Jupiter on your finger.

02:45:55.440 --> 02:45:58.440
Then, like a smell around you, I will never linger.

02:45:58.440 --> 02:46:01.440
Okay, it's time for end. No more will I sang.

02:46:01.440 --> 02:46:06.440
Let me take you back in time. I want for you to experience big bang.

02:46:06.440 --> 02:46:15.440
Long live Space Race. Long live Mofania.

02:46:25.440 --> 02:46:29.440
Quite an interesting reaction both here in studio and in the chat room.

02:46:29.440 --> 02:46:33.440
Will it work out in the song's favor or not? Let's see Darcekra.

02:46:33.440 --> 02:46:43.440
I just cracked up when I first heard that, so I give a ten for you.

02:46:43.440 --> 02:46:45.440
Iguana Girls.

02:46:45.440 --> 02:46:50.440
It's got a nice rhythm and you can dance to it. Nice.

02:46:50.440 --> 02:46:54.440
Uh, Islander.

02:46:54.440 --> 02:46:58.440
I thoroughly enjoyed that. What can I say? It's a ten.

02:46:58.440 --> 02:46:59.440
Navi.

02:46:59.440 --> 02:47:05.800
It makes me giggle like when I heard heterosexuality, but I only have lovers it gets a 10 because it has to win

02:47:07.280 --> 02:47:09.280
Arcadia

02:47:16.440 --> 02:47:20.920
Dark Sakura, this is something I would expect from Loki not from you, but

02:47:21.480 --> 02:47:24.280
based on the butt plug in my socket line

02:47:24.280 --> 02:47:31.280
I'm sorry, it would be a better fortune cookie song than it would be a Cage Mintz song.

02:47:31.280 --> 02:47:33.280
Ooh, someone jealous, someone jealous.

02:47:33.280 --> 02:47:37.280

folks out there have some questions, want to speak to some of our guests that are left

02:48:52.320 --> 02:48:56.940
here in studio. I don't know if anyone's going to actually call, but we'll see here. We'll

02:48:56.940 --> 02:48:57.940
go take a...what?

02:48:57.940 --> 02:48:59.560
I'm going to do a sim update.

02:48:59.560 --> 02:49:01.220
Okay, Loki, what's going on in the sim world?

02:49:01.220 --> 02:49:09.680
Okay, there's been updates to both the In the Groove skin, if no one cares, and the

02:49:09.680 --> 02:49:19.720
DDR red skin, which is meh. And also, StepMania, or at least Candid 2 came out. Okay, that's

02:49:19.720 --> 02:49:26.260
it. Nothing important. Nothing is here. Move along.

02:49:26.260 --> 02:49:32.060
Well that was quick. What can I say about that? Let's see. Well I guess what we can

02:49:32.060 --> 02:49:36.700
do right now while I'm tallying cage match votes. Jamie, why don't you go ahead and plug

02:49:36.700 --> 02:49:39.460
some of those other shows that you can hear on our lovely station.

02:49:39.460 --> 02:49:43.900
I'm sure there's people who would like to give it the plug. I mean, oh, I'm sorry. Tuesday

02:49:43.900 --> 02:49:48.140
night is my show, Pump Up the Volume, starts at 7 o'clock this morning.

02:49:48.140 --> 02:49:51.140
I'm going to cut you off real fast because we just got a call on the Skyplane.

02:49:51.140 --> 02:49:52.140
No.

02:49:52.140 --> 02:49:53.140
Too bad!

02:49:53.140 --> 02:49:55.140
We'll finish your plug, then we'll go to the Skyplane.

02:49:55.140 --> 02:49:56.140
Never mind, I'm done.

02:49:56.140 --> 02:49:57.140
Fine.

02:49:57.140 --> 02:49:58.140
Alright.

02:49:58.140 --> 02:49:59.140
Hi!

02:49:59.140 --> 02:50:00.140
You're on Orange Lawn's radio.

02:50:00.140 --> 02:50:01.140
Who's this?

02:50:01.140 --> 02:50:02.140
Hey, what's up?

02:50:02.140 --> 02:50:03.140
It's Sherlock.

02:50:03.140 --> 02:50:04.140
Hi, Sherlock.

02:50:04.140 --> 02:50:05.140
How are you?

02:50:05.140 --> 02:50:06.140
Cat!

02:50:06.140 --> 02:50:07.140
How you doing tonight?

02:50:07.140 --> 02:50:08.140
Cat.

02:50:08.140 --> 02:50:09.140
We are good.

02:50:09.140 --> 02:50:11.140
We're pressed for time, but we're doing pretty well, all things considered.

02:50:11.140 --> 02:50:14.140
What's on your mind, Sherlock?

02:50:14.140 --> 02:50:17.760
I don't like the other two

02:50:17.760 --> 02:50:23.080
all is probably the winner here. Really? Now, see, I have a feeling that they're going to

02:50:23.080 --> 02:50:28.160
go for the funny one. Uh, no, no, I just don't like it. Was it not funny to you, or what

02:50:28.160 --> 02:50:34.040
was up with it? No, I'm annoyed by German techno. It's just that amusing. Aren't we

02:50:34.040 --> 02:50:38.840
all? Wouldn't the world be a better place? The only German songs we should be listening

02:50:38.840 --> 02:50:44.640
to should be by Rammstein. Stay in Germany, alright? Let it stay there. Wasn't Erotic

02:50:44.640 --> 02:50:51.640
from Germany? I think so. Enough said. Exactly! That's probably the only song you've heard

02:50:51.640 --> 02:50:55.520
from... No, because when I first considered Eurodance, the last time I checked, Germany

02:50:55.520 --> 02:51:05.380
wasn't in Europe. Germany's not in Europe? Okay, anyway. Did you have a question for

02:51:05.380 --> 02:51:09.160
any of our guests that are here tonight? We've got Iguana Girl, and hey, you know, you're

02:51:09.160 --> 02:51:14.160
a mod over on The Freak, right? Yeah, I am. Alright, how is it working for Iguana Girl?

02:51:14.160 --> 02:51:16.160
She just carry an iron fist or what?

02:51:17.160 --> 02:51:19.160
Yeah, she keeps an iron fist pretty well.

02:51:19.160 --> 02:51:20.660
She keeps check on me all the time.

02:51:20.660 --> 02:51:22.160
I know she's got an iron bra.

02:51:23.160 --> 02:51:27.160
Hopefully you haven't had to deal with that yet, though.

02:51:27.160 --> 02:51:29.160
I didn't want to know that.

02:51:29.160 --> 02:51:31.160
Was it made in Taiwan?

02:51:31.160 --> 02:51:33.160
No, it was made in Taiwan.

02:51:33.160 --> 02:51:35.160
Here comes Iguana Girl on the keyboard.

02:51:35.160 --> 02:51:36.160
Uh oh.

02:51:36.160 --> 02:51:39.160
I think she's going to post a link to the iron bra.

02:51:39.160 --> 02:51:42.160
If you haven't seen this Sherlock, you've got to check it out. It's amazing.

02:51:42.160 --> 02:51:43.760
oh god

02:51:43.760 --> 02:51:45.720
i don't know if i want to see this

02:51:45.720 --> 02:51:46.880
it's pretty funny

02:51:46.880 --> 02:51:49.660
all right i think we got in all the votes for cage match if you don't mind

02:51:49.660 --> 02:51:52.180
shirok i'm gonna sidetrack for a little bit here

02:51:52.180 --> 02:51:56.380
and i'm going to announce the winner of tonight's cage match you guys ready

02:51:56.380 --> 02:51:58.880
first of all what do you guys think won

02:51:58.880 --> 02:52:01.340
out of all those songs

02:52:01.340 --> 02:52:04.560
you're fucking ruining america god damn you people

02:52:04.560 --> 02:52:10.560
all right let's see here we go tonight's winner is

02:52:10.560 --> 02:52:20.120
With electronic supersonic, sorry Sherlock. The tribe has spoken. With almost, get this,

02:52:20.120 --> 02:52:27.220
get this Sherlock, twice as many votes as songs one and two combined.

02:52:27.220 --> 02:52:33.480
You people smoke crack, I swear. Well, what can we say, I already told you

02:52:33.480 --> 02:52:38.920
we were the bastardist, cancerous sub-community here and that vote speaks for itself.

02:52:38.920 --> 02:52:49.480
yeah yeah it seems like it. Did you get a link to the picture there? Yeah I did. I'd

02:52:49.480 --> 02:52:53.800
rather not look at it again. Let me look, I want to see if it actually works or not.

02:52:53.800 --> 02:52:57.840
If you're in our chat room there over at orangehonestradio.com click on chat. There it is. There's a guana

02:52:57.840 --> 02:53:07.040
girl with the lovely white face and the iron bra. Amazing. That's great. Alright, anything

02:53:07.040 --> 02:53:13.520
Anything else you want to state on your 15 seconds of fame here, Sherlock?

02:53:13.520 --> 02:53:17.280
I'd say something, but then the guanagro probably hate me for it, so I'm just going to...

02:53:17.280 --> 02:53:21.080
Oh, now we definitely want to hear it.

02:53:21.080 --> 02:53:23.520
Let me guess, the internet is serious business, guys?

02:53:23.520 --> 02:53:27.000
Yes, the internet is very serious business.

02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:28.000
That's what I tell everyone.

02:53:28.000 --> 02:53:30.040
Why does that say Sherlock, the guanagro?

02:53:30.040 --> 02:53:33.160
Okay, I'm going to do a nice little shot on the camera right for you.

02:53:33.160 --> 02:53:34.160
Okay, Chris?

02:53:34.160 --> 02:53:35.160
Yeah.

02:53:35.160 --> 02:53:38.640
Oh, she just banked her bottom!

02:53:38.640 --> 02:53:41.800
Oh!

02:53:41.800 --> 02:53:46.640
Wow. It's only when Sherlock calls in do we get the bondage coming out on this show.

02:53:46.640 --> 02:53:50.840
I guess we'll have to call in more often then, alright?

02:53:50.840 --> 02:53:53.880
Are you coming to E3 next year, Sherlock?

02:53:53.880 --> 02:53:57.480
I'm hoping so, yeah. I'll be there.

02:53:57.480 --> 02:54:01.360
Yeah, yeah, she's gonna attack me.

02:54:01.360 --> 02:54:04.720
I talk about Mod of the Month when I'm not supposed to.

02:54:04.720 --> 02:54:06.720
And then she hates me for it.

02:54:34.720 --> 02:54:41.280
All right, well that was fun. I like hearing from new people once in a while, so that's

02:54:41.280 --> 02:54:46.560
good. All right, we've got to, got to, got to get to the FUs of the week. If you already

02:54:46.560 --> 02:54:52.640
sent me your FU of the week, I had to close it on accident because of the cage match voting.

02:54:52.640 --> 02:54:57.080
So you want to get those back into me right now. In the meantime, we're going to limit

02:54:57.080 --> 02:55:04.100
it. Sadly enough, we do have to limit it to one FU a person tonight. So Jamie, why do

02:55:04.100 --> 02:55:07.900
we have to do the FUs of the week every single week even when we have no time whatsoever

02:55:07.900 --> 02:55:08.900
for it.

02:55:08.900 --> 02:55:09.900
Anger.

02:55:09.900 --> 02:55:10.900
All this is bad.

02:55:10.900 --> 02:55:11.900
Here is justice.

02:55:11.900 --> 02:55:12.900
Here is punishment.

02:55:12.900 --> 02:55:13.900
Here is...

02:55:13.900 --> 02:55:14.900
This is fucked up.

02:55:14.900 --> 02:55:33.900
A big, massive, humongous FU to the cost of plane tickets into Gulfport, Mississippi.

02:55:33.900 --> 02:55:40.300
I couldn't find one into Mobile for less than $800, and I couldn't find one into Gulfport

02:55:40.300 --> 02:55:42.980
for less than $500 at the time I needed to leave.

02:55:42.980 --> 02:55:48.260
Yeah, I was on Travelocity trying to pick my time, and I found one into New Orleans,

02:55:48.260 --> 02:55:51.140
so that means that my family's going to have to drive an extra hour and a half to come

02:55:51.140 --> 02:55:56.140
get me, but at least I get to leave New Orleans at five in the afternoon, which means that

02:55:56.140 --> 02:55:58.860
I get to enjoy the French Quarter during the day.

02:55:58.860 --> 02:55:59.860
What?

02:55:59.860 --> 02:56:00.860
But it's ridiculous.

02:56:00.860 --> 02:56:01.860
It's ridiculous!

02:56:01.860 --> 02:56:04.860
That does blood. Totally ridiculous.

02:56:04.860 --> 02:56:09.860
Alright, moving on. Here we go. Uh, Loki.

02:56:10.860 --> 02:56:17.860
Lucky to my car and mainly Ford because they make shoddy cars and my car is falling apart and I don't know why.

02:56:17.860 --> 02:56:27.860
I just bought it like what, six months ago? Used, granted, but it only has like only like 30 some odd, you know, thousand miles on it.

02:56:27.860 --> 02:56:32.860
and already the brake system I think is going out, or the front part is going out, and guess what?

02:56:32.860 --> 02:56:35.860
Oh, they have a class action lawsuit for that kind of stuff!

02:56:35.860 --> 02:56:38.860
Shoddy brakes! Yay! Guess what?

02:56:38.860 --> 02:56:44.860
But lucky for me, I was smart and bought the extended warranty, so it will only cost me $50 to fix.

02:56:44.860 --> 02:56:46.860
Whatever the fuck's wrong.

02:56:46.860 --> 02:56:47.860
So...

02:56:47.860 --> 02:56:48.860
Ha!

02:56:48.860 --> 02:56:51.860
But that's my guess right now.

02:56:51.860 --> 02:56:55.860
Whether or not they fucking try to screw me out of that, that's another story.

02:56:55.860 --> 02:57:02.860
next week

02:57:04.300 --> 02:57:07.300
my a few this week goes out to spread pcs

02:57:07.300 --> 02:57:10.780
because i went over there today to get a brand new cell phone and found out

02:57:10.780 --> 02:57:13.900
they have shipped for deals right now i figured you know i'd be able to get a

02:57:13.900 --> 02:57:15.100
good deal because

02:57:15.100 --> 02:57:18.140
i'm out and not under contract with them right now but other deals are pretty

02:57:18.140 --> 02:57:20.860
shitty in fact the salesman excellent salesman

02:57:20.860 --> 02:57:23.220
told me to come back later because they'll probably be getting better

02:57:23.220 --> 02:57:28.420
deals around Christmas time. Fuck you guys, I swear to God, I'm going over to T-Mobile

02:57:28.420 --> 02:57:32.980
where I can have a cell phone that Catherine Zeta-Jones endorses.

02:57:32.980 --> 02:57:33.980
Iguana Girl?

02:57:33.980 --> 02:57:40.300
I'm going to be generic on this one because it kind of encompasses a couple of different

02:57:40.300 --> 02:57:46.540
sections, but a giant F you to people who can't seem to understand that when you're

02:57:46.540 --> 02:57:53.000
band you're fucking banned you're not supposed to come back and if you do come

02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:59.740
back don't whine and bitch and moan about the fact that you're the man I'm

02:57:59.740 --> 02:58:03.380
gonna give you I'm gonna give you some advice I I realize you know I I realize

02:58:03.380 --> 02:58:05.680
that I don't have to do any banning or anything like that so I'm gonna deal

02:58:05.680 --> 02:58:08.060
with the same bullshit you do but this is how I deal with it here on orange

02:58:08.060 --> 02:58:10.260
lounge okay you just gotta look them right in the eye

02:58:10.260 --> 02:58:12.260
FIRED!

02:58:12.260 --> 02:58:13.260
That's what you gotta do.

02:58:13.260 --> 02:58:19.260
But there are those people out there that are banned from the show, like, years ago, and they still keep-

02:58:19.260 --> 02:58:22.260
Yes, we have banned some people, I forgot.

02:58:22.260 --> 02:58:34.260
But, yeah, I'm really, really tired of people who think that they're being cute, and make threats on certain other websites that they're going to attack certain websites,

02:58:34.260 --> 02:58:38.260
And don't think that we're not going to catch wind fission.

02:58:38.260 --> 02:58:41.260
Giant f-you to those dumb shits.

02:58:41.260 --> 02:58:43.260
I want to close watching you. Be good.

02:58:43.260 --> 02:58:45.260
Islander.

02:58:45.260 --> 02:58:46.260
I have none.

02:58:46.260 --> 02:58:50.260
Nothing? F-you to that, Islander.

02:58:50.260 --> 02:58:52.260
That's alright. No. He's...

02:58:52.260 --> 02:58:54.260
You know, Islander's just a nice guy, honestly.

02:58:54.260 --> 02:58:57.260
If you have a chance to meet him in real life, he's honestly the nicest guy.

02:58:57.260 --> 02:58:59.260
A wonderful contrast to me.

02:58:59.260 --> 02:59:03.740
And I do know why we work.

02:59:03.740 --> 02:59:04.740
I see.

02:59:04.740 --> 02:59:05.740
Okay.

02:59:05.740 --> 02:59:06.740
Makes sense.

02:59:06.740 --> 02:59:07.740
Uh, Navi?

02:59:07.740 --> 02:59:08.740
I actually have an F.U.

02:59:08.740 --> 02:59:09.740
Whoo!

02:59:09.740 --> 02:59:10.740
Alright, what is it?

02:59:10.740 --> 02:59:13.420
Um, F.U. to people who stop talking to you for like three months, call you back because

02:59:13.420 --> 02:59:17.940
they miss you, make plans, and then flake out on you, and disappear again!

02:59:17.940 --> 02:59:18.940
Yeah.

02:59:18.940 --> 02:59:19.940
Wonderful world.

02:59:19.940 --> 02:59:25.220
Oh yes, and then her, in reference to her band thing, I got banned.

02:59:25.220 --> 02:59:26.520
I don't know how.

02:59:26.520 --> 02:59:34.300
I had a link to some sim files or something. I checked back on it periodically. It kept

02:59:34.300 --> 02:59:39.440
showing up, you know, you can't load the page. Then the other day, it says, you are banned!

02:59:39.440 --> 02:59:46.280
From what? Freak or where? No, it was some guy who posted his key-sounded 2DX BMS files,

02:59:46.280 --> 02:59:50.960
and it was in his signature. I got some of those a long time ago, and he only allowed

02:59:50.960 --> 02:59:54.120
two people on there at once. I remembered that. I checked again like the other night,

02:59:54.120 --> 03:00:05.560
it says I'm banned. I'm off. That's odd. That's that. Arcadian. Fuck you to lies. Ooh, ouch.

03:00:05.560 --> 03:00:12.040
All right. Let's check out what the chat room has to say. Start off with Zaku. F you. Oh

03:00:12.040 --> 03:00:17.040
boy, here we go. It's political. Brace yourselves. F you to the Jesus-loving, gun-loving, red

03:00:17.040 --> 03:00:20.840
state voters for electing that no good excuse of a chimp of a President George W. Bush to

03:00:20.840 --> 03:00:26.720
second term in the words of a great pump it up song lasenka save us that was

03:00:26.720 --> 03:00:34.480
awfully punny right Chan but to you to being one of the many that sick oh I

03:00:34.480 --> 03:00:38.720
think I think she's saying fuck you to herself for being sick I'm not sure and

03:00:38.720 --> 03:00:45.640
it's that somehow I jazz says f you to procrastination ah

03:00:45.640 --> 03:00:55.400
Poto says F you to laggy towns in MMOs MPQ says F you to the arcade for being

03:00:55.400 --> 03:01:01.920
closed the day I went there black devil or X says F you to those Asian files on

03:01:01.920 --> 03:01:10.040
the DDR freak forums those guys pissed me off well any comment on that and one

03:01:10.040 --> 03:01:15.040
I'm sorry I cannot control the content of the idiot's pose. Sorry.

03:01:15.040 --> 03:01:17.040
I figured while you're here I would let you say something.

03:01:17.040 --> 03:01:18.040
Oh my god.

03:01:18.040 --> 03:01:19.040
Alright.

03:01:19.040 --> 03:01:20.040
L. Mullet says,

03:01:20.040 --> 03:01:26.040
F you to Halo 2 and a type the game will never live up to.

03:01:26.040 --> 03:01:30.040
Blue using Halo 2, that's all that matters.

03:01:30.040 --> 03:01:31.040
And lastly,

03:01:31.040 --> 03:01:32.040
DDR Angel says,

03:01:32.040 --> 03:01:36.040
F you to my video card for suddenly not liking Final Fantasy XI again.

03:01:36.040 --> 03:01:37.040
I wondered why I hadn't seen her on.

03:01:37.040 --> 03:01:39.040
Grr, no Final Fantasy XI for me.

03:01:39.040 --> 03:01:44.400
for me birthday present maybe yeah I'll keep wishing okay done bye and Jamie

03:01:44.400 --> 03:01:47.360

03:01:59.680 --> 03:02:03.200

pop music and DDR yeah and you just you know sometime you'll just all the other

DVD and V-Rares and all that stuff to find out how great they actually are.

03:02:14.480 --> 03:02:17.180
You know what, November's just a busy month and we'll have to carry over some stuff to

03:02:17.180 --> 03:02:19.920
next week. You know you're welcome back here any time, all you guys are.

03:02:19.920 --> 03:02:23.640
Yeah, as long as I'm willing to drive here. Yeah, it is a little ways, I agree. It's kind

03:02:23.640 --> 03:02:28.040
of crazy, but thank you, of course, for coming as always. And thank you guys for going to

03:02:28.040 --> 03:02:33.080
Girl and Islander. Hope you had a good time. Come back sometime. And, you know, good luck

03:03:03.080 --> 03:03:08.080
Alright, um, now's the part of the show where we go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

03:03:08.080 --> 03:03:10.080
Just like Jerry Springer, we go around and get all the final thoughts.

03:03:10.080 --> 03:03:12.080
Navi, your final thought for tonight?

03:03:12.080 --> 03:03:14.080
I've run out of walls.

03:03:14.080 --> 03:03:18.080
Uh, Aquana Girl, your final thought for tonight?

03:03:18.080 --> 03:03:20.080
Butt plugs in socket.

03:03:20.080 --> 03:03:24.080
Islander, your final thought for tonight?

03:03:24.080 --> 03:03:26.080
Eat, drink, and be merry.

03:03:26.080 --> 03:03:29.080
Very nice. Arcadian, your final thought for tonight?

03:03:29.080 --> 03:03:31.080
Say I'm bad.

03:03:31.080 --> 03:03:36.080
You see, I'm bad. You don't know the half of it! Ha ha ha! Or maybe not.

03:03:36.080 --> 03:03:38.080
No, can't have that.

03:03:38.080 --> 03:03:40.080
Loki, your final thought?

03:03:40.080 --> 03:03:45.080
I have the device done, now to haunt the house.

03:03:45.080 --> 03:03:48.080
Jamie, quick! Jamie, quick! Your final thought?

03:03:48.080 --> 03:03:54.080

03:03:54.080 --> 03:03:57.080
Fuck Survivor and fuck The Apprentice!

Please do something about that nice food, don't forget.

03:03:59.080 --> 03:04:03.640
I will. I know, I know, for once I'm saying fuck survivor, it's funny, but anyway, you

just, you gotta listen, so, sorry. Uh, DarkSacker, your final thought?

03:04:58.000 --> 03:05:03.000
C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C

03:05:28.000 --> 03:05:30.500
It was December 24th when Hollis Evans had docked

03:05:30.500 --> 03:05:33.000
When I see the man chillin' with his dog at the park

03:05:33.000 --> 03:05:35.500
I'd approach him very slowly with my heart full of fear

03:05:35.500 --> 03:05:38.500
Looked at his dog, oh my God, it all rained there

03:05:38.500 --> 03:05:40.500
But then I was feelin' cool, the man had a beard

03:05:40.500 --> 03:05:43.000
Had a bag full of city 12 o'clock at night

03:05:43.000 --> 03:05:45.500
So I turned my head a second and the man was gone

03:05:45.500 --> 03:05:48.500
But he must've strapped his wildin' back down on the lawn

03:05:48.500 --> 03:05:50.500
I picked the wallet up and then I took a pause

03:05:50.500 --> 03:05:53.500
Took out the license and it costed Santa Claus

03:05:53.500 --> 03:05:56.000
A million dollars in the cold, hundreds of G's

03:05:56.000 --> 03:05:58.400
enough to buy a Bowie Magic Claw and eat

03:05:58.400 --> 03:06:00.800
But I never filled the Santa, so that ain't right

03:06:00.800 --> 03:06:03.200
So I was going home to matter back to him that night

03:06:03.200 --> 03:06:04.800
But when I got home, I thought,

03:06:04.800 --> 03:06:07.200
Cuz under the tree was a letter from Santa

03:06:07.200 --> 03:06:08.800
And the door was to me

03:06:18.400 --> 03:06:21.200
It's Christmas time in Hollis, Queens

03:06:21.200 --> 03:06:23.600
Mom's cooking chicken in collard greens

03:06:23.600 --> 03:06:26.100
Rice and stuff and macaroni and cheese

03:06:26.100 --> 03:06:28.600
And Santa put gifts under Christmas trees

03:06:28.600 --> 03:06:31.100
Decorate the house with lights at night

03:06:31.100 --> 03:06:33.600
Snow's on the ground, Snow White's so bright

03:06:33.600 --> 03:06:36.100
In the fireplace is the Yule log

03:06:36.100 --> 03:06:38.600
Beneath the mistletoe, every drink eggnog

03:06:38.600 --> 03:06:41.100
The rhymes that you hear are the rhymes of Jarrell

03:06:41.100 --> 03:06:45.100
But each and every year we bust Christmas Carols

03:06:59.100 --> 03:07:02.100
Rhyme so loud and proud to hear it's Christmas time

03:07:02.100 --> 03:07:05.100
That we've got the spirit, jacks for chili

03:07:05.100 --> 03:07:09.100
The Hawk is out, and that's what Christmas is all about

03:07:09.100 --> 03:07:14.100
The time is now, the place is here And the whole wide world is filled with cheer

03:07:14.100 --> 03:07:19.100
My name is MC with the mic in my hand And I'm chillin' and coolin' just like a snowman

03:07:19.100 --> 03:07:25.100
So open your eyes, lend us a ear We wanna say Merry Christmas and Happy New Year

03:07:49.100 --> 03:08:16.940
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

03:08:16.940 --> 03:08:21.100
Orange Lounge Radio Afterbirth, the part after we fade to black. Hopefully you guys know

03:08:21.100 --> 03:08:25.340
to stick around because there's always something fun after the credits. Tonight, my God, we

03:08:25.340 --> 03:08:29.560
are so pooped though. I mean, it's just been a hell of a show. What a way to come back

03:08:29.560 --> 03:08:35.440
after not being here. I do, I need to talk about ratings though. I need to talk about

03:08:35.440 --> 03:08:42.940
ratings for the station. Ratings, what? Ratings for the station have fallen 20% in the past

03:08:42.940 --> 03:08:45.260
two weeks

03:08:45.260 --> 03:08:47.860
I am quite disappointed in you guys, that's alright

03:08:47.860 --> 03:08:49.060
but here's your chance

03:08:49.060 --> 03:08:50.940
go in your little player window right now

03:08:50.940 --> 03:08:54.080
vote us a five that you love this station, you want to listen to it every day

03:08:54.080 --> 03:08:54.980
and then do so

03:08:54.980 --> 03:08:58.820
and help our ratings get back up. Now we realize, okay, we were off for a week, we

03:08:58.820 --> 03:09:00.760
had some repeats in there

03:09:00.760 --> 03:09:03.100
and you know we, you know, had

03:09:03.100 --> 03:09:04.780
had some shows, switch days and stuff

03:09:04.780 --> 03:09:06.340
no more excuses, we're done

03:09:06.340 --> 03:09:09.920
okay so you gotta whore us up so that you know we can be the number one internet

03:09:09.920 --> 03:09:31.360
radio station of all time. That is the ultimate goal.

03:09:31.360 --> 03:09:36.960
Anyway, I also want to talk quickly about The Incredibles, that movie, because I'm surprised

03:09:36.960 --> 03:09:41.840
you didn't say much about it, Loki. What did you think of the movie?

03:09:41.840 --> 03:09:48.240
It is what all superhero movies should aspire to. It's actually, it's very misleading, like

03:09:48.240 --> 03:09:52.640
anyone that's like, you know, seen the previous, because they think, oh, it's a kid's movie,

03:09:52.640 --> 03:09:57.800
oh, this and that, but actually it has a story that I would say is on par if not better than

03:09:57.800 --> 03:10:00.600
a lot of the animated superman and

03:10:00.600 --> 03:10:03.500
uh... batman series and we know that those are awesome

03:10:03.500 --> 03:10:05.520
uh... writers on the series

03:10:05.520 --> 03:10:08.960
of course you mean the guys that coming wrote the whole damn thing you know the

03:10:08.960 --> 03:10:11.800
guy behind you know what in uh...

03:10:11.800 --> 03:10:14.760
the iron giant i mean that would be was incredible

03:10:14.760 --> 03:10:16.960
this movie is

03:10:16.960 --> 03:10:19.140
set design uh...

03:10:19.140 --> 03:10:20.720
the character development

03:10:20.720 --> 03:10:22.660
everything is just

03:10:22.660 --> 03:10:24.400
you need to see this movie

03:10:24.400 --> 03:10:26.640
and i cannot stress enough is

03:10:26.640 --> 03:10:29.780
awesome i cannot wait for a sequel

03:10:29.780 --> 03:10:32.480
this is like pixar at a whole new level

03:10:32.480 --> 03:10:34.900
and what's great though is it is for kids

03:10:34.900 --> 03:10:36.620
but it is a little bit more adult

03:10:36.620 --> 03:10:41.480
than some of the other kids movies. It's PG, there is like violence in it

03:10:41.480 --> 03:10:42.700
and stuff

03:10:42.700 --> 03:10:44.200
and there's like you know

03:10:44.200 --> 03:10:51.200
it's just great. The characters were awesome. That's all I have to say. I mean, it was just incredible.

03:10:52.100 --> 03:10:55.400
You know, I thought the movie was fun. It was really entertaining. I don't know about like

03:10:55.400 --> 03:10:58.420
the best movie of all time and stuff like that. I don't know if it was even the best

03:10:58.420 --> 03:11:01.960
movie of the year for me personally, but it was a really fun time, and if I had kids I'd

03:11:01.960 --> 03:11:05.120
take them to see it because I thought it was a good movie, and just really well animated.

03:11:05.120 --> 03:11:08.440
I was sitting there during the whole time going, this would make a really cute video

03:11:08.440 --> 03:11:11.680
game, and in fact they do have a video game for it, and I was actually kind of curious

03:11:11.680 --> 03:11:15.080
to check it out. I kind of think, oh, it might be a fun video game. We'll see. Did you see

03:11:15.080 --> 03:11:20.440
this movie yet, Navi, at all? I have not. The last movie I saw was The Grudge. What

03:11:20.440 --> 03:11:24.480
did you think of that? I liked it a lot. A lot of people that have seen it either said

03:11:24.480 --> 03:11:27.120
they liked it and thought it was really scary, and then other people said that movie had

03:11:27.120 --> 03:11:32.080
absolutely no substance whatsoever, it was crap. I liked it, I thought it, I mean, it

03:11:32.080 --> 03:11:36.820
was more something like, wow, it was actually a scary movie. We don't see very many scary

03:11:36.820 --> 03:11:39.560
movies very often anymore, at least that's what I thought.

03:11:39.560 --> 03:11:44.200
Yeah, for the record, I did not get to see the Star Wars 3 trailer when I saw The Incredibles,

03:11:44.200 --> 03:11:47.680
just for whoever asked. I don't really care, I'm not like the hugest Star Wars fan in the

03:11:47.680 --> 03:11:53.380
world, I mean, you know, hooray, the movie's coming out, but, you know, I'll be okay. Anyway,

03:11:53.380 --> 03:11:56.300
I like the grudge as well, except for the audience I saw it with.

03:11:56.300 --> 03:11:58.300
Yeah, you should have been in the moment.

03:11:58.300 --> 03:12:00.300
You should, like, compare audiences later.

03:12:00.300 --> 03:12:01.300
Seriously.

03:12:01.300 --> 03:12:02.300
Alright.

03:12:02.300 --> 03:12:04.980
Well, okay, that's going to do it for the Afterbirth, you guys.

03:12:04.980 --> 03:12:05.980
We've got to take off.

03:12:05.980 --> 03:12:10.820
Jamie's got to get home, and I got tests to grade and stuff like that, so thank you guys

03:12:10.820 --> 03:12:12.180
for listening, though, so much.

03:12:12.180 --> 03:12:15.460
We really do appreciate the fact that you guys support this station through our high

03:12:15.460 --> 03:12:17.020
points and our low points.

03:12:17.020 --> 03:12:19.580
We are working on so many exciting things for you guys.

03:12:19.580 --> 03:12:21.340
We're teaming up with Spot.

03:12:21.340 --> 03:12:23.220
We're teaming up with Freak.

03:12:23.220 --> 03:12:28.520
amazing, the stuff that's in the future for us. And, you know, I just, I really thank

03:12:28.520 --> 03:12:31.480
you guys who have supported us, especially those from day one, but we definitely welcome

03:12:31.480 --> 03:12:37.960
all you guys to hop on board as the show goes on. It's just amazing. It's amazing. I don't

03:12:37.960 --> 03:12:42.240
think it's on, Jane. Remember, do it for the ferrets. They love you too. Let's hear a little

03:12:42.240 --> 03:12:49.240
ferret love there. Get a little ferret love. Even, you know what, Loki, we don't get enough,

03:12:49.240 --> 03:12:54.280
we don't get enough love out of Loki on this show. Loki, will you please let the listeners

03:12:54.280 --> 03:13:04.000
know how much you love them? Uh, no. Ass. Alright, enjoy the post-show tonight. You

03:13:04.000 --> 03:13:06.600
guys can probably figure this one out. We definitely have to load you down with some

03:13:06.600 --> 03:13:13.360
2DX Red music. So, enjoy, have a great night, and we'll see you tomorrow night for Diversion

03:13:13.360 --> 03:13:20.360
7 o'clock for Mani remixes. Have a great night guys!

03:13:43.360 --> 03:13:47.360
In the frame, leggin' through the guards away from me

03:13:47.360 --> 03:13:50.360
That's my young life, it's on the road

03:13:50.360 --> 03:13:54.360
Everybody's lookin', who wants to sing for me?

03:13:54.360 --> 03:13:57.360
Runnin' up the stairs with my gun

03:13:57.360 --> 03:14:00.360
Tomorrow is the last chance for everyone to sing

03:14:00.360 --> 03:14:02.360
I'm not done yet

03:14:02.360 --> 03:14:05.360
Real life's done, I'm done, I'm done, I'm done

03:14:05.360 --> 03:14:08.360
Let's set the tone, we can set the scene

03:14:08.360 --> 03:14:10.360
Make it loud baby, hit the lights and fire

03:14:10.360 --> 03:14:12.360
Turn on the lights on fire

03:14:12.360 --> 03:14:15.000
With your mind, I will see the highlight

03:14:15.000 --> 03:14:43.240
So listen, shall we tell the enhanced soldiers, do you know how to carry it?

03:14:43.240 --> 03:14:46.160
And I think I'll be the one that's beating you

03:14:46.160 --> 03:14:47.900
And you can't just light the fire

03:14:47.900 --> 03:14:49.540
We're on the line for fire

03:14:49.540 --> 03:14:52.280
We're your fire, and we're beating higher

03:14:52.280 --> 03:14:55.540
And I think that you're just the one that's beating you

03:16:55.540 --> 03:16:57.540
you

03:17:25.540 --> 03:17:32.540
Be quiet.

03:17:32.540 --> 03:17:39.540
Be quiet.

03:17:39.540 --> 03:17:46.540
Be quiet.

03:17:46.540 --> 03:17:53.540
Be quiet.

03:17:53.540 --> 03:17:55.540
Be quiet

03:17:55.540 --> 03:18:02.540
Be quiet, be quiet, be quiet, be quiet

Back, back, bring it back.

03:26:22.560 --> 03:26:24.260

Yeah

03:28:01.420 --> 03:28:02.420
Hey!

Hey!

Hey!

03:28:05.420 --> 03:28:06.420
Hey!

03:30:06.420 --> 03:30:07.420
Hey!

03:30:07.420 --> 03:30:08.420
Hey!

03:30:08.420 --> 03:30:09.420
Hey!

03:30:09.420 --> 03:30:10.420
Hey!

03:30:10.420 --> 03:30:11.420

03:30:45.420 --> 03:30:47.420
Hey!

03:32:47.420 --> 03:32:55.420
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio. We're live here with this post-show going on of 2DX11 style, also known as 2DX Red music.

03:32:55.420 --> 03:33:03.420
I guess it's taboo to call it 2DX11 style. I'm not supposed to say that. I might get bitch-slapped by some rabid fan.

03:33:03.420 --> 03:33:09.420
But actually, what I'm going to do right now is I'm actually going to do something technical on this end that has to do with the archive of the broadcast.

03:33:09.420 --> 03:33:13.420
The past few weeks we've been having trouble with it, though, and it stopped the station.

03:33:13.420 --> 03:33:18.420
So if you guys get booted from the stream, it's gonna go back to the Bomani music and more program. So just

03:33:18.940 --> 03:33:25.200
Just just restart the stream in like 15 seconds if we disconnect. Okay, I'm gonna try now

03:33:25.200 --> 03:33:28.080
I'm gonna hope we don't though so I can keep going with the 2dx red stuff. Here we go

03:33:28.080 --> 03:33:31.520
Let's see what happens if I lose you guys then good night. Sorry
