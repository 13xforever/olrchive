[SPEAKER_03]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio episode number 120 in progress and our friends over at Step Squad

10:02.179 --> 10:03.540
[SPEAKER_03]: Sending us that little shout out there.

10:03.560 --> 10:05.182
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay, Step Squad!

10:05.202 --> 10:06.743
[SPEAKER_03]: That shout out's about two years old.

10:06.783 --> 10:07.564
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to get a new one.

10:07.644 --> 10:10.326
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to get a new Step Squad family gathering.

10:10.946 --> 10:12.748
[SPEAKER_03]: And what is Step Squad for those not in the know?

10:12.768 --> 10:14.549
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I know you're a member of Step Squad.

10:14.710 --> 10:21.936
[SPEAKER_08]: Step Squad, it actually isn't really technically a DDR team per se, but it is at the same time.

10:22.316 --> 10:28.681
[SPEAKER_08]: It's more of a friends that were brought together by things like the Mani and Anime.

10:28.741 --> 10:30.323
[SPEAKER_08]: It just has a very DDR tone.

10:30.803 --> 10:34.645
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not one of those, like, teams, oh my god, it's LOL, gonna kick your butt, let's have a battle.

10:34.665 --> 10:47.530
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah, no, it's not all about, oh my god, we have to win over you, no, it's, you know, of course we take pride in our wins, but it's not all DDR to us, it's more about family than anything.

10:47.850 --> 10:48.711
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool, very cool.

10:49.011 --> 10:52.513
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, welcome everybody to Orange Lounge Radio for those joining us for the very first time.

10:52.553 --> 10:53.454
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the program.

10:54.034 --> 10:59.458
[SPEAKER_03]: We are a program dedicated to all things Bomani and then some for those of you that don't know what Bomani is.

10:59.538 --> 11:02.680
[SPEAKER_03]: That is the music gaming fusion series put out by Konami.

11:03.001 --> 11:08.184
[SPEAKER_03]: So, of course, we talk a lot about other types of video games and other types of music and any randomness that we feel like.

11:08.284 --> 11:15.669
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know we got some new folks listening tonight, especially with the syndications happening over on DDR Freak Radio, which Iguana Girl's been helping out with on Friday nights.

11:15.869 --> 11:16.270
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

11:16.750 --> 11:17.531
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate that.

11:17.951 --> 11:19.813
[SPEAKER_03]: 6 o'clock over on DDR Freak Radio on Friday nights.

11:20.154 --> 11:21.555
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know we're getting some new people from that.

11:21.635 --> 11:25.059
[SPEAKER_03]: So thanks a lot, you guys, for tuning in and helping to support Orange Lounge Radio.

11:25.139 --> 11:26.060
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hope you enjoy the program.

11:26.661 --> 11:27.962
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we're a little weird sometimes.

11:28.402 --> 11:28.703
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello?

11:28.943 --> 11:29.644
[SPEAKER_03]: A little weird.

11:30.224 --> 11:30.485
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

11:31.121 --> 11:32.161
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

11:56.528 --> 11:57.429
[SPEAKER_03]: I am the Jamie.

11:57.889 --> 11:59.690
[SPEAKER_03]: Does she know that you're sitting in her chair?

11:59.810 --> 12:00.531
[SPEAKER_08]: No, not at all.

12:01.151 --> 12:03.913
[SPEAKER_03]: And burping out... And burping in her honor.

12:04.918 --> 12:06.399
[SPEAKER_03]: Aguana Girl, how was your week?

12:29.411 --> 12:34.255
[SPEAKER_08]: No, mine, I still haven't taken it in, because I thought I figured out what the problem was.

12:56.779 --> 12:58.060
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what it is.

12:58.160 --> 13:02.923
[SPEAKER_04]: Whenever I coast, it makes a very loud growling noise.

13:03.003 --> 13:05.724
[SPEAKER_04]: Like my car is angry that I'm driving it or something.

13:05.904 --> 13:15.490
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, mine started whenever... It's like if I'm going low speeds, anything like 20 miles per hour or below, and then I proceed to brake, it's starting to squeal.

13:15.750 --> 13:17.271
[SPEAKER_08]: But if it's raining, it won't squeal.

13:18.551 --> 13:20.352
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't know what the hell is wrong with mine.

13:20.392 --> 13:22.053
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm thinking about taking it in, but...

13:23.268 --> 13:23.969
[SPEAKER_08]: Ford Fix or Repair Daily

13:53.208 --> 13:54.048
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but they're cheap.

13:54.589 --> 13:55.889
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's the whole concept.

13:56.649 --> 14:00.111
[SPEAKER_08]: You buy a cheap car, you get a shoddy car, but it'll last a few years.

14:00.571 --> 14:01.911
[SPEAKER_03]: And you've made this comparison before.

14:01.931 --> 14:05.293
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like talking about the Mad Catz dance pads for DDR.

14:05.313 --> 14:09.114
[SPEAKER_03]: The $20 dance pads versus the $100 Ignition 2.0.

14:09.694 --> 14:10.054
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

14:10.595 --> 14:14.216
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're going to pay for an Ignition 2.0, you're going to get the quality of that.

14:14.256 --> 14:16.777
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to last a long time, but you're going to pay out the ass for it.

14:17.634 --> 14:23.716
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you're going to pay for the Mad Catz pad, you have to understand there's going to be some problems with it eventually.

14:24.156 --> 14:28.678
[SPEAKER_04]: Had Speedy Oil Change not killed my car, I wouldn't have this problem now, would I?

14:28.698 --> 14:34.700
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so that's kind of frustrating, and that's how I spent my day, was being frustrating.

14:35.061 --> 14:35.721
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's not fun.

14:36.501 --> 14:38.322
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, take out your frustrations on our listeners.

14:38.802 --> 14:40.583
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

14:40.783 --> 14:41.603
[SPEAKER_14]: Damn you all.

14:41.803 --> 14:43.164
[SPEAKER_14]: Damn you all to hell.

14:45.959 --> 14:46.319
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

14:46.439 --> 14:47.940
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else you want to share about your week?

14:49.080 --> 14:49.220
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

14:49.680 --> 14:49.881
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

14:50.141 --> 14:50.841
[SPEAKER_03]: How was Thanksgiving?

14:51.941 --> 14:53.582
[SPEAKER_08]: I talked about that, but you weren't listening.

14:54.002 --> 14:55.343
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I... Okay, never mind.

14:55.363 --> 14:56.763
[SPEAKER_08]: I said I had to do the two-family thing.

14:56.783 --> 14:58.964
[SPEAKER_08]: We went to Ross's family's house, and then we went to my family's house.

14:58.984 --> 15:01.725
[SPEAKER_03]: I was looking for... I was prying to get that other story you were telling me.

15:02.125 --> 15:02.845
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay.

15:02.925 --> 15:03.626
[SPEAKER_03]: See?

15:03.666 --> 15:05.306
[SPEAKER_03]: I was doing that prying thing.

15:05.346 --> 15:06.547
[SPEAKER_08]: Prying, okay.

15:06.587 --> 15:11.189
[SPEAKER_03]: That hosts do when they know that there's a topic that needs to be talked about, but they don't want to say that there's one.

15:11.289 --> 15:11.889
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so...

15:13.001 --> 15:19.346
[SPEAKER_08]: What we did is we decided to bring all of our odd music games with us.

15:19.386 --> 15:26.812
[SPEAKER_08]: So we brought our Taiko Drum Master and Donkey Konga and Karaoke Revolution 1, 2, and 3.

15:27.692 --> 15:30.334
[SPEAKER_08]: And we took them all over to my parents' house.

15:31.515 --> 15:37.880
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm guessing my mom had a little bit too much wine to drink because she was just having way too much fun on everything.

15:38.981 --> 15:40.462
[SPEAKER_08]: And my mom...

15:41.352 --> 15:43.213
[SPEAKER_08]: I noticed it runs in the family couldn't resist

15:59.998 --> 16:08.760
[SPEAKER_08]: So she tried to play Taiko Drum Master and she got like a 58% on some one-star easy song and just absolutely biffed it.

16:08.780 --> 16:11.661
[SPEAKER_08]: So my brother-in-law, who's a drummer, had to show her up.

16:12.821 --> 16:23.904
[SPEAKER_08]: And then after he did that, my blind father took over the drum, asked us to put it on a song, and proceeded to outplay my mother.

16:25.492 --> 16:26.012
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

16:43.239 --> 16:49.341
[SPEAKER_08]: And at one point he stopped randomly, but we got him to start back up again.

16:49.381 --> 16:57.564
[SPEAKER_08]: And if he hadn't stopped and gotten off of his little groove that he was in, he probably would have passed the song, which is extremely scary.

16:58.744 --> 16:59.725
[SPEAKER_08]: But he ended up getting like a 48%.

17:00.885 --> 17:03.166
[SPEAKER_08]: He didn't beat my mom, but came within 10%.

17:03.626 --> 17:06.887
[SPEAKER_08]: So I can now say that my blind father can play Taiko Drum Master.

17:07.347 --> 17:07.687
[SPEAKER_03]: Very nice.

17:07.868 --> 17:10.330
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think this was a topic once in DDR Chit Chat.

17:10.670 --> 17:12.132
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you play DDR when you're blind?

17:12.772 --> 17:13.253
You don't!

17:14.634 --> 17:16.055
[SPEAKER_08]: You just kind of stomp on all the arrows.

17:16.175 --> 17:20.039
[SPEAKER_03]: You just kind of dance in the rhythm, and you'd be surprised at what you can do.

17:20.059 --> 17:23.262
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually haven't ever had my dad play DDR, but maybe I should.

17:24.443 --> 17:25.124
[SPEAKER_08]: That might be funny.

17:26.705 --> 17:27.166
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

17:27.786 --> 17:29.668
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm thinking he would be good with Donkey Kong, too.

17:30.269 --> 17:30.769
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, very cool.

17:30.809 --> 17:31.130
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

17:31.170 --> 17:31.490
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.

17:32.331 --> 17:32.651
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

17:33.683 --> 17:34.143
[SPEAKER_08]: That's about it.

17:34.263 --> 17:35.184
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we're going to move on.

17:35.224 --> 17:36.244
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk to DDR Angel.

17:36.284 --> 17:36.645
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your week?

17:36.665 --> 17:37.065
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your day?

17:37.285 --> 17:38.906
[SPEAKER_09]: How does a blind person play DDR?

17:38.986 --> 17:40.667
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh boy, what did I just walk into?

17:41.707 --> 17:44.409
[SPEAKER_03]: Same crap you've been walking into for the past, what, year and a half?

17:44.609 --> 17:45.189
[SPEAKER_09]: Almost two.

17:45.269 --> 17:46.150
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.

17:47.971 --> 17:48.811
[SPEAKER_09]: Not much going on.

17:48.851 --> 18:02.479
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, had two days of school this week, and that was pretty good because I really needed the break, just like I'm sure Jess did and all that.

18:03.992 --> 18:14.898
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, after school was over, just, you know, spent the last four days playing games that I haven't been able to play, and I got my DS!

18:15.579 --> 18:16.880
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay!

18:18.921 --> 18:27.966
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um, yeah, that took six stores to find, and it was not good until I walked away with it, and it was all good, so...

18:29.093 --> 18:32.154
[SPEAKER_09]: Best Buy is not your friend unless you call all the stores in Sacramento.

18:32.254 --> 18:32.534
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway!

18:33.215 --> 18:34.995
[SPEAKER_03]: I got my DS at Best Buy, what's your problem?

18:36.116 --> 18:37.496
[SPEAKER_09]: I had to call six stores.

18:37.756 --> 18:38.657
[SPEAKER_09]: That was not cool.

18:40.237 --> 18:41.698
[SPEAKER_09]: Or however many stores you've got, four?

18:43.479 --> 18:45.099
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so I got my DS and it's all good.

18:45.540 --> 18:49.001
[SPEAKER_09]: And the minigames on Mario 64 are your friend.

18:50.441 --> 18:52.462
[SPEAKER_03]: Minigames on Mario 64 DS rock.

18:52.622 --> 18:54.183
[SPEAKER_03]: They make that game worth it, they really do.

18:55.305 --> 18:59.268
[SPEAKER_09]: You can just spend all your time playing the minigames rather than playing the actual game.

19:00.189 --> 19:01.550
[SPEAKER_03]: Favorite minigame so far?

19:01.890 --> 19:03.351
[SPEAKER_09]: The Bob-omb Slingshot game.

19:04.092 --> 19:04.632
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that one.

19:04.652 --> 19:09.176
[SPEAKER_03]: My other favorite one is the He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not, or They Love Me.

19:09.276 --> 19:10.437
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gender neutral, isn't it?

19:10.477 --> 19:12.678
[SPEAKER_03]: Loves Me, Loves Me Not, that's it.

19:13.419 --> 19:14.079
[SPEAKER_09]: Koyoshi.

19:15.961 --> 19:17.522
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so lame, yet so fun.

19:18.863 --> 19:21.625
[SPEAKER_09]: We should get back on that Blind DDR topic later.

19:21.645 --> 19:23.327
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a reason for that.

19:24.007 --> 19:24.828
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, maybe we will.

19:25.436 --> 19:25.756
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay!

19:26.097 --> 19:26.537
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright!

19:26.597 --> 19:26.897
[SPEAKER_09]: Cool!

19:26.978 --> 19:27.338
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright!

19:27.398 --> 19:27.738
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah!

19:28.018 --> 19:28.999
[SPEAKER_03]: Islander, how was your week?

19:29.019 --> 19:29.560
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your day?

19:30.361 --> 19:31.181
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I was fine.

19:31.201 --> 19:34.164
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, pretty much Jessica's already summed it up.

19:34.184 --> 19:38.488
[SPEAKER_06]: For those of you who don't know, that Iwona Girl and I are a couple.

19:38.748 --> 19:39.109
[SPEAKER_06]: Duh.

19:40.070 --> 19:41.331
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, it's a DDR couple.

19:42.412 --> 19:42.852
[SPEAKER_08]: We are?

19:42.872 --> 19:49.178
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought you were just, like, sleeping in my bed for no fair reason.

19:49.398 --> 19:49.498
Oh.

19:52.379 --> 19:53.680
[SPEAKER_20]: This is a TMI alert.

19:57.343 --> 19:58.824
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought you were just my sex slave.

19:58.864 --> 19:59.404
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

20:00.265 --> 20:01.566
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, hey, hey.

20:03.367 --> 20:04.688
[SPEAKER_03]: The TMI SWAT team's here.

20:06.369 --> 20:21.500
[SPEAKER_06]: But no, just spent the days off playing games that we bought because we kind of went crazy and bought a shitload of games including Taiko, Donkey Konga,

20:22.818 --> 20:24.179
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh shit, KR3.

20:25.980 --> 20:28.002
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys went on quite a little spending spree, didn't you?

20:28.242 --> 20:28.982
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

20:29.022 --> 20:30.183
[SPEAKER_08]: We went a little crazy.

20:31.123 --> 20:32.184
[SPEAKER_08]: But we've been good.

20:32.604 --> 20:34.626
[SPEAKER_06]: A little crazy, Rumble Roses.

20:35.546 --> 20:37.547
[SPEAKER_08]: We've lost almost 80 pounds, we earned it.

20:39.248 --> 20:44.972
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, just when I'm playing all these games that I'm like, holy crap, I have like new stuff to play now.

20:46.513 --> 20:48.074
[SPEAKER_06]: So, just been doing a lot of that lately.

20:48.234 --> 20:49.755
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.

20:50.415 --> 20:51.396
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else you want to share about your

20:52.044 --> 20:53.465
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, let's see.

20:54.386 --> 20:57.668
[SPEAKER_06]: Other than watching her blind father play Tycho.

21:00.930 --> 21:03.732
[SPEAKER_06]: Trying to think what else was pretty remarkable this weekend.

21:06.654 --> 21:07.915
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I think she pretty much covered everything.

21:08.535 --> 21:09.276
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, fair enough then.

21:10.296 --> 21:11.677
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, my friend, how was your week?

21:11.717 --> 21:12.258
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your day?

21:14.419 --> 21:15.460
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, um...

21:16.710 --> 21:18.270
[SPEAKER_04]: My week was okay, because it was short.

21:19.571 --> 21:20.591
[SPEAKER_04]: Work-wise, it was short.

21:21.351 --> 21:24.152
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a potluck on Wednesday, and I had lots of food.

21:25.072 --> 21:27.153
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't really do anything, so that's cool.

21:28.313 --> 21:33.034
[SPEAKER_04]: Played Final Fantasy most of the week, and then... What else?

21:33.114 --> 21:35.315
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, just more DS crap.

21:35.855 --> 21:41.177
[SPEAKER_04]: Have like 41 stars now in Mario 64, and that game's frustrating as hell.

21:41.537 --> 21:41.617
[SPEAKER_04]: And...

21:42.997 --> 21:44.938
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I also bought two new games.

21:44.998 --> 21:50.760
[SPEAKER_04]: I bought Alien Hominid and Under the Skin, and those are strange.

21:50.801 --> 21:58.064
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Alien Hominid, though, because it reminds me of a hand-drawn version of Metal Slug, and it's pretty cool.

21:58.684 --> 22:01.085
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, what else did I do?

22:01.265 --> 22:08.468
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, I had to get a new cheat device thing, so I bought the Code Breaker and stuff.

22:08.548 --> 22:10.429
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that was last week that I did that, but...

22:11.178 --> 22:11.938
[SPEAKER_04]: Grand Theft Auto 3

22:43.140 --> 22:48.685
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why I bought this game, and...

23:05.245 --> 23:09.587
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that there were powers that be that coerced me into doing so against my will.

23:10.427 --> 23:13.189
[SPEAKER_03]: In other words, his girlfriend said, buy it or I'm not putting out.

23:17.411 --> 23:20.912
[SPEAKER_03]: Which, by the way, is very interesting when you consider his girlfriend is not a gamer at all.

23:21.593 --> 23:21.893
[SPEAKER_03]: At all.

23:23.413 --> 23:26.355
[SPEAKER_03]: But yet, she loves Mario 64 DS and she loves this game.

23:27.735 --> 23:28.996
[SPEAKER_03]: But I love her, so I forgive her.

23:33.160 --> 23:35.363
[SPEAKER_04]: She just likes to watch my suffering.

23:35.984 --> 23:36.825
[SPEAKER_04]: She likes to watch?

23:38.567 --> 23:39.708
[SPEAKER_04]: She likes to participate.

23:40.970 --> 23:41.651
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't know.

23:42.072 --> 23:42.472
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

23:44.014 --> 23:44.174
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

23:45.716 --> 23:46.297
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I'm done.

23:47.873 --> 23:49.875
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, my week and my day.

23:49.895 --> 23:51.978
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got to make this quick because I've got to get to a break pretty soon here.

23:52.018 --> 23:53.239
[SPEAKER_03]: But my week and my day was pretty cool.

23:53.299 --> 23:55.502
[SPEAKER_03]: I went out to Roseville Golf Land one night.

23:55.722 --> 23:56.663
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, gasp.

23:56.864 --> 23:58.866
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is the first time in months I've been there.

23:58.886 --> 24:00.548
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know we're an international show here.

24:00.588 --> 24:05.554
[SPEAKER_03]: So for those of you guys who don't know what Roseville Golf Land is, it's where Bomani games go to die, basically, and get disrepair.

24:06.234 --> 24:08.556
[SPEAKER_03]: But they have a brand new game called Derby Owners Club.

24:08.696 --> 24:10.117
[SPEAKER_08]: We went out twice this weekend.

24:10.217 --> 24:12.159
[SPEAKER_03]: And you've heard me talk about this game on the show before.

24:12.199 --> 24:14.821
[SPEAKER_03]: You've heard Jamie talk about this game zillions of times on the show before.

24:14.861 --> 24:15.482
[SPEAKER_03]: She loves this game.

24:15.922 --> 24:16.603
[SPEAKER_03]: I love this game too.

24:16.623 --> 24:17.503
[SPEAKER_03]: I made a brand new horse.

24:17.543 --> 24:19.365
[SPEAKER_03]: I called her Britney Spears so I could whip her.

24:20.185 --> 24:25.169
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was so proud of Britney because she came in second in my first race.

24:25.189 --> 24:25.950
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was very proud.

24:26.210 --> 24:30.554
[SPEAKER_03]: But where did these people come from at Golf Land who know how to play Derby Owners Club all of a sudden?

24:30.874 --> 24:31.274
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy.

24:31.294 --> 24:32.135
[SPEAKER_06]: All of them come from UCD.

24:34.357 --> 24:36.119
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen a lot of UCD up there.

24:55.199 --> 24:55.739
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

25:14.241 --> 25:16.483
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know how that feels to be on your last step?

25:16.523 --> 25:19.525
[SPEAKER_03]: And before you can hit your last step, kaboom, failed.

25:19.905 --> 25:28.172
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, if it makes you feel better, I probably couldn't even pass anything past a seven-footer at this point.

25:28.772 --> 25:32.055
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how long it's been since I've played either.

25:32.175 --> 25:37.719
[SPEAKER_08]: And yet I am the head administrator of the largest DDR site in the world.

25:38.560 --> 25:39.100
[SPEAKER_08]: What the hell?

25:39.261 --> 25:39.621
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

25:42.172 --> 25:43.073
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't get it myself.

25:43.153 --> 25:44.094
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the love of the game, though.

25:44.374 --> 25:52.560
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, honestly, I could suck at DDR, but when games like Ultramix 2 come out, I get in fanboy mode all over again, no matter if I suck at the game and I'm getting old or what.

25:53.240 --> 25:55.061
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, speaking of Ultramix 2, we've got to cut it short.

25:55.081 --> 26:00.445
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got to go to a break, because when we come back from the break, Midihead from Ultramix 2 is going to be here on the program.

26:00.685 --> 26:01.466
[SPEAKER_03]: Very excited about that.

26:01.626 --> 26:05.469
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want you guys to familiarize yourselves a little bit with Midihead, in case you forgot.

26:05.489 --> 26:09.712
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how you could, because it's one of the most kick-ass remixes we've had in a DDR game in a long time.

26:10.310 --> 26:21.735
[SPEAKER_03]: Remix of one of our favorite artists, Akira Yamaoka, took his song, made it just, I can't say made it better, but certainly not made it worse, just made it different and cool, is what he did.

26:21.815 --> 26:23.616
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's In My Eyes, the Midi Head mix.

26:24.016 --> 26:26.297
[SPEAKER_03]: Check it out, and when we come back, Midi Head will be on the program.

26:26.337 --> 26:26.757
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be back.

28:29.013 --> 28:31.354
[SPEAKER_03]: It is I. It is I. Hello, welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.

28:58.700 --> 28:59.121
[SPEAKER_21]: Greetings.

28:59.441 --> 29:00.302
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, how you doing?

29:01.764 --> 29:03.146
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, I'm doing great.

29:03.166 --> 29:05.449
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm just lounging around in my shorts.

29:06.470 --> 29:07.191
[SPEAKER_21]: I see.

29:07.772 --> 29:14.340
[SPEAKER_21]: Being as we're in Southern California, and it's actually kind of nippy outside, but

29:14.784 --> 29:17.065
[SPEAKER_21]: Here in my studio, it's nice and toasty.

29:17.245 --> 29:18.605
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been pretty cold up here, too.

29:18.645 --> 29:21.026
[SPEAKER_03]: We're based out of Sacramento, so we're not that far away.

29:21.046 --> 29:22.126
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just a stone's throw away.

29:23.026 --> 29:24.387
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not cold up there.

29:24.767 --> 29:26.888
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been freezing up here these past few days.

29:26.928 --> 29:27.708
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't you guys think so?

29:28.148 --> 29:36.030
[SPEAKER_21]: In the 40s, during... Have you guys ever been to New York City or Park City or any of those towns this time of year?

29:36.910 --> 29:42.012
[SPEAKER_03]: Not this time of year, but I went there during the summer, and that was bad enough at night, this one night, so...

29:43.455 --> 29:45.056
[SPEAKER_21]: You don't know cold, my friend!

29:46.097 --> 29:47.378
[SPEAKER_21]: That's why we live here.

29:47.999 --> 29:49.160
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly, that's why we live here.

29:49.200 --> 29:51.122
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been there, and that's why we live in California.

29:51.542 --> 29:52.043
[SPEAKER_21]: That's right.

29:53.364 --> 29:58.389
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, the folks that created Ultramix 2, they're over in Hawaii, so they've got to be loving it year-round there.

29:59.189 --> 30:07.417
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, they're getting the tropical moisture, so their skin's all nice and young-looking.

30:07.665 --> 30:10.466
[SPEAKER_03]: Except for the occasional tropical storm and things like that.

30:11.147 --> 30:12.727
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, who cares?

30:12.847 --> 30:14.408
[SPEAKER_21]: It's worth living in Hawaii for that.

30:15.208 --> 30:15.769
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

30:15.829 --> 30:17.870
[SPEAKER_03]: I would live there any old day of the week.

30:18.790 --> 30:24.453
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of Hawaii, I'm kind of curious, Middy, how did you become involved with those guys and getting into DDR Ultimix 2?

30:26.133 --> 30:35.938
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, actually, I called them on the phone one day and I bribed them and said I would give them my wife and children if they let me do the remix for them.

30:37.867 --> 30:38.147
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

30:38.227 --> 30:40.948
[SPEAKER_03]: So what will your wife and child be doing at Konami now?

30:43.249 --> 30:43.849
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

30:44.810 --> 30:49.352
[SPEAKER_21]: Now they're going to hear this and go, you sold us.

30:49.432 --> 31:05.258
[SPEAKER_21]: So really what happened is I got contacted by my label, A Different Drum, and there was a bulletin that went out to all of the artists on the label who said, hey,

31:06.961 --> 31:18.083
[SPEAKER_21]: Konami wants to do this remix and they also want track submissions for the Ultramix 2 game and anybody who's interested can hear the details.

31:18.123 --> 31:34.107
[SPEAKER_21]: So basically I just got the tracks, the original tracks from Konami and it was kind of a free-for-all so I just did one and just kind of submitted it not really thinking that it was going to go anywhere

31:35.587 --> 31:47.934
[SPEAKER_21]: and next thing I know I get a call from Jaron Tolman, who's one of their head sound designers down there, and he said, hey, Konami liked it so much they want you to do an extended remix.

31:48.495 --> 31:52.157
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, which is the one we see on the V-Rare, that super long mix, right?

31:52.677 --> 31:53.537
[SPEAKER_21]: Super long!

31:53.557 --> 31:54.438
[SPEAKER_03]: Super long!

31:54.458 --> 31:57.980
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, so that's how I got involved.

31:59.309 --> 32:00.270
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool, very cool.

32:00.390 --> 32:04.314
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's lots of great music from a different drum, including Ultramix 2.

32:04.634 --> 32:19.409
[SPEAKER_03]: And I gotta tell you, I don't know how much of the scene you've kind of been watching and kind of the reaction from the DDR fans, but a lot of folks have been really into Ultramix 2 and they kind of credit a lot of the success of the game because of the song list and because of a lot of the music that comes from a different drum.

32:19.709 --> 32:21.051
[SPEAKER_03]: Fans such as Echo Image...

32:21.411 --> 32:24.913
[SPEAKER_03]: Day Behavior, and all those folks, and yourself, all coming over from a different drum.

32:25.113 --> 32:25.673
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been great.

32:25.733 --> 32:27.534
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a great, I think, collaboration.

32:27.574 --> 32:29.535
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you guys work together more in the future.

32:30.215 --> 32:42.060
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, you know, I know that Konami's let the door open, so they've really liked what's come out of a different drum, and myself included.

32:43.601 --> 32:45.282
[SPEAKER_21]: So, what they...

32:46.731 --> 32:56.299
[SPEAKER_21]: What they're grateful for is the fact they're not dealing with these prima donnas on these larger labels.

32:57.860 --> 33:03.865
[SPEAKER_21]: They have all these demands and we just want to get our music out there and get it to the fans.

33:04.684 --> 33:09.165
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, I would dance to Skulk, Close Your Eyes, The In My Eyes remix.

33:09.205 --> 33:14.786
[SPEAKER_03]: I would dance to that long before I danced to Britney on DDR.

33:14.806 --> 33:19.807
[SPEAKER_21]: You say that now, but if Britney was now standing in front of you with... Yeah, that's a good point.

33:20.427 --> 33:21.448
[SPEAKER_21]: Britney, I'm your biggest fan.

33:21.828 --> 33:22.608
[SPEAKER_21]: Come on, I know.

33:24.208 --> 33:27.349
[SPEAKER_21]: She'd be dancing to Britney all night if she was sitting right there in your recliner.

33:29.797 --> 33:30.277
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a point.

33:30.517 --> 33:37.763
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to ask, since we're kind of talking about DDR here, did you know about DDR before you became involved with the project?

33:37.783 --> 33:38.663
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you ever play it?

33:38.703 --> 33:39.724
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you mentioned you had a kid.

33:40.064 --> 33:44.007
[SPEAKER_21]: I got to tell you guys, this is going to piss off some of your listeners.

33:44.248 --> 33:44.808
[SPEAKER_21]: That's all right.

33:44.828 --> 33:48.010
[SPEAKER_03]: We piss them off enough.

33:48.331 --> 33:57.858
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, I used to be extremely into video games and found them to, it was kind of,

33:58.208 --> 34:16.239
[SPEAKER_21]: I won't say it's a waste of time, but for me, it was like getting in the way of producing albums, and basically, since I have a family, I have to be a responsible adult now, so I kind of got out of the whole video game thing.

34:16.279 --> 34:19.861
[SPEAKER_21]: I used to be heavily into, do you guys remember Descent?

34:21.062 --> 34:23.344
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh yeah, I used to play that, yeah.

34:25.230 --> 34:37.363
[SPEAKER_21]: and then, you know, most recently I was heavily into the Quake 3 add-on mod, Urban Terror.

34:38.044 --> 34:38.785
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, okay.

34:39.085 --> 34:40.046
[SPEAKER_21]: Man after my own heart.

34:40.887 --> 34:43.950
[SPEAKER_21]: That is by far the best game I've played to date.

34:44.110 --> 34:44.210
[SPEAKER_03]: Now...

34:45.467 --> 34:47.087
[SPEAKER_21]: I've never played BDR, though, guys.

34:47.127 --> 34:47.647
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sorry.

34:47.968 --> 34:48.568
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all right.

34:48.608 --> 34:49.028
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all right.

34:49.188 --> 34:54.709
[SPEAKER_03]: You were talking some stuff to me before the show that I totally wasn't getting either, so now we're even, okay?

34:54.989 --> 34:56.949
[SPEAKER_03]: We're even.

34:57.089 --> 35:03.391
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, you sound like the kind of guy, though, that if you were still playing video games, you would be playing Halo 2 with the rest of us right now, I think.

35:04.091 --> 35:08.232
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I would be playing until my usual 4 or 5 o'clock in the morning.

35:08.292 --> 35:11.952
[SPEAKER_03]: And you would be getting your ass kicked by 13-year-olds, just like the rest of us do.

35:12.052 --> 35:12.592
[SPEAKER_21]: Exactly.

35:12.632 --> 35:14.793
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, what's funny is I actually had a...

35:15.652 --> 35:23.780
[SPEAKER_21]: I had a 13-year-old show me some moves on Urban Terror one night late when we had the whole entire board to ourselves while everybody else went to bed.

35:26.142 --> 35:26.823
[SPEAKER_21]: It was kind of funny.

35:27.804 --> 35:33.950
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm 33 and this little 13-year-old is showing me stuff that I would have never figured out on my own.

35:34.338 --> 35:34.718
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

35:35.779 --> 35:36.780
[SPEAKER_03]: The kids these days.

35:37.740 --> 35:38.481
[SPEAKER_03]: The kids these days?

35:38.561 --> 35:39.922
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel so old saying that myself.

35:39.942 --> 35:44.405
[SPEAKER_13]: Where is our youth going?

35:45.086 --> 35:51.730
[SPEAKER_03]: Midyette, I wanted to ask you about the song that you specifically remixed, In My Eyes, a track originally done by Akira Yamaoka.

35:52.431 --> 35:58.555
[SPEAKER_03]: You kind of mentioned that you had a lot of the original Konami tracks, so was it your choice to remix that particular song?

35:59.676 --> 36:01.037
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, you know, I think...

36:04.344 --> 36:16.793
[SPEAKER_21]: Out of the two songs that I was given, that one kind of stuck out the most because the chord progression, I knew right away what to do with it when I heard it.

36:18.315 --> 36:28.222
[SPEAKER_21]: I pretty much took out all of his musical elements, left the vocals, and just redid everything from the ground up.

36:28.723 --> 36:39.626
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you can tell that, like, a lot of... It's not just, you know, you took a song and added a new beat to it, but you just totally kind of deconstructed it and then built it from the ground up, and I think that's part of what's so great about it.

36:40.226 --> 36:40.526
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

36:40.546 --> 36:41.186
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

36:41.206 --> 36:41.626
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

36:42.167 --> 36:43.247
[SPEAKER_03]: No problem, no problem, anytime.

36:44.047 --> 36:46.588
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you gotten a chance to talk to Akira about the remix at all?

36:46.628 --> 36:48.308
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you got a chance to meet him.

36:48.328 --> 36:51.009
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, you know, he and I talk every day, and he calls me...

36:52.219 --> 36:55.880
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, we got to talk to him one time, and unfortunately we didn't get him on air.

36:55.920 --> 36:59.061
[SPEAKER_03]: We got to talk to him one time, and I tell you, we were just giddy little fanboys.

36:59.141 --> 36:59.901
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just amazing.

36:59.981 --> 37:02.841
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know if you've ever played... No, actually, I haven't spoke to him.

37:02.881 --> 37:05.822
[SPEAKER_21]: I have no idea how he feels about the remix whatsoever.

37:06.802 --> 37:07.222
[SPEAKER_03]: No clue.

37:07.322 --> 37:08.003
[SPEAKER_03]: We should find out.

37:08.023 --> 37:09.103
[SPEAKER_03]: We have ways of finding out.

37:09.743 --> 37:14.024
[SPEAKER_21]: For all I know, he thinks, you know, this is garbage.

37:14.988 --> 37:16.529
[SPEAKER_21]: What has he done to my song?

37:16.689 --> 37:17.549
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

37:17.589 --> 37:18.710
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm sure he loves it.

37:18.750 --> 37:22.471
[SPEAKER_03]: Trust me, there's been some remixes in DDR in the past that were absolute garbage.

37:22.951 --> 37:24.392
[SPEAKER_03]: Yours is not garbage.

37:24.472 --> 37:25.472
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't worry about it.

37:25.532 --> 37:26.473
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

37:27.013 --> 37:28.213
[SPEAKER_21]: My head is swelling now.

37:28.754 --> 37:29.454
[SPEAKER_21]: It's huge.

37:29.714 --> 37:29.954
[SPEAKER_03]: You're right.

37:29.994 --> 37:30.915
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to stop.

37:31.755 --> 37:34.416
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of equipment do you use to do these remixes in your studio?

37:35.768 --> 37:42.353
[SPEAKER_21]: Actually, I'm a big fan of... See, this will all go over your head.

37:42.553 --> 37:43.894
[SPEAKER_21]: We're back to the over your head thing.

37:44.034 --> 37:44.675
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, that's fine.

37:44.835 --> 37:46.716
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe some of our listeners will catch up on it.

37:46.836 --> 37:47.136
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

37:48.117 --> 37:52.140
[SPEAKER_21]: So, I actually use acid, and I'm not talking about white blotter.

37:52.960 --> 37:57.083
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, now, my co-host Loki is very familiar with acid.

37:57.103 --> 37:58.464
[SPEAKER_03]: He does his own remixing in acid.

37:58.504 --> 37:59.485
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that I know.

37:59.505 --> 38:00.425
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm with you so far.

38:00.445 --> 38:01.226
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, cool, cool.

38:01.666 --> 38:03.107
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, you know, a lot of people have...

38:04.915 --> 38:05.416
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks for watching!

38:17.492 --> 38:19.013
[SPEAKER_21]: Really cool stuff.

38:19.113 --> 38:21.614
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, I've been using it since the program first came out.

38:21.834 --> 38:25.515
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to point out, I'm sorry, I hate to cut you off, but I've got to say this.

38:25.595 --> 38:42.142
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got to say this, because there's been these amateur remix contests that have happened throughout the Bomani scene that go on on such big websites, and they want to get people to remix stuff, and they always say, don't use Acid, because we want a program that is, we want something that doesn't sound like two songs meshed together.

38:42.502 --> 38:46.264
[SPEAKER_03]: I would just like to point out, the pros have just said that they use Acid.

38:47.549 --> 38:49.731
[SPEAKER_03]: So STFU, guys, STFU.

38:51.853 --> 39:01.081
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, it's a great program, especially now in version 5, but I use Acid in conjunction with, you know, I do a lot of the elements live, so I don't sequence much.

39:01.181 --> 39:07.246
[SPEAKER_21]: I actually just hit the record button, and we'll just play the sequence live.

39:07.747 --> 39:11.991
[SPEAKER_21]: If it's an arpeggiated piece, you know, that of course is sequenced, but...

39:14.085 --> 39:18.786
[SPEAKER_21]: Most of it goes live into acid, then I just chop it up and dice it up and move stuff around.

39:18.806 --> 39:20.766
[SPEAKER_21]: It's just a lot faster that way.

39:20.786 --> 39:26.787
[SPEAKER_21]: And I use virtual instruments in addition to my Axis Virus KC.

39:26.847 --> 39:40.429
[SPEAKER_21]: I have all the Spectrasonics Stylus RMX, Atmosphere Trilogy, and of course, I've got software from Vanguard.

39:40.469 --> 39:41.730
[SPEAKER_21]: I use Vanguard and Zeta.

39:42.870 --> 39:43.010
[SPEAKER_21]: And...

39:44.947 --> 39:45.947
[SPEAKER_21]: I love SoftSense.

39:47.388 --> 39:48.088
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.

39:48.168 --> 39:49.529
[SPEAKER_03]: Now see, Loki's following you here.

39:49.569 --> 39:50.609
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe that's just... Alright.

39:51.689 --> 39:55.991
[SPEAKER_04]: See, well, I mean, you know, basically the stuff I do is very, very, very amateur.

39:56.031 --> 40:01.193
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm not even going as far as calling them actual remixes, more of just white label remixes and stuff.

40:01.513 --> 40:06.474
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, I don't really have the talent at the moment to be actually creating my own stuff.

40:06.494 --> 40:10.796
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically it's a lot of loop chopping and adding in a little bit of elements that way, but

40:11.257 --> 40:12.198
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

40:41.867 --> 40:42.687
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I guess.

40:44.569 --> 40:44.849
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

40:45.890 --> 40:48.933
[SPEAKER_03]: You were mentioning that there was kind of two songs that you were sent.

40:49.433 --> 40:54.338
[SPEAKER_03]: Were there actually other songs that you remixed for DDR that didn't make it onto Ultramix 2?

40:54.958 --> 40:56.240
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, come on now.

40:56.300 --> 40:59.322
[SPEAKER_21]: Would I have remixed a song that wouldn't have made it on DDR?

41:00.083 --> 41:06.469
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, maybe I'm thinking maybe you're one of those artists that construct something and then you go, no, it's crap, it's crap, and you throw it out.

41:06.489 --> 41:07.169
[SPEAKER_21]: No, no, no, no, no.

41:08.436 --> 41:09.676
[SPEAKER_21]: No, man, I've been doing this since 1989.

41:09.836 --> 41:14.618
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, you know, that whole phase has been definitely worked out of me.

41:15.298 --> 41:19.519
[SPEAKER_21]: But, no, actually, this was the one song I remixed.

41:20.139 --> 41:24.340
[SPEAKER_21]: It was kind of a stab in the dark, and I threw it out there, and lo and behold.

41:25.660 --> 41:26.721
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool, very cool.

41:27.381 --> 41:30.842
[SPEAKER_03]: And you mentioned that you might be doing this again for another Konami project.

41:30.882 --> 41:34.182
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you see yourself being involved with a future Konami game?

41:34.823 --> 41:36.203
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, sure, yeah, definitely.

41:36.844 --> 41:41.486
[SPEAKER_21]: Nothing specific at the moment, but like I said earlier, the door's open.

41:42.147 --> 41:45.368
[SPEAKER_21]: We've been in talks about keeping in touch and doing more.

41:46.209 --> 41:49.951
[SPEAKER_21]: They've been really happy with this last remix.

41:50.051 --> 41:51.251
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not just the remix.

41:51.271 --> 41:54.053
[SPEAKER_21]: You have to look at the actual business side, too.

41:54.193 --> 42:00.316
[SPEAKER_21]: If you're easy to deal with as an artist, this is just tips going out there to people trying to get their foot in the door.

42:01.156 --> 42:04.278
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not just the quality of the work that you do.

42:04.438 --> 42:04.558
[SPEAKER_21]: It's

42:05.111 --> 42:08.253
[SPEAKER_21]: It's also your attitude and your business dealings with these guys.

42:08.593 --> 42:20.100
[SPEAKER_21]: If you're a professional from start to finish and you're very proficient and attentive, a lot of people make great music but can't get work.

42:20.780 --> 42:24.262
[SPEAKER_21]: It's because they don't have the relationship thing down.

42:24.322 --> 42:28.565
[SPEAKER_21]: You've got to be able to have a good working relationship with these guys.

42:29.205 --> 42:30.226
[SPEAKER_03]: I absolutely agree.

42:30.266 --> 42:33.327
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I am all about kissing ass on this program.

42:33.507 --> 42:34.028
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, carefully.

42:35.003 --> 42:36.587
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you get the chocolates I sent you?

42:36.687 --> 42:37.068
[SPEAKER_03]: Middy Head.

42:39.194 --> 42:40.136
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

42:40.156 --> 42:41.519
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you get the chocolates we sent?

42:42.236 --> 43:11.308
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah exactly I have a brown nose too now if the folks that are listening go on over to your website over at www.mittyhead.com and I hope that they do because it's a great website you notice that there's a lot of other stuff that you've worked with before you did some TV gigs you did some movie things in the past before but what I want to know have you worked with video game music ever before was this the first thing

43:12.006 --> 43:13.766
[SPEAKER_21]: No, I've never worked with video game music before.

43:14.647 --> 43:21.168
[SPEAKER_21]: I moved out here to Los Angeles to try some things.

43:21.648 --> 43:29.290
[SPEAKER_21]: The first stuff I did was for Fox Television's Dark Angel.

43:29.770 --> 43:41.373
[SPEAKER_21]: When that happened, I started landing tracks through my publisher in a lot of different television shows and then was able to get one landed in the Matrix Reloaded movie trailer

43:42.046 --> 43:43.747
[SPEAKER_21]: Just prior to the film's release.

43:45.188 --> 43:47.489
[SPEAKER_21]: So that had been most of my experience.

43:47.849 --> 43:52.032
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'd looked into video games several times going, you know, I should do that.

43:52.072 --> 43:52.832
[SPEAKER_21]: I should get into that.

43:53.412 --> 43:54.713
[SPEAKER_21]: I had no idea how.

43:55.754 --> 43:57.114
[SPEAKER_21]: I had friends that were doing it.

43:57.494 --> 43:59.576
[SPEAKER_21]: And I asked them how I'd get involved.

43:59.596 --> 44:06.039
[SPEAKER_21]: And they said, you know, it's a nightmare trying to get in there because so many people are trying to do it.

44:06.880 --> 44:11.222
[SPEAKER_21]: So I just never really pursued it because I always had other things that I...

44:11.986 --> 44:12.366
[SPEAKER_21]: and many more.

44:34.141 --> 44:34.761
[SPEAKER_21]: are doing well.

44:36.202 --> 44:40.505
[SPEAKER_03]: There are folks who actually were in Ultramix 2 that are quite familiar with the video game music stuff.

44:40.685 --> 44:45.867
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesper Kidd, I know, is one of them, and he's done a lot of previous video game stuff, and now he's kind of crossing over into DDR.

44:45.907 --> 44:54.032
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, there's lots of, I think, opportunities for making great music for video games out there, you know, especially what they keep saying is getting bigger than movies now.

44:54.272 --> 44:54.692
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

44:54.852 --> 44:55.393
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, who knows?

44:55.593 --> 44:55.873
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

44:56.587 --> 45:03.190
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I know you're going to be putting in a live appearance at this upcoming convention, this OtakuCon, is that what it's called?

45:03.610 --> 45:04.591
[SPEAKER_20]: OtakuCon?

45:05.591 --> 45:06.312
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on with that?

45:06.352 --> 45:07.212
[SPEAKER_03]: How'd you get involved with that?

45:08.693 --> 45:11.654
[SPEAKER_21]: Again, you know, my label got involved in that.

45:12.015 --> 45:20.299
[SPEAKER_21]: They were contacted, a different drum was contacted by OtakuCon about having a different drum be involved, and of course...

45:21.658 --> 45:28.441
[SPEAKER_21]: Because of my involvement in DDR, I was one of the first artists contacted to be in that.

45:29.602 --> 45:32.523
[SPEAKER_03]: The otakus love DDR, just so you know.

45:32.663 --> 45:33.824
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh yeah, yeah.

45:33.844 --> 45:37.466
[SPEAKER_21]: So we'll be performing that track live on stage.

45:39.526 --> 45:42.288
[SPEAKER_03]: Just so you guys know, that's going to be in Miami Beach.

45:42.448 --> 45:47.310
[SPEAKER_03]: If any of you guys are in that area or planning on traveling, the convention is happening December 17th through the 19th.

45:47.350 --> 45:50.272
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to check out more information, it's otakucon.com.

45:50.292 --> 45:51.092
[SPEAKER_03]: The midi head is going to be there.

45:54.060 --> 45:56.662
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll be there with some Tasty Babes up on stage, my friend.

45:56.902 --> 45:58.844
[SPEAKER_03]: I always perform with Tasty Babes.

45:58.864 --> 46:00.346
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to have the dual sex appeal.

46:00.366 --> 46:03.148
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, they actually do have talent.

46:15.772 --> 46:16.552
[SPEAKER_03]: and so on.

46:36.431 --> 46:37.232
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

47:01.992 --> 47:06.636
[SPEAKER_03]: I really, to be honest, I had no clue a lot of this music was out there before DDR.

47:07.036 --> 47:15.723
[SPEAKER_03]: It was kind of like, because of my involvement with this show, I kind of, you know, when this music was announced, I kind of went on over to the site and I was kind of checking out some of the music by the artists.

47:15.763 --> 47:16.784
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, this stuff is great.

47:17.305 --> 47:18.125
[SPEAKER_03]: This stuff is really great.

47:18.226 --> 47:21.949
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it's stuff you probably wouldn't hear of if you didn't think to look.

47:21.989 --> 47:23.610
[SPEAKER_21]: It's definitely not the mainstream.

47:23.630 --> 47:24.110
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely not.

47:24.250 --> 47:25.692
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, it's synth pop.

47:26.592 --> 47:29.235
[SPEAKER_21]: And what's interesting, though, is because...

47:30.320 --> 47:34.881
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know how old you guys are, but I don't know if you remember the 80s at all.

47:35.781 --> 47:36.321
[SPEAKER_21]: A little bit.

47:36.701 --> 47:38.262
[SPEAKER_21]: A guano girl is lighting up over there.

47:38.282 --> 47:39.562
[SPEAKER_21]: It was a blur, man.

47:39.622 --> 47:41.062
[SPEAKER_07]: If it makes you feel better, I'm 27.

47:41.702 --> 47:43.663
[SPEAKER_21]: I was just passing out of the uterus then.

47:43.683 --> 47:45.683
[SPEAKER_21]: No, no, no, no.

47:46.003 --> 47:49.224
[SPEAKER_03]: I may sound young, but I'm actually 26, so I do remember the 80s.

47:49.264 --> 47:50.444
[SPEAKER_21]: You're not that young, man.

47:50.544 --> 47:51.584
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, all right, cool.

47:51.924 --> 47:52.544
[SPEAKER_21]: We remember the 80s.

47:52.604 --> 47:53.005
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all good.

47:55.755 --> 48:03.899
[SPEAKER_21]: I used to DJ in the 80s, and so a lot of the music that comes off via different drum label is kind of reminiscent of that era.

48:05.619 --> 48:06.740
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm loving, too.

48:06.800 --> 48:14.663
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the Naropa song, I remember when I heard that the first time, I was like, it's like Depeche Mode meets Erasure meets, like, cool.

48:14.723 --> 48:15.644
[SPEAKER_03]: I just loved it.

48:16.707 --> 48:18.408
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely a lot of 80s remnants and stuff in there.

48:18.809 --> 48:19.889
[SPEAKER_10]: Very cool.

48:19.950 --> 48:21.351
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to pass this along to you now.

48:21.391 --> 48:25.254
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually have somebody in our chat room right now over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

48:25.274 --> 48:25.734
[SPEAKER_03]: Click on chat.

48:26.074 --> 48:28.136
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody that works for Konami.

48:28.776 --> 48:36.702
[SPEAKER_03]: And he actually says that their product manager, Jason Enos, said that Akira has heard the remix you did and he likes it a lot.

48:37.183 --> 48:38.143
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm supposed to let you know.

48:38.584 --> 48:39.284
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm supposed to let you know.

48:40.265 --> 48:42.187
[SPEAKER_03]: Right on.

48:42.287 --> 48:44.989
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, I'm glad that the information could come to us that fast.

48:45.029 --> 48:46.050
[SPEAKER_21]: God bless the internet.

48:46.070 --> 48:46.490
[SPEAKER_21]: Look at that.

48:47.006 --> 48:49.487
[SPEAKER_21]: A first ever in the life of Middy Head.

48:49.527 --> 48:50.847
[SPEAKER_21]: He hears from the man himself.

48:51.987 --> 48:52.888
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm not really the man.

48:53.248 --> 48:55.288
[SPEAKER_21]: Live on Orange Lounge Radio.

48:56.649 --> 48:58.889
[SPEAKER_21]: That was my best Roger Radio voice, by the way.

48:59.189 --> 49:00.790
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the Morning Drive.

49:01.390 --> 49:04.571
[SPEAKER_21]: Welcome to the Morning Drive.

49:08.629 --> 49:11.271
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go on over to Iguana Girl and check on that traffic.

49:11.892 --> 49:15.335
[SPEAKER_21]: We've got an accident on the I-5.

49:15.715 --> 49:24.802
[SPEAKER_21]: I used to intern at a Top 40 radio station back when I was 14 years old is when I started to get into radio.

49:27.004 --> 49:35.230
[SPEAKER_21]: I sat down in the general manager's office at the radio station about the time I was 16 years old, and he said, Mike,

49:35.974 --> 49:40.660
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sorry to tell you this, but I don't think you have the voice for radio.

49:41.361 --> 49:46.208
[SPEAKER_21]: So I passed up the career, guys.

49:47.109 --> 49:50.053
[SPEAKER_21]: I know it sounds like I should have stuck with it, but...

49:53.317 --> 49:58.299
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to admit, I've hit a few roadblocks on my way up the radio ladder.

49:58.319 --> 50:00.100
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why I'm stuck here doing internet radio.

50:00.420 --> 50:09.064
[SPEAKER_03]: But see, the way I figure is that together, when we work together like this, when the indie labels come together with the indie radio stations, we're going to take over the world!

50:10.325 --> 50:11.045
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, man!

50:11.105 --> 50:12.245
[SPEAKER_07]: Define and conquer!

50:13.446 --> 50:14.386
[SPEAKER_07]: Power to the people!

50:16.027 --> 50:16.447
[SPEAKER_03]: Right on.

50:17.108 --> 50:18.008
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, what...

50:19.488 --> 50:21.650
[SPEAKER_03]: What other kind of future projects are you working on right now?

50:21.670 --> 50:23.652
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you've done work for TV and movies.

50:23.712 --> 50:25.634
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anything else upcoming that we can look forward to?

50:27.956 --> 50:32.120
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I'm going to be in several B-movies.

50:34.101 --> 50:37.585
[SPEAKER_21]: Since I'm in the Los Angeles area, there will be some of the adult film.

50:40.247 --> 50:41.228
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

50:41.428 --> 50:43.370
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, I hope everybody knows I'm just kidding.

50:44.275 --> 50:44.595
[SPEAKER_03]: You were?

50:44.695 --> 50:46.456
[SPEAKER_03]: No, yeah, yeah, okay, we're not kidding.

50:47.236 --> 50:49.196
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was looking forward to some Bow Chicka Bow Wow.

50:49.856 --> 50:51.217
[SPEAKER_21]: Bow Chicka Bow Wow.

50:51.697 --> 50:59.679
[SPEAKER_21]: But no, I'm actually working on a new album, and the title of the album is called Weapons of Mass Seduction.

51:02.219 --> 51:03.500
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds porno right there.

51:04.120 --> 51:13.062
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, you know, I was afraid of that originally when I thought of the title, but because of my frustration with the media...

51:14.271 --> 51:20.536
[SPEAKER_21]: and pretty much just turning on the local television stations here in California.

51:20.576 --> 51:21.897
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know.

51:21.977 --> 51:32.344
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't want to get into politics, but I'm more of a conservative kind of guy than I would say liberal.

51:32.364 --> 51:33.184
[SPEAKER_21]: It just frustrates me.

51:34.318 --> 51:36.619
[SPEAKER_21]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

52:05.324 --> 52:10.086
[SPEAKER_03]: If they like that remix and are thinking, hmm, I want to check out some more Midihead stuff, where can they go to check some stuff out?

52:10.766 --> 52:12.687
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I think you said it earlier.

52:12.707 --> 52:13.507
[SPEAKER_21]: Everybody with me, ready?

52:14.608 --> 52:19.710
[SPEAKER_21]: www.midihead.com Works for me, works for me.

52:21.290 --> 52:23.371
[SPEAKER_03]: You have other albums out there right now too, right?

52:23.391 --> 52:30.694
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I have the first album I released called Power Undiminished.

52:32.091 --> 52:41.837
[SPEAKER_21]: The American Synth Pop Award in 2001 here in Hollywood, California for Best Album.

52:42.838 --> 52:50.282
[SPEAKER_21]: Also, more recently than that, Dividing Asunder.

52:52.443 --> 53:00.108
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm actually going to be doing my own radio broadcast here sometime next year.

53:00.618 --> 53:14.131
[SPEAKER_21]: in the month of December before OtakuCon, where there will be a world premiere listening of my latest track, which has not been released yet, and that one's titled Away From Here.

53:14.851 --> 53:15.352
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, okay.

53:16.253 --> 53:21.698
[SPEAKER_21]: So I guess just check the website for that information, and I'll keep you posted.

53:22.038 --> 53:22.458
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds good.

53:22.478 --> 53:25.361
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're trying to break into the Internet radio world as well, huh?

53:25.976 --> 53:28.818
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, no, not... You know, I think it's fun.

53:28.838 --> 53:32.240
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, what you guys are doing, it sounds like you guys are having a good time.

53:32.460 --> 53:32.680
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.

53:32.881 --> 53:37.544
[SPEAKER_21]: And, you know, I've always wanted to do my own show since I was a small kid.

53:38.584 --> 53:40.886
[SPEAKER_21]: And Internet has allowed us to do that.

53:41.426 --> 53:41.966
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

53:42.427 --> 53:45.969
[SPEAKER_21]: And, you know, I'm just going to try it out and see how I like it.

53:46.539 --> 53:49.341
[SPEAKER_21]: and maybe I'll do a once a month broadcast or something.

53:49.561 --> 53:51.163
[SPEAKER_03]: Be careful, it's really addicting.

53:51.923 --> 53:53.965
[SPEAKER_03]: Iguana Girl, how long have we been doing this?

53:54.005 --> 53:56.607
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been doing it for a couple years at least?

53:57.027 --> 53:58.888
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, yeah, probably like four or five now.

53:58.968 --> 54:03.572
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been involved in various shows for probably about five or six years, so it's pretty addicting.

54:04.219 --> 54:07.340
[SPEAKER_21]: You guys are doing Live 365, right?

54:07.440 --> 54:10.480
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this current program we're doing is through Live 365, Orange Sounds Radio.

54:10.540 --> 54:13.441
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're great to us, too.

54:13.521 --> 54:16.561
[SPEAKER_03]: So they've got a lot of great services for anybody that's looking into.

54:17.562 --> 54:24.763
[SPEAKER_03]: Even when they forgot to mention our name at the Best of Live 365 Awards, in which we were nominated in a category, and they completely forgot us.

54:25.563 --> 54:26.523
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a tragedy, man.

54:26.744 --> 54:27.664
[SPEAKER_03]: We forgave them for it.

54:27.684 --> 54:28.944
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have the clip?

54:31.556 --> 54:32.496
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish we had the clip.

54:32.556 --> 54:37.498
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love for Mitty Head to hear the clip because it's hilarious and I don't think our listeners have heard the clip in a long time either.

54:37.518 --> 54:38.798
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have to dig that up.

54:38.978 --> 54:44.140
[SPEAKER_21]: Wait, did they actually, you recorded the clip of them apologizing?

54:44.160 --> 54:53.822
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the whole thing was broadcasted live and one of our listeners recorded it and sent the whole thing to us because it's hilarious because you can hear us in the background going, Hey!

54:54.423 --> 54:55.723
[SPEAKER_03]: They forgot our name.

54:56.983 --> 54:57.624
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty funny.

54:59.565 --> 55:02.847
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, I wanted to go ahead and allow our listeners a chance to ask some questions.

55:03.227 --> 55:08.530
[SPEAKER_03]: OrangeLoungeRadio.com, click on chat, and you can submit some questions live to us via our chat room.

55:09.130 --> 55:12.052
[SPEAKER_03]: For instance, we have Legend of Zaku is in our chat room.

55:12.072 --> 55:13.113
[SPEAKER_03]: He has a question for you here.

55:13.473 --> 55:17.255
[SPEAKER_03]: He wants to know, how did you approach doing the remixing itself?

55:17.335 --> 55:21.217
[SPEAKER_03]: In other words, what kind of inspired you to go about making the remix that you did?

55:22.918 --> 55:25.019
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that I wanted to come from a...

55:29.353 --> 55:31.074
[SPEAKER_21]: A cinematic sort of feel.

55:31.715 --> 55:41.820
[SPEAKER_21]: If you listen to the beginning of the track, it kind of starts out with some heavy, thunderous noises and stuff like that.

55:41.880 --> 55:52.865
[SPEAKER_21]: So I kind of wanted it to be a very intense track, because I felt the vocal was conveying a sort of intensity there, and a seriousness.

55:53.906 --> 55:54.006
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

55:55.019 --> 55:56.219
[SPEAKER_21]: Does that answer the question?

55:56.359 --> 55:57.840
[SPEAKER_21]: I think so, I think so.

55:58.420 --> 56:03.281
[SPEAKER_03]: They're responding to it in chat, they're saying, kind of giving it that epic sound, a little bit.

56:03.301 --> 56:07.422
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I wanted to, you know, but that's kind of how my sound is, hence the name Monolithic.

56:07.582 --> 56:11.123
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, everything I do has an epic kind of sound to it.

56:11.263 --> 56:18.685
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that was something that we didn't quite kind of get into a little bit there before, but you actually work under several different names, not just Midihead, but Monolithic as well.

56:19.265 --> 56:19.685
[SPEAKER_21]: That's right.

56:19.865 --> 56:20.665
[SPEAKER_03]: So are there any other...

56:21.471 --> 56:23.312
[SPEAKER_03]: pseudonyms that you use as well for music?

56:23.393 --> 56:26.575
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, there is the sexy skinny guy.

56:29.157 --> 56:29.537
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, wait a minute.

56:29.557 --> 56:30.418
[SPEAKER_21]: I thought that was my name.

56:30.438 --> 56:35.202
[SPEAKER_21]: I had the trademark on that name.

56:35.902 --> 56:36.463
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's see.

56:37.083 --> 56:37.924
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, Trent Reznor.

56:38.284 --> 56:39.825
[SPEAKER_21]: You know him?

56:39.945 --> 56:40.686
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, all right.

56:42.347 --> 56:42.808
[SPEAKER_21]: No, no.

56:42.908 --> 56:43.788
[SPEAKER_21]: No, I'm sorry.

56:44.009 --> 56:46.050
[SPEAKER_21]: I wouldn't want to own up to that guy.

56:46.691 --> 56:49.313
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, he's got great talent and everything.

56:49.333 --> 56:49.573
[SPEAKER_21]: He just

56:50.236 --> 56:50.976
[SPEAKER_21]: That's a different direction.

56:50.996 --> 56:51.557
[SPEAKER_21]: He's just crazy.

56:52.177 --> 56:54.178
[SPEAKER_21]: A little different direction.

56:55.119 --> 56:59.301
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what's interesting is there's actually one guy that does a lot, a lot of music for DDR and Naoki.

56:59.321 --> 57:01.182
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you've heard of him or not.

57:01.222 --> 57:01.882
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got a lot of tracks.

57:02.202 --> 57:07.245
[SPEAKER_03]: But that guy probably has like, what, 20 to 30 different pseudonyms he's done music under.

57:07.605 --> 57:08.205
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy.

57:08.285 --> 57:09.446
[SPEAKER_21]: You know what?

57:09.546 --> 57:10.347
[SPEAKER_21]: That's the way you do it.

57:10.587 --> 57:14.169
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know how many of the pseudonyms you know that Prince has.

57:14.189 --> 57:14.589
[SPEAKER_21]: True.

57:14.829 --> 57:18.431
[SPEAKER_21]: But Prince has tons and tons of pseudonyms.

57:18.471 --> 57:18.771
[SPEAKER_21]: He's really...

57:19.167 --> 57:19.347
[SPEAKER_21]: and so on.

57:42.611 --> 57:43.892
[SPEAKER_21]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

58:06.190 --> 58:08.632
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a comment from Sigurd in our chatroom.

58:08.652 --> 58:12.635
[SPEAKER_03]: He's the guy that actually works at Konami, and what Sigurd did at Konami is he was one of the testers.

58:12.655 --> 58:17.359
[SPEAKER_21]: Wait a minute, before you get going here, is this chatroom just full of folks from Konami here?

58:17.900 --> 58:19.641
[SPEAKER_03]: No, just the one.

58:19.881 --> 58:24.905
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, it's just fanboys and girls just like the rest of us that just love the games.

58:25.586 --> 58:31.591
[SPEAKER_03]: Sigurd's one of those cases where he was someone that was a fan and then actually kind of got in the door and got to work on one of the games.

58:31.971 --> 58:32.731
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.

58:32.852 --> 58:34.473
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he's a great guy.

58:34.953 --> 58:35.734
[SPEAKER_03]: He's been on the show before.

58:35.774 --> 58:36.514
[SPEAKER_03]: We like having him on.

58:36.534 --> 58:38.516
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, we might have him on later tonight.

58:38.776 --> 58:42.759
[SPEAKER_03]: But he worked on the steps, actually, part of the steps for DDR.

58:43.060 --> 58:49.645
[SPEAKER_03]: And he wanted you to know that the step creation team thought that your song was easily one of the top songs that they had to work with.

58:49.905 --> 58:50.906
[SPEAKER_03]: So he just wanted to pass that along.

58:51.606 --> 58:52.307
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, that's great.

58:52.467 --> 58:53.368
[SPEAKER_21]: Tell him thank you.

58:54.308 --> 58:55.750
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he's listening, so hopefully he heard that.

58:56.270 --> 58:56.870
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, thank you.

58:56.930 --> 58:57.911
[SPEAKER_21]: You're a sweet man.

58:58.592 --> 58:59.152
[SPEAKER_03]: I love you.

59:00.854 --> 59:01.775
[SPEAKER_21]: and No I'm Not Gay.

59:03.696 --> 59:04.017
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

59:04.197 --> 59:05.338
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean that plutonically.

59:06.538 --> 59:06.879
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright.

59:07.419 --> 59:13.264
[SPEAKER_03]: Flaronay has a question, wants to know what other artists from the different drum label have you collaborated with in the past?

59:14.385 --> 59:16.086
[SPEAKER_21]: I've actually collaborated with a couple of them.

59:16.126 --> 59:17.767
[SPEAKER_21]: I want to do more collaboration.

59:19.188 --> 59:23.912
[SPEAKER_21]: I've just, well I'll just tell you that the artists I've done work with are NeuroActive.

59:25.914 --> 59:28.816
[SPEAKER_21]: I did a song with, his name's Jarko.

59:30.058 --> 59:31.478
[SPEAKER_21]: and obviously he's not American.

59:33.539 --> 59:43.822
[SPEAKER_21]: I did a song called Fiberoptic Rhythm and he sent me the music over the internet and I wrote the song, sent it back to him and he put it on the album.

59:45.962 --> 59:54.185
[SPEAKER_21]: I haven't really done much collaboration.

59:55.714 --> 59:58.216
[SPEAKER_21]: There's collaboration to be had, I know that.

59:58.497 --> 01:00:06.003
[SPEAKER_21]: I've been speaking with Jeff Pinckney of The Nine, one of my other favorite ADD label artists.

01:00:07.485 --> 01:00:11.969
[SPEAKER_21]: He's actually working with me right now doing some music for my publisher.

01:00:14.551 --> 01:00:18.014
[SPEAKER_21]: Hopefully he and I will be collaborating on some stuff in the future.

01:00:19.249 --> 01:00:19.990
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, cool.

01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:22.651
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do one more question from our chat here.

01:00:22.671 --> 01:00:32.678
[SPEAKER_03]: We have MJB wants to know, are there any other songs in Bomani, which is what we call the music games that Konami puts out, including DDR and BBNA 2DX, etc.

01:00:32.878 --> 01:00:36.121
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there any other songs you've considered remixing in the series?

01:00:36.161 --> 01:00:43.146
[SPEAKER_03]: Has doing this remix you've already done kind of made you want to remix some other songs there in Bomani?

01:00:43.866 --> 01:00:45.027
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, you know, it's

01:00:46.045 --> 01:00:51.346
[SPEAKER_21]: Asking me if I want to remix something is like asking me if I want to wake up in the morning and have breakfast.

01:00:54.266 --> 01:00:55.587
[SPEAKER_21]: It's just a matter of choices.

01:00:55.907 --> 01:00:58.747
[SPEAKER_21]: I've got a whole cabinet full of cereal.

01:00:58.787 --> 01:01:01.548
[SPEAKER_21]: Do I pick the corn checks or the wheat checks?

01:01:05.168 --> 01:01:12.269
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not project-less, so I have my plate fairly full all the time with music projects.

01:01:12.289 --> 01:01:12.990
[SPEAKER_21]: Doing music for...

01:01:15.802 --> 01:01:16.943
[SPEAKER_21]: for television libraries.

01:01:16.963 --> 01:01:17.963
[SPEAKER_21]: It keeps me fairly busy.

01:01:18.183 --> 01:01:19.224
[SPEAKER_21]: Of course, I have my day job.

01:01:19.764 --> 01:01:22.785
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't really go out and seek after remix work.

01:01:23.265 --> 01:01:29.008
[SPEAKER_21]: Remix work, if somebody needs something done, they'll usually ask me now.

01:01:29.128 --> 01:01:30.188
[SPEAKER_21]: I used to have to seek it out.

01:01:30.869 --> 01:01:34.410
[SPEAKER_03]: That's when you know you've made it big time, when they come find you.

01:01:34.430 --> 01:01:36.831
[SPEAKER_21]: When you've made it big time, you've bought your home in Hollywood Hills.

01:01:40.077 --> 01:01:48.064
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, that's going to do it for the questions from our chat, but actually, we wanted to kind of wrap up and go to a song.

01:01:48.084 --> 01:01:49.005
[SPEAKER_03]: We're actually going to play something.

01:01:49.245 --> 01:01:52.508
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't, unfortunately, Middyhead, able to get that song that you sent me over email.

01:01:52.548 --> 01:01:59.634
[SPEAKER_03]: For some reason, my email's not coming up with a new message, so I thought maybe we could play a track from Diving Asunder, I'm sorry, Dividing Asunder, actually.

01:02:00.675 --> 01:02:02.016
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought maybe we could do a song from there.

01:02:02.436 --> 01:02:07.721
[SPEAKER_03]: And, Middyhead, you're actually going to give some of our listeners some free stuff tonight, as I understand it?

01:02:08.785 --> 01:02:13.588
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, actually, we've got a couple of really great prizes to give away.

01:02:15.729 --> 01:02:21.833
[SPEAKER_21]: We've got a deep-sea fishing in the Salt Lake, the Great Salt Lake.

01:02:21.893 --> 01:02:28.357
[SPEAKER_21]: We have some deep-sea carp fishing trips to give away.

01:02:28.377 --> 01:02:31.179
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

01:02:31.947 --> 01:02:34.269
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that was in the email I saw.

01:02:34.609 --> 01:02:38.672
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you sure that wasn't like the Ryan Seacrest show or something?

01:02:39.373 --> 01:02:40.814
[SPEAKER_21]: Ice fishing in Alaska.

01:02:44.276 --> 01:02:50.621
[SPEAKER_21]: Actually, we're going to give away a couple of CDs from Dividing Ascender.

01:02:51.702 --> 01:02:53.583
[SPEAKER_21]: A couple of monolithic CDs, Dividing Ascender.

01:02:54.424 --> 01:03:00.028
[SPEAKER_21]: And if you want, I'll also pick a couple of listeners to...

01:03:02.369 --> 01:03:03.530
[SPEAKER_21]: to get some free downloads.

01:03:06.012 --> 01:03:13.117
[SPEAKER_21]: You can purchase MP3s off of MIDIhead.com as well of my previous albums if you want to get them in electronic format.

01:03:13.417 --> 01:03:15.018
[SPEAKER_03]: And Loki says he's already bought all three.

01:03:15.378 --> 01:03:15.538
[SPEAKER_21]: Yep.

01:03:15.759 --> 01:03:16.539
[SPEAKER_03]: All three albums.

01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:20.422
[SPEAKER_21]: Dude, I appreciate you, man.

01:03:20.682 --> 01:03:21.102
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

01:03:21.283 --> 01:03:21.703
[SPEAKER_03]: No problem.

01:03:24.150 --> 01:03:28.373
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so if you want to win some free stuff, that's all you got to do.

01:03:28.513 --> 01:03:30.655

01:03:43.724 --> 01:03:46.526
[SPEAKER_03]: And it sounds like we might be able to get some downloads for some other folks too.

01:03:46.626 --> 01:03:49.808
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll be contacting those of you guys that win.

01:03:53.991 --> 01:03:55.992
[SPEAKER_03]: Middy Head, thank you so much for being here on the show tonight.

01:03:56.012 --> 01:03:56.733
[SPEAKER_03]: We appreciate it.

01:03:57.493 --> 01:03:58.334
[SPEAKER_21]: You're welcome, guys.

01:03:58.374 --> 01:03:58.974
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a pleasure.

01:03:59.074 --> 01:04:00.315
[SPEAKER_03]: Did anybody else hear in the room?

01:04:00.515 --> 01:04:02.096
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been kind of quiet here in the room.

01:04:02.136 --> 01:04:04.357
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we've just all been kind of... We've been absorbing.

01:04:04.377 --> 01:04:05.598
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, Middy Head's so entertaining.

01:04:05.618 --> 01:04:06.738
[SPEAKER_16]: We're like sponges.

01:04:08.219 --> 01:04:08.940
[SPEAKER_21]: I hear crickets.

01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:10.140
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on over there?

01:04:10.821 --> 01:04:11.061
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no.

01:04:11.441 --> 01:04:13.863
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just mesmerized by your every word.

01:04:14.103 --> 01:04:14.583
[SPEAKER_03]: Fanboys.

01:04:14.983 --> 01:04:17.345
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, that was a safe answer.

01:04:18.665 --> 01:04:18.925
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:04:18.946 --> 01:04:20.226
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we do appreciate you being here.

01:04:20.246 --> 01:04:23.168
[SPEAKER_03]: Wish you the best of luck, and I hope we get to talk to you again in the future, all right?

01:04:23.903 --> 01:04:24.584
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sure you will.

01:04:24.744 --> 01:04:25.085
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:04:25.245 --> 01:04:26.046
[SPEAKER_03]: You take care of yourself.

01:04:26.086 --> 01:04:27.347
[SPEAKER_21]: Have a good night.

01:04:27.588 --> 01:04:29.330
[SPEAKER_21]: My love goes out to everyone listening.

01:04:29.790 --> 01:04:32.073
[SPEAKER_21]: And have a happy holiday, everyone.

01:04:32.253 --> 01:04:32.594
[SPEAKER_03]: You too.

01:04:33.255 --> 01:04:33.555
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks.

01:04:33.715 --> 01:04:34.015
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:04:34.055 --> 01:04:34.496
[SPEAKER_03]: Take care.

01:04:34.516 --> 01:04:34.957
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

01:04:36.604 --> 01:04:37.684
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, that was good.

01:04:38.385 --> 01:04:39.045
[SPEAKER_03]: What a nice guy.

01:04:39.065 --> 01:04:40.045
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome, very cool.

01:04:40.146 --> 01:04:45.488
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to say out there to our listeners, and I'm quoting, he uses acid.

01:04:45.848 --> 01:04:49.229
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm fucking going on every Bomani board and saying he fucking uses acid.

01:04:49.870 --> 01:04:50.550
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck you guys.

01:04:50.810 --> 01:04:52.551
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm entering the damn contest with acid.

01:04:52.991 --> 01:04:56.412
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I was trying to get at when I cut him off.

01:04:56.693 --> 01:05:02.115
[SPEAKER_03]: How rude of me to cut the guy off while I'm interviewing him to make that very point, Loki, that...

01:05:02.873 --> 01:05:05.756
[SPEAKER_03]: The professionals are using acid, so shut up.

01:05:06.576 --> 01:05:08.738
[SPEAKER_03]: And let Loki use acid in the contest, people.

01:05:09.499 --> 01:05:15.724
[SPEAKER_08]: All you have to do is just make a nice little sound clip out of it, post it on the board and say, okay, listen to this, boom.

01:05:16.365 --> 01:05:22.089
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I associate like, you know, like a banner or something, you know, acid is midi head approved.

01:05:22.109 --> 01:05:22.270
Okay.

01:05:25.658 --> 01:05:29.440
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, once again, you guys, free stuff at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:30.261
[SPEAKER_03]: Just send an email.

01:05:30.401 --> 01:05:32.462
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all you have to do, and you might win some free stuff.

01:05:32.902 --> 01:05:34.003
[SPEAKER_03]: Middy Head, great guy.

01:05:34.543 --> 01:05:36.004
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a child of the 80s.

01:05:36.184 --> 01:05:36.925
[SPEAKER_03]: What else can he say?

01:05:37.545 --> 01:05:38.366
[SPEAKER_08]: Can't complain about that.

01:05:39.006 --> 01:05:40.747
[SPEAKER_08]: He's a man after my own heart.

01:05:40.787 --> 01:05:41.868
[SPEAKER_08]: The whole dissent thing.

01:05:42.765 --> 01:05:44.946
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, oh my god, I used to play that when I was a kid.

01:05:45.006 --> 01:05:46.947
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to have to invite him out for drinks at E3.

01:05:47.127 --> 01:05:47.648
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

01:05:47.688 --> 01:05:48.168
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

01:05:48.248 --> 01:05:49.589
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope he can make it.

01:05:49.689 --> 01:05:50.009
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:05:50.249 --> 01:05:51.350
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, let's check out.

01:05:51.590 --> 01:05:54.892
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's stop gushing for a minute here and let's hear some music.

01:05:54.912 --> 01:05:58.173
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to hear a track from the CD we're giving away tonight, Dividing Asunder.

01:05:58.593 --> 01:06:03.556
[SPEAKER_03]: This song is called Lulling Us to Sleep, which this show sometimes does to people, but not tonight.

01:06:03.596 --> 01:06:04.136
[SPEAKER_03]: Not tonight.

01:06:04.156 --> 01:06:08.699
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to hear this track and we will be right back with more Orange Lounge Radio.

01:06:19.908 --> 01:06:21.350
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching!

01:06:54.051 --> 01:07:17.831
[SPEAKER_11]: We are walking in our sleep And though our eyes are open Our slumber is so deep We rinse our souls with tearful face Our hypnotist has spoken The lullaby we sing

01:08:26.571 --> 01:08:29.014
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry guys, we're having some technical difficulties there.

01:08:29.575 --> 01:08:32.418
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, Bad Me, that song is rocking too.

01:08:32.478 --> 01:08:33.078
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry guys.

01:08:33.319 --> 01:08:34.099
[SPEAKER_04]: Say it again.

01:08:34.420 --> 01:08:37.703
[SPEAKER_03]: Internet radio is broke, left and right.

01:08:37.743 --> 01:08:38.424
[SPEAKER_03]: What can I say?

01:08:38.584 --> 01:08:40.266
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on, let's try this again.

01:08:40.687 --> 01:08:42.068
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that was my question also.

01:08:42.148 --> 01:08:43.149
[SPEAKER_04]: Is MidiHead singing it?

01:08:43.329 --> 01:08:44.671
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so.

01:08:44.771 --> 01:08:45.272
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure.

01:08:45.492 --> 01:08:46.052
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry guys.

01:09:28.260 --> 01:09:29.101
Thanks for watching!

01:10:21.564 --> 01:10:22.988
Thank you for watching!

01:10:45.733 --> 01:10:47.358
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching!

01:11:55.035 --> 01:11:55.796
Thanks for watching!

01:12:13.379 --> 01:12:21.987
[SPEAKER_20]: Hiho, Kermit the VOG here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.

01:12:22.027 --> 01:12:27.792
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

01:12:28.231 --> 01:12:28.791
[SPEAKER_03]: We are back here.

01:12:28.891 --> 01:12:30.332
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry for the technical difficulties there.

01:12:30.752 --> 01:12:32.033
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, you know, internet radio.

01:12:32.873 --> 01:12:33.353
[SPEAKER_03]: What can you say?

01:12:34.254 --> 01:12:37.095
[SPEAKER_03]: Monolithic, Lulling Us to Sleep, awesome song.

01:12:37.135 --> 01:12:39.216
[SPEAKER_03]: It's getting a great response in the chat room there.

01:12:40.076 --> 01:12:41.377
[SPEAKER_03]: This song is kicking ass.

01:12:41.857 --> 01:12:43.238
[SPEAKER_03]: This song is fucking hot.

01:12:43.638 --> 01:12:45.199
[SPEAKER_03]: Midi Head is the shit, etc., etc.

01:12:45.919 --> 01:12:49.200
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure MidiHead is happy to know that he's got plenty of new fanboys and girls there.

01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:52.022
[SPEAKER_03]: And just being such a nice guy, especially there on the interview there.

01:12:52.042 --> 01:12:53.622
[SPEAKER_03]: So thanks again to MidiHead for being on the program.

[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, one email per person, please.

01:13:07.008 --> 01:13:07.288
[SPEAKER_03]: Grr.

01:13:08.564 --> 01:13:08.844
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't cheat.

01:13:08.864 --> 01:13:09.424
[SPEAKER_03]: Cheaters don't prosper.

01:13:09.444 --> 01:13:10.045
[SPEAKER_03]: People should know this by now.

01:13:10.065 --> 01:13:10.725
[SPEAKER_03]: If you cheat, you don't win.

01:13:10.745 --> 01:13:10.865
[SPEAKER_03]: Period.

01:13:10.885 --> 01:13:11.065
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

01:13:11.085 --> 01:13:12.686
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of winning, we have another giveaway that's still going on.

01:13:43.089 --> 01:13:44.530
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, boys and girls.

01:13:44.670 --> 01:13:51.793
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time to conclude our signed Akira Yamaoka CD giveaway that's been going on the station for the past two weeks.

01:13:52.494 --> 01:13:56.236
[SPEAKER_03]: Jazz was our lucky winner last week of an autographed Akira Yamaoka CD.

01:13:56.776 --> 01:13:58.176
[SPEAKER_03]: Minidisc, Silent Hill 4.

01:13:58.497 --> 01:14:00.057
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys have been listening throughout the week.

01:14:00.498 --> 01:14:06.560
[SPEAKER_03]: Monday nights, Diversion, the Orange Launch Radio Remix show, where remixes and acid are A-OK by us.

01:14:08.383 --> 01:14:14.509
[SPEAKER_03]: and Tuesday nights to DarkSakura and her lovely program, Pump Up the Volume, and Thursday nights to Outside the Box.

01:14:14.569 --> 01:14:18.874
[SPEAKER_03]: And now, we're going to find ourselves a winner for the second signed Akira Yamaoka CD.

01:14:18.894 --> 01:14:21.376
[SPEAKER_20]: We're giving away so much free stuff tonight, I can't handle it.

01:14:22.377 --> 01:14:23.678
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Loki, find us a winner.

01:14:26.661 --> 01:14:27.162
[SPEAKER_03]: Who is it?

01:14:29.404 --> 01:14:32.067
[SPEAKER_03]: The winner is Dork!

01:14:33.581 --> 01:14:35.383
[SPEAKER_03]: Akira Yamaoka Signs CD

01:14:56.312 --> 01:14:57.453
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

01:15:21.363 --> 01:15:21.863
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

01:15:22.584 --> 01:15:23.825
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on with the program.

01:15:23.885 --> 01:15:25.646
[SPEAKER_03]: Gosh, where do we begin?

01:15:25.726 --> 01:15:27.247
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do we go?

01:15:28.047 --> 01:15:28.388
[SPEAKER_03]: News?

01:15:28.708 --> 01:15:29.848
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on in the news world?

01:15:29.868 --> 01:15:31.289
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on in the sim scene, Loki?

01:15:31.329 --> 01:15:35.332
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there's stuff going on in the sim world right now, in the worlds of DDR simulation.

01:15:35.952 --> 01:15:36.493
[SPEAKER_03]: He's thinking.

01:15:36.613 --> 01:15:37.734
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anything going on this week?

01:15:38.534 --> 01:15:39.455
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really, no.

01:15:41.096 --> 01:15:42.236
[SPEAKER_04]: Not at all, actually.

01:15:44.011 --> 01:15:46.373
[SPEAKER_04]: And how the, no, no, no, no, nothing.

01:15:46.533 --> 01:15:48.495
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I guess one little thing to mention.

01:15:49.035 --> 01:15:57.382
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, Bomani Style, post-sending, if you guys are Guitar Freaks, Drum Mania fans, they have the sim files for, um, Guitar Freaks, I think, 1 through 10.

01:15:58.203 --> 01:16:00.244
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can get those in their media shop there.

01:16:00.465 --> 01:16:03.407
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's, you know, it's got all your, uh, GDA files for, um,

01:16:04.262 --> 01:16:08.243
[SPEAKER_04]: DTX Mania which is a sim and those type of things.

01:16:08.483 --> 01:16:25.628
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you want more information, first off, download the sims in the media shop on BomayiStyle and check out their session simulation forums on BomayiStyle as well for all your information on how to actually use those sim files and play around with them.

01:16:26.228 --> 01:16:26.788
[SPEAKER_04]: They're a lot of fun.

01:16:28.269 --> 01:16:29.209
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, very cool.

01:16:30.378 --> 01:16:32.479
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a news story that's in right now.

01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:38.363
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't really necessarily relate to DDR completely, but I thought it was interesting because there's some games in here that are definitely worth mentioning.

01:16:38.843 --> 01:16:41.864
[SPEAKER_03]: Time Magazine has announced their top ten video games of the year.

01:16:41.885 --> 01:16:43.205
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys ready to hear this?

01:16:43.225 --> 01:16:44.826
[SPEAKER_03]: The top ten video... Uh-oh.

01:16:45.867 --> 01:16:46.787
[SPEAKER_03]: And sorry, guys.

01:16:47.147 --> 01:16:48.968
[SPEAKER_03]: DDR, not on it.

01:16:49.288 --> 01:16:50.329
[SPEAKER_03]: Karaoke, not on it.

01:16:50.809 --> 01:16:51.890
[SPEAKER_03]: Bomani, not on it.

01:16:52.030 --> 01:16:54.571
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Karaoke Revolution did win it last year, if I remember right.

01:16:54.611 --> 01:16:57.633
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I guess it's Bomani's turn to take a back...

01:16:58.410 --> 01:16:58.630
[SPEAKER_03]: Pirates

01:17:22.396 --> 01:17:23.658
[SPEAKER_03]: Army D, it's Pirates.

01:17:23.998 --> 01:17:24.999
What is that?

01:17:25.059 --> 01:17:27.202
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an adventure RPG game, and I believe it's on the PC.

01:17:27.222 --> 01:17:28.042
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think so.

01:17:29.504 --> 01:17:29.904
[SPEAKER_03]: Pirates.

01:17:30.045 --> 01:17:30.265
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

01:17:30.285 --> 01:17:31.967
[SPEAKER_03]: Not to be confused with Puzzle Pirates.

01:17:32.127 --> 01:17:35.010
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, not to be confused with Puzzle Pirates.

01:17:35.070 --> 01:17:39.615
[SPEAKER_03]: Number nine, Fable for the Xbox, that role-playing game.

01:17:39.635 --> 01:17:42.718
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the one where you can marry a guy in it, if you play the cards right.

01:17:43.999 --> 01:17:44.460
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty awesome.

01:17:45.253 --> 01:17:50.557
[SPEAKER_03]: Number 8, Burnout 3, Takedown, another racing and crashing game.

01:17:50.617 --> 01:17:52.418
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki's giving the thumbs up to that, any particular reason?

01:17:53.058 --> 01:17:56.620
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the first one was awesome, and this one looked really good, but I just have no interest in buying games.

01:17:58.722 --> 01:18:05.046
[SPEAKER_03]: Number 7, and I'm actually surprised it's kind of low because everybody in the gaming community has a huge boner about Halo 2.

01:18:05.899 --> 01:18:08.301
[SPEAKER_08]: Battlefield Vietnam, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas

01:18:31.858 --> 01:18:34.421
[SPEAKER_03]: If you haven't heard about Grand Theft Auto, it's time to come out of your hole.

01:18:53.028 --> 01:18:56.289
[SPEAKER_03]: So what rolled over Grand Theft Auto to land in fourth place?

01:18:56.670 --> 01:18:57.950
[SPEAKER_03]: Katamari Damacy.

01:18:58.070 --> 01:18:59.531
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay!

01:18:59.791 --> 01:19:01.891
[SPEAKER_03]: Number four, I know there's a lot of folks in here.

01:19:01.911 --> 01:19:03.792
[SPEAKER_08]: Best underground hit ever.

01:19:04.112 --> 01:19:08.554
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, it's the sleeper hit probably so far this decade.

01:19:08.754 --> 01:19:11.195
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, it's the biggest sleeper hit I've ever seen.

01:19:12.475 --> 01:19:15.076
[SPEAKER_03]: Number three, a little game you might have heard of.

01:19:15.558 --> 01:19:16.058
[SPEAKER_03]: Half-Life 2.

01:19:17.179 --> 01:19:18.480
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you guys know the Half-Life.

01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:19.501
[SPEAKER_03]: You ever heard of Half-Life?

01:19:19.721 --> 01:19:22.023
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think so.

01:19:22.103 --> 01:19:23.484
[SPEAKER_08]: A long time ago, yeah.

01:19:24.124 --> 01:19:30.729
[SPEAKER_03]: Number two, and always in magazines, there are these games that kind of come out of nowhere to land at number two.

01:19:31.170 --> 01:19:35.793
[SPEAKER_03]: And in this case, it's a strategy game, and I'm sure strategy gamers out there are going to go, Sky, you idiot!

01:19:37.274 --> 01:19:40.917
[SPEAKER_03]: Rome Total War is the name of the game.

01:19:40.977 --> 01:19:41.578
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never heard of it.

01:19:41.798 --> 01:19:42.518
[SPEAKER_03]: Cricket.

01:19:42.558 --> 01:19:43.019
[SPEAKER_03]: Cricket, Cricket.

01:19:43.039 --> 01:19:43.279
[SPEAKER_08]: Cricket.

01:19:44.288 --> 01:19:45.369
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys are idiots!

01:19:46.450 --> 01:19:48.091
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you mean you don't play strategy games?

01:19:48.111 --> 01:19:49.372
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the best strategy game ever.

01:19:49.693 --> 01:19:51.774
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so glad I don't have headphones right now.

01:19:51.794 --> 01:19:53.295
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds so lame.

01:19:54.376 --> 01:19:55.317
[SPEAKER_04]: Rome Total War.

01:19:55.417 --> 01:19:55.577
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey!

01:19:55.597 --> 01:19:59.740
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait a second, wasn't that that stupid game that Capcom was pushing or something?

01:19:59.941 --> 01:20:06.566
[SPEAKER_04]: That was like some sort of, almost like Melgar Solid in Greek Roman times, you know?

01:20:07.847 --> 01:20:08.948
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that the game?

01:20:08.988 --> 01:20:10.809
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that one looked really lame.

01:20:10.849 --> 01:20:13.071
[SPEAKER_04]: And every time I saw it on their big screen, I'd laugh at it.

01:20:15.463 --> 01:20:17.465
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, you want to know what the number one game of the year is?

01:20:17.485 --> 01:20:19.326
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, wait, I have to interrupt you real quick.

01:20:19.346 --> 01:20:19.566
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

01:20:19.947 --> 01:20:21.708
[SPEAKER_08]: MidiHead has joined us in our chat room.

01:20:22.008 --> 01:20:22.469
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

01:20:22.629 --> 01:20:23.950
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

01:20:25.151 --> 01:20:25.791
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

01:20:25.851 --> 01:20:27.973
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, welcome, MidiHead, to join in the chat there.

01:20:28.893 --> 01:20:32.716
[SPEAKER_03]: Go give him the same praise you were giving earlier while that song was playing, honestly.

01:20:32.756 --> 01:20:34.718
[SPEAKER_03]: Inflate his ego a little more, please.

01:20:35.378 --> 01:20:37.900
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure we'll send you a check for that.

01:20:38.781 --> 01:20:40.562
[SPEAKER_03]: You can send us a check for that later.

01:20:40.642 --> 01:20:40.782
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:44.120
[SPEAKER_03]: Number one.

01:20:44.420 --> 01:20:46.521
[SPEAKER_03]: The number one game of the year according to Time Magazine.

01:20:46.681 --> 01:20:49.042
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think Loki could possibly agree with this one.

01:20:49.062 --> 01:20:49.582
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure.

01:20:49.662 --> 01:20:52.342
[SPEAKER_03]: Based on the murder simulation he has created in.

01:20:52.382 --> 01:20:53.043
[SPEAKER_03]: The Sims 2.

01:20:53.223 --> 01:20:58.924
[SPEAKER_06]: That I'll actually give the number one rating to because at E3 that just was phenomenal.

01:20:59.264 --> 01:21:00.485
[SPEAKER_04]: What is coming out for The Sims 2?

01:21:00.785 --> 01:21:05.626
[SPEAKER_04]: But not only the first expansion pack where The Sims go to college.

01:21:07.166 --> 01:21:08.227
[SPEAKER_04]: I kid you not.

01:21:08.287 --> 01:21:09.227
[SPEAKER_04]: They go to college.

01:21:09.447 --> 01:21:11.428
[SPEAKER_04]: They join in on spring break.

01:21:11.588 --> 01:21:12.308
[SPEAKER_04]: Frat parties.

01:21:12.628 --> 01:21:12.988
[SPEAKER_04]: It is

01:21:14.335 --> 01:21:14.635
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

01:21:14.675 --> 01:21:17.439
[SPEAKER_04]: Sims 2 going to school.

01:21:19.762 --> 01:21:21.304
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we get to get Sims drunk now?

01:21:22.225 --> 01:21:25.709
[SPEAKER_03]: I just... How many expansion packs are they going to make for this Sims game, honestly?

01:21:25.809 --> 01:21:31.336
[SPEAKER_06]: How many did they do for... I'm waiting for like the adult Ed Powers version.

01:21:31.997 --> 01:21:32.818
[SPEAKER_06]: The hardcore...

01:21:35.219 --> 01:21:40.323
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that'd be Playboy, the mansion game, you know, where you manage the Playboy mansion.

01:21:40.343 --> 01:21:41.123
[SPEAKER_04]: That looks horrible.

01:21:41.263 --> 01:21:45.647
[SPEAKER_04]: And just, like, watch chicks run around naked that are, like, stupid looking.

01:21:46.167 --> 01:21:53.692
[SPEAKER_04]: That's about as fun as Leisure Suit Larry, the new one, which I beat, and I gotta say, it was kind of lame.

01:21:54.273 --> 01:21:55.114
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kind of lame.

01:21:56.394 --> 01:21:58.716
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, was it at least enjoyable?

01:21:59.937 --> 01:22:02.479
[SPEAKER_04]: It was enjoyable after I took the censorship off.

01:22:05.476 --> 01:22:13.841
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to love any game, though, that allows you to be a sperm trying to make it through, you know, and avoiding, you know, different blocks to try to make it through the egg.

01:22:14.382 --> 01:22:15.022
[SPEAKER_06]: That was pretty funny.

01:22:15.222 --> 01:22:19.085
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

01:22:19.265 --> 01:22:23.388
[SPEAKER_03]: Any overlooked games, you guys think, for the top ten of the year?

01:22:24.268 --> 01:22:25.689
[SPEAKER_06]: Besides Ultramix 2.

01:22:26.670 --> 01:22:32.434
[SPEAKER_06]: God, you know, it's good Katamari made it because otherwise I would have been like, what?! !

01:22:33.726 --> 01:22:36.408
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Metal Gear Solid 3.

01:22:37.969 --> 01:22:39.930
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm actually a little bit surprised.

01:22:41.051 --> 01:22:46.354
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm wondering if it was because the release date was so late that something such as Smackdown vs. Raw wouldn't have made it.

01:22:46.874 --> 01:22:49.456
[SPEAKER_08]: Just because, I mean, it's amazing.

01:22:49.576 --> 01:22:51.077
[SPEAKER_08]: It is utterly amazing.

01:22:51.257 --> 01:22:51.677
[SPEAKER_08]: F that!

01:22:51.757 --> 01:22:52.718
[SPEAKER_25]: Rumble Roses!

01:22:52.858 --> 01:22:54.259
[SPEAKER_25]: Where's my Rumble Roses?

01:22:55.220 --> 01:22:58.522
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but you have to admit that the playthrough mode, the...

01:22:59.342 --> 01:23:27.995
[SPEAKER_04]: The Story Mode Oh my god, that's horrible Even Sigurd agrees with me in chat there Rumble Roses was far overlooked It was, but that, you know The Story Mode is just Although the game is getting horrible reviews Oh come on Oh sure, they give, you know, DOA Beach Volleyball good reviews But no, this one actually has gameplay Oh, it's interrupting my watching them walk around Dammit I actually have to play this one?

01:23:28.795 --> 01:23:29.495
[SPEAKER_06]: That sucks!

01:23:29.796 --> 01:23:31.516
[SPEAKER_06]: It's interrupting the jiggle scenes, dammit.

01:23:31.957 --> 01:23:38.280
[SPEAKER_04]: They should have DOA versus Rumble Roses and just like one all-naked-fest mud-wrestling game.

01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:38.920
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

01:23:39.060 --> 01:23:39.580
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

01:23:39.740 --> 01:23:40.621
[SPEAKER_04]: I totally agree.

01:23:40.861 --> 01:23:45.423
[SPEAKER_08]: Not enough nakedness in games, I guess.

01:23:45.503 --> 01:23:46.343
[SPEAKER_06]: Where was the guy game?

01:23:48.689 --> 01:23:50.210
[SPEAKER_03]: I have never played the guy game.

01:23:50.230 --> 01:23:51.331
[SPEAKER_03]: I've only heard about this game.

01:23:51.351 --> 01:23:52.251
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you played the guy game?

01:23:52.271 --> 01:23:54.153
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I have to admit, I did rent it.

01:23:54.553 --> 01:23:55.934
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell is up with the guy game?

01:23:55.954 --> 01:23:57.035
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell me about the guy game.

01:23:57.315 --> 01:24:05.880
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, the guy game was apparently filmed spring break last year at some place in Texas where they were just basically asking women trivia questions.

01:24:05.980 --> 01:24:07.742
[SPEAKER_06]: And these women are dumb as rocks.

01:24:08.802 --> 01:24:09.663
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, let's be honest here.

01:24:10.563 --> 01:24:16.047
[SPEAKER_06]: And the first part of the game is to see which one of the four players will get it right.

01:24:16.147 --> 01:24:17.528
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the second part is

01:24:18.447 --> 01:24:20.508
[SPEAKER_06]: to figure out if the girl's going to get it right.

01:24:21.109 --> 01:24:25.251
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you figure that she's going to get it right or wrong... Well, the girl's never going to get it right!

01:24:25.391 --> 01:24:26.192
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kidding, I'm kidding.

01:24:26.372 --> 01:24:28.313
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, there's a few that actually do, and it's kind of scary.

01:24:28.333 --> 01:24:28.933
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

01:24:28.953 --> 01:24:31.315
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't that stolen from Howard Stern?

01:24:31.955 --> 01:24:33.336
[SPEAKER_04]: Or like some other talk show?

01:24:33.356 --> 01:24:36.918
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I know this has been stolen on numerous talk shows.

01:24:36.958 --> 01:24:43.902
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it obviously has, but there's this little meter that goes up, and at first it starts off, you know, if they get it wrong, they have to flash their tits.

01:24:44.383 --> 01:24:46.384
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it first starts off... Jesus Christ!

01:24:47.134 --> 01:24:52.916
[SPEAKER_06]: So it first starts off with them flashing and it has the guy game logo across their chest.

01:24:53.456 --> 01:24:59.318
[SPEAKER_06]: You get the level up a little bit higher and all of a sudden the logo disappears but their boobies are pixelated.

01:25:00.018 --> 01:25:00.838
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's kind of fuzzy.

01:25:01.298 --> 01:25:04.199
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you get to the last level where it's totally uncensored.

01:25:05.559 --> 01:25:11.321
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can replay the level and see all these girls topless and it's just kind of

01:25:12.685 --> 01:25:16.767
[SPEAKER_06]: Head Scratching, you know, mind-boggling, just what the hell are they thinking?

01:25:16.787 --> 01:25:18.448
[SPEAKER_04]: Like BMX XXX?

01:25:19.128 --> 01:25:23.430
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I have that game, and I can't play it because it gives me, like, motion sickness.

01:25:23.950 --> 01:25:24.771
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that game.

01:25:25.531 --> 01:25:27.732
[SPEAKER_04]: And the movies are awesome in it.

01:25:27.792 --> 01:25:29.333
[SPEAKER_04]: The final movies kick ass.

01:25:29.353 --> 01:25:30.253
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I have to admit that.

01:25:30.293 --> 01:25:32.234
[SPEAKER_04]: Asian schoolgirl stripping.

01:25:34.615 --> 01:25:37.177
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm surprised that this game isn't still number one today.

01:25:39.230 --> 01:25:40.092
[SPEAKER_06]: But no, the guy game.

01:25:40.193 --> 01:25:40.714
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my goodness.

01:25:40.754 --> 01:25:41.777
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I'm shocked.

01:25:41.837 --> 01:25:44.243
[SPEAKER_03]: The guy game is not the number one game of the year.

01:25:44.523 --> 01:25:45.225
[SPEAKER_03]: So, shocked.

01:25:48.576 --> 01:25:50.697
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, I think now's a good time to call it a break.

01:25:51.057 --> 01:25:51.457
[SPEAKER_03]: Go on, girl.

01:25:51.477 --> 01:25:55.838
[SPEAKER_03]: I notice you're purposefully quiet over there during discussions with the guy game.

01:25:56.158 --> 01:25:58.038
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just telling Middyhead goodbye.

01:25:58.638 --> 01:25:59.139
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, he left?

01:25:59.159 --> 01:26:00.079
[SPEAKER_03]: He took off?

01:26:00.099 --> 01:26:01.379
[SPEAKER_03]: Did our chat room scare him off?

01:26:01.539 --> 01:26:04.400
[SPEAKER_08]: I was being all nice to your guests and everything.

01:26:04.940 --> 01:26:11.522
[SPEAKER_03]: All I know is I looked in the chat room and somebody said that they were jizzing their pants when they listened to the Middyhead song and I'm just like, I better not read anymore.

01:26:12.942 --> 01:26:14.322
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, I better not read anymore.

01:26:15.703 --> 01:26:16.623
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I love our listeners.

01:26:16.803 --> 01:26:17.223
[SPEAKER_03]: They're great.

01:26:17.557 --> 01:26:17.977

[SPEAKER_03]: Find out when we come back.

01:27:13.251 --> 01:27:14.812
[SPEAKER_03]: 2DX11 music coming your way.

01:27:15.112 --> 01:27:15.553
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be back.

01:27:15.653 --> 01:27:16.834
[SPEAKER_03]: Or 2DX Red, I should say.

01:27:17.955 --> 01:27:18.535
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, fanboys.

01:27:43.886 --> 01:27:44.366
Thanks for watching!

[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio With the Ping Pong Ball

01:33:52.119 --> 01:33:54.520
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, Middy had actually sent me an email during the break there.

01:33:54.820 --> 01:33:58.162
[SPEAKER_03]: And he wants you guys to know that, yes, that was him singing in that song.

01:33:58.242 --> 01:33:59.003
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, wow.

01:33:59.023 --> 01:34:01.604
[SPEAKER_03]: For those of you guys that wanted to know if that was his voice, yes, that was him singing.

01:34:02.064 --> 01:34:02.865
[SPEAKER_03]: Very impressed.

01:34:02.965 --> 01:34:05.766
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's sending me a new song of his to play.

01:34:05.906 --> 01:34:06.647
[SPEAKER_16]: Very cool.

01:34:06.847 --> 01:34:08.908
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll be playing that at the end of the show.

01:34:08.928 --> 01:34:09.588
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking forward to that.

01:34:09.848 --> 01:34:12.289

[SPEAKER_03]: You get second helpings.

01:34:19.446 --> 01:34:28.268
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks to DDR Freak Radio, who's going to be rebroadcasting it on December 10th, 6 o'clock, as they do every Friday night, our little show over there.

01:34:28.508 --> 01:34:30.029
[SPEAKER_08]: Orange Lounge Radio Rewind.

01:34:30.149 --> 01:34:31.649
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, so, very cool.

01:34:31.689 --> 01:34:37.330
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, some of you guys may be thinking, well, didn't you guys used to do the rewinds on your own damn station, Sky?

01:34:37.991 --> 01:34:44.352
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, actually, that's true, but now it is the oldie and moldie Wednesday flashback, where we are 100 episodes behind right now.

01:34:44.392 --> 01:34:46.173
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can hear what the show sounded like two years ago.

01:34:46.733 --> 01:34:47.393
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty nuts.

01:34:47.413 --> 01:34:47.493
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

01:34:48.713 --> 01:34:58.819
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of looked at the chat and some of the response to last week's episode, and I think Misty or somebody had said, it's a good thing I wasn't there, because I would have ripped him a new asshole.

01:34:59.179 --> 01:35:06.003
[SPEAKER_03]: So hear what offensive things you missed out on, back on episodes 20 and 21 and all that stuff we're playing way back when, so check it out.

01:35:07.463 --> 01:35:09.164
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so we're going to get to our...

01:35:11.164 --> 01:35:14.088
[SPEAKER_03]: are not a cage match, but something a little different in a little bit.

01:35:14.368 --> 01:35:17.192
[SPEAKER_03]: But I wanted to talk first about Taiko Drum Master.

01:35:17.793 --> 01:35:20.216
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a game that kind of came out there under our noses.

01:35:20.256 --> 01:35:23.120
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we got to check it out at E3, and we told you guys a little bit about it.

01:35:23.959 --> 01:35:26.861
[SPEAKER_03]: Huge game in Japan called Taiko no Tachijin in Japan.

01:35:27.502 --> 01:35:30.524
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, for those who don't know what it's about, it's about Taiko drumming.

01:35:30.824 --> 01:35:34.087
[SPEAKER_03]: You have these big things that look like breadsticks, and you beat the drum.

01:35:34.147 --> 01:35:35.788
[SPEAKER_03]: Either you beat it in the center or you beat it in the side.

01:35:36.249 --> 01:35:43.014
[SPEAKER_03]: And so popular in Japan, it was the number one selling game in Japan for a while, that they decided to bring it over to the U.S., call it Taiko Drum Master.

01:35:43.414 --> 01:35:45.756
[SPEAKER_03]: And Iguana Girl, you guys actually picked up a copy of it, right?

01:35:45.936 --> 01:35:49.920
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, we purchased a copy over at our local Fry's Electronics for 60 bucks.

01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:51.041
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

01:36:07.270 --> 01:36:08.011
[SPEAKER_08]: Na, na, na, na, na, na

01:36:25.607 --> 01:36:26.167
[SPEAKER_02]: and so on.

01:36:51.388 --> 01:37:00.093
[SPEAKER_03]: by the way, I just want to talk about how scary it was that we all burst into song on the Katamari Damashii record a little bit scary there the song is a stroke of genius

01:37:06.861 --> 01:37:10.123
[SPEAKER_08]: Those were some songs that we actually got to play at E3.

01:37:11.304 --> 01:37:16.067
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, that was on the Taika No Tatooine original setup.

01:37:16.507 --> 01:37:18.448
[SPEAKER_08]: But it was more like the crossover.

01:37:18.628 --> 01:37:20.830
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the E3 version of the American game.

01:37:22.331 --> 01:37:23.911
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, the music list is pretty decent.

01:37:25.252 --> 01:37:27.033
[SPEAKER_08]: We've only managed to get 31 songs.

01:37:27.073 --> 01:37:28.214
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if there's further.

01:37:28.594 --> 01:37:29.535
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's the max.

01:37:29.595 --> 01:37:31.356
[SPEAKER_08]: We have unlocked the Oni mode.

01:37:32.056 --> 01:37:32.596
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Oni Mode.

01:37:32.656 --> 01:37:33.477
[SPEAKER_03]: It is Oni Mode.

01:37:33.517 --> 01:37:42.341
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I have to ask, or else Rice Princess and Lanky Style would kill me because this is an inside joke from outside the box, but My Sharona is in the game, correct?

01:37:42.621 --> 01:37:42.881
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

01:37:43.421 --> 01:37:44.562
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, just double check.

01:37:44.642 --> 01:37:45.602
[SPEAKER_03]: It is in the game.

01:37:45.682 --> 01:37:46.642
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

01:37:46.823 --> 01:37:50.264
[SPEAKER_08]: There's also, wasn't Love Shack in that?

01:37:50.424 --> 01:37:50.624
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

01:37:50.684 --> 01:37:52.125
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

01:37:52.145 --> 01:37:53.766
[SPEAKER_08]: Love Shack is also in that game.

01:37:53.986 --> 01:37:54.706
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that song.

01:37:54.926 --> 01:37:55.666
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

01:37:55.806 --> 01:37:56.046
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

01:37:56.067 --> 01:37:57.047
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

01:37:57.876 --> 01:37:59.137
[SPEAKER_08]: Stuff like ABC.

01:37:59.558 --> 01:38:00.579
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you going to be my girl?

01:38:00.779 --> 01:38:01.880
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's Ross' favorite.

01:38:01.900 --> 01:38:03.521
[SPEAKER_06]: That one's a lot of fun.

01:38:03.561 --> 01:38:04.202
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of fun.

01:38:08.129 --> 01:38:10.651
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a Queen song in there, Killer Queen.

01:38:10.671 --> 01:38:17.698
[SPEAKER_06]: There's all sorts of songs from Namco's own games, like the theme song from Soul Calibur, Ridge Racer.

01:38:17.738 --> 01:38:23.042
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember that the Soul Calibur song, whatever it's called, was one of the stages.

01:38:23.303 --> 01:38:25.925
[SPEAKER_03]: Brave Sword, Braver Soul, yeah, whatever.

01:38:26.065 --> 01:38:26.646
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's cool.

01:38:26.766 --> 01:38:29.448
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, it's a good overall mix of music.

01:38:29.488 --> 01:38:32.871
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, they've got a lot of American songs mixed in with...

01:38:34.993 --> 01:38:39.298
[SPEAKER_08]: Mixed in with the classical stuff and with their own versions of stuff.

01:38:39.318 --> 01:38:42.421
[SPEAKER_08]: Like they have Taiko March and stuff like that.

01:38:42.501 --> 01:38:48.246
[SPEAKER_03]: So do you think that the kids that are upset that there's been no US Beatmania as of yet, do you think that this might hold them over a little bit?

01:38:50.108 --> 01:38:50.789
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe.

01:38:51.710 --> 01:38:53.031
[SPEAKER_08]: It's more like the...

01:38:55.379 --> 01:39:00.183
[SPEAKER_08]: If you were to get this and Donkey Konga, then you've got your whole drum mania thing worked out right there.

01:39:00.203 --> 01:39:01.705
[SPEAKER_03]: This is more like a drum mania.

01:39:02.145 --> 01:39:11.374
[SPEAKER_08]: That's another ironic bit is that the classical stuff that is in Donkey Konga is the same stuff that's in Taiko Drum Masters.

01:39:11.474 --> 01:39:17.339
[SPEAKER_08]: So you could either choose to play the stuff on the bongos or on the Taiko drums.

01:39:18.260 --> 01:39:19.541
[SPEAKER_03]: Just all up to you.

01:39:19.621 --> 01:39:20.582
[SPEAKER_03]: Something for everyone.

01:39:21.082 --> 01:39:24.944
[SPEAKER_03]: Except Katamari on the rocks is not in Donkey Kong.

01:39:24.964 --> 01:39:25.604
[SPEAKER_03]: That's too bad.

01:39:26.304 --> 01:39:26.625
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:39:27.385 --> 01:39:28.145
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, guys.

01:39:28.485 --> 01:39:30.126
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have everything set up over here that we need?

01:39:31.367 --> 01:39:31.667
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki?

01:39:32.007 --> 01:39:32.627
[SPEAKER_03]: Is something wrong?

01:39:36.049 --> 01:39:37.349
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, he's saying the webcam.

01:39:37.369 --> 01:39:38.710
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care about the webcam.

01:39:38.750 --> 01:39:39.850
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got to get the other stuff, though.

01:39:40.511 --> 01:39:43.472
[SPEAKER_03]: We are going to get to tonight's cage match, boys and girls.

01:39:43.592 --> 01:39:45.853
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time for your favorite segment of the show.

01:39:45.913 --> 01:39:48.134
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, maybe not, but it is the mandatory segment we do every week.

01:39:49.804 --> 01:39:59.409
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Cage Match, where we pitch three songs against each other, head-to-head, and we see who the winner is.

01:39:59.569 --> 01:40:09.775
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys vote, and your favorite song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's 24-hour-a-day, 7-days-a-week, Bomani Music and More program.

01:40:10.275 --> 01:40:15.178
[SPEAKER_03]: So, let's see, last week's winner was a little song here.

01:40:15.638 --> 01:40:19.280
[SPEAKER_03]: It was actually a Top 40 song that's won the contest for a couple weeks now.

01:40:20.157 --> 01:40:21.578
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been winning for a little while now.

01:40:22.139 --> 01:40:26.963
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's called... It's by Gwen Stefani.

01:40:28.064 --> 01:40:33.529
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm trying to... Yep, What You Waiting For is the song.

01:40:33.869 --> 01:40:37.052
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a clip of last week's winner, What You Waiting For.

01:40:57.250 --> 01:40:58.371
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that was enough of a clip.

01:40:59.753 --> 01:41:05.761
[SPEAKER_03]: So, the question is, do we do another cage match tonight without DarkSakura present?

01:41:07.102 --> 01:41:09.264
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, a standard normal cage match.

01:41:09.484 --> 01:41:13.066
[SPEAKER_03]: No, unfortunately, we will not be doing a normal cage match tonight.

01:41:13.247 --> 01:41:15.448
[SPEAKER_03]: So Gwen Stefani wins another week by default.

01:41:15.728 --> 01:41:19.051
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if we did a cage match without DarkSakura, there'd be hell to pay.

01:41:20.152 --> 01:41:23.694
[SPEAKER_25]: There'll be hell to pay.

01:41:23.714 --> 01:41:24.835
[SPEAKER_03]: There'll be other hell to pay.

01:41:25.055 --> 01:41:28.778
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead of pissing off Jamie, we're going to piss off Loki.

01:41:28.818 --> 01:41:30.219
[SPEAKER_03]: Because pissing off Loki is funnier.

01:41:32.701 --> 01:41:35.283
[SPEAKER_03]: By doing a... Drumroll, please.

01:41:37.611 --> 01:41:39.572
[SPEAKER_25]: Karaoke Cage Match!

01:41:42.513 --> 01:41:46.234
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright guys, here's the way the Karaoke Cage Match is going to work.

01:41:47.435 --> 01:41:58.699
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like the typical Cage Match, where there's going to be three songs that you're going to get to pick from, and the favorite that you pick will go into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio, just like any other song, alright?

01:41:59.960 --> 01:42:02.601
[SPEAKER_03]: But the deal is, is that instead of...

01:42:03.274 --> 01:42:08.877
[SPEAKER_03]: It being songs that are out there, you know, and like just songs that we pick out of the blue like we usually do.

01:42:09.377 --> 01:42:15.240
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll be songs sung by folks in the studio tonight via Karaoke Revolution Volume 3.

01:42:16.941 --> 01:42:19.142
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a good way for us to check out this game as well.

01:42:20.543 --> 01:42:21.964
[SPEAKER_03]: So now you see why Loki's pissed.

01:42:23.024 --> 01:42:24.385
[SPEAKER_03]: He bathed me all night.

01:42:24.585 --> 01:42:25.686
[SPEAKER_03]: He bathed me all night.

01:42:25.706 --> 01:42:26.726
[SPEAKER_03]: Do not do this segment.

01:42:26.946 --> 01:42:28.207
[SPEAKER_03]: Do not do the damn segment.

01:42:28.227 --> 01:42:29.348
[SPEAKER_03]: Do not do the damn segment.

01:42:30.368 --> 01:42:31.049
[SPEAKER_13]: Too bad.

01:42:32.458 --> 01:42:35.339
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, so who's going to start off tonight?

01:42:35.499 --> 01:42:36.179
[SPEAKER_25]: Me and you?

01:42:36.459 --> 01:42:37.600
[SPEAKER_25]: You want to start off?

01:42:37.900 --> 01:42:39.180
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, let's start it off.

01:42:39.200 --> 01:42:39.860
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to start off.

01:42:39.900 --> 01:42:46.402
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we're going to go over to Karaoke Revolution Volume 3, and I'm going to give the mic to Loki so he can vent a little bit of his anger while we set up for song number one.

01:42:46.842 --> 01:42:49.463
[SPEAKER_04]: The hell with all you people, I should have never bought that damn game.

01:42:50.544 --> 01:42:51.444
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck my girlfriend.

01:42:51.924 --> 01:42:52.204
[SPEAKER_13]: I know.

01:42:52.224 --> 01:42:52.804
[SPEAKER_13]: God damn it.

01:43:02.921 --> 01:43:04.522
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like this game very much.

01:43:05.242 --> 01:43:05.943
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

01:43:06.023 --> 01:43:08.044
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, what do we got?

01:43:08.084 --> 01:43:11.726
[SPEAKER_13]: So what are you going to play?

01:43:11.886 --> 01:43:13.968
[SPEAKER_04]: Indian Herbal Bowl!

01:43:18.090 --> 01:43:18.991
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Love Shack in a duet.

01:43:32.639 --> 01:43:34.820
[SPEAKER_03]: Juanagor and I are going to do Love Shack.

01:43:34.900 --> 01:43:38.163
[SPEAKER_03]: So is it going to pick up over the mics here, or do we need to have the mic nearby?

01:43:38.403 --> 01:43:39.523
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll pick up over the mics.

01:43:40.644 --> 01:43:43.066
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it'll pick up over the mics.

01:43:44.166 --> 01:43:46.548
[SPEAKER_13]: I love karaoke revolution.

01:43:46.568 --> 01:43:47.969
[SPEAKER_14]: I dislike this game.

01:44:01.914 --> 01:44:05.836
[SPEAKER_03]: If you see a faded sign at the side of the road that says 15 miles to the south

01:44:28.775 --> 01:44:30.400
Love Shack, yeah, yeah

01:49:26.232 --> 01:49:30.416
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's see how the chat was like in that one so far.

01:49:30.476 --> 01:49:31.256
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of looking there.

01:49:31.777 --> 01:49:32.998
[SPEAKER_03]: I heart love Shaq, da-da-da-da-da.

01:49:33.018 --> 01:49:34.960
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of getting some feedback there from the chat room.

01:49:34.980 --> 01:49:35.400
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

01:49:36.601 --> 01:49:41.205
[SPEAKER_25]: All right, let's go around the room and see what everybody thought of that, starting with Islander.

01:49:41.686 --> 01:49:42.406
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a good performance.

01:49:43.487 --> 01:49:44.408
[SPEAKER_25]: And on a scale of 1 to 10?

01:49:47.311 --> 01:49:47.671
[SPEAKER_06]: 7.5 to 8.

01:49:48.512 --> 01:49:48.892
[SPEAKER_19]: Loki.

01:49:49.873 --> 01:49:53.116
[SPEAKER_19]: I give it a 0 because this was the dumbest fucking Sigma ever.

01:49:54.352 --> 01:49:54.953
[SPEAKER_13]: What the hell with you?

01:49:55.053 --> 01:49:58.716
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm never letting you run a show ever again by yourself.

01:49:59.617 --> 01:49:59.897
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

01:50:01.439 --> 01:50:02.039
[SPEAKER_25]: DJ Rangel.

01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:05.302
[SPEAKER_25]: Aw, you're just kissing my ass.

01:50:05.342 --> 01:50:06.824
[SPEAKER_25]: Jonah, we just walked in.

01:50:06.864 --> 01:50:07.324
[SPEAKER_25]: Explosive.

01:50:09.386 --> 01:50:13.850
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, I just walked in and I have to say five.

01:50:13.870 --> 01:50:15.752
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, let's split it first.

01:50:23.004 --> 01:50:27.806
[SPEAKER_17]: Hey, what the hell is up with Granny?

01:50:27.826 --> 01:50:28.746
[SPEAKER_13]: Granny's rocking.

01:50:28.906 --> 01:50:30.847
[SPEAKER_13]: I love for Granny.

01:50:31.227 --> 01:50:32.467
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Islander's next.

01:50:32.527 --> 01:50:34.028
[SPEAKER_02]: What song are you going to sing for us, Islander?

01:50:34.368 --> 01:50:35.829
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh lord, let me take a look at the list here.

01:50:35.849 --> 01:50:36.589
[SPEAKER_25]: Uh-oh.

01:50:38.329 --> 01:50:39.050
[SPEAKER_25]: Not that list.

01:50:39.150 --> 01:50:39.490
[SPEAKER_25]: Wrong.

01:50:40.630 --> 01:50:41.391
[SPEAKER_25]: Let's try this again.

01:50:41.611 --> 01:50:44.572
I do not sing well.

01:50:44.632 --> 01:50:48.133
I do not like...

01:50:57.383 --> 01:51:00.204
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, he's going through and finding his song right now, what he wants to sing.

01:51:03.404 --> 01:51:08.525
[SPEAKER_02]: He was thinking about the Fugees, but passed on it.

01:51:12.166 --> 01:51:12.806
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe Dido?

01:51:13.926 --> 01:51:14.746
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Hoobastank!

01:51:15.407 --> 01:51:15.607
[SPEAKER_02]: No?

01:51:18.567 --> 01:51:19.067
[SPEAKER_02]: ABC.

01:51:21.768 --> 01:51:22.868
[SPEAKER_02]: Against All Odds is in there.

01:51:23.268 --> 01:51:24.488
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys know that one from DDR.

01:51:25.889 --> 01:51:27.069
[SPEAKER_02]: He's thinking about Hoobastank.

01:51:29.299 --> 01:51:31.101
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, he's giving his nod.

01:51:31.621 --> 01:51:32.462
[SPEAKER_02]: And he hit the X button.

01:51:32.622 --> 01:51:33.342
[SPEAKER_02]: He's stuck with it now.

01:51:33.682 --> 01:51:43.490
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Islander, song number two in tonight's cage match.

01:51:44.390 --> 01:51:45.832
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, song number two in tonight's cage match.

01:51:46.352 --> 01:51:48.013
[SPEAKER_02]: Islander, The Reason.

01:51:48.914 --> 01:51:54.638
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish this was volume one, because in that song I could do... Oh, hell, what the hell was it?

01:51:54.658 --> 01:51:55.379
[SPEAKER_06]: From Vertical Horizons?

01:52:06.307 --> 01:52:15.070
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not a perfect person There's many things I wish I didn't do But could I continue to

01:52:27.894 --> 01:52:41.121
[SPEAKER_13]: I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know I found a reason for me To change who I am

01:52:56.127 --> 01:53:06.572
[SPEAKER_13]: The reason to start over new And the reason is you It's only that I hurt you It's lost in a much deeper day

01:53:19.925 --> 01:53:31.894
[SPEAKER_13]: And all the pain I put you through I wish that I could take it all away And be the one who catches all your tears That's why I needed to hear I found a reason for me

01:53:48.067 --> 01:53:58.135
It changed who I used to be A reason to start over new And the reason is you And the reason is you

01:54:14.150 --> 01:54:15.691
I'm not a perfect person

01:54:35.477 --> 01:54:48.524
[SPEAKER_13]: I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know I found a reason for me To stay who I used to be

01:55:02.851 --> 01:55:03.812
Thank you for watching!

01:55:21.285 --> 01:55:24.386
All the girls there are swooning for

01:55:46.545 --> 01:55:47.025
[SPEAKER_25]: Islander.

01:55:47.105 --> 01:55:50.186
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, I know that was painful for a lot of people to listen to because it was painful for me to sing.

01:55:50.446 --> 01:55:50.787
[SPEAKER_25]: That's right.

01:55:51.047 --> 01:55:53.607
[SPEAKER_25]: Let's hear, let's go around and see what everybody thought of that.

01:55:53.647 --> 01:55:54.108
[SPEAKER_25]: Iguana Girl.

01:55:55.268 --> 01:55:56.128
[SPEAKER_13]: I still love you.

01:55:56.809 --> 01:55:57.509
[SPEAKER_13]: It's okay.

01:55:57.549 --> 01:55:58.049
[SPEAKER_25]: Yay.

01:55:59.389 --> 01:56:01.590
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, it was a little quiet, but I dug it.

01:56:02.370 --> 01:56:05.312
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, I think you would get girls throwing their panties at you any day.

01:56:05.632 --> 01:56:10.533
[SPEAKER_03]: So I give it, maybe tonight if you're lucky, I give it a seven.

01:56:12.834 --> 01:56:13.174
[SPEAKER_19]: Loki.

01:56:13.954 --> 01:56:15.295
[SPEAKER_19]: I give a little finger up to Robb.

01:56:17.341 --> 01:56:17.862
[SPEAKER_19]: That is it.

01:56:18.823 --> 01:56:19.844
[SPEAKER_19]: That wasn't painful.

01:56:20.744 --> 01:56:21.946
[SPEAKER_19]: Just give it a couple more minutes.

01:56:24.388 --> 01:56:25.149
[SPEAKER_19]: I fucking hate this.

01:56:25.369 --> 01:56:25.789
[SPEAKER_19]: Angel.

01:56:26.630 --> 01:56:27.932
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, uh, that was really good.

01:56:28.412 --> 01:56:35.139
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I'm gonna give it an 8 just cause I can, well, I don't have anything to say besides it was good.

01:56:35.679 --> 01:56:39.203
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, there was a couple parts that, you know,

01:56:41.217 --> 01:56:44.620
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

01:56:45.160 --> 01:56:45.861
[SPEAKER_25]: All right, Loki.

01:56:46.361 --> 01:56:47.842
[SPEAKER_25]: What song is Loki going to sing?

01:56:48.062 --> 01:56:48.723
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

01:56:49.643 --> 01:56:49.843
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh?

01:56:49.924 --> 01:56:50.404
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm sorry.

01:56:50.424 --> 01:56:50.744
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

01:56:50.784 --> 01:56:51.204
[SPEAKER_03]: Exquisite.

01:56:51.485 --> 01:56:52.946
[SPEAKER_03]: When he walked in, he was tardy.

01:56:53.066 --> 01:56:53.506
[SPEAKER_03]: What can you do?

01:56:53.706 --> 01:56:53.926
[SPEAKER_18]: I know.

01:56:53.986 --> 01:56:54.447
[SPEAKER_18]: I know.

01:56:55.127 --> 01:56:57.169
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, a mystic judge from Simon's view.

01:56:59.092 --> 01:57:01.554
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't wanna fuckin' play this!

01:57:02.174 --> 01:57:07.177
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, you did choke on some parts, but... Goddammit.

01:57:07.517 --> 01:57:08.878
[SPEAKER_18]: Give it a 7.5.

01:57:08.998 --> 01:57:09.918
[SPEAKER_18]: 7.5, alright.

01:57:10.178 --> 01:57:10.679
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright!

01:57:11.359 --> 01:57:14.781
[SPEAKER_25]: Here comes Loki, and he's so excited to be performing for you guys tonight.

01:57:16.442 --> 01:57:17.822
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm gonna kill you in your sleep!

01:57:20.864 --> 01:57:21.985
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm so excited about this.

01:57:22.545 --> 01:57:25.727
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, let's see here, what's a shitty- This mic is, like, really bad.

01:57:28.760 --> 01:57:31.421
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the song I like, which I will not be singing it.

01:57:32.961 --> 01:57:34.442
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I will not be singing it.

01:57:37.502 --> 01:57:40.983
[SPEAKER_04]: I really wish that we had Snake Eater unlocked, because at least that song would be fun.

01:58:00.873 --> 01:58:02.615
[SPEAKER_13]: See, that's why I like you.

01:58:02.695 --> 01:58:04.156
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why I like you.

01:58:04.276 --> 01:58:06.098
[SPEAKER_13]: As he passes, oops, I did it again.

01:58:06.158 --> 01:58:10.762
[SPEAKER_05]: As the whole room cheers, I'm gonna fucking kill you.

01:58:11.543 --> 01:58:13.244
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki's gonna do oops, I did it again.

[SPEAKER_13]: Come on.

[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, Loki, Loki, Loki, Loki, Loki.

01:58:26.527 --> 01:58:29.289
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, they do not feel bad.

01:58:29.309 --> 01:58:32.110
[SPEAKER_25]: They just wanted to hear the goddamn clip being played over and over again.

01:58:32.250 --> 01:58:34.412
[SPEAKER_25]: Listen, it wasn't funny the second time we tried it.

01:58:34.732 --> 01:58:37.093
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not going to be funny the third time.

01:58:54.672 --> 01:58:55.072
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

01:58:55.333 --> 01:58:56.114

[SPEAKER_03]: We did get one, Loki sucks.

01:59:21.890 --> 01:59:23.351
[SPEAKER_05]: One person would comment since.

01:59:26.731 --> 01:59:29.492
[SPEAKER_05]: This goes out to Rob, and I fucking hate him.

01:59:31.353 --> 01:59:32.833

[SPEAKER_14]: How did you fucking get a goal?

02:02:51.164 --> 02:02:54.106
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the listeners are going to vote this number one for a week on end.

02:02:56.095 --> 02:02:58.898
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go around the room and see what everybody thought of that one, starting with the Guana Girl.

02:02:59.519 --> 02:03:00.460
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought it was fabulous.

02:03:00.920 --> 02:03:02.922
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, I just can't believe it.

02:03:03.443 --> 02:03:03.883
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a 10.

02:03:04.905 --> 02:03:05.365
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a 10.

02:03:06.666 --> 02:03:07.087
[SPEAKER_06]: Islander.

02:03:07.547 --> 02:03:09.349
[SPEAKER_06]: It was so fabulous, I creamed my pants.

02:03:11.452 --> 02:03:11.772
[SPEAKER_06]: Angel.

02:03:13.314 --> 02:03:14.375
[SPEAKER_09]: Ew, it's so good.

02:03:14.415 --> 02:03:15.676
[SPEAKER_09]: Community value 10.

02:03:16.617 --> 02:03:17.178
[SPEAKER_17]: Exquisite.

02:03:18.068 --> 02:03:18.989
[SPEAKER_08]: He's dead.

02:03:20.150 --> 02:03:23.652
[SPEAKER_08]: I think he was one of those that got attacked with a butcher knife.

02:03:24.993 --> 02:03:26.534
[SPEAKER_09]: He's alive!

02:03:27.675 --> 02:03:31.337
[SPEAKER_18]: As for my thoughts... I think we're going to make a new record.

02:03:32.939 --> 02:03:34.820
[SPEAKER_18]: Number one billboard chart.

02:03:35.600 --> 02:03:38.322
[SPEAKER_03]: I give it a 10, and can I sleep over at your place tonight?

02:03:38.342 --> 02:03:38.442
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

02:03:38.462 --> 02:03:38.743

[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to do it again and again, if I'm still alive, after this break.

02:04:00.338 --> 02:04:01.779
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be right back, boys and girls.

02:04:01.819 --> 02:04:03.841
[SPEAKER_03]: The FUs of the week are coming up pretty soon.

02:04:04.101 --> 02:04:05.622
[SPEAKER_03]: Although now I'm having second thoughts.

02:04:07.943 --> 02:04:09.084
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be back after this.

02:04:33.829 --> 02:04:34.950

[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio.

02:08:44.636 --> 02:08:46.818
[SPEAKER_03]: We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.

02:08:54.683 --> 02:08:56.884
[SPEAKER_03]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:08:58.265 --> 02:09:02.208
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's time to reveal the winner of tonight's cage match.

02:09:03.348 --> 02:09:05.490
[SPEAKER_03]: And the winner of tonight's cage match is...

02:09:06.320 --> 02:09:08.081
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki with Oops I Did It Again.

02:09:08.702 --> 02:09:10.483
[SPEAKER_03]: Why are we not surprised?

02:09:10.503 --> 02:09:11.144
[SPEAKER_03]: Surprised, surprised.

02:09:11.164 --> 02:09:11.624
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what though?

02:09:11.944 --> 02:09:14.586
[SPEAKER_03]: The other two songs got a surprising amount of pity votes.

02:09:14.747 --> 02:09:16.108
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was very pleased.

02:09:16.148 --> 02:09:19.410
[SPEAKER_03]: So the effort did not go unappreciated by the rest of us.

02:09:20.171 --> 02:09:21.632
[SPEAKER_03]: We knew that Loki was going to cream us though.

02:09:23.413 --> 02:09:24.214
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I have a hug, Loki?

02:09:24.734 --> 02:09:25.155
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

02:09:26.976 --> 02:09:29.698
[SPEAKER_03]: He's taking off his aggressions on the Mario 64 right now.

02:09:29.778 --> 02:09:30.359
[SPEAKER_03]: So what can you do?

02:09:31.710 --> 02:09:33.111
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, like, what is that?

02:09:33.712 --> 02:09:36.894
[SPEAKER_03]: Why are you holding two DSs over there, Angel?

02:09:39.936 --> 02:09:40.977
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are crazy.

02:09:41.618 --> 02:09:42.058
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

02:09:43.539 --> 02:09:46.001
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations, Loki, for winning tonight's cage match.

02:09:47.022 --> 02:09:52.426
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was funny because one person, when they voted, I was going through the votes, one person said, this is the only time you'll ever see me voting for Brittany.

02:09:56.769 --> 02:09:57.410
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that was funny.

02:09:57.950 --> 02:09:58.771
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, um...

02:10:00.471 --> 02:10:03.012
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do some winners for the MidiHead CDs.

02:10:04.212 --> 02:10:05.733
[SPEAKER_03]: So hurry up, last chance to get in.

02:10:05.773 --> 02:10:11.574
[SPEAKER_03]: Free stuff at OrangeOnTrader.com And also he said he was still taking some stuff on his site over at MidiHead.com too.

02:10:11.955 --> 02:10:16.996
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, just use the email little bubble on his site and there's a little submission form.

02:10:18.851 --> 02:10:19.191
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.

02:10:19.271 --> 02:10:22.392
[SPEAKER_03]: And we got that song that he wanted to play earlier.

02:10:22.652 --> 02:10:25.393
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually, I believe it's an unreleased track, so I'm pretty excited.

02:10:25.413 --> 02:10:29.654
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to be playing an unreleased track of his later, so very excited we're going to be hearing that.

02:10:30.154 --> 02:10:34.115
[SPEAKER_03]: In that break, before we came back, you heard some music from Parapara Paradise.

02:10:34.675 --> 02:10:35.316
[SPEAKER_03]: You know that game.

02:10:35.336 --> 02:10:36.436
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever happened to that game?

02:10:36.476 --> 02:10:37.676
[SPEAKER_03]: Why did that game have to die?

02:10:38.697 --> 02:10:42.938
[SPEAKER_03]: It was one of those games that was cool when it first came out, and then it sucked, and then it was cool again.

02:10:43.058 --> 02:10:46.959
[SPEAKER_06]: What was cool about that game is that when we first played it, we had no idea what the hell Parapara was.

02:10:47.984 --> 02:10:51.926
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we learned, and then it just wasn't as cool as it was.

02:10:53.267 --> 02:10:53.647
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

02:10:58.350 --> 02:10:59.851
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, it was like one of those things where it was like...

02:11:01.539 --> 02:11:05.181
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was cool when people didn't know that you had to do line dances to it, basically.

02:11:05.221 --> 02:11:07.943
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when you found out you had to do the synchronized dance, it was kind of suck.

02:11:08.243 --> 02:11:10.245
[SPEAKER_03]: But some people really got into it, which is, you know, good for them.

02:11:10.625 --> 02:11:16.028
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when, you know, people just started to have fun with it and not take it so seriously, I think it was cool again.

02:11:16.108 --> 02:11:18.390
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can go back and listen to that music anytime now.

02:11:18.430 --> 02:11:21.472
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, there was a period there, though, where it was like, oh, para, para.

02:11:22.392 --> 02:11:22.772
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, God.

02:11:22.893 --> 02:11:23.673
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you're a beat.

02:11:23.713 --> 02:11:26.835
[SPEAKER_06]: But no, I understand what you're saying about, like, going back and listening to the music.

02:11:26.895 --> 02:11:27.115
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

02:11:28.176 --> 02:11:28.256
Hmm.

02:11:28.860 --> 02:11:29.501
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:11:50.575 --> 02:11:56.779
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I noticed some folks in the chat room right now are talking about Disney's rave and some of the non-stops.

02:11:56.799 --> 02:12:01.221
[SPEAKER_03]: It was kind of making me think, how did everything go over for Thanksgiving with you guys' non-stop marathon?

02:12:01.501 --> 02:12:02.222
[SPEAKER_08]: Very, very well.

02:12:02.982 --> 02:12:06.664
[SPEAKER_08]: We had some large listener counts on both days.

02:12:07.385 --> 02:12:10.066
[SPEAKER_08]: I really hadn't anticipated on doing both days because I didn't, you know.

02:12:10.486 --> 02:12:15.109
[SPEAKER_08]: You know how you have your TBS version of A Christmas Story?

02:12:15.789 --> 02:12:18.791
[SPEAKER_08]: How they'll play it for like 24 hours straight and just...

02:12:19.151 --> 02:12:20.613
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:12:36.449 --> 02:12:41.810
[SPEAKER_08]: Not quite as many people on the Friday rebroadcast, but still very, very respectable.

02:12:42.451 --> 02:12:43.651
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of people tuned in.

02:12:43.691 --> 02:12:44.171
[SPEAKER_08]: It was great.

02:12:45.231 --> 02:12:53.994
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, of course, we did the Orange Lounge Rewind directly after, so I'm hoping that we got some of those people to listen in, so we got you guys some more exposure, too.

02:12:54.114 --> 02:12:54.454
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

02:12:54.474 --> 02:12:55.114
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

02:12:55.194 --> 02:12:55.914
[SPEAKER_03]: We appreciate the help.

02:12:56.374 --> 02:12:59.195
[SPEAKER_03]: And anything else exciting coming up on DDR Freak Radio in the near future?

02:13:00.155 --> 02:13:01.096
[SPEAKER_08]: Not at the present time.

02:13:01.116 --> 02:13:12.520
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to work with one of the moderators on a side project, see if maybe we can get that kind of working, but I don't know when that's going to be coming up.

02:13:12.840 --> 02:13:13.280
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

02:13:13.340 --> 02:13:15.721
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure you guys will hear all about it by the time.

02:13:16.181 --> 02:13:16.662
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure we will.

02:13:16.682 --> 02:13:17.442
[SPEAKER_03]: It's ready.

02:13:17.542 --> 02:13:19.723
[SPEAKER_03]: And we should do something for the end of the year.

02:13:20.183 --> 02:13:20.443
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

02:13:20.483 --> 02:13:21.323
[SPEAKER_03]: Think of something to do.

02:13:21.684 --> 02:13:21.944
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

02:13:22.084 --> 02:13:22.444
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do it.

02:13:22.464 --> 02:13:22.604
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

02:13:22.964 --> 02:13:23.885
[SPEAKER_03]: Countdown or something.

02:13:23.905 --> 02:13:24.305
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be fun.

02:13:24.345 --> 02:13:24.825
[SPEAKER_08]: We could do that.

02:13:24.845 --> 02:13:25.345
[SPEAKER_08]: We could do that.

02:13:25.545 --> 02:13:26.906
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to meet at my place anyway.

02:13:27.206 --> 02:13:27.646
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

02:13:27.666 --> 02:13:28.567
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

02:13:28.587 --> 02:13:29.547
[SPEAKER_03]: Live broadcast, maybe?

02:13:29.667 --> 02:13:29.887
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

02:13:30.088 --> 02:13:30.448
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

02:13:30.928 --> 02:13:35.470
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, I hear that there's a reunion show in the works for Under Sedation Live.

02:13:35.730 --> 02:13:36.471
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

02:13:36.551 --> 02:13:38.151
[SPEAKER_03]: Got contacted about that one today.

02:13:38.191 --> 02:13:39.132
[SPEAKER_03]: That should be interesting.

02:13:39.512 --> 02:13:48.738
[SPEAKER_03]: For those who don't know, Iguana Girl and I used to be co-hosts on a show over on another station, Under Station Live, which is still going, by the way, still kicking, over on Live 365.

02:13:49.098 --> 02:13:51.339
[SPEAKER_03]: UnderStationLive.org is the site, if you want to check it out.

02:13:51.599 --> 02:13:54.141
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's going to be a reunion show coming up with Iguana Girl and myself.

02:13:54.181 --> 02:13:54.821
[SPEAKER_03]: That should be fun.

02:13:54.881 --> 02:13:57.563
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe DarkSakura's going to be in on it, too, because she was a big part of it.

02:13:57.583 --> 02:13:58.564
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, she was a big part of it.

02:13:58.584 --> 02:14:01.465
[SPEAKER_03]: She was the most frequent... No, Islander or her.

02:14:01.966 --> 02:14:04.627
[SPEAKER_03]: Either her or Islander was the most frequent guest at the end of it.

02:14:04.747 --> 02:14:08.530
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so it'll probably be a situation where we'll all just hang out and...

02:14:09.250 --> 02:14:15.552
[SPEAKER_08]: OneRoom, and then Skype with Travis Donovan over there and see if we can get it all working.

02:14:15.572 --> 02:14:15.972
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.

02:14:15.992 --> 02:14:17.452
[SPEAKER_08]: See if we can recapture the magic.

02:14:17.613 --> 02:14:17.813
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

02:14:18.553 --> 02:14:20.233
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though it'll kind of be virtual a little bit.

02:14:20.273 --> 02:14:20.573
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

02:14:21.694 --> 02:14:25.895
[SPEAKER_03]: Travis won't be able to throw any of his figures at me, which will be kind of sad, but, you know, what can you do?

02:14:25.995 --> 02:14:27.295
[SPEAKER_06]: And I won't be able to see the white boy dance.

02:14:27.936 --> 02:14:28.796
[SPEAKER_03]: No white boy dance.

02:14:28.816 --> 02:14:29.996
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have to get him a webcam or something.

02:14:30.616 --> 02:14:30.856
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

02:14:31.137 --> 02:14:31.457
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:14:31.577 --> 02:14:34.318
[SPEAKER_08]: No piles and piles of cigarette butts in the ashtray.

02:14:36.696 --> 02:14:42.879
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of also brought up DDR Freak for a reason because I was kind of reading, you know, as a lot of people in the Bomani scene do, I was reading the message boards over there.

02:14:43.659 --> 02:14:47.581
[SPEAKER_03]: And a little bit of spatting going on in the Ultramix 2 thread right now.

02:14:47.601 --> 02:14:48.401
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit of spatting.

02:14:49.147 --> 02:14:49.387
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

02:14:49.407 --> 02:14:50.268
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't read that.

02:14:50.748 --> 02:14:54.430
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, but nothing that needs moderation going on or anything.

02:14:54.470 --> 02:15:00.613
[SPEAKER_03]: But just, you know, some people are a little upset with Ultramix 2, saying the timing is a big issue.

02:15:00.633 --> 02:15:03.255
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're saying, we need a patch for Ultramix 2.

02:15:03.995 --> 02:15:06.577
[SPEAKER_03]: Dear KCEH, patch Ultramix 2.

02:15:06.837 --> 02:15:10.239
[SPEAKER_03]: The timing is screwed up, and it's screwing up my PA.

02:15:10.339 --> 02:15:12.460
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't they do this already before?

02:15:12.480 --> 02:15:14.101
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

02:15:14.537 --> 02:15:15.218
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably.

02:15:15.238 --> 02:15:15.538
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

02:15:15.978 --> 02:15:18.240
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't this the same gripe that they've had?

02:15:19.081 --> 02:15:19.681
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting.

02:15:19.721 --> 02:15:25.565
[SPEAKER_03]: With every new mix that comes out, first bitch, the steps, second bitch, the timing, third bitch, the song list.

02:15:25.986 --> 02:15:26.826
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing is enough.

02:15:27.187 --> 02:15:27.927
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing is enough.

02:15:29.148 --> 02:15:29.969
[SPEAKER_08]: Drives me bonkers.

02:15:29.989 --> 02:15:30.349
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

02:15:30.389 --> 02:15:30.649
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

02:15:31.710 --> 02:15:34.652
[SPEAKER_03]: The nice thing is that nobody was really bitching about the song list or the steps this time.

02:15:34.893 --> 02:15:35.773
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think the timing.

02:15:35.793 --> 02:15:36.114
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, no.

02:15:36.414 --> 02:15:37.775
[SPEAKER_08]: They have to bitch about something.

02:15:38.455 --> 02:15:43.539
[SPEAKER_08]: It would not be, you know, in a consumer-run society, they have to bitch about something.

02:15:44.740 --> 02:15:45.660
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, exactly.

02:15:46.120 --> 02:15:47.321
[SPEAKER_08]: They have to bitch about something.

02:15:47.521 --> 02:15:49.101
[SPEAKER_08]: No matter what, they have to bitch about something.

02:15:49.161 --> 02:15:54.443
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess, you know, we just have to kind of deal with it and kind of ignore the idiots as much as we can.

02:15:55.703 --> 02:15:58.604
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I'm trying to look at both sides of it.

02:15:58.644 --> 02:16:00.544
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I try to take, you know, perspective.

02:16:00.865 --> 02:16:03.145
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I got to see both sides of points of view here.

02:16:03.745 --> 02:16:06.186
[SPEAKER_03]: And, yeah, the timing window is a little different from the arcade.

02:16:06.626 --> 02:16:07.606
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's the thing.

02:16:07.746 --> 02:16:09.187
[SPEAKER_03]: Ultramix is not the arcade.

02:16:09.427 --> 02:16:09.527
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:14.420
[SPEAKER_03]: and I think that's what a lot of people often forget is that DDR in the arcade right now here in the U.S.

02:16:15.089 --> 02:16:15.849
[SPEAKER_03]: is six feet under.

02:16:16.210 --> 02:16:20.451
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, is there a chance that it will rise from the grave and, you know... Lord, I hope so.

02:16:20.532 --> 02:16:22.032
[SPEAKER_03]: ...kick some ass again in the arcade?

02:16:22.192 --> 02:16:22.693
[SPEAKER_03]: We hope so.

02:16:22.753 --> 02:16:23.553
[SPEAKER_03]: We really, really hope so.

02:16:23.993 --> 02:16:25.974
[SPEAKER_03]: But for now, you know, home version is what we got.

02:16:26.614 --> 02:16:27.695
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know.

02:16:27.735 --> 02:16:36.759
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the comparisons to Extreme and the other Japanese mixes are very interesting when you consider that they're not even really supposed to be here.

02:16:37.619 --> 02:16:38.120
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?

02:16:38.280 --> 02:16:38.580
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

02:16:38.740 --> 02:16:40.000
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know.

02:16:41.481 --> 02:16:43.202
[SPEAKER_03]: I can kind of see why...

02:16:45.298 --> 02:16:48.599
[SPEAKER_03]: There might be a difference, too, in the fact that you're dealing with completely different hardware.

02:16:49.180 --> 02:16:52.301
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're dealing with an engine that was probably written from the ground up.

02:16:53.061 --> 02:16:55.022
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't really written to emulate the arcade.

02:16:55.042 --> 02:16:56.102
[SPEAKER_03]: It was written to be something new.

02:16:56.222 --> 02:16:58.523
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's what a lot of people have grown to appreciate about Ultramix 2.

02:16:59.063 --> 02:16:59.604
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?

02:16:59.944 --> 02:17:01.564
[SPEAKER_03]: Where it's kind of like, it's supposed to be something new.

02:17:02.285 --> 02:17:03.365
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not going to get it 100%.

02:17:05.166 --> 02:17:06.546
[SPEAKER_03]: But, I don't know.

02:17:07.607 --> 02:17:09.727
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, like I said, it's going to be something.

02:17:09.887 --> 02:17:11.148
[SPEAKER_08]: It's always going to be something.

02:17:11.927 --> 02:17:12.547
[SPEAKER_08]: No matter what.

02:17:13.488 --> 02:17:21.352
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's frustrating that people can't just appreciate the fact that we are getting these new mixes and that these are things that we...

02:17:22.840 --> 02:17:25.222
[SPEAKER_08]: How long ago weren't expecting to get any of?

02:17:25.803 --> 02:17:27.484
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, what, less than two years ago?

02:17:27.504 --> 02:17:28.065
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh-huh.

02:17:28.245 --> 02:17:29.526
[SPEAKER_08]: We were having to import everything.

02:17:29.746 --> 02:17:30.107
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh-huh.

02:17:30.347 --> 02:17:39.074
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I personally, I'm just thankful the fact that we have these mixes and the fact that we're getting, that we have, you know, people that are interested enough in it to keep us going.

02:17:39.495 --> 02:17:44.179
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not going to say that people who are complaining about it are not thankful because chances are they are.

02:17:44.239 --> 02:17:45.220
[SPEAKER_03]: They probably love the game.

02:17:45.420 --> 02:17:45.620
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

02:17:45.640 --> 02:17:46.561
[SPEAKER_08]: They just, you know, they want to find ways.

02:17:46.581 --> 02:17:48.703
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not expressing it and that's my concern.

02:17:48.743 --> 02:17:49.984
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to find ways to make it better.

02:17:50.564 --> 02:17:53.767
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but there's ways to go about that.

02:17:54.828 --> 02:18:01.634
[SPEAKER_08]: And bitching on a message board, you know, namely DDR Freak, is not the way to go about doing so.

02:18:02.495 --> 02:18:05.258
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, write your complaints in a letter.

02:18:06.078 --> 02:18:08.180
[SPEAKER_08]: Send it to the appropriate parties.

02:18:08.220 --> 02:18:09.782
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't just bitch about it on a message board.

02:18:10.763 --> 02:18:10.983
[SPEAKER_08]: You know?

02:18:12.147 --> 02:18:12.888
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't need it.

02:18:13.028 --> 02:18:15.669
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't need the drama.

02:18:15.870 --> 02:18:17.531
[SPEAKER_08]: We got enough drama on our own.

02:18:33.663 --> 02:18:37.489
[SPEAKER_03]: OrangeLoungeRadio.com Era, End of the Century, La Señorita, Silent Hill, I Feel the Junk Circuit Mix

02:18:48.277 --> 02:18:50.798
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what... And a lot of people are saying it ain't worth it.

02:18:50.818 --> 02:18:52.078
[SPEAKER_03]: We've played these songs to death.

02:18:52.278 --> 02:18:53.038
[SPEAKER_08]: Then don't buy it.

02:18:53.178 --> 02:18:56.739
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm seeing... And a lot of people are expressing they're not going to, which is, you know, fine.

02:18:56.779 --> 02:19:01.880
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is one of those things where I kind of see it's really Konami is in a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation.

02:19:01.920 --> 02:19:07.321
[SPEAKER_03]: Because when they don't give us these songs, people go, there's not enough of the Japanese mixes in the game.

02:19:08.621 --> 02:19:13.802
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm kind of like... These songs here are like staple DDR songs.

02:19:14.082 --> 02:19:14.242
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

02:19:14.402 --> 02:19:16.383
[SPEAKER_03]: Have never been on the Xbox before.

02:19:16.483 --> 02:19:17.823
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're not a PS2 owner...

02:19:18.743 --> 02:19:19.683
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a godsend.

02:19:19.724 --> 02:19:25.026
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like if you're not an Xbox owner, Festival is probably great for you.

02:19:25.066 --> 02:19:29.368
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas a lot of people are hating on it because they're saying, it's just a copy of the Xbox version.

02:19:29.408 --> 02:19:36.151
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, but if I were living in Japan and I didn't import my games from the US, which I imagine not a lot of people do, I'd probably love it.

02:19:37.092 --> 02:19:37.952
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know.

02:19:39.208 --> 02:19:43.992
[SPEAKER_08]: I think a lot of the people are just kind of taking it with a grain of salt at this point.

02:19:44.052 --> 02:19:47.074
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you can't take it personally.

02:19:47.594 --> 02:19:50.777
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't take a lot of the complaints to heart.

02:19:50.917 --> 02:19:51.977
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, oh yeah.

02:19:52.038 --> 02:19:54.559
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know most people at Konami probably don't.

02:19:54.579 --> 02:19:57.361
[SPEAKER_03]: And they probably do take each criticism.

02:19:57.401 --> 02:20:00.243
[SPEAKER_03]: They probably say, okay, maybe we should... Yeah, but after about the 15th...

02:20:01.263 --> 02:20:02.223
[SPEAKER_08]: Billionth Time.

02:20:02.603 --> 02:20:09.286
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe in the next song pack, just two or three of these songs, and then two or three new songs, and maybe people will be happier.

02:20:09.426 --> 02:20:09.846
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

02:20:11.766 --> 02:20:12.107
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

02:20:12.487 --> 02:20:12.887
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree.

02:20:13.087 --> 02:20:15.428
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they're in a damn if you do, damn if you don't situation.

02:20:15.568 --> 02:20:17.648
[SPEAKER_03]: There's five more song packs to go, boys and girls.

02:20:17.888 --> 02:20:19.349
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the best is still yet to come.

02:20:20.009 --> 02:20:23.190
[SPEAKER_03]: I think one of the better song packs for Ultramix 1 was one of the later ones.

02:20:23.210 --> 02:20:24.331
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say it was song pack 4?

02:20:25.831 --> 02:20:26.732
[SPEAKER_03]: was a really good one.

02:20:28.333 --> 02:20:30.395
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, hold on to your butts.

02:20:30.635 --> 02:20:31.455
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be a fun ride.

02:20:31.796 --> 02:20:41.823
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's going to be better... I mean, I will probably buy this song pack anyway just so I can play these songs on Xbox Live because I would like to play Era on Xbox Live because I love TAC.

02:20:42.264 --> 02:20:50.130
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, that's enough to seal the deal for me right there is that we haven't had a lot of these songs in 60 frames a second and, you know, on Xbox Live before, so why not?

02:20:50.530 --> 02:20:53.412
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're not going to buy it, then fine, I won't play you.

02:20:55.563 --> 02:20:55.663
[SPEAKER_03]: F.U.S.

02:20:55.683 --> 02:20:55.943
[SPEAKER_03]: of the Week

02:21:24.927 --> 02:21:25.629
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, this is bad.

02:21:25.669 --> 02:21:26.490
[SPEAKER_08]: Here is justice.

02:21:26.911 --> 02:21:27.912
[SPEAKER_13]: Here is punishment.

02:21:42.597 --> 02:21:51.332
[SPEAKER_03]: On behalf of Jamie, I'll just enter in an F you to old people and drivers, stupid people, uneducated people.

02:21:52.534 --> 02:21:54.678
[SPEAKER_03]: What else does Jamie... Customers.

02:21:54.698 --> 02:21:55.399
[SPEAKER_03]: Customers.

02:21:56.080 --> 02:21:56.521
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so...

02:21:57.583 --> 02:21:59.863
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I probably hit on something in there, I hope.

02:21:59.983 --> 02:22:00.384
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

02:22:00.624 --> 02:22:01.224
[SPEAKER_08]: Hurricanes.

02:22:01.684 --> 02:22:02.224
[SPEAKER_03]: That too.

02:22:02.264 --> 02:22:02.924
[SPEAKER_03]: Light prices.

02:22:03.184 --> 02:22:04.644
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe, you know what, maybe... Yeah, light prices.

02:22:04.664 --> 02:22:07.385
[SPEAKER_03]: She's probably pissed off at jet lag right now, being in Alabama.

02:22:07.885 --> 02:22:07.985
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

02:22:08.045 --> 02:22:12.026
[SPEAKER_03]: So... And I'm sure she's missing us really badly.

02:22:12.546 --> 02:22:16.566
[SPEAKER_03]: She would give an F you to missing Skye and Loki and Iguana Girl and Islander and everybody here.

02:22:18.107 --> 02:22:19.067
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, anyway, let's move on.

02:22:19.347 --> 02:22:24.988
[SPEAKER_13]: Jimmy.

02:22:25.008 --> 02:22:25.088
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

02:22:26.963 --> 02:22:31.044
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck you to Mario 64 DS for being frustrating.

02:22:31.485 --> 02:22:34.686
[SPEAKER_04]: No wonder I didn't have the original game, it was too frustrating.

02:22:34.986 --> 02:22:42.909
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to throw my DS, but then before I throw it, I realize how expensive it was, and then don't throw it, and continue to play the game and get frustrated even more.

02:22:43.989 --> 02:22:50.911
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, anyway, and also, fuck you to leaves, there's still tons of them outside, and they're still piled up next to my car.

02:22:50.951 --> 02:22:55.173
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of car, fuck you to my car, because it's broken in some way and I don't know why.

02:22:55.996 --> 02:23:03.121
[SPEAKER_04]: And the problem is, is I don't want to take another day off of work just to go down to the dealership and take my car down there so they can tell me that they don't know what's wrong with it.

02:23:03.141 --> 02:23:03.961
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's broken.

02:23:04.602 --> 02:23:14.248
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, um, so it still drives, and I don't think it's anything major, like maybe the alignment's off or, you know, the brakes are falling off or something, but other than that, you know, it's fine.

02:23:14.869 --> 02:23:22.074
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, then, uh, really, I don't know, fuck you for wasting this entire four-day weekend on Final Fantasy XI.

02:23:23.226 --> 02:23:24.687
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I really didn't do anything.

02:23:24.727 --> 02:23:26.809
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't work on my cabinet, which I should have.

02:23:26.929 --> 02:23:31.693
[SPEAKER_04]: And I didn't, you know, clean house or, you know, God knows what else.

02:23:31.973 --> 02:23:33.474
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, visit family or something.

02:23:34.355 --> 02:23:35.175
[SPEAKER_04]: So that sucks.

02:23:35.616 --> 02:23:38.218
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, what else?

02:23:38.438 --> 02:23:49.847
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, just, um, fuck you to work because, you know, Movie Gallery is talking about buying Hollywood video and that means that there will be twice as many stupid people that I have to talk to every day.

02:23:50.547 --> 02:23:51.328
[SPEAKER_04]: So that sucks.

02:23:54.246 --> 02:23:56.968
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh wait, no!

02:23:57.409 --> 02:23:59.311
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck you for Karaoke Revolution!

02:23:59.331 --> 02:24:04.255
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why I bought that game and wasted my money, but whatever.

02:24:04.355 --> 02:24:10.801
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, I'm done.

02:24:15.085 --> 02:24:17.007
[SPEAKER_03]: I escaped the FUs, I was so happy.

02:24:17.027 --> 02:24:17.507
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

02:24:18.678 --> 02:24:20.779
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, I'm actually not very angry this week.

02:24:20.819 --> 02:24:26.642
[SPEAKER_03]: I think F you to just the time really flying by these past four days and the realization that I gotta go back to work tomorrow.

02:24:27.442 --> 02:24:32.625
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that, I mean, I love my job, don't get me wrong, I absolutely adore my job, but you know, I adore sitting on my ass even more.

02:24:33.385 --> 02:24:36.707
[SPEAKER_03]: Really is what it boils down to, so I can't, you know.

02:24:37.467 --> 02:24:41.729
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to Halo 2 and getting killed by 13 year olds and then being made fun of by them.

02:24:42.284 --> 02:24:43.645
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

02:24:57.250 --> 02:25:03.212
[SPEAKER_03]: and FU to Sigurd, because he said that he would only be able to battle me on controller tonight on Xbox Live.

02:25:03.232 --> 02:25:06.633
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to have to postpone the battle until later anyway, because we're running out of time.

02:25:07.073 --> 02:25:12.555
[SPEAKER_03]: And we did, the karaoke thing kind of bumped him, which I'm sure he's pleased about, and he'll probably give me an FU about that later, but we'll see.

02:25:13.195 --> 02:25:16.356
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, otherwise, I think I'm okay.

02:25:16.776 --> 02:25:17.957
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had a pretty good weekend.

02:25:18.177 --> 02:25:22.038
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a lot to be thankful for this Thanksgiving season, and, um...

02:25:23.200 --> 02:25:23.700
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I know.

02:25:24.121 --> 02:25:33.085
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to whoever decided... My really, really good friend Christopher was in the hospital for his appendix, to have his appendix taken out.

02:25:33.826 --> 02:25:39.488
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to whoever decided to play a cruel joke on him and make him go back to have his gallbladder taken out two days later.

02:25:41.149 --> 02:25:41.770
[SPEAKER_03]: That sucks.

02:25:42.270 --> 02:25:43.531
[SPEAKER_03]: Feel better soon, Christopher.

02:25:43.591 --> 02:25:44.091
[SPEAKER_03]: We miss you.

02:25:45.114 --> 02:25:49.398
[SPEAKER_04]: And fuck you, Comedy Central, for not having a new episode drawn together on this week.

02:25:49.438 --> 02:25:53.381
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to wait fucking another week for a brand new episode, and that pisses me off.

02:25:54.302 --> 02:25:59.566
[SPEAKER_04]: But thank you for airing two nights in a row, South Park, bigger, longer, and uncut.

02:26:00.627 --> 02:26:04.250
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you for steering my FUs in a completely different direction.

02:26:04.691 --> 02:26:06.392
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on to Iguana Girl.

02:26:06.432 --> 02:26:07.233
[SPEAKER_03]: She's got a microphone.

02:26:08.934 --> 02:26:11.296
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a microphone, and I'm not afraid to use it.

02:26:11.316 --> 02:26:11.357
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

02:26:12.819 --> 02:26:29.479
[SPEAKER_08]: Big huge F you to my car for having this really weird really screwed up like brake problem that is inconsistent and only happens when it's not raining and now I also screw my car because it uh

02:26:30.034 --> 02:26:34.019
[SPEAKER_08]: Decided to start making a squealing noise whenever I make a hard turn left, also.

02:26:34.420 --> 02:26:48.818
[SPEAKER_08]: So, uh, yeah, so, uh, this is, like, multiple issues that the people over at Pet Boys could not figure out, and now I have to take it to the dealership to have them look at it and tell me that, you know, I need to spend, like, a thousand dollars to get it fixed or something like that.

02:26:50.626 --> 02:26:58.954
[SPEAKER_08]: and big huge fuck you to the fact that I actually had to work on Friday while all of you guys were being lazy asses and had Friday off.

02:26:59.154 --> 02:26:59.535
[SPEAKER_13]: Yay!

02:27:02.822 --> 02:27:06.465
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, being in retail-ish stuff sucks.

02:27:08.566 --> 02:27:12.850
[SPEAKER_08]: And a big huge FU to still having like two weeks left of school.

02:27:12.950 --> 02:27:15.812
[SPEAKER_08]: And a big huge FU to having to study for finals soon.

02:27:16.873 --> 02:27:19.615
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's about it.

02:27:20.856 --> 02:27:22.577
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, let's move on to Islander.

02:27:23.518 --> 02:27:25.139
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, I've got a big FU.

02:27:25.940 --> 02:27:29.722
[SPEAKER_06]: To the state of California for sending me a jury duty notice.

02:27:31.045 --> 02:27:38.068
[SPEAKER_06]: I faxed in the stuff that I needed to fax in saying I cannot take time off from work, yada yada.

02:27:38.568 --> 02:27:40.149
[SPEAKER_06]: I never got a response.

02:27:40.229 --> 02:27:40.969
[SPEAKER_06]: How lovely!

02:27:42.690 --> 02:27:44.350
[SPEAKER_03]: Be glad you're not on the Peterson jury.

02:27:45.111 --> 02:27:45.391
[SPEAKER_06]: Really.

02:27:46.111 --> 02:27:48.952
[SPEAKER_06]: So, unfortunately, tomorrow is supposed to be my day off.

02:27:49.772 --> 02:27:54.954
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to, unfortunately, go down to the courthouse and see if I get picked to serve in a jury.

02:27:56.255 --> 02:27:57.275
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no, no, no.

02:27:57.716 --> 02:27:58.216
[SPEAKER_06]: In my LJ...

02:27:59.110 --> 02:28:06.875
[SPEAKER_06]: Good buddy of mine, Jabberwocky, suggested walking into the courthouse with a copy of the Weekly World News to show how unintelligent I am, and I think I'll do that.

02:28:08.176 --> 02:28:08.697
[SPEAKER_02]: Fabulous.

02:28:09.297 --> 02:28:19.084
[SPEAKER_06]: Second FU is actually also to the state of California for a late payment on my car insurance, and they want to suspend my license.

02:28:21.417 --> 02:28:22.678
[SPEAKER_08]: Big huge long story behind that.

02:28:22.698 --> 02:28:23.979
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not going to get into that.

02:28:24.079 --> 02:28:26.841
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, long story short, he's got to do that tomorrow too.

02:28:27.261 --> 02:28:31.364
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I've got a really long day with this data, and I really don't like this data at this point.

02:28:33.645 --> 02:28:43.412
[SPEAKER_06]: But other than that, and also, as I want to go mention, as you do working on Friday, that sucks, but hey, I need the money.

02:28:46.614 --> 02:28:48.355
[SPEAKER_06]: And yep, that's about it.

02:28:48.375 --> 02:28:51.057
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's move on to DDR Angel.

02:28:54.057 --> 02:28:54.237
[SPEAKER_09]: Addict.

02:28:54.838 --> 02:28:57.920
[SPEAKER_09]: Tell him I got my first summon today and I'm very excited.

02:28:57.960 --> 02:28:58.460
[SPEAKER_09]: My summoner is level 20.

02:28:58.560 --> 02:28:58.801
[SPEAKER_09]: Addict.

02:29:24.534 --> 02:29:35.142
[SPEAKER_09]: and F you to the party in FF11 that I was in the other day because I said I had to go and deal with real life issues and they said, what's real life?

02:29:36.063 --> 02:29:40.386
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm like, okay, bye-bye, bye-bye now, bye-bye.

02:29:41.146 --> 02:29:49.933
[SPEAKER_09]: So just F you to that because you guys are probably 13 and don't know any better and don't have a life like the rest of us that have to get away and real life comes first.

02:29:51.744 --> 02:29:56.085
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought I saw something on LiveJournal.

02:30:21.417 --> 02:30:22.858
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

02:30:23.098 --> 02:30:24.379
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll take that discussion offline.

02:30:24.419 --> 02:30:25.560
[SPEAKER_03]: Meanwhile, explicit.

02:30:28.743 --> 02:30:41.052
[SPEAKER_18]: Grab the mic by the bottom because the cord's coming out a little bit and it's making a... Yeah, there, try that.

02:30:41.852 --> 02:30:42.193
[SPEAKER_03]: Talk now.

02:30:44.114 --> 02:30:47.637
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, it's still cutting out.

02:30:47.657 --> 02:30:48.958
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we get him that other microphone real quick?

02:30:49.098 --> 02:30:50.719
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, bud, I don't know what's going on with that.

02:30:53.052 --> 02:30:53.693
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead.

02:30:54.293 --> 02:30:56.115
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that one's really loud, so keep it away.

02:30:56.135 --> 02:30:56.395
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

02:30:56.555 --> 02:30:56.855
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

02:30:57.496 --> 02:31:12.608
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd like to say an F you to some asshole who opened a door off of a supermarket, opened the door, slams my car, leaves a big mark, but luckily I have his license plate number so I can go to the department and sue his ass.

02:31:14.510 --> 02:31:17.772
[SPEAKER_18]: If you're a webcam, I want to give him the middle finger.

02:31:19.093 --> 02:31:19.313
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

02:31:19.333 --> 02:31:19.834
[SPEAKER_18]: Middle finger.

02:31:21.716 --> 02:31:40.355
[SPEAKER_18]: F you for the turkey for being so dry I think the turkey would say F you I'm dead F you for Fries for having a very fucking long line

02:31:42.214 --> 02:31:43.775
[SPEAKER_04]: I completely forgot about that.

02:31:44.556 --> 02:31:49.279
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Fry's, so I get there, I go shopping on Black Friday, for God knows what reason.

02:31:49.740 --> 02:31:54.783
[SPEAKER_04]: I just decided, gee, you know, I don't think I've been fucked up the ass enough this week, let's go to Fry's.

02:31:55.244 --> 02:31:59.227
[SPEAKER_04]: So I go to Fry's, and their line wraps around the whole fucking store.

02:31:59.507 --> 02:32:01.248
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just... forever.

02:32:01.669 --> 02:32:05.471
[SPEAKER_04]: I, like, walk in line, I'm like, I'm all, damn, this line keeps going.

02:32:05.591 --> 02:32:10.235
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep walking, keep walking, keep walking, see far off in the distance, in the horizon...

02:32:10.783 --> 02:32:13.005
[SPEAKER_04]: A woman with balloons that says, end of line.

02:32:13.045 --> 02:32:15.166
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, ah, fuck it.

02:32:15.466 --> 02:32:17.267
[SPEAKER_04]: So then I had to make a judgment decision.

02:32:17.788 --> 02:32:21.110
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I want to buy the stuff that I couldn't find anywhere else?

02:32:21.310 --> 02:32:22.451
[SPEAKER_07]: Or run out the door.

02:32:22.531 --> 02:32:22.991
[SPEAKER_04]: Or leave.

02:32:23.692 --> 02:32:26.293
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wait, if I leave, I have to wait in line to get out of the store.

02:32:26.373 --> 02:32:28.235
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, it fucking sucks.

02:32:28.295 --> 02:32:28.715
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

02:32:28.775 --> 02:32:29.035
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway.

02:32:29.115 --> 02:32:35.059
[SPEAKER_18]: Everything what Loki said, except that the register saying, sorry, we closed the line.

02:32:35.139 --> 02:32:35.459
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

02:32:35.620 --> 02:32:35.980
[SPEAKER_18]: Bye-bye.

02:32:37.455 --> 02:32:41.276
[SPEAKER_18]: Just what I was about to buy in my $30, 512 megabyte RAM.

02:32:43.377 --> 02:32:43.937
[SPEAKER_20]: I need RAM.

02:32:44.817 --> 02:32:49.839
[SPEAKER_18]: Now I have to spend $90 or $120 just for it now, because it was a big ass sale at the time.

02:32:51.059 --> 02:32:52.760
[SPEAKER_18]: There goes one-fourth of the damn price.

02:32:54.020 --> 02:32:57.862
[SPEAKER_18]: And I have to get to Texas Hold'em for giving me some very, very shitty cards.

02:32:58.602 --> 02:32:58.722
[SPEAKER_18]: How...

02:32:59.830 --> 02:33:01.971
[SPEAKER_18]: Fuck you!

02:33:02.212 --> 02:33:04.653
[SPEAKER_03]: Islander pulled out the Texas Hold'em poker set.

02:33:05.033 --> 02:33:08.395
[SPEAKER_03]: Texas Hold'em Sacramento chapter is coming soon from what I hear.

02:33:08.755 --> 02:33:10.116
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's more like Texas Fuck'em.

02:33:13.218 --> 02:33:15.460
[SPEAKER_18]: How the hell can you win with three and two?

02:33:16.060 --> 02:33:17.181
[SPEAKER_18]: That's nearly impossible.

02:33:19.142 --> 02:33:19.462
[SPEAKER_18]: No.

02:33:20.122 --> 02:33:23.104
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

02:33:23.384 --> 02:33:24.285
[SPEAKER_03]: Three hour show.

02:33:24.325 --> 02:33:25.265
[SPEAKER_03]: Three hour show, guys.

02:33:25.305 --> 02:33:25.986
[SPEAKER_03]: Wrap it up.

02:33:28.416 --> 02:33:32.379
[SPEAKER_18]: and NFU4 losing my very rare European watch.

02:33:32.899 --> 02:33:34.520
[SPEAKER_18]: It's now gone, I don't wear it anymore.

02:33:34.540 --> 02:33:42.305
[SPEAKER_18]: NFU4 worked for miscalculating my hours and money I've actually earned the whole two weeks.

02:33:43.486 --> 02:33:47.248
[SPEAKER_18]: Damn it, I know I have $100 missing.

02:33:48.389 --> 02:33:49.750
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm like, what the fuck?

02:33:50.670 --> 02:33:53.112
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not going to come around getting slave labor now.

02:33:54.152 --> 02:33:54.533
[SPEAKER_18]: Shit.

02:33:57.174 --> 02:34:02.358
[SPEAKER_18]: and F you to the family for making the whole Thanksgiving all anti-American.

02:34:05.039 --> 02:34:06.840
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you make Thanksgiving anti-American?

02:34:07.761 --> 02:34:09.302
[SPEAKER_18]: The only American food was turkey.

02:34:12.504 --> 02:34:15.526
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought you meant like they were burning flags in the front yard or something.

02:34:20.816 --> 02:34:22.397
[SPEAKER_03]: Storytime, Islanders laughing.

02:34:22.577 --> 02:34:22.917
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up?

02:34:22.977 --> 02:34:23.457
[SPEAKER_03]: Storytime.

02:34:26.579 --> 02:34:27.499
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm stopping the music.

02:34:27.559 --> 02:34:29.120
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't take Captain Jack anymore.

02:34:29.140 --> 02:34:29.540
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

02:34:30.381 --> 02:34:33.302
[SPEAKER_08]: We're at Ross's sister's house.

02:34:33.742 --> 02:34:39.585
[SPEAKER_08]: And she's talking about how she was talking to this friend of hers, this co-worker of hers.

02:34:39.645 --> 02:34:42.467
[SPEAKER_08]: And she's like, oh, well, I don't know how to make green bean casserole.

02:34:42.887 --> 02:34:43.567
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, wait, no.

02:34:43.927 --> 02:34:46.989
[SPEAKER_08]: My little brother's girlfriend is going to be there.

02:34:47.289 --> 02:34:47.889
[SPEAKER_08]: She's white.

02:34:47.949 --> 02:34:48.990
[SPEAKER_08]: She'll know how to make it.

02:34:54.031 --> 02:34:58.052
[SPEAKER_08]: Since when is it a requirement of white people to know how to make green bean casserole?

02:34:58.553 --> 02:34:59.153
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm scared.

02:34:59.333 --> 02:35:02.974
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that mean I have to be deported because I don't know how to make, you know, casserole?

02:35:03.434 --> 02:35:05.195
[SPEAKER_08]: I eat black!

02:35:05.355 --> 02:35:05.955
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow!

02:35:08.196 --> 02:35:10.217
[SPEAKER_08]: I can make me some collard greens!

02:35:10.557 --> 02:35:11.937
[SPEAKER_25]: I can make hot pockets.

02:35:12.177 --> 02:35:13.858
[SPEAKER_25]: Does that count for anything?

02:35:13.898 --> 02:35:15.218
[SPEAKER_25]: Mac and cheese?

02:35:16.399 --> 02:35:17.039
[SPEAKER_03]: A hot pocket?

02:35:18.840 --> 02:35:21.261
[SPEAKER_04]: I eat a lot of pork and I like fried chicken.

02:35:21.321 --> 02:35:22.261
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that, you know...

02:35:23.812 --> 02:35:24.473
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I join the club?

02:35:25.613 --> 02:35:26.413
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, explicit.

02:35:26.914 --> 02:35:27.534
[SPEAKER_03]: Finish up your thought.

02:35:27.554 --> 02:35:28.895
[SPEAKER_03]: We gotta get to the chatroom FUs.

02:35:30.115 --> 02:35:35.838
[SPEAKER_18]: FU for people complaining about Ultramix 2 and yadda yadda butt stabs and such, such, such, such.

02:35:36.318 --> 02:35:42.140
[SPEAKER_18]: If you don't like those stabs, you can either edit the stabs by yourself, buy a memory card, or buy an Xbox edit.

02:35:43.041 --> 02:35:45.602
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm assuming that Ultramix 2 has edits to make, right?

02:35:46.602 --> 02:35:46.782
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

02:35:47.123 --> 02:35:47.463
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

02:35:47.983 --> 02:35:50.064
[SPEAKER_18]: Or you can go to Stumbadia and make your own shit.

02:35:50.939 --> 02:35:51.680
[SPEAKER_03]: Plain and simple.

02:35:51.840 --> 02:35:53.402
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure Konami loves hearing that.

02:35:53.502 --> 02:35:53.802
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:35:54.623 --> 02:35:54.883
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:35:55.223 --> 02:35:56.184
[SPEAKER_03]: We got to go to the chat room.

02:35:56.264 --> 02:35:56.405
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

02:35:56.425 --> 02:35:57.145
[SPEAKER_03]: To be continued.

02:35:57.165 --> 02:35:57.486
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:35:57.846 --> 02:35:58.366
[SPEAKER_03]: As usual.

02:35:58.427 --> 02:35:58.747
[SPEAKER_03]: Goody, goody.

02:35:58.787 --> 02:35:59.107
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:35:59.127 --> 02:35:59.988
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's bring the music back.

02:36:03.071 --> 02:36:04.613
[SPEAKER_03]: This is good chat room FU music.

02:36:07.816 --> 02:36:09.297
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

02:36:10.779 --> 02:36:12.340
[SPEAKER_03]: Misty says two words.

02:36:12.901 --> 02:36:13.662
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck fleeting.

02:36:16.525 --> 02:36:17.125
[SPEAKER_03]: Panda.

02:36:18.146 --> 02:36:19.446
[SPEAKER_13]: Amen.

02:36:19.466 --> 02:36:23.346
[SPEAKER_08]: A-freaking-men.

02:36:23.486 --> 02:36:26.547
[SPEAKER_03]: All the guys in the room just had the worst reaction to that.

02:36:26.567 --> 02:36:27.747
[SPEAKER_03]: That was amazing.

02:36:29.307 --> 02:36:33.188
[SPEAKER_03]: Panda just said, F you to Comcast for not working most of the time.

02:36:33.648 --> 02:36:36.949
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to my mom's friend for what I think is more than just a friend.

02:36:37.329 --> 02:36:38.269
[SPEAKER_03]: And F you to life.

02:36:40.509 --> 02:36:44.150
[SPEAKER_03]: Snowcat says, F you to broken teeth and having to go to the dentist in the morning.

02:36:44.210 --> 02:36:44.450
[SPEAKER_03]: Cry.

02:36:45.106 --> 02:36:45.386
[SPEAKER_13]: Yuck.

02:36:46.667 --> 02:36:52.770
[SPEAKER_03]: MPQ says, fuck Tekken 5 for being more important to local arcade goers than 2DX.

02:36:53.971 --> 02:36:54.671
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it is pretty.

02:36:55.812 --> 02:36:56.732
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty, but that's about it.

02:36:57.473 --> 02:37:05.157
[SPEAKER_03]: Illusion says, F you to my brother being a greedy bastard and not letting me use his Xbox to play Ultramix 2 more than a few days in a row.

02:37:06.217 --> 02:37:07.738
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you need to fix every day.

02:37:07.758 --> 02:37:08.778
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like heroin.

02:37:08.838 --> 02:37:09.659
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like heroin.

02:37:10.900 --> 02:37:11.720
[SPEAKER_08]: Tap the vein, baby.

02:37:12.722 --> 02:37:18.384
[SPEAKER_03]: Elmullet says F you in general to morons who complain about Ultramix 2 for the most asinine reasons.

02:37:18.885 --> 02:37:20.685
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up about the timing windows, guys.

02:37:20.865 --> 02:37:21.566
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't matter.

02:37:21.686 --> 02:37:23.206
[SPEAKER_03]: Just pick a song and have fun.

02:37:23.787 --> 02:37:24.187
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeesh.

02:37:25.467 --> 02:37:26.788
[SPEAKER_03]: And I quote, yeesh.

02:37:31.719 --> 02:37:34.600
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, sorry.

02:37:34.920 --> 02:37:38.581
[SPEAKER_03]: Jaded2004 says, F you to Loki for singing Britney Spears.

02:37:41.441 --> 02:37:43.402
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you be giving me the F you.

02:37:43.522 --> 02:37:44.262
[SPEAKER_04]: Blame Rob.

02:37:44.322 --> 02:37:47.003
[SPEAKER_13]: They're the ones that said, sing Britney Spears.

02:37:47.223 --> 02:37:48.823
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even want to play the game, okay?

02:37:50.604 --> 02:37:51.124
[SPEAKER_03]: Love you, Loki.

02:37:52.104 --> 02:37:56.045
[SPEAKER_03]: Jaded2004 also says, F you Michigan for having winters too cold.

02:37:57.176 --> 02:38:02.397
[SPEAKER_03]: Legend of Zaku says, F you to Chartwells, the food supplier for my campus, for making me gain 20 pounds.

02:38:02.677 --> 02:38:04.738
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because they forced you to eat all that food.

02:38:06.138 --> 02:38:06.858
[SPEAKER_03]: They forced you.

02:38:07.238 --> 02:38:07.618
[SPEAKER_16]: Freshman 15.

02:38:07.778 --> 02:38:10.959
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to my, or in my case, freshman 30.

02:38:11.019 --> 02:38:16.981
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to my campus for giving me a shitty apartment that leaks water from the ceilings when it rains heavily.

02:38:17.021 --> 02:38:18.061
[SPEAKER_03]: Now there we go, that's valid.

02:38:19.077 --> 02:38:22.599
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to having to give up my PlayStation so that it can be sent to Peru.

02:38:23.219 --> 02:38:29.082
[SPEAKER_03]: And F you to my shitty stamina contributed to my weight problem for giving me more greats and not enough perfects.

02:38:29.142 --> 02:38:29.782
[SPEAKER_03]: I hear you on that one.

02:38:31.483 --> 02:38:35.065
[SPEAKER_03]: MJB says my F you of the week goes to my goddamn hair cutress.

02:38:35.903 --> 02:38:44.767
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never heard a haircutress who cut my hair extremely short after I repeatedly told her to only trim it and not to cut it very much.

02:38:44.807 --> 02:38:45.727
[SPEAKER_03]: You goddamn bitch.

02:38:45.807 --> 02:38:47.608
[SPEAKER_03]: My friends don't even recognize me anymore.

02:38:47.668 --> 02:38:48.628
[SPEAKER_03]: My hair is so short.

02:38:48.968 --> 02:38:52.630
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you collapse, you stupid bitch.

02:38:55.051 --> 02:39:00.213
[SPEAKER_03]: Ziz says F you to Konami for making Ultramix 2's doubles sucks.

02:39:01.133 --> 02:39:02.054
[SPEAKER_03]: Suck, not sucks.

02:39:03.391 --> 02:39:09.956
[SPEAKER_03]: I changed my FU to FU to everyone at 8 on the break for being better than me and doing better in the tournament.

02:39:10.276 --> 02:39:11.337
[SPEAKER_03]: Being better in the group.

02:39:12.358 --> 02:39:16.401
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't send me a message that says I changed my FU because it doesn't work.

02:39:16.461 --> 02:39:17.542
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I read from the top down.

02:39:17.562 --> 02:39:20.044
[SPEAKER_03]: So you think before you hit that enter key, boys and girls.

02:39:21.825 --> 02:39:27.230
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Ranma S says I only got two lines of his.

02:39:27.290 --> 02:39:31.513
[SPEAKER_03]: Something about having the cash to pay for that damn cubic zirconia engagement ring.

02:39:33.988 --> 02:39:34.708
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I got.

02:39:36.629 --> 02:39:41.011
[SPEAKER_03]: Flareone says, F you to Konami of Hawaii's obsession with the dancing character Lady.

02:39:43.772 --> 02:39:45.072
[SPEAKER_04]: Where is slutty Emi?

02:39:45.192 --> 02:39:46.113
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I want to know.

02:39:48.914 --> 02:39:51.615
[SPEAKER_03]: DidiArcoholic says, F you for not having FUs.

02:39:51.855 --> 02:39:53.296
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to Loki for yelling at me.

02:39:53.856 --> 02:39:56.057
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to not having enough time to come down to the show with you guys.

02:39:56.457 --> 02:39:59.078
[SPEAKER_03]: And F you to Loki for yelling at me for actually having FUs.

02:40:00.965 --> 02:40:04.731
[SPEAKER_03]: and JazzSaysFUtoWindowsServicePack2 for eating my windows.

02:40:11.314 --> 02:40:17.739
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Ranma S got cut off, so I feel bad for him, but he might send it in, and then we'll figure that out.

02:40:17.819 --> 02:40:19.560
[SPEAKER_03]: He says he's going to resend, so we'll see.

02:40:20.141 --> 02:40:22.062
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's too long, though, I'm cutting it short.

02:40:22.562 --> 02:40:27.706
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we're going to go to a break, and when we come back, let's give away some MIDI Head CDs, and play some MIDI Head songs as well.

02:40:27.786 --> 02:40:29.147
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that sounds like a plan.

02:40:29.367 --> 02:40:29.688
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

02:40:30.568 --> 02:40:34.211
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's play some stuff from, I don't know, what sounds good to you guys?

02:40:34.251 --> 02:40:36.513
[SPEAKER_03]: How about some poppin'?

02:40:36.533 --> 02:40:37.574
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

02:40:38.534 --> 02:40:39.375
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do some poppin'.

02:40:39.495 --> 02:40:40.536
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to hear some Goonies.

02:40:41.618 --> 02:40:42.324
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do Goonies.

02:40:42.445 --> 02:40:43.635
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be back after this break.

02:42:24.703 --> 02:42:25.424
[SPEAKER_13]: and many more.

02:43:03.080 --> 02:43:04.046
Thanks for watching!

02:43:34.203 --> 02:43:34.969
Thanks for watching!

02:44:22.443 --> 02:44:32.150
[SPEAKER_22]: please listen to Orange Lounge Radio because real radio makes Captain Jack cry we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio

02:44:36.329 --> 02:44:42.231
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we're going to do is we're going to give away some of those MIDI head CDs.

02:44:42.251 --> 02:44:44.012
[SPEAKER_03]: He's releasing them under the name Monolithic.

02:44:44.452 --> 02:44:49.093
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's all down to Iguana Girl and Islander, our buddies from DDR Freak.

02:44:49.113 --> 02:44:51.834
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to be picking the winners inadvertently in their own little way.

02:44:52.234 --> 02:44:56.116
[SPEAKER_03]: I just need you on that little slip of paper to write a number between one and this many.

02:44:58.997 --> 02:45:00.897
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, write a number between one and that many.

02:45:03.118 --> 02:45:03.458
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:45:05.179 --> 02:45:08.662
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to find out who won some free stuff.

02:45:11.825 --> 02:45:12.406
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, you guys ready?

02:45:12.446 --> 02:45:13.847
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you guys didn't put down the same number.

02:45:14.307 --> 02:45:14.688
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, good.

02:45:15.228 --> 02:45:17.170
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Iguana Girl, what number did you put?

02:45:17.550 --> 02:45:18.751
[SPEAKER_03]: Number seven.

02:45:18.791 --> 02:45:19.412
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

02:45:19.552 --> 02:45:22.115
[SPEAKER_03]: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

02:45:22.195 --> 02:45:25.518
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks like Rychan won our first CD.

02:45:25.558 --> 02:45:26.859
[SPEAKER_03]: He's going to win a free MIDI head CD.

02:45:26.899 --> 02:45:27.560
[SPEAKER_03]: Good job, Rychan.

02:45:27.580 --> 02:45:28.340
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be contacting you.

02:45:28.781 --> 02:45:30.302
[SPEAKER_03]: And Islander, what's your number?

02:45:31.043 --> 02:45:31.263
[SPEAKER_01]: Six.

02:45:32.166 --> 02:45:36.250
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we're going to give that one to Legend of Zaku on that one.

02:45:36.330 --> 02:45:37.211
[SPEAKER_03]: So good job, guys.

02:45:37.732 --> 02:45:38.592
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations.

02:45:39.493 --> 02:45:40.975
[SPEAKER_03]: More free stuff in the future.

02:45:41.035 --> 02:45:50.664
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, if you want to try and get some stuff from Midihead's site, you can always visit his site, www.midihead.com, and he's doing some download stuff.

02:45:50.704 --> 02:45:51.525
[SPEAKER_03]: So go beg.

02:45:51.665 --> 02:45:55.709
[SPEAKER_03]: Go beg and plead and just prod around the site.

02:45:57.062 --> 02:45:58.003
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, good job you guys.

02:45:58.083 --> 02:46:02.687
[SPEAKER_03]: They're celebrating in chat right now.

02:46:02.727 --> 02:46:03.767
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be contacting you guys.

02:46:03.847 --> 02:46:04.828
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't call us, we'll call you.

02:46:04.928 --> 02:46:08.291
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do need to get your addresses in a little bit, so we'll be contacting you shortly.

02:46:09.272 --> 02:46:09.652
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

02:46:12.054 --> 02:46:12.454
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

02:46:12.554 --> 02:46:14.436
[SPEAKER_03]: How about some Ask Orange Lounge, you guys?

02:46:15.458 --> 02:46:16.178
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a little time here.

02:46:16.198 --> 02:46:17.799
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to open up the Skype line as well.

02:46:17.819 --> 02:46:22.660
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys want to call in over on www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on Interact With Us.

02:46:22.700 --> 02:46:28.102
[SPEAKER_03]: But first, I have to get some FUs of the Week in, some that got forgotten there.

02:46:28.182 --> 02:46:33.004
[SPEAKER_03]: Sigurd tried to send me an FU of the Week three times, and I don't know why, but it's broken.

02:46:33.064 --> 02:46:33.724
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't work right.

02:46:34.084 --> 02:46:36.645
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's broken.

02:46:37.025 --> 02:46:42.187
[SPEAKER_03]: But he had some choice words for some of the people complaining about the game he worked on.

02:46:43.208 --> 02:46:44.308
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's just leave it at that.

02:46:45.942 --> 02:46:49.423
[SPEAKER_03]: I told him I would call him, but he doesn't want to.

02:46:49.924 --> 02:46:50.364
[SPEAKER_03]: He's shy.

02:46:51.344 --> 02:46:52.745
[SPEAKER_03]: But DJ Ranma S had another one.

02:46:52.785 --> 02:46:56.366
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, a giant F you to that stupid bitch that whined about the Black Friday sale.

02:46:56.446 --> 02:46:58.507
[SPEAKER_03]: Another F you to the lady who called me lazy.

02:46:58.827 --> 02:47:00.928
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I flipped you off in front of everyone there.

02:47:01.308 --> 02:47:04.229
[SPEAKER_03]: And finally, a giant F you to my former roommate for getting married.

02:47:04.289 --> 02:47:10.491
[SPEAKER_03]: By the time I'm done with suing your ass for throwing my shit out, you won't have the cash to pay for that damn cubic zirconia engagement ring.

02:47:10.952 --> 02:47:12.172
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay, there we go.

02:47:12.212 --> 02:47:13.112
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that was a ring.

02:47:13.853 --> 02:47:14.533
[SPEAKER_08]: That makes sense.

02:47:16.211 --> 02:47:17.132
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, good deal.

02:47:17.972 --> 02:47:25.737
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so if you guys have a question for Ask Orange Lounge, you can just send that on in over private message to Sky right now.

02:47:25.777 --> 02:47:27.898
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me just type that in chat there.

02:47:27.958 --> 02:47:32.641
[SPEAKER_03]: Or can you tell them how to send me a message, if you wouldn't mind?

02:47:32.861 --> 02:47:33.561
[SPEAKER_03]: In case they don't know.

02:47:34.382 --> 02:47:36.683
[SPEAKER_03]: Meanwhile, we've got the theme music we've got to do here.

02:47:38.083 --> 02:47:43.227
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're also going to take calls over Skype for this as well, if you guys want to call in our Skype line there.

02:47:43.928 --> 02:47:44.588
[SPEAKER_03]: Type, type, type.

02:47:54.949 --> 02:47:57.892
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

02:47:58.412 --> 02:48:01.635
[SPEAKER_03]: What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

02:48:02.195 --> 02:48:05.378
[SPEAKER_03]: One question I'd like to know is why is Loki so bitter?

02:48:05.778 --> 02:48:09.021
[SPEAKER_03]: He threw a fit and now I'm afraid he's going to kill me in my sleep.

02:48:15.487 --> 02:48:15.967
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:48:17.850 --> 02:48:23.134
[SPEAKER_03]: First question for Ask Orange Lounge is, actually we don't have any yet because there's a delay.

02:48:23.575 --> 02:48:25.516
[SPEAKER_03]: And I forgot to announce this before the previous break.

02:48:25.536 --> 02:48:27.578
[SPEAKER_03]: So we don't have any questions over private message just yet.

02:48:27.958 --> 02:48:31.301
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was going to open it up if anybody else had any questions for anyone else.

02:48:34.123 --> 02:48:34.523
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything?

02:48:34.823 --> 02:48:35.164
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything?

02:48:35.484 --> 02:48:37.145
[SPEAKER_16]: They're too busy playing DS.

02:48:38.766 --> 02:48:40.528
[SPEAKER_03]: DDR Angel, I have a question for you then.

02:48:41.548 --> 02:48:45.531
[SPEAKER_03]: Why the F did you come over here if you're just going to play DS all night?

02:48:47.173 --> 02:48:49.555
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm fully paying attention, Mr. Man.

02:48:49.655 --> 02:48:50.155
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just teasing.

02:48:50.195 --> 02:48:52.117
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm giving you a hard time.

02:48:52.377 --> 02:48:52.917
[SPEAKER_03]: Where have you been?

02:48:52.957 --> 02:48:54.239
[SPEAKER_03]: Just busy with school and stuff?

02:48:54.439 --> 02:49:00.744
[SPEAKER_09]: Busy with school and couldn't get rides and stuff, so, you know, stuff happens.

02:49:01.705 --> 02:49:09.311
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm here this week, and hopefully I can come the next couple weeks, and it'll be just like old times.

02:49:10.256 --> 02:49:10.877
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds good to me.

02:49:10.937 --> 02:49:13.338
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, now we're getting some questions from chat.

02:49:14.359 --> 02:49:17.902
[SPEAKER_03]: MPQ wants to know, why does Bomani suck so much in this state?

02:49:18.782 --> 02:49:21.744
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what state he lives in, so it's a little hard for me to comment.

02:49:22.865 --> 02:49:30.551
[SPEAKER_03]: I could assume he lives in, I don't know... I guess, or... Because I don't read minds, unfortunately.

02:49:30.651 --> 02:49:33.313
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I could guess, but I think he said he was on the East Coast.

02:49:33.333 --> 02:49:34.834
[SPEAKER_08]: Because your state has it out for you.

02:49:37.346 --> 02:49:38.326
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, he says Washington.

02:49:38.406 --> 02:49:44.248
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't Washington where GameWorks is and all the Seattle people that have a lot of good stuff up there?

02:49:45.248 --> 02:49:46.309
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe he doesn't live near there.

02:49:46.349 --> 02:49:46.729
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

02:49:47.069 --> 02:49:49.730
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's the blanket answer for that question.

02:49:49.770 --> 02:49:54.011
[SPEAKER_03]: If you think the state of Bomani sucks in your state, buy the home mixes.

02:49:54.431 --> 02:49:55.171
[SPEAKER_03]: There's one option.

02:49:55.411 --> 02:49:58.432
[SPEAKER_03]: They put those out for a reason so you can play in the comfort of your own home.

02:49:58.452 --> 02:50:04.774
[SPEAKER_03]: If you still don't like it, get some of your friends together, professionally approach the management at your local arcade and say, hey,

02:50:05.294 --> 02:50:12.944
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got an idea for a game that would bring you guys money and emphasize money and visiting frequently.

02:50:13.345 --> 02:50:16.989
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you don't like the situation, you can take control in your own hands and do something about it.

02:50:17.871 --> 02:50:19.393
[SPEAKER_03]: So just a thought for you guys.

02:50:21.756 --> 02:50:22.016
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:50:22.401 --> 02:50:25.082
[SPEAKER_03]: Dark Knight says, what are your guys' Christmas wishes this year?

02:50:49.749 --> 02:50:51.210
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody care to answer a Christmas wish?

02:50:51.610 --> 02:50:53.271
[SPEAKER_20]: I wish for world peace.

02:50:54.612 --> 02:50:55.593
[SPEAKER_20]: I need new clothes.

02:50:55.753 --> 02:50:56.513
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to get laid.

02:50:57.094 --> 02:50:57.514
Just kidding.

02:50:58.815 --> 02:51:06.219
[SPEAKER_03]: No, my Christmas wish is just, I would like to just have enough time to hang out with all my friends.

02:51:06.259 --> 02:51:07.200
[SPEAKER_03]: I want a lot of parties.

02:51:07.300 --> 02:51:08.580
[SPEAKER_03]: I want a lot of holiday parties.

02:51:08.660 --> 02:51:09.841
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my Christmas wish.

02:51:09.961 --> 02:51:10.842
[SPEAKER_03]: I want holiday parties.

02:51:11.522 --> 02:51:13.883
[SPEAKER_03]: And that can be Christmas, New Year's, and year-round, really.

02:51:13.924 --> 02:51:14.944
[SPEAKER_03]: Just throw parties all year-round.

02:51:15.645 --> 02:51:16.045
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

02:51:16.365 --> 02:51:18.126
[SPEAKER_03]: Angel, did you have something you wanted to add to that, your Christmas wish?

02:51:18.956 --> 02:51:19.496
[SPEAKER_09]: I got mine.

02:51:21.237 --> 02:51:21.677
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, what's that?

02:51:21.697 --> 02:51:35.842
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, DS, but, uh, I already got it, and, well, I don't really know what I want besides, uh, the Karaoke Revolution 2 and 3, which I haven't gotten yet, and, uh, Ultra Mix 2.

02:51:37.863 --> 02:51:42.485
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, the rest has to come later, because it's more expensive, like, uh, Ace Style and, uh, 10th

02:51:44.926 --> 02:51:46.628
[SPEAKER_03]: I do really want 8th style and poppin' 10.

02:51:46.688 --> 02:51:47.789
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just going to be a little while there.

02:51:48.789 --> 02:51:49.230
[SPEAKER_03]: What can you do?

02:51:50.270 --> 02:51:52.532
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody else want to share anything they want for Christmas this year?

02:51:53.433 --> 02:51:54.554
[SPEAKER_06]: I need clothes.

02:51:55.555 --> 02:51:58.657
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, certificates to any store would be nice, like Target.

02:52:02.280 --> 02:52:02.660
[SPEAKER_03]: Exquisite.

02:52:03.481 --> 02:52:04.502
[SPEAKER_18]: Anything priceless.

02:52:05.642 --> 02:52:06.984
[SPEAKER_18]: Another bumper for my car.

02:52:07.864 --> 02:52:08.385
[SPEAKER_18]: Ha ha ha ha!

02:52:10.334 --> 02:52:14.538
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like lessons for all those who can't drive.

02:52:14.698 --> 02:52:17.420
[SPEAKER_03]: That is my Christmas wish.

02:52:19.221 --> 02:52:21.123
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we have a question from Illusion.

02:52:21.843 --> 02:52:22.624
[SPEAKER_04]: This is great.

02:52:23.284 --> 02:52:23.945
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen to this one.

02:52:24.685 --> 02:52:28.708
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you deal with Sigurd's sweet ass anytime he comes on?

02:52:29.489 --> 02:52:31.451
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it hard keeping your hands off of it?

02:52:33.712 --> 02:52:34.133
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

02:52:35.534 --> 02:52:36.054
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

02:52:36.094 --> 02:52:37.075
[SPEAKER_03]: Sigurd's just a friend.

02:52:38.729 --> 02:52:40.650
[SPEAKER_03]: You know he's just a friend.

02:52:41.010 --> 02:52:47.172
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, baby, you got what I need.

02:52:48.293 --> 02:52:51.013
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you want to grab your brother's sweet ass?

02:52:51.374 --> 02:52:52.194
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

02:52:52.334 --> 02:52:54.455
[SPEAKER_08]: You may if you live in Alabama.

02:52:55.235 --> 02:52:58.536
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have these sweet ass feelings towards Sigurd.

02:52:58.916 --> 02:53:00.837
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have sweet ass Sigurd feelings, one girl?

02:53:01.725 --> 02:53:02.746
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't, I'm sorry.

02:53:03.327 --> 02:53:06.589
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that's going to be heartbreaking for him, but I don't.

02:53:07.410 --> 02:53:07.770
[SPEAKER_03]: Islander?

02:53:07.950 --> 02:53:08.411
[SPEAKER_03]: Never have.

02:53:09.111 --> 02:53:11.093
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, how do you resist Sigurd's sweet ass?

02:53:12.074 --> 02:53:13.235
[SPEAKER_04]: Quite easily, I'm straight.

02:53:17.819 --> 02:53:18.699
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, moving on.

02:53:20.000 --> 02:53:23.843
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Ranma S says, do you guys want a holiday card for me?

02:53:24.604 --> 02:53:24.824
Yes.

02:53:25.885 --> 02:53:27.166
[SPEAKER_03]: Certainly, of course we want a holiday.

02:53:27.206 --> 02:53:28.187
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll put it up on our wall.

02:53:28.427 --> 02:53:29.228
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a little wall here.

02:53:29.921 --> 02:53:31.482
[SPEAKER_03]: Legend of Zaku says, you're on that DDR diet, right?

02:53:31.502 --> 02:53:32.983
[SPEAKER_03]: Legend of Zaku says, you're on that DDR diet, right?

02:53:59.907 --> 02:54:06.412
[SPEAKER_03]: I need help planning a regimen for dropping 20 pounds, aka what songs and or Oni courses must I do to really start shedding weight?

02:54:07.344 --> 02:54:08.685
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, here's my honest answer to the question.

02:54:08.705 --> 02:54:11.446
[SPEAKER_03]: There's really no set songs or choruses to do.

02:54:11.506 --> 02:54:13.347
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no, like, super weight loss plan.

02:54:13.687 --> 02:54:16.549
[SPEAKER_03]: My suggestion is if you're going to play non-stops, play the long ones.

02:54:16.669 --> 02:54:21.031
[SPEAKER_03]: Play 7 to 10, because the more you take breaks in between songs, the less your cardio is going to go.

02:54:21.331 --> 02:54:22.912
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the main thing is cardio.

02:54:22.972 --> 02:54:27.094
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to focus on doing at least a good 20 minutes of non-stop cardio.

02:54:27.454 --> 02:54:31.937
[SPEAKER_08]: Even if that means doing something as simple as just, you know, a basic endless.

02:54:32.217 --> 02:54:34.358
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, even then you're going to be burning calories.

02:54:34.978 --> 02:54:35.598
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

02:54:55.583 --> 02:54:56.004
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

02:55:13.113 --> 02:55:16.035
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be my suggestion if you really want more exercise.

02:55:16.055 --> 02:55:20.437
[SPEAKER_03]: Because DDR, it gives you a really good workout, but, you know, I think you can enhance it.

02:55:20.457 --> 02:55:22.278
[SPEAKER_03]: You can make it better by doing other little things, too.

02:55:22.298 --> 02:55:26.940
[SPEAKER_08]: Buy, like, a little set of those mini five-pound hand weights or something like that.

02:55:27.340 --> 02:55:27.660
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.

02:55:27.700 --> 02:55:28.501
[SPEAKER_08]: And work out with those.

02:55:29.641 --> 02:55:31.542
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

02:55:31.862 --> 02:55:33.603
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

02:55:33.623 --> 02:55:36.144
[SPEAKER_06]: To be honest, I was going to say, if you have a Max 3, I'll play Pop 8.

02:55:37.125 --> 02:55:41.367
[SPEAKER_03]: Dojo Max says, when will DDR Max 3 come out?

02:55:42.111 --> 02:55:44.531
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard Naoki is producing it in a secret basement.

02:55:44.611 --> 02:55:45.172
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this true?

02:55:47.112 --> 02:55:48.592
[SPEAKER_03]: Chances are, no, that's not true.

02:55:48.792 --> 02:55:53.353
[SPEAKER_03]: We would probably... Don't believe anything unless we report it.

02:55:53.433 --> 02:55:53.533
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

02:55:54.073 --> 02:55:58.934
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless Konami's official site says something, there's really nothing you can do.

02:55:59.634 --> 02:56:00.494
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all speculation.

02:56:00.854 --> 02:56:04.255
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do think if a new DDR at this point comes out, it's not going to be called Max 3.

02:56:04.775 --> 02:56:05.775
[SPEAKER_03]: It will be called something else.

02:56:06.115 --> 02:56:07.656
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Max 3 was extreme.

02:56:07.956 --> 02:56:09.436
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you missed DDR Extreme, but...

02:56:10.546 --> 02:56:13.848
[SPEAKER_03]: I think if they do do a new DDR, honestly, here's my suggestion.

02:56:15.148 --> 02:56:17.009
[SPEAKER_03]: Konami, if you're listening, feel free to take this.

02:56:18.270 --> 02:56:21.511
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to do a new DDR, you're going to do a new hardware thing, right?

02:56:21.591 --> 02:56:26.133
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're probably going to spice it up a little bit, make it a little more like 2DX, like bigger, badder, better thing, right?

02:56:26.413 --> 02:56:27.454
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's my suggestion.

02:56:28.014 --> 02:56:29.374
[SPEAKER_03]: Dance Dance Revolution 2.

02:56:35.297 --> 02:56:36.137
[SPEAKER_03]: It's as simple as that.

02:56:36.657 --> 02:56:37.718
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, interesting name.

02:56:38.991 --> 02:56:41.712
[SPEAKER_03]: Just Dance Dance Revolution 2.

02:56:41.812 --> 02:56:44.874
[SPEAKER_03]: Question on behalf of Dark Child through DDArcoholic.

02:56:45.194 --> 02:56:46.675
[SPEAKER_03]: And this will be the last question for tonight, you guys.

02:56:47.015 --> 02:56:50.457
[SPEAKER_03]: If Dark Child was gay, would Sky sleep with him?

02:56:52.878 --> 02:56:53.118
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

02:56:53.779 --> 02:56:56.420
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, that's going to do it for Ask Orange Lounge tonight.

02:56:56.460 --> 02:57:00.182
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you guys very much for your questions tonight and participating.

02:57:01.010 --> 02:57:06.235
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought, but not before we get in a plug for the rest of the week's programming.

02:57:06.576 --> 02:57:11.681
[SPEAKER_03]: Monday night, tune in to Diversion, the Orange Lounge Radio remix show, right here on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:57:11.721 --> 02:57:17.006
[SPEAKER_03]: All your favorite Bomani remixes, official, fan-made ones, and yes, remixes done in Acid are okay.

02:57:17.227 --> 02:57:18.027
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay!

02:57:18.087 --> 02:57:19.469
[SPEAKER_03]: Tuesday night, Dark Sakura.

02:57:19.489 --> 02:57:24.354
[SPEAKER_03]: I do believe she's back this Tuesday, and she's going to be doing... She's not going to be back until way late, though.

02:57:24.574 --> 02:57:28.557
[SPEAKER_03]: So, there'll be a rerun of Pump Up the Volume, ready to go.

02:57:28.677 --> 02:57:30.678
[SPEAKER_03]: So, likely we're going to get a rerun of Pump Up the Volume.

02:57:30.698 --> 02:57:36.383
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's a good show, and you should tune in, you know, and check out what it's all about if you haven't listened before, because it'll be new to you.

02:57:36.803 --> 02:57:39.425
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Tuesday nights, about 7.30, Pump Up the Volume.

02:57:40.265 --> 02:57:43.628
[SPEAKER_03]: Thursday nights, I'm sorry, Wednesday nights are the classic episodes of Orange Lingerie.

02:57:43.648 --> 02:57:53.455
[SPEAKER_03]: Thursday nights, myself, Rice Princess, and LikeyStyle, we're back from our Thanksgiving holiday this week with Outside the Box, all that other video gaming chat that doesn't quite fit into the Bomani Spectrum.

02:57:54.096 --> 02:57:59.318
[SPEAKER_03]: and then Friday night over on the Freak or DDR Freak Radio Orange Lounge Radio Rewind.

02:57:59.738 --> 02:58:03.639
[SPEAKER_03]: Hear the same shit over again but it's just as good the second time you guys.

02:58:04.439 --> 02:58:05.740
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially when you missed some of it.

02:58:05.800 --> 02:58:07.020
[SPEAKER_08]: That filling tastes great.

02:58:07.160 --> 02:58:07.300
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

02:58:08.160 --> 02:58:12.822
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so that's it for the programming and now we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought.

02:58:12.862 --> 02:58:14.862
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll start with Islander because he has a microphone over there.

02:58:17.663 --> 02:58:18.463
[SPEAKER_06]: Final thoughts.

02:58:19.784 --> 02:58:21.024
[SPEAKER_06]: Quit your bitching and just accept it.

02:58:22.845 --> 02:58:23.165
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

02:58:23.365 --> 02:58:23.865
[SPEAKER_03]: Very stern.

02:58:25.442 --> 02:58:26.323
[SPEAKER_03]: Angel, your final thought.

02:58:28.365 --> 02:58:29.526
[SPEAKER_09]: Mario sucks.

02:58:30.166 --> 02:58:30.727
[SPEAKER_09]: No, just kidding.

02:58:31.728 --> 02:58:33.289
[SPEAKER_03]: Aguana Girl, your final thought.

02:58:35.210 --> 02:58:37.793
[SPEAKER_08]: I really want to know what's wrong with my car, please.

02:58:39.854 --> 02:58:40.355
[SPEAKER_05]: Exquisite.

02:58:42.056 --> 02:58:48.001
[SPEAKER_18]: Drivers must get... Stupid drivers must get the actual driver how to drive.

02:58:49.142 --> 02:58:50.603
[SPEAKER_18]: God motherfucking dammit.

02:58:51.604 --> 02:58:52.545
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, your final thought.

02:58:54.704 --> 02:59:12.295
[SPEAKER_04]: Go to midihead.com, buy the albums, and you get access to this kickass shit that I'm downloading right now, which is more songs, not on his site, including the one that didn't win last week's, or not last week, a couple weeks ago's cage match, Speed Demons on there, but a lot of other ones.

02:59:13.456 --> 02:59:17.158
[SPEAKER_04]: All on there for you lucky people that purchase albums.

02:59:18.258 --> 02:59:23.400
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of Midi Head, and I'm so glad you mentioned it, stay tuned after the credits, because we're going to be playing that other Midi Head song.

02:59:23.440 --> 02:59:25.941
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you liked that last one, you've got to check out this other new one.

02:59:25.981 --> 02:59:27.242
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an unreleased track, I believe.

02:59:27.282 --> 02:59:28.182
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called Deeper and Deeper.

02:59:28.202 --> 02:59:30.103
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we're going to be hearing after the show.

02:59:32.944 --> 02:59:39.527
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to mention that that track is inside the little special members area if you purchase an album.

02:59:40.729 --> 02:59:41.830
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there you go.

02:59:42.190 --> 02:59:42.510
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:59:43.210 --> 02:59:44.951
[SPEAKER_03]: So have a great night, everybody.

02:59:44.991 --> 02:59:46.272
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much for listening.

02:59:46.492 --> 02:59:51.715
[SPEAKER_03]: The fortune cookie message is an oldie but goodie tonight because I didn't get a new one from DarkSakura, unfortunately.

02:59:51.735 --> 02:59:52.695
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is a good one.

02:59:52.755 --> 02:59:54.256
[SPEAKER_03]: So you guys will enjoy tonight's fortune cookie message.

02:59:54.596 --> 02:59:58.278
[SPEAKER_03]: The final word of the show goes to Islander.

02:59:59.739 --> 03:00:00.059
[SPEAKER_03]: One word.

03:00:00.139 --> 03:00:00.600
[SPEAKER_03]: Sum it all up.

03:00:04.582 --> 03:00:05.122
[SPEAKER_06]: Orgasmic.

03:00:06.204 --> 03:00:11.067
[SPEAKER_22]: That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

03:00:11.908 --> 03:00:16.110
[SPEAKER_22]: Orange Lounge Radio Live is an Orange Lounge Radio production.

03:00:16.611 --> 03:00:28.899

03:00:30.200 --> 03:00:31.901
[SPEAKER_25]: We love Japanese tourists.

03:00:34.062 --> 03:00:39.205
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey folks, this was CJ Radio presenting you Captain Jack's Greatest Summer Hits.

03:00:39.846 --> 03:00:46.350
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep the spirit, the sun is shining wherever you are, and don't forget, copy kills music.

03:00:46.410 --> 03:00:49.432
[SPEAKER_00]: So, don't copy, buy our records.

03:00:49.712 --> 03:00:52.314
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye bye, the party never ends.

03:00:56.517 --> 03:00:59.999
