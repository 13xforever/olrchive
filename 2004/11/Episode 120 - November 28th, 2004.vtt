Muh, uh, muh, uh, muh, cocky.

We do have in the other corner, our tech master Loki, I hate you already, the listeners don't

02:25.020 --> 02:31.240
know what I have planned for tonight, listeners, tell Loki to listen to me, listen to what

02:31.240 --> 02:38.120
I have to say because I know what's good for him and I know what's good for the show, anyway.

02:38.120 --> 02:43.380
We don't have Darkstacker here with us tonight and there's no way in hell, in good decency

02:43.380 --> 02:47.900
that anybody in the Bomani community would subject you to a Loki and Sky solo show. Some

02:47.900 --> 02:53.300
kind guests have volunteered to fill in tonight. Please welcome from our friends over at DDR

02:53.300 --> 02:58.340
Freak, Iguana Girl! Hello everybody! I'm so glad we could get a female perspective on

02:58.340 --> 03:03.340

I am so excited about this.

03:58.400 --> 04:02.280

And yet nobody knows

05:13.520 --> 05:15.520
Diddle-daddle, shake and chat

05:15.520 --> 05:17.520
Shoots in the breeze

05:17.520 --> 05:20.520
Puddles, clacks, cadence, letters

05:20.520 --> 05:23.520
There's a synchronous symphony

05:28.520 --> 05:31.520
Play from the familiar

05:31.520 --> 05:33.520
Kinda a synergise

05:33.520 --> 05:36.520
Fidget in the mind

05:36.520 --> 05:39.520
Enjoy cats with no regrets

05:39.520 --> 05:42.520
Analyzing, hallucinations

05:42.520 --> 05:44.520
Windows licking the imagination

05:44.520 --> 05:47.520
Big incisions, shadows missing

05:47.520 --> 05:50.520
Here's a synchronous symphony

05:55.520 --> 05:57.520
Diddle daddle, change hats

05:57.520 --> 05:59.520
Shoots in the breeze

05:59.520 --> 06:02.520
Pat-a-clack, cadence slatters

06:02.520 --> 06:05.520
Here's a synchronous symphony

06:05.520 --> 06:12.520
And that's the end of the video, thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next one.

06:35.520 --> 06:58.520
I'm holding on to all my fading memories Back to where it all began

06:58.520 --> 07:02.020
So much there I understand

07:02.020 --> 07:05.020
As I look now

07:05.020 --> 07:09.020
To a distance far away

07:09.020 --> 07:12.020
I will cross familiar lines

07:12.020 --> 07:15.520
Now I'm standing still in time

07:15.520 --> 07:18.520
Still in time

07:18.520 --> 07:22.020
Still in time

07:22.020 --> 07:25.520
Still in time

07:25.520 --> 07:29.520
And we're still in time

07:29.520 --> 07:59.200
Close your eyes, close your eyes and let it fly

07:59.200 --> 08:06.200
You and I, together we can touch the sky

08:07.200 --> 08:10.200
I was walking down the street

08:10.200 --> 08:13.200
You came like the summer breeze

08:13.200 --> 08:17.200
Sweeping my breath away

08:17.200 --> 08:20.200
It doesn't happen every day

08:21.200 --> 08:24.200
You and I together in the sky

08:24.200 --> 08:27.200
Forever young, we can never die

08:27.200 --> 08:34.200
Close your eyes, close your eyes and let us fly

08:34.200 --> 08:41.200
You and I, together we can touch the sky

08:41.200 --> 08:44.200
Close your eyes

08:44.200 --> 09:02.200
Close your eyes, close your eyes, close your eyes and let us fly

09:02.200 --> 09:09.200
You and I, together we can touch the sky

09:09.200 --> 09:15.700
Close your eyes, and let us fly

09:16.200 --> 09:18.200
You and I

09:19.200 --> 09:22.200
Together we can touch the sky

09:22.700 --> 09:29.200
Close your eyes, and let us fly

09:29.200 --> 09:32.200
You and I

09:32.200 --> 10:00.600
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 120 in progress, and our friends over

10:00.600 --> 10:06.320
at Step Squad, sending us that little shout out there, that shout out is about two years

10:06.320 --> 10:07.720
old, we need to get a new one.

10:07.720 --> 10:11.000
We need to get a new Step Squad family gathering.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.820
And what is Step Squad for those not in the know, because I know you're a member of Step

10:13.820 --> 10:14.820
Squad.

10:14.820 --> 10:22.380
Step Squad, it actually isn't really technically a DDR team per se, but it is at the same time.

10:22.380 --> 10:29.000
It's more of a friends that were brought together by things like the money and anime, it just

10:29.000 --> 10:33.560
has a very DDR tone. So it's not one of those like teams oh my god's lol gonna

10:33.560 --> 10:38.080
kick your butt? Yeah, no it's not all about oh my god we have to win over you

10:38.080 --> 10:45.840
no it's you know of course we take pride in in our wins but it's not all DDR to

10:45.840 --> 10:49.460
us it's more about family than anything. Very cool, very cool. Well welcome

10:49.460 --> 10:52.440

10:52.440 --> 10:57.880

some for those of you that don't know what Bomani is that is the music gaming

11:00.940 --> 11:04.580
fusion series put out by Konami so of course we talk a lot about other types

11:04.580 --> 11:08.380
of video games and other types of music and any randomness that we feel like so

11:08.380 --> 11:11.900

11:29.580 --> 11:33.420
anyway one of the weird things we like to do we like to start off every show by

11:33.420 --> 11:37.380
going around asking everybody how was your week how was your day a chance for

11:37.380 --> 11:40.820
you guys at home to catch up with us and listen to what we've been doing this

11:40.820 --> 11:44.340

11:44.340 --> 11:49.460
also if you want to participate in the show go on to our chat room www.orangelandtrainer.com

11:49.460 --> 11:53.500
click on chat now since Jamie usually starts us off she's not here tonight so

11:53.500 --> 11:56.460
I'm just going to turn to the person that's sitting in her chair right now.

11:56.460 --> 11:57.980
I am the Jamie.

11:57.980 --> 11:59.700
Does she know that you're sitting in her chair?

11:59.700 --> 12:01.220
No, not at all.

12:01.220 --> 12:02.340
And burping out?

12:02.340 --> 12:04.420
And burping in her honor.

12:04.420 --> 12:05.420
Alright.

12:05.420 --> 12:07.060
Uh, Iguana Girl, why don't you start us off?

12:07.060 --> 12:08.060
How was your week?

12:08.060 --> 12:09.060
How was your day?

12:09.060 --> 12:12.680
Um, my week was actually pretty good because I only had to go to school for two whole days

12:12.680 --> 12:15.140
this week instead of, like, all week.

12:15.140 --> 12:18.780
Which is really, really, really nice because I work 40 hour weeks.

12:18.780 --> 12:25.100
Thanksgiving was nice but was tiring because we had to go to Ross's family's

12:25.100 --> 12:29.580
Thanksgiving thing and then go to my family's Thanksgiving thing and split

12:29.580 --> 12:34.900
the holiday and yada yada and then yesterday we spent all day getting Ross's

12:34.900 --> 12:39.180
car fixed and and worked on and everything and then today we went to go

12:39.180 --> 12:43.780
get my car fixed lo and behold imagine this look you should get a good kick out

12:43.780 --> 12:52.860
this one afford with brake problems hmm familiar Wow concept no mine I still

12:52.860 --> 12:56.560
haven't taken it in I because I thought I figured out what the problem was but

12:56.560 --> 13:00.500
then I didn't I don't know what it is whenever I coast it makes a very loud

13:00.500 --> 13:05.980
like growling noise like my car is angry that I'm driving it or something yeah

13:05.980 --> 13:10.800
mine started whenever I it's like if I'm going low speeds anything like 20

13:10.800 --> 13:15.360
miles per hour or below and then I proceed to brake it's starting to squeal

13:15.360 --> 13:20.040
but if it's raining it won't squeal yeah my I don't know what the hell's wrong

13:20.040 --> 13:24.560
but I'm thinking about taking it in but I would actually take it into the

13:24.560 --> 13:27.600
dealership and have it looked at because they should do at least a brake

13:27.600 --> 13:33.040
inspection for free yeah well I have the special warranty where anything's fucked

13:33.040 --> 13:38.640
up with my car only cost me $25 yeah like let's just let the engine fall out

13:38.640 --> 13:42.360
Unfortunately, I'm not that privileged.

13:42.360 --> 13:46.200
I've already had fluids issues with my car, and now they don't know what's going wrong

13:46.200 --> 13:48.340
with it, so it's all that fun.

13:48.340 --> 13:51.200
And it's still squealing, even though they adjusted my brakes.

13:51.200 --> 13:52.760
Ford fix or repair daily.

13:52.760 --> 13:56.720
Yeah, but they're cheap, and that's the whole concept.

13:56.720 --> 14:00.640
You buy a cheap car, you get a shoddy car, but it'll last a few years.

14:00.640 --> 14:03.120
And you've made this comparison before, I've heard you do this, it's like talking about

14:03.120 --> 14:07.840
the Mad Catz dance pads for DDR the $20 dance pads versus the you know $100

14:07.840 --> 14:12.760
yeah I mean exactly if you're gonna pay for you know an ignition 2.0 you're

14:12.760 --> 14:15.880
gonna get the quality of that it's gonna last a long time but you're gonna pay

14:15.880 --> 14:20.280
out the ass for it but if you're gonna pay for the Mad Catz pad you have to

14:20.280 --> 14:24.680
understand there's going to be some problems with it eventually had speedy

14:24.680 --> 14:31.120
oil change not killed my car I wouldn't have this problem now would I but yeah

14:31.120 --> 14:34.640
Yeah, so that's kind of frustrating, and that's how I spent my day, was being frustrating.

14:34.640 --> 14:38.720
Oh, that's so funny. Well, take out your frustrations on our listeners.

14:38.720 --> 14:44.200
Yeah! Damn you all! Damn you all to hell!

14:44.200 --> 14:48.880
All right, anything else you want to share about your week, do you think?

14:48.880 --> 14:51.520
Um, no. Okay. How was Thanksgiving?

14:51.520 --> 14:56.800
I talked about that, but you weren't listening. I said I had to do the two-family thing. We

14:56.800 --> 14:59.880
went to Ross's family's house, and then we went to my family's house.

14:59.880 --> 15:06.720
I was prying to get that other story you were telling me I was doing that prying thing that

15:06.720 --> 15:09.800
hosts do when they know that there's a topic that needs to be talked about but they don't

15:09.800 --> 15:13.120
want to say that there's one.

15:13.120 --> 15:19.840
What we did is we decided to bring all of our odd music games with us so we brought

15:19.840 --> 15:28.340
our taiko drum master and donkey conga and karaoke revolution one two and three and we

15:28.340 --> 15:34.140
We took them all over to my parents' house and I'm guessing my mom had a little bit too

15:34.140 --> 15:40.060
much wine to drink because she was just having way too much fun on everything.

15:40.060 --> 15:44.700
My mom, strange enough, if you know me, it's really, really unique.

15:44.700 --> 15:47.940
My mom has absolutely no sense of rhythm whatsoever.

15:47.940 --> 15:52.020
She is like the whitest white girl possible.

15:52.020 --> 15:53.020
She tried to play taiko-chan.

15:53.020 --> 15:55.020
I noticed it runs in the family.

15:55.020 --> 16:02.680
Couldn't resist. So she tried to play taiko drum master and

16:02.680 --> 16:09.420
she got like a 58% on some one star easy song and just absolutely biffed it. So my brother-in-law

16:09.420 --> 16:18.140
who's a drummer had to show her up and then after he did that my blind father took over

16:18.140 --> 16:26.180
the drum, asked us to put it on a song, and proceeded to outplay my mother. He just started,

16:26.180 --> 16:30.980
you know, doing this doon-doonch, doon-doonch, just this random beat. Because, again, he's

16:30.980 --> 16:35.540
blind. He's blind. So he can't see the shots. He can't see what's going on on the screen.

16:35.540 --> 16:41.060
He's blind and he's just playing whatever, and he's doing well with the damn game. I

16:41.060 --> 16:43.420
I have no idea how.

16:43.420 --> 16:49.500
And at one point he stopped randomly, but we got him to start back up again, and if

16:49.500 --> 16:54.140
he hadn't stopped and gotten off of his little groove that he was in, he probably would have

16:54.140 --> 16:58.820
passed the song, which is extremely scary.

16:58.820 --> 17:00.920
But he ended up getting like a 48%.

17:00.920 --> 17:05.640
He didn't beat my mom, but came within 10%, so I can now say that my blind father can

17:05.640 --> 17:07.480
play taiko drum master.

17:07.480 --> 17:08.480
Very nice.

17:08.480 --> 17:10.700
You know, I think this was a topic once in DDR chit chat.

17:10.700 --> 17:16.700
do you play DDR when you're blind? You don't! You just kind of stomp on all the arrows.

17:16.700 --> 17:20.780
You just kind of dance in the rhythm and you'd be surprised how well you can do. I actually

17:20.780 --> 17:27.780
have never had my dad play DDR but maybe I should. That might be fun. I don't know. I'm

17:27.820 --> 17:31.820
thinking he would be good with Donkey Kong though too. Oh very cool. Yeah. Very cool.

17:31.820 --> 17:36.420
Alright. That's about it. Alright we're going to move on. Let's talk to DDR Angel. How was

17:36.420 --> 17:40.140
your week? How was your day? How does a blind person play DDR? Oh boy what did I just walk

17:40.140 --> 17:45.060
into. Same crap you've been walking into for the past, what, year and a half? Almost two.

17:45.060 --> 17:57.620
Yeah, exactly. Um, not much going on. I mean, had two days of school this week, and that was pretty good

17:57.620 --> 18:08.420
because I really needed the break, just like I'm sure Jess did and all that. After school was over, just, you know,

18:08.420 --> 18:13.420
Spent the last four days playing games that I haven't been able to play.

18:13.420 --> 18:18.420
And I got my DS! Yay!

18:18.420 --> 18:23.420
That took six stores to find and it was not

18:23.420 --> 18:28.420
good until I walked away with it and it was all good.

18:28.420 --> 18:33.420
Best Buy is not your friend unless you call all the stores in Sacramento.

18:33.420 --> 18:35.420
I got my DS at Best Buy, what's your problem?

18:36.420 --> 18:38.420
I had to call 6 stores, that was not cool.

18:39.420 --> 18:41.420
Or however many stores we got, 4.

18:43.420 --> 18:45.420
Yeah, so I got my DS and it's all good.

18:46.420 --> 18:48.420
The minigames on Mario 64 are your friend.

18:50.420 --> 18:53.420
Minigames on Mario 64 DS rock, they make that game worth it, they really do.

18:55.420 --> 18:58.420
You just spend all your time playing the minigames rather than playing the actual game.

19:00.420 --> 19:01.420
Favorite minigame so far?

19:01.420 --> 19:03.420
The Bob-omb slingshot game.

19:03.420 --> 19:07.420
I love that one. My other favorite one is the he-loves-me-he-loves-me-not.

19:07.420 --> 19:08.420
Yes, yes.

19:08.420 --> 19:09.420
It's gender neutral, isn't it?

19:09.420 --> 19:10.420
It's just funny.

19:10.420 --> 19:11.420
Loves-me-loves-me-not, that's it.

19:11.420 --> 19:12.420
Uh-huh.

19:12.420 --> 19:14.420
Go Yoshi.

19:15.420 --> 19:17.420
It's so lame, yet so fun.

19:17.420 --> 19:18.420
Alright.

19:18.420 --> 19:21.420
We should get back on that blind DVR topic later.

19:21.420 --> 19:22.420
Okay.

19:22.420 --> 19:23.420
I have a reason for that, anyway.

19:23.420 --> 19:24.420
Okay, maybe we will.

19:24.420 --> 19:25.420
Okay.

19:25.420 --> 19:26.420
Alright.

19:26.420 --> 19:27.420
Cool.

19:27.420 --> 19:28.420
Alright, yeah.

19:28.420 --> 19:29.420
Islander, how was your week? How was your day?

19:29.420 --> 19:34.740
Um, I was fine. Um, pretty much Jessica has already summed it up for those of you who

19:34.740 --> 19:39.660
don't know, that I want a girl and I are a couple, duh.

19:39.660 --> 19:43.180
Oh my god, it's a DDR couple. We are?

19:43.180 --> 19:52.180
I thought you were just, like, sleeping in my bed for no fair reason.

19:52.180 --> 19:59.180
This is a TFI alert. I thought you were just my sex slave, I don't

19:59.180 --> 20:05.180
Hello, the TMI SWAT team's here.

20:05.180 --> 20:16.180
But no, just spent the days off playing games that we bought because we kind of went crazy

20:16.180 --> 20:25.180
and bought a shitload of games, including Taiko, Donkey Konga, oh shit, KR3.

20:25.180 --> 20:28.180
You guys went on quite a little spending spree, didn't you?

20:28.180 --> 20:29.180
Yeah...

20:29.180 --> 20:30.180
We went a little crazy.

20:30.180 --> 20:31.180
But we've been good.

20:31.180 --> 20:35.620
A little crazy, rumble roses.

20:35.620 --> 20:39.340
We've lost almost 80 pounds, we've earned it.

20:39.340 --> 20:44.540
But yeah, just from playing all these games that I'm like, holy crap, I have new stuff

20:44.540 --> 20:45.540
to play now.

20:45.540 --> 20:48.340
So, just been doing a lot of that lately.

20:48.340 --> 20:49.340
Very cool.

20:49.340 --> 20:50.340
Very cool.

20:50.340 --> 20:52.340
Anything else you want to share about your...

20:52.340 --> 20:54.500
Um, let's see.

20:54.500 --> 21:01.500
Other than watching her blind father play taiko, I'm trying to think what else was pretty

21:02.820 --> 21:08.820
remarkable this weekend. I think she pretty much covered everything.

21:08.820 --> 21:10.020
Alright, fair enough then.

21:10.020 --> 21:14.580
Loki, my friend, how was your week? How was your day?

21:14.580 --> 21:21.580
Well, my week was okay because it was short. Work-wise it was short. We had a potluck on

21:21.580 --> 21:27.900
like a potluck on wednesday and i had lots of food and didn't really do anything so that's cool um

21:27.900 --> 21:35.900
then played final fantasy most of the week and then um what else oh just more ds crap um have

21:35.900 --> 21:43.820
like 41 stars now in mario 64 and that game's frustrating as hell and um then i also bought

21:43.820 --> 21:51.260
uh two new games i bought um alien hominid and under the skin and those are strange i love alien

22:21.260 --> 22:40.260
It was full of like, turkey, and like, spaghetti, and now I have pizza. It's way too much food. And, I don't know, really other than that, not too much. Just trying to figure out how to spend my time during this 4-day weekend and I think I wasted most of it on Final Fantasy.

22:40.260 --> 22:55.420
But anyways. Oh, and I got another game. However, due to foreshadowing I cannot reveal what

22:55.420 --> 23:03.580
game that would be. So, let me just say that first off that I don't know why I bought this

23:03.580 --> 23:08.700
game and I think that there were powers that would be that would coerce me into doing so

23:08.700 --> 23:17.520
against my will. In other words, his girlfriend said buy it or I'm not putting out. Which

23:17.520 --> 23:21.840
by the way is very interesting when you consider his girlfriend is not a gamer at all. At all.

23:21.840 --> 23:33.240
But yet she loves Mario 64 DS and she loves this game. But I love her so I forgive her.

23:33.240 --> 23:38.640
She just likes to watch my suffering. She likes to watch?

23:38.640 --> 23:47.640
She likes to participate, no. No, I don't know. Whatever. No. Alright, I'm done.

23:47.640 --> 23:51.360
Well, uh, my week and my day. I gotta make this quick because I gotta get to a break

23:51.360 --> 23:54.440
pretty soon here, but my week and my day was pretty cool. I went out to Roseau Golf Land

23:54.440 --> 23:59.120
one night. I know, gasps. Which is the first time in months I've been there, and I know

23:59.120 --> 24:02.120
we're an international show here, so for those of you guys that don't know what Roseau Golf

24:02.120 --> 24:06.480
plan is. It's where Bamani games go to die, basically, and get disrepair. But they have

24:06.480 --> 24:10.400
a brand new game called Derby Owners Club. We went out twice this weekend. And you've

24:10.400 --> 24:13.440
heard me talk about this game on the show before. You've heard Jamie talk about this

24:13.440 --> 24:16.640
game zillions of times on the show before. She loves this game. I love this game, too.

24:16.640 --> 24:22.360
I made a brand new horse. I called her Britney Spears so I could whip her. And I was so proud

24:22.360 --> 24:26.660
of Britney because she came in second in my first race. That's very proud. But where did

24:26.660 --> 24:30.960
these people come from at Golf Land who know how to play Derby Owners Club all of a sudden?

24:30.960 --> 24:32.960
Well, a lot of them come from UCD.

24:32.960 --> 24:35.960
Yeah, I've seen a lot of UCD up there.

24:35.960 --> 24:37.960
Man, I don't know what's going on with that.

24:37.960 --> 24:42.960
And then also, I played DDR Extreme for the first time in a while.

24:42.960 --> 24:47.960
Now, I've been slowly getting myself back into DDR, thanks to UltraMix 2 and what a kick-ass game it is,

24:47.960 --> 24:52.960
and Extreme and what a solid game that was that kind of held me over for UltraMix 2.

24:52.960 --> 24:54.960
That was good times. I've been playing those at home.

24:54.960 --> 24:57.960
But I've not really played a game in the arcade in a long time,

24:57.960 --> 25:02.480
So I kind of forgot what your ego can do to you when you're playing in the arcade is you want to kind of play

25:02.480 --> 25:09.520
The hardest stuff possible, right? So I decided all right, I'm gonna play breakdown on heavy nine-footer right pretty fast

25:09.520 --> 25:12.600
Absolutely failed didn't you failed one measure before the end?

25:13.800 --> 25:18.000
Do you know how that feels to be on your last step before you can hit your last step?

25:19.560 --> 25:21.560
Okay

25:21.880 --> 25:23.880
If it makes you feel better I

25:23.880 --> 25:28.280
I probably couldn't even pass anything past the seven footer at this point.

25:28.280 --> 25:31.280
That's how long it's been so let's play DDR.

25:31.280 --> 25:34.880
And yet I am the head administrator of

25:34.880 --> 25:37.880
the largest DDR site in the world.

25:37.880 --> 25:42.880
What the hell? I don't know. I don't get it myself.

25:42.880 --> 25:46.240
It's the love of the game though. I mean honestly I could suck at DDR but

25:46.240 --> 25:50.380
you know when games like Ultra Mix 2 come out I get in fanboy mode all over again.

25:50.380 --> 25:53.140
No matter if I suck at the game and I'm getting older one.

25:53.140 --> 25:57.140
But anyway, speaking of Ultramix 2, we gotta cut it short, we gotta go to a break, because when we come back from the break,

25:57.140 --> 26:00.640
Midihead from Ultramix 2 is gonna be here on the program.

26:00.640 --> 26:04.640
Very excited about that, so I want you guys to familiarize yourselves a little bit with Midihead,

26:04.640 --> 26:10.140
in case you forgot, I don't know how you could, because it's one of the most kick-ass remixes we've had in a DDR game in a long time.

26:10.140 --> 26:15.140
Remix of one of our favorite artists, Akira Yomoka, took his song, made it just...

26:15.140 --> 26:21.640
I can't say made it better, but certainly not made it worse, just made it different and cool, is what he did.

26:21.640 --> 26:24.000
And it's in my eyes, the MIDI head mix.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.840
Check it out, and when we come back, MIDI head will be on

26:25.840 --> 26:26.360
the program.

26:26.360 --> 26:33.360
we'll be back

26:56.360 --> 27:16.360
You're the light that makes me free That you're the need to bear

27:16.360 --> 27:21.360
You are like an empty dream

27:21.360 --> 27:28.360
You will never know what it can be

27:30.360 --> 27:36.360
You are like an empty dream

27:36.360 --> 27:43.360
You are like an empty dream

28:13.360 --> 28:29.720
We are back.

28:29.720 --> 28:33.200
That was, in my eyes, the MIDI Head Remix from UltraMix 2.

28:33.200 --> 28:37.640
We are excited because we're going to have our very first interview with an actual artist

28:37.640 --> 28:39.440
from DDR.

28:39.440 --> 28:40.440
This is shocking.

28:40.440 --> 28:41.440
I love it.

28:41.440 --> 28:42.440
Alright?

28:42.440 --> 28:45.880
buzz him up let's see if he's around let's call him up so I'm just gonna

28:45.880 --> 28:55.560
punch in the magic digit it is I hello is this MIDI head it is I that that must

28:55.560 --> 29:01.840
be a yes hello welcome to Orange Lounge radio greetings hey how you doing you

29:01.840 --> 29:07.600
know I'm doing great I'm just lounging around in my shorts I think we're in you

29:07.600 --> 29:15.360
Being as if we are Southern California, it's actually kind of nippy outside, but here in

29:15.360 --> 29:17.320
my studio it's nice and toasty.

29:17.320 --> 29:18.680
It's been pretty cold up here too.

29:18.680 --> 29:22.000
We are based out of Sacramento, so we are not that far away, we are just a stone's throw

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
away.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.840
It's not cold up there, is it?

29:24.840 --> 29:28.160
It's been freezing up here these past few days, don't you guys think so?

29:28.160 --> 29:29.160
In the 40's during...

29:29.160 --> 29:35.720
Have you guys ever been to New York City or Park City or any of those towns this time

29:35.720 --> 29:36.720
of year?

29:36.720 --> 29:41.360
Not this time of year, but I went there during the summer and that was bad enough this one

29:41.360 --> 29:42.360
night.

29:42.360 --> 29:44.360
You don't know cold, my friend.

29:44.360 --> 29:48.360
That's why we live here.

29:48.360 --> 29:49.360
That's why we live here.

29:49.360 --> 29:50.360
We've been there.

29:50.360 --> 29:51.360
That's why we live in California.

29:51.360 --> 29:52.360
That's right.

29:52.360 --> 29:56.880
You know, the folks that created Ultramix 2, they're over in Hawaii, so they've got

29:56.880 --> 29:59.940
to be loving it year-round there.

29:59.940 --> 30:05.360
They're getting the tropical moisture.

30:05.360 --> 30:07.760
skin is all nice and young looking.

30:07.760 --> 30:10.840
Except for the occasional tropical storm and things like that.

30:10.840 --> 30:12.440
Yeah, who cares.

30:12.440 --> 30:15.200
It's worth living in Hawaii for that.

30:15.200 --> 30:16.200
Absolutely.

30:16.200 --> 30:18.280
I would live there any old day of the week.

30:18.280 --> 30:22.840
Speaking of Hawaii, I'm kind of curious, how did you become involved with those guys in

30:22.840 --> 30:26.320
getting into DDR UltraMix II?

30:26.320 --> 30:31.600
Well actually I called them on the phone one day and I bribed them and said I would give

30:31.600 --> 30:38.840
them my wife and children would say, let me do the remix for them.

30:38.840 --> 30:41.440
What will your wife and child be doing at Konami now?

30:41.440 --> 30:51.200
Okay, now they are going to hear this and go, you sold it!

30:51.200 --> 30:59.600
Basically what happened is I got contacted by my label, A Different Drone, and there

30:59.600 --> 31:07.280
was a bulletin that went out to all of the artists on the label who said, hey, Konami

31:07.280 --> 31:15.480
wants to do this remix and they also want tracks and missions for the UltraMix II game.

31:15.480 --> 31:18.200
Anybody who's interested, here are the details.

31:18.200 --> 31:28.220
So basically I just got the original tracks from Konami and it was kind of a free-for-all.

31:28.220 --> 31:33.240
So I just did one and just kind of submitted it, not really thinking that it was going

31:33.240 --> 31:37.360
to go anywhere.

31:37.360 --> 31:43.160
Next thing I know I get a call from Jaron Tolman, who is one of their head sound designers

31:43.160 --> 31:47.360
down there and he said, hey, Konami liked it so much they want you to do an extended

31:47.360 --> 31:48.360
remix.

31:48.360 --> 31:52.600
Oh, which is the one we see on the V-Rare, that super long mix, right?

31:52.600 --> 31:53.600
Super long!

31:53.600 --> 31:54.600
Super long!

31:54.600 --> 31:59.480
Yeah, so that's how I got involved.

31:59.480 --> 32:00.480
Very cool, very cool.

32:00.480 --> 32:04.700
And there's lots of great music from a different drum, including UltraMix II.

32:04.700 --> 32:07.900
And I gotta tell you, I don't know how much of the scene you've kind of been watching

32:07.900 --> 32:12.320
and kind of the reaction from the DDR fans, but a lot of folks have been really into UltraMix

32:12.320 --> 32:16.700
too, and they kind of credit a lot of the success of the game because of the song list

32:16.700 --> 32:19.920
and because of a lot of the music that comes from a different drum.

32:19.920 --> 32:24.020
Bands such as Echo Image, Day Behavior, and all those folks and yourself all coming over

32:24.020 --> 32:25.020
from a different drum.

32:25.020 --> 32:26.020
It's been great.

32:26.020 --> 32:27.820
It's been a great collaboration.

32:27.820 --> 32:32.580
I hope you guys work together more in the future.

32:32.580 --> 32:38.460
I know that Konami has left the door open, so they've really liked what's come out of

32:38.460 --> 32:44.580
a different drum and myself included.

32:44.580 --> 32:54.620
What they are grateful for is the fact that they are not dealing with these prima donnas

32:54.620 --> 32:57.020
on these larger labels.

32:57.020 --> 32:59.980
They have all these demands.

32:59.980 --> 33:04.740
We just want to get our music out there and get it to the fans.

33:04.740 --> 33:09.540
Honestly, I would dance to Skulk, Close Your Eyes, the In My Eyes remix, I would dance

33:09.540 --> 33:11.780
to that long before I danced to Britney.

33:11.780 --> 33:12.780
On DDR.

33:12.780 --> 33:18.460
You know, you say that now, but if Britney was now standing in front of you, with uh...

33:18.460 --> 33:20.460
Nah, that's a good point, that's a good point.

33:20.460 --> 33:21.460
Britney, I'm your biggest fan!

33:21.460 --> 33:22.460
Come on, I know.

33:22.460 --> 33:30.380
You'd be dancing to Britney all night if she was sitting right there in your recliner.

33:30.380 --> 33:31.380
I got a point.

33:31.380 --> 33:36.300
But speaking, since we're kind of talking about DDR here, did you know about DDR before

33:36.300 --> 33:37.700
you became involved with the project?

33:37.700 --> 33:38.700
Did you ever play it?

33:38.700 --> 33:39.700
I mean, you mentioned you had a kid.

33:39.700 --> 33:44.260
You know, I gotta tell you guys, this is gonna piss off some of your listeners, but...

33:44.260 --> 33:48.340
That's alright, we piss them off and up.

33:48.340 --> 33:58.180
You know, I used to be extremely into video games and found them to, it was kind of, I

33:58.180 --> 34:05.700
I won't say it's a waste of time, but for me, it was like getting in the way of producing

34:05.700 --> 34:11.100
albums and, you know, basically, since I have a family, I have to be a responsible adult

34:11.100 --> 34:16.220
now, so I kind of got out of the whole video game thing.

34:16.220 --> 34:20.420
I used to be, like, you know, heavily into, do you guys remember Descent?

34:20.420 --> 34:21.420
Oh, yeah.

34:21.420 --> 34:22.420
Oh, yeah.

34:22.420 --> 34:23.420
Oh, yeah.

34:23.420 --> 34:24.420
I used to play that, yeah.

34:24.420 --> 34:25.420
Way back in the day.

34:25.420 --> 34:44.420
Most recently I was heavily into the Quake 3 add-on mod, Urban Terror, so that is by far the best game I've played to date.

34:44.420 --> 34:48.420
I've never played BDR though guys, I'm sorry.

34:48.420 --> 34:55.420
That's alright, that's alright. You were talking some stuff to me before the show that I totally wasn't getting either, so now we're even, okay?

34:55.420 --> 35:03.420
We're even. But, you know, you sound like the kind of guy, though, that if you were still playing video games, you'd be playing Halo 2 with the rest of us right now, I think.

35:03.420 --> 35:08.420
Yeah, I would be playing until my usual 4 or 5 o'clock in the morning.

35:08.420 --> 35:12.420
And you would be getting your ass kicked by 13-year-olds, just like the rest of us do.

35:12.420 --> 35:19.260
You know, what's funny is I actually had a 13-year-old show me some moves on Urban Terror

35:19.260 --> 35:23.320
one night late when we had the whole entire board to ourselves while everybody else went

35:23.320 --> 35:24.320
to bed.

35:24.320 --> 35:27.720
It was kind of funny.

35:27.720 --> 35:33.520
I'm 33 and this little 13-year-old is showing me stuff that I would have ever figured out

35:33.520 --> 35:34.520
on my own.

35:34.520 --> 35:35.520
Wow.

35:35.520 --> 35:36.520
The kids these days.

35:36.520 --> 35:37.520
I feel so old saying that myself.

35:37.520 --> 35:38.520
Where is our youth going?

35:38.520 --> 35:40.520
I feel so old saying that myself.

35:40.520 --> 35:42.520
Where is our youth going?

35:44.520 --> 35:51.520
Mideet, I want to ask you about the song that you specifically remixed, In My Eyes, a track originally done by Kiryamaoka.

35:51.520 --> 35:58.520
You kind of mentioned that you had a lot of the original Konami tracks, so was it your choice to remix that particular song?

35:58.520 --> 36:09.720
Yeah, you know, I think out of the two songs that I was given, that one kind of stuck out

36:09.720 --> 36:15.760
the most because the chord progression, I knew right away what to do with it when I

36:15.760 --> 36:16.760
heard it.

36:16.760 --> 36:26.920
So I pretty much took out all of his musical elements, left the vocals, and just re-did

36:26.920 --> 36:32.040
everything from the ground up yeah you can tell that like a lot it's not just

36:32.040 --> 36:35.440
you know you took a song and added a new beat to it but you just totally kind of

36:35.440 --> 36:38.840
deconstructed it and then built it from the ground up and I think that's part of

36:38.840 --> 36:44.120
what's so great about it so yeah thank you no problem no problem anytime I have

36:44.120 --> 36:47.120
you gotten a chance to talk to Akira about the remix so I don't know if you

36:47.120 --> 36:53.720
got you know he and I talk every day well you know we got to talk to him one

36:53.720 --> 36:56.560
time and unfortunately didn't we didn't get him on air we got to talk to him one

36:56.560 --> 37:01.560
And I tell you we were just giddy little fanboys. It was just amazing. I don't know if you've ever played this.

37:01.560 --> 37:06.560
No, actually, I haven't spoke to him. I have no idea how he feels about the remix whatsoever. No clue.

37:06.560 --> 37:09.560
We should find out. We have ways of finding out.

37:09.560 --> 37:16.560
For all I know, he thinks, you know, this is garbage. What has he done to my song? I don't know.

37:16.560 --> 37:22.560
No, I'm sure he loves it. Trust me, there's been some remixes in DDR in the past that were absolute garbage.

37:22.560 --> 37:25.560
Yours is not garbage. Don't worry about it.

37:25.560 --> 37:29.560
Thank you. My head is swelling now. It's huge.

37:29.560 --> 37:31.560
You're right. I need to stop.

37:31.560 --> 37:35.560
What kind of equipment do you use to do these remixes in your studio?

37:35.560 --> 37:39.560
Actually, I'm a big fan of...

37:39.560 --> 37:43.560
See, this will all go over your head. We're back to the over-your-head thing.

37:43.560 --> 37:46.560
Alright, that's fine. Maybe some of our listeners will catch up on it.

37:46.560 --> 37:52.560
Okay. So, I actually use acid, and I'm not talking about white blotter.

37:52.560 --> 37:57.120
Okay, now my co-host, Loki, is very familiar with ACID.

37:57.120 --> 37:58.520
He does his own remixing in ACID.

37:58.520 --> 37:59.520
So that I know.

37:59.520 --> 38:00.520
I'm with you so far.

38:00.520 --> 38:01.520
I'm with you so far.

38:01.520 --> 38:02.520
Alright, cool, cool.

38:02.520 --> 38:06.680
Well, you know, a lot of people have kind of raised their brow when I tell them that

38:06.680 --> 38:12.720
because ACID is more of a loop construction tool, you know, according to the masses.

38:12.720 --> 38:18.520
And actually I use it for tracking and, you know, doing a lot of really cool stuff.

38:18.520 --> 38:21.520
I mean, I've been using it since the program first came out.

38:21.520 --> 38:25.640
I want to point out, I'm sorry, I hate to cut you off, but I've got to say this, I've

38:25.640 --> 38:29.840
got to say this, because there's been these amateur remix contests that have happened

38:29.840 --> 38:33.440
throughout the Bamani scene that go on on such big websites and they want to get people

38:33.440 --> 38:39.420
to remix stuff and they always say, don't use acid, because we want a program that is,

38:39.420 --> 38:42.440
we want something that doesn't sound like two songs meshed together.

38:42.440 --> 38:47.600
I would just like to point out, the pros have just said that they use acid.

38:47.600 --> 38:50.800
So STFU guys, STFU.

38:50.800 --> 38:55.440
Yeah, it's a great program, especially now in version 5.

38:55.440 --> 39:00.100
But I use acid in conjunction with, you know, I do a lot of the elements live, so I don't

39:00.100 --> 39:01.100
sequence much.

39:01.100 --> 39:07.760
I actually just hit the record button and will just play the sequence at live.

39:07.760 --> 39:14.640
If it's an arpeggiated piece, you know, that of course is sequenced, but most of it goes

39:14.640 --> 39:19.320
live in acid, and then I just chop it up and dice it up and move stuff around, and it's

39:19.320 --> 39:20.880
just a lot faster that way.

39:20.880 --> 39:29.440
I use virtual instruments in addition to my AccessVirus KC, I have all the Spectrosonics

39:29.440 --> 39:41.140
Stylus RMX, Atmosphere Trilogy, and of course I've got software from Vanguard, I use Vanguard

39:41.140 --> 39:47.620
I played it in Zeta, and I love SoftSense.

39:47.620 --> 39:50.420
Very cool. Now see, Loki's following you here. Maybe I should just...

39:50.420 --> 39:52.020
It's alright.

39:52.020 --> 39:56.260
See, well, I mean, you know, basically the stuff I do is very, very, very amateur.

39:56.260 --> 40:01.700
I mean, I'm not even going as far as calling them actual remixes, more of just white label remixes and stuff.

40:01.700 --> 40:06.740
Because, you know, I don't really have the talent at the moment to be actually creating my own stuff.

40:06.740 --> 40:10.740
Basically it's a lot of loop chopping and adding a little bit of elements that way.

40:10.740 --> 40:15.740
But a lot of people just hate the fact that I'm not using Fruity Loops.

40:15.740 --> 40:17.740
They think Fruity Loops is like a god program out there.

40:17.740 --> 40:21.740
I don't know why, because it's... I don't know.

40:21.740 --> 40:24.740
I've got to admit that I use Fruity Loops to program...

40:24.740 --> 40:29.740
Sometimes I will program some beats in Fruity Loops.

40:29.740 --> 40:34.740
It's great for that, but I can't construct an entire song in Fruity Loops.

40:34.740 --> 40:36.740
I just love acid.

40:37.740 --> 40:40.740
You love acid? Are you a permafry, my friend?

40:41.740 --> 40:43.740
Yes, I guess.

40:45.740 --> 40:49.740
You were mentioning that there was two songs that you were sent there.

40:49.740 --> 40:54.740
Were there actually other songs that you remixed for DDR that didn't make it onto Ultra Mix 2?

40:54.740 --> 40:59.740
No, come on now. Would I have remixed a song that wouldn't have made it on DDR?

40:59.740 --> 41:03.720
Well, maybe I'm thinking maybe you're one of those artists that construct something

41:03.720 --> 41:06.760
and then you go, no, it's crap, it's crap, and you throw it out.

41:06.760 --> 41:12.100
No, no, no, no, no, man, I've been doing this since 1989.

41:12.100 --> 41:15.860
That whole phase has been definitely worked out of me.

41:15.860 --> 41:19.660
No, actually, this was the one song I remixed.

41:19.660 --> 41:25.820
It was kind of a stab in the dark, and I threw it out there, and lo and behold.

41:25.820 --> 41:27.500
Very cool, very cool.

41:27.500 --> 41:30.940
You mentioned that you might be doing this again for another Konami project.

41:30.940 --> 41:34.820
Do you see yourself being involved with a future Konami game?

41:34.820 --> 41:37.060
Oh sure, yeah.

41:37.060 --> 41:42.380
Nothing specific at the moment, but like I said earlier, the door's open and we've been

41:42.380 --> 41:47.700
in talks about keeping in touch and doing more, so they've been really happy with this

41:47.700 --> 41:50.100
last remix.

41:50.100 --> 41:54.380
It's not just the remix, you have to look at the actual business side too, if you're

41:54.380 --> 41:58.880
You're easy to deal with as an artist and this is just tips going out there to people

41:58.880 --> 42:01.220
trying to get their foot in the door.

42:01.220 --> 42:05.180
It's not just the quality of the work that you do.

42:05.180 --> 42:08.620
It's also your attitude and your business dealings with these guys.

42:08.620 --> 42:17.700
If you're professional from start to finish and you're very proficient and attentive,

42:17.700 --> 42:22.420
a lot of people make great music but can't get work and it's because they don't have

42:22.420 --> 42:27.920
the relationship thing down and you've got to be able to have a good working relationship

42:27.920 --> 42:28.920
with these guys.

42:28.920 --> 42:30.440
I absolutely agree.

42:30.440 --> 42:35.080
That's why I am all about kissing ass on this program.

42:35.080 --> 42:39.240
Did you get the chocolates I sent you, Midyhead?

42:39.240 --> 42:40.240
What?

42:40.240 --> 42:42.280
Did you get the chocolates we sent?

42:42.280 --> 42:44.560
Yeah, exactly.

42:44.560 --> 42:48.920
I have a brown nose too.

42:48.920 --> 42:57.600
Now, if the folks that are listening go on over to your website over at www.midihead.com,

42:57.600 --> 43:01.120
and I hope that they do because it's a great website, you notice that there's a lot of

43:01.120 --> 43:02.720
other stuff that you've worked with before.

43:02.720 --> 43:06.560
You did some TV gigs, you did some movie things in the past before.

43:06.560 --> 43:09.920
But what I want to know, have you worked with video game music ever before?

43:09.920 --> 43:10.920
Was this the first thing?

43:10.920 --> 43:13.880
No, I've never worked with video game music before.

43:13.880 --> 43:14.880
Oh, wow.

43:14.880 --> 43:21.640
I moved out here to Los Angeles to try some things.

43:21.640 --> 43:29.840
The first stuff I did was for Fox Television's Dark Angel.

43:29.840 --> 43:35.560
When that happened I started landing tracks through my publisher in a lot of different

43:35.560 --> 43:42.140
television shows and was able to get one landed in the Matrix Reloaded movie trailer just

43:42.140 --> 43:45.980
part of the film's release.

43:45.980 --> 43:48.260
That had been most of my experience.

43:48.260 --> 43:52.020
I had looked into video games several times going, you know, I should do that.

43:52.020 --> 43:53.020
I should get into that.

43:53.020 --> 43:55.460
I had no idea how.

43:55.460 --> 43:57.780
I had friends that were doing it.

43:57.780 --> 44:03.100
I asked them how I would get involved and they said, you know, it's a nightmare trying

44:03.100 --> 44:06.940
to get in there because so many people are trying to do it.

44:06.940 --> 44:13.520
So I just never really pursued it because I always had other things that I had priorities

44:13.520 --> 44:14.520
on doing.

44:14.520 --> 44:21.040
So now, I just kind of knocked on my door for a change.

44:21.040 --> 44:25.920
Hopefully there will be more stuff in the video game world because certainly there's

44:25.920 --> 44:32.920
a huge market for it and from what I understand, the guys that are doing it and doing it well

44:32.920 --> 44:36.280
are doing well themselves.

44:36.280 --> 44:39.940
There are folks who actually were in Ultramix too that are quite familiar with the video

44:39.940 --> 44:40.940
game music stuff.

44:40.940 --> 44:44.260
Jesper Kidd I know is one of them and he's done a lot of previous video game stuff and

44:44.260 --> 44:48.340
now he's kind of crossing over into DDR so you know there's lots of I think opportunities

44:48.340 --> 44:52.420
for making great music for video games out there you know especially what they keep saying

44:52.420 --> 44:57.500
it's getting bigger than movies now we'll see I mean who knows who knows all right um

44:57.500 --> 45:01.300
I know you're going to be putting in a live appearance at this uh upcoming convention

45:01.300 --> 45:06.540
this Otaku Con, is that what it's called? Yeah. What's going on with that? How'd you

45:06.540 --> 45:13.500
get involved with that? Again, my label got involved in that. They were contacted, a different

45:13.500 --> 45:22.020
drum was contacted by Otaku Con about having a different drum be involved and of course

45:22.020 --> 45:29.620
because of my involvement in DDR, I was one of the first artists contacted to be in that.

45:29.620 --> 45:32.340
The Otakus love DDR, just so you know.

45:32.340 --> 45:33.340
Oh yeah, yeah.

45:33.340 --> 45:37.540
So we'll be performing that track live on stage at the...

45:37.540 --> 45:43.140
Just so you guys know, yeah, that's going to be in Miami Beach if any of you guys are

45:43.140 --> 45:46.700
in that area or planning on traveling, and the convention's happening December 17th through

45:46.700 --> 45:47.700
the 19th.

45:47.700 --> 45:50.860
If you want to check out more information, it's otakukan.com, the MIDI head's going to

45:50.860 --> 45:51.860
be there.

45:51.860 --> 45:52.860
Cool.

45:52.860 --> 45:57.060
I'll be there with some tasty babes up on stage, my friend.

45:57.060 --> 45:58.060
Oh, even more!

45:58.060 --> 45:59.060
Yeah!

45:59.060 --> 46:09.060
I always perform with tasty babes, you have to have the dual sex appeal.

46:09.060 --> 46:12.380
Do they just get up on stage and kind of dance?

46:12.380 --> 46:16.140
Well they actually do have talent.

46:16.140 --> 46:19.380
I don't doubt it.

46:19.380 --> 46:21.860
So they'll sing and play keyboards.

46:21.860 --> 46:31.820
I've also got Lars Hausmann of Brave New World, but Lars Hausmann of Brave New World will

46:31.820 --> 46:33.380
be joining me on stage.

46:33.380 --> 46:34.380
Very cool.

46:34.380 --> 46:35.380
Cool.

46:35.380 --> 46:36.380
All right.

46:36.380 --> 46:37.380
So bands coming together.

46:37.380 --> 46:38.380
That would be awesome.

46:38.380 --> 46:39.380
Bands coming together.

46:39.380 --> 46:40.380
Lots of habit.

46:40.380 --> 46:42.860
That's how it works with a different drum label.

46:42.860 --> 46:47.100
A lot of the artists work together and collaborate on different projects.

46:47.100 --> 46:48.100
It's really cool.

46:48.100 --> 46:49.220
It's a great label to be involved in.

46:49.220 --> 46:51.040
I'm kind of noticing that.

46:51.040 --> 46:55.480
I'm kind of hoping that people are checking out A Different Drum over at adifferentdrum.com

46:55.480 --> 47:01.840
and just because everything they've done for DDR has been so great, and just, you know,

47:01.840 --> 47:07.040
I really, to be honest, I had no clue a lot of this music was out there before DDR.

47:07.040 --> 47:11.000
It was kind of like, because of my involvement with this show, I kind of, you know, when

47:11.000 --> 47:14.460
this music was announced, I kind of went on over to the site and I was kind of checking

47:14.460 --> 47:17.360
out some of the music by the artist, I was like, this stuff is great.

47:17.360 --> 47:18.360
This stuff is really great.

47:18.360 --> 47:22.060
You know, it's stuff you probably wouldn't hear of if you didn't think to look.

47:22.060 --> 47:26.720
It's definitely not the mainstream, I mean it's synth pop.

47:26.720 --> 47:33.340
And what's interesting though is because, I don't know how old you guys are, but I don't

47:33.340 --> 47:35.680
know if you remember the 80s at all.

47:35.680 --> 47:36.680
A little bit.

47:36.680 --> 47:37.680
Iguan girls lighten up over there.

47:37.680 --> 47:38.680
It was a blur, man.

47:38.680 --> 47:40.680
If it makes you feel better, I'm 27.

47:40.680 --> 47:44.240
I was just passing out of the uterus then.

47:44.240 --> 47:51.600
No, no, I may sound young, but I'm actually 26, so I'm not that young, man, okay, alright,

47:51.600 --> 47:52.600
cool.

47:52.600 --> 47:55.680
We remember the 80s, it's all good.

47:55.680 --> 48:00.380
But I used to DJ in the 80s, and so a lot of the music that comes off of a different

48:00.380 --> 48:04.460
drum label is kind of reminiscent of that era.

48:04.460 --> 48:10.040
That's what I'm loving too, like the Naropa song, I remember when I heard that the first

48:10.040 --> 48:11.040
time I was like-

48:11.040 --> 48:12.040
It's Depeche Mode!

48:12.040 --> 48:17.580
Depeche Mode meets Erasure meets, like, cool. I just loved it, so definitely a lot of 80s

48:17.580 --> 48:21.420
remnants and stuff in there. Very cool. I just wanted to pass this along to you now.

48:21.420 --> 48:25.380
We actually have somebody in our chat room right now over at Orangelaunchradio.com, click

48:25.380 --> 48:31.980
on chat, somebody that works for Konami. And he actually says that their product manager,

48:31.980 --> 48:37.260
Jason Enos, said that Akira has heard the remix you did, and he likes it a lot. And

48:37.260 --> 48:39.940
I'm supposed to let you know. I'm supposed to let you know.

48:39.940 --> 48:41.940
Right on.

48:41.940 --> 48:45.940
Wow, I'm glad that the information could come to us that fast. God bless the internet.

48:45.940 --> 48:51.940
Look at that. A first ever in the life of Midihead. He hears from the man himself.

48:51.940 --> 48:53.940
Well, I'm not really the man. I'm just coming through.

48:53.940 --> 48:56.940
Live on Orange Lounge Radio.

48:56.940 --> 48:58.940
That was my best Roger radio voice, by the way.

48:58.940 --> 49:00.940
Welcome to the Morning Drive.

49:00.940 --> 49:08.940
Welcome to the Morning Drive.

49:08.940 --> 49:23.900
I used to intern at a Top 40 radio station back when I was 14 years old, when I started

49:23.900 --> 49:26.900
to get into radio.

49:26.900 --> 49:32.300
I sat down in the general manager's office at the radio station about the time I was

49:32.300 --> 49:34.860
16 years old and he said,

49:34.860 --> 49:45.240
Mike, I'm sorry to tell you this, but I don't think you have the voice for radio, so I passed

49:45.240 --> 49:46.240
up the career, guys.

49:46.240 --> 49:52.240
I know it sounds like I should have stuck with it, but uh...

49:52.240 --> 49:58.600
Yeah, I have to admit I've hit a few roadblocks on my way up the radio ladder, so that's why

49:58.600 --> 50:00.160
I'm stuck here doing internet radio.

50:00.160 --> 50:04.760
But see, the way I figure is that together, when we work together like this, when the

50:04.760 --> 50:08.480
indie labels come together with the indie radio stations, we're going to take over the

50:08.480 --> 50:09.480
world!

50:09.480 --> 50:10.480
Yeah, man!

50:10.480 --> 50:12.480
Define and conquer!

50:12.480 --> 50:16.160
Power to the people!

50:16.160 --> 50:17.160
Right on.

50:17.160 --> 50:21.600
Let's see, what other kind of future projects are you working on right now?

50:21.600 --> 50:25.120
I know you've done work for TV and movies, is there anything else upcoming that we can

50:25.120 --> 50:26.120
look forward to?

50:26.120 --> 50:35.200
Yeah, you know, I'm going to be in several B-movies and since I'm in the Los Angeles

50:35.200 --> 50:38.080
area there will be some of the adult film.

50:38.080 --> 50:41.320
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

50:41.320 --> 50:44.320
Okay, I hope everybody knows I'm just kidding.

50:44.320 --> 50:45.320
You were?

50:45.320 --> 50:46.320
Yeah, yeah, okay.

50:46.320 --> 50:47.320
Wait, no, I'm kidding.

50:47.320 --> 50:49.680
I was looking forward to some Bow Chickabow Wow.

50:49.680 --> 50:51.880
Bow Chickabow Wow.

50:51.880 --> 50:58.200
But no, I'm actually working on a new album and the title of the album is called Weapons

50:58.200 --> 51:02.400
of Mass Seduction.

51:02.400 --> 51:05.960
That sounds porno right there.

51:05.960 --> 51:12.200
I was afraid of that originally when I thought of the title, but because of my frustration

51:12.200 --> 51:20.520
with the media and pretty much just turning on the local television stations here in California,

51:20.520 --> 51:27.160
I don't know, I don't know, I don't want to get into politics, but I'm more of a conservative

51:27.160 --> 51:30.320
kind of guy than, I would say, a liberal.

51:30.320 --> 51:39.240
And you know, it just frustrates me, the kind of crap we get fed on the TV.

51:39.240 --> 51:45.960
So that's kind of where the title came from, was the weapons of mass seduction being the

51:45.960 --> 51:47.960
media.

51:47.960 --> 51:51.520
here in Sacramento remember we're right in the middle of Arnold country so we

51:51.520 --> 51:54.940
see lots and lots of stuff on the news all the time is this you know all these

51:54.940 --> 52:01.080
interesting stuff so yeah um let's see oh for other fans for the fans of your

52:01.080 --> 52:05.160
in my eyes remix that you did where can they check out more your music the if

52:05.160 --> 52:08.080
they you know like that remix and thinking I want to check out some more

52:08.080 --> 52:12.400
MIDI head stuff we're gonna go to check some stuff out well I think you said it

52:12.400 --> 52:18.400
Everybody with me? Ready? www.MIDIhead.com.

52:18.400 --> 52:23.400
Words for me. Words for me. You have other albums out there right now, too, though, right?

52:23.400 --> 52:31.400
Yeah, I have the first album I released called Power Undiminished.

52:31.400 --> 52:42.840
won the American Synthpop Award in 2001 here in Hollywood, California for Best Album.

52:42.840 --> 52:54.200
Also, more recently than that, Dividing Asunder.

52:54.200 --> 53:01.380
I'm actually going to be doing my own radio broadcast here sometime in the month of December

53:01.380 --> 53:09.340
before OtakuCon where there will be a world premiere listening of my latest track which

53:09.340 --> 53:16.300
has not been released yet and that one is titled Away From Here.

53:16.300 --> 53:22.240
So I guess just check the website for that information and I'll keep you posted.

53:22.240 --> 53:26.120
So you're trying to break into the internet radio world as well, huh?

53:26.120 --> 53:29.960
Well no, I think it's fun.

53:29.960 --> 53:33.040
What you guys are doing, it sounds like you guys are having a good time.

53:33.040 --> 53:40.200
And I've always wanted to do my own show since I was a small kid, and internet has allowed

53:40.200 --> 53:41.680
us to do that.

53:41.680 --> 53:42.680
Absolutely.

53:42.680 --> 53:46.640
And I'm just going to try it out and see how I like it.

53:46.640 --> 53:49.600
And maybe I'll do once a month broadcasts or something.

53:49.600 --> 53:51.640
Be careful, it's really addicting.

53:51.640 --> 53:52.640
Because we...

53:52.640 --> 53:54.120
Iguana Girl, how long have we been doing this?

53:54.120 --> 53:56.920
You've been doing it for a couple of years at least?

53:56.920 --> 53:58.920
Well, yeah, probably like four or five now.

53:58.920 --> 54:03.520
I've been involved in various shows for probably about five or six years, so it's pretty addicting.

54:03.520 --> 54:06.920
You guys are doing Live 365, right?

54:06.920 --> 54:11.600
Yeah, this current program we're doing is through Live 365, Orange Lawns Radio, and

54:11.600 --> 54:13.600
they're great to us, too.

54:13.600 --> 54:17.720
So they've got a lot of great services for anybody that's looking into it.

54:17.720 --> 54:22.280
Even when they forgot to mention our name at the Best of Live 365 Awards, in which we

54:22.280 --> 54:28.240
were nominated in a category and they completely forgot us, we forgave them for it.

54:28.240 --> 54:31.480
Do we have the clip?

54:31.480 --> 54:32.480
I wish we had the clip.

54:32.480 --> 54:35.560
I would love for Mitty Head to hear the clip because it's hilarious and I don't think our

54:35.560 --> 54:37.520
listeners have heard the clip in a long time either.

54:37.520 --> 54:39.240
I'll have to dig that up.

54:39.240 --> 54:44.800
Wait, did they actually, you recorded the clip of them apologizing?

54:44.800 --> 54:49.000
The whole thing was broadcasted live and one of our listeners recorded it and sent the

54:49.000 --> 54:54.080
whole thing to us because it's hilarious because you can hear us in the background going, hey!

54:54.080 --> 54:56.040
They forgot our name.

54:56.040 --> 54:58.880
It's pretty funny.

54:58.880 --> 55:03.280
Anyway, I want to go ahead and allow our listeners a chance to ask some questions.

55:03.280 --> 55:07.860
OrangeLoungeRadio.com, click on chat and you can submit some questions live to us via our

55:07.860 --> 55:09.160
chat room.

55:09.160 --> 55:12.080
For instance, we have Legend of Zaku is in our chat room.

55:12.080 --> 55:13.080
He has a question for you here.

55:13.080 --> 55:17.360
He wants to know, how did you approach doing the remixing itself?

55:17.360 --> 55:22.800
In other words, what kind of inspired you to go about making the remix that you did?

55:22.800 --> 55:32.840
I think that I wanted to come from a cinematic sort of feel.

55:32.840 --> 55:40.400
If you listen to the beginning of the track, it kind of starts out with some heavy thunderous

55:40.400 --> 55:41.960
noises and stuff like that.

55:41.960 --> 55:49.120
So I kind of wanted it to be a very intense track because I felt the vocal was conveying

55:49.120 --> 55:53.520
a sort of intensity there and a seriousness.

55:53.520 --> 55:56.520
Does that answer the question?

55:56.520 --> 55:57.520
I think so.

55:57.520 --> 55:58.520
I think so.

55:58.520 --> 56:03.080
They're responding to it in chat that they're kind of giving it that epic sound a little

56:03.080 --> 56:04.080
bit.

56:04.080 --> 56:08.720
Yeah, but that's kind of how my sound is, hence the name Monolithic.

56:08.720 --> 56:11.300
Everything I do has an epic kind of sound to it.

56:11.300 --> 56:14.800
Now that was something that we didn't quite get into a little bit there before, but you

56:14.800 --> 56:16.660
actually work under several different names.

56:16.660 --> 56:18.900
Not just Midihead, but Monolithic as well.

56:18.900 --> 56:19.900
That's right.

56:19.900 --> 56:23.540
So are there any other pseudonyms that you use as well for music?

56:23.540 --> 56:26.860
Well there is the Sexy Skinny Guy.

56:26.860 --> 56:30.540
Hey, wait a minute, I thought that was my name.

56:30.540 --> 56:36.040
I had the trademark on that.

56:36.040 --> 56:37.040
Let's see.

56:37.040 --> 56:48.040
Trent Reznor? You know him? No, I'm sorry, I wouldn't want to own up to that guy. He's

56:48.040 --> 56:52.280
got great talent and everything. That's a different direction.

56:52.280 --> 56:56.380
Little different direction. You know what's interesting is there's actually

56:56.380 --> 57:01.000
one guy that does a lot of music for DDR and Naoki, I don't know if you've heard of him

57:01.000 --> 57:05.360
or not, he's got a lot of tracks. But that guy probably has 20 to 30 different

57:05.360 --> 57:10.620
pseudonyms he's done music under? It's crazy. You know what, that's the way you do it. I

57:10.620 --> 57:17.340
don't know how many of the pseudonyms you know that Prince has, but Prince has tons

57:17.340 --> 57:23.580
and tons of pseudonyms. He's produced so many albums under so many different names. I think

57:23.580 --> 57:28.940
that's the way to go. I probably will in the future release another album off of a different

57:28.940 --> 57:36.980
I think what happens is if one pseudonym dies or it's not successful or not working out,

57:36.980 --> 57:40.820
you can always do something else under a totally different name and people don't know it's

57:40.820 --> 57:41.820
you.

57:41.820 --> 57:42.820
You just reinvent yourself.

57:42.820 --> 57:46.780
You reinvent yourself or you do other music styles or whatever else you need to do, but

57:46.780 --> 57:49.420
I think if you're an artist, that's a smart thing to do.

57:49.420 --> 57:53.380
Maybe that's what we need to do here at Orange Toms Radio to get noticed because it's not

57:53.380 --> 57:54.380
working.

57:54.380 --> 57:55.380
No, I'm kidding.

57:55.380 --> 57:58.300
We need to call it Sexy Action Radio.

57:58.300 --> 58:06.260
skinny sexy guy radio, skinny sexy guy radio, there you go, that plays games occasionally.

58:06.260 --> 58:09.660
We have a comment from Seagurd in our chat room, he's the guy that actually works at

58:09.660 --> 58:12.820
Konami and what Seagurd did at Konami is he was one of the testers.

58:12.820 --> 58:16.660
Wait a minute, before you get going here, is this chat room just full of folks from

58:16.660 --> 58:17.660
Konami here?

58:17.660 --> 58:23.480
No, just the one, otherwise it's just fanboys and girls, just like the rest of us that just

58:23.480 --> 58:28.280
love the games, but Seagurd's one of those cases where he was someone that was a fan

58:28.280 --> 58:32.280
and then actually kind of got in the door and got to work on one of the games.

58:32.280 --> 58:33.280
That's cool.

58:33.280 --> 58:36.280
Yeah, he's a great guy. He's been on the show before, we like having him on.

58:36.280 --> 58:38.280
In fact, we might have him on later tonight.

58:38.280 --> 58:42.280
But he worked on the steps, actually, part of the steps for DDR,

58:42.280 --> 58:46.280
and he wanted you to know that the step creation team thought that your song

58:46.280 --> 58:49.280
was easily one of the top songs that they had to work with.

58:49.280 --> 58:51.280
So he just wanted to pass that along.

58:51.280 --> 58:53.280
Ah, that's great. Tell them thank you.

58:53.280 --> 58:55.280
I think he's listening, so hopefully you heard that.

58:55.280 --> 59:06.280
Oh, thank you. You're a sweet man. I love you. And no, I'm not gay. I mean that plutonically.

59:06.280 --> 59:14.280
What other artists from the different drum label have you collaborated with in the past?

59:14.280 --> 59:20.280
I've actually collaborated with a couple of them. I want to do more collaboration. I'll

59:20.280 --> 59:25.840
I'll just tell you that the artists I've done work with are neuro-active.

59:25.840 --> 59:34.920
I did a song with, his name is Jarco, and obviously he's not American.

59:34.920 --> 59:41.200
I did a song called, Fiber Optic Rhythm, and he sent me the music over the internet and

59:41.200 --> 59:46.280
I wrote the song, sent it back to him, he put it on the album.

59:46.280 --> 59:56.280
I haven't really done much collaboration.

59:56.280 --> 59:58.400
There's collaboration to be had, I know that.

59:58.400 --> 01:00:07.520
I've been speaking with Jeff Pinckney of The Nine, one of my other favorite ADD label artists.

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:15.400
He's actually working with me right now doing some music for my publisher.

01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:19.160
he and I will be collaborating on some stuff in the future.

01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:20.400
All right, cool.

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:22.640
Let's do one more question from our chat here.

01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:26.400
We have MJB wants to know, are there any other songs

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:29.200
in Bamani, which is what we call the music games that Konami

01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:32.820
puts out, including DDR and BBN2DX, et cetera.

01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:35.400
Are there any other songs you've considered remixing

01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:36.880
in the series?

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:39.360
Has doing this remix that you've already done

01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:42.480
kind of made you want to remix some other songs there

01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:43.760
in Bamani?

01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:49.920
Well, you know, asking me if I want to remix something is like asking me if I want to wake

01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:54.320
up in the morning and have breakfast.

01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:57.000
It's just a matter of choices.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:06.080
I've got a whole cabinet full of cereal, do I pick the corn checks or the wheat checks?

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:13.240
I'm not project-less, so I have my plate fairly full all the time with music projects.

01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:19.240
Doing music for television libraries keeps me fairly busy, and of course I have my day job.

01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:23.240
I don't really go out and seek after remix work.

01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:29.240
Remix work, if somebody needs something done, they'll usually ask me now.

01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:30.240
I used to have to seek it out.

01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:34.240
That's when you know you've made it big time, when they come find you.

01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:40.240
When you've made it big time, you've bought your home in Hollywood Hills.

01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:48.240
Right. Well, I was going to do it for the questions from our chat, but actually we wanted to kind of wrap up and go to a song.

01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:52.240
We're actually going to play something. I wasn't unfortunately, Midyhead, able to get that song that you sent me over email.

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:58.240
For some reason, my email is not coming up with a new message. So, I thought maybe we could play a track from Diving Asunder.

01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:02.240
I'm sorry, Dividing Asunder, actually. I thought maybe we could do a song from there.

01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:08.240
And, Midyhead, you're actually going to give some of our listeners some free stuff tonight, as I understand it?

01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:15.240
Yeah, actually we've got a couple of really great prizes to give away.

01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:22.240
We've got a deep-sea fishing in the Salt Lake, the Great Salt Lake.

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:29.240
We have some deep-sea carp fishing trips to give away.

01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:31.240
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:34.240
I don't think that was in the email I saw.

01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:39.240
Are you sure that wasn't like the Ryan Seacrest show or something?

01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:44.240
Ice fishing in Alaska.

01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:51.240
Actually, we're going to give away a couple of CD's from Dividing Asunder.

01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:54.240
A couple of monolithic CD's Dividing Asunder.

01:02:54.240 --> 01:03:13.240
And if you want, I'll also pick a couple of listeners to get some free downloads because I also host, you can purchase MP3s off of Midihead.com as well of my previous albums if you want to get them in electronic format.

01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:15.240
And Loki says he's already bought all three.

01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:16.240
Yep.

01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:17.240
All three albums.

01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:21.240
Dude, I appreciate you man, thank you.

01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:22.240

So send on over an email to freestuff at orangelaunchradio.com.

01:03:53.940 --> 01:03:56.040
Midi Head, thank you so much for being here on the show tonight.

01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:57.040
We appreciate it.

01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:58.040
Yeah, you're welcome, guys.

01:03:58.040 --> 01:03:59.040
It was a pleasure.

01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:00.560
Did anybody else hear in the room?

01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:02.080
It's been kind of quiet here in the room.

01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:03.520
I think we've just all been kind of...

01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:04.520
We've been absorbing.

01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:05.520
Yeah, Midi Head's so entertaining.

01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:06.520
We're like sponges.

01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:07.520
Absolutely.

01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:08.520
I hear crickets.

01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:10.520
What's going on over there?

01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:11.520
Oh, no.

01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:14.240
We're just...we're just...we're mesmerized by your every word.

01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:15.240
Fanboys.

01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:17.960
Oh, that was a safe answer.

01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:21.800
Alright, well we do appreciate you being here, wish you the best of luck, and I hope we get

01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:23.800
to talk to you again in the future, alright?

01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:24.800
I'm sure you will.

01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:26.440
Alright, well you take care of yourself, but...

01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:32.320
Have a good night, my love goes out to everyone listening, and have a happy holiday everyone.

01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:33.320
You too.

01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:34.320
Thanks.

01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:36.320
Alright, take care, big head, thank you.

01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:40.000
Alright, that was good, what a nice guy.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:45.720
I would like to say out there to our listeners, and I'm quoting, he uses acid.

01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:50.720
I'm fucking going on every Bimani board and saying he fucking uses acid, fuck you guys,

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:53.200
I'm entering the damn contest with acid.

01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:56.720
That's what I was trying to get at when I cut him off.

01:04:56.720 --> 01:05:01.360
How rude of me to cut the guy off while I'm interviewing him to make that very point,

01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:08.400
Loki, that the professionals are using acid, so shut up and let Loki use acid in the contest,

01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:09.400
people.

01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:13.720
All you have to do is just make a nice little sound clip out of it, post it on the board

01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:18.900

All right.

01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:52.200
Anyway, let's check out.

01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:55.000
Let's stop gushing for a minute here, and let's hear some music.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:58.680
We're going to hear a track from the CD we're giving away tonight, Dividing Asunder.

01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:03.200
This song is called Lulling Us to Sleep, which this show sometimes does to people, but not

01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:04.200
tonight.

01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:05.200
Not tonight.

01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:08.480
So we're going to hear this track, and we will be right back with more Orange Lounge

01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:15.480
radio.

01:06:38.480 --> 01:07:06.480
We are walking in our sleep, though our eyes are open, our slumber is so deep.

01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:11.480
We, it's our souls but gentle things

01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:15.480
A hypnotist has spoken

01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:18.480
A lullaby it sings

01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:25.480
Lost in our dreams of green and gold

01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:29.480
In the visions of our high years

01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:32.480
In the throne of wealth so bold

01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:31.360
Okay, sorry guys, we're having some technical difficulties there, I know bad me, that song

01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:33.360
The song is rockin' too. Sorry guys.

01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:35.360
Play it again.

01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:38.360
Internet radio is broke left and right. What can I say?

01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:40.360
Hold on. Let's try this again.

01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:43.360
No, that was my question also. Is Meaty Head singing this?

01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:46.360
I think so. I'm not sure. Sorry guys.

01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:49.360
And all familiar too

01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:53.360
That if the sun won't shine for us

01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:56.360
You're praying to the moon

01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:01.360
She's alive

01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:05.360
Without love

01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:08.360
We search to find her

01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:11.360
In one mop and rust

01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:20.360
The corrupt, deep in the arms Of the thought that mistakes me

01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:24.360
Something is the case

01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:31.360
Calling us to sleep like ladies

01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:47.360
Wake from a sleep that finds us down

01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:54.360
Look down to the higher, poorer of the crown

01:09:56.360 --> 01:10:01.360
See, there's a wellness in the heart

01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:05.360
A light that shines through darkness

01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:08.360
And breaks the chains apart

01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:18.360
What is a lie without love?

01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:23.360
Such a fine day in much more than rust

01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:28.360
Not to love deep in the arms

01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:32.360
But what's it to say?

01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:18.720

No, no, no, no, nothing. Well, eh, I guess one little thing to mention, um, BomaniStyle posted, if you guys are Guitar Freaks or Mania fans, they have the sim files for, um, Guitar Freaks, I think, one through ten, and you can get those in their media shop there, and it's, you know, it's got all your, uh, GDA files for, um, uh, DTX Mania, which is, you know, a sim, and, um, those type of things.

01:16:08.280 --> 01:16:14.640
So if you want more information, first off, download The Sims in the media shop on BOMAiStyle

01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:22.160
and check out their session forms, or session simulation forms on BOMAiStyle as well for

01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:26.320
all your information on how to actually use those sim files and play around with them.

01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:28.320
They're a lot of fun.

01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:30.480
Alright, very cool.

01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:32.780
This is a news story that's in right now.

01:16:32.780 --> 01:16:36.140
It doesn't really necessarily relate to DER completely, but I thought it was interesting

01:16:36.140 --> 01:16:38.780
because there's some games in here that are definitely worth mentioning.

01:16:38.780 --> 01:16:42.020
Time Magazine has announced their Top 10 Video Games of the Year.

01:16:42.020 --> 01:16:43.260
Are you guys ready to hear this?

01:16:43.260 --> 01:16:44.260
The Top 10 Video Games?

01:16:44.260 --> 01:16:45.260
Uh-oh.

01:16:45.260 --> 01:16:46.260
Uh-oh.

01:16:46.260 --> 01:16:52.100
And sorry guys, DDR, not on it, karaoke, not on it, Bomani, not on it.

01:16:52.100 --> 01:16:54.640
Well Karaoke Revolution did win it last year if I remember right.

01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:59.980
So you know, I guess it's Bomani's turn to take a back seat, I was going to say a back

01:16:59.980 --> 01:17:01.460
door, but that's not really it.

01:17:01.460 --> 01:17:02.460
Back seat.

01:17:02.460 --> 01:17:03.460
Oh no, no.

01:17:03.460 --> 01:17:06.460
Let's see what the top ten games are for this year.

01:17:06.460 --> 01:17:10.460
Here we go, number ten. Actually, these are in no particular order.

01:17:10.460 --> 01:17:12.460
They just named the top ten games here, I think.

01:17:12.460 --> 01:17:17.460
Maybe it was just worded wrong here on what I'm looking at.

01:17:17.460 --> 01:17:19.460
Oh, they are in order here. Let's have a look.

01:17:19.460 --> 01:17:21.460
Number ten, Pirates!

01:17:21.460 --> 01:17:24.460
R-M-E-D, it's Pirates!

01:17:24.460 --> 01:17:27.460
It's an adventure RPG game and I believe it's on the PC.

01:17:27.460 --> 01:17:28.460
Yeah, I think so.

01:17:28.460 --> 01:17:30.460
Pirates.

01:17:30.460 --> 01:17:32.460
Because I'd be confused with puzzle pirates.

01:17:32.460 --> 01:17:34.460
Not to be confused with puzzle pirates.

01:17:34.460 --> 01:17:38.460
Number nine, Fable for the Xbox, that role-playing game.

01:17:38.460 --> 01:17:42.460
That's the one where you can marry a guy in it if you play the cards right.

01:17:42.460 --> 01:17:44.460
Pretty awesome.

01:17:44.460 --> 01:17:50.460
Number eight, Burnout 3 Take Down, another racing and crashing game.

01:17:50.460 --> 01:17:52.460
Look, he's giving the thumbs up to that. Any particular reason?

01:17:52.460 --> 01:17:56.460
Well, the first one was awesome and this one looked really good, but I just have no interest in buying games.

01:17:56.460 --> 01:18:02.980
games. Number seven, and I'm actually surprised it's kind of low because everybody in the

01:18:02.980 --> 01:18:06.700
gaming community has a huge boner about Halo 2 is number seven.

01:18:06.700 --> 01:18:10.100
Wow, that low, huh? Yeah, I'm kind of surprised. So let's see

01:18:10.100 --> 01:18:16.620
what seven games, or six games are that beat Halo 2. Number six, Battlefield Vietnam. Yes,

01:18:16.620 --> 01:18:19.340
another shooting war game. I remember that one at E3.

01:18:19.340 --> 01:18:25.020
For your Xbox, yep. Yeah. Number five, and I'm surprised this one's

01:18:25.020 --> 01:18:32.200
kind of low too. Grand Theft Auto San Andreas. I think we all know that game. If you haven't

01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:35.860
heard about Grand Theft Auto, it's time to come out of your hole. Seriously? You get

01:18:35.860 --> 01:18:42.100
to take a construction foreman, knock him over inside a porta potty, then bury him alive

01:18:42.100 --> 01:18:48.740
inside cement. That's awesome. Wow. But not awesome enough to be under five. Just because

01:18:48.740 --> 01:18:55.740
he was making fun of your sister. So what rolled over Grand Theft Auto to land in fourth

01:18:55.840 --> 01:19:02.680
place? Katamari Damacy. Yay! Number four game. I know there's a lot of folks. Best underground

01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:09.680
hit ever. Honestly, it's the sleeper hit probably so far this decade. Seriously, it's the biggest

01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:15.960
sleeper hit I've ever seen. Number three, a little game you might have heard of, Half-Life

01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:22.960
Half-Life 2

01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:49.960
What do you mean you don't play strategy games? This is the best strategy game ever, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah.

01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:51.960
I'm so glad I don't have headphones right now.

01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:53.960
That sounds so lame.

01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:54.960
Rome Total War.

01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:55.960
Hey!

01:19:55.960 --> 01:20:06.960
Wait a second, wasn't that that stupid game that Capcom was pushing or something that was like, um, like some sort of, like, almost like Metal Gear Solid in Greek Roman times, you know?

01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:14.960
Was that, was that the game? Because that one looked really lame, and every time I saw it on their big screen, I'd laugh at it.

01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:17.960
Alright, you want to know what the number one game of the year is according to time?

01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:18.960
Wait, wait.

01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:19.960
I have to interrupt you real quick.

01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:20.960
Okay.

01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:21.960
Midi Head has joined us in our chat room.

01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:22.960
Really?

01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:23.960
Yes.

01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:24.960
Hey.

01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:25.960
Wow.

01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:30.640
Well, welcome, Midi Head, joining in the chat there, so go give him the same praise you

01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:34.440
were giving earlier while that song was playing, honestly, and play his ego a little more,

01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:35.440
please.

01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:36.440
I'm sure.

01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:40.120
Yeah, we'll send you a check for that, or, well, I mean, you can send us a check for

01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:43.520
that later, no.

01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:44.520
Number one.

01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:47.880
number one game of the year according to time magazine and I think Loki could

01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:51.240
possibly agree with this one I'm not sure based on the murder simulation he

01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:56.600
has created in number one the Sims 2 actually give the number one rating to

01:20:56.600 --> 01:21:00.680
because at e3 that just was phenomenal and what is coming out for the sims 2

01:21:00.680 --> 01:21:08.120
but not only the first expansion pack where the sims go to college did you not

01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:18.120
Yep, they go to college, they join in on SPRING BREAK frat parties, it is Sims 2 going to school.

01:21:20.120 --> 01:21:22.120
Do we get to get Sims drunk now?

01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:27.120
How many expansion packs are they going to make for this Sims game, honestly? How many did they do for-

01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:33.120
I'm waiting for the adult Ed Powers version, the hardcore.

01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:40.120
No, that'd be Playboy, the mansion game, you know, where you manage the Playboy mansion

01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:46.320
and just like watch chicks running around naked that are like stupid looking. That's

01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:53.320
about as fun as Leisure Suit Larry, the new one, which I beat, and I gotta say, it was

01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:55.040
kinda lame.

01:21:55.040 --> 01:21:58.680
Okay, was it at least enjoyable?

01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:03.680
It was enjoyable after I took the censorship off.

01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:08.680
You have to love any game though that allows you to be a sperm trying to make it through.

01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:13.680
And avoiding different blocks to try to make it through the egg.

01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:18.680
That was pretty funny.

01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:23.680
Any overlooked games you guys think for the top ten of the year?

01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:25.680
Besides Ultra Mix 2.

01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:26.680
Oh, look.

01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:32.680
God, you know, it's good that I've already made it because otherwise I would have been like WAH!

01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:36.680
Yeah, Metal Gear Solid 3.

01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:39.680
I'm actually a little bit surprised.

01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:46.680
I'm wondering if it was because the release date was so late that something such as Smackdown vs. Raw wouldn't have made it.

01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:50.680
Just because, I mean, it's amazing. It is utterly amazing.

01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:54.680
F that, rumble roses, where's my rumble roses?

01:22:54.680 --> 01:23:01.680
Yeah, but you have to admit that the play through mode, the story mode, oh my god, that's horrible.

01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:06.680
Even Seagert agrees with me in chat there, rumble roses was far overlooked for the top three.

01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:10.680
It was, but that, you know, the story mode is just...

01:23:10.680 --> 01:23:13.680
Although the game is getting horrible reviews, that's right.

01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:15.680
Oh come on!

01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:21.680
Sure, they give, you know, DOA beach volleyball good reviews, but no, this one actually has gameplay.

01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:30.680
Oh, it's interrupting my watching them walk around. Damn it. I actually have to play on this one? That sucks.

01:23:30.680 --> 01:23:32.680
It's interrupting the jiggle scenes, damn it.

01:23:32.680 --> 01:23:38.680
They should have DOA versus Rumble Roses and just like one all naked fest mud-wrestling game.

01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:39.680
There you go.

01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:40.680
There you go.

01:23:40.680 --> 01:23:41.680
I totally agree.

01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:44.680
Not enough nakedness in games, I guess.

01:23:44.680 --> 01:23:48.680
Where was the guy game?

01:23:48.680 --> 01:23:52.680
I have never played the guy game. I've only heard about this game. Have you played the guy game?

01:23:52.680 --> 01:23:56.680
Yes, I have to admit, I did rent it. What the hell is up with the guy game? Tell me about the guy game.

01:23:56.680 --> 01:24:00.680
Okay, the guy game was apparently filmed spring break last year

01:24:00.680 --> 01:24:04.680
at some place in Texas where they were just basically asking

01:24:04.680 --> 01:24:08.680
women trivia questions. And these women are dumb as rocks.

01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:12.680
Let's be honest here. And the first part of the game is

01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:16.540
to see, you know, which one of the four players will get it right, and then

01:24:16.540 --> 01:24:20.560
the second part is to figure out if the girl's gonna get it right,

01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:24.000
and if you figure that she's gonna get it, you know, right or wrong.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:27.760
The girl's never gonna get it right! I'm just kidding, I'm kidding. No, no, there's a few that actually do, and it's kind of scary.

01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:31.400
I'm kidding, I'm kidding. It's kind of scary. Isn't that stolen from Howard Stern?

01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:35.880
You saw, like, some other talk show, because I know this has been stolen, like, on numerous talk shows.

01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:40.280
Oh, you know, yeah, it obviously has, but there's this little meter

01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:44.280
that goes up, and at first it starts off, you know, if they get it wrong, they have to flash their tits.

01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:53.280
And so it first starts off with them flashing, and it has the guy game logo across their chest.

01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:59.280
You get the level up a little bit higher, and all of a sudden the logo disappears, but their boobies are pixelated.

01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:05.280
So it's kind of fuzzy, and then you get to the last level, where it's totally uncensored.

01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:17.280
And he could replay the level, and see all these girls topless, and it's just kind of head-scratching, mind-boggling, just what the hell are they thinking?

01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:19.280
Like BMX XXX?

01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:24.280
You know, I have that game, and I can't play it because it gives me motion sickness.

01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:30.280
I love that game. And the movies are awesome, and the final movies kick ass.

01:25:30.280 --> 01:25:34.280
Asian schoolgirl stripping.

01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:39.280
I'm surprised that this game isn't still number one today, seriously.

01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:41.280
But no, the guy game, oh my goodness.

01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:46.280
Yes, I'm shocked the guy game is not the number one game of the year. So shocked.

01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:51.280
Anyway, I think now's a good time to call it a break.

01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:56.280
Iguana Girl, I noticed you're purposefully quiet over there during discussions of the guy game.

01:25:56.280 --> 01:25:58.280
I was just telling Mitty he had goodbye.

01:25:58.280 --> 01:25:59.280
Oh, he left? He took off?

01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:00.280
He left.

01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:01.280
Did our chat room scare him off?

01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:04.600
I was being all nice to your guests and everything.

01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:08.200
All I know is I looked in the chat room and somebody said that they were jizzing their

01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:12.000
pants when they listened to the Midihead song, and I'm just like, I better not read anymore.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.880
Honestly, I better not read anymore.

01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:16.880
No, I love our listeners.

01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:17.880
They're great.

01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:23.720
He did mention that if you go to his site, I already scrolled up on my screen, but...

01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:24.720
Midihead.com is the site.

01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:25.720
Yeah.

01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:30.360
If you go to midihead.com and there's, I guess, the submit form that you can, he was going

01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:35.040
to give away some of those free downloads, and that's how you're going to do it.

01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:39.200
Okay, okay, so cool. You might be able to still see it on your screen. Head over there,

01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:42.920
do it. Alright, sounds good. We're going to take a break, when we come back from the break

01:26:42.920 --> 01:26:47.480
we'll do a little more chatting. I want to talk about Tycho, because they brought Tycho.

01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:51.240
I don't know if we're going to get a chance to play Tycho right now, but I want to get

01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:56.400
your thoughts on Tycho, certainly. We're not doing a cage match tonight, you guys. We can't

01:26:56.400 --> 01:27:01.240
to do a cage match tonight. We've got something else in store. And I'm going to tell you guys

01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:08.240
this much. It is not a cage match. It is not a reverse cage match. And Loki is crying.

01:27:09.380 --> 01:27:16.380
Find out when we come back. 2DX11 music coming your way. We'll be back. Or 2DX Red I should

01:27:16.380 --> 01:27:23.380
I should say. Sorry, fanboys.

01:28:16.380 --> 01:28:20.240
...

01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:24.240
...

01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:28.240
...

01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:32.240
...

01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:36.240
...

01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:40.240
...

01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:44.240
...

01:31:14.240 --> 01:31:14.740
Hey!

01:32:44.740 --> 01:32:53.240
Oh, you said, oh, oh, we were born again

01:32:53.240 --> 01:32:58.240
We are here, yes, I will be

01:32:58.240 --> 01:33:07.240
We were born again, oh, oh, we were born again

01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:17.240
um

01:33:29.240 --> 01:33:32.420
h Building

01:33:32.420 --> 01:33:42.420
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:33:42.420 --> 01:33:50.420
By the way, that video is great.

01:33:50.420 --> 01:33:52.420
I finally watched it.

01:33:52.420 --> 01:33:58.420
Anyway, Midyhead actually sent me an email during the break there and he wants you guys to know that yes, that was him singing in that song.

01:33:58.420 --> 01:34:02.420
For those of you guys that want to know if that was his voice, yes, that was his name.

01:34:02.420 --> 01:34:06.420
And he's sending me a new song of his to play.

01:34:06.420 --> 01:34:10.420
Very cool. And we'll be playing that at the end of the show. Looking forward to that.

01:34:10.420 --> 01:34:14.420
Don't forget guys, free stuff at Orangelaundry.com. And if you missed the

01:34:14.420 --> 01:34:18.420
interview tonight or any part of it, don't worry, you get a second chance.

01:34:18.420 --> 01:34:22.420
You get second helpings thanks to DER Freak Radio who's going to be

01:34:22.420 --> 01:34:26.420
rebroadcasting it on December 10th. December 10th, yeah. 6 o'clock. As they do

01:34:26.420 --> 01:34:31.820
our little show over there. Orange Lounge Radio Rewind. Yep so very cool and of

01:34:31.820 --> 01:34:35.380
course some of you guys may be thinking well didn't you guys used to do the

01:34:35.380 --> 01:34:39.460
rewinds on your own damn station Sky? Yeah actually that's true but now it is

01:34:39.460 --> 01:34:44.120
the oldie and moldy Wednesday flashback where we are 100 episodes behind right

01:34:44.120 --> 01:34:47.020
now so you can hear what the show sounded like two years ago it's pretty

01:34:47.020 --> 01:34:51.440
nuts. I kind of looked at the chat and some of the response to last week's

01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:55.140
episode and I think I think Misty or somebody had said it's a good thing I

01:34:55.140 --> 01:35:00.100
wasn't there, because I would have ripped him a new asshole. So here are what offensive

01:35:00.100 --> 01:35:04.280
things you missed out on back on episodes 20 and 21 and all that stuff we're playing

01:35:04.280 --> 01:35:12.280
way back when, so check it out. Alright, so we're going to get to our, not a cage match,

01:35:12.280 --> 01:35:16.160
but something a little different in a little bit, but I wanted to talk first about Taiko

01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:20.840
Drum Master. It's a game that kind of came out there under our noses. I know we got to

01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:24.240
it out of E3 and we told you guys a little bit about it.

01:35:24.240 --> 01:35:28.980
Huge game in Japan called Taiko no Tatujin in Japan, basically for those who don't know

01:35:28.980 --> 01:35:29.980
what it's about.

01:35:29.980 --> 01:35:30.980
It's about taiko drumming.

01:35:30.980 --> 01:35:34.120
You have these big things that look like breadsticks and you beat the drum.

01:35:34.120 --> 01:35:36.720
You beat it in the center and you beat it in the side.

01:35:36.720 --> 01:35:39.600
So popular in Japan, it was the number one selling game in Japan for a while that they

01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:43.520
decided to bring it over to the US, call it Taiko Drum Master.

01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:46.000
And Aguana Grow, you guys actually picked up a copy of it, right?

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:51.520
We purchased a copy over at our local Fry's Electronics for $60.

01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:53.960
That includes the game and the drum.

01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:56.080
And we're absolutely loving it.

01:35:56.080 --> 01:35:57.200
Some assembly required.

01:35:57.200 --> 01:35:58.400
Yeah, some assembly required.

01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:00.840
They have little things to put on the bottom

01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:02.560
so that you can kind of lift up the drum.

01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:03.560
Oh, that's not that bad.

01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:04.640
Yeah.

01:36:04.640 --> 01:36:07.280
Nothing that a two-year-old can't figure out.

01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:11.400
Kind of slot A into slot B type of thing.

01:36:11.400 --> 01:36:14.760
And the music selection is excellent.

01:36:14.760 --> 01:36:22.600
For those who are Katamari fans, there is one song that is, yeah, Katamari on the Rocks,

01:36:22.600 --> 01:36:23.600
that is...

01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:30.520
Oh, God, who doesn't know that song that's playing that game?

01:36:30.520 --> 01:36:32.440
And that's a lot of fun.

01:36:32.440 --> 01:36:40.560
And the ironic thing is that there's actually several songs that were the more traditional,

01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:47.920
the classical songs like, you know, Hungarian Dance and stuff like that.

01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:48.920
Yeah.

01:36:48.920 --> 01:36:50.920
Symphony No. 5, Hungarian Dance.

01:36:50.920 --> 01:36:55.400
By the way, I just want to talk about how scary it was that we all burst into song on

01:36:55.400 --> 01:36:56.400
the Katamari Damacy record.

01:36:56.400 --> 01:36:57.400
A little bit scary there.

01:36:57.400 --> 01:37:03.880
Well, I mean, I think that song is just so great because, I mean, just for the da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da

01:37:03.880 --> 01:37:04.880
dance.

01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:06.160
The song is a stroke of genius.

01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:10.920
but those were some songs that we actually got to play at E3

01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:14.880
and that was on the... actually that was on the Taeko no Tastujin

01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:16.480
original setup

01:37:16.480 --> 01:37:19.960
but it was more like the crossover, you know, this is the E3 version of the

01:37:19.960 --> 01:37:21.240
American game

01:37:21.240 --> 01:37:22.200
but

01:37:22.200 --> 01:37:25.120
actually the music list is pretty decent

01:37:25.120 --> 01:37:28.480
we've only managed to get 31 songs, I don't know if there's further

01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:31.680
I think that's the max, we have unlocked the Oni mode

01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:42.680
Ooh, Oni Mode. It is Oni Mode. Now, I have to ask, or else Rice Princess and Lanky Style would kill me, because this is an inside joke from outside the box, but My Sharona is in the game, correct?

01:37:42.680 --> 01:37:55.680
Yes. Okay, just double-check. It is in the game. Okay. There's also, wasn't Love Shack in that? Yes. Yeah. Love Shack is also in that game. I like that song. Yeah.

01:37:55.680 --> 01:38:00.680
Are you going to be my girl?

01:38:00.680 --> 01:38:02.680
Yeah, that's Ross's favorite.

01:38:02.680 --> 01:38:04.680
That one's a lot of fun.

01:38:04.680 --> 01:38:07.680
A lot, a lot of fun.

01:38:07.680 --> 01:38:10.680
There's a Queen song in there, Killer Queen.

01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:17.680
All sorts of songs from Namco's own games, like the theme song from Soul Calibur, Ridge Racer.

01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:22.680
I remember that the Soul Calibur song, whatever it's called, it's one of the stages.

01:38:22.680 --> 01:38:26.040
Brave, brave sword, braver soul, yeah, whatever.

01:38:26.040 --> 01:38:26.720
But that's cool.

01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:29.480
But yeah, it's a good overall mix of music.

01:38:29.480 --> 01:38:37.040
I mean, they've got a lot of American songs mixed in with the classical stuff

01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:39.320
and with their own versions of stuff.

01:38:39.320 --> 01:38:42.200
Like they have Tycho March and stuff like that.

01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:44.400
So do you think that the kids that are upset that there's

01:38:44.400 --> 01:38:47.240
been no US Beatmania as of yet, do you think that this

01:38:47.240 --> 01:38:49.840
might hold them over a little bit?

01:38:49.840 --> 01:38:56.720
Maybe it's more, yeah, it's more, you know, like the, if you were to get this and Donkey

01:38:56.720 --> 01:39:00.080
Konga, then you've got like your whole drum mania thing worked out right there.

01:39:00.080 --> 01:39:02.280
Okay, so it's more like a drum mania.

01:39:02.280 --> 01:39:09.040
That's another ironic bit is that the classical stuff that is in Donkey Konga is, you know,

01:39:09.040 --> 01:39:11.500
the same stuff that's in Taiko Drum Masters.

01:39:11.500 --> 01:39:18.480
So you could either choose to play the stuff on the bongos or on the taiko drums.

01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:19.480
Just all up to you.

01:39:19.480 --> 01:39:26.480
Something for everyone, except Katamari on the rocks is not in.

01:39:26.480 --> 01:39:31.480
Alright guys, do we have everything set up over here that we need?

01:39:31.480 --> 01:39:35.480
Is something wrong?

01:39:35.480 --> 01:39:40.480
Okay, he's saying the webcam. I don't care about the webcam, we've got to get the other stuff though.

01:39:40.480 --> 01:39:45.480
We are going to get to tonight's cage match boys and girls, it's time for your favorite segment of the show.

01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:49.960
the show okay maybe not but it is the mandatory segment we do every week orange

01:39:49.960 --> 01:39:56.480
lounge cage match where we pitch three songs against each other head-to-head

01:39:56.480 --> 01:40:02.160
and we see who the winner is you guys vote and your favorite song goes into

01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:07.200
rotation all week long on orange lounge radios 24 hour a day seven days a week

01:40:07.200 --> 01:40:14.600
Lamani music and more program so let's see last week's winner was a little song

01:40:14.600 --> 01:40:18.800
here it was actually a top 40 song that's won the contest for a couple

01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:26.280
weeks now it's been winning for a little while now and it's called it's by Gwen

01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:34.680
Stefani and I'm trying to yep what you waiting for is the song this is a clip

01:40:34.680 --> 01:40:41.680
of last week's winner, Whatchu waiting for?

01:40:57.200 --> 01:41:00.160
Okay, that was enough of a clip. So,

01:41:00.160 --> 01:41:05.280
the question is do we do another cage match tonight without dark Sakura

01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:13.380
present no unfortunately we will not be doing a normal cage match tonight so

01:41:13.380 --> 01:41:16.780
Gwen Stefani wins another week by default because if we did a cage match

01:41:16.780 --> 01:41:21.000
without dark Sakura there'd be hell to pay

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:29.720
instead of pissing off Jamie we're gonna piss off Loki because pissing off Loki

01:41:29.720 --> 01:41:44.040
is funnier by doing a drum roll please karaoke cage match alright guys here's

01:41:44.040 --> 01:41:49.640
the way the karaoke cage match is gonna work just like the typical cage match

01:41:49.640 --> 01:41:52.960
where there's gonna be three songs so you're gonna get to pick from and the

01:41:52.960 --> 01:41:56.680
favorite that you pick will go into rotation all week long on orange lounge

01:41:56.680 --> 01:42:03.280
radio just like any other song all right but the deal is is that instead of it

01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:07.640
being songs that are out there you know and it's like just songs that we pick

01:42:07.640 --> 01:42:11.640
out of the blue like we usually do they will be songs sung by folks in the

01:42:11.640 --> 01:42:17.800
studio tonight via karaoke revolution volume 3 and this is a good way for us

01:42:17.800 --> 01:42:23.800
to check out this game as well so now you see why Loki's pissed

01:42:23.800 --> 01:42:29.800
all night, do not do this segment, do not do the damn segment, do not do the damn segment.

01:42:29.800 --> 01:42:36.800
Too bad. Alright, so who's going to start off tonight? Me and you are going to go on

01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:39.800
a girl, you want to start it off? If you want. Alright, let's start it off, we're going to

01:42:39.800 --> 01:42:42.800
start off. Alright, we're going to go over to karaoke revolution volume 3, and I'm going

01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:45.800
to give the mic to Loki so he can vent a little bit of his anger while we set up for song

01:42:45.800 --> 01:42:50.800
number 1. To hell with all you people, I should have never bought that damn game. Fuck my

01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:57.800
my girlfriend. I know. God dammit. I don't like this game very much. Alright. What do

01:42:57.800 --> 01:43:02.800
God dammit.

01:43:02.800 --> 01:43:07.800
I don't like this game very much.

01:43:07.800 --> 01:43:12.800
Alright.

01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:17.800
What do we got?

01:43:17.800 --> 01:43:22.800
So what are you going to play?

01:43:22.800 --> 01:43:30.080
And the love shack, and the do what?

01:43:30.080 --> 01:43:36.760
Wanna girl and I are going to do love shack, so is it going to pick up over the mics here

01:43:36.760 --> 01:43:38.480
or do we need to have the mics here by the way?

01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:43.400
It will pick up over the mics, no it will pick up over the mics.

01:43:43.400 --> 01:43:50.800
The love shack is a little old place where we can get together.

01:43:50.800 --> 01:43:52.800
Don't worry about me.

01:43:52.800 --> 01:43:54.800
All right.

01:43:54.800 --> 01:43:56.800
I love karaoke revolution.

01:43:56.800 --> 01:43:58.800
I dislike this game.

01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:02.800
The hell with you people.

01:44:02.800 --> 01:44:03.800
It's a true duet.

01:44:03.800 --> 01:44:05.800
How come the male vocalist is a chick? That's what I want to know.

01:44:05.800 --> 01:44:07.800
I don't know.

01:44:08.800 --> 01:44:10.800
Enter.

01:44:11.800 --> 01:44:13.800
Yeah, he can do it.

01:44:13.800 --> 01:44:14.800
No.

01:44:14.800 --> 01:44:29.200
If you see a faded sign at the side of the road that says 15 miles to the sunshine, sunshine

01:44:29.200 --> 01:44:55.560
I got me a car, it's as big as a whale We're headin' on down to the love shack

01:44:55.560 --> 01:45:02.560
I got me a Chrysler, it seats about twenty, so hurry up and bring your 2-box money!

01:45:02.560 --> 01:45:11.560
Yeah, a love shack is a little old place where we can get together

01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:15.560
A love shack baby

01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:17.560
A love shack baby

01:45:17.560 --> 01:45:20.560
A love shack baby, love shack

01:45:20.560 --> 01:45:24.560
A love shack baby, love shack

01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:31.560
More than you'd have for a child More than you'd have for a child

01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:38.560
Stay away, it's the love, it's the love child

01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:41.560
We're back, we're back In the middle of a field

01:45:41.560 --> 01:45:45.560
There's a funky old shack And I got a good time

01:45:45.560 --> 01:45:52.560
Glitter on the mountain Glitter on the highway

01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:59.560
Glitter on the front porch Glitter on the highway

01:45:59.560 --> 01:46:08.560
And the sunshine's in the middle of nowhere We can get together

01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:12.560
Love Shack, baby

01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:14.560
Love Shack, baby

01:46:14.560 --> 01:46:17.560
Love Shack, that's what it's at

01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:21.560
Love Shack, that's what it's at

01:46:21.560 --> 01:46:25.560
Huggin' and a-kissin', dancin' and a-lovin'

01:46:25.560 --> 01:46:28.560
Wearin' X to nothin' cause it's hot as an oven

The whole shack shimmy

01:46:31.560 --> 01:46:35.560
Yeah, the whole shack shimmy

01:46:35.560 --> 01:46:42.560
The whole shimmy when everybody's moving around and around and around and around

01:46:57.560 --> 01:47:11.560
Up in my Chrysler, it's as big as a whale, and it's about to get swale.

01:47:11.560 --> 01:47:19.560
I got me a car, it can speak about twenty-two, and it brings your two-foot bunny.

01:47:19.560 --> 01:47:23.640
With our love shots in the middle Hey chan

01:47:23.640 --> 01:47:28.400
We can get together

01:47:28.400 --> 01:47:31.800
Love shot baby

01:47:31.800 --> 01:47:34.080
Have loves movies

01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:37.400
No shot baby, no shot

01:47:37.400 --> 01:47:41.040
Love shot baby, no shot

01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:44.680
Love shot baby, no shot

01:47:44.680 --> 01:47:48.680
That's right, baby, that's where it's at

01:47:51.680 --> 01:47:52.680
Yeehaw

01:48:02.680 --> 01:48:06.680
Bang, bang, bang on the door, baby

01:48:07.680 --> 01:48:09.680
Knock a little louder, Spadeen

01:48:09.680 --> 01:48:13.680
Bang, bang, bang on the door, baby

01:48:13.680 --> 01:48:15.680
My shoulder

01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:45.680
On the door!

01:48:45.680 --> 01:48:47.680
Bang bang!

01:48:47.680 --> 01:48:49.680
On the door, baby!

01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:51.680
Bang bang!

01:48:51.680 --> 01:48:53.680
You're all done!

01:48:53.680 --> 01:48:55.680
Cheers!

01:48:57.680 --> 01:49:01.680
Bloodshot, baby, no shame!

01:49:01.680 --> 01:49:05.680
Bloodshot, baby, no shame!

01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:09.680
Bloodshot, baby, no shame!

01:49:09.680 --> 01:49:33.680
Let's go around the room and see what everybody thought of that.

01:49:33.680 --> 01:49:36.680
I'm getting some feedback there from the chatroom, we'll see.

01:49:36.680 --> 01:49:39.680
Alright, let's go around the room and see what everybody thought of that.

01:49:39.680 --> 01:49:41.680
Starting with Islander.

01:49:41.680 --> 01:49:43.680
That was good performance.

01:49:43.680 --> 01:49:46.680
And on a scale of one to ten?

01:49:46.680 --> 01:49:48.680
Seven point five to eight.

01:49:48.680 --> 01:49:49.680
Loki.

01:49:49.680 --> 01:49:54.680
I give it a zero because you have the dumbest fucking segment ever.

01:49:54.680 --> 01:49:59.680
To hell with you, I'm never letting you run a show ever again by yourself.

01:49:59.680 --> 01:50:01.680
No.

01:50:01.680 --> 01:50:03.680
Hey baby, Ted!

01:50:03.680 --> 01:50:05.680
Aw, you're just kissing my ass.

01:50:05.680 --> 01:50:07.680
Jonas, you just walked in. Expose it.

01:50:09.680 --> 01:50:11.680
Okay, I just walked in, and I...

01:50:11.680 --> 01:50:13.680
I have to say it's five.

01:50:13.680 --> 01:50:15.680
It's for...

01:50:15.680 --> 01:50:17.680
For good...

01:50:17.680 --> 01:50:19.680
Okay, let's play it first, but that'll be my risk for it a bit.

01:50:22.680 --> 01:50:24.680
Hey, what the hell's with the granny?

01:50:24.680 --> 01:50:26.680
What the hell?

01:50:26.680 --> 01:50:28.680
What?

01:50:28.680 --> 01:50:30.680
Granny's rockin'.

01:50:30.680 --> 01:50:33.680
Alright, Islander's next. What song are you going to sing for us, Islander?

01:50:33.680 --> 01:50:36.680
Oh lord, let me take a look at the list here. Uh oh.

01:50:36.680 --> 01:50:39.680
Not that list. Wrong.

01:50:39.680 --> 01:50:41.680
Let's try this again.

01:50:41.680 --> 01:51:06.760
It's going through and finding a song right now, what he wants to sing.

01:51:06.760 --> 01:51:09.520
He's thinking about the Fugees but passed on it.

01:51:09.520 --> 01:51:16.520
and

01:51:18.520 --> 01:51:21.680
abc

01:51:21.680 --> 01:51:23.240
against all odds is in there

01:51:23.240 --> 01:51:26.040
you guys know that one from ddr

01:51:26.040 --> 01:51:29.880
thinking about who the fake

01:51:29.880 --> 01:51:31.400
he's giving his not

01:51:31.400 --> 01:51:34.280
any hit the x button you stuck with it now

01:51:34.280 --> 01:51:37.280
Islander, song number two in tonight's cage match.

01:51:37.280 --> 01:51:40.280
Wrong way.

01:51:40.280 --> 01:51:43.280
My check, my check.

01:51:43.280 --> 01:51:44.280
We good.

01:51:44.280 --> 01:51:46.280
All right, song number two in tonight's cage match.

01:51:46.280 --> 01:51:49.280
Islander, the reason.

01:51:49.280 --> 01:51:54.280
I wish this was volume one because in that song I could do, oh hell,

01:51:54.280 --> 01:51:56.280
from vertical horizon.

01:51:56.280 --> 01:52:20.280
I'm not a perfect person There's many things I wish I didn't do

01:52:20.280 --> 01:52:25.280
I said that, but it's good I present it to you

01:52:27.280 --> 01:52:32.280
I never meant to do the things to you

01:52:33.280 --> 01:52:38.280
And so I have to save it for a girl

01:52:39.280 --> 01:52:44.280
That I just wanted to know

01:52:44.280 --> 01:52:56.280
I found a reason for me To change who I used to be

01:52:56.280 --> 01:53:08.280
A reason to start over new And the reason is new

01:53:08.280 --> 01:53:13.280
Don't believe that I hurt you

01:53:13.280 --> 01:53:19.280
It's nothing I must've worked for today

01:53:19.280 --> 01:53:25.280
And all the pain I put you through

01:53:25.280 --> 01:53:31.280
I wish that I could take it all away

01:53:31.280 --> 01:53:37.280
And be the one who catches all your tears

01:53:37.280 --> 01:53:42.280
That's why I needed you here

01:53:42.280 --> 01:53:48.280
I found out a reason for me

01:53:48.280 --> 01:53:54.280
It changed who I used to be

01:53:54.280 --> 01:54:01.280
A reason to start over new

01:54:01.280 --> 01:54:06.280
The elementary isn't...

01:54:07.280 --> 01:54:12.280
The elementary isn't...

01:54:13.280 --> 01:54:18.280
The elementary isn't...

01:54:19.280 --> 01:54:24.280
The elementary isn't...

01:54:24.280 --> 01:54:40.280
I'm not a perfect person, I never meant to do those things to you

01:54:40.280 --> 01:54:46.280
And so I have to stay with forever

01:54:46.280 --> 01:54:51.280
That I just wanted to know

01:54:51.280 --> 01:54:57.280
I found a reason for me

01:54:57.280 --> 01:55:03.280
To change who I used to be

01:55:03.280 --> 01:55:10.280
A reason that's not over new

01:55:10.280 --> 01:55:15.280
And the reason is new

01:55:15.280 --> 01:55:21.280
I found a reason to show

01:55:21.280 --> 01:55:27.280
A sign of me you may know

01:55:27.280 --> 01:55:33.280
A reason for all that I do

01:55:33.280 --> 01:55:39.280
A reason is you

01:55:39.280 --> 01:55:47.280
All the girls there are swooning for Islander.

01:55:47.280 --> 01:55:49.840
I know that was painful for a lot of people to listen to because it was painful for me

01:55:49.840 --> 01:55:50.840
to sing.

01:55:50.840 --> 01:55:51.840
That's right.

01:55:51.840 --> 01:55:53.840
Let's go around and see what everybody thought of that.

01:55:53.840 --> 01:55:54.840
Iguana Girl.

01:55:54.840 --> 01:55:55.840
I still love you.

01:55:55.840 --> 01:55:56.840
It's okay.

01:55:56.840 --> 01:55:57.840
Yay.

01:55:57.840 --> 01:56:02.080
It was a little quiet, but I dug it.

01:56:02.080 --> 01:56:08.240
I think you would get girls throwing their panties at you any day.

01:56:08.240 --> 01:56:10.240
tonight if you're lucky. I give it a 7.

01:56:10.240 --> 01:56:12.240
That might be wrong!

01:56:12.240 --> 01:56:14.240
Loki.

01:56:14.240 --> 01:56:16.240
I give one more finger up to Rob.

01:56:16.240 --> 01:56:18.240
That is it.

01:56:18.240 --> 01:56:20.240
That wasn't painful.

01:56:20.240 --> 01:56:22.240
Just give it a couple more minutes.

01:56:24.240 --> 01:56:26.240
I fucking hate this.

01:56:26.240 --> 01:56:28.240
Angel. Hey, that was really good.

01:56:28.240 --> 01:56:30.240
I'm going to give it an 8 just because

01:56:30.240 --> 01:56:32.240
I can.

01:56:32.240 --> 01:56:34.240
Well, I don't have anything to say.

01:56:34.240 --> 01:56:36.240
It was good.

01:56:36.240 --> 01:56:44.240
There's a couple parts that, you know, did get choked on, but it's all good. It was really good, and you almost sounded like the real guy, so that's cool.

01:56:44.240 --> 01:56:48.240
All right. All right, Loki. What song is Loki gonna sing?

01:56:48.240 --> 01:56:49.240
No.

01:56:49.240 --> 01:56:54.240
Huh? Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, explicit. When he walked in, he was tardy. What can you do?

01:56:54.240 --> 01:56:58.240
I know, I know. Well, I'll be Stick Judge from Simon's View.

01:56:58.240 --> 01:57:02.240
Okay. I don't wanna fuckin' play this.

01:57:02.240 --> 01:57:07.240
Well, you did choke on some parts, but you did pretty good.

01:57:07.240 --> 01:57:09.240
Give it a 7.5.

01:57:09.240 --> 01:57:13.980
the next round all right here comes Loki and he's so excited to be performing

01:57:13.980 --> 01:57:21.960

heater unlocked, because at least that song will be fun.

01:57:45.760 --> 01:58:02.760
See, that's why I like it. That's why I like it.

01:58:02.760 --> 01:58:15.160

It wasn't funny the second time we tried it. It's not going to be funny the third time.

01:58:53.900 --> 01:58:55.900
Oh my.

01:59:00.900 --> 01:59:01.900
Test, test, test.

01:59:01.900 --> 01:59:03.900

We did get one Loki sucks in the chat room.

01:59:20.900 --> 01:59:23.900
What person would come and sit?

01:59:23.900 --> 01:59:28.900
He's still not the Rob and I fucking hate him.

01:59:28.900 --> 01:59:32.900

You're more than just friends Oh baby, it might seem like a crush

01:59:53.900 --> 01:59:59.900
But it doesn't mean that I'm serious

01:59:59.900 --> 02:00:00.900
Ah, fuck this!

02:00:00.900 --> 02:00:05.400
Let's lose all my senses

02:00:05.400 --> 02:00:09.400
I'm really sorry to the children today

02:00:09.400 --> 02:00:14.400
Once you are high, take your fucking gun

02:00:14.400 --> 02:00:17.400
Make a piece of what you've done

02:00:17.400 --> 02:00:19.400
Don't touch it

02:00:19.400 --> 02:00:24.400
I wanna be the baby first to think I'm in love

02:00:54.400 --> 02:00:59.400
Dances have such so typically me

02:00:59.400 --> 02:01:04.400
Oh baby, if I did it again

I'd play the two games

02:01:07.400 --> 02:01:09.400
Not lost in the game

02:01:09.400 --> 02:01:11.400
I just awaited

02:01:11.400 --> 02:01:13.400
Why do I sing this song?

02:01:13.400 --> 02:01:14.400
What?

02:01:14.400 --> 02:01:18.400
That's it from above

02:01:18.400 --> 02:01:21.400
I'm not that innocent

02:01:21.400 --> 02:01:28.400

I'm not that interested

02:01:52.200 --> 02:01:55.200
Oops, I did it again

02:01:55.200 --> 02:01:58.200
I sang a great song

02:01:58.200 --> 02:02:00.200
People laughing in the rain

02:02:00.200 --> 02:02:02.200
Ooh, baby, baby

02:02:02.200 --> 02:02:05.200
Oops, you think that you said

02:02:05.200 --> 02:02:09.200
When you go to sleep

02:02:09.200 --> 02:02:12.200
But they're all through with the first turn

02:02:12.200 --> 02:02:15.200
Oops, I did it again

02:02:15.200 --> 02:02:18.200
I had to hide their bodies

02:02:18.200 --> 02:02:22.200
It's time we're away, covering the way

02:02:22.200 --> 02:02:25.200
Oops, you think it's a good time

02:02:25.200 --> 02:02:29.200
And I'm not about to stand here tonight

02:02:29.200 --> 02:02:32.200
I've stuck it, I'm not even trying at all

02:02:35.200 --> 02:02:37.200
I fucking hate this game!

02:02:37.200 --> 02:02:39.200
God damn you, Konami!

02:02:39.200 --> 02:02:41.200
God damn you!

02:02:41.200 --> 02:02:56.200
You know, the listeners are going to vote this number one for a week on end.

02:02:56.200 --> 02:02:58.600
Let's go around the room and see what everybody thought of that one, starting with the Guana

02:02:58.600 --> 02:02:59.600
Girl.

02:02:59.600 --> 02:03:00.600
I thought it was fabulous.

02:03:00.600 --> 02:03:03.520
Oh my god, I just can't believe it.

02:03:03.520 --> 02:03:04.520
It's a ten.

02:03:04.520 --> 02:03:05.520
It's a ten.

02:03:05.520 --> 02:03:06.520
Islander.

02:03:06.520 --> 02:03:09.520
It was so fabulous, I created my pants.

02:03:09.520 --> 02:03:24.880
I think he was one of those that got, you know, attacked with a butcher knife, and...

02:03:24.880 --> 02:03:25.880
He's like, ugh!

02:03:25.880 --> 02:03:26.880
He's alive!

02:03:26.880 --> 02:03:38.400
Uh, as for my thoughts, I give it a ten, and can I sleep over at your place tonight?

02:03:38.400 --> 02:03:39.400
Wanna go home?

02:03:39.400 --> 02:04:01.840
We'll be right back, boys and girls.

02:04:01.840 --> 02:04:07.960
The FUs of the week are coming up pretty soon, although now I'm having second thoughts.

02:04:07.960 --> 02:04:14.960
We'll be back after this.

02:04:37.960 --> 02:04:39.960
And you, I need to

02:04:39.960 --> 02:04:41.960
Step by step by step

02:04:41.960 --> 02:04:43.960
I don't want to talk about it

02:04:43.960 --> 02:04:45.960
Talk about it now, I need to

02:04:45.960 --> 02:04:47.960
Move my body, move my body

02:04:47.960 --> 02:04:49.960
It's coming for me

02:04:49.960 --> 02:04:51.960
You love me

02:04:51.960 --> 02:04:53.960
Let's make a happy ride

02:04:53.960 --> 02:04:55.960
On to the beat

02:04:55.960 --> 02:04:56.960
We got to move your head

02:04:56.960 --> 02:04:58.960
You got me

02:04:58.960 --> 02:05:00.960
This is the time to move your feet

02:05:00.960 --> 02:05:02.960
We got to let you go

02:05:02.960 --> 02:05:04.960
You love me

02:05:04.960 --> 02:05:05.960
Let's make a happy ride

02:05:05.960 --> 02:05:12.960
We've got to move your head and do something We've got to let you come on your feet

02:05:12.960 --> 02:05:14.960
We've got to let them go

02:05:14.960 --> 02:05:15.460
Go!

02:05:15.460 --> 02:05:16.460
Give it all back!

02:05:16.460 --> 02:05:17.460
I'm on fire!

02:05:17.460 --> 02:05:18.460
Give it up for...

02:05:27.460 --> 02:05:28.460
Give it up for...

02:05:31.460 --> 02:05:32.460
9-1-1

02:05:32.460 --> 02:06:00.460
Welcome to the brocco, welcome to the family tonight

02:06:00.460 --> 02:06:06.460
Come on, lady, come on, girl Come on, lady, tell me what's right

02:06:06.460 --> 02:06:14.460
Not the danger, not the big stranger Rock it, rock it, what you gonna do?

02:06:14.460 --> 02:06:18.460
I'm gonna make my day and I'll fix it if you know how hard it is

02:06:18.460 --> 02:06:22.460
Do you think I'm perfect? Yeah, night's on fire

02:06:22.460 --> 02:06:25.460
You better, better think You better, better think

02:07:25.460 --> 02:07:30.460
Baby, I don't want to die, you won't get it

02:07:30.460 --> 02:07:33.460
If there was no better place, baby

02:07:33.460 --> 02:07:36.460
Say hello to me, cause I wanna see

02:07:36.460 --> 02:07:40.460
Wanna see the color of the blue eyes, baby

02:07:40.460 --> 02:07:43.460
This is the night, when we see the light

02:07:43.460 --> 02:07:46.460
I'll set fire burning in my heart for your big love

02:07:46.460 --> 02:07:49.460
Gotta break, medicate, do something special

02:07:49.460 --> 02:07:52.460
This is the dedication of the magic moment

02:08:22.460 --> 02:08:46.980
Orange Lounge Radio, we put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.

02:08:46.980 --> 02:09:03.500
It's time to reveal the winner of tonight's cage match.

02:09:03.500 --> 02:09:08.380
And the winner of tonight's cage match is Loki with Oops I Did It Again.

02:09:08.380 --> 02:09:11.220
Why are we all surprised?

02:09:11.220 --> 02:09:12.220
You know what though?

02:09:12.220 --> 02:09:16.820
The other two songs got a surprising amount of pity votes, so I was very pleased.

02:09:16.820 --> 02:09:20.260
The effort did not go unappreciated by the rest of us.

02:09:20.260 --> 02:09:22.620
We knew that Loki was going to cream us though.

02:09:22.620 --> 02:09:26.100
Can I have a hug, Loki?

02:09:26.100 --> 02:09:27.100
No!

02:09:27.100 --> 02:09:31.660
He's taking off his aggressions on Mario 64 right now, so what can you do?

02:09:31.660 --> 02:09:33.780
I know, like, what is that?

02:09:33.780 --> 02:09:40.020
Why are you holding two DS's over there, Angel?

02:09:40.020 --> 02:09:41.580
You guys are crazy.

02:09:41.580 --> 02:09:42.580
Alright.

02:09:42.580 --> 02:09:46.700
Congratulations, Loki, for winning tonight's cage match.

02:09:46.700 --> 02:09:49.780
I thought it was funny because one person when they voted I was going through the votes

02:09:49.780 --> 02:09:53.380
one person said this is the only time you'll ever see me voting for Britney.

02:09:53.380 --> 02:09:57.940
I thought that was funny.

02:09:57.940 --> 02:10:05.380
Alright, we're going to do some winners for the Midihead CDs, so hurry up, last chance

02:10:05.380 --> 02:10:06.380
to get in.

02:10:06.380 --> 02:10:10.100
Free stuff at orangeontrader.com and also he said he was still taking some stuff on

02:10:10.100 --> 02:10:12.260
his site over at midihead.com too.

02:10:12.260 --> 02:10:19.140
use the email little bubble on his site and there's a little submission form. Very cool.

02:10:19.140 --> 02:10:23.380
And we got, we got that song that he wanted to play earlier. It's actually, I believe

02:10:23.380 --> 02:10:26.700
it's an unreleased track, so I'm pretty excited we're going to be playing an unreleased track

02:10:26.700 --> 02:10:31.100
of his later. So, very excited we're going to be hearing that. In that break, before

02:10:31.100 --> 02:10:35.500
we came back, you heard some music from Para Para Paradise. You know that game. Whatever

02:10:35.500 --> 02:10:39.620
happened to that game? Why did that game have to die? It was one of those games that was

02:10:39.620 --> 02:10:41.620
Cool when it first came out and then it sucked.

02:10:41.620 --> 02:10:43.120
And then it was cool again.

02:10:43.120 --> 02:10:47.120
What was cool about that game is that when we first played it, we had no idea what the hell Parapara was.

02:10:47.120 --> 02:10:52.120
And then we learned, and then it just wasn't as cool as it was.

02:10:52.120 --> 02:10:54.120
I don't know.

02:10:58.120 --> 02:11:00.120
I don't know, it was like one of those things where it was like...

02:11:00.120 --> 02:11:05.120
I think it was cool when people didn't know that you had to do line dances to it, basically.

02:11:05.120 --> 02:11:08.120
And then when you found out you had to do the synchronized dance it was kinda suck.

02:11:08.120 --> 02:11:16.120
But some people really got into it, which is good for them, and then when people just started to have fun with it and not take it so seriously, I think it was cool again.

02:11:16.120 --> 02:11:23.120
So I can go back and listen to that music any time now. There was a period there, though, where it was like, oh, para para. Oh, God.

02:11:23.120 --> 02:11:28.120
Oh, you're upbeat. But no, I understand what you're saying about going back and listening to the music. Yeah.

02:11:28.120 --> 02:11:32.560
Now, usually I don't give away who voted for who in the cage match, but Misty said it was

02:11:32.560 --> 02:11:37.600
okay to say that that was her that voted and said that she didn't, it's the only time she'll

02:11:37.600 --> 02:11:38.600
be voting for Brittany.

02:11:38.600 --> 02:11:40.320
So, she wanted me to pass that along.

02:11:40.320 --> 02:11:42.320
Just for you, Loki.

02:11:42.320 --> 02:11:45.360
You're only encouraging them.

02:11:45.360 --> 02:11:47.440
You're only encouraging them.

02:11:47.440 --> 02:11:53.400
All right, um, so, um, Iguana Girl, I noticed some folks in the chat room right now are

02:11:53.400 --> 02:11:57.800
talking about Disney's rave and some of the non-stops, so it's kind of making me think,

02:11:57.800 --> 02:12:01.320
How did everything go over for Thanksgiving with your guys' non-stop marathon?

02:12:01.320 --> 02:12:03.040
Very, very well.

02:12:03.040 --> 02:12:07.080
We had some large listener counts on both days.

02:12:07.080 --> 02:12:10.680
I really hadn't anticipated on doing both days because I didn't, you know, you know

02:12:10.680 --> 02:12:16.600
how you have, you know, your TBS version of A Christmas Story, how they'll play it for

02:12:16.600 --> 02:12:20.600
like 24 hours straight and just wipe everybody out on it.

02:12:20.600 --> 02:12:21.600
Burnout.

02:12:21.600 --> 02:12:22.600
Yeah.

02:12:22.600 --> 02:12:23.600
You'll shoot your eye out.

02:12:23.600 --> 02:12:24.600
Okay.

02:12:24.600 --> 02:12:25.600
Exactly.

02:12:25.600 --> 02:12:26.600
Exactly.

02:12:26.600 --> 02:12:29.800
for that type of a situation.

02:12:29.800 --> 02:12:32.320
So I went ahead and just did a single day,

02:12:32.320 --> 02:12:34.600
and I did it on Thanksgiving, and then the following day.

02:12:34.600 --> 02:12:39.800
And not quite as many people on the Friday rebroadcast,

02:12:39.800 --> 02:12:42.760
but still very, very respectable.

02:12:42.760 --> 02:12:43.840
A lot of people tuned in.

02:12:43.840 --> 02:12:45.240
It was great.

02:12:45.240 --> 02:12:48.880
And then, of course, we did the Orange Lounge Rewind

02:12:48.880 --> 02:12:49.600
directly after.

02:12:49.600 --> 02:12:52.200
So I'm hoping that we got some of those people to listen in.

02:12:52.200 --> 02:12:54.120
So I got you guys some more exposure, too.

02:12:54.120 --> 02:12:54.480
Cool deal.

02:12:54.480 --> 02:12:55.320
Thank you very much.

02:12:55.320 --> 02:12:56.320
We appreciate the help.

02:12:56.320 --> 02:13:00.320
Anything else exciting coming up on DDR Freak Radio in the near future?

02:13:00.320 --> 02:13:01.320
Not at the present time.

02:13:01.320 --> 02:13:08.520
I'm trying to work with one of the moderators on a side project to see if maybe we can get

02:13:08.520 --> 02:13:13.120
that kind of working, but I don't know when that's going to be coming up.

02:13:13.120 --> 02:13:15.880
I'm sure you guys will hear all about it by the time it's ready.

02:13:15.880 --> 02:13:17.880
Oh, I'm sure we will.

02:13:17.880 --> 02:13:23.400
We should do something for the end of the year, think of something to do, do a countdown

02:13:23.400 --> 02:13:24.400
or something.

02:13:24.400 --> 02:13:25.400
It'll be fun.

02:13:25.400 --> 02:13:27.240
Well, you're going to be at my place anyway.

02:13:27.240 --> 02:13:27.740
That's true.

02:13:27.740 --> 02:13:28.240
That's true.

02:13:28.240 --> 02:13:29.080
So maybe we should.

02:13:29.080 --> 02:13:29.660
Live broadcast, maybe?

02:13:29.660 --> 02:13:30.160
Maybe.

02:13:30.160 --> 02:13:30.840
We'll see.

02:13:30.840 --> 02:13:34.360
And also, I hear that there's a reunion show in the works

02:13:34.360 --> 02:13:35.720
for Understadation Live.

02:13:35.720 --> 02:13:36.520
Yeah.

02:13:36.520 --> 02:13:38.200
Got contacted about that one today.

02:13:38.200 --> 02:13:39.520
That should be interesting.

02:13:39.520 --> 02:13:41.360
For those that don't know, Iguana Girl and I

02:13:41.360 --> 02:13:44.420
used to be co-hosts on a show over on another station,

02:13:44.420 --> 02:13:46.600
Understadation Live, which is still going, by the way.

02:13:46.600 --> 02:13:47.520
Still kicking.

02:13:47.520 --> 02:13:49.100
Over on Live 365.

02:13:49.100 --> 02:13:50.840
Understadationlive.org is the site.

02:13:50.840 --> 02:13:51.680
Go check it out.

02:13:51.680 --> 02:13:53.160
And there's going to be a reunion show coming up

02:13:53.160 --> 02:13:54.200
with Iguana Girl and myself.

02:13:54.200 --> 02:13:55.000
That should be fun.

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:58.000
I believe DarkSakauro is going to be in on it too, because she was a big part of it.

02:13:58.000 --> 02:13:59.000
Yeah, she was a big part of it.

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:01.000
She was the most frequent, no, Islander or her?

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:05.000
One or her, either her or Islander were the most frequent guests at the end of it.

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:10.000
Yeah, so it'll probably be a situation where we'll all just hang out in one room and then

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:15.000
Skype with Travis Donovan over there and see if we can get it all working.

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:16.000
Very cool.

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
See if we can recapture the magic.

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:21.000
Yes, even though it'll kind of be virtual a little bit.

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:22.000
Yeah.

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:26.000
I won't be able to throw any of his figures at me, which will be kind of sad, but you know, we can't do it.

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
And I won't be able to see the white boy dance.

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:29.000
No white boy dance.

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:31.000
We'll have to get him a webcam or something.

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:35.000
No piles and piles of cigarette butts in the ashtray.

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:40.000
I kind of also brought up DDR Freak for a reason, because I was kind of reading, you know,

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:44.000
as a lot of people in the Bomani scene do, I was reading the message boards over there.

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:48.000
And a little bit of spatting going on in the UltraMix 2 thread right now.

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:49.000
A little bit of spatting.

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:50.000
Really? I don't like that.

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:54.120
I know, but nothing that needs, you know, moderation going on or

02:14:54.120 --> 02:14:55.140
anything, but just, you know,

02:14:55.140 --> 02:14:59.120
some people are a little upset with UltraMix 2 saying the timing

02:14:59.120 --> 02:15:02.320
is a big issue and they're saying we need a patch

02:15:02.320 --> 02:15:05.480
for UltraMix 2, dear KCEH,

02:15:05.480 --> 02:15:09.080
patch UltraMix 2, the timing is screwed up and it's

02:15:09.080 --> 02:15:12.600
screwing up my PA. Didn't they do this already before?

02:15:12.600 --> 02:15:17.040
Yeah, isn't this the same

02:15:17.040 --> 02:15:22.000
gripe that they've had. It's interesting, with every new mix that comes out, first bitch,

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:26.200
the steps, second bitch, the timing, third bitch, the song list. Nothing is enough. Nothing

02:15:26.200 --> 02:15:32.820
is enough. Drives me bonkers. You know what, yeah. The nice thing is that nobody was really

02:15:32.820 --> 02:15:36.400
bitching about the song list or the steps this time. So I think the timing. Well, no,

02:15:36.400 --> 02:15:42.080
they have to bitch about something. It would not be, you know, in a consumer-run society,

02:15:42.080 --> 02:15:47.560
me, they have to bitch about something. Yes, exactly. They have to bitch about something.

02:15:47.560 --> 02:15:50.600
No matter what, they have to bitch about something. So I guess, you know, we just have to kind

02:15:50.600 --> 02:15:55.800
of deal with it and kind of ignore the idiots as much as we can.

02:15:55.800 --> 02:16:00.200
And you know, I'm trying to look at both sides of it. You know, I try to take, you know,

02:16:00.200 --> 02:16:04.660
perspective. Okay, I got to see both sides of points of view here. And yeah, the timing

02:16:04.660 --> 02:16:08.640
window is a little different from the arcade. But that's the thing. UltraMix is not the

02:16:08.640 --> 02:16:12.840
arcade and I think that's what a lot of people often forget is that DDR in the

02:16:12.840 --> 02:16:17.340
arcade right now here in the US is six feet under now is there a chance that

02:16:17.340 --> 02:16:22.300
it will rise from the grave and you know kick some ass again in the arcade we

02:16:22.300 --> 02:16:25.860
hope so we really really hope so but for now you know home version is what we got

02:16:25.860 --> 02:16:30.900
and I don't know I just I think these the comparisons to extreme and the other

02:16:30.900 --> 02:16:35.460
Japanese mixes are very interesting when you consider that they're not even

02:16:35.460 --> 02:16:42.660
really supposed to be here. You know what I mean? So, I don't know. I can kind of see

02:16:42.660 --> 02:16:48.140
why there might be a difference too in the fact that you're dealing with completely different

02:16:48.140 --> 02:16:52.100
hardware and you're dealing with an engine that was probably written from the ground

02:16:52.100 --> 02:16:55.940
up. It wasn't really written to emulate the arcade, it was written to be something new

02:16:55.940 --> 02:16:59.140
and I think that's what a lot of people have grown to appreciate about UltraMix too. You

02:16:59.140 --> 02:17:02.620
know what I mean? Where it's kind of like, it's supposed to be something new. So it's

02:17:02.620 --> 02:17:09.960
not going to get it 100%, but I don't know. Well, like I said, it's going to be something.

02:17:09.960 --> 02:17:15.640
It's always going to be something, no matter what. And it's frustrating that people can't

02:17:15.640 --> 02:17:19.800
just appreciate the fact that we are getting these new mixes and that these are things

02:17:19.800 --> 02:17:27.120
that we, how long ago weren't expecting to get any of? I mean, what, less than two years

02:17:27.120 --> 02:17:32.440
ago? We were having to import everything? So, personally, I'm just thankful the fact

02:17:32.440 --> 02:17:37.040
that we have these mixes and the fact that we're getting, that we have, you know, people

02:17:37.040 --> 02:17:39.560
that are interested enough in it to keep us going.

02:17:39.560 --> 02:17:43.080
And I'm not going to say that people who are complaining about it are not thankful because

02:17:43.080 --> 02:17:46.720
chances are they are. They probably love the game. They just, you know, they want to find

02:17:46.720 --> 02:17:48.760
ways... They're not expressing it and that's my concern.

02:17:48.760 --> 02:17:54.960
They want to find ways to make it better. Yeah, but there's ways to go about that. And

02:17:54.960 --> 02:18:03.880
bitching on a message board. Namely, DDR Freak is not the way to go about doing so. Write

02:18:03.880 --> 02:18:08.880
your complaints in a letter. Send it to the appropriate parties. Don't just bitch about

02:18:08.880 --> 02:18:14.720
it on a message board. We don't need it. You're going to get your thread locked. We don't

02:18:14.720 --> 02:18:19.820
need the drama. We got enough drama on our own. Here's the other big drama is that people

02:18:19.820 --> 02:18:25.020
are bitching about song pack 7. The song pack 7 has a bunch of repeats in it. And this

02:18:25.020 --> 02:18:30.100
is, let me tell you guys about what's in song pack 7 right now for Ultramix 2. Let me see

02:18:30.100 --> 02:18:37.900
if I can pull it up here. Cause I have the list up on OrangeLoungeRadio.com. Let's see,

02:18:37.900 --> 02:18:43.940
here it is. Era, End of the Century, La Senorita, Silent Hill, and I Feel the Junk Circuit Mix.

02:18:43.940 --> 02:18:49.560
So you got four songs in there that are old DDR classics. This is what, and a lot of people

02:18:49.560 --> 02:18:54.160
are saying, it ain't worth it, we've played these songs to death. Then don't buy it. And

02:18:54.160 --> 02:18:57.440
a lot of people are expressing they're not going to, which is, you know, fine, but this

02:18:57.440 --> 02:19:00.440
is one of those things where I kind of see it's really, Konami is in a damned if you

02:19:00.440 --> 02:19:04.200
do, damned if you don't situation, because when they don't give us these songs, people

02:19:04.200 --> 02:19:10.920
go, there's not enough of the Japanese mixes in the game. So I'm kind of like, these songs

02:19:10.920 --> 02:19:16.860
here are like staple DDR songs, have never been on the Xbox before, so if you're not

02:19:16.860 --> 02:19:24.580
a PS2 owner, this is a got to do. Just like if you're not an Xbox owner, Festival is probably

02:19:24.580 --> 02:19:27.660
great for you. Whereas a lot of people are hating on it because they're saying, ah, it's

02:19:27.660 --> 02:19:31.660
just a copy of the Xbox version. Well, yeah, but if I were living in Japan and I didn't

02:19:31.660 --> 02:19:35.980
import my games from the US, which I imagine not a lot of people do, I'd probably love

02:19:35.980 --> 02:19:43.100
it. So, I don't know. I think a lot of the people are just kind of taking it with a grain

02:19:43.100 --> 02:19:49.500
us all at this point. I mean, you can't take it personally. You can't, you know, take a

02:19:49.500 --> 02:19:53.460
lot of the complaints to heart. Oh yeah, oh yeah, and I don't think, and I know most people

02:19:53.460 --> 02:19:57.900
at Konami probably don't, and they probably do take each criticism, you know, they probably

02:19:57.900 --> 02:20:02.980
say, okay, you know, maybe we could... Yeah, but after about the 15th billionth time...

02:20:02.980 --> 02:20:07.000
Maybe next, maybe in the next song pack, just two or three of these songs, and then two

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:12.180
or three new songs, and maybe people would be happier, I don't know. But, I don't know.

02:20:12.180 --> 02:20:15.480
I agree, I think they're in a damn if you do damn if you don't situation.

02:20:15.480 --> 02:20:19.480
There's five more song packs to go, boys and girls. I think the best is still yet to come.

02:20:19.480 --> 02:20:23.180
I think one of the better song packs for UltraMix 1 was one of the later ones.

02:20:23.180 --> 02:20:26.780
I want to say it was Song Pack 4 was a really good one.

02:20:26.780 --> 02:20:30.380
Honestly, hold on to your butts.

02:20:30.380 --> 02:20:32.880
It's going to be a fun ride. I think there's going to be better...

02:20:32.880 --> 02:20:39.080
I mean, I will probably buy this song pack anyway just so I can play these songs on Xbox Live

02:20:39.080 --> 02:20:41.880
because I would like to play Era on Xbox Live because I love TAC.

02:20:41.880 --> 02:20:49.880
So, you know, that's enough to seal the deal for me right there, is that we haven't had a lot of these songs in 60 frames a second and, you know, on Xbox Live before, so, why not?

02:20:49.880 --> 02:20:53.880
But, um, if you're not gonna buy it, then fine, I won't play you.

02:20:53.880 --> 02:20:55.880
See if I care.

02:20:55.880 --> 02:20:58.880
Alright, they want us to get to the FUs of the Week.

02:20:58.880 --> 02:21:02.880
Well, who cares? They don't run the radio show!

02:21:02.880 --> 02:21:08.640
That is true, they don't run the radio show but they are our listeners and we want to

02:21:08.640 --> 02:21:13.900
keep them happy so we probably should get to the FUs of the week and so this is the

02:21:13.900 --> 02:21:17.820
part of the show where I would ask Jamie why do we have to do these FUs of the week every

02:21:17.820 --> 02:21:25.020
single week and this is the part where she'd tell me something like because we're angry.

02:21:25.020 --> 02:21:27.620
Because we're not all happy little bunnies.

02:21:27.620 --> 02:21:42.620
Very good.

02:21:42.620 --> 02:21:50.100
On behalf of Jamie, I'll just enter in an F.U. to old people, drivers, stupid people,

02:21:50.100 --> 02:21:57.480
uneducated people, what else does Jamie, what are her names, customers, yeah so.

02:21:57.480 --> 02:22:00.480
I think I probably hit on something in there. I hope. We'll see.

02:22:00.480 --> 02:22:02.480
Hurricanes. That too.

02:22:02.480 --> 02:22:03.480
Life prices. Maybe, you know what?

02:22:03.480 --> 02:22:04.480
Yeah, flight prices.

02:22:04.480 --> 02:22:07.480
She's probably pissed off at jet lag right now, being in Alabama.

02:22:07.480 --> 02:22:08.480
Yeah.

02:22:08.480 --> 02:22:12.480
And I'm sure she's missing us really badly.

02:22:12.480 --> 02:22:16.480
She would give an F.U. to missing Sky and Loki and the Guada Girl and Islander and everybody here.

02:22:17.480 --> 02:22:19.480
Yeah, anyway, let's move on.

02:22:19.480 --> 02:22:26.480
uh...

02:22:26.960 --> 02:22:31.480
fuck you to mario sixty-four ds for being frustrating

02:22:31.480 --> 02:22:34.880
no wonder i didn't have the original game it was too frustrating

02:22:34.880 --> 02:22:39.600
and i want to throw my ds but then before i throw it i realize how expensive it was

02:22:39.600 --> 02:22:43.620
and then don't throw it and continue to play the game and get frustrated even more

02:22:43.620 --> 02:22:46.360
uh... anyway and also

02:22:46.360 --> 02:22:50.960
Fuck you to leaves, there's still tons of them outside, and they're still piled up next to my car.

02:22:50.960 --> 02:22:55.800
Speaking of car, fuck you to my car, cause it's broken in some way and I don't know why.

02:22:55.800 --> 02:23:03.440
And the problem is, is I don't want to take another day off of work just to go down to the dealership and take my car down there so that they can tell me that they don't know what's wrong with it.

02:23:03.440 --> 02:23:04.480
But it's broken.

02:23:04.480 --> 02:23:14.680
Anyways, um, so it still drives, and I don't think it's anything major, like maybe the alignment's off or, you know, the brakes are falling off or something, but other than that, you know, it's fine.

02:23:14.680 --> 02:23:33.680
Um, then, uh, really, I don't know, fuck you for wasting this entire four-day weekend on Final Fantasy XI, because I really didn't do anything, I didn't work on my cabinet, which I should've, and I didn't, you know, clean house or, you know, God knows what else, you know, visit family or something.

02:23:33.680 --> 02:23:52.680
So that sucks. And, um, what else? Oh, just, um, fuck you to work, because, you know, a movie gallery's talking about buying Hollywood video, and that means that there'd be twice as many stupid people that I'd have to talk to every day. So that sucks.

02:23:52.680 --> 02:24:15.000
I don't know why I bought that game and wasted my money, but whatever, okay I'm done.

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:18.600
I escaped the FUs, I was so happy.

02:24:48.600 --> 02:24:55.160
Xbox live because I'm not good at halo 2 f you to the fact that I'm not good at halo 2 makes me sad and

02:24:57.040 --> 02:25:03.120
F you to see gird because he said that he would only be able to battle me on controller tonight on Xbox live

02:25:03.280 --> 02:25:05.680
So we're gonna have to postpone the battle till later anyway

02:25:05.680 --> 02:25:09.140
Cuz we're running out of time and we did the karaoke thing kind of bumped him

02:25:09.140 --> 02:25:12.680
which I'm sure he's pleased about and he'll probably give me an F you about that later, but we'll see and

02:25:12.680 --> 02:25:16.680
Otherwise, I think I'm okay.

02:25:16.680 --> 02:25:17.680
I've had a pretty good weekend.

02:25:17.680 --> 02:25:21.680
I have a lot to be thankful for this Thanksgiving season.

02:25:21.680 --> 02:25:29.880
And oh, I know, F you to whoever decided, my really, really good friend Christopher

02:25:29.880 --> 02:25:35.160
was in the hospital for his appendix to have his appendix taken out, F you to whoever decided

02:25:35.160 --> 02:25:39.000
to play a cruel joke on him and make him go back to have his gallbladder taken out two

02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:40.000
days later.

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:41.000
That sucks.

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:45.000
That sucks. Feel better soon, Christopher. We miss you.

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:49.000
And fuck you, Comedy Central, for not having a new episode drawn together on this week.

02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:54.000
I have to wait fucking another week for a brand new episode, and that pisses me off.

02:25:54.000 --> 02:26:00.000
But thank you for airing two nights in a row, South Park, bigger, longer, and uncut.

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:04.000
And thank you for steering my FUs in a completely different direction.

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:08.000
Let's move on to Iguana Girl. She's got a microphone.

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:11.360
I have a microphone and I'm not afraid to use it.

02:26:11.360 --> 02:26:14.880
Um, big huge F-U to

02:26:14.880 --> 02:26:18.680
my car for having this really weird

02:26:18.680 --> 02:26:24.680
really screwed up, like, brake problem that is inconsistent and only happens when it's

02:26:24.680 --> 02:26:25.720
not raining and

02:26:25.720 --> 02:26:28.960
now I also screw my car because

02:26:28.960 --> 02:26:33.520
it decided to start making a squealing noise whenever I make a hard turn left

02:26:33.520 --> 02:26:36.560
also. So, uh, yeah.

02:26:36.560 --> 02:26:41.720
So this is like multiple issues that the people over at Pep Boys could not figure out and

02:26:41.720 --> 02:26:46.120
now I have to take it to the dealership to have them look at it and tell me that I need

02:26:46.120 --> 02:26:50.760
to spend like $1,000 to get it fixed or something like that.

02:26:50.760 --> 02:26:56.880
And big huge fuck you to the fact that I actually had to work on Friday while all of you guys

02:26:56.880 --> 02:26:59.520
were being lazy asses and had Friday off.

02:26:59.520 --> 02:27:00.520
Yay!

02:27:00.520 --> 02:27:02.520
Yay lazy!

02:27:02.520 --> 02:27:07.520
Yes, being in retail-ish stuff sucks.

02:27:07.520 --> 02:27:16.520
And a big huge F.U. to still having like two weeks off to school and a big huge F.U. to having to study for finals soon.

02:27:16.520 --> 02:27:20.520
And that's about it.

02:27:20.520 --> 02:27:23.520
Alright, let's move on to Islander.

02:27:23.520 --> 02:27:25.520
Oh yeah, I've got a big F.U.

02:27:25.520 --> 02:27:30.520
To the state of California for sending me a jury duty notice.

02:27:30.520 --> 02:27:39.520
I faxed in the stuff that I needed to fax in saying, I cannot take time off from work, yada yada. I never got a response.

02:27:39.520 --> 02:27:41.520
How lovely!

02:27:41.520 --> 02:27:44.520
I'm glad you're not on the Peterson jury.

02:27:44.520 --> 02:27:54.520
Really. So, unfortunately, tomorrow is supposed to be my day off. I have to go down to the courthouse and see if I get picked to serve an injury.

02:27:54.520 --> 02:28:01.520
Oh, no, no, no. In my LJ, a good buddy of mine, a driver walkie, suggested walking into

02:28:01.800 --> 02:28:06.240
the courthouse with a copy of the weekly world news to show how unintelligent I am, and I

02:28:06.240 --> 02:28:13.240
think I'll do that. Fabulous. Second deaf view is actually also to the state of California

02:28:13.320 --> 02:28:20.320
for a late penis on my car insurance, and they want to suspend my license. A big, huge

02:28:20.320 --> 02:28:27.320
Big, huge, long story behind that, but long story short, he's got to do that tomorrow, too.

02:28:27.320 --> 02:28:31.320
And so I've got a really long day with this date, and I really don't like this date at this point.

02:28:31.320 --> 02:28:43.320
But other than that, and also, as I want to go mention, as you do, working on Friday, that sucks, but hey, I need the money.

02:28:43.320 --> 02:28:48.320
And, yep, that's about it.

02:28:48.320 --> 02:28:51.320
All right, let's move on to DDR Angel.

02:28:54.320 --> 02:28:58.320
F you to school, just because I'm starting to hate my instructor more and more.

02:28:58.320 --> 02:29:02.320
But hey, two more weeks left, then I don't have to deal with that to do it ever again.

02:29:04.320 --> 02:29:10.320
F you to Andrew's motherboard being stupid because he can't get on the internet and play F11.

02:29:10.320 --> 02:29:16.320
That was from him to the rest of, I don't know, his buddies I guess.

02:29:16.320 --> 02:29:22.320
Tell him I got my first summon today, and I'm very excited. My summoner is level 20, heh heh heh.

02:29:22.320 --> 02:29:24.320
Addict.

02:29:24.320 --> 02:29:35.320
And, uh, F you to the party in F11 that I was in the other day, because I said I had to go and deal with real life issues, and they said, what's real life?

02:29:35.320 --> 02:29:40.320
And I'm like, oooookay, buh bye, buh bye now, buh bye.

02:29:40.320 --> 02:29:45.320
So just F you to that, because you guys are probably 13 and don't know any better, and don't have a life.

02:29:45.320 --> 02:29:56.320
life. Like the rest of us. I have to get away and real life comes first. So I guess that's it. I'm not really here this week. I'm not writing to DMI.

02:29:56.320 --> 02:30:12.320
That's fine. Actually, let's go over to explicit. Real quick before that, I was just reminded of something because it's like the channel here and right here. Happy birthday this week coming up to DDR Angel and to DDR Archaholic as well.

02:30:12.320 --> 02:30:14.320
Very nice. Yes, that's right.

02:30:14.320 --> 02:30:17.320
Speaking of which, um, who's throwing the party?

02:30:17.320 --> 02:30:19.320
I thought there...

02:30:19.320 --> 02:30:21.320
I thought I saw something on LiveJournal.

02:30:21.320 --> 02:30:24.320
Oh, okay. We'll take... we'll take that discussion offline.

02:30:24.320 --> 02:30:26.320
Meanwhile, explicit!

02:30:26.320 --> 02:30:32.320
Well, I think that's the Thanksgiving, but I'll give an F-you to...

02:30:32.320 --> 02:30:36.320
some asshole, um, hitting... opening the door...

02:30:36.320 --> 02:30:40.320
Grab the mic by the bottom, because the cord's coming out a little bit, and it's... it's making it...

02:30:40.320 --> 02:31:09.320
I'd like to say an f*** you to some a**hole who opened the door to some a**hole who opened the door off of a supermarket, slams my car, leaves a big mark,

02:31:09.320 --> 02:31:14.320
Luckily I have his license plate number so I can go to the department and sue his ass.

02:31:14.320 --> 02:31:19.320
If you're a webcam, I want to give him the middle finger.

02:31:19.320 --> 02:31:21.320
Middle finger.

02:31:21.320 --> 02:31:27.320
F.U. for the turkey for being so dry.

02:31:27.320 --> 02:31:33.320
I think the turkey would say F.U. I'm dead.

02:31:33.320 --> 02:31:35.320
Sorry.

02:31:35.320 --> 02:31:36.980
Ah, that's okay. Sorry about that.

02:31:36.980 --> 02:31:40.440
It has to be for Fry's for having a very fucking long line.

02:31:40.440 --> 02:31:42.160
Oh, yeah.

02:31:42.160 --> 02:31:44.560
I completely forgot about that.

02:31:44.560 --> 02:31:49.600
Yeah, Fry's. So I get there, I go shopping on Black Friday for God knows what reason.

02:31:49.600 --> 02:31:53.800
I just decided, gee, you know, I don't think I've been fucked up the ass enough this week.

02:31:53.800 --> 02:31:55.240
Let's go to Fry's.

02:31:55.240 --> 02:31:59.460
So I go to Fry's, and their line wraps around the whole fucking store.

02:31:59.460 --> 02:32:01.640
It's just forever.

02:32:01.640 --> 02:32:05.640
I like to walk in line, I'm like, I'm all, damn, this line keeps going!

02:32:05.640 --> 02:32:10.640
Keep walking, keep walking, keep walking, see far off in the distance, in the horizon,

02:32:10.640 --> 02:32:15.640
a woman with balloons that says, end of line, I'm like, ah, fuck it.

02:32:15.640 --> 02:32:17.640
So then I had to make a judgment decision.

02:32:17.640 --> 02:32:21.640
So I want to buy the stuff that I couldn't find anywhere else.

02:32:21.640 --> 02:32:22.640
Or rent out the door.

02:32:22.640 --> 02:32:23.640
Or leave.

02:32:23.640 --> 02:32:28.640
Oh wait, if I leave, I have to wait in line to get out of the store, so, yeah, it fucking sucks.

02:32:28.640 --> 02:32:37.640
Anyway, everything what Loki said, except that the register saying, sorry, we closed the line, thank you, goodbye, bye.

02:32:37.640 --> 02:32:43.640
Just what I was about to buy in my $30 512 megabyte RAM.

02:32:43.640 --> 02:32:44.640
I need RAM.

02:32:44.640 --> 02:32:51.640
Now I have to spend 90 bucks or 120 just for it now, because it was a big ass sale at the time.

02:32:51.640 --> 02:32:57.360
one for the damn price. And I feed the Texas Hold'em for giving me some very, very shitty

02:32:57.360 --> 02:33:04.360
cards. Texas Hold'em Poker Set. Texas Hold'em Sacramento Chapter is coming soon from what

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:15.000
I hear. No, it's more like Texas Fuck'em. How the hell can you win with three and two?

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:22.000
2. That's nearly impossible. 3. Close? No. Every time I get a 3 or 2, um, no. Alright.

02:33:23.540 --> 02:33:29.220
Three hour show. Three hour show guys. Wrap it up. Okay, okay, sorry, sorry. And FU4 losing

02:33:29.220 --> 02:33:36.220
my 300 dollar, my very rare European watch, it's now gone, I don't wear it anymore. FU4

02:33:37.800 --> 02:33:42.700
work for miscalculating my hours and money I've actually earned the whole two weeks.

02:33:42.700 --> 02:33:47.700
Damn it, I wanted, I knew, I was like, $100 missing?

02:33:47.700 --> 02:33:50.700
I'm like, what the fuck?

02:33:50.700 --> 02:33:53.700
I'm not, I'm not gonna come around getting slave labor now.

02:33:53.700 --> 02:33:56.700
Shit.

02:33:56.700 --> 02:34:03.700
And after you to the family for making their whole Thanksgiving all anti-American.

02:34:03.700 --> 02:34:07.700
Oh my, how, how, how do you make Thanksgiving anti-American?

02:34:07.700 --> 02:34:09.700
Their American food was turkey.

02:34:09.700 --> 02:34:21.060
Oh, I thought you meant like they were burning flags in the front yard or something.

02:34:21.060 --> 02:34:22.060
Story time.

02:34:22.060 --> 02:34:23.060
Islander's laughing.

02:34:23.060 --> 02:34:24.060
What's up?

02:34:24.060 --> 02:34:25.060
Story time.

02:34:25.060 --> 02:34:26.060
Story time.

02:34:26.060 --> 02:34:27.060
No, you have to tell her.

02:34:27.060 --> 02:34:28.060
Yeah, you tell her.

02:34:28.060 --> 02:34:29.060
I'm stopping the music.

02:34:29.060 --> 02:34:30.060
I can't take Captain Jack anymore.

02:34:30.060 --> 02:34:31.060
I'm sorry.

02:34:31.060 --> 02:34:38.060
We're at Ross's sister's house, and she's talking about how she was talking to this

02:34:38.060 --> 02:34:41.740
friend of hers, co-worker of hers, and she's like, oh, well, I don't know how to make green

02:34:41.740 --> 02:34:47.220
mean casserole. Oh, wait, no, my, my, my little brother's girlfriend is going to be there.

02:34:47.220 --> 02:34:56.540
She's white. She'll know how to make it. Since when is it a requirement of white people to

02:34:56.540 --> 02:35:00.500
know how to make green mean casserole? I'm scared. Does that mean I have to be deported

02:35:00.500 --> 02:35:13.700
because I don't know how to make casserole. I can make hot pockets. Does that count for

02:35:13.700 --> 02:35:25.700
anything? A hot pocket? I eat a lot of pork and I like fried chicken. Can I join the club?

02:35:25.700 --> 02:35:29.700
Anyway, explicit. Finish up your thought. We've got to get to the chat room if yous.

02:35:29.700 --> 02:35:35.700
FU for people complaining about UltraMix 2 and yadda yadda butt stabs and such such such.

02:35:35.700 --> 02:35:42.700
If you don't like those stabs, you can either edit the stabs by yourself, buy a memory card, or buy an Xbox edit.

02:35:42.700 --> 02:35:46.700
I'm assuming that UltraMix 2 has edits to make, right?

02:35:46.700 --> 02:35:47.700
Yes.

02:35:47.700 --> 02:35:51.700
Okay. Or you can go to Stambidia and make your own shit. Plain and simple.

02:35:51.700 --> 02:35:56.200
I'm sure Konami loves hearing that. Alright, alright, we gotta go to the chat room.

02:35:56.200 --> 02:35:57.200
Okay, to be continued.

02:35:57.200 --> 02:36:00.200
Alright, as usual, goody goody. Alright, let's bring the music back.

02:36:03.200 --> 02:36:05.200
This is good chat room F.U. music.

02:36:09.200 --> 02:36:14.200
Alright, Misty says two words, fuck bleeding.

02:36:16.200 --> 02:36:17.200
Panda.

02:36:17.200 --> 02:36:23.200
A-Men! A-Freaking-Men!

02:36:23.200 --> 02:36:28.200
All the guys in the room just had the worst reaction to that. That was amazing.

02:36:28.200 --> 02:36:33.200
Panda just said, F you to Comcast for not working most of the time.

02:36:33.200 --> 02:36:37.200
F you to my mom's friend for what I think is more than just a friend.

02:36:37.200 --> 02:36:40.200
And F you to life.

02:36:40.200 --> 02:36:45.200
Snow Cat says, F you to broken teeth and having to go to the dentist in the morning. Cry.

02:36:45.200 --> 02:36:53.200
MPQ says, Fuck Tekken 5 for being more important to local arcade goers than 2DX.

02:36:53.200 --> 02:36:55.200
Well, it is pretty.

02:36:55.200 --> 02:36:57.200
Pretty, but that's about it.

02:36:57.200 --> 02:37:05.200
Illusion says, F you to my brother being a greedy bastard and not letting me use his Xbox to play Ultra Mix 2 more than a few days in a row.

02:37:05.200 --> 02:37:09.200
Cause you need to fix everyday. Like heroin.

02:37:09.200 --> 02:37:10.200
Like heroin.

02:37:10.200 --> 02:37:12.200
Cap the vein, baby.

02:37:12.200 --> 02:37:18.280
Elle mullet says f you in general to morons who complain about ultramix 2 for the most asinine reasons

02:37:18.540 --> 02:37:22.780
Shut up about the timing windows guys. They don't matter. Just pick a song and have fun

02:37:23.480 --> 02:37:25.120
Yeesh and

02:37:25.120 --> 02:37:27.120
I quote yeesh

02:37:32.120 --> 02:37:38.120
La la la anyway, sorry jaded 2004 says f you to Loki for singing Britney Spears

02:37:38.120 --> 02:37:45.480
Britney Spears. Don't you be giving me the F.U. Blame Rob. They're the ones that said,

02:37:45.480 --> 02:37:53.120
think Britney Spears. I didn't even want to play the game, okay? Love you, Loki. Jaded2004

02:37:53.120 --> 02:37:59.520
also says, F.U. Michigan for having winters too cold. Legend of Zaku says, F.U. to Chartwells,

02:37:59.520 --> 02:38:03.520
the food supplier for my campus, for making me gain 20 pounds. Yeah, because they forced

02:38:03.520 --> 02:38:10.180
you to eat all that food if they forced you freshman 15 fu to my camera in my

02:38:10.180 --> 02:38:15.240
case freshman 30 fu to my campus for giving me a shitty apartment that leaks

02:38:15.240 --> 02:38:19.320
water from the ceilings when it rains heavily now there we go that's valid fu

02:38:19.320 --> 02:38:23.720
to having to give up my PlayStation that so that it can be sent to Peru and fu to

02:38:23.720 --> 02:38:27.840
my shitty stamina contributed to my weight problem for giving me more great

02:38:27.840 --> 02:38:33.140
and not enough perfect I hear you on that one mjb says my f you the week

02:38:33.140 --> 02:38:39.480
goes to my goddamn hair cutress I've never heard a hair cutress who cut my

02:38:39.480 --> 02:38:44.160
hair extremely short after I repeatedly told her to only trim it and not to cut

02:38:44.160 --> 02:38:47.440
it very much you goddamn bitch my friends don't even recognize me anymore

02:38:47.440 --> 02:38:56.640
my hair is so short I hope you collapse you stupid bitch this says f you to

02:38:56.640 --> 02:39:06.780
KONAMI for making Ultramix 2's doubles sucks, suck not sucks. I changed my FU to FU to everyone

02:39:06.780 --> 02:39:10.400
at 8 on the break for being better than me and doing better in the tournament, being

02:39:10.400 --> 02:39:16.120
better in the group. Don't send me a message that says I changed my FU because it doesn't

02:39:16.120 --> 02:39:19.720
work because I read from the top down. So you think before you hit that enter key boys

02:39:19.720 --> 02:39:26.720
and girls. DJ Rama S says, uh, I only, I only got two lines of his, something about having

02:39:28.060 --> 02:39:35.060
the cash to pay for that damn cubic zirconia engagement ring. That's all I got. Flare Onee

02:39:37.040 --> 02:39:44.040
says F you to Konami of Hawaii's obsession with the dancing character Lady. Where is

02:40:14.040 --> 02:40:18.240
feel bad for him, but he might send it in and then we'll figure that out. He says he's

02:40:18.240 --> 02:40:22.840
going to resend, so we'll see. If it's too long though, I'm cutting it short. Alright,

02:40:22.840 --> 02:40:26.240
we're going to go to a break and when we come back, let's give away some Midihead CDs and

02:40:26.240 --> 02:40:30.840
play some Midihead songs as well. I think that sounds like a plan. Yay! Yay! So let's

02:40:30.840 --> 02:40:35.840
play some stuff from, I don't know, what sounds good to you guys. How about some popping?

02:40:35.840 --> 02:40:42.520
Let's do some popping. I want to hear some Goonies. So we're going to do Goonies. We'll

02:40:42.520 --> 02:40:49.520
We'll be back after this break.

02:41:12.520 --> 02:41:14.520
Oh

02:42:12.520 --> 02:42:14.520
Oh

02:42:42.520 --> 02:42:48.520
I can't find out if you're in love

02:42:56.520 --> 02:42:59.520
You don't have to believe in a heart of a doubt

02:42:59.520 --> 02:43:02.520
But it's not what it's supposed to be

02:43:02.520 --> 02:43:07.520
Still, I have to do something about this every morning

02:43:07.520 --> 02:43:10.520
Still, I have to do something about this every morning

02:43:10.520 --> 02:43:13.520
I want to be the only one with you

02:43:13.520 --> 02:43:17.520
I like to be your friend tonight, tonight

02:43:17.520 --> 02:43:20.520
I just want to be your little friend

02:43:20.520 --> 02:43:23.520
Don't go away, there'll be no such thing

02:43:23.520 --> 02:43:28.520
You will never stop me, okay?

02:43:28.520 --> 02:43:31.520
You are a star

02:43:31.520 --> 02:43:34.520
I want you to find me

02:43:34.520 --> 02:43:36.520
I want you to find me

02:43:36.520 --> 02:43:39.520
I want you to find me

02:43:39.520 --> 02:43:43.820
Lookin' in the mirror, hiding underneath the wall

02:43:43.820 --> 02:43:48.520
I wanna know how you feelin' when you see me grow

02:43:48.520 --> 02:43:55.020
You tell me the lies, and the stories that leave me there for now

02:43:55.020 --> 02:44:01.020
Now

02:44:01.020 --> 02:44:28.020
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

02:44:28.020 --> 02:44:38.620

02:46:06.420 --> 02:46:14.180
bit so we'll be contacting you shortly. Alright, let's see, how about some Ask Orange Lounge

02:46:14.180 --> 02:46:17.860
you guys. We've got a little time here. We're going to open up the Skype line as well if

02:46:17.860 --> 02:46:23.580
you guys want to call in over on www.orangelandradio.com. Click on interact with us. But first I have

02:46:23.580 --> 02:46:29.420
to get some FUs of the week in, some that got forgotten there. Seagurd tried to send

02:46:29.420 --> 02:46:34.180
me an FU of the week three times and I don't know why but it's broken. It didn't work right.

02:46:34.180 --> 02:46:40.880
So it's broken. But he was just, he had some choice words for some of the people complaining

02:46:40.880 --> 02:46:45.840
about the game he worked on. So let's just leave it at that.

02:46:45.840 --> 02:46:49.880
I told him I would call him, but he doesn't want to.

02:46:49.880 --> 02:46:54.640
He's shy. But DJ Rama S had another one. He said, a giant F.U. to that stupid bitch that

02:46:54.640 --> 02:46:58.800
whined about the Black Friday sale. Another F.U. to the lady who called me lazy.

02:46:58.800 --> 02:47:02.560
That's why I flipped you off in front of everyone there. And finally, a giant F.U.

02:47:02.560 --> 02:47:05.520
to my former roommate for getting married. By the time I'm done with suing

02:47:05.520 --> 02:47:07.240
your ass for throwing my shit out,

02:47:07.240 --> 02:47:10.680
you won't have the cash to pay for that damn cubic zirconia engagement ring.

02:47:10.680 --> 02:47:14.680
Okay, there we go. There we go. Okay, that was a ring. That makes sense.

02:47:14.680 --> 02:47:18.680
Alright, good deal. Okay, so

02:47:18.680 --> 02:47:22.680
if you guys have a question for Ask Orange Lounge, you can just send that on

02:47:22.680 --> 02:47:26.680
in over private message to Sky right now. Let me just

02:47:26.680 --> 02:47:30.680
type that in chat there. Or can you tell them how to send me a message if you wouldn't mind?

02:47:30.680 --> 02:47:34.680
Okay. In case they don't know. Meanwhile,

02:47:34.680 --> 02:47:38.680
we've got the theme music we've got to do here. And we're also going to

02:47:38.680 --> 02:47:43.040
to take calls over skype for this as well if you guys want to call in our skype line

02:47:43.040 --> 02:47:59.520
there. Type type type. Let's ask orange lounge some stupid question what will we find out

02:47:59.520 --> 02:48:05.800
this week on orange lounge radio. One question I'd like to know is why is loki so bitter

02:48:05.800 --> 02:48:09.240
He threw a fit, and now I'm afraid he's gonna kill me in my sleep.

02:48:09.240 --> 02:48:09.740
YEE!

02:48:15.340 --> 02:48:16.140
Alright.

02:48:17.860 --> 02:48:23.540
First question for Ask Orange Lounge is, uh, actually we don't have any yet, because, uh, there's a delay, so,

02:48:23.540 --> 02:48:27.660
and I forgot to announce this before the previous break, so we don't have any questions over private message just yet.

02:48:27.980 --> 02:48:31.360
So I was gonna open it up if anybody else had any questions for anyone else.

02:48:34.040 --> 02:48:35.280
Anything? Anything?

02:48:35.280 --> 02:48:47.080
Why the F are you, did you just come over here if you're just going to play DS all night?

02:48:47.080 --> 02:48:49.600
I'm fully paying attention, Mr. Mann.

02:48:49.600 --> 02:48:52.480
I'm just teasing, I'm giving you a hard time.

02:48:52.480 --> 02:48:53.480
Where have you been?

02:48:53.480 --> 02:48:54.480
Just busy with school and stuff?

02:48:54.480 --> 02:49:01.480
Busy with school and couldn't get rides and stuff so, you know, stuff happens.

02:49:01.480 --> 02:49:09.480
But I'm here this week and hopefully I can come the next couple weeks and there will be just like old times.

02:49:31.480 --> 02:49:34.960
but I think he said he was on the East Coast. Because your state has it out for you.

02:49:34.960 --> 02:49:39.000
Oh, he says Washington, Washington.

02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:42.320
Isn't Washington where GameWorks is and all those Seattle

02:49:42.320 --> 02:49:46.880
people that have a lot of good stuff up there? Maybe he doesn't live near there, I don't know.

02:49:46.880 --> 02:49:50.360
Well, here's the blanket answer for that question. If you think the

02:49:50.360 --> 02:49:54.120
state of Bemani sucks in your state, buy the home mixes.

02:49:54.120 --> 02:49:56.940
Okay, there's one option. You know, they put those out for a reason so you can play in the

02:49:56.940 --> 02:49:57.680
comfort of your own

02:49:57.680 --> 02:50:01.800
own home. If you still don't like it, get some of your friends together, professionally

02:50:01.800 --> 02:50:02.560
approach

02:50:02.560 --> 02:50:06.560
the management at your local arcade and say, hey, we've got an idea for a game that

02:50:06.560 --> 02:50:08.240
would bring you guys money

02:50:08.240 --> 02:50:11.480
and emphasize money and

02:50:11.480 --> 02:50:14.760
visiting frequently. So if you don't like the situation

02:50:14.760 --> 02:50:18.320
you can take control in your own hands and do something about it.

02:50:18.320 --> 02:50:22.120
Just a thought for you guys.

02:50:22.120 --> 02:50:27.760
Let's see, Flaronay says, are you guys going to be on Xbox Live tonight?

02:50:27.760 --> 02:50:33.120
I may sneak on after, right after the show, because you guys still need to see Ultramix 2, right?

02:50:33.120 --> 02:50:39.120
Yeah. Okay, we're going to put it, we'll sneak on there after the show a little bit, maybe.

02:50:39.120 --> 02:50:41.320
So you might see us on there for a little bit, Flaronay, look for us.

02:50:41.320 --> 02:50:44.720
He knows the secret way to find us on Xbox Live.

02:50:44.720 --> 02:50:47.920
Dark Knight says, what are your guys' Christmas wishes this year?

02:50:47.920 --> 02:50:51.320
Anybody care to answer a Christmas wish?

02:50:51.320 --> 02:50:54.520
I wish for world peace.

02:50:54.520 --> 02:50:55.680
I need no clothes.

02:50:55.680 --> 02:50:56.680
I want to get laid.

02:50:56.680 --> 02:50:57.680
Just kidding.

02:50:57.680 --> 02:51:05.560
No, uh, my Christmas wish is just, um, I would like to just have enough time to hang out

02:51:05.560 --> 02:51:06.560
with all my friends.

02:51:06.560 --> 02:51:07.560
I want a lot of parties.

02:51:07.560 --> 02:51:09.080
I want a lot of holiday parties.

02:51:09.080 --> 02:51:10.080
That's my Christmas wish.

02:51:10.080 --> 02:51:11.080
I want holiday parties.

02:51:11.080 --> 02:51:14.000
And that can be Christmas, New Year's, and year round, really.

02:51:14.000 --> 02:51:15.720
Just throw parties all year round.

02:51:15.720 --> 02:51:16.720
That's great.

02:51:16.720 --> 02:51:18.920
Angel, did you have something you want to add to that, your Christmas wish?

02:51:18.920 --> 02:51:19.920
I got mine.

02:51:19.920 --> 02:51:21.920
Oh, what's that?

02:51:21.920 --> 02:51:25.920
Uh, DS, but, uh, I already got it, and...

02:51:25.920 --> 02:51:29.920
Well, I don't really know what I want besides, uh,

02:51:29.920 --> 02:51:33.920
the Karaoke Revolution 2 and 3, which I haven't gotten yet,

02:51:33.920 --> 02:51:35.920
and, uh, Officer Mix 2.

02:51:35.920 --> 02:51:39.920
Uh, the rest has to come later, because it's more expensive,

02:51:39.920 --> 02:51:42.920
like, uh, Ace Style and, uh, 10.

02:51:42.920 --> 02:51:46.920
I know. Yeah, I do really want Ace Style and Poppin' 10.

02:51:46.920 --> 02:51:48.920
It's just gonna be a little while there, so...

02:51:48.920 --> 02:51:52.340
you do I need anybody else want to share anything they want for Christmas this

02:51:52.340 --> 02:52:00.620

02:52:15.140 --> 02:52:22.500
Christmas wish all right we have a question from illusion this is great

02:52:22.500 --> 02:52:28.320
listen to this one how do you deal with secret sweet ass ever anytime he comes

02:52:28.320 --> 02:52:36.720
on is it hard keeping your hands off of it well um you know what secrets just a

02:52:36.720 --> 02:52:49.240
friend. You know he's just a friend. Oh baby you got what I need. Would you want to grab

02:52:49.240 --> 02:52:57.140
your brother's sweet ass? No. You may if you live in Alabama. I don't have these sweet

02:52:57.140 --> 02:53:02.120
ass feelings towards Sigurd. Do you have sweet ass Sigurd feelings going on girl? I don't.

02:53:02.120 --> 02:53:06.700
I'm sorry. I know that's gonna, you know, be heartbreaking for him, but I don't.

02:53:06.700 --> 02:53:08.920
Yeah. Islander? Never have.

02:53:08.920 --> 02:53:13.320
Loki, how do you resist secret sweet ass? Quite easily, I'm straight.

02:53:13.320 --> 02:53:18.800
Alright, moving on.

02:53:18.800 --> 02:53:24.000
DJ Rama S says, do you guys want a holiday card for me?

02:53:24.000 --> 02:53:28.280
Certainly, of course we want a holiday. We'll put it up on our wall.

02:53:28.280 --> 02:53:34.280
We have a little wall here. Well, we can't put it with the autographs, but maybe we'll start another wall for holiday wishes.

02:53:34.280 --> 02:53:39.280
But then again, I don't want to give out my address, so we'll see. Maybe we can do something. We'll see.

02:53:39.280 --> 02:53:42.280
Like a P.O. Box, maybe.

02:53:42.280 --> 02:53:48.280
That's funny. The In My Eyes remix of the long one is actually Midi Head's super long mix.

02:53:48.280 --> 02:53:53.280
Yeah, on the V-Rare, it says super long on the V-Rare.

02:53:53.280 --> 02:53:56.280
Hello, where were you two weeks ago?

02:53:56.280 --> 02:53:59.860
Legend of Zaku says, you're on that DDR diet, right?

02:53:59.860 --> 02:54:02.500
I need help planning a regimen for dropping 20 pounds,

02:54:02.500 --> 02:54:05.580
AKA what songs and or oni choruses must I do to really

02:54:05.580 --> 02:54:07.300
start shedding weight?

02:54:07.300 --> 02:54:08.720
OK, here's my honest answer to the question.

02:54:08.720 --> 02:54:11.500
There's really no set songs or choruses to do.

02:54:11.500 --> 02:54:13.620
There's no super weight loss plan.

02:54:13.620 --> 02:54:15.820
My suggestion is if you're going to play non-stops, play

02:54:15.820 --> 02:54:16.660
the long ones.

02:54:16.660 --> 02:54:19.180
Play 7 to 10, because the more you take breaks in between

02:54:19.180 --> 02:54:21.820
songs, the less your cardio's going to go.

02:54:21.820 --> 02:54:26.500
The main thing is cardio. You want to focus on doing at least a good 20 minutes of non-stop

02:54:26.500 --> 02:54:32.980
cardio. Even if that means doing something as simple as just a basic endless. Even then

02:54:32.980 --> 02:54:42.200
you're going to be burning enough calories and getting rid of some of that excess. Try

02:54:42.200 --> 02:54:47.700
to keep the breaks as small as possible. Don't do too much. Don't overdo it.

02:54:47.700 --> 02:54:53.380
I am on the DDR diet and to an extent I'm all for the fact that you know DDR can help

02:54:53.380 --> 02:54:59.480
you lose weight but honestly you've got to do it I think really to make it really successful

02:54:59.480 --> 02:55:04.280
you got to do it with other stuff stop drinking soda if you're drinking soda that was my honestly

02:55:04.280 --> 02:55:09.120
that was really how I lost a lot of my weight stop drinking soda drink a lot of water sit-ups

02:55:09.120 --> 02:55:14.840
push-ups that kind of stuff can help you out too that would be my suggestion if you really

02:55:14.840 --> 02:55:19.400
want more exercise because DDR it works, it gives you a really good workout but you know

02:55:19.400 --> 02:55:22.320
I think you can enhance it, you can make it better by doing other little things too.

02:55:22.320 --> 02:55:28.080
Buy like a little set of those mini five pound hand weights or something like that and workout

02:55:28.080 --> 02:55:29.080
with those.

02:55:29.080 --> 02:55:30.080
Alright.

02:55:30.080 --> 02:55:37.160
If you have a max 2 I'll play a pop 8.

02:55:37.160 --> 02:55:42.020
Dojo Max says when will DDR max 3 come out?

02:55:42.020 --> 02:55:47.060
I heard Naoki is producing it in a secret basement, is this true?

02:55:47.060 --> 02:55:50.540
Chances are no, that's not true. We would probably...

02:55:50.540 --> 02:55:56.460
Don't believe anything unless we report it. No. Unless Konami's official site says something,

02:55:56.460 --> 02:56:00.780
there's really nothing you can do. It's all speculation.

02:56:00.780 --> 02:56:04.740
And I do think if a new DDR at this point comes out, it's not going to be called Max 3.

02:56:04.740 --> 02:56:06.140
It will be called something else.

02:56:06.140 --> 02:56:10.020
Because Max 3 was extreme. I don't know if you missed DDR extreme, but...

02:56:10.020 --> 02:56:15.780
I think if they do do a new DDR, honestly, here's my suggestion, and Konami, if you're

02:56:15.780 --> 02:56:18.300
listening, feel free to take this.

02:56:18.300 --> 02:56:21.740
If you're going to do a new DDR, you're going to do a new hardware thing, right, and you're

02:56:21.740 --> 02:56:25.060
probably going to spice it up a little bit, make it a little more like 2DX, like bigger,

02:56:25.060 --> 02:56:26.800
badder, better thing, right?

02:56:26.800 --> 02:56:28.260
Here's my suggestion.

02:56:28.260 --> 02:56:35.380
Dance Dance Revolution 2.

02:56:35.380 --> 02:56:36.380
It's as simple as that.

02:56:36.380 --> 02:56:39.140
Wow, interesting name.

02:56:39.140 --> 02:56:44.300
Dance Dance Revolution 2. Question on behalf of Dark Child through DD

02:56:44.300 --> 02:56:47.360
Archaholic and this will be the last question for tonight you guys. If Dark

02:56:47.360 --> 02:56:54.960
Child was gay would Sky sleep with him? No. Alright that's gonna do it for Ask

02:56:54.960 --> 02:56:59.420
Orange Lounge tonight. Thank you guys very much for your questions tonight and

02:56:59.420 --> 02:57:03.980
participating. Now we're gonna go around and get everybody's final thought but

02:57:03.980 --> 02:57:07.080
not before we get in a plug for the rest of the week's programming. Monday night

02:57:07.080 --> 02:57:11.680
Tune in to Diversion, the Orange Lounge Radio remix show, right here on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:57:11.680 --> 02:57:16.520
All your favorite Bamani remixes, official fan-made ones, and yes, remixes done in acid

02:57:16.520 --> 02:57:17.520
are okay.

02:57:17.520 --> 02:57:18.520
Yay!

02:57:18.520 --> 02:57:19.520
Tuesday night, Dark Sakura.

02:57:19.520 --> 02:57:22.040
I do believe she's back this Tuesday and she's gonna be doing...

02:57:22.040 --> 02:57:24.640
She's not gonna be back until way late though.

02:57:24.640 --> 02:57:28.740
So it'll be a re-run of Pump Up the Volume, ready to go.

02:57:28.740 --> 02:57:31.700
So likely we're gonna get a re-run of Pump Up the Volume, but it's a good show and you

02:57:31.700 --> 02:57:35.560
should tune in, you know, and check out what it's all about if you haven't listened before,

02:57:35.560 --> 02:57:40.900
because it'll be new to you. So Tuesday nights, about 730, pump up volume. Thursday nights,

02:57:40.900 --> 02:57:44.180
I'm sorry, Wednesday nights are the classic episodes of Orange Lawns Radio. Thursday nights,

02:57:44.180 --> 02:57:48.140
myself, Rice Princess and Lanky Style, we're back from our Thanksgiving holiday this week

02:57:48.140 --> 02:57:52.700
with Outside the Box, all that other video gaming chat that doesn't quite fit into the

02:57:52.700 --> 02:57:58.580
Bomani spectrum. And then Friday night over on The Freak, or DDR Freak Radio, Orange Lawns

02:57:58.580 --> 02:58:03.900
Radio Rewind. Hear the same shit over again, but it's just as good the second time, you

02:58:03.900 --> 02:58:05.900
Especially when you missed some of it.

02:58:05.900 --> 02:58:07.900
That spilling tastes great.

02:58:07.900 --> 02:58:09.900
Alright, so that's it for the programming.

02:58:09.900 --> 02:58:12.900
And now, we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought.

02:58:12.900 --> 02:58:15.900
We'll start with Islander, because he has a microphone over there.

02:58:15.900 --> 02:58:18.900
Ah, final thought.

02:58:18.900 --> 02:58:21.900
Quit your bitching and just accept it.

02:58:21.900 --> 02:58:22.900
Thank you.

02:58:22.900 --> 02:58:24.900
Very stern.

02:58:24.900 --> 02:58:27.900
Angel, your final thought.

02:58:27.900 --> 02:58:29.900
Mario sucks!

02:58:29.900 --> 02:58:31.900
No, just kidding.

02:58:31.900 --> 02:58:37.900
I really want to know what's wrong with my car, please.

02:58:37.900 --> 02:58:40.900
Exquisite.

02:58:40.900 --> 02:58:50.900
Stupid drivers must get the actual driver's how to drive. God motherfucking damn it.

02:58:50.900 --> 02:58:52.900
Loki, your final thought?

02:59:20.900 --> 02:59:25.900
After the credits, because we're going to be playing that other Midihead song, so if you liked that last one, you've got to check out this other new one.

02:59:25.900 --> 02:59:30.900
It's an unreleased track, I believe. It's called Deeper and Deeper. That's what we're going to be hearing after the show.

02:59:30.900 --> 02:59:39.900
I'd like to mention that that track is inside the little special members area if you purchased an album.

02:59:39.900 --> 02:59:41.900
Well, hell, there you go.

02:59:41.900 --> 02:59:45.900
Alright, so have a great night, everybody. Thank you very much for listening.

02:59:45.900 --> 02:59:50.100
listening. The Fortune Cookie message is an oldie but goodie tonight because I didn't

02:59:50.100 --> 02:59:53.300
get a new one from Dark Sakura, unfortunately. But this is a good one, so you guys will enjoy

02:59:53.300 --> 02:59:59.780
tonight's Fortune Cookie message. The final word of the show goes to... Islander. One

02:59:59.780 --> 03:00:10.340
word. Sum it all up. Ergasmic. That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio

03:00:10.340 --> 03:00:17.580
Live. Orange Lounge Radio Live is an Orange Lounge Radio production. For more information

03:00:28.060 --> 03:00:31.060
of the day.

03:00:31.060 --> 03:00:39.060
Hey folks, this was CJ Radio presenting you Captain Jack's Greatest Summer Heads.

03:00:39.060 --> 03:00:46.060
Keep the spirit, the sun is shining wherever you are, and don't forget, copy kills music.

03:00:46.060 --> 03:00:49.060
So, don't copy, buy our records.

03:00:49.060 --> 03:00:52.060
Bye-bye, the party never ends.

03:00:52.060 --> 03:00:59.620
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
