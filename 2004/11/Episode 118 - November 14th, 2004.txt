Oh, God.

Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that in this episode.
Well, isn't that special?
Orange Lounge Radio Live is a fully interactive program via our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com And now, here are your hosts for Orange Lounge Radio Live, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
We are live!
And this is episode number 118 for this podcast.
I hate my allergies and want them to die.
Fair enough.
Also joining us tonight, the other awesome co-hosts we have here are Techmaster Loki, I'm Rowling.
Yes, if you want to know why our webcam isn't up yet and why we don't have the DarkSakura in our chatroom yet over at OrangeHunter.com, that's because we're having an emergency Katamari Damacy marathon.
Maybe Jamie will tell us about why we have to do that in a little bit.
But I do want to introduce our other guests for tonight.
We have a very special guest joining us for the second week in a row.
A lovely surprise.
He's in town tonight.
Say hello to Floatwalk.
Personal record for me.
That's right, two in a row.
If you made it next week, you'd have tic-tac-toe.
Wow, and three is a magic number.
It sure is.
Alright, so, Jamie, really fast before we go to the opening break here.
Why is Loki having to play Katamari Damacy right now?
It's so big!
Oh, um, because I can only get up to, as any, I've only done the level twice, 256 meters on the Make the Moon level.
And he's got this up to 744.
This is awesome.
Wow.
It's so big.
Yeah, so that's the only time Lokis are going to hear that in his life.
That's right.
All right, we're going to wrap up Katamari Dimash and put on the webcam and all that stuff.
So visit OrangeLoungeRadio.com, our website, for all the webcam details and stuff.
Tonight we have a lot of special stuff for you during the music break.
The Ultramix 2 website went up earlier this week.
We're going to be talking about that in a little while, but because of that...
We got a lot of spoiled songs.
Yay, spoilers, my favorite.
Wow, just take the fun away from us Vivids while we still have them.
You know what, you guys quit like three weeks ago, so as far as I'm concerned, you're done.
We're done with you.
No, I'm kidding.
I see how it is.
No, we're kidding.
We definitely want to get the gossip from you later.
But as long as we have the songs, because we have a whole lot of songs, we just, we went out there on the internet and everywhere we looked, we lifted up tables and dusted under them and we looked everywhere for as many of these songs as we could find for you guys to play.
So we're going to play them for you tonight.
We couldn't find everything, but we found a lot.
So we're going to play them for you, starting with this.
It's a brand new licensed song from Ultramix 2.
The artist is Lava, kind of like the soap, but with an extra A. And the song is called Wherever You Are.
And actually, this is not the first time we've played this on Orange Lounge Radio.
Really?
Yeah, I'm going to talk about why when we come back after this.
So enjoy this.
This is Lava with Wherever You Are from Ultramix 2.
Thank you for watching!
How I miss you so much I feel love in your eyes And I feel love when I'm with you I feel love in your eyes Wherever you may be
Gaming Radio.
So uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.
Orange Lounge Radio.
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
Turn off that Katamari game already.
That's so last month.
Get into now!
No, I know, I'm kidding.
But you... Now, apparently, Floatwalk was impressed because Loki knew about a hidden game during the credits.
Tell us about what's going on there.
Because I, unfortunately, did not really get into Katamari.
I got to, like, the second stage, and then suddenly got sucked into the other game.
Well, apparently, at the end, like, you see the credits roll, and you have a song, and you see, like, you know, your little guy running around with the ball.
You can actually move the analog sticks around.
You can pick up countries.
and so like you see like a list of countries like you know you see I picked up Korea picked up you know Vietnam all stuff I'm sitting here thinking wow I haven't seen so many like of those country names since like Animaniacs when uh what was it Yakko did United States, Canada, Mexico, Panama, Haiti, Jamaica, Peru you know I just wanted you to sing that song on air because that made me giggle during the break all right uh well good so we we we made the moon for Jamie good
Now she can't say that we don't do things for her on this show because we make the moon for her.
We gave her the moon, the stars, and the sky.
We swear.
That's right.
Failed.
Boo!
I had to go there.
If that was a thread, I would lock it.
Alright.
Um...
Jamie's in the potty right now, so we can't do how was your week, how was your day.
Oh, she's on her way out, but I'll take a minute to do some announcements.
By the way, folks, this is very interesting.
Here in the Orange Lounge Radio studio, the bathroom door, the lock is broken.
I was wondering what the hell was up with that.
At any time, somebody could barge in there while you're trying to tinkle, so please be careful.
Here's the rule.
If the light is on and the fan is running, don't come a-knockin'.
Alright.
I couldn't come up with a rhyme for that, sorry.
I think your mic ain't on there.
Try it again.
If the fan is running, you better start running because you never know what they're doing in there.
Exactly.
Something like that.
Anyway.
Oh yeah, relevant announcements.
Did you hear, maybe we've mentioned it a couple times, that we're going to be doing a really big giveaway here on Orange Lounge Radio.
And I'm not talking about, you know, no small time little, you know, yada yada giveaway.
We're talking really big news here.
We are giving away, in conjunction with DDRspot.com, that's kind of why Floatwalk's here tonight, because he's a big part of the DDRspot community, Orange Launch Radio, in conjunction with DDRspot.com, is giving away signed Akira Yamoka CDs.
Very cool.
We're going to be giving away two of them, so the contest is going to go for two weeks.
Now, here's the thing, though.
We changed the rules a little bit from what we talked about last week.
Because we can.
Yeah, because we can't, basically, is what it boils down to.
Now, and I know you love it when you hear that we changed the rules, but no, actually we did it to make the contest easier for you.
So here's the deal.
Forget what I said previously about how it's going to work.
How it's going to work now is that you know we have spin-off shows here on Orange Lounge Radio every Monday night, Diversion, the Orange Lounge Radio remix show, every Tuesday night, Pump Up the Volume with DarkSakura, and every Thursday night, Outside the Box with yours truly.
All of which are on at 7, although Pump Up the Volume technically starts at 7.30.
You've got to listen to those spin-off shows, and during the show at any time, we're going to ask a trivia question about Akira Yamaoka,
or it could be about something Akira Yamaoka was involved with, such as Silent Hill series would be a great one.
We're going to ask a trivia question.
If you know the answer to the trivia question, send an email to akira at orangeloungeradio.com and you will be entered into the contest.
That's the change.
You don't have to listen all three nights to be entered.
But what the change does allow us to do is that if you do listen all three nights and you send us three emails with the three different answers, you'll be entered in the contest three times.
So you have three times the chance of somebody else if you listen all week long.
But if you just, you know what, if you have a busy schedule and you can only listen one night, you can still get one entry into the contest.
So the contest starts tomorrow.
On the 15th, and it's going to run through the 20... It looks like the last entry chance will be on the 25th, Thanksgiving.
How appropriate.
Thanksgiving Day will be your last chance to enter, so look for that.
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
I'm going to tell you, I'm going to tell you, as soon as we finish this segment here with How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day, some folks already know.
Some folks have already figured it out, but we will tell you officially what's going on in a minute.
As I said, we've got to start off every week's show with a little bit of How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day, and of course, the lovely Dark Sakura starting us off, as always.
My week was insanely busy.
Just school, everything.
And then today, my allergies have been killing me all day.
It's been...
I'm trying to not get sick and everyone's getting sick around me, but I'm hoping that by running away to Alabama in another week, I'll be escaping the whole thing.
But apart from that, I really didn't do a whole bunch of anything.
Dot, dot, dot.
Okay.
As really, it's really been nothing but school and hanging out and just the same old crap I normally do.
So, now as for Rob's week, first he went on an expedition to Alaska where the Eskimos kidnapped him and made him their king.
Stop telling lies while I'm out of the room.
Although that did happen, actually.
It was three weeks ago, not last week.
Oh, my bad.
Yeah, your bad.
Oh, anyway.
Sorry.
I had to check on my laundry.
Because when Jamie comes over, she likes to not only do orange laundry.
This is how we pay Jamie for doing the show.
Since we don't have money to exactly give out to people, we pay in laundry.
In clean laundry.
That way I don't have to use our...
Hey, that's worth a lot of quarters for the arcade.
Alright.
And I'll pay you back in sinus goo.
Hooray.
Just what I always wanted.
Alright, so that's it?
My week was boring.
What's up with that?
The past two weeks you've been boring.
The past two weeks.
Well, I train people too.
That's my job.
Yeah, but I'm going to be going to Alabama though next week.
You're not going to be here for next week's show?
Well, I will be here Sunday, but that's Wednesday, the 24th.
I'm leaving.
Leaving on a plane.
Leaving on a jet plane.
Moving on.
Actually, next Sunday is going to be an interesting show because I have to get up at 4 in the morning on that Monday.
I'm going to L.A.
for a day for work, so I didn't even think I'd be able to do this show, but it does look like I will be able to do this show.
Not that you care.
Anyway, Flo Walks, since you have a microphone, why don't you let us know how was your week, how was your day?
Um, the week was different, because, um, as I just started, uh, my new job over at Princeton Review up in, uh, the city, and, uh, it's just really weird just seeing, like, just all the stuff that goes on, because mostly I do, like, um, I do a lot of, like, online-type QAs, so all the college applications they do online, I'm working on all that kind of stuff.
It's kind of funny, well, also kind of depressing in the sense that I'm sitting here thinking, I used to do this stuff for AltaVista about,
4 years ago and I got paid about 3 times as much to do the same exact work I'm doing now and you'd always think it would be like kind of opposite considering you know like inflation all kind of stuff like yeah now I'd be making more since you know I've done it been there done that and it's just like regression and it's kind of a trippy feeling really um other than that it's just mostly been yeah just busy type of work week and then it's all on the personal side
I've actually been up in SACTO this week and I'm just, you know, visiting friends, you know, that kind of stuff.
It's kind of getting reacquainted with, uh, more games and all that jazz.
Been, like, playing Smackdown vs. Raw ad nauseum now.
And, uh, let's see.
Gosh, it's, um...
Yeah, it's been a pretty tame week, all things considered.
Well, now this coming week, we've got the whole Ultramix 2 thing coming out and stuff, so I'm sort of, you know, kind of thinking here, well, what can I officially disclaim, you know, as of right now?
Yeah, it's like, what parts of the NDA can I blab about now?
But it's got to be a little bit of a relief now that most of the song list is out there, that you can kind of go...
Oh, and for the record, I did not leave Konami in the first place.
As I see in the chat room, I was actually laid off, which is actually... It's a little something that I'll probably get into later, because it's probably an interesting note about what goes on, you know, the inner workings of a crazy lab like that.
There's been lots of shake-ups in the video game world lately.
We'll get into that.
We'll get into one of the other ones later.
Yeah, yeah, funny enough.
But let's see, and then, you know, like I said, today, now it's just like...
Since I was up in Sacto, I figured, what the heck, you know, I'll just come on to Orange Lounge and show them a good time or something.
And it's really weird, because normally I have Shark Skrull with me, and she's not here, and it's kind of bummed.
Maybe she's listening.
Perhaps.
But she was up here one time when I wasn't, so I think we're catching up.
That was a long time ago.
It was years ago.
But yes, she was here one time when you weren't.
I remember that.
Okay.
But once I laid off, I see on the...
Well, you knew it was going to come up.
Well, yeah.
Well, I mean, it's really not a surprise for anyone who hasn't been familiar with the game industry or just QA in general.
Usually you're commissioned as, you know, working on a single project or just projects when they're available.
The way the video game industry works is usually they'll get their games around springtime or like early summer.
I mean, usually they start doing QA for demos for like E3, you know, just to make sure things are stable enough.
And then...
Once that goes around, then obviously you go into development, and of course you need testers.
And then you test throughout the summer through like early fall.
Then once all the products get pushed out, I mean... Because everything, the big time for the gaming season is Christmas, so basically the games are being tested a couple months before then, right?
Right.
But you don't see a lot of big games coming out in January, February, unless you're Nintendo this year.
I don't... Nintendo has huge games coming out, but... But, um... Well, yeah, we got, okay, a few here and there, but even Suikoden IV was supposed to be out Christmas, wasn't it?
Yeah, it was.
It was supposed to be part of that big Konami extravaganza blowout thingamabob, but, um... Sunday, Sunday, Sunday!
Yeah.
But once the, uh, around November rolls around, it's like, well, they don't have any projects left.
I mean, the only thing you really do, like,
At Konami, for example, once all that's done, you'll probably either be doing a few text checks or you're doing customer service.
What really I found curious was they downsized customer service.
And you would think, around this time when all their new tiles are coming out, you need people to support people like, well, this game is crashing on my PC.
And that's like 90% of any problems people have, like issues with Konami is,
PC GAMES
I want to address a couple of points that are in our chat room, www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on chat.
Toshin says, if you aren't a part of X company, isn't the NDA dissolved?
Oh no, that's hardly the case.
I mean, you can essentially say, yeah, I worked on it.
You can say something specific.
But NDA is kind of like, they use that for stuff like, well, obviously I couldn't tell you what kind of software they used for, you know,
I don't have a look.
I happen to be doing my homework here.
Jamie just pulled out her big business law textbook.
It's just going to thumb through it, see what it says.
It's essentially, I mean, to protect more or less like intellectual property of Konami.
I would compare it to, let's say, the folks that go on that game show Survivor, right?
You've got 16 people that go on the show.
The damn thing's taped months in advance.
They already know who won the damn thing, or at least they know who the two finalists are, but the contestants are still all under that gag order where they can't talk about it until it airs on TV or else they get sued for $11 billion.
Yeah, yeah, that's essentially what it all boils down to.
I mean, I have no problem adhering to that or any of that kind of stuff.
Yeah, you don't want to get sued for $11 billion.
Yeah, and you don't want to lose your job just because, you know, you want to sound cool and like, oh yeah, I got the inside scoop.
I mean, it's a good thing that at least I'm pretty close with Jason, you know, it's because most of the stuff we do is DDR related, so anytime I ever even like
GetTempted to say anything, I'd talk to him first and be like, you know, is this cool, is this cool?
I knew that Delirium was going to be on Ultramix 2 before any of you.
My internet penis is huge!
I have it if you're ready, by the way.
Oh, okay, yes.
Yeah, I mean, it's, yeah, there, I mean, you'd be surprised.
There are actually people who come to work for, you know, Konami at the time, and, like, one day they'll say, yeah, Rumble Roses was in office, and, you know, stuff like that, and, like, the guy will just get canned, like, in one hour.
So...
They're pretty serious about stuff like that, but I mean, overall, as long as you know when to say when, it's not a bad thing.
Interesting.
Jamie, yes, your textbook.
The textbook definition.
NDAs have been around for a long time and traditionally have been used among lawyers, investment bankers, and others involved in trade takeovers and other large corporate deals.
NDAs swear the signatory to secrecy about confidential ideas, trade secrets, and other non-public information revealed by the party proffering the NDA.
So it's an actual contract and it's binding despite employment and anything else.
There you have it.
So in other words, you ain't talking!
You ain't gonna make me talk!
I mean, basically, if you said, yeah, X-Song is gonna be in DDR, you could be sued for breach of contract.
Oh yeah, but see, that's why I let everyone else handle all that.
I mean, it's really gone to the point... Although at the same time, is it really that big a deal?
Yes, and... I guess so, with the licenses, it could be, but especially when some licenses get cut right before the game comes out, I mean, that could be a big deal.
Oh yeah, I mean, you know, if not for people...
basically going through and like hacking party collection you would have you know you wouldn't have known about the songs that never made it into DDR for you know whatever reason or all that kind of stuff and funny enough it's usually licenses first that you know are often announced because obviously you need something to sell the game and you know you want to give the public something that's a familiar uh title that they can relate to like they say oh wow you know such and such artist yeah they're popular wow they got them in DDR that must be you know
DarkSakura
All right, well, fair enough.
That's what you got to do.
All right, moving on.
We were doing How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day before we got on that little tangent, but that was a good tangent.
I actually forgot to mention something that happened during my week.
Okay.
I sprained my wrist, and they put me in a cast on Thursday, and I cut it off.
You took the law into your own hands?
You took the law of medicine into your own hands?
Yeah, and I'm not wearing my brace either because it sucks.
Okay, I'm done.
Do you have any pictures of you and the cast, though?
I do, I have one online, but since I can't access the chatroom, I can't post it.
I know, for some reason, I don't know why, but other side IRC, the network only lets two simultaneous connections from our house.
Actually, go to www.darksakura.com slash images slash fuckcast.jpg Okay, I will put that in and then post it in the chatroom if somebody doesn't beat me to it.
In the meantime, Loki!
How was your week?
How was your day?
My week was, you know, it was okay.
It was fine.
Until I got this fucking headache today!
And then it went really shitty!
I don't understand it.
I get headaches on Sundays.
Why?
It's always on Sundays.
It's always a sinus pressure headache.
I think I'm allergic to something in this house.
It's gotta be.
But, yeah, I have a bad headache.
and it's only on Sundays, so it must be Jamie.
It was before she came over.
Yeah, I'm hypoallergenic.
So, yeah, it hurts and I'm trying to, I'm looking up home remedies on the internet right now.
I have all the remedy here.
It's called Vicks VapoRub in a tube.
All I have to say is...
This week was a lot of Final Fantasy.
I played a lot of Final Fantasy, leveling my characters, and then what else did I do?
I did some other stuff.
I think I played some more Vice City, or not Vice City, San Andreas, and that's pretty much it.
Slow week.
So, yeah, that's about all.
Alright, my week and my day.
I played a lot of Halo 2 this week.
Which I'm sure a lot of you guys are very proud to hear.
I'll tell you what though, man, we were talking about this a little bit on Outside the Box on Thursday, but the Xbox Live stuff is so detailed, it's crazy.
Being able to go onto Bungie.net and see your statistics down to, you can pull up a map of a game you just played and look at where you were killed and when, by who, it's crazy.
And what weapon they used to kill you?
It's just insane the amount of statistics they have for that.
So I've been having fun playing that online.
Although yesterday I did not have fun.
Well, I'll get into that in the FU's of the week.
And then, what else did I do this week?
I'm not a whole lot Bomani related.
Because of Halo 2, my DDR diet fizzled pretty quickly there.
Coincidence?
Absolutely not.
As far as the rest of my week and my day, I didn't really do a whole lot, although I did go to Rice Princess, you know her from Outside the Box on Thursday nights.
She had her Harry Potter birthday party on Friday, and that was a lot of fun because we drank butter beer, and I drank all sorts of liquor, and I passed out on the floor.
In great tradition of me going to a party at Rice Princess and Lanky Styles' house, I passed out halfway through the party.
And I really, I lost big time on Harry Potter trivia.
That made me sad.
But you know, since I don't read the books, I was kind of screwed from the beginning.
But then, this is the weird thing.
Then, the next night, after the Harry Potter party, the next night, what do they show on TV?
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.
Coincidence?
I think not.
I think it's a big fat coincidence.
You shut up.
All right.
That's pretty much it for my week of my day.
I don't have a whole lot exciting to report.
Although there is a lot of interesting stuff going on locally.
Now, I know that we are an international show.
We've got listeners in Canada, Japan, everywhere, and all across the U.S.
But sometimes we like to talk about what's going on in our neck of the woods here in NorCal, in Sacramento, the area where we're at.
We've heard a very interesting rumor.
And, Mel, you actually were the one that started perpetuating this rumor, because I guess you've heard this from the horse's mouth.
Well, you'll get the point in a second.
Derby Owners Club is coming to Sacramento from Milpitas.
It's leaving Milpitas.
Bye-bye.
And it's coming to Roseville Golf Land where games go to die.
Yes, that does put a tear in my eye.
I guess probably there's a couple reasons why it's coming up there.
I think it's gone to the point where Milpitas, you know, you had a lot of people who were interested in the beginning and obviously it garnered a lot of, you know, people coming through a lot of traffic.
And then a couple factors, I mean you got D&B which is like about a mile and a half, two miles away which has it.
It obviously pulls a lot of money and I think some of the older folks like going there for the simple fact you can actually like get drunk and play.
Exactly.
And you know all that kind of stuff.
And you don't have to deal with birthday parties.
Just seriously.
So and obviously Roseville is a pretty high traffic area I mean from what I hear.
and there's none left.
Yes, if you love underage girls in bikinis, you will love Roseville Golf Land.
I love Roseville Golf Land.
I heart.
It's going to be the first one up in that region of California, like SACTO, and I know there are a lot of people up here who liked the game and had come down and played it and still keep their horses around.
And yes, Derby Owners Club is like
Initial D for Rednecks.
I know for a fact from last week's show, Iguana Girl and Islander are all about Derby Owners Club.
They'll be there.
I will have to hang my head in shame and go into that place, and I swore I'd never go back.
But it doesn't just end with Derby Owners Club.
That's the weird thing.
Jamie, I know you're going to go in for Derby Owners Club.
You've got to.
And maybe get some kids thrown out.
My horses were stolen, so why?
You have to make new ones.
I'll hook you up with some of my breeds.
There you go.
I miss my tiger horse.
There you go.
But the weird thing is, now we're hearing this crazy rumor.
Crazy rumor!
I don't even know if I should say it, but I have a big mouth, so I'm going to.
I figure if it's posted on the internet, I can say it.
If it's on the internet, it must be true.
If it's on the internet, it must be true, but rumor is that Sacramento is going to get 2DX again.
And it's coming courtesy of Camelot Golf Land.
Sorry, guys.
That's the rumor we hear, that Camelot Golfland's 2DX machine is coming up here.
I'm sorry, but not really.
I don't... I think that's a little more... I think the source is more reliable than the usual 2DX is coming to my neck of the woods source.
But I still have such skepticism, because I just... And the rumor is it's supposed to be upgraded to red by the time it gets there.
Yippee!
But the thing is, is that...
I just, I would be so scared for that machine because it would die very quickly when all the kids start pounding on it with their wet little Golfland slide fingers and just, the Monty machines don't deserve to be treated that way.
No, they don't.
But I mean, I think, like I said, it's, when it all boils down to the bottom line, I mean, are more people going to come out to, like, friggin' Livermore to go play 2DX or, like, Sacto?
I mean, you take your pick.
What, are you talking on Sacramento now?
I'm kidding.
No, I'm just, no, I was saying, you know, people are going to come to SACTO, not Livermore, you know, or whatever Camelot is.
That is Livermore, yeah.
I think, I don't know.
Oh.
No, I think that's in the south somewhere.
It's the Anaheim.
Oh, the Anaheim one?
Oh, okay, my bad.
I think.
Okay.
I don't know.
Wow.
I'm not sure about geography.
That's right, that's right.
I think that's the one that has the really bad tunnel vision screen.
Oh, the one where you have to... No, no, no, that was Shiggle.
That was Shiggle.
Shiggle had the night vision one.
But didn't Shiggle's machine go to Camelot?
I'd not be surprised when Shiggle closed down.
I think so.
I think Shiggle's machine went to Camelot, and now it might be coming to Rozo.
Shiggle is now an apartment complex, if I remember right.
Yeah, Shiggle is dead like disco.
Too many acronyms!
Alright.
Well, we'll see if that's true or not.
We do know the Derby Owners Club thing is true.
Where did you hear that from, anyway?
Um, I actually heard that from the management, from Milpitas Golf and Management himself.
Wow.
I bet they were sad to see it go.
I don't know, I mean, I mean, yeah, they're obviously, you know, kind of sad, but At least there's more space for the birthday parties!
That's probably part of the reason, but I think, like I said, more so, it got to the point where they'd already, like, capped out as far as how many people will play, it's like, you kind of go to a point where you start low, start low, and then you eventually start getting a lot of, you know, people playing, and then, like, almost any other game, you outgrow it, and there was only, like,
So many hardcore people that still stayed around and played.
I mean, they're obviously in an uproar right now.
But it's like they're having their farewell send-off this weekend.
Like, they had a G1 tournament.
So it's like they have a bunch of people playing.
It's like a hundred bucks to enter.
Jeez.
Seriously, these people are like freaking jeez when it comes to playing this game.
I mean, they're like, yeah, I got a 30th generation, you know, Thunderboy Princess, and he can't be beat on dirt, and et cetera, et cetera, and...
It's, I mean, I'd be into tournaments if it didn't cost a hundred bucks a pop to play, you know.
Is it true that there's celebrities that come to play?
Um, yeah, actually.
It's funny enough, um, the people that, like, as far as celebrities that are interested in it are mostly athletes.
D&B, Milpitas, Santa Clara
and a lot more.
All right.
Well, hopefully, maybe we'll start seeing some celebrities at Roseville Golf Line, though I doubt it.
You never know.
You probably might see some... Maybe Schwarzenegger.
That's the only celebrity that lives in Sacramento.
Oh, that and, like, the Kings.
Oh, bastard, you horse!
I'm going to whip you!
I'm going to whip you!
I'm going to whip you like the Indian casinos!
If you do not win, I will gulp you!
On that note, we're going to go to a break.
We're going to continue the... Girly horse!
Girly horse!
You're a girly horse!
A silly little girly horse.
Welcome to Orange Laundry, everybody.
I am going to get to that announcement, but we'll go to a break first, because I like announcements after breaks.
It's just me.
In this break, another brand new Ultramix 2 song, as spoiled by the website, which went up over the weekend.
If you want a link to that, just visit orangelaundry.com.
We have a link right there.
It's like our top news story.
Enter...
In this break, oh hello, we're just joined by Explicit randomly during that break.
That's alright, we're going to go to a break right now.
This song is, the interesting thing about this song, it's also in that other dancing game.
And we'll talk about that and how interesting that must be.
The song is Vanilla Ninja and it's called Tough Enough.
I really like this song.
Oh, it's an awesome song.
And it was like my favorite song in that other dancing game.
We're going to talk about that when we come back.
We'll be right back after this.
Baby, I'll be the strong one to survive All for me to be the light
and the Lonely Freak, Queen of the Broken Shield.
So keep on picking the palm leaves, pick it, don't stop, don't feel, run away, go for the fire, baby, that's up to now.
So keep on living, don't stop, even the devil, we can get you in the season of heartbreak, baby, that's up to now.
Never trust my smiley face Because I can change all your dreams And my tears can't fade
Don't keep on thinking the bomb is ticking, don't stop, don't fear, run away before the fire, baby, that's up to none Don't keep on living the song, not even the devil's free, get you in the deep of the heartbreak, baby, that's up to none
I don't need you there, cause I need you there, all tonight Just keep on kicking the ball, miss if you don't stop, don't be around the way, go for the fire, baby, that's up to none Just keep on living, don't stop, even the devil is free to catch you in the deep of the heartbreak, baby, that's up to none
All right, we're going to do one more song here in this Ultramix 2 break.
We're going to do... Whoops, nope, not that.
That's not in Ultramix 2.
We're going to do... Which one did I want to do here?
Ah, here it is.
This is an interesting song.
The band is called Or If Is.
Like, or if is.
Get it?
And it's called I Spy.
Enjoy.
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
easier to dance to than that freaking catch up song Orange Lounge Radio we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio and that break you heard or if this or if this
Or if it isn't, with a song called I Spy, and before that, Vanilla Ninja with Tough Enough.
Now, I remember when I first heard that song, I was kind of like, wait a minute, I've heard this before.
And I was like, where the hell have I heard this before?
Oh my god, this song was on In The Groove when I went back and played it in Jersey a few months ago.
Coincidence?
What the hell happened there?
I don't know, but I would be surprised if, you know, I mean, because Vanilla Ninja is a German group, I would be surprised if they just kind of like were of the opinion, hey, let's whore out our song to, you know, as many people as possible, and that very well might have been the case.
Now, obviously, since, you know, games are tested and planned for months in advance, this song was included in Ultimix 2 before In The Groove was ever released, right?
Honestly, I don't know the timing on that one.
I'm pretty sure it was.
I think so, but we'll see.
So, this is very interesting.
Anything else you want to share?
It's the only song in Ultramix 2 that has a video, right?
That has a music video?
It does have a music video, yes.
Interesting.
And they're not some bad-looking girls, either.
I mean, kind of like, you know, take Vixen or any of those female hair metal bands and kind of pop them up a little, and yeah.
you got Vanilla Ninja and they actually have a website out there and all that kind of stuff and I wish I knew German so I could get myself a free autograph.
So if anyone can do some German translation for me, holler back.
Autograph bitte.
So can you tell us anything else about the video?
Because I'm assuming if we could look hard enough we could probably find the video, but I don't know.
It's a pretty, you know, rockin' video.
It's like, obviously you've got the vampires playing.
I guess the best way to describe it in a nutshell is, if you took Christina Aguilera's Dirty video and made it, like, presentable so, like, the ESRB wouldn't nail us.
It's kind of, well, it's just more so the setting, but it's a cool video.
I mean, it's a hell of a lot less scandalous than Do That Thing from Ultramix One, so...
Oh no, we're talking about Vanilla Ninja's Tough Enough from Ultramix 2.
Yeah, like you said, I know you've been out of it, but there's a whole lot of Ultramix 2 news this week, so.
That's alright.
Well, actually, if you want to see, because actually the way we know that that video is in there is that actually if you go to the Ultramix 2 website, there's still one of the screenshots they have has the video in it, so you can kind of get a little glimpse of what it looks like there, so.
So.
But they're easy on the eyes, for the most part.
Definitely.
I think, actually, because when somebody on DDR Freak made the connection that that was the Vanilla Ninja video, I think they actually linked to the video, I want to say.
See, I think you can go check it out over there.
I just was too lazy to check it out myself.
All right.
So, moving on, we just got some more guests in the house here.
Like you, Sal, how was your week?
How was your day?
Pretty good.
It's been working.
Yep.
Wow, it's so weird to hear you and work together.
You know what?
Fuck you, buddy.
It's so weird to hear you and attractive in the same sentence.
Wait, nobody said that, though.
Anyway, yeah, just have the big...
and so on.
So at one point I was like, god damn it, and I just went to the first place, I knew where there was a bed.
I wasn't exactly going to go into your roommate's room and pass out on their bed.
That would have been interesting.
That would have been kind of funny, actually.
Yeah, but we don't need to get into that.
That's right, that's right.
Anyway, other than that, been working and making the dough.
Yep, good stuff.
Alright, good stuff.
Explicit also joined us during the break there.
How was your week, how was your day?
Thanks for watching!
Well, sort of, in a way.
So what, you have like your weekend bed and your weekday bed?
Or is there one bedroom that's for the ladies, and then one bedroom... Oh, yeah!
Speaking of ladies, speaking of ladies, I'm supposed to go to a strip club like next two weeks to celebrate to my cousin's 18th birthdays.
Guess I'm gonna have to eat some pussy again.
You know what?
Go club.
I don't need to hear that.
Gold Club Center Poles.
Wow, I was wondering when this show was going to go in the toilet.
Thank you.
But I missed what it was about.
That's quite all right.
Anyway.
I already talked about Halo 2.
That was pretty much my week.
Anything new going on at Paradise Island, the place where you work?
You're still working there, right?
Yeah.
Anything new going on?
We might get a new arcade vendor.
There's a possibility since, for some stupid reason, they're not opening up their machines anymore.
Because pad vending is like... I think we're losing contract and stuff.
We might get a vendor from the Bay Area and stuff so we can get... Oh, yeah.
So I could talk to them by trying to get Beatmania 2DX read there.
That'd be nice.
Interesting.
Interesting.
Is it a bitch to work through a vendor?
Hell yeah!
I had a deal with them during the last tournament for FU.
Well, I'm not sure if I had a deal with them again in February for Sacktown Smackdown tournament.
Yes, I'm organizing another tournament in Sacramento.
All right, we'll be there, I'm sure.
It's early February.
I'm sure we'll be there.
All right.
Let's see.
I'm just preparing for SVGL3.
SVGL3, the tournament in December.
That's right, I completely forgot about that.
I'm definitely going to that.
I just kind of forgot that it was right around the corner.
Didn't they announce that tournament, like, months ago?
Yeah, it was supposedly during the summertime, but they moved it to the winter, I'm assuming.
Yeah, interesting.
And it was supposedly canceled because I assume, like, DCB doesn't want to be the main organizer for it anymore.
Well, I'm sure somebody will pick it up if he didn't want to.
I don't know what's going on.
Someone else picked it up already.
I've been so out of the loop on that stuff.
I was so out of the loop ever since the drama and shit coming around.
And for the downs I'll announce later.
It's going to be one hell of a ride for the FUs on that one.
I'm looking forward to it.
I kind of didn't get to talk enough about the whole Vanilla Ninja coincidence there within the groove and stuff.
Are you afraid of the backlash that might be coming?
I don't know, kind of hard to say.
You know there's going to be critics out there.
You already kind of know that with the step data, that's the first thing people always complain about with the new DDR mix is the steps.
Somebody will not like the steps, that's just a given.
But now you've got the fact that now people have something they're going to keep comparing it to, and it's kind of like, ugh.
I didn't like the competition stepped out of very much, and I'm not saying that, you know, as a biased opinion, I mean, I got more or less a lot of confidence in the people who I know who did the stepped out of for Ultramix 2, but in the groove, I mean, you know, obviously that's where it came from, obviously, it's like, you know, I mean, there's some, it's,
almost half of it was like what you would expect already but they have a knack for throwing in like odd rhythms for like no reason right like yeah you just kind of wonder if they're listening to the same song you are you know but that's just hopefully it's not the same edit oh no no not I'll try like I said if I can say ours is better obviously ours is different okay and you know I mean I have to you know personally
You know, back it up because I did do some of the step data for some of the modes.
I think it's interesting more than anything else.
You're going to have the same song in two different games.
Two different cuts and two different sets of steps.
Very interesting to see the differences there.
At least yours isn't going to have mines, right?
Oh, God, no.
Thank you.
All right.
And for the record, I saw Miklatov make a comment about, like, all the girls being looking like men.
No, they don't.
Only the one girl who has the bad, like, 70s ABBA hair.
Only, you know, yeah, her bangs kind of throw her off, but she cleaned up since.
All right.
And they still have that one girl, the youngest girl, who looks like Pornikova.
Pornikova.
Yeah.
Anything that looks like Pornokova is good to me.
This year we have 18 November, which is going to be the big day that 8th Style Consumer Version is out, Poppin' Music 10 is out, and DDR Festival is all going to come out.
And now we find out Ultramix 2 got pushed back to an 18 November ship day.
So the Americans get in on it too a little bit.
So it's going to be a very big week.
So this week's show, this next week's show is going to be huge.
Tonight we're just mediocre, but next week, huge.
This is an orgy waiting to happen.
I just read this from Bimani Style about last Tuesday.
DJ Paranoia posted that Jason Eno is wanting to bring out 2DX in the US.
What is your reaction about that?
Obviously, who in the Bimani community would not want to see 2DX in America?
There's no doubt that there has been enough music games within the past
3-4 years
How much are people going to pay for a peripheral to a game that is completely, absolutely new?
You're not sure about that?
Then you've got to think... But maybe the success of games like Donkey Konga and hopefully Taiko Drum Master, maybe that would be incentive, hopefully.
Okay, that's true.
Maybe.
Alright, well let's take it one step further.
You got people, like I said, B-Money fans who would like to see, you know, a US version.
They probably would want to buy it.
That said, how difficult do you make it on the get-go?
I mean, you know, do you want to make it easy enough for people to get it?
Because, I mean, truth be told, 2DX is not an easy B-Money, you know.
No.
I mean, like, when you compare, you know, like, the major four, for example, like, I'll say 2DX, like, if you take the hardest song from DDR compared to, like, the hardest song in Guitar Freaks to, like, you know, 2DX, I mean, 2DX is a pretty difficult game.
I mean, you know, I mean, of course it can be beat within reasonable time and such, but then you gotta think, you know, it's like, well, are we gonna have a beginner mode for US?
Are we only gonna make it up to, like, you know, the hardest song is maybe just the normal seven?
Is it gonna be a flashing seven?
You gotta wonder about, like, being able to appease new fans, but at the same time, you don't want to insult the intelligence of, like... The loyalists.
Yeah, of the, you know, hardcore people, so it's kind of a hard... I think, I mean, just coming from me, I think that would be a little bit of a hard thing to gauge.
I mean, I don't think it's impossible, and I mean, like anyone, I would like to see it come over.
Whether it will or not, I mean, you never know.
I mean, obviously, with the success Fiamani has been having, it's...
It's making a case stronger and stronger each day, so whenever it happens, you know.
From your perspective, having been on the inside at one point, is there anything you think we could do as Pomani fans to help?
Like, are petitions going to help, or is it a lost cause, or what?
Well, I don't know.
I have really yet to see a petition really, you know, like, make a difference in anything.
Right.
You know, I mean, last time I ever saw that was part of recall, but, you know, that's a whole different story altogether.
But, um, I think...
It's more or less, you really just got to support Bimani and you just got to, I mean, it doesn't hurt to drop a letter into customer service once in a while to Konami and say, yeah, we're really interested and all that kind of stuff.
I mean, sure, when you write it off and send it off, you think, ah, no one's ever going to pay attention, but you'd be surprised when like, you know, it's as a product manager, I noticed for like any video game, you always got to keep your eyes and ears open because, you know, just like the slightest bit of, you know, idea or just, you know, hints or suggestions people have,
You know, fans have a lot more influence than they think.
I mean, obviously, they're not going to make the game all by themselves, but I think you have to figure that kind of stuff.
I mean, if you want to have a successful game, you want people to buy it, you give them what they want, by and far.
Very interesting.
Very cool.
Siggy, anything else you want to ask for 4.1?
That's the only question I wanted to know.
Okay, cool.
Looking forward to 8-Style Consumer?
Yeah.
All right.
Call us back next week and let us know what you think because I'm too poor to get it, so I don't know if we're going to get to look at it.
Sure.
Thanks, guys.
All right.
Take it easy, man.
All right.
Bye-bye.
Very good question.
I did not know that that kind of stuff was posted over on Bomani Style, but that's what I get for not being in the loop on the different forums.
So, interesting.
All right, let's get to that big announcement while we wait for another call to come in.
One interesting thing that was brought up on the show last week is that, hmm, is there a possibility that in the future that Orange Lounge Radio and DDR Freak Radio might get together and do something?
And the answer is yes.
Starting this Friday, you'll be able to catch the Orange Lounge Radio Rewind over on DDR Freak Radio.
That's the big announcement.
And if you've been paying attention to DDR Freak's site feedback forum, you'd already know that because it was announced earlier today, but that's alright.
But maybe you want to go over to that forum and let them know what great news it is to hear that we're going to be doing that.
Hopefully we'll be able to have a Gwana Girl on the show again and do more kinds of things to partner up with DDR Freak Radio and let them know that there's lots of love for internet radio stations.
There's plenty of love for all of us.
So that's exciting.
I'm really excited.
I think it'll help open up our show to a whole new audience over there and I think it's going to bring their radio station something different.
I don't know if it's going to work out good for them because our show kind of sucks, but you know, no, I'm kidding.
Our show rocks.
Listen to it every week.
What, Lanky Sound?
I said, yeah, you've got self-confidence.
Let me put it this way.
If I wasn't confident in this show, I would have stopped on episode three or four.
This is 118 now.
Yeah, how long were you playing DDR?
Shut up.
All right.
How long were you playing DDR?
Excuse me?
Yeah.
Who was in Sacramento?
Yeah, that's what I thought.
Yeah, shut up.
Yeah.
1999. 1999.
How are you doing over there, DarkSakura, by the way?
I haven't heard a lot from you tonight, which is rare.
I hate my nose.
Aww.
So did Michael Jackson.
Yeah, but he had the money to go buy him a new one.
I need one that has completely dry sinuses.
Yeah, you just need new sinuses, though.
Yeah.
Your nose is fine.
I think I'm getting high off of this Vic stuff, though.
Awesome.
I'm doing my homework, so... Yeah, I'm doing my homework on ethics in business and contracts.
It's very boring.
Fascinating.
Very, very fascinating.
By fascinating, you mean boring.
Yes, it is.
To answer some questions from the chat room about the whole DDR Freak Radio syndication, it's going to be 6 p.m.
Pacific time on Friday.
That's awesome.
On DDR Freak Radio.
I'll be at work.
Well, tune in from work.
I don't know what to tell you.
You know, that's a good idea.
I have to try that.
You should try that.
There you go.
And just so you know, the Wednesday rewinds here on Orange Lounge Radio, they're going to change a little bit.
Since we have our rewinds over on DDR Freak Radio now, we're going to bring you classic and moldy episodes of Orange Lounge Radio that are freshly fermented.
So, like, year-old episodes we're going to start bringing you on Wednesday nights.
Like, old stuff, so...
That'll be the little change there.
Oh, we are getting another call.
I need to pay attention to the Skype line once in a while.
Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.
Well, Legend of Zaku here.
Hi, Zaku, how you doing?
Yeah, let me add a counterstatement to what they said about American 2DX release.
Okay.
Seeing as, you know, going on the basis of the last presidential election and the fact that a vast majority of this country is red, and I want to follow up on that word just to keep it there.
Wait, wait, wait.
Wouldn't that mean that 2DX Red might have some success here?
No, I didn't mean that.
What I meant is the red states.
In particular, the fact that you're releasing a seven key game with a turntable and the fact that it's going really fast and it's going to, you know, I don't know if we're prepared for the attention span that it will, because that will demand a lot.
Especially from Americans who are Alright, Mel's got his hand up.
Mel's got his hand up.
And I suppose that's why Omaha, of all places, got 2DX Red before everyone else in America.
Whom?
Hey, I live in New York.
Hey, I live in New York.
We're lucky my state has a 9-star.
And the only 9-star on the East Coast is my dad.
I'm sorry, were you saying something?
Basically, let me put it this way.
I don't know if 2DX will sell here.
Let me sum it up.
You're saying that basically, and your tangent to the election aside, ignoring all that, basically what you're saying in a nutshell is that America is too stupid for 2DX.
I don't know.
Maybe.
I'm not sure.
What you're mainly saying is that people who vote for somebody you don't agree with are stupid.
No, no, no.
You're misunderstanding my point.
You're misunderstanding me right now.
Look, listen.
What I'm trying to say is that in a video game country, you know, in a country where basically the vast majority of video games are like what?
Right now it's mostly, you know, Halo.
It's like first person shooting sports and fighting games.
Dancing games is up there.
It makes them, you know.
Make some highlights and a few, and took the limelight a little bit, but you're talking about something that, you know, I don't know, I mean, certain games, the same way that DDR supposedly came here, because it wasn't, it didn't plan this to arrive, it only came with a, it only came with like a few thousand copies, thinking that it wasn't going to sell, because of the cultural differences.
That's what I'm trying to say.
Okay, you know what, that sounds very familiar.
You actually sound like the president of Konami around circa 2000.
This is when Jason Neils had bought for about three years to get DDR in America.
Somehow Jason had begged and clawed and did everything in his power to get DDR released into America.
The president only made them press about 20,000 copies or so.
He was absolutely
Thank you for watching!
and that's not even counting the ones with like a bundle so and remember this is at a time when music games did not have nearly as much fanfare as it does now I mean now that not only do you have Konami but you know you had like people from harmonics that did frequency amplitude now you know karaoke revolution that you got the MTV you know so I'm just saying you know I mean it's legitimate
I can understand why there's only two forms of Bomani here, DDR and Karaoke Revolution.
Added a third and tried to expand gradually from what's already there in Japan.
I'm not sure.
I mean, I know both did well.
I don't know.
It's kind of like, in a sense, it might be a slippery slope on one side, but as long as fans can back it up and regular people can learn how to be tolerant and embrace it,
and there's a good chance he'll sell and make a repeat of the last two.
Alright, the bottom line is, if it came out, you'd buy it, right?
I would buy it, no doubt.
At least the support would be there.
Alright, we gotta move on, but thank you for calling, Zaku.
Have a good one.
I just want to make a really quick comment.
Very interesting perspective.
I want to make a really quick comment.
A lot of games in Japan never come here because people think we're not going to get it.
There's just too many cultural differences.
Look at games like Katamari Damashii I was just thinking the same thing Animal Crossing, Katamari Damashii Incredible Crisis didn't sell incredibly But it was pretty tough to find It had a following Even Bust a Move That was like right around the same time DDR first came out When the first Bust a Move game came out The first Bust a Move had been out I had the second one before the first one came out
And essentially, like, all that stuff becomes cult hits.
I mean, like, Parappa was, you know, first Japan, if I'm not mistaken, or whatever.
And then, yeah, it came out here, and it sold about, like, 30,000, 40,000 units, which, essentially, in the game industry, 25,000 is considered, like, a cult hit.
So, you know, and just like DDR, the minute you get a cult following, you know, if the game is good enough and has staying power and you have enough fans that back it, it's going to blow up eventually.
You know, it will run its course.
I mean, and it's just... That's usually how they all start.
Whenever something new comes out, it's a quote-unquote cult hit.
I mean, this is maybe... People are going to probably bash me for saying this, but first-person shooters didn't used to be the most popular game in the world.
But then ever since, you know, Doom came out, just it started going...
and so on.
I think, you know what though, Saku does bring up an interesting perspective.
I think what basically he's saying and how Mel makes the comparison where, you know, this was the same reservations that Konami had about DDR several years ago is that people wouldn't get it.
Well, they're just having those same concerns all over again.
I don't think that comes as a surprise to any of us, basically.
I think with a good marketing campaign, I think it would definitely move.
Well, I think a lot of it has to do with what is 2DX's niche, too?
Like, you know, DDR makes you lose your butt a little bit, right?
And then 2DX is just fans of music.
People who like the feeling that they're creating a song, but with no talent.
No, just kidding.
I'm just kidding.
I'm just kidding.
There's a lot of people out there who play 2DX that are extremely talented, but it's easier to make...
The music, you could say.
Playing 2DX, then actually going and producing music from the ground up.
And I get, everybody, I think, gets that feeling.
I remember the first time I ever played Hip Hop Mania, Complete Mix 1, when it first came out in America, way back in the day, and I played, you know, was it Believe Again or something like really old?
I was just like, I feel like I'm making music.
I press a key, and then I press the key again, and this turntable's cool.
You know, and I love music.
I've grown up
I've grown up loving music and I still love music.
I think a lot of, you know, obviously a lot of people love music, so I think that, you know, you just point at these things in a sales campaign or something and, you know, sell it off as music.
Well, I just kind of hope that the success of Donkey Kongo, which I believe has been a fairly successful game so far, Taiko No... I'm sorry, Taiko Drum Master, Taiko no Tachigen in Japan, a little early to tell, I think, with that one so far, if it's been successful or not, but hopefully if these games that come bundled with peripherals are somewhat successful...
Hopefully, maybe Konami will go, okay, maybe America feels a little different about peripherals now.
Because I think a long time ago it was kind of like, peripherals don't do well here.
Super Scope, Power Pad, you know, everything pretty much, Tank, U-Force, Power Glove.
How much is an official Konami dance pad right now?
Still about 50 bucks?
I don't know if you can find one.
I mean, to get an official Konami pad, you'd have to buy a bundle, usually.
I mean, if you go to, like, some, like, store like, say, Toys and Joys, yeah, you can probably get for, like, $30, $40.
But the bundle, I think they run about somewhere around $79 to $80.
I believe they are selling an Ultramix 2 bundle on Amazon right now for $59.99.
Okay, so what I'm saying is that when the Konami pads officially came out originally, they were over $50 a piece.
to import them before they came out here, they were usually like 70-something bucks a piece.
Obviously, the price has dropped, you know, substantially.
Well, Mad Catz had a lot to do with that, too, with their, you know, bargain basement dance pads.
Well, no, I'm talking about official pads that are actually quality-made pads.
And, you know, I think the same could be done with Konami controller.
I mean, ever since the 2DX...
official Konami controller, not the arcade style.
Ever since they came out, they've been around $100.
And they still are around $100.
I'm sure they could work something out, or they could drop the price a little bit for an American release.
I mean, Sony does it all the time.
Maybe Konami could outsource a company to make a quality controller.
That'd be interesting.
And take a little bit of loss for a little while until the game gets, who knows, maybe...
Sony makes peripherals.
Why can't Sony do it?
They got money.
So, in other words, Konami, if you're listening, just take a chance.
Oh, my God.
Take a chance on me.
No, stop it.
No ABBA.
Take a chance.
Is there ABBA in DDR?
Not yet.
Then don't bring it up.
Okay.
As long as ASCII does not make a 7-key one, ASCII is probably the worst 5-key controller ever made.
Wait, is that the same company that made the ASCII pad for the Super Nintendo?
Probably.
Well, that was, I think, at the time, the greatest controller ever made, so what the fuck happened to them?
Management.
I don't know.
All right.
Maybe.
All right.
We're going to go to a break.
We got some more Ultramix 2 songs we're going to play for you guys.
This next one, it's actually a really long one, so we're going to kind of shorten it a little bit.
I'm going to kind of start it here in the middle for you guys.
It's a group called Creo.
I think I pronounced that right.
Creo?
Close enough.
It's K-R-E-O.
Creo.
Or if you said it backwards, it would be Orek.
I don't know.
Anyway, the song is called Burn For You.
And this is a new song that's going to be on Ultramix 2.
And don't play this at your local clinic.
It might be a bad sign.
Thank you for watching!
Let me tell you something you don't know
Tell you something you don't know
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio Starting the Eurobeat party apparently, no, sorry about that That's what happens when I have things on repeat, it shouldn't be Initial D Initial D
We are back here on episode number 118.
What are you boys talking about over there?
What are you boys talking about back there?
Oh, we're gushing over the Rumble Roses soundtrack.
Oh, you're right.
We're talking about boobs.
Well, it's kind of relevant because the game comes out this week here, so.
I thought it just came out on like Friday or something.
Did it?
Yeah, I heard it came out.
Hmm, okay.
Well, I just know that this week I've got to go pick up a few games, so.
Am I coming through on the mic?
Do you have money for that?
Yeah, I got a little money.
Just teasing you.
Can you check the levels?
Am I coming through?
Yeah, you're coming through.
I can hear you.
That's why I have these big space-age headphones on, so I can hear if the microphones are coming through okay.
Yeah, now you look like a real DJ.
Yeah, I know.
This is the coolest system I'm ever going to get to the real thing.
I mean, you've got the headphones on.
You're not particularly attractive.
Just kidding.
I've got two turntables and a microphone.
Uh-huh.
Okay, Beck.
Where it's at, huh?
No, but... Continue.
Continue.
On to your topic, if you have one.
Well, I was going to say Rumble Roses, but that's alright.
You were talking to Mel about the voice acting, right?
Oh, yeah.
I was just asking if I ever asked him about the voice acting, if there was anything up with it.
I mentioned it last week, but I couldn't remember it quite like you can.
Okay.
Well, no, I just was explaining to him, and I'm assuming it's not the game itself.
I doubt Konami would release a game with
Seriously mismatched speech to the lip syncing, because it was like, in the videos I had, the voices were coming out of the wrong people.
So I'm assuming it was just because somebody was skipping, whoever was playing over at IGN was skipping through dialogue, and it, you know, you know how it is.
And by the way, don't blame us people over in the U.S.
for the horrible dialogue within the game.
We were only given one day to rewrite all that stuff.
So even the producer admitted as much after we did some damage control.
He said we should have been writing from the get-go.
You know what's interesting, though, is that a lot of the earlier reviews of Rumble Roses have good things to say about the music.
Very good things to say about the music.
Oh, a lot of people I've been reading the reviews have been saying it's just a good game all around.
I mean, I think, you know, the chicks thing has a big thing to do with that.
But hey, it looks like a great game.
Well, I think what Rumble Roses has best going for it is the fact that, I mean, you capture a lot of things that wrestling people like.
I mean, they like wrestling and most, um, the wrestling, they use the engine from Yuke's, which was the one that's been used for SmackDown for the past couple of seasons.
So the people who buy the game have something they're already familiar with as far as gameplay.
And then, of course, it's, you know, the
100,000 megapixels or whatever, you know.
So the characters are very detailed and, you know, they've got an engine for jiggling and all that kind of stuff.
I'm thinking, you know, so it's, I mean, what's not to like?
Visually great?
Gameplay great?
I mean, if you don't like wrestling, I mean, then... Well, wait a minute, that's the weird thing.
I don't like chicks and I don't like wrestling, yet I'm interested in this game.
Okay, wait, wait, wait.
That's because you're gay.
and... No, no, no, that's the reason why you're interested because you wish you could be as hot as these girls.
Okay, yeah, I wish I could be hot.
Anyway, no, um...
Yeah, blanket statement aside.
Anyway, here's just kind of a little joke, but on a serious note, kind of, I don't know.
Well, no, not any serious, just a joke.
Yeah, it's got the whole engine for jiggling and stuff.
You're not necessarily a boob guy, which you're weird if you aren't, but you're more an ass guy.
They got some pretty good accurate ass jiggling, too.
I would say I'm more of an ass guy, and I still don't care.
And again, you're gay.
What the hell?
What are you saying, Miklo?
You saying I'm wrong?
What am I wrong about?
Anyway, so anyway, about the voice acting, what?
Thank you, thank you.
The voice of reason, one of our females in the showroom, DDArcoholic says, when will the games with the gyrating penis come out?
I want to know when my Thunder Down Under wrestling game comes out.
If you want giant gyrating penis, that would have been in Katamari Dimash.
Yeah.
Actually, no, there's a series of games in Japan that are shooters, that all the characters... Shooter games.
Floorwalk is grabbing his testicles, he's like, oh no!
No, not that kind of shit, like a side-scrolling shooter game, that are... The characters, your ship or whatever, is like a...
I know, I said blanket statement aside, obviously I wasn't serious.
But I am with you, Miklatov.
Just kidding.
It was fun to punch you anyway.
I do not bring a Bunga Bunga.
We do not need finger to the ass action here.
Oh, man.
Okay, not that kind of ass.
Anyway, um, I just thought I'd let you know, because, you know, girls always say this, when do we get our guys, our hot guys in games?
Hot guys in games has been around since games came out.
Okay?
They've been putting artwork on old arcade games with big, muscly men, and they still put hot guys, quote-unquote, in video games nowadays.
Like, Karnov?
What's that?
Wait, what?
I can play with John Cena at home, so I'm happy.
I don't know who John Cena is.
How about this is a weird...
Hey, hey, how about this is a weird game right here.
Miniskirt Police.
Wait, did you surf for weird games like Google?
Yeah.
Okay.
Miniskirt Police.
It's a light gun game where I guess you take pictures of women in miniskirts.
Okay.
That's a Namco thing.
Go Namco.
Oh, yeah.
There's Namco for you.
Interesting.
They should have a motion capture version of that.
MoCap Miniskirt Police.
and you need a partner to play with in a miniskirt.
So it's not really a game.
It's just, yeah, anyway.
So... Hey, don't knock the Japanese games, though, because they brought us Radiant Silvergun.
Oh, yes.
Which I've got to play.
In an awesome spin-off called Ikaruga.
Yeah, but I got to play Radiant Silvergun Arcade Machine and that makes me feel special for the rest of my life.
On the now-vanished game land in Vegas.
Ooh, cool.
Radiant Silvergun is pretty.
Okay.
Go on, Rob.
Oh, hell.
Did I have another topic?
I knew I had something Ultramix 2 related.
I want to get to the cage match soon, too, but I guess we can do one more quick topic.
You know that some of the first early reviews of Ultramix 2 came out, and one of them has been making rounds on the Freak.
It's the one that was in GMR Magazine.
And apparently, they're not big fans of the game.
But man, the freak, they are tearing this guy apart.
Like, I was just reading this.
I'm looking at the thread here, page 160, I think it's 161 or 162 of the thread.
Somebody tried, like, harassing the guy on AOL and everything.
I'd say harassing, but you know, maybe borderline stalking the guy on AOL trying to say, What's wrong with you?
Fuck you, you fucking fuck!
No, I'm kidding.
It was more mature than that, but, you know, not by much.
I mean, you know, part of half of me is, you know, saying, Oh yeah, go, you know, stick up for us.
The other half is, you ain't even played the game yourself.
You know, what the hell do you know?
So, I mean, I think ultimately, you know, only God could judge us, and if he did, he'd give us an A+.
No, this is those fuckers!
Hi, this is Eris from GameStop.
Eris?
Are you dead?
Hi, this is Eris at GameStop.
Yes.
You've reserved a blank game.
And it's like, Eris is like a reference to Eris from Final Fantasy 7.
It's-a me, Mario!
I just wanted to let you know that your Sonic the Hedgehog game came in!
Mamma mia!
Even though, and people who have seen me play Final Fantasy 7 know this because I have my game saved at this one particular place.
so that I can take this shit out of Jenova again and watch Aerith die all over again.
Yes, it's a great thing to relive, right?
Oh my god, you guys, stop spoiling Final Fantasy 7.
I haven't played it yet.
She dies!
Get over it.
And I cheer.
Yeah, it's good.
The only thing, in my opinion, that can ruin Advent Children is if Aerith somehow comes back to life.
Oh my god, that would just... Okay, so, that being said,
You guys have no feelings.
Why?
Tifa is a much better woman.
She can kick ass.
I can't believe we're having this discussion, so I'm going to change the subject back to this review.
If I got a call from Eris from GameStop, I would run away.
Eris had codependency issues.
Yeah.
Oh my lord.
Well, if you want to join in the fun, they posted his AOL screen name and everything.
I just think that's kind of interesting that they got the whole little... I mean, for lack of a better term, I know it's not these same guys, but I can't help but think of the word be mafia to describe what's going on here.
I don't like using that term because I know it's not the same people, but you know what I mean.
It's still the same idea where these guys are just hounding this poor guy that was just reviewing and...
I mean, you never know.
Once a festival hits Japan, Japan critics are going to say, you know, it's not American enough.
Wow.
Good news is that some other reviews are coming out, and I think we've seen 7.5s and 8s, and average DDR scores are on the board.
I think, again, a lot of these people don't really... The folks that review hundreds and hundreds of games for the magazines and stuff, they don't have time to submerse themselves in the communities of all these games.
I don't think a lot of these folks maybe realize...
Just how different and how anticipated this game is in America just because it isn't a Japanese release, you know what I mean?
I don't know.
That's just my take on it.
It's finally like one of those games that seems to have very, very, very few ties to Japan other than the fact that, hey, the game was originally created there.
But it's like, you know, whole new interface, whole new game, whole new modes.
It's really, truly like an American production.
I think it's just kind of one of those things where it's just after time that series will have its own identity more than anything.
And that's all you can really, I mean, just I as a gamer, think originality and just like making, you know, like being a little different.
I mean, sure, you know, DDR is pretty universal as far as like within Konami itself and all, but if you got Ultramix 2 and it's like always kind of like that cutting edge type thing, it's like, well, you know, some people watch like M2, you know, as opposed to MTV or, you know, watch all those other niche shows because, you
You know, it's like, they already know they like the game, but they want to see it to its, you know, maximum potential or something different, and, you know, I mean, it's, why not?
Very interesting.
Apparently now, I'm getting a follow-up.
Apparently our old Orange Lounge Radio favorite, Al Mullet, is the one that's been doing a little bit of this AOL, harassing this guy.
Hey, he's the pusher for the cookies, so he gets the amnesty right away.
That's right.
But no, apparently he has responded.
We don't know the details yet, though.
I'm hearing this all secondhand, but maybe we'll... Keep checking the Freak for developments, because maybe something will get posted there.
Whoops.
I want my boyfriend to watch me play the game and start crying because the game makes him feel inadequate while I enthusiastically play the hell out of it.
Who said this?
DD Arcaholic.
Oh, I thought this was Rice Princess.
No, no.
That would have been funny, though.
That's great.
I'm sure she would have said it, too.
You know what, though?
That's happened.
That's all personal preference, what game makes you want to play it so much.
There's been times where Rice Princess was so hooked on the game where she would just play it all the time and we didn't really have time for much else.
That's just how it is.
You're a gamer.
You're in a relationship.
Charge!
Charge!
Last week in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, Jamie won it with a song, I guess it's some sort of parody song.
It was a little silly.
Five, four, three, one, off blast.
But it was very popular nonetheless, and it won our cage match with a sweeping victory.
It was Zlod with Electronic Supersonic, and that's the first song we're going to hear a clip of in tonight's cage match.
Now here's the thing.
Much to Loki's hatred, he does not like this song.
He's only pissed off because he's the one that usually puts the smart-ass songs in.
I'm debating whether to put a really shitty song or a really good song tonight.
Hold on.
I have to agree.
Papa Smurf was awesome.
Okay, hold on.
Way back in the day, back when you weren't in the hundreds yet in episodes, like probably not even in the 20s or something, I once, we didn't have three people for a cage match, so I once, I said, go ahead and put in one of my songs, and you're like, what is this?
God, I'm not ready for this.
And I put in an Aquabats song, which is a pretty popular Ska group.
And you said, I don't see that as a cage match song.
How is Dark Sakura's song, though it is very funny, any different than that?
It is not what you would see as a cage match song, but you didn't say anything.
Here's the thing, though.
The thing is, though, you're full of shit.
Shut up before I shove my cock in your mouth.
Shut up.
Where's my camera?
The cage match has evolved an awful lot the past, you know, 100 episodes we've been doing it.
I think it used to be the thing where it was like DDR, Guitar Freaks, 2DX songs.
Now it's kinda like cool stuff.
No, no, no, wait, wait, wait, okay, wait.
I'm totally calling bullshit because... There are still songs that I have said are not Cage Madge.
Just wait.
For about four weeks ago or five weeks ago, Matt put on a song by, um... No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
The song you put on by, um, Compufonic, uh, what's the name of the band?
Echo Image.
What's the name of that song?
Come Back.
That song is awesome, and you said, I don't see it as a cage match song.
I didn't, and I still don't.
It totally fits perfectly into the genre of music we play.
It was techno pop, or electro pop, or whatever.
I didn't, and I still don't.
Stick my foot up your ass.
What do I know, because it's the first song ever to have to be retired from the cage match, so obviously it doesn't come down to my opinion, it comes down to the opinion of the listeners.
So put that in your pipe and smoke it.
Whatever happened to the days when we used to say that we do this radio show for our amusement, not their amusement?
Well, we sold out like cheap whores.
What do you expect?
Thank you, Sal.
Thank you, Sal.
Can I have a hug?
Get away from me.
Can I have a hug?
I want a hug.
There.
We're going to put our differences aside.
Aww.
Don't try to grope me, get out of here.
Alright.
You're hugging, very provocative.
That was very erotic.
You gotta do that.
No, I'm kidding.
Alright, I'm kidding.
Why don't we make a video game out of that?
There we go.
Hug hug revolution.
There was that one game that was at the Natsume booth at E3.
Where you go around kissing people.
Yeah, Tulip.
Tulip.
Alright, anyway.
Hello, cage match, hello.
All right, we're going to get into this.
It's Electronic Supersonic.
You get to hear a clip of it because it won last week, and then you'll hear two new songs in their entirety.
And I can't wait to hear what, like you saw, has to say about my pick tonight.
He's going to love it.
Anyway... I thought we did piss Brad off on our show on here.
Sorry, sorry.
Here we go.
You can vote for this if you want.
It's a clip of song number one.
This is Zlod with Electronic Supersonic.
Enjoy.
Hey baby, wake up from your asleep.
We have arrived onto the future and the whole world is become... Electronic Supersonic Supersonic
Electronic Hey baby, ride with me away, we doesn't have much time My blue jeans is tight, so on to my love rocket climb Inside tank of fuel is not fuel, but love Above us, there is nothing above, but the stars above All systems gone, prepare for a down count 5, 4, 3, 1
Fly away in my space rocket You no need put money in my pocket The door is closed, I just lock it I put my go-plug in your socket The sun and sky is bright like fire You and me gets higher and higher
Only thing can stop us is flat tire.
Hey, love crusader, I want to be your space invader.
For you, I would descend the deepest moon crater.
I is more stronger than dark vapor.
Obey me, I is your new dictator.
For you is Venus, I am Mars.
With you, I is more richer than all the stars.
Make a wishes on a shooting stars.
Then for you, I will play on
All right, that was song number one in tonight's cage match.
Last week's winner is Zlod, Electronic Supersonic.
Wake up from your sleep.
Yeah, wake up from your sleep if you fell asleep during that.
If you haven't seen the video yet, somebody posted it on The Freak a while back.
I don't know if it got posted in our forums.
I don't think it did, but go check the random chat on The Freak and see if you can find it because it's pretty funny.
It's pretty funny.
All right, next up in the cage match, Loki's pick for this week.
Loki, what did you pick for us?
I picked Rammstein's song off their new album, it's called America, and it's a nice American hating song, and I hate America, so here we go.
Alright, here's song number two, Rammstein, and I just gotta say, now wait a minute.
See, Jamie puts in the song that I would expect Loki to put in, and now Loki is putting in the song I would expect Jamie to put in.
What is going on?
What in the hell is going on with this show?
I've played this song plenty of times on my show.
And I'm going to put in the song that nobody would put in.
So, here we go.
Song number two, Rammstein with America.
Enjoy.
We're all living in America, America
Thanks for watching!
Even if you turn around alone, let yourself be controlled a little.
I'll show you what's right.
We want to give a life.
Freedom plays on all violins.
Music comes from the White House.
And in front of Paris is Mickey Mouse.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
We're all living in America America, America We're all living in America Coca-Cola, Wanda Bra We're all living in America
I don't think my mother's gone No, this is not a love song We're all living in a mess
Thank you for watching!
All right, that was song number two in tonight's cage match.
That was Rammstein with America.
Very interesting.
And because I forgot to say it earlier, and I forgot we're going to have a lot of new listeners now with the whole DDR Freak Radio syndication, I should explain what the cage match is all about.
That's where we play three songs.
Each host picks a song.
They go head-to-head against each other, and the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio Live.
Orange Lounge Radio is the Monty Music and More program, which airs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week on Orange Lounge Radio.
Again, the cage match kind of started as songs that would be really good in DDR, 2DX, and Demonte-type games, but I think it just kind of turned into a clusterfuck of whatever's cool, as I was telling Pratt earlier.
Anyway, we're going to give our thoughts on those songs, but of course it is up to you in the end what you think.
You are the ones that have the final say, but we're going to give you a hint.
Jamie, you want to go first?
I hate that shit.
Do it.
Turn that shit off.
I'm turning the shift off.
I don't want my sticky keys to come on without, you know, actually anything being on there.
I don't want to hear about your sticky keys.
I don't get the keys sticky usually.
Anyway.
Something else.
Yeah, go ahead.
Mikey Style.
What, should I rate it?
Yes.
Definitely not one of the better Rammstein songs in my opinion, so I'm going to give it a 5.
Alright.
No, there's better songs than Dew Haas that they did.
Loki.
I liked it, it's, I have, you know, honestly, this album is not as good as the last album, the last album, every song fucking rocked, unfortunately, I don't have their last album ripped to my computer, so, I had to pick from this album, and, I like it, um, it's like this album had, like, a lot of, like, country named songs, so, I was torn between this one or Rush, uh, Moscow, so, uh, Moscow would have been pretty good.
And you don't hate Moscow nearly as much as you hate America, so you had to pick America.
Well, Moscow had a girl that sings in it, it's like Tattoo, and it's got also the... Sounds like Tattoo.
Yeah, and it also has accordion in the background that kind of goes with it.
It's weird, but it sounds good.
Clowock.
Um, I don't know, every time I hear, you know, all that kind of, you know, music, I think of, like, the German greats, you know, I think of Vanilla Ninja, I think of, uh, Falco, David Hasselhoff, you know, I mean, so, I have to, I have to accept my hierarchy.
Is Falco the guy that's, like, putting on the ritz?
No, that was Taco.
Oh, Taco.
Taco, Taco.
I have to set my hierarchy, and although that one was pretty interesting, I still think David Hasselhoff beats their ass.
I'll give it a 7.
I'll give it a 7.
I surprisingly like that song, which is rare for one of Loki's picks.
No, actually I did like that song, and I would probably give it an 8.
And going back to the cage match thing, I could see it in Guitar Freaks.
I think that would be a fun one to play.
Explicit.
Well, it's a pretty interesting song, but I've heard better songs from Rammstein, so I'm going to give it a 7 out of 10.
Alright, there you have it.
Alright, but it doesn't matter what we think, it's all up to what you guys think.
What's your favorite ODB quote?
I'm going to refrain from comments.
Be polite.
Alright, anyway.
Moving on.
He literally dropped dead.
At the age of 35 or 36.
He literally just dropped dead in the studio.
No, just like probably in a music studio, probably recording, which proves to us once again, cocaine is a hell of a drug.
You know he died with a 40 in his hand.
And still owing like six child support payments to his baby mama.
You know, he probably was dead like about 30 minutes before he actually fell to the floor.
You know, it's just the cracking and it was keeping him going.
Can I get to my song, please?
Comment, DarkSakura?
I just can't... don't feel very mournful over someone who didn't take responsibility for his children, so... I'm not the biggest fan either, but... We don't have a 40-ounce to tip in his honor, so we had to do something personal otherwise.
Urinate instead.
Anyway.
Moving on, my pick...
Whatcha Waitin' For?
Alright, and here it is.
Enjoy.
I think this song will be perfect for DDR.
You be the judge.
Here it is.
Song number three, Gwen Stefani, What You Waitin' For.
Enjoy.
What an amazing time, what a family How did the years go by, now it's only me
Thanks for watching!
Thank you for watching!
Thank you for watching!
Thank you for watching!
Watch now, you're still a supermodel female You've got your million dollar contract And they're all waiting for your luncheon What you waiting, what you waiting
I'm waiting for you.
I'm waiting for you.
I'm waiting for you.
All right, that was song number three in tonight's cage match.
Gwen Stefani, what you waiting for?
And I can tell you right now, we waiting for Jamie.
Oh, here she comes.
Jamie, I know you were gone for part of that.
What'd you think?
It's too happy.
It's a happy, too happy seven.
Yeah, it's a happy, shiny seven.
Happy, shiny seven.
All right, lanky seven.
Or is it shiny, happy seven?
There we go.
Anyway, um...
I like that song a lot.
I actually didn't hear that she was going solo until really recently, and then all of a sudden here's her song.
And I was kind of like, eh, not a big surprise the sound style she took.
It's kind of cliche, but it's still cool.
I like it.
It's dancey.
Good stuff.
On a scale of one to ten?
Oh, sorry.
I'd say probably an 8.5.
Loki!
Um, well, there's two things that that song was lacking.
Number one, well actually one thing that I didn't like about it, it was top 40.
Number two, it did not have any English in it.
There was no English in that song.
The other two songs featured English, that song had none, therefore it gets a six.
I like it.
I think it's kind of doubled on the fact that the video for it was actually very cool.
And ever since watching that video, I too would like to find a way to express how a giraffe does sound.
Because for those who haven't seen the video, she's trying to get inspiration, so she goes to some clinic or whatever.
They give her a survey, and one of the questions she has to answer is,
In your best way possible, write out what the sound of giraffe makes.
But I think it's a really bounce, definitely a pretty cool song.
It's very reminiscent of like I would say probably mid-80s production of Debbie Harry.
So I can totally get with that and this is one of those times where I do have to give out double digits, a 10 for me.
Wow.
I gotta say, you know what, that song just makes me want to shake my booty and spank yours.
Give it a five.
I give it a nine and a half.
Exquisite.
I really like the song.
I like how Gwen Stefani went to the direction that has more of like an 80s type of background.
But at the same time, I don't know, maybe I'm just not used to her music for that type of direction.
So I probably gave it a... That's a pretty good song, so I gave it an 8.5.
Might as well because of what Sky said about speaking his ass.
So 7.5 for real.
Alright, well good thing it's not up to these guys.

Loki, tell us what's going on in the sim scene this week.
Nada.
Um...
I think I mentioned it last week, it was a release candidate to Step Mania came out and other than that there's really the only thing that's worth mentioning is there's a contest, a theme contest that's going on with all the themes that have been made this year they're trying to get DDR Maniacs' theme of 2004 with many in the running like Techno Fiend which is in the lead and
Some other ones that are on there.
Yeah, Technofiend.
Anyways, Technolize, Technofiend, I can't remember what it's called.
So yeah, those are worth checking out.
I know...
Technolize is working on version 3.0, which is supposed to be completely redone.
It's still nice looking.
Other than that, really not too much going on right now.
I've been checking out this week, actually, BMS sim files.
For those who don't know what those are, those are the homemade, key-sounded Beatmania 2DX.
I will rock you
It was really cool, actually.
Very cool.
They turned it into a house song, which was pretty neat.
And then I have a remix of The Fall that's on there, and there's also Paranoia Delta, but that one's too much noise.
It's like too grungy, so...
Not worth playing on the show.
But you can find those.
There's sim files out there for them.
Also one that was pointed out that I found would be Cigaru 180, which was by this... The only Russian Bimani remixer that I've seen.
It's actually pretty cool.
We might be able to play that later.
But those are pretty much... That's all that's really going on.
How long is it?
It's only like a minute fifty, right?
All right.
Again, if you enjoy Bomani remixes, then might I urge you to tune in to Diversion, the Orange Launch Radio remix show, which airs every Monday night at 7 o'clock Pacific Standard Time on our station.
Check it out.
And, of course, this week will be the first question in that show for the Akira Yamaoka signed CD contest.
If you're just joining us, check out our website, www.orangenlaunchradio.com, for all the details.
Okay, here it is.
Loki's going to spin this for us.
What's this remix called again?
It's...
It's Cigaroo180, and the guy that remixed it's name is Vospy.
And he's got his own site, I really have to search hard to find it.
He's a member on DDRUK, he does a lot of stuff with the Pump It Up scene over there, I guess.
But, yeah, Cigaroo180, and it's only about a little over two minutes.
So, here we go.
Alright, check this out.
Thank you for watching!
Is that it?
Wow, alright, that's it.
That was pretty neat.
That was pretty cool.
Where can people get a copy of that if they want?
Um, but my style in their sim file section is like, you can just do a search for Cigarro180 and you can find that sim file for it, which isn't that bad actually, I played it last night.
Just, I'm out of practice and my hand cramped up pretty quick.
Alright.
So, I missed me and your, uh, getting, you know, some action then, because you haven't been, uh, taking care of yourself.
If your hand, you're not... My wrist is fine, it's my hand that's not.
He said his wrist is fine, it's his hand that's not.
Anyway.
I see.
Alright, let's get to the winner of tonight's cage match, shall we?
We took some votes while that song was on.
You guys ready to hear tonight's winner?
What do you guys think won?
I always pull.
I would say the third song definitely won.
Well, let's see if it was a shocker tonight.
Tonight's winner was not a shocker.
Alright.
It was close, though.
The votes were very... ...the worst piece of shit I can find next week.
Hey, sing the song.
And I remind you, you just had a song retired.
It's time to let Jamie and I bounce some back and forth for a little while, so... Alright.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
It's Guitar Freaks and Dromania V. V standing for Vest.
That still doesn't make any sense, though.
But what the theme is going to be for this release is going to be gears and machinery.
So you're going to see some pretty kick-ass interfaces, at least.
They're revamping, I guess, the result screen.
It's supposed to be more 3D or something like that.
God knows what they're going to do with that.
The movies that are going to be playing during it, it's going to be something similar to 2DX, where you're going to see full motion video and stuff like that.
That means a hardware upgrade.
It's going to be a hardware upgrade, yes.
It's going to be just like 2DX, 10th Style, and Red.
It's going to be right off of a PC-like hardware system.
The other thing that they were saying it was supposed to be in there is about 230 songs starting, I think.
And that's not including, I think, the unlocks from, you know, obviously the emu stuff.
Other than that, really not much else other than they mentioned a few songs for test locations.
I know that were on there and some licensed stuff.
One song that's being pointed out in our chat room specifically by DarkLionXVI says...
Mysterilou, which was the theme from Pulp Fiction.
Actually, I think I know who this is that's calling.
Actually, hold on, let me take this.
Keep telling us about Guitar Restart Mania.
Why don't we have a cage match one week with ringtones?
Anyways, this is a game where you play the guitar and beat the drums.
So, how's that?
I was going to look on the list here and see what we've got for Guitar Freaks.
Some new Dezbro songs.
We've got Endless Cruising, which sounds pretty cool.
Mushroom Boy by Pooh.
Everyone loves Pooh.
And Going Up by Colors.
I just want to say it's awesome that there's a band called Pooh in Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania.
What song are you going to play?
Pooh?
And as we were mentioning before, Mizorilou or whatever that is Mizorilou is Spaghetti Surfers Wild Challenger by Jindo NGS by Asian Kung Fu Generation Nocturne No.
9 sounds like, you know, No.
9 But by some Japanese group here And the extra stage will be Heaven's Cocktail By Big Five
and... Heaven's Cocktail.
Did you get one of those cool little umbrella things with it too?
Maybe.
But anyway, so yeah, that's kind of what's going on.
Link to the Konami test page or whatever on OrangeLawsRadio.com.
So if you can read Japanese, you'll definitely get a kick out of this site.
Also, pictures are on the page.
Oh, okay, cool.
I also can't remember if we linked to this or not.
I actually don't think I ran a story on it.
I'm going to have to tomorrow.
I did pick wind, though, that Konami is doing another survey.
Remember how they did a big survey?
They were putting their feelers out there for a 2DX7 style?
Well, this time the game they're taking surveys for, Karaoke Revolution, Bamani Edition.
In Japan, they are putting out the feelers right now for a karaoke revolution edition with all Bomani songs in it.
Wouldn't that be something else?
It'd just be like watching DDR3rd Mix all over again.
Seriously, that's basically what it is.
More info on that to follow.
We don't know a whole lot about that right now.
All we know is that I think they were looking for 3,000, which isn't a very big number.
So, it looks like that'll probably happen, the Karaoke Revolution Bomani Edition.
And for some people, it'll finally be an excuse for them to play.
And maybe those kids that were trying to get Murmur Twins in Karaoke Revolution will finally get their way.
Which would be very interesting, I think, if Murmur Twins made it in there.
We'll have to see.
They need to put this in here.
What was that?
Naha and Gachikun.
That'd be great.
Yeah, so there's not too much going on.
We're still waiting to hear more about Dancing Stage Fusion, the arcade mix, because that's going to be the huge news to come out.
Because, you know, if Europe's doing it, then, well, guess what?
The hardware's done, so all they've got to do is make the game.
or another game for another region, you know, Japan.
I'm surprised that we're not seeing a new arcade mix for Japan, because, I mean, it's not that hard to make it once the hardware's done or whatever, but, you know, hey, whatever.
So, it'll be interesting.
At least, maybe we'll see some arcades import that over here, because they'll get desperate and not wanting to wait any longer and not wanting to buy in the groove, so, yeah.
More than desperate to lose an XP+,
is saying something about DanceHouse Extreme Plus.
That's really in town now?
Yes, it's CCL.
Oh, God.
Yeah, DDR Extreme Plus, or the so-called Knicks that they claim is new, it's actually on CCL, Country Club Lanes.
Interesting, our local bowling alley, where DDR was born here in Sacramento.
Very interesting.
I kind of want to check that out.
You know what's very cool about Country Club Lanes here in Sacramento, our bowling alley where DDR was born here in this area?
It's 24 hours, which makes it very cool for DDR, because it's open 24 hours.
Yeah, but there still is a night you have to pay the cover charge to get in.
That's very true, that's very true, and that sucks.
I remember, I mean, back in the day, we used to hang out, like, till midnight and go play DDR till 3 in the morning.
I remember the days of glow bowling.
I remember the days when we would go... We need to do that.
We seriously need to go glow bowling.
Remember back in the day, right when Rocky Horror first died and the sacramentals were coming together?
I remember you, you and me, and Mel and Melody all went.
Yes, I do remember that quite vividly.
And we were like, duh, tired.
I remember going and we'd go and then we'd play DDR and that was back when they still had, I think, a 1.5 mix.
I seem to recall that... I remember being assaulted on the 1.5 machine.
Yeah.
Oh, that's fun.
Good time.
I think when we went it was actually up to a fifth mix at the time.
Yeah.
Ugh.
I believe in good service, thank you.
Good memories there.
Any location that has 24-hour DDR is fun.
Any place now is completely at my mercy now that I've got my business law book.
Because now I could have sued them for not fulfilling their duty of utmost care.
Don't mess with her.
She's got a law book now.
Damn.
So very interesting, though, going back to the fact that Dancing Stage Fusion is going to be having a brand new cabinet coming out.
Could be very good sign for DDR.
Could be just a red herring.
Who knows?
Well, you never know.
I mean, also, you've got to think of it like this.
When they did DDR Extreme, they even mentioned as much, like in concert, I believe, they said they had to take a break from DDR because, you know, for whatever reason.
And it was at the point where they had created a DDR mix like once a year, practically, and
I think we got like 4th and 5th mix in the same year.
Oh yeah, you had 4th and then you had 4th Plus come out and then 5th.
Yeah, that's right.
It was like 4th, 4th Plus, and then like 5th and Max came out in the same year, I think.
Yeah, so I think it was long overdue, at least just for a little time off.
So it wouldn't surprise me the least bit to see a new DDR come out.
I mean...
Yeah, that's just how it works.
Seeing how 2DX and Guitar Freaks Drum Mania have been cranking out babies and all that kind of stuff I think it's a good thing that Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania is getting an overhaul though Because honestly, it was getting to a point when they got, like what are they on, like 11th mix now?
I just, yeah, it's been the same damn game since 5th mix, just with different songs It's kind of got to the point where it's like, oh, Guitar Freaks is getting a new mix, oh, you know, must be Monday You know, it's like
DDR1?
Oh, DDR Hawaii?
Well, usually...
Usually, I'm not sure about arcade mixes, because as far as, I mean, as far as, like, say, home console versions, like KSET, I believe, does, like, there's actually, the AM division is different than the console division.
So, I mean, as far as, like, programming, all that kind of stuff, Hawaii doesn't really have that much say, I don't think, as far as arcade releases.
As far as, like, home version, of course, they got the lockdown on that.
Interesting.
Well, it'll be interesting to see what happens.
Because a lot of people, just with the developments with Ultramix 2 and the license, they said, you know, I've heard people say this, if DDR comes out again in the USA, Hawaii needs to be involved.
Hawaii definitely needs to be involved.
Which is amazing, considering that Ultramix 2 hasn't even come out yet.
But, we'll see.
Yeah, it's, I mean, there's a lot of things going into Ultramix 2 that are different.
You know, obviously, some people give Hawaii credit for
And of course going kind of a slightly different direction.
Some people can point out to the fact that this time they got even more DDR knowledgeable people to QA and not only that work on step data.
So this is very much like fans having even more, or like players having more of a say into what goes into a game.
If that's the direction how DDR as far as the Ultra Mix franchise is concerned, then it's definitely going to have its own identity very shortly.
People will see that as soon as they get it.
Very good.
All right.
I guess we're going to do now.
I think now is a good time to take a break.
And when we come back, we're going to get into the FUs of the week.
So if you want to send some FUs in over private message to Sky in the chat room, we will make sure we get those read on air for you.
We're going to continue to play some full-length versions that we found on the Internet of brand-new Ultramix 2 songs.
And this one should take you back.
This is one I did not recognize until I actually listened to it.
I did not recognize it by the name.
But then when I started listening to it, I'm like...
Oh my god, this song!
This is Don't Stop by the Freestylers.
Enjoy this.
This is going to be an ultra mix too.
Enjoy.
We'll be back.

Those of you guys that are new to the program are going to hear this every week.
The FUs of the week.
And Jamie, why is it that we have to do these FUs of the week every single week?
Because we're not going to take it anymore.
The first F you goes to my allergies for flaring up.
The second goes to Benadryl for making me sleepy.
Also, for some reason, my jaw hurts.
Like, the joints in my jaws.
Yeah, I've got all this sinus pressure in my head.
That means that I'm likely going to bed early.
I don't drink tariff, nor do I have any at the house.
I have prescription drugs that are doing shit.
Oof.
But I'm probably going to be going to sleep early tonight.
A big F you toward having to work on this ethics project.
F you to the sneezes that don't happen.
F you to stupid people in traffic.
F you to the doctor who put my arm in a cast.
I cut that shit off of branch cutters.
My hand still hurts.
Yeah, another F you to my cat, Shermie, for being in a big feeding frenzy so that I'd trip over her while wearing socks in the kitchen.
Last Sunday.
Just, in general, just massive F yous to just about everything.
I think that will cover everything.
Alright.
Loki, your turn.
Oh, my God.
You know, as if I don't complain about them enough.
Yay!
You did it again, Comcast!
You just find a way to fuck everything up again!
Way to go, G4!
Because you know what?
There wasn't quite enough crap on there yet, so you had to get rid of the, like, good stuff, you know, to fit more crap in there.
I'm sorry for all those people that used to be part of TechTV that got sucked into G4 and then fired, because you're talented.
Well, you know what?
They don't want to make G4 look bad, so guess what?
Bye-bye!
Bye-bye, screensavers!
Bye-bye, Unscrewed!
Yeah, screensavers will still be there, but it ain't screensavers anymore.
And, you know what?
I'm... And you know what sucks, too?
Is I heard that the people... Actually, some of the good shows on G4, like Cheat and stuff... Oh, those guys got fired, too!
So, guess what?
You know, the hell with all the good stuff on G4!
I will not be watching G4 anymore unless to catch the last episode of Unscrewed, if they ever air it...
Thank you Loki for destroying any possible opportunity we ever had of taking Orange Lounge TV on the air.
Thank you.
Listen.
Listen, I'm not going to want to be associated with anything on that station because, uh, you know, it just does not have enough halo in that show.
So, um, no.
Anyways, um, so fuck them.
And, um, fuck...
My headache, because it sucks, but it's starting to go away, so that's kind of good.
Fuck Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.
And more specifically, the Woozimo mission.
I can't fucking beat it!
It's annoying!
Why does anyone... Okay, why do street racers, Japanese street racers, come to town to have an off-road street race?
I'm sorry, but, you know, people that drive, you know, those racers, don't drive off-road, okay?
The racers were not made for off-road, so... Why do they have a race that goes off-road?
That sucks.
And, um, finally... Fuck you again, the G4, because you suck!
I hate you!
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you!
That's it.
I just want to give a special message to Comcast.
You know what?
Despite what Loki says, I will still sell out faster than Divine Brown, okay?
I just want you to know...
and I have this great concept.
I have this wonderful concept for a gay gaming show.
We could call it Gamers.
Think about it.
Think about it.
You want me.
You know you do.
I would take Jamie with me.
Loki gets left behind, though, after that remark.
Does that mean that you have to have the hag co-host?
Yes, you would be my official fag hag co-host.
Cool.
All right.
And Loki can polish my shoes for all I care.
All right.
Anyway, on to my FUs, my actual FUs of the week.
You can be the angry hetero guy in the corner.
Yeah.
My FUs go to being sick, because I've been very sick all weekend, and it sucks, because remember I was sitting here last week, and I took a poll how many people were sick, and half the people were sick, and I said, gee, the rest of us feel like we just got a death sentence, like we're waiting to get sick.
Sure enough, I got sick.
It wasn't quite as bad, like I think the strain kind of got weaker as it went along, so I can't bitch too much.
But being sick still sucks.
I just want to get that out there.
But what I really want to say on FU2 is FU to those guys on Halo 2.
Oh my god!
I got invited into this match on Xbox Live.
One of my friends, somebody on my friends list on Xbox.
You know how like the people on your friends list, you sometimes don't know them that well?
Well, I had one of these guys.
Then he invited me into his game and he had like all these experts in there.
And I guess they were having tryouts for their clan.
And for some reason they wanted me to try out for their clan.
Well, like, we were playing one of those team games that was King of the Hill, and I'd never played that version before, so I didn't know what I was doing.
And my teammates were yelling at me, and they were like, Don't you know what you're doing?
Come on, Green Sky, what the hell's wrong with you?
And I'm just like, I wanted to cry.
Like, I was just like, they're yelling at me, and they're being mean to me.
I don't know what I'm doing.
Fuck your clan!
You guys are the Ku Klux Klan right now!
That's what you guys are!
Rob.
What?
You need to join the clan that Dan's in, the fuckers.
Okay, I'll join that.
Are they going to yell at me if I screw up?
Probably not.
Probably half of them will be drunk.
After that match, though, Flairone, one of our listeners, invited me into one of his matches, and I blew him up a bunch with a rocket, and that made me feel better.
So thank you, Flairone, for letting me take my aggressions out on you.
That's it.
F you to assholes on Halo 2, and F you to people on Xbox Live that when you sign on to the game, they go...
Yeah, because they think it makes them look cool.
FYI, it doesn't.
Grow up.
Thank you.
Moving on, let's see what our other guests in the studio have to say, starting with Floatwalk.
Oh, sorry, we can't hear you.
Turn on the mic.
Oh damn, I had no idea.
Sorry about that.
Okay, well, it's a pretty tame week of FU's for me, although part of one right now I'm just thinking more than anything is FU to Konami Digital Entertainment America QA department.
Thanks for laying me off a lot earlier before the game even passed, you know.
I mean, I'll probably get help for even saying it, but there are some things you don't do.
You don't spit in the wind, you don't tug on Superman's cape, and you don't break up a team before the game goes gold.
I'll leave it at that.
And I think Mr. Miklatov can totally get me off, can back me up on that one.
So, yes, I'll leave it very short like that before I really go off.
Well, I think we'll just move right along to Exquisite.
One of the biggest FUs.
Okay, six inches from now.
All right.
Try again.
Okay, okay.
Is this better right here?
Yes, much better.
Alright, I'd like to say a big F you to some old guy who rear-ended my fucking car!
Oh wow!
You rear-ended my car!
What the hell?
Jamie's trying to nap.
You gotta turn it down a notch, that's alright.
I'm sorry for being so loud, but I was just very pissed off with the fuckin' old fart who fuckin' really entered my car, and it was his fault for moving back.
I moved out first, so it gives me priority to go first.
And the fact he just went, like, around 20 miles an hour backing up?
Just cause you drive an SUV does not mean shit.
There was no scratches in your car, yet you left a big ass dent in my Toyota Corolla 2004 S Silver.
Now it looks all ugly as hell and I have to pay 200 bucks.
Now I have to pay 200 bucks off my own money just to get that shit fixed.
And just cause you said, oh, I'm sorry, and run away like it's a hidden run with a bunch of cops around doesn't mean I'm gonna...
I'm on your ass whenever I see you!
Okay, enough with the FUs with the car, because I'll pay that shit up in a few weeks and stuff.
Okay, another FU goes to people playing Halo 2 multiplayer.
Hey!
No, certain people, certain people.
All right.
Just because you're touching my balls doesn't mean I'm distracted.
Wow, wow, what, what, what?
Wait, wait, I didn't realize this was a feature in Halo 2.
Wait, whoa, wait a minute, wait a minute.
Yeah, we see people try to cheat in Halo 2.
So you know what people do in Halo 2?
Like, if you have to put people around, like, what?
Sorry.
Oh.
Sorry, sorry, we're doing something else over here.
Funny picture on a website.
Ooh, interesting.
But yeah, F you to people who are trying to cheat in Halo 2.
Yeah, punching people in the face.
Just try to win a game.
It's just a DM game, yo.
If you get your ass kicked, just take the heat.
There's no need to touch people, just touch people, touch people in the balls for a subsexual desire that you guys have.
And no, I'm not like that, so.
If it was a female, that'd be cool.
Okay, well, speaking of females, I'd like to say another F you to this one stripper who fucking knee dropped my... Yeah, she, yeah, during, uh, during Gold Club 34, I paid 20 bucks for, uh, for a few lap dances.
It was discounted too, by the way, so I get four.
Yeah, well, it was a cool rap test and all, but the fact that she acted like a knee drop, like, oops!
This is what you get when we're looking at funny pictures of Sephiroth killing Aerith.
We're going to put it up on the TV so you guys can see it.
I just posted it in the chat room.
Somebody made a signature on the G4 Tech TV forum.
It's Sephiroth, and he has a G4 logo where his face should be, and there's an Aerith with a Tech TV logo where her face should be, and it's the scene where Sephiroth is about to kill her.
Yeah, I think the only thing about the stripper kneeing you in the like gonads for the lapdance, I think she noticed that, you know, if you're trying to get lapdances on a discount, she's gonna be a little miffed too, man.
Alright.
Well, I gotta bend the nuts from the situation.
Alright, it's a three hour show.
Can I move on now?
Well, it's a fact that she has a male name.
Her name's Bradley...
DJ Tyrant says, F you to school, not enough time in the day, not having a car license and life going a little too fast for me, I don't want to grow up P.S.
Tell Mel B I said, I heart him
Aw, I heart the tyrants too.
Aw, I know you're trying to suck up to me because you won't pass into E3 next year.
Don't worry, I got you covered like a Jimmy hat.
Fucking fanboys.
Just kidding.
Actually, if Mel can get me into E3 again, I'll be all up on him just like a fanboy.
Not like up on him, but you know.
I know, kind of like when you call me a brother, you know, not the way like we mean in a biological sense, but the way black people talk to each other.
Anyway, DarkLionXVI says, F you to annoying tourists who keep on bugging players just for them to look stupid.
Last night at the Adventure Dome, I had to move a black guy off the Player 2 DER pad because he was distracting a friend of mine while playing The Legend of Max's Extra Stage.
F you to myself for going to a debut party last week, ending up doing nothing at all.
Legend of Zaku says, F you to my little brother for running up almost $30 in overages at the wireless bill this month.
F you to Leisure Time Bowling Alley and Port Authority Bus Terminal in New York City for being assholes by trashing their in the groove for a second extreme machine.
Yay, score one for the good guys.
Dark Tetsuya says, F you to, surprise, surprise, Comcast for taking a giant crap on G4 Tech TV.
DD Arcaholic says, F you to people who think that they're hot guys in video games.
I may not play a lot of video games myself, but I'm pretty sure there are no hot guys in them.
Big ol' sweaty rowdy roadie Piper is not a hot guy.
He does not make me moist with his chest pounding, nor does his ugly Cro-Magnum man head or his butt crack, which is pinched shut due to the vice grip power of his gluteus maxi, make my nipples hard.
Antonio Banderas is a hot, hot guy.
He is not in video games.
No, Montier.
and FU if you think that complaining about the lack of hot guys in the media is a sad pursuit because your continuous excitement of bouncing boobies is itself a sad pursuit.
So there, suck my titty.
Holla.
Wow.
Iguana Girl says, a lovely FU to idiots who think they can talk their way out of warning points for flame baits.
They're coming to get you.
Failed.
Dark Knight has won FU tonight, and that's to torment I'm going to be facing at work here from on out.
Note, I work for a retail store, need I say more.
He works at a retail store, therefore this is not going to be a happy, fun time of year for him.
MPQ says FU to Halo 2 for making it almost impossible to get an Xbox.
and Misty says, fuck me for sleeping until 6 central and having to get to work at 5.
I doubt I'll be getting any sleep tonight.
That's it for our chatroom FUs.
Woo!
Alright.
Very colorful FUs from all you guys.
Thank you.
All right, all right.
What we're going to do now is we're going to go to break.
In this break, we're going to hear another brand new long version of an Ultramix 2 song.
I think this time we're going to do a group that's already been announced, actually.
You already kind of knew they were in Ultramix 2 with a song called C Squared because it was on the VRare.
But they have another song in DDR Ultramix as well that was announced on the website, and it's called Mellow.
And the group is Alien No. 613.
and so on.
Miklatov says, F you to Halo 2 for not saving my damn progress.
Now I have to play this fucking level again.
Boo on you, Halo 2.
F you to people who don't realize Drawn Together is one of the hottest shows ever.
It sounds like a horrible idea for a show, and it is, but it's the best thing on Comedy Central since Strangers with Candy.
I love you, Xander.
Alright.
Sorry, Mikotov, I just, your window for some reason didn't show up as red.
It's because you were sending me other messages earlier, that's why.
Anyway, let's get to the break.
Alright, as I promised, Alien number 613 and the song is called Mellow.
Enjoy.
Hello?
Hello, is this thing on?
Testing.
Testing, one, two.
I'm looking in the index, but I don't see anything for how to run a radio show.
Hello?
I don't understand this.
Does this thing work?
This thing reads like stereo instructions.
Is this on?
What the hell?
Orange Lounge Radio.
Broke Down Ghetto Bomani Radio.
What?
Ask Orange Lounge
There you go.
And also, we'll open up the Skype line for you guys if you have anything you want to comment on over the Skype line because I know we haven't gotten to talk to all you guys yet tonight.
Again, if you want more information on the Skype line, visit www.orangelongeradio.com and click on Interact With Us.
Yes, Loki?
I would like to take this moment to talk about the wonderful show called Drawn Together.
I watched today the first two episodes twice.
And I have to say, it's the fucking, it is on par, if not better, than The Family Guy.
And that was way up there.
Okay, hold on, we're getting a call.
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn Radio.
Hi.
Hello.
Turn down the speaker volume in your house.
Hello?
Hi, we can barely hear you, but we can hear ourselves.
Echoing, turn down your...
I was wondering if you could get Pop Music 5 into rotation I like the music in Pop Music 5 I didn't hear any
I'm not sure the exact titles, I think Tempura Brothers, Siciliana, they're Japanese titles, but it's in there somewhere.
You know what I'll do?
I will have our resident poppin' music whore, Navi, take a look at the soundtrack and tell me what I need to add, and we'll put some tracks in rotation, just for you, my friend.
Thanks, that's cool.
No problem.
Anything else you want to comment on?
Not really.
Are you liking the Bomani Music and More program otherwise?
Yeah, I like Bomani music.
Shit, if you want to talk about a game that hasn't changed since day one, poppin' music, holy crap!
Why is that game so popular?
That's what I want to know.
Ah, buttons!
I hit the buttons!
Fun!
Japanese music!
Cool!
I mean, it's just, no, that game does not appeal to me at all.
It's like 2DX for retards, I mean.
It's just the big buttons.
But, you know, hey, I guess there's a demographic out there for, you know, retarded 2DX players, so...
Hey, if you want to play, it's like playing 2DX with boxing gloves, you know, if you want to do that, so be it.
I mean, it's cool, it's cool because it gets crazy and stuff, but, you know, they just really haven't changed anything with that game.
They have not changed much.
But here I am, the uninformed pop music person, because I don't play pop music, and I tried playing pop music and it just did not appeal to me, but for some reason I'm still putting pop music in my cabinet, so...
I'm giving another go later.
You take the good, you take the bad.
Yeah, whatever.
Anyway.
You take them both and there you have the facts alive.
The facts alive.
Whatever happened to that Simphile contest we were going to do like a while back on the show?
Remember we were going to have the Orange Lounge Radio response to Simphile contest and we were going to have the all TV show Simphile theme?
Yeah, I know.
They can do turn-a-mix.
Shit, I mean, we could give away signed Ikiriyamaoka CDs, for God's sakes.
People would enter for that.
The DVDs in my room.
I know, seriously, we need to have more contests.
I still have like 30 Max 2 viewers at my place if anyone wants them.
Let's just start giving away like candy, hey.
Dude, that's like all we do at like DDR sponsored tournaments.
It's where it's all about speed loud.
There you go.
All right.
We'll be a walking boot.
All right, let's get into a favorite segment here on this program, which we haven't done in quite some time.
Are you sticking with us for a walk?
Yeah, what the hell, I'll stay here until the end.
All right, that's a real trooper there.
Yeah, you know, hell, sleep's overrated, I guess.
Yeah, that's right.
All right, here we go.
Yeah, that's only 15 more minutes.
Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.
What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?
Since it's been a few weeks, since we've had a segment, I expect there to be lots of questions or else... Alright.
Here's a real winner.
This question's from Legend of Zaku.
I love this question.
This is why I miss the Ask Orange Lounge segment.
Because remember, you can ask us about Bomani, you can ask us about whatever the hell you want, and this definitely falls into the latter.
Legend of Zaku says, Being a person of Hispanic descent, how come white girls like and have a thing for Hispanic guys?
Dude, ask Eddie Guerrero from the WWE.
It's all about Latino Heat!
Jamie just burst into the room from where she was.
This is all of us do.
Hey man, you want to see my Aztec Warrior?
Gotta love next Friday.
That has to be one of the most retarded questions I've ever heard in my life.
That is so generalized.
I personally... Maybe in his neck of the woods, but... In general, I'm sorry, no offense, I mean, I've dated a few Hispanic guys, but most in general, I've not had very good experiences with.
I have a lot of friends.
I've dated a few guys, but in general, I haven't had a very good experience in a romantic relationship with Hispanic men.
I dated a Hispanic guy once.
It was a nice date.
Son of a bitch never called me back, but it was a nice date.
And I think probably the fact that I have a Hispanic last name, you know, I too wonder why all the white chicks dig me too.
I can't answer this question without sounding like a racist.
Let's move on to the second question then.
Um, let's see, Jazz.
Well, this is a good question.
Have any of you guys played Technic Beat?
And if so, what do you think of it?
This is a brand new game that came out from, I believe, Namco did it, and it's another one of their bargain basement games, like Katamari Damashii, and I've heard a lot of great things about it, but I've been too ghetto poor to pay it.
I've seen pictures...
But I haven't played it.
I've seen pictures, it looks interesting, but I haven't played it.
I've heard very, very good things about it.
Isn't it something about like Ripples or something?
Yeah, it's on my to-do list because it is, you know, we want to cover all the popular music.
We still need to get the game where you do the alien that annoys people.
I know, the Under the Skin.
Under the Skin.
But that has nothing to do with Technic Beat.
I know.
Quick change in the subject, Tommy.
Alright, but yeah, Technic Beat, I'm looking forward to it.
I've heard a lot of great things about it.
Unfortunately, I have not had a chance to play it yet.
I haven't seen it anywhere, strangely enough.
I didn't even realize it was out until I went onto a website.
I was looking for Under the Skin the last time I was at the mall.
Nothing.
Alright.
Technic Beat.
We will check it out as soon as we can.
Don't we still need to get Karaoke Revolution 3?
Yes, we do.
Thank you for reminding me.
I want to invite Iguana Girl back on the show so we can do our duet to Love Shack live on air on Karaoke Revolution 3.
I hope she'll be down for it.
And then we're going to make you sing.
So very ronery.
All right.
DD Archaholic says, when you guys are not playing Bomani games, what other toys do you like?
Mine come from a store called Goldies, which is located on 16th, never mind, I'm kidding.
I don't know, I don't have any toys in the living room that might be playing video or anything like that.
I have my computer.
I have my computer, my turntables, my cabinet, my game systems.
My portal to hell device.
I don't need toys, I have a man I can climb all over.
That has been a journey into the TMI zone.
What about you, FlowWalk?
What do you do when you're not playing Mamani?
Besides recovering from eye strain afterwards.
What other toys?
Well, gosh.
Let's see.
I got my... I play with poker chips all the time because obviously I play a bunch of Hold'em on the side and stuff like that.
I got my car, which is, you know, still my toy.
I still think of it that way.
I mean, you would too if you won it.
And...
and, of course, Yu-Gi-Oh!
cards, which I toss around nowadays.
That's really about it.
I'm kind of outgoing to toy things.
Except I still play with bobbleheads.
Do you miss Kyle Snyder as a worthy opponent at Yu-Gi-Oh?
Oh my god totally where else would you get like a totally great duel along with color commentary on the side I mean it's like straight up walking to like the cartoon and it is it's you are not playing Yu-Gi-Oh you are like you're in the mini production of a movie it's like you can make a music video out of just us two going at it it is so awesome I would have loved to have seen a Yu-Gi-Oh Tatooine video
I don't have anything, I already talked about my toys
All right.
We have another question for Ask Orange Lounge from Chance.
And Chance is asking, when are you going to update the chat server info on the website?
Zing!
I didn't know it was wrong.
I actually did not know it was wrong.
I will look into that.
Thank you for bringing that to my attention.
Yikes!
I thought it worked just fine.
I've still been using the Java chat.
Maybe you know what it is.
I think it's because one of the other side IRC things went down.
I will look into that.
My bad.
And Jazz, okay, his second question to us is, why are boobs?
That's the question.
Why are boobs?
Spelled B-E-W-B-S.
Boobs.
Boobs.
Boobs.
Why are boobs?
Why not?
Lovely.
Because if milk came out their ass, that'd be weird.
I mean, they're what make the world go around.
I mean, think about it.
When you were a kid and you were crying, what did mom do?
She shoved one of them in your mouth.
Women out there, just understand, if you ever want to make us shut up, shove one in our mouth, man.
Wow, okay.
Women.
Boo.
What, Jamie?
I don't know how far I want to go with this question because I don't know if I want to bring up politics on this program.
If you want to argue politics, go to random chat on DDR Freak.
There's tons of politics threads there.
Who did you vote for on election day?
Honestly, if you listen to the show enough, you know.
You know that Jamie voted for Bill the Cat.
You know that I voted for Carrie.
All the candidates were pieces of flaming shit.
And not flaming in a good way.
I mean flaming as in on fire so they're extra stinky.
So, you know, if I voted, it would probably have been like I would have voted for Kerry, but the election machine would have seen that I was actually intoxicated or out of my mind and would have voted Bush for me, so...
Now, let me take a poll here.
Who did vote on election day?
No matter who you voted for, you did vote.
I didn't!
Looks like me and TripleExplicit did.
Everybody here but Loki went and voted on election day, so that's something.
I mean, usually on a typical election year, there wouldn't be this many people voting.
So, I think that says enough right there.
At least, you know, everybody voted.
Well, you know, a lot more people than usual voted, which is good.
And my take on voting has always been...
If you're gonna, like, complain about stuff, at least be proactive one way or another.
It doesn't matter how you vote.
As long as you do it, hey, you know, you have a say.
That's why sometimes people say, oh, yeah, man, I hate what's going on, all this kind of stuff, but I'm not gonna vote.
But how the fuck are you gonna, you know, change things?
You know, I mean, I don't care how you vote.
I mean, not everyone's gonna see eye to eye.
If you think the government should always be one certain party or the other, I mean, you're no different than Osama.
You know, if you think the government should be run one way only, then...
Yeah, you know, that's not a cool thing.
I think, yeah, you gotta mix it up once in a while, and that's why we have different parties.
And for those, I mean, I know Jamie goes off about, like, there's more than two parties.
I think what people aren't getting is, it's like, you can't make change from the top down.
You kinda gotta start from the bottom up.
I mean, if an independent party can't, like, win, like, a senator job sometimes, I mean, how the hell is it gonna be president?
You know, it's just...
I don't say it can't happen or shouldn't happen, but I think they've just got to aim a little smaller first before they, you know, go for the big prize.
I still am for disabling the electoral college and getting rid of the party system altogether.
I am all for, and you might hear me complain about this later, I am all for disabling electronic voting.
Paperless voting is very bad.
Everyone votes on paper.
Yes, I totally agree with that.
Okay, it's Ask Orange Lounge.
We got on elect... Electronic voting offers more of a chance that the vote is either not going to be counted, altered.
It has a lot more inconsistency.
That's why voting... I did a write-in absentee.
Even though at the polls they had the floating and hanging Chad problem this year just like they did back last election, so why?
Well, I think the way they need to do it is, honestly, I love the way they do it in Sacramento County.
You have a mix of electronic and paper.
You fill in the bubble and then you scan it, and that way you scan it, and if there's a dispute with the way they're scanned, you have a paper trail.
I think it's the perfect way to do it, personally.
Absolutely.
Oh, okay, I thought you meant, like, okay, never mind.
Yeah, I'm totally fine with Scantron voting, I just do not like electronic voting with no paper trail.
And for all those kids out there, you know what's really fun to do, a Scantron test?
There's this little bubble in the top of the test marquee, and if you scan that in, guess what?
You're the answers!
It really fucks up all the tests.
Anyway, off the politics subject, I want to wrap up the last few questions here so we can close this segment.
Dark Knight has a weird one here.
This might be a sad question, but this is all I have.
Which trading card game slash cartoon crossover is the worst?
That's if you've seen any of them.
If you don't want to answer, don't.
All of them.
All of them suck.
All of them, says Loki.
All of them suck.
I don't know.
Kind of hard to say.
I mean, everyone, I mean, I'm personally not even that big a fan of Pokemon, really, but I think it's funny because, no, I mean, it's kind of cool, but, I mean, if I had to pick one, but...
Funny thing, because I think of, like, cartoons and crossovers into TCGs, I heard a rumor from, like, Upper Deck, who does, like, the Marvel Versus series, like, soon they're supposed to be releasing one with, like, the Justice League, so you could have, like, Superman, Batman, the Wonder Twins and all that stuff, versus, like, Brainiac, Mitzelplick and all that, I mean, would that not be just the coolest idea ever?
That would be a cool video game.
Card game, no.
Eh.
Of course, man.
And Aquaman ain't gonna drown in no tub.
All right, all right.
One more.
Duel Masters is pretty ass.
One more question here, then we've got to wrap it up.
Last question from... Duel Masters suck.
Oh, last question from DarkTetsuya.
He sent me a song to put in Cage Match this week, and he says, you didn't use my song.
Is it because I put it in the wrong format?
No, it's just because I really wanted to put that other song in.
Your song is in my queue.
It'll come up eventually.
Don't worry.
So...
No worries.
If you have suggestions, you can always send us an email, one of the hosts an email, and we'll get your song and cage match if we like it.
And I do like his picks, so I'll get in there eventually.
Nobody except Spammer sends me an email.
All right.
We've got to wrap up the show, guys.
It's about time for the show to end.
Sad, cry, sniff, sniff.
How was my leg?
We're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts, starting with LankyStyle, who's been absent for the past hour.
He's been on my cell phone, ringing up my bill.
Use that as a name.
Yeah, it is fine.
That's a nice idea.
Please do.
Are we getting my final thought?
Yes, your final thought.
It's all Greek to me.
BroWalk, your final thought.
Thanks for being here again, by the way, bud.
Not a problem.
I just want to say, go out there, support Ultramix 2, and support Orange Lounge, support all of B-Money, because, hey, man,
You guys are like our Wonderbra, you are the wind beneath our wings, you are all that and a bucket of wings and etc.
etc.
and I shall cut myself off.
Coca-Cola, Wonderbra.
Explicit, your final thought.
Time to purchase WWX, Rumble Roses.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Loki, your final thought.
My headache's gone, that makes me happy.
My final thought is...
Hi.
That's it.
I have nothing else to say.
Jamie, your final thoughts?
I have to drive home in a freaking Benadryl coma.
Damnation.
I have to drive through the boring part of Haiti to get home.
And Mel has love for Didi.
Oh, freak, I hear you, Jess.
Don't worry, it wasn't intentional.
Jeez.
And I have to drive with a broken car.
We've given DDR Freak tons of plugs tonight.
Well, of course, the whole syndication thing helps.
Yeah, it's cool.
I mean, it's pretty dope.
We're starting to come together as one big Bimani bunch.
It's great.
Fucking Katamari, that's what it is.
Yeah, you know what, this DDR thing is going to die soon anyway, so we better all be prepared to be Katamari Damacy Radio and Katamari Damacy Freak.
No, we're all getting Katamari together, man.
You see, we built it up big enough to take DDR Freak, which is like the biggest of all of us.
You started with Orange Lounge, then you rolled up DDR, and now you're going to roll them up.
Yeah, seriously, seriously.
Orange Lounge has to roll up like all the other little Bumani sites before it can really take on Freak, okay?
No, I'm kidding.
To answer in the chat room, as I am feeling very, very ill right now, I may or may not be online when I get home.
I'm probably going to go right to bed, but we'll see.
It's all about Orange Lounge Town in the brand new, coming to the DS, Animal Crossing.
Bingo!
That's right, our free DS is going to be at my house soon.
I want a free DS, what the hell?
What is with you people and your hookups?
You're a free DS, you're a free Konami I'll feel good to have known that I earned my DS Out of two days of hard work
Way to put down everybody else, LankyStyle.
I think Dan earned his by having managed a GameStop for us on this one.
Alright, alright.
Final word of the show.
LankyStyle, I'm going to give you tonight's final word, Mr. LankyStyle.
One word to sum it all up.
One word to sum it all up.
MGS3, biatch!
That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.
Orange Lounge Radio Live is an Orange Lounge Radio production.
For more information about our station, visit our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.
Well, it's the holiday season and Santa is checking his list to see who is naughty or nice and I'm kind of feeling guilty, so I wrote a song.
So many presents, so little time Santa won't be coming by my house this year Cause I tried to drown my sister and I pierced my ear
Oh, Mama made it perfectly clear Santa don't like bad boys Especially Jewish ones!
Gnip Gnop and Lego blocks are what I desire So why'd I have to set the pizza guy's hair on fire?
I told him I was sorry, I'm a liar So no toys for me
I don't deserve them.
I couldn't wait for a big wheel as the holiday neared.
But then I told my grandma that she had a beard.
Dear Santa, I know what my problem is.
Why I can't be good.
It's a fear of intimacy.
You see, my whole life, whenever I've met someone really great like you and
I keep feeling I'm getting too close to them.
Something inside me makes me want to screw it up.
So in a weird way, the reason I'm so bad is because I love you so much, Santa.
Rock'em, sock'em, robot is what I was hoping for.
But then I made a death threat to Vice President Gore.
Oh, Santa won't be knocking on my door, cause he's a big, fat whore.
What made me say that shoots and letters would be so good indeed?
So why'd I have to sell that copper bag of weed?
So Santa, please give me my easy bake oven.
I swear I thought silly ghosts were made for lovin'.
So Santa, won't you accept my apologies?
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
