He's weak.

01:18.760 --> 01:21.260
You're already on the line.

01:21.260 --> 01:27.260
This mommy talks radio like so much boring.

01:29.260 --> 01:30.760
Oh, God.

01:30.760 --> 01:33.260
Heh heh heh heh heh. Call me daddy.

01:47.260 --> 01:52.760
Orange Lounge makes me plenty of muh-uh-muh-trap-muh-cocky.

01:52.760 --> 01:56.760
Just kidding, Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that.

01:56.760 --> 01:57.760
In this episode...

02:35.760 --> 02:42.760
You're tuned in to the B-Money Scene's most interesting station of all things, Baloney.

02:42.760 --> 02:45.760
Actually, I should have been the internet's radio station.

02:45.760 --> 02:47.760
You'd think I'd have my script memorized by now.

02:47.760 --> 02:49.760
I'm out of it.

02:49.760 --> 02:50.760
You've got to turn it on.

02:50.760 --> 02:51.760
Turn it on.

02:51.760 --> 02:53.760
The butt money.

02:53.760 --> 02:55.760
Butt money?

02:55.760 --> 02:57.760
My name is Rob Roberts.

02:57.760 --> 02:59.760
You might know me better as Sky.

02:59.760 --> 03:01.760
Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts.

03:01.760 --> 03:03.760
In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm.

03:03.760 --> 03:05.760
Say hello to Miss Jamie Summers.

03:05.760 --> 03:08.760
You know her better as Dark Sakura.

03:08.760 --> 03:09.760
I have food.

03:09.760 --> 03:11.760
And that's yummy.

03:11.760 --> 03:13.760
What kind of food?

03:13.760 --> 03:18.760
I have a low carb copia with roast beef and provolone cheese and spinach.

03:18.760 --> 03:23.760
Her mic is really, really low. Can we do anything to turn off her mic over here?

03:23.760 --> 03:26.760
We'll have to look into it. Alright.

03:26.760 --> 03:31.760
I said that I'm fabulous and wonderful and the world should worship me.

03:31.760 --> 03:34.760
As always. Tell us something new.

03:34.760 --> 03:36.760
I have food.

03:36.760 --> 03:37.760
Okay.

03:37.760 --> 03:39.760
And it's better than all of your food.

03:39.760 --> 03:46.760
Also joining us tonight, earning his title right now, trying to fix Jamie's mic there, Techmasa Loki.

03:46.760 --> 03:49.760
Hi.

03:49.760 --> 03:50.760
Alright.

03:50.760 --> 03:53.760
And he can't say anything else because he's too busy working.

03:53.760 --> 03:58.760
Also joining us tonight in studio, a familiar special guest. He's here an awful lot.

03:58.760 --> 04:02.760
Say hello to Arcadian42.

04:02.760 --> 04:04.760
Hello.

04:04.760 --> 04:07.760
And, uh, wow. That's it. It's just us tonight.

04:07.760 --> 04:12.360
A couple back-to-back weeks of really big shows with a lot of people here, but tonight...

04:12.360 --> 04:13.960
They all abandoned us.

04:13.960 --> 04:16.760
Nah, tonight we were forgotten about... No, it's fine.

04:16.760 --> 04:21.460
We're going back to just feeling the love of the people who are here every single week,

04:21.460 --> 04:24.160
or in, you know, Arcadia's case, damn near every single week.

04:24.160 --> 04:25.960
And a mouthful of spinach.

04:25.960 --> 04:27.560
You're louder now, though. That's good.

04:27.560 --> 04:28.760
And I have spinach.

04:29.760 --> 04:30.960
Call that love.

04:32.160 --> 04:32.760
Alright.

04:33.960 --> 04:37.160
Tonight, pretty big show. We actually have a lot of music tonight.

04:37.160 --> 04:40.160
Well, probably the talking is probably going to be a little bit less

04:40.160 --> 04:43.120
I mean, of course, we still got a lot to say so we're gonna be doing a lot of talking about one

04:43.120 --> 04:45.120
I want to warn you guys got a lot of music

04:46.560 --> 04:50.240
We got a lot of music for you guys tonight as well because we have

04:50.800 --> 04:57.240
An exclusive for you guys the new ultra mix 2 songs. I'm not talking about the same stuff that was on the v-rare

04:57.240 --> 05:00.920
We already played that I'm talking about the brand new songs from ultra mix 2

05:00.920 --> 05:05.520
that isn't anywhere else on the internet yet and for instance in this first break

05:05.520 --> 05:10.120
we're gonna hear of ten Goku or point five nine both both you know the song

05:10.120 --> 05:13.860

after all and a new song called altitude all from ultra mix 2 we're gonna play a

05:18.320 --> 05:23.040
whole lot of new ultra mix 2 songs ultra mix 2 is on everyone's mind this weekend

05:23.040 --> 05:26.280
I think if you're a DDR player you've you've heard about this game and if

05:26.280 --> 05:30.680
you're an Xbox owner you probably own this game by now or you're getting it

05:30.680 --> 05:34.880
very soon and then of course on top of that we've got all the Japanese imports

05:34.880 --> 05:38.880
as well so a lot of big news tonight we'll get to all that after this break

05:38.880 --> 05:44.840
let's go to it also whoops I can't I gotta remember this to the Akira Moka

05:44.840 --> 05:50.560

05:54.560 --> 05:59.360
lust after his musical talent there you go there's the Jamie I know all right

05:59.360 --> 06:02.360
And I lust after his body.

06:02.360 --> 06:07.360
Oh my god! Tonight is the night of Revelations!

06:07.360 --> 06:09.360
And that was just funny.

06:09.360 --> 06:12.360
Loki lusts after a man.

06:12.360 --> 06:14.360
No. No, I don't.

06:14.360 --> 06:17.360
Maybe that's in the same way I lust after, like, Margaret Jones.

06:17.360 --> 06:19.360
You mean he's not a giant robot?

06:19.360 --> 06:22.360
In the same way I lust after...

06:22.360 --> 06:23.360
I don't know.

06:23.360 --> 06:25.360
I lust after Teriyaki Saw.

06:25.360 --> 06:29.360
Yes, oh, Benihana Teriyaki saw it, so yeah, less after that.

06:29.360 --> 06:31.360
Okay, yeah, sorry, break time!

06:31.360 --> 06:38.360
We'll be right back after this. Music from Ultramix 2. Enjoy, you guys.

08:31.360 --> 08:45.360
She loves the voices in her mind They tell her, don't you believe

08:45.360 --> 08:55.360
She's tired of smiling at me A little bit sadder as it comes back inside of me

08:55.360 --> 08:59.360
You know it ain't for me

08:59.360 --> 09:02.360
Cause you're watching the same inside

09:02.360 --> 09:06.360
No good to give, no meaning to leave

09:06.360 --> 09:09.360
No missing from the night

09:09.360 --> 09:14.360
Everything I've known

09:28.360 --> 09:33.360
I'm the one expecting everything I know

12:03.360 --> 12:17.480
Hi ho, Kermit the Frog here informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

12:17.480 --> 12:26.920
is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

12:26.920 --> 12:33.240
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio episode number 119 on this lovely November 21, 2004.

12:33.240 --> 12:36.680
First off, to those of you guys that are brand new to the station, tuning in for the first

12:36.680 --> 12:39.080
time, big welcome to you guys, welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.

12:39.080 --> 12:44.200
I know that our rebroadcasts that are starting now over on DDR Freak on Friday nights are

12:44.200 --> 12:47.760
getting a pretty good reception, so I think we might get some new people because of that.

12:47.760 --> 12:53.480
So a big thank you to you guys for tuning in over here and listening to the live experience.

12:53.480 --> 12:56.240
Certainly check out our website if you haven't yet, orangeloungeradio.com, because there's

12:56.240 --> 12:59.620
all sorts of ways you can interact live with our show on Sunday nights.

12:59.620 --> 13:03.400
And of course, a really big thank you to the folks at DDR Freak who've also been syndicating

13:03.400 --> 13:07.800
our show, allowing those folks who can't listen to the show on Sunday night get a chance to

13:07.800 --> 13:10.360
listen and definitely support internet radio.

13:10.360 --> 13:14.520
And together, we can destroy crappy commercial radio.

13:14.520 --> 13:16.400
With a shotgun?

13:16.400 --> 13:19.440
With a BFG, for all I care.

13:19.440 --> 13:20.440
A pretty gun.

13:20.440 --> 13:26.600
Anyway, in there we had some songs from Ultramix 2, brand new, playing them for the first time.

13:26.600 --> 13:31.120
Loki and I just were recording those off our Xbox not too long ago, hope you guys enjoyed

13:31.120 --> 13:32.120
it.

13:32.120 --> 13:33.720
I'm giving you guys something to check out tonight.

13:33.720 --> 13:37.640
Those of you guys especially who haven't gotten a chance to check out Ultra Mix 2, fabulous

13:37.640 --> 13:40.760
fabulous game, which we'll talk about a little more in detail later, but first I want to

13:40.760 --> 13:41.760
get your guys' thoughts.

13:41.760 --> 13:43.200
What did you guys think of those songs?

13:43.200 --> 13:46.520
Jamie, I know you had some pretty strong thoughts on Tengoku Remix.

13:46.520 --> 13:48.000
Okay, the Tengoku one was ass.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
It was utter.

13:49.000 --> 13:53.440
Okay, they take a song that was perfect the way it was, and added a bunch of extraneous

13:53.440 --> 13:55.640
crap that had no business being there.

13:55.640 --> 13:59.260
You know what's interesting is that a lot of that same feedback in the chat room, I'm

13:59.260 --> 14:05.920
seeing a lot of Ziz says it just sucks that they killed Tengoku with this remix, MPQ says

14:05.920 --> 14:11.260
too much kid, not enough, Tengoku, or.59 however you want to say it.

14:11.260 --> 14:17.900
It's just, it really was a lot of extraneous stuff that really didn't need to be there.

14:17.900 --> 14:21.300
You know what though, I'll admit, I actually kind of like it. It's like one of my more

14:21.300 --> 14:25.380
favorite remixes. It's different and I can see why people don't like it because it is

14:25.380 --> 14:28.500
so different than the original and a lot of people consider the original to be

14:28.500 --> 14:29.220
like one of the

14:29.220 --> 14:32.740
staple Bamani songs. I mean, honestly, it's in like every

14:32.740 --> 14:36.580
home 2DX version. Well, not every, but almost damn near every. And then, you know, it was a

14:36.580 --> 14:37.900
classic DDR song.

14:37.900 --> 14:41.140
So it's kind of like when somebody touches that and makes it different, people are kind of

14:41.140 --> 14:41.620
nervous.

14:41.620 --> 14:45.780
I kind of dug it, though. Certainly more so than a lot of those

14:45.780 --> 14:50.140
remixes we got on previous DDR mixes. It's the same thing like what they did with the

14:50.140 --> 14:51.260
Battle Royale manga.

14:51.260 --> 14:55.140
They took something that was fine the way it was and blew it way out of the

14:55.140 --> 14:58.960
way out of proportion by Americanizing the text too much. I think they Americanize the

14:58.960 --> 15:08.360
mixing too much in this. It sucks. It's too big, you know? It was fine, simple, the way

15:08.360 --> 15:09.360
it was.

15:09.360 --> 15:13.840
Well, to each their own opinion, but certainly UltraMix 2 offers something for everyone,

15:13.840 --> 15:17.960
so even if you didn't really like that song, maybe you liked After All by Delirium. I would

15:17.960 --> 15:20.960
hope that you would like that song, Jamie, considering it was a former cage match pick

15:20.960 --> 15:27.840
yours here on Orange Lounge Radio. I think she likes that song. Not a whole lot of reception

15:27.840 --> 15:31.620
from the chat room on that one, but of course we had known about that song for a little

15:31.620 --> 15:36.220
while now, so that's nothing new, but it gave guys a chance there to check out the new edit

15:36.220 --> 15:41.180
there of After All. And then a brand new song called Altitude, which we were hearing for

15:41.180 --> 15:46.140
the first time on the show here by a group, Cause & Conception. Definitely a really different

15:46.140 --> 15:49.580
sort of track for DDR. Definitely a kind of song you haven't really heard in DDR a whole

15:49.580 --> 15:54.380
lot before. What did you guys think of that? I like that song. It's pretty cool. Yeah,

15:54.380 --> 15:59.460
I like it too. It's just different and it really works for DDR because you know there's

15:59.460 --> 16:03.820
those kids that love those speed ups and slow downs and that song's got all that fun stuff

16:03.820 --> 16:09.340
in it. I kind of like the drum and bass sound to it a lot too. Which interestingly enough

16:09.340 --> 16:12.380
brings up another topic. We were actually supposed to have Conception on the show I

16:12.380 --> 16:16.440
think last week, but unfortunately, I don't know what happened. We just kind of got out

16:16.440 --> 16:19.800
touch and I wasn't able to contact him last Sunday but we'll try to get him

16:19.800 --> 16:23.200
back on the show at a later date I know he still wants to do the show so we'll

16:23.200 --> 16:26.720
see we can do because I want to ask him about how does it feel to have a song in

16:26.720 --> 16:34.320
DDR Loki that seems like okay put down the dating sim on the DS for a minute

16:34.320 --> 16:37.640
what do you think altitude that seems like the kind of song you would put in a

16:37.640 --> 16:40.800
cage match I don't know what you think altitude I liked it it was cool yeah

16:40.800 --> 16:45.160
different have you played that one on all to mix to you I think once yeah it's

16:45.160 --> 16:48.240
it's different it's kinda cool because a lot of people are going oh my god

16:48.240 --> 16:51.840
finally we're getting like a US exclusive song that's a nine footer

16:51.840 --> 16:55.920
of course not only is there a nine there's like ten US exclusives right now too

16:55.920 --> 16:59.320
what are you doing over there on the DS you look like you're scratching off paint or

16:59.320 --> 17:01.480
something with your stylus

17:01.480 --> 17:03.520
it's all black

17:03.520 --> 17:07.780
oh you're doing picto chat and you're just making all black boxes

17:07.780 --> 17:09.520
lovely

17:09.520 --> 17:12.960
yes of course today the twenty first being the release of the DS as well and

17:12.960 --> 17:17.820
And not only Loki, but myself had to go pick up one of these, and...

17:17.820 --> 17:20.240
I heard they were supposed to be in short supply, but I don't know, it doesn't seem

17:20.240 --> 17:21.720
like there was much of a problem finding...

17:21.720 --> 17:22.720
It wasn't that hard to find.

17:22.720 --> 17:23.720
It wasn't that hard to find.

17:23.720 --> 17:24.720
We found it.

17:24.720 --> 17:25.720
You guys have DS's?

17:25.720 --> 17:26.720
Yeah, let me get one in the back.

17:26.720 --> 17:27.720
Well, that was difficult.

17:27.720 --> 17:28.720
Alright.

17:28.720 --> 17:31.780
I don't want to get too far off base here, because we have to start off the show as we

17:31.780 --> 17:33.280
start off every week's show.

17:33.280 --> 17:37.920
Did we want to talk, since we brought up Conception?

17:37.920 --> 17:38.920
A little later.

17:38.920 --> 17:39.920
We'll do that later.

17:39.920 --> 17:40.920
Okay.

17:40.920 --> 17:41.920
Anyways.

17:41.920 --> 17:44.560
We have to get to how was your week, how was your day, because that's an Orange Laundry

17:44.560 --> 17:45.560
of tradition, dammit.

17:45.560 --> 17:49.760
So, Jamie, I know you're working over there, but how was your week, how was your day?

17:49.760 --> 17:50.760
My week was shit.

17:50.760 --> 17:52.680
Oh, I'm sorry.

17:52.680 --> 17:56.280
My day was half shit.

17:56.280 --> 18:01.800
I normally enjoy being female.

18:01.800 --> 18:04.420
This is one of the days I don't.

18:04.420 --> 18:06.040
I think I know where this is going, okay?

18:06.040 --> 18:08.140
I'm not going to say anything else.

18:08.140 --> 18:11.440
I've been in a crappy, crappy mood all day.

18:11.440 --> 18:19.920
I overslept, and then it took quite a bit for me to be happy again today, so I am now

18:19.920 --> 18:30.860
in a better mood than I've been all day, thanks to the power of good conversation, and coffee,

18:30.860 --> 18:34.080
and salty food.

18:34.080 --> 18:35.700
I normally hate salty food.

18:35.700 --> 18:39.300
I went out and got me some hot dogs.

18:39.300 --> 18:45.900
were salty hot dogs from the 7-11. Oh, 7-11. Are they big wieners? Are they fat wieners?

18:45.900 --> 18:53.460
They were big fat wieners and they were so hot. Okay. What kind of sauce do you enjoy

18:53.460 --> 18:58.300
on your wiener? I don't put sauce on my wiener. You like your wieners raw. I like it plain.

18:58.300 --> 19:04.980
Raw. She eats her wieners raw. Awesome. But, no, the rest of the week was kind of okay.

19:04.980 --> 19:09.820
I've been mostly gearing up toward my trip to Alabama because I'm not going to be here

19:09.820 --> 19:17.180
next week because I'm going to be in Alabama and not here, although I will have my laptop

19:17.180 --> 19:23.860
with me and there may be some Skype potential if I can find a reliable broadband.

19:23.860 --> 19:24.860
That's next week's show?

19:24.860 --> 19:25.860
You're not going to be here?

19:25.860 --> 19:26.860
Yeah.

19:26.860 --> 19:27.860
Okay.

19:27.860 --> 19:28.860
I'm sort of going to be in another state.

19:28.860 --> 19:29.860
Yeah, I know.

19:29.860 --> 19:30.860
I know.

19:30.860 --> 19:31.860
That happened to me once this year.

19:31.860 --> 19:34.780
I'm going to come back with a fro because I cut my hair short and the humidity is going

19:34.780 --> 19:37.960
to make it all poof up. It's gonna be funny.

19:37.960 --> 19:43.100
Are you gonna come back with a little bit of Southern accent? I thought I already had a good one.

19:43.100 --> 19:47.140
It's not that strong though. I never really had much of one to begin with.

19:47.140 --> 19:48.280
But um...

19:48.280 --> 19:53.100
And now today, during the show, I'm gonna be kinda quiet because I'm doing a paper on

19:53.100 --> 19:57.140
a focus on ethics for business law. You, ethics?

19:57.140 --> 20:01.860
Okay, you can shut up right now, okay? I'm just teasing. I have ethics.

20:01.860 --> 20:03.860
I have... some.

20:31.860 --> 20:38.860
me and my fucked up morals. But nah, I'm gonna, it's gonna be cool because I'm gonna go see

20:39.820 --> 20:46.260
my mama's son, and I'm gonna see a bunch of my friends, and actually a few people from

20:46.260 --> 20:49.580
DDR Freak are gonna be coming down to see me.

20:49.580 --> 20:52.300
Yay, Freak!

20:52.300 --> 20:56.740
And I figure maybe I'll get some interviews or something, or a statement from various

20:56.740 --> 20:57.500
peoples.

20:57.500 --> 21:01.740
Please do, we do want some statements on record from some of our pals in Alabama.

21:01.740 --> 21:04.020
and the surrounding areas

21:04.020 --> 21:06.260
so uh... that's pretty much uh...

21:06.260 --> 21:07.540
pretty much it

21:07.540 --> 21:08.940
yeah

21:08.940 --> 21:09.880
sounds good to me

21:09.880 --> 21:11.940
uh... let's go to

21:11.940 --> 21:15.580
excuse me, let's go over to... you'll have to excuse me guys, I have a cough tonight

21:15.580 --> 21:16.960
and we're not um...

21:16.960 --> 21:19.060
since we are basically run out of our

21:19.060 --> 21:19.960
our living room

21:19.960 --> 21:22.740
uh... we don't have like a cough button like real radio stations do

21:22.740 --> 21:25.540
so if I cough like right into the microphone

21:25.540 --> 21:28.380
yeah, seriously like if you go to real radio they have these cough buttons which basically mute

21:28.380 --> 21:31.100
your speaker real fast if you think you're going to cough

21:31.100 --> 21:33.100
Yeah, like a mute button on the phone.

21:33.100 --> 21:38.100
I prefer to call those make fun of the customer buttons.

21:38.100 --> 21:41.100
See, unfortunately we don't have make fun of the listener buttons.

21:41.100 --> 21:44.100
So, you know, we don't have that. We can't afford cough buttons.

21:44.100 --> 21:48.100
So if I just cough in your ear and blow out your speaker, my apologies, but I'm sick.

21:48.100 --> 21:53.100
I totally agree with you, Rob. Click. Those listeners are stupid. Click.

21:53.100 --> 21:56.100
Oh, wait. Just kidding.

21:56.100 --> 21:59.100
Click. Shut up. We get a dollar for everyone that listens. Click.

21:59.100 --> 22:00.100
Just kidding, I wish.

22:00.100 --> 22:02.100
Alright, Loki, how was your week? How was your day?

22:02.100 --> 22:05.100
Um, my week was alright. It was pretty uneventful.

22:05.100 --> 22:10.100
I tried playing Grand Theft Auto my style, which includes cheating,

22:10.100 --> 22:17.100
and, um, my GameShark 2 crapped out on me, so I bought a new, um, code breaker today.

22:17.100 --> 22:19.100
Cheaters never prosper!

22:19.100 --> 22:20.100
No, she-

22:20.100 --> 22:21.100
Oh, yeah, we do!

22:21.100 --> 22:22.100
Shitty software-

22:22.100 --> 22:25.100
Oh, what do you mean, cheaters never prosper? Bush got elected!

22:25.100 --> 22:38.360
Anyways, anyways, um, so, anyways, so, um, today we got the DS, which is a lot of fun,

22:38.360 --> 22:46.720
and, um, yeah, it, it, we basically started off using the DS in a very mature fashion,

22:46.720 --> 22:52.120
chatting with each other via text in a chat room, literally six feet away.

22:52.120 --> 22:53.120
Yes.

22:53.120 --> 22:54.120
From each other.

22:54.120 --> 23:00.120
He was sitting on the couch, which you can see on cam, and I was sitting in the Jamie's seat, which you can't see on cam, but it's really close.

23:00.120 --> 23:02.120
On the other side of the coffee table.

23:02.120 --> 23:13.120
We were playing PictoChat and writing dirty words like vagina and things on the PictoChat and drawing middle fingers to each other and stuff, and it was hilarious. This is what the DS was made for.

23:13.120 --> 23:18.120
I love the DS just for that. That is the best feature right there.

23:18.120 --> 23:23.600
Well, I actually it was really cool because we were playing a metroid prime hunters at

23:24.400 --> 23:29.800
The you know the demo at Best Buy and I got to see the control on it's awesome. It's just

23:30.600 --> 23:36.200
Really smart. I'm having issues with it. It's too much for me. I miss my Atari joystick

23:36.200 --> 23:40.220
Okay, one button one button for everything now. I like it

23:40.220 --> 23:40.780
I like it

23:40.780 --> 23:44.460
But it cramps up my hand like a bitch because you have to hold it in a really weird way

23:44.460 --> 23:50.460
And so, like, my finger's all fucked up from trying to reach around to the back to, you know, push the, uh, L button.

23:50.460 --> 23:51.460
And it's just like-

23:51.460 --> 23:52.460
Sounds dirty.

23:52.460 --> 23:56.460
Can't quite get the reach around, huh?

23:56.460 --> 24:02.460
I guess, yeah, whatever. Anyways, um, so, other than that, um...

24:02.460 --> 24:06.460
I don't know, what else did I do? Oh, we went to Benny Hoffs today and that rocked.

24:06.460 --> 24:07.460
rocked

24:07.460 --> 24:10.860
cuz we we're gonna go some like uh... cheapo uh...

24:10.860 --> 24:14.380
teriyaki whole place in the end of not being

24:14.380 --> 24:16.780
open on a restaurant's closed on sunday

24:16.780 --> 24:19.780
religious restaurant particularly

24:19.780 --> 24:22.540
seriously i don't take place close on sunday they don't have to play here

24:22.540 --> 24:23.340
though

24:23.340 --> 24:24.900
have one of the line

24:24.900 --> 24:30.740
that's why you're going to get sick play in alabama okay

24:30.740 --> 24:31.660
anyway

24:31.660 --> 24:35.080
uh... so yeah i want to go to south sack any two pop eyes

24:35.080 --> 24:38.360
dodgeball. I could eat five Popeyes in Mobile.

24:38.360 --> 24:40.520
Sorry, Logie.

24:40.520 --> 24:44.040
Yeah, sorry. But not really.

24:44.040 --> 24:46.540
So anyways, so yeah,

24:46.540 --> 24:49.240
it's pretty much a lot of Final Fantasy.

24:49.240 --> 24:51.940
I've leveled my White Mage up

24:51.940 --> 24:53.520
five levels or so.

24:53.520 --> 24:54.920
Addict.

24:54.920 --> 24:59.060
And um...

24:59.060 --> 25:00.460
What else?

25:00.460 --> 25:03.000
Not really much else other than that. I mean, we got

25:03.000 --> 25:07.240
you know, Ultramix 2, so I watch people play that.

25:07.240 --> 25:11.080
And that's pretty much it for right now, yeah.

25:11.080 --> 25:16.760
I think so. Alright. RTDN 42, how was your week, how was your day?

25:16.760 --> 25:21.840
Eh, my week was kinda eh. I was sick most of the week with a cold, but

25:21.840 --> 25:26.280
working. Wasn't that bad. It was just sniffly all week, and

25:26.280 --> 25:29.920
so forth. Hit the work. Then,

25:29.920 --> 25:35.040
went on Tuesday when I got my smog test for my car, so I can get full registration.

25:35.040 --> 25:39.440
Then, after doing that on Thursday, I went down to the courthouse to see if I could pay

25:39.440 --> 25:44.040
off my ticket for the registration thing, hopefully.

25:44.040 --> 25:48.460
Oh yes, and that was the one you got after this show a couple of weeks ago, yes, alright.

25:48.460 --> 25:53.080
But he said that I need the final registration, or have to go to DMV or something, so they

25:53.080 --> 25:57.800
extended the date, so I have that until the next month to get all that done.

25:57.800 --> 26:04.800
They'll let me correct it and only have to pay 10 bucks to $191, which would be a bitch if I had to do that.

26:04.800 --> 26:11.800
Then I paid some 2DX this week and ordered 8th Style on Wednesday.

26:11.800 --> 26:13.800
You're going to get 8th Style before me cry?

26:13.800 --> 26:16.800
Yeah, well it's probably going to be like two weeks or so, I don't know.

26:16.800 --> 26:20.800
Because I ordered from YesAsia and they don't have any stock at the moment.

26:20.800 --> 26:25.800
I definitely want to play some of the 8th Style consumer stuff tonight because there's a song on there I love so much.

26:25.800 --> 26:28.200
I'm going to be getting mine from Playasia.

26:28.200 --> 26:30.200
Everybody's getting 8th Style but me crying.

26:30.200 --> 26:31.200
I'm supposed to be getting it for Christmas.

26:31.200 --> 26:33.200
And I still don't have 7th Style crying.

26:33.200 --> 26:36.200
Well, it's either 8th Style or I think I'm getting a tablet.

26:36.200 --> 26:40.200
Because I'm changing my major to an R major.

26:40.200 --> 26:41.200
Okay.

26:41.200 --> 26:45.200
See, didn't do much else.

26:45.200 --> 26:46.200
Played a bit more 2DX today.

26:46.200 --> 26:50.200
Came here yesterday and played UltraMix and that was pretty cool.

26:50.200 --> 26:53.200
Yes, thanks to you guys that tuned in to the 20 November special yesterday.

26:53.200 --> 26:54.200
You rock.

26:54.200 --> 26:55.200
We're going to talk about that later.

26:55.200 --> 26:57.700
Sure. We are going to talk about it later. I'll talk about it then.

26:57.700 --> 26:59.700
Yeah, we'll talk a little more about Ultramix 2 later.

26:59.700 --> 27:02.700
Okay. And, that much else. That's good.

27:03.700 --> 27:04.700
Yes, Loki.

27:04.700 --> 27:11.700
I forgot to mention, I watched the second greatest show to come to Spike TV.

27:11.700 --> 27:14.700
It would be, Hey, Spring of Trivia.

27:16.200 --> 27:21.200
Spike TV is the most intelligent station I've ever seen because they are bringing...

27:21.200 --> 27:25.360
You said spike TV and intelligent in the same sentence.

27:25.360 --> 27:29.800
Listen, they have a good video game award show, and they're bringing Japanese game shows

27:29.800 --> 27:31.000
over here to America.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.720
And reruns of Blind Date 24 hours a day.

27:33.720 --> 27:34.720
Exactly!

27:34.720 --> 27:35.720
That fucking rocks!

27:35.720 --> 27:36.720
And you know what else they have?

27:36.720 --> 27:41.280
World's wildest police chases, and we watch that every fucking day.

27:41.280 --> 27:42.600
And that's awesome.

27:42.600 --> 27:44.960
So they have really kick-ass TV.

27:44.960 --> 27:49.040
But hey, Spring of Trivia, it's the weirdest show you'll ever see.

27:49.040 --> 27:50.040
It's just a trivia show.

27:50.040 --> 27:56.080
really game show, and the winners at the end, they win bread.

27:56.080 --> 28:03.960
Sounds like one of our giveaways. And it's great though, because one of the trivia things

28:03.960 --> 28:10.760
was, Mozart wrote a song called Lick My Ass, and he actually did write a song called Lick

28:10.760 --> 28:15.600
My Ass, and then they performed the song Lick My Ass, which was translated into English,

28:15.600 --> 28:21.600
It was great. It was like, um, you know, wonderful sensation. Lick my ass.

28:21.600 --> 28:28.600
It was great. You just have to watch that show. It's great.

28:28.600 --> 28:39.600
You know what? Having taken quite a bit of music history when I first started college, because I started off as a music major, that doesn't surprise me one single bit.

28:39.600 --> 28:42.880
You know what? Box said it right though.

28:42.880 --> 28:47.160
Lick my ass is a wonderful sensation.

28:47.160 --> 28:50.160
No, not... Mozart. Mozart.

28:50.160 --> 28:53.800
Mozart in my mind. Whoever! The dead guy!

28:53.800 --> 28:58.120
You know, that's what, see talking is now, you know, take that song

28:58.120 --> 29:01.840
and you know, put it into like another Renaissance song

29:01.840 --> 29:06.200
for like, you know, 2DX Blue or whatever the next one's gonna be.

29:06.200 --> 29:10.120
Gold. Anyways, 2DXT, yellow.

29:10.120 --> 29:14.180
Oh, and one more, one more thing. This will be the last thing. I went and played Derby

29:14.180 --> 29:20.180
Owners Club, finally, at Golf Land. And, and I made my horse, I EAT CHILDREN.

29:20.180 --> 29:24.220
That is the best name of a horse ever.

29:24.220 --> 29:27.600
I heard that Derby Owners Club is actually really popular at Rosso Golf Land, right now.

29:27.600 --> 29:29.660
Dude, the techs there play it.

29:29.660 --> 29:33.280
And I heard that Milpitas Golf Land got lots of angry phone calls.

29:33.280 --> 29:35.380
Oh, yes.

29:35.380 --> 29:39.140
For once we have the cool game on the block, actually we had Disney's Rave too for a while

29:39.140 --> 29:41.740
there, but for twice we have the cool game on the block.

29:41.740 --> 29:44.240
I really, really hope they can keep it in good shape this time.

29:44.240 --> 29:47.260
I gave poop to a small child.

29:47.260 --> 29:48.780
Well the coin slots are a little iffy.

29:48.780 --> 29:49.780
Wait, wait, wait.

29:49.780 --> 29:51.340
How did you give poop to a small child?

29:51.340 --> 29:55.780
I bred some of Iguana Girl's horses because I missed having my specials.

29:55.780 --> 30:01.180
The first one I built was an albino so I named it Shiroi as a female.

30:01.180 --> 30:04.500
If it was a male I would have named it Michael Jackson or something because I think its parent

30:04.500 --> 30:11.220
was Latoya Jackson. And no, it was one of her half and halves. Anyway, my second one

30:11.220 --> 30:17.540
came out all gray. So I named him Poop. And I gave him to a small child. And then my last

30:17.540 --> 30:24.220
one was a panda, so I named it Ganguro. Here, have some poop, little child. Oh, you should

30:24.220 --> 30:27.740
have seen the kid. I was like, here, I named my horse Poop. You can have him. And the kid

30:27.740 --> 30:39.500
I just grinned. I got poop! He just had that, heh heh heh grin. Can you imagine the parents

30:39.500 --> 30:48.260
getting the phone call? Could you tell your child not to bring poop to school again? Sorry.

30:48.260 --> 30:52.500
But yeah, we got a stardom young in the life of horse racing, and you know, betting on

30:52.500 --> 30:59.460
tracks anyways I'm then go baby go explicit joined us during that first

30:59.460 --> 31:03.380
commercial break and you know he's always got a lot to say what's up how

31:03.380 --> 31:07.220
was your week how was your day oh very good had to take how to take like a few

31:07.220 --> 31:12.060
tests to this week passed off practically passed all of them and I

31:12.060 --> 31:17.340
actually finally played Derby's ownership club at RVGL go baby go go

31:17.340 --> 31:23.340
Yo, baby, yo! And it's about time our video got onto my good side.

31:23.340 --> 31:27.340
I still haven't gone there yet. I'm still a little scared.

31:27.340 --> 31:31.340
That place... Bemani Games go and they die there. I'm scared that when I go there,

31:31.340 --> 31:35.340
Derby Owners Club is going to have like two monitors missing. This is going to make me cry.

31:35.340 --> 31:39.340
More kids stealing the... More kids breaking all the TV.

31:39.340 --> 31:42.340
Seriously. Graffiti or something, I don't know.

31:42.340 --> 31:45.340
Oh, and finally got the DS.

31:45.340 --> 31:49.340
Yeah, the pictogram can online.

31:49.340 --> 31:55.340
Were you here when we were talking about how Loki and I were sitting just six feet from each other, writing vagina, and sending middle finger pictures back and forth?

31:55.340 --> 32:01.340
I just got here. And I'm hiding right now with my fuck you hat.

32:01.340 --> 32:11.340
You have to put that on cam so they can see. Cam over at www.orangesonitrader.com. If you can't see the hat that Xplizit is wearing, it says fuck you in sign language. It's pretty nice.

32:11.340 --> 32:18.940
Yeah, right now I have metric point hunters. It feels pretty good so far. It's just hard

32:18.940 --> 32:19.940
to get used to, really.

32:19.940 --> 32:22.820
Are you having problems with the reach around like Loki is?

32:22.820 --> 32:24.940
Not really. I actually got used to it very quickly.

32:24.940 --> 32:25.940
Okay.

32:25.940 --> 32:33.740
I can shoot. It's just shooting is the big problem. That's the only thing. That is all.

32:33.740 --> 32:41.060
Sorry. Does everything have to be about gay sex, really?

32:41.060 --> 32:42.060
Yes.

32:42.060 --> 32:49.580
You're making me think D.S. stands for dual sexuality.

32:49.580 --> 32:56.660
I thought D.S. stood for me. Fuck y'all.

32:56.660 --> 32:58.500
Okay.

32:58.500 --> 33:02.500
I have no other real material tonight, so I resort to Dick Fart and gay sex jokes. I'm

33:02.500 --> 33:04.000
I'm sorry you guys.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.820
Yeah, how does it feel to have a- I'm offended, I need to sue.

33:06.820 --> 33:07.940
How does it-

33:07.940 --> 33:11.100
Go ahead, you ain't gonna get blood out of a turnip, honey.

33:11.100 --> 33:14.940
Oh, you mean the DS? Oh, I thought you meant me, my dick and fart and gay sex jokes. No.

33:14.940 --> 33:19.980
I'm offended! How does it feel to have a game system named after you?

33:19.980 --> 33:26.800
My ego is gargantuan, like the size of the King of All Cosmoses package.

33:26.800 --> 33:29.080
I have decided, by the way, speaking of that,

33:29.080 --> 33:34.840
that I'm going to cosplay as the little prince, with a big ball of stuff.

33:34.840 --> 33:36.840
I should cosplay as the king, that would rock.

33:36.840 --> 33:40.060
You know, actually I forgot I did do something else yesterday.

33:40.060 --> 33:41.560
I went to the Rekacon kick-off.

33:41.560 --> 33:42.340
Oh, how was that?

33:42.340 --> 33:44.000
It was pretty good.

33:44.000 --> 33:51.940
What is Rekacon, for those who don't live in California? It's a local anime con, one of the smaller ones at one of the schools in Pittsburgh, California.

33:51.940 --> 33:56.440
It was pretty cool, I had a good time. I want to go again this year. They moved the date, though, didn't they?

33:56.440 --> 33:58.380
March, I think.

33:58.380 --> 34:03.620
But, um, I got a, like, a Phantasy Star Online art book, and I picked up a record, which

34:03.620 --> 34:07.900
I need to bring over here to rip the audio from, because it's all a bunch of old, like,

34:07.900 --> 34:14.260
late 70s, early 80s anime, like Galaxy Express and Yamato, and Lupin the Third. It's pretty

34:14.260 --> 34:15.260
cool.

34:15.260 --> 34:17.500
Are you on staff over there now?

34:17.500 --> 34:19.700
I'm supposed to be, but...

34:19.700 --> 34:21.220
See who you can talk to about a...

34:21.220 --> 34:22.740
I'm programming a database for them.

34:22.740 --> 34:27.740
I'll see what you can do about a live Ask Orange Lounge chat thing, because I've always

34:27.740 --> 34:31.780
wanted to do, you know how they have the anime cons? They have the, you know, the rooms with,

34:31.780 --> 34:37.020
you know, the ask the person questions about costuming, ask the voice over actor questions.

34:37.020 --> 34:42.980
I want to do Ask Orange Lounge Live. I'll talk to him. Alright, cool. But I, I just,

34:42.980 --> 34:45.860
you know, seeing all the costumes, I was like, you know what, actually I should do. And someone

34:45.860 --> 34:51.300
suggested, by the way, I got a free copy of The Sims 2, which I'm giving to Iguana Girl.

34:51.300 --> 34:58.980
But I'm going to be, he gave me some ideas for a skit I can do for the masquerade.

34:58.980 --> 35:02.780
And that would be put little, you know, Lego houses and stuff on the ground and roll over

35:02.780 --> 35:03.780
it with a giant ball.

35:03.780 --> 35:08.620
They have, like, this big display behind me that's these legs in this humongous package.

35:08.620 --> 35:10.760
Awesome.

35:10.760 --> 35:15.180
You know if they do put Katamari Damacy on the DS, the king will have to be, like, both

35:15.180 --> 35:16.180
screens.

35:16.180 --> 35:18.020
His package will take up the entire lower screen.

35:18.020 --> 35:19.020
That would be awesome.

35:19.020 --> 35:28.020
Although I'm wondering how one so endowed could come out with something so tiny.

35:28.020 --> 35:33.020
I should be getting my game, the Japanese version in a day or two.

35:33.020 --> 35:36.020
I got off eBay for about the same price as they cost me.

35:36.020 --> 35:37.020
Oh, so you bought the Japanese version?

35:37.020 --> 35:38.020
Yeah.

35:38.020 --> 35:39.020
Oh, very cool.

35:39.020 --> 35:43.020
Of course, they didn't change much, except the words, but hey.

35:43.020 --> 35:46.020
Alright, my week and my day was pretty good.

35:46.020 --> 35:49.220
I didn't do a whole lot of Bomani playing, well except for Ultramix too, I've actually

35:49.220 --> 35:52.380
done a lot of DDR playing in the past three days, but I'll get into that a little bit

35:52.380 --> 35:53.380
later.

35:53.380 --> 35:57.340
I did not go out to Rosewood Golf Land with the others on what, like Wednesday or something?

35:57.340 --> 36:00.420
I don't know, I was supposed to go on a date the other night and I got ditched, so you

36:00.420 --> 36:02.780
know, life sucks sometimes, but what can you do?

36:02.780 --> 36:06.060
Although I got an apology today, so that made me feel a little better.

36:06.060 --> 36:11.040
And one of my really really good friends is in the hospital for the second time this week,

36:11.040 --> 36:14.300
so Christopher, I know you're not listening, but I'm thinking about you and I hope you

36:14.300 --> 36:21.140
feel better soon also got went and got the DS with Matt today and I've been

36:21.140 --> 36:24.940
really enjoying that as well and Benny Hana is one thing that Loki didn't say

36:24.940 --> 36:27.580
about Benny Hana that was only my second time there but you know what's really

36:27.580 --> 36:30.580
weird about when you go to Benny Hana when you go to most restaurants you sit

36:30.580 --> 36:33.900
at your own table right but at Benny Hana you kind of have to like share a

36:33.900 --> 36:37.220
table with other people because they sit like seven or eight people at the table

36:37.220 --> 36:41.180
because of the fact they only have so many chefs and so we got to share the

36:41.180 --> 36:44.700
table with this lesbian couple and their child it was so cute because the little

36:44.700 --> 36:49.020
baby was calling both of them mom and just made me happy you know I like

36:49.020 --> 36:54.760
seeing gay people you know that you know have kids and stuff anyway so I guess

36:54.760 --> 36:58.180
that's pretty much it for my week of my day not a not a whole lot exciting stuff

36:58.180 --> 37:04.300
to report at least that I can think of right now anyway so of course we want to

37:04.300 --> 37:07.740
talk a whole lot about Ultramix too we want to get your input over the

37:07.740 --> 37:13.460
Skypline, if you go over to www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on interact with us, we're gonna take

37:13.460 --> 37:16.900
some of your calls in a little bit, but first let's go to a break, we still have a lot of

37:16.900 --> 37:19.860
music going on to play for you guys tonight, as I said earlier in the show, we've got so

37:19.860 --> 37:24.200
many UltraMix 2 songs we want to debut for you guys tonight, I don't think anybody else

37:24.200 --> 37:29.460
has these right now, so we're playing them for you guys, and getting your thoughts on

37:29.460 --> 37:33.540
it as well over the Skypline, and we'll talk about UltraMix 2 when we come back from this,

37:33.540 --> 37:40.540
listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

38:03.540 --> 38:05.540
You know she's got everything

38:06.540 --> 38:08.540
That a woman needs

38:08.540 --> 38:10.540
To get a man

38:10.540 --> 38:11.540
Yeah, yeah

38:11.540 --> 38:13.540
How can she lose

38:13.540 --> 38:15.540
When she's with you?

38:15.540 --> 38:17.540
Thirty-six, twenty-four

38:17.540 --> 38:18.540
Thirty-six

38:18.540 --> 38:20.540
What a winning hand

38:20.540 --> 38:22.540
She's a brat

38:22.540 --> 38:24.540
How?

38:25.540 --> 38:27.540
She's mighty, mighty

38:27.540 --> 38:29.540
Just letting it all hang out

38:29.540 --> 38:31.540
She's a brat

38:31.540 --> 38:32.540
How?

38:32.540 --> 38:38.540
Yeah, she's the one, the only one, built like a knucklehead's arm, yeah

38:38.540 --> 38:55.540
I said good-bye, I said good-bye, I said good-bye, I said good-bye, I said good-bye, I said good-bye now

38:55.540 --> 38:59.540
Break House

38:59.540 --> 39:02.540
Yeah, she's a knife in my tack

39:02.540 --> 39:04.540
I just didn't at all hang out

39:04.540 --> 39:08.540
Break House

39:08.540 --> 39:10.540
Oh, that lady's back

39:10.540 --> 39:11.540
That's a fact

39:11.540 --> 39:12.540
Ain't holdin' nothin' back

39:12.540 --> 39:13.540
I don't give up

39:13.540 --> 39:18.540
He's out from the race house, yeah

39:18.540 --> 39:43.900
Let me tell you something you don't know

39:43.900 --> 40:11.900
Let me tell you somethin' you don't know Let me tell you somethin' you don't know

40:11.900 --> 40:26.900
Let me tell you something you don't know

40:26.900 --> 40:40.900
If you keep these secrets I will show

41:10.900 --> 41:12.900
I'm gonna make it

42:40.900 --> 42:57.900
Orange Lounge Radio. We put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.

42:57.900 --> 43:01.660
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio. Hope you enjoyed some of the music there in that

43:01.660 --> 43:06.900
break. All from Ultramix 2. We had a song, you should know this one, Brick House by the

43:06.900 --> 43:10.820
Commodore is finally making its way into a DDR game, that's a great one.

43:10.820 --> 43:14.500
After that was a group called Creo with a song called Burning For You, which is kind

43:14.500 --> 43:17.020
of a, I think it's one of the sleeper hits in the mix, honestly.

43:17.020 --> 43:18.020
It's one of those songs...

43:18.020 --> 43:19.280
Burn For You.

43:19.280 --> 43:22.000
It burns in your ears, like, after you hear it, but in a good way.

43:22.000 --> 43:25.460
I really like this song, it's like one of my, like, top three favorite songs in the

43:25.460 --> 43:26.460
mix, I think.

43:26.460 --> 43:28.800
I don't know, there's so many, I love all the poppy songs in the mix.

43:28.800 --> 43:29.960
I love them.

43:29.960 --> 43:31.240
Love them so much.

43:31.240 --> 43:37.480
And after that was Catch It by Total Science, which is a song I don't particularly care

43:37.480 --> 43:38.640
for so much.

43:38.640 --> 43:44.000
And Dark Sakura is discovering the wonders of PictoChat with Loki on the DS right now.

43:44.000 --> 43:45.000
What are you guys drawing pictures of?

43:45.000 --> 43:47.120
My artwork is pretty damn good on this thing.

43:47.120 --> 43:48.660
I want to put it up on the cam.

43:48.660 --> 43:50.200
You can try, but it looks really blurry.

43:50.200 --> 43:54.240
I can go try to put it up on the cam, but you're going to have to chat while I do it.

43:54.240 --> 43:55.240
Okay.

43:55.240 --> 44:00.120
You need to...

44:00.120 --> 44:02.120
I drew a picture of a toilet.

44:06.120 --> 44:07.120
You can barely see it.

44:07.120 --> 44:09.120
Yeah, you can barely see it, but it's coming out okay.

44:10.120 --> 44:12.120
Look, he sent me a picture of a turd.

44:12.120 --> 44:14.120
And I sent him a picture of my horse.

44:15.120 --> 44:18.120
And he sent me a picture of glue, and I sent him a picture of a toilet.

44:21.120 --> 44:23.120
Here, take that thing, take that foul thing back.

44:23.120 --> 44:24.120
I'm supposed to be doing my homework.

44:24.120 --> 44:32.120
I was going to say, I found a way to distract DarkSakra from her homework, show her PictoChat.

44:32.120 --> 44:38.120
And now Loki is repeatedly sending me pictures of him holding a gun, shooting RVGL children.

44:38.120 --> 44:43.120
That's like the third one he sent. Alright, I'm turning this off. We've got a show to do.

44:43.120 --> 44:51.120
I'm really scared about the next, like, anime con, or better yet, DDR tournament, with all these DS's.

44:51.120 --> 44:55.520
There's going to be like, every kid on the block is going to have their DS there and

44:55.520 --> 44:57.760
drawing naughty pictures back and forth.

44:57.760 --> 45:03.340
Did you like how there's a big old warning in the DS manual about parents, you should

45:03.340 --> 45:10.880
advise your children if they're under 15 about the warnings of chatting with strangers.

45:10.880 --> 45:16.800
When picking a name, make sure it's gender of, what was it, gender neutral.

45:16.800 --> 45:18.520
I didn't understand the reasoning behind that.

45:18.520 --> 45:19.520
I guess that's so that.

45:19.520 --> 45:21.520
Dirty old man can't pick up on you.

45:21.520 --> 45:22.520
With a DS.

45:22.520 --> 45:26.520
Seriously, if you're a dirty old man hitting on girls on a DS, you're sad.

45:26.520 --> 45:29.520
Desperation.

45:29.520 --> 45:30.520
Let's see, here it is.

45:30.520 --> 45:33.520
This is on page 10 of the manual.

45:33.520 --> 45:35.520
Important privacy information.

45:35.520 --> 45:40.520
Nintendo DS wireless communication, including PictoChat, is not monitored.

45:40.520 --> 45:42.520
In other words, they're saying this is not Xbox.

45:42.520 --> 45:46.520
This means PictoChat does not block messages from strangers.

45:46.520 --> 45:48.520
Similar to unmonitored internet chat rooms,

45:48.520 --> 45:51.840
children should be warned about receiving messages from or communicating

45:51.840 --> 45:57.400
with strangers. Up to 15 other DS users within range of your Nintendo DS may be

45:57.400 --> 46:00.760
able to view your nickname and messages within a selected chat room at any one

46:00.760 --> 46:04.480
time. I hope to God because we live in an apartment complex so there's four

46:04.480 --> 46:10.440
more buildings around here. There's kids over there, and they got video games. Mommy, mommy,

46:10.440 --> 46:22.920
gimme PicnoChat, gimme DS. Oh, I can't wait. Oh, hey, who's this chatting on here? Penis.

46:22.920 --> 46:27.640
And it goes on to say, an adult should assist children with a system setup and instruct

46:27.640 --> 46:32.280
them not to use personal information and not meet strangers. Okay, that's the part I don't

46:32.280 --> 46:36.320
get because how far does the DS work like it's only like 30 feet so chances

46:36.320 --> 46:41.040
are you're already by the stringer but not necessarily because 30 feet and I

46:41.040 --> 46:45.560
think that you can ping off of each other I think that would be something

46:45.560 --> 46:51.760
else yeah or give personal information to anyone because it could be read by a

46:51.760 --> 46:55.880
stranger so don't put your credit card number on pictochat okay well okay yeah

46:55.880 --> 46:59.960
okay 15 year olds don't put your credit card number your social security on a

46:59.960 --> 47:04.640
picked up chat you know wait wait wait wait I'm gonna let me be the first one

47:04.640 --> 47:11.560
to say this right now okay you're gonna see an article within I'm gonna give it

47:11.560 --> 47:16.600
like three months kids cut in school using the DS's to cheat on tests

47:16.600 --> 47:19.480
seriously you know what they could already do it though is cell phone text

47:19.480 --> 47:23.960
messaging I've already heard of that one in fact even because it's not a huge

47:23.960 --> 47:27.720
secret I'm a teacher in my day job except I teach adults and adults are

47:27.720 --> 47:33.000
just as bad as children but they use email they'll use their email system to

47:33.000 --> 47:38.680
email each other during tests I have to watch them it's sad not everybody it's

47:38.680 --> 47:42.840
I'm talking about one or two bad apples spoiling the bunch obviously exactly

47:42.840 --> 47:47.080
whatever date you choose to enter is your month or day of birth year is not

47:47.080 --> 47:51.960
asked for and it's your birthday message will be communicated in the chat room on

47:51.960 --> 47:59.920
that date. For more information, visit nintendo.com slash consumer slash dsprivacy. That's some

47:59.920 --> 48:01.840
good reading if you're ever really...

48:01.840 --> 48:06.640
I love how the little warning comes up every time you turn that on. Be sure to look into

48:06.640 --> 48:11.040
the health risks while playing the DS.

48:11.040 --> 48:16.400
DS causes cancer. No, I don't know. Anyway, back to the big Bomani news from this week.

48:16.400 --> 48:22.480
Ultramix 2, DDR Ultramix 2, hitting the Xbox. I know a lot of us have gotten a chance to

48:22.480 --> 48:27.680
play it on yesterday, 20 November, during the special, and some of us have been playing

48:27.680 --> 48:31.440
it throughout the weekend. Loki, what'd you think of Ultramix 2 overall?

48:31.440 --> 48:38.640
It was good. It was definitely a good mix of, you know, basically it's almost all new

48:38.640 --> 48:44.960
stuff anyways. And they did a really good job on it, really good job putting it together.

48:44.960 --> 48:53.960
I was under the impression that there'd be more actual videos for these songs, like, you know, not this random shit, but eh, it's okay.

48:55.960 --> 49:07.960
But the steps seemed pretty good. Really, I didn't have any complaints about it, except maybe bomb mode was kind of stupid.

49:07.960 --> 49:23.960
Some of the extra party stuff is kind of, eh, whatever. It's different. That's pretty much all it is, yeah. I like it so far, though.

49:23.960 --> 49:24.960
What about Songlist?

49:24.960 --> 49:35.960
Songlist was very good. I like all this stuff that you haven't heard before, like the new remixes and stuff from Different Drum. Very good decision there.

49:35.960 --> 49:42.120
Whoever decided to hook up with a different drum for the songs bless you bless your little heart a million times over

49:42.120 --> 49:44.120
That was the most genius idea for DDR

49:44.280 --> 49:50.640
Seriously, that was as good as the original idea to hook up with Toshiba EMI in Japan for dance mania

49:50.640 --> 49:55.960
And I know I've said it on this show before that all DDR needed was to hook up with another record label

49:55.960 --> 50:00.220
Just like Toshiba EMI in Japan hook up with a record label here and get some good songs and thank God

50:00.560 --> 50:03.800
Somebody finally listened. Of course. I know they probably weren't really listening to me

50:03.800 --> 50:08.800
me, but somebody else thought of the idea, and hooray, it had great effects on DDR. I

50:08.800 --> 50:15.120
think the different drum stuff is the best music in the game. Anyway, Arkadian, what

50:15.120 --> 50:20.320
are your thoughts on UltraMix 2 being a DDR, mostly import, fanatic, but how do you like

50:20.320 --> 50:21.320
this domestic release?

50:21.320 --> 50:26.320
Yeah, it was pretty good. I would definitely say it was probably the best US mix that I've

50:26.320 --> 50:29.520
I've seen. Yeah, probably is the best US mix.

50:29.520 --> 50:32.020
Yeah, a lot of cool new stuff.

50:32.020 --> 50:37.020
Actually, I saw on some of the videos for the new stuff, they have, like, the website of the people.

50:37.020 --> 50:38.420
Some people that did them.

50:38.420 --> 50:40.020
And a lot of this stuff is pretty good.

50:40.020 --> 50:42.920
I'd want to actually check out the bands that did them.

50:42.920 --> 50:46.320
Which I'm sure if any bands ever heard that, they'd be very happy to hear that.

50:46.320 --> 50:49.120
You know, having their songs in DDR gets them the extra exposure.

50:49.120 --> 50:52.320
I mean, honestly, never heard Echo Image.

50:52.320 --> 50:54.620
Never heard of them before they were in UltraMix 2.

50:54.620 --> 50:58.240
And now I am a huge fan of them. I know most of the people that do this show

50:58.240 --> 51:02.320
I know we've gotten tons of listeners in on that band. I mean, it's great

51:02.320 --> 51:05.720
I mean, it's been great promotion for not just them but the other bands, too

51:05.720 --> 51:09.180
I know there's a lot of day behavior fans and stuff too. So but

51:09.720 --> 51:11.720
anyway

51:11.920 --> 51:13.480
Yes, Jamie

51:13.480 --> 51:15.760
Nothing. I just don't think the sentence makes sense. Oh

51:15.760 --> 51:23.760
It was Mr. Sucker's contention that this violated the implied warranty of merchantability.

51:23.760 --> 51:25.760
Does that sound correct?

51:25.760 --> 51:27.760
It's big words, but it sounds fine to me.

51:27.760 --> 51:32.760
I didn't mean to interrupt the Vimani discussion. I just had an agonizing moment over my own grammar.

51:32.760 --> 51:34.760
Have you gotten a chance to play Ultramix 2 at all?

51:34.760 --> 51:37.760
No. I haven't had a chance to do anything.

51:37.760 --> 51:41.760
You'll have a chance before next week's show, hopefully.

51:41.760 --> 51:48.360
Well, I'm hoping to get some time and, um, of course, um, it's probably going to be after

51:48.360 --> 51:49.360
I get back from Aladamma.

51:49.360 --> 51:50.360
Gotcha.

51:50.360 --> 51:53.360
But, I've had other priorities.

51:53.360 --> 51:54.360
Fair enough.

51:54.360 --> 51:55.840
Balmani can't always come first.

51:55.840 --> 51:57.240
Well, it could.

51:57.240 --> 52:02.760
I left work early on Friday and ran over to GameCrazy to try and find the game and all

52:02.760 --> 52:03.760
they had was the bundles.

52:03.760 --> 52:04.760
Hiss!

52:04.760 --> 52:05.760
Hiss!

52:05.760 --> 52:07.160
All they had were the bundles, so I went over to Gamestop instead.

52:07.160 --> 52:08.160
Good.

52:08.160 --> 52:09.160
Go to Gamestop first.

52:09.160 --> 52:10.160
You make me cry.

52:10.160 --> 52:12.160
It's just the GameStop people are always hounding me.

52:12.160 --> 52:14.160
Then go to the one of our Danvers!

52:14.160 --> 52:16.160
It's too far of a drive!

52:16.160 --> 52:18.160
Well then tell me and I'll go.

52:18.160 --> 52:19.160
Fine.

52:19.160 --> 52:20.160
Okay.

52:20.160 --> 52:21.160
Alright.

52:23.160 --> 52:24.160
I'm crying!

52:24.160 --> 52:26.160
No you're not. No you're not.

52:27.160 --> 52:29.160
Anything else you want to say about UltraMix 2 Arcadian?

52:29.160 --> 52:31.160
Yeah, and the backgrounds are seizureific.

52:31.160 --> 52:37.160
And if you play it for like over an hour or so, you'll start to get a headache if you have those on.

52:37.160 --> 52:40.680
because I know I was after playing like two hours

52:40.680 --> 52:45.200
to play a bit more after we left, my head was starting to hurt.

52:45.200 --> 52:50.120
It helped to have these classes that are not the best.

52:50.120 --> 52:55.340
I disagree actually. I think in the past three days I've played more

52:55.340 --> 52:59.720
DDR than I have since I like first got into the game or like I would say after

52:59.720 --> 53:01.320
fourth mix was new in arcades.

53:01.320 --> 53:05.520
Huh?

53:05.520 --> 53:07.520
Oh no, I have that 7-up sub.

53:07.520 --> 53:09.520
Um, sorry about that.

53:09.520 --> 53:15.520
I've played more DDR in the past three days than I have since I first probably played fourth or fifth mix, honestly.

53:15.520 --> 53:17.520
That's how much I'm into this mix.

53:17.520 --> 53:23.520
And I haven't had a seizure yet, but I agree that the backgrounds are really bright and it makes sudden mode very difficult.

53:23.520 --> 53:25.520
I had a seizure yesterday.

53:25.520 --> 53:26.520
What?

53:26.520 --> 53:27.520
I'm kidding.

53:27.520 --> 53:32.720
seem to try to throw as much shit on the screen as possible so you'll screw up and miss the

53:32.720 --> 53:37.340
arrows. Like, you'll lose an arrow in all the busyness of the screen.

53:37.340 --> 53:42.800
And in challenge mode, that can be a bitch. You can turn the videos off, people.

53:42.800 --> 53:49.800
I know, but it's not as much fun that way. What was up with rage? First off, having ginormous

53:49.800 --> 53:56.560
hair, and second, dancing like a fucking woman. Well, it did in fourth mix.

53:56.560 --> 53:58.560
He had Emmys dances!

54:26.560 --> 54:31.600
what Loki oh the tournament we did on 20 November yeah unfortunately not a whole

54:31.600 --> 54:37.720
lot of people on Xbox Live just yet we tried doing a big tournament on Xbox

54:37.720 --> 54:42.400
Live yesterday and we managed to finally get four people a four-person tournament

54:42.400 --> 54:45.840
it was awesome but here's my advice to you guys that played the tournaments on

54:45.840 --> 54:49.840
Xbox Live change the song or else you'll play the whole song the whole tournament

54:49.840 --> 54:53.320
it was get it all we ended up playing get it all through the whole tournament

54:53.320 --> 54:56.640
which is kinda nice because in a way was kinda funny because

54:56.640 --> 55:00.460
you usually don't play the song pack games on live that much but

55:00.460 --> 55:04.720
I don't know I think with the new lobby system Ultramix 2 changed the whole

55:04.720 --> 55:08.940
live interface where you have the lobby now and you go back to the lobby once

55:08.940 --> 55:10.200
you finish the game it just

55:10.200 --> 55:13.580
just doesn't end the game and everybody goes off their own direction so I think having

55:13.580 --> 55:17.020
that lobby allows you to see if people have song packs and stuff and it's much

55:17.020 --> 55:17.720
easier for

55:17.720 --> 55:21.980
getting to play some of those songs on Xbox Live. And speaking

55:21.980 --> 55:26.380
of song packs. Song pack 7 is on the way out

55:26.380 --> 55:29.620
and we know some of the songs are going to be in that. A lot of classic DDR songs.

55:29.620 --> 55:32.100
Everything from end of the century to era. And a brand new song

55:32.100 --> 55:35.660
I feel the junk circuit mix. But unfortunately

55:35.660 --> 55:39.020
from what we understand the song pack has been submitted

55:39.020 --> 55:42.980
but it has not been added by Microsoft yet. Which is the case

55:42.980 --> 55:46.420
has been the case for a lot of previous song packs from DDR UltraMix so

55:46.420 --> 55:47.280
hopefully soon.

55:47.280 --> 55:51.340
Probably I would honestly check Monday because I bet you Microsoft will add them on

55:51.340 --> 55:58.000
Monday we'll see we shall see as far as my personal thoughts on the mix like I

55:58.000 --> 56:01.480
said I've played this game more in the past three days than any DDR mix in a

56:01.480 --> 56:07.320
long long time I really like it I love the fact that now it feels like DDR is

56:07.320 --> 56:13.760
not just being copies of Japanese mixes and by that I mean like you know how

56:13.760 --> 56:17.800
like when you run a copy on the copier and then you copy it again like Alex

56:17.800 --> 56:21.160
kind of starts to lose a little bit of quality you get some new things on there

56:21.160 --> 56:25.840
some new little lines and smidges and stuff but it's not the same you know

56:25.840 --> 56:29.440
what I mean so it's kind of been interesting to see this be really the

56:29.440 --> 56:33.000
first mix that wasn't going to be compared and everything else I even

56:33.000 --> 56:36.440
think with UltraMix 1 a lot of people were saying oh it's just max on the

56:36.440 --> 56:39.880
Xbox but with UltraMix 2 I think a lot of people really didn't know what to

56:39.880 --> 56:44.240
expect it got slammed a lot after e3 because the interface was kind of weird

56:44.240 --> 56:48.840
and you know the song list was not all that hot at the time because they were

56:48.840 --> 56:52.840
keeping all the good stuff under wraps, but boy, when they hooked up with a different

56:52.840 --> 56:57.880
drum and got all the new songs, it's just absolutely amazing. And the Xbox Live stuff,

56:57.880 --> 57:05.120
the phenomenal, having the edit steps online is great. I would say the only downsides I've

57:05.120 --> 57:12.800
seen so far to the game is maybe, I'm still noticing some frame rate issues in some songs.

57:12.800 --> 57:15.360
It's not a huge deal.

57:15.360 --> 57:17.000
No, it's a big deal.

57:17.000 --> 57:20.040
With the videos running, it is

57:20.040 --> 57:25.420
laggy as fuck. I mean, the frame rates drop pretty bad.

57:25.420 --> 57:28.800
And I'm surprised with it being, you know, a final product that

57:28.800 --> 57:30.720
it's having this problem.

57:30.720 --> 57:35.180
I mean, there are some serious frame rate issues with this.

57:35.180 --> 57:38.040
But, you know, if that really bothers you, turn off the videos.

57:38.040 --> 57:40.220
And I'm sure it'll fix it.

57:40.220 --> 57:41.840
It doesn't bother me that much.

57:41.840 --> 57:56.840
It doesn't bother me that much, but what does bother me is that I don't know if it's my dance pad, so I can't really blame the game for this, but I'm having some problem hitting some steps, and it might be this weird dance pad, but I'm hearing the doubles kind of have some very finicky timing issues on it, but honestly, those are very minor things.

57:56.840 --> 58:02.840
I had trouble with the controller, too. I'd be hitting stuff, and it wouldn't register, so that was annoying.

58:02.840 --> 58:09.240
I think a lot of people were saying that they were a little concerned about the steps when

58:09.240 --> 58:12.900
they first heard that, oh, new people are making the steps, and it's, you know, long

58:12.900 --> 58:16.840
time DDR fans, and oh, who knows what that could be, and I think there were some people

58:16.840 --> 58:23.720
out there that were even dogging on it. Makers of another game were dogging on the DDR Ultra

58:23.720 --> 58:26.360
Mix 2 stuff. Which is really fucking unprofessional, excuse

58:26.360 --> 58:28.200
me. Well, yeah, we already discussed that in a

58:28.200 --> 58:33.080
previous episode, I'm not going to go there again, but I believe it was Cuttriss on DDR

58:33.080 --> 58:36.680
Freak said something about those folks are eating a nice slice of humble pie right now,

58:36.680 --> 58:40.240
and I thought that was a very good way of putting it, because people are just loving

58:40.240 --> 58:46.120
the steps. I honestly have not heard really bad things about the steps yet. Which, in

58:46.120 --> 58:50.880
every DDR mix, what's the first thing that people knock? The steps. Every DDR mix. But

58:50.880 --> 58:55.000
not this one so far. Granted, there's been a couple people saying, oh, you know, some

58:55.000 --> 58:58.920
of the songs are triple A-able and the timing window is meh, but that timing window and

58:58.920 --> 59:01.040
the steps aren't the same to me, you know?

59:01.040 --> 59:06.840
Clearly, the person that was working on Sound Pack 6 was not working on this game.

59:06.840 --> 59:08.440
And thank heavens for that.

59:08.440 --> 59:09.440
Yes.

59:09.440 --> 59:12.940
And it's been really neat to see the edit mode stuff online too, because some folks

59:12.940 --> 59:16.560
over from the DER Freak thread are already uploading all the ONI edits, I saw some of

59:16.560 --> 59:19.900
those on there, I downloaded a few of them, it was pretty cool.

59:19.900 --> 59:25.540
The only thing I had a problem with is they kind of tucked that away, you know, the whole...

59:25.540 --> 59:30.140
I agree it was not as easy to find as it should have been, but...

59:30.140 --> 59:35.340
And plus, I think it's kind of got a lousy setup the way that you download the songs

59:35.340 --> 59:39.480
because you have to have the person on your friends list, or they have to be in the top

59:39.480 --> 59:43.040
100, which right now isn't a problem, but once you get more than 100 people on there

59:43.040 --> 59:45.780
with edits, it's going to be hard to find people with edits.

59:45.780 --> 59:51.460
So I think that might be, it wasn't maybe the brightest way to do it, but maybe it was

59:51.460 --> 59:55.020
the only way they could. I don't know. It's better than nothing. It's better than nothing.

59:55.020 --> 01:00:00.220
It changes now another time. Or even later. I mean, who's to say you couldn't, you know,

01:00:00.220 --> 01:00:04.460
because they have, you know, where you can update your software and stuff.

01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:07.980
I don't know if I'd ever see that happening with UltraMix 2. I think they'll just do an

01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:12.700
UltraMix 3 and fix all those things. So we'll see.

01:00:12.700 --> 01:00:20.820
Well some of us are better than no one, so. Yeah. Alright. Well I'm going to go ahead

01:00:20.820 --> 01:00:24.420
and open up the Skype line if some folks want to comment on UltraMix 2. You can go ahead

01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:31.180
and give us a call. Just go over to www.orangelaungeradio.com and click on interact with us and you can

01:00:31.180 --> 01:00:35.460
give our show a call and let us know your thoughts on UltraMix 2 if you picked it up.

01:00:35.460 --> 01:00:39.100
Not the Japanese import games just yet. We'll get to those in a little while. I know some

01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:42.020
of you guys want to talk about Festival and the other stuff. We will get to those a little

01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:49.020
I just want to talk about Ultramix 2 right now. Favorite song so far in Ultramix 2? What do you think, Logie?

01:00:49.020 --> 01:01:04.020
Oh, man. I love the Midi Head remix of In My Eyes. That's my favorite. Second favorite, Monkey Punk.

01:01:04.020 --> 01:01:10.020
Which is funny because I remember somebody saying that Monkey Punk, somebody who heard these songs before we did,

01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:13.860
saying that Monkey Bong was not that great of a song. It's actually pretty funny. I enjoyed

01:01:13.860 --> 01:01:20.060
it. I like it because it just feels like Guitar Freaks. Arcadian, favorite song in the mix

01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:27.060
so far? I haven't heard them enough to really give a favorite. I like some of the new stuff,

01:01:27.060 --> 01:01:34.280
like the new sort of electronic type of stuff. Yeah, a lot of the different drum stuff. Anything

01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:39.640
that you've heard that you like so far? Jamie, anything you've heard yet?

01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:46.640
I haven't been overly displeased except for the ten Goku. That was just crappy.

01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:54.280
Jonas, anything you... Well, I haven't really heard much of the songs,

01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:59.280
but some of the stuff I would consider my favorite so far, until I actually play the

01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:04.080
game, would be like Jam On It, or... The booty ones.

01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:09.640
Or Burn For You. Yeah, those are my top two so far.

01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:15.520
Gem on, it's fun. I would say my top three, Skulk, Love Skulk, Love Skulk, Wherever You

01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:22.520
Are by Lava, and Tough Enough by Vanilla Ninja. Love that song, and the video is cheesy-riffic.

01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:26.580
Love Skulk, but hate the cut of Skulk.

01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:28.080
You're kind of mad because they took out the vocals.

01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:31.080
Horrible edit of Skulk, but other than that, it's alright.

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:34.080
Once you hear the original, you're just like, ugh.

01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:42.080
You know what? I don't know so much, because the part with the female vocals is my favorite part of the whole song, and that's in there, so I'm okay with the cut that they use.

01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:46.080
I agree it's kind of sad that the male vocal could be in there too, but I don't know how they could have cut it.

01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:54.080
But they need to definitely make sure that this... Stick with a different drum for the next mix. That's what I think.

01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:55.080
Seriously.

01:02:55.080 --> 01:03:00.480
establish yourselves with a different drum because obviously it's bringing

01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:06.960
them a lot of you know promotion and it's just you know it's a very good deal

01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:09.160
I think because you're gonna hear all these artists you've never heard before

01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:13.320
and you're kind of get these brand new artists you know coming out just because

01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:16.960
of this I'm looking at the chat room some folks in the chat room are

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:20.220
answering the question there iguana girl says her favorite song is standing still

01:03:20.220 --> 01:03:24.000
in time also one of my favorites I keep I keep neglecting that one because it's

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.240
kind of an easier song so I don't play it so much because I kind of like sevens

01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:30.600
and that one's only like a five but that's a great song love that song too

01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:36.280
again different drum great song I see gyrus full tilt mix says dark Tetsuya

01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:40.760
his favorite song awesome video love the gyrus full tilt video because it

01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:47.120
actually has screens from the old-school gyrus and a lot of fun all right so

01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:51.680
anyway I guess we'll do is take a break then we're gonna come back and talk a

01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:56.080
little more about Ultramix 2. Looks like folks are shy tonight, don't really want

01:03:56.080 --> 01:04:00.280
to talk to us on the Skype line. That's fine, see if we care. That's just fine,

01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:04.320
we'll sit here and talk for you. So we're gonna go to some more Ultramix 2 songs

01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:07.280
because we promised we would play as many of these as we could for you guys

01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:10.880
tonight. We're gonna start it off with the other Day Behavior song. I know you

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:15.240
guys have heard a lot of Superstar, the Never Aca mix, but they have another song

01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:18.440
that's really good in Ultramix 2 and it's called Close Your Eyes. We're gonna

01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:25.440
start this break off with that song, and we'll be back.

01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:57.440
You and I together in the sky Forever young, we can never die

01:04:57.440 --> 01:05:03.440
Close your eyes Close your eyes and let us fly

01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:10.440
You and I Together we can touch the sky

01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:13.440
Close your eyes

01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:26.440
Close your eyes

01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:28.440
Close your eyes

01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:31.440
Close your eyes and let us fly

01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:33.440
You and I

01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:34.440
You and I

01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:38.440
Together we can touch the sky

01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:45.220
Close your eyes, close your eyes, Close your eyes and let us fly

01:05:45.220 --> 01:05:52.240
You and I, you and I Together we can touch the sky

01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:58.800
Close your eyes, close your eyes, Close your eyes and let us fly

01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:06.800
Fly, you and I Fly together, we can touch the sky

01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:58.480
Yes, smarty-cans, go ahead, find me something new right now, you're so smart, go ahead,

01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:00.480
I haven't heard

01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:18.480
I knew you were gonna want me, I knew you wanted me, It might be a different show on the way.

01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:33.480
And you, you're gonna want to, but you won't do, it might be a different story

01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:40.480
Keep your mind, keep your mind, keep your mind from falling way down

01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:43.980
And look, you're gonna want me

01:08:43.980 --> 01:08:45.980
Up when you want me

01:08:45.980 --> 01:08:48.480
It might be a different story

01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:50.980
Keep your body, keep your body

01:08:51.980 --> 01:08:54.980
Keep your body, all the way down

01:08:54.980 --> 01:08:56.900

easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song

01:09:53.360 --> 01:10:04.760
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 119 in progress.

01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:07.560
And somebody in chat said that they wanted to call on the Skype line, so I'm going to

01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:11.360
go ahead and open up the Skype line back one more time, see if we can get a call on there.

01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:15.240
So you can go ahead and call on our Skype line right now if you want, www.orangeloungeradio.com

01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:19.000
and click on interact with us.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.840
While waiting for that call, Loki has some exciting news he wants to share with you guys

01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:24.480
about something we've got set up for next week. Oh wait, nevermind, we're getting that

01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:27.020
call. We'll get back to that in a little bit. Hi, you're on Orange

01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:34.520
Honors Radio. Hey, Rob. Hey, who's this? Jazz. Hi, Jazz, how are you? I'm good, how are you?

01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:39.640
Good! So you've been playing a lot of UltraMix too? Of course. And what do you think so far?

01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:42.640
I think it's awesome. You think it's awesome? Now you're somebody, how long have you been

01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:50.120
playing DDR? 1999. 1999, and would you... You're old school like us. Would you like

01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:54.360
Now you don't have to agree with me, but would you say, along with me, that this is the best

01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:56.240
home mix they've ever released?

01:10:56.240 --> 01:10:58.740
Of course, yes, definitely.

01:10:58.740 --> 01:11:02.000
What is it that makes this mix so damn beautiful?

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:05.760
It's because they took it in a whole new different direction and gave us Americans something

01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:10.200
that hasn't been rehashed from Japan a million times over.

01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:11.840
It's the copy of a copy thing!

01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:12.840
Exactly.

01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:13.840
Exactly.

01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:17.040
I would say a different drum is the best thing that happened to Ultramix 2, honestly, my

01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:22.860
opinion, but, and Xbox Live, because I love Xbox Live. I never thought, I never thought

01:11:22.860 --> 01:11:26.300
two, three years ago, how long ago did Xbox first come out? Three years ago or so? I never

01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:30.020
thought I would be sitting here saying I actually love an Xbox game, but it's true. I have to

01:11:30.020 --> 01:11:31.020
eat my words.

01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:33.460
Yep. A lot of people are doing that.

01:11:33.460 --> 01:11:37.220
I know. So how's the competition going on Xbox Live? Aren't you ranked like number three

01:11:37.220 --> 01:11:39.420
or four right now on there?

01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:42.260
Something like that last time I checked. It's pretty easy.

01:11:42.260 --> 01:11:45.120
It's easy?

01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:49.280
Like the timing is really pathetic actually.

01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:52.320
I like triple A'd at least ten songs last night.

01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:53.320
I was so surprised.

01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:55.320
Yeah, I triple A'd ten songs.

01:11:55.320 --> 01:12:00.400
Okay, on the 20 November special yesterday, I was playing on light mode.

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:03.040
Now shut up, because I was actually on dance pad.

01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:07.040
I got one great on four songs in a row.

01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:08.040
Nice.

01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:10.040
I was so pissed off.

01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:14.040
That happened to me a lot on Heavy and I was really mad at that for a while.

01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:18.040
Listen, you and your DDR skills.

01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:22.040
Now, I don't know, any suggestions

01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:26.040
you would take to the Konami team for Ultramix 3 ideas?

01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:30.040
A lot more 2DX crossovers, a lot more B-Money crossovers.

01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:34.040
I didn't even know that something like Midnight Special was so awesome

01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:38.040
until I actually got to play it.

01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:43.320
and guitar freaks. Is it just me or does Sleepwalker sound like a total, is that the name that's

01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:45.640
on Sleepwalker? Does that sound like a total guitar freak song?

01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:49.200
It does. And the Boy Zone or whatever that other song

01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:55.480
was, what was that? Boy Jazz? No, Boy Zone is that you're a band, huh?

01:12:55.480 --> 01:12:58.400
Think it's something else. Euromix. That's Euromix.

01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:03.360
Yeah. Alright. Anything else you want to say?

01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:06.800
Not really, except come on people, practice, give me a challenge.

01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:14.200
Oh, a call, a call to those on Xbox Live challenge. What's your gamertag so folks can find you?

01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:15.440
Kamikaze cat.

01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:20.560
Kamikaze cat. Alright. Whoop some ass. Alright. Good luck to you.

01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:21.560
Alright, you too. Bye.

01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:26.260
Alright, later. Bye. Now what he doesn't know is I plan to take him over in the rankings

01:13:26.260 --> 01:13:29.260
very soon.

01:13:29.260 --> 01:13:38.380
Now maybe it's just me, but I honestly think that this DDR mix is so good that we seriously

01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:45.940
need to start hounding, and I don't mean like just writing letters and you know saying pretty

01:13:45.940 --> 01:13:52.400
please, I mean hounding Konami, everybody from every angle to let Konami of Hawaii do

01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:57.380
a new arcade mix and put a new arcade mix out there in America.

01:13:57.380 --> 01:13:58.680
Anybody else feel similarly at all?

01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:01.320
Or have you guys given up on DDR in the arcade?

01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:02.320
I don't know.

01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:03.320
Is it just me?

01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:08.740
Not necessarily a having given up, just no expectation really.

01:14:08.740 --> 01:14:12.300
That's kind of where I'm at right now, which is why it would be such a pleasant surprise

01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:14.280
to see a new arcade mix.

01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:18.460
And I think that with all this great music they're getting in DDR now, and just the way

01:14:18.460 --> 01:14:22.400
it's been presented, and the way the steps were done and everything, I think they've

01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:27.360
proven themselves that they can do a mix for America and make it really darn good.

01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:33.560
good, and it's not just something rehashed from Japan. And I think they need to do it.

01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:39.960
But maybe it's just me. I don't know. What could we do to get them to make a new mix,

01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:43.800
other than hounding them? I know we can't make anybody do anything, but how could we

01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:49.760
Hostile takeover! Hostile takeover. We'll buy 51 shares of their stock. That's a really

01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:54.380
good idea. Yeah, we could do that. Oh my God. Then we would, then as, and honestly as shareholders

01:14:54.380 --> 01:14:57.420
they would have we would have interest in the company's activity. That is a

01:14:57.420 --> 01:15:01.340
brilliant idea. Is Konami a publicly traded company

01:15:01.340 --> 01:15:04.940
though as Japanese? I do believe so actually. One second.

01:15:04.940 --> 01:15:10.860
Oh she's looking it up in the business law book. That's a really good idea.

01:15:10.860 --> 01:15:15.180
Oh man we should become Konami shareholders.

01:15:16.460 --> 01:15:21.740
That's a great idea Jamie. All right. All right Jamie's gonna look that up in

01:15:21.740 --> 01:15:29.680
in the business law book over there on what's going on with the possibility of buying shares

01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:30.680
in economy. Any other methods?

01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:35.040
Just check up and make sure to see what their corporate deal is.

01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:40.120
Okay. Any thoughts from you, Loki, about a new arcade mix? Haven't you been saying for

01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:44.280
a long time they need to do a new arcade mix? Now you're all of a sudden really quiet.

01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:48.680
Yeah, I've been saying that for a long time. No, the reason I'm quiet is because McDonald's

01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:57.060
kicking it that that wanting to die feeling I'm loving it I think I found it

01:15:57.060 --> 01:16:02.500
okay businesses have relationships with all sorts of people other than their

01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:06.200
stockholders including employees suppliers customers creditors in the

01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:10.140
local community aha under the stakeholder interest theory of social

01:16:10.140 --> 01:16:13.620
responsibility a corporation must consider the effects its actions will

01:16:13.620 --> 01:16:21.620
have on the other stakeholders. Interesting. So there may actually be a legal requirement

01:16:21.620 --> 01:16:30.020
okay, to satisfy those who have a stake in their activity. Not just their shareholders

01:16:30.020 --> 01:16:35.620
but also their customers. This is a great idea. I'm seriously going to look into buying

01:16:35.620 --> 01:16:40.380
Konami stock. You can just buy like 5, 10 shares of stock on E-Trade right? There's

01:16:40.380 --> 01:16:44.720
also this one here. For example, a corporation would violate the stakeholder interest theory

01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:50.480
if it viewed employees solely as a means of maximizing stockholder wealth. So, basically,

01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:55.080
they have to treat their employees well, of course. But also, that's not just saying that

01:16:55.080 --> 01:17:01.920
anyone who has an interest in the activity of the company, you know, if they're not meeting

01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:06.880
the majority interest, then they're actually violating that rule.

01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:10.560
So if you love Konami and you want to see them do right, put your money where your mouth

01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:13.060
is and buy a piece of them.

01:17:13.060 --> 01:17:14.520
I think it's a brilliant idea.

01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:16.300
I think that we should buy Konami stock.

01:17:16.300 --> 01:17:17.300
I'm going to do it.

01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:18.300
I'm going to look into it.

01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:19.300
I don't know.

01:17:19.300 --> 01:17:20.920
There's a business major in the chat room.

01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:23.580
Can you answer this for me?

01:17:23.580 --> 01:17:24.580
I know.

01:17:24.580 --> 01:17:25.680
Maybe we're just talking out our asses here.

01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:27.240
But in theory, it sounds like a good idea.

01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:28.240
It really does.

01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:29.240
I don't know.

01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:30.240
I mean.

01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:33.000
Oh, um, Zaku found the financial info.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:34.120
Oh, beautiful.

01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:35.120
Thank you, Zaku.

01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:36.120
Let's see.

01:17:36.120 --> 01:18:06.100
there over it. I think I might have misinterpreted some of this, but I mean, look at this. I mean, okay, granted, like, one person couldn't just buy, like, two shares and then expect to run the company. But if several people bought several shares that collectively had a say, they might listen to you. Maybe we should incorporate ourselves. Seriously. Oh, I think we need to do that anyway. Yeah, but, Orange Lawn Trading will not be a publicly traded company because nobody's going to tell us what to do. Exactly.

01:18:06.100 --> 01:18:08.100
He wouldn't make any money anyway.

01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:09.100
We'll be privately owned.

01:18:09.100 --> 01:18:12.100
There are earnings for this year.

01:18:12.100 --> 01:18:13.100
One dollar.

01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:14.100
In the negative.

01:18:14.100 --> 01:18:15.100
Beautiful.

01:18:15.100 --> 01:18:21.900
I'd like to thank my friend Julie who I'm on another form of chat that I'm not letting

01:18:21.900 --> 01:18:25.100
anybody know because I don't want them to send me messages all of a sudden.

01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:26.100
Alright.

01:18:26.100 --> 01:18:37.660
The site, if you're ready, is konami.com slash en slash ir slash, wait, another page popped

01:18:37.660 --> 01:18:38.660
up over it.

01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:39.660
Let me get the address again.

01:18:39.660 --> 01:18:40.660
Okay.

01:18:40.660 --> 01:18:50.580
It's konami.com slash en slash ir slash stockholder info, all one word, slash index dot html.

01:18:50.580 --> 01:18:53.820
And it actually goes back to investor relations.

01:18:53.820 --> 01:18:56.420
I posted that in our chatroom if folks are curious about that one.

01:18:56.420 --> 01:18:57.420
This is kind of cool.

01:18:57.420 --> 01:18:58.420
This is very interesting.

01:18:58.420 --> 01:19:02.740
This is a very interesting direction you've just kind of taken this program, Jamie.

01:19:02.740 --> 01:19:03.740
Very interesting.

01:19:03.740 --> 01:19:10.020
As of 19 November, K&M stock is $22.09 a share.

01:19:10.020 --> 01:19:11.380
Not too shabby.

01:19:11.380 --> 01:19:13.660
I could buy five shares of that.

01:19:13.660 --> 01:19:20.420
Maybe, maybe, maybe we as, you know, find out what would, how many, how many shares

01:19:20.420 --> 01:19:21.420
are available?

01:19:21.420 --> 01:19:22.420
I don't know.

01:19:22.420 --> 01:19:25.700
But, you know, maybe see about what it would be to...

01:19:25.700 --> 01:19:28.900
I don't know the first thing about playing the stock market.

01:19:28.900 --> 01:19:34.660
But as shareholders, though, we would have a right in our voice and how the company is

01:19:34.660 --> 01:19:35.660
right.

01:19:35.660 --> 01:19:36.660
You know, I...

01:19:36.660 --> 01:19:37.660
This is what it is for me.

01:19:37.660 --> 01:19:39.100
I love this game.

01:19:39.100 --> 01:19:42.880
My life has changed for the better in many ways because of this game, and I know that

01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:46.660
kind of sounds, you know, maybe sad to some people, but seriously, I've met a lot of great

01:19:46.660 --> 01:19:48.220
people because of this game.

01:19:48.220 --> 01:19:54.260
I've, you know, helped, I've started, along with Dark Sacra and Loki, a radio program

01:19:54.260 --> 01:19:58.620
which I love doing, you know, twice a week, and this game has done so much.

01:19:58.620 --> 01:19:59.620
I believe in this game.

01:19:59.620 --> 01:20:01.020
I want to see this game have a future.

01:20:01.020 --> 01:20:04.180
I'm going to put my money where my mouth is and buy a piece of it.

01:20:04.180 --> 01:20:08.420
One thing that I need to point out to, who is this, Primo Maggot, I guess?

01:20:08.420 --> 01:20:09.420
Okay.

01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:10.420
Lovely name.

01:20:10.420 --> 01:20:13.780
You can only buy as many shares that are available, too, for purchase because they are going to

01:20:13.780 --> 01:20:16.840
take certain interest to make sure that those takeover cases...

01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:18.280
person doesn't do a hostile takeover.

01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:21.400
Exactly, exactly. They have ways of making sure that you're not...

01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:24.460
But at any rate, even if you own one share,

01:20:24.460 --> 01:20:28.800
you have basically an interest in how the company operates.

01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:34.320
You have a right to say, I am not pleased with what you are doing. You have to listen to me.

01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:40.200
Not that I would say I'm not pleased with what they're doing, but I would say...

01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:43.480
But overall, I mean in general.

01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:46.640
You know, I'm disappointed in what you're doing.

01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:48.600
you know

01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:53.600
It's just a matter of you know you you would now actually as you have a full

01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:55.600
You know an interest in their activity

01:20:55.680 --> 01:21:00.400
Not just an interest as a consumer, but an interest as someone who was making money off of this company

01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:02.560
I think I think you got a great idea on your hands Jamie

01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:06.820
And I'm care it is worth the hundred bucks for five shares to find out honestly

01:21:06.820 --> 01:21:09.460
You know if really if you want to make your voice

01:21:09.460 --> 01:21:14.360
So you can write all the letters you want to until the cows come home until they're run over by a katamari, but

01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:20.820
But if you actually go out, put the money down, and say, I have interest in your company,

01:21:20.820 --> 01:21:26.160
this is what I would like to see, then this is a real definite way to make your voice

01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:27.160
heard.

01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:28.160
Interesting.

01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:31.680
This is going to be very interesting to see where this goes.

01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:34.840
If anything becomes of this idea, I'm very curious to see what happens.

01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:35.840
We'll see.

01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:36.840
Lowkey, you have a comment?

01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:42.960
No, I was just thinking it would be cool if they had DDR for the DS.

01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:44.960
Second word.

01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:48.960
Anyway.

01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:50.960
Wow.

01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:54.960
Now the chat room is running away with this idea.

01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:59.960
Zaku says, I propose every DDR player in the country over the age of 18 buy at least one share of Konami stock.

01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:04.960
Maybe pulling legs there, but if you could get a large amount of them to, you could.

01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:08.960
And then Primo Maggot says, and then show up at Konami's shareholder meeting.

01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:14.960
You know what? I'm actually seriously considering doing it.

01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:20.560
Look at this, Jamie. Your school and now this are coming together. You can apply this business

01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:22.040
law knowledge your professor would be so proud of.

01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:24.480
Even though I changed my major and the class is no longer required?

01:22:24.480 --> 01:22:28.560
That's all right. You would still make your professor proud. Do you want to send a copy

01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:34.880
of this program or do we say fuck too much?

01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:37.080
I think we say fuck a bit too much.

01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:43.480
Did they allow me to come in wearing, you know, an eyepatch and a pirate bandana during

01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:44.480
the shareholders meeting?

01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:45.480
Okay.

01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:47.800
I'm not gonna do a hostile takeover.

01:22:47.800 --> 01:22:54.200
Okay, honestly, if you want to be taken seriously, if you want this idea to be taken seriously,

01:22:54.200 --> 01:23:01.080
no you can't come to the shareholder meeting dressed like a pirate.

01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:03.200
But I think hell no we won't go would be okay.

01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:05.200
No, I don't know.

01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:10.800
Very interesting. Alright, well, to be continued, I'm gonna do some-

01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:13.600
I play party games, come on, what were you thinking?

01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:19.240
I've got, I've got a lot of time off work this week, thanks to Thanksgiving, and uh-

01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:23.900
I have a lot of time off during work, thanks to my work.

01:23:23.900 --> 01:23:27.200
So now, I, now it's on.

01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:31.680
Julie suggested we insert bleep for fuck.

01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:34.200
No way, I'm not gonna bleeping censor myself. Alright.

01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:41.200
Sleep you buddy!

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:46.040
Alright, let's get to, let's change topics completely, something we haven't

01:23:46.040 --> 01:23:48.640
talked about a whole lot tonight, but damn, it's a big deal.

01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:51.780
What? Where are we gonna be talking? Oh yeah, okay, sorry, Loki.

01:23:51.780 --> 01:23:55.760
We're gonna do the Kiryamoka giveaway very soon, but Loki, you have an

01:23:55.760 --> 01:23:57.480
announcement you want to talk about.

01:23:57.480 --> 01:24:01.600
Anyways, as we were mentioning earlier about, you know,

01:24:01.600 --> 01:24:04.720
how we were going to have conception on the show and

01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:09.120
conception out there with waldo

01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:13.080
in the meantime we were talking with another artist out there and i think we

01:24:13.080 --> 01:24:14.900
mentioned on the other show

01:24:14.900 --> 01:24:16.360
next week

01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:17.900
on orange silence radio

01:24:17.900 --> 01:24:19.920
coming to you live

01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:23.420
the guy behind one of the best remixes i think in

01:24:23.420 --> 01:24:24.540
this new

01:24:24.540 --> 01:24:28.400
uh... ultra mix 2 and neddr honestly

01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:31.280
midi head will be on the show

01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:32.680
Awesome.

01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:35.020
And Midyhead is not just a guy that does

01:24:35.020 --> 01:24:39.380
DDR songs either. No, he's done a lot of stuff that you probably heard but didn't know was him.

01:24:39.380 --> 01:24:40.460
He's done music

01:24:40.460 --> 01:24:44.080
for Ryan Seacrest's show that's no longer on air. Okay, let's get past that.

01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:47.620
He's done music for Alias.

01:24:47.620 --> 01:24:50.340
There's a bunch of other shows on there. She-Spies.

01:24:50.340 --> 01:24:56.720
He did actually one of the trailers for the Matrix Revolution...

01:24:56.720 --> 01:24:59.080
Reloaded, I should say, one of the songs

01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:03.580
that I entered in Cage Mash and didn't win, but that's okay. Um, and um, just a bunch

01:25:03.580 --> 01:25:08.520
of other stuff. Um, I think there's some other games also, but I don't remember offhand.

01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:11.160
But yeah, he will be on the show next week.

01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:14.160
I'm looking forward to talking to Midyhead. We got a lot of good questions for him too.

01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:19.740
I'm, I'm excited about that. So, now we'll have our first interview with a DDR artist.

01:25:19.740 --> 01:25:21.400
Hopefully. And this one will air!

01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:27.760
We'll see. Alright. Anyway. Okay, uh, as promised, so more to come on that. Just keep an eye

01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:33.600
on our website for more details on that. And if you guys have questions, um, for Midihead,

01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:38.160
you can send them in. We'll create a thread in our forums or you can ask questions live

01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:43.880
during next week's show. I can't eat this microphone I found out. Alright, anyway, let's

01:25:43.880 --> 01:26:01.720
Let's get to the other order of business tonight.

01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:09.200
That's right, it is time for the very first drawing in the Akira Yamaka signed CD giveaway.

01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:13.460
We've asked you questions Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday nights.

01:26:13.460 --> 01:26:17.940
You guys have entered and we're gonna pull a name out of the hat right now and find ourselves

01:26:17.940 --> 01:26:21.260
a winner right now live on air.

01:26:21.260 --> 01:26:25.100
Don't worry guys though if you didn't win this week, you got a whole nother chance.

01:26:25.100 --> 01:26:29.240
We're doing the whole thing, we're just rewinding and repeating next week.

01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:33.380
And you have a chance to win Monday night, Tuesday night, and Thursday night.

01:26:33.380 --> 01:26:36.380

01:26:36.380 --> 01:26:40.560
Randomness with Dark Sacro, and Thursday night, Outside the Box Gaming with myself.

01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:46.400
And remember, listen all three nights, you can enter three times if you listen all three

01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:47.400
times.

01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:50.840
And I realize one of those nights is Thanksgiving, but you know what, if I'm going to be here

01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:53.040
and do a show, we're going to do a drawing, dammit.

01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:55.280
Alright, so Jamie, you want to pick our winner?

01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:56.280
Do I want to?

01:26:56.280 --> 01:26:57.280
Alright.

01:26:57.280 --> 01:26:58.280
Sure!

01:26:58.280 --> 01:27:00.560
Alright, she's going to pick our winner, she's going to reach into the hat and pull out a

01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:01.560
Really?

01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:03.080
It's the Dr. Dick hat, I feel dirty.

01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:04.800
Yes, it's the Dr. Dick hat.

01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:09.040
Alright, hold on, we're going to, I'm going to mix it up.

01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:10.640
I want to caress the names.

01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:14.640
You can caress the lovely names and then pull one out of the hat and we're going to see who wins.

01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:28.640
Jazz!

01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:32.640
Jazz is the winner! Congratulations!

01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:33.640
Woo!

01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:36.640
Good job. He was the one that just called, too.

01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:37.640
Yay!

01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:42.080

01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:49.400

01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:09.880
All right.

01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:10.880
Is he even listening still?

01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:11.880
I don't know.

01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:14.880
He probably went back to playing UltraMix II, so he probably doesn't even know he won.

01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:17.880
He's all, huh?

01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:20.880
Yeah, he just goes, huh?

01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:22.880
He doesn't even know why he won.

01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:25.880
All right, well, he'll figure it out pretty soon.

01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:26.880
He figured it out.

01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:32.880
Oh, I guess the buffer, yeah.

01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:35.880
Yes, Jazz, you won.

01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:42.600
Anyways, alright, so he's gonna win that signed Kiryamoka, what is this here, a mini disc

01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:47.120
from Silent Hill 4 The Room, it's a Japanese CD, here I'm gonna, we'll put this on cam

01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:49.360
too, and it's signed by a Kiryamoka.

01:28:49.360 --> 01:28:53.160
Again, if you didn't win tonight, try again this week.

01:28:53.160 --> 01:28:58.680
And he gets the special copy that I scraped with iron wool.

01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:01.120
No you did not, quit lying, quit lying.

01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:03.360
But maybe we'll send Jazz some other Orange Lawn Fries as well.

01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:10.120
are speed grooves. Oh, that'd be cool. Jamie's going to try and scan it so we can get a picture

01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:13.280
in. We'll do that with the other disk that we're going to give away this next week. I

01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:15.960
can try and put this on cam, but I don't think it's going to turn out very well. Let me try.

01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:26.960
There's speed grooves to make it play faster. Jamie, you know what we've missed? What? The

01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:28.960
The ferrets.

01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:30.960
I'm sorry, listeners.

01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:32.960
Give me the babies!

01:29:32.960 --> 01:29:34.960
My ferrets.

01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:36.960
My ferrets.

01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:38.960
Hey, don't throw that at my paper.

01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:40.960
Babies!

01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:42.960
Sweet!

01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:44.960
Is this the retard baby?

01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:46.960
I think the retard baby is in the closet.

01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:48.960
Hey, this is my laptop, okay?

01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:50.960
Sorry.

01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:52.960
I throw like a girl, sorry.

01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:54.960
The retard one died of complications.

01:29:54.960 --> 01:29:58.960
It died as crap. Oh, somebody stapled this one. Somebody did an operation on this one.

01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:08.960
That was mine, because I had to, yeah, because the geniuses that made those ferrets didn't put, like, any sort of, like, Velcro or zipper thing to put, you know, replace the batteries, so.

01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:16.960
Maybe we'll have to give away the retarded ferrets, which can be fixed by putting more batteries in, I think.

01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:22.960
All right. We're going to go to break, and when we come back, I want to talk a little bit about some of those other releases that came out tonight.

01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:26.560
stuff that I know nothing about so I'm gonna try and call somebody over the

01:30:26.560 --> 01:30:30.460
skype line to kind of talk about it a little bit but in the meantime we're

01:30:30.460 --> 01:30:35.560
gonna go to a break with some more music from ultramix 2 DDR and then the cage

01:30:35.560 --> 01:30:39.080
match as well I spy is the first song we're gonna hear in this break as well

01:30:39.080 --> 01:30:46.080
as I'm in Heaven and Istanbul Cafe. We'll be back.

01:31:39.080 --> 01:31:41.080
Come on, man! Come on, man!

01:32:39.080 --> 01:32:57.440
Don't wanna be the one to tell you how I feel When these feelings I have really are for

01:32:57.440 --> 01:33:01.000
real The time is right for this, a love to shine

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:05.200
on through But you gotta tell me what you wanna do

01:33:05.200 --> 01:33:11.200
I'm in heaven with you

01:33:13.200 --> 01:33:19.200
I'm in heaven with you

01:33:21.200 --> 01:33:26.200
I'm in heaven with you

01:35:26.200 --> 01:35:47.120
Hey, did you hear about that show?

01:35:47.120 --> 01:35:48.120
What show?

01:35:48.120 --> 01:35:51.240
Well, they play a lot of great Bimani and video of East game music, but if you listen

01:35:51.240 --> 01:35:53.360
to it, you have to listen to it again within seven days.

01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:55.120
Oh, I've heard of that station.

01:35:55.120 --> 01:35:56.120
Really?

01:35:56.120 --> 01:35:58.120
Yeah, I even listened to it a couple weeks ago.

01:35:58.120 --> 01:36:01.120
Hey, what happens to you if you don't listen to it again?

01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:02.120
Well, you die.

01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:03.120
I what?

01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:04.120
Hey!

01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:05.120
Wait!

01:36:05.120 --> 01:36:10.120
What's this crazy bitch doing coming out of my computer screen?

01:36:10.120 --> 01:36:14.120
Orange Lounge Radio, listen or die!

01:36:14.120 --> 01:36:17.120
Seven days.

01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:19.120
We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:22.120
We just heard some more songs from DDR Ultra Mix 2.

01:36:22.120 --> 01:36:23.120
Yay, Jazz!

01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:24.120
Including I Spy.

01:36:24.120 --> 01:36:25.120
I'm so excited.

01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:27.520
I'm in Heaven and Istanbul Cafe.

01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:29.820
I'm so excited! I'm so proud!

01:36:29.820 --> 01:36:32.820
He says he's contemplating giving it away as a Christmas gift. Isn't that cute?

01:36:32.820 --> 01:36:34.520
To me, well...

01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:35.720
Well, thank you.

01:36:35.720 --> 01:36:39.120
We'll see.

01:36:39.120 --> 01:36:44.020
He also is in our chat room right now and he says that Istanbul Cafe sounds like

01:36:44.020 --> 01:36:46.120
Exotic Ethnics' little brother.

01:36:46.120 --> 01:36:49.920
Which is kind of, yeah, it's kind of appropriate. I could see that. It's pretty cute.

01:36:49.920 --> 01:36:53.920
I love that song, I'm in Heaven, by the way. The one Jason Nevins featuring Holly James,

01:36:53.920 --> 01:36:57.420
which by the way is a former cage match winner from this very program

01:36:57.420 --> 01:37:00.460
uh... loki had picked that song in a cage match so

01:37:00.460 --> 01:37:03.500
so when we get to the cage match tonight just realized some of those songs may

01:37:03.500 --> 01:37:06.540
end up in a future version of DDR not that we have

01:37:06.540 --> 01:37:08.540
what? yeah you need a new song for cage match

01:37:08.540 --> 01:37:09.300
not that

01:37:09.300 --> 01:37:12.760
we have any pull whatsoever when it comes to DDR songs but you know we just

01:37:12.760 --> 01:37:14.620
have good taste and so does you know

01:37:14.620 --> 01:37:19.340
people that make DDR what can we say

01:37:19.340 --> 01:37:22.640
uh... also after all was one of uh... jamie's previous picks and then there's

01:37:22.640 --> 01:37:26.920
another song called Wherever You Are by Lava. That was one of my previous picks, so that's

01:37:26.920 --> 01:37:31.780
three songs, one from each of us. Pretty crazy. Alright, we are going to get to the cage match

01:37:31.780 --> 01:37:35.720
a little bit, but first off, I want to talk a little bit about 2DX8 style, because that's

01:37:35.720 --> 01:37:40.380
a huge thing that's coming out, right? Oh, it came out already in Japan. It's exciting

01:37:40.380 --> 01:37:44.480
because it has some 2DX Red songs that are unlockable in it, including Spiral Galaxy

01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:48.660
is one of the songs, and then there's these great new consumer songs. I definitely want

01:37:48.660 --> 01:37:53.020
play one of the new consumer songs for you, but first, I thought maybe we'd give somebody

01:37:53.020 --> 01:37:58.080
a call that knows a little bit more about this stuff than I do, because I haven't really

01:37:58.080 --> 01:38:02.820
been following the 8 style news. Jimmy, have you been following the 8 style news at all?

01:38:02.820 --> 01:38:08.940
Kinda, sorta, I honestly haven't had time. Low-key, have you at all? A little bit. Arkadian,

01:38:08.940 --> 01:38:14.420
I know you have a little bit, but... He's trying to find the mic. Yeah, a little bit,

01:38:14.420 --> 01:38:16.420
Yeah, I read a little bit of stuff, but...

01:38:16.420 --> 01:38:17.420
Sounds exciting for you here?

01:38:17.420 --> 01:38:18.420
Yeah, sounds pretty cool.

01:38:18.420 --> 01:38:23.420
Alright. Let's see what our buddy at DarkLionXVI has to say about 2DX.

01:38:23.420 --> 01:38:25.420
Have we talked to him about 2DX before?

01:38:26.420 --> 01:38:27.420
Hello?

01:38:27.420 --> 01:38:28.420
Hello, Sky.

01:38:28.420 --> 01:38:29.420
Hi, is this Ziggy?

01:38:29.420 --> 01:38:30.420
Yup.

01:38:30.420 --> 01:38:31.420
Hey, how you doing?

01:38:31.420 --> 01:38:32.420
Doing fine.

01:38:32.420 --> 01:38:33.420
Alright.

01:38:33.420 --> 01:38:34.420
Little bit anticipated.

01:38:34.420 --> 01:38:36.420
Where's your copy of 2DX8 style?

01:38:36.420 --> 01:38:39.420
Well, it's already in the UPS office here in Vegas.

01:38:39.420 --> 01:38:41.420
They won't deliver it until tomorrow.

01:38:41.420 --> 01:38:44.300
Don't you just want to go break in and get it?

01:38:44.300 --> 01:38:47.820
I don't think so. Not a good idea. He doesn't want to get busted.

01:38:47.820 --> 01:38:51.780
So tell us about some of the things we have to look forward to in 2DX8 style.

01:38:51.780 --> 01:38:57.700
The main menu's interface is like DDR Extreme US's Song Select Wheel.

01:38:57.700 --> 01:38:59.620
Really?

01:38:59.620 --> 01:39:05.300
Wait, it has the Song Select Wheel from EXUS? What?

01:39:05.300 --> 01:39:07.500
Wow, that's crazy. I didn't know about that one, huh?

01:39:07.500 --> 01:39:11.500
Does it have iToy support too?

01:39:11.500 --> 01:39:13.620
Okay, well that's good.

01:39:13.620 --> 01:39:16.680
What about some of the new unlocks, some of the new songs?

01:39:16.680 --> 01:39:18.340
About the unlocks thing,

01:39:18.340 --> 01:39:20.540
Spiral Gatsby and Taiyou.

01:39:20.540 --> 01:39:25.380
You can unlock them by playing all of the 8 style songs including the exclusives.

01:39:25.380 --> 01:39:27.620
However, there's a catch.

01:39:27.620 --> 01:39:29.460
Not use EZ.

01:39:29.460 --> 01:39:33.400
Oh, what happens if you do use EZ, you're screwed?

01:39:33.400 --> 01:39:37.100
You cannot be able to unlock it.

01:39:37.100 --> 01:39:41.480
interesting i have to be formal or hard mode okay well mental note to those you

01:39:41.480 --> 01:39:45.380
guys may get eight style don't play easy to unlock it

01:39:45.380 --> 01:39:48.060
and what about some of these consumer style songs

01:39:48.060 --> 01:39:49.820
well i haven't heard much

01:39:49.820 --> 01:39:53.680
even uh... everyday lovely day or nebula grasper i'm gonna try to get it tonight

01:39:53.680 --> 01:39:56.660
okay we're gonna play some of them actually here right after i'm done

01:39:56.660 --> 01:39:59.580
talking to you everyday lovely day

01:39:59.580 --> 01:40:02.580
i absolutely love everyday lovely day so we're gonna play that one we'll probably

01:40:02.580 --> 01:40:05.200
throw in nebula grasper as well because i know that's what a lot of people looking

01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:05.900
forward to

01:40:05.900 --> 01:40:11.900
LED looks like he's back. There were rumors that he left, but he came back. Do you know anything about that?

01:40:11.900 --> 01:40:15.900
No, I haven't been browsing around Vermont-y style about that.

01:40:15.900 --> 01:40:23.900
Huh. Alright, well. That's alright. I was just curious, because a lot of people were saying that LED had left, and now all of a sudden he's got all these songs again, so...

01:40:23.900 --> 01:40:26.900
If he did leave, he came back pretty quick. I don't know what happened there, so...

01:40:26.900 --> 01:40:40.900
And one more thing. On the records, it doesn't show the complete listings of your current scores, the progress. The economy somehow removes that.

01:40:40.900 --> 01:40:47.900
Huh. That's weird. Interesting. Like if you've beaten the song, or what?

01:40:47.900 --> 01:40:57.900
No, just like shows you just greats, greats, like the records of each individual songs, they might have taken that out.

01:40:57.900 --> 01:41:07.900
Weird. You're getting some feedback in the chat room there. Jason says, what does he mean the EX US song wheel? What do you mean by that? He said it's 8 style arcade authentic.

01:41:07.900 --> 01:41:14.900
Oh, let me try finding that picture. I know it's in Bimani style.

01:41:14.900 --> 01:41:20.100
He found a picture of it somewhere. Okay. Well, maybe are you sure it's just not a Photoshop because you know how some of those

01:41:20.620 --> 01:41:24.800
Some of those kids some of those kids over there love to Photoshop

01:41:25.780 --> 01:41:30.740
All right, we'll see. All right, so Siggy's gonna try and pull up that picture when you find that link

01:41:30.740 --> 01:41:33.320
Could you post it in chat room there for some folks that are?

01:41:33.980 --> 01:41:35.980
Really curious about what's going on there?

01:41:36.380 --> 01:41:41.900
Okay. Oh, here's the thing about AI NSB GL as of last Wednesday

01:41:41.900 --> 01:41:45.300
they have BeatMania 2DX11, 2DX Red on their machines.

01:41:45.300 --> 01:41:49.780
Oh, very cool. I want to go down to arcade. You know what? Sad, I'm going to be in LA

01:41:49.780 --> 01:41:56.140
tomorrow just for the day, but I'm not going to be able to go to Arcade Infinity, so I'm

01:41:56.140 --> 01:41:58.660
not going to be able to check it out for a while. But I do want to check the game out.

01:41:58.660 --> 01:41:59.660
We'll see.

01:41:59.660 --> 01:42:00.660
Mm-hmm.

01:42:00.660 --> 01:42:05.900
All right. Okay. Anything else exciting about 2DX Red that you've heard about? The new?

01:42:05.900 --> 01:42:19.900
Oh, by the way, on each style, whether regular or limited edition, you will get a goalie cover of a 2DX red e-amusement card featuring Darume and Tsunaru.

01:42:19.900 --> 01:42:23.900
Oh, cool. One of those little cards you can put... Oh, that's very cool. Alright.

01:42:23.900 --> 01:42:30.900
AI is working on their 2DX e-amusement readers.

01:42:30.900 --> 01:42:39.900
Okay. Is the EMU's thing, were there extra songs that were available on 2DX through the EMU's thing?

01:42:39.900 --> 01:42:41.900
I never really got...

01:42:41.900 --> 01:42:46.900
Oh, they're probably from the network.

01:42:46.900 --> 01:42:57.900
Oh, okay. I was just curious, because I know pop music usually has the EMAL songs that end up in the consumer style make releases, but not so much 2DX, so I'm just curious.

01:42:57.900 --> 01:43:01.900
Alright, anything else you want to share about what's going on in the 2DX world?

01:43:01.900 --> 01:43:03.900
Oh, here it is. I think I found a picture.

01:43:03.900 --> 01:43:04.900
Oh, okay, you found a picture.

01:43:04.900 --> 01:43:06.900
I'm going to post it over.

01:43:06.900 --> 01:43:12.900
Because our chat room is seriously going WTF, because some folks have played it and said it's arcade authentic, so...

01:43:12.900 --> 01:43:17.900
I had heard that the title screen was really weird, so maybe that has something to do with what's going on.

01:43:17.900 --> 01:43:19.900
Here's the picture. I've linked it.

01:43:19.900 --> 01:43:21.900
Okay.

01:43:21.900 --> 01:43:25.900
Alright, I'll have to take a look here. I gotta see this for myself here.

01:43:25.900 --> 01:43:29.900
Oh.

01:43:29.900 --> 01:43:33.900
Oh, interesting. The way it is kind of across the top.

01:43:33.900 --> 01:43:37.900
Oh, okay. That's kind of like, okay, kind of like the title screen. I see what you're

01:43:37.900 --> 01:43:41.900
talking about. Okay. That's what it is. That funky new menu, like the main menu

01:43:41.900 --> 01:43:45.900
where you choose like expert, beginner, how it kind of has that.

01:43:45.900 --> 01:43:49.900
This one's featured in the, I think the one right here on the picture right now, it's

01:43:49.900 --> 01:43:54.900
I mean, it's chosen as a dani ninte for a class course.

01:43:54.900 --> 01:43:58.900
Right. Very interesting. Okay, I'd heard that the title screen was a little different there.

01:43:58.900 --> 01:43:59.900
Okay, that makes sense now.

01:43:59.900 --> 01:44:00.900
Yeah, it's very different now.

01:44:00.900 --> 01:44:03.900
So, but once you get in and you pick the songs, it looks like 8th style.

01:44:03.900 --> 01:44:04.900
Mm-hmm.

01:44:04.900 --> 01:44:06.900
Well, that's good. That's good. And no iToy support.

01:44:06.900 --> 01:44:08.900
Yeah, I know.

01:44:08.900 --> 01:44:09.900
All right.

01:44:09.900 --> 01:44:15.900
And there's also a high-speed setting where you individually choose a song on which high-speed you want.

01:44:15.900 --> 01:44:20.900
I've heard about that. That's so good. Like in the expert courses and stuff, you can do a separate high speed for each song?

01:44:20.900 --> 01:44:21.900
You can do that too.

01:44:21.900 --> 01:44:30.900
Oh thank god. Because that needed that. Because I would hate having a non-stop course and then like I would have like Dune and then I'd have to do 250 BPM. Sucks.

01:44:30.900 --> 01:44:31.900
Expert mode.

01:44:31.900 --> 01:44:36.900
Yeah. Alright. Very cool. Anything else you want to share about 2DX? What's going on?

01:44:36.900 --> 01:44:39.900
Yeah, that's the only thing I can share more.

01:44:39.900 --> 01:44:45.900
When I do get my copy of Eight Style, I'll give you pictures, even a clip of me playing dance.

01:44:45.900 --> 01:44:48.900
Oh, yes, my favorite song. Alright, definitely.

01:44:48.900 --> 01:44:52.900
And we want to talk to you guys, or talk to you a little bit more, when I say you guys, I mean the listeners in general,

01:44:52.900 --> 01:44:55.900
about your thoughts on Eight Style when you get it, and we'll give you our thoughts as well.

01:44:55.900 --> 01:44:56.900
Alright?

01:44:56.900 --> 01:44:57.900
Yeah.

01:44:57.900 --> 01:44:59.900
Alright, well thanks for letting us bug you, Siggy. Have a good one.

01:44:59.900 --> 01:45:00.900
Alright.

01:45:00.900 --> 01:45:01.900
Alright, later.

01:45:01.900 --> 01:45:03.900
Alright, some information there on 2DX Eight Style.

01:45:03.900 --> 01:45:07.520
style. Scared everybody a little bit with that comparison to EX USA, but it looks like

01:45:07.520 --> 01:45:12.340
it's just the menu. Don't worry kids, everything else is still just the same. Don't freak out

01:45:12.340 --> 01:45:18.240
on me. Alright, speaking of 2DX8 style, there's some great new consumer songs. It's just so

01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:22.460
nice to see the return of consumer songs in 2DX. So we're gonna play a couple of those

01:45:22.460 --> 01:45:28.760
for you guys right now. My favorite song, Everyday Lovely Day, the LED style mix, I

01:45:28.760 --> 01:45:32.160
love this song, and Nebula Grasper, because that's a really popular one too. We're gonna

01:45:32.160 --> 01:45:39.160
play those songs and then we'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio. We'll be back.

01:47:32.160 --> 01:47:34.160
You

01:48:02.160 --> 01:48:07.160
tb

01:48:07.160 --> 01:48:12.160
tb

01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:17.160
tb

01:48:17.160 --> 01:48:22.160
tb

01:48:22.160 --> 01:48:27.160
tb

01:49:27.160 --> 01:49:41.560
And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, that was a preview of some songs from 2DX8

01:49:41.560 --> 01:49:47.880
Style, some new consumer tracks there, Everyday Lovely Day and Nebula Grasper.

01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:48.880
Very cool.

01:49:48.880 --> 01:49:54.480
Anyway, we are back and also being released this week, DDR Festival and Poppin' Music

01:49:54.480 --> 01:49:58.760
10. Don't know a whole lot about Poppin' Music 10 yet. I'm just, I'm not up on the

01:49:58.760 --> 01:50:01.880
Poppin' Music scene, to be honest, but I'm gonna try and get Navi back here on the show

01:50:01.880 --> 01:50:06.320
after he's gotten a chance to play the copy. I did hear the Akumajo Dracula medleys in

01:50:06.320 --> 01:50:10.040
it, which makes me very happy. That makes me go squeak. Yes. I guess it's one of the

01:50:10.040 --> 01:50:15.760
E-Mall songs that's in there, so it's very awesome, so. Ah. Happy, happy. Um, and then

01:50:15.760 --> 01:50:20.800
DDR Festival, AKA the catch-up to the USA mix, as some people are calling it. A chance

01:50:20.800 --> 01:50:26.540
to play a lot of Xbox only songs up until now on your PS2 is coming out, or it came

01:50:26.540 --> 01:50:30.640
out I should say in Japan, some folks are getting their copies. I notice a lot of people

01:50:30.640 --> 01:50:34.360
are doing a pass on it because, you know, it's very similar. Those folks that already

01:50:34.360 --> 01:50:38.680
have an Xbox figure there's not too much of a point, but for those people that don't have

01:50:38.680 --> 01:50:42.700
an Xbox, but they do have a JPS2, it's kind of a first chance for them to take a look

01:50:42.700 --> 01:50:47.960
at some new songs and also the new interface. So, you know, pretty good. Just pros and cons,

01:50:47.960 --> 01:50:51.320
just all depends on what you're looking for in a DDR mix so I'll bet you

01:50:51.320 --> 01:50:53.840
anything though whatever they release next year will have some of the Ultra

01:50:53.840 --> 01:50:58.400
Mix 2 stuff in it we'll see I could be wrong wouldn't be the first time we'll

01:50:58.400 --> 01:51:03.180
see all right anyway I think it's time boys and girls to get into the Orange

01:51:03.180 --> 01:51:11.780
Lounge Radio cage match what do you guys think sure they say of course I got to

01:51:11.780 --> 01:51:20.160
our song up here. Maybe we should get a new song besides Holik. No. Okay, DXY. No, we'll

01:51:20.160 --> 01:51:23.540
use Holik. I was just teasing. We don't really have to change that. Well, replace the Taku

01:51:23.540 --> 01:51:34.840
song with the Taku song. Taco? Last week in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage match, I took

01:51:34.840 --> 01:51:39.640
a risk by putting in a top 40 song. And what do you know, it worked. You guys voted it

01:51:39.640 --> 01:51:44.920
at the winner it was Gwen Stefani and the name of the song is what you waiting

01:51:44.920 --> 01:51:48.800
for and that was last week's winner remember the way the cage match works

01:51:48.800 --> 01:51:53.040
you hear a clip of last week's winner and two brand new songs in their

01:51:53.040 --> 01:51:56.760
entirety as chosen by the orange lounge radio host and then you vote on your

01:51:56.760 --> 01:51:59.840
favorite in our chat room and the winning song goes in a rotation all week

01:51:59.840 --> 01:52:04.400
long on orange lounge radio live all right so here we go let's start it off

01:52:04.400 --> 01:52:08.420
with song number one tonight it's a clip of Gwen Stefani with what you waiting

01:52:08.420 --> 01:52:15.420
for.

01:52:38.420 --> 01:52:42.960
Oh, watch your body, watch your body, watch your body, watch your body, watch your body

01:52:42.960 --> 01:52:44.740
Let's go

01:52:44.740 --> 01:52:48.720
Oh, take a, take a, take a, take a, take a break

01:52:48.720 --> 01:52:52.180
Take a chance to dig it out

01:52:52.180 --> 01:52:55.560
Looking like a failure repeating itself

01:52:55.560 --> 01:52:59.200
You know it all by heart, why are you standing in one place?

01:52:59.200 --> 01:53:02.680
A moon to floss, a moon to carry

01:53:02.680 --> 01:53:06.260
You're moving on because of your thoughts from the zone

01:53:06.260 --> 01:53:09.660
I know it's famous, doesn't matter what society all thinks

01:53:10.060 --> 01:53:13.260
Life is short, you're capable

01:53:18.660 --> 01:53:20.660
Look at your watch now

01:53:21.660 --> 01:53:24.160
You're still a super hot female

01:53:25.160 --> 01:53:27.660
You've got your million dollar contract

01:53:28.660 --> 01:53:31.260
And never waiting for your lunch act

01:53:31.260 --> 01:53:35.440
What'cha waitin', what'cha waitin', what'cha waitin', what'cha waitin', what'cha

01:53:35.440 --> 01:53:37.520
waiting for

01:53:38.460 --> 01:53:41.660
What'cha waitin', what'cha waitin', what'cha waitin', what'cha

01:53:41.660 --> 01:53:44.520
waitin', what'cha waitin' for

01:53:45.200 --> 01:53:48.260
I can't believe it

01:53:50.520 --> 01:53:53.660
Alright, that was a clip of song number one in tonight's Cage Match.

01:53:53.660 --> 01:53:55.960
Gwen Stefani, whatcha waitin' for, last week's winner.

01:53:55.960 --> 01:53:57.860
Song number two in tonight's Cage Match

01:53:57.860 --> 01:54:04.060
comes to us courtesy of Dark Sakura. Dark Sakura, what did you pick out for us tonight?

01:54:04.060 --> 01:54:11.060
I picked a song that was in Amplitude. Okay. I'm pretty sure we haven't done a song before.

01:54:12.140 --> 01:54:17.380
I would remember a band name like Man Child. I forgot the name of it though. That's right,

01:54:17.380 --> 01:54:23.260
it's Man Child and the song is called Nitro Narcosis. Yeah, that was it. For some reason

01:54:23.260 --> 01:54:30.260
I was thinking Narcissus, but I was thinking of that because I was thinking of watching some animes.

01:55:23.260 --> 01:55:25.260
Oh, yeah

01:55:35.260 --> 01:55:37.260
Oh, yeah

01:56:07.260 --> 01:56:32.500
One, two, three.

01:56:32.500 --> 01:56:39.500
Oh yeah!

01:56:39.500 --> 01:56:46.500
Oh yeah!

01:56:46.500 --> 01:56:53.500
Oh yeah!

01:56:53.500 --> 01:57:00.500
Oh yeah!

01:58:30.500 --> 01:58:52.760
Alright though, song number two in tonight's cage match, that was Man Child with Nitro

01:58:52.760 --> 01:58:53.760
Narcosis.

01:58:53.760 --> 01:58:58.880
Let's go around and see what everybody thought of that one, starting off with Jamie.

01:58:58.880 --> 01:59:01.760
I thought that song was pretty cool, it's uh...

01:59:01.760 --> 01:59:04.520
Ashley's fun to listen to when you're driving

01:59:04.520 --> 01:59:08.160
so uh... it gives a uh... nine for uh...

01:59:08.160 --> 01:59:12.320
you know, the speed limit. I was going ninety.

01:59:12.320 --> 01:59:16.320
Alright, let's go over to uh... Arcadian 42 and see what Arcadian thought.

01:59:16.320 --> 01:59:18.640
That sounded pretty cool, from

01:59:18.640 --> 01:59:21.480
Rock of Air, it was a low one from here, but

01:59:21.480 --> 01:59:23.600
yeah, I gave it a nine because it sounded pretty good.

01:59:23.600 --> 01:59:27.080
Alright, a nine from Arcadian. Jonas?

01:59:27.080 --> 01:59:30.680
we'll give it a nine, it sounds pretty good, it's got like a good feel to it

01:59:30.680 --> 01:59:34.360
alright, a nine from explicit as well, and uh, loki

01:59:34.360 --> 01:59:35.120
i liked it

01:59:35.120 --> 01:59:36.840
i think it's a nine

01:59:36.840 --> 01:59:41.280
alright then uh... wow everybody gave it a nine but i'm sorry to break the trend

01:59:41.280 --> 01:59:44.600
but i only thought it was kinda ok, i mean there's just songs in amplitude i like

01:59:44.600 --> 01:59:46.360
better than that one

01:59:46.360 --> 01:59:47.640
i'll give it a five, it's average

01:59:47.640 --> 01:59:49.760
we've already taken some for caged matches

01:59:49.760 --> 01:59:51.540
i know, sorry, i just

01:59:51.540 --> 01:59:53.160
i didn't dig that one as much, sorry

01:59:53.160 --> 01:59:54.060
i gave it a five

01:59:54.060 --> 02:00:00.060
Alright, let's go on to song number three in tonight's cage match. It comes to us from Loki. And Loki, what did you pick tonight?

02:00:00.060 --> 02:00:06.060
Eh, I didn't really have anything, so I just picked a song that I just happened to have lying around.

02:00:06.060 --> 02:00:17.060
Um, this is, uh, another DMshera song, a remix between A and AA. So obviously this would be AAA.

02:00:17.060 --> 02:00:23.060
Okay, here we go. It's, uh, and I love how you just let our listeners know that you're just not even trying anymore.

02:00:23.060 --> 02:00:28.060
Well, I have another song that's decent that I could put in instead, but you already have that song, so...

02:00:28.060 --> 02:00:35.060
Alrighty then, here it is, DJ Amuro, remixed by D.M. Ashura with A-A-A. Enjoy.

02:00:58.060 --> 02:01:03.060
.

02:01:03.060 --> 02:01:08.060
.

02:01:08.060 --> 02:01:13.060
.

02:01:13.060 --> 02:01:18.060
.

02:01:18.060 --> 02:01:23.060

02:03:53.060 --> 02:04:01.700
Alright, that was song number three in tonight's cage match, DJ Amorro remixed by DM Ashrah

02:04:01.700 --> 02:04:02.700
with AAA.

02:04:02.700 --> 02:04:03.700
Jimmy?

02:04:03.700 --> 02:04:08.700
It sounded like A to C. It wasn't bad though at all.

02:04:08.700 --> 02:04:21.700
It's really hard to put my finger on it, because there's just something that, I think it was,

02:04:21.700 --> 02:04:35.700
When you hear that fast drum beat pick up to another part that everybody in God uses, it sort of sounded like there was just recycled tricks in it. But it wasn't bad. So I'd have to give it a seven and a half.

02:04:35.700 --> 02:04:38.700
Alright, seven and a half from Jamie. Arkadian.

02:04:38.700 --> 02:04:42.700
That sounded pretty good. I'd give it like 8.5.

02:04:42.700 --> 02:04:45.700
8.5 from Arkadian. Jonas!

02:04:45.700 --> 02:04:52.700
Well, it sounds pretty good. There are some flaws with it. Like, there's like some recycled samples and sound effects.

02:04:53.700 --> 02:05:00.700
And, well, I don't know. It also sounds like some of the elements used in previous DMS shows work as well.

02:05:01.700 --> 02:05:08.700
I respect DMS shows work a lot because you send so much for remixing good remixes.

02:05:09.700 --> 02:05:12.700
As opposed to Paranoia of Cowgirl Survivor Max?

02:05:12.700 --> 02:05:20.700
For that 1, 2, 3, 4, Max is kind of crap, but we heard somebody play it at the station.

02:05:20.700 --> 02:05:28.700
And I have to say, it's not a Max remix, but I love a God.

02:05:28.700 --> 02:05:32.700
But yeah, I might actually do a tin foil for this, so I'll just give it an 8.

02:05:32.700 --> 02:05:34.700
Alright, an 8 from Jonas.

02:05:34.700 --> 02:05:36.700
Loki I

02:05:36.700 --> 02:05:44.300
Would pretend to be excited, but I'm not so I don't care whatever it gets it gets a triple-a because yeah

02:05:44.820 --> 02:05:46.820
Whatever. I don't care tonight

02:05:47.540 --> 02:05:52.000
I'm sure that made a lot of fanboys and girls very moist in their nether regions

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:56.380
But I don't know it it just didn't do it for me. It didn't have the same charm of the original

02:05:56.380 --> 02:05:57.740
I mean it was cool. It wasn't bad

02:05:57.740 --> 02:05:58.540
Don't get me wrong

02:05:58.540 --> 02:06:03.780
So I was gonna give it a six but Jonas brought up a very good point and the fact that it's not a max 300

02:06:03.780 --> 02:06:07.740
And for that I give it a bonus point so I give it a seven overall all right

02:06:07.920 --> 02:06:13.340
But you know what it doesn't matter what we think it matters what you think so you guys can vote in our chat room here

02:06:13.340 --> 02:06:18.260
Are the three songs one more time that you can vote for tonight in tonight's cage match Gwen Stefani what you waiting for?

02:06:18.260 --> 02:06:42.000
And song number two tonight, Manchild with Nitro Narcosis.

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:47.040
In song number three tonight, DJ Amuro, remixed by D.M. Asherah with Triple A.

02:06:47.040 --> 02:07:06.840
Alright guys, place vote now. Send a private message to Sky in the chatroom with your votes.

02:07:06.840 --> 02:07:11.720
And your votes will be counted up and we will reveal the winner shortly, as soon as we get

02:07:11.720 --> 02:07:18.160
the votes. All right, in the meantime, let's go over to Loki because I want to ask Loki

02:07:18.160 --> 02:07:22.360
what's going on in the Simphile world right now. Speaking since we just had a D.M. Ashora

02:07:22.360 --> 02:07:30.200
song, it's somewhat appropriate. Not a whole lot. There is a test version of StepMania's

02:07:30.200 --> 02:07:35.000
Urbanized theme which is a little bit different than most of the other themes out there. It's

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:39.960
kind of a neat look to it. There's dancing characters for you. Oh, the dancing characters

02:07:39.960 --> 02:07:48.560
there are. There is a skin edit of Emi and Hallus Emi that is sort of gothic looking.

02:07:48.560 --> 02:07:55.400
It looks pretty nice. And then of course the fun one, there is Master Chief from Halo.

02:07:55.400 --> 02:08:00.720
You get to dance around as Master Chief from Halo. And that is the funniest thing you can

02:08:00.720 --> 02:08:06.800
watch on StatMania. Other than that, really not much else going on other than you probably

02:08:06.800 --> 02:08:23.800
Did they ever fix the Mr. Spanky dancing character? I think I remember that there were, like, issues with it or something.

02:08:23.800 --> 02:08:29.800
Yeah, I fixed. So, it was just a, I don't know, a bad file or something.

02:08:30.800 --> 02:08:34.800
But it works now, since Mr. Spanky can dance around like crazy.

02:08:37.800 --> 02:08:45.800
Yeah, have there been any new skins for Stepmanially recently? I noticed you still hoard that Technofield one, but has there been anything new?

02:08:45.800 --> 02:08:47.800
Techno-fiend, whatever.

02:09:15.800 --> 02:09:20.480
Also, I forgot to mention, of course, you know, Festival, the new steps are being coded

02:09:20.480 --> 02:09:28.360
for that, and also for the new songs in UltraMix 2, and for the Dancing Sage Fusion stuff should

02:09:28.360 --> 02:09:35.720
be coming out eventually. It's a little easier to do it from Xbox, because they can actually

02:09:35.720 --> 02:09:42.720
rip the steps and code them directly, so it makes it a little easier. So look for those

02:09:42.720 --> 02:09:49.720
the hit probably DDRUK at some point relatively soon. Other than that, really not too much

02:09:49.720 --> 02:09:55.220
else. Just, I mean, if you want to go find some good skins for Step Maniac, go to DDRManiacs,

02:09:55.220 --> 02:09:59.660
go to their Step Mania forum. There's a whole section for themes, and there's a ton they're

02:09:59.660 --> 02:10:03.720
being worked on right now, and they even have a whole thread of ones that are finished,

02:10:03.720 --> 02:10:08.720
and there's plenty for you to choose from. So just go look over there, and you'll find

02:10:08.720 --> 02:10:13.720
All right, sounds good. Do you guys want to know who won tonight's cage match?

02:10:13.720 --> 02:10:14.720
Yeah!

02:10:14.720 --> 02:10:21.920
All right, it was very close. It was won by one vote, and then the other song, it beat

02:10:21.920 --> 02:10:26.480
it by two votes. It was all very, very neck and neck tonight. Tonight's winner, I think

02:10:26.480 --> 02:10:32.720
this is actually a bit of a surprise to me, tonight's winner is Gwen Stefani!

02:10:32.720 --> 02:10:33.720
Geez!

02:10:33.720 --> 02:10:37.720
For the second week in a row, if you can imagine that.

02:10:37.720 --> 02:10:40.720
Oh, Loki says it's on.

02:10:40.720 --> 02:10:42.720
It's gone next week, trust me.

02:10:42.720 --> 02:10:44.720
I want four weeks in a row, man.

02:10:44.720 --> 02:10:46.720
I want Gwen Stefani to get retired, man.

02:10:46.720 --> 02:10:48.720
She's awesome.

02:10:48.720 --> 02:10:49.720
All right.

02:10:49.720 --> 02:10:51.720
By one vote.

02:10:51.720 --> 02:10:52.720
So close.

02:10:52.720 --> 02:10:53.720
Every vote counts.

02:10:53.720 --> 02:10:54.720
What can I say?

02:10:54.720 --> 02:10:57.720
We could have had a tie and somebody could have broken the tie, but no.

02:10:57.720 --> 02:10:59.720
One vote decided it all.

02:10:59.720 --> 02:11:03.920
of course everybody in chat rooms bitching about it oh hell no

02:11:03.920 --> 02:11:08.440
don't tell me that song won hey you guys you guys voted for it I'm counting the

02:11:08.440 --> 02:11:11.960
votes right here I think but I think the people that voted for it are kind of

02:11:11.960 --> 02:11:15.280
hiding now because they see that the wrath is coming to get them all right

02:11:15.280 --> 02:11:20.280
they want to know what came in second it was song number triple-a by one vote and

02:11:20.280 --> 02:11:24.080
then the other song was down by two votes but all pretty much across the

02:11:24.080 --> 02:11:30.280
board all pretty much across the board all right so we will see what happens

02:11:30.280 --> 02:11:34.040
next week in the orange lounge cage match but for now let's get back to ultra

02:11:34.040 --> 02:11:37.080
mix two songs shall we I think we can all agree the ultra mix two songs are

02:11:37.080 --> 02:11:39.960
pretty good and in this break we're gonna hear oh my favorite ones in this

02:11:39.960 --> 02:11:44.480
break one of my favorites toe jam is in this break this song is great it's like

02:11:44.480 --> 02:11:48.280
a country song and then tough enough by vanilla ninja will hear in this break

02:11:48.280 --> 02:11:51.920
too as well as wherever you are by lava for those of you that play doubles I

02:11:51.920 --> 02:11:55.600
I hear the doubles light steps have a certain way you're supposed to play them.

02:11:55.600 --> 02:11:58.640
I don't know what that means, but that's what I've been told, so.

02:11:58.640 --> 02:11:59.640
Means hoedown!

02:11:59.640 --> 02:12:00.640
Square dance!

02:12:00.640 --> 02:12:01.640
All right.

02:12:01.640 --> 02:12:02.640
Here we go.

02:12:02.640 --> 02:12:04.640
We will be right back after this.

02:14:04.640 --> 02:14:18.640
Baby, don't be the strong that survive All the mysteries of life

02:14:18.640 --> 02:14:32.640
Oh, we fight just to keep you away And don't let go of the broken shield

02:14:32.640 --> 02:14:39.640
So keep on living, don't stop believing The devil's a queen

02:14:39.640 --> 02:14:50.640
Could you get your wings and see where the fire breaks?

02:14:50.640 --> 02:14:55.640
Baby, that's up to none

02:14:55.640 --> 02:15:01.640
I need you there, cause I need you there

02:15:01.640 --> 02:15:06.640
Oh, tonight

02:15:06.640 --> 02:15:08.640
So keep on looking upon me

02:15:08.640 --> 02:15:10.640
If you don't come, don't be a runaway

02:15:10.640 --> 02:15:12.640
Go for the fire

02:15:12.640 --> 02:15:14.640
Baby, that's enough

02:15:16.640 --> 02:15:17.640
So keep on living the song

02:15:17.640 --> 02:15:19.640
Stop giving the devil the green

02:15:19.640 --> 02:15:22.640
Get you in the middle of high praise

02:15:22.640 --> 02:15:24.640
Baby, that's enough

02:15:28.640 --> 02:15:29.640
So keep on living the song

02:15:29.640 --> 02:15:32.140
C'mon now, don't be stuck in the depths

02:15:32.140 --> 02:15:35.140
Get your hands in the heartbreak

02:15:35.140 --> 02:15:37.140
Baby, that's enough

02:15:37.140 --> 02:15:39.140
Baby, that's enough

02:16:07.140 --> 02:16:36.420
When I feel blue, I think of you, cause you're true, wherever you are, near or far, you still are my shining star, sometimes it's bad, things get bad, and I'm sad, wherever you are, there is light,

02:16:36.420 --> 02:16:40.420
By my side, I feel all right

02:17:06.420 --> 02:17:26.660
La la la la la la la La la la la la la la

02:17:26.660 --> 02:17:50.740
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, hope you're enjoying the Ultramix 2 songs we've

02:17:50.740 --> 02:17:51.740
been playing so far.

02:17:51.740 --> 02:17:54.180
What did you guys think of Toe Jam?

02:17:54.180 --> 02:17:55.900
Yee-ho Ninja Cowboy.

02:17:55.900 --> 02:17:59.900
Which is funny, because it was followed up by Vanilla Ninja.

02:17:59.900 --> 02:18:03.900
What did you think of ToeJam? You guys explicit?

02:18:03.900 --> 02:18:07.900
It's amazing.

02:18:07.900 --> 02:18:11.900
It's country gone techno.

02:18:11.900 --> 02:18:15.900
What did you say, Loki?

02:18:15.900 --> 02:18:19.900
Where's Earl?

02:18:19.900 --> 02:18:23.900
I had a ToeJam & Earl song in the pre-show.

02:18:23.900 --> 02:18:28.140
funny realization in our chat room before the show, during the pre-show. He was talking

02:18:28.140 --> 02:18:32.620
about the song Toe Jam and he said, it's funny because there's a pun in there because you

02:18:32.620 --> 02:18:41.380
know you're jamming on your toes to the steps. Get it? Huh? Funny. Funny stuff. Everybody's

02:18:41.380 --> 02:18:46.620
a comedian these days. Alright, I think it's time boys and girls to get into a segment

02:18:46.620 --> 02:18:52.240
that I know a lot of you guys just love and adore and that is the FUs of the week. And

02:18:52.240 --> 02:18:56.040
Yes, week in and week out we have to do these all the time.

02:18:56.040 --> 02:19:00.280
Jamie, why do we have to do these FUs every single week?

02:19:00.280 --> 02:19:07.280
Cause we're sick and not gonna take it.

02:19:07.280 --> 02:19:26.480
I would like to offer a big F.U. to the Lexus van freshly purchased that was driving in

02:19:26.480 --> 02:19:33.400
front of me, doing not the normal 1-2 car space that you're supposed to have, but doing

02:19:33.400 --> 02:19:42.280
like five car leaks and going so slow that person takes me off um also I just

02:19:42.280 --> 02:19:51.040
want to give the big F you to PMS because it sucks um really my angst

02:19:51.040 --> 02:19:58.320
knows no bounds and I don't have words to properly express it so oh yeah F you

02:19:58.320 --> 02:20:06.120
this fucking paper I hate you focus on ethics what are those but that's really

02:20:06.120 --> 02:20:11.040
about it I'm just sort of angst it out so I'm gonna pass on the mic and release

02:20:11.040 --> 02:20:15.800
my anger in a more physical method by beating up you know an inanimate object

02:20:15.800 --> 02:20:20.440
probably a fax machine office face child awesome I just need the gangster rap we

02:20:20.440 --> 02:20:24.280
play in the background you know remember if you guys want to send in an F you

02:20:24.280 --> 02:20:27.600
send a private message to sky in our chat room right now while we move on to

02:20:27.600 --> 02:20:31.600
Fuck you, Loki.

02:20:31.600 --> 02:20:35.600
Fuck you to trees and the leaves that they drop.

02:20:35.600 --> 02:20:39.600
My god, there is literally like a couple feet of leaves

02:20:39.600 --> 02:20:43.600
outside. We walk out there to my car and there's literally a pile of

02:20:43.600 --> 02:20:47.600
leaves next to my car. I swear if I leave my car there for a few more days

02:20:47.600 --> 02:20:51.600
they're just going to be covered in leaves.

02:20:51.600 --> 02:20:55.600
It's fun to kick them and make lots of noise late at night.

02:20:55.600 --> 02:20:59.200
There wasn't any leaves on the ground, really, and then came in and they were just like all over the place.

02:20:59.200 --> 02:21:00.400
Yeah, they all fell at once.

02:21:02.400 --> 02:21:04.300
So that fucking sucks.

02:21:04.300 --> 02:21:12.000
Also, fuck you, G4TV, because you suck, and your stupid attempt at doing something clever...

02:21:13.400 --> 02:21:17.300
The Nintendo DS day was fucking lame.

02:21:17.300 --> 02:21:22.200
Okay, I don't like watching TV in a small little screen on my TV,

02:21:22.200 --> 02:21:27.400
Showing the show and what looks like a DS around the show and some stupid chatting going

02:21:27.400 --> 02:21:30.500
on the little bottom screen that's supposed to be on there.

02:21:30.500 --> 02:21:31.920
That's a really dumb idea.

02:21:31.920 --> 02:21:37.720
Stupid, gimmicky, something that would be coming from G4TV.

02:21:37.720 --> 02:21:42.200
And I'm sure all those people fired from, you know, Unscrewed and the Screensavers are

02:21:42.200 --> 02:21:44.360
thanking you.

02:21:44.360 --> 02:21:46.360
You're so clever.

02:21:46.360 --> 02:22:08.360
Um, and finally, um, fuck you that my money isn't on my card yet, that pisses me off because I want to go spending, spending, spending, spending, and uh, fuck you using my GameShark for breaking, especially after I spent like an hour putting all the codes in, and playing with it a few days, and then all of a sudden it just stopped working.

02:22:08.360 --> 02:22:19.360
Thank you, Interact, for selling that, you know, product to someone else, and then, uh, I don't know. Just dropping it all together. They suck.

02:22:19.360 --> 02:22:23.360
Matter of fact, they make you buy multiple versions of the cards.

02:22:23.360 --> 02:22:33.360
I guess cheaters never prosper. Except for me, because I bought a new one. I bought a new one. So there. Um, and that's all.

02:22:33.360 --> 02:22:43.680
Oh, things just keep getting better No, they get worse

02:22:43.680 --> 02:22:46.560
F you to getting stood up That is awful

02:22:46.560 --> 02:22:49.640
Why do you do that to people? That is rude!

02:22:49.640 --> 02:22:52.760
It's so rude God damn you

02:22:52.760 --> 02:22:56.060
Oh, that's alright I forgive though

02:22:56.060 --> 02:22:58.240
I forgave I'm such a sucker

02:22:58.240 --> 02:23:01.480
No, that's alright I try to understand

02:23:01.480 --> 02:23:25.200
I

02:23:25.200 --> 02:23:28.900
FU to the fact that I have to wake up at four in the morning to catch a flight to LA so

02:23:28.900 --> 02:23:34.240
I can do one day's worth of work in LA. I'm training a whopping four people tomorrow and

02:23:34.240 --> 02:23:38.160
they're sending me all the way down there costing them I don't know how much money and

02:23:38.160 --> 02:23:42.880
the fact is I will be working from about six o'clock in the morning till seven or eight

02:23:42.880 --> 02:23:47.720
at night. That's because corporations are retarded. But they give me lots of money so

02:23:47.720 --> 02:23:50.880
it's okay

02:23:50.880 --> 02:23:53.320
and uh... that you to mail p m s

02:23:53.320 --> 02:23:54.680

02:23:54.680 --> 02:23:57.520
and that

02:23:57.520 --> 02:24:00.240
all right let's move on and see what some of our other folks in the room have

02:24:00.240 --> 02:24:05.040
to say starting with are katie and forty-two

02:24:05.040 --> 02:24:08.080
uh... bucky the

02:24:08.080 --> 02:24:10.320
parking ticket machine in the courthouse

02:24:10.320 --> 02:24:12.920
eating right dollar and i think

02:24:12.920 --> 02:24:16.720
parking tickets, so I had to go and park and go get the walk up thing

02:24:16.720 --> 02:24:18.680
I lost a dollar to that damn piece of shit

02:24:18.680 --> 02:24:23.800
uh... fuck you to uh... my foot for hurting

02:24:23.800 --> 02:24:25.120
it's hurting for a little while

02:24:25.120 --> 02:24:27.480
uh... fuck you to my

02:24:27.480 --> 02:24:30.800
parts of it are like oily and greasy and yucky

02:24:30.800 --> 02:24:33.000
and I wash it off all the time

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:35.160
and then it's fucking dry

02:24:35.160 --> 02:24:38.160
damn winter does weird things to me

02:24:38.160 --> 02:24:45.160
uh...

02:24:50.800 --> 02:24:54.120
alright explicit

02:24:54.120 --> 02:24:58.360
after having too many tests for one whole week

02:24:58.360 --> 02:25:00.560
even though I passed it all, it took me like

02:25:00.560 --> 02:25:03.400
only getting three hours of sleep

02:25:03.400 --> 02:25:06.240
after working a twelve hour shift

02:25:06.240 --> 02:25:22.240
Sorry for having a 12 hour shift on a Friday, working at 7pm to 7 in the morning, and then later on going to the Bay Area right after. You're only giving me like 30 minutes of sleep. Oh wow.

02:25:22.240 --> 02:25:26.240
Yeah, but then later on I have to sleep in the party.

02:25:26.240 --> 02:25:31.840
for not getting WWE Stacey Q was autographed on Saturday. A friend of mine was supposed

02:25:31.840 --> 02:25:35.400
to go but he couldn't go because his license got stolen. Is Stacey Q the one that sang

02:25:35.400 --> 02:25:46.960
Two of Hearts? Rad! Yeah, she's the one with the good ass. And here's the end of one big

02:25:46.960 --> 02:25:54.060
F you to the NBA on Friday. Like god, Pacers and the Pistons. Why the hell are you going

02:25:54.060 --> 02:25:58.340
to go fight over something or just over a game just because someone's dunked

02:25:58.340 --> 02:26:05.460
over your ass and what is asked for our tests why the fuck did you punch the

02:26:05.460 --> 02:26:12.220
wrong pad who who you thought through the a bunch of cup of ice on you that

02:26:12.220 --> 02:26:16.380
was a wrong person you suck a white man

02:26:16.380 --> 02:26:21.380
instead of some lady who was behind you do actually do it against you

02:26:21.380 --> 02:26:27.380
Yeah, but gosh, the NBA, oh yeah, that also resolves.

02:26:27.380 --> 02:26:34.380
Eff you to the fans at the NBA, at that Detroit game, who are also calling to find the first place.

02:26:34.380 --> 02:26:40.380
Man, why can't we all get along? Seriously.

02:26:40.380 --> 02:26:42.380
Preach on.

02:26:42.380 --> 02:26:50.380
Yeah, when people fighting over things, I think a few people got hospitalized over the fights, and people need to spend it indefinitely.

02:26:50.380 --> 02:26:58.780
Don't come around bling on ooh, ooh, it's the NBA's fault or ooh, it's the Detroit Pistons fault. It's everybody's fault in the first place

02:27:01.240 --> 02:27:02.660
Seriously

02:27:02.660 --> 02:27:08.080
People need to grow up use good use their own common sense not to do some shit like that ever again

02:27:09.820 --> 02:27:16.500
Well, I think yeah, I think well so far that they're suspended it's definitely but most likely gonna be suspended for the whole season

02:27:16.500 --> 02:27:26.480
but who knows I don't give a shit and FUT trees for for putting a goddamn tree

02:27:26.480 --> 02:27:36.820

02:29:02.780 --> 02:29:06.780
Well, oh well. Maybe next week.

02:29:06.780 --> 02:29:10.780
Alright, can I get to the chatroom now? To be continued. Alright, as always. Alright,

02:29:10.780 --> 02:29:15.780
here we go. Moving on to the chatroom FUs. Ooh, didn't we just hear this? I think it

02:29:15.780 --> 02:29:22.780
would be a good FU music, though. MPQ says, a big FU to Washington State for not having

02:29:22.780 --> 02:29:31.340
2DX machines. Poto says, F you to greedy repo men who steal your Xbox. No Halo 2 or Ultra

02:29:31.340 --> 02:29:40.340
Mix 2 for me. DJ Ronma SDS says, F you to the dumb customers at Best Buy. I know how

02:29:40.340 --> 02:29:44.580

02:29:44.580 --> 02:29:50.880
Pentium 4 chip with a potato. Oh yeah, F you to cock-teasing girls. You fucking suck. Expect

02:29:50.880 --> 02:29:54.360
flaming bag of shit on your front door hey that's one way to win the chicks

02:29:54.360 --> 02:30:02.960
over Jamie Jamie chicks dig flaming bags of shit right I love it when you're not

02:30:02.960 --> 02:30:12.480
paying attention to the show like a yeast infection

02:30:12.480 --> 02:30:16.480
Yeast is good. Yeast is in bread. I like bread. What's wrong there?

02:30:16.480 --> 02:30:19.480
Not Candida yeast.

02:30:19.480 --> 02:30:25.480
Yeast in bread is different than yeast in your vagina, okay?

02:30:25.480 --> 02:30:32.480
Do you know what happens when you get a Candida yeast buildup in your organs, like your stomach and your intestines?

02:30:32.480 --> 02:30:37.480
It makes you die.

02:30:37.480 --> 02:30:44.480
Yeah, it turns your stomach and your intestines into bread, and then you die, because they can't digest. There you go.

02:30:44.480 --> 02:30:46.480
Ferment them.

02:30:46.480 --> 02:30:48.480
Oh my lord.

02:30:48.480 --> 02:30:50.480
We hit a whole new low tonight, ladies and gentlemen.

02:30:50.480 --> 02:30:57.480
Misty says, F me for falling asleep and missing part of the UltraMix 2 show. Aw, it's okay.

02:30:57.480 --> 02:31:03.560
Legend of Zaku says, F you to the fact that DDR Ultra Mix 2 got the better songs and DDR

02:31:03.560 --> 02:31:08.080
Extreme USA owners getting the shaft by Konami for favoring Microsoft with a dollar sign

02:31:08.080 --> 02:31:09.080
over Sony.

02:31:09.080 --> 02:31:13.140
F you to my braces for being retightened, thus making my teeth hurt.

02:31:13.140 --> 02:31:16.000
And F you to the fact that I have two hard to sell exams tomorrow, both of which I'm

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:18.120
not truly prepared for.

02:31:18.120 --> 02:31:22.580
F you to the Pacers, Ron Artest for punching the wrong fan, and F you to the Pistons, Ben

02:31:22.580 --> 02:31:25.120
Wallace for pushing Artest in the first place.

02:31:25.120 --> 02:31:29.040
Our test got what he deserves and enjoy promoting that rap album now that you can't play this

02:31:29.040 --> 02:31:33.640
season.

02:31:33.640 --> 02:31:40.480
Dark Knight says, my FUs to going work especially on Friday the 25th aka Black Friday because

02:31:40.480 --> 02:31:43.600
I know that I'm going to be getting these a-hole customers that always seem to give

02:31:43.600 --> 02:31:49.000
me a total hard time, nothing more.

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:54.360
Seagurd says, FU to the lackluster DS launch, hey but you had G4, just kidding.

02:31:54.360 --> 02:31:58.760
the hell is my worry aware that isn't that isn't feel the magic f you to

02:31:58.760 --> 02:32:01.680
homeless people because they were chasing me in my dream before turning

02:32:01.680 --> 02:32:11.840

02:32:11.840 --> 02:32:16.080
week for only feeling being mildly funny I agree it was only mildly funny more

02:32:16.080 --> 02:32:20.160
Alexander and Foxy and Ling Ling and less everyone else.

02:32:20.160 --> 02:32:28.000
Final F.U. to people complaining about it taking too long to get G2 unlocked.

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:33.220
I unlocked it in under a minute, so what's the problem?

02:32:33.220 --> 02:32:35.760
You know something they don't, you little jerk.

02:32:35.760 --> 02:32:37.560
You know it damn well.

02:32:37.560 --> 02:32:38.560
Alright.

02:32:38.560 --> 02:32:39.560
Dark Tetsuya.

02:32:39.560 --> 02:32:44.480
DarkPetsuya, I'm going to have to agree with Loki. F you to G4 and the stupidest publicity

02:32:44.480 --> 02:32:54.360
stunt ever. DarkLionXVI says, only one F you tonight. F you to my router for suddenly disconnecting

02:32:54.360 --> 02:33:04.160
me. That's it. Thank you very much for playing everybody in our chat room. Alright, let's

02:33:04.160 --> 02:33:07.160
do some more Ultramix. We're starting to run out of showtime, so I definitely want to get

02:33:07.160 --> 02:33:11.440
some more Ultramix 2 songs in before the show is over. And maybe we'll do some Ask Orange

02:33:11.440 --> 02:33:14.320
Lounge when we come back. Ooh, doesn't that sound like fun? I know you kids love that

02:33:14.320 --> 02:33:19.480
segment. So in this break, Rubberneckin', the Elvis song. We're going to hear that along

02:33:19.480 --> 02:33:25.600
with a rock song called Sleepwalker and Tittle Tattle. We'll be back after this. And remember,

02:33:25.600 --> 02:33:32.600
Ask Orange Lounge is coming up, so send us some questions in our chat room right now.

02:33:55.600 --> 02:34:02.600
Some people say I'm wasted time, they don't really know

02:34:02.600 --> 02:34:09.600
What would I see, to see what I've got, it gives me such a long hand

02:34:09.600 --> 02:34:15.600
Sitting alone in my porch, all by myself

02:34:15.600 --> 02:34:21.600
Blue king, Mary Jane, I'm with somebody else

02:34:21.600 --> 02:34:26.600
Hey, hey, hey, stop lookin' less of me

02:34:26.600 --> 02:34:29.600
That's my philosophy

02:34:29.600 --> 02:34:33.600
It's called repenekton baby

02:34:33.600 --> 02:34:37.600
That's alright with me

02:34:37.600 --> 02:34:40.600
Hey, hey, hey, hey, baby

02:34:40.600 --> 02:34:44.600
That's alright with me

02:34:44.600 --> 02:34:47.600
Repenekton baby

02:34:47.600 --> 02:34:50.600
That's alright with me

02:35:20.600 --> 02:35:42.600
Today is like the other day, I feel I'm lost like it's yet to day

02:35:42.600 --> 02:35:47.600
Nothing stands inside of me

02:35:47.600 --> 02:35:53.600
I can't seem to turn around, turn around to you again

02:35:53.600 --> 02:35:58.600
Nothing stands inside of me

02:35:58.600 --> 02:36:07.600
By the way, by the way, I'm not okay

02:36:07.600 --> 02:36:12.600
To be awake is the only thing I want

02:36:12.600 --> 02:36:17.600
With you, I'm just walking in my sleep

02:36:17.600 --> 02:36:22.600
To be awake is the only thing I want

02:36:22.600 --> 02:36:28.600
With you, I'm just walking in my sleep

02:36:28.600 --> 02:36:38.600
I could forget again if I said, if I said

02:36:38.600 --> 02:36:43.600
With you, with you

02:36:43.600 --> 02:36:48.600
I have to forget again my name, my name

02:37:18.600 --> 02:37:23.100
All for perfection, so very hard to reach

02:37:23.100 --> 02:37:28.600
Harmony machine, tormenting the sensory

02:37:28.600 --> 02:37:33.600
Deliciously evolved, and yet nobody knows

02:37:33.600 --> 02:37:38.600
Diddle daddle, chit chat, shoot in the breeze

02:37:38.600 --> 02:37:41.600
Put a clack, need a splatter

02:37:41.600 --> 02:37:44.600
The truth is a sacred symphony

02:37:49.600 --> 02:37:51.600
Tied from the familiar

02:37:52.600 --> 02:37:54.600
Conjure a search of jives

02:37:55.600 --> 02:37:56.600
Fidget in the mind

02:37:57.600 --> 02:37:59.600
Enjoy chats with no regrets

02:38:00.600 --> 02:38:02.600
Channelizing hallucinations

02:38:03.600 --> 02:38:04.600
Windu licking the imagination

02:38:05.600 --> 02:38:07.600
Fingers digging shadows dancing

02:38:07.600 --> 02:38:10.600
Here's a synchronous symphony

02:38:15.600 --> 02:38:19.600
Diddle-daddle, chin-chat, shootin' the breeze

02:38:20.600 --> 02:38:22.600
Pat-a-clack, skatin' splatters

02:38:22.600 --> 02:38:26.600
Lattice is a synchronous symphony

02:38:52.600 --> 02:39:02.520
radio. We are back here on Orange Launch Radio having a little too much fun with

02:39:02.520 --> 02:39:08.920
PictoChat actually. I found the way that you could pull down the last image

02:39:08.920 --> 02:39:12.760
that was drawn or scroll up and so you can like erase things and change things

02:39:12.760 --> 02:39:19.080
in the image. It makes a fun game. The DS never knew that they had in there.

02:39:19.080 --> 02:39:21.080
And you know what else?

02:39:21.360 --> 02:39:25.660
This is why the end gauge never worked because it didn't have picto chat honestly

02:39:26.120 --> 02:39:32.080
Imagine if you could have picto chat and send those little pictograms anywhere in the USA even to random phone numbers

02:39:33.400 --> 02:39:35.400
I'll be the best

02:39:36.200 --> 02:39:38.200
What is this cock

02:39:38.980 --> 02:39:41.100
What does this cock on the cell phone?

02:39:42.360 --> 02:39:45.200
Why you call me a cock? I am no rooster

02:39:45.200 --> 02:39:55.080
Let's get to some Ask Orange Lounge, remember if you guys have a question, send it in over

02:39:55.080 --> 02:39:58.480
private message right now, also we'll open up the Skype line in a little bit if you guys

02:39:58.480 --> 02:40:08.360
want to call in and have a comment or something, I don't know, but here we go.

02:40:08.360 --> 02:40:13.640
Let's Ask Orange Lounge, some stupid question, what will we find out this week on Orange

02:40:13.640 --> 02:40:19.800
lounge radio all I really know is that it's a really good thing that you guys

02:40:19.800 --> 02:40:26.960
can't see our picto chats because then you'd think we're perverts as if you

02:40:26.960 --> 02:40:34.660
didn't already know that extra verse tonight all right uh Flair O'Day says

02:40:34.660 --> 02:40:39.880
this hey isn't it a bit strange that they put a good chunk of the unlocks for

02:40:39.880 --> 02:40:43.520
ultra mix 2 on the v-ware and you know what come to think of it a good half of

02:40:43.520 --> 02:40:47.520
The Extreme V-Rare songs are unlocks too! What's up with that?

02:40:47.520 --> 02:40:52.520
I kind of agree. It kind of took a little bit of the thrill out of the unlocks, the fact that they were all already on the V-Rare.

02:40:52.520 --> 02:40:56.520
But at the same time, it was some of the best stuff on the mix, so I don't know.

02:40:56.520 --> 02:41:03.520
I would have liked to have seen more of the different drum songs, but I just thought the V-Rare was great because it had Skulk and Superstar. I thought that was neat.

02:41:03.520 --> 02:41:07.520
Any other comments? Thoughts on the Ultramix 2 V-Rare?

02:41:07.520 --> 02:41:10.520
It was pretty good. I liked it.

02:41:10.520 --> 02:41:13.320
What is this weird that they put so many unlocks on it?

02:41:13.320 --> 02:41:16.420
You pretty much knew 9 of the un- or was it 9 or 10? I don't know.

02:41:16.420 --> 02:41:19.020
A lot. A whole lot of the unlocks just by, um,

02:41:19.820 --> 02:41:22.320
picking yourself up a copy of the viewer, which, by the way,

02:41:22.320 --> 02:41:26.320
I'm trying to snag us some extra copies so that we can give them away on the show.

02:41:26.820 --> 02:41:30.320
So, even after the Kiriyamaoka giveaway is done, um, we'll do, uh,

02:41:30.320 --> 02:41:32.720
hopefully another giveaway, some Ultramix 2 v-rares,

02:41:32.720 --> 02:41:36.020
uh, maybe for much easier things, just like calling in at a certain time or something.

02:41:36.020 --> 02:41:37.520
We'll see. We'll see. I don't know.

02:41:37.520 --> 02:41:44.200
Alright, moving in and on. Let's see what Dark Knight has to say. Okay. If a tree falls

02:41:44.200 --> 02:41:48.680
in the woods, does it make a sound? No, just kidding. The real question is, how much of

02:41:48.680 --> 02:41:54.800
a lifespan will the DS have before Nintendo decides to make a new handheld? Any thoughts

02:41:54.800 --> 02:42:03.080
on this? Loki. By new handheld, do you mean another color? Seriously, I give it, uh, February

02:42:03.080 --> 02:42:07.440
will have new DS colors honestly and then then there will be some kind of

02:42:07.440 --> 02:42:09.560
super DS or like DS

02:42:09.560 --> 02:42:11.560
extreme or some something

02:42:11.560 --> 02:42:15.100
where you're gonna have to re-buy the DS because they did the same damn thing with the

02:42:15.100 --> 02:42:18.000
Game Boy when they did the little...

02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:22.120
They're gonna do DS mess colors and DS Famicom colors and...

02:42:22.120 --> 02:42:23.280
I mean look

02:42:23.280 --> 02:42:26.040
they had Game Boy and then they had Game Boy Pocket

02:42:26.040 --> 02:42:28.920
then they had Game Boy Color then they had all the fucking

02:42:28.920 --> 02:42:30.940
colored Game Boy colors

02:42:30.940 --> 02:42:34.140
and then they're not going to be as much crap as the PSP will be and then they

02:42:34.140 --> 02:42:38.480
had Game Boy Advance and they had the SP so it is only likely the DS will have

02:42:38.480 --> 02:42:39.420
some kind of

02:42:39.420 --> 02:42:43.720
and then you have the Virtual Boy and the

02:42:43.720 --> 02:42:44.920
oh yeah

02:42:44.920 --> 02:42:46.320
alright we got the DS

02:42:46.320 --> 02:42:49.800
and if it does well I anticipate you're going to see some newer model come out

02:42:49.800 --> 02:42:50.260
that

02:42:50.260 --> 02:42:54.040
everybody's going to want to have to have

02:42:54.040 --> 02:42:56.600
a secret in our chat room says people

02:42:56.600 --> 02:43:02.600
There are no color combinations that will work besides the silver and black. I have thought about this for hours.

02:43:05.600 --> 02:43:06.600
Get a life.

02:43:08.600 --> 02:43:11.600
Yeah, the QS. Quad screen.

02:43:12.600 --> 02:43:17.600
Let's see how many screens we can cram into this thing. I don't know.

02:43:17.600 --> 02:43:26.600
So, to be honest, I think the next thing you're going to hear about DS is going to be a Bluetooth network where you can actually play online internet games.

02:43:26.600 --> 02:43:28.600
And it'll be a peripheral, though.

02:43:28.600 --> 02:43:35.600
It's coming out. Warppipe is working on it. They're not saying that's what they're working on, but that's what they're working on.

02:43:35.600 --> 02:43:43.600
So, you'll see that at E3 this year, though, because they're going to be at E3 this year. But, not until then.

02:43:43.600 --> 02:43:46.600
Alright, let's go on to the next question.

02:43:46.600 --> 02:43:51.400
DJ Doe, how did you get the music from Ultramix on the Orange Lawns radio?

02:43:51.400 --> 02:43:56.240
The reason I'm asking is because I like to make a music CD out of the songs from Ultramix.

02:43:56.240 --> 02:43:57.240
Very carefully.

02:43:57.240 --> 02:43:58.920
No, we rip them ourselves actually.

02:43:58.920 --> 02:44:02.720
We have the soundboard hooked up through the Xbox, that's how we got tonight's songs.

02:44:02.720 --> 02:44:06.760
And I know they're not like 100% perfect quality, so honestly you may not want to burn them

02:44:06.760 --> 02:44:08.400
to CD.

02:44:08.400 --> 02:44:12.080
But honestly, just keep looking around there on some of the different forums out there

02:44:12.080 --> 02:44:13.080
on the net.

02:44:13.080 --> 02:44:14.500
Something will turn up soon enough.

02:44:14.500 --> 02:44:15.500
Always does.

02:44:15.500 --> 02:44:16.500
Any advice, Loki?

02:44:16.500 --> 02:44:18.500
DDRUK once the Symphiles are out.

02:44:18.500 --> 02:44:22.500
Yeah, honestly, most of your Symphiles sites will have them pretty soon, so.

02:44:22.500 --> 02:44:26.500
But you should continue to listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because we play them first.

02:44:26.500 --> 02:44:29.500
At least, usually. Not always, but sometimes.

02:44:29.500 --> 02:44:31.500
Alright, Legend of Zaku says,

02:44:31.500 --> 02:44:37.500
Why are DDR Extreme USA owners getting the shaft now that UltraMix 2 came out and got the better of the songs?

02:44:39.500 --> 02:44:44.500
I think they just tried to do something different with Extreme, with the whole iToy thing.

02:44:44.500 --> 02:44:47.620
you could argue well you know Xbox doesn't have hands and feet mode and I

02:44:47.620 --> 02:44:52.380
know that makes a lot of you guys go big fucking deal but they tried to do

02:44:52.380 --> 02:44:55.360
something different with the PlayStation just like they were doing different

02:44:55.360 --> 02:44:59.100
things with UltraMix 2 so I don't want to knock the PlayStation 2 for at least

02:44:59.100 --> 02:45:01.540
trying something different that wasn't there before and it wasn't just the

02:45:01.540 --> 02:45:06.200
itoy things we know some new interface new songs things like that it just you

02:45:06.200 --> 02:45:09.580
know it's not always gonna work a hundred percent of the time but I have

02:45:09.580 --> 02:45:14.000
some faith that they will take the feedback and come out and give us

02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:16.900
something better for the PlayStation next year because I do think it's inevitable we

02:45:16.900 --> 02:45:20.840
will see new releases on Xbox and PlayStation 2 next year. But again, the only way you're

02:45:20.840 --> 02:45:28.920
going to see that is if you buy the damn games. So don't get copies. Buy them and that's it.

02:45:28.920 --> 02:45:33.520
Any other comments on that one?

02:45:33.520 --> 02:45:36.520
Buy. Purchase.

02:45:36.520 --> 02:45:42.240
Absolutely. All right, you see, I'm already getting into the chat room. Big fucking deal.

02:45:42.240 --> 02:45:49.240
Well, you know, it's just they wanted to do something different, they took it in a different direction, and for a lot of us it didn't work. What can you do?

02:45:49.240 --> 02:45:51.240
They think they're not shareholders.

02:45:51.240 --> 02:45:56.240
And then how many crappy songs can you find in Extreme USA versus how many can you find in Ultramix 2?

02:45:56.240 --> 02:46:01.240
Well, I don't know. I mean, I believe, if I'm not mistaken, it's kind of up- I don't know.

02:46:01.240 --> 02:46:04.360
everybody thinks they know but I think

02:46:04.360 --> 02:46:08.380
Japan for the most part did Extreme and Hawaii, well we know Hawaii

02:46:08.380 --> 02:46:11.720
pretty much for the most part did UltraMix 2 with some help from their

02:46:11.720 --> 02:46:15.160
staff in the bay so I don't know

02:46:15.160 --> 02:46:19.660
I don't know anyway it's just different they tried something different and for

02:46:19.660 --> 02:46:21.500
some folks it didn't work

02:46:21.500 --> 02:46:24.740
I don't think it was that bad I still like DDR Extreme I think it has some

02:46:24.740 --> 02:46:28.580
good songs in it, it doesn't have as many good songs as UltraMix 2 granted but

02:46:28.580 --> 02:46:30.700
Maybe Konami will learn something from UltraMix 2.

02:46:30.700 --> 02:46:35.740
They took a risk. They took a really big risk with UltraMix 2, I think, because there were

02:46:35.740 --> 02:46:39.460
going to be... In fact, there were people out there that said it's not Japanese enough.

02:46:39.460 --> 02:46:43.340
It doesn't have enough of the Japanese songs. But I think that's why they went and the Japanese

02:46:43.340 --> 02:46:49.660
songs they picked, they picked very carefully. Moonlight Shadow, Dam Daryam, Volume 4, those

02:46:49.660 --> 02:46:56.420
are all throwbacks to the fans. They didn't pick them because those were songs for the

02:46:56.420 --> 02:47:02.440
fans. Don't doubt it. But it was a risk. I mean, they could have come back, people could

02:47:02.440 --> 02:47:06.160
have said, a different drum sucks, why did you guys put all this fucking synth pop in

02:47:06.160 --> 02:47:10.360
there? And you know there's probably somebody out there who's saying that, but for the most

02:47:10.360 --> 02:47:14.840
part people are taking very well to the new music and hopefully it'll continue. MPQ wants

02:47:14.840 --> 02:47:19.120
to know which is better, paying $400 for a Japanese PlayStation 2 2DX end controller

02:47:19.120 --> 02:47:27.120
or driving 14 hours to Ventura, California to play 2DX. I've done both, sadly enough,

02:47:27.120 --> 02:47:37.660
although my drive was only 8 hours. But, I don't know. You know what, even when you get

02:47:37.660 --> 02:47:41.760
it at home, it doesn't quite compare to the arcade, especially because the consumer releases

02:47:41.760 --> 02:47:46.640
are a little bit behind the arcade releases. So honestly, I wish I could tell you one or

02:47:46.640 --> 02:47:50.960
other was better but face it you're gonna end up doing both just like I did

02:47:50.960 --> 02:47:57.360
it's like masturbation and sex sure masturbation is all right it's not quite

02:47:57.360 --> 02:48:02.920
as good as sex but you know what in the end you're gonna end up doing both

02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:14.480
dot dot dot DD Archaholic says hi Rob Jamie Matt hi I just thought of a super

02:48:14.480 --> 02:48:20.360
idea and wondered what you thought. Would you do an all-night Orange Lounge Radio Marathon

02:48:20.360 --> 02:48:24.040
live show like on a Saturday night? You could do it for charity even.

02:48:24.040 --> 02:48:28.760
That'd be fun. Yes. It'd be like a slumber party with vodka.

02:48:28.760 --> 02:48:34.840
Yes, with one condition. I want an arcade to host it. If we're going to do it overnight,

02:48:34.840 --> 02:48:39.440
I'm not going to do it in this little apartment. I want arcade games and things to do. So if

02:48:39.440 --> 02:48:42.840
we could get an arcade in the Sacramento area to agree to it, and I think if we worked the

02:48:42.840 --> 02:48:47.600
charity angle yes I'm all down for it absolutely I think it could be fun or

02:48:47.600 --> 02:48:53.000
maybe we could talk to our buddy at the theater possibly that might be an idea I

02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:56.400
don't know if they want a big screen uh-huh that's that's an idea well I

02:48:56.400 --> 02:49:00.160
think about that one can you imagine if we could get picked out yet in that

02:49:00.160 --> 02:49:08.000
giant screen that would be so cool sorry the orange lounge lock-in I like the

02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:12.640
idea I like the charity angle especially with Christmas coming up yes

02:49:12.640 --> 02:49:18.240
asylum we lock you in great yeah yeah I'm like the asylum is a dance club

02:49:18.240 --> 02:49:23.560
don't get it confused I really do like that idea and in fact I want to get in

02:49:23.560 --> 02:49:25.840
touch with you later about that DD alcoholic because maybe you can help me

02:49:25.840 --> 02:49:29.320
approach some arcades about it see if anybody would be willing to do it I

02:49:29.320 --> 02:49:32.960
think it'd be fun if not we could just always bring our shit to country club

02:49:32.960 --> 02:49:36.480
lanes because they're open 24 hours anyway but I'm all down for it I think

02:49:36.480 --> 02:49:43.960
be fun. All right. Misty says, what do you guys want for Christmas? Oh, I'm so glad she's

02:49:43.960 --> 02:49:57.800
asking. Money, lots of it. My two front teeth. And some spinach. I want sex. But not from

02:49:57.800 --> 02:50:05.560
Santa. But not with your two. Santa's got years of experience. That's all right. Santa

02:50:05.560 --> 02:50:08.880
would be quite the sugar daddy if you think about it I want someone to pay for

02:50:08.880 --> 02:50:14.600
my plane ticket home oh no in all seriousness what do I want for Christmas

02:50:14.600 --> 02:50:17.160
and all serious I like gift certificates because I like going to buy my own

02:50:17.160 --> 02:50:23.680
things but I want I want more games and I want more I don't know I just want I

02:50:23.680 --> 02:50:27.800
want a big party with like a lot of my friends because I like parties and I

02:50:27.800 --> 02:50:30.920
know some friends of mine are gonna host them so that's cool it works out I'm not

02:50:30.920 --> 02:50:34.520
really big on material things pretty much like if I want something bad enough

02:50:34.520 --> 02:50:39.520
I just go and get it. Honestly, I think the best gifts I've gotten in the past were, like,

02:50:39.520 --> 02:50:44.220
things that people made. Like, one year Sharks Girl made me this collage for my birthday,

02:50:44.220 --> 02:50:48.440
like, because she was really into scrapbooking then. I think she still is a little bit. And

02:50:48.440 --> 02:50:51.760
she made this awesome collage. That was, like, one of the best presents I ever got, seriously.

02:50:51.760 --> 02:50:55.180
I just like little things like that. I mean, you know, I pretty much buy all the things

02:50:55.180 --> 02:50:59.400
I really want, so I don't have a big list of material things. But I like that stuff.

02:50:59.400 --> 02:51:04.300
i think a lot of people like that kind of stuff

02:51:04.300 --> 02:51:08.900
well i'd like money

02:51:08.900 --> 02:51:15.820
but most importantly anything that's priceless really

02:51:15.820 --> 02:51:16.620
all right

02:51:16.620 --> 02:51:18.940
uh... let's go on to

02:51:18.940 --> 02:51:21.260
somebody else uh... another question

02:51:21.260 --> 02:51:23.560
d j ron mass d s says

02:51:23.560 --> 02:51:24.500
my question

02:51:24.500 --> 02:51:28.860
will you and the rest of orange lounge radio be suicidal enough to go shopping

02:51:28.860 --> 02:51:33.660
on Black Friday, which is, of course, the day after Thanksgiving. Biggest shopping day

02:51:33.660 --> 02:51:35.940
of the year. Any plans to go shopping? Jamie?

02:51:35.940 --> 02:51:40.980
Um, yeah, actually I am. But you're going to be in Alabama then, right?

02:51:40.980 --> 02:51:43.140
But yeah, I'm still going to be doing some shopping. Still pretty crazy.

02:51:43.140 --> 02:51:45.660
Actually, no, that's that Friday. I'm actually going to be in Dothan.

02:51:45.660 --> 02:51:48.860
Oh, okay. Um, but I am.

02:51:48.860 --> 02:51:53.300
Oh my God, that's where my boss is from. That's so funny. That's funny.

02:51:53.300 --> 02:51:57.140
I'll go bomb them for you. No, not my boss's house, what Loki said. I

02:51:57.140 --> 02:52:09.140
As far as shopping, no. I don't plan on going to the mall that day. There's nothing that exciting about it for me. I'm going to stay home and masturbate all day. No, I'm kidding. I don't know what I'm going to do.

02:52:09.140 --> 02:52:14.460
I may make it out if I have stuff to buy I don't know I have to think of what I

02:52:14.460 --> 02:52:22.180
want to buy depends if I have my money by then which I hopefully will so yeah I

02:52:22.180 --> 02:52:26.540
just want to sleep and play Final Fantasy and Ultramix too is that so

02:52:26.540 --> 02:52:31.580
wrong I mean I don't wanna go shopping I want to stay home maybe get Mongolian

02:52:31.580 --> 02:52:38.220

thanksgiving day table aka unique side dishes out of the norm

02:52:43.580 --> 02:52:47.180
jamie what do you think might be a unique dish on your table

02:52:47.180 --> 02:52:50.940

02:52:52.140 --> 02:52:53.260
you're for real

02:52:53.260 --> 02:52:56.500
i have no idea

02:52:56.500 --> 02:53:00.380
we don't really have many out of the ordinary things

02:53:00.380 --> 02:53:02.900
i don't really know who's going to be cooking thanksgiving dinner

02:53:02.900 --> 02:53:04.620
when i'm there so i'm just gonna

02:53:04.620 --> 02:53:07.120
They put food in front of me. I'm off the diet today. Feed me.

02:53:08.120 --> 02:53:11.120
And remember, don't eat in DDR.

02:53:11.120 --> 02:53:17.120
Oh, but I should take a minute to plug the special that our buddies over on DDR Freak Radio are doing on Thanksgiving.

02:53:17.120 --> 02:53:20.120
They're doing, like, an all-day marathon of DDR, like, back-to-back.

02:53:20.120 --> 02:53:24.120
Like, non-stop till your brain explodes. Seriously, it's gonna be cool.

02:53:24.120 --> 02:53:27.120
Like, what? Second mix, third mix, fourth mix, all of it, back-to-back.

02:53:27.120 --> 02:53:29.120
What time are they starting over there? Nine, ten o'clock?

02:53:29.120 --> 02:53:31.120
I don't know. Check DDRFreak.com for the details.

02:53:31.120 --> 02:53:32.120
Go to DDRFreak, yeah.

02:53:32.120 --> 02:53:34.940
yeah I mean like like you don't go there anyway but you know I just want to get

02:53:34.940 --> 02:53:40.740
that plug out there don't forget all right let's see moving on oh my my dish

02:53:40.740 --> 02:53:45.040
at my table we don't I don't eat turkey I hate turkey so Thanksgiving is a

02:53:45.040 --> 02:53:48.740
really shitty holiday for me but my mom says she will be cooking ham and I like

02:53:48.740 --> 02:53:51.820
him and she actually says she might just be ready to say fuck it and order a

02:53:51.820 --> 02:53:54.820
pizza which I've been telling her to do for years so we might do that

02:53:54.820 --> 02:54:01.820
Dark Tetsuya said, have any of you picked up Metal Gear Solid 3 yet? If so, what do you think so far?

02:54:24.820 --> 02:54:34.060
Rumbleroses is every cheesy thing you would want it to be. It is so horrifically bad in

02:54:34.060 --> 02:54:42.140
a great way. Last question. Oh, not really a question, but a comment from DDRchaholic

02:54:42.140 --> 02:54:48.840
says, sounds good, I'll make calls and stuff. Good, good deal. Maybe we'll open up the Skype

02:54:48.840 --> 02:54:52.580
line for like one quick call if anybody wants to get in there. I don't know, we'll open

02:54:52.580 --> 02:54:58.540
it up, see if anybody wants to call. A lot of good questions. Next week on the show,

02:54:58.540 --> 02:55:02.180
don't forget that Midihead is going to be interviewed. That's something we're really

02:55:02.180 --> 02:55:05.400
looking forward to. It's going to be good to talk to him. I want to know if he remixed,

02:55:05.400 --> 02:55:08.800
if he's remixed anything else. That's what I want to know. Because that, in my eyes,

02:55:08.800 --> 02:55:12.780
remix is damn good. So I want to know if there's anything else there. You can visit his site

02:55:12.780 --> 02:55:19.060
over at midihead.com, of course, and hopefully we get more people in the future as well.

02:55:19.060 --> 02:55:21.940
Alright, Siggy's calling back. I think he has a question or comment. Hey Siggy, what's

02:55:21.940 --> 02:55:22.940
Hey, what's up?

02:55:22.940 --> 02:55:23.940
Hey, what's up?

02:55:23.940 --> 02:55:26.900
I've forgotten one more thing you mentioned about 2DX8 style.

02:55:26.900 --> 02:55:27.900
Do it.

02:55:27.900 --> 02:55:32.460
Yeah, it's an option called random plus.

02:55:32.460 --> 02:55:33.460
Random plus?

02:55:33.460 --> 02:55:34.460
And what does that do?

02:55:34.460 --> 02:55:40.500
Oh, it's the same thing as random, only you do it, it scratches, it scratches included

02:55:40.500 --> 02:55:41.980
in it.

02:55:41.980 --> 02:55:42.980
Interesting.

02:55:42.980 --> 02:55:43.980
Huh.

02:55:43.980 --> 02:55:44.980
Yeah.

02:55:44.980 --> 02:55:56.980
And the way you access Random Plus is hold the key wherever the random is for at least a few seconds, and the random will turn red.

02:55:56.980 --> 02:55:58.980
Huh, okay.

02:55:58.980 --> 02:56:00.980
And that's how you access Random Plus.

02:56:00.980 --> 02:56:05.980
Yeah, supposedly you have to do something before that, but I'll do that, but I don't know.

02:56:05.980 --> 02:56:07.980
So maybe it's an unlock, we'll see.

02:56:07.980 --> 02:56:10.980
Alright, I'm gonna go and take another call real fast, Ziggybed. Thanks for calling.

02:56:10.980 --> 02:56:11.980
Alright.

02:56:11.980 --> 02:56:12.980
Have a good one.

02:56:12.980 --> 02:56:26.980
Hi, it's MPQ.

02:56:26.980 --> 02:56:29.540
Hello MPQ, what's on your mind?

02:56:29.540 --> 02:56:36.540
I was just wondering if I have any right to complain about 2DX when I have a pop-up music machine within driving distance.

02:56:36.540 --> 02:56:38.100
Um...

02:56:38.100 --> 02:56:41.140
I don't know, what do you guys think? Does he have a right to complain about 2DX?

02:56:41.140 --> 02:56:44.700
What mix of pop-up music is it?

02:56:44.700 --> 02:56:47.700
Well, see, now 5DX is kind of old. I mean, it's good, but it's old.

02:56:47.700 --> 02:56:49.100
Yeah, you can complain.

02:56:49.100 --> 02:56:54.340
I'd say you still have a right to complain, but not as much as the rest of us, okay?

02:56:54.340 --> 02:56:56.020
Alright.

02:56:56.020 --> 02:56:59.860
Have a good one. Bye.

02:56:59.860 --> 02:57:03.300
Alright, we've got to wrap up the show. Sorry to keep these calls quick, but we do need to wrap

02:57:03.300 --> 02:57:07.340
things up, and that means we've got to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

02:57:07.340 --> 02:57:11.220
Arkadian, your final thought?

02:57:11.220 --> 02:57:13.780
Ooh, yay. Horday weekend coming up.

02:57:13.780 --> 02:57:16.700
Did I hear that?

02:57:16.700 --> 02:57:17.420
Uh...

02:57:17.420 --> 02:57:21.860
Explicit, your final thought?

02:57:21.860 --> 02:57:24.660
Ooh, Thanksgiving.

02:57:24.660 --> 02:57:28.460
turkey

02:57:28.460 --> 02:57:33.420
uh... look here but about

02:57:33.420 --> 02:57:36.660
i know there's codes out there i've seen them before

02:57:36.660 --> 02:57:41.020
for grand theft house andrea's re-commodified damage that each gun does

02:57:41.020 --> 02:57:45.940
and i can't find them for the life of me and that pisses me off

02:57:45.940 --> 02:57:48.240
that mom

02:57:48.240 --> 02:57:50.100
yeah i'd need to

02:57:50.100 --> 02:57:53.480
by smart answer the s

02:57:53.480 --> 02:57:59.480
My final thought is, um, I don't want to get up and fly tomorrow. It sucks.

02:57:59.480 --> 02:58:03.480
And you know, I left my email with all my travel information at work.

02:58:03.480 --> 02:58:07.480
But I know what flight I'm on and everything, so hopefully I don't have a problem, or else I'm screwed. We'll see.

02:58:07.480 --> 02:58:08.480
Jamie, your final thought?

02:58:08.480 --> 02:58:14.480
My final thought is, God damn you people, sign up for stuff and give me my iPod.

02:58:14.480 --> 02:58:16.480
Oh God, you didn't get suckered into that too, did you?

02:58:16.480 --> 02:58:20.480
Well, no, it's just because it's an experiment, so I want help.

02:58:20.480 --> 02:58:20.480
Okay.

02:58:20.480 --> 02:58:21.480
You'll help me while you're up?

02:58:21.480 --> 02:58:24.480
No. I don't buy into that shit.

02:58:24.480 --> 02:58:26.480
I'm gonna get my mom to sign up.

02:58:26.480 --> 02:58:28.480
Have fun.

02:58:28.480 --> 02:58:32.480
It's more of an experiment, I don't really care, it's just more of an experiment, just to see.

02:58:32.480 --> 02:58:37.480
Because I found that if you do the Blockbuster thing, you can cancel it before they charge you with anything.

02:58:37.480 --> 02:58:39.480
Yeah, you can.

02:58:39.480 --> 02:58:43.480
I decided it's fun, it's a distraction, so why not?

02:58:43.480 --> 02:58:46.480
Why not? I just don't want spam.

02:58:46.480 --> 02:58:50.480
So, looking forward to going to Alip- oh, this one doesn't give you any spam mail.

02:58:50.480 --> 02:58:54.340
We'll see. I'm looking forward to going to Alabama, getting the hell out of this state.

02:58:54.340 --> 02:59:01.660
Oh, gee, thank you. We'll miss you too. I'm not meaning the people, I'm meaning the other people that don't exist in my universe.

02:59:01.660 --> 02:59:05.180
That's fine. Um, I guess that's it.

02:59:05.180 --> 02:59:09.580
Tune in next week for more fun on the show and hopefully, what I'm kinda hoping

02:59:09.580 --> 02:59:12.620
is that maybe we can get Karaoke Revolution 3 next week because you know

02:59:12.620 --> 02:59:13.700
when Jamie leaves

02:59:13.700 --> 02:59:17.100
Matt has to sing. It's tradition.

02:59:17.100 --> 02:59:23.100
So we'll see what we can do. I'm totally gonna see if Iguana Girl can come over and bring over her copy of Karaoke Revolution 3.

02:59:23.100 --> 02:59:26.100
I'm gonna see if we can work something out. We'll see.

02:59:26.100 --> 02:59:29.100
If not, I'm just gonna go buy the damn thing so we can do that.

02:59:29.100 --> 02:59:32.100
Anyway, thanks everybody for listening. Have a great night.

02:59:32.100 --> 02:59:35.100
The final word of the show. You know what? I'm taking the final word of the show.

02:59:35.100 --> 02:59:38.100
I never get the final word of the show. It's my turn, dammit.

02:59:38.100 --> 02:59:40.100
One word that sums everything up.

02:59:41.100 --> 02:59:43.100
Pictochat.

02:59:43.100 --> 02:59:49.100

He'll say, are you ready? We'll say, whoa, man, let's wait until the wife is out of town.

03:01:08.100 --> 03:01:17.100
Later on, if you wanna, we can dress like my daughter.

03:01:17.100 --> 03:01:21.100
Put on some ice shades and join the parade.

03:01:21.100 --> 03:01:25.100
Walk around and live as underwear.

03:01:25.100 --> 03:01:32.100
Lacy jeans Missed hand, didn't ask

03:01:32.100 --> 03:01:38.100
Urban shine Wearing her clothes, silk pantyhose

03:01:38.100 --> 03:01:42.100

Walking round in women's underwear

the orange lines radio after birth here it is

03:02:28.260 --> 03:02:31.500
Jamie why the Christmas songs already

03:02:31.500 --> 03:02:36.100
because I figured if our major department stores can do it and Walgreens can so can I

03:02:36.100 --> 03:02:39.260
oh my god are they playing Christmas songs at Walgreens already

03:02:39.260 --> 03:02:43.660
it's got the Christmas stuff up

03:02:43.660 --> 03:02:47.140
went to Walmart the other day because we were

03:02:47.140 --> 03:02:50.940
we went to buy go silly headgear and stuff

03:02:50.940 --> 03:02:55.780
and a headgear. Huh? They bought party hats, Care Bears party hats this year.

03:02:55.780 --> 03:02:59.940
Um, but uh, they already had like a whole Christmas section open.

03:02:59.940 --> 03:03:02.940
It was kinda stupid.

03:03:02.940 --> 03:03:08.780
Oh well. And to answer the question in the chat room, yes that was from the Bob and Tom show, right?

03:03:08.780 --> 03:03:14.240
Yes indeed. Right Chan says it's funny to go into Walmart and walk around in the

03:03:14.240 --> 03:03:17.340
women's section looking for stuff. My mom and my dad's just start singing

03:03:17.340 --> 03:03:19.060
walk around in women's underwear.

03:03:19.060 --> 03:03:22.060
Get it? Because you're in the department?

03:03:25.060 --> 03:03:27.060
I thought it was funny.

03:03:27.060 --> 03:03:29.060
It is funny.

03:03:31.060 --> 03:03:35.060
So when do you go on your great adventure, Dark Sakura?

03:03:35.060 --> 03:03:39.060
I'm flying out Wednesday at 2.45. Who wants to drive me to the airport?

03:03:39.060 --> 03:03:42.060
I would, but I'm working.

03:03:42.060 --> 03:03:45.060
I'm still trying to find a way to the airport.

03:03:45.060 --> 03:03:48.820
Oh, shoot. Well, you can always do a shuttle? I don't know.

03:03:48.820 --> 03:03:50.260
I'm working it out, don't worry.

03:03:50.260 --> 03:03:51.940
Okay, that's good.

03:03:51.940 --> 03:03:55.620
Alright, I guess we'll just kind of keep it a short afterbirth tonight then,

03:03:55.620 --> 03:03:59.140
since a lot of you guys don't have anything else to say.

03:03:59.140 --> 03:04:03.620
But, I know we didn't get to a lot of those UltraMix II MP3s,

03:04:03.620 --> 03:04:06.740
so I'm going to put in the rest right now so you guys can hear it,

03:04:06.740 --> 03:04:10.740
because I bet you guys, some of you guys were waiting to hear some of the rest of those songs.

03:04:10.740 --> 03:04:14.020
So we will get to those right now. We're going to start it with Jam on it,

03:04:14.020 --> 03:04:23.020
And La Cucaracha, Life Is A Game, Looking For You, Mellow, Monkey Punk, Play My Game, and Red Room.

03:04:23.020 --> 03:04:27.020
All those songs you're going to hear right now.

03:04:27.020 --> 03:04:32.020
It's a block of Ultramix 2 music. Enjoy, you guys.

03:04:32.020 --> 03:04:36.020
I have to set it up here. Sorry. Here we go. Now we can do it.

03:05:02.020 --> 03:05:06.020
Well damn and honest what we do best is what separates us from the rest

03:05:06.020 --> 03:05:08.020
And if you don't think I cruise down for real

03:05:08.020 --> 03:05:10.020
Let me tell you what happened to the man to see

03:05:10.020 --> 03:05:14.020
A Superman had come to die to see who he could rock

03:05:14.020 --> 03:05:18.020
He blew away every crew he sent until he reached our block

03:05:18.020 --> 03:05:22.020
His speakers were restored and I was what was made of steel

03:05:22.020 --> 03:05:25.020
And when we bought our set outside he said

03:05:25.020 --> 03:05:27.020
I'll be real

03:05:27.020 --> 03:05:29.020
Well Superman looked up at me

03:05:29.020 --> 03:05:31.020
He said you rock so naturally

03:05:31.020 --> 03:05:35.020
I said, now that you've learned the deal, let me tell you why I'm so real.

03:05:35.020 --> 03:05:37.020
I'm Cosmo D from outer space.

03:05:37.020 --> 03:05:39.020
I came to rock for you and great.

03:05:39.020 --> 03:05:40.020
I'm good, right?

03:05:40.020 --> 03:05:41.020
Because I can't do it wrong.

03:05:41.020 --> 03:05:43.020
That's why the whole world is singin' this song.

03:05:43.020 --> 03:05:44.020
Jam on it.

03:05:44.020 --> 03:05:45.020
I jam on it.

03:05:45.020 --> 03:05:47.020
I say jam, j-j-j-jam on it.

03:05:47.020 --> 03:05:51.020
And day to the night and night turns to day, whatever time it is, I wanna hear you say.

03:05:51.020 --> 03:05:52.020
Jam on it.

03:05:52.020 --> 03:05:53.020
I jam on it.

03:05:53.020 --> 03:05:55.020
I say jam, m-m-mama jam on it.

03:05:55.020 --> 03:05:57.020
Jam on around and upside down.

03:05:57.020 --> 03:06:00.020
I keep a jam into the jam on production sound.

03:06:00.020 --> 03:06:05.020
Demone, Demone, Demone, Demone, Demone

03:08:00.020 --> 03:08:07.020

Don't you try to run, don't you try to hide Life is a game, let's play tonight

03:09:32.020 --> 03:10:00.020
All right, then when I find you, I'll give you love, just a smile, just a smile, I'll

I'll give you love, it's all the harm you

03:10:06.820 --> 03:10:10.820
I don't wanna make you scream out

03:10:10.820 --> 03:10:14.820
No no no no no, without the count

03:10:14.820 --> 03:10:39.620
We're looking for you in the city We're looking for you tonight, tonight

03:10:39.620 --> 03:10:41.620
Innocent take

03:10:42.620 --> 03:10:43.620

03:10:47.620 --> 03:10:48.620
Oh!

03:10:50.620 --> 03:10:52.620
It's all behind you

03:10:52.620 --> 03:10:55.620

03:10:57.620 --> 03:11:00.620
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

03:11:05.620 --> 03:11:07.620
Innocent take

03:11:37.620 --> 03:11:42.620
...

03:11:42.620 --> 03:11:47.620
...

03:11:47.620 --> 03:11:52.620
...

03:11:52.620 --> 03:11:57.620
...

03:11:57.620 --> 03:12:02.620
...

03:12:02.620 --> 03:12:06.620
the

03:12:06.620 --> 03:12:10.620
the

03:12:10.620 --> 03:12:14.620
the

03:12:14.620 --> 03:12:18.620
the

03:12:18.620 --> 03:12:22.620
the

03:12:22.620 --> 03:12:26.620
the

03:12:26.620 --> 03:12:30.620
the

03:13:00.620 --> 03:13:28.620
We didn't have to go too far, we didn't have to go too far.

03:13:28.620 --> 03:13:36.620
First thing first, we got some ice cream And then we headed over to Gee's The Monkey

03:13:36.620 --> 03:13:41.620
Stuck my tongue out and made the monkey frown Tryin' to be cool with my friends around

03:13:41.620 --> 03:13:46.620
But the guess we had, enough of me Cause when I turned my head, he stole my ice cream

03:13:46.620 --> 03:13:51.620
That little monkey stole my ice cream And everybody laughed at me

03:13:51.620 --> 03:13:57.620
That little monkey stole my ice cream And everybody made fun of me

03:13:57.620 --> 03:14:01.620
That little monkey made a monkey out of me

03:14:02.620 --> 03:14:07.620
And the day came to an end We walked right by the monkey again

03:14:07.620 --> 03:14:13.620
And then as we were swinging from tree to tree I swear that monkey was laughing at me

03:14:13.620 --> 03:14:24.620
With a monkey, with a monkey, don't monkey

03:14:24.620 --> 03:14:29.620
That little monkey made a monkey out of me

03:14:29.620 --> 03:14:34.620
That little monkey made a monkey out of me

03:14:34.620 --> 03:14:38.620
with a monkey, with a monkey, no monkey

03:14:38.620 --> 03:14:41.620
with a monkey, no monkey

03:14:41.620 --> 03:14:46.620
with a monkey, that little monkey made a monkey out of me

03:14:46.620 --> 03:14:50.620
Turn the page and rock your body

03:15:20.620 --> 03:15:44.380
Say my name, I feel I'm burning up inside Play my game, I'm losing my mind

03:16:14.380 --> 03:16:40.380
Turn the page and rock your body Turn the page and rock your body

03:16:44.380 --> 03:16:48.380
The

03:16:48.380 --> 03:16:52.380
The

03:16:52.380 --> 03:16:56.380
The

03:16:56.380 --> 03:17:00.380
The

03:17:00.380 --> 03:17:04.380
The

03:17:04.380 --> 03:17:08.380
The

03:17:08.380 --> 03:17:12.380
The

03:18:12.380 --> 03:18:37.100
All right, that was all the new DDR UltraMix II songs that we didn't get to during the

03:18:37.100 --> 03:18:38.100
live show tonight.

03:18:38.100 --> 03:18:42.340
Jam on it, La Cucaracha, Life is a Game, look at, excuse me.
