1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,800
All the time we'll be together

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,500
Cause it's yours and mine

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,500
Forever we're in this love scene

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,500
Now it's me watching you and you're watching me

5
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,500
But I was too blind, I just couldn't see

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,500
You were out on the floor, looking so fine

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,500
I never really thought I'd ever be blind

8
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,500
But it went on and on and on

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,500
I look in on the dance floor and see what's gone

10
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,500
The heart was the one that's the last one to jump

11
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,500
Everybody needs a promise cause of my choice

12
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,500
I can have me close and complete

13
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,500
No longer anybody that I want to see

14
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,500
Will I want to live my life without losing my mind?

15
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,500
Until the day I die

16
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,500
I'll be your everything

17
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:54,500
And whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

18
00:00:54,500 --> 00:01:03,500
Close your tape ahead, but I won't be a man So look tonight, we're gonna dance the night away

19
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:11,500
One and one is two, don't you be so cruel Synchronize as love is what we got to do

20
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:19,500
All the time we'll be together, cause it's yours and mine Forever we're in this love chain

21
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:26,500
I will be your friend, so tonight we're gonna miss the night away

22
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:30,500
One and one is two, don't you be the crew

23
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:34,500
Synchronize this love, it's what we've got to do

24
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:40,500
All the time we'll be together, cause it's yours and mine

25
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,500
And find forever we're in this long way

And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting

114
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:17,860
as they debate some of the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.

115
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:23,860
Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bamani Music & More program. Can we talk about that?

116
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,860
No subject will ever be taboo.

117
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:29,860
Well, I was thinking maybe we should move, pump up the volume from Tuesday nights?

118
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:32,860
Except of course the subject that was just under discussion.

119
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:38,860
Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?

120
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,860
I collect your fucking head.

121
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,860
Just like this fucker here.

122
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,860
Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki?

123
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:52,860
The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!

124
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,860
Now if any of you sons of bitches

125
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,860
got anything else to say,

126
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:00,860
Now's the fucking time!

127
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:28,860
Three.

128
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,860
Didn't you just say you were sick, Navi?

129
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:31,860
As of today.

130
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:32,860
As of this afternoon.

131
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:33,860
Four.

132
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:34,860
It's a sick club.

133
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:39,340
Half the folks in here are in the sick club right now, so I'm a little worried.

134
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:42,940
I hope we don't catch it, but I think everybody's past contagious stage.

135
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:47,060
If I exhale hard enough, I can make the raspy voice hot.

136
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:51,620
I've got the rockin pneumonia and the boogie woogie flu, does that count?

137
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,620
The boogie woogie flu?

138
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,620
It's a song.

139
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,620
Have you ever heard?

140
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,620
No.

141
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,980
I cannot believe you've never heard that song.

142
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:01,820
Maybe I have heard it and I just forgot it, because it sucked.

143
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:02,820
I don't know.

144
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:03,820
It doesn't suck.

145
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:04,820
Just kidding.

146
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,820
Classic.

147
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:06,820
Anyway, if you're just joining us, welcome to the show.

148
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,420
We do have a whole lot of special guests here in studio tonight.

149
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:15,020
Flo walks here, Sharks Girl, Islander, Iguana Girl, Navi, Arcadian42, and then of course

150
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,020
myself, DarkSakura and Loki, all here.

151
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,260
So it's a crowded house.

152
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:23,660
A good way to come back from episode, or I should say a non-episode, not having a show

153
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,660
for a week.

154
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:25,660
So it's a good way to come back.

155
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:29,860
But we're going to start off tonight's show as we start off every week, this week being

156
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:33,600
no different, and I want to know, how was your week and how was your day?

157
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,740
And also tonight, a bonus question, how was your Halloween?

158
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:39,700
Jamie, start us off as you always do.

159
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:43,840
My Halloween, well we did the thing at work and I was wearing these fuzzy leg warmers

160
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:48,160
and fuzzy arm warmers and had cat ears and a tail, and went around playing with yarn

161
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,820
and blah, that was it.

162
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:57,040
We had Rocky though on Saturday night, well technically Sunday morning, Saturday night.

163
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,040
And I got to play with lights.

164
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,040
Wow, it sucked.

165
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:07,900
No, I just, I didn't, I don't think I had enough time to get used to it but it was cool.

166
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:13,360
And then Halloween, I was just sort of like, dress up, what's that?

167
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,880
And the rest of the week was all busy, busy, busy.

168
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:24,280
had fun yesterday hanging out. Lots of fun. So, that was it. I kept this one short because

169
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:28,040
we have a lot of people. I know, wow. I'm shocked. Usually you have like a fifteen minute

170
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:32,720
monologue. It's amazing. I'm just kidding. Alright, Flo Walk, how you doing? How was

171
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,880
your week? How was your day? How was your Halloween? Let's see, Halloween. Gosh, I really

172
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,920
can't remember much of it because there just really wasn't a bunch of Halloween type stuff

173
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:45,760
going on. I didn't get a chance to break out my Lucas from the Wizard costume. Aww, I bet

174
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:52,760
it was so bad. Indeed it was. But uh, let's see, as far as the week goes, gosh man, I

175
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:56,280
think... I just have to interject though. You went to Classic Gaming Expo, of course

176
00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:00,000
you were there, and I think most, well a few people in this room went to Classic Gaming

177
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,600
Expo. I don't know how many of you guys saw the power glove that was in the room, like

178
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,800
where they were showing all the old stuff. Every time people would walk by it, like every

179
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:16,760
the other person would go, it's so bad. Myself included. Myself included. Anyway, sorry to

180
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:23,080
interrupt. It's cool. Let's see, as far as the week goes, gosh, I think I probably speak

181
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:27,820
like just everyone else. I've probably been sucked up in way too many video games to count.

182
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:32,260
I mean, Katamari's just been giving me eye strain like a mother. Although, for those

183
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,640
who have played, I don't know if anyone else has gone a perfect 10 meters on the North

184
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:40,640
I have it! I got it on my second try, I'm a weirdo!

185
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:11,320
mine, so, hey. And then today is just, of course, you know, always making the track

186
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:16,560
up from the South Bay up here and jamming to Sirius Radio, which is like the greatest

187
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:22,540
invention next to the iPod. And here we are now, and it only gets better from here.

188
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,680
Is Sirius the one that's getting Howard Stern?

189
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,680
Yes, it is.

190
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,680
Okay.

191
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,000
I was checking out, because I need to get my car stereo replaced, and I was kind of

192
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,080
thinking about it. Think about it. We'll see.

193
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:36,580
Sirius went from 600,000 customers to just under a million in less than a month on that

194
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,580
one announcement alone.

195
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,580
Figures.

196
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:39,580
And I'm one of them.

197
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:40,580
No surprises.

198
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:47,780
It would be my dream one day to get this shit on satellite radio, but yeah, I'm not holding

199
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:50,140
my breath on that one.

200
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:53,460
But I did see one of those things at Best Buy, it's like a stereo where you can listen

201
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,260
to internet radio like anywhere in your house.

202
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:58,460
It looked pretty cool, it was $180, but it looked pretty cool.

203
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,780
And hopefully, you know, in about a year, technology comes down.

204
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:01,780
So, anyway.

205
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:02,780
Yeah, hi.

206
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,780
Uh, Sharkskull, how was your week?

207
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:05,780
How was your day?

208
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,780
How was your Halloween?

209
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:10,300
Um, I don't even remember what I did for Halloween, really.

210
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,140
Is this thing working or no?

211
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,140
It's working.

212
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,940
I just, I'm gonna go back and make sure the audio levels are up sexy.

213
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:15,940
Okay, cool.

214
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,980
But, um, yeah, I just kinda hung out for Halloween.

215
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:18,980
It was boring.

216
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:21,940
Um, avoided little kids, things like that.

217
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:27,300
Week, I've been sleeping a lot and kind of feeling crappy and, yeah, then we came up

218
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:32,220
here and I've been all of a sudden my allergies went haaaaaa and now I feel like I'm about

219
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:39,220
to die. Welcome to Sacramento. Yeah, no kidding. But that's okay. So yeah, it's been fun. It's

220
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:45,720
just been a day. I sleep a lot nowadays. You went shopping today, right? I bought shoes.

221
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,600
I was a good girl and I only came back with one pair. Are you one of those girls that

222
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:55,640
has like a hundred pairs of shoes in their closet? Twenty. Well, that's probably average

223
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,820
for a lot of girls I know and the scary thing is I haven't bought any shoes in

224
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:02,380
like two years and then in like the past probably nine months I bought like ten

225
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:08,320
pair I get them like all the time people are threatening to call me a melda okay

226
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,380
I'm not even gonna joke with you I'm one of my best friends in high school who I

227
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:14,600
used to do my public access show with back in the day she had a hundred pairs

228
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:19,700
of shoes in her closet like there's not enough days in the year to wear all those

229
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:23,740
have you worn every one of those pairs each one day at least she's like I think

230
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:27,740
Hey, I went through my shoe stash the other day and I was like, I don't even remember

231
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:32,740
buying these things. What the hell? These are cute. Now I'm wearing them.

232
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:38,740
Alright, cool. Alright. Well, let's talk to Islander. Hello. How was your week? How was

233
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:44,740
your day? How was your Halloween? Um, week's gonna be just fine. Um, the only one who's

234
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:50,740
like, not sick, thanks to this like, freakishly good immune system. Yeah, like, no seriously,

235
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:59,740
No seriously, Jessica just shakes her head. As you can see on camera, she's giving me the finger, because I hardly ever get sick, and I don't know why.

236
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,740
It's the RTF jeans.

237
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:03,740
Thank you. Yeah, it definitely is. It must be the RTF jeans.

238
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,740
That's why it doesn't happen often.

239
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:16,740
But no, Halloween was basically my day to recover from Rocky. And what was really funny was that after dinner, we went and got some food.

240
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:30,740
I've seen more and more kids are starting to go to the balls and stuff.

241
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:52,340
Did I tell you one day I saw the Madden 2005 bus broke down on the side of the road?

242
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,340
Are you serious?

243
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,340
Pretty fucking funny.

244
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:59,660
On the 680, on the 680, I was driving down, I think it was one time I was coming to see

245
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:03,260
you one day, Sharkscar, I was driving down 680 and there was the bus broke down on the

246
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,260
side of the road.

247
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,260
I was like, that is hilarious!

248
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:10,140
I talked about that like weeks ago on Outside the Bus, but yeah, it was crazy.

249
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,140
Funny.

250
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,140
Anyway, let's move on.

251
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,460
And Iguana Girl, welcome back.

252
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,460
Thank you.

253
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,460
It's been a little while.

254
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,460
It's been quite a while since you and I have been on a show together.

255
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,460
Wow.

256
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,460
It's kind of like a reunion.

257
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:25,300
Oh my god, oh my god, it's 2001 all over again.

258
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,180
I'm glad we can be candid about it, though.

259
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,180
Seriously.

260
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,180
It's good.

261
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:34,900
I mean, for those who don't know, Guanagirl and I weren't the best of friends for years.

262
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:35,900
To put it lightly.

263
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:36,900
Yes.

264
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:40,380
Which, you know, but, you know, time heals things, and now we're just...

265
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:44,260
And we've got a bunch of big balls, and we've sucked them up, and...

266
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:47,260
Yeah, you know, we just, you know, kissed and made up. Well, without the kissing.

267
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,260
Mwah!

268
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:53,260
And, uh, you know, but it's worked out good, and, you know, everybody always thought there was this big, like,

269
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:57,260
oh, Orange Lounge versus DDR Freak, because you are the goddess behind DDR Freak Radio.

270
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:02,260
And everybody's always been like, oh, you know, it's, oh, Orange Lounge versus DDR Freak, and not really.

271
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:06,260
Yeah, we know, I've been sitting here going, uh, don't I do both?

272
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,260
Yeah.

273
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:12,260
But no, it's good to have you on, and certainly, if you want to make a plug for DDR Freak Radio, go ahead.

274
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:20,520
in a DDR3 radio? Because, I think there's, I think there's like, I think there's like,

275
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:27,280
I think there's 90,000 some odd stations on Live 365. I haven't checked. There are many

276
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:33,960
more stations that we could pick on besides DDR3 radio. Is the tickling guy a station?

277
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:38,960
That's what I want to know. Oh my god, the tickling guy. For those that don't know, Guana

278
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,180
I used to do a show way back in the day under sedation live which is still on the air

279
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:46,780
It just doesn't have us on it anymore, but it's got the very level kind of move to Texas

280
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:50,160
So you know show when I moved to Texas, but it does have the very lovely

281
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,160
Jenna, I can't remember

282
00:23:54,400 --> 00:24:00,480
Yes, so they still on the air so check them out under station live org and sometimes you can even hear the old episodes have

283
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:05,800
I've gone a girl and I on them so so we're reunited in our other names mind you

284
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:12,640
Anyway, enough of that. How was your week? How was your day? How was your Halloween?

285
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,520
My Halloween was, as most other people in this room, or a good portion of the other

286
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:23,640
people in this room, would be spent at Rocky Horror. I played Columbia, and got to get

287
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:29,840
all dressed up in all the sequins, and do my hair, and all that fun jazz, and bounce

288
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:37,480
around and hoped that my top didn't fall off. And then after that Halloween I got cheat

289
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:43,360
night. I actually got to have, yay, cheat night. Got to go to Old Spaghetti Factory

290
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:51,200
and eat those nasty carbs and all that fun schnaz. This week unfortunately has been spent

291
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:59,120
being sick. Sick work school. Sick work school. That's like my mantra this week. So I ended

292
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:04,860
I'm going to take a couple days off of work, which sucked, and today has been pretty neato

293
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:05,860
mosquito.

294
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:08,600
Yesterday was pretty neato mosquito, because I got to spend a lot of time with Ms. Dark

295
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:13,360
Sakura, and today's been all spiffy, because I get to spend it with everybody else.

296
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,600
So I'm in a relatively good mood, and hopefully I won't be, like, coughing too hard.

297
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,600
All right.

298
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,200
Well, that's okay.

299
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,520
There's only, like, so many mics, so hopefully you won't have the microphone when it's time

300
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,520
to cough.

301
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,520
Anyway, moving on.

302
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,520
Navi.

303
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:36,200
I'm holding the mic with my sleeve to be courteous to other people because I'm just now breeding

304
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,780
my germs today.

305
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,780
How was your week?

306
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:40,780
How was your day?

307
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:41,780
How was your Halloween?

308
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:42,780
Halloween.

309
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:43,780
I was at work.

310
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:44,780
I did nothing.

311
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:45,780
There was no reason to dress up.

312
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:46,780
I work in a deli.

313
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:51,820
I have a costume that smelled like bleach and meat when I come home.

314
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:55,740
My week, well actually the past couple weeks have just been way too busy for me.

315
00:25:55,740 --> 00:26:00,940
I don't know, shit's been falling apart at work and I've been working like 46, 48 hours

316
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:01,940
a week.

317
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:04,940
So I'm actually kind of looking forward to being sick right now, hoping it lands on a

318
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,380
day that I don't have off.

319
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,500
You know what?

320
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:11,060
Overtime pay rocks though when you've got, and I know you'll be in the import bar, you've

321
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,060
got what?

322
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,060
Eight coming out?

323
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,060
Yeah.

324
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,060
There's crap coming out.

325
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:19,140
But you know, on my paychecks right now, they're almost double what I normally get.

326
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:24,860
But all I've been really buying are all my little collectible stuff, but I don't have

327
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:25,860
any more room.

328
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:29,860
I don't even have room for the stuff that's coming in the mail this week.

329
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:34,340
I actually have over $100 left out of my paycheck this week, so I don't know what's going on

330
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,340
with that.

331
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:36,780
So I'm just going to take some time off and do something.

332
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:41,020
You've got to tell that cold to hold off about a week, so you can get sick on the 15th of

333
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,020
November.

334
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,020
Yeah.

335
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,020
No, not 18.

336
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,020
I thought that would happen.

337
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,020
No, three days after.

338
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,020
Yeah, sorry.

339
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,020
Or maybe 20 November, around that.

340
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:53,700
assuming my package gets in the States by, no it can't because the 18th, Friday, yeah,

341
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:57,620
you know, I, remembering back to how things process when they ship from Japan, actually

342
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,420
it's going to kind of suck because I'll have to wait more days.

343
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:05,900
You have the science down to a T. Yeah, if it, my ship will ship on any given

344
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:11,880
damn day, as long as the package gets into the States by Friday, it will ship on a weekend

345
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,140
or a holiday. If not, it like flies around in circles over

346
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:18,380
Hawaii or something for the weekend and then it gets on San Francisco on Monday and then

347
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:24,620
it gets processed and whatever but yeah okay so that's my week and then today today was

348
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:33,940
alright I slept in forever tried playing some 2DX again today and I was having I was having

349
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:39,680
timing problems when going back to old styles got pissed off went back to play sixth again

350
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:44,120
and then somehow double-wayed Rotel to Sun, and I'm like, what the hell?

351
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,120
And so yeah.

352
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,120
My gods, he got skills!

353
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,120
Oh my god!

354
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:52,400
But yeah, you know, but no, I was having cravings to play Dune, and I barely passed Dune.

355
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:56,840
I was like, I don't remember this being 78 BPMs.

356
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,440
Do you need to upload those scores to VJ Army?

357
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,440
No.

358
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,640
Hey, I'm proud of myself.

359
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,640
Oh my god.

360
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,640
Those are good scores.

361
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,200
I'm just jealous because I haven't touched my 2DX controller or anything.

362
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:12,200
Don't worry, I'm not going to be bragging on here or anything. That was what I did today.

363
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,200
I sucked at everything else today.

364
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,200
So yeah, I'm ten.

365
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,200
I have to ask something. I actually played seventh style last week.

366
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,200
Did you?

367
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,200
Yay!

368
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,200
So I did do something with the money related.

369
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,200
Well, there you go!

370
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,200
Am I so happy a pop of nine arrived?

371
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,200
Oh, right on.

372
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,200
I haven't played it yet, but I have it.

373
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,200
Pop of nine won.

374
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,200
Oh, you know what? You don't have enough time to unlock everything before ten comes out.

375
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,200
The gambler's easy, bitch.

376
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,180
I don't even know that I'm going to get ten, I just...

377
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:43,340
Well, it'll take a very, very, very, very long time.

378
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:46,940
That's quite alright, I don't have a lot of time to play.

379
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:52,340
Maybe if we find what, you know, where you have to be in the game to let it sit in its place

380
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:57,300
so the timer will run and count, find that and let it sit on for like, you know, a day.

381
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,040
I like to play the little RPG mode.

382
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:02,000
You open the chest, you have X song unlocked.

383
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,840
That's kind of cool.

384
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:07,840
But seriously, it probably took, like, it took, I don't know, whatever, never mind. Okay.

385
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:14,840
Alright, well then we'll move on. Let's go on to Arkadian42. How was your week? How was your day? How was your Halloween?

386
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:23,840
For Halloween, I didn't do jack shit. I think I watched, like, Dark City the night before, but I didn't do anything on Halloween.

387
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:31,840
Next morning I got some candy, but unlike last year, they didn't do the big sale, because it was like Monday instead of, like, a weekend.

388
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:36,840
Either that or Safeway learned their lesson about people coming in the next day and buying things for like 50 cents.

389
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,840
Said they just did it for half price, so I bought some stuff.

390
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:48,840
Shared it with work and then worked all week and didn't do much this weekend other than straighten up a little bit and then catch up on message boards.

391
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:59,840
Then today went to the store and then went to the arcade for a little bit and played one game of Drummania and the symbol was broken.

392
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,920
and one game of Guitar Freaks and that was working alright

393
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:08,320
and that's all. It's good to know there's still some people in town that actually played

394
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:08,760
Bomani

395
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:13,560
It's good to know. Also I wanted to say, because you mentioned the day before Halloween, I just wanted to say

396
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,560
happy late birthday to Navi

397
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:18,920
and Mel B who both have the same birthday

398
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:22,720
if you can believe that. Wow. Day before Halloween. Woo.

399
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:27,000
I'm trying to figure out who's older

400
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:33,680
Alright, I guess I'll talk about my weekend my day my Halloween actually my Halloween was kind of stupid because I was having relationship issues

401
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:37,920
So I didn't really have much of a Halloween. I had a talking to on Halloween

402
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:41,760
There were no treats on Halloween just and they're really not even a trick either

403
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,680
Food yes, there was good food and

404
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:52,260
Because we had gone to spaghetti factor. I went I went and celebrated cheat day even though every day is cheat day for me

405
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:57,620
And we got to make fun of the guys in Walgreens. Yeah, that was cool. We made fun of the guys

406
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:00,020
in Walgreens who were like, I don't know what they were doing. They were hitting on you

407
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:04,220
or something? I think they were drunk. They were drunk. They were very drunk. But so as

408
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:07,980
you may have picked up, a lot of folks in the room here, when we're not doing DDR, we're

409
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:13,060
doing Rocky Horror, so I was involved with all that too. Quite involved with all that.

410
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:19,460
I hope you don't see the pictures. A lot of girls making threats over there. Hey, I got

411
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:26,900
pictures of you too, don't push me.

412
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:31,680
So that was Halloween the day before, and this last week was pretty boring, I got back

413
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:37,480
into playing Final Fantasy XI, which you know, addict right, I play that quite a bit.

414
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:41,480
Oh yeah, that was my cue, addict.

415
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:46,960
And gosh, not a whole lot else going on really, I was watching Loki play Grand Theft Auto

416
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:51,080
almost a week. I saw The Incredibles last night, which was a cute movie. It was pretty

417
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:55,440
good. A lot of people are saying it's going to be Oscar. Maybe, I don't know. I like to

418
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,300
kill Bill Vol. 2 a little better, but you know, I just like violence. So that was pretty

419
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:06,320
much my week. I decided on Saturday, this would be yesterday, that I want to be just

420
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:11,800
like Tanya, and I'm going to start the DDR diet. So I have to modify my diet a little

421
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:16,540
bit, because part of my diet is that I want abs, so I'm now doing the DDR-S diet, which

422
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:21,900
is DDR and sit-ups. So we'll see how that works out. I'll keep you posted on my progress,

423
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:26,940
but I found that I'm actually playing Max 2 a lot for DDR, even, because nobody's on

424
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:30,440
UltraMix, like a couple months ago I was playing UltraMix and there would be, you know, sometimes

425
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:33,820
people on, but I've been kind of pissed off lately because whenever I sign on to UltraMix,

426
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:38,420
all the games on there are like 8 and 9 footer songs, which is cool and all, and you know,

427
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:41,820
I can play those once in a while, but I don't like playing them back to back to back for

428
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:47,500
hour and it really stinks when you're playing against people on a controller so

429
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:51,180
I'll have to wait for Ultramix 2 to come out so that Xbox Live kind of gets a

430
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:53,940
swift kick in the ass and you know that gets jump-started again I'll have people

431
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:57,940
playing it but for the meantime it's all about the mega dance hits non-stop in

432
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:01,860
Max 2 which has you know my Kylie and Ghost and all that stuff so a lot of fun

433
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:06,540
and then of course sit-ups I threw my back out yesterday doing it though

434
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:13,820
cuz a hard lesson learned always stretch before you exercise always stretch how

435
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:17,980
could I be so stupid I don't know all right I guess you should hear from Loki

436
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:23,460
as well how was your week how was your day how was your Halloween my week was

437
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:30,140
alright didn't do much just what did I do this week I don't remember they get

438
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:36,860
something between Final Fantasy XI and Grand Theft Auto San Andreas. And, um, let's see

439
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:42,420
what else I did. Oh, we went on our first quote-unquote ghost hunt yesterday. We went

440
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:49,180
to Coloma for what seemed like hours, but actually it was only like about an hour. And,

441
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:58,180
um, it was stupid, actually, because, I don't know, it was, it was just walking around a

442
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:03,780
stupid cemetery and taking pictures of gravestones, and that was just like, eh, whatever, but

443
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:09,380
it kinda, just, we kinda got a dry run for the whole, um, ghost thingy thing. But anyways,

444
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:17,180
related to that, I finished the so-called gate to hell device thing, um, I was hoping

445
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:20,240
to bring it along with me yesterday, but we didn't have a recorder anyway, so that would

446
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:24,500
have not worked, so, how the fuck is that? But it's done, so that's one project out of

447
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:30,900
way and other than that I also saw the Incredibles and it was awesome and what

448
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:37,640
else did I do I don't know Oh Halloween since I was kind of forced to dress up

449
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:42,780
or I should say persuaded to dress up by my girlfriend I ended up dressing up

450
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:50,180
like Loki that day ironically left from Dogma so I had a nice coat and wings and

451
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:56,980
and that was kind of fun. And, I don't know, we just had a party and watched the new Dawn

452
00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:06,260
of the Dead and then Shaun of the Dead. So that was awesome. And that's all I did.

453
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:10,620
Loki, have you seen that preview for the brand new Mask sequel? You remember the Mask with

454
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:17,620
Jim Carrey? Oh my God, it looks so lame. But Alan Cumming, who is my God, he's so awesome,

455
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:20,540
he plays low-key

456
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:27,060
uh... uh...

457
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:30,780
uh... i guess we'll do now we're gonna go to another break and then we come back

458
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:34,380
uh... i want to make some big announcements we have a big announcement to make tonight

459
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:38,920
uh... regarding a giveaway a really really big giveaway that we're doing

460
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:42,340
you've heard us talking about it for a while and we even promised it would happen a couple

461
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,300
months ago but it didn't

462
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,080
but that's alright

463
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:47,560
because it really really is happening soon we actually have a date

464
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:50,440
We have the prizes in our possession, and if you don't know what we're talking about,

465
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:53,200
we're going to talk about it when we come back from this break, featuring more of the

466
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,200
UltraMix II V-Rare.

467
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:58,200
Also tonight, we're going to hear some stuff from 2DX Red at some point.

468
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:02,280
So in this break, a lot of you guys in the chat room were requesting to hear the Max

469
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:07,080
300 remix, so we're going to make that happen for you guys, as well as Gyruss, the new Gyruss

470
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,200
mix is awesome.

471
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:12,860
And then I know there's some fans of Day Behavior too, so we'll throw them in there as well.

472
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,620
So we will be back after this.

473
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:21,620
listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

474
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:16,620
Oh

475
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:43,620
I was picked up for a TV show

476
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:46,620
It's called A24

477
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:50,620
I am the girl that you all know

478
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:53,620
To love, hate, or adore

479
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:57,620
I've been waiting for my life

480
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:00,620
Just to be seen

481
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:03,620
Being by everyone

482
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:06,620
I wanted to be someone

483
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:10,620
I'm the student of a star

484
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:13,620
I'm longing to be seen

485
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,620
I'm back to you

486
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:20,620
I'll do anything

487
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:22,620
I'm here

488
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,620
I'm better than a star

489
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:44,620
Longing to be seen

490
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,120
I'm better than a girl

491
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:59,120
I'm jumping free, like a superstar, wanting everything

492
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:08,120
I'll never give up, I'll do anything you need

493
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:58,920

is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

495
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:08,920
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

496
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,920
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

497
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:14,920
We are live here on this lovely Sunday evening, as we are every Sunday night.

498
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:17,920
This is a big week for those of you guys that are Xbox fans.

499
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:21,920
I know a lot of you guys have Xbox. Huge game coming out Tuesday.

500
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,920
Biggest release. I know you've been waiting for it all year long.

501
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:32,480
karaoke revolutions coming out for Xbox on Tuesday I know you can't wait for it

502
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,140
so I know and I hear that folks are gonna be lining up around the corner at

503
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:40,600
midnight to buy this game so it's pretty crazy but just you know don't riot

504
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:44,920
please let's say orderly there's enough karaoke revolution for everyone I hear

505
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:48,560
that they expect that there could be extra copies on the shelves just a

506
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:55,560
couple no but seriously karaoke revolution what the hell it came out of

507
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:59,680
nowhere like I know we were talking about karaoke revolution Xbox a couple

508
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:03,560
weeks ago on the show and then suddenly I remember iguana girl made a post in

509
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:06,000
her live journal she was actually talking about karaoke revolution volume

510
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,580
three yeah because you know a go on a girl and I have been known to do some

511
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:14,800
karaoke and one of the songs that's being featured happens to be something

512
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:19,320
that both Sky and I used to do on a semi-regular basis.

513
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:22,600
Back when we actually spoke.

514
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:29,800
And for those that are really interested, there is a file on the Internet that you can

515
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:38,280
find somewhere at a particular convention that a particular Sky and I went to.

516
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,840
Actually that was when we first played DDR.

517
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:42,280
That was the same weekend that we first played DDR.

518
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:45,920
So if you want to see what I look like the first time I play DDR with this hideous zit

519
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:46,920
right on my nose.

520
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:47,920
The hideous face!

521
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:48,920
The hideous face!

522
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:51,920
Oh my god, the face!

523
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:58,600
But yeah, if you're, if you're, uh, coos enough to be able to find it, then, you know, that

524
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,680
file is still out there on the internet as far as I know.

525
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:04,160
Just think about what, now, Pop Quiz, you guys, think about what Iguana Girl and I talked

526
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,680
about during the last little banter session, okay?

527
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,320
So you might be able to find it.

528
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,320
Yeah.

529
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:16,680
Alright, so anyway, iguanagirl posted kref3, pointed out the fact that there was love shack.

530
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:21,180
And I knew, I had heard the karaoke revolution 3 had duets, and I even remember looking at

531
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:24,940
an early song list, but I just kind of skimmed it because there were so many songs, I don't

532
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:28,260
even remember connecting it, oh my god, love shack was in it, because maybe at the time

533
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:34,160
I didn't care either, I don't know, but, oh my god, that love shack crap, oh I don't want

534
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:46,160
I was surprised that the website didn't have a date, so I was like, okay, I'm going to

535
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,800
go find a date for when this game comes out.

536
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:52,680
I go to GameFacts.com, because Go On A Girl said, well, you spent your majority of E3

537
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:53,680
this year.

538
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,240
In the Karaoke Revolution 2 booth.

539
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:56,240
Yes, exactly.

540
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:59,680
Because, you know, they had a nice little seat, and it was air conditioned, and I liked

541
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:00,680
to sing.

542
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:01,680
They had the little Logitech microphones.

543
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:02,680
It was fun.

544
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:08,880
So it was assumed that, okay, well we'll get to try this out next May, but I was kind of

545
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:13,680
going, I don't know, it just seems like, you know, to put out the song, six months to wait

546
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:14,680
for that, I don't know.

547
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:18,160
So I decided to look for a street date, and sure enough, gamefacts.com, I bring it up,

548
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,320
says 11-9, the street date.

549
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,160
I'm like, is Xbox coming out the same day?

550
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:26,580
Sure enough, Karaoke Revolution Xbox, 11-9, a date you guys might have heard of for certain

551
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:28,640
releases of certain games.

552
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,280
Yes.

553
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:32,200
So I have no idea where the hell this is coming from.

554
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:36,440
Do you have any idea, Mel? I know you have some of the inside scoop at Konami, but do

555
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:39,400
you have any idea how the hell this just blindsided us all?

556
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:45,640
I think what it all boils down to is it just makes marketing sense. I mean, KR1 did really

557
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:50,040
well, KR2, you know, followed up pretty nicely, and hey, it's holiday season. Why not milk

558
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:53,000
the product for what it's worth, really? I think that's what it boils down to.

559
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,560
Well, I don't think it's any surprise that we're getting a Karaoke Revolution 3 and Duet's

560
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:02,280
logical next step in the right direction, but that was fast.

561
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:06,880
It's really wasn't that hard to, you know, I mean, one and two were pretty much not that

562
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:12,600
different, you know, aside from just one extra in the mode. And it's pretty safe to say after

563
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:17,000
they did like KR1, they had already been working on KR3 because it's really just kind of like

564
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,120
drop this in and, you know, it's, you just kind of add on top as opposed to redoing a

565
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:24,760
whole new engine. Yeah, I mean, it pretty much looks the same,

566
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:28,760
but now you got duets which is kind of cool so now you guys all out there in

567
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:33,880
Radio Land will have to find a friend to play this game with and just please go

568
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:39,400
out and find a friend please no please just in fact just for the sake of having

569
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:43,420
a life go for not kidding um but this is good because now I want a girl and I can

570
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:47,540
practice for you know because you know someday at our favorite bar they have to

571
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:52,920
do a duets contest someday it's got to happen we need to talk to our favorite

572
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:58,240
KJ about making that happen. So we've got to win that. So we can spend the money on

573
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:04,600
games. Because I'm going to be fucking broke after November, I don't know about you guys.

574
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:07,400
Quick poll, going around the room. Games you're looking forward to by the end of the year?

575
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:10,040
It doesn't have to be Bobbani, just any games you're looking forward to by the end of the

576
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:15,440
year? Oh man, there's still more stuff out there. I don't know, it's kind of hard to

577
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:18,960
say. Well obviously, yeah, you know, the 8 styles is definitely the one I'm looking forward

578
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:24,960
And I'm still looking forward to Rumble Roses. That's going to be pretty dope.

579
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,960
Yeah, that does come out Tuesday awesome.

580
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:31,960
It seems like most of the games I'm looking forward to have already come out.

581
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:34,960
And it's like, you know what, I need to look forward to more, man.

582
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,960
I'm still catching up on like three or four more games.

583
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,960
You know, it's like maybe by March, you know, I'll be caught up.

584
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:45,960
And then by that time E3 rolls around and it's like, great, more anticipation, you know, in May and so on and so on.

585
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:58,960
But I figured they're just kind of blowing everything out now, because once next-gen systems come out, you know, obviously, those first launch titles usually kind of blow ass, and, you know, but, uh, yeah, I think Roam of Roses right now is definitely high on my list.

586
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,960
Sounds good. Sharkskull, anything you're looking forward to?

587
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:09,960
Right now, it's mostly, like, UltraMix 2 and, um, 8th Style, because I've got all this stuff. I just got Donkey Konga a month or two ago.

588
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:10,960
Ooh, how was that?

589
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:11,960
Oh, I love that game.

590
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:16,720
love that game. We didn't get a chance to pick it up for the show here. That Tycho we completely missed. I am so freaking addicted to it.

591
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:21,000
I just sit there and just bop away. My mom's like, what the hell are you doing? I'm like, I'm playing Conga, leave me alone.

592
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,720
Um, and my friend from Nashville, Cincinnati, everywhere just came back and

593
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:28,320
he's got it too, so I found someone I could play with.

594
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:32,080
I might have to buy this too before the next time I visit. It's fun. We'll drive your mom

595
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:37,360
crazy. It's a lot of fun, but um, yeah, you know, I got that. I just got Burnout 3, I got

596
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:38,760
Star Wars Battlefront,

597
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:43,760
I got Katamari Damacy, I'm just catching up to everything I've just bought recently, and Dr. Mario.

598
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:48,760
The freaking crack game from way back.

599
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:53,760
So yeah, I'm just catching up to what I already bought. For the most part.

600
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:54,760
Sounds good.

601
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,760
Uh, Islander, what are you looking forward to?

602
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:59,760
Uh, like Mel, I'm looking forward to Rumble Roses.

603
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:05,760
Um, pretty much everything that I'm looking forward to is already, has already been released.

604
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:15,760
There's a lot of things I still need to pick up. Probably like, for example, MK Deception. I still want to pick up just for MK1.

605
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:20,760
You have to get the collector's edition for MK1 though, just so you know. Because I bought Deception, but it doesn't have MK1 on it.

606
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:29,760
Yeah, okay. So yeah, I know about that. Other than that, there's a few others, but recently we just picked up, you know, of course we have Extreme, Katamari Damacy,

607
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:36,600
Mad 2005 for me, and Smackdown Reservoir for myself, and between those four games, I mean,

608
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:41,720
there's still stuff on Extreme that I haven't unlocked yet. I mean, because I've got so

609
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:46,000
much stuff to play, so most of the stuff I've been looking for has already been released,

610
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,120
so I just need to, you know, just kind of save up for them.

611
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:53,680
Right on. Iguana Girl, what are you looking forward to?

612
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:58,400
Well, I would officially like to start the Iguana Girl Really Needs New Games Fund, because

613
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:02,120
I am too damn broke to be able to afford anything.

614
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:06,520
I would really, really love to be able to get A-Style, but first I'd love to get 7-Style,

615
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:07,520
a new controller.

616
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:08,520
I hear you.

617
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:13,360
It's kind of helpful to have a controller that functions.

618
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:17,340
Do you have a PayPal you want to plug?

619
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:19,440
If I could remember the name, I would.

620
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:26,340
But yeah, I'm incredibly broke in trying to make ends meet, but almost out of debt type

621
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:27,340
of deal.

622
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:32,860
So yeah, I would love to get 8 style, I would love to get 7 style still, and I would love

623
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:37,020
to get an Xbox to be able to play the Xbox versions of games.

624
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:41,780
And also, of course, you know, because I'm a karaoke horror, karaoke revolution 3.

625
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:42,780
Very cool.

626
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:43,780
Navi.

627
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:46,720
And I bet you not a single one of his games are going to be domestic.

628
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:47,720
Actually yeah.

629
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:54,340
Well, I mean, as far as ones that have yet to be released, I still want to play Deception

630
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:58,940
and San Andreas, but just haven't really gotten around to it.

631
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:05,980
I am so looking forward to getting my Ellie's for 8th Style and Pop and Music 10.

632
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:10,900
As far as the future, I'm thinking about picking up the new Taeko no Tatsujin game.

633
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:13,100
It's actually the song list I saw.

634
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:16,940
There's like random ass licensed songs in there that I know.

635
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:19,820
All these like, you know, Karaoke Revolution and all these other games that incorporate

636
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:24,780
any music in it they're all crossing over with each other like like choo-choo train

637
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:33,580
is in it and stuff um and any interest in the u.s version at all probably not i don't

638
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:40,120
know i haven't i haven't checked out any song listings for that yet though um but god what

639
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:46,260
else was there supposedly the sequel to karatemanidamashi is still supposed to be out before the year's

640
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:56,820
over. The Japanese one came out like in February. They haven't given a release date on it, they're

641
00:51:56,820 --> 00:52:00,040
being all super secretive on it, but I think it still says it's supposed to be out before

642
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:05,300
the end of the year. And then I think I'm going to go get one of those Dragon Warrior

643
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:09,480
slime controllers. Those are so cute. What site can they go to

644
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:12,940
to check those out? Actually, they're now up for pre-order. I

645
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:19,940
I just checked last night. They're up for pre-orders at NCSX and Japan Video Games and they're $45.

646
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:22,940
Arkadian.

647
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:26,940
I think the only thing I'd be anticipating would be 8th style.

648
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:31,940
There's so many songs I like in that style.

649
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:34,940
Even though I haven't played 7th style in months.

650
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:38,940
Mainly because I do typing and stuff all day.

651
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:45,780
kinda hard to do more stuff with my hands. Nothing really else because I hardly follow

652
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:46,780
games anymore.

653
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:49,660
Aww, well that's alright.

654
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:55,540
With like all old systems and only Japanese PS2 and that's pretty much it.

655
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:59,660
I haven't touched my Japanese PS2 in months. It feels so neglected it's crying in my room

656
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:01,180
under the pile of laundry it's under.

657
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:03,860
Let's go nuzzle it.

658
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:07,540
I need to cuddle with it tonight and let it know I still love it. I just, you know, have

659
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:14,540
no use for it. There's some rejection. Poor thing's going to go crying off to the Xbox

660
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:22,140
now. Oh my god, my JPS2 is going to elope with my GameCube. Ever since Josh and I stopped

661
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:28,020
playing Four Swords, I haven't touched the GameCube either. They're going to elope. They

662
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:35,020
do get the GS2. Dark Sacra, what are you looking forward to this holiday? Definitely Ape Style,

663
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:41,020
8th style, which I actually have to go and play Asia and make my pre-order.

664
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:46,320
Actually, I know for sure I'm getting the Taiko no Tatujin US one, because Dan basically

665
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:50,220
slipped and told me he's getting it for me. Although he made an interesting slip, something

666
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:53,540
about an arcade-style controller, but for 2DX.

667
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:54,540
Ooh!

668
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:58,260
Because we were talking about expensive presents, and that's what...

669
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:01,300
Jamie's favorite kind, for those listening, by the way.

670
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:03,900
Yeah, it doesn't matter what it is you're shopping for.

671
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:08,900
I don't really think I'm going to get it, but I was talking about a $400 set of

672
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:13,900
Copic Markers that I wanted. They had it at A1 Comics and I was like, I really want

673
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:17,900
this, but I would rather have a tablet because I wanted a nice big art tablet.

674
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:21,900
He was like, well, you could get that or you could get an arcade style controller,

675
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:25,900
and then he didn't say anything else. So I was like, ooh.

676
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:30,900
Very interesting. Very. Although, honestly, I want to try actually building one.

677
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:35,740
Yeah, and I haven't seen any place now that has 2DX arcade-style controllers for anything

678
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:36,740
less than $500 now.

679
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:38,660
Wasn't there a third-party that was making one, though?

680
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:39,660
Huh?

681
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:40,660
Wasn't there a third-party that was getting one?

682
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:41,660
I don't know about that.

683
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:44,900
There's tons of third-parties for pop and music arcade-style controllers, and they're

684
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:48,980
only like $250, but yeah, they've gone up like $150 since I got mine.

685
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:52,060
So I could just make one.

686
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:58,460
I found all the schematics to make one myself, so I could do it if I had time.

687
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:04,960
But as far as any other game, I definitely want Katamari Damacy 2.

688
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:08,960
I'm sort of in about DDR right now, just because I'm so busy with everything else, I don't

689
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,700
really have time to play.

690
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:15,920
I was actually thinking about getting the DDR aerobics game, though.

691
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:16,920
Cute.

692
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:18,720
What was it?

693
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:21,720
I remember it was Aerobic Revolution or something, yeah.

694
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:23,800
I was thinking about it.

695
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:26,000
We heard it was coming out, and then we didn't hear anything else.

696
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,180
The game I want, though, it's already came out in the US, but it's really crappy.

697
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:32,460
So I need to import Bujingai.

698
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:35,180
It's the game with Gakda as the main character.

699
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:39,240
Now somebody had sent me a link about this, that Gakda was doing a voice, I think Dark

700
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:40,240
Knight was telling me about this.

701
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:41,240
He's the whole character model.

702
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:42,240
That's awesome.

703
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:47,800
The game, it was, in fact I put pictures in my live journal way back when, you know, when

704
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:52,880
they were actually in production of the game, but it just looked really, really awesome

705
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:56,520
and I heard that they really, really butchered it for the U.S., but now the import's gonna

706
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,760
be cheap since the U.S. version is out.

707
00:55:58,760 --> 00:55:59,760
Oh, okay.

708
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:02,720
A lot of the importers should have it really cheap, but I have to go around, jumping around

709
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:05,320
from, you know, building to building is gawked.

710
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:06,320
Gawk didn't have to...

711
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:07,320
And all this fabulousness.

712
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:09,200
He didn't have to speak in English for the English one, did he?

713
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,760
No, they probably got somebody else.

714
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:11,760
I don't...

715
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:12,760
Ooh, that'd be weird.

716
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:13,760
I know.

717
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:16,080
I was like, I can't hear another voice with that.

718
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:19,880
I have to have his, you know, voice.

719
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:20,880
It just doesn't...

720
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:21,880
I wouldn't be right.

721
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:23,880
All right, anything else?

722
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:26,880
Um, hopefully a game where I can shoot things.

723
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,880
Right on.

724
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:33,880
Um, as far as my top three games for this holiday season, I would say number three is

725
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:38,880
a tie, um, 2DXA style I gotta get. I know it's gonna get me back into 2DX, which I'm

726
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:43,880
sure makes Navi, yeah, he's grinning over there, cause he missed, I guess I suck now

727
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:46,880
and it used to be like Navi and I would have little friendly competitions about, you know,

728
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,880
who can beat this song first, and then at one point I just said, ah, fuck it, you beat

729
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:53,600
you know, and I just kind of quit 2DX, but I think 8 style might get me back into it

730
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:59,500
a little bit, but it's kind of a tie because Rumble Roses, I really want it, and this is

731
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:03,080
strange because, and this is no secret to those of you who listen to the show, I'm a

732
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:09,020
gay guy, but... Since when did you turn straight? I, I, you know what, it's hilarious, I mean

733
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:14,520
the thought of women kicking the shit out of each other in mud wrestling, to Bamani

734
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:19,360
music stuff, type stuff, because the artists are doing it, it's hilarious to me. Well,

735
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:23,360
I mean, jeez, I'm a straight chick, and I love playing DOA, Extreme Beach Volleyball,

736
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:25,860
and putting them in the tiniest little freaking bikinis I could find.

737
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:26,560
Exactly.

738
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:27,360
I do it all the time.

739
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:30,960
There's something about being able to, uh, kick the shit out of, you know,

740
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:34,560
or become a woman that can kick the shit out of everybody, it's...

741
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:35,560
I don't know.

742
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:39,060
No, and I'm not one of those, like, transsexual whatevers, okay?

743
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:40,960
I just... think it's fun.

744
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:45,460
Then after they've slowly beat each other to, um, submission in the mud,

745
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:52,460
They slowly strip off the clothes and go at it in a very aggressive, sexual, uh, yeah.

746
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:54,460
Rob is out without power.

747
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:55,460
I need a towel.

748
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:58,460
No, um, go power!

749
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:07,460
Before we get too far away from it, the third party, um, controllers I was thinking about for 2DX would be Controlica, which is a new site that's actually come out.

750
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:12,220
They're going to be selling supposedly in the winter 2DX arcade style controllers that

751
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:18,060
are supposed to be on par or if not better for $375 plus shipping and based on their

752
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:21,980
pop music controller which looks just like an arcade style controller, all metal, really

753
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:22,980
nice.

754
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:24,780
It should be pretty good.

755
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:25,780
Very nice.

756
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:26,780
All right.

757
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:28,100
Thank you for interrupting me.

758
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:29,100
That's all right.

759
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:30,100
It's good to know.

760
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:32,900
I was wondering what that site was because you're showing it to me earlier this week.

761
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:33,900
I forgot.

762
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:39,180
As far as my number two, and try not to boo me for this, but I really do want this game.

763
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:42,820
I haven't even said what it is yet.

764
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:44,580
I want Halo 2 really bad.

765
00:58:44,580 --> 00:58:46,580
Me too, oh my god, me too.

766
00:58:46,580 --> 00:58:49,500
And we can play online and I can run over you with the Warthog.

767
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:53,260
Well this is the thing, okay, you guys have to understand, that back when I was in college,

768
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:56,060
my buddies at Sonoma State, I had a bunch of friends that went to Sonoma State over

769
00:58:56,060 --> 00:58:59,540
in the Bay, and they all had a really fast internet connection, so they would set up

770
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:03,060
Quake servers, and I used to get on there and school them at Quake.

771
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:05,660
I was really good don't don't listen to him. I was the best at quake

772
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:05,960
Okay

773
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:11,940
And so now the halo twos out and it's on Xbox live like everybody that was in college that little circle friends in college

774
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:17,240
They have an Xbox. They're all getting Xbox live. So it's like we're gonna relive the old days through halo 2. It's so precious

775
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:22,580
So yeah, I really really want halo 2 so shut up. Don't hate. Why do you suck now shut

776
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:26,120
Cuz he's gay, duh

777
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:29,860
Now I remember why we haven't had you on the show any here

778
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:36,760
I'm just kidding. And then my number one, absolutely DDR Ultramix 2. I believe it's

779
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:40,180
going to live up to the hype. I think it's going to be awesome. I have no doubt it's

780
00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:46,360
going to be a Bomani fan's wet dream this winter, so I'm looking forward to it, definitely.

781
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:49,480
And I'm also looking forward to being able to play, and Seagurd has already accepted

782
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:54,560
this challenge, I'm going to play Seagurd on this show, live, and beat him at his own

783
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:59,320
own steps. That's the challenge that's on the table right now. Are you listening? You

784
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:07,440
listening? It's own. It's already been brought in. All right. Okay, was that everybody? Loki,

785
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:14,960
I didn't get your top three. What are you looking forward to this holiday season? Gimme.

786
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:21,600
I don't know if this is coming out within this time frame, but Alien Hominid. I don't

787
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:26,680
though. I don't pay attention to this shit. God. So that one looked really awesome.

788
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:30,360
Dude, did I tell you about that last time I was here, though?

789
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:33,240
Nope. Oh, yeah, you mentioned it, but then wasn't

790
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:38,280
it like your friend or something? Yeah, my friend James, his friend is the

791
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:40,280
one who designed it. Looks awesome.

792
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:46,040
Yes. So that one would be cool. Oh, gosh. Really,

793
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:50,960
as far as video games, I'm not looking forward to anything, to be honest. Really, E3, I was

794
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:56,520
just kind of eh, you know, so no, there's not really anything I'm looking forward to

795
01:00:56,520 --> 01:01:04,440
at all. No, I can't think of anything. Unless, well, well.

796
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:08,880
You know what? You got Grand Theft Auto San Andreas and you can beat cops senseless with

797
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:11,520
your pimp cane. I don't know if there's anything else that really you need.

798
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:16,960
They could always have a Driver 4 so that I could see even worse AI.

799
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:20,320
Wow. Oh my God, that game sucks.

800
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:24,320
I just, the only reason I play is just to see how bad it sucks.

801
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:30,320
And, you know, it's, it's great. And it's funny though, because in Grand Theft Auto San Andreas,

802
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:36,320
there's a point in the game where you have to go into this rapper's house and like steal like his rhyme book,

803
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:42,320
and he's playing Driver 3 and seeing how bad it sucks when you walk by him. It's great.

804
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:48,320
But anyways, um, no, really, um, oh yeah, the other thing I'm really looking forward to,

805
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:53,320
And hopefully they'll get it out by, you know, winter, you know, 2004. It's in the groove, the home version.

806
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:58,320
Dot, dot, dot.

807
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:04,320
No, actually, I don't care. But, um, I would like to see, um, Pump It Up exceed.

808
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:05,320
Yeah.

809
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:06,320
I would like to see that.

810
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:07,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it looks interesting.

811
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:12,320
You know, I don't play Pump It Up and I despise the arcade. I'd still like to see it because it'd be something different.

812
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:24,320
And, um... God, you know, um... I don't know, all the good games have already come out. Like, most of the Konami ones are already out, so...

813
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:34,320
Well, you know, I don't know, I can't think of any good ones. I guess Metal Gear Solid 3, but I don't like even playing Metal Gear Solid 3, or Solid or Solid 2, so...

814
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:40,320
I don't know. The DS, I guess? I don't know. That might be pretty cool.

815
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:46,320
So they can start re-releasing. Oh! A new Animal Crossing game, if that ever comes out.

816
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:49,320
Animal Crossing DS would be cool.

817
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:53,320
You know, these are those times when I'm very grateful that my man works where he does.

818
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:55,320
So I can get my free DS.

819
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:59,320
Absolutely. Hey, have you gotten a copy of the Ultramix 2V Rare through them yet?

820
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:01,320
He's got it. He just hasn't brought it home for me yet.

821
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:06,620
Hmm, interesting. I know those are hitting the shelves, so if you haven't found yours yet, go- go bug your local GameStop.

822
01:03:07,820 --> 01:03:11,920
It's great. It's a great CD. I mean, even if it wasn't even DDR-related, it's still a great CD.

823
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:18,620
And I think it is just awesome that for the first time we have full-length versions of songs that weren't done by Konami. That's pretty cool.

824
01:03:18,620 --> 01:03:22,220
I mean, not that Konami songs are bad, don't get me wrong, but it's just neat to have other stuff on there, so...

825
01:03:22,420 --> 01:03:23,420
Check it out if you haven't yet.

826
01:03:23,420 --> 01:03:29,140
Konami bringing on a different drum is probably the smartest thing they could have done for

827
01:03:29,140 --> 01:03:34,180
both a different drum and themselves. Definitely. Yeah, I don't know if you guys noticed this,

828
01:03:34,180 --> 01:03:39,740
but, and this is out in the UltraMix 2 thread over on The Freak right now, so there's no

829
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:46,000
secret, but that Alien C16, whatever the guy's name, his website says that he has certain

830
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:50,340
songs that were in UltraMix 2. TOY, if you go to his site, his site says there are certain

831
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:55,360
songs in Ultramix 2. If you just thought to go to a different drums website and look at

832
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:58,980
all the links to the artist pages, if you were really bored, you would have known about

833
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:05,300
that stuff months ago. But, c'est la vie. It was a fun secret while it lasted, I guess.

834
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:13,300
Who knows? Anyway, let's see. Well, okay, I want to talk about some things that are

835
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:16,900
going to be coming up on the station. Obviously, I teased this. We've got a contest that's

836
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:21,380
going to be coming up and Floatwalk, you were a big part of helping hook us up with this.

837
01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:23,640
I'm actually going to, if you don't mind, Dark Seqra, I'm going to bring up the cam

838
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:26,740
for a minute because I want to put these on the cam real fast, but let us know about it.

839
01:04:26,740 --> 01:04:29,980
We talked about it on the station a little bit before, but remind us again, Floatwalk,

840
01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:32,380
what are we doing with our buddies at DDR Spot right now?

841
01:04:32,380 --> 01:04:38,100
Well, DDR Spot, for those who actually come visit us once in a while, we'll reward you

842
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:44,000
because roughly around next week or so, we're going to relaunch basically another version

843
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:49,880
And obviously it's gonna be more or less coinciding with UltraMix 2 coming out and such, but Orange

844
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:54,760
Lounge is doing a giveaway, as are we, and we're doing the same gifts actually, which

845
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:56,720
I have brought up finally.

846
01:04:56,720 --> 01:05:01,400
As you know, of course me being the man and all that kind of stuff, I got my hookups here

847
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:08,280
and there, and those in Orange Lounge, I know a bunch of y'all are Kira Yamaoka fans, so

848
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:15,160
We got four of his promotional CDs, which are actually like little mini CDs, which have,

849
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:20,720
I believe one of them is the, what's that song, Room of Angel I guess it is, yeah, it

850
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:23,600
has that and then it has like a spoken track on it afterwards.

851
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:31,320
It was kind of a promotional giveaway in Japan and he has autographed all four CDs, so those

852
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:41,240
who want to get a piece of the man, they are more than welcome to try. But let's see what

853
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:47,580
else is going on. Yeah, that's our big giveaway for the time being. There's probably more

854
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:50,300
we might have in the future, but be grateful for what you have.

855
01:05:50,300 --> 01:05:56,900
So this is the way the contest is going to work, boys and girls. We're going to start

856
01:05:56,900 --> 01:06:01,860
this contest on... I got to bring up the calendar because I forgot. It's not tomorrow, but a

857
01:06:01,860 --> 01:06:05,460
week from tomorrow. November 15th is when this contest is going to start. It's going

858
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:11,940
to run for two weeks. Here's the deal. Monday nights, Tuesday nights, and Thursday nights,

859
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:15,700
Orange Launch Radio have certain spin-off programs. You might have heard of these. Diversion

860
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:20,260
on Mondays, pump up the volume on Tuesday, and Outside the Box, moving to Thursday nights

861
01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:25,060
this week. So starting on the 15th, on each one of these shows, we're going to ask a trivia

862
01:06:25,060 --> 01:06:29,060
Something about a Kiryamoka, something about Silent Hill, won't be too difficult, but you

863
01:06:29,060 --> 01:06:31,460
know, my challenge, you might have to do a little research.

864
01:06:31,460 --> 01:06:33,940
We're going to ask you a question on each one of these shows.

865
01:06:33,940 --> 01:06:37,200
Then for each week, because we have two CDs, we're going to be doing this for two weeks,

866
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:40,940
at the end of each week we'll take all the emails with the correct answers and we'll

867
01:06:40,940 --> 01:06:46,300
be drawing one randomly and whoever gets all the answers correct and we pull them randomly

868
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:51,940
out of the hat, they win a signed Kiryamoka Silent Hill 4 limited edition CD.

869
01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:56,260
imported from Japan, worth a lot of money doing a Kiryamoka collector, you got to

870
01:06:56,260 --> 01:07:00,400
have this. So definitely be tuned in to those shows. I will post more information

871
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:03,220
on the website all about it in the coming weeks. So it's our first like

872
01:07:03,220 --> 01:07:07,140
really really big giveaway so I'm excited. So big thanks to Float Walk and

873
01:07:07,140 --> 01:07:10,460
DDR spot for helping us out with that. So stay tuned to the website and of course

874
01:07:10,460 --> 01:07:14,500
if you're not eligible for the Orange Lounge Radio one because I believe the

875
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:18,820
rule was if you've been to Orange Lounge Radio in person three times you're

876
01:07:18,820 --> 01:07:23,560
considered a regular and you're not eligible so but but a lot of you guys

877
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:28,500
would be eligible to win DDR spots and vice versa DDR spot staff could be

878
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:32,380
eligible for ours so something to think about all right so you got some

879
01:07:32,380 --> 01:07:35,980
competition out there that we all want the CDs I I would love to keep them I

880
01:07:35,980 --> 01:07:40,500
think we'll just close the station down tomorrow and I'll just keep them all

881
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:44,180
right no we're gonna be doing that if it's any consolation even I'm not

882
01:07:44,180 --> 01:07:51,060
keeping an autographed CD. These are all sharing to the people. Of course, I have my own autographs

883
01:07:51,060 --> 01:07:53,620
of his, but that's neither here nor there.

884
01:07:53,620 --> 01:08:00,080
Alright. Also, I got a big announcement. A lot of people in the room don't even know

885
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:04,940
this one yet, because we just got the okay on it, just a couple hours before you guys

886
01:08:04,940 --> 01:08:10,540
all got here. But next week, we're going to have an interview. Our very first Bamani artist

887
01:08:10,540 --> 01:08:12,440
is going to be on the show

888
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:16,260
conception from the are also makes two he did the song altitude he's gonna be

889
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:17,440
on the show next week

890
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:20,420
so check out how to be here live we're gonna talk to him over our brand new

891
01:08:20,420 --> 01:08:23,340
uh... skype out thing we've got we can call him

892
01:08:23,340 --> 01:08:24,620
already talking to him

893
01:08:24,620 --> 01:08:26,480
and we might have another one

894
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:29,440
in the next few weeks uh... we'll see i don't know i don't know if you want to

895
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:32,660
say they are not that

896
01:08:32,660 --> 01:08:33,980
we might also have

897
01:08:33,980 --> 01:08:37,740
the guy behind the most kick-ass remit in baumanni

898
01:08:37,740 --> 01:08:42,740
Looked at the, um, not looked at this guy. In my eyes, the Midihead remix, Midihead.

899
01:08:42,740 --> 01:08:47,740
We might have Midiheads, so we're working on that. We're working it.

900
01:08:47,740 --> 01:08:50,740
This could be the beginning of something beautiful.

901
01:08:50,740 --> 01:08:53,740
We'll see. Now I'm looking forward to asking Conceptual a lot of questions.

902
01:08:53,740 --> 01:08:54,740
How do you feel like real radio?

903
01:08:54,740 --> 01:08:56,740
I know, it's so weird.

904
01:08:56,740 --> 01:09:01,740
Pretty soon, you know, we'll outgrow this little apartment studio thing we got going.

905
01:09:01,740 --> 01:09:03,740
That means we can have a compound.

906
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:08,420
we might have to sell ads on the site because people might actually want to

907
01:09:08,420 --> 01:09:11,620
like get known out there anyway so that's definitely interesting we're

908
01:09:11,620 --> 01:09:16,340
going to ask conception a lot of questions about how he became hooked up

909
01:09:16,340 --> 01:09:20,700
with Ultramix 2 and what is music lag with songs about he's actually gonna

910
01:09:20,700 --> 01:09:23,660
send us a song too and I don't think a lot of guys have heard it yet so we're

911
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:30,020
gonna play that for you guys next week on the show so stay tuned for that let's

912
01:09:30,020 --> 01:09:36,300
Let's see. What should we do now? Are we going to go to break? Let's do a break. You guys

913
01:09:36,300 --> 01:09:37,300
want a break?

914
01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:38,300
We can break things.

915
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:40,820
Yeah, let's do a break. I think, how much longer are you guys going to be here?

916
01:09:40,820 --> 01:09:42,820
Another segment, I guess.

917
01:09:42,820 --> 01:09:49,860
Try another segment? Maybe another hour? Okay. Let's see if we can't do some good old-fashioned

918
01:09:49,860 --> 01:09:55,260
Bahmani match game tonight, okay? Here's how it's going to work, though. We're going to

919
01:09:55,260 --> 01:09:59,660
get a caller on Skype, and of course, what we do when we get somebody on Skype, they

920
01:09:59,660 --> 01:10:07,140
will get to challenge either Float Walk, Sharks Girl, Islander, or Iguana Girl, or Navi, or

921
01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:11,700
Arcadian 42, they can pick somebody to challenge on tonight's Bimani match game, so that should

922
01:10:11,700 --> 01:10:12,700
be a lot of fun.

923
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:13,700
You guys up for it?

924
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:14,700
Yeah!

925
01:10:14,700 --> 01:10:15,700
Alright.

926
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:16,700
Absolutely.

927
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:17,700
So we're going to do some Bimani match game tonight.

928
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:22,900
Also, right now, we're going to get to some stuff from 2DX Red, and to be honest, I've

929
01:10:22,900 --> 01:10:29,020
kind of fallen behind on 2DX Red, so I'm going to turn to our local moderator on Bimani style

930
01:10:29,020 --> 01:10:32,520
probably knows about more of what's going on with 2DX Red than I do.

931
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:36,020
Navi, what's up with 2DX Red? The game's out? Is that correct?

932
01:10:36,020 --> 01:10:41,020
It's out. It came out the day after the site went up.

933
01:10:41,020 --> 01:10:47,020
Well, the official, it was like the 27th or 28th of October. It went up.

934
01:10:47,020 --> 01:10:52,020
Yep. It's out. What else do you want? I've had a brain fart.

935
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:56,020
I bring the microphone to you. I stalk you. Tell the class about it.

936
01:10:56,020 --> 01:11:00,020
English, do you speak it?

937
01:11:00,020 --> 01:11:04,020
English. It's red. It's very red.

938
01:11:04,020 --> 01:11:08,020
Things about it. God, it's another 2DX mix.

939
01:11:08,020 --> 01:11:12,020
I don't really know what all that is to be said. You just need to listen to that music.

940
01:11:12,020 --> 01:11:16,020
Give me the fucking mic.

941
01:11:16,020 --> 01:11:20,020
I'm annoyed at the site right now, though, because there's no artwork for me to download

942
01:11:20,020 --> 01:11:24,020
to make my desktop wallpaper.

943
01:11:24,020 --> 01:11:28,020
I'll have you give me inspiration, Loki, then I'll take something intelligent for once.

944
01:11:54,020 --> 01:12:02,020
but that's also being added. Then we've got the addition of, what is it, 8 Plus Star?

945
01:12:02,020 --> 01:12:08,020
They've broken down the ratings into 1 through 8 and Flashing Eights. Flashing Eights now

946
01:12:08,020 --> 01:12:15,020
are just songs like A and Kakumei and stuff like that. There's been plenty of songs that

947
01:12:15,020 --> 01:12:18,020
have been upgraded, some that I thought were kind of weird upgrade, like Zero One's now

948
01:12:18,020 --> 01:12:27,500
an 8 and Linus is an 8 and a bunch of other crap. Most of the, a lot of old

949
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:31,700
artists, the regular artists, are not in it. They are off doing other

950
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:36,540
projects right now so they have revived a lot of old artists like like fourth

951
01:12:36,540 --> 01:12:42,620
style kind of stuff like Nova Nude or no no no that was a fake. That was a fake.

952
01:12:42,620 --> 01:12:51,980
There was no Super Highway? No, there was no voter asylum either. They revived Wall

953
01:12:51,980 --> 01:13:00,580
Five. I love their new song. If you see the new video for it, it's really cool. It's like

954
01:13:00,580 --> 01:13:10,060
a bunch of twitching animals to the song. Baby Weapon, DJ Swan from Fifth Style. There's

955
01:13:10,060 --> 01:13:14,400
There's actually a handful of artists that, you know, like, when the 2DX, um, when the

956
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:18,140
remix album for 10th Style came out were all, who the fuck are they? Well, now they have

957
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:23,780
their own songs in here. Um, DJ 19, DJ Tomo, I think DJ Yoshitaka was one of the ones that

958
01:13:23,780 --> 01:13:25,300
was on the 10th Style remix album also.

959
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:27,980
I'm glad to see Ryu doing something other than happy hardcore.

960
01:13:27,980 --> 01:13:30,820
Yeah, his new song isn't as great as they were in 10th Style.

961
01:13:30,820 --> 01:13:34,020
I like it. I forget what his song was, though, but it wasn't...

962
01:13:34,020 --> 01:13:35,020
It'd be quiet.

963
01:13:35,020 --> 01:13:37,700
Be quiet? I love that song! That's awesome!

964
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:39,800
of that uh...

965
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:43,900
god uh... ice can't understand what the fuck paul terry is saying

966
01:13:43,900 --> 01:13:45,580
and he sucks again

967
01:13:45,580 --> 01:13:47,040
she said

968
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:51,220
you know i'm sorry she's only good with uh... mom i'm i'm

969
01:13:51,220 --> 01:13:53,140
what's-her-name

970
01:13:53,140 --> 01:13:54,040
you

971
01:13:54,040 --> 01:13:57,820
any issues out of key as usual well you know it's really weird because like

972
01:13:57,820 --> 01:14:00,180
anything

973
01:14:00,180 --> 01:14:02,180
that one mix that you

974
01:14:02,180 --> 01:14:03,700
found no key

975
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:05,600
well no okay the only stuff i've heard of

976
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:07,160
paul terry's good with that

977
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:11,680
trans artist I found orbitribe that's that's it yeah yeah the only like I

978
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:15,600
don't know what it is maybe like I know maybe Naoki has like some well you know

979
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:19,520
now he sounds like real key like oh my god I think what do though fucking have

980
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:25,160
you heard have you heard red zone have you heard it if you know no it's how I'm

981
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:30,520
attached and Naoki and it sounds like some really old DDR song that's Naoki I

982
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:35,280
mean he needs to just go under another alias and just stay under that alias and

983
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:41,640
ever, ever, ever go back to Naoki again. Because, honestly, this, I mean, I, you know, I like

984
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:47,560
Yuru, no, I don't like Yuru Bean, I'm not gonna try to lie there. You know, stuff like

985
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:50,880
Be For You, Brilliant To You and stuff, that was good back then.

986
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:55,760
That's what Red Zone sounds like. Stop making the same damn song over and over

987
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:58,840
and telling it something different. I think it's really funny that Red Zone sounds

988
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:03,840
like that, but he's in collaboration with a new sound producer. Um, Slake is no longer

989
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:11,400
sound producer on this apparently he's got three songs in the mix already but

990
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:15,960
yeah I was like all the artists that are no longer with the mix this current mix

991
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:25,240
right now we will not be seeing mr. T tak show you to Rohrata huh god I'm

992
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:29,520
forgetting there's there was a ton of them that just that aren't in there at

993
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:35,080
least aren't in there yet. Now, was any of the artists that, what was it, from like,

994
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:41,880
I think it was, god, I think it was from like 9th Style, the ones that, was it the, I still

995
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:45,280
haven't seen any, the musicianship trials, are they back, you mean? I haven't seen any

996
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:52,120
of them, but they have new, there were people who won stuff from the new Bamani Vocal Audition

997
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:56,880
earlier this year. There's this new chick in there, I forget her name, but she has two

998
01:15:56,880 --> 01:16:04,400
songs with Naoki. One of them is Taio, and the other one is D-A-N-C-E.

999
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:10,240
Man, what the hell is up with a guy being in B4U? That's what I want to know.

1000
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:15,320
I mean, you gotta either feel sorry for him, or he's the luckiest bastard in the world.

1001
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:19,600
What are you talking about? There is a guy in the group B4U.

1002
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:23,640
There is not a guy in B4U. There is a guy. I swear to God it's a guy.

1003
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:25,640
You want me to point it out?

1004
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:27,640
Show me the guy!

1005
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:29,640
Show me the guy!

1006
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:31,640
I want to see this!

1007
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:37,640
There were five people that won the Bimani Vocal Audition.

1008
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:39,640
Three of them are now members of B4U.

1009
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:44,640
One of them was the chick that has the two songs from 2DX right now and another one is a guy.

1010
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:48,640
He has not had any songs that I know of yet.

1011
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:50,640
Where are you going?

1012
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:52,640
Yeah, okay.

1013
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:54,640
Doo doo doo doo doo.

1014
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:56,640
Wait, wait, wait.

1015
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:58,640
Wait, wait, wait.

1016
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:00,640
Doo doo doo doo.

1017
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:02,640
Okay.

1018
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:04,640

1029
01:17:35,220 --> 01:17:36,280

DJ Amaro we're also gonna hear B4U

1035
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:50,640
It's Key S.A. Key, I believe is the name of the song, by B4U,

1036
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:52,180
and the new Orange Lounge song.

1037
01:17:52,180 --> 01:17:54,520
And I'm going to try and say this is my French accent.

1038
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:57,480
Les fillets, bon accès.

1039
01:17:57,480 --> 01:17:59,160
Let me read it all day.

1040
01:17:59,160 --> 01:18:00,320
Yeah, Shark Scrolls is going to be gone.

1041
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:00,880
I know French.

1042
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:02,360
Let me read it.

1043
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:04,400
We'll try to get it over here after the break.

1044
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:05,900
OK, we're going to go to this break.

1045
01:18:05,900 --> 01:18:07,200
We will be right back.

1046
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:09,040
Have a good one.

1047
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:12,420
To be continued

1048
01:21:42,420 --> 01:21:44,920
I can't let you out, I can't let you see

1049
01:23:44,920 --> 01:24:08,360
For the best part of Orange Lab, this PDF sucks!

1050
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:09,360
Holla!

1051
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:10,360
Stop!

1052
01:24:10,360 --> 01:24:11,360
Stop!

1053
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:20,360
Hello, and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio. You know, we have several of those...

1054
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:21,360
Yay, Step Squad!

1055
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:22,360
We have several of those little...

1056
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:23,360
I love everyone!

1057
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:24,360
Step Squad!

1058
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:30,660
We have several little DDL factions in house. We have representation from RTF, we have representation

1059
01:24:30,660 --> 01:24:35,360
from Step Squad, and we have representation from the Nobodies. Thank you.

1060
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:44,080
Alright, shark skull, big fat nobodies, BFN for life, they're real!

1061
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:49,260
I'm representing Heaven's Gate, I just forgot to drink the Kool-Aid.

1062
01:24:49,260 --> 01:24:51,800
I think a new DDR squad has just been born.

1063
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:55,920
BFN, big fat nothing, is this our gang sign, what is this, why do we keep doing this, I

1064
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:56,920
don't know.

1065
01:24:56,920 --> 01:24:57,920
ETERGEO!

1066
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:10,920
Hey, Navi, want to be in BFN? Yeah! Yeah! Alright. Actually, BFN should be that. A big fat nothing.

1067
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:22,920
Okay. We'll be taking applications a little later. Alright. That's BFL. That's a little different.

1068
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:27,720
Of course, a few people said I was in the GFR squad, but I...

1069
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:34,920
Anyway, so, speaking of GFR, did you get this guy in B4U situation sorted out?

1070
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:41,920
Yes, yes, yes, it's not B4U, but he's just some ugly guy that's in a picture with B4U

1071
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:42,920
people, so.

1072
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:50,440
Anyways, there's this guy named Reija Sakurai, and looks like, I don't know, he's going to

1073
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:54,120
be singing something for some baumanni game. Poor bastard.

1074
01:25:54,120 --> 01:26:01,320
He could very well be in the... And he'll be giving head at Bellfire.

1075
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:05,120
I know. I wouldn't be surprised if he's in one of the CS songs for popin' music.

1076
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:13,160
I don't know. I'd like to segue for about 30 seconds here

1077
01:26:13,160 --> 01:26:19,120
to give you your In The Groove update. Because everybody, I don't know.

1078
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:23,600

01:27:28,020 --> 01:27:31,040
just a second this is a very special guest and someone I know at least one

1090
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:33,320
person in this room is going to get a kick out of this so I'm actually going

1091
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:41,640
to give them a buzz right now see if we get them online here hello hi is this

1092
01:27:41,640 --> 01:27:54,760
Travis. Travis. Who? You know Travis. Yes. Hi. Hi. Hi. How are you? I'm good. How are

1093
01:27:54,760 --> 01:27:59,140
you guys? Good. I thought maybe you'd want to say hello because this is the first time

1094
01:27:59,140 --> 01:28:03,980
Iguana Girl and I have been on the air together since Under Station Live. And with everything

1095
01:28:03,980 --> 01:28:09,260
that's happened in the last couple weeks, this is proof, Armageddon is here. That's

1096
01:28:09,260 --> 01:28:12,740
Travis, I miss you, I love you!

1097
01:28:12,740 --> 01:28:16,100
And you're looking good, baby.

1098
01:28:16,100 --> 01:28:19,580
He's stalking you on our webcam right now. Hey, hey, 40 pounds lost, baby.

1099
01:28:19,580 --> 01:28:25,180
Looking good. Put your pants back on, Travis, please.

1100
01:28:25,180 --> 01:28:29,180
I don't think Jenna would like that. I know. I like doing it in my pants.

1101
01:28:29,180 --> 01:28:34,420
Alright, Travis, do you have anything you want to plug?

1102
01:28:34,420 --> 01:28:41,260
oh geez is this is this okay I'm off the air no I'm just I'm just asking the

1103
01:28:41,260 --> 01:28:44,100
logical follow-up questions or anything no the logical follow-up question would

1104
01:28:44,100 --> 01:28:53,420
be what does he want to plug your button I really have nothing to plug nothing to

1105
01:28:53,420 --> 01:29:01,860
plug we already plugged you that's not the first time that happened what thank

1106
01:29:01,860 --> 01:29:04,980
Thank you. What's going on with Under Station Live?

1107
01:29:04,980 --> 01:29:08,140
Not a damn thing. Well, that's why I wanted to give you a chance

1108
01:29:08,140 --> 01:29:14,220
to plug it, so folks can go listen to it. Why?

1109
01:29:14,220 --> 01:29:19,920
We don't even listen to it. We don't even do the show.

1110
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:25,100
You don't do the show anymore? Well, if that's what you call wasting a Saturday...

1111
01:29:25,100 --> 01:29:28,420
I thought that's what you... That's what we always used to do!

1112
01:29:28,420 --> 01:29:31,660
I know, what's changed since Jessica and I were on there?

1113
01:29:31,660 --> 01:29:41,060
a baby. Aw. Kira. How is the baby doing? She's a little shit. I bet she makes a lot of little

1114
01:29:41,060 --> 01:29:49,900
shits too. No, she makes big shits. Have fun. Big, stinky, chunky shits. Are you going to

1115
01:29:49,900 --> 01:29:58,060
get her to play DDR? Oh, in your wildest dreams, meat boy. I had to ask. I still love that,

1116
01:29:58,060 --> 01:30:02,700
I still love that Too Unlimited video you did.

1117
01:30:02,700 --> 01:30:07,100
I actually just watched it just the other day, again.

1118
01:30:07,100 --> 01:30:11,780
I had been working on others, but my job, fortunately, takes so much time away from

1119
01:30:11,780 --> 01:30:15,340
me, I don't even have time to sit down and update my life journal.

1120
01:30:15,340 --> 01:30:18,180
Yeah, we noticed.

1121
01:30:18,180 --> 01:30:21,180
Thank you.

1122
01:30:21,180 --> 01:30:25,200
How are things on the left coast?

1123
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:26,200
Left as always.

1124
01:30:26,200 --> 01:30:27,200
It's good.

1125
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:41,000
I don't know, sunny, I don't know, rainy, angry, sad, sad, mad, well actually, let me

1126
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:46,800
ask Rob this, how do you feel about yourself, you Rob, running for public office?

1127
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:51,720
I've contemplated it, I seriously have, but I just don't think, because kids don't vote,

1128
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:54,520
the youth doesn't vote, I think if I were to run, I would have to get the youth vote

1129
01:30:54,520 --> 01:30:57,720
connection and in this area which has a bunch of retired citizens that ain't

1130
01:30:57,720 --> 01:31:00,200
gonna happen I've given it serious thought in the

1131
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:05,200
past though well have I got news for you what's that all right is everybody

1132
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:12,400
sitting down okay everybody got their towel okay don't forget you're down I

1133
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:18,300
have an announcement mmm what's this as I talk really close to the mic okay well

1134
01:31:18,300 --> 01:31:19,820
We can hear you just fine.

1135
01:31:19,820 --> 01:31:21,740
Okay, so, Rich, shut up.

1136
01:31:21,740 --> 01:31:23,420
Shh.

1137
01:31:23,420 --> 01:31:26,980
Shh.

1138
01:31:26,980 --> 01:31:31,220
Seeing what has happened in the last two weeks with the election,

1139
01:31:31,220 --> 01:31:34,820
a country divided, one side against another,

1140
01:31:34,820 --> 01:31:40,820
people burning down houses, cars, accosting people,

1141
01:31:40,820 --> 01:31:42,140
half the country likes one person,

1142
01:31:42,140 --> 01:31:44,020
half the country likes the other person,

1143
01:31:44,020 --> 01:31:46,920
I've decided to take a stand.

1144
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:54,920
I, Travis Donovan, officially announce my candidacy for President of the United States in 2008.

1145
01:31:56,920 --> 01:31:58,920
Travis, wait, wait, wait, wait, Travis.

1146
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:02,920
Hang on, make me stop the music.

1147
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:07,920
You're not going to be 35 by then.

1148
01:32:08,920 --> 01:32:11,920
You have to be 35 at the time of the inauguration.

1149
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:13,720
Mm-mm.

1150
01:32:13,720 --> 01:32:20,800
Birth certificates can be altered by a month.

1151
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:25,300
I have decided I am running for president, and if that doesn't work, I'm running for

1152
01:32:25,300 --> 01:32:27,560
governor of Texas in 06.

1153
01:32:27,560 --> 01:32:38,080
Thank you, thank you, hang on, hang on, I got my crowd here too.

1154
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:39,080
There we go.

1155
01:32:39,080 --> 01:32:41,840
Well, you do realize what this means.

1156
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:44,540
Now I have to run.

1157
01:32:44,540 --> 01:32:47,540
Far, far away.

1158
01:32:47,540 --> 01:32:49,040
Damn it.

1159
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:53,040
I just put that whole rant in my live journal about how I wasn't going to move to Canada,

1160
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:54,740
but now I'm reconsidering.

1161
01:32:54,740 --> 01:32:58,340
Well, I have two propositions for you on that.

1162
01:32:58,340 --> 01:33:01,840
Are you going to legalize gay marriage?

1163
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:03,640
Let's not go there yet.

1164
01:33:03,640 --> 01:33:08,540
Because after all, after all, I'm the working man for the working people.

1165
01:33:08,540 --> 01:33:09,240
All right.

1166
01:33:09,240 --> 01:33:10,340
I work.

1167
01:33:10,340 --> 01:33:12,540
thank you

1168
01:33:12,540 --> 01:33:15,120
now here's my proposition for iraq

1169
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:16,940
i'm running for president alright

1170
01:33:16,940 --> 01:33:17,920
i'm gonna need

1171
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:21,180
a vice presidential candidate

1172
01:33:21,180 --> 01:33:24,900
you're it rob

1173
01:33:24,900 --> 01:33:28,420
i'm sorry there but wait a minute you're a public and i'm a democrat could that

1174
01:33:28,420 --> 01:33:31,580
ever possibly work

1175
01:33:31,580 --> 01:33:32,680
yeah i'm your point

1176
01:33:32,680 --> 01:33:34,700
we'll find out all right

1177
01:33:34,700 --> 01:33:38,700
this is a perfect opportunity like i've been ranting about in my life to throw

1178
01:33:38,700 --> 01:33:44,140
away the stupid bipartisan bullshit. That's right. Travis and I can come together.

1179
01:33:44,140 --> 01:33:48,060
Advance in the party mindset. But, but, but, but, but.

1180
01:33:48,060 --> 01:33:53,260
We can come on each other, we can come together. Now, you're making a Guana girl sad because

1181
01:33:53,260 --> 01:33:56,780
she doesn't know what she's going to do. She doesn't get to be Vice President. What can

1182
01:33:56,780 --> 01:34:01,820
she do? Let's fire Condoleezza Rice and put Jess in

1183
01:34:01,820 --> 01:34:02,820
there. No.

1184
01:34:02,820 --> 01:34:03,820
No? No.

1185
01:34:03,820 --> 01:34:07,260
What does she get to do? Because I, I don't want to do.

1186
01:34:07,260 --> 01:34:09,300
I get to stand around and have big boobs?

1187
01:34:09,300 --> 01:34:11,020
No, I...

1188
01:34:11,020 --> 01:34:15,140
Secretary of Big Boobs, there's an idea.

1189
01:34:15,140 --> 01:34:20,140
No, I actually gave that some thought. Jess can be Secretary of, uh, Agriculture.

1190
01:34:20,140 --> 01:34:25,420
So long as I get to play with the cows!

1191
01:34:25,420 --> 01:34:29,900
You have to be the Secretary of Agriculture, eh heh!

1192
01:34:29,900 --> 01:34:31,460
Because I figure if you want a

1193
01:34:31,460 --> 01:34:37,220
woman who PMS's as far down on the chain of succession as possible...

1194
01:34:37,220 --> 01:34:47,380
I haven't calmed down at all I'm just zoning you Travis now great you just

1195
01:34:47,380 --> 01:34:54,340
lost us a boat way to go way to go Travis I didn't say everybody was gonna

1196
01:34:54,340 --> 01:35:00,060
like us I'm honest and upfront about it I'm gonna be plain spoken for the plain

1197
01:35:00,060 --> 01:35:05,820
spoken people I will have no problem telling candidates to shut the fuck up I

1198
01:35:05,820 --> 01:35:14,820
I will have no problems pointing out that my running mate is gay.

1199
01:35:14,820 --> 01:35:18,820
I don't need the other candidates to tell me this. I've known this.

1200
01:35:18,820 --> 01:35:20,820
I'm here!

1201
01:35:20,820 --> 01:35:25,820
Just like, what was the point of John Kerry pointing out to Dick Cheney that his daughter was gay?

1202
01:35:25,820 --> 01:35:30,820
No shit, I think he knows.

1203
01:35:30,820 --> 01:35:32,820
Actually, that was some words that did that, but yeah.

1204
01:35:32,820 --> 01:35:36,820
Were you expecting him to have a revelation and a heart attack right then and there, going,

1205
01:35:36,820 --> 01:35:39,820
JESUS, HE'S GAY!

1206
01:35:39,820 --> 01:35:42,820
I don't think so.

1207
01:35:42,820 --> 01:35:43,820
But...

1208
01:35:43,820 --> 01:35:49,820
I'm seriously considering this. It's a grassroots campaign. It's a third-party kind of thing.

1209
01:35:49,820 --> 01:35:52,820
Well, we have to come up with a name for the third party.

1210
01:35:52,820 --> 01:35:53,820
The People's Party!

1211
01:35:53,820 --> 01:35:55,820
The People's Party!

1212
01:35:55,820 --> 01:35:56,820
I like that.

1213
01:35:56,820 --> 01:35:57,820
And if anybody can access the social...

1214
01:35:57,820 --> 01:35:58,820
The Social Party!

1215
01:35:58,820 --> 01:35:59,820
The House.

1216
01:35:59,820 --> 01:36:03,380
It could be the house party.

1217
01:36:03,380 --> 01:36:07,260
Travis and Rob's house party, all at once!

1218
01:36:07,260 --> 01:36:08,260
I like it.

1219
01:36:08,260 --> 01:36:09,260
Totally live!

1220
01:36:09,260 --> 01:36:14,220
Well, we're going to have to get my people in touch with your people, and people things.

1221
01:36:14,220 --> 01:36:17,340
I don't see that happening.

1222
01:36:17,340 --> 01:36:21,420
You think I'm all crazy because I live out here in Texas because, oh, I'm sorry, as people

1223
01:36:21,420 --> 01:36:25,100
have pointed out in this last week, I'm a redneck because I live in Texas.

1224
01:36:25,100 --> 01:36:26,740
Well, no.

1225
01:36:26,740 --> 01:36:29,340
I don't think you're a redneck, maybe a...

1226
01:36:29,340 --> 01:36:35,980
And as people pointed out, now it's time for the South to secede.

1227
01:36:35,980 --> 01:36:41,500
Yes, the rest of us are going to form the United States of Canada, hahaha, you're right.

1228
01:36:41,500 --> 01:36:44,140
Well, this is my second condition.

1229
01:36:44,140 --> 01:36:48,340
If you're serious about going to Canada, along with all these other people who want to leave

1230
01:36:48,340 --> 01:36:49,340
the country...

1231
01:36:49,340 --> 01:36:50,340
Of which I am not.

1232
01:36:50,340 --> 01:36:51,380
I would never leave to Canada.

1233
01:36:51,380 --> 01:36:56,500
If you were to sign a legal binding document that you will get your ass out and never come

1234
01:36:56,500 --> 01:37:00,500
I will personally start donating to the U-Haul truck to get you the fuck out.

1235
01:37:00,500 --> 01:37:05,500
And I will use big bills.

1236
01:37:05,500 --> 01:37:12,500
As I've said before, just because the guy I did not vote for and did not want to win won,

1237
01:37:12,500 --> 01:37:15,500
that does not mean I hide my tail behind my legs and go to Canada.

1238
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:18,500
That just means I have to yell a little louder.

1239
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:20,500
No, you just sit there and bitch and whine.

1240
01:37:20,500 --> 01:37:23,500
Exactly! That's what we do! It's the American way!

1241
01:37:23,500 --> 01:37:27,500
Damn straight! America, fuck yeah!

1242
01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:29,500
Exactly. Exactly.

1243
01:37:29,500 --> 01:37:32,500
No, but my question was, did you...

1244
01:37:32,500 --> 01:37:33,500
Sorry.

1245
01:37:33,500 --> 01:37:40,500
Did you expect, Rob, on the next day, Wednesday, to see a big gloating thing in my LiveJournal?

1246
01:37:40,500 --> 01:37:42,500
Actually, no.

1247
01:37:42,500 --> 01:37:43,500
Why?

1248
01:37:43,500 --> 01:37:46,500
Because I think everybody knows that kind of stuff's in poor taste.

1249
01:37:46,500 --> 01:37:50,500
Obviously not a lot of people in LiveJournal did.

1250
01:37:50,500 --> 01:37:54,060
i didn't really feel a lot of gloating i mean if anybody i'm not going to be

1251
01:37:54,060 --> 01:37:54,740
holding

1252
01:37:54,740 --> 01:37:57,900
most of the people i knew if they go out and i could have said well california

1253
01:37:57,900 --> 01:38:00,980
went blue so you know but you know

1254
01:38:00,980 --> 01:38:02,840
but i mean it doesn't matter i mean

1255
01:38:02,840 --> 01:38:05,920
it happened so only half a california went blue

1256
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:08,400
uh... fifty five percent went blue get it right

1257
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:12,140
that's half of california only forty four percent

1258
01:38:12,140 --> 01:38:16,340
anyway yeah discount the uh... over four million popular vote

1259
01:38:16,340 --> 01:38:17,100
anyway

1260
01:38:17,100 --> 01:38:18,140

1270
01:38:41,680 --> 01:38:45,460
it gives the small counties with the sluts population right back when i had

1271
01:38:45,460 --> 01:38:47,720
a debate on this show we have stupid

1272
01:38:47,720 --> 01:38:54,600
12 year old games to be talking about, okay? Speaking of stupid 12 year old games, are

1273
01:38:54,600 --> 01:39:02,600
you going to be on Halo 2? Of course. I get to, I get to frag a fag, I get to frag a fag.

1274
01:39:02,600 --> 01:39:06,760
Yeah, most people in Texas would be, you know, happy about that. Anyway, no I'm kidding.

1275
01:39:06,760 --> 01:39:15,400
Oh come on, it's been four years since we lynched a queer. I accept, I accept your challenge

1276
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:24,280
Mr. Donovan. Well, you better, Mr. Roberts. And then when I kill you, I'm going to say,

1277
01:39:24,280 --> 01:39:30,280
ha ha, you got your ass kicked by a fag. Just like I do to the little hecklers that try

1278
01:39:30,280 --> 01:39:34,700
to challenge me on ER. And then at that point, I run over you in the warthog. And then we

1279
01:39:34,700 --> 01:39:38,480
put Jenna's ten-year-old nephew on, and he kicks both our asses, which he does on a regular

1280
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:42,920
basis. Alright. Which is scary. Alright, we gotta cut it short, because we gotta get to

1281
01:39:42,920 --> 01:39:52,120
the bit that we stole from usl okay what bit uh the match game you copyright stealing motherfucking

1282
01:39:52,120 --> 01:39:58,120
i wouldn't have been copywritten before yeah you stole it copywritten and trademarked

1283
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:07,800
but i stole it like 100th time down the line it's homage imitation is the finest form of flattery

1284
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:15,200
Love you Travis. Yeah, whatever. Bye. Bye. Bye Travis. That was nice to have him on the

1285
01:40:15,200 --> 01:40:19,480
show. Yay, Travis. That's exciting. I've never been asked to be a vice presidential candidate

1286
01:40:19,480 --> 01:40:25,320
before. I've been asked to be somebody's maid of honor, but never the vice presidential

1287
01:40:25,320 --> 01:40:29,320
candidate. That's going to be amazing. I'm excited. Alright, we are going to open it

1288
01:40:29,320 --> 01:40:34,520
up for Match Game in just a minute. However, we had one other person that wanted to talk

1289
01:40:34,520 --> 01:40:38,280
to us in the studio. Yes, we're going to make another call, believe it or not. So let's

1290
01:40:38,280 --> 01:40:41,520
go ahead and make that call right now.

1291
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:46,600
Oh, there we go. Yay.

1292
01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:48,440
One ringy tingy.

1293
01:40:48,440 --> 01:40:49,640
Hello?

1294
01:40:49,640 --> 01:40:53,520
Hi, is this Shane?

1295
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:54,360
Yeah.

1296
01:40:54,360 --> 01:40:57,920
We can barely hear you. Can you talk louder or something?

1297
01:40:57,920 --> 01:40:59,280
Is this loud?

1298
01:40:59,280 --> 01:41:03,440
Somewhat. We can like barely, barely hear you. What's up?

1299
01:41:03,440 --> 01:41:06,440
That sucks. Nothing. Can't yell.

1300
01:41:06,440 --> 01:41:11,440
Oh, okay. Well, what's up? You wanted to say hello to some folks here, or what's up?

1301
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:13,440
Yeah, hi everybody.

1302
01:41:13,440 --> 01:41:16,440
Hi.

1303
01:41:16,440 --> 01:41:18,440
How's it going for you?

1304
01:41:18,440 --> 01:41:19,440
I'm sick.

1305
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:22,440
You're sick? Oh, another sick person. Great.

1306
01:41:22,440 --> 01:41:23,440
Yeah.

1307
01:41:23,440 --> 01:41:24,440
What are you sick with?

1308
01:41:24,440 --> 01:41:26,440
Well, I'm puking. I'm not sure.

1309
01:41:26,440 --> 01:41:31,440
Oh. Well, unfortunately the volume is so low that it's hard for us to hear you right now,

1310
01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:34,960
Anything you wanted to say since we called you?

1311
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:43,800
I want to say that everybody needs to buy Karaoke Revolution for Xbox this week so Halo

1312
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:49,000
2 doesn't take out all the sales, because I don't want to keep filling Halo 2 this week.

1313
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:58,360
And watch Drawn Together on Comedy Central because it's funny, and that's it.

1314
01:41:58,360 --> 01:42:01,360
Is there any UltraMix 2 songs you're looking forward to?

1315
01:42:02,360 --> 01:42:04,360
Yeah, but I can't say them.

1316
01:42:04,360 --> 01:42:07,360
Oh, I thought he was going to say Baille La Samba.

1317
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:09,360
Oh, well I already said that last time.

1318
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:10,360
Alright.

1319
01:42:10,360 --> 01:42:11,360
Okay, Baille La Samba.

1320
01:42:11,360 --> 01:42:14,360
We'll play Baille La Samba just for you a little later.

1321
01:42:14,360 --> 01:42:15,360
Okay, cool.

1322
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:19,360
Alright, well I'm sorry, we're going to have to let you go because it's too quiet, but you have a good one, okay?

1323
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:20,360
Okay, you too.

1324
01:42:20,360 --> 01:42:21,360
Everyone say bye, Shane!

1325
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:22,360
Bye!

1326
01:42:22,360 --> 01:42:24,360
Come back to California, you bum!

1327
01:42:26,360 --> 01:42:27,360
Alright, I hope you heard that.

1328
01:42:27,360 --> 01:42:32,560
that. They said, come back to California, you bum, and play Final Fantasy. I think you

1329
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:36,200
already hung up. Oh well. Hopefully he hears that when it comes through a little later.

1330
01:42:36,200 --> 01:42:44,000
All right. Let's see. What we're going to do now, should we get into match game? You

1331
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,760
guys want to take a quick break? All right, let's go get into match game. I got to find

1332
01:42:46,760 --> 01:42:51,240
the match game music though. How about a one song break? We want to do like just a quick

1333
01:42:51,240 --> 01:42:55,120
little break while we set up. That would be good. A quick one song break. You know, everybody's

1334
01:42:55,120 --> 01:42:59,680
been wanting to hear music last time you did you find that match game music for

1335
01:42:59,680 --> 01:43:05,700
us and in this break I know there was another ultra mix to be rare song the

1336
01:43:05,700 --> 01:43:10,140
folks wanted to hear so let's see if we can find that for the folks out there

1337
01:43:10,140 --> 01:43:14,560
what was the song that I wanted to play for people it's called set people on

1338
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:21,120
fire I don't remember what was it oh it's by

1339
01:43:21,120 --> 01:43:24,360
la samba since we just talked to Shane of course we're gonna play this one we'll

1340
01:43:24,360 --> 01:43:28,360
We'll be back right after this. It's Bylela Samba from DDR Ultramix 2. We'll be back.

1341
01:43:54,360 --> 01:43:58,360
That's my mama, and I count my five

1342
01:43:58,360 --> 01:44:01,360
Five days, that's my five days

1343
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:04,360
And that's where I'm gonna be going

1344
01:44:34,360 --> 01:44:40,360
And you for her soul, finally a summer

1345
01:44:40,360 --> 01:44:45,360
And I'll come your way, finally, finally

1346
01:44:45,360 --> 01:45:11,280
We are back here on Orange Launch Radio, we're going to get into the Mani Match Game, pretty

1347
01:45:11,280 --> 01:45:16,960
soon here we're just trying to get the files copied over that we need all right

1348
01:45:16,960 --> 01:45:20,320
so the way this works we're gonna open up the skype line in just a minute and

1349
01:45:20,320 --> 01:45:23,640
just as a reminder there's a little bit of a buffer so you're gonna want to

1350
01:45:23,640 --> 01:45:27,240
watch for the little icon to turn to green because that's really the moment

1351
01:45:27,240 --> 01:45:30,480
when we're starting to take calls so the first person through will get to play

1352
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:35,000
match game tonight and you get to challenge somebody in the room but not

1353
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,480
one of the hosts you have to challenge a guest because that's the rule that I

1354
01:45:37,480 --> 01:45:41,600
I just made up. That was very is it of you.

1355
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:48,680
Thank you. Cake or death. So you get to challenge one of the guests and all the other guests

1356
01:45:48,680 --> 01:45:52,920
will be answering questions. So the way match game works, we have a little statement that

1357
01:45:52,920 --> 01:45:57,160
we read and the statement has a blank in it. And then you have to fill in the blank. You

1358
01:45:57,160 --> 01:46:00,720
want to try and match as many other people in the room on the blank as you can. We're

1359
01:46:00,720 --> 01:46:03,360
going to make it a quick game tonight because Sharks Girl and Float Walk unfortunately have

1360
01:46:03,360 --> 01:46:06,200
to get out of here pretty soon. So we have to kind of make it a quick game. It's going

1361
01:46:06,200 --> 01:46:10,640
be a three question game tonight. It's like Mad Libs Only Not. Yes, it's like Mad Libs

1362
01:46:10,640 --> 01:46:16,480
Only Not. Very good. So, let's find ourselves some match game music here. It's not the same

1363
01:46:16,480 --> 01:46:29,480
match game theme, but it's good. Price is Right Car Music. A new car! You've won a Geo

1364
01:46:29,480 --> 01:46:36,160
Metro. Alright. Oh! Let's see what happens when we open it up and get a collar. And it

1365
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:38,880
remember if we can't hear you very well

1366
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:42,460
we are going to have to boot you and get somebody else so the skype line is open

1367
01:46:42,460 --> 01:46:44,080

1489
01:53:47,920 --> 01:53:50,840
That's close to hot, but not close enough.

1490
01:53:50,840 --> 01:53:55,140
Loki must be very gay.

1491
01:53:55,140 --> 01:53:59,280
I think he went for the obvious one.

1492
01:53:59,280 --> 01:54:01,840
I was going to put gay people, I'm like, no wait, that's what the question was the other

1493
01:54:01,840 --> 01:54:03,840
way around.

1494
01:54:03,840 --> 01:54:12,840
I said karaoke must be very much for people into water sports because the box is yellow.

1495
01:54:12,840 --> 01:54:21,800
It's all tied up with a big nothing.

1496
01:54:21,800 --> 01:54:24,000
Let's go to the next question, shall we?

1497

I'm your number one fan.

1529
01:57:02,620 --> 01:57:04,620
I pick these just for you.

1530
01:57:08,120 --> 01:57:10,620
Sadly enough, I could see that happening with some of our listeners.

1531
01:57:10,620 --> 01:57:12,620
Uh, I'm just kidding. Love you guys.

1532
01:57:12,620 --> 01:57:16,620
Uh, I'm your number one pick every time.

1533
01:57:16,620 --> 01:57:18,620
Iguana Girl.

1534
01:57:18,620 --> 01:57:21,860
I-ironically, mine's actually along the same vein.

1535
01:57:21,860 --> 01:57:24,860
Okay. Huge piles of feces!

1536
01:57:24,860 --> 01:57:27,900
Huge piles of feces!

1537
01:57:27,900 --> 01:57:30,820
Not a match.

1538
01:57:30,820 --> 01:57:35,020
Alright, uh, Arcadian, we're looking for, I forgot the answers now already, what do you think you want?

1539
01:57:35,020 --> 01:57:36,980
A big package

1540
01:57:36,980 --> 01:57:38,900
with a karaoke machine

1541
01:57:38,900 --> 01:57:45,780
of Politary's greatest hits. Oh, a karaoke machine of Politary's greatest hits.

1542
01:57:45,780 --> 01:57:47,000
Chirp, chirp.

1543
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:55,520
Loki. No, it's sad that no one got Jamie's because mine was the king of the cosmos, Severed

1544
01:57:55,520 --> 01:58:03,200
Cock. That would be a big package. Mine's somewhat similar. I said that she burninated

1545
01:58:03,200 --> 01:58:10,620
everything when she saw that the present was a dildo modeled after Naoki.

1546
01:58:10,620 --> 01:58:16,820
How would I find it? Let's move on. All right. Very nice. All right.

1547
01:58:16,820 --> 01:58:21,900
all tied up 0-0. John, you gonna break this tie? We'll see. Navi, you gonna break this

1548
01:58:21,900 --> 01:58:31,020
tie? Maybe. Alright, we'll see. Here we go. Question number three. We here at Orange Lounge

1549
01:58:31,020 --> 01:58:37,820
Radio have become very concerned about Loki. When haven't we? But here we go. We've been

1550
01:58:37,820 --> 01:58:43,340
very concerned about Loki. He's been playing a lot of Grand Theft Auto this week. And he

1551
01:58:43,340 --> 01:58:47,940
started to blur the line between San Andreas in real life.

1552
01:58:47,940 --> 01:58:54,940
The other co-hosts got very concerned of this when Loki went around and blank.

1553
01:58:56,540 --> 01:58:59,040
The other co-hosts got very concerned that

1554
01:58:59,040 --> 01:59:21,360
Loki was taking Grand Theft Auto a little too seriously when Loki went around and blanked.

1555
01:59:21,360 --> 01:59:26,600
celebrities are currently thinking. Please wait.

1556
01:59:34,480 --> 01:59:40,640
All right. Well, let's see. Are we gonna get a winner? We'll find out. Anybody still

1557
01:59:40,640 --> 01:59:49,640
working? All right. Here we go. All right. It all comes down to this. We here at

1558
01:59:49,640 --> 01:59:52,940
Orange Lounge Radio. I've become very concerned about Loki. He's been playing a lot of Grand

1559
01:59:52,940 --> 01:59:56,420
Theft Auto this week, and he's starting to blur the line between San Andreas and Real

1560
01:59:56,420 --> 02:00:00,420
Life. The other co-host got very concerned at this when Loki went around and... Navi?

1561
02:00:00,420 --> 02:00:06,980
Bustin' a cap on yo ass! Bustin' a cap on yo ass! Let's see. John, the other co-host

1562
02:00:06,980 --> 02:00:12,060
got very concerned at this when Loki went around and... Hurt other people. Hurt other

1563
02:00:12,060 --> 02:00:18,460
people. Alright. Not very specific, but we'll see. Sometimes our guests can't be very specific.

1564
02:00:18,460 --> 02:00:21,740
find out. DarkSakura, you became concerned of this when-

1565
02:00:21,740 --> 02:00:25,740
He was saying it before I was still writing. Oh, I'm sorry.

1566
02:00:25,740 --> 02:00:30,740
In the outfit of some stereotypical thug and tried to jack a plane, crash into the ocean,

1567
02:00:30,740 --> 02:00:33,980
steal a semi and listen to the light at them while shooting at people.

1568
02:00:33,980 --> 02:00:37,780
Very descriptive. I like that, but not a match. Shooting at people.

1569
02:00:37,780 --> 02:00:42,780
All right. Well, but it's a little too much. But it doesn't necessarily mean I hit them,

1570
02:00:42,780 --> 02:00:45,140
therefore not hurting them. All right.

1571
02:00:45,140 --> 02:00:46,980
Uh, Flow-Walk.

1572
02:00:46,980 --> 02:00:51,100
Uh, chase them with the purple dildo. Chase them with the purple dildo!

1573
02:00:51,100 --> 02:00:52,140
Not a match.

1574
02:00:52,140 --> 02:00:53,220
Starscroll.

1575
02:00:53,220 --> 02:00:59,420
Jumped out of a plane screaming, it's a mile drop, I'll live!

1576
02:00:59,420 --> 02:01:01,140
This is true, this is true.

1577
02:01:01,140 --> 02:01:02,100
Islander.

1578
02:01:02,100 --> 02:01:04,860
When he said, bitch, I'm gonna kill you!

1579
02:01:04,860 --> 02:01:08,420
Bitch, I'm gonna kill you! Very close to capping your ass, but not quite.

1580
02:01:08,420 --> 02:01:11,100
Iguana Girl. That was boring. Hijacked a helicopter.

1581
02:01:11,100 --> 02:01:13,180
Hijacked a helicopter.

1582
02:01:13,180 --> 02:01:17,180
You know, that would have been exciting if Loki really did that, but I don't think I would have been concerned.

1583
02:01:17,180 --> 02:01:20,180
I would have been, you know how to fly a helicopter? We'll see.

1584
02:01:20,180 --> 02:01:21,180
Alright, Arkadian.

1585
02:01:21,180 --> 02:01:22,180
Ran over pedestrians.

1586
02:01:22,180 --> 02:01:24,180
Ran over pedestrians.

1587
02:01:24,180 --> 02:01:25,180
He does that anyway.

1588
02:01:25,180 --> 02:01:26,180
Not a match, he does that anyway.

1589
02:01:26,180 --> 02:01:27,180
Uh, Loki.

1590
02:01:27,180 --> 02:01:29,180
I would have figured that would have been a match, actually.

1591
02:01:29,180 --> 02:01:31,180
Alright, let's see here.

1592
02:01:31,180 --> 02:01:35,180
Shooting the po-po and pipping crack hoes to make some fat scratch.

1593
02:01:35,180 --> 02:01:38,180
Wow.

1594
02:01:38,180 --> 02:01:39,180
Lovely.

1595
02:01:39,180 --> 02:01:40,180
Lovely.

1596
02:01:40,180 --> 02:01:45,140
Uh, and my answer was, uh, the other co-hosts got very concerned in this one, Loki went

1597
02:01:45,140 --> 02:01:48,060
around and, uh, killed Dark Sacro with his Pip-Cane.

1598
02:01:48,060 --> 02:01:56,260
I got a ferret thrown at me for that one.

1599
02:01:56,260 --> 02:02:00,300
Alright, well, let's review the scores, boys and girls.

1600
02:02:00,300 --> 02:02:05,980
Let's look at how our contestants did tonight.

1601
02:02:05,980 --> 02:02:08,560
Let's look at the final scores.

1602
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:14,720
And then in second place is Nabby with zero points.

1603
02:02:17,160 --> 02:02:22,040
And a tie for second place is John Fields with zero points.

1604
02:02:22,040 --> 02:02:24,680
Congratulations John and Nabby,

1605
02:02:24,680 --> 02:02:27,500
you are our big losers tonight.

1606
02:02:27,500 --> 02:02:30,980
So Nabby, you get a frown, a collective frown

1607
02:02:30,980 --> 02:02:33,840
from those of us in studio, ready?

1608
02:02:33,840 --> 02:02:38,120
Alright, and John, do you know what you get for your score tonight?

1609
02:02:38,120 --> 02:02:39,520
A frown from the chat room.

1610
02:02:39,520 --> 02:02:41,520
No, you get hung up on.

1611
02:02:41,520 --> 02:02:48,080
Aww, what a good sport, alright, he tried, they always fall for it, I hang up on them

1612
02:02:48,080 --> 02:02:50,080
every time, they always fall for it.

1613
02:02:50,080 --> 02:02:54,680
Alright, alright, no, thanks seriously for playing John Fields, it was a good time.

1614
02:02:54,680 --> 02:02:58,400
Too bad about the, you know, no answers or anything, but no, it happens.

1615
02:02:58,400 --> 02:03:02,680
Anyway, I guess, um, Sarkskull and Floatwalk are going to have to be leaving us soon because

1616
02:03:02,680 --> 02:03:07,880
I got a long drive home. But, you know, I quickly wanted to ask Floor Walk and Sharks

1617
02:03:07,880 --> 02:03:17,360
Girl just some, you know, general questions. Floor Walk, anything, I guess I should ask

1618
02:03:17,360 --> 02:03:21,480
you about the Ultramix 2. I know there's a lot of things you can and can't say. You did

1619
02:03:21,480 --> 02:03:25,160
mention that you're working somewhere else now, but you still have to follow the NDA

1620
02:03:25,160 --> 02:03:27,000
or they come after you with their PIP canes, right?

1621
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:30,640
Eh, for what it's worth. For what it's worth. But I want to ask you,

1622
02:03:30,640 --> 02:03:32,640
Can you tell us anything about the release date?

1623
02:03:32,640 --> 02:03:34,640
Because that's kind of a big question mark right now, do we know?

1624
02:03:34,640 --> 02:03:40,640
Last I checked, it's roughly going to be around like November 18th I think it was, because actually it was

1625
02:03:40,640 --> 02:03:46,640
I was hanging out with Jason Enos last night, so he gave us kind of a scoop on why there were delays and all that kind of stuff

1626
02:03:46,640 --> 02:03:54,640
And it's actually pretty funny, but only people who were in the test group would appreciate such bumblings I guess

1627
02:03:54,640 --> 02:03:55,640
For like a better term

1628
02:03:55,640 --> 02:03:57,640
You know what, I was starting to get a little nervous there

1629
02:03:57,640 --> 02:03:59,640
That we were going to have to wait for Christmas to see UltraMix 2

1630
02:03:59,640 --> 02:04:02,440
But it's good to know that it looks like it's still on target, anyway.

1631
02:04:02,440 --> 02:04:04,920
Yeah, it's looking to be pretty good.

1632
02:04:04,920 --> 02:04:08,440
I mean, right now, things are pretty happy in the DDR camp.

1633
02:04:08,440 --> 02:04:13,960
Xtreme sales have actually, well, what Jason did was he was comparing Max2 sales along

1634
02:04:13,960 --> 02:04:17,840
with Xtreme, how they've been doing week by week, and Xtreme's been doing a good, like,

1635
02:04:17,840 --> 02:04:21,640
up to around 33% better than what Max2 has been doing.

1636
02:04:21,640 --> 02:04:22,640
Very nice!

1637
02:04:22,640 --> 02:04:25,160
So they're looking, even projecting around holiday season, they're probably going to

1638
02:04:25,160 --> 02:04:29,000
be jumping Max2 figures by about 40%.

1639
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:35,000
So, you know, things are going well for that. Max 2 has almost hit 500,000 units.

1640
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:36,000
Very nice.

1641
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:39,000
So, you know, I mean, who knows? It could be a greatest hit someday, but...

1642
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:46,000
Interesting. Interesting. So, what do you think? Now, I know you're not there anymore, so you can't really say one way or the other because you don't know,

1643
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:49,000
but what do you think the chances are we're going to see some kind of Xtreme 2 next year?

1644
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:58,000
Well, it's pretty safe to say. I mean, if it's a profitable franchise, you just keep milking it for what it's worth.

1645
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:02,200
It's, I mean, good thing about DDR is even though the gameplay is pretty, you know, basic,

1646
02:05:02,200 --> 02:05:06,720
it's always progressive with its music, so the music will always drive sales and, you

1647
02:05:06,720 --> 02:05:09,000
know, people to try new titles.

1648
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:14,280
Oh, yeah, okay. Hopefully if there is an Xtreme 2, they'll have the sense of humor to make

1649
02:05:14,280 --> 02:05:17,000
it purple.

1650
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:20,560
That would be very funny. You gotta let Jason know that from Orange Launch Radio, that we

1651
02:05:20,560 --> 02:05:26,400
want to make Xtreme 2 purple, if it happens, if it is Xtreme 2.

1652
02:05:26,400 --> 02:05:30,040
Now some interesting news has been going around about Ultramix 2 is the song packs, they did

1653
02:05:30,040 --> 02:05:33,200
say on The Freak that there's going to be what, 7 through 12 I think they said?

1654
02:05:33,200 --> 02:05:34,200
Uh, yeah.

1655
02:05:34,200 --> 02:05:35,200
What's going to happen?

1656
02:05:35,200 --> 02:05:37,800
Maybe every month, every other month, we don't really know?

1657
02:05:37,800 --> 02:05:42,240
I'll just say I wouldn't be surprised if they spaced them out a little longer than once

1658
02:05:42,240 --> 02:05:43,240
a month.

1659
02:05:43,240 --> 02:05:44,240
Okay.

1660
02:05:44,240 --> 02:05:45,240
Yeah.

1661
02:05:45,240 --> 02:05:46,400
Alright, well we're definitely looking at this.

1662
02:05:46,400 --> 02:05:52,320
From what I've seen, there's definitely some very interesting choices, like things that

1663
02:05:52,320 --> 02:05:54,280
the hardcore Bimani people would be very uh...

1664
02:05:54,280 --> 02:05:56,680
Oh, so you know about some of the stuff that's coming up?

1665
02:05:56,680 --> 02:05:57,720
Dude, I know everything.

1666
02:05:57,720 --> 02:05:59,080
Oh, oh, sorry.

1667
02:05:59,080 --> 02:06:01,200
Oh, watch out.

1668
02:06:01,200 --> 02:06:02,880
All right.

1669
02:06:02,880 --> 02:06:03,640
Yeah.

1670
02:06:03,640 --> 02:06:05,680
All right, anything else you want to share we

1671
02:06:05,680 --> 02:06:08,520
should be looking forward to from the world of Konami?

1672
02:06:08,520 --> 02:06:10,680
It's kind of hard to say because, I mean,

1673
02:06:10,680 --> 02:06:14,120
for all intents and purposes, everything's been released out

1674
02:06:14,120 --> 02:06:16,280
for this fall.

1675
02:06:16,280 --> 02:06:18,960
Probably the last game that's going to be pretty big

1676
02:06:18,960 --> 02:06:21,920
for those who are into the RPGs 2 and 4 will

1677
02:06:21,920 --> 02:06:24,040
be coming out early January.

1678
02:06:24,040 --> 02:06:26,540
Cool. I got to play a demo with that, actually. It was pretty fun.

1679
02:06:26,540 --> 02:06:30,340
Yeah, I mean, the only cool thing is, you know, I'll get to see my writing in there.

1680
02:06:30,340 --> 02:06:31,440
Oh, very cool.

1681
02:06:31,440 --> 02:06:37,440
Yeah, because me and another guy had actually helped do some translation or, like, rewriting for that project itself.

1682
02:06:37,440 --> 02:06:39,040
Great.

1683
02:06:39,040 --> 02:06:42,740
Yeah, that's the main stuff from Konami for now. I mean...

1684
02:06:42,740 --> 02:06:46,540
Now, are you going to come back after Ultramix 2 is released?

1685
02:06:46,540 --> 02:06:50,940
Are you going to come back to the show and kind of, you know, fill us in on how this happened and this...

1686
02:06:50,940 --> 02:06:53,900
because now, you know, all the information will be out there. You get to tell us a little

1687
02:06:53,900 --> 02:06:55,340
bit more about how it all happened, or?

1688
02:06:55,340 --> 02:06:58,560
Oh, definitely. I mean, I'd be more than willing to, you know, come up here and talk about

1689
02:06:58,560 --> 02:07:02,620
stories of, you know, like, songs and, like, who got to do this. I mean, you'll probably

1690
02:07:02,620 --> 02:07:06,340
find out who did what steps and then, like, what caused us to think, you know, why we

1691
02:07:06,340 --> 02:07:10,100
did that pattern and all that kind of stuff. There are definitely some interesting stories,

1692
02:07:10,100 --> 02:07:14,500
and you'd be surprised at, like, some of the songs that people like on the V-Rays and stuff,

1693
02:07:14,500 --> 02:07:18,300
but there were actually some testers who did not want to touch certain songs whatsoever.

1694
02:07:18,300 --> 02:07:20,300
We're gonna have to hear about that.

1695
02:07:20,300 --> 02:07:23,300
There's plenty of interesting gossip that will go down afterwards.

1696
02:07:23,300 --> 02:07:29,300
Now if I'm not mistaken though, there's still about half the song list we don't even know yet still.

1697
02:07:29,300 --> 02:07:36,300
Oh yeah, there's some things that people don't know about and there's a lot of funny things too.

1698
02:07:36,300 --> 02:07:43,300
Although it kind of sucked in a way that the viewer had more or less spoiled some of the things we wanted to keep really top secret.

1699
02:07:43,300 --> 02:07:48,300
You know what though? When you stop giving clues, we have nothing to do, so...

1700
02:07:48,300 --> 02:07:53,300
And, you know, I mean, GameStop employees can't be quiet to save their lives.

1701
02:07:53,300 --> 02:07:58,300
Are they ever gonna, you know, tell us, give us more clues, give us a song list here?

1702
02:07:58,300 --> 02:08:00,300
Probably not, because we're only about ten days out.

1703
02:08:00,300 --> 02:08:01,300
Nah, it just ain't happening.

1704
02:08:01,300 --> 02:08:03,300
You're no fun. That's all right.

1705
02:08:03,300 --> 02:08:08,300
Actually, I mean, it's, um, upper management has been really stressed out from UltraMix II,

1706
02:08:08,300 --> 02:08:24,300
Ultramix 2, just trying to basically get it in before, you know, I mean our target date was actually probably the second week, basically around the same time Halo 2 was supposed to come out, you know, 11th we were looking at, but it got pushed back, but I mean, just kind of stuff happens in the business.

1707
02:08:24,300 --> 02:08:33,300
So, you know, and it's also interesting because we've heard that some things change with Ultramix 2 as well, some song-less changes happen, some things behind the scenes, so, you know, maybe they had to go back and do something else.

1708
02:08:33,300 --> 02:08:38,540
Yeah, I mean it's not uncommon to have one song one minute and then like a couple versions later

1709
02:08:38,540 --> 02:08:43,900
Yeah, we decided not to have it. I mean people, you know, I think I mentioned one time about Dancing Stage Unleashed

1710
02:08:43,900 --> 02:08:45,380
You know there was supposed to be

1711
02:08:45,380 --> 02:08:51,140
You know like a certain song and then which is actually slated for was supposed to be for the US Max

1712
02:08:51,140 --> 02:08:52,980
So I think those grooves into heart. Yeah, okay

1713
02:08:52,980 --> 02:08:57,820
Yeah, it was supposed to be on US Max II but just never made it for one reason or another and I mean, of course

1714
02:08:57,820 --> 02:09:01,660
You're probably never gonna hear from me about what songs didn't make it and it would actually

1715
02:09:01,660 --> 02:09:05,580
Actually, sad part is I do have one to tell, but it just breaks my heart to even think

1716
02:09:05,580 --> 02:09:06,580
about it.

1717
02:09:06,580 --> 02:09:07,580
Oh, wow.

1718
02:09:07,580 --> 02:09:09,060
It was really good, folks.

1719
02:09:09,060 --> 02:09:10,060
Wow.

1720
02:09:10,060 --> 02:09:11,060
Oh, yeah, you got me all...

1721
02:09:11,060 --> 02:09:12,060
You're gonna have to...

1722
02:09:12,060 --> 02:09:14,980
Now, see, in a year, nobody will care, so y'all have to tell us in a year.

1723
02:09:14,980 --> 02:09:18,140
Unless someone shoots me up with some, like, sodium pentothal or something like that.

1724
02:09:18,140 --> 02:09:19,140
I think we can arrange that.

1725
02:09:19,140 --> 02:09:20,140
All right.

1726
02:09:20,140 --> 02:09:21,140
Well, thanks for coming by, Mel.

1727
02:09:21,140 --> 02:09:22,380
You're welcome back anytime, of course.

1728
02:09:22,380 --> 02:09:23,380
Oh, always.

1729
02:09:23,380 --> 02:09:24,380
It's always a blast up here.

1730
02:09:24,380 --> 02:09:25,380
And good luck with Spot.

1731
02:09:25,380 --> 02:09:26,380
Let us know when Spot relaunches.

1732
02:09:26,380 --> 02:09:30,340
Yeah, I'll definitely drop you a line probably in the next Orange Lounge chat or whatever,

1733
02:09:30,340 --> 02:09:35,700
Then we'll probably announce what our contest will be in DDR Spot for the Kira CDs.

1734
02:09:35,700 --> 02:09:39,420
I mean, one will probably be, just to kind of give a teaser to people, it'll probably

1735
02:09:39,420 --> 02:09:43,740
involve something about fan art dealing with Silent Hill 4.

1736
02:09:43,740 --> 02:09:45,220
Ooh, get your pens ready.

1737
02:09:45,220 --> 02:09:49,260
So we'll have like some kind of certain theme plotted out and then see what people can do

1738
02:09:49,260 --> 02:09:50,260
with it.

1739
02:09:50,260 --> 02:09:54,860
And kind of off topic, my own personal plug, I'm going to be selling a Silent Hill 4 stand

1740
02:09:54,860 --> 02:09:56,180
up display.

1741
02:09:56,180 --> 02:10:01,400
If anyone wants it, uh, I'll be putting it somewhere on someplace and I'll sell it or

1742
02:10:01,400 --> 02:10:02,400
whatever.

1743
02:10:02,400 --> 02:10:05,460
I'll probably post it on to LiveJournal, um, Silent Hill Forum.

1744
02:10:05,460 --> 02:10:06,860
Alright, Vanessa.

1745
02:10:06,860 --> 02:10:07,860
Sharks Girl?

1746
02:10:07,860 --> 02:10:08,860
Yeah?

1747
02:10:08,860 --> 02:10:12,020
I just, I didn't want to neglect you, you're sitting there and you look kinda, you know,

1748
02:10:12,020 --> 02:10:13,020
bored.

1749
02:10:13,020 --> 02:10:14,020
No, I'm kidding.

1750
02:10:14,020 --> 02:10:15,020
No, I just feel kinda hot, so.

1751
02:10:15,020 --> 02:10:18,140
It is kinda hot in here, but I, any exciting plans?

1752
02:10:18,140 --> 02:10:20,900
Any exciting plans for the next few weeks for you?

1753
02:10:20,900 --> 02:10:25,900
Try not to murder my fellow co-workers that I can't stand.

1754
02:10:25,900 --> 02:10:29,900
Try not to walk out on my job because I really need money. That's about it.

1755
02:10:29,900 --> 02:10:32,900
Well, I want to come down now. We're going to have a Dave & Buster's Play Day pretty soon.

1756
02:10:32,900 --> 02:10:34,900
And we can harass a new friend of mine who works there.

1757
02:10:34,900 --> 02:10:36,900
Yay, harassment! I like that idea.

1758
02:10:36,900 --> 02:10:37,900
Harassment is fun.

1759
02:10:37,900 --> 02:10:40,900
And what else am I going to ask you? How's hockey going?

1760
02:10:40,900 --> 02:10:41,900
Oh, God.

1761
02:10:41,900 --> 02:10:43,900
Does it look like it might get better?

1762
02:10:43,900 --> 02:10:46,900
No. They're being stupid morons. The players are being idiots.

1763
02:10:46,900 --> 02:10:51,660
It's from what I hear from friends who actually have contacts in the upper level of sharks

1764
02:10:51,660 --> 02:10:57,060
management, the owners are willing to negotiate and work on it and the players aren't.

1765
02:10:57,060 --> 02:11:02,700
They're saying we want what we want, too damn bad, so from what I hear the sharks are planning

1766
02:11:02,700 --> 02:11:08,820
that there won't be a season this year, which pisses me off, but it saves my wallet, so

1767
02:11:08,820 --> 02:11:09,820
you know hey.

1768
02:11:09,820 --> 02:11:10,820
I guess there's a bright side.

1769
02:11:10,820 --> 02:11:12,780
So yeah, it could be all bad.

1770
02:11:12,780 --> 02:11:15,760
Well if there is a season, like a partial season, like they ended up doing with baseball

1771
02:11:15,760 --> 02:11:22,520
or something. Hope your Sharks can win it. Hey, we're undefeated! Woo! Nothing, nothing.

1772
02:11:22,520 --> 02:11:28,080
We rule. It's just like our match game tonight. Very good. Alright. Are you guys sticking

1773
02:11:28,080 --> 02:11:33,520
around? Are you guys going to be taken off too, or? Okay, because I want to talk to WannaGirl

1774
02:11:33,520 --> 02:11:36,300
when we get back about a promotion she got recently. I want to talk to her about what's

1775
02:11:36,300 --> 02:11:40,440
going on with the Freaks, so we'll talk about that when we get back. So we are going to

1776
02:11:40,440 --> 02:11:46,280
another break. How about some more 2DX Red stuff? Navi, as our kind of resident whore

1777
02:11:46,280 --> 02:11:50,760
who knows a little bit more about this stuff, why don't you pick some songs for us that

1778
02:11:50,760 --> 02:12:00,760
you want our chat room to hear? Which one? What's the... Okay, we're going to hear Horizon

1779
02:12:00,760 --> 02:12:07,520
and what else do you want to hear? We're going to hear Death Disco, Texture. I'm sorry, it's

1780
02:12:07,520 --> 02:12:14,520
Lake with texture.

1781
02:12:37,520 --> 02:12:41,520
I can't seriously think about calling in tomorrow, but you know, hey.

1782
02:12:41,520 --> 02:12:46,520
Someday, someday we're going to bring the show over there to your neck of the woods.

1783
02:12:46,520 --> 02:12:49,520
We've got to someday. Someday when we have a three-day weekend.

1784
02:12:49,520 --> 02:12:52,520
Footwalk, any pre-emptive FUs you've got to get out for?

1785
02:12:52,520 --> 02:12:57,520
Oh man, well, I guess just FU2.

1786
02:12:57,520 --> 02:13:02,520
Just FU2, like game companies point out too many damn games and just, man,

1787
02:13:02,520 --> 02:13:06,560
basically for not giving me enough time to play everything

1788
02:13:06,560 --> 02:13:10,080
and FU2 on my new job, I was supposed to start Monday but

1789
02:13:10,080 --> 02:13:13,300
they said they couldn't start me till Wednesday and

1790
02:13:13,300 --> 02:13:17,100
whatever hurts my bank account really just makes it go FU

1791
02:13:17,100 --> 02:13:21,460
I hear that. Alright guys thanks for coming we'll see you later okay?

1792
02:13:21,460 --> 02:13:24,440
Almost definitely, the sooner the better. Have a good one. Here we go we're gonna go to break

1793
02:13:24,440 --> 02:13:26,120
we'll be back, show's not over yet though

1794
02:13:26,120 --> 02:13:28,940
we're just losing a couple people because they got a long drive but we got plenty of show

1795
02:13:28,940 --> 02:13:35,940

1796
02:15:28,940 --> 02:15:30,940
You

1797
02:16:28,940 --> 02:16:32,940
Ain't no love to be free

1798
02:16:33,940 --> 02:16:36,940
But it's all me

1799
02:16:38,940 --> 02:16:40,940
But I know

1800
02:16:41,940 --> 02:16:44,940
There's no reason

1801
02:19:14,940 --> 02:19:38,940
Orange Lounge Radio, we put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.

1802
02:19:38,940 --> 02:19:43,500
It's server made a bit my dad number it's server made a bit my dad number

1803
02:19:43,820 --> 02:19:49,780
We are back here on orange lounge radio. We gotta get the cages by sharks girl. Bye for a walk. Have a good one

1804
02:19:49,780 --> 02:19:54,980
Thanks for coming. Um, they got a long drive back guys. So they're good sports for coming all the way down here to

1805
02:19:55,680 --> 02:19:57,680
Come on our show and eat Mongolian

1806
02:19:58,900 --> 02:20:02,140
Cuz Mongolians are yummy. We've got a whole lot of show laughs

1807
02:20:02,140 --> 02:20:04,060
We gotta get to the cage nice gotta get the F use of the week

1808
02:20:04,060 --> 02:20:06,900
But you know, we have we haven't really gotten it. There's so many guests here tonight

1809
02:20:06,900 --> 02:20:10,900
We haven't really gotten to talk to a lot of them, so I wanted to say hello to Iguana Girl real fast.

1810
02:20:10,900 --> 02:20:11,400
Hi.

1811
02:20:11,400 --> 02:20:16,400
And you just recently got a promotion over on that one DDR site I've heard of.

1812
02:20:16,400 --> 02:20:19,400
Yeah, yeah, that place. Yeah, yeah.

1813
02:20:19,400 --> 02:20:21,400
We adoringly call it The Freak.

1814
02:20:21,400 --> 02:20:21,900
Yeah.

1815
02:20:21,900 --> 02:20:22,900
The DDR Freak.

1816
02:20:22,900 --> 02:20:28,900
Yeah, it's not like a huge thing, but yeah, I'm the head administrator over at DDR Freak now, so...

1817
02:20:28,900 --> 02:20:30,900
But that doesn't mean you replaced J-Dog.

1818
02:20:30,900 --> 02:20:33,400
No, no, no, no, no. Basically...

1819
02:20:33,400 --> 02:20:40,000
King of all cosmos, aka Spike, has not been able to put the amount of time into the site

1820
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:45,680
that he would want to, so he decided to step down and I was put into his place, so now

1821
02:20:45,680 --> 02:20:50,440
basically I'm helping out with the forums and keeping things hunky-dory on the forums

1822
02:20:50,440 --> 02:20:51,440
and whatnot.

1823
02:20:51,440 --> 02:20:53,560
It's a hell of an undertaking, I bet.

1824
02:20:53,560 --> 02:20:58,480
Yeah, we've got a lot of projects that we're working on right now and trying to get squared

1825
02:20:58,480 --> 02:21:03,720
away so so yeah it's a lot of stuff to do but I've got such a wonderful crew

1826
02:21:03,720 --> 02:21:08,240
that I'm working with I mean everybody's just fabulous to work with so includes

1827
02:21:08,240 --> 02:21:11,520
our very own dark side yes as well as Islanders and next to you over there yes

1828
02:21:11,520 --> 02:21:15,400
he's our staff members several folks listening tonight I'm fast but judging

1829
02:21:15,400 --> 02:21:18,480
from our chat so hi you guys thanks for listening tonight the exchange next be

1830
02:21:18,480 --> 02:21:22,480
in Sherlock yes of course Jason I know I saw Sherlock blue in there earlier this

1831
02:21:22,480 --> 02:21:26,680
is great thank you guys for listening and I know you probably can't say a

1832
02:21:26,680 --> 02:21:30,320
whole lot, but anything exciting coming to The Freak in the near future you might look

1833
02:21:30,320 --> 02:21:31,320
forward to?

1834
02:21:31,320 --> 02:21:35,120
Um, I can't really say anything about it right now.

1835
02:21:35,120 --> 02:21:36,120
Okay, that's fine.

1836
02:21:36,120 --> 02:21:41,560
There's a lot of stuff that's really up in the air, but don't be surprised if you start

1837
02:21:41,560 --> 02:21:43,440
seeing some changes around the site.

1838
02:21:43,440 --> 02:21:45,640
Ooh, that's always a good one to leave people with.

1839
02:21:45,640 --> 02:21:46,640
Yeah, yeah.

1840
02:21:46,640 --> 02:21:48,360
How did you get involved with that anyway?

1841
02:21:48,360 --> 02:21:54,120
Because you know, I remember that you and I, we had our first DDR experience together

1842
02:21:54,120 --> 02:21:56,040
Yes, October 2000, yeah.

1843
02:21:56,040 --> 02:21:59,920
And then about a year after that, we weren't talking to each other, then suddenly, suddenly

1844
02:21:59,920 --> 02:22:04,000
you were running up the corporate ladder, a DDR freak, out in the open.

1845
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:05,000
What happened?

1846
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:08,560
Well, I, you know, just through the site, I mean, back in the old boards, you know,

1847
02:22:08,560 --> 02:22:14,020
the green boards, as we, you know, affectionately call them, I started to get to know some people,

1848
02:22:14,020 --> 02:22:19,040
and Jamie and I were becoming really, really close friends, and what ended up happening

1849
02:22:19,040 --> 02:22:25,540
was she introduced me to some other people, which introduced me to some other people,

1850
02:22:25,540 --> 02:22:36,160
which ended up basically with me speaking with Sinan, with Pock Eye Kenobi, and he ended

1851
02:22:36,160 --> 02:22:43,000
up going in and we chatted and after some conversations and such, what was it, around

1852
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:48,560
Miggle 2, the Milpitas Golf Land Tournament 2, was when he decided that, you know,

1853
02:22:48,560 --> 02:22:51,240
hey, let's make you a mod and blah, blah, blah.

1854
02:22:51,240 --> 02:22:57,000
I remember seeing the nomination thread and being so proud.

1855
02:22:57,000 --> 02:23:00,280
See, I never, I don't even remember any of that, but...

1856
02:23:00,280 --> 02:23:03,720
I was surprised because it was just, it was, you know, out of the blue for me, but...

1857
02:23:03,720 --> 02:23:05,520
Well, good job. Congratulations to you.

1858
02:23:05,520 --> 02:23:08,120
Yeah, that was August 2001.

1859
02:23:08,120 --> 02:23:13,680
Out of curiosity, now there have been several mods on DDRFreak that don't, you know, mod

1860
02:23:13,680 --> 02:23:18,720
anymore basically. How many of the mods that were there when you started are still there?

1861
02:23:18,720 --> 02:23:21,560
I know Jamie's one. Islander's one.

1862
02:23:21,560 --> 02:23:23,680
Yeah, well, no, he's staff now.

1863
02:23:23,680 --> 02:23:24,680
Oh, he's staff.

1864
02:23:24,680 --> 02:23:25,680
That was one of the projects that was undertaken.

1865
02:23:25,680 --> 02:23:26,680
My bad, my bad. Sorry guys, my bad.

1866
02:23:26,680 --> 02:23:34,440
One of my projects was getting a lot of the ineffective mods, unfortunately. Yeah, so,

1867
02:23:34,440 --> 02:23:39,240
We've moved a lot of people over to staff because there's still definitely a benefit

1868
02:23:39,240 --> 02:23:43,120
to the site, but they're not able to put the time towards the site.

1869
02:23:43,120 --> 02:23:46,120
Sort of recognize what they've done.

1870
02:23:46,120 --> 02:23:48,560
We still appreciate all of their input.

1871
02:23:48,560 --> 02:23:54,920
It's not like they are suddenly dumb because they're not mods or something like that.

1872
02:23:54,920 --> 02:24:00,960
We appreciate their input and we appreciate every bit of advice and instruction they can

1873
02:24:00,960 --> 02:24:10,440
give us and the like, but honestly, I can't think of too many people.

1874
02:24:10,440 --> 02:24:14,280
Somebody was mentioning that to me the other day, I thought that was kind of interesting.

1875
02:24:14,280 --> 02:24:22,720
Yeah, I think that there's Jamie and I'm trying to think.

1876
02:24:22,720 --> 02:24:23,720
J-Dog?

1877
02:24:23,720 --> 02:24:28,080
Well, J-Dog, he owns the site, so that doesn't really count.

1878
02:24:28,080 --> 02:24:29,080
Interesting, very interesting.

1879
02:24:29,080 --> 02:24:32,080
Um, what else do I want to ask you?

1880
02:24:32,080 --> 02:24:37,080
Okay, now, just between you and me, because nobody listens to this show, okay?

1881
02:24:37,080 --> 02:24:41,080
Which forum is the biggest bitch to handle?

1882
02:24:41,080 --> 02:24:44,080
Um, see, that's the funny thing, is everybody else...

1883
02:24:44,080 --> 02:24:50,080
Yeah, see, Mr. Islander is, you know, coffee gunner is with Random Chat,

1884
02:24:50,080 --> 02:24:52,080
but I don't mind Random Chat.

1885
02:24:52,080 --> 02:24:53,080
Random Chat's fun.

1886
02:24:53,080 --> 02:24:56,080
I like Random Chat. I mean, it's like the evolution.

1887
02:24:56,080 --> 02:24:58,080
I do too, but I refuse to get involved in political discussions.

1888
02:24:58,080 --> 02:25:04,960
You see, here's my problem. My most hated forum would be DDR chit-chat, because that's

1889
02:25:04,960 --> 02:25:09,960
where you get all of the newbies going, oh my god, DDR is so much fun, I love it, oh

1890
02:25:09,960 --> 02:25:15,520
my god! And yeah, I can't hang with that.

1891
02:25:15,520 --> 02:25:19,320
I'm going to tape that and send you a DDR Freak promo or something.

1892
02:25:19,320 --> 02:25:24,000
Yeah, I just can't hang with that. I can't deal with that every single day.

1893
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:29,920
It's weird. You are the... DDR Freak is visited by gazillions of people. That's an official

1894
02:25:29,920 --> 02:25:34,800
record. Gazillions of people. How much do you play DDR anymore?

1895
02:25:34,800 --> 02:25:41,800
I don't. Unless you count Thumb Thumb Revolution, I have not played DDR in 2004.

1896
02:25:43,680 --> 02:25:46,560
How many of those mods actually play DDR? Quite a few.

1897
02:25:46,560 --> 02:25:49,920
Really? Surprisingly enough, actually it's about a

1898
02:25:49,920 --> 02:25:53,160
three-quarter split, I would imagine. So here's the logical follow-up question.

1899
02:25:53,160 --> 02:25:56,160
If you don't play DDR anymore, what the hell are you doing?

1900
02:25:56,160 --> 02:25:57,160
It's the community.

1901
02:25:57,160 --> 02:25:58,160
It's the community.

1902
02:25:58,160 --> 02:26:01,160
All of you dumb fucks out there, I love you to death!

1903
02:26:01,160 --> 02:26:02,160
I'm kidding.

1904
02:26:02,160 --> 02:26:04,160
You pissed me off, but I love you.

1905
02:26:04,160 --> 02:26:05,160
I love you, goodnight.

1906
02:26:05,160 --> 02:26:07,160
No, no, seriously.

1907
02:26:07,160 --> 02:26:11,160
That's what drew me to it, to begin with.

1908
02:26:11,160 --> 02:26:13,160
It was just like Rocky for me.

1909
02:26:13,160 --> 02:26:19,160
I started out with Rocky because it seemed like it was fun, I get to go dance and sing

1910
02:26:19,160 --> 02:26:22,160
and all that fun jazz and whatnot on stage.

1911
02:26:22,160 --> 02:26:29,440
stage, but what kept me there, despite everything else, was the community, the family that you

1912
02:26:29,440 --> 02:26:36,040
grow from it, and that's honestly been the best experience about DDR for me, was the

1913
02:26:36,040 --> 02:26:44,120
camaraderie that I've felt this big, huge, happy family that has all of its fucked up

1914
02:26:44,120 --> 02:26:45,600
drama from time to time.

1915
02:26:45,600 --> 02:26:51,580
I absolutely agree on this, especially with this little bastardist, cancerous community

1916
02:26:51,580 --> 02:26:57,120
we've created here on Orange Lounge. I just, I love it. And you know what though? One day,

1917
02:26:57,120 --> 02:27:01,160
Orange Lounge, not going to be able to just be Bemani anymore. I think someday we're going

1918
02:27:01,160 --> 02:27:03,880
to get, we're going to outgrow our shoes. We're going to have to grow to video gaming.

1919
02:27:03,880 --> 02:27:07,200
So, I'm looking forward to hopefully being able to work with some stuff, you know, now

1920
02:27:07,200 --> 02:27:11,920
that we're cool again. Especially being able to work with some stuff with DDR Freak and,

1921
02:27:11,920 --> 02:27:19,400
you know, because. And oh my God, maybe, Orange Lounge and DDR Freak Radio Crossovers? I didn't

1922
02:27:19,400 --> 02:27:25,760
say that I didn't say it but I'm not I'm not they're gonna I'm not they're gonna

1923
02:27:25,760 --> 02:27:32,920
confirm nor deny those reports we shall soon see it could be some interesting

1924
02:27:32,920 --> 02:27:38,840
things happening this November we'll see possibly possibly all right well Islander

1925
02:27:38,840 --> 02:27:41,880
I got I don't want to leave you out of the fun because we're talking about a

1926
02:27:41,880 --> 02:27:46,920
girl but how did you know you were one of the first people on DDR freak would

1927
02:27:46,920 --> 02:27:54,080
you? Yes. How did this whole damn phenomenon get started? Well, the story goes, there was

1928
02:27:54,080 --> 02:28:00,960
a group of guys that I saw playing DDR, you know, way back in the day at Milpitas Golf

1929
02:28:00,960 --> 02:28:04,840
Land, the first time I ever saw this machine, and I started noticing, I started seeing the

1930
02:28:04,840 --> 02:28:10,680
same people over and over again, like, i.e. Floatwalk, who was just here, at least, who

1931
02:28:10,680 --> 02:28:18,680
left actually, J-Dog, Pokai Kenobi, and we started talking to one another, and we started

1932
02:28:18,680 --> 02:28:26,920
seeing each other more and more and more. Next thing I know, Jason comes up with a website

1933
02:28:26,920 --> 02:28:33,960
with a huge long URL. It was something at Berkeley, at EDU, and da da da da da da da.

1934
02:28:33,960 --> 02:28:35,560
Sad thing is, I remember that site.

1935
02:28:35,560 --> 02:28:37,640
You remember that? It was, oh, it was horrible.

1936
02:28:37,640 --> 02:28:41,640
No, when I first... NS3 was the NS3 site that we came on board with.

1937
02:28:41,640 --> 02:28:49,640
Yeah, the NS3.net was next. And just kind of progressed from there, how quickly people caught on and how much people loved it.

1938
02:28:49,640 --> 02:28:54,640
And it's really amazing how much the site has really grown.

1939
02:28:54,640 --> 02:28:58,640
It is amazing. I mean, my god.

1940
02:28:58,640 --> 02:29:00,640
45,000 members.

1941
02:29:00,640 --> 02:29:02,640
How many hits a day?

1942
02:29:02,640 --> 02:29:06,240
I wouldn't even know what the stats are, to be honest, but let me put it this way, the

1943
02:29:06,240 --> 02:29:11,720
reason why we can't keep the video section up is the sheer amount of bandwidth that is

1944
02:29:11,720 --> 02:29:18,040
used would cost us probably a good $500 a month in hosting fees alone.

1945
02:29:18,040 --> 02:29:19,040
Now I got a good idea.

1946
02:29:19,040 --> 02:29:20,040
At least.

1947
02:29:20,040 --> 02:29:21,040
At least.

1948
02:29:21,040 --> 02:29:22,440
You guys should do one of those Winamp TV things for streaming videos.

1949
02:29:22,440 --> 02:29:23,440
Hmm.

1950
02:29:23,440 --> 02:29:24,440
You're kind of cute.

1951
02:29:24,440 --> 02:29:25,440
Maybe.

1952
02:29:25,440 --> 02:29:27,240
Just remember, I suggested it, okay?

1953
02:29:27,240 --> 02:29:29,280
I want my credit.

1954
02:29:29,280 --> 02:29:34,900
And a lot of people have suggested BitTorrent for it, but part of the problem with that

1955
02:29:34,900 --> 02:29:41,580
is A, we're talking about, you know, the common user here, and a lot of common users aren't

1956
02:29:41,580 --> 02:29:42,900
going to be able to figure out BitTorrent.

1957
02:29:42,900 --> 02:29:43,900
Yet.

1958
02:29:43,900 --> 02:29:44,900
At least right now.

1959
02:29:44,900 --> 02:29:45,900
Yeah.

1960
02:29:45,900 --> 02:29:46,900
At least for right now.

1961
02:29:46,900 --> 02:29:49,460
I mean, obviously, you know, things like IRC were foreign to people back in the day, but...

1962
02:29:49,460 --> 02:29:53,500
If you haven't guessed, DDR Freecast to cater to the lowest common denominator sometimes.

1963
02:29:53,500 --> 02:29:54,500
Yes, unfortunately.

1964
02:29:54,500 --> 02:29:55,500
I was in...

1965
02:29:55,500 --> 02:29:58,700
No, I'm going to be high school.

1966
02:29:58,700 --> 02:30:03,700
I wasn't going to name names, I was just going to say complete idiots, but you know.

1967
02:30:03,700 --> 02:30:06,700
Or, you know, as she said, the newbies, which I actually love!

1968
02:30:06,700 --> 02:30:07,700
Because that was one of my...

1969
02:30:07,700 --> 02:30:08,700
Some newbies are cute!

1970
02:30:08,700 --> 02:30:10,700
Well, no, because that was my...

1971
02:30:10,700 --> 02:30:12,700
That used to be... exactly.

1972
02:30:12,700 --> 02:30:16,700
If you go to the site, I am still listed as the DDR Amsobor.

1973
02:30:16,700 --> 02:30:17,700
Amsobor.

1974
02:30:17,700 --> 02:30:19,700
Ambassador, misspelled.

1975
02:30:19,700 --> 02:30:21,700
But anyway, because I loved going...

1976
02:30:21,700 --> 02:30:27,700
See, one of the things I loved to do way back when was I loved to go to various arcades, talk to people, get them interested,

1977
02:30:27,700 --> 02:30:32,700
And I just loved going around meeting people who played the game.

1978
02:30:32,700 --> 02:30:37,700
For example, when the Sacramento crew came down to the Bay Area...

1979
02:30:37,700 --> 02:30:40,700
And everybody hated us. Remember that?

1980
02:30:40,700 --> 02:30:43,700
Isn't that funny, iguana girl? I just want to point this out.

1981
02:30:43,700 --> 02:30:50,700
We were the bastard children of the DDR community for the longest time, and now she's the queen of the goddamn forum.

1982
02:30:50,700 --> 02:30:54,700
I just want to point that out. That is hilarious to me.

1983
02:30:54,700 --> 02:30:58,700
Meanwhile, the people that chastise us, chastise us are banned!

1984
02:30:58,700 --> 02:31:10,700
Exactly, exactly. But I mean, I was, I made a trip down there to meet you guys and see who else played the game and kind of meet everyone and kind of went from there.

1985
02:31:10,700 --> 02:31:15,700
First time I met Jess and Jamie and you were there as well.

1986
02:31:15,700 --> 02:31:25,180
I believe, just looking at the chat room, I do remember seeing Tetsuya there, a few

1987
02:31:25,180 --> 02:31:26,180
other people.

1988
02:31:26,180 --> 02:31:27,180
I remember Prestige.

1989
02:31:27,180 --> 02:31:29,340
Yes, yes, he was there too.

1990
02:31:29,340 --> 02:31:31,220
Wow, a lot of names.

1991
02:31:31,220 --> 02:31:35,700
And you were there, and you were there, and you were there.

1992
02:31:35,700 --> 02:31:36,700
Exactly.

1993
02:31:36,700 --> 02:31:37,700
Alright.

1994
02:31:37,700 --> 02:31:38,700
Yeah.

1995
02:31:38,700 --> 02:31:41,700
And he said I had big tits.

1996
02:31:41,700 --> 02:31:42,700
Alright.

1997
02:31:42,700 --> 02:31:46,260
alright are we gonna get what i i think i think that this or the you guys are

1998
02:31:46,260 --> 02:31:47,680
welcome back anytime

1999
02:31:47,680 --> 02:31:50,440
uh... you're you're actually welcome in the south again and i think that all my

2000
02:31:50,440 --> 02:31:54,300
god i'm just you know i'm just messing with it we've got a lot of this that we

2001
02:31:54,300 --> 02:31:57,320
can just be candid about it it's only life's funny

2002
02:31:57,320 --> 02:31:59,040
at the footballs and it

2003
02:31:59,040 --> 02:32:00,420
things change right

2004
02:32:00,420 --> 02:32:02,100
i doubt that there should go anywhere nanny

2005
02:32:02,100 --> 02:32:04,880
cuz i want to talk to you still till after we get the cage measure we got to

2006
02:32:04,880 --> 02:32:08,880
get a little guy thirty minutes left in the show

2007
02:32:08,880 --> 02:32:12,160
Did Jamie just say we skip FUs?

2008
02:32:12,160 --> 02:32:15,640
We should skip FUs so that next week I can do double FUs.

2009
02:32:15,640 --> 02:32:18,800
I don't know about that, Jamie. Maybe we'll have to do a mini FU segment.

2010
02:32:18,800 --> 02:32:22,280
Everybody will have to think of like one really good FU. One really good FU. And that goes for

2011
02:32:22,280 --> 02:32:23,840
chat room too. You only get one

2012
02:32:23,840 --> 02:32:28,160
really good FU tonight, okay? But in the meanwhile, we've got to, got to, got to get to

2013
02:32:28,160 --> 02:32:29,560
tonight's cage match.

2014
02:32:29,560 --> 02:32:33,600
So I'm going to queue it up here and if you want to participate in tonight's cage

2015
02:32:33,600 --> 02:32:34,160
match,

2016
02:32:34,160 --> 02:32:37,920
all you got to do is head on over to our chat room over at

2017
02:32:37,920 --> 02:32:44,240
orange lounge radio dot com and click on chat so let's bring on uh... the cage

2018
02:32:44,240 --> 02:32:49,240
match music jamie's favorite song

2019
02:32:49,240 --> 02:32:51,240
you cannot vote for hollick

2020
02:32:51,240 --> 02:32:54,240
i'm still voting hollick i don't care

2021
02:32:54,240 --> 02:32:56,240

yeah well f u buddy

2025
02:33:03,240 --> 02:33:06,240
alright we'll see what happens we'll see what happens anything's possible

2026
02:33:06,240 --> 02:33:08,240
Let's see how fast we can get through this cage match.

2027
02:33:08,240 --> 02:33:11,240
Last week in the Orange Lawn's cage match, it didn't happen because we weren't here,

2028
02:33:11,240 --> 02:33:12,240
because we had Halloween.

2029
02:33:12,240 --> 02:33:15,240
So, for two weeks running, you have had my pick.

2030
02:33:15,240 --> 02:33:18,240
My pick was the winner of the Orange Lawn's radio cage match.

2031
02:33:18,240 --> 02:33:23,240
It was a song by Ian Van Dow, which you know from Castles in the Sky, Will.i.

2032
02:33:23,240 --> 02:33:25,240
He had a brand new single, it's called Reason,

2033
02:33:25,240 --> 02:33:28,240
and it was the winner of last week's Orange Lawn's, or two weeks ago's,

2034
02:33:28,240 --> 02:33:29,240
Orange Lawn's radio cage match.

2035
02:33:29,240 --> 02:33:33,240
Again, the way the cage match works, we're going to play three songs for you guys,

2036
02:33:33,240 --> 02:33:38,580
A clip of last week's winner and two new songs for you guys in full that each host selects

2037
02:33:38,580 --> 02:33:43,580
You guys vote for your favorite and the winner goes into rotation all week long on

2038
02:33:43,980 --> 02:33:49,360
Orange lounge radios the money music amor program with EDR to the X all that fun stuff and also

2039
02:33:50,180 --> 02:33:54,980
The whole guest here we get to do our best time in town on all the songs that play except for last week's because we

2040
02:33:54,980 --> 02:34:00,660
Already did it last week. So alright, I'll shut up and play a clip of song number one. It is last week's winner

2041
02:34:00,660 --> 02:34:02,660
It's Reason by Iain Bandel.

2042
02:34:30,660 --> 02:34:40,660
Tell me the truth Is there something on your mind?

2043
02:34:40,660 --> 02:34:48,660
Tell me what you hide inside Tell me the truth

2044
02:34:48,660 --> 02:34:55,660
Give me a reason To hold onto what we've got

2045
02:34:55,660 --> 02:35:02,660
There must be a reason to hold on to what we've got

2046
02:35:02,660 --> 02:35:09,660
Give me a reason to hold on to what we've got

2047
02:35:09,660 --> 02:35:16,660
There must be a reason to hold on to what we've got

2048
02:35:19,660 --> 02:35:23,660
Are there things that I should know?

2049
02:35:23,660 --> 02:35:27,660
Will you stay or will you go?

2050
02:35:27,660 --> 02:35:43,660
Okay, that was song number one, last week's winner, or two weeks ago's winner, I should

2051
02:35:43,660 --> 02:35:44,660
say.

2052
02:35:44,660 --> 02:35:48,380
That was Ian Van Dow from the album, Ape with Reason, some happy, poppy trance music.

2053
02:35:48,380 --> 02:35:49,380
Jamie's favorite.

2054
02:35:49,380 --> 02:35:53,700
You gave that song an eight, I just wanted to remind you.

2055
02:35:53,700 --> 02:35:54,700
All right.

2056
02:35:54,700 --> 02:35:55,700
Yes, you did.

2057
02:35:55,700 --> 02:36:00,700
Let's go on, and we're gonna go to Loki's pick for tonight. Loki, what'd you pick out tonight?

2058
02:36:00,700 --> 02:36:05,700
Well, I figured I'd get something really sweet for you guys.

2059
02:36:05,700 --> 02:36:13,700
Earlier in the show, you heard me mention Midihead, basically the guy that did the really kick-ass remix of In Your Eyes.

2060
02:36:13,700 --> 02:36:22,700
And, well, I got another track from him. You won't even find this on his website, because I asked him for it, and he was nice enough to send to me.

2061
02:36:22,700 --> 02:36:24,700
And your internet penis is humongous.

2062
02:36:24,700 --> 02:36:25,700
Yes it is.

2063
02:36:25,700 --> 02:36:32,700
Anyways, this song is featured in one of the trailers, or not, I should say TV spots for Matrix Reloaded.

2064
02:36:32,700 --> 02:36:37,700
And the song is called, um, how was it, Speed Demon.

2065
02:36:37,700 --> 02:36:42,700
And it's by a group, or a guy called Monolithic, and guess who Monolithic is?

2066
02:36:42,700 --> 02:36:45,700
It's Midi Head, and he's the singer, and enjoy.

2067
02:36:45,700 --> 02:36:50,700
Alright, here it is. Song number two tonight. Monolithic, Speed Demon. Enjoy.

2068
02:37:15,700 --> 02:37:24,700
The sun is going down in the west sky And I'm feeling up on a big high

2069
02:37:24,700 --> 02:37:31,700
Wanna get in my car and fly away, fly away, go play

2070
02:37:31,700 --> 02:37:38,700
Turn the key and drop the pedal Gonna keep it down to metal

2071
02:37:38,700 --> 02:37:44,700
Fighting down the open highway, highway, my way

2072
02:37:44,700 --> 02:37:51,700
Are you ready to fly?

2073
02:38:14,700 --> 02:38:23,700
The engine hums as I roll down the window I love the solitude as I feel the wind blow

2074
02:38:23,700 --> 02:38:29,700
With the stereo on and the volume turned on Way off

2075
02:38:29,700 --> 02:38:36,700
The road it winds holding tight to the wheel Got the pedal still slammed through the steel

2076
02:38:36,700 --> 02:38:43,700
I hear the squeal of the tires as they burn up, burn up, burn up

2077
02:39:06,700 --> 02:39:32,180
The sun is going down in the west sky And I'm feeling up, I'm a-be-high

2078
02:39:32,180 --> 02:39:38,840
Wanna' get in my car and fly away, fly away, hey, fly away

2079
02:39:39,840 --> 02:39:45,920
Turn the key and drop the pedal Gonna' keep it down to metal

2080
02:39:45,920 --> 02:39:52,920
Fly down the old big highway Highway, my way

2081
02:39:52,920 --> 02:39:55,860
Gotta' speed team put the pedal down Put the pedal down, put the pedal down

2082
02:39:55,860 --> 02:39:59,160
Gotta' speed team put the pedal down Put the pedal down, to the ground

2083
02:39:59,160 --> 02:40:02,040
Gotta' speed team put the pedal down Put the pedal down, put the pedal down

2084
02:40:02,040 --> 02:40:05,040
Put the pedal down, put the pedal down, put the pedal down

2085
02:40:05,040 --> 02:40:07,040
If you just bow

2086
02:40:35,040 --> 02:40:42,040
Give me your smile

2087
02:40:42,040 --> 02:40:48,040
Give me your smile

2088
02:40:48,040 --> 02:40:55,040
Give me your smile

2089
02:40:55,040 --> 02:40:59,040
You are theur Baldwin!

2090
02:40:59,040 --> 02:41:02,040
You are theur Baldwin!

2091
02:41:02,040 --> 02:41:06,040
You are theur Baldwin!

2092
02:41:06,040 --> 02:41:09,040
You are theur Baldwin!

2093
02:41:09,040 --> 02:41:12,040
You are theur Baldwin!

2094
02:41:12,040 --> 02:41:16,040
You are theur Baldwin!

2095
02:41:19,040 --> 02:41:23,040
You are theur Baldwin!

2096
02:41:23,040 --> 02:41:38,200
Okay, that was song number two in tonight's cage match.

2097
02:41:38,200 --> 02:41:41,800
That was Monolithic with Speed Demon, and we're going to go around and see what everybody

2098
02:41:41,800 --> 02:41:42,800
thought of that one.

2099
02:41:42,800 --> 02:41:46,560
Keep in mind, we're all a little pooped right now, so I don't know how that may affect the

2100
02:41:46,560 --> 02:41:47,560
scores, but let's see.

2101
02:41:47,560 --> 02:41:48,560
Dark Sakura.

2102
02:41:48,560 --> 02:41:49,560
It's not bad.

2103
02:41:49,560 --> 02:41:51,560
Not bad.

2104
02:41:53,560 --> 02:41:55,560
I'd give it a...

2105
02:41:56,560 --> 02:41:58,560
Seven and a half.

2106
02:41:58,560 --> 02:42:00,560
Alright, seven and a half. What's the, uh, iguana girl?

2107
02:42:00,560 --> 02:42:05,560
Sounds like the type of stuff I actually used to listen to, so, um, I'm probably good about seven and a half also.

2108
02:42:05,560 --> 02:42:07,560
Alright, seven and a half iguana girl. Uh, islander?

2109
02:42:08,560 --> 02:42:12,560
Honestly, not my style, but I still enjoyed it anyway. I'd probably still give it a seven.

2110
02:42:12,560 --> 02:42:14,560
Alright, good deal. Uh, Navi?

2111
02:42:14,560 --> 02:42:21,560
The music was pretty good, but then the vocals kind of ruined it for me, sound like Bad Underworld with a cowboy twang, so I give it 7.

2112
02:42:21,560 --> 02:42:23,560
Uh, RKDN.

2113
02:42:24,560 --> 02:42:28,560
Yeah, the background was good, but the guy's saying, leave something to desire, 2.5.

2114
02:42:29,560 --> 02:42:40,560
Um, I've always, you know, I think Midihead's a really talented guy, um, I prefer the In My Eyes remix over that, but uh, it's got a good beat, I think cut down a little bit, that would be like a fun little 2DX song or something.

2115
02:42:40,560 --> 02:42:47,560
or something. Yeah, right. 2DX is going to come out here. So I give it a 7.5 as well.

2116
02:42:47,560 --> 02:42:54,560
Why not? I'll be trending. It's better with the Matrix reloaded visuals with it, but I

2117
02:42:54,560 --> 02:42:59,560
still give it a 9. This is awesome. Alright, remember, it doesn't matter what we think.

2118
02:42:59,560 --> 02:43:04,560
It's all up to you guys. You can choose between Ian Van Dau, that song, and Dark Sakura Song,

2119
02:43:04,560 --> 02:43:06,560
Which we're going to hear next. Dark Sacro, what is it?

2120
02:43:06,560 --> 02:43:14,560
It's by someone named Vlad. It's Supersonic Electronics.

2121
02:43:14,560 --> 02:43:15,560
Okay.

2122
02:43:15,560 --> 02:43:21,560
If anyone happens to be checking random chat on GDR3, they'll know what I was talking about.

2123
02:43:21,560 --> 02:43:29,560
I'm a little concerned, but we'll see. All right. This is Vlad with Electronic Supersonic. Enjoy.

2124
02:43:29,560 --> 02:43:38,240
Hey baby, wake up from your sleep, we have arrived onto the future and the whole world

2125
02:43:38,240 --> 02:43:51,240
is become electronic, supersonic, supersonic, electronic.

2126
02:43:51,240 --> 02:43:58,160
Hey baby, ride with me away, we doesn't have much time, my blue jeans is tight, so onto

2127
02:43:58,160 --> 02:44:04,840
my love rocket climb. Inside tank of fuel is not fuel but love. Above us there is nothing

2128
02:44:04,840 --> 02:44:16,640
above but the stars above. All systems gone, pay pay for down count. 5, 4, 3, 1, off blast.

2129
02:44:16,640 --> 02:44:25,440
Fly away in my space rocket. You no need put money in my pocket. The door is closed I just

2130
02:44:25,440 --> 02:44:31,440
I put my co-plug in your socket.

2131
02:44:31,440 --> 02:44:34,440
The sun and sky is bright like fire.

2132
02:44:34,440 --> 02:44:38,440
You and me gets higher and higher.

2133
02:44:38,440 --> 02:44:42,440
A lot of communication bias.

2134
02:44:42,440 --> 02:44:46,440
Only thing can stop us is flat tire.

2135
02:44:49,440 --> 02:44:53,440
Hey love crusader, I want to be your space invader.

2136
02:44:53,440 --> 02:44:56,440
For you I would descend the deepest moon crater

2137
02:44:56,440 --> 02:44:59,440
I is more stronger than Darth Vapour

2138
02:44:59,440 --> 02:45:02,440
Obey me, I is your new dictator

2139
02:45:02,440 --> 02:45:04,440
For you is Venus, I am Mars

2140
02:45:04,440 --> 02:45:07,440
With you I is more richer than all the stars

2141
02:45:07,440 --> 02:45:09,440
Make our wishes on our shooting stars

2142
02:45:09,440 --> 02:45:13,440
Then for you I will play on my cosmic guitar

2143
02:45:13,440 --> 02:45:17,440
Ladies and gentlemen, fasten your belt please

2144
02:45:17,440 --> 02:45:19,440
We has commenced our descent

2145
02:45:19,440 --> 02:45:23,440
I trust you enjoy this flight, as much as you enjoy this accent.

2146
02:45:23,440 --> 02:45:27,440
Now, back on Earth, it's time for a down splash.

2147
02:45:27,440 --> 02:45:31,440
Into sea of eternal glory, my spaceship crash.

2148
02:45:31,440 --> 02:45:34,440
People have arrived for to cheer me from near and far.

2149
02:45:34,440 --> 02:45:37,440
And as I plot, I open door and shout,

2150
02:45:37,440 --> 02:45:43,440
I am way's biggest washed up superstar!

2151
02:45:43,440 --> 02:45:48,440
Electronic, electronic, as for sure as the sun rises in the west.

2152
02:45:48,440 --> 02:45:52,440
Of all the saints and poets on earth, I am the bestest.

2153
02:45:52,440 --> 02:45:55,440
Come, let me put the ring of Jupiter on your finger.

2154
02:45:55,440 --> 02:45:58,440
Then, like a smell around you, I will never linger.

2155
02:45:58,440 --> 02:46:01,440
Okay, it's time for end. No more will I sang.

2156
02:46:01,440 --> 02:46:06,440
Let me take you back in time. I want for you to experience big bang.

2157
02:46:06,440 --> 02:46:15,440
Long live Space Race. Long live Mofania.

2158
02:46:25,440 --> 02:46:29,440
Quite an interesting reaction both here in studio and in the chat room.

2159
02:46:29,440 --> 02:46:33,440
Will it work out in the song's favor or not? Let's see Darcekra.

2160
02:46:33,440 --> 02:46:43,440
I just cracked up when I first heard that, so I give a ten for you.

2161
02:46:43,440 --> 02:46:45,440
Iguana Girls.

2162
02:46:45,440 --> 02:46:50,440
It's got a nice rhythm and you can dance to it. Nice.

2163
02:46:50,440 --> 02:46:54,440
Uh, Islander.

2164
02:46:54,440 --> 02:46:58,440
I thoroughly enjoyed that. What can I say? It's a ten.

2165
02:46:58,440 --> 02:46:59,440
Navi.

2166
02:46:59,440 --> 02:47:05,800
It makes me giggle like when I heard heterosexuality, but I only have lovers it gets a 10 because it has to win

2167
02:47:07,280 --> 02:47:09,280
Arcadia

2168
02:47:16,440 --> 02:47:20,920
Dark Sakura, this is something I would expect from Loki not from you, but

2169
02:47:21,480 --> 02:47:24,280
based on the butt plug in my socket line

2170
02:47:24,280 --> 02:47:31,280
I'm sorry, it would be a better fortune cookie song than it would be a Cage Mintz song.

2171
02:47:31,280 --> 02:47:33,280
Ooh, someone jealous, someone jealous.

2172

Okay, Loki, what's going on in the sim world?

2191
02:49:01,220 --> 02:49:09,680
Okay, there's been updates to both the In the Groove skin, if no one cares, and the

2192
02:49:09,680 --> 02:49:19,720
DDR red skin, which is meh. And also, StepMania, or at least Candid 2 came out. Okay, that's

2193
02:49:19,720 --> 02:49:26,260
it. Nothing important. Nothing is here. Move along.

2194
02:49:26,260 --> 02:49:32,060
Well that was quick. What can I say about that? Let's see. Well I guess what we can

2195
02:49:32,060 --> 02:49:36,700
do right now while I'm tallying cage match votes. Jamie, why don't you go ahead and plug

2196
02:49:36,700 --> 02:49:39,460
some of those other shows that you can hear on our lovely station.

2197
02:49:39,460 --> 02:49:43,900
I'm sure there's people who would like to give it the plug. I mean, oh, I'm sorry. Tuesday

2198
02:49:43,900 --> 02:49:48,140
night is my show, Pump Up the Volume, starts at 7 o'clock this morning.

2199
02:49:48,140 --> 02:49:51,140
I'm going to cut you off real fast because we just got a call on the Skyplane.

2200
02:49:51,140 --> 02:49:52,140
No.

2201
02:49:52,140 --> 02:49:53,140
Too bad!

2202
02:49:53,140 --> 02:49:55,140
We'll finish your plug, then we'll go to the Skyplane.

2203
02:49:55,140 --> 02:49:56,140
Never mind, I'm done.

2204
02:49:56,140 --> 02:49:57,140
Fine.

2205
02:49:57,140 --> 02:49:58,140
Alright.

2206
02:49:58,140 --> 02:49:59,140
Hi!

2207
02:49:59,140 --> 02:50:00,140
You're on Orange Lawn's radio.

2208
02:50:00,140 --> 02:50:01,140
Who's this?

2209
02:50:01,140 --> 02:50:02,140
Hey, what's up?

2210
02:50:02,140 --> 02:50:03,140
It's Sherlock.

2211
02:50:03,140 --> 02:50:04,140
Hi, Sherlock.

2212
02:50:04,140 --> 02:50:05,140
How are you?

2213
02:50:05,140 --> 02:50:06,140
Cat!

2214
02:50:06,140 --> 02:50:07,140
How you doing tonight?

2215
02:50:07,140 --> 02:50:08,140
Cat.

2216
02:50:08,140 --> 02:50:09,140
We are good.

2217
02:50:09,140 --> 02:50:11,140
We're pressed for time, but we're doing pretty well, all things considered.

2218
02:50:11,140 --> 02:50:14,140
What's on your mind, Sherlock?

2219
02:50:14,140 --> 02:50:17,760
I don't like the other two

2220
02:50:17,760 --> 02:50:23,080
all is probably the winner here. Really? Now, see, I have a feeling that they're going to

2221
02:50:23,080 --> 02:50:28,160
go for the funny one. Uh, no, no, I just don't like it. Was it not funny to you, or what

2222
02:50:28,160 --> 02:50:34,040
was up with it? No, I'm annoyed by German techno. It's just that amusing. Aren't we

2223
02:50:34,040 --> 02:50:38,840
all? Wouldn't the world be a better place? The only German songs we should be listening

2224
02:50:38,840 --> 02:50:44,640
to should be by Rammstein. Stay in Germany, alright? Let it stay there. Wasn't Erotic

2225
02:50:44,640 --> 02:50:51,640
from Germany? I think so. Enough said. Exactly! That's probably the only song you've heard

2226
02:50:51,640 --> 02:50:55,520
from... No, because when I first considered Eurodance, the last time I checked, Germany

2227
02:50:55,520 --> 02:51:05,380
wasn't in Europe. Germany's not in Europe? Okay, anyway. Did you have a question for

2228
02:51:05,380 --> 02:51:09,160
any of our guests that are here tonight? We've got Iguana Girl, and hey, you know, you're

2229
02:51:09,160 --> 02:51:14,160
a mod over on The Freak, right? Yeah, I am. Alright, how is it working for Iguana Girl?

2230
02:51:14,160 --> 02:51:16,160
She just carry an iron fist or what?

2231
02:51:17,160 --> 02:51:19,160
Yeah, she keeps an iron fist pretty well.

2232
02:51:19,160 --> 02:51:20,660
She keeps check on me all the time.

2233
02:51:20,660 --> 02:51:22,160
I know she's got an iron bra.

2234
02:51:23,160 --> 02:51:27,160
Hopefully you haven't had to deal with that yet, though.

2235
02:51:27,160 --> 02:51:29,160
I didn't want to know that.

2236
02:51:29,160 --> 02:51:31,160
Was it made in Taiwan?

2237
02:51:31,160 --> 02:51:33,160
No, it was made in Taiwan.

2238
02:51:33,160 --> 02:51:35,160
Here comes Iguana Girl on the keyboard.

2239
02:51:35,160 --> 02:51:36,160
Uh oh.

2240
02:51:36,160 --> 02:51:39,160
I think she's going to post a link to the iron bra.

2241
02:51:39,160 --> 02:51:42,160
If you haven't seen this Sherlock, you've got to check it out. It's amazing.

2242
02:51:42,160 --> 02:51:43,760
oh god

2243
02:51:43,760 --> 02:51:45,720
i don't know if i want to see this

2244
02:51:45,720 --> 02:51:46,880
it's pretty funny

2245
02:51:46,880 --> 02:51:49,660
all right i think we got in all the votes for cage match if you don't mind

2246
02:51:49,660 --> 02:51:52,180
shirok i'm gonna sidetrack for a little bit here

2247
02:51:52,180 --> 02:51:56,380
and i'm going to announce the winner of tonight's cage match you guys ready

2248
02:51:56,380 --> 02:51:58,880
first of all what do you guys think won

2249
02:51:58,880 --> 02:52:01,340
out of all those songs

2250
02:52:01,340 --> 02:52:04,560
you're fucking ruining america god damn you people

2251
02:52:04,560 --> 02:52:10,560
all right let's see here we go tonight's winner is

2252
02:52:10,560 --> 02:52:20,120
With electronic supersonic, sorry Sherlock. The tribe has spoken. With almost, get this,

2253
02:52:20,120 --> 02:52:27,220
get this Sherlock, twice as many votes as songs one and two combined.

2254
02:52:27,220 --> 02:52:33,480
You people smoke crack, I swear. Well, what can we say, I already told you

2255
02:52:33,480 --> 02:52:38,920
we were the bastardist, cancerous sub-community here and that vote speaks for itself.

2256
02:52:38,920 --> 02:52:49,480
yeah yeah it seems like it. Did you get a link to the picture there? Yeah I did. I'd

2257
02:52:49,480 --> 02:52:53,800
rather not look at it again. Let me look, I want to see if it actually works or not.

2258
02:52:53,800 --> 02:52:57,840
If you're in our chat room there over at orangehonestradio.com click on chat. There it is. There's a guana

2259
02:52:57,840 --> 02:53:07,040
girl with the lovely white face and the iron bra. Amazing. That's great. Alright, anything

2260
02:53:07,040 --> 02:53:13,520
Anything else you want to state on your 15 seconds of fame here, Sherlock?

2261
02:53:13,520 --> 02:53:17,280
I'd say something, but then the guanagro probably hate me for it, so I'm just going to...

2262
02:53:17,280 --> 02:53:21,080
Oh, now we definitely want to hear it.

2263
02:53:21,080 --> 02:53:23,520
Let me guess, the internet is serious business, guys?

2264
02:53:23,520 --> 02:53:27,000
Yes, the internet is very serious business.

2265
02:53:27,000 --> 02:53:28,000
That's what I tell everyone.

2266
02:53:28,000 --> 02:53:30,040
Why does that say Sherlock, the guanagro?

2267
02:53:30,040 --> 02:53:33,160
Okay, I'm going to do a nice little shot on the camera right for you.

2268
02:53:33,160 --> 02:53:34,160
Okay, Chris?

2269
02:53:34,160 --> 02:53:35,160
Yeah.

2270
02:53:35,160 --> 02:53:38,640
Oh, she just banked her bottom!

2271
02:53:38,640 --> 02:53:41,800
Oh!

2272
02:53:41,800 --> 02:53:46,640
Wow. It's only when Sherlock calls in do we get the bondage coming out on this show.

2273
02:53:46,640 --> 02:53:50,840
I guess we'll have to call in more often then, alright?

2274
02:53:50,840 --> 02:53:53,880
Are you coming to E3 next year, Sherlock?

2275
02:53:53,880 --> 02:53:57,480
I'm hoping so, yeah. I'll be there.

2276
02:53:57,480 --> 02:54:01,360
Yeah, yeah, she's gonna attack me.

2277
02:54:01,360 --> 02:54:04,720
I talk about Mod of the Month when I'm not supposed to.

2278
02:54:04,720 --> 02:54:06,720
And then she hates me for it.

2279
02:54:34,720 --> 02:54:41,280
All right, well that was fun. I like hearing from new people once in a while, so that's

2280
02:54:41,280 --> 02:54:46,560
good. All right, we've got to, got to, got to get to the FUs of the week. If you already

2281
02:54:46,560 --> 02:54:52,640
sent me your FU of the week, I had to close it on accident because of the cage match voting.

2282
02:54:52,640 --> 02:54:57,080
So you want to get those back into me right now. In the meantime, we're going to limit

2283
02:54:57,080 --> 02:55:04,100
it. Sadly enough, we do have to limit it to one FU a person tonight. So Jamie, why do

2284
02:55:04,100 --> 02:55:07,900
we have to do the FUs of the week every single week even when we have no time whatsoever

2285
02:55:07,900 --> 02:55:08,900
for it.

2286
02:55:08,900 --> 02:55:09,900
Anger.

2287
02:55:09,900 --> 02:55:10,900
All this is bad.

2288
02:55:10,900 --> 02:55:11,900
Here is justice.

2289
02:55:11,900 --> 02:55:12,900
Here is punishment.

2290
02:55:12,900 --> 02:55:13,900
Here is...

2291
02:55:13,900 --> 02:55:14,900
This is fucked up.

2292
02:55:14,900 --> 02:55:33,900
A big, massive, humongous FU to the cost of plane tickets into Gulfport, Mississippi.

2293
02:55:33,900 --> 02:55:40,300
I couldn't find one into Mobile for less than $800, and I couldn't find one into Gulfport

2294
02:55:40,300 --> 02:55:42,980
for less than $500 at the time I needed to leave.

2295
02:55:42,980 --> 02:55:48,260
Yeah, I was on Travelocity trying to pick my time, and I found one into New Orleans,

2296
02:55:48,260 --> 02:55:51,140
so that means that my family's going to have to drive an extra hour and a half to come

2297
02:55:51,140 --> 02:55:56,140
get me, but at least I get to leave New Orleans at five in the afternoon, which means that

2298
02:55:56,140 --> 02:55:58,860
I get to enjoy the French Quarter during the day.

2299
02:55:58,860 --> 02:55:59,860
What?

2300
02:55:59,860 --> 02:56:00,860
But it's ridiculous.

2301
02:56:00,860 --> 02:56:01,860
It's ridiculous!

2302
02:56:01,860 --> 02:56:04,860
That does blood. Totally ridiculous.

2303
02:56:04,860 --> 02:56:09,860
Alright, moving on. Here we go. Uh, Loki.

2304
02:56:10,860 --> 02:56:17,860
Lucky to my car and mainly Ford because they make shoddy cars and my car is falling apart and I don't know why.

2305
02:56:17,860 --> 02:56:27,860
I just bought it like what, six months ago? Used, granted, but it only has like only like 30 some odd, you know, thousand miles on it.

2306
02:56:27,860 --> 02:56:32,860
and already the brake system I think is going out, or the front part is going out, and guess what?

2307
02:56:32,860 --> 02:56:35,860
Oh, they have a class action lawsuit for that kind of stuff!

2308
02:56:35,860 --> 02:56:38,860
Shoddy brakes! Yay! Guess what?

2309
02:56:38,860 --> 02:56:44,860
But lucky for me, I was smart and bought the extended warranty, so it will only cost me $50 to fix.

2310
02:56:44,860 --> 02:56:46,860
Whatever the fuck's wrong.

2311
02:56:46,860 --> 02:56:47,860
So...

2312
02:56:47,860 --> 02:56:48,860
Ha!

2313
02:56:48,860 --> 02:56:51,860
But that's my guess right now.

2314
02:56:51,860 --> 02:56:55,860
Whether or not they fucking try to screw me out of that, that's another story.

2315
02:56:55,860 --> 02:57:02,860
next week

2316
02:57:04,300 --> 02:57:07,300
my a few this week goes out to spread pcs

2317
02:57:07,300 --> 02:57:10,780
because i went over there today to get a brand new cell phone and found out

2318
02:57:10,780 --> 02:57:13,900
they have shipped for deals right now i figured you know i'd be able to get a

2319
02:57:13,900 --> 02:57:15,100
good deal because

2320
02:57:15,100 --> 02:57:18,140
i'm out and not under contract with them right now but other deals are pretty

2321
02:57:18,140 --> 02:57:20,860
shitty in fact the salesman excellent salesman

2322
02:57:20,860 --> 02:57:23,220
told me to come back later because they'll probably be getting better

2323
02:57:23,220 --> 02:57:28,420
deals around Christmas time. Fuck you guys, I swear to God, I'm going over to T-Mobile

2324
02:57:28,420 --> 02:57:32,980
where I can have a cell phone that Catherine Zeta-Jones endorses.

2325
02:57:32,980 --> 02:57:33,980
Iguana Girl?

2326
02:57:33,980 --> 02:57:40,300
I'm going to be generic on this one because it kind of encompasses a couple of different

2327
02:57:40,300 --> 02:57:46,540
sections, but a giant F you to people who can't seem to understand that when you're

2328
02:57:46,540 --> 02:57:53,000
band you're fucking banned you're not supposed to come back and if you do come

2329
02:57:53,000 --> 02:57:59,740
back don't whine and bitch and moan about the fact that you're the man I'm

2330
02:57:59,740 --> 02:58:03,380
gonna give you I'm gonna give you some advice I I realize you know I I realize

2331
02:58:03,380 --> 02:58:05,680
that I don't have to do any banning or anything like that so I'm gonna deal

2332
02:58:05,680 --> 02:58:08,060
with the same bullshit you do but this is how I deal with it here on orange

2333
02:58:08,060 --> 02:58:10,260
lounge okay you just gotta look them right in the eye

2334
02:58:10,260 --> 02:58:12,260
FIRED!

2335
02:58:12,260 --> 02:58:13,260
That's what you gotta do.

2336
02:58:13,260 --> 02:58:19,260
But there are those people out there that are banned from the show, like, years ago, and they still keep-

2337
02:58:19,260 --> 02:58:22,260
Yes, we have banned some people, I forgot.

2338
02:58:22,260 --> 02:58:34,260
But, yeah, I'm really, really tired of people who think that they're being cute, and make threats on certain other websites that they're going to attack certain websites,

2339
02:58:34,260 --> 02:58:38,260
And don't think that we're not going to catch wind fission.

2340
02:58:38,260 --> 02:58:41,260
Giant f-you to those dumb shits.

2341
02:58:41,260 --> 02:58:43,260
I want to close watching you. Be good.

2342
02:58:43,260 --> 02:58:45,260
Islander.

2343
02:58:45,260 --> 02:58:46,260
I have none.

2344
02:58:46,260 --> 02:58:50,260
Nothing? F-you to that, Islander.

2345
02:58:50,260 --> 02:58:52,260
That's alright. No. He's...

2346
02:58:52,260 --> 02:58:54,260
You know, Islander's just a nice guy, honestly.

2347
02:58:54,260 --> 02:58:57,260
If you have a chance to meet him in real life, he's honestly the nicest guy.

2348
02:58:57,260 --> 02:58:59,260
A wonderful contrast to me.

2349
02:58:59,260 --> 02:59:03,740
And I do know why we work.

2350
02:59:03,740 --> 02:59:04,740
I see.

2351
02:59:04,740 --> 02:59:05,740
Okay.

2352
02:59:05,740 --> 02:59:06,740
Makes sense.

2353
02:59:06,740 --> 02:59:07,740
Uh, Navi?

2354
02:59:07,740 --> 02:59:08,740
I actually have an F.U.

2355
02:59:08,740 --> 02:59:09,740
Whoo!

2356
02:59:09,740 --> 02:59:10,740
Alright, what is it?

2357
02:59:10,740 --> 02:59:13,420
Um, F.U. to people who stop talking to you for like three months, call you back because

2358
02:59:13,420 --> 02:59:17,940
they miss you, make plans, and then flake out on you, and disappear again!

2359
02:59:17,940 --> 02:59:18,940
Yeah.

2360
02:59:18,940 --> 02:59:19,940
Wonderful world.

2361
02:59:19,940 --> 02:59:25,220
Oh yes, and then her, in reference to her band thing, I got banned.

2362
02:59:25,220 --> 02:59:26,520
I don't know how.

2363
02:59:26,520 --> 02:59:34,300
I had a link to some sim files or something. I checked back on it periodically. It kept

2364
02:59:34,300 --> 02:59:39,440
showing up, you know, you can't load the page. Then the other day, it says, you are banned!

2365
02:59:39,440 --> 02:59:46,280
From what? Freak or where? No, it was some guy who posted his key-sounded 2DX BMS files,

2366
02:59:46,280 --> 02:59:50,960
and it was in his signature. I got some of those a long time ago, and he only allowed

2367
02:59:50,960 --> 02:59:54,120
two people on there at once. I remembered that. I checked again like the other night,

2368
02:59:54,120 --> 03:00:05,560
it says I'm banned. I'm off. That's odd. That's that. Arcadian. Fuck you to lies. Ooh, ouch.

2369
03:00:05,560 --> 03:00:12,040
All right. Let's check out what the chat room has to say. Start off with Zaku. F you. Oh

2370
03:00:12,040 --> 03:00:17,040
boy, here we go. It's political. Brace yourselves. F you to the Jesus-loving, gun-loving, red

2371
03:00:17,040 --> 03:00:20,840
state voters for electing that no good excuse of a chimp of a President George W. Bush to

2372
03:00:20,840 --> 03:00:26,720
second term in the words of a great pump it up song lasenka save us that was

2373
03:00:26,720 --> 03:00:34,480
awfully punny right Chan but to you to being one of the many that sick oh I

2374
03:00:34,480 --> 03:00:38,720
think I think she's saying fuck you to herself for being sick I'm not sure and

2375
03:00:38,720 --> 03:00:45,640
it's that somehow I jazz says f you to procrastination ah

2376
03:00:45,640 --> 03:00:55,400
Poto says F you to laggy towns in MMOs MPQ says F you to the arcade for being

2377
03:00:55,400 --> 03:01:01,920
closed the day I went there black devil or X says F you to those Asian files on

2378
03:01:01,920 --> 03:01:10,040
the DDR freak forums those guys pissed me off well any comment on that and one

2379
03:01:10,040 --> 03:01:15,040
I'm sorry I cannot control the content of the idiot's pose. Sorry.

2380
03:01:15,040 --> 03:01:17,040
I figured while you're here I would let you say something.

2381
03:01:17,040 --> 03:01:18,040
Oh my god.

2382
03:01:18,040 --> 03:01:19,040
Alright.

2383
03:01:19,040 --> 03:01:20,040
L. Mullet says,

2384
03:01:20,040 --> 03:01:26,040
F you to Halo 2 and a type the game will never live up to.

2385
03:01:26,040 --> 03:01:30,040
Blue using Halo 2, that's all that matters.

2386
03:01:30,040 --> 03:01:31,040
And lastly,

2387
03:01:31,040 --> 03:01:32,040
DDR Angel says,

2388
03:01:32,040 --> 03:01:36,040
F you to my video card for suddenly not liking Final Fantasy XI again.

2389
03:01:36,040 --> 03:01:37,040
I wondered why I hadn't seen her on.

2390
03:01:37,040 --> 03:01:39,040
Grr, no Final Fantasy XI for me.

2391
03:01:39,040 --> 03:01:44,400

2394
03:01:55,980 --> 03:01:59,680
segment and you know what guys we're like over time here so we got to wrap up

2395
03:01:59,680 --> 03:02:03,200
the show and I feel real bad now that we didn't get to talk more to you about

2396
03:02:03,200 --> 03:02:07,160
pop music and DDR yeah and you just you know sometime you'll just all the other

2397
03:02:07,160 --> 03:02:11,120
people out there will have to find the damn list for the, you know, the 2DX Visual Emotion

2398
03:02:11,120 --> 03:02:14,480
DVD and V-Rares and all that stuff to find out how great they actually are.

2399
03:02:14,480 --> 03:02:17,180
You know what, November's just a busy month and we'll have to carry over some stuff to

2400
03:02:17,180 --> 03:02:19,920
next week. You know you're welcome back here any time, all you guys are.

2401
03:02:19,920 --> 03:02:23,640
Yeah, as long as I'm willing to drive here. Yeah, it is a little ways, I agree. It's kind

2403
03:02:28,040 --> 03:02:33,080
Girl and Islander. Hope you had a good time. Come back sometime. And, you know, good luck

2404
03:03:03,080 --> 03:03:08,080
Alright, um, now's the part of the show where we go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

2405
03:03:08,080 --> 03:03:10,080
Just like Jerry Springer, we go around and get all the final thoughts.

2406
03:03:10,080 --> 03:03:12,080
Navi, your final thought for tonight?

2407
03:03:12,080 --> 03:03:14,080
I've run out of walls.

2408
03:03:14,080 --> 03:03:18,080
Uh, Aquana Girl, your final thought for tonight?

2409
03:03:18,080 --> 03:03:20,080
Butt plugs in socket.

2410
03:03:20,080 --> 03:03:24,080
Islander, your final thought for tonight?

2411
03:03:24,080 --> 03:03:26,080
Eat, drink, and be merry.

2412
03:03:26,080 --> 03:03:29,080
Very nice. Arcadian, your final thought for tonight?

2413
03:03:29,080 --> 03:03:31,080
Say I'm bad.

2414
03:03:31,080 --> 03:03:36,080
You see, I'm bad. You don't know the half of it! Ha ha ha! Or maybe not.

2415
03:03:36,080 --> 03:03:38,080
No, can't have that.

2416
03:03:38,080 --> 03:03:40,080
Loki, your final thought?

2417
03:03:40,080 --> 03:03:45,080
I have the device done, now to haunt the house.

2418
03:03:45,080 --> 03:03:48,080
Jamie, quick! Jamie, quick! Your final thought?

2419
03:03:48,080 --> 03:03:54,080
I'll go. I'll go with mine. My final thought is, um, Outside the Box moves to Thursday this week, so please don't forget to listen, and fuck-

2420
03:03:54,080 --> 03:03:57,080
Fuck Survivor and fuck The Apprentice!

2421
03:03:57,080 --> 03:03:59,080
Please do something about that nice food, don't forget.

2422
03:03:59,080 --> 03:04:03,640
I will. I know, I know, for once I'm saying fuck survivor, it's funny, but anyway, you

2423
03:04:03,640 --> 03:04:07,240
just, you gotta listen, so, sorry. Uh, DarkSacker, your final thought?

2424
03:04:07,240 --> 03:04:16,240
I have clean clothes, they smell like gain. Lovely. Uh, one last thing, the final word

2425
03:04:16,240 --> 03:04:21,120
of the show, one word that sums it all up, we'll give it to Iguana Girl tonight. Tonight's

2426
03:04:21,120 --> 03:04:24,040
final word, thank you very much everybody for listening, have a great night, we'll see

2427
03:04:24,040 --> 03:04:28,000
you next week, where we're gonna interview Conception and talk all much more about all

2428
03:04:28,000 --> 03:04:35,000
these bimani stuff. Final word. Boobies.

2429
03:04:58,000 --> 03:05:03,000
C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C

2430
03:05:28,000 --> 03:05:30,500
It was December 24th when Hollis Evans had docked

2431
03:05:30,500 --> 03:05:33,000
When I see the man chillin' with his dog at the park

2432
03:05:33,000 --> 03:05:35,500
I'd approach him very slowly with my heart full of fear

2433
03:05:35,500 --> 03:05:38,500
Looked at his dog, oh my God, it all rained there

2434
03:05:38,500 --> 03:05:40,500
But then I was feelin' cool, the man had a beard

2435
03:05:40,500 --> 03:05:43,000
Had a bag full of city 12 o'clock at night

2436
03:05:43,000 --> 03:05:45,500
So I turned my head a second and the man was gone

2437
03:05:45,500 --> 03:05:48,500
But he must've strapped his wildin' back down on the lawn

2438
03:05:48,500 --> 03:05:50,500
I picked the wallet up and then I took a pause

2439
03:05:50,500 --> 03:05:53,500
Took out the license and it costed Santa Claus

2440
03:05:53,500 --> 03:05:56,000
A million dollars in the cold, hundreds of G's

2441
03:05:56,000 --> 03:05:58,400
enough to buy a Bowie Magic Claw and eat

2442
03:05:58,400 --> 03:06:00,800
But I never filled the Santa, so that ain't right

2443
03:06:00,800 --> 03:06:03,200
So I was going home to matter back to him that night

2444
03:06:03,200 --> 03:06:04,800
But when I got home, I thought,

2445
03:06:04,800 --> 03:06:07,200
Cuz under the tree was a letter from Santa

2446
03:06:07,200 --> 03:06:08,800
And the door was to me

2447
03:06:18,400 --> 03:06:21,200
It's Christmas time in Hollis, Queens

2448
03:06:21,200 --> 03:06:23,600
Mom's cooking chicken in collard greens

2449
03:06:23,600 --> 03:06:26,100
Rice and stuff and macaroni and cheese

2450
03:06:26,100 --> 03:06:28,600
And Santa put gifts under Christmas trees

2451
03:06:28,600 --> 03:06:31,100
Decorate the house with lights at night

2452
03:06:31,100 --> 03:06:33,600
Snow's on the ground, Snow White's so bright

2453
03:06:33,600 --> 03:06:36,100
In the fireplace is the Yule log

2454
03:06:36,100 --> 03:06:38,600
Beneath the mistletoe, every drink eggnog

2455
03:06:38,600 --> 03:06:41,100
The rhymes that you hear are the rhymes of Jarrell

2456
03:06:41,100 --> 03:06:45,100
But each and every year we bust Christmas Carols

2457
03:06:59,100 --> 03:07:02,100
Rhyme so loud and proud to hear it's Christmas time

2458
03:07:02,100 --> 03:07:05,100
That we've got the spirit, jacks for chili

2459
03:07:05,100 --> 03:07:09,100
The Hawk is out, and that's what Christmas is all about

2460
03:07:09,100 --> 03:07:14,100
The time is now, the place is here And the whole wide world is filled with cheer

2461
03:07:14,100 --> 03:07:19,100
My name is MC with the mic in my hand And I'm chillin' and coolin' just like a snowman

2462
03:07:19,100 --> 03:07:25,100
So open your eyes, lend us a ear We wanna say Merry Christmas and Happy New Year

2463
03:07:49,100 --> 03:08:16,940
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

2464
03:08:16,940 --> 03:08:21,100
Orange Lounge Radio Afterbirth, the part after we fade to black. Hopefully you guys know

2465
03:08:21,100 --> 03:08:25,340
to stick around because there's always something fun after the credits. Tonight, my God, we

2466
03:08:25,340 --> 03:08:29,560
are so pooped though. I mean, it's just been a hell of a show. What a way to come back

2467
03:08:29,560 --> 03:08:35,440
after not being here. I do, I need to talk about ratings though. I need to talk about

2468
03:08:35,440 --> 03:08:42,940
ratings for the station. Ratings, what? Ratings for the station have fallen 20% in the past

2469
03:08:42,940 --> 03:08:45,260
two weeks

2470
03:08:45,260 --> 03:08:47,860
I am quite disappointed in you guys, that's alright

2471
03:08:47,860 --> 03:08:49,060
but here's your chance

2472
03:08:49,060 --> 03:08:50,940
go in your little player window right now

2473
03:08:50,940 --> 03:08:54,080
vote us a five that you love this station, you want to listen to it every day

2474
03:08:54,080 --> 03:08:54,980
and then do so

2475
03:08:54,980 --> 03:08:58,820
and help our ratings get back up. Now we realize, okay, we were off for a week, we

2476
03:08:58,820 --> 03:09:00,760
had some repeats in there

2477
03:09:00,760 --> 03:09:03,100
and you know we, you know, had

2478
03:09:03,100 --> 03:09:04,780
had some shows, switch days and stuff

2479
03:09:04,780 --> 03:09:06,340
no more excuses, we're done

2480
03:09:06,340 --> 03:09:09,920
okay so you gotta whore us up so that you know we can be the number one internet

2481
03:09:09,920 --> 03:09:31,360
radio station of all time. That is the ultimate goal.

2482
03:09:31,360 --> 03:09:36,960
Anyway, I also want to talk quickly about The Incredibles, that movie, because I'm surprised

2483
03:09:36,960 --> 03:09:41,840
you didn't say much about it, Loki. What did you think of the movie?

2484
03:09:41,840 --> 03:09:48,240
It is what all superhero movies should aspire to. It's actually, it's very misleading, like

2485
03:09:48,240 --> 03:09:52,640
anyone that's like, you know, seen the previous, because they think, oh, it's a kid's movie,

2486
03:09:52,640 --> 03:09:57,800
oh, this and that, but actually it has a story that I would say is on par if not better than

2487
03:09:57,800 --> 03:10:00,600
a lot of the animated superman and

2488
03:10:00,600 --> 03:10:03,500
uh... batman series and we know that those are awesome

2489
03:10:03,500 --> 03:10:05,520
uh... writers on the series

2490
03:10:05,520 --> 03:10:08,960
of course you mean the guys that coming wrote the whole damn thing you know the

2491
03:10:08,960 --> 03:10:11,800
guy behind you know what in uh...

2492
03:10:11,800 --> 03:10:14,760
the iron giant i mean that would be was incredible

2493
03:10:14,760 --> 03:10:16,960
this movie is

2494
03:10:16,960 --> 03:10:19,140
set design uh...

2495
03:10:19,140 --> 03:10:20,720
the character development

2496
03:10:20,720 --> 03:10:22,660
everything is just

2497
03:10:22,660 --> 03:10:24,400
you need to see this movie

2498
03:10:24,400 --> 03:10:26,640
and i cannot stress enough is

2499
03:10:26,640 --> 03:10:29,780
awesome i cannot wait for a sequel

2500
03:10:29,780 --> 03:10:32,480
this is like pixar at a whole new level

2501
03:10:32,480 --> 03:10:34,900
and what's great though is it is for kids

2502
03:10:34,900 --> 03:10:36,620
but it is a little bit more adult

2503
03:10:36,620 --> 03:10:41,480
than some of the other kids movies. It's PG, there is like violence in it

2504
03:10:41,480 --> 03:10:42,700
and stuff

2505
03:10:42,700 --> 03:10:44,200
and there's like you know

2506
03:10:44,200 --> 03:10:51,200
it's just great. The characters were awesome. That's all I have to say. I mean, it was just incredible.

2507
03:10:52,100 --> 03:10:55,400
You know, I thought the movie was fun. It was really entertaining. I don't know about like

2508
03:10:55,400 --> 03:10:58,420
the best movie of all time and stuff like that. I don't know if it was even the best

2509
03:10:58,420 --> 03:11:01,960
movie of the year for me personally, but it was a really fun time, and if I had kids I'd

2510
03:11:01,960 --> 03:11:05,120
take them to see it because I thought it was a good movie, and just really well animated.

2511
03:11:05,120 --> 03:11:08,440
I was sitting there during the whole time going, this would make a really cute video

2512
03:11:08,440 --> 03:11:11,680
game, and in fact they do have a video game for it, and I was actually kind of curious

2513
03:11:11,680 --> 03:11:15,080
to check it out. I kind of think, oh, it might be a fun video game. We'll see. Did you see

2514
03:11:15,080 --> 03:11:20,440
this movie yet, Navi, at all? I have not. The last movie I saw was The Grudge. What

2515
03:11:20,440 --> 03:11:24,480
did you think of that? I liked it a lot. A lot of people that have seen it either said

2516
03:11:24,480 --> 03:11:27,120
they liked it and thought it was really scary, and then other people said that movie had

2517
03:11:27,120 --> 03:11:32,080
absolutely no substance whatsoever, it was crap. I liked it, I thought it, I mean, it

2518
03:11:32,080 --> 03:11:36,820
was more something like, wow, it was actually a scary movie. We don't see very many scary

2519
03:11:36,820 --> 03:11:39,560
movies very often anymore, at least that's what I thought.

2520
03:11:39,560 --> 03:11:44,200
Yeah, for the record, I did not get to see the Star Wars 3 trailer when I saw The Incredibles,

2521
03:11:44,200 --> 03:11:47,680
just for whoever asked. I don't really care, I'm not like the hugest Star Wars fan in the

2522
03:11:47,680 --> 03:11:53,380
world, I mean, you know, hooray, the movie's coming out, but, you know, I'll be okay. Anyway,

2523
03:11:53,380 --> 03:11:56,300
I like the grudge as well, except for the audience I saw it with.

2524
03:11:56,300 --> 03:11:58,300
Yeah, you should have been in the moment.

2525
03:11:58,300 --> 03:12:00,300
You should, like, compare audiences later.

2526
03:12:00,300 --> 03:12:01,300
Seriously.

2527
03:12:01,300 --> 03:12:02,300
Alright.

2528
03:12:02,300 --> 03:12:04,980
Well, okay, that's going to do it for the Afterbirth, you guys.

2529
03:12:04,980 --> 03:12:05,980
We've got to take off.

2530
03:12:05,980 --> 03:12:10,820
Jamie's got to get home, and I got tests to grade and stuff like that, so thank you guys

2531
03:12:10,820 --> 03:12:12,180
for listening, though, so much.

2532
03:12:12,180 --> 03:12:15,460
We really do appreciate the fact that you guys support this station through our high

2533
03:12:15,460 --> 03:12:17,020
points and our low points.

2534
03:12:17,020 --> 03:12:19,580
We are working on so many exciting things for you guys.

2535
03:12:19,580 --> 03:12:21,340
We're teaming up with Spot.

2536
03:12:21,340 --> 03:12:23,220
We're teaming up with Freak.

2537
03:12:23,220 --> 03:12:28,520
amazing, the stuff that's in the future for us. And, you know, I just, I really thank

2538
03:12:28,520 --> 03:12:31,480
you guys who have supported us, especially those from day one, but we definitely welcome

2539
03:12:31,480 --> 03:12:37,960
all you guys to hop on board as the show goes on. It's just amazing. It's amazing. I don't

2540
03:12:37,960 --> 03:12:42,240
think it's on, Jane. Remember, do it for the ferrets. They love you too. Let's hear a little

2541
03:12:42,240 --> 03:12:49,240
ferret love there. Get a little ferret love. Even, you know what, Loki, we don't get enough,

2542
03:12:49,240 --> 03:12:54,280
we don't get enough love out of Loki on this show. Loki, will you please let the listeners

2543
03:12:54,280 --> 03:13:04,000
know how much you love them? Uh, no. Ass. Alright, enjoy the post-show tonight. You

2544
03:13:04,000 --> 03:13:06,600
guys can probably figure this one out. We definitely have to load you down with some

2545
03:13:06,600 --> 03:13:13,360
2DX Red music. So, enjoy, have a great night, and we'll see you tomorrow night for Diversion

2546
03:13:13,360 --> 03:13:20,360
7 o'clock for Mani remixes. Have a great night guys!

2547
03:13:43,360 --> 03:13:47,360
In the frame, leggin' through the guards away from me

2548
03:13:47,360 --> 03:13:50,360
That's my young life, it's on the road

2549
03:13:50,360 --> 03:13:54,360
Everybody's lookin', who wants to sing for me?

2550
03:13:54,360 --> 03:13:57,360
Runnin' up the stairs with my gun

2551
03:13:57,360 --> 03:14:00,360
Tomorrow is the last chance for everyone to sing

2552
03:14:00,360 --> 03:14:02,360
I'm not done yet

2553
03:14:02,360 --> 03:14:05,360
Real life's done, I'm done, I'm done, I'm done

2554
03:14:05,360 --> 03:14:08,360
Let's set the tone, we can set the scene

2555
03:14:08,360 --> 03:14:10,360
Make it loud baby, hit the lights and fire

2556
03:14:10,360 --> 03:14:12,360
Turn on the lights on fire

2557
03:14:12,360 --> 03:14:15,000
With your mind, I will see the highlight

2558
03:14:15,000 --> 03:14:43,240
So listen, shall we tell the enhanced soldiers, do you know how to carry it?

2559
03:14:43,240 --> 03:14:46,160
And I think I'll be the one that's beating you

2560
03:14:46,160 --> 03:14:47,900
And you can't just light the fire

2561
03:14:47,900 --> 03:14:49,540
We're on the line for fire

2562
03:14:49,540 --> 03:14:52,280
We're your fire, and we're beating higher

2563
03:14:52,280 --> 03:14:55,540
And I think that you're just the one that's beating you

2564
03:16:55,540 --> 03:16:57,540
you

2565
03:17:25,540 --> 03:17:32,540
Be quiet.

2566
03:17:32,540 --> 03:17:39,540
Be quiet.

2567
03:17:39,540 --> 03:17:46,540
Be quiet.

2568
03:17:46,540 --> 03:17:53,540
Be quiet.

2569
03:17:53,540 --> 03:17:55,540
Be quiet

2570
03:17:55,540 --> 03:18:02,540
Be quiet, be quiet, be quiet, be quiet

2571
03:20:25,540 --> 03:20:27,540
I hope you enjoyed the video!

2580

2595
03:26:31,420 --> 03:26:31,920
Yeah

2596
03:28:01,420 --> 03:28:02,420
Hey!

2597
03:28:02,420 --> 03:28:03,420
Hey!

2598
03:28:03,420 --> 03:28:04,420
Hey!

2599
03:28:04,420 --> 03:28:05,420
Hey!

2600
03:28:05,420 --> 03:28:06,420
Hey!

2601
03:30:06,420 --> 03:30:07,420
Hey!

2602
03:30:07,420 --> 03:30:08,420
Hey!

2603
03:30:08,420 --> 03:30:09,420
Hey!

2604
03:30:09,420 --> 03:30:10,420
Hey!

2605
03:30:10,420 --> 03:30:11,420
Hey!

2606
03:30:11,420 --> 03:30:21,420
Hey!

2607
03:30:21,420 --> 03:30:31,420
Hey!

2608
03:30:31,420 --> 03:30:35,420
Hey!

2609
03:30:35,420 --> 03:30:36,420
Hey!

2610
03:30:36,420 --> 03:30:37,420
Hey!

2611
03:30:37,420 --> 03:30:38,420
Hey!

2612
03:30:38,420 --> 03:30:39,420
Hey!

2613
03:30:39,420 --> 03:30:41,420
Hey!

2614
03:30:41,420 --> 03:30:43,420
Hey!

2615

Hey!

2616
03:30:45,420 --> 03:30:47,420
Hey!

2617
03:32:47,420 --> 03:32:55,420
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio. We're live here with this post-show going on of 2DX11 style, also known as 2DX Red music.

2618
03:32:55,420 --> 03:33:03,420
I guess it's taboo to call it 2DX11 style. I'm not supposed to say that. I might get bitch-slapped by some rabid fan.

2619
03:33:03,420 --> 03:33:09,420
But actually, what I'm going to do right now is I'm actually going to do something technical on this end that has to do with the archive of the broadcast.

2620
03:33:09,420 --> 03:33:13,420
The past few weeks we've been having trouble with it, though, and it stopped the station.

2621
03:33:13,420 --> 03:33:18,420
So if you guys get booted from the stream, it's gonna go back to the Bomani music and more program. So just

2622
03:33:18,940 --> 03:33:25,200
Just just restart the stream in like 15 seconds if we disconnect. Okay, I'm gonna try now

2623
03:33:25,200 --> 03:33:28,080
I'm gonna hope we don't though so I can keep going with the 2dx red stuff. Here we go

2624
03:33:28,080 --> 03:33:31,520
Let's see what happens if I lose you guys then good night. Sorry
