97
00:13:22,826 --> 00:13:23,787
[SPEAKER_10]: Can we talk about that?

98
00:13:24,067 --> 00:13:26,429
[SPEAKER_14]: No subject will ever be taboo.

99
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:30,333
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I was thinking maybe we should move Pump Up the Volume from Tuesday Nights.

100
00:13:30,853 --> 00:13:33,396
[SPEAKER_09]: Except, of course, a subject that was just under discussion.

101
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:39,261
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?

102
00:13:39,822 --> 00:13:41,103
[SPEAKER_27]: I collect your fucking head.

103
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:44,555
[SPEAKER_27]: Just like this fucker here.

104
00:13:45,636 --> 00:13:49,317
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki?

105
00:13:49,617 --> 00:13:52,978
[SPEAKER_09]: The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!

106
00:13:53,918 --> 00:14:00,500
[SPEAKER_27]: Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!

00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:18,522
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sure glad I took that lozenge, you know, took care of my voice problem.

110
00:14:18,682 --> 00:14:20,583
[SPEAKER_10]: What's going on with everybody being sick lately?

111
00:14:21,043 --> 00:14:22,824
[SPEAKER_10]: Quick poll in the room, because we have a lot of people here.

112
00:14:23,045 --> 00:14:25,846
[SPEAKER_10]: Who has been sick in the past week, or feeling it a little bit?

113
00:14:26,386 --> 00:14:30,569
[SPEAKER_10]: One, two, three, I thought, didn't you just say you were sick, Navi?

114
00:14:30,849 --> 00:14:31,269
[SPEAKER_10]: As of today.

115
00:14:31,289 --> 00:14:32,170
[SPEAKER_10]: As of this afternoon.

116
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:32,450
[SPEAKER_10]: Four.

117
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:33,010
[SPEAKER_10]: About half.

118
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:33,691
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm a sick club.

119
00:14:34,727 --> 00:14:39,332
[SPEAKER_10]: Half the folks in here are in the sick club right now, so I'm a little worried.

120
00:14:39,372 --> 00:14:42,435
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope we don't catch it, but I think everybody's past contagious stage.

121
00:14:42,935 --> 00:14:45,638
[SPEAKER_10]: If I exhale hard enough, I can make the raspy voice.

122
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:46,980
[SPEAKER_10]: Hot.

123
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,662
[SPEAKER_24]: I've got the rockin' pneumonia and the boogie-woogie flu.

124
00:14:49,682 --> 00:14:50,283
[SPEAKER_24]: Does that count?

125
00:14:51,604 --> 00:14:52,625
[SPEAKER_10]: The boogie-woogie flu?

126
00:14:52,746 --> 00:14:53,346
[SPEAKER_24]: It's a song.

127
00:14:54,307 --> 00:14:54,808
[SPEAKER_24]: You ever heard?

128
00:14:55,685 --> 00:14:57,488
[SPEAKER_24]: I cannot believe you've never heard that song.

129
00:14:58,068 --> 00:15:01,492
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe I have heard it and I just forgot it because it sucked.

130
00:15:01,873 --> 00:15:02,794
[SPEAKER_24]: It doesn't suck.

131
00:15:02,834 --> 00:15:03,315
[SPEAKER_10]: Just kidding.

132
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:06,378
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, if you're just joining us, welcome to the show.

133
00:15:06,398 --> 00:15:08,841

136
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:18,051
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a crowded house.

137
00:15:18,691 --> 00:15:25,537
[SPEAKER_10]: A good way to come back from episode, or I should say a non-episode, not having a show for a week, so it's a good way to come back.

138
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:33,164
[SPEAKER_10]: But we're going to start off tonight's show as we start off every week, this week being no different, and I want to know, how was your week and how was your day?

139
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:36,327
[SPEAKER_10]: And also tonight, a bonus question, how was your Halloween?

140
00:15:37,168 --> 00:15:38,329
[SPEAKER_10]: Jamie, start us off as you always do.

141
00:15:39,671 --> 00:15:50,221
[SPEAKER_24]: My Halloween, well we did the thing at work and I was wearing these fuzzy leg warmers and fuzzy arm warmers and had cat ears and a tail and went around playing with yarn and blah, that was it.

142
00:15:50,622 --> 00:15:58,069
[SPEAKER_24]: We had Rocky though on Saturday night, well technically Sunday morning, Saturday night, and I got to play with lights.

143
00:15:59,090 --> 00:15:59,871
[SPEAKER_24]: Wow, it's

144
00:16:02,071 --> 00:16:06,676
[SPEAKER_24]: No, I just, I didn't, I don't think I had enough time to get used to it, but it was cool.

145
00:16:07,817 --> 00:16:12,041
[SPEAKER_24]: And then Halloween, I was just sort of like, dress up, what's that?

146
00:16:13,283 --> 00:16:15,145
[SPEAKER_24]: And the rest of the week was all busy, busy, busy.

147
00:16:15,685 --> 00:16:18,668
[SPEAKER_24]: And had fun yesterday, hanging out.

148
00:16:19,609 --> 00:16:20,070
[SPEAKER_24]: Lots of fun.

149
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,220
[SPEAKER_24]: So, that was it.

150
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,941
[SPEAKER_24]: I kept this one short because we have a lot of people.

151
00:16:25,021 --> 00:16:25,581
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, wow.

152
00:16:26,301 --> 00:16:26,761
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm shocked.

153
00:16:26,921 --> 00:16:28,561
[SPEAKER_10]: Usually you have like a 15 minute monologue.

154
00:16:28,961 --> 00:16:29,462
[SPEAKER_10]: It's amazing.

155
00:16:29,602 --> 00:16:29,962
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just kidding.

156
00:16:31,022 --> 00:16:32,582
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, FloWalk, how you doing?

157
00:16:32,602 --> 00:16:32,982
[SPEAKER_10]: How was your week?

158
00:16:33,002 --> 00:16:33,382
[SPEAKER_10]: How was your day?

159
00:16:33,402 --> 00:16:33,962
[SPEAKER_10]: How was your Halloween?

160
00:16:34,383 --> 00:16:40,504
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see, Halloween, gosh, I really can't remember much of it because there just really wasn't a bunch of Halloween type stuff going on.

161
00:16:40,544 --> 00:16:44,424
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't get a chance to break out my Lucas from the Wizard costume.

162
00:16:45,225 --> 00:16:46,525
[SPEAKER_12]: Aww, I bet it was so bad.

163
00:16:46,545 --> 00:16:47,045
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

164
00:16:48,172 --> 00:16:48,932
[SPEAKER_01]: Indeed it was.

165
00:16:49,313 --> 00:16:54,255
[SPEAKER_10]: But, uh, let's see, as far as the week goes, gosh, man, I think... I just have to interject, though.

166
00:16:55,055 --> 00:17:00,497
[SPEAKER_10]: You went to Classic Gaming Expo, of course, you were there, and I think most, well, a few people in this room went to Classic Gaming Expo.

167
00:17:01,238 --> 00:17:07,220
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know how many of you guys saw the power glove that was in the room, where they were showing all the old stuff.

168
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:11,562
[SPEAKER_10]: Every time, people would walk by it, like, every other person would go, it's so bad.

169
00:17:12,022 --> 00:17:12,823
[SPEAKER_01]: Myself included.

170
00:17:13,923 --> 00:17:14,764
[SPEAKER_10]: Myself included.

171
00:17:15,804 --> 00:17:16,685
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, sorry to interrupt.

172
00:17:17,345 --> 00:17:18,426
[SPEAKER_01]: It was cool.

173
00:17:18,446 --> 00:17:24,029
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see, as far as the week goes, gosh, I think I probably speak like just everyone else.

174
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:27,431
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably been sucked up in way too many video games to count.

175
00:17:27,931 --> 00:17:30,953
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Katamari's just been giving me eye strain like a mother.

176
00:17:31,373 --> 00:17:37,917
[SPEAKER_01]: Although, for those who have played, I don't know if anyone else has gone a perfect 10 meters on the North Star, but... Alright, nice!

177
00:17:41,564 --> 00:17:48,247
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool, yeah, it took me like about seven tries or so, but once I figured out the pattern, it's like, yeah, cake, and then all that good stuff.

178
00:17:48,687 --> 00:18:05,513
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, let's see, I actually am not working at Konami for the time being, but I did get hired over at the Princeton Review over just this week, so if anyone needs some hookups on SAT cheat sheets, hey, then again, I didn't need that because I got 1440 on mine, so, hey.

179
00:18:05,533 --> 00:18:05,633
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.

180
00:18:08,993 --> 00:18:17,980
[SPEAKER_01]: And then today is just, of course, you know, always making the track up from the South Bay up here and jamming to Sirius Radio, which is like the greatest invention next to the iPod.

181
00:18:18,981 --> 00:18:22,084
[SPEAKER_01]: And here we are now, and it only gets better from here.

182
00:18:22,624 --> 00:18:24,526
[SPEAKER_10]: Is Sirius the one that's getting Howard Stern?

183
00:18:25,046 --> 00:18:25,487
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it is.

184
00:18:26,427 --> 00:18:29,530
[SPEAKER_10]: I was checking out because I need to get my car stereo replaced, and I was kind of thinking about it.

185
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:30,110
[SPEAKER_10]: Think about it.

186
00:18:30,751 --> 00:18:31,091
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

187
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:32,853
[SPEAKER_21]: Sirius went from 600,000 customers to over...

188
00:18:34,983 --> 00:18:37,365
[SPEAKER_21]: just under a million in less than a month on that one announcement alone.

189
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:37,925
[SPEAKER_10]: Figures.

190
00:18:38,245 --> 00:18:39,186
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm one of them.

191
00:18:39,406 --> 00:18:39,947
[SPEAKER_10]: No surprises.

192
00:18:41,648 --> 00:18:48,533
[SPEAKER_10]: It would be my dream one day to get this shit on satellite radio, but yeah, I'm not holding my breath on that one.

193
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:51,849
[SPEAKER_10]: But I did see one of those things at Best Buy.

194
00:18:51,889 --> 00:18:55,210
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like a stereo where you can listen to internet radio like anywhere in your house.

195
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:56,250
[SPEAKER_10]: It looked pretty cool.

196
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:56,950
[SPEAKER_10]: It was $180.

197
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:57,750
[SPEAKER_10]: But it looked pretty cool.

198
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:00,431
[SPEAKER_10]: And hopefully, you know, in about a year, technology comes down.

199
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:01,951
[SPEAKER_10]: So, anyway.

200
00:19:03,211 --> 00:19:03,591
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, hi.

201
00:19:04,011 --> 00:19:05,312
[SPEAKER_10]: Shark Skrill, how was your week?

202
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:05,832
[SPEAKER_10]: How was your day?

203
00:19:05,852 --> 00:19:07,332
[SPEAKER_10]: How was your Halloween?

204
00:19:08,052 --> 00:19:10,092
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't even remember what I did for Halloween, really.

205
00:19:10,793 --> 00:19:11,913
[SPEAKER_21]: Is this thing working or no?

206
00:19:12,053 --> 00:19:12,433
[SPEAKER_10]: It's working.

207
00:19:12,473 --> 00:19:14,353
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to go back and make sure the audio levels are up.

208
00:19:14,393 --> 00:19:14,793
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, cool.

209
00:19:15,213 --> 00:19:17,934
[SPEAKER_21]: But, yeah, I just kind of hung out for Halloween.

210
00:19:17,954 --> 00:19:18,414
[SPEAKER_21]: It was boring.

211
00:19:20,203 --> 00:19:21,083
[SPEAKER_21]: You went shopping today, right?

212
00:19:44,122 --> 00:19:45,363
[SPEAKER_21]: I bought shoes.

213
00:19:45,983 --> 00:19:46,764
[SPEAKER_21]: I was a good girl.

214
00:19:46,804 --> 00:19:47,904
[SPEAKER_21]: I only came back with one pair.

215
00:19:48,525 --> 00:19:51,947
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you one of those girls that has like 100 pairs of shoes in their closet?

216
00:19:51,967 --> 00:19:51,947
20.

217
00:19:52,647 --> 00:19:56,510
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's probably average for a lot of girls I know.

218
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:59,492
[SPEAKER_21]: And the scary thing is I haven't bought any shoes in like two years.

219
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:03,034
[SPEAKER_21]: And then in like the past probably nine months, I've bought like 10 pair.

220
00:20:03,694 --> 00:20:04,675
[SPEAKER_21]: I get them like all the time.

221
00:20:04,695 --> 00:20:06,196
[SPEAKER_21]: People are threatening to call me Imelda.

222
00:20:08,174 --> 00:20:09,395
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I'm not even going to joke with you.

223
00:20:09,895 --> 00:20:16,158
[SPEAKER_10]: One of my best friends in high school, who I used to do my public access show with back in the day, she had 100 pairs of shoes in her closet.

224
00:20:16,238 --> 00:20:16,738
[SPEAKER_16]: Good God.

225
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:19,780
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, there's not enough days in the year to wear all those.

226
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:23,121
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you worn every one of those pairs each one day at least?

227
00:20:23,282 --> 00:20:24,102
[SPEAKER_10]: She's like, I think so.

228
00:20:24,522 --> 00:20:28,944
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, I went through my shoe stash the other day, and I was like, I don't even remember buying these things.

229
00:20:29,004 --> 00:20:29,645
[SPEAKER_21]: What the hell?

230
00:20:29,725 --> 00:20:30,345
[SPEAKER_21]: These are cute.

231
00:20:31,786 --> 00:20:32,306
[SPEAKER_21]: Now I'm wearing them.

232
00:20:33,847 --> 00:20:34,207
[SPEAKER_10]: Very cool.

233
00:20:34,487 --> 00:20:34,827
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

234
00:20:35,227 --> 00:20:36,248
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, let's talk to Islander.

235
00:20:37,349 --> 00:20:38,510
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello, how was your week?

236
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,050
[SPEAKER_02]: How was your day?

237
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:40,671
[SPEAKER_02]: How was your Halloween?

238
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:42,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Week's going by just fine.

239
00:20:42,853 --> 00:20:48,537
[SPEAKER_02]: The only one who's, like, not sick, thanks to this, like, freakishly good immune system.

240
00:20:49,878 --> 00:20:53,320
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, like, no, seriously, like, Jessica, like, just kind of shakes her head.

241
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:59,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, as you can see on camera, she's giving me the finger, because I hardly ever get sick, and I don't know why.

242
00:21:00,165 --> 00:21:00,986
[SPEAKER_16]: It's the RTF genes.

243
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:01,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

244
00:21:02,206 --> 00:21:03,167
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it definitely is.

245
00:21:03,247 --> 00:21:04,168
[SPEAKER_02]: It must be the RTF genes.

246
00:21:06,089 --> 00:21:07,090
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, no, um...

247
00:21:08,049 --> 00:21:11,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Halloween was basically my day to recover from Rocky.

248
00:21:13,871 --> 00:21:17,112
[SPEAKER_02]: And what was really funny was that after dinner, we went and got some food.

249
00:21:17,572 --> 00:21:19,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, not some food, but some candy for the kids.

250
00:21:20,193 --> 00:21:23,014
[SPEAKER_02]: And no kids showed up at all.

251
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:25,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Which was kind of surprising.

252
00:21:26,515 --> 00:21:26,755
[SPEAKER_02]: None.

253
00:21:26,995 --> 00:21:27,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

254
00:21:27,816 --> 00:21:28,876
[SPEAKER_02]: No kids at all.

255
00:21:31,017 --> 00:21:31,657
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.

256
00:21:31,937 --> 00:21:32,717
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what's going on.

257
00:21:33,497 --> 00:21:35,238
[SPEAKER_02]: But other than that, I've been trying...

258
00:21:35,984 --> 00:21:41,685
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been trying to get ready for... I wanted to go to the Madden Challenge for Madden 2005, but that's not happening because I suck.

259
00:21:43,265 --> 00:21:45,246
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've just lately been playing a lot of SmackDown.

260
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:47,026
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty much it, though.

261
00:21:48,226 --> 00:21:52,127
[SPEAKER_10]: Did I tell you one day I saw the Madden 2005 bus broke down on the side of the road?

262
00:21:52,327 --> 00:21:53,067
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you serious?

263
00:21:53,207 --> 00:21:54,027
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty fucking funny.

264
00:21:54,047 --> 00:22:03,709
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, on the 680... On the 680, I was driving down... I think it was one time I was coming to see you one day, SharkScrawlers, driving down 680, and there was the bus broke down on the side of the road.

265
00:22:03,729 --> 00:22:05,109
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, that is hilarious!

266
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:09,291
[SPEAKER_10]: I talked about that like weeks ago on Outside Talks, but yeah, it's crazy.

267
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:09,991
[SPEAKER_10]: Funny.

268
00:22:10,631 --> 00:22:11,771
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, let's move on.

269
00:22:11,971 --> 00:22:13,652
[SPEAKER_10]: And Iguana Girl, welcome back.

270
00:22:14,352 --> 00:22:14,612
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

271
00:22:14,632 --> 00:22:15,252
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been a little while.

272
00:22:15,472 --> 00:22:16,353
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

273
00:22:16,553 --> 00:22:18,873
[SPEAKER_19]: It's been quite a while since you and I have been on a show together.

274
00:22:18,893 --> 00:22:19,373
Wow.

275
00:22:19,593 --> 00:22:21,214
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of like a reunion.

276
00:22:21,434 --> 00:22:22,714
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh my god, oh my god.

277
00:22:22,734 --> 00:22:23,774
[SPEAKER_19]: 2001 all over again.

278
00:22:25,355 --> 00:22:26,855
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm glad we can be candid about it, though.

279
00:22:27,255 --> 00:22:27,555
[SPEAKER_10]: Seriously.

280
00:22:27,635 --> 00:22:28,015
[SPEAKER_10]: It's good.

281
00:22:28,155 --> 00:22:30,036
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, for those that don't know, Iguana Girl and I...

282
00:22:31,584 --> 00:22:33,626
[SPEAKER_10]: Weren't the best of friends the last couple years.

283
00:22:34,867 --> 00:22:36,329
[SPEAKER_19]: To put it lightly, yes.

284
00:22:36,349 --> 00:22:39,812
[SPEAKER_09]: Which, you know, but, you know, time heals things.

285
00:22:39,952 --> 00:22:43,836
[SPEAKER_19]: And we've got a bunch of big balls and we sucked them up.

286
00:22:44,377 --> 00:22:46,139
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you know, we just, you know, kissed and made up.

287
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:46,879
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, without the kissing.

288
00:22:48,732 --> 00:23:02,443
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, but it's worked out good, and, you know, everybody always thought there was this big, like, oh, Orange Lounge versus DDR Freak, because you are the goddess behind DDR Freak Radio, and everybody's always been like, oh, you know, it's, oh, Orange Lounge versus DDR Freak, and not really.

289
00:23:02,463 --> 00:23:06,386
[SPEAKER_24]: We know, I've been sitting here going, uh, don't I do both?

290
00:23:06,446 --> 00:23:06,846
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

291
00:23:07,807 --> 00:23:11,890
[SPEAKER_10]: But no, it's good to have you on, and certainly, if you want to make a plug for DDR Freak Radio, go ahead.

292
00:23:12,171 --> 00:23:13,312
[SPEAKER_10]: Listen to DDR Freak Radio.

293
00:23:13,652 --> 00:23:16,094
[SPEAKER_10]: Because, I think there's...

294
00:23:18,226 --> 00:23:23,550
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there's like... I think there's 90,000 some odd stations on Life 365.

295
00:23:25,663 --> 00:23:26,284
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't checked.

296
00:23:26,344 --> 00:23:34,429
[SPEAKER_10]: There are many more stations that we could pick on besides DDR Freak Radio.

297
00:23:34,589 --> 00:23:43,294
[SPEAKER_10]: For those who don't know, Guanagirl and I used to do a show way back in the day under Sedation Live, which is still on the air.

298
00:23:43,454 --> 00:23:46,816
[SPEAKER_10]: It just doesn't have us on it anymore, but it's got the very lovely... Kind of moved to Texas.

299
00:23:46,996 --> 00:23:48,617
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, the show went and moved to Texas.

300
00:23:48,877 --> 00:23:52,598
[SPEAKER_10]: But it does have the very lovely Jenna, I can't remember her name.

301
00:23:52,618 --> 00:23:54,779
[SPEAKER_19]: Jenna Saunders and Travis Donovan.

302
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:54,999
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

303
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:58,619
[SPEAKER_10]: So they still are on the air, so check them out, understationalive.org.

304
00:23:58,639 --> 00:24:01,800
[SPEAKER_10]: And sometimes you can even hear the old episodes have a Gwana Girl and I on them.

305
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:02,520
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

306
00:24:03,201 --> 00:24:04,481
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're reunited on the air.

307
00:24:04,501 --> 00:24:05,821
[SPEAKER_19]: In our other names, mind you.

308
00:24:07,562 --> 00:24:08,282
[SPEAKER_10]: The real deal names.

309
00:24:08,362 --> 00:24:08,642
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

310
00:24:08,842 --> 00:24:10,322
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, okay, so enough of that.

311
00:24:10,362 --> 00:24:10,783
[SPEAKER_10]: How was your week?

312
00:24:10,803 --> 00:24:11,203
[SPEAKER_10]: How was your day?

313
00:24:11,563 --> 00:24:12,003
[SPEAKER_10]: How was your Halloween?

314
00:24:12,603 --> 00:24:20,265
[SPEAKER_19]: My Halloween was, as most other people in this room, or a good portion of other people in this room, would be spent at Rocky Horror.

315
00:24:21,445 --> 00:24:32,107
[SPEAKER_19]: I played Columbia and got to get all dressed up in all the sequins and do my hair and all that fun jazz and bounce around and hope that my top didn't fall off.

316
00:24:32,788 --> 00:24:37,769
[SPEAKER_19]: And then after that, Halloween, I got Cheat Night.

317
00:24:38,049 --> 00:24:38,829
[SPEAKER_19]: I actually got to have...

318
00:24:40,086 --> 00:24:41,728
[SPEAKER_19]: Yay, cheat night!

319
00:24:42,129 --> 00:24:47,316
[SPEAKER_19]: Got to go to Old Spaghetti Factory and eat those nasty carbs and all that fun schnazz.

320
00:24:48,958 --> 00:24:52,042
[SPEAKER_19]: This week, unfortunately, has been spent being sick.

321
00:24:53,884 --> 00:24:54,125
[SPEAKER_19]: Sick...

322
00:24:55,126 --> 00:24:55,926
[SPEAKER_19]: Work, school.

323
00:24:56,266 --> 00:24:57,007
[SPEAKER_19]: Sick work, school.

324
00:24:57,167 --> 00:24:58,607
[SPEAKER_19]: That's like my mantra this week.

325
00:24:58,687 --> 00:25:01,268
[SPEAKER_19]: So I ended up having to take a couple days off of work, which sucked.

326
00:25:02,608 --> 00:25:05,329
[SPEAKER_19]: And today has been pretty neato mosquito.

327
00:25:05,369 --> 00:25:09,190
[SPEAKER_19]: Yesterday was pretty neato mosquito because I got to spend a lot of time with Miss DarkSakura.

328
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:12,891
[SPEAKER_19]: And today has been all spiffy because I get to spend it with everybody else.

329
00:25:13,251 --> 00:25:17,092
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm in a relatively good mood and hopefully I won't be like coughing too hard.

330
00:25:17,112 --> 00:25:18,532
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

331
00:25:19,178 --> 00:25:19,598
[SPEAKER_10]: How was your week?

332
00:25:19,638 --> 00:25:20,079
[SPEAKER_10]: How was your day?

333
00:25:20,099 --> 00:25:20,679
[SPEAKER_10]: How was your Halloween?

334
00:25:40,657 --> 00:25:49,475
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, Halloween, I was at work, I did nothing, there was no reason to dress up, I work in a deli, I have a costume that smelt like bleach and meat when I come home.

335
00:25:51,797 --> 00:25:55,718
[SPEAKER_07]: My week, well actually the past couple weeks have just been way too busy for me.

336
00:25:55,838 --> 00:26:01,459
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, shit's been falling apart at work and I've been working like 46, 48 hours a week.

337
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:06,480
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm actually kind of looking forward to being sick right now, hoping it lands on a day that I don't have off.

338
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:12,901
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what, overtime pay rocks though when you've got, and I know you being the import bar, you've got what, eights coming out?

339
00:26:13,701 --> 00:26:19,162
[SPEAKER_07]: There's crap coming out, but on my paychecks right now, they're almost double what I normally get, but...

340
00:26:21,024 --> 00:26:25,685
[SPEAKER_07]: All I've been really buying are all my little collectible stuff, but I don't have any more room.

341
00:26:26,345 --> 00:26:29,826
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even have room for the stuff that's coming in the mail this week.

342
00:26:29,946 --> 00:26:34,607
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually have over $100 left out of my paycheck this week, so I don't know what's going on with that.

343
00:26:34,687 --> 00:26:36,127
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm just going to take some time off.

344
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:41,369
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got to tell that cold to hold off about a week so you can get sick on 15 November.

345
00:26:41,409 --> 00:26:42,249
[SPEAKER_07]: No, three days after.

346
00:26:42,289 --> 00:26:43,169
[SPEAKER_07]: Or maybe 20 November, around that time.

347
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:53,975
[SPEAKER_07]: Assuming my package gets in the States by... No, it can't, because the 18th is Friday.

348
00:26:54,415 --> 00:26:59,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Remembering back to how things process when they ship from Japan, actually it's going to kind of suck, because I'll have to wait more days.

349
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:06,704
[SPEAKER_07]: You have the science down to a T. My shit will ship on any given damn day.

350
00:27:06,804 --> 00:27:12,629
[SPEAKER_07]: As long as the package gets into the States by Friday, it will ship on a weekend or a holiday.

351
00:27:13,209 --> 00:27:16,592
[SPEAKER_07]: If not, it flies around in circles over Hawaii or something for the weekend.

352
00:27:16,612 --> 00:27:20,014
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it gets on San Francisco on Monday, and then it gets processed and whatever.

353
00:27:20,415 --> 00:27:22,016
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, okay, so that was my week.

354
00:27:22,436 --> 00:27:25,178
[SPEAKER_07]: And then today, today was alright.

355
00:27:25,419 --> 00:27:26,900
[SPEAKER_07]: I slept in forever.

356
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,662
[SPEAKER_07]: Tried playing some 2DX again today.

357
00:27:30,703 --> 00:27:36,427
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was having timing problems when going back to old styles.

358
00:27:36,487 --> 00:27:37,248
[SPEAKER_07]: Got pissed off.

359
00:27:37,628 --> 00:27:41,631
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

360
00:28:01,212 --> 00:28:03,353
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, I'm proud of myself.

361
00:28:03,413 --> 00:28:04,373
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are good scores.

362
00:28:04,413 --> 00:28:07,033
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just jealous because I haven't touched my 2DX controller.

363
00:28:07,073 --> 00:28:09,954
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't worry, I'm not going to be bragging on here or anything.

364
00:28:10,034 --> 00:28:11,234
[SPEAKER_07]: That was what I did today.

365
00:28:12,215 --> 00:28:14,115
[SPEAKER_07]: I sucked at everything else today.

366
00:28:15,195 --> 00:28:15,635
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, I'm 10.

367
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:18,156
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to ask something.

368
00:28:18,336 --> 00:28:19,897
[SPEAKER_24]: I actually played 7th style last week.

369
00:28:20,457 --> 00:28:20,717
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you?

370
00:28:20,797 --> 00:28:21,257
[SPEAKER_24]: Yay!

371
00:28:21,537 --> 00:28:23,377
[SPEAKER_24]: So I did do something with the money related.

372
00:28:23,997 --> 00:28:24,538
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there you go.

373
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:25,978
[SPEAKER_24]: And my copy of Papa 9 arrived.

374
00:28:26,653 --> 00:28:27,033
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, right on.

375
00:28:27,454 --> 00:28:28,834
[SPEAKER_24]: I haven't played it yet, but I have it.

376
00:28:30,315 --> 00:28:30,836
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you know what?

377
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:33,677
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have enough time to unlock everything before 10 comes out.

378
00:28:34,017 --> 00:28:35,598
[SPEAKER_07]: That gambler's a bitch.

379
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:37,780
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't even know that I'm going to get 10.

380
00:28:40,361 --> 00:28:43,343
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll take a very, very, very, very long time.

381
00:28:43,383 --> 00:28:44,224
[SPEAKER_24]: That's quite alright.

382
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:46,065
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't have a lot of time to play.

383
00:28:47,065 --> 00:28:49,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe if we find what, you know...

384
00:28:50,168 --> 00:28:53,830
[SPEAKER_07]: Where you have to be in the game to let it sit in its place so the timer will run and count.

385
00:28:54,211 --> 00:28:56,652
[SPEAKER_07]: Find that and let it sit on for, like, you know, a day.

386
00:28:57,413 --> 00:28:58,974
[SPEAKER_24]: I like to play the little RPG mode.

387
00:28:59,094 --> 00:29:01,235
[SPEAKER_24]: You open the chest, you have X song unlocked.

388
00:29:01,255 --> 00:29:01,556
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

389
00:29:02,036 --> 00:29:02,656
[SPEAKER_24]: That's kind of cool.

390
00:29:02,917 --> 00:29:06,499
[SPEAKER_07]: But seriously, it probably took, like, it took... I don't know, whatever, never mind.

391
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:06,839
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

392
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,881
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well then we'll move on.

393
00:29:10,542 --> 00:29:11,763
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go on to Arcadian42.

394
00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:13,324
[SPEAKER_10]: How was your week?

395
00:29:13,364 --> 00:29:13,764
[SPEAKER_10]: How was your day?

396
00:29:13,804 --> 00:29:15,085
[SPEAKER_10]: How was your Halloween?

397
00:29:15,105 --> 00:29:16,966
[SPEAKER_03]: For Halloween, I didn't do jack shit.

398
00:29:18,207 --> 00:29:18,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh...

399
00:29:19,366 --> 00:29:23,509
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I watched Dark City the night before, but didn't do anything on Halloween.

400
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:31,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Next morning I got some candy, but unlike last year, they didn't do the big sale, because it was like Monday instead of like a weekend.

401
00:29:32,056 --> 00:29:36,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Either that or Safeway learned their lesson about people coming in the next day and buying things for like 50 cents.

402
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:48,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead they just did it for half price, so I bought some stuff and shared it with work, and then worked all week and didn't do much this weekend other than straighten up a little bit and then catch up on message boards and

403
00:29:49,673 --> 00:30:03,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Then today went to store and then went to the arcade for a little bit and played one game of Drum Mania and the cymbal was broken and one game of Guitar Freaks and that was working alright.

404
00:30:05,372 --> 00:30:05,712
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all.

405
00:30:06,313 --> 00:30:08,696
[SPEAKER_10]: It's good to know there's still some people in town that actually play Bomani.

406
00:30:08,976 --> 00:30:09,417
[SPEAKER_10]: It's good to know.

407
00:30:10,705 --> 00:30:19,620
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, I wanted to say, because you mentioned the day before Halloween, I just wanted to say a happy late birthday to Navi and Mel B, who both have the same birthday, if you can believe that.

408
00:30:20,061 --> 00:30:20,822
[SPEAKER_10]: Day before Halloween.

409
00:30:21,764 --> 00:30:22,405
[SPEAKER_16]: Very nice.

410
00:30:25,802 --> 00:30:26,862
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm trying to figure out who's older.

411
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:27,563
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

412
00:30:28,383 --> 00:30:30,524
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess I'll talk about my weekend, my day, and my Halloween.

413
00:30:30,544 --> 00:30:33,705
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, my Halloween was kind of stupid because I was having relationship issues.

414
00:30:33,945 --> 00:30:35,945
[SPEAKER_10]: So I didn't really have much of a Halloween.

415
00:30:36,606 --> 00:30:37,986
[SPEAKER_10]: I had a talking to on Halloween.

416
00:30:38,546 --> 00:30:39,867
[SPEAKER_10]: There were no treats on Halloween.

417
00:30:40,407 --> 00:30:41,907
[SPEAKER_10]: And really not even a trick either.

418
00:30:42,788 --> 00:30:43,728
[SPEAKER_24]: But you had good food.

419
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:44,308
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

420
00:30:44,368 --> 00:30:45,208
[SPEAKER_24]: But there was good food.

421
00:30:45,649 --> 00:30:46,509
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, there was good food.

422
00:30:47,009 --> 00:30:52,231
[SPEAKER_10]: And because we had gone to Spaghetti Factory, I went and celebrated Cheat Day, even though every day is Cheat Day for me.

423
00:30:54,344 --> 00:30:55,785
[SPEAKER_24]: We got to make fun of the guys in Walgreens.

424
00:30:56,385 --> 00:30:56,925
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that was cool.

425
00:30:56,945 --> 00:30:59,406
[SPEAKER_10]: We made fun of the guys in Walgreens who were like, I don't know what they were doing.

426
00:30:59,426 --> 00:31:00,366
[SPEAKER_10]: They were hitting on you or something?

427
00:31:00,386 --> 00:31:00,966
[SPEAKER_24]: Maybe they were drunk.

428
00:31:01,327 --> 00:31:01,787
[SPEAKER_10]: They were drunk.

429
00:31:01,827 --> 00:31:02,427
[SPEAKER_10]: They were very drunk.

430
00:31:02,987 --> 00:31:10,110
[SPEAKER_10]: But so, as you may have picked up, a lot of folks in the room here, when we're not doing DDR, we're doing Rocky Horror, so I was involved with all that too.

431
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:11,851
[SPEAKER_10]: Quite involved with all that.

432
00:31:13,111 --> 00:31:14,071
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope you don't see the pictures.

433
00:31:14,592 --> 00:31:18,053
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of girls making threats over there.

434
00:31:18,953 --> 00:31:20,274
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, I got pictures of you too.

435
00:31:20,594 --> 00:31:21,034
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't push me.

436
00:31:24,927 --> 00:31:25,288
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

437
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:28,472
[SPEAKER_10]: So that was Halloween the day before.

438
00:31:28,732 --> 00:31:31,316
[SPEAKER_10]: And this last week was pretty boring.

439
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:35,581
[SPEAKER_10]: I got back into playing Final Fantasy XI, which, you know, addict, right?

440
00:31:35,721 --> 00:31:36,643
[SPEAKER_10]: I play that quite a bit.

441
00:31:37,303 --> 00:31:38,505
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, yeah, that was my cue.

442
00:31:38,845 --> 00:31:39,186
[SPEAKER_10]: Addict.

443
00:31:39,446 --> 00:31:39,807
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

444
00:31:41,328 --> 00:31:44,250
[SPEAKER_10]: And, gosh, not a whole lot else going on, really.

445
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:47,392
[SPEAKER_10]: I was watching Loki play Grand Theft Auto most of the week.

446
00:31:47,412 --> 00:31:49,933
[SPEAKER_10]: I saw The Incredibles last night, which was a cute movie.

447
00:31:50,313 --> 00:31:51,294
[SPEAKER_10]: It was pretty good.

448
00:31:51,314 --> 00:31:52,735
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of people are saying it's going to be Oscar.

449
00:31:53,936 --> 00:31:54,176
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe.

450
00:31:54,336 --> 00:31:54,616
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

451
00:31:55,096 --> 00:31:55,957
[SPEAKER_10]: I like Kill Bill Vol.

452
00:31:56,097 --> 00:31:58,178
[SPEAKER_10]: 2 a little better, but, you know, I just like violence.

453
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:01,120
[SPEAKER_10]: So that was pretty much my week.

454
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:09,505
[SPEAKER_10]: I decided on Saturday, this will be yesterday, that I want to be just like Tanya, and I'm going to start the DDR diet.

455
00:32:10,365 --> 00:32:13,812
[SPEAKER_10]: So I have to modify my diet a little bit because part of my diet is that I want abs.

456
00:32:14,393 --> 00:32:18,020
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm now doing the DDRS diet, which is DDR and sit-ups.

457
00:32:19,571 --> 00:32:20,532
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll see how that works out.

458
00:32:20,552 --> 00:32:21,772
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll keep you posted on my progress.

459
00:32:21,792 --> 00:32:25,674
[SPEAKER_10]: But I found that I'm actually playing Max 2 a lot for DDR.

460
00:32:26,134 --> 00:32:27,495
[SPEAKER_10]: Because nobody's on Ultramix.

461
00:32:27,915 --> 00:32:30,877
[SPEAKER_10]: Like a couple months ago I was playing Ultramix and there would be some nice people on.

462
00:32:31,117 --> 00:32:37,801
[SPEAKER_10]: But I've been kind of pissed off lately because whenever I sign on to Ultramix, all the games on there are like 8 and 9 footer songs, which is cool and all.

463
00:32:37,901 --> 00:32:42,143
[SPEAKER_10]: And I can play those once in a while, but I don't like playing them back to back to back for a half hour.

464
00:32:43,243 --> 00:32:45,905
[SPEAKER_10]: And it really stinks when you're playing against people on a controller.

465
00:32:47,389 --> 00:32:53,514
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I'll have to wait for Ultramix 2 to come out so that Xbox Live kind of gets a swift kick in the ass and, you know, that gets jump-started again.

466
00:32:53,534 --> 00:32:54,295
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll have people playing it.

467
00:32:54,635 --> 00:33:00,740
[SPEAKER_10]: But for the meantime, it's all about the mega dance hits non-stop in Max 2, which has, you know, my Kylie and Ghost and all that stuff.

468
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,780
[SPEAKER_10]: So, it's been a lot of fun.

469
00:33:02,921 --> 00:33:04,222
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, of course, sit-ups.

470
00:33:05,023 --> 00:33:08,706
[SPEAKER_10]: I threw my back out yesterday doing it though because a hard lesson learned.

471
00:33:09,246 --> 00:33:11,507
[SPEAKER_10]: Always stretch before you exercise.

472
00:33:11,808 --> 00:33:13,289
[SPEAKER_10]: Always stretch.

473
00:33:13,749 --> 00:33:14,830
[SPEAKER_10]: How could I be so stupid?

474
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:15,310
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

475
00:33:16,231 --> 00:33:16,511
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

476
00:33:16,951 --> 00:33:18,452
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess we should hear from Loki as well.

477
00:33:19,433 --> 00:33:20,053
[SPEAKER_10]: How was your week?

478
00:33:20,113 --> 00:33:20,713
[SPEAKER_10]: How was your day?

479
00:33:20,794 --> 00:33:21,474
[SPEAKER_10]: How was your Halloween?

480
00:33:22,975 --> 00:33:23,856
[SPEAKER_10]: My week was alright.

481
00:33:23,896 --> 00:33:24,676
[SPEAKER_10]: Didn't do much.

482
00:33:25,857 --> 00:33:26,938
[SPEAKER_10]: What did I do this week?

483
00:33:28,238 --> 00:33:28,879
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't remember.

484
00:33:29,673 --> 00:33:34,034
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's something between Final Fantasy XI and Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.

485
00:33:35,354 --> 00:33:37,535
[SPEAKER_10]: And, um, let's see what else I'll say.

486
00:33:37,895 --> 00:33:42,116
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, we went on our first quote-unquote ghost hunt yesterday.

487
00:33:42,216 --> 00:33:48,257
[SPEAKER_10]: We went to Coloma for what seemed like hours, but actually it was only about an hour.

488
00:33:49,038 --> 00:33:54,359
[SPEAKER_10]: And, um... It was stupid, actually, because...

489
00:33:55,640 --> 00:34:04,195
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, it was just walking around a stupid cemetery and taking pictures of gravestones and that was just like, eh, whatever, but it kind of...

490
00:34:05,163 --> 00:34:08,204
[SPEAKER_10]: We kind of got a dry run for the whole ghost hunting thing.

491
00:34:08,584 --> 00:34:14,405
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyways, related to that, I finished the so-called Gate to Hell device thing.

492
00:34:16,585 --> 00:34:20,906
[SPEAKER_10]: I was hoping to bring it along with me yesterday, but we didn't have a recorder anyway, so that would have not worked.

493
00:34:21,046 --> 00:34:22,187
[SPEAKER_10]: So, how the fuck is that?

494
00:34:22,767 --> 00:34:24,747
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's done, so that's one project out of the way.

495
00:34:25,247 --> 00:34:28,428
[SPEAKER_10]: And other than that, I also saw The Incredibles, and it was awesome.

496
00:34:29,428 --> 00:34:31,588
[SPEAKER_10]: And... What else did I do?

497
00:34:31,608 --> 00:34:32,649
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

498
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:33,649
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, Halloween...

499
00:34:35,478 --> 00:34:44,184
[SPEAKER_10]: Since I was kind of forced to dress up, or I should say persuaded to dress up by my girlfriend, I ended up dressing up like Loki that day.

500
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:51,890
[SPEAKER_10]: I ironically left from Dogma, so I had a nice coat and wings, and that was kind of fun.

501
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:58,775
[SPEAKER_10]: And, I don't know, we just had a party and watched the new Dawn of the Dead and then Shaun of the Dead.

502
00:34:59,155 --> 00:34:59,996
[SPEAKER_10]: So that was awesome.

503
00:35:02,257 --> 00:35:02,918
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's all I did.

504
00:35:06,027 --> 00:35:09,469
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, have you seen that preview for the brand new Mask sequel?

505
00:35:09,729 --> 00:35:11,210
[SPEAKER_10]: You remember the Mask with Jim Carrey?

506
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:14,411
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god, it looks so lame.

507
00:35:14,471 --> 00:35:18,893
[SPEAKER_10]: But Alan Cumming, who is my god, he's so awesome, he plays Loki.

508
00:35:20,494 --> 00:35:21,595
[SPEAKER_19]: Ha ha ha, Cumming.

509
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:24,336
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh boy.

510
00:35:26,437 --> 00:35:26,777
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

511
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:28,358
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess we'll do now.

512
00:35:28,378 --> 00:35:32,100
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to go to another break, and then when we come back, I want to make some big announcements.

513
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:38,623
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a big announcement to make tonight regarding a giveaway, a really, really big giveaway that we're doing.

514
00:35:38,923 --> 00:35:43,065
[SPEAKER_10]: You've heard us talking about it for a while, and we even promised it would happen a couple months ago, but it didn't.

515
00:35:43,325 --> 00:35:46,426
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's all right, because it really, really is happening soon.

516
00:35:46,486 --> 00:35:47,306
[SPEAKER_10]: We actually have a date.

517
00:35:47,567 --> 00:35:50,428
[SPEAKER_10]: We have the prizes in our possession, and if you don't know what we're talking about...

518
00:35:50,768 --> 00:35:54,290
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to talk about it when we come back from this break, featuring more of the Ultramix 2 VRare.

519
00:35:55,031 --> 00:35:58,073
[SPEAKER_10]: Also tonight, we're going to hear some stuff from 2DX Red at some point.

520
00:35:58,153 --> 00:36:04,237
[SPEAKER_10]: So in this break, a lot of you guys in the chat room were requesting to hear the Max 300 remix, so we're going to make that happen for you guys.

521
00:36:04,777 --> 00:36:07,979
[SPEAKER_10]: And as well as some Gyrus, the new Gyrus mix is awesome.

522
00:36:08,139 --> 00:36:12,782
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I know there's some fans of Day Behavior too, so we'll throw them in there as well.

523
00:36:12,822 --> 00:36:14,463
[SPEAKER_10]: So we will be back after this.

524
00:36:14,543 --> 00:36:15,884
[SPEAKER_10]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

525
00:38:41,306 --> 00:38:58,235

[SPEAKER_10]: We are live here on this lovely Sunday evening, as we are every Sunday night.

529
00:42:15,042 --> 00:42:17,903
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a big week for those of you guys that are Xbox fans.

530
00:42:18,323 --> 00:42:19,704
[SPEAKER_10]: I know a lot of you guys have Xbox.

531
00:42:19,924 --> 00:42:21,485
[SPEAKER_10]: Huge game coming out Tuesday.

532
00:42:22,233 --> 00:42:22,954
[SPEAKER_10]: Biggest release.

533
00:42:23,274 --> 00:42:24,995
[SPEAKER_10]: I know you've been waiting for it all year long.

534
00:42:25,595 --> 00:42:28,297
[SPEAKER_10]: Karaoke Revolution is coming out for Xbox on Tuesday.

535
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,580
[SPEAKER_10]: I know you can't wait for it.

536
00:42:33,121 --> 00:42:37,504
[SPEAKER_10]: Now I hear that folks are going to be lining up around the corner at midnight to buy this game.

537
00:42:37,584 --> 00:42:38,405
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's pretty crazy.

538
00:42:39,325 --> 00:42:41,107
[SPEAKER_10]: But just, you know, don't riot please.

539
00:42:41,447 --> 00:42:42,327
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's say orderly.

540
00:42:42,368 --> 00:42:44,469
[SPEAKER_10]: There's enough Karaoke Revolution for everyone.

541
00:42:44,649 --> 00:42:48,112
[SPEAKER_10]: I hear that they expect that there could be extra copies on the shelves.

542
00:42:48,252 --> 00:42:48,892
[SPEAKER_10]: Just a couple.

543
00:42:52,242 --> 00:42:54,943
[SPEAKER_10]: No, but seriously, Karaoke Revolution, what the hell?

544
00:42:55,063 --> 00:42:55,923
[SPEAKER_10]: It came out of nowhere.

545
00:42:56,403 --> 00:43:04,005
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, I know we were talking about Karaoke Revolution, Xbox, a couple weeks ago on the show, and then suddenly, I remember Iguana Girl made a post in her live journal.

546
00:43:04,025 --> 00:43:05,986
[SPEAKER_10]: She was actually talking about Karaoke Revolution Volume 3.

547
00:43:06,186 --> 00:43:07,146
[SPEAKER_19]: Volume 3, yeah.

548
00:43:07,286 --> 00:43:11,487
[SPEAKER_10]: Because, you know, Iguana Girl and I have been known to do some karaoke in the past.

549
00:43:11,907 --> 00:43:19,057
[SPEAKER_19]: and one of the songs that's being featured happens to be something that both Sky and I used to do on a semi-regular basis.

550
00:43:19,378 --> 00:43:20,559
[SPEAKER_10]: Back when we actually spoke.

551
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:26,668
[SPEAKER_19]: And for those that are really interested, there is a file.

552
00:43:26,748 --> 00:43:27,349
[SPEAKER_23]: Jesus Christ.

553
00:43:27,769 --> 00:43:37,935
[SPEAKER_19]: on the internet that you can find somewhere at a particular convention that a particular Sky and I went to.

554
00:43:38,055 --> 00:43:39,776
[SPEAKER_19]: Actually, that was when we first played DDR.

555
00:43:39,796 --> 00:43:42,198
[SPEAKER_10]: That was the same weekend that we first played DDR.

556
00:43:42,218 --> 00:43:46,740
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you want to see what I look like the first time I played DDR with this hideous zit right on my nose.

557
00:43:47,721 --> 00:43:48,562
[SPEAKER_19]: The hideous face!

558
00:43:48,642 --> 00:43:49,422
[SPEAKER_19]: The hideous face!

559
00:43:49,442 --> 00:43:50,283
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh my God, the face!

560
00:43:52,444 --> 00:43:53,925
[SPEAKER_19]: But yeah, if you're...

561
00:43:54,801 --> 00:44:00,466
[SPEAKER_19]: If you're coos enough to be able to find it, then, you know, that file is still out there on the internet so far as I know.

562
00:44:00,486 --> 00:44:06,510
[SPEAKER_10]: Just think about what... Now, pop quiz, you guys, think about what Iguana Girl and I talked about during the last little banter session, okay?

563
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:07,731
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you might be able to find it.

564
00:44:08,212 --> 00:44:08,412
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

565
00:44:09,673 --> 00:44:12,315
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, so anyway, Iguana Girl posted KREF3...

566
00:44:16,573 --> 00:44:24,259
[SPEAKER_10]: And I knew, I had heard the Karaoke Revolution 3 had duets, and I even remember looking at an early song list, but I just kind of skimmed it because there were so many songs.

567
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:27,162
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't even remember connecting that, oh my god, Love Shack was in it.

568
00:44:27,542 --> 00:44:29,103
[SPEAKER_10]: Because maybe at the time I didn't care either.

569
00:44:29,904 --> 00:44:30,284
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

570
00:44:30,745 --> 00:44:31,906
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god.

571
00:44:32,146 --> 00:44:32,326
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

572
00:44:32,346 --> 00:44:33,427
[SPEAKER_10]: That Love Shack crap.

573
00:44:33,647 --> 00:44:35,629
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I don't want to hear that.

574
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:39,873
[SPEAKER_10]: GameFacts.com GameFacts.com

575
00:44:53,625 --> 00:44:55,066
[SPEAKER_19]: and the Karaoke Revolution 2 booth.

576
00:44:55,166 --> 00:44:55,846
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, exactly.

577
00:44:55,866 --> 00:45:00,168
[SPEAKER_19]: Because, you know, they had a nice little seat and it was air-conditioned and I liked to sing.

578
00:45:00,428 --> 00:45:01,728
[SPEAKER_10]: And they had the little Logitech microphones.

579
00:45:01,748 --> 00:45:02,108
[SPEAKER_10]: It was fun.

580
00:45:02,208 --> 00:45:02,809
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

581
00:45:02,829 --> 00:45:05,249
[SPEAKER_19]: Little handhelds, which, thankfully, we're getting.

582
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:08,371
[SPEAKER_10]: It was assumed that, okay, well, we'll get to try this out next May.

583
00:45:08,411 --> 00:45:09,031
[SPEAKER_10]: But I was kind of going...

584
00:45:09,611 --> 00:45:13,973
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, it just seems like, you know, to put out the song, six months to wait for that?

585
00:45:14,013 --> 00:45:14,354
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

586
00:45:14,414 --> 00:45:19,977
[SPEAKER_10]: So I decided to look for a street date, and sure enough, GameFacts.com, I bring it up, says 11-9 is the street date.

587
00:45:20,437 --> 00:45:22,018
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, is Xbox coming out the same day?

588
00:45:22,038 --> 00:45:23,779
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure enough, Karaoke Revolution Xbox, 11-9.

589
00:45:23,799 --> 00:45:27,801
[SPEAKER_10]: A date you guys might have heard of for certain releases of certain games.

590
00:45:28,681 --> 00:45:28,861
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

591
00:45:30,222 --> 00:45:32,243
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I have no idea where the hell this comes from.

592
00:45:32,343 --> 00:45:33,344
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you have any idea, Mel?

593
00:45:33,384 --> 00:45:39,007
[SPEAKER_10]: I know you have some of the inside scoop at Konami, but do you have any idea how the hell this just blindsided us all?

594
00:45:39,714 --> 00:45:43,578
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what all boils down to is it just makes marketing sense.

595
00:45:43,658 --> 00:45:51,486
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, KR1 did really well, KR2, you know, followed up pretty nicely, and hey, it's holiday season, why not milk the product for what it's worth, really?

596
00:45:51,906 --> 00:45:53,108
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's what it boils down to.

597
00:45:53,128 --> 00:45:58,913
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I don't think it's any surprise that we're getting a karaoke revolution 3 and duets, Logical's next step in the right direction, but...

598
00:45:59,758 --> 00:46:00,499
[SPEAKER_10]: That was fast!

599
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:09,207
[SPEAKER_01]: It really wasn't that hard to, you know, I mean, 1 and 2 were pretty much not that different, you know, aside from just one extra in the mode.

600
00:46:09,847 --> 00:46:21,939
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's pretty safe to say after they did, like, KR1, they had already been working on KR3 because it's really just kind of like drop this in and, you know, you just kind of add on top as opposed to redoing a whole new engine.

601
00:46:22,833 --> 00:46:26,576
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I mean, it pretty much looks the same, but now you've got duets, which is kind of cool.

602
00:46:27,297 --> 00:46:32,961
[SPEAKER_10]: Now you guys all out there in Radioland will have to find a friend to play this game with.

603
00:46:33,562 --> 00:46:34,522
[SPEAKER_10]: Please go out and find a friend.

604
00:46:34,803 --> 00:46:39,747
[SPEAKER_10]: No, please, in fact, just for the sake of having a life.

605
00:46:39,767 --> 00:46:40,387
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm kidding.

606
00:46:41,928 --> 00:46:43,870
[SPEAKER_10]: But this is good, because now Iwana Girl and I can practice.

607
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:49,514
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you know, someday, at our favorite bar, they have to do a duets contest.

608
00:46:49,655 --> 00:46:50,936
[SPEAKER_10]: Someday, it's got to happen.

609
00:46:51,735 --> 00:46:54,176
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we need to talk to our favorite KJ about making that happen.

610
00:46:54,196 --> 00:46:55,377
[SPEAKER_10]: Because we've got to win that.

611
00:46:57,298 --> 00:46:58,639
[SPEAKER_10]: So we can spend the money on games.

612
00:47:00,299 --> 00:47:02,100
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I'm going to be fucking broke after November.

613
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:03,021
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know about you guys.

614
00:47:04,422 --> 00:47:05,602
[SPEAKER_10]: Quick poll, going around the room.

615
00:47:05,942 --> 00:47:07,343
[SPEAKER_10]: Games you're looking forward to by the end of the year.

616
00:47:07,363 --> 00:47:10,105
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't have to be Babani, just any games you're looking forward to by the end of the year.

617
00:47:11,485 --> 00:47:14,007
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man, there's still more stuff out there.

618
00:47:14,127 --> 00:47:15,327
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, it's kind of hard to say.

619
00:47:15,347 --> 00:47:19,109
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, obviously, yeah, you know, the 8th style is definitely the one I'm looking forward to.

620
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:20,190
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um...

621
00:47:20,885 --> 00:47:24,408
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still looking forward to Rumble Roses, that's going to be pretty dope.

622
00:47:26,269 --> 00:47:28,331
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that does come out Tuesday, awesome.

623
00:47:28,811 --> 00:47:45,605
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like most of the games I'm looking forward to have already come out, and it's like, you know what, I need to look forward to more, man, I'm still catching up on like three or four more games, you know, it's like, maybe by March, you know, I'll be caught up, and then by that time E3 rolls around, and it's like, great, more anticipation, you know, in May, and so on and so on.

624
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:56,704
[SPEAKER_01]: I figured they're just kind of blowing everything out now because once next-gen systems come out, you know, obviously those first launch titles usually kind of blow ass and, you know, but yeah, I think Romo Bros.

625
00:47:56,724 --> 00:47:58,646
[SPEAKER_01]: right now is definitely high on my list.

626
00:47:59,386 --> 00:47:59,806
[SPEAKER_10]: Sounds good.

627
00:47:59,826 --> 00:48:00,987
[SPEAKER_10]: Shark Skrull, anything you're looking forward to?

628
00:48:01,883 --> 00:48:07,888
[SPEAKER_21]: Right now it's mostly like Ultramix 2 and 8th Style because I've got all this stuff.

629
00:48:08,168 --> 00:48:10,150
[SPEAKER_21]: I just got Donkey Kongo a month or two ago.

630
00:48:10,170 --> 00:48:11,110
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, how was that?

631
00:48:11,671 --> 00:48:12,672
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, I love that game.

632
00:48:12,692 --> 00:48:14,453
[SPEAKER_10]: We didn't get a chance to pick it up for the show here.

633
00:48:14,553 --> 00:48:15,494
[SPEAKER_10]: That and Tycho, we completely missed.

634
00:48:15,514 --> 00:48:16,675
[SPEAKER_21]: I am so freaking addicted to it.

635
00:48:16,755 --> 00:48:18,456
[SPEAKER_21]: I just sit there and just bop away.

636
00:48:18,496 --> 00:48:19,657
[SPEAKER_21]: My mom's like, what the hell are you doing?

637
00:48:19,677 --> 00:48:20,898
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm playing Kongo, leave me alone.

638
00:48:21,979 --> 00:48:26,562
[SPEAKER_21]: And my friend from Nashville, Cincinnati, everywhere just came back and he's got it too.

639
00:48:26,663 --> 00:48:28,224
[SPEAKER_21]: So I found someone I can play with.

640
00:48:28,723 --> 00:48:30,805
[SPEAKER_10]: I might have to buy this too before the next time I visit.

641
00:48:30,945 --> 00:48:31,165
[SPEAKER_10]: It's fun.

642
00:48:31,185 --> 00:48:32,626
[SPEAKER_10]: It will drive your mom crazy.

643
00:48:32,646 --> 00:48:33,447
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a lot of fun.

644
00:48:33,867 --> 00:48:35,949
[SPEAKER_21]: But, yeah, you know, I got that.

645
00:48:35,969 --> 00:48:36,830
[SPEAKER_21]: I just got Burnout 3.

646
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:38,711
[SPEAKER_21]: I got Star Wars Battlefront.

647
00:48:38,851 --> 00:48:40,212
[SPEAKER_21]: I got Katamari Damacy.

648
00:48:40,252 --> 00:48:42,154
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm just catching up to everything I've just bought recently.

649
00:48:42,194 --> 00:48:43,054
[SPEAKER_21]: And Dr. Mario.

650
00:48:44,015 --> 00:48:47,458
[SPEAKER_21]: The freaking crack game from way back.

651
00:48:49,279 --> 00:48:49,680
[SPEAKER_21]: So, yeah.

652
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:51,801
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm just catching up to what I already bought.

653
00:48:51,821 --> 00:48:52,662
[SPEAKER_10]: Right on.

654
00:48:52,742 --> 00:48:53,263
[SPEAKER_21]: For the most part.

655
00:48:54,263 --> 00:48:54,644
[SPEAKER_10]: Sounds good.

656
00:48:55,164 --> 00:48:56,225
[SPEAKER_10]: Islander, what are you looking forward to?

657
00:48:57,823 --> 00:48:59,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Mel, I'm looking forward to Rumble Roses.

658
00:49:00,785 --> 00:49:05,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much everything that I'm looking forward to has already been released.

659
00:49:07,729 --> 00:49:09,130
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of things I still need to pick up.

660
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:13,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably, for example, MK Deception.

661
00:49:13,852 --> 00:49:14,993
[SPEAKER_02]: I still want to pick up just for MK1.

662
00:49:15,013 --> 00:49:18,935
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to get the Collector's Edition for MK1, though.

663
00:49:18,975 --> 00:49:20,896
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought Deception, but it doesn't have MK1 on it.

664
00:49:20,957 --> 00:49:21,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, okay.

665
00:49:21,697 --> 00:49:22,718
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I know about that.

666
00:49:23,898 --> 00:49:24,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Other than that, there's...

667
00:49:25,831 --> 00:49:38,922
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a few others, but I mean recently we just picked up, you know, of course we have Extreme, Katamari Damacy, Madden 2005 for me, and SmackDown vs. Raw for myself, and between those four games, I mean, there's still stuff on Extreme that I haven't unlocked yet.

668
00:49:40,203 --> 00:49:48,731
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, because I've got so much stuff to play, so most of the stuff I've been looking for has already been released, so I just need to, you know, just kind of save up for them.

669
00:49:50,072 --> 00:49:50,312
[SPEAKER_10]: Right on.

670
00:49:50,372 --> 00:49:51,413
[SPEAKER_10]: Iguana Girl, what are you looking forward to?

671
00:49:53,463 --> 00:50:01,034
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I would officially like to start the Iguana Girl Really Needs New Games Fund because I am too damn broke to be able to afford anything.

672
00:50:02,296 --> 00:50:07,403
[SPEAKER_19]: I would really, really love to be able to get A-Style, but first I'd love to get 7-Style, a new controller.

673
00:50:09,305 --> 00:50:13,648
[SPEAKER_19]: It's kind of helpful to have a controller that functions.

674
00:50:13,668 --> 00:50:15,049
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you have a PayPal you want to plug?

675
00:50:17,331 --> 00:50:18,332
[SPEAKER_19]: If I could remember the name, I would.

676
00:50:20,613 --> 00:50:26,678
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm incredibly broke and trying to make ends meet, but almost out of debt type of deal.

677
00:50:28,019 --> 00:50:30,703
[SPEAKER_19]: I would love to get 8th style, I'd love to get 7th style still.

678
00:50:32,105 --> 00:50:36,091
[SPEAKER_19]: And I would love to get an Xbox to be able to play the Xbox versions of games.

679
00:50:36,993 --> 00:50:40,278
[SPEAKER_19]: And also, of course, because I'm a karaoke whore, Karaoke Revolution 3.

680
00:50:41,650 --> 00:50:42,130
[SPEAKER_08]: Very cool.

681
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:42,530
[SPEAKER_08]: Navi.

682
00:50:43,051 --> 00:50:45,291
[SPEAKER_08]: And I bet you not a single one of his games are going to be domestic.

683
00:50:46,512 --> 00:50:47,973
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, yeah.

684
00:50:48,173 --> 00:50:52,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, as far as ones that have yet to be released.

685
00:50:52,754 --> 00:50:58,177
[SPEAKER_07]: I still want to play Deception and San Andreas, but just haven't really gotten around to it.

686
00:50:59,117 --> 00:51:01,298
[SPEAKER_07]: I am so looking forward to...

687
00:51:01,843 --> 00:51:03,364
[SPEAKER_07]: Any interest in the US version at all?

688
00:51:30,885 --> 00:51:31,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably not.

689
00:51:33,446 --> 00:51:33,706
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

690
00:51:33,746 --> 00:51:36,308
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't checked out any song listings for that yet, though.

691
00:51:37,788 --> 00:51:40,730
[SPEAKER_07]: But... God, what else was there?

692
00:51:42,151 --> 00:51:46,733
[SPEAKER_07]: Supposedly, the sequel to Karate Mani Damashii is still supposed to be out before the year's over, so...

693
00:51:48,843 --> 00:51:52,425
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, well, the Japanese one came out in February.

694
00:51:55,546 --> 00:51:56,607
[SPEAKER_07]: They haven't given a release date on it.

695
00:51:56,627 --> 00:52:00,689
[SPEAKER_07]: They're being all super secretive on it, but I think it still says it's supposed to be out before the end of the year.

696
00:52:01,109 --> 00:52:06,312
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I think I'm going to go get one of those Dragon Warrior slime controllers.

697
00:52:07,112 --> 00:52:08,313
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are so cute.

698
00:52:08,813 --> 00:52:10,174
[SPEAKER_10]: What site can they go to to check those out?

699
00:52:10,454 --> 00:52:12,895
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, they're now up for pre-order.

700
00:52:12,995 --> 00:52:13,916
[SPEAKER_07]: I just checked last night.

701
00:52:13,936 --> 00:52:16,978
[SPEAKER_07]: They're up for pre-orders at NCSX and Japan Video Games, and they're $45.00.

702
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:18,840
Yeah.

703
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:19,580
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

704
00:52:20,501 --> 00:52:20,881
[SPEAKER_29]: Arcadian.

705
00:52:22,902 --> 00:52:31,385
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the only thing I'd be anticipating would be 8th style, because there's so many things, even, there's so many songs I like in that mix, in that style.

706
00:52:32,185 --> 00:52:34,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though I haven't played, like, 7th style in months.

707
00:52:35,127 --> 00:52:41,589
[SPEAKER_03]: Mainly because I, since I do typing and stuff all day, it's kind of hard to do more stuff with my hands.

708
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:46,471
[SPEAKER_03]: And nothing really else, because I hardly follow games anymore.

709
00:52:46,491 --> 00:52:47,412
[SPEAKER_10]: Aw.

710
00:52:47,672 --> 00:52:48,132
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's alright.

711
00:52:49,649 --> 00:52:57,595
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't touched my Japanese PS2 in months.

712
00:52:57,615 --> 00:52:58,496
[SPEAKER_10]: It feels so neglected.

713
00:52:58,536 --> 00:53:01,098
[SPEAKER_10]: It's crying in my room under the pile of laundry it's under.

714
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,703
[SPEAKER_10]: I need to cuddle with it tonight and let it know I still love it.

715
00:53:06,743 --> 00:53:08,165
[SPEAKER_10]: I just, you know, have no use for it.

716
00:53:08,765 --> 00:53:12,990
[SPEAKER_10]: There's some rejection.

717
00:53:13,070 --> 00:53:15,293
[SPEAKER_24]: Poor thing's going to go crying off to the Xbox now.

718
00:53:17,295 --> 00:53:20,419
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god, my JPS2 is going to elope with my GameCube.

719
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:26,351
[SPEAKER_10]: Ever since Josh and I stopped playing Four Swords, I haven't touched the GameCube either.

720
00:53:26,371 --> 00:53:27,072
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to elope.

721
00:53:28,052 --> 00:53:29,032
[SPEAKER_24]: You'll get the GS2.

722
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:34,694
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, what are you looking forward to this holiday?

723
00:53:34,774 --> 00:53:39,296
[SPEAKER_24]: Definitely ApeStyle, which I actually have to go and play Asia and make my pre-order.

724
00:53:41,217 --> 00:53:47,759
[SPEAKER_24]: Actually, I know for sure I'm getting the Taiko no Tatsujin US one, because Dan basically slipped and told me he was getting it for me.

725
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:52,001
[SPEAKER_24]: Although he made an interesting slip something about an arcade-style controller, but...

726
00:53:52,748 --> 00:53:55,129
[SPEAKER_10]: for GDX.

727
00:53:55,149 --> 00:53:56,930
[SPEAKER_24]: We were talking about expensive presents.

728
00:53:58,531 --> 00:54:01,173
[SPEAKER_10]: Jamie's favorite kind, for those listening, by the way.

729
00:54:03,414 --> 00:54:10,539
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't really think I'm going to get it, but I was talking about a $400 set of Copic markers that I wanted.

730
00:54:10,839 --> 00:54:12,840
[SPEAKER_24]: They had it at A1 Comics, and I was like,

731
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:17,724
[SPEAKER_24]: I really want this, but I would rather have a tablet, because I want a nice big art tablet.

732
00:54:18,065 --> 00:54:21,288
[SPEAKER_24]: He was like, well, you could get that, or you could get an arcade-style controller.

733
00:54:21,568 --> 00:54:22,649
[SPEAKER_24]: And then he didn't say anything else.

734
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:24,991
[SPEAKER_24]: I was like, ooh.

735
00:54:25,371 --> 00:54:26,312
[SPEAKER_30]: Very interesting.

736
00:54:26,532 --> 00:54:26,873
[SPEAKER_24]: Very.

737
00:54:27,613 --> 00:54:30,176
[SPEAKER_24]: Although, honestly, I want to try actually building one.

738
00:54:31,525 --> 00:54:36,769
[SPEAKER_07]: And I haven't seen any place now that has 2DX arcade style controllers for anything less than $500 now.

739
00:54:36,909 --> 00:54:38,410
[SPEAKER_10]: Wasn't there a third party that was making one though?

740
00:54:38,430 --> 00:54:38,590
[SPEAKER_10]: Huh?

741
00:54:38,770 --> 00:54:40,632
[SPEAKER_10]: Wasn't there a third party that was getting one to make one?

742
00:54:40,812 --> 00:54:41,492
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know about that.

743
00:54:42,113 --> 00:54:45,835
[SPEAKER_07]: There's tons of third parties for pop and music arcade style controllers and they're only like $250.

744
00:54:45,915 --> 00:54:48,877
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, they've gone up like $150 since I got mine.

745
00:54:49,157 --> 00:54:49,978
[SPEAKER_24]: See, I can just make one.

746
00:54:49,998 --> 00:54:52,219
[SPEAKER_24]: That's crazy.

747
00:54:52,279 --> 00:54:52,620
[SPEAKER_24]: Wow.

748
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:56,182
[SPEAKER_24]: I found all the schematics to make one myself so I could do it if I had time.

749
00:54:56,202 --> 00:54:57,243
[SPEAKER_24]: But...

750
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:04,281
[SPEAKER_24]: As far as any other game, I definitely want Katamari Damacy 2.

751
00:55:05,061 --> 00:55:09,683
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sort of in about DDR right now just because I'm so busy with everything else I don't really have time to play.

752
00:55:11,763 --> 00:55:15,104
[SPEAKER_24]: I was actually thinking about getting the DDR aerobics game though.

753
00:55:15,924 --> 00:55:16,865
[SPEAKER_24]: Cute.

754
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:17,605
[SPEAKER_24]: What was it?

755
00:55:18,937 --> 00:55:21,618
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember it was Aerobic Revolution or something.

756
00:55:21,638 --> 00:55:22,679
[SPEAKER_24]: I was thinking about it.

757
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:23,579
[SPEAKER_24]: I was sort of happy.

758
00:55:23,719 --> 00:55:25,860
[SPEAKER_10]: We heard it was coming out and then we didn't hear anything else.

759
00:55:25,981 --> 00:55:28,062
[SPEAKER_24]: The game I want that already came out in the U.S.

760
00:55:28,122 --> 00:55:29,002
[SPEAKER_24]: but it's really crappy.

761
00:55:29,382 --> 00:55:31,223
[SPEAKER_24]: I decided to import Bujingai.

762
00:55:32,344 --> 00:55:34,945
[SPEAKER_24]: It's the game with Gakuta as the main character.

763
00:55:35,125 --> 00:55:37,046
[SPEAKER_10]: Now somebody had sent me a link about this.

764
00:55:37,426 --> 00:55:38,567
[SPEAKER_10]: Gakuta was doing a voice.

765
00:55:38,827 --> 00:55:40,027
[SPEAKER_10]: I think Dark Knight was telling me about this.

766
00:55:40,047 --> 00:55:41,088
[SPEAKER_24]: He's the whole character model.

767
00:55:41,448 --> 00:55:42,008
[SPEAKER_10]: That's awesome.

768
00:55:42,288 --> 00:55:49,753
[SPEAKER_24]: The game, it was, in fact, I put pictures in my live journal way back when, you know, when they were actually in production of the game.

769
00:55:51,253 --> 00:55:57,977
[SPEAKER_24]: But it just looked really, really awesome, and I heard that they really, really butchered it for the U.S., but now the import's going to be cheap since the U.S.

770
00:55:58,017 --> 00:55:58,697
[SPEAKER_24]: version is out.

771
00:55:59,238 --> 00:55:59,418
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, okay.

772
00:55:59,438 --> 00:56:04,721
[SPEAKER_24]: The live importers should have it really cheap, but I have to go around jumping around from, you know, building to building as Gak.

773
00:56:04,741 --> 00:56:06,782
[SPEAKER_24]: Gak didn't have to... And all of this fabulousness.

774
00:56:07,122 --> 00:56:09,083
[SPEAKER_10]: He didn't have to speak in English for the English one, did he?

775
00:56:09,403 --> 00:56:10,484
[SPEAKER_24]: No, they probably got somebody else.

776
00:56:10,504 --> 00:56:10,844
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't...

777
00:56:12,302 --> 00:56:15,907
[SPEAKER_24]: I can't hear another voice with that.

778
00:56:16,268 --> 00:56:18,992
[SPEAKER_24]: I have to have his, you know, voice.

779
00:56:19,853 --> 00:56:21,416
[SPEAKER_24]: It just doesn't, I wouldn't be right.

780
00:56:22,537 --> 00:56:23,258
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, anything else?

781
00:56:24,741 --> 00:56:26,223
[SPEAKER_24]: Hopefully a game where I can shoot things.

782
00:56:27,284 --> 00:56:27,525
[SPEAKER_10]: Right on.

783
00:56:28,767 --> 00:56:56,237
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, as far as my, uh, top three games for this holiday season, I would say number three is a tie, um, 2DX8Style, I gotta get, I know it's gonna get me back into 2DX, which I'm sure makes Navi, yeah, he's grinning over there, cause, he missed, I guess, I suck now, and it used to be like, Navi and I would have little friendly competitions about, you know, who can beat this song first, and then at one point I just said, ah, fuck it, you beat him, and I just kinda quit 2DX, but I think 8Style might get me back into it a little bit, but it's kind of a tie, because Rumble Roses,

784
00:56:56,977 --> 00:56:57,778
[SPEAKER_10]: I really want it.

785
00:56:57,998 --> 00:57:04,402
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is strange because, and this is no secret to those of you who listen to the show, I'm a gay guy.

786
00:57:04,483 --> 00:57:05,763
[SPEAKER_10]: Since when did you turn straight?

787
00:57:06,704 --> 00:57:07,305
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

788
00:57:07,585 --> 00:57:08,545
[SPEAKER_10]: It's hilarious.

789
00:57:08,826 --> 00:57:18,753
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, the thought of women kicking the shit out of each other in mud wrestling to Bomani music type stuff because the artists are doing it, it's hilarious to me.

790
00:57:19,161 --> 00:57:25,807
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I mean, jeez, I'm a straight chick, and I love playing DOA, Extreme Beach Volleyball, and putting them in the tiniest little freaking bikinis I can find.

791
00:57:26,008 --> 00:57:26,548
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

792
00:57:26,668 --> 00:57:27,409
[SPEAKER_21]: I do it all the time.

793
00:57:27,449 --> 00:57:33,835
[SPEAKER_10]: There's something about being able to kick the shit out of, you know, become a woman that can kick the shit out of everybody.

794
00:57:34,676 --> 00:57:34,996
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

795
00:57:35,717 --> 00:57:39,521
[SPEAKER_10]: No, and I'm not one of those, like, transsexual whatever's, okay, I just...

796
00:57:40,145 --> 00:57:40,885
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's fun.

797
00:57:41,045 --> 00:57:52,128
[SPEAKER_10]: Then after they've slowly beat each other to submission in the mud, they slowly strip off the clothes and go at it in a very aggressive sexual, uh, yeah.

798
00:57:52,748 --> 00:57:54,509
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob is all about empowerment.

799
00:57:54,629 --> 00:57:55,249
[SPEAKER_10]: I need to tell.

800
00:57:56,649 --> 00:58:07,012
[SPEAKER_10]: No, um, before we get too far away from it, the third party controllers I was thinking about for 2DX would be Controlica, which is a new site that's actually come out.

801
00:58:07,352 --> 00:58:09,053
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to be selling, supposedly in the winter, um,

802
00:58:10,682 --> 00:58:15,844
[SPEAKER_10]: 2DX arcade style controllers that are supposed to be on par, or if not better, for $3.75 plus shipping.

803
00:58:17,145 --> 00:58:24,448
[SPEAKER_10]: And based on their popping music controller, which looks just like an arcade style controller, all metal, really nice, it should be pretty good.

804
00:58:26,405 --> 00:58:27,426
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

805
00:58:42,902 --> 00:58:44,503
[SPEAKER_10]: I want Halo 2 really bad.

806
00:58:44,523 --> 00:58:44,964
[SPEAKER_22]: Me too!

807
00:58:45,064 --> 00:58:45,925
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh my god, me too!

808
00:58:46,325 --> 00:58:48,467
[SPEAKER_22]: And we can play online and I can run over you with the Warthog.

809
00:58:49,427 --> 00:58:50,068
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, this is the thing.

810
00:58:50,128 --> 00:59:03,058
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, you guys have to understand that back when I was in college, my buddies at Sonoma State, I had a bunch of friends that went to Sonoma State over in the Bay, and they all had a really fast internet connection, so they would set up Quake servers, and I used to get on there and school them at Quake.

811
00:59:03,118 --> 00:59:04,019
[SPEAKER_10]: I was really good.

812
00:59:04,119 --> 00:59:04,779
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't listen to them.

813
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:05,980
[SPEAKER_10]: I was the best at Quake, okay?

814
00:59:06,801 --> 00:59:09,083
[SPEAKER_10]: And so now the Halo 2's out and it's on Xbox Live.

815
00:59:09,164 --> 00:59:12,727
[SPEAKER_10]: Like everybody that was in college, that little circle of friends in college, they have an Xbox.

816
00:59:12,747 --> 00:59:13,888
[SPEAKER_10]: They're all getting Xbox Live.

817
00:59:13,908 --> 00:59:16,411
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's like we're going to relive the old days through Halo 2.

818
00:59:16,731 --> 00:59:17,452
[SPEAKER_10]: It's so precious.

819
00:59:17,972 --> 00:59:19,614
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, I really, really want Halo 2.

820
00:59:19,694 --> 00:59:20,355
[SPEAKER_10]: So shut up.

821
00:59:20,455 --> 00:59:20,855
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't hate.

822
00:59:21,256 --> 00:59:22,197
[SPEAKER_10]: Why do you suck now?

823
00:59:22,377 --> 00:59:22,717
[SPEAKER_10]: Shut up!

824
00:59:24,379 --> 00:59:25,660
[SPEAKER_19]: Because he's gay, duh.

825
00:59:27,762 --> 00:59:29,825
[SPEAKER_10]: Now I remember why we haven't had you on the show in a year.

826
00:59:31,581 --> 00:59:32,401
[SPEAKER_10]: Just kidding.

827
00:59:32,501 --> 00:59:35,063
[SPEAKER_10]: And then my number one, absolutely DDR Ultimix 2.

828
00:59:36,263 --> 00:59:37,724
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe it's going to live up to the hype.

829
00:59:38,044 --> 00:59:39,165
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's going to be awesome.

830
00:59:39,405 --> 00:59:43,907
[SPEAKER_10]: I have no doubt it's going to be a Bomani fan's wet dream this winter.

831
00:59:43,987 --> 00:59:45,908
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm looking forward to it, definitely.

832
00:59:46,348 --> 00:59:50,130
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm also looking forward to being able to play, and Sigurd has already accepted this challenge.

833
00:59:50,530 --> 00:59:55,133
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to play Sigurd on this show, live, and beat him at his own steps.

834
00:59:55,813 --> 00:59:58,334
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the challenge that's on the table right now.

835
00:59:58,374 --> 00:59:58,935
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you listening?

836
00:59:59,235 --> 00:59:59,675
[SPEAKER_10]: You listening?

837
01:00:01,465 --> 01:00:01,985
[SPEAKER_10]: It's on!

838
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:03,106
[SPEAKER_10]: It's already been broughten!

839
01:00:04,286 --> 01:00:04,726
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

840
01:00:06,206 --> 01:00:07,107
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, was that everybody?

841
01:00:07,167 --> 01:00:08,727
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, I didn't get your top three.

842
01:00:08,747 --> 01:00:10,828
[SPEAKER_10]: What are you looking forward to this holiday season?

843
01:00:13,088 --> 01:00:13,389
[SPEAKER_10]: Give me.

844
01:00:15,109 --> 01:00:18,590
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if this is coming out within this time frame, but Alien Hominid.

845
01:00:21,331 --> 01:00:21,771
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

846
01:00:21,831 --> 01:00:23,272
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't pay attention to this shit.

847
01:00:23,992 --> 01:00:24,372
[SPEAKER_10]: God.

848
01:00:25,242 --> 01:00:26,683
[SPEAKER_07]: So that one looked really awesome.

849
01:00:28,163 --> 01:00:30,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Did I tell you about that last time I was here, though?

850
01:00:30,504 --> 01:00:30,924
[SPEAKER_07]: Nope.

851
01:00:31,004 --> 01:00:34,566
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, you mentioned it, but then wasn't it like your friend or something?

852
01:00:35,406 --> 01:00:39,267
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, my friend James, his friend is the one who designed it.

853
01:00:39,588 --> 01:00:40,228
[SPEAKER_07]: Looks awesome.

854
01:00:40,308 --> 01:00:40,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

855
01:00:41,608 --> 01:00:42,449
[SPEAKER_10]: So that one would be cool.

856
01:00:44,830 --> 01:00:49,351
[SPEAKER_10]: Gosh, really, as far as video games, I'm not looking forward to anything, to be honest.

857
01:00:49,972 --> 01:00:53,293
[SPEAKER_10]: Really, E3, I was just kind of, eh, you know, so...

858
01:00:54,682 --> 01:00:56,883
[SPEAKER_10]: No, there's not really anything I'm looking forward to at all.

859
01:00:57,404 --> 01:01:00,286
[SPEAKER_10]: Um... No, I can't think of anything.

860
01:01:00,886 --> 01:01:06,370
[SPEAKER_10]: Unless, um... Well... Well... You know what?

861
01:01:06,390 --> 01:01:09,592
[SPEAKER_10]: You got Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, and you can beat Cop Senseless with your pimp cane.

862
01:01:09,692 --> 01:01:11,473
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if there's anything else that really you need.

863
01:01:13,095 --> 01:01:16,880
[SPEAKER_10]: They could always have a Driver 4 so that I could see even worse AI.

864
01:01:17,841 --> 01:01:18,242
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

865
01:01:18,582 --> 01:01:20,324
[SPEAKER_10]: My god, that game sucks.

866
01:01:21,286 --> 01:01:24,490
[SPEAKER_10]: I just, the only reason I play it is just to see how bad it sucks.

867
01:01:26,332 --> 01:01:28,034
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, it's great.

868
01:01:28,154 --> 01:01:30,638
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's funny, though, because Grand Theft Auto San Andreas...

869
01:01:31,258 --> 01:01:36,162
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a point in the game where you have to go into this rapper's house and steal his rhyme book.

870
01:01:36,723 --> 01:01:41,006
[SPEAKER_10]: And he's playing Driver 3 and seeing how bad it sucks when you walk by him.

871
01:01:41,627 --> 01:01:42,247
[SPEAKER_10]: It's great.

872
01:01:43,048 --> 01:01:51,395
[SPEAKER_10]: The other thing I'm really looking forward to, and hopefully they'll get it out by winter 2004, it's In The Groove, the home version.

873
01:01:55,635 --> 01:01:57,997
[SPEAKER_24]: Dot, dot, dot.

874
01:01:58,117 --> 01:01:59,118
[SPEAKER_10]: No, actually, I don't care.

875
01:01:59,498 --> 01:02:04,862
[SPEAKER_10]: But I would like to see Pump It Up exceed.

876
01:02:04,982 --> 01:02:05,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

877
01:02:05,503 --> 01:02:06,344
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to see that.

878
01:02:06,404 --> 01:02:07,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that looks interesting.

879
01:02:07,585 --> 01:02:12,308
[SPEAKER_10]: Even though I don't play Pump It Up and I despise the arcade, I'd still like to see it because it'd be something different.

880
01:02:15,811 --> 01:02:19,394
[SPEAKER_10]: God, you know, I don't know.

881
01:02:19,454 --> 01:02:21,095
[SPEAKER_10]: All the good games have already come out.

882
01:02:21,135 --> 01:02:22,977
[SPEAKER_10]: Most of the Konami ones are already out, so...

883
01:02:25,332 --> 01:02:27,813
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know, I don't know, I can't think of any good ones.

884
01:02:28,494 --> 01:02:38,301
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess Metal Gear Solid 3, but I don't like even playing Metal Gear Solid 3, or Solid, or Solid 2, so, I don't know, the, uh, the DS, I guess?

885
01:02:38,641 --> 01:02:40,122
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, that might be pretty cool.

886
01:02:41,483 --> 01:02:45,606
[SPEAKER_10]: So they can start re-releasing, oh, a new Animal Crossing game, if that ever comes out.

887
01:02:46,787 --> 01:02:48,148
[SPEAKER_10]: Animal Crossing DS would be cool.

888
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:55,166
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, these are those times when I'm very grateful my man works where he does, so I can get my free DS.

889
01:02:55,306 --> 01:02:55,826
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.

890
01:02:56,707 --> 01:02:58,489
[SPEAKER_24]: Hey, have you gotten a copy of the Ultramix 2 VR?

891
01:02:59,470 --> 01:03:01,252
[SPEAKER_24]: He's got it, he just hasn't brought it home for me yet.

892
01:03:02,033 --> 01:03:02,333
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

893
01:03:02,373 --> 01:03:06,478
[SPEAKER_10]: I know those are hitting the shelves, so if you haven't found yours yet, go bug your local GameStop.

894
01:03:08,135 --> 01:03:08,576
[SPEAKER_10]: It's great.

895
01:03:08,636 --> 01:03:09,317
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a great CD.

896
01:03:09,498 --> 01:03:11,941
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, even if it wasn't even DDR related, it's still a great CD.

897
01:03:12,021 --> 01:03:17,750
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it is just awesome that for the first time we have full length versions of songs that weren't done by Konami.

898
01:03:17,770 --> 01:03:18,532
[SPEAKER_10]: That's pretty cool.

899
01:03:18,812 --> 01:03:21,957
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, not that Konami songs are bad, don't get me wrong, but it's just neat to have other stuff on there.

900
01:03:22,037 --> 01:03:23,279
[SPEAKER_10]: So check it out if you haven't yet.

901
01:03:24,502 --> 01:03:34,826
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if you guys noticed this, and this is out in the Ultramix 2 thread over on the Freak right now, so there's no secret, but that AlienC16, whatever the guy's name is, his website...

902
01:03:44,990 --> 01:03:45,170
[SPEAKER_10]: T.O.Y.

903
01:04:08,314 --> 01:04:08,614
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

904
01:04:11,757 --> 01:04:14,699
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, okay, I want to talk about some things that are going to be coming up on the station.

905
01:04:15,079 --> 01:04:16,000
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously, I teased this.

906
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:17,581
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got a contest that's going to be coming up.

907
01:04:18,001 --> 01:04:21,104
[SPEAKER_10]: And Floatwalk, you were a big part of helping hook us up with this.

908
01:04:21,424 --> 01:04:25,427
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm actually going to, if you don't mind, DarkSakura, I'm going to bring up the cam for a minute because I want to put these on the cam real fast.

909
01:04:25,787 --> 01:04:26,668
[SPEAKER_10]: But let us know about it.

910
01:04:26,708 --> 01:04:32,132
[SPEAKER_10]: We've talked about it on the station a little bit before, but remind us again, Floatwalk, what are we doing with our buddies at DDR Spot right now?

911
01:04:32,392 --> 01:04:38,160
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, DDR Spot, for those who actually come visit us once in a while, we'll reward you.

912
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:43,286
[SPEAKER_01]: Because roughly around next week or so, we're going to relaunch basically another version.

913
01:04:43,947 --> 01:04:48,633
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously it's going to be more or less coinciding with Ultramix 2 coming out and such.

914
01:04:49,756 --> 01:04:51,778
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge is doing a giveaway, as are we.

915
01:04:52,178 --> 01:04:55,881
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're doing the same gifts, actually, which I have brought up finally.

916
01:04:56,661 --> 01:05:01,805
[SPEAKER_01]: As you know, of course, me being the man and all that kind of stuff, I got my hookups here and there.

917
01:05:02,365 --> 01:05:07,329
[SPEAKER_01]: And those in Orange Lounge, I know a bunch of y'all are Kira Yamaoka fans.

918
01:05:07,409 --> 01:05:16,556
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got four of his promotional CDs, which are actually like little mini CDs, which have, I believe one of them is the...

919
01:05:17,898 --> 01:05:18,798
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that song?

920
01:05:18,838 --> 01:05:19,819
[SPEAKER_01]: Room of Angel, I guess it is?

921
01:05:20,099 --> 01:05:23,600
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it has that, and then it has a spoken track on it afterwards.

922
01:05:23,980 --> 01:05:28,782
[SPEAKER_01]: It was some kind of promotional giveaway in Japan, and he has autographed all four CDs.

923
01:05:29,442 --> 01:05:36,404
[SPEAKER_01]: So those who want to get a piece of the man, they are more than welcome to try.

924
01:05:40,405 --> 01:05:42,346
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's see what else is going on.

925
01:05:42,486 --> 01:05:45,447
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's our big giveaway for the time being.

926
01:05:46,667 --> 01:05:50,329
[SPEAKER_01]: There's probably more we might have in the future, but be grateful for what you have.

927
01:05:54,391 --> 01:05:56,392
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is the way the contest is going to work, boys and girls.

928
01:05:56,412 --> 01:06:00,374
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to start this contest on... I've got to bring up the calendar because I forgot.

929
01:06:00,834 --> 01:06:02,535
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not tomorrow, but a week from tomorrow.

930
01:06:02,575 --> 01:06:05,296
[SPEAKER_10]: November 15th is when this contest is going to start.

931
01:06:05,316 --> 01:06:06,396
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to run for two weeks.

932
01:06:06,797 --> 01:06:07,317
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the deal.

933
01:06:08,459 --> 01:06:14,343
[SPEAKER_10]: Monday nights, Tuesday nights, and Thursday nights, Orange Launch Radio has certain spin-off programs.

934
01:06:14,363 --> 01:06:15,084
[SPEAKER_10]: You might have heard of these.

935
01:06:15,144 --> 01:06:20,708
[SPEAKER_10]: Diversion on Mondays, Pump Up the Volume on Tuesday, and Outside the Box moving to Thursday nights this week.

936
01:06:20,748 --> 01:06:25,111
[SPEAKER_10]: So starting on the 15th, on each one of these shows, we're going to ask a trivia question.

937
01:06:25,511 --> 01:06:27,733
[SPEAKER_10]: Something about Akira Yamaoka, something about Silent Hill.

938
01:06:27,773 --> 01:06:30,795
[SPEAKER_10]: It won't be too difficult, but you know, my challenge, you might have to do a little research.

939
01:06:31,355 --> 01:06:33,217
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to ask you a question on each one of these shows.

940
01:06:33,677 --> 01:06:51,753
[SPEAKER_10]: Then, for each week, because we have two CDs, we're going to be doing this for two weeks, at the end of each week, we'll take all the emails with the correct answers, and we'll be drawing one randomly, and whoever gets all the answers correct, and we pull them randomly out of the hat, they win a signed Kiriyama Oka Silent Hill 4 Limited Edition CD.

941
01:06:51,853 --> 01:06:52,794
[SPEAKER_10]: It's imported from Japan.

942
01:06:53,194 --> 01:06:53,734
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.com

943
01:07:18,653 --> 01:07:22,276
[SPEAKER_10]: You're considered a regular and you're not eligible.

944
01:07:22,356 --> 01:07:25,098
[SPEAKER_10]: But a lot of you guys would be eligible to win DDR spots.

945
01:07:26,178 --> 01:07:29,200
[SPEAKER_10]: And vice versa, DDR spot staff could be eligible for ours.

946
01:07:29,841 --> 01:07:30,962
[SPEAKER_10]: So, something to think about.

947
01:07:31,482 --> 01:07:34,284
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, so you got some competition out there that we all want the CDs.

948
01:07:34,624 --> 01:07:35,825
[SPEAKER_10]: I would love to keep them.

949
01:07:35,965 --> 01:07:39,307
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we'll just close the station down tomorrow and I'll just keep them.

950
01:07:40,448 --> 01:07:41,569
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, no, we're going to be doing that.

951
01:07:42,498 --> 01:07:46,201
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's any consolation, even I'm not keeping an autographed CD.

952
01:07:46,241 --> 01:07:48,542
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all, you know, sharing to the people.

953
01:07:49,103 --> 01:07:53,005
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, you know, I have my own autographs of his, but that's neither here nor there.

954
01:07:56,408 --> 01:07:56,688
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

955
01:07:57,849 --> 01:07:58,889
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, I got a big announcement.

956
01:07:58,909 --> 01:08:05,534
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of people in the room don't even know this one yet because we just got the okay on it just a couple hours before you guys all got here.

957
01:08:06,014 --> 01:08:08,056
[SPEAKER_10]: But next week, we're going to have an interview.

958
01:08:08,236 --> 01:08:11,478
[SPEAKER_10]: Our very first Bomani artist is going to be on the show.

959
01:08:12,489 --> 01:08:14,650
[SPEAKER_10]: Conception from DDR Ultramix 2.

960
01:08:14,690 --> 01:08:15,970
[SPEAKER_10]: He did the song Altitude.

961
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:17,091
[SPEAKER_10]: He's going to be on the show next week.

962
01:08:17,551 --> 01:08:18,151
[SPEAKER_10]: So check it out.

963
01:08:18,171 --> 01:08:18,931
[SPEAKER_10]: He's not going to be here live.

964
01:08:18,951 --> 01:08:24,234
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to talk to him over our brand new Skype out thing that we've got where we can call him and we're going to be talking to him.

965
01:08:24,954 --> 01:08:27,295
[SPEAKER_10]: And we might have another one in the next few weeks.

966
01:08:27,975 --> 01:08:28,415
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

967
01:08:28,595 --> 01:08:28,875
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

968
01:08:28,895 --> 01:08:30,456
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if you want to say anything on it or not.

969
01:08:32,728 --> 01:08:42,699
[SPEAKER_10]: We might also have the guy behind the most kick-ass remix in Bomani, in my eyes, the MidiHead remix, MidiHead.

970
01:08:42,759 --> 01:08:45,582
[SPEAKER_10]: We might have MidiHead, so we're working on that.

971
01:08:46,283 --> 01:08:46,803
[SPEAKER_10]: We're working it.

972
01:08:48,485 --> 01:08:50,087
[SPEAKER_10]: This could be the beginning of something beautiful.

973
01:08:51,328 --> 01:08:51,648
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

974
01:08:51,688 --> 01:08:53,430
[SPEAKER_10]: Now I'm looking forward to asking Concepcion a lot of questions.

975
01:08:53,450 --> 01:08:54,632
[SPEAKER_24]: I feel like real radio.

976
01:08:54,732 --> 01:08:55,673
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, it's so weird.

977
01:08:57,284 --> 01:09:01,670
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty soon, you know, we'll outgrow this little apartment studio thing we got going.

978
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:03,072
[SPEAKER_24]: That means we can have a compound.

979
01:09:05,375 --> 01:09:09,741
[SPEAKER_10]: We might have to sell ads on the site because people might actually want to get known out there.

980
01:09:10,522 --> 01:09:11,504
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's definitely interesting.

981
01:09:11,524 --> 01:09:12,906
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to ask Conception a lot.

982
01:09:14,714 --> 01:09:19,797
[SPEAKER_10]: of questions about how he became hooked up with Ultramix 2 and what his music's like.

983
01:09:19,837 --> 01:09:21,618
[SPEAKER_10]: He's actually going to send us a song, too.

984
01:09:22,219 --> 01:09:26,041
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't think a lot of you guys have heard it yet, so we're going to play that for you guys next week on the show.

985
01:09:26,101 --> 01:09:27,742
[SPEAKER_10]: So stay tuned for that.

986
01:09:29,903 --> 01:09:30,423
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

987
01:09:33,405 --> 01:09:34,005
[SPEAKER_10]: What should we do now?

988
01:09:34,025 --> 01:09:35,026
[SPEAKER_10]: Are we going to go to break?

989
01:09:35,406 --> 01:09:35,846
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's do a break.

990
01:09:36,047 --> 01:09:36,507
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys want a break?

991
01:09:36,527 --> 01:09:37,327
[SPEAKER_10]: We can break things.

992
01:09:37,427 --> 01:09:38,008
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, let's do a break.

993
01:09:38,448 --> 01:09:40,269
[SPEAKER_10]: I think... How much longer are you guys going to be here?

994
01:09:41,730 --> 01:09:43,431
[SPEAKER_10]: Another segment, I guess.

995
01:09:43,451 --> 01:09:43,791
[SPEAKER_10]: Another segment?

996
01:09:44,622 --> 01:09:45,182
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe another hour?

997
01:09:45,222 --> 01:09:46,863
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

998
01:09:47,483 --> 01:09:51,704
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see if we can't do some good old-fashioned Bomani match game tonight.

999
01:09:52,384 --> 01:09:52,664
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay?

1000
01:09:53,305 --> 01:09:54,605
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's how it's going to work, though.

1001
01:09:54,625 --> 01:09:56,526
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to get a caller on Skype.

1002
01:09:57,066 --> 01:10:07,589
[SPEAKER_10]: And, of course, what we do when we get somebody on Skype, they will get to challenge either Float Walk, Shark's Girl, Islander, or Iguana Girl, or Navi, or Arcadian 42.

1003
01:10:07,949 --> 01:10:11,390
[SPEAKER_10]: They can pick somebody to challenge on tonight's Bomani match game.

1004
01:10:11,430 --> 01:10:12,331
[SPEAKER_10]: So that should be a lot of fun.

1005
01:10:12,351 --> 01:10:13,111
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys up for it?

1006
01:10:13,511 --> 01:10:13,711
Yeah!

1007
01:10:13,991 --> 01:10:15,372
[SPEAKER_10]: Navi, what's up with 2DX Red?

1008
01:10:15,392 --> 01:10:15,672
[SPEAKER_10]: The game's out?

1009
01:10:15,692 --> 01:10:17,893
[SPEAKER_10]: It came out the day after the site went up.

1010
01:10:41,299 --> 01:10:45,881
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the official, it was like the 27th or 28th of October.

1011
01:10:46,041 --> 01:10:46,382
[SPEAKER_07]: It went up.

1012
01:10:47,602 --> 01:10:47,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

1013
01:10:49,363 --> 01:10:49,703
[SPEAKER_07]: It's out.

1014
01:10:50,063 --> 01:10:50,624
[SPEAKER_07]: What else do you want?

1015
01:10:50,824 --> 01:10:51,544
[SPEAKER_07]: I've had a brain fart.

1016
01:10:52,885 --> 01:10:54,005
[SPEAKER_07]: I bring the microphone to you.

1017
01:10:54,265 --> 01:10:54,886
[SPEAKER_07]: I stalk you.

1018
01:10:55,946 --> 01:10:56,706
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

1019
01:10:57,367 --> 01:10:58,127
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, brain fart.

1020
01:10:58,607 --> 01:10:59,888
[SPEAKER_07]: English, do you speak it?

1021
01:11:00,488 --> 01:11:00,828
[SPEAKER_07]: English.

1022
01:11:01,309 --> 01:11:01,749
[SPEAKER_07]: It's red.

1023
01:11:02,369 --> 01:11:03,209
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very red.

1024
01:11:04,350 --> 01:11:05,210
[SPEAKER_07]: Things about it.

1025
01:11:05,330 --> 01:11:06,891
[SPEAKER_07]: There's, God, it's another 2DX mix.

1026
01:11:07,051 --> 01:11:07,211
[SPEAKER_07]: There's

1027
01:11:09,730 --> 01:11:11,032
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really know what all there is to be said.

1028
01:11:11,072 --> 01:11:14,277
[SPEAKER_16]: You just need to listen to that music.

1029
01:11:17,463 --> 01:11:21,750
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm annoyed at the site right now, though, because there's no artwork for me to download to make my desktop wallpaper.

1030
01:11:25,202 --> 01:11:28,545
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll have you give me inspiration, Loki, then I'll do something intelligent for once.

1031
01:11:28,645 --> 01:11:29,346
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, 2DX Red.

1032
01:11:29,686 --> 01:11:32,449
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, it's the 11th game in the series.

1033
01:11:32,789 --> 01:11:34,130
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got brand new additions.

1034
01:11:34,311 --> 01:11:40,376
[SPEAKER_10]: First off, you've got on the side, while you're playing the game, it's actually showing you progress, basically, kind of like the combo meter in...

1035
01:11:41,357 --> 01:11:47,320
[SPEAKER_10]: Keyboard Mania, so you can see how you're doing versus the max combo in the game.

1036
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:55,844
[SPEAKER_10]: The other thing that's being added to this game is also High Speed 4, which I don't know if that's more of a challenge or helpful, but that's also being added.

1037
01:11:57,505 --> 01:12:02,567
[SPEAKER_10]: Then we've got the addition of, was it 8 plus stars?

1038
01:12:02,587 --> 01:12:07,109
[SPEAKER_07]: They've broken down the ratings into 1 through 8 and Flashing 8s.

1039
01:12:07,189 --> 01:12:10,431
[SPEAKER_07]: Flashing 8s now are just songs like

1040
01:12:11,171 --> 01:12:13,052
[SPEAKER_07]: A and Kakumei, and stuff like that.

1041
01:12:13,892 --> 01:12:15,693
[SPEAKER_07]: There's been plenty of songs that have been upgraded.

1042
01:12:15,733 --> 01:12:23,056
[SPEAKER_07]: Some that I thought were kind of weird to upgrade, like Zero One's now an 8, and Linus is an 8, and a bunch of other crap.

1043
01:12:25,357 --> 01:12:30,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Most of the... A lot of old artists, the regular artists, are not in it.

1044
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:35,482
[SPEAKER_07]: They are off doing other projects right now, so they have revived... A lot of old artists...

1045
01:12:36,161 --> 01:12:41,303
[SPEAKER_07]: like fourth style kind of stuff like... Nobunood or... No, no, no, that was a fake.

1046
01:12:41,723 --> 01:12:42,183
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a fake?

1047
01:12:42,203 --> 01:12:42,703
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a fake.

1048
01:12:44,303 --> 01:12:45,244
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no Superhighway?

1049
01:12:45,264 --> 01:12:46,604
[SPEAKER_07]: No, there's no Superhighway.

1050
01:12:46,624 --> 01:12:48,525
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there was no Voter of Stellum either.

1051
01:12:49,565 --> 01:12:52,066
[SPEAKER_07]: No, they revived Wall 5.

1052
01:12:55,187 --> 01:12:56,187
[SPEAKER_07]: I love their new song.

1053
01:12:57,768 --> 01:13:00,368
[SPEAKER_07]: If you see the new video for it, it's really cool.

1054
01:13:00,388 --> 01:13:02,109
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a bunch of twitching animals to the song.

1055
01:13:05,350 --> 01:13:08,732
[SPEAKER_07]: Baby Weapon, DJ Swan from 5th Style.

1056
01:13:09,833 --> 01:13:16,916
[SPEAKER_07]: There's actually a handful of artists that, you know, like, when the 2DX, when the remix album for 10th Style came out, we're all, who the fuck are they?

1057
01:13:16,956 --> 01:13:19,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, now they have their own songs in here.

1058
01:13:19,878 --> 01:13:25,381
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ 19, DJ Tomo, I think DJ Yoshitaka was one of the ones that was on the 10th Style remix album also.

1059
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:28,142
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm glad to see Ryu doing something other than happy hardcore.

1060
01:13:28,382 --> 01:13:30,884
[SPEAKER_07]: His new song isn't as great as they were in 10th Style.

1061
01:13:30,964 --> 01:13:31,444
[SPEAKER_07]: I like it.

1062
01:13:32,024 --> 01:13:34,545
[SPEAKER_34]: I forget what his song was though, but it wasn't... Be Quiet.

1063
01:13:35,125 --> 01:13:35,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Be Quiet.

1064
01:13:35,765 --> 01:13:37,266
[SPEAKER_07]: I love that song, it's awesome.

1065
01:13:37,726 --> 01:13:43,468
[SPEAKER_07]: I love that, um... God, um, I can't understand what the fuck Paul Terry is saying.

1066
01:13:43,928 --> 01:13:47,389
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, she sucks, again.

1067
01:13:47,529 --> 01:13:51,871
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, she's only good with, um, um, um, um... What's her name?

1068
01:13:51,931 --> 01:13:53,311
[SPEAKER_10]: What's the guy's name?

1069
01:13:53,371 --> 01:13:56,272
[SPEAKER_24]: Is she out of key, as usual?

1070
01:13:56,452 --> 01:13:57,233
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know what's really weird?

1071
01:13:57,253 --> 01:13:58,253
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, like, anything...

1072
01:14:00,555 --> 01:14:00,975
[SPEAKER_24]: Red Zone

1073
01:14:22,748 --> 01:14:23,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you heard it?

1074
01:14:24,629 --> 01:14:29,830
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Tatch and Naoki, and it sounds like some really old DDR song.

1075
01:14:29,890 --> 01:14:37,773
[SPEAKER_10]: Naoki, I mean, he needs to just go under another alias and just stay under that alias and never, ever, ever, ever go back to Naoki again.

1076
01:14:38,153 --> 01:14:43,134
[SPEAKER_10]: Because, honestly, I mean, I like Euro... No, I don't like Eurobeat.

1077
01:14:43,154 --> 01:14:44,535
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not going to try to lie there.

1078
01:14:46,876 --> 01:14:50,918
[SPEAKER_10]: No, stuff like B4U, Brilliant to You and stuff, that was good back then.

1079
01:14:50,938 --> 01:14:52,139
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what Red Zone sounds like.

1080
01:14:52,359 --> 01:14:56,741
[SPEAKER_10]: Stop making the same damn song over and over and calling it something different.

1081
01:14:56,761 --> 01:15:02,244
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's really funny that Red Zone sounds like that, but he's in collaboration with a new sound producer.

1082
01:15:03,085 --> 01:15:07,847
[SPEAKER_07]: Slake is no longer a sound producer on this, but apparently he's got three songs in the mix already.

1083
01:15:08,608 --> 01:15:09,828
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, uh...

1084
01:15:11,309 --> 01:15:23,034
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, as like old artists that are no longer with the mix, this current mix right now, we will not be seeing Mr. T, Tak, Shoichiro Hirata, huh?

1085
01:15:24,995 --> 01:15:25,655
[SPEAKER_07]: God, I'm forgetting.

1086
01:15:26,555 --> 01:15:30,577
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a ton of them that just, that aren't in there, or at least aren't in there yet.

1087
01:15:31,637 --> 01:15:36,980
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, was any of the artists that, what was it, from like, I think it was from like 9th style,

1088
01:15:38,536 --> 01:15:40,638
[SPEAKER_10]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1089
01:15:59,894 --> 01:16:04,216
[SPEAKER_07]: One of them is Tayo, and the other one is D-A-N-C-E.

1090
01:16:05,197 --> 01:16:08,398
[SPEAKER_10]: What the hell is up with a guy being in B4U?

1091
01:16:08,418 --> 01:16:09,358
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I want to know.

1092
01:16:10,259 --> 01:16:15,301
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you gotta either feel sorry for him, or he's the luckiest bastard in the world.

1093
01:16:15,321 --> 01:16:17,562
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you talking about?

1094
01:16:17,582 --> 01:16:19,402
[SPEAKER_10]: There is a guy in the group B4U.

1095
01:16:19,422 --> 01:16:20,503
[SPEAKER_07]: There is not a guy in B4U.

1096
01:16:21,323 --> 01:16:22,143
[SPEAKER_10]: There is a guy!

1097
01:16:22,303 --> 01:16:23,543
[SPEAKER_10]: I swear to God it's a guy!

1098
01:16:23,723 --> 01:16:27,424
[SPEAKER_07]: You want me to point it out?

1099
01:16:27,724 --> 01:16:28,264
[SPEAKER_34]: Show me the guy!

1100
01:16:29,264 --> 01:16:29,985
[SPEAKER_07]: Show me the guy!

1101
01:16:30,105 --> 01:16:33,685
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to see this!

1102
01:16:33,705 --> 01:16:37,066
[SPEAKER_07]: There were five people that won the Bimani Vocal Audition.

1103
01:16:37,486 --> 01:16:44,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Three of them are now members of B4U, and one of them was the chick that has the two songs in 2DX right now, and another one is a guy.

1104
01:16:44,767 --> 01:16:47,648
[SPEAKER_07]: He has not had any songs that I know of yet.

1105
01:16:48,528 --> 01:16:49,368
[SPEAKER_07]: And where are you going?

1106
01:16:52,421 --> 01:16:54,182
[SPEAKER_07]: This is your high quality radio right here.

1107
01:16:54,222 --> 01:16:54,743
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, go to Konami.

1108
01:16:54,803 --> 01:16:56,324
[SPEAKER_07]: You talk, I'll get there.

1109
01:17:16,397 --> 01:17:22,601
[SPEAKER_24]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1110
01:17:45,757 --> 01:17:54,005
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a key, key, essay, key, I believe is the name of the song, by B4U, and the new Orange Lounge song, and I'm going to try and say this with my French accent.

1111
01:17:54,625 --> 01:17:56,027
[SPEAKER_10]: Les fillets, bon accès.

1112
01:17:56,087 --> 01:17:59,110
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me read it, I'll say it.

1113
01:17:59,190 --> 01:18:01,392
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Shark Skrulls are going to be going, I know French, let me read it.

1114
01:18:02,573 --> 01:18:03,914
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll try to get her over here after the break.

1115
01:18:04,475 --> 01:18:07,177
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, we're going to go to this break, we will be right back.

1116
01:18:07,217 --> 01:18:07,618
[SPEAKER_10]: Have a good one.

1117
01:19:04,025 --> 01:19:04,586
Thanks for watching!

1118
01:20:20,237 --> 01:20:20,701
Thank you.

1119
01:22:18,939 --> 01:22:19,681
DarkSakura

1120
01:23:17,160 --> 01:23:18,168
Thanks for watching!

1121
01:24:03,365 --> 01:24:08,232
[SPEAKER_16]: From StepSquad to Orange Lab, this PDR sucks!

1122
01:24:08,292 --> 01:24:11,497
[SPEAKER_16]: Holler, holler, holler, holler, holler, holler, holler!

1123
01:24:17,386 --> 01:24:19,526
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

1124
01:24:19,546 --> 01:24:21,607
[SPEAKER_00]: Yay, Step Squad.

1125
01:24:21,687 --> 01:24:23,447
[SPEAKER_00]: I love everyone.

1126
01:24:23,467 --> 01:24:24,527
[SPEAKER_00]: Step Squad.

1127
01:24:24,707 --> 01:24:27,748
[SPEAKER_10]: We have several little DDR factions in house.

1128
01:24:27,768 --> 01:24:29,288
[SPEAKER_10]: We have representation from RTF.

1129
01:24:29,888 --> 01:24:31,709
[SPEAKER_10]: We have representation from Step Squad.

1130
01:24:32,249 --> 01:24:34,589
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have representation from the Nobodies.

1131
01:24:34,689 --> 01:24:35,070
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1132
01:24:36,070 --> 01:24:36,930
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, DarkSkull.

1133
01:24:37,170 --> 01:24:38,230
[SPEAKER_09]: Big fat Nobodies.

1134
01:24:38,550 --> 01:24:39,890
[SPEAKER_09]: BFN for life.

1135
01:24:40,331 --> 01:24:41,051
[SPEAKER_09]: For real.

1136
01:24:44,167 --> 01:24:45,827
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm representing Heaven's Gate.

1137
01:24:46,007 --> 01:24:47,508
[SPEAKER_10]: I just forgot to drink the Kool-Aid.

1138
01:24:48,908 --> 01:24:51,329
[SPEAKER_10]: I think a new DDR squad has just been born.

1139
01:24:52,129 --> 01:24:53,449
[SPEAKER_10]: BFN, Big Fat Nothing.

1140
01:24:53,529 --> 01:24:54,350
[SPEAKER_10]: Is this our gang sign?

1141
01:24:54,370 --> 01:24:54,750
[SPEAKER_10]: What is this?

1142
01:24:55,030 --> 01:24:55,830
[SPEAKER_10]: Why do we keep doing this?

1143
01:24:55,870 --> 01:24:59,091
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1144
01:25:00,631 --> 01:25:02,752
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, Navi, want to be in BFN?

1145
01:25:03,492 --> 01:25:04,192
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah!

1146
01:25:04,492 --> 01:25:04,912
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah!

1147
01:25:05,252 --> 01:25:05,512
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1148
01:25:08,213 --> 01:25:10,433
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, BFN should be that, Big Fat Nothing.

1149
01:25:11,494 --> 01:25:11,954
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1150
01:25:13,591 --> 01:25:15,513
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll be taking applications a little later.

1151
01:25:16,033 --> 01:25:16,334
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1152
01:25:18,235 --> 01:25:18,936
[SPEAKER_10]: That's BFL.

1153
01:25:19,036 --> 01:25:23,200
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a little different.

1154
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:25,822
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, a few people said I was in the GFR squad.

1155
01:25:28,585 --> 01:25:34,470
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, so speaking of GFR, did you get this guy in B4U situation sorted out?

1156
01:25:36,974 --> 01:25:42,097
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, yes, yes, it's not B4U, but he's just some ugly guy that's in a picture with B4U people.

1157
01:25:42,998 --> 01:25:52,404
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways, it's this guy named Reija Sakurai, and looks like, I don't know, he's going to be singing something for some Bomani game.

1158
01:25:53,384 --> 01:25:54,064
[SPEAKER_10]: Poor bastard.

1159
01:25:54,425 --> 01:25:59,468
[SPEAKER_10]: He could very well be in the... And he'll be giving head at Vellfire.

1160
01:26:01,369 --> 01:26:04,991
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, I wouldn't be surprised if he's in one of the CS songs for Poppin' Music.

1161
01:26:09,866 --> 01:26:10,687
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1162
01:26:10,967 --> 01:26:15,031
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to segue for about 30 seconds here to give you your In The Groove update.

1163
01:26:15,711 --> 01:26:18,353
[SPEAKER_10]: Because everybody's got to know.

1164
01:26:19,014 --> 01:26:22,217
[SPEAKER_10]: This Halloween, to celebrate Halloween, they have an Unlocked song.

1165
01:26:22,337 --> 01:26:30,884
[SPEAKER_10]: Anubis, the god of death, and Florida, as if you need another reason not to go to Florida, just got In The Groove.

1166
01:26:32,305 --> 01:26:32,565
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all.

1167
01:26:37,842 --> 01:26:38,542
[SPEAKER_22]: What part of Florida?

1168
01:26:39,402 --> 01:26:39,683
[SPEAKER_22]: What city?

1169
01:26:39,703 --> 01:26:42,404
[SPEAKER_22]: The back part, I don't know.

1170
01:26:42,484 --> 01:26:48,548
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, it's just because I'm going to be, you know, not an hour away from Pensacola.

1171
01:26:50,068 --> 01:26:52,830
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, at the end of the month, I'm going to be an hour away from Pensacola.

1172
01:26:55,611 --> 01:26:58,093
[SPEAKER_10]: And that, ladies and gentlemen, was your In the Groove update.

1173
01:27:01,149 --> 01:27:01,649
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1174
01:27:04,791 --> 01:27:05,891
[SPEAKER_10]: We're so mean to them.

1175
01:27:06,311 --> 01:27:13,374
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, seriously, there's a point where... I feel bad because I did give a review and there are some good things about the game.

1176
01:27:13,715 --> 01:27:13,955
[SPEAKER_10]: Some.

1177
01:27:14,555 --> 01:27:15,355
[SPEAKER_10]: Very few, but some.

1178
01:27:15,595 --> 01:27:15,855
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1179
01:27:16,936 --> 01:27:18,156
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, yeah, it's not DDR King.

1180
01:27:18,537 --> 01:27:19,097
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, anyway.

1181
01:27:21,306 --> 01:27:22,848
[SPEAKER_10]: We actually have a special guest.

1182
01:27:22,868 --> 01:27:28,672
[SPEAKER_10]: Somebody actually messaged me on Skype and said that they wanted to come in and talk to us for just a second.

1183
01:27:28,712 --> 01:27:30,233
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a very special guest.

1184
01:27:30,473 --> 01:27:32,694
[SPEAKER_10]: I know at least one person in this room is going to get a kick out of this.

1185
01:27:32,714 --> 01:27:35,196
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm actually going to give him a buzz right now.

1186
01:27:35,216 --> 01:27:36,637
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see if we can get him on the line here.

1187
01:27:39,940 --> 01:27:40,420
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello?

1188
01:27:40,860 --> 01:27:42,621
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, is this Travis?

1189
01:27:44,363 --> 01:27:44,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Who?

1190
01:27:46,684 --> 01:27:47,425
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, Travis...

1191
01:27:49,505 --> 01:27:49,825
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1192
01:27:50,205 --> 01:27:50,545
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi.

1193
01:27:50,705 --> 01:27:51,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.

1194
01:27:52,646 --> 01:27:53,286
[SPEAKER_10]: How are you?

1195
01:27:54,006 --> 01:27:54,407
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm good.

1196
01:27:54,467 --> 01:27:55,187
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you guys?

1197
01:27:55,407 --> 01:27:55,767
[SPEAKER_10]: Good.

1198
01:27:56,167 --> 01:28:02,269
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought maybe you'd want to say hello because this is the first time Iguana Girl and I have been on the air together since Under Station Live.

1199
01:28:03,509 --> 01:28:07,671
[SPEAKER_06]: And with everything that's happened in the last couple weeks, this is proof Armageddon is here.

1200
01:28:08,311 --> 01:28:10,712
[SPEAKER_19]: That's Travis.

1201
01:28:10,852 --> 01:28:11,812
[SPEAKER_19]: Travis, I miss you.

1202
01:28:11,872 --> 01:28:12,492
[SPEAKER_19]: I love you.

1203
01:28:13,372 --> 01:28:15,013
[SPEAKER_10]: And you're looking good, baby.

1204
01:28:16,019 --> 01:28:17,601
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, he's stalking you on our webcam right now.

1205
01:28:17,942 --> 01:28:19,223
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey, hey, 40 pounds lost, baby.

1206
01:28:20,405 --> 01:28:21,826
[SPEAKER_10]: Looking good.

1207
01:28:23,509 --> 01:28:25,050
[SPEAKER_10]: Put your pants back on, Travis, please.

1208
01:28:25,952 --> 01:28:26,953
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't think Jenna would like that.

1209
01:28:27,053 --> 01:28:27,253
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.

1210
01:28:27,974 --> 01:28:29,155
[SPEAKER_10]: I like doing it in my pants.

1211
01:28:32,199 --> 01:28:34,302
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, Travis, do you have anything you want to plug?

1212
01:28:35,382 --> 01:28:39,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh geez, is this, is this, okay, let's talk, I'm gonna get him off the air.

1213
01:28:39,684 --> 01:28:42,705
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm just, I'm just asking the logical follow-up question, is there anything else?

1214
01:28:42,725 --> 01:28:45,786
[SPEAKER_19]: No, the logical follow-up question would be, what does he want to plug?

1215
01:28:47,106 --> 01:28:47,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Your butt?

1216
01:28:50,767 --> 01:28:52,148
[SPEAKER_06]: I really have nothing to plug.

1217
01:28:53,028 --> 01:28:53,829
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing to plug?

1218
01:28:54,229 --> 01:28:55,029
[SPEAKER_22]: We already plugged you.

1219
01:28:56,750 --> 01:28:58,050
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not the first time that happened.

1220
01:29:01,651 --> 01:29:02,111
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1221
01:29:02,292 --> 01:29:03,572
[SPEAKER_06]: What's going on with Understation Live?

1222
01:29:04,787 --> 01:29:05,927
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a damn thing.

1223
01:29:07,107 --> 01:29:10,048
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's why I wanted to give you a chance to plug it so folks can go listen to it.

1224
01:29:10,668 --> 01:29:10,928
[SPEAKER_09]: Why?

1225
01:29:14,129 --> 01:29:15,209
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't even listen to it.

1226
01:29:17,630 --> 01:29:18,950
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't even do the show.

1227
01:29:19,850 --> 01:29:20,770
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't do the show anymore?

1228
01:29:22,511 --> 01:29:24,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if that's what you call wasting a Saturday.

1229
01:29:25,391 --> 01:29:27,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I thought that's what you... That's what we always used to do.

1230
01:29:28,452 --> 01:29:28,672
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.

1231
01:29:28,712 --> 01:29:30,852
[SPEAKER_10]: What's changed since Jessica and I were on there?

1232
01:29:30,872 --> 01:29:32,112
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called a baby.

1233
01:29:33,013 --> 01:29:33,193
[SPEAKER_10]: Aww.

1234
01:29:33,953 --> 01:29:34,173
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

1235
01:29:34,193 --> 01:29:34,433
[SPEAKER_10]: Kira.

1236
01:29:35,933 --> 01:29:36,693
[SPEAKER_10]: How is the baby doing?

1237
01:29:37,654 --> 01:29:38,474
[SPEAKER_06]: She's a little shit.

1238
01:29:40,115 --> 01:29:41,716
[SPEAKER_19]: I bet she makes a lot of little shits, too.

1239
01:29:42,696 --> 01:29:43,576
[SPEAKER_06]: No, she makes big shit.

1240
01:29:44,777 --> 01:29:47,038
[SPEAKER_06]: Big, stinky, chunky shit.

1241
01:29:47,458 --> 01:29:50,800
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you going to get her to play DDR?

1242
01:29:53,061 --> 01:29:55,802
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, in your wildest dreams, boy.

1243
01:29:57,522 --> 01:30:01,024
[SPEAKER_02]: I still love that Too Unlimited video you did.

1244
01:30:02,325 --> 01:30:05,346
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually just watched it just the other day.

1245
01:30:07,219 --> 01:30:14,524
[SPEAKER_06]: I had been working on others, but my job unfortunately takes so much time away from me, I don't even have time to sit down and update my live journal.

1246
01:30:16,145 --> 01:30:16,806
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, we noticed.

1247
01:30:17,966 --> 01:30:20,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1248
01:30:20,688 --> 01:30:22,650
[SPEAKER_06]: But how are things on the left coast?

1249
01:30:25,011 --> 01:30:25,772
[SPEAKER_10]: Left as always.

1250
01:30:25,952 --> 01:30:26,392
[SPEAKER_10]: It's good.

1251
01:30:27,833 --> 01:30:28,734
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1252
01:30:28,874 --> 01:30:29,234
[SPEAKER_10]: Sunny?

1253
01:30:29,694 --> 01:30:30,115
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1254
01:30:31,434 --> 01:30:31,954
[SPEAKER_19]: Rainy.

1255
01:30:32,615 --> 01:30:32,995
[SPEAKER_10]: Angry.

1256
01:30:33,396 --> 01:30:34,276
[SPEAKER_09]: Cracking up.

1257
01:30:34,797 --> 01:30:35,637
[SPEAKER_09]: Sad.

1258
01:30:36,258 --> 01:30:36,798
[SPEAKER_09]: Sad.

1259
01:30:38,199 --> 01:30:38,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Mad.

1260
01:30:39,340 --> 01:30:41,982
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, actually, let me ask Rob this.

1261
01:30:42,042 --> 01:30:45,805
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you feel about yourself, you, Rob, running for public office?

1262
01:30:46,866 --> 01:30:47,826
[SPEAKER_10]: I've contemplated it.

1263
01:30:47,886 --> 01:30:48,687
[SPEAKER_10]: I seriously have.

1264
01:30:48,767 --> 01:30:54,972
[SPEAKER_10]: But I just don't think, because kids don't vote, the youth doesn't vote, I think if I were to run, I would have to get the youth vote connection.

1265
01:30:55,032 --> 01:30:58,154
[SPEAKER_10]: And in this area, which has a bunch of retired citizens, that ain't going to happen.

1266
01:30:58,935 --> 01:31:00,556
[SPEAKER_10]: I've given it serious thought in the past, though.

1267
01:31:01,095 --> 01:31:02,775
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, have I got news for you.

1268
01:31:02,995 --> 01:31:03,436
[SPEAKER_10]: What's that?

1269
01:31:04,536 --> 01:31:05,736
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, is everybody sitting down?

1270
01:31:06,076 --> 01:31:06,356
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1271
01:31:07,617 --> 01:31:08,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody got their towel?

1272
01:31:09,157 --> 01:31:09,517
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1273
01:31:10,297 --> 01:31:11,438
[SPEAKER_17]: Don't forget your towel.

1274
01:31:13,158 --> 01:31:13,978
[SPEAKER_10]: I have an announcement.

1275
01:31:14,918 --> 01:31:15,259
[SPEAKER_10]: What's this?

1276
01:31:16,159 --> 01:31:17,619
[SPEAKER_10]: As I talk really close to the mic.

1277
01:31:17,739 --> 01:31:19,200
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, well we can hear you just fine.

1278
01:31:19,780 --> 01:31:20,780
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so everybody shut up.

1279
01:31:26,981 --> 01:31:28,802
[SPEAKER_06]: Seeing what has happened in the last two weeks...

1280
01:31:29,753 --> 01:31:39,936
[SPEAKER_06]: With the election, a country divided, one side against another, people burning down houses, cars, accosting people.

1281
01:31:40,797 --> 01:31:43,577
[SPEAKER_06]: Half the country likes one person, half the country likes the other person.

1282
01:31:44,058 --> 01:31:45,398
[SPEAKER_06]: I've decided to take a stand.

1283
01:31:47,119 --> 01:31:53,841
[SPEAKER_06]: I, Travis Donovan, officially announce my candidacy for President of the United States in 2008.

1284
01:31:56,832 --> 01:31:59,513
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, Travis, wait, wait, wait, wait, Travis, Travis.

1285
01:32:00,133 --> 01:32:02,334
[SPEAKER_06]: Hang on, just make me stop the music.

1286
01:32:05,236 --> 01:32:07,917
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not going to be 35 by then.

1287
01:32:08,677 --> 01:32:11,199
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to be 35 at the time of the inauguration.

1288
01:32:15,641 --> 01:32:17,982
[SPEAKER_06]: Birth certificates can be altered by a month.

1289
01:32:20,894 --> 01:32:26,779
[SPEAKER_06]: I have decided I am running for president, and if that doesn't work, I'm running for governor of Texas in 06.

1290
01:32:30,202 --> 01:32:31,503
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, thank you.

1291
01:32:32,443 --> 01:32:33,825
[SPEAKER_06]: Hang on, hang on.

1292
01:32:34,325 --> 01:32:35,406
[SPEAKER_06]: I got my crowd here too.

1293
01:32:37,988 --> 01:32:38,448
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.

1294
01:32:38,508 --> 01:32:40,970
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you do realize what this means.

1295
01:32:41,971 --> 01:32:43,032
[SPEAKER_10]: Now I have to run.

1296
01:32:44,573 --> 01:32:45,954
[SPEAKER_10]: Far, far away.

1297
01:32:45,994 --> 01:32:46,595
[SPEAKER_10]: Far, far away.

1298
01:32:47,625 --> 01:32:48,005
[SPEAKER_10]: Damn it!

1299
01:32:48,226 --> 01:32:54,091
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just put that whole rant in my live journal about how I wasn't going to move to Canada, but now I'm reconsidering.

1300
01:32:54,772 --> 01:32:57,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I have two propositions for you on that.

1301
01:32:58,496 --> 01:32:59,997
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you going to legalize gay marriage?

1302
01:33:01,979 --> 01:33:02,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's not go there yet.

1303
01:33:03,661 --> 01:33:07,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Because after all, I'm the working man for the working people.

1304
01:33:08,665 --> 01:33:09,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1305
01:33:09,406 --> 01:33:09,827
[SPEAKER_06]: I work.

1306
01:33:10,487 --> 01:33:10,808
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1307
01:33:12,623 --> 01:33:14,043
[SPEAKER_06]: No, here's my propositions for you, Rob.

1308
01:33:14,203 --> 01:33:14,483
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1309
01:33:15,124 --> 01:33:16,024
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm running for president.

1310
01:33:16,124 --> 01:33:16,424
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1311
01:33:16,984 --> 01:33:19,304
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna need a vice presidential candidate.

1312
01:33:19,665 --> 01:33:19,985
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1313
01:33:21,205 --> 01:33:21,845
[SPEAKER_06]: You're it, Rob.

1314
01:33:22,345 --> 01:33:23,225
[SPEAKER_06]: Woohoo!

1315
01:33:25,026 --> 01:33:26,026
[SPEAKER_09]: I am so there.

1316
01:33:26,066 --> 01:33:28,146
[SPEAKER_09]: But wait a minute, you're a Republican and I'm a Democrat.

1317
01:33:28,186 --> 01:33:29,367
[SPEAKER_09]: Could that ever possibly work?

1318
01:33:31,567 --> 01:33:32,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and your point?

1319
01:33:32,667 --> 01:33:33,247
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we'll find out.

1320
01:33:33,287 --> 01:33:33,567
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

1321
01:33:33,587 --> 01:33:34,428
[SPEAKER_24]: You know what?

1322
01:33:34,728 --> 01:33:36,408
[SPEAKER_24]: This is a perfect opportunity.

1323
01:33:36,468 --> 01:33:40,849
[SPEAKER_24]: Like, I've been ranting about it in my live journal to throw away the stupid bipartisan bullshit.

1324
01:33:41,417 --> 01:33:41,837
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

1325
01:33:42,498 --> 01:33:44,039
[SPEAKER_09]: Travis and I can come together.

1326
01:33:44,059 --> 01:33:45,420
[SPEAKER_24]: Abandon the party mindset.

1327
01:33:45,661 --> 01:33:47,122
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't want to hear that.

1328
01:33:47,822 --> 01:33:49,784
[SPEAKER_06]: If we can come on each other, we can come together.

1329
01:33:50,224 --> 01:33:54,548
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, you're making a Guana girl sad because she doesn't know what she's going to do.

1330
01:33:55,228 --> 01:33:56,490
[SPEAKER_10]: She doesn't get to be vice president.

1331
01:33:56,590 --> 01:33:57,170
[SPEAKER_10]: What can she do?

1332
01:33:59,712 --> 01:34:02,034
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's fire Condoleezza Rice and put Jess in there.

1333
01:34:02,575 --> 01:34:02,795
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

1334
01:34:03,175 --> 01:34:03,395
[SPEAKER_10]: No?

1335
01:34:04,136 --> 01:34:04,776
[SPEAKER_10]: What does she get to do?

1336
01:34:05,897 --> 01:34:08,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I don't want to... I get to stand around and have big boobs?

1337
01:34:09,360 --> 01:34:09,680
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I...

1338
01:34:11,007 --> 01:34:11,867
[SPEAKER_06]: Secretary of Big Boobs.

1339
01:34:11,887 --> 01:34:14,188
[SPEAKER_06]: There's an idea.

1340
01:34:15,208 --> 01:34:16,369
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I actually gave that some thought.

1341
01:34:16,469 --> 01:34:18,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Jess can be Secretary of Agriculture.

1342
01:34:22,251 --> 01:34:24,892
[SPEAKER_00]: So long as I get to play with the cows.

1343
01:34:25,512 --> 01:34:28,213
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to be the Secretary of Agriculture.

1344
01:34:29,893 --> 01:34:34,955
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I figure you want a woman who PMSs as far down on the chain of succession as possible.

1345
01:34:41,411 --> 01:34:42,872
[SPEAKER_19]: I haven't calmed down at all.

1346
01:34:43,952 --> 01:34:45,213
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just zoning you, Travis.

1347
01:34:46,273 --> 01:34:48,254
[SPEAKER_10]: Now great, you just lost us a vote.

1348
01:34:48,354 --> 01:34:48,914
[SPEAKER_10]: Way to go.

1349
01:34:51,055 --> 01:34:51,916
[SPEAKER_06]: Way to go, Trav.

1350
01:34:53,116 --> 01:34:54,897
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't say everybody was gonna like us.

1351
01:34:56,558 --> 01:34:57,918
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm honest and upfront about it.

1352
01:34:58,019 --> 01:35:00,960
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna be plain spoken for the plain spoken people.

1353
01:35:01,560 --> 01:35:04,281
[SPEAKER_06]: I will have no problem telling candidates to shut the fuck up.

1354
01:35:06,607 --> 01:35:13,011
[SPEAKER_06]: I will have no problems pointing out that my running mate is gay.

1355
01:35:15,152 --> 01:35:18,114
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't need the other candidates to tell me this, I've known this.

1356
01:35:19,775 --> 01:35:20,515
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm here!

1357
01:35:22,497 --> 01:35:26,059
[SPEAKER_06]: What was the point of John Kerry pointing out to Dick Cheney that his daughter was gay?

1358
01:35:26,339 --> 01:35:27,800
[SPEAKER_06]: No shit, I think he knows!

1359
01:35:30,937 --> 01:35:33,538
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, that was Edwards that did that, but yeah.

1360
01:35:33,598 --> 01:35:38,320
[SPEAKER_06]: Were you expecting him to have a revelation and a heart attack right then and there going, Jesus, she's gay!

1361
01:35:40,061 --> 01:35:44,182
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think so.

1362
01:35:44,262 --> 01:35:45,783
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm seriously considering this.

1363
01:35:46,263 --> 01:35:47,704
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a grassroots campaign.

1364
01:35:48,044 --> 01:35:49,885
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a third party kind of thing.

1365
01:35:49,905 --> 01:35:51,545
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we have to come up with a name for the third party.

1366
01:35:53,026 --> 01:35:53,906
[SPEAKER_06]: The People's Party!

1367
01:35:54,026 --> 01:35:55,027
[SPEAKER_06]: The People Party!

1368
01:35:55,607 --> 01:35:55,887
[SPEAKER_10]: I like that.

1369
01:35:56,385 --> 01:36:01,507
[SPEAKER_06]: and if anybody can access the social... It could be the house party.

1370
01:36:03,327 --> 01:36:05,028
[SPEAKER_06]: Travis and Rob's house party!

1371
01:36:05,088 --> 01:36:05,968
[SPEAKER_06]: All the best!

1372
01:36:07,329 --> 01:36:07,789
[SPEAKER_10]: I like it.

1373
01:36:08,149 --> 01:36:09,270
[SPEAKER_06]: Totally live!

1374
01:36:09,370 --> 01:36:13,711
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we're going to have to get my people in touch with your people and people things.

1375
01:36:14,311 --> 01:36:15,172
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't see that happening.

1376
01:36:17,272 --> 01:36:24,335
[SPEAKER_06]: You think I'm all crazy because I live out here in Texas because, oh, I'm sorry, as people have pointed out in this last week, I'm a redneck because I live in Texas.

1377
01:36:25,222 --> 01:36:29,785
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I don't think you're a redneck.

1378
01:36:32,826 --> 01:36:35,828
[SPEAKER_06]: As people pointed out, now it's time for the South to secede.

1379
01:36:37,809 --> 01:36:40,090
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, the rest of us are going to form the United States of Canada.

1380
01:36:40,150 --> 01:36:41,211
[SPEAKER_10]: Ha ha ha, you're right.

1381
01:36:41,411 --> 01:36:43,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, this is my second condition.

1382
01:36:44,132 --> 01:36:49,595
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're serious about going to Canada, along with all these other people who want to leave the country... Of which I am not.

1383
01:36:49,735 --> 01:36:50,736
[SPEAKER_10]: I would never leave to Canada.

1384
01:36:51,332 --> 01:37:18,799
[SPEAKER_10]: if you were to sign a legal binding document that you will get your ass out and never come back I will personally start donating to the U-Haul truck to get you the fuck out and I will use big bills as I've said before just because the guy I did not vote for and did not want to win won that does not mean I hide my tail behind my legs and go to Canada that just means I have to yell a little louder

1385
01:37:19,289 --> 01:37:20,750
[SPEAKER_10]: No, you just sit there and bitch and whine.

1386
01:37:20,970 --> 01:37:22,291
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly, that's what we do.

1387
01:37:22,631 --> 01:37:23,591
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the American way!

1388
01:37:24,152 --> 01:37:24,852
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn straight!

1389
01:37:25,733 --> 01:37:26,973
[SPEAKER_06]: America, fuck yeah!

1390
01:37:27,233 --> 01:37:29,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly, exactly.

1391
01:37:30,035 --> 01:37:33,377
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but my question was, did you... Sorry.

1392
01:37:33,757 --> 01:37:40,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you expect, Rob, on the next day, Wednesday, to see a big, gloating thing in my live journal?

1393
01:37:41,761 --> 01:37:42,282
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, no.

1394
01:37:43,522 --> 01:37:43,923
[SPEAKER_10]: Why?

1395
01:37:44,003 --> 01:37:46,324
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I think everybody knows that kind of stuff's in poor taste.

1396
01:37:48,110 --> 01:37:50,232
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, not a lot of people in LiveJournal did.

1397
01:37:50,632 --> 01:37:52,313
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't really see a whole lot of gloating.

1398
01:37:52,333 --> 01:37:54,474
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, if anybody... I'm not talking about gloating.

1399
01:37:54,774 --> 01:37:59,798
[SPEAKER_10]: Most of the people I knew, if they gloated, I could have said, well, California went blue, so... But, you know.

1400
01:38:00,958 --> 01:38:01,879
[SPEAKER_10]: But, I mean, it doesn't matter.

1401
01:38:02,079 --> 01:38:05,421
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it happens, so... Only half of California went blue.

1402
01:38:06,982 --> 01:38:07,403
[SPEAKER_10]: 55% went blue.

1403
01:38:07,503 --> 01:38:07,803
[SPEAKER_10]: Get it right.

1404
01:38:08,343 --> 01:38:09,604
[SPEAKER_06]: That's half of California.

1405
01:38:09,944 --> 01:38:11,325
[SPEAKER_10]: Only 44% went red.

1406
01:38:11,426 --> 01:38:12,406
[SPEAKER_10]: Just FYI.

1407
01:38:12,566 --> 01:38:12,847
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway.

1408
01:38:12,867 --> 01:38:15,649
[SPEAKER_24]: We don't need to discount the over 4 million popular votes.

1409
01:38:16,389 --> 01:38:16,710
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway.

1410
01:38:17,090 --> 01:38:17,550
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyway.

1411
01:38:18,151 --> 01:38:19,472
[SPEAKER_10]: Can't we all just get along?

1412
01:38:19,772 --> 01:38:20,733
[SPEAKER_10]: Can't we all just get along?

1413
01:38:21,553 --> 01:38:21,793
[SPEAKER_24]: No.

1414
01:38:21,813 --> 01:38:24,636
[SPEAKER_24]: Can't we all just forget about bipartisan shit?

1415
01:38:24,656 --> 01:38:27,318
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's just have a bipartisan orgy and be done with it.

1416
01:38:27,938 --> 01:38:28,178
[SPEAKER_24]: No.

1417
01:38:28,599 --> 01:38:29,419
[SPEAKER_24]: Get rid of it.

1418
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:32,882
[SPEAKER_24]: Get rid of the electoral college and parties.

1419
01:38:33,062 --> 01:38:33,362
[SPEAKER_24]: Uh-uh.

1420
01:38:33,502 --> 01:38:33,682
[SPEAKER_24]: No.

1421
01:38:33,783 --> 01:38:34,103
[SPEAKER_24]: Stupid.

1422
01:38:34,123 --> 01:38:34,243
[SPEAKER_24]: Stupid.

1423
01:38:35,009 --> 01:38:36,830
[SPEAKER_06]: No, the electoral college is not stupid.

1424
01:38:36,850 --> 01:38:41,311
[SPEAKER_06]: I've had this debate with you guys back in 2000, and I'm going to have it over and over again.

1425
01:38:41,691 --> 01:38:44,952
[SPEAKER_06]: It gives the small counties with the less population... Alright, alright.

1426
01:38:45,092 --> 01:38:46,472
[SPEAKER_10]: You're not having that debate on this show.

1427
01:38:46,612 --> 01:38:49,053
[SPEAKER_10]: We have stupid 12-year-old games to be talking about.

1428
01:38:49,313 --> 01:38:49,633
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay?

1429
01:38:51,473 --> 01:38:52,994
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of stupid 12-year-old games... Yes?

1430
01:38:54,554 --> 01:38:55,895
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you going to be on Halo 2?

1431
01:38:56,595 --> 01:38:56,995
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course.

1432
01:38:58,111 --> 01:39:00,732
[SPEAKER_06]: I get to frag a fag.

1433
01:39:00,812 --> 01:39:02,332
[SPEAKER_06]: I get to frag a fag.

1434
01:39:02,453 --> 01:39:05,554
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, most people in Texas would be, you know, happy about that.

1435
01:39:05,594 --> 01:39:06,174
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, no, I'm kidding.

1436
01:39:06,674 --> 01:39:07,414
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, come on.

1437
01:39:07,434 --> 01:39:09,455
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been four years since we lynched a queer.

1438
01:39:09,535 --> 01:39:11,095
[SPEAKER_10]: I accept your challenge, Mr. Donovan.

1439
01:39:17,236 --> 01:39:20,977
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you better, Mr. Roberts.

1440
01:39:20,997 --> 01:39:26,599
[SPEAKER_09]: And then when I kill you, I'm going to say, Ha ha, you got your ass kicked by a fag.

1441
01:39:28,060 --> 01:39:32,881
[SPEAKER_24]: Just like I do to the little hecklers that try to challenge me on ADR.

1442
01:39:34,402 --> 01:39:38,823
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we put Jenna's 10-year-old nephew on, and he kicks both our asses, which he does on a regular basis.

1443
01:39:39,624 --> 01:39:39,964
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1444
01:39:40,384 --> 01:39:41,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is scary.

1445
01:39:41,224 --> 01:39:44,826
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, we've got to cut it short, because we've got to get to the bit that we stole from USL, okay?

1446
01:39:45,426 --> 01:39:45,926
[SPEAKER_06]: What bit?

1447
01:39:46,414 --> 01:39:47,175
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, the match game.

1448
01:39:49,017 --> 01:39:51,700
[SPEAKER_06]: You copyright stealin' motherfuckin'.

1449
01:39:52,501 --> 01:39:54,924
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, wouldn't it have been copywritten before?

1450
01:39:54,944 --> 01:39:56,625
[SPEAKER_19]: You stole it.

1451
01:39:56,645 --> 01:39:58,227
[SPEAKER_19]: Copywritten and trademarked.

1452
01:39:59,148 --> 01:40:02,632
[SPEAKER_06]: But I stole it, like, one hundredth time down the line.

1453
01:40:04,654 --> 01:40:05,315
[SPEAKER_24]: It's homage!

1454
01:40:06,116 --> 01:40:07,798
[SPEAKER_10]: Imitation is the finest form of flattery.

1455
01:40:09,841 --> 01:40:10,441
[SPEAKER_10]: Love you, Travis.

1456
01:40:10,921 --> 01:40:11,561
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, whatever.

1457
01:40:11,661 --> 01:40:12,062
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye.

1458
01:40:12,782 --> 01:40:13,262
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye.

1459
01:40:13,562 --> 01:40:14,122
[SPEAKER_20]: Bye, Travis.

1460
01:40:14,302 --> 01:40:15,462
[SPEAKER_10]: That was nice to have him on the show.

1461
01:40:15,522 --> 01:40:16,663
[SPEAKER_10]: Yay, Travis.

1462
01:40:16,723 --> 01:40:17,443
[SPEAKER_10]: That's exciting.

1463
01:40:17,463 --> 01:40:19,683
[SPEAKER_10]: I've never been asked to be a vice presidential candidate before.

1464
01:40:20,003 --> 01:40:25,765
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been asked to be somebody's maid of honor, but never the vice presidential candidate.

1465
01:40:25,925 --> 01:40:26,885
[SPEAKER_10]: That's going to be amazing.

1466
01:40:27,085 --> 01:40:27,605
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm excited.

1467
01:40:28,225 --> 01:40:28,485
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1468
01:40:28,705 --> 01:40:30,986
[SPEAKER_10]: We are going to open it up for match game in just a minute.

1469
01:40:31,066 --> 01:40:35,327
[SPEAKER_10]: However, we had one other person that wanted to talk to us in the studio.

1470
01:40:35,367 --> 01:40:37,127
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, we're going to make another call, believe it or not.

1471
01:40:37,888 --> 01:40:39,348
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's go ahead and make that call.

1472
01:40:39,707 --> 01:40:40,127
[SPEAKER_10]: Right now.

1473
01:40:45,431 --> 01:40:46,011
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, there we go.

1474
01:40:46,071 --> 01:40:46,451
[SPEAKER_10]: Yay.

1475
01:40:46,591 --> 01:40:47,732
[SPEAKER_19]: One ringy-tingy.

1476
01:40:50,174 --> 01:40:50,514
[SPEAKER_19]: Hello?

1477
01:40:51,615 --> 01:40:52,855
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, is this Shane?

1478
01:40:53,636 --> 01:40:53,976
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1479
01:40:54,336 --> 01:40:55,477
[SPEAKER_10]: We can barely hear you.

1480
01:40:55,557 --> 01:40:56,698
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you talk louder or something?

1481
01:40:57,899 --> 01:40:58,579
[SPEAKER_11]: Is this loud?

1482
01:40:59,139 --> 01:40:59,660
[SPEAKER_10]: Somewhat.

1483
01:40:59,700 --> 01:41:01,901
[SPEAKER_10]: We can, like, barely, barely hear you.

1484
01:41:02,902 --> 01:41:03,262
[SPEAKER_10]: What's up?

1485
01:41:03,282 --> 01:41:04,022
[SPEAKER_11]: That sucks.

1486
01:41:04,343 --> 01:41:04,783
[SPEAKER_11]: Nothing.

1487
01:41:05,563 --> 01:41:06,224
[SPEAKER_11]: Can't yell.

1488
01:41:07,240 --> 01:41:08,321
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, well, what's up?

1489
01:41:08,501 --> 01:41:10,583
[SPEAKER_10]: You wanted to say hello to some folks here, or what's up?

1490
01:41:11,484 --> 01:41:12,605
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, hi everybody.

1491
01:41:12,625 --> 01:41:12,665
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi!

1492
01:41:16,308 --> 01:41:17,189
[SPEAKER_10]: How's it going for you?

1493
01:41:18,070 --> 01:41:18,650
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sick.

1494
01:41:18,910 --> 01:41:19,571
[SPEAKER_10]: You're sick?

1495
01:41:19,711 --> 01:41:21,593
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, another sick person, great.

1496
01:41:21,813 --> 01:41:22,153
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1497
01:41:22,894 --> 01:41:23,754
[SPEAKER_10]: What are you sick with?

1498
01:41:23,915 --> 01:41:24,395
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I'm puking.

1499
01:41:25,036 --> 01:41:25,556
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure.

1500
01:41:26,156 --> 01:41:26,277
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh.

1501
01:41:27,017 --> 01:41:33,563
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, unfortunately the volume is so low that it's hard for us to hear you right now, but do you have anything you wanted to say since we called you?

1502
01:41:33,583 --> 01:41:33,663
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1503
01:41:35,027 --> 01:41:47,616
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to say that everybody needs to buy Karaoke Revolution for Xbox this week so Halo 2 doesn't take all the sales because I don't want to keep selling Halo 2 this week.

1504
01:41:48,877 --> 01:41:53,220
[SPEAKER_11]: And watch Drawn Together on Comedy Central because it's funny.

1505
01:41:54,501 --> 01:41:57,743
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's it.

1506
01:41:58,224 --> 01:42:01,066
[SPEAKER_10]: And is there any Ultramix 2 songs you're looking forward to?

1507
01:42:02,884 --> 01:42:04,425
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but I can't say them.

1508
01:42:04,625 --> 01:42:07,147
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I thought he was going to say Baile La Samba.

1509
01:42:07,668 --> 01:42:09,089
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, well, I already said that last time.

1510
01:42:09,129 --> 01:42:09,409
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

1511
01:42:09,689 --> 01:42:10,090
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

1512
01:42:10,530 --> 01:42:11,631
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, Baile La Samba.

1513
01:42:12,111 --> 01:42:14,473
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll play Baile La Samba just for you a little later.

1514
01:42:15,334 --> 01:42:15,894
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, cool.

1515
01:42:16,035 --> 01:42:19,397
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well, I'm sorry, we're going to have to let you go because it's too quiet, but you have a good one, okay?

1516
01:42:19,417 --> 01:42:20,478
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, you too.

1517
01:42:20,518 --> 01:42:21,259
[SPEAKER_10]: Everyone say bye, Shane.

1518
01:42:21,299 --> 01:42:21,659
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.

1519
01:42:21,679 --> 01:42:22,400
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye, Shane.

1520
01:42:22,440 --> 01:42:24,221
[SPEAKER_01]: Come back to California, you bum.

1521
01:42:24,421 --> 01:42:25,382
Play Final Fantasy.

1522
01:42:26,643 --> 01:42:27,564
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, I hope he heard that.

1523
01:42:27,824 --> 01:42:30,286
[SPEAKER_10]: They said, come back to California, you bum, and play Final Fantasy.

1524
01:42:32,352 --> 01:42:33,032
[SPEAKER_10]: I think he already hung up.

1525
01:42:33,152 --> 01:42:33,392
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh well.

1526
01:42:34,313 --> 01:42:36,293
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully he hears that when it comes through a little later.

1527
01:42:38,334 --> 01:42:38,594
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

1528
01:42:40,795 --> 01:42:41,355
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

1529
01:42:41,755 --> 01:42:43,956
[SPEAKER_10]: What we're going to do now... Should we get into Match Game?

1530
01:42:43,976 --> 01:42:45,196
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys want to take a quick break?

1531
01:42:45,236 --> 01:42:46,157
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's get into Match Game.

1532
01:42:46,437 --> 01:42:47,597
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got to find the Match Game music though.

1533
01:42:48,657 --> 01:42:49,598
[SPEAKER_24]: How about a one song break?

1534
01:42:50,078 --> 01:42:52,239
[SPEAKER_10]: We want to do just a quick little break while we set up?

1535
01:42:52,539 --> 01:42:53,019
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be good.

1536
01:42:53,619 --> 01:42:54,299
[SPEAKER_10]: A quick one song break.

1537
01:42:54,519 --> 01:42:55,920
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, everybody's been wanting to hear...

1538
01:42:56,943 --> 01:42:58,605
[SPEAKER_09]: What was the song that I wanted to play for people?

1539
01:42:58,625 --> 01:43:02,168
[SPEAKER_10]: It's called Set People On Fire I don't remember, what was it?

1540
01:43:20,763 --> 01:43:23,491
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, it's Baile La Samba, since we just talked to Shane, of course.

1541
01:43:23,531 --> 01:43:24,213
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to play this one.

1542
01:43:24,233 --> 01:43:25,636
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll be back right after this.

1543
01:43:25,757 --> 01:43:27,782
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Baile La Samba from DDR Ultramix 2.

1544
01:43:27,963 --> 01:43:28,303
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll be back.

1545
01:43:47,114 --> 01:43:47,594
and many more.

1546
01:44:27,740 --> 01:44:28,601
Thanks for watching!

1547
01:45:05,239 --> 01:45:07,121
[SPEAKER_10]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1548
01:45:07,141 --> 01:45:11,824
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to get into the Monty Match Game pretty soon here.

1549
01:45:12,305 --> 01:45:14,927
[SPEAKER_10]: We're just trying to get the files copied over that we need.

1550
01:45:15,847 --> 01:45:16,308
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1551
01:45:17,849 --> 01:45:20,191
[SPEAKER_10]: So the way this works, we're going to open up the Skype line in just a minute.

1552
01:45:20,631 --> 01:45:23,013
[SPEAKER_10]: And just as a reminder, there's a little bit of a buffer.

1553
01:45:23,033 --> 01:45:28,517
[SPEAKER_10]: So you're going to want to watch for the little icon to turn green because that's really the moment when we're starting to take calls.

1554
01:45:28,878 --> 01:45:31,279
[SPEAKER_10]: So the first person through will get to play Match Game tonight.

1555
01:45:31,339 --> 01:45:33,821
[SPEAKER_10]: And you get to challenge somebody in the room.

1556
01:45:34,722 --> 01:45:35,483
[SPEAKER_10]: but not one of the hosts.

1557
01:45:35,503 --> 01:45:38,565
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to challenge a guest because that's the rule that I just made up.

1558
01:45:39,686 --> 01:45:41,127
[SPEAKER_24]: That was very Izzard of you.

1559
01:45:41,427 --> 01:45:42,328
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1560
01:45:43,208 --> 01:45:44,269
[SPEAKER_10]: Cake or death.

1561
01:45:45,490 --> 01:45:49,913
[SPEAKER_10]: So you get to challenge one of the guests and all the other guests will be answering questions.

1562
01:45:49,933 --> 01:45:55,197
[SPEAKER_10]: So the way Match Game works, we have a little statement that we read and the statement has a blank in it.

1563
01:45:55,737 --> 01:45:57,018
[SPEAKER_10]: and then you have to fill in the blank.

1564
01:45:57,058 --> 01:46:00,420
[SPEAKER_10]: You want to try and match as many other people in the room on the blank as you can.

1565
01:46:00,440 --> 01:46:04,282
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to make it a quick game tonight because Shark Skrull and Floatwalk, unfortunately, they have to get out of here pretty soon.

1566
01:46:04,902 --> 01:46:05,983
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have to kind of make it a quick game.

1567
01:46:06,003 --> 01:46:07,264
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be a three question game tonight.

1568
01:46:08,044 --> 01:46:09,285
[SPEAKER_24]: It's like Mad Libs, only not.

1569
01:46:09,785 --> 01:46:11,046
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, it's like Mad Libs, only not.

1570
01:46:11,186 --> 01:46:11,526
[SPEAKER_10]: Very good.

1571
01:46:11,586 --> 01:46:15,228
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's find ourselves some match game music here.

1572
01:46:15,688 --> 01:46:18,410
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not the same match game theme, but it's good.

1573
01:46:21,231 --> 01:46:22,212
[SPEAKER_10]: Price is Right car music.

1574
01:46:26,775 --> 01:46:27,756
[SPEAKER_10]: A new car!

1575
01:46:28,716 --> 01:46:30,177
[SPEAKER_09]: You've won the Geo Metro.

1576
01:46:30,538 --> 01:46:32,119
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

1577
01:46:33,240 --> 01:46:35,881
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see what happens when we open it up and get a caller.

1578
01:46:35,981 --> 01:46:41,145
[SPEAKER_10]: And remember, if we can't hear you very well, we are going to have to boot you and get somebody else.

1579
01:46:41,185 --> 01:46:43,647
[SPEAKER_10]: So the skyline is open and let's see who we get.

1580
01:46:44,107 --> 01:46:45,088
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1581
01:46:45,128 --> 01:46:45,528
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

1582
01:46:46,269 --> 01:46:46,949
[SPEAKER_10]: John Fields.

1583
01:46:47,109 --> 01:46:47,750
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, John.

1584
01:46:47,770 --> 01:46:48,310
[SPEAKER_10]: How you doing?

1585
01:46:48,830 --> 01:46:49,311
[SPEAKER_24]: Hey.

1586
01:46:50,251 --> 01:46:50,492
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes?

1587
01:46:51,873 --> 01:46:52,193
[SPEAKER_10]: You there?

1588
01:46:52,753 --> 01:46:52,933
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1589
01:46:54,054 --> 01:46:54,995
[SPEAKER_10]: You're dropping out a little bit.

1590
01:46:55,831 --> 01:46:56,291
[SPEAKER_34]: Sorry, hang on.

1591
01:46:56,912 --> 01:47:01,314
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, you gotta cancel the porn torrents to get it working.

1592
01:47:01,534 --> 01:47:02,915
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I think he disconnected.

1593
01:47:02,955 --> 01:47:03,415
[SPEAKER_10]: No, here you are.

1594
01:47:03,475 --> 01:47:03,756
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello?

1595
01:47:04,276 --> 01:47:04,556
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm here.

1596
01:47:04,916 --> 01:47:05,417
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, he's here.

1597
01:47:05,617 --> 01:47:06,597
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, we got our contestant.

1598
01:47:07,078 --> 01:47:09,159
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm gonna put us back in do not disturb mode.

1599
01:47:10,199 --> 01:47:13,821
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, so John, the first question is, who do you want to challenge tonight?

1600
01:47:13,841 --> 01:47:15,943
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me go down the candidates one more time, John.

1601
01:47:15,963 --> 01:47:16,243
[SPEAKER_10]: You ready?

1602
01:47:16,523 --> 01:47:22,687
[SPEAKER_10]: Floatwalk, Shark's Girl, Islander, Iguana Girl, Navi, Arcadian 42.

1603
01:47:22,767 --> 01:47:23,207
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's it gonna be?

1604
01:47:23,996 --> 01:47:25,237
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's try Navi.

1605
01:47:25,677 --> 01:47:26,317
[SPEAKER_10]: Navi!

1606
01:47:26,337 --> 01:47:29,959
[SPEAKER_10]: You know I suck at these games, huh?

1607
01:47:31,060 --> 01:47:34,482
[SPEAKER_10]: John knows that you suck at these little games, so he's going for you.

1608
01:47:34,882 --> 01:47:38,324
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's have ourselves a little match here.

1609
01:47:38,384 --> 01:47:39,184
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, you guys ready?

[SPEAKER_10]: Rob was so excited to be going to GameStop to get his copy of Karaoke Revolution Volume 3 on this lovely Monday night at the Halo 2 pre-sale.

1663
01:50:46,667 --> 01:50:54,611
[SPEAKER_10]: But when he took the game to the counter, the clerk looked at the game he was buying and said, You're buying Karaoke Revolution instead of Halo 2?

1664
01:50:55,212 --> 01:50:57,393
[SPEAKER_10]: Karaoke Revolution must be really blank.

1665
01:51:01,573 --> 01:51:01,793
[SPEAKER_10]: Right?

1666
01:51:02,194 --> 01:51:04,236
[SPEAKER_10]: You gotta let the celebrities think about it, John.

1667
01:51:04,296 --> 01:51:04,656
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold on.

1668
01:51:07,199 --> 01:51:11,444
[SPEAKER_09]: He looked at the game he was buying and said, You're buying Karaoke Revolution instead of Halo 2?

1669
01:51:12,284 --> 01:51:14,387
[SPEAKER_09]: Karaoke Revolution must be really blank.

1670
01:51:34,383 --> 01:51:36,524
[SPEAKER_05]: The celebrities are writing their answers.

1671
01:51:36,564 --> 01:51:38,746
[SPEAKER_16]: Have all the celebrities dinged in?

1672
01:51:38,806 --> 01:51:39,987
[SPEAKER_16]: Raise your hand if you're dinged.

1673
01:51:40,007 --> 01:51:41,287
Still thinking, DarkSakura?

1674
01:51:41,347 --> 01:51:41,968
Oh, okay.

1675
01:52:02,791 --> 01:52:03,611
[SPEAKER_05]: You got it, Sharks Girl?

1676
01:52:08,693 --> 01:52:09,033
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1677
01:52:11,074 --> 01:52:11,734
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, she's got it.

1678
01:52:11,754 --> 01:52:12,094
[SPEAKER_10]: Here we go.

1679
01:52:12,114 --> 01:52:15,295
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to have Navi go first, your competition tonight.

1680
01:52:15,335 --> 01:52:16,336
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see, Navi.

1681
01:52:17,276 --> 01:52:20,577
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob was so excited to be going to GameStop to get his copy of Karaoke Revolution Vol.

1682
01:52:20,757 --> 01:52:28,000
[SPEAKER_10]: 3 on this lovely Monday night at the Halo 2 presale, but when he took the game to the counter, the clerk looked at the game he was buying and said, You're buying Karaoke Revolution instead of Halo 2.

1683
01:52:28,420 --> 01:52:30,781
[SPEAKER_10]: Karaoke Revolution must be really hot.

1684
01:52:33,035 --> 01:52:34,116
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, John, what do you think?

1685
01:52:34,176 --> 01:52:38,118
[SPEAKER_10]: Karaoke Revolution must be really... A huge sleeper.

1686
01:52:38,918 --> 01:52:39,579
[SPEAKER_10]: Huge what?

1687
01:52:40,159 --> 01:52:40,599
[SPEAKER_10]: Sleeper.

1688
01:52:41,060 --> 01:52:42,100
[SPEAKER_10]: Huge sleeper.

1689
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:43,001
[SPEAKER_10]: Like a sleeper hit.

1690
01:52:43,041 --> 01:52:44,422
[SPEAKER_10]: You know those games that are really underground?

1691
01:52:44,762 --> 01:52:47,263
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, neither answer perverted in the slightest.

1692
01:52:47,303 --> 01:52:48,864
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see if that pays off or not.

1693
01:52:49,264 --> 01:52:49,605
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

1694
01:52:49,645 --> 01:52:51,145
[SPEAKER_10]: We got Hot and Big Sleeper.

1695
01:52:51,446 --> 01:52:54,607
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, Karaoke Revolution must be really... Super!

1696
01:52:54,888 --> 01:52:56,048
[SPEAKER_10]: Super!

1697
01:52:56,168 --> 01:52:57,009
[SPEAKER_10]: Not a match, sorry.

1698
01:52:58,630 --> 01:53:02,092
[SPEAKER_10]: Floatwalk, Karaoke Revolution must be very...

1699
01:53:03,032 --> 01:53:05,414
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, since it's Microsoft, it must be Green with Envy.

1700
01:53:05,954 --> 01:53:08,196
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh, Green with Envy.

1701
01:53:08,436 --> 01:53:09,457
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting, all right.

1702
01:53:10,298 --> 01:53:11,439
[SPEAKER_10]: Shark Skrull, but not a match.

1703
01:53:11,799 --> 01:53:18,284
[SPEAKER_21]: Shark Skrull, Karaoke Revolution must be very... I've been playing way too much Katamari Damacy and playing the Pisces one, so it must be really fresh.

1704
01:53:18,945 --> 01:53:19,485
[SPEAKER_10]: Fresh!

1705
01:53:21,527 --> 01:53:24,669
[SPEAKER_10]: Islander, Karaoke Revolution must be really... Neato.

1706
01:53:25,170 --> 01:53:25,810
[SPEAKER_09]: Neato!

1707
01:53:26,170 --> 01:53:26,651
[SPEAKER_10]: Not a match.

1708
01:53:26,891 --> 01:53:27,471
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, guys.

1709
01:53:28,512 --> 01:53:30,394
[SPEAKER_10]: Iguana Girl, Karaoke Revolution must be really...

1710
01:53:30,762 --> 01:53:31,322
[SPEAKER_10]: Hetero.

1711
01:53:31,563 --> 01:53:32,624
[SPEAKER_10]: Hetero.

1712
01:53:33,484 --> 01:53:35,766
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh, going for a little bit of that reverse psychology there.

1713
01:53:35,886 --> 01:53:36,787
[SPEAKER_10]: Like it, but not a match.

1714
01:53:37,447 --> 01:53:37,868
[SPEAKER_10]: Arcadian.

1715
01:53:38,728 --> 01:53:41,511
[SPEAKER_03]: I particularly heard full of before that, so I say porn.

1716
01:53:41,771 --> 01:53:42,251
[SPEAKER_10]: Full of porn.

1717
01:53:42,531 --> 01:53:43,492
[SPEAKER_10]: Full of porn!

1718
01:53:43,512 --> 01:53:44,973
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope not.

1719
01:53:45,514 --> 01:53:46,775
[SPEAKER_10]: But we'll see on Tuesday.

1720
01:53:46,855 --> 01:53:47,636
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, not a match.

1721
01:53:48,376 --> 01:53:50,418
[SPEAKER_10]: That's close to hot, but not close enough.

1722
01:53:51,018 --> 01:53:53,000
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki must be very... Gay.

1723
01:53:53,020 --> 01:53:53,080
[SPEAKER_10]: Gay.

1724
01:53:55,245 --> 01:53:56,966
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you went for the obvious one.

1725
01:53:59,347 --> 01:54:02,489
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to put gay people, but I'm like, no wait, that's what the question was the other way around.

1726
01:54:03,910 --> 01:54:11,194
[SPEAKER_09]: I said, karaoke must be very much for people into water sports because the box is yellow.

1727
01:54:14,235 --> 01:54:19,598
[SPEAKER_17]: Forget it.

1728
01:54:19,678 --> 01:54:20,979
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all tied up with a big nothing.

1729
01:54:21,659 --> 01:54:23,340
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go to the next question, shall we?

1730
01:54:23,941 --> 01:54:24,441
[SPEAKER_10]: You ready, John?

1731
01:54:25,353 --> 01:54:25,513
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

1732
01:54:25,713 --> 01:54:26,174
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, here we go.

1733
01:54:27,574 --> 01:54:27,975
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

1734
01:54:28,535 --> 01:54:33,838
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura was all excited to be getting a really expensive present for Christmas this year.

1735
01:54:34,679 --> 01:54:39,422
[SPEAKER_10]: She was really excited to see a big package come from an Orange Lounge radio fan.

1736
01:54:40,422 --> 01:54:47,687
[SPEAKER_10]: But when she tore off the wrapping paper, she started burninating the Christmas decorations in a fit of rage when she saw that they had bought her a blank.

1737
01:54:56,087 --> 01:54:58,611
[SPEAKER_05]: The celebrities are currently thinking of their answers.

1738
01:54:59,473 --> 01:55:01,496
[SPEAKER_05]: When they saw that they had bought her a...

1739
01:55:31,409 --> 01:55:34,351
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, everybody, uh, everybody, ding-ding?

1740
01:55:34,631 --> 01:55:35,832
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, ding-ding-ding?

1741
01:55:36,192 --> 01:55:37,993
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright, here we go.

1742
01:55:39,634 --> 01:55:41,034
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, John's gonna start us off this time.

1743
01:55:41,054 --> 01:55:41,555
[SPEAKER_10]: You ready, John?

1744
01:55:42,235 --> 01:55:42,395
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

1745
01:55:42,655 --> 01:55:47,758
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, uh, DarkSakura was all excited to be getting a really expensive present for Christmas this year.

1746
01:55:48,158 --> 01:55:51,640
[SPEAKER_10]: She was really excited to see a big package come from an Orange Lounge Radio fan.

1747
01:55:52,020 --> 01:55:58,104
[SPEAKER_10]: But when she tore off the wrapping paper, she started burninating the Christmas decorations in a fit of rage when she saw that they had bought her...

1748
01:55:59,577 --> 01:56:00,417
[SPEAKER_10]: A flamethrower.

1749
01:56:00,718 --> 01:56:02,418
[SPEAKER_10]: A flamethrower!

1750
01:56:02,899 --> 01:56:04,620
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, because that's why somebody would burninate.

1751
01:56:04,640 --> 01:56:05,540
[SPEAKER_10]: Very logical.

1752
01:56:05,600 --> 01:56:06,460
[SPEAKER_10]: Will logic pay off?

1753
01:56:06,601 --> 01:56:07,741
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably not, but we'll see.

1754
01:56:08,522 --> 01:56:12,704
[SPEAKER_10]: Navi started burninating when they saw they had bought her... A Foreman Grill.

1755
01:56:13,064 --> 01:56:14,344
[SPEAKER_10]: A Foreman Grill!

1756
01:56:15,205 --> 01:56:16,746
[SPEAKER_24]: I got one of those for Christmas once.

1757
01:56:17,786 --> 01:56:18,186
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

1758
01:56:19,247 --> 01:56:20,588
[SPEAKER_09]: Started burninating the steak.

1759
01:56:21,248 --> 01:56:27,171
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see, DarkSakura, what did you start... You started burninating when they bought you a... King of All Cosmos package.

1760
01:56:27,694 --> 01:56:29,815
[SPEAKER_10]: King of all Cosmos package.

1761
01:56:31,476 --> 01:56:32,196
[SPEAKER_09]: I see.

1762
01:56:32,276 --> 01:56:33,357
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, very nice.

1763
01:56:33,497 --> 01:56:34,598
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be a large package.

1764
01:56:34,678 --> 01:56:34,858
[SPEAKER_09]: Good.

1765
01:56:35,458 --> 01:56:39,100
[SPEAKER_10]: FloWalk, Bot Hurray, Apolitary Poster.

1766
01:56:39,120 --> 01:56:40,861
[SPEAKER_10]: Apolitary Poster!

1767
01:56:42,342 --> 01:56:42,942
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, not a match.

1768
01:56:43,542 --> 01:56:45,243
[SPEAKER_21]: Excuse me, I'm going to go be violently ill.

1769
01:56:45,503 --> 01:56:46,244
[SPEAKER_10]: Shark Skrull.

1770
01:56:47,085 --> 01:56:48,666
[SPEAKER_21]: A box of ferret poison.

1771
01:56:48,886 --> 01:56:50,647
[SPEAKER_10]: A box of ferret poison.

1772
01:56:50,908 --> 01:56:51,868
[SPEAKER_10]: Awe, I made her cry.

1773
01:56:53,049 --> 01:56:54,630
[SPEAKER_10]: Islander, a blank.

1774
01:56:55,231 --> 01:56:56,031
[SPEAKER_10]: A bag of boogers.

1775
01:56:56,331 --> 01:56:57,652
[SPEAKER_10]: A bag of boogers!

1776
01:56:59,854 --> 01:57:02,596
[SPEAKER_09]: Dear DarkSakura, I'm your number one fan.

1777
01:57:02,696 --> 01:57:03,937
[SPEAKER_09]: I picked these just for you.

1778
01:57:08,510 --> 01:57:10,691
[SPEAKER_10]: Sadly enough, I could see that happening with some of our listeners.

1779
01:57:11,151 --> 01:57:11,631
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just kidding.

1780
01:57:11,751 --> 01:57:12,131
[SPEAKER_10]: Love you guys.

1781
01:57:13,772 --> 01:57:15,772
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm your number one pick every time.

1782
01:57:15,792 --> 01:57:17,833
[SPEAKER_10]: Iguana Girl.

1783
01:57:19,173 --> 01:57:21,334
[SPEAKER_19]: Ironically, mine's actually along the same vein.

1784
01:57:21,954 --> 01:57:22,214
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1785
01:57:22,334 --> 01:57:24,475
[SPEAKER_19]: Huge piles of feces.

1786
01:57:24,915 --> 01:57:26,815
[SPEAKER_09]: Huge piles of feces.

1787
01:57:27,315 --> 01:57:27,736
[SPEAKER_19]: Shade marks.

1788
01:57:28,056 --> 01:57:28,536
[SPEAKER_10]: Not a match.

1789
01:57:30,336 --> 01:57:30,616
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1790
01:57:31,197 --> 01:57:34,277
[SPEAKER_10]: Arcadian, we're looking for... I forgot the answers now already.

1791
01:57:34,298 --> 01:57:34,738
[SPEAKER_10]: A big fact is...

1792
01:57:37,031 --> 01:57:40,314
[SPEAKER_10]: with a karaoke machine of Politary's greatest hits.

1793
01:57:40,634 --> 01:57:43,256
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, a karaoke machine of Politary's greatest hits.

1794
01:57:45,818 --> 01:57:46,479
[SPEAKER_22]: Chirp chirp.

1795
01:57:47,059 --> 01:57:47,539
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki.

1796
01:57:49,221 --> 01:57:55,966
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it's sad that no one got Jamie's because mine was the king of the cosmos, Severed Cock.

1797
01:57:58,472 --> 01:58:00,033
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be a big package.

1798
01:58:00,533 --> 01:58:01,734
[SPEAKER_09]: Mine's somewhat similar.

1799
01:58:01,854 --> 01:58:07,697
[SPEAKER_09]: I said that she burninated everything when she saw that the present was a dildo modeled after Naoki.

1800
01:58:10,558 --> 01:58:11,418
[SPEAKER_24]: How would I find it?

1801
01:58:12,599 --> 01:58:13,259
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's move on.

1802
01:58:13,639 --> 01:58:14,020
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1803
01:58:15,140 --> 01:58:15,640
[SPEAKER_10]: Very nice.

1804
01:58:16,421 --> 01:58:16,701
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1805
01:58:16,761 --> 01:58:17,461
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all tied up 0-0.

1806
01:58:17,481 --> 01:58:19,062
[SPEAKER_10]: John, are you going to break this tie?

1807
01:58:20,062 --> 01:58:20,543
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

1808
01:58:20,743 --> 01:58:22,244
[SPEAKER_10]: Navi, are you going to break this tie?

1809
01:58:24,385 --> 01:58:24,665
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe.

1810
01:58:24,945 --> 01:58:25,165
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1811
01:58:25,185 --> 01:58:25,465
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

1812
01:58:25,485 --> 01:58:26,005
[SPEAKER_10]: Here we go.

1813
01:58:26,245 --> 01:58:27,126
[SPEAKER_10]: Question number three.

1814
01:58:29,457 --> 01:58:33,940
[SPEAKER_10]: We here at Orange Lounge Radio have become very concerned about Loki.

1815
01:58:36,142 --> 01:58:36,722
[SPEAKER_10]: When haven't we?

1816
01:58:36,762 --> 01:58:37,183
[SPEAKER_10]: But here we go.

1817
01:58:37,503 --> 01:58:38,964
[SPEAKER_10]: We've been very concerned about Loki.

1818
01:58:39,264 --> 01:58:42,286
[SPEAKER_10]: He's been playing a lot of Grand Theft Auto this week.

1819
01:58:43,007 --> 01:58:46,669
[SPEAKER_10]: And he started to blur the line between San Andreas and real life.

1820
01:58:47,930 --> 01:58:52,073
[SPEAKER_10]: The other co-hosts got very concerned of this when Loki went around in blank.

1821
01:58:56,497 --> 01:58:58,318
[SPEAKER_10]: The other co-hosts got very concerned that...

1822
01:58:59,028 --> 01:59:02,530
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki was taking Grand Theft Auto a little too seriously when Loki went around and blanked.

1823
01:59:21,319 --> 01:59:24,661
[SPEAKER_05]: The celebrities are currently thinking, please wait.

1824
01:59:34,986 --> 01:59:35,306
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1825
01:59:35,866 --> 01:59:36,406
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, let's see.

1826
01:59:38,047 --> 01:59:38,827
[SPEAKER_10]: Are we going to get a winner?

1827
01:59:39,287 --> 01:59:39,847
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll find out.

1828
01:59:40,207 --> 01:59:40,948
[SPEAKER_10]: Anybody still working?

1829
01:59:42,008 --> 01:59:42,208
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1830
01:59:42,228 --> 01:59:42,608
[SPEAKER_10]: Here we go.

1831
01:59:43,588 --> 01:59:43,928
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1832
01:59:45,069 --> 01:59:47,729
[SPEAKER_10]: It all comes down to this.

1833
01:59:49,370 --> 01:59:51,671
[SPEAKER_10]: We here at Orange Lounge Radio have become very concerned about Loki.

1834
01:59:51,711 --> 01:59:56,612
[SPEAKER_10]: He's been playing a lot of Grand Theft Auto this week, and he's starting to blur the line between San Andreas and real life.

1835
01:59:57,092 --> 02:00:00,393
[SPEAKER_10]: The other co-hosts got very concerned of this when Loki went around and Navi...

1836
02:00:01,195 --> 02:00:04,838
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1837
02:00:25,780 --> 02:00:33,265
[SPEAKER_24]: and the outfit of some stereotypical thug and tried to jack a plane, crash into the ocean, steal a semi and listen to the light FM while shooting at people.

1838
02:00:34,026 --> 02:00:34,846
[SPEAKER_10]: Very descriptive.

1839
02:00:34,967 --> 02:00:36,247
[SPEAKER_10]: I like that, but not a match.

1840
02:00:36,668 --> 02:00:37,368
[SPEAKER_24]: Shooting at people.

1841
02:00:37,708 --> 02:00:38,009
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

1842
02:00:39,089 --> 02:00:41,051
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, but now, it's a little too much.

1843
02:00:41,071 --> 02:00:43,953
[SPEAKER_10]: That doesn't necessarily mean I hit them, therefore not hurting them.

1844
02:00:44,233 --> 02:00:44,613
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

1845
02:00:45,414 --> 02:00:45,914
[SPEAKER_10]: FloWalk.

1846
02:00:47,635 --> 02:00:49,036
[SPEAKER_10]: Chase them with the purple dildo.

1847
02:00:49,136 --> 02:00:51,098
[SPEAKER_10]: Chase them with the purple dildo.

1848
02:00:51,198 --> 02:00:51,538
[SPEAKER_10]: Not a match.

1849
02:00:52,219 --> 02:00:52,659
[SPEAKER_10]: StarScroll.

1850
02:00:53,291 --> 02:00:56,052
[SPEAKER_21]: Jumped out of a plane screaming, it's a mile drop, I'll live!

1851
02:00:59,553 --> 02:01:00,814
[SPEAKER_10]: This is true, this is true.

1852
02:01:01,234 --> 02:01:01,614
[SPEAKER_10]: Islander.

1853
02:01:02,134 --> 02:01:03,835
[SPEAKER_10]: When he said, bitch, I'm gonna kill you!

1854
02:01:04,895 --> 02:01:05,876
[SPEAKER_10]: Bitch, I'm gonna kill you!

1855
02:01:06,056 --> 02:01:08,376
[SPEAKER_10]: Very close to capping your ass, but not quite.

1856
02:01:08,436 --> 02:01:08,917
[SPEAKER_10]: Iguana Girl.

1857
02:01:09,137 --> 02:01:09,837
[SPEAKER_19]: That was boring.

1858
02:01:09,937 --> 02:01:10,937
[SPEAKER_19]: Hijacked a helicopter.

1859
02:01:11,157 --> 02:01:12,278
[SPEAKER_10]: Hijacked a helicopter.

1860
02:01:13,380 --> 02:01:17,123
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, that would have been exciting if Loki really did that, but I don't think I would have been concerned.

1861
02:01:17,643 --> 02:01:18,684
[SPEAKER_10]: You know how to fly a helicopter?

1862
02:01:19,044 --> 02:01:19,364
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

1863
02:01:20,325 --> 02:01:21,045
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, Arcadian.

1864
02:01:21,465 --> 02:01:22,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Ran over pedestrians.

1865
02:01:22,926 --> 02:01:24,547
[SPEAKER_10]: Ran over pedestrians.

1866
02:01:24,567 --> 02:01:25,188
[SPEAKER_10]: He does that anyway.

1867
02:01:25,228 --> 02:01:26,449
[SPEAKER_10]: Not a match, he does that anyway.

1868
02:01:27,029 --> 02:01:27,369
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki.

1869
02:01:27,950 --> 02:01:29,591
[SPEAKER_10]: I would have figured that would have been a match, actually.

1870
02:01:30,051 --> 02:01:30,952
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's see here.

1871
02:01:31,332 --> 02:01:35,094
[SPEAKER_10]: Shooting the po-po and pimping crack hoes to make some fat scratch.

1872
02:01:38,957 --> 02:01:40,158
[SPEAKER_08]: Lovely, lovely.

1873
02:01:41,259 --> 02:01:48,005
[SPEAKER_10]: And my answer was, the other co-host got very concerned with this one, Loki went around and killed DarkSakura with his pimp cane.

1874
02:01:53,590 --> 02:01:55,371
[SPEAKER_10]: I got a ferret thrown at me for that one.

1875
02:01:56,532 --> 02:01:57,133
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

1876
02:01:57,593 --> 02:02:00,095
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, let's review the scores, boys and girls.

1877
02:02:00,156 --> 02:02:02,498
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's look at how our contestants did tonight.

1878
02:02:05,820 --> 02:02:07,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's look at the final scores!

1879
02:02:10,764 --> 02:02:16,106
[SPEAKER_05]: And in second place is Navi with zero points!

1880
02:02:17,167 --> 02:02:21,128
[SPEAKER_05]: And a tie for second place is John Fields with zero points!

1881
02:02:21,909 --> 02:02:26,411
[SPEAKER_10]: Congratulations John and Navi, you are our big losers tonight.

1882
02:02:27,391 --> 02:02:32,013
[SPEAKER_10]: So Navi, you get a frown, a collective frown from those of us in studio.

1883
02:02:32,073 --> 02:02:32,333
[SPEAKER_10]: Ready?

1884
02:02:33,754 --> 02:02:37,075
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, and John, do you know what you get for your score tonight?

1885
02:02:38,177 --> 02:02:39,438
[SPEAKER_10]: A frown from the chat room.

1886
02:02:39,598 --> 02:02:43,820
[SPEAKER_10]: No, you get hung up on.

1887
02:02:43,900 --> 02:02:44,620
[SPEAKER_10]: What a good sport.

1888
02:02:44,800 --> 02:02:45,741
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, he tried.

1889
02:02:46,241 --> 02:02:47,441
[SPEAKER_10]: They always fall for it.

1890
02:02:47,481 --> 02:02:48,562
[SPEAKER_10]: I hang up on them every time.

1891
02:02:48,582 --> 02:02:49,402
[SPEAKER_10]: They always fall for it.

1892
02:02:51,604 --> 02:02:53,625
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, no, thanks seriously for playing, John Fields.

1893
02:02:53,645 --> 02:02:54,265
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a good time.

1894
02:02:54,605 --> 02:02:57,887
[SPEAKER_10]: Too bad about the, you know, no answers or anything, but, you know, it happens.

1895
02:02:58,367 --> 02:03:03,710
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, I guess Shark Skrull and Floatwalk are going to have to be leaving us soon because they've got a long drive home.

1896
02:03:04,510 --> 02:03:11,634
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, I quickly wanted to ask Floatwalk and, you know, Shark Skrull just some, you know, general questions.

1897
02:03:13,355 --> 02:03:17,717
[SPEAKER_10]: Floatwalk, anything, I guess I should ask you about

1898
02:03:18,370 --> 02:03:19,311
[SPEAKER_10]: Ultramix 2 Ultramix 2 Ultramix 2

1899
02:03:41,309 --> 02:03:55,814
[SPEAKER_01]: I was hanging out with Jason Enos last night, so he gave us a kind of a scoop on why there were delays and all that kind of stuff, and it's actually pretty funny, but only people who are in the test group would appreciate such bumblings, I guess, for lack of a better term.

1900
02:03:56,234 --> 02:04:02,216
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what, I'm starting to get a little nervous there, that we're going to have to wait for Christmas to see Ultramix 2, but it's good to know that it looks like it's still on target anyway.

1901
02:04:02,617 --> 02:04:04,897
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's looking to be pretty good.

1902
02:04:04,977 --> 02:04:07,998
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, right now, things are pretty happy in the DDR camp.

1903
02:04:08,098 --> 02:04:09,459
[SPEAKER_01]: Extreme sales have actually...

1904
02:04:10,605 --> 02:04:21,229
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what Jason did was he was comparing Max 2 sales along with Xtreme, how they've been doing week by week, and Xtreme's been doing a good, like, up to around 33% better than what Max 2 has been doing.

1905
02:04:21,489 --> 02:04:22,130
[SPEAKER_10]: Very nice!

1906
02:04:22,210 --> 02:04:28,252
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're looking, even projecting around holiday season, they're probably going to be jumping Max 2 figures by about 40%.

1907
02:04:28,352 --> 02:04:28,592
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow!

1908
02:04:28,792 --> 02:04:31,813
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, things are going well for that.

1909
02:04:32,433 --> 02:04:34,794
[SPEAKER_01]: Max 2 has almost hit 500,000 units.

1910
02:04:35,094 --> 02:04:35,515
[SPEAKER_10]: Very nice!

1911
02:04:35,615 --> 02:04:38,956
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I mean, who knows, it could be a greatest hit someday, but

1912
02:04:39,856 --> 02:04:41,116
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting, interesting.

1913
02:04:41,576 --> 02:04:49,058
[SPEAKER_10]: So, what do you think, and I know you're not there anymore, so you can't really say one way or the other because you don't know, but what do you think the chances are we're going to see some kind of Extreme 2 next year?

1914
02:04:50,358 --> 02:05:08,981
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's pretty safe to say, I mean, if it's a profitable franchise, you just keep milking it for what it's worth, and it's, I mean, the good thing about DDR is even though the gameplay is pretty basic, it's always progressive with its music, so the music will always drive sales and people to try new titles.

1915
02:05:09,810 --> 02:05:11,073
[SPEAKER_10]: No, uh, oh, yeah, Loki.

1916
02:05:11,734 --> 02:05:14,721
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully if there is an extreme too, they'll have the sense of humor to make it purple.

1917
02:05:16,872 --> 02:05:17,832
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be very funny.

1918
02:05:17,852 --> 02:05:21,913
[SPEAKER_10]: You've got to let Jason know that from Orange Launch Radio, that we want to make Extreme 2 purple.

1919
02:05:22,633 --> 02:05:23,734
[SPEAKER_10]: If it happens, if it is Extreme 2.

1920
02:05:26,374 --> 02:05:29,615
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, some interesting news that's been going around about Ultramix 2 is the song packs.

1921
02:05:29,715 --> 02:05:32,936
[SPEAKER_10]: They did say on The Freak that there's going to be, what, 7 through 12, I think they said?

1922
02:05:33,536 --> 02:05:34,276
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1923
02:05:34,456 --> 02:05:37,737
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe every month, every other month, we don't really know.

1924
02:05:37,837 --> 02:05:42,658
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just say I wouldn't be surprised if they space them out a little longer than once a month.

1925
02:05:43,138 --> 02:05:43,398
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1926
02:05:43,996 --> 02:05:45,477
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1927
02:05:45,497 --> 02:05:56,444
[SPEAKER_01]: From what I've seen, there's definitely some very interesting choices, like things that the hardcore B-Money people would be very... Oh, so you know about some of the stuff that's coming up.

1928
02:05:56,704 --> 02:05:57,725
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, I know everything.

1929
02:05:57,985 --> 02:05:59,005
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, sorry.

1930
02:06:00,066 --> 02:06:00,586
[SPEAKER_10]: Watch out.

1931
02:06:01,187 --> 02:06:01,487
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

1932
02:06:02,908 --> 02:06:04,249
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1933
02:06:04,309 --> 02:06:07,330
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, anything else you want to share we should be looking forward to from the world of Konami?

1934
02:06:08,551 --> 02:06:12,694
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of hard to say because, I mean, for all intents and purposes, everything's been...

1935
02:06:13,564 --> 02:06:15,605
[SPEAKER_01]: Released out for this fall.

1936
02:06:16,305 --> 02:06:23,748
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably the last game that's going to be pretty big for those who are into the RPGs and 4 will be coming out early January.

1937
02:06:24,049 --> 02:06:24,309
[SPEAKER_10]: Cool.

1938
02:06:24,389 --> 02:06:25,549
[SPEAKER_10]: I got to play a demo with that actually.

1939
02:06:25,569 --> 02:06:26,049
[SPEAKER_10]: It was pretty fun.

1940
02:06:26,610 --> 02:06:26,830
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1941
02:06:27,010 --> 02:06:29,671
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the only cool thing is, you know, I'll get to see my writing in there.

1942
02:06:30,631 --> 02:06:31,332
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, very cool.

1943
02:06:31,432 --> 02:06:37,154
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because me and another guy had actually helped do some translation or like rewriting for that project itself.

1944
02:06:37,494 --> 02:06:37,795
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

1945
02:06:39,056 --> 02:06:45,777
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's main stuff from Konami for now, I mean... Now, are you going to come back after Ultramix 2 is released?

1946
02:06:46,544 --> 02:06:50,705
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you going to come back to the show and kind of, you know, fill us in on how this happened?

1947
02:06:50,945 --> 02:06:53,026
[SPEAKER_10]: Because now, you know, all the information will be out there.

1948
02:06:53,046 --> 02:06:55,087
[SPEAKER_10]: You get to tell us a little bit more about how it all happened?

1949
02:06:55,347 --> 02:06:55,927
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, definitely.

1950
02:06:55,987 --> 02:07:01,969
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'd be more than willing to, you know, come up here and talk about stories of, you know, like songs and like who got to do this.

1951
02:07:02,049 --> 02:07:07,711
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you'll probably find out who did what steps and then like what caused us to think, you know, why we did that pattern and all that kind of stuff.

1952
02:07:07,731 --> 02:07:10,332
[SPEAKER_01]: There are definitely some interesting stories and

1953
02:07:10,612 --> 02:07:18,358
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd be surprised at some of the songs that people like on the V-Rays and stuff, but there were actually some testers who did not want to touch certain songs whatsoever.

1954
02:07:19,239 --> 02:07:20,840
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh, we're going to have to hear about that.

1955
02:07:20,920 --> 02:07:25,063
[SPEAKER_01]: There's plenty of interesting gossip that will go down afterwards.

1956
02:07:25,143 --> 02:07:29,807
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, if I'm not mistaken, though, there's still about half the song list we don't even know yet still.

1957
02:07:30,027 --> 02:07:36,152
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, there's some things that people don't know about, and there's a lot of funny things to...

1958
02:07:36,983 --> 02:07:43,248
[SPEAKER_01]: Although it kind of sucked in a way that the VRare had more or less spoiled some of the things we wanted to keep really top secret.

1959
02:07:44,449 --> 02:07:47,832
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what though, when you stopped giving clues, we had nothing to do.

1960
02:07:49,273 --> 02:07:52,636
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, GameStop employees can't be quiet to save their lives.

1961
02:07:54,721 --> 02:07:58,005
[SPEAKER_10]: Are they ever going to tell us, give us more clues, give us a song list here?

1962
02:07:58,745 --> 02:08:00,247
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably not, because we're only about 10 days out.

1963
02:08:00,327 --> 02:08:01,228
[SPEAKER_01]: It just ain't happening.

1964
02:08:01,388 --> 02:08:01,928
[SPEAKER_10]: You're no fun.

1965
02:08:02,389 --> 02:08:02,809
[SPEAKER_10]: That's alright.

1966
02:08:03,350 --> 02:08:17,984
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I mean, it's... Upper management has been really stressed out from Ultramix 2, just trying to basically get it in before... I mean, our target date was actually probably the second week, basically around the same time Halo 2 was supposed to come out.

1967
02:08:18,004 --> 02:08:19,485
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, 11th we were looking at, but...

1968
02:08:19,991 --> 02:08:23,932
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it got pushed back, but I mean, just kind of stuff happens in the business.

1969
02:08:24,332 --> 02:08:29,474
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, and it's also interesting because we've heard that some things changed with Ultimix 2 as well.

1970
02:08:29,494 --> 02:08:33,755
[SPEAKER_10]: Some song list changes happened, some things behind the scenes, so, you know, maybe they had to go back and do something else.

1971
02:08:33,795 --> 02:08:39,977
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, it's not uncommon to have one song one minute, and then, like, a couple versions later, yeah, we decided not to have it.

1972
02:08:40,117 --> 02:08:45,198
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, people, you know, I think I mentioned one time about Dancing Stage Unleashed, you know, there was supposed to be

1973
02:08:46,643 --> 02:08:52,311
[SPEAKER_01]: A certain song, which was actually slated for the USMAX 2, I think it was Grooves in the Heart.

1974
02:08:53,373 --> 02:08:56,718
[SPEAKER_01]: It was supposed to be on USMAX 2, but just never made it for one reason or another.

1975
02:08:57,339 --> 02:09:00,624
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, of course, you're probably never going to hear from me about what songs didn't make it.

1976
02:09:01,184 --> 02:09:05,968
[SPEAKER_01]: and it would actually, sad part is I do have one to tell, but it just breaks my heart to even think about it.

1977
02:09:06,428 --> 02:09:07,189
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, wow.

1978
02:09:07,429 --> 02:09:08,730
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really good, folks.

1979
02:09:09,191 --> 02:09:09,591
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

1980
02:09:09,871 --> 02:09:14,315
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah, you got me all, you're going to have to, now, see you in a year, nobody will care, so you'll have to tell us in a year.

1981
02:09:14,935 --> 02:09:17,857
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless someone shoots me up with some, like, sodium pentothal or something like that.

1982
02:09:18,198 --> 02:09:18,998
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we can arrange that.

1983
02:09:19,499 --> 02:09:20,059
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1984
02:09:20,159 --> 02:09:21,040
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, thanks for coming by, Mel.

1985
02:09:21,060 --> 02:09:22,141
[SPEAKER_10]: You're welcome back anytime, of course.

1986
02:09:22,481 --> 02:09:22,841
[SPEAKER_01]: SILENTHILL4

1987
02:09:44,145 --> 02:09:45,186
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh, get your pens ready.

1988
02:09:45,206 --> 02:09:49,689
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll have like some kind of certain theme plotted out and then see what people can do with it.

1989
02:09:50,510 --> 02:09:55,733
[SPEAKER_01]: And kind of off topic, my own personal plug, I'm going to be selling a Silent Hill 4 stand-up display.

1990
02:09:56,154 --> 02:10:01,738
[SPEAKER_01]: If anyone wants it, I'll be putting it somewhere on some place and I'll sell it or whatever.

1991
02:10:01,938 --> 02:10:05,080
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll probably post it on the LiveJournal Silent Hill forum.

1992
02:10:05,921 --> 02:10:06,421
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, very nice.

1993
02:10:06,914 --> 02:10:10,195
[SPEAKER_10]: Shark Skrull, I didn't want to neglect you.

1994
02:10:10,235 --> 02:10:12,015
[SPEAKER_10]: You're sitting there and you look kind of bored.

1995
02:10:12,556 --> 02:10:13,216
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm kidding.

1996
02:10:13,276 --> 02:10:14,536
[SPEAKER_21]: I just feel kind of hot.

1997
02:10:14,956 --> 02:10:15,896
[SPEAKER_10]: It is kind of hot in here.

1998
02:10:16,897 --> 02:10:19,657
[SPEAKER_10]: Any exciting plans for the next few weeks for you?

1999
02:10:22,178 --> 02:10:25,599
[SPEAKER_21]: Try not to murder my fellow co-workers that I can't stand.

2000
02:10:26,857 --> 02:10:28,658
[SPEAKER_21]: Try not to walk out on my job because I really need money.

2001
02:10:28,698 --> 02:10:29,158
[SPEAKER_21]: That's about it.

2002
02:10:29,358 --> 02:10:29,698
Okay.

2003
02:10:29,978 --> 02:10:30,658
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I want to come down.

2004
02:10:30,678 --> 02:10:32,779
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, we're going to have Dave and Buster's Play Day pretty soon.

2005
02:10:32,939 --> 02:10:35,180
[SPEAKER_21]: And we can harass a new friend of mine who works there.

2006
02:10:35,400 --> 02:10:36,260
[SPEAKER_10]: Yay, harassment.

2007
02:10:36,520 --> 02:10:37,541
[SPEAKER_21]: Harassment is fun.

2008
02:10:37,921 --> 02:10:39,481
[SPEAKER_10]: And what else am I going to ask you?

2009
02:10:39,981 --> 02:10:40,802
[SPEAKER_10]: How's hockey going?

2010
02:10:41,082 --> 02:10:41,622
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, God.

2011
02:10:41,642 --> 02:10:43,423
[SPEAKER_10]: Does it look like it might get better?

2012
02:10:43,943 --> 02:10:44,123
[SPEAKER_21]: No.

2013
02:10:44,863 --> 02:10:46,123
[SPEAKER_21]: They're being stupid morons.

2014
02:10:46,163 --> 02:10:47,204
[SPEAKER_21]: The players are being idiots.

2015
02:10:47,364 --> 02:10:56,567
[SPEAKER_21]: From what I hear from friends who actually have contacts in the upper level of Sharks management, the owners are willing to negotiate and work on it, and the players aren't.

2016
02:10:56,994 --> 02:10:59,436
[SPEAKER_21]: They're saying, we want what we want, too damn bad.

2017
02:10:59,596 --> 02:11:04,560
[SPEAKER_21]: So, from what I hear, the Sharks are planning that there won't be a season this year.

2018
02:11:04,840 --> 02:11:07,962
[SPEAKER_21]: Which pisses me off, but it saves my wallet.

2019
02:11:08,783 --> 02:11:09,263
[SPEAKER_21]: So, you know, hey.

2020
02:11:09,283 --> 02:11:10,024
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess there's a bright side.

2021
02:11:10,624 --> 02:11:12,286
[SPEAKER_21]: So, yeah, it could be all bad.

2022
02:11:12,646 --> 02:11:17,690
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, if there is a season, like a partial season, like they ended up doing with baseball or something, hope your Sharks can win it.

2023
02:11:18,090 --> 02:11:18,851
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, we're undefeated.

2024
02:11:19,891 --> 02:11:20,472
[SPEAKER_10]: Woo!

2025
02:11:21,773 --> 02:11:22,994
[SPEAKER_21]: Nothing, nothing, we rule.

2026
02:11:23,717 --> 02:11:24,978
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just like our match game tonight.

2027
02:11:25,378 --> 02:11:28,339
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you guys sticking around?

2028
02:11:28,559 --> 02:11:32,381
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you guys going to be taking off too?

2029
02:11:32,421 --> 02:11:35,543
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to talk to Iguana Girl when we get back about a promotion she got recently.

2030
02:11:35,563 --> 02:11:37,284
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to talk to her about what's going on with the Freak.

2031
02:11:37,584 --> 02:11:39,965
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll talk about that when we get back.

2032
02:11:40,005 --> 02:11:40,986
[SPEAKER_10]: We are going to take another break.

2033
02:11:41,466 --> 02:11:42,866
[SPEAKER_10]: How about some more 2DX Red stuff?

2034
02:11:43,487 --> 02:11:51,851
[SPEAKER_10]: Navi, as our resident whore who knows a little bit more about this stuff, why don't you pick some songs for us that you want our chat room to hear?

2035
02:11:54,668 --> 02:11:55,068
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, which one?

2036
02:11:55,208 --> 02:11:55,808
[SPEAKER_10]: What's the, what?

2037
02:11:56,048 --> 02:12:02,470
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, we're going to hear Horizon, and what else do you want to hear?

2038
02:12:03,191 --> 02:12:08,492
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to hear Death Disco, Texture, I'm sorry, It's Lake with Texture.

2039
02:12:12,754 --> 02:12:13,554
[SPEAKER_10]: Do do do do do do.

2040
02:12:14,565 --> 02:12:15,546
[SPEAKER_10]: Wonder Bullfighter.

2041
02:12:15,586 --> 02:12:17,488
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, we're going to hear this 2DX Red music.

2042
02:12:17,848 --> 02:12:21,872
[SPEAKER_10]: And when we come back, we're going to talk to Iguana Girl and Islander a little bit.

2043
02:12:22,112 --> 02:12:24,074
[SPEAKER_10]: And we've got to get the cage match and the FUs in.

2044
02:12:24,094 --> 02:12:25,976
[SPEAKER_10]: We've only got less than an hour of show left.

2045
02:12:25,996 --> 02:12:26,857
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got to squeeze this all in.

2046
02:12:27,257 --> 02:12:28,098
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're going to do that.

2047
02:12:28,698 --> 02:12:29,239
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, wait.

2048
02:12:29,279 --> 02:12:33,283
[SPEAKER_21]: My FU of the week is a two-hour drive to the Bay Area because, damn it, I want to stay here longer.

2049
02:12:33,943 --> 02:12:35,084
[SPEAKER_10]: Aw, I'm sorry, hon.

2050
02:12:35,124 --> 02:12:36,746
[SPEAKER_10]: You just have to take Monday off work sometime.

2051
02:12:37,304 --> 02:12:40,365
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm seriously thinking about calling in tomorrow, but, you know, hey.

2052
02:12:40,785 --> 02:12:46,207
[SPEAKER_10]: But then, you know, someday, someday we're going to bring the show over there to your neck of the woods.

2053
02:12:46,267 --> 02:12:46,967
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got to someday.

2054
02:12:47,587 --> 02:12:49,508
[SPEAKER_10]: So someday when we have a three-day weekend.

2055
02:12:49,548 --> 02:12:51,789
[SPEAKER_10]: Floatwalk, any preemptive FUs you've got to get out for you?

2056
02:12:52,529 --> 02:12:57,390
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man, well, I guess just FU2.

2057
02:12:58,011 --> 02:13:02,292
[SPEAKER_01]: Just FU2, like, game companies putting out too many damn games and just, man.

2058
02:13:03,280 --> 02:13:06,441
[SPEAKER_01]: basically for not giving me enough time to play everything.

2059
02:13:06,781 --> 02:13:17,006
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and FU2, my new job, I was supposed to start Monday, but they said they couldn't start me until Wednesday, and whatever hurts my bank account really just makes you go FU.

2060
02:13:18,406 --> 02:13:18,866
[SPEAKER_10]: I hear that.

2061
02:13:19,407 --> 02:13:20,407
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, guys, thanks for coming.

2062
02:13:20,427 --> 02:13:21,387
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see you later, okay?

2063
02:13:21,508 --> 02:13:22,928
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, most definitely, the sooner the better.

2064
02:13:23,008 --> 02:13:23,488
[SPEAKER_10]: Have a good one.

2065
02:13:23,528 --> 02:13:23,828
[SPEAKER_10]: Here we go.

2066
02:13:23,848 --> 02:13:24,489
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to go to break.

2067
02:13:24,509 --> 02:13:25,029
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll be back.

2068
02:13:25,069 --> 02:13:26,029
[SPEAKER_10]: Show's not over yet, though.

2069
02:13:26,570 --> 02:13:29,291
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm losing a couple people because I've got a long drive, but we've got plenty of show left.

2070
02:13:29,331 --> 02:13:29,751
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll be back.

2071
02:14:36,197 --> 02:14:37,018
Thanks for watching!

2072
02:15:13,028 --> 02:15:13,892
Thanks for watching!

2073
02:17:06,186 --> 02:17:06,907
Thank you!

2074
02:19:34,816 --> 02:19:36,036
[SPEAKER_10]: Orange Lounge Radio.

2075
02:19:36,377 --> 02:19:38,537
[SPEAKER_10]: We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.

2076
02:19:44,259 --> 02:19:46,380
[SPEAKER_10]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2077
02:19:46,440 --> 02:19:47,920
[SPEAKER_10]: We gotta get to the cage.

2078
02:19:47,960 --> 02:19:48,861
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye, Sharks Girl.

2079
02:19:48,881 --> 02:19:49,421
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye, Foot Walk.

2080
02:19:49,441 --> 02:19:49,821
[SPEAKER_10]: Have a good one.

2081
02:19:49,941 --> 02:19:50,381
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for coming.

2082
02:19:51,341 --> 02:19:57,363
[SPEAKER_10]: They got a long drive back, guys, so they're good sports for coming all the way down here to come on our show and eat Mongolian.

2083
02:19:59,244 --> 02:20:03,365
[SPEAKER_10]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2084
02:20:29,173 --> 02:20:30,734
[SPEAKER_10]: But that doesn't mean you replaced J-Dog.

2085
02:20:31,354 --> 02:20:32,475
[SPEAKER_19]: No, no, no, no.

2086
02:20:32,515 --> 02:20:40,860
[SPEAKER_19]: Basically, King of All Cosmos, aka Spike, has not been able to put the amount of time into the site that he would want to.

2087
02:20:40,961 --> 02:20:44,603
[SPEAKER_19]: So he decided to step down and I was put into his place.

2088
02:20:44,783 --> 02:20:50,947
[SPEAKER_19]: So now basically I'm helping out with the forums and keeping things hunky-dory on the forums and whatnot.

2089
02:20:51,207 --> 02:20:52,508
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a hell of an undertaking, I bet.

2090
02:20:53,072 --> 02:20:58,734
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, we've got a lot of projects that we're working on right now and trying to get squared away.

2091
02:20:58,854 --> 02:21:05,456
[SPEAKER_19]: So yeah, it's a lot of stuff to do, but I've got such a wonderful crew that I'm working with.

2092
02:21:05,496 --> 02:21:07,676
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, everybody's just fabulous to work with.

2093
02:21:07,836 --> 02:21:09,177
[SPEAKER_10]: Which includes our very own DarkSakura.

2094
02:21:09,197 --> 02:21:09,377
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

2095
02:21:09,637 --> 02:21:11,259
[SPEAKER_10]: As well as Islanders, next to you over there.

2096
02:21:11,379 --> 02:21:13,000
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, he's our staff member.

2097
02:21:13,020 --> 02:21:15,923
[SPEAKER_10]: And several folks listening tonight, in fact, but judging from our chat.

2098
02:21:15,983 --> 02:21:17,544
[SPEAKER_10]: So, hi you guys, thanks for listening tonight.

2099
02:21:17,564 --> 02:21:19,326
[SPEAKER_19]: VX, JasonXV, and Sherlock.

2100
02:21:19,366 --> 02:21:20,527
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, of course, Jason.

2101
02:21:20,867 --> 02:21:22,909
[SPEAKER_10]: I saw Sherlock blue in there earlier, so that's great.

2102
02:21:23,069 --> 02:21:24,010
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you guys for listening.

2103
02:21:25,851 --> 02:21:30,695
[SPEAKER_10]: I know you probably can't say a whole lot, but anything exciting coming to The Freak in the near future you might look forward to?

2104
02:21:30,715 --> 02:21:30,755
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

2105
02:21:32,697 --> 02:21:35,057
[SPEAKER_19]: Can't really say anything about it right now.

2106
02:21:35,077 --> 02:21:35,898
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, fine.

2107
02:21:36,818 --> 02:21:43,119
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a lot of stuff that's really up in the air, but don't be surprised if you start seeing some changes around the site.

2108
02:21:43,499 --> 02:21:45,419
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh, that's always a good one to leave people with.

2109
02:21:45,639 --> 02:21:46,560
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, yeah.

2110
02:21:46,680 --> 02:21:48,060
[SPEAKER_10]: How did you get involved with that anyway?

2111
02:21:48,120 --> 02:21:55,141
[SPEAKER_10]: Because, you know, I remember that you and I, we had our first DDR experience together at that regular convention.

2112
02:21:55,161 --> 02:21:55,841
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, October 2000, yeah.

2113
02:21:55,961 --> 02:21:58,922
[SPEAKER_10]: And then about a year after that, we weren't talking to each other, and then suddenly...

2114
02:21:59,642 --> 02:22:02,584
[SPEAKER_10]: Suddenly you were running up the corporate ladder, a DDR freak.

2115
02:22:02,604 --> 02:22:03,564
[SPEAKER_10]: How did that happen?

2116
02:22:03,584 --> 02:22:04,085
[SPEAKER_19]: What happened?

2117
02:22:04,445 --> 02:22:27,298
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I, you know, just through the site, I mean, back in the old boards, you know, the green boards, as we, you know, affectionately call them, I started to get to know some people, and Jamie and I were becoming really, really close friends, and what ended up happening was she introduced me to some other people, which introduced me to some other people, which ended up basically with...

2118
02:22:28,078 --> 02:22:32,579
[SPEAKER_19]: I remember seeing the nomination thread and being so proud.

2119
02:22:57,806 --> 02:22:59,187
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't even remember any of that.

2120
02:23:00,448 --> 02:23:03,190
[SPEAKER_19]: I was surprised because it was out of the blue for me.

2121
02:23:03,831 --> 02:23:04,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, good job.

2122
02:23:04,832 --> 02:23:05,932
[SPEAKER_10]: Congratulations to you.

2123
02:23:05,952 --> 02:23:08,074
[SPEAKER_19]: That was August 2001.

2124
02:23:08,214 --> 02:23:14,480
[SPEAKER_10]: Out of curiosity, there have been several mods on DDR Freak that don't mod anymore.

2125
02:23:14,840 --> 02:23:17,782
[SPEAKER_10]: How many of the mods that were there when you started are still there?

2126
02:23:18,803 --> 02:23:19,564
[SPEAKER_10]: I know Jamie's one.

2127
02:23:20,998 --> 02:23:21,379
[SPEAKER_10]: and so on.

2128
02:23:37,968 --> 02:23:38,869
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for watching!

2129
02:24:05,690 --> 02:24:08,793
[SPEAKER_19]: I can't think of too many people.

2130
02:24:20,403 --> 02:24:22,585
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm trying to think.

2131
02:24:22,605 --> 02:24:23,025
[SPEAKER_16]: J-Dog?

2132
02:24:23,585 --> 02:24:27,528
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, J-Dog, he owns the site, so that doesn't really count.

2133
02:24:27,628 --> 02:24:29,509
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting, very interesting.

2134
02:24:30,610 --> 02:24:31,871
[SPEAKER_10]: What else do I want to ask you?

2135
02:24:32,111 --> 02:24:35,974
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, now, just between you and me, because nobody listens to this show, okay?

2136
02:24:35,994 --> 02:24:36,274
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay.

2137
02:24:36,894 --> 02:24:39,936
[SPEAKER_10]: Which forum is the biggest bitch to handle?

2138
02:24:41,918 --> 02:24:44,880
[SPEAKER_19]: See, that's the funny thing, is everybody else... Yeah, see...

2139
02:24:46,505 --> 02:24:51,587
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Islander is, you know, Coffee Gunner is Breath Random Chat, but I don't mind random chat.

2140
02:24:51,707 --> 02:24:52,607
[SPEAKER_19]: Random chat's fun.

2141
02:24:52,667 --> 02:24:53,588
[SPEAKER_19]: I like random chat.

2142
02:24:53,908 --> 02:24:55,689
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, it's like the evolution.

2143
02:24:55,849 --> 02:24:58,130
[SPEAKER_10]: I do too, but I refuse to get involved in political discussions.

2144
02:24:58,150 --> 02:24:59,070
[SPEAKER_19]: See, here's my problem.

2145
02:24:59,750 --> 02:25:02,751
[SPEAKER_19]: My most hated forum would be DDR Chit Chat.

2146
02:25:03,072 --> 02:25:03,412
[SPEAKER_19]: Amen.

2147
02:25:04,312 --> 02:25:09,115
[SPEAKER_19]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2148
02:25:32,671 --> 02:25:34,432
[SPEAKER_09]: How much do you play DDR anymore?

2149
02:25:34,872 --> 02:25:35,192
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't.

2150
02:25:37,113 --> 02:25:42,256
[SPEAKER_19]: Unless you count Thumb Thumb Revolution, I have not played DDR in 2004.

2151
02:25:43,117 --> 02:25:45,578
[SPEAKER_09]: How many of those mods actually play DDR?

2152
02:25:45,658 --> 02:25:46,178
[SPEAKER_19]: Quite a few.

2153
02:25:46,619 --> 02:25:46,879
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

2154
02:25:47,419 --> 02:25:51,441
[SPEAKER_19]: Surprisingly enough, actually it's about a three-quarters split, I would imagine.

2155
02:25:51,701 --> 02:25:53,202
[SPEAKER_09]: So here's the logical follow-up question.

2156
02:25:53,282 --> 02:25:54,443
[SPEAKER_09]: If you don't play DDR anymore...

2157
02:25:55,083 --> 02:25:55,983
[SPEAKER_09]: What the hell are you doing?

2158
02:25:56,563 --> 02:25:57,243
[SPEAKER_19]: It's the community.

2159
02:25:57,484 --> 02:25:57,964
[SPEAKER_19]: It's the community.

2160
02:25:58,404 --> 02:26:01,144
[SPEAKER_19]: All of you dumb fucks out there, I love you to death.

2161
02:26:02,125 --> 02:26:02,585
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm kidding.

2162
02:26:02,705 --> 02:26:04,405
[SPEAKER_30]: You pissed me off, but I love you.

2163
02:26:04,745 --> 02:26:05,205
[SPEAKER_30]: I love you.

2164
02:26:05,245 --> 02:26:05,605
[SPEAKER_30]: Good night.

2165
02:26:05,645 --> 02:26:06,425
[SPEAKER_19]: No, no, seriously.

2166
02:26:07,766 --> 02:26:10,886
[SPEAKER_19]: That's what drew me to it to begin with.

2167
02:26:10,946 --> 02:26:13,387
[SPEAKER_19]: It was just like Rocky for me.

2168
02:26:14,007 --> 02:26:16,868
[SPEAKER_19]: I started out with Rocky because it seemed like it was fun.

2169
02:26:16,908 --> 02:26:17,568
[SPEAKER_19]: I get to go dance.

2170
02:26:18,648 --> 02:26:22,452
[SPEAKER_19]: and so on.

2171
02:26:22,532 --> 02:26:30,260
[SPEAKER_19]: But what kept me there despite everything else was the community, the family that you grow from it.

2172
02:26:30,460 --> 02:26:41,751
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's honestly been the best experience about DDR for me was the camaraderie that I've felt, you know, this big huge happy

2173
02:26:42,645 --> 02:26:43,005
[SPEAKER_19]: I love it.

2174
02:27:13,095 --> 02:27:17,881
[SPEAKER_19]: and oh my god, maybe Orange Lounge and DDR Freak Radio crossovers?

2175
02:27:19,202 --> 02:27:19,863
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't say that.

2176
02:27:21,324 --> 02:27:27,451
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't say it, but I'm neither going to confirm nor deny those reports.

2177
02:27:31,172 --> 02:27:32,073
[SPEAKER_10]: We shall soon see.

2178
02:27:32,133 --> 02:27:34,095
[SPEAKER_10]: It could be some interesting things happening this November.

2179
02:27:34,735 --> 02:27:35,076
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

2180
02:27:35,216 --> 02:27:35,676
[SPEAKER_20]: Possibly.

2181
02:27:35,876 --> 02:27:36,257
[SPEAKER_10]: Possibly.

2182
02:27:36,457 --> 02:27:36,757
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2183
02:27:38,318 --> 02:27:47,226
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Islander, I don't want to leave you out of the fun because we're talking to a Gwana girl, but you were one of the first people on DDR Freak, weren't you?

2184
02:27:47,506 --> 02:27:47,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2185
02:27:48,027 --> 02:27:51,170
[SPEAKER_09]: How did this whole damn phenomenon get started?

2186
02:27:52,711 --> 02:27:57,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, story goes, there was a group of guys that I saw playing

2187
02:27:57,694 --> 02:28:01,217
[SPEAKER_02]: DDR, you know, way back in the day at Milpitas Golf Land.

2188
02:28:01,277 --> 02:28:02,438
[SPEAKER_02]: First time I ever saw this machine.

2189
02:28:03,438 --> 02:28:06,381
[SPEAKER_02]: And I started noticing, I started seeing the same people over and over again.

2190
02:28:06,501 --> 02:28:07,261
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, i.e.

2191
02:28:07,301 --> 02:28:13,986
[SPEAKER_02]: Floatwalk, who was just here earlier, just left actually, J-Dog, Pokai Kenobi.

2192
02:28:14,827 --> 02:28:16,508
[SPEAKER_02]: And we started talking to one another.

2193
02:28:18,010 --> 02:28:20,692
[SPEAKER_02]: And we started seeing each other more and more and more.

2194
02:28:21,292 --> 02:28:26,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Next thing I know, Jason comes up with a website

2195
02:28:26,997 --> 02:28:28,378
[SPEAKER_02]: with a huge long URL.

2196
02:28:29,559 --> 02:28:33,203
[SPEAKER_02]: It was something at Berkeley, EDU, and da-da-da-da-da-da.

2197
02:28:33,763 --> 02:28:35,605
[SPEAKER_10]: Sad thing is, I remember that site.

2198
02:28:35,625 --> 02:28:36,205
[SPEAKER_10]: You remember that?

2199
02:28:36,325 --> 02:28:37,666
[SPEAKER_10]: It was horrible.

2200
02:28:37,707 --> 02:28:41,730
[SPEAKER_09]: No, when I first used it, NS3, it was the NS3 site that we came on board with.

2201
02:28:41,790 --> 02:28:42,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the N3.net.

2202
02:28:42,571 --> 02:28:43,331
[SPEAKER_02]: N3.net was next.

2203
02:28:44,252 --> 02:28:49,657
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just kind of progressed from there, how quickly people caught on and how much people loved it.

2204
02:28:49,857 --> 02:28:54,001
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's really amazing how much the site has really grown.

2205
02:28:55,546 --> 02:28:56,126
[SPEAKER_02]: It is amazing.

2206
02:28:56,327 --> 02:28:59,249
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, my God.

2207
02:28:59,669 --> 02:29:00,069
[SPEAKER_19]: 45,000 members.

2208
02:29:00,650 --> 02:29:01,350
[SPEAKER_10]: How many hits a day?

2209
02:29:02,771 --> 02:29:04,773
[SPEAKER_19]: I wouldn't even know what the stats are, to be honest.

2210
02:29:04,833 --> 02:29:06,174
[SPEAKER_19]: But let me put it this way.

2211
02:29:06,214 --> 02:29:17,382
[SPEAKER_19]: The reason why we can't keep the video section up is the sheer amount of bandwidth that is used would cost us probably a good $500 a month in hosting fees alone.

2212
02:29:18,004 --> 02:29:18,845
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, I got a good idea.

2213
02:29:18,945 --> 02:29:19,325
[SPEAKER_10]: At least.

2214
02:29:19,405 --> 02:29:22,368
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys should do one of those Winamp TV things with streaming videos.

2215
02:29:22,648 --> 02:29:23,469
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be kind of cute.

2216
02:29:23,870 --> 02:29:24,090
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe.

2217
02:29:25,071 --> 02:29:25,351
[SPEAKER_09]: Possibly.

2218
02:29:25,371 --> 02:29:27,233
[SPEAKER_09]: Just remember, I suggested it, okay?

2219
02:29:27,273 --> 02:29:28,314
[SPEAKER_09]: I want my credit.

2220
02:29:29,155 --> 02:29:39,825
[SPEAKER_19]: And a lot of people have suggested BitTorrent for it, but part of the problem with that is, A, we're talking about the common user here.

2221
02:29:40,496 --> 02:29:42,798
[SPEAKER_19]: and a lot of common users aren't going to be able to figure out BitTorrent.

2222
02:29:43,098 --> 02:29:44,319
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, at least right now.

2223
02:29:44,419 --> 02:29:45,479
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, at least for right now.

2224
02:29:45,519 --> 02:29:49,262
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, obviously, you know, things like IRC were foreign to people back in the day.

2225
02:29:49,442 --> 02:29:53,405
[SPEAKER_10]: If you haven't guessed, DDR Freak has to cater to the lowest common denominator sometimes.

2226
02:29:53,485 --> 02:29:54,505
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, unfortunately.

2227
02:29:54,625 --> 02:29:58,628
[SPEAKER_24]: As in, no, I'm going to be high school.

2228
02:29:58,668 --> 02:29:59,989
[SPEAKER_10]: No naming names, DarkSakura.

2229
02:30:00,329 --> 02:30:01,130
[SPEAKER_24]: I wasn't going to name names.

2230
02:30:01,150 --> 02:30:02,350
[SPEAKER_24]: I was just going to say complete idiots.

2231
02:30:02,470 --> 02:30:02,971
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

2232
02:30:03,851 --> 02:30:06,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, you know, as she said, the newbies, which I actually love.

2233
02:30:07,072 --> 02:30:12,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Some newbies are cute!

2234
02:30:12,854 --> 02:30:20,196
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go to the site, I am still listed as the DDR Amstabor.

2235
02:30:20,737 --> 02:30:31,160
[SPEAKER_02]: See, one of the things I loved to do way back when was I loved to go to various arcades, talk to people, get them interested, and I just loved going around meeting people

2236
02:30:31,923 --> 02:30:32,503
[SPEAKER_02]: who played the game.

2237
02:30:32,904 --> 02:30:39,028
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, when the Sacramento crew came down to the Bay Area and everybody hated us.

2238
02:30:39,568 --> 02:30:40,289
[SPEAKER_02]: You remember that?

2239
02:30:40,409 --> 02:30:42,030
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that was funny.

2240
02:30:42,090 --> 02:30:43,491
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to point this out.

2241
02:30:44,032 --> 02:30:50,917
[SPEAKER_10]: We were the bastard children of the DDR community for the longest time and now she's the queen of the goddamn forum.

2242
02:30:51,197 --> 02:30:52,238
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to point that out.

2243
02:30:52,738 --> 02:30:54,179
[SPEAKER_10]: That is hilarious to me.

2244
02:30:54,519 --> 02:30:57,081
[SPEAKER_10]: Meanwhile, the people that chastised us are banned!

2245
02:30:58,542 --> 02:30:59,402
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember Prestige!

2246
02:31:27,239 --> 02:31:29,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yes, he was there too.

2247
02:31:29,643 --> 02:31:30,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, a lot of names.

2248
02:31:31,145 --> 02:31:32,007
[SPEAKER_02]: And you were there?

2249
02:31:32,688 --> 02:31:33,549
[SPEAKER_02]: And you were there?

2250
02:31:33,569 --> 02:31:33,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2251
02:31:34,130 --> 02:31:35,172
[SPEAKER_02]: And you were there?

2252
02:31:35,673 --> 02:31:36,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

2253
02:31:36,815 --> 02:31:37,115
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2254
02:31:39,339 --> 02:31:39,499
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

2255
02:31:40,080 --> 02:31:41,301
[SPEAKER_19]: He said I had big tits.

2256
02:31:42,862 --> 02:31:43,182
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

2257
02:31:44,103 --> 02:31:47,385
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate to kind of cut this short, but you guys are welcome back anytime.

2258
02:31:48,245 --> 02:31:49,566
[SPEAKER_10]: You're actually welcome in this house again.

2259
02:31:50,307 --> 02:31:51,207
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god!

2260
02:31:52,048 --> 02:31:53,129
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I'm just messing with you.

2261
02:31:53,589 --> 02:31:55,590
[SPEAKER_10]: I love this, that we can just be candid about it.

2262
02:31:55,630 --> 02:31:56,170
[SPEAKER_10]: It's funny.

2263
02:31:56,311 --> 02:31:56,871
[SPEAKER_10]: Life's funny.

2264
02:31:57,291 --> 02:31:58,312
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what it boils down to.

2265
02:31:58,332 --> 02:31:59,653
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, things change.

2266
02:31:59,813 --> 02:32:00,073
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

2267
02:32:00,573 --> 02:32:04,536
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, don't you go anywhere, Navi, because I want to talk to you still, too, after we get the cage match.

2268
02:32:04,556 --> 02:32:05,336
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got to get to the cage match.

2269
02:32:05,356 --> 02:32:06,777
[SPEAKER_10]: We've only got like 30 minutes left in the show.

2270
02:32:07,258 --> 02:32:07,678
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god.

2271
02:32:07,698 --> 02:32:07,798
[SPEAKER_10]: Huh?

2272
02:32:09,248 --> 02:32:11,589
[SPEAKER_10]: Did Jamie just say we skip FUs?

2273
02:32:11,609 --> 02:32:14,531
[SPEAKER_24]: We should skip FUs so that next week I can do double FUs.

2274
02:32:15,712 --> 02:32:16,592
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know about that, Jamie.

2275
02:32:16,772 --> 02:32:18,733
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe we'll have to do a mini FU segment.

2276
02:32:18,833 --> 02:32:20,734
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody will have to think of one really good FU.

2277
02:32:20,814 --> 02:32:21,615
[SPEAKER_24]: One really good FU.

2278
02:32:21,695 --> 02:32:22,875
[SPEAKER_10]: And that goes for chat room, too.

2279
02:32:22,895 --> 02:32:25,877
[SPEAKER_10]: You only get one really good FU tonight.

2280
02:32:26,117 --> 02:32:29,238
[SPEAKER_10]: But in the meanwhile, we've got to, got to, got to get to tonight's cage match.

2281
02:32:29,679 --> 02:32:32,040
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm going to queue it up here.

2282
02:32:32,200 --> 02:32:33,881
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you want to participate in tonight's cage match...

2283
02:32:34,201 --> 02:32:41,405
[SPEAKER_10]: All you got to do is head on over to our chat room over at www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on chat.

2284
02:32:41,445 --> 02:32:46,067
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's bring on the cage match music, Jamie's favorite song.

2285
02:32:47,708 --> 02:32:48,568
[SPEAKER_24]: I vote for Holic.

2286
02:32:49,629 --> 02:32:51,170
[SPEAKER_10]: You cannot vote for Holic.

2287
02:32:51,810 --> 02:32:52,690
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm still voting for Holic.

2288
02:32:52,771 --> 02:32:53,371
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't care.

2289
02:32:54,732 --> 02:32:55,092
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2290
02:32:56,913 --> 02:32:59,114
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, your FU suggestion got FU'd, Jamie.

2291
02:33:01,275 --> 02:33:01,795
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, anyway.

2292
02:33:01,815 --> 02:33:03,276
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, well, F you, buddy.

2293
02:33:03,516 --> 02:33:05,057
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, we'll see what happens.

2294
02:33:05,077 --> 02:33:05,657
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see what happens.

2295
02:33:05,737 --> 02:33:06,317
[SPEAKER_10]: Anything's possible.

2296
02:33:06,357 --> 02:33:08,198
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see how fast we can get through this cage match.

2297
02:33:08,238 --> 02:33:12,399
[SPEAKER_10]: Last week in the Orange Lounge cage match, it didn't happen because we weren't here, because we had Halloween.

2298
02:33:12,439 --> 02:33:15,640
[SPEAKER_10]: So, for two weeks running, you have had my pick.

2299
02:33:15,740 --> 02:33:18,061
[SPEAKER_10]: My pick was the winner of the Orange Lounge radio cage match.

2300
02:33:18,521 --> 02:33:22,082
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a song by Ian Van Dow, which you know from Castle's Nurse.

2301
02:33:22,182 --> 02:33:23,623
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

2302
02:33:50,632 --> 02:33:55,836
[SPEAKER_10]: The whole guest here, we get to do our best Simon Cowell on all the songs that play, except for last week's, because we already did it last week.

2303
02:33:55,876 --> 02:33:59,599
[SPEAKER_10]: So, alright, I'll shut up and play a clip of song number one.

2304
02:33:59,759 --> 02:34:00,779
[SPEAKER_10]: It is last week's winner.

2305
02:34:00,879 --> 02:34:02,601
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Reason by Ian Vandal.

2306
02:34:24,839 --> 02:34:26,180
Music, Music, Music

2307
02:35:20,649 --> 02:35:23,430
[SPEAKER_15]: Are there things that I should know?

2308
02:35:24,350 --> 02:35:27,010
[SPEAKER_15]: Will you stay or will you go?

2309
02:35:29,051 --> 02:35:30,211
[SPEAKER_16]: Where is the love?

2310
02:35:40,173 --> 02:35:43,714
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, that was song number one, last week's winner, or two weeks ago's winner, I should say.

2311
02:35:43,734 --> 02:35:48,255
[SPEAKER_10]: That was Ian Van Dow from the album Ace with Reason, some happy poppy trance music.

2312
02:35:48,295 --> 02:35:49,035
[SPEAKER_10]: Jamie's favorite!

2313
02:35:51,709 --> 02:35:52,350
[SPEAKER_10]: You gave that song an 8.

2314
02:35:52,430 --> 02:35:53,613
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to remind you.

2315
02:35:53,713 --> 02:35:54,014
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

2316
02:35:54,535 --> 02:35:54,916
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, you did.

2317
02:35:55,136 --> 02:35:55,437
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

2318
02:35:56,539 --> 02:35:58,764
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go on and we're going to go to Loki's pick for tonight.

2319
02:35:58,804 --> 02:35:59,906
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, what did you pick out tonight?

2320
02:36:01,167 --> 02:36:04,610
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I figured I'd get something really sweet for you guys.

2321
02:36:06,511 --> 02:36:13,956
[SPEAKER_10]: Earlier in the show, you heard me mention MidiHead, basically the guy that did the really kick-ass remix of In Your Eyes.

2322
02:36:14,297 --> 02:36:17,359
[SPEAKER_10]: And, well, I got another track from him.

2323
02:36:17,479 --> 02:36:22,883
[SPEAKER_10]: You won't even find this on his website, because I asked him for it, and he was laying it up to send to me.

2324
02:36:22,923 --> 02:36:24,544
[SPEAKER_10]: And your internet penis is humongous.

2325
02:36:24,744 --> 02:36:25,365
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, it is.

2326
02:36:26,045 --> 02:36:32,451
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways, this song is featured in one of the trailers, or not, I should say TV spots for Matrix Reloaded.

2327
02:36:33,212 --> 02:36:37,796
[SPEAKER_10]: And the song is called, um, I don't know what it is, Speed Demon.

2328
02:36:38,276 --> 02:36:42,860
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's by a group, or a guy called Monolithic, and guess who Monolithic is?

2329
02:36:42,940 --> 02:36:45,343
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Middy Head, and he's the singer, and enjoy.

2330
02:36:45,363 --> 02:36:49,967
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, here it is, song number two tonight, Monolithic, Speed Demon, enjoy.

2331
02:37:49,541 --> 02:37:50,823
Thanks for watching!

2332
02:40:17,213 --> 02:40:18,054
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks for watching!

2333
02:41:36,114 --> 02:41:38,135
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, that was song number two in tonight's cage match.

2334
02:41:38,155 --> 02:41:40,495
[SPEAKER_10]: That was Monolithic with Speed Demon.

2335
02:41:40,535 --> 02:41:42,436
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to go around and see what everybody thought of that one.

2336
02:41:42,456 --> 02:41:47,357
[SPEAKER_10]: Keep in mind, we're all a little pooped right now, so I don't know how that may affect the scores, but let's see.

2337
02:41:47,397 --> 02:41:48,017
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.

2338
02:41:49,478 --> 02:41:51,718
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not bad.

2339
02:41:52,679 --> 02:41:53,359
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not bad.

2340
02:41:54,508 --> 02:41:58,209
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll give it a seven and a half.

2341
02:41:58,670 --> 02:41:59,490
[SPEAKER_29]: Alright, seven and a half.

2342
02:41:59,530 --> 02:42:00,570
[SPEAKER_29]: Let's see, Guana Girl.

2343
02:42:01,571 --> 02:42:05,892
[SPEAKER_20]: Sounds like the type of stuff I actually used to listen to, so I'm probably going to give it about seven and a half also.

2344
02:42:06,152 --> 02:42:07,433
[SPEAKER_29]: Alright, seven and a half from Guana Girl.

2345
02:42:07,493 --> 02:42:07,793
[SPEAKER_29]: Islander.

2346
02:42:09,494 --> 02:42:11,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, not my style, but I still enjoyed it anyway.

2347
02:42:11,654 --> 02:42:12,795
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd probably still give it a seven.

2348
02:42:13,215 --> 02:42:14,095
[SPEAKER_29]: Alright, good deal.

2349
02:42:14,155 --> 02:42:14,375
[SPEAKER_29]: Navi.

2350
02:42:15,616 --> 02:42:18,277
[SPEAKER_07]: The music was pretty good, but then the vocals kind of ruined it for me.

2351
02:42:18,297 --> 02:42:21,858
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounded like Bad Underworld with the cowboy twang, so I give it a seven.

2352
02:42:22,699 --> 02:42:23,599
[SPEAKER_07]: Arcadian.

2353
02:42:25,390 --> 02:42:28,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the background was good, but the guy's saying leave something to be desired.

2354
02:42:28,871 --> 02:42:28,751
6.5.

2355
02:42:30,572 --> 02:42:33,293
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I've always, I think MidiHead's a really talented guy.

2356
02:42:33,513 --> 02:42:37,335
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I prefer the In My Eyes remix over that, but it's got a good beat.

2357
02:42:37,455 --> 02:42:40,937
[SPEAKER_10]: I think cut down a little bit, that would be like a fun little 2DX song or something.

2358
02:42:41,537 --> 02:42:42,617
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, yeah, right.

2359
02:42:42,637 --> 02:42:44,658
[SPEAKER_10]: 2DX is going to come out here.

2360
02:42:44,898 --> 02:42:47,499
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, so I give it like a 7.5 as well.

2361
02:42:47,919 --> 02:42:48,180
[SPEAKER_10]: Why not?

2362
02:42:48,220 --> 02:42:49,100
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll be trending.

2363
02:42:50,321 --> 02:42:53,682
[SPEAKER_10]: It's better with the Matrix reloaded visuals with it.

2364
02:42:54,184 --> 02:42:55,124
[SPEAKER_10]: But I still gave it a 9.

2365
02:42:55,184 --> 02:42:56,525
[SPEAKER_10]: That's awesome.

2366
02:42:56,565 --> 02:43:00,647
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, remember, it doesn't matter what we think, it's all up to you guys.

2367
02:43:00,667 --> 02:43:05,469
[SPEAKER_10]: You can choose between Ian Vandal, that song, and DarkSakura's song, which we're going to hear next.

2368
02:43:05,509 --> 02:43:06,549
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, what is it?

2369
02:43:07,550 --> 02:43:11,912
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, it's by someone named Vlad.

2370
02:43:12,272 --> 02:43:14,113
[SPEAKER_24]: It's Supersonic Electronics.

2371
02:43:15,493 --> 02:43:15,613
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

2372
02:43:15,633 --> 02:43:21,256
[SPEAKER_24]: If anyone happens to be checking random chat on GDR Freaks, they'll know what I was talking about.

2373
02:43:22,236 --> 02:43:24,517
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm a little concerned, but we'll see.

2374
02:43:24,677 --> 02:43:28,678
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, this is Vlad with Electronic Supersonic.

2375
02:43:28,818 --> 02:43:29,218
[SPEAKER_10]: Enjoy.

2376
02:43:32,399 --> 02:43:34,880
[SPEAKER_26]: Hey baby, wake up from your sleep.

2377
02:43:35,260 --> 02:43:46,944
[SPEAKER_26]: We have arrived onto the future and the whole world is become... Electronic Supersonic Supersonic

2378
02:43:48,033 --> 02:44:13,989
[SPEAKER_26]: Electronic Hey baby, ride with me away, we doesn't have much time My blue jeans is tight, so on to my love rocket climb Inside tank of fuel is not fuel, but love Above us, there is nothing above, but the stars above All systems gone, prepare for down count 5, 4, 3, 1

2379
02:44:16,465 --> 02:44:18,567
[SPEAKER_26]: Fly away in my space rocket.

2380
02:44:19,988 --> 02:44:22,350
[SPEAKER_26]: You no need put money in my pocket.

2381
02:44:24,051 --> 02:44:25,953
[SPEAKER_26]: The door is closed, I just lock it.

2382
02:44:27,974 --> 02:44:29,996
[SPEAKER_26]: I put my code plug in your socket.

2383
02:44:30,376 --> 02:44:34,800
[SPEAKER_16]: The sun and sky is bright like fire.

2384
02:44:35,300 --> 02:44:37,362
[SPEAKER_25]: You and me gets higher and higher.

2385
02:44:42,944 --> 02:44:46,307
[SPEAKER_26]: The only thing can stop us is flat iron.

2386
02:44:49,730 --> 02:44:53,392
[SPEAKER_26]: Hey, love crusader, I want to be your space invader.

2387
02:44:53,693 --> 02:44:56,595
[SPEAKER_26]: For you I would descend the deepest moon crater.

2388
02:44:56,995 --> 02:44:59,337
[SPEAKER_26]: I is more stronger than dark vapor.

2389
02:44:59,677 --> 02:45:02,219
[SPEAKER_26]: Obey me, I is your new dictator.

2390
02:45:02,560 --> 02:45:04,501
[SPEAKER_26]: For you is Venus, I am Mars.

2391
02:45:04,782 --> 02:45:07,524
[SPEAKER_26]: With you I is more richer than all the stars.

2392
02:45:07,844 --> 02:45:09,625
[SPEAKER_26]: Make a wishes on a shooting stars.

2393
02:45:09,846 --> 02:45:11,647
[SPEAKER_26]: Then for you I will play on my cosmic power.

2394
02:45:14,145 --> 02:45:17,026
[SPEAKER_27]: Ladies and gentlemen, fasten your belt seats.

2395
02:45:17,426 --> 02:45:18,906
[SPEAKER_27]: We have commenced our descent.

2396
02:45:19,487 --> 02:45:23,708
[SPEAKER_27]: I trust you enjoy this flight as much as you enjoy this accent.

2397
02:45:23,808 --> 02:45:27,009
[SPEAKER_26]: Now, back on Earth, it's time for a down splash.

2398
02:45:27,449 --> 02:45:30,610
[SPEAKER_26]: Into sea of eternal glory, my spaceship crash.

2399
02:45:31,110 --> 02:45:34,191
[SPEAKER_26]: People have arrived to cheer me from near and far.

2400
02:45:34,211 --> 02:45:39,513
[SPEAKER_26]: And as I float, I open door and shout, I am world's biggest warship.

2401
02:45:44,173 --> 02:45:45,056
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks for watching!

2402
02:46:10,095 --> 02:46:11,837
[SPEAKER_26]: Long live Space Race.

2403
02:46:12,477 --> 02:46:13,278
[SPEAKER_26]: Long live Movania.

2404
02:46:39,201 --> 02:46:42,323
[SPEAKER_24]: I just cracked up when I first heard that, so I give it a 10.

2405
02:46:43,443 --> 02:46:44,123
[SPEAKER_29]: Iguana Girl.

2406
02:46:46,865 --> 02:46:48,806
[SPEAKER_19]: It's got a nice rhythm and you can dance to it.

2407
02:46:51,407 --> 02:46:48,806
9.

2408
02:46:51,587 --> 02:46:51,987
[SPEAKER_34]: Islander.

2409
02:46:55,089 --> 02:46:56,249
[SPEAKER_34]: I thoroughly enjoyed that.

2410
02:46:56,349 --> 02:46:56,930
[SPEAKER_34]: What can I say?

2411
02:46:57,030 --> 02:46:57,250
[SPEAKER_34]: It's a 10.

2412
02:46:59,111 --> 02:46:59,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Navi.

2413
02:46:59,935 --> 02:47:03,682
[SPEAKER_07]: It makes me giggle like when I heard heterosexuality by Army of Lovers.

2414
02:47:04,183 --> 02:47:05,946
[SPEAKER_07]: It gets a 10 because it has to win.

2415
02:47:05,966 --> 02:47:07,890
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, Arcadia.

2416
02:47:09,292 --> 02:47:10,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Very funny.

2417
02:47:10,975 --> 02:47:11,536
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give it a 9.

2418
02:47:16,717 --> 02:47:20,158
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, this is something I would expect from Loki, not from you.

2419
02:47:20,758 --> 02:47:24,499
[SPEAKER_10]: But, based on the butt plug in my socket line, 10.

2420
02:47:26,600 --> 02:47:26,960
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki.

2421
02:47:28,180 --> 02:47:30,041
[SPEAKER_10]: And people wonder why Push got elected.

2422
02:47:32,161 --> 02:47:32,762
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess a 1.

2423
02:47:33,282 --> 02:47:38,003
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, it would be a better fortune cookie song than it would be a cage match song.

2424
02:47:38,669 --> 02:47:39,490
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh, somebody jealous.

2425
02:47:39,650 --> 02:47:40,271
[SPEAKER_09]: Someone jealous?

2426
02:47:40,471 --> 02:47:41,352
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's see.

2427
02:47:41,972 --> 02:47:44,415
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's recap and then you guys can place your votes.

2428
02:47:44,455 --> 02:47:44,895

2430
02:47:57,428 --> 02:48:02,413
[SPEAKER_10]: Song number two you can vote for tonight is Monolithic with Speed Demon.

2431
02:48:13,846 --> 02:48:18,107
[SPEAKER_10]: and song number three you can vote for tonight is Zlod with Electronic Supersonic.

2432
02:48:27,030 --> 02:48:29,991
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, place vote now.

2433
02:48:30,171 --> 02:48:33,351

2434
02:48:33,592 --> 02:48:37,433
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't have a lot of time tonight, guys, because we want to get into the FU segment pretty soon here.

2435
02:48:37,833 --> 02:48:39,053
[SPEAKER_10]: So get those votes in now.

2436
02:48:39,093 --> 02:48:39,933
[SPEAKER_10]: You've got like a minute.

2437
02:48:40,033 --> 02:48:41,034
[SPEAKER_10]: So do it, do it, do it.

2438
02:48:41,994 --> 02:48:42,294
[SPEAKER_10]: Do it!

2439
02:48:44,121 --> 02:48:44,641
[SPEAKER_10]: Do it now!

2440
02:48:45,301 --> 02:48:45,602
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2441
02:48:46,482 --> 02:48:52,944
[SPEAKER_10]: While we go ahead and open up the Skype line, maybe some folks out there have some questions, want to speak to some of our guests that are left here in studio.

2442
02:48:52,984 --> 02:48:56,225
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if anyone's going to actually call, but we'll see here.

2443
02:48:56,845 --> 02:48:57,666
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to take a... What?

2444
02:48:57,966 --> 02:48:59,066
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to do a sim update.

2445
02:48:59,666 --> 02:49:01,267
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, Loki, what's going on in the sim world?

2446
02:49:04,888 --> 02:49:12,551
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, there's been updates to both the in-the-group skin, no one cares, and the DDR red skin, which is meh.

2447
02:49:13,275 --> 02:49:19,258
[SPEAKER_10]: and also Step Mania, Release Candidate 2 came out.

2448
02:49:19,378 --> 02:49:19,878
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, that's it.

2449
02:49:21,318 --> 02:49:21,939
[SPEAKER_10]: Nothing important.

2450
02:49:22,499 --> 02:49:23,019
[SPEAKER_10]: Nothing to see here.

2451
02:49:23,099 --> 02:49:23,539
[SPEAKER_10]: Move along.

2452
02:49:26,140 --> 02:49:27,041
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that was quick.

2453
02:49:27,221 --> 02:49:27,981
[SPEAKER_10]: What can I say about that?

2454
02:49:29,542 --> 02:49:30,762
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

2455
02:49:31,283 --> 02:49:39,186
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I guess what we can do right now while I'm tallying cage match votes, Jamie, why don't you go ahead and plug some of those other shows that you can hear on our lovely station.

2456
02:49:39,522 --> 02:49:41,264
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sure there's people who would like to give it the plug.

2457
02:49:41,484 --> 02:49:42,745
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, oh, I'm sorry.

2458
02:49:43,586 --> 02:49:47,810
[SPEAKER_24]: Tuesday night is my show, Pump Up the Volume, starts at 7 o'clock.

2459
02:49:48,010 --> 02:49:48,310
[SPEAKER_10]: Yo!

2460
02:49:48,370 --> 02:49:50,973
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to cut you off real fast because we just got a call on the Skype line.

2461
02:49:51,934 --> 02:49:52,574
[SPEAKER_24]: Too bad!

2462
02:49:52,934 --> 02:49:55,096
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll finish your plug, then we'll go to the Skype line.

2463
02:49:55,437 --> 02:49:56,057
[SPEAKER_24]: Never mind, I'm done.

2464
02:49:56,598 --> 02:49:56,918
[SPEAKER_10]: Fine.

2465
02:49:58,019 --> 02:49:59,180
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Silence Radio.

2466
02:49:59,200 --> 02:49:59,520
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

2467
02:50:00,021 --> 02:50:00,521
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, what's up?

2468
02:50:00,581 --> 02:50:01,142
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Sherlock.

2469
02:50:01,362 --> 02:50:02,063
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, Sherlock.

2470
02:50:02,083 --> 02:50:02,543
[SPEAKER_10]: How are you?

2471
02:50:03,184 --> 02:50:03,524
[SPEAKER_10]: Pat!

2472
02:50:03,544 --> 02:50:04,685
[SPEAKER_10]: How's it going tonight?

2473
02:50:04,805 --> 02:50:05,126
[SPEAKER_22]: Pat!

2474
02:50:07,099 --> 02:50:07,719
[SPEAKER_10]: We are good.

2475
02:50:07,779 --> 02:50:11,142
[SPEAKER_10]: We're pressed for time, but we're doing pretty well, all things considered.

2476
02:50:12,683 --> 02:50:13,663
[SPEAKER_10]: What's on your mind, Shark?

2477
02:50:15,004 --> 02:50:16,365
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't like the other two songs.

2478
02:50:17,045 --> 02:50:19,367
[SPEAKER_13]: I think Ian Vandal is probably the winner here.

2479
02:50:20,027 --> 02:50:20,508
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

2480
02:50:20,808 --> 02:50:24,010
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, see, I have a feeling that they're going to go for the funny one.

2481
02:50:25,211 --> 02:50:26,592
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, I just don't like it.

2482
02:50:26,792 --> 02:50:28,713
[SPEAKER_10]: Was it not funny to you, or what was up with it?

2483
02:50:30,262 --> 02:50:31,903
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I'm annoyed by German techno.

2484
02:50:31,943 --> 02:50:33,483
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just that amusing.

2485
02:50:33,783 --> 02:50:34,463
[SPEAKER_10]: Aren't we all?

2486
02:50:34,883 --> 02:50:36,184
[SPEAKER_10]: Wouldn't the world be a better place?

2487
02:50:37,124 --> 02:50:40,505
[SPEAKER_09]: The only German songs we should be listening to should be by Rammstein!

2488
02:50:40,785 --> 02:50:42,606
[SPEAKER_10]: That's in Germany, alright?

2489
02:50:42,746 --> 02:50:43,706
[SPEAKER_10]: Let it stay there.

2490
02:50:43,906 --> 02:50:45,247
[SPEAKER_10]: Wasn't erotic from Germany?

2491
02:50:45,267 --> 02:50:46,587
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe so.

2492
02:50:46,767 --> 02:50:47,367
[SPEAKER_10]: Enough said.

2493
02:50:48,788 --> 02:50:54,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly, that's probably the only song that we should have heard from... No, because Rammstein is considered Eurodance.

2494
02:50:54,329 --> 02:50:56,370
[SPEAKER_13]: The last time I checked, Germany wasn't in Europe.

2495
02:50:58,086 --> 02:50:59,226
[SPEAKER_09]: Germany's not in Europe?

2496
02:51:02,147 --> 02:51:03,487
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, anyway.

2497
02:51:03,607 --> 02:51:07,008
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you have a question for any of our guests that are here tonight?

2498
02:51:07,048 --> 02:51:08,128
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got a guana girl.

2499
02:51:08,529 --> 02:51:10,669
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, you're a mod over on The Freak, right?

2500
02:51:11,069 --> 02:51:11,669
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I am.

2501
02:51:12,830 --> 02:51:14,190
[SPEAKER_10]: How is it working for a guana girl?

2502
02:51:14,210 --> 02:51:15,990
[SPEAKER_10]: Does she carry an iron fist or what?

2503
02:51:17,151 --> 02:51:18,791
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, she keeps an iron fist pretty well.

2504
02:51:19,151 --> 02:51:20,572
[SPEAKER_13]: She keeps a check on me all the time.

2505
02:51:20,632 --> 02:51:21,972
[SPEAKER_10]: I know she's got an iron bra.

2506
02:51:23,730 --> 02:51:27,017
[SPEAKER_13]: Hopefully you haven't had to deal with that yet, though.

2507
02:51:27,057 --> 02:51:27,898
[SPEAKER_13]: Was it made in Taiwan?

2508
02:51:33,431 --> 02:51:35,171
[SPEAKER_10]: Here comes Iguana Girl on the keyboard.

2509
02:51:36,972 --> 02:51:39,092
[SPEAKER_10]: I think she's going to post a link to the Iron Bra.

2510
02:51:39,552 --> 02:51:41,473
[SPEAKER_10]: If you haven't seen this, Sherlock, you've got to check it out.

2511
02:51:41,593 --> 02:51:42,013
[SPEAKER_10]: It's amazing.

2512
02:51:42,433 --> 02:51:42,993
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, God.

2513
02:51:43,753 --> 02:51:44,914
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if I want to see this.

2514
02:51:46,094 --> 02:51:46,694
[SPEAKER_10]: It's pretty funny.

2515
02:51:46,934 --> 02:51:51,976
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, I think we've got in all the votes for Cage Match, so if you don't mind, Sherlock, I'm going to sidetrack for a little bit here.

2516
02:51:52,296 --> 02:51:54,296
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to announce the winner of tonight's Cage Match.

2517
02:51:54,336 --> 02:51:54,897
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys ready?

2518
02:51:56,397 --> 02:51:59,678
[SPEAKER_10]: First of all, what do you guys think won out of all those songs?

2519
02:52:01,394 --> 02:52:04,176
[SPEAKER_06]: You're fucking ruining America, goddamn you people.

2520
02:52:04,597 --> 02:52:05,838
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's see.

2521
02:52:05,858 --> 02:52:06,318
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go.

2522
02:52:06,839 --> 02:52:12,403
[SPEAKER_10]: Tonight's winner is... Vlad!

2523
02:52:13,004 --> 02:52:14,365
[SPEAKER_10]: With electronic supersonic.

2524
02:52:14,405 --> 02:52:15,106
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, Sherlock.

2525
02:52:16,267 --> 02:52:17,528
[SPEAKER_10]: The tribe has spoken.

2526
02:52:18,248 --> 02:52:24,574
[SPEAKER_10]: With almost, get this, get this, Sherlock, twice as many votes as songs one and two combined.

2527
02:52:27,176 --> 02:52:28,977
[SPEAKER_13]: You people smoke crack, I swear.

2528
02:52:29,138 --> 02:52:29,418
[SPEAKER_10]: Well...

2529
02:52:32,026 --> 02:52:32,726
[SPEAKER_10]: What can we say?

2530
02:52:32,807 --> 02:52:38,409
[SPEAKER_10]: I already told you we were the bastardous, cancerous sub-community here, and that vote speaks for itself.

2531
02:52:39,010 --> 02:52:41,791
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, yeah, it seems like it.

2532
02:52:44,092 --> 02:52:45,273
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you get a link to the picture there?

2533
02:52:45,813 --> 02:52:46,634
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I did.

2534
02:52:49,415 --> 02:52:50,875
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd rather not look at it again.

2535
02:52:50,915 --> 02:52:51,575
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me look.

2536
02:52:51,595 --> 02:52:53,036
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to see if it actually works or not.

2537
02:52:53,076 --> 02:52:53,716
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me put it.

2538
02:52:53,776 --> 02:52:56,436
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're in our chat room there, over at OrangeLawrenceRadio.com, click on chat.

2539
02:52:56,456 --> 02:52:56,957
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep, there it is.

2540
02:52:57,437 --> 02:53:01,657
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Iguana Girl with the lovely white face in the iron bra.

2541
02:53:02,798 --> 02:53:03,318
[SPEAKER_10]: Amazing.

2542
02:53:05,118 --> 02:53:05,698
[SPEAKER_13]: That's great.

2543
02:53:05,998 --> 02:53:06,378
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2544
02:53:06,779 --> 02:53:11,119
[SPEAKER_10]: Anything else you want to state on your 15 seconds of fame here, Sherlock?

2545
02:53:13,460 --> 02:53:18,521
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd say something, but then Iguana Girl will probably hate me for it, so I'm just going to... Oh, now we definitely want to hear it.

2546
02:53:20,990 --> 02:53:23,371
[SPEAKER_19]: Let me guess, the internet is serious business, guys?

2547
02:53:23,752 --> 02:53:25,853
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, the internet is very serious business.

2548
02:53:26,853 --> 02:53:27,814
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what I tell everyone.

2549
02:53:27,834 --> 02:53:29,315
[SPEAKER_13]: Why does that taste rough, Iguana Girl?

2550
02:53:30,115 --> 02:53:32,937
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, I'm going to do a nice little shot on the camera right for you.

2551
02:53:33,237 --> 02:53:33,797
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, Chris?

2552
02:53:34,658 --> 02:53:36,939
Yeah.

2553
02:53:37,439 --> 02:53:38,560
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, she just banked her bottom.

2554
02:53:39,621 --> 02:53:39,821
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh!

2555
02:53:41,242 --> 02:53:41,662
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

2556
02:53:42,202 --> 02:53:43,163
[SPEAKER_10]: Man.

2557
02:53:43,263 --> 02:53:46,445
[SPEAKER_10]: It's only when Sherlock calls in do we get the bondage coming out on this show.

2558
02:53:46,465 --> 02:53:46,725
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

2559
02:53:47,267 --> 02:53:49,208
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess we'll have to call in more often then, alright?

2560
02:53:49,429 --> 02:53:51,930
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, are you coming to E3 next year, Sherlock?

2561
02:53:52,270 --> 02:53:53,791
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, I'm hoping so, yeah.

2562
02:53:54,152 --> 02:53:54,732
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I'll be there.

2563
02:53:55,052 --> 02:53:57,414
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, Iguana Girl says something about attacking you at E3.

2564
02:53:57,634 --> 02:53:59,335
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, yeah, she's gonna attack me.

2565
02:54:00,196 --> 02:54:01,317
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, and dyeing your hair.

2566
02:54:02,537 --> 02:54:04,639
[SPEAKER_13]: I talk about Mod of the Month when I'm not supposed to.

2567
02:54:05,259 --> 02:54:06,960
[SPEAKER_10]: And then she hates me for it.

2568
02:54:07,081 --> 02:54:09,022
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, you came in second place this month, didn't you?

2569
02:54:09,182 --> 02:54:10,043
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh no, Iguana Girl did.

2570
02:54:10,583 --> 02:54:11,283
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, she did.

2571
02:54:12,424 --> 02:54:15,907
[SPEAKER_10]: So now that Jason's out of the picture, it's on for next month, isn't it?

2572
02:54:17,679 --> 02:54:19,821
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know, PMG came out of nowhere last time.

2573
02:54:20,081 --> 02:54:21,102
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what?

2574
02:54:21,162 --> 02:54:21,942
[SPEAKER_13]: It's anyone's game.

2575
02:54:22,122 --> 02:54:24,904
[SPEAKER_10]: All I have to say is Orange Lawns Radio, we're plotting something.

2576
02:54:25,325 --> 02:54:28,347
[SPEAKER_10]: We're getting involved this next time, so you guys look out.

2577
02:54:28,487 --> 02:54:29,028
[SPEAKER_10]: You look out.

2578
02:54:29,833 --> 02:54:30,533
[SPEAKER_10]: or we'll see what happens.

2579
02:54:30,793 --> 02:54:31,814
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, thanks for calling, Sherlock.

2580
02:54:31,834 --> 02:54:32,434
[SPEAKER_10]: You have a great night.

2581
02:54:32,834 --> 02:54:33,734
[SPEAKER_10]: We gotta finish up the show here.

2582
02:54:33,934 --> 02:54:34,774
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, thanks for calling.

2583
02:54:35,155 --> 02:54:35,355
[SPEAKER_10]: Later.

2584
02:54:36,915 --> 02:54:37,195
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

2585
02:54:37,455 --> 02:54:38,015
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that was fun.

2586
02:54:39,076 --> 02:54:41,656
[SPEAKER_10]: I like hearing from new people once in a while, so that's good.

2587
02:54:42,317 --> 02:54:45,578
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, we've got to, got to, got to, got to get to the FUs of the week.

2588
02:54:45,898 --> 02:54:52,159
[SPEAKER_10]: If you already sent me your FU of the week, I had to close it on accident because of the cage match voting.

2589
02:54:52,559 --> 02:54:55,400
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you want to get those back into me right now.

2590
02:54:56,000 --> 02:54:57,201
[SPEAKER_10]: In the meantime, we're gonna limit it

2591
02:54:58,214 --> 02:54:58,434
[SPEAKER_10]: Anger.

2592
02:54:58,454 --> 02:54:58,594
[SPEAKER_10]: Anger.

2593
02:55:28,112 --> 02:55:35,017
[SPEAKER_24]: A big, massive, humongous FU to the cost of plane tickets into Gulfport, Mississippi and Mobile.

2594
02:55:35,498 --> 02:55:37,239
[SPEAKER_24]: I couldn't find one into Mobile for less than $800.

2595
02:55:37,279 --> 02:55:42,583
[SPEAKER_24]: And I couldn't find one into Gulfport for less than $500 at the time I needed to leave.

2596
02:55:43,024 --> 02:55:46,586
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, I was on Travelocity trying to pick my time.

2597
02:55:46,706 --> 02:55:51,570
[SPEAKER_24]: And I found one into New Orleans, but that means that my family's going to have to drive an extra hour and a half to come get me.

2598
02:55:52,151 --> 02:55:57,875
[SPEAKER_24]: But at least I get to leave New Orleans at 5 in the afternoon, which means that I get to enjoy the French Quarter during the day.

2599
02:56:00,049 --> 02:56:02,031
[SPEAKER_24]: but it's ridiculous.

2600
02:56:02,972 --> 02:56:03,613
[SPEAKER_10]: Ridiculous!

2601
02:56:04,174 --> 02:56:04,855
[SPEAKER_10]: Totally ridiculous.

2602
02:56:05,896 --> 02:56:08,299
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, moving on.

2603
02:56:08,339 --> 02:56:08,660
[SPEAKER_10]: Here we go.

2604
02:56:09,120 --> 02:56:09,381
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki.

2605
02:56:11,997 --> 02:56:18,740
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck you to my car, and mainly Ford, because they make shoddy cars, and my car is falling apart, and I don't know why.

2606
02:56:18,800 --> 02:56:20,841
[SPEAKER_10]: I just bought it, like, what, six months ago?

2607
02:56:21,542 --> 02:56:32,727
[SPEAKER_10]: Used, granted, but it only has, like, only, like, a thirty-some odd, you know, thousand miles on it, and already the brake system, I think, is going out, or the front part is going out, and guess what?

2608
02:56:33,027 --> 02:56:35,788
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, they have a class action lawsuit for that kind of stuff.

2609
02:56:36,068 --> 02:56:36,849
[SPEAKER_10]: Shoddy breaks.

2610
02:56:37,249 --> 02:56:37,849
[SPEAKER_10]: Yay!

2611
02:56:37,929 --> 02:56:38,470
[SPEAKER_10]: Guess what?

2612
02:56:38,670 --> 02:56:44,872
[SPEAKER_10]: But lucky for me, I was smart and bought the extended warranty, so it will only cost me $50 to fix.

2613
02:56:45,193 --> 02:56:46,293
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever the fuck's wrong.

2614
02:56:47,093 --> 02:56:48,474
[SPEAKER_10]: So, ha!

2615
02:56:49,134 --> 02:56:51,395
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's my guess right now.

2616
02:56:51,876 --> 02:56:55,057
[SPEAKER_10]: Whether or not they fucking try to screw me out of that, that's another story.

2617
02:56:55,717 --> 02:56:56,318
[SPEAKER_10]: For next week.

2618
02:57:04,339 --> 02:57:12,425
[SPEAKER_10]: My FU this week goes out to Sprint, PTS, because I went over there today to get a brand new cell phone and found out they have shit for deals right now.

2619
02:57:12,846 --> 02:57:18,510
[SPEAKER_10]: I figured, you know, I'd be able to get a good deal because I'm not under contract with them right now, but all their deals are pretty shitty.

2620
02:57:18,551 --> 02:57:24,776
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, the salesman, excellent salesman, told me to come back later because they'll probably be getting better deals around Christmas time.

2621
02:57:25,276 --> 02:57:30,941
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck you guys, I swear to God, I'm going over to T-Mobile where I can have a cell phone that Catherine Zeta-Jones endorses.

2622
02:57:33,187 --> 02:57:49,135
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to be generic on this one because it kind of encompasses a couple of different sections, but a giant F you to people who can't seem to understand that when you're banned, you're fucking banned!

2623
02:57:50,336 --> 02:57:58,980
[SPEAKER_19]: You're not supposed to come back, and if you do come back, don't whine and bitch and moan about the fact that you've been banned.

2624
02:57:59,690 --> 02:58:00,971
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to give you some advice.

2625
02:58:01,991 --> 02:58:08,594
[SPEAKER_10]: I realize that I don't have to do any banning or anything like that, so I don't want to deal with the same bullshit you do, but this is how I deal with it here on Orange Lounge, okay?

2626
02:58:08,955 --> 02:58:10,155
[SPEAKER_10]: You just got to look them right in the eye.

2627
02:58:11,096 --> 02:58:11,536
FIRED!

2628
02:58:12,336 --> 02:58:12,936
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what you got to do.

2629
02:58:13,677 --> 02:58:21,381
[SPEAKER_10]: But there are those people out there that are banned from the show like years ago, and they still keep... Yes, we have banned some people.

2630
02:58:21,421 --> 02:58:21,801
[SPEAKER_10]: I forgot.

2631
02:58:23,379 --> 02:58:34,263
[SPEAKER_19]: But, yeah, really, really tired of people who think that they're being cute and make threats on certain other websites that they're going to attack certain websites.

2632
02:58:34,924 --> 02:58:38,545
[SPEAKER_19]: And don't think that we're not going to catch wind of that.

2633
02:58:39,225 --> 02:58:40,586
[SPEAKER_19]: Giant F muted those dumb shits.

2634
02:58:41,406 --> 02:58:42,367
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to close watching you.

2635
02:58:42,827 --> 02:58:43,167
[SPEAKER_10]: Be good.

2636
02:58:43,807 --> 02:58:44,147
[SPEAKER_10]: Islander.

2637
02:58:44,167 --> 02:58:45,628
[SPEAKER_10]: I have none.

2638
02:58:46,690 --> 02:58:48,011
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing?

2639
02:58:48,251 --> 02:58:49,352
[SPEAKER_09]: F you to that, Islander!

2640
02:58:50,432 --> 02:58:50,952
[SPEAKER_10]: That's alright.

2641
02:58:52,133 --> 02:58:53,974
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what, Islander's just a nice guy, honestly.

2642
02:58:53,994 --> 02:58:56,796
[SPEAKER_10]: If you have a chance to meet him in real life, he's honestly the nicest guy.

2643
02:58:57,076 --> 02:59:02,839
[SPEAKER_20]: A wonderful contrast to me.

2644
02:59:02,919 --> 02:59:03,379
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

2645
02:59:03,880 --> 02:59:04,240
[SPEAKER_10]: I see.

2646
02:59:04,420 --> 02:59:04,720
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

2647
02:59:04,880 --> 02:59:05,481
[SPEAKER_10]: Makes sense.

2648
02:59:05,561 --> 02:59:05,821
[SPEAKER_10]: Navi!

2649
02:59:06,499 --> 02:59:07,480
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually have an FU.

2650
02:59:08,101 --> 02:59:08,601
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, what is it?

2651
02:59:09,642 --> 02:59:16,849
[SPEAKER_07]: FU to people who stop talking to you for like three months, call you back because they miss you, make plans and then flake out on you, and disappear again!

2652
02:59:18,831 --> 02:59:20,172
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, wonderful world.

2653
02:59:20,453 --> 02:59:24,316
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yes, and then in reference to her band thing, I got banned.

2654
02:59:25,293 --> 02:59:26,154
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how.

2655
02:59:26,574 --> 02:59:31,797
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a link to some sim files or something.

2656
02:59:32,218 --> 02:59:33,619
[SPEAKER_07]: I checked back on it periodically.

2657
02:59:33,939 --> 02:59:34,799
[SPEAKER_07]: It kept showing up.

2658
02:59:35,580 --> 02:59:36,641
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, can't load the page.

2659
02:59:36,861 --> 02:59:39,462
[SPEAKER_07]: Then the other day, it says, You are banned!

2660
02:59:39,503 --> 02:59:39,863
[SPEAKER_07]: From what?

2661
02:59:39,923 --> 02:59:40,263
[SPEAKER_07]: Freak?

2662
02:59:40,343 --> 02:59:40,683
[SPEAKER_07]: Or where?

2663
02:59:40,823 --> 02:59:45,467
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it was some guy who posted his keysounded 2DX BMS files.

2664
02:59:46,007 --> 02:59:47,608
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was in his signature.

2665
02:59:47,928 --> 02:59:49,829
[SPEAKER_07]: I got some of those a long time ago.

2666
02:59:50,290 --> 02:59:51,891
[SPEAKER_07]: And he only has two people on there at once.

2667
02:59:52,031 --> 02:59:52,651
[SPEAKER_07]: I remembered that.

2668
02:59:52,951 --> 02:59:54,152
[SPEAKER_07]: I checked again like the other night.

2669
02:59:54,212 --> 02:59:54,853
[SPEAKER_07]: It says, I'm banned.

2670
02:59:54,913 --> 02:59:55,173
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm all,

2671
02:59:55,953 --> 02:59:56,933
[SPEAKER_07]: That's odd.

2672
02:59:58,214 --> 02:59:59,594
[SPEAKER_16]: F that.

2673
03:00:00,394 --> 03:00:00,834
[SPEAKER_07]: Arcadian!

2674
03:00:02,594 --> 03:00:03,375
[SPEAKER_10]: Lucky to lies.

2675
03:00:04,775 --> 03:00:05,455
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh, ouch.

2676
03:00:05,575 --> 03:00:08,516
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's check out what the chatroom has to say.

2677
03:00:09,576 --> 03:00:10,696
[SPEAKER_10]: Start off with Zaku.

2678
03:00:11,316 --> 03:00:14,377
[SPEAKER_10]: F you, oh boy, here we go, it's political, brace yourselves.

2679
03:00:15,097 --> 03:00:24,879
[SPEAKER_10]: F you to the Jesus-lovin' gun-lovin' red state voters for electing that no-good excuse of a chimp of President George W. Bush to a second term in the words of a great pump-it-up song, Lazenka Save Us.

2680
03:00:26,445 --> 03:00:27,426
[SPEAKER_10]: That was awfully punny.

2681
03:00:28,767 --> 03:00:32,709
[SPEAKER_10]: Raichan, fuck to you to being one of the many that's sick.

2682
03:00:34,430 --> 03:00:37,112
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I think she's saying fuck you to herself for being sick.

2683
03:00:37,152 --> 03:00:37,593
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure.

2684
03:00:38,673 --> 03:00:39,434
[SPEAKER_10]: I missed that somehow.

2685
03:00:40,995 --> 03:00:43,397
[SPEAKER_10]: Jazz says, F you to procrastination.

2686
03:00:43,997 --> 03:00:44,157
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah!

2687
03:00:46,499 --> 03:00:49,581
[SPEAKER_10]: Poto says, F you to laggy towns in MMOs.

2688
03:00:52,763 --> 03:00:56,866
[SPEAKER_10]: MPQ says, F you to the arcade for being close the day I went there.

2689
03:00:59,187 --> 03:01:03,050
[SPEAKER_10]: BlackDevilerX says, F you to those Asian files on the DDR Freak forums.

2690
03:01:03,090 --> 03:01:04,190
[SPEAKER_10]: Those guys piss me off.

2691
03:01:08,280 --> 03:01:10,361
[SPEAKER_10]: Any comment on that?

2692
03:01:10,481 --> 03:01:14,464
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sorry I cannot control the content of the idiot post.

2693
03:01:14,844 --> 03:01:15,244
[SPEAKER_20]: Sorry.

2694
03:01:15,484 --> 03:01:16,965
[SPEAKER_10]: I figured while you're here I would let you say that.

2695
03:01:17,065 --> 03:01:17,846
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh my god.

2696
03:01:19,406 --> 03:01:23,129
[SPEAKER_10]: Elmullet says, F you to Halo 2 and a type the game will never live up to.

2697
03:01:27,011 --> 03:01:28,972
[SPEAKER_10]: Blue using Halo 2, that's all that matters.

2698
03:01:30,475 --> 03:01:36,139
[SPEAKER_10]: And lastly, DDR Angel says, F you to my video card for suddenly not liking Final Fantasy XI again.

2699
03:01:36,199 --> 03:01:37,340
[SPEAKER_10]: I wondered why I hadn't seen her on.

2700
03:01:37,761 --> 03:01:39,482
[SPEAKER_10]: Grr, no Final Fantasy XI for me.

2701
03:01:39,562 --> 03:01:40,563
[SPEAKER_10]: Hmm, birthday present maybe?

2702
03:01:40,883 --> 03:01:41,884
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'll keep wishing.

2703
03:01:42,464 --> 03:01:43,085
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, done, bye.

2704
03:01:44,046 --> 03:01:46,047
[SPEAKER_10]: And Jamie has some advice from the laundry room.

2705
03:01:46,067 --> 03:01:46,928
[SPEAKER_10]: She's yelling back to the laundry room.

2706
03:01:47,248 --> 03:01:47,909
[SPEAKER_10]: Play a real game.

2707
03:01:48,649 --> 03:01:49,570
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, play a real game.

2708
03:01:51,414 --> 03:01:51,754
[SPEAKER_10]: Fired!

2709
03:02:12,157 --> 03:02:14,438
[SPEAKER_07]: V-Rares, and all that stuff to find out how great they actually are.

2710
03:02:14,658 --> 03:02:14,938
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

2711
03:02:14,978 --> 03:02:17,619
[SPEAKER_10]: November's just a busy month, and we'll have to carry over some stuff to next week.

2712
03:02:17,919 --> 03:02:19,780
[SPEAKER_10]: You know you're welcome back here anytime, all you guys are.

2713
03:02:19,800 --> 03:02:21,260
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, as long as I'm willing to drive here.

2714
03:02:21,660 --> 03:02:22,641
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, in a little ways.

2715
03:02:22,881 --> 03:02:23,261
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree.

2716
03:02:23,321 --> 03:02:24,061
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of crazy.

2717
03:02:24,121 --> 03:02:25,962
[SPEAKER_10]: But thank you, of course, for coming, as always.

2718
03:02:26,502 --> 03:02:29,063
[SPEAKER_10]: And thank you guys, Iguana Girl and Islander.

2719
03:02:29,103 --> 03:02:29,763
[SPEAKER_10]: Hope you had a good time.

2720
03:02:29,863 --> 03:02:30,463
[SPEAKER_10]: Come back sometime.

2721
03:02:30,984 --> 03:02:31,764
[SPEAKER_10]: Definitely.

2722
03:02:31,944 --> 03:02:33,905
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, good luck with that radio station.

2723
03:02:34,005 --> 03:02:34,345
[SPEAKER_10]: Grr.

2724
03:02:34,465 --> 03:02:34,845
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm kidding.

2725
03:02:36,378 --> 03:02:39,060
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll be interesting to see what happens in the next couple months or so.

2726
03:02:39,700 --> 03:02:40,221
[SPEAKER_10]: Good luck to you guys.

2727
03:02:40,801 --> 03:02:45,043
[SPEAKER_10]: And good luck with the moderation of those forums, huh?

2728
03:02:45,504 --> 03:02:45,884
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, yeah.

2729
03:02:46,884 --> 03:02:48,605
[SPEAKER_10]: And Arcadian... Damn the man.

2730
03:02:49,066 --> 03:02:49,646
[SPEAKER_19]: Save the empire.

2731
03:02:50,286 --> 03:02:52,968
[SPEAKER_10]: Arcadian, big thanks to you as well for being here, as always.

2732
03:02:53,848 --> 03:02:54,069
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

2733
03:02:55,009 --> 03:02:56,270
[SPEAKER_10]: And try not to get pulled over tonight, please.

2734
03:02:57,671 --> 03:02:58,511
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll try.

2735
03:02:59,551 --> 03:03:01,792
[SPEAKER_10]: He's a bad boy outside of this show.

2736
03:03:01,832 --> 03:03:03,272
[SPEAKER_10]: You would never guess it, but boy oh boy.

2737
03:03:03,652 --> 03:03:03,932
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2738
03:03:04,732 --> 03:03:08,113
[SPEAKER_10]: Now it's the part of the show where we go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

2739
03:03:08,233 --> 03:03:10,734
[SPEAKER_10]: Just like Jerry Springer, we go around and get all the final thoughts.

2740
03:03:11,054 --> 03:03:12,334
[SPEAKER_10]: Navi, your final thought for tonight.

2741
03:03:13,294 --> 03:03:14,334
[SPEAKER_10]: I've run out of walls.

2742
03:03:17,055 --> 03:03:18,835
[SPEAKER_10]: Iguana Girl, your final thought for tonight.

2743
03:03:19,055 --> 03:03:20,416
[SPEAKER_20]: Butt plugs in socket.

2744
03:03:22,756 --> 03:03:24,297
[SPEAKER_10]: Islander, your final thought for tonight.

2745
03:03:24,837 --> 03:03:26,137
[SPEAKER_02]: Eat, drink, and be merry.

2746
03:03:27,264 --> 03:03:27,604
[SPEAKER_10]: Very nice.

2747
03:03:27,664 --> 03:03:29,145
[SPEAKER_10]: Arcadian, your final thought for tonight?

2748
03:03:31,066 --> 03:03:31,766
[SPEAKER_03]: You see, I'm bad.

2749
03:03:31,906 --> 03:03:32,766
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't know the half of it!

2750
03:03:32,866 --> 03:03:33,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Ha ha ha!

2751
03:03:34,087 --> 03:03:34,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Or maybe not.

2752
03:03:36,468 --> 03:03:37,068
[SPEAKER_03]: No, can't have that.

2753
03:03:37,928 --> 03:03:38,849
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, your final thought?

2754
03:03:40,389 --> 03:03:43,030
[SPEAKER_10]: I have the device done, now to haunt the house.

2755
03:03:45,171 --> 03:03:45,812
[SPEAKER_10]: Jamie, quick!

2756
03:03:46,092 --> 03:03:46,672
[SPEAKER_10]: Jamie, quick!

2757
03:03:46,712 --> 03:03:47,372
[SPEAKER_10]: Your final thought?

2758
03:03:47,953 --> 03:03:48,933
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll go, I'll go with mine.

2759
03:03:49,233 --> 03:03:56,276
[SPEAKER_10]: My final thought is, Outside the Box moves to Thursday this week, so please don't forget to listen and fuck... Fuck Survivor and fuck The Apprentice!

2760
03:03:57,515 --> 03:03:58,435
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

2761
03:03:58,455 --> 03:03:59,156
[SPEAKER_16]: I have clean clothes.

2762
03:03:59,176 --> 03:04:00,316
[SPEAKER_10]: They smell like gain.

2763
03:04:12,392 --> 03:04:12,712
[SPEAKER_10]: Lovely.

2764
03:04:13,633 --> 03:04:14,273
[SPEAKER_10]: One last thing.

2765
03:04:14,413 --> 03:04:16,874
[SPEAKER_10]: The final word of the show.

2766
03:04:17,475 --> 03:04:19,036
[SPEAKER_10]: One word that sums it all up.

2767
03:04:19,416 --> 03:04:20,717
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll give it to Iguana Girl tonight.

2768
03:04:20,757 --> 03:04:21,817
[SPEAKER_10]: Tonight's final word.

2769

03:04:23,858 --> 03:04:28,881
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see you next week where we're going to interview Conception and talk all much more about all these Bomani stuff.

2772
03:04:28,961 --> 03:04:29,441
[SPEAKER_10]: Final word.

2773
03:04:30,342 --> 03:04:30,762
[SPEAKER_10]: Boobies.

2774
03:04:32,230 --> 03:04:37,093
[SPEAKER_33]: That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

2775
03:04:37,933 --> 03:04:42,135

2778
03:05:29,039 --> 03:05:29,660
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks for watching!

2779
03:06:02,280 --> 03:06:03,245
Back to him that night

2780
03:06:27,813 --> 03:06:38,025

2785
03:08:20,318 --> 03:08:23,699
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully you guys know to stick around because there's always something fun after the credits.

2786
03:08:24,299 --> 03:08:26,480
[SPEAKER_10]: Tonight, my God, we are so pooped though.

2787
03:08:26,660 --> 03:08:28,060
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's just been a hell of a show.

2788
03:08:28,881 --> 03:08:30,281
[SPEAKER_10]: What a way to come back after not being here.

2789
03:08:32,602 --> 03:08:34,342
[SPEAKER_10]: I do, I need to talk about ratings though.

2790
03:08:34,962 --> 03:08:36,283
[SPEAKER_10]: I need to talk about ratings for the station.

2791
03:08:36,723 --> 03:08:37,223
[SPEAKER_10]: Rating, what?

2792
03:08:39,545 --> 03:08:43,548
[SPEAKER_10]: Ratings for the station have fallen 20% in the past two weeks.

2793
03:08:45,329 --> 03:08:47,371
[SPEAKER_10]: I am quite disappointed in you guys, that's alright.

2794
03:08:47,951 --> 03:08:54,676
[SPEAKER_10]: But here's your chance, go in your little player window right now, vote us a 5 that you love this station, you want to listen to it every day, and then do so.

2795
03:08:55,136 --> 03:08:56,357
[SPEAKER_10]: And help our ratings get back up.

2796
03:08:56,377 --> 03:09:00,280
[SPEAKER_10]: Now we realize, okay, we were off for a week, we had some repeats in there.

2797
03:09:00,900 --> 03:09:04,502
[SPEAKER_10]: and you know, we had some shows, switch days and stuff.

2798
03:09:04,822 --> 03:09:06,002
[SPEAKER_10]: No more excuses, we're done.

2799
03:09:06,022 --> 03:09:11,145
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so you gotta whore us up so that we can be the number one internet radio station of all time.

2800
03:09:11,225 --> 03:09:12,105
[SPEAKER_10]: That is the ultimate goal.

2801
03:09:13,186 --> 03:09:13,426
[SPEAKER_10]: Jamie.

2802
03:09:15,427 --> 03:09:16,067
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, we do love you.

2803
03:09:17,248 --> 03:09:17,708
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

2804
03:09:18,948 --> 03:09:23,950
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm hoping that with the Akira contest, we'll be able to get back up in there and some other things.

2805
03:09:24,050 --> 03:09:25,831
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, you guys know I'm just teasing.

2806
03:09:25,871 --> 03:09:31,113
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I can't expect you guys to listen all the time, but it would make me a happy boy.

2807
03:09:32,894 --> 03:09:38,637
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, I also want to talk quickly about The Incredibles, that movie, because I'm surprised you didn't say much about it, Loki.

2808
03:09:38,837 --> 03:09:39,557
[SPEAKER_10]: What did you think of the movie?

2809
03:09:41,798 --> 03:09:44,659
[SPEAKER_10]: It is what all superhero movies should aspire to.

2810
03:09:45,280 --> 03:09:45,980
[SPEAKER_10]: It is actually...

2811
03:09:47,023 --> 03:09:53,627
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very misleading, like anyone that's seen the previous, because they think, oh, it's a kids movie, oh, this and that.

2812
03:09:53,927 --> 03:10:00,110
[SPEAKER_10]: But actually, it has a story that I would say is on par, if not better, than a lot of the animated Superman and

2813
03:10:00,886 --> 03:10:28,531
[SPEAKER_10]: Batman series and we know that those are awesome writers on those series and of course the guy that wrote the whole damn thing the guy behind the Iron Giant that movie was incredible this movie is literally the set design the character development everything is just excellent you need to see this movie I cannot stress that enough it is awesome, I cannot wait for a sequel

2814
03:10:29,847 --> 03:10:30,928
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

2815
03:10:52,185 --> 03:10:53,966
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you see his movie yet, Navi?

2816
03:10:53,986 --> 03:10:54,126
[SPEAKER_10]: At all?

2817
03:10:54,146 --> 03:10:54,386
[SPEAKER_10]: I have not.

2818
03:10:54,407 --> 03:10:55,447
[SPEAKER_10]: The last movie I saw was The Grudge.

2819
03:10:55,467 --> 03:10:56,188
[SPEAKER_10]: What did you think of that?

2820
03:11:21,334 --> 03:11:29,102
[SPEAKER_07]: I liked it a lot, and a lot of people that have seen it either said they liked it and thought it was really scary and then other people said that movie had absolutely no substance whatsoever, it was crap.

2821
03:11:29,952 --> 03:11:34,855
[SPEAKER_07]: I liked it, I thought it, I mean, it was more something like, wow, it was actually a scary movie.

2822
03:11:34,935 --> 03:11:39,458
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't see very many scary movies very often anymore, at least that's what I thought.

2823
03:11:39,618 --> 03:11:45,222
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, for the record, I did not get to see the Star Wars 3 trailer when I saw The Incredibles, just for whoever asked.

2824
03:11:45,702 --> 03:11:52,187
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't really care, I'm not like the hugest Star Wars fan in the world, I mean, you know, hooray, the movie's coming out, but, you know, I'll be okay.

2825
03:11:52,947 --> 03:11:56,409
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, I like the grudge as well, except for the audience I saw it with.

2826
03:11:56,449 --> 03:11:57,489
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you should have been the mom.

2827
03:11:57,509 --> 03:12:00,011
[SPEAKER_10]: You should, like, compare audiences later.

2828
03:12:00,671 --> 03:12:01,231
[SPEAKER_10]: Seriously.

2829
03:12:02,092 --> 03:12:02,412
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2830
03:12:03,032 --> 03:12:04,893
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, okay, that's going to do it for the afterbirth, you guys.

2831
03:12:04,913 --> 03:12:05,713
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got to take off.

2832
03:12:05,773 --> 03:12:09,815
[SPEAKER_10]: Jamie's got to get home, and I got tests to grade and stuff like that.

2833
03:12:09,856 --> 03:12:12,037
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you guys for listening, though, so much.

2834
03:12:12,157 --> 03:12:14,538
[SPEAKER_10]: We really do appreciate the fact that you guys support this station.

2835
03:12:15,058 --> 03:12:19,222
[SPEAKER_10]: Through our high points and our low points, we are working on so many exciting things for you guys.

2836
03:12:19,502 --> 03:12:21,024
[SPEAKER_10]: We're teaming up with Spot.

2837
03:12:21,284 --> 03:12:22,886
[SPEAKER_10]: We're teaming up with Freak.

2838
03:12:23,146 --> 03:12:25,148
[SPEAKER_10]: It's amazing, the stuff that's in the future for us.

2839
03:12:26,189 --> 03:12:33,596
[SPEAKER_10]: I really thank you guys who have supported us, especially those from day one, but we definitely welcome all you guys that hop on board as the show goes on.

2840
03:12:33,616 --> 03:12:34,196
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just amazing.

2841
03:12:34,216 --> 03:12:34,477
[SPEAKER_10]: It's amazing.

2842
03:12:34,497 --> 03:12:34,897
[SPEAKER_10]: It's amazing.

2843
03:12:37,738 --> 03:12:38,538
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think it's on, Jamie.

2844
03:12:38,738 --> 03:12:39,959
[SPEAKER_24]: Remember, do it for the ferrets.

2845
03:12:40,059 --> 03:12:40,239
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

2846
03:12:40,339 --> 03:12:41,019
[SPEAKER_10]: They love you too.

2847
03:12:41,799 --> 03:12:42,960
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's hear a little ferret love there.

2848
03:12:43,800 --> 03:12:44,660
[SPEAKER_10]: Get a little ferret love.

2849
03:12:46,101 --> 03:12:46,941
[SPEAKER_10]: Even, you know what?

2850
03:12:47,681 --> 03:12:49,021
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, we don't get enough.

2851
03:12:50,522 --> 03:12:52,562
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't get enough love out of Loki on this show.

2852
03:12:52,702 --> 03:12:55,203
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, will you please let the listeners know how much you love them?

2853
03:12:57,984 --> 03:12:58,284
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, no.

2854
03:13:01,642 --> 03:13:03,883
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, enjoy the post show tonight.

2855
03:13:03,963 --> 03:13:05,184
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys can probably figure this one out.

2856
03:13:05,224 --> 03:13:08,085
[SPEAKER_10]: We definitely have to load you down with some 2DX Red music.

2857
03:13:08,666 --> 03:13:14,888
[SPEAKER_10]: So enjoy, have a great night, and we'll see you tomorrow night for Diversion at 7 o'clock for Monty Remixes.

2858
03:13:14,928 --> 03:13:15,669
[SPEAKER_10]: Have a great night, guys!

2859
03:15:12,918 --> 03:15:16,125
When I got the older baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

2860
03:16:07,979 --> 03:16:08,542
Thanks for watching!

2861
03:17:04,200 --> 03:17:05,127
Thanks for watching!

2862
03:19:00,260 --> 03:19:01,021
Thanks for watching!

2863
03:19:49,540 --> 03:19:51,050
Thanks for watching!

2864
03:24:48,476 --> 03:24:49,523
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks for watching!

2865
03:28:51,425 --> 03:28:51,728
Thank you.

2866
03:29:36,298 --> 03:29:38,282
Thank you for watching!

2867
03:31:47,032 --> 03:31:47,914
Thanks for watching!

2868
03:32:48,257 --> 03:32:49,998
[SPEAKER_10]: You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2869
03:32:50,018 --> 03:32:55,319
[SPEAKER_10]: We're live here with this post show going on of 2DX11 style, also known as 2DX Red Music.

2870
03:32:55,399 --> 03:32:58,760
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess it's taboo to call it 2DX11 style.

2871
03:32:58,780 --> 03:32:59,681
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not supposed to say that.

2872
03:32:59,701 --> 03:33:03,402
[SPEAKER_10]: I might get bitch slapped by some rabid fan.

2873
03:33:03,662 --> 03:33:09,084
[SPEAKER_10]: But actually what I'm going to do right now is I'm actually going to do something technical on this end that has to do with the archive of the broadcast.

2874
03:33:10,164 --> 03:33:13,607
[SPEAKER_10]: The past few weeks we've been having trouble with it, though, and it stopped the station.

2875
03:33:13,687 --> 03:33:17,989
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you guys get booted from the stream, it's going to go back to the Bomani Music and More program.

2876
03:33:18,009 --> 03:33:24,373
[SPEAKER_10]: So just restart the stream in like 15 seconds if we disconnect, okay?

2877
03:33:24,614 --> 03:33:25,194
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to try it now.

2878
03:33:25,214 --> 03:33:27,736
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to hope we don't, though, so I can keep going with the 2DX Red stuff.

2879
03:33:27,756 --> 03:33:28,176
[SPEAKER_10]: Here we go.

2880
03:33:28,256 --> 03:33:29,257
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see what happens.

2881
03:33:29,797 --> 03:33:31,158
[SPEAKER_10]: If I lose you guys, then good night.

2882
03:33:31,378 --> 03:33:31,558
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.
