788596	797963	And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.
798702	802806	Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bomani Music and More program.
802826	803787	Can we talk about that?
804067	806429	No subject will ever be taboo.
806690	810333	Well, I was thinking maybe we should move Pump Up the Volume from Tuesday Nights.
810853	813396	Except, of course, a subject that was just under discussion.
813916	819261	Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?
819822	821103	I collect your fucking head.
823055	824555	Just like this fucker here.
825636	829317	Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki?
829617	832978	The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!
833918	840500	Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!
840520	845422	Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.
849437	853940	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode 117 on this 11-7.
854020	858522	I'm sure glad I took that lozenge, you know, took care of my voice problem.
858682	860583	What's going on with everybody being sick lately?
861043	862824	Quick poll in the room, because we have a lot of people here.
863045	865846	Who has been sick in the past week, or feeling it a little bit?
866386	870569	One, two, three, I thought, didn't you just say you were sick, Navi?
870849	871269	As of today.
871289	872170	As of this afternoon.
872210	872450	Four.
872690	873010	About half.
873090	873691	I'm a sick club.
874727	879332	Half the folks in here are in the sick club right now, so I'm a little worried.
879372	882435	I hope we don't catch it, but I think everybody's past contagious stage.
882935	885638	If I exhale hard enough, I can make the raspy voice.
886639	886980	Hot.
887180	889662	I've got the rockin' pneumonia and the boogie-woogie flu.
889682	890283	Does that count?
891604	892625	The boogie-woogie flu?
892746	893346	It's a song.
894307	894808	You ever heard?
895685	897488	I cannot believe you've never heard that song.
898068	901492	Maybe I have heard it and I just forgot it because it sucked.
901873	902794	It doesn't suck.
902834	903315	Just kidding.
903875	906378	Anyway, if you're just joining us, welcome to the show.
906398	908841	We do have a whole lot of special guests here in the studio tonight.
909262	912766	Flo walks here, Sharks Girl, Islander, Iguana Girl, Navi.
913166	916950	Arcadian 42, and then of course myself, DarkSakura, and Loki, all here.
917210	918051	This is a crowded house.
918691	925537	A good way to come back from episode, or I should say a non-episode, not having a show for a week, so it's a good way to come back.
926078	933164	But we're going to start off tonight's show as we start off every week, this week being no different, and I want to know, how was your week and how was your day?
933565	936327	And also tonight, a bonus question, how was your Halloween?
937168	938329	Jamie, start us off as you always do.
939671	950221	My Halloween, well we did the thing at work and I was wearing these fuzzy leg warmers and fuzzy arm warmers and had cat ears and a tail and went around playing with yarn and blah, that was it.
950622	958069	We had Rocky though on Saturday night, well technically Sunday morning, Saturday night, and I got to play with lights.
959090	959871	Wow, it's
962071	966676	No, I just, I didn't, I don't think I had enough time to get used to it, but it was cool.
967817	972041	And then Halloween, I was just sort of like, dress up, what's that?
973283	975145	And the rest of the week was all busy, busy, busy.
975685	978668	And had fun yesterday, hanging out.
979609	980070	Lots of fun.
981440	983220	So, that was it.
983300	984941	I kept this one short because we have a lot of people.
985021	985581	I know, wow.
986301	986761	I'm shocked.
986921	988561	Usually you have like a 15 minute monologue.
988961	989462	It's amazing.
989602	989962	I'm just kidding.
991022	992582	Alright, FloWalk, how you doing?
992602	992982	How was your week?
993002	993382	How was your day?
993402	993962	How was your Halloween?
994383	1000504	Let's see, Halloween, gosh, I really can't remember much of it because there just really wasn't a bunch of Halloween type stuff going on.
1000544	1004424	I didn't get a chance to break out my Lucas from the Wizard costume.
1005225	1006525	Aww, I bet it was so bad.
1006545	1007045	Yeah.
1008172	1008932	Indeed it was.
1009313	1014255	But, uh, let's see, as far as the week goes, gosh, man, I think... I just have to interject, though.
1015055	1020497	You went to Classic Gaming Expo, of course, you were there, and I think most, well, a few people in this room went to Classic Gaming Expo.
1021238	1027220	I don't know how many of you guys saw the power glove that was in the room, where they were showing all the old stuff.
1027640	1031562	Every time, people would walk by it, like, every other person would go, it's so bad.
1032022	1032823	Myself included.
1033923	1034764	Myself included.
1035804	1036685	Anyway, sorry to interrupt.
1037345	1038426	It was cool.
1038446	1044029	Let's see, as far as the week goes, gosh, I think I probably speak like just everyone else.
1044109	1047431	Probably been sucked up in way too many video games to count.
1047931	1050953	I mean, Katamari's just been giving me eye strain like a mother.
1051373	1057917	Although, for those who have played, I don't know if anyone else has gone a perfect 10 meters on the North Star, but... Alright, nice!
1061564	1068247	Cool, yeah, it took me like about seven tries or so, but once I figured out the pattern, it's like, yeah, cake, and then all that good stuff.
1068687	1085513	And then, let's see, I actually am not working at Konami for the time being, but I did get hired over at the Princeton Review over just this week, so if anyone needs some hookups on SAT cheat sheets, hey, then again, I didn't need that because I got 1440 on mine, so, hey.
1085533	1085633	Cool.
1088993	1097980	And then today is just, of course, you know, always making the track up from the South Bay up here and jamming to Sirius Radio, which is like the greatest invention next to the iPod.
1098981	1102084	And here we are now, and it only gets better from here.
1102624	1104526	Is Sirius the one that's getting Howard Stern?
1105046	1105487	Yes, it is.
1106427	1109530	I was checking out because I need to get my car stereo replaced, and I was kind of thinking about it.
1109670	1110110	Think about it.
1110751	1111091	We'll see.
1111111	1112853	Sirius went from 600,000 customers to over...
1114983	1117365	just under a million in less than a month on that one announcement alone.
1117625	1117925	Figures.
1118245	1119186	And I'm one of them.
1119406	1119947	No surprises.
1121648	1128533	It would be my dream one day to get this shit on satellite radio, but yeah, I'm not holding my breath on that one.
1130029	1131849	But I did see one of those things at Best Buy.
1131889	1135210	It's like a stereo where you can listen to internet radio like anywhere in your house.
1135470	1136250	It looked pretty cool.
1136530	1136950	It was $180.
1136990	1137750	But it looked pretty cool.
1138350	1140431	And hopefully, you know, in about a year, technology comes down.
1140931	1141951	So, anyway.
1143211	1143591	Yeah, hi.
1144011	1145312	Shark Skrill, how was your week?
1145352	1145832	How was your day?
1145852	1147332	How was your Halloween?
1148052	1150092	I don't even remember what I did for Halloween, really.
1150793	1151913	Is this thing working or no?
1152053	1152433	It's working.
1152473	1154353	I'm going to go back and make sure the audio levels are up.
1154393	1154793	Okay, cool.
1155213	1157934	But, yeah, I just kind of hung out for Halloween.
1157954	1158414	It was boring.
1160203	1161083	You went shopping today, right?
1184122	1185363	I bought shoes.
1185983	1186764	I was a good girl.
1186804	1187904	I only came back with one pair.
1188525	1191947	Are you one of those girls that has like 100 pairs of shoes in their closet?
1191967	1191947	20.
1192647	1196510	Well, that's probably average for a lot of girls I know.
1196590	1199492	And the scary thing is I haven't bought any shoes in like two years.
1199532	1203034	And then in like the past probably nine months, I've bought like 10 pair.
1203694	1204675	I get them like all the time.
1204695	1206196	People are threatening to call me Imelda.
1208174	1209395	Okay, I'm not even going to joke with you.
1209895	1216158	One of my best friends in high school, who I used to do my public access show with back in the day, she had 100 pairs of shoes in her closet.
1216238	1216738	Good God.
1216798	1219780	Like, there's not enough days in the year to wear all those.
1219820	1223121	Have you worn every one of those pairs each one day at least?
1223282	1224102	She's like, I think so.
1224522	1228944	Hey, I went through my shoe stash the other day, and I was like, I don't even remember buying these things.
1229004	1229645	What the hell?
1229725	1230345	These are cute.
1231786	1232306	Now I'm wearing them.
1233847	1234207	Very cool.
1234487	1234827	All right.
1235227	1236248	Well, let's talk to Islander.
1237349	1238510	Hello, how was your week?
1238550	1239050	How was your day?
1239130	1240671	How was your Halloween?
1241032	1242313	Week's going by just fine.
1242853	1248537	The only one who's, like, not sick, thanks to this, like, freakishly good immune system.
1249878	1253320	Yeah, like, no, seriously, like, Jessica, like, just kind of shakes her head.
1253340	1259244	Yeah, as you can see on camera, she's giving me the finger, because I hardly ever get sick, and I don't know why.
1260165	1260986	It's the RTF genes.
1261166	1261506	Thank you.
1262206	1263167	Yeah, it definitely is.
1263247	1264168	It must be the RTF genes.
1266089	1267090	But, uh, no, um...
1268049	1271410	Halloween was basically my day to recover from Rocky.
1273871	1277112	And what was really funny was that after dinner, we went and got some food.
1277572	1279713	Well, not some food, but some candy for the kids.
1280193	1283014	And no kids showed up at all.
1284534	1285635	Which was kind of surprising.
1286515	1286755	None.
1286995	1287235	Yeah.
1287816	1288876	No kids at all.
1291017	1291657	Seriously.
1291937	1292717	I don't know what's going on.
1293497	1295238	But other than that, I've been trying...
1295984	1301685	I've been trying to get ready for... I wanted to go to the Madden Challenge for Madden 2005, but that's not happening because I suck.
1303265	1305246	And I've just lately been playing a lot of SmackDown.
1306166	1307026	That's pretty much it, though.
1308226	1312127	Did I tell you one day I saw the Madden 2005 bus broke down on the side of the road?
1312327	1313067	Are you serious?
1313207	1314027	Pretty fucking funny.
1314047	1323709	Yeah, on the 680... On the 680, I was driving down... I think it was one time I was coming to see you one day, SharkScrawlers, driving down 680, and there was the bus broke down on the side of the road.
1323729	1325109	I was like, that is hilarious!
1325970	1329291	I talked about that like weeks ago on Outside Talks, but yeah, it's crazy.
1329791	1329991	Funny.
1330631	1331771	Anyway, let's move on.
1331971	1333652	And Iguana Girl, welcome back.
1334352	1334612	Thank you.
1334632	1335252	It's been a little while.
1335472	1336353	Yeah.
1336553	1338873	It's been quite a while since you and I have been on a show together.
1338893	1339373	Wow.
1339593	1341214	It's kind of like a reunion.
1341434	1342714	Oh my god, oh my god.
1342734	1343774	2001 all over again.
1345355	1346855	I'm glad we can be candid about it, though.
1347255	1347555	Seriously.
1347635	1348015	It's good.
1348155	1350036	I mean, for those that don't know, Iguana Girl and I...
1351584	1353626	Weren't the best of friends the last couple years.
1354867	1356329	To put it lightly, yes.
1356349	1359812	Which, you know, but, you know, time heals things.
1359952	1363836	And we've got a bunch of big balls and we sucked them up.
1364377	1366139	Yeah, you know, we just, you know, kissed and made up.
1366199	1366879	Well, without the kissing.
1368732	1382443	And, you know, but it's worked out good, and, you know, everybody always thought there was this big, like, oh, Orange Lounge versus DDR Freak, because you are the goddess behind DDR Freak Radio, and everybody's always been like, oh, you know, it's, oh, Orange Lounge versus DDR Freak, and not really.
1382463	1386386	We know, I've been sitting here going, uh, don't I do both?
1386446	1386846	Yeah.
1387807	1391890	But no, it's good to have you on, and certainly, if you want to make a plug for DDR Freak Radio, go ahead.
1392171	1393312	Listen to DDR Freak Radio.
1393652	1396094	Because, I think there's...
1398226	1403550	I think there's like... I think there's 90,000 some odd stations on Life 365.
1405663	1406284	I haven't checked.
1406344	1414429	There are many more stations that we could pick on besides DDR Freak Radio.
1414589	1423294	For those who don't know, Guanagirl and I used to do a show way back in the day under Sedation Live, which is still on the air.
1423454	1426816	It just doesn't have us on it anymore, but it's got the very lovely... Kind of moved to Texas.
1426996	1428617	Yeah, the show went and moved to Texas.
1428877	1432598	But it does have the very lovely Jenna, I can't remember her name.
1432618	1434779	Jenna Saunders and Travis Donovan.
1434799	1434999	Yes.
1435559	1438619	So they still are on the air, so check them out, understationalive.org.
1438639	1441800	And sometimes you can even hear the old episodes have a Gwana Girl and I on them.
1442080	1442520	Yep.
1443201	1444481	So we're reunited on the air.
1444501	1445821	In our other names, mind you.
1447562	1448282	The real deal names.
1448362	1448642	Yeah.
1448842	1450322	Anyway, okay, so enough of that.
1450362	1450783	How was your week?
1450803	1451203	How was your day?
1451563	1452003	How was your Halloween?
1452603	1460265	My Halloween was, as most other people in this room, or a good portion of other people in this room, would be spent at Rocky Horror.
1461445	1472107	I played Columbia and got to get all dressed up in all the sequins and do my hair and all that fun jazz and bounce around and hope that my top didn't fall off.
1472788	1477769	And then after that, Halloween, I got Cheat Night.
1478049	1478829	I actually got to have...
1480086	1481728	Yay, cheat night!
1482129	1487316	Got to go to Old Spaghetti Factory and eat those nasty carbs and all that fun schnazz.
1488958	1492042	This week, unfortunately, has been spent being sick.
1493884	1494125	Sick...
1495126	1495926	Work, school.
1496266	1497007	Sick work, school.
1497167	1498607	That's like my mantra this week.
1498687	1501268	So I ended up having to take a couple days off of work, which sucked.
1502608	1505329	And today has been pretty neato mosquito.
1505369	1509190	Yesterday was pretty neato mosquito because I got to spend a lot of time with Miss DarkSakura.
1509870	1512891	And today has been all spiffy because I get to spend it with everybody else.
1513251	1517092	So I'm in a relatively good mood and hopefully I won't be like coughing too hard.
1517112	1518532	All right.
1519178	1519598	How was your week?
1519638	1520079	How was your day?
1520099	1520679	How was your Halloween?
1540657	1549475	Um, Halloween, I was at work, I did nothing, there was no reason to dress up, I work in a deli, I have a costume that smelt like bleach and meat when I come home.
1551797	1555718	My week, well actually the past couple weeks have just been way too busy for me.
1555838	1561459	I don't know, shit's been falling apart at work and I've been working like 46, 48 hours a week.
1562039	1566480	I'm actually kind of looking forward to being sick right now, hoping it lands on a day that I don't have off.
1566880	1572901	You know what, overtime pay rocks though when you've got, and I know you being the import bar, you've got what, eights coming out?
1573701	1579162	There's crap coming out, but on my paychecks right now, they're almost double what I normally get, but...
1581024	1585685	All I've been really buying are all my little collectible stuff, but I don't have any more room.
1586345	1589826	I don't even have room for the stuff that's coming in the mail this week.
1589946	1594607	I actually have over $100 left out of my paycheck this week, so I don't know what's going on with that.
1594687	1596127	So I'm just going to take some time off.
1596728	1601369	You've got to tell that cold to hold off about a week so you can get sick on 15 November.
1601409	1602249	No, three days after.
1602289	1603169	Or maybe 20 November, around that time.
1607330	1613975	Assuming my package gets in the States by... No, it can't, because the 18th is Friday.
1614415	1619279	Remembering back to how things process when they ship from Japan, actually it's going to kind of suck, because I'll have to wait more days.
1619359	1626704	You have the science down to a T. My shit will ship on any given damn day.
1626804	1632629	As long as the package gets into the States by Friday, it will ship on a weekend or a holiday.
1633209	1636592	If not, it flies around in circles over Hawaii or something for the weekend.
1636612	1640014	And then it gets on San Francisco on Monday, and then it gets processed and whatever.
1640415	1642016	But yeah, okay, so that was my week.
1642436	1645178	And then today, today was alright.
1645419	1646900	I slept in forever.
1647820	1649662	Tried playing some 2DX again today.
1650703	1656427	And I was having timing problems when going back to old styles.
1656487	1657248	Got pissed off.
1657628	1661631	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1681212	1683353	Hey, I'm proud of myself.
1683413	1684373	Those are good scores.
1684413	1687033	I'm just jealous because I haven't touched my 2DX controller.
1687073	1689954	Don't worry, I'm not going to be bragging on here or anything.
1690034	1691234	That was what I did today.
1692215	1694115	I sucked at everything else today.
1695195	1695635	So yeah, I'm 10.
1695736	1698156	I have to ask something.
1698336	1699897	I actually played 7th style last week.
1700457	1700717	Did you?
1700797	1701257	Yay!
1701537	1703377	So I did do something with the money related.
1703997	1704538	Well, there you go.
1704578	1705978	And my copy of Papa 9 arrived.
1706653	1707033	Oh, right on.
1707454	1708834	I haven't played it yet, but I have it.
1710315	1710836	Oh, you know what?
1710876	1713677	You don't have enough time to unlock everything before 10 comes out.
1714017	1715598	That gambler's a bitch.
1716339	1717780	I don't even know that I'm going to get 10.
1720361	1723343	It'll take a very, very, very, very long time.
1723383	1724224	That's quite alright.
1724264	1726065	I don't have a lot of time to play.
1727065	1729147	Maybe if we find what, you know...
1730168	1733830	Where you have to be in the game to let it sit in its place so the timer will run and count.
1734211	1736652	Find that and let it sit on for, like, you know, a day.
1737413	1738974	I like to play the little RPG mode.
1739094	1741235	You open the chest, you have X song unlocked.
1741255	1741556	Yeah.
1742036	1742656	That's kind of cool.
1742917	1746499	But seriously, it probably took, like, it took... I don't know, whatever, never mind.
1746599	1746839	Okay.
1748520	1749881	Alright, well then we'll move on.
1750542	1751763	Let's go on to Arcadian42.
1751783	1753324	How was your week?
1753364	1753764	How was your day?
1753804	1755085	How was your Halloween?
1755105	1756966	For Halloween, I didn't do jack shit.
1758207	1758287	Uh...
1759366	1763509	I think I watched Dark City the night before, but didn't do anything on Halloween.
1763810	1771376	Next morning I got some candy, but unlike last year, they didn't do the big sale, because it was like Monday instead of like a weekend.
1772056	1776440	Either that or Safeway learned their lesson about people coming in the next day and buying things for like 50 cents.
1776460	1788390	Instead they just did it for half price, so I bought some stuff and shared it with work, and then worked all week and didn't do much this weekend other than straighten up a little bit and then catch up on message boards and
1789673	1803830	Then today went to store and then went to the arcade for a little bit and played one game of Drum Mania and the cymbal was broken and one game of Guitar Freaks and that was working alright.
1805372	1805712	That's all.
1806313	1808696	It's good to know there's still some people in town that actually play Bomani.
1808976	1809417	It's good to know.
1810705	1819620	Also, I wanted to say, because you mentioned the day before Halloween, I just wanted to say a happy late birthday to Navi and Mel B, who both have the same birthday, if you can believe that.
1820061	1820822	Day before Halloween.
1821764	1822405	Very nice.
1825802	1826862	I'm trying to figure out who's older.
1827283	1827563	All right.
1828383	1830524	I guess I'll talk about my weekend, my day, and my Halloween.
1830544	1833705	Actually, my Halloween was kind of stupid because I was having relationship issues.
1833945	1835945	So I didn't really have much of a Halloween.
1836606	1837986	I had a talking to on Halloween.
1838546	1839867	There were no treats on Halloween.
1840407	1841907	And really not even a trick either.
1842788	1843728	But you had good food.
1844008	1844308	What?
1844368	1845208	But there was good food.
1845649	1846509	Yes, there was good food.
1847009	1852231	And because we had gone to Spaghetti Factory, I went and celebrated Cheat Day, even though every day is Cheat Day for me.
1854344	1855785	We got to make fun of the guys in Walgreens.
1856385	1856925	Yeah, that was cool.
1856945	1859406	We made fun of the guys in Walgreens who were like, I don't know what they were doing.
1859426	1860366	They were hitting on you or something?
1860386	1860966	Maybe they were drunk.
1861327	1861787	They were drunk.
1861827	1862427	They were very drunk.
1862987	1870110	But so, as you may have picked up, a lot of folks in the room here, when we're not doing DDR, we're doing Rocky Horror, so I was involved with all that too.
1870930	1871851	Quite involved with all that.
1873111	1874071	I hope you don't see the pictures.
1874592	1878053	A lot of girls making threats over there.
1878953	1880274	Hey, I got pictures of you too.
1880594	1881034	Don't push me.
1884927	1885288	All right.
1886830	1888472	So that was Halloween the day before.
1888732	1891316	And this last week was pretty boring.
1891356	1895581	I got back into playing Final Fantasy XI, which, you know, addict, right?
1895721	1896643	I play that quite a bit.
1897303	1898505	Oh, yeah, that was my cue.
1898845	1899186	Addict.
1899446	1899807	That's right.
1901328	1904250	And, gosh, not a whole lot else going on, really.
1904950	1907392	I was watching Loki play Grand Theft Auto most of the week.
1907412	1909933	I saw The Incredibles last night, which was a cute movie.
1910313	1911294	It was pretty good.
1911314	1912735	A lot of people are saying it's going to be Oscar.
1913936	1914176	Maybe.
1914336	1914616	I don't know.
1915096	1915957	I like Kill Bill Vol.
1916097	1918178	2 a little better, but, you know, I just like violence.
1919679	1921120	So that was pretty much my week.
1921700	1929505	I decided on Saturday, this will be yesterday, that I want to be just like Tanya, and I'm going to start the DDR diet.
1930365	1933812	So I have to modify my diet a little bit because part of my diet is that I want abs.
1934393	1938020	So I'm now doing the DDRS diet, which is DDR and sit-ups.
1939571	1940532	So we'll see how that works out.
1940552	1941772	I'll keep you posted on my progress.
1941792	1945674	But I found that I'm actually playing Max 2 a lot for DDR.
1946134	1947495	Because nobody's on Ultramix.
1947915	1950877	Like a couple months ago I was playing Ultramix and there would be some nice people on.
1951117	1957801	But I've been kind of pissed off lately because whenever I sign on to Ultramix, all the games on there are like 8 and 9 footer songs, which is cool and all.
1957901	1962143	And I can play those once in a while, but I don't like playing them back to back to back for a half hour.
1963243	1965905	And it really stinks when you're playing against people on a controller.
1967389	1973514	So, I'll have to wait for Ultramix 2 to come out so that Xbox Live kind of gets a swift kick in the ass and, you know, that gets jump-started again.
1973534	1974295	I'll have people playing it.
1974635	1980740	But for the meantime, it's all about the mega dance hits non-stop in Max 2, which has, you know, my Kylie and Ghost and all that stuff.
1980760	1981780	So, it's been a lot of fun.
1982921	1984222	And then, of course, sit-ups.
1985023	1988706	I threw my back out yesterday doing it though because a hard lesson learned.
1989246	1991507	Always stretch before you exercise.
1991808	1993289	Always stretch.
1993749	1994830	How could I be so stupid?
1995010	1995310	I don't know.
1996231	1996511	Alright.
1996951	1998452	I guess we should hear from Loki as well.
1999433	2000053	How was your week?
2000113	2000713	How was your day?
2000794	2001474	How was your Halloween?
2002975	2003856	My week was alright.
2003896	2004676	Didn't do much.
2005857	2006938	What did I do this week?
2008238	2008879	I don't remember.
2009673	2014034	I think it's something between Final Fantasy XI and Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.
2015354	2017535	And, um, let's see what else I'll say.
2017895	2022116	Oh, we went on our first quote-unquote ghost hunt yesterday.
2022216	2028257	We went to Coloma for what seemed like hours, but actually it was only about an hour.
2029038	2034359	And, um... It was stupid, actually, because...
2035640	2044195	I don't know, it was just walking around a stupid cemetery and taking pictures of gravestones and that was just like, eh, whatever, but it kind of...
2045163	2048204	We kind of got a dry run for the whole ghost hunting thing.
2048584	2054405	But anyways, related to that, I finished the so-called Gate to Hell device thing.
2056585	2060906	I was hoping to bring it along with me yesterday, but we didn't have a recorder anyway, so that would have not worked.
2061046	2062187	So, how the fuck is that?
2062767	2064747	But it's done, so that's one project out of the way.
2065247	2068428	And other than that, I also saw The Incredibles, and it was awesome.
2069428	2071588	And... What else did I do?
2071608	2072649	I don't know.
2072969	2073649	Oh, Halloween...
2075478	2084184	Since I was kind of forced to dress up, or I should say persuaded to dress up by my girlfriend, I ended up dressing up like Loki that day.
2084665	2091890	I ironically left from Dogma, so I had a nice coat and wings, and that was kind of fun.
2092590	2098775	And, I don't know, we just had a party and watched the new Dawn of the Dead and then Shaun of the Dead.
2099155	2099996	So that was awesome.
2102257	2102918	And that's all I did.
2106027	2109469	Loki, have you seen that preview for the brand new Mask sequel?
2109729	2111210	You remember the Mask with Jim Carrey?
2112450	2114411	Oh my god, it looks so lame.
2114471	2118893	But Alan Cumming, who is my god, he's so awesome, he plays Loki.
2120494	2121595	Ha ha ha, Cumming.
2123996	2124336	Oh boy.
2126437	2126777	All right.
2127758	2128358	I guess we'll do now.
2128378	2132100	We're going to go to another break, and then when we come back, I want to make some big announcements.
2132240	2138623	We have a big announcement to make tonight regarding a giveaway, a really, really big giveaway that we're doing.
2138923	2143065	You've heard us talking about it for a while, and we even promised it would happen a couple months ago, but it didn't.
2143325	2146426	But that's all right, because it really, really is happening soon.
2146486	2147306	We actually have a date.
2147567	2150428	We have the prizes in our possession, and if you don't know what we're talking about...
2150768	2154290	We're going to talk about it when we come back from this break, featuring more of the Ultramix 2 VRare.
2155031	2158073	Also tonight, we're going to hear some stuff from 2DX Red at some point.
2158153	2164237	So in this break, a lot of you guys in the chat room were requesting to hear the Max 300 remix, so we're going to make that happen for you guys.
2164777	2167979	And as well as some Gyrus, the new Gyrus mix is awesome.
2168139	2172782	And then I know there's some fans of Day Behavior too, so we'll throw them in there as well.
2172822	2174463	So we will be back after this.
2174543	2175884	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
2321306	2338235	I was picked up for a TV show It's called P24 I am the girl that you all know To love, hate or adore I've been waiting all my life Just to be seen Seen by everyone I wanted to be someone
2514232	2522816	Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.
2522856	2530900	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
2531420	2534321	We are live here on this lovely Sunday evening, as we are every Sunday night.
2535042	2537903	This is a big week for those of you guys that are Xbox fans.
2538323	2539704	I know a lot of you guys have Xbox.
2539924	2541485	Huge game coming out Tuesday.
2542233	2542954	Biggest release.
2543274	2544995	I know you've been waiting for it all year long.
2545595	2548297	Karaoke Revolution is coming out for Xbox on Tuesday.
2551280	2552580	I know you can't wait for it.
2553121	2557504	Now I hear that folks are going to be lining up around the corner at midnight to buy this game.
2557584	2558405	So it's pretty crazy.
2559325	2561107	But just, you know, don't riot please.
2561447	2562327	Let's say orderly.
2562368	2564469	There's enough Karaoke Revolution for everyone.
2564649	2568112	I hear that they expect that there could be extra copies on the shelves.
2568252	2568892	Just a couple.
2572242	2574943	No, but seriously, Karaoke Revolution, what the hell?
2575063	2575923	It came out of nowhere.
2576403	2584005	Like, I know we were talking about Karaoke Revolution, Xbox, a couple weeks ago on the show, and then suddenly, I remember Iguana Girl made a post in her live journal.
2584025	2585986	She was actually talking about Karaoke Revolution Volume 3.
2586186	2587146	Volume 3, yeah.
2587286	2591487	Because, you know, Iguana Girl and I have been known to do some karaoke in the past.
2591907	2599057	and one of the songs that's being featured happens to be something that both Sky and I used to do on a semi-regular basis.
2599378	2600559	Back when we actually spoke.
2600760	2606668	And for those that are really interested, there is a file.
2606748	2607349	Jesus Christ.
2607769	2617935	on the internet that you can find somewhere at a particular convention that a particular Sky and I went to.
2618055	2619776	Actually, that was when we first played DDR.
2619796	2622198	That was the same weekend that we first played DDR.
2622218	2626740	So if you want to see what I look like the first time I played DDR with this hideous zit right on my nose.
2627721	2628562	The hideous face!
2628642	2629422	The hideous face!
2629442	2630283	Oh my God, the face!
2632444	2633925	But yeah, if you're...
2634801	2640466	If you're coos enough to be able to find it, then, you know, that file is still out there on the internet so far as I know.
2640486	2646510	Just think about what... Now, pop quiz, you guys, think about what Iguana Girl and I talked about during the last little banter session, okay?
2646610	2647731	So, you might be able to find it.
2648212	2648412	Yeah.
2649673	2652315	Alright, so anyway, Iguana Girl posted KREF3...
2656573	2664259	And I knew, I had heard the Karaoke Revolution 3 had duets, and I even remember looking at an early song list, but I just kind of skimmed it because there were so many songs.
2664700	2667162	I don't even remember connecting that, oh my god, Love Shack was in it.
2667542	2669103	Because maybe at the time I didn't care either.
2669904	2670284	I don't know.
2670745	2671906	Oh my god.
2672146	2672326	What?
2672346	2673427	That Love Shack crap.
2673647	2675629	Oh, I don't want to hear that.
2677210	2679873	GameFacts.com GameFacts.com
2693625	2695066	and the Karaoke Revolution 2 booth.
2695166	2695846	Yes, exactly.
2695866	2700168	Because, you know, they had a nice little seat and it was air-conditioned and I liked to sing.
2700428	2701728	And they had the little Logitech microphones.
2701748	2702108	It was fun.
2702208	2702809	Yeah.
2702829	2705249	Little handhelds, which, thankfully, we're getting.
2705470	2708371	It was assumed that, okay, well, we'll get to try this out next May.
2708411	2709031	But I was kind of going...
2709611	2713973	I don't know, it just seems like, you know, to put out the song, six months to wait for that?
2714013	2714354	I don't know.
2714414	2719977	So I decided to look for a street date, and sure enough, GameFacts.com, I bring it up, says 11-9 is the street date.
2720437	2722018	I'm like, is Xbox coming out the same day?
2722038	2723779	Sure enough, Karaoke Revolution Xbox, 11-9.
2723799	2727801	A date you guys might have heard of for certain releases of certain games.
2728681	2728861	Yes.
2730222	2732243	So, I have no idea where the hell this comes from.
2732343	2733344	Do you have any idea, Mel?
2733384	2739007	I know you have some of the inside scoop at Konami, but do you have any idea how the hell this just blindsided us all?
2739714	2743578	I think what all boils down to is it just makes marketing sense.
2743658	2751486	I mean, KR1 did really well, KR2, you know, followed up pretty nicely, and hey, it's holiday season, why not milk the product for what it's worth, really?
2751906	2753108	I think that's what it boils down to.
2753128	2758913	Well, I don't think it's any surprise that we're getting a karaoke revolution 3 and duets, Logical's next step in the right direction, but...
2759758	2760499	That was fast!
2762180	2769207	It really wasn't that hard to, you know, I mean, 1 and 2 were pretty much not that different, you know, aside from just one extra in the mode.
2769847	2781939	And it's pretty safe to say after they did, like, KR1, they had already been working on KR3 because it's really just kind of like drop this in and, you know, you just kind of add on top as opposed to redoing a whole new engine.
2782833	2786576	Yeah, I mean, it pretty much looks the same, but now you've got duets, which is kind of cool.
2787297	2792961	Now you guys all out there in Radioland will have to find a friend to play this game with.
2793562	2794522	Please go out and find a friend.
2794803	2799747	No, please, in fact, just for the sake of having a life.
2799767	2800387	No, I'm kidding.
2801928	2803870	But this is good, because now Iwana Girl and I can practice.
2804430	2809514	Because you know, someday, at our favorite bar, they have to do a duets contest.
2809655	2810936	Someday, it's got to happen.
2811735	2814176	I think we need to talk to our favorite KJ about making that happen.
2814196	2815377	Because we've got to win that.
2817298	2818639	So we can spend the money on games.
2820299	2822100	Because I'm going to be fucking broke after November.
2822120	2823021	I don't know about you guys.
2824422	2825602	Quick poll, going around the room.
2825942	2827343	Games you're looking forward to by the end of the year.
2827363	2830105	It doesn't have to be Babani, just any games you're looking forward to by the end of the year.
2831485	2834007	Oh man, there's still more stuff out there.
2834127	2835327	I don't know, it's kind of hard to say.
2835347	2839109	Well, obviously, yeah, you know, the 8th style is definitely the one I'm looking forward to.
2839670	2840190	And, um...
2840885	2844408	I'm still looking forward to Rumble Roses, that's going to be pretty dope.
2846269	2848331	Yeah, that does come out Tuesday, awesome.
2848811	2865605	It seems like most of the games I'm looking forward to have already come out, and it's like, you know what, I need to look forward to more, man, I'm still catching up on like three or four more games, you know, it's like, maybe by March, you know, I'll be caught up, and then by that time E3 rolls around, and it's like, great, more anticipation, you know, in May, and so on and so on.
2866238	2876704	I figured they're just kind of blowing everything out now because once next-gen systems come out, you know, obviously those first launch titles usually kind of blow ass and, you know, but yeah, I think Romo Bros.
2876724	2878646	right now is definitely high on my list.
2879386	2879806	Sounds good.
2879826	2880987	Shark Skrull, anything you're looking forward to?
2881883	2887888	Right now it's mostly like Ultramix 2 and 8th Style because I've got all this stuff.
2888168	2890150	I just got Donkey Kongo a month or two ago.
2890170	2891110	Oh, how was that?
2891671	2892672	Oh, I love that game.
2892692	2894453	We didn't get a chance to pick it up for the show here.
2894553	2895494	That and Tycho, we completely missed.
2895514	2896675	I am so freaking addicted to it.
2896755	2898456	I just sit there and just bop away.
2898496	2899657	My mom's like, what the hell are you doing?
2899677	2900898	I'm playing Kongo, leave me alone.
2901979	2906562	And my friend from Nashville, Cincinnati, everywhere just came back and he's got it too.
2906663	2908224	So I found someone I can play with.
2908723	2910805	I might have to buy this too before the next time I visit.
2910945	2911165	It's fun.
2911185	2912626	It will drive your mom crazy.
2912646	2913447	It's a lot of fun.
2913867	2915949	But, yeah, you know, I got that.
2915969	2916830	I just got Burnout 3.
2917150	2918711	I got Star Wars Battlefront.
2918851	2920212	I got Katamari Damacy.
2920252	2922154	I'm just catching up to everything I've just bought recently.
2922194	2923054	And Dr. Mario.
2924015	2927458	The freaking crack game from way back.
2929279	2929680	So, yeah.
2930320	2931801	I'm just catching up to what I already bought.
2931821	2932662	Right on.
2932742	2933263	For the most part.
2934263	2934644	Sounds good.
2935164	2936225	Islander, what are you looking forward to?
2937823	2939504	Like Mel, I'm looking forward to Rumble Roses.
2940785	2945568	Pretty much everything that I'm looking forward to has already been released.
2947729	2949130	There's a lot of things I still need to pick up.
2949730	2953512	Probably, for example, MK Deception.
2953852	2954993	I still want to pick up just for MK1.
2955013	2958935	You have to get the Collector's Edition for MK1, though.
2958975	2960896	I bought Deception, but it doesn't have MK1 on it.
2960957	2961597	Yeah, okay.
2961697	2962718	So yeah, I know about that.
2963898	2964939	Other than that, there's...
2965831	2978922	There was a few others, but I mean recently we just picked up, you know, of course we have Extreme, Katamari Damacy, Madden 2005 for me, and SmackDown vs. Raw for myself, and between those four games, I mean, there's still stuff on Extreme that I haven't unlocked yet.
2980203	2988731	I mean, because I've got so much stuff to play, so most of the stuff I've been looking for has already been released, so I just need to, you know, just kind of save up for them.
2990072	2990312	Right on.
2990372	2991413	Iguana Girl, what are you looking forward to?
2993463	3001034	Well, I would officially like to start the Iguana Girl Really Needs New Games Fund because I am too damn broke to be able to afford anything.
3002296	3007403	I would really, really love to be able to get A-Style, but first I'd love to get 7-Style, a new controller.
3009305	3013648	It's kind of helpful to have a controller that functions.
3013668	3015049	Do you have a PayPal you want to plug?
3017331	3018332	If I could remember the name, I would.
3020613	3026678	I'm incredibly broke and trying to make ends meet, but almost out of debt type of deal.
3028019	3030703	I would love to get 8th style, I'd love to get 7th style still.
3032105	3036091	And I would love to get an Xbox to be able to play the Xbox versions of games.
3036993	3040278	And also, of course, because I'm a karaoke whore, Karaoke Revolution 3.
3041650	3042130	Very cool.
3042210	3042530	Navi.
3043051	3045291	And I bet you not a single one of his games are going to be domestic.
3046512	3047973	Actually, yeah.
3048173	3052034	Well, as far as ones that have yet to be released.
3052754	3058177	I still want to play Deception and San Andreas, but just haven't really gotten around to it.
3059117	3061298	I am so looking forward to...
3061843	3063364	Any interest in the US version at all?
3090885	3091265	Probably not.
3093446	3093706	I don't know.
3093746	3096308	I haven't checked out any song listings for that yet, though.
3097788	3100730	But... God, what else was there?
3102151	3106733	Supposedly, the sequel to Karate Mani Damashii is still supposed to be out before the year's over, so...
3108843	3112425	Oh, well, the Japanese one came out in February.
3115546	3116607	They haven't given a release date on it.
3116627	3120689	They're being all super secretive on it, but I think it still says it's supposed to be out before the end of the year.
3121109	3126312	And then I think I'm going to go get one of those Dragon Warrior slime controllers.
3127112	3128313	Those are so cute.
3128813	3130174	What site can they go to to check those out?
3130454	3132895	Actually, they're now up for pre-order.
3132995	3133916	I just checked last night.
3133936	3136978	They're up for pre-orders at NCSX and Japan Video Games, and they're $45.00.
3138680	3138840	Yeah.
3139320	3139580	Okay.
3140501	3140881	Arcadian.
3142902	3151385	I think the only thing I'd be anticipating would be 8th style, because there's so many things, even, there's so many songs I like in that mix, in that style.
3152185	3154086	Even though I haven't played, like, 7th style in months.
3155127	3161589	Mainly because I, since I do typing and stuff all day, it's kind of hard to do more stuff with my hands.
3163870	3166471	And nothing really else, because I hardly follow games anymore.
3166491	3167412	Aw.
3167672	3168132	Well, that's alright.
3169649	3177595	I haven't touched my Japanese PS2 in months.
3177615	3178496	It feels so neglected.
3178536	3181098	It's crying in my room under the pile of laundry it's under.
3184000	3186703	I need to cuddle with it tonight and let it know I still love it.
3186743	3188165	I just, you know, have no use for it.
3188765	3192990	There's some rejection.
3193070	3195293	Poor thing's going to go crying off to the Xbox now.
3197295	3200419	Oh my god, my JPS2 is going to elope with my GameCube.
3203030	3206351	Ever since Josh and I stopped playing Four Swords, I haven't touched the GameCube either.
3206371	3207072	They're going to elope.
3208052	3209032	You'll get the GS2.
3212334	3214694	DarkSakura, what are you looking forward to this holiday?
3214774	3219296	Definitely ApeStyle, which I actually have to go and play Asia and make my pre-order.
3221217	3227759	Actually, I know for sure I'm getting the Taiko no Tatsujin US one, because Dan basically slipped and told me he was getting it for me.
3228560	3232001	Although he made an interesting slip something about an arcade-style controller, but...
3232748	3235129	for GDX.
3235149	3236930	We were talking about expensive presents.
3238531	3241173	Jamie's favorite kind, for those listening, by the way.
3243414	3250539	I don't really think I'm going to get it, but I was talking about a $400 set of Copic markers that I wanted.
3250839	3252840	They had it at A1 Comics, and I was like,
3253300	3257724	I really want this, but I would rather have a tablet, because I want a nice big art tablet.
3258065	3261288	He was like, well, you could get that, or you could get an arcade-style controller.
3261568	3262649	And then he didn't say anything else.
3263430	3264991	I was like, ooh.
3265371	3266312	Very interesting.
3266532	3266873	Very.
3267613	3270176	Although, honestly, I want to try actually building one.
3271525	3276769	And I haven't seen any place now that has 2DX arcade style controllers for anything less than $500 now.
3276909	3278410	Wasn't there a third party that was making one though?
3278430	3278590	Huh?
3278770	3280632	Wasn't there a third party that was getting one to make one?
3280812	3281492	I don't know about that.
3282113	3285835	There's tons of third parties for pop and music arcade style controllers and they're only like $250.
3285915	3288877	But yeah, they've gone up like $150 since I got mine.
3289157	3289978	See, I can just make one.
3289998	3292219	That's crazy.
3292279	3292620	Wow.
3292720	3296182	I found all the schematics to make one myself so I could do it if I had time.
3296202	3297243	But...
3300080	3304281	As far as any other game, I definitely want Katamari Damacy 2.
3305061	3309683	I'm sort of in about DDR right now just because I'm so busy with everything else I don't really have time to play.
3311763	3315104	I was actually thinking about getting the DDR aerobics game though.
3315924	3316865	Cute.
3317105	3317605	What was it?
3318937	3321618	I remember it was Aerobic Revolution or something.
3321638	3322679	I was thinking about it.
3322719	3323579	I was sort of happy.
3323719	3325860	We heard it was coming out and then we didn't hear anything else.
3325981	3328062	The game I want that already came out in the U.S.
3328122	3329002	but it's really crappy.
3329382	3331223	I decided to import Bujingai.
3332344	3334945	It's the game with Gakuta as the main character.
3335125	3337046	Now somebody had sent me a link about this.
3337426	3338567	Gakuta was doing a voice.
3338827	3340027	I think Dark Knight was telling me about this.
3340047	3341088	He's the whole character model.
3341448	3342008	That's awesome.
3342288	3349753	The game, it was, in fact, I put pictures in my live journal way back when, you know, when they were actually in production of the game.
3351253	3357977	But it just looked really, really awesome, and I heard that they really, really butchered it for the U.S., but now the import's going to be cheap since the U.S.
3358017	3358697	version is out.
3359238	3359418	Oh, okay.
3359438	3364721	The live importers should have it really cheap, but I have to go around jumping around from, you know, building to building as Gak.
3364741	3366782	Gak didn't have to... And all of this fabulousness.
3367122	3369083	He didn't have to speak in English for the English one, did he?
3369403	3370484	No, they probably got somebody else.
3370504	3370844	I don't...
3372302	3375907	I can't hear another voice with that.
3376268	3378992	I have to have his, you know, voice.
3379853	3381416	It just doesn't, I wouldn't be right.
3382537	3383258	Alright, anything else?
3384741	3386223	Hopefully a game where I can shoot things.
3387284	3387525	Right on.
3388767	3416237	Um, as far as my, uh, top three games for this holiday season, I would say number three is a tie, um, 2DX8Style, I gotta get, I know it's gonna get me back into 2DX, which I'm sure makes Navi, yeah, he's grinning over there, cause, he missed, I guess, I suck now, and it used to be like, Navi and I would have little friendly competitions about, you know, who can beat this song first, and then at one point I just said, ah, fuck it, you beat him, and I just kinda quit 2DX, but I think 8Style might get me back into it a little bit, but it's kind of a tie, because Rumble Roses,
3416977	3417778	I really want it.
3417998	3424402	And this is strange because, and this is no secret to those of you who listen to the show, I'm a gay guy.
3424483	3425763	Since when did you turn straight?
3426704	3427305	You know what?
3427585	3428545	It's hilarious.
3428826	3438753	I mean, the thought of women kicking the shit out of each other in mud wrestling to Bomani music type stuff because the artists are doing it, it's hilarious to me.
3439161	3445807	Well, I mean, jeez, I'm a straight chick, and I love playing DOA, Extreme Beach Volleyball, and putting them in the tiniest little freaking bikinis I can find.
3446008	3446548	Exactly.
3446668	3447409	I do it all the time.
3447449	3453835	There's something about being able to kick the shit out of, you know, become a woman that can kick the shit out of everybody.
3454676	3454996	I don't know.
3455717	3459521	No, and I'm not one of those, like, transsexual whatever's, okay, I just...
3460145	3460885	I think it's fun.
3461045	3472128	Then after they've slowly beat each other to submission in the mud, they slowly strip off the clothes and go at it in a very aggressive sexual, uh, yeah.
3472748	3474509	Rob is all about empowerment.
3474629	3475249	I need to tell.
3476649	3487012	No, um, before we get too far away from it, the third party controllers I was thinking about for 2DX would be Controlica, which is a new site that's actually come out.
3487352	3489053	They're going to be selling, supposedly in the winter, um,
3490682	3495844	2DX arcade style controllers that are supposed to be on par, or if not better, for $3.75 plus shipping.
3497145	3504448	And based on their popping music controller, which looks just like an arcade style controller, all metal, really nice, it should be pretty good.
3506405	3507426	Thank you for watching!
3522902	3524503	I want Halo 2 really bad.
3524523	3524964	Me too!
3525064	3525925	Oh my god, me too!
3526325	3528467	And we can play online and I can run over you with the Warthog.
3529427	3530068	Well, this is the thing.
3530128	3543058	Okay, you guys have to understand that back when I was in college, my buddies at Sonoma State, I had a bunch of friends that went to Sonoma State over in the Bay, and they all had a really fast internet connection, so they would set up Quake servers, and I used to get on there and school them at Quake.
3543118	3544019	I was really good.
3544119	3544779	Don't listen to them.
3544880	3545980	I was the best at Quake, okay?
3546801	3549083	And so now the Halo 2's out and it's on Xbox Live.
3549164	3552727	Like everybody that was in college, that little circle of friends in college, they have an Xbox.
3552747	3553888	They're all getting Xbox Live.
3553908	3556411	So it's like we're going to relive the old days through Halo 2.
3556731	3557452	It's so precious.
3557972	3559614	So yeah, I really, really want Halo 2.
3559694	3560355	So shut up.
3560455	3560855	Don't hate.
3561256	3562197	Why do you suck now?
3562377	3562717	Shut up!
3564379	3565660	Because he's gay, duh.
3567762	3569825	Now I remember why we haven't had you on the show in a year.
3571581	3572401	Just kidding.
3572501	3575063	And then my number one, absolutely DDR Ultimix 2.
3576263	3577724	I believe it's going to live up to the hype.
3578044	3579165	I think it's going to be awesome.
3579405	3583907	I have no doubt it's going to be a Bomani fan's wet dream this winter.
3583987	3585908	So I'm looking forward to it, definitely.
3586348	3590130	And I'm also looking forward to being able to play, and Sigurd has already accepted this challenge.
3590530	3595133	I'm going to play Sigurd on this show, live, and beat him at his own steps.
3595813	3598334	That's the challenge that's on the table right now.
3598374	3598935	Are you listening?
3599235	3599675	You listening?
3601465	3601985	It's on!
3602265	3603106	It's already been broughten!
3604286	3604726	All right.
3606206	3607107	Okay, was that everybody?
3607167	3608727	Loki, I didn't get your top three.
3608747	3610828	What are you looking forward to this holiday season?
3613088	3613389	Give me.
3615109	3618590	I don't know if this is coming out within this time frame, but Alien Hominid.
3621331	3621771	I don't know.
3621831	3623272	I don't pay attention to this shit.
3623992	3624372	God.
3625242	3626683	So that one looked really awesome.
3628163	3630144	Did I tell you about that last time I was here, though?
3630504	3630924	Nope.
3631004	3634566	Oh, yeah, you mentioned it, but then wasn't it like your friend or something?
3635406	3639267	Yeah, my friend James, his friend is the one who designed it.
3639588	3640228	Looks awesome.
3640308	3640568	Yes.
3641608	3642449	So that one would be cool.
3644830	3649351	Gosh, really, as far as video games, I'm not looking forward to anything, to be honest.
3649972	3653293	Really, E3, I was just kind of, eh, you know, so...
3654682	3656883	No, there's not really anything I'm looking forward to at all.
3657404	3660286	Um... No, I can't think of anything.
3660886	3666370	Unless, um... Well... Well... You know what?
3666390	3669592	You got Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, and you can beat Cop Senseless with your pimp cane.
3669692	3671473	I don't know if there's anything else that really you need.
3673095	3676880	They could always have a Driver 4 so that I could see even worse AI.
3677841	3678242	Wow.
3678582	3680324	My god, that game sucks.
3681286	3684490	I just, the only reason I play it is just to see how bad it sucks.
3686332	3688034	And, you know, it's great.
3688154	3690638	And it's funny, though, because Grand Theft Auto San Andreas...
3691258	3696162	There's a point in the game where you have to go into this rapper's house and steal his rhyme book.
3696723	3701006	And he's playing Driver 3 and seeing how bad it sucks when you walk by him.
3701627	3702247	It's great.
3703048	3711395	The other thing I'm really looking forward to, and hopefully they'll get it out by winter 2004, it's In The Groove, the home version.
3715635	3717997	Dot, dot, dot.
3718117	3719118	No, actually, I don't care.
3719498	3724862	But I would like to see Pump It Up exceed.
3724982	3725483	Yeah.
3725503	3726344	I would like to see that.
3726404	3727565	Yeah, that looks interesting.
3727585	3732308	Even though I don't play Pump It Up and I despise the arcade, I'd still like to see it because it'd be something different.
3735811	3739394	God, you know, I don't know.
3739454	3741095	All the good games have already come out.
3741135	3742977	Most of the Konami ones are already out, so...
3745332	3747813	Well, you know, I don't know, I can't think of any good ones.
3748494	3758301	I guess Metal Gear Solid 3, but I don't like even playing Metal Gear Solid 3, or Solid, or Solid 2, so, I don't know, the, uh, the DS, I guess?
3758641	3760122	I don't know, that might be pretty cool.
3761483	3765606	So they can start re-releasing, oh, a new Animal Crossing game, if that ever comes out.
3766787	3768148	Animal Crossing DS would be cool.
3770000	3775166	You know, these are those times when I'm very grateful my man works where he does, so I can get my free DS.
3775306	3775826	Absolutely.
3776707	3778489	Hey, have you gotten a copy of the Ultramix 2 VR?
3779470	3781252	He's got it, he just hasn't brought it home for me yet.
3782033	3782333	Interesting.
3782373	3786478	I know those are hitting the shelves, so if you haven't found yours yet, go bug your local GameStop.
3788135	3788576	It's great.
3788636	3789317	It's a great CD.
3789498	3791941	I mean, even if it wasn't even DDR related, it's still a great CD.
3792021	3797750	And I think it is just awesome that for the first time we have full length versions of songs that weren't done by Konami.
3797770	3798532	That's pretty cool.
3798812	3801957	I mean, not that Konami songs are bad, don't get me wrong, but it's just neat to have other stuff on there.
3802037	3803279	So check it out if you haven't yet.
3804502	3814826	I don't know if you guys noticed this, and this is out in the Ultramix 2 thread over on the Freak right now, so there's no secret, but that AlienC16, whatever the guy's name is, his website...
3824990	3825170	T.O.Y.
3848314	3848614	Let's see.
3851757	3854699	Well, okay, I want to talk about some things that are going to be coming up on the station.
3855079	3856000	Obviously, I teased this.
3856060	3857581	We've got a contest that's going to be coming up.
3858001	3861104	And Floatwalk, you were a big part of helping hook us up with this.
3861424	3865427	I'm actually going to, if you don't mind, DarkSakura, I'm going to bring up the cam for a minute because I want to put these on the cam real fast.
3865787	3866668	But let us know about it.
3866708	3872132	We've talked about it on the station a little bit before, but remind us again, Floatwalk, what are we doing with our buddies at DDR Spot right now?
3872392	3878160	Well, DDR Spot, for those who actually come visit us once in a while, we'll reward you.
3878700	3883286	Because roughly around next week or so, we're going to relaunch basically another version.
3883947	3888633	And obviously it's going to be more or less coinciding with Ultramix 2 coming out and such.
3889756	3891778	Orange Lounge is doing a giveaway, as are we.
3892178	3895881	And we're doing the same gifts, actually, which I have brought up finally.
3896661	3901805	As you know, of course, me being the man and all that kind of stuff, I got my hookups here and there.
3902365	3907329	And those in Orange Lounge, I know a bunch of y'all are Kira Yamaoka fans.
3907409	3916556	So we got four of his promotional CDs, which are actually like little mini CDs, which have, I believe one of them is the...
3917898	3918798	What's that song?
3918838	3919819	Room of Angel, I guess it is?
3920099	3923600	Yeah, it has that, and then it has a spoken track on it afterwards.
3923980	3928782	It was some kind of promotional giveaway in Japan, and he has autographed all four CDs.
3929442	3936404	So those who want to get a piece of the man, they are more than welcome to try.
3940405	3942346	But let's see what else is going on.
3942486	3945447	Yeah, that's our big giveaway for the time being.
3946667	3950329	There's probably more we might have in the future, but be grateful for what you have.
3954391	3956392	So this is the way the contest is going to work, boys and girls.
3956412	3960374	We're going to start this contest on... I've got to bring up the calendar because I forgot.
3960834	3962535	It's not tomorrow, but a week from tomorrow.
3962575	3965296	November 15th is when this contest is going to start.
3965316	3966396	It's going to run for two weeks.
3966797	3967317	Here's the deal.
3968459	3974343	Monday nights, Tuesday nights, and Thursday nights, Orange Launch Radio has certain spin-off programs.
3974363	3975084	You might have heard of these.
3975144	3980708	Diversion on Mondays, Pump Up the Volume on Tuesday, and Outside the Box moving to Thursday nights this week.
3980748	3985111	So starting on the 15th, on each one of these shows, we're going to ask a trivia question.
3985511	3987733	Something about Akira Yamaoka, something about Silent Hill.
3987773	3990795	It won't be too difficult, but you know, my challenge, you might have to do a little research.
3991355	3993217	We're going to ask you a question on each one of these shows.
3993677	4011753	Then, for each week, because we have two CDs, we're going to be doing this for two weeks, at the end of each week, we'll take all the emails with the correct answers, and we'll be drawing one randomly, and whoever gets all the answers correct, and we pull them randomly out of the hat, they win a signed Kiriyama Oka Silent Hill 4 Limited Edition CD.
4011853	4012794	It's imported from Japan.
4013194	4013734	DarkSakura.com
4038653	4042276	You're considered a regular and you're not eligible.
4042356	4045098	But a lot of you guys would be eligible to win DDR spots.
4046178	4049200	And vice versa, DDR spot staff could be eligible for ours.
4049841	4050962	So, something to think about.
4051482	4054284	Alright, so you got some competition out there that we all want the CDs.
4054624	4055825	I would love to keep them.
4055965	4059307	I think we'll just close the station down tomorrow and I'll just keep them.
4060448	4061569	Alright, no, we're going to be doing that.
4062498	4066201	If it's any consolation, even I'm not keeping an autographed CD.
4066241	4068542	These are all, you know, sharing to the people.
4069103	4073005	Of course, you know, I have my own autographs of his, but that's neither here nor there.
4076408	4076688	All right.
4077849	4078889	Also, I got a big announcement.
4078909	4085534	A lot of people in the room don't even know this one yet because we just got the okay on it just a couple hours before you guys all got here.
4086014	4088056	But next week, we're going to have an interview.
4088236	4091478	Our very first Bomani artist is going to be on the show.
4092489	4094650	Conception from DDR Ultramix 2.
4094690	4095970	He did the song Altitude.
4096010	4097091	He's going to be on the show next week.
4097551	4098151	So check it out.
4098171	4098931	He's not going to be here live.
4098951	4104234	We're going to talk to him over our brand new Skype out thing that we've got where we can call him and we're going to be talking to him.
4104954	4107295	And we might have another one in the next few weeks.
4107975	4108415	We'll see.
4108595	4108875	I don't know.
4108895	4110456	I don't know if you want to say anything on it or not.
4112728	4122699	We might also have the guy behind the most kick-ass remix in Bomani, in my eyes, the MidiHead remix, MidiHead.
4122759	4125582	We might have MidiHead, so we're working on that.
4126283	4126803	We're working it.
4128485	4130087	This could be the beginning of something beautiful.
4131328	4131648	We'll see.
4131688	4133430	Now I'm looking forward to asking Concepcion a lot of questions.
4133450	4134632	I feel like real radio.
4134732	4135673	I know, it's so weird.
4137284	4141670	Pretty soon, you know, we'll outgrow this little apartment studio thing we got going.
4141770	4143072	That means we can have a compound.
4145375	4149741	We might have to sell ads on the site because people might actually want to get known out there.
4150522	4151504	So that's definitely interesting.
4151524	4152906	We're going to ask Conception a lot.
4154714	4159797	of questions about how he became hooked up with Ultramix 2 and what his music's like.
4159837	4161618	He's actually going to send us a song, too.
4162219	4166041	And I don't think a lot of you guys have heard it yet, so we're going to play that for you guys next week on the show.
4166101	4167742	So stay tuned for that.
4169903	4170423	Let's see.
4173405	4174005	What should we do now?
4174025	4175026	Are we going to go to break?
4175406	4175846	Let's do a break.
4176047	4176507	You guys want a break?
4176527	4177327	We can break things.
4177427	4178008	Yeah, let's do a break.
4178448	4180269	I think... How much longer are you guys going to be here?
4181730	4183431	Another segment, I guess.
4183451	4183791	Another segment?
4184622	4185182	Maybe another hour?
4185222	4186863	Okay.
4187483	4191704	Let's see if we can't do some good old-fashioned Bomani match game tonight.
4192384	4192664	Okay?
4193305	4194605	Here's how it's going to work, though.
4194625	4196526	We're going to get a caller on Skype.
4197066	4207589	And, of course, what we do when we get somebody on Skype, they will get to challenge either Float Walk, Shark's Girl, Islander, or Iguana Girl, or Navi, or Arcadian 42.
4207949	4211390	They can pick somebody to challenge on tonight's Bomani match game.
4211430	4212331	So that should be a lot of fun.
4212351	4213111	You guys up for it?
4213511	4213711	Yeah!
4213991	4215372	Navi, what's up with 2DX Red?
4215392	4215672	The game's out?
4215692	4217893	It came out the day after the site went up.
4241299	4245881	Well, the official, it was like the 27th or 28th of October.
4246041	4246382	It went up.
4247602	4247782	Yep.
4249363	4249703	It's out.
4250063	4250624	What else do you want?
4250824	4251544	I've had a brain fart.
4252885	4254005	I bring the microphone to you.
4254265	4254886	I stalk you.
4255946	4256706	Oh, okay.
4257367	4258127	Yeah, brain fart.
4258607	4259888	English, do you speak it?
4260488	4260828	English.
4261309	4261749	It's red.
4262369	4263209	It's very red.
4264350	4265210	Things about it.
4265330	4266891	There's, God, it's another 2DX mix.
4267051	4267211	There's
4269730	4271032	I don't really know what all there is to be said.
4271072	4274277	You just need to listen to that music.
4277463	4281750	I'm annoyed at the site right now, though, because there's no artwork for me to download to make my desktop wallpaper.
4285202	4288545	I'll have you give me inspiration, Loki, then I'll do something intelligent for once.
4288645	4289346	Okay, 2DX Red.
4289686	4292449	Basically, it's the 11th game in the series.
4292789	4294130	We've got brand new additions.
4294311	4300376	First off, you've got on the side, while you're playing the game, it's actually showing you progress, basically, kind of like the combo meter in...
4301357	4307320	Keyboard Mania, so you can see how you're doing versus the max combo in the game.
4307880	4315844	The other thing that's being added to this game is also High Speed 4, which I don't know if that's more of a challenge or helpful, but that's also being added.
4317505	4322567	Then we've got the addition of, was it 8 plus stars?
4322587	4327109	They've broken down the ratings into 1 through 8 and Flashing 8s.
4327189	4330431	Flashing 8s now are just songs like
4331171	4333052	A and Kakumei, and stuff like that.
4333892	4335693	There's been plenty of songs that have been upgraded.
4335733	4343056	Some that I thought were kind of weird to upgrade, like Zero One's now an 8, and Linus is an 8, and a bunch of other crap.
4345357	4350220	Most of the... A lot of old artists, the regular artists, are not in it.
4350320	4355482	They are off doing other projects right now, so they have revived... A lot of old artists...
4356161	4361303	like fourth style kind of stuff like... Nobunood or... No, no, no, that was a fake.
4361723	4362183	That was a fake?
4362203	4362703	That was a fake.
4364303	4365244	There's no Superhighway?
4365264	4366604	No, there's no Superhighway.
4366624	4368525	Yeah, there was no Voter of Stellum either.
4369565	4372066	No, they revived Wall 5.
4375187	4376187	I love their new song.
4377768	4380368	If you see the new video for it, it's really cool.
4380388	4382109	It's like a bunch of twitching animals to the song.
4385350	4388732	Baby Weapon, DJ Swan from 5th Style.
4389833	4396916	There's actually a handful of artists that, you know, like, when the 2DX, when the remix album for 10th Style came out, we're all, who the fuck are they?
4396956	4399498	Well, now they have their own songs in here.
4399878	4405381	DJ 19, DJ Tomo, I think DJ Yoshitaka was one of the ones that was on the 10th Style remix album also.
4405401	4408142	I'm glad to see Ryu doing something other than happy hardcore.
4408382	4410884	His new song isn't as great as they were in 10th Style.
4410964	4411444	I like it.
4412024	4414545	I forget what his song was though, but it wasn't... Be Quiet.
4415125	4415505	Be Quiet.
4415765	4417266	I love that song, it's awesome.
4417726	4423468	I love that, um... God, um, I can't understand what the fuck Paul Terry is saying.
4423928	4427389	Oh, she sucks, again.
4427529	4431871	I'm sorry, she's only good with, um, um, um, um... What's her name?
4431931	4433311	What's the guy's name?
4433371	4436272	Is she out of key, as usual?
4436452	4437233	Well, you know what's really weird?
4437253	4438253	Because, like, anything...
4440555	4440975	Red Zone
4462748	4463948	Have you heard it?
4464629	4469830	It's Tatch and Naoki, and it sounds like some really old DDR song.
4469890	4477773	Naoki, I mean, he needs to just go under another alias and just stay under that alias and never, ever, ever, ever go back to Naoki again.
4478153	4483134	Because, honestly, I mean, I like Euro... No, I don't like Eurobeat.
4483154	4484535	I'm not going to try to lie there.
4486876	4490918	No, stuff like B4U, Brilliant to You and stuff, that was good back then.
4490938	4492139	That's what Red Zone sounds like.
4492359	4496741	Stop making the same damn song over and over and calling it something different.
4496761	4502244	I think it's really funny that Red Zone sounds like that, but he's in collaboration with a new sound producer.
4503085	4507847	Slake is no longer a sound producer on this, but apparently he's got three songs in the mix already.
4508608	4509828	Um, uh...
4511309	4523034	But yeah, as like old artists that are no longer with the mix, this current mix right now, we will not be seeing Mr. T, Tak, Shoichiro Hirata, huh?
4524995	4525655	God, I'm forgetting.
4526555	4530577	There was a ton of them that just, that aren't in there, or at least aren't in there yet.
4531637	4536980	Now, was any of the artists that, what was it, from like, I think it was from like 9th style,
4538536	4540638	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4559894	4564216	One of them is Tayo, and the other one is D-A-N-C-E.
4565197	4568398	What the hell is up with a guy being in B4U?
4568418	4569358	That's what I want to know.
4570259	4575301	I mean, you gotta either feel sorry for him, or he's the luckiest bastard in the world.
4575321	4577562	What are you talking about?
4577582	4579402	There is a guy in the group B4U.
4579422	4580503	There is not a guy in B4U.
4581323	4582143	There is a guy!
4582303	4583543	I swear to God it's a guy!
4583723	4587424	You want me to point it out?
4587724	4588264	Show me the guy!
4589264	4589985	Show me the guy!
4590105	4593685	I want to see this!
4593705	4597066	There were five people that won the Bimani Vocal Audition.
4597486	4604487	Three of them are now members of B4U, and one of them was the chick that has the two songs in 2DX right now, and another one is a guy.
4604767	4607648	He has not had any songs that I know of yet.
4608528	4609368	And where are you going?
4612421	4614182	This is your high quality radio right here.
4614222	4614743	No, no, go to Konami.
4614803	4616324	You talk, I'll get there.
4636397	4642601	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4665757	4674005	It's a key, key, essay, key, I believe is the name of the song, by B4U, and the new Orange Lounge song, and I'm going to try and say this with my French accent.
4674625	4676027	Les fillets, bon accès.
4676087	4679110	Let me read it, I'll say it.
4679190	4681392	Yeah, Shark Skrulls are going to be going, I know French, let me read it.
4682573	4683914	We'll try to get her over here after the break.
4684475	4687177	Okay, we're going to go to this break, we will be right back.
4687217	4687618	Have a good one.
4744025	4744586	Thanks for watching!
4820237	4820701	Thank you.
4938939	4939681	DarkSakura
4997160	4998168	Thanks for watching!
5043365	5048232	From StepSquad to Orange Lab, this PDR sucks!
5048292	5051497	Holler, holler, holler, holler, holler, holler, holler!
5057386	5059526	Hello and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
5059546	5061607	Yay, Step Squad.
5061687	5063447	I love everyone.
5063467	5064527	Step Squad.
5064707	5067748	We have several little DDR factions in house.
5067768	5069288	We have representation from RTF.
5069888	5071709	We have representation from Step Squad.
5072249	5074589	And we have representation from the Nobodies.
5074689	5075070	Thank you.
5076070	5076930	All right, DarkSkull.
5077170	5078230	Big fat Nobodies.
5078550	5079890	BFN for life.
5080331	5081051	For real.
5084167	5085827	I'm representing Heaven's Gate.
5086007	5087508	I just forgot to drink the Kool-Aid.
5088908	5091329	I think a new DDR squad has just been born.
5092129	5093449	BFN, Big Fat Nothing.
5093529	5094350	Is this our gang sign?
5094370	5094750	What is this?
5095030	5095830	Why do we keep doing this?
5095870	5099091	I don't know.
5100631	5102752	Hey, Navi, want to be in BFN?
5103492	5104192	Oh, yeah!
5104492	5104912	Yeah!
5105252	5105512	All right.
5108213	5110433	Actually, BFN should be that, Big Fat Nothing.
5111494	5111954	Okay.
5113591	5115513	We'll be taking applications a little later.
5116033	5116334	All right.
5118235	5118936	That's BFL.
5119036	5123200	That's a little different.
5123320	5125822	Of course, a few people said I was in the GFR squad.
5128585	5134470	Anyway, so speaking of GFR, did you get this guy in B4U situation sorted out?
5136974	5142097	Yes, yes, yes, it's not B4U, but he's just some ugly guy that's in a picture with B4U people.
5142998	5152404	Anyways, it's this guy named Reija Sakurai, and looks like, I don't know, he's going to be singing something for some Bomani game.
5153384	5154064	Poor bastard.
5154425	5159468	He could very well be in the... And he'll be giving head at Vellfire.
5161369	5164991	I know, I wouldn't be surprised if he's in one of the CS songs for Poppin' Music.
5169866	5170687	I don't know.
5170967	5175031	I'd like to segue for about 30 seconds here to give you your In The Groove update.
5175711	5178353	Because everybody's got to know.
5179014	5182217	This Halloween, to celebrate Halloween, they have an Unlocked song.
5182337	5190884	Anubis, the god of death, and Florida, as if you need another reason not to go to Florida, just got In The Groove.
5192305	5192565	That's all.
5197842	5198542	What part of Florida?
5199402	5199683	What city?
5199703	5202404	The back part, I don't know.
5202484	5208548	Well, it's just because I'm going to be, you know, not an hour away from Pensacola.
5210068	5212830	I mean, at the end of the month, I'm going to be an hour away from Pensacola.
5215611	5218093	And that, ladies and gentlemen, was your In the Groove update.
5221149	5221649	All right.
5224791	5225891	We're so mean to them.
5226311	5233374	I mean, seriously, there's a point where... I feel bad because I did give a review and there are some good things about the game.
5233715	5233955	Some.
5234555	5235355	Very few, but some.
5235595	5235855	All right.
5236936	5238156	All right, yeah, it's not DDR King.
5238537	5239097	All right, anyway.
5241306	5242848	We actually have a special guest.
5242868	5248672	Somebody actually messaged me on Skype and said that they wanted to come in and talk to us for just a second.
5248712	5250233	This is a very special guest.
5250473	5252694	I know at least one person in this room is going to get a kick out of this.
5252714	5255196	So I'm actually going to give him a buzz right now.
5255216	5256637	Let's see if we can get him on the line here.
5259940	5260420	Hello?
5260860	5262621	Hi, is this Travis?
5264363	5264743	Who?
5266684	5267425	You know, Travis...
5269505	5269825	Yes.
5270205	5270545	Hi.
5270705	5271466	Hi.
5272646	5273286	How are you?
5274006	5274407	I'm good.
5274467	5275187	How are you guys?
5275407	5275767	Good.
5276167	5282269	I thought maybe you'd want to say hello because this is the first time Iguana Girl and I have been on the air together since Under Station Live.
5283509	5287671	And with everything that's happened in the last couple weeks, this is proof Armageddon is here.
5288311	5290712	That's Travis.
5290852	5291812	Travis, I miss you.
5291872	5292492	I love you.
5293372	5295013	And you're looking good, baby.
5296019	5297601	Oh, he's stalking you on our webcam right now.
5297942	5299223	Hey, hey, 40 pounds lost, baby.
5300405	5301826	Looking good.
5303509	5305050	Put your pants back on, Travis, please.
5305952	5306953	I don't think Jenna would like that.
5307053	5307253	I know.
5307974	5309155	I like doing it in my pants.
5312199	5314302	All right, Travis, do you have anything you want to plug?
5315382	5319243	Oh geez, is this, is this, okay, let's talk, I'm gonna get him off the air.
5319684	5322705	No, I'm just, I'm just asking the logical follow-up question, is there anything else?
5322725	5325786	No, the logical follow-up question would be, what does he want to plug?
5327106	5327646	Your butt?
5330767	5332148	I really have nothing to plug.
5333028	5333829	Nothing to plug?
5334229	5335029	We already plugged you.
5336750	5338050	That's not the first time that happened.
5341651	5342111	Thank you.
5342292	5343572	What's going on with Understation Live?
5344787	5345927	Not a damn thing.
5347107	5350048	Well, that's why I wanted to give you a chance to plug it so folks can go listen to it.
5350668	5350928	Why?
5354129	5355209	We don't even listen to it.
5357630	5358950	We don't even do the show.
5359850	5360770	You don't do the show anymore?
5362511	5364731	Well, if that's what you call wasting a Saturday.
5365391	5367392	Well, I thought that's what you... That's what we always used to do.
5368452	5368672	I know.
5368712	5370852	What's changed since Jessica and I were on there?
5370872	5372112	It's called a baby.
5373013	5373193	Aww.
5373953	5374173	No.
5374193	5374433	Kira.
5375933	5376693	How is the baby doing?
5377654	5378474	She's a little shit.
5380115	5381716	I bet she makes a lot of little shits, too.
5382696	5383576	No, she makes big shit.
5384777	5387038	Big, stinky, chunky shit.
5387458	5390800	Are you going to get her to play DDR?
5393061	5395802	Oh, in your wildest dreams, boy.
5397522	5401024	I still love that Too Unlimited video you did.
5402325	5405346	I actually just watched it just the other day.
5407219	5414524	I had been working on others, but my job unfortunately takes so much time away from me, I don't even have time to sit down and update my live journal.
5416145	5416806	Yeah, we noticed.
5417966	5420328	Thank you.
5420688	5422650	But how are things on the left coast?
5425011	5425772	Left as always.
5425952	5426392	It's good.
5427833	5428734	I don't know.
5428874	5429234	Sunny?
5429694	5430115	I don't know.
5431434	5431954	Rainy.
5432615	5432995	Angry.
5433396	5434276	Cracking up.
5434797	5435637	Sad.
5436258	5436798	Sad.
5438199	5438659	Mad.
5439340	5441982	Well, actually, let me ask Rob this.
5442042	5445805	How do you feel about yourself, you, Rob, running for public office?
5446866	5447826	I've contemplated it.
5447886	5448687	I seriously have.
5448767	5454972	But I just don't think, because kids don't vote, the youth doesn't vote, I think if I were to run, I would have to get the youth vote connection.
5455032	5458154	And in this area, which has a bunch of retired citizens, that ain't going to happen.
5458935	5460556	I've given it serious thought in the past, though.
5461095	5462775	Well, have I got news for you.
5462995	5463436	What's that?
5464536	5465736	Alright, is everybody sitting down?
5466076	5466356	Okay.
5467617	5468537	Everybody got their towel?
5469157	5469517	Okay.
5470297	5471438	Don't forget your towel.
5473158	5473978	I have an announcement.
5474918	5475259	What's this?
5476159	5477619	As I talk really close to the mic.
5477739	5479200	Okay, well we can hear you just fine.
5479780	5480780	Okay, so everybody shut up.
5486981	5488802	Seeing what has happened in the last two weeks...
5489753	5499936	With the election, a country divided, one side against another, people burning down houses, cars, accosting people.
5500797	5503577	Half the country likes one person, half the country likes the other person.
5504058	5505398	I've decided to take a stand.
5507119	5513841	I, Travis Donovan, officially announce my candidacy for President of the United States in 2008.
5516832	5519513	Um, Travis, wait, wait, wait, wait, Travis, Travis.
5520133	5522334	Hang on, just make me stop the music.
5525236	5527917	You're not going to be 35 by then.
5528677	5531199	You have to be 35 at the time of the inauguration.
5535641	5537982	Birth certificates can be altered by a month.
5540894	5546779	I have decided I am running for president, and if that doesn't work, I'm running for governor of Texas in 06.
5550202	5551503	Thank you, thank you.
5552443	5553825	Hang on, hang on.
5554325	5555406	I got my crowd here too.
5557988	5558448	There we go.
5558508	5560970	Well, you do realize what this means.
5561971	5563032	Now I have to run.
5564573	5565954	Far, far away.
5565994	5566595	Far, far away.
5567625	5568005	Damn it!
5568226	5574091	And I just put that whole rant in my live journal about how I wasn't going to move to Canada, but now I'm reconsidering.
5574772	5577795	Well, I have two propositions for you on that.
5578496	5579997	Are you going to legalize gay marriage?
5581979	5582840	Let's not go there yet.
5583661	5587504	Because after all, I'm the working man for the working people.
5588665	5589006	Alright.
5589406	5589827	I work.
5590487	5590808	Thank you.
5592623	5594043	No, here's my propositions for you, Rob.
5594203	5594483	Alright.
5595124	5596024	I'm running for president.
5596124	5596424	Alright.
5596984	5599304	I'm gonna need a vice presidential candidate.
5599665	5599985	Alright.
5601205	5601845	You're it, Rob.
5602345	5603225	Woohoo!
5605026	5606026	I am so there.
5606066	5608146	But wait a minute, you're a Republican and I'm a Democrat.
5608186	5609367	Could that ever possibly work?
5611567	5612447	Yeah, and your point?
5612667	5613247	Well, we'll find out.
5613287	5613567	Alright.
5613587	5614428	You know what?
5614728	5616408	This is a perfect opportunity.
5616468	5620849	Like, I've been ranting about it in my live journal to throw away the stupid bipartisan bullshit.
5621417	5621837	That's right.
5622498	5624039	Travis and I can come together.
5624059	5625420	Abandon the party mindset.
5625661	5627122	I don't want to hear that.
5627822	5629784	If we can come on each other, we can come together.
5630224	5634548	Now, you're making a Guana girl sad because she doesn't know what she's going to do.
5635228	5636490	She doesn't get to be vice president.
5636590	5637170	What can she do?
5639712	5642034	Let's fire Condoleezza Rice and put Jess in there.
5642575	5642795	No.
5643175	5643395	No?
5644136	5644776	What does she get to do?
5645897	5648680	Because I don't want to... I get to stand around and have big boobs?
5649360	5649680	No, I...
5651007	5651867	Secretary of Big Boobs.
5651887	5654188	There's an idea.
5655208	5656369	No, I actually gave that some thought.
5656469	5658750	Jess can be Secretary of Agriculture.
5662251	5664892	So long as I get to play with the cows.
5665512	5668213	You have to be the Secretary of Agriculture.
5669893	5674955	Because I figure you want a woman who PMSs as far down on the chain of succession as possible.
5681411	5682872	I haven't calmed down at all.
5683952	5685213	I'm just zoning you, Travis.
5686273	5688254	Now great, you just lost us a vote.
5688354	5688914	Way to go.
5691055	5691916	Way to go, Trav.
5693116	5694897	I didn't say everybody was gonna like us.
5696558	5697918	I'm honest and upfront about it.
5698019	5700960	I'm gonna be plain spoken for the plain spoken people.
5701560	5704281	I will have no problem telling candidates to shut the fuck up.
5706607	5713011	I will have no problems pointing out that my running mate is gay.
5715152	5718114	I don't need the other candidates to tell me this, I've known this.
5719775	5720515	I'm here!
5722497	5726059	What was the point of John Kerry pointing out to Dick Cheney that his daughter was gay?
5726339	5727800	No shit, I think he knows!
5730937	5733538	Actually, that was Edwards that did that, but yeah.
5733598	5738320	Were you expecting him to have a revelation and a heart attack right then and there going, Jesus, she's gay!
5740061	5744182	I don't think so.
5744262	5745783	I'm seriously considering this.
5746263	5747704	It's a grassroots campaign.
5748044	5749885	It's a third party kind of thing.
5749905	5751545	Well, we have to come up with a name for the third party.
5753026	5753906	The People's Party!
5754026	5755027	The People Party!
5755607	5755887	I like that.
5756385	5761507	and if anybody can access the social... It could be the house party.
5763327	5765028	Travis and Rob's house party!
5765088	5765968	All the best!
5767329	5767789	I like it.
5768149	5769270	Totally live!
5769370	5773711	Well, we're going to have to get my people in touch with your people and people things.
5774311	5775172	I don't see that happening.
5777272	5784335	You think I'm all crazy because I live out here in Texas because, oh, I'm sorry, as people have pointed out in this last week, I'm a redneck because I live in Texas.
5785222	5789785	Well, I don't think you're a redneck.
5792826	5795828	As people pointed out, now it's time for the South to secede.
5797809	5800090	Yes, the rest of us are going to form the United States of Canada.
5800150	5801211	Ha ha ha, you're right.
5801411	5803792	Well, this is my second condition.
5804132	5809595	If you're serious about going to Canada, along with all these other people who want to leave the country... Of which I am not.
5809735	5810736	I would never leave to Canada.
5811332	5838799	if you were to sign a legal binding document that you will get your ass out and never come back I will personally start donating to the U-Haul truck to get you the fuck out and I will use big bills as I've said before just because the guy I did not vote for and did not want to win won that does not mean I hide my tail behind my legs and go to Canada that just means I have to yell a little louder
5839289	5840750	No, you just sit there and bitch and whine.
5840970	5842291	Exactly, that's what we do.
5842631	5843591	It's the American way!
5844152	5844852	Damn straight!
5845733	5846973	America, fuck yeah!
5847233	5849355	Exactly, exactly.
5850035	5853377	No, but my question was, did you... Sorry.
5853757	5860421	Did you expect, Rob, on the next day, Wednesday, to see a big, gloating thing in my live journal?
5861761	5862282	Actually, no.
5863522	5863923	Why?
5864003	5866324	Because I think everybody knows that kind of stuff's in poor taste.
5868110	5870232	Obviously, not a lot of people in LiveJournal did.
5870632	5872313	I didn't really see a whole lot of gloating.
5872333	5874474	I mean, if anybody... I'm not talking about gloating.
5874774	5879798	Most of the people I knew, if they gloated, I could have said, well, California went blue, so... But, you know.
5880958	5881879	But, I mean, it doesn't matter.
5882079	5885421	I mean, it happens, so... Only half of California went blue.
5886982	5887403	55% went blue.
5887503	5887803	Get it right.
5888343	5889604	That's half of California.
5889944	5891325	Only 44% went red.
5891426	5892406	Just FYI.
5892566	5892847	Anyway.
5892867	5895649	We don't need to discount the over 4 million popular votes.
5896389	5896710	Anyway.
5897090	5897550	But anyway.
5898151	5899472	Can't we all just get along?
5899772	5900733	Can't we all just get along?
5901553	5901793	No.
5901813	5904636	Can't we all just forget about bipartisan shit?
5904656	5907318	Let's just have a bipartisan orgy and be done with it.
5907938	5908178	No.
5908599	5909419	Get rid of it.
5910080	5912882	Get rid of the electoral college and parties.
5913062	5913362	Uh-uh.
5913502	5913682	No.
5913783	5914103	Stupid.
5914123	5914243	Stupid.
5915009	5916830	No, the electoral college is not stupid.
5916850	5921311	I've had this debate with you guys back in 2000, and I'm going to have it over and over again.
5921691	5924952	It gives the small counties with the less population... Alright, alright.
5925092	5926472	You're not having that debate on this show.
5926612	5929053	We have stupid 12-year-old games to be talking about.
5929313	5929633	Okay?
5931473	5932994	Speaking of stupid 12-year-old games... Yes?
5934554	5935895	Are you going to be on Halo 2?
5936595	5936995	Of course.
5938111	5940732	I get to frag a fag.
5940812	5942332	I get to frag a fag.
5942453	5945554	Yeah, most people in Texas would be, you know, happy about that.
5945594	5946174	Anyway, no, I'm kidding.
5946674	5947414	Oh, come on.
5947434	5949455	It's been four years since we lynched a queer.
5949535	5951095	I accept your challenge, Mr. Donovan.
5957236	5960977	Well, you better, Mr. Roberts.
5960997	5966599	And then when I kill you, I'm going to say, Ha ha, you got your ass kicked by a fag.
5968060	5972881	Just like I do to the little hecklers that try to challenge me on ADR.
5974402	5978823	And then we put Jenna's 10-year-old nephew on, and he kicks both our asses, which he does on a regular basis.
5979624	5979964	All right.
5980384	5981004	Which is scary.
5981224	5984826	All right, we've got to cut it short, because we've got to get to the bit that we stole from USL, okay?
5985426	5985926	What bit?
5986414	5987175	Uh, the match game.
5989017	5991700	You copyright stealin' motherfuckin'.
5992501	5994924	Uh, wouldn't it have been copywritten before?
5994944	5996625	You stole it.
5996645	5998227	Copywritten and trademarked.
5999148	6002632	But I stole it, like, one hundredth time down the line.
6004654	6005315	It's homage!
6006116	6007798	Imitation is the finest form of flattery.
6009841	6010441	Love you, Travis.
6010921	6011561	Yeah, whatever.
6011661	6012062	Bye.
6012782	6013262	Bye.
6013562	6014122	Bye, Travis.
6014302	6015462	That was nice to have him on the show.
6015522	6016663	Yay, Travis.
6016723	6017443	That's exciting.
6017463	6019683	I've never been asked to be a vice presidential candidate before.
6020003	6025765	I've been asked to be somebody's maid of honor, but never the vice presidential candidate.
6025925	6026885	That's going to be amazing.
6027085	6027605	I'm excited.
6028225	6028485	All right.
6028705	6030986	We are going to open it up for match game in just a minute.
6031066	6035327	However, we had one other person that wanted to talk to us in the studio.
6035367	6037127	Yes, we're going to make another call, believe it or not.
6037888	6039348	So let's go ahead and make that call.
6039707	6040127	Right now.
6045431	6046011	Oh, there we go.
6046071	6046451	Yay.
6046591	6047732	One ringy-tingy.
6050174	6050514	Hello?
6051615	6052855	Hi, is this Shane?
6053636	6053976	Yeah.
6054336	6055477	We can barely hear you.
6055557	6056698	Can you talk louder or something?
6057899	6058579	Is this loud?
6059139	6059660	Somewhat.
6059700	6061901	We can, like, barely, barely hear you.
6062902	6063262	What's up?
6063282	6064022	That sucks.
6064343	6064783	Nothing.
6065563	6066224	Can't yell.
6067240	6068321	Okay, well, what's up?
6068501	6070583	You wanted to say hello to some folks here, or what's up?
6071484	6072605	Yeah, hi everybody.
6072625	6072665	Hi!
6076308	6077189	How's it going for you?
6078070	6078650	I'm sick.
6078910	6079571	You're sick?
6079711	6081593	Oh, another sick person, great.
6081813	6082153	Yeah.
6082894	6083754	What are you sick with?
6083915	6084395	Well, I'm puking.
6085036	6085556	I'm not sure.
6086156	6086277	Oh.
6087017	6093563	Well, unfortunately the volume is so low that it's hard for us to hear you right now, but do you have anything you wanted to say since we called you?
6093583	6093663	Yeah.
6095027	6107616	I want to say that everybody needs to buy Karaoke Revolution for Xbox this week so Halo 2 doesn't take all the sales because I don't want to keep selling Halo 2 this week.
6108877	6113220	And watch Drawn Together on Comedy Central because it's funny.
6114501	6117743	And that's it.
6118224	6121066	And is there any Ultramix 2 songs you're looking forward to?
6122884	6124425	Yeah, but I can't say them.
6124625	6127147	Oh, I thought he was going to say Baile La Samba.
6127668	6129089	Oh, well, I already said that last time.
6129129	6129409	Alright.
6129689	6130090	Alright.
6130530	6131631	Okay, Baile La Samba.
6132111	6134473	We'll play Baile La Samba just for you a little later.
6135334	6135894	Okay, cool.
6136035	6139397	Alright, well, I'm sorry, we're going to have to let you go because it's too quiet, but you have a good one, okay?
6139417	6140478	Okay, you too.
6140518	6141259	Everyone say bye, Shane.
6141299	6141659	Bye.
6141679	6142400	Bye, Shane.
6142440	6144221	Come back to California, you bum.
6144421	6145382	Play Final Fantasy.
6146643	6147564	Alright, I hope he heard that.
6147824	6150286	They said, come back to California, you bum, and play Final Fantasy.
6152352	6153032	I think he already hung up.
6153152	6153392	Oh well.
6154313	6156293	Hopefully he hears that when it comes through a little later.
6158334	6158594	Alright.
6160795	6161355	Let's see.
6161755	6163956	What we're going to do now... Should we get into Match Game?
6163976	6165196	You guys want to take a quick break?
6165236	6166157	Alright, let's get into Match Game.
6166437	6167597	I've got to find the Match Game music though.
6168657	6169598	How about a one song break?
6170078	6172239	We want to do just a quick little break while we set up?
6172539	6173019	That would be good.
6173619	6174299	A quick one song break.
6174519	6175920	You know, everybody's been wanting to hear...
6176943	6178605	What was the song that I wanted to play for people?
6178625	6182168	It's called Set People On Fire I don't remember, what was it?
6200763	6203491	Oh, it's Baile La Samba, since we just talked to Shane, of course.
6203531	6204213	We're going to play this one.
6204233	6205636	We'll be back right after this.
6205757	6207782	It's Baile La Samba from DDR Ultramix 2.
6207963	6208303	We'll be back.
6227114	6227594	and many more.
6267740	6268601	Thanks for watching!
6305239	6307121	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
6307141	6311824	We're going to get into the Monty Match Game pretty soon here.
6312305	6314927	We're just trying to get the files copied over that we need.
6315847	6316308	All right.
6317849	6320191	So the way this works, we're going to open up the Skype line in just a minute.
6320631	6323013	And just as a reminder, there's a little bit of a buffer.
6323033	6328517	So you're going to want to watch for the little icon to turn green because that's really the moment when we're starting to take calls.
6328878	6331279	So the first person through will get to play Match Game tonight.
6331339	6333821	And you get to challenge somebody in the room.
6334722	6335483	but not one of the hosts.
6335503	6338565	You have to challenge a guest because that's the rule that I just made up.
6339686	6341127	That was very Izzard of you.
6341427	6342328	Thank you.
6343208	6344269	Cake or death.
6345490	6349913	So you get to challenge one of the guests and all the other guests will be answering questions.
6349933	6355197	So the way Match Game works, we have a little statement that we read and the statement has a blank in it.
6355737	6357018	and then you have to fill in the blank.
6357058	6360420	You want to try and match as many other people in the room on the blank as you can.
6360440	6364282	We're going to make it a quick game tonight because Shark Skrull and Floatwalk, unfortunately, they have to get out of here pretty soon.
6364902	6365983	So we have to kind of make it a quick game.
6366003	6367264	It's going to be a three question game tonight.
6368044	6369285	It's like Mad Libs, only not.
6369785	6371046	Yes, it's like Mad Libs, only not.
6371186	6371526	Very good.
6371586	6375228	So let's find ourselves some match game music here.
6375688	6378410	It's not the same match game theme, but it's good.
6381231	6382212	Price is Right car music.
6386775	6387756	A new car!
6388716	6390177	You've won the Geo Metro.
6390538	6392119	Alright.
6393240	6395881	Let's see what happens when we open it up and get a caller.
6395981	6401145	And remember, if we can't hear you very well, we are going to have to boot you and get somebody else.
6401185	6403647	So the skyline is open and let's see who we get.
6404107	6405088	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
6405128	6405528	Who's this?

6427078	6429159	So I'm gonna put us back in do not disturb mode.
6430199	6433821	Alright, so John, the first question is, who do you want to challenge tonight?

6602888	6604289	So this is what you gotta do.
6604790	6612516	You gotta send a private message to Order of Chaos on DDR Freak and say, Spanky in 2004.

6617841	6618261	Alright.
6620943	6622805	Alright, so we have Mr. Spanky playing tonight as well.
6623205	6626348	Sounds like some tough celebrities you gotta win over tonight.
6626388	6627109	John, you up for it?
6628936	6629457	I'm up for it.
6629577	6630277	Alright, here we go.
6630337	6631378	You ready for question number one?
6631958	6632198	Sure.
6632318	6632879	Alright, here it is.
6633239	6634079	Question number one.
6635200	6645746	Rob was so excited to be going to GameStop to get his copy of Karaoke Revolution Volume 3 on this lovely Monday night at the Halo 2 pre-sale.
6646667	6654611	But when he took the game to the counter, the clerk looked at the game he was buying and said, You're buying Karaoke Revolution instead of Halo 2?
6655212	6657393	Karaoke Revolution must be really blank.
6661573	6661793	Right?
6662194	6664236	You gotta let the celebrities think about it, John.
6664296	6664656	Hold on.
6667199	6671444	He looked at the game he was buying and said, You're buying Karaoke Revolution instead of Halo 2?
6672284	6674387	Karaoke Revolution must be really blank.
6694383	6696524	The celebrities are writing their answers.
6696564	6698746	Have all the celebrities dinged in?
6698806	6699987	Raise your hand if you're dinged.
6700007	6701287	Still thinking, DarkSakura?
6701347	6701968	Oh, okay.
6722791	6723611	You got it, Sharks Girl?
6728693	6729033	Alright.
6731074	6731734	Alright, she's got it.
6731754	6732094	Here we go.
6732114	6735295	We're going to have Navi go first, your competition tonight.
6735335	6736336	Let's see, Navi.
6737276	6740577	Rob was so excited to be going to GameStop to get his copy of Karaoke Revolution Vol.
6740757	6748000	3 on this lovely Monday night at the Halo 2 presale, but when he took the game to the counter, the clerk looked at the game he was buying and said, You're buying Karaoke Revolution instead of Halo 2.
6748420	6750781	Karaoke Revolution must be really hot.
6753035	6754116	All right, John, what do you think?
6754176	6758118	Karaoke Revolution must be really... A huge sleeper.
6758918	6759579	Huge what?
6760159	6760599	Sleeper.
6761060	6762100	Huge sleeper.
6762240	6763001	Like a sleeper hit.
6763041	6764422	You know those games that are really underground?
6764762	6767263	All right, neither answer perverted in the slightest.
6767303	6768864	We'll see if that pays off or not.
6769264	6769605	Let's see.
6769645	6771145	We got Hot and Big Sleeper.
6771446	6774607	DarkSakura, Karaoke Revolution must be really... Super!
6774888	6776048	Super!
6776168	6777009	Not a match, sorry.
6778630	6782092	Floatwalk, Karaoke Revolution must be very...
6783032	6785414	Well, since it's Microsoft, it must be Green with Envy.
6785954	6788196	Ooh, Green with Envy.
6788436	6789457	Interesting, all right.
6790298	6791439	Shark Skrull, but not a match.
6791799	6798284	Shark Skrull, Karaoke Revolution must be very... I've been playing way too much Katamari Damacy and playing the Pisces one, so it must be really fresh.
6798945	6799485	Fresh!
6801527	6804669	Islander, Karaoke Revolution must be really... Neato.
6805170	6805810	Neato!
6806170	6806651	Not a match.
6806891	6807471	Sorry, guys.
6808512	6810394	Iguana Girl, Karaoke Revolution must be really...
6810762	6811322	Hetero.
6811563	6812624	Hetero.
6813484	6815766	Ooh, going for a little bit of that reverse psychology there.
6815886	6816787	Like it, but not a match.
6817447	6817868	Arcadian.
6818728	6821511	I particularly heard full of before that, so I say porn.
6821771	6822251	Full of porn.
6822531	6823492	Full of porn!
6823512	6824973	I hope not.
6825514	6826775	But we'll see on Tuesday.
6826855	6827636	Alright, not a match.
6828376	6830418	That's close to hot, but not close enough.
6831018	6833000	Loki must be very... Gay.
6833020	6833080	Gay.
6835245	6836966	I think you went for the obvious one.
6839347	6842489	I was going to put gay people, but I'm like, no wait, that's what the question was the other way around.
6843910	6851194	I said, karaoke must be very much for people into water sports because the box is yellow.
6854235	6859598	Forget it.
6859678	6860979	It's all tied up with a big nothing.
6861659	6863340	Let's go to the next question, shall we?
6863941	6864441	You ready, John?
6865353	6865513	Yep.
6865713	6866174	Alright, here we go.
6867574	6867975	Alright.
6868535	6873838	DarkSakura was all excited to be getting a really expensive present for Christmas this year.
6874679	6879422	She was really excited to see a big package come from an Orange Lounge radio fan.
6880422	6887687	But when she tore off the wrapping paper, she started burninating the Christmas decorations in a fit of rage when she saw that they had bought her a blank.
6896087	6898611	The celebrities are currently thinking of their answers.
6899473	6901496	When they saw that they had bought her a...
6931409	6934351	Alright, everybody, uh, everybody, ding-ding?
6934631	6935832	Okay, ding-ding-ding?
6936192	6937993	Alright, here we go.
6939634	6941034	Alright, John's gonna start us off this time.
6941054	6941555	You ready, John?
6942235	6942395	Yep.
6942655	6947758	Alright, uh, DarkSakura was all excited to be getting a really expensive present for Christmas this year.
6948158	6951640	She was really excited to see a big package come from an Orange Lounge Radio fan.
6952020	6958104	But when she tore off the wrapping paper, she started burninating the Christmas decorations in a fit of rage when she saw that they had bought her...
6959577	6960417	A flamethrower.
6960718	6962418	A flamethrower!
6962899	6964620	Oh, because that's why somebody would burninate.
6964640	6965540	Very logical.
6965600	6966460	Will logic pay off?
6966601	6967741	Probably not, but we'll see.
6968522	6972704	Navi started burninating when they saw they had bought her... A Foreman Grill.
6973064	6974344	A Foreman Grill!
6975205	6976746	I got one of those for Christmas once.
6977786	6978186	Alright.
6979247	6980588	Started burninating the steak.
6981248	6987171	Let's see, DarkSakura, what did you start... You started burninating when they bought you a... King of All Cosmos package.
6987694	6989815	King of all Cosmos package.
6991476	6992196	I see.
6992276	6993357	Okay, very nice.
6993497	6994598	That would be a large package.
6994678	6994858	Good.
6995458	6999100	FloWalk, Bot Hurray, Apolitary Poster.
6999120	7000861	Apolitary Poster!
7002342	7002942	Oh, not a match.
7003542	7005243	Excuse me, I'm going to go be violently ill.
7005503	7006244	Shark Skrull.
7007085	7008666	A box of ferret poison.
7008886	7010647	A box of ferret poison.
7010908	7011868	Awe, I made her cry.
7013049	7014630	Islander, a blank.
7015231	7016031	A bag of boogers.
7016331	7017652	A bag of boogers!
7019854	7022596	Dear DarkSakura, I'm your number one fan.
7022696	7023937	I picked these just for you.
7028510	7030691	Sadly enough, I could see that happening with some of our listeners.
7031151	7031631	I'm just kidding.
7031751	7032131	Love you guys.
7033772	7035772	I'm your number one pick every time.
7035792	7037833	Iguana Girl.
7039173	7041334	Ironically, mine's actually along the same vein.
7041954	7042214	Okay.
7042334	7044475	Huge piles of feces.
7044915	7046815	Huge piles of feces.
7047315	7047736	Shade marks.
7048056	7048536	Not a match.
7050336	7050616	All right.
7051197	7054277	Arcadian, we're looking for... I forgot the answers now already.
7054298	7054738	A big fact is...
7057031	7060314	with a karaoke machine of Politary's greatest hits.
7060634	7063256	Oh, a karaoke machine of Politary's greatest hits.
7065818	7066479	Chirp chirp.
7067059	7067539	Loki.
7069221	7075966	You know, it's sad that no one got Jamie's because mine was the king of the cosmos, Severed Cock.
7078472	7080033	That would be a big package.
7080533	7081734	Mine's somewhat similar.
7081854	7087697	I said that she burninated everything when she saw that the present was a dildo modeled after Naoki.
7090558	7091418	How would I find it?
7092599	7093259	Let's move on.
7093639	7094020	All right.
7095140	7095640	Very nice.
7096421	7096701	All right.
7096761	7097461	It's all tied up 0-0.
7097481	7099062	John, are you going to break this tie?
7100062	7100543	We'll see.
7100743	7102244	Navi, are you going to break this tie?
7104385	7104665	Maybe.
7104945	7105165	All right.
7105185	7105465	We'll see.
7105485	7106005	Here we go.
7106245	7107126	Question number three.
7109457	7113940	We here at Orange Lounge Radio have become very concerned about Loki.
7116142	7116722	When haven't we?
7116762	7117183	But here we go.
7117503	7118964	We've been very concerned about Loki.
7119264	7122286	He's been playing a lot of Grand Theft Auto this week.
7123007	7126669	And he started to blur the line between San Andreas and real life.
7127930	7132073	The other co-hosts got very concerned of this when Loki went around in blank.
7136497	7138318	The other co-hosts got very concerned that...
7139028	7142530	Loki was taking Grand Theft Auto a little too seriously when Loki went around and blanked.
7161319	7164661	The celebrities are currently thinking, please wait.
7174986	7175306	All right.
7175866	7176406	Well, let's see.
7178047	7178827	Are we going to get a winner?
7179287	7179847	We'll find out.
7180207	7180948	Anybody still working?
7182008	7182208	All right.
7182228	7182608	Here we go.
7183588	7183928	All right.
7185069	7187729	It all comes down to this.
7189370	7191671	We here at Orange Lounge Radio have become very concerned about Loki.
7191711	7196612	He's been playing a lot of Grand Theft Auto this week, and he's starting to blur the line between San Andreas and real life.
7197092	7200393	The other co-hosts got very concerned of this when Loki went around and Navi...
7201195	7204838	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7225780	7233265	and the outfit of some stereotypical thug and tried to jack a plane, crash into the ocean, steal a semi and listen to the light FM while shooting at people.
7234026	7234846	Very descriptive.
7234967	7236247	I like that, but not a match.
7236668	7237368	Shooting at people.
7237708	7238009	Alright.
7239089	7241051	Well, but now, it's a little too much.
7241071	7243953	That doesn't necessarily mean I hit them, therefore not hurting them.
7244233	7244613	Alright.
7245414	7245914	FloWalk.
7247635	7249036	Chase them with the purple dildo.
7249136	7251098	Chase them with the purple dildo.
7251198	7251538	Not a match.
7252219	7252659	StarScroll.
7253291	7256052	Jumped out of a plane screaming, it's a mile drop, I'll live!
7259553	7260814	This is true, this is true.
7261234	7261614	Islander.
7262134	7263835	When he said, bitch, I'm gonna kill you!
7264895	7265876	Bitch, I'm gonna kill you!
7266056	7268376	Very close to capping your ass, but not quite.
7268436	7268917	Iguana Girl.
7269137	7269837	That was boring.
7269937	7270937	Hijacked a helicopter.
7271157	7272278	Hijacked a helicopter.
7273380	7277123	You know, that would have been exciting if Loki really did that, but I don't think I would have been concerned.
7277643	7278684	You know how to fly a helicopter?
7279044	7279364	We'll see.
7280325	7281045	Alright, Arcadian.
7281465	7282526	Ran over pedestrians.
7282926	7284547	Ran over pedestrians.
7284567	7285188	He does that anyway.
7285228	7286449	Not a match, he does that anyway.
7287029	7287369	Loki.
7287950	7289591	I would have figured that would have been a match, actually.
7290051	7290952	Alright, let's see here.
7291332	7295094	Shooting the po-po and pimping crack hoes to make some fat scratch.
7298957	7300158	Lovely, lovely.
7301259	7308005	And my answer was, the other co-host got very concerned with this one, Loki went around and killed DarkSakura with his pimp cane.
7313590	7315371	I got a ferret thrown at me for that one.
7316532	7317133	Alright.
7317593	7320095	Well, let's review the scores, boys and girls.
7320156	7322498	Let's look at how our contestants did tonight.
7325820	7327342	Let's look at the final scores!
7330764	7336106	And in second place is Navi with zero points!
7337167	7341128	And a tie for second place is John Fields with zero points!
7341909	7346411	Congratulations John and Navi, you are our big losers tonight.
7347391	7352013	So Navi, you get a frown, a collective frown from those of us in studio.
7352073	7352333	Ready?
7353754	7357075	Alright, and John, do you know what you get for your score tonight?
7358177	7359438	A frown from the chat room.
7359598	7363820	No, you get hung up on.
7363900	7364620	What a good sport.
7364800	7365741	Alright, he tried.
7366241	7367441	They always fall for it.
7367481	7368562	I hang up on them every time.
7368582	7369402	They always fall for it.
7371604	7373625	All right, no, thanks seriously for playing, John Fields.
7373645	7374265	It was a good time.
7374605	7377887	Too bad about the, you know, no answers or anything, but, you know, it happens.
7378367	7383710	Anyway, I guess Shark Skrull and Floatwalk are going to have to be leaving us soon because they've got a long drive home.
7384510	7391634	But, you know, I quickly wanted to ask Floatwalk and, you know, Shark Skrull just some, you know, general questions.
7393355	7397717	Floatwalk, anything, I guess I should ask you about
7398370	7399311	Ultramix 2 Ultramix 2 Ultramix 2
7421309	7435814	I was hanging out with Jason Enos last night, so he gave us a kind of a scoop on why there were delays and all that kind of stuff, and it's actually pretty funny, but only people who are in the test group would appreciate such bumblings, I guess, for lack of a better term.
7436234	7442216	You know what, I'm starting to get a little nervous there, that we're going to have to wait for Christmas to see Ultramix 2, but it's good to know that it looks like it's still on target anyway.
7442617	7444897	Yeah, it's looking to be pretty good.
7444977	7447998	I mean, right now, things are pretty happy in the DDR camp.
7448098	7449459	Extreme sales have actually...
7450605	7461229	Well, what Jason did was he was comparing Max 2 sales along with Xtreme, how they've been doing week by week, and Xtreme's been doing a good, like, up to around 33% better than what Max 2 has been doing.
7461489	7462130	Very nice!
7462210	7468252	So they're looking, even projecting around holiday season, they're probably going to be jumping Max 2 figures by about 40%.
7468352	7468592	Wow!
7468792	7471813	So, you know, things are going well for that.
7472433	7474794	Max 2 has almost hit 500,000 units.
7475094	7475515	Very nice!
7475615	7478956	So, you know, I mean, who knows, it could be a greatest hit someday, but
7479856	7481116	Interesting, interesting.
7481576	7489058	So, what do you think, and I know you're not there anymore, so you can't really say one way or the other because you don't know, but what do you think the chances are we're going to see some kind of Extreme 2 next year?
7490358	7508981	Well, it's pretty safe to say, I mean, if it's a profitable franchise, you just keep milking it for what it's worth, and it's, I mean, the good thing about DDR is even though the gameplay is pretty basic, it's always progressive with its music, so the music will always drive sales and people to try new titles.
7509810	7511073	No, uh, oh, yeah, Loki.
7511734	7514721	Hopefully if there is an extreme too, they'll have the sense of humor to make it purple.
7516872	7517832	That would be very funny.
7517852	7521913	You've got to let Jason know that from Orange Launch Radio, that we want to make Extreme 2 purple.
7522633	7523734	If it happens, if it is Extreme 2.
7526374	7529615	Now, some interesting news that's been going around about Ultramix 2 is the song packs.
7529715	7532936	They did say on The Freak that there's going to be, what, 7 through 12, I think they said?
7533536	7534276	Yeah.
7534456	7537737	Maybe every month, every other month, we don't really know.
7537837	7542658	I'll just say I wouldn't be surprised if they space them out a little longer than once a month.
7543138	7543398	Okay.
7543996	7545477	Yeah.
7545497	7556444	From what I've seen, there's definitely some very interesting choices, like things that the hardcore B-Money people would be very... Oh, so you know about some of the stuff that's coming up.
7556704	7557725	Dude, I know everything.
7557985	7559005	Oh, sorry.
7560066	7560586	Watch out.
7561187	7561487	Alright.
7562908	7564249	Yeah.
7564309	7567330	Alright, anything else you want to share we should be looking forward to from the world of Konami?
7568551	7572694	It's kind of hard to say because, I mean, for all intents and purposes, everything's been...
7573564	7575605	Released out for this fall.
7576305	7583748	Probably the last game that's going to be pretty big for those who are into the RPGs and 4 will be coming out early January.
7584049	7584309	Cool.
7584389	7585549	I got to play a demo with that actually.
7585569	7586049	It was pretty fun.
7586610	7586830	Yeah.
7587010	7589671	I mean, the only cool thing is, you know, I'll get to see my writing in there.
7590631	7591332	Oh, very cool.
7591432	7597154	Yeah, because me and another guy had actually helped do some translation or like rewriting for that project itself.
7597494	7597795	Great.
7599056	7605777	Yeah, that's main stuff from Konami for now, I mean... Now, are you going to come back after Ultramix 2 is released?
7606544	7610705	Are you going to come back to the show and kind of, you know, fill us in on how this happened?
7610945	7613026	Because now, you know, all the information will be out there.
7613046	7615087	You get to tell us a little bit more about how it all happened?
7615347	7615927	Oh, definitely.
7615987	7621969	I mean, I'd be more than willing to, you know, come up here and talk about stories of, you know, like songs and like who got to do this.
7622049	7627711	I mean, you'll probably find out who did what steps and then like what caused us to think, you know, why we did that pattern and all that kind of stuff.
7627731	7630332	There are definitely some interesting stories and
7630612	7638358	You'd be surprised at some of the songs that people like on the V-Rays and stuff, but there were actually some testers who did not want to touch certain songs whatsoever.
7639239	7640840	Ooh, we're going to have to hear about that.
7640920	7645063	There's plenty of interesting gossip that will go down afterwards.
7645143	7649807	Now, if I'm not mistaken, though, there's still about half the song list we don't even know yet still.
7650027	7656152	Oh, yeah, there's some things that people don't know about, and there's a lot of funny things to...
7656983	7663248	Although it kind of sucked in a way that the VRare had more or less spoiled some of the things we wanted to keep really top secret.
7664449	7667832	You know what though, when you stopped giving clues, we had nothing to do.
7669273	7672636	And you know, GameStop employees can't be quiet to save their lives.
7674721	7678005	Are they ever going to tell us, give us more clues, give us a song list here?
7678745	7680247	Probably not, because we're only about 10 days out.
7680327	7681228	It just ain't happening.
7681388	7681928	You're no fun.
7682389	7682809	That's alright.
7683350	7697984	Actually, I mean, it's... Upper management has been really stressed out from Ultramix 2, just trying to basically get it in before... I mean, our target date was actually probably the second week, basically around the same time Halo 2 was supposed to come out.
7698004	7699485	You know, 11th we were looking at, but...
7699991	7703932	I know it got pushed back, but I mean, just kind of stuff happens in the business.
7704332	7709474	So, you know, and it's also interesting because we've heard that some things changed with Ultimix 2 as well.
7709494	7713755	Some song list changes happened, some things behind the scenes, so, you know, maybe they had to go back and do something else.
7713795	7719977	Yeah, I mean, it's not uncommon to have one song one minute, and then, like, a couple versions later, yeah, we decided not to have it.
7720117	7725198	I mean, people, you know, I think I mentioned one time about Dancing Stage Unleashed, you know, there was supposed to be
7726643	7732311	A certain song, which was actually slated for the USMAX 2, I think it was Grooves in the Heart.
7733373	7736718	It was supposed to be on USMAX 2, but just never made it for one reason or another.
7737339	7740624	I mean, of course, you're probably never going to hear from me about what songs didn't make it.
7741184	7745968	and it would actually, sad part is I do have one to tell, but it just breaks my heart to even think about it.
7746428	7747189	Oh, wow.
7747429	7748730	It was really good, folks.
7749191	7749591	Wow.
7749871	7754315	Oh, yeah, you got me all, you're going to have to, now, see you in a year, nobody will care, so you'll have to tell us in a year.
7754935	7757857	Unless someone shoots me up with some, like, sodium pentothal or something like that.
7758198	7758998	I think we can arrange that.
7759499	7760059	All right.
7760159	7761040	Well, thanks for coming by, Mel.
7761060	7762141	You're welcome back anytime, of course.
7762481	7762841	SILENTHILL4
7784145	7785186	Ooh, get your pens ready.
7785206	7789689	So we'll have like some kind of certain theme plotted out and then see what people can do with it.
7790510	7795733	And kind of off topic, my own personal plug, I'm going to be selling a Silent Hill 4 stand-up display.
7796154	7801738	If anyone wants it, I'll be putting it somewhere on some place and I'll sell it or whatever.
7801938	7805080	I'll probably post it on the LiveJournal Silent Hill forum.
7805921	7806421	Alright, very nice.
7806914	7810195	Shark Skrull, I didn't want to neglect you.
7810235	7812015	You're sitting there and you look kind of bored.
7812556	7813216	No, I'm kidding.
7813276	7814536	I just feel kind of hot.
7814956	7815896	It is kind of hot in here.
7816897	7819657	Any exciting plans for the next few weeks for you?
7822178	7825599	Try not to murder my fellow co-workers that I can't stand.
7826857	7828658	Try not to walk out on my job because I really need money.
7828698	7829158	That's about it.
7829358	7829698	Okay.
7829978	7830658	Well, I want to come down.
7830678	7832779	Now, we're going to have Dave and Buster's Play Day pretty soon.
7832939	7835180	And we can harass a new friend of mine who works there.
7835400	7836260	Yay, harassment.
7836520	7837541	Harassment is fun.
7837921	7839481	And what else am I going to ask you?
7839981	7840802	How's hockey going?
7841082	7841622	Oh, God.
7841642	7843423	Does it look like it might get better?
7843943	7844123	No.
7844863	7846123	They're being stupid morons.
7846163	7847204	The players are being idiots.
7847364	7856567	From what I hear from friends who actually have contacts in the upper level of Sharks management, the owners are willing to negotiate and work on it, and the players aren't.
7856994	7859436	They're saying, we want what we want, too damn bad.
7859596	7864560	So, from what I hear, the Sharks are planning that there won't be a season this year.
7864840	7867962	Which pisses me off, but it saves my wallet.
7868783	7869263	So, you know, hey.
7869283	7870024	I guess there's a bright side.
7870624	7872286	So, yeah, it could be all bad.
7872646	7877690	Well, if there is a season, like a partial season, like they ended up doing with baseball or something, hope your Sharks can win it.
7878090	7878851	Hey, we're undefeated.
7879891	7880472	Woo!
7881773	7882994	Nothing, nothing, we rule.
7883717	7884978	It's just like our match game tonight.
7885378	7888339	Are you guys sticking around?
7888559	7892381	Are you guys going to be taking off too?
7892421	7895543	I want to talk to Iguana Girl when we get back about a promotion she got recently.
7895563	7897284	I want to talk to her about what's going on with the Freak.
7897584	7899965	We'll talk about that when we get back.
7900005	7900986	We are going to take another break.
7901466	7902866	How about some more 2DX Red stuff?
7903487	7911851	Navi, as our resident whore who knows a little bit more about this stuff, why don't you pick some songs for us that you want our chat room to hear?
7914668	7915068	Uh, which one?
7915208	7915808	What's the, what?
7916048	7922470	Okay, we're going to hear Horizon, and what else do you want to hear?
7923191	7928492	We're going to hear Death Disco, Texture, I'm sorry, It's Lake with Texture.
7932754	7933554	Do do do do do do.
7934565	7935546	Wonder Bullfighter.
7935586	7937488	All right, we're going to hear this 2DX Red music.
7937848	7941872	And when we come back, we're going to talk to Iguana Girl and Islander a little bit.
7942112	7944074	And we've got to get the cage match and the FUs in.
7944094	7945976	We've only got less than an hour of show left.
7945996	7946857	We've got to squeeze this all in.
7947257	7948098	So we're going to do that.
7948698	7949239	Okay, wait.
7949279	7953283	My FU of the week is a two-hour drive to the Bay Area because, damn it, I want to stay here longer.
7953943	7955084	Aw, I'm sorry, hon.
7955124	7956746	You just have to take Monday off work sometime.
7957304	7960365	I'm seriously thinking about calling in tomorrow, but, you know, hey.
7960785	7966207	But then, you know, someday, someday we're going to bring the show over there to your neck of the woods.
7966267	7966967	We've got to someday.
7967587	7969508	So someday when we have a three-day weekend.
7969548	7971789	Floatwalk, any preemptive FUs you've got to get out for you?
7972529	7977390	Oh, man, well, I guess just FU2.
7978011	7982292	Just FU2, like, game companies putting out too many damn games and just, man.
7983280	7986441	basically for not giving me enough time to play everything.
7986781	7997006	Oh, and FU2, my new job, I was supposed to start Monday, but they said they couldn't start me until Wednesday, and whatever hurts my bank account really just makes you go FU.
7998406	7998866	I hear that.
7999407	8000407	All right, guys, thanks for coming.
8000427	8001387	We'll see you later, okay?
8001508	8002928	Oh, most definitely, the sooner the better.
8003008	8003488	Have a good one.
8003528	8003828	Here we go.
8003848	8004489	We're going to go to break.
8004509	8005029	We'll be back.
8005069	8006029	Show's not over yet, though.
8006570	8009291	I'm losing a couple people because I've got a long drive, but we've got plenty of show left.
8009331	8009751	We'll be back.
8076197	8077018	Thanks for watching!
8113028	8113892	Thanks for watching!
8226186	8226907	Thank you!
8374816	8376036	Orange Lounge Radio.
8376377	8378537	We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.
8384259	8386380	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
8386440	8387920	We gotta get to the cage.
8387960	8388861	Bye, Sharks Girl.
8388881	8389421	Bye, Foot Walk.
8389441	8389821	Have a good one.
8389941	8390381	Thanks for coming.
8391341	8397363	They got a long drive back, guys, so they're good sports for coming all the way down here to come on our show and eat Mongolian.
8399244	8403365	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
8429173	8430734	But that doesn't mean you replaced J-Dog.
8431354	8432475	No, no, no, no.
8432515	8440860	Basically, King of All Cosmos, aka Spike, has not been able to put the amount of time into the site that he would want to.
8440961	8444603	So he decided to step down and I was put into his place.
8444783	8450947	So now basically I'm helping out with the forums and keeping things hunky-dory on the forums and whatnot.
8451207	8452508	It's a hell of an undertaking, I bet.
8453072	8458734	Yeah, we've got a lot of projects that we're working on right now and trying to get squared away.
8458854	8465456	So yeah, it's a lot of stuff to do, but I've got such a wonderful crew that I'm working with.
8465496	8467676	I mean, everybody's just fabulous to work with.
8467836	8469177	Which includes our very own DarkSakura.
8469197	8469377	Yes.
8469637	8471259	As well as Islanders, next to you over there.
8471379	8473000	Yes, he's our staff member.
8473020	8475923	And several folks listening tonight, in fact, but judging from our chat.
8475983	8477544	So, hi you guys, thanks for listening tonight.
8477564	8479326	VX, JasonXV, and Sherlock.
8479366	8480527	Yes, of course, Jason.
8480867	8482909	I saw Sherlock blue in there earlier, so that's great.
8483069	8484010	Thank you guys for listening.
8485851	8490695	I know you probably can't say a whole lot, but anything exciting coming to The Freak in the near future you might look forward to?
8490715	8490755	Um...
8492697	8495057	Can't really say anything about it right now.
8495077	8495898	Okay, fine.
8496818	8503119	There's a lot of stuff that's really up in the air, but don't be surprised if you start seeing some changes around the site.
8503499	8505419	Ooh, that's always a good one to leave people with.
8505639	8506560	Yeah, yeah.
8506680	8508060	How did you get involved with that anyway?
8508120	8515141	Because, you know, I remember that you and I, we had our first DDR experience together at that regular convention.
8515161	8515841	Yes, October 2000, yeah.
8515961	8518922	And then about a year after that, we weren't talking to each other, and then suddenly...
8519642	8522584	Suddenly you were running up the corporate ladder, a DDR freak.
8522604	8523564	How did that happen?
8523584	8524085	What happened?
8524445	8547298	Well, I, you know, just through the site, I mean, back in the old boards, you know, the green boards, as we, you know, affectionately call them, I started to get to know some people, and Jamie and I were becoming really, really close friends, and what ended up happening was she introduced me to some other people, which introduced me to some other people, which ended up basically with...
8548078	8552579	I remember seeing the nomination thread and being so proud.
8577806	8579187	I don't even remember any of that.
8580448	8583190	I was surprised because it was out of the blue for me.
8583831	8584391	Well, good job.
8584832	8585932	Congratulations to you.
8585952	8588074	That was August 2001.
8588214	8594480	Out of curiosity, there have been several mods on DDR Freak that don't mod anymore.
8594840	8597782	How many of the mods that were there when you started are still there?
8598803	8599564	I know Jamie's one.
8600998	8601379	and so on.
8617968	8618869	Thank you for watching!
8645690	8648793	I can't think of too many people.
8660403	8662585	I'm trying to think.
8662605	8663025	J-Dog?
8663585	8667528	Well, J-Dog, he owns the site, so that doesn't really count.
8667628	8669509	Interesting, very interesting.
8670610	8671871	What else do I want to ask you?
8672111	8675974	Okay, now, just between you and me, because nobody listens to this show, okay?
8675994	8676274	Oh, okay.
8676894	8679936	Which forum is the biggest bitch to handle?
8681918	8684880	See, that's the funny thing, is everybody else... Yeah, see...
8686505	8691587	Mr. Islander is, you know, Coffee Gunner is Breath Random Chat, but I don't mind random chat.
8691707	8692607	Random chat's fun.
8692667	8693588	I like random chat.
8693908	8695689	I mean, it's like the evolution.
8695849	8698130	I do too, but I refuse to get involved in political discussions.
8698150	8699070	See, here's my problem.
8699750	8702751	My most hated forum would be DDR Chit Chat.
8703072	8703412	Amen.
8704312	8709115	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
8732671	8734432	How much do you play DDR anymore?
8734872	8735192	I don't.
8737113	8742256	Unless you count Thumb Thumb Revolution, I have not played DDR in 2004.
8743117	8745578	How many of those mods actually play DDR?
8745658	8746178	Quite a few.
8746619	8746879	Really?
8747419	8751441	Surprisingly enough, actually it's about a three-quarters split, I would imagine.
8751701	8753202	So here's the logical follow-up question.
8753282	8754443	If you don't play DDR anymore...
8755083	8755983	What the hell are you doing?
8756563	8757243	It's the community.
8757484	8757964	It's the community.
8758404	8761144	All of you dumb fucks out there, I love you to death.
8762125	8762585	I'm kidding.
8762705	8764405	You pissed me off, but I love you.
8764745	8765205	I love you.
8765245	8765605	Good night.
8765645	8766425	No, no, seriously.
8767766	8770886	That's what drew me to it to begin with.
8770946	8773387	It was just like Rocky for me.
8774007	8776868	I started out with Rocky because it seemed like it was fun.
8776908	8777568	I get to go dance.
8778648	8782452	and so on.
8782532	8790260	But what kept me there despite everything else was the community, the family that you grow from it.
8790460	8801751	And that's honestly been the best experience about DDR for me was the camaraderie that I've felt, you know, this big huge happy
8802645	8803005	I love it.
8833095	8837881	and oh my god, maybe Orange Lounge and DDR Freak Radio crossovers?
8839202	8839863	I didn't say that.
8841324	8847451	I didn't say it, but I'm neither going to confirm nor deny those reports.
8851172	8852073	We shall soon see.
8852133	8854095	It could be some interesting things happening this November.
8854735	8855076	We'll see.
8855216	8855676	Possibly.
8855876	8856257	Possibly.
8856457	8856757	All right.
8858318	8867226	Well, Islander, I don't want to leave you out of the fun because we're talking to a Gwana girl, but you were one of the first people on DDR Freak, weren't you?
8867506	8867727	Yes.
8868027	8871170	How did this whole damn phenomenon get started?
8872711	8877135	Well, story goes, there was a group of guys that I saw playing
8877694	8881217	DDR, you know, way back in the day at Milpitas Golf Land.
8881277	8882438	First time I ever saw this machine.
8883438	8886381	And I started noticing, I started seeing the same people over and over again.
8886501	8887261	Like, i.e.
8887301	8893986	Floatwalk, who was just here earlier, just left actually, J-Dog, Pokai Kenobi.
8894827	8896508	And we started talking to one another.
8898010	8900692	And we started seeing each other more and more and more.
8901292	8906396	Next thing I know, Jason comes up with a website
8906997	8908378	with a huge long URL.
8909559	8913203	It was something at Berkeley, EDU, and da-da-da-da-da-da.
8913763	8915605	Sad thing is, I remember that site.
8915625	8916205	You remember that?
8916325	8917666	It was horrible.
8917707	8921730	No, when I first used it, NS3, it was the NS3 site that we came on board with.
8921790	8922551	Yeah, the N3.net.
8922571	8923331	N3.net was next.
8924252	8929657	And it just kind of progressed from there, how quickly people caught on and how much people loved it.
8929857	8934001	I mean, it's really amazing how much the site has really grown.
8935546	8936126	It is amazing.
8936327	8939249	I mean, my God.
8939669	8940069	45,000 members.
8940650	8941350	How many hits a day?
8942771	8944773	I wouldn't even know what the stats are, to be honest.
8944833	8946174	But let me put it this way.
8946214	8957382	The reason why we can't keep the video section up is the sheer amount of bandwidth that is used would cost us probably a good $500 a month in hosting fees alone.
8958004	8958845	Now, I got a good idea.
8958945	8959325	At least.
8959405	8962368	You guys should do one of those Winamp TV things with streaming videos.
8962648	8963469	That would be kind of cute.
8963870	8964090	Maybe.
8965071	8965351	Possibly.
8965371	8967233	Just remember, I suggested it, okay?
8967273	8968314	I want my credit.
8969155	8979825	And a lot of people have suggested BitTorrent for it, but part of the problem with that is, A, we're talking about the common user here.
8980496	8982798	and a lot of common users aren't going to be able to figure out BitTorrent.
8983098	8984319	Yes, at least right now.
8984419	8985479	Yeah, at least for right now.
8985519	8989262	I mean, obviously, you know, things like IRC were foreign to people back in the day.
8989442	8993405	If you haven't guessed, DDR Freak has to cater to the lowest common denominator sometimes.
8993485	8994505	Yes, unfortunately.
8994625	8998628	As in, no, I'm going to be high school.
8998668	8999989	No naming names, DarkSakura.
9000329	9001130	I wasn't going to name names.
9001150	9002350	I was just going to say complete idiots.
9002470	9002971	Okay.
9003851	9006273	Or, you know, as she said, the newbies, which I actually love.
9007072	9012494	Some newbies are cute!
9012854	9020196	If you go to the site, I am still listed as the DDR Amstabor.
9020737	9031160	See, one of the things I loved to do way back when was I loved to go to various arcades, talk to people, get them interested, and I just loved going around meeting people
9031923	9032503	who played the game.
9032904	9039028	For example, when the Sacramento crew came down to the Bay Area and everybody hated us.
9039568	9040289	You remember that?
9040409	9042030	No, that was funny.
9042090	9043491	I just want to point this out.
9044032	9050917	We were the bastard children of the DDR community for the longest time and now she's the queen of the goddamn forum.
9051197	9052238	I just want to point that out.
9052738	9054179	That is hilarious to me.
9054519	9057081	Meanwhile, the people that chastised us are banned!
9058542	9059402	I remember Prestige!
9087239	9089022	Yes, yes, he was there too.
9089643	9090665	Wow, a lot of names.
9091145	9092007	And you were there?
9092688	9093549	And you were there?
9093569	9093649	Yeah.
9094130	9095172	And you were there?
9095673	9096214	Exactly.
9096815	9097115	All right.
9099339	9099499	Yeah.
9100080	9101301	He said I had big tits.
9102862	9103182	Alright.
9104103	9107385	I hate to kind of cut this short, but you guys are welcome back anytime.
9108245	9109566	You're actually welcome in this house again.
9110307	9111207	Oh my god!
9112048	9113129	You know, I'm just messing with you.
9113589	9115590	I love this, that we can just be candid about it.
9115630	9116170	It's funny.
9116311	9116871	Life's funny.
9117291	9118312	That's what it boils down to.
9118332	9119653	Yeah, things change.
9119813	9120073	Alright.
9120573	9124536	Now, don't you go anywhere, Navi, because I want to talk to you still, too, after we get the cage match.
9124556	9125336	We've got to get to the cage match.
9125356	9126777	We've only got like 30 minutes left in the show.
9127258	9127678	Oh my god.
9127698	9127798	Huh?
9129248	9131589	Did Jamie just say we skip FUs?
9131609	9134531	We should skip FUs so that next week I can do double FUs.
9135712	9136592	I don't know about that, Jamie.
9136772	9138733	Maybe we'll have to do a mini FU segment.
9138833	9140734	Everybody will have to think of one really good FU.
9140814	9141615	One really good FU.
9141695	9142875	And that goes for chat room, too.
9142895	9145877	You only get one really good FU tonight.
9146117	9149238	But in the meanwhile, we've got to, got to, got to get to tonight's cage match.
9149679	9152040	So I'm going to queue it up here.
9152200	9153881	And if you want to participate in tonight's cage match...
9154201	9161405	All you got to do is head on over to our chat room over at www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on chat.
9161445	9166067	So let's bring on the cage match music, Jamie's favorite song.
9167708	9168568	I vote for Holic.
9169629	9171170	You cannot vote for Holic.
9171810	9172690	I'm still voting for Holic.
9172771	9173371	I don't care.
9174732	9175092	All right.
9176913	9179114	Oh, your FU suggestion got FU'd, Jamie.
9181275	9181795	All right, anyway.
9181815	9183276	Yeah, well, F you, buddy.
9183516	9185057	All right, we'll see what happens.
9185077	9185657	We'll see what happens.
9185737	9186317	Anything's possible.
9186357	9188198	Let's see how fast we can get through this cage match.
9188238	9192399	Last week in the Orange Lounge cage match, it didn't happen because we weren't here, because we had Halloween.
9192439	9195640	So, for two weeks running, you have had my pick.
9195740	9198061	My pick was the winner of the Orange Lounge radio cage match.
9198521	9202082	It was a song by Ian Van Dow, which you know from Castle's Nurse.
9202182	9203623	Thanks for watching!
9230632	9235836	The whole guest here, we get to do our best Simon Cowell on all the songs that play, except for last week's, because we already did it last week.
9235876	9239599	So, alright, I'll shut up and play a clip of song number one.
9239759	9240779	It is last week's winner.
9240879	9242601	It's Reason by Ian Vandal.
9264839	9266180	Music, Music, Music
9320649	9323430	Are there things that I should know?
9324350	9327010	Will you stay or will you go?
9329051	9330211	Where is the love?
9340173	9343714	Okay, that was song number one, last week's winner, or two weeks ago's winner, I should say.
9343734	9348255	That was Ian Van Dow from the album Ace with Reason, some happy poppy trance music.
9348295	9349035	Jamie's favorite!
9351709	9352350	You gave that song an 8.
9352430	9353613	I just want to remind you.
9353713	9354014	Alright.
9354535	9354916	Yes, you did.
9355136	9355437	Alright.
9356539	9358764	Let's go on and we're going to go to Loki's pick for tonight.
9358804	9359906	Loki, what did you pick out tonight?
9361167	9364610	Well, I figured I'd get something really sweet for you guys.
9366511	9373956	Earlier in the show, you heard me mention MidiHead, basically the guy that did the really kick-ass remix of In Your Eyes.
9374297	9377359	And, well, I got another track from him.
9377479	9382883	You won't even find this on his website, because I asked him for it, and he was laying it up to send to me.
9382923	9384544	And your internet penis is humongous.
9384744	9385365	Yes, it is.
9386045	9392451	Anyways, this song is featured in one of the trailers, or not, I should say TV spots for Matrix Reloaded.
9393212	9397796	And the song is called, um, I don't know what it is, Speed Demon.
9398276	9402860	And it's by a group, or a guy called Monolithic, and guess who Monolithic is?
9402940	9405343	It's Middy Head, and he's the singer, and enjoy.
9405363	9409967	Alright, here it is, song number two tonight, Monolithic, Speed Demon, enjoy.
9469541	9470823	Thanks for watching!
9617213	9618054	Thanks for watching!
9696114	9698135	Okay, that was song number two in tonight's cage match.
9698155	9700495	That was Monolithic with Speed Demon.
9700535	9702436	We're going to go around and see what everybody thought of that one.
9702456	9707357	Keep in mind, we're all a little pooped right now, so I don't know how that may affect the scores, but let's see.
9707397	9708017	DarkSakura.
9709478	9711718	It's not bad.
9712679	9713359	It's not bad.
9714508	9718209	I'll give it a seven and a half.
9718670	9719490	Alright, seven and a half.
9719530	9720570	Let's see, Guana Girl.
9721571	9725892	Sounds like the type of stuff I actually used to listen to, so I'm probably going to give it about seven and a half also.
9726152	9727433	Alright, seven and a half from Guana Girl.
9727493	9727793	Islander.
9729494	9731354	Honestly, not my style, but I still enjoyed it anyway.
9731654	9732795	I'd probably still give it a seven.
9733215	9734095	Alright, good deal.
9734155	9734375	Navi.
9735616	9738277	The music was pretty good, but then the vocals kind of ruined it for me.
9738297	9741858	It sounded like Bad Underworld with the cowboy twang, so I give it a seven.
9742699	9743599	Arcadian.
9745390	9748751	Yeah, the background was good, but the guy's saying leave something to be desired.
9748871	9748751	6.5.
9750572	9753293	Um, I've always, I think MidiHead's a really talented guy.
9753513	9757335	Um, I prefer the In My Eyes remix over that, but it's got a good beat.
9757455	9760937	I think cut down a little bit, that would be like a fun little 2DX song or something.
9761537	9762617	Um, yeah, right.
9762637	9764658	2DX is going to come out here.
9764898	9767499	Um, so I give it like a 7.5 as well.
9767919	9768180	Why not?
9768220	9769100	I'll be trending.
9770321	9773682	It's better with the Matrix reloaded visuals with it.
9774184	9775124	But I still gave it a 9.
9775184	9776525	That's awesome.
9776565	9780647	Alright, remember, it doesn't matter what we think, it's all up to you guys.
9780667	9785469	You can choose between Ian Vandal, that song, and DarkSakura's song, which we're going to hear next.
9785509	9786549	DarkSakura, what is it?
9787550	9791912	Um, it's by someone named Vlad.
9792272	9794113	It's Supersonic Electronics.
9795493	9795613	Okay.
9795633	9801256	If anyone happens to be checking random chat on GDR Freaks, they'll know what I was talking about.
9802236	9804517	I'm a little concerned, but we'll see.
9804677	9808678	Alright, this is Vlad with Electronic Supersonic.
9808818	9809218	Enjoy.
9812399	9814880	Hey baby, wake up from your sleep.
9815260	9826944	We have arrived onto the future and the whole world is become... Electronic Supersonic Supersonic
9828033	9853989	Electronic Hey baby, ride with me away, we doesn't have much time My blue jeans is tight, so on to my love rocket climb Inside tank of fuel is not fuel, but love Above us, there is nothing above, but the stars above All systems gone, prepare for down count 5, 4, 3, 1
9856465	9858567	Fly away in my space rocket.
9859988	9862350	You no need put money in my pocket.
9864051	9865953	The door is closed, I just lock it.
9867974	9869996	I put my code plug in your socket.
9870376	9874800	The sun and sky is bright like fire.
9875300	9877362	You and me gets higher and higher.
9882944	9886307	The only thing can stop us is flat iron.
9889730	9893392	Hey, love crusader, I want to be your space invader.
9893693	9896595	For you I would descend the deepest moon crater.
9896995	9899337	I is more stronger than dark vapor.
9899677	9902219	Obey me, I is your new dictator.
9902560	9904501	For you is Venus, I am Mars.
9904782	9907524	With you I is more richer than all the stars.
9907844	9909625	Make a wishes on a shooting stars.
9909846	9911647	Then for you I will play on my cosmic power.
9914145	9917026	Ladies and gentlemen, fasten your belt seats.
9917426	9918906	We have commenced our descent.
9919487	9923708	I trust you enjoy this flight as much as you enjoy this accent.
9923808	9927009	Now, back on Earth, it's time for a down splash.
9927449	9930610	Into sea of eternal glory, my spaceship crash.
9931110	9934191	People have arrived to cheer me from near and far.
9934211	9939513	And as I float, I open door and shout, I am world's biggest warship.
9944173	9945056	Thanks for watching!
9970095	9971837	Long live Space Race.
9972477	9973278	Long live Movania.
9999201	10002323	I just cracked up when I first heard that, so I give it a 10.
10003443	10004123	Iguana Girl.
10006865	10008806	It's got a nice rhythm and you can dance to it.
10011407	10008806	9.
10011587	10011987	Islander.
10015089	10016249	I thoroughly enjoyed that.
10016349	10016930	What can I say?
10017030	10017250	It's a 10.
10019111	10019391	Navi.
10019935	10023682	It makes me giggle like when I heard heterosexuality by Army of Lovers.
10024183	10025946	It gets a 10 because it has to win.
10025966	10027890	Um, Arcadia.
10029292	10030154	Very funny.
10030975	10031536	I'll give it a 9.
10036717	10040158	DarkSakura, this is something I would expect from Loki, not from you.
10040758	10044499	But, based on the butt plug in my socket line, 10.
10046600	10046960	Loki.
10048180	10050041	And people wonder why Push got elected.
10052161	10052762	I guess a 1.
10053282	10058003	I'm sorry, it would be a better fortune cookie song than it would be a cage match song.
10058669	10059490	Ooh, somebody jealous.
10059650	10060271	Someone jealous?
10060471	10061352	Alright, let's see.
10061972	10064415	Let's recap and then you guys can place your votes.
10064455	10064895	Here we go.
10064995	10068819	Song number one you can vote for tonight is Ian Van Dow with Reason.
10077428	10082413	Song number two you can vote for tonight is Monolithic with Speed Demon.
10093846	10098107	and song number three you can vote for tonight is Zlod with Electronic Supersonic.
10107030	10109991	Alright, place vote now.
10110171	10113351	Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.
10113592	10117433	You don't have a lot of time tonight, guys, because we want to get into the FU segment pretty soon here.
10117833	10119053	So get those votes in now.
10119093	10119933	You've got like a minute.
10120033	10121034	So do it, do it, do it.
10121994	10122294	Do it!
10124121	10124641	Do it now!
10125301	10125602	All right.
10126482	10132944	While we go ahead and open up the Skype line, maybe some folks out there have some questions, want to speak to some of our guests that are left here in studio.
10132984	10136225	I don't know if anyone's going to actually call, but we'll see here.
10136845	10137666	We're going to take a... What?
10137966	10139066	I'm going to do a sim update.
10139666	10141267	Okay, Loki, what's going on in the sim world?
10144888	10152551	Okay, there's been updates to both the in-the-group skin, no one cares, and the DDR red skin, which is meh.
10153275	10159258	and also Step Mania, Release Candidate 2 came out.
10159378	10159878	Okay, that's it.
10161318	10161939	Nothing important.
10162499	10163019	Nothing to see here.
10163099	10163539	Move along.
10166140	10167041	Well, that was quick.
10167221	10167981	What can I say about that?
10169542	10170762	Let's see.
10171283	10179186	Well, I guess what we can do right now while I'm tallying cage match votes, Jamie, why don't you go ahead and plug some of those other shows that you can hear on our lovely station.
10179522	10181264	I'm sure there's people who would like to give it the plug.
10181484	10182745	I mean, oh, I'm sorry.
10183586	10187810	Tuesday night is my show, Pump Up the Volume, starts at 7 o'clock.
10188010	10188310	Yo!
10188370	10190973	I'm going to cut you off real fast because we just got a call on the Skype line.
10191934	10192574	Too bad!
10192934	10195096	We'll finish your plug, then we'll go to the Skype line.
10195437	10196057	Never mind, I'm done.
10196598	10196918	Fine.
10198019	10199180	Hi, you're on Orange Silence Radio.
10199200	10199520	Who's this?
10200021	10200521	Hey, what's up?
10200581	10201142	It's Sherlock.
10201362	10202063	Hi, Sherlock.
10202083	10202543	How are you?
10203184	10203524	Pat!
10203544	10204685	How's it going tonight?
10204805	10205126	Pat!
10207099	10207719	We are good.
10207779	10211142	We're pressed for time, but we're doing pretty well, all things considered.
10212683	10213663	What's on your mind, Shark?
10215004	10216365	I don't like the other two songs.
10217045	10219367	I think Ian Vandal is probably the winner here.
10220027	10220508	Really?
10220808	10224010	Now, see, I have a feeling that they're going to go for the funny one.
10225211	10226592	No, no, I just don't like it.
10226792	10228713	Was it not funny to you, or what was up with it?
10230262	10231903	No, I'm annoyed by German techno.
10231943	10233483	It's just that amusing.
10233783	10234463	Aren't we all?
10234883	10236184	Wouldn't the world be a better place?
10237124	10240505	The only German songs we should be listening to should be by Rammstein!
10240785	10242606	That's in Germany, alright?
10242746	10243706	Let it stay there.
10243906	10245247	Wasn't erotic from Germany?
10245267	10246587	I believe so.
10246767	10247367	Enough said.
10248788	10254309	Exactly, that's probably the only song that we should have heard from... No, because Rammstein is considered Eurodance.
10254329	10256370	The last time I checked, Germany wasn't in Europe.
10258086	10259226	Germany's not in Europe?
10262147	10263487	Okay, anyway.
10263607	10267008	Did you have a question for any of our guests that are here tonight?
10267048	10268128	We've got a guana girl.
10268529	10270669	Hey, you're a mod over on The Freak, right?
10271069	10271669	Yeah, I am.
10272830	10274190	How is it working for a guana girl?
10274210	10275990	Does she carry an iron fist or what?
10277151	10278791	Yeah, she keeps an iron fist pretty well.
10279151	10280572	She keeps a check on me all the time.
10280632	10281972	I know she's got an iron bra.
10283730	10287017	Hopefully you haven't had to deal with that yet, though.
10287057	10287898	Was it made in Taiwan?
10293431	10295171	Here comes Iguana Girl on the keyboard.
10296972	10299092	I think she's going to post a link to the Iron Bra.
10299552	10301473	If you haven't seen this, Sherlock, you've got to check it out.
10301593	10302013	It's amazing.
10302433	10302993	Oh, God.
10303753	10304914	I don't know if I want to see this.
10306094	10306694	It's pretty funny.
10306934	10311976	All right, I think we've got in all the votes for Cage Match, so if you don't mind, Sherlock, I'm going to sidetrack for a little bit here.
10312296	10314296	I'm going to announce the winner of tonight's Cage Match.
10314336	10314897	You guys ready?
10316397	10319678	First of all, what do you guys think won out of all those songs?
10321394	10324176	You're fucking ruining America, goddamn you people.
10324597	10325838	Alright, let's see.
10325858	10326318	Here we go.
10326839	10332403	Tonight's winner is... Vlad!
10333004	10334365	With electronic supersonic.
10334405	10335106	Sorry, Sherlock.
10336267	10337528	The tribe has spoken.
10338248	10344574	With almost, get this, get this, Sherlock, twice as many votes as songs one and two combined.
10347176	10348977	You people smoke crack, I swear.
10349138	10349418	Well...
10352026	10352726	What can we say?
10352807	10358409	I already told you we were the bastardous, cancerous sub-community here, and that vote speaks for itself.
10359010	10361791	Yeah, yeah, it seems like it.
10364092	10365273	Did you get a link to the picture there?
10365813	10366634	Yeah, I did.
10369415	10370875	I'd rather not look at it again.
10370915	10371575	Let me look.
10371595	10373036	I want to see if it actually works or not.
10373076	10373716	Let me put it.
10373776	10376436	If you're in our chat room there, over at OrangeLawrenceRadio.com, click on chat.
10376456	10376957	Yep, there it is.
10377437	10381657	It's Iguana Girl with the lovely white face in the iron bra.
10382798	10383318	Amazing.
10385118	10385698	That's great.
10385998	10386378	All right.
10386779	10391119	Anything else you want to state on your 15 seconds of fame here, Sherlock?
10393460	10398521	I'd say something, but then Iguana Girl will probably hate me for it, so I'm just going to... Oh, now we definitely want to hear it.
10400990	10403371	Let me guess, the internet is serious business, guys?
10403752	10405853	Yes, the internet is very serious business.
10406853	10407814	That's what I tell everyone.
10407834	10409315	Why does that taste rough, Iguana Girl?
10410115	10412937	Okay, I'm going to do a nice little shot on the camera right for you.
10413237	10413797	Okay, Chris?
10414658	10416939	Yeah.
10417439	10418560	Oh, she just banked her bottom.
10419621	10419821	Oh!
10421242	10421662	Wow.
10422202	10423163	Man.
10423263	10426445	It's only when Sherlock calls in do we get the bondage coming out on this show.
10426465	10426725	Thank you.
10427267	10429208	I guess we'll have to call in more often then, alright?
10429429	10431930	Alright, are you coming to E3 next year, Sherlock?
10432270	10433791	Um, I'm hoping so, yeah.
10434152	10434732	Yeah, I'll be there.
10435052	10437414	Uh, Iguana Girl says something about attacking you at E3.
10437634	10439335	Yeah, yeah, she's gonna attack me.
10440196	10441317	Oh, and dyeing your hair.
10442537	10444639	I talk about Mod of the Month when I'm not supposed to.
10445259	10446960	And then she hates me for it.
10447081	10449022	Now, you came in second place this month, didn't you?
10449182	10450043	Oh no, Iguana Girl did.
10450583	10451283	Yeah, she did.
10452424	10455907	So now that Jason's out of the picture, it's on for next month, isn't it?
10457679	10459821	I don't know, PMG came out of nowhere last time.
10460081	10461102	You know what?
10461162	10461942	It's anyone's game.
10462122	10464904	All I have to say is Orange Lawns Radio, we're plotting something.
10465325	10468347	We're getting involved this next time, so you guys look out.
10468487	10469028	You look out.
10469833	10470533	or we'll see what happens.
10470793	10471814	Alright, thanks for calling, Sherlock.
10471834	10472434	You have a great night.
10472834	10473734	We gotta finish up the show here.
10473934	10474774	Alright, thanks for calling.
10475155	10475355	Later.
10476915	10477195	Alright.
10477455	10478015	Well, that was fun.
10479076	10481656	I like hearing from new people once in a while, so that's good.
10482317	10485578	Alright, we've got to, got to, got to, got to get to the FUs of the week.
10485898	10492159	If you already sent me your FU of the week, I had to close it on accident because of the cage match voting.
10492559	10495400	So, you want to get those back into me right now.
10496000	10497201	In the meantime, we're gonna limit it
10498214	10498434	Anger.
10498454	10498594	Anger.
10528112	10535017	A big, massive, humongous FU to the cost of plane tickets into Gulfport, Mississippi and Mobile.
10535498	10537239	I couldn't find one into Mobile for less than $800.
10537279	10542583	And I couldn't find one into Gulfport for less than $500 at the time I needed to leave.
10543024	10546586	Yeah, I was on Travelocity trying to pick my time.
10546706	10551570	And I found one into New Orleans, but that means that my family's going to have to drive an extra hour and a half to come get me.
10552151	10557875	But at least I get to leave New Orleans at 5 in the afternoon, which means that I get to enjoy the French Quarter during the day.
10560049	10562031	but it's ridiculous.
10562972	10563613	Ridiculous!
10564174	10564855	Totally ridiculous.
10565896	10568299	Alright, moving on.
10568339	10568660	Here we go.
10569120	10569381	Loki.
10571997	10578740	Fuck you to my car, and mainly Ford, because they make shoddy cars, and my car is falling apart, and I don't know why.
10578800	10580841	I just bought it, like, what, six months ago?
10581542	10592727	Used, granted, but it only has, like, only, like, a thirty-some odd, you know, thousand miles on it, and already the brake system, I think, is going out, or the front part is going out, and guess what?
10593027	10595788	Oh, they have a class action lawsuit for that kind of stuff.
10596068	10596849	Shoddy breaks.
10597249	10597849	Yay!
10597929	10598470	Guess what?
10598670	10604872	But lucky for me, I was smart and bought the extended warranty, so it will only cost me $50 to fix.
10605193	10606293	Whatever the fuck's wrong.
10607093	10608474	So, ha!
10609134	10611395	But that's my guess right now.
10611876	10615057	Whether or not they fucking try to screw me out of that, that's another story.
10615717	10616318	For next week.
10624339	10632425	My FU this week goes out to Sprint, PTS, because I went over there today to get a brand new cell phone and found out they have shit for deals right now.
10632846	10638510	I figured, you know, I'd be able to get a good deal because I'm not under contract with them right now, but all their deals are pretty shitty.
10638551	10644776	In fact, the salesman, excellent salesman, told me to come back later because they'll probably be getting better deals around Christmas time.
10645276	10650941	Fuck you guys, I swear to God, I'm going over to T-Mobile where I can have a cell phone that Catherine Zeta-Jones endorses.
10653187	10669135	I'm going to be generic on this one because it kind of encompasses a couple of different sections, but a giant F you to people who can't seem to understand that when you're banned, you're fucking banned!
10670336	10678980	You're not supposed to come back, and if you do come back, don't whine and bitch and moan about the fact that you've been banned.
10679690	10680971	I'm going to give you some advice.
10681991	10688594	I realize that I don't have to do any banning or anything like that, so I don't want to deal with the same bullshit you do, but this is how I deal with it here on Orange Lounge, okay?
10688955	10690155	You just got to look them right in the eye.
10691096	10691536	FIRED!
10692336	10692936	That's what you got to do.
10693677	10701381	But there are those people out there that are banned from the show like years ago, and they still keep... Yes, we have banned some people.
10701421	10701801	I forgot.
10703379	10714263	But, yeah, really, really tired of people who think that they're being cute and make threats on certain other websites that they're going to attack certain websites.
10714924	10718545	And don't think that we're not going to catch wind of that.
10719225	10720586	Giant F muted those dumb shits.
10721406	10722367	I want to close watching you.
10722827	10723167	Be good.
10723807	10724147	Islander.
10724167	10725628	I have none.
10726690	10728011	Nothing?
10728251	10729352	F you to that, Islander!
10730432	10730952	That's alright.
10732133	10733974	You know what, Islander's just a nice guy, honestly.
10733994	10736796	If you have a chance to meet him in real life, he's honestly the nicest guy.
10737076	10742839	A wonderful contrast to me.
10742919	10743379	Wow.
10743880	10744240	I see.
10744420	10744720	Okay.
10744880	10745481	Makes sense.
10745561	10745821	Navi!
10746499	10747480	I actually have an FU.
10748101	10748601	Alright, what is it?
10749642	10756849	FU to people who stop talking to you for like three months, call you back because they miss you, make plans and then flake out on you, and disappear again!
10758831	10760172	Yeah, wonderful world.
10760453	10764316	Oh yes, and then in reference to her band thing, I got banned.
10765293	10766154	I don't know how.
10766574	10771797	I had a link to some sim files or something.
10772218	10773619	I checked back on it periodically.
10773939	10774799	It kept showing up.
10775580	10776641	You know, can't load the page.
10776861	10779462	Then the other day, it says, You are banned!
10779503	10779863	From what?
10779923	10780263	Freak?
10780343	10780683	Or where?
10780823	10785467	No, it was some guy who posted his keysounded 2DX BMS files.
10786007	10787608	And it was in his signature.
10787928	10789829	I got some of those a long time ago.
10790290	10791891	And he only has two people on there at once.
10792031	10792651	I remembered that.
10792951	10794152	I checked again like the other night.
10794212	10794853	It says, I'm banned.
10794913	10795173	I'm all,
10795953	10796933	That's odd.
10798214	10799594	F that.
10800394	10800834	Arcadian!
10802594	10803375	Lucky to lies.
10804775	10805455	Ooh, ouch.
10805575	10808516	Alright, let's check out what the chatroom has to say.
10809576	10810696	Start off with Zaku.
10811316	10814377	F you, oh boy, here we go, it's political, brace yourselves.
10815097	10824879	F you to the Jesus-lovin' gun-lovin' red state voters for electing that no-good excuse of a chimp of President George W. Bush to a second term in the words of a great pump-it-up song, Lazenka Save Us.
10826445	10827426	That was awfully punny.
10828767	10832709	Raichan, fuck to you to being one of the many that's sick.
10834430	10837112	Oh, I think she's saying fuck you to herself for being sick.
10837152	10837593	I'm not sure.
10838673	10839434	I missed that somehow.
10840995	10843397	Jazz says, F you to procrastination.
10843997	10844157	Ah!
10846499	10849581	Poto says, F you to laggy towns in MMOs.
10852763	10856866	MPQ says, F you to the arcade for being close the day I went there.
10859187	10863050	BlackDevilerX says, F you to those Asian files on the DDR Freak forums.
10863090	10864190	Those guys piss me off.
10868280	10870361	Any comment on that?
10870481	10874464	I'm sorry I cannot control the content of the idiot post.
10874844	10875244	Sorry.
10875484	10876965	I figured while you're here I would let you say that.
10877065	10877846	Oh my god.
10879406	10883129	Elmullet says, F you to Halo 2 and a type the game will never live up to.
10887011	10888972	Blue using Halo 2, that's all that matters.
10890475	10896139	And lastly, DDR Angel says, F you to my video card for suddenly not liking Final Fantasy XI again.
10896199	10897340	I wondered why I hadn't seen her on.
10897761	10899482	Grr, no Final Fantasy XI for me.
10899562	10900563	Hmm, birthday present maybe?
10900883	10901884	Yeah, I'll keep wishing.
10902464	10903085	Okay, done, bye.
10904046	10906047	And Jamie has some advice from the laundry room.
10906067	10906928	She's yelling back to the laundry room.
10907248	10907909	Play a real game.
10908649	10909570	Yeah, play a real game.
10911414	10911754	Fired!
10932157	10934438	V-Rares, and all that stuff to find out how great they actually are.
10934658	10934938	You know what?
10934978	10937619	November's just a busy month, and we'll have to carry over some stuff to next week.
10937919	10939780	You know you're welcome back here anytime, all you guys are.
10939800	10941260	Yeah, as long as I'm willing to drive here.
10941660	10942641	Yeah, in a little ways.
10942881	10943261	I agree.
10943321	10944061	It's kind of crazy.
10944121	10945962	But thank you, of course, for coming, as always.
10946502	10949063	And thank you guys, Iguana Girl and Islander.
10949103	10949763	Hope you had a good time.
10949863	10950463	Come back sometime.
10950984	10951764	Definitely.
10951944	10953905	And, you know, good luck with that radio station.
10954005	10954345	Grr.
10954465	10954845	No, I'm kidding.
10956378	10959060	It'll be interesting to see what happens in the next couple months or so.
10959700	10960221	Good luck to you guys.
10960801	10965043	And good luck with the moderation of those forums, huh?
10965504	10965884	Oh, yeah.
10966884	10968605	And Arcadian... Damn the man.
10969066	10969646	Save the empire.
10970286	10972968	Arcadian, big thanks to you as well for being here, as always.
10973848	10974069	Sure.
10975009	10976270	And try not to get pulled over tonight, please.
10977671	10978511	I'll try.
10979551	10981792	He's a bad boy outside of this show.
10981832	10983272	You would never guess it, but boy oh boy.
10983652	10983932	All right.
10984732	10988113	Now it's the part of the show where we go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
10988233	10990734	Just like Jerry Springer, we go around and get all the final thoughts.
10991054	10992334	Navi, your final thought for tonight.
10993294	10994334	I've run out of walls.
10997055	10998835	Iguana Girl, your final thought for tonight.
10999055	11000416	Butt plugs in socket.
11002756	11004297	Islander, your final thought for tonight.
11004837	11006137	Eat, drink, and be merry.
11007264	11007604	Very nice.
11007664	11009145	Arcadian, your final thought for tonight?
11011066	11011766	You see, I'm bad.
11011906	11012766	You don't know the half of it!
11012866	11013607	Ha ha ha!
11014087	11014447	Or maybe not.
11016468	11017068	No, can't have that.
11017928	11018849	Loki, your final thought?
11020389	11023030	I have the device done, now to haunt the house.
11025171	11025812	Jamie, quick!
11026092	11026672	Jamie, quick!
11026712	11027372	Your final thought?
11027953	11028933	I'll go, I'll go with mine.
11029233	11036276	My final thought is, Outside the Box moves to Thursday this week, so please don't forget to listen and fuck... Fuck Survivor and fuck The Apprentice!
11037515	11038435	DarkSakura, your final thought.
11038455	11039156	I have clean clothes.
11039176	11040316	They smell like gain.
11052392	11052712	Lovely.
11053633	11054273	One last thing.
11054413	11056874	The final word of the show.
11057475	11059036	One word that sums it all up.
11059416	11060717	We'll give it to Iguana Girl tonight.
11060757	11061817	Tonight's final word.
11061857	11063278	Thank you very much, everybody, for listening.
11063298	11063838	Have a great night.
11063858	11068881	We'll see you next week where we're going to interview Conception and talk all much more about all these Bomani stuff.
11068961	11069441	Final word.
11070342	11070762	Boobies.
11072230	11077093	That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.
11077933	11082135	Orange Lounge Radio Live is an Orange Lounge Radio production.
11082635	11090399	For more information about our station, visit our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com.
11090940	11094902	And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.
11129039	11129660	Thanks for watching!
11162280	11163245	Back to him that night
11187813	11198025	Christmas trees, decorate the house with lights at night Snow's on the ground, snow white so bright In the fireplace is the Yule log Beneath the mistletoe, F.E.J.
11198185	11198666	eggnog
11221215	11223217	Merry Christmas and Happy New Year
11276869	11280380	Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
11296897	11300278	Orange Lounge Radio Afterbirth, the part after we fade to black.
11300318	11303699	Hopefully you guys know to stick around because there's always something fun after the credits.
11304299	11306480	Tonight, my God, we are so pooped though.
11306660	11308060	I mean, it's just been a hell of a show.
11308881	11310281	What a way to come back after not being here.
11312602	11314342	I do, I need to talk about ratings though.
11314962	11316283	I need to talk about ratings for the station.
11316723	11317223	Rating, what?
11319545	11323548	Ratings for the station have fallen 20% in the past two weeks.
11325329	11327371	I am quite disappointed in you guys, that's alright.
11327951	11334676	But here's your chance, go in your little player window right now, vote us a 5 that you love this station, you want to listen to it every day, and then do so.
11335136	11336357	And help our ratings get back up.
11336377	11340280	Now we realize, okay, we were off for a week, we had some repeats in there.
11340900	11344502	and you know, we had some shows, switch days and stuff.
11344822	11346002	No more excuses, we're done.
11346022	11351145	Okay, so you gotta whore us up so that we can be the number one internet radio station of all time.
11351225	11352105	That is the ultimate goal.
11353186	11353426	Jamie.
11355427	11356067	Yes, we do love you.
11357248	11357708	That's right.
11358948	11363950	I'm hoping that with the Akira contest, we'll be able to get back up in there and some other things.
11364050	11365831	Now, you guys know I'm just teasing.
11365871	11371113	I mean, I can't expect you guys to listen all the time, but it would make me a happy boy.
11372894	11378637	Anyway, I also want to talk quickly about The Incredibles, that movie, because I'm surprised you didn't say much about it, Loki.
11378837	11379557	What did you think of the movie?
11381798	11384659	It is what all superhero movies should aspire to.
11385280	11385980	It is actually...
11387023	11393627	It's very misleading, like anyone that's seen the previous, because they think, oh, it's a kids movie, oh, this and that.
11393927	11400110	But actually, it has a story that I would say is on par, if not better, than a lot of the animated Superman and
11400886	11428531	Batman series and we know that those are awesome writers on those series and of course the guy that wrote the whole damn thing the guy behind the Iron Giant that movie was incredible this movie is literally the set design the character development everything is just excellent you need to see this movie I cannot stress that enough it is awesome, I cannot wait for a sequel
11429847	11430928	Thanks for watching!
11452185	11453966	Did you see his movie yet, Navi?
11453986	11454126	At all?
11454146	11454386	I have not.
11454407	11455447	The last movie I saw was The Grudge.
11455467	11456188	What did you think of that?
11481334	11489102	I liked it a lot, and a lot of people that have seen it either said they liked it and thought it was really scary and then other people said that movie had absolutely no substance whatsoever, it was crap.
11489952	11494855	I liked it, I thought it, I mean, it was more something like, wow, it was actually a scary movie.
11494935	11499458	We don't see very many scary movies very often anymore, at least that's what I thought.
11499618	11505222	Yeah, for the record, I did not get to see the Star Wars 3 trailer when I saw The Incredibles, just for whoever asked.
11505702	11512187	I don't really care, I'm not like the hugest Star Wars fan in the world, I mean, you know, hooray, the movie's coming out, but, you know, I'll be okay.
11512947	11516409	Anyway, I like the grudge as well, except for the audience I saw it with.
11516449	11517489	Yeah, you should have been the mom.
11517509	11520011	You should, like, compare audiences later.
11520671	11521231	Seriously.
11522092	11522412	All right.
11523032	11524893	Well, okay, that's going to do it for the afterbirth, you guys.
11524913	11525713	We've got to take off.
11525773	11529815	Jamie's got to get home, and I got tests to grade and stuff like that.
11529856	11532037	So thank you guys for listening, though, so much.
11532157	11534538	We really do appreciate the fact that you guys support this station.
11535058	11539222	Through our high points and our low points, we are working on so many exciting things for you guys.
11539502	11541024	We're teaming up with Spot.
11541284	11542886	We're teaming up with Freak.
11543146	11545148	It's amazing, the stuff that's in the future for us.
11546189	11553596	I really thank you guys who have supported us, especially those from day one, but we definitely welcome all you guys that hop on board as the show goes on.
11553616	11554196	It's just amazing.
11554216	11554477	It's amazing.
11554497	11554897	It's amazing.
11557738	11558538	I don't think it's on, Jamie.
11558738	11559959	Remember, do it for the ferrets.
11560059	11560239	Yes.
11560339	11561019	They love you too.
11561799	11562960	Let's hear a little ferret love there.
11563800	11564660	Get a little ferret love.
11566101	11566941	Even, you know what?
11567681	11569021	Loki, we don't get enough.
11570522	11572562	We don't get enough love out of Loki on this show.
11572702	11575203	Loki, will you please let the listeners know how much you love them?
11577984	11578284	Uh, no.
11581642	11583883	Alright, enjoy the post show tonight.
11583963	11585184	You guys can probably figure this one out.
11585224	11588085	We definitely have to load you down with some 2DX Red music.
11588666	11594888	So enjoy, have a great night, and we'll see you tomorrow night for Diversion at 7 o'clock for Monty Remixes.
11594928	11595669	Have a great night, guys!
11712918	11716125	When I got the older baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

12768257	12769998	You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
12770018	12775319	We're live here with this post show going on of 2DX11 style, also known as 2DX Red Music.
12775399	12778760	I guess it's taboo to call it 2DX11 style.
12778780	12779681	I'm not supposed to say that.
12779701	12783402	I might get bitch slapped by some rabid fan.
12783662	12789084	But actually what I'm going to do right now is I'm actually going to do something technical on this end that has to do with the archive of the broadcast.
12790164	12793607	The past few weeks we've been having trouble with it, though, and it stopped the station.
12793687	12797989	So if you guys get booted from the stream, it's going to go back to the Bomani Music and More program.
12798009	12804373	So just restart the stream in like 15 seconds if we disconnect, okay?
12804614	12805194	I'm going to try it now.
12805214	12807736	I'm going to hope we don't, though, so I can keep going with the 2DX Red stuff.
12807756	12808176	Here we go.
12808256	12809257	Let's see what happens.
12809797	12811158	If I lose you guys, then good night.
12811378	12811558	Sorry.
