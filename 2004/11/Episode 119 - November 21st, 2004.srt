00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:18,760
He's weak.

4
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,260
You're already on the line.

5
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:27,260
This mommy talks radio like so much boring.

6
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,760
Oh, God.

7
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,260

Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.

11
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:52,760
Orange Lounge makes me plenty of muh-uh-muh-trap-muh-cocky.

12
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:56,760
Just kidding, Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that.

13
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,760
In this episode...

14
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,760

You're tuned in to the B-Money Scene's most interesting station of all things, Baloney.

21
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,760
Actually, I should have been the internet's radio station.

22
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,760
You'd think I'd have my script memorized by now.

23
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,760
I'm out of it.

24
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,760
You've got to turn it on.

25
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,760
Turn it on.

26
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,760
The butt money.

27
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,760
Butt money?

28
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,760
My name is Rob Roberts.

29
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,760
You might know me better as Sky.

30
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,760
Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts.

31
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,760
In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm.

32
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,760
Say hello to Miss Jamie Summers.

33
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,760
You know her better as Dark Sakura.

34
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,760
I have food.

35
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,760
And that's yummy.

36
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,760
What kind of food?

37
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,760
I have a low carb copia with roast beef and provolone cheese and spinach.

38
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:23,760
Her mic is really, really low. Can we do anything to turn off her mic over here?

39
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,760
We'll have to look into it. Alright.

40
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,760
I said that I'm fabulous and wonderful and the world should worship me.

41
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,760
As always. Tell us something new.

42
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,760
I have food.

43
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,760
Okay.

44
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,760
And it's better than all of your food.

45
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:46,760
Also joining us tonight, earning his title right now, trying to fix Jamie's mic there, Techmasa Loki.

46
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,760
Hi.

47
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,760
Alright.

48
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,760
And he can't say anything else because he's too busy working.

49
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,760
Also joining us tonight in studio, a familiar special guest. He's here an awful lot.

50
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,760
Say hello to Arcadian42.

51
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,760
Hello.

52
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,760
And, uh, wow. That's it. It's just us tonight.

53
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,360
A couple back-to-back weeks of really big shows with a lot of people here, but tonight...

54
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,960
They all abandoned us.

55
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,760
Nah, tonight we were forgotten about... No, it's fine.

56
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:21,460
We're going back to just feeling the love of the people who are here every single week,

57
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:24,160
or in, you know, Arcadia's case, damn near every single week.

58
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,960
And a mouthful of spinach.

59
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,560
You're louder now, though. That's good.

60
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,760
And I have spinach.

61
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,960
Call that love.

62
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:32,760
Alright.

63
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,160
Tonight, pretty big show. We actually have a lot of music tonight.

64
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,160
Well, probably the talking is probably going to be a little bit less

65
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,120
I mean, of course, we still got a lot to say so we're gonna be doing a lot of talking about one

66
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,120
I want to warn you guys got a lot of music

67
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,240
We got a lot of music for you guys tonight as well because we have

68
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:57,240
An exclusive for you guys the new ultra mix 2 songs. I'm not talking about the same stuff that was on the v-rare

69
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,920
We already played that I'm talking about the brand new songs from ultra mix 2

70
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:05,520
that isn't anywhere else on the internet yet and for instance in this first break

71
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,120
we're gonna hear of ten Goku or point five nine both both you know the song

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:23,040
whole lot of new ultra mix 2 songs ultra mix 2 is on everyone's mind this weekend

75
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,280
I think if you're a DDR player you've you've heard about this game and if

76
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,680
you're an Xbox owner you probably own this game by now or you're getting it

77
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,880
very soon and then of course on top of that we've got all the Japanese imports

78
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,880
as well so a lot of big news tonight we'll get to all that after this break

79
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:44,840

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,560

82
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,360
lust after his musical talent there you go there's the Jamie I know all right

83
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,360
And I lust after his body.

84
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:07,360
Oh my god! Tonight is the night of Revelations!

85
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,360
And that was just funny.

86
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,360
Loki lusts after a man.

87
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,360
No. No, I don't.

88
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,360
Maybe that's in the same way I lust after, like, Margaret Jones.

89
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,360
You mean he's not a giant robot?

90
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,360
In the same way I lust after...

91
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,360
I don't know.

92
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,360
I lust after Teriyaki Saw.

93
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,360
Yes, oh, Benihana Teriyaki saw it, so yeah, less after that.

94
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,360
Okay, yeah, sorry, break time!

95
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:38,360
We'll be right back after this. Music from Ultramix 2. Enjoy, you guys.

96
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:45,360
She loves the voices in her mind They tell her, don't you believe

97
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:55,360
She's tired of smiling at me A little bit sadder as it comes back inside of me

98
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,360
You know it ain't for me

99
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,360
Cause you're watching the same inside

100
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,360
No good to give, no meaning to leave

101
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,360
No missing from the night

102
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,360
Everything I've known

103
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:33,360
I'm the one expecting everything I know

104
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:17,480
Hi ho, Kermit the Frog here informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

105
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:26,920
is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

106
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:33,240
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio episode number 119 on this lovely November 21, 2004.

107
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,680
First off, to those of you guys that are brand new to the station, tuning in for the first

108
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,080
time, big welcome to you guys, welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.

109
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:44,200
I know that our rebroadcasts that are starting now over on DDR Freak on Friday nights are

110
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,760
getting a pretty good reception, so I think we might get some new people because of that.

111
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:53,480
So a big thank you to you guys for tuning in over here and listening to the live experience.

112
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,240
Certainly check out our website if you haven't yet, orangeloungeradio.com, because there's

113
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,620
all sorts of ways you can interact live with our show on Sunday nights.

114
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:03,400
And of course, a really big thank you to the folks at DDR Freak who've also been syndicating

115
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:07,800
our show, allowing those folks who can't listen to the show on Sunday night get a chance to

116
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,360
listen and definitely support internet radio.

117
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,520
And together, we can destroy crappy commercial radio.

118
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,400
With a shotgun?

119
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,440
With a BFG, for all I care.

120
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,440
A pretty gun.

121
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:26,600
Anyway, in there we had some songs from Ultramix 2, brand new, playing them for the first time.

122
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:31,120
Loki and I just were recording those off our Xbox not too long ago, hope you guys enjoyed

123
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,120
it.

124
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,720
I'm giving you guys something to check out tonight.

125
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,640
Those of you guys especially who haven't gotten a chance to check out Ultra Mix 2, fabulous

126
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,760
fabulous game, which we'll talk about a little more in detail later, but first I want to

127
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,760
get your guys' thoughts.

128
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,200
What did you guys think of those songs?

129
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,520
Jamie, I know you had some pretty strong thoughts on Tengoku Remix.

130
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,000
Okay, the Tengoku one was ass.

131
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It was utter.

132
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,440
Okay, they take a song that was perfect the way it was, and added a bunch of extraneous

133
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,640
crap that had no business being there.

134
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:59,260
You know what's interesting is that a lot of that same feedback in the chat room, I'm

135
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:05,920
seeing a lot of Ziz says it just sucks that they killed Tengoku with this remix, MPQ says

136
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:11,260
too much kid, not enough, Tengoku, or.59 however you want to say it.

137
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:17,900
It's just, it really was a lot of extraneous stuff that really didn't need to be there.

138
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:21,300
You know what though, I'll admit, I actually kind of like it. It's like one of my more

139
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:25,380
favorite remixes. It's different and I can see why people don't like it because it is

140
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:28,500
so different than the original and a lot of people consider the original to be

141
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,220
like one of the

142
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:32,740
staple Bamani songs. I mean, honestly, it's in like every

143
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:36,580
home 2DX version. Well, not every, but almost damn near every. And then, you know, it was a

144
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,900
classic DDR song.

145
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:41,140
So it's kind of like when somebody touches that and makes it different, people are kind of

146
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:41,620
nervous.

147
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:45,780
I kind of dug it, though. Certainly more so than a lot of those

148
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:50,140
remixes we got on previous DDR mixes. It's the same thing like what they did with the

149
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,260
Battle Royale manga.

150
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:55,140
They took something that was fine the way it was and blew it way out of the

151
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:58,960
way out of proportion by Americanizing the text too much. I think they Americanize the

152
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:08,360
mixing too much in this. It sucks. It's too big, you know? It was fine, simple, the way

153
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,360
it was.

154
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,840
Well, to each their own opinion, but certainly UltraMix 2 offers something for everyone,

155
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:17,960
so even if you didn't really like that song, maybe you liked After All by Delirium. I would

156
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,960
hope that you would like that song, Jamie, considering it was a former cage match pick

157
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:27,840
yours here on Orange Lounge Radio. I think she likes that song. Not a whole lot of reception

158
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:31,620
from the chat room on that one, but of course we had known about that song for a little

159
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:36,220
while now, so that's nothing new, but it gave guys a chance there to check out the new edit

160
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:41,180
there of After All. And then a brand new song called Altitude, which we were hearing for

161
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:46,140
the first time on the show here by a group, Cause & Conception. Definitely a really different

162
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:49,580
sort of track for DDR. Definitely a kind of song you haven't really heard in DDR a whole

163
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:54,380
lot before. What did you guys think of that? I like that song. It's pretty cool. Yeah,

164
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:59,460
I like it too. It's just different and it really works for DDR because you know there's

165
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:03,820
those kids that love those speed ups and slow downs and that song's got all that fun stuff

166
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:09,340
in it. I kind of like the drum and bass sound to it a lot too. Which interestingly enough

167
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:12,380
brings up another topic. We were actually supposed to have Conception on the show I

168
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:16,440
think last week, but unfortunately, I don't know what happened. We just kind of got out

169
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,800
touch and I wasn't able to contact him last Sunday but we'll try to get him

170
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,200
back on the show at a later date I know he still wants to do the show so we'll

171
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,720
see we can do because I want to ask him about how does it feel to have a song in

172
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:34,320
DDR Loki that seems like okay put down the dating sim on the DS for a minute

173
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,640
what do you think altitude that seems like the kind of song you would put in a

174
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,800
cage match I don't know what you think altitude I liked it it was cool yeah

175
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,160
different have you played that one on all to mix to you I think once yeah it's

176
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,240
it's different it's kinda cool because a lot of people are going oh my god

177
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,840
finally we're getting like a US exclusive song that's a nine footer

178
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:55,920
of course not only is there a nine there's like ten US exclusives right now too

179
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,320
what are you doing over there on the DS you look like you're scratching off paint or

180
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,480
something with your stylus

181
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,520
it's all black

182
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:07,780
oh you're doing picto chat and you're just making all black boxes

183
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,520
lovely

184
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,960
yes of course today the twenty first being the release of the DS as well and

185
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:17,820
And not only Loki, but myself had to go pick up one of these, and...

186
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,240
I heard they were supposed to be in short supply, but I don't know, it doesn't seem

187
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,720
like there was much of a problem finding...

188
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,720
It wasn't that hard to find.

189
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,720
It wasn't that hard to find.

190
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,720
We found it.

191
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,720
You guys have DS's?

192
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,720
Yeah, let me get one in the back.

193
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,720
Well, that was difficult.

194
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,720
Alright.

195
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,780
I don't want to get too far off base here, because we have to start off the show as we

196
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,280
start off every week's show.

197
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,920
Did we want to talk, since we brought up Conception?

198
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,920
A little later.

199
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,920
We'll do that later.

200
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,920
Okay.

201
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,920
Anyways.

202
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,560
We have to get to how was your week, how was your day, because that's an Orange Laundry

203
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,560
of tradition, dammit.

204
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:49,760
So, Jamie, I know you're working over there, but how was your week, how was your day?

205
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,760
My week was shit.

206
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,680
Oh, I'm sorry.

207
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:56,280
My day was half shit.

208
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:01,800
I normally enjoy being female.

209
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,420
This is one of the days I don't.

210
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,040
I think I know where this is going, okay?

211
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,140
I'm not going to say anything else.

212
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:11,440
I've been in a crappy, crappy mood all day.

213
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:19,920
I overslept, and then it took quite a bit for me to be happy again today, so I am now

214
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:30,860
in a better mood than I've been all day, thanks to the power of good conversation, and coffee,

215
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,080
and salty food.

216
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,700
I normally hate salty food.

217
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,300
I went out and got me some hot dogs.

218
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:45,900
were salty hot dogs from the 7-11. Oh, 7-11. Are they big wieners? Are they fat wieners?

219
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:53,460
They were big fat wieners and they were so hot. Okay. What kind of sauce do you enjoy

220
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:58,300
on your wiener? I don't put sauce on my wiener. You like your wieners raw. I like it plain.

221
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:04,980
Raw. She eats her wieners raw. Awesome. But, no, the rest of the week was kind of okay.

222
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:09,820
I've been mostly gearing up toward my trip to Alabama because I'm not going to be here

223
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:17,180
next week because I'm going to be in Alabama and not here, although I will have my laptop

224
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:23,860
with me and there may be some Skype potential if I can find a reliable broadband.

225
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:24,860
That's next week's show?

226
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:25,860
You're not going to be here?

227
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:26,860
Yeah.

228
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:27,860
Okay.

229
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:28,860
I'm sort of going to be in another state.

230
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:29,860
Yeah, I know.

231
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:30,860
I know.

232
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:31,860
That happened to me once this year.

233
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:34,780
I'm going to come back with a fro because I cut my hair short and the humidity is going

234
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:37,960
to make it all poof up. It's gonna be funny.

235
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:43,100
Are you gonna come back with a little bit of Southern accent? I thought I already had a good one.

236
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:47,140
It's not that strong though. I never really had much of one to begin with.

237
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,280
But um...

238
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:53,100
And now today, during the show, I'm gonna be kinda quiet because I'm doing a paper on

239
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:57,140
a focus on ethics for business law. You, ethics?

240
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:01,860
Okay, you can shut up right now, okay? I'm just teasing. I have ethics.

241
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,860
I have... some.

242
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:38,860
me and my fucked up morals. But nah, I'm gonna, it's gonna be cool because I'm gonna go see

243
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:46,260
my mama's son, and I'm gonna see a bunch of my friends, and actually a few people from

244
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,580
DDR Freak are gonna be coming down to see me.

245
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:52,300
Yay, Freak!

246
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:56,740
And I figure maybe I'll get some interviews or something, or a statement from various

247
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:57,500
peoples.

248
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:01,740
Please do, we do want some statements on record from some of our pals in Alabama.

249
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:04,020
and the surrounding areas

250
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,260
so uh... that's pretty much uh...

251
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,540
pretty much it

252
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,940
yeah

253
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:09,880
sounds good to me

254
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,940
uh... let's go to

255
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:15,580
excuse me, let's go over to... you'll have to excuse me guys, I have a cough tonight

256
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,960
and we're not um...

257
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,060
since we are basically run out of our

258
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:19,960
our living room

259
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,740
uh... we don't have like a cough button like real radio stations do

260
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,540
so if I cough like right into the microphone

261
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:28,380
yeah, seriously like if you go to real radio they have these cough buttons which basically mute

262
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:31,100
your speaker real fast if you think you're going to cough

263
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,100
Yeah, like a mute button on the phone.

264
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:38,100
I prefer to call those make fun of the customer buttons.

265
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,100
See, unfortunately we don't have make fun of the listener buttons.

266
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,100
So, you know, we don't have that. We can't afford cough buttons.

267
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:48,100
So if I just cough in your ear and blow out your speaker, my apologies, but I'm sick.

268
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:53,100
I totally agree with you, Rob. Click. Those listeners are stupid. Click.

269
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:56,100
Oh, wait. Just kidding.

270
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,100
Click. Shut up. We get a dollar for everyone that listens. Click.

271
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,100
Just kidding, I wish.

272
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,100
Alright, Loki, how was your week? How was your day?

273
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:05,100
Um, my week was alright. It was pretty uneventful.

274
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:10,100
I tried playing Grand Theft Auto my style, which includes cheating,

275
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:17,100
and, um, my GameShark 2 crapped out on me, so I bought a new, um, code breaker today.

276
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,100
Cheaters never prosper!

277
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,100
No, she-

278
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,100
Oh, yeah, we do!

279
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,100
Shitty software-

280
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:25,100
Oh, what do you mean, cheaters never prosper? Bush got elected!

281
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:38,360
Anyways, anyways, um, so, anyways, so, um, today we got the DS, which is a lot of fun,

282
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:46,720
and, um, yeah, it, it, we basically started off using the DS in a very mature fashion,

283
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:52,120
chatting with each other via text in a chat room, literally six feet away.

284
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,120
Yes.

285
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,120
From each other.

286
00:22:54,120 --> 00:23:00,120
He was sitting on the couch, which you can see on cam, and I was sitting in the Jamie's seat, which you can't see on cam, but it's really close.

287
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,120
On the other side of the coffee table.

288
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:13,120
We were playing PictoChat and writing dirty words like vagina and things on the PictoChat and drawing middle fingers to each other and stuff, and it was hilarious. This is what the DS was made for.

289
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:18,120
I love the DS just for that. That is the best feature right there.

290
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:23,600
Well, I actually it was really cool because we were playing a metroid prime hunters at

291
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,800
The you know the demo at Best Buy and I got to see the control on it's awesome. It's just

292
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:36,200
Really smart. I'm having issues with it. It's too much for me. I miss my Atari joystick

293
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:40,220
Okay, one button one button for everything now. I like it

294
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:40,780
I like it

295
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:44,460
But it cramps up my hand like a bitch because you have to hold it in a really weird way

296
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:50,460
And so, like, my finger's all fucked up from trying to reach around to the back to, you know, push the, uh, L button.

297
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,460
And it's just like-

298
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,460
Sounds dirty.

299
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:56,460
Can't quite get the reach around, huh?

300
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:02,460
I guess, yeah, whatever. Anyways, um, so, other than that, um...

301
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:06,460
I don't know, what else did I do? Oh, we went to Benny Hoffs today and that rocked.

302
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,460
rocked

303
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:10,860
cuz we we're gonna go some like uh... cheapo uh...

304
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:14,380
teriyaki whole place in the end of not being

305
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:16,780
open on a restaurant's closed on sunday

306
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:19,780
religious restaurant particularly

307
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:22,540
seriously i don't take place close on sunday they don't have to play here

308
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,340
though

309
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,900
have one of the line

310
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:30,740
that's why you're going to get sick play in alabama okay

311
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:31,660
anyway

312
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:35,080
uh... so yeah i want to go to south sack any two pop eyes

313
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,360
dodgeball. I could eat five Popeyes in Mobile.

314
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,520
Sorry, Logie.

315
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:44,040
Yeah, sorry. But not really.

316
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,540
So anyways, so yeah,

317
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:49,240
it's pretty much a lot of Final Fantasy.

318
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,940
I've leveled my White Mage up

319
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,520
five levels or so.

320
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,920
Addict.

321
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:59,060
And um...

322
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,460
What else?

323
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:03,000
Not really much else other than that. I mean, we got

324
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,240
you know, Ultramix 2, so I watch people play that.

325
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:11,080
And that's pretty much it for right now, yeah.

326
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:16,760
I think so. Alright. RTDN 42, how was your week, how was your day?

327
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:21,840
Eh, my week was kinda eh. I was sick most of the week with a cold, but

328
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,280
working. Wasn't that bad. It was just sniffly all week, and

329
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:29,920
so forth. Hit the work. Then,

330
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:35,040
went on Tuesday when I got my smog test for my car, so I can get full registration.

331
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:39,440
Then, after doing that on Thursday, I went down to the courthouse to see if I could pay

332
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:44,040
off my ticket for the registration thing, hopefully.

333
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:48,460
Oh yes, and that was the one you got after this show a couple of weeks ago, yes, alright.

334
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:53,080
But he said that I need the final registration, or have to go to DMV or something, so they

335
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:57,800
extended the date, so I have that until the next month to get all that done.

336
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:04,800
They'll let me correct it and only have to pay 10 bucks to $191, which would be a bitch if I had to do that.

337
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:11,800
Then I paid some 2DX this week and ordered 8th Style on Wednesday.

338
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,800
You're going to get 8th Style before me cry?

339
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,800
Yeah, well it's probably going to be like two weeks or so, I don't know.

340
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,800
Because I ordered from YesAsia and they don't have any stock at the moment.

341
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:25,800
I definitely want to play some of the 8th Style consumer stuff tonight because there's a song on there I love so much.

342
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,200
I'm going to be getting mine from Playasia.

343
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,200
Everybody's getting 8th Style but me crying.

344
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,200
I'm supposed to be getting it for Christmas.

345
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,200
And I still don't have 7th Style crying.

346
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,200
Well, it's either 8th Style or I think I'm getting a tablet.

347
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:40,200
Because I'm changing my major to an R major.

348
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,200
Okay.

349
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,200
See, didn't do much else.

350
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,200
Played a bit more 2DX today.

351
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,200
Came here yesterday and played UltraMix and that was pretty cool.

352
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,200
Yes, thanks to you guys that tuned in to the 20 November special yesterday.

353
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,200
You rock.

354
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,200
We're going to talk about that later.

355
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,700
Sure. We are going to talk about it later. I'll talk about it then.

356
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,700
Yeah, we'll talk a little more about Ultramix 2 later.

357
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,700
Okay. And, that much else. That's good.

358
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,700
Yes, Loki.

359
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:11,700
I forgot to mention, I watched the second greatest show to come to Spike TV.

360
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,700
It would be, Hey, Spring of Trivia.

361
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:21,200
Spike TV is the most intelligent station I've ever seen because they are bringing...

362
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,360
You said spike TV and intelligent in the same sentence.

363
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,800
Listen, they have a good video game award show, and they're bringing Japanese game shows

364
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,000
over here to America.

365
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,720
And reruns of Blind Date 24 hours a day.

366
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,720
Exactly!

367
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,720
That fucking rocks!

368
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,720
And you know what else they have?

369
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,280
World's wildest police chases, and we watch that every fucking day.

370
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,600
And that's awesome.

371
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,960
So they have really kick-ass TV.

372
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,040
But hey, Spring of Trivia, it's the weirdest show you'll ever see.

373
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,040
It's just a trivia show.

374
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:56,080
really game show, and the winners at the end, they win bread.

375
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:03,960
Sounds like one of our giveaways. And it's great though, because one of the trivia things

376
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:10,760
was, Mozart wrote a song called Lick My Ass, and he actually did write a song called Lick

377
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:15,600
My Ass, and then they performed the song Lick My Ass, which was translated into English,

378
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:21,600
It was great. It was like, um, you know, wonderful sensation. Lick my ass.

379
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:28,600
It was great. You just have to watch that show. It's great.

380
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:39,600
You know what? Having taken quite a bit of music history when I first started college, because I started off as a music major, that doesn't surprise me one single bit.

381
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,880
You know what? Box said it right though.

382
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,160
Lick my ass is a wonderful sensation.

383
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,160
No, not... Mozart. Mozart.

384
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,800
Mozart in my mind. Whoever! The dead guy!

385
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:58,120
You know, that's what, see talking is now, you know, take that song

386
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:01,840
and you know, put it into like another Renaissance song

387
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:06,200
for like, you know, 2DX Blue or whatever the next one's gonna be.

388
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:10,120
Gold. Anyways, 2DXT, yellow.

389
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:14,180
Oh, and one more, one more thing. This will be the last thing. I went and played Derby

390
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:20,180
Owners Club, finally, at Golf Land. And, and I made my horse, I EAT CHILDREN.

391
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:24,220
That is the best name of a horse ever.

392
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:27,600
I heard that Derby Owners Club is actually really popular at Rosso Golf Land, right now.

393
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,660
Dude, the techs there play it.

394
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:33,280
And I heard that Milpitas Golf Land got lots of angry phone calls.

395
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,380
Oh, yes.

396
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:39,140
For once we have the cool game on the block, actually we had Disney's Rave too for a while

397
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:41,740
there, but for twice we have the cool game on the block.

398
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:44,240
I really, really hope they can keep it in good shape this time.

399
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,260
I gave poop to a small child.

400
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:48,780
Well the coin slots are a little iffy.

401
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:49,780
Wait, wait, wait.

402
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,340
How did you give poop to a small child?

403
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:55,780
I bred some of Iguana Girl's horses because I missed having my specials.

404
00:29:55,780 --> 00:30:01,180
The first one I built was an albino so I named it Shiroi as a female.

405
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:04,500
If it was a male I would have named it Michael Jackson or something because I think its parent

406
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:11,220
was Latoya Jackson. And no, it was one of her half and halves. Anyway, my second one

407
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:17,540
came out all gray. So I named him Poop. And I gave him to a small child. And then my last

408
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:24,220
one was a panda, so I named it Ganguro. Here, have some poop, little child. Oh, you should

409
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:27,740
have seen the kid. I was like, here, I named my horse Poop. You can have him. And the kid

410
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:39,500
I just grinned. I got poop! He just had that, heh heh heh grin. Can you imagine the parents

411
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:48,260
getting the phone call? Could you tell your child not to bring poop to school again? Sorry.

412
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:52,500
But yeah, we got a stardom young in the life of horse racing, and you know, betting on

413
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:59,460
tracks anyways I'm then go baby go explicit joined us during that first

414
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:03,380
commercial break and you know he's always got a lot to say what's up how

415
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:07,220
was your week how was your day oh very good had to take how to take like a few

416
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:12,060
tests to this week passed off practically passed all of them and I

417
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:17,340
actually finally played Derby's ownership club at RVGL go baby go go

418
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:23,340
Yo, baby, yo! And it's about time our video got onto my good side.

419
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:27,340
I still haven't gone there yet. I'm still a little scared.

420
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:31,340
That place... Bemani Games go and they die there. I'm scared that when I go there,

421
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:35,340
Derby Owners Club is going to have like two monitors missing. This is going to make me cry.

422
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:39,340
More kids stealing the... More kids breaking all the TV.

423
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:42,340
Seriously. Graffiti or something, I don't know.

424
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:45,340
Oh, and finally got the DS.

425
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:49,340
Yeah, the pictogram can online.

426
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:55,340
Were you here when we were talking about how Loki and I were sitting just six feet from each other, writing vagina, and sending middle finger pictures back and forth?

427
00:31:55,340 --> 00:32:01,340
I just got here. And I'm hiding right now with my fuck you hat.

428
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:11,340
You have to put that on cam so they can see. Cam over at www.orangesonitrader.com. If you can't see the hat that Xplizit is wearing, it says fuck you in sign language. It's pretty nice.

429
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:18,940
Yeah, right now I have metric point hunters. It feels pretty good so far. It's just hard

430
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:19,940
to get used to, really.

431
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:22,820
Are you having problems with the reach around like Loki is?

432
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,940
Not really. I actually got used to it very quickly.

433
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:25,940
Okay.

434
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:33,740
I can shoot. It's just shooting is the big problem. That's the only thing. That is all.

435
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:41,060
Sorry. Does everything have to be about gay sex, really?

436
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,060
Yes.

437
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:49,580
You're making me think D.S. stands for dual sexuality.

438
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:56,660
I thought D.S. stood for me. Fuck y'all.

439
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,500
Okay.

440
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:02,500
I have no other real material tonight, so I resort to Dick Fart and gay sex jokes. I'm

441
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,000
I'm sorry you guys.

442
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,820
Yeah, how does it feel to have a- I'm offended, I need to sue.

443
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:07,940
How does it-

444
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:11,100
Go ahead, you ain't gonna get blood out of a turnip, honey.

445
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:14,940
Oh, you mean the DS? Oh, I thought you meant me, my dick and fart and gay sex jokes. No.

446
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:19,980
I'm offended! How does it feel to have a game system named after you?

447
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:26,800
My ego is gargantuan, like the size of the King of All Cosmoses package.

448
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,080
I have decided, by the way, speaking of that,

449
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:34,840
that I'm going to cosplay as the little prince, with a big ball of stuff.

450
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,840
I should cosplay as the king, that would rock.

451
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,060
You know, actually I forgot I did do something else yesterday.

452
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,560
I went to the Rekacon kick-off.

453
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,340
Oh, how was that?

454
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:44,000
It was pretty good.

455
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:51,940
What is Rekacon, for those who don't live in California? It's a local anime con, one of the smaller ones at one of the schools in Pittsburgh, California.

456
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:56,440
It was pretty cool, I had a good time. I want to go again this year. They moved the date, though, didn't they?

457
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,380
March, I think.

458
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:03,620
But, um, I got a, like, a Phantasy Star Online art book, and I picked up a record, which

459
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:07,900
I need to bring over here to rip the audio from, because it's all a bunch of old, like,

460
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:14,260
late 70s, early 80s anime, like Galaxy Express and Yamato, and Lupin the Third. It's pretty

461
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,260
cool.

462
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:17,500
Are you on staff over there now?

463
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,700
I'm supposed to be, but...

464
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,220
See who you can talk to about a...

465
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:22,740
I'm programming a database for them.

466
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:27,740
I'll see what you can do about a live Ask Orange Lounge chat thing, because I've always

467
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:31,780
wanted to do, you know how they have the anime cons? They have the, you know, the rooms with,

468
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:37,020
you know, the ask the person questions about costuming, ask the voice over actor questions.

469
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:42,980
I want to do Ask Orange Lounge Live. I'll talk to him. Alright, cool. But I, I just,

470
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:45,860
you know, seeing all the costumes, I was like, you know what, actually I should do. And someone

471
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:51,300
suggested, by the way, I got a free copy of The Sims 2, which I'm giving to Iguana Girl.

472
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:58,980
But I'm going to be, he gave me some ideas for a skit I can do for the masquerade.

473
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:02,780
And that would be put little, you know, Lego houses and stuff on the ground and roll over

474
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:03,780
it with a giant ball.

475
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:08,620
They have, like, this big display behind me that's these legs in this humongous package.

476
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:10,760
Awesome.

477
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:15,180
You know if they do put Katamari Damacy on the DS, the king will have to be, like, both

478
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,180
screens.

479
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,020
His package will take up the entire lower screen.

480
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,020
That would be awesome.

481
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:28,020
Although I'm wondering how one so endowed could come out with something so tiny.

482
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:33,020
I should be getting my game, the Japanese version in a day or two.

483
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:36,020
I got off eBay for about the same price as they cost me.

484
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,020
Oh, so you bought the Japanese version?

485
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,020
Yeah.

486
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,020
Oh, very cool.

487
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:43,020
Of course, they didn't change much, except the words, but hey.

488
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:46,020
Alright, my week and my day was pretty good.

489
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:49,220
I didn't do a whole lot of Bomani playing, well except for Ultramix too, I've actually

490
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:52,380
done a lot of DDR playing in the past three days, but I'll get into that a little bit

491
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,380
later.

492
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:57,340
I did not go out to Rosewood Golf Land with the others on what, like Wednesday or something?

493
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:00,420
I don't know, I was supposed to go on a date the other night and I got ditched, so you

494
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,780
know, life sucks sometimes, but what can you do?

495
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:06,060
Although I got an apology today, so that made me feel a little better.

496
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:11,040
And one of my really really good friends is in the hospital for the second time this week,

497
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,300
so Christopher, I know you're not listening, but I'm thinking about you and I hope you

498
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:21,140
feel better soon also got went and got the DS with Matt today and I've been

499
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:24,940
really enjoying that as well and Benny Hana is one thing that Loki didn't say

500
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:27,580
about Benny Hana that was only my second time there but you know what's really

501
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:30,580
weird about when you go to Benny Hana when you go to most restaurants you sit

502
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:33,900
at your own table right but at Benny Hana you kind of have to like share a

503
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:37,220
table with other people because they sit like seven or eight people at the table

504
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:41,180
because of the fact they only have so many chefs and so we got to share the

505
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:44,700
table with this lesbian couple and their child it was so cute because the little

506
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:49,020
baby was calling both of them mom and just made me happy you know I like

507
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:54,760
seeing gay people you know that you know have kids and stuff anyway so I guess

508
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:58,180
that's pretty much it for my week of my day not a not a whole lot exciting stuff

509
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:04,300
to report at least that I can think of right now anyway so of course we want to

510
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:07,740
talk a whole lot about Ultramix too we want to get your input over the

511
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:13,460
Skypline, if you go over to www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on interact with us, we're gonna take

512
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:16,900
some of your calls in a little bit, but first let's go to a break, we still have a lot of

513
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:19,860
music going on to play for you guys tonight, as I said earlier in the show, we've got so

514
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:24,200
many UltraMix 2 songs we want to debut for you guys tonight, I don't think anybody else

515
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:29,460
has these right now, so we're playing them for you guys, and getting your thoughts on

516
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:33,540
it as well over the Skypline, and we'll talk about UltraMix 2 when we come back from this,

517
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:40,540
listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

518
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,540
You know she's got everything

519
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:08,540
That a woman needs

520
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:10,540
To get a man

521
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:11,540
Yeah, yeah

522
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,540
How can she lose

523
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:15,540
When she's with you?

524
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:17,540
Thirty-six, twenty-four

525
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:18,540
Thirty-six

526
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,540
What a winning hand

527
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:22,540
She's a brat

528
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:24,540
How?

529
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:27,540
She's mighty, mighty

530
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:29,540
Just letting it all hang out

531
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,540
She's a brat

532
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:32,540
How?

533
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:38,540
Yeah, she's the one, the only one, built like a knucklehead's arm, yeah

534
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:55,540
I said good-bye, I said good-bye, I said good-bye, I said good-bye, I said good-bye, I said good-bye now

535
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:59,540
Break House

536
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:02,540
Yeah, she's a knife in my tack

537
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,540
I just didn't at all hang out

538
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:08,540
Break House

539
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:10,540
Oh, that lady's back

540
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:11,540
That's a fact

541
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:12,540
Ain't holdin' nothin' back

542
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:13,540
I don't give up

543
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:18,540
He's out from the race house, yeah

544
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:43,900
Let me tell you something you don't know

545
00:39:43,900 --> 00:40:11,900
Let me tell you somethin' you don't know Let me tell you somethin' you don't know

546
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:26,900
Let me tell you something you don't know

547
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:40,900
If you keep these secrets I will show

548
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,900
I'm gonna make it

549
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:57,900
Orange Lounge Radio. We put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.

550
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:01,660
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio. Hope you enjoyed some of the music there in that

551
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:06,900
break. All from Ultramix 2. We had a song, you should know this one, Brick House by the

552
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:10,820
Commodore is finally making its way into a DDR game, that's a great one.

553
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:14,500
After that was a group called Creo with a song called Burning For You, which is kind

554
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:17,020
of a, I think it's one of the sleeper hits in the mix, honestly.

555
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:18,020
It's one of those songs...

556
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:19,280
Burn For You.

557
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,000
It burns in your ears, like, after you hear it, but in a good way.

558
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,460
I really like this song, it's like one of my, like, top three favorite songs in the

559
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:26,460
mix, I think.

560
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:28,800
I don't know, there's so many, I love all the poppy songs in the mix.

561
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,960
I love them.

562
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,240
Love them so much.

563
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:37,480
And after that was Catch It by Total Science, which is a song I don't particularly care

564
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,640
for so much.

565
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:44,000
And Dark Sakura is discovering the wonders of PictoChat with Loki on the DS right now.

566
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
What are you guys drawing pictures of?

567
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,120
My artwork is pretty damn good on this thing.

568
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,660
I want to put it up on the cam.

569
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:50,200
You can try, but it looks really blurry.

570
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:54,240
I can go try to put it up on the cam, but you're going to have to chat while I do it.

571
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,240
Okay.

572
00:43:55,240 --> 00:44:00,120
You need to...

573
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:02,120
I drew a picture of a toilet.

574
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,120
You can barely see it.

575
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:09,120
Yeah, you can barely see it, but it's coming out okay.

576
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:12,120
Look, he sent me a picture of a turd.

577
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,120
And I sent him a picture of my horse.

578
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:18,120
And he sent me a picture of glue, and I sent him a picture of a toilet.

579
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,120
Here, take that thing, take that foul thing back.

580
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,120
I'm supposed to be doing my homework.

581
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:32,120
I was going to say, I found a way to distract DarkSakra from her homework, show her PictoChat.

582
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:38,120
And now Loki is repeatedly sending me pictures of him holding a gun, shooting RVGL children.

583
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:43,120
That's like the third one he sent. Alright, I'm turning this off. We've got a show to do.

584
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:51,120
I'm really scared about the next, like, anime con, or better yet, DDR tournament, with all these DS's.

585
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:55,520
There's going to be like, every kid on the block is going to have their DS there and

586
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,760
drawing naughty pictures back and forth.

587
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:03,340
Did you like how there's a big old warning in the DS manual about parents, you should

588
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:10,880
advise your children if they're under 15 about the warnings of chatting with strangers.

589
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:16,800
When picking a name, make sure it's gender of, what was it, gender neutral.

590
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,520
I didn't understand the reasoning behind that.

591
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:19,520
I guess that's so that.

592
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,520
Dirty old man can't pick up on you.

593
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:22,520
With a DS.

594
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:26,520
Seriously, if you're a dirty old man hitting on girls on a DS, you're sad.

595
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:29,520
Desperation.

596
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,520
Let's see, here it is.

597
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:33,520
This is on page 10 of the manual.

598
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,520
Important privacy information.

599
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:40,520
Nintendo DS wireless communication, including PictoChat, is not monitored.

600
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:42,520
In other words, they're saying this is not Xbox.

601
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:46,520
This means PictoChat does not block messages from strangers.

602
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:48,520
Similar to unmonitored internet chat rooms,

603
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:51,840
children should be warned about receiving messages from or communicating

604
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:57,400
with strangers. Up to 15 other DS users within range of your Nintendo DS may be

605
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:00,760
able to view your nickname and messages within a selected chat room at any one

606
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:04,480
time. I hope to God because we live in an apartment complex so there's four

607
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:10,440
more buildings around here. There's kids over there, and they got video games. Mommy, mommy,

608
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:22,920
gimme PicnoChat, gimme DS. Oh, I can't wait. Oh, hey, who's this chatting on here? Penis.

609
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:27,640
And it goes on to say, an adult should assist children with a system setup and instruct

610
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:32,280
them not to use personal information and not meet strangers. Okay, that's the part I don't

611
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:36,320
get because how far does the DS work like it's only like 30 feet so chances

612
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:41,040
are you're already by the stringer but not necessarily because 30 feet and I

613
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:45,560
think that you can ping off of each other I think that would be something

614
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:51,760
else yeah or give personal information to anyone because it could be read by a

615
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:55,880
stranger so don't put your credit card number on pictochat okay well okay yeah

616
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:59,960
okay 15 year olds don't put your credit card number your social security on a

617
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:04,640
picked up chat you know wait wait wait wait I'm gonna let me be the first one

618
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:11,560
to say this right now okay you're gonna see an article within I'm gonna give it

619
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:16,600
like three months kids cut in school using the DS's to cheat on tests

620
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:19,480
seriously you know what they could already do it though is cell phone text

621
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:23,960
messaging I've already heard of that one in fact even because it's not a huge

622
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:27,720
secret I'm a teacher in my day job except I teach adults and adults are

623
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:33,000
just as bad as children but they use email they'll use their email system to

624
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:38,680
email each other during tests I have to watch them it's sad not everybody it's

625
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:42,840
I'm talking about one or two bad apples spoiling the bunch obviously exactly

626
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:47,080
whatever date you choose to enter is your month or day of birth year is not

627
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:51,960
asked for and it's your birthday message will be communicated in the chat room on

628
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:59,920
that date. For more information, visit nintendo.com slash consumer slash dsprivacy. That's some

629
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,840
good reading if you're ever really...

630
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:06,640
I love how the little warning comes up every time you turn that on. Be sure to look into

631
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:11,040
the health risks while playing the DS.

632
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:16,400
DS causes cancer. No, I don't know. Anyway, back to the big Bomani news from this week.

633
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:22,480
Ultramix 2, DDR Ultramix 2, hitting the Xbox. I know a lot of us have gotten a chance to

634
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:27,680
play it on yesterday, 20 November, during the special, and some of us have been playing

635
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:31,440
it throughout the weekend. Loki, what'd you think of Ultramix 2 overall?

636
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:38,640
It was good. It was definitely a good mix of, you know, basically it's almost all new

637
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:44,960
stuff anyways. And they did a really good job on it, really good job putting it together.

638
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:53,960
I was under the impression that there'd be more actual videos for these songs, like, you know, not this random shit, but eh, it's okay.

639
00:48:55,960 --> 00:49:07,960
But the steps seemed pretty good. Really, I didn't have any complaints about it, except maybe bomb mode was kind of stupid.

640
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:23,960
Some of the extra party stuff is kind of, eh, whatever. It's different. That's pretty much all it is, yeah. I like it so far, though.

641
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:24,960
What about Songlist?

642
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:35,960
Songlist was very good. I like all this stuff that you haven't heard before, like the new remixes and stuff from Different Drum. Very good decision there.

643
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:42,120
Whoever decided to hook up with a different drum for the songs bless you bless your little heart a million times over

644
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:44,120
That was the most genius idea for DDR

645
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:50,640
Seriously, that was as good as the original idea to hook up with Toshiba EMI in Japan for dance mania

646
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:55,960
And I know I've said it on this show before that all DDR needed was to hook up with another record label

647
00:49:55,960 --> 00:50:00,220
Just like Toshiba EMI in Japan hook up with a record label here and get some good songs and thank God

648
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:03,800
Somebody finally listened. Of course. I know they probably weren't really listening to me

649
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:08,800
me, but somebody else thought of the idea, and hooray, it had great effects on DDR. I

650
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:15,120
think the different drum stuff is the best music in the game. Anyway, Arkadian, what

651
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:20,320
are your thoughts on UltraMix 2 being a DDR, mostly import, fanatic, but how do you like

652
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,320
this domestic release?

653
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:26,320
Yeah, it was pretty good. I would definitely say it was probably the best US mix that I've

654
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:29,520
I've seen. Yeah, probably is the best US mix.

655
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:32,020
Yeah, a lot of cool new stuff.

656
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:37,020
Actually, I saw on some of the videos for the new stuff, they have, like, the website of the people.

657
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:38,420
Some people that did them.

658
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:40,020
And a lot of this stuff is pretty good.

659
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:42,920
I'd want to actually check out the bands that did them.

660
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:46,320
Which I'm sure if any bands ever heard that, they'd be very happy to hear that.

661
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:49,120
You know, having their songs in DDR gets them the extra exposure.

662
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:52,320
I mean, honestly, never heard Echo Image.

663
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:54,620
Never heard of them before they were in UltraMix 2.

664
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:58,240
And now I am a huge fan of them. I know most of the people that do this show

665
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:02,320
I know we've gotten tons of listeners in on that band. I mean, it's great

666
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:05,720
I mean, it's been great promotion for not just them but the other bands, too

667
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:09,180
I know there's a lot of day behavior fans and stuff too. So but

668
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:11,720
anyway

669
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,480
Yes, Jamie

670
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:15,760
Nothing. I just don't think the sentence makes sense. Oh

671
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:23,760
It was Mr. Sucker's contention that this violated the implied warranty of merchantability.

672
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,760
Does that sound correct?

673
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,760
It's big words, but it sounds fine to me.

674
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:32,760
I didn't mean to interrupt the Vimani discussion. I just had an agonizing moment over my own grammar.

675
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:34,760
Have you gotten a chance to play Ultramix 2 at all?

676
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:37,760
No. I haven't had a chance to do anything.

677
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:41,760
You'll have a chance before next week's show, hopefully.

678
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:48,360
Well, I'm hoping to get some time and, um, of course, um, it's probably going to be after

679
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:49,360
I get back from Aladamma.

680
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:50,360
Gotcha.

681
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:53,360
But, I've had other priorities.

682
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:54,360
Fair enough.

683
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:55,840
Balmani can't always come first.

684
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:57,240
Well, it could.

685
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:02,760
I left work early on Friday and ran over to GameCrazy to try and find the game and all

686
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:03,760
they had was the bundles.

687
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:04,760
Hiss!

688
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:05,760
Hiss!

689
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,160
All they had were the bundles, so I went over to Gamestop instead.

690
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:08,160
Good.

691
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,160
Go to Gamestop first.

692
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:10,160
You make me cry.

693
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,160
It's just the GameStop people are always hounding me.

694
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,160
Then go to the one of our Danvers!

695
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,160
It's too far of a drive!

696
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,160
Well then tell me and I'll go.

697
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:19,160
Fine.

698
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:20,160
Okay.

699
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:21,160
Alright.

700
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:24,160
I'm crying!

701
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,160
No you're not. No you're not.

702
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:29,160
Anything else you want to say about UltraMix 2 Arcadian?

703
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:31,160
Yeah, and the backgrounds are seizureific.

704
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:37,160
And if you play it for like over an hour or so, you'll start to get a headache if you have those on.

705
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:40,680
because I know I was after playing like two hours

706
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:45,200
to play a bit more after we left, my head was starting to hurt.

707
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:50,120
It helped to have these classes that are not the best.

708
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:55,340
I disagree actually. I think in the past three days I've played more

709
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:59,720
DDR than I have since I like first got into the game or like I would say after

710
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,320
fourth mix was new in arcades.

711
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:05,520
Huh?

712
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,520
Oh no, I have that 7-up sub.

713
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,520
Um, sorry about that.

714
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:15,520
I've played more DDR in the past three days than I have since I first probably played fourth or fifth mix, honestly.

715
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,520
That's how much I'm into this mix.

716
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:23,520
And I haven't had a seizure yet, but I agree that the backgrounds are really bright and it makes sudden mode very difficult.

717
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,520
I had a seizure yesterday.

718
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:26,520
What?

719
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:27,520
I'm kidding.

720
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:32,720
seem to try to throw as much shit on the screen as possible so you'll screw up and miss the

721
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:37,340
arrows. Like, you'll lose an arrow in all the busyness of the screen.

722
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:42,800
And in challenge mode, that can be a bitch. You can turn the videos off, people.

723
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:49,800
I know, but it's not as much fun that way. What was up with rage? First off, having ginormous

724
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:56,560
hair, and second, dancing like a fucking woman. Well, it did in fourth mix.

725
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:58,560
He had Emmys dances!

726
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:31,600
what Loki oh the tournament we did on 20 November yeah unfortunately not a whole

727
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:37,720
lot of people on Xbox Live just yet we tried doing a big tournament on Xbox

728
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:42,400
Live yesterday and we managed to finally get four people a four-person tournament

729
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:45,840
it was awesome but here's my advice to you guys that played the tournaments on

730
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:49,840
Xbox Live change the song or else you'll play the whole song the whole tournament

731
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:53,320
it was get it all we ended up playing get it all through the whole tournament

732
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:56,640
which is kinda nice because in a way was kinda funny because

733
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:00,460
you usually don't play the song pack games on live that much but

734
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:04,720
I don't know I think with the new lobby system Ultramix 2 changed the whole

735
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:08,940
live interface where you have the lobby now and you go back to the lobby once

736
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:10,200
you finish the game it just

737
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:13,580
just doesn't end the game and everybody goes off their own direction so I think having

738
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:17,020
that lobby allows you to see if people have song packs and stuff and it's much

739
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:17,720
easier for

740
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:21,980
getting to play some of those songs on Xbox Live. And speaking

741
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:26,380
of song packs. Song pack 7 is on the way out

742
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:29,620
and we know some of the songs are going to be in that. A lot of classic DDR songs.

743
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:32,100
Everything from end of the century to era. And a brand new song

744
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:35,660
I feel the junk circuit mix. But unfortunately

745
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:39,020
from what we understand the song pack has been submitted

746
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:42,980
but it has not been added by Microsoft yet. Which is the case

747
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:46,420
has been the case for a lot of previous song packs from DDR UltraMix so

748
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:47,280
hopefully soon.

749
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:51,340
Probably I would honestly check Monday because I bet you Microsoft will add them on

750
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:58,000
Monday we'll see we shall see as far as my personal thoughts on the mix like I

751
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,480
said I've played this game more in the past three days than any DDR mix in a

752
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:07,320
long long time I really like it I love the fact that now it feels like DDR is

753
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:13,760
not just being copies of Japanese mixes and by that I mean like you know how

754
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:17,800
like when you run a copy on the copier and then you copy it again like Alex

755
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:21,160
kind of starts to lose a little bit of quality you get some new things on there

756
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:25,840
some new little lines and smidges and stuff but it's not the same you know

757
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:29,440
what I mean so it's kind of been interesting to see this be really the

758
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:33,000
first mix that wasn't going to be compared and everything else I even

759
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,440
think with UltraMix 1 a lot of people were saying oh it's just max on the

760
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:39,880
Xbox but with UltraMix 2 I think a lot of people really didn't know what to

761
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:44,240
expect it got slammed a lot after e3 because the interface was kind of weird

762
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:48,840
and you know the song list was not all that hot at the time because they were

763
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:52,840
keeping all the good stuff under wraps, but boy, when they hooked up with a different

764
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:57,880
drum and got all the new songs, it's just absolutely amazing. And the Xbox Live stuff,

765
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:05,120
the phenomenal, having the edit steps online is great. I would say the only downsides I've

766
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:12,800
seen so far to the game is maybe, I'm still noticing some frame rate issues in some songs.

767
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:15,360
It's not a huge deal.

768
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:17,000
No, it's a big deal.

769
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,040
With the videos running, it is

770
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:25,420
laggy as fuck. I mean, the frame rates drop pretty bad.

771
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:28,800
And I'm surprised with it being, you know, a final product that

772
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:30,720
it's having this problem.

773
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:35,180
I mean, there are some serious frame rate issues with this.

774
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:38,040
But, you know, if that really bothers you, turn off the videos.

775
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:40,220
And I'm sure it'll fix it.

776
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:41,840
It doesn't bother me that much.

777
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:56,840
It doesn't bother me that much, but what does bother me is that I don't know if it's my dance pad, so I can't really blame the game for this, but I'm having some problem hitting some steps, and it might be this weird dance pad, but I'm hearing the doubles kind of have some very finicky timing issues on it, but honestly, those are very minor things.

778
00:57:56,840 --> 00:58:02,840
I had trouble with the controller, too. I'd be hitting stuff, and it wouldn't register, so that was annoying.

779
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:09,240
I think a lot of people were saying that they were a little concerned about the steps when

780
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:12,900
they first heard that, oh, new people are making the steps, and it's, you know, long

781
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:16,840
time DDR fans, and oh, who knows what that could be, and I think there were some people

782
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:23,720
out there that were even dogging on it. Makers of another game were dogging on the DDR Ultra

783
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:26,360
Mix 2 stuff. Which is really fucking unprofessional, excuse

784
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:28,200
me. Well, yeah, we already discussed that in a

785
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:33,080
previous episode, I'm not going to go there again, but I believe it was Cuttriss on DDR

786
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:36,680
Freak said something about those folks are eating a nice slice of humble pie right now,

787
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:40,240
and I thought that was a very good way of putting it, because people are just loving

788
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:46,120
the steps. I honestly have not heard really bad things about the steps yet. Which, in

789
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:50,880
every DDR mix, what's the first thing that people knock? The steps. Every DDR mix. But

790
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:55,000
not this one so far. Granted, there's been a couple people saying, oh, you know, some

791
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,920
of the songs are triple A-able and the timing window is meh, but that timing window and

792
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:01,040
the steps aren't the same to me, you know?

793
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:06,840
Clearly, the person that was working on Sound Pack 6 was not working on this game.

794
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:08,440
And thank heavens for that.

795
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:09,440
Yes.

796
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:12,940
And it's been really neat to see the edit mode stuff online too, because some folks

797
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:16,560
over from the DER Freak thread are already uploading all the ONI edits, I saw some of

798
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:19,900
those on there, I downloaded a few of them, it was pretty cool.

799
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:25,540
The only thing I had a problem with is they kind of tucked that away, you know, the whole...

800
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:30,140
I agree it was not as easy to find as it should have been, but...

801
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:35,340
And plus, I think it's kind of got a lousy setup the way that you download the songs

802
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:39,480
because you have to have the person on your friends list, or they have to be in the top

803
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:43,040
100, which right now isn't a problem, but once you get more than 100 people on there

804
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:45,780
with edits, it's going to be hard to find people with edits.

805
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:51,460
So I think that might be, it wasn't maybe the brightest way to do it, but maybe it was

806
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:55,020
the only way they could. I don't know. It's better than nothing. It's better than nothing.

807
00:59:55,020 --> 01:00:00,220
It changes now another time. Or even later. I mean, who's to say you couldn't, you know,

808
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:04,460
because they have, you know, where you can update your software and stuff.

809
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:07,980
I don't know if I'd ever see that happening with UltraMix 2. I think they'll just do an

810
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:12,700
UltraMix 3 and fix all those things. So we'll see.

811
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:20,820
Well some of us are better than no one, so. Yeah. Alright. Well I'm going to go ahead

812
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:24,420
and open up the Skype line if some folks want to comment on UltraMix 2. You can go ahead

813
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:31,180
and give us a call. Just go over to www.orangelaungeradio.com and click on interact with us and you can

814
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:35,460
give our show a call and let us know your thoughts on UltraMix 2 if you picked it up.

815
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:39,100
Not the Japanese import games just yet. We'll get to those in a little while. I know some

816
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:42,020
of you guys want to talk about Festival and the other stuff. We will get to those a little

817
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:49,020
I just want to talk about Ultramix 2 right now. Favorite song so far in Ultramix 2? What do you think, Logie?

818
01:00:49,020 --> 01:01:04,020
Oh, man. I love the Midi Head remix of In My Eyes. That's my favorite. Second favorite, Monkey Punk.

819
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:10,020
Which is funny because I remember somebody saying that Monkey Punk, somebody who heard these songs before we did,

820
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:13,860
saying that Monkey Bong was not that great of a song. It's actually pretty funny. I enjoyed

821
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:20,060
it. I like it because it just feels like Guitar Freaks. Arcadian, favorite song in the mix

822
01:01:20,060 --> 01:01:27,060
so far? I haven't heard them enough to really give a favorite. I like some of the new stuff,

823
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:34,280
like the new sort of electronic type of stuff. Yeah, a lot of the different drum stuff. Anything

824
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:39,640
that you've heard that you like so far? Jamie, anything you've heard yet?

825
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:46,640
I haven't been overly displeased except for the ten Goku. That was just crappy.

826
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:54,280
Jonas, anything you... Well, I haven't really heard much of the songs,

827
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:59,280
but some of the stuff I would consider my favorite so far, until I actually play the

828
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:04,080
game, would be like Jam On It, or... The booty ones.

829
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:09,640
Or Burn For You. Yeah, those are my top two so far.

830
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:15,520
Gem on, it's fun. I would say my top three, Skulk, Love Skulk, Love Skulk, Wherever You

831
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:22,520
Are by Lava, and Tough Enough by Vanilla Ninja. Love that song, and the video is cheesy-riffic.

832
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:26,580
Love Skulk, but hate the cut of Skulk.

833
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:28,080
You're kind of mad because they took out the vocals.

834
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:31,080
Horrible edit of Skulk, but other than that, it's alright.

835
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:34,080
Once you hear the original, you're just like, ugh.

836
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:42,080
You know what? I don't know so much, because the part with the female vocals is my favorite part of the whole song, and that's in there, so I'm okay with the cut that they use.

837
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:46,080
I agree it's kind of sad that the male vocal could be in there too, but I don't know how they could have cut it.

838
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:54,080
But they need to definitely make sure that this... Stick with a different drum for the next mix. That's what I think.

839
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:55,080
Seriously.

840
01:02:55,080 --> 01:03:00,480
establish yourselves with a different drum because obviously it's bringing

841
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:06,960
them a lot of you know promotion and it's just you know it's a very good deal

842
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:09,160
I think because you're gonna hear all these artists you've never heard before

843
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:13,320
and you're kind of get these brand new artists you know coming out just because

844
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:16,960
of this I'm looking at the chat room some folks in the chat room are

845
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:20,220
answering the question there iguana girl says her favorite song is standing still

846
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:24,000
in time also one of my favorites I keep I keep neglecting that one because it's

847
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:27,240
kind of an easier song so I don't play it so much because I kind of like sevens

848
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:30,600
and that one's only like a five but that's a great song love that song too

849
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:36,280
again different drum great song I see gyrus full tilt mix says dark Tetsuya

850
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:40,760
his favorite song awesome video love the gyrus full tilt video because it

851
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:47,120
actually has screens from the old-school gyrus and a lot of fun all right so

852
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:51,680
anyway I guess we'll do is take a break then we're gonna come back and talk a

853
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:56,080
little more about Ultramix 2. Looks like folks are shy tonight, don't really want

854
01:03:56,080 --> 01:04:00,280
to talk to us on the Skype line. That's fine, see if we care. That's just fine,

855
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:04,320
we'll sit here and talk for you. So we're gonna go to some more Ultramix 2 songs

856
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:07,280
because we promised we would play as many of these as we could for you guys

857
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:10,880
tonight. We're gonna start it off with the other Day Behavior song. I know you

858
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:15,240
guys have heard a lot of Superstar, the Never Aca mix, but they have another song

859
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:18,440
that's really good in Ultramix 2 and it's called Close Your Eyes. We're gonna

860
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:25,440
start this break off with that song, and we'll be back.

861
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:57,440
You and I together in the sky Forever young, we can never die

862
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:03,440
Close your eyes Close your eyes and let us fly

863
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:10,440
You and I Together we can touch the sky

864
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:13,440
Close your eyes

865
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:26,440
Close your eyes

866
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:28,440
Close your eyes

867
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:31,440
Close your eyes and let us fly

868
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:33,440
You and I

869
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:34,440
You and I

870
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:38,440
Together we can touch the sky

871
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:45,220
Close your eyes, close your eyes, Close your eyes and let us fly

872
01:05:45,220 --> 01:05:52,240
You and I, you and I Together we can touch the sky

873
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:58,800
Close your eyes, close your eyes, Close your eyes and let us fly

874
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:06,800
Fly, you and I Fly together, we can touch the sky

875
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:58,480
Yes, smarty-cans, go ahead, find me something new right now, you're so smart, go ahead,

876
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:00,480
I haven't heard

877
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:18,480
I knew you were gonna want me, I knew you wanted me, It might be a different show on the way.

878
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:33,480
And you, you're gonna want to, but you won't do, it might be a different story

879
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:40,480
Keep your mind, keep your mind, keep your mind from falling way down

880
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:43,980
And look, you're gonna want me

881
01:08:43,980 --> 01:08:45,980
Up when you want me

882
01:08:45,980 --> 01:08:48,480
It might be a different story

883
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:50,980
Keep your body, keep your body

884
01:08:51,980 --> 01:08:54,980
Keep your body, all the way down

885
01:08:54,980 --> 01:08:56,900

908
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:53,360
easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song

909
01:09:53,360 --> 01:10:04,760
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 119 in progress.

910
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:07,560
And somebody in chat said that they wanted to call on the Skype line, so I'm going to

911
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:11,360
go ahead and open up the Skype line back one more time, see if we can get a call on there.

912
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:15,240
So you can go ahead and call on our Skype line right now if you want, www.orangeloungeradio.com

913
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:19,000
and click on interact with us.

914
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,840
While waiting for that call, Loki has some exciting news he wants to share with you guys

915
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:24,480
about something we've got set up for next week. Oh wait, nevermind, we're getting that

916
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:27,020
call. We'll get back to that in a little bit. Hi, you're on Orange

917
01:10:27,020 --> 01:10:34,520
Honors Radio. Hey, Rob. Hey, who's this? Jazz. Hi, Jazz, how are you? I'm good, how are you?

918
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:39,640
Good! So you've been playing a lot of UltraMix too? Of course. And what do you think so far?

919
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:42,640
I think it's awesome. You think it's awesome? Now you're somebody, how long have you been

920
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:50,120
playing DDR? 1999. 1999, and would you... You're old school like us. Would you like

921
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:54,360
Now you don't have to agree with me, but would you say, along with me, that this is the best

922
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:56,240
home mix they've ever released?

923
01:10:56,240 --> 01:10:58,740
Of course, yes, definitely.

924
01:10:58,740 --> 01:11:02,000
What is it that makes this mix so damn beautiful?

925
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,760
It's because they took it in a whole new different direction and gave us Americans something

926
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:10,200
that hasn't been rehashed from Japan a million times over.

927
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:11,840
It's the copy of a copy thing!

928
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:12,840
Exactly.

929
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:13,840
Exactly.

930
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:17,040
I would say a different drum is the best thing that happened to Ultramix 2, honestly, my

931
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:22,860
opinion, but, and Xbox Live, because I love Xbox Live. I never thought, I never thought

932
01:11:22,860 --> 01:11:26,300
two, three years ago, how long ago did Xbox first come out? Three years ago or so? I never

933
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:30,020
thought I would be sitting here saying I actually love an Xbox game, but it's true. I have to

934
01:11:30,020 --> 01:11:31,020
eat my words.

935
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:33,460
Yep. A lot of people are doing that.

936
01:11:33,460 --> 01:11:37,220
I know. So how's the competition going on Xbox Live? Aren't you ranked like number three

937
01:11:37,220 --> 01:11:39,420
or four right now on there?

938
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:42,260
Something like that last time I checked. It's pretty easy.

939
01:11:42,260 --> 01:11:45,120
It's easy?

940
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:49,280
Like the timing is really pathetic actually.

941
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:52,320
I like triple A'd at least ten songs last night.

942
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:53,320
I was so surprised.

943
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:55,320
Yeah, I triple A'd ten songs.

944
01:11:55,320 --> 01:12:00,400
Okay, on the 20 November special yesterday, I was playing on light mode.

945
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:03,040
Now shut up, because I was actually on dance pad.

946
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:07,040
I got one great on four songs in a row.

947
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:08,040
Nice.

948
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:10,040
I was so pissed off.

949
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:14,040
That happened to me a lot on Heavy and I was really mad at that for a while.

950
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:18,040
Listen, you and your DDR skills.

951
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:22,040
Now, I don't know, any suggestions

952
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:26,040
you would take to the Konami team for Ultramix 3 ideas?

953
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:30,040
A lot more 2DX crossovers, a lot more B-Money crossovers.

954
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:34,040
I didn't even know that something like Midnight Special was so awesome

955
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:38,040
until I actually got to play it.

956
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:43,320
and guitar freaks. Is it just me or does Sleepwalker sound like a total, is that the name that's

957
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:45,640
on Sleepwalker? Does that sound like a total guitar freak song?

958
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:49,200
It does. And the Boy Zone or whatever that other song

959
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:55,480
was, what was that? Boy Jazz? No, Boy Zone is that you're a band, huh?

960
01:12:55,480 --> 01:12:58,400
Think it's something else. Euromix. That's Euromix.

961
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:03,360
Yeah. Alright. Anything else you want to say?

962
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:06,800
Not really, except come on people, practice, give me a challenge.

963
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:14,200
Oh, a call, a call to those on Xbox Live challenge. What's your gamertag so folks can find you?

964
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:15,440
Kamikaze cat.

965
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:20,560
Kamikaze cat. Alright. Whoop some ass. Alright. Good luck to you.

966
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:21,560
Alright, you too. Bye.

967
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:26,260
Alright, later. Bye. Now what he doesn't know is I plan to take him over in the rankings

968
01:13:26,260 --> 01:13:29,260
very soon.

969
01:13:29,260 --> 01:13:38,380
Now maybe it's just me, but I honestly think that this DDR mix is so good that we seriously

970
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:45,940
need to start hounding, and I don't mean like just writing letters and you know saying pretty

971
01:13:45,940 --> 01:13:52,400
please, I mean hounding Konami, everybody from every angle to let Konami of Hawaii do

972
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:57,380
a new arcade mix and put a new arcade mix out there in America.

973
01:13:57,380 --> 01:13:58,680
Anybody else feel similarly at all?

974
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:01,320
Or have you guys given up on DDR in the arcade?

975
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:02,320
I don't know.

976
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:03,320
Is it just me?

977
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:08,740
Not necessarily a having given up, just no expectation really.

978
01:14:08,740 --> 01:14:12,300
That's kind of where I'm at right now, which is why it would be such a pleasant surprise

979
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:14,280
to see a new arcade mix.

980
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:18,460
And I think that with all this great music they're getting in DDR now, and just the way

981
01:14:18,460 --> 01:14:22,400
it's been presented, and the way the steps were done and everything, I think they've

982
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:27,360
proven themselves that they can do a mix for America and make it really darn good.

983
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:33,560
good, and it's not just something rehashed from Japan. And I think they need to do it.

984
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:39,960
But maybe it's just me. I don't know. What could we do to get them to make a new mix,

985
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:43,800
other than hounding them? I know we can't make anybody do anything, but how could we

986
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:49,760
Hostile takeover! Hostile takeover. We'll buy 51 shares of their stock. That's a really

987
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:54,380
good idea. Yeah, we could do that. Oh my God. Then we would, then as, and honestly as shareholders

988
01:14:54,380 --> 01:14:57,420
they would have we would have interest in the company's activity. That is a

989
01:14:57,420 --> 01:15:01,340
brilliant idea. Is Konami a publicly traded company

990
01:15:01,340 --> 01:15:04,940
though as Japanese? I do believe so actually. One second.

991
01:15:04,940 --> 01:15:10,860
Oh she's looking it up in the business law book. That's a really good idea.

992
01:15:10,860 --> 01:15:15,180
Oh man we should become Konami shareholders.

993
01:15:16,460 --> 01:15:21,740
That's a great idea Jamie. All right. All right Jamie's gonna look that up in

994
01:15:21,740 --> 01:15:29,680
in the business law book over there on what's going on with the possibility of buying shares

995
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:30,680
in economy. Any other methods?

996
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:35,040
Just check up and make sure to see what their corporate deal is.

997
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:40,120
Okay. Any thoughts from you, Loki, about a new arcade mix? Haven't you been saying for

998
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:44,280
a long time they need to do a new arcade mix? Now you're all of a sudden really quiet.

999
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:48,680
Yeah, I've been saying that for a long time. No, the reason I'm quiet is because McDonald's

1000
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:57,060
kicking it that that wanting to die feeling I'm loving it I think I found it

1001
01:15:57,060 --> 01:16:02,500
okay businesses have relationships with all sorts of people other than their

1002
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:06,200
stockholders including employees suppliers customers creditors in the

1003
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:10,140
local community aha under the stakeholder interest theory of social

1004
01:16:10,140 --> 01:16:13,620
responsibility a corporation must consider the effects its actions will

1005
01:16:13,620 --> 01:16:21,620
have on the other stakeholders. Interesting. So there may actually be a legal requirement

1006
01:16:21,620 --> 01:16:30,020
okay, to satisfy those who have a stake in their activity. Not just their shareholders

1007
01:16:30,020 --> 01:16:35,620
but also their customers. This is a great idea. I'm seriously going to look into buying

1008
01:16:35,620 --> 01:16:40,380
Konami stock. You can just buy like 5, 10 shares of stock on E-Trade right? There's

1009
01:16:40,380 --> 01:16:44,720
also this one here. For example, a corporation would violate the stakeholder interest theory

1010
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:50,480
if it viewed employees solely as a means of maximizing stockholder wealth. So, basically,

1011
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:55,080
they have to treat their employees well, of course. But also, that's not just saying that

1012
01:16:55,080 --> 01:17:01,920
anyone who has an interest in the activity of the company, you know, if they're not meeting

1013
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:06,880
the majority interest, then they're actually violating that rule.

1014
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:10,560
So if you love Konami and you want to see them do right, put your money where your mouth

1015
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:13,060
is and buy a piece of them.

1016
01:17:13,060 --> 01:17:14,520
I think it's a brilliant idea.

1017
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:16,300
I think that we should buy Konami stock.

1018
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:17,300
I'm going to do it.

1019
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:18,300
I'm going to look into it.

1020
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:19,300
I don't know.

1021
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:20,920
There's a business major in the chat room.

1022
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:23,580
Can you answer this for me?

1023
01:17:23,580 --> 01:17:24,580
I know.

1024
01:17:24,580 --> 01:17:25,680
Maybe we're just talking out our asses here.

1025
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:27,240
But in theory, it sounds like a good idea.

1026
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:28,240
It really does.

1027
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:29,240
I don't know.

1028
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:30,240
I mean.

1029
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:33,000
Oh, um, Zaku found the financial info.

1030
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,120
Oh, beautiful.

1031
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:35,120
Thank you, Zaku.

1032
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:36,120
Let's see.

1033
01:17:36,120 --> 01:18:06,100
there over it. I think I might have misinterpreted some of this, but I mean, look at this. I mean, okay, granted, like, one person couldn't just buy, like, two shares and then expect to run the company. But if several people bought several shares that collectively had a say, they might listen to you. Maybe we should incorporate ourselves. Seriously. Oh, I think we need to do that anyway. Yeah, but, Orange Lawn Trading will not be a publicly traded company because nobody's going to tell us what to do. Exactly.

1034
01:18:06,100 --> 01:18:08,100
He wouldn't make any money anyway.

1035
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:09,100
We'll be privately owned.

1036
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:12,100
There are earnings for this year.

1037
01:18:12,100 --> 01:18:13,100
One dollar.

1038
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:14,100
In the negative.

1039
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:15,100
Beautiful.

1040
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:21,900
I'd like to thank my friend Julie who I'm on another form of chat that I'm not letting

1041
01:18:21,900 --> 01:18:25,100
anybody know because I don't want them to send me messages all of a sudden.

1042
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:26,100
Alright.

1043
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:37,660
The site, if you're ready, is konami.com slash en slash ir slash, wait, another page popped

1044
01:18:37,660 --> 01:18:38,660
up over it.

1045
01:18:38,660 --> 01:18:39,660
Let me get the address again.

1046
01:18:39,660 --> 01:18:40,660
Okay.

1047
01:18:40,660 --> 01:18:50,580
It's konami.com slash en slash ir slash stockholder info, all one word, slash index dot html.

1048
01:18:50,580 --> 01:18:53,820
And it actually goes back to investor relations.

1049
01:18:53,820 --> 01:18:56,420
I posted that in our chatroom if folks are curious about that one.

1050
01:18:56,420 --> 01:18:57,420
This is kind of cool.

1051
01:18:57,420 --> 01:18:58,420
This is very interesting.

1052
01:18:58,420 --> 01:19:02,740
This is a very interesting direction you've just kind of taken this program, Jamie.

1053
01:19:02,740 --> 01:19:03,740
Very interesting.

1054
01:19:03,740 --> 01:19:10,020
As of 19 November, K&M stock is $22.09 a share.

1055
01:19:10,020 --> 01:19:11,380
Not too shabby.

1056
01:19:11,380 --> 01:19:13,660
I could buy five shares of that.

1057
01:19:13,660 --> 01:19:20,420
Maybe, maybe, maybe we as, you know, find out what would, how many, how many shares

1058
01:19:20,420 --> 01:19:21,420
are available?

1059
01:19:21,420 --> 01:19:22,420
I don't know.

1060
01:19:22,420 --> 01:19:25,700
But, you know, maybe see about what it would be to...

1061
01:19:25,700 --> 01:19:28,900
I don't know the first thing about playing the stock market.

1062
01:19:28,900 --> 01:19:34,660
But as shareholders, though, we would have a right in our voice and how the company is

1063
01:19:34,660 --> 01:19:35,660
right.

1064
01:19:35,660 --> 01:19:36,660
You know, I...

1065
01:19:36,660 --> 01:19:37,660
This is what it is for me.

1066
01:19:37,660 --> 01:19:39,100
I love this game.

1067
01:19:39,100 --> 01:19:42,880
My life has changed for the better in many ways because of this game, and I know that

1068
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:46,660
kind of sounds, you know, maybe sad to some people, but seriously, I've met a lot of great

1069
01:19:46,660 --> 01:19:48,220
people because of this game.

1070
01:19:48,220 --> 01:19:54,260
I've, you know, helped, I've started, along with Dark Sacra and Loki, a radio program

1071
01:19:54,260 --> 01:19:58,620
which I love doing, you know, twice a week, and this game has done so much.

1072
01:19:58,620 --> 01:19:59,620
I believe in this game.

1073
01:19:59,620 --> 01:20:01,020
I want to see this game have a future.

1074
01:20:01,020 --> 01:20:04,180
I'm going to put my money where my mouth is and buy a piece of it.

1075
01:20:04,180 --> 01:20:08,420
One thing that I need to point out to, who is this, Primo Maggot, I guess?

1076
01:20:08,420 --> 01:20:09,420
Okay.

1077
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:10,420
Lovely name.

1078
01:20:10,420 --> 01:20:13,780
You can only buy as many shares that are available, too, for purchase because they are going to

1079
01:20:13,780 --> 01:20:16,840
take certain interest to make sure that those takeover cases...

1080
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:18,280
person doesn't do a hostile takeover.

1081
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:21,400
Exactly, exactly. They have ways of making sure that you're not...

1082
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:24,460
But at any rate, even if you own one share,

1083
01:20:24,460 --> 01:20:28,800
you have basically an interest in how the company operates.

1084
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:34,320
You have a right to say, I am not pleased with what you are doing. You have to listen to me.

1085
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:40,200
Not that I would say I'm not pleased with what they're doing, but I would say...

1086
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:43,480
But overall, I mean in general.

1087
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:46,640
You know, I'm disappointed in what you're doing.

1088
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:48,600
you know

1089
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:53,600
It's just a matter of you know you you would now actually as you have a full

1090
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:55,600
You know an interest in their activity

1091
01:20:55,680 --> 01:21:00,400
Not just an interest as a consumer, but an interest as someone who was making money off of this company

1092
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:02,560
I think I think you got a great idea on your hands Jamie

1093
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:06,820
And I'm care it is worth the hundred bucks for five shares to find out honestly

1094
01:21:06,820 --> 01:21:09,460
You know if really if you want to make your voice

1095
01:21:09,460 --> 01:21:14,360
So you can write all the letters you want to until the cows come home until they're run over by a katamari, but

1096
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:20,820
But if you actually go out, put the money down, and say, I have interest in your company,

1097
01:21:20,820 --> 01:21:26,160
this is what I would like to see, then this is a real definite way to make your voice

1098
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:27,160
heard.

1099
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:28,160
Interesting.

1100
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:31,680
This is going to be very interesting to see where this goes.

1101
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:34,840
If anything becomes of this idea, I'm very curious to see what happens.

1102
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:35,840
We'll see.

1103
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:36,840
Lowkey, you have a comment?

1104
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:42,960
No, I was just thinking it would be cool if they had DDR for the DS.

1105
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:44,960
Second word.

1106
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:48,960
Anyway.

1107
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:50,960
Wow.

1108
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:54,960
Now the chat room is running away with this idea.

1109
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:59,960
Zaku says, I propose every DDR player in the country over the age of 18 buy at least one share of Konami stock.

1110
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:04,960
Maybe pulling legs there, but if you could get a large amount of them to, you could.

1111
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:08,960
And then Primo Maggot says, and then show up at Konami's shareholder meeting.

1112
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:14,960
You know what? I'm actually seriously considering doing it.

1113
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:20,560
Look at this, Jamie. Your school and now this are coming together. You can apply this business

1114
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:22,040
law knowledge your professor would be so proud of.

1115
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:24,480
Even though I changed my major and the class is no longer required?

1116
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:28,560
That's all right. You would still make your professor proud. Do you want to send a copy

1117
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:34,880
of this program or do we say fuck too much?

1118
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:37,080
I think we say fuck a bit too much.

1119
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:43,480
Did they allow me to come in wearing, you know, an eyepatch and a pirate bandana during

1120
01:22:43,480 --> 01:22:44,480
the shareholders meeting?

1121
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:45,480
Okay.

1122
01:22:45,480 --> 01:22:47,800
I'm not gonna do a hostile takeover.

1123
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:54,200
Okay, honestly, if you want to be taken seriously, if you want this idea to be taken seriously,

1124
01:22:54,200 --> 01:23:01,080
no you can't come to the shareholder meeting dressed like a pirate.

1125
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:03,200
But I think hell no we won't go would be okay.

1126
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:05,200
No, I don't know.

1127
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:10,800
Very interesting. Alright, well, to be continued, I'm gonna do some-

1128
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:13,600
I play party games, come on, what were you thinking?

1129
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:19,240
I've got, I've got a lot of time off work this week, thanks to Thanksgiving, and uh-

1130
01:23:19,240 --> 01:23:23,900
I have a lot of time off during work, thanks to my work.

1131
01:23:23,900 --> 01:23:27,200
So now, I, now it's on.

1132
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:31,680
Julie suggested we insert bleep for fuck.

1133
01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:34,200
No way, I'm not gonna bleeping censor myself. Alright.

1134
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:41,200
Sleep you buddy!

1135
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:46,040
Alright, let's get to, let's change topics completely, something we haven't

1136
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:48,640
talked about a whole lot tonight, but damn, it's a big deal.

1137
01:23:48,640 --> 01:23:51,780
What? Where are we gonna be talking? Oh yeah, okay, sorry, Loki.

1138
01:23:51,780 --> 01:23:55,760
We're gonna do the Kiryamoka giveaway very soon, but Loki, you have an

1139
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:57,480
announcement you want to talk about.

1140
01:23:57,480 --> 01:24:01,600
Anyways, as we were mentioning earlier about, you know,

1141
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:04,720
how we were going to have conception on the show and

1142
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:09,120
conception out there with waldo

1143
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:13,080
in the meantime we were talking with another artist out there and i think we

1144
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:14,900
mentioned on the other show

1145
01:24:14,900 --> 01:24:16,360
next week

1146
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:17,900
on orange silence radio

1147
01:24:17,900 --> 01:24:19,920
coming to you live

1148
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:23,420
the guy behind one of the best remixes i think in

1149
01:24:23,420 --> 01:24:24,540
this new

1150
01:24:24,540 --> 01:24:28,400
uh... ultra mix 2 and neddr honestly

1151
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:31,280
midi head will be on the show

1152
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:32,680
Awesome.

1153
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:35,020
And Midyhead is not just a guy that does

1154
01:24:35,020 --> 01:24:39,380
DDR songs either. No, he's done a lot of stuff that you probably heard but didn't know was him.

1155
01:24:39,380 --> 01:24:40,460
He's done music

1156
01:24:40,460 --> 01:24:44,080
for Ryan Seacrest's show that's no longer on air. Okay, let's get past that.

1157
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:47,620
He's done music for Alias.

1158
01:24:47,620 --> 01:24:50,340
There's a bunch of other shows on there. She-Spies.

1159
01:24:50,340 --> 01:24:56,720
He did actually one of the trailers for the Matrix Revolution...

1160
01:24:56,720 --> 01:24:59,080
Reloaded, I should say, one of the songs

1161
01:24:59,080 --> 01:25:03,580
that I entered in Cage Mash and didn't win, but that's okay. Um, and um, just a bunch

1162
01:25:03,580 --> 01:25:08,520
of other stuff. Um, I think there's some other games also, but I don't remember offhand.

1163
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:11,160
But yeah, he will be on the show next week.

1164
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:14,160
I'm looking forward to talking to Midyhead. We got a lot of good questions for him too.

1165
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:19,740
I'm, I'm excited about that. So, now we'll have our first interview with a DDR artist.

1166
01:25:19,740 --> 01:25:21,400
Hopefully. And this one will air!

1167
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:27,760
We'll see. Alright. Anyway. Okay, uh, as promised, so more to come on that. Just keep an eye

1168
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:33,600
on our website for more details on that. And if you guys have questions, um, for Midihead,

1169
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:38,160
you can send them in. We'll create a thread in our forums or you can ask questions live

1170
01:25:38,160 --> 01:25:43,880
during next week's show. I can't eat this microphone I found out. Alright, anyway, let's

1171
01:25:43,880 --> 01:26:01,720
Let's get to the other order of business tonight.

1172
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:09,200
That's right, it is time for the very first drawing in the Akira Yamaka signed CD giveaway.

1173
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:13,460
We've asked you questions Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday nights.

1174
01:26:13,460 --> 01:26:17,940
You guys have entered and we're gonna pull a name out of the hat right now and find ourselves

1175
01:26:17,940 --> 01:26:21,260
a winner right now live on air.

1176
01:26:21,260 --> 01:26:25,100
Don't worry guys though if you didn't win this week, you got a whole nother chance.

1177
01:26:25,100 --> 01:26:29,240
We're doing the whole thing, we're just rewinding and repeating next week.

1178
01:26:29,240 --> 01:26:33,380
And you have a chance to win Monday night, Tuesday night, and Thursday night.

1179
01:26:33,380 --> 01:26:36,380
Monday night's diversion of a Monty Remix show, Tuesday night's pump up the volume,

1180
01:26:36,380 --> 01:26:40,560
Randomness with Dark Sacro, and Thursday night, Outside the Box Gaming with myself.

1181
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:46,400
And remember, listen all three nights, you can enter three times if you listen all three

1182
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:47,400
times.

1183
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:50,840
And I realize one of those nights is Thanksgiving, but you know what, if I'm going to be here

1184
01:26:50,840 --> 01:26:53,040
and do a show, we're going to do a drawing, dammit.

1185
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:55,280
Alright, so Jamie, you want to pick our winner?

1186
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:56,280
Do I want to?

1187
01:26:56,280 --> 01:26:57,280
Alright.

1188
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:58,280
Sure!

1189
01:26:58,280 --> 01:27:00,560
Alright, she's going to pick our winner, she's going to reach into the hat and pull out a

1190
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:01,560
Really?

1191
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:03,080
It's the Dr. Dick hat, I feel dirty.

1192
01:27:03,080 --> 01:27:04,800
Yes, it's the Dr. Dick hat.

1193
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:09,040
Alright, hold on, we're going to, I'm going to mix it up.

1194
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:10,640
I want to caress the names.

1195
01:27:10,640 --> 01:27:14,640
You can caress the lovely names and then pull one out of the hat and we're going to see who wins.

1196
01:27:27,640 --> 01:27:28,640
Jazz!

1197
01:27:28,640 --> 01:27:32,640
Jazz is the winner! Congratulations!

Good job. He was the one that just called, too.

1200
01:27:36,640 --> 01:27:37,640
Yay!

1201
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:42,080

01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:49,400

All right.

01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:10,880
Is he even listening still?

1208
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:11,880
I don't know.

1209
01:28:11,880 --> 01:28:14,880
He probably went back to playing UltraMix II, so he probably doesn't even know he won.

1210
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:17,880
He's all, huh?

1211
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:20,880
Yeah, he just goes, huh?

1212
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:22,880
He doesn't even know why he won.

1213
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:25,880
All right, well, he'll figure it out pretty soon.

1214
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:26,880
He figured it out.

1215
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:32,880
Oh, I guess the buffer, yeah.

1216
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:35,880
Yes, Jazz, you won.

1217
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:42,600
Anyways, alright, so he's gonna win that signed Kiryamoka, what is this here, a mini disc

1218
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:47,120
from Silent Hill 4 The Room, it's a Japanese CD, here I'm gonna, we'll put this on cam

1219
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:49,360
too, and it's signed by a Kiryamoka.

1220
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:53,160
Again, if you didn't win tonight, try again this week.

1221
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:58,680
And he gets the special copy that I scraped with iron wool.

1222
01:28:58,680 --> 01:29:01,120
No you did not, quit lying, quit lying.

1223
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:03,360
But maybe we'll send Jazz some other Orange Lawn Fries as well.

1224
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:10,120
are speed grooves. Oh, that'd be cool. Jamie's going to try and scan it so we can get a picture

1225
01:29:10,120 --> 01:29:13,280
in. We'll do that with the other disk that we're going to give away this next week. I

1226
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:15,960
can try and put this on cam, but I don't think it's going to turn out very well. Let me try.

1227
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:26,960
There's speed grooves to make it play faster. Jamie, you know what we've missed? What? The

1228
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:28,960
The ferrets.

1229
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:30,960
I'm sorry, listeners.

1230
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:32,960
Give me the babies!

1231
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:34,960
My ferrets.

1232
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:36,960
My ferrets.

1233
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:38,960
Hey, don't throw that at my paper.

1234
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:40,960
Babies!

1235
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:42,960
Sweet!

1236
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:44,960
Is this the retard baby?

1237
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:46,960
I think the retard baby is in the closet.

1238
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:48,960
Hey, this is my laptop, okay?

1239
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:50,960
Sorry.

1240
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:52,960
I throw like a girl, sorry.

1241
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:54,960
The retard one died of complications.

1242
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:58,960
It died as crap. Oh, somebody stapled this one. Somebody did an operation on this one.

1243
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:08,960
That was mine, because I had to, yeah, because the geniuses that made those ferrets didn't put, like, any sort of, like, Velcro or zipper thing to put, you know, replace the batteries, so.

1244
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:16,960
Maybe we'll have to give away the retarded ferrets, which can be fixed by putting more batteries in, I think.

1245
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:22,960
All right. We're going to go to break, and when we come back, I want to talk a little bit about some of those other releases that came out tonight.

1246
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:26,560
stuff that I know nothing about so I'm gonna try and call somebody over the

1247
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:30,460
skype line to kind of talk about it a little bit but in the meantime we're

1248
01:30:30,460 --> 01:30:35,560
gonna go to a break with some more music from ultramix 2 DDR and then the cage

1249
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:39,080
match as well I spy is the first song we're gonna hear in this break as well

1250
01:30:39,080 --> 01:30:46,080
as I'm in Heaven and Istanbul Cafe. We'll be back.

1251
01:31:39,080 --> 01:31:41,080
Come on, man! Come on, man!

1252
01:32:39,080 --> 01:32:57,440
Don't wanna be the one to tell you how I feel When these feelings I have really are for

1253
01:32:57,440 --> 01:33:01,000
real The time is right for this, a love to shine

1254
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:05,200
on through But you gotta tell me what you wanna do

1255
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:11,200
I'm in heaven with you

1256
01:33:13,200 --> 01:33:19,200
I'm in heaven with you

1257
01:33:21,200 --> 01:33:26,200
I'm in heaven with you

1258
01:35:26,200 --> 01:35:47,120
Hey, did you hear about that show?

1259
01:35:47,120 --> 01:35:48,120
What show?

1260
01:35:48,120 --> 01:35:51,240
Well, they play a lot of great Bimani and video of East game music, but if you listen

1261
01:35:51,240 --> 01:35:53,360
to it, you have to listen to it again within seven days.

1262
01:35:53,360 --> 01:35:55,120
Oh, I've heard of that station.

1263
01:35:55,120 --> 01:35:56,120
Really?

1264
01:35:56,120 --> 01:35:58,120
Yeah, I even listened to it a couple weeks ago.

1265
01:35:58,120 --> 01:36:01,120
Hey, what happens to you if you don't listen to it again?

1266
01:36:01,120 --> 01:36:02,120
Well, you die.

1267
01:36:02,120 --> 01:36:03,120
I what?

1268
01:36:03,120 --> 01:36:04,120
Hey!

1269
01:36:04,120 --> 01:36:05,120
Wait!

1270
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:10,120
What's this crazy bitch doing coming out of my computer screen?

1271
01:36:10,120 --> 01:36:14,120
Orange Lounge Radio, listen or die!

1272
01:36:14,120 --> 01:36:17,120
Seven days.

1273
01:36:17,120 --> 01:36:19,120
We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1274
01:36:19,120 --> 01:36:22,120
We just heard some more songs from DDR Ultra Mix 2.

1275
01:36:22,120 --> 01:36:23,120
Yay, Jazz!

1276
01:36:23,120 --> 01:36:24,120
Including I Spy.

1277
01:36:24,120 --> 01:36:25,120
I'm so excited.

1278
01:36:25,120 --> 01:36:27,520
I'm in Heaven and Istanbul Cafe.

1279
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:29,820
I'm so excited! I'm so proud!

1280
01:36:29,820 --> 01:36:32,820
He says he's contemplating giving it away as a Christmas gift. Isn't that cute?

1281
01:36:32,820 --> 01:36:34,520
To me, well...

1282
01:36:34,520 --> 01:36:35,720
Well, thank you.

1283
01:36:35,720 --> 01:36:39,120
We'll see.

1284
01:36:39,120 --> 01:36:44,020
He also is in our chat room right now and he says that Istanbul Cafe sounds like

1285
01:36:44,020 --> 01:36:46,120
Exotic Ethnics' little brother.

1286
01:36:46,120 --> 01:36:49,920
Which is kind of, yeah, it's kind of appropriate. I could see that. It's pretty cute.

1287
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:53,920
I love that song, I'm in Heaven, by the way. The one Jason Nevins featuring Holly James,

1288
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:57,420
which by the way is a former cage match winner from this very program

1289
01:36:57,420 --> 01:37:00,460
uh... loki had picked that song in a cage match so

1290
01:37:00,460 --> 01:37:03,500
so when we get to the cage match tonight just realized some of those songs may

1291
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:06,540
end up in a future version of DDR not that we have

1292
01:37:06,540 --> 01:37:08,540
what? yeah you need a new song for cage match

1293
01:37:08,540 --> 01:37:09,300
not that

1294
01:37:09,300 --> 01:37:12,760
we have any pull whatsoever when it comes to DDR songs but you know we just

1295
01:37:12,760 --> 01:37:14,620
have good taste and so does you know

1296
01:37:14,620 --> 01:37:19,340
people that make DDR what can we say

1297
01:37:19,340 --> 01:37:22,640
uh... also after all was one of uh... jamie's previous picks and then there's

1298
01:37:22,640 --> 01:37:26,920
another song called Wherever You Are by Lava. That was one of my previous picks, so that's

1299
01:37:26,920 --> 01:37:31,780
three songs, one from each of us. Pretty crazy. Alright, we are going to get to the cage match

1300
01:37:31,780 --> 01:37:35,720
a little bit, but first off, I want to talk a little bit about 2DX8 style, because that's

1301
01:37:35,720 --> 01:37:40,380
a huge thing that's coming out, right? Oh, it came out already in Japan. It's exciting

1302
01:37:40,380 --> 01:37:44,480
because it has some 2DX Red songs that are unlockable in it, including Spiral Galaxy

1303
01:37:44,480 --> 01:37:48,660
is one of the songs, and then there's these great new consumer songs. I definitely want

1304
01:37:48,660 --> 01:37:53,020
play one of the new consumer songs for you, but first, I thought maybe we'd give somebody

1305
01:37:53,020 --> 01:37:58,080
a call that knows a little bit more about this stuff than I do, because I haven't really

1306
01:37:58,080 --> 01:38:02,820
been following the 8 style news. Jimmy, have you been following the 8 style news at all?

1307
01:38:02,820 --> 01:38:08,940
Kinda, sorta, I honestly haven't had time. Low-key, have you at all? A little bit. Arkadian,

1308
01:38:08,940 --> 01:38:14,420
I know you have a little bit, but... He's trying to find the mic. Yeah, a little bit,

1309
01:38:14,420 --> 01:38:16,420
Yeah, I read a little bit of stuff, but...

1310
01:38:16,420 --> 01:38:17,420
Sounds exciting for you here?

1311
01:38:17,420 --> 01:38:18,420
Yeah, sounds pretty cool.

1312
01:38:18,420 --> 01:38:23,420
Alright. Let's see what our buddy at DarkLionXVI has to say about 2DX.

1313
01:38:23,420 --> 01:38:25,420
Have we talked to him about 2DX before?

1314
01:38:26,420 --> 01:38:27,420
Hello?

1315
01:38:27,420 --> 01:38:28,420
Hello, Sky.

1316
01:38:28,420 --> 01:38:29,420
Hi, is this Ziggy?

1317
01:38:29,420 --> 01:38:30,420
Yup.

1318
01:38:30,420 --> 01:38:31,420
Hey, how you doing?

1319
01:38:31,420 --> 01:38:32,420
Doing fine.

1320
01:38:32,420 --> 01:38:33,420
Alright.

1321
01:38:33,420 --> 01:38:34,420
Little bit anticipated.

1322
01:38:34,420 --> 01:38:36,420
Where's your copy of 2DX8 style?

1323
01:38:36,420 --> 01:38:39,420
Well, it's already in the UPS office here in Vegas.

1324
01:38:39,420 --> 01:38:41,420
They won't deliver it until tomorrow.

1325
01:38:41,420 --> 01:38:44,300
Don't you just want to go break in and get it?

1326
01:38:44,300 --> 01:38:47,820
I don't think so. Not a good idea. He doesn't want to get busted.

1327
01:38:47,820 --> 01:38:51,780
So tell us about some of the things we have to look forward to in 2DX8 style.

1328
01:38:51,780 --> 01:38:57,700
The main menu's interface is like DDR Extreme US's Song Select Wheel.

1329
01:38:57,700 --> 01:38:59,620
Really?

1330
01:38:59,620 --> 01:39:05,300
Wait, it has the Song Select Wheel from EXUS? What?

1331
01:39:05,300 --> 01:39:07,500
Wow, that's crazy. I didn't know about that one, huh?

1332
01:39:07,500 --> 01:39:11,500
Does it have iToy support too?

1333
01:39:11,500 --> 01:39:13,620
Okay, well that's good.

1334
01:39:13,620 --> 01:39:16,680
What about some of the new unlocks, some of the new songs?

1335
01:39:16,680 --> 01:39:18,340
About the unlocks thing,

1336
01:39:18,340 --> 01:39:20,540
Spiral Gatsby and Taiyou.

1337
01:39:20,540 --> 01:39:25,380
You can unlock them by playing all of the 8 style songs including the exclusives.

1338
01:39:25,380 --> 01:39:27,620
However, there's a catch.

1339
01:39:27,620 --> 01:39:29,460
Not use EZ.

1340
01:39:29,460 --> 01:39:33,400
Oh, what happens if you do use EZ, you're screwed?

1341
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:37,100
You cannot be able to unlock it.

1342
01:39:37,100 --> 01:39:41,480
interesting i have to be formal or hard mode okay well mental note to those you

1343
01:39:41,480 --> 01:39:45,380
guys may get eight style don't play easy to unlock it

1344
01:39:45,380 --> 01:39:48,060
and what about some of these consumer style songs

1345
01:39:48,060 --> 01:39:49,820
well i haven't heard much

1346
01:39:49,820 --> 01:39:53,680
even uh... everyday lovely day or nebula grasper i'm gonna try to get it tonight

1347
01:39:53,680 --> 01:39:56,660
okay we're gonna play some of them actually here right after i'm done

1348
01:39:56,660 --> 01:39:59,580
talking to you everyday lovely day

1349
01:39:59,580 --> 01:40:02,580
i absolutely love everyday lovely day so we're gonna play that one we'll probably

1350
01:40:02,580 --> 01:40:05,200
throw in nebula grasper as well because i know that's what a lot of people looking

1351
01:40:05,200 --> 01:40:05,900
forward to

1352
01:40:05,900 --> 01:40:11,900
LED looks like he's back. There were rumors that he left, but he came back. Do you know anything about that?

1353
01:40:11,900 --> 01:40:15,900
No, I haven't been browsing around Vermont-y style about that.

1354
01:40:15,900 --> 01:40:23,900
Huh. Alright, well. That's alright. I was just curious, because a lot of people were saying that LED had left, and now all of a sudden he's got all these songs again, so...

1355
01:40:23,900 --> 01:40:26,900
If he did leave, he came back pretty quick. I don't know what happened there, so...

1356
01:40:26,900 --> 01:40:40,900
And one more thing. On the records, it doesn't show the complete listings of your current scores, the progress. The economy somehow removes that.

1357
01:40:40,900 --> 01:40:47,900
Huh. That's weird. Interesting. Like if you've beaten the song, or what?

1358
01:40:47,900 --> 01:40:57,900
No, just like shows you just greats, greats, like the records of each individual songs, they might have taken that out.

1359
01:40:57,900 --> 01:41:07,900
Weird. You're getting some feedback in the chat room there. Jason says, what does he mean the EX US song wheel? What do you mean by that? He said it's 8 style arcade authentic.

1360
01:41:07,900 --> 01:41:14,900
Oh, let me try finding that picture. I know it's in Bimani style.

1361
01:41:14,900 --> 01:41:20,100
He found a picture of it somewhere. Okay. Well, maybe are you sure it's just not a Photoshop because you know how some of those

1362
01:41:20,620 --> 01:41:24,800
Some of those kids some of those kids over there love to Photoshop

1363
01:41:25,780 --> 01:41:30,740
All right, we'll see. All right, so Siggy's gonna try and pull up that picture when you find that link

1364
01:41:30,740 --> 01:41:33,320
Could you post it in chat room there for some folks that are?

1365
01:41:33,980 --> 01:41:35,980
Really curious about what's going on there?

1366
01:41:36,380 --> 01:41:41,900
Okay. Oh, here's the thing about AI NSB GL as of last Wednesday

1367
01:41:41,900 --> 01:41:45,300
they have BeatMania 2DX11, 2DX Red on their machines.

1368
01:41:45,300 --> 01:41:49,780
Oh, very cool. I want to go down to arcade. You know what? Sad, I'm going to be in LA

1369
01:41:49,780 --> 01:41:56,140
tomorrow just for the day, but I'm not going to be able to go to Arcade Infinity, so I'm

1370
01:41:56,140 --> 01:41:58,660
not going to be able to check it out for a while. But I do want to check the game out.

1371
01:41:58,660 --> 01:41:59,660
We'll see.

1372
01:41:59,660 --> 01:42:00,660
Mm-hmm.

1373
01:42:00,660 --> 01:42:05,900
All right. Okay. Anything else exciting about 2DX Red that you've heard about? The new?

1374
01:42:05,900 --> 01:42:19,900
Oh, by the way, on each style, whether regular or limited edition, you will get a goalie cover of a 2DX red e-amusement card featuring Darume and Tsunaru.

1375
01:42:19,900 --> 01:42:23,900
Oh, cool. One of those little cards you can put... Oh, that's very cool. Alright.

1376
01:42:23,900 --> 01:42:30,900
AI is working on their 2DX e-amusement readers.

1377
01:42:30,900 --> 01:42:39,900
Okay. Is the EMU's thing, were there extra songs that were available on 2DX through the EMU's thing?

1378
01:42:39,900 --> 01:42:41,900
I never really got...

1379
01:42:41,900 --> 01:42:46,900
Oh, they're probably from the network.

1380
01:42:46,900 --> 01:42:57,900
Oh, okay. I was just curious, because I know pop music usually has the EMAL songs that end up in the consumer style make releases, but not so much 2DX, so I'm just curious.

1381
01:42:57,900 --> 01:43:01,900
Alright, anything else you want to share about what's going on in the 2DX world?

1382
01:43:01,900 --> 01:43:03,900
Oh, here it is. I think I found a picture.

1383
01:43:03,900 --> 01:43:04,900
Oh, okay, you found a picture.

1384
01:43:04,900 --> 01:43:06,900
I'm going to post it over.

1385
01:43:06,900 --> 01:43:12,900
Because our chat room is seriously going WTF, because some folks have played it and said it's arcade authentic, so...

1386
01:43:12,900 --> 01:43:17,900
I had heard that the title screen was really weird, so maybe that has something to do with what's going on.

1387
01:43:17,900 --> 01:43:19,900
Here's the picture. I've linked it.

1388
01:43:19,900 --> 01:43:21,900
Okay.

1389
01:43:21,900 --> 01:43:25,900
Alright, I'll have to take a look here. I gotta see this for myself here.

1390
01:43:25,900 --> 01:43:29,900
Oh.

1391
01:43:29,900 --> 01:43:33,900
Oh, interesting. The way it is kind of across the top.

1392
01:43:33,900 --> 01:43:37,900
Oh, okay. That's kind of like, okay, kind of like the title screen. I see what you're

1393
01:43:37,900 --> 01:43:41,900
talking about. Okay. That's what it is. That funky new menu, like the main menu

1394
01:43:41,900 --> 01:43:45,900
where you choose like expert, beginner, how it kind of has that.

1395
01:43:45,900 --> 01:43:49,900
This one's featured in the, I think the one right here on the picture right now, it's

1396
01:43:49,900 --> 01:43:54,900
I mean, it's chosen as a dani ninte for a class course.

1397
01:43:54,900 --> 01:43:58,900
Right. Very interesting. Okay, I'd heard that the title screen was a little different there.

1398
01:43:58,900 --> 01:43:59,900
Okay, that makes sense now.

1399
01:43:59,900 --> 01:44:00,900
Yeah, it's very different now.

1400
01:44:00,900 --> 01:44:03,900
So, but once you get in and you pick the songs, it looks like 8th style.

1401
01:44:03,900 --> 01:44:04,900
Mm-hmm.

1402
01:44:04,900 --> 01:44:06,900
Well, that's good. That's good. And no iToy support.

1403
01:44:06,900 --> 01:44:08,900
Yeah, I know.

1404
01:44:08,900 --> 01:44:09,900
All right.

1405
01:44:09,900 --> 01:44:15,900
And there's also a high-speed setting where you individually choose a song on which high-speed you want.

1406
01:44:15,900 --> 01:44:20,900
I've heard about that. That's so good. Like in the expert courses and stuff, you can do a separate high speed for each song?

1407
01:44:20,900 --> 01:44:21,900
You can do that too.

1408
01:44:21,900 --> 01:44:30,900
Oh thank god. Because that needed that. Because I would hate having a non-stop course and then like I would have like Dune and then I'd have to do 250 BPM. Sucks.

1409
01:44:30,900 --> 01:44:31,900
Expert mode.

1410
01:44:31,900 --> 01:44:36,900
Yeah. Alright. Very cool. Anything else you want to share about 2DX? What's going on?

1411
01:44:36,900 --> 01:44:39,900
Yeah, that's the only thing I can share more.

1412
01:44:39,900 --> 01:44:45,900
When I do get my copy of Eight Style, I'll give you pictures, even a clip of me playing dance.

1413
01:44:45,900 --> 01:44:48,900
Oh, yes, my favorite song. Alright, definitely.

1414
01:44:48,900 --> 01:44:52,900
And we want to talk to you guys, or talk to you a little bit more, when I say you guys, I mean the listeners in general,

1415
01:44:52,900 --> 01:44:55,900
about your thoughts on Eight Style when you get it, and we'll give you our thoughts as well.

1416
01:44:55,900 --> 01:44:56,900
Alright?

1417
01:44:56,900 --> 01:44:57,900
Yeah.

1418
01:44:57,900 --> 01:44:59,900
Alright, well thanks for letting us bug you, Siggy. Have a good one.

1419
01:44:59,900 --> 01:45:00,900
Alright.

1420
01:45:00,900 --> 01:45:01,900
Alright, later.

1421
01:45:01,900 --> 01:45:03,900
Alright, some information there on 2DX Eight Style.

1422
01:45:03,900 --> 01:45:07,520
style. Scared everybody a little bit with that comparison to EX USA, but it looks like

1423
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:12,340
it's just the menu. Don't worry kids, everything else is still just the same. Don't freak out

1424
01:45:12,340 --> 01:45:18,240
on me. Alright, speaking of 2DX8 style, there's some great new consumer songs. It's just so

1425
01:45:18,240 --> 01:45:22,460
nice to see the return of consumer songs in 2DX. So we're gonna play a couple of those

1426
01:45:22,460 --> 01:45:28,760
for you guys right now. My favorite song, Everyday Lovely Day, the LED style mix, I

1427
01:45:28,760 --> 01:45:32,160
love this song, and Nebula Grasper, because that's a really popular one too. We're gonna

1428
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:39,160
play those songs and then we'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio. We'll be back.

1429
01:47:32,160 --> 01:47:34,160
You

1430
01:48:02,160 --> 01:48:07,160
tb

1431
01:48:07,160 --> 01:48:12,160
tb

1432
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:17,160
tb

1433
01:48:17,160 --> 01:48:22,160
tb

1434
01:48:22,160 --> 01:48:27,160
tb

1435
01:49:27,160 --> 01:49:41,560
And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, that was a preview of some songs from 2DX8

1436
01:49:41,560 --> 01:49:47,880
Style, some new consumer tracks there, Everyday Lovely Day and Nebula Grasper.

1437
01:49:47,880 --> 01:49:48,880
Very cool.

1438
01:49:48,880 --> 01:49:54,480
Anyway, we are back and also being released this week, DDR Festival and Poppin' Music

1439
01:49:54,480 --> 01:49:58,760
10. Don't know a whole lot about Poppin' Music 10 yet. I'm just, I'm not up on the

1440
01:49:58,760 --> 01:50:01,880
Poppin' Music scene, to be honest, but I'm gonna try and get Navi back here on the show

1441
01:50:01,880 --> 01:50:06,320
after he's gotten a chance to play the copy. I did hear the Akumajo Dracula medleys in

1442
01:50:06,320 --> 01:50:10,040
it, which makes me very happy. That makes me go squeak. Yes. I guess it's one of the

1443
01:50:10,040 --> 01:50:15,760
E-Mall songs that's in there, so it's very awesome, so. Ah. Happy, happy. Um, and then

1444
01:50:15,760 --> 01:50:20,800
DDR Festival, AKA the catch-up to the USA mix, as some people are calling it. A chance

1445
01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:26,540
to play a lot of Xbox only songs up until now on your PS2 is coming out, or it came

1446
01:50:26,540 --> 01:50:30,640
out I should say in Japan, some folks are getting their copies. I notice a lot of people

1447
01:50:30,640 --> 01:50:34,360
are doing a pass on it because, you know, it's very similar. Those folks that already

1448
01:50:34,360 --> 01:50:38,680
have an Xbox figure there's not too much of a point, but for those people that don't have

1449
01:50:38,680 --> 01:50:42,700
an Xbox, but they do have a JPS2, it's kind of a first chance for them to take a look

1450
01:50:42,700 --> 01:50:47,960
at some new songs and also the new interface. So, you know, pretty good. Just pros and cons,

1451
01:50:47,960 --> 01:50:51,320
just all depends on what you're looking for in a DDR mix so I'll bet you

1452
01:50:51,320 --> 01:50:53,840
anything though whatever they release next year will have some of the Ultra

1453
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:58,400
Mix 2 stuff in it we'll see I could be wrong wouldn't be the first time we'll

1454
01:50:58,400 --> 01:51:03,180
see all right anyway I think it's time boys and girls to get into the Orange

1455
01:51:03,180 --> 01:51:11,780
Lounge Radio cage match what do you guys think sure they say of course I got to

1456
01:51:11,780 --> 01:51:20,160
our song up here. Maybe we should get a new song besides Holik. No. Okay, DXY. No, we'll

1457
01:51:20,160 --> 01:51:23,540
use Holik. I was just teasing. We don't really have to change that. Well, replace the Taku

1458
01:51:23,540 --> 01:51:34,840
song with the Taku song. Taco? Last week in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage match, I took

1459
01:51:34,840 --> 01:51:39,640
a risk by putting in a top 40 song. And what do you know, it worked. You guys voted it

1460
01:51:39,640 --> 01:51:44,920
at the winner it was Gwen Stefani and the name of the song is what you waiting

1461
01:51:44,920 --> 01:51:48,800
for and that was last week's winner remember the way the cage match works

1462
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:53,040
you hear a clip of last week's winner and two brand new songs in their

1463
01:51:53,040 --> 01:51:56,760
entirety as chosen by the orange lounge radio host and then you vote on your

1464
01:51:56,760 --> 01:51:59,840
favorite in our chat room and the winning song goes in a rotation all week

1465
01:51:59,840 --> 01:52:04,400
long on orange lounge radio live all right so here we go let's start it off

1466
01:52:04,400 --> 01:52:08,420
with song number one tonight it's a clip of Gwen Stefani with what you waiting

1467
01:52:08,420 --> 01:52:15,420
for.

1468
01:52:38,420 --> 01:52:42,960
Oh, watch your body, watch your body, watch your body, watch your body, watch your body

1469
01:52:42,960 --> 01:52:44,740
Let's go

1470
01:52:44,740 --> 01:52:48,720
Oh, take a, take a, take a, take a, take a break

1471
01:52:48,720 --> 01:52:52,180
Take a chance to dig it out

1472
01:52:52,180 --> 01:52:55,560
Looking like a failure repeating itself

1473
01:52:55,560 --> 01:52:59,200
You know it all by heart, why are you standing in one place?

1474
01:52:59,200 --> 01:53:02,680
A moon to floss, a moon to carry

1475
01:53:02,680 --> 01:53:06,260
You're moving on because of your thoughts from the zone

1476
01:53:06,260 --> 01:53:09,660
I know it's famous, doesn't matter what society all thinks

1477
01:53:10,060 --> 01:53:13,260
Life is short, you're capable

1478
01:53:18,660 --> 01:53:20,660
Look at your watch now

1479
01:53:21,660 --> 01:53:24,160
You're still a super hot female

1480
01:53:25,160 --> 01:53:27,660
You've got your million dollar contract

1481
01:53:28,660 --> 01:53:31,260
And never waiting for your lunch act

1482
01:53:31,260 --> 01:53:35,440
What'cha waitin', what'cha waitin', what'cha waitin', what'cha waitin', what'cha

1483
01:53:35,440 --> 01:53:37,520
waiting for

1484
01:53:38,460 --> 01:53:41,660
What'cha waitin', what'cha waitin', what'cha waitin', what'cha

1485
01:53:41,660 --> 01:53:44,520
waitin', what'cha waitin' for

1486
01:53:45,200 --> 01:53:48,260
I can't believe it

1487
01:53:50,520 --> 01:53:53,660
Alright, that was a clip of song number one in tonight's Cage Match.

1488
01:53:53,660 --> 01:53:55,960
Gwen Stefani, whatcha waitin' for, last week's winner.

1489
01:53:55,960 --> 01:53:57,860
Song number two in tonight's Cage Match

1490
01:53:57,860 --> 01:54:04,060
comes to us courtesy of Dark Sakura. Dark Sakura, what did you pick out for us tonight?

1491
01:54:04,060 --> 01:54:11,060
I picked a song that was in Amplitude. Okay. I'm pretty sure we haven't done a song before.

1492
01:54:12,140 --> 01:54:17,380
I would remember a band name like Man Child. I forgot the name of it though. That's right,

1493
01:54:17,380 --> 01:54:23,260
it's Man Child and the song is called Nitro Narcosis. Yeah, that was it. For some reason

1494
01:54:23,260 --> 01:54:30,260
I was thinking Narcissus, but I was thinking of that because I was thinking of watching some animes.

1495
01:55:23,260 --> 01:55:25,260
Oh, yeah

1496
01:55:35,260 --> 01:55:37,260
Oh, yeah

1497
01:56:07,260 --> 01:56:32,500
One, two, three.

1498
01:56:32,500 --> 01:56:39,500
Oh yeah!

1499
01:56:39,500 --> 01:56:46,500
Oh yeah!

1500
01:56:46,500 --> 01:56:53,500
Oh yeah!

1501
01:56:53,500 --> 01:57:00,500
Oh yeah!

1502
01:58:30,500 --> 01:58:52,760
Alright though, song number two in tonight's cage match, that was Man Child with Nitro

1503
01:58:52,760 --> 01:58:53,760
Narcosis.

1504
01:58:53,760 --> 01:58:58,880
Let's go around and see what everybody thought of that one, starting off with Jamie.

1505
01:58:58,880 --> 01:59:01,760
I thought that song was pretty cool, it's uh...

1506
01:59:01,760 --> 01:59:04,520
Ashley's fun to listen to when you're driving

1507
01:59:04,520 --> 01:59:08,160
so uh... it gives a uh... nine for uh...

1508
01:59:08,160 --> 01:59:12,320
you know, the speed limit. I was going ninety.

1509
01:59:12,320 --> 01:59:16,320
Alright, let's go over to uh... Arcadian 42 and see what Arcadian thought.

1510
01:59:16,320 --> 01:59:18,640
That sounded pretty cool, from

1511
01:59:18,640 --> 01:59:21,480
Rock of Air, it was a low one from here, but

1512
01:59:21,480 --> 01:59:23,600
yeah, I gave it a nine because it sounded pretty good.

1513
01:59:23,600 --> 01:59:27,080
Alright, a nine from Arcadian. Jonas?

1514
01:59:27,080 --> 01:59:30,680
we'll give it a nine, it sounds pretty good, it's got like a good feel to it

1515
01:59:30,680 --> 01:59:34,360
alright, a nine from explicit as well, and uh, loki

1516
01:59:34,360 --> 01:59:35,120
i liked it

1517
01:59:35,120 --> 01:59:36,840
i think it's a nine

1518
01:59:36,840 --> 01:59:41,280
alright then uh... wow everybody gave it a nine but i'm sorry to break the trend

1519
01:59:41,280 --> 01:59:44,600
but i only thought it was kinda ok, i mean there's just songs in amplitude i like

1520
01:59:44,600 --> 01:59:46,360
better than that one

1521
01:59:46,360 --> 01:59:47,640
i'll give it a five, it's average

1522
01:59:47,640 --> 01:59:49,760
we've already taken some for caged matches

1523
01:59:49,760 --> 01:59:51,540
i know, sorry, i just

1524
01:59:51,540 --> 01:59:53,160
i didn't dig that one as much, sorry

1525
01:59:53,160 --> 01:59:54,060
i gave it a five

1526
01:59:54,060 --> 02:00:00,060
Alright, let's go on to song number three in tonight's cage match. It comes to us from Loki. And Loki, what did you pick tonight?

1527
02:00:00,060 --> 02:00:06,060
Eh, I didn't really have anything, so I just picked a song that I just happened to have lying around.

1528
02:00:06,060 --> 02:00:17,060
Um, this is, uh, another DMshera song, a remix between A and AA. So obviously this would be AAA.

1529
02:00:17,060 --> 02:00:23,060
Okay, here we go. It's, uh, and I love how you just let our listeners know that you're just not even trying anymore.

1530
02:00:23,060 --> 02:00:28,060
Well, I have another song that's decent that I could put in instead, but you already have that song, so...

1531
02:00:28,060 --> 02:00:35,060
Alrighty then, here it is, DJ Amuro, remixed by D.M. Ashura with A-A-A. Enjoy.

1532
02:00:58,060 --> 02:01:03,060
.

1533
02:01:03,060 --> 02:01:08,060
.

1534
02:01:08,060 --> 02:01:13,060
.

1535
02:01:13,060 --> 02:01:18,060
.

1536
02:01:18,060 --> 02:01:23,060
.

1537

1538
02:03:53,060 --> 02:04:01,700
Alright, that was song number three in tonight's cage match, DJ Amorro remixed by DM Ashrah

1539
02:04:01,700 --> 02:04:02,700
with AAA.

1540
02:04:02,700 --> 02:04:03,700
Jimmy?

1541
02:04:03,700 --> 02:04:08,700
It sounded like A to C. It wasn't bad though at all.

1542
02:04:08,700 --> 02:04:21,700
It's really hard to put my finger on it, because there's just something that, I think it was,

1543
02:04:21,700 --> 02:04:35,700
When you hear that fast drum beat pick up to another part that everybody in God uses, it sort of sounded like there was just recycled tricks in it. But it wasn't bad. So I'd have to give it a seven and a half.

1544
02:04:35,700 --> 02:04:38,700
Alright, seven and a half from Jamie. Arkadian.

1545
02:04:38,700 --> 02:04:42,700
That sounded pretty good. I'd give it like 8.5.

1546
02:04:42,700 --> 02:04:45,700
8.5 from Arkadian. Jonas!

1547
02:04:45,700 --> 02:04:52,700
Well, it sounds pretty good. There are some flaws with it. Like, there's like some recycled samples and sound effects.

1548
02:04:53,700 --> 02:05:00,700
And, well, I don't know. It also sounds like some of the elements used in previous DMS shows work as well.

1549
02:05:01,700 --> 02:05:08,700
I respect DMS shows work a lot because you send so much for remixing good remixes.

1550
02:05:09,700 --> 02:05:12,700
As opposed to Paranoia of Cowgirl Survivor Max?

1551
02:05:12,700 --> 02:05:20,700
For that 1, 2, 3, 4, Max is kind of crap, but we heard somebody play it at the station.

1552
02:05:20,700 --> 02:05:28,700
And I have to say, it's not a Max remix, but I love a God.

1553
02:05:28,700 --> 02:05:32,700
But yeah, I might actually do a tin foil for this, so I'll just give it an 8.

1554
02:05:32,700 --> 02:05:34,700
Alright, an 8 from Jonas.

1555
02:05:34,700 --> 02:05:36,700
Loki I

1556
02:05:36,700 --> 02:05:44,300
Would pretend to be excited, but I'm not so I don't care whatever it gets it gets a triple-a because yeah

1557
02:05:44,820 --> 02:05:46,820
Whatever. I don't care tonight

1558
02:05:47,540 --> 02:05:52,000
I'm sure that made a lot of fanboys and girls very moist in their nether regions

1559
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:56,380
But I don't know it it just didn't do it for me. It didn't have the same charm of the original

1560
02:05:56,380 --> 02:05:57,740
I mean it was cool. It wasn't bad

1561
02:05:57,740 --> 02:05:58,540
Don't get me wrong

1562
02:05:58,540 --> 02:06:03,780
So I was gonna give it a six but Jonas brought up a very good point and the fact that it's not a max 300

1563
02:06:03,780 --> 02:06:07,740
And for that I give it a bonus point so I give it a seven overall all right

1564
02:06:07,920 --> 02:06:13,340
But you know what it doesn't matter what we think it matters what you think so you guys can vote in our chat room here

1565
02:06:13,340 --> 02:06:18,260
Are the three songs one more time that you can vote for tonight in tonight's cage match Gwen Stefani what you waiting for?

1566
02:06:18,260 --> 02:06:42,000
And song number two tonight, Manchild with Nitro Narcosis.

1567
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:47,040
In song number three tonight, DJ Amuro, remixed by D.M. Asherah with Triple A.

1568
02:06:47,040 --> 02:07:06,840
Alright guys, place vote now. Send a private message to Sky in the chatroom with your votes.

1569
02:07:06,840 --> 02:07:11,720
And your votes will be counted up and we will reveal the winner shortly, as soon as we get

1570
02:07:11,720 --> 02:07:18,160
the votes. All right, in the meantime, let's go over to Loki because I want to ask Loki

1571
02:07:18,160 --> 02:07:22,360
what's going on in the Simphile world right now. Speaking since we just had a D.M. Ashora

1572
02:07:22,360 --> 02:07:30,200
song, it's somewhat appropriate. Not a whole lot. There is a test version of StepMania's

1573
02:07:30,200 --> 02:07:35,000
Urbanized theme which is a little bit different than most of the other themes out there. It's

1574
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:39,960
kind of a neat look to it. There's dancing characters for you. Oh, the dancing characters

1575
02:07:39,960 --> 02:07:48,560
there are. There is a skin edit of Emi and Hallus Emi that is sort of gothic looking.

1576
02:07:48,560 --> 02:07:55,400
It looks pretty nice. And then of course the fun one, there is Master Chief from Halo.

1577
02:07:55,400 --> 02:08:00,720
You get to dance around as Master Chief from Halo. And that is the funniest thing you can

1578
02:08:00,720 --> 02:08:06,800
watch on StatMania. Other than that, really not much else going on other than you probably

1579
02:08:06,800 --> 02:08:23,800
Did they ever fix the Mr. Spanky dancing character? I think I remember that there were, like, issues with it or something.

1580
02:08:23,800 --> 02:08:29,800
Yeah, I fixed. So, it was just a, I don't know, a bad file or something.

1581
02:08:30,800 --> 02:08:34,800
But it works now, since Mr. Spanky can dance around like crazy.

1582
02:08:37,800 --> 02:08:45,800
Yeah, have there been any new skins for Stepmanially recently? I noticed you still hoard that Technofield one, but has there been anything new?

1583
02:08:45,800 --> 02:08:47,800
Techno-fiend, whatever.

1584
02:09:15,800 --> 02:09:20,480
Also, I forgot to mention, of course, you know, Festival, the new steps are being coded

1585
02:09:20,480 --> 02:09:28,360
for that, and also for the new songs in UltraMix 2, and for the Dancing Sage Fusion stuff should

1586
02:09:28,360 --> 02:09:35,720
be coming out eventually. It's a little easier to do it from Xbox, because they can actually

1587
02:09:35,720 --> 02:09:42,720
rip the steps and code them directly, so it makes it a little easier. So look for those

1588
02:09:42,720 --> 02:09:49,720
the hit probably DDRUK at some point relatively soon. Other than that, really not too much

1589
02:09:49,720 --> 02:09:55,220
else. Just, I mean, if you want to go find some good skins for Step Maniac, go to DDRManiacs,

1590
02:09:55,220 --> 02:09:59,660
go to their Step Mania forum. There's a whole section for themes, and there's a ton they're

1591
02:09:59,660 --> 02:10:03,720
being worked on right now, and they even have a whole thread of ones that are finished,

1592
02:10:03,720 --> 02:10:08,720
and there's plenty for you to choose from. So just go look over there, and you'll find

1593
02:10:08,720 --> 02:10:13,720
All right, sounds good. Do you guys want to know who won tonight's cage match?

1594
02:10:13,720 --> 02:10:14,720
Yeah!

1595
02:10:14,720 --> 02:10:21,920
All right, it was very close. It was won by one vote, and then the other song, it beat

1596
02:10:21,920 --> 02:10:26,480
it by two votes. It was all very, very neck and neck tonight. Tonight's winner, I think

1597
02:10:26,480 --> 02:10:32,720
this is actually a bit of a surprise to me, tonight's winner is Gwen Stefani!

1598
02:10:32,720 --> 02:10:33,720
Geez!

1599
02:10:33,720 --> 02:10:37,720
For the second week in a row, if you can imagine that.

1600
02:10:37,720 --> 02:10:40,720
Oh, Loki says it's on.

1601
02:10:40,720 --> 02:10:42,720
It's gone next week, trust me.

1602
02:10:42,720 --> 02:10:44,720
I want four weeks in a row, man.

1603
02:10:44,720 --> 02:10:46,720
I want Gwen Stefani to get retired, man.

1604
02:10:46,720 --> 02:10:48,720
She's awesome.

1605
02:10:48,720 --> 02:10:49,720
All right.

1606
02:10:49,720 --> 02:10:51,720
By one vote.

1607
02:10:51,720 --> 02:10:52,720
So close.

1608
02:10:52,720 --> 02:10:53,720
Every vote counts.

1609
02:10:53,720 --> 02:10:54,720
What can I say?

1610
02:10:54,720 --> 02:10:57,720
We could have had a tie and somebody could have broken the tie, but no.

1611
02:10:57,720 --> 02:10:59,720
One vote decided it all.

1612
02:10:59,720 --> 02:11:03,920
of course everybody in chat rooms bitching about it oh hell no

1613
02:11:03,920 --> 02:11:08,440
don't tell me that song won hey you guys you guys voted for it I'm counting the

1614
02:11:08,440 --> 02:11:11,960
votes right here I think but I think the people that voted for it are kind of

1615
02:11:11,960 --> 02:11:15,280
hiding now because they see that the wrath is coming to get them all right

1616
02:11:15,280 --> 02:11:20,280
they want to know what came in second it was song number triple-a by one vote and

1617
02:11:20,280 --> 02:11:24,080
then the other song was down by two votes but all pretty much across the

1618
02:11:24,080 --> 02:11:30,280
board all pretty much across the board all right so we will see what happens

1619
02:11:30,280 --> 02:11:34,040
next week in the orange lounge cage match but for now let's get back to ultra

1620
02:11:34,040 --> 02:11:37,080
mix two songs shall we I think we can all agree the ultra mix two songs are

1621
02:11:37,080 --> 02:11:39,960
pretty good and in this break we're gonna hear oh my favorite ones in this

1622
02:11:39,960 --> 02:11:44,480
break one of my favorites toe jam is in this break this song is great it's like

1623
02:11:44,480 --> 02:11:48,280
a country song and then tough enough by vanilla ninja will hear in this break

1624
02:11:48,280 --> 02:11:51,920
too as well as wherever you are by lava for those of you that play doubles I

1625
02:11:51,920 --> 02:11:55,600
I hear the doubles light steps have a certain way you're supposed to play them.

1626
02:11:55,600 --> 02:11:58,640
I don't know what that means, but that's what I've been told, so.

1627
02:11:58,640 --> 02:11:59,640
Means hoedown!

1628
02:11:59,640 --> 02:12:00,640
Square dance!

1629
02:12:00,640 --> 02:12:01,640
All right.

1630
02:12:01,640 --> 02:12:02,640
Here we go.

1631
02:12:02,640 --> 02:12:04,640
We will be right back after this.

1632
02:14:04,640 --> 02:14:18,640
Baby, don't be the strong that survive All the mysteries of life

1633
02:14:18,640 --> 02:14:32,640
Oh, we fight just to keep you away And don't let go of the broken shield

1634
02:14:32,640 --> 02:14:39,640
So keep on living, don't stop believing The devil's a queen

1635
02:14:39,640 --> 02:14:50,640
Could you get your wings and see where the fire breaks?

1636
02:14:50,640 --> 02:14:55,640
Baby, that's up to none

1637
02:14:55,640 --> 02:15:01,640
I need you there, cause I need you there

1638
02:15:01,640 --> 02:15:06,640
Oh, tonight

1639
02:15:06,640 --> 02:15:08,640
So keep on looking upon me

1640
02:15:08,640 --> 02:15:10,640
If you don't come, don't be a runaway

1641
02:15:10,640 --> 02:15:12,640
Go for the fire

1642
02:15:12,640 --> 02:15:14,640
Baby, that's enough

1643
02:15:16,640 --> 02:15:17,640
So keep on living the song

1644
02:15:17,640 --> 02:15:19,640
Stop giving the devil the green

1645
02:15:19,640 --> 02:15:22,640
Get you in the middle of high praise

1646
02:15:22,640 --> 02:15:24,640
Baby, that's enough

1647
02:15:28,640 --> 02:15:29,640
So keep on living the song

1648
02:15:29,640 --> 02:15:32,140
C'mon now, don't be stuck in the depths

1649
02:15:32,140 --> 02:15:35,140
Get your hands in the heartbreak

1650
02:15:35,140 --> 02:15:37,140
Baby, that's enough

1651
02:15:37,140 --> 02:15:39,140
Baby, that's enough

1652
02:16:07,140 --> 02:16:36,420
When I feel blue, I think of you, cause you're true, wherever you are, near or far, you still are my shining star, sometimes it's bad, things get bad, and I'm sad, wherever you are, there is light,

1653
02:16:36,420 --> 02:16:40,420
By my side, I feel all right

1654
02:17:06,420 --> 02:17:26,660
La la la la la la la La la la la la la la

1655
02:17:26,660 --> 02:17:50,740
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, hope you're enjoying the Ultramix 2 songs we've

1656
02:17:50,740 --> 02:17:51,740
been playing so far.

1657
02:17:51,740 --> 02:17:54,180
What did you guys think of Toe Jam?

1658
02:17:54,180 --> 02:17:55,900
Yee-ho Ninja Cowboy.

1659
02:17:55,900 --> 02:17:59,900
Which is funny, because it was followed up by Vanilla Ninja.

1660
02:17:59,900 --> 02:18:03,900
What did you think of ToeJam? You guys explicit?

1661
02:18:03,900 --> 02:18:07,900
It's amazing.

1662
02:18:07,900 --> 02:18:11,900
It's country gone techno.

1663
02:18:11,900 --> 02:18:15,900
What did you say, Loki?

1664
02:18:15,900 --> 02:18:19,900
Where's Earl?

1665
02:18:19,900 --> 02:18:23,900
I had a ToeJam & Earl song in the pre-show.

1666
02:18:23,900 --> 02:18:28,140
funny realization in our chat room before the show, during the pre-show. He was talking

1667
02:18:28,140 --> 02:18:32,620
about the song Toe Jam and he said, it's funny because there's a pun in there because you

1668
02:18:32,620 --> 02:18:41,380
know you're jamming on your toes to the steps. Get it? Huh? Funny. Funny stuff. Everybody's

1669
02:18:41,380 --> 02:18:46,620
a comedian these days. Alright, I think it's time boys and girls to get into a segment

1670
02:18:46,620 --> 02:18:52,240
that I know a lot of you guys just love and adore and that is the FUs of the week. And

1671
02:18:52,240 --> 02:18:56,040
Yes, week in and week out we have to do these all the time.

1672
02:18:56,040 --> 02:19:00,280
Jamie, why do we have to do these FUs every single week?

1673
02:19:00,280 --> 02:19:07,280
Cause we're sick and not gonna take it.

1674
02:19:07,280 --> 02:19:26,480
I would like to offer a big F.U. to the Lexus van freshly purchased that was driving in

1675
02:19:26,480 --> 02:19:33,400
front of me, doing not the normal 1-2 car space that you're supposed to have, but doing

1676
02:19:33,400 --> 02:19:42,280
like five car leaks and going so slow that person takes me off um also I just

1677
02:19:42,280 --> 02:19:51,040
want to give the big F you to PMS because it sucks um really my angst

1678
02:19:51,040 --> 02:19:58,320
knows no bounds and I don't have words to properly express it so oh yeah F you

1679
02:19:58,320 --> 02:20:06,120
this fucking paper I hate you focus on ethics what are those but that's really

1680
02:20:06,120 --> 02:20:11,040
about it I'm just sort of angst it out so I'm gonna pass on the mic and release

1681
02:20:11,040 --> 02:20:15,800
my anger in a more physical method by beating up you know an inanimate object

1682
02:20:15,800 --> 02:20:20,440
probably a fax machine office face child awesome I just need the gangster rap we

1683
02:20:20,440 --> 02:20:24,280
play in the background you know remember if you guys want to send in an F you

1684
02:20:24,280 --> 02:20:27,600
send a private message to sky in our chat room right now while we move on to

1685
02:20:27,600 --> 02:20:31,600
Fuck you, Loki.

1686
02:20:31,600 --> 02:20:35,600
Fuck you to trees and the leaves that they drop.

1687
02:20:35,600 --> 02:20:39,600
My god, there is literally like a couple feet of leaves

1688
02:20:39,600 --> 02:20:43,600
outside. We walk out there to my car and there's literally a pile of

1689
02:20:43,600 --> 02:20:47,600
leaves next to my car. I swear if I leave my car there for a few more days

1690
02:20:47,600 --> 02:20:51,600
they're just going to be covered in leaves.

1691
02:20:51,600 --> 02:20:55,600
It's fun to kick them and make lots of noise late at night.

1692
02:20:55,600 --> 02:20:59,200
There wasn't any leaves on the ground, really, and then came in and they were just like all over the place.

1693
02:20:59,200 --> 02:21:00,400
Yeah, they all fell at once.

1694
02:21:02,400 --> 02:21:04,300
So that fucking sucks.

1695
02:21:04,300 --> 02:21:12,000
Also, fuck you, G4TV, because you suck, and your stupid attempt at doing something clever...

1696
02:21:13,400 --> 02:21:17,300
The Nintendo DS day was fucking lame.

1697
02:21:17,300 --> 02:21:22,200
Okay, I don't like watching TV in a small little screen on my TV,

1698
02:21:22,200 --> 02:21:27,400
Showing the show and what looks like a DS around the show and some stupid chatting going

1699
02:21:27,400 --> 02:21:30,500
on the little bottom screen that's supposed to be on there.

1700
02:21:30,500 --> 02:21:31,920
That's a really dumb idea.

1701
02:21:31,920 --> 02:21:37,720
Stupid, gimmicky, something that would be coming from G4TV.

1702
02:21:37,720 --> 02:21:42,200
And I'm sure all those people fired from, you know, Unscrewed and the Screensavers are

1703
02:21:42,200 --> 02:21:44,360
thanking you.

1704
02:21:44,360 --> 02:21:46,360
You're so clever.

1705
02:21:46,360 --> 02:22:08,360
Um, and finally, um, fuck you that my money isn't on my card yet, that pisses me off because I want to go spending, spending, spending, spending, and uh, fuck you using my GameShark for breaking, especially after I spent like an hour putting all the codes in, and playing with it a few days, and then all of a sudden it just stopped working.

1706
02:22:08,360 --> 02:22:19,360
Thank you, Interact, for selling that, you know, product to someone else, and then, uh, I don't know. Just dropping it all together. They suck.

1707
02:22:19,360 --> 02:22:23,360
Matter of fact, they make you buy multiple versions of the cards.

1708
02:22:23,360 --> 02:22:33,360
I guess cheaters never prosper. Except for me, because I bought a new one. I bought a new one. So there. Um, and that's all.

1709
02:22:33,360 --> 02:22:43,680
Oh, things just keep getting better No, they get worse

1710
02:22:43,680 --> 02:22:46,560
F you to getting stood up That is awful

1711
02:22:46,560 --> 02:22:49,640
Why do you do that to people? That is rude!

1712
02:22:49,640 --> 02:22:52,760
It's so rude God damn you

1713
02:22:52,760 --> 02:22:56,060
Oh, that's alright I forgive though

1714
02:22:56,060 --> 02:22:58,240
I forgave I'm such a sucker

1715
02:22:58,240 --> 02:23:01,480
No, that's alright I try to understand

1716
02:23:01,480 --> 02:23:25,200
I

1717
02:23:25,200 --> 02:23:28,900
FU to the fact that I have to wake up at four in the morning to catch a flight to LA so

1718
02:23:28,900 --> 02:23:34,240
I can do one day's worth of work in LA. I'm training a whopping four people tomorrow and

1719
02:23:34,240 --> 02:23:38,160
they're sending me all the way down there costing them I don't know how much money and

1720
02:23:38,160 --> 02:23:42,880
the fact is I will be working from about six o'clock in the morning till seven or eight

1721
02:23:42,880 --> 02:23:47,720
at night. That's because corporations are retarded. But they give me lots of money so

1722
02:23:47,720 --> 02:23:50,880
it's okay

1723
02:23:50,880 --> 02:23:53,320
and uh... that you to mail p m s

1724
02:23:53,320 --> 02:23:54,680
because i swear we have it

1725
02:23:54,680 --> 02:23:57,520
and that

1726
02:23:57,520 --> 02:24:00,240
all right let's move on and see what some of our other folks in the room have

1727
02:24:00,240 --> 02:24:05,040
to say starting with are katie and forty-two

1728
02:24:05,040 --> 02:24:08,080
uh... bucky the

1729
02:24:08,080 --> 02:24:10,320
parking ticket machine in the courthouse

1730
02:24:10,320 --> 02:24:12,920
eating right dollar and i think

1731
02:24:12,920 --> 02:24:16,720
parking tickets, so I had to go and park and go get the walk up thing

1732
02:24:16,720 --> 02:24:18,680
I lost a dollar to that damn piece of shit

1733
02:24:18,680 --> 02:24:23,800
uh... fuck you to uh... my foot for hurting

1734
02:24:23,800 --> 02:24:25,120
it's hurting for a little while

1735
02:24:25,120 --> 02:24:27,480
uh... fuck you to my

1736
02:24:27,480 --> 02:24:30,800
parts of it are like oily and greasy and yucky

1737
02:24:30,800 --> 02:24:33,000
and I wash it off all the time

1738
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:35,160
and then it's fucking dry

1739
02:24:35,160 --> 02:24:38,160
damn winter does weird things to me

1740
02:24:38,160 --> 02:24:45,160
uh...

1741
02:24:50,800 --> 02:24:54,120
alright explicit

1742
02:24:54,120 --> 02:24:58,360
after having too many tests for one whole week

1743
02:24:58,360 --> 02:25:00,560
even though I passed it all, it took me like

1744
02:25:00,560 --> 02:25:03,400
only getting three hours of sleep

1745
02:25:03,400 --> 02:25:06,240
after working a twelve hour shift

1746
02:25:06,240 --> 02:25:22,240
Sorry for having a 12 hour shift on a Friday, working at 7pm to 7 in the morning, and then later on going to the Bay Area right after. You're only giving me like 30 minutes of sleep. Oh wow.

1747
02:25:22,240 --> 02:25:26,240
Yeah, but then later on I have to sleep in the party.

1748
02:25:26,240 --> 02:25:31,840
for not getting WWE Stacey Q was autographed on Saturday. A friend of mine was supposed

1749
02:25:31,840 --> 02:25:35,400
to go but he couldn't go because his license got stolen. Is Stacey Q the one that sang

1750
02:25:35,400 --> 02:25:46,960
Two of Hearts? Rad! Yeah, she's the one with the good ass. And here's the end of one big

1751
02:25:46,960 --> 02:25:54,060
F you to the NBA on Friday. Like god, Pacers and the Pistons. Why the hell are you going

1752
02:25:54,060 --> 02:25:58,340
to go fight over something or just over a game just because someone's dunked

1753
02:25:58,340 --> 02:26:05,460
over your ass and what is asked for our tests why the fuck did you punch the

1754
02:26:05,460 --> 02:26:12,220
wrong pad who who you thought through the a bunch of cup of ice on you that

1755
02:26:12,220 --> 02:26:16,380
was a wrong person you suck a white man

1756
02:26:16,380 --> 02:26:21,380
instead of some lady who was behind you do actually do it against you

1757
02:26:21,380 --> 02:26:27,380
Yeah, but gosh, the NBA, oh yeah, that also resolves.

1758
02:26:27,380 --> 02:26:34,380
Eff you to the fans at the NBA, at that Detroit game, who are also calling to find the first place.

1759
02:26:34,380 --> 02:26:40,380
Man, why can't we all get along? Seriously.

1760
02:26:40,380 --> 02:26:42,380
Preach on.

1761
02:26:42,380 --> 02:26:50,380
Yeah, when people fighting over things, I think a few people got hospitalized over the fights, and people need to spend it indefinitely.

1762
02:26:50,380 --> 02:26:58,780
Don't come around bling on ooh, ooh, it's the NBA's fault or ooh, it's the Detroit Pistons fault. It's everybody's fault in the first place

1763
02:27:01,240 --> 02:27:02,660
Seriously

1764
02:27:02,660 --> 02:27:08,080
People need to grow up use good use their own common sense not to do some shit like that ever again

1765
02:27:09,820 --> 02:27:16,500
Well, I think yeah, I think well so far that they're suspended it's definitely but most likely gonna be suspended for the whole season

1766
02:27:16,500 --> 02:27:26,480
but who knows I don't give a shit and FUT trees for for putting a goddamn tree

1767
02:27:26,480 --> 02:27:36,820
press under my car I have to remove that but by manual yeah by ripping the whole

1768
02:27:36,820 --> 02:27:49,740
branch itself from the bottom and if you do more SUVs fucking up the road again

1769
02:27:49,740 --> 02:27:56,460
but this time I'm having a loose tire in the fucking freeway almost caught in

1770
02:27:56,460 --> 02:28:02,100
another accident as if I have not gotten to any more car problems recently

1771
02:28:02,100 --> 02:28:07,100

1772
02:28:07,100 --> 02:28:11,420

02:28:18,620 --> 02:28:26,380
am I gonna spend food food money or spend money my GS which now I owe money

1775
02:28:26,380 --> 02:28:35,140
you know explicit you remind me of a eighty-year-old guy who's sitting out on

1776
02:28:35,140 --> 02:28:39,660
the front lawn drunk as fuck yelling at himself

1777
02:28:40,300 --> 02:28:47,460
if this and if this why can't we all get it on it's the damn kids it's all the

1778
02:28:47,460 --> 02:28:55,780
damn kids well it's just fine I'm just teasing you and f you for not being able

1779
02:28:55,780 --> 02:29:02,780
put the Kinect 2X muscles for the Halo 2 games. Figure it out that there's a broken wire.

1780
02:29:02,780 --> 02:29:06,780
Well, oh well. Maybe next week.

1781
02:29:06,780 --> 02:29:10,780
Alright, can I get to the chatroom now? To be continued. Alright, as always. Alright,

1782
02:29:10,780 --> 02:29:15,780
here we go. Moving on to the chatroom FUs. Ooh, didn't we just hear this? I think it

1783
02:29:15,780 --> 02:29:22,780
would be a good FU music, though. MPQ says, a big FU to Washington State for not having

1784
02:29:22,780 --> 02:29:31,340
2DX machines. Poto says, F you to greedy repo men who steal your Xbox. No Halo 2 or Ultra

1785
02:29:31,340 --> 02:29:40,340
Mix 2 for me. DJ Ronma SDS says, F you to the dumb customers at Best Buy. I know how

1786
02:29:40,340 --> 02:29:44,580
to fix computers, thank you. Ask me one more stupid question and I'll replace your fucking

1787
02:29:44,580 --> 02:29:50,880
Pentium 4 chip with a potato. Oh yeah, F you to cock-teasing girls. You fucking suck. Expect

1788
02:29:50,880 --> 02:29:54,360
flaming bag of shit on your front door hey that's one way to win the chicks

1789
02:29:54,360 --> 02:30:02,960
over Jamie Jamie chicks dig flaming bags of shit right I love it when you're not

1790
02:30:02,960 --> 02:30:12,480
paying attention to the show like a yeast infection

1791
02:30:12,480 --> 02:30:16,480
Yeast is good. Yeast is in bread. I like bread. What's wrong there?

1792
02:30:16,480 --> 02:30:19,480
Not Candida yeast.

1793
02:30:19,480 --> 02:30:25,480
Yeast in bread is different than yeast in your vagina, okay?

1794
02:30:25,480 --> 02:30:32,480
Do you know what happens when you get a Candida yeast buildup in your organs, like your stomach and your intestines?

1795
02:30:32,480 --> 02:30:37,480
It makes you die.

1796
02:30:37,480 --> 02:30:44,480
Yeah, it turns your stomach and your intestines into bread, and then you die, because they can't digest. There you go.

1797
02:30:44,480 --> 02:30:46,480
Ferment them.

1798
02:30:46,480 --> 02:30:48,480
Oh my lord.

1799
02:30:48,480 --> 02:30:50,480
We hit a whole new low tonight, ladies and gentlemen.

1800
02:30:50,480 --> 02:30:57,480
Misty says, F me for falling asleep and missing part of the UltraMix 2 show. Aw, it's okay.

1801
02:30:57,480 --> 02:31:03,560
Legend of Zaku says, F you to the fact that DDR Ultra Mix 2 got the better songs and DDR

1802
02:31:03,560 --> 02:31:08,080
Extreme USA owners getting the shaft by Konami for favoring Microsoft with a dollar sign

1803
02:31:08,080 --> 02:31:09,080
over Sony.

1804
02:31:09,080 --> 02:31:13,140
F you to my braces for being retightened, thus making my teeth hurt.

1805
02:31:13,140 --> 02:31:16,000
And F you to the fact that I have two hard to sell exams tomorrow, both of which I'm

1806
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:18,120
not truly prepared for.

1807
02:31:18,120 --> 02:31:22,580
F you to the Pacers, Ron Artest for punching the wrong fan, and F you to the Pistons, Ben

1808
02:31:22,580 --> 02:31:25,120
Wallace for pushing Artest in the first place.

1809
02:31:25,120 --> 02:31:29,040
Our test got what he deserves and enjoy promoting that rap album now that you can't play this

1810
02:31:29,040 --> 02:31:33,640
season.

1811
02:31:33,640 --> 02:31:40,480
Dark Knight says, my FUs to going work especially on Friday the 25th aka Black Friday because

1812
02:31:40,480 --> 02:31:43,600
I know that I'm going to be getting these a-hole customers that always seem to give

1813
02:31:43,600 --> 02:31:49,000
me a total hard time, nothing more.

1814
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:54,360
Seagurd says, FU to the lackluster DS launch, hey but you had G4, just kidding.

1815
02:31:54,360 --> 02:31:58,760
the hell is my worry aware that isn't that isn't feel the magic f you to

1816
02:31:58,760 --> 02:32:01,680
homeless people because they were chasing me in my dream before turning

1817
02:32:01,680 --> 02:32:11,840
into orange launch radio what great damn them f you to drawn together this past

1818
02:32:11,840 --> 02:32:16,080
week for only feeling being mildly funny I agree it was only mildly funny more

1819
02:32:16,080 --> 02:32:20,160
Alexander and Foxy and Ling Ling and less everyone else.

1820
02:32:20,160 --> 02:32:28,000
Final F.U. to people complaining about it taking too long to get G2 unlocked.

1821
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:33,220
I unlocked it in under a minute, so what's the problem?

1822
02:32:33,220 --> 02:32:35,760
You know something they don't, you little jerk.

1823
02:32:35,760 --> 02:32:37,560
You know it damn well.

1824
02:32:37,560 --> 02:32:38,560
Alright.

1825
02:32:38,560 --> 02:32:39,560
Dark Tetsuya.

1826
02:32:39,560 --> 02:32:44,480
DarkPetsuya, I'm going to have to agree with Loki. F you to G4 and the stupidest publicity

1827
02:32:44,480 --> 02:32:54,360
stunt ever. DarkLionXVI says, only one F you tonight. F you to my router for suddenly disconnecting

1828
02:32:54,360 --> 02:33:04,160
me. That's it. Thank you very much for playing everybody in our chat room. Alright, let's

1829
02:33:04,160 --> 02:33:07,160
do some more Ultramix. We're starting to run out of showtime, so I definitely want to get

1830
02:33:07,160 --> 02:33:11,440
some more Ultramix 2 songs in before the show is over. And maybe we'll do some Ask Orange

1831
02:33:11,440 --> 02:33:14,320
Lounge when we come back. Ooh, doesn't that sound like fun? I know you kids love that

1832
02:33:14,320 --> 02:33:19,480
segment. So in this break, Rubberneckin', the Elvis song. We're going to hear that along

1833
02:33:19,480 --> 02:33:25,600
with a rock song called Sleepwalker and Tittle Tattle. We'll be back after this. And remember,

1834
02:33:25,600 --> 02:33:32,600
Ask Orange Lounge is coming up, so send us some questions in our chat room right now.

1835
02:33:55,600 --> 02:34:02,600
Some people say I'm wasted time, they don't really know

1836
02:34:02,600 --> 02:34:09,600
What would I see, to see what I've got, it gives me such a long hand

1837
02:34:09,600 --> 02:34:15,600
Sitting alone in my porch, all by myself

1838
02:34:15,600 --> 02:34:21,600
Blue king, Mary Jane, I'm with somebody else

1839
02:34:21,600 --> 02:34:26,600
Hey, hey, hey, stop lookin' less of me

1840
02:34:26,600 --> 02:34:29,600
That's my philosophy

1841
02:34:29,600 --> 02:34:33,600
It's called repenekton baby

1842
02:34:33,600 --> 02:34:37,600
That's alright with me

1843
02:34:37,600 --> 02:34:40,600
Hey, hey, hey, hey, baby

1844
02:34:40,600 --> 02:34:44,600
That's alright with me

1845
02:34:44,600 --> 02:34:47,600
Repenekton baby

1846
02:34:47,600 --> 02:34:50,600
That's alright with me

1847
02:35:20,600 --> 02:35:42,600
Today is like the other day, I feel I'm lost like it's yet to day

1848
02:35:42,600 --> 02:35:47,600
Nothing stands inside of me

1849
02:35:47,600 --> 02:35:53,600
I can't seem to turn around, turn around to you again

1850
02:35:53,600 --> 02:35:58,600
Nothing stands inside of me

1851
02:35:58,600 --> 02:36:07,600
By the way, by the way, I'm not okay

1852
02:36:07,600 --> 02:36:12,600
To be awake is the only thing I want

1853
02:36:12,600 --> 02:36:17,600
With you, I'm just walking in my sleep

1854
02:36:17,600 --> 02:36:22,600
To be awake is the only thing I want

1855
02:36:22,600 --> 02:36:28,600
With you, I'm just walking in my sleep

1856
02:36:28,600 --> 02:36:38,600
I could forget again if I said, if I said

1857
02:36:38,600 --> 02:36:43,600
With you, with you

1858
02:36:43,600 --> 02:36:48,600
I have to forget again my name, my name

1859
02:37:18,600 --> 02:37:23,100
All for perfection, so very hard to reach

1860
02:37:23,100 --> 02:37:28,600
Harmony machine, tormenting the sensory

1861
02:37:28,600 --> 02:37:33,600
Deliciously evolved, and yet nobody knows

1862
02:37:33,600 --> 02:37:38,600
Diddle daddle, chit chat, shoot in the breeze

1863
02:37:38,600 --> 02:37:41,600
Put a clack, need a splatter

1864
02:37:41,600 --> 02:37:44,600
The truth is a sacred symphony

1865
02:37:49,600 --> 02:37:51,600
Tied from the familiar

1866
02:37:52,600 --> 02:37:54,600
Conjure a search of jives

1867
02:37:55,600 --> 02:37:56,600
Fidget in the mind

1868
02:37:57,600 --> 02:37:59,600
Enjoy chats with no regrets

1869
02:38:00,600 --> 02:38:02,600
Channelizing hallucinations

1870
02:38:03,600 --> 02:38:04,600
Windu licking the imagination

1871
02:38:05,600 --> 02:38:07,600
Fingers digging shadows dancing

1872
02:38:07,600 --> 02:38:10,600
Here's a synchronous symphony

1873
02:38:15,600 --> 02:38:19,600
Diddle-daddle, chin-chat, shootin' the breeze

1874
02:38:20,600 --> 02:38:22,600
Pat-a-clack, skatin' splatters

1875
02:38:22,600 --> 02:38:26,600
Lattice is a synchronous symphony

1876
02:38:52,600 --> 02:39:02,520
radio. We are back here on Orange Launch Radio having a little too much fun with

1877
02:39:02,520 --> 02:39:08,920
PictoChat actually. I found the way that you could pull down the last image

1878
02:39:08,920 --> 02:39:12,760
that was drawn or scroll up and so you can like erase things and change things

1879
02:39:12,760 --> 02:39:19,080
in the image. It makes a fun game. The DS never knew that they had in there.

1880
02:39:19,080 --> 02:39:21,080
And you know what else?

1881
02:39:21,360 --> 02:39:25,660
This is why the end gauge never worked because it didn't have picto chat honestly

1882
02:39:26,120 --> 02:39:32,080
Imagine if you could have picto chat and send those little pictograms anywhere in the USA even to random phone numbers

1883
02:39:33,400 --> 02:39:35,400
I'll be the best

1884
02:39:36,200 --> 02:39:38,200
What is this cock

1885
02:39:38,980 --> 02:39:41,100
What does this cock on the cell phone?

1886
02:39:42,360 --> 02:39:45,200
Why you call me a cock? I am no rooster

1887
02:39:45,200 --> 02:39:55,080
Let's get to some Ask Orange Lounge, remember if you guys have a question, send it in over

1888
02:39:55,080 --> 02:39:58,480
private message right now, also we'll open up the Skype line in a little bit if you guys

1889
02:39:58,480 --> 02:40:08,360
want to call in and have a comment or something, I don't know, but here we go.

1890
02:40:08,360 --> 02:40:13,640
Let's Ask Orange Lounge, some stupid question, what will we find out this week on Orange

1891
02:40:13,640 --> 02:40:19,800
lounge radio all I really know is that it's a really good thing that you guys

1892
02:40:19,800 --> 02:40:26,960
can't see our picto chats because then you'd think we're perverts as if you

1893
02:40:26,960 --> 02:40:34,660
didn't already know that extra verse tonight all right uh Flair O'Day says

1894
02:40:34,660 --> 02:40:39,880
this hey isn't it a bit strange that they put a good chunk of the unlocks for

1895
02:40:39,880 --> 02:40:43,520
ultra mix 2 on the v-ware and you know what come to think of it a good half of

1896
02:40:43,520 --> 02:40:47,520
The Extreme V-Rare songs are unlocks too! What's up with that?

1897
02:40:47,520 --> 02:40:52,520
I kind of agree. It kind of took a little bit of the thrill out of the unlocks, the fact that they were all already on the V-Rare.

1898
02:40:52,520 --> 02:40:56,520
But at the same time, it was some of the best stuff on the mix, so I don't know.

1899
02:40:56,520 --> 02:41:03,520
I would have liked to have seen more of the different drum songs, but I just thought the V-Rare was great because it had Skulk and Superstar. I thought that was neat.

1900
02:41:03,520 --> 02:41:07,520
Any other comments? Thoughts on the Ultramix 2 V-Rare?

1901
02:41:07,520 --> 02:41:10,520
It was pretty good. I liked it.

1902
02:41:10,520 --> 02:41:13,320
What is this weird that they put so many unlocks on it?

1903
02:41:13,320 --> 02:41:16,420
You pretty much knew 9 of the un- or was it 9 or 10? I don't know.

1904
02:41:16,420 --> 02:41:19,020
A lot. A whole lot of the unlocks just by, um,

1905
02:41:19,820 --> 02:41:22,320
picking yourself up a copy of the viewer, which, by the way,

1906
02:41:22,320 --> 02:41:26,320
I'm trying to snag us some extra copies so that we can give them away on the show.

1907
02:41:26,820 --> 02:41:30,320
So, even after the Kiriyamaoka giveaway is done, um, we'll do, uh,

1908
02:41:30,320 --> 02:41:32,720
hopefully another giveaway, some Ultramix 2 v-rares,

1909
02:41:32,720 --> 02:41:36,020
uh, maybe for much easier things, just like calling in at a certain time or something.

1910
02:41:36,020 --> 02:41:37,520
We'll see. We'll see. I don't know.

1911
02:41:37,520 --> 02:41:44,200
Alright, moving in and on. Let's see what Dark Knight has to say. Okay. If a tree falls

1912
02:41:44,200 --> 02:41:48,680
in the woods, does it make a sound? No, just kidding. The real question is, how much of

1913
02:41:48,680 --> 02:41:54,800
a lifespan will the DS have before Nintendo decides to make a new handheld? Any thoughts

1914
02:41:54,800 --> 02:42:03,080
on this? Loki. By new handheld, do you mean another color? Seriously, I give it, uh, February

1915
02:42:03,080 --> 02:42:07,440
will have new DS colors honestly and then then there will be some kind of

1916
02:42:07,440 --> 02:42:09,560
super DS or like DS

1917
02:42:09,560 --> 02:42:11,560
extreme or some something

1918
02:42:11,560 --> 02:42:15,100
where you're gonna have to re-buy the DS because they did the same damn thing with the

1919
02:42:15,100 --> 02:42:18,000
Game Boy when they did the little...

1920
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:22,120
They're gonna do DS mess colors and DS Famicom colors and...

1921
02:42:22,120 --> 02:42:23,280
I mean look

1922
02:42:23,280 --> 02:42:26,040
they had Game Boy and then they had Game Boy Pocket

1923
02:42:26,040 --> 02:42:28,920
then they had Game Boy Color then they had all the fucking

1924
02:42:28,920 --> 02:42:30,940
colored Game Boy colors

1925
02:42:30,940 --> 02:42:34,140
and then they're not going to be as much crap as the PSP will be and then they

1926
02:42:34,140 --> 02:42:38,480
had Game Boy Advance and they had the SP so it is only likely the DS will have

1927
02:42:38,480 --> 02:42:39,420
some kind of

1928
02:42:39,420 --> 02:42:43,720
and then you have the Virtual Boy and the

1929
02:42:43,720 --> 02:42:44,920
oh yeah

1930
02:42:44,920 --> 02:42:46,320
alright we got the DS

1931
02:42:46,320 --> 02:42:49,800
and if it does well I anticipate you're going to see some newer model come out

1932
02:42:49,800 --> 02:42:50,260
that

1933
02:42:50,260 --> 02:42:54,040
everybody's going to want to have to have

1934
02:42:54,040 --> 02:42:56,600
a secret in our chat room says people

1935
02:42:56,600 --> 02:43:02,600
There are no color combinations that will work besides the silver and black. I have thought about this for hours.

1936
02:43:05,600 --> 02:43:06,600
Get a life.

1937
02:43:08,600 --> 02:43:11,600
Yeah, the QS. Quad screen.

1938
02:43:12,600 --> 02:43:17,600
Let's see how many screens we can cram into this thing. I don't know.

1939
02:43:17,600 --> 02:43:26,600
So, to be honest, I think the next thing you're going to hear about DS is going to be a Bluetooth network where you can actually play online internet games.

1940
02:43:26,600 --> 02:43:28,600
And it'll be a peripheral, though.

1941
02:43:28,600 --> 02:43:35,600
It's coming out. Warppipe is working on it. They're not saying that's what they're working on, but that's what they're working on.

1942
02:43:35,600 --> 02:43:43,600
So, you'll see that at E3 this year, though, because they're going to be at E3 this year. But, not until then.

1943
02:43:43,600 --> 02:43:46,600
Alright, let's go on to the next question.

1944
02:43:46,600 --> 02:43:51,400
DJ Doe, how did you get the music from Ultramix on the Orange Lawns radio?

1945
02:43:51,400 --> 02:43:56,240
The reason I'm asking is because I like to make a music CD out of the songs from Ultramix.

1946
02:43:56,240 --> 02:43:57,240
Very carefully.

1947
02:43:57,240 --> 02:43:58,920
No, we rip them ourselves actually.

1948
02:43:58,920 --> 02:44:02,720
We have the soundboard hooked up through the Xbox, that's how we got tonight's songs.

1949
02:44:02,720 --> 02:44:06,760
And I know they're not like 100% perfect quality, so honestly you may not want to burn them

1950
02:44:06,760 --> 02:44:08,400
to CD.

1951
02:44:08,400 --> 02:44:12,080
But honestly, just keep looking around there on some of the different forums out there

1952
02:44:12,080 --> 02:44:13,080
on the net.

1953
02:44:13,080 --> 02:44:14,500
Something will turn up soon enough.

1954
02:44:14,500 --> 02:44:15,500
Always does.

1955
02:44:15,500 --> 02:44:16,500
Any advice, Loki?

1956
02:44:16,500 --> 02:44:18,500
DDRUK once the Symphiles are out.

1957
02:44:18,500 --> 02:44:22,500
Yeah, honestly, most of your Symphiles sites will have them pretty soon, so.

1958
02:44:22,500 --> 02:44:26,500
But you should continue to listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because we play them first.

1959
02:44:26,500 --> 02:44:29,500
At least, usually. Not always, but sometimes.

1960
02:44:29,500 --> 02:44:31,500
Alright, Legend of Zaku says,

1961
02:44:31,500 --> 02:44:37,500
Why are DDR Extreme USA owners getting the shaft now that UltraMix 2 came out and got the better of the songs?

1962
02:44:39,500 --> 02:44:44,500
I think they just tried to do something different with Extreme, with the whole iToy thing.

1963
02:44:44,500 --> 02:44:47,620
you could argue well you know Xbox doesn't have hands and feet mode and I

1964
02:44:47,620 --> 02:44:52,380
know that makes a lot of you guys go big fucking deal but they tried to do

1965
02:44:52,380 --> 02:44:55,360
something different with the PlayStation just like they were doing different

1966
02:44:55,360 --> 02:44:59,100
things with UltraMix 2 so I don't want to knock the PlayStation 2 for at least

1967
02:44:59,100 --> 02:45:01,540
trying something different that wasn't there before and it wasn't just the

1968
02:45:01,540 --> 02:45:06,200
itoy things we know some new interface new songs things like that it just you

1969
02:45:06,200 --> 02:45:09,580
know it's not always gonna work a hundred percent of the time but I have

1970
02:45:09,580 --> 02:45:14,000
some faith that they will take the feedback and come out and give us

1971
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:16,900
something better for the PlayStation next year because I do think it's inevitable we

1972
02:45:16,900 --> 02:45:20,840
will see new releases on Xbox and PlayStation 2 next year. But again, the only way you're

1973
02:45:20,840 --> 02:45:28,920
going to see that is if you buy the damn games. So don't get copies. Buy them and that's it.

1974
02:45:28,920 --> 02:45:33,520
Any other comments on that one?

1975
02:45:33,520 --> 02:45:36,520
Buy. Purchase.

1976
02:45:36,520 --> 02:45:42,240
Absolutely. All right, you see, I'm already getting into the chat room. Big fucking deal.

1977
02:45:42,240 --> 02:45:49,240
Well, you know, it's just they wanted to do something different, they took it in a different direction, and for a lot of us it didn't work. What can you do?

1978
02:45:49,240 --> 02:45:51,240
They think they're not shareholders.

1979
02:45:51,240 --> 02:45:56,240
And then how many crappy songs can you find in Extreme USA versus how many can you find in Ultramix 2?

1980
02:45:56,240 --> 02:46:01,240
Well, I don't know. I mean, I believe, if I'm not mistaken, it's kind of up- I don't know.

1981
02:46:01,240 --> 02:46:04,360
everybody thinks they know but I think

1982
02:46:04,360 --> 02:46:08,380
Japan for the most part did Extreme and Hawaii, well we know Hawaii

1983
02:46:08,380 --> 02:46:11,720
pretty much for the most part did UltraMix 2 with some help from their

1984
02:46:11,720 --> 02:46:15,160
staff in the bay so I don't know

1985
02:46:15,160 --> 02:46:19,660
I don't know anyway it's just different they tried something different and for

1986
02:46:19,660 --> 02:46:21,500
some folks it didn't work

1987
02:46:21,500 --> 02:46:24,740
I don't think it was that bad I still like DDR Extreme I think it has some

1988
02:46:24,740 --> 02:46:28,580
good songs in it, it doesn't have as many good songs as UltraMix 2 granted but

1989
02:46:28,580 --> 02:46:30,700
Maybe Konami will learn something from UltraMix 2.

1990
02:46:30,700 --> 02:46:35,740
They took a risk. They took a really big risk with UltraMix 2, I think, because there were

1991
02:46:35,740 --> 02:46:39,460
going to be... In fact, there were people out there that said it's not Japanese enough.

1992
02:46:39,460 --> 02:46:43,340
It doesn't have enough of the Japanese songs. But I think that's why they went and the Japanese

1993
02:46:43,340 --> 02:46:49,660
songs they picked, they picked very carefully. Moonlight Shadow, Dam Daryam, Volume 4, those

1994
02:46:49,660 --> 02:46:56,420
are all throwbacks to the fans. They didn't pick them because those were songs for the

1995
02:46:56,420 --> 02:47:02,440
fans. Don't doubt it. But it was a risk. I mean, they could have come back, people could

1996
02:47:02,440 --> 02:47:06,160
have said, a different drum sucks, why did you guys put all this fucking synth pop in

1997
02:47:06,160 --> 02:47:10,360
there? And you know there's probably somebody out there who's saying that, but for the most

1998
02:47:10,360 --> 02:47:14,840
part people are taking very well to the new music and hopefully it'll continue. MPQ wants

1999
02:47:14,840 --> 02:47:19,120
to know which is better, paying $400 for a Japanese PlayStation 2 2DX end controller

2000
02:47:19,120 --> 02:47:27,120
or driving 14 hours to Ventura, California to play 2DX. I've done both, sadly enough,

2001
02:47:27,120 --> 02:47:37,660
although my drive was only 8 hours. But, I don't know. You know what, even when you get

2002
02:47:37,660 --> 02:47:41,760
it at home, it doesn't quite compare to the arcade, especially because the consumer releases

2003
02:47:41,760 --> 02:47:46,640
are a little bit behind the arcade releases. So honestly, I wish I could tell you one or

2004
02:47:46,640 --> 02:47:50,960
other was better but face it you're gonna end up doing both just like I did

2005
02:47:50,960 --> 02:47:57,360
it's like masturbation and sex sure masturbation is all right it's not quite

2006
02:47:57,360 --> 02:48:02,920
as good as sex but you know what in the end you're gonna end up doing both

2007
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:14,480
dot dot dot DD Archaholic says hi Rob Jamie Matt hi I just thought of a super

2008
02:48:14,480 --> 02:48:20,360
idea and wondered what you thought. Would you do an all-night Orange Lounge Radio Marathon

2009
02:48:20,360 --> 02:48:24,040
live show like on a Saturday night? You could do it for charity even.

2010
02:48:24,040 --> 02:48:28,760
That'd be fun. Yes. It'd be like a slumber party with vodka.

2011
02:48:28,760 --> 02:48:34,840
Yes, with one condition. I want an arcade to host it. If we're going to do it overnight,

2012
02:48:34,840 --> 02:48:39,440
I'm not going to do it in this little apartment. I want arcade games and things to do. So if

2013
02:48:39,440 --> 02:48:42,840
we could get an arcade in the Sacramento area to agree to it, and I think if we worked the

2014
02:48:42,840 --> 02:48:47,600
charity angle yes I'm all down for it absolutely I think it could be fun or

2015
02:48:47,600 --> 02:48:53,000
maybe we could talk to our buddy at the theater possibly that might be an idea I

2016
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:56,400
don't know if they want a big screen uh-huh that's that's an idea well I

2017
02:48:56,400 --> 02:49:00,160
think about that one can you imagine if we could get picked out yet in that

2018
02:49:00,160 --> 02:49:08,000
giant screen that would be so cool sorry the orange lounge lock-in I like the

2019
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:12,640
idea I like the charity angle especially with Christmas coming up yes

2020
02:49:12,640 --> 02:49:18,240
asylum we lock you in great yeah yeah I'm like the asylum is a dance club

2021
02:49:18,240 --> 02:49:23,560
don't get it confused I really do like that idea and in fact I want to get in

2022
02:49:23,560 --> 02:49:25,840
touch with you later about that DD alcoholic because maybe you can help me

2023
02:49:25,840 --> 02:49:29,320
approach some arcades about it see if anybody would be willing to do it I

2024
02:49:29,320 --> 02:49:32,960
think it'd be fun if not we could just always bring our shit to country club

2025
02:49:32,960 --> 02:49:36,480
lanes because they're open 24 hours anyway but I'm all down for it I think

2026
02:49:36,480 --> 02:49:43,960
be fun. All right. Misty says, what do you guys want for Christmas? Oh, I'm so glad she's

2027
02:49:43,960 --> 02:49:57,800
asking. Money, lots of it. My two front teeth. And some spinach. I want sex. But not from

2028
02:49:57,800 --> 02:50:05,560
Santa. But not with your two. Santa's got years of experience. That's all right. Santa

2029
02:50:05,560 --> 02:50:08,880
would be quite the sugar daddy if you think about it I want someone to pay for

2030
02:50:08,880 --> 02:50:14,600
my plane ticket home oh no in all seriousness what do I want for Christmas

2031
02:50:14,600 --> 02:50:17,160
and all serious I like gift certificates because I like going to buy my own

2032
02:50:17,160 --> 02:50:23,680
things but I want I want more games and I want more I don't know I just want I

2033
02:50:23,680 --> 02:50:27,800
want a big party with like a lot of my friends because I like parties and I

2034
02:50:27,800 --> 02:50:30,920
know some friends of mine are gonna host them so that's cool it works out I'm not

2035
02:50:30,920 --> 02:50:34,520
really big on material things pretty much like if I want something bad enough

2036
02:50:34,520 --> 02:50:39,520
I just go and get it. Honestly, I think the best gifts I've gotten in the past were, like,

2037
02:50:39,520 --> 02:50:44,220
things that people made. Like, one year Sharks Girl made me this collage for my birthday,

2038
02:50:44,220 --> 02:50:48,440
like, because she was really into scrapbooking then. I think she still is a little bit. And

2039
02:50:48,440 --> 02:50:51,760
she made this awesome collage. That was, like, one of the best presents I ever got, seriously.

2040
02:50:51,760 --> 02:50:55,180
I just like little things like that. I mean, you know, I pretty much buy all the things

2041
02:50:55,180 --> 02:50:59,400
I really want, so I don't have a big list of material things. But I like that stuff.

2042
02:50:59,400 --> 02:51:04,300
i think a lot of people like that kind of stuff

2043
02:51:04,300 --> 02:51:08,900
well i'd like money

2044
02:51:08,900 --> 02:51:15,820
but most importantly anything that's priceless really

2045
02:51:15,820 --> 02:51:16,620
all right

2046
02:51:16,620 --> 02:51:18,940
uh... let's go on to

2047
02:51:18,940 --> 02:51:21,260
somebody else uh... another question

2048
02:51:21,260 --> 02:51:23,560
d j ron mass d s says

2049
02:51:23,560 --> 02:51:24,500
my question

2050
02:51:24,500 --> 02:51:28,860
will you and the rest of orange lounge radio be suicidal enough to go shopping

2051
02:51:28,860 --> 02:51:33,660
on Black Friday, which is, of course, the day after Thanksgiving. Biggest shopping day

2052
02:51:33,660 --> 02:51:35,940
of the year. Any plans to go shopping? Jamie?

2053
02:51:35,940 --> 02:51:40,980
Um, yeah, actually I am. But you're going to be in Alabama then, right?

2054
02:51:40,980 --> 02:51:43,140
But yeah, I'm still going to be doing some shopping. Still pretty crazy.

2055
02:51:43,140 --> 02:51:45,660
Actually, no, that's that Friday. I'm actually going to be in Dothan.

2056
02:51:45,660 --> 02:51:48,860
Oh, okay. Um, but I am.

2057
02:51:48,860 --> 02:51:53,300
Oh my God, that's where my boss is from. That's so funny. That's funny.

2058
02:51:53,300 --> 02:51:57,140
I'll go bomb them for you. No, not my boss's house, what Loki said. I

2059
02:51:57,140 --> 02:52:09,140
As far as shopping, no. I don't plan on going to the mall that day. There's nothing that exciting about it for me. I'm going to stay home and masturbate all day. No, I'm kidding. I don't know what I'm going to do.

2060
02:52:09,140 --> 02:52:14,460
I may make it out if I have stuff to buy I don't know I have to think of what I

2061
02:52:14,460 --> 02:52:22,180
want to buy depends if I have my money by then which I hopefully will so yeah I

2062
02:52:22,180 --> 02:52:26,540
just want to sleep and play Final Fantasy and Ultramix too is that so

2063
02:52:26,540 --> 02:52:31,580

02:52:38,220 --> 02:52:43,580
thanksgiving day table aka unique side dishes out of the norm

2066
02:52:43,580 --> 02:52:47,180

02:52:47,180 --> 02:52:50,940

They put food in front of me. I'm off the diet today. Feed me.

2075
02:53:08,120 --> 02:53:11,120
And remember, don't eat in DDR.

2076
02:53:11,120 --> 02:53:17,120
Oh, but I should take a minute to plug the special that our buddies over on DDR Freak Radio are doing on Thanksgiving.

2077
02:53:17,120 --> 02:53:20,120
They're doing, like, an all-day marathon of DDR, like, back-to-back.

2078
02:53:20,120 --> 02:53:24,120
Like, non-stop till your brain explodes. Seriously, it's gonna be cool.

2079
02:53:24,120 --> 02:53:27,120
Like, what? Second mix, third mix, fourth mix, all of it, back-to-back.

2080
02:53:27,120 --> 02:53:29,120
What time are they starting over there? Nine, ten o'clock?

2081
02:53:29,120 --> 02:53:31,120
I don't know. Check DDRFreak.com for the details.

2082
02:53:31,120 --> 02:53:32,120
Go to DDRFreak, yeah.

2083
02:53:32,120 --> 02:53:34,940

02:53:40,740 --> 02:53:45,040
at my table we don't I don't eat turkey I hate turkey so Thanksgiving is a

2086
02:53:45,040 --> 02:53:48,740
really shitty holiday for me but my mom says she will be cooking ham and I like

2087
02:53:48,740 --> 02:53:51,820
him and she actually says she might just be ready to say fuck it and order a

2088
02:53:51,820 --> 02:53:54,820
pizza which I've been telling her to do for years so we might do that

2089
02:53:54,820 --> 02:54:01,820
Dark Tetsuya said, have any of you picked up Metal Gear Solid 3 yet? If so, what do you think so far?

2090
02:54:24,820 --> 02:54:34,060
Rumbleroses is every cheesy thing you would want it to be. It is so horrifically bad in

2091
02:54:34,060 --> 02:54:42,140
a great way. Last question. Oh, not really a question, but a comment from DDRchaholic

2092
02:54:42,140 --> 02:54:48,840
says, sounds good, I'll make calls and stuff. Good, good deal. Maybe we'll open up the Skype

2093
02:54:48,840 --> 02:54:52,580
line for like one quick call if anybody wants to get in there. I don't know, we'll open

2094
02:54:52,580 --> 02:54:58,540
it up, see if anybody wants to call. A lot of good questions. Next week on the show,

2095
02:54:58,540 --> 02:55:02,180
don't forget that Midihead is going to be interviewed. That's something we're really

2096
02:55:02,180 --> 02:55:05,400
looking forward to. It's going to be good to talk to him. I want to know if he remixed,

2097
02:55:05,400 --> 02:55:08,800
if he's remixed anything else. That's what I want to know. Because that, in my eyes,

2098
02:55:08,800 --> 02:55:12,780
remix is damn good. So I want to know if there's anything else there. You can visit his site

2099
02:55:12,780 --> 02:55:19,060
over at midihead.com, of course, and hopefully we get more people in the future as well.

2100
02:55:19,060 --> 02:55:21,940
Alright, Siggy's calling back. I think he has a question or comment. Hey Siggy, what's

2101
02:55:21,940 --> 02:55:22,940
Hey, what's up?

2102
02:55:22,940 --> 02:55:23,940
Hey, what's up?

2103
02:55:23,940 --> 02:55:26,900
I've forgotten one more thing you mentioned about 2DX8 style.

2104
02:55:26,900 --> 02:55:27,900
Do it.

2105
02:55:27,900 --> 02:55:32,460
Yeah, it's an option called random plus.

2106
02:55:32,460 --> 02:55:33,460
Random plus?

2107
02:55:33,460 --> 02:55:34,460
And what does that do?

2108
02:55:34,460 --> 02:55:40,500
Oh, it's the same thing as random, only you do it, it scratches, it scratches included

2109
02:55:40,500 --> 02:55:41,980
in it.

2110
02:55:41,980 --> 02:55:42,980
Interesting.

2111
02:55:42,980 --> 02:55:43,980
Huh.

2112
02:55:43,980 --> 02:55:44,980
Yeah.

2113
02:55:44,980 --> 02:55:56,980
And the way you access Random Plus is hold the key wherever the random is for at least a few seconds, and the random will turn red.

2114
02:55:56,980 --> 02:55:58,980
Huh, okay.

2115
02:55:58,980 --> 02:56:00,980
And that's how you access Random Plus.

2116
02:56:00,980 --> 02:56:05,980
Yeah, supposedly you have to do something before that, but I'll do that, but I don't know.

2117
02:56:05,980 --> 02:56:07,980
So maybe it's an unlock, we'll see.

2118
02:56:07,980 --> 02:56:10,980
Alright, I'm gonna go and take another call real fast, Ziggybed. Thanks for calling.

2119
02:56:10,980 --> 02:56:11,980
Alright.

2120
02:56:11,980 --> 02:56:12,980
Have a good one.

2121
02:56:12,980 --> 02:56:26,980
Hi, it's MPQ.

2122
02:56:26,980 --> 02:56:29,540
Hello MPQ, what's on your mind?

2123
02:56:29,540 --> 02:56:36,540
I was just wondering if I have any right to complain about 2DX when I have a pop-up music machine within driving distance.

2124
02:56:36,540 --> 02:56:38,100
Um...

2125
02:56:38,100 --> 02:56:41,140
I don't know, what do you guys think? Does he have a right to complain about 2DX?

2126
02:56:41,140 --> 02:56:44,700
What mix of pop-up music is it?

2127
02:56:44,700 --> 02:56:47,700
Well, see, now 5DX is kind of old. I mean, it's good, but it's old.

2128
02:56:47,700 --> 02:56:49,100
Yeah, you can complain.

2129
02:56:49,100 --> 02:56:54,340
I'd say you still have a right to complain, but not as much as the rest of us, okay?

2130
02:56:54,340 --> 02:56:56,020
Alright.

2131
02:56:56,020 --> 02:56:59,860
Have a good one. Bye.

2132
02:56:59,860 --> 02:57:03,300
Alright, we've got to wrap up the show. Sorry to keep these calls quick, but we do need to wrap

2133
02:57:03,300 --> 02:57:07,340
things up, and that means we've got to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

2134
02:57:07,340 --> 02:57:11,220
Arkadian, your final thought?

2135
02:57:11,220 --> 02:57:13,780
Ooh, yay. Horday weekend coming up.

2136
02:57:13,780 --> 02:57:16,700
Did I hear that?

2137
02:57:16,700 --> 02:57:17,420
Uh...

2138
02:57:17,420 --> 02:57:21,860
Explicit, your final thought?

2139
02:57:21,860 --> 02:57:24,660
Ooh, Thanksgiving.

2140
02:57:24,660 --> 02:57:28,460
turkey

2141
02:57:28,460 --> 02:57:33,420
uh... look here but about

2142
02:57:33,420 --> 02:57:36,660
i know there's codes out there i've seen them before

2143
02:57:36,660 --> 02:57:41,020
for grand theft house andrea's re-commodified damage that each gun does

2144
02:57:41,020 --> 02:57:45,940
and i can't find them for the life of me and that pisses me off

2145
02:57:45,940 --> 02:57:48,240
that mom

2146
02:57:48,240 --> 02:57:50,100
yeah i'd need to

2147
02:57:50,100 --> 02:57:53,480
by smart answer the s

2148
02:57:53,480 --> 02:57:59,480
My final thought is, um, I don't want to get up and fly tomorrow. It sucks.

2149
02:57:59,480 --> 02:58:03,480
And you know, I left my email with all my travel information at work.

2150
02:58:03,480 --> 02:58:07,480
But I know what flight I'm on and everything, so hopefully I don't have a problem, or else I'm screwed. We'll see.

2151
02:58:07,480 --> 02:58:08,480
Jamie, your final thought?

2152
02:58:08,480 --> 02:58:14,480
My final thought is, God damn you people, sign up for stuff and give me my iPod.

2153
02:58:14,480 --> 02:58:16,480
Oh God, you didn't get suckered into that too, did you?

2154
02:58:16,480 --> 02:58:20,480
Well, no, it's just because it's an experiment, so I want help.

2155
02:58:20,480 --> 02:58:20,480
Okay.

2156
02:58:20,480 --> 02:58:21,480
You'll help me while you're up?

2157
02:58:21,480 --> 02:58:24,480
No. I don't buy into that shit.

2158
02:58:24,480 --> 02:58:26,480
I'm gonna get my mom to sign up.

2159
02:58:26,480 --> 02:58:28,480
Have fun.

2160
02:58:28,480 --> 02:58:32,480
It's more of an experiment, I don't really care, it's just more of an experiment, just to see.

2161
02:58:32,480 --> 02:58:37,480
Because I found that if you do the Blockbuster thing, you can cancel it before they charge you with anything.

2162
02:58:37,480 --> 02:58:39,480
Yeah, you can.

2163
02:58:39,480 --> 02:58:43,480
I decided it's fun, it's a distraction, so why not?

2164
02:58:43,480 --> 02:58:46,480
Why not? I just don't want spam.

2165
02:58:46,480 --> 02:58:50,480
So, looking forward to going to Alip- oh, this one doesn't give you any spam mail.

2166
02:58:50,480 --> 02:58:54,340
We'll see. I'm looking forward to going to Alabama, getting the hell out of this state.

2167
02:58:54,340 --> 02:59:01,660
Oh, gee, thank you. We'll miss you too. I'm not meaning the people, I'm meaning the other people that don't exist in my universe.

2168
02:59:01,660 --> 02:59:05,180
That's fine. Um, I guess that's it.

2169
02:59:05,180 --> 02:59:09,580
Tune in next week for more fun on the show and hopefully, what I'm kinda hoping

2170
02:59:09,580 --> 02:59:12,620
is that maybe we can get Karaoke Revolution 3 next week because you know

2171
02:59:12,620 --> 02:59:13,700
when Jamie leaves

2172
02:59:13,700 --> 02:59:17,100
Matt has to sing. It's tradition.

2173
02:59:17,100 --> 02:59:23,100
So we'll see what we can do. I'm totally gonna see if Iguana Girl can come over and bring over her copy of Karaoke Revolution 3.

2174
02:59:23,100 --> 02:59:26,100
I'm gonna see if we can work something out. We'll see.

2175
02:59:26,100 --> 02:59:29,100
If not, I'm just gonna go buy the damn thing so we can do that.

2176
02:59:29,100 --> 02:59:32,100
Anyway, thanks everybody for listening. Have a great night.

2177
02:59:32,100 --> 02:59:35,100
The final word of the show. You know what? I'm taking the final word of the show.

2178
02:59:35,100 --> 02:59:38,100
I never get the final word of the show. It's my turn, dammit.

2179
02:59:38,100 --> 02:59:40,100
One word that sums everything up.

2180
02:59:41,100 --> 02:59:43,100
Pictochat.

2181
02:59:43,100 --> 02:59:49,100
That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.

2185
03:00:32,100 --> 03:00:44,100
In the store there's a teddy With little straps, like spaghetti

2186
03:00:44,100 --> 03:00:52,100
It holds me so tight, like handcuffs at night Walk around in women's underwear

2187
03:00:52,100 --> 03:01:00,100
In the office there's a guy named Melvin He pretends that I am Murphy Brown

2188
03:01:00,100 --> 03:01:08,100
He'll say, are you ready? We'll say, whoa, man, let's wait until the wife is out of town.

2189
03:01:08,100 --> 03:01:17,100
Later on, if you wanna, we can dress like my daughter.

2190
03:01:17,100 --> 03:01:21,100
Put on some ice shades and join the parade.

2191
03:01:21,100 --> 03:01:25,100
Walk around and live as underwear.

2192
03:01:25,100 --> 03:01:32,100
Lacy jeans Missed hand, didn't ask

2193
03:01:32,100 --> 03:01:38,100
Urban shine Wearing her clothes, silk pantyhose

2194
03:01:38,100 --> 03:01:42,100
Walking round in women's underwear

2195
03:01:42,100 --> 03:01:47,100
Walking round in women's underwear

2196
03:01:47,100 --> 03:01:54,100
Walkin' round in women's underwear

2197
03:01:54,100 --> 03:02:04,220
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

2198
03:02:24,100 --> 03:02:28,260
the orange lines radio after birth here it is

2199
03:02:28,260 --> 03:02:31,500
Jamie why the Christmas songs already

2200
03:02:31,500 --> 03:02:36,100
because I figured if our major department stores can do it and Walgreens can so can I

2201
03:02:36,100 --> 03:02:39,260
oh my god are they playing Christmas songs at Walgreens already

2202
03:02:39,260 --> 03:02:43,660
it's got the Christmas stuff up

2203
03:02:43,660 --> 03:02:47,140
went to Walmart the other day because we were

2204
03:02:47,140 --> 03:02:50,940
we went to buy go silly headgear and stuff

2205
03:02:50,940 --> 03:02:55,780
and a headgear. Huh? They bought party hats, Care Bears party hats this year.

2206
03:02:55,780 --> 03:02:59,940
Um, but uh, they already had like a whole Christmas section open.

2207
03:02:59,940 --> 03:03:02,940
It was kinda stupid.

2208
03:03:02,940 --> 03:03:08,780
Oh well. And to answer the question in the chat room, yes that was from the Bob and Tom show, right?

2209
03:03:08,780 --> 03:03:14,240
Yes indeed. Right Chan says it's funny to go into Walmart and walk around in the

2210
03:03:14,240 --> 03:03:17,340
women's section looking for stuff. My mom and my dad's just start singing

2211
03:03:17,340 --> 03:03:19,060
walk around in women's underwear.

2212
03:03:19,060 --> 03:03:22,060
Get it? Because you're in the department?

2213
03:03:25,060 --> 03:03:27,060
I thought it was funny.

2214
03:03:27,060 --> 03:03:29,060
It is funny.

2215
03:03:31,060 --> 03:03:35,060
So when do you go on your great adventure, Dark Sakura?

2216
03:03:35,060 --> 03:03:39,060
I'm flying out Wednesday at 2.45. Who wants to drive me to the airport?

2217
03:03:39,060 --> 03:03:42,060
I would, but I'm working.

2218
03:03:42,060 --> 03:03:45,060
I'm still trying to find a way to the airport.

2219
03:03:45,060 --> 03:03:48,820
Oh, shoot. Well, you can always do a shuttle? I don't know.

2220
03:03:48,820 --> 03:03:50,260
I'm working it out, don't worry.

2221
03:03:50,260 --> 03:03:51,940
Okay, that's good.

2222
03:03:51,940 --> 03:03:55,620
Alright, I guess we'll just kind of keep it a short afterbirth tonight then,

2223
03:03:55,620 --> 03:03:59,140
since a lot of you guys don't have anything else to say.

2224
03:03:59,140 --> 03:04:03,620
But, I know we didn't get to a lot of those UltraMix II MP3s,

2225
03:04:03,620 --> 03:04:06,740
so I'm going to put in the rest right now so you guys can hear it,

2226
03:04:06,740 --> 03:04:10,740
because I bet you guys, some of you guys were waiting to hear some of the rest of those songs.

2227
03:04:10,740 --> 03:04:14,020
So we will get to those right now. We're going to start it with Jam on it,

2228
03:04:14,020 --> 03:04:23,020
And La Cucaracha, Life Is A Game, Looking For You, Mellow, Monkey Punk, Play My Game, and Red Room.

2229
03:04:23,020 --> 03:04:27,020
All those songs you're going to hear right now.

2230
03:04:27,020 --> 03:04:32,020
It's a block of Ultramix 2 music. Enjoy, you guys.

2231
03:04:32,020 --> 03:04:36,020
I have to set it up here. Sorry. Here we go. Now we can do it.

2232
03:05:02,020 --> 03:05:06,020
Well damn and honest what we do best is what separates us from the rest

2233
03:05:06,020 --> 03:05:08,020
And if you don't think I cruise down for real

2234
03:05:08,020 --> 03:05:10,020
Let me tell you what happened to the man to see

2235
03:05:10,020 --> 03:05:14,020
A Superman had come to die to see who he could rock

2236
03:05:14,020 --> 03:05:18,020
He blew away every crew he sent until he reached our block

2237
03:05:18,020 --> 03:05:22,020
His speakers were restored and I was what was made of steel

2238
03:05:22,020 --> 03:05:25,020
And when we bought our set outside he said

2239
03:05:25,020 --> 03:05:27,020
I'll be real

2240
03:05:27,020 --> 03:05:29,020
Well Superman looked up at me

2241
03:05:29,020 --> 03:05:31,020
He said you rock so naturally

2242
03:05:31,020 --> 03:05:35,020
I said, now that you've learned the deal, let me tell you why I'm so real.

2243
03:05:35,020 --> 03:05:37,020
I'm Cosmo D from outer space.

2244
03:05:37,020 --> 03:05:39,020
I came to rock for you and great.

2245
03:05:39,020 --> 03:05:40,020
I'm good, right?

2246
03:05:40,020 --> 03:05:41,020
Because I can't do it wrong.

2247
03:05:41,020 --> 03:05:43,020
That's why the whole world is singin' this song.

2248
03:05:43,020 --> 03:05:44,020
Jam on it.

2249
03:05:44,020 --> 03:05:45,020
I jam on it.

2250
03:05:45,020 --> 03:05:47,020
I say jam, j-j-j-jam on it.

2251
03:05:47,020 --> 03:05:51,020
And day to the night and night turns to day, whatever time it is, I wanna hear you say.

2252
03:05:51,020 --> 03:05:52,020
Jam on it.

2253
03:05:52,020 --> 03:05:53,020
I jam on it.

2254
03:05:53,020 --> 03:05:55,020
I say jam, m-m-mama jam on it.

2255
03:05:55,020 --> 03:05:57,020
Jam on around and upside down.

2256
03:05:57,020 --> 03:06:00,020
I keep a jam into the jam on production sound.

2257
03:06:00,020 --> 03:06:05,020
Demone, Demone, Demone, Demone, Demone

2258
03:08:00,020 --> 03:08:07,020
Don't you try to run, don't you try to hide Life is a game, let's play it tonight

2259
03:09:00,020 --> 03:09:18,020
Life is a game, don't want to lie Turn on your flame, let's play tonight

2260
03:09:18,020 --> 03:09:32,020
Don't you try to run, don't you try to hide Life is a game, let's play tonight

2261
03:09:32,020 --> 03:10:00,020
All right, then when I find you, I'll give you love, just a smile, just a smile, I'll

2262
03:10:00,020 --> 03:10:06,820
I'll give you love, it's all the harm you

2263
03:10:06,820 --> 03:10:10,820
I don't wanna make you scream out

2264
03:10:10,820 --> 03:10:14,820
No no no no no, without the count

2265
03:10:14,820 --> 03:10:39,620
We're looking for you in the city We're looking for you tonight, tonight

2266
03:10:39,620 --> 03:10:41,620
Innocent take

2267
03:10:42,620 --> 03:10:43,620
Alright!

2268
03:10:44,620 --> 03:10:47,620
That when I find you I'll get you

2269
03:10:47,620 --> 03:10:48,620
Oh!

2270
03:10:50,620 --> 03:10:52,620
It's all behind you

2271
03:10:52,620 --> 03:10:55,620
I'm gonna make you drink out

2272
03:10:57,620 --> 03:11:00,620
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

2273
03:11:05,620 --> 03:11:07,620
Innocent take

2274
03:11:37,620 --> 03:11:42,620
...

2275
03:11:42,620 --> 03:11:47,620
...

2276
03:11:47,620 --> 03:11:52,620
...

2277
03:11:52,620 --> 03:11:57,620
...

2278
03:11:57,620 --> 03:12:02,620
...

2279
03:12:02,620 --> 03:12:06,620
the

2280
03:12:06,620 --> 03:12:10,620
the

2281
03:12:10,620 --> 03:12:14,620
the

2282
03:12:14,620 --> 03:12:18,620
the

2283
03:12:18,620 --> 03:12:22,620
the

2284
03:12:22,620 --> 03:12:26,620
the

2285
03:12:26,620 --> 03:12:30,620
the

2286
03:13:00,620 --> 03:13:28,620
We didn't have to go too far, we didn't have to go too far.

2287
03:13:28,620 --> 03:13:36,620
First thing first, we got some ice cream And then we headed over to Gee's The Monkey

2288
03:13:36,620 --> 03:13:41,620
Stuck my tongue out and made the monkey frown Tryin' to be cool with my friends around

2289
03:13:41,620 --> 03:13:46,620
But the guess we had, enough of me Cause when I turned my head, he stole my ice cream

2290
03:13:46,620 --> 03:13:51,620
That little monkey stole my ice cream And everybody laughed at me

2291
03:13:51,620 --> 03:13:57,620
That little monkey stole my ice cream And everybody made fun of me

2292
03:13:57,620 --> 03:14:01,620
That little monkey made a monkey out of me

2293
03:14:02,620 --> 03:14:07,620
And the day came to an end We walked right by the monkey again

2294
03:14:07,620 --> 03:14:13,620
And then as we were swinging from tree to tree I swear that monkey was laughing at me

2295
03:14:13,620 --> 03:14:24,620
With a monkey, with a monkey, don't monkey

2296
03:14:24,620 --> 03:14:29,620
That little monkey made a monkey out of me

2297
03:14:29,620 --> 03:14:34,620
That little monkey made a monkey out of me

2298
03:14:34,620 --> 03:14:38,620
with a monkey, with a monkey, no monkey

2299
03:14:38,620 --> 03:14:41,620
with a monkey, no monkey

2300
03:14:41,620 --> 03:14:46,620
with a monkey, that little monkey made a monkey out of me

2301
03:14:46,620 --> 03:14:50,620
Turn the page and rock your body

2302
03:15:20,620 --> 03:15:44,380
Say my name, I feel I'm burning up inside Play my game, I'm losing my mind

2303
03:16:14,380 --> 03:16:40,380
Turn the page and rock your body Turn the page and rock your body

2304

The

2311
03:18:12,380 --> 03:18:37,100
All right, that was all the new DDR UltraMix II songs that we didn't get to during the

2312
03:18:37,100 --> 03:18:38,100
live show tonight.

2313
03:18:38,100 --> 03:18:42,340
Jam on it, La Cucaracha, Life is a Game, look at, excuse me.
