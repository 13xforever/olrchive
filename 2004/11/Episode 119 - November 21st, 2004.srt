[SPEAKER_24]: An exclusive for you guys, the new Ultramix 2 songs.

50
00:04:55,149 --> 00:04:57,291
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm not talking about the same stuff that was on the V-Rare.

51
00:04:57,311 --> 00:04:58,152
[SPEAKER_24]: We already played that.

52
00:04:58,192 --> 00:05:00,775
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm talking about the brand new songs from Ultramix 2.

53
00:05:02,119 --> 00:05:03,840
[SPEAKER_24]: that isn't anywhere else on the internet yet.

54
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:17,226
[SPEAKER_24]: And for instance, in this first break, we're gonna hear Tengoku, or 0.59, both, both, you know the song is both names, the Jesper Kidd mix, and then we're gonna hear the DDR edit of After All, and a new song called Altitude, all from Ultramix 2.

55
00:05:17,826 --> 00:05:20,047
[SPEAKER_24]: We're gonna play a whole lot of new Ultramix 2 songs.

56
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:29,031
[SPEAKER_24]: Ultramix 2 is on everyone's mind this weekend, I think, if you're a DDR player, you've heard about this game, and if you're an Xbox owner, you probably own this game by now.

57
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,300
[SPEAKER_24]: or you're getting it very soon.

58
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:35,302
[SPEAKER_24]: And then, of course, on top of that, we've got all the Japanese imports as well.

59
00:05:35,382 --> 00:05:37,023
[SPEAKER_24]: So, a lot of big news tonight.

60
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:38,983
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll get to all that after this break.

61
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:39,764
[SPEAKER_24]: Let's go to it.

62
00:05:40,604 --> 00:05:45,826
[SPEAKER_24]: Also, whoops, I gotta remember this too, the Akira Omoka signed CD giveaway.

63
00:05:45,866 --> 00:05:47,747
[SPEAKER_24]: Hello, we're giving away the first CD tonight.

64
00:05:48,007 --> 00:05:48,227
[SPEAKER_24]: Who?

65
00:05:50,388 --> 00:05:53,689
[SPEAKER_24]: I would hope you'd know him, seeing as he did the song right before we came on air.

66
00:05:54,189 --> 00:05:56,210
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I lust after his musical talent.

67
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:56,690
[SPEAKER_24]: There you go.

68
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,580
[SPEAKER_24]: There's the Jamie I know.

69
00:05:59,161 --> 00:06:00,841
[SPEAKER_24]: And I lust after his body.

70
00:06:02,482 --> 00:06:03,162
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh my god!

71
00:06:03,762 --> 00:06:05,343
[SPEAKER_24]: Tonight is the night of revelations!

72
00:06:08,104 --> 00:06:09,065
[SPEAKER_25]: And that was just funny.

73
00:06:09,365 --> 00:06:10,925
[SPEAKER_24]: Loki lusts after a man.

74
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:13,286
[SPEAKER_25]: No.

75
00:06:14,147 --> 00:06:14,427
[SPEAKER_25]: No, I don't.

76
00:06:14,467 --> 00:06:17,148
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe that's in the same way I lust after, like, Margaret Cho.

77
00:06:17,688 --> 00:06:19,169
[SPEAKER_25]: You mean he's not a giant robot?

78
00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:22,810
[SPEAKER_24]: In the same way I lust after... I don't know.

79
00:06:23,411 --> 00:06:25,374
[SPEAKER_25]: I lust after teriyaki sauce.

80
00:06:25,434 --> 00:06:25,675
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

81
00:06:25,935 --> 00:06:27,417
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, Benihana teriyaki sauce.

82
00:06:27,457 --> 00:06:28,920
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, the way I lust after that.

83
00:06:29,601 --> 00:06:30,422
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, yeah, sorry.

84
00:06:30,462 --> 00:06:31,023
[SPEAKER_24]: Break time.

85
00:06:33,186 --> 00:06:34,528
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll be right back after this.

86
00:06:34,689 --> 00:06:35,911
[SPEAKER_24]: Music from Ultramix 2.

87
00:06:36,151 --> 00:06:36,712
[SPEAKER_24]: Enjoy, you guys.

88
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:23,353
[SPEAKER_16]: She knows the voices in her mind

89
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:48,230
Thank you for watching!

90
00:09:35,454 --> 00:09:36,220
Thanks for watching!

91
00:10:25,874 --> 00:10:27,037
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks for watching!

92
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,450
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for watching!

93
00:12:05,511 --> 00:12:20,904
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter D, the letter A, and the number 59.

94
00:12:21,004 --> 00:12:26,148
[SPEAKER_16]: Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

95
00:12:26,835 --> 00:12:31,238
[SPEAKER_24]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio episode number 119 on this lovely November 21st, 2004.

96
00:12:31,318 --> 00:12:37,761
[SPEAKER_24]: First off, to those of you guys that are brand new to the station, tuning in for the first time, big welcome to you guys.

97
00:12:37,781 --> 00:12:38,742
[SPEAKER_24]: Welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.

98
00:12:39,122 --> 00:12:47,227
[SPEAKER_24]: I know that our rebroadcasts that are starting now over on DDR Freak on Friday nights are getting a pretty good reception, so I think we might get some new people because of that.

99
00:12:47,687 --> 00:12:52,650
[SPEAKER_24]: So a big thank you to you guys for tuning in over here and listening to the live experience.

100
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:53,390
[SPEAKER_24]: With a shotgun.

101
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:17,652
[SPEAKER_24]: with a BFG for all I care.

102
00:13:19,453 --> 00:13:20,113
[SPEAKER_24]: A pretty gun.

103
00:13:20,613 --> 00:13:23,374
[SPEAKER_24]: Anyway, in there we had some songs from Ultramix 2.

104
00:13:23,734 --> 00:13:25,855
[SPEAKER_24]: Brand new, playing them for the first time.

105
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:29,777
[SPEAKER_24]: Loki and I just were recording those off our Xbox not too long ago.

106
00:13:30,117 --> 00:13:31,418
[SPEAKER_24]: Hope you guys enjoyed it.

107
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:33,479
[SPEAKER_24]: Giving you guys something to check out tonight.

108
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:36,260
[SPEAKER_24]: Those of you guys especially who haven't gotten a chance to check out Ultramix 2,

109
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:38,618
[SPEAKER_24]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

110
00:13:55,555 --> 00:14:04,184
[SPEAKER_24]: You know what's interesting is that a lot of that same feedback in the chatroom, I'm seeing a lot of... Ziz says, it just sucks that they killed Tengoku with this remix.

111
00:14:04,964 --> 00:14:08,908
[SPEAKER_24]: MPQ says, too much kid, not enough Tengoku.

112
00:14:09,369 --> 00:14:10,770
[SPEAKER_24]: Or .59, however you want to say it.

113
00:14:11,151 --> 00:14:17,477
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just... It really was a lot of extraneous stuff that really didn't need to be there.

114
00:14:17,819 --> 00:14:18,340
[SPEAKER_24]: You know what, though?

115
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,522
[SPEAKER_24]: I'll admit, I actually kind of like it.

116
00:14:20,622 --> 00:14:22,103
[SPEAKER_24]: It's like one of my more favorite remixes.

117
00:14:22,443 --> 00:14:30,671
[SPEAKER_24]: It's different, and I can see why people don't like it, because it is so different than the original, and a lot of people consider the original to be like one of the staple Bomani songs.

118
00:14:30,731 --> 00:14:33,994
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, honestly, it's in like every home 2DX version.

119
00:14:34,014 --> 00:14:35,556
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, not every, but almost damn near every.

120
00:14:35,996 --> 00:14:41,562
[SPEAKER_24]: And then, you know, it was a classic DDR song, so it's kind of like when somebody touches that and makes it different, people are kind of nervous.

121
00:14:42,522 --> 00:14:43,703
[SPEAKER_24]: I kind of dug it, though.

122
00:14:43,803 --> 00:14:48,286
[SPEAKER_24]: Certainly more so than a lot of those remixes we got on previous DDR mixes.

123
00:14:48,366 --> 00:14:51,188
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the same thing like what they did with the Battle Royale manga.

124
00:14:51,968 --> 00:14:57,452
[SPEAKER_07]: They took something that was fine the way it was, and blew it way out of proportion by Americanizing the text too much.

125
00:14:58,032 --> 00:14:59,933
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they Americanized the mixing too much in this.

126
00:14:59,993 --> 00:15:02,195
[SPEAKER_07]: It sucks.

127
00:15:02,355 --> 00:15:05,237
[SPEAKER_07]: It's too big, you know?

128
00:15:06,277 --> 00:15:08,759
[SPEAKER_07]: It was fine, simple, the way it was.

129
00:15:09,773 --> 00:15:17,443
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, to each their own opinion, but certainly Ultramix 2 offers something for everyone, so even if you didn't really like that song, maybe you liked After All by Delirium.

130
00:15:17,824 --> 00:15:21,288
[SPEAKER_24]: I would hope that you would like that song, Jamie, considering it was a former cage match pick of yours.

131
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:24,072
[SPEAKER_24]: You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

132
00:15:24,192 --> 00:15:25,574
[SPEAKER_24]: I think she likes that song.

133
00:15:26,254 --> 00:15:27,616
[SPEAKER_24]: What did you guys think of that?

134
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:27,836
[SPEAKER_24]: Arcadian

135
00:15:53,241 --> 00:15:53,902
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

136
00:16:08,457 --> 00:16:09,918
[SPEAKER_24]: Loki, put down the dating sim on the DS for a minute.

137
00:16:35,253 --> 00:16:36,153
[SPEAKER_24]: What do you think of Altitude?

138
00:16:36,173 --> 00:16:38,074
[SPEAKER_24]: That seems like the kind of song you would put in a cage match.

139
00:16:38,114 --> 00:16:38,375
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know.

140
00:16:38,395 --> 00:16:39,195
[SPEAKER_24]: What do you think of Altitude?

141
00:16:39,475 --> 00:16:39,975
[SPEAKER_24]: I liked it.

142
00:16:40,075 --> 00:16:41,416
[SPEAKER_24]: It was cool.

143
00:16:41,436 --> 00:16:42,697
[SPEAKER_22]: Have you played that one on Ultimate X2 yet?

144
00:16:43,137 --> 00:16:44,117
[SPEAKER_24]: I think once.

145
00:16:45,158 --> 00:16:46,138
[SPEAKER_24]: It's different.

146
00:16:46,198 --> 00:16:51,201
[SPEAKER_24]: It's kind of cool because a lot of people are going, oh my god, finally we're getting a US exclusive song that's a 9-footer.

147
00:16:51,721 --> 00:16:55,682
[SPEAKER_24]: Of course, not only is there nine, but there's like ten UX exclusives right now, too.

148
00:16:55,983 --> 00:16:57,463
[SPEAKER_24]: What are you doing over there on the DS?

149
00:16:57,503 --> 00:17:00,684
[SPEAKER_24]: You look like you're scratching off paint or something with your stylus.

150
00:17:01,044 --> 00:17:02,085
[SPEAKER_24]: It's all black.

151
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:06,406
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, you're doing PictoChat and you're just making all black boxes?

152
00:17:07,807 --> 00:17:08,187
[SPEAKER_24]: Lovely.

153
00:17:09,507 --> 00:17:16,110
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, of course, today, the 21st, being the release of the DS as well, and not only Loki, but myself had to go pick up one of these and...

154
00:17:17,873 --> 00:17:19,874
[SPEAKER_24]: I heard they were supposed to be in short supply, but I don't know.

155
00:17:19,894 --> 00:17:21,474
[SPEAKER_24]: It doesn't seem like there was much of a problem.

156
00:17:21,614 --> 00:17:23,035
[SPEAKER_24]: It wasn't that hard to find.

157
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:24,335
[SPEAKER_25]: You guys have DSs?

158
00:17:24,395 --> 00:17:25,375
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, let me get one in the back.

159
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:27,336
[SPEAKER_25]: That was difficult.

160
00:17:27,936 --> 00:17:28,216
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright.

161
00:17:28,536 --> 00:17:33,077
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't want to get too far off base here, because we have to start off the show as we start off every week's show.

162
00:17:33,117 --> 00:17:35,838
[SPEAKER_25]: Did we want to talk, since we brought up Conception?

163
00:17:38,239 --> 00:17:38,459
[SPEAKER_24]: Later.

164
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,139
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll talk about it later.

165
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,040
[SPEAKER_25]: Anyways.

166
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:41,520
[SPEAKER_24]: Anyway.

167
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:45,401
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, we have to get to How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day, because that's an Orange Laundry of Tradition, dammit.

168
00:17:45,461 --> 00:17:45,961
[SPEAKER_24]: So, Jamie...

169
00:17:46,889 --> 00:17:48,630
[SPEAKER_24]: I know you're working over there, but how was your week?

170
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:49,130
[SPEAKER_24]: How was your day?

171
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:50,610
[SPEAKER_07]: My week was shit.

172
00:17:51,651 --> 00:17:52,271
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, I'm sorry.

173
00:17:52,631 --> 00:17:53,852
[SPEAKER_07]: My day was half shit.

174
00:17:59,254 --> 00:18:01,114
[SPEAKER_07]: I normally enjoy being female.

175
00:18:01,675 --> 00:18:02,935
[SPEAKER_07]: This is one of the days I don't.

176
00:18:04,456 --> 00:18:05,976
[SPEAKER_24]: I think I know where this is going, okay?

177
00:18:06,036 --> 00:18:07,197
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to say anything else.

178
00:18:08,197 --> 00:18:10,818
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been in a crappy, crappy mood all day.

179
00:18:11,488 --> 00:18:17,133
[SPEAKER_07]: I overslept, and then it took quite a bit for me to be happy again today.

180
00:18:17,434 --> 00:18:31,707
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I am now in a better mood than I've been all day, thanks to the power of good conversation, and coffee, and salty food.

181
00:18:34,169 --> 00:18:35,550
[SPEAKER_07]: I normally hate salty food.

182
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,272
[SPEAKER_07]: I went out and got me some hot dogs.

183
00:18:39,042 --> 00:18:41,203
[SPEAKER_07]: Super Salty Hot Dogs from the 7-Eleven.

184
00:19:02,242 --> 00:19:04,843
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, the rest of the week was kind of okay.

185
00:19:04,863 --> 00:19:08,165
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been mostly gearing up toward my trip to Alabama.

186
00:19:08,185 --> 00:19:14,829
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to be here next week because I'm going to be in Alabama and not here.

187
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:22,853
[SPEAKER_07]: Although I will have my laptop with me and there may be some Skype potential if I can find a reliable broadband.

188
00:19:23,714 --> 00:19:25,635
[SPEAKER_22]: That's next week's show you're not going to be here?

189
00:19:25,655 --> 00:19:27,676
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm sort of going to be in another state.

190
00:19:28,447 --> 00:19:29,367
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, I know, I know.

191
00:19:29,467 --> 00:19:30,347
[SPEAKER_24]: That happened to me once this year.

192
00:19:30,427 --> 00:19:32,768
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to come back with like a fro because I cut my hair short.

193
00:19:34,008 --> 00:19:35,649
[SPEAKER_07]: And the humidity is going to make it all poof up.

194
00:19:35,829 --> 00:19:36,529
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be funny.

195
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:39,849
[SPEAKER_24]: Are you going to come back with a little bit of southern accent?

196
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,070
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought I already had a bit of one.

197
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:44,290
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not that strong, though.

198
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:47,391
[SPEAKER_07]: I never really had much of one to begin with.

199
00:19:48,371 --> 00:19:55,213
[SPEAKER_07]: And now today, during the show, I'm going to be kind of quiet because I'm doing a paper on a focus on ethics for business law.

200
00:19:56,053 --> 00:19:56,293
[SPEAKER_24]: You?

201
00:19:56,533 --> 00:19:56,893
[SPEAKER_24]: Ethics?

202
00:19:58,254 --> 00:20:00,215
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, you can shut up right now, okay?

203
00:20:00,335 --> 00:20:00,955
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just teasing.

204
00:20:00,975 --> 00:20:01,815
[SPEAKER_07]: I have ethics.

205
00:20:01,975 --> 00:20:03,856
[SPEAKER_07]: I have... some.

206
00:20:04,176 --> 00:20:08,098
[SPEAKER_24]: No, DarkSakura has always been a really good place to go for advice, you know?

207
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:11,639
[SPEAKER_24]: Dear DarkSakura, I'm feeling a little sad today.

208
00:20:12,019 --> 00:20:12,639
[SPEAKER_24]: What should I do?

209
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,120
[SPEAKER_10]: Get the fuck over it!

210
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:15,741
[SPEAKER_24]: Exactly!

211
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:18,362
[SPEAKER_24]: Of course, that's not really ethics, but I don't know.

212
00:20:18,482 --> 00:20:20,742
[SPEAKER_22]: You told me to shut the fuck up, and I feel better already.

213
00:20:20,782 --> 00:20:25,144
[SPEAKER_24]: Dear DarkSakura... Okay, Dear DarkSakura, I stole a dollar out of my mommy's purse.

214
00:20:25,944 --> 00:20:26,565
[SPEAKER_24]: What should I do?

215
00:20:26,745 --> 00:20:27,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Give it to me!

216
00:20:29,053 --> 00:20:29,613
[SPEAKER_24]: There we go.

217
00:20:32,014 --> 00:20:33,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Me and my fucked up morals.

218
00:20:34,354 --> 00:20:40,656
[SPEAKER_07]: But nah, I'm gonna... It's gonna be cool because I'm gonna go see my mama's son.

219
00:20:41,376 --> 00:20:44,337
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm gonna see a bunch of my friends.

220
00:20:45,098 --> 00:20:49,019
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, a few people from DDR Freak are gonna be coming down to see me.

221
00:20:49,619 --> 00:20:50,259
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay, Freak!

222
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,080
[SPEAKER_07]: And I figure maybe I'll get some interviews or something.

223
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,181
[SPEAKER_07]: Or a statement from various people's.

224
00:20:57,509 --> 00:20:57,990
[SPEAKER_24]: Please do.

225
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:02,697
[SPEAKER_24]: We do want some statements on record from some of our pals in Alabama and the surrounding areas.

226
00:21:03,999 --> 00:21:06,843
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's pretty much it.

227
00:21:08,285 --> 00:21:08,706
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright.

228
00:21:08,886 --> 00:21:09,387
[SPEAKER_24]: Sounds good to me.

229
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:14,579
[SPEAKER_24]: I prefer to call those make fun of the customer buttons.

230
00:21:38,885 --> 00:21:41,325
[SPEAKER_24]: See, unfortunately, we don't have make fun of the listener buttons.

231
00:21:41,565 --> 00:21:43,106
[SPEAKER_24]: So, you know, we don't have that.

232
00:21:43,126 --> 00:21:44,166
[SPEAKER_24]: We can't afford cough buttons.

233
00:21:44,486 --> 00:21:47,907
[SPEAKER_24]: So if I just cough in your ear and blow out your speaker, my apologies.

234
00:21:47,987 --> 00:21:48,447
[SPEAKER_24]: But I'm sick.

235
00:21:48,467 --> 00:21:48,727
[SPEAKER_24]: Get over it.

236
00:21:48,747 --> 00:21:49,587
[SPEAKER_25]: I totally agree with you, Rob.

237
00:21:49,647 --> 00:21:49,927
[SPEAKER_25]: Click.

238
00:21:49,967 --> 00:21:51,187
[SPEAKER_25]: Those listeners are stupid.

239
00:21:51,247 --> 00:21:51,547
[SPEAKER_25]: Click.

240
00:21:53,968 --> 00:21:54,328
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, wait.

241
00:21:55,608 --> 00:21:56,008
[SPEAKER_25]: Just kidding.

242
00:21:56,128 --> 00:21:56,408
[SPEAKER_24]: Click.

243
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:56,768
[SPEAKER_24]: Shut up.

244
00:21:56,788 --> 00:21:58,228
[SPEAKER_24]: We get a dollar for everyone that listens.

245
00:21:58,288 --> 00:21:58,548
[SPEAKER_24]: Click.

246
00:21:59,309 --> 00:21:59,689
[SPEAKER_24]: Just kidding.

247
00:21:59,729 --> 00:21:59,989
[SPEAKER_24]: I wish.

248
00:22:00,309 --> 00:22:00,569
[SPEAKER_24]: All right.

249
00:22:00,829 --> 00:22:01,609
[SPEAKER_24]: Loki, how was your week?

250
00:22:01,629 --> 00:22:02,029
[SPEAKER_24]: How was your day?

251
00:22:02,729 --> 00:22:03,489
[SPEAKER_25]: My week was all right.

252
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:05,030
[SPEAKER_25]: It was pretty uneventful.

253
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,970
[SPEAKER_25]: I tried playing Grand Theft Auto.

254
00:22:07,896 --> 00:22:16,883
[SPEAKER_25]: MyStyle, which includes cheating, and my GameShark 2 crapped out on me, so I bought a new codebreaker today.

255
00:22:16,963 --> 00:22:18,444
[SPEAKER_24]: Cheaters never prosper.

256
00:22:18,945 --> 00:22:24,409
[SPEAKER_25]: No, shitty software... Oh, what do you mean, cheaters never prosper?

257
00:22:24,489 --> 00:22:25,390
[SPEAKER_25]: Bush got elected.

258
00:22:26,671 --> 00:22:31,255
[SPEAKER_25]: Anyways, so... Wow.

259
00:22:31,775 --> 00:22:35,398
[SPEAKER_25]: Anyways, so... Today, we got...

260
00:22:36,144 --> 00:22:36,825
[SPEAKER_25]: DM DM DM DM DM DM

261
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:52,031
[SPEAKER_25]: Literally six feet away.

262
00:22:52,191 --> 00:22:52,391
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

263
00:22:53,051 --> 00:22:53,771
[SPEAKER_24]: Not even six feet.

264
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:59,334
[SPEAKER_24]: Loki was sitting on the couch, which you can see on cam, and I was sitting in the Jamie's seat, which you can't see on cam, but it's really close.

265
00:22:59,974 --> 00:23:01,415
[SPEAKER_25]: On the other side of the coffee table.

266
00:23:01,435 --> 00:23:11,620
[SPEAKER_24]: We were playing PictoChat and writing dirty words like vagina and things on the PictoChat and drawing middle fingers to each other and stuff, and it was hilarious.

267
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,961
[SPEAKER_24]: This is what the DS was made for.

268
00:23:12,981 --> 00:23:14,581
[SPEAKER_25]: I love the DS just for that.

269
00:23:15,322 --> 00:23:18,023
[SPEAKER_25]: That is the best feature right now.

270
00:23:18,533 --> 00:23:29,444
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, actually, it was really cool, because we were playing Metroid Prime Hunters at the demo at Best Buy, and I gotta say, the control on it's awesome.

271
00:23:29,524 --> 00:23:31,406
[SPEAKER_25]: It's just really smart.

272
00:23:31,446 --> 00:23:32,467
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm having issues with it.

273
00:23:32,848 --> 00:23:33,688
[SPEAKER_24]: It's too much for me.

274
00:23:34,725 --> 00:23:36,586
[SPEAKER_24]: I miss my Atari joystick, okay?

275
00:23:37,066 --> 00:23:37,546
[SPEAKER_24]: One button!

276
00:23:38,147 --> 00:23:39,147
[SPEAKER_24]: One button for everything!

277
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:55,175
[SPEAKER_25]: Now, now, I like it, I like it, but it cramps up my hand like a bitch because you have to hold it in a really weird way, and so, like, my finger's all fucked up from trying to reach around to the back to, you know, push the, uh, L button, and it's just like... Sounds dirty.

278
00:23:55,255 --> 00:23:56,715
[SPEAKER_24]: Can't quite get the reach around, huh?

279
00:23:57,976 --> 00:24:02,238
[SPEAKER_25]: I guess, yeah, whatever, anyways, um, so, other than that, um...

280
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:04,352
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know, what else did I do?

281
00:24:04,672 --> 00:24:06,913
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, we went to Benny Hoff's today and that rocked.

282
00:24:07,353 --> 00:24:14,717
[SPEAKER_25]: Because we were going to go to some cheapo teriyaki bowl place and they ended up not being open on Sunday.

283
00:24:14,737 --> 00:24:16,238
[SPEAKER_24]: What kind of restaurant is closed on Sunday?

284
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:17,779
[SPEAKER_25]: Religious restaurants?

285
00:24:17,979 --> 00:24:18,439
[SPEAKER_07]: Chick-fil-A.

286
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,321
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously?

287
00:24:20,381 --> 00:24:21,601
[SPEAKER_24]: I know Chick-fil-A is closed on Sunday.

288
00:24:21,621 --> 00:24:22,822
[SPEAKER_24]: They don't have Chick-fil-A here though.

289
00:24:23,302 --> 00:24:24,343
[SPEAKER_07]: They have one in Solano.

290
00:24:24,923 --> 00:24:25,583
[SPEAKER_24]: That's not here.

291
00:24:25,604 --> 00:24:27,384
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to go eat at Chick-fil-A in Alabama.

292
00:24:27,605 --> 00:24:28,105
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, done.

293
00:24:30,862 --> 00:24:35,544
[SPEAKER_24]: Anyways, so... Well, yeah, well, I'm going to go to South Sac and eat at Popeye's, dodgeball.

294
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:37,804
[SPEAKER_07]: I could eat at five Popeye's in Mobile.

295
00:24:38,705 --> 00:24:39,045
[SPEAKER_24]: Sorry, Logie.

296
00:24:39,065 --> 00:24:41,025
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, sorry, but not really.

297
00:24:44,046 --> 00:24:48,948
[SPEAKER_25]: So, anyways, so, yeah, it's pretty much a lot of Final Fantasy.

298
00:24:49,348 --> 00:24:52,949
[SPEAKER_25]: I've leveled my white mage up, like, five levels or so.

299
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:54,230
[SPEAKER_25]: Addict.

300
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:55,810
[SPEAKER_25]: And, um...

301
00:24:59,113 --> 00:24:59,473
[SPEAKER_25]: What else?

302
00:25:00,494 --> 00:25:02,014
[SPEAKER_25]: Not really much else other than that.

303
00:25:02,575 --> 00:25:05,616
[SPEAKER_25]: We got Ultramix 2, so I watch people play that.

304
00:25:06,216 --> 00:25:10,958
[SPEAKER_25]: And that's pretty much it for right now, yeah.

305
00:25:11,158 --> 00:25:11,579
[SPEAKER_25]: I think so.

306
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:12,939
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright.

307
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,921
[SPEAKER_24]: RKDN42, how was your week?

308
00:25:15,941 --> 00:25:16,301
[SPEAKER_24]: How was your day?

309
00:25:17,121 --> 00:25:18,362
[SPEAKER_06]: My week was kind of eh.

310
00:25:19,082 --> 00:25:22,183
[SPEAKER_06]: I was sick most of the week with a cold, but it was working.

311
00:25:22,223 --> 00:25:23,664
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't that bad.

312
00:25:23,684 --> 00:25:28,066
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just sniffly all week and so forth, and it did work.

313
00:25:28,885 --> 00:25:34,309
[SPEAKER_06]: Then, went on Tuesday, went and got my smog test for my car, so I can get full registration.

314
00:25:35,069 --> 00:25:43,815
[SPEAKER_06]: Then, after doing that on Thursday, I went down to the courthouse to see if I could pay off my ticket for the registration thing, hopefully.

315
00:25:44,135 --> 00:25:47,657
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh yes, and that was the one you got after this show, a couple weeks ago, yes, alright.

316
00:25:48,418 --> 00:25:56,743
[SPEAKER_06]: But you said that I need the final registration, or have to go to DMV or something, so they extended the date, so I have until next month to get all that done.

317
00:25:57,574 --> 00:26:00,996
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully that will still be corrected and I only have to pay $10.

318
00:26:01,076 --> 00:26:04,739
[SPEAKER_06]: I said $191, which would be a bitch if I had to do that.

319
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:11,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Then I paid some 2DX this week and ordered 8th Style on Wednesday.

320
00:26:11,764 --> 00:26:13,705
[SPEAKER_22]: You're going to get 8th Style before me, Cry?

321
00:26:13,725 --> 00:26:16,867
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well it's probably going to be like two weeks or so, I don't know.

322
00:26:17,127 --> 00:26:20,890
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I ordered from YesAsia and they don't have them in stock at the moment.

323
00:26:21,331 --> 00:26:25,555
[SPEAKER_24]: I definitely want to play some of the 8th style consumer stuff tonight because there's a song on there I love so much.

324
00:26:25,575 --> 00:26:27,876
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to be getting mine from PlayAsia.

325
00:26:28,237 --> 00:26:29,938
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody's getting 8th style but me crying.

326
00:26:29,958 --> 00:26:31,199
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just going to be getting it for Christmas.

327
00:26:31,239 --> 00:26:33,541
[SPEAKER_07]: And I still don't have 7th style crying.

328
00:26:33,962 --> 00:26:39,366
[SPEAKER_07]: It's either 8th style or I think I'm getting a tablet because I'm changing my major to an art major.

329
00:26:39,826 --> 00:26:40,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

330
00:26:40,047 --> 00:26:43,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

331
00:26:43,509 --> 00:26:44,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't do much else.

332
00:26:45,071 --> 00:26:46,332
[SPEAKER_06]: Played a bit more 2DX today.

333
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:47,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Came here yesterday and

334
00:26:48,243 --> 00:26:49,444
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Spring of Trivia!

335
00:27:16,377 --> 00:27:25,283
[SPEAKER_25]: Spike TV is the most intelligent station I've ever seen because they are bringing... You said Spike TV and intelligent in the same sentence.

336
00:27:25,463 --> 00:27:30,766
[SPEAKER_25]: Listen, they have a good video game awards show and they're bringing Japanese game shows over here to America.

337
00:27:30,887 --> 00:27:33,488
[SPEAKER_24]: And reruns of Blind Date 24 hours a day.

338
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:34,129
[SPEAKER_25]: Exactly!

339
00:27:34,169 --> 00:27:35,109
[SPEAKER_25]: That fucking rocks!

340
00:27:35,329 --> 00:27:36,430
[SPEAKER_25]: And you know what else they have?

341
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:38,952
[SPEAKER_25]: World's Wildest Police Chases.

342
00:27:39,012 --> 00:27:40,733
[SPEAKER_25]: And we watch that every fucking day.

343
00:27:41,253 --> 00:27:42,114
[SPEAKER_25]: And that's awesome.

344
00:27:42,574 --> 00:27:44,516
[SPEAKER_25]: So they have really kick-ass TV.

345
00:27:44,836 --> 00:27:44,996
[SPEAKER_25]: But...

346
00:27:45,596 --> 00:28:08,216
[SPEAKER_25]: Hey Spring of Trivia, it's the weirdest show you'll ever see, it's just a trivia show, it's not really a game show And the winners at the end, they win bread Sounds like one of our giveaways And it's great though because one of the trivia things was Mozart wrote a song called Lick My Ass

347
00:28:09,033 --> 00:28:17,201
[SPEAKER_25]: And he actually did write a song called Lick My Ass And then they performed the song Lick My Ass Which was translated into English And it was great, it was like um

348
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:21,011
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, wonderful sensation, lick my ass.

349
00:28:23,633 --> 00:28:24,133
[SPEAKER_25]: It was great.

350
00:28:24,693 --> 00:28:28,295
[SPEAKER_25]: You just have to watch that show, it's great.

351
00:28:28,355 --> 00:28:39,379
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what, having taken quite a bit of music history, when I first started college, because I started off as a music major, that doesn't surprise me one single bit.

352
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:42,741
[SPEAKER_24]: You know what, Vox said it right though.

353
00:28:44,724 --> 00:28:46,705
[SPEAKER_24]: Lick My Ass is a wonderful sensation.

354
00:28:47,345 --> 00:28:47,625
[SPEAKER_24]: No.

355
00:28:49,145 --> 00:28:49,685
[SPEAKER_23]: Mozart.

356
00:28:49,765 --> 00:28:50,625
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, Mozart.

357
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:51,066
[SPEAKER_23]: Never mind.

358
00:28:51,786 --> 00:28:52,246
[SPEAKER_23]: Whoever.

359
00:28:52,946 --> 00:28:53,666
[SPEAKER_23]: The dead guy.

360
00:28:54,226 --> 00:29:06,089
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, that's what... See, Taka needs to now, you know, take that song and, you know, put it into, like, another renaissance song for, like, you know, 2DX Blue or whatever the next one's gonna be.

361
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:07,970
[SPEAKER_25]: Gold.

362
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:09,350
[SPEAKER_25]: Anyways.

363
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:10,070
[SPEAKER_25]: 2DX Yellow.

364
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:11,631
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, and one more thing.

365
00:29:11,851 --> 00:29:12,591
[SPEAKER_25]: This will be the last thing.

366
00:29:13,987 --> 00:29:14,748
[SPEAKER_25]: DERBY OWNERS CLUB

367
00:29:35,342 --> 00:29:37,663
[SPEAKER_24]: For once, we have the cool game on the block.

368
00:29:37,683 --> 00:29:39,124
[SPEAKER_24]: Actually, we have Disney's Rave, too, for weather.

369
00:29:39,424 --> 00:29:41,605
[SPEAKER_24]: But for twice, we have the cool game on the block.

370
00:29:41,865 --> 00:29:44,166
[SPEAKER_24]: I really, really hope they can keep it in good shape this time.

371
00:29:44,326 --> 00:29:45,887
[SPEAKER_07]: I gave poop to a small child.

372
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,817
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, the coin slots are a little iffy.

373
00:29:48,857 --> 00:29:49,278
[SPEAKER_24]: Wait, wait, wait.

374
00:29:49,558 --> 00:29:51,119
[SPEAKER_24]: How did you give poop to a small child?

375
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:55,362
[SPEAKER_07]: I bred some of Iguana Girl's horses because I missed having my specials.

376
00:29:55,743 --> 00:29:58,245
[SPEAKER_07]: The first one I built was an albino, so I named it Shiroi.

377
00:29:58,265 --> 00:29:59,065
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a female.

378
00:30:01,167 --> 00:30:05,470
[SPEAKER_07]: If it was a male, I would have named it Michael Jackson or something because I think its parent was Latoya Jackson.

379
00:30:05,851 --> 00:30:07,332
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

380
00:30:08,012 --> 00:30:09,714
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it was one of her half-and-halves.

381
00:30:09,754 --> 00:30:13,096
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, my second one came out all gray, so I named him Poop.

382
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,138
[SPEAKER_07]: And I gave him to a small child.

383
00:30:16,391 --> 00:30:19,672
[SPEAKER_07]: and then my last one was a panda, so I named it Gungurl.

384
00:30:21,233 --> 00:30:22,953
[SPEAKER_24]: Here, have some poop, little child.

385
00:30:23,854 --> 00:30:24,854
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you should have seen the kid.

386
00:30:24,874 --> 00:30:26,695
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, here, I named my horse Poop.

387
00:30:26,715 --> 00:30:27,335
[SPEAKER_07]: You can have him.

388
00:30:27,375 --> 00:30:28,355
[SPEAKER_07]: And the kid just grinned.

389
00:30:32,537 --> 00:30:33,377
[SPEAKER_07]: I got poop!

390
00:30:35,198 --> 00:30:37,539
[SPEAKER_07]: He just had that hey, hey, hey grin.

391
00:30:37,899 --> 00:30:40,340
[SPEAKER_22]: Can you imagine the parents getting the phone call?

392
00:30:41,653 --> 00:30:44,355
[SPEAKER_22]: Could you tell your child not to bring poop to school again?

393
00:30:46,076 --> 00:30:46,376
[SPEAKER_22]: Sorry.

394
00:30:48,138 --> 00:30:51,200
[SPEAKER_25]: But yeah, we gotta start him young in the life of horse racing.

395
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,061
[SPEAKER_25]: And, you know, betting on tracks.

396
00:30:55,243 --> 00:30:56,324
[SPEAKER_25]: Anyways, I'm done.

397
00:30:56,364 --> 00:30:57,244
[SPEAKER_24]: Go, baby, go!

398
00:30:57,825 --> 00:31:01,888
[SPEAKER_24]: Explicit joined us during that first commercial break, and you know he's always got a lot to say.

399
00:31:02,948 --> 00:31:03,309
[SPEAKER_24]: What's up?

400
00:31:03,349 --> 00:31:03,789
[SPEAKER_24]: How was your week?

401
00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:04,269
[SPEAKER_24]: How was your day?

402
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:05,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good.

403
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:08,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Had to take a few tests this week.

404
00:31:09,013 --> 00:31:10,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Practically passed all of them.

405
00:31:11,932 --> 00:31:15,033
[SPEAKER_03]: and I actually finally played Derby's Owners Club at RVGL.

406
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:16,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Go, baby, go!

407
00:31:17,253 --> 00:31:18,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Go, baby, go!

408
00:31:19,153 --> 00:31:21,254
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's about time RVGL got onto my good side.

409
00:31:23,034 --> 00:31:23,314
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

410
00:31:23,434 --> 00:31:25,295
[SPEAKER_24]: I still haven't gone there yet.

411
00:31:25,355 --> 00:31:26,395
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm still a little scared.

412
00:31:27,255 --> 00:31:29,656
[SPEAKER_24]: That place, Bomani Games go and they die there.

413
00:31:30,056 --> 00:31:35,557
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm scared that when I go there, Derby Owners Club is going to have like two monitors missing and it's going to make me cry.

414
00:31:35,677 --> 00:31:38,697
[SPEAKER_03]: Or kids stealing the... Or kids breaking all the TV.

415
00:31:39,458 --> 00:31:39,938
[SPEAKER_24]: Seriously.

416
00:31:40,358 --> 00:31:41,538
[SPEAKER_24]: Graffiti or something, I don't know.

417
00:31:41,897 --> 00:31:43,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and finally got the DS.

418
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,301
[SPEAKER_24]: You too, huh?

419
00:31:47,181 --> 00:31:49,143
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the pictograph.

420
00:31:49,163 --> 00:31:56,669
[SPEAKER_24]: Were you here when we were talking about how Loki and I were sitting just six feet from each other, writing vagina and sending middle finger pictures back and forth?

421
00:31:56,709 --> 00:31:57,369
[SPEAKER_03]: I just got here.

422
00:31:59,051 --> 00:32:01,213
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm hiding right now with my fuck you hat.

423
00:32:02,814 --> 00:32:04,315
[SPEAKER_24]: You have to put that on cam so they can see.

424
00:32:04,375 --> 00:32:11,061
[SPEAKER_24]: Cam over at www.orangenautorated.com If you can't see the hat that Explicit is wearing, it says fuck you in sign language.

425
00:32:11,221 --> 00:32:11,601
[SPEAKER_24]: It's pretty nice.

426
00:32:12,625 --> 00:32:13,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

427
00:32:14,426 --> 00:32:14,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

428
00:32:14,846 --> 00:32:16,127
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now I have metric point hunters.

429
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:17,588
[SPEAKER_03]: It feels pretty good so far.

430
00:32:17,608 --> 00:32:19,889
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just hard to get used to, really.

431
00:32:20,109 --> 00:32:21,970
[SPEAKER_24]: Are you having problems with the reach around like Loki is?

432
00:32:22,951 --> 00:32:23,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Not really.

433
00:32:23,291 --> 00:32:24,491
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually got used to it very quickly.

434
00:32:24,892 --> 00:32:25,152
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

435
00:32:26,052 --> 00:32:26,512
[SPEAKER_03]: I can shoot.

436
00:32:26,893 --> 00:32:30,254
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just shooting is the big problem.

437
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:30,935
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the only thing.

438
00:32:33,216 --> 00:32:33,736
[SPEAKER_03]: That is all.

439
00:32:36,018 --> 00:32:37,318
[SPEAKER_25]: Sorry.

440
00:32:38,679 --> 00:32:41,040
[SPEAKER_25]: Does everything have to be about gay sex, really?

441
00:32:43,331 --> 00:32:43,771
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes!

442
00:32:43,791 --> 00:32:49,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you're making me think DS stands for dual sexuality.

443
00:32:49,754 --> 00:32:53,336
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought DS stood for me!

444
00:32:54,956 --> 00:32:55,677
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck y'all!

445
00:32:56,737 --> 00:32:57,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

446
00:32:58,578 --> 00:33:02,420
[SPEAKER_24]: I have no other real material tonight, so I resort to Dick Fargage sex jokes.

447
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,100
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry, you guys.

448
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,681
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, how does it feel to have... I'm offended.

449
00:33:05,721 --> 00:33:06,502
[SPEAKER_22]: I need to sue.

450
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:07,122
[SPEAKER_22]: How does...

451
00:33:07,967 --> 00:33:10,069
[SPEAKER_24]: Go ahead, you ain't gonna get blood out of a turnip, honey.

452
00:33:11,129 --> 00:33:11,910
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, you mean the DS?

453
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,852
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, I thought you meant me, my dick and fart and gay sex jokes.

454
00:33:13,892 --> 00:33:14,152
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

455
00:33:14,452 --> 00:33:14,552
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh.

456
00:33:15,373 --> 00:33:16,253
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm offended!

457
00:33:16,273 --> 00:33:18,775
[SPEAKER_24]: How does it feel to have a game system named after you?

458
00:33:20,116 --> 00:33:24,239
[SPEAKER_07]: My ego is gargantuan, like the size of the King of All Cosmos' package.

459
00:33:26,881 --> 00:33:32,886
[SPEAKER_07]: I have decided, by the way, speaking of that, that I'm going to cosplay as the Little Prince, with a big ball of stuff.

460
00:33:34,908 --> 00:33:36,629
[SPEAKER_24]: I should cosplay as the King, that would rock.

461
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:39,142
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, actually I forgot I did do something else yesterday.

462
00:33:40,063 --> 00:33:41,284
[SPEAKER_07]: I went to the Wreck-It-Con kickoff.

463
00:33:41,564 --> 00:33:42,044
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, how was that?

464
00:33:42,445 --> 00:33:43,906
[SPEAKER_07]: It was pretty good.

465
00:33:44,066 --> 00:33:45,788
[SPEAKER_24]: What is Wreck-It-Con for those who don't live in California?

466
00:33:45,808 --> 00:33:50,151
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a local anime con, one of the smaller ones at one of the schools in Pittsburgh, California.

467
00:33:51,192 --> 00:33:52,533
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was pretty cool.

468
00:33:52,573 --> 00:33:53,314
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a good time.

469
00:33:53,554 --> 00:33:54,835
[SPEAKER_24]: I want to go again this year.

470
00:33:54,955 --> 00:33:56,236
[SPEAKER_24]: They moved the date though, didn't they?

471
00:33:56,757 --> 00:33:57,237
[SPEAKER_07]: March, I think.

472
00:33:57,517 --> 00:33:57,898
[SPEAKER_24]: I want to go.

473
00:33:58,398 --> 00:34:01,481
[SPEAKER_07]: But I got a fantasy star online art book.

474
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:05,244
[SPEAKER_07]: I picked up a record, which I need to bring over here to rip the audio from.

475
00:34:05,802 --> 00:34:06,723
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

476
00:34:26,241 --> 00:34:27,543
[SPEAKER_24]: Ask Orange Lounge Live

477
00:34:39,392 --> 00:34:40,032
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll talk to him.

478
00:34:40,192 --> 00:34:40,672
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, cool.

479
00:34:41,032 --> 00:34:45,354
[SPEAKER_07]: But I just, you know, seeing all the costumes, I was like, you know what, that's what I should do.

480
00:34:45,414 --> 00:34:49,875
[SPEAKER_07]: And someone suggested, by the way, I got a free copy of The Sims 2, which I'm giving to Iguana Girl.

481
00:34:51,155 --> 00:34:57,337
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm going to be, he gave me some ideas for a skit I can do for The Masquerade.

482
00:34:58,934 --> 00:35:03,516
[SPEAKER_07]: And that would be put little Lego houses and stuff on the ground and roll over it with a giant ball.

483
00:35:03,776 --> 00:35:07,737
[SPEAKER_07]: They have this big display behind me that sees legs in this humongous package.

484
00:35:10,238 --> 00:35:10,498
[SPEAKER_24]: Awesome.

485
00:35:10,718 --> 00:35:15,300
[SPEAKER_24]: You know if they do put Katamari Damacy on the DS, the king will have to be both screens.

486
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,500
[SPEAKER_24]: His package will take up the entire lower screen.

487
00:35:17,941 --> 00:35:18,861
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be awesome.

488
00:35:19,741 --> 00:35:27,764
[SPEAKER_07]: Although I'm wondering how one so endowed could come out with something so tiny.

489
00:35:29,051 --> 00:35:31,953
[SPEAKER_06]: I should be getting the game, the Japanese version, in a day or two.

490
00:35:33,694 --> 00:35:35,716
[SPEAKER_06]: Got it off eBay for about the same price as it cost me.

491
00:35:35,916 --> 00:35:37,277
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh wait, so you bought the Japanese version?

492
00:35:37,557 --> 00:35:37,757
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

493
00:35:37,857 --> 00:35:38,317
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, very cool.

494
00:35:39,158 --> 00:35:42,960
[SPEAKER_24]: Of course, they didn't change much, so, except the words, but hey.

495
00:35:43,801 --> 00:35:45,782
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright, my week and my day was pretty good.

496
00:35:46,203 --> 00:35:48,864
[SPEAKER_24]: I didn't do a whole lot of Bomani playing, well, except for Ultramix 2.

497
00:35:48,904 --> 00:35:52,567
[SPEAKER_24]: I've actually done a lot of DDR playing in the past three days, but I'll get into that a little bit later.

498
00:35:53,047 --> 00:35:57,030
[SPEAKER_24]: I did not go out to Roseville Golf Land with the others on, what, like Wednesday or something?

499
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:57,090
[SPEAKER_24]: No.

500
00:35:57,731 --> 00:35:59,873
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know, I was supposed to go on a date the other night and I got ditched.

501
00:36:00,053 --> 00:36:02,216
[SPEAKER_24]: So, you know, life sucks sometimes, but what can you do?

502
00:36:02,757 --> 00:36:05,280
[SPEAKER_24]: Although, I got an apology today, so that made me feel a little better.

503
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:10,826
[SPEAKER_24]: And one of my really, really good friends is in the hospital for the second time this week.

504
00:36:11,006 --> 00:36:15,111
[SPEAKER_24]: So, Christopher, I know you're not listening, but I'm thinking about you and I hope you feel better soon.

505
00:36:16,653 --> 00:36:17,114
[SPEAKER_24]: Also...

506
00:36:18,815 --> 00:36:22,816
[SPEAKER_24]: I went and got the DS with Matt today and I've been really enjoying that as well.

507
00:36:22,916 --> 00:36:25,498
[SPEAKER_24]: And Benihana is one thing that Loki didn't say about Benihana.

508
00:36:25,518 --> 00:36:26,658
[SPEAKER_24]: That was only my second time there.

509
00:36:27,098 --> 00:36:28,959
[SPEAKER_24]: But you know what's really weird about when you go to Benihana?

510
00:36:28,979 --> 00:36:31,640
[SPEAKER_24]: When you go to most restaurants, you sit at your own table, right?

511
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:39,044
[SPEAKER_24]: But at Benihana, you kind of have to like share a table with other people because they sit like seven or eight people at a table because of the fact they only have so many chefs.

512
00:36:39,884 --> 00:36:40,785
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you for watching!

513
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:05,612
[SPEAKER_24]: So, of course, we want to talk a whole lot about Ultramix 2.

514
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:08,914
[SPEAKER_24]: We want to get your input over the Skype line.

515
00:37:08,954 --> 00:37:12,717
[SPEAKER_24]: If you go over to www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on Interact With Us.

516
00:37:13,077 --> 00:37:14,779
[SPEAKER_24]: We're going to take some of your calls in a little bit.

517
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:16,280
[SPEAKER_24]: But first, let's go to a break.

518
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,141
[SPEAKER_24]: We still have a lot of music going to play for you guys tonight.

519
00:37:18,201 --> 00:37:22,344
[SPEAKER_24]: As I said earlier in the show, we've got so many Ultramix 2 songs we want to debut for you guys tonight.

520
00:37:23,105 --> 00:37:30,830
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't think anybody else has these right now, so we're playing them for you guys and getting your thoughts on it as well over the Skype line.

521
00:37:30,971 --> 00:37:32,652
[SPEAKER_24]: And we'll talk about Ultramix 2 when we come back.

522
00:37:33,092 --> 00:37:34,913
[SPEAKER_24]: From this, you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

523
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:37,815
This is how the story goes

524
00:38:07,123 --> 00:38:07,524
[SPEAKER_16]: and many more.

525
00:38:31,857 --> 00:38:32,977
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for watching!

526
00:38:58,257 --> 00:39:00,179
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for watching!

527
00:39:49,047 --> 00:39:57,249
Let me tell you something you don't know Let me tell you something you don't know

528
00:40:19,637 --> 00:40:23,386
[SPEAKER_16]: Let me tell you something you don't know

529
00:42:48,741 --> 00:42:49,962
[SPEAKER_23]: Orange Lounge Radio.

530
00:42:50,302 --> 00:42:56,466
[SPEAKER_23]: We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.

531
00:42:57,827 --> 00:42:59,929
[SPEAKER_24]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

532
00:42:59,969 --> 00:43:01,910
[SPEAKER_24]: Hope you enjoyed some of the music there in that break.

533
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:02,831
[SPEAKER_24]: All from Ultramix 2.

534
00:43:03,031 --> 00:43:07,574
[SPEAKER_24]: We had a song, you should know this one, Brick House by the Commodores.

535
00:43:07,734 --> 00:43:09,355
[SPEAKER_24]: Finally making its way into a DDR game.

536
00:43:09,375 --> 00:43:09,935
[SPEAKER_24]: That's a great one.

537
00:43:10,656 --> 00:43:16,900
[SPEAKER_24]: After that was a group called Creo with a song called Burning For You, which is kind of a, I think it's one of the sleeper hits of the mix, honestly.

538
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:17,580
[SPEAKER_24]: It's one of those songs.

539
00:43:19,198 --> 00:43:20,179
[SPEAKER_24]: Catch It by Total Science

540
00:43:35,495 --> 00:43:38,097
[SPEAKER_24]: which is a song I don't particularly care for so much.

541
00:43:38,498 --> 00:43:43,863
[SPEAKER_24]: And DarkSakura is discovering the wonders of pictochat with Loki on the DS right now.

542
00:43:43,883 --> 00:43:44,904
[SPEAKER_24]: What are you guys drawing pictures of?

543
00:43:44,944 --> 00:43:46,685
[SPEAKER_07]: My artwork is pretty damn good on this thing.

544
00:43:47,146 --> 00:43:48,186
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to put it up on the cam.

545
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:50,188
[SPEAKER_24]: You can try, but it looks really blurry.

546
00:43:50,629 --> 00:43:52,891
[SPEAKER_24]: I can go try to put it up on the cam, but you're going to have to chat while I do it.

547
00:43:52,911 --> 00:43:55,033
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

548
00:43:55,053 --> 00:44:01,919
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to... I drew a picture of a toilet.

549
00:44:06,738 --> 00:44:09,241
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you can barely see it, but it's coming out okay.

550
00:44:10,282 --> 00:44:17,750
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki sent me a picture of a turd, and I sent him a picture of my horse, and he sent me a picture of glue, and I sent him a picture of a toilet.

551
00:44:21,435 --> 00:44:23,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Here, take that foul thing back.

552
00:44:23,177 --> 00:44:24,138
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm supposed to be doing my homework.

553
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:30,865
[SPEAKER_24]: I was going to say, I found a way to distract DarkSakura from her homework.

554
00:44:31,205 --> 00:44:32,106
[SPEAKER_24]: Show her Pictochat.

555
00:44:32,346 --> 00:44:38,511
[SPEAKER_24]: And now Loki is drawing, he's repeatedly sending me pictures of him holding a gun, shooting RVGL children.

556
00:44:38,651 --> 00:44:39,612
[SPEAKER_24]: That's like the third one he sent.

557
00:44:39,652 --> 00:44:41,593
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright, I'm turning this off.

558
00:44:42,074 --> 00:44:42,854
[SPEAKER_24]: We got a show to do.

559
00:44:44,115 --> 00:44:47,118
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm just, I'm really scared about the next, like, anime con.

560
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:51,564
[SPEAKER_24]: or better yet DDR Tournament with all these DS's.

561
00:44:51,604 --> 00:44:57,270
[SPEAKER_24]: There's gonna be like every kid on the block's gonna have their DS there and drawing naughty pictures back and forth.

562
00:44:58,672 --> 00:45:02,136
[SPEAKER_24]: Did you like how there's a big old warning in the DS manual about parents?

563
00:45:03,097 --> 00:45:07,442
[SPEAKER_24]: You should advise your children if they're under 15 about the warnings of chatting with strangers.

564
00:45:08,996 --> 00:45:16,662
[SPEAKER_25]: When picking a name, make sure it's gender neutral.

565
00:45:17,142 --> 00:45:18,603
[SPEAKER_24]: I didn't understand the reasoning behind that.

566
00:45:18,704 --> 00:45:21,185
[SPEAKER_24]: So dirty old men can't pick up on you?

567
00:45:21,666 --> 00:45:22,466
[SPEAKER_24]: With a DS.

568
00:45:22,827 --> 00:45:26,470
[SPEAKER_24]: Seriously, if you're a dirty old man hitting on girls on a DS, you're sad.

569
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:28,531
[SPEAKER_07]: Desperation.

570
00:45:30,252 --> 00:45:30,833
[SPEAKER_24]: Let's see, here it is.

571
00:45:31,297 --> 00:45:33,399
[SPEAKER_24]: This is on page 10 of the manual.

572
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,982
[SPEAKER_24]: Important privacy information.

573
00:45:36,362 --> 00:45:40,447
[SPEAKER_24]: Nintendo DS wireless communication, including PictoChat, is not monitored.

574
00:45:40,607 --> 00:45:42,589
[SPEAKER_24]: In other words, they're saying this is not Xbox.

575
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:46,293
[SPEAKER_24]: This means PictoChat does not block messages from strangers.

576
00:45:46,733 --> 00:45:52,800
[SPEAKER_24]: Similar to unmonitored internet chat rooms, children should be warned about receiving messages from or communicating with strangers.

577
00:45:53,829 --> 00:46:01,095
[SPEAKER_24]: Up to 15 other DS users within range of your Nintendo DS may be able to view your nickname and messages within a selected chatroom at any one time.

578
00:46:01,135 --> 00:46:05,638
[SPEAKER_25]: I hope to God, because we live in an apartment complex with four buildings around here.

579
00:46:06,419 --> 00:46:08,881
[SPEAKER_25]: There's kids over there and they got video games.

580
00:46:09,501 --> 00:46:12,544
[SPEAKER_16]: Mommy, Mommy, give me PiktoChat, give me DS!

581
00:46:13,644 --> 00:46:14,485
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, I can't wait.

582
00:46:14,785 --> 00:46:16,507
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, hey, who's this chatting on here?

583
00:46:17,447 --> 00:46:18,028
[SPEAKER_25]: Penis.

584
00:46:22,765 --> 00:46:30,871
[SPEAKER_24]: and it goes on to say, an adult should assist children with a system setup and instruct them not to use personal information and not meet strangers.

585
00:46:31,412 --> 00:46:34,094
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, that's the part I don't get because how far does the DS work?

586
00:46:34,154 --> 00:46:35,375
[SPEAKER_24]: Like, it's only like 30 feet.

587
00:46:35,815 --> 00:46:37,777
[SPEAKER_24]: So chances are you're already by the stranger.

588
00:46:37,817 --> 00:46:39,458
[SPEAKER_25]: But, but, not necessarily because...

589
00:46:40,118 --> 00:46:43,300
[SPEAKER_25]: 30 feet, and I think that you can ping off of each other.

590
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:44,641
[SPEAKER_25]: I think.

591
00:46:44,661 --> 00:46:45,722
[SPEAKER_24]: That would be something else.

592
00:46:48,904 --> 00:46:52,346
[SPEAKER_24]: Or give personal information to anyone because it could be read by a stranger.

593
00:46:52,406 --> 00:46:55,888
[SPEAKER_24]: So don't put your credit card number on PictoChat, okay?

594
00:46:56,148 --> 00:47:00,470
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, 15-year-olds, don't put your credit card number or your social security on PictoChat.

595
00:47:00,851 --> 00:47:01,751
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, wait, wait, wait.

596
00:47:01,931 --> 00:47:02,792
[SPEAKER_25]: What?

597
00:47:03,712 --> 00:47:06,254
[SPEAKER_25]: Let me be the first one to say this right now, okay?

598
00:47:06,274 --> 00:47:06,354
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

599
00:47:07,742 --> 00:47:12,223
[SPEAKER_25]: You're going to see an article within, I'm going to give it like three months.

600
00:47:13,324 --> 00:47:16,545
[SPEAKER_25]: Kids caught in school using the DSs to cheat on tests.

601
00:47:16,585 --> 00:47:17,045
[SPEAKER_24]: Seriously.

602
00:47:17,585 --> 00:47:19,885
[SPEAKER_24]: You know what, they could already do it though, with cell phone text messaging.

603
00:47:20,106 --> 00:47:20,926
[SPEAKER_24]: I've already heard of that one.

604
00:47:21,506 --> 00:47:28,528
[SPEAKER_24]: In fact, even, because it's not a huge secret, I'm a teacher in my day job, except I teach adults, and adults are just as bad as children.

605
00:47:29,868 --> 00:47:31,389
[SPEAKER_24]: But they use email.

606
00:47:31,809 --> 00:47:34,029
[SPEAKER_24]: They'll use their email system to email each other during tests.

607
00:47:34,069 --> 00:47:34,650
[SPEAKER_24]: I have to watch them.

608
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:35,790
[SPEAKER_24]: It's sad.

609
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:38,499
[SPEAKER_24]: Not everybody.

610
00:47:38,779 --> 00:47:41,700
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm talking about one or two bad apples spoiling the bunch, obviously.

611
00:47:43,561 --> 00:47:47,702
[SPEAKER_24]: Whatever date you choose to enter as your month or day of birth, year is not asked for.

612
00:47:48,743 --> 00:47:52,504
[SPEAKER_24]: An it's your birthday message will be communicated in the chat room on that date.

613
00:47:53,964 --> 00:47:58,486
[SPEAKER_24]: For more information, visit Nintendo.com slash consumer slash DS privacy.

614
00:47:59,606 --> 00:48:02,207
[SPEAKER_24]: That's some good reading, if you're ever really poor.

615
00:48:02,327 --> 00:48:04,768
[SPEAKER_25]: I love how the little warning comes up every time you turn that on.

616
00:48:05,548 --> 00:48:07,389
[SPEAKER_25]: Be sure to look into the health risks

617
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:08,910
[SPEAKER_25]: We're playing the DS.

618
00:48:10,771 --> 00:48:11,891
[SPEAKER_24]: DS causes cancer.

619
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:16,312
[SPEAKER_24]: Anyway, back to the big Bomani news from this week.

620
00:48:16,532 --> 00:48:20,193
[SPEAKER_24]: Ultramix 2, DDR Ultramix 2 hitting the Xbox.

621
00:48:20,853 --> 00:48:28,534
[SPEAKER_24]: I know a lot of us have gotten a chance to play it on yesterday, 20 November, during the special, and some of us have been playing it throughout the weekend.

622
00:48:28,895 --> 00:48:31,435
[SPEAKER_24]: Loki, what did you think of Ultramix 2 overall?

623
00:48:32,035 --> 00:48:32,395
[SPEAKER_25]: It was good.

624
00:48:32,675 --> 00:48:35,736
[SPEAKER_25]: It was definitely a good mix of

625
00:48:37,202 --> 00:48:39,663
[SPEAKER_25]: Basically, it's almost all new stuff anyways.

626
00:48:40,624 --> 00:48:41,784
[SPEAKER_25]: And they did a really good job on it.

627
00:48:41,904 --> 00:48:43,185
[SPEAKER_25]: Really good job putting it together.

628
00:48:45,466 --> 00:48:49,387
[SPEAKER_25]: I was under the impression that there'd be more actual videos for these songs.

629
00:48:49,487 --> 00:48:54,709
[SPEAKER_25]: Like, you know, not this random shit, but eh, it's okay.

630
00:48:55,870 --> 00:48:57,170
[SPEAKER_25]: But the steps seem pretty good.

631
00:48:59,571 --> 00:49:03,973
[SPEAKER_25]: Really, I didn't have too many complaints about it.

632
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:07,362
[SPEAKER_25]: Except maybe, like, you know, bomb mode was kind of stupid.

633
00:49:09,503 --> 00:49:14,627
[SPEAKER_25]: Some of, like, the, you know, extra party stuff's kind of, eh, but whatever.

634
00:49:14,887 --> 00:49:17,249
[SPEAKER_25]: It's, I mean, it's different.

635
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:22,012
[SPEAKER_25]: That's pretty much all it is, yeah.

636
00:49:22,412 --> 00:49:23,393
[SPEAKER_25]: I like it so far, though.

637
00:49:23,413 --> 00:49:24,934
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, what about Songless?

638
00:49:25,566 --> 00:49:26,748
[SPEAKER_25]: Songlist was very good.

639
00:49:27,229 --> 00:49:34,043
[SPEAKER_25]: I like all this stuff that you haven't heard before, like the new remixes and this stuff from a different drum.

640
00:49:34,203 --> 00:49:35,466
[SPEAKER_25]: Very good decision there.

641
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:40,242
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, whoever decided to hook up with a different drum for the songs, bless you.

642
00:49:40,482 --> 00:49:42,143
[SPEAKER_24]: Bless your little heart a million times over.

643
00:49:42,323 --> 00:49:44,123
[SPEAKER_24]: That was the most genius idea for DDR.

644
00:49:44,444 --> 00:49:44,804
[SPEAKER_24]: Seriously.

645
00:49:45,144 --> 00:49:50,666
[SPEAKER_24]: That was as good as the original idea to hook up with Toshiba EMI in Japan for Dance Mania.

646
00:49:51,006 --> 00:49:57,689
[SPEAKER_24]: And I know I've said it on this show before, that all DDR needed was to hook up with another record label, just like Toshiba EMI in Japan.

647
00:49:57,749 --> 00:49:59,550
[SPEAKER_24]: Hook up with a record label here and get some good songs.

648
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:01,871
[SPEAKER_24]: And thank God, somebody finally listened.

649
00:50:01,911 --> 00:50:05,372
[SPEAKER_24]: Of course, I know they probably weren't really listening to me, but somebody else thought of the idea.

650
00:50:05,912 --> 00:50:08,734
[SPEAKER_24]: and hooray, it had great effects on DDR.

651
00:50:08,814 --> 00:50:11,316
[SPEAKER_24]: I think the different drum stuff is the best music in the game.

652
00:50:13,298 --> 00:50:21,123
[SPEAKER_24]: Anyway, Arcadian, what are your thoughts on Ultramix 2 being a DDR mostly import fanatic, but how do you like this domestic release?

653
00:50:21,183 --> 00:50:21,864
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was pretty good.

654
00:50:22,404 --> 00:50:27,688
[SPEAKER_06]: I would definitely say it was probably the best US mix that I've seen.

655
00:50:27,888 --> 00:50:29,430
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it probably is the best US mix.

656
00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:31,331
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, a lot of cool new stuff and

657
00:50:32,531 --> 00:50:36,055
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw on some of the videos for the new stuff, they have the website of the people.

658
00:50:37,097 --> 00:50:39,680
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of this stuff is pretty good.

659
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:41,823
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd want to actually check out the bands that did them.

660
00:50:43,092 --> 00:50:46,294
[SPEAKER_24]: Which I'm sure if any bands ever heard that, they'd be very happy to hear that.

661
00:50:46,374 --> 00:50:48,875
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, having their songs in DDR gets them the extra exposure.

662
00:50:49,235 --> 00:50:52,117
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, honestly, never heard of Echo Image.

663
00:50:52,537 --> 00:50:54,478
[SPEAKER_24]: Never heard of them before they were in Ultramix 2.

664
00:50:54,798 --> 00:50:56,619
[SPEAKER_24]: And now, I am a huge fan of them.

665
00:50:56,699 --> 00:50:58,360
[SPEAKER_24]: I know most of the people that do this show.

666
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,981
[SPEAKER_24]: I know we've gotten tons of listeners in on that band.

667
00:51:01,061 --> 00:51:02,422
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, it's great.

668
00:51:02,682 --> 00:51:05,803
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, it's been great promotion for not just them, but other bands too.

669
00:51:06,364 --> 00:51:08,485
[SPEAKER_24]: I know there's a lot of Day Behavior fans and stuff too, so.

670
00:51:09,085 --> 00:51:10,286
[SPEAKER_24]: But, anyway.

671
00:51:12,327 --> 00:51:12,847
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, Jamie?

672
00:51:13,650 --> 00:51:15,591
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing, I just don't think the sentence makes sense.

673
00:51:16,712 --> 00:51:18,253
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, you want to read that sentence?

674
00:51:18,873 --> 00:51:23,815
[SPEAKER_07]: It was Mr. Sucker's contention that this violated the implied warranty of merchantability.

675
00:51:24,696 --> 00:51:26,057
[SPEAKER_07]: Does that sound correct?

676
00:51:26,257 --> 00:51:27,637
[SPEAKER_24]: It's big words, but it sounds fine to me.

677
00:51:27,898 --> 00:51:28,218
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

678
00:51:28,698 --> 00:51:30,679
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't mean to interrupt the Vimani discussion.

679
00:51:30,699 --> 00:51:32,860
[SPEAKER_07]: I just had an agonizing moment over my own grammar.

680
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:34,681
[SPEAKER_22]: Have you gotten a chance to play Ultramix 2 at all?

681
00:51:34,861 --> 00:51:34,981
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

682
00:51:35,262 --> 00:51:35,562
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

683
00:51:35,642 --> 00:51:37,803
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't had a chance to do anything.

684
00:51:38,863 --> 00:51:42,025
[SPEAKER_24]: You'll have a chance before next week's show, or two weeks' show, hopefully.

685
00:51:42,186 --> 00:51:44,687
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm hoping to get some time in.

686
00:51:45,327 --> 00:51:49,390
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, it's probably going to be after I get back from Alabama.

687
00:51:51,111 --> 00:51:51,471
[SPEAKER_24]: Gotcha.

688
00:51:51,852 --> 00:51:53,152
[SPEAKER_07]: But I've had other priorities.

689
00:51:53,673 --> 00:51:54,093
[SPEAKER_24]: Fair enough.

690
00:51:54,373 --> 00:51:55,594
[SPEAKER_24]: But money can't always come first.

691
00:51:56,594 --> 00:51:57,155
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it could.

692
00:51:57,355 --> 00:52:06,761
[SPEAKER_24]: I left work early on Friday and ran over to Game Crazy to try and find the game, and all they had were the bundles, so I went over to GameStop instead.

693
00:52:06,781 --> 00:52:06,981
[SPEAKER_07]: Good.

694
00:52:07,611 --> 00:52:08,692
[SPEAKER_07]: Go to GameStop first.

695
00:52:09,372 --> 00:52:10,113
[SPEAKER_07]: You make me cry.

696
00:52:10,133 --> 00:52:12,314
[SPEAKER_22]: It's just the GameStop people are always hounding me.

697
00:52:12,334 --> 00:52:14,836
[SPEAKER_07]: Then go to the one at VOG Network.

698
00:52:14,856 --> 00:52:16,357
[SPEAKER_22]: It's too far of a drive.

699
00:52:16,537 --> 00:52:18,118
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, then tell me and I'll go.

700
00:52:18,198 --> 00:52:19,499
[SPEAKER_24]: Fine.

701
00:52:19,519 --> 00:52:19,839
[SPEAKER_24]: Hey.

702
00:52:19,859 --> 00:52:20,340
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright.

703
00:52:22,941 --> 00:52:23,282
[SPEAKER_24]: Sorry.

704
00:52:23,462 --> 00:52:24,462
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm crying.

705
00:52:24,563 --> 00:52:25,203
[SPEAKER_24]: No, you're not.

706
00:52:25,283 --> 00:52:25,743
[SPEAKER_24]: No, you're not.

707
00:52:27,745 --> 00:52:29,486
[SPEAKER_24]: Anything else you want to say about Ultramix 2, Arcadian?

708
00:52:29,506 --> 00:52:31,187
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and the backgrounds are seizureific.

709
00:52:31,968 --> 00:52:36,851
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you play it for like over an hour or so, you'll start to get a headache if you have those on.

710
00:52:37,899 --> 00:52:39,079
[SPEAKER_06]: I disagree, actually.

711
00:52:39,099 --> 00:52:47,922
[SPEAKER_06]: I think in the past three days, I've played more DDR than I have since I, like, first got into the game, or, like, I would say after 4th Mix was new in arcades.

712
00:52:47,962 --> 00:52:48,042
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh?

713
00:52:48,082 --> 00:52:49,882
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no, I have that set.

714
00:53:09,114 --> 00:53:09,614
[SPEAKER_24]: Sorry about that.

715
00:53:09,734 --> 00:53:15,375
[SPEAKER_24]: I've played more DDR in the past three days than I have since I first probably played fourth or fifth mix, honestly.

716
00:53:16,335 --> 00:53:17,716
[SPEAKER_24]: That's how much I'm into this mix.

717
00:53:18,016 --> 00:53:23,437
[SPEAKER_24]: And I haven't had a seizure yet, but I agree that the backgrounds are really bright and it makes sudden mode very difficult.

718
00:53:23,577 --> 00:53:24,737
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a seizure yesterday.

719
00:53:25,337 --> 00:53:25,577
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

720
00:53:26,177 --> 00:53:26,537
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm kidding.

721
00:53:26,817 --> 00:53:33,078
[SPEAKER_06]: They just seem to try to throw as much shit on the screen as possible so you'll screw up and miss the arrows.

722
00:53:33,298 --> 00:53:36,919
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll lose an arrow in all the busyness of the screen.

723
00:53:37,389 --> 00:53:38,669
[SPEAKER_24]: and in challenge mode, that can be a bitch.

724
00:53:40,990 --> 00:53:42,731
[SPEAKER_24]: You can trim the videos off, people.

725
00:53:42,971 --> 00:53:45,272
[SPEAKER_24]: I know, but it's not, it's much fun that way.

726
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:47,433
[SPEAKER_25]: What was up with Rage?

727
00:53:47,873 --> 00:53:53,615
[SPEAKER_25]: First off, having ginormous hair and second, dancing like a fucking woman.

728
00:53:55,275 --> 00:53:56,596
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, he did in fourth mix.

729
00:53:57,576 --> 00:53:58,656
[SPEAKER_07]: He had Emmys dances.

730
00:53:58,696 --> 00:54:03,398
[SPEAKER_24]: I have a feeling they only have one template for all the dance moves, so they're gender neutral dance moves.

731
00:54:03,418 --> 00:54:05,879
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know, that was all right.

732
00:54:07,805 --> 00:54:10,167
[SPEAKER_24]: Explicit, anything you wanted to share on Ultramix 2?

733
00:54:11,388 --> 00:54:12,068
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, he hasn't played it yet.

734
00:54:12,649 --> 00:54:16,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I haven't really played it yet, but I'll probably most likely play it this week.

735
00:54:17,412 --> 00:54:19,673
[SPEAKER_03]: If I can find anyone who has Ultramix 2.

736
00:54:19,733 --> 00:54:20,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.

737
00:54:21,434 --> 00:54:22,775
[SPEAKER_24]: Anything else you wanted to say, Arcadian?

738
00:54:22,815 --> 00:54:24,917
[SPEAKER_24]: You look like you had another thought you wanted to finish or something.

739
00:54:26,141 --> 00:54:27,042
[SPEAKER_24]: What?

740
00:54:27,442 --> 00:54:27,902
[SPEAKER_24]: What, Loki?

741
00:54:27,982 --> 00:54:29,543
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, the tournament we did on 20 November?

742
00:54:30,084 --> 00:54:34,347
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, unfortunately not a whole lot of people on Xbox Live just yet.

743
00:54:34,967 --> 00:54:42,392
[SPEAKER_24]: We tried doing a big tournament on Xbox Live yesterday, and we managed to finally get four people, a four-person tournament.

744
00:54:42,852 --> 00:54:43,373
[SPEAKER_24]: It was awesome.

745
00:54:43,753 --> 00:54:49,857
[SPEAKER_24]: But here's my advice to you guys that play the tournaments on Xbox Live, change the song, or else you'll play the whole song the whole tournament.

746
00:54:51,085 --> 00:54:51,666
[SPEAKER_24]: Get It All

747
00:55:20,908 --> 00:55:26,292
[SPEAKER_24]: And speaking of songpacks, songpack 7 is on the way out.

748
00:55:26,813 --> 00:55:28,294
[SPEAKER_24]: And we know some of the songs are going to be in that.

749
00:55:28,314 --> 00:55:31,116
[SPEAKER_24]: A lot of classic DDR songs, everything from end of the century to era.

750
00:55:31,156 --> 00:55:34,759
[SPEAKER_24]: And a brand new song, I feel, the Junk Circuit mix.

751
00:55:34,819 --> 00:55:35,500
[SPEAKER_24]: But unfortunately...

752
00:55:36,482 --> 00:55:46,347
[SPEAKER_24]: From what we understand, the song pack has been submitted, but it has not been added by Microsoft yet, which has been the case for a lot of previous song packs from DDR Ultramix.

753
00:55:46,367 --> 00:55:47,247
[SPEAKER_24]: So hopefully soon.

754
00:55:48,088 --> 00:55:51,670
[SPEAKER_24]: I would honestly check Monday, because I bet you Microsoft will add them on Monday.

755
00:55:51,710 --> 00:55:52,050
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll see.

756
00:55:52,810 --> 00:55:53,230
[SPEAKER_24]: We shall see.

757
00:55:56,115 --> 00:56:02,537
[SPEAKER_24]: As far as my personal thoughts on the mix, like I said, I've played this game more in the past three days than any DDR mix in a long, long time.

758
00:56:02,717 --> 00:56:03,598
[SPEAKER_24]: I really like it.

759
00:56:04,078 --> 00:56:12,240
[SPEAKER_24]: I love the fact that now it feels like DDR is not just being copies of Japanese mixes.

760
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:16,742
[SPEAKER_24]: And by that I mean, you know how when you run a copy on the copier and then you copy it again?

761
00:56:17,282 --> 00:56:17,983
[SPEAKER_24]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

762
00:56:37,498 --> 00:56:40,321
[SPEAKER_24]: But with Ultramix 2, I think a lot of people really didn't know what to expect.

763
00:56:40,901 --> 00:56:50,691
[SPEAKER_24]: It got slammed a lot after E3 because the interface was kind of weird and, you know, the song list was not all that hot at the time because they were keeping all the good stuff under wraps, but boy.

764
00:56:51,828 --> 00:56:56,031
[SPEAKER_24]: When they hooked up with a different drum and got all the new songs, it's just absolutely amazing.

765
00:56:56,051 --> 00:56:58,633
[SPEAKER_24]: And the Xbox Live stuff, phenomenal.

766
00:56:58,693 --> 00:57:01,755
[SPEAKER_24]: Having the edit steps online is great.

767
00:57:02,376 --> 00:57:12,483
[SPEAKER_24]: I would say the only downsides I've seen so far to the game is maybe I'm still noticing some frame rate issues in some songs.

768
00:57:12,883 --> 00:57:15,245
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not a huge deal.

769
00:57:15,445 --> 00:57:16,726
[SPEAKER_24]: No, it's a big deal.

770
00:57:17,306 --> 00:57:19,128
[SPEAKER_25]: With the videos running, it is big.

771
00:57:20,186 --> 00:57:24,451
[SPEAKER_25]: But, you know, if that really bothers you, turn off the videos, and I'm sure they'll fix it.

772
00:57:40,253 --> 00:57:41,154
[SPEAKER_24]: I had trouble with the controller, too.

773
00:57:41,174 --> 00:57:42,534
[SPEAKER_24]: I'd be hitting stuff, and it wouldn't register.

774
00:57:42,554 --> 00:57:43,075
[SPEAKER_24]: So, that was annoying.

775
00:58:04,636 --> 00:58:11,667
[SPEAKER_24]: I think a lot of people were saying that they were a little concerned about the steps when they first heard that new people are making the steps.

776
00:58:12,438 --> 00:58:15,581
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, longtime DDR fans, and oh, who knows what that could be.

777
00:58:15,661 --> 00:58:19,764
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think there were some people out there that were even dogging on it.

778
00:58:20,185 --> 00:58:23,908
[SPEAKER_24]: Makers of another game were dogging on the DDR Ultramix 2 stuff.

779
00:58:23,928 --> 00:58:26,590
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is really fucking unprofessional, excuse me.

780
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:28,692
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, yeah, we already discussed that on a previous episode.

781
00:58:28,712 --> 00:58:29,492
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm not going to go there again.

782
00:58:29,572 --> 00:58:36,718
[SPEAKER_24]: But I believe it was Cutris on DDR Freak said something about those folks are eating a nice slice of humble pie right now.

783
00:58:36,758 --> 00:58:38,380
[SPEAKER_24]: And I thought that was a very good way of putting it because...

784
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:40,681
[SPEAKER_24]: People are just loving the steps.

785
00:58:40,721 --> 00:58:44,884
[SPEAKER_24]: I honestly have not heard really bad things about the steps yet.

786
00:58:45,385 --> 00:58:48,527
[SPEAKER_24]: Which, in every DDR mix, what's the first thing that people knock?

787
00:58:48,887 --> 00:58:49,148
[SPEAKER_24]: Steps.

788
00:58:49,648 --> 00:58:50,348
[SPEAKER_24]: Every DDR mix.

789
00:58:50,809 --> 00:58:51,830
[SPEAKER_24]: But not this one so far.

790
00:58:52,330 --> 00:58:57,694
[SPEAKER_24]: Granted, there's been a couple people saying, oh, you know, some of the songs are AAA-able and the timing window is meh.

791
00:58:57,994 --> 00:59:00,356
[SPEAKER_24]: But that timing window and the steps aren't the same to me, you know.

792
00:59:00,856 --> 00:59:05,479
[SPEAKER_25]: Clearly, the person that was working on Sound Pack 6 was not working on this game.

793
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:06,240
Ha!

794
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:08,001
[SPEAKER_24]: and thank heavens for that.

795
00:59:08,721 --> 00:59:08,981
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

796
00:59:09,101 --> 00:59:16,024
[SPEAKER_24]: And it's been really neat to see the edit mode stuff online too because some folks over from the DDR Freak thread are already uploading all the Oni edits.

797
00:59:16,124 --> 00:59:17,065
[SPEAKER_24]: I saw some of those on there.

798
00:59:17,905 --> 00:59:18,846
[SPEAKER_24]: I downloaded a few of them.

799
00:59:18,866 --> 00:59:19,566
[SPEAKER_24]: It was pretty cool.

800
00:59:19,866 --> 00:59:23,668
[SPEAKER_25]: The only thing I had a problem with is they kind of tucked that away.

801
00:59:24,498 --> 00:59:46,130
[SPEAKER_24]: I agree it was not as easy to find as it should have been, but... And plus, I think it's kind of got a lousy setup, the way that you download the songs, because you have to have the person on your friends list, or they have to be in the top 100, which right now isn't a problem, but once you get more than 100 people on there with edits, it's going to be hard to find people with edits, so I...

802
00:59:46,969 --> 00:59:52,291
[SPEAKER_24]: I think that might be... It wasn't maybe the brightest way to do it, but maybe it was the only way they could.

803
00:59:52,431 --> 00:59:52,811
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know.

804
00:59:53,251 --> 00:59:54,091
[SPEAKER_24]: It's better than nothing.

805
00:59:54,131 --> 00:59:55,952
[SPEAKER_25]: It's better than nothing.

806
00:59:56,232 --> 00:59:57,732
[SPEAKER_25]: Or even later.

807
00:59:57,812 --> 01:00:03,394
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, who's to say you couldn't, you know... Because they have, you know, where you can update your software and stuff.

808
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:07,295
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know if I'd ever see that happening with Ultramix 2.

809
01:00:07,335 --> 01:00:09,496
[SPEAKER_24]: I think they'll just do an Ultramix 3 and fix all those things.

810
01:00:10,016 --> 01:00:10,456
[SPEAKER_24]: So we'll see.

811
01:00:12,616 --> 01:00:14,377
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, some of it's better than no it, so...

812
01:00:16,567 --> 01:00:16,747
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

813
01:00:17,227 --> 01:00:19,028
[SPEAKER_24]: All right.

814
01:00:20,069 --> 01:00:23,791
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, I'm going to go ahead and open up the Skype line if some folks want to comment on Ultramix 2.

815
01:00:23,971 --> 01:00:25,232
[SPEAKER_24]: You can go ahead and give us a call.

816
01:00:25,812 --> 01:00:34,516
[SPEAKER_24]: Just go over to www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on Interact With Us, and you can give our show a call and let us know your thoughts on Ultramix 2 if you picked it up.

817
01:00:35,297 --> 01:00:37,338
[SPEAKER_24]: Not the Japanese import games just yet.

818
01:00:37,378 --> 01:00:38,699
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll get to those in a little while.

819
01:00:38,759 --> 01:00:40,860
[SPEAKER_24]: I know some of you guys want to talk about Festival and the other stuff.

820
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:42,280
[SPEAKER_24]: We will get to those a little later.

821
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:44,081
[SPEAKER_24]: I just want to kind of talk about Ultramix 2 right now.

822
01:00:45,492 --> 01:00:47,554
[SPEAKER_24]: Favorite song so far in Ultramix 2.

823
01:00:47,634 --> 01:00:48,494
[SPEAKER_24]: What do you think, Loki?

824
01:00:49,255 --> 01:00:49,875
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, man.

825
01:00:55,419 --> 01:00:58,882
[SPEAKER_25]: I love the Midi Head remix of In My Eyes.

826
01:00:59,502 --> 01:01:00,143
[SPEAKER_25]: That's my favorite.

827
01:01:01,184 --> 01:01:03,105
[SPEAKER_25]: Second favorite, Monkey Punk.

828
01:01:04,146 --> 01:01:11,831
[SPEAKER_24]: Which is funny because I remember somebody saying that Monkey Punk, somebody who heard these songs before we did, saying that Monkey Punk was not that great of a song.

829
01:01:12,132 --> 01:01:13,092
[SPEAKER_24]: It's actually pretty funny.

830
01:01:13,533 --> 01:01:14,013
[SPEAKER_24]: I enjoyed it.

831
01:01:14,358 --> 01:01:16,360
[SPEAKER_25]: I like it because it just feels like guitar freaks.

832
01:01:19,062 --> 01:01:20,403
[SPEAKER_24]: Arcadian, favorite song in the mix so far?

833
01:01:21,745 --> 01:01:24,387
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't heard him enough to really give a favorite.

834
01:01:25,468 --> 01:01:31,293
[SPEAKER_06]: I like some of the new stuff, like the new sort of electronic type of stuff.

835
01:01:31,694 --> 01:01:33,155
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, a lot of the different drum stuff.

836
01:01:34,076 --> 01:01:36,138
[SPEAKER_24]: Anything that you've heard that you like so far?

837
01:01:36,638 --> 01:01:37,679
[SPEAKER_24]: Jamie, anything you've heard yet?

838
01:01:39,910 --> 01:01:42,771
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't been overly displeased except for the Tengoku.

839
01:01:43,832 --> 01:01:45,532
[SPEAKER_07]: That was just crappy.

840
01:01:48,254 --> 01:02:03,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Jonas, anything you... Well, I didn't really hear much of the songs, but some of the stuff I would consider my favorites so far until I actually play the game would be like Jam On It or... The booty ones.

841
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:04,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Or Burn For You.

842
01:02:05,181 --> 01:02:06,161
[SPEAKER_24]: Burn For You, yeah, that's a good one.

843
01:02:06,181 --> 01:02:08,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, those are my top two so far.

844
01:02:09,862 --> 01:02:19,130
[SPEAKER_24]: I would say my top three, Skulk, Love Skulk, Love Skulk, Wherever You Are by Lava, and Tough Enough by Vanilla Ninja.

845
01:02:20,411 --> 01:02:22,633
[SPEAKER_24]: Love that song, and the video is cheesy-rific.

846
01:02:22,873 --> 01:02:25,215
[SPEAKER_25]: Love Skulk, but hate the cut of Skulk.

847
01:02:26,255 --> 01:02:28,157
[SPEAKER_24]: You're kind of mad because they took out the vocals.

848
01:02:28,197 --> 01:02:32,240
[SPEAKER_25]: Horrible edit of Skulk, but other than that, it's alright.

849
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:34,242
[SPEAKER_25]: Once you hear the original, you're just like, ugh.

850
01:02:34,941 --> 01:02:35,301
[SPEAKER_24]: You know what?

851
01:02:35,461 --> 01:02:42,325
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know so much, because the part with the female vocals is my favorite part of the whole song, and that's in there, so I'm okay with the cut that they used.

852
01:02:42,705 --> 01:02:46,727
[SPEAKER_24]: I agree it's kind of sad that the male vocal couldn't be in there too, but I don't know how they could have cut it.

853
01:02:46,747 --> 01:02:52,810
[SPEAKER_25]: But they need to definitely make sure that this... Stick with a different drum for the next mix.

854
01:02:53,370 --> 01:02:54,090
[SPEAKER_25]: That's what I think.

855
01:02:54,310 --> 01:02:54,691
[SPEAKER_24]: Seriously.

856
01:02:55,011 --> 01:03:01,694
[SPEAKER_25]: Just establish yourselves with a different drum, because obviously it's bringing them a lot of, you know...

857
01:03:03,795 --> 01:03:13,654
[SPEAKER_25]: and it's just, you know, it's a very good deal, I think, because you're going to hear all these artists you've never heard before and you're going to kind of get these brand new artists coming out just because of this.

858
01:03:14,417 --> 01:03:15,498
[SPEAKER_24]: DarkTetsuya DarkTetsuya

859
01:03:38,055 --> 01:03:38,755
[SPEAKER_24]: Awesome video.

860
01:03:39,136 --> 01:03:44,418
[SPEAKER_24]: Love the gyrus full tilt video because it actually has screens from the old school gyrus and a lot of fun.

861
01:03:45,499 --> 01:03:45,819
[SPEAKER_24]: All right.

862
01:03:46,199 --> 01:03:50,742
[SPEAKER_24]: So anyway, I guess what we'll do is take a break.

863
01:03:50,762 --> 01:03:53,043
[SPEAKER_24]: Then we're going to come back and talk a little more about Ultramix 2.

864
01:03:54,423 --> 01:03:55,644
[SPEAKER_24]: Looks like folks are shy tonight.

865
01:03:55,684 --> 01:03:57,165
[SPEAKER_24]: Don't really want to talk to us on the Skype line.

866
01:03:57,185 --> 01:03:57,665
[SPEAKER_24]: That's fine.

867
01:03:57,725 --> 01:03:58,205
[SPEAKER_24]: See if we care.

868
01:03:59,806 --> 01:04:00,326
[SPEAKER_24]: That's just fine.

869
01:04:00,366 --> 01:04:01,327
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll sit here and talk for you.

870
01:04:02,205 --> 01:04:02,566
[SPEAKER_24]: Close Your Eyes

871
01:04:25,993 --> 01:04:30,440
[SPEAKER_16]: Close your eyes and let us fly, you and I

872
01:04:32,782 --> 01:04:58,080
[SPEAKER_16]: Together we can touch the sky I was walking down the street You came like the summer breeze Sweeping my breath away It doesn't happen every day You and I together in the sky Forever young, we can have a time of our lives

873
01:05:03,486 --> 01:05:04,927
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks for watching!

874
01:05:28,652 --> 01:05:45,201
[SPEAKER_16]: Close your eyes and let us fly You and I, together we can touch the sky Close your eyes, close your eyes and let us fly You and I, together we can touch the sky

875
01:06:01,697 --> 01:06:03,461
Thank you for watching!

876
01:06:34,742 --> 01:06:38,263
Yes, Marty Gantz, go ahead, play me something new right now.

877
01:06:38,283 --> 01:06:38,943
You're so smart.

878
01:06:38,963 --> 01:06:41,884
Go ahead, play me something I haven't heard before.

879
01:08:44,043 --> 01:08:45,725
Thank you for watching!

880
01:09:49,540 --> 01:09:55,105
[SPEAKER_21]: Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song, Orange Lounge Radio.

881
01:09:56,687 --> 01:10:04,033
[SPEAKER_24]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 119 in progress.

882
01:10:04,654 --> 01:10:10,099
[SPEAKER_24]: And somebody in chat said that they wanted to call on the Skype line, so I'm going to go ahead and open up the Skype line back one more time, see if we get a call.

883
01:10:11,027 --> 01:10:17,148
[SPEAKER_24]: So you can go ahead and call in our skyline right now if you want, www.orangeauntradio.com and click on Interact With Us.

884
01:10:18,809 --> 01:10:23,410
[SPEAKER_24]: While we're waiting for that call, Loki has some exciting news he wants to share with you guys about something we've got set up for next week.

885
01:10:23,470 --> 01:10:24,530
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh wait, never mind, we're getting that call.

886
01:10:24,630 --> 01:10:25,530
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll get back to that in a little bit.

887
01:10:26,450 --> 01:10:27,471
[SPEAKER_24]: Hi, you're on Orange Haunt Radio.

888
01:10:28,511 --> 01:10:29,031
[SPEAKER_26]: Hey Rob.

889
01:10:29,331 --> 01:10:30,131
[SPEAKER_24]: Hey, who's this?

890
01:10:30,671 --> 01:10:31,031
[SPEAKER_26]: Jazz.

891
01:10:31,231 --> 01:10:32,512
[SPEAKER_24]: Hi Jazz, how are you?

892
01:10:33,192 --> 01:10:34,032
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm good, how are you?

893
01:10:34,252 --> 01:10:34,732
[SPEAKER_24]: Good!

894
01:10:34,812 --> 01:10:36,172
[SPEAKER_24]: So you've been playing a lot of Ultramix too?

895
01:10:36,933 --> 01:10:37,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.

896
01:10:37,633 --> 01:10:38,713
[SPEAKER_24]: And what do you think so far?

897
01:10:39,730 --> 01:10:40,590
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's awesome.

898
01:10:40,770 --> 01:10:41,371
[SPEAKER_24]: You think it's awesome?

899
01:10:41,411 --> 01:10:43,331
[SPEAKER_24]: Now, you're somebody... How long have you been playing DDR?

900
01:10:44,732 --> 01:10:43,331
1999.

901
01:10:45,012 --> 01:10:48,573
[SPEAKER_24]: 1999.

902
01:10:45,312 --> 01:10:48,573
[SPEAKER_24]: And would you... You're old school like us.

903
01:10:48,773 --> 01:10:55,455
[SPEAKER_24]: Would you like me... Now, you don't have to agree with me, but would you say, along with me, that this is the best home mix they've ever released?

904
01:10:56,236 --> 01:10:57,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, yes.

905
01:10:57,096 --> 01:10:57,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.

906
01:10:58,656 --> 01:11:00,537
[SPEAKER_24]: What is it that makes this mix so damn beautiful?

907
01:11:01,929 --> 01:11:09,291
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because they took it in a whole new different direction and gave us Americans something that hasn't been rehashed from Japan a million times over.

908
01:11:10,111 --> 01:11:11,352
[SPEAKER_24]: It's the copy of a copy thing.

909
01:11:12,012 --> 01:11:12,432
[SPEAKER_24]: Exactly.

910
01:11:12,572 --> 01:11:13,012
[SPEAKER_24]: Exactly.

911
01:11:13,493 --> 01:11:17,814
[SPEAKER_24]: I'd say a different drum is the best thing that happened to Ultimix 2, honestly, my opinion.

912
01:11:18,174 --> 01:11:21,315
[SPEAKER_24]: And Xbox Live, because I love Xbox Live.

913
01:11:21,655 --> 01:11:25,236
[SPEAKER_24]: I never thought two, three years ago... How long ago did Xbox first come out?

914
01:11:25,276 --> 01:11:25,976
[SPEAKER_24]: Three years ago or so?

915
01:11:26,056 --> 01:11:29,557
[SPEAKER_24]: I never thought I would be sitting here saying I actually love an Xbox game, but it's true.

916
01:11:29,777 --> 01:11:30,638
[SPEAKER_24]: I have to eat my words.

917
01:11:31,338 --> 01:11:31,498
[SPEAKER_24]: Yep.

918
01:11:32,232 --> 01:11:33,333
[SPEAKER_24]: A lot of people are doing that.

919
01:11:33,594 --> 01:11:33,854
[SPEAKER_24]: I know.

920
01:11:33,894 --> 01:11:36,016
[SPEAKER_24]: So how's the competition going on Xbox Live?

921
01:11:36,056 --> 01:11:38,278
[SPEAKER_24]: Aren't you ranked like number three or four right now on there?

922
01:11:39,139 --> 01:11:40,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Something like that last time I checked.

923
01:11:41,175 --> 01:11:42,416
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty easy.

924
01:11:42,896 --> 01:11:43,656
[SPEAKER_02]: It's easy?

925
01:11:45,037 --> 01:11:48,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, the timing is really pathetic, actually.

926
01:11:48,258 --> 01:11:48,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah?

927
01:11:49,338 --> 01:11:52,219
[SPEAKER_02]: I like triple A'd at least ten songs last night.

928
01:11:52,739 --> 01:11:53,480
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm so surprised.

929
01:11:53,580 --> 01:11:55,741
[SPEAKER_24]: I triple A'd ten songs.

930
01:11:56,781 --> 01:12:00,122
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, on the 20 November special yesterday, I was playing on light mode.

931
01:12:00,342 --> 01:12:02,823
[SPEAKER_24]: Now shut up, because I was actually on dance pad.

932
01:12:03,243 --> 01:12:06,145
[SPEAKER_24]: I got one great on four songs in a row.

933
01:12:06,945 --> 01:12:07,165
[SPEAKER_24]: Nice.

934
01:12:07,185 --> 01:12:08,385
[SPEAKER_24]: I was so pissed off.

935
01:12:10,663 --> 01:12:13,704
[SPEAKER_02]: That happened to me a lot on Heavy, and I was really mad at that for a while.

936
01:12:15,945 --> 01:12:17,926
[SPEAKER_24]: Listen, you and your DDR skills.

937
01:12:19,427 --> 01:12:25,110
[SPEAKER_24]: Now, I don't know, any suggestions you would take to the Konami team for Ultramix 3 ideas?

938
01:12:27,931 --> 01:12:30,912
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot more 2DX crossovers, a lot more B-Mani crossovers.

939
01:12:30,972 --> 01:12:35,574
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even know that something like Midnight Special was so awesome until I actually got to play it.

940
01:12:37,015 --> 01:12:38,736
[SPEAKER_24]: Exactly, because that song was always in Guitar Freaks.

941
01:12:39,982 --> 01:12:43,845
[SPEAKER_24]: Is it just me, or does Sleepwalker sound like a total... Is that the name that's on Sleepwalker?

942
01:12:43,865 --> 01:12:45,526
[SPEAKER_24]: Does that sound like a total Guitar Freak song?

943
01:12:46,086 --> 01:12:46,347
[SPEAKER_24]: It does.

944
01:12:46,807 --> 01:12:49,289
[SPEAKER_24]: The Boy Zone, or whatever that other song was.

945
01:12:49,329 --> 01:12:50,129
[SPEAKER_24]: What was that other one?

946
01:12:50,649 --> 01:12:51,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Boy Jazz?

947
01:12:51,370 --> 01:12:52,050
[SPEAKER_24]: Boy Jazz.

948
01:12:52,431 --> 01:12:54,312
[SPEAKER_24]: No, Boy Zone is that Europe band, huh?

949
01:12:55,373 --> 01:12:56,353
[SPEAKER_24]: I think it's something else.

950
01:12:56,533 --> 01:12:57,054
[SPEAKER_24]: Euromix.

951
01:12:57,254 --> 01:12:57,914
[SPEAKER_24]: That's Euromix.

952
01:12:58,435 --> 01:12:58,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

953
01:12:59,435 --> 01:12:59,756
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright.

954
01:13:00,976 --> 01:13:01,797
[SPEAKER_24]: Anything else you wanted to say?

955
01:13:03,223 --> 01:13:06,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really, except, come on people, practice, give me a challenge.

956
01:13:07,386 --> 01:13:11,469
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, a call, a call to those on Xbox Live, challenge.

957
01:13:11,789 --> 01:13:13,551
[SPEAKER_24]: What's your gamer tag, so folks can find you?

958
01:13:14,251 --> 01:13:15,372
[SPEAKER_02]: KamikazeCat.

959
01:13:15,492 --> 01:13:17,093
[SPEAKER_24]: KamikazeCat, alright.

960
01:13:17,594 --> 01:13:18,214
[SPEAKER_24]: Whoop some ass.

961
01:13:18,515 --> 01:13:18,835
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright.

962
01:13:19,115 --> 01:13:19,355
Alright.

963
01:13:19,515 --> 01:13:19,976
[SPEAKER_24]: Good luck to you.

964
01:13:20,616 --> 01:13:21,317
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, you too.

965
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:22,057
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright, later, bye.

966
01:13:23,538 --> 01:13:26,841
[SPEAKER_24]: Now what he doesn't know is, I plan to take him over in the rankings very soon.

967
01:13:26,861 --> 01:13:28,282
[SPEAKER_16]: Sigh.

968
01:13:29,221 --> 01:13:46,266
[SPEAKER_24]: Now, maybe it's just me, but I honestly think that this DDR mix is so good that we seriously need to start hounding, and I don't mean like just writing letters and, you know, saying pretty please.

969
01:13:46,306 --> 01:13:55,429
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean hounding Konami, everybody, from every angle, to let Konami of Hawaii do a new arcade mix and put a new arcade mix out there in America.

970
01:13:57,099 --> 01:13:58,479
[SPEAKER_24]: Anybody else feel similarly at all?

971
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:01,200
[SPEAKER_24]: Or have you guys given up on DDR in the arcade?

972
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:01,661
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know.

973
01:14:02,261 --> 01:14:02,781
[SPEAKER_24]: Is it just me?

974
01:14:03,861 --> 01:14:06,962
[SPEAKER_07]: Not necessarily a having given up, just no expectation really.

975
01:14:08,563 --> 01:14:13,524
[SPEAKER_24]: That's kind of where I'm at right now, which is why it would be such a pleasant surprise to see a new arcade mix.

976
01:14:14,145 --> 01:14:21,027
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think that with all this great music they're getting in DDR now, and just the way it's been presented, and the way the steps were done and everything, I think...

977
01:14:22,017 --> 01:14:22,477
[SPEAKER_24]: Hostile Takeover!

978
01:14:22,497 --> 01:14:23,618
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll buy 51 shares of their stock!

979
01:14:49,414 --> 01:14:50,314
[SPEAKER_24]: That's a really good idea.

980
01:14:50,614 --> 01:14:51,455
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we could do that.

981
01:14:51,495 --> 01:14:52,295
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, my God.

982
01:14:53,155 --> 01:14:57,076
[SPEAKER_07]: And honestly, as shareholders, we would have interest in the company's activity.

983
01:14:57,176 --> 01:14:58,196
[SPEAKER_17]: That is a brilliant idea.

984
01:14:59,657 --> 01:15:02,437
[SPEAKER_07]: Is Konami a publicly traded company, though, because it's Japanese?

985
01:15:02,637 --> 01:15:03,738
[SPEAKER_07]: I do believe so, actually.

986
01:15:04,178 --> 01:15:05,398
[SPEAKER_07]: One second.

987
01:15:05,458 --> 01:15:07,438
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, she's looking it up in the business law book.

988
01:15:08,039 --> 01:15:09,099
[SPEAKER_24]: That's a really good idea.

989
01:15:11,099 --> 01:15:13,240
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, man, we should become Konami shareholders.

990
01:15:16,621 --> 01:15:17,821
[SPEAKER_24]: That's a great idea, Jamie.

991
01:15:19,099 --> 01:15:19,379
[SPEAKER_24]: All right.

992
01:15:20,580 --> 01:15:30,004
[SPEAKER_24]: All right, Jamie's going to look that up in the business law book over there on what's going on with the possibility of buying shares in Kami.

993
01:15:30,044 --> 01:15:30,684
[SPEAKER_24]: Any other methods?

994
01:15:30,704 --> 01:15:34,906
[SPEAKER_07]: Just check up, make sure, see what their corporate deal is.

995
01:15:35,106 --> 01:15:36,407
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

996
01:15:36,487 --> 01:15:38,868
[SPEAKER_24]: Any thoughts from you, Loki, about a new arcade mix?

997
01:15:39,148 --> 01:15:41,849
[SPEAKER_24]: Haven't you been saying for a long time they need to do a new arcade mix?

998
01:15:42,269 --> 01:15:43,350
[SPEAKER_24]: Now you're all of a sudden really quiet.

999
01:15:44,722 --> 01:15:45,102
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm Lovin' It!

1000
01:15:59,856 --> 01:16:07,422
[SPEAKER_07]: Businesses have relationships with all sorts of people, other than their stockholders, including employees, suppliers, customers, creditors, and the local community.

1001
01:16:08,222 --> 01:16:15,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Under the stakeholder interest theory of social responsibility, a corporation must consider the effects its actions will have on the other stakeholders.

1002
01:16:17,737 --> 01:16:27,921
[SPEAKER_07]: So there may actually be a legal requirement to satisfy those who have a stake in their activity.

1003
01:16:28,582 --> 01:16:31,223
[SPEAKER_07]: Not just their shareholders, but also their customers.

1004
01:16:33,564 --> 01:16:34,224
[SPEAKER_24]: This is a great idea.

1005
01:16:34,324 --> 01:16:36,205
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm seriously going to look into buying Konami stock.

1006
01:16:36,385 --> 01:16:39,226
[SPEAKER_24]: You could just buy like 5-10 shares of stock on E-Trade, right?

1007
01:16:40,233 --> 01:16:41,053
[SPEAKER_07]: There's also this one here.

1008
01:16:41,453 --> 01:16:47,815
[SPEAKER_07]: For example, a corporation would violate the stakeholder interest theory if it viewed employees solely as a means of maximizing stockholder wealth.

1009
01:16:48,576 --> 01:16:52,457
[SPEAKER_07]: So, basically, they have to treat their employees well, of course.

1010
01:16:53,157 --> 01:17:06,401
[SPEAKER_07]: But also, that's just saying that anyone who has an interest in the activity of the company, you know, if they're not meeting the majority interest, then they're actually violating that rule.

1011
01:17:06,843 --> 01:17:10,626
[SPEAKER_24]: So if you love Konami and you want to see them do right, put your money where your mouth is.

1012
01:17:10,646 --> 01:17:11,547
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I have that right.

1013
01:17:11,587 --> 01:17:12,347
[SPEAKER_24]: Buy a piece of them.

1014
01:17:13,168 --> 01:17:14,309
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's a brilliant idea.

1015
01:17:14,609 --> 01:17:15,950
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that we should buy Konami stock.

1016
01:17:16,531 --> 01:17:17,091
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm going to do it.

1017
01:17:17,311 --> 01:17:18,252
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm going to look into it.

1018
01:17:18,352 --> 01:17:18,812
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1019
01:17:18,852 --> 01:17:20,694
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a business major in the chat room.

1020
01:17:20,874 --> 01:17:21,695
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you answer this for me?

1021
01:17:23,656 --> 01:17:25,357
[SPEAKER_24]: I know, maybe we're just talking out our asses here.

1022
01:17:25,617 --> 01:17:27,218
[SPEAKER_24]: But in theory, it sounds like a good idea.

1023
01:17:27,258 --> 01:17:27,818
[SPEAKER_24]: It really does.

1024
01:17:27,878 --> 01:17:28,278
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know.

1025
01:17:28,919 --> 01:17:32,860
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean... Oh, Zaku found the financial info.

1026
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:33,661
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, beautiful.

1027
01:17:34,001 --> 01:17:34,701
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Zaku.

1028
01:17:35,101 --> 01:17:36,642
[SPEAKER_24]: He put a link in our chat room there over it.

1029
01:17:36,662 --> 01:17:40,024
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I might have misinterpreted some of this, but let me look at this.

1030
01:17:40,164 --> 01:17:45,926
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, okay, granted, one person couldn't just buy two shares and then expect to run the company.

1031
01:17:46,447 --> 01:17:46,707
[SPEAKER_24]: But if...

1032
01:17:47,387 --> 01:17:51,709
[SPEAKER_24]: Several people bought several shares that collectively had a say.

1033
01:17:52,409 --> 01:17:53,349
[SPEAKER_24]: They might listen to you.

1034
01:17:53,630 --> 01:17:55,030
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe we should incorporate ourselves.

1035
01:17:55,750 --> 01:17:56,291
[SPEAKER_24]: Seriously.

1036
01:17:57,791 --> 01:17:59,692
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, I think we need to do that anyway.

1037
01:18:00,952 --> 01:18:05,094
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, but Orange Lawn Trading will not be a publicly traded company because nobody's going to tell us what to do.

1038
01:18:05,474 --> 01:18:05,954
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

1039
01:18:06,775 --> 01:18:08,795
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be privately owned.

1040
01:18:09,336 --> 01:18:10,616
[SPEAKER_25]: What are our earnings for this year?

1041
01:18:12,137 --> 01:18:12,577
[SPEAKER_25]: One dollar.

1042
01:18:15,052 --> 01:18:24,377
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to thank my friend Julie who I'm on another form of chat that I'm not letting anybody know because I don't want them to send me messages all of a sudden.

1043
01:18:26,178 --> 01:18:34,923
[SPEAKER_07]: The site, if you're ready, is konami.com slash en slash ir slash um wait

1044
01:18:37,020 --> 01:18:38,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Another page popped up over it.

1045
01:18:38,141 --> 01:18:39,142
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me get the address again.

1046
01:18:39,802 --> 01:18:40,083
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

1047
01:18:40,923 --> 01:18:48,050
[SPEAKER_07]: It's konami.com slash en slash ir slash stockholder info, all one word, slash index.html.

1048
01:18:50,472 --> 01:18:52,694
[SPEAKER_07]: And it actually goes back to investor relations.

1049
01:18:53,975 --> 01:18:56,477
[SPEAKER_24]: I posted that in our chat room if folks are curious about that one.

1050
01:18:56,497 --> 01:18:57,017
[SPEAKER_07]: This is kind of cool.

1051
01:18:57,197 --> 01:18:58,258
[SPEAKER_24]: This is very interesting.

1052
01:18:58,278 --> 01:19:02,562
[SPEAKER_24]: This is a very interesting direction you've just kind of taken this program, Jamie.

1053
01:19:02,602 --> 01:19:03,243
[SPEAKER_24]: Very interesting.

1054
01:19:05,175 --> 01:19:09,477
[SPEAKER_24]: As of 19 November, KNM stock is $22.09 a share.

1055
01:19:09,917 --> 01:19:11,178
[SPEAKER_24]: Not too shabby.

1056
01:19:11,458 --> 01:19:12,538
[SPEAKER_24]: I could buy five shares of that.

1057
01:19:14,699 --> 01:19:20,922
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe we as, you know, find out how many shares are available.

1058
01:19:21,762 --> 01:19:22,062
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know.

1059
01:19:24,730 --> 01:19:28,772
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know the first thing about playing the stock market.

1060
01:19:28,852 --> 01:19:35,635
[SPEAKER_07]: But as shareholders, though, we would have a right in our voice and how the company is run.

1061
01:19:35,855 --> 01:19:36,876
[SPEAKER_24]: This is what it is for me.

1062
01:19:37,476 --> 01:19:38,477
[SPEAKER_24]: I love this game.

1063
01:19:39,077 --> 01:19:42,399
[SPEAKER_24]: My life has changed for the better in many ways because of this game.

1064
01:19:42,419 --> 01:19:45,300
[SPEAKER_24]: And I know that kind of sounds, you know, maybe sad to some people.

1065
01:19:45,340 --> 01:19:47,861
[SPEAKER_24]: But seriously, I've met a lot of great people because of this game.

1066
01:19:48,361 --> 01:19:49,042
[SPEAKER_24]: I've, you know...

1067
01:19:50,943 --> 01:19:56,989
[SPEAKER_24]: I've started, along with DarkSakura and Loki, a radio program which I love doing twice a week.

1068
01:19:57,529 --> 01:19:58,590
[SPEAKER_24]: This game has done so much.

1069
01:19:58,730 --> 01:19:59,591
[SPEAKER_24]: I believe in this game.

1070
01:19:59,731 --> 01:20:00,992
[SPEAKER_24]: I want to see this game have a future.

1071
01:20:01,052 --> 01:20:03,815
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm going to put my money where my mouth is and buy a piece of it.

1072
01:20:04,155 --> 01:20:08,259
[SPEAKER_07]: One thing that I need to point out, too, who is this Primo Maggot, I guess?

1073
01:20:08,519 --> 01:20:18,243
[SPEAKER_07]: You can only buy as many shares are available too for purchase because they are going to take certain interest to make sure that those takeover cases... One person doesn't do a hostile takeover.

1074
01:20:18,403 --> 01:20:19,464
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly, exactly.

1075
01:20:19,504 --> 01:20:28,808
[SPEAKER_07]: They have ways of making sure that you're not... But at any rate, even if you own one share, you have basically an interest in how the company operates.

1076
01:20:29,682 --> 01:20:33,028
[SPEAKER_07]: You have a right to say, I am not pleased with what you are doing.

1077
01:20:33,088 --> 01:20:34,230
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to listen to me.

1078
01:20:36,033 --> 01:20:40,040
[SPEAKER_24]: Not that I would say I'm not pleased with what they're doing, but I would say...

1079
01:20:40,543 --> 01:20:46,526
[SPEAKER_07]: But overall, I mean in general, you know, I'm disappointed in what you're doing.

1080
01:20:47,086 --> 01:21:00,954
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's just a matter of, you know, you now actually, as you have a full, you know, an interest in their activity, not just an interest as a consumer, but an interest as someone who is making money off of this company.

1081
01:21:01,034 --> 01:21:06,817
[SPEAKER_24]: I think you've got a great idea on your hands, Jamie, and it is worth the hundred bucks for five shares to find out, honestly.

1082
01:21:07,267 --> 01:21:26,476
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, if really, if you want to make your voice heard, you can write all the letters you want to until the cows come home, until they're run over by a Katamari, but if you actually go out, put the money down and say, I have interest in your company, this is what I would like to see, then this is a real definite way to make your voice heard.

1083
01:21:27,857 --> 01:21:28,297
[SPEAKER_24]: Interesting.

1084
01:21:28,417 --> 01:21:31,078
[SPEAKER_24]: This is going to be very interesting to see where this goes.

1085
01:21:31,298 --> 01:21:34,520
[SPEAKER_24]: If anything becomes of this idea, I'm very curious to see what happens.

1086
01:21:34,780 --> 01:21:35,120
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll see.

1087
01:21:35,881 --> 01:21:36,641
[SPEAKER_24]: Loki, you have a comment?

1088
01:21:37,986 --> 01:21:42,690
[SPEAKER_25]: Um... No, I was just thinking it'd be cool if they had DDR for the DS.

1089
01:21:43,810 --> 01:21:44,431
[SPEAKER_24]: Second work.

1090
01:21:47,153 --> 01:21:47,553
[SPEAKER_24]: Anyway.

1091
01:21:49,654 --> 01:21:50,015
[SPEAKER_24]: Wow.

1092
01:21:50,375 --> 01:21:50,435
[SPEAKER_24]: Or...

1093
01:21:52,985 --> 01:21:54,867
[SPEAKER_24]: Now the chat room is running away with this idea.

1094
01:21:54,927 --> 01:22:00,172
[SPEAKER_24]: Zaku says, I propose every DDR player in the country over the age of 18 buy at least one share of Konami stock.

1095
01:22:00,813 --> 01:22:04,656
[SPEAKER_24]: Maybe pulling legs there, but if you could get a large amount of them too, you could.

1096
01:22:06,018 --> 01:22:09,041
[SPEAKER_24]: And then Primo Maggot says, and then show up at Konami's shareholder meeting.

1097
01:22:09,810 --> 01:22:10,291
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

1098
01:22:11,612 --> 01:22:14,996
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm actually seriously considering doing it.

1099
01:22:15,076 --> 01:22:15,817
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at this, Jamie.

1100
01:22:16,157 --> 01:22:19,261
[SPEAKER_22]: Your school and now this are coming together.

1101
01:22:19,341 --> 01:22:21,103
[SPEAKER_22]: You can apply this business law knowledge.

1102
01:22:21,123 --> 01:22:21,944
[SPEAKER_22]: Your professor would be so proud.

1103
01:22:21,964 --> 01:22:24,527
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though I changed my major and the class is no longer required.

1104
01:22:25,188 --> 01:22:25,608
[SPEAKER_24]: That's alright.

1105
01:22:25,868 --> 01:22:27,390
[SPEAKER_24]: You would still make your professor proud.

1106
01:22:27,410 --> 01:22:29,192
[SPEAKER_24]: Do you want to send a copy of this program?

1107
01:22:29,533 --> 01:22:30,554
[SPEAKER_24]: Or do we say fuck too much?

1108
01:22:34,964 --> 01:22:36,945
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we say fuck a bit too much.

1109
01:22:36,965 --> 01:22:44,609
[SPEAKER_25]: Would they allow me to come in wearing an eyepatch and a pirate bandana during the shareholders meeting?

1110
01:22:45,029 --> 01:22:47,650
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm not going to do a hostile takeover.

1111
01:22:48,330 --> 01:22:56,254
[SPEAKER_24]: Honestly, if you want to be taken seriously, if you want this idea to be taken seriously, no, you can't come to the shareholders meeting dressed like a pirate.

1112
01:23:01,007 --> 01:23:03,129
[SPEAKER_24]: But I think Hell No, We Won't Go would be okay.

1113
01:23:03,769 --> 01:23:04,210
[SPEAKER_24]: No, I don't know.

1114
01:23:04,730 --> 01:23:05,110
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll see.

1115
01:23:07,292 --> 01:23:07,993
[SPEAKER_24]: Very interesting.

1116
01:23:08,253 --> 01:23:10,335
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright, well, to be continued.

1117
01:23:10,415 --> 01:23:11,015
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm going to do something.

1118
01:23:11,035 --> 01:23:11,916
[SPEAKER_25]: I play party games.

1119
01:23:11,976 --> 01:23:14,138
[SPEAKER_25]: Come on, what were you thinking?

1120
01:23:15,019 --> 01:23:18,101
[SPEAKER_24]: I've got a lot of time off work this week thanks to Thanksgiving.

1121
01:23:19,322 --> 01:23:23,125
[SPEAKER_25]: I have a lot of time off during work thanks to my work.

1122
01:23:23,866 --> 01:23:27,029
[SPEAKER_24]: So now it's on.

1123
01:23:27,309 --> 01:23:29,551
[SPEAKER_07]: Julie suggested we insert bleep for fuck.

1124
01:23:31,641 --> 01:23:33,483
[SPEAKER_24]: No way, I'm not going to bleeping censor myself.

1125
01:23:33,943 --> 01:23:34,243
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright.

1126
01:23:34,503 --> 01:23:35,424
[SPEAKER_07]: Bleep you, buddy.

1127
01:23:43,070 --> 01:23:45,452
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright, let's change topics completely.

1128
01:23:45,492 --> 01:23:47,253
[SPEAKER_24]: Something we haven't talked about a whole lot tonight.

1129
01:23:47,634 --> 01:23:48,294
[SPEAKER_24]: Damn, it's a big deal.

1130
01:23:48,674 --> 01:23:49,775
[SPEAKER_24]: Where are we going to be talking?

1131
01:23:49,795 --> 01:23:50,756
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh yeah, okay, sorry, Loki.

1132
01:23:51,917 --> 01:23:54,759
[SPEAKER_24]: We're going to do the Akira Yamaoka giveaway very soon.

1133
01:23:54,819 --> 01:23:56,881
[SPEAKER_24]: But Loki, you have an announcement you want to talk about.

1134
01:23:57,621 --> 01:24:00,764
[SPEAKER_25]: Anyways, as we were mentioning earlier about, you know...

1135
01:24:01,584 --> 01:24:06,826
[SPEAKER_25]: How we were going to have Conception on the show and Conceptions out there with Waldo.

1136
01:24:09,167 --> 01:24:14,248
[SPEAKER_25]: In the meantime, we were talking with another artist out there and I think we mentioned it on the other show.

1137
01:24:15,009 --> 01:24:25,372
[SPEAKER_25]: Next week, on Orange Suns Radio, coming to you live, the guy behind one of the best remixes, I think, in this new Ultramix 2.

1138
01:24:25,632 --> 01:24:26,793
[SPEAKER_24]: In any DDR, honestly.

1139
01:24:26,813 --> 01:24:29,714
[SPEAKER_25]: And in any DDR, MidiHead will be on the show.

1140
01:24:30,054 --> 01:24:30,374
[SPEAKER_11]: Woo!

1141
01:24:31,334 --> 01:24:32,955
[SPEAKER_24]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

1142
01:24:51,850 --> 01:24:57,714
[SPEAKER_25]: He did actually one of the trailers for the Matrix Reloaded, I should say.

1143
01:24:57,834 --> 01:25:00,295
[SPEAKER_25]: One of the songs that I entered in Cage Mansion.

1144
01:25:00,315 --> 01:25:01,075
[SPEAKER_25]: Didn't win, but that's okay.

1145
01:25:01,856 --> 01:25:04,157
[SPEAKER_25]: And just a bunch of other stuff.

1146
01:25:05,138 --> 01:25:07,819
[SPEAKER_25]: I think there's some other games also, but I don't remember offhand.

1147
01:25:08,380 --> 01:25:10,921
[SPEAKER_25]: But yeah, he will be on the show next week.

1148
01:25:11,354 --> 01:25:11,894
[SPEAKER_24]: And this one will air!

1149
01:25:32,488 --> 01:25:34,670
[SPEAKER_24]: For MidiHead, you can send them in.

1150
01:25:34,730 --> 01:25:39,432
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll create a thread on our forums, or you can ask questions live during next week's show.

1151
01:25:39,652 --> 01:25:42,914
[SPEAKER_24]: I can't eat this microphone, I found out.

1152
01:25:43,335 --> 01:25:45,656
[SPEAKER_24]: Anyway, let's get to the other order of business tonight.

1153
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:09,104
[SPEAKER_24]: That's right, it is time for the very first drawing in the Akira Yamoka signed CD giveaway.

1154
01:26:09,144 --> 01:26:12,966
[SPEAKER_24]: We've asked you questions Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday nights.

1155
01:26:13,366 --> 01:26:20,410
[SPEAKER_24]: You guys have entered, and we're going to pull a name out of the hat right now and find ourselves a winner right now, live on air.

1156
01:26:21,110 --> 01:26:24,992
[SPEAKER_24]: Don't worry guys, though, if you didn't win this week, you got a whole nother chance.

1157
01:26:25,012 --> 01:26:28,853
[SPEAKER_24]: We're doing the whole thing, we're just rewinding and repeating, next week.

1158
01:26:29,153 --> 01:26:33,235
[SPEAKER_24]: And you have a chance to win Monday night, Tuesday night, and Thursday night.

1159
01:26:33,295 --> 01:26:35,116
[SPEAKER_24]: Monday night, Diversion, the Bomani Remix show.

1160
01:26:35,136 --> 01:26:37,437
[SPEAKER_24]: Tuesday night, Pump Up the Volume, Randomness with DarkSakura.

1161
01:26:37,457 --> 01:26:39,858
[SPEAKER_24]: And Thursday night, Outside the Box, gaming with myself.

1162
01:26:40,498 --> 01:26:40,978
[SPEAKER_24]: And remember...

1163
01:26:43,004 --> 01:26:43,805
[SPEAKER_24]: Listen all three nights.

1164
01:26:44,246 --> 01:26:44,927
[SPEAKER_24]: You can enter three times.

1165
01:26:44,947 --> 01:26:46,509
[SPEAKER_24]: You can enter three times if you listen all three nights.

1166
01:26:46,529 --> 01:26:47,491
[SPEAKER_24]: You can enter chances.

1167
01:26:47,511 --> 01:26:50,295
[SPEAKER_24]: And I realize one of those nights is Thanksgiving, but you know what?

1168
01:26:50,335 --> 01:26:52,639
[SPEAKER_24]: If I'm going to be here and do a show, we're going to do a drawing, dammit.

1169
01:26:52,999 --> 01:26:53,300
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright.

1170
01:26:53,861 --> 01:26:55,142
[SPEAKER_24]: So, Jamie, you want to pick our winner?

1171
01:26:55,782 --> 01:26:57,243
[SPEAKER_07]: Do I want to?

1172
01:26:57,323 --> 01:26:57,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure!

1173
01:26:57,943 --> 01:26:58,843
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright, she's going to pick her winner.

1174
01:26:58,863 --> 01:27:02,204
[SPEAKER_24]: She's going to reach into the hat and pull out a... Ooh, it's the Dr. Dick hat.

1175
01:27:02,284 --> 01:27:02,965
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel dirty.

1176
01:27:03,065 --> 01:27:04,525
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, it's the Dr. Dick hat.

1177
01:27:05,225 --> 01:27:05,766
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright, hold on.

1178
01:27:05,786 --> 01:27:07,986
[SPEAKER_24]: We're going to... I'm going to mix it up.

1179
01:27:09,147 --> 01:27:10,367
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to caress the names.

1180
01:27:10,807 --> 01:27:14,329
[SPEAKER_24]: You can caress the lovely names and then pull one out of the hat and we're going to see who wins.

1181
01:27:15,529 --> 01:27:17,210
[SPEAKER_14]: Ooh.

1182
01:27:18,350 --> 01:27:21,231
[SPEAKER_14]: Ooh.

1183
01:27:21,591 --> 01:27:21,751
[SPEAKER_14]: Ah.

1184
01:27:22,372 --> 01:27:22,992
[SPEAKER_14]: Pick one.

1185
01:27:27,915 --> 01:27:28,296
[SPEAKER_10]: Jazz!

1186
01:27:29,298 --> 01:27:30,720
[SPEAKER_22]: Jazz is the winner!

1187
01:27:30,821 --> 01:27:34,127
[SPEAKER_24]: Congratulations!

1188
01:27:34,147 --> 01:27:35,910
[SPEAKER_24]: He was the one that just called, too!

1189
01:27:37,375 --> 01:27:37,795
[SPEAKER_24]: Yay!

1190
01:27:37,835 --> 01:27:38,356
[SPEAKER_24]: Yay!

1191
01:28:07,631 --> 01:28:07,951
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright.

1192
01:28:09,912 --> 01:28:10,972
[SPEAKER_24]: Is he even listening still?

1193
01:28:11,032 --> 01:28:11,372
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know.

1194
01:28:11,432 --> 01:28:14,093
[SPEAKER_24]: He probably went back to playing Ultramix 2, so he probably doesn't even know he won.

1195
01:28:15,533 --> 01:28:16,253
[SPEAKER_25]: He's all, huh?

1196
01:28:18,894 --> 01:28:19,614
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, he just went, huh?

1197
01:28:21,075 --> 01:28:22,435
[SPEAKER_24]: He doesn't even know why he won.

1198
01:28:23,495 --> 01:28:24,976
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright, well, he'll figure it out pretty soon.

1199
01:28:26,296 --> 01:28:26,916
[SPEAKER_25]: He figured it out.

1200
01:28:26,956 --> 01:28:28,457
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, I guess the buffer, yeah.

1201
01:28:32,958 --> 01:28:33,958
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, Jazz, you won.

1202
01:28:36,599 --> 01:28:36,939
[SPEAKER_25]: Anyways.

1203
01:28:37,316 --> 01:28:49,664
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright, so he's going to win that signed Akira Yamaoka, what is this here, a mini-disc from Silent Hill 4, The Room, it's a Japanese CD, here, we'll put this on cam too, and it's signed by Akira Yamaoka.

1204
01:28:49,964 --> 01:28:52,986
[SPEAKER_24]: Again, if you didn't win tonight, try again this week.

1205
01:28:53,006 --> 01:28:56,468
[SPEAKER_25]: And he gets the special copy that I scraped with iron wool.

1206
01:28:58,669 --> 01:29:00,510
[SPEAKER_24]: No, you did not, quit lying, quit lying.

1207
01:29:01,051 --> 01:29:03,332
[SPEAKER_24]: But maybe we'll send Jazz some other orange launch prizes as well.

1208
01:29:03,352 --> 01:29:04,573
[SPEAKER_25]: But those are speed grooves.

1209
01:29:07,335 --> 01:29:07,855
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, that'd be cool.

1210
01:29:08,575 --> 01:29:10,356
[SPEAKER_24]: Jamie's going to try and scan it so we can get a picture in.

1211
01:29:10,796 --> 01:29:12,897
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll do that with the other disc that we're going to give away this next week.

1212
01:29:13,357 --> 01:29:15,517
[SPEAKER_24]: I can try and put this on cam, but I don't think it's going to turn out very well.

1213
01:29:15,537 --> 01:29:15,737
[SPEAKER_24]: Let me try.

1214
01:29:15,757 --> 01:29:17,458
[SPEAKER_25]: There's speed to make it play faster.

1215
01:29:23,099 --> 01:29:25,100
[SPEAKER_25]: Jamie, you know what we've missed?

1216
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:26,100
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1217
01:29:27,601 --> 01:29:28,061
[SPEAKER_25]: The ferrets.

1218
01:29:29,441 --> 01:29:30,241
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, listeners.

1219
01:29:31,142 --> 01:29:31,822
[SPEAKER_07]: Give me the babies!

1220
01:29:34,812 --> 01:29:35,733
[SPEAKER_07]: My parrots.

1221
01:29:35,773 --> 01:29:36,274
[SPEAKER_17]: My parrots.

1222
01:29:38,055 --> 01:29:39,316
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, don't throw that at my paper.

1223
01:29:41,558 --> 01:29:41,938
[SPEAKER_07]: Babies.

1224
01:29:44,300 --> 01:29:45,181
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this the retard baby?

1225
01:29:46,642 --> 01:29:47,943
[SPEAKER_25]: I think the retard baby is in the closet.

1226
01:29:47,963 --> 01:29:48,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, this is my laptop, okay?

1227
01:29:49,184 --> 01:29:49,484
[SPEAKER_25]: Sorry.

1228
01:29:49,804 --> 01:29:50,665
[SPEAKER_07]: The retard one doesn't work.

1229
01:29:50,705 --> 01:29:51,225
[SPEAKER_07]: You can have it back.

1230
01:29:51,305 --> 01:29:52,166
[SPEAKER_25]: I throw like a girl.

1231
01:29:52,186 --> 01:29:52,406
[SPEAKER_25]: Sorry.

1232
01:29:52,446 --> 01:29:54,548
[SPEAKER_25]: The retard one died of complications.

1233
01:29:55,088 --> 01:29:55,889
[SPEAKER_07]: It died of crabs.

1234
01:29:55,949 --> 01:29:57,490
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, somebody stapled this one.

1235
01:29:57,510 --> 01:29:59,111
[SPEAKER_25]: Somebody did an operation on this one.

1236
01:29:59,132 --> 01:30:00,893
[SPEAKER_25]: That was mine because I had to.

1237
01:30:01,073 --> 01:30:03,495

[SPEAKER_24]: We're going to go to a break, and when we come back, I want to talk a little bit about some of those other releases that came out tonight.

1240
01:30:22,693 --> 01:30:28,256
[SPEAKER_24]: In fact, stuff that I know nothing about, so I'm going to try and call somebody over the Skype line to kind of talk about it a little bit.

1241
01:30:29,156 --> 01:30:36,000
[SPEAKER_24]: But in the meantime, we're going to go to a break with some more music from Ultramix 2, DDR, and then the Cage Match as well.

1242
01:30:36,460 --> 01:30:41,243
[SPEAKER_24]: I Spy is the first song we're going to hear in this break, as well as I'm in Heaven and Istanbul Cafe.

1243
01:30:41,283 --> 01:30:41,703
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll be back.

[SPEAKER_06]: What show?

1254
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:53,324
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they play a lot of great Fermanian video game music, but if you listen to it, you have to listen to it again within seven days.

1255
01:35:53,724 --> 01:35:55,005
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, I've heard of that station.

1256

1257
01:35:55,845 --> 01:35:57,946

1258
01:35:58,427 --> 01:36:00,708
[SPEAKER_24]: Hey, what happens to you if you don't listen to it again?

1267
01:36:23,064 --> 01:36:28,607
[SPEAKER_24]: Including I Spy, I'm in Heaven, and Istanbul Cafe.

1268
01:36:29,848 --> 01:36:32,329
[SPEAKER_24]: He says he's contemplating giving it away as a Christmas gift.

1269
01:36:32,469 --> 01:36:33,189
[SPEAKER_24]: Isn't that cute?

1270
01:36:33,209 --> 01:36:34,530
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

1271
01:36:37,912 --> 01:36:39,432
[SPEAKER_24]: What?

1272
01:36:39,612 --> 01:36:39,852

01:37:30,239 --> 01:37:37,483
[SPEAKER_24]: All right, we are going to get to the cage match in a little bit, but first off, I want to talk a little bit about 2DX8Style, because that's a huge thing that's coming out, right?

1275
01:37:37,543 --> 01:37:39,284
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, it came out already in Japan.

1276
01:37:39,805 --> 01:37:45,228
[SPEAKER_24]: It's exciting because it has some 2DX Red songs that are unlockable in it, including Spiral Galaxy is one of the songs.

1277
01:37:45,888 --> 01:37:48,070
[SPEAKER_24]: And then there's these great new consumer songs.

1278
01:37:48,110 --> 01:37:50,891
[SPEAKER_24]: I definitely want to play one of the new consumer songs for you.

1279
01:37:50,931 --> 01:37:53,613
[SPEAKER_24]: But first, I thought maybe we'd give somebody a call.

1280
01:37:54,073 --> 01:37:59,495
[SPEAKER_24]: that knows a little bit more about this stuff than I do because I haven't really been following the 8-Style News.

1281
01:37:59,535 --> 01:38:01,116
[SPEAKER_24]: Jamie, have you been following the 8-Style News at all?

1282
01:38:02,556 --> 01:38:03,717
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of, sort of.

1283
01:38:03,957 --> 01:38:05,278
[SPEAKER_07]: I honestly haven't had time.

1284
01:38:05,438 --> 01:38:06,398
[SPEAKER_24]: Loki, have you at all?

1285
01:38:07,759 --> 01:38:08,259
[SPEAKER_25]: A little bit.

1286
01:38:08,599 --> 01:38:12,801
[SPEAKER_24]: Arcadian, I know you have a little bit, but... He's trying to find the mic.

1287
01:38:13,921 --> 01:38:14,441
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, a little bit.

1288
01:38:14,461 --> 01:38:17,002
[SPEAKER_06]: I read a little bit of stuff, but... Sounds exciting from what you hear?

1289
01:38:17,583 --> 01:38:18,163
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, sounds pretty cool.

1290
01:38:18,183 --> 01:38:18,583
[SPEAKER_24]: All right.

1291
01:38:19,090 --> 01:38:22,993
[SPEAKER_24]: Let's see what our buddy DarkLionXVI has to say about 2DX.

1292
01:38:23,033 --> 01:38:24,694
[SPEAKER_24]: We've talked to him about 2DX before.

1293
01:38:26,115 --> 01:38:26,415
[SPEAKER_24]: Hello?

1294
01:38:27,136 --> 01:38:27,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, Sky.

1295
01:38:27,956 --> 01:38:28,917
[SPEAKER_24]: Hi, is this Ziggy?

1296
01:38:29,558 --> 01:38:29,778
[SPEAKER_24]: Yep.

1297
01:38:29,978 --> 01:38:30,758
[SPEAKER_24]: Hey, how you doing?

1298
01:38:31,499 --> 01:38:32,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Doing fine.

1299
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:32,840
[SPEAKER_24]: All right.

1300
01:38:34,661 --> 01:38:36,523
[SPEAKER_24]: Where's your copy of 2DX8Style?

1301
01:38:36,963 --> 01:38:39,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's already in the UPS office here in Vegas.

1302
01:38:39,685 --> 01:38:41,266
[SPEAKER_04]: They won't deliver it until tomorrow.

1303
01:38:41,526 --> 01:38:43,688
[SPEAKER_24]: Don't you just want to go break in and get it?

1304
01:38:44,774 --> 01:38:45,474
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think so.

1305
01:38:45,754 --> 01:38:46,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a good idea.

1306
01:38:46,475 --> 01:38:47,495
[SPEAKER_24]: He doesn't want to get busted.

1307
01:38:47,935 --> 01:38:51,256
[SPEAKER_24]: So tell us about some of the things we have to look forward to in 2DX8 style.

1308
01:38:52,216 --> 01:38:57,138
[SPEAKER_04]: The main menu's interface is like DDR Extreme US's Song Select Wheel.

1309
01:38:57,918 --> 01:38:58,338
[SPEAKER_24]: Really?

1310
01:38:58,818 --> 01:38:59,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1311
01:38:59,998 --> 01:39:02,679
[SPEAKER_24]: Wait, it has the Song Select Wheel from EXUS?

1312
01:39:02,739 --> 01:39:03,019
[SPEAKER_24]: What?

1313
01:39:03,699 --> 01:39:03,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1314
01:39:04,520 --> 01:39:04,940
[SPEAKER_24]: Wow.

1315
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:05,860
[SPEAKER_24]: That's crazy.

1316
01:39:05,880 --> 01:39:06,880
[SPEAKER_24]: I didn't know about that one, huh?

1317
01:39:08,121 --> 01:39:09,461
[SPEAKER_24]: Does it have iToy support, too?

1318
01:39:10,581 --> 01:39:10,921
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

1319
01:39:11,922 --> 01:39:12,642
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, well, that's good.

1320
01:39:13,755 --> 01:39:15,837
[SPEAKER_24]: What about some of the new unlocks, some of the new songs?

1321
01:39:16,778 --> 01:39:20,021
[SPEAKER_04]: About the unlocks thing, Spiral Galaxy and Taiyou.

1322
01:39:21,462 --> 01:39:25,246
[SPEAKER_04]: You can unlock them by playing all of the eight style songs, including the exclusives.

1323
01:39:25,446 --> 01:39:26,567
[SPEAKER_04]: However, there's a catch.

1324
01:39:26,848 --> 01:39:28,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Do not use easy.

1325
01:39:30,131 --> 01:39:31,892
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, what happens if you do use easy?

1326
01:39:31,912 --> 01:39:32,473
[SPEAKER_24]: You're screwed?

1327
01:39:34,275 --> 01:39:36,757
[SPEAKER_04]: You cannot be able to unlock it.

1328
01:39:37,262 --> 01:39:47,191
[SPEAKER_24]: It has to be normal or hard mode.

1329
01:39:48,072 --> 01:39:52,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I haven't heard much, even Everyday Lovely Day or Nebula Grasper.

1330
01:39:52,296 --> 01:39:53,537
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to try to get it tonight.

1331
01:39:53,757 --> 01:39:57,180
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, we're going to play some of them actually here right after I'm done talking to you.

1332
01:39:59,922 --> 01:40:02,265
[SPEAKER_24]: I absolutely love Everyday Lovely Days, so we're going to play that one.

1333
01:40:02,285 --> 01:40:05,589
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll probably throw in Nebula Grass first as well, because I know that's one a lot of people are looking forward to.

1334
01:40:06,390 --> 01:40:07,952
[SPEAKER_24]: LED looks like he's back.

1335
01:40:08,012 --> 01:40:10,274
[SPEAKER_24]: There were rumors that he left, but he came back.

1336
01:40:10,315 --> 01:40:11,556
[SPEAKER_24]: Do you know anything about that?

1337
01:40:12,437 --> 01:40:15,601
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I haven't been browsing around Vermont-y style about that.

1338
01:40:16,322 --> 01:40:16,582
[SPEAKER_24]: Huh.

1339
01:40:17,923 --> 01:40:18,344
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright, well.

1340
01:40:19,268 --> 01:40:23,472
[SPEAKER_24]: I was just curious, because a lot of people were saying that LED had left, and now all of a sudden he's got all these songs again.

1341
01:40:23,552 --> 01:40:25,814
[SPEAKER_24]: So, if he did leave, he came back pretty quick.

1342
01:40:25,874 --> 01:40:26,895
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know what happened there.

1343
01:40:27,355 --> 01:40:28,516
[SPEAKER_04]: And one more thing.

1344
01:40:28,756 --> 01:40:28,956
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

1345
01:40:29,297 --> 01:40:37,984
[SPEAKER_04]: About... On the record, it doesn't show the complete listings of your current scores, the progress.

1346
01:40:39,045 --> 01:40:40,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Konami somehow removed that.

1347
01:40:40,746 --> 01:40:41,007
[SPEAKER_24]: Huh.

1348
01:40:42,228 --> 01:40:42,728
[SPEAKER_24]: That's weird.

1349
01:40:43,329 --> 01:40:43,729
[SPEAKER_24]: Interesting.

1350
01:40:44,269 --> 01:40:47,292
[SPEAKER_24]: Like, if you've beaten the song, or what?

1351
01:40:48,143 --> 01:40:55,469
[SPEAKER_04]: No, just like shows your grades, just grades, grades, like the records of each individual sounds.

1352
01:40:55,489 --> 01:40:57,330
[SPEAKER_04]: They might have taken that out.

1353
01:40:57,730 --> 01:40:58,891
[SPEAKER_24]: Weird.

1354
01:40:58,951 --> 01:41:01,433
[SPEAKER_24]: You're getting some feedback in the chat room there.

1355
01:41:01,513 --> 01:41:04,696
[SPEAKER_24]: Jason says, what does he mean the EXUS song wheel?

1356
01:41:04,756 --> 01:41:05,837
[SPEAKER_24]: What do you mean by that?

1357
01:41:05,897 --> 01:41:07,678
[SPEAKER_24]: He said it's 8th style arcade authentic.

1358
01:41:09,640 --> 01:41:10,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me try to find that picture.

1359
01:41:12,993 --> 01:41:15,155
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's in Bimani style.

1360
01:41:15,355 --> 01:41:16,796
[SPEAKER_24]: He found a picture of it somewhere, okay.

1361
01:41:17,376 --> 01:41:19,317
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, maybe, are you sure it's just not a Photoshop?

1362
01:41:19,337 --> 01:41:20,958
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a Photoshop.

1363
01:41:21,138 --> 01:41:22,920
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a real deal.

1364
01:41:23,140 --> 01:41:24,881
[SPEAKER_24]: Some of those kids over there love to Photoshop.

1365
01:41:26,242 --> 01:41:27,182
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright, we'll see.

1366
01:41:27,543 --> 01:41:29,784
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright, so Siggy's going to try and pull up that picture.

1367
01:41:30,024 --> 01:41:31,946
[SPEAKER_24]: When you find that link, could you post it in the chat room there?

1368
01:41:31,966 --> 01:41:32,366
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, I will.

1369
01:41:32,386 --> 01:41:35,668
[SPEAKER_24]: For some folks that are really curious about what's going on there.

1370
01:41:37,808 --> 01:41:40,629
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, here's the thing about AI and SVGL.

1371
01:41:40,929 --> 01:41:45,171
[SPEAKER_04]: As of last Wednesday, they have Beatmania 2DX11, 2DX Red on their machines.

1372
01:41:45,431 --> 01:41:46,071
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, very cool.

1373
01:41:46,592 --> 01:41:49,033
[SPEAKER_24]: I want to go down to Arcade... You know what, Sad?

1374
01:41:49,053 --> 01:41:55,516
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm going to be in LA tomorrow just for the day, but I'm not going to be able to go to Arcade Infinity.

1375
01:41:55,836 --> 01:41:57,357
[SPEAKER_24]: So I'm not going to be able to check it out for a while.

1376
01:41:57,417 --> 01:41:58,577
[SPEAKER_24]: But I do want to check the game out.

1377
01:41:58,677 --> 01:41:58,998
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll see.

1378
01:42:00,358 --> 01:42:00,598
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright.

1379
01:42:02,039 --> 01:42:03,220
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

1380
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:05,721
[SPEAKER_24]: Anything else exciting about 2DX Red that you've heard about?

1381
01:42:05,741 --> 01:42:05,961
[SPEAKER_24]: The new...

1382
01:42:07,661 --> 01:42:19,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, by the way, on 8th style, whether regular or limited edition, you will get a goalie cover of a 2DX Red e-amusement card featuring Daruma and Tsunaru.

1383
01:42:20,192 --> 01:42:21,093
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, cool.

1384
01:42:21,193 --> 01:42:23,375
[SPEAKER_24]: One of those little cards you can put... Oh, that's very cool.

1385
01:42:23,495 --> 01:42:23,835
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright.

1386
01:42:25,137 --> 01:42:30,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we getting any... AI is working on their 2DX e-amusement readers.

1387
01:42:32,163 --> 01:42:32,363
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

1388
01:42:34,439 --> 01:42:40,102
[SPEAKER_24]: Is the EMU's thing, were there extra songs that were available on 2DX for the EMU's thing?

1389
01:42:41,203 --> 01:42:46,886
[SPEAKER_04]: I never really got... Oh, they're probably from the network.

1390
01:42:47,526 --> 01:42:48,026
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, okay.

1391
01:42:50,007 --> 01:42:57,911
[SPEAKER_24]: I was just curious, because I know Poppin' Music usually has the e-mall songs that end up in the consumer style releases, but not so much 2DX, so I was curious.

1392
01:42:59,152 --> 01:43:01,513
[SPEAKER_24]: Anything else you want to share about what's going on in the 2DX world?

1393
01:43:02,310 --> 01:43:02,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, here it is.

1394
01:43:02,770 --> 01:43:03,671
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I found the picture.

1395
01:43:03,911 --> 01:43:04,911
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, okay, found the picture.

1396
01:43:05,171 --> 01:43:06,491
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to post it over.

1397
01:43:06,892 --> 01:43:12,594
[SPEAKER_24]: Because our chat room is seriously going WTF because some folks have played it and said it's arcade authentic.

1398
01:43:13,614 --> 01:43:18,476
[SPEAKER_24]: I had heard that the title screen was really weird, so maybe that has something to do with what's going on.

1399
01:43:18,496 --> 01:43:19,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the picture.

1400
01:43:19,656 --> 01:43:20,096
[SPEAKER_04]: I've linked it.

1401
01:43:20,536 --> 01:43:20,796
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

1402
01:43:20,816 --> 01:43:23,497
[SPEAKER_24]: All right, I'll have to take a look here.

1403
01:43:24,038 --> 01:43:25,318
[SPEAKER_24]: I've got to see this for myself here.

1404
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:54,837
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, oh, interesting, the way it's, is kind of across the top, oh, okay, that's kind of like, okay, kind of like the title screen, I see what you're talking about, okay, that's, that's what it is, that funky new menu, like the main menu, where you choose, like, expert, beginner, how it kind of has that, yeah, this one's featured in, I think the one right here on the picture right now, it's featured, I mean, it's chosen as Danny Ninte, or Fast Course, right,

1405
01:43:55,868 --> 01:43:56,388
[SPEAKER_24]: Very interesting.

1406
01:43:56,408 --> 01:43:58,890
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, I'd heard that the title screen was a little different there.

1407
01:43:58,910 --> 01:43:59,530
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, that makes sense.

1408
01:43:59,550 --> 01:44:00,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's very different now.

1409
01:44:00,330 --> 01:44:03,632
[SPEAKER_24]: So, but once you get in and you pick the songs, it looks like 8th style.

1410
01:44:04,192 --> 01:44:04,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm.

1411
01:44:04,473 --> 01:44:04,973
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, that's good.

1412
01:44:05,073 --> 01:44:05,433
[SPEAKER_24]: That's good.

1413
01:44:05,553 --> 01:44:06,454
[SPEAKER_24]: And no iToySupport.

1414
01:44:07,154 --> 01:44:07,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know.

1415
01:44:09,195 --> 01:44:09,455
[SPEAKER_24]: All right.

1416
01:44:09,575 --> 01:44:15,719
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's also a high-speed setting where you individually choose a song on which high-speed you want.

1417
01:44:16,119 --> 01:44:17,019
[SPEAKER_24]: I had heard about that.

1418
01:44:17,139 --> 01:44:17,920
[SPEAKER_24]: That's so good.

1419
01:44:17,940 --> 01:44:20,981
[SPEAKER_24]: Like, in the expert courses and stuff, you can do a separate high-speed for each song?

1420
01:44:21,021 --> 01:44:21,862
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do that, too.

1421
01:44:22,674 --> 01:44:30,564
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, thank God, because that needed that, because I would hate having a non-stop course, and then, like, I would have, like, Dune, and then I'd have to do 250 BPM.

1422
01:44:30,945 --> 01:44:31,525
[SPEAKER_24]: Sucks.

1423
01:44:31,645 --> 01:44:32,226
[SPEAKER_04]: Expert mode.

1424
01:44:32,727 --> 01:44:33,007
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

1425
01:44:33,888 --> 01:44:34,269
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright.

1426
01:44:34,489 --> 01:44:34,950
[SPEAKER_24]: Very cool.

1427
01:44:35,030 --> 01:44:36,311
[SPEAKER_24]: Anything else you want to share about 2DX?

1428
01:44:36,351 --> 01:44:36,752
[SPEAKER_24]: What's going on?

1429
01:44:37,973 --> 01:44:40,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's the only thing I can share.

1430
01:44:40,635 --> 01:44:46,080
[SPEAKER_04]: When I do get my copy of 8th style, I'll give you pictures, even a clip of me playing dancer.

1431
01:44:46,841 --> 01:44:47,802
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, yes, my favorite song.

1432
01:44:47,822 --> 01:44:48,723
[SPEAKER_24]: All right, definitely.

1433
01:44:48,803 --> 01:44:51,005
[SPEAKER_24]: And we want to talk to you guys, talk to you a little bit more.

1434
01:44:51,426 --> 01:44:54,969
[SPEAKER_24]: When I say you guys, I mean the listeners in general about your thoughts on 8th style when you get it.

1435
01:44:55,029 --> 01:44:56,150
[SPEAKER_24]: And we'll give you our thoughts as well.

1436
01:44:56,851 --> 01:44:57,091
[SPEAKER_24]: All right.

1437
01:44:57,191 --> 01:44:57,411
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

1438
01:44:57,692 --> 01:44:57,872
[SPEAKER_24]: All right.

1439
01:44:57,892 --> 01:44:59,073
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, thanks for letting us bug you, Siggy.

1440
01:44:59,093 --> 01:44:59,494
[SPEAKER_24]: Have a good one.

1441
01:44:59,994 --> 01:45:00,274
[SPEAKER_24]: All right.

1442
01:45:00,354 --> 01:45:00,575
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1443
01:45:00,615 --> 01:45:00,795
[SPEAKER_11]: Later.

1444
01:45:01,806 --> 01:45:04,148
[SPEAKER_24]: All right, some information there on 2DX8style.

1445
01:45:04,209 --> 01:45:09,174
[SPEAKER_24]: Scared everybody a little bit with that comparison to EXUSA, but it looks like it's just the menu.

1446
01:45:09,354 --> 01:45:10,015
[SPEAKER_24]: Don't worry, kids.

1447
01:45:10,275 --> 01:45:11,556
[SPEAKER_24]: Everything else is still just the same.

1448
01:45:11,897 --> 01:45:12,637
[SPEAKER_24]: Don't freak out on me.

1449
01:45:13,218 --> 01:45:16,902
[SPEAKER_24]: All right, speaking of 2DX8style, there's some great new consumer songs.

1450
01:45:17,902 --> 01:45:21,184
[SPEAKER_24]: It's so nice to see the return of consumer songs in 2DX.

1451
01:45:21,504 --> 01:45:24,165
[SPEAKER_24]: So we're going to play a couple of those for you guys right now.

1452
01:45:25,225 --> 01:45:28,726
[SPEAKER_24]: My favorite song, Everyday Lovely Day, the LED style mix.

1453
01:45:28,766 --> 01:45:29,267
[SPEAKER_24]: I love this song.

1454
01:45:29,807 --> 01:45:31,928
[SPEAKER_24]: And Nebula Grasper, because that's a really popular one, too.

1455
01:45:31,948 --> 01:45:35,089
[SPEAKER_24]: We're going to play those songs, and then we'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio.

1456
01:45:35,129 --> 01:45:35,529
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll be back.

1457
01:49:37,250 --> 01:49:38,873
[SPEAKER_24]: And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1458
01:49:38,893 --> 01:49:45,745
[SPEAKER_24]: That was a preview of some songs from 2DX8style, some new consumer tracks there, Everyday Lovely Day, and Nebula Grasper.

1459
01:49:47,708 --> 01:49:48,248
[SPEAKER_24]: Very cool.

1460
01:49:48,889 --> 01:49:54,893
[SPEAKER_24]: Anyway, we are back and also being released this week, DDR Festival and Poppin' Music 10.

1461
01:49:55,513 --> 01:49:57,615
[SPEAKER_24]: Don't know a whole lot about Poppin' Music 10 yet.

1462
01:49:57,695 --> 01:50:03,959
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm not up on the Poppin' Music scene, to be honest, but I'm going to try and get Navi back here on the show after he's gotten a chance to play the copy.

1463
01:50:04,439 --> 01:50:07,421
[SPEAKER_24]: I did hear the Akumajo Dracula medleys in it, which makes me very happy.

1464
01:50:07,502 --> 01:50:08,442
[SPEAKER_07]: That makes me go squee.

1465
01:50:08,722 --> 01:50:08,922
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

1466
01:50:09,463 --> 01:50:11,925
[SPEAKER_24]: I guess it's one of the email songs that's in there, so it's very awesome.

1467
01:50:12,965 --> 01:50:19,350
[SPEAKER_24]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1468
01:50:35,681 --> 01:50:37,243
[SPEAKER_24]: I figure there's not too much of a point.

1469
01:50:37,323 --> 01:50:45,690
[SPEAKER_24]: But for those people that don't have an Xbox, but they do have a JPS2, it's kind of a first chance for them to take a look at some new songs and also the new interface.

1470
01:50:45,730 --> 01:50:46,611
[SPEAKER_24]: So, you know, pretty good.

1471
01:50:46,991 --> 01:50:47,972
[SPEAKER_24]: Just pros and cons.

1472
01:50:48,012 --> 01:50:50,094
[SPEAKER_24]: Just all depends on what you're looking for in a DDR mix.

1473
01:50:50,934 --> 01:50:54,638
[SPEAKER_24]: I'll bet you anything, though, whatever they release next year will have some of the Ultramix 2 stuff in it.

1474
01:50:55,338 --> 01:50:55,739
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll see.

1475
01:50:56,699 --> 01:50:57,300
[SPEAKER_24]: I could be wrong.

1476
01:50:57,560 --> 01:50:58,241
[SPEAKER_24]: Wouldn't be the first time.

1477
01:50:58,261 --> 01:50:58,601
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll see.

1478
01:50:59,282 --> 01:50:59,542
[SPEAKER_24]: All right.

1479
01:51:00,478 --> 01:51:00,598
[SPEAKER_24]: TACO?

1480
01:51:00,638 --> 01:51:00,758
[SPEAKER_24]: TACO?

1481
01:51:30,433 --> 01:51:33,338
[SPEAKER_24]: Last week in the Orange Lounge Radio cage match.

1482
01:51:34,679 --> 01:51:37,220
[SPEAKER_24]: I took a risk by putting in a top 40 song.

1483
01:51:37,800 --> 01:51:38,821
[SPEAKER_24]: And what do you know, it worked.

1484
01:51:38,981 --> 01:51:40,142
[SPEAKER_24]: You guys voted at the winner.

1485
01:51:40,722 --> 01:51:42,123
[SPEAKER_24]: It was Gwen Stefani.

1486
01:51:42,763 --> 01:51:45,404
[SPEAKER_24]: And the name of the song is What You Waitin' For.

1487
01:51:46,144 --> 01:51:47,225
[SPEAKER_24]: And that was last week's winner.

1488
01:51:47,285 --> 01:51:48,886
[SPEAKER_24]: Remember the way the cage match works?

1489
01:51:48,926 --> 01:51:55,409
[SPEAKER_24]: You hear a clip of last week's winner and two brand new songs in their entirety as chosen by the Orange Lounge Radio hosts.

1490
01:51:55,749 --> 01:51:57,970
[SPEAKER_24]: And then you vote on your favorite in our chat room.

1491
01:51:58,010 --> 01:52:02,192
[SPEAKER_24]: And the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio Live.

1492
01:52:02,679 --> 01:52:03,701
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright, so here we go.

1493
01:52:03,761 --> 01:52:05,924
[SPEAKER_24]: Let's start it off with song number one tonight.

1494
01:52:05,964 --> 01:52:08,688
[SPEAKER_24]: It's a clip of Gwen Stefani with Whatcha Waiting For.

1495
01:52:49,275 --> 01:52:51,597
Thank you for watching!

1496
01:53:19,711 --> 01:53:33,817

1497
01:53:50,849 --> 01:53:53,750
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright, that was a clip of song number one in tonight's cage match.

1498
01:53:53,770 --> 01:53:55,350
[SPEAKER_24]: Gwen Stefani, what you waiting for?

1499
01:53:55,470 --> 01:53:56,170
[SPEAKER_24]: Last week's winner.

1500
01:53:56,230 --> 01:54:00,452
[SPEAKER_24]: Song number two in tonight's cage match comes to us courtesy of DarkSakura.

1501
01:54:00,852 --> 01:54:02,492
[SPEAKER_24]: DarkSakura, what did you pick out for us tonight?

1502
01:54:04,112 --> 01:54:06,613
[SPEAKER_07]: I picked a song that was in Amplitude.

1503
01:54:06,633 --> 01:54:07,693
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1504
01:54:08,954 --> 01:54:10,894
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm pretty sure we haven't done this one before.

1505
01:54:10,914 --> 01:54:11,794
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think so either.

1506
01:54:12,174 --> 01:54:13,915
[SPEAKER_24]: I would remember a band name like Manchild.

1507
01:54:15,002 --> 01:54:16,483
[SPEAKER_07]: Man Child Nitro Narcosis

1508
01:54:57,125 --> 01:54:57,868
Thanks for watching!

1509
01:57:17,922 --> 01:57:18,302
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh yeah!

1510
01:58:48,703 --> 01:58:50,904
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright, that was song number two in tonight's cage match.

1511
01:58:50,924 --> 01:58:53,565
[SPEAKER_24]: That was Manchild with Nitro Narcosis.

1512
01:58:53,605 --> 01:58:58,167
[SPEAKER_24]: Let's go around and see what everybody thought of that one, starting off with Jamie.

1513
01:58:58,928 --> 01:59:00,348
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought that song was pretty cool.

1514
01:59:00,448 --> 01:59:03,650
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually fun to listen to when you're driving.

1515
01:59:04,490 --> 01:59:09,292
[SPEAKER_07]: So it gives a 9 for the speed limit.

1516
01:59:09,312 --> 01:59:10,172
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going 90.

1517
01:59:12,393 --> 01:59:15,835
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright, let's go over to Arcadian42 and see what Arcadian thought.

1518
01:59:16,667 --> 01:59:23,294
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll give it a 9, because it sounded pretty good.

1519
01:59:23,634 --> 01:59:24,575
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright, 9 from Arcadian.

1520
01:59:24,595 --> 01:59:24,976
[SPEAKER_24]: Jonas?

1521
01:59:27,078 --> 01:59:27,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'll give it a 9.

1522
01:59:27,778 --> 01:59:28,539
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds pretty good.

1523
01:59:28,619 --> 01:59:29,961
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a good beat to it.

1524
01:59:30,701 --> 01:59:32,563
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright, a 9 from Explicit as well.

1525
01:59:32,703 --> 01:59:33,244
[SPEAKER_24]: And Loki?

1526
01:59:34,443 --> 01:59:34,903
[SPEAKER_11]: I liked it.

1527
01:59:35,184 --> 01:59:35,664
[SPEAKER_24]: I give it a 9.

1528
01:59:36,925 --> 01:59:42,870
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright, then, uh, wow, everybody gave it a 9, but I'm sorry to break the trend, but I only thought it was kind of okay.

1529
01:59:43,111 --> 01:59:45,413
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, there's just songs in Amplitude I like better than that one.

1530
01:59:46,394 --> 01:59:47,014
[SPEAKER_24]: I give it a 5.

1531
01:59:47,114 --> 01:59:49,356
[SPEAKER_07]: We've already picked them for Cage Matches.

1532
01:59:50,037 --> 01:59:52,899
[SPEAKER_24]: I know, sorry, I just, I didn't dig that one as much, sorry.

1533
01:59:53,179 --> 01:59:53,620
[SPEAKER_24]: I give it a 5.

1534
01:59:54,120 --> 01:59:56,723
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright, let's go on to song number 3 in tonight's Cage Match.

1535
01:59:56,803 --> 01:59:59,465
[SPEAKER_24]: It comes to us from Loki, and Loki, what did you pick tonight?

1536
02:00:00,998 --> 02:00:05,642
[SPEAKER_25]: I didn't really have anything, so I just picked a song that I just happened to have lying around.

1537
02:00:06,463 --> 02:00:15,130
[SPEAKER_25]: This is another DM Ashura song, a remix between A and AA, so obviously this would be AAA.

1538
02:00:17,152 --> 02:00:22,496
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, here we go, and I love how you just let our listeners know that you're just not even trying anymore.

1539
02:00:23,717 --> 02:00:27,801
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, I have another song that's decent that I could put in instead, but you already have that song, so...

1540
02:00:29,841 --> 02:00:35,037
[SPEAKER_24]: All righty then, here it is, DJ Amuro remixed by DM Ishura with A.A.A.

1541
02:00:35,298 --> 02:00:35,578
[SPEAKER_24]: Enjoy.

1542
02:01:49,304 --> 02:01:50,045
Thank you for watching!

1543
02:02:49,284 --> 02:02:50,146
Thanks for watching!

1544
02:03:56,571 --> 02:03:58,672
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright, that was song number three in tonight's cage match.

1545
02:03:58,752 --> 02:04:03,533
[SPEAKER_24]: DJ Amoro remixed by DM Asherah with Triple A. Jimmy!

1546
02:04:04,914 --> 02:04:08,855
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounded like A to C. It wasn't bad, though, at all.

1547
02:04:12,757 --> 02:04:19,279
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really hard to put my finger on it, because it's just something that...

1548
02:04:20,911 --> 02:04:30,716
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it was, you know, when you hear that fast drum beat pick up to another part that like everybody in God uses, it sort of sounded like there's just recycled tricks in it.

1549
02:04:31,216 --> 02:04:31,996
[SPEAKER_07]: But it wasn't bad.

1550
02:04:33,177 --> 02:04:34,537
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'd have to give it a 7.5.

1551
02:04:34,717 --> 02:04:36,718
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright, 7.5 from Jamie.

1552
02:04:36,918 --> 02:04:37,359
[SPEAKER_24]: Arcadian?

1553
02:04:39,379 --> 02:04:41,220
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounded pretty good.

1554
02:04:41,480 --> 02:04:43,181
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd give it like 8.5.

1555
02:04:43,361 --> 02:04:44,102
[SPEAKER_24]: 8.5 from Arcadian.

1556
02:04:44,142 --> 02:04:44,522
[SPEAKER_24]: Jonas?

1557
02:04:46,283 --> 02:04:47,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it sounds pretty good.

1558
02:04:47,563 --> 02:04:49,144
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some flaws with it, like

1559
02:04:49,482 --> 02:04:52,703
[SPEAKER_03]: There's like some recycled samples and sound effects.

1560
02:04:54,604 --> 02:04:56,445
[SPEAKER_03]: And, well, I don't know.

1561
02:04:56,465 --> 02:05:00,747
[SPEAKER_03]: It also sounds like some of the elements used in previous DM Assures work as well.

1562
02:05:01,747 --> 02:05:02,688
[SPEAKER_03]: I respect DM Assures.

1563
02:05:03,826 --> 02:05:08,287
[SPEAKER_03]: works a lot because he's done so much for remixing good remixes.

1564
02:05:09,247 --> 02:05:12,768
[SPEAKER_24]: As opposed to Paranoia, Cowgirl, Survivor, Max.

1565
02:05:13,368 --> 02:05:13,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Ew.

1566
02:05:14,768 --> 02:05:21,309
[SPEAKER_03]: Or that 1, 2, 3, 4, Max, Honeycrap that we heard somebody play at the station.

1567
02:05:21,869 --> 02:05:24,990
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have to say, it is not a Max remix.

1568
02:05:25,590 --> 02:05:28,030
[SPEAKER_03]: For the love of God.

1569
02:05:29,450 --> 02:05:31,291
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I might actually do a pinfall for this.

1570
02:05:31,371 --> 02:05:32,191
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll just give it an 8.

1571
02:05:32,990 --> 02:05:34,572
[SPEAKER_24]: All right, an eight from Jonas.

1572
02:05:34,932 --> 02:05:35,232
[SPEAKER_25]: Loki.

1573
02:05:37,034 --> 02:05:39,717
[SPEAKER_25]: I would pretend to be excited, but I'm not, so I don't care.

1574
02:05:40,418 --> 02:05:41,299
[SPEAKER_25]: Whatever.

1575
02:05:42,099 --> 02:05:44,462
[SPEAKER_25]: It gets a triple A because, yeah.

1576
02:05:45,043 --> 02:05:45,783
[SPEAKER_25]: Whatever, I don't care.

1577
02:05:45,903 --> 02:05:46,104
[SPEAKER_25]: Nine.

1578
02:05:48,066 --> 02:05:52,931
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sure that made a lot of fanboys and girls very moist in their nether regions, but I don't know.

1579
02:05:53,891 --> 02:05:54,812
[SPEAKER_24]: It just didn't do it for me.

1580
02:05:54,832 --> 02:05:56,453
[SPEAKER_24]: It didn't have the same charm of the original.

1581
02:05:56,533 --> 02:05:57,214
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, it was cool.

1582
02:05:57,274 --> 02:05:57,935
[SPEAKER_24]: It wasn't bad.

1583
02:05:57,995 --> 02:05:58,615
[SPEAKER_24]: Don't get me wrong.

1584
02:05:58,996 --> 02:06:04,060
[SPEAKER_24]: So I was going to give it a 6, but Jonas brought up a very good point in the fact that it's not a max 300 mix.

1585
02:06:04,381 --> 02:06:05,702
[SPEAKER_24]: And for that, I give it a bonus point.

1586
02:06:05,742 --> 02:06:07,083
[SPEAKER_24]: So I give it a 7 overall.

1587
02:06:07,524 --> 02:06:07,884
[SPEAKER_24]: All right.

1588
02:06:08,364 --> 02:06:08,845
[SPEAKER_24]: But you know what?

1589
02:06:08,885 --> 02:06:10,046
[SPEAKER_24]: It doesn't matter what we think.

1590
02:06:10,086 --> 02:06:11,027
[SPEAKER_24]: It matters what you think.

1591
02:06:11,087 --> 02:06:13,189
[SPEAKER_24]: So you guys can vote in our chat room.

1592
02:06:13,229 --> 02:06:16,792
[SPEAKER_24]: Here are the three songs, one more time, that you can vote for tonight in tonight's cage match.

1593
02:06:17,112 --> 02:06:18,494
[SPEAKER_24]: Gwen Stefani, what you waiting for?

1594
02:06:28,139 --> 02:06:31,501
[SPEAKER_24]: And song number two tonight, Manchild with Nitro Narcosis.

1595
02:06:41,888 --> 02:06:47,172
[SPEAKER_24]: And song number three tonight, DJ Amuro, remixed by DM Ashura with Triple A.

1596
02:06:57,802 --> 02:07:01,306
[SPEAKER_24]: All right, guys, place vote now.

1597
02:07:01,526 --> 02:07:12,157
[SPEAKER_24]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote, and your votes will be counted up, and we will reveal the winner shortly, as soon as we get all the votes.

1598
02:07:13,198 --> 02:07:14,139
[SPEAKER_24]: All right, in the meantime...

1599
02:07:15,914 --> 02:07:16,134
[SPEAKER_24]: DM Ashura

1600
02:07:29,396 --> 02:07:34,420
[SPEAKER_25]: Step Mania's Urbanized theme, which is a little bit different than most of the other themes out there.

1601
02:07:34,440 --> 02:07:36,061
[SPEAKER_25]: It's kind of a neat look to it.

1602
02:07:37,082 --> 02:07:38,643
[SPEAKER_25]: There's dancing characters for you.

1603
02:07:38,824 --> 02:07:40,405
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, the dancing characters there are.

1604
02:07:41,245 --> 02:07:46,870
[SPEAKER_25]: There's a skin edit of Emi and Halas Emi that...

1605
02:07:47,370 --> 02:07:48,291
[SPEAKER_25]: Master Chief from Halo

1606
02:08:18,444 --> 02:08:20,726
[SPEAKER_24]: Did they ever fix the Mr. Spanky dancing character?

1607
02:08:20,746 --> 02:08:22,968
[SPEAKER_24]: I think I remember that there were issues with it or something.

1608
02:08:24,029 --> 02:08:24,609
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, it fixed.

1609
02:08:26,771 --> 02:08:29,414
[SPEAKER_25]: It was just a bad file or something.

1610
02:08:31,015 --> 02:08:32,156
[SPEAKER_25]: But it works now.

1611
02:08:32,616 --> 02:08:38,542
[SPEAKER_25]: Mr. Spanky can dance around like crazy.

1612
02:08:39,382 --> 02:08:42,325
[SPEAKER_24]: Have there been any new skins for Step Mania recently?

1613
02:08:42,425 --> 02:08:45,628
[SPEAKER_24]: I notice you still hoard that Technofield one, but has there been anything new?

1614
02:08:47,903 --> 02:08:49,063
[SPEAKER_25]: Techno Fiend, whatever.

1615
02:09:01,690 --> 02:09:03,411
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know, some other ones that are being worked on.

1616
02:09:03,851 --> 02:09:07,674
[SPEAKER_25]: They all kind of look the same, but the Urbanized one, Technofine are pretty good.

1617
02:09:09,315 --> 02:09:15,139
[SPEAKER_25]: There's supposedly work on Euromix 2, but I mean, that's pretty much just Max 2, so what's the big deal?

1618
02:09:15,960 --> 02:09:30,209
[SPEAKER_25]: Also, I forgot to mention, of course, you know, Festival, the new steps are being coded for that, and also for the new songs in Ultramix 2, and for the Dancing Sage Fusion stuff should be coming out eventually.

1619
02:09:32,170 --> 02:09:38,533
[SPEAKER_25]: It's a little easier to do it from Xbox because they can actually rip the steps and code them directly.

1620
02:09:38,693 --> 02:09:40,434
[SPEAKER_25]: So it makes it a little easier.

1621
02:09:42,135 --> 02:09:46,737
[SPEAKER_25]: So look for those that hit DDRUK at some point relatively soon.

1622
02:09:47,918 --> 02:09:50,079
[SPEAKER_25]: Other than that, really not too much else.

1623
02:09:50,939 --> 02:09:55,161
[SPEAKER_25]: If you want to go find some good skins for Step Maniac, go to DDR Maniacs.

1624
02:09:55,261 --> 02:09:56,722
[SPEAKER_25]: Go to their Step Maniac forum.

1625
02:09:57,042 --> 02:09:58,523
[SPEAKER_25]: There's a whole section for themes.

1626
02:09:58,923 --> 02:10:00,807
[SPEAKER_25]: and there's a ton that are being worked on right now.

1627
02:10:01,307 --> 02:10:03,651
[SPEAKER_25]: And they even have a whole thread of ones that are finished.

1628
02:10:03,851 --> 02:10:06,135
[SPEAKER_25]: And there's plenty for you to choose from.

1629
02:10:06,175 --> 02:10:08,860
[SPEAKER_25]: So just go look over there and you'll find them.

1630
02:10:10,803 --> 02:10:11,524
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright, sounds good.

1631
02:10:11,544 --> 02:10:13,167
[SPEAKER_24]: You guys want to know who won tonight's cage match?

1632
02:10:14,605 --> 02:10:15,165
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah!

1633
02:10:15,365 --> 02:10:16,926
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright, it was very close.

1634
02:10:17,086 --> 02:10:19,647
[SPEAKER_24]: It was won by one vote.

1635
02:10:20,208 --> 02:10:22,809
[SPEAKER_24]: And then the other song, it beat it by two votes.

1636
02:10:22,889 --> 02:10:24,730
[SPEAKER_24]: So it was all very, very neck and neck tonight.

1637
02:10:25,230 --> 02:10:27,891
[SPEAKER_24]: Tonight's winner, I think this is actually a bit of a surprise to me.

1638
02:10:27,931 --> 02:10:32,653
[SPEAKER_24]: Tonight's winner is... Gwen Stefani!

1639
02:10:34,554 --> 02:10:37,196
[SPEAKER_24]: For the second week in a row, if you can imagine that.

1640
02:10:38,116 --> 02:10:39,817
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, Loki says it's on.

1641
02:10:40,857 --> 02:10:42,178
[SPEAKER_25]: It's gone next week, trust me.

1642
02:10:43,038 --> 02:10:44,660
[SPEAKER_24]: I want four weeks in a row, man.

1643
02:10:44,680 --> 02:10:46,883
[SPEAKER_24]: I want Gwen Stefani to get retired, man.

1644
02:10:47,264 --> 02:10:47,825
[SPEAKER_24]: She's awesome.

1645
02:10:49,046 --> 02:10:49,527
[SPEAKER_24]: All right.

1646
02:10:49,867 --> 02:10:50,949
[SPEAKER_24]: By one vote.

1647
02:10:52,351 --> 02:10:52,851
[SPEAKER_24]: So close.

1648
02:10:53,392 --> 02:10:54,133
[SPEAKER_24]: Every vote counts.

1649
02:10:54,173 --> 02:10:54,674
[SPEAKER_24]: What can I say?

1650
02:10:55,495 --> 02:10:57,878
[SPEAKER_24]: We could have had a tie and somebody could have broken the tie, but no.

1651
02:10:58,239 --> 02:10:59,260
[SPEAKER_24]: One vote decided it all.

1652
02:11:00,606 --> 02:11:02,927
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, of course, everybody in chatroom is bitching about it.

1653
02:11:03,007 --> 02:11:03,767
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, hell no.

1654
02:11:04,267 --> 02:11:05,348
[SPEAKER_24]: Don't tell me that song won.

1655
02:11:05,808 --> 02:11:07,928
[SPEAKER_24]: Hey, you guys voted for it.

1656
02:11:07,968 --> 02:11:09,089
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm counting the votes right here.

1657
02:11:09,809 --> 02:11:14,291
[SPEAKER_24]: I think the people that voted for it are kind of hiding now because they see that the wrath is coming to get them.

1658
02:11:15,031 --> 02:11:15,311
[SPEAKER_24]: All right.

1659
02:11:15,571 --> 02:11:16,771
[SPEAKER_24]: They want to know what came in second.

1660
02:11:17,352 --> 02:11:22,233
[SPEAKER_24]: It was AAA by one vote, and then the other song was down by two votes.

1661
02:11:22,593 --> 02:11:24,854
[SPEAKER_24]: But all pretty much across the board.

1662
02:11:25,294 --> 02:11:26,234
[SPEAKER_24]: All pretty much across the board.

1663
02:11:27,135 --> 02:11:27,415
[SPEAKER_24]: All right.

1664
02:11:28,575 --> 02:11:31,797
[SPEAKER_24]: So we will see what happens next week in the Orange Lounge Cage Match.

1665
02:11:31,817 --> 02:11:35,159
[SPEAKER_24]: But for now, let's get back to Ultra Mix 2 songs, shall we?

1666
02:11:35,179 --> 02:11:37,461
[SPEAKER_24]: I think we can all agree that Ultra Mix 2 songs are pretty good.

1667
02:11:37,821 --> 02:11:40,123
[SPEAKER_24]: And in this break, we're going to hear... Ooh, my favorite one's in this break.

1668
02:11:40,163 --> 02:11:41,223
[SPEAKER_24]: One of my favorites.

1669
02:11:41,283 --> 02:11:42,904
[SPEAKER_24]: Toe Jam is in this break.

1670
02:11:43,284 --> 02:11:44,065
[SPEAKER_24]: This song's great.

1671
02:11:44,145 --> 02:11:45,466
[SPEAKER_24]: It's like a country song.

1672
02:11:45,866 --> 02:11:49,949
[SPEAKER_24]: And then Tough Enough by Vanilla Ninja we'll hear in this break, too, as well as Wherever You Are by Lava.

1673
02:11:50,269 --> 02:11:55,332
[SPEAKER_25]: And for those of you that play doubles, I hear the doubles light steps have a certain way you're supposed to play them.

1674
02:11:55,638 --> 02:11:58,099
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know what that means, but that's what I've been told.

1675
02:11:58,239 --> 02:11:59,300
[SPEAKER_24]: It means hoedown!

1676
02:11:59,580 --> 02:12:00,140
[SPEAKER_24]: Square dance!

1677
02:12:01,101 --> 02:12:01,381
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright.

1678
02:12:01,901 --> 02:12:02,381
[SPEAKER_24]: Here we go.

1679
02:12:02,522 --> 02:12:03,702
[SPEAKER_24]: We will be right back after this.

1680
02:12:25,813 --> 02:12:27,675
Music Music Music Music

1681
02:13:16,429 --> 02:13:17,970
Thanks for watching!

1682
02:13:48,705 --> 02:13:51,247
Baby, I'll be the strongest to survive

1683
02:14:20,067 --> 02:14:21,015
[SPEAKER_05]: S, Actdeft

1684
02:14:25,846 --> 02:14:26,987
[SPEAKER_16]: and the rest of the cast.

1685
02:14:57,350 --> 02:15:22,596
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't need you there, cause I need you there, all tonight Just keep on keeping the promise, if you don't come, don't be around, away, go for the fire, baby, that's tough enough Just keep on living strong, stop giving me doubt, don't be free, just get you in the deep of the heartbreak, baby, that's tough enough

1686
02:15:35,397 --> 02:15:36,789
Baby, I've had enough

1687
02:17:46,984 --> 02:17:49,145
[SPEAKER_24]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1688
02:17:49,185 --> 02:17:51,267
[SPEAKER_24]: Hope you're enjoying the Ultra Mix 2 songs we've been playing so far.

1689
02:17:51,287 --> 02:17:52,408
[SPEAKER_24]: What did you guys think of Toe Jam?

1690
02:17:54,190 --> 02:17:56,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Yee-haw, Ninja Cowboy.

1691
02:17:56,952 --> 02:17:58,974
[SPEAKER_24]: Which is funny because it was followed up by Vanilla Ninja.

1692
02:17:59,134 --> 02:17:59,394
[SPEAKER_24]: Uh-huh.

1693
02:18:00,250 --> 02:18:01,130
[SPEAKER_24]: What did you think of ToeJam?

1694
02:18:01,230 --> 02:18:04,592
[SPEAKER_24]: You guys explicit in our Acadian?

1695
02:18:09,253 --> 02:18:11,894
[SPEAKER_03]: It's country gone techno.

1696
02:18:13,355 --> 02:18:14,135
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you say, Loki?

1697
02:18:15,076 --> 02:18:15,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's Earl?

1698
02:18:16,536 --> 02:18:17,157
[SPEAKER_24]: Yuck, yuck, yuck.

1699
02:18:17,957 --> 02:18:18,317
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

1700
02:18:18,377 --> 02:18:20,838
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a ToeJam and Earl song in the pre-show.

1701
02:18:22,054 --> 02:18:22,434
[SPEAKER_24]: I heard that.

1702
02:18:22,914 --> 02:18:27,699
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, El Mullet made this funny realization in our chat room before the show, during the pre-show.

1703
02:18:27,719 --> 02:18:35,106
[SPEAKER_24]: He was talking about the song Toe Jam and he said, it's funny because there's a pun in there because, you know, you're jamming on your toes to the steps.

1704
02:18:35,326 --> 02:18:36,287
[SPEAKER_24]: Get it?

1705
02:18:36,307 --> 02:18:36,367
Huh?

1706
02:18:38,269 --> 02:18:38,529
[SPEAKER_24]: Funny.

1707
02:18:39,630 --> 02:18:40,110
[SPEAKER_24]: Funny stuff.

1708
02:18:41,011 --> 02:18:42,353
[SPEAKER_24]: Everybody's a comedian these days.

1709
02:18:42,987 --> 02:18:44,168
[SPEAKER_24]: Because we're sick and not going to take it.

1710
02:19:20,602 --> 02:19:27,044
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to offer a big F you to the Lexus van freshly purchased that was driving in front of me.

1711
02:19:27,584 --> 02:19:34,507
[SPEAKER_07]: Doing not the normal one to two car space that you're supposed to have, but doing like five car lengths.

1712
02:19:35,473 --> 02:19:37,455
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

1713
02:19:50,538 --> 02:19:52,078
[SPEAKER_07]: My angst knows no bounds.

1714
02:19:53,439 --> 02:19:56,279
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't have words to properly express it.

1715
02:19:57,160 --> 02:19:59,740
[SPEAKER_07]: So, uh, oh yeah, F you to this fucking paper!

1716
02:20:00,420 --> 02:20:01,161
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate you!

1717
02:20:01,801 --> 02:20:02,861
[SPEAKER_07]: Focus on ethics?

1718
02:20:03,281 --> 02:20:03,921
[SPEAKER_07]: What are those?

1719
02:20:05,402 --> 02:20:06,682
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but that's really about it.

1720
02:20:06,782 --> 02:20:15,844
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just sort of angsted out, so I'm gonna pass on the mic and release my anger in a more physical method by beating up, you know, an inanimate object.

1721
02:20:15,904 --> 02:20:17,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably a fact machine office face style.

1722
02:20:18,405 --> 02:20:18,705
[SPEAKER_24]: Awesome.

1723
02:20:19,369 --> 02:20:21,310
[SPEAKER_07]: I just need the gangsta rap replay in the background, you know?

1724
02:20:22,710 --> 02:20:28,553
[SPEAKER_24]: Remember, if you guys want to send in a nephew, send a private message to Sky in our chatroom right now while we move on to Loki.

1725
02:20:31,854 --> 02:20:35,255
[SPEAKER_25]: Fuck you to trees and the leaves that they drop.

1726
02:20:35,635 --> 02:20:37,516
[SPEAKER_25]: My God, there is literally like...

1727
02:20:38,942 --> 02:20:40,664
[SPEAKER_25]: A couple feet of leaves outside.

1728
02:20:40,884 --> 02:20:45,248
[SPEAKER_25]: We walk out there to my car, and there's literally a pile of leaves next to my car.

1729
02:20:45,648 --> 02:20:48,571
[SPEAKER_25]: I swear, if I leave my car there for a few more days, it's just going to be covered in leaves.

1730
02:20:49,591 --> 02:20:53,855
[SPEAKER_25]: But, it's fun to kick them and make lots of noise late at night.

1731
02:20:53,955 --> 02:20:57,238
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of funny, when I came here yesterday, there wasn't any leaves on the ground, really.

1732
02:20:57,318 --> 02:20:59,180
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I came in, and they were just all over the place.

1733
02:20:59,340 --> 02:21:00,321
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, they all fell at once.

1734
02:21:02,521 --> 02:21:04,243
[SPEAKER_25]: So that fucking sucks.

1735
02:21:04,523 --> 02:21:17,774
[SPEAKER_25]: Also, fuck you G4TV because you suck and your stupid attempt at doing something clever the Nintendo DS day was fucking lame, okay?

1736
02:21:18,295 --> 02:21:26,842
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't like watching TV in a small little screen on my TV showing the show and what looks like a DS around the show and some stupid chatting

1737
02:21:27,210 --> 02:21:28,992
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.

1738
02:21:45,811 --> 02:21:53,414
[SPEAKER_25]: Anyway, um, and finally, um, fuck you that my money isn't on my card yet.

1739
02:21:53,514 --> 02:21:57,595
[SPEAKER_25]: That pisses me off because I want to go spending, spending, spending, spending.

1740
02:21:58,275 --> 02:22:07,978
[SPEAKER_25]: And, uh, fuck you using my GameShark for breaking, especially after I spent like an hour putting all the codes in and playing with it a few days, and then all of a sudden it just stopped working.

1741
02:22:09,119 --> 02:22:10,219
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Interact.

1742
02:22:11,067 --> 02:22:11,327
[SPEAKER_25]: Old Face Jeff

1743
02:22:42,048 --> 02:22:42,909
[SPEAKER_24]: No, they get worse.

1744
02:22:43,809 --> 02:22:45,010
[SPEAKER_24]: F you to getting stood up.

1745
02:22:45,530 --> 02:22:46,330
[SPEAKER_24]: That is awful.

1746
02:22:46,571 --> 02:22:47,811
[SPEAKER_24]: Why do you do that to people?

1747
02:22:48,291 --> 02:22:49,212
[SPEAKER_24]: That is rude.

1748
02:22:49,632 --> 02:22:50,673
[SPEAKER_24]: It's so rude.

1749
02:22:51,833 --> 02:22:52,934
[SPEAKER_24]: God damn you.

1750
02:22:54,395 --> 02:22:54,755
[SPEAKER_24]: That's alright.

1751
02:22:55,115 --> 02:22:55,956
[SPEAKER_24]: I forgive, though.

1752
02:22:56,096 --> 02:22:56,776
[SPEAKER_24]: I forgave.

1753
02:22:57,216 --> 02:22:58,137
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm such a sucker.

1754
02:22:58,677 --> 02:22:59,398
[SPEAKER_24]: No, that's alright.

1755
02:22:59,798 --> 02:23:00,718
[SPEAKER_24]: I try to understand.

1756
02:23:00,738 --> 02:23:02,219
[SPEAKER_24]: I just have angst.

1757
02:23:02,579 --> 02:23:03,340
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes, Loki.

1758
02:23:04,781 --> 02:23:08,322
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, maybe watching a nice episode of I Killed Your Cat would help.

1759
02:23:09,883 --> 02:23:10,184
[SPEAKER_24]: Shut up.

1760
02:23:10,644 --> 02:23:10,964
[SPEAKER_24]: No, didn't...

1761
02:23:12,842 --> 02:23:14,103
[SPEAKER_07]: On a happier note, my paper's done.

1762
02:23:24,921 --> 02:23:30,983
[SPEAKER_24]: Also an F you to the fact that I have to wake up at 4 in the morning to catch a flight to LA so I can do one day's worth of work in LA.

1763
02:23:31,363 --> 02:23:43,228
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm training a whopping four people tomorrow and they're sending me all the way down there costing them I don't know how much money and the fact is I will be working from about 6 o'clock in the morning till 7 or 8 at night.

1764
02:23:43,308 --> 02:23:44,809
[SPEAKER_07]: That's because corporations are retarded.

[SPEAKER_03]: My God, the Pacers and the Pistons.

1789
02:25:53,190 --> 02:25:59,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Why the hell are you going to go fight over something just over a game just because someone dunked over your ass?

1790
02:26:01,184 --> 02:26:11,352
[SPEAKER_03]: And as for our test, why the fuck did you punch the wrong fan who you thought threw a bunch of cup of ice on you?

1791
02:26:12,133 --> 02:26:14,595
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the wrong person, you sucked a white man.

1792
02:26:17,137 --> 02:26:19,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead of some lady who was behind you, you actually threw it against you.

1793
02:26:22,041 --> 02:26:23,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, my gosh.

1794
02:26:24,423 --> 02:26:26,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, that also resolves.

[SPEAKER_03]: F you to the fans at the NBA, at that Detroit game, who are also causing the fight in the first place.

1796
02:26:35,039 --> 02:26:37,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, why can't we all get along?

1797
02:26:39,561 --> 02:26:40,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

[SPEAKER_03]: I think a few people got hospitalized over the fight.

1801
02:26:48,165 --> 02:26:49,686
[SPEAKER_03]: And people get suspended indefinitely.

1802
02:26:50,746 --> 02:26:52,027

1803
02:26:53,586 --> 02:26:57,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, it's the NBA's fault, or ooh, it's the Detroit Pistons' fault.

1804
02:26:57,408 --> 02:26:58,929
[SPEAKER_03]: It's everybody's fault in the first place.

1805
02:27:01,250 --> 02:27:01,890
[SPEAKER_16]: Seriously.

1806
02:27:02,931 --> 02:27:08,193
[SPEAKER_03]: People need to grow up, use their own common sense not to do some shit like that ever again.

1807
02:27:10,234 --> 02:27:16,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think, yeah, I think, well, so far they're suspended indefinitely, but most likely they're going to be suspended for the whole season.

1808
02:27:18,298 --> 02:27:19,399
[SPEAKER_03]: But who knows, I don't give a shit.

[SPEAKER_03]: And F you to trees for putting a goddamn tree branch under my car.

1810
02:27:29,192 --> 02:27:38,420
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to remove that by ripping the whole branch itself from the bottom.

1811
02:27:40,362 --> 02:27:46,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he's talking about more car problems and shit.

1812
02:27:46,167 --> 02:27:49,450
[SPEAKER_03]: And F you to more SUVs fucking up the road again.

1813
02:27:50,745 --> 02:28:11,218
[SPEAKER_03]: But this time I'm having a loose tire in the fucking freeway Almost causing another accident As if I have not gone through any more car problems recently Causing me to spend hundreds of dollars off my own damn paycheck And reporting it as an insurance will cost me a damn record There's also another F.E.

1816
02:28:22,624 --> 02:28:26,747

1817
02:28:30,110 --> 02:28:32,432
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, Explicit, you remind me of a...

02:28:33,739 --> 02:28:38,062
[SPEAKER_24]: 80 year old guy who's sitting out on the front lawn drunk as fuck yelling at himself.

02:28:45,566 --> 02:28:46,766

02:29:15,892 --> 02:29:17,212
[SPEAKER_24]: I think it would be a good FU music, though.

1835
02:29:18,653 --> 02:29:23,794
[SPEAKER_24]: MPQ says, a big FU to Washington State for not having any 2DX machines.

1836
02:29:26,614 --> 02:29:30,055
[SPEAKER_24]: Poto says, FU to greedy repo men who steal your Xbox.

1837

1839
02:30:02,276 --> 02:30:04,498
[SPEAKER_24]: I love it when you're not paying attention to this show.

1840
02:30:06,380 --> 02:30:07,581
[SPEAKER_07]: Like a yeast infection.

1841
02:30:13,147 --> 02:30:13,847
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeast is good.

1842
02:30:13,947 --> 02:30:14,808
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeast is in bread.

1843
02:30:14,848 --> 02:30:15,489
[SPEAKER_25]: I like bread.

1844
02:30:15,789 --> 02:30:16,430
[SPEAKER_25]: What's wrong there?

1845
02:30:17,654 --> 02:30:19,735
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not candida yeast.

1846
02:30:20,195 --> 02:30:25,897
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeast in bread is different than yeast in your vagina, okay?

1847
02:30:25,937 --> 02:30:32,980
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you know what happens when you get a candida yeast buildup in your organs, like your stomach and your intestines?

1848
02:30:33,260 --> 02:30:34,381
[SPEAKER_07]: It makes you die.

1849
02:30:34,401 --> 02:30:43,484
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it turns your stomach and your intestines into bread, and then you die, because they can't digest.

1850
02:30:43,564 --> 02:30:44,225
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

1851
02:30:45,345 --> 02:30:46,165

[SPEAKER_24]: Misty says, F me for falling asleep and missing part of the Ultramix 2 show.

1855
02:30:55,695 --> 02:30:56,455
[SPEAKER_24]: Aw, it's okay.

1856
02:30:57,756 --> 02:31:08,780
[SPEAKER_24]: Legend of Zaku says, F you to the fact that DDR Ultramix 2 got the better songs and DDR Extreme USA owners get in the shaft by Konami for favoring Microsoft with a dollar sign over Sony.

1857
02:31:09,320 --> 02:31:12,481
[SPEAKER_24]: F you to my braces for being retightened, thus making my teeth hurt.

[SPEAKER_24]: Sigurd says, F you to the lackluster DS launch.

1861
02:31:51,676 --> 02:31:52,377
[SPEAKER_24]: Hey, but you had G4.

1862
02:31:52,417 --> 02:31:53,919
[SPEAKER_24]: Just kidding.

1863
02:31:54,279 --> 02:31:55,541
[SPEAKER_24]: Where the hell is my WarioWare?

1864
02:31:56,302 --> 02:31:57,723
[SPEAKER_24]: That isn't Field of Magic.

1865
02:31:58,544 --> 02:32:03,089
[SPEAKER_24]: F you to homeless people because they were chasing me in my dream before turning into Orange Lounge Radio.

1866
02:32:03,170 --> 02:32:03,430
[SPEAKER_24]: What?

1867

[SPEAKER_24]: F you to DrawnTogether this past week for only being mildly funny.

1870
02:32:14,371 --> 02:32:15,651
[SPEAKER_24]: I agree, it was only mildly funny.

1871
02:32:15,931 --> 02:32:18,892
[SPEAKER_24]: More Xander and Foxy and Ling Ling and less everyone else.

1872
02:32:19,812 --> 02:32:27,974
[SPEAKER_24]: Final F you to people complaining about it taking too long to get G2 unlocked.

1873
02:32:28,074 --> 02:32:30,615
[SPEAKER_24]: I unlocked it in under a minute, so what's the problem?

1874
02:32:33,135 --> 02:32:35,596
[SPEAKER_24]: You know something they don't, you little jerk.

1875
02:32:35,676 --> 02:32:36,756
[SPEAKER_24]: You know it damn well.

1876

02:39:20,052 --> 02:39:20,612
[SPEAKER_24]: And you know what else?

1903
02:39:21,773 --> 02:39:25,676
[SPEAKER_24]: This is why the N-Gage never worked, because it didn't have PictoChat, honestly.

1904
02:39:26,297 --> 02:39:30,360
[SPEAKER_24]: Imagine if you could have PictoChat and send those little pictograms anywhere in the USA.

1905
02:39:30,941 --> 02:39:32,082
[SPEAKER_24]: Even to random phone numbers.

1906
02:39:33,763 --> 02:39:34,404
[SPEAKER_24]: That'd be the best.

1907
02:39:36,565 --> 02:39:37,766
[SPEAKER_10]: What does this cock?

1908
02:39:39,348 --> 02:39:41,269
[SPEAKER_16]: What does this cock on the cell phone?

1909
02:39:42,731 --> 02:39:44,212
[SPEAKER_10]: Why you call me a cock?

1910
02:39:44,312 --> 02:39:45,292
[SPEAKER_10]: I am no rooster.

1911
02:39:47,814 --> 02:39:48,114
[SPEAKER_24]: Love it.

1912
02:39:51,175 --> 02:39:53,096
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright, let's get to some Ask Orange Lounge.

1913
02:39:53,116 --> 02:39:56,178
[SPEAKER_24]: Remember, if you guys have a question, send it in over private message right now.

1914
02:39:56,238 --> 02:40:00,080
[SPEAKER_24]: Also, we'll open up the Skype line in a little bit if you guys want to call in and you have a comment or something.

1915
02:40:00,120 --> 02:40:00,880
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know, but here we go.

1916
02:40:08,184 --> 02:40:09,405
[SPEAKER_24]: Let's Ask Orange Lounge.

1917
02:40:09,986 --> 02:40:33,002
[SPEAKER_24]: some stupid question what will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio all I really know is that it's a really good thing that you guys can't see our picto chats cause then you'd think we're perverts as if you didn't already know extra verse tonight alright uh Flair O'Day

1918
02:40:34,740 --> 02:40:41,204
[SPEAKER_24]: Hey, isn't it a bit strange that they put a good chunk of the unlocks for Ultramix 2 on the V-Rare?

1919
02:40:41,444 --> 02:40:41,785
[SPEAKER_24]: And you know what?

1920
02:40:41,805 --> 02:40:45,887
[SPEAKER_24]: Come to think of it, a good half of the extreme V-Rare songs are unlocks too.

1921
02:40:46,508 --> 02:40:47,188
[SPEAKER_24]: What's up with that?

1922
02:40:48,029 --> 02:40:48,589
[SPEAKER_24]: I kind of agree.

1923
02:40:48,609 --> 02:40:52,732
[SPEAKER_24]: It kind of took a little bit of the thrill out of the unlocks, the fact that they were all already on the V-Rare.

1924
02:40:52,792 --> 02:40:56,774
[SPEAKER_24]: But at the same time, it was some of the best stuff on the mix, so I don't know.

1925
02:40:56,834 --> 02:41:02,258
[SPEAKER_24]: I would have liked to have seen more of the different drum songs, but I just thought the V-Rare was great because it had Skulk and Superstar.

1926
02:41:02,278 --> 02:41:02,898
[SPEAKER_24]: I thought that was neat.

1927
02:41:04,254 --> 02:41:06,836
[SPEAKER_24]: Any other comments, thoughts on the Ultimix 2 VRare?

1928
02:41:07,777 --> 02:41:08,777
[SPEAKER_10]: It was pretty good.

1929
02:41:09,378 --> 02:41:09,918
[SPEAKER_10]: I liked it.

1930
02:41:10,639 --> 02:41:13,121
[SPEAKER_24]: It was just weird that they put so many unlocks on it.

1931
02:41:13,561 --> 02:41:15,642
[SPEAKER_24]: You pretty much knew 9 of the unlocks, or was it 9 or 10?

1932
02:41:15,922 --> 02:41:16,223
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know.

1933
02:41:16,663 --> 02:41:17,043
[SPEAKER_24]: A lot.

1934
02:41:17,143 --> 02:41:21,406
[SPEAKER_24]: A whole lot of the unlocks just by picking yourself up a copy of the VRare.

1935
02:41:21,426 --> 02:41:25,990
[SPEAKER_24]: Which, by the way, I'm trying to snag us some extra copies so that we can give them away on the show.

1936
02:41:26,977 --> 02:41:36,099
[SPEAKER_24]: So even after the Kiryamaoka giveaway is done, we'll do hopefully another giveaway, some Ultramix 2 VRares, maybe for much easier things, just like calling in at a certain time or something.

1937
02:41:36,119 --> 02:41:36,499
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll see.

1938
02:41:36,599 --> 02:41:36,879
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll see.

1939
02:41:37,079 --> 02:41:37,360
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know.

1940
02:41:38,920 --> 02:41:40,180
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright, moving on.

1941
02:41:40,240 --> 02:41:42,361
[SPEAKER_24]: Let's see what Dark Knight has to say.

1942
02:41:42,441 --> 02:41:42,741
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

1943
02:41:43,281 --> 02:41:46,102
[SPEAKER_24]: If a tree falls in the woods, does it make a sound?

1944
02:41:46,802 --> 02:41:47,322
[SPEAKER_24]: No, just kidding.

1945
02:41:47,362 --> 02:41:52,603
[SPEAKER_24]: The real question is, how much of a lifespan will the DS have before Nintendo decides to make a new handheld?

1946
02:41:54,564 --> 02:41:55,044
[SPEAKER_24]: Any thoughts on this?

1947
02:41:55,064 --> 02:41:55,264
[SPEAKER_24]: Loki.

1948
02:41:55,990 --> 02:41:58,161
[SPEAKER_24]: But I do half-hell deeming another color.

1949
02:42:01,360 --> 02:42:02,981
[SPEAKER_24]: Seriously, I give it February.

1950
02:42:03,101 --> 02:42:04,923
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll have new DS colors, honestly.

1951
02:42:05,023 --> 02:42:25,758
[SPEAKER_24]: And then there will be some kind of Super DS or like DS Extreme or something where you're going to have to re-buy the DS because they did the same damn thing with the Game Boy when they did the little... They're going to do DS NES colors and DS Famicom colors and... I mean, they had Game Boy and then they had Game Boy Pocket.

1952
02:42:26,038 --> 02:42:27,279
[SPEAKER_24]: Then they had Game Boy Color.

1953
02:42:27,359 --> 02:42:30,162
[SPEAKER_24]: Then they had all the fucking colored Game Boy colors.

1954
02:42:31,262 --> 02:42:33,544
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to be as much crap as the PSP will be.

1955
02:42:54,285 --> 02:42:55,947
[SPEAKER_24]: Siegert in our chatroom says, People!

1956
02:42:56,588 --> 02:43:01,073
[SPEAKER_24]: There are no color combinations that will work besides the silver and black.

1957
02:43:01,413 --> 02:43:02,654
[SPEAKER_24]: I have thought about this for hours.

1958
02:43:05,638 --> 02:43:06,038
[SPEAKER_24]: Get a life.

1959
02:43:08,721 --> 02:43:09,542
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, the QS.

1960
02:43:09,562 --> 02:43:10,443
[SPEAKER_25]: Quad screen.

1961
02:43:10,483 --> 02:43:11,464
[SPEAKER_25]: Quad screen.

1962
02:43:13,191 --> 02:43:17,054
[SPEAKER_25]: Let's see how many screens we can cram into this thing.

1963
02:43:17,134 --> 02:43:17,554
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know.

1964
02:43:18,635 --> 02:43:25,580
[SPEAKER_25]: To be honest, I think the next thing you're going to hear about DS is going to be a Bluetooth network where you can actually play online internet games.

1965
02:43:26,420 --> 02:43:28,041
[SPEAKER_11]: And it'll be a peripheral, though.

1966
02:43:28,982 --> 02:43:29,682
[SPEAKER_25]: It's coming out.

1967
02:43:30,003 --> 02:43:31,264
[SPEAKER_25]: Warp Pipe is working on it.

1968
02:43:31,784 --> 02:43:34,406
[SPEAKER_25]: They're not saying that's what they're working on, but that's what they're working on.

1969
02:43:35,226 --> 02:43:38,809
[SPEAKER_25]: So you'll see that at E3 this year, though, because they're going to be at E3 this year.

1970
02:43:40,470 --> 02:43:41,871
[SPEAKER_25]: But not until then.

1971
02:43:44,015 --> 02:43:44,135
[SPEAKER_24]: DJ Doe

1972
02:43:48,615 --> 02:43:51,336
[SPEAKER_24]: How did you get the music from Ultramix on the Orange Lounge Radio?

1973
02:43:51,376 --> 02:43:55,038
[SPEAKER_24]: The reason I'm asking is because I like to make a music CD out of the songs from Ultramix.

1974
02:43:56,098 --> 02:43:56,738
[SPEAKER_24]: Very carefully.

1975
02:43:56,818 --> 02:43:58,879
[SPEAKER_24]: No, we rip them ourselves, actually.

1976
02:43:58,899 --> 02:44:01,160
[SPEAKER_24]: We have the soundboard hooked up through the Xbox.

1977
02:44:01,180 --> 02:44:02,281
[SPEAKER_24]: That's how we got tonight's songs.

1978
02:44:02,641 --> 02:44:07,383
[SPEAKER_24]: And I know they're not like 100% perfect quality, so honestly, you may not want to burn them to CD.

1979
02:44:08,223 --> 02:44:12,605
[SPEAKER_24]: But honestly, just keep looking around there on some of the different forums out there on the net.

1980
02:44:12,805 --> 02:44:14,085
[SPEAKER_24]: Something will turn up soon enough.

1981
02:44:14,325 --> 02:44:14,826
[SPEAKER_24]: Always does.

1982
02:44:15,146 --> 02:44:15,786
[SPEAKER_24]: Any advice, Loki?

1983
02:44:16,326 --> 02:44:18,287
[SPEAKER_25]: DDRUK, once the sim files are out.

1984
02:44:18,996 --> 02:44:23,139
[SPEAKER_24]: Why are DDR Extreme USA owners getting the shaft now that Ultramix 2 came out and got the better of the songs?

1985
02:44:39,750 --> 02:44:44,273
[SPEAKER_24]: I think they just tried to do something different with Extreme, with the whole eye toy thing.

1986
02:44:44,313 --> 02:44:50,157
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, you could argue, well, you know, Xbox doesn't have hands and feet mode, and I know that makes a lot of you guys go, big fucking deal.

1987
02:44:50,737 --> 02:44:56,321
[SPEAKER_24]: But, they tried to do something different with the PlayStation, just like they were doing different things with Ultramix 2.

1988
02:44:56,401 --> 02:45:00,824
[SPEAKER_24]: So I don't want to knock the PlayStation 2 for at least trying something different that wasn't there before.

1989
02:45:00,844 --> 02:45:04,426
[SPEAKER_24]: And it wasn't just the eye toy things, but, you know, some new interface, new songs, things like that.

1990
02:45:05,607 --> 02:45:06,348
[SPEAKER_24]: It just, you know...

1991
02:45:07,268 --> 02:45:07,388
[SPEAKER_24]: Buy.

1992
02:45:07,428 --> 02:45:07,608
[SPEAKER_24]: Purchase.

1993
02:45:37,028 --> 02:45:39,733
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you for watching!

1994
02:45:52,138 --> 02:45:56,120
[SPEAKER_24]: And then, how many crappy songs can you find in Extreme USA versus how many can you find in Ultramix 2?

1995
02:45:56,200 --> 02:45:57,101
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, I don't know.

1996
02:45:57,161 --> 02:46:00,483
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, I believe, if I'm not mistaking, it's kind of... I don't know.

1997
02:46:01,323 --> 02:46:06,265
[SPEAKER_24]: Everybody thinks they know, but I think Japan, for the most part, did Extreme.

1998
02:46:06,706 --> 02:46:12,689
[SPEAKER_24]: And Hawaii, well, we know Hawaii pretty much, for the most part, did Ultramix 2 with some help from their staff in the Bay.

1999
02:46:13,609 --> 02:46:14,750
[SPEAKER_24]: So, I don't know.

2000
02:46:15,270 --> 02:46:16,051
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know, anyway.

2001
02:46:17,611 --> 02:46:18,152
[SPEAKER_24]: It's just different.

2002
02:46:18,172 --> 02:46:20,653
[SPEAKER_24]: They tried something different, and for some folks it didn't work.

2003
02:46:21,690 --> 02:46:22,751
[SPEAKER_24]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2004
02:46:52,523 --> 02:46:53,564
[SPEAKER_24]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2005
02:47:09,993 --> 02:47:13,415
[SPEAKER_24]: For the most part, people are taking very well to the new music, and hopefully it'll continue.

2006
02:47:14,216 --> 02:47:23,542
[SPEAKER_24]: MPQ wants to know, which is better, paying $400 for a Japanese PlayStation 2, 2DX and controller, or driving 14 hours to Ventura, California to play 2DX?

2007
02:47:25,163 --> 02:47:28,305
[SPEAKER_24]: I've done both, sadly enough, although my drive was only 8 hours.

2008
02:47:29,325 --> 02:47:29,625
[SPEAKER_24]: But...

2009
02:47:31,317 --> 02:47:31,797
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know.

2010
02:47:36,380 --> 02:47:36,780
[SPEAKER_24]: You know what?

2011
02:47:36,921 --> 02:47:43,685
[SPEAKER_24]: Even when you get it at home, it doesn't quite compare to the arcade, especially because the consumer releases are a little bit behind the arcade releases.

2012
02:47:44,145 --> 02:47:50,309
[SPEAKER_24]: So honestly, I wish I could tell you one or the other was better, but face it, you're going to end up doing both, just like I did.

2013
02:47:51,970 --> 02:47:53,731
[SPEAKER_25]: It's like masturbation and sex.

2014
02:47:57,762 --> 02:48:11,892
[SPEAKER_24]: D.D.Arcoholic says, Hi Rob, Jamie, and Matt.

2015
02:48:11,932 --> 02:48:12,253
[SPEAKER_24]: Hi.

2016
02:48:13,333 --> 02:48:16,075
[SPEAKER_24]: I just thought of a super idea and wondered what you thought.

2017
02:48:16,976 --> 02:48:22,320
[SPEAKER_24]: Would you do an all night Orange Lounge Radio Marathon live show like on a Saturday night?

2018
02:48:22,360 --> 02:48:23,901
[SPEAKER_24]: You could do it for charity even.

2019
02:48:25,125 --> 02:48:25,725
[SPEAKER_07]: That'd be fun.

2020
02:48:26,285 --> 02:48:26,565
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

2021
02:48:26,865 --> 02:48:28,366
[SPEAKER_07]: It'd be like a slumber party with vodka.

2022
02:48:28,846 --> 02:48:30,166
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, with one condition.

2023
02:48:30,946 --> 02:48:32,587
[SPEAKER_24]: I want an arcade to host it.

2024
02:48:33,427 --> 02:48:36,367
[SPEAKER_24]: If we're going to do it overnight, I'm not going to do it in this little apartment.

2025
02:48:36,427 --> 02:48:38,268
[SPEAKER_24]: I want arcade games and things to do.

2026
02:48:38,728 --> 02:48:45,529
[SPEAKER_24]: So if we could get an arcade in the Sacramento area to agree to it, and I think if we work the charity angle, yes, I'm all down for it.

2027
02:48:45,789 --> 02:48:46,269
[SPEAKER_24]: Absolutely.

2028
02:48:46,689 --> 02:48:47,409
[SPEAKER_24]: I think it could be fun.

2029
02:48:47,569 --> 02:48:50,750
[SPEAKER_24]: Or maybe we could talk to our buddy at the theater.

2030
02:48:51,684 --> 02:48:52,124
[SPEAKER_23]: Possibly.

2031
02:48:52,164 --> 02:48:52,985
[SPEAKER_24]: That might be an idea.

2032
02:48:53,165 --> 02:48:54,325
[SPEAKER_23]: On the big screen.

2033
02:48:54,565 --> 02:48:54,885
[SPEAKER_24]: Uh-huh.

2034
02:48:55,286 --> 02:48:55,806
[SPEAKER_24]: That's an idea.

2035
02:48:56,166 --> 02:48:57,246
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll have to think about that one.

2036
02:48:58,007 --> 02:49:01,128
[SPEAKER_25]: Can you imagine if we could get PictoChat on that giant screen?

2037
02:49:01,668 --> 02:49:03,009
[SPEAKER_25]: That would be so cool.

2038
02:49:04,610 --> 02:49:04,870
[SPEAKER_24]: Sorry.

2039
02:49:05,910 --> 02:49:07,351
[SPEAKER_24]: The Orange Lounge lock-in.

2040
02:49:07,511 --> 02:49:08,411
[SPEAKER_24]: I like the idea.

2041
02:49:08,611 --> 02:49:11,073
[SPEAKER_24]: I like the charity angle, especially with Christmas coming up.

2042
02:49:11,093 --> 02:49:12,033
[SPEAKER_24]: The Asylum.

2043
02:49:12,053 --> 02:49:12,233
What?

2044
02:49:12,433 --> 02:49:13,093
[SPEAKER_25]: The Asylum.

2045
02:49:13,133 --> 02:49:14,274
[SPEAKER_25]: We lock you in.

2046
02:49:15,319 --> 02:49:15,679
[SPEAKER_24]: Great.

2047
02:49:16,079 --> 02:49:18,281
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, I'm like, the Asylum is a dance club.

2048
02:49:18,321 --> 02:49:18,961
[SPEAKER_24]: Don't get it confused.

2049
02:49:21,183 --> 02:49:22,323
[SPEAKER_24]: I really do like that idea.

2050
02:49:22,583 --> 02:49:26,986
[SPEAKER_24]: And in fact, I want to get in touch with you later about that, DDArcoholic, because maybe you can help me approach some arcades about it.

2051
02:49:27,747 --> 02:49:29,128
[SPEAKER_24]: See if anybody would be willing to do it.

2052
02:49:29,148 --> 02:49:30,348
[SPEAKER_24]: I think it would be fun.

2053
02:49:30,648 --> 02:49:34,331
[SPEAKER_24]: If not, we could just always bring our shit to Country Club Lanes, because they're open 24 hours anyway.

2054
02:49:35,311 --> 02:49:36,172
[SPEAKER_24]: But I'm all down for it.

2055
02:49:36,192 --> 02:49:36,792
[SPEAKER_24]: I think it would be fun.

2056
02:49:38,573 --> 02:49:38,813
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright.

2057
02:49:40,174 --> 02:49:43,136
[SPEAKER_24]: Misty says, What do you guys want for Christmas?

2058
02:49:43,356 --> 02:49:44,277
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, I'm so glad she's asking.

2059
02:49:44,955 --> 02:49:45,235
[SPEAKER_07]: Money.

2060
02:49:45,615 --> 02:49:47,056
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots of it.

2061
02:49:47,717 --> 02:49:49,518
[SPEAKER_07]: And some spinach.

2062
02:49:52,099 --> 02:49:54,961
[SPEAKER_23]: I want sex.

2063
02:49:57,322 --> 02:49:58,283
[SPEAKER_23]: But not from Santa.

2064
02:49:58,303 --> 02:50:03,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Santa's got years of experience.

2065
02:50:03,726 --> 02:50:04,226
[SPEAKER_24]: That's alright.

2066
02:50:05,326 --> 02:50:07,508
[SPEAKER_24]: Santa would be quite the sugar daddy if you think about it.

2067
02:50:08,028 --> 02:50:09,789
[SPEAKER_06]: I want someone to pay for my plane ticket home.

2068
02:50:10,509 --> 02:50:11,910
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

2069
02:50:27,606 --> 02:50:29,669
[SPEAKER_24]: And I know some friends of mine are going to host them, so that's cool.

2070
02:50:29,709 --> 02:50:30,210
[SPEAKER_24]: It works out.

2071
02:50:30,610 --> 02:50:32,393
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm not really big on material things.

2072
02:50:32,733 --> 02:50:35,617
[SPEAKER_24]: Pretty much like if I want something bad enough, I just go and get it.

2073
02:50:36,358 --> 02:50:40,744
[SPEAKER_24]: Honestly, I think the best gifts I've gotten in the past were like things that people made.

2074
02:50:40,824 --> 02:50:43,889
[SPEAKER_24]: Like one year, Shark Scroll made me this collage for my birthday.

2075
02:50:44,269 --> 02:50:45,290
[SPEAKER_24]: Look at you a sugar mama.

2076
02:51:19,217 --> 02:51:34,268
[SPEAKER_24]: DJ Ranma S, DS says, My question, will you and the rest of Orange Lounge Radio be suicidal enough to go shopping on Black Friday, which is, of course, the day after Thanksgiving, biggest shopping day of the year?

2077
02:51:34,368 --> 02:51:35,528
[SPEAKER_24]: Any plans to go shopping?

2078
02:51:35,569 --> 02:51:35,829
[SPEAKER_24]: Jamie?

2079
02:51:37,670 --> 02:51:39,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, yeah, actually, I am.

2080
02:51:39,371 --> 02:51:40,572
[SPEAKER_24]: But you're going to be in Alabama then, right?

2081
02:51:40,992 --> 02:51:42,674
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I'm still going to be doing some shopping.

2082
02:51:42,694 --> 02:51:43,254
[SPEAKER_24]: Still pretty crazy.

2083
02:51:43,294 --> 02:51:44,535
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, no, that's that Friday.

2084
02:51:44,575 --> 02:51:45,636
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm actually going to be in Dothan.

2085
02:51:47,230 --> 02:51:50,412
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh my god, that's where my boss is from.

2086
02:51:51,373 --> 02:51:51,933
[SPEAKER_24]: That's so funny.

2087
02:51:53,394 --> 02:51:54,355
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll go bomb them for you.

2088
02:51:55,536 --> 02:51:56,517
[SPEAKER_24]: No, not my boss's house.

2089
02:51:56,537 --> 02:51:57,157
[SPEAKER_24]: What Loki said.

2090
02:51:57,197 --> 02:51:57,858
[SPEAKER_24]: I love my boss.

2091
02:51:58,498 --> 02:51:58,778
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright.

2092
02:52:00,059 --> 02:52:00,479
[SPEAKER_24]: Interesting.

2093
02:52:00,900 --> 02:52:03,762
[SPEAKER_24]: As far as shopping, no, I don't plan on going to the mall that day.

2094
02:52:03,822 --> 02:52:06,043
[SPEAKER_24]: There's nothing that exciting about it for me.

2095
02:52:06,143 --> 02:52:07,605
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm going to stay home and masturbate all day.

2096
02:52:07,705 --> 02:52:08,105
[SPEAKER_24]: No, I'm kidding.

2097
02:52:08,145 --> 02:52:10,266
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know what I'm going to do.

2098
02:52:10,447 --> 02:52:11,367
[SPEAKER_25]: I may make it out.

2099
02:52:11,527 --> 02:52:13,349
[SPEAKER_25]: If I have stuff to buy, I don't know.

2100
02:52:13,369 --> 02:52:15,150
[SPEAKER_25]: I have to think of what I want to buy.

2101
02:52:15,791 --> 02:52:18,514
[SPEAKER_25]: Depends if I have my money by then, which I hopefully will.

2102
02:52:18,995 --> 02:52:21,277
[SPEAKER_25]: So, yeah.

2103
02:52:22,959 --> 02:52:26,082
[SPEAKER_24]: I just want to sleep and play Final Fantasy and Ultramix, too.

2104
02:52:26,142 --> 02:52:26,863
[SPEAKER_24]: Is that so wrong?

2105
02:52:26,983 --> 02:52:28,164
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, I don't want to go shopping.

2106
02:52:28,625 --> 02:52:29,546
[SPEAKER_24]: I want to stay home.

2107
02:52:30,707 --> 02:52:32,089
[SPEAKER_24]: Maybe get Mongolian barbecue.

2108
02:52:32,109 --> 02:52:33,470
[SPEAKER_24]: Mmm, Mongolian.

2109
02:52:35,632 --> 02:52:40,177
[SPEAKER_24]: Legend of Zaku says, so what do you think might be on your Thanksgiving Day table, a.k.a.

2110
02:52:40,297 --> 02:52:42,439
[SPEAKER_24]: unique side dishes out of the norm?

2111
02:52:43,580 --> 02:52:45,923
[SPEAKER_24]: Jamie, what do you think might be a unique dish on your table?

2112
02:52:47,224 --> 02:52:47,624
[SPEAKER_07]: Haggis.

2113
02:52:47,644 --> 02:52:51,629
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that for real?

2114
02:52:52,149 --> 02:52:52,630
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, for real.

2115
02:52:53,390 --> 02:52:54,451
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no idea.

2116
02:52:56,874 --> 02:52:58,816
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't really have many out of the ordinary things.

2117
02:53:00,433 --> 02:53:05,576
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really know who's going to be cooking Thanksgiving dinner when I'm there, so I'm just going to say, put food in front of me.

2118
02:53:05,876 --> 02:53:06,636
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm off the diet today.

2119
02:53:06,716 --> 02:53:07,036
[SPEAKER_07]: Feed me.

2120
02:53:08,397 --> 02:53:10,958
[SPEAKER_24]: And remember, don't eat in DDR.

2121
02:53:11,599 --> 02:53:17,102
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, but I should take a minute to plug the special that our buddies over on DDR Freak Radio are doing on Thanksgiving.

2122
02:53:17,122 --> 02:53:22,825
[SPEAKER_24]: They're doing like an all-day marathon of DDR, like back-to-back, like non-stop till your brain explodes.

2123
02:53:22,865 --> 02:53:24,385
[SPEAKER_24]: Seriously, it's going to be cool.

2124
02:53:24,425 --> 02:53:24,726
[SPEAKER_24]: Like what?

2125
02:53:25,106 --> 02:53:27,467
[SPEAKER_24]: Second mix, third mix, fourth mix, all of it back-to-back.

2126
02:53:27,487 --> 02:53:28,467
[SPEAKER_24]: What time are they starting over there?

2127
02:53:28,487 --> 02:53:29,148
[SPEAKER_24]: Nine, ten o'clock?

2128
02:53:29,790 --> 02:53:57,164
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know, check ddrfreak.com Go to ddrfreak, yeah Yeah, I mean, like you don't go there anyway But, you know, I just wanted to get that plug out there Don't forget Alright, let's see Moving on Oh, my dish at my table I don't eat turkey, I hate turkey So Thanksgiving's a really shitty holiday for me But my mom says she will be cooking ham And I like ham And she actually says she might just be ready to say fuck it And order a pizza, which I've been telling her to do for years So we might do that That would rock Deep fried turkey

2129
02:53:58,308 --> 02:54:00,869
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously, it doesn't take too long to clean because they're really yummy.

2130
02:54:00,989 --> 02:54:01,529
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't like turkey.

2131
02:54:03,911 --> 02:54:06,872
[SPEAKER_24]: DarkTetsuya said, have any of you picked up Metal Gear Solid 3 yet?

2132
02:54:07,052 --> 02:54:08,413
[SPEAKER_24]: If so, what do you think so far?

2133
02:54:08,473 --> 02:54:14,775
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, DarkTetsuya, if you were listening on Thursday, you would know that we got Metal Gear Solid 3, but haven't really played it yet.

2134
02:54:15,016 --> 02:54:16,676
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got it, and we haven't played it yet.

2135
02:54:17,457 --> 02:54:17,677
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh?

2136
02:54:17,797 --> 02:54:21,138
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got it, and we haven't played it yet because they've been playing Halo.

2137
02:54:21,799 --> 02:54:24,640
[SPEAKER_24]: Sadly enough, I've been playing more Rumble Roses than Metal Gear Solid 3.

2138
02:54:26,041 --> 02:54:29,102
[SPEAKER_24]: Rumble Roses is every cheesy thing you would want it to be.

2139
02:54:30,302 --> 02:54:34,543
[SPEAKER_24]: It is so horrifically bad in a great way.

2140
02:54:36,704 --> 02:54:37,404
[SPEAKER_24]: Last question.

2141
02:54:39,524 --> 02:54:43,726
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, not really a question, but a comment from DDArchaholic says, Sounds good.

2142
02:54:44,146 --> 02:54:45,366
[SPEAKER_24]: I'll make calls and stuff.

2143
02:54:46,394 --> 02:54:47,035
[SPEAKER_24]: Good, good deal.

2144
02:54:47,815 --> 02:54:51,819
[SPEAKER_24]: Maybe we'll open up the Skype line for like one quick call if anybody wants to get in there.

2145
02:54:51,859 --> 02:54:52,139
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know.

2146
02:54:52,159 --> 02:54:54,001
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll open it up and see if anybody wants to call.

2147
02:54:54,741 --> 02:54:56,943
[SPEAKER_24]: A lot of good questions.

2148
02:54:57,784 --> 02:55:01,247
[SPEAKER_24]: Next week on the show, don't forget that MidiHead is going to be interviewed.

2149
02:55:01,287 --> 02:55:02,868
[SPEAKER_24]: That's something we're really looking forward to.

2150
02:55:02,928 --> 02:55:04,029
[SPEAKER_24]: It's going to be good to talk to him.

2151
02:55:04,350 --> 02:55:06,812
[SPEAKER_24]: I want to know if he's remixed anything else.

2152
02:55:06,832 --> 02:55:07,512
[SPEAKER_24]: That's what I want to know.

2153
02:55:07,873 --> 02:55:09,874
[SPEAKER_24]: Because that In My Eyes remix is damn good.

2154
02:55:10,295 --> 02:55:11,516
[SPEAKER_24]: So I want to know if there's anything else there.

2155
02:55:11,923 --> 02:55:14,845
[SPEAKER_24]: You can visit his site over at midihead.com, of course.

2156
02:55:15,425 --> 02:55:18,928
[SPEAKER_24]: And hopefully we get more people in the future as well.

2157
02:55:19,068 --> 02:55:20,088
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright, Siggy's calling back.

2158
02:55:20,108 --> 02:55:21,349
[SPEAKER_24]: I think he has a question or comment.

2159
02:55:21,369 --> 02:55:22,090
[SPEAKER_24]: Hey, Siggy, what's up?

2160
02:55:22,730 --> 02:55:23,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, what's up?

2161
02:55:23,210 --> 02:55:26,593
[SPEAKER_04]: I've forgotten one more thing you mentioned about 2DX8 style.

2162
02:55:26,853 --> 02:55:27,133
[SPEAKER_24]: Do it.

2163
02:55:27,813 --> 02:55:30,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's an option called Random Plus.

2164
02:55:32,216 --> 02:55:33,417
[SPEAKER_24]: Random Plus, and what does that do?

2165
02:55:34,138 --> 02:55:40,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's the same thing as Random, only you do it... Scratch is included in it.

2166
02:55:41,866 --> 02:55:42,527
[SPEAKER_23]: Interesting.

2167
02:55:43,327 --> 02:55:43,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh.

2168
02:55:44,368 --> 02:55:56,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and the way you access Random Plus is hold the key wherever the random is for at least a few seconds, and the random will turn red.

2169
02:55:57,238 --> 02:55:57,558
[SPEAKER_11]: Huh.

2170
02:55:58,139 --> 02:55:58,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2171
02:55:58,459 --> 02:56:00,821
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's how you access Random Plus.

2172
02:56:01,241 --> 02:56:05,785
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, supposedly you have to do something before that, but they'll do that, but I don't know.

2173
02:56:06,513 --> 02:56:07,634
[SPEAKER_24]: So maybe it's an unlock, we'll see.

2174
02:56:07,914 --> 02:56:10,436
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright, I'm going to go and take another call real fast, Siggy, but thanks for calling.

2175
02:56:10,816 --> 02:56:11,056
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

2176
02:56:11,136 --> 02:56:11,517
[SPEAKER_24]: Have a good one.

2177
02:56:12,157 --> 02:56:14,358
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright, let's take another... Oh, damn it, just missed it.

2178
02:56:15,139 --> 02:56:18,021
[SPEAKER_24]: That was you that just called... Oh, maybe I hung up on him.

2179
02:56:19,582 --> 02:56:22,564
[SPEAKER_24]: Call back, person that just tried to call, because I think I hung up on him.

2180
02:56:22,624 --> 02:56:23,005
[SPEAKER_24]: There we go.

2181
02:56:23,865 --> 02:56:24,966
[SPEAKER_24]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2182
02:56:25,786 --> 02:56:26,947
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi, it's MPQ.

2183
02:56:27,047 --> 02:56:28,428
[SPEAKER_24]: Hello, MPQ, what's on your mind?

2184
02:56:29,649 --> 02:56:33,632
[SPEAKER_18]: I was just wondering if I have any right to complain about 2DX when I have...

2185
02:56:34,289 --> 02:56:36,451
[SPEAKER_18]: A poppin' music machine within driving distance.

2186
02:56:37,052 --> 02:56:38,994
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, I don't know, what do you guys think?

2187
02:56:39,014 --> 02:56:41,036
[SPEAKER_24]: Does he have a right to complain about two things?

2188
02:56:41,236 --> 02:56:42,717
[SPEAKER_24]: What mix of poppin' music is it?

2189
02:56:43,358 --> 02:56:43,718
[SPEAKER_24]: Five.

2190
02:56:44,739 --> 02:56:46,060
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, see, now five's kinda old.

2191
02:56:46,281 --> 02:56:47,262
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, it's good, but it's old.

2192
02:56:47,822 --> 02:56:48,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you can complain.

2193
02:56:49,384 --> 02:56:53,588
[SPEAKER_24]: I'd say you still have a right to complain, but not as much as the rest of us, okay?

2194
02:56:53,608 --> 02:56:54,008
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

2195
02:56:54,529 --> 02:56:54,929
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright.

2196
02:56:55,009 --> 02:56:55,329
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright.

2197
02:56:56,130 --> 02:56:56,591
[SPEAKER_24]: Have a good one.

2198
02:56:57,732 --> 02:56:57,972
[SPEAKER_24]: Bye.

2199
02:56:58,573 --> 02:56:58,833
Bye.

2200
02:56:59,978 --> 02:57:01,139
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright, we gotta wrap up the show.

2201
02:57:01,239 --> 02:57:07,144
[SPEAKER_24]: Sorry to keep these calls quick, but we do need to wrap things up, and that means we gotta go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

2202
02:57:07,625 --> 02:57:08,606
[SPEAKER_24]: Arcadian, your final thought.

2203
02:57:11,088 --> 02:57:12,529
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, yay, Horde weekend coming up.

2204
02:57:14,030 --> 02:57:14,551
[SPEAKER_06]: I hear that.

2205
02:57:16,973 --> 02:57:18,934
[SPEAKER_24]: Uh, Explicit, your final thought.

2206
02:57:21,597 --> 02:57:22,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, Thanksgiving.

2207
02:57:24,399 --> 02:57:25,300
[SPEAKER_23]: Good turkey.

2208
02:57:26,221 --> 02:57:26,361
[SPEAKER_23]: Uh...

2209
02:57:29,010 --> 02:57:30,091
[SPEAKER_25]: Uh, Loki, your final thought.

2210
02:57:33,533 --> 02:57:34,914
[SPEAKER_25]: I know there's codes out there.

2211
02:57:35,014 --> 02:57:40,578
[SPEAKER_25]: I've seen them before for Grand Theft Auto San Andreas where you can modify the damage that each gun does.

2212
02:57:41,058 --> 02:57:44,180
[SPEAKER_25]: And I can't find them for the life of me, and that pisses me off.

2213
02:57:45,961 --> 02:57:51,225
[SPEAKER_25]: That and, um... Yeah, I need to buy some more games for the DST.

2214
02:57:53,590 --> 02:57:58,335
[SPEAKER_24]: My final thought is... I don't want to get up and fly tomorrow.

2215
02:57:58,415 --> 02:57:58,896
[SPEAKER_24]: It sucks.

2216
02:57:59,717 --> 02:58:02,420
[SPEAKER_24]: And you know, I left my email with all my travel information at work.

2217
02:58:03,461 --> 02:58:04,762
[SPEAKER_24]: But I know what flight I'm on and everything.

2218
02:58:04,782 --> 02:58:05,743
[SPEAKER_24]: So hopefully I don't have a problem.

2219
02:58:05,863 --> 02:58:06,504
[SPEAKER_24]: Or else I'm screwed.

2220
02:58:06,764 --> 02:58:07,085
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll see.

2221
02:58:07,425 --> 02:58:08,126
[SPEAKER_24]: Jamie, your final thought.

2222
02:58:09,227 --> 02:58:11,329
[SPEAKER_07]: My final thought is... God damn you people.

2223
02:58:11,450 --> 02:58:13,572
[SPEAKER_07]: Sign up for stuff and give me my iPod.

2224
02:58:14,617 --> 02:58:16,498
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh God, you didn't get suckered into that too, did you?

2225
02:58:16,558 --> 02:58:19,940
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, no, it's just because it's an experiment, so I want help.

2226
02:58:20,280 --> 02:58:20,520
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

2227
02:58:20,540 --> 02:58:21,381
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll help me, won't you, Rob?

2228
02:58:21,501 --> 02:58:21,641
[SPEAKER_24]: No.

2229
02:58:22,682 --> 02:58:23,922
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't buy into that shit.

2230
02:58:24,503 --> 02:58:25,643
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to get my mom to sign up.

2231
02:58:26,884 --> 02:58:27,384
[SPEAKER_24]: Have fun.

2232
02:58:27,765 --> 02:58:32,387
[SPEAKER_07]: But no, it's more of an, I don't really care, it's just more of an experiment just to see.

2233
02:58:33,108 --> 02:58:37,030
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I found that if you do the blockbuster thing, you can cancel it before they charge you with anything.

2234
02:58:37,250 --> 02:58:38,070
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, yeah, you can.

2235
02:58:38,491 --> 02:58:38,871
[SPEAKER_07]: So, uh.

2236
02:58:39,802 --> 02:58:41,364
[SPEAKER_07]: I decided it's fun.

2237
02:58:41,504 --> 02:58:42,244
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a distraction.

2238
02:58:42,865 --> 02:58:43,425
[SPEAKER_07]: So why not?

2239
02:58:43,766 --> 02:58:44,066
[SPEAKER_24]: Why not?

2240
02:58:44,566 --> 02:58:46,308
[SPEAKER_24]: I just don't want spam.

2241
02:58:46,328 --> 02:58:48,189
[SPEAKER_07]: So looking forward to going to Alabama.

2242
02:58:48,209 --> 02:58:49,411
[SPEAKER_07]: This one doesn't give you any spam mail.

2243
02:58:51,092 --> 02:58:51,432
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll see.

2244
02:58:51,452 --> 02:58:52,853
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm looking forward to going to Alabama.

2245
02:58:53,134 --> 02:58:54,275
[SPEAKER_07]: Getting the hell out of this state.

2246
02:58:55,656 --> 02:58:56,416
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, gee, thank you.

2247
02:58:57,017 --> 02:58:57,638
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll miss you too.

2248
02:58:57,658 --> 02:58:58,899
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not meaning the people.

2249
02:58:58,959 --> 02:59:01,501
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm meaning the other people that don't exist in my universe.

2250
02:59:01,843 --> 02:59:02,304
[SPEAKER_24]: That's fine.

2251
02:59:04,286 --> 02:59:05,086
[SPEAKER_24]: I guess that's it.

2252
02:59:05,467 --> 02:59:08,169
[SPEAKER_24]: Tune in next week for more fun on the show.

2253
02:59:08,330 --> 02:59:12,153
[SPEAKER_24]: And hopefully, what I'm kind of hoping is that maybe we can get Karaoke Revolution 3 next week.

2254
02:59:12,214 --> 02:59:15,096
[SPEAKER_24]: Because you know when Jamie leaves, Matt has to sing.

2255
02:59:16,278 --> 02:59:16,978
[SPEAKER_24]: It's tradition.

2256
02:59:17,659 --> 02:59:17,879
[SPEAKER_24]: PICTOCHAT

2257
02:59:44,145 --> 02:59:49,027
[SPEAKER_21]: That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

2258
02:59:49,848 --> 02:59:54,049

2262
03:00:43,997 --> 03:01:02,610
[SPEAKER_01]: It holds me so tight, like handcuffs at night Walkin' round in women's underwear In the office there's a guy named Melvin He pretends that I am Murphy Brown He'll say, are you ready?

2263
03:01:02,630 --> 03:01:08,574

2267
03:02:29,588 --> 03:02:31,389
[SPEAKER_24]: Jamie, why the Christmas songs already?

2268
03:02:32,270 --> 03:02:39,094
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I figured if our major department stores can do it and Walgreens can, so can I. Oh my god, are they playing Christmas songs at Walgreens already?

2269
03:02:40,095 --> 03:02:41,736
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got the Christmas stuff up.

2270
03:02:42,903 --> 03:02:50,906
[SPEAKER_07]: I went to Walmart the other day because we went to buy a silly headgear and stuff.

2271
03:02:51,606 --> 03:02:52,286
[SPEAKER_07]: A headgear?

2272
03:02:52,706 --> 03:02:52,906
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh?

2273
03:02:53,487 --> 03:02:55,667
[SPEAKER_07]: We bought Care Bears party hats this year.

2274
03:02:56,808 --> 03:02:59,829
[SPEAKER_07]: But they already had a whole Christmas section open.

2275
03:03:00,789 --> 03:03:01,729
[SPEAKER_07]: It was kind of stupid.

2276
03:03:04,610 --> 03:03:04,910
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh well.

2277
03:03:06,071 --> 03:03:08,731
[SPEAKER_24]: And to answer the question in the chatroom, yes, that was from the Bob and Tom show, right?

2278
03:03:09,972 --> 03:03:10,492
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, indeed.

2279
03:03:11,823 --> 03:03:15,645
[SPEAKER_24]: Ryachan says, it's funny to go into Walmart and walk around in the women's section looking for stuff.

2280
03:03:15,705 --> 03:03:18,966
[SPEAKER_24]: My mom and my dad just start singing, walk around in women's underwear.

2281
03:03:19,826 --> 03:03:20,086
[SPEAKER_24]: Get it?

2282
03:03:20,106 --> 03:03:21,147
[SPEAKER_24]: Because you're in the department.

2283
03:03:25,589 --> 03:03:26,209
[SPEAKER_24]: I thought it was funny.

2284
03:03:27,209 --> 03:03:27,790
[SPEAKER_07]: It is funny.

2285
03:03:31,171 --> 03:03:34,312
[SPEAKER_24]: So when do you go on your great adventure, DarkSakura?

2286
03:03:35,313 --> 03:03:37,353
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm flying out Wednesday at 2.45.

2287
03:03:37,434 --> 03:03:38,654
[SPEAKER_07]: Who wants to drive me to the airport?

2288
03:03:40,135 --> 03:03:40,935
[SPEAKER_24]: I would, but I'm working.

2289
03:03:42,970 --> 03:03:44,539
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm still trying to find a way to the airport.

2290
03:03:45,271 --> 03:03:45,731
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, shoot.

2291
03:03:45,791 --> 03:03:47,992
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, you could always do a shuttle?

2292
03:03:48,112 --> 03:03:48,512
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know.

2293
03:03:49,213 --> 03:03:50,133
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm working it out, don't worry.

2294
03:03:50,333 --> 03:03:50,893
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, that's good.

2295
03:03:52,074 --> 03:03:58,437
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright, I guess we'll just kind of keep it a short afterbirth tonight then, since a lot of you guys don't have anything else to say.

2296
03:03:59,217 --> 03:04:06,220
[SPEAKER_24]: But, I know we didn't get to a lot of those Ultramix 2 MP3s, so I'm going to put in the rest right now so you guys can hear it.

2297
03:04:06,880 --> 03:04:10,322
[SPEAKER_24]: Because I bet you guys, some of you guys were waiting to hear some of the rest of those songs.

2298
03:04:10,822 --> 03:04:11,962
[SPEAKER_24]: So we will get to those right now.

2299
03:04:11,982 --> 03:04:13,503
[SPEAKER_24]: We're going to start it with Jam On It.

2300
03:04:14,216 --> 03:04:22,858
[SPEAKER_24]: and La Cucaracha, Life is a Game, Looking for You, Mellow, Monkey Punk, Play My Game, and Red Room.

2301
03:04:23,158 --> 03:04:25,139
[SPEAKER_24]: All those songs you're going to hear right now.

2302
03:04:26,979 --> 03:04:28,820
[SPEAKER_24]: It's a block of Ultramix 2 music.

2303
03:04:28,860 --> 03:04:29,380
[SPEAKER_24]: Enjoy, you guys.

2304
03:04:32,600 --> 03:04:33,421
[SPEAKER_24]: I have to set it up here.

2305
03:04:33,461 --> 03:04:33,701
[SPEAKER_24]: Sorry.

2306
03:04:34,521 --> 03:04:35,281
[SPEAKER_24]: Here we go.

2307
03:04:35,361 --> 03:04:35,921
[SPEAKER_24]: Now we can do it.

2308
03:04:41,463 --> 03:04:42,243
[SPEAKER_16]: Can't hear me.

2309
03:04:50,607 --> 03:05:17,988
[SPEAKER_19]: I jam on it, I jam on it, jam on and on and on and on it And if you're feeling like you wanna dance on that then go on ahead and float it Cause jamming on is what we do best, it's what separates us from the rest And if you don't think who's there for real, let me tell you what happened to the man at sea Say Superman had come to town to see who he could rock He blew away every crew he faced until he reached our block

2310
03:05:19,109 --> 03:05:22,471
[SPEAKER_16]: It's because we're three stories high, but one was made of steel.

2311
03:05:23,031 --> 03:05:26,573
[SPEAKER_16]: And when we brought our dead outside, he said, I'm so real.

2312
03:05:26,933 --> 03:05:28,914
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, Superman looked up at me.

2313
03:05:29,154 --> 03:05:30,995
[SPEAKER_19]: He said, you rock so naturally.

2314
03:05:31,295 --> 03:05:35,296
[SPEAKER_19]: I said, now that you've learned a deal, let me tell you why I'm so real.

2315
03:05:35,457 --> 03:05:37,377
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm Cosmo D from outer space.

2316
03:05:37,397 --> 03:05:39,278
[SPEAKER_19]: I can do rock for human race.

2317
03:05:39,318 --> 03:05:41,599
[SPEAKER_19]: I do it right because I can't do it wrong.

2318
03:05:41,619 --> 03:05:43,120
[SPEAKER_19]: That's why the whole world is singing this song.
