595174	601623	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio episode number 120 in progress and our friends over at Step Squad
602179	603540	Sending us that little shout out there.
603560	605182	Yay, Step Squad!
605202	606743	That shout out's about two years old.
606783	607564	We need to get a new one.
607644	610326	We need to get a new Step Squad family gathering.
610946	612748	And what is Step Squad for those not in the know?
612768	614549	Because I know you're a member of Step Squad.
614710	621936	Step Squad, it actually isn't really technically a DDR team per se, but it is at the same time.
622316	628681	It's more of a friends that were brought together by things like the Mani and Anime.
628741	630323	It just has a very DDR tone.
630803	634645	So it's not one of those, like, teams, oh my god, it's LOL, gonna kick your butt, let's have a battle.
634665	647530	Yeah, yeah, no, it's not all about, oh my god, we have to win over you, no, it's, you know, of course we take pride in our wins, but it's not all DDR to us, it's more about family than anything.
647850	648711	Very cool, very cool.
649011	652513	Well, welcome everybody to Orange Lounge Radio for those joining us for the very first time.
652553	653454	Welcome to the program.
654034	659458	We are a program dedicated to all things Bomani and then some for those of you that don't know what Bomani is.
659538	662680	That is the music gaming fusion series put out by Konami.
663001	668184	So, of course, we talk a lot about other types of video games and other types of music and any randomness that we feel like.
668284	675669	So I know we got some new folks listening tonight, especially with the syndications happening over on DDR Freak Radio, which Iguana Girl's been helping out with on Friday nights.
675869	676270	Yay!
676750	677531	I appreciate that.
677951	679813	6 o'clock over on DDR Freak Radio on Friday nights.
680154	681555	And I know we're getting some new people from that.
681635	685059	So thanks a lot, you guys, for tuning in and helping to support Orange Lounge Radio.
685139	686060	So I hope you enjoy the program.
686661	687962	Because we're a little weird sometimes.
688402	688703	Hello?
688943	689644	A little weird.
690224	690485	Anyway.
691121	692161	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
716528	717429	I am the Jamie.
717889	719690	Does she know that you're sitting in her chair?
719810	720531	No, not at all.
721151	723913	And burping out... And burping in her honor.
724918	726399	Aguana Girl, how was your week?
749411	754255	No, mine, I still haven't taken it in, because I thought I figured out what the problem was.
776779	778060	I don't know what it is.
778160	782923	Whenever I coast, it makes a very loud growling noise.
783003	785724	Like my car is angry that I'm driving it or something.
785904	795490	Yeah, mine started whenever... It's like if I'm going low speeds, anything like 20 miles per hour or below, and then I proceed to brake, it's starting to squeal.
795750	797271	But if it's raining, it won't squeal.
798551	800352	Yeah, I don't know what the hell is wrong with mine.
800392	802053	I'm thinking about taking it in, but...
803268	803969	Ford Fix or Repair Daily
833208	834048	Yeah, but they're cheap.
834589	835889	And that's the whole concept.
836649	840111	You buy a cheap car, you get a shoddy car, but it'll last a few years.
840571	841911	And you've made this comparison before.
841931	845293	It's like talking about the Mad Catz dance pads for DDR.
845313	849114	The $20 dance pads versus the $100 Ignition 2.0.
849694	850054	Exactly.
850595	854216	If you're going to pay for an Ignition 2.0, you're going to get the quality of that.
854256	856777	It's going to last a long time, but you're going to pay out the ass for it.
857634	863716	But if you're going to pay for the Mad Catz pad, you have to understand there's going to be some problems with it eventually.
864156	868678	Had Speedy Oil Change not killed my car, I wouldn't have this problem now, would I?
868698	874700	Yeah, so that's kind of frustrating, and that's how I spent my day, was being frustrating.
875061	875721	Oh, that's not fun.
876501	878322	Well, take out your frustrations on our listeners.
878802	880583	Yeah.
880783	881603	Damn you all.
881803	883164	Damn you all to hell.
885959	886319	All right.
886439	887940	Anything else you want to share about your week?
889080	889220	No.
889680	889881	Okay.
890141	890841	How was Thanksgiving?
891941	893582	I talked about that, but you weren't listening.
894002	895343	Well, I... Okay, never mind.
895363	896763	I said I had to do the two-family thing.
896783	898964	We went to Ross's family's house, and then we went to my family's house.
898984	901725	I was looking for... I was prying to get that other story you were telling me.
902125	902845	Oh, okay.
902925	903626	See?
903666	905306	I was doing that prying thing.
905346	906547	Prying, okay.
906587	911189	That hosts do when they know that there's a topic that needs to be talked about, but they don't want to say that there's one.
911289	911889	Yeah, so...
913001	919346	What we did is we decided to bring all of our odd music games with us.
919386	926812	So we brought our Taiko Drum Master and Donkey Konga and Karaoke Revolution 1, 2, and 3.
927692	930334	And we took them all over to my parents' house.
931515	937880	And I'm guessing my mom had a little bit too much wine to drink because she was just having way too much fun on everything.
938981	940462	And my mom...
941352	943213	I noticed it runs in the family couldn't resist
959998	968760	So she tried to play Taiko Drum Master and she got like a 58% on some one-star easy song and just absolutely biffed it.
968780	971661	So my brother-in-law, who's a drummer, had to show her up.
972821	983904	And then after he did that, my blind father took over the drum, asked us to put it on a song, and proceeded to outplay my mother.
985492	986012	Thank you for watching!
1003239	1009341	And at one point he stopped randomly, but we got him to start back up again.
1009381	1017564	And if he hadn't stopped and gotten off of his little groove that he was in, he probably would have passed the song, which is extremely scary.
1018744	1019725	But he ended up getting like a 48%.
1020885	1023166	He didn't beat my mom, but came within 10%.
1023626	1026887	So I can now say that my blind father can play Taiko Drum Master.
1027347	1027687	Very nice.
1027868	1030330	You know, I think this was a topic once in DDR Chit Chat.
1030670	1032132	How do you play DDR when you're blind?
1032772	1033253	You don't!
1034634	1036055	You just kind of stomp on all the arrows.
1036175	1040039	You just kind of dance in the rhythm, and you'd be surprised at what you can do.
1040059	1043262	I actually haven't ever had my dad play DDR, but maybe I should.
1044443	1045124	That might be funny.
1046705	1047166	I don't know.
1047786	1049668	I'm thinking he would be good with Donkey Kong, too.
1050269	1050769	Oh, very cool.
1050809	1051130	Yeah.
1051170	1051490	Very cool.
1052331	1052651	All right.
1053683	1054143	That's about it.
1054263	1055184	Alright, we're going to move on.
1055224	1056244	Let's talk to DDR Angel.
1056284	1056645	How was your week?
1056665	1057065	How was your day?
1057285	1058906	How does a blind person play DDR?
1058986	1060667	Oh boy, what did I just walk into?
1061707	1064409	Same crap you've been walking into for the past, what, year and a half?
1064609	1065189	Almost two.
1065269	1066150	Yeah, exactly.
1067971	1068811	Not much going on.
1068851	1082479	I mean, had two days of school this week, and that was pretty good because I really needed the break, just like I'm sure Jess did and all that.
1083992	1094898	Um, after school was over, just, you know, spent the last four days playing games that I haven't been able to play, and I got my DS!
1095579	1096880	Yay!
1098921	1107966	So, um, yeah, that took six stores to find, and it was not good until I walked away with it, and it was all good, so...
1109093	1112154	Best Buy is not your friend unless you call all the stores in Sacramento.
1112254	1112534	Anyway!
1113215	1114995	I got my DS at Best Buy, what's your problem?
1116116	1117496	I had to call six stores.
1117756	1118657	That was not cool.
1120237	1121698	Or however many stores you've got, four?
1123479	1125099	Yeah, so I got my DS and it's all good.
1125540	1129001	And the minigames on Mario 64 are your friend.
1130441	1132462	Minigames on Mario 64 DS rock.
1132622	1134183	They make that game worth it, they really do.
1135305	1139268	You can just spend all your time playing the minigames rather than playing the actual game.
1140189	1141550	Favorite minigame so far?
1141890	1143351	The Bob-omb Slingshot game.
1144092	1144632	I love that one.
1144652	1149176	My other favorite one is the He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not, or They Love Me.
1149276	1150437	It's gender neutral, isn't it?
1150477	1152678	Loves Me, Loves Me Not, that's it.
1153419	1154079	Koyoshi.
1155961	1157522	It's so lame, yet so fun.
1158863	1161625	We should get back on that Blind DDR topic later.
1161645	1163327	I have a reason for that.
1164007	1164828	Okay, maybe we will.
1165436	1165756	Okay!
1166097	1166537	Alright!
1166597	1166897	Cool!
1166978	1167338	Alright!
1167398	1167738	Yeah!
1168018	1168999	Islander, how was your week?
1169019	1169560	How was your day?
1170361	1171181	Um, I was fine.
1171201	1174164	Um, pretty much Jessica's already summed it up.
1174184	1178488	For those of you who don't know, that Iwona Girl and I are a couple.
1178748	1179109	Duh.
1180070	1181331	Oh my god, it's a DDR couple.
1182412	1182852	We are?
1182872	1189178	I thought you were just, like, sleeping in my bed for no fair reason.
1189398	1189498	Oh.
1192379	1193680	This is a TMI alert.
1197343	1198824	I thought you were just my sex slave.
1198864	1199404	I don't know.
1200265	1201566	Hey, hey, hey.
1203367	1204688	The TMI SWAT team's here.
1206369	1221500	But no, just spent the days off playing games that we bought because we kind of went crazy and bought a shitload of games including Taiko, Donkey Konga,
1222818	1224179	Oh shit, KR3.
1225980	1228002	You guys went on quite a little spending spree, didn't you?
1228242	1228982	Yeah.
1229022	1230183	We went a little crazy.
1231123	1232184	But we've been good.
1232604	1234626	A little crazy, Rumble Roses.
1235546	1237547	We've lost almost 80 pounds, we earned it.
1239248	1244972	But yeah, just when I'm playing all these games that I'm like, holy crap, I have like new stuff to play now.
1246513	1248074	So, just been doing a lot of that lately.
1248234	1249755	Very cool.
1250415	1251396	Anything else you want to share about your
1252044	1253465	Um, let's see.
1254386	1257668	Other than watching her blind father play Tycho.
1260930	1263732	Trying to think what else was pretty remarkable this weekend.
1266654	1267915	No, I think she pretty much covered everything.
1268535	1269276	Alright, fair enough then.
1270296	1271677	Loki, my friend, how was your week?
1271717	1272258	How was your day?
1274419	1275460	Well, um...
1276710	1278270	My week was okay, because it was short.
1279571	1280591	Work-wise, it was short.
1281351	1284152	We had a potluck on Wednesday, and I had lots of food.
1285072	1287153	Didn't really do anything, so that's cool.
1288313	1293034	Played Final Fantasy most of the week, and then... What else?
1293114	1295315	Oh, just more DS crap.
1295855	1301177	Have like 41 stars now in Mario 64, and that game's frustrating as hell.
1301537	1301617	And...
1302997	1304938	Then I also bought two new games.
1304998	1310760	I bought Alien Hominid and Under the Skin, and those are strange.
1310801	1318064	I love Alien Hominid, though, because it reminds me of a hand-drawn version of Metal Slug, and it's pretty cool.
1318684	1321085	And then, what else did I do?
1321265	1328468	Oh yeah, I had to get a new cheat device thing, so I bought the Code Breaker and stuff.
1328548	1330429	I think that was last week that I did that, but...
1331178	1331938	Grand Theft Auto 3
1363140	1368685	I don't know why I bought this game, and...
1385245	1389587	And I think that there were powers that be that coerced me into doing so against my will.
1390427	1393189	In other words, his girlfriend said, buy it or I'm not putting out.
1397411	1400912	Which, by the way, is very interesting when you consider his girlfriend is not a gamer at all.
1401593	1401893	At all.
1403413	1406355	But yet, she loves Mario 64 DS and she loves this game.
1407735	1408996	But I love her, so I forgive her.
1413160	1415363	She just likes to watch my suffering.
1415984	1416825	She likes to watch?
1418567	1419708	She likes to participate.
1420970	1421651	No, I don't know.
1422072	1422472	Whatever.
1424014	1424174	No.
1425716	1426297	Alright, I'm done.
1427873	1429875	Well, my week and my day.
1429895	1431978	I've got to make this quick because I've got to get to a break pretty soon here.
1432018	1433239	But my week and my day was pretty cool.
1433299	1435502	I went out to Roseville Golf Land one night.
1435722	1436663	I know, gasp.
1436864	1438866	Which is the first time in months I've been there.
1438886	1440548	And I know we're an international show here.
1440588	1445554	So for those of you guys who don't know what Roseville Golf Land is, it's where Bomani games go to die, basically, and get disrepair.
1446234	1448556	But they have a brand new game called Derby Owners Club.
1448696	1450117	We went out twice this weekend.
1450217	1452159	And you've heard me talk about this game on the show before.
1452199	1454821	You've heard Jamie talk about this game zillions of times on the show before.
1454861	1455482	She loves this game.
1455922	1456603	I love this game too.
1456623	1457503	I made a brand new horse.
1457543	1459365	I called her Britney Spears so I could whip her.
1460185	1465169	And I was so proud of Britney because she came in second in my first race.
1465189	1465950	So I was very proud.
1466210	1470554	But where did these people come from at Golf Land who know how to play Derby Owners Club all of a sudden?
1470874	1471274	It's crazy.
1471294	1472135	All of them come from UCD.
1474357	1476119	I've seen a lot of UCD up there.
1495199	1495739	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
1514241	1516483	Do you know how that feels to be on your last step?
1516523	1519525	And before you can hit your last step, kaboom, failed.
1519905	1528172	Okay, if it makes you feel better, I probably couldn't even pass anything past a seven-footer at this point.
1528772	1532055	That's how long it's been since I've played either.
1532175	1537719	And yet I am the head administrator of the largest DDR site in the world.
1538560	1539100	What the hell?
1539261	1539621	I don't know.
1542172	1543073	I don't get it myself.
1543153	1544094	It's the love of the game, though.
1544374	1552560	I mean, honestly, I could suck at DDR, but when games like Ultramix 2 come out, I get in fanboy mode all over again, no matter if I suck at the game and I'm getting old or what.
1553240	1555061	But anyway, speaking of Ultramix 2, we've got to cut it short.
1555081	1560445	We've got to go to a break, because when we come back from the break, Midihead from Ultramix 2 is going to be here on the program.
1560685	1561466	Very excited about that.
1561626	1565469	So I want you guys to familiarize yourselves a little bit with Midihead, in case you forgot.
1565489	1569712	I don't know how you could, because it's one of the most kick-ass remixes we've had in a DDR game in a long time.
1570310	1581735	Remix of one of our favorite artists, Akira Yamaoka, took his song, made it just, I can't say made it better, but certainly not made it worse, just made it different and cool, is what he did.
1581815	1583616	And it's In My Eyes, the Midi Head mix.
1584016	1586297	Check it out, and when we come back, Midi Head will be on the program.
1586337	1586757	We'll be back.
1709013	1711354	It is I. It is I. Hello, welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.
1738700	1739121	Greetings.
1739441	1740302	Hey, how you doing?
1741764	1743146	You know, I'm doing great.
1743166	1745449	I'm just lounging around in my shorts.
1746470	1747191	I see.
1747772	1754340	Being as we're in Southern California, and it's actually kind of nippy outside, but
1754784	1757065	Here in my studio, it's nice and toasty.
1757245	1758605	It's been pretty cold up here, too.
1758645	1761026	We're based out of Sacramento, so we're not that far away.
1761046	1762126	We're just a stone's throw away.
1763026	1764387	It's not cold up there.
1764767	1766888	It's been freezing up here these past few days.
1766928	1767708	Don't you guys think so?
1768148	1776030	In the 40s, during... Have you guys ever been to New York City or Park City or any of those towns this time of year?
1776910	1782012	Not this time of year, but I went there during the summer, and that was bad enough at night, this one night, so...
1783455	1785056	You don't know cold, my friend!
1786097	1787378	That's why we live here.
1787999	1789160	Exactly, that's why we live here.
1789200	1791122	We've been there, and that's why we live in California.
1791542	1792043	That's right.
1793364	1798389	But, you know, the folks that created Ultramix 2, they're over in Hawaii, so they've got to be loving it year-round there.
1799189	1807417	Yeah, they're getting the tropical moisture, so their skin's all nice and young-looking.
1807665	1810466	Except for the occasional tropical storm and things like that.
1811147	1812727	Yeah, who cares?
1812847	1814408	It's worth living in Hawaii for that.
1815208	1815769	Absolutely.
1815829	1817870	I would live there any old day of the week.
1818790	1824453	Speaking of Hawaii, I'm kind of curious, Middy, how did you become involved with those guys and getting into DDR Ultimix 2?
1826133	1835938	Well, actually, I called them on the phone one day and I bribed them and said I would give them my wife and children if they let me do the remix for them.
1837867	1838147	Really?
1838227	1840948	So what will your wife and child be doing at Konami now?
1843249	1843849	Okay.
1844810	1849352	Now they're going to hear this and go, you sold us.
1849432	1865258	So really what happened is I got contacted by my label, A Different Drum, and there was a bulletin that went out to all of the artists on the label who said, hey,
1866961	1878083	Konami wants to do this remix and they also want track submissions for the Ultramix 2 game and anybody who's interested can hear the details.
1878123	1894107	So basically I just got the tracks, the original tracks from Konami and it was kind of a free-for-all so I just did one and just kind of submitted it not really thinking that it was going to go anywhere
1895587	1907934	and next thing I know I get a call from Jaron Tolman, who's one of their head sound designers down there, and he said, hey, Konami liked it so much they want you to do an extended remix.
1908495	1912157	Ah, which is the one we see on the V-Rare, that super long mix, right?
1912677	1913537	Super long!
1913557	1914438	Super long!
1914458	1917980	Yeah, so that's how I got involved.
1919309	1920270	Very cool, very cool.
1920390	1924314	And there's lots of great music from a different drum, including Ultramix 2.
1924634	1939409	And I gotta tell you, I don't know how much of the scene you've kind of been watching and kind of the reaction from the DDR fans, but a lot of folks have been really into Ultramix 2 and they kind of credit a lot of the success of the game because of the song list and because of a lot of the music that comes from a different drum.
1939709	1941051	Fans such as Echo Image...
1941411	1944913	Day Behavior, and all those folks, and yourself, all coming over from a different drum.
1945113	1945673	It's been great.
1945733	1947534	It's been a great, I think, collaboration.
1947574	1949535	I hope you guys work together more in the future.
1950215	1962060	Yeah, you know, I know that Konami's let the door open, so they've really liked what's come out of a different drum, and myself included.
1963601	1965282	So, what they...
1966731	1976299	What they're grateful for is the fact they're not dealing with these prima donnas on these larger labels.
1977860	1983865	They have all these demands and we just want to get our music out there and get it to the fans.
1984684	1989165	Honestly, I would dance to Skulk, Close Your Eyes, The In My Eyes remix.
1989205	1994786	I would dance to that long before I danced to Britney on DDR.
1994806	1999807	You say that now, but if Britney was now standing in front of you with... Yeah, that's a good point.
2000427	2001448	Britney, I'm your biggest fan.
2001828	2002608	Come on, I know.
2004208	2007349	She'd be dancing to Britney all night if she was sitting right there in your recliner.
2009797	2010277	I got a point.
2010517	2017763	I got to ask, since we're kind of talking about DDR here, did you know about DDR before you became involved with the project?
2017783	2018663	Did you ever play it?
2018703	2019724	I mean, you mentioned you had a kid.
2020064	2024007	I got to tell you guys, this is going to piss off some of your listeners.
2024248	2024808	That's all right.
2024828	2028010	We piss them off enough.
2028331	2037858	You know, I used to be extremely into video games and found them to, it was kind of,
2038208	2056239	I won't say it's a waste of time, but for me, it was like getting in the way of producing albums, and basically, since I have a family, I have to be a responsible adult now, so I kind of got out of the whole video game thing.
2056279	2059861	I used to be heavily into, do you guys remember Descent?
2061062	2063344	Oh yeah, I used to play that, yeah.
2065230	2077363	and then, you know, most recently I was heavily into the Quake 3 add-on mod, Urban Terror.
2078044	2078785	Oh, okay.
2079085	2080046	Man after my own heart.
2080887	2083950	That is by far the best game I've played to date.
2084110	2084210	Now...
2085467	2087087	I've never played BDR, though, guys.
2087127	2087647	I'm sorry.
2087968	2088568	That's all right.
2088608	2089028	That's all right.
2089188	2094709	You were talking some stuff to me before the show that I totally wasn't getting either, so now we're even, okay?
2094989	2096949	We're even.
2097089	2103391	But, you know, you sound like the kind of guy, though, that if you were still playing video games, you would be playing Halo 2 with the rest of us right now, I think.
2104091	2108232	Yeah, I would be playing until my usual 4 or 5 o'clock in the morning.
2108292	2111952	And you would be getting your ass kicked by 13-year-olds, just like the rest of us do.
2112052	2112592	Exactly.
2112632	2114793	You know, what's funny is I actually had a...
2115652	2123780	I had a 13-year-old show me some moves on Urban Terror one night late when we had the whole entire board to ourselves while everybody else went to bed.
2126142	2126823	It was kind of funny.
2127804	2133950	I'm 33 and this little 13-year-old is showing me stuff that I would have never figured out on my own.
2134338	2134718	Wow.
2135779	2136780	The kids these days.
2137740	2138481	The kids these days?
2138561	2139922	I feel so old saying that myself.
2139942	2144405	Where is our youth going?
2145086	2151730	Midyette, I wanted to ask you about the song that you specifically remixed, In My Eyes, a track originally done by Akira Yamaoka.
2152431	2158555	You kind of mentioned that you had a lot of the original Konami tracks, so was it your choice to remix that particular song?
2159676	2161037	Yeah, you know, I think...
2164344	2176793	Out of the two songs that I was given, that one kind of stuck out the most because the chord progression, I knew right away what to do with it when I heard it.
2178315	2188222	I pretty much took out all of his musical elements, left the vocals, and just redid everything from the ground up.
2188723	2199626	Yeah, you can tell that, like, a lot of... It's not just, you know, you took a song and added a new beat to it, but you just totally kind of deconstructed it and then built it from the ground up, and I think that's part of what's so great about it.
2200226	2200526	Yeah.
2200546	2201186	Awesome.
2201206	2201626	Thank you.
2202167	2203247	No problem, no problem, anytime.
2204047	2206588	Have you gotten a chance to talk to Akira about the remix at all?
2206628	2208308	I don't know if you got a chance to meet him.
2208328	2211009	Yeah, you know, he and I talk every day, and he calls me...
2212219	2215880	Well, you know, we got to talk to him one time, and unfortunately we didn't get him on air.
2215920	2219061	We got to talk to him one time, and I tell you, we were just giddy little fanboys.
2219141	2219901	It was just amazing.
2219981	2222841	I don't know if you've ever played... No, actually, I haven't spoke to him.
2222881	2225822	I have no idea how he feels about the remix whatsoever.
2226802	2227222	No clue.
2227322	2228003	We should find out.
2228023	2229103	We have ways of finding out.
2229743	2234024	For all I know, he thinks, you know, this is garbage.
2234988	2236529	What has he done to my song?
2236689	2237549	I don't know.
2237589	2238710	No, I'm sure he loves it.
2238750	2242471	Trust me, there's been some remixes in DDR in the past that were absolute garbage.
2242951	2244392	Yours is not garbage.
2244472	2245472	Don't worry about it.
2245532	2246473	Thank you.
2247013	2248213	My head is swelling now.
2248754	2249454	It's huge.
2249714	2249954	You're right.
2249994	2250915	I need to stop.
2251755	2254416	What kind of equipment do you use to do these remixes in your studio?
2255768	2262353	Actually, I'm a big fan of... See, this will all go over your head.
2262553	2263894	We're back to the over your head thing.
2264034	2264675	All right, that's fine.
2264835	2266716	Maybe some of our listeners will catch up on it.
2266836	2267136	Okay.
2268117	2272140	So, I actually use acid, and I'm not talking about white blotter.
2272960	2277083	Okay, now, my co-host Loki is very familiar with acid.
2277103	2278464	He does his own remixing in acid.
2278504	2279485	So, that I know.
2279505	2280425	I'm with you so far.
2280445	2281226	All right, cool, cool.
2281666	2283107	Well, you know, a lot of people have...
2284915	2285416	Thanks for watching!
2297492	2299013	Really cool stuff.
2299113	2301614	I mean, I've been using it since the program first came out.
2301834	2305515	I want to point out, I'm sorry, I hate to cut you off, but I've got to say this.
2305595	2322142	I've got to say this, because there's been these amateur remix contests that have happened throughout the Bomani scene that go on on such big websites, and they want to get people to remix stuff, and they always say, don't use Acid, because we want a program that is, we want something that doesn't sound like two songs meshed together.
2322502	2326264	I would just like to point out, the pros have just said that they use Acid.
2327549	2329731	So STFU, guys, STFU.
2331853	2341081	Yeah, it's a great program, especially now in version 5, but I use Acid in conjunction with, you know, I do a lot of the elements live, so I don't sequence much.
2341181	2347246	I actually just hit the record button, and we'll just play the sequence live.
2347747	2351991	If it's an arpeggiated piece, you know, that of course is sequenced, but...
2354085	2358786	Most of it goes live into acid, then I just chop it up and dice it up and move stuff around.
2358806	2360766	It's just a lot faster that way.
2360786	2366787	And I use virtual instruments in addition to my Axis Virus KC.
2366847	2380429	I have all the Spectrasonics Stylus RMX, Atmosphere Trilogy, and of course, I've got software from Vanguard.
2380469	2381730	I use Vanguard and Zeta.
2382870	2383010	And...
2384947	2385947	I love SoftSense.
2387388	2388088	Very cool.
2388168	2389529	Now see, Loki's following you here.
2389569	2390609	Maybe that's just... Alright.
2391689	2395991	See, well, I mean, you know, basically the stuff I do is very, very, very amateur.
2396031	2401193	I mean, I'm not even going as far as calling them actual remixes, more of just white label remixes and stuff.
2401513	2406474	Because, you know, I don't really have the talent at the moment to be actually creating my own stuff.
2406494	2410796	So basically it's a lot of loop chopping and adding in a little bit of elements that way, but
2411257	2412198	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2441867	2442687	Yes, I guess.
2444569	2444849	All right.
2445890	2448933	You were mentioning that there was kind of two songs that you were sent.
2449433	2454338	Were there actually other songs that you remixed for DDR that didn't make it onto Ultramix 2?
2454958	2456240	Now, come on now.
2456300	2459322	Would I have remixed a song that wouldn't have made it on DDR?
2460083	2466469	Well, maybe I'm thinking maybe you're one of those artists that construct something and then you go, no, it's crap, it's crap, and you throw it out.
2466489	2467169	No, no, no, no, no.
2468436	2469676	No, man, I've been doing this since 1989.
2469836	2474618	I mean, you know, that whole phase has been definitely worked out of me.
2475298	2479519	But, no, actually, this was the one song I remixed.
2480139	2484340	It was kind of a stab in the dark, and I threw it out there, and lo and behold.
2485660	2486721	Very cool, very cool.
2487381	2490842	And you mentioned that you might be doing this again for another Konami project.
2490882	2494182	Do you see yourself being involved with a future Konami game?
2494823	2496203	Oh, sure, yeah, definitely.
2496844	2501486	Nothing specific at the moment, but like I said earlier, the door's open.
2502147	2505368	We've been in talks about keeping in touch and doing more.
2506209	2509951	They've been really happy with this last remix.
2510051	2511251	It's not just the remix.
2511271	2514053	You have to look at the actual business side, too.
2514193	2520316	If you're easy to deal with as an artist, this is just tips going out there to people trying to get their foot in the door.
2521156	2524278	It's not just the quality of the work that you do.
2524438	2524558	It's
2525111	2528253	It's also your attitude and your business dealings with these guys.
2528593	2540100	If you're a professional from start to finish and you're very proficient and attentive, a lot of people make great music but can't get work.
2540780	2544262	It's because they don't have the relationship thing down.
2544322	2548565	You've got to be able to have a good working relationship with these guys.
2549205	2550226	I absolutely agree.
2550266	2553327	That's why I am all about kissing ass on this program.
2553507	2554028	Now, carefully.
2555003	2556587	Did you get the chocolates I sent you?
2556687	2557068	Middy Head.
2559194	2560136	What?
2560156	2561519	Did you get the chocolates we sent?
2562236	2591308	yeah exactly I have a brown nose too now if the folks that are listening go on over to your website over at www.mittyhead.com and I hope that they do because it's a great website you notice that there's a lot of other stuff that you've worked with before you did some TV gigs you did some movie things in the past before but what I want to know have you worked with video game music ever before was this the first thing
2592006	2593766	No, I've never worked with video game music before.
2594647	2601168	I moved out here to Los Angeles to try some things.
2601648	2609290	The first stuff I did was for Fox Television's Dark Angel.
2609770	2621373	When that happened, I started landing tracks through my publisher in a lot of different television shows and then was able to get one landed in the Matrix Reloaded movie trailer
2622046	2623747	Just prior to the film's release.
2625188	2627489	So that had been most of my experience.
2627849	2632032	And I'd looked into video games several times going, you know, I should do that.
2632072	2632832	I should get into that.
2633412	2634713	I had no idea how.
2635754	2637114	I had friends that were doing it.
2637494	2639576	And I asked them how I'd get involved.
2639596	2646039	And they said, you know, it's a nightmare trying to get in there because so many people are trying to do it.
2646880	2651222	So I just never really pursued it because I always had other things that I...
2651986	2652366	and many more.
2674141	2674761	are doing well.
2676202	2680505	There are folks who actually were in Ultramix 2 that are quite familiar with the video game music stuff.
2680685	2685867	Jesper Kidd, I know, is one of them, and he's done a lot of previous video game stuff, and now he's kind of crossing over into DDR.
2685907	2694032	So, you know, there's lots of, I think, opportunities for making great music for video games out there, you know, especially what they keep saying is getting bigger than movies now.
2694272	2694692	We'll see.
2694852	2695393	I mean, who knows?
2695593	2695873	Who knows?
2696587	2703190	Alright, I know you're going to be putting in a live appearance at this upcoming convention, this OtakuCon, is that what it's called?
2703610	2704591	OtakuCon?
2705591	2706312	What's going on with that?
2706352	2707212	How'd you get involved with that?
2708693	2711654	Again, you know, my label got involved in that.
2712015	2720299	They were contacted, a different drum was contacted by OtakuCon about having a different drum be involved, and of course...
2721658	2728441	Because of my involvement in DDR, I was one of the first artists contacted to be in that.
2729602	2732523	The otakus love DDR, just so you know.
2732663	2733824	Oh yeah, yeah.
2733844	2737466	So we'll be performing that track live on stage.
2739526	2742288	Just so you guys know, that's going to be in Miami Beach.
2742448	2747310	If any of you guys are in that area or planning on traveling, the convention is happening December 17th through the 19th.
2747350	2750272	If you want to check out more information, it's otakucon.com.
2750292	2751092	The midi head is going to be there.
2754060	2756662	I'll be there with some Tasty Babes up on stage, my friend.
2756902	2758844	I always perform with Tasty Babes.
2758864	2760346	You've got to have the dual sex appeal.
2760366	2763148	Well, you know, they actually do have talent.
2775772	2776552	and so on.
2796431	2797232	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2821992	2826636	I really, to be honest, I had no clue a lot of this music was out there before DDR.
2827036	2835723	It was kind of like, because of my involvement with this show, I kind of, you know, when this music was announced, I kind of went on over to the site and I was kind of checking out some of the music by the artists.
2835763	2836784	I was like, this stuff is great.
2837305	2838125	This stuff is really great.
2838226	2841949	And, you know, it's stuff you probably wouldn't hear of if you didn't think to look.
2841989	2843610	It's definitely not the mainstream.
2843630	2844110	Definitely not.
2844250	2845692	I mean, it's synth pop.
2846592	2849235	And what's interesting, though, is because...
2850320	2854881	I don't know how old you guys are, but I don't know if you remember the 80s at all.
2855781	2856321	A little bit.
2856701	2858262	A guano girl is lighting up over there.
2858282	2859562	It was a blur, man.
2859622	2861062	If it makes you feel better, I'm 27.
2861702	2863663	I was just passing out of the uterus then.
2863683	2865683	No, no, no, no.
2866003	2869224	I may sound young, but I'm actually 26, so I do remember the 80s.
2869264	2870444	You're not that young, man.
2870544	2871584	Okay, all right, cool.
2871924	2872544	We remember the 80s.
2872604	2873005	It's all good.
2875755	2883899	I used to DJ in the 80s, and so a lot of the music that comes off via different drum label is kind of reminiscent of that era.
2885619	2886740	That's what I'm loving, too.
2886800	2894663	Like the Naropa song, I remember when I heard that the first time, I was like, it's like Depeche Mode meets Erasure meets, like, cool.
2894723	2895644	I just loved it.
2896707	2898408	Definitely a lot of 80s remnants and stuff in there.
2898809	2899889	Very cool.
2899950	2901351	I just wanted to pass this along to you now.
2901391	2905254	We actually have somebody in our chat room right now over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
2905274	2905734	Click on chat.
2906074	2908136	Somebody that works for Konami.
2908776	2916702	And he actually says that their product manager, Jason Enos, said that Akira has heard the remix you did and he likes it a lot.
2917183	2918143	And I'm supposed to let you know.
2918584	2919284	I'm supposed to let you know.
2920265	2922187	Right on.
2922287	2924989	Wow, I'm glad that the information could come to us that fast.
2925029	2926050	God bless the internet.
2926070	2926490	Look at that.
2927006	2929487	A first ever in the life of Middy Head.
2929527	2930847	He hears from the man himself.
2931987	2932888	Well, I'm not really the man.
2933248	2935288	Live on Orange Lounge Radio.
2936649	2938889	That was my best Roger Radio voice, by the way.
2939189	2940790	Welcome to the Morning Drive.
2941390	2944571	Welcome to the Morning Drive.
2948629	2951271	Let's go on over to Iguana Girl and check on that traffic.
2951892	2955335	We've got an accident on the I-5.
2955715	2964802	I used to intern at a Top 40 radio station back when I was 14 years old is when I started to get into radio.
2967004	2975230	I sat down in the general manager's office at the radio station about the time I was 16 years old, and he said, Mike,
2975974	2980660	I'm sorry to tell you this, but I don't think you have the voice for radio.
2981361	2986208	So I passed up the career, guys.
2987109	2990053	I know it sounds like I should have stuck with it, but...
2993317	2998299	I have to admit, I've hit a few roadblocks on my way up the radio ladder.
2998319	3000100	So that's why I'm stuck here doing internet radio.
3000420	3009064	But see, the way I figure is that together, when we work together like this, when the indie labels come together with the indie radio stations, we're going to take over the world!
3010325	3011045	Yeah, man!
3011105	3012245	Define and conquer!
3013446	3014386	Power to the people!
3016027	3016447	Right on.
3017108	3018008	Let's see, what...
3019488	3021650	What other kind of future projects are you working on right now?
3021670	3023652	I know you've done work for TV and movies.
3023712	3025634	Is there anything else upcoming that we can look forward to?
3027956	3032120	Yeah, I'm going to be in several B-movies.
3034101	3037585	Since I'm in the Los Angeles area, there will be some of the adult film.
3040247	3041228	Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
3041428	3043370	Okay, I hope everybody knows I'm just kidding.
3044275	3044595	You were?
3044695	3046456	No, yeah, yeah, okay, we're not kidding.
3047236	3049196	And I was looking forward to some Bow Chicka Bow Wow.
3049856	3051217	Bow Chicka Bow Wow.
3051697	3059679	But no, I'm actually working on a new album, and the title of the album is called Weapons of Mass Seduction.
3062219	3063500	That sounds porno right there.
3064120	3073062	Well, you know, I was afraid of that originally when I thought of the title, but because of my frustration with the media...
3074271	3080536	and pretty much just turning on the local television stations here in California.
3080576	3081897	I don't know.
3081977	3092344	I don't want to get into politics, but I'm more of a conservative kind of guy than I would say liberal.
3092364	3093184	It just frustrates me.
3094318	3096619	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3125324	3130086	If they like that remix and are thinking, hmm, I want to check out some more Midihead stuff, where can they go to check some stuff out?
3130766	3132687	Well, I think you said it earlier.
3132707	3133507	Everybody with me, ready?
3134608	3139710	www.midihead.com Works for me, works for me.
3141290	3143371	You have other albums out there right now too, right?
3143391	3150694	Yeah, I have the first album I released called Power Undiminished.
3152091	3161837	The American Synth Pop Award in 2001 here in Hollywood, California for Best Album.
3162838	3170282	Also, more recently than that, Dividing Asunder.
3172443	3180108	I'm actually going to be doing my own radio broadcast here sometime next year.
3180618	3194131	in the month of December before OtakuCon, where there will be a world premiere listening of my latest track, which has not been released yet, and that one's titled Away From Here.
3194851	3195352	Oh, okay.
3196253	3201698	So I guess just check the website for that information, and I'll keep you posted.
3202038	3202458	Sounds good.
3202478	3205361	So you're trying to break into the Internet radio world as well, huh?
3205976	3208818	Well, no, not... You know, I think it's fun.
3208838	3212240	You know, what you guys are doing, it sounds like you guys are having a good time.
3212460	3212680	Oh, yeah.
3212881	3217544	And, you know, I've always wanted to do my own show since I was a small kid.
3218584	3220886	And Internet has allowed us to do that.
3221426	3221966	Absolutely.
3222427	3225969	And, you know, I'm just going to try it out and see how I like it.
3226539	3229341	and maybe I'll do a once a month broadcast or something.
3229561	3231163	Be careful, it's really addicting.
3231923	3233965	Iguana Girl, how long have we been doing this?
3234005	3236607	You've been doing it for a couple years at least?
3237027	3238888	Well, yeah, probably like four or five now.
3238968	3243572	I've been involved in various shows for probably about five or six years, so it's pretty addicting.
3244219	3247340	You guys are doing Live 365, right?
3247440	3250480	Yeah, this current program we're doing is through Live 365, Orange Sounds Radio.
3250540	3253441	And they're great to us, too.
3253521	3256561	So they've got a lot of great services for anybody that's looking into.
3257562	3264763	Even when they forgot to mention our name at the Best of Live 365 Awards, in which we were nominated in a category, and they completely forgot us.
3265563	3266523	That's a tragedy, man.
3266744	3267664	We forgave them for it.
3267684	3268944	Do we have the clip?
3271556	3272496	I wish we had the clip.
3272556	3277498	I would love for Mitty Head to hear the clip because it's hilarious and I don't think our listeners have heard the clip in a long time either.
3277518	3278798	I'll have to dig that up.
3278978	3284140	Wait, did they actually, you recorded the clip of them apologizing?
3284160	3293822	Yes, the whole thing was broadcasted live and one of our listeners recorded it and sent the whole thing to us because it's hilarious because you can hear us in the background going, Hey!
3294423	3295723	They forgot our name.
3296983	3297624	It's pretty funny.
3299565	3302847	Anyway, I wanted to go ahead and allow our listeners a chance to ask some questions.
3303227	3308530	OrangeLoungeRadio.com, click on chat, and you can submit some questions live to us via our chat room.
3309130	3312052	For instance, we have Legend of Zaku is in our chat room.
3312072	3313113	He has a question for you here.
3313473	3317255	He wants to know, how did you approach doing the remixing itself?
3317335	3321217	In other words, what kind of inspired you to go about making the remix that you did?
3322918	3325019	I think that I wanted to come from a...
3329353	3331074	A cinematic sort of feel.
3331715	3341820	If you listen to the beginning of the track, it kind of starts out with some heavy, thunderous noises and stuff like that.
3341880	3352865	So I kind of wanted it to be a very intense track, because I felt the vocal was conveying a sort of intensity there, and a seriousness.
3353906	3354006	Yeah.
3355019	3356219	Does that answer the question?
3356359	3357840	I think so, I think so.
3358420	3363281	They're responding to it in chat, they're saying, kind of giving it that epic sound, a little bit.
3363301	3367422	Yeah, I wanted to, you know, but that's kind of how my sound is, hence the name Monolithic.
3367582	3371123	I mean, everything I do has an epic kind of sound to it.
3371263	3378685	Now that was something that we didn't quite kind of get into a little bit there before, but you actually work under several different names, not just Midihead, but Monolithic as well.
3379265	3379685	That's right.
3379865	3380665	So are there any other...
3381471	3383312	pseudonyms that you use as well for music?
3383393	3386575	Well, there is the sexy skinny guy.
3389157	3389537	Hey, wait a minute.
3389557	3390418	I thought that was my name.
3390438	3395202	I had the trademark on that name.
3395902	3396463	Let's see.
3397083	3397924	Yeah, Trent Reznor.
3398284	3399825	You know him?
3399945	3400686	Okay, all right.
3402347	3402808	No, no.
3402908	3403788	No, I'm sorry.
3404009	3406050	I wouldn't want to own up to that guy.
3406691	3409313	I mean, he's got great talent and everything.
3409333	3409573	He just
3410236	3410976	That's a different direction.
3410996	3411557	He's just crazy.
3412177	3414178	A little different direction.
3415119	3419301	You know what's interesting is there's actually one guy that does a lot, a lot of music for DDR and Naoki.
3419321	3421182	I don't know if you've heard of him or not.
3421222	3421882	He's got a lot of tracks.
3422202	3427245	But that guy probably has like, what, 20 to 30 different pseudonyms he's done music under.
3427605	3428205	It's crazy.
3428285	3429446	You know what?
3429546	3430347	That's the way you do it.
3430587	3434169	I don't know how many of the pseudonyms you know that Prince has.
3434189	3434589	True.
3434829	3438431	But Prince has tons and tons of pseudonyms.
3438471	3438771	He's really...
3439167	3439347	and so on.
3462611	3463892	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3486190	3488632	We have a comment from Sigurd in our chatroom.
3488652	3492635	He's the guy that actually works at Konami, and what Sigurd did at Konami is he was one of the testers.
3492655	3497359	Wait a minute, before you get going here, is this chatroom just full of folks from Konami here?
3497900	3499641	No, just the one.
3499881	3504905	Otherwise, it's just fanboys and girls just like the rest of us that just love the games.
3505586	3511591	Sigurd's one of those cases where he was someone that was a fan and then actually kind of got in the door and got to work on one of the games.
3511971	3512731	That's cool.
3512852	3514473	Yeah, he's a great guy.
3514953	3515734	He's been on the show before.
3515774	3516514	We like having him on.
3516534	3518516	In fact, we might have him on later tonight.
3518776	3522759	But he worked on the steps, actually, part of the steps for DDR.
3523060	3529645	And he wanted you to know that the step creation team thought that your song was easily one of the top songs that they had to work with.
3529905	3530906	So he just wanted to pass that along.
3531606	3532307	Oh, that's great.
3532467	3533368	Tell him thank you.
3534308	3535750	I think he's listening, so hopefully he heard that.
3536270	3536870	Oh, thank you.
3536930	3537911	You're a sweet man.
3538592	3539152	I love you.
3540854	3541775	and No I'm Not Gay.
3543696	3544017	Alright.
3544197	3545338	I mean that plutonically.
3546538	3546879	Alright.
3547419	3553264	Flaronay has a question, wants to know what other artists from the different drum label have you collaborated with in the past?
3554385	3556086	I've actually collaborated with a couple of them.
3556126	3557767	I want to do more collaboration.
3559188	3563912	I've just, well I'll just tell you that the artists I've done work with are NeuroActive.
3565914	3568816	I did a song with, his name's Jarko.
3570058	3571478	and obviously he's not American.
3573539	3583822	I did a song called Fiberoptic Rhythm and he sent me the music over the internet and I wrote the song, sent it back to him and he put it on the album.
3585962	3594185	I haven't really done much collaboration.
3595714	3598216	There's collaboration to be had, I know that.
3598497	3606003	I've been speaking with Jeff Pinckney of The Nine, one of my other favorite ADD label artists.
3607485	3611969	He's actually working with me right now doing some music for my publisher.
3614551	3618014	Hopefully he and I will be collaborating on some stuff in the future.
3619249	3619990	Alright, cool.
3620450	3622651	Let's do one more question from our chat here.
3622671	3632678	We have MJB wants to know, are there any other songs in Bomani, which is what we call the music games that Konami puts out, including DDR and BBNA 2DX, etc.
3632878	3636121	Are there any other songs you've considered remixing in the series?
3636161	3643146	Has doing this remix you've already done kind of made you want to remix some other songs there in Bomani?
3643866	3645027	Well, you know, it's
3646045	3651346	Asking me if I want to remix something is like asking me if I want to wake up in the morning and have breakfast.
3654266	3655587	It's just a matter of choices.
3655907	3658747	I've got a whole cabinet full of cereal.
3658787	3661548	Do I pick the corn checks or the wheat checks?
3665168	3672269	I'm not project-less, so I have my plate fairly full all the time with music projects.
3672289	3672990	Doing music for...
3675802	3676943	for television libraries.
3676963	3677963	It keeps me fairly busy.
3678183	3679224	Of course, I have my day job.
3679764	3682785	I don't really go out and seek after remix work.
3683265	3689008	Remix work, if somebody needs something done, they'll usually ask me now.
3689128	3690188	I used to have to seek it out.
3690869	3694410	That's when you know you've made it big time, when they come find you.
3694430	3696831	When you've made it big time, you've bought your home in Hollywood Hills.
3700077	3708064	Alright, well, that's going to do it for the questions from our chat, but actually, we wanted to kind of wrap up and go to a song.
3708084	3709005	We're actually going to play something.
3709245	3712508	I wasn't, unfortunately, Middyhead, able to get that song that you sent me over email.
3712548	3719634	For some reason, my email's not coming up with a new message, so I thought maybe we could play a track from Diving Asunder, I'm sorry, Dividing Asunder, actually.
3720675	3722016	I thought maybe we could do a song from there.
3722436	3727721	And, Middyhead, you're actually going to give some of our listeners some free stuff tonight, as I understand it?
3728785	3733588	Yeah, actually, we've got a couple of really great prizes to give away.
3735729	3741833	We've got a deep-sea fishing in the Salt Lake, the Great Salt Lake.
3741893	3748357	We have some deep-sea carp fishing trips to give away.
3748377	3751179	Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
3751947	3754269	I don't think that was in the email I saw.
3754609	3758672	Are you sure that wasn't like the Ryan Seacrest show or something?
3759373	3760814	Ice fishing in Alaska.
3764276	3770621	Actually, we're going to give away a couple of CDs from Dividing Ascender.
3771702	3773583	A couple of monolithic CDs, Dividing Ascender.
3774424	3780028	And if you want, I'll also pick a couple of listeners to...
3782369	3783530	to get some free downloads.
3786012	3793117	You can purchase MP3s off of MIDIhead.com as well of my previous albums if you want to get them in electronic format.
3793417	3795018	And Loki says he's already bought all three.
3795378	3795538	Yep.
3795759	3796539	All three albums.
3798200	3800422	Dude, I appreciate you, man.
3800682	3801102	Thank you.
3801283	3801703	No problem.

3829848	3833651	So send on over an email to Freestuff at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
3833991	3835992	Middy Head, thank you so much for being here on the show tonight.
3836012	3836733	We appreciate it.
3837493	3838334	You're welcome, guys.
3838374	3838974	It's a pleasure.
3839074	3840315	Did anybody else hear in the room?
3840515	3842096	It's been kind of quiet here in the room.
3842136	3844357	I think we've just all been kind of... We've been absorbing.
3844377	3845598	Yeah, Middy Head's so entertaining.
3845618	3846738	We're like sponges.
3848219	3848940	I hear crickets.
3849360	3850140	What's going on over there?
3850821	3851061	Oh, no.
3851441	3853863	We're just mesmerized by your every word.
3854103	3854583	Fanboys.
3854983	3857345	Well, that was a safe answer.
3858665	3858925	All right.
3858946	3860226	Well, we do appreciate you being here.
3860246	3863168	Wish you the best of luck, and I hope we get to talk to you again in the future, all right?
3863903	3864584	I'm sure you will.
3864744	3865085	All right.
3865245	3866046	You take care of yourself.
3866086	3867347	Have a good night.
3867588	3869330	My love goes out to everyone listening.
3869790	3872073	And have a happy holiday, everyone.
3872253	3872594	You too.
3873255	3873555	Thanks.
3873715	3874015	All right.
3874055	3874496	Take care.
3874516	3874957	Thank you.
3876604	3877684	All right, that was good.
3878385	3879045	What a nice guy.
3879065	3880045	Awesome, very cool.
3880146	3885488	I would like to say out there to our listeners, and I'm quoting, he uses acid.
3885848	3889229	I'm fucking going on every Bomani board and saying he fucking uses acid.
3889870	3890550	Fuck you guys.
3890810	3892551	I'm entering the damn contest with acid.
3892991	3896412	That's what I was trying to get at when I cut him off.
3896693	3902115	How rude of me to cut the guy off while I'm interviewing him to make that very point, Loki, that...
3902873	3905756	The professionals are using acid, so shut up.
3906576	3908738	And let Loki use acid in the contest, people.
3909499	3915724	All you have to do is just make a nice little sound clip out of it, post it on the board and say, okay, listen to this, boom.
3916365	3922089	You know, I associate like, you know, like a banner or something, you know, acid is midi head approved.
3922109	3922270	Okay.
3925658	3929440	Anyway, once again, you guys, free stuff at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
3929560	3930261	Just send an email.
3930401	3932462	That's all you have to do, and you might win some free stuff.
3932902	3934003	Middy Head, great guy.
3934543	3936004	He's a child of the 80s.
3936184	3936925	What else can he say?
3937545	3938366	Can't complain about that.
3939006	3940747	He's a man after my own heart.
3940787	3941868	The whole dissent thing.
3942765	3944946	I'm like, oh my god, I used to play that when I was a kid.
3945006	3946947	We're going to have to invite him out for drinks at E3.
3947127	3947648	Seriously.
3947688	3948168	Seriously.
3948248	3949589	I hope he can make it.
3949689	3950009	All right.
3950249	3951350	Anyway, let's check out.
3951590	3954892	Let's stop gushing for a minute here and let's hear some music.
3954912	3958173	We're going to hear a track from the CD we're giving away tonight, Dividing Asunder.
3958593	3963556	This song is called Lulling Us to Sleep, which this show sometimes does to people, but not tonight.
3963596	3964136	Not tonight.
3964156	3968699	So we're going to hear this track and we will be right back with more Orange Lounge Radio.
3979908	3981350	Thank you for watching!
4014051	4037831	We are walking in our sleep And though our eyes are open Our slumber is so deep We rinse our souls with tearful face Our hypnotist has spoken The lullaby we sing
4106571	4109014	Sorry guys, we're having some technical difficulties there.
4109575	4112418	I know, Bad Me, that song is rocking too.
4112478	4113078	Sorry guys.
4113319	4114099	Say it again.
4114420	4117703	Internet radio is broke, left and right.
4117743	4118424	What can I say?
4118584	4120266	Hold on, let's try this again.
4120687	4122068	No, that was my question also.
4122148	4123149	Is MidiHead singing it?
4123329	4124671	I think so.
4124771	4125272	I'm not sure.
4125492	4126052	Sorry guys.
4168260	4169101	Thanks for watching!
4221564	4222988	Thank you for watching!
4245733	4247358	Thank you for watching!
4315035	4315796	Thanks for watching!

4342027	4347792	Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

4348891	4350332	Sorry for the technical difficulties there.
4350752	4352033	It's, you know, internet radio.
4352873	4353353	What can you say?
4354254	4357095	Monolithic, Lulling Us to Sleep, awesome song.
4357135	4359216	It's getting a great response in the chat room there.
4360076	4361377	This song is kicking ass.
4361857	4363238	This song is fucking hot.
4363638	4365199	Midi Head is the shit, etc., etc.
4365919	4369200	I'm sure MidiHead is happy to know that he's got plenty of new fanboys and girls there.
4369240	4372022	And just being such a nice guy, especially there on the interview there.
4372042	4373622	So thanks again to MidiHead for being on the program.

4387008	4387288	Grr.
4388564	4388844	Don't cheat.
4388864	4389424	Cheaters don't prosper.
4389444	4390045	People should know this by now.
4390065	4390725	If you cheat, you don't win.
4390745	4390865	Period.
4390885	4391065	Exactly.
4391085	4392686	Speaking of winning, we have another giveaway that's still going on.
4423089	4424530	That's right, boys and girls.
4424670	4431793	It's time to conclude our signed Akira Yamaoka CD giveaway that's been going on the station for the past two weeks.
4432494	4436236	Jazz was our lucky winner last week of an autographed Akira Yamaoka CD.
4436776	4438176	Minidisc, Silent Hill 4.
4438497	4440057	You guys have been listening throughout the week.
4440498	4446560	Monday nights, Diversion, the Orange Launch Radio Remix show, where remixes and acid are A-OK by us.
4448383	4454509	and Tuesday nights to DarkSakura and her lovely program, Pump Up the Volume, and Thursday nights to Outside the Box.
4454569	4458874	And now, we're going to find ourselves a winner for the second signed Akira Yamaoka CD.
4458894	4461376	We're giving away so much free stuff tonight, I can't handle it.
4462377	4463678	All right, Loki, find us a winner.
4466661	4467162	Who is it?
4469404	4472067	The winner is Dork!
4473581	4475383	Akira Yamaoka Signs CD
4496312	4497453	Thank you for watching!
4521363	4521863	Let's see.
4522584	4523825	Moving on with the program.
4523885	4525646	Gosh, where do we begin?
4525726	4527247	Where do we go?
4528047	4528388	News?
4528708	4529848	What's going on in the news world?
4529868	4531289	What's going on in the sim scene, Loki?
4531329	4535332	I know there's stuff going on in the sim world right now, in the worlds of DDR simulation.
4535952	4536493	He's thinking.
4536613	4537734	Is there anything going on this week?
4538534	4539455	Not really, no.
4541096	4542236	Not at all, actually.
4544011	4546373	And how the, no, no, no, no, nothing.
4546533	4548495	Well, I guess one little thing to mention.
4549035	4557382	Um, Bomani Style, post-sending, if you guys are Guitar Freaks, Drum Mania fans, they have the sim files for, um, Guitar Freaks, I think, 1 through 10.
4558203	4560244	And you can get those in their media shop there.
4560465	4563407	And it's, you know, it's got all your, uh, GDA files for, um,
4564262	4568243	DTX Mania which is a sim and those type of things.
4568483	4585628	So if you want more information, first off, download the sims in the media shop on BomayiStyle and check out their session simulation forums on BomayiStyle as well for all your information on how to actually use those sim files and play around with them.
4586228	4586788	They're a lot of fun.
4588269	4589209	Alright, very cool.
4590378	4592479	This is a news story that's in right now.
4592760	4598363	It doesn't really necessarily relate to DDR completely, but I thought it was interesting because there's some games in here that are definitely worth mentioning.
4598843	4601864	Time Magazine has announced their top ten video games of the year.
4601885	4603205	You guys ready to hear this?
4603225	4604826	The top ten video... Uh-oh.
4605867	4606787	And sorry, guys.
4607147	4608968	DDR, not on it.
4609288	4610329	Karaoke, not on it.
4610809	4611890	Bomani, not on it.
4612030	4614571	Well, Karaoke Revolution did win it last year, if I remember right.
4614611	4617633	So, you know, I guess it's Bomani's turn to take a back...
4618410	4618630	Pirates
4642396	4643658	Army D, it's Pirates.
4643998	4644999	What is that?
4645059	4647202	It's an adventure RPG game, and I believe it's on the PC.
4647222	4648042	Yeah, I think so.
4649504	4649904	Pirates.
4650045	4650265	Okay.
4650285	4651967	Not to be confused with Puzzle Pirates.
4652127	4655010	Yes, not to be confused with Puzzle Pirates.
4655070	4659615	Number nine, Fable for the Xbox, that role-playing game.
4659635	4662718	That's the one where you can marry a guy in it, if you play the cards right.
4663999	4664460	Pretty awesome.
4665253	4670557	Number 8, Burnout 3, Takedown, another racing and crashing game.
4670617	4672418	Loki's giving the thumbs up to that, any particular reason?
4673058	4676620	Well, the first one was awesome, and this one looked really good, but I just have no interest in buying games.
4678722	4685046	Number 7, and I'm actually surprised it's kind of low because everybody in the gaming community has a huge boner about Halo 2.
4685899	4688301	Battlefield Vietnam, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas
4711858	4714421	If you haven't heard about Grand Theft Auto, it's time to come out of your hole.
4733028	4736289	So what rolled over Grand Theft Auto to land in fourth place?
4736670	4737950	Katamari Damacy.
4738070	4739531	Yay!
4739791	4741891	Number four, I know there's a lot of folks in here.
4741911	4743792	Best underground hit ever.
4744112	4748554	Honestly, it's the sleeper hit probably so far this decade.
4748754	4751195	Seriously, it's the biggest sleeper hit I've ever seen.
4752475	4755076	Number three, a little game you might have heard of.
4755558	4756058	Half-Life 2.
4757179	4758480	I don't know if you guys know the Half-Life.
4758500	4759501	You ever heard of Half-Life?
4759721	4762023	Yeah, I think so.
4762103	4763484	A long time ago, yeah.
4764124	4770729	Number two, and always in magazines, there are these games that kind of come out of nowhere to land at number two.
4771170	4775793	And in this case, it's a strategy game, and I'm sure strategy gamers out there are going to go, Sky, you idiot!
4777274	4780917	Rome Total War is the name of the game.
4780977	4781578	I've never heard of it.
4781798	4782518	Cricket.
4782558	4783019	Cricket, Cricket.
4783039	4783279	Cricket.
4784288	4785369	You guys are idiots!
4786450	4788091	What do you mean you don't play strategy games?
4788111	4789372	This is the best strategy game ever.
4789693	4791774	I'm so glad I don't have headphones right now.
4791794	4793295	That sounds so lame.
4794376	4795317	Rome Total War.
4795417	4795577	Hey!
4795597	4799740	Wait a second, wasn't that that stupid game that Capcom was pushing or something?
4799941	4806566	That was like some sort of, almost like Melgar Solid in Greek Roman times, you know?
4807847	4808948	Was that the game?
4808988	4810809	Because that one looked really lame.
4810849	4813071	And every time I saw it on their big screen, I'd laugh at it.
4815463	4817465	All right, you want to know what the number one game of the year is?
4817485	4819326	Wait, wait, I have to interrupt you real quick.
4819346	4819566	Okay.
4819947	4821708	MidiHead has joined us in our chat room.
4822008	4822469	Really?
4822629	4823950	Yes.
4825151	4825791	Wow.
4825851	4827973	Well, welcome, MidiHead, to join in the chat there.
4828893	4832716	Go give him the same praise you were giving earlier while that song was playing, honestly.
4832756	4834718	Inflate his ego a little more, please.
4835378	4837900	I'm sure we'll send you a check for that.
4838781	4840562	You can send us a check for that later.
4840642	4840782	Okay.
4843320	4844120	Number one.
4844420	4846521	The number one game of the year according to Time Magazine.
4846681	4849042	And I think Loki could possibly agree with this one.
4849062	4849582	I'm not sure.
4849662	4852342	Based on the murder simulation he has created in.
4852382	4853043	The Sims 2.
4853223	4858924	That I'll actually give the number one rating to because at E3 that just was phenomenal.
4859264	4860485	What is coming out for The Sims 2?
4860785	4865626	But not only the first expansion pack where The Sims go to college.
4867166	4868227	I kid you not.
4868287	4869227	They go to college.
4869447	4871428	They join in on spring break.
4871588	4872308	Frat parties.
4872628	4872988	It is
4874335	4874635	Wow.
4874675	4877439	Sims 2 going to school.
4879762	4881304	Do we get to get Sims drunk now?
4882225	4885709	I just... How many expansion packs are they going to make for this Sims game, honestly?
4885809	4891336	How many did they do for... I'm waiting for like the adult Ed Powers version.
4891997	4892818	The hardcore...
4895219	4900323	No, that'd be Playboy, the mansion game, you know, where you manage the Playboy mansion.
4900343	4901123	That looks horrible.
4901263	4905647	And just, like, watch chicks run around naked that are, like, stupid looking.
4906167	4913692	That's about as fun as Leisure Suit Larry, the new one, which I beat, and I gotta say, it was kind of lame.
4914273	4915114	It was kind of lame.
4916394	4918716	Okay, was it at least enjoyable?
4919937	4922479	It was enjoyable after I took the censorship off.
4925476	4933841	You have to love any game, though, that allows you to be a sperm trying to make it through, you know, and avoiding, you know, different blocks to try to make it through the egg.
4934382	4935022	That was pretty funny.
4935222	4939085	Oh, yeah.
4939265	4943388	Any overlooked games, you guys think, for the top ten of the year?
4944268	4945689	Besides Ultramix 2.
4946670	4952434	God, you know, it's good Katamari made it because otherwise I would have been like, what? !
4953726	4956408	Yeah, Metal Gear Solid 3.
4957969	4959930	I'm actually a little bit surprised.
4961051	4966354	I'm wondering if it was because the release date was so late that something such as Smackdown vs. Raw wouldn't have made it.
4966874	4969456	Just because, I mean, it's amazing.
4969576	4971077	It is utterly amazing.
4971257	4971677	F that!
4971757	4972718	Rumble Roses!
4972858	4974259	Where's my Rumble Roses?
4975220	4978522	Yeah, but you have to admit that the playthrough mode, the...
4979342	5007995	The Story Mode Oh my god, that's horrible Even Sigurd agrees with me in chat there Rumble Roses was far overlooked It was, but that, you know The Story Mode is just Although the game is getting horrible reviews Oh come on Oh sure, they give, you know, DOA Beach Volleyball good reviews But no, this one actually has gameplay Oh, it's interrupting my watching them walk around Dammit I actually have to play this one?
5008795	5009495	That sucks!
5009796	5011516	It's interrupting the jiggle scenes, dammit.
5011957	5018280	They should have DOA versus Rumble Roses and just like one all-naked-fest mud-wrestling game.
5018320	5018920	There you go.
5019060	5019580	There you go.
5019740	5020621	I totally agree.
5020861	5025423	Not enough nakedness in games, I guess.
5025503	5026343	Where was the guy game?
5028689	5030210	I have never played the guy game.
5030230	5031331	I've only heard about this game.
5031351	5032251	Have you played the guy game?
5032271	5034153	Yes, I have to admit, I did rent it.
5034553	5035934	What the hell is up with the guy game?
5035954	5037035	Tell me about the guy game.
5037315	5045880	Okay, the guy game was apparently filmed spring break last year at some place in Texas where they were just basically asking women trivia questions.
5045980	5047742	And these women are dumb as rocks.
5048802	5049663	I mean, let's be honest here.
5050563	5056047	And the first part of the game is to see which one of the four players will get it right.
5056147	5057528	And then the second part is
5058447	5060508	to figure out if the girl's going to get it right.
5061109	5065251	And if you figure that she's going to get it right or wrong... Well, the girl's never going to get it right!
5065391	5066192	I'm just kidding, I'm kidding.
5066372	5068313	No, no, there's a few that actually do, and it's kind of scary.
5068333	5068933	I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
5068953	5071315	Isn't that stolen from Howard Stern?
5071955	5073336	Or like some other talk show?
5073356	5076918	Because I know this has been stolen on numerous talk shows.
5076958	5083902	Yeah, it obviously has, but there's this little meter that goes up, and at first it starts off, you know, if they get it wrong, they have to flash their tits.
5084383	5086384	And so it first starts off... Jesus Christ!
5087134	5092916	So it first starts off with them flashing and it has the guy game logo across their chest.
5093456	5099318	You get the level up a little bit higher and all of a sudden the logo disappears but their boobies are pixelated.
5100018	5100838	So it's kind of fuzzy.
5101298	5104199	And then you get to the last level where it's totally uncensored.
5105559	5111321	And you can replay the level and see all these girls topless and it's just kind of
5112685	5116767	Head Scratching, you know, mind-boggling, just what the hell are they thinking?
5116787	5118448	Like BMX XXX?
5119128	5123430	You know, I have that game, and I can't play it because it gives me, like, motion sickness.
5123950	5124771	I love that game.
5125531	5127732	And the movies are awesome in it.
5127792	5129333	The final movies kick ass.
5129353	5130253	Yeah, I have to admit that.
5130293	5132234	Asian schoolgirl stripping.
5134615	5137177	I'm surprised that this game isn't still number one today.
5139230	5140092	But no, the guy game.
5140193	5140714	Oh my goodness.
5140754	5141777	Yes, I'm shocked.
5141837	5144243	The guy game is not the number one game of the year.
5144523	5145225	So, shocked.
5148576	5150697	Anyway, I think now's a good time to call it a break.
5151057	5151457	Go on, girl.
5151477	5155838	I notice you're purposefully quiet over there during discussions with the guy game.
5156158	5158038	I was just telling Middyhead goodbye.
5158638	5159139	Oh, he left?
5159159	5160079	He took off?
5160099	5161379	Did our chat room scare him off?
5161539	5164400	I was being all nice to your guests and everything.
5164940	5171522	All I know is I looked in the chat room and somebody said that they were jizzing their pants when they listened to the Middyhead song and I'm just like, I better not read anymore.
5172942	5174322	Honestly, I better not read anymore.
5175703	5176623	No, I love our listeners.
5176803	5177223	They're great.

5609838	5613219	Orange Lounge Radio With the Ping Pong Ball
5632119	5634520	Anyway, Middy had actually sent me an email during the break there.
5634820	5638162	And he wants you guys to know that, yes, that was him singing in that song.
5638242	5639003	Oh, wow.
5639023	5641604	For those of you guys that wanted to know if that was his voice, yes, that was him singing.
5642064	5642865	Very impressed.
5642965	5645766	And he's sending me a new song of his to play.
5645906	5646647	Very cool.
5646847	5648908	And we'll be playing that at the end of the show.
5648928	5649588	Looking forward to that.
5649848	5652289	Don't forget, guys, free stuff at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
5652810	5656232	And if you missed the interview tonight or any part of it, don't worry.
5656512	5657592	You get a second chance.
5657712	5658793	You get second helpings.
5659446	5668268	Thanks to DDR Freak Radio, who's going to be rebroadcasting it on December 10th, 6 o'clock, as they do every Friday night, our little show over there.
5668508	5670029	Orange Lounge Radio Rewind.
5670149	5671649	Yep, so, very cool.
5671689	5677330	And of course, some of you guys may be thinking, well, didn't you guys used to do the rewinds on your own damn station, Sky?
5677991	5684352	Yeah, actually, that's true, but now it is the oldie and moldie Wednesday flashback, where we are 100 episodes behind right now.
5684392	5686173	So you can hear what the show sounded like two years ago.
5686733	5687393	It's pretty nuts.
5687413	5687493	Wow.
5688713	5698819	I kind of looked at the chat and some of the response to last week's episode, and I think Misty or somebody had said, it's a good thing I wasn't there, because I would have ripped him a new asshole.
5699179	5706003	So hear what offensive things you missed out on, back on episodes 20 and 21 and all that stuff we're playing way back when, so check it out.
5707463	5709164	Alright, so we're going to get to our...
5711164	5714088	are not a cage match, but something a little different in a little bit.
5714368	5717192	But I wanted to talk first about Taiko Drum Master.
5717793	5720216	It's a game that kind of came out there under our noses.
5720256	5723120	I know we got to check it out at E3, and we told you guys a little bit about it.
5723959	5726861	Huge game in Japan called Taiko no Tachijin in Japan.
5727502	5730524	Basically, for those who don't know what it's about, it's about Taiko drumming.
5730824	5734087	You have these big things that look like breadsticks, and you beat the drum.
5734147	5735788	Either you beat it in the center or you beat it in the side.
5736249	5743014	And so popular in Japan, it was the number one selling game in Japan for a while, that they decided to bring it over to the U.S., call it Taiko Drum Master.
5743414	5745756	And Iguana Girl, you guys actually picked up a copy of it, right?
5745936	5749920	Yep, we purchased a copy over at our local Fry's Electronics for 60 bucks.
5750640	5751041	DarkSakura.com
5767270	5768011	Na, na, na, na, na, na
5785607	5786167	and so on.
5811388	5820093	by the way, I just want to talk about how scary it was that we all burst into song on the Katamari Damashii record a little bit scary there the song is a stroke of genius
5826861	5830123	Those were some songs that we actually got to play at E3.
5831304	5836067	Actually, that was on the Taika No Tatooine original setup.
5836507	5838448	But it was more like the crossover.
5838628	5840830	This is the E3 version of the American game.
5842331	5843911	Actually, the music list is pretty decent.
5845252	5847033	We've only managed to get 31 songs.
5847073	5848214	I don't know if there's further.
5848594	5849535	I think that's the max.
5849595	5851356	We have unlocked the Oni mode.
5852056	5852596	Oh, Oni Mode.
5852656	5853477	It is Oni Mode.
5853517	5862341	Now, I have to ask, or else Rice Princess and Lanky Style would kill me because this is an inside joke from outside the box, but My Sharona is in the game, correct?
5862621	5862881	Yes.
5863421	5864562	Okay, just double check.
5864642	5865602	It is in the game.
5865682	5866642	Okay.
5866823	5870264	There's also, wasn't Love Shack in that?
5870424	5870624	Yes.
5870684	5872125	Yeah.
5872145	5873766	Love Shack is also in that game.
5873986	5874706	I like that song.
5874926	5875666	Yeah.
5875806	5876046	Right?
5876067	5877047	Yeah.
5877876	5879137	Stuff like ABC.
5879558	5880579	Are you going to be my girl?
5880779	5881880	Yeah, that's Ross' favorite.
5881900	5883521	That one's a lot of fun.
5883561	5884202	A lot of fun.
5888129	5890651	There's a Queen song in there, Killer Queen.
5890671	5897698	There's all sorts of songs from Namco's own games, like the theme song from Soul Calibur, Ridge Racer.
5897738	5903042	I remember that the Soul Calibur song, whatever it's called, was one of the stages.
5903303	5905925	Brave Sword, Braver Soul, yeah, whatever.
5906065	5906646	But that's cool.
5906766	5909448	But yeah, it's a good overall mix of music.
5909488	5912871	I mean, they've got a lot of American songs mixed in with...
5914993	5919298	Mixed in with the classical stuff and with their own versions of stuff.
5919318	5922421	Like they have Taiko March and stuff like that.
5922501	5928246	So do you think that the kids that are upset that there's been no US Beatmania as of yet, do you think that this might hold them over a little bit?
5930108	5930789	Maybe.
5931710	5933031	It's more like the...
5935379	5940183	If you were to get this and Donkey Konga, then you've got your whole drum mania thing worked out right there.
5940203	5941705	This is more like a drum mania.
5942145	5951374	That's another ironic bit is that the classical stuff that is in Donkey Konga is the same stuff that's in Taiko Drum Masters.
5951474	5957339	So you could either choose to play the stuff on the bongos or on the Taiko drums.
5958260	5959541	Just all up to you.
5959621	5960582	Something for everyone.
5961082	5964944	Except Katamari on the rocks is not in Donkey Kong.
5964964	5965604	That's too bad.
5966304	5966625	All right.
5967385	5968145	All right, guys.
5968485	5970126	Do we have everything set up over here that we need?
5971367	5971667	Loki?
5972007	5972627	Is something wrong?
5976049	5977349	Okay, he's saying the webcam.
5977369	5978710	I don't care about the webcam.
5978750	5979850	We've got to get the other stuff, though.
5980511	5983472	We are going to get to tonight's cage match, boys and girls.
5983592	5985853	It's time for your favorite segment of the show.
5985913	5988134	Okay, maybe not, but it is the mandatory segment we do every week.
5989804	5999409	Orange Lounge Cage Match, where we pitch three songs against each other, head-to-head, and we see who the winner is.
5999569	6009775	You guys vote, and your favorite song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's 24-hour-a-day, 7-days-a-week, Bomani Music and More program.
6010275	6015178	So, let's see, last week's winner was a little song here.
6015638	6019280	It was actually a Top 40 song that's won the contest for a couple weeks now.
6020157	6021578	It's been winning for a little while now.
6022139	6026963	And it's called... It's by Gwen Stefani.
6028064	6033529	And I'm trying to... Yep, What You Waiting For is the song.
6033869	6037052	This is a clip of last week's winner, What You Waiting For.
6057250	6058371	Okay, that was enough of a clip.
6059753	6065761	So, the question is, do we do another cage match tonight without DarkSakura present?
6067102	6069264	Yes, a standard normal cage match.
6069484	6073066	No, unfortunately, we will not be doing a normal cage match tonight.
6073247	6075448	So Gwen Stefani wins another week by default.
6075728	6079051	Because if we did a cage match without DarkSakura, there'd be hell to pay.
6080152	6083694	There'll be hell to pay.
6083714	6084835	There'll be other hell to pay.
6085055	6088778	Instead of pissing off Jamie, we're going to piss off Loki.
6088818	6090219	Because pissing off Loki is funnier.
6092701	6095283	By doing a... Drumroll, please.
6097611	6099572	Karaoke Cage Match!
6102513	6106234	Alright guys, here's the way the Karaoke Cage Match is going to work.
6107435	6118699	Just like the typical Cage Match, where there's going to be three songs that you're going to get to pick from, and the favorite that you pick will go into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio, just like any other song, alright?
6119960	6122601	But the deal is, is that instead of...
6123274	6128877	It being songs that are out there, you know, and like just songs that we pick out of the blue like we usually do.
6129377	6135240	They'll be songs sung by folks in the studio tonight via Karaoke Revolution Volume 3.
6136941	6139142	And this is a good way for us to check out this game as well.
6140543	6141964	So now you see why Loki's pissed.
6143024	6144385	He bathed me all night.

6566232	6570416	All right, let's see how the chat was like in that one so far.
6570476	6571256	I'm kind of looking there.
6571777	6572998	I heart love Shaq, da-da-da-da-da.
6573018	6574960	Kind of getting some feedback there from the chat room.
6574980	6575400	We'll see.
6576601	6581205	All right, let's go around the room and see what everybody thought of that, starting with Islander.
6581686	6582406	That was a good performance.
6583487	6584408	And on a scale of 1 to 10?
6587311	6587671	7.5 to 8.
6588512	6588892	Loki.
6589873	6593116	I give it a 0 because this was the dumbest fucking Sigma ever.
6594352	6594953	What the hell with you?
6595053	6598716	I'm never letting you run a show ever again by yourself.
6599617	6599897	No.
6601439	6602039	DJ Rangel.
6603080	6605302	Aw, you're just kissing my ass.
6605342	6606824	Jonah, we just walked in.
6606864	6607324	Explosive.
6609386	6613850	Okay, I just walked in and I have to say five.
6613870	6615752	Okay, let's split it first.
6623004	6627806	Hey, what the hell is up with Granny?
6627826	6628746	Granny's rocking.
6628906	6630847	I love for Granny.
6631227	6632467	Alright, Islander's next.
6632527	6634028	What song are you going to sing for us, Islander?
6634368	6635829	Oh lord, let me take a look at the list here.
6635849	6636589	Uh-oh.
6638329	6639050	Not that list.
6639150	6639490	Wrong.
6640630	6641391	Let's try this again.
6641611	6644572	I do not sing well.
6644632	6648133	I do not like...
6657383	6660204	Alright, he's going through and finding his song right now, what he wants to sing.
6663404	6668525	He was thinking about the Fugees, but passed on it.
6672166	6672806	Maybe Dido?
6673926	6674746	Oh, Hoobastank!
6675407	6675607	No?
6678567	6679067	ABC.
6681768	6682868	Against All Odds is in there.
6683268	6684488	You guys know that one from DDR.
6685889	6687069	He's thinking about Hoobastank.
6689299	6691101	All right, he's giving his nod.
6691621	6692462	And he hit the X button.
6692622	6693342	He's stuck with it now.
6693682	6703490	All right, Islander, song number two in tonight's cage match.
6704390	6705832	All right, song number two in tonight's cage match.
6706352	6708013	Islander, The Reason.
6708914	6714638	I wish this was volume one, because in that song I could do... Oh, hell, what the hell was it?
6714658	6715379	From Vertical Horizons?
6726307	6735070	I'm not a perfect person There's many things I wish I didn't do But could I continue to
6747894	6761121	I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know I found a reason for me To change who I am
6776127	6786572	The reason to start over new And the reason is you It's only that I hurt you It's lost in a much deeper day
6799925	6811894	And all the pain I put you through I wish that I could take it all away And be the one who catches all your tears That's why I needed to hear I found a reason for me
6828067	6838135	It changed who I used to be A reason to start over new And the reason is you And the reason is you
6854150	6855691	I'm not a perfect person
6875477	6888524	I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know I found a reason for me To stay who I used to be
6902851	6903812	Thank you for watching!
6921285	6924386	All the girls there are swooning for
6946545	6947025	Islander.
6947105	6950186	You know, I know that was painful for a lot of people to listen to because it was painful for me to sing.
6950446	6950787	That's right.
6951047	6953607	Let's hear, let's go around and see what everybody thought of that.
6953647	6954108	Iguana Girl.
6955268	6956128	I still love you.
6956809	6957509	It's okay.
6957549	6958049	Yay.
6959389	6961590	It was, it was a little quiet, but I dug it.
6962370	6965312	I think, I think you would get girls throwing their panties at you any day.
6965632	6970533	So I give it, maybe tonight if you're lucky, I give it a seven.
6972834	6973174	Loki.
6973954	6975295	I give a little finger up to Robb.
6977341	6977862	That is it.
6978823	6979844	That wasn't painful.
6980744	6981946	Just give it a couple more minutes.
6984388	6985149	I fucking hate this.
6985369	6985789	Angel.
6986630	6987932	Hey, uh, that was really good.
6988412	6995139	Um, I'm gonna give it an 8 just cause I can, well, I don't have anything to say besides it was good.
6995679	6999203	Um, there was a couple parts that, you know,
7001217	7004620	All right.
7005160	7005861	All right, Loki.
7006361	7007842	What song is Loki going to sing?
7008062	7008723	No.
7009643	7009843	Huh?
7009924	7010404	Oh, I'm sorry.
7010424	7010744	I'm sorry.
7010784	7011204	Exquisite.
7011485	7012946	When he walked in, he was tardy.
7013066	7013506	What can you do?
7013706	7013926	I know.
7013986	7014447	I know.
7015127	7017169	Well, a mystic judge from Simon's view.
7019092	7021554	I don't wanna fuckin' play this!
7022174	7027177	Well, you did choke on some parts, but... Goddammit.
7027517	7028878	Give it a 7.5.
7028998	7029918	7.5, alright.
7030178	7030679	Alright!
7031359	7034781	Here comes Loki, and he's so excited to be performing for you guys tonight.
7036442	7037822	I'm gonna kill you in your sleep!
7040864	7041985	I'm so excited about this.
7042545	7045727	Well, let's see here, what's a shitty- This mic is, like, really bad.
7048760	7051421	This is the song I like, which I will not be singing it.
7052961	7054442	No, I will not be singing it.
7057502	7060983	I really wish that we had Snake Eater unlocked, because at least that song would be fun.
7080873	7082615	See, that's why I like you.
7082695	7084156	That's why I like you.
7084276	7086098	As he passes, oops, I did it again.
7086158	7090762	As the whole room cheers, I'm gonna fucking kill you.
7091543	7093244	Loki's gonna do oops, I did it again.
7093524	7094425	Come on.
7094465	7099690	Loki, Loki, Loki, Loki, Loki, Loki.
7106527	7109289	Oh, they do not feel bad.
7109309	7112110	They just wanted to hear the goddamn clip being played over and over again.
7112250	7114412	Listen, it wasn't funny the second time we tried it.
7114732	7117093	It's not going to be funny the third time.
7134672	7135072	Bye.
7135333	7136114	Test, test, test.
7136134	7137035	Fuck you.
7137055	7138496	Loki loves me.
7157409	7161550	We did get one, Loki sucks.
7161890	7163351	One person would comment since.
7166731	7169492	This goes out to Rob, and I fucking hate him.

7371164	7374106	You know, the listeners are going to vote this number one for a week on end.
7376095	7378898	Let's go around the room and see what everybody thought of that one, starting with the Guana Girl.
7379519	7380460	I thought it was fabulous.
7380920	7382922	Oh my god, I just can't believe it.
7383443	7383883	It's a 10.
7384905	7385365	It's a 10.
7386666	7387087	Islander.
7387547	7389349	It was so fabulous, I creamed my pants.
7391452	7391772	Angel.
7393314	7394375	Ew, it's so good.
7394415	7395676	Community value 10.
7396617	7397178	Exquisite.
7398068	7398989	He's dead.
7400150	7403652	I think he was one of those that got attacked with a butcher knife.
7404993	7406534	He's alive!
7407675	7411337	As for my thoughts... I think we're going to make a new record.
7412939	7414820	Number one billboard chart.
7415600	7418322	I give it a 10, and can I sleep over at your place tonight?

7435975	7440298	And we're going to do it again and again, if I'm still alive, after this break.
7440338	7441779	We'll be right back, boys and girls.
7441819	7443841	The FUs of the week are coming up pretty soon.
7444101	7445622	Although now I'm having second thoughts.

7723075	7724316	Orange Lounge Radio.
7724636	7726818	We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.
7734683	7736884	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
7738265	7742208	And it's time to reveal the winner of tonight's cage match.
7743348	7745490	And the winner of tonight's cage match is...
7746320	7748081	Loki with Oops I Did It Again.
7748702	7750483	Why are we not surprised?
7750503	7751144	Surprised, surprised.
7751164	7751624	You know what though?
7751944	7754586	The other two songs got a surprising amount of pity votes.
7754747	7756108	So I was very pleased.
7756148	7759410	So the effort did not go unappreciated by the rest of us.
7760171	7761632	We knew that Loki was going to cream us though.
7763413	7764214	Can I have a hug, Loki?
7764734	7765155	No.
7766976	7769698	He's taking off his aggressions on the Mario 64 right now.
7769778	7770359	So what can you do?
7771710	7773111	I know, like, what is that?
7773712	7776894	Why are you holding two DSs over there, Angel?
7779936	7780977	You guys are crazy.
7781618	7782058	Alright.
7783539	7786001	Congratulations, Loki, for winning tonight's cage match.
7787022	7792426	I thought it was funny because one person, when they voted, I was going through the votes, one person said, this is the only time you'll ever see me voting for Brittany.
7796769	7797410	I thought that was funny.
7797950	7798771	Alright, um...
7800471	7803012	We're going to do some winners for the MidiHead CDs.
7804212	7805733	So hurry up, last chance to get in.
7805773	7811574	Free stuff at OrangeOnTrader.com And also he said he was still taking some stuff on his site over at MidiHead.com too.
7811955	7816996	Yeah, just use the email little bubble on his site and there's a little submission form.
7818851	7819191	Very cool.
7819271	7822392	And we got that song that he wanted to play earlier.
7822652	7825393	It's actually, I believe it's an unreleased track, so I'm pretty excited.
7825413	7829654	We're going to be playing an unreleased track of his later, so very excited we're going to be hearing that.
7830154	7834115	In that break, before we came back, you heard some music from Parapara Paradise.
7834675	7835316	You know that game.
7835336	7836436	Whatever happened to that game?
7836476	7837676	Why did that game have to die?
7838697	7842938	It was one of those games that was cool when it first came out, and then it sucked, and then it was cool again.
7843058	7846959	What was cool about that game is that when we first played it, we had no idea what the hell Parapara was.
7847984	7851926	And then we learned, and then it just wasn't as cool as it was.
7853267	7853647	I don't know.
7858350	7859851	I don't know, it was like one of those things where it was like...
7861539	7865181	I think it was cool when people didn't know that you had to do line dances to it, basically.
7865221	7867943	And then when you found out you had to do the synchronized dance, it was kind of suck.
7868243	7870245	But some people really got into it, which is, you know, good for them.
7870625	7876028	And then when, you know, people just started to have fun with it and not take it so seriously, I think it was cool again.
7876108	7878390	So I can go back and listen to that music anytime now.
7878430	7881472	Like, there was a period there, though, where it was like, oh, para, para.
7882392	7882772	Oh, God.
7882893	7883673	Oh, you're a beat.
7883713	7886835	But no, I understand what you're saying about, like, going back and listening to the music.
7886895	7887115	Yeah.
7888176	7888256	Hmm.
7888860	7889501	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7910575	7916779	So, I noticed some folks in the chat room right now are talking about Disney's rave and some of the non-stops.
7916799	7921221	It was kind of making me think, how did everything go over for Thanksgiving with you guys' non-stop marathon?
7921501	7922222	Very, very well.
7922982	7926664	We had some large listener counts on both days.
7927385	7930066	I really hadn't anticipated on doing both days because I didn't, you know.
7930486	7935109	You know how you have your TBS version of A Christmas Story?
7935789	7938791	How they'll play it for like 24 hours straight and just...
7939151	7940613	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7956449	7961810	Not quite as many people on the Friday rebroadcast, but still very, very respectable.
7962451	7963651	A lot of people tuned in.
7963691	7964171	It was great.
7965231	7973994	And then, of course, we did the Orange Lounge Rewind directly after, so I'm hoping that we got some of those people to listen in, so we got you guys some more exposure, too.
7974114	7974454	Cool.
7974474	7975114	Thank you very much.
7975194	7975914	We appreciate the help.
7976374	7979195	And anything else exciting coming up on DDR Freak Radio in the near future?
7980155	7981096	Not at the present time.
7981116	7992520	I'm trying to work with one of the moderators on a side project, see if maybe we can get that kind of working, but I don't know when that's going to be coming up.
7992840	7993280	Okay.
7993340	7995721	I'm sure you guys will hear all about it by the time.
7996181	7996662	I'm sure we will.
7996682	7997442	It's ready.
7997542	7999723	And we should do something for the end of the year.
8000183	8000443	Yeah.
8000483	8001323	Think of something to do.
8001684	8001944	Yeah.
8002084	8002444	You can do it.
8002464	8002604	Yeah.
8002964	8003885	Countdown or something.
8003905	8004305	It'll be fun.
8004345	8004825	We could do that.
8004845	8005345	We could do that.
8005545	8006906	You're going to meet at my place anyway.
8007206	8007646	That's true.
8007666	8008567	That's true.
8008587	8009547	Live broadcast, maybe?
8009667	8009887	Maybe.
8010088	8010448	We'll see.
8010928	8015470	And also, I hear that there's a reunion show in the works for Under Sedation Live.
8015730	8016471	Yeah.
8016551	8018151	Got contacted about that one today.
8018191	8019132	That should be interesting.
8019512	8028738	For those who don't know, Iguana Girl and I used to be co-hosts on a show over on another station, Under Station Live, which is still going, by the way, still kicking, over on Live 365.
8029098	8031339	UnderStationLive.org is the site, if you want to check it out.
8031599	8034141	And there's going to be a reunion show coming up with Iguana Girl and myself.
8034181	8034821	That should be fun.
8034881	8037563	And I believe DarkSakura's going to be in on it, too, because she was a big part of it.
8037583	8038564	Yeah, she was a big part of it.
8038584	8041465	She was the most frequent... No, Islander or her.
8041966	8044627	Either her or Islander was the most frequent guest at the end of it.
8044747	8048530	Yeah, so it'll probably be a situation where we'll all just hang out and...
8049250	8055552	OneRoom, and then Skype with Travis Donovan over there and see if we can get it all working.
8055572	8055972	Very cool.
8055992	8057452	See if we can recapture the magic.
8057613	8057813	Yes.
8058553	8060233	Even though it'll kind of be virtual a little bit.
8060273	8060573	Yeah.
8061694	8065895	Travis won't be able to throw any of his figures at me, which will be kind of sad, but, you know, what can you do?
8065995	8067295	And I won't be able to see the white boy dance.
8067936	8068796	No white boy dance.
8068816	8069996	We'll have to get him a webcam or something.
8070616	8070856	Yeah.
8071137	8071457	All right.
8071577	8074318	No piles and piles of cigarette butts in the ashtray.
8076696	8082879	I kind of also brought up DDR Freak for a reason because I was kind of reading, you know, as a lot of people in the Bomani scene do, I was reading the message boards over there.
8083659	8087581	And a little bit of spatting going on in the Ultramix 2 thread right now.
8087601	8088401	A little bit of spatting.
8089147	8089387	Really?
8089407	8090268	I don't read that.
8090748	8094430	I know, but nothing that needs moderation going on or anything.
8094470	8100613	But just, you know, some people are a little upset with Ultramix 2, saying the timing is a big issue.
8100633	8103255	And they're saying, we need a patch for Ultramix 2.
8103995	8106577	Dear KCEH, patch Ultramix 2.
8106837	8110239	The timing is screwed up, and it's screwing up my PA.
8110339	8112460	Didn't they do this already before?
8112480	8114101	I don't know.
8114537	8115218	Probably.
8115238	8115538	Yeah.
8115978	8118240	Isn't this the same gripe that they've had?
8119081	8119681	It's interesting.
8119721	8125565	With every new mix that comes out, first bitch, the steps, second bitch, the timing, third bitch, the song list.
8125986	8126826	Nothing is enough.
8127187	8127927	Nothing is enough.
8129148	8129969	Drives me bonkers.
8129989	8130349	You know what?
8130389	8130649	Yeah.
8131710	8134652	The nice thing is that nobody was really bitching about the song list or the steps this time.
8134893	8135773	So I think the timing.
8135793	8136114	Well, no.
8136414	8137775	They have to bitch about something.
8138455	8143539	It would not be, you know, in a consumer-run society, they have to bitch about something.
8144740	8145660	Yes, exactly.
8146120	8147321	They have to bitch about something.
8147521	8149101	No matter what, they have to bitch about something.
8149161	8154443	So I guess, you know, we just have to kind of deal with it and kind of ignore the idiots as much as we can.
8155703	8158604	And, you know, I'm trying to look at both sides of it.
8158644	8160544	You know, I try to take, you know, perspective.
8160865	8163145	Okay, I got to see both sides of points of view here.
8163745	8166186	And, yeah, the timing window is a little different from the arcade.
8166626	8167606	But that's the thing.
8167746	8169187	Ultramix is not the arcade.
8169427	8169527	Yep.
8170000	8174420	and I think that's what a lot of people often forget is that DDR in the arcade right now here in the U.S.
8175089	8175849	is six feet under.
8176210	8180451	Now, is there a chance that it will rise from the grave and, you know... Lord, I hope so.
8180532	8182032	...kick some ass again in the arcade?
8182192	8182693	We hope so.
8182753	8183553	We really, really hope so.
8183993	8185974	But for now, you know, home version is what we got.
8186614	8187695	And I don't know.
8187735	8196759	I think the comparisons to Extreme and the other Japanese mixes are very interesting when you consider that they're not even really supposed to be here.
8197619	8198120	You know what I mean?
8198280	8198580	Yeah.
8198740	8200000	So, I don't know.
8201481	8203202	I can kind of see why...
8205298	8208599	There might be a difference, too, in the fact that you're dealing with completely different hardware.
8209180	8212301	And you're dealing with an engine that was probably written from the ground up.
8213061	8215022	It wasn't really written to emulate the arcade.
8215042	8216102	It was written to be something new.
8216222	8218523	And I think that's what a lot of people have grown to appreciate about Ultramix 2.
8219063	8219604	You know what I mean?
8219944	8221564	Where it's kind of like, it's supposed to be something new.
8222285	8223365	So it's not going to get it 100%.
8225166	8226546	But, I don't know.
8227607	8229727	Well, like I said, it's going to be something.
8229887	8231148	It's always going to be something.
8231927	8232547	No matter what.
8233488	8241352	And it's frustrating that people can't just appreciate the fact that we are getting these new mixes and that these are things that we...
8242840	8245222	How long ago weren't expecting to get any of?
8245803	8247484	I mean, what, less than two years ago?
8247504	8248065	Uh-huh.
8248245	8249526	We were having to import everything.
8249746	8250107	Uh-huh.
8250347	8259074	So, I personally, I'm just thankful the fact that we have these mixes and the fact that we're getting, that we have, you know, people that are interested enough in it to keep us going.
8259495	8264179	And I'm not going to say that people who are complaining about it are not thankful because chances are they are.
8264239	8265220	They probably love the game.
8265420	8265620	Yeah.
8265640	8266561	They just, you know, they want to find ways.
8266581	8268703	They're not expressing it and that's my concern.
8268743	8269984	They want to find ways to make it better.
8270564	8273767	Yeah, but there's ways to go about that.
8274828	8281634	And bitching on a message board, you know, namely DDR Freak, is not the way to go about doing so.
8282495	8285258	You know, write your complaints in a letter.
8286078	8288180	Send it to the appropriate parties.
8288220	8289782	Don't just bitch about it on a message board.
8290763	8290983	You know?
8292147	8292888	We don't need it.
8293028	8295669	We don't need the drama.
8295870	8297531	We got enough drama on our own.
8313663	8317489	OrangeLoungeRadio.com Era, End of the Century, La Señorita, Silent Hill, I Feel the Junk Circuit Mix
8328277	8330798	This is what... And a lot of people are saying it ain't worth it.
8330818	8332078	We've played these songs to death.
8332278	8333038	Then don't buy it.
8333178	8336739	But I'm seeing... And a lot of people are expressing they're not going to, which is, you know, fine.
8336779	8341880	But this is one of those things where I kind of see it's really Konami is in a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation.
8341920	8347321	Because when they don't give us these songs, people go, there's not enough of the Japanese mixes in the game.
8348621	8353802	So I'm kind of like... These songs here are like staple DDR songs.
8354082	8354242	Yep.
8354402	8356383	Have never been on the Xbox before.
8356483	8357823	So if you're not a PS2 owner...
8358743	8359683	This is a godsend.
8359724	8365026	Just like if you're not an Xbox owner, Festival is probably great for you.
8365066	8369368	Whereas a lot of people are hating on it because they're saying, it's just a copy of the Xbox version.
8369408	8376151	Well, yeah, but if I were living in Japan and I didn't import my games from the US, which I imagine not a lot of people do, I'd probably love it.
8377092	8377952	So, I don't know.
8379208	8383992	I think a lot of the people are just kind of taking it with a grain of salt at this point.
8384052	8387074	I mean, you can't take it personally.
8387594	8390777	You can't take a lot of the complaints to heart.
8390917	8391977	Oh yeah, oh yeah.
8392038	8394559	And I know most people at Konami probably don't.
8394579	8397361	And they probably do take each criticism.
8397401	8400243	They probably say, okay, maybe we should... Yeah, but after about the 15th...
8401263	8402223	Billionth Time.
8402603	8409286	Maybe in the next song pack, just two or three of these songs, and then two or three new songs, and maybe people will be happier.
8409426	8409846	I don't know.
8411766	8412107	I don't know.
8412487	8412887	I agree.
8413087	8415428	I think they're in a damn if you do, damn if you don't situation.
8415568	8417648	There's five more song packs to go, boys and girls.
8417888	8419349	I think the best is still yet to come.
8420009	8423190	I think one of the better song packs for Ultramix 1 was one of the later ones.
8423210	8424331	I want to say it was song pack 4?
8425831	8426732	was a really good one.
8428333	8430395	Honestly, hold on to your butts.
8430635	8431455	It's going to be a fun ride.
8431796	8441823	I think there's going to be better... I mean, I will probably buy this song pack anyway just so I can play these songs on Xbox Live because I would like to play Era on Xbox Live because I love TAC.
8442264	8450130	So, you know, that's enough to seal the deal for me right there is that we haven't had a lot of these songs in 60 frames a second and, you know, on Xbox Live before, so why not?
8450530	8453412	But if you're not going to buy it, then fine, I won't play you.
8455563	8455663	F.U.S.
8455683	8455943	of the Week
8484927	8485629	Oh, this is bad.
8485669	8486490	Here is justice.
8486911	8487912	Here is punishment.
8502597	8511332	On behalf of Jamie, I'll just enter in an F you to old people and drivers, stupid people, uneducated people.
8512534	8514678	What else does Jamie... Customers.
8514698	8515399	Customers.
8516080	8516521	Yeah, so...
8517583	8519863	I think I probably hit on something in there, I hope.
8519983	8520384	We'll see.
8520624	8521224	Hurricanes.
8521684	8522224	That too.
8522264	8522924	Light prices.
8523184	8524644	Maybe, you know what, maybe... Yeah, light prices.
8524664	8527385	She's probably pissed off at jet lag right now, being in Alabama.
8527885	8527985	Yeah.
8528045	8532026	So... And I'm sure she's missing us really badly.
8532546	8536566	She would give an F you to missing Skye and Loki and Iguana Girl and Islander and everybody here.
8538107	8539067	Yeah, anyway, let's move on.
8539347	8544988	Jimmy.
8545008	8545088	Um...
8546963	8551044	Fuck you to Mario 64 DS for being frustrating.
8551485	8554686	No wonder I didn't have the original game, it was too frustrating.
8554986	8562909	And I want to throw my DS, but then before I throw it, I realize how expensive it was, and then don't throw it, and continue to play the game and get frustrated even more.
8563989	8570911	Um, anyway, and also, fuck you to leaves, there's still tons of them outside, and they're still piled up next to my car.
8570951	8575173	Speaking of car, fuck you to my car, because it's broken in some way and I don't know why.
8575996	8583121	And the problem is, is I don't want to take another day off of work just to go down to the dealership and take my car down there so they can tell me that they don't know what's wrong with it.
8583141	8583961	But it's broken.
8584602	8594248	Anyways, um, so it still drives, and I don't think it's anything major, like maybe the alignment's off or, you know, the brakes are falling off or something, but other than that, you know, it's fine.
8594869	8602074	Um, then, uh, really, I don't know, fuck you for wasting this entire four-day weekend on Final Fantasy XI.
8603226	8604687	Because I really didn't do anything.
8604727	8606809	I didn't work on my cabinet, which I should have.
8606929	8611693	And I didn't, you know, clean house or, you know, God knows what else.
8611973	8613474	You know, visit family or something.
8614355	8615175	So that sucks.
8615616	8618218	And, um, what else?
8618438	8629847	Oh, just, um, fuck you to work because, you know, Movie Gallery is talking about buying Hollywood video and that means that there will be twice as many stupid people that I have to talk to every day.
8630547	8631328	So that sucks.
8634246	8636968	Oh wait, no!
8637409	8639311	Fuck you for Karaoke Revolution!
8639331	8644255	I don't know why I bought that game and wasted my money, but whatever.
8644355	8650801	Okay, I'm done.
8655085	8657007	I escaped the FUs, I was so happy.
8657027	8657507	Um...
8658678	8660779	I don't know, I'm actually not very angry this week.
8660819	8666642	I think F you to just the time really flying by these past four days and the realization that I gotta go back to work tomorrow.
8667442	8672625	Not that, I mean, I love my job, don't get me wrong, I absolutely adore my job, but you know, I adore sitting on my ass even more.
8673385	8676707	Really is what it boils down to, so I can't, you know.
8677467	8681729	F you to Halo 2 and getting killed by 13 year olds and then being made fun of by them.
8682284	8683645	Thank you for watching!
8697250	8703212	and FU to Sigurd, because he said that he would only be able to battle me on controller tonight on Xbox Live.
8703232	8706633	So we're going to have to postpone the battle until later anyway, because we're running out of time.
8707073	8712555	And we did, the karaoke thing kind of bumped him, which I'm sure he's pleased about, and he'll probably give me an FU about that later, but we'll see.
8713195	8716356	And, um, otherwise, I think I'm okay.
8716776	8717957	I've had a pretty good weekend.
8718177	8722038	I have a lot to be thankful for this Thanksgiving season, and, um...
8723200	8723700	Oh, I know.
8724121	8733085	F you to whoever decided... My really, really good friend Christopher was in the hospital for his appendix, to have his appendix taken out.
8733826	8739488	F you to whoever decided to play a cruel joke on him and make him go back to have his gallbladder taken out two days later.
8741149	8741770	That sucks.
8742270	8743531	Feel better soon, Christopher.
8743591	8744091	We miss you.
8745114	8749398	And fuck you, Comedy Central, for not having a new episode drawn together on this week.
8749438	8753381	I have to wait fucking another week for a brand new episode, and that pisses me off.
8754302	8759566	But thank you for airing two nights in a row, South Park, bigger, longer, and uncut.
8760627	8764250	And thank you for steering my FUs in a completely different direction.
8764691	8766392	Let's move on to Iguana Girl.
8766432	8767233	She's got a microphone.
8768934	8771296	I have a microphone, and I'm not afraid to use it.
8771316	8771357	Um...
8772819	8789479	Big huge F you to my car for having this really weird really screwed up like brake problem that is inconsistent and only happens when it's not raining and now I also screw my car because it uh
8790034	8794019	Decided to start making a squealing noise whenever I make a hard turn left, also.
8794420	8808818	So, uh, yeah, so, uh, this is, like, multiple issues that the people over at Pet Boys could not figure out, and now I have to take it to the dealership to have them look at it and tell me that, you know, I need to spend, like, a thousand dollars to get it fixed or something like that.
8810626	8818954	and big huge fuck you to the fact that I actually had to work on Friday while all of you guys were being lazy asses and had Friday off.
8819154	8819535	Yay!
8822822	8826465	Yes, being in retail-ish stuff sucks.
8828566	8832850	And a big huge FU to still having like two weeks left of school.
8832950	8835812	And a big huge FU to having to study for finals soon.
8836873	8839615	And that's about it.
8840856	8842577	Alright, let's move on to Islander.
8843518	8845139	Oh yeah, I've got a big FU.
8845940	8849722	To the state of California for sending me a jury duty notice.
8851045	8858068	I faxed in the stuff that I needed to fax in saying I cannot take time off from work, yada yada.
8858568	8860149	I never got a response.
8860229	8860969	How lovely!
8862690	8864350	Be glad you're not on the Peterson jury.
8865111	8865391	Really.
8866111	8868952	So, unfortunately, tomorrow is supposed to be my day off.
8869772	8874954	I have to, unfortunately, go down to the courthouse and see if I get picked to serve in a jury.
8876255	8877275	Oh, no, no, no.
8877716	8878216	In my LJ...
8879110	8886875	Good buddy of mine, Jabberwocky, suggested walking into the courthouse with a copy of the Weekly World News to show how unintelligent I am, and I think I'll do that.
8888176	8888697	Fabulous.
8889297	8899084	Second FU is actually also to the state of California for a late payment on my car insurance, and they want to suspend my license.
8901417	8902678	Big huge long story behind that.
8902698	8903979	We're not going to get into that.
8904079	8906841	Yeah, long story short, he's got to do that tomorrow too.
8907261	8911364	And so I've got a really long day with this data, and I really don't like this data at this point.
8913645	8923412	But other than that, and also, as I want to go mention, as you do working on Friday, that sucks, but hey, I need the money.
8926614	8928355	And yep, that's about it.
8928375	8931057	All right, let's move on to DDR Angel.
8934057	8934237	Addict.
8934838	8937920	Tell him I got my first summon today and I'm very excited.
8937960	8938460	My summoner is level 20.
8938560	8938801	Addict.
8964534	8975142	and F you to the party in FF11 that I was in the other day because I said I had to go and deal with real life issues and they said, what's real life?
8976063	8980386	And I'm like, okay, bye-bye, bye-bye now, bye-bye.
8981146	8989933	So just F you to that because you guys are probably 13 and don't know any better and don't have a life like the rest of us that have to get away and real life comes first.
8991744	8996085	I thought I saw something on LiveJournal.
9021417	9022858	Oh, okay.
9023098	9024379	We'll take that discussion offline.
9024419	9025560	Meanwhile, explicit.
9028743	9041052	Grab the mic by the bottom because the cord's coming out a little bit and it's making a... Yeah, there, try that.
9041852	9042193	Talk now.
9044114	9047637	Okay, it's still cutting out.
9047657	9048958	Can we get him that other microphone real quick?
9049098	9050719	Sorry, bud, I don't know what's going on with that.
9053052	9053693	Go ahead.
9054293	9056115	Now that one's really loud, so keep it away.
9056135	9056395	Alright.
9056555	9056855	Okay.
9057496	9072608	I'd like to say an F you to some asshole who opened a door off of a supermarket, opened the door, slams my car, leaves a big mark, but luckily I have his license plate number so I can go to the department and sue his ass.
9074510	9077772	If you're a webcam, I want to give him the middle finger.
9079093	9079313	Okay.
9079333	9079834	Middle finger.
9081716	9100355	F you for the turkey for being so dry I think the turkey would say F you I'm dead F you for Fries for having a very fucking long line
9102214	9103775	I completely forgot about that.
9104556	9109279	Yeah, Fry's, so I get there, I go shopping on Black Friday, for God knows what reason.
9109740	9114783	I just decided, gee, you know, I don't think I've been fucked up the ass enough this week, let's go to Fry's.
9115244	9119227	So I go to Fry's, and their line wraps around the whole fucking store.
9119507	9121248	It's just... forever.
9121669	9125471	I, like, walk in line, I'm like, I'm all, damn, this line keeps going.
9125591	9130235	Keep walking, keep walking, keep walking, see far off in the distance, in the horizon...
9130783	9133005	A woman with balloons that says, end of line.
9133045	9135166	I'm like, ah, fuck it.
9135466	9137267	So then I had to make a judgment decision.
9137788	9141110	Do I want to buy the stuff that I couldn't find anywhere else?
9141310	9142451	Or run out the door.
9142531	9142991	Or leave.
9143692	9146293	Oh, wait, if I leave, I have to wait in line to get out of the store.
9146373	9148235	So, yeah, it fucking sucks.
9148295	9148715	Yeah.
9148775	9149035	Anyway.
9149115	9155059	Everything what Loki said, except that the register saying, sorry, we closed the line.
9155139	9155459	Thank you.
9155620	9155980	Bye-bye.
9157455	9161276	Just what I was about to buy in my $30, 512 megabyte RAM.
9163377	9163937	I need RAM.
9164817	9169839	Now I have to spend $90 or $120 just for it now, because it was a big ass sale at the time.
9171059	9172760	There goes one-fourth of the damn price.
9174020	9177862	And I have to get to Texas Hold'em for giving me some very, very shitty cards.
9178602	9178722	How...
9179830	9181971	Fuck you!
9182212	9184653	Islander pulled out the Texas Hold'em poker set.
9185033	9188395	Texas Hold'em Sacramento chapter is coming soon from what I hear.
9188755	9190116	No, it's more like Texas Fuck'em.
9193218	9195460	How the hell can you win with three and two?
9196060	9197181	That's nearly impossible.
9199142	9199462	No.
9200122	9203104	Alright.
9203384	9204285	Three hour show.
9204325	9205265	Three hour show, guys.
9205305	9205986	Wrap it up.
9208416	9212379	and NFU4 losing my very rare European watch.
9212899	9214520	It's now gone, I don't wear it anymore.
9214540	9222305	NFU4 worked for miscalculating my hours and money I've actually earned the whole two weeks.
9223486	9227248	Damn it, I know I have $100 missing.
9228389	9229750	I'm like, what the fuck?
9230670	9233112	I'm not going to come around getting slave labor now.
9234152	9234533	Shit.
9237174	9242358	and F you to the family for making the whole Thanksgiving all anti-American.
9245039	9246840	How do you make Thanksgiving anti-American?
9247761	9249302	The only American food was turkey.
9252504	9255526	I thought you meant like they were burning flags in the front yard or something.
9260816	9262397	Storytime, Islanders laughing.
9262577	9262917	What's up?
9262977	9263457	Storytime.
9266579	9267499	I'm stopping the music.
9267559	9269120	I can't take Captain Jack anymore.
9269140	9269540	I'm sorry.
9270381	9273302	We're at Ross's sister's house.
9273742	9279585	And she's talking about how she was talking to this friend of hers, this co-worker of hers.
9279645	9282467	And she's like, oh, well, I don't know how to make green bean casserole.
9282887	9283567	Oh, wait, no.
9283927	9286989	My little brother's girlfriend is going to be there.
9287289	9287889	She's white.
9287949	9288990	She'll know how to make it.
9294031	9298052	Since when is it a requirement of white people to know how to make green bean casserole?
9298553	9299153	I'm scared.
9299333	9302974	Does that mean I have to be deported because I don't know how to make, you know, casserole?
9303434	9305195	I eat black!
9305355	9305955	Wow!
9308196	9310217	I can make me some collard greens!
9310557	9311937	I can make hot pockets.
9312177	9313858	Does that count for anything?
9313898	9315218	Mac and cheese?
9316399	9317039	A hot pocket?
9318840	9321261	I eat a lot of pork and I like fried chicken.
9321321	9322261	Is that, you know...
9323812	9324473	Can I join the club?
9325613	9326413	Anyway, explicit.
9326914	9327534	Finish up your thought.
9327554	9328895	We gotta get to the chatroom FUs.
9330115	9335838	FU for people complaining about Ultramix 2 and yadda yadda butt stabs and such, such, such, such.
9336318	9342140	If you don't like those stabs, you can either edit the stabs by yourself, buy a memory card, or buy an Xbox edit.
9343041	9345602	I'm assuming that Ultramix 2 has edits to make, right?
9346602	9346782	Yes.
9347123	9347463	Okay.
9347983	9350064	Or you can go to Stumbadia and make your own shit.
9350939	9351680	Plain and simple.
9351840	9353402	I'm sure Konami loves hearing that.
9353502	9353802	All right.
9354623	9354883	All right.
9355223	9356184	We got to go to the chat room.
9356264	9356405	Okay.
9356425	9357145	To be continued.
9357165	9357486	All right.
9357846	9358366	As usual.
9358427	9358747	Goody, goody.
9358787	9359107	All right.
9359127	9359988	Let's bring the music back.
9363071	9364613	This is good chat room FU music.
9367816	9369297	All right.
9370779	9372340	Misty says two words.
9372901	9373662	Fuck fleeting.
9376525	9377125	Panda.
9378146	9379446	Amen.
9379466	9383346	A-freaking-men.
9383486	9386547	All the guys in the room just had the worst reaction to that.
9386567	9387747	That was amazing.
9389307	9393188	Panda just said, F you to Comcast for not working most of the time.
9393648	9396949	F you to my mom's friend for what I think is more than just a friend.
9397329	9398269	And F you to life.
9400509	9404150	Snowcat says, F you to broken teeth and having to go to the dentist in the morning.
9404210	9404450	Cry.
9405106	9405386	Yuck.
9406667	9412770	MPQ says, fuck Tekken 5 for being more important to local arcade goers than 2DX.
9413971	9414671	Well, it is pretty.
9415812	9416732	Pretty, but that's about it.
9417473	9425157	Illusion says, F you to my brother being a greedy bastard and not letting me use his Xbox to play Ultramix 2 more than a few days in a row.
9426217	9427738	Because you need to fix every day.
9427758	9428778	It's like heroin.
9428838	9429659	It's like heroin.
9430900	9431720	Tap the vein, baby.
9432722	9438384	Elmullet says F you in general to morons who complain about Ultramix 2 for the most asinine reasons.
9438885	9440685	Shut up about the timing windows, guys.
9440865	9441566	They don't matter.
9441686	9443206	Just pick a song and have fun.
9443787	9444187	Yeesh.
9445467	9446788	And I quote, yeesh.
9451719	9454600	Anyway, sorry.
9454920	9458581	Jaded2004 says, F you to Loki for singing Britney Spears.
9461441	9463402	Don't you be giving me the F you.
9463522	9464262	Blame Rob.
9464322	9467003	They're the ones that said, sing Britney Spears.
9467223	9468823	I didn't even want to play the game, okay?
9470604	9471124	Love you, Loki.
9472104	9476045	Jaded2004 also says, F you Michigan for having winters too cold.
9477176	9482397	Legend of Zaku says, F you to Chartwells, the food supplier for my campus, for making me gain 20 pounds.
9482677	9484738	Yeah, because they forced you to eat all that food.
9486138	9486858	They forced you.
9487238	9487618	Freshman 15.
9487778	9490959	F you to my, or in my case, freshman 30.
9491019	9496981	F you to my campus for giving me a shitty apartment that leaks water from the ceilings when it rains heavily.
9497021	9498061	Now there we go, that's valid.
9499077	9502599	F you to having to give up my PlayStation so that it can be sent to Peru.
9503219	9509082	And F you to my shitty stamina contributed to my weight problem for giving me more greats and not enough perfects.
9509142	9509782	I hear you on that one.
9511483	9515065	MJB says my F you of the week goes to my goddamn hair cutress.
9515903	9524767	I've never heard a haircutress who cut my hair extremely short after I repeatedly told her to only trim it and not to cut it very much.
9524807	9525727	You goddamn bitch.
9525807	9527608	My friends don't even recognize me anymore.
9527668	9528628	My hair is so short.
9528968	9532630	I hope you collapse, you stupid bitch.
9535051	9540213	Ziz says F you to Konami for making Ultramix 2's doubles sucks.
9541133	9542054	Suck, not sucks.
9543391	9549956	I changed my FU to FU to everyone at 8 on the break for being better than me and doing better in the tournament.
9550276	9551337	Being better in the group.
9552358	9556401	Don't send me a message that says I changed my FU because it doesn't work.
9556461	9557542	Because I read from the top down.
9557562	9560044	So you think before you hit that enter key, boys and girls.
9561825	9567230	DJ Ranma S says I only got two lines of his.
9567290	9571513	Something about having the cash to pay for that damn cubic zirconia engagement ring.
9573988	9574708	That's all I got.
9576629	9581011	Flareone says, F you to Konami of Hawaii's obsession with the dancing character Lady.
9583772	9585072	Where is slutty Emi?
9585192	9586113	That's what I want to know.
9588914	9591615	DidiArcoholic says, F you for not having FUs.
9591855	9593296	F you to Loki for yelling at me.
9593856	9596057	F you to not having enough time to come down to the show with you guys.
9596457	9599078	And F you to Loki for yelling at me for actually having FUs.
9600965	9604731	and JazzSaysFUtoWindowsServicePack2 for eating my windows.
9611314	9617739	Alright, Ranma S got cut off, so I feel bad for him, but he might send it in, and then we'll figure that out.
9617819	9619560	He says he's going to resend, so we'll see.
9620141	9622062	If it's too long, though, I'm cutting it short.
9622562	9627706	Alright, we're going to go to a break, and when we come back, let's give away some MIDI Head CDs, and play some MIDI Head songs as well.
9627786	9629147	I think that sounds like a plan.
9629367	9629688	Yay!
9630568	9634211	So let's play some stuff from, I don't know, what sounds good to you guys?
9634251	9636513	How about some poppin'?
9636533	9637574	Yay!
9638534	9639375	Let's do some poppin'.

9884452	9889093	So it's all down to Iguana Girl and Islander, our buddies from DDR Freak.
9889113	9891834	They're going to be picking the winners inadvertently in their own little way.
9892234	9896116	I just need you on that little slip of paper to write a number between one and this many.
9898997	9900897	Okay, write a number between one and that many.
9903118	9903458	All right.
9905179	9908662	And we're going to find out who won some free stuff.
9911825	9912406	Alright, you guys ready?
9912446	9913847	I hope you guys didn't put down the same number.
9914307	9914688	Okay, good.
9915228	9917170	Alright, Iguana Girl, what number did you put?
9917550	9918751	Number seven.
9918791	9919412	Let's see.
9919552	9922115	One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
9922195	9925518	Looks like Rychan won our first CD.
9925558	9926859	He's going to win a free MIDI head CD.
9926899	9927560	Good job, Rychan.
9927580	9928340	We'll be contacting you.
9928781	9930302	And Islander, what's your number?
9931043	9931263	Six.
9932166	9936250	All right, we're going to give that one to Legend of Zaku on that one.
9936330	9937211	So good job, guys.
9937732	9938592	Congratulations.
9939493	9940975	More free stuff in the future.
9941035	9950664	Again, if you want to try and get some stuff from Midihead's site, you can always visit his site, www.midihead.com, and he's doing some download stuff.
9950704	9951525	So go beg.
9951665	9955709	Go beg and plead and just prod around the site.
9957062	9958003	Alright, good job you guys.
9958083	9962687	They're celebrating in chat right now.
9962727	9963767	I'll be contacting you guys.
9963847	9964828	Don't call us, we'll call you.
9964928	9968291	But I do need to get your addresses in a little bit, so we'll be contacting you shortly.
9969272	9969652	Alright.
9972054	9972454	Let's see.
9972554	9974436	How about some Ask Orange Lounge, you guys?
9975458	9976178	We've got a little time here.
9976198	9977799	We're going to open up the Skype line as well.
9977819	9982660	If you guys want to call in over on www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on Interact With Us.
9982700	9988102	But first, I have to get some FUs of the Week in, some that got forgotten there.
9988182	9993004	Sigurd tried to send me an FU of the Week three times, and I don't know why, but it's broken.
9993064	9993724	It didn't work right.
9994084	9996645	So it's broken.
9997025	10002187	But he had some choice words for some of the people complaining about the game he worked on.
10003208	10004308	So let's just leave it at that.
10005942	10009423	I told him I would call him, but he doesn't want to.
10009924	10010364	He's shy.
10011344	10012745	But DJ Ranma S had another one.
10012785	10016366	He said, a giant F you to that stupid bitch that whined about the Black Friday sale.
10016446	10018507	Another F you to the lady who called me lazy.
10018827	10020928	That's why I flipped you off in front of everyone there.
10021308	10024229	And finally, a giant F you to my former roommate for getting married.
10024289	10030491	By the time I'm done with suing your ass for throwing my shit out, you won't have the cash to pay for that damn cubic zirconia engagement ring.
10030952	10032172	Oh, okay, there we go.
10032212	10033112	Okay, that was a ring.
10033853	10034533	That makes sense.
10036211	10037132	Alright, good deal.
10037972	10045737	Okay, so if you guys have a question for Ask Orange Lounge, you can just send that on in over private message to Sky right now.
10045777	10047898	Let me just type that in chat there.
10047958	10052641	Or can you tell them how to send me a message, if you wouldn't mind?
10052861	10053561	In case they don't know.
10054382	10056683	Meanwhile, we've got the theme music we've got to do here.
10058083	10063227	And we're also going to take calls over Skype for this as well, if you guys want to call in our Skype line there.
10063928	10064588	Type, type, type.
10074949	10077892	Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.
10078412	10081635	What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?
10082195	10085378	One question I'd like to know is why is Loki so bitter?
10085778	10089021	He threw a fit and now I'm afraid he's going to kill me in my sleep.
10095487	10095967	All right.
10097850	10103134	First question for Ask Orange Lounge is, actually we don't have any yet because there's a delay.
10103575	10105516	And I forgot to announce this before the previous break.
10105536	10107578	So we don't have any questions over private message just yet.
10107958	10111301	So I was going to open it up if anybody else had any questions for anyone else.
10114123	10114523	Anything?
10114823	10115164	Anything?
10115484	10117145	They're too busy playing DS.
10118766	10120528	DDR Angel, I have a question for you then.
10121548	10125531	Why the F did you come over here if you're just going to play DS all night?
10127173	10129555	I'm fully paying attention, Mr. Man.
10129655	10130155	I'm just teasing.
10130195	10132117	I'm giving you a hard time.
10132377	10132917	Where have you been?
10132957	10134239	Just busy with school and stuff?
10134439	10140744	Busy with school and couldn't get rides and stuff, so, you know, stuff happens.
10141705	10149311	But I'm here this week, and hopefully I can come the next couple weeks, and it'll be just like old times.
10150256	10150877	Sounds good to me.
10150937	10153338	Alright, now we're getting some questions from chat.
10154359	10157902	MPQ wants to know, why does Bomani suck so much in this state?
10158782	10161744	I don't know what state he lives in, so it's a little hard for me to comment.
10162865	10170551	I could assume he lives in, I don't know... I guess, or... Because I don't read minds, unfortunately.
10170651	10173313	I mean, I could guess, but I think he said he was on the East Coast.
10173333	10174834	Because your state has it out for you.
10177346	10178326	Oh, he says Washington.
10178406	10184248	Isn't Washington where GameWorks is and all the Seattle people that have a lot of good stuff up there?
10185248	10186309	Maybe he doesn't live near there.
10186349	10186729	I don't know.
10187069	10189730	Well, here's the blanket answer for that question.
10189770	10194011	If you think the state of Bomani sucks in your state, buy the home mixes.
10194431	10195171	There's one option.
10195411	10198432	They put those out for a reason so you can play in the comfort of your own home.
10198452	10204774	If you still don't like it, get some of your friends together, professionally approach the management at your local arcade and say, hey,
10205294	10212944	We've got an idea for a game that would bring you guys money and emphasize money and visiting frequently.
10213345	10216989	So if you don't like the situation, you can take control in your own hands and do something about it.
10217871	10219393	So just a thought for you guys.
10221756	10222016	All right.
10222401	10225082	Dark Knight says, what are your guys' Christmas wishes this year?
10249749	10251210	Anybody care to answer a Christmas wish?
10251610	10253271	I wish for world peace.
10254612	10255593	I need new clothes.
10255753	10256513	I want to get laid.
10257094	10257514	Just kidding.
10258815	10266219	No, my Christmas wish is just, I would like to just have enough time to hang out with all my friends.
10266259	10267200	I want a lot of parties.
10267300	10268580	I want a lot of holiday parties.
10268660	10269841	That's my Christmas wish.
10269961	10270842	I want holiday parties.
10271522	10273883	And that can be Christmas, New Year's, and year-round, really.
10273924	10274944	Just throw parties all year-round.
10275645	10276045	That's great.
10276365	10278126	Angel, did you have something you wanted to add to that, your Christmas wish?
10278956	10279496	I got mine.
10281237	10281677	Oh, what's that?
10281697	10295842	Uh, DS, but, uh, I already got it, and, well, I don't really know what I want besides, uh, the Karaoke Revolution 2 and 3, which I haven't gotten yet, and, uh, Ultra Mix 2.
10297863	10302485	Uh, the rest has to come later, because it's more expensive, like, uh, Ace Style and, uh, 10th
10304926	10306628	I do really want 8th style and poppin' 10.
10306688	10307789	It's just going to be a little while there.
10308789	10309230	What can you do?
10310270	10312532	Anybody else want to share anything they want for Christmas this year?
10313433	10314554	I need clothes.
10315555	10318657	Yes, certificates to any store would be nice, like Target.
10322280	10322660	Exquisite.
10323481	10324502	Anything priceless.
10325642	10326984	Another bumper for my car.
10327864	10328385	Ha ha ha ha!
10330334	10334538	I would like lessons for all those who can't drive.
10334698	10337420	That is my Christmas wish.
10339221	10341123	Alright, we have a question from Illusion.
10341843	10342624	This is great.
10343284	10343945	Listen to this one.
10344685	10348708	How do you deal with Sigurd's sweet ass anytime he comes on?
10349489	10351451	Is it hard keeping your hands off of it?
10353712	10354133	Wow.
10355534	10356054	You know what?
10356094	10357075	Sigurd's just a friend.
10358729	10360650	You know he's just a friend.
10361010	10367172	Oh, baby, you got what I need.
10368293	10371013	Would you want to grab your brother's sweet ass?
10371374	10372194	No.
10372334	10374455	You may if you live in Alabama.
10375235	10378536	I don't have these sweet ass feelings towards Sigurd.
10378916	10380837	Do you have sweet ass Sigurd feelings, one girl?
10381725	10382746	I don't, I'm sorry.
10383327	10386589	I know that's going to be heartbreaking for him, but I don't.
10387410	10387770	Islander?
10387950	10388411	Never have.
10389111	10391093	Loki, how do you resist Sigurd's sweet ass?
10392074	10393235	Quite easily, I'm straight.
10397819	10398699	Alright, moving on.
10400000	10403843	DJ Ranma S says, do you guys want a holiday card for me?
10404604	10404824	Yes.
10405885	10407166	Certainly, of course we want a holiday.
10407206	10408187	We'll put it up on our wall.
10408427	10409228	We have a little wall here.
10409921	10411482	Legend of Zaku says, you're on that DDR diet, right?
10411502	10412983	Legend of Zaku says, you're on that DDR diet, right?
10439907	10446412	I need help planning a regimen for dropping 20 pounds, aka what songs and or Oni courses must I do to really start shedding weight?
10447344	10448685	Okay, here's my honest answer to the question.
10448705	10451446	There's really no set songs or choruses to do.
10451506	10453347	There's no, like, super weight loss plan.
10453687	10456549	My suggestion is if you're going to play non-stops, play the long ones.
10456669	10461031	Play 7 to 10, because the more you take breaks in between songs, the less your cardio is going to go.
10461331	10462912	Yeah, the main thing is cardio.
10462972	10467094	You want to focus on doing at least a good 20 minutes of non-stop cardio.
10467454	10471937	Even if that means doing something as simple as just, you know, a basic endless.
10472217	10474358	You know, even then you're going to be burning calories.
10474978	10475598	Thanks for watching!
10495583	10496004	DarkSakura.com
10513113	10516035	That would be my suggestion if you really want more exercise.
10516055	10520437	Because DDR, it gives you a really good workout, but, you know, I think you can enhance it.
10520457	10522278	You can make it better by doing other little things, too.
10522298	10526940	Buy, like, a little set of those mini five-pound hand weights or something like that.
10527340	10527660	Absolutely.
10527700	10528501	And work out with those.
10529641	10531542	All right.
10531862	10533603	Yeah.
10533623	10536144	To be honest, I was going to say, if you have a Max 3, I'll play Pop 8.
10537125	10541367	Dojo Max says, when will DDR Max 3 come out?
10542111	10544531	I heard Naoki is producing it in a secret basement.
10544611	10545172	Is this true?
10547112	10548592	Chances are, no, that's not true.
10548792	10553353	We would probably... Don't believe anything unless we report it.
10553433	10553533	No.
10554073	10558934	Unless Konami's official site says something, there's really nothing you can do.
10559634	10560494	It's all speculation.
10560854	10564255	And I do think if a new DDR at this point comes out, it's not going to be called Max 3.
10564775	10565775	It will be called something else.
10566115	10567656	Because Max 3 was extreme.
10567956	10569436	I don't know if you missed DDR Extreme, but...
10570546	10573848	I think if they do do a new DDR, honestly, here's my suggestion.
10575148	10577009	Konami, if you're listening, feel free to take this.
10578270	10581511	If you're going to do a new DDR, you're going to do a new hardware thing, right?
10581591	10586133	And you're probably going to spice it up a little bit, make it a little more like 2DX, like bigger, badder, better thing, right?
10586413	10587454	Here's my suggestion.
10588014	10589374	Dance Dance Revolution 2.
10595297	10596137	It's as simple as that.
10596657	10597718	Wow, interesting name.
10598991	10601712	Just Dance Dance Revolution 2.
10601812	10604874	Question on behalf of Dark Child through DDArcoholic.
10605194	10606675	And this will be the last question for tonight, you guys.
10607015	10610457	If Dark Child was gay, would Sky sleep with him?
10612878	10613118	No.
10613779	10616420	Alright, that's going to do it for Ask Orange Lounge tonight.
10616460	10620182	Thank you guys very much for your questions tonight and participating.
10621010	10626235	Now we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought, but not before we get in a plug for the rest of the week's programming.
10626576	10631681	Monday night, tune in to Diversion, the Orange Lounge Radio remix show, right here on Orange Lounge Radio.
10631721	10637006	All your favorite Bomani remixes, official, fan-made ones, and yes, remixes done in Acid are okay.
10637227	10638027	Yay!
10638087	10639469	Tuesday night, Dark Sakura.
10639489	10644354	I do believe she's back this Tuesday, and she's going to be doing... She's not going to be back until way late, though.
10644574	10648557	So, there'll be a rerun of Pump Up the Volume, ready to go.
10648677	10650678	So, likely we're going to get a rerun of Pump Up the Volume.
10650698	10656383	But it's a good show, and you should tune in, you know, and check out what it's all about if you haven't listened before, because it'll be new to you.
10656803	10659425	So, Tuesday nights, about 7.30, Pump Up the Volume.
10660265	10663628	Thursday nights, I'm sorry, Wednesday nights are the classic episodes of Orange Lingerie.
10663648	10673455	Thursday nights, myself, Rice Princess, and LikeyStyle, we're back from our Thanksgiving holiday this week with Outside the Box, all that other video gaming chat that doesn't quite fit into the Bomani Spectrum.
10674096	10679318	and then Friday night over on the Freak or DDR Freak Radio Orange Lounge Radio Rewind.
10679738	10683639	Hear the same shit over again but it's just as good the second time you guys.
10684439	10685740	Especially when you missed some of it.
10685800	10687020	That filling tastes great.
10687160	10687300	Yep.
10688160	10692822	Alright, so that's it for the programming and now we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought.
10692862	10694862	We'll start with Islander because he has a microphone over there.
10697663	10698463	Final thoughts.
10699784	10701024	Quit your bitching and just accept it.
10702845	10703165	Thank you.
10703365	10703865	Very stern.
10705442	10706323	Angel, your final thought.
10708365	10709526	Mario sucks.
10710166	10710727	No, just kidding.
10711728	10713289	Aguana Girl, your final thought.
