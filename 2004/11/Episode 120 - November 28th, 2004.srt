[SPEAKER_03]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio episode number 120 in progress and our friends over at Step Squad

66
00:10:02,179 --> 00:10:03,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Sending us that little shout out there.

67
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,182
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay, Step Squad!

68
00:10:05,202 --> 00:10:06,743
[SPEAKER_03]: That shout out's about two years old.

69
00:10:06,783 --> 00:10:07,564
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to get a new one.

70
00:10:07,644 --> 00:10:10,326
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to get a new Step Squad family gathering.

71
00:10:10,946 --> 00:10:12,748
[SPEAKER_03]: And what is Step Squad for those not in the know?

72
00:10:12,768 --> 00:10:14,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I know you're a member of Step Squad.

73
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:21,936
[SPEAKER_08]: Step Squad, it actually isn't really technically a DDR team per se, but it is at the same time.

74
00:10:22,316 --> 00:10:28,681
[SPEAKER_08]: It's more of a friends that were brought together by things like the Mani and Anime.

75
00:10:28,741 --> 00:10:30,323
[SPEAKER_08]: It just has a very DDR tone.

76
00:10:30,803 --> 00:10:34,645
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not one of those, like, teams, oh my god, it's LOL, gonna kick your butt, let's have a battle.

77
00:10:34,665 --> 00:10:47,530
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah, no, it's not all about, oh my god, we have to win over you, no, it's, you know, of course we take pride in our wins, but it's not all DDR to us, it's more about family than anything.

78
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:48,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool, very cool.

79
00:10:49,011 --> 00:10:52,513
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, welcome everybody to Orange Lounge Radio for those joining us for the very first time.

80
00:10:52,553 --> 00:10:53,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the program.

81
00:10:54,034 --> 00:10:59,458
[SPEAKER_03]: We are a program dedicated to all things Bomani and then some for those of you that don't know what Bomani is.

82
00:10:59,538 --> 00:11:02,680
[SPEAKER_03]: That is the music gaming fusion series put out by Konami.

83
00:11:03,001 --> 00:11:08,184
[SPEAKER_03]: So, of course, we talk a lot about other types of video games and other types of music and any randomness that we feel like.

84
00:11:08,284 --> 00:11:15,669
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know we got some new folks listening tonight, especially with the syndications happening over on DDR Freak Radio, which Iguana Girl's been helping out with on Friday nights.

85
00:11:15,869 --> 00:11:16,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

86
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,531
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate that.

87
00:11:17,951 --> 00:11:19,813
[SPEAKER_03]: 6 o'clock over on DDR Freak Radio on Friday nights.

88
00:11:20,154 --> 00:11:21,555
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know we're getting some new people from that.

89
00:11:21,635 --> 00:11:25,059
[SPEAKER_03]: So thanks a lot, you guys, for tuning in and helping to support Orange Lounge Radio.

90
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:26,060
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hope you enjoy the program.

91
00:11:26,661 --> 00:11:27,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we're a little weird sometimes.

92
00:11:28,402 --> 00:11:28,703
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello?

93
00:11:28,943 --> 00:11:29,644
[SPEAKER_03]: A little weird.

94
00:11:30,224 --> 00:11:30,485
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

95
00:11:31,121 --> 00:11:32,161
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

96
00:11:56,528 --> 00:11:57,429
[SPEAKER_03]: I am the Jamie.

97
00:11:57,889 --> 00:11:59,690
[SPEAKER_03]: Does she know that you're sitting in her chair?

98
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:00,531
[SPEAKER_08]: No, not at all.

99
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,913
[SPEAKER_03]: And burping out... And burping in her honor.

100
00:12:04,918 --> 00:12:06,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Aguana Girl, how was your week?

101
00:12:29,411 --> 00:12:34,255
[SPEAKER_08]: No, mine, I still haven't taken it in, because I thought I figured out what the problem was.

102
00:12:56,779 --> 00:12:58,060
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what it is.

103
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Whenever I coast, it makes a very loud growling noise.

104
00:13:03,003 --> 00:13:05,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Like my car is angry that I'm driving it or something.

105
00:13:05,904 --> 00:13:15,490
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, mine started whenever... It's like if I'm going low speeds, anything like 20 miles per hour or below, and then I proceed to brake, it's starting to squeal.

106
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,271
[SPEAKER_08]: But if it's raining, it won't squeal.

107
00:13:18,551 --> 00:13:20,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't know what the hell is wrong with mine.

108
00:13:20,392 --> 00:13:22,053
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm thinking about taking it in, but...

109
00:13:23,268 --> 00:13:23,969
[SPEAKER_08]: Ford Fix or Repair Daily

110
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,048
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but they're cheap.

111
00:13:54,589 --> 00:13:55,889
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's the whole concept.

112
00:13:56,649 --> 00:14:00,111
[SPEAKER_08]: You buy a cheap car, you get a shoddy car, but it'll last a few years.

113
00:14:00,571 --> 00:14:01,911
[SPEAKER_03]: And you've made this comparison before.

114
00:14:01,931 --> 00:14:05,293
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like talking about the Mad Catz dance pads for DDR.

115
00:14:05,313 --> 00:14:09,114
[SPEAKER_03]: The $20 dance pads versus the $100 Ignition 2.0.

116
00:14:09,694 --> 00:14:10,054
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

117
00:14:10,595 --> 00:14:14,216
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're going to pay for an Ignition 2.0, you're going to get the quality of that.

118
00:14:14,256 --> 00:14:16,777
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to last a long time, but you're going to pay out the ass for it.

119
00:14:17,634 --> 00:14:23,716
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you're going to pay for the Mad Catz pad, you have to understand there's going to be some problems with it eventually.

120
00:14:24,156 --> 00:14:28,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Had Speedy Oil Change not killed my car, I wouldn't have this problem now, would I?

121
00:14:28,698 --> 00:14:34,700
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so that's kind of frustrating, and that's how I spent my day, was being frustrating.

122
00:14:35,061 --> 00:14:35,721
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's not fun.

123
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:38,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, take out your frustrations on our listeners.

124
00:14:38,802 --> 00:14:40,583
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

125
00:14:40,783 --> 00:14:41,603
[SPEAKER_14]: Damn you all.

126
00:14:41,803 --> 00:14:43,164
[SPEAKER_14]: Damn you all to hell.

127
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:46,319
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

128
00:14:46,439 --> 00:14:47,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else you want to share about your week?

129
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,220
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

130
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:49,881
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

131
00:14:50,141 --> 00:14:50,841
[SPEAKER_03]: How was Thanksgiving?

132
00:14:51,941 --> 00:14:53,582
[SPEAKER_08]: I talked about that, but you weren't listening.

133
00:14:54,002 --> 00:14:55,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I... Okay, never mind.

134
00:14:55,363 --> 00:14:56,763
[SPEAKER_08]: I said I had to do the two-family thing.

135
00:14:56,783 --> 00:14:58,964
[SPEAKER_08]: We went to Ross's family's house, and then we went to my family's house.

136
00:14:58,984 --> 00:15:01,725
[SPEAKER_03]: I was looking for... I was prying to get that other story you were telling me.

137
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:02,845
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay.

138
00:15:02,925 --> 00:15:03,626
[SPEAKER_03]: See?

139
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,306
[SPEAKER_03]: I was doing that prying thing.

140
00:15:05,346 --> 00:15:06,547
[SPEAKER_08]: Prying, okay.

141
00:15:06,587 --> 00:15:11,189
[SPEAKER_03]: That hosts do when they know that there's a topic that needs to be talked about, but they don't want to say that there's one.

142
00:15:11,289 --> 00:15:11,889
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so...

143
00:15:13,001 --> 00:15:19,346
[SPEAKER_08]: What we did is we decided to bring all of our odd music games with us.

144
00:15:19,386 --> 00:15:26,812
[SPEAKER_08]: So we brought our Taiko Drum Master and Donkey Konga and Karaoke Revolution 1, 2, and 3.

145
00:15:27,692 --> 00:15:30,334
[SPEAKER_08]: And we took them all over to my parents' house.

146
00:15:31,515 --> 00:15:37,880
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm guessing my mom had a little bit too much wine to drink because she was just having way too much fun on everything.

147
00:15:38,981 --> 00:15:40,462
[SPEAKER_08]: And my mom...

148
00:15:41,352 --> 00:15:43,213
[SPEAKER_08]: I noticed it runs in the family couldn't resist

149
00:15:59,998 --> 00:16:08,760
[SPEAKER_08]: So she tried to play Taiko Drum Master and she got like a 58% on some one-star easy song and just absolutely biffed it.

150
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:11,661
[SPEAKER_08]: So my brother-in-law, who's a drummer, had to show her up.

151
00:16:12,821 --> 00:16:23,904
[SPEAKER_08]: And then after he did that, my blind father took over the drum, asked us to put it on a song, and proceeded to outplay my mother.

152
00:16:25,492 --> 00:16:26,012
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

153
00:16:43,239 --> 00:16:49,341
[SPEAKER_08]: And at one point he stopped randomly, but we got him to start back up again.

154
00:16:49,381 --> 00:16:57,564
[SPEAKER_08]: And if he hadn't stopped and gotten off of his little groove that he was in, he probably would have passed the song, which is extremely scary.

155
00:16:58,744 --> 00:16:59,725
[SPEAKER_08]: But he ended up getting like a 48%.

156
00:17:00,885 --> 00:17:03,166
[SPEAKER_08]: He didn't beat my mom, but came within 10%.

157
00:17:03,626 --> 00:17:06,887
[SPEAKER_08]: So I can now say that my blind father can play Taiko Drum Master.

158
00:17:07,347 --> 00:17:07,687
[SPEAKER_03]: Very nice.

159
00:17:07,868 --> 00:17:10,330
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think this was a topic once in DDR Chit Chat.

160
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,132
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you play DDR when you're blind?

161
00:17:12,772 --> 00:17:13,253
You don't!

162
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:16,055
[SPEAKER_08]: You just kind of stomp on all the arrows.

163
00:17:16,175 --> 00:17:20,039
[SPEAKER_03]: You just kind of dance in the rhythm, and you'd be surprised at what you can do.

164
00:17:20,059 --> 00:17:23,262
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually haven't ever had my dad play DDR, but maybe I should.

165
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:25,124
[SPEAKER_08]: That might be funny.

166
00:17:26,705 --> 00:17:27,166
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

167
00:17:27,786 --> 00:17:29,668
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm thinking he would be good with Donkey Kong, too.

168
00:17:30,269 --> 00:17:30,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, very cool.

169
00:17:30,809 --> 00:17:31,130
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

170
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:31,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.

171
00:17:32,331 --> 00:17:32,651
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

172
00:17:33,683 --> 00:17:34,143
[SPEAKER_08]: That's about it.

173
00:17:34,263 --> 00:17:35,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we're going to move on.

174
00:17:35,224 --> 00:17:36,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk to DDR Angel.

175
00:17:36,284 --> 00:17:36,645
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your week?

176
00:17:36,665 --> 00:17:37,065
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your day?

177
00:17:37,285 --> 00:17:38,906
[SPEAKER_09]: How does a blind person play DDR?

178
00:17:38,986 --> 00:17:40,667
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh boy, what did I just walk into?

179
00:17:41,707 --> 00:17:44,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Same crap you've been walking into for the past, what, year and a half?

180
00:17:44,609 --> 00:17:45,189
[SPEAKER_09]: Almost two.

181
00:17:45,269 --> 00:17:46,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.

182
00:17:47,971 --> 00:17:48,811
[SPEAKER_09]: Not much going on.

183
00:17:48,851 --> 00:18:02,479
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, had two days of school this week, and that was pretty good because I really needed the break, just like I'm sure Jess did and all that.

184
00:18:03,992 --> 00:18:14,898
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, after school was over, just, you know, spent the last four days playing games that I haven't been able to play, and I got my DS!

185
00:18:15,579 --> 00:18:16,880
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay!

186
00:18:18,921 --> 00:18:27,966
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um, yeah, that took six stores to find, and it was not good until I walked away with it, and it was all good, so...

187
00:18:29,093 --> 00:18:32,154
[SPEAKER_09]: Best Buy is not your friend unless you call all the stores in Sacramento.

188
00:18:32,254 --> 00:18:32,534
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway!

189
00:18:33,215 --> 00:18:34,995
[SPEAKER_03]: I got my DS at Best Buy, what's your problem?

190
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:37,496
[SPEAKER_09]: I had to call six stores.

191
00:18:37,756 --> 00:18:38,657
[SPEAKER_09]: That was not cool.

192
00:18:40,237 --> 00:18:41,698
[SPEAKER_09]: Or however many stores you've got, four?

193
00:18:43,479 --> 00:18:45,099
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so I got my DS and it's all good.

194
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:49,001
[SPEAKER_09]: And the minigames on Mario 64 are your friend.

195
00:18:50,441 --> 00:18:52,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Minigames on Mario 64 DS rock.

196
00:18:52,622 --> 00:18:54,183
[SPEAKER_03]: They make that game worth it, they really do.

197
00:18:55,305 --> 00:18:59,268
[SPEAKER_09]: You can just spend all your time playing the minigames rather than playing the actual game.

198
00:19:00,189 --> 00:19:01,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Favorite minigame so far?

199
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,351
[SPEAKER_09]: The Bob-omb Slingshot game.

200
00:19:04,092 --> 00:19:04,632
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that one.

201
00:19:04,652 --> 00:19:09,176
[SPEAKER_03]: My other favorite one is the He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not, or They Love Me.

202
00:19:09,276 --> 00:19:10,437
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gender neutral, isn't it?

203
00:19:10,477 --> 00:19:12,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Loves Me, Loves Me Not, that's it.

204
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:14,079
[SPEAKER_09]: Koyoshi.

205
00:19:15,961 --> 00:19:17,522
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so lame, yet so fun.

206
00:19:18,863 --> 00:19:21,625
[SPEAKER_09]: We should get back on that Blind DDR topic later.

207
00:19:21,645 --> 00:19:23,327
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a reason for that.

208
00:19:24,007 --> 00:19:24,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, maybe we will.

209
00:19:25,436 --> 00:19:25,756
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay!

210
00:19:26,097 --> 00:19:26,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright!

211
00:19:26,597 --> 00:19:26,897
[SPEAKER_09]: Cool!

212
00:19:26,978 --> 00:19:27,338
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright!

213
00:19:27,398 --> 00:19:27,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah!

214
00:19:28,018 --> 00:19:28,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Islander, how was your week?

215
00:19:29,019 --> 00:19:29,560
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your day?

216
00:19:30,361 --> 00:19:31,181
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I was fine.

217
00:19:31,201 --> 00:19:34,164
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, pretty much Jessica's already summed it up.

218
00:19:34,184 --> 00:19:38,488
[SPEAKER_06]: For those of you who don't know, that Iwona Girl and I are a couple.

219
00:19:38,748 --> 00:19:39,109
[SPEAKER_06]: Duh.

220
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, it's a DDR couple.

221
00:19:42,412 --> 00:19:42,852
[SPEAKER_08]: We are?

222
00:19:42,872 --> 00:19:49,178
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought you were just, like, sleeping in my bed for no fair reason.

223
00:19:49,398 --> 00:19:49,498
Oh.

224
00:19:52,379 --> 00:19:53,680
[SPEAKER_20]: This is a TMI alert.

225
00:19:57,343 --> 00:19:58,824
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought you were just my sex slave.

226
00:19:58,864 --> 00:19:59,404
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

227
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:01,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, hey, hey.

228
00:20:03,367 --> 00:20:04,688
[SPEAKER_03]: The TMI SWAT team's here.

229
00:20:06,369 --> 00:20:21,500
[SPEAKER_06]: But no, just spent the days off playing games that we bought because we kind of went crazy and bought a shitload of games including Taiko, Donkey Konga,

230
00:20:22,818 --> 00:20:24,179
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh shit, KR3.

231
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,002
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys went on quite a little spending spree, didn't you?

232
00:20:28,242 --> 00:20:28,982
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

233
00:20:29,022 --> 00:20:30,183
[SPEAKER_08]: We went a little crazy.

234
00:20:31,123 --> 00:20:32,184
[SPEAKER_08]: But we've been good.

235
00:20:32,604 --> 00:20:34,626
[SPEAKER_06]: A little crazy, Rumble Roses.

236
00:20:35,546 --> 00:20:37,547
[SPEAKER_08]: We've lost almost 80 pounds, we earned it.

237
00:20:39,248 --> 00:20:44,972
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, just when I'm playing all these games that I'm like, holy crap, I have like new stuff to play now.

238
00:20:46,513 --> 00:20:48,074
[SPEAKER_06]: So, just been doing a lot of that lately.

239
00:20:48,234 --> 00:20:49,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.

240
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:51,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else you want to share about your

241
00:20:52,044 --> 00:20:53,465
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, let's see.

242
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:57,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Other than watching her blind father play Tycho.

243
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:03,732
[SPEAKER_06]: Trying to think what else was pretty remarkable this weekend.

244
00:21:06,654 --> 00:21:07,915
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I think she pretty much covered everything.

245
00:21:08,535 --> 00:21:09,276
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, fair enough then.

246
00:21:10,296 --> 00:21:11,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, my friend, how was your week?

247
00:21:11,717 --> 00:21:12,258
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your day?

248
00:21:14,419 --> 00:21:15,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, um...

249
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,270
[SPEAKER_04]: My week was okay, because it was short.

250
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:20,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Work-wise, it was short.

251
00:21:21,351 --> 00:21:24,152
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a potluck on Wednesday, and I had lots of food.

252
00:21:25,072 --> 00:21:27,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't really do anything, so that's cool.

253
00:21:28,313 --> 00:21:33,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Played Final Fantasy most of the week, and then... What else?

254
00:21:33,114 --> 00:21:35,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, just more DS crap.

255
00:21:35,855 --> 00:21:41,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Have like 41 stars now in Mario 64, and that game's frustrating as hell.

256
00:21:41,537 --> 00:21:41,617
[SPEAKER_04]: And...

257
00:21:42,997 --> 00:21:44,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I also bought two new games.

258
00:21:44,998 --> 00:21:50,760
[SPEAKER_04]: I bought Alien Hominid and Under the Skin, and those are strange.

259
00:21:50,801 --> 00:21:58,064
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Alien Hominid, though, because it reminds me of a hand-drawn version of Metal Slug, and it's pretty cool.

260
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:01,085
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, what else did I do?

261
00:22:01,265 --> 00:22:08,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, I had to get a new cheat device thing, so I bought the Code Breaker and stuff.

262
00:22:08,548 --> 00:22:10,429
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that was last week that I did that, but...

263
00:22:11,178 --> 00:22:11,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Grand Theft Auto 3

264
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:48,685
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why I bought this game, and...

265
00:23:05,245 --> 00:23:09,587
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that there were powers that be that coerced me into doing so against my will.

266
00:23:10,427 --> 00:23:13,189
[SPEAKER_03]: In other words, his girlfriend said, buy it or I'm not putting out.

267
00:23:17,411 --> 00:23:20,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Which, by the way, is very interesting when you consider his girlfriend is not a gamer at all.

268
00:23:21,593 --> 00:23:21,893
[SPEAKER_03]: At all.

269
00:23:23,413 --> 00:23:26,355
[SPEAKER_03]: But yet, she loves Mario 64 DS and she loves this game.

270
00:23:27,735 --> 00:23:28,996
[SPEAKER_03]: But I love her, so I forgive her.

271
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,363
[SPEAKER_04]: She just likes to watch my suffering.

272
00:23:35,984 --> 00:23:36,825
[SPEAKER_04]: She likes to watch?

273
00:23:38,567 --> 00:23:39,708
[SPEAKER_04]: She likes to participate.

274
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:41,651
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't know.

275
00:23:42,072 --> 00:23:42,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

276
00:23:44,014 --> 00:23:44,174
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

277
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:46,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I'm done.

278
00:23:47,873 --> 00:23:49,875
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, my week and my day.

279
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:51,978
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got to make this quick because I've got to get to a break pretty soon here.

280
00:23:52,018 --> 00:23:53,239
[SPEAKER_03]: But my week and my day was pretty cool.

281
00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:55,502
[SPEAKER_03]: I went out to Roseville Golf Land one night.

282
00:23:55,722 --> 00:23:56,663
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, gasp.

283
00:23:56,864 --> 00:23:58,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is the first time in months I've been there.

284
00:23:58,886 --> 00:24:00,548
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know we're an international show here.

285
00:24:00,588 --> 00:24:05,554
[SPEAKER_03]: So for those of you guys who don't know what Roseville Golf Land is, it's where Bomani games go to die, basically, and get disrepair.

286
00:24:06,234 --> 00:24:08,556
[SPEAKER_03]: But they have a brand new game called Derby Owners Club.

287
00:24:08,696 --> 00:24:10,117
[SPEAKER_08]: We went out twice this weekend.

288
00:24:10,217 --> 00:24:12,159
[SPEAKER_03]: And you've heard me talk about this game on the show before.

289
00:24:12,199 --> 00:24:14,821
[SPEAKER_03]: You've heard Jamie talk about this game zillions of times on the show before.

290
00:24:14,861 --> 00:24:15,482
[SPEAKER_03]: She loves this game.

291
00:24:15,922 --> 00:24:16,603
[SPEAKER_03]: I love this game too.

292
00:24:16,623 --> 00:24:17,503
[SPEAKER_03]: I made a brand new horse.

293
00:24:17,543 --> 00:24:19,365
[SPEAKER_03]: I called her Britney Spears so I could whip her.

294
00:24:20,185 --> 00:24:25,169
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was so proud of Britney because she came in second in my first race.

295
00:24:25,189 --> 00:24:25,950
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was very proud.

296
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:30,554
[SPEAKER_03]: But where did these people come from at Golf Land who know how to play Derby Owners Club all of a sudden?

297
00:24:30,874 --> 00:24:31,274
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy.

298
00:24:31,294 --> 00:24:32,135
[SPEAKER_06]: All of them come from UCD.

299
00:24:34,357 --> 00:24:36,119
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen a lot of UCD up there.

300
00:24:55,199 --> 00:24:55,739
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

301
00:25:14,241 --> 00:25:16,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know how that feels to be on your last step?

302
00:25:16,523 --> 00:25:19,525
[SPEAKER_03]: And before you can hit your last step, kaboom, failed.

303
00:25:19,905 --> 00:25:28,172
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, if it makes you feel better, I probably couldn't even pass anything past a seven-footer at this point.

304
00:25:28,772 --> 00:25:32,055
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how long it's been since I've played either.

305
00:25:32,175 --> 00:25:37,719
[SPEAKER_08]: And yet I am the head administrator of the largest DDR site in the world.

306
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,100
[SPEAKER_08]: What the hell?

307
00:25:39,261 --> 00:25:39,621
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

308
00:25:42,172 --> 00:25:43,073
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't get it myself.

309
00:25:43,153 --> 00:25:44,094
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the love of the game, though.

310
00:25:44,374 --> 00:25:52,560
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, honestly, I could suck at DDR, but when games like Ultramix 2 come out, I get in fanboy mode all over again, no matter if I suck at the game and I'm getting old or what.

311
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,061
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, speaking of Ultramix 2, we've got to cut it short.

312
00:25:55,081 --> 00:26:00,445
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got to go to a break, because when we come back from the break, Midihead from Ultramix 2 is going to be here on the program.

313
00:26:00,685 --> 00:26:01,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Very excited about that.

314
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:05,469
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want you guys to familiarize yourselves a little bit with Midihead, in case you forgot.

315
00:26:05,489 --> 00:26:09,712
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how you could, because it's one of the most kick-ass remixes we've had in a DDR game in a long time.

316
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:21,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Remix of one of our favorite artists, Akira Yamaoka, took his song, made it just, I can't say made it better, but certainly not made it worse, just made it different and cool, is what he did.

317
00:26:21,815 --> 00:26:23,616
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's In My Eyes, the Midi Head mix.

318
00:26:24,016 --> 00:26:26,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Check it out, and when we come back, Midi Head will be on the program.

319
00:26:26,337 --> 00:26:26,757
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be back.

320
00:28:29,013 --> 00:28:31,354
[SPEAKER_03]: It is I. It is I. Hello, welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.

321
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,121
[SPEAKER_21]: Greetings.

322
00:28:59,441 --> 00:29:00,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, how you doing?

323
00:29:01,764 --> 00:29:03,146
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, I'm doing great.

324
00:29:03,166 --> 00:29:05,449
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm just lounging around in my shorts.

325
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:07,191
[SPEAKER_21]: I see.

326
00:29:07,772 --> 00:29:14,340
[SPEAKER_21]: Being as we're in Southern California, and it's actually kind of nippy outside, but

327
00:29:14,784 --> 00:29:17,065
[SPEAKER_21]: Here in my studio, it's nice and toasty.

328
00:29:17,245 --> 00:29:18,605
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been pretty cold up here, too.

329
00:29:18,645 --> 00:29:21,026
[SPEAKER_03]: We're based out of Sacramento, so we're not that far away.

330
00:29:21,046 --> 00:29:22,126
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just a stone's throw away.

331
00:29:23,026 --> 00:29:24,387
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not cold up there.

332
00:29:24,767 --> 00:29:26,888
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been freezing up here these past few days.

333
00:29:26,928 --> 00:29:27,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't you guys think so?

334
00:29:28,148 --> 00:29:36,030
[SPEAKER_21]: In the 40s, during... Have you guys ever been to New York City or Park City or any of those towns this time of year?

335
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:42,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Not this time of year, but I went there during the summer, and that was bad enough at night, this one night, so...

336
00:29:43,455 --> 00:29:45,056
[SPEAKER_21]: You don't know cold, my friend!

337
00:29:46,097 --> 00:29:47,378
[SPEAKER_21]: That's why we live here.

338
00:29:47,999 --> 00:29:49,160
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly, that's why we live here.

339
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,122
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been there, and that's why we live in California.

340
00:29:51,542 --> 00:29:52,043
[SPEAKER_21]: That's right.

341
00:29:53,364 --> 00:29:58,389
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, the folks that created Ultramix 2, they're over in Hawaii, so they've got to be loving it year-round there.

342
00:29:59,189 --> 00:30:07,417
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, they're getting the tropical moisture, so their skin's all nice and young-looking.

343
00:30:07,665 --> 00:30:10,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Except for the occasional tropical storm and things like that.

344
00:30:11,147 --> 00:30:12,727
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, who cares?

345
00:30:12,847 --> 00:30:14,408
[SPEAKER_21]: It's worth living in Hawaii for that.

346
00:30:15,208 --> 00:30:15,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

347
00:30:15,829 --> 00:30:17,870
[SPEAKER_03]: I would live there any old day of the week.

348
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:24,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of Hawaii, I'm kind of curious, Middy, how did you become involved with those guys and getting into DDR Ultimix 2?

349
00:30:26,133 --> 00:30:35,938
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, actually, I called them on the phone one day and I bribed them and said I would give them my wife and children if they let me do the remix for them.

350
00:30:37,867 --> 00:30:38,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

351
00:30:38,227 --> 00:30:40,948
[SPEAKER_03]: So what will your wife and child be doing at Konami now?

352
00:30:43,249 --> 00:30:43,849
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

353
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:49,352
[SPEAKER_21]: Now they're going to hear this and go, you sold us.

354
00:30:49,432 --> 00:31:05,258
[SPEAKER_21]: So really what happened is I got contacted by my label, A Different Drum, and there was a bulletin that went out to all of the artists on the label who said, hey,

355
00:31:06,961 --> 00:31:18,083
[SPEAKER_21]: Konami wants to do this remix and they also want track submissions for the Ultramix 2 game and anybody who's interested can hear the details.

356
00:31:18,123 --> 00:31:34,107
[SPEAKER_21]: So basically I just got the tracks, the original tracks from Konami and it was kind of a free-for-all so I just did one and just kind of submitted it not really thinking that it was going to go anywhere

357
00:31:35,587 --> 00:31:47,934
[SPEAKER_21]: and next thing I know I get a call from Jaron Tolman, who's one of their head sound designers down there, and he said, hey, Konami liked it so much they want you to do an extended remix.

358
00:31:48,495 --> 00:31:52,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, which is the one we see on the V-Rare, that super long mix, right?

359
00:31:52,677 --> 00:31:53,537
[SPEAKER_21]: Super long!

360
00:31:53,557 --> 00:31:54,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Super long!

361
00:31:54,458 --> 00:31:57,980
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, so that's how I got involved.

362
00:31:59,309 --> 00:32:00,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool, very cool.

363
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:04,314
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's lots of great music from a different drum, including Ultramix 2.

364
00:32:04,634 --> 00:32:19,409
[SPEAKER_03]: And I gotta tell you, I don't know how much of the scene you've kind of been watching and kind of the reaction from the DDR fans, but a lot of folks have been really into Ultramix 2 and they kind of credit a lot of the success of the game because of the song list and because of a lot of the music that comes from a different drum.

365
00:32:19,709 --> 00:32:21,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Fans such as Echo Image...

366
00:32:21,411 --> 00:32:24,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Day Behavior, and all those folks, and yourself, all coming over from a different drum.

367
00:32:25,113 --> 00:32:25,673
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been great.

368
00:32:25,733 --> 00:32:27,534
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a great, I think, collaboration.

369
00:32:27,574 --> 00:32:29,535
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you guys work together more in the future.

370
00:32:30,215 --> 00:32:42,060
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, you know, I know that Konami's let the door open, so they've really liked what's come out of a different drum, and myself included.

371
00:32:43,601 --> 00:32:45,282
[SPEAKER_21]: So, what they...

372
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:56,299
[SPEAKER_21]: What they're grateful for is the fact they're not dealing with these prima donnas on these larger labels.

373
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:03,865
[SPEAKER_21]: They have all these demands and we just want to get our music out there and get it to the fans.

374
00:33:04,684 --> 00:33:09,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, I would dance to Skulk, Close Your Eyes, The In My Eyes remix.

375
00:33:09,205 --> 00:33:14,786
[SPEAKER_03]: I would dance to that long before I danced to Britney on DDR.

376
00:33:14,806 --> 00:33:19,807
[SPEAKER_21]: You say that now, but if Britney was now standing in front of you with... Yeah, that's a good point.

377
00:33:20,427 --> 00:33:21,448
[SPEAKER_21]: Britney, I'm your biggest fan.

378
00:33:21,828 --> 00:33:22,608
[SPEAKER_21]: Come on, I know.

379
00:33:24,208 --> 00:33:27,349
[SPEAKER_21]: She'd be dancing to Britney all night if she was sitting right there in your recliner.

380
00:33:29,797 --> 00:33:30,277
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a point.

381
00:33:30,517 --> 00:33:37,763
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to ask, since we're kind of talking about DDR here, did you know about DDR before you became involved with the project?

382
00:33:37,783 --> 00:33:38,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you ever play it?

383
00:33:38,703 --> 00:33:39,724
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you mentioned you had a kid.

384
00:33:40,064 --> 00:33:44,007
[SPEAKER_21]: I got to tell you guys, this is going to piss off some of your listeners.

385
00:33:44,248 --> 00:33:44,808
[SPEAKER_21]: That's all right.

386
00:33:44,828 --> 00:33:48,010
[SPEAKER_03]: We piss them off enough.

387
00:33:48,331 --> 00:33:57,858
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, I used to be extremely into video games and found them to, it was kind of,

388
00:33:58,208 --> 00:34:16,239
[SPEAKER_21]: I won't say it's a waste of time, but for me, it was like getting in the way of producing albums, and basically, since I have a family, I have to be a responsible adult now, so I kind of got out of the whole video game thing.

389
00:34:16,279 --> 00:34:19,861
[SPEAKER_21]: I used to be heavily into, do you guys remember Descent?

390
00:34:21,062 --> 00:34:23,344
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh yeah, I used to play that, yeah.

391
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:37,363
[SPEAKER_21]: and then, you know, most recently I was heavily into the Quake 3 add-on mod, Urban Terror.

392
00:34:38,044 --> 00:34:38,785
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, okay.

393
00:34:39,085 --> 00:34:40,046
[SPEAKER_21]: Man after my own heart.

394
00:34:40,887 --> 00:34:43,950
[SPEAKER_21]: That is by far the best game I've played to date.

395
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:44,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Now...

396
00:34:45,467 --> 00:34:47,087
[SPEAKER_21]: I've never played BDR, though, guys.

397
00:34:47,127 --> 00:34:47,647
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sorry.

398
00:34:47,968 --> 00:34:48,568
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all right.

399
00:34:48,608 --> 00:34:49,028
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all right.

400
00:34:49,188 --> 00:34:54,709
[SPEAKER_03]: You were talking some stuff to me before the show that I totally wasn't getting either, so now we're even, okay?

401
00:34:54,989 --> 00:34:56,949
[SPEAKER_03]: We're even.

402
00:34:57,089 --> 00:35:03,391
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, you sound like the kind of guy, though, that if you were still playing video games, you would be playing Halo 2 with the rest of us right now, I think.

403
00:35:04,091 --> 00:35:08,232
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I would be playing until my usual 4 or 5 o'clock in the morning.

404
00:35:08,292 --> 00:35:11,952
[SPEAKER_03]: And you would be getting your ass kicked by 13-year-olds, just like the rest of us do.

405
00:35:12,052 --> 00:35:12,592
[SPEAKER_21]: Exactly.

406
00:35:12,632 --> 00:35:14,793
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, what's funny is I actually had a...

407
00:35:15,652 --> 00:35:23,780
[SPEAKER_21]: I had a 13-year-old show me some moves on Urban Terror one night late when we had the whole entire board to ourselves while everybody else went to bed.

408
00:35:26,142 --> 00:35:26,823
[SPEAKER_21]: It was kind of funny.

409
00:35:27,804 --> 00:35:33,950
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm 33 and this little 13-year-old is showing me stuff that I would have never figured out on my own.

410
00:35:34,338 --> 00:35:34,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

411
00:35:35,779 --> 00:35:36,780
[SPEAKER_03]: The kids these days.

412
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:38,481
[SPEAKER_03]: The kids these days?

413
00:35:38,561 --> 00:35:39,922
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel so old saying that myself.

414
00:35:39,942 --> 00:35:44,405
[SPEAKER_13]: Where is our youth going?

415
00:35:45,086 --> 00:35:51,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Midyette, I wanted to ask you about the song that you specifically remixed, In My Eyes, a track originally done by Akira Yamaoka.

416
00:35:52,431 --> 00:35:58,555
[SPEAKER_03]: You kind of mentioned that you had a lot of the original Konami tracks, so was it your choice to remix that particular song?

417
00:35:59,676 --> 00:36:01,037
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, you know, I think...

418
00:36:04,344 --> 00:36:16,793
[SPEAKER_21]: Out of the two songs that I was given, that one kind of stuck out the most because the chord progression, I knew right away what to do with it when I heard it.

419
00:36:18,315 --> 00:36:28,222
[SPEAKER_21]: I pretty much took out all of his musical elements, left the vocals, and just redid everything from the ground up.

420
00:36:28,723 --> 00:36:39,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you can tell that, like, a lot of... It's not just, you know, you took a song and added a new beat to it, but you just totally kind of deconstructed it and then built it from the ground up, and I think that's part of what's so great about it.

421
00:36:40,226 --> 00:36:40,526
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

422
00:36:40,546 --> 00:36:41,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

423
00:36:41,206 --> 00:36:41,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

424
00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:43,247
[SPEAKER_03]: No problem, no problem, anytime.

425
00:36:44,047 --> 00:36:46,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you gotten a chance to talk to Akira about the remix at all?

426
00:36:46,628 --> 00:36:48,308
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you got a chance to meet him.

427
00:36:48,328 --> 00:36:51,009
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, you know, he and I talk every day, and he calls me...

428
00:36:52,219 --> 00:36:55,880
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, we got to talk to him one time, and unfortunately we didn't get him on air.

429
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,061
[SPEAKER_03]: We got to talk to him one time, and I tell you, we were just giddy little fanboys.

430
00:36:59,141 --> 00:36:59,901
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just amazing.

431
00:36:59,981 --> 00:37:02,841
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know if you've ever played... No, actually, I haven't spoke to him.

432
00:37:02,881 --> 00:37:05,822
[SPEAKER_21]: I have no idea how he feels about the remix whatsoever.

433
00:37:06,802 --> 00:37:07,222
[SPEAKER_03]: No clue.

434
00:37:07,322 --> 00:37:08,003
[SPEAKER_03]: We should find out.

435
00:37:08,023 --> 00:37:09,103
[SPEAKER_03]: We have ways of finding out.

436
00:37:09,743 --> 00:37:14,024
[SPEAKER_21]: For all I know, he thinks, you know, this is garbage.

437
00:37:14,988 --> 00:37:16,529
[SPEAKER_21]: What has he done to my song?

438
00:37:16,689 --> 00:37:17,549
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

439
00:37:17,589 --> 00:37:18,710
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm sure he loves it.

440
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:22,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Trust me, there's been some remixes in DDR in the past that were absolute garbage.

441
00:37:22,951 --> 00:37:24,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Yours is not garbage.

442
00:37:24,472 --> 00:37:25,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't worry about it.

443
00:37:25,532 --> 00:37:26,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

444
00:37:27,013 --> 00:37:28,213
[SPEAKER_21]: My head is swelling now.

445
00:37:28,754 --> 00:37:29,454
[SPEAKER_21]: It's huge.

446
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:29,954
[SPEAKER_03]: You're right.

447
00:37:29,994 --> 00:37:30,915
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to stop.

448
00:37:31,755 --> 00:37:34,416
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of equipment do you use to do these remixes in your studio?

449
00:37:35,768 --> 00:37:42,353
[SPEAKER_21]: Actually, I'm a big fan of... See, this will all go over your head.

450
00:37:42,553 --> 00:37:43,894
[SPEAKER_21]: We're back to the over your head thing.

451
00:37:44,034 --> 00:37:44,675
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, that's fine.

452
00:37:44,835 --> 00:37:46,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe some of our listeners will catch up on it.

453
00:37:46,836 --> 00:37:47,136
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

454
00:37:48,117 --> 00:37:52,140
[SPEAKER_21]: So, I actually use acid, and I'm not talking about white blotter.

455
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:57,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, now, my co-host Loki is very familiar with acid.

456
00:37:57,103 --> 00:37:58,464
[SPEAKER_03]: He does his own remixing in acid.

457
00:37:58,504 --> 00:37:59,485
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that I know.

458
00:37:59,505 --> 00:38:00,425
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm with you so far.

459
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:01,226
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, cool, cool.

460
00:38:01,666 --> 00:38:03,107
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, you know, a lot of people have...

461
00:38:04,915 --> 00:38:05,416
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks for watching!

462
00:38:17,492 --> 00:38:19,013
[SPEAKER_21]: Really cool stuff.

463
00:38:19,113 --> 00:38:21,614
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, I've been using it since the program first came out.

464
00:38:21,834 --> 00:38:25,515
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to point out, I'm sorry, I hate to cut you off, but I've got to say this.

465
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:42,142
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got to say this, because there's been these amateur remix contests that have happened throughout the Bomani scene that go on on such big websites, and they want to get people to remix stuff, and they always say, don't use Acid, because we want a program that is, we want something that doesn't sound like two songs meshed together.

466
00:38:42,502 --> 00:38:46,264
[SPEAKER_03]: I would just like to point out, the pros have just said that they use Acid.

467
00:38:47,549 --> 00:38:49,731
[SPEAKER_03]: So STFU, guys, STFU.

468
00:38:51,853 --> 00:39:01,081
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, it's a great program, especially now in version 5, but I use Acid in conjunction with, you know, I do a lot of the elements live, so I don't sequence much.

469
00:39:01,181 --> 00:39:07,246
[SPEAKER_21]: I actually just hit the record button, and we'll just play the sequence live.

470
00:39:07,747 --> 00:39:11,991
[SPEAKER_21]: If it's an arpeggiated piece, you know, that of course is sequenced, but...

471
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:18,786
[SPEAKER_21]: Most of it goes live into acid, then I just chop it up and dice it up and move stuff around.

472
00:39:18,806 --> 00:39:20,766
[SPEAKER_21]: It's just a lot faster that way.

473
00:39:20,786 --> 00:39:26,787
[SPEAKER_21]: And I use virtual instruments in addition to my Axis Virus KC.

474
00:39:26,847 --> 00:39:40,429
[SPEAKER_21]: I have all the Spectrasonics Stylus RMX, Atmosphere Trilogy, and of course, I've got software from Vanguard.

475
00:39:40,469 --> 00:39:41,730
[SPEAKER_21]: I use Vanguard and Zeta.

476
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:43,010
[SPEAKER_21]: And...

477
00:39:44,947 --> 00:39:45,947
[SPEAKER_21]: I love SoftSense.

478
00:39:47,388 --> 00:39:48,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.

479
00:39:48,168 --> 00:39:49,529
[SPEAKER_03]: Now see, Loki's following you here.

480
00:39:49,569 --> 00:39:50,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe that's just... Alright.

481
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:55,991
[SPEAKER_04]: See, well, I mean, you know, basically the stuff I do is very, very, very amateur.

482
00:39:56,031 --> 00:40:01,193
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm not even going as far as calling them actual remixes, more of just white label remixes and stuff.

483
00:40:01,513 --> 00:40:06,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, I don't really have the talent at the moment to be actually creating my own stuff.

484
00:40:06,494 --> 00:40:10,796
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically it's a lot of loop chopping and adding in a little bit of elements that way, but

485
00:40:11,257 --> 00:40:12,198
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

486
00:40:41,867 --> 00:40:42,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I guess.

487
00:40:44,569 --> 00:40:44,849
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

488
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:48,933
[SPEAKER_03]: You were mentioning that there was kind of two songs that you were sent.

489
00:40:49,433 --> 00:40:54,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Were there actually other songs that you remixed for DDR that didn't make it onto Ultramix 2?

490
00:40:54,958 --> 00:40:56,240
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, come on now.

491
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:59,322
[SPEAKER_21]: Would I have remixed a song that wouldn't have made it on DDR?

492
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:06,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, maybe I'm thinking maybe you're one of those artists that construct something and then you go, no, it's crap, it's crap, and you throw it out.

493
00:41:06,489 --> 00:41:07,169
[SPEAKER_21]: No, no, no, no, no.

494
00:41:08,436 --> 00:41:09,676
[SPEAKER_21]: No, man, I've been doing this since 1989.

495
00:41:09,836 --> 00:41:14,618
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, you know, that whole phase has been definitely worked out of me.

496
00:41:15,298 --> 00:41:19,519
[SPEAKER_21]: But, no, actually, this was the one song I remixed.

497
00:41:20,139 --> 00:41:24,340
[SPEAKER_21]: It was kind of a stab in the dark, and I threw it out there, and lo and behold.

498
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:26,721
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool, very cool.

499
00:41:27,381 --> 00:41:30,842
[SPEAKER_03]: And you mentioned that you might be doing this again for another Konami project.

500
00:41:30,882 --> 00:41:34,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you see yourself being involved with a future Konami game?

501
00:41:34,823 --> 00:41:36,203
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, sure, yeah, definitely.

502
00:41:36,844 --> 00:41:41,486
[SPEAKER_21]: Nothing specific at the moment, but like I said earlier, the door's open.

503
00:41:42,147 --> 00:41:45,368
[SPEAKER_21]: We've been in talks about keeping in touch and doing more.

504
00:41:46,209 --> 00:41:49,951
[SPEAKER_21]: They've been really happy with this last remix.

505
00:41:50,051 --> 00:41:51,251
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not just the remix.

506
00:41:51,271 --> 00:41:54,053
[SPEAKER_21]: You have to look at the actual business side, too.

507
00:41:54,193 --> 00:42:00,316
[SPEAKER_21]: If you're easy to deal with as an artist, this is just tips going out there to people trying to get their foot in the door.

508
00:42:01,156 --> 00:42:04,278
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not just the quality of the work that you do.

509
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:04,558
[SPEAKER_21]: It's

510
00:42:05,111 --> 00:42:08,253
[SPEAKER_21]: It's also your attitude and your business dealings with these guys.

511
00:42:08,593 --> 00:42:20,100
[SPEAKER_21]: If you're a professional from start to finish and you're very proficient and attentive, a lot of people make great music but can't get work.

512
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:24,262
[SPEAKER_21]: It's because they don't have the relationship thing down.

513
00:42:24,322 --> 00:42:28,565
[SPEAKER_21]: You've got to be able to have a good working relationship with these guys.

514
00:42:29,205 --> 00:42:30,226
[SPEAKER_03]: I absolutely agree.

515
00:42:30,266 --> 00:42:33,327
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I am all about kissing ass on this program.

516
00:42:33,507 --> 00:42:34,028
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, carefully.

517
00:42:35,003 --> 00:42:36,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you get the chocolates I sent you?

518
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:37,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Middy Head.

519
00:42:39,194 --> 00:42:40,136
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

520
00:42:40,156 --> 00:42:41,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you get the chocolates we sent?

521
00:42:42,236 --> 00:43:11,308
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah exactly I have a brown nose too now if the folks that are listening go on over to your website over at www.mittyhead.com and I hope that they do because it's a great website you notice that there's a lot of other stuff that you've worked with before you did some TV gigs you did some movie things in the past before but what I want to know have you worked with video game music ever before was this the first thing

522
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:13,766
[SPEAKER_21]: No, I've never worked with video game music before.

523
00:43:14,647 --> 00:43:21,168
[SPEAKER_21]: I moved out here to Los Angeles to try some things.

524
00:43:21,648 --> 00:43:29,290
[SPEAKER_21]: The first stuff I did was for Fox Television's Dark Angel.

525
00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:41,373
[SPEAKER_21]: When that happened, I started landing tracks through my publisher in a lot of different television shows and then was able to get one landed in the Matrix Reloaded movie trailer

526
00:43:42,046 --> 00:43:43,747
[SPEAKER_21]: Just prior to the film's release.

527
00:43:45,188 --> 00:43:47,489
[SPEAKER_21]: So that had been most of my experience.

528
00:43:47,849 --> 00:43:52,032
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'd looked into video games several times going, you know, I should do that.

529
00:43:52,072 --> 00:43:52,832
[SPEAKER_21]: I should get into that.

530
00:43:53,412 --> 00:43:54,713
[SPEAKER_21]: I had no idea how.

531
00:43:55,754 --> 00:43:57,114
[SPEAKER_21]: I had friends that were doing it.

532
00:43:57,494 --> 00:43:59,576
[SPEAKER_21]: And I asked them how I'd get involved.

533
00:43:59,596 --> 00:44:06,039
[SPEAKER_21]: And they said, you know, it's a nightmare trying to get in there because so many people are trying to do it.

534
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:11,222
[SPEAKER_21]: So I just never really pursued it because I always had other things that I...

535
00:44:11,986 --> 00:44:12,366
[SPEAKER_21]: and many more.

536
00:44:34,141 --> 00:44:34,761
[SPEAKER_21]: are doing well.

537
00:44:36,202 --> 00:44:40,505
[SPEAKER_03]: There are folks who actually were in Ultramix 2 that are quite familiar with the video game music stuff.

538
00:44:40,685 --> 00:44:45,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesper Kidd, I know, is one of them, and he's done a lot of previous video game stuff, and now he's kind of crossing over into DDR.

539
00:44:45,907 --> 00:44:54,032
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, there's lots of, I think, opportunities for making great music for video games out there, you know, especially what they keep saying is getting bigger than movies now.

540
00:44:54,272 --> 00:44:54,692
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

541
00:44:54,852 --> 00:44:55,393
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, who knows?

542
00:44:55,593 --> 00:44:55,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

543
00:44:56,587 --> 00:45:03,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I know you're going to be putting in a live appearance at this upcoming convention, this OtakuCon, is that what it's called?

544
00:45:03,610 --> 00:45:04,591
[SPEAKER_20]: OtakuCon?

545
00:45:05,591 --> 00:45:06,312
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on with that?

546
00:45:06,352 --> 00:45:07,212
[SPEAKER_03]: How'd you get involved with that?

547
00:45:08,693 --> 00:45:11,654
[SPEAKER_21]: Again, you know, my label got involved in that.

548
00:45:12,015 --> 00:45:20,299
[SPEAKER_21]: They were contacted, a different drum was contacted by OtakuCon about having a different drum be involved, and of course...

549
00:45:21,658 --> 00:45:28,441
[SPEAKER_21]: Because of my involvement in DDR, I was one of the first artists contacted to be in that.

550
00:45:29,602 --> 00:45:32,523
[SPEAKER_03]: The otakus love DDR, just so you know.

551
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:33,824
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh yeah, yeah.

552
00:45:33,844 --> 00:45:37,466
[SPEAKER_21]: So we'll be performing that track live on stage.

553
00:45:39,526 --> 00:45:42,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Just so you guys know, that's going to be in Miami Beach.

554
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:47,310
[SPEAKER_03]: If any of you guys are in that area or planning on traveling, the convention is happening December 17th through the 19th.

555
00:45:47,350 --> 00:45:50,272
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to check out more information, it's otakucon.com.

556
00:45:50,292 --> 00:45:51,092
[SPEAKER_03]: The midi head is going to be there.

557
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:56,662
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll be there with some Tasty Babes up on stage, my friend.

558
00:45:56,902 --> 00:45:58,844
[SPEAKER_03]: I always perform with Tasty Babes.

559
00:45:58,864 --> 00:46:00,346
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to have the dual sex appeal.

560
00:46:00,366 --> 00:46:03,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, they actually do have talent.

561
00:46:15,772 --> 00:46:16,552
[SPEAKER_03]: and so on.

562
00:46:36,431 --> 00:46:37,232
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

563
00:47:01,992 --> 00:47:06,636
[SPEAKER_03]: I really, to be honest, I had no clue a lot of this music was out there before DDR.

564
00:47:07,036 --> 00:47:15,723
[SPEAKER_03]: It was kind of like, because of my involvement with this show, I kind of, you know, when this music was announced, I kind of went on over to the site and I was kind of checking out some of the music by the artists.

565
00:47:15,763 --> 00:47:16,784
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, this stuff is great.

566
00:47:17,305 --> 00:47:18,125
[SPEAKER_03]: This stuff is really great.

567
00:47:18,226 --> 00:47:21,949
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it's stuff you probably wouldn't hear of if you didn't think to look.

568
00:47:21,989 --> 00:47:23,610
[SPEAKER_21]: It's definitely not the mainstream.

569
00:47:23,630 --> 00:47:24,110
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely not.

570
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:25,692
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, it's synth pop.

571
00:47:26,592 --> 00:47:29,235
[SPEAKER_21]: And what's interesting, though, is because...

572
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:34,881
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know how old you guys are, but I don't know if you remember the 80s at all.

573
00:47:35,781 --> 00:47:36,321
[SPEAKER_21]: A little bit.

574
00:47:36,701 --> 00:47:38,262
[SPEAKER_21]: A guano girl is lighting up over there.

575
00:47:38,282 --> 00:47:39,562
[SPEAKER_21]: It was a blur, man.

576
00:47:39,622 --> 00:47:41,062
[SPEAKER_07]: If it makes you feel better, I'm 27.

577
00:47:41,702 --> 00:47:43,663
[SPEAKER_21]: I was just passing out of the uterus then.

578
00:47:43,683 --> 00:47:45,683
[SPEAKER_21]: No, no, no, no.

579
00:47:46,003 --> 00:47:49,224
[SPEAKER_03]: I may sound young, but I'm actually 26, so I do remember the 80s.

580
00:47:49,264 --> 00:47:50,444
[SPEAKER_21]: You're not that young, man.

581
00:47:50,544 --> 00:47:51,584
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, all right, cool.

582
00:47:51,924 --> 00:47:52,544
[SPEAKER_21]: We remember the 80s.

583
00:47:52,604 --> 00:47:53,005
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all good.

584
00:47:55,755 --> 00:48:03,899
[SPEAKER_21]: I used to DJ in the 80s, and so a lot of the music that comes off via different drum label is kind of reminiscent of that era.

585
00:48:05,619 --> 00:48:06,740
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm loving, too.

586
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:14,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the Naropa song, I remember when I heard that the first time, I was like, it's like Depeche Mode meets Erasure meets, like, cool.

587
00:48:14,723 --> 00:48:15,644
[SPEAKER_03]: I just loved it.

588
00:48:16,707 --> 00:48:18,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely a lot of 80s remnants and stuff in there.

589
00:48:18,809 --> 00:48:19,889
[SPEAKER_10]: Very cool.

590
00:48:19,950 --> 00:48:21,351
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to pass this along to you now.

591
00:48:21,391 --> 00:48:25,254
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually have somebody in our chat room right now over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

592
00:48:25,274 --> 00:48:25,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Click on chat.

593
00:48:26,074 --> 00:48:28,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody that works for Konami.

594
00:48:28,776 --> 00:48:36,702
[SPEAKER_03]: And he actually says that their product manager, Jason Enos, said that Akira has heard the remix you did and he likes it a lot.

595
00:48:37,183 --> 00:48:38,143
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm supposed to let you know.

596
00:48:38,584 --> 00:48:39,284
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm supposed to let you know.

597
00:48:40,265 --> 00:48:42,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Right on.

598
00:48:42,287 --> 00:48:44,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, I'm glad that the information could come to us that fast.

599
00:48:45,029 --> 00:48:46,050
[SPEAKER_21]: God bless the internet.

600
00:48:46,070 --> 00:48:46,490
[SPEAKER_21]: Look at that.

601
00:48:47,006 --> 00:48:49,487
[SPEAKER_21]: A first ever in the life of Middy Head.

602
00:48:49,527 --> 00:48:50,847
[SPEAKER_21]: He hears from the man himself.

603
00:48:51,987 --> 00:48:52,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm not really the man.

604
00:48:53,248 --> 00:48:55,288
[SPEAKER_21]: Live on Orange Lounge Radio.

605
00:48:56,649 --> 00:48:58,889
[SPEAKER_21]: That was my best Roger Radio voice, by the way.

606
00:48:59,189 --> 00:49:00,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the Morning Drive.

607
00:49:01,390 --> 00:49:04,571
[SPEAKER_21]: Welcome to the Morning Drive.

608
00:49:08,629 --> 00:49:11,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go on over to Iguana Girl and check on that traffic.

609
00:49:11,892 --> 00:49:15,335
[SPEAKER_21]: We've got an accident on the I-5.

610
00:49:15,715 --> 00:49:24,802
[SPEAKER_21]: I used to intern at a Top 40 radio station back when I was 14 years old is when I started to get into radio.

611
00:49:27,004 --> 00:49:35,230
[SPEAKER_21]: I sat down in the general manager's office at the radio station about the time I was 16 years old, and he said, Mike,

612
00:49:35,974 --> 00:49:40,660
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sorry to tell you this, but I don't think you have the voice for radio.

613
00:49:41,361 --> 00:49:46,208
[SPEAKER_21]: So I passed up the career, guys.

614
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:50,053
[SPEAKER_21]: I know it sounds like I should have stuck with it, but...

615
00:49:53,317 --> 00:49:58,299
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to admit, I've hit a few roadblocks on my way up the radio ladder.

616
00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:00,100
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why I'm stuck here doing internet radio.

617
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:09,064
[SPEAKER_03]: But see, the way I figure is that together, when we work together like this, when the indie labels come together with the indie radio stations, we're going to take over the world!

618
00:50:10,325 --> 00:50:11,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, man!

619
00:50:11,105 --> 00:50:12,245
[SPEAKER_07]: Define and conquer!

620
00:50:13,446 --> 00:50:14,386
[SPEAKER_07]: Power to the people!

621
00:50:16,027 --> 00:50:16,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Right on.

622
00:50:17,108 --> 00:50:18,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, what...

623
00:50:19,488 --> 00:50:21,650
[SPEAKER_03]: What other kind of future projects are you working on right now?

624
00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:23,652
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you've done work for TV and movies.

625
00:50:23,712 --> 00:50:25,634
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anything else upcoming that we can look forward to?

626
00:50:27,956 --> 00:50:32,120
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I'm going to be in several B-movies.

627
00:50:34,101 --> 00:50:37,585
[SPEAKER_21]: Since I'm in the Los Angeles area, there will be some of the adult film.

628
00:50:40,247 --> 00:50:41,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

629
00:50:41,428 --> 00:50:43,370
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, I hope everybody knows I'm just kidding.

630
00:50:44,275 --> 00:50:44,595
[SPEAKER_03]: You were?

631
00:50:44,695 --> 00:50:46,456
[SPEAKER_03]: No, yeah, yeah, okay, we're not kidding.

632
00:50:47,236 --> 00:50:49,196
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was looking forward to some Bow Chicka Bow Wow.

633
00:50:49,856 --> 00:50:51,217
[SPEAKER_21]: Bow Chicka Bow Wow.

634
00:50:51,697 --> 00:50:59,679
[SPEAKER_21]: But no, I'm actually working on a new album, and the title of the album is called Weapons of Mass Seduction.

635
00:51:02,219 --> 00:51:03,500
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds porno right there.

636
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:13,062
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, you know, I was afraid of that originally when I thought of the title, but because of my frustration with the media...

637
00:51:14,271 --> 00:51:20,536
[SPEAKER_21]: and pretty much just turning on the local television stations here in California.

638
00:51:20,576 --> 00:51:21,897
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know.

639
00:51:21,977 --> 00:51:32,344
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't want to get into politics, but I'm more of a conservative kind of guy than I would say liberal.

640
00:51:32,364 --> 00:51:33,184
[SPEAKER_21]: It just frustrates me.

641
00:51:34,318 --> 00:51:36,619
[SPEAKER_21]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

642
00:52:05,324 --> 00:52:10,086
[SPEAKER_03]: If they like that remix and are thinking, hmm, I want to check out some more Midihead stuff, where can they go to check some stuff out?

643
00:52:10,766 --> 00:52:12,687
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I think you said it earlier.

644
00:52:12,707 --> 00:52:13,507
[SPEAKER_21]: Everybody with me, ready?

645
00:52:14,608 --> 00:52:19,710
[SPEAKER_21]: www.midihead.com Works for me, works for me.

646
00:52:21,290 --> 00:52:23,371
[SPEAKER_03]: You have other albums out there right now too, right?

647
00:52:23,391 --> 00:52:30,694
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I have the first album I released called Power Undiminished.

648
00:52:32,091 --> 00:52:41,837
[SPEAKER_21]: The American Synth Pop Award in 2001 here in Hollywood, California for Best Album.

649
00:52:42,838 --> 00:52:50,282
[SPEAKER_21]: Also, more recently than that, Dividing Asunder.

650
00:52:52,443 --> 00:53:00,108
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm actually going to be doing my own radio broadcast here sometime next year.

651
00:53:00,618 --> 00:53:14,131
[SPEAKER_21]: in the month of December before OtakuCon, where there will be a world premiere listening of my latest track, which has not been released yet, and that one's titled Away From Here.

652
00:53:14,851 --> 00:53:15,352
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, okay.

653
00:53:16,253 --> 00:53:21,698
[SPEAKER_21]: So I guess just check the website for that information, and I'll keep you posted.

654
00:53:22,038 --> 00:53:22,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds good.

655
00:53:22,478 --> 00:53:25,361
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're trying to break into the Internet radio world as well, huh?

656
00:53:25,976 --> 00:53:28,818
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, no, not... You know, I think it's fun.

657
00:53:28,838 --> 00:53:32,240
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, what you guys are doing, it sounds like you guys are having a good time.

658
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:32,680
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.

659
00:53:32,881 --> 00:53:37,544
[SPEAKER_21]: And, you know, I've always wanted to do my own show since I was a small kid.

660
00:53:38,584 --> 00:53:40,886
[SPEAKER_21]: And Internet has allowed us to do that.

661
00:53:41,426 --> 00:53:41,966
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

662
00:53:42,427 --> 00:53:45,969
[SPEAKER_21]: And, you know, I'm just going to try it out and see how I like it.

663
00:53:46,539 --> 00:53:49,341
[SPEAKER_21]: and maybe I'll do a once a month broadcast or something.

664
00:53:49,561 --> 00:53:51,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Be careful, it's really addicting.

665
00:53:51,923 --> 00:53:53,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Iguana Girl, how long have we been doing this?

666
00:53:54,005 --> 00:53:56,607
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been doing it for a couple years at least?

667
00:53:57,027 --> 00:53:58,888
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, yeah, probably like four or five now.

668
00:53:58,968 --> 00:54:03,572
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been involved in various shows for probably about five or six years, so it's pretty addicting.

669
00:54:04,219 --> 00:54:07,340
[SPEAKER_21]: You guys are doing Live 365, right?

670
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:10,480
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this current program we're doing is through Live 365, Orange Sounds Radio.

671
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:13,441
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're great to us, too.

672
00:54:13,521 --> 00:54:16,561
[SPEAKER_03]: So they've got a lot of great services for anybody that's looking into.

673
00:54:17,562 --> 00:54:24,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Even when they forgot to mention our name at the Best of Live 365 Awards, in which we were nominated in a category, and they completely forgot us.

674
00:54:25,563 --> 00:54:26,523
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a tragedy, man.

675
00:54:26,744 --> 00:54:27,664
[SPEAKER_03]: We forgave them for it.

676
00:54:27,684 --> 00:54:28,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have the clip?

677
00:54:31,556 --> 00:54:32,496
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish we had the clip.

678
00:54:32,556 --> 00:54:37,498
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love for Mitty Head to hear the clip because it's hilarious and I don't think our listeners have heard the clip in a long time either.

679
00:54:37,518 --> 00:54:38,798
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have to dig that up.

680
00:54:38,978 --> 00:54:44,140
[SPEAKER_21]: Wait, did they actually, you recorded the clip of them apologizing?

681
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:53,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the whole thing was broadcasted live and one of our listeners recorded it and sent the whole thing to us because it's hilarious because you can hear us in the background going, Hey!

682
00:54:54,423 --> 00:54:55,723
[SPEAKER_03]: They forgot our name.

683
00:54:56,983 --> 00:54:57,624
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty funny.

684
00:54:59,565 --> 00:55:02,847
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, I wanted to go ahead and allow our listeners a chance to ask some questions.

685
00:55:03,227 --> 00:55:08,530
[SPEAKER_03]: OrangeLoungeRadio.com, click on chat, and you can submit some questions live to us via our chat room.

686
00:55:09,130 --> 00:55:12,052
[SPEAKER_03]: For instance, we have Legend of Zaku is in our chat room.

687
00:55:12,072 --> 00:55:13,113
[SPEAKER_03]: He has a question for you here.

688
00:55:13,473 --> 00:55:17,255
[SPEAKER_03]: He wants to know, how did you approach doing the remixing itself?

689
00:55:17,335 --> 00:55:21,217
[SPEAKER_03]: In other words, what kind of inspired you to go about making the remix that you did?

690
00:55:22,918 --> 00:55:25,019
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that I wanted to come from a...

691
00:55:29,353 --> 00:55:31,074
[SPEAKER_21]: A cinematic sort of feel.

692
00:55:31,715 --> 00:55:41,820
[SPEAKER_21]: If you listen to the beginning of the track, it kind of starts out with some heavy, thunderous noises and stuff like that.

693
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:52,865
[SPEAKER_21]: So I kind of wanted it to be a very intense track, because I felt the vocal was conveying a sort of intensity there, and a seriousness.

694
00:55:53,906 --> 00:55:54,006
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

695
00:55:55,019 --> 00:55:56,219
[SPEAKER_21]: Does that answer the question?

696
00:55:56,359 --> 00:55:57,840
[SPEAKER_21]: I think so, I think so.

697
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:03,281
[SPEAKER_03]: They're responding to it in chat, they're saying, kind of giving it that epic sound, a little bit.

698
00:56:03,301 --> 00:56:07,422
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I wanted to, you know, but that's kind of how my sound is, hence the name Monolithic.

699
00:56:07,582 --> 00:56:11,123
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, everything I do has an epic kind of sound to it.

700
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:18,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that was something that we didn't quite kind of get into a little bit there before, but you actually work under several different names, not just Midihead, but Monolithic as well.

701
00:56:19,265 --> 00:56:19,685
[SPEAKER_21]: That's right.

702
00:56:19,865 --> 00:56:20,665
[SPEAKER_03]: So are there any other...

703
00:56:21,471 --> 00:56:23,312
[SPEAKER_03]: pseudonyms that you use as well for music?

704
00:56:23,393 --> 00:56:26,575
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, there is the sexy skinny guy.

705
00:56:29,157 --> 00:56:29,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, wait a minute.

706
00:56:29,557 --> 00:56:30,418
[SPEAKER_21]: I thought that was my name.

707
00:56:30,438 --> 00:56:35,202
[SPEAKER_21]: I had the trademark on that name.

708
00:56:35,902 --> 00:56:36,463
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's see.

709
00:56:37,083 --> 00:56:37,924
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, Trent Reznor.

710
00:56:38,284 --> 00:56:39,825
[SPEAKER_21]: You know him?

711
00:56:39,945 --> 00:56:40,686
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, all right.

712
00:56:42,347 --> 00:56:42,808
[SPEAKER_21]: No, no.

713
00:56:42,908 --> 00:56:43,788
[SPEAKER_21]: No, I'm sorry.

714
00:56:44,009 --> 00:56:46,050
[SPEAKER_21]: I wouldn't want to own up to that guy.

715
00:56:46,691 --> 00:56:49,313
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, he's got great talent and everything.

716
00:56:49,333 --> 00:56:49,573
[SPEAKER_21]: He just

717
00:56:50,236 --> 00:56:50,976
[SPEAKER_21]: That's a different direction.

718
00:56:50,996 --> 00:56:51,557
[SPEAKER_21]: He's just crazy.

719
00:56:52,177 --> 00:56:54,178
[SPEAKER_21]: A little different direction.

720
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:59,301
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what's interesting is there's actually one guy that does a lot, a lot of music for DDR and Naoki.

721
00:56:59,321 --> 00:57:01,182
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you've heard of him or not.

722
00:57:01,222 --> 00:57:01,882
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got a lot of tracks.

723
00:57:02,202 --> 00:57:07,245
[SPEAKER_03]: But that guy probably has like, what, 20 to 30 different pseudonyms he's done music under.

724
00:57:07,605 --> 00:57:08,205
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy.

725
00:57:08,285 --> 00:57:09,446
[SPEAKER_21]: You know what?

726
00:57:09,546 --> 00:57:10,347
[SPEAKER_21]: That's the way you do it.

727
00:57:10,587 --> 00:57:14,169
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know how many of the pseudonyms you know that Prince has.

728
00:57:14,189 --> 00:57:14,589
[SPEAKER_21]: True.

729
00:57:14,829 --> 00:57:18,431
[SPEAKER_21]: But Prince has tons and tons of pseudonyms.

730
00:57:18,471 --> 00:57:18,771
[SPEAKER_21]: He's really...

731
00:57:19,167 --> 00:57:19,347
[SPEAKER_21]: and so on.

732
00:57:42,611 --> 00:57:43,892
[SPEAKER_21]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

733
00:58:06,190 --> 00:58:08,632
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a comment from Sigurd in our chatroom.

734
00:58:08,652 --> 00:58:12,635
[SPEAKER_03]: He's the guy that actually works at Konami, and what Sigurd did at Konami is he was one of the testers.

735
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:17,359
[SPEAKER_21]: Wait a minute, before you get going here, is this chatroom just full of folks from Konami here?

736
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:19,641
[SPEAKER_03]: No, just the one.

737
00:58:19,881 --> 00:58:24,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, it's just fanboys and girls just like the rest of us that just love the games.

738
00:58:25,586 --> 00:58:31,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Sigurd's one of those cases where he was someone that was a fan and then actually kind of got in the door and got to work on one of the games.

739
00:58:31,971 --> 00:58:32,731
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.

740
00:58:32,852 --> 00:58:34,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he's a great guy.

741
00:58:34,953 --> 00:58:35,734
[SPEAKER_03]: He's been on the show before.

742
00:58:35,774 --> 00:58:36,514
[SPEAKER_03]: We like having him on.

743
00:58:36,534 --> 00:58:38,516
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, we might have him on later tonight.

744
00:58:38,776 --> 00:58:42,759
[SPEAKER_03]: But he worked on the steps, actually, part of the steps for DDR.

745
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:49,645
[SPEAKER_03]: And he wanted you to know that the step creation team thought that your song was easily one of the top songs that they had to work with.

746
00:58:49,905 --> 00:58:50,906
[SPEAKER_03]: So he just wanted to pass that along.

747
00:58:51,606 --> 00:58:52,307
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, that's great.

748
00:58:52,467 --> 00:58:53,368
[SPEAKER_21]: Tell him thank you.

749
00:58:54,308 --> 00:58:55,750
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he's listening, so hopefully he heard that.

750
00:58:56,270 --> 00:58:56,870
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, thank you.

751
00:58:56,930 --> 00:58:57,911
[SPEAKER_21]: You're a sweet man.

752
00:58:58,592 --> 00:58:59,152
[SPEAKER_03]: I love you.

753
00:59:00,854 --> 00:59:01,775
[SPEAKER_21]: and No I'm Not Gay.

754
00:59:03,696 --> 00:59:04,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

755
00:59:04,197 --> 00:59:05,338
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean that plutonically.

756
00:59:06,538 --> 00:59:06,879
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright.

757
00:59:07,419 --> 00:59:13,264
[SPEAKER_03]: Flaronay has a question, wants to know what other artists from the different drum label have you collaborated with in the past?

758
00:59:14,385 --> 00:59:16,086
[SPEAKER_21]: I've actually collaborated with a couple of them.

759
00:59:16,126 --> 00:59:17,767
[SPEAKER_21]: I want to do more collaboration.

760
00:59:19,188 --> 00:59:23,912
[SPEAKER_21]: I've just, well I'll just tell you that the artists I've done work with are NeuroActive.

761
00:59:25,914 --> 00:59:28,816
[SPEAKER_21]: I did a song with, his name's Jarko.

762
00:59:30,058 --> 00:59:31,478
[SPEAKER_21]: and obviously he's not American.

763
00:59:33,539 --> 00:59:43,822
[SPEAKER_21]: I did a song called Fiberoptic Rhythm and he sent me the music over the internet and I wrote the song, sent it back to him and he put it on the album.

764
00:59:45,962 --> 00:59:54,185
[SPEAKER_21]: I haven't really done much collaboration.

765
00:59:55,714 --> 00:59:58,216
[SPEAKER_21]: There's collaboration to be had, I know that.

766
00:59:58,497 --> 01:00:06,003
[SPEAKER_21]: I've been speaking with Jeff Pinckney of The Nine, one of my other favorite ADD label artists.

767
01:00:07,485 --> 01:00:11,969
[SPEAKER_21]: He's actually working with me right now doing some music for my publisher.

768
01:00:14,551 --> 01:00:18,014
[SPEAKER_21]: Hopefully he and I will be collaborating on some stuff in the future.

769
01:00:19,249 --> 01:00:19,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, cool.

770
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:22,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do one more question from our chat here.

771
01:00:22,671 --> 01:00:32,678
[SPEAKER_03]: We have MJB wants to know, are there any other songs in Bomani, which is what we call the music games that Konami puts out, including DDR and BBNA 2DX, etc.

772
01:00:32,878 --> 01:00:36,121
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there any other songs you've considered remixing in the series?

773
01:00:36,161 --> 01:00:43,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Has doing this remix you've already done kind of made you want to remix some other songs there in Bomani?

774
01:00:43,866 --> 01:00:45,027
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, you know, it's

775
01:00:46,045 --> 01:00:51,346
[SPEAKER_21]: Asking me if I want to remix something is like asking me if I want to wake up in the morning and have breakfast.

776
01:00:54,266 --> 01:00:55,587
[SPEAKER_21]: It's just a matter of choices.

777
01:00:55,907 --> 01:00:58,747
[SPEAKER_21]: I've got a whole cabinet full of cereal.

778
01:00:58,787 --> 01:01:01,548
[SPEAKER_21]: Do I pick the corn checks or the wheat checks?

779
01:01:05,168 --> 01:01:12,269
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not project-less, so I have my plate fairly full all the time with music projects.

780
01:01:12,289 --> 01:01:12,990
[SPEAKER_21]: Doing music for...

781
01:01:15,802 --> 01:01:16,943
[SPEAKER_21]: for television libraries.

782
01:01:16,963 --> 01:01:17,963
[SPEAKER_21]: It keeps me fairly busy.

783
01:01:18,183 --> 01:01:19,224
[SPEAKER_21]: Of course, I have my day job.

784
01:01:19,764 --> 01:01:22,785
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't really go out and seek after remix work.

785
01:01:23,265 --> 01:01:29,008
[SPEAKER_21]: Remix work, if somebody needs something done, they'll usually ask me now.

786
01:01:29,128 --> 01:01:30,188
[SPEAKER_21]: I used to have to seek it out.

787
01:01:30,869 --> 01:01:34,410
[SPEAKER_03]: That's when you know you've made it big time, when they come find you.

788
01:01:34,430 --> 01:01:36,831
[SPEAKER_21]: When you've made it big time, you've bought your home in Hollywood Hills.

789
01:01:40,077 --> 01:01:48,064
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, that's going to do it for the questions from our chat, but actually, we wanted to kind of wrap up and go to a song.

790
01:01:48,084 --> 01:01:49,005
[SPEAKER_03]: We're actually going to play something.

791
01:01:49,245 --> 01:01:52,508
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't, unfortunately, Middyhead, able to get that song that you sent me over email.

792
01:01:52,548 --> 01:01:59,634
[SPEAKER_03]: For some reason, my email's not coming up with a new message, so I thought maybe we could play a track from Diving Asunder, I'm sorry, Dividing Asunder, actually.

793
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:02,016
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought maybe we could do a song from there.

794
01:02:02,436 --> 01:02:07,721
[SPEAKER_03]: And, Middyhead, you're actually going to give some of our listeners some free stuff tonight, as I understand it?

795
01:02:08,785 --> 01:02:13,588
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, actually, we've got a couple of really great prizes to give away.

796
01:02:15,729 --> 01:02:21,833
[SPEAKER_21]: We've got a deep-sea fishing in the Salt Lake, the Great Salt Lake.

797
01:02:21,893 --> 01:02:28,357
[SPEAKER_21]: We have some deep-sea carp fishing trips to give away.

798
01:02:28,377 --> 01:02:31,179
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

799
01:02:31,947 --> 01:02:34,269
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that was in the email I saw.

800
01:02:34,609 --> 01:02:38,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you sure that wasn't like the Ryan Seacrest show or something?

801
01:02:39,373 --> 01:02:40,814
[SPEAKER_21]: Ice fishing in Alaska.

802
01:02:44,276 --> 01:02:50,621
[SPEAKER_21]: Actually, we're going to give away a couple of CDs from Dividing Ascender.

803
01:02:51,702 --> 01:02:53,583
[SPEAKER_21]: A couple of monolithic CDs, Dividing Ascender.

804
01:02:54,424 --> 01:03:00,028
[SPEAKER_21]: And if you want, I'll also pick a couple of listeners to...

805
01:03:02,369 --> 01:03:03,530
[SPEAKER_21]: to get some free downloads.

806
01:03:06,012 --> 01:03:13,117
[SPEAKER_21]: You can purchase MP3s off of MIDIhead.com as well of my previous albums if you want to get them in electronic format.

807
01:03:13,417 --> 01:03:15,018
[SPEAKER_03]: And Loki says he's already bought all three.

808
01:03:15,378 --> 01:03:15,538
[SPEAKER_21]: Yep.

809
01:03:15,759 --> 01:03:16,539
[SPEAKER_03]: All three albums.

810
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:20,422
[SPEAKER_21]: Dude, I appreciate you, man.

811
01:03:20,682 --> 01:03:21,102
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

812
01:03:21,283 --> 01:03:21,703
[SPEAKER_03]: No problem.

813
01:03:24,150 --> 01:03:28,373
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so if you want to win some free stuff, that's all you got to do.

819
01:03:43,724 --> 01:03:46,526
[SPEAKER_03]: And it sounds like we might be able to get some downloads for some other folks too.

820
01:03:46,626 --> 01:03:49,808
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll be contacting those of you guys that win.

[SPEAKER_03]: So send on over an email to Freestuff at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

822
01:03:53,991 --> 01:03:55,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Middy Head, thank you so much for being here on the show tonight.

823
01:03:56,012 --> 01:03:56,733
[SPEAKER_03]: We appreciate it.

824
01:03:57,493 --> 01:03:58,334
[SPEAKER_21]: You're welcome, guys.

825
01:03:58,374 --> 01:03:58,974
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a pleasure.

826
01:03:59,074 --> 01:04:00,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Did anybody else hear in the room?

827
01:04:00,515 --> 01:04:02,096
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been kind of quiet here in the room.

828
01:04:02,136 --> 01:04:04,357
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we've just all been kind of... We've been absorbing.

829
01:04:04,377 --> 01:04:05,598
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, Middy Head's so entertaining.

830
01:04:05,618 --> 01:04:06,738
[SPEAKER_16]: We're like sponges.

831
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:08,940
[SPEAKER_21]: I hear crickets.

832
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:10,140
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on over there?

833
01:04:10,821 --> 01:04:11,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no.

834
01:04:11,441 --> 01:04:13,863
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just mesmerized by your every word.

835
01:04:14,103 --> 01:04:14,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Fanboys.

836
01:04:14,983 --> 01:04:17,345
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, that was a safe answer.

837
01:04:18,665 --> 01:04:18,925
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

838
01:04:18,946 --> 01:04:20,226
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we do appreciate you being here.

839
01:04:20,246 --> 01:04:23,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Wish you the best of luck, and I hope we get to talk to you again in the future, all right?

840
01:04:23,903 --> 01:04:24,584
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sure you will.

841
01:04:24,744 --> 01:04:25,085
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

842
01:04:25,245 --> 01:04:26,046
[SPEAKER_03]: You take care of yourself.

843
01:04:26,086 --> 01:04:27,347
[SPEAKER_21]: Have a good night.

844
01:04:27,588 --> 01:04:29,330
[SPEAKER_21]: My love goes out to everyone listening.

845
01:04:29,790 --> 01:04:32,073
[SPEAKER_21]: And have a happy holiday, everyone.

846
01:04:32,253 --> 01:04:32,594
[SPEAKER_03]: You too.

847
01:04:33,255 --> 01:04:33,555
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks.

848
01:04:33,715 --> 01:04:34,015
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

849
01:04:34,055 --> 01:04:34,496
[SPEAKER_03]: Take care.

850
01:04:34,516 --> 01:04:34,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

851
01:04:36,604 --> 01:04:37,684
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, that was good.

852
01:04:38,385 --> 01:04:39,045
[SPEAKER_03]: What a nice guy.

853
01:04:39,065 --> 01:04:40,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome, very cool.

854
01:04:40,146 --> 01:04:45,488
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to say out there to our listeners, and I'm quoting, he uses acid.

855
01:04:45,848 --> 01:04:49,229
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm fucking going on every Bomani board and saying he fucking uses acid.

856
01:04:49,870 --> 01:04:50,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck you guys.

857
01:04:50,810 --> 01:04:52,551
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm entering the damn contest with acid.

858
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:56,412
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I was trying to get at when I cut him off.

859
01:04:56,693 --> 01:05:02,115
[SPEAKER_03]: How rude of me to cut the guy off while I'm interviewing him to make that very point, Loki, that...

860
01:05:02,873 --> 01:05:05,756
[SPEAKER_03]: The professionals are using acid, so shut up.

861
01:05:06,576 --> 01:05:08,738
[SPEAKER_03]: And let Loki use acid in the contest, people.

862
01:05:09,499 --> 01:05:15,724
[SPEAKER_08]: All you have to do is just make a nice little sound clip out of it, post it on the board and say, okay, listen to this, boom.

863
01:05:16,365 --> 01:05:22,089
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I associate like, you know, like a banner or something, you know, acid is midi head approved.

864
01:05:22,109 --> 01:05:22,270
Okay.

865
01:05:25,658 --> 01:05:29,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, once again, you guys, free stuff at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

866
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:30,261
[SPEAKER_03]: Just send an email.

867
01:05:30,401 --> 01:05:32,462
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all you have to do, and you might win some free stuff.

868
01:05:32,902 --> 01:05:34,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Middy Head, great guy.

869
01:05:34,543 --> 01:05:36,004
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a child of the 80s.

870
01:05:36,184 --> 01:05:36,925
[SPEAKER_03]: What else can he say?

871
01:05:37,545 --> 01:05:38,366
[SPEAKER_08]: Can't complain about that.

872
01:05:39,006 --> 01:05:40,747
[SPEAKER_08]: He's a man after my own heart.

873
01:05:40,787 --> 01:05:41,868
[SPEAKER_08]: The whole dissent thing.

874
01:05:42,765 --> 01:05:44,946
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, oh my god, I used to play that when I was a kid.

875
01:05:45,006 --> 01:05:46,947
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to have to invite him out for drinks at E3.

876
01:05:47,127 --> 01:05:47,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

877
01:05:47,688 --> 01:05:48,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

878
01:05:48,248 --> 01:05:49,589
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope he can make it.

879
01:05:49,689 --> 01:05:50,009
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

880
01:05:50,249 --> 01:05:51,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, let's check out.

881
01:05:51,590 --> 01:05:54,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's stop gushing for a minute here and let's hear some music.

882
01:05:54,912 --> 01:05:58,173
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to hear a track from the CD we're giving away tonight, Dividing Asunder.

883
01:05:58,593 --> 01:06:03,556
[SPEAKER_03]: This song is called Lulling Us to Sleep, which this show sometimes does to people, but not tonight.

884
01:06:03,596 --> 01:06:04,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Not tonight.

885
01:06:04,156 --> 01:06:08,699
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to hear this track and we will be right back with more Orange Lounge Radio.

886
01:06:19,908 --> 01:06:21,350
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching!

887
01:06:54,051 --> 01:07:17,831
[SPEAKER_11]: We are walking in our sleep And though our eyes are open Our slumber is so deep We rinse our souls with tearful face Our hypnotist has spoken The lullaby we sing

888
01:08:26,571 --> 01:08:29,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry guys, we're having some technical difficulties there.

889
01:08:29,575 --> 01:08:32,418
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, Bad Me, that song is rocking too.

890
01:08:32,478 --> 01:08:33,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry guys.

891
01:08:33,319 --> 01:08:34,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Say it again.

892
01:08:34,420 --> 01:08:37,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Internet radio is broke, left and right.

893
01:08:37,743 --> 01:08:38,424
[SPEAKER_03]: What can I say?

894
01:08:38,584 --> 01:08:40,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on, let's try this again.

895
01:08:40,687 --> 01:08:42,068
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that was my question also.

896
01:08:42,148 --> 01:08:43,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Is MidiHead singing it?

897
01:08:43,329 --> 01:08:44,671
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so.

898
01:08:44,771 --> 01:08:45,272
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure.

899
01:08:45,492 --> 01:08:46,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry guys.

900
01:09:28,260 --> 01:09:29,101
Thanks for watching!

Thanks for watching!

904
01:12:13,379 --> 01:12:21,987
[SPEAKER_20]: Hiho, Kermit the VOG here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.

905
01:12:22,027 --> 01:12:27,792
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

906
01:12:28,231 --> 01:12:28,791
[SPEAKER_03]: We are back here.

907
01:12:28,891 --> 01:12:30,332
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry for the technical difficulties there.

908
01:12:30,752 --> 01:12:32,033
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, you know, internet radio.

909
01:12:32,873 --> 01:12:33,353
[SPEAKER_03]: What can you say?

910
01:12:34,254 --> 01:12:37,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Monolithic, Lulling Us to Sleep, awesome song.

911
01:12:37,135 --> 01:12:39,216
[SPEAKER_03]: It's getting a great response in the chat room there.

912
01:12:40,076 --> 01:12:41,377
[SPEAKER_03]: This song is kicking ass.

913
01:12:41,857 --> 01:12:43,238
[SPEAKER_03]: This song is fucking hot.

914
01:12:43,638 --> 01:12:45,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Midi Head is the shit, etc., etc.

915
01:12:45,919 --> 01:12:49,200
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure MidiHead is happy to know that he's got plenty of new fanboys and girls there.

916
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:52,022
[SPEAKER_03]: And just being such a nice guy, especially there on the interview there.

917
01:12:52,042 --> 01:12:53,622
[SPEAKER_03]: So thanks again to MidiHead for being on the program.

[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, one email per person, please.

921

[SPEAKER_03]: Grr.

[SPEAKER_03]: Don't cheat.

923
01:13:08,864 --> 01:13:09,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Cheaters don't prosper.

924
01:13:09,444 --> 01:13:10,045
[SPEAKER_03]: People should know this by now.

925
01:13:10,065 --> 01:13:10,725
[SPEAKER_03]: If you cheat, you don't win.

926
01:13:10,745 --> 01:13:10,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Period.

927
01:13:10,885 --> 01:13:11,065
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

928
01:13:11,085 --> 01:13:12,686
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of winning, we have another giveaway that's still going on.

929
01:13:43,089 --> 01:13:44,530
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, boys and girls.

930
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:51,793
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time to conclude our signed Akira Yamaoka CD giveaway that's been going on the station for the past two weeks.

931
01:13:52,494 --> 01:13:56,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Jazz was our lucky winner last week of an autographed Akira Yamaoka CD.

932
01:13:56,776 --> 01:13:58,176
[SPEAKER_03]: Minidisc, Silent Hill 4.

933
01:13:58,497 --> 01:14:00,057
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys have been listening throughout the week.

934
01:14:00,498 --> 01:14:06,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Monday nights, Diversion, the Orange Launch Radio Remix show, where remixes and acid are A-OK by us.

935
01:14:08,383 --> 01:14:14,509
[SPEAKER_03]: and Tuesday nights to DarkSakura and her lovely program, Pump Up the Volume, and Thursday nights to Outside the Box.

936
01:14:14,569 --> 01:14:18,874
[SPEAKER_03]: And now, we're going to find ourselves a winner for the second signed Akira Yamaoka CD.

937
01:14:18,894 --> 01:14:21,376
[SPEAKER_20]: We're giving away so much free stuff tonight, I can't handle it.

938
01:14:22,377 --> 01:14:23,678
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Loki, find us a winner.

939
01:14:26,661 --> 01:14:27,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Who is it?

940
01:14:29,404 --> 01:14:32,067
[SPEAKER_03]: The winner is Dork!

941
01:14:33,581 --> 01:14:35,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Akira Yamaoka Signs CD

942
01:14:56,312 --> 01:14:57,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

943
01:15:21,363 --> 01:15:21,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

944
01:15:22,584 --> 01:15:23,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on with the program.

945
01:15:23,885 --> 01:15:25,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Gosh, where do we begin?

946
01:15:25,726 --> 01:15:27,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do we go?

947
01:15:28,047 --> 01:15:28,388
[SPEAKER_03]: News?

948
01:15:28,708 --> 01:15:29,848
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on in the news world?

949
01:15:29,868 --> 01:15:31,289
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on in the sim scene, Loki?

950
01:15:31,329 --> 01:15:35,332
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there's stuff going on in the sim world right now, in the worlds of DDR simulation.

951
01:15:35,952 --> 01:15:36,493
[SPEAKER_03]: He's thinking.

952
01:15:36,613 --> 01:15:37,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anything going on this week?

953
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:39,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really, no.

954
01:15:41,096 --> 01:15:42,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Not at all, actually.

955
01:15:44,011 --> 01:15:46,373
[SPEAKER_04]: And how the, no, no, no, no, nothing.

956
01:15:46,533 --> 01:15:48,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I guess one little thing to mention.

957
01:15:49,035 --> 01:15:57,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, Bomani Style, post-sending, if you guys are Guitar Freaks, Drum Mania fans, they have the sim files for, um, Guitar Freaks, I think, 1 through 10.

958
01:15:58,203 --> 01:16:00,244
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can get those in their media shop there.

959
01:16:00,465 --> 01:16:03,407
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's, you know, it's got all your, uh, GDA files for, um,

960
01:16:04,262 --> 01:16:08,243
[SPEAKER_04]: DTX Mania which is a sim and those type of things.

961
01:16:08,483 --> 01:16:25,628
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you want more information, first off, download the sims in the media shop on BomayiStyle and check out their session simulation forums on BomayiStyle as well for all your information on how to actually use those sim files and play around with them.

962
01:16:26,228 --> 01:16:26,788
[SPEAKER_04]: They're a lot of fun.

963
01:16:28,269 --> 01:16:29,209
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, very cool.

964
01:16:30,378 --> 01:16:32,479
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a news story that's in right now.

965
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:38,363
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't really necessarily relate to DDR completely, but I thought it was interesting because there's some games in here that are definitely worth mentioning.

966
01:16:38,843 --> 01:16:41,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Time Magazine has announced their top ten video games of the year.

967
01:16:41,885 --> 01:16:43,205
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys ready to hear this?

968
01:16:43,225 --> 01:16:44,826
[SPEAKER_03]: The top ten video... Uh-oh.

969
01:16:45,867 --> 01:16:46,787
[SPEAKER_03]: And sorry, guys.

970
01:16:47,147 --> 01:16:48,968
[SPEAKER_03]: DDR, not on it.

971
01:16:49,288 --> 01:16:50,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Karaoke, not on it.

972
01:16:50,809 --> 01:16:51,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Bomani, not on it.

973
01:16:52,030 --> 01:16:54,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Karaoke Revolution did win it last year, if I remember right.

974
01:16:54,611 --> 01:16:57,633
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I guess it's Bomani's turn to take a back...

975
01:16:58,410 --> 01:16:58,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Pirates

976
01:17:22,396 --> 01:17:23,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Army D, it's Pirates.

977
01:17:23,998 --> 01:17:24,999
What is that?

978
01:17:25,059 --> 01:17:27,202
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an adventure RPG game, and I believe it's on the PC.

979
01:17:27,222 --> 01:17:28,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think so.

980
01:17:29,504 --> 01:17:29,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Pirates.

981
01:17:30,045 --> 01:17:30,265
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

982
01:17:30,285 --> 01:17:31,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Not to be confused with Puzzle Pirates.

983
01:17:32,127 --> 01:17:35,010
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, not to be confused with Puzzle Pirates.

984
01:17:35,070 --> 01:17:39,615
[SPEAKER_03]: Number nine, Fable for the Xbox, that role-playing game.

985
01:17:39,635 --> 01:17:42,718
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the one where you can marry a guy in it, if you play the cards right.

986
01:17:43,999 --> 01:17:44,460
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty awesome.

987
01:17:45,253 --> 01:17:50,557
[SPEAKER_03]: Number 8, Burnout 3, Takedown, another racing and crashing game.

988
01:17:50,617 --> 01:17:52,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki's giving the thumbs up to that, any particular reason?

989
01:17:53,058 --> 01:17:56,620
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the first one was awesome, and this one looked really good, but I just have no interest in buying games.

990
01:17:58,722 --> 01:18:05,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Number 7, and I'm actually surprised it's kind of low because everybody in the gaming community has a huge boner about Halo 2.

991
01:18:05,899 --> 01:18:08,301
[SPEAKER_08]: Battlefield Vietnam, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas

992
01:18:31,858 --> 01:18:34,421
[SPEAKER_03]: If you haven't heard about Grand Theft Auto, it's time to come out of your hole.

993
01:18:53,028 --> 01:18:56,289
[SPEAKER_03]: So what rolled over Grand Theft Auto to land in fourth place?

994
01:18:56,670 --> 01:18:57,950
[SPEAKER_03]: Katamari Damacy.

995
01:18:58,070 --> 01:18:59,531
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay!

996
01:18:59,791 --> 01:19:01,891
[SPEAKER_03]: Number four, I know there's a lot of folks in here.

997
01:19:01,911 --> 01:19:03,792
[SPEAKER_08]: Best underground hit ever.

998
01:19:04,112 --> 01:19:08,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, it's the sleeper hit probably so far this decade.

999
01:19:08,754 --> 01:19:11,195
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, it's the biggest sleeper hit I've ever seen.

1000
01:19:12,475 --> 01:19:15,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Number three, a little game you might have heard of.

1001
01:19:15,558 --> 01:19:16,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Half-Life 2.

1002
01:19:17,179 --> 01:19:18,480
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you guys know the Half-Life.

1003
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:19,501
[SPEAKER_03]: You ever heard of Half-Life?

1004
01:19:19,721 --> 01:19:22,023
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think so.

1005
01:19:22,103 --> 01:19:23,484
[SPEAKER_08]: A long time ago, yeah.

1006
01:19:24,124 --> 01:19:30,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Number two, and always in magazines, there are these games that kind of come out of nowhere to land at number two.

1007
01:19:31,170 --> 01:19:35,793
[SPEAKER_03]: And in this case, it's a strategy game, and I'm sure strategy gamers out there are going to go, Sky, you idiot!

1008
01:19:37,274 --> 01:19:40,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Rome Total War is the name of the game.

1009
01:19:40,977 --> 01:19:41,578
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never heard of it.

1010
01:19:41,798 --> 01:19:42,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Cricket.

1011
01:19:42,558 --> 01:19:43,019
[SPEAKER_03]: Cricket, Cricket.

1012
01:19:43,039 --> 01:19:43,279
[SPEAKER_08]: Cricket.

1013
01:19:44,288 --> 01:19:45,369
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys are idiots!

1014
01:19:46,450 --> 01:19:48,091
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you mean you don't play strategy games?

1015
01:19:48,111 --> 01:19:49,372
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the best strategy game ever.

1016
01:19:49,693 --> 01:19:51,774
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so glad I don't have headphones right now.

1017
01:19:51,794 --> 01:19:53,295
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds so lame.

1018
01:19:54,376 --> 01:19:55,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Rome Total War.

1019
01:19:55,417 --> 01:19:55,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey!

1020
01:19:55,597 --> 01:19:59,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait a second, wasn't that that stupid game that Capcom was pushing or something?

1021
01:19:59,941 --> 01:20:06,566
[SPEAKER_04]: That was like some sort of, almost like Melgar Solid in Greek Roman times, you know?

1022
01:20:07,847 --> 01:20:08,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that the game?

1023
01:20:08,988 --> 01:20:10,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that one looked really lame.

1024
01:20:10,849 --> 01:20:13,071
[SPEAKER_04]: And every time I saw it on their big screen, I'd laugh at it.

1025
01:20:15,463 --> 01:20:17,465
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, you want to know what the number one game of the year is?

1026
01:20:17,485 --> 01:20:19,326
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, wait, I have to interrupt you real quick.

1027
01:20:19,346 --> 01:20:19,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1028
01:20:19,947 --> 01:20:21,708
[SPEAKER_08]: MidiHead has joined us in our chat room.

1029
01:20:22,008 --> 01:20:22,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

1030
01:20:22,629 --> 01:20:23,950
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1031
01:20:25,151 --> 01:20:25,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

1032
01:20:25,851 --> 01:20:27,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, welcome, MidiHead, to join in the chat there.

1033
01:20:28,893 --> 01:20:32,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Go give him the same praise you were giving earlier while that song was playing, honestly.

1034
01:20:32,756 --> 01:20:34,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Inflate his ego a little more, please.

1035
01:20:35,378 --> 01:20:37,900
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure we'll send you a check for that.

1036
01:20:38,781 --> 01:20:40,562
[SPEAKER_03]: You can send us a check for that later.

1037
01:20:40,642 --> 01:20:40,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1038
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:44,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Number one.

1039
01:20:44,420 --> 01:20:46,521
[SPEAKER_03]: The number one game of the year according to Time Magazine.

1040
01:20:46,681 --> 01:20:49,042
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think Loki could possibly agree with this one.

1041
01:20:49,062 --> 01:20:49,582
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure.

1042
01:20:49,662 --> 01:20:52,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Based on the murder simulation he has created in.

1043
01:20:52,382 --> 01:20:53,043
[SPEAKER_03]: The Sims 2.

1044
01:20:53,223 --> 01:20:58,924
[SPEAKER_06]: That I'll actually give the number one rating to because at E3 that just was phenomenal.

1045
01:20:59,264 --> 01:21:00,485
[SPEAKER_04]: What is coming out for The Sims 2?

1046
01:21:00,785 --> 01:21:05,626
[SPEAKER_04]: But not only the first expansion pack where The Sims go to college.

1047
01:21:07,166 --> 01:21:08,227
[SPEAKER_04]: I kid you not.

1048
01:21:08,287 --> 01:21:09,227
[SPEAKER_04]: They go to college.

1049
01:21:09,447 --> 01:21:11,428
[SPEAKER_04]: They join in on spring break.

1050
01:21:11,588 --> 01:21:12,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Frat parties.

1051
01:21:12,628 --> 01:21:12,988
[SPEAKER_04]: It is

1052
01:21:14,335 --> 01:21:14,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

1053
01:21:14,675 --> 01:21:17,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Sims 2 going to school.

1054
01:21:19,762 --> 01:21:21,304
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we get to get Sims drunk now?

1055
01:21:22,225 --> 01:21:25,709
[SPEAKER_03]: I just... How many expansion packs are they going to make for this Sims game, honestly?

1056
01:21:25,809 --> 01:21:31,336
[SPEAKER_06]: How many did they do for... I'm waiting for like the adult Ed Powers version.

1057
01:21:31,997 --> 01:21:32,818
[SPEAKER_06]: The hardcore...

1058
01:21:35,219 --> 01:21:40,323
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that'd be Playboy, the mansion game, you know, where you manage the Playboy mansion.

1059
01:21:40,343 --> 01:21:41,123
[SPEAKER_04]: That looks horrible.

1060
01:21:41,263 --> 01:21:45,647
[SPEAKER_04]: And just, like, watch chicks run around naked that are, like, stupid looking.

1061
01:21:46,167 --> 01:21:53,692
[SPEAKER_04]: That's about as fun as Leisure Suit Larry, the new one, which I beat, and I gotta say, it was kind of lame.

1062
01:21:54,273 --> 01:21:55,114
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kind of lame.

1063
01:21:56,394 --> 01:21:58,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, was it at least enjoyable?

1064
01:21:59,937 --> 01:22:02,479
[SPEAKER_04]: It was enjoyable after I took the censorship off.

1065
01:22:05,476 --> 01:22:13,841
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to love any game, though, that allows you to be a sperm trying to make it through, you know, and avoiding, you know, different blocks to try to make it through the egg.

1066
01:22:14,382 --> 01:22:15,022
[SPEAKER_06]: That was pretty funny.

1067
01:22:15,222 --> 01:22:19,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

1068
01:22:19,265 --> 01:22:23,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Any overlooked games, you guys think, for the top ten of the year?

1069
01:22:24,268 --> 01:22:25,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Besides Ultramix 2.

1070
01:22:26,670 --> 01:22:32,434
[SPEAKER_06]: God, you know, it's good Katamari made it because otherwise I would have been like, what?! !

1071
01:22:33,726 --> 01:22:36,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Metal Gear Solid 3.

1072
01:22:37,969 --> 01:22:39,930
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm actually a little bit surprised.

1073
01:22:41,051 --> 01:22:46,354
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm wondering if it was because the release date was so late that something such as Smackdown vs. Raw wouldn't have made it.

1074
01:22:46,874 --> 01:22:49,456
[SPEAKER_08]: Just because, I mean, it's amazing.

1075
01:22:49,576 --> 01:22:51,077
[SPEAKER_08]: It is utterly amazing.

1076
01:22:51,257 --> 01:22:51,677
[SPEAKER_08]: F that!

1077
01:22:51,757 --> 01:22:52,718
[SPEAKER_25]: Rumble Roses!

1078
01:22:52,858 --> 01:22:54,259
[SPEAKER_25]: Where's my Rumble Roses?

1079
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:58,522
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but you have to admit that the playthrough mode, the...

1080
01:22:59,342 --> 01:23:27,995
[SPEAKER_04]: The Story Mode Oh my god, that's horrible Even Sigurd agrees with me in chat there Rumble Roses was far overlooked It was, but that, you know The Story Mode is just Although the game is getting horrible reviews Oh come on Oh sure, they give, you know, DOA Beach Volleyball good reviews But no, this one actually has gameplay Oh, it's interrupting my watching them walk around Dammit I actually have to play this one?

1081
01:23:28,795 --> 01:23:29,495
[SPEAKER_06]: That sucks!

1082
01:23:29,796 --> 01:23:31,516
[SPEAKER_06]: It's interrupting the jiggle scenes, dammit.

1083
01:23:31,957 --> 01:23:38,280
[SPEAKER_04]: They should have DOA versus Rumble Roses and just like one all-naked-fest mud-wrestling game.

1084
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:38,920
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1085
01:23:39,060 --> 01:23:39,580
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1086
01:23:39,740 --> 01:23:40,621
[SPEAKER_04]: I totally agree.

1087
01:23:40,861 --> 01:23:45,423
[SPEAKER_08]: Not enough nakedness in games, I guess.

1088
01:23:45,503 --> 01:23:46,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Where was the guy game?

1089
01:23:48,689 --> 01:23:50,210
[SPEAKER_03]: I have never played the guy game.

1090
01:23:50,230 --> 01:23:51,331
[SPEAKER_03]: I've only heard about this game.

1091
01:23:51,351 --> 01:23:52,251
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you played the guy game?

1092
01:23:52,271 --> 01:23:54,153
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I have to admit, I did rent it.

1093
01:23:54,553 --> 01:23:55,934
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell is up with the guy game?

1094
01:23:55,954 --> 01:23:57,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell me about the guy game.

1095
01:23:57,315 --> 01:24:05,880
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, the guy game was apparently filmed spring break last year at some place in Texas where they were just basically asking women trivia questions.

1096
01:24:05,980 --> 01:24:07,742
[SPEAKER_06]: And these women are dumb as rocks.

1097
01:24:08,802 --> 01:24:09,663
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, let's be honest here.

1098
01:24:10,563 --> 01:24:16,047
[SPEAKER_06]: And the first part of the game is to see which one of the four players will get it right.

1099
01:24:16,147 --> 01:24:17,528
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the second part is

1100
01:24:18,447 --> 01:24:20,508
[SPEAKER_06]: to figure out if the girl's going to get it right.

1101
01:24:21,109 --> 01:24:25,251
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you figure that she's going to get it right or wrong... Well, the girl's never going to get it right!

1102
01:24:25,391 --> 01:24:26,192
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kidding, I'm kidding.

1103
01:24:26,372 --> 01:24:28,313
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, there's a few that actually do, and it's kind of scary.

1104
01:24:28,333 --> 01:24:28,933
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

1105
01:24:28,953 --> 01:24:31,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't that stolen from Howard Stern?

1106
01:24:31,955 --> 01:24:33,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Or like some other talk show?

1107
01:24:33,356 --> 01:24:36,918
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I know this has been stolen on numerous talk shows.

1108
01:24:36,958 --> 01:24:43,902
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it obviously has, but there's this little meter that goes up, and at first it starts off, you know, if they get it wrong, they have to flash their tits.

1109
01:24:44,383 --> 01:24:46,384
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it first starts off... Jesus Christ!

1110
01:24:47,134 --> 01:24:52,916
[SPEAKER_06]: So it first starts off with them flashing and it has the guy game logo across their chest.

1111
01:24:53,456 --> 01:24:59,318
[SPEAKER_06]: You get the level up a little bit higher and all of a sudden the logo disappears but their boobies are pixelated.

1112
01:25:00,018 --> 01:25:00,838
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's kind of fuzzy.

1113
01:25:01,298 --> 01:25:04,199
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you get to the last level where it's totally uncensored.

1114
01:25:05,559 --> 01:25:11,321
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can replay the level and see all these girls topless and it's just kind of

1115
01:25:12,685 --> 01:25:16,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Head Scratching, you know, mind-boggling, just what the hell are they thinking?

1116
01:25:16,787 --> 01:25:18,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Like BMX XXX?

1117
01:25:19,128 --> 01:25:23,430
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I have that game, and I can't play it because it gives me, like, motion sickness.

1118
01:25:23,950 --> 01:25:24,771
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that game.

1119
01:25:25,531 --> 01:25:27,732
[SPEAKER_04]: And the movies are awesome in it.

1120
01:25:27,792 --> 01:25:29,333
[SPEAKER_04]: The final movies kick ass.

1121
01:25:29,353 --> 01:25:30,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I have to admit that.

1122
01:25:30,293 --> 01:25:32,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Asian schoolgirl stripping.

1123
01:25:34,615 --> 01:25:37,177
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm surprised that this game isn't still number one today.

1124
01:25:39,230 --> 01:25:40,092
[SPEAKER_06]: But no, the guy game.

1125
01:25:40,193 --> 01:25:40,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my goodness.

1126
01:25:40,754 --> 01:25:41,777
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I'm shocked.

1127
01:25:41,837 --> 01:25:44,243
[SPEAKER_03]: The guy game is not the number one game of the year.

1128
01:25:44,523 --> 01:25:45,225
[SPEAKER_03]: So, shocked.

1129
01:25:48,576 --> 01:25:50,697
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, I think now's a good time to call it a break.

1130
01:25:51,057 --> 01:25:51,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Go on, girl.

1131
01:25:51,477 --> 01:25:55,838
[SPEAKER_03]: I notice you're purposefully quiet over there during discussions with the guy game.

1132
01:25:56,158 --> 01:25:58,038
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just telling Middyhead goodbye.

1133
01:25:58,638 --> 01:25:59,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, he left?

1134
01:25:59,159 --> 01:26:00,079
[SPEAKER_03]: He took off?

1135
01:26:00,099 --> 01:26:01,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Did our chat room scare him off?

1136
01:26:01,539 --> 01:26:04,400
[SPEAKER_08]: I was being all nice to your guests and everything.

1137
01:26:04,940 --> 01:26:11,522
[SPEAKER_03]: All I know is I looked in the chat room and somebody said that they were jizzing their pants when they listened to the Middyhead song and I'm just like, I better not read anymore.

1138
01:26:12,942 --> 01:26:14,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, I better not read anymore.

1139
01:26:15,703 --> 01:26:16,623
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I love our listeners.

1140
01:26:16,803 --> 01:26:17,223
[SPEAKER_03]: They're great.

1141
01:26:17,557 --> 01:26:17,977
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

1142
01:26:40,916 --> 01:26:41,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki is Crying

1143
01:27:09,127 --> 01:27:10,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Find out when we come back.

1144
01:27:13,251 --> 01:27:14,812
[SPEAKER_03]: 2DX11 music coming your way.

1145
01:27:15,112 --> 01:27:15,553
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be back.

1146
01:27:15,653 --> 01:27:16,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Or 2DX Red, I should say.

1147
01:27:17,955 --> 01:27:18,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, fanboys.

1148
01:27:43,886 --> 01:27:44,366
Thanks for watching!

1149
01:28:12,202 --> 01:28:12,902

[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for watching!

[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio With the Ping Pong Ball

1155
01:33:52,119 --> 01:33:54,520
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, Middy had actually sent me an email during the break there.

1156
01:33:54,820 --> 01:33:58,162
[SPEAKER_03]: And he wants you guys to know that, yes, that was him singing in that song.

1157
01:33:58,242 --> 01:33:59,003
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, wow.

1158
01:33:59,023 --> 01:34:01,604
[SPEAKER_03]: For those of you guys that wanted to know if that was his voice, yes, that was him singing.

1159
01:34:02,064 --> 01:34:02,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Very impressed.

1160
01:34:02,965 --> 01:34:05,766
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's sending me a new song of his to play.

1161
01:34:05,906 --> 01:34:06,647
[SPEAKER_16]: Very cool.

1162
01:34:06,847 --> 01:34:08,908
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll be playing that at the end of the show.

1163
01:34:08,928 --> 01:34:09,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking forward to that.

1164

1166
01:34:16,512 --> 01:34:17,592
[SPEAKER_03]: You get a second chance.

1167
01:34:17,712 --> 01:34:18,793
[SPEAKER_03]: You get second helpings.

1168
01:34:19,446 --> 01:34:28,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks to DDR Freak Radio, who's going to be rebroadcasting it on December 10th, 6 o'clock, as they do every Friday night, our little show over there.

1169
01:34:28,508 --> 01:34:30,029
[SPEAKER_08]: Orange Lounge Radio Rewind.

1170
01:34:30,149 --> 01:34:31,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, so, very cool.

1171
01:34:31,689 --> 01:34:37,330
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, some of you guys may be thinking, well, didn't you guys used to do the rewinds on your own damn station, Sky?

1172
01:34:37,991 --> 01:34:44,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, actually, that's true, but now it is the oldie and moldie Wednesday flashback, where we are 100 episodes behind right now.

1173
01:34:44,392 --> 01:34:46,173
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can hear what the show sounded like two years ago.

1174
01:34:46,733 --> 01:34:47,393
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty nuts.

1175
01:34:47,413 --> 01:34:47,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

1176
01:34:48,713 --> 01:34:58,819
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of looked at the chat and some of the response to last week's episode, and I think Misty or somebody had said, it's a good thing I wasn't there, because I would have ripped him a new asshole.

1177
01:34:59,179 --> 01:35:06,003
[SPEAKER_03]: So hear what offensive things you missed out on, back on episodes 20 and 21 and all that stuff we're playing way back when, so check it out.

1178
01:35:07,463 --> 01:35:09,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so we're going to get to our...

1179
01:35:11,164 --> 01:35:14,088
[SPEAKER_03]: are not a cage match, but something a little different in a little bit.

1180
01:35:14,368 --> 01:35:17,192
[SPEAKER_03]: But I wanted to talk first about Taiko Drum Master.

1181
01:35:17,793 --> 01:35:20,216
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a game that kind of came out there under our noses.

1182
01:35:20,256 --> 01:35:23,120
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we got to check it out at E3, and we told you guys a little bit about it.

1183
01:35:23,959 --> 01:35:26,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Huge game in Japan called Taiko no Tachijin in Japan.

1184
01:35:27,502 --> 01:35:30,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, for those who don't know what it's about, it's about Taiko drumming.

1185
01:35:30,824 --> 01:35:34,087
[SPEAKER_03]: You have these big things that look like breadsticks, and you beat the drum.

1186
01:35:34,147 --> 01:35:35,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Either you beat it in the center or you beat it in the side.

1187
01:35:36,249 --> 01:35:43,014
[SPEAKER_03]: And so popular in Japan, it was the number one selling game in Japan for a while, that they decided to bring it over to the U.S., call it Taiko Drum Master.

1188
01:35:43,414 --> 01:35:45,756
[SPEAKER_03]: And Iguana Girl, you guys actually picked up a copy of it, right?

1189
01:35:45,936 --> 01:35:49,920
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, we purchased a copy over at our local Fry's Electronics for 60 bucks.

1190
01:35:50,640 --> 01:35:51,041
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

1191
01:36:07,270 --> 01:36:08,011
[SPEAKER_08]: Na, na, na, na, na, na

1192
01:36:25,607 --> 01:36:26,167
[SPEAKER_02]: and so on.

1193
01:36:51,388 --> 01:37:00,093
[SPEAKER_03]: by the way, I just want to talk about how scary it was that we all burst into song on the Katamari Damashii record a little bit scary there the song is a stroke of genius

1194
01:37:06,861 --> 01:37:10,123
[SPEAKER_08]: Those were some songs that we actually got to play at E3.

1195
01:37:11,304 --> 01:37:16,067
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, that was on the Taika No Tatooine original setup.

1196
01:37:16,507 --> 01:37:18,448
[SPEAKER_08]: But it was more like the crossover.

1197
01:37:18,628 --> 01:37:20,830
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the E3 version of the American game.

1198
01:37:22,331 --> 01:37:23,911
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, the music list is pretty decent.

1199
01:37:25,252 --> 01:37:27,033
[SPEAKER_08]: We've only managed to get 31 songs.

1200
01:37:27,073 --> 01:37:28,214
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if there's further.

1201
01:37:28,594 --> 01:37:29,535
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's the max.

1202
01:37:29,595 --> 01:37:31,356
[SPEAKER_08]: We have unlocked the Oni mode.

1203
01:37:32,056 --> 01:37:32,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Oni Mode.

1204
01:37:32,656 --> 01:37:33,477
[SPEAKER_03]: It is Oni Mode.

1205
01:37:33,517 --> 01:37:42,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I have to ask, or else Rice Princess and Lanky Style would kill me because this is an inside joke from outside the box, but My Sharona is in the game, correct?

1206
01:37:42,621 --> 01:37:42,881
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1207
01:37:43,421 --> 01:37:44,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, just double check.

1208
01:37:44,642 --> 01:37:45,602
[SPEAKER_03]: It is in the game.

1209
01:37:45,682 --> 01:37:46,642
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1210
01:37:46,823 --> 01:37:50,264
[SPEAKER_08]: There's also, wasn't Love Shack in that?

1211
01:37:50,424 --> 01:37:50,624
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1212
01:37:50,684 --> 01:37:52,125
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1213
01:37:52,145 --> 01:37:53,766
[SPEAKER_08]: Love Shack is also in that game.

1214
01:37:53,986 --> 01:37:54,706
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that song.

1215
01:37:54,926 --> 01:37:55,666
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1216
01:37:55,806 --> 01:37:56,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

1217
01:37:56,067 --> 01:37:57,047
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1218
01:37:57,876 --> 01:37:59,137
[SPEAKER_08]: Stuff like ABC.

1219
01:37:59,558 --> 01:38:00,579
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you going to be my girl?

1220
01:38:00,779 --> 01:38:01,880
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's Ross' favorite.

1221
01:38:01,900 --> 01:38:03,521
[SPEAKER_06]: That one's a lot of fun.

1222
01:38:03,561 --> 01:38:04,202
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of fun.

1223
01:38:08,129 --> 01:38:10,651
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a Queen song in there, Killer Queen.

1224
01:38:10,671 --> 01:38:17,698
[SPEAKER_06]: There's all sorts of songs from Namco's own games, like the theme song from Soul Calibur, Ridge Racer.

1225
01:38:17,738 --> 01:38:23,042
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember that the Soul Calibur song, whatever it's called, was one of the stages.

1226
01:38:23,303 --> 01:38:25,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Brave Sword, Braver Soul, yeah, whatever.

1227
01:38:26,065 --> 01:38:26,646
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's cool.

1228
01:38:26,766 --> 01:38:29,448
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, it's a good overall mix of music.

1229
01:38:29,488 --> 01:38:32,871
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, they've got a lot of American songs mixed in with...

1230
01:38:34,993 --> 01:38:39,298
[SPEAKER_08]: Mixed in with the classical stuff and with their own versions of stuff.

1231
01:38:39,318 --> 01:38:42,421
[SPEAKER_08]: Like they have Taiko March and stuff like that.

1232
01:38:42,501 --> 01:38:48,246
[SPEAKER_03]: So do you think that the kids that are upset that there's been no US Beatmania as of yet, do you think that this might hold them over a little bit?

1233
01:38:50,108 --> 01:38:50,789
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe.

1234
01:38:51,710 --> 01:38:53,031
[SPEAKER_08]: It's more like the...

1235
01:38:55,379 --> 01:39:00,183
[SPEAKER_08]: If you were to get this and Donkey Konga, then you've got your whole drum mania thing worked out right there.

1236
01:39:00,203 --> 01:39:01,705
[SPEAKER_03]: This is more like a drum mania.

1237
01:39:02,145 --> 01:39:11,374
[SPEAKER_08]: That's another ironic bit is that the classical stuff that is in Donkey Konga is the same stuff that's in Taiko Drum Masters.

1238
01:39:11,474 --> 01:39:17,339
[SPEAKER_08]: So you could either choose to play the stuff on the bongos or on the Taiko drums.

1239
01:39:18,260 --> 01:39:19,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Just all up to you.

1240
01:39:19,621 --> 01:39:20,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Something for everyone.

1241
01:39:21,082 --> 01:39:24,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Except Katamari on the rocks is not in Donkey Kong.

1242
01:39:24,964 --> 01:39:25,604
[SPEAKER_03]: That's too bad.

1243
01:39:26,304 --> 01:39:26,625
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1244
01:39:27,385 --> 01:39:28,145
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, guys.

1245
01:39:28,485 --> 01:39:30,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have everything set up over here that we need?

1246
01:39:31,367 --> 01:39:31,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki?

1247
01:39:32,007 --> 01:39:32,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Is something wrong?

1248
01:39:36,049 --> 01:39:37,349
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, he's saying the webcam.

1249
01:39:37,369 --> 01:39:38,710
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care about the webcam.

1250
01:39:38,750 --> 01:39:39,850
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got to get the other stuff, though.

1251
01:39:40,511 --> 01:39:43,472
[SPEAKER_03]: We are going to get to tonight's cage match, boys and girls.

1252
01:39:43,592 --> 01:39:45,853
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time for your favorite segment of the show.

1253
01:39:45,913 --> 01:39:48,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, maybe not, but it is the mandatory segment we do every week.

1254
01:39:49,804 --> 01:39:59,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Cage Match, where we pitch three songs against each other, head-to-head, and we see who the winner is.

1255
01:39:59,569 --> 01:40:09,775
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys vote, and your favorite song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's 24-hour-a-day, 7-days-a-week, Bomani Music and More program.

1256
01:40:10,275 --> 01:40:15,178
[SPEAKER_03]: So, let's see, last week's winner was a little song here.

1257
01:40:15,638 --> 01:40:19,280
[SPEAKER_03]: It was actually a Top 40 song that's won the contest for a couple weeks now.

1258
01:40:20,157 --> 01:40:21,578
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been winning for a little while now.

1259
01:40:22,139 --> 01:40:26,963
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's called... It's by Gwen Stefani.

1260
01:40:28,064 --> 01:40:33,529
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm trying to... Yep, What You Waiting For is the song.

1261
01:40:33,869 --> 01:40:37,052
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a clip of last week's winner, What You Waiting For.

1262
01:40:57,250 --> 01:40:58,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that was enough of a clip.

1263
01:40:59,753 --> 01:41:05,761
[SPEAKER_03]: So, the question is, do we do another cage match tonight without DarkSakura present?

1264
01:41:07,102 --> 01:41:09,264
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, a standard normal cage match.

1265
01:41:09,484 --> 01:41:13,066
[SPEAKER_03]: No, unfortunately, we will not be doing a normal cage match tonight.

1266
01:41:13,247 --> 01:41:15,448
[SPEAKER_03]: So Gwen Stefani wins another week by default.

1267
01:41:15,728 --> 01:41:19,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if we did a cage match without DarkSakura, there'd be hell to pay.

1268
01:41:20,152 --> 01:41:23,694
[SPEAKER_25]: There'll be hell to pay.

1269
01:41:23,714 --> 01:41:24,835
[SPEAKER_03]: There'll be other hell to pay.

1270
01:41:25,055 --> 01:41:28,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead of pissing off Jamie, we're going to piss off Loki.

1271
01:41:28,818 --> 01:41:30,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Because pissing off Loki is funnier.

1272
01:41:32,701 --> 01:41:35,283
[SPEAKER_03]: By doing a... Drumroll, please.

1273
01:41:37,611 --> 01:41:39,572
[SPEAKER_25]: Karaoke Cage Match!

1274
01:41:42,513 --> 01:41:46,234
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright guys, here's the way the Karaoke Cage Match is going to work.

1275
01:41:47,435 --> 01:41:58,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like the typical Cage Match, where there's going to be three songs that you're going to get to pick from, and the favorite that you pick will go into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio, just like any other song, alright?

1276
01:41:59,960 --> 01:42:02,601
[SPEAKER_03]: But the deal is, is that instead of...

1277
01:42:03,274 --> 01:42:08,877
[SPEAKER_03]: It being songs that are out there, you know, and like just songs that we pick out of the blue like we usually do.

1278
01:42:09,377 --> 01:42:15,240
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll be songs sung by folks in the studio tonight via Karaoke Revolution Volume 3.

1279
01:42:16,941 --> 01:42:19,142
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a good way for us to check out this game as well.

1280
01:42:20,543 --> 01:42:21,964
[SPEAKER_03]: So now you see why Loki's pissed.

1281
01:42:23,024 --> 01:42:24,385
[SPEAKER_03]: He bathed me all night.

1282
01:42:24,585 --> 01:42:25,686
[SPEAKER_03]: He bathed me all night.

1283
01:42:25,706 --> 01:42:26,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Do not do this segment.

1284
01:42:26,946 --> 01:42:28,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Do not do the damn segment.

1285
01:42:28,227 --> 01:42:29,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Do not do the damn segment.

1286
01:42:30,368 --> 01:42:31,049
[SPEAKER_13]: Too bad.

1287
01:42:32,458 --> 01:42:35,339
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, so who's going to start off tonight?

1288
01:42:35,499 --> 01:42:36,179
[SPEAKER_25]: Me and you?

1289
01:42:36,459 --> 01:42:37,600
[SPEAKER_25]: You want to start off?

1290
01:42:37,900 --> 01:42:39,180
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, let's start it off.

1291
01:42:39,200 --> 01:42:39,860
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to start off.

1292
01:42:39,900 --> 01:42:46,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we're going to go over to Karaoke Revolution Volume 3, and I'm going to give the mic to Loki so he can vent a little bit of his anger while we set up for song number one.

1293
01:42:46,842 --> 01:42:49,463
[SPEAKER_04]: The hell with all you people, I should have never bought that damn game.

1294
01:42:50,544 --> 01:42:51,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck my girlfriend.

1295
01:42:51,924 --> 01:42:52,204
[SPEAKER_13]: I know.

1296
01:42:52,224 --> 01:42:52,804
[SPEAKER_13]: God damn it.

1297
01:43:02,921 --> 01:43:04,522
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like this game very much.

1298
01:43:05,242 --> 01:43:05,943
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

1299
01:43:06,023 --> 01:43:08,044
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, what do we got?

1300
01:43:08,084 --> 01:43:11,726
[SPEAKER_13]: So what are you going to play?

1301
01:43:11,886 --> 01:43:13,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Indian Herbal Bowl!

1302
01:43:18,090 --> 01:43:18,991
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Love Shack in a duet.

1303
01:43:32,639 --> 01:43:34,820
[SPEAKER_03]: Juanagor and I are going to do Love Shack.

1304
01:43:34,900 --> 01:43:38,163
[SPEAKER_03]: So is it going to pick up over the mics here, or do we need to have the mic nearby?

1305
01:43:38,403 --> 01:43:39,523
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll pick up over the mics.

1306
01:43:40,644 --> 01:43:43,066
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it'll pick up over the mics.

1307
01:43:44,166 --> 01:43:46,548
[SPEAKER_13]: I love karaoke revolution.

1308
01:43:46,568 --> 01:43:47,969
[SPEAKER_14]: I dislike this game.

1309
01:44:01,914 --> 01:44:05,836
[SPEAKER_03]: If you see a faded sign at the side of the road that says 15 miles to the south

1310
01:44:28,775 --> 01:44:30,400
Love Shack, yeah, yeah

[SPEAKER_06]: That was a good performance.

1347
01:49:43,487 --> 01:49:44,408
[SPEAKER_25]: And on a scale of 1 to 10?

1348
01:49:47,311 --> 01:49:47,671
[SPEAKER_06]: 7.5 to 8.

1349
01:49:48,512 --> 01:49:48,892
[SPEAKER_19]: Loki.

01:49:49,873 --> 01:49:53,116
[SPEAKER_19]: I give it a 0 because this was the dumbest fucking Sigma ever.

01:49:54,352 --> 01:49:54,953
[SPEAKER_13]: What the hell with you?

1352
01:49:55,053 --> 01:49:58,716
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm never letting you run a show ever again by yourself.

1354
01:50:01,439 --> 01:50:02,039

[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, let's split it first.

1360
01:50:23,004 --> 01:50:27,806
[SPEAKER_17]: Hey, what the hell is up with Granny?

1361
01:50:27,826 --> 01:50:28,746
[SPEAKER_13]: Granny's rocking.

1362

01:50:31,227 --> 01:50:32,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Islander's next.

1364
01:50:32,527 --> 01:50:34,028
[SPEAKER_02]: What song are you going to sing for us, Islander?

1365
01:50:34,368 --> 01:50:35,829
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh lord, let me take a look at the list here.

1366
01:50:35,849 --> 01:50:36,589
[SPEAKER_25]: Uh-oh.

1367
01:50:38,329 --> 01:50:39,050
[SPEAKER_25]: Not that list.

1368
01:50:39,150 --> 01:50:39,490
[SPEAKER_25]: Wrong.

1369
01:50:40,630 --> 01:50:41,391
[SPEAKER_25]: Let's try this again.

1370
01:50:41,611 --> 01:50:44,572
I do not sing well.

1371
01:50:44,632 --> 01:50:48,133
I do not like...

1372
01:50:57,383 --> 01:51:00,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, he's going through and finding his song right now, what he wants to sing.

1373
01:51:03,404 --> 01:51:08,525
[SPEAKER_02]: He was thinking about the Fugees, but passed on it.

1374
01:51:12,166 --> 01:51:12,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe Dido?

1375
01:51:13,926 --> 01:51:14,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Hoobastank!

1376
01:51:15,407 --> 01:51:15,607
[SPEAKER_02]: No?

1377
01:51:18,567 --> 01:51:19,067
[SPEAKER_02]: ABC.

1378
01:51:21,768 --> 01:51:22,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Against All Odds is in there.

1379
01:51:23,268 --> 01:51:24,488
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys know that one from DDR.

1380
01:51:25,889 --> 01:51:27,069
[SPEAKER_02]: He's thinking about Hoobastank.

1381
01:51:29,299 --> 01:51:31,101
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, he's giving his nod.

1382
01:51:31,621 --> 01:51:32,462
[SPEAKER_02]: And he hit the X button.

1383
01:51:32,622 --> 01:51:33,342
[SPEAKER_02]: He's stuck with it now.

1384
01:51:33,682 --> 01:51:43,490
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Islander, song number two in tonight's cage match.

1385
01:51:44,390 --> 01:51:45,832
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, song number two in tonight's cage match.

1386
01:51:46,352 --> 01:51:48,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Islander, The Reason.

1387
01:51:48,914 --> 01:51:54,638
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish this was volume one, because in that song I could do... Oh, hell, what the hell was it?

1388
01:51:54,658 --> 01:51:55,379
[SPEAKER_06]: From Vertical Horizons?

1389
01:52:06,307 --> 01:52:15,070
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not a perfect person There's many things I wish I didn't do But could I continue to

1390
01:52:27,894 --> 01:52:41,121
[SPEAKER_13]: I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know I found a reason for me To change who I am

1391
01:52:56,127 --> 01:53:06,572
[SPEAKER_13]: The reason to start over new And the reason is you It's only that I hurt you It's lost in a much deeper day

1392
01:53:19,925 --> 01:53:31,894
[SPEAKER_13]: And all the pain I put you through I wish that I could take it all away And be the one who catches all your tears That's why I needed to hear I found a reason for me

1393
01:53:48,067 --> 01:53:58,135
It changed who I used to be A reason to start over new And the reason is you And the reason is you

1394
01:54:14,150 --> 01:54:15,691
I'm not a perfect person

1395
01:54:35,477 --> 01:54:48,524
[SPEAKER_13]: I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know I found a reason for me To stay who I used to be

1396
01:55:02,851 --> 01:55:03,812
Thank you for watching!

1397
01:55:21,285 --> 01:55:24,386
All the girls there are swooning for

1398
01:55:46,545 --> 01:55:47,025
[SPEAKER_25]: Islander.

1399
01:55:47,105 --> 01:55:50,186
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, I know that was painful for a lot of people to listen to because it was painful for me to sing.

1400
01:55:50,446 --> 01:55:50,787
[SPEAKER_25]: That's right.

1401
01:55:51,047 --> 01:55:53,607
[SPEAKER_25]: Let's hear, let's go around and see what everybody thought of that.

1402
01:55:53,647 --> 01:55:54,108
[SPEAKER_25]: Iguana Girl.

1403
01:55:55,268 --> 01:55:56,128
[SPEAKER_13]: I still love you.

1404
01:55:56,809 --> 01:55:57,509
[SPEAKER_13]: It's okay.

1405
01:55:57,549 --> 01:55:58,049
[SPEAKER_25]: Yay.

1406
01:55:59,389 --> 01:56:01,590
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, it was a little quiet, but I dug it.

1407
01:56:02,370 --> 01:56:05,312
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, I think you would get girls throwing their panties at you any day.

1408
01:56:05,632 --> 01:56:10,533
[SPEAKER_03]: So I give it, maybe tonight if you're lucky, I give it a seven.

1409
01:56:12,834 --> 01:56:13,174
[SPEAKER_19]: Loki.

1410
01:56:13,954 --> 01:56:15,295
[SPEAKER_19]: I give a little finger up to Robb.

1411
01:56:17,341 --> 01:56:17,862
[SPEAKER_19]: That is it.

1412
01:56:18,823 --> 01:56:19,844
[SPEAKER_19]: That wasn't painful.

1413
01:56:20,744 --> 01:56:21,946
[SPEAKER_19]: Just give it a couple more minutes.

1414
01:56:24,388 --> 01:56:25,149
[SPEAKER_19]: I fucking hate this.

1415
01:56:25,369 --> 01:56:25,789
[SPEAKER_19]: Angel.

1416
01:56:26,630 --> 01:56:27,932
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, uh, that was really good.

1417
01:56:28,412 --> 01:56:35,139
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I'm gonna give it an 8 just cause I can, well, I don't have anything to say besides it was good.

1418
01:56:35,679 --> 01:56:39,203
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, there was a couple parts that, you know,

1419
01:56:41,217 --> 01:56:44,620
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1420
01:56:45,160 --> 01:56:45,861
[SPEAKER_25]: All right, Loki.

1421
01:56:46,361 --> 01:56:47,842
[SPEAKER_25]: What song is Loki going to sing?

1422
01:56:48,062 --> 01:56:48,723
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1423
01:56:49,643 --> 01:56:49,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh?

1424
01:56:49,924 --> 01:56:50,404
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1425
01:56:50,424 --> 01:56:50,744
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

1426
01:56:50,784 --> 01:56:51,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Exquisite.

1427
01:56:51,485 --> 01:56:52,946
[SPEAKER_03]: When he walked in, he was tardy.

1428
01:56:53,066 --> 01:56:53,506
[SPEAKER_03]: What can you do?

1429
01:56:53,706 --> 01:56:53,926
[SPEAKER_18]: I know.

1430
01:56:53,986 --> 01:56:54,447
[SPEAKER_18]: I know.

[SPEAKER_18]: Well, a mystic judge from Simon's view.

1432
01:56:59,092 --> 01:57:01,554
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't wanna fuckin' play this!

1433
01:57:02,174 --> 01:57:07,177
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, you did choke on some parts, but... Goddammit.

1434
01:57:07,517 --> 01:57:08,878
[SPEAKER_18]: Give it a 7.5.

1435
01:57:08,998 --> 01:57:09,918
[SPEAKER_18]: 7.5, alright.

1436
01:57:10,178 --> 01:57:10,679
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright!

1437
01:57:11,359 --> 01:57:14,781
[SPEAKER_25]: Here comes Loki, and he's so excited to be performing for you guys tonight.

1438
01:57:16,442 --> 01:57:17,822
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm gonna kill you in your sleep!

1439
01:57:20,864 --> 01:57:21,985
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm so excited about this.

1440
01:57:22,545 --> 01:57:25,727
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, let's see here, what's a shitty- This mic is, like, really bad.

1441
01:57:28,760 --> 01:57:31,421
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the song I like, which I will not be singing it.

1442
01:57:32,961 --> 01:57:34,442
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I will not be singing it.

1443
01:57:37,502 --> 01:57:40,983
[SPEAKER_04]: I really wish that we had Snake Eater unlocked, because at least that song would be fun.

1444
01:58:00,873 --> 01:58:02,615
[SPEAKER_13]: See, that's why I like you.

1445
01:58:02,695 --> 01:58:04,156
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why I like you.

1446
01:58:04,276 --> 01:58:06,098
[SPEAKER_13]: As he passes, oops, I did it again.

1447
01:58:06,158 --> 01:58:10,762
[SPEAKER_05]: As the whole room cheers, I'm gonna fucking kill you.

1448
01:58:11,543 --> 01:58:13,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki's gonna do oops, I did it again.

1449
01:58:13,524 --> 01:58:14,425
[SPEAKER_13]: Come on.

1450
01:58:14,465 --> 01:58:19,690
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, Loki, Loki, Loki, Loki, Loki.

1451
01:58:26,527 --> 01:58:29,289
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, they do not feel bad.

1452
01:58:29,309 --> 01:58:32,110
[SPEAKER_25]: They just wanted to hear the goddamn clip being played over and over again.

1453
01:58:32,250 --> 01:58:34,412
[SPEAKER_25]: Listen, it wasn't funny the second time we tried it.

1454
01:58:34,732 --> 01:58:37,093
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not going to be funny the third time.

1455
01:58:54,672 --> 01:58:55,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

1456
01:58:55,333 --> 01:58:56,114

01:58:57,055 --> 01:58:58,496
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki loves me.

1459
01:59:17,409 --> 01:59:21,550
[SPEAKER_03]: We did get one, Loki sucks.

1460
01:59:21,890 --> 01:59:23,351
[SPEAKER_05]: One person would comment since.

01:59:26,731 --> 01:59:29,492
[SPEAKER_05]: This goes out to Rob, and I fucking hate him.

02:02:35,169 --> 02:02:36,671
[SPEAKER_14]: I fucking hate this game!

1478
02:02:37,151 --> 02:02:38,352
[SPEAKER_14]: God damn you, Konami!

[SPEAKER_14]: God damn you!

1480
02:02:43,537 --> 02:02:47,640
[SPEAKER_14]: How did you fucking get a goal?

1481
02:02:51,164 --> 02:02:54,106
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the listeners are going to vote this number one for a week on end.

1482
02:02:56,095 --> 02:02:58,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go around the room and see what everybody thought of that one, starting with the Guana Girl.

1483
02:02:59,519 --> 02:03:00,460
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought it was fabulous.

1484
02:03:00,920 --> 02:03:02,922
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, I just can't believe it.

1485
02:03:03,443 --> 02:03:03,883
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a 10.

1486
02:03:04,905 --> 02:03:05,365
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a 10.

1487
02:03:06,666 --> 02:03:07,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Islander.

1488
02:03:07,547 --> 02:03:09,349
[SPEAKER_06]: It was so fabulous, I creamed my pants.

1489
02:03:11,452 --> 02:03:11,772
[SPEAKER_06]: Angel.

1490
02:03:13,314 --> 02:03:14,375
[SPEAKER_09]: Ew, it's so good.

1491
02:03:14,415 --> 02:03:15,676
[SPEAKER_09]: Community value 10.

1492
02:03:16,617 --> 02:03:17,178
[SPEAKER_17]: Exquisite.

1493
02:03:18,068 --> 02:03:18,989
[SPEAKER_08]: He's dead.

1494
02:03:20,150 --> 02:03:23,652
[SPEAKER_08]: I think he was one of those that got attacked with a butcher knife.

1495
02:03:24,993 --> 02:03:26,534
[SPEAKER_09]: He's alive!

1496
02:03:27,675 --> 02:03:31,337
[SPEAKER_18]: As for my thoughts... I think we're going to make a new record.

1497
02:03:32,939 --> 02:03:34,820
[SPEAKER_18]: Number one billboard chart.

1498
02:03:35,600 --> 02:03:38,322
[SPEAKER_03]: I give it a 10, and can I sleep over at your place tonight?

1499
02:03:38,342 --> 02:03:38,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

1500
02:03:38,462 --> 02:03:38,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1501
02:03:44,588 --> 02:03:46,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Place vote now.

1502
02:03:46,769 --> 02:03:48,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Song number one, Love Shack.

1503
02:03:49,151 --> 02:03:50,732
[SPEAKER_03]: Song number two, The Reason.

1504
02:03:51,452 --> 02:03:53,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Or song number three, Oops I Did It Again.

1505
02:03:55,975 --> 02:04:00,298
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to do it again and again, if I'm still alive, after this break.

1506
02:04:00,338 --> 02:04:01,779
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be right back, boys and girls.

1507
02:04:01,819 --> 02:04:03,841
[SPEAKER_03]: The FUs of the week are coming up pretty soon.

1508
02:04:04,101 --> 02:04:05,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Although now I'm having second thoughts.

1509
02:04:07,943 --> 02:04:09,084
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be back after this.

1510
02:04:33,829 --> 02:04:34,950
Thank you for watching!

1511
02:05:11,454 --> 02:05:12,358
Thanks for watching!

02:06:14,846 --> 02:06:15,809
Thank you for watching!

1513
02:06:44,807 --> 02:06:46,357
Thank you for watching!

1514
02:07:37,248 --> 02:07:59,260
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to see the color of your blue eyes, baby This is the night when we see the light Of the fire burning in my heart for your big love Celebrate, meditate, it's our anniversary Let's dedicate to love this magic moment You know this magic time is bringing peace and love We're gonna need the biggest emotion Celebrate, meditate, it's our anniversary Let's dedicate to love this magic moment

1515

Thank you for watching!

1516
02:08:43,075 --> 02:08:44,316
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio.

1517
02:08:44,636 --> 02:08:46,818
[SPEAKER_03]: We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.

1518
02:08:54,683 --> 02:08:56,884
[SPEAKER_03]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1519
02:08:58,265 --> 02:09:02,208
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's time to reveal the winner of tonight's cage match.

1520
02:09:03,348 --> 02:09:05,490
[SPEAKER_03]: And the winner of tonight's cage match is...

1521
02:09:06,320 --> 02:09:08,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki with Oops I Did It Again.

1522
02:09:08,702 --> 02:09:10,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Why are we not surprised?

1523
02:09:10,503 --> 02:09:11,144
[SPEAKER_03]: Surprised, surprised.

1524
02:09:11,164 --> 02:09:11,624
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what though?

1525
02:09:11,944 --> 02:09:14,586
[SPEAKER_03]: The other two songs got a surprising amount of pity votes.

1526
02:09:14,747 --> 02:09:16,108
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was very pleased.

1527
02:09:16,148 --> 02:09:19,410
[SPEAKER_03]: So the effort did not go unappreciated by the rest of us.

1528
02:09:20,171 --> 02:09:21,632
[SPEAKER_03]: We knew that Loki was going to cream us though.

1529
02:09:23,413 --> 02:09:24,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I have a hug, Loki?

1530
02:09:24,734 --> 02:09:25,155
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1531
02:09:26,976 --> 02:09:29,698
[SPEAKER_03]: He's taking off his aggressions on the Mario 64 right now.

1532
02:09:29,778 --> 02:09:30,359
[SPEAKER_03]: So what can you do?

1533
02:09:31,710 --> 02:09:33,111
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, like, what is that?

1534
02:09:33,712 --> 02:09:36,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Why are you holding two DSs over there, Angel?

1535
02:09:39,936 --> 02:09:40,977
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are crazy.

1536
02:09:41,618 --> 02:09:42,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1537
02:09:43,539 --> 02:09:46,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations, Loki, for winning tonight's cage match.

1538
02:09:47,022 --> 02:09:52,426
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was funny because one person, when they voted, I was going through the votes, one person said, this is the only time you'll ever see me voting for Brittany.

1539
02:09:56,769 --> 02:09:57,410
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that was funny.

1540
02:09:57,950 --> 02:09:58,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, um...

1541
02:10:00,471 --> 02:10:03,012
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do some winners for the MidiHead CDs.

1542
02:10:04,212 --> 02:10:05,733
[SPEAKER_03]: So hurry up, last chance to get in.

1543
02:10:05,773 --> 02:10:11,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Free stuff at OrangeOnTrader.com And also he said he was still taking some stuff on his site over at MidiHead.com too.

1544
02:10:11,955 --> 02:10:16,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, just use the email little bubble on his site and there's a little submission form.

1545
02:10:18,851 --> 02:10:19,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.

1546
02:10:19,271 --> 02:10:22,392
[SPEAKER_03]: And we got that song that he wanted to play earlier.

1547
02:10:22,652 --> 02:10:25,393
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually, I believe it's an unreleased track, so I'm pretty excited.

1548
02:10:25,413 --> 02:10:29,654
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to be playing an unreleased track of his later, so very excited we're going to be hearing that.

1549
02:10:30,154 --> 02:10:34,115
[SPEAKER_03]: In that break, before we came back, you heard some music from Parapara Paradise.

1550
02:10:34,675 --> 02:10:35,316
[SPEAKER_03]: You know that game.

1551
02:10:35,336 --> 02:10:36,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever happened to that game?

1552
02:10:36,476 --> 02:10:37,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Why did that game have to die?

1553
02:10:38,697 --> 02:10:42,938
[SPEAKER_03]: It was one of those games that was cool when it first came out, and then it sucked, and then it was cool again.

1554
02:10:43,058 --> 02:10:46,959
[SPEAKER_06]: What was cool about that game is that when we first played it, we had no idea what the hell Parapara was.

1555
02:10:47,984 --> 02:10:51,926
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we learned, and then it just wasn't as cool as it was.

1556
02:10:53,267 --> 02:10:53,647
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1557
02:10:58,350 --> 02:10:59,851
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, it was like one of those things where it was like...

1558
02:11:01,539 --> 02:11:05,181
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was cool when people didn't know that you had to do line dances to it, basically.

1559
02:11:05,221 --> 02:11:07,943
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when you found out you had to do the synchronized dance, it was kind of suck.

1560
02:11:08,243 --> 02:11:10,245
[SPEAKER_03]: But some people really got into it, which is, you know, good for them.

1561
02:11:10,625 --> 02:11:16,028
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when, you know, people just started to have fun with it and not take it so seriously, I think it was cool again.

1562
02:11:16,108 --> 02:11:18,390
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can go back and listen to that music anytime now.

1563
02:11:18,430 --> 02:11:21,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, there was a period there, though, where it was like, oh, para, para.

1564
02:11:22,392 --> 02:11:22,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, God.

1565
02:11:22,893 --> 02:11:23,673
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you're a beat.

1566
02:11:23,713 --> 02:11:26,835
[SPEAKER_06]: But no, I understand what you're saying about, like, going back and listening to the music.

1567
02:11:26,895 --> 02:11:27,115
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1568
02:11:28,176 --> 02:11:28,256
Hmm.

1569
02:11:28,860 --> 02:11:29,501
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1570
02:11:50,575 --> 02:11:56,779
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I noticed some folks in the chat room right now are talking about Disney's rave and some of the non-stops.

1571
02:11:56,799 --> 02:12:01,221
[SPEAKER_03]: It was kind of making me think, how did everything go over for Thanksgiving with you guys' non-stop marathon?

1572
02:12:01,501 --> 02:12:02,222
[SPEAKER_08]: Very, very well.

1573
02:12:02,982 --> 02:12:06,664
[SPEAKER_08]: We had some large listener counts on both days.

1574
02:12:07,385 --> 02:12:10,066
[SPEAKER_08]: I really hadn't anticipated on doing both days because I didn't, you know.

1575
02:12:10,486 --> 02:12:15,109
[SPEAKER_08]: You know how you have your TBS version of A Christmas Story?

1576
02:12:15,789 --> 02:12:18,791
[SPEAKER_08]: How they'll play it for like 24 hours straight and just...

1577
02:12:19,151 --> 02:12:20,613
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1578
02:12:36,449 --> 02:12:41,810
[SPEAKER_08]: Not quite as many people on the Friday rebroadcast, but still very, very respectable.

1579
02:12:42,451 --> 02:12:43,651
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of people tuned in.

1580
02:12:43,691 --> 02:12:44,171
[SPEAKER_08]: It was great.

1581
02:12:45,231 --> 02:12:53,994
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, of course, we did the Orange Lounge Rewind directly after, so I'm hoping that we got some of those people to listen in, so we got you guys some more exposure, too.

1582
02:12:54,114 --> 02:12:54,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

1583
02:12:54,474 --> 02:12:55,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

1584
02:12:55,194 --> 02:12:55,914
[SPEAKER_03]: We appreciate the help.

1585
02:12:56,374 --> 02:12:59,195
[SPEAKER_03]: And anything else exciting coming up on DDR Freak Radio in the near future?

1586
02:13:00,155 --> 02:13:01,096
[SPEAKER_08]: Not at the present time.

1587
02:13:01,116 --> 02:13:12,520
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to work with one of the moderators on a side project, see if maybe we can get that kind of working, but I don't know when that's going to be coming up.

1588
02:13:12,840 --> 02:13:13,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1589
02:13:13,340 --> 02:13:15,721
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure you guys will hear all about it by the time.

1590
02:13:16,181 --> 02:13:16,662
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure we will.

1591
02:13:16,682 --> 02:13:17,442
[SPEAKER_03]: It's ready.

1592
02:13:17,542 --> 02:13:19,723
[SPEAKER_03]: And we should do something for the end of the year.

1593
02:13:20,183 --> 02:13:20,443
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1594
02:13:20,483 --> 02:13:21,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Think of something to do.

1595
02:13:21,684 --> 02:13:21,944
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1596
02:13:22,084 --> 02:13:22,444
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do it.

1597
02:13:22,464 --> 02:13:22,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1598
02:13:22,964 --> 02:13:23,885
[SPEAKER_03]: Countdown or something.

1599
02:13:23,905 --> 02:13:24,305
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be fun.

1600
02:13:24,345 --> 02:13:24,825
[SPEAKER_08]: We could do that.

1601
02:13:24,845 --> 02:13:25,345
[SPEAKER_08]: We could do that.

1602
02:13:25,545 --> 02:13:26,906
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to meet at my place anyway.

1603
02:13:27,206 --> 02:13:27,646
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

1604
02:13:27,666 --> 02:13:28,567
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

1605
02:13:28,587 --> 02:13:29,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Live broadcast, maybe?

1606
02:13:29,667 --> 02:13:29,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

1607
02:13:30,088 --> 02:13:30,448
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

1608
02:13:30,928 --> 02:13:35,470
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, I hear that there's a reunion show in the works for Under Sedation Live.

1609
02:13:35,730 --> 02:13:36,471
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1610
02:13:36,551 --> 02:13:38,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Got contacted about that one today.

1611
02:13:38,191 --> 02:13:39,132
[SPEAKER_03]: That should be interesting.

1612
02:13:39,512 --> 02:13:48,738
[SPEAKER_03]: For those who don't know, Iguana Girl and I used to be co-hosts on a show over on another station, Under Station Live, which is still going, by the way, still kicking, over on Live 365.

1613
02:13:49,098 --> 02:13:51,339
[SPEAKER_03]: UnderStationLive.org is the site, if you want to check it out.

1614
02:13:51,599 --> 02:13:54,141
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's going to be a reunion show coming up with Iguana Girl and myself.

1615
02:13:54,181 --> 02:13:54,821
[SPEAKER_03]: That should be fun.

1616
02:13:54,881 --> 02:13:57,563
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe DarkSakura's going to be in on it, too, because she was a big part of it.

1617
02:13:57,583 --> 02:13:58,564
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, she was a big part of it.

1618
02:13:58,584 --> 02:14:01,465
[SPEAKER_03]: She was the most frequent... No, Islander or her.

1619
02:14:01,966 --> 02:14:04,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Either her or Islander was the most frequent guest at the end of it.

1620
02:14:04,747 --> 02:14:08,530
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so it'll probably be a situation where we'll all just hang out and...

1621
02:14:09,250 --> 02:14:15,552
[SPEAKER_08]: OneRoom, and then Skype with Travis Donovan over there and see if we can get it all working.

1622
02:14:15,572 --> 02:14:15,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.

1623
02:14:15,992 --> 02:14:17,452
[SPEAKER_08]: See if we can recapture the magic.

1624
02:14:17,613 --> 02:14:17,813
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1625
02:14:18,553 --> 02:14:20,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though it'll kind of be virtual a little bit.

1626
02:14:20,273 --> 02:14:20,573
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1627
02:14:21,694 --> 02:14:25,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Travis won't be able to throw any of his figures at me, which will be kind of sad, but, you know, what can you do?

1628
02:14:25,995 --> 02:14:27,295
[SPEAKER_06]: And I won't be able to see the white boy dance.

1629
02:14:27,936 --> 02:14:28,796
[SPEAKER_03]: No white boy dance.

1630
02:14:28,816 --> 02:14:29,996
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have to get him a webcam or something.

1631
02:14:30,616 --> 02:14:30,856
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1632
02:14:31,137 --> 02:14:31,457
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1633
02:14:31,577 --> 02:14:34,318
[SPEAKER_08]: No piles and piles of cigarette butts in the ashtray.

1634
02:14:36,696 --> 02:14:42,879
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of also brought up DDR Freak for a reason because I was kind of reading, you know, as a lot of people in the Bomani scene do, I was reading the message boards over there.

1635
02:14:43,659 --> 02:14:47,581
[SPEAKER_03]: And a little bit of spatting going on in the Ultramix 2 thread right now.

1636
02:14:47,601 --> 02:14:48,401
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit of spatting.

1637
02:14:49,147 --> 02:14:49,387
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

1638
02:14:49,407 --> 02:14:50,268
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't read that.

1639
02:14:50,748 --> 02:14:54,430
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, but nothing that needs moderation going on or anything.

1640
02:14:54,470 --> 02:15:00,613
[SPEAKER_03]: But just, you know, some people are a little upset with Ultramix 2, saying the timing is a big issue.

1641
02:15:00,633 --> 02:15:03,255
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're saying, we need a patch for Ultramix 2.

1642
02:15:03,995 --> 02:15:06,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Dear KCEH, patch Ultramix 2.

1643
02:15:06,837 --> 02:15:10,239
[SPEAKER_03]: The timing is screwed up, and it's screwing up my PA.

1644
02:15:10,339 --> 02:15:12,460
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't they do this already before?

1645
02:15:12,480 --> 02:15:14,101
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1646
02:15:14,537 --> 02:15:15,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably.

1647
02:15:15,238 --> 02:15:15,538
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1648
02:15:15,978 --> 02:15:18,240
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't this the same gripe that they've had?

1649
02:15:19,081 --> 02:15:19,681
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting.

1650
02:15:19,721 --> 02:15:25,565
[SPEAKER_03]: With every new mix that comes out, first bitch, the steps, second bitch, the timing, third bitch, the song list.

1651
02:15:25,986 --> 02:15:26,826
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing is enough.

1652
02:15:27,187 --> 02:15:27,927
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing is enough.

1653
02:15:29,148 --> 02:15:29,969
[SPEAKER_08]: Drives me bonkers.

1654
02:15:29,989 --> 02:15:30,349
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1655
02:15:30,389 --> 02:15:30,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1656
02:15:31,710 --> 02:15:34,652
[SPEAKER_03]: The nice thing is that nobody was really bitching about the song list or the steps this time.

1657
02:15:34,893 --> 02:15:35,773
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think the timing.

1658
02:15:35,793 --> 02:15:36,114
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, no.

1659
02:15:36,414 --> 02:15:37,775
[SPEAKER_08]: They have to bitch about something.

1660
02:15:38,455 --> 02:15:43,539
[SPEAKER_08]: It would not be, you know, in a consumer-run society, they have to bitch about something.

1661
02:15:44,740 --> 02:15:45,660
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, exactly.

1662
02:15:46,120 --> 02:15:47,321
[SPEAKER_08]: They have to bitch about something.

1663
02:15:47,521 --> 02:15:49,101
[SPEAKER_08]: No matter what, they have to bitch about something.

1664
02:15:49,161 --> 02:15:54,443
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess, you know, we just have to kind of deal with it and kind of ignore the idiots as much as we can.

1665
02:15:55,703 --> 02:15:58,604
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I'm trying to look at both sides of it.

1666
02:15:58,644 --> 02:16:00,544
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I try to take, you know, perspective.

1667
02:16:00,865 --> 02:16:03,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I got to see both sides of points of view here.

1668
02:16:03,745 --> 02:16:06,186
[SPEAKER_03]: And, yeah, the timing window is a little different from the arcade.

1669
02:16:06,626 --> 02:16:07,606
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's the thing.

1670
02:16:07,746 --> 02:16:09,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Ultramix is not the arcade.

1671
02:16:09,427 --> 02:16:09,527
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.

1672
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:14,420
[SPEAKER_03]: and I think that's what a lot of people often forget is that DDR in the arcade right now here in the U.S.

1673
02:16:15,089 --> 02:16:15,849
[SPEAKER_03]: is six feet under.

1674
02:16:16,210 --> 02:16:20,451
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, is there a chance that it will rise from the grave and, you know... Lord, I hope so.

1675
02:16:20,532 --> 02:16:22,032
[SPEAKER_03]: ...kick some ass again in the arcade?

1676
02:16:22,192 --> 02:16:22,693
[SPEAKER_03]: We hope so.

1677
02:16:22,753 --> 02:16:23,553
[SPEAKER_03]: We really, really hope so.

1678
02:16:23,993 --> 02:16:25,974
[SPEAKER_03]: But for now, you know, home version is what we got.

1679
02:16:26,614 --> 02:16:27,695
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know.

1680
02:16:27,735 --> 02:16:36,759
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the comparisons to Extreme and the other Japanese mixes are very interesting when you consider that they're not even really supposed to be here.

1681
02:16:37,619 --> 02:16:38,120
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?

1682
02:16:38,280 --> 02:16:38,580
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1683
02:16:38,740 --> 02:16:40,000
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know.

1684
02:16:41,481 --> 02:16:43,202
[SPEAKER_03]: I can kind of see why...

1685
02:16:45,298 --> 02:16:48,599
[SPEAKER_03]: There might be a difference, too, in the fact that you're dealing with completely different hardware.

1686
02:16:49,180 --> 02:16:52,301
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're dealing with an engine that was probably written from the ground up.

1687
02:16:53,061 --> 02:16:55,022
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't really written to emulate the arcade.

1688
02:16:55,042 --> 02:16:56,102
[SPEAKER_03]: It was written to be something new.

1689
02:16:56,222 --> 02:16:58,523
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's what a lot of people have grown to appreciate about Ultramix 2.

1690
02:16:59,063 --> 02:16:59,604
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?

1691
02:16:59,944 --> 02:17:01,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Where it's kind of like, it's supposed to be something new.

1692
02:17:02,285 --> 02:17:03,365
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not going to get it 100%.

1693
02:17:05,166 --> 02:17:06,546
[SPEAKER_03]: But, I don't know.

1694
02:17:07,607 --> 02:17:09,727
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, like I said, it's going to be something.

1695
02:17:09,887 --> 02:17:11,148
[SPEAKER_08]: It's always going to be something.

1696
02:17:11,927 --> 02:17:12,547
[SPEAKER_08]: No matter what.

1697
02:17:13,488 --> 02:17:21,352
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's frustrating that people can't just appreciate the fact that we are getting these new mixes and that these are things that we...

1698
02:17:22,840 --> 02:17:25,222
[SPEAKER_08]: How long ago weren't expecting to get any of?

1699
02:17:25,803 --> 02:17:27,484
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, what, less than two years ago?

1700
02:17:27,504 --> 02:17:28,065
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh-huh.

1701
02:17:28,245 --> 02:17:29,526
[SPEAKER_08]: We were having to import everything.

1702
02:17:29,746 --> 02:17:30,107
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh-huh.

1703
02:17:30,347 --> 02:17:39,074
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I personally, I'm just thankful the fact that we have these mixes and the fact that we're getting, that we have, you know, people that are interested enough in it to keep us going.

1704
02:17:39,495 --> 02:17:44,179
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not going to say that people who are complaining about it are not thankful because chances are they are.

1705
02:17:44,239 --> 02:17:45,220
[SPEAKER_03]: They probably love the game.

1706
02:17:45,420 --> 02:17:45,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1707
02:17:45,640 --> 02:17:46,561
[SPEAKER_08]: They just, you know, they want to find ways.

1708
02:17:46,581 --> 02:17:48,703
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not expressing it and that's my concern.

1709
02:17:48,743 --> 02:17:49,984
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to find ways to make it better.

1710
02:17:50,564 --> 02:17:53,767
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but there's ways to go about that.

1711
02:17:54,828 --> 02:18:01,634
[SPEAKER_08]: And bitching on a message board, you know, namely DDR Freak, is not the way to go about doing so.

1712
02:18:02,495 --> 02:18:05,258
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, write your complaints in a letter.

1713
02:18:06,078 --> 02:18:08,180
[SPEAKER_08]: Send it to the appropriate parties.

1714
02:18:08,220 --> 02:18:09,782
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't just bitch about it on a message board.

1715
02:18:10,763 --> 02:18:10,983
[SPEAKER_08]: You know?

1716
02:18:12,147 --> 02:18:12,888
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't need it.

1717
02:18:13,028 --> 02:18:15,669
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't need the drama.

1718
02:18:15,870 --> 02:18:17,531
[SPEAKER_08]: We got enough drama on our own.

1719
02:18:33,663 --> 02:18:37,489
[SPEAKER_03]: OrangeLoungeRadio.com Era, End of the Century, La Señorita, Silent Hill, I Feel the Junk Circuit Mix

1720
02:18:48,277 --> 02:18:50,798
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what... And a lot of people are saying it ain't worth it.

1721
02:18:50,818 --> 02:18:52,078
[SPEAKER_03]: We've played these songs to death.

1722
02:18:52,278 --> 02:18:53,038
[SPEAKER_08]: Then don't buy it.

1723
02:18:53,178 --> 02:18:56,739
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm seeing... And a lot of people are expressing they're not going to, which is, you know, fine.

1724
02:18:56,779 --> 02:19:01,880
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is one of those things where I kind of see it's really Konami is in a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation.

1725
02:19:01,920 --> 02:19:07,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Because when they don't give us these songs, people go, there's not enough of the Japanese mixes in the game.

1726
02:19:08,621 --> 02:19:13,802
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm kind of like... These songs here are like staple DDR songs.

1727
02:19:14,082 --> 02:19:14,242
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

1728
02:19:14,402 --> 02:19:16,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Have never been on the Xbox before.

1729
02:19:16,483 --> 02:19:17,823
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're not a PS2 owner...

1730
02:19:18,743 --> 02:19:19,683
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a godsend.

1731
02:19:19,724 --> 02:19:25,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like if you're not an Xbox owner, Festival is probably great for you.

1732
02:19:25,066 --> 02:19:29,368
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas a lot of people are hating on it because they're saying, it's just a copy of the Xbox version.

1733
02:19:29,408 --> 02:19:36,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, but if I were living in Japan and I didn't import my games from the US, which I imagine not a lot of people do, I'd probably love it.

1734
02:19:37,092 --> 02:19:37,952
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know.

1735
02:19:39,208 --> 02:19:43,992
[SPEAKER_08]: I think a lot of the people are just kind of taking it with a grain of salt at this point.

1736
02:19:44,052 --> 02:19:47,074
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you can't take it personally.

1737
02:19:47,594 --> 02:19:50,777
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't take a lot of the complaints to heart.

1738
02:19:50,917 --> 02:19:51,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, oh yeah.

1739
02:19:52,038 --> 02:19:54,559
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know most people at Konami probably don't.

1740
02:19:54,579 --> 02:19:57,361
[SPEAKER_03]: And they probably do take each criticism.

1741
02:19:57,401 --> 02:20:00,243
[SPEAKER_03]: They probably say, okay, maybe we should... Yeah, but after about the 15th...

1742
02:20:01,263 --> 02:20:02,223
[SPEAKER_08]: Billionth Time.

1743
02:20:02,603 --> 02:20:09,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe in the next song pack, just two or three of these songs, and then two or three new songs, and maybe people will be happier.

1744
02:20:09,426 --> 02:20:09,846
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1745
02:20:11,766 --> 02:20:12,107
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1746
02:20:12,487 --> 02:20:12,887
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree.

1747
02:20:13,087 --> 02:20:15,428
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they're in a damn if you do, damn if you don't situation.

1748
02:20:15,568 --> 02:20:17,648
[SPEAKER_03]: There's five more song packs to go, boys and girls.

1749
02:20:17,888 --> 02:20:19,349
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the best is still yet to come.

1750
02:20:20,009 --> 02:20:23,190
[SPEAKER_03]: I think one of the better song packs for Ultramix 1 was one of the later ones.

1751
02:20:23,210 --> 02:20:24,331
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say it was song pack 4?

1752
02:20:25,831 --> 02:20:26,732
[SPEAKER_03]: was a really good one.

1753
02:20:28,333 --> 02:20:30,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, hold on to your butts.

1754
02:20:30,635 --> 02:20:31,455
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be a fun ride.

1755
02:20:31,796 --> 02:20:41,823
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's going to be better... I mean, I will probably buy this song pack anyway just so I can play these songs on Xbox Live because I would like to play Era on Xbox Live because I love TAC.

1756
02:20:42,264 --> 02:20:50,130
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, that's enough to seal the deal for me right there is that we haven't had a lot of these songs in 60 frames a second and, you know, on Xbox Live before, so why not?

1757
02:20:50,530 --> 02:20:53,412
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're not going to buy it, then fine, I won't play you.

1758
02:20:55,563 --> 02:20:55,663
[SPEAKER_03]: F.U.S.

1759
02:20:55,683 --> 02:20:55,943
[SPEAKER_03]: of the Week

1760
02:21:24,927 --> 02:21:25,629
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, this is bad.

1761
02:21:25,669 --> 02:21:26,490
[SPEAKER_08]: Here is justice.

1762
02:21:26,911 --> 02:21:27,912
[SPEAKER_13]: Here is punishment.

1763
02:21:42,597 --> 02:21:51,332
[SPEAKER_03]: On behalf of Jamie, I'll just enter in an F you to old people and drivers, stupid people, uneducated people.

1764
02:21:52,534 --> 02:21:54,678
[SPEAKER_03]: What else does Jamie... Customers.

1765
02:21:54,698 --> 02:21:55,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Customers.

1766
02:21:56,080 --> 02:21:56,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so...

1767
02:21:57,583 --> 02:21:59,863
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I probably hit on something in there, I hope.

1768
02:21:59,983 --> 02:22:00,384
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

1769
02:22:00,624 --> 02:22:01,224
[SPEAKER_08]: Hurricanes.

1770
02:22:01,684 --> 02:22:02,224
[SPEAKER_03]: That too.

1771
02:22:02,264 --> 02:22:02,924
[SPEAKER_03]: Light prices.

1772
02:22:03,184 --> 02:22:04,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe, you know what, maybe... Yeah, light prices.

1773
02:22:04,664 --> 02:22:07,385
[SPEAKER_03]: She's probably pissed off at jet lag right now, being in Alabama.

1774
02:22:07,885 --> 02:22:07,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1775
02:22:08,045 --> 02:22:12,026
[SPEAKER_03]: So... And I'm sure she's missing us really badly.

1776
02:22:12,546 --> 02:22:16,566
[SPEAKER_03]: She would give an F you to missing Skye and Loki and Iguana Girl and Islander and everybody here.

1777
02:22:18,107 --> 02:22:19,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, anyway, let's move on.

1778
02:22:19,347 --> 02:22:24,988
[SPEAKER_13]: Jimmy.

1779
02:22:25,008 --> 02:22:25,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

1780
02:22:26,963 --> 02:22:31,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck you to Mario 64 DS for being frustrating.

1781
02:22:31,485 --> 02:22:34,686
[SPEAKER_04]: No wonder I didn't have the original game, it was too frustrating.

1782
02:22:34,986 --> 02:22:42,909
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to throw my DS, but then before I throw it, I realize how expensive it was, and then don't throw it, and continue to play the game and get frustrated even more.

1783
02:22:43,989 --> 02:22:50,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, anyway, and also, fuck you to leaves, there's still tons of them outside, and they're still piled up next to my car.

1784
02:22:50,951 --> 02:22:55,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of car, fuck you to my car, because it's broken in some way and I don't know why.

1785
02:22:55,996 --> 02:23:03,121
[SPEAKER_04]: And the problem is, is I don't want to take another day off of work just to go down to the dealership and take my car down there so they can tell me that they don't know what's wrong with it.

1786
02:23:03,141 --> 02:23:03,961
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's broken.

1787
02:23:04,602 --> 02:23:14,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, um, so it still drives, and I don't think it's anything major, like maybe the alignment's off or, you know, the brakes are falling off or something, but other than that, you know, it's fine.

1788
02:23:14,869 --> 02:23:22,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, then, uh, really, I don't know, fuck you for wasting this entire four-day weekend on Final Fantasy XI.

1789
02:23:23,226 --> 02:23:24,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I really didn't do anything.

1790
02:23:24,727 --> 02:23:26,809
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't work on my cabinet, which I should have.

1791
02:23:26,929 --> 02:23:31,693
[SPEAKER_04]: And I didn't, you know, clean house or, you know, God knows what else.

1792
02:23:31,973 --> 02:23:33,474
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, visit family or something.

1793
02:23:34,355 --> 02:23:35,175
[SPEAKER_04]: So that sucks.

1794
02:23:35,616 --> 02:23:38,218
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, what else?

1795
02:23:38,438 --> 02:23:49,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, just, um, fuck you to work because, you know, Movie Gallery is talking about buying Hollywood video and that means that there will be twice as many stupid people that I have to talk to every day.

1796
02:23:50,547 --> 02:23:51,328
[SPEAKER_04]: So that sucks.

1797
02:23:54,246 --> 02:23:56,968
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh wait, no!

1798
02:23:57,409 --> 02:23:59,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck you for Karaoke Revolution!

1799
02:23:59,331 --> 02:24:04,255
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why I bought that game and wasted my money, but whatever.

1800
02:24:04,355 --> 02:24:10,801
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, I'm done.

1801
02:24:15,085 --> 02:24:17,007
[SPEAKER_03]: I escaped the FUs, I was so happy.

1802
02:24:17,027 --> 02:24:17,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

1803
02:24:18,678 --> 02:24:20,779
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, I'm actually not very angry this week.

1804
02:24:20,819 --> 02:24:26,642
[SPEAKER_03]: I think F you to just the time really flying by these past four days and the realization that I gotta go back to work tomorrow.

1805
02:24:27,442 --> 02:24:32,625
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that, I mean, I love my job, don't get me wrong, I absolutely adore my job, but you know, I adore sitting on my ass even more.

1806
02:24:33,385 --> 02:24:36,707
[SPEAKER_03]: Really is what it boils down to, so I can't, you know.

1807
02:24:37,467 --> 02:24:41,729
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to Halo 2 and getting killed by 13 year olds and then being made fun of by them.

1808
02:24:42,284 --> 02:24:43,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

1809
02:24:57,250 --> 02:25:03,212
[SPEAKER_03]: and FU to Sigurd, because he said that he would only be able to battle me on controller tonight on Xbox Live.

1810
02:25:03,232 --> 02:25:06,633
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to have to postpone the battle until later anyway, because we're running out of time.

1811
02:25:07,073 --> 02:25:12,555
[SPEAKER_03]: And we did, the karaoke thing kind of bumped him, which I'm sure he's pleased about, and he'll probably give me an FU about that later, but we'll see.

1812
02:25:13,195 --> 02:25:16,356
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, otherwise, I think I'm okay.

1813
02:25:16,776 --> 02:25:17,957
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had a pretty good weekend.

1814
02:25:18,177 --> 02:25:22,038
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a lot to be thankful for this Thanksgiving season, and, um...

1815
02:25:23,200 --> 02:25:23,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I know.

1816
02:25:24,121 --> 02:25:33,085
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to whoever decided... My really, really good friend Christopher was in the hospital for his appendix, to have his appendix taken out.

1817
02:25:33,826 --> 02:25:39,488
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to whoever decided to play a cruel joke on him and make him go back to have his gallbladder taken out two days later.

1818
02:25:41,149 --> 02:25:41,770
[SPEAKER_03]: That sucks.

1819
02:25:42,270 --> 02:25:43,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Feel better soon, Christopher.

1820
02:25:43,591 --> 02:25:44,091
[SPEAKER_03]: We miss you.

1821
02:25:45,114 --> 02:25:49,398
[SPEAKER_04]: And fuck you, Comedy Central, for not having a new episode drawn together on this week.

1822
02:25:49,438 --> 02:25:53,381
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to wait fucking another week for a brand new episode, and that pisses me off.

1823
02:25:54,302 --> 02:25:59,566
[SPEAKER_04]: But thank you for airing two nights in a row, South Park, bigger, longer, and uncut.

1824
02:26:00,627 --> 02:26:04,250
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you for steering my FUs in a completely different direction.

1825
02:26:04,691 --> 02:26:06,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on to Iguana Girl.

1826
02:26:06,432 --> 02:26:07,233
[SPEAKER_03]: She's got a microphone.

1827
02:26:08,934 --> 02:26:11,296
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a microphone, and I'm not afraid to use it.

1828
02:26:11,316 --> 02:26:11,357
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

1829
02:26:12,819 --> 02:26:29,479
[SPEAKER_08]: Big huge F you to my car for having this really weird really screwed up like brake problem that is inconsistent and only happens when it's not raining and now I also screw my car because it uh

1830
02:26:30,034 --> 02:26:34,019
[SPEAKER_08]: Decided to start making a squealing noise whenever I make a hard turn left, also.

1831
02:26:34,420 --> 02:26:48,818
[SPEAKER_08]: So, uh, yeah, so, uh, this is, like, multiple issues that the people over at Pet Boys could not figure out, and now I have to take it to the dealership to have them look at it and tell me that, you know, I need to spend, like, a thousand dollars to get it fixed or something like that.

1832
02:26:50,626 --> 02:26:58,954
[SPEAKER_08]: and big huge fuck you to the fact that I actually had to work on Friday while all of you guys were being lazy asses and had Friday off.

1833
02:26:59,154 --> 02:26:59,535
[SPEAKER_13]: Yay!

1834
02:27:02,822 --> 02:27:06,465
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, being in retail-ish stuff sucks.

1835
02:27:08,566 --> 02:27:12,850
[SPEAKER_08]: And a big huge FU to still having like two weeks left of school.

1836
02:27:12,950 --> 02:27:15,812
[SPEAKER_08]: And a big huge FU to having to study for finals soon.

1837
02:27:16,873 --> 02:27:19,615
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's about it.

1838
02:27:20,856 --> 02:27:22,577
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, let's move on to Islander.

1839
02:27:23,518 --> 02:27:25,139
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, I've got a big FU.

1840
02:27:25,940 --> 02:27:29,722
[SPEAKER_06]: To the state of California for sending me a jury duty notice.

1841
02:27:31,045 --> 02:27:38,068
[SPEAKER_06]: I faxed in the stuff that I needed to fax in saying I cannot take time off from work, yada yada.

1842
02:27:38,568 --> 02:27:40,149
[SPEAKER_06]: I never got a response.

1843
02:27:40,229 --> 02:27:40,969
[SPEAKER_06]: How lovely!

1844
02:27:42,690 --> 02:27:44,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Be glad you're not on the Peterson jury.

1845
02:27:45,111 --> 02:27:45,391
[SPEAKER_06]: Really.

1846
02:27:46,111 --> 02:27:48,952
[SPEAKER_06]: So, unfortunately, tomorrow is supposed to be my day off.

1847
02:27:49,772 --> 02:27:54,954
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to, unfortunately, go down to the courthouse and see if I get picked to serve in a jury.

1848
02:27:56,255 --> 02:27:57,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no, no, no.

1849
02:27:57,716 --> 02:27:58,216
[SPEAKER_06]: In my LJ...

1850
02:27:59,110 --> 02:28:06,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Good buddy of mine, Jabberwocky, suggested walking into the courthouse with a copy of the Weekly World News to show how unintelligent I am, and I think I'll do that.

1851
02:28:08,176 --> 02:28:08,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Fabulous.

1852
02:28:09,297 --> 02:28:19,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Second FU is actually also to the state of California for a late payment on my car insurance, and they want to suspend my license.

1853
02:28:21,417 --> 02:28:22,678
[SPEAKER_08]: Big huge long story behind that.

1854
02:28:22,698 --> 02:28:23,979
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not going to get into that.

1855
02:28:24,079 --> 02:28:26,841
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, long story short, he's got to do that tomorrow too.

1856
02:28:27,261 --> 02:28:31,364
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I've got a really long day with this data, and I really don't like this data at this point.

1857
02:28:33,645 --> 02:28:43,412
[SPEAKER_06]: But other than that, and also, as I want to go mention, as you do working on Friday, that sucks, but hey, I need the money.

1858
02:28:46,614 --> 02:28:48,355
[SPEAKER_06]: And yep, that's about it.

1859
02:28:48,375 --> 02:28:51,057
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's move on to DDR Angel.

1860
02:28:54,057 --> 02:28:54,237
[SPEAKER_09]: Addict.

1861
02:28:54,838 --> 02:28:57,920
[SPEAKER_09]: Tell him I got my first summon today and I'm very excited.

1862
02:28:57,960 --> 02:28:58,460
[SPEAKER_09]: My summoner is level 20.

1863
02:28:58,560 --> 02:28:58,801
[SPEAKER_09]: Addict.

1864
02:29:24,534 --> 02:29:35,142
[SPEAKER_09]: and F you to the party in FF11 that I was in the other day because I said I had to go and deal with real life issues and they said, what's real life?

1865
02:29:36,063 --> 02:29:40,386
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm like, okay, bye-bye, bye-bye now, bye-bye.

1866
02:29:41,146 --> 02:29:49,933
[SPEAKER_09]: So just F you to that because you guys are probably 13 and don't know any better and don't have a life like the rest of us that have to get away and real life comes first.

1867
02:29:51,744 --> 02:29:56,085
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought I saw something on LiveJournal.

1868
02:30:21,417 --> 02:30:22,858
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

1869
02:30:23,098 --> 02:30:24,379
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll take that discussion offline.

1870
02:30:24,419 --> 02:30:25,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Meanwhile, explicit.

1871
02:30:28,743 --> 02:30:41,052
[SPEAKER_18]: Grab the mic by the bottom because the cord's coming out a little bit and it's making a... Yeah, there, try that.

1872
02:30:41,852 --> 02:30:42,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Talk now.

1873
02:30:44,114 --> 02:30:47,637
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, it's still cutting out.

1874
02:30:47,657 --> 02:30:48,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we get him that other microphone real quick?

1875
02:30:49,098 --> 02:30:50,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, bud, I don't know what's going on with that.

1876
02:30:53,052 --> 02:30:53,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead.

1877
02:30:54,293 --> 02:30:56,115
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that one's really loud, so keep it away.

1878
02:30:56,135 --> 02:30:56,395
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

1879
02:30:56,555 --> 02:30:56,855
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1880
02:30:57,496 --> 02:31:12,608
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd like to say an F you to some asshole who opened a door off of a supermarket, opened the door, slams my car, leaves a big mark, but luckily I have his license plate number so I can go to the department and sue his ass.

1881
02:31:14,510 --> 02:31:17,772
[SPEAKER_18]: If you're a webcam, I want to give him the middle finger.

1882
02:31:19,093 --> 02:31:19,313
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1883
02:31:19,333 --> 02:31:19,834
[SPEAKER_18]: Middle finger.

1884
02:31:21,716 --> 02:31:40,355
[SPEAKER_18]: F you for the turkey for being so dry I think the turkey would say F you I'm dead F you for Fries for having a very fucking long line

1885
02:31:42,214 --> 02:31:43,775
[SPEAKER_04]: I completely forgot about that.

1886
02:31:44,556 --> 02:31:49,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Fry's, so I get there, I go shopping on Black Friday, for God knows what reason.

1887
02:31:49,740 --> 02:31:54,783
[SPEAKER_04]: I just decided, gee, you know, I don't think I've been fucked up the ass enough this week, let's go to Fry's.

1888
02:31:55,244 --> 02:31:59,227
[SPEAKER_04]: So I go to Fry's, and their line wraps around the whole fucking store.

1889
02:31:59,507 --> 02:32:01,248
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just... forever.

1890
02:32:01,669 --> 02:32:05,471
[SPEAKER_04]: I, like, walk in line, I'm like, I'm all, damn, this line keeps going.

1891
02:32:05,591 --> 02:32:10,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep walking, keep walking, keep walking, see far off in the distance, in the horizon...

1892
02:32:10,783 --> 02:32:13,005
[SPEAKER_04]: A woman with balloons that says, end of line.

1893
02:32:13,045 --> 02:32:15,166
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, ah, fuck it.

1894
02:32:15,466 --> 02:32:17,267
[SPEAKER_04]: So then I had to make a judgment decision.

1895
02:32:17,788 --> 02:32:21,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I want to buy the stuff that I couldn't find anywhere else?

1896
02:32:21,310 --> 02:32:22,451
[SPEAKER_07]: Or run out the door.

1897
02:32:22,531 --> 02:32:22,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Or leave.

1898
02:32:23,692 --> 02:32:26,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wait, if I leave, I have to wait in line to get out of the store.

1899
02:32:26,373 --> 02:32:28,235
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, it fucking sucks.

1900
02:32:28,295 --> 02:32:28,715
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

1901
02:32:28,775 --> 02:32:29,035
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway.

1902
02:32:29,115 --> 02:32:35,059
[SPEAKER_18]: Everything what Loki said, except that the register saying, sorry, we closed the line.

1903
02:32:35,139 --> 02:32:35,459
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1904
02:32:35,620 --> 02:32:35,980
[SPEAKER_18]: Bye-bye.

1905
02:32:37,455 --> 02:32:41,276
[SPEAKER_18]: Just what I was about to buy in my $30, 512 megabyte RAM.

1906
02:32:43,377 --> 02:32:43,937
[SPEAKER_20]: I need RAM.

1907
02:32:44,817 --> 02:32:49,839
[SPEAKER_18]: Now I have to spend $90 or $120 just for it now, because it was a big ass sale at the time.

1908
02:32:51,059 --> 02:32:52,760
[SPEAKER_18]: There goes one-fourth of the damn price.

1909
02:32:54,020 --> 02:32:57,862
[SPEAKER_18]: And I have to get to Texas Hold'em for giving me some very, very shitty cards.

1910
02:32:58,602 --> 02:32:58,722
[SPEAKER_18]: How...

1911
02:32:59,830 --> 02:33:01,971
[SPEAKER_18]: Fuck you!

1912
02:33:02,212 --> 02:33:04,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Islander pulled out the Texas Hold'em poker set.

1913
02:33:05,033 --> 02:33:08,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Texas Hold'em Sacramento chapter is coming soon from what I hear.

1914
02:33:08,755 --> 02:33:10,116
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's more like Texas Fuck'em.

1915
02:33:13,218 --> 02:33:15,460
[SPEAKER_18]: How the hell can you win with three and two?

1916
02:33:16,060 --> 02:33:17,181
[SPEAKER_18]: That's nearly impossible.

1917
02:33:19,142 --> 02:33:19,462
[SPEAKER_18]: No.

1918
02:33:20,122 --> 02:33:23,104
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

1919
02:33:23,384 --> 02:33:24,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Three hour show.

1920
02:33:24,325 --> 02:33:25,265
[SPEAKER_03]: Three hour show, guys.

1921
02:33:25,305 --> 02:33:25,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Wrap it up.

1922
02:33:28,416 --> 02:33:32,379
[SPEAKER_18]: and NFU4 losing my very rare European watch.

1923
02:33:32,899 --> 02:33:34,520
[SPEAKER_18]: It's now gone, I don't wear it anymore.

1924
02:33:34,540 --> 02:33:42,305
[SPEAKER_18]: NFU4 worked for miscalculating my hours and money I've actually earned the whole two weeks.

1925
02:33:43,486 --> 02:33:47,248
[SPEAKER_18]: Damn it, I know I have $100 missing.

1926
02:33:48,389 --> 02:33:49,750
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm like, what the fuck?

1927
02:33:50,670 --> 02:33:53,112
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not going to come around getting slave labor now.

1928
02:33:54,152 --> 02:33:54,533
[SPEAKER_18]: Shit.

1929
02:33:57,174 --> 02:34:02,358
[SPEAKER_18]: and F you to the family for making the whole Thanksgiving all anti-American.

1930
02:34:05,039 --> 02:34:06,840
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you make Thanksgiving anti-American?

1931
02:34:07,761 --> 02:34:09,302
[SPEAKER_18]: The only American food was turkey.

1932
02:34:12,504 --> 02:34:15,526
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought you meant like they were burning flags in the front yard or something.

1933
02:34:20,816 --> 02:34:22,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Storytime, Islanders laughing.

1934
02:34:22,577 --> 02:34:22,917
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up?

1935
02:34:22,977 --> 02:34:23,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Storytime.

1936
02:34:26,579 --> 02:34:27,499
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm stopping the music.

1937
02:34:27,559 --> 02:34:29,120
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't take Captain Jack anymore.

1938
02:34:29,140 --> 02:34:29,540
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

1939
02:34:30,381 --> 02:34:33,302
[SPEAKER_08]: We're at Ross's sister's house.

1940
02:34:33,742 --> 02:34:39,585
[SPEAKER_08]: And she's talking about how she was talking to this friend of hers, this co-worker of hers.

1941
02:34:39,645 --> 02:34:42,467
[SPEAKER_08]: And she's like, oh, well, I don't know how to make green bean casserole.

1942
02:34:42,887 --> 02:34:43,567
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, wait, no.

1943
02:34:43,927 --> 02:34:46,989
[SPEAKER_08]: My little brother's girlfriend is going to be there.

1944
02:34:47,289 --> 02:34:47,889
[SPEAKER_08]: She's white.

1945
02:34:47,949 --> 02:34:48,990
[SPEAKER_08]: She'll know how to make it.

1946
02:34:54,031 --> 02:34:58,052
[SPEAKER_08]: Since when is it a requirement of white people to know how to make green bean casserole?

1947
02:34:58,553 --> 02:34:59,153
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm scared.

1948
02:34:59,333 --> 02:35:02,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that mean I have to be deported because I don't know how to make, you know, casserole?

1949
02:35:03,434 --> 02:35:05,195
[SPEAKER_08]: I eat black!

1950
02:35:05,355 --> 02:35:05,955
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow!

1951
02:35:08,196 --> 02:35:10,217
[SPEAKER_08]: I can make me some collard greens!

1952
02:35:10,557 --> 02:35:11,937
[SPEAKER_25]: I can make hot pockets.

1953
02:35:12,177 --> 02:35:13,858
[SPEAKER_25]: Does that count for anything?

1954
02:35:13,898 --> 02:35:15,218
[SPEAKER_25]: Mac and cheese?

1955
02:35:16,399 --> 02:35:17,039
[SPEAKER_03]: A hot pocket?

1956
02:35:18,840 --> 02:35:21,261
[SPEAKER_04]: I eat a lot of pork and I like fried chicken.

1957
02:35:21,321 --> 02:35:22,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that, you know...

1958
02:35:23,812 --> 02:35:24,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I join the club?

1959
02:35:25,613 --> 02:35:26,413
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, explicit.

1960
02:35:26,914 --> 02:35:27,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Finish up your thought.

1961
02:35:27,554 --> 02:35:28,895
[SPEAKER_03]: We gotta get to the chatroom FUs.

1962
02:35:30,115 --> 02:35:35,838
[SPEAKER_18]: FU for people complaining about Ultramix 2 and yadda yadda butt stabs and such, such, such, such.

1963
02:35:36,318 --> 02:35:42,140
[SPEAKER_18]: If you don't like those stabs, you can either edit the stabs by yourself, buy a memory card, or buy an Xbox edit.

1964
02:35:43,041 --> 02:35:45,602
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm assuming that Ultramix 2 has edits to make, right?

1965
02:35:46,602 --> 02:35:46,782
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

1966
02:35:47,123 --> 02:35:47,463
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

1967
02:35:47,983 --> 02:35:50,064
[SPEAKER_18]: Or you can go to Stumbadia and make your own shit.

1968
02:35:50,939 --> 02:35:51,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Plain and simple.

1969
02:35:51,840 --> 02:35:53,402
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure Konami loves hearing that.

1970
02:35:53,502 --> 02:35:53,802
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1971
02:35:54,623 --> 02:35:54,883
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1972
02:35:55,223 --> 02:35:56,184
[SPEAKER_03]: We got to go to the chat room.

1973
02:35:56,264 --> 02:35:56,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1974
02:35:56,425 --> 02:35:57,145
[SPEAKER_03]: To be continued.

1975
02:35:57,165 --> 02:35:57,486
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1976
02:35:57,846 --> 02:35:58,366
[SPEAKER_03]: As usual.

1977
02:35:58,427 --> 02:35:58,747
[SPEAKER_03]: Goody, goody.

1978
02:35:58,787 --> 02:35:59,107
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1979
02:35:59,127 --> 02:35:59,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's bring the music back.

1980
02:36:03,071 --> 02:36:04,613
[SPEAKER_03]: This is good chat room FU music.

1981
02:36:07,816 --> 02:36:09,297
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1982
02:36:10,779 --> 02:36:12,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Misty says two words.

1983
02:36:12,901 --> 02:36:13,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck fleeting.

1984
02:36:16,525 --> 02:36:17,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Panda.

1985
02:36:18,146 --> 02:36:19,446
[SPEAKER_13]: Amen.

1986
02:36:19,466 --> 02:36:23,346
[SPEAKER_08]: A-freaking-men.

1987
02:36:23,486 --> 02:36:26,547
[SPEAKER_03]: All the guys in the room just had the worst reaction to that.

1988
02:36:26,567 --> 02:36:27,747
[SPEAKER_03]: That was amazing.

1989
02:36:29,307 --> 02:36:33,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Panda just said, F you to Comcast for not working most of the time.

1990
02:36:33,648 --> 02:36:36,949
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to my mom's friend for what I think is more than just a friend.

1991
02:36:37,329 --> 02:36:38,269
[SPEAKER_03]: And F you to life.

1992
02:36:40,509 --> 02:36:44,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Snowcat says, F you to broken teeth and having to go to the dentist in the morning.

1993
02:36:44,210 --> 02:36:44,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Cry.

1994
02:36:45,106 --> 02:36:45,386
[SPEAKER_13]: Yuck.

1995
02:36:46,667 --> 02:36:52,770
[SPEAKER_03]: MPQ says, fuck Tekken 5 for being more important to local arcade goers than 2DX.

1996
02:36:53,971 --> 02:36:54,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it is pretty.

1997
02:36:55,812 --> 02:36:56,732
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty, but that's about it.

1998
02:36:57,473 --> 02:37:05,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Illusion says, F you to my brother being a greedy bastard and not letting me use his Xbox to play Ultramix 2 more than a few days in a row.

1999
02:37:06,217 --> 02:37:07,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you need to fix every day.

2000
02:37:07,758 --> 02:37:08,778
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like heroin.

2001
02:37:08,838 --> 02:37:09,659
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like heroin.

2002
02:37:10,900 --> 02:37:11,720
[SPEAKER_08]: Tap the vein, baby.

2003
02:37:12,722 --> 02:37:18,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Elmullet says F you in general to morons who complain about Ultramix 2 for the most asinine reasons.

2004
02:37:18,885 --> 02:37:20,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up about the timing windows, guys.

2005
02:37:20,865 --> 02:37:21,566
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't matter.

2006
02:37:21,686 --> 02:37:23,206
[SPEAKER_03]: Just pick a song and have fun.

2007
02:37:23,787 --> 02:37:24,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeesh.

2008
02:37:25,467 --> 02:37:26,788
[SPEAKER_03]: And I quote, yeesh.

2009
02:37:31,719 --> 02:37:34,600
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, sorry.

2010
02:37:34,920 --> 02:37:38,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Jaded2004 says, F you to Loki for singing Britney Spears.

2011
02:37:41,441 --> 02:37:43,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you be giving me the F you.

2012
02:37:43,522 --> 02:37:44,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Blame Rob.

2013
02:37:44,322 --> 02:37:47,003
[SPEAKER_13]: They're the ones that said, sing Britney Spears.

2014
02:37:47,223 --> 02:37:48,823
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even want to play the game, okay?

2015
02:37:50,604 --> 02:37:51,124
[SPEAKER_03]: Love you, Loki.

2016
02:37:52,104 --> 02:37:56,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Jaded2004 also says, F you Michigan for having winters too cold.

2017
02:37:57,176 --> 02:38:02,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Legend of Zaku says, F you to Chartwells, the food supplier for my campus, for making me gain 20 pounds.

2018
02:38:02,677 --> 02:38:04,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because they forced you to eat all that food.

2019
02:38:06,138 --> 02:38:06,858
[SPEAKER_03]: They forced you.

2020
02:38:07,238 --> 02:38:07,618
[SPEAKER_16]: Freshman 15.

2021
02:38:07,778 --> 02:38:10,959
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to my, or in my case, freshman 30.

2022
02:38:11,019 --> 02:38:16,981
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to my campus for giving me a shitty apartment that leaks water from the ceilings when it rains heavily.

2023
02:38:17,021 --> 02:38:18,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Now there we go, that's valid.

2024
02:38:19,077 --> 02:38:22,599
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to having to give up my PlayStation so that it can be sent to Peru.

2025
02:38:23,219 --> 02:38:29,082
[SPEAKER_03]: And F you to my shitty stamina contributed to my weight problem for giving me more greats and not enough perfects.

2026
02:38:29,142 --> 02:38:29,782
[SPEAKER_03]: I hear you on that one.

2027
02:38:31,483 --> 02:38:35,065
[SPEAKER_03]: MJB says my F you of the week goes to my goddamn hair cutress.

2028
02:38:35,903 --> 02:38:44,767
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never heard a haircutress who cut my hair extremely short after I repeatedly told her to only trim it and not to cut it very much.

2029
02:38:44,807 --> 02:38:45,727
[SPEAKER_03]: You goddamn bitch.

2030
02:38:45,807 --> 02:38:47,608
[SPEAKER_03]: My friends don't even recognize me anymore.

2031
02:38:47,668 --> 02:38:48,628
[SPEAKER_03]: My hair is so short.

2032
02:38:48,968 --> 02:38:52,630
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you collapse, you stupid bitch.

2033
02:38:55,051 --> 02:39:00,213
[SPEAKER_03]: Ziz says F you to Konami for making Ultramix 2's doubles sucks.

2034
02:39:01,133 --> 02:39:02,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Suck, not sucks.

2035
02:39:03,391 --> 02:39:09,956
[SPEAKER_03]: I changed my FU to FU to everyone at 8 on the break for being better than me and doing better in the tournament.

2036
02:39:10,276 --> 02:39:11,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Being better in the group.

2037
02:39:12,358 --> 02:39:16,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't send me a message that says I changed my FU because it doesn't work.

2038
02:39:16,461 --> 02:39:17,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I read from the top down.

2039
02:39:17,562 --> 02:39:20,044
[SPEAKER_03]: So you think before you hit that enter key, boys and girls.

2040
02:39:21,825 --> 02:39:27,230
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Ranma S says I only got two lines of his.

2041
02:39:27,290 --> 02:39:31,513
[SPEAKER_03]: Something about having the cash to pay for that damn cubic zirconia engagement ring.

2042
02:39:33,988 --> 02:39:34,708
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I got.

2043
02:39:36,629 --> 02:39:41,011
[SPEAKER_03]: Flareone says, F you to Konami of Hawaii's obsession with the dancing character Lady.

2044
02:39:43,772 --> 02:39:45,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Where is slutty Emi?

2045
02:39:45,192 --> 02:39:46,113
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I want to know.

2046
02:39:48,914 --> 02:39:51,615
[SPEAKER_03]: DidiArcoholic says, F you for not having FUs.

2047
02:39:51,855 --> 02:39:53,296
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to Loki for yelling at me.

2048
02:39:53,856 --> 02:39:56,057
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to not having enough time to come down to the show with you guys.

2049
02:39:56,457 --> 02:39:59,078
[SPEAKER_03]: And F you to Loki for yelling at me for actually having FUs.

2050
02:40:00,965 --> 02:40:04,731
[SPEAKER_03]: and JazzSaysFUtoWindowsServicePack2 for eating my windows.

2051
02:40:11,314 --> 02:40:17,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Ranma S got cut off, so I feel bad for him, but he might send it in, and then we'll figure that out.

2052
02:40:17,819 --> 02:40:19,560
[SPEAKER_03]: He says he's going to resend, so we'll see.

2053
02:40:20,141 --> 02:40:22,062
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's too long, though, I'm cutting it short.

2054
02:40:22,562 --> 02:40:27,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we're going to go to a break, and when we come back, let's give away some MIDI Head CDs, and play some MIDI Head songs as well.

2055
02:40:27,786 --> 02:40:29,147
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that sounds like a plan.

2056
02:40:29,367 --> 02:40:29,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

2057
02:40:30,568 --> 02:40:34,211
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's play some stuff from, I don't know, what sounds good to you guys?

2058
02:40:34,251 --> 02:40:36,513
[SPEAKER_03]: How about some poppin'?

2059
02:40:36,533 --> 02:40:37,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

2060
02:40:38,534 --> 02:40:39,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do some poppin'.

2061
02:40:39,495 --> 02:40:40,536
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to hear some Goonies.

2062
02:40:41,618 --> 02:40:42,324
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do Goonies.

2063
02:40:42,445 --> 02:40:43,635
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be back after this break.

2064
02:42:24,703 --> 02:42:25,424
[SPEAKER_13]: and many more.

2065
02:43:03,080 --> 02:43:04,046
Thanks for watching!

2066
02:43:34,203 --> 02:43:34,969
Thanks for watching!

2067
02:44:22,443 --> 02:44:32,150
[SPEAKER_22]: please listen to Orange Lounge Radio because real radio makes Captain Jack cry we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio

2068
02:44:36,329 --> 02:44:42,231
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we're going to do is we're going to give away some of those MIDI head CDs.

2069
02:44:42,251 --> 02:44:44,012
[SPEAKER_03]: He's releasing them under the name Monolithic.

2070
02:44:44,452 --> 02:44:49,093
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's all down to Iguana Girl and Islander, our buddies from DDR Freak.

2071
02:44:49,113 --> 02:44:51,834
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to be picking the winners inadvertently in their own little way.

2072
02:44:52,234 --> 02:44:56,116
[SPEAKER_03]: I just need you on that little slip of paper to write a number between one and this many.

2073
02:44:58,997 --> 02:45:00,897
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, write a number between one and that many.

2074
02:45:03,118 --> 02:45:03,458
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2075
02:45:05,179 --> 02:45:08,662
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to find out who won some free stuff.

2076
02:45:11,825 --> 02:45:12,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, you guys ready?

2077
02:45:12,446 --> 02:45:13,847
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you guys didn't put down the same number.

2078
02:45:14,307 --> 02:45:14,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, good.

2079
02:45:15,228 --> 02:45:17,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Iguana Girl, what number did you put?

2080
02:45:17,550 --> 02:45:18,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Number seven.

2081
02:45:18,791 --> 02:45:19,412
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

2082
02:45:19,552 --> 02:45:22,115
[SPEAKER_03]: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

2083
02:45:22,195 --> 02:45:25,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks like Rychan won our first CD.

2084
02:45:25,558 --> 02:45:26,859
[SPEAKER_03]: He's going to win a free MIDI head CD.

2085
02:45:26,899 --> 02:45:27,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Good job, Rychan.

2086
02:45:27,580 --> 02:45:28,340
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be contacting you.

2087
02:45:28,781 --> 02:45:30,302
[SPEAKER_03]: And Islander, what's your number?

2088
02:45:31,043 --> 02:45:31,263
[SPEAKER_01]: Six.

2089
02:45:32,166 --> 02:45:36,250
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we're going to give that one to Legend of Zaku on that one.

2090
02:45:36,330 --> 02:45:37,211
[SPEAKER_03]: So good job, guys.

2091
02:45:37,732 --> 02:45:38,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations.

2092
02:45:39,493 --> 02:45:40,975
[SPEAKER_03]: More free stuff in the future.

2093
02:45:41,035 --> 02:45:50,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, if you want to try and get some stuff from Midihead's site, you can always visit his site, www.midihead.com, and he's doing some download stuff.

2094
02:45:50,704 --> 02:45:51,525
[SPEAKER_03]: So go beg.

2095
02:45:51,665 --> 02:45:55,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Go beg and plead and just prod around the site.

2096
02:45:57,062 --> 02:45:58,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, good job you guys.

2097
02:45:58,083 --> 02:46:02,687
[SPEAKER_03]: They're celebrating in chat right now.

2098
02:46:02,727 --> 02:46:03,767
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be contacting you guys.

2099
02:46:03,847 --> 02:46:04,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't call us, we'll call you.

2100
02:46:04,928 --> 02:46:08,291
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do need to get your addresses in a little bit, so we'll be contacting you shortly.

2101
02:46:09,272 --> 02:46:09,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

2102
02:46:12,054 --> 02:46:12,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

2103
02:46:12,554 --> 02:46:14,436
[SPEAKER_03]: How about some Ask Orange Lounge, you guys?

2104
02:46:15,458 --> 02:46:16,178
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a little time here.

2105
02:46:16,198 --> 02:46:17,799
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to open up the Skype line as well.

2106
02:46:17,819 --> 02:46:22,660
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys want to call in over on www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on Interact With Us.

2107
02:46:22,700 --> 02:46:28,102
[SPEAKER_03]: But first, I have to get some FUs of the Week in, some that got forgotten there.

2108
02:46:28,182 --> 02:46:33,004
[SPEAKER_03]: Sigurd tried to send me an FU of the Week three times, and I don't know why, but it's broken.

2109
02:46:33,064 --> 02:46:33,724
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't work right.

2110
02:46:34,084 --> 02:46:36,645
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's broken.

2111
02:46:37,025 --> 02:46:42,187
[SPEAKER_03]: But he had some choice words for some of the people complaining about the game he worked on.

2112
02:46:43,208 --> 02:46:44,308
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's just leave it at that.

2113
02:46:45,942 --> 02:46:49,423
[SPEAKER_03]: I told him I would call him, but he doesn't want to.

2114
02:46:49,924 --> 02:46:50,364
[SPEAKER_03]: He's shy.

2115
02:46:51,344 --> 02:46:52,745
[SPEAKER_03]: But DJ Ranma S had another one.

2116
02:46:52,785 --> 02:46:56,366
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, a giant F you to that stupid bitch that whined about the Black Friday sale.

2117
02:46:56,446 --> 02:46:58,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Another F you to the lady who called me lazy.

2118
02:46:58,827 --> 02:47:00,928
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I flipped you off in front of everyone there.

2119
02:47:01,308 --> 02:47:04,229
[SPEAKER_03]: And finally, a giant F you to my former roommate for getting married.

2120
02:47:04,289 --> 02:47:10,491
[SPEAKER_03]: By the time I'm done with suing your ass for throwing my shit out, you won't have the cash to pay for that damn cubic zirconia engagement ring.

2121
02:47:10,952 --> 02:47:12,172
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay, there we go.

2122
02:47:12,212 --> 02:47:13,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that was a ring.

2123
02:47:13,853 --> 02:47:14,533
[SPEAKER_08]: That makes sense.

2124
02:47:16,211 --> 02:47:17,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, good deal.

2125
02:47:17,972 --> 02:47:25,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so if you guys have a question for Ask Orange Lounge, you can just send that on in over private message to Sky right now.

2126
02:47:25,777 --> 02:47:27,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me just type that in chat there.

2127
02:47:27,958 --> 02:47:32,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Or can you tell them how to send me a message, if you wouldn't mind?

2128
02:47:32,861 --> 02:47:33,561
[SPEAKER_03]: In case they don't know.

2129
02:47:34,382 --> 02:47:36,683
[SPEAKER_03]: Meanwhile, we've got the theme music we've got to do here.

2130
02:47:38,083 --> 02:47:43,227
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're also going to take calls over Skype for this as well, if you guys want to call in our Skype line there.

2131
02:47:43,928 --> 02:47:44,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Type, type, type.

2132
02:47:54,949 --> 02:47:57,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

2133
02:47:58,412 --> 02:48:01,635
[SPEAKER_03]: What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

2134
02:48:02,195 --> 02:48:05,378
[SPEAKER_03]: One question I'd like to know is why is Loki so bitter?

2135
02:48:05,778 --> 02:48:09,021
[SPEAKER_03]: He threw a fit and now I'm afraid he's going to kill me in my sleep.

2136
02:48:15,487 --> 02:48:15,967
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2137
02:48:17,850 --> 02:48:23,134
[SPEAKER_03]: First question for Ask Orange Lounge is, actually we don't have any yet because there's a delay.

2138
02:48:23,575 --> 02:48:25,516
[SPEAKER_03]: And I forgot to announce this before the previous break.

2139
02:48:25,536 --> 02:48:27,578
[SPEAKER_03]: So we don't have any questions over private message just yet.

2140
02:48:27,958 --> 02:48:31,301
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was going to open it up if anybody else had any questions for anyone else.

2141
02:48:34,123 --> 02:48:34,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything?

2142
02:48:34,823 --> 02:48:35,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything?

2143
02:48:35,484 --> 02:48:37,145
[SPEAKER_16]: They're too busy playing DS.

2144
02:48:38,766 --> 02:48:40,528
[SPEAKER_03]: DDR Angel, I have a question for you then.

2145
02:48:41,548 --> 02:48:45,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Why the F did you come over here if you're just going to play DS all night?

2146
02:48:47,173 --> 02:48:49,555
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm fully paying attention, Mr. Man.

2147
02:48:49,655 --> 02:48:50,155
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just teasing.

2148
02:48:50,195 --> 02:48:52,117
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm giving you a hard time.

2149
02:48:52,377 --> 02:48:52,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Where have you been?

2150
02:48:52,957 --> 02:48:54,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Just busy with school and stuff?

2151
02:48:54,439 --> 02:49:00,744
[SPEAKER_09]: Busy with school and couldn't get rides and stuff, so, you know, stuff happens.

2152
02:49:01,705 --> 02:49:09,311
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm here this week, and hopefully I can come the next couple weeks, and it'll be just like old times.

2153
02:49:10,256 --> 02:49:10,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds good to me.

2154
02:49:10,937 --> 02:49:13,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, now we're getting some questions from chat.

2155
02:49:14,359 --> 02:49:17,902
[SPEAKER_03]: MPQ wants to know, why does Bomani suck so much in this state?

2156
02:49:18,782 --> 02:49:21,744
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what state he lives in, so it's a little hard for me to comment.

2157
02:49:22,865 --> 02:49:30,551
[SPEAKER_03]: I could assume he lives in, I don't know... I guess, or... Because I don't read minds, unfortunately.

2158
02:49:30,651 --> 02:49:33,313
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I could guess, but I think he said he was on the East Coast.

2159
02:49:33,333 --> 02:49:34,834
[SPEAKER_08]: Because your state has it out for you.

2160
02:49:37,346 --> 02:49:38,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, he says Washington.

2161
02:49:38,406 --> 02:49:44,248
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't Washington where GameWorks is and all the Seattle people that have a lot of good stuff up there?

2162
02:49:45,248 --> 02:49:46,309
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe he doesn't live near there.

2163
02:49:46,349 --> 02:49:46,729
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

2164
02:49:47,069 --> 02:49:49,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's the blanket answer for that question.

2165
02:49:49,770 --> 02:49:54,011
[SPEAKER_03]: If you think the state of Bomani sucks in your state, buy the home mixes.

2166
02:49:54,431 --> 02:49:55,171
[SPEAKER_03]: There's one option.

2167
02:49:55,411 --> 02:49:58,432
[SPEAKER_03]: They put those out for a reason so you can play in the comfort of your own home.

2168
02:49:58,452 --> 02:50:04,774
[SPEAKER_03]: If you still don't like it, get some of your friends together, professionally approach the management at your local arcade and say, hey,

2169
02:50:05,294 --> 02:50:12,944
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got an idea for a game that would bring you guys money and emphasize money and visiting frequently.

2170
02:50:13,345 --> 02:50:16,989
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you don't like the situation, you can take control in your own hands and do something about it.

2171
02:50:17,871 --> 02:50:19,393
[SPEAKER_03]: So just a thought for you guys.

2172
02:50:21,756 --> 02:50:22,016
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2173
02:50:22,401 --> 02:50:25,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Dark Knight says, what are your guys' Christmas wishes this year?

2174
02:50:49,749 --> 02:50:51,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody care to answer a Christmas wish?

2175
02:50:51,610 --> 02:50:53,271
[SPEAKER_20]: I wish for world peace.

2176
02:50:54,612 --> 02:50:55,593
[SPEAKER_20]: I need new clothes.

2177
02:50:55,753 --> 02:50:56,513
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to get laid.

2178
02:50:57,094 --> 02:50:57,514
Just kidding.

2179
02:50:58,815 --> 02:51:06,219
[SPEAKER_03]: No, my Christmas wish is just, I would like to just have enough time to hang out with all my friends.

2180
02:51:06,259 --> 02:51:07,200
[SPEAKER_03]: I want a lot of parties.

2181
02:51:07,300 --> 02:51:08,580
[SPEAKER_03]: I want a lot of holiday parties.

2182
02:51:08,660 --> 02:51:09,841
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my Christmas wish.

2183
02:51:09,961 --> 02:51:10,842
[SPEAKER_03]: I want holiday parties.

2184
02:51:11,522 --> 02:51:13,883
[SPEAKER_03]: And that can be Christmas, New Year's, and year-round, really.

2185
02:51:13,924 --> 02:51:14,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Just throw parties all year-round.

2186
02:51:15,645 --> 02:51:16,045
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

2187
02:51:16,365 --> 02:51:18,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Angel, did you have something you wanted to add to that, your Christmas wish?

2188
02:51:18,956 --> 02:51:19,496
[SPEAKER_09]: I got mine.

2189
02:51:21,237 --> 02:51:21,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, what's that?

2190
02:51:21,697 --> 02:51:35,842
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, DS, but, uh, I already got it, and, well, I don't really know what I want besides, uh, the Karaoke Revolution 2 and 3, which I haven't gotten yet, and, uh, Ultra Mix 2.

2191
02:51:37,863 --> 02:51:42,485
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, the rest has to come later, because it's more expensive, like, uh, Ace Style and, uh, 10th

2192
02:51:44,926 --> 02:51:46,628
[SPEAKER_03]: I do really want 8th style and poppin' 10.

2193
02:51:46,688 --> 02:51:47,789
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just going to be a little while there.

2194
02:51:48,789 --> 02:51:49,230
[SPEAKER_03]: What can you do?

2195
02:51:50,270 --> 02:51:52,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody else want to share anything they want for Christmas this year?

2196
02:51:53,433 --> 02:51:54,554
[SPEAKER_06]: I need clothes.

2197
02:51:55,555 --> 02:51:58,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, certificates to any store would be nice, like Target.

2198
02:52:02,280 --> 02:52:02,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Exquisite.

2199
02:52:03,481 --> 02:52:04,502
[SPEAKER_18]: Anything priceless.

2200
02:52:05,642 --> 02:52:06,984
[SPEAKER_18]: Another bumper for my car.

2201
02:52:07,864 --> 02:52:08,385
[SPEAKER_18]: Ha ha ha ha!

2202
02:52:10,334 --> 02:52:14,538
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like lessons for all those who can't drive.

2203
02:52:14,698 --> 02:52:17,420
[SPEAKER_03]: That is my Christmas wish.

2204
02:52:19,221 --> 02:52:21,123
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we have a question from Illusion.

2205
02:52:21,843 --> 02:52:22,624
[SPEAKER_04]: This is great.

2206
02:52:23,284 --> 02:52:23,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen to this one.

2207
02:52:24,685 --> 02:52:28,708
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you deal with Sigurd's sweet ass anytime he comes on?

2208
02:52:29,489 --> 02:52:31,451
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it hard keeping your hands off of it?

2209
02:52:33,712 --> 02:52:34,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

2210
02:52:35,534 --> 02:52:36,054
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

2211
02:52:36,094 --> 02:52:37,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Sigurd's just a friend.

2212
02:52:38,729 --> 02:52:40,650
[SPEAKER_03]: You know he's just a friend.

2213
02:52:41,010 --> 02:52:47,172
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, baby, you got what I need.

2214
02:52:48,293 --> 02:52:51,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you want to grab your brother's sweet ass?

2215
02:52:51,374 --> 02:52:52,194
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

2216
02:52:52,334 --> 02:52:54,455
[SPEAKER_08]: You may if you live in Alabama.

2217
02:52:55,235 --> 02:52:58,536
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have these sweet ass feelings towards Sigurd.

2218
02:52:58,916 --> 02:53:00,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have sweet ass Sigurd feelings, one girl?

2219
02:53:01,725 --> 02:53:02,746
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't, I'm sorry.

2220
02:53:03,327 --> 02:53:06,589
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that's going to be heartbreaking for him, but I don't.

2221
02:53:07,410 --> 02:53:07,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Islander?

2222
02:53:07,950 --> 02:53:08,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Never have.

2223
02:53:09,111 --> 02:53:11,093
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, how do you resist Sigurd's sweet ass?

2224
02:53:12,074 --> 02:53:13,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Quite easily, I'm straight.

2225
02:53:17,819 --> 02:53:18,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, moving on.

2226
02:53:20,000 --> 02:53:23,843
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Ranma S says, do you guys want a holiday card for me?

2227
02:53:24,604 --> 02:53:24,824
Yes.

2228
02:53:25,885 --> 02:53:27,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Certainly, of course we want a holiday.

2229
02:53:27,206 --> 02:53:28,187
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll put it up on our wall.

2230
02:53:28,427 --> 02:53:29,228
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a little wall here.

2231
02:53:29,921 --> 02:53:31,482
[SPEAKER_03]: Legend of Zaku says, you're on that DDR diet, right?

2232
02:53:31,502 --> 02:53:32,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Legend of Zaku says, you're on that DDR diet, right?

2233
02:53:59,907 --> 02:54:06,412
[SPEAKER_03]: I need help planning a regimen for dropping 20 pounds, aka what songs and or Oni courses must I do to really start shedding weight?

2234
02:54:07,344 --> 02:54:08,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, here's my honest answer to the question.

2235
02:54:08,705 --> 02:54:11,446
[SPEAKER_03]: There's really no set songs or choruses to do.

2236
02:54:11,506 --> 02:54:13,347
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no, like, super weight loss plan.

2237
02:54:13,687 --> 02:54:16,549
[SPEAKER_03]: My suggestion is if you're going to play non-stops, play the long ones.

2238
02:54:16,669 --> 02:54:21,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Play 7 to 10, because the more you take breaks in between songs, the less your cardio is going to go.

2239
02:54:21,331 --> 02:54:22,912
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the main thing is cardio.

2240
02:54:22,972 --> 02:54:27,094
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to focus on doing at least a good 20 minutes of non-stop cardio.

2241
02:54:27,454 --> 02:54:31,937
[SPEAKER_08]: Even if that means doing something as simple as just, you know, a basic endless.

2242
02:54:32,217 --> 02:54:34,358
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, even then you're going to be burning calories.

2243
02:54:34,978 --> 02:54:35,598
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

2244
02:54:55,583 --> 02:54:56,004
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

2245
02:55:13,113 --> 02:55:16,035
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be my suggestion if you really want more exercise.

2246
02:55:16,055 --> 02:55:20,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Because DDR, it gives you a really good workout, but, you know, I think you can enhance it.

2247
02:55:20,457 --> 02:55:22,278
[SPEAKER_03]: You can make it better by doing other little things, too.

2248
02:55:22,298 --> 02:55:26,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Buy, like, a little set of those mini five-pound hand weights or something like that.

2249
02:55:27,340 --> 02:55:27,660
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.

2250
02:55:27,700 --> 02:55:28,501
[SPEAKER_08]: And work out with those.

2251
02:55:29,641 --> 02:55:31,542
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

2252
02:55:31,862 --> 02:55:33,603
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2253
02:55:33,623 --> 02:55:36,144
[SPEAKER_06]: To be honest, I was going to say, if you have a Max 3, I'll play Pop 8.

2254
02:55:37,125 --> 02:55:41,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Dojo Max says, when will DDR Max 3 come out?

2255
02:55:42,111 --> 02:55:44,531
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard Naoki is producing it in a secret basement.

2256
02:55:44,611 --> 02:55:45,172
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this true?

2257
02:55:47,112 --> 02:55:48,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Chances are, no, that's not true.

2258
02:55:48,792 --> 02:55:53,353
[SPEAKER_03]: We would probably... Don't believe anything unless we report it.

2259
02:55:53,433 --> 02:55:53,533
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

2260
02:55:54,073 --> 02:55:58,934
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless Konami's official site says something, there's really nothing you can do.

2261
02:55:59,634 --> 02:56:00,494
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all speculation.

2262
02:56:00,854 --> 02:56:04,255
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do think if a new DDR at this point comes out, it's not going to be called Max 3.

2263
02:56:04,775 --> 02:56:05,775
[SPEAKER_03]: It will be called something else.

2264
02:56:06,115 --> 02:56:07,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Max 3 was extreme.

2265
02:56:07,956 --> 02:56:09,436
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you missed DDR Extreme, but...

2266
02:56:10,546 --> 02:56:13,848
[SPEAKER_03]: I think if they do do a new DDR, honestly, here's my suggestion.

2267
02:56:15,148 --> 02:56:17,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Konami, if you're listening, feel free to take this.

2268
02:56:18,270 --> 02:56:21,511
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to do a new DDR, you're going to do a new hardware thing, right?

2269
02:56:21,591 --> 02:56:26,133
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're probably going to spice it up a little bit, make it a little more like 2DX, like bigger, badder, better thing, right?

2270
02:56:26,413 --> 02:56:27,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's my suggestion.

2271
02:56:28,014 --> 02:56:29,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Dance Dance Revolution 2.

2272
02:56:35,297 --> 02:56:36,137
[SPEAKER_03]: It's as simple as that.

2273
02:56:36,657 --> 02:56:37,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, interesting name.

2274
02:56:38,991 --> 02:56:41,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Just Dance Dance Revolution 2.

2275
02:56:41,812 --> 02:56:44,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Question on behalf of Dark Child through DDArcoholic.

2276
02:56:45,194 --> 02:56:46,675
[SPEAKER_03]: And this will be the last question for tonight, you guys.

2277
02:56:47,015 --> 02:56:50,457
[SPEAKER_03]: If Dark Child was gay, would Sky sleep with him?

2278
02:56:52,878 --> 02:56:53,118
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

2279
02:56:53,779 --> 02:56:56,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, that's going to do it for Ask Orange Lounge tonight.

2280
02:56:56,460 --> 02:57:00,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you guys very much for your questions tonight and participating.

2281
02:57:01,010 --> 02:57:06,235
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought, but not before we get in a plug for the rest of the week's programming.

2282
02:57:06,576 --> 02:57:11,681
[SPEAKER_03]: Monday night, tune in to Diversion, the Orange Lounge Radio remix show, right here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2283
02:57:11,721 --> 02:57:17,006
[SPEAKER_03]: All your favorite Bomani remixes, official, fan-made ones, and yes, remixes done in Acid are okay.

2284
02:57:17,227 --> 02:57:18,027
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay!

2285
02:57:18,087 --> 02:57:19,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Tuesday night, Dark Sakura.

2286
02:57:19,489 --> 02:57:24,354
[SPEAKER_03]: I do believe she's back this Tuesday, and she's going to be doing... She's not going to be back until way late, though.

2287
02:57:24,574 --> 02:57:28,557
[SPEAKER_03]: So, there'll be a rerun of Pump Up the Volume, ready to go.

2288
02:57:28,677 --> 02:57:30,678
[SPEAKER_03]: So, likely we're going to get a rerun of Pump Up the Volume.

2289
02:57:30,698 --> 02:57:36,383
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's a good show, and you should tune in, you know, and check out what it's all about if you haven't listened before, because it'll be new to you.

2290
02:57:36,803 --> 02:57:39,425
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Tuesday nights, about 7.30, Pump Up the Volume.

2291
02:57:40,265 --> 02:57:43,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Thursday nights, I'm sorry, Wednesday nights are the classic episodes of Orange Lingerie.

2292
02:57:43,648 --> 02:57:53,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Thursday nights, myself, Rice Princess, and LikeyStyle, we're back from our Thanksgiving holiday this week with Outside the Box, all that other video gaming chat that doesn't quite fit into the Bomani Spectrum.

2293
02:57:54,096 --> 02:57:59,318
[SPEAKER_03]: and then Friday night over on the Freak or DDR Freak Radio Orange Lounge Radio Rewind.

2294
02:57:59,738 --> 02:58:03,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Hear the same shit over again but it's just as good the second time you guys.

2295
02:58:04,439 --> 02:58:05,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially when you missed some of it.

2296
02:58:05,800 --> 02:58:07,020
[SPEAKER_08]: That filling tastes great.

2297
02:58:07,160 --> 02:58:07,300
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

2298
02:58:08,160 --> 02:58:12,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so that's it for the programming and now we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought.

2299
02:58:12,862 --> 02:58:14,862
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll start with Islander because he has a microphone over there.

2300
02:58:17,663 --> 02:58:18,463
[SPEAKER_06]: Final thoughts.

2301
02:58:19,784 --> 02:58:21,024
[SPEAKER_06]: Quit your bitching and just accept it.

2302
02:58:22,845 --> 02:58:23,165
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

2303
02:58:23,365 --> 02:58:23,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Very stern.

2304
02:58:25,442 --> 02:58:26,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Angel, your final thought.

2305
02:58:28,365 --> 02:58:29,526
[SPEAKER_09]: Mario sucks.

2306
02:58:30,166 --> 02:58:30,727
[SPEAKER_09]: No, just kidding.

2307
02:58:31,728 --> 02:58:33,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Aguana Girl, your final thought.

2308
02:58:35,210 --> 02:58:37,793
[SPEAKER_08]: I really want to know what's wrong with my car, please.

2309
02:58:39,854 --> 02:58:40,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Exquisite.

2310
02:58:42,056 --> 02:58:48,001
[SPEAKER_18]: Drivers must get... Stupid drivers must get the actual driver how to drive.

2311
02:58:49,142 --> 02:58:50,603
[SPEAKER_18]: God motherfucking dammit.

2312
02:58:51,604 --> 02:58:52,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, your final thought.

2313
02:58:54,704 --> 02:59:12,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Go to midihead.com, buy the albums, and you get access to this kickass shit that I'm downloading right now, which is more songs, not on his site, including the one that didn't win last week's, or not last week, a couple weeks ago's cage match, Speed Demons on there, but a lot of other ones.

2314
02:59:13,456 --> 02:59:17,158
[SPEAKER_04]: All on there for you lucky people that purchase albums.

2315
02:59:18,258 --> 02:59:23,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of Midi Head, and I'm so glad you mentioned it, stay tuned after the credits, because we're going to be playing that other Midi Head song.

2316
02:59:23,440 --> 02:59:25,941
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you liked that last one, you've got to check out this other new one.

2317
02:59:25,981 --> 02:59:27,242
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an unreleased track, I believe.

2318
02:59:27,282 --> 02:59:28,182
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called Deeper and Deeper.

2319
02:59:28,202 --> 02:59:30,103
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we're going to be hearing after the show.

2320
02:59:32,944 --> 02:59:39,527
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to mention that that track is inside the little special members area if you purchase an album.

2321
02:59:40,729 --> 02:59:41,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there you go.

2322
02:59:42,190 --> 02:59:42,510
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2323
02:59:43,210 --> 02:59:44,951
[SPEAKER_03]: So have a great night, everybody.

2324
02:59:44,991 --> 02:59:46,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much for listening.

2325
02:59:46,492 --> 02:59:51,715
