Muh, uh, muh, uh, muh, cocky.

00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:22,440

10
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,440
In this episode...

11
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,440

Orange Lounge Radio Live is a fully interactive program via our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com

13

14
00:01:48,440 --> 00:02:02,900
We are live, and this is episode number 120 for this, November the 28th of 2004.

15
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:06,420
My name is Rob Roberts, for you might know me as Skye, and joining me as always are my

16
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,420
awesome co-hosts.

17
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:12,880
In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, oh wait, she's not here, she's the happiest

18
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,460
bunny in Alabama right now, Jamie is on vacation night, the lovely dark sacra.

19
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:25,020
We do have in the other corner, our tech master Loki, I hate you already, the listeners don't

20
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:31,240
know what I have planned for tonight, listeners, tell Loki to listen to me, listen to what

21
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:38,120
I have to say because I know what's good for him and I know what's good for the show, anyway.

22
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:43,380
We don't have Darkstacker here with us tonight and there's no way in hell, in good decency

23
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:47,900
that anybody in the Bomani community would subject you to a Loki and Sky solo show. Some

24
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:53,300
kind guests have volunteered to fill in tonight. Please welcome from our friends over at DDR

25
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:58,340
Freak, Iguana Girl! Hello everybody! I'm so glad we could get a female perspective on

26
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:03,340
the show tonight, in the absence of Jamie. If you can't get Jamie, then you might as

27
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:10,220
much as you like me. You're a girl that plays games? Oh my god. Can I get your number? Sure,

28
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,460

35
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,720

Really big deal tonight, though, we have the Orange Lounge Radio, very first time we're

44
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:56,600

Diddle-daddle, shake and chat

60
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,520
Shoots in the breeze

61
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,520
Puddles, clacks, cadence, letters

62
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,520
There's a synchronous symphony

63
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,520
Play from the familiar

64
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,520
Kinda a synergise

65
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,520
Fidget in the mind

66
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,520
Enjoy cats with no regrets

67
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,520
Analyzing, hallucinations

68
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,520
Windows licking the imagination

69
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,520
Big incisions, shadows missing

70
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,520
Here's a synchronous symphony

71
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,520
Diddle daddle, change hats

72
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,520
Shoots in the breeze

73
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,520
Pat-a-clack, cadence slatters

74
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,520
Here's a synchronous symphony

75
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:12,520
And that's the end of the video, thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next one.

76
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:58,520
I'm holding on to all my fading memories Back to where it all began

77
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,020
So much there I understand

78
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,020
As I look now

79
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:09,020
To a distance far away

80
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:12,020
I will cross familiar lines

81
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,520
Now I'm standing still in time

82
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,520
Still in time

83
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:22,020
Still in time

84
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:25,520
Still in time

85
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,520
And we're still in time

86
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:59,200
Close your eyes, close your eyes and let it fly

87
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:06,200
You and I, together we can touch the sky

88
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,200
I was walking down the street

89
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,200
You came like the summer breeze

90
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,200
Sweeping my breath away

91
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,200
It doesn't happen every day

92
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,200
You and I together in the sky

93
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,200
Forever young, we can never die

94
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:34,200
Close your eyes, close your eyes and let us fly

95
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:41,200
You and I, together we can touch the sky

96
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,200
Close your eyes

97
00:08:44,200 --> 00:09:02,200
Close your eyes, close your eyes, close your eyes and let us fly

98
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:09,200
You and I, together we can touch the sky

99
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:15,700
Close your eyes, and let us fly

100
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,200
You and I

101
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,200
Together we can touch the sky

102
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:29,200
Close your eyes, and let us fly

103
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,200
You and I

104
00:09:32,200 --> 00:10:00,600
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 120 in progress, and our friends over

105
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:06,320
at Step Squad, sending us that little shout out there, that shout out is about two years

106
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,720
old, we need to get a new one.

107
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,000
We need to get a new Step Squad family gathering.

Squad.

110
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:22,380
Step Squad, it actually isn't really technically a DDR team per se, but it is at the same time.

111
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:29,000
It's more of a friends that were brought together by things like the money and anime, it just

112
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,560
has a very DDR tone. So it's not one of those like teams oh my god's lol gonna

113
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:38,080
kick your butt? Yeah, no it's not all about oh my god we have to win over you

114
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:45,840

133
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,460
I'm just going to turn to the person that's sitting in her chair right now.

134
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,980
I am the Jamie.

135
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,700
Does she know that you're sitting in her chair?

136
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,220
No, not at all.

137
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,340
And burping out?

138
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,420
And burping in her honor.

139
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,420
Alright.

140
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,060
Uh, Iguana Girl, why don't you start us off?

141
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,060
How was your week?

142
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,060
How was your day?

143
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:12,680
Um, my week was actually pretty good because I only had to go to school for two whole days

144
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,140
this week instead of, like, all week.

145
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:18,780
Which is really, really, really nice because I work 40 hour weeks.

146
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:25,100
Thanksgiving was nice but was tiring because we had to go to Ross's family's

147
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:29,580
Thanksgiving thing and then go to my family's Thanksgiving thing and split

148
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:34,900
the holiday and yada yada and then yesterday we spent all day getting Ross's

149
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:39,180
car fixed and and worked on and everything and then today we went to go

150
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:43,780
get my car fixed lo and behold imagine this look you should get a good kick out

151
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:52,860
this one afford with brake problems hmm familiar Wow concept no mine I still

152
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:56,560
haven't taken it in I because I thought I figured out what the problem was but

153
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,500
then I didn't I don't know what it is whenever I coast it makes a very loud

154
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:05,980
like growling noise like my car is angry that I'm driving it or something yeah

155
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:10,800
mine started whenever I it's like if I'm going low speeds anything like 20

156
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,360
miles per hour or below and then I proceed to brake it's starting to squeal

157
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,040
but if it's raining it won't squeal yeah my I don't know what the hell's wrong

158
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:24,560
but I'm thinking about taking it in but I would actually take it into the

159
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,600
dealership and have it looked at because they should do at least a brake

160
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:33,040
inspection for free yeah well I have the special warranty where anything's fucked

161
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:38,640
up with my car only cost me $25 yeah like let's just let the engine fall out

162
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:42,360
Unfortunately, I'm not that privileged.

163
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,200
I've already had fluids issues with my car, and now they don't know what's going wrong

164
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,340
with it, so it's all that fun.

165
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:51,200
And it's still squealing, even though they adjusted my brakes.

166
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,760
Ford fix or repair daily.

167
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:56,720
Yeah, but they're cheap, and that's the whole concept.

168
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,640
You buy a cheap car, you get a shoddy car, but it'll last a few years.

169
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,120
And you've made this comparison before, I've heard you do this, it's like talking about

170
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,840
the Mad Catz dance pads for DDR the $20 dance pads versus the you know $100

171
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:12,760
yeah I mean exactly if you're gonna pay for you know an ignition 2.0 you're

172
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,880
gonna get the quality of that it's gonna last a long time but you're gonna pay

173
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:20,280
out the ass for it but if you're gonna pay for the Mad Catz pad you have to

174
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:24,680
understand there's going to be some problems with it eventually had speedy

175
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:31,120
oil change not killed my car I wouldn't have this problem now would I but yeah

176
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,640
Yeah, so that's kind of frustrating, and that's how I spent my day, was being frustrating.

177
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:38,720
Oh, that's so funny. Well, take out your frustrations on our listeners.

178
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:44,200
Yeah! Damn you all! Damn you all to hell!

179
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:48,880
All right, anything else you want to share about your week, do you think?

180
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,520
Um, no. Okay. How was Thanksgiving?

181
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:56,800
I talked about that, but you weren't listening. I said I had to do the two-family thing. We

182
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,880
went to Ross's family's house, and then we went to my family's house.

183
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:06,720
I was prying to get that other story you were telling me I was doing that prying thing that

184
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,800
hosts do when they know that there's a topic that needs to be talked about but they don't

185
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:13,120
want to say that there's one.

186
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:19,840
What we did is we decided to bring all of our odd music games with us so we brought

187
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:28,340
our taiko drum master and donkey conga and karaoke revolution one two and three and we

188
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:34,140
We took them all over to my parents' house and I'm guessing my mom had a little bit too

189
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:40,060
much wine to drink because she was just having way too much fun on everything.

190
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:44,700
My mom, strange enough, if you know me, it's really, really unique.

191
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,940
My mom has absolutely no sense of rhythm whatsoever.

192
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:52,020
She is like the whitest white girl possible.

193
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,020
She tried to play taiko-chan.

194
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,020
I noticed it runs in the family.

195
00:15:55,020 --> 00:16:02,680
Couldn't resist. So she tried to play taiko drum master and

196
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:09,420
she got like a 58% on some one star easy song and just absolutely biffed it. So my brother-in-law

197
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:18,140
who's a drummer had to show her up and then after he did that my blind father took over

198
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:26,180
the drum, asked us to put it on a song, and proceeded to outplay my mother. He just started,

199
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:30,980
you know, doing this doon-doonch, doon-doonch, just this random beat. Because, again, he's

200
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:35,540
blind. He's blind. So he can't see the shots. He can't see what's going on on the screen.

201
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:41,060
He's blind and he's just playing whatever, and he's doing well with the damn game. I

202
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,420
I have no idea how.

203
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:49,500
And at one point he stopped randomly, but we got him to start back up again, and if

204
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:54,140
he hadn't stopped and gotten off of his little groove that he was in, he probably would have

205
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:58,820
passed the song, which is extremely scary.

206
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,920
But he ended up getting like a 48%.

207
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:05,640
He didn't beat my mom, but came within 10%, so I can now say that my blind father can

208
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,480
play taiko drum master.

209
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,480
Very nice.

210
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,700
You know, I think this was a topic once in DDR chit chat.

211
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:16,700
do you play DDR when you're blind? You don't! You just kind of stomp on all the arrows.

212
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:20,780
You just kind of dance in the rhythm and you'd be surprised how well you can do. I actually

213
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:27,780
have never had my dad play DDR but maybe I should. That might be fun. I don't know. I'm

214
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:31,820
thinking he would be good with Donkey Kong though too. Oh very cool. Yeah. Very cool.

215
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:36,420
Alright. That's about it. Alright we're going to move on. Let's talk to DDR Angel. How was

216
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:40,140
your week? How was your day? How does a blind person play DDR? Oh boy what did I just walk

217
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:45,060
into. Same crap you've been walking into for the past, what, year and a half? Almost two.

218
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:57,620
Yeah, exactly. Um, not much going on. I mean, had two days of school this week, and that was pretty good

219
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:08,420
because I really needed the break, just like I'm sure Jess did and all that. After school was over, just, you know,

220
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:13,420
Spent the last four days playing games that I haven't been able to play.

221
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:18,420
And I got my DS! Yay!

222
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:23,420
That took six stores to find and it was not

223
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:28,420
good until I walked away with it and it was all good.

224
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:33,420
Best Buy is not your friend unless you call all the stores in Sacramento.

225
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,420
I got my DS at Best Buy, what's your problem?

226
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,420
I had to call 6 stores, that was not cool.

227
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,420
Or however many stores we got, 4.

228
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,420
Yeah, so I got my DS and it's all good.

229
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:48,420
The minigames on Mario 64 are your friend.

230
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:53,420
Minigames on Mario 64 DS rock, they make that game worth it, they really do.

231
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:58,420
You just spend all your time playing the minigames rather than playing the actual game.

232
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,420
Favorite minigame so far?

233
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,420
The Bob-omb slingshot game.

234
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:07,420
I love that one. My other favorite one is the he-loves-me-he-loves-me-not.

235
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,420
Yes, yes.

236
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,420
It's gender neutral, isn't it?

237
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,420
It's just funny.

238
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,420
Loves-me-loves-me-not, that's it.

239
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,420
Uh-huh.

240
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,420
Go Yoshi.

241
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,420
It's so lame, yet so fun.

242
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,420
Alright.

243
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:21,420
We should get back on that blind DVR topic later.

244
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,420
Okay.

245
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,420
I have a reason for that, anyway.

246
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,420
Okay, maybe we will.

247
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,420
Okay.

248
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,420
Alright.

249
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,420
Cool.

250
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,420
Alright, yeah.

251
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,420
Islander, how was your week? How was your day?

252
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:34,740
Um, I was fine. Um, pretty much Jessica has already summed it up for those of you who

253
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:39,660
don't know, that I want a girl and I are a couple, duh.

254
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:43,180
Oh my god, it's a DDR couple. We are?

255
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:52,180
I thought you were just, like, sleeping in my bed for no fair reason.

256
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:59,180
This is a TFI alert. I thought you were just my sex slave, I don't

257
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:05,180
Hello, the TMI SWAT team's here.

258
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:16,180
But no, just spent the days off playing games that we bought because we kind of went crazy

259
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:25,180
and bought a shitload of games, including Taiko, Donkey Konga, oh shit, KR3.

260
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:28,180
You guys went on quite a little spending spree, didn't you?

261
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,180
Yeah...

262
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,180
We went a little crazy.

263
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,180
But we've been good.

264
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:35,620
A little crazy, rumble roses.

265
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:39,340
We've lost almost 80 pounds, we've earned it.

266
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:44,540
But yeah, just from playing all these games that I'm like, holy crap, I have new stuff

267
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,540
to play now.

268
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:48,340
So, just been doing a lot of that lately.

269
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,340
Very cool.

270
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,340
Very cool.

271
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,340
Anything else you want to share about your...

272
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,500
Um, let's see.

273
00:20:54,500 --> 00:21:01,500
Other than watching her blind father play taiko, I'm trying to think what else was pretty

274
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:08,820
remarkable this weekend. I think she pretty much covered everything.

275
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,020
Alright, fair enough then.

276
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:14,580
Loki, my friend, how was your week? How was your day?

277
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:21,580
Well, my week was okay because it was short. Work-wise it was short. We had a potluck on

278
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:27,900
like a potluck on wednesday and i had lots of food and didn't really do anything so that's cool um

279
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:35,900
then played final fantasy most of the week and then um what else oh just more ds crap um have

280
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:43,820
like 41 stars now in mario 64 and that game's frustrating as hell and um then i also bought

281
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:51,260
uh two new games i bought um alien hominid and under the skin and those are strange i love alien

282
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:40,260
It was full of like, turkey, and like, spaghetti, and now I have pizza. It's way too much food. And, I don't know, really other than that, not too much. Just trying to figure out how to spend my time during this 4-day weekend and I think I wasted most of it on Final Fantasy.

283
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:55,420
But anyways. Oh, and I got another game. However, due to foreshadowing I cannot reveal what

284
00:22:55,420 --> 00:23:03,580
game that would be. So, let me just say that first off that I don't know why I bought this

285
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:08,700
game and I think that there were powers that would be that would coerce me into doing so

286
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:17,520
against my will. In other words, his girlfriend said buy it or I'm not putting out. Which

287
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,840
by the way is very interesting when you consider his girlfriend is not a gamer at all. At all.

288
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:33,240
But yet she loves Mario 64 DS and she loves this game. But I love her so I forgive her.

289
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:38,640
She just likes to watch my suffering. She likes to watch?

290
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:47,640
She likes to participate, no. No, I don't know. Whatever. No. Alright, I'm done.

291
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:51,360
Well, uh, my week and my day. I gotta make this quick because I gotta get to a break

292
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,440
pretty soon here, but my week and my day was pretty cool. I went out to Roseau Golf Land

293
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:59,120
one night. I know, gasps. Which is the first time in months I've been there, and I know

294
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,120
we're an international show here, so for those of you guys that don't know what Roseau Golf

295
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:06,480
plan is. It's where Bamani games go to die, basically, and get disrepair. But they have

296
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,400
a brand new game called Derby Owners Club. We went out twice this weekend. And you've

297
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,440
heard me talk about this game on the show before. You've heard Jamie talk about this

298
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,640
game zillions of times on the show before. She loves this game. I love this game, too.

299
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:22,360
I made a brand new horse. I called her Britney Spears so I could whip her. And I was so proud

300
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:26,660
of Britney because she came in second in my first race. That's very proud. But where did

301
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:30,960
these people come from at Golf Land who know how to play Derby Owners Club all of a sudden?

302
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,960
Well, a lot of them come from UCD.

303
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,960
Yeah, I've seen a lot of UCD up there.

304
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,960
Man, I don't know what's going on with that.

305
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:42,960
And then also, I played DDR Extreme for the first time in a while.

306
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,960
Now, I've been slowly getting myself back into DDR, thanks to UltraMix 2 and what a kick-ass game it is,

307
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:52,960
and Extreme and what a solid game that was that kind of held me over for UltraMix 2.

308
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,960
That was good times. I've been playing those at home.

309
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,960
But I've not really played a game in the arcade in a long time,

310
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:02,480
So I kind of forgot what your ego can do to you when you're playing in the arcade is you want to kind of play

311
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:09,520
The hardest stuff possible, right? So I decided all right, I'm gonna play breakdown on heavy nine-footer right pretty fast

312
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,600
Absolutely failed didn't you failed one measure before the end?

313
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:18,000
Do you know how that feels to be on your last step before you can hit your last step?

314
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,560
Okay

315
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,880
If it makes you feel better I

316
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:28,280
I probably couldn't even pass anything past the seven footer at this point.

317
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:31,280
That's how long it's been so let's play DDR.

318
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,880
And yet I am the head administrator of

319
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,880
the largest DDR site in the world.

320
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:42,880
What the hell? I don't know. I don't get it myself.

321
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,240
It's the love of the game though. I mean honestly I could suck at DDR but

322
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,380
you know when games like Ultra Mix 2 come out I get in fanboy mode all over again.

323
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:53,140
No matter if I suck at the game and I'm getting older one.

324
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:57,140
But anyway, speaking of Ultramix 2, we gotta cut it short, we gotta go to a break, because when we come back from the break,

325
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:00,640
Midihead from Ultramix 2 is gonna be here on the program.

326
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,640
Very excited about that, so I want you guys to familiarize yourselves a little bit with Midihead,

327
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:10,140
in case you forgot, I don't know how you could, because it's one of the most kick-ass remixes we've had in a DDR game in a long time.

328
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:15,140
Remix of one of our favorite artists, Akira Yomoka, took his song, made it just...

329
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:21,640
I can't say made it better, but certainly not made it worse, just made it different and cool, is what he did.

330
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,000
And it's in my eyes, the MIDI head mix.

331
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,840
Check it out, and when we come back, MIDI head will be on

332
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,360
the program.

333
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:33,360
we'll be back

334
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:16,360
You're the light that makes me free That you're the need to bear

335
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:21,360
You are like an empty dream

336
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:28,360
You will never know what it can be

337
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:36,360
You are like an empty dream

338
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:43,360
You are like an empty dream

339
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:29,720
We are back.

340
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:33,200
That was, in my eyes, the MIDI Head Remix from UltraMix 2.

341
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,640
We are excited because we're going to have our very first interview with an actual artist

342
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,440
from DDR.

343
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,440
This is shocking.

344
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,440
I love it.

345
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,440
Alright?

346
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:45,880
buzz him up let's see if he's around let's call him up so I'm just gonna

347
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:55,560
punch in the magic digit it is I hello is this MIDI head it is I that that must

348
00:28:55,560 --> 00:29:01,840
be a yes hello welcome to Orange Lounge radio greetings hey how you doing you

349
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:07,600
know I'm doing great I'm just lounging around in my shorts I think we're in you

350
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:15,360
Being as if we are Southern California, it's actually kind of nippy outside, but here in

351
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,320
my studio it's nice and toasty.

352
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,680
It's been pretty cold up here too.

353
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:22,000
We are based out of Sacramento, so we are not that far away, we are just a stone's throw

354
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
away.

355
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,840
It's not cold up there, is it?

356
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,160
It's been freezing up here these past few days, don't you guys think so?

357
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,160
In the 40's during...

358
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:35,720
Have you guys ever been to New York City or Park City or any of those towns this time

359
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,720
of year?

360
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:41,360
Not this time of year, but I went there during the summer and that was bad enough this one

361
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,360
night.

362
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,360
You don't know cold, my friend.

363
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:48,360
That's why we live here.

364
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,360
That's why we live here.

365
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,360
We've been there.

366
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,360
That's why we live in California.

367
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,360
That's right.

368
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:56,880
You know, the folks that created Ultramix 2, they're over in Hawaii, so they've got

369
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,940
to be loving it year-round there.

370
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:05,360
They're getting the tropical moisture.

371
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,760
skin is all nice and young looking.

372
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,840
Except for the occasional tropical storm and things like that.

373
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,440
Yeah, who cares.

374
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,200
It's worth living in Hawaii for that.

375
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,200
Absolutely.

376
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,280
I would live there any old day of the week.

377
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:22,840
Speaking of Hawaii, I'm kind of curious, how did you become involved with those guys in

378
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:26,320
getting into DDR UltraMix II?

379
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:31,600
Well actually I called them on the phone one day and I bribed them and said I would give

380
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:38,840
them my wife and children would say, let me do the remix for them.

381
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,440
What will your wife and child be doing at Konami now?

382
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:51,200
Okay, now they are going to hear this and go, you sold it!

383
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:59,600
Basically what happened is I got contacted by my label, A Different Drone, and there

384
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:07,280
was a bulletin that went out to all of the artists on the label who said, hey, Konami

385
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:15,480
wants to do this remix and they also want tracks and missions for the UltraMix II game.

386
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:18,200
Anybody who's interested, here are the details.

387
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:28,220
So basically I just got the original tracks from Konami and it was kind of a free-for-all.

388
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:33,240
So I just did one and just kind of submitted it, not really thinking that it was going

389
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:37,360
to go anywhere.

390
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:43,160
Next thing I know I get a call from Jaron Tolman, who is one of their head sound designers

391
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:47,360
down there and he said, hey, Konami liked it so much they want you to do an extended

392
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,360
remix.

393
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:52,600
Oh, which is the one we see on the V-Rare, that super long mix, right?

394
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,600
Super long!

395
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,600
Super long!

396
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:59,480
Yeah, so that's how I got involved.

397
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,480
Very cool, very cool.

398
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,700
And there's lots of great music from a different drum, including UltraMix II.

399
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:07,900
And I gotta tell you, I don't know how much of the scene you've kind of been watching

400
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:12,320
and kind of the reaction from the DDR fans, but a lot of folks have been really into UltraMix

401
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:16,700
too, and they kind of credit a lot of the success of the game because of the song list

402
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:19,920
and because of a lot of the music that comes from a different drum.

403
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:24,020
Bands such as Echo Image, Day Behavior, and all those folks and yourself all coming over

404
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,020
from a different drum.

405
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,020
It's been great.

406
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,820
It's been a great collaboration.

407
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:32,580
I hope you guys work together more in the future.

408
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:38,460
I know that Konami has left the door open, so they've really liked what's come out of

409
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:44,580
a different drum and myself included.

410
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:54,620
What they are grateful for is the fact that they are not dealing with these prima donnas

411
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:57,020
on these larger labels.

412
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:59,980
They have all these demands.

413
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:04,740
We just want to get our music out there and get it to the fans.

414
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:09,540
Honestly, I would dance to Skulk, Close Your Eyes, the In My Eyes remix, I would dance

415
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:11,780
to that long before I danced to Britney.

416
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:12,780
On DDR.

417
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:18,460
You know, you say that now, but if Britney was now standing in front of you, with uh...

418
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:20,460
Nah, that's a good point, that's a good point.

419
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,460
Britney, I'm your biggest fan!

420
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,460
Come on, I know.

421
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:30,380
You'd be dancing to Britney all night if she was sitting right there in your recliner.

422
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,380
I got a point.

423
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:36,300
But speaking, since we're kind of talking about DDR here, did you know about DDR before

424
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,700
you became involved with the project?

425
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:38,700
Did you ever play it?

426
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,700
I mean, you mentioned you had a kid.

427
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:44,260
You know, I gotta tell you guys, this is gonna piss off some of your listeners, but...

428
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:48,340
That's alright, we piss them off and up.

429
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:58,180
You know, I used to be extremely into video games and found them to, it was kind of, I

430
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:05,700
I won't say it's a waste of time, but for me, it was like getting in the way of producing

431
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:11,100
albums and, you know, basically, since I have a family, I have to be a responsible adult

432
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:16,220
now, so I kind of got out of the whole video game thing.

433
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:20,420
I used to be, like, you know, heavily into, do you guys remember Descent?

434
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,420
Oh, yeah.

435
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,420
Oh, yeah.

436
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,420
Oh, yeah.

437
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,420
I used to play that, yeah.

438
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,420
Way back in the day.

439
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:44,420
Most recently I was heavily into the Quake 3 add-on mod, Urban Terror, so that is by far the best game I've played to date.

440
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:48,420
I've never played BDR though guys, I'm sorry.

441
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:55,420
That's alright, that's alright. You were talking some stuff to me before the show that I totally wasn't getting either, so now we're even, okay?

442
00:34:55,420 --> 00:35:03,420
We're even. But, you know, you sound like the kind of guy, though, that if you were still playing video games, you'd be playing Halo 2 with the rest of us right now, I think.

443
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:08,420
Yeah, I would be playing until my usual 4 or 5 o'clock in the morning.

444
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:12,420
And you would be getting your ass kicked by 13-year-olds, just like the rest of us do.

445
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:19,260
You know, what's funny is I actually had a 13-year-old show me some moves on Urban Terror

446
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:23,320
one night late when we had the whole entire board to ourselves while everybody else went

447
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,320
to bed.

448
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,720
It was kind of funny.

449
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:33,520
I'm 33 and this little 13-year-old is showing me stuff that I would have ever figured out

450
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,520
on my own.

451
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,520
Wow.

452
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,520
The kids these days.

453
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,520
I feel so old saying that myself.

454
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,520
Where is our youth going?

455
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,520
I feel so old saying that myself.

456
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,520
Where is our youth going?

457
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:51,520
Mideet, I want to ask you about the song that you specifically remixed, In My Eyes, a track originally done by Kiryamaoka.

458
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:58,520
You kind of mentioned that you had a lot of the original Konami tracks, so was it your choice to remix that particular song?

459
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:09,720
Yeah, you know, I think out of the two songs that I was given, that one kind of stuck out

460
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:15,760
the most because the chord progression, I knew right away what to do with it when I

461
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,760
heard it.

462
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:26,920
So I pretty much took out all of his musical elements, left the vocals, and just re-did

463
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:32,040
everything from the ground up yeah you can tell that like a lot it's not just

464
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,440
you know you took a song and added a new beat to it but you just totally kind of

465
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,840
deconstructed it and then built it from the ground up and I think that's part of

466
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:44,120
what's so great about it so yeah thank you no problem no problem anytime I have

467
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:47,120
you gotten a chance to talk to Akira about the remix so I don't know if you

468
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:53,720
got you know he and I talk every day well you know we got to talk to him one

469
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,560
time and unfortunately didn't we didn't get him on air we got to talk to him one

470
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:01,560
And I tell you we were just giddy little fanboys. It was just amazing. I don't know if you've ever played this.

471
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:06,560
No, actually, I haven't spoke to him. I have no idea how he feels about the remix whatsoever. No clue.

472
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,560
We should find out. We have ways of finding out.

473
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:16,560
For all I know, he thinks, you know, this is garbage. What has he done to my song? I don't know.

474
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:22,560
No, I'm sure he loves it. Trust me, there's been some remixes in DDR in the past that were absolute garbage.

475
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,560
Yours is not garbage. Don't worry about it.

476
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:29,560
Thank you. My head is swelling now. It's huge.

477
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,560
You're right. I need to stop.

478
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:35,560
What kind of equipment do you use to do these remixes in your studio?

479
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:39,560
Actually, I'm a big fan of...

480
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:43,560
See, this will all go over your head. We're back to the over-your-head thing.

481
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:46,560
Alright, that's fine. Maybe some of our listeners will catch up on it.

482
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:52,560
Okay. So, I actually use acid, and I'm not talking about white blotter.

483
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:57,120
Okay, now my co-host, Loki, is very familiar with ACID.

484
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,520
He does his own remixing in ACID.

485
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,520
So that I know.

486
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,520
I'm with you so far.

487
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,520
I'm with you so far.

488
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,520
Alright, cool, cool.

489
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:06,680
Well, you know, a lot of people have kind of raised their brow when I tell them that

490
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:12,720
because ACID is more of a loop construction tool, you know, according to the masses.

491
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:18,520
And actually I use it for tracking and, you know, doing a lot of really cool stuff.

492
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:21,520
I mean, I've been using it since the program first came out.

493
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,640
I want to point out, I'm sorry, I hate to cut you off, but I've got to say this, I've

494
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:29,840
got to say this, because there's been these amateur remix contests that have happened

495
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:33,440
throughout the Bamani scene that go on on such big websites and they want to get people

496
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:39,420
to remix stuff and they always say, don't use acid, because we want a program that is,

497
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:42,440
we want something that doesn't sound like two songs meshed together.

498
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:47,600
I would just like to point out, the pros have just said that they use acid.

499
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,800
So STFU guys, STFU.

500
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,440
Yeah, it's a great program, especially now in version 5.

501
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:00,100
But I use acid in conjunction with, you know, I do a lot of the elements live, so I don't

502
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,100
sequence much.

503
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:07,760
I actually just hit the record button and will just play the sequence at live.

504
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:14,640
If it's an arpeggiated piece, you know, that of course is sequenced, but most of it goes

505
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:19,320
live in acid, and then I just chop it up and dice it up and move stuff around, and it's

506
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,880
just a lot faster that way.

507
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:29,440
I use virtual instruments in addition to my AccessVirus KC, I have all the Spectrosonics

508
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:41,140
Stylus RMX, Atmosphere Trilogy, and of course I've got software from Vanguard, I use Vanguard

509
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:47,620
I played it in Zeta, and I love SoftSense.

510
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:50,420
Very cool. Now see, Loki's following you here. Maybe I should just...

511
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,020
It's alright.

512
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:56,260
See, well, I mean, you know, basically the stuff I do is very, very, very amateur.

513
00:39:56,260 --> 00:40:01,700
I mean, I'm not even going as far as calling them actual remixes, more of just white label remixes and stuff.

514
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:06,740
Because, you know, I don't really have the talent at the moment to be actually creating my own stuff.

515
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:10,740
Basically it's a lot of loop chopping and adding a little bit of elements that way.

516
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:15,740
But a lot of people just hate the fact that I'm not using Fruity Loops.

517
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,740
They think Fruity Loops is like a god program out there.

518
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:21,740
I don't know why, because it's... I don't know.

519
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:24,740
I've got to admit that I use Fruity Loops to program...

520
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:29,740
Sometimes I will program some beats in Fruity Loops.

521
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:34,740
It's great for that, but I can't construct an entire song in Fruity Loops.

522
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:36,740
I just love acid.

523
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:40,740
You love acid? Are you a permafry, my friend?

524
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,740
Yes, I guess.

525
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:49,740
You were mentioning that there was two songs that you were sent there.

526
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:54,740
Were there actually other songs that you remixed for DDR that didn't make it onto Ultra Mix 2?

527
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:59,740
No, come on now. Would I have remixed a song that wouldn't have made it on DDR?

528
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:03,720
Well, maybe I'm thinking maybe you're one of those artists that construct something

529
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:06,760
and then you go, no, it's crap, it's crap, and you throw it out.

530
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:12,100
No, no, no, no, no, man, I've been doing this since 1989.

531
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:15,860
That whole phase has been definitely worked out of me.

532
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:19,660
No, actually, this was the one song I remixed.

533
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:25,820
It was kind of a stab in the dark, and I threw it out there, and lo and behold.

534
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:27,500
Very cool, very cool.

535
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:30,940
You mentioned that you might be doing this again for another Konami project.

536
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:34,820
Do you see yourself being involved with a future Konami game?

537
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:37,060
Oh sure, yeah.

538
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:42,380
Nothing specific at the moment, but like I said earlier, the door's open and we've been

539
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:47,700
in talks about keeping in touch and doing more, so they've been really happy with this

540
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:50,100
last remix.

541
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:54,380
It's not just the remix, you have to look at the actual business side too, if you're

542
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:58,880
You're easy to deal with as an artist and this is just tips going out there to people

543
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,220
trying to get their foot in the door.

544
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:05,180
It's not just the quality of the work that you do.

545
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:08,620
It's also your attitude and your business dealings with these guys.

546
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:17,700
If you're professional from start to finish and you're very proficient and attentive,

547
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:22,420
a lot of people make great music but can't get work and it's because they don't have

548
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:27,920
the relationship thing down and you've got to be able to have a good working relationship

549
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,920
with these guys.

550
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,440
I absolutely agree.

551
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:35,080
That's why I am all about kissing ass on this program.

552
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:39,240
Did you get the chocolates I sent you, Midyhead?

553
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,240
What?

554
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,280
Did you get the chocolates we sent?

555
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,560
Yeah, exactly.

556
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:48,920
I have a brown nose too.

557
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:57,600
Now, if the folks that are listening go on over to your website over at www.midihead.com,

558
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:01,120
and I hope that they do because it's a great website, you notice that there's a lot of

559
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,720
other stuff that you've worked with before.

560
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:06,560
You did some TV gigs, you did some movie things in the past before.

561
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,920
But what I want to know, have you worked with video game music ever before?

562
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:10,920
Was this the first thing?

563
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:13,880
No, I've never worked with video game music before.

564
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:14,880
Oh, wow.

565
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:21,640
I moved out here to Los Angeles to try some things.

566
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:29,840
The first stuff I did was for Fox Television's Dark Angel.

567
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:35,560
When that happened I started landing tracks through my publisher in a lot of different

568
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:42,140
television shows and was able to get one landed in the Matrix Reloaded movie trailer just

569
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:45,980
part of the film's release.

570
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:48,260
That had been most of my experience.

571
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:52,020
I had looked into video games several times going, you know, I should do that.

572
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:53,020
I should get into that.

573
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:55,460
I had no idea how.

574
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:57,780
I had friends that were doing it.

575
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:03,100
I asked them how I would get involved and they said, you know, it's a nightmare trying

576
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:06,940
to get in there because so many people are trying to do it.

577
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:13,520
So I just never really pursued it because I always had other things that I had priorities

578
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,520
on doing.

579
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:21,040
So now, I just kind of knocked on my door for a change.

580
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:25,920
Hopefully there will be more stuff in the video game world because certainly there's

581
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:32,920
a huge market for it and from what I understand, the guys that are doing it and doing it well

582
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:36,280
are doing well themselves.

583
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:39,940
There are folks who actually were in Ultramix too that are quite familiar with the video

584
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:40,940
game music stuff.

585
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:44,260
Jesper Kidd I know is one of them and he's done a lot of previous video game stuff and

586
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:48,340
now he's kind of crossing over into DDR so you know there's lots of I think opportunities

587
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:52,420
for making great music for video games out there you know especially what they keep saying

588
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:57,500
it's getting bigger than movies now we'll see I mean who knows who knows all right um

589
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:01,300
I know you're going to be putting in a live appearance at this uh upcoming convention

590
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:06,540
this Otaku Con, is that what it's called? Yeah. What's going on with that? How'd you

591
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:13,500
get involved with that? Again, my label got involved in that. They were contacted, a different

592
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:22,020
drum was contacted by Otaku Con about having a different drum be involved and of course

593
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:29,620
because of my involvement in DDR, I was one of the first artists contacted to be in that.

594
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:32,340
The Otakus love DDR, just so you know.

595
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:33,340
Oh yeah, yeah.

596
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:37,540
So we'll be performing that track live on stage at the...

597
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:43,140
Just so you guys know, yeah, that's going to be in Miami Beach if any of you guys are

598
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:46,700
in that area or planning on traveling, and the convention's happening December 17th through

599
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:47,700
the 19th.

600
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:50,860
If you want to check out more information, it's otakukan.com, the MIDI head's going to

601
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:51,860
be there.

602
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:52,860
Cool.

603
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:57,060
I'll be there with some tasty babes up on stage, my friend.

604
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:58,060
Oh, even more!

605
00:45:58,060 --> 00:45:59,060
Yeah!

606
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:09,060
I always perform with tasty babes, you have to have the dual sex appeal.

607
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:12,380
Do they just get up on stage and kind of dance?

608
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:16,140
Well they actually do have talent.

609
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:19,380
I don't doubt it.

610
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:21,860
So they'll sing and play keyboards.

611
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:31,820
I've also got Lars Hausmann of Brave New World, but Lars Hausmann of Brave New World will

612
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:33,380
be joining me on stage.

613
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:34,380
Very cool.

614
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:35,380
Cool.

615
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:36,380
All right.

616
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:37,380
So bands coming together.

617
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:38,380
That would be awesome.

618
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:39,380
Bands coming together.

619
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:40,380
Lots of habit.

620
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,860
That's how it works with a different drum label.

621
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:47,100
A lot of the artists work together and collaborate on different projects.

622
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:48,100
It's really cool.

623
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:49,220
It's a great label to be involved in.

624
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:51,040
I'm kind of noticing that.

625
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:55,480
I'm kind of hoping that people are checking out A Different Drum over at adifferentdrum.com

626
00:46:55,480 --> 00:47:01,840
and just because everything they've done for DDR has been so great, and just, you know,

627
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:07,040
I really, to be honest, I had no clue a lot of this music was out there before DDR.

628
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:11,000
It was kind of like, because of my involvement with this show, I kind of, you know, when

629
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,460
this music was announced, I kind of went on over to the site and I was kind of checking

630
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:17,360
out some of the music by the artist, I was like, this stuff is great.

631
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:18,360
This stuff is really great.

632
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:22,060
You know, it's stuff you probably wouldn't hear of if you didn't think to look.

633
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:26,720
It's definitely not the mainstream, I mean it's synth pop.

634
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:33,340
And what's interesting though is because, I don't know how old you guys are, but I don't

635
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:35,680
know if you remember the 80s at all.

636
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:36,680
A little bit.

637
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:37,680
Iguan girls lighten up over there.

638
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:38,680
It was a blur, man.

639
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:40,680
If it makes you feel better, I'm 27.

640
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:44,240
I was just passing out of the uterus then.

641
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:51,600
No, no, I may sound young, but I'm actually 26, so I'm not that young, man, okay, alright,

642
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:52,600
cool.

643
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:55,680
We remember the 80s, it's all good.

644
00:47:55,680 --> 00:48:00,380
But I used to DJ in the 80s, and so a lot of the music that comes off of a different

645
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:04,460
drum label is kind of reminiscent of that era.

646
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:10,040
That's what I'm loving too, like the Naropa song, I remember when I heard that the first

647
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:11,040
time I was like-

648
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,040
It's Depeche Mode!

649
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:17,580
Depeche Mode meets Erasure meets, like, cool. I just loved it, so definitely a lot of 80s

650
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:21,420
remnants and stuff in there. Very cool. I just wanted to pass this along to you now.

651
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:25,380
We actually have somebody in our chat room right now over at Orangelaunchradio.com, click

652
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:31,980
on chat, somebody that works for Konami. And he actually says that their product manager,

653
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:37,260
Jason Enos, said that Akira has heard the remix you did, and he likes it a lot. And

654
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:39,940
I'm supposed to let you know. I'm supposed to let you know.

655
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:41,940
Right on.

656
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:45,940
Wow, I'm glad that the information could come to us that fast. God bless the internet.

657
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:51,940
Look at that. A first ever in the life of Midihead. He hears from the man himself.

658
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:53,940
Well, I'm not really the man. I'm just coming through.

659
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:56,940
Live on Orange Lounge Radio.

660
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:58,940
That was my best Roger radio voice, by the way.

661
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:00,940
Welcome to the Morning Drive.

662
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:08,940
Welcome to the Morning Drive.

663
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:23,900
I used to intern at a Top 40 radio station back when I was 14 years old, when I started

664
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:26,900
to get into radio.

665
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:32,300
I sat down in the general manager's office at the radio station about the time I was

666
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:34,860
16 years old and he said,

667
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:45,240
Mike, I'm sorry to tell you this, but I don't think you have the voice for radio, so I passed

668
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:46,240
up the career, guys.

669
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:52,240
I know it sounds like I should have stuck with it, but uh...

670
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:58,600
Yeah, I have to admit I've hit a few roadblocks on my way up the radio ladder, so that's why

671
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,160
I'm stuck here doing internet radio.

672
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:04,760
But see, the way I figure is that together, when we work together like this, when the

673
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:08,480
indie labels come together with the indie radio stations, we're going to take over the

674
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:09,480
world!

675
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:10,480
Yeah, man!

676
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,480
Define and conquer!

677
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:16,160
Power to the people!

678
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,160
Right on.

679
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:21,600
Let's see, what other kind of future projects are you working on right now?

680
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:25,120
I know you've done work for TV and movies, is there anything else upcoming that we can

681
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:26,120
look forward to?

682
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:35,200
Yeah, you know, I'm going to be in several B-movies and since I'm in the Los Angeles

683
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:38,080
area there will be some of the adult film.

684
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:41,320
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

685
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:44,320
Okay, I hope everybody knows I'm just kidding.

686
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:45,320
You were?

687
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:46,320
Yeah, yeah, okay.

688
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:47,320
Wait, no, I'm kidding.

689
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:49,680
I was looking forward to some Bow Chickabow Wow.

690
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,880
Bow Chickabow Wow.

691
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:58,200
But no, I'm actually working on a new album and the title of the album is called Weapons

692
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:02,400
of Mass Seduction.

693
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:05,960
That sounds porno right there.

694
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:12,200
I was afraid of that originally when I thought of the title, but because of my frustration

695
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:20,520
with the media and pretty much just turning on the local television stations here in California,

696
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:27,160
I don't know, I don't know, I don't want to get into politics, but I'm more of a conservative

697
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:30,320
kind of guy than, I would say, a liberal.

698
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:39,240
And you know, it just frustrates me, the kind of crap we get fed on the TV.

699
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:45,960
So that's kind of where the title came from, was the weapons of mass seduction being the

700
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:47,960
media.

701
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:51,520
here in Sacramento remember we're right in the middle of Arnold country so we

702
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:54,940
see lots and lots of stuff on the news all the time is this you know all these

703
00:51:54,940 --> 00:52:01,080
interesting stuff so yeah um let's see oh for other fans for the fans of your

704
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:05,160
in my eyes remix that you did where can they check out more your music the if

705
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:08,080
they you know like that remix and thinking I want to check out some more

706
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:12,400
MIDI head stuff we're gonna go to check some stuff out well I think you said it

707
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:18,400
Everybody with me? Ready? www.MIDIhead.com.

708
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:23,400
Words for me. Words for me. You have other albums out there right now, too, though, right?

709
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:31,400
Yeah, I have the first album I released called Power Undiminished.

710
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:42,840
won the American Synthpop Award in 2001 here in Hollywood, California for Best Album.

711
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:54,200
Also, more recently than that, Dividing Asunder.

712
00:52:54,200 --> 00:53:01,380
I'm actually going to be doing my own radio broadcast here sometime in the month of December

713
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:09,340
before OtakuCon where there will be a world premiere listening of my latest track which

714
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:16,300
has not been released yet and that one is titled Away From Here.

715
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:22,240
So I guess just check the website for that information and I'll keep you posted.

716
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:26,120
So you're trying to break into the internet radio world as well, huh?

717
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:29,960
Well no, I think it's fun.

718
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:33,040
What you guys are doing, it sounds like you guys are having a good time.

719
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:40,200
And I've always wanted to do my own show since I was a small kid, and internet has allowed

720
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:41,680
us to do that.

721
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:42,680
Absolutely.

722
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:46,640
And I'm just going to try it out and see how I like it.

723
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,600
And maybe I'll do once a month broadcasts or something.

724
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:51,640
Be careful, it's really addicting.

725
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:52,640
Because we...

726
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,120
Iguana Girl, how long have we been doing this?

727
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:56,920
You've been doing it for a couple of years at least?

728
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,920
Well, yeah, probably like four or five now.

729
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:03,520
I've been involved in various shows for probably about five or six years, so it's pretty addicting.

730
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:06,920
You guys are doing Live 365, right?

731
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:11,600
Yeah, this current program we're doing is through Live 365, Orange Lawns Radio, and

732
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:13,600
they're great to us, too.

733
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:17,720
So they've got a lot of great services for anybody that's looking into it.

734
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:22,280
Even when they forgot to mention our name at the Best of Live 365 Awards, in which we

735
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:28,240
were nominated in a category and they completely forgot us, we forgave them for it.

736
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:31,480
Do we have the clip?

737
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:32,480
I wish we had the clip.

738
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:35,560
I would love for Mitty Head to hear the clip because it's hilarious and I don't think our

739
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:37,520
listeners have heard the clip in a long time either.

740
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,240
I'll have to dig that up.

741
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:44,800
Wait, did they actually, you recorded the clip of them apologizing?

742
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:49,000
The whole thing was broadcasted live and one of our listeners recorded it and sent the

743
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:54,080
whole thing to us because it's hilarious because you can hear us in the background going, hey!

744
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:56,040
They forgot our name.

745
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:58,880
It's pretty funny.

746
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:03,280
Anyway, I want to go ahead and allow our listeners a chance to ask some questions.

747
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:07,860
OrangeLoungeRadio.com, click on chat and you can submit some questions live to us via our

748
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:09,160
chat room.

749
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:12,080
For instance, we have Legend of Zaku is in our chat room.

750
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:13,080
He has a question for you here.

751
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:17,360
He wants to know, how did you approach doing the remixing itself?

752
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:22,800
In other words, what kind of inspired you to go about making the remix that you did?

753
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:32,840
I think that I wanted to come from a cinematic sort of feel.

754
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:40,400
If you listen to the beginning of the track, it kind of starts out with some heavy thunderous

755
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:41,960
noises and stuff like that.

756
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:49,120
So I kind of wanted it to be a very intense track because I felt the vocal was conveying

757
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:53,520
a sort of intensity there and a seriousness.

758
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:56,520
Does that answer the question?

759
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:57,520
I think so.

760
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,520
I think so.

761
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:03,080
They're responding to it in chat that they're kind of giving it that epic sound a little

762
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:04,080
bit.

763
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:08,720
Yeah, but that's kind of how my sound is, hence the name Monolithic.

764
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:11,300
Everything I do has an epic kind of sound to it.

765
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:14,800
Now that was something that we didn't quite get into a little bit there before, but you

766
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,660
actually work under several different names.

767
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:18,900
Not just Midihead, but Monolithic as well.

768
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:19,900
That's right.

769
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:23,540
So are there any other pseudonyms that you use as well for music?

770
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:26,860
Well there is the Sexy Skinny Guy.

771
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:30,540
Hey, wait a minute, I thought that was my name.

772
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:36,040
I had the trademark on that.

773
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:37,040
Let's see.

774
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:48,040
Trent Reznor? You know him? No, I'm sorry, I wouldn't want to own up to that guy. He's

775
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:52,280
got great talent and everything. That's a different direction.

776
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:56,380
Little different direction. You know what's interesting is there's actually

777
00:56:56,380 --> 00:57:01,000
one guy that does a lot of music for DDR and Naoki, I don't know if you've heard of him

778
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:05,360
or not, he's got a lot of tracks. But that guy probably has 20 to 30 different

779
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:10,620
pseudonyms he's done music under? It's crazy. You know what, that's the way you do it. I

780
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:17,340
don't know how many of the pseudonyms you know that Prince has, but Prince has tons

781
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:23,580
and tons of pseudonyms. He's produced so many albums under so many different names. I think

782
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:28,940
that's the way to go. I probably will in the future release another album off of a different

783
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:36,980
I think what happens is if one pseudonym dies or it's not successful or not working out,

784
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:40,820
you can always do something else under a totally different name and people don't know it's

785
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:41,820
you.

786
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:42,820
You just reinvent yourself.

787
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:46,780
You reinvent yourself or you do other music styles or whatever else you need to do, but

788
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:49,420
I think if you're an artist, that's a smart thing to do.

789
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:53,380
Maybe that's what we need to do here at Orange Toms Radio to get noticed because it's not

790
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:54,380
working.

791
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:55,380
No, I'm kidding.

792
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:58,300
We need to call it Sexy Action Radio.

793
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:06,260
skinny sexy guy radio, skinny sexy guy radio, there you go, that plays games occasionally.

794
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:09,660
We have a comment from Seagurd in our chat room, he's the guy that actually works at

795
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:12,820
Konami and what Seagurd did at Konami is he was one of the testers.

796
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:16,660
Wait a minute, before you get going here, is this chat room just full of folks from

797
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:17,660
Konami here?

798
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:23,480
No, just the one, otherwise it's just fanboys and girls, just like the rest of us that just

799
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:28,280
love the games, but Seagurd's one of those cases where he was someone that was a fan

800
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:32,280
and then actually kind of got in the door and got to work on one of the games.

801
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:33,280
That's cool.

802
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:36,280
Yeah, he's a great guy. He's been on the show before, we like having him on.

803
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:38,280
In fact, we might have him on later tonight.

804
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:42,280
But he worked on the steps, actually, part of the steps for DDR,

805
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:46,280
and he wanted you to know that the step creation team thought that your song

806
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:49,280
was easily one of the top songs that they had to work with.

807
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:51,280
So he just wanted to pass that along.

808
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,280
Ah, that's great. Tell them thank you.

809
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,280
I think he's listening, so hopefully you heard that.

810
00:58:55,280 --> 00:59:06,280
Oh, thank you. You're a sweet man. I love you. And no, I'm not gay. I mean that plutonically.

811
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:14,280
What other artists from the different drum label have you collaborated with in the past?

812
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:20,280
I've actually collaborated with a couple of them. I want to do more collaboration. I'll

813
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:25,840
I'll just tell you that the artists I've done work with are neuro-active.

814
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:34,920
I did a song with, his name is Jarco, and obviously he's not American.

815
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:41,200
I did a song called, Fiber Optic Rhythm, and he sent me the music over the internet and

816
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:46,280
I wrote the song, sent it back to him, he put it on the album.

817
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:56,280
I haven't really done much collaboration.

818
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:58,400
There's collaboration to be had, I know that.

819
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:07,520
I've been speaking with Jeff Pinckney of The Nine, one of my other favorite ADD label artists.

820
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:15,400
He's actually working with me right now doing some music for my publisher.

821
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:19,160
he and I will be collaborating on some stuff in the future.

822
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:20,400
All right, cool.

823
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,640
Let's do one more question from our chat here.

824
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:26,400
We have MJB wants to know, are there any other songs

825
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:29,200
in Bamani, which is what we call the music games that Konami

826
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:32,820
puts out, including DDR and BBN2DX, et cetera.

827
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:35,400
Are there any other songs you've considered remixing

828
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:36,880
in the series?

829
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:39,360
Has doing this remix that you've already done

830
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:42,480
kind of made you want to remix some other songs there

831
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:43,760
in Bamani?

832
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:49,920
Well, you know, asking me if I want to remix something is like asking me if I want to wake

833
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:54,320
up in the morning and have breakfast.

834
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:57,000
It's just a matter of choices.

835
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:06,080
I've got a whole cabinet full of cereal, do I pick the corn checks or the wheat checks?

836
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:13,240
I'm not project-less, so I have my plate fairly full all the time with music projects.

837
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:19,240
Doing music for television libraries keeps me fairly busy, and of course I have my day job.

838
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:23,240
I don't really go out and seek after remix work.

839
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:29,240
Remix work, if somebody needs something done, they'll usually ask me now.

840
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:30,240
I used to have to seek it out.

841
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:34,240
That's when you know you've made it big time, when they come find you.

842
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:40,240
When you've made it big time, you've bought your home in Hollywood Hills.

843
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:48,240
Right. Well, I was going to do it for the questions from our chat, but actually we wanted to kind of wrap up and go to a song.

844
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:52,240
We're actually going to play something. I wasn't unfortunately, Midyhead, able to get that song that you sent me over email.

845
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:58,240
For some reason, my email is not coming up with a new message. So, I thought maybe we could play a track from Diving Asunder.

846
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:02,240
I'm sorry, Dividing Asunder, actually. I thought maybe we could do a song from there.

847
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:08,240
And, Midyhead, you're actually going to give some of our listeners some free stuff tonight, as I understand it?

848
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:15,240
Yeah, actually we've got a couple of really great prizes to give away.

849
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:22,240
We've got a deep-sea fishing in the Salt Lake, the Great Salt Lake.

850
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:29,240
We have some deep-sea carp fishing trips to give away.

851
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:31,240
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

852
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:34,240
I don't think that was in the email I saw.

853
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:39,240
Are you sure that wasn't like the Ryan Seacrest show or something?

854
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:44,240
Ice fishing in Alaska.

855
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:51,240
Actually, we're going to give away a couple of CD's from Dividing Asunder.

856
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:54,240
A couple of monolithic CD's Dividing Asunder.

857
01:02:54,240 --> 01:03:13,240
And if you want, I'll also pick a couple of listeners to get some free downloads because I also host, you can purchase MP3s off of Midihead.com as well of my previous albums if you want to get them in electronic format.

858
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:15,240
And Loki says he's already bought all three.

859
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:16,240
Yep.

860
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:17,240
All three albums.

861
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:21,240
Dude, I appreciate you man, thank you.

862
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:22,240
No problem.

872
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:56,040
Midi Head, thank you so much for being here on the show tonight.

873
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:57,040
We appreciate it.

874
01:03:57,040 --> 01:03:58,040
Yeah, you're welcome, guys.

875
01:03:58,040 --> 01:03:59,040
It was a pleasure.

876
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:00,560
Did anybody else hear in the room?

877
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:02,080
It's been kind of quiet here in the room.

878
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:03,520
I think we've just all been kind of...

879
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:04,520
We've been absorbing.

880
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:05,520
Yeah, Midi Head's so entertaining.

881
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:06,520
We're like sponges.

882
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:07,520
Absolutely.

883
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:08,520
I hear crickets.

884
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:10,520
What's going on over there?

885
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:11,520
Oh, no.

886
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:14,240
We're just...we're just...we're mesmerized by your every word.

887
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:15,240
Fanboys.

888
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:17,960
Oh, that was a safe answer.

889
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:21,800
Alright, well we do appreciate you being here, wish you the best of luck, and I hope we get

890
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:23,800
to talk to you again in the future, alright?

891
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:24,800
I'm sure you will.

892
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:26,440
Alright, well you take care of yourself, but...

893
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:32,320
Have a good night, my love goes out to everyone listening, and have a happy holiday everyone.

894
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:33,320
You too.

895
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:34,320
Thanks.

896
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:36,320
Alright, take care, big head, thank you.

897
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:40,000
Alright, that was good, what a nice guy.

898
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:45,720
I would like to say out there to our listeners, and I'm quoting, he uses acid.

899
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:50,720
I'm fucking going on every Bimani board and saying he fucking uses acid, fuck you guys,

900
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:53,200
I'm entering the damn contest with acid.

901
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:56,720
That's what I was trying to get at when I cut him off.

902
01:04:56,720 --> 01:05:01,360
How rude of me to cut the guy off while I'm interviewing him to make that very point,

903
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:08,400
Loki, that the professionals are using acid, so shut up and let Loki use acid in the contest,

904
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:09,400
people.

905
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:13,720
All you have to do is just make a nice little sound clip out of it, post it on the board

We're going to have to invite him out for drinks at E3.

914
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:48,200
Seriously.

915
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:49,200
Seriously.

I hope we can make it.

917
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:51,200
All right.

918
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:52,200
Anyway, let's check out.

919
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:55,000
Let's stop gushing for a minute here, and let's hear some music.

920
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,680
We're going to hear a track from the CD we're giving away tonight, Dividing Asunder.

921
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:03,200
This song is called Lulling Us to Sleep, which this show sometimes does to people, but not

922
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:04,200
tonight.

923
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:05,200
Not tonight.

924
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:08,480
So we're going to hear this track, and we will be right back with more Orange Lounge

925
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:15,480
radio.

926
01:06:38,480 --> 01:07:06,480
We are walking in our sleep, though our eyes are open, our slumber is so deep.

927
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:11,480
We, it's our souls but gentle things

928
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:15,480
A hypnotist has spoken

929
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:18,480
A lullaby it sings

930
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:25,480
Lost in our dreams of green and gold

931
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:29,480
In the visions of our high years

932
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:32,480
In the throne of wealth so bold

933
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:31,360
Okay, sorry guys, we're having some technical difficulties there, I know bad me, that song

934
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:33,360
The song is rockin' too. Sorry guys.

935
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:35,360
Play it again.

936
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:38,360
Internet radio is broke left and right. What can I say?

937
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:40,360
Hold on. Let's try this again.

938
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:43,360
No, that was my question also. Is Meaty Head singing this?

939
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:46,360
I think so. I'm not sure. Sorry guys.

940
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:49,360
And all familiar too

941
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:53,360
That if the sun won't shine for us

942
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:56,360
You're praying to the moon

943
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:01,360
She's alive

944
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:05,360
Without love

945
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:08,360
We search to find her

946
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:11,360
In one mop and rust

947
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:20,360
The corrupt, deep in the arms Of the thought that mistakes me

948
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:24,360
Something is the case

949
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:31,360
Calling us to sleep like ladies

950
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:47,360
Wake from a sleep that finds us down

951
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:54,360
Look down to the higher, poorer of the crown

952
01:09:56,360 --> 01:10:01,360
See, there's a wellness in the heart

953
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:05,360
A light that shines through darkness

954
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:08,360
And breaks the chains apart

955
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:18,360
What is a lie without love?

956
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:23,360
Such a fine day in much more than rust

957
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:28,360
Not to love deep in the arms

958
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:32,360
But what's it to say?

959
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:18,720
Hi-ho, Kermit the Fog here informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is

960
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:22,720
brought to you by the letter D, the letter A, and the number 59.

961
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:28,280
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

962

Don't cheat.

978
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Cheaters don't prosper.

01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,560
You people should know this by now.

980
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:19,480
If you cheat, you don't win.

981
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:20,480
Period.

982
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:21,480
Exactly.

983
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:22,480
Exactly.

984
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:25,080
Speaking of winning.

985
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:43,500
We have another giveaway that's still going on.

1013
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:29,640
we begin where do we go I want to talk the news what's going on in the news

1014
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:32,560
what's going on the sim scene Loki I know there's stuff going on in the sim

1015
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:36,880
world right now in the worlds of DDR simulation he's thinking is there

1016
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:44,280
anything going on this week not really no I'm not at all actually and how the

1017
01:15:44,280 --> 01:16:08,280
No, no, no, no, nothing. Well, eh, I guess one little thing to mention, um, BomaniStyle posted, if you guys are Guitar Freaks or Mania fans, they have the sim files for, um, Guitar Freaks, I think, one through ten, and you can get those in their media shop there, and it's, you know, it's got all your, uh, GDA files for, um, uh, DTX Mania, which is, you know, a sim, and, um, those type of things.

1018
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:14,640
So if you want more information, first off, download The Sims in the media shop on BOMAiStyle

1019
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:22,160
and check out their session forms, or session simulation forms on BOMAiStyle as well for

1020
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:26,320
all your information on how to actually use those sim files and play around with them.

1021
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:28,320
They're a lot of fun.

1022
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:30,480
Alright, very cool.

1023
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:32,780
This is a news story that's in right now.

1024
01:16:32,780 --> 01:16:36,140
It doesn't really necessarily relate to DER completely, but I thought it was interesting

1025
01:16:36,140 --> 01:16:38,780
because there's some games in here that are definitely worth mentioning.

1026
01:16:38,780 --> 01:16:42,020
Time Magazine has announced their Top 10 Video Games of the Year.

1027
01:16:42,020 --> 01:16:43,260
Are you guys ready to hear this?

1028
01:16:43,260 --> 01:16:44,260
The Top 10 Video Games?

1029
01:16:44,260 --> 01:16:45,260
Uh-oh.

1030
01:16:45,260 --> 01:16:46,260
Uh-oh.

1031
01:16:46,260 --> 01:16:52,100
And sorry guys, DDR, not on it, karaoke, not on it, Bomani, not on it.

1032
01:16:52,100 --> 01:16:54,640
Well Karaoke Revolution did win it last year if I remember right.

1033
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:59,980
So you know, I guess it's Bomani's turn to take a back seat, I was going to say a back

1034
01:16:59,980 --> 01:17:01,460
door, but that's not really it.

1035
01:17:01,460 --> 01:17:02,460
Back seat.

1036
01:17:02,460 --> 01:17:03,460
Oh no, no.

1037
01:17:03,460 --> 01:17:06,460
Let's see what the top ten games are for this year.

1038
01:17:06,460 --> 01:17:10,460
Here we go, number ten. Actually, these are in no particular order.

1039
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:12,460
They just named the top ten games here, I think.

1040
01:17:12,460 --> 01:17:17,460
Maybe it was just worded wrong here on what I'm looking at.

1041
01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:19,460
Oh, they are in order here. Let's have a look.

1042
01:17:19,460 --> 01:17:21,460
Number ten, Pirates!

1043
01:17:21,460 --> 01:17:24,460
R-M-E-D, it's Pirates!

1044
01:17:24,460 --> 01:17:27,460
It's an adventure RPG game and I believe it's on the PC.

1045
01:17:27,460 --> 01:17:28,460
Yeah, I think so.

1046
01:17:28,460 --> 01:17:30,460
Pirates.

1047
01:17:30,460 --> 01:17:32,460
Because I'd be confused with puzzle pirates.

1048
01:17:32,460 --> 01:17:34,460
Not to be confused with puzzle pirates.

1049
01:17:34,460 --> 01:17:38,460
Number nine, Fable for the Xbox, that role-playing game.

1050
01:17:38,460 --> 01:17:42,460
That's the one where you can marry a guy in it if you play the cards right.

1051
01:17:42,460 --> 01:17:44,460
Pretty awesome.

1052
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:50,460
Number eight, Burnout 3 Take Down, another racing and crashing game.

1053
01:17:50,460 --> 01:17:52,460
Look, he's giving the thumbs up to that. Any particular reason?

1054
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:56,460
Well, the first one was awesome and this one looked really good, but I just have no interest in buying games.

1055
01:17:56,460 --> 01:18:02,980
games. Number seven, and I'm actually surprised it's kind of low because everybody in the

1056
01:18:02,980 --> 01:18:06,700
gaming community has a huge boner about Halo 2 is number seven.

1057
01:18:06,700 --> 01:18:10,100
Wow, that low, huh? Yeah, I'm kind of surprised. So let's see

1058
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:16,620
what seven games, or six games are that beat Halo 2. Number six, Battlefield Vietnam. Yes,

1059
01:18:16,620 --> 01:18:19,340
another shooting war game. I remember that one at E3.

1060
01:18:19,340 --> 01:18:25,020
For your Xbox, yep. Yeah. Number five, and I'm surprised this one's

1061
01:18:25,020 --> 01:18:32,200
kind of low too. Grand Theft Auto San Andreas. I think we all know that game. If you haven't

1062
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:35,860
heard about Grand Theft Auto, it's time to come out of your hole. Seriously? You get

1063
01:18:35,860 --> 01:18:42,100
to take a construction foreman, knock him over inside a porta potty, then bury him alive

1064
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:48,740
inside cement. That's awesome. Wow. But not awesome enough to be under five. Just because

1065
01:18:48,740 --> 01:18:55,740
he was making fun of your sister. So what rolled over Grand Theft Auto to land in fourth

1066
01:18:55,840 --> 01:19:02,680
place? Katamari Damacy. Yay! Number four game. I know there's a lot of folks. Best underground

1067
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:09,680
hit ever. Honestly, it's the sleeper hit probably so far this decade. Seriously, it's the biggest

1068
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:15,960
sleeper hit I've ever seen. Number three, a little game you might have heard of, Half-Life

1069
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:22,960
Half-Life 2

1070
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:49,960
What do you mean you don't play strategy games? This is the best strategy game ever, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah.

1071
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:51,960
I'm so glad I don't have headphones right now.

1072
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:53,960
That sounds so lame.

1073
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:54,960
Rome Total War.

1074
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:55,960
Hey!

1075
01:19:55,960 --> 01:20:06,960
Wait a second, wasn't that that stupid game that Capcom was pushing or something that was like, um, like some sort of, like, almost like Metal Gear Solid in Greek Roman times, you know?

1076
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:14,960
Was that, was that the game? Because that one looked really lame, and every time I saw it on their big screen, I'd laugh at it.

1077
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:17,960
Alright, you want to know what the number one game of the year is according to time?

1078
01:20:17,960 --> 01:20:18,960
Wait, wait.

1079
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:19,960
I have to interrupt you real quick.

1080
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:20,960
Okay.

1081
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:21,960
Midi Head has joined us in our chat room.

1082
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:22,960
Really?

1083
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:23,960
Yes.

1084
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:24,960
Hey.

1085
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:25,960
Wow.

1086
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:30,640
Well, welcome, Midi Head, joining in the chat there, so go give him the same praise you

1087
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:34,440
were giving earlier while that song was playing, honestly, and play his ego a little more,

1088
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:35,440
please.

1089
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:36,440
I'm sure.

1090
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:40,120
Yeah, we'll send you a check for that, or, well, I mean, you can send us a check for

1091
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:43,520
that later, no.

1092
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:44,520
Number one.

1093
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:47,880
number one game of the year according to time magazine and I think Loki could

1094
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:51,240
possibly agree with this one I'm not sure based on the murder simulation he

1095
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:56,600
has created in number one the Sims 2 actually give the number one rating to

1096
01:20:56,600 --> 01:21:00,680
because at e3 that just was phenomenal and what is coming out for the sims 2

1097
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:08,120
but not only the first expansion pack where the sims go to college did you not

1098
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:18,120
Yep, they go to college, they join in on SPRING BREAK frat parties, it is Sims 2 going to school.

1099
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:22,120
Do we get to get Sims drunk now?

1100
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:27,120
How many expansion packs are they going to make for this Sims game, honestly? How many did they do for-

1101
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:33,120
I'm waiting for the adult Ed Powers version, the hardcore.

1102
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:40,120
No, that'd be Playboy, the mansion game, you know, where you manage the Playboy mansion

1103
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:46,320
and just like watch chicks running around naked that are like stupid looking. That's

1104
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:53,320
about as fun as Leisure Suit Larry, the new one, which I beat, and I gotta say, it was

1105
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:55,040
kinda lame.

1106
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:58,680
Okay, was it at least enjoyable?

1107
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:03,680
It was enjoyable after I took the censorship off.

1108
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:08,680
You have to love any game though that allows you to be a sperm trying to make it through.

1109
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:13,680
And avoiding different blocks to try to make it through the egg.

1110
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:18,680
That was pretty funny.

1111
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:23,680
Any overlooked games you guys think for the top ten of the year?

1112
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:25,680
Besides Ultra Mix 2.

1113
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:26,680
Oh, look.

1114
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:32,680
God, you know, it's good that I've already made it because otherwise I would have been like WAH!

1115
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:36,680
Yeah, Metal Gear Solid 3.

1116
01:22:36,680 --> 01:22:39,680
I'm actually a little bit surprised.

1117
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:46,680
I'm wondering if it was because the release date was so late that something such as Smackdown vs. Raw wouldn't have made it.

1118
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:50,680
Just because, I mean, it's amazing. It is utterly amazing.

1119
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:54,680
F that, rumble roses, where's my rumble roses?

1120
01:22:54,680 --> 01:23:01,680
Yeah, but you have to admit that the play through mode, the story mode, oh my god, that's horrible.

1121
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:06,680
Even Seagert agrees with me in chat there, rumble roses was far overlooked for the top three.

1122
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:10,680
It was, but that, you know, the story mode is just...

1123
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:13,680
Although the game is getting horrible reviews, that's right.

1124
01:23:13,680 --> 01:23:15,680
Oh come on!

1125
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:21,680
Sure, they give, you know, DOA beach volleyball good reviews, but no, this one actually has gameplay.

1126
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:30,680
Oh, it's interrupting my watching them walk around. Damn it. I actually have to play on this one? That sucks.

1127
01:23:30,680 --> 01:23:32,680
It's interrupting the jiggle scenes, damn it.

1128
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:38,680
They should have DOA versus Rumble Roses and just like one all naked fest mud-wrestling game.

1129
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:39,680
There you go.

1130
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:40,680
There you go.

1131
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:41,680
I totally agree.

1132
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:44,680
Not enough nakedness in games, I guess.

1133
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:48,680
Where was the guy game?

1134
01:23:48,680 --> 01:23:52,680
I have never played the guy game. I've only heard about this game. Have you played the guy game?

1135
01:23:52,680 --> 01:23:56,680
Yes, I have to admit, I did rent it. What the hell is up with the guy game? Tell me about the guy game.

1136
01:23:56,680 --> 01:24:00,680
Okay, the guy game was apparently filmed spring break last year

1137
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:04,680
at some place in Texas where they were just basically asking

1138
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:08,680
women trivia questions. And these women are dumb as rocks.

1139
01:24:08,680 --> 01:24:12,680
Let's be honest here. And the first part of the game is

1140
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:16,540
to see, you know, which one of the four players will get it right, and then

1141
01:24:16,540 --> 01:24:20,560
the second part is to figure out if the girl's gonna get it right,

1142
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:24,000
and if you figure that she's gonna get it, you know, right or wrong.

1143
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:27,760
The girl's never gonna get it right! I'm just kidding, I'm kidding. No, no, there's a few that actually do, and it's kind of scary.

1144
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:31,400
I'm kidding, I'm kidding. It's kind of scary. Isn't that stolen from Howard Stern?

1145
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:35,880
You saw, like, some other talk show, because I know this has been stolen, like, on numerous talk shows.

1146
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:40,280
Oh, you know, yeah, it obviously has, but there's this little meter

1147
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:44,280
that goes up, and at first it starts off, you know, if they get it wrong, they have to flash their tits.

1148
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:53,280
And so it first starts off with them flashing, and it has the guy game logo across their chest.

1149
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:59,280
You get the level up a little bit higher, and all of a sudden the logo disappears, but their boobies are pixelated.

1150
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:05,280
So it's kind of fuzzy, and then you get to the last level, where it's totally uncensored.

1151
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:17,280
And he could replay the level, and see all these girls topless, and it's just kind of head-scratching, mind-boggling, just what the hell are they thinking?

1152
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:19,280
Like BMX XXX?

1153
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:24,280
You know, I have that game, and I can't play it because it gives me motion sickness.

1154
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:30,280
I love that game. And the movies are awesome, and the final movies kick ass.

1155
01:25:30,280 --> 01:25:34,280
Asian schoolgirl stripping.

1156
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:39,280
I'm surprised that this game isn't still number one today, seriously.

1157
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:41,280
But no, the guy game, oh my goodness.

1158
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:46,280
Yes, I'm shocked the guy game is not the number one game of the year. So shocked.

1159
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:51,280
Anyway, I think now's a good time to call it a break.

1160
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:56,280
Iguana Girl, I noticed you're purposefully quiet over there during discussions of the guy game.

1161
01:25:56,280 --> 01:25:58,280
I was just telling Mitty he had goodbye.

1162
01:25:58,280 --> 01:25:59,280
Oh, he left? He took off?

1163
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:00,280
He left.

1164
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:01,280
Did our chat room scare him off?

1165
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:04,600
I was being all nice to your guests and everything.

1166
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:08,200
All I know is I looked in the chat room and somebody said that they were jizzing their

1167
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:12,000
pants when they listened to the Midihead song, and I'm just like, I better not read anymore.

1168
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,880
Honestly, I better not read anymore.

1169
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:16,880
No, I love our listeners.

1170
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:17,880
They're great.

1171
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:23,720
He did mention that if you go to his site, I already scrolled up on my screen, but...

1172
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:24,720
Midihead.com is the site.

1173
01:26:24,720 --> 01:26:25,720
Yeah.

1174
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:30,360
If you go to midihead.com and there's, I guess, the submit form that you can, he was going

1175
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:35,040
to give away some of those free downloads, and that's how you're going to do it.

1176
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:39,200
Okay, okay, so cool. You might be able to still see it on your screen. Head over there,

1177
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:42,920
do it. Alright, sounds good. We're going to take a break, when we come back from the break

1178
01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:47,480
we'll do a little more chatting. I want to talk about Tycho, because they brought Tycho.

1179
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:51,240
I don't know if we're going to get a chance to play Tycho right now, but I want to get

1180
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:56,400
your thoughts on Tycho, certainly. We're not doing a cage match tonight, you guys. We can't

1181
01:26:56,400 --> 01:27:01,240
to do a cage match tonight. We've got something else in store. And I'm going to tell you guys

1182
01:27:01,240 --> 01:27:08,240
this much. It is not a cage match. It is not a reverse cage match. And Loki is crying.

1183
01:27:09,380 --> 01:27:16,380
Find out when we come back. 2DX11 music coming your way. We'll be back. Or 2DX Red I should

1184
01:27:16,380 --> 01:27:23,380
I should say. Sorry, fanboys.

1185
01:28:16,380 --> 01:28:20,240
...

1186
01:28:20,240 --> 01:28:24,240
...

1187
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:28,240
...

1188
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:32,240
...

1189
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:36,240
...

1190
01:28:36,240 --> 01:28:40,240
...

1191
01:28:40,240 --> 01:28:44,240
...

1192
01:31:14,240 --> 01:31:14,740
Hey!

1193
01:32:44,740 --> 01:32:53,240
Oh, you said, oh, oh, we were born again

1194
01:32:53,240 --> 01:32:58,240
We are here, yes, I will be

1195
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:07,240
We were born again, oh, oh, we were born again

1196
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:17,240
um

1197
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:32,420
h Building

1198
01:33:32,420 --> 01:33:42,420
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1199
01:33:42,420 --> 01:33:50,420
By the way, that video is great.

1200
01:33:50,420 --> 01:33:52,420
I finally watched it.

1201
01:33:52,420 --> 01:33:58,420
Anyway, Midyhead actually sent me an email during the break there and he wants you guys to know that yes, that was him singing in that song.

1202
01:33:58,420 --> 01:34:02,420
For those of you guys that want to know if that was his voice, yes, that was his name.

1203
01:34:02,420 --> 01:34:06,420
And he's sending me a new song of his to play.

1204
01:34:06,420 --> 01:34:10,420
Very cool. And we'll be playing that at the end of the show. Looking forward to that.

1205
01:34:10,420 --> 01:34:14,420
Don't forget guys, free stuff at Orangelaundry.com. And if you missed the

1206
01:34:14,420 --> 01:34:18,420
interview tonight or any part of it, don't worry, you get a second chance.

1207
01:34:18,420 --> 01:34:22,420
You get second helpings thanks to DER Freak Radio who's going to be

1208
01:34:22,420 --> 01:34:26,420
rebroadcasting it on December 10th. December 10th, yeah. 6 o'clock. As they do

1209
01:34:26,420 --> 01:34:31,820
our little show over there. Orange Lounge Radio Rewind. Yep so very cool and of

1210
01:34:31,820 --> 01:34:35,380
course some of you guys may be thinking well didn't you guys used to do the

1211
01:34:35,380 --> 01:34:39,460
rewinds on your own damn station Sky? Yeah actually that's true but now it is

1212
01:34:39,460 --> 01:34:44,120
the oldie and moldy Wednesday flashback where we are 100 episodes behind right

1213
01:34:44,120 --> 01:34:47,020
now so you can hear what the show sounded like two years ago it's pretty

1214
01:34:47,020 --> 01:34:51,440
nuts. I kind of looked at the chat and some of the response to last week's

1215
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:55,140
episode and I think I think Misty or somebody had said it's a good thing I

1216
01:34:55,140 --> 01:35:00,100
wasn't there, because I would have ripped him a new asshole. So here are what offensive

1217
01:35:00,100 --> 01:35:04,280
things you missed out on back on episodes 20 and 21 and all that stuff we're playing

1218
01:35:04,280 --> 01:35:12,280
way back when, so check it out. Alright, so we're going to get to our, not a cage match,

1219
01:35:12,280 --> 01:35:16,160
but something a little different in a little bit, but I wanted to talk first about Taiko

1220
01:35:16,160 --> 01:35:20,840
Drum Master. It's a game that kind of came out there under our noses. I know we got to

1221
01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:24,240
it out of E3 and we told you guys a little bit about it.

1222
01:35:24,240 --> 01:35:28,980
Huge game in Japan called Taiko no Tatujin in Japan, basically for those who don't know

1223
01:35:28,980 --> 01:35:29,980
what it's about.

1224
01:35:29,980 --> 01:35:30,980
It's about taiko drumming.

1225
01:35:30,980 --> 01:35:34,120
You have these big things that look like breadsticks and you beat the drum.

1226
01:35:34,120 --> 01:35:36,720
You beat it in the center and you beat it in the side.

1227
01:35:36,720 --> 01:35:39,600
So popular in Japan, it was the number one selling game in Japan for a while that they

1228
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:43,520
decided to bring it over to the US, call it Taiko Drum Master.

1229
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:46,000
And Aguana Grow, you guys actually picked up a copy of it, right?

1230
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:51,520
We purchased a copy over at our local Fry's Electronics for $60.

1231
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:53,960
That includes the game and the drum.

1232
01:35:53,960 --> 01:35:56,080
And we're absolutely loving it.

1233
01:35:56,080 --> 01:35:57,200
Some assembly required.

1234
01:35:57,200 --> 01:35:58,400
Yeah, some assembly required.

1235
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:00,840
They have little things to put on the bottom

1236
01:36:00,840 --> 01:36:02,560
so that you can kind of lift up the drum.

1237
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:03,560
Oh, that's not that bad.

1238
01:36:03,560 --> 01:36:04,640
Yeah.

1239
01:36:04,640 --> 01:36:07,280
Nothing that a two-year-old can't figure out.

1240
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:11,400
Kind of slot A into slot B type of thing.

1241
01:36:11,400 --> 01:36:14,760
And the music selection is excellent.

1242
01:36:14,760 --> 01:36:22,600
For those who are Katamari fans, there is one song that is, yeah, Katamari on the Rocks,

1243
01:36:22,600 --> 01:36:23,600
that is...

1244
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:30,520
Oh, God, who doesn't know that song that's playing that game?

1245
01:36:30,520 --> 01:36:32,440
And that's a lot of fun.

1246
01:36:32,440 --> 01:36:40,560
And the ironic thing is that there's actually several songs that were the more traditional,

1247
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:47,920
the classical songs like, you know, Hungarian Dance and stuff like that.

1248
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:48,920
Yeah.

1249
01:36:48,920 --> 01:36:50,920
Symphony No. 5, Hungarian Dance.

1250
01:36:50,920 --> 01:36:55,400
By the way, I just want to talk about how scary it was that we all burst into song on

1251
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:56,400
the Katamari Damacy record.

1252
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:57,400
A little bit scary there.

1253
01:36:57,400 --> 01:37:03,880
Well, I mean, I think that song is just so great because, I mean, just for the da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da

1254
01:37:03,880 --> 01:37:04,880
dance.

1255
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:06,160
The song is a stroke of genius.

1256
01:37:06,160 --> 01:37:10,920
but those were some songs that we actually got to play at E3

1257
01:37:10,920 --> 01:37:14,880
and that was on the... actually that was on the Taeko no Tastujin

1258
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:16,480
original setup

1259
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:19,960
but it was more like the crossover, you know, this is the E3 version of the

1260
01:37:19,960 --> 01:37:21,240
American game

1261
01:37:21,240 --> 01:37:22,200
but

1262
01:37:22,200 --> 01:37:25,120
actually the music list is pretty decent

1263
01:37:25,120 --> 01:37:28,480
we've only managed to get 31 songs, I don't know if there's further

1264
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:31,680
I think that's the max, we have unlocked the Oni mode

1265
01:37:31,680 --> 01:37:42,680
Ooh, Oni Mode. It is Oni Mode. Now, I have to ask, or else Rice Princess and Lanky Style would kill me, because this is an inside joke from outside the box, but My Sharona is in the game, correct?

1266
01:37:42,680 --> 01:37:55,680
Yes. Okay, just double-check. It is in the game. Okay. There's also, wasn't Love Shack in that? Yes. Yeah. Love Shack is also in that game. I like that song. Yeah.

1267
01:37:55,680 --> 01:38:00,680
Are you going to be my girl?

1268
01:38:00,680 --> 01:38:02,680
Yeah, that's Ross's favorite.

1269
01:38:02,680 --> 01:38:04,680
That one's a lot of fun.

1270
01:38:04,680 --> 01:38:07,680
A lot, a lot of fun.

1271
01:38:07,680 --> 01:38:10,680
There's a Queen song in there, Killer Queen.

1272
01:38:10,680 --> 01:38:17,680
All sorts of songs from Namco's own games, like the theme song from Soul Calibur, Ridge Racer.

1273
01:38:17,680 --> 01:38:22,680
I remember that the Soul Calibur song, whatever it's called, it's one of the stages.

1274
01:38:22,680 --> 01:38:26,040
Brave, brave sword, braver soul, yeah, whatever.

1275
01:38:26,040 --> 01:38:26,720
But that's cool.

1276
01:38:26,720 --> 01:38:29,480
But yeah, it's a good overall mix of music.

1277
01:38:29,480 --> 01:38:37,040
I mean, they've got a lot of American songs mixed in with the classical stuff

1278
01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:39,320
and with their own versions of stuff.

1279
01:38:39,320 --> 01:38:42,200
Like they have Tycho March and stuff like that.

1280
01:38:42,200 --> 01:38:44,400
So do you think that the kids that are upset that there's

1281
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:47,240
been no US Beatmania as of yet, do you think that this

1282
01:38:47,240 --> 01:38:49,840
might hold them over a little bit?

1283
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:56,720
Maybe it's more, yeah, it's more, you know, like the, if you were to get this and Donkey

1284
01:38:56,720 --> 01:39:00,080
Konga, then you've got like your whole drum mania thing worked out right there.

1285
01:39:00,080 --> 01:39:02,280
Okay, so it's more like a drum mania.

1286
01:39:02,280 --> 01:39:09,040
That's another ironic bit is that the classical stuff that is in Donkey Konga is, you know,

1287
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:11,500
the same stuff that's in Taiko Drum Masters.

1288
01:39:11,500 --> 01:39:18,480
So you could either choose to play the stuff on the bongos or on the taiko drums.

1289
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:19,480
Just all up to you.

1290
01:39:19,480 --> 01:39:26,480
Something for everyone, except Katamari on the rocks is not in.

1291
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:31,480
Alright guys, do we have everything set up over here that we need?

1292
01:39:31,480 --> 01:39:35,480
Is something wrong?

1293
01:39:35,480 --> 01:39:40,480
Okay, he's saying the webcam. I don't care about the webcam, we've got to get the other stuff though.

1294
01:39:40,480 --> 01:39:45,480
We are going to get to tonight's cage match boys and girls, it's time for your favorite segment of the show.

1295
01:39:45,480 --> 01:39:49,960
the show okay maybe not but it is the mandatory segment we do every week orange

1296
01:39:49,960 --> 01:39:56,480
lounge cage match where we pitch three songs against each other head-to-head

1297
01:39:56,480 --> 01:40:02,160
and we see who the winner is you guys vote and your favorite song goes into

1298
01:40:02,160 --> 01:40:07,200
rotation all week long on orange lounge radios 24 hour a day seven days a week

1299
01:40:07,200 --> 01:40:14,600
Lamani music and more program so let's see last week's winner was a little song

1300
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:18,800
here it was actually a top 40 song that's won the contest for a couple

1301
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:26,280
weeks now it's been winning for a little while now and it's called it's by Gwen

1302
01:40:26,280 --> 01:40:34,680
Stefani and I'm trying to yep what you waiting for is the song this is a clip

1303
01:40:34,680 --> 01:40:41,680
of last week's winner, Whatchu waiting for?

1304
01:40:57,200 --> 01:41:00,160
Okay, that was enough of a clip. So,

1305
01:41:00,160 --> 01:41:05,280
the question is do we do another cage match tonight without dark Sakura

1306
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:13,380
present no unfortunately we will not be doing a normal cage match tonight so

1307
01:41:13,380 --> 01:41:16,780
Gwen Stefani wins another week by default because if we did a cage match

1308
01:41:16,780 --> 01:41:21,000
without dark Sakura there'd be hell to pay

1309
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:29,720
instead of pissing off Jamie we're gonna piss off Loki because pissing off Loki

1310
01:41:29,720 --> 01:41:44,040
is funnier by doing a drum roll please karaoke cage match alright guys here's

1311
01:41:44,040 --> 01:41:49,640
the way the karaoke cage match is gonna work just like the typical cage match

1312
01:41:49,640 --> 01:41:52,960
where there's gonna be three songs so you're gonna get to pick from and the

1313
01:41:52,960 --> 01:41:56,680
favorite that you pick will go into rotation all week long on orange lounge

1314
01:41:56,680 --> 01:42:03,280
radio just like any other song all right but the deal is is that instead of it

1315
01:42:03,280 --> 01:42:07,640
being songs that are out there you know and it's like just songs that we pick

1316
01:42:07,640 --> 01:42:11,640
out of the blue like we usually do they will be songs sung by folks in the

1317
01:42:11,640 --> 01:42:17,800
studio tonight via karaoke revolution volume 3 and this is a good way for us

1318
01:42:17,800 --> 01:42:23,800
to check out this game as well so now you see why Loki's pissed

1319
01:42:23,800 --> 01:42:29,800
all night, do not do this segment, do not do the damn segment, do not do the damn segment.

1320
01:42:29,800 --> 01:42:36,800
Too bad. Alright, so who's going to start off tonight? Me and you are going to go on

1321
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:39,800
a girl, you want to start it off? If you want. Alright, let's start it off, we're going to

1322
01:42:39,800 --> 01:42:42,800
start off. Alright, we're going to go over to karaoke revolution volume 3, and I'm going

1323
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:45,800
to give the mic to Loki so he can vent a little bit of his anger while we set up for song

1324
01:42:45,800 --> 01:42:50,800
number 1. To hell with all you people, I should have never bought that damn game. Fuck my

1325
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:57,800
my girlfriend. I know. God dammit. I don't like this game very much. Alright. What do

1326
01:42:57,800 --> 01:43:02,800
God dammit.

1327
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:07,800
I don't like this game very much.

1328
01:43:07,800 --> 01:43:12,800
Alright.

1329
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:17,800
What do we got?

1330
01:43:17,800 --> 01:43:22,800
So what are you going to play?

1331
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:30,080
And the love shack, and the do what?

1332
01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:36,760
Wanna girl and I are going to do love shack, so is it going to pick up over the mics here

1333
01:43:36,760 --> 01:43:38,480
or do we need to have the mics here by the way?

1334
01:43:38,480 --> 01:43:43,400
It will pick up over the mics, no it will pick up over the mics.

1335
01:43:43,400 --> 01:43:50,800
The love shack is a little old place where we can get together.

1336
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:52,800
Don't worry about me.

1337
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:54,800
All right.

1338
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:56,800
I love karaoke revolution.

1339
01:43:56,800 --> 01:43:58,800
I dislike this game.

1340
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:02,800
The hell with you people.

1341
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:03,800
It's a true duet.

1342
01:44:03,800 --> 01:44:05,800
How come the male vocalist is a chick? That's what I want to know.

1343
01:44:05,800 --> 01:44:07,800
I don't know.

1344
01:44:08,800 --> 01:44:10,800
Enter.

1345
01:44:11,800 --> 01:44:13,800
Yeah, he can do it.

1346
01:44:13,800 --> 01:44:14,800
No.

1347
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:29,200
If you see a faded sign at the side of the road that says 15 miles to the sunshine, sunshine

1348
01:44:29,200 --> 01:44:55,560
I got me a car, it's as big as a whale We're headin' on down to the love shack

01:45:33,560 --> 01:45:38,560
Stay away, it's the love, it's the love child

1357
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:41,560
We're back, we're back In the middle of a field

Glitter on the front porch Glitter on the highway

Bloodshot, baby, no shame!

1399
01:49:09,680 --> 01:49:33,680
Let's go around the room and see what everybody thought of that.

1400
01:49:33,680 --> 01:49:36,680
I'm getting some feedback there from the chatroom, we'll see.

1401
01:49:36,680 --> 01:49:39,680
Alright, let's go around the room and see what everybody thought of that.

1402
01:49:39,680 --> 01:49:41,680
Starting with Islander.

1403
01:49:41,680 --> 01:49:43,680
That was good performance.

1404
01:49:43,680 --> 01:49:46,680
And on a scale of one to ten?

1405
01:49:46,680 --> 01:49:48,680
Seven point five to eight.

1406
01:49:48,680 --> 01:49:49,680
Loki.

1407
01:49:49,680 --> 01:49:54,680
I give it a zero because you have the dumbest fucking segment ever.

1408
01:49:54,680 --> 01:49:59,680
To hell with you, I'm never letting you run a show ever again by yourself.

1409
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:01,680
No.

1410
01:50:01,680 --> 01:50:03,680
Hey baby, Ted!

1411
01:50:03,680 --> 01:50:05,680
Aw, you're just kissing my ass.

1412
01:50:05,680 --> 01:50:07,680
Jonas, you just walked in. Expose it.

1413
01:50:09,680 --> 01:50:11,680
Okay, I just walked in, and I...

1414
01:50:11,680 --> 01:50:13,680
I have to say it's five.

1415
01:50:13,680 --> 01:50:15,680
It's for...

1416
01:50:15,680 --> 01:50:17,680
For good...

1417
01:50:17,680 --> 01:50:19,680
Okay, let's play it first, but that'll be my risk for it a bit.

1418
01:50:22,680 --> 01:50:24,680
Hey, what the hell's with the granny?

1419
01:50:24,680 --> 01:50:26,680
What the hell?

1420
01:50:26,680 --> 01:50:28,680
What?

1421
01:50:28,680 --> 01:50:30,680
Granny's rockin'.

1422
01:50:30,680 --> 01:50:33,680
Alright, Islander's next. What song are you going to sing for us, Islander?

1423
01:50:33,680 --> 01:50:36,680
Oh lord, let me take a look at the list here. Uh oh.

1424
01:50:36,680 --> 01:50:39,680
Not that list. Wrong.

1425
01:50:39,680 --> 01:50:41,680
Let's try this again.

1426
01:50:41,680 --> 01:51:06,760
It's going through and finding a song right now, what he wants to sing.

1427
01:51:06,760 --> 01:51:09,520
He's thinking about the Fugees but passed on it.

1428
01:51:09,520 --> 01:51:16,520
and

1429
01:51:18,520 --> 01:51:21,680
abc

1430
01:51:21,680 --> 01:51:23,240
against all odds is in there

1431
01:51:23,240 --> 01:51:26,040
you guys know that one from ddr

1432
01:51:26,040 --> 01:51:29,880
thinking about who the fake

1433
01:51:29,880 --> 01:51:31,400
he's giving his not

1434
01:51:31,400 --> 01:51:34,280
any hit the x button you stuck with it now

1435
01:51:34,280 --> 01:51:37,280
Islander, song number two in tonight's cage match.

1436
01:51:37,280 --> 01:51:40,280
Wrong way.

1437
01:51:40,280 --> 01:51:43,280
My check, my check.

1438
01:51:43,280 --> 01:51:44,280
We good.

1439
01:51:44,280 --> 01:51:46,280
All right, song number two in tonight's cage match.

1440
01:51:46,280 --> 01:51:49,280
Islander, the reason.

1441
01:51:49,280 --> 01:51:54,280
I wish this was volume one because in that song I could do, oh hell,

1442
01:51:54,280 --> 01:51:56,280
from vertical horizon.

1443
01:51:56,280 --> 01:52:20,280
I'm not a perfect person There's many things I wish I didn't do

1444
01:52:20,280 --> 01:52:25,280
I said that, but it's good I present it to you

1445
01:52:27,280 --> 01:52:32,280
I never meant to do the things to you

1446
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:38,280
And so I have to save it for a girl

1447
01:52:39,280 --> 01:52:44,280
That I just wanted to know

1448
01:52:44,280 --> 01:52:56,280
I found a reason for me To change who I used to be

1449
01:52:56,280 --> 01:53:08,280
A reason to start over new And the reason is new

1450
01:53:08,280 --> 01:53:13,280
Don't believe that I hurt you

1451
01:53:13,280 --> 01:53:19,280
It's nothing I must've worked for today

1452
01:53:19,280 --> 01:53:25,280
And all the pain I put you through

1453
01:53:25,280 --> 01:53:31,280
I wish that I could take it all away

1454
01:53:31,280 --> 01:53:37,280
And be the one who catches all your tears

1455
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:42,280
That's why I needed you here

1456
01:53:42,280 --> 01:53:48,280
I found out a reason for me

1457
01:53:48,280 --> 01:53:54,280
It changed who I used to be

1458
01:53:54,280 --> 01:54:01,280
A reason to start over new

1459
01:54:01,280 --> 01:54:06,280
The elementary isn't...

1460
01:54:07,280 --> 01:54:12,280
The elementary isn't...

1461
01:54:13,280 --> 01:54:18,280
The elementary isn't...

1462
01:54:19,280 --> 01:54:24,280
The elementary isn't...

1463
01:54:24,280 --> 01:54:40,280
I'm not a perfect person, I never meant to do those things to you

1464
01:54:40,280 --> 01:54:46,280
And so I have to stay with forever

1465
01:54:46,280 --> 01:54:51,280
That I just wanted to know

1466
01:54:51,280 --> 01:54:57,280
I found a reason for me

1467
01:54:57,280 --> 01:55:03,280
To change who I used to be

1468
01:55:03,280 --> 01:55:10,280
A reason that's not over new

1469
01:55:10,280 --> 01:55:15,280
And the reason is new

1470
01:55:15,280 --> 01:55:21,280
I found a reason to show

1471
01:55:21,280 --> 01:55:27,280
A sign of me you may know

1472
01:55:27,280 --> 01:55:33,280
A reason for all that I do

1473
01:55:33,280 --> 01:55:39,280
A reason is you

1474
01:55:39,280 --> 01:55:47,280
All the girls there are swooning for Islander.

1475
01:55:47,280 --> 01:55:49,840
I know that was painful for a lot of people to listen to because it was painful for me

1476
01:55:49,840 --> 01:55:50,840
to sing.

1477
01:55:50,840 --> 01:55:51,840
That's right.

1478
01:55:51,840 --> 01:55:53,840
Let's go around and see what everybody thought of that.

1479
01:55:53,840 --> 01:55:54,840
Iguana Girl.

1480
01:55:54,840 --> 01:55:55,840
I still love you.

1481
01:55:55,840 --> 01:55:56,840
It's okay.

1482
01:55:56,840 --> 01:55:57,840
Yay.

1483
01:55:57,840 --> 01:56:02,080
It was a little quiet, but I dug it.

1484
01:56:02,080 --> 01:56:08,240
I think you would get girls throwing their panties at you any day.

1485
01:56:08,240 --> 01:56:10,240
tonight if you're lucky. I give it a 7.

1486
01:56:10,240 --> 01:56:12,240
That might be wrong!

1487
01:56:12,240 --> 01:56:14,240
Loki.

1488
01:56:14,240 --> 01:56:16,240
I give one more finger up to Rob.

1489
01:56:16,240 --> 01:56:18,240
That is it.

1490
01:56:18,240 --> 01:56:20,240
That wasn't painful.

1491
01:56:20,240 --> 01:56:22,240
Just give it a couple more minutes.

1492
01:56:24,240 --> 01:56:26,240
I fucking hate this.

1493
01:56:26,240 --> 01:56:28,240
Angel. Hey, that was really good.

1494
01:56:28,240 --> 01:56:30,240
I'm going to give it an 8 just because

1495
01:56:30,240 --> 01:56:32,240
I can.

1496
01:56:32,240 --> 01:56:34,240
Well, I don't have anything to say.

1497
01:56:34,240 --> 01:56:36,240
It was good.

1498
01:56:36,240 --> 01:56:44,240
There's a couple parts that, you know, did get choked on, but it's all good. It was really good, and you almost sounded like the real guy, so that's cool.

1499
01:56:44,240 --> 01:56:48,240
All right. All right, Loki. What song is Loki gonna sing?

1500
01:56:48,240 --> 01:56:49,240
No.

1501
01:56:49,240 --> 01:56:54,240
Huh? Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, explicit. When he walked in, he was tardy. What can you do?

1502
01:56:54,240 --> 01:56:58,240
I know, I know. Well, I'll be Stick Judge from Simon's View.

1503
01:56:58,240 --> 01:57:02,240
Okay. I don't wanna fuckin' play this.

1504
01:57:02,240 --> 01:57:07,240
Well, you did choke on some parts, but you did pretty good.

1505
01:57:07,240 --> 01:57:09,240
Give it a 7.5.

1506
01:57:09,240 --> 01:57:13,980
the next round all right here comes Loki and he's so excited to be performing

1507
01:57:13,980 --> 01:57:21,960

Once you are high, take your fucking gun

02:00:14,400 --> 02:00:17,400
Make a piece of what you've done

1535

Don't touch it

1536
02:00:19,400 --> 02:00:24,400

Oops, I did it again

1551
02:01:55,200 --> 02:01:58,200

1552
02:01:58,200 --> 02:02:00,200
People laughing in the rain

1553
02:02:00,200 --> 02:02:02,200
Ooh, baby, baby

1554
02:02:02,200 --> 02:02:05,200
Oops, you think that you said

1555
02:02:05,200 --> 02:02:09,200
When you go to sleep

1556
02:02:09,200 --> 02:02:12,200
But they're all through with the first turn

1557
02:02:12,200 --> 02:02:15,200
Oops, I did it again

1558
02:02:15,200 --> 02:02:18,200
I had to hide their bodies

1559
02:02:18,200 --> 02:02:22,200
It's time we're away, covering the way

1560
02:02:22,200 --> 02:02:25,200
Oops, you think it's a good time

1561
02:02:25,200 --> 02:02:29,200
And I'm not about to stand here tonight

1562
02:02:29,200 --> 02:02:32,200
I've stuck it, I'm not even trying at all

1563
02:02:35,200 --> 02:02:37,200
I fucking hate this game!

1564
02:02:37,200 --> 02:02:39,200
God damn you, Konami!

1565
02:02:39,200 --> 02:02:41,200
God damn you!

1566
02:02:41,200 --> 02:02:56,200
You know, the listeners are going to vote this number one for a week on end.

1567
02:02:56,200 --> 02:02:58,600
Let's go around the room and see what everybody thought of that one, starting with the Guana

1568
02:02:58,600 --> 02:02:59,600
Girl.

1569
02:02:59,600 --> 02:03:00,600
I thought it was fabulous.

1570
02:03:00,600 --> 02:03:03,520
Oh my god, I just can't believe it.

1571
02:03:03,520 --> 02:03:04,520
It's a ten.

1572
02:03:04,520 --> 02:03:05,520
It's a ten.

1573
02:03:05,520 --> 02:03:06,520
Islander.

1574
02:03:06,520 --> 02:03:09,520
It was so fabulous, I created my pants.

1575
02:03:09,520 --> 02:03:24,880
I think he was one of those that got, you know, attacked with a butcher knife, and...

1576
02:03:24,880 --> 02:03:25,880
He's like, ugh!

1577
02:03:25,880 --> 02:03:26,880
He's alive!

1578
02:03:26,880 --> 02:03:38,400
Uh, as for my thoughts, I give it a ten, and can I sleep over at your place tonight?

1579
02:03:38,400 --> 02:03:39,400
Wanna go home?

1580
02:03:39,400 --> 02:04:01,840

I don't want to talk about it

1586
02:04:43,960 --> 02:04:45,960
Talk about it now, I need to

1587
02:04:45,960 --> 02:04:47,960

We've got to let them go

02:06:18,460 --> 02:06:22,460
Do you think I'm perfect? Yeah, night's on fire

1611
02:06:22,460 --> 02:06:25,460
You better, better think You better, better think

1612
02:07:25,460 --> 02:07:30,460
Baby, I don't want to die, you won't get it

1613
02:07:30,460 --> 02:07:33,460
If there was no better place, baby

1614
02:07:33,460 --> 02:07:36,460
Say hello to me, cause I wanna see

1615
02:07:36,460 --> 02:07:40,460
Wanna see the color of the blue eyes, baby

1616
02:07:40,460 --> 02:07:43,460
This is the night, when we see the light

1617
02:07:43,460 --> 02:07:46,460
I'll set fire burning in my heart for your big love

1618
02:07:46,460 --> 02:07:49,460
Gotta break, medicate, do something special

1619
02:07:49,460 --> 02:07:52,460
This is the dedication of the magic moment

1620
02:08:22,460 --> 02:08:46,980
Orange Lounge Radio, we put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.

1621
02:08:46,980 --> 02:09:03,500
It's time to reveal the winner of tonight's cage match.

1622
02:09:03,500 --> 02:09:08,380
And the winner of tonight's cage match is Loki with Oops I Did It Again.

1623
02:09:08,380 --> 02:09:11,220
Why are we all surprised?

1624
02:09:11,220 --> 02:09:12,220
You know what though?

1625
02:09:12,220 --> 02:09:16,820
The other two songs got a surprising amount of pity votes, so I was very pleased.

1626
02:09:16,820 --> 02:09:20,260
The effort did not go unappreciated by the rest of us.

1627
02:09:20,260 --> 02:09:22,620
We knew that Loki was going to cream us though.

1628
02:09:22,620 --> 02:09:26,100
Can I have a hug, Loki?

1629
02:09:26,100 --> 02:09:27,100
No!

1630
02:09:27,100 --> 02:09:31,660
He's taking off his aggressions on Mario 64 right now, so what can you do?

1631
02:09:31,660 --> 02:09:33,780
I know, like, what is that?

1632
02:09:33,780 --> 02:09:40,020
Why are you holding two DS's over there, Angel?

1633
02:09:40,020 --> 02:09:41,580
You guys are crazy.

1634
02:09:41,580 --> 02:09:42,580
Alright.

1635
02:09:42,580 --> 02:09:46,700
Congratulations, Loki, for winning tonight's cage match.

1636
02:09:46,700 --> 02:09:49,780
I thought it was funny because one person when they voted I was going through the votes

1637
02:09:49,780 --> 02:09:53,380
one person said this is the only time you'll ever see me voting for Britney.

1638
02:09:53,380 --> 02:09:57,940
I thought that was funny.

1639
02:09:57,940 --> 02:10:05,380
Alright, we're going to do some winners for the Midihead CDs, so hurry up, last chance

1640
02:10:05,380 --> 02:10:06,380
to get in.

1641
02:10:06,380 --> 02:10:10,100
Free stuff at orangeontrader.com and also he said he was still taking some stuff on

1642
02:10:10,100 --> 02:10:12,260
his site over at midihead.com too.

1643
02:10:12,260 --> 02:10:19,140
use the email little bubble on his site and there's a little submission form. Very cool.

1644
02:10:19,140 --> 02:10:23,380
And we got, we got that song that he wanted to play earlier. It's actually, I believe

1645
02:10:23,380 --> 02:10:26,700
it's an unreleased track, so I'm pretty excited we're going to be playing an unreleased track

1646
02:10:26,700 --> 02:10:31,100
of his later. So, very excited we're going to be hearing that. In that break, before

1647
02:10:31,100 --> 02:10:35,500
we came back, you heard some music from Para Para Paradise. You know that game. Whatever

1648
02:10:35,500 --> 02:10:39,620
happened to that game? Why did that game have to die? It was one of those games that was

1649
02:10:39,620 --> 02:10:41,620
Cool when it first came out and then it sucked.

1650
02:10:41,620 --> 02:10:43,120
And then it was cool again.

1651
02:10:43,120 --> 02:10:47,120
What was cool about that game is that when we first played it, we had no idea what the hell Parapara was.

1652
02:10:47,120 --> 02:10:52,120
And then we learned, and then it just wasn't as cool as it was.

1653
02:10:52,120 --> 02:10:54,120
I don't know.

1654
02:10:58,120 --> 02:11:00,120
I don't know, it was like one of those things where it was like...

1655
02:11:00,120 --> 02:11:05,120
I think it was cool when people didn't know that you had to do line dances to it, basically.

1656
02:11:05,120 --> 02:11:08,120
And then when you found out you had to do the synchronized dance it was kinda suck.

1657
02:11:08,120 --> 02:11:16,120
But some people really got into it, which is good for them, and then when people just started to have fun with it and not take it so seriously, I think it was cool again.

1658
02:11:16,120 --> 02:11:23,120
So I can go back and listen to that music any time now. There was a period there, though, where it was like, oh, para para. Oh, God.

1659
02:11:23,120 --> 02:11:28,120
Oh, you're upbeat. But no, I understand what you're saying about going back and listening to the music. Yeah.

1660
02:11:28,120 --> 02:11:32,560
Now, usually I don't give away who voted for who in the cage match, but Misty said it was

1661
02:11:32,560 --> 02:11:37,600
okay to say that that was her that voted and said that she didn't, it's the only time she'll

1662
02:11:37,600 --> 02:11:38,600
be voting for Brittany.

1663
02:11:38,600 --> 02:11:40,320
So, she wanted me to pass that along.

1664
02:11:40,320 --> 02:11:42,320
Just for you, Loki.

1665
02:11:42,320 --> 02:11:45,360
You're only encouraging them.

1666
02:11:45,360 --> 02:11:47,440
You're only encouraging them.

1667
02:11:47,440 --> 02:11:53,400
All right, um, so, um, Iguana Girl, I noticed some folks in the chat room right now are

1668
02:11:53,400 --> 02:11:57,800
talking about Disney's rave and some of the non-stops, so it's kind of making me think,

1669
02:11:57,800 --> 02:12:01,320
How did everything go over for Thanksgiving with your guys' non-stop marathon?

1670
02:12:01,320 --> 02:12:03,040
Very, very well.

1671
02:12:03,040 --> 02:12:07,080
We had some large listener counts on both days.

1672
02:12:07,080 --> 02:12:10,680
I really hadn't anticipated on doing both days because I didn't, you know, you know

1673
02:12:10,680 --> 02:12:16,600
how you have, you know, your TBS version of A Christmas Story, how they'll play it for

1674
02:12:16,600 --> 02:12:20,600
like 24 hours straight and just wipe everybody out on it.

1675
02:12:20,600 --> 02:12:21,600
Burnout.

1676
02:12:21,600 --> 02:12:22,600
Yeah.

1677
02:12:22,600 --> 02:12:23,600
You'll shoot your eye out.

1678
02:12:23,600 --> 02:12:24,600
Okay.

1679
02:12:24,600 --> 02:12:25,600
Exactly.

1680
02:12:25,600 --> 02:12:26,600
Exactly.

1681
02:12:26,600 --> 02:12:29,800
for that type of a situation.

1682
02:12:29,800 --> 02:12:32,320
So I went ahead and just did a single day,

1683
02:12:32,320 --> 02:12:34,600
and I did it on Thanksgiving, and then the following day.

1684
02:12:34,600 --> 02:12:39,800
And not quite as many people on the Friday rebroadcast,

1685
02:12:39,800 --> 02:12:42,760
but still very, very respectable.

1686
02:12:42,760 --> 02:12:43,840
A lot of people tuned in.

1687
02:12:43,840 --> 02:12:45,240
It was great.

1688
02:12:45,240 --> 02:12:48,880
And then, of course, we did the Orange Lounge Rewind

1689
02:12:48,880 --> 02:12:49,600
directly after.

1690
02:12:49,600 --> 02:12:52,200
So I'm hoping that we got some of those people to listen in.

1691
02:12:52,200 --> 02:12:54,120
So I got you guys some more exposure, too.

1692
02:12:54,120 --> 02:12:54,480
Cool deal.

1693
02:12:54,480 --> 02:12:55,320
Thank you very much.

1694
02:12:55,320 --> 02:12:56,320
We appreciate the help.

1695
02:12:56,320 --> 02:13:00,320
Anything else exciting coming up on DDR Freak Radio in the near future?

1696
02:13:00,320 --> 02:13:01,320
Not at the present time.

1697
02:13:01,320 --> 02:13:08,520
I'm trying to work with one of the moderators on a side project to see if maybe we can get

1698
02:13:08,520 --> 02:13:13,120
that kind of working, but I don't know when that's going to be coming up.

1699
02:13:13,120 --> 02:13:15,880
I'm sure you guys will hear all about it by the time it's ready.

1700
02:13:15,880 --> 02:13:17,880
Oh, I'm sure we will.

1701
02:13:17,880 --> 02:13:23,400
We should do something for the end of the year, think of something to do, do a countdown

1702
02:13:23,400 --> 02:13:24,400
or something.

1703
02:13:24,400 --> 02:13:25,400
It'll be fun.

1704
02:13:25,400 --> 02:13:27,240
Well, you're going to be at my place anyway.

1705
02:13:27,240 --> 02:13:27,740
That's true.

1706
02:13:27,740 --> 02:13:28,240
That's true.

1707
02:13:28,240 --> 02:13:29,080
So maybe we should.

1708
02:13:29,080 --> 02:13:29,660
Live broadcast, maybe?

1709
02:13:29,660 --> 02:13:30,160
Maybe.

1710
02:13:30,160 --> 02:13:30,840
We'll see.

1711
02:13:30,840 --> 02:13:34,360
And also, I hear that there's a reunion show in the works

1712
02:13:34,360 --> 02:13:35,720
for Understadation Live.

1713
02:13:35,720 --> 02:13:36,520
Yeah.

1714
02:13:36,520 --> 02:13:38,200
Got contacted about that one today.

1715
02:13:38,200 --> 02:13:39,520
That should be interesting.

1716
02:13:39,520 --> 02:13:41,360
For those that don't know, Iguana Girl and I

1717
02:13:41,360 --> 02:13:44,420
used to be co-hosts on a show over on another station,

1718
02:13:44,420 --> 02:13:46,600
Understadation Live, which is still going, by the way.

1719
02:13:46,600 --> 02:13:47,520
Still kicking.

1720
02:13:47,520 --> 02:13:49,100
Over on Live 365.

1721
02:13:49,100 --> 02:13:50,840
Understadationlive.org is the site.

1722
02:13:50,840 --> 02:13:51,680
Go check it out.

1723
02:13:51,680 --> 02:13:53,160
And there's going to be a reunion show coming up

1724
02:13:53,160 --> 02:13:54,200
with Iguana Girl and myself.

1725
02:13:54,200 --> 02:13:55,000
That should be fun.

1726
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:58,000
I believe DarkSakauro is going to be in on it too, because she was a big part of it.

1727
02:13:58,000 --> 02:13:59,000
Yeah, she was a big part of it.

1728
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:01,000
She was the most frequent, no, Islander or her?

1729
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:05,000
One or her, either her or Islander were the most frequent guests at the end of it.

1730
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:10,000
Yeah, so it'll probably be a situation where we'll all just hang out in one room and then

1731
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:15,000
Skype with Travis Donovan over there and see if we can get it all working.

1732
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:16,000
Very cool.

1733
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
See if we can recapture the magic.

1734
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:21,000
Yes, even though it'll kind of be virtual a little bit.

1735
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:22,000
Yeah.

1736
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:26,000
I won't be able to throw any of his figures at me, which will be kind of sad, but you know, we can't do it.

1737
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
And I won't be able to see the white boy dance.

1738
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:29,000
No white boy dance.

1739
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:31,000
We'll have to get him a webcam or something.

1740
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:35,000
No piles and piles of cigarette butts in the ashtray.

1741
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:40,000
I kind of also brought up DDR Freak for a reason, because I was kind of reading, you know,

1742
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:44,000
as a lot of people in the Bomani scene do, I was reading the message boards over there.

1743
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:48,000
And a little bit of spatting going on in the UltraMix 2 thread right now.

1744
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:49,000
A little bit of spatting.

1745
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:50,000
Really? I don't like that.

1746
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:54,120
I know, but nothing that needs, you know, moderation going on or

1747
02:14:54,120 --> 02:14:55,140
anything, but just, you know,

1748
02:14:55,140 --> 02:14:59,120
some people are a little upset with UltraMix 2 saying the timing

1749
02:14:59,120 --> 02:15:02,320
is a big issue and they're saying we need a patch

1750
02:15:02,320 --> 02:15:05,480
for UltraMix 2, dear KCEH,

1751
02:15:05,480 --> 02:15:09,080
patch UltraMix 2, the timing is screwed up and it's

1752
02:15:09,080 --> 02:15:12,600
screwing up my PA. Didn't they do this already before?

1753
02:15:12,600 --> 02:15:17,040
Yeah, isn't this the same

1754
02:15:17,040 --> 02:15:22,000
gripe that they've had. It's interesting, with every new mix that comes out, first bitch,

1755
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:26,200
the steps, second bitch, the timing, third bitch, the song list. Nothing is enough. Nothing

1756
02:15:26,200 --> 02:15:32,820
is enough. Drives me bonkers. You know what, yeah. The nice thing is that nobody was really

1757
02:15:32,820 --> 02:15:36,400
bitching about the song list or the steps this time. So I think the timing. Well, no,

1758
02:15:36,400 --> 02:15:42,080
they have to bitch about something. It would not be, you know, in a consumer-run society,

1759
02:15:42,080 --> 02:15:47,560
me, they have to bitch about something. Yes, exactly. They have to bitch about something.

1760
02:15:47,560 --> 02:15:50,600
No matter what, they have to bitch about something. So I guess, you know, we just have to kind

1761
02:15:50,600 --> 02:15:55,800
of deal with it and kind of ignore the idiots as much as we can.

1762
02:15:55,800 --> 02:16:00,200
And you know, I'm trying to look at both sides of it. You know, I try to take, you know,

1763
02:16:00,200 --> 02:16:04,660
perspective. Okay, I got to see both sides of points of view here. And yeah, the timing

1764
02:16:04,660 --> 02:16:08,640
window is a little different from the arcade. But that's the thing. UltraMix is not the

1765
02:16:08,640 --> 02:16:12,840
arcade and I think that's what a lot of people often forget is that DDR in the

1766
02:16:12,840 --> 02:16:17,340
arcade right now here in the US is six feet under now is there a chance that

1767
02:16:17,340 --> 02:16:22,300
it will rise from the grave and you know kick some ass again in the arcade we

1768
02:16:22,300 --> 02:16:25,860
hope so we really really hope so but for now you know home version is what we got

1769
02:16:25,860 --> 02:16:30,900
and I don't know I just I think these the comparisons to extreme and the other

1770
02:16:30,900 --> 02:16:35,460
Japanese mixes are very interesting when you consider that they're not even

1771
02:16:35,460 --> 02:16:42,660
really supposed to be here. You know what I mean? So, I don't know. I can kind of see

1772
02:16:42,660 --> 02:16:48,140
why there might be a difference too in the fact that you're dealing with completely different

1773
02:16:48,140 --> 02:16:52,100
hardware and you're dealing with an engine that was probably written from the ground

1774
02:16:52,100 --> 02:16:55,940
up. It wasn't really written to emulate the arcade, it was written to be something new

1775
02:16:55,940 --> 02:16:59,140
and I think that's what a lot of people have grown to appreciate about UltraMix too. You

1776
02:16:59,140 --> 02:17:02,620
know what I mean? Where it's kind of like, it's supposed to be something new. So it's

1777
02:17:02,620 --> 02:17:09,960
not going to get it 100%, but I don't know. Well, like I said, it's going to be something.

1778
02:17:09,960 --> 02:17:15,640
It's always going to be something, no matter what. And it's frustrating that people can't

1779
02:17:15,640 --> 02:17:19,800
just appreciate the fact that we are getting these new mixes and that these are things

1780
02:17:19,800 --> 02:17:27,120
that we, how long ago weren't expecting to get any of? I mean, what, less than two years

1781
02:17:27,120 --> 02:17:32,440
ago? We were having to import everything? So, personally, I'm just thankful the fact

1782
02:17:32,440 --> 02:17:37,040
that we have these mixes and the fact that we're getting, that we have, you know, people

1783
02:17:37,040 --> 02:17:39,560
that are interested enough in it to keep us going.

1784
02:17:39,560 --> 02:17:43,080
And I'm not going to say that people who are complaining about it are not thankful because

1785
02:17:43,080 --> 02:17:46,720
chances are they are. They probably love the game. They just, you know, they want to find

1786
02:17:46,720 --> 02:17:48,760
ways... They're not expressing it and that's my concern.

1787
02:17:48,760 --> 02:17:54,960
They want to find ways to make it better. Yeah, but there's ways to go about that. And

1788
02:17:54,960 --> 02:18:03,880
bitching on a message board. Namely, DDR Freak is not the way to go about doing so. Write

1789
02:18:03,880 --> 02:18:08,880
your complaints in a letter. Send it to the appropriate parties. Don't just bitch about

1790
02:18:08,880 --> 02:18:14,720
it on a message board. We don't need it. You're going to get your thread locked. We don't

1791
02:18:14,720 --> 02:18:19,820
need the drama. We got enough drama on our own. Here's the other big drama is that people

1792
02:18:19,820 --> 02:18:25,020
are bitching about song pack 7. The song pack 7 has a bunch of repeats in it. And this

1793
02:18:25,020 --> 02:18:30,100
is, let me tell you guys about what's in song pack 7 right now for Ultramix 2. Let me see

1794
02:18:30,100 --> 02:18:37,900
if I can pull it up here. Cause I have the list up on OrangeLoungeRadio.com. Let's see,

1795
02:18:37,900 --> 02:18:43,940
here it is. Era, End of the Century, La Senorita, Silent Hill, and I Feel the Junk Circuit Mix.

1796
02:18:43,940 --> 02:18:49,560
So you got four songs in there that are old DDR classics. This is what, and a lot of people

1797
02:18:49,560 --> 02:18:54,160
are saying, it ain't worth it, we've played these songs to death. Then don't buy it. And

1798
02:18:54,160 --> 02:18:57,440
a lot of people are expressing they're not going to, which is, you know, fine, but this

1799
02:18:57,440 --> 02:19:00,440
is one of those things where I kind of see it's really, Konami is in a damned if you

1800
02:19:00,440 --> 02:19:04,200
do, damned if you don't situation, because when they don't give us these songs, people

1801
02:19:04,200 --> 02:19:10,920
go, there's not enough of the Japanese mixes in the game. So I'm kind of like, these songs

1802
02:19:10,920 --> 02:19:16,860
here are like staple DDR songs, have never been on the Xbox before, so if you're not

1803
02:19:16,860 --> 02:19:24,580
a PS2 owner, this is a got to do. Just like if you're not an Xbox owner, Festival is probably

1804
02:19:24,580 --> 02:19:27,660
great for you. Whereas a lot of people are hating on it because they're saying, ah, it's

1805
02:19:27,660 --> 02:19:31,660
just a copy of the Xbox version. Well, yeah, but if I were living in Japan and I didn't

1806
02:19:31,660 --> 02:19:35,980
import my games from the US, which I imagine not a lot of people do, I'd probably love

1807
02:19:35,980 --> 02:19:43,100
it. So, I don't know. I think a lot of the people are just kind of taking it with a grain

1808
02:19:43,100 --> 02:19:49,500
us all at this point. I mean, you can't take it personally. You can't, you know, take a

1809
02:19:49,500 --> 02:19:53,460
lot of the complaints to heart. Oh yeah, oh yeah, and I don't think, and I know most people

1810
02:19:53,460 --> 02:19:57,900
at Konami probably don't, and they probably do take each criticism, you know, they probably

1811
02:19:57,900 --> 02:20:02,980
say, okay, you know, maybe we could... Yeah, but after about the 15th billionth time...

1812
02:20:02,980 --> 02:20:07,000
Maybe next, maybe in the next song pack, just two or three of these songs, and then two

1813
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:12,180
or three new songs, and maybe people would be happier, I don't know. But, I don't know.

1814
02:20:12,180 --> 02:20:15,480
I agree, I think they're in a damn if you do damn if you don't situation.

1815
02:20:15,480 --> 02:20:19,480
There's five more song packs to go, boys and girls. I think the best is still yet to come.

1816
02:20:19,480 --> 02:20:23,180
I think one of the better song packs for UltraMix 1 was one of the later ones.

1817
02:20:23,180 --> 02:20:26,780
I want to say it was Song Pack 4 was a really good one.

1818
02:20:26,780 --> 02:20:30,380
Honestly, hold on to your butts.

1819
02:20:30,380 --> 02:20:32,880
It's going to be a fun ride. I think there's going to be better...

1820
02:20:32,880 --> 02:20:39,080
I mean, I will probably buy this song pack anyway just so I can play these songs on Xbox Live

1821
02:20:39,080 --> 02:20:41,880
because I would like to play Era on Xbox Live because I love TAC.

1822
02:20:41,880 --> 02:20:49,880
So, you know, that's enough to seal the deal for me right there, is that we haven't had a lot of these songs in 60 frames a second and, you know, on Xbox Live before, so, why not?

1823
02:20:49,880 --> 02:20:53,880
But, um, if you're not gonna buy it, then fine, I won't play you.

1824
02:20:53,880 --> 02:20:55,880
See if I care.

1825
02:20:55,880 --> 02:20:58,880
Alright, they want us to get to the FUs of the Week.

1826
02:20:58,880 --> 02:21:02,880
Well, who cares? They don't run the radio show!

1827
02:21:02,880 --> 02:21:08,640
That is true, they don't run the radio show but they are our listeners and we want to

1828
02:21:08,640 --> 02:21:13,900
keep them happy so we probably should get to the FUs of the week and so this is the

1829
02:21:13,900 --> 02:21:17,820
part of the show where I would ask Jamie why do we have to do these FUs of the week every

1830
02:21:17,820 --> 02:21:25,020
single week and this is the part where she'd tell me something like because we're angry.

1831
02:21:25,020 --> 02:21:27,620
Because we're not all happy little bunnies.

1832
02:21:27,620 --> 02:21:42,620
Very good.

1833
02:21:42,620 --> 02:21:50,100
On behalf of Jamie, I'll just enter in an F.U. to old people, drivers, stupid people,

1834
02:21:50,100 --> 02:21:57,480
uneducated people, what else does Jamie, what are her names, customers, yeah so.

1835
02:21:57,480 --> 02:22:00,480
I think I probably hit on something in there. I hope. We'll see.

1836
02:22:00,480 --> 02:22:02,480
Hurricanes. That too.

1837
02:22:02,480 --> 02:22:03,480
Life prices. Maybe, you know what?

1838
02:22:03,480 --> 02:22:04,480
Yeah, flight prices.

1839
02:22:04,480 --> 02:22:07,480
She's probably pissed off at jet lag right now, being in Alabama.

1840
02:22:07,480 --> 02:22:08,480
Yeah.

1841
02:22:08,480 --> 02:22:12,480
And I'm sure she's missing us really badly.

1842
02:22:12,480 --> 02:22:16,480
She would give an F.U. to missing Sky and Loki and the Guada Girl and Islander and everybody here.

1843
02:22:17,480 --> 02:22:19,480
Yeah, anyway, let's move on.

1844
02:22:19,480 --> 02:22:26,480
uh...

1845
02:22:26,960 --> 02:22:31,480
fuck you to mario sixty-four ds for being frustrating

1846
02:22:31,480 --> 02:22:34,880
no wonder i didn't have the original game it was too frustrating

1847
02:22:34,880 --> 02:22:39,600
and i want to throw my ds but then before i throw it i realize how expensive it was

1848
02:22:39,600 --> 02:22:43,620
and then don't throw it and continue to play the game and get frustrated even more

1849
02:22:43,620 --> 02:22:46,360
uh... anyway and also

1850
02:22:46,360 --> 02:22:50,960
Fuck you to leaves, there's still tons of them outside, and they're still piled up next to my car.

1851
02:22:50,960 --> 02:22:55,800
Speaking of car, fuck you to my car, cause it's broken in some way and I don't know why.

1852
02:22:55,800 --> 02:23:03,440
And the problem is, is I don't want to take another day off of work just to go down to the dealership and take my car down there so that they can tell me that they don't know what's wrong with it.

1853
02:23:03,440 --> 02:23:04,480
But it's broken.

1854
02:23:04,480 --> 02:23:14,680
Anyways, um, so it still drives, and I don't think it's anything major, like maybe the alignment's off or, you know, the brakes are falling off or something, but other than that, you know, it's fine.

1855
02:23:14,680 --> 02:23:33,680
Um, then, uh, really, I don't know, fuck you for wasting this entire four-day weekend on Final Fantasy XI, because I really didn't do anything, I didn't work on my cabinet, which I should've, and I didn't, you know, clean house or, you know, God knows what else, you know, visit family or something.

1856
02:23:33,680 --> 02:23:52,680
So that sucks. And, um, what else? Oh, just, um, fuck you to work, because, you know, a movie gallery's talking about buying Hollywood video, and that means that there'd be twice as many stupid people that I'd have to talk to every day. So that sucks.

1857
02:23:52,680 --> 02:24:15,000
I don't know why I bought that game and wasted my money, but whatever, okay I'm done.

1858
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:18,600
I escaped the FUs, I was so happy.

1859
02:24:48,600 --> 02:24:55,160
Xbox live because I'm not good at halo 2 f you to the fact that I'm not good at halo 2 makes me sad and

1860
02:24:57,040 --> 02:25:03,120
F you to see gird because he said that he would only be able to battle me on controller tonight on Xbox live

1861
02:25:03,280 --> 02:25:05,680
So we're gonna have to postpone the battle till later anyway

1862
02:25:05,680 --> 02:25:09,140
Cuz we're running out of time and we did the karaoke thing kind of bumped him

1863
02:25:09,140 --> 02:25:12,680
which I'm sure he's pleased about and he'll probably give me an F you about that later, but we'll see and

1864
02:25:12,680 --> 02:25:16,680
Otherwise, I think I'm okay.

1865
02:25:16,680 --> 02:25:17,680
I've had a pretty good weekend.

1866
02:25:17,680 --> 02:25:21,680
I have a lot to be thankful for this Thanksgiving season.

1867
02:25:21,680 --> 02:25:29,880
And oh, I know, F you to whoever decided, my really, really good friend Christopher

1868
02:25:29,880 --> 02:25:35,160
was in the hospital for his appendix to have his appendix taken out, F you to whoever decided

1869
02:25:35,160 --> 02:25:39,000
to play a cruel joke on him and make him go back to have his gallbladder taken out two

1870
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:40,000
days later.

1871
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:41,000
That sucks.

1872
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:45,000
That sucks. Feel better soon, Christopher. We miss you.

1873
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:49,000
And fuck you, Comedy Central, for not having a new episode drawn together on this week.

1874
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:54,000
I have to wait fucking another week for a brand new episode, and that pisses me off.

1875
02:25:54,000 --> 02:26:00,000
But thank you for airing two nights in a row, South Park, bigger, longer, and uncut.

1876
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:04,000
And thank you for steering my FUs in a completely different direction.

1877
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:08,000
Let's move on to Iguana Girl. She's got a microphone.

1878
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:11,360
I have a microphone and I'm not afraid to use it.

1879
02:26:11,360 --> 02:26:14,880
Um, big huge F-U to

1880
02:26:14,880 --> 02:26:18,680
my car for having this really weird

1881
02:26:18,680 --> 02:26:24,680
really screwed up, like, brake problem that is inconsistent and only happens when it's

1882
02:26:24,680 --> 02:26:25,720
not raining and

1883
02:26:25,720 --> 02:26:28,960
now I also screw my car because

1884
02:26:28,960 --> 02:26:33,520
it decided to start making a squealing noise whenever I make a hard turn left

1885
02:26:33,520 --> 02:26:36,560
also. So, uh, yeah.

1886
02:26:36,560 --> 02:26:41,720
So this is like multiple issues that the people over at Pep Boys could not figure out and

1887
02:26:41,720 --> 02:26:46,120
now I have to take it to the dealership to have them look at it and tell me that I need

1888
02:26:46,120 --> 02:26:50,760
to spend like $1,000 to get it fixed or something like that.

1889
02:26:50,760 --> 02:26:56,880
And big huge fuck you to the fact that I actually had to work on Friday while all of you guys

1890
02:26:56,880 --> 02:26:59,520
were being lazy asses and had Friday off.

1891
02:26:59,520 --> 02:27:00,520
Yay!

1892
02:27:00,520 --> 02:27:02,520
Yay lazy!

1893
02:27:02,520 --> 02:27:07,520
Yes, being in retail-ish stuff sucks.

1894
02:27:07,520 --> 02:27:16,520
And a big huge F.U. to still having like two weeks off to school and a big huge F.U. to having to study for finals soon.

1895
02:27:16,520 --> 02:27:20,520
And that's about it.

1896
02:27:20,520 --> 02:27:23,520
Alright, let's move on to Islander.

1897
02:27:23,520 --> 02:27:25,520
Oh yeah, I've got a big F.U.

1898
02:27:25,520 --> 02:27:30,520
To the state of California for sending me a jury duty notice.

1899
02:27:30,520 --> 02:27:39,520
I faxed in the stuff that I needed to fax in saying, I cannot take time off from work, yada yada. I never got a response.

1900
02:27:39,520 --> 02:27:41,520
How lovely!

1901
02:27:41,520 --> 02:27:44,520
I'm glad you're not on the Peterson jury.

1902
02:27:44,520 --> 02:27:54,520
Really. So, unfortunately, tomorrow is supposed to be my day off. I have to go down to the courthouse and see if I get picked to serve an injury.

1903
02:27:54,520 --> 02:28:01,520
Oh, no, no, no. In my LJ, a good buddy of mine, a driver walkie, suggested walking into

1904
02:28:01,800 --> 02:28:06,240
the courthouse with a copy of the weekly world news to show how unintelligent I am, and I

1905
02:28:06,240 --> 02:28:13,240
think I'll do that. Fabulous. Second deaf view is actually also to the state of California

1906
02:28:13,320 --> 02:28:20,320
for a late penis on my car insurance, and they want to suspend my license. A big, huge

1907
02:28:20,320 --> 02:28:27,320
Big, huge, long story behind that, but long story short, he's got to do that tomorrow, too.

1908
02:28:27,320 --> 02:28:31,320
And so I've got a really long day with this date, and I really don't like this date at this point.

1909
02:28:31,320 --> 02:28:43,320
But other than that, and also, as I want to go mention, as you do, working on Friday, that sucks, but hey, I need the money.

1910
02:28:43,320 --> 02:28:48,320
And, yep, that's about it.

1911
02:28:48,320 --> 02:28:51,320
All right, let's move on to DDR Angel.

1912
02:28:54,320 --> 02:28:58,320
F you to school, just because I'm starting to hate my instructor more and more.

1913
02:28:58,320 --> 02:29:02,320
But hey, two more weeks left, then I don't have to deal with that to do it ever again.

1914
02:29:04,320 --> 02:29:10,320
F you to Andrew's motherboard being stupid because he can't get on the internet and play F11.

1915
02:29:10,320 --> 02:29:16,320
That was from him to the rest of, I don't know, his buddies I guess.

1916
02:29:16,320 --> 02:29:22,320
Tell him I got my first summon today, and I'm very excited. My summoner is level 20, heh heh heh.

1917
02:29:22,320 --> 02:29:24,320
Addict.

1918
02:29:24,320 --> 02:29:35,320
And, uh, F you to the party in F11 that I was in the other day, because I said I had to go and deal with real life issues, and they said, what's real life?

1919
02:29:35,320 --> 02:29:40,320
And I'm like, oooookay, buh bye, buh bye now, buh bye.

1920
02:29:40,320 --> 02:29:45,320
So just F you to that, because you guys are probably 13 and don't know any better, and don't have a life.

1921
02:29:45,320 --> 02:29:56,320
life. Like the rest of us. I have to get away and real life comes first. So I guess that's it. I'm not really here this week. I'm not writing to DMI.

1922
02:29:56,320 --> 02:30:12,320
That's fine. Actually, let's go over to explicit. Real quick before that, I was just reminded of something because it's like the channel here and right here. Happy birthday this week coming up to DDR Angel and to DDR Archaholic as well.

1923
02:30:12,320 --> 02:30:14,320
Very nice. Yes, that's right.

1924
02:30:14,320 --> 02:30:17,320
Speaking of which, um, who's throwing the party?

1925
02:30:17,320 --> 02:30:19,320
I thought there...

1926
02:30:19,320 --> 02:30:21,320
I thought I saw something on LiveJournal.

1927
02:30:21,320 --> 02:30:24,320
Oh, okay. We'll take... we'll take that discussion offline.

1928
02:30:24,320 --> 02:30:26,320
Meanwhile, explicit!

1929
02:30:26,320 --> 02:30:32,320
Well, I think that's the Thanksgiving, but I'll give an F-you to...

1930
02:30:32,320 --> 02:30:36,320
some asshole, um, hitting... opening the door...

1931
02:30:36,320 --> 02:30:40,320
Grab the mic by the bottom, because the cord's coming out a little bit, and it's... it's making it...

1932
02:30:40,320 --> 02:31:09,320
I'd like to say an f*** you to some a**hole who opened the door to some a**hole who opened the door off of a supermarket, slams my car, leaves a big mark,

1933
02:31:09,320 --> 02:31:14,320
Luckily I have his license plate number so I can go to the department and sue his ass.

1934
02:31:14,320 --> 02:31:19,320
If you're a webcam, I want to give him the middle finger.

1935
02:31:19,320 --> 02:31:21,320
Middle finger.

1936
02:31:21,320 --> 02:31:27,320
F.U. for the turkey for being so dry.

1937
02:31:27,320 --> 02:31:33,320
I think the turkey would say F.U. I'm dead.

1938
02:31:33,320 --> 02:31:35,320
Sorry.

1939
02:31:35,320 --> 02:31:36,980
Ah, that's okay. Sorry about that.

1940
02:31:36,980 --> 02:31:40,440
It has to be for Fry's for having a very fucking long line.

1941
02:31:40,440 --> 02:31:42,160
Oh, yeah.

1942
02:31:42,160 --> 02:31:44,560
I completely forgot about that.

1943
02:31:44,560 --> 02:31:49,600
Yeah, Fry's. So I get there, I go shopping on Black Friday for God knows what reason.

1944
02:31:49,600 --> 02:31:53,800
I just decided, gee, you know, I don't think I've been fucked up the ass enough this week.

1945
02:31:53,800 --> 02:31:55,240
Let's go to Fry's.

1946
02:31:55,240 --> 02:31:59,460
So I go to Fry's, and their line wraps around the whole fucking store.

1947
02:31:59,460 --> 02:32:01,640
It's just forever.

1948
02:32:01,640 --> 02:32:05,640
I like to walk in line, I'm like, I'm all, damn, this line keeps going!

1949
02:32:05,640 --> 02:32:10,640
Keep walking, keep walking, keep walking, see far off in the distance, in the horizon,

1950
02:32:10,640 --> 02:32:15,640
a woman with balloons that says, end of line, I'm like, ah, fuck it.

1951
02:32:15,640 --> 02:32:17,640
So then I had to make a judgment decision.

1952
02:32:17,640 --> 02:32:21,640
So I want to buy the stuff that I couldn't find anywhere else.

1953
02:32:21,640 --> 02:32:22,640
Or rent out the door.

1954
02:32:22,640 --> 02:32:23,640
Or leave.

1955
02:32:23,640 --> 02:32:28,640
Oh wait, if I leave, I have to wait in line to get out of the store, so, yeah, it fucking sucks.

1956
02:32:28,640 --> 02:32:37,640
Anyway, everything what Loki said, except that the register saying, sorry, we closed the line, thank you, goodbye, bye.

1957
02:32:37,640 --> 02:32:43,640
Just what I was about to buy in my $30 512 megabyte RAM.

1958
02:32:43,640 --> 02:32:44,640
I need RAM.

1959
02:32:44,640 --> 02:32:51,640
Now I have to spend 90 bucks or 120 just for it now, because it was a big ass sale at the time.

1960
02:32:51,640 --> 02:32:57,360
one for the damn price. And I feed the Texas Hold'em for giving me some very, very shitty

1961
02:32:57,360 --> 02:33:04,360
cards. Texas Hold'em Poker Set. Texas Hold'em Sacramento Chapter is coming soon from what

1962
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:15,000
I hear. No, it's more like Texas Fuck'em. How the hell can you win with three and two?

1963
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:22,000
2. That's nearly impossible. 3. Close? No. Every time I get a 3 or 2, um, no. Alright.

1964
02:33:23,540 --> 02:33:29,220
Three hour show. Three hour show guys. Wrap it up. Okay, okay, sorry, sorry. And FU4 losing

1965
02:33:29,220 --> 02:33:36,220
my 300 dollar, my very rare European watch, it's now gone, I don't wear it anymore. FU4

1966
02:33:37,800 --> 02:33:42,700
work for miscalculating my hours and money I've actually earned the whole two weeks.

1967
02:33:42,700 --> 02:33:47,700
Damn it, I wanted, I knew, I was like, $100 missing?

1968
02:33:47,700 --> 02:33:50,700
I'm like, what the fuck?

1969
02:33:50,700 --> 02:33:53,700
I'm not, I'm not gonna come around getting slave labor now.

1970
02:33:53,700 --> 02:33:56,700
Shit.

1971
02:33:56,700 --> 02:34:03,700
And after you to the family for making their whole Thanksgiving all anti-American.

1972
02:34:03,700 --> 02:34:07,700
Oh my, how, how, how do you make Thanksgiving anti-American?

1973
02:34:07,700 --> 02:34:09,700
Their American food was turkey.

1974
02:34:09,700 --> 02:34:21,060
Oh, I thought you meant like they were burning flags in the front yard or something.

1975
02:34:21,060 --> 02:34:22,060
Story time.

1976
02:34:22,060 --> 02:34:23,060
Islander's laughing.

1977
02:34:23,060 --> 02:34:24,060
What's up?

1978
02:34:24,060 --> 02:34:25,060
Story time.

1979
02:34:25,060 --> 02:34:26,060
Story time.

1980
02:34:26,060 --> 02:34:27,060
No, you have to tell her.

1981
02:34:27,060 --> 02:34:28,060
Yeah, you tell her.

1982
02:34:28,060 --> 02:34:29,060
I'm stopping the music.

1983
02:34:29,060 --> 02:34:30,060
I can't take Captain Jack anymore.

1984
02:34:30,060 --> 02:34:31,060
I'm sorry.

1985
02:34:31,060 --> 02:34:38,060
We're at Ross's sister's house, and she's talking about how she was talking to this

1986
02:34:38,060 --> 02:34:41,740
friend of hers, co-worker of hers, and she's like, oh, well, I don't know how to make green

1987
02:34:41,740 --> 02:34:47,220
mean casserole. Oh, wait, no, my, my, my little brother's girlfriend is going to be there.

1988
02:34:47,220 --> 02:34:56,540
She's white. She'll know how to make it. Since when is it a requirement of white people to

1989
02:34:56,540 --> 02:35:00,500
know how to make green mean casserole? I'm scared. Does that mean I have to be deported

1990
02:35:00,500 --> 02:35:13,700
because I don't know how to make casserole. I can make hot pockets. Does that count for

1991
02:35:13,700 --> 02:35:25,700
anything? A hot pocket? I eat a lot of pork and I like fried chicken. Can I join the club?

1992
02:35:25,700 --> 02:35:29,700
Anyway, explicit. Finish up your thought. We've got to get to the chat room if yous.

1993
02:35:29,700 --> 02:35:35,700
FU for people complaining about UltraMix 2 and yadda yadda butt stabs and such such such.

1994
02:35:35,700 --> 02:35:42,700
If you don't like those stabs, you can either edit the stabs by yourself, buy a memory card, or buy an Xbox edit.

1995
02:35:42,700 --> 02:35:46,700
I'm assuming that UltraMix 2 has edits to make, right?

1996
02:35:46,700 --> 02:35:47,700
Yes.

1997
02:35:47,700 --> 02:35:51,700
Okay. Or you can go to Stambidia and make your own shit. Plain and simple.

1998
02:35:51,700 --> 02:35:56,200
I'm sure Konami loves hearing that. Alright, alright, we gotta go to the chat room.

1999
02:35:56,200 --> 02:35:57,200
Okay, to be continued.

2000
02:35:57,200 --> 02:36:00,200
Alright, as usual, goody goody. Alright, let's bring the music back.

2001
02:36:03,200 --> 02:36:05,200
This is good chat room F.U. music.

2002
02:36:09,200 --> 02:36:14,200
Alright, Misty says two words, fuck bleeding.

2003
02:36:16,200 --> 02:36:17,200
Panda.

2004
02:36:17,200 --> 02:36:23,200
A-Men! A-Freaking-Men!

2005
02:36:23,200 --> 02:36:28,200
All the guys in the room just had the worst reaction to that. That was amazing.

2006
02:36:28,200 --> 02:36:33,200
Panda just said, F you to Comcast for not working most of the time.

2007
02:36:33,200 --> 02:36:37,200
F you to my mom's friend for what I think is more than just a friend.

2008
02:36:37,200 --> 02:36:40,200
And F you to life.

2009
02:36:40,200 --> 02:36:45,200
Snow Cat says, F you to broken teeth and having to go to the dentist in the morning. Cry.

2010
02:36:45,200 --> 02:36:53,200
MPQ says, Fuck Tekken 5 for being more important to local arcade goers than 2DX.

2011
02:36:53,200 --> 02:36:55,200
Well, it is pretty.

2012
02:36:55,200 --> 02:36:57,200
Pretty, but that's about it.

2013
02:36:57,200 --> 02:37:05,200
Illusion says, F you to my brother being a greedy bastard and not letting me use his Xbox to play Ultra Mix 2 more than a few days in a row.

2014
02:37:05,200 --> 02:37:09,200
Cause you need to fix everyday. Like heroin.

2015
02:37:09,200 --> 02:37:10,200
Like heroin.

2016
02:37:10,200 --> 02:37:12,200
Cap the vein, baby.

2017
02:37:12,200 --> 02:37:18,280
Elle mullet says f you in general to morons who complain about ultramix 2 for the most asinine reasons

2018
02:37:18,540 --> 02:37:22,780
Shut up about the timing windows guys. They don't matter. Just pick a song and have fun

2019
02:37:23,480 --> 02:37:25,120
Yeesh and

2020
02:37:25,120 --> 02:37:27,120
I quote yeesh

2021
02:37:32,120 --> 02:37:38,120
La la la anyway, sorry jaded 2004 says f you to Loki for singing Britney Spears

2022
02:37:38,120 --> 02:37:45,480
Britney Spears. Don't you be giving me the F.U. Blame Rob. They're the ones that said,

2023
02:37:45,480 --> 02:37:53,120
think Britney Spears. I didn't even want to play the game, okay? Love you, Loki. Jaded2004

2024
02:37:53,120 --> 02:37:59,520
also says, F.U. Michigan for having winters too cold. Legend of Zaku says, F.U. to Chartwells,

2025
02:37:59,520 --> 02:38:03,520
the food supplier for my campus, for making me gain 20 pounds. Yeah, because they forced

2026
02:38:03,520 --> 02:38:10,180
you to eat all that food if they forced you freshman 15 fu to my camera in my

2027
02:38:10,180 --> 02:38:15,240
case freshman 30 fu to my campus for giving me a shitty apartment that leaks

2028
02:38:15,240 --> 02:38:19,320
water from the ceilings when it rains heavily now there we go that's valid fu

2029
02:38:19,320 --> 02:38:23,720
to having to give up my PlayStation that so that it can be sent to Peru and fu to

2030
02:38:23,720 --> 02:38:27,840
my shitty stamina contributed to my weight problem for giving me more great

2031
02:38:27,840 --> 02:38:33,140
and not enough perfect I hear you on that one mjb says my f you the week

2032
02:38:33,140 --> 02:38:39,480
goes to my goddamn hair cutress I've never heard a hair cutress who cut my

2033
02:38:39,480 --> 02:38:44,160
hair extremely short after I repeatedly told her to only trim it and not to cut

2034
02:38:44,160 --> 02:38:47,440
it very much you goddamn bitch my friends don't even recognize me anymore

2035
02:38:47,440 --> 02:38:56,640
my hair is so short I hope you collapse you stupid bitch this says f you to

2036
02:38:56,640 --> 02:39:06,780
KONAMI for making Ultramix 2's doubles sucks, suck not sucks. I changed my FU to FU to everyone

2037
02:39:06,780 --> 02:39:10,400
at 8 on the break for being better than me and doing better in the tournament, being

2038
02:39:10,400 --> 02:39:16,120
better in the group. Don't send me a message that says I changed my FU because it doesn't

2039
02:39:16,120 --> 02:39:19,720
work because I read from the top down. So you think before you hit that enter key boys

2040
02:39:19,720 --> 02:39:26,720
and girls. DJ Rama S says, uh, I only, I only got two lines of his, something about having

2041
02:39:28,060 --> 02:39:35,060
the cash to pay for that damn cubic zirconia engagement ring. That's all I got. Flare Onee

2042
02:39:37,040 --> 02:39:44,040
says F you to Konami of Hawaii's obsession with the dancing character Lady. Where is

2043
02:40:14,040 --> 02:40:18,240
feel bad for him, but he might send it in and then we'll figure that out. He says he's

2044
02:40:18,240 --> 02:40:22,840
going to resend, so we'll see. If it's too long though, I'm cutting it short. Alright,

2045
02:40:22,840 --> 02:40:26,240
we're going to go to a break and when we come back, let's give away some Midihead CDs and

2046
02:40:26,240 --> 02:40:30,840
play some Midihead songs as well. I think that sounds like a plan. Yay! Yay! So let's

2047
02:40:30,840 --> 02:40:35,840
play some stuff from, I don't know, what sounds good to you guys. How about some popping?

2048
02:40:35,840 --> 02:40:42,520
Let's do some popping. I want to hear some Goonies. So we're going to do Goonies. We'll

2049
02:40:42,520 --> 02:40:49,520
We'll be back after this break.

2050
02:41:12,520 --> 02:41:14,520
Oh

2051
02:42:12,520 --> 02:42:14,520
Oh

2052
02:42:42,520 --> 02:42:48,520
I can't find out if you're in love

2053
02:42:56,520 --> 02:42:59,520
You don't have to believe in a heart of a doubt

2054
02:42:59,520 --> 02:43:02,520
But it's not what it's supposed to be

2055
02:43:02,520 --> 02:43:07,520
Still, I have to do something about this every morning

2056
02:43:07,520 --> 02:43:10,520
Still, I have to do something about this every morning

2057
02:43:10,520 --> 02:43:13,520
I want to be the only one with you

2058
02:43:13,520 --> 02:43:17,520
I like to be your friend tonight, tonight

2059
02:43:17,520 --> 02:43:20,520
I just want to be your little friend

2060
02:43:20,520 --> 02:43:23,520
Don't go away, there'll be no such thing

2061
02:43:23,520 --> 02:43:28,520
You will never stop me, okay?

2062
02:43:28,520 --> 02:43:31,520
You are a star

2063
02:43:31,520 --> 02:43:34,520
I want you to find me

2064
02:43:34,520 --> 02:43:36,520
I want you to find me

2065
02:43:36,520 --> 02:43:39,520
I want you to find me

2066
02:43:39,520 --> 02:43:43,820
Lookin' in the mirror, hiding underneath the wall

2067
02:43:43,820 --> 02:43:48,520
I wanna know how you feelin' when you see me grow

2068
02:43:48,520 --> 02:43:55,020
You tell me the lies, and the stories that leave me there for now

2069
02:43:55,020 --> 02:44:01,020
Now

2070
02:44:01,020 --> 02:44:28,020
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

2071
02:44:28,020 --> 02:44:38,620

2084
02:45:45,900 --> 02:45:51,900
at his site www.midihead.com and he's doing some download stuff so go, go beg, go beg

2085
02:45:51,900 --> 02:45:58,980
and plead and just prod around the site so. Alright, good job you guys. They're celebrating

2086
02:45:58,980 --> 02:46:03,460
in chat right now, they're both in chat, they're like yay! Alright, I'll be contacting you

2087
02:46:03,460 --> 02:46:06,420
guys, don't call us, we'll call you but I do need to get your addresses in a little

2088
02:46:06,420 --> 02:46:14,180
bit so we'll be contacting you shortly. Alright, let's see, how about some Ask Orange Lounge

2089
02:46:14,180 --> 02:46:17,860
you guys. We've got a little time here. We're going to open up the Skype line as well if

2090
02:46:17,860 --> 02:46:23,580
you guys want to call in over on www.orangelandradio.com. Click on interact with us. But first I have

2091
02:46:23,580 --> 02:46:29,420
to get some FUs of the week in, some that got forgotten there. Seagurd tried to send

2092
02:46:29,420 --> 02:46:34,180
me an FU of the week three times and I don't know why but it's broken. It didn't work right.

2093
02:46:34,180 --> 02:46:40,880
So it's broken. But he was just, he had some choice words for some of the people complaining

2094
02:46:40,880 --> 02:46:45,840
about the game he worked on. So let's just leave it at that.

2095
02:46:45,840 --> 02:46:49,880
I told him I would call him, but he doesn't want to.

2096
02:46:49,880 --> 02:46:54,640
He's shy. But DJ Rama S had another one. He said, a giant F.U. to that stupid bitch that

2097
02:46:54,640 --> 02:46:58,800
whined about the Black Friday sale. Another F.U. to the lady who called me lazy.

2098
02:46:58,800 --> 02:47:02,560
That's why I flipped you off in front of everyone there. And finally, a giant F.U.

2099
02:47:02,560 --> 02:47:05,520
to my former roommate for getting married. By the time I'm done with suing

2100
02:47:05,520 --> 02:47:07,240
your ass for throwing my shit out,

2101
02:47:07,240 --> 02:47:10,680
you won't have the cash to pay for that damn cubic zirconia engagement ring.

2102
02:47:10,680 --> 02:47:14,680
Okay, there we go. There we go. Okay, that was a ring. That makes sense.

2103
02:47:14,680 --> 02:47:18,680
Alright, good deal. Okay, so

2104
02:47:18,680 --> 02:47:22,680
if you guys have a question for Ask Orange Lounge, you can just send that on

2105
02:47:22,680 --> 02:47:26,680
in over private message to Sky right now. Let me just

2106
02:47:26,680 --> 02:47:30,680
type that in chat there. Or can you tell them how to send me a message if you wouldn't mind?

2107
02:47:30,680 --> 02:47:34,680
Okay. In case they don't know. Meanwhile,

2108
02:47:34,680 --> 02:47:38,680
we've got the theme music we've got to do here. And we're also going to

2109
02:47:38,680 --> 02:47:43,040
to take calls over skype for this as well if you guys want to call in our skype line

2110
02:47:43,040 --> 02:47:59,520
there. Type type type. Let's ask orange lounge some stupid question what will we find out

2111
02:47:59,520 --> 02:48:05,800
this week on orange lounge radio. One question I'd like to know is why is loki so bitter

2112
02:48:05,800 --> 02:48:09,240
He threw a fit, and now I'm afraid he's gonna kill me in my sleep.

2113
02:48:09,240 --> 02:48:09,740
YEE!

2114
02:48:15,340 --> 02:48:16,140
Alright.

2115
02:48:17,860 --> 02:48:23,540
First question for Ask Orange Lounge is, uh, actually we don't have any yet, because, uh, there's a delay, so,

2116
02:48:23,540 --> 02:48:27,660
and I forgot to announce this before the previous break, so we don't have any questions over private message just yet.

2117
02:48:27,980 --> 02:48:31,360
So I was gonna open it up if anybody else had any questions for anyone else.

2118
02:48:34,040 --> 02:48:35,280
Anything? Anything?

2119
02:48:35,280 --> 02:48:47,080
Why the F are you, did you just come over here if you're just going to play DS all night?

2120
02:48:47,080 --> 02:48:49,600
I'm fully paying attention, Mr. Mann.

2121
02:48:49,600 --> 02:48:52,480
I'm just teasing, I'm giving you a hard time.

2122
02:48:52,480 --> 02:48:53,480
Where have you been?

2123
02:48:53,480 --> 02:48:54,480
Just busy with school and stuff?

2124
02:48:54,480 --> 02:49:01,480
Busy with school and couldn't get rides and stuff so, you know, stuff happens.

2125
02:49:01,480 --> 02:49:09,480
But I'm here this week and hopefully I can come the next couple weeks and there will be just like old times.

2126
02:49:31,480 --> 02:49:34,960
but I think he said he was on the East Coast. Because your state has it out for you.

2127
02:49:34,960 --> 02:49:39,000
Oh, he says Washington, Washington.

2128
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:42,320
Isn't Washington where GameWorks is and all those Seattle

2129
02:49:42,320 --> 02:49:46,880
people that have a lot of good stuff up there? Maybe he doesn't live near there, I don't know.

2130
02:49:46,880 --> 02:49:50,360
Well, here's the blanket answer for that question. If you think the

2131
02:49:50,360 --> 02:49:54,120
state of Bemani sucks in your state, buy the home mixes.

2132
02:49:54,120 --> 02:49:56,940
Okay, there's one option. You know, they put those out for a reason so you can play in the

2133
02:49:56,940 --> 02:49:57,680
comfort of your own

2134
02:49:57,680 --> 02:50:01,800
own home. If you still don't like it, get some of your friends together, professionally

2135
02:50:01,800 --> 02:50:02,560
approach

2136
02:50:02,560 --> 02:50:06,560
the management at your local arcade and say, hey, we've got an idea for a game that

2137
02:50:06,560 --> 02:50:08,240
would bring you guys money

2138
02:50:08,240 --> 02:50:11,480
and emphasize money and

2139
02:50:11,480 --> 02:50:14,760
visiting frequently. So if you don't like the situation

2140
02:50:14,760 --> 02:50:18,320
you can take control in your own hands and do something about it.

2141
02:50:18,320 --> 02:50:22,120
Just a thought for you guys.

2142
02:50:22,120 --> 02:50:27,760
Let's see, Flaronay says, are you guys going to be on Xbox Live tonight?

2143
02:50:27,760 --> 02:50:33,120
I may sneak on after, right after the show, because you guys still need to see Ultramix 2, right?

2144
02:50:33,120 --> 02:50:39,120
Yeah. Okay, we're going to put it, we'll sneak on there after the show a little bit, maybe.

2145
02:50:39,120 --> 02:50:41,320
So you might see us on there for a little bit, Flaronay, look for us.

2146
02:50:41,320 --> 02:50:44,720
He knows the secret way to find us on Xbox Live.

2147
02:50:44,720 --> 02:50:47,920
Dark Knight says, what are your guys' Christmas wishes this year?

2148
02:50:47,920 --> 02:50:51,320
Anybody care to answer a Christmas wish?

2149
02:50:51,320 --> 02:50:54,520
I wish for world peace.

2150
02:50:54,520 --> 02:50:55,680
I need no clothes.

2151
02:50:55,680 --> 02:50:56,680
I want to get laid.

2152
02:50:56,680 --> 02:50:57,680
Just kidding.

2153
02:50:57,680 --> 02:51:05,560
No, uh, my Christmas wish is just, um, I would like to just have enough time to hang out

2154
02:51:05,560 --> 02:51:06,560
with all my friends.

2155
02:51:06,560 --> 02:51:07,560
I want a lot of parties.

2156
02:51:07,560 --> 02:51:09,080
I want a lot of holiday parties.

2157
02:51:09,080 --> 02:51:10,080
That's my Christmas wish.

2158
02:51:10,080 --> 02:51:11,080
I want holiday parties.

2159
02:51:11,080 --> 02:51:14,000
And that can be Christmas, New Year's, and year round, really.

2160
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:15,720
Just throw parties all year round.

2161
02:51:15,720 --> 02:51:16,720
That's great.

2162
02:51:16,720 --> 02:51:18,920
Angel, did you have something you want to add to that, your Christmas wish?

2163
02:51:18,920 --> 02:51:19,920
I got mine.

2164
02:51:19,920 --> 02:51:21,920
Oh, what's that?

2165
02:51:21,920 --> 02:51:25,920
Uh, DS, but, uh, I already got it, and...

2166
02:51:25,920 --> 02:51:29,920
Well, I don't really know what I want besides, uh,

2167
02:51:29,920 --> 02:51:33,920
the Karaoke Revolution 2 and 3, which I haven't gotten yet,

2168
02:51:33,920 --> 02:51:35,920
and, uh, Officer Mix 2.

2169
02:51:35,920 --> 02:51:39,920
Uh, the rest has to come later, because it's more expensive,

2170
02:51:39,920 --> 02:51:42,920
like, uh, Ace Style and, uh, 10.

2171
02:51:42,920 --> 02:51:46,920
I know. Yeah, I do really want Ace Style and Poppin' 10.

2172
02:51:46,920 --> 02:51:48,920
It's just gonna be a little while there, so...

2173
02:51:48,920 --> 02:51:52,340

02:52:15,140 --> 02:52:22,500
Christmas wish all right we have a question from illusion this is great

2178
02:52:22,500 --> 02:52:28,320
listen to this one how do you deal with secret sweet ass ever anytime he comes

2179
02:52:28,320 --> 02:52:36,720
on is it hard keeping your hands off of it well um you know what secrets just a

2180
02:52:36,720 --> 02:52:49,240
friend. You know he's just a friend. Oh baby you got what I need. Would you want to grab

2181
02:52:49,240 --> 02:52:57,140
your brother's sweet ass? No. You may if you live in Alabama. I don't have these sweet

2182
02:52:57,140 --> 02:53:02,120
ass feelings towards Sigurd. Do you have sweet ass Sigurd feelings going on girl? I don't.

2183
02:53:02,120 --> 02:53:06,700
I'm sorry. I know that's gonna, you know, be heartbreaking for him, but I don't.

2184
02:53:06,700 --> 02:53:08,920
Yeah. Islander? Never have.

2185
02:53:08,920 --> 02:53:13,320
Loki, how do you resist secret sweet ass? Quite easily, I'm straight.

2186
02:53:13,320 --> 02:53:18,800
Alright, moving on.

2187
02:53:18,800 --> 02:53:24,000
DJ Rama S says, do you guys want a holiday card for me?

2188
02:53:24,000 --> 02:53:28,280
Certainly, of course we want a holiday. We'll put it up on our wall.

2189
02:53:28,280 --> 02:53:34,280
We have a little wall here. Well, we can't put it with the autographs, but maybe we'll start another wall for holiday wishes.

2190
02:53:34,280 --> 02:53:39,280
But then again, I don't want to give out my address, so we'll see. Maybe we can do something. We'll see.

2191
02:53:39,280 --> 02:53:42,280
Like a P.O. Box, maybe.

2192
02:53:42,280 --> 02:53:48,280
That's funny. The In My Eyes remix of the long one is actually Midi Head's super long mix.

2193
02:53:48,280 --> 02:53:53,280
Yeah, on the V-Rare, it says super long on the V-Rare.

2194
02:53:53,280 --> 02:53:56,280
Hello, where were you two weeks ago?

2195
02:53:56,280 --> 02:53:59,860
Legend of Zaku says, you're on that DDR diet, right?

2196
02:53:59,860 --> 02:54:02,500
I need help planning a regimen for dropping 20 pounds,

2197
02:54:02,500 --> 02:54:05,580
AKA what songs and or oni choruses must I do to really

2198
02:54:05,580 --> 02:54:07,300
start shedding weight?

2199
02:54:07,300 --> 02:54:08,720
OK, here's my honest answer to the question.

2200
02:54:08,720 --> 02:54:11,500
There's really no set songs or choruses to do.

2201
02:54:11,500 --> 02:54:13,620
There's no super weight loss plan.

2202
02:54:13,620 --> 02:54:15,820
My suggestion is if you're going to play non-stops, play

2203
02:54:15,820 --> 02:54:16,660
the long ones.

2204
02:54:16,660 --> 02:54:19,180
Play 7 to 10, because the more you take breaks in between

2205
02:54:19,180 --> 02:54:21,820
songs, the less your cardio's going to go.

2206
02:54:21,820 --> 02:54:26,500
The main thing is cardio. You want to focus on doing at least a good 20 minutes of non-stop

2207
02:54:26,500 --> 02:54:32,980
cardio. Even if that means doing something as simple as just a basic endless. Even then

2208
02:54:32,980 --> 02:54:42,200
you're going to be burning enough calories and getting rid of some of that excess. Try

2209
02:54:42,200 --> 02:54:47,700
to keep the breaks as small as possible. Don't do too much. Don't overdo it.

2210
02:54:47,700 --> 02:54:53,380
I am on the DDR diet and to an extent I'm all for the fact that you know DDR can help

2211
02:54:53,380 --> 02:54:59,480
you lose weight but honestly you've got to do it I think really to make it really successful

2212
02:54:59,480 --> 02:55:04,280
you got to do it with other stuff stop drinking soda if you're drinking soda that was my honestly

2213
02:55:04,280 --> 02:55:09,120
that was really how I lost a lot of my weight stop drinking soda drink a lot of water sit-ups

2214
02:55:09,120 --> 02:55:14,840
push-ups that kind of stuff can help you out too that would be my suggestion if you really

2215
02:55:14,840 --> 02:55:19,400
want more exercise because DDR it works, it gives you a really good workout but you know

2216
02:55:19,400 --> 02:55:22,320
I think you can enhance it, you can make it better by doing other little things too.

2217
02:55:22,320 --> 02:55:28,080
Buy like a little set of those mini five pound hand weights or something like that and workout

2218
02:55:28,080 --> 02:55:29,080
with those.

2219
02:55:29,080 --> 02:55:30,080
Alright.

2220
02:55:30,080 --> 02:55:37,160
If you have a max 2 I'll play a pop 8.

2221
02:55:37,160 --> 02:55:42,020
Dojo Max says when will DDR max 3 come out?

2222
02:55:42,020 --> 02:55:47,060
I heard Naoki is producing it in a secret basement, is this true?

2223
02:55:47,060 --> 02:55:50,540
Chances are no, that's not true. We would probably...

2224
02:55:50,540 --> 02:55:56,460
Don't believe anything unless we report it. No. Unless Konami's official site says something,

2225
02:55:56,460 --> 02:56:00,780
there's really nothing you can do. It's all speculation.

2226
02:56:00,780 --> 02:56:04,740
And I do think if a new DDR at this point comes out, it's not going to be called Max 3.

2227
02:56:04,740 --> 02:56:06,140
It will be called something else.

2228
02:56:06,140 --> 02:56:10,020
Because Max 3 was extreme. I don't know if you missed DDR extreme, but...

2229
02:56:10,020 --> 02:56:15,780
I think if they do do a new DDR, honestly, here's my suggestion, and Konami, if you're

2230
02:56:15,780 --> 02:56:18,300
listening, feel free to take this.

2231
02:56:18,300 --> 02:56:21,740
If you're going to do a new DDR, you're going to do a new hardware thing, right, and you're

2232
02:56:21,740 --> 02:56:25,060
probably going to spice it up a little bit, make it a little more like 2DX, like bigger,

2233
02:56:25,060 --> 02:56:26,800
badder, better thing, right?

2234
02:56:26,800 --> 02:56:28,260
Here's my suggestion.

2235
02:56:28,260 --> 02:56:35,380
Dance Dance Revolution 2.

2236
02:56:35,380 --> 02:56:36,380
It's as simple as that.

2237
02:56:36,380 --> 02:56:39,140
Wow, interesting name.

2238
02:56:39,140 --> 02:56:44,300
Dance Dance Revolution 2. Question on behalf of Dark Child through DD

2239
02:56:44,300 --> 02:56:47,360
Archaholic and this will be the last question for tonight you guys. If Dark

2240
02:56:47,360 --> 02:56:54,960
Child was gay would Sky sleep with him? No. Alright that's gonna do it for Ask

2241
02:56:54,960 --> 02:56:59,420
Orange Lounge tonight. Thank you guys very much for your questions tonight and

2242
02:56:59,420 --> 02:57:03,980
participating. Now we're gonna go around and get everybody's final thought but

2243
02:57:03,980 --> 02:57:07,080
not before we get in a plug for the rest of the week's programming. Monday night

2244
02:57:07,080 --> 02:57:11,680
Tune in to Diversion, the Orange Lounge Radio remix show, right here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2245
02:57:11,680 --> 02:57:16,520
All your favorite Bamani remixes, official fan-made ones, and yes, remixes done in acid

2246
02:57:16,520 --> 02:57:17,520
are okay.

2247
02:57:17,520 --> 02:57:18,520
Yay!

2248
02:57:18,520 --> 02:57:19,520
Tuesday night, Dark Sakura.

2249
02:57:19,520 --> 02:57:22,040
I do believe she's back this Tuesday and she's gonna be doing...

2250
02:57:22,040 --> 02:57:24,640
She's not gonna be back until way late though.

2251
02:57:24,640 --> 02:57:28,740
So it'll be a re-run of Pump Up the Volume, ready to go.

2252
02:57:28,740 --> 02:57:31,700
So likely we're gonna get a re-run of Pump Up the Volume, but it's a good show and you

2253
02:57:31,700 --> 02:57:35,560
should tune in, you know, and check out what it's all about if you haven't listened before,

2254
02:57:35,560 --> 02:57:40,900
because it'll be new to you. So Tuesday nights, about 730, pump up volume. Thursday nights,

2255
02:57:40,900 --> 02:57:44,180
I'm sorry, Wednesday nights are the classic episodes of Orange Lawns Radio. Thursday nights,

2256
02:57:44,180 --> 02:57:48,140
myself, Rice Princess and Lanky Style, we're back from our Thanksgiving holiday this week

2257
02:57:48,140 --> 02:57:52,700
with Outside the Box, all that other video gaming chat that doesn't quite fit into the

2258
02:57:52,700 --> 02:57:58,580
Bomani spectrum. And then Friday night over on The Freak, or DDR Freak Radio, Orange Lawns

2259
02:57:58,580 --> 02:58:03,900
Radio Rewind. Hear the same shit over again, but it's just as good the second time, you

2260
02:58:03,900 --> 02:58:05,900
Especially when you missed some of it.

2261
02:58:05,900 --> 02:58:07,900
That spilling tastes great.

2262
02:58:07,900 --> 02:58:09,900
Alright, so that's it for the programming.

2263
02:58:09,900 --> 02:58:12,900
And now, we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought.

2264
02:58:12,900 --> 02:58:15,900
We'll start with Islander, because he has a microphone over there.

2265
02:58:15,900 --> 02:58:18,900
Ah, final thought.

2266
02:58:18,900 --> 02:58:21,900
Quit your bitching and just accept it.

2267
02:58:21,900 --> 02:58:22,900
Thank you.

2268
02:58:22,900 --> 02:58:24,900
Very stern.

2269
02:58:24,900 --> 02:58:27,900
Angel, your final thought.

2270
02:58:27,900 --> 02:58:29,900
Mario sucks!

2271
02:58:29,900 --> 02:58:31,900
No, just kidding.

2272
02:58:31,900 --> 02:58:37,900
I really want to know what's wrong with my car, please.

2273
02:58:37,900 --> 02:58:40,900
Exquisite.

2274
02:58:40,900 --> 02:58:50,900
Stupid drivers must get the actual driver's how to drive. God motherfucking damn it.

2275
02:58:50,900 --> 02:58:52,900
Loki, your final thought?

2276
02:59:20,900 --> 02:59:25,900
After the credits, because we're going to be playing that other Midihead song, so if you liked that last one, you've got to check out this other new one.

2277
02:59:25,900 --> 02:59:30,900
It's an unreleased track, I believe. It's called Deeper and Deeper. That's what we're going to be hearing after the show.

2278
02:59:30,900 --> 02:59:39,900
I'd like to mention that that track is inside the little special members area if you purchased an album.

2279
02:59:39,900 --> 02:59:41,900
Well, hell, there you go.

2280
02:59:41,900 --> 02:59:45,900
Alright, so have a great night, everybody. Thank you very much for listening.

2281
02:59:45,900 --> 02:59:50,100
listening. The Fortune Cookie message is an oldie but goodie tonight because I didn't

2282
02:59:50,100 --> 02:59:53,300
get a new one from Dark Sakura, unfortunately. But this is a good one, so you guys will enjoy

2283
02:59:53,300 --> 02:59:59,780
tonight's Fortune Cookie message. The final word of the show goes to... Islander. One

2284
02:59:59,780 --> 03:00:10,340
word. Sum it all up. Ergasmic. That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio

2285
03:00:10,340 --> 03:00:17,580
Live. Orange Lounge Radio Live is an Orange Lounge Radio production. For more information

2287
03:00:28,060 --> 03:00:31,060
of the day.

2288
03:00:31,060 --> 03:00:39,060
Hey folks, this was CJ Radio presenting you Captain Jack's Greatest Summer Heads.

2289
03:00:39,060 --> 03:00:46,060
Keep the spirit, the sun is shining wherever you are, and don't forget, copy kills music.

2290
03:00:46,060 --> 03:00:49,060
So, don't copy, buy our records.

2291
03:00:49,060 --> 03:00:52,060
Bye-bye, the party never ends.

2292
03:00:52,060 --> 03:00:59,620
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
