Just kidding, Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that. In this episode...

01:48.520 --> 01:59.020
We are live, and this is episode number 118 for this, November the 14th of 2004.

01:59.020 --> 02:06.680
You're tuned in to the internet's most fascinating radio station of all things, be money.

02:06.680 --> 02:07.680
My name is Rob Roberts.

02:07.680 --> 02:08.680
You might know me as Sky.

02:08.680 --> 02:12.860
Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts in that corner, the angriest bunny on the

02:12.860 --> 02:13.860
farm.

02:13.860 --> 02:14.860
Say hello to Miss Jamie.

02:14.860 --> 02:16.380
Some reason you'll know her better as Dark Sagaroth.

02:16.380 --> 02:19.820
I hate my allergies and want them to die.

02:19.820 --> 02:20.700
Fair enough.

02:20.700 --> 02:23.460
Also joining us tonight by the other

02:23.460 --> 02:25.460
awesome co-host we have here

02:25.460 --> 02:30.740
our tech master, Loki, I'm rolling.

02:30.740 --> 02:32.780
Yes, if you want to know why our webcam isn't up yet

02:32.780 --> 02:34.760
and why we don't have the

02:34.760 --> 02:37.800
dark sacra in our chat room yet over at orangehonser.com

02:37.800 --> 02:39.160
that's because

02:39.160 --> 02:40.820
we're having an emergency

02:40.820 --> 02:43.020
Katamari Damacy

02:43.020 --> 02:44.220
marathon.

02:44.220 --> 02:46.220
Maybe Jamie will tell us about why we have to do that in a little bit.

02:46.220 --> 02:47.820
But I do want to introduce our other guest for tonight.

02:47.820 --> 02:51.020
We have a very special guest joining us for the second week in a row.

02:51.020 --> 02:52.820
A lovely surprise. He's in town tonight.

02:52.820 --> 02:54.320
Say hello to Floatwalk.

02:54.320 --> 02:56.220
Whoo! Personal record for me.

02:56.220 --> 02:57.920
That's right. Two in a row.

02:57.920 --> 03:01.120
If you made it next week, you'd have tic-tac-toe.

03:01.120 --> 03:03.320
Wow. And three is a magic number.

03:03.320 --> 03:04.720
It sure is.

03:04.720 --> 03:05.520
All right.

03:05.520 --> 03:09.220
So, Jamie, really fast before we go to the opening break here.

03:09.220 --> 03:12.820
Why is Loki having to play Katamari Damacy right now?

03:12.820 --> 03:14.120
It's so big.

03:14.120 --> 03:24.560
Oh, um, because I can only get up to, I've only done the level twice, 256 meters on the

03:24.560 --> 03:29.360
Make the Moon level, and he's got just up to 744, which is awesome.

03:29.360 --> 03:30.360
Wow.

03:30.360 --> 03:31.360
It's so big.

03:31.360 --> 03:37.520
Yeah, so that's the only time Lokis are going to hear that in his life, but that's right.

03:37.520 --> 03:42.200
Alright, we're going to wrap up Katamari Damacy and put it on the webcam and all that stuff,

03:42.200 --> 03:46.160
So visit OrangeLoungeRadio.com, our website for all the webcam details and stuff.

03:46.160 --> 03:49.760
Tonight we have a lot of special stuff for you during the music break.

03:49.760 --> 03:53.680
The Ultramix 2 website went up earlier this week, we're going to be talking about that

03:53.680 --> 03:57.800
in a little while, but because of that, we got a lot of spoiled fun!

03:57.800 --> 03:58.800
Yay, spoilers!

03:58.800 --> 03:59.800
My favorite.

03:59.800 --> 04:04.300
Wow, just take the fun away from us Vivids while we still have them.

04:04.300 --> 04:05.300
You know what?

04:05.300 --> 04:09.560
You guys quit like three weeks ago, so as far as I'm concerned, you're done.

04:09.560 --> 04:10.560
We're done with you.

04:10.560 --> 04:11.560
No, I'm kidding.

04:11.560 --> 04:14.960

04:14.960 --> 04:19.560

04:19.560 --> 04:23.840
songs we just we went out there on the internet and everywhere we looked we

04:23.840 --> 04:27.600

04:27.600 --> 04:30.740
these songs as you could find for you guys to play so we're gonna play them

04:30.740 --> 04:34.160

05:24.920 --> 05:33.920
Sometimes it's bad, things get bad And I'm not, whoever you are

05:33.920 --> 05:39.920
There is light, by my side I feel alright

05:39.920 --> 05:42.920
Cause our love is me

05:42.920 --> 05:46.920
Feel them, the two of us

05:46.920 --> 05:49.920
The earth cannot describe

05:49.920 --> 05:54.920
How I miss you so much

05:54.920 --> 05:58.920
La, la la la, la la la

05:58.920 --> 06:02.920
La la la, la la la

06:02.920 --> 06:06.920
La la la, la la la

06:06.920 --> 06:08.920
La-la-la

06:15.920 --> 06:18.920
La-la-la-la-la

06:23.920 --> 06:25.920
You make me high

06:25.920 --> 06:27.920
I can fly

06:27.920 --> 06:29.920
Touch the sky

06:29.920 --> 06:31.920
Wherever you are

06:31.920 --> 06:32.920
I feel free

06:32.920 --> 06:34.920
In ecstasy

06:34.920 --> 06:36.920
You and me

06:36.920 --> 06:39.920
You can take my day

06:39.920 --> 06:41.920
Keep away

06:41.920 --> 06:43.920
And you'll stay

06:43.920 --> 06:44.920
Wherever you are

06:44.920 --> 06:46.920
In my heart

06:46.920 --> 06:48.920
From the start

06:48.920 --> 06:50.920
You'll never fall

06:50.920 --> 06:54.920
Because our love is real

06:54.920 --> 06:56.920
Visuals and looks

06:56.920 --> 06:57.920
Two of us

06:57.920 --> 07:01.920
And words cannot describe

07:01.920 --> 07:03.920
How I miss you

07:03.920 --> 07:11.920
Oh my, I feel love in your eyes

07:11.920 --> 07:18.920
And I feel love when I'm with you

07:18.920 --> 07:25.920
I feel love in your eyes

07:25.920 --> 07:30.920
Whatever you may be

07:34.920 --> 07:36.920
When I feel blue

07:36.920 --> 07:38.920
I think of you

07:38.920 --> 07:40.920
But you're true

07:40.920 --> 07:41.920
Wherever you are

07:41.920 --> 07:43.920
We won't fall

07:43.920 --> 07:45.920
You still are

07:45.920 --> 07:47.920
The shining star

07:48.920 --> 07:50.920
Sometimes it's bad

07:50.920 --> 07:52.920
Things get bad

07:52.920 --> 07:54.920
And I'm sad

07:54.920 --> 08:02.120
Wherever you are, there is light By my side, I feel all right

08:24.920 --> 08:45.920
Gaming Radio, so uncensored, that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

08:45.920 --> 08:47.920
Moo-chah-moo-kaw-key.

08:47.920 --> 08:50.920
Orange Lounge Radio.

08:50.920 --> 08:54.920
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

08:54.920 --> 08:58.920
Turn off that Katamari game already.

08:58.920 --> 09:02.920
That's so last month.

09:02.920 --> 09:06.920
Get in the now. No, I know. I'm kidding.

09:06.920 --> 09:10.920
Now apparently Float Walk was impressed because Loki knew about a hidden

09:10.920 --> 09:14.920
game during the credits. Tell us about what's going on there.

09:14.920 --> 09:18.920
Because I unfortunately did not really get into Katamari. I got to like the second stage and then

09:18.920 --> 09:26.920
Well, apparently at the end, you see the credits roll and you have a song and you see your little guy running around with the ball.

09:26.920 --> 09:30.920
You can actually move the analog sticks around and you can pick up countries.

09:30.920 --> 09:35.920
And so you see a list of countries. You see, you picked up Korea, you picked up Vietnam, all that stuff.

09:35.920 --> 09:45.920
I'm sitting here thinking, wow, I haven't seen so many of those countries since Animaniacs when, what was it, Yaqui did United States, Canada, Mexico, Panama, Haiti, Jamaica, Peru, you know.

09:45.920 --> 09:50.920
I just wanted you to sing that song on air because that made me giggle during the break.

09:50.920 --> 09:55.920
Alright. Well good. So we made the moon for Jamie.

09:55.920 --> 10:00.920
Good. Now she can't say that we don't do things for her

10:00.920 --> 10:05.920
on this show because we make the moon for her.

10:05.920 --> 10:10.920
We gave her the moon to stars and to sky. We swear.

10:10.920 --> 10:14.360
I had to go there.

10:14.360 --> 10:19.000
If that was a thread, I would lock it.

10:19.000 --> 10:25.160
Jamie's in the potty right now, so we can't do How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day.

10:25.160 --> 10:28.440
She's on her way out, but I'll take a minute to do some announcements.

10:28.440 --> 10:33.840
By the way, folks, this is very interesting. Here in the Orange Lounge

10:33.840 --> 10:34.640
Radio Studio,

10:34.640 --> 10:38.240
the bathroom door, the lock is broken.

10:38.240 --> 10:40.240
I was wondering what the hell was up with that.

10:40.240 --> 10:43.440
At any time, somebody could barge in there while you're trying to tinkle.

10:43.440 --> 10:45.600
So please be careful.

10:45.600 --> 10:46.600
Here's the rule.

10:46.600 --> 10:50.920
If the light is on and the fan is running, don't come a-knockin'.

10:50.920 --> 10:53.520
All right.

10:53.520 --> 10:55.720
I couldn't come up with a rhyme for that.

10:55.720 --> 10:56.720
Sorry.

10:56.720 --> 10:59.120
If the fan is running, you better start running.

10:59.120 --> 11:00.360
I think your mic ain't on there.

11:00.360 --> 11:01.360
Try it again.

11:01.360 --> 11:04.240
If the fan is running, you better start running because you never know what they're doing

11:04.240 --> 11:05.240
in there.

11:05.240 --> 11:06.240
Exactly.

11:06.240 --> 11:07.240
Something like that.

11:07.240 --> 11:08.240
Anyway.

11:08.240 --> 11:09.240
Oh, yeah.

11:09.240 --> 11:13.520
Did you hear, maybe we've mentioned it a couple times, that we're going to be doing a really

11:13.520 --> 11:17.120
big giveaway here on OrangeLawnsRadio and I'm not talking about, you know, no small

11:17.120 --> 11:20.360
time little, you know, yada yada giveaway.

11:20.360 --> 11:23.080
We're talking really big news here.

11:23.080 --> 11:28.000
We are giving away, in conjunction with ddrspot.com, that's kind of why Floatwalk's here tonight

11:28.000 --> 11:34.580
because he's a big part of the DDR Spot community, OrangeLawnsRadio in conjunction with ddrspot.com

11:34.580 --> 11:38.900
is giving away signed Akira Yomoka CDs.

11:38.900 --> 11:42.220
cool we're gonna be giving away two of them so the contest is gonna go for two

11:42.220 --> 11:46.260
weeks now here's the thing though we changed the rules a little bit from what

11:46.260 --> 11:49.640
we talked about last week and I yeah because we can't basically is what it

11:49.640 --> 11:52.820
boils down to now and I know you love it when you hear that we change the rules

11:52.820 --> 11:57.380
but no actually we did it to make the contest easier for you so here's the

11:57.380 --> 12:01.820
deal now forget what I said previously about how it's gonna work well how it's

12:01.820 --> 12:04.380
gonna work now is that you know we have spin-off shows here on orange launch

12:04.380 --> 12:08.180
radio every Monday night diversion yours laundry a remix show every Tuesday night

12:08.180 --> 12:12.180
Pump Up the Volume with Dark Sagra, and every Thursday night, Outside the Box with yours truly.

12:12.180 --> 12:17.180
All of which are on at 7, although Pump Up the Volume technically starts at 7.30.

12:17.180 --> 12:24.180
You gotta listen to those spin-off shows, and during the show at any time, we're gonna ask a trivia question about Akira Yomoka,

12:24.180 --> 12:29.180
or it could be about something Akira Yomoka was involved with, such as Silent Hill series would be a great one.

12:29.180 --> 12:33.180
We're gonna ask a trivia question. If you know the answer to the trivia question,

12:33.180 --> 12:39.180
send an email to akira at orange lounge radio dot com and you will be entered into the contest.

12:39.180 --> 12:43.180
That's the change. You don't have to listen all three nights to be entered.

12:43.180 --> 12:48.180
But what the change does allow us to do is that if you do listen all three nights

12:48.180 --> 12:53.180
and you send us three emails with three different answers, you'll be entered in the contest three times.

12:53.180 --> 12:58.180
So you have three times the chance of somebody else if you listen all week long.

12:58.180 --> 13:02.300
But if you have a busy schedule and you can only listen one night, you can still get one

13:02.300 --> 13:03.760
entry into the contest.

13:03.760 --> 13:11.820
So the contest starts tomorrow on the 15th, and it's going to run through the 20, it looks

13:11.820 --> 13:16.620
like the last entry chance to be on the 25th, Thanksgiving, how appropriate.

13:16.620 --> 13:21.020
Thanksgiving Day will be your last chance to enter, so look for that.

13:21.020 --> 13:25.540
Alright, so I just wanted to kind of get that out there, talk about the Kiriyomuoka contest.

13:25.540 --> 13:29.940
I also have another big announcement about the show, but let's wait till we get after

13:29.940 --> 13:33.640
How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day, because DDR Spot is not the only big Bomani site we're

13:33.640 --> 13:34.740
working with.

13:34.740 --> 13:40.460
We have another big, I know, I know, but basically, I think we all feel we're gonna whore ourselves

13:40.460 --> 13:42.860
anywhere that'll pay for it, so, or not, even though...

13:42.860 --> 13:45.240
So who is this third party in the whole menage?

13:45.240 --> 13:49.340
I'm gonna tell ya, I'm gonna tell ya, as soon as we finish this segment here, with

13:49.340 --> 13:52.180
How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day, some folks already know, some folks have already

13:52.180 --> 13:57.820
figured it out, but we will tell you officially what's going on in a minute.

13:57.820 --> 14:00.580
As I said, we've got to start off every week's show with a little bit of how was your week,

14:00.580 --> 14:04.920
how was your day, and of course the lovely Dark Sakura, starting us off as always.

14:04.920 --> 14:13.340
My week was insanely busy, just school everything, and then today my allergies have been killing

14:13.340 --> 14:14.340
me all day.

14:14.340 --> 14:20.580
It's been trying to not get sick and everyone's getting sick around me, but I'm hoping that

14:20.580 --> 14:26.260
running away to Alabama in a another week I'll be escaping the whole thing so

14:26.260 --> 14:37.220
um but apart from that I really didn't do a whole bunch of anything um dot dot

14:37.220 --> 14:43.620
dot as really it's really been nothing but that school and hanging out and just

14:43.620 --> 14:50.220
the same little crap I normally do so now as for Rob's week first he went on

14:50.220 --> 14:54.460
on an expedition to Alaska, where the Eskimos kidnapped him

14:54.460 --> 14:55.460
and made him their king.

14:55.460 --> 14:58.100
Stop telling lies while I'm out of the room.

14:58.100 --> 14:59.940
Although, that did happen, actually.

14:59.940 --> 15:01.380
It was three weeks ago, not last week.

15:01.380 --> 15:01.900
Oh, my bad.

15:01.900 --> 15:02.980
Yeah, your bad.

15:02.980 --> 15:04.580
Oh, anyway, sorry.

15:04.580 --> 15:08.740
I had to check on my laundry, because when Jamie comes over,

15:08.740 --> 15:10.840
she likes to not only do orange laundry.

15:10.840 --> 15:12.820
This is how we pay Jamie for doing the show,

15:12.820 --> 15:15.460
since we don't have money to exactly give out to people.

15:15.460 --> 15:18.580
We pay in laundry, in clean laundry.

15:18.580 --> 15:20.580
That way I don't have to use our...

15:20.580 --> 15:22.580
Hey, that's worth a lot of quarters for the arcade.

15:22.580 --> 15:24.580
...orange lounge.

15:24.580 --> 15:26.580
All right.

15:26.580 --> 15:28.580
And I'll pay you back in... in... sinus school.

15:28.580 --> 15:30.580
Uh-huh, hooray.

15:30.580 --> 15:32.580
Just what I always wanted.

15:32.580 --> 15:34.580
All right, uh, see, that's it?

15:34.580 --> 15:36.580
My week was boring.

15:36.580 --> 15:38.580
Well, then, what's up with that? Like, the past two weeks you've been boring.

15:38.580 --> 15:40.580
I've been training people.

15:40.580 --> 15:42.580
The past two weeks.

15:42.580 --> 15:44.580
All right. Well, I train people too. That's my job.

15:44.580 --> 15:46.580
Well, yeah, but I'm gonna be going to Alabama, though, next week.

15:46.580 --> 15:49.700
Alabama though next week well that's oh you're not gonna be here for next week's

15:49.700 --> 15:55.820
show well I will be here Sunday but that's the week as Wednesday the 24th

15:55.820 --> 16:04.260
okay moving on actually next Sunday is gonna be an interesting show because I

16:04.260 --> 16:07.380
have to get up at 4 in the morning on that Monday I'm going to LA for a day

16:07.380 --> 16:11.180
for work so I didn't even think I'd be able to do the show but it does look

16:11.180 --> 16:15.820
like I will be able to do show not that you care anyway flow walk since you

16:15.820 --> 16:19.780
You have a microphone, why don't you let us know, how was your week, how was your day?

16:19.780 --> 16:25.500
Week was different because as I just started my new job over at Princeton Review up in

16:25.500 --> 16:32.820
the city and it's just really weird just seeing like just all the stuff that goes on because

16:32.820 --> 16:38.620
mostly I do like I do a lot of like online type QA so all the college applications they

16:38.620 --> 16:43.060
do online I'm working on all that kind of stuff it's kind of funny well also kind of

16:43.060 --> 16:46.060
depressing in the sense that I'm sitting here thinking,

16:46.060 --> 16:49.780
I used to do this stuff for AltaVista about four years ago,

16:49.780 --> 16:51.580
and I got paid about three times as much

16:51.580 --> 16:54.340
to do the same exact work I'm doing now.

16:54.340 --> 16:56.220
And you'd always think it would be kind of opposite

16:56.220 --> 16:59.300
considering inflation, all that kind of stuff.

16:59.300 --> 17:01.900
Yeah, now I'd be making more since I've been there,

17:01.900 --> 17:03.880
done that, and it's just like regression,

17:03.880 --> 17:06.880
and it's kind of a trippy feeling, really.

17:08.880 --> 17:10.860
Other than that, it's just mostly been,

17:10.860 --> 17:12.740
yeah, just busy type of work week,

17:12.740 --> 17:19.740
And then, it's all on the personal side, I've actually been up in SACTO this week and I'm just, you know, visiting friends, you know, that kind of stuff.

17:19.740 --> 17:26.740
Just kind of getting reacquainted with more games and all that jazz, been like playing SmackDown vs Raw ad nauseam now.

17:26.740 --> 17:33.740
And, uh, let's see, gosh, it's, um, yeah, it's been a pretty tame week all things considered.

17:33.740 --> 17:38.740
Well, now that, you know, this coming week, we've got the whole UltraMix 2 thing coming out and stuff, so,

17:38.740 --> 17:43.220
I'm sort of, you know, kind of thinking here, well, what can I officially disclaim, you

17:43.220 --> 17:45.100
know, as of right now, and...

17:45.100 --> 17:48.500
Yeah, it's like, what parts of the NDA can I blab about now?

17:48.500 --> 17:52.060
But it's got to be a little bit of a relief now that most of the song list is out there,

17:52.060 --> 17:53.620
that you can kind of go, okay...

17:53.620 --> 17:59.460
Oh, and for the record, I did not leave Konami in the first place, as I see in the chat room.

17:59.460 --> 18:03.520
I was actually laid off, which is actually, it's a little something that I'll probably

18:03.520 --> 18:07.940
get into later, because it's probably an interesting note about what goes on, you know, the inner

18:07.940 --> 18:12.180
workings of a crazy lab like that there's been lots of shake-ups in the

18:12.180 --> 18:15.020
video game world lately

18:15.020 --> 18:16.940
we'll get to know one of the other ones later

18:16.940 --> 18:19.140
yeah yeah funny enough

18:19.140 --> 18:21.180
but uh... let's see and then you know

18:21.180 --> 18:23.220
like that today now it's just like

18:23.220 --> 18:25.960
since i was up in fact i figured what the heck you know i'll just come on the

18:25.960 --> 18:27.700
orange lounge and uh...

18:27.700 --> 18:30.180
show them a good time or something and it's really weird because normally i

18:30.180 --> 18:33.820
have a sharks girl with me and she's not here and it's kind of

18:33.820 --> 18:35.020
bummed, but...

18:35.020 --> 18:36.040
Maybe she's listening!

18:36.040 --> 18:39.000
Perhaps, and she was uh...

18:39.000 --> 18:42.300
but she was up here one time when I wasn't, so I think uh... we're uh...

18:42.300 --> 18:46.100
That was a long time ago, it was years ago, but yes, she was here one time when you weren't, I remember that.

18:46.100 --> 18:46.900
Okay.

18:46.900 --> 18:49.860
But uh, while I was laid off, I see you on the uh...

18:49.860 --> 18:51.200
in the room.

18:51.200 --> 18:52.720
Well, you knew it was going to come up.

18:52.720 --> 18:56.500
Well, yeah. Well, I mean, it's really not a surprise for anyone...

18:56.500 --> 19:00.220
for anyone who hasn't been familiar with the game industry or just QA in general.

19:00.220 --> 19:05.380
Usually you're commissioned as working on a single project or just projects when they're

19:05.380 --> 19:06.380
available.

19:06.380 --> 19:10.700
The way the video game industry works is usually they'll get their games around springtime

19:10.700 --> 19:13.060
or like early summer.

19:13.060 --> 19:17.500
Usually they start doing QA for demos for like E3 just to make sure everything's stable

19:17.500 --> 19:20.500
enough.

19:20.500 --> 19:23.380
Once that goes around, then obviously you go into development and of course you need

19:23.380 --> 19:24.380
testers.

19:24.380 --> 19:26.660
Then you test throughout the summer, do like early fall.

19:26.660 --> 19:28.860
Once all the products get pushed out, I mean...

19:28.860 --> 19:33.100
Because everything, the big time for the gaming season is Christmas, so basically the games

19:33.100 --> 19:35.540
are being tested a couple months before then, right?

19:35.540 --> 19:36.540
Right.

19:36.540 --> 19:39.640
But you don't see a lot of big games coming out in January, February, unless you're Nintendo

19:39.640 --> 19:40.640
this year.

19:40.640 --> 19:42.780
I don't know if Nintendo has huge games coming out, but...

19:42.780 --> 19:43.780
But, um...

19:43.780 --> 19:47.740
Oh yeah, well you gotta, okay, a few here and there, but Sweet Coz 4 was supposed to

19:47.740 --> 19:48.740
be out Christmas, wasn't it?

19:48.740 --> 19:49.740
Yeah, it was.

19:49.740 --> 19:53.740
It was supposed to be part of that big Konami extravaganza blowout thingamabob, but, um...

19:53.740 --> 19:55.740
Sunday, Sunday, Sunday!

19:55.740 --> 20:03.740
But once around November rolls around, they don't have any projects left.

20:03.740 --> 20:07.740
The only thing you really do at Canine, for example, is once all that's done,

20:07.740 --> 20:11.740
you'll probably either be doing a few text checks or you're doing customer service.

20:11.740 --> 20:15.740
What really I found curious was they downsized customer service.

20:15.740 --> 20:18.740
And you would think, around this time when all their new tiles are coming out,

20:18.740 --> 20:22.740
you need people to support people.

20:22.740 --> 20:28.140
like well you know this game is crashing on my PC and that's like 90% of any problems people have

20:28.140 --> 20:33.700
like you know issues with Konami is like you know PC games well you know I'm running a P2 how come

20:33.700 --> 20:38.460
I can't play Silent Hill 4 DVD or ROM and you're just sitting there like shaking your head like

20:38.460 --> 20:42.860
man these people and then of course you get like a ton of foreign emails saying you know why can't

20:42.860 --> 20:48.220
I play Winning 11-8 you know that's like anytime you get a email from Brazil or like Europe or you

20:48.220 --> 20:52.680
you know, and that kind of stuff. It's always Winning Eleven or Silent Hill. You know, it's

20:52.680 --> 20:53.680
always PC games.

20:53.680 --> 20:57.960
I want to address a couple of points that are in our chat room, www.orangelaunsradio.com,

20:57.960 --> 21:04.280
click on chat. Totion says, if you aren't a part of X company, isn't the NDA dissolved?

21:04.280 --> 21:06.280
And I don't think that's not true at all.

21:06.280 --> 21:10.800
Oh no, oh no, no, that's hardly the case. I mean, it's like, I mean, you can essentially

21:10.800 --> 21:15.200
say, yeah, I worked on it. You can, you know, say something specific. But, I mean, NDA is

21:15.200 --> 21:21.200
They use that for stuff like, well obviously I couldn't tell you what kind of software they used for, you know, engineering the game.

21:21.200 --> 21:27.200
That's like what NDA's are, it's not so much to protect, like, yeah, this is what we're doing. Unless it's a top secret project, you know, that no one knows about.

21:27.200 --> 21:32.200
But since, like, say, you know, a game is public knowledge, you can say like, yeah, I'm testing it. What about it do you want to know?

21:32.200 --> 21:36.200
It's like, well obviously I can't say what's in the game, you know, at the time.

21:36.200 --> 21:40.200
Why don't I have a look? I happen to be doing my homework here.

21:40.200 --> 21:45.200
Jamie just pulled out her big business law textbook, just going to thumb through it and see what it says on it.

21:45.200 --> 21:49.200
Yeah, it's essentially to protect more or less intellectual property of Konami.

21:49.200 --> 21:54.200
I would compare it to, let's say, the folks that go on that game show Survivor, right?

21:54.200 --> 21:58.200
You got 16 people to go on the show, the damn thing's taped months in advance.

21:58.200 --> 22:01.200
They already know who won the damn thing, or at least they know who the two finalists are,

22:01.200 --> 22:07.200
but the contestants are still all under that gag order where they can't talk about it until it airs on TV

22:07.200 --> 22:10.200
you don't want to get sued for $110000,000,000

22:10.200 --> 22:13.200
Yeah, yeah, that's essentially what it all boils down to

22:13.200 --> 22:16.200
I mean, I have no problem adhering to that or anything like that

22:16.200 --> 22:18.200
Yeah, you don't want to get sued for $110000,000,000

22:18.200 --> 22:21.200
Yeah, and you don't want to lose your job just because you want to sound cool

22:21.200 --> 22:24.200
and like, oh yeah, I got the inside scoop

22:24.200 --> 22:28.200
I mean, it's a good thing that at least I'm pretty close with Jason

22:28.200 --> 22:31.200
You know, it's because most of the stuff we do is DDR-related

22:31.200 --> 22:34.200
So any time I ever even get tempted to say anything

22:34.200 --> 22:37.480
I'd talk to him first and be like, you know, is this cool, is this cool?

22:37.480 --> 22:40.840
I knew that Delirium was going to be on UltraMix 2 before any of you.

22:40.840 --> 22:41.840
My internet penis is huge!

22:41.840 --> 22:43.840
I have it if you're ready, by the way.

22:43.840 --> 22:44.840
Oh, okay.

22:44.840 --> 22:45.840
Yes, sir.

22:45.840 --> 22:46.840
Yeah.

22:46.840 --> 22:47.840
I mean, you'd be surprised.

22:47.840 --> 22:51.720
There are actually people who come to work for, you know, Konami at the time, and like,

22:51.720 --> 22:54.920
one day they'll say, yeah, Rumble Roses was in office, and you know, stuff like that,

22:54.920 --> 22:57.680
and like, the guy will just get canned, like, in one hour.

22:57.680 --> 22:58.680
Wow.

22:58.680 --> 23:02.000
So, they're pretty serious about stuff like that.

23:02.000 --> 23:07.400
But I mean, overall, as long as you know when to say when and just all that, you know, it's

23:07.400 --> 23:08.400
not a bad thing.

23:08.400 --> 23:09.400
Interesting.

23:09.400 --> 23:10.400
Jamie, yes, your textbook.

23:10.400 --> 23:11.400
The textbook definition.

23:11.400 --> 23:17.200
NDAs have been around for a long time and traditionally have been used among lawyers,

23:17.200 --> 23:21.320
investment bankers, and others involved in trade takeovers and other large corporate

23:21.320 --> 23:22.320
deals.

23:22.320 --> 23:26.520
NDAs swear the signatory to secrecy about confidential ideas, trade secrets, and other

23:26.520 --> 23:30.000
non-public information revealed by the party proffering the NDA.

23:30.000 --> 23:36.000
So, it's an actual contract and it's binding despite employment and anything else.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
There you have it.

23:39.000 --> 23:42.000
So, in other words, he ain't talking! You ain't gonna make me talk!

23:42.000 --> 23:46.000
I mean, basically, if you said, yeah, X Song is gonna be in DDR, it could be sued for breach of contract.

23:47.000 --> 23:52.000
Oh, yeah, but see, that's why I let everyone else handle all that. I mean, it's really gone to the point...

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
Although, at the same time, is it really that big a deal?

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
Yes, and...

23:56.000 --> 24:03.000
I guess so, with the licenses it could be, but especially when some licenses get cut right before the game comes out, I mean that's a big deal.

24:03.000 --> 24:15.000
Oh yeah, I mean, you know, if not for people basically going through and hacking party collections, you would have, you know, you wouldn't have known about the songs that never made it into DDR for, you know, whatever reason or all that kind of stuff.

24:15.000 --> 24:18.200
and funny enough it's usually licenses first

24:18.200 --> 24:21.960
that you know are often announced because obviously you need something to

24:21.960 --> 24:23.200
sell the game in

24:23.200 --> 24:26.600
you know you want to give the public something that's a familiar

24:26.600 --> 24:28.740
title that they can relate to like they say

24:28.740 --> 24:31.840
oh wow you know such-and-such artist yeah they're popular wow they got them in DDR

24:31.840 --> 24:32.960
that must be you know

24:32.960 --> 24:33.960
pretty big thing

24:33.960 --> 24:38.620
but at the same time the reason why you want to like keep gagging on specialty licenses is

24:38.620 --> 24:41.480
I mean nothing's ever really set in stone there are sometimes when you think you have a

24:41.480 --> 24:44.020
license in the bag and like it's a slam dunk

24:44.020 --> 24:47.540
next thing you know like the carpet gets yanked out so

24:47.540 --> 24:52.980
I mean it's to cover us from getting like egg f***ing young on our face or anything

24:52.980 --> 24:54.540
alright well fair enough

24:54.540 --> 24:56.540
that's what you gotta do

24:56.540 --> 24:59.540
moving on we were doing how was your day before we got on that little tangent

24:59.540 --> 25:02.620
I actually forgot to mention something that happened during my week

25:02.620 --> 25:09.060
I uh... I sprained my wrist and they put me in a cast on Thursday and I cut it off

25:09.060 --> 25:12.660
you took the law into your own hands or you took the law of medicine into your own hands

25:12.660 --> 25:15.660
Yeah, and I'm not wearing my brace either, because it sucks.

25:15.660 --> 25:16.660
Okay, I'm done.

25:16.660 --> 25:18.660
Do you have any pictures of you in the cast, though?

25:18.660 --> 25:22.660
I do, I have one online, but since I can't access the chatroom, I can't post it.

25:22.660 --> 25:29.660
I know, for some reason, I don't know why, but other side IRC, the network raises only lets two simultaneous connections from our house.

25:29.660 --> 25:36.660
Actually, go to www.darksakura.com slash images slash fuckcast.jpg

25:36.660 --> 25:40.660
Okay, I will put that in and then post it in the chatroom if somebody doesn't beat me to it.

25:40.660 --> 25:42.660
In the meantime, Loki!

25:42.660 --> 25:44.660
How was your week, how was your day?

25:45.660 --> 25:47.660
My week was, you know, it was okay.

25:47.660 --> 25:48.660
It was fine.

25:48.660 --> 25:50.660
Totally got this fucking headache today!

25:50.660 --> 25:52.660
And then it went really shitty!

25:54.660 --> 25:57.660
I don't understand it, I get headaches on Sundays.

25:58.660 --> 25:59.660
Why?

26:00.660 --> 26:04.660
It's always on Sundays, and it's always a sinus pressure headache.

26:05.660 --> 26:08.660
I think I'm allergic to something in this house, it's gotta be...

26:08.660 --> 26:23.300
a bad headache. And it's only on Sundays, so it must be Jamie. It was before she came

26:23.300 --> 26:31.260
over. Yeah, I'm not, I'm hypoallergenic. So, yeah, it hurts and I'm trying to, I'm looking

26:31.260 --> 26:37.060
at home remedies on the internet right now. I have all the remedy here. It's called Vicks

26:37.060 --> 26:39.060
Vapourrub and the tube.

27:07.060 --> 27:10.880
which I'm sure a lot of you guys are very proud to hear I'll tell you what

27:10.880 --> 27:13.380
though man we were talking about this a little bit on outside the box on

27:13.380 --> 27:18.680
Thursday but the Xbox live stuff is so detailed it's crazy being able to go on

27:18.680 --> 27:23.740
to bungee.net and see your statistics down to you can pull up a map of the

27:23.740 --> 27:28.300
game you just played and look at where you were killed and when by who is crazy

27:28.300 --> 27:32.060
and what weapon they used to kill you it's just insane the mouse is after that

27:32.060 --> 27:35.380
so I've been having fun playing that online although yesterday I did not have

27:35.380 --> 27:38.340
Well, I'll get into that in the FUs of the week.

27:38.340 --> 27:41.940
And then, what else did I do this week?

27:41.940 --> 27:44.520
I'm not a whole lot Bamani related.

27:44.520 --> 27:48.500
Because of Halo 2, my DDR diet fizzled pretty quickly there.

27:48.500 --> 27:49.580
So I gotta get back into that.

27:49.580 --> 27:52.900
I'm really hoping that UltraMix 2 coming out this week is gonna motivate me to get dancing

27:52.900 --> 27:57.500
again so I hope to see a lot of our listeners on Xbox Live come Friday when the game comes

27:57.500 --> 27:58.500
out.

27:58.500 --> 28:03.820
And we will be doing a special show when the game is released probably on 20 November actually,

28:03.820 --> 28:04.820
on Saturday.

28:04.820 --> 28:11.340
November special. Coincidence? Absolutely not. As far as the rest of my week and my

28:11.340 --> 28:14.660
day, I didn't really do a whole lot, although I did go to Rice Princess, you

28:14.660 --> 28:17.940
know her from outside the box on Thursday nights, she had her Harry Potter birthday

28:17.940 --> 28:22.260
party on Friday and that was a lot of fun because we drank butter beer and I

28:22.260 --> 28:26.100
drank all sorts of liquor and I passed out on the floor. In great tradition of

28:26.100 --> 28:29.060
me going to a party at Rice Princess and Lanky Style's house, I passed out

28:29.060 --> 28:34.180
halfway through the party and I really, I lost big time on Harry Potter trivia.

28:34.180 --> 28:38.260
that made me sad but you know since I don't read the books I was kind of

28:38.260 --> 28:42.700
screwed in the beginning but then this is the weird thing then the next night

28:42.700 --> 28:46.620
after the Harry Potter party the next night what do they show on TV Harry

28:46.620 --> 28:54.420
Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone coincidence I think I think it's a big

28:54.420 --> 29:00.100
fat coincidence you shut up all right that's pretty much it for my week of my

29:00.100 --> 29:04.060
day I don't have a whole lot exciting to report although there is a lot of

29:04.060 --> 29:07.780
interesting stuff going on locally now i know that we are an international show

29:07.780 --> 29:11.460
we've got listeners in canada japan everywhere and all across the u s but

29:11.460 --> 29:13.940
sometimes we like to talk about what's going on in our deck of the woods here

29:13.940 --> 29:16.260
in norcal in sacramento the area where we're at

29:16.260 --> 29:19.420
we've heard a very interesting rumor and mel you actually were the one that

29:19.420 --> 29:22.300
started perpetuating this rumor cuz i guess you've heard this from the horse's

29:22.300 --> 29:22.900
mouth

29:22.900 --> 29:23.820
hahaha

29:23.820 --> 29:24.620
well

29:24.620 --> 29:27.980
derby owners club is coming

29:27.980 --> 29:32.780
to sacramento from milpitas it's leaving milpitas bye bye and it's coming to

29:32.780 --> 29:35.180
Roswell Golfland, what games go to die?

29:35.180 --> 29:41.020
Yes, that does put a tear in my eye.

29:41.020 --> 29:44.660
I guess probably there's a couple reasons why it's coming up there.

29:44.660 --> 29:49.780
I think it's gone to the point where Milpitas, you know, you had a lot of people who were

29:49.780 --> 29:53.240
interested in the beginning and obviously it garnered a lot of, you know, people coming

29:53.240 --> 29:55.100
through a lot of traffic.

29:55.100 --> 29:58.480
Then a couple factors, I mean, you got D&B, which is like about a mile and a half, two

29:58.480 --> 30:00.280
miles away, which has it.

30:00.280 --> 30:05.320
It obviously pulls a lot of money, and I think some of the older folks like going there for

30:05.320 --> 30:10.040
the simple fact that you can actually get drunk and play, and all that kind of stuff.

30:10.040 --> 30:12.880
And you don't have to deal with birthday parties.

30:12.880 --> 30:15.120
Yes, seriously.

30:15.120 --> 30:19.800
And obviously, Roseville is a pretty high traffic area, from what I hear.

30:19.800 --> 30:22.200
And there's none left.

30:22.200 --> 30:27.200
If you love underage girls in bikinis, you will love Roseville Golf Land.

30:27.200 --> 30:29.000
I love Roseville Golf Land.

30:29.000 --> 30:34.160
I heart. Yeah, so it's going to be the first one up in that region of California, like

30:34.160 --> 30:38.300
SACTO, and I know there are a lot of people up here who like the game and have come down

30:38.300 --> 30:43.480
and played it and still keep their horses around. And yes, Derby Owners Club is like

30:43.480 --> 30:45.320
the initial D for Rednecks.

30:45.320 --> 30:50.880
I know for a fact from last week's show, Iguana Girl and Islander are all about Derby Owners

30:50.880 --> 30:55.920
Club. They'll be there. I will have to hang my head in shame and go into that place, and

31:25.920 --> 31:29.240
it must be true. Rumor is, yeah, if it's not on the internet it must be true, but rumor

31:29.240 --> 31:34.520
is that Sacramento is going to get 2DX again. And it's coming courtesy of Camelot Golf Land,

31:34.520 --> 31:39.160
sorry guys. That's the rumor we hear, that Camelot Golf Land's 2DX machine is coming

31:39.160 --> 31:44.880
up here. Sorry, but not really. I don't, I think that's a little more, I think the source

31:44.880 --> 31:50.820
is more reliable than the usual 2DX is coming to my neck of the woods source, but I still

31:50.820 --> 31:55.620
have such skepticism because I just, and the rumor is it's supposed to be upgraded to red

31:55.620 --> 32:01.480
by the time he gets there. Yippee! But the thing is that I would be so scared for that

32:01.480 --> 32:05.040
machine because it would die very quickly when all the kids start pounding on it with

32:05.040 --> 32:11.760
their wet little Gulfland slide fingers. Bimani machines don't deserve to be treated that

32:11.760 --> 32:18.000
way. No they don't. By me I think like I said it all boils down to the bottom line. I mean

32:18.000 --> 32:22.520
are more people going to come out to like friggin Livermore to go play 2DX or like Sacto?

32:22.520 --> 32:26.520
I mean, you take your pick.

32:26.520 --> 32:29.520
What, are you talking on Sacramento now?

32:29.520 --> 32:34.520
No, I was saying people are going to come to SACTO, not Livermore, or whatever Camelot

32:34.520 --> 32:35.520
is.

32:35.520 --> 32:36.520
That is Livermore, yeah.

32:36.520 --> 32:37.520
I think?

32:37.520 --> 32:38.520
I don't know.

32:38.520 --> 32:39.520
Oh.

32:39.520 --> 32:41.520
No, I think it's in the south somewhere.

32:41.520 --> 32:42.520
It's Anaheim.

32:42.520 --> 32:43.520
Oh, the Anaheim one?

32:43.520 --> 32:44.520
Oh, okay.

32:44.520 --> 32:45.520
My bad.

32:45.520 --> 32:46.520
I think.

32:46.520 --> 32:47.520
Oh, okay.

32:47.520 --> 32:48.520
Wow.

32:48.520 --> 32:49.520
But I think it's-

32:49.520 --> 32:50.520
I'm not sure about geography.

32:50.520 --> 32:51.520
That's right.

32:51.520 --> 32:54.400
tunnel vision screen i don't know the one where you have no no no that was

32:54.400 --> 32:59.200
she was she had a night vision but didn't shingles machine go to camelot

32:59.200 --> 33:02.700
i'd not be surprised when she got lost i think so i think she goes machine with

33:02.700 --> 33:05.740
the camelot now it might become an erosive

33:05.740 --> 33:08.600
she will is now an apartment complex but i don't know

33:08.600 --> 33:15.600
dead like this go

33:15.600 --> 33:17.600
That was insane!

33:45.600 --> 33:50.040
people will play. It's like you kind of go to a point where you start low, start low

33:50.040 --> 33:55.400
and then you eventually start getting a lot of people playing. And then like almost any

33:55.400 --> 34:00.480
other game you outgrow it. And there was only like so many hardcore people that still stayed

34:00.480 --> 34:05.920
around and played. I mean they're obviously in an uproar right now. But it's like they're

34:05.920 --> 34:11.160
having their farewell send off this weekend. Like they had a G1 tournament. So it's like

34:11.160 --> 34:15.760
They have a bunch of people playing, it's like a hundred bucks to enter, but seriously,

34:15.760 --> 34:18.760
these people are like freaking G's when it comes to playing this game.

34:18.760 --> 34:23.520
I mean, they're like, yeah, I got a 30th generation, you know, thunderboy princess, and you can't

34:23.520 --> 34:26.500
be beat on dirt and et cetera, et cetera.

34:26.500 --> 34:31.600
And it's, I mean, I'd be in the tournament if it didn't cost a hundred bucks a pop to

34:31.600 --> 34:32.600
play, you know.

34:32.600 --> 34:34.680
Is it true that there's celebrities that come to play?

34:34.680 --> 34:36.220
Um, yeah, actually.

34:36.220 --> 34:42.220
Funny enough, the people that, as far as celebrities that are interested in it, are mostly athletes

34:42.220 --> 34:46.940
because they need to do something during their down time, so like at the D&B over in Milpitas,

34:46.940 --> 34:51.620
a lot of the 49ers would come there because their practice camp is in Santa Clara, which

34:51.620 --> 34:53.480
is just down to 27.

34:53.480 --> 34:58.660
And then when you talk about other cities, like San Diego, some of the Chargers played

34:58.660 --> 34:59.660
there.

34:59.660 --> 35:01.820
There was a baseball player on Albert Bell.

35:01.820 --> 35:06.220
Now I'm surprised that Sweat from G4 doesn't come film these guys playing Derby Owners

35:06.220 --> 35:10.220
Club because that's all that's ever on that show are sports people because apparently

35:10.220 --> 35:13.260
they are the only celebrities that actually play video games.

35:13.260 --> 35:15.260
Them and Ayesha Tyler.

35:15.260 --> 35:20.360
Yeah, athletes, I mean, they're definitely all about video games in the locker rooms

35:20.360 --> 35:22.940
or you know, just like on their off days.

35:22.940 --> 35:28.820
And yeah, I mean all that pounding on a machine will definitely work out to Sweat.

35:28.820 --> 35:35.900
Alright, uh, well, hopefully, maybe we'll start seeing some celebrities at, uh, Roseville

35:35.900 --> 35:36.900
Golf Land, though I doubt it.

35:36.900 --> 35:39.820
You never know, you probably might see some- Maybe Schwarzenegger, that's the only celebrity

35:39.820 --> 35:40.820
that lives in Sacramento.

35:40.820 --> 35:42.820
Well, that and, like, the Kings.

35:42.820 --> 35:47.540
Oh, Vasta, you whore!

35:47.540 --> 35:48.540
I'm going to whip you!

35:48.540 --> 35:49.540
I'm going to whip you!

35:49.540 --> 35:52.540
I'm going to whip you like the Indian casinos!

35:52.540 --> 35:58.260
If you do that, we never gulp you!

35:58.260 --> 36:00.660
On that note, we're going to go to a break. We're going to continue the...

36:00.660 --> 36:01.660
Girly horse!

36:01.660 --> 36:08.460
Girly horse, you're a girly horse, a silly little girly horse.

36:08.460 --> 36:11.300
Welcome to Orange Laundry Radio, everybody. I am going to get to that announcement, but

36:11.300 --> 36:15.260
we'll go to a break first, because I like announcements after breaks. It's just me.

36:15.260 --> 36:21.220
In this break, another brand new UltraMix 2 song, as spoiled by the website, which went

36:21.220 --> 36:24.180
up over the weekend. If you want a link to that, just visit orangelaundry.com. We have

36:24.180 --> 36:26.940
a link right there. It's like our top news story.

36:26.940 --> 36:29.060
and her

36:29.060 --> 36:30.260
in this break

36:30.260 --> 36:31.980
well

36:31.980 --> 36:35.100
we're just joined by explicit randomly during every that's right we're going to

36:35.100 --> 36:37.980
go to a break right now

36:37.980 --> 36:42.220
this song is the interesting thing about this song it's also in

36:42.220 --> 36:44.540
that other dancing game

36:44.540 --> 36:47.220
and we'll talk about that and how interesting that must be

36:47.220 --> 36:49.300
the song is vanilla ninja

36:49.300 --> 36:51.520
and it's called tough enough

36:51.520 --> 36:55.280
who i really like the song all of an awesome song and it was like my favorite

36:55.280 --> 36:57.680
song in that other dancing game we're going to talk about that when we come

36:57.680 --> 36:59.680
We'll be right back after this.

37:27.680 --> 37:30.680
of his broken sheen

37:32.680 --> 37:34.680
So keep on looking for peace

37:34.680 --> 37:36.680
If you don't stop, don't fear

37:36.680 --> 37:38.680
Run away, go for the fire

37:38.680 --> 37:40.680
Baby, that's up to none

37:42.680 --> 37:44.680
Keep on living, don't stop

37:44.680 --> 37:45.680
Even the devil

37:45.680 --> 37:46.680
Get you from the sea

37:46.680 --> 37:48.680
Let the clouds rain

37:48.680 --> 37:50.680
Baby, that's up to none

37:50.680 --> 37:57.680
Oh, baby, I'm so in love

38:01.680 --> 38:05.680
When you feel it, the things you've been saying

38:06.680 --> 38:09.680
Never touch my smiley face

38:11.680 --> 38:14.680
You're such a change on your dreams

38:14.680 --> 38:21.680
I'm a disco face, feelings you can't take

38:21.680 --> 38:27.680
But keep on looking for me, looking don't stop, don't feel run away

38:27.680 --> 38:31.680
I wanna fly, yeah, baby, I'm just a nun

38:31.680 --> 38:36.680
Don't keep on living, don't stop feeling the devil in me

38:36.680 --> 38:41.680
Get you in the seat with a pile of rain, baby, I'm just a nun

40:11.680 --> 40:23.720
We're gonna do one more song here in this Ultramix 2 break.

40:23.720 --> 40:27.720
We're gonna do, whoops, nope, not that, that's not an Ultramix 2.

40:27.720 --> 40:31.360
We're gonna do, which one did I want to do here, ah, here it is.

40:31.360 --> 40:37.960
This is an interesting song, it's, the band is called Or If Is, like Or If Is, get it?

40:37.960 --> 40:44.960
and it's called I Spy. Enjoy!

41:07.960 --> 41:09.960
Oh

42:37.960 --> 43:05.360
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio and that break you heard Orifis with a song called

43:05.360 --> 43:14.160
I Spy, and before that, Vanilla Ninja would toughen up. Now, I remember when I first heard

43:14.160 --> 43:18.640
that song, I was kind of like, wait a minute, I've heard this before. And I was like, what

43:18.640 --> 43:23.180
the hell have I heard this before? Oh my God, this song was on In the Groove when I went

43:23.180 --> 43:28.600
back and played it in Jersey a few months ago. Coincidence? What the hell happened there?

43:28.600 --> 43:32.760
I don't know, but I would be surprised if, you know, I mean, because Vanilla Ninja is

43:32.760 --> 43:36.700
is a German group, I would be surprised if they just kind of like were of the opinion

43:36.700 --> 43:41.140
hey lets pour out our song to as many people as possible and that very well might have

43:41.140 --> 43:42.140
been the case.

43:42.140 --> 43:48.320
Now obviously since games are tested and planned for months in advance, this song was included

43:48.320 --> 43:51.620
in Ultramix 2 before In the Groove was ever released right?

43:51.620 --> 43:54.020
Honestly I don't know the timing on that one.

43:54.020 --> 43:58.700
I'm pretty sure it was, I think so but we'll see.

43:58.700 --> 44:01.860
So this is very interesting, anything else you want to share?

44:01.860 --> 44:04.860
It's the only song in UltraMix 2 that has a video, right?

44:04.860 --> 44:05.860
It has a music video?

44:05.860 --> 44:07.860
It does have a music video, yes.

44:07.860 --> 44:08.860
Interesting.

44:08.860 --> 44:09.860
Yeah.

44:09.860 --> 44:11.860
And they're not some bad looking girls either.

44:11.860 --> 44:16.860
I mean, kind of like, you know, take Vixen or like any of those female hair metal bands

44:16.860 --> 44:20.860
and kind of pop them up a little and yeah.

44:20.860 --> 44:23.860
You got Vanilla Ninja and they actually have a website out there and all that kind of stuff

44:23.860 --> 44:28.860
and I wish I knew German so I could get myself a free autograph.

44:28.860 --> 44:33.860
So if anyone can do some German translation for me, holler back.

44:33.860 --> 44:37.860
Autographbitte.

44:37.860 --> 44:40.860
So can you tell us anything else about the video?

44:40.860 --> 44:44.860
Because I'm assuming if we could look hard enough we could probably find the video, but I don't know.

44:44.860 --> 44:50.860
Well, it's a pretty, you know, rocking video. It's like, obviously you've got the vammers playing.

44:50.860 --> 44:57.860
I guess the best way to describe it in a nutshell is, if you took Christina Aguilera's dirty video and made it, like, presentable

44:57.860 --> 45:04.140
like the ESRB wouldn't nail us. It's kind of, well, it's just more so the setting, but

45:04.140 --> 45:09.100
it's a cool video. I mean, it's a hell of a lot less scandalous than Do That Thing from

45:09.100 --> 45:10.100
UltraMix 1, so.

45:10.100 --> 45:15.580
Oh, no, we're talking about Vanilla Ninja's Tough Enough from UltraMix 2.

45:15.580 --> 45:20.620
Yeah, like you said, I know you've been out of it. There's a whole lot of UltraMix 2 news

45:20.620 --> 45:21.620
this week, so.

45:21.620 --> 45:28.180
That's all right, well actually if you want to see, because actually the way we know that

45:28.180 --> 45:31.340
that video is in there is that actually if you go to the Ultramix 2 website, there's

45:31.340 --> 45:35.820
a still, one of the screenshots they have has the video in it, so you can kind of get

45:35.820 --> 45:39.780
a little glimpse of what it looks like there.

45:39.780 --> 45:42.820
But they're easy on the eyes, for the most part.

45:42.820 --> 45:43.820
Definitely.

45:43.820 --> 45:47.440
I think actually because when somebody on DDR Freak made the connection that that was

45:47.440 --> 45:50.820
the Vanilla Ninja video, I think they actually linked to the video I want to say.

45:50.820 --> 45:52.220
I think you can go check it out over there.

45:52.220 --> 45:58.020
I just was too lazy to check it out myself.

45:58.020 --> 46:01.620
So moving on, we just got some more guests in the house here.

46:01.620 --> 46:02.620
Like you, Sal.

46:02.620 --> 46:03.620
How was your week?

46:03.620 --> 46:04.620
How was your day?

46:04.620 --> 46:05.620
Pretty good.

46:05.620 --> 46:06.620
Just been working.

46:06.620 --> 46:07.620
Yep.

46:07.620 --> 46:08.620
Had the big party.

46:08.620 --> 46:09.620
Oh, wow.

46:09.620 --> 46:10.620
It's so weird to hear you and work together.

46:10.620 --> 46:11.620
You know what?

46:11.620 --> 46:13.340
Fuck you, buddy.

46:13.340 --> 46:16.340
It's so weird to hear you and attractive in the same sentence.

46:16.340 --> 46:17.340
Wait.

46:17.340 --> 46:18.860
Nobody said that, though.

46:18.860 --> 46:19.860
Anyway.

46:19.860 --> 46:24.960
a big birthday party that you were at, you know, the awesome geeky Harry Potter birthday

46:24.960 --> 46:25.960
party.

46:25.960 --> 46:26.960
It was the one where I passed out halfway through it.

46:26.960 --> 46:27.960
Yeah, on my bed.

46:27.960 --> 46:28.960
In Great Rob's Kitchen.

46:28.960 --> 46:31.100
Does my bed say Rob's Passout Place?

46:31.100 --> 46:32.100
You know why?

46:32.100 --> 46:35.380
Everybody, when I passed out on the floor, like, people would come by and kick my ass,

46:35.380 --> 46:36.380
literally.

46:36.380 --> 46:37.380
Oh, I kick your ass too.

46:37.380 --> 46:38.380
Rob's Passout Kick.

46:38.380 --> 46:43.780
So at one point I was like, God damn it, and I just went to the first place, I knew there

46:43.780 --> 46:44.780
was a bed.

46:44.780 --> 46:48.420
I wasn't exactly going to go into your roommate's room and pass out on their bed.

46:48.420 --> 46:49.420
That would have been interesting.

46:49.420 --> 46:51.420
That would have been kind of funny, actually.

46:51.420 --> 46:53.420
Yeah, but we don't need to get into that.

46:53.420 --> 46:54.420
Yeah, that's right. That's right.

46:54.420 --> 47:00.420
Anyway, other than that, I've been working and making the dough. Yep, good stuff.

47:00.420 --> 47:02.420
Alright, good stuff.

47:02.420 --> 47:05.420
Explicit also joined us during the break there. How was your week? How was your day?

47:05.420 --> 47:10.420
Okay, basically I'm up and down. The break is actually I moved to a new house and stuff.

47:10.420 --> 47:17.420
Looks very nice. Two-story house. Got my own bathroom. Got two bedrooms I can now sleep on.

47:17.420 --> 47:21.420
Wait, you have two bedrooms all to yourself?

47:21.420 --> 47:25.420
Well, sort of anyway. So what, you have your weekend bed and your weekday bed?

47:25.420 --> 47:29.420
Or is there one bedroom that's for the ladies, and then one bedroom...

47:29.420 --> 47:33.420
Oh yeah! Speaking of ladies,

47:33.420 --> 47:37.420
I'm supposed to go to a strip club next two weeks

47:37.420 --> 47:41.420
to sell them to my cousin's 18th birthdays.

47:41.420 --> 47:45.420
Guess I'm gonna have to eat some pussy again.

47:45.420 --> 47:51.420
You know what? Go Club! I don't need to hear that.

47:51.420 --> 47:57.420
Go Club Silverpoles. Wow, I was wondering when this show was going to go on the toilet. Thank you.

47:57.420 --> 48:01.420
But I missed what it was about. That's quite alright.

48:01.420 --> 48:05.420
50 straight casts. Anyway.

48:05.420 --> 48:10.420
I already talked about Halo 2. That was pretty much my week.

48:10.420 --> 48:15.420
Anything new going on at Paradise Island? The place where you work? You're still working there, right?

48:15.420 --> 48:16.420
Yeah.

48:16.420 --> 48:17.420
Anything new going on?

48:17.420 --> 48:23.420
We might get a new arcade vendor. There's a possibility since, for some stupid reason, they're not updating their machines anymore.

48:23.420 --> 48:28.420
Because pad vending is like, I think we're losing contract and stuff.

48:28.420 --> 48:33.420
We might get a vendor from the Bay Area and stuff so we can get, oh yeah.

48:33.420 --> 48:37.420
So I can talk to them by trying to get BeatMania 2DX Red there.

48:37.420 --> 48:48.020
That'd be nice. Interesting. Interesting. Is it a bitch to work through a vendor?

48:48.020 --> 48:53.420
Hell yeah! I had a deal with them during the last tournament for FU.

48:53.420 --> 48:59.720
I'm not sure if I'll have to deal with them again in February for SAC-TAC SmackDown tournament.

48:59.720 --> 49:03.120
Yes, I'm organizing another tournament in Sacramento.

49:03.120 --> 49:04.920
Alright, we'll be there, I'm sure.

49:04.920 --> 49:06.620
It's early February.

49:06.620 --> 49:17.580
will be there. Alright. Let's see, I'm just preparing for SVGL3. SVGL3, the tournament

49:17.580 --> 49:22.780
in December. That's right, I completely forgot about that. I'm definitely going to that.

49:22.780 --> 49:25.900
I just kind of forgot that it was right around the corner. Like, didn't they announce that

49:25.900 --> 49:30.860
tournament like months ago? Yeah, it was supposedly during the summertime, but they moved it to

49:30.860 --> 49:32.860
into the winter, I'm assuming.

49:32.860 --> 49:34.860
And then it was supposedly cancelled because

49:34.860 --> 49:39.860
I assume DCB doesn't want to be the main organizer for it anymore.

49:39.860 --> 49:41.860
Well, I'm sure somebody will pick it up if you didn't want to.

49:41.860 --> 49:42.860
I don't know what's going on.

49:42.860 --> 49:43.860
Someone else picked it up already.

49:43.860 --> 49:45.860
I've been so out of the loop on that stuff.

49:45.860 --> 49:48.860
I was so out of the loop ever since the drama and shit coming around.

49:48.860 --> 49:51.860
Like, oh, I got screwed up, B.A.

49:51.860 --> 49:52.860
Gah!

49:52.860 --> 49:54.860
For certain people.

49:54.860 --> 49:55.860
All right.

49:55.860 --> 49:57.860
According to the rules.

49:57.860 --> 50:00.860
The Dalles all announce the FU's.

50:00.860 --> 50:03.860
Let's back up six inches there. Let's back up.

50:03.860 --> 50:06.860
Back up. Literally, the mic. Back it up.

50:06.860 --> 50:07.860
There you go.

50:07.860 --> 50:14.860
And for the Dalles all announce later, it's going to be one hell of a ride for the FU's on that one.

50:14.860 --> 50:16.860
Alright. I'm looking forward to it.

50:16.860 --> 50:17.860
Alright.

50:17.860 --> 50:23.860
I kind of didn't get to talk enough about the whole vanilla ninja coincidence there within the groove and stuff.

50:23.860 --> 50:26.860
Are you afraid of the backlash that might be coming?

50:26.860 --> 50:28.860
I don't know, kind of hard to say, I mean...

50:28.860 --> 50:30.860
Because you know there's going to be critics out there.

50:30.860 --> 50:34.860
I mean, you already kind of know that with the step data,

50:34.860 --> 50:37.860
that's the first thing people always complain about with the new DDR makes is the steps.

50:37.860 --> 50:40.860
Somebody will not like the steps, that's just a given.

50:40.860 --> 50:44.860
But now you've got the fact that now people have something they're going to keep comparing it to,

50:44.860 --> 50:46.860
and it's kind of like, ugh.

50:46.860 --> 50:50.860
I didn't like the competition stepped out of very much.

50:50.860 --> 50:53.860
And I'm not saying that as a biased opinion.

50:53.860 --> 50:59.980
And I got more or less a lot of confidence in the people who I know who did the step

50:59.980 --> 51:02.240
data for UltraMix 2.

51:02.240 --> 51:10.340
But in the groove, I mean, obviously that's where it came from, obviously.

51:10.340 --> 51:14.380
Almost half of it was what you would expect already, but they have a knack for throwing

51:14.380 --> 51:18.180
in odd rhythms for no reason.

51:18.180 --> 51:22.020
You just kind of wonder if they're listening to the same song you are, but that's just

51:22.020 --> 51:25.860
hopefully it's not the same edit oh no no not all trust like I said if I can

51:25.860 --> 51:31.060
say ours is better obviously ours is different okay and you know I mean I

51:31.060 --> 51:34.780
have to you know personally you know back it up because I did do some of the

51:34.780 --> 51:39.820
step data for us some of the modes I think it's it's interesting more than

51:39.820 --> 51:42.860
anything else that you know you're gonna have the same song in two different

51:42.860 --> 51:46.580
games two different cuts and two different sets of steps very interesting

51:46.580 --> 51:51.780
to see the differences there at least yours isn't gonna have mines right

51:51.780 --> 51:59.780
Oh God, no. And for the record, I saw Miklatov make a comment about all the girls looking like men.

51:59.780 --> 52:03.780
No, they don't. Only the one girl who has the bad 70s Abba hair.

52:03.780 --> 52:07.780
Only, you know, her bangs kind of throw her off, but she cleaned up since.

52:07.780 --> 52:12.780
And they still have that one girl, the youngest girl, who looks like Pornakova.

52:12.780 --> 52:17.780
Anything that looks like Pornakova is good to me.

52:17.780 --> 52:22.980
Wow. Okay. We're going to open up the Skype line in a little bit. If you guys have anything

52:22.980 --> 52:28.800
you want to ask about for UltraMix 2, as well as, oh God, what else? I mean, this is a big

52:28.800 --> 52:32.900
week, Bomani game-wise. I mean, this is the calm before the storm, because in this week

52:32.900 --> 52:38.220
we're about ready to hit the unofficial Bomani holidays of 19 November and 20 November, and

52:38.220 --> 52:44.900
now this year, this year we have 18 November, which is going to be the big day that 8 style

52:44.900 --> 52:49.420
consumer versions out, Popin Music 10 is out, and DDR Festival is all going to come out.

52:49.420 --> 52:55.620
And now we find out UltraMix 2 got pushed back to an 18 November ship day. So the Americans

52:55.620 --> 53:00.300
get in on it too a little bit. So it's going to be a very big week. So this week's show,

53:00.300 --> 53:04.100
this next week's show is going to be huge. Tonight we're just mediocre, but next week

53:04.100 --> 53:05.100
huge. No, anyway.

53:05.100 --> 53:07.060
This is an orgy waiting to happen.

53:07.060 --> 53:10.420
All right, we do have a call coming in on the Skype line. Let me take this real fast.

53:10.420 --> 53:13.220
I do want to get to that announcement too, I keep forgetting. But let's get to this call

53:13.220 --> 53:14.740
first real fast. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge.

53:14.740 --> 53:21.940
yo sky hi here who's this Ziggy hi Ziggy how you doing hey nothing much

53:21.940 --> 53:30.700
what's on your mind well I only have a one question for a for a guy what walk

53:30.700 --> 53:38.540
yeah for a little walk okay yeah yeah I just you know I just read this from

53:38.540 --> 53:44.300
the money style that DJ about last Tuesday DJ paranoia posted that Jason

53:44.300 --> 53:49.420
Because Enos is wanting to bring out 2DX in the U.S.

53:49.420 --> 53:51.380
What is your reaction about that?

53:51.380 --> 53:57.100
Well obviously, I mean, who in the Bimani community would not want to see 2DX in America?

53:57.100 --> 54:03.940
I mean, there's no doubt that there has been enough music games within the past three to

54:03.940 --> 54:07.860
four years to warrant that obviously, well yeah, you know, we can probably take it one

54:07.860 --> 54:12.060
step further, but I mean, there's a lot of things you have to consider when you want

54:12.060 --> 54:16.500
to bring a game like 2DX that's established in one country to another. Like, for example,

54:16.500 --> 54:21.080
you have like 11 styles in Japan. So, you know, it's, everyone knows what they want,

54:21.080 --> 54:25.340
are going to expect. However, if you bring it out here to America, well, you got to think,

54:25.340 --> 54:29.860
well, how much are people going to pay for a peripheral to a game that is completely

54:29.860 --> 54:32.940
absolutely new? You're not sure about that. Then you got to think.

54:32.940 --> 54:36.980
Well, but maybe, maybe the success of games like Donkey Konga and hopefully Taco Drum

54:36.980 --> 54:38.980
Master, maybe that would be incentive, hopefully.

54:38.980 --> 54:39.980
Okay, that's true.

54:39.980 --> 54:40.980
Maybe.

54:40.980 --> 54:44.420
Let's take it one step further.

54:44.420 --> 54:48.260
You got people, like I said, Bimani fans who would like to see a US version, they probably

54:48.260 --> 54:49.260
would want to buy it.

54:49.260 --> 54:54.260
That said, how difficult do you make it on the get-go?

54:54.260 --> 54:57.020
Do you want to make it easy enough for people to get it?

54:57.020 --> 55:01.140
Truth be told, 2DX is not an easy Bimani.

55:01.140 --> 55:05.900
When you compare the major four, for example, I would say 2DX, if you take the hardest song

55:05.900 --> 55:09.580
from DDR compared to like the hardest song guitar freaks to like you know 2DX

55:09.580 --> 55:13.460
and 2DX is a pretty difficult game I mean you know I mean of course it can be beat

55:13.460 --> 55:17.300
within reasonable time and such but then you gotta think you know it's like well

55:17.300 --> 55:20.380
are we gonna have a beginner mode for us are we only going to make it up to like

55:20.380 --> 55:23.620
you know the hardest song is maybe just the normal seven is there gonna be a

55:23.620 --> 55:28.560
flashing seven you gotta wonder about like being able to appease new fans but

55:28.560 --> 55:31.680
at the same time you don't want to insult the intelligence of like the

55:31.680 --> 55:37.600
Yeah, of the hardcore people, so it's kind of a hard, I think, I mean, just coming from

55:37.600 --> 55:41.600
me, I think that would be a little bit of a hard thing to gauge, I mean, I don't think

55:41.600 --> 55:45.820
it's impossible, and I mean, like anyone, I would like to see it come over, whether

55:45.820 --> 55:47.600
it will or not, I mean, you never know.

55:47.600 --> 55:53.840
I mean, obviously, with the success Biamani has been having, it's making a case stronger

55:53.840 --> 55:57.040
and stronger each day, so whenever it happens, you know.

55:57.040 --> 56:00.260
From your perspective, having been on the inside at one point, is there anything you

56:00.260 --> 56:02.260
Do you think we could do as Bimani fans to help?

56:02.260 --> 56:04.980
Like are petitions going to help or is it a lost cause or what?

56:04.980 --> 56:05.980
Well, I don't know.

56:05.980 --> 56:10.780
I have really yet to see a petition really, you know, like make a difference in anything.

56:10.780 --> 56:11.780
Right.

56:11.780 --> 56:15.780
You know, I mean, last time I ever saw that was quite a recall, but you know, that's a

56:15.780 --> 56:17.980
whole different story altogether.

56:17.980 --> 56:23.560
But I think it's more or less, you really just got to support Bimani and you just got

56:23.560 --> 56:27.420
to, I mean, it doesn't hurt to drop a letter into customer service once in a while to Konami

56:27.420 --> 56:30.060
and say, yeah, we're really interested in all that kind of stuff.

56:30.060 --> 56:51.060
I mean, sure, when you write it off and send it off, you think no one's ever going to pay attention, but you'd be surprised when, like, you know, as a product manager, I notice for like any video game, you always gotta keep your eyes and ears open because, you know, just like the slightest bit of, you know, idea or just, you know, hints or suggestions people have, you know, fans have a lot more influence than they think.

56:51.060 --> 56:56.060
Obviously they're not going to make the game all by themselves, but I think you have to

56:56.060 --> 56:57.060
figure that kind of stuff.

56:57.060 --> 57:00.380
I mean, if you want to have a successful game, you want people to buy it, you give them what

57:00.380 --> 57:02.820
they want, by and far.

57:02.820 --> 57:04.380
Very interesting.

57:04.380 --> 57:05.380
Very cool.

57:05.380 --> 57:08.060
Siggy, anything else you want to ask for 4.1?

57:08.060 --> 57:10.540
No, that's the only other question I wanted to know.

57:10.540 --> 57:11.540
Okay, cool.

57:11.540 --> 57:15.060
Hey, you looking forward to 8 style consumer?

57:15.060 --> 57:16.060
Yeah.

57:16.060 --> 57:18.420
Alright, call us back next week and let us know what you think, because I'm too poor

57:18.420 --> 57:20.260
to get it, so I don't know if we're going to get to look at it.

57:20.260 --> 57:26.640
Thanks guys. Alright, take it easy man. Alright. Bye bye. Very good question. I did not know

57:26.640 --> 57:31.100
that that kind of stuff was posted over on BemaniStyle, but that's what I get for not

57:31.100 --> 57:38.020
being in the loop on the different forums. Interesting. Alright, let's get to that big

57:38.020 --> 57:41.960
announcement while we wait for another call to come in. One interesting thing that was

57:41.960 --> 57:46.180
brought up on the show last week is that, is there a possibility that in the future

57:46.180 --> 57:50.040
that Orange Lounge Radio and DDR Freak Radio might get together and do something? And the

57:50.040 --> 57:57.400
answer is yes starting this Friday on what is the date this Friday Friday the

57:57.400 --> 58:01.560
19th starting this Friday you'll be able to catch the orange lounge radio rewind

58:01.560 --> 58:05.960
over on DDR freak radio that's the big announcement and if you've been paying

58:05.960 --> 58:09.840
attention to DDR freaks site feedback forum you'd already know that because it

58:09.840 --> 58:14.480
was announced earlier today but that's alright so maybe but maybe you want to

58:14.480 --> 58:18.120
go over to that forum and let them know what great news it is to hear that we're

58:18.120 --> 58:21.700
gonna be doing that so hopefully we'll be able to have a guana girl on the show

58:21.700 --> 58:24.700
again and do more kinds of things to partner up with DDR Freak Radio and let

58:24.700 --> 58:28.480
them know that there's lots of love for internet radio stations there's there's

58:28.480 --> 58:32.660
plenty of love for all of us so so that's exciting I'm really excited I

58:32.660 --> 58:36.000
think it'll help open up our show to a whole new audience over there and I

58:36.000 --> 58:40.940
think it's gonna bring their radio station something different I don't know

58:40.940 --> 58:43.720
if it's gonna work out good for them because our show kind of sucks but you

58:43.720 --> 58:45.420
No, I'm kidding.

58:45.420 --> 58:48.220
Our show rocks, listen to it every week.

58:48.220 --> 58:49.480
What, Lanky's down?

58:49.480 --> 58:52.820
I said, yeah, you've got self-confidence.

58:52.820 --> 58:55.720
Let me put it this way, if I wasn't confident in this show,

58:55.720 --> 58:57.760
I would have stopped on episode three or four.

58:57.760 --> 59:02.520
This is 117, or 118 now.

59:02.520 --> 59:05.520
Yeah, how long were you playing DDR?

59:05.520 --> 59:06.720
Shut up.

59:06.720 --> 59:09.800
All right, how long were you playing DDR?

59:09.800 --> 59:10.520
Excuse me?

59:10.520 --> 59:11.040
Yeah.

59:11.040 --> 59:13.160
Who was in Sacramento that, yeah, that's what I thought.

59:13.160 --> 59:14.160
Yeah, shut up.

59:14.160 --> 59:15.160
Well, yeah.

59:15.160 --> 59:16.160
Yeah.

59:16.160 --> 59:17.160
Uh-huh.

59:17.160 --> 59:18.160
1999.

59:18.160 --> 59:21.800
How are you doing over there, Darkstackeler, by the way?

59:21.800 --> 59:23.800
I haven't heard a lot from you tonight, which is rare.

59:23.800 --> 59:25.480
I hate my nose.

59:25.480 --> 59:26.480
Aww.

59:26.480 --> 59:28.040
So does Michael Jackson.

59:28.040 --> 59:31.320
Yeah, but he had the money to go buy him a new one.

59:31.320 --> 59:33.920
I need one that comes with completely dry sinuses.

59:33.920 --> 59:36.240
Yeah, you just need new sinuses, though.

59:36.240 --> 59:37.240
Yeah.

59:37.240 --> 59:38.240
Your nose is fine.

59:38.240 --> 59:40.240
I'm getting high off of this Vicks stuff, though.

59:40.240 --> 59:41.240
Awesome.

59:41.240 --> 59:49.400
I'm doing my homework, so yeah, I'm doing a homework on ethics and business and contracts.

59:49.400 --> 59:50.400
It's very boring.

59:50.400 --> 59:51.400
Fascinating.

59:51.400 --> 59:52.400
Very, very fascinating.

59:52.400 --> 59:53.400
Oh.

59:53.400 --> 59:57.280
By fascinating you mean boring, yes, it is.

59:57.280 --> 01:00:01.720
To answer some questions from the chat room about the whole DDR Freak Radio syndication,

01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:05.680
it's going to be 6 p.m. Pacific Time on Friday.

01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:06.680
That's awesome.

01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:07.680
On DDR Freak Radio.

01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:08.680
I'll be at work.

01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:10.880
Well, tune in from work.

01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:12.680
I don't know what to tell you.

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:13.680
No, that's a good idea.

01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:14.480
I have to try that.

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:15.320
You should try that.

01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:16.440
There you go.

01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:19.280
And just so you know, the Wednesday rewinds here

01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:22.000
on Orange Lounge Radio, they're going to change a little bit.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.200
Since we have our rewinds over on DDR Free Radio now,

01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:27.320
we're going to bring you classic and moldy episodes of Orange

01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:30.880
Lounge Radio that are freshly fermented.

01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:32.680
So year-old episodes we're going to start

01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:36.340
bringing you on Wednesday nights, like old stuff.

01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:37.840
That'll be the little change there.

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:39.160
Oh, we are getting another call.

01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:41.160
I need to pay attention to the Skype line once in a while.

01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:45.160
Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:47.160
Well, Legend of Zaku here.

01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:49.160
Hi Zaku, how you doing?

01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:55.160
Yeah, let me add a counter statement to what they said about American 2DX release.

01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:56.160
Okay.

01:00:56.160 --> 01:01:04.160
Seeing as, you know, going on the basis of the last presidential election and the fact that most,

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:09.860
The vast majority of this country is red and I want to follow up on that word just to keep

01:01:09.860 --> 01:01:10.860
it there.

01:01:10.860 --> 01:01:11.860
Wait, wait.

01:01:11.860 --> 01:01:14.320
Wouldn't that mean that 2DX Red might have some success here?

01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:16.320
No, I didn't mean that.

01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:21.080
What I meant is the red states, in particular the fact that you're releasing a seven key

01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:26.960
game with a turntable and the fact that it's going really fast and it's going to, you know,

01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:32.520
I don't know if we're prepared for the attention span that it will, because that will demand

01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:39.120
a lot. Especially from Americans who are... Alright, Mel's got his hand up. Mel's got

01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:45.400
his hand up. And I suppose that's why Omaha, of all places, got 2DX Red before everyone

01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:51.840
else in America, whom? Hey, I live in New York. Hey, I live in New York. My state has

01:01:51.840 --> 01:02:01.720
a nice style. It's only a nice style on the East Coast. I'm sorry, were you saying something?

01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:07.720
Let me put it this way. I don't know if 2DX will sell here.

01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:16.720
Let me sum it up. You're saying that basically, and you're tangent to the election aside, ignoring all that,

01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:19.720
basically what you're saying in a nutshell is that America is too stupid for 2DX.

01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:22.720
I don't know. Maybe. I'm not sure.

01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:26.720
What you're mainly saying is that people who vote for somebody you don't agree with are stupid.

01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:32.240
stupid. No, we all know that. You're misunderstanding my point. You're misunderstanding me right

01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:40.680
now. Look, listen. What I'm trying to say is that in a video game country, in a country

01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:45.400
where basically the vast majority of video games are like what? Right now it's mostly

01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:54.400
you know, Halo. It's like first person shooting sports and fighting games. Dancing games is

01:02:54.400 --> 01:03:00.880
up there and make some highlights and a few and took the limelight a little bit, but you're

01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:07.360
talking about something that, I don't know, the same way that DDR supposedly came here

01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:14.520
because it didn't plan this to arrive because it only came with a few thousand copies thinking

01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:18.120
that it wasn't going to sell because of the cultural differences. That's what I'm trying

01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:19.120
to say.

01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:21.780
Okay, you know what, that sounds very familiar.

01:03:21.780 --> 01:03:26.760
You actually sound like the president of Konami around circa 2000.

01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:32.800
This is when Jason Neils had fought for about three years to get DDR in America.

01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:37.000
Somehow Jason had begged and clotted and did everything in his power to get DDR released

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.340
into America.

01:03:38.340 --> 01:03:42.720
The president only made them press about 20,000 copies or so.

01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:47.200
He was absolutely confident this would not sell, it would not do well in America.

01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:53.200
And, you know, lo and behold, when it did come out to America, it sold out, like, at a record pace.

01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:57.700
You try to go to Fry's or any other place that sold video games, there was no way in hell you could find a copy.

01:03:57.700 --> 01:04:02.200
People had to pay, like, 70 or 80 dollars for a PS1 freaking game, you know, for crying out loud.

01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:05.000
And that's not even counting the ones with, like, a bundle, so...

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:10.900
And remember, this was at a time when music games did not have nearly as much fanfare as it does now.

01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:16.000
I mean, now that not only do you have Konami, but, you know, you had, like, people from Harmonix that did frequency amplitude.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.780
now you know karaoke revolution that you got the MTV you know so I'm just saying

01:04:19.780 --> 01:04:25.260
you know I mean it's a legitimate idea to say that you know b2dx might not sell

01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:29.140
well that may be true you know it's like I wouldn't put it so it's you know for

01:04:29.140 --> 01:04:33.020
the fact that people are too stupid for it let let me let that go finish the

01:04:33.020 --> 01:04:38.060
stock basically I can understand that there's only I can't understand why

01:04:38.060 --> 01:04:42.880
there's only two bemon two forms of Armani here GDR and karaoke revolution

01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:48.880
Adding a third and trying to expand gradually from what's already there in Japan, I'm not sure.

01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:55.880
I know both did well. In a sense, it might be a slippery slope on one side,

01:04:55.880 --> 01:05:02.880
but as long as fans can back it up and regular people can learn how to be tolerant and embrace it,

01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:06.880
then there's a good chance it'll sell and make a repeat of the last two.

01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:09.880
Alright, the bottom line is, if it came out, you'd buy it, right?

01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:10.880
I would buy it, no doubt.

01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:12.880
There you go. At least the support would be there.

01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:16.880
Alright, we gotta move on. So thank you for calling, Zaku. Have a good one.

01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:18.880
I just want to make a really quick comment.

01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:19.880
Very interesting perspective.

01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:26.880
I want to make a really quick comment. A lot of games in Japan never come here because people think we're not gonna get it.

01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:30.880
There's just too many cultural differences. Look at games like Katamari Damacy.

01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:32.880
I was just thinking the same thing as you were saying that.

01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:34.880
Animal Crossing.

01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:43.880
Katamari Damacy, Incredible Crisis didn't sell incredibly, but it was pretty tough to find.

01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:44.880
It had a following.

01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:46.880
I mean, the little amount of copies they...

01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:47.880
Even Bust A Move.

01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:53.880
Yeah, Bust A Move. That was like right around the same time DDR first came out, when the first Bust A Move game came out.

01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:58.880
The first Bust A Move had been out. I had the second one before the first one came out.

01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:26.880
And essentially, like, all that stuff becomes cult hit. I mean, like, Parappa was, you know, first Japan, if I'm not mistaken, or whatever, and then, yeah, it came out here, and it sold about, like, 30-40,000 units, which, essentially, in the game industry, 25,000 is considered, like, a cult hit, so, you know, and, just like DDR, the minute you get a cult following, you know, if it has, if the game is good enough and has staying power, and you have enough fans that back it, it's gonna blow up eventually, you know, it will run its course.

01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:31.200
I mean, and it's just, that's usually how they all start, whenever something new comes

01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:34.040
out it's a quote-unquote cult hit.

01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:38.880
I mean, this is, maybe people are going to probably bash me for saying this, but first

01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:42.160
person shooters didn't used to be the most popular game in the world.

01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:47.240
But then ever since, you know, Doom came out, just, it started going, getting more and more

01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:51.880
popular and then, and then we got, then we got, then we got Goldeneye, and then.

01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:54.600
But first person shooters weren't really possible before Doom.

01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:56.200
No, no, yes they were.

01:06:56.200 --> 01:07:02.200
there were games before Doom, I played them before. They were 3D technically, but they

01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:03.440
were first responders.

01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:07.800
I think, you know what though, Zaku does bring up an interesting perspective. I think what

01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:13.500
basically he's saying and how Mel makes the comparison where, you know, this was the same

01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:17.920
reservation as the Konami had about DDR several years ago, is that people wouldn't get it.

01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:20.520
Well, they're just having those same concerns all over again. I don't think that comes as

01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:23.200
a surprise to any of us, basically, so, you know.

01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:27.560
I think with a good marketing campaign, I think it would definitely move.

01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:32.400
I think a lot of it has to do with what is 2DX's niche, too?

01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:35.800
DDR makes you lose your butt a little bit, right?

01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:36.800
It makes you work out.

01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:38.880
And then 2DX is just fans of music.

01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:42.560
People who like the feeling that they're creating a song, but with no talent.

01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:43.560
No, just kidding.

01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:44.560
I'm just kidding.

01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:45.560
I'm just kidding.

01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:49.320
There's a lot of people out there who play 2DX that are extremely talented, but it's

01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:55.360
easier to make the music, you could say, playing 2DX than actually going and producing music

01:07:55.360 --> 01:08:00.520
from the ground up. And everybody, I think, gets that feeling. I remember the first time

01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:05.360
I ever played Hip Hop Mania, Complete Mix 1, when it first came out in America, way

01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:10.280
back in the day, and I played, you know, was it Believe Again or something like really

01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:14.720
old, I was just like, I feel like I'm making music. I pressed a key, and then I pressed

01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:21.060
the key again and this turntable is cool. You know, I love music. I've grown up loving

01:08:21.060 --> 01:08:27.180
music and I still love music. Obviously a lot of people love music, so I think you just

01:08:27.180 --> 01:08:32.860
point at these things in a sales campaign or something and sell it off of its music.

01:08:32.860 --> 01:08:36.500
Well I just kind of hope that the success of Donkey Kongo, which I believe has been

01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:42.020
a fairly successful game so far, Taiko Drum Master, not Taiko no Tatujin of Japan, a little

01:08:42.020 --> 01:08:45.860
early to tell I think of that one so far if it's been successful or not but hopefully

01:08:45.860 --> 01:08:50.940
if these games that come bundled with peripherals are somewhat successful hopefully maybe Konami

01:08:50.940 --> 01:08:55.080
will go okay maybe maybe maybe maybe America feels a little different about peripherals

01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:59.420
now because I think a long time ago it was kind of like peripherals don't do well here

01:08:59.420 --> 01:09:06.440
super scope power pad you know everything pretty much tank u-force power glove well

01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:11.260
how much is a how much is a like an official Konami dance pad right now still about I don't

01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:15.260
I mean, to get an official Konami pad, you'd have to buy a bundle, usually.

01:09:15.260 --> 01:09:20.260
I mean, if you go to, like, some, like, Starlax 8 Toys and Joys, yeah, you can probably get for, like, 30, 40 bucks.

01:09:20.260 --> 01:09:24.260
But the bundle, I think they run about somewhere around $79 to $80, give or take.

01:09:24.260 --> 01:09:29.260
I believe they are selling an UltraMix 2 bundle on Amazon right now for $59.99.

01:09:29.260 --> 01:09:37.260
Okay, so, what I'm saying is that when the Konami pads officially came out originally, they were over $50 apiece.

01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:39.380
they were over fifty bucks a piece

01:09:39.380 --> 01:09:42.500
to import them before they came out here they were usually like seventy

01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:44.220
something bucks a piece

01:09:44.220 --> 01:09:46.540
obviously the prices dropped

01:09:46.540 --> 01:09:47.400
substantially

01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:51.220
well mad cats had a lot to do with that too with their you know bargain basement

01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:54.700
dance pads well no i'm talking about official pads that are actually

01:09:54.700 --> 01:09:57.680
quality made pads

01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:01.520
you know i think the same could be done with a konami controller i mean

01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:03.320
ever since the 2DX

01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:05.820
official konami controller not the arcade style

01:10:05.820 --> 01:10:08.340
ever since they came out they've been around a hundred dollars

01:10:08.340 --> 01:10:10.700
and they still are around a hundred dollars

01:10:10.700 --> 01:10:12.420
i'm sure they could

01:10:12.420 --> 01:10:15.180
work something out where they could drop the price a little bit for an american

01:10:15.180 --> 01:10:16.540
you know release

01:10:16.540 --> 01:10:20.820
sony does it all the time they take big you know maybe uh... konami could outsource

01:10:20.820 --> 01:10:22.840
a company to make a quality

01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:23.980
controller

01:10:23.980 --> 01:10:25.480
you know interesting

01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:28.400
you know and take and take a little bit of loss for a little while till the game

01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:30.460
gets you know who knows maybe

01:10:30.460 --> 01:10:33.040
sony makes peripherals why can't sony do it

01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:34.500
they got money

01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:37.860
So in other words, Konami, if you're listening, just take a chance.

01:10:37.860 --> 01:10:43.220
Oh my god. Take a chance on me. No, stop it. Take a chance. No ABBA. Take a chance. Is there ABBA in DDR?

01:10:43.220 --> 01:10:47.780
Or in anybody? Not yet, not yet. Then don't bring it up.

01:10:47.780 --> 01:10:49.940
Dancing quick.

01:10:49.940 --> 01:10:53.420
As long as ASCII does not make a seven key,

01:10:53.420 --> 01:10:56.140
ASCII is probably the worst five key

01:10:56.140 --> 01:10:59.660
controller ever made. Wait, is that the same company that made the ASCII

01:10:59.660 --> 01:11:02.020
pad for the Super Nintendo?

01:11:02.020 --> 01:11:07.940
That was, I think, at the time, the greatest controller ever made, so what the fuck happened

01:11:07.940 --> 01:11:08.940
to them?

01:11:08.940 --> 01:11:09.940
Management.

01:11:09.940 --> 01:11:10.940
I don't know.

01:11:10.940 --> 01:11:11.940
All right.

01:11:11.940 --> 01:11:12.940
Maybe.

01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:13.940
All right, we're going to go to a break.

01:11:13.940 --> 01:11:16.140
We got some more UltraMix II songs we're going to play for you guys.

01:11:16.140 --> 01:11:18.780
This next one, it's actually a really long one, so we're going to kind of shorten it

01:11:18.780 --> 01:11:19.780
a little bit.

01:11:19.780 --> 01:11:21.420
I'm going to kind of start it here in the middle for you guys.

01:11:21.420 --> 01:11:23.500
It's a group called Creo.

01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:24.980
I think I pronounced that right.

01:11:24.980 --> 01:11:25.980
Creo?

01:11:25.980 --> 01:11:26.980
Close enough.

01:11:26.980 --> 01:11:27.980
Close enough.

01:11:27.980 --> 01:11:28.980
It's K-R-E-O.

01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:29.980
Creo.

01:11:29.980 --> 01:11:30.980
Or if you said it backwards, it would be O-REK.

01:11:30.980 --> 01:11:31.980
I don't know.

01:11:31.980 --> 01:11:36.580
Anyway, the song is called Burn For You, and this is a new song that's going to be on Ultramix

01:11:36.580 --> 01:11:37.580
too.

01:11:37.580 --> 01:11:40.220
And don't play this at your local clinic.

01:11:40.220 --> 01:11:41.580
It might be a bad sign.

01:11:41.580 --> 01:11:42.920
All right, here it is.

01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:43.420
Enjoy.

01:11:43.420 --> 01:12:12.420
You need to get something you don't know You need to get something you don't know

01:12:12.420 --> 01:12:23.420
Let me tell you somethin' you don't know

01:12:23.420 --> 01:12:52.420
If you keep the secret, I will know If you keep the secret, I will know

01:12:52.420 --> 01:12:54.420
I'm learning from you

01:13:00.420 --> 01:13:02.420
I'm learning from you

01:13:32.420 --> 01:13:54.740
Let me tell you somethin' you don't know Let me tell you somethin' you don't know

01:13:54.740 --> 01:14:18.880
Should you keep the secrets I once told

01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:23.880
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na

01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:25.880
I'm burning for you

01:14:41.380 --> 01:14:43.880
Let me tell you something

01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:45.880
You don't know

01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:47.880
I'm burning for you

01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:47.880
Oh

01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:25.880
And there you go again.

01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:37.880
To the steps wide to orange path.

01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:39.880
This GDR sucks.

01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:57.120
We are back here on Orange Launch Radio, starting the Eurobeat party apparently, no sorry about

01:16:57.120 --> 01:16:58.120
that.

01:16:58.120 --> 01:17:01.080
That's what happens when I have things on repeat, it shouldn't be.

01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:07.680
Initial D. Initial D. We are back here on episode number 118, what are you boys talking

01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:08.680
about over there?

01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:10.680
What are you always talking about back there?

01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:12.680
Oh, we're gushing over the Rumble Roses soundtrack.

01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:14.680
Oh, you're right. We're talking about boobs.

01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:18.680
Well, it's kind of relevant because the game comes out this week here, so...

01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:20.680
I thought it just came out on, like, Friday or something.

01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:21.680
Did it?

01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:22.680
Yeah, I heard it came out.

01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:26.680
Okay. Well, I just know that this week I've got to go pick up a few games, so...

01:17:26.680 --> 01:17:28.680
Am I coming through on the mic?

01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:29.680
Do you have money for that?

01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:31.680
Yeah, I got a little money.

01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:32.680
Just teasing you.

01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:34.680
Can you check the levels? Am I coming through?

01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:36.680
Yeah, you're coming through. I can hear you.

01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:40.880
That's why I have these big space-age headphones on, so I can hear that the microphones are coming through okay.

01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:42.380
Yeah, now you look like a real DJ.

01:17:42.380 --> 01:17:45.280
Yeah, I know. This is the coolestest I'm ever going to get to the real thing.

01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:46.980
I mean, you've got the headphones on.

01:17:46.980 --> 01:17:47.780
I know.

01:17:47.780 --> 01:17:49.680
You're not particularly attractive.

01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:50.080
I got two-

01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:51.780
Just kidding!

01:17:51.780 --> 01:17:53.380
I got two turntables and a microphone.

01:17:53.380 --> 01:17:54.980
Aha! Okay, Beck.

01:17:54.980 --> 01:17:55.680
All right.

01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:57.380
Where's that, huh?

01:17:57.380 --> 01:17:59.680
Um, no, but...

01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:02.680
But... continue. Onto your topic, if you have one.

01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:05.580
Well, I was going to say Rumble Roses, but that's all right. If you guys are done-

01:18:05.580 --> 01:18:08.580
You were talking to Mel about the voice acting, right?

01:18:08.580 --> 01:18:13.580
Oh yeah, I was just asking if I ever asked him about the voice acting, if there was anything up with it.

01:18:13.580 --> 01:18:16.580
I mentioned it last week, but I couldn't remember it quite like you can.

01:18:16.580 --> 01:18:21.580
Okay. Well, no, I just was explaining to him, and I'm assuming it's not the game itself.

01:18:21.580 --> 01:18:27.580
The game, I doubt could normally release a game with seriously mismatched speech to the lip syncing,

01:18:27.580 --> 01:18:32.580
because it was like, in the videos I had, the voices were coming out of the wrong people.

01:18:32.580 --> 01:18:38.580
So I'm assuming it's just because somebody was skipping, whoever was playing over at IGN was skipping through dialogue in it, you know.

01:18:38.580 --> 01:18:41.080
You know how it is.

01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:45.420
And by the way, don't blame us people over at the...

01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:51.960
in the U.S. for the horrible dialogue within the game. We were only given one day to rewrite all that stuff, so...

01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:58.760
Even the producer admitted as much after we did, like, you know, some damage control. He said we should have been writing from the get-go.

01:18:58.760 --> 01:19:04.760
You know what's interesting, though, is that a lot of the earlier reviews of Rumble Roses have good things to say about the music. Very good things to say about the music.

01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:09.760
Oh, a lot of people I've been reading the reviews have been saying it's just a good game all around.

01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:15.760
I mean, I think, you know, the chicks thing has a big thing to do with that, but hey, it looks like a great game.

01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:22.760
Well, I think what Rumble Roses has best going for it is the fact that, I mean, you capture a lot of things that wrestling people like.

01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:31.760
They like wrestling, and most of the wrestling, they use the engine from Yuke's, which was the one that's been used for Smackdown for the past couple of seasons.

01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:36.760
So the people who buy the game have something they're already familiar with as far as gameplay.

01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:42.760
And then of course it's, you know, 100,000 megapixels or whatever, you know.

01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:49.760
So the characters are very detailed and, you know, they've got an engine for jiggling and all that kind of stuff, I'm thinking, you know.

01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:58.760
So it's, I mean, what's not to like? Visually great? Gameplay great? I mean, if you don't like, if you don't like wrestling, I mean, then...

01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:02.760
Well, wait a minute, that's the weird thing. I don't like chicks, and I don't like wrestling, yet I'm interested in this game.

01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:08.760
Okay, wait, wait, wait, that's because you're, that's because you're gay. And?

01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:13.760
No, no, no, that's the reason why you're interested, because you wish you could be as hot as these girls.

01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:15.760
Okay, yeah, I wish.

01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:17.760
Anyway, no, um...

01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:20.760
Yeah, blanket statement aside, anyway, um...

01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:25.760
Here's just kind of an old joke, but on a serious note, kind of, I don't know.

01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:27.760
Well, no, not any serious, just a joke.

01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:30.760
Yeah, it's got the whole engine for jiggling and stuff.

01:20:30.760 --> 01:20:34.760
You're not necessarily a boob guy, which you're weird if you aren't,

01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:36.760
but you're more of an ass guy.

01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:38.760
They got some pretty good accurate ass jiggling, too.

01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:42.760
I would say I'm more of an ass guy, and I still don't care.

01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:49.360
And again, you're gay.

01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:50.360
What the hell?

01:20:50.360 --> 01:20:51.360
What are you saying Miklo?

01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:52.360
You saying I'm wrong?

01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:54.360
What am I wrong about?

01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:55.360
Anyway.

01:20:55.360 --> 01:21:01.700
So anyway, about the voice of reason, one of our females in the chatroom, DDR Coholic

01:21:01.700 --> 01:21:04.600
says when will the games with the gyrating penis come out?

01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:07.880
I want to know when my thunder down under wrestling game comes out.

01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:12.880
If you want giant gyrating penis, that would have been in Katamari Damacy.

01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:13.880
Yeah.

01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:14.880
Yeah.

01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:20.880
Actually, no, there's a series of games in Japan that are shooters, that all the characters,

01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:21.880
shooter games.

01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:27.880
Floyd Walker's grabbing his testicles, like, he's like, oh no, okay.

01:21:27.880 --> 01:21:34.880
No, not that kind of, like a side-scrolling shooter game, that are, the characters, your

01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:39.740
your ship, whatever, is like a muscly, half-naked man.

01:21:39.740 --> 01:21:41.780
And this is like a big popular series in Japan.

01:21:41.780 --> 01:21:44.220
Like, it was on, if you search for, like, weirdest Japanese

01:21:44.220 --> 01:21:47.020
games on Google, I'm sure you'll find a link to it.

01:21:47.020 --> 01:21:48.260
So you know what?

01:21:48.260 --> 01:21:49.620
There are plenty of games.

01:21:49.620 --> 01:21:52.380
That's from Miklotov.

01:21:52.380 --> 01:21:54.780
OK, Skydish Kimborn punched me.

01:21:54.780 --> 01:21:56.380
Thanks a lot, Miklotov.

01:21:56.380 --> 01:22:01.940
He says, because not all gay guys want to be women.

01:22:01.940 --> 01:22:02.340
I know.

01:22:02.340 --> 01:22:03.940
I said, blanket statement aside.

01:22:03.940 --> 01:22:07.940
Obviously, I wasn't serious, but I am with you, Miklotov.

01:22:07.940 --> 01:22:09.860
No, I'm just kidding.

01:22:09.860 --> 01:22:11.900
It was fun to punch you anyway.

01:22:11.900 --> 01:22:12.400
You know.

01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:15.700
God, do not bring a boonga boonga.

01:22:15.700 --> 01:22:20.260
We do not need finger to the ass action here.

01:22:20.260 --> 01:22:21.460
Oh, man.

01:22:21.460 --> 01:22:22.860
Not that kind of ass.

01:22:22.860 --> 01:22:25.900
Anyway, I just thought I'd let you know,

01:22:25.900 --> 01:22:27.660
because girls always say this.

01:22:27.660 --> 01:22:30.420
When do we do the hot guys in games?

01:22:30.420 --> 01:22:34.580
Hot guys in games has been around since games came out, okay?

01:22:34.580 --> 01:22:38.260
They've been putting artwork on old arcade games with big, muscly men, and they still

01:22:38.260 --> 01:22:41.180
put hot guys, quote-unquote, in video games now.

01:22:41.180 --> 01:22:42.180
Like Karnov?

01:22:42.180 --> 01:22:43.180
What's that?

01:22:43.180 --> 01:22:44.180
What?

01:22:44.180 --> 01:22:45.180
What?

01:22:45.180 --> 01:22:46.180
I can play with John Cena at home, so I'm happy.

01:22:46.180 --> 01:22:47.660
I don't know who John Cena is.

01:22:47.660 --> 01:22:48.660
How about this is a weird...

01:22:48.660 --> 01:22:49.660
Oh, okay.

01:22:49.660 --> 01:22:50.660
Hey, hey, hey.

01:22:50.660 --> 01:22:52.460
How about this is a weird game right here?

01:22:52.460 --> 01:22:54.460
Mini Skirt Police.

01:22:54.460 --> 01:22:59.300
Wait, did you suffer weird games, like, people?

01:22:59.300 --> 01:23:00.300
Yeah.

01:23:00.300 --> 01:23:06.300
Miniskirt Police. It's a light gun game. Or I guess you take pictures of women in miniskirts.

01:23:06.300 --> 01:23:07.300
Okay.

01:23:07.300 --> 01:23:09.300
Not from Namco thing. Go Namco.

01:23:09.300 --> 01:23:13.300
Oh yeah. There's Namco for it. Interesting.

01:23:13.300 --> 01:23:19.300
They should have a motion capture version of that. MoCap miniskirt police.

01:23:19.300 --> 01:23:26.300
And you need a partner to play with in a miniskirt. So it's not really a game. It's just, yeah. Anyway.

01:23:26.300 --> 01:23:31.300
Hey, don't like the Japanese games, though, because they brought us Radiant Silver Gun, which I've got to play for the game.

01:23:31.300 --> 01:23:34.300
And an awesome spin-off called Ikaruga.

01:23:34.300 --> 01:23:39.300
Yeah, but I got to play Radiant Silver Gun Arcade Machine, and that makes me feel special for the rest of my life.

01:23:39.300 --> 01:23:44.300
On the now-vanished game land in Vegas.

01:23:44.300 --> 01:23:48.300
Ooh, cool. Radiant Silver Gun is pretty. Okay.

01:23:48.300 --> 01:23:49.300
Nice.

01:23:49.300 --> 01:23:50.300
Go on, Rob.

01:23:50.300 --> 01:23:56.300
Oh hell, did I have another topic? I knew I had something Ultramix 2 related. I want to get to the cage match soon too, but I guess we can do one more quick topic.

01:23:56.300 --> 01:24:05.300
You know that some of the first early reviews of Ultramix 2 came out, and one of them has been making rounds on The Freak. It's the one that was in GMR magazine.

01:24:05.300 --> 01:24:18.300
And apparently, they're not big fans of the game. But man, The Freak, they are tearing this guy apart. Like, I was just reading this. I'm looking at the thread here, page 160.

01:24:18.300 --> 01:24:23.300
I think it's 161 or 162 of the thread. Somebody tried, like, harassing the guy on AOL and

01:24:23.300 --> 01:24:24.300
everything.

01:24:24.300 --> 01:24:25.300
Wow, man.

01:24:25.300 --> 01:24:31.020
I would not say harassing, but, you know, maybe borderline stalking the guy on AOL trying

01:24:31.020 --> 01:24:35.660
to say, what's wrong with you? Fuck you, you fucking fuck! No, I'm kidding. It was more

01:24:35.660 --> 01:24:38.300
mature than that, but, you know, not by much.

01:24:38.300 --> 01:24:41.860
I mean, you know, part of half of me is, you know, saying, oh, yeah, go, you know, stick

01:24:41.860 --> 01:24:45.060
up for us. The other half is, you ain't even played the game yourself. You know, what the

01:24:45.060 --> 01:24:46.060
Hell do you know?

01:24:46.060 --> 01:24:50.300
So, I mean, I think ultimately, you know, only God could judge us, and if he did, he'd

01:24:50.300 --> 01:24:51.300
give us an A+.

01:24:51.300 --> 01:24:52.300
Or, okay, A-.

01:24:52.300 --> 01:24:53.300
There's always room to improve.

01:24:53.300 --> 01:24:54.300
Anyway, sorry.

01:24:54.300 --> 01:25:03.300
We're getting a call in studio during show, which is quite rare, because most people know.

01:25:03.300 --> 01:25:10.460
No, these are the stupid fuckers that, you know, have automated 1-800 numbers telemarkers.

01:25:10.460 --> 01:25:11.460
Oh, okay.

01:25:11.460 --> 01:25:15.620
Hi, this is Aris from GameStop.

01:25:15.620 --> 01:25:17.420
Aris?

01:25:17.420 --> 01:25:19.680
Are you dead?

01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:25.980
You get this automated call. Hi, this is Aris at GameStop.

01:25:25.980 --> 01:25:30.260
You've reserved a blank game. And it's like, Aris is like a reference to Aris from Final Fantasy VII.

01:25:30.260 --> 01:25:33.420
I guess. It's a meme, Mario!

01:25:33.420 --> 01:25:37.020
I just wanted to let you know that your Sonic the Hedgehog game came in.

01:25:37.020 --> 01:25:41.300
Mama mia! Even though, and people who have seen me play

01:25:41.300 --> 01:25:45.820
Final Fantasy 7 know this because I have my game saved at this one particular place. So

01:25:45.820 --> 01:25:50.460
that I can take this shit out of Jenova again and watch Aerith die all over again.

01:25:50.460 --> 01:25:54.020
Yes, it's a great thing to relive, right? Oh my god you guys, stop spoiling Final Fantasy

01:25:54.020 --> 01:26:03.020
7, I haven't played it yet. She dies! Get over it! And I cheer. Yeah, it's good. The

01:26:03.020 --> 01:26:09.340
only thing, in my opinion, that could ruin Advent Children is if Aerith somehow comes

01:26:09.340 --> 01:26:11.340
Oh my god, that would just...

01:26:11.340 --> 01:26:14.340
Okay, so, that being said...

01:26:14.340 --> 01:26:16.340
Guys, I have no feelings.

01:26:16.340 --> 01:26:19.340
Why? Tifa is a much better woman.

01:26:21.340 --> 01:26:22.340
She can kick ass.

01:26:22.340 --> 01:26:26.340
I can't believe we're having this discussion, so I'm gonna change the subject back to this review.

01:26:26.340 --> 01:26:29.340
If I got a call from Aris from Gamestop, I would run away.

01:26:29.340 --> 01:26:31.340
Aris had codependency issues.

01:26:31.340 --> 01:26:32.340
Yeah.

01:26:34.340 --> 01:26:35.340
Oh my lord.

01:26:35.340 --> 01:26:36.340
Lord.

01:26:36.340 --> 01:26:41.020
Well, if you want to join in the fun, they posted his AOL screen name and everything.

01:26:41.020 --> 01:26:44.900
I just think that's kind of interesting that they got the whole little, I mean, for lack

01:26:44.900 --> 01:26:49.220
of a better term, I know it's not these same guys, but I can't help but think of the word

01:26:49.220 --> 01:26:52.780
Be Mafia to describe what's going on here.

01:26:52.780 --> 01:26:56.300
I don't like using that term because I know it's not the same people, but you know what

01:26:56.300 --> 01:26:57.300
I mean.

01:26:57.300 --> 01:27:01.660
It's still the same idea where these guys are just hounding this poor guy that was just

01:27:01.660 --> 01:27:06.380
review in and decided to knock this game a little bit because it wasn't his cup of tea,

01:27:06.380 --> 01:27:10.540
wasn't Japanese enough for him, I guess, was the gist of the review.

01:27:10.540 --> 01:27:16.020
I mean, you never know. Once a festival hits Japan, Japan critics are going to say, you

01:27:16.020 --> 01:27:20.220
know, it's not American enough. That would be ironic, wouldn't it?

01:27:20.220 --> 01:27:22.900
Wow. But the good news is that some other reviews

01:27:22.900 --> 01:27:26.340
are coming out and I think we've seen like seven and a halfs and eights and, you know,

01:27:26.340 --> 01:27:30.180
average DDR scores are on the board. But I think, again, a lot of these people don't

01:27:30.180 --> 01:27:33.380
really you know the folks that review hundreds and hundreds of games you know

01:27:33.380 --> 01:27:35.620
for the magazines and stuff you know they don't have time to submerse

01:27:35.620 --> 01:27:39.180
themselves in the communities of all these games I don't think a lot of these

01:27:39.180 --> 01:27:48.300
folks maybe realize just how different and it's like how anticipated this game

01:27:48.300 --> 01:27:52.140
is in America just because it isn't a Japanese release you know what I mean I

01:27:52.140 --> 01:27:58.180
don't know that's just my take on it I mean it's finally like one of those

01:27:58.180 --> 01:28:02.180
games it seems to have very very very few ties to Japan other than the fact that

01:28:02.180 --> 01:28:05.060
hey the game was originally created there but it's like you know whole new

01:28:05.060 --> 01:28:08.500
interface, whole new game, whole new modes it's really truly like an American

01:28:08.500 --> 01:28:13.140
production. I think it's just kind of one of those things where it's just after

01:28:13.140 --> 01:28:17.620
time that series will have its own identity more than anything and that's

01:28:17.620 --> 01:28:22.540
all you can really I mean just die as a gamer think originality just like making

01:28:22.540 --> 01:28:26.300
you know like being a little different I mean sure you know DDR is pretty

01:28:26.300 --> 01:28:30.540
universal as far as like within Konami itself and all but if you got Ultra Mix 2 and it's

01:28:30.540 --> 01:28:33.820
like always kind of like that cutting edge type thing it's like why you know some people

01:28:33.820 --> 01:28:37.960
watch like M2 you know as opposed to MTV or you know watch all those other niche shows

01:28:37.960 --> 01:28:41.220
because you know it's like they already know they like the game but they want to see it

01:28:41.220 --> 01:28:44.920
to its you know maximum potential or it's something different and you know I mean it's

01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:48.160
why not.

01:28:48.160 --> 01:28:49.380
Very interesting.

01:28:49.380 --> 01:28:54.300
Apparently now I'm getting a follow up apparently our old Orange Launch Radio favorite El Mullet

01:28:54.300 --> 01:28:59.140
is the one that's been doing a little bit of this AOL harassing at this guy.

01:28:59.140 --> 01:29:04.700
Hey, he's the pusher for the cookies, so he gets the amnesty right away.

01:29:04.700 --> 01:29:09.060
That's right. But no, apparently he has responded. We don't know the details yet, though. I'm

01:29:09.060 --> 01:29:12.980
hearing this all secondhand, but maybe we'll... Keep checking the freak for developments,

01:29:12.980 --> 01:29:17.340
because maybe something will get posted there. Whoo! Drama, drama revolution. Gotta love

01:29:17.340 --> 01:29:23.940
it. All right. It feels like old times, doesn't it?

01:29:23.940 --> 01:29:29.940
DD Archaholic is still fixated on the whole once a male game and this is what she sent me in a private message.

01:29:29.940 --> 01:29:37.940
She says, I want my boyfriend to watch me play the game and start crying because the game makes him feel inadequate while I enthusiastically play the hell out of it.

01:29:37.940 --> 01:29:38.940
Who said this?

01:29:38.940 --> 01:29:39.940
DD Archaholic.

01:29:39.940 --> 01:29:42.940
Oh, I thought this was Rice Prince.

01:29:42.940 --> 01:29:45.940
No, no. That would have been funny though.

01:29:45.940 --> 01:29:47.940
That's great.

01:29:47.940 --> 01:29:48.940
I'm sure she would have said it too.

01:29:48.940 --> 01:29:57.940
You know what, though? That's happened. That's all personal preference, what game makes you want to play it so much.

01:29:57.940 --> 01:30:04.940
There's been times where Ice Princess was so hooked on the game where she would just play it all the time and we didn't really have time for much else.

01:30:04.940 --> 01:30:09.940
That's just how it is. You're a gamer, you're in a relationship, things like this happen.

01:30:09.940 --> 01:30:14.940
So, why am I going on with like the whole, it's like I'm advising her or something.

01:30:14.940 --> 01:30:17.940
Whatever. Yeah. Don't play Puzzle Pirates.

01:30:19.940 --> 01:30:21.940
Sorry. Anyway.

01:30:21.940 --> 01:30:25.940
Okay, I think it's time for us to get into the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.

01:30:25.940 --> 01:30:27.940
What do you guys think?

01:30:27.940 --> 01:30:29.940
Sure. Please.

01:30:32.940 --> 01:30:36.940
Last week in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, Jamie won it with a song.

01:30:36.940 --> 01:30:41.260
song I guess it's some sort of parody song it was a little silly five four

01:30:41.260 --> 01:30:47.000
three one of that but it was very popular nonetheless it was nonetheless

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:52.240
and that won our cage match with a sweeping victory it was Vlad with

01:30:52.240 --> 01:30:55.920
electronic supersonic and that's the first song we're gonna hear a clip of in

01:30:55.920 --> 01:31:01.300
tonight's cage match now here's the thing here's the thing yeah Loki much to

01:31:01.300 --> 01:31:06.600
Loki's hatred he does not like this song he is only pissed off because he's the

01:31:06.600 --> 01:31:08.600
the one that usually puts the smart-ass songs in.

01:31:08.600 --> 01:31:12.600
I'm debating whether to put a really shitty song or a really good song tonight.

01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:14.600
Hold on, I have to agree. I...

01:31:14.600 --> 01:31:18.600
Papa Smurf was awesome.

01:31:18.600 --> 01:31:24.600
Okay, hold on. Way back in the day, back when you weren't in the hundreds yet in episodes,

01:31:24.600 --> 01:31:27.600
like probably not even in the 20s or something, I once...

01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:31.600
We didn't have three people for a cage match, so I once...

01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:34.600
I said, go ahead and put in one of my songs, and you're like, what is this?

01:31:34.600 --> 01:31:36.600
God, I'm not ready for this.

01:31:36.600 --> 01:31:40.600
And I put in a Aquabats song, which is a pretty popular ska group.

01:31:40.600 --> 01:31:45.600
And you said, I don't see that as a cage match song.

01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:51.600
How is Dark Sacular's song, though it is very funny, any different than that?

01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:54.600
It is not what you would see as a cage match song, but you didn't say anything.

01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:55.600
Here's the thing, though, in the past...

01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:57.600
No, the thing is, though, you're full of shit.

01:31:57.600 --> 01:31:58.600
The thing is, though...

01:31:58.600 --> 01:31:59.600
Oh, shit.

01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:00.600
Shut up before I shut my cock in your mouth.

01:32:00.600 --> 01:32:08.120
your mouth shut up the cage match has evolved an awful lot the past you know

01:32:08.120 --> 01:32:12.200
hundred episodes we've been doing it I think it used to be the thing where it

01:32:12.200 --> 01:32:17.520
was like DDR guitar breaks 2dx now it's kind of like cool stuff no no no wait

01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:22.560
wait okay wait I'm totally calling bullshit because I have said they're not

01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:27.920
age man just wait for about four weeks ago or five weeks ago Matt put on a song

01:32:27.920 --> 01:32:37.440
by um no no no no no no no the song you put on by um CompuFonic uh what's the name of the band?

01:32:37.440 --> 01:32:44.400
Echo Image. Echo Image um what's the name of that song? Come Back. Come Back. That song is awesome

01:32:44.400 --> 01:32:48.920
and you said I won't see it as a cage match song. I didn't I still don't. It totally fits perfectly

01:32:48.920 --> 01:32:55.000
into the genre of music we play. It was techno pop or electro pop or whatever you know. I didn't and I still don't.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:33:06.000
What do I know? Because it's the first song ever to have to be retired from the cage match, so obviously it doesn't come down to my opinion, it comes down to the opinion of the listeners.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:09.000
So put that in your pipe and smoke it.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:15.000
Whatever happened to the days when we used to say that we do this radio show for our amusement, not their amusement?

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:18.000
Well, we sold out like cheap whores, what do you expect?

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:22.000
Thank you, Sal. Thank you, Sal. Can I have a hug?

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:25.000
Get away from me. Can I have a hug?

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
I want a hug. There.

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:30.000
We're going to put our differences aside.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:33.000
Stop trying to grope me. Get away from me.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:37.000
You're hugging very provocative.

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:41.000
It feels very erotic. You've got to do that. I'm kidding.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:45.000
You want me to make a video game out of that?

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:52.000
There was that one game that was at the Natsume booth at E3, where you go around kissing people.

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:53.000
Yeah, Tulip.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:54.000
Tulip.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:55.000
Alright, anyway.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:56.000
Hello, cage match.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:57.000
Hello.

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:58.880
Alright, we're gonna get into this.

01:33:58.880 --> 01:34:00.880
It's electronic supersonic.

01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:04.160
You get to hear a clip of it, because it won last week, and then you'll hear two new songs

01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:08.160
in their entirety, and I can't wait to hear what you all have to say about my pick tonight.

01:34:08.160 --> 01:34:09.160
He's gonna love it.

01:34:09.160 --> 01:34:10.160
Anyway.

01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:13.680
I thought we did piss Brad off on our show on Thursday.

01:34:13.680 --> 01:34:14.680
Sorry, sorry.

01:34:14.680 --> 01:34:21.680
Before we go, you can vote for this if you want. It's a clip of song number one. This is Zladd with Electronic Supersonic. Enjoy.

01:34:44.680 --> 01:34:48.680
He doesn't have much time, my blue jeans is tight

01:34:48.680 --> 01:34:51.680
So onto my love rocket climb

01:34:51.680 --> 01:34:54.680
Inside tank of fuel is not fuel, but love

01:34:54.680 --> 01:34:58.680
Above us, there is nothing above, but the stars above

01:34:58.680 --> 01:35:01.680
All systems gone, prepare for down count

01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:07.680
Five, four, three, one, off blast

01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:10.680
Fly away my space rocket

01:35:10.680 --> 01:35:13.680
You no need put money in my pocket

01:35:13.680 --> 01:35:23.680
pocket. The door is closed, I just lock it. I put my gold plug in your socket.

01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:30.680
The sun and sky is bright like fire. You and me gets higher and higher.

01:35:30.680 --> 01:35:41.680
I've got no communication bias. The only thing that can stop us is flat tires.

01:35:41.680 --> 01:35:45.680
Hail, love crusader, I want to be your space invader

01:35:45.680 --> 01:35:48.680
For you I will descend the deepest moon crater

01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:51.680
I is more stronger than Darth Vapour

01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:54.680
Obey me, I is your new dictator

01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:56.680
For you is Venus, I am Mars

01:35:56.680 --> 01:35:59.680
With you I is more richer than all the stars

01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:01.680
Make our wishes on our shooting stars

01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:05.680
Then for you I will play on my cosmic guitar

01:36:05.680 --> 01:36:09.680
Ladies and gentlemen, fasten your belts please

01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:14.680
Commence that with friends. I trust you enjoy this flight as much as you enjoy this act.

01:36:39.680 --> 01:36:41.680
because it's pretty funny. Pretty funny.

01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:44.680
Alright, next up in the cage match, Loki's pick for this week.

01:36:44.680 --> 01:36:46.680
Loki, what did you pick for us?

01:36:46.680 --> 01:36:50.680
I picked Rammstein's song off their new album.

01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:55.680
It's called America, and it's a nice American-hating song.

01:36:55.680 --> 01:36:58.680
And I hate America, so here we go.

01:36:58.680 --> 01:37:01.680
Alright, here's song number two, Rammstein.

01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:04.680
And I just gotta say, now wait a minute.

01:37:04.680 --> 01:37:07.680
See, Jamie puts in the song that I would expect Loki to put in,

01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:10.880
to put in and now loki is putting in the song i would expect jamie to put in

01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:14.560
what is going on when the hell is going on with the show i've played this song

01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:18.000
plenty of times on my show and i'm going to put in the song that nobody would put

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:22.400
in so here we go song number two i'm staying

01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:29.400
with America. Enjoy!

01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:25.400
For Paris, it may give out

01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:27.400
We're all

01:38:27.400 --> 01:38:28.400
We're all

01:38:28.400 --> 01:38:29.400
We're all

01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:33.400
We're all living in America

01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:35.400
America

It's one of our

01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:41.400
We're all living in America

01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:43.400
America

So, I'm going to see Becky Mauss

01:39:19.620 --> 01:39:23.620

01:39:23.620 --> 01:39:25.620
America

01:39:25.620 --> 01:39:27.620
It's Wunderbar

We're all living in America

01:39:30.620 --> 01:39:32.620
America

01:39:32.620 --> 01:39:34.620
America

01:39:34.620 --> 01:39:38.620
We're all living in America

01:39:38.620 --> 01:39:40.620
Coca-Cola

01:39:40.620 --> 01:39:42.620
On the block

01:39:42.620 --> 01:39:46.620
We're all living in America

01:39:46.620 --> 01:39:48.620
America

01:39:48.620 --> 01:39:50.620
America

01:39:50.620 --> 01:39:52.620
Chasing out another star

01:39:54.620 --> 01:39:56.620
Chasing out another star

01:39:58.620 --> 01:40:00.620
I don't think my mother's gone

01:40:00.620 --> 01:40:24.620
We're all living in America, America

01:40:24.620 --> 01:40:32.620

We're all living in America, America, America

01:40:55.620 --> 01:41:16.920
All right, that was song number two in tonight's cage match.

01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:20.860
That was Ramstein with America.

01:41:20.860 --> 01:41:21.860
Very interesting.

01:41:21.860 --> 01:41:24.380
And because I forgot to say it earlier and I forgot we're going to have a lot of new

01:41:24.380 --> 01:41:27.940
listeners now with the whole DDR Freak radio syndication. I should explain what

01:41:27.940 --> 01:41:31.660
the cage match is all about. That's where we play three songs, each host picks a

01:41:31.660 --> 01:41:36.060
song, they go head-to-head against each other, and the winning song goes into

01:41:36.060 --> 01:41:40.420
rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio Live. I'm sorry, not Orange Lounge Radio Live,

01:41:40.420 --> 01:41:43.580
Orange Lounge Radio is the Mani Music and More program, which airs 24 hours a day,

01:41:43.580 --> 01:41:48.220
7 days a week on Orange Lounge Radio. Again, the cage match kind of started as

01:41:48.220 --> 01:41:53.500
songs that would be really good in DDR, 2DX, and Damani type games, but I think

01:41:53.500 --> 01:41:56.760
just kind of turn into a clusterfuck of whatever school as I was telling Brad

01:41:56.760 --> 01:42:01.060
earlier anyway we're going to give our thoughts on those songs but of course it

01:42:01.060 --> 01:42:04.900
is up to you in the end what you think you are the ones that have the final say

01:42:04.900 --> 01:42:10.240
but we're going to give you a hint Jamie want to go first nine this is a slump

01:42:10.240 --> 01:42:19.180
sign oh you're not saying no you're saying like the number nine I'm sorry my

01:42:19.180 --> 01:42:23.080
computer is doing that see you know how on XP when you hold shift for five

01:42:23.080 --> 01:42:27.640
seconds and I hate that I'm having to turn that shit off yeah I hate that

01:42:27.640 --> 01:42:33.080
shit turn that shit off I'm turning the shift off turn on I don't want my sticky

01:42:33.080 --> 01:42:40.480
keys to come on without you know actually anything being on there I don't

01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:46.440
get the keys stick usually anyway something else anyway yeah go ahead like

01:42:46.440 --> 01:42:51.160
yourself like what should I rate it yes mmm definitely not one of the better

01:42:51.160 --> 01:42:58.160
There's better songs than Duhas that they did.

01:43:21.160 --> 01:43:26.160
I was torn between this one or Moscow, so Moscow would have been pretty good.

01:43:26.160 --> 01:43:30.160
And you don't hate Moscow nearly as much as you hate America, so you had to pick America.

01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:36.160
Well, Moscow, I had a girl that sings in it, it's like tattoo, and it's got also the...

01:43:36.160 --> 01:43:38.160
Sounds like tattoo.

01:43:38.160 --> 01:43:45.160
Yeah, and it also has accordion in the background, that kind of goes with it, it's weird, but it sounds good.

01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:58.160
Um, I don't know, every time I hear, you know, all that kind of, you know, music, I think of, like, the German greats, you know, I think of vanilla ninja, I think of, uh, Falco, David Hasselhoff, you know?

01:43:58.160 --> 01:44:01.160
I mean, so, I have to, I have to accept my hierarchy and-

01:44:01.160 --> 01:44:03.160
Is Falco the guy that's saying putting on the ritz?

01:44:03.160 --> 01:44:04.160
No, that was Taco.

01:44:04.160 --> 01:44:05.160
Oh, Taco.

01:44:05.160 --> 01:44:06.160
That was Rock Me on the Day.

01:44:06.160 --> 01:44:07.160
Rock Me on the Day.

01:44:07.160 --> 01:44:08.160
Oh my God.

01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:09.160
Taco, Taco.

01:44:09.160 --> 01:44:10.160
Damn it!

01:44:10.160 --> 01:44:11.160
Damn it!

01:44:40.160 --> 01:44:47.060
fun one to play. Umm, explicit. Well, it's a pretty interesting song, but I've heard

01:44:47.060 --> 01:44:52.740
better songs from Ramstein, so I'm gonna give it a 7 out of 10. Alright, there you have

01:44:52.740 --> 01:44:55.740
it. Alright, but it doesn't matter what we think, it's all up to what you guys think.

01:44:55.740 --> 01:45:01.700
It's no ODB, but it'll have to do. What? It's no ODB, but it'll have to do. Rest in peace,

01:45:01.700 --> 01:45:09.980
Russell Jones, AKA Dirt McGirt. AKA Big Baby Jesus, AKA Osiris. AKA me and Mariah Carey

01:45:09.980 --> 01:45:13.680
like babies and pastimes.

01:45:13.680 --> 01:45:15.680
What's your favorite ODB quote?

01:45:15.680 --> 01:45:20.680
I'm going to refrain from comments, be polite.

01:45:20.680 --> 01:45:21.680
Alright, anyway.

01:45:21.680 --> 01:45:22.680
He died last night, dude.

01:45:22.680 --> 01:45:23.680
Moving on.

01:45:23.680 --> 01:45:25.400
Yes, ODB died, he collapsed in the studio.

01:45:25.400 --> 01:45:27.400
He literally dropped dead.

01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:29.120
At the age of 35 or 36.

01:45:29.120 --> 01:45:31.600
He literally just dropped dead in the studio.

01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:35.240
No, just in the music field, prior to recording, which proves to us once again cocaine is a

01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:36.240
hell of a drug.

01:45:36.240 --> 01:45:40.240
You know he died with a 40 in his hand.

01:45:40.240 --> 01:45:44.240
And still owing like six child support payments to his baby mama.

01:45:44.240 --> 01:45:49.240
You know, he probably was dead like about 30 minutes before he actually fell to the floor.

01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:52.240
You know, it's just the cracking that was keeping him going.

01:45:52.240 --> 01:45:55.240
Can I get to my song, please?

01:45:55.240 --> 01:45:56.240
Comment, DarkCycla?

01:45:56.240 --> 01:45:58.240
I just can't...

01:45:58.240 --> 01:46:03.240
Don't feel very mournful over someone who didn't take responsibility for his children, so...

01:46:03.240 --> 01:46:04.240
I'm not the biggest fan either, but...

01:46:04.240 --> 01:46:07.700
have a forty-ounce tip in his honor so we had to uh...

01:46:07.700 --> 01:46:10.420
do something here in a bad idea

01:46:10.420 --> 01:46:11.980
anyway

01:46:11.980 --> 01:46:15.220
moving on uh... my pick

01:46:15.220 --> 01:46:19.380
probably a controversial one but i don't care because it's a top forty songs that

01:46:19.380 --> 01:46:20.780
i'm putting in tonight

01:46:20.780 --> 01:46:24.060
and usually we don't put in top forty songs but i swear to god

01:46:24.060 --> 01:46:28.820
this song is so danceable and it's so eighties i love this song

01:46:28.820 --> 01:46:31.240
it's so awesome

01:46:31.240 --> 01:46:37.240
I'm just going to say it, it is Gwen Stefani, and the song is What You Waitin' For, hoe?

01:46:37.240 --> 01:46:42.240
Alright, and here it is, enjoy, I think this song will be perfect for DDR, you be the judge.

01:46:42.240 --> 01:46:46.400
number three, Gwen Stefani, What You Waiting For. Enjoy.

01:47:12.240 --> 01:47:16.200
Yeah, I-I-I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I,

01:47:16.200 --> 01:47:19.960
I'm like a kid who needs to fit a moving car.

01:47:19.960 --> 01:47:23.800
Scary conversation, shit my eyes, can't find a break.

01:47:23.800 --> 01:47:27.020
What if they say that you're a clobber?

01:47:27.020 --> 01:47:30.220
And actually, I'm worried if I do it alone.

01:47:30.220 --> 01:47:34.160
Who really cares, cause if you laugh you never know it could be great.

01:47:34.160 --> 01:47:37.180
Take a chance, cause you might grow.

01:47:37.180 --> 01:47:41.580
Ooh, oh, oh...

01:47:41.580 --> 01:47:47.800
what you waiting, what you waiting, what you waiting, what you waiting, what you waiting for

01:47:48.840 --> 01:47:54.420
what you waiting, what you waiting, what you waiting, what you waiting, what you waiting for

01:47:54.900 --> 01:47:59.020
come on take it back, take it back, take it back, take it back

01:47:59.020 --> 01:48:02.320
i want the chance to know it all

01:48:02.320 --> 01:48:05.540
like your boots is that you're repeating yourself

01:48:05.540 --> 01:48:09.340
you knew it all by yourself, while you're standing in one place

01:48:09.340 --> 01:48:13.340
I'm going to floss, I'm going to carry you

01:48:13.340 --> 01:48:16.340
You know you don't deserve your things from the zone

01:48:16.340 --> 01:48:19.340
I know it's a mess, that's how a society all fits

01:48:19.340 --> 01:48:23.340
We should let this show you're capable

01:48:28.340 --> 01:48:31.340
And look at your watch now

01:48:31.340 --> 01:48:35.340
You're still a super hot female

01:48:35.340 --> 01:48:38.340
You bet your million dollar contract

01:48:38.340 --> 01:48:41.340
And never waited for your heart attack

01:48:41.340 --> 01:48:55.340
Oh, what you waiting, what you waiting, what you waiting, what you waiting, what you waiting for?

01:48:55.340 --> 01:49:00.340
I can't wait to go

01:49:00.340 --> 01:49:04.340
Back into Japan

01:49:04.340 --> 01:49:09.340
Give me lots of brand new fans

01:49:09.340 --> 01:49:14.340
Osaka, Tokyo

01:49:14.340 --> 01:49:18.340
Your hair is shook, good girl

01:49:18.340 --> 01:49:23.340
Damn, you've got the wicked style

01:49:25.340 --> 01:49:28.340
Look at your watch now

01:49:28.340 --> 01:49:31.340
You're still a supermodel female

01:49:31.340 --> 01:49:37.880
You've got your million-dollar contract And they're all waiting for your lunch at it

01:49:37.880 --> 01:49:57.900
And what you waiting, what you waiting, what you waiting, what you waiting, what you waiting for?

01:50:27.900 --> 01:50:33.680
Alright, that was song number three in tonight's cage match. Gwen Stefani, what you waiting

01:50:33.680 --> 01:50:39.120
for? And I can tell you right now, we waiting for Jamie. Oh, here she comes. Jamie, I know

01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:46.900
you were gone for part of that. What did you think? It's too happy. It's a happy, too happy

01:50:46.900 --> 01:50:54.060
seven. Yeah, it's a happy shiny seven. Happy shiny seven. Alright, lanky seven. Or is it

01:50:54.060 --> 01:51:14.060
I like that song a lot. I actually didn't hear that she was going solo until really recently and then all of a sudden here's her song and I was kind of like, eh, not a big surprise the sound style she took. It's kind of cliche, but it's still cool. I like it. Dancy. Good stuff.

01:51:14.060 --> 01:51:15.060
Oscar, I want to know.

01:51:15.060 --> 01:51:19.060
Oh, sorry. I'd say probably an 8.5.

01:51:19.060 --> 01:51:20.060
5?

01:51:20.060 --> 01:51:21.060
Let me go there.

01:51:21.060 --> 01:51:22.060
Loki!

01:51:22.060 --> 01:51:27.740
Um, well, there's two things that that song was lacking.

01:51:27.740 --> 01:51:32.100
Number one, well actually one thing that I didn't like about it, it was top 40.

01:51:32.100 --> 01:51:34.580
Number two, it did not have any English in it.

01:51:34.580 --> 01:51:36.040
There's no English in that song.

01:51:36.040 --> 01:51:38.460
The other two songs featured English.

01:51:38.460 --> 01:51:39.460
That song had none.

01:51:39.460 --> 01:51:41.460
Therefore, it gets a 6.

01:51:41.460 --> 01:51:42.460
Blow-walk.

01:51:42.460 --> 01:51:45.160
Um, I like it.

01:51:45.160 --> 01:51:49.880
I think it's kind of doubled on the fact that I think the video for it was actually very cool and

01:51:50.120 --> 01:51:53.040
ever since watching that video I too would like to

01:51:53.640 --> 01:51:56.720
Find a way to express how a giraffe does sound

01:51:57.400 --> 01:52:01.520
Because like in the before it does I haven't seen the video like she's trying to get inspiration

01:52:01.520 --> 01:52:05.160
So she goes to like some clinic or whatever they give her a survey and one of the questions

01:52:05.160 --> 01:52:09.840
She has to answer is in your best way possible describe write out what the sound of giraffe makes

01:52:09.840 --> 01:52:18.840
But I think it's really a bounce. Definitely a pretty cool song. It's very reminiscent of like I would say probably mid 80's production of Debbie Harry.

01:52:18.840 --> 01:52:24.840
So I can totally get with that and this is one of those times where I do have to give out double digits. A 10 for me.

01:52:24.840 --> 01:52:29.840
Wow. I gotta say, you know what? That song just makes me want to shake my booty and spank yours.

01:52:33.840 --> 01:52:34.840
Give it a 5.

01:52:34.840 --> 01:52:36.840
I give it a 9 and a half.

01:52:36.840 --> 01:52:37.880
uh...

01:52:37.880 --> 01:52:41.920
explicit

01:52:41.920 --> 01:52:45.520
well i don't really like the song, i like how Gwen Stefani went

01:52:45.520 --> 01:52:46.680
to the direction

01:52:46.680 --> 01:52:49.240
that had more of like an 80's

01:52:49.240 --> 01:52:51.240
kind of background

01:52:51.240 --> 01:52:55.440
but at the same time i don't know, maybe i'm not used to her music

01:52:55.440 --> 01:52:58.160
for that type of direction

01:52:58.160 --> 01:53:00.000
so i'd probably give it uh...

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.560
that's a pretty good song, so i'd give it an 8.5

01:53:02.560 --> 01:53:08.560
might as well be because of the sky is about as big as it has, so I'm going to play 5 for you.

01:53:08.560 --> 01:53:12.560
Alright, well good thing it's not up to these guys. It's up to you guys in the chat room.

01:53:12.560 --> 01:53:16.560
Here's a recap and then you can vote. Here is song number one you can vote for tonight.

01:53:16.560 --> 01:53:18.560
Zladd, electronic supersonic.

01:53:18.560 --> 01:53:23.560
Rocket, you know need put money in my pocket.

01:53:23.560 --> 01:53:27.560
The door is closed, I just lock it.

01:53:27.560 --> 01:53:30.560
I put my gold plug in your socket.

01:53:30.560 --> 01:53:34.560
Song number two you can vote for tonight is Ramstein with America.

01:53:34.560 --> 01:54:02.880
And song number three you can vote for tonight is Gwen Stefani, Whatchu Waitin' For?

01:54:02.880 --> 01:54:08.480
Please vote now! Send a private message to Sky in the chatroom with your vote. Song number

01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:15.520
1, song number 2, or song number 3! Loki, tell us what's going on in the sim scene this

01:54:15.520 --> 01:54:25.100
week. Nada. Um, I think I mentioned last week, um, what was it? Release Candidate 2 of Step

01:54:25.100 --> 01:54:30.480
Mania came out, and other than that, there's really only thing that's worth mentioning

01:54:30.480 --> 01:54:34.840
is there's a contest, a theme contest that's going on. With all the themes that have been

01:54:34.840 --> 01:54:41.200
made this year, they're trying to get DDR Maniac's theme of 2004. With, you know, many

01:54:41.200 --> 01:54:47.160
in the running like, no, Technofeen, which is in the lead, and some other ones that are

01:54:47.160 --> 01:54:54.280
on there, or, yeah, Technofeen. Anyways, Technolize, Technofeen, I can't remember what it's called.

01:54:54.280 --> 01:55:04.280
Anyways, so yeah, those are worth checking out. I know Technolize is working on version 3.0, which is supposed to be, like, completely redone.

01:55:04.280 --> 01:55:11.280
It's still nice looking. And then, other than that, really not too much going on right now.

01:55:11.280 --> 01:55:23.280
I've been checking out this week, actually, BMS sim files. For those who don't know what those are, those are the homemade key-sounded BeatMania 2DX sim files

01:55:23.280 --> 01:55:28.600
Sim files that are out there and I mean there's really still a lot of talented artists out there that you have working on these things

01:55:29.560 --> 01:55:35.460
The ones I've been checking out though have been by Yama Jet, which is also featured in Food Mix and Food Mix Plus

01:55:36.120 --> 01:55:37.520
There's some pretty cool stuff

01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:42.040
I wanted to play on the show, but I can't because the volumes all fucked up on it

01:55:42.040 --> 01:55:43.200
So I gotta go fix those

01:55:43.200 --> 01:55:49.320
But there's one that was a remix of We Will Rock You called I Will Rock You and it was really cool

01:55:49.320 --> 01:55:53.480
actually very cool they turned into a house the song which is pretty neat and

01:55:53.480 --> 01:56:00.000
then I have a remix of the fall that's on there and there's also paranoia Delta

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:06.160
but that one's too much noise for the it's like too grungy so not worth

01:56:06.160 --> 01:56:09.900
playing on the show but you can find those there's some files out there for

01:56:09.900 --> 01:56:17.420
them also one that was pointed out and I found would be it was cigaru 180 which

01:56:17.420 --> 01:56:25.420
was by this, the only Russian Bimani remixer that I've seen. It's actually pretty cool.

01:56:25.420 --> 01:56:31.460
We might be able to play that later. But those are pretty much all that's really going on.

01:56:31.460 --> 01:56:35.260
How long is it? It's only like a minute and fifty, right? Yeah, it's not that long. But

01:56:35.260 --> 01:56:38.340
oh, the other thing I was going to mention that's working on, obviously being worked

01:56:38.340 --> 01:56:43.540
on right now, is Dance of the Stage of Fusion's N-Files on DDRUK. Queue it up, let's hear

01:56:43.540 --> 01:56:45.580
the, let's hear the Subaru remix, because I heard a little bit of it, and I actually

01:56:45.580 --> 01:56:51.280
really liked it too. So let's let our listeners hear a little bit of it. Again, if you enjoy

01:56:51.280 --> 01:56:57.120
Bomani remixes, then might I urge you to tune in to Diversion, the Orange Launch Radio Remix

01:56:57.120 --> 01:57:01.880
Show, which airs every Monday night at 7 o'clock Pacific Standard Time on our station. Check

01:57:01.880 --> 01:57:07.020
it out. And of course, this week will be the first question in that show for the Akira

01:57:07.020 --> 01:57:11.800
Yomoka signed CD contest. If you're just joining us, check out our website, www.orangelaunchradio.com

01:57:11.800 --> 01:57:16.740
for all the details. Okay, here it is. Loki's going to spin this for us. What's this remix

01:57:16.740 --> 01:57:24.640
called again? It's Zagaru180 and the guy that remixed it, his name is Vospy. And he's got

01:57:24.640 --> 01:57:29.600
his own site. I really have to search hard to find it. He's a member on DDRUK. He does

01:57:29.600 --> 01:57:36.800
a lot of stuff with the Pump It Up scene over there, I guess. But, yeah, Zagaru180. It's

01:57:36.800 --> 01:57:38.920
It's only about a little over two minutes.

01:57:38.920 --> 01:57:39.920
So here we go.

01:57:39.920 --> 01:57:42.920
And I check this out.

01:57:42.920 --> 01:57:46.940
The

01:57:46.940 --> 01:57:50.740
the

01:57:50.740 --> 01:57:52.340
the

01:57:52.340 --> 01:57:54.340
the

01:57:54.340 --> 01:58:01.620
the

01:58:01.620 --> 01:58:06.240
of

01:58:06.240 --> 01:58:08.900
the

01:59:38.900 --> 02:00:01.900
I'm out of practice and my hand cramps up pretty quick.

02:00:01.900 --> 02:00:09.260
So, I must mean you're getting, you know, some action then, because you haven't been

02:00:09.260 --> 02:00:10.260
taking care of yourself.

02:00:10.260 --> 02:00:11.260
If your hand, you're not...

02:00:11.260 --> 02:00:14.260
No, my wrist is fine, my hand, that's not...

02:00:14.260 --> 02:00:17.380
He said his wrist is fine, it's his hand that's not.

02:00:17.380 --> 02:00:18.380
Anyway...

02:00:18.380 --> 02:00:19.380
I see.

02:00:19.380 --> 02:00:22.660
Alright, let's get to the winner of tonight's cage match, shall we?

02:00:22.660 --> 02:00:24.660
We took some votes while that song was on.

02:00:24.660 --> 02:00:26.140
You guys ready to hear tonight's winner?

02:00:26.140 --> 02:00:27.780
What do you guys think won?

02:00:27.780 --> 02:00:28.780
I always poll.

02:00:28.780 --> 02:00:31.500
I would say the third song, definitely won.

02:00:31.500 --> 02:00:42.180
let's see if it was a shocker tonight. Tonight's winner was not a shocker. It was close, though.

02:00:42.180 --> 02:00:43.180
The votes were very-

02:00:43.180 --> 02:00:47.100
I'm singing up the worst piece of shit I can find next week.

02:00:47.100 --> 02:00:52.680
Hey, sing the song. And I remind you, you just had a song retired. It's time to let

02:00:52.680 --> 02:00:58.500
Jamie and I bounce some back and forth for a little while, so. All right. So there you

02:00:58.500 --> 02:01:04.060
So, my song wins tonight and Jamie and Loki bring new songs to the table next week.

02:01:04.060 --> 02:01:09.220
Alright, before we go to a break, and I know we want to get to the FUs of the evening probably

02:01:09.220 --> 02:01:12.020
when we come back from the next break, but I wanted to give mention to this.

02:01:12.020 --> 02:01:14.940
This is pretty big Bomani news we haven't gotten to yet.

02:01:14.940 --> 02:01:17.940
Guitar Freaks and Drummania are getting a makeover.

02:01:17.940 --> 02:01:20.300
Loki, you've probably read up more on this than I have.

02:01:20.300 --> 02:01:22.940
What do you know about the new Guitar Freaks and Drummania?

02:01:22.940 --> 02:01:27.340
All I know about it is it's V, and not the song, but it's V.

02:01:27.340 --> 02:01:34.340
Guitar Freaks and Drummania V. V standing for Vest. That still doesn't make any sense though.

02:01:34.340 --> 02:01:38.340
But, what the theme is going to be for this release is going to be gears and machinery.

02:01:38.340 --> 02:01:41.340
So you're going to see some pretty kick-ass interfaces at least.

02:01:41.340 --> 02:01:46.340
The revamping, I guess the results screen is supposed to be more 3D or something like that.

02:01:46.340 --> 02:01:47.340
God knows what they're going to do with that.

02:01:47.340 --> 02:01:51.340
The movies that are going to be playing during it, it's going to be something similar to 2DX,

02:01:51.340 --> 02:01:54.340
where you're going to see full motion video and stuff like that.

02:01:54.340 --> 02:01:56.340
That means a hardware upgrade.

02:01:56.340 --> 02:02:01.500
it's going to be a hardware upgrade, yes. It's going to be just like 2DX 10 style in

02:02:01.500 --> 02:02:07.980
red. It's going to be running off of a PC-like hardware system. Another thing that they were

02:02:07.980 --> 02:02:12.860
saying that's supposed to be in there is about 230 songs starting, I think. And that's not

02:02:12.860 --> 02:02:18.860
including, I think, the unlocks from, you know, obviously the EMEA stuff. Other than

02:02:18.860 --> 02:02:25.900
that, really not much else other than they mentioned a few songs on, for test locations,

02:02:25.900 --> 02:02:29.780
I know that we're on there and some licensed stuff.

02:02:29.780 --> 02:02:34.800
One song that's being pointed out in our chat room specifically by Dark LionXVI says Miserylou,

02:02:34.800 --> 02:02:37.260
which was the theme from Pulp Fiction.

02:02:37.260 --> 02:02:38.260
Miserylou.

02:02:38.260 --> 02:02:39.260
Oh, Miserylou.

02:02:39.260 --> 02:02:40.260
I'm white, okay.

02:02:40.260 --> 02:02:41.260
Miserylou.

02:02:41.260 --> 02:02:42.260
No.

02:02:42.260 --> 02:02:43.260
Is it?

02:02:43.260 --> 02:02:44.260
No.

02:02:44.260 --> 02:02:45.260
Read the letters.

02:02:45.260 --> 02:02:46.260
Sound it out.

02:02:46.260 --> 02:02:47.260
Miserylou.

02:02:47.260 --> 02:02:48.260
No, there's nothing between the R and the L.

02:02:48.260 --> 02:02:49.260
Ah, shut up.

02:02:49.260 --> 02:02:50.260
God.

02:02:50.260 --> 02:02:51.260
I don't care.

02:02:51.260 --> 02:02:52.260
It's a theme from Pulp Fiction.

02:02:52.260 --> 02:02:53.260
That's the bottom line.

02:02:53.260 --> 02:02:54.260
We all know that song.

02:02:54.260 --> 02:02:55.260
Dude, turn your phone off, dude.

02:02:55.260 --> 02:02:57.260
I have to turn off your phone for this show.

02:03:25.260 --> 02:03:27.260
Going Up by Colors

02:03:27.260 --> 02:03:31.260
I just want to say it's awesome that there's a band called Pooh in Guitar Freaks and Drummania.

02:03:31.260 --> 02:03:35.260
What song are you going to play? Pooh?

02:03:35.260 --> 02:03:42.260
And as we were mentioning before, Miseraloo is Spaghetti Surfers,

02:03:42.260 --> 02:03:50.260
Wild Challenger by Jindo, NGS by Asian Kung Fu Generation,

02:03:50.260 --> 02:03:56.260
Nocturne number 9 sounds like, you know, number 9, but by some Japanese group here.

02:03:56.260 --> 02:04:02.260
And the extra stage will be Heaven's Cocktail.

02:04:02.260 --> 02:04:05.260
My big five.

02:04:05.260 --> 02:04:10.260
And Heaven's Cocktail.

02:04:10.260 --> 02:04:15.260
Do you get one of those cool little umbrella things with it too?

02:04:15.260 --> 02:04:19.140
But anyways, so yeah, that's kind of what's going on.

02:04:19.140 --> 02:04:25.740
Linked to the Konami test page or whatever on OrangeLawnsRadio.com.

02:04:25.740 --> 02:04:29.140
So if you can read Japanese, you'll definitely get a kick out of this site.

02:04:29.140 --> 02:04:30.140
Also...

02:04:30.140 --> 02:04:31.140
Pictures!

02:04:31.140 --> 02:04:32.140
Pictures are on the page!

02:04:32.140 --> 02:04:33.140
Oh okay, cool.

02:04:33.140 --> 02:04:35.680
I also can't remember if we linked to this or not, I don't, I actually don't think I

02:04:35.680 --> 02:04:38.100
ran a story on it, I'm going to have to tomorrow.

02:04:38.100 --> 02:04:44.060
I did pick wind though that Konami is doing another survey, remember how they did a big

02:04:44.060 --> 02:04:49.080
They're putting their feelers out there for a 2d x7 style. Well this time the game they're taking surveys for

02:04:49.820 --> 02:04:52.340
karaoke revolution bamani edition

02:04:53.380 --> 02:05:00.140
There in Japan they are putting out the feelers right now for a karaoke revolution edition with all bamani songs in it

02:05:00.700 --> 02:05:07.300
Wouldn't that be something else? It'd just be like watching a DDR third mix all over again. Seriously. That's basically what it is

02:05:08.020 --> 02:05:11.000
More info on that to follow. We don't have to know a whole lot about that right now

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.840
Now all we know is that I think they were looking for three thousand which isn't a very

02:05:13.840 --> 02:05:14.840
big number.

02:05:14.840 --> 02:05:19.280
So it looks like that will probably happen, the Karaoke Revolution, Bomani edition.

02:05:19.280 --> 02:05:21.640
And for some people it will finally be an excuse for them to play.

02:05:21.640 --> 02:05:26.400
And maybe those kids that were trying to get Murmur Twins in Karaoke Revolution will finally

02:05:26.400 --> 02:05:27.400
get their way.

02:05:27.400 --> 02:05:31.400
Which would be very interesting, I think, if Murmur Twins made it in there.

02:05:31.400 --> 02:05:34.400
I'll have to see.

02:05:34.400 --> 02:05:45.400
need to put this in here. Um, what was that, uh, uh, Naha and, uh, Gachukun. That'd be

02:05:45.400 --> 02:05:51.840
great. Um, yeah, so, there's not too much going on. We're still waiting to hear more

02:05:51.840 --> 02:05:55.440
about Dancing Stage Fusion, the arcade mix, because that's going to be the huge news to

02:05:55.440 --> 02:06:01.240
come out. Because, you know, if Europe's doing it, then, well, guess what, the hardware's

02:06:01.240 --> 02:06:06.240
All they have to do is make the game. Or another game for another region.

02:06:06.240 --> 02:06:11.240
I'm surprised that we're not seeing a new arcade mix for Japan.

02:06:11.240 --> 02:06:16.240
It's not that hard to make it once the hardware is done or whatever.

02:06:16.240 --> 02:06:21.240
So it'll be interesting. At least maybe we'll see some arcades import that over here.

02:06:21.240 --> 02:06:26.240
Because they'll get desperate and not wanting to wait any longer.

02:06:26.240 --> 02:06:27.240
So, yeah.

02:06:27.240 --> 02:06:46.660
Yeah, DDR Extreme Plus, or the so-called NICS that they claim is new, is actually on CCL,

02:06:46.660 --> 02:06:47.660
Country Cub Lanes.

02:06:47.660 --> 02:06:48.660
Interesting.

02:06:48.660 --> 02:06:50.480
Our local bowling alley, where DDR was born here in Sacramento.

02:06:50.480 --> 02:06:51.480
Very interesting.

02:06:51.480 --> 02:06:52.840
I kind of want to check that out.

02:06:52.840 --> 02:06:56.640
You know what's very cool about Country Club Lanes here in Sacramento, our bowling alley

02:06:56.640 --> 02:06:59.080
where DDR was born here in this area?

02:06:59.080 --> 02:07:02.600
It's 24 hours, which makes it very cool for DDR, since it's open 24 hours.

02:07:02.600 --> 02:07:05.400
Yeah, but there are still those nights you have to pay the cover charge to get in.

02:07:05.400 --> 02:07:06.400
That's very true.

02:07:06.400 --> 02:07:07.400
That's very true.

02:07:07.400 --> 02:07:09.440
And that sucks.

02:07:09.440 --> 02:07:14.600
I remember, I mean, back in the day, you used to hang out, like, till midnight and go play

02:07:14.600 --> 02:07:17.560
DDR till 3 in the morning.

02:07:17.560 --> 02:07:19.800
I remember the days of glow bowling.

02:07:19.800 --> 02:07:21.960
I remember the days where we would go...

02:07:21.960 --> 02:07:25.480
seriously need to go global and remember back in the day right when Rocky Horror

02:07:25.480 --> 02:07:29.720
first died and the sacramentals were coming together you and me and melody

02:07:29.720 --> 02:07:37.160
all went yes I do remember that like quite and we were like tired I remember

02:07:37.160 --> 02:07:39.920
going and we go and then we played DDR and that was back when they still had I

02:07:39.920 --> 02:07:44.400
think 1.5 makes I see I seem to recall that that I remember being assaulted on

02:07:44.400 --> 02:07:48.560
the 1.5 machine yeah oh it's fun good time I think when we went it was

02:07:48.560 --> 02:07:53.720
actually up to a fifth mix at the time yeah yeah that that junk guy came and

02:07:53.720 --> 02:07:58.280
tried to take a swing at me while I was playing oh I remember that and I posted

02:07:58.280 --> 02:08:04.880
it had to have been a page and a half in word and posted it on DDR freak and they

02:08:04.880 --> 02:08:08.360
got so much bad press from it and I talked to the manager the next that was

02:08:08.360 --> 02:08:13.320
awesome yeah and they had security guards there afterwards you better have

02:08:13.320 --> 02:08:17.040
your best face on when Jamie comes down which comes to your arcade I believe in

02:08:17.040 --> 02:08:24.600
good service, thank you. Good memories there. Any location that has 24 hour DDR is fun.

02:08:24.600 --> 02:08:30.920
Any place now is completely at my mercy now that I've got my business law book. Because

02:08:30.920 --> 02:08:38.140
now I could have sued them for not providing, for not fulfilling their duty of utmost care.

02:08:38.140 --> 02:08:43.560
Don't mess with her, she got a law book now. Damn. So very interesting though, going back

02:08:43.560 --> 02:08:47.760
to the fact that Dancing Stage Fusion is going to be having a brand new cabinet coming out

02:08:47.760 --> 02:08:51.200
could be a very good sign for DDR, could be just a red herring, who knows?

02:08:51.200 --> 02:08:52.200
Well, you never know.

02:08:52.200 --> 02:08:54.880
I mean, also, you've got to think of it like this.

02:08:54.880 --> 02:08:58.560
When they did DDR Extreme, they even mentioned as much like in concert, I believe, they said

02:08:58.560 --> 02:09:02.680
they had to take a break from DDR because, you know, for whatever reason, and it was

02:09:02.680 --> 02:09:07.320
at the point where they had created the DDR mix like once a year, practically, and sometimes

02:09:07.320 --> 02:09:08.320
you just got to...

02:09:08.320 --> 02:09:09.320
Yeah, it was like...

02:09:09.320 --> 02:09:11.520
I think we got like fourth and fifth mix in the same year.

02:09:11.520 --> 02:09:16.520
Oh yeah, you had 4th, and then you had 4th Plus come out, and then 5th was shortly thereafter.

02:09:16.520 --> 02:09:19.520
Yeah, it was like 4th, 4th Plus, and then like 5th and Max came out in the same year, I think.

02:09:19.520 --> 02:09:23.520
Yeah, so I think it was, you know, long overdue, at least just for a little time off.

02:09:23.520 --> 02:09:27.520
So it wouldn't surprise me the least bit to see a new DDR come out.

02:09:27.520 --> 02:09:30.520
I mean, you know, that's just how it works.

02:09:30.520 --> 02:09:32.520
I mean, it's probably a good thing they took a break.

02:09:32.520 --> 02:09:37.520
I mean, I'd like to see them take that break, you know, from almost every series, you know, once in a while.

02:09:37.520 --> 02:09:43.380
Because you're looking, I think, seeing how 2DX and Guitar Freaks and Drummania have been

02:09:43.380 --> 02:09:45.800
cranking out babies and all that kind of stuff.

02:09:45.800 --> 02:09:48.800
I think it's a good thing that Guitar Freaks and Drummania is getting an overhaul, though.

02:09:48.800 --> 02:09:51.400
Because honestly, it was getting to a point when they got, like, what are they on, like

02:09:51.400 --> 02:09:52.480
11th mix now?

02:09:52.480 --> 02:09:53.480
I just...

02:09:53.480 --> 02:09:57.040
Yeah, it's been the same damn game since 5th mix, just with different songs.

02:09:57.040 --> 02:10:01.020
It's kind of got to the point where it's like, oh, Guitar Freaks is getting a new mix, must

02:10:01.020 --> 02:10:02.020
be Monday.

02:10:02.020 --> 02:10:03.020
You know, it's like...

02:10:03.020 --> 02:10:05.880
Seriously, it's kind of getting to the point where it's getting a little stale, so I'm

02:10:05.880 --> 02:10:10.000
I'm kind of glad to see they're giving that series a swift kick in the butt, and 2DX getting

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:11.160
a swift kick in the butt.

02:10:11.160 --> 02:10:14.680
I hope that, logically, DDR is going to be the next series now that's getting a swift

02:10:14.680 --> 02:10:17.120
kick in the butt, and is getting overhauled.

02:10:17.120 --> 02:10:20.720
But what I wanted to say, now, Dancy Stage Fusion, that is Europe's version of Ultra

02:10:20.720 --> 02:10:21.720
Mix, right?

02:10:21.720 --> 02:10:22.720
Correct.

02:10:22.720 --> 02:10:25.360
Does this mean that DDR Hawaii could be involved?

02:10:25.360 --> 02:10:26.360
DDR1?

02:10:26.360 --> 02:10:27.360
DDR Hawaii.

02:10:27.360 --> 02:10:28.360
Oh, DDR Hawaii?

02:10:28.360 --> 02:10:29.360
Or KTH.

02:10:29.360 --> 02:10:30.360
Well, usually...

02:10:30.360 --> 02:10:31.360
Sorry.

02:10:31.360 --> 02:10:38.480
Usually, I'm not sure about arcade mixes because as far as, I mean, as far as like say home

02:10:38.480 --> 02:10:44.620
console versions, like Kset I believe does, like there's actually the AM division is different

02:10:44.620 --> 02:10:46.320
than the console division.

02:10:46.320 --> 02:10:50.240
So I mean, as far as like programming, all that kind of stuff, Hawaii doesn't really

02:10:50.240 --> 02:10:54.280
have that much say I don't think as far as arcade releases, as far as like home version,

02:10:54.280 --> 02:10:56.120
of course they got the lockdown on that.

02:10:56.120 --> 02:10:57.120
Interesting.

02:10:57.120 --> 02:11:02.040
Well, it will be interesting to see what happens, because a lot of people, just with the developments

02:11:02.040 --> 02:11:07.120
with UltraMix II and the license, they said, you know, I've heard people say this, if DDR

02:11:07.120 --> 02:11:10.160
comes out again in the USA, Hawaii needs to be involved.

02:11:10.160 --> 02:11:13.640
Hawaii definitely needs to be involved, which is amazing considering that UltraMix II hasn't

02:11:13.640 --> 02:11:14.640
even come out yet.

02:11:14.640 --> 02:11:15.640
But, we'll see.

02:11:15.640 --> 02:11:19.880
Yeah, it's, I mean, there's a lot of things going into UltraMix II that are different.

02:11:19.880 --> 02:11:23.640
You know, obviously, you know, some people give, you know, Hawaii credit for, of course,

02:11:23.640 --> 02:11:25.320
going kind of a slightly different direction.

02:11:25.320 --> 02:11:34.320
Some people can point out to the fact that this time they got even more DDR knowledgeable people to QA and not only that, work on step data.

02:11:34.320 --> 02:11:41.320
So this is very much like fans having even more, or like players having more of a say into what goes into a game.

02:11:41.320 --> 02:11:51.320
If that's the direction how DDR as far as the Ultramix franchise is concerned, then it's definitely going to have its own identity very shortly.

02:11:51.320 --> 02:11:54.320
People will see that as soon as they get it.

02:11:54.320 --> 02:11:59.020
Very good. Alright. I guess what we're going to do now, I think now is a good time to take

02:11:59.020 --> 02:12:02.360
a break, and when we come back we're going to get into the FUs of the week. So if you

02:12:02.360 --> 02:12:06.860
want to send some FUs in over private message to Sky in the chat room, we will make sure

02:12:06.860 --> 02:12:10.600
we get those read on air for you. We're going to continue to play some full-length versions

02:12:10.600 --> 02:12:15.040
that we found on the internet of brand new UltraMix 2 songs, and this one should take

02:12:15.040 --> 02:12:18.640
you back. This is one I did not recognize until I actually listened to it. I did not

02:12:18.640 --> 02:12:21.720
recognize it by the name, but then when I started listening to it, I'm like, oh my god,

02:12:21.720 --> 02:12:27.360
song this is don't stop by the freestylers enjoy this is going to be an

02:12:27.360 --> 02:12:34.360
in UltraMix 2. Enjoy. We'll be back. Orange Lounge Radio.

02:12:57.360 --> 02:13:22.480
Look, you are gonna want me, that's who you want me, it might be a different show of

02:13:22.480 --> 02:13:24.480
It might be a different story

02:13:31.480 --> 02:13:34.480
You, you probably wanna go

02:13:34.480 --> 02:13:36.480
Up where you wanna go

02:13:36.480 --> 02:13:38.480
It might be a different story

02:13:46.480 --> 02:13:49.480
You, you probably wanna go

02:13:49.480 --> 02:13:51.480
Up where you wanna go

go the fuck, get down

02:15:14.700 --> 02:15:30.320
Keep your body, keep your body, keep your body away now

02:16:30.320 --> 02:16:58.480

I do marathon stuff.

02:17:40.040 --> 02:17:41.040
That's right.

02:17:41.040 --> 02:17:44.080
Didn't you marathon Eddie Izzard the other day?

02:17:44.080 --> 02:17:49.160
Last week I did the Shambad Sings again.

02:17:49.160 --> 02:17:50.160
Oh yes.

02:17:50.160 --> 02:17:51.680
I actually tuned in for part of that.

02:17:51.680 --> 02:17:52.680
I heard some of that.

02:17:52.680 --> 02:17:53.680
It was pretty good.

02:17:53.680 --> 02:17:54.680
Other stuff.

02:17:54.680 --> 02:17:55.680
Good stuff.

02:17:55.680 --> 02:17:59.680
We're going to be now, not going to be the Orange Lounge Radio Rewind anymore since those

02:17:59.680 --> 02:18:01.520
are moving over to The Freak.

02:18:01.520 --> 02:18:07.160
It's going to be the classic, moldy episodes, freshly fermented for your listening pleasure,

02:18:07.160 --> 02:18:10.480
year old episodes of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:18:10.480 --> 02:18:17.160
And Thursday nights on this station, outside the box, my program dedicated to all that

02:18:17.160 --> 02:18:18.920
other random video game stuff.

02:18:18.920 --> 02:18:21.600
So definitely check it out if you haven't yet.

02:18:21.600 --> 02:18:26.260
Now we must get to one of those Orange Lounge Radio Live staples, that thing we have to

02:18:26.260 --> 02:18:29.760
do every week where we get out that angst, and for those of you guys that are new to

02:18:29.760 --> 02:18:33.160
this program, I know there might be some of you guys that are listening to this on DER

02:18:33.160 --> 02:18:36.600
Free Radio for the first time, those of you guys that are new to the program are going

02:18:36.600 --> 02:18:41.680
to hear this every week, the FUs of the week, and Jamie, why is it that we have to do these

02:18:41.680 --> 02:18:44.460
FUs of the week every single week?

02:18:44.460 --> 02:18:48.460
Because we're not going to take it anymore.

02:18:48.460 --> 02:19:08.260
The first SU goes to my allergies for flaring up, the second goes to Ben and Joel for making

02:19:08.260 --> 02:19:09.260
me sleepy.

02:19:09.260 --> 02:19:17.420
Also, for some reason my jaw hurts, like the joints in my jaw, yeah I've got all this

02:19:17.420 --> 02:19:21.420
that is pressure in my head. That means that I'm likely going to bed early.

02:19:21.420 --> 02:19:25.420
I don't drink carefully, nor do I have any at the house.

02:19:25.420 --> 02:19:29.420
I have prescription drugs that are doing shit.

02:19:29.420 --> 02:19:33.420
Um, but I'm probably going to be going to sleep early tonight.

02:19:33.420 --> 02:19:37.420
Um, a big F-you

02:19:37.420 --> 02:19:41.420
toward having to work on this ethics project.

02:19:41.420 --> 02:20:05.360
p0k3smot42o

02:20:05.360 --> 02:20:10.360
for being in a big feeding frenzy so that I'd trip over her while wearing clocks in the kitchen

02:20:10.360 --> 02:20:12.360
last Sunday

02:20:12.360 --> 02:20:18.360
and just, in general, just massive FUs to just about everything

02:20:18.360 --> 02:20:21.360
I think that will cover everything

02:20:21.360 --> 02:20:24.360
Alright, Loki, your turn

02:20:27.360 --> 02:20:32.360
Oh my god, you know, as if I don't complain about them enough

02:20:32.360 --> 02:20:39.360
Yay! You did it again, Comcast! You just find a way to fuck everything up again!

02:20:39.360 --> 02:20:40.360
Way to go, G4!

02:20:40.360 --> 02:20:46.360
Because you know what? There wasn't quite enough crap on there yet, so you had to get rid of the, like, good stuff.

02:20:46.360 --> 02:20:48.360
You know, the fit more crap in there.

02:20:48.360 --> 02:20:55.360
I'm sorry for all those people that used to be part of TechTV that got sucked into G4 and then fired.

02:20:55.360 --> 02:20:57.360
Because you're talented.

02:20:57.360 --> 02:21:01.360
Well, you know what? They don't want to make G4 look bad, so guess what?

02:21:01.360 --> 02:21:06.520
Bye bye, bye bye screensavers, bye bye unscrewed, yeah screensavers will still be there but

02:21:06.520 --> 02:21:08.960
it ain't screensavers anymore.

02:21:08.960 --> 02:21:13.320
And you know what, I'm, and know what sucks too is I heard that the people, actually some

02:21:13.320 --> 02:21:17.240
of the good shows on G4 like Cheat and stuff, oh those guys got fired too!

02:21:17.240 --> 02:21:18.240
So guess what?

02:21:18.240 --> 02:21:22.800
You know, the hell with all the good stuff on G4, I will not be watching G4 anymore unless

02:21:22.800 --> 02:21:27.440
to catch the last episode of Unscrewed if they ever air it, that'll be the only time

02:21:27.440 --> 02:21:29.320
and the last time I watch G4.

02:21:29.320 --> 02:21:34.240
So fuck you guys, cause you just fucked everything up, you took the only station I actually liked

02:21:34.240 --> 02:21:39.520
that felt like a station for me, and you just took a giant crap on it, so you know what?

02:21:39.520 --> 02:21:46.080
Fuck you guys, and when I see you at E3, I'm fucking taking you down, social unrest, that's

02:21:46.080 --> 02:21:49.420
what it will be, so anyway, so fuck them.

02:21:49.420 --> 02:21:54.640
Thank you Loki for destroying any possible opportunity we ever had of taking Orange Lounge

02:21:54.640 --> 02:21:57.560
TV on the air, thank you.

02:21:57.560 --> 02:22:03.680
listen listen I'm not gonna want to be associated with anything on that station

02:22:03.680 --> 02:22:09.320
because that you know it just does not have enough halo in that show so no

02:22:09.320 --> 02:22:15.480
anyway so fuck them and fuck my headache because it sucks but it's starting to go

02:22:15.480 --> 02:22:20.280
away so that's kind of good fuck Grand Theft Auto San Andreas and more

02:22:20.280 --> 02:22:26.400
specifically the woozy mo mission I can't fucking beat it it's annoying why

02:22:26.400 --> 02:22:31.020
Why does anyone, okay, why do street racers, Japanese street racers come to town to have

02:22:31.020 --> 02:22:33.080
an off-road street race?

02:22:33.080 --> 02:22:36.600
I'm sorry, but, you know, people that drive, you know, those racers don't drive off-road,

02:22:36.600 --> 02:22:37.600
okay?

02:22:37.600 --> 02:22:41.720
The racers were not made for off-road, so why do they have a race that goes off-road?

02:22:41.720 --> 02:22:43.280
That sucks.

02:22:43.280 --> 02:22:49.640
And um, finally, fuck you getting the G4 because you suck.

02:22:49.640 --> 02:22:50.760
I hate you.

02:22:50.760 --> 02:22:51.760
I hate you.

02:22:51.760 --> 02:22:52.760
I hate you.

02:22:52.760 --> 02:22:53.760
I hate you.

02:22:53.760 --> 02:23:07.760
I just want to give a special message to Comcast, you know what, despite what Loki says, I will

02:23:07.760 --> 02:23:14.080
still sell out faster than Divine Brown, okay? I just want you to know, and I have this great

02:23:14.080 --> 02:23:19.880
concept, I have this wonderful concept for a gay gaming show, we could call it gamers,

02:23:19.880 --> 02:23:25.960
about it. Think about it. You want me, you know you do. I would take Jamie with me. Loki

02:23:25.960 --> 02:23:29.160
gets left behind, though, after that remark. Does that mean that you have to have the hag

02:23:29.160 --> 02:23:36.160
co-host? Yes, you would be my official fag-hag co-host. Cool. All right. And Loki can polish

02:23:38.360 --> 02:23:42.760
my shoes for all I care. All right. Anyway, on to my FUs, my actual FUs. You could be

02:23:42.760 --> 02:23:48.360
the angry hetero guy in the corner. Yeah. My FUs go to being sick, because I've been

02:23:48.360 --> 02:23:53.580
very sick all weekend and it sucks because remember I was sitting here last week and

02:23:53.580 --> 02:23:57.000
I took a poll how many people were sick and half the people were sick and I said gee the

02:23:57.000 --> 02:24:01.100
rest of us feel like we just got a death sentence like we're waiting to get sick sure enough

02:24:01.100 --> 02:24:05.120
I got sick it wasn't quite as bad like I think the strain kind of got weaker as it went along

02:24:05.120 --> 02:24:10.360
so I can't bitch too much but being sick still sucks I just want to get that out there but

02:24:10.360 --> 02:24:15.680
what I really want to say on FU too is F you to those guys on Halo 2 oh my god I got invited

02:24:15.680 --> 02:24:20.240
into this match on Xbox Live one of my friends somebody on my friends list on

02:24:20.240 --> 02:24:23.040
Xbox you know how like the people on your friends list you sometimes don't

02:24:23.040 --> 02:24:27.040
know him that well well I had one of these guys then he invited me into his

02:24:27.040 --> 02:24:29.760
game and he had like all these experts in there and I guess they were having

02:24:29.760 --> 02:24:33.720
tryouts for their clan and for some reason they wanted me to try out for

02:24:33.720 --> 02:24:38.540
their clan well like we were playing one of those team games it was king of the

02:24:38.540 --> 02:24:42.040
hill and I never played that version before so I didn't know what I was doing

02:24:42.040 --> 02:24:44.040
and my teammates were yelling at me and they were like

02:24:44.040 --> 02:24:45.040
DON'T YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

02:24:45.040 --> 02:24:47.040
COME ON GREEN SKY WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU?

02:24:47.040 --> 02:24:48.040
WHAT IS THIS?

02:24:48.040 --> 02:24:50.040
And I'm just like, I wanted to cry

02:24:50.040 --> 02:24:53.040
I was just like, they're yelling at me and they're being mean to me

02:24:53.040 --> 02:24:55.040
I don't know what I'm doing, fuck your clan

02:24:55.040 --> 02:24:56.040
Rob

02:24:56.040 --> 02:24:59.040
You guys are the Clu Clucks clan right now, that's who you guys are

02:24:59.040 --> 02:25:00.040
Rob

02:25:00.040 --> 02:25:01.040
What?

02:25:01.040 --> 02:25:03.040
You need to join the clan that Dan's in, the fuckers

02:25:03.040 --> 02:25:05.040
Okay, I'll join that

02:25:05.040 --> 02:25:07.040
Are they gonna yell at me if I screw up?

02:25:07.040 --> 02:25:10.040
Probably not, probably half of them will be drunk

02:25:10.040 --> 02:25:18.040
After that match, Flair O'Nai, one of our listeners, invited me into one of his matches, and I blew him up a bunch with a rocket, and that made me feel better.

02:25:18.040 --> 02:25:20.040
So thank you, Flair O'Nai, for letting me take my aggressions out on you.

02:25:20.040 --> 02:25:28.040
That's it. F you to assholes on Halo 2, and F you to people on Xbox Live that when you sign on to the game, they go,

02:25:28.040 --> 02:25:31.040
MEGA MEGA MEGA MEGA MEGA MEGA MEGA MEGA, because they think it makes them look cool.

02:25:31.040 --> 02:25:35.040
FYI, it doesn't. Grow up. Thank you.

02:25:35.040 --> 02:25:41.600
Moving on, let's see what our other guests in the studio have to say, starting with Float

02:25:41.600 --> 02:25:42.600
Walk.

02:25:42.600 --> 02:25:52.440
Oh, sorry, we can't hear you, turn on the mic.

02:25:52.440 --> 02:25:53.440
There you go.

02:25:53.440 --> 02:25:54.440
Damn, I have no idea.

02:25:54.440 --> 02:25:55.440
There you go.

02:25:55.440 --> 02:25:56.440
Sorry about that.

02:25:56.440 --> 02:25:57.440
Okay.

02:25:57.440 --> 02:26:01.600
Well, it's a pretty tame week of FUs for me, although probably the one right now I'm thinking

02:26:01.600 --> 02:26:07.600
more than anything is. F you to, uh, Konami Digital Entertainment America QA department.

02:26:07.600 --> 02:26:14.000
Uh, thanks for laying me off a lot earlier before the game even passed, you know. I mean,

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:17.320
I'll probably get help for even saying it, but there's some things you don't do. You

02:26:17.320 --> 02:26:21.240
don't spit in the wind, you don't tug on Superman's cape, and you don't break up a team before

02:26:21.240 --> 02:26:27.400
the game goes gold. I'll leave it at that, and I think, uh, Mr. Miklotov can totally

02:26:27.400 --> 02:26:32.200
get me off I can't back me up on that one so uh yes I'll leave it very short

02:26:32.200 --> 02:26:38.320
like that before I really go off well I think we'll just move right along to

02:26:38.320 --> 02:26:46.320
explicit one of the biggest F you hate six inches from mouth all right try

02:26:46.320 --> 02:26:53.560
again okay okay yes much better all right I'd like to say a big F you to

02:26:53.560 --> 02:27:00.560
some old guy who rear-ended my fucking car! Oh wow! You rear-ended my car!

02:27:02.800 --> 02:27:08.920
What the hell? Jamie's trying to nap, so you gotta turn it

02:27:08.920 --> 02:27:11.640
down a notch, that's alright. I'm sorry for being so loud, but I was very

02:27:11.640 --> 02:27:17.960
pissed off with the old fart who rear-ended my car and it was this far from moving back.

02:27:17.960 --> 02:27:24.080
I moved out first, so it gets me priority to go first, and the fact that you just went

02:27:24.080 --> 02:27:31.400
like around 20 miles an hour backing up, just cuz you drive an SUV does not mean shit.

02:27:31.400 --> 02:27:37.880
There was no scratches in your car, yet you left a big ass dent in my Toyota Corolla 2004S

02:27:37.880 --> 02:27:43.400
server, now it looks all ugly as hell and I have to pay 200 bucks.

02:27:43.400 --> 02:27:50.200
Now I have to pay 200 bucks off my own money just to get that shit fixed.

02:27:50.200 --> 02:27:54.760
And just because you said, oh, I'm sorry, and run away like it's a hit and run with

02:27:54.760 --> 02:28:01.400
a bunch of cops around doesn't mean I'm going to let you go saying, I forgive you just because

02:28:01.400 --> 02:28:02.400
you built my car.

02:28:02.400 --> 02:28:03.400
Well, guess what?

02:28:03.400 --> 02:28:06.400
I'm on your ass whenever I see you.

02:28:06.400 --> 02:28:13.320
Okay, enough with the FUs with the car because I'll pay that shit up in a few minutes.

02:28:13.320 --> 02:28:15.280
few weeks and stuff

02:28:15.280 --> 02:28:21.560
okay another f he goes to people playing Halo 2 multiplayer

02:28:21.560 --> 02:28:26.560
no certain people, certain people

02:28:26.560 --> 02:28:27.280
alright

02:28:27.280 --> 02:28:31.600
just cause you're touching my balls doesn't mean i'm distracted

02:28:31.600 --> 02:28:35.440
why wait i didn't realize this was a feature in Halo 2

02:28:35.440 --> 02:28:39.400
wait a minute wait a minute

02:28:39.400 --> 02:28:42.280
yeah we see people try to cheat in Halo 2

02:28:42.280 --> 02:28:44.920
So you know what people do in Halo 2?

02:28:44.920 --> 02:28:48.920
Like, if you have four people around, like, what?

02:28:48.920 --> 02:28:52.160
Sorry, I...

02:28:52.160 --> 02:28:55.920
Okay, no. Sorry, sorry, we're doing something else over here. It's a funny, funny picture on a website.

02:28:55.920 --> 02:28:57.120
Ooh, it's interesting.

02:28:57.120 --> 02:29:00.840
So yeah, F you to people who are trying to cheat in Halo 2.

02:29:00.840 --> 02:29:03.200
Yeah, punching people in the face.

02:29:03.200 --> 02:29:08.080
Just try to win a game. It's just a damn game, yo. If you're getting your ass kicked,

02:29:08.080 --> 02:29:09.640
just take the heat.

02:29:09.640 --> 02:29:10.680
There's no need to

02:29:10.680 --> 02:29:14.040
touch people, just touch people, touch people on the balls

02:29:14.040 --> 02:29:16.680
for a sub-sexual desire that you guys have

02:29:16.680 --> 02:29:18.840
and no, I'm not like that, so

02:29:18.840 --> 02:29:21.920
if it was a female, that'd be cool

02:29:21.920 --> 02:29:22.800
okay

02:29:22.800 --> 02:29:24.520
well, speaking of females

02:29:24.520 --> 02:29:32.320
I'd like to say another F you to this one stripper who fucking knee-dropped my...

02:29:32.320 --> 02:29:34.480
yeah, she, yeah

02:29:34.480 --> 02:29:39.180
during Gold Clubs 34, I paid twenty bucks for a few lap dances

02:29:39.180 --> 02:29:41.180
It was this kind of 2 by the way, so I guess...

02:29:45.180 --> 02:29:53.180
It was a cool rap dance and all, but the fact that she acted like a knee drop, like, oops!

02:29:55.180 --> 02:29:57.180
I like tuned out for a second, what the hell?

02:29:57.180 --> 02:30:01.180
This is what you get when we're looking at funny pictures of Sephiroth killing Aerith.

02:30:01.180 --> 02:30:04.180
But they have, they have, we're gonna put it up on the TV so you guys can see it.

02:30:04.180 --> 02:30:22.180
I just posted in the chatroom. Somebody made a signature on the G4 TechTV form. It's Sephiroth, and he has a G4 logo where his face should be, and there's an heiress with a TechTV logo where her face should be, and it's the scene where Sephiroth is about to kill her.

02:30:22.180 --> 02:30:33.180
Yeah, I think the only thing about the stripper needing you in the, like, gonads for the lapdance, I think she noticed that, you know, if you try to get lapdances on a discount, she's gonna be a little miffed too, man.

02:30:33.180 --> 02:30:38.180
Alright. Well, I could've been the mess from the situation.

02:30:38.180 --> 02:30:40.180
Alright, it's a three-hour show. Can I move on now?

02:30:40.180 --> 02:30:42.180
Maybe she was looking, man.

02:30:42.180 --> 02:30:49.180
Well, it's a fact that she has a male name. Her name's Bradley.

02:30:49.180 --> 02:30:51.820
holding anyway can move on to the month

02:30:51.820 --> 02:30:54.380
well who were put out by a real

02:30:54.380 --> 02:30:56.920
chair of that you've got

02:30:56.920 --> 02:31:00.240
presented by you guys which i remember debbie debbie debbie dot uh... orange

02:31:00.240 --> 02:31:02.000
laundry a compliment that

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:03.800
the entire it says

02:31:03.800 --> 02:31:07.600
after you to school not enough time in the day and not having a car license in

02:31:07.600 --> 02:31:11.660
life going a little too fast for me i don't want to grow up

02:31:11.660 --> 02:31:13.580
he has held out the i said

02:31:13.580 --> 02:31:14.880
i heart him

02:31:14.880 --> 02:31:16.340
uh... i thought

02:31:16.340 --> 02:31:18.800
i thought that i was too far

02:31:18.800 --> 02:31:23.580
I know, you're trying to suck up to me because you want to pass it to E3 next year. Don't worry, I got you covered like a Jimmy hat.

02:31:23.580 --> 02:31:26.860
Fucking fanboys.

02:31:26.860 --> 02:31:28.600
Just kidding.

02:31:28.600 --> 02:31:34.600
Actually, if Mel can get me into E3 again, I'll be all up on him, just like the fanboy.

02:31:34.600 --> 02:31:36.820
Not like, up on him.

02:31:36.820 --> 02:31:38.100
But, you know.

02:31:38.100 --> 02:31:38.940
I know.

02:31:38.940 --> 02:31:40.700
Kind of like when you call me a brother.

02:31:40.700 --> 02:31:46.700
You know, not the way, like, we mean in a biological sense, but the way black people talk to each other.

02:31:49.700 --> 02:31:51.700
Anyway, DarklionXVI says,

02:31:51.700 --> 02:31:55.700
F you to annoying tourists who keep on bugging players just for them to look stupid.

02:31:55.700 --> 02:31:59.700
Last night at the Adventure Dome, I had to move a black guy off the Player 2 DR pad

02:31:59.700 --> 02:32:03.700
because he was distracting a friend of mine while playing The Legend of Max this extra stage.

02:32:03.700 --> 02:32:07.700
F you to myself for going to a debut party last week, ending up doing nothing at all.

02:32:07.700 --> 02:32:14.700
Legend of Zaku says, F you to my little brother for running up almost $30 in overages at the

02:32:14.700 --> 02:32:18.380
wireless bill this month. F you to Leisure Time bowling alley and Port Authority bus

02:32:18.380 --> 02:32:22.620
terminal in New York City for being assholes by trashing there in the groove for a second

02:32:22.620 --> 02:32:23.620
extreme machine.

02:32:23.620 --> 02:32:27.700
Yay, score one for the good guys.

02:32:27.700 --> 02:32:35.740
Dark Tetsuya says, F you to, surprise surprise, Comcast for taking a giant crap on G4TechTV.

02:32:35.740 --> 02:32:41.680
DD Archaholic says, F you to people who think that there are hot guys in video games.

02:32:41.680 --> 02:32:44.800
I may not play a lot of video games myself, but I'm pretty sure there are no hot guys

02:32:44.800 --> 02:32:45.800
in them.

02:32:45.800 --> 02:32:48.280
Big ol' sweaty rowdy rowdy Piper is not a hot guy.

02:32:48.280 --> 02:32:53.680
He does not make me moist with his chest pounding, nor does his ugly Cro-Magnon man head or his

02:32:53.680 --> 02:32:57.840
butt crack, which is pinched shut due to the vice grip power of his gluteus maxi, make

02:32:57.840 --> 02:32:59.480
my nipples hard.

02:32:59.480 --> 02:33:01.540
Antonio Banderas is a hot hot guy.

02:33:01.540 --> 02:33:04.500
He is not in video games, no monsieur.

02:33:04.500 --> 02:33:08.260
And F you if you think that complaining about the lack of hot guys in the media is a sad

02:33:08.260 --> 02:33:16.540
pursuit because your continuous excitement of bouncing boobies is itself a sad pursuit.

02:33:16.540 --> 02:33:17.540
So there.

02:33:17.540 --> 02:33:18.540
Suck my titty.

02:33:18.540 --> 02:33:19.540
Hallo.

02:33:19.540 --> 02:33:20.540
Wow.

02:33:20.540 --> 02:33:27.740
Iguana Girl says, a lovely F you to idiots who think they can talk their way out of warning

02:33:27.740 --> 02:33:30.620
points for flame bait.

02:33:30.620 --> 02:33:35.360
They're coming to get you.

02:33:35.360 --> 02:33:37.880
Failed.

02:33:37.880 --> 02:33:42.200
Dark Knight has one FU tonight and that's to torment I'm going to be facing at work

02:33:42.200 --> 02:33:43.880
here from on out.

02:33:43.880 --> 02:33:47.880
Note, I work at for a retail store, need I say more?

02:33:47.880 --> 02:33:53.440
So, he works at a retail store therefore this is not going to be a happy fun time of year

02:33:53.440 --> 02:33:54.440
for him.

02:33:54.440 --> 02:34:00.120
Q says F you to Halo 2 for making it almost impossible to get an Xbox and

02:34:00.120 --> 02:34:05.360
Misty says fuck me for sleeping until 6 central and having to get to work at 5

02:34:05.360 --> 02:34:10.640
I doubt I'll be getting any sleep tonight that's it for our chat room F

02:34:10.640 --> 02:34:19.240
use whoo all right very colorful F use from all you guys thank you all right

02:34:19.240 --> 02:34:23.760
all right we're gonna do now is we're gonna go to break in this break we're

02:34:23.760 --> 02:34:28.480
going to hear another brand new long version of an UltraMix 2 song. I think this time we're

02:34:28.480 --> 02:34:32.340
going to do a group that's already been announced actually. You already kind of knew they were

02:34:32.340 --> 02:34:37.460
in UltraMix 2 with a song called C Squared because it was on the V-rare. They have another

02:34:37.460 --> 02:34:42.300
song in DDR UltraMix as well that was announced on the website and it's called Mellow and

02:34:42.300 --> 02:34:49.140
the group is Alien number 613. For whatever it's worth, whatever. Oh man, all I can say

02:34:49.140 --> 02:34:52.140
And yeah, again, Miklotov can get me back on this one.

02:34:52.140 --> 02:34:54.140
What a pain this was to work on.

02:34:54.140 --> 02:34:56.140
Oh shit, I missed an FU. Oh man.

02:34:56.140 --> 02:34:59.140
And I see here Miklotov, it's his FU, he's pissed at me.

02:34:59.140 --> 02:35:00.140
See, ain't I handy.

02:35:00.140 --> 02:35:02.140
Hold on, hold on.

02:35:02.140 --> 02:35:04.140
Let me get the FU music again.

02:35:04.140 --> 02:35:06.140
You feel all special.

02:35:08.140 --> 02:35:12.140
Miklotov says FU to Halo 2 for not saving my damn progress.

02:35:12.140 --> 02:35:14.140
Now I have to play this fucking level again.

02:35:14.140 --> 02:35:15.140
Who on you Halo 2?

02:35:15.140 --> 02:35:20.180
too. F you to people who don't realize Drawn Together is one of the hottest shows ever.

02:35:20.180 --> 02:35:24.140
It sounds like a horrible idea for a show, and it is, but it's the best thing on Comedy

02:35:24.140 --> 02:35:31.140
Central since Strangers with Candy. I love you, Xander.

02:35:31.140 --> 02:35:47.420
Alright, sorry Mikotov, I just, your window for some reason didn't show up as red, because

02:35:47.420 --> 02:35:49.980
you were sending the other messages earlier, that's why.

02:35:49.980 --> 02:35:55.180
Anyway, let's get to the break, alright, as I promised, alien number 613 in the song is

02:35:55.180 --> 02:36:02.180
called Mellow. Enjoy.

02:36:25.180 --> 02:36:27.180
Oh

02:37:55.180 --> 02:37:57.180
Oh

02:39:25.180 --> 02:39:36.540
Hello? Hello, is this thing on testing? Testing one, two?

02:39:36.540 --> 02:39:40.580
I'm looking in the index, but I don't see anything for how to run a radio show.

02:39:40.580 --> 02:39:44.620
Hello? I don't understand this. Does this thing work?

02:39:44.620 --> 02:39:46.980
This thing reads like stereo instructions. Is this on?

02:39:46.980 --> 02:39:53.300
What the hell? Orange Lounge Radio. Broke down ghetto bimani

02:39:53.300 --> 02:40:00.180
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio. We're going to do some Ask Orange Lounge. We're

02:40:00.180 --> 02:40:03.820
going to wind down this episode with some Ask Orange Lounge. So please, send in your

02:40:03.820 --> 02:40:08.900
questions over private message to Sky and let me put that in the chat room too so that

02:40:08.900 --> 02:40:16.100
they can do that. There you go. And also, we'll open up the Skype line for you guys

02:40:16.100 --> 02:40:19.380

02:40:19.380 --> 02:40:22.780
gotten to talk to all you guys yet tonight. Again, if you want more information on the

02:40:22.780 --> 02:40:27.960
the skifline, visit www.orangelaungeradio.com and click on interact with us. Yes, Loki?

02:40:27.960 --> 02:40:34.260
I would like to take this moment to talk about the wonderful show called Drawn Together.

02:40:34.260 --> 02:40:39.460
I watched today the first two episodes twice, and I have to say it's the fucking, it is

02:40:39.460 --> 02:40:45.520
on par, if not better, than the Family Guy, and that was way up there. Okay, hold on,

02:40:45.520 --> 02:40:50.880
We're getting a call. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:40:50.880 --> 02:40:52.760
Hi. Hello.

02:40:52.760 --> 02:40:57.760
Turn down the speaker volume in your house.

02:40:57.760 --> 02:41:01.700
Hi, we can barely hear you, but we can hear ourselves echoing. Turn down your

02:41:01.700 --> 02:41:03.160
in-studio volume there.

02:41:03.160 --> 02:41:04.900
The first rule of radio.

02:41:04.900 --> 02:41:08.480
Turn down your WIN app or whatever. Turn down your external volume.

02:41:08.480 --> 02:41:09.680
Hello.

02:41:09.680 --> 02:41:11.080
Hi, who's this?

02:41:11.080 --> 02:41:14.100
This is MPQ. Hi, MPQ. What's on your mind?

02:41:14.100 --> 02:41:21.100
I was wondering if you could get, uh, Pop Music 5 into rotation, because, um, well I like the music in Pop Music 5.

02:41:21.100 --> 02:41:26.100
Um, Pop Music 5 music, certainly, I thought we already had a couple songs in there in rotation. What, any songs in-

02:41:26.100 --> 02:41:27.100
I didn't hear any.

02:41:27.100 --> 02:41:29.100
Any songs in particular you're looking for?

02:41:29.100 --> 02:41:39.100
I'm not sure the exact, exact titles, I think Tempura Brothers, uh, Susiliana, they're Japanese titles that, that, it's in there somewhere.

02:41:39.100 --> 02:41:48.100
You know what I'll do? I will have our resident Poppin' Music whore, Navi, take a look at the soundtrack and tell me what I need to add, and we'll put some tracks and rotation just for you, my friend.

02:41:48.100 --> 02:41:50.100
Thanks. That's cool.

02:41:50.100 --> 02:41:52.100
No problem. Anything else you want to comment on?

02:41:52.100 --> 02:41:54.100
Not really.

02:41:54.100 --> 02:41:56.100
Are you liking the Bimani Music and More program otherwise?

02:41:56.100 --> 02:41:58.100
Yeah, I like Bimani Music.

02:41:58.100 --> 02:42:00.100
Good. Good to hear. All right, well, bud, thanks for calling.

02:42:00.100 --> 02:42:01.100
All right.

02:42:01.100 --> 02:42:02.100
Have a good one.

02:42:02.100 --> 02:42:03.100
Have a good one.

02:42:03.100 --> 02:42:04.100
Shit.

02:42:04.100 --> 02:42:09.500
Well that's one way to get your way, to call one of the hosts mid-show and demand it.

02:42:09.500 --> 02:42:13.380
No, but popping music is a little bit under-represented, I'll give it that.

02:42:13.380 --> 02:42:14.600
We don't have enough tracks.

02:42:14.600 --> 02:42:18.060
So I will go talk to the resident popping music horror and see what needs to be added

02:42:18.060 --> 02:42:19.060
from the old ones.

02:42:19.060 --> 02:42:23.500
Shit, if you want to talk about a game that hasn't changed since day one, popping music?

02:42:23.500 --> 02:42:25.060
Holy crap!

02:42:25.060 --> 02:42:26.660
Why is that game so popular?

02:42:26.660 --> 02:42:27.660
That's what I want to know.

02:42:27.660 --> 02:42:28.660
Ah, buttons!

02:42:28.660 --> 02:42:29.660
I hit the buttons!

02:42:29.660 --> 02:42:30.660
Fun!

02:42:30.660 --> 02:42:31.660
Japanese?

02:42:31.660 --> 02:42:33.860
JAPANESE MUSIC, COOL!

02:42:33.860 --> 02:42:34.780
I mean, it's just...

02:42:34.780 --> 02:42:37.780
No, that game does not appeal to me at all. It's like...

02:42:37.780 --> 02:42:40.700
It's like 2DX for retards, I mean...

02:42:40.700 --> 02:42:44.540
It's just the big buttons. But, you know, hey, I guess there's a demographic out there for, you know,

02:42:44.540 --> 02:42:46.540
retarded 2DX players, so...

02:42:46.540 --> 02:42:50.500
Hey, if you want to play... It's like playing 2DX with boxing gloves, you know? If you want to do that,

02:42:50.500 --> 02:42:55.820
so be it. I mean, it's cool. It's cool because it gets crazy and stuff, but, you know,

02:42:55.820 --> 02:42:59.800
they just really haven't changed anything with that game. They have not changed much.

02:42:59.800 --> 02:43:12.800
But here I am, the uninformed pop music person, because I don't play pop music, and I tried playing pop music, and it just did not appeal to me, but for some reason I'm still putting pop music in my cabinet, so I'll give it another go later.

02:43:12.800 --> 02:43:14.800
Yeah, you take the good, you take the bad.

02:43:14.800 --> 02:43:16.800
Yeah, whatever. Anyway.

02:43:16.800 --> 02:43:20.800
You take them both, and there you have the facts of the life, the facts of the life.

02:43:20.800 --> 02:43:24.880
Whatever happened to that Simphile contest we were gonna do like a while back on the show?

02:43:25.400 --> 02:43:32.820
Remember we were gonna have the Orange Lounge Radio response to Simphile contest and we were gonna have the all TV show Simphile theme

02:43:37.160 --> 02:43:38.440
Yeah, I know

02:43:38.440 --> 02:43:40.040
They can do tournaments shit

02:43:40.040 --> 02:43:44.620
I mean we could give away we could give away sign to Kiryamoka CDs for God's sakes people would enter for that

02:43:45.360 --> 02:43:48.520
DVDs in my room. I know seriously we didn't have more contests

02:43:48.520 --> 02:43:55.520
I still have like 30 Max2 viewers at my place if anyone wants them.

02:43:55.520 --> 02:43:58.520
Let's just start giving away like candy, hey.

02:43:58.520 --> 02:44:02.520
Dude, that's like all we do at like DDR sponsored tournaments.

02:44:02.520 --> 02:44:08.520
There you go. Alright.

02:44:08.520 --> 02:44:17.520
Alright, let's get into a favorite segment here on this program which we haven't done in quite some time.

02:44:17.520 --> 02:44:21.840
sticking with us for a walk? Yeah, what the hell, I'll stay here till the end. All right,

02:44:21.840 --> 02:44:26.760
that's a real trooper there. Yeah, you know, hell, sleep's overrated I guess. Yeah, that's

02:44:26.760 --> 02:44:38.120
right. All right, here we go. That's only 15 more minutes. Let's ask Orange Lounge some

02:44:38.120 --> 02:44:43.900
stupid question. What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio? Since it's been

02:44:43.900 --> 02:44:49.700
few weeks since we've had a segment I expect there to be lots of questions or

02:44:49.700 --> 02:45:01.260
else all right here's a real winner this questions from legend of Zaku I love

02:45:01.260 --> 02:45:04.980
this question this is what this is why I missed the ask orange lounge segment

02:45:04.980 --> 02:45:08.820
because remember you can ask us about the money you can ask us about whatever

02:45:08.820 --> 02:45:13.540
the hell you want and this definitely falls into the latter legend of Zaku

02:45:13.540 --> 02:45:20.260
says being a person of Hispanic descent how come white girls like and have a

02:45:20.260 --> 02:45:26.900
thing for Hispanic guys dude ask Eddie Guerrero from the WWE it's all about

02:45:26.900 --> 02:45:32.800
Latino he just burst into the room one for whatever from where this is all of

02:45:32.800 --> 02:45:46.560
us do hey man you want to see my Aztec warrior got a love next Friday hi papi

02:45:49.560 --> 02:45:53.560
that has to be one of those retarded questions I've ever heard in my life

02:45:53.560 --> 02:46:00.880
so generalized I personally maybe in his neck of the woods but in general I'm

02:46:00.880 --> 02:46:07.120
I'm sorry, no offense. I've dated a few Hispanic guys, but most in general, I've not had very

02:46:07.120 --> 02:46:16.440
good experiences with. I have a lot of friends. I've dated a few guys, but in general, I haven't

02:46:16.440 --> 02:46:21.240
had a very good experience in a romantic relationship with Hispanic men.

02:46:21.240 --> 02:46:25.680
I dated a Hispanic guy once. It was a nice date. Son of a bitch never called me back,

02:46:25.680 --> 02:46:28.240
but it was a nice date.

02:46:28.240 --> 02:46:31.500
i think probably the fact that i have a hispanic last name you know

02:46:31.500 --> 02:46:33.540
i could be a hard drive

02:46:33.540 --> 02:46:37.140
by two wonder why all the white chicks dig me too

02:46:37.140 --> 02:46:38.300
uh...

02:46:38.300 --> 02:46:43.080
i can't i can't answer this question without going like a racist

02:46:43.080 --> 02:46:47.680
uh... let's move on to the second question that

02:46:47.680 --> 02:46:50.080
uh... let's see jazz

02:46:50.080 --> 02:46:53.500
well this is a good question have any of you guys play technic beat

02:46:53.500 --> 02:46:56.500
and if so what do you think of it this is a brand new game that came out from i

02:46:56.500 --> 02:46:57.820
believe namco

02:46:57.820 --> 02:47:00.460
did it and it's another one of their bargain basement games like i'd like to

02:47:00.460 --> 02:47:04.040
buy she had heard a lot of great things about it but i think i had a more to pay

02:47:04.040 --> 02:47:06.580
i've seen pictures

02:47:06.580 --> 02:47:09.900
well i haven't read it i've seen pictures of what's interesting but i

02:47:09.900 --> 02:47:13.580
haven't waited i've heard very very good things about it and i like well of

02:47:13.580 --> 02:47:18.180
reports of something i like it's on my to-do list because it it is you know we

02:47:18.180 --> 02:47:21.540
want to cut all the time i think you were you the alien that noise people

02:47:21.540 --> 02:47:23.160
sound of the uh...

02:47:23.160 --> 02:47:25.560
uh... below the uh... under the skin

02:47:25.560 --> 02:47:26.560
under the skin.

02:47:26.560 --> 02:47:27.560
But that has nothing to do with Technic Beat.

02:47:27.560 --> 02:47:28.560
I know.

02:47:28.560 --> 02:47:29.560
Quick change to the subject.

02:47:29.560 --> 02:47:30.560
Alright.

02:47:30.560 --> 02:47:33.280
But yeah, Technic Beat, I'm looking forward to it.

02:47:33.280 --> 02:47:35.800
I've heard a lot of great things about it, unfortunately, I have not had a chance to

02:47:35.800 --> 02:47:36.800
play it yet.

02:47:36.800 --> 02:47:39.720
I haven't seen it anywhere, strangely enough.

02:47:39.720 --> 02:47:41.560
I didn't even realize it was out until I went onto a website.

02:47:41.560 --> 02:47:44.560
I was looking for under the skin the last time I was at the mall.

02:47:44.560 --> 02:47:45.560
Nothing.

02:47:45.560 --> 02:47:46.560
Alright.

02:47:46.560 --> 02:47:50.560
Technic Beat, we will check it out as soon as we can.

02:47:50.560 --> 02:47:53.080
Don't we still need to get Karaoke Revolution 3?

02:47:53.080 --> 02:47:54.080
Yes we do.

02:47:54.080 --> 02:47:55.080
Thank you for reminding me.

02:47:55.080 --> 02:48:00.120
I'm hoping I want to I want to invite a guana girl back on the show so we can do our duet to love shack

02:48:00.120 --> 02:48:03.920
Live on air on revolution 3. I hope she'll be down for it. So

02:48:04.720 --> 02:48:06.720
And then we're gonna make you angry

02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:09.000
So very ronery

02:48:10.800 --> 02:48:12.800
All right

02:48:13.920 --> 02:48:18.920
Dd. Archaholic says when you guys are not playing the money games. What other toys do you like?

02:48:18.920 --> 02:48:26.920
Mike, mine come from a store called Goldies which is located on 16th, nevermind, I'm kidding.

02:48:26.920 --> 02:48:32.920
I don't know, I don't have any toys in the living room that might be displaying video or anything like that.

02:48:32.920 --> 02:48:34.920
I have my computer.

02:48:34.920 --> 02:48:42.920
I have my computer, my turntables, my cabinet, my game systems, my portal to hell device.

02:48:42.920 --> 02:48:47.920
I don't need toys, I have a man I can climb all over.

02:48:47.920 --> 02:48:54.920
kostjamrh And that has been a journey into the TMI Zone.

02:49:17.920 --> 02:49:23.920
And of course Yu-Gi-Oh cards, which I toss around nowadays, and that's really about it.

02:49:23.920 --> 02:49:25.920
I'm kind of out going to toy things.

02:49:25.920 --> 02:49:27.920
Except I still play with bobbleheads.

02:49:27.920 --> 02:49:30.920
Do you miss Kyle Snyder as a worthy opponent at Yu-Gi-Oh?

02:49:30.920 --> 02:49:36.920
Oh my God, totally. Where else would you get a totally great duel, along with color commentary on the side?

02:49:36.920 --> 02:49:45.920
I mean, it's straight up walking into the cartoon, and if you are not playing Yu-Gi-Oh, you are in the mini production of a movie.

02:49:45.920 --> 02:50:10.680
p0k3smot42o

02:50:10.680 --> 02:50:15.560
right now. He didn't die or anything. He's just on a mission right now.

02:50:15.560 --> 02:50:23.280
I don't have anything. I already talked about my toys.

02:50:23.280 --> 02:50:27.800
We have another question for Ask Orange Lounge from Chance. And Chance is asking, when are

02:50:27.800 --> 02:50:32.760
you going to update the chat server info on the website? Zing! I didn't know it was wrong.

02:50:32.760 --> 02:50:36.300
I actually did not know it was wrong. I will look into that. Thank you for bringing that

02:50:36.300 --> 02:50:41.240
to my attention. Yikes! I thought it worked just fine. I'm still the one using the Java

02:50:41.240 --> 02:50:45.820
chat. Maybe you know what it is? I think it's because one of the other side IRC things went

02:50:45.820 --> 02:50:57.820
down. I will look into that. My bad. And Jazz, okay, his second question to us is, why are

02:50:57.820 --> 02:51:10.860
boobs? That's the question. Why are boobs spelled B-E-W-B-S. Boobs. B-E-U-B-S. B-E-U-B-S.

02:51:10.860 --> 02:51:27.480
Why are boobs? Why not? Lovely. Cause if milk came out their ass that'd be weird. They're

02:51:27.480 --> 02:51:30.860
make the world go round. I mean think about it, when you were a kid and you were crying,

02:51:30.860 --> 02:51:35.260
what did mom do? She shoved one of them in your mouth. Women out there, just understand,

02:51:35.260 --> 02:51:40.660
if you ever want to make us shove one in our mouth, man.

02:51:40.660 --> 02:51:41.660
Wow, okay.

02:51:41.660 --> 02:51:42.660
Women.

02:51:42.660 --> 02:51:45.660
What, what, what Jamie?

02:51:45.660 --> 02:51:46.660
Tasty.

02:51:46.660 --> 02:51:55.260
I'm changing the subject.

02:51:55.260 --> 02:51:56.260
This is the next...

02:51:56.260 --> 02:51:57.260
No you.

02:51:57.260 --> 02:52:00.020
I don't want to go with this question because I don't know if I want to bring up politics

02:52:00.020 --> 02:52:01.020
on this program.

02:52:01.020 --> 02:52:04.300
If you want to argue politics, go to random chat on DDRFreak.

02:52:04.300 --> 02:52:07.300
There's tons of politics threads there.

02:52:07.300 --> 02:52:09.380
Who did you vote for on election day?

02:52:09.380 --> 02:52:10.380
Ask the question to Zaku.

02:52:10.380 --> 02:52:11.380
I think the answer was a few weeks ago.

02:52:11.380 --> 02:52:12.380
I know.

02:52:12.380 --> 02:52:14.320
Honestly, if you listen to the show enough, you know.

02:52:14.320 --> 02:52:16.240
You know that Jamie voted for Bill the Cat.

02:52:16.240 --> 02:52:17.700
You know that I voted for Terry.

02:52:17.700 --> 02:52:18.700
You know that...

02:52:18.700 --> 02:52:22.140
All the candidates were pieces of flaming shit, so...

02:52:22.140 --> 02:52:23.140
And not flaming in the goo-way.

02:52:23.140 --> 02:52:26.620
I mean flaming as in, on fire so they're extra stinky.

02:52:26.620 --> 02:52:30.900
So, you know, if I voted, it'd probably have been like I would have voted for Kerry, but

02:52:30.900 --> 02:52:36.060
the election machine would have seen that I was actually intoxicated or out of my mind

02:52:36.060 --> 02:52:38.100
it would have voted Bush for me, so.

02:52:38.100 --> 02:52:40.620
Now, let me take a poll here.

02:52:40.620 --> 02:52:42.340
Who did vote on election day?

02:52:42.340 --> 02:52:43.700
No matter who you voted for, you did vote.

02:52:43.700 --> 02:52:44.700
I didn't.

02:52:44.700 --> 02:52:46.960
It looks like me and Triple Explicit did.

02:52:46.960 --> 02:52:50.260
Everybody here but Loki went and voted on election day, so that's something.

02:52:50.260 --> 02:52:54.780
I mean, usually on a typical election year, there wouldn't be this many people voting,

02:52:54.780 --> 02:53:00.060
So I think that says enough right there, at least everybody voted, well, a lot more people

02:53:00.060 --> 02:53:01.580
than usual voted, which is good.

02:53:01.580 --> 02:53:06.500
My take on voting has always been, if you're gonna complain about stuff, at least be proactive

02:53:06.500 --> 02:53:07.500
one way or another.

02:53:07.500 --> 02:53:11.060
It doesn't matter how you vote, as long as you do it, hey, you have a say.

02:53:11.060 --> 02:53:14.660
That's why sometimes people say, oh yeah man, I hate what's going on, all this kind of stuff,

02:53:14.660 --> 02:53:15.660
but I'm not gonna vote.

02:53:15.660 --> 02:53:18.780
But how the fuck are you gonna change things?

02:53:18.780 --> 02:53:21.820
I don't care how you vote, not everyone's gonna see eye to eye.

02:53:21.820 --> 02:53:25.800
If you think the government should always be one certain party or the other, you're

02:53:25.800 --> 02:53:27.280
no different than Osama.

02:53:27.280 --> 02:53:32.200
If you think the government should be run one way only, then that's not a cool thing.

02:53:32.200 --> 02:53:36.680
I think you've got to mix it up once in a while, and that's why we have different parties.

02:53:36.680 --> 02:53:39.560
I know Jamie goes off about there's more than two parties.

02:53:39.560 --> 02:53:45.080
I think what people aren't getting is you can't make change from the top down.

02:53:45.080 --> 02:53:47.120
You've got to start from the bottom up.

02:53:47.120 --> 02:53:51.480
If an independent party can't win a senator job sometimes, how the hell is it going to

02:53:51.480 --> 02:53:56.700
be president. You know, it's just, I don't say it can't happen or shouldn't happen, but

02:53:56.700 --> 02:54:00.620
I think they've just got to aim a little smaller first before they, you know, go for the big

02:54:00.620 --> 02:54:01.620
prize.

02:54:01.620 --> 02:54:08.140
I still am for disabling the electoral college, and getting rid of the party system altogether.

02:54:08.140 --> 02:54:13.140
I am all for, and you might hear me complain about this later, I am all for disabling electronic

02:54:13.140 --> 02:54:20.420
voting. Paperless voting is very bad, I think, yes, I totally agree with that.

02:54:20.420 --> 02:54:24.420
Wait, it's Ask Orange Lounge. We got on electronic voting.

02:54:24.420 --> 02:54:30.420
Electronic voting offers more of a chance that the vote is either not going to be counted, altered.

02:54:30.420 --> 02:54:36.420
It has a lot more inconsistency. That's why voting, I did a write-in absentee.

02:54:36.420 --> 02:54:44.420
Even though at the polls they had the floating hanging chad problem this year, just like they did back last election.

02:54:44.420 --> 02:54:44.920
Why?

02:54:44.920 --> 02:54:49.420
Well I think the way they need to do it is, honestly I love the way they do it in Sacramento County.

02:54:49.420 --> 02:54:53.420
You have a mix of electronic and paper. You fill in the bubble and then you scan it.

02:54:53.420 --> 02:54:57.920
And that way you scan it and if there's a dispute with the way they're scanned you have a paper trail.

02:54:57.920 --> 02:54:59.920
I think it's a perfect way to do it, personally.

02:54:59.920 --> 02:55:02.920
Oh, okay. I thought you meant like... Okay, never mind.

02:55:02.920 --> 02:55:03.920
Scantron!

02:55:03.920 --> 02:55:07.920
Yeah, I'm totally fine with Scantron voting. I just do not like electronic voting with no paper trail.

02:55:07.920 --> 02:55:12.920
And for all those kids out there, you know it's really fun to do a Scantron test.

02:55:12.920 --> 02:55:18.520
there's this little bubble in the top of the test marquee. And if you scan that in, guess

02:55:18.520 --> 02:55:26.520
what? You're the answers. It really fucks up all the tests. Anyway, off the politics

02:55:26.520 --> 02:55:33.560
subject, but I want to wrap up the last few questions here so we can close this segment.

02:55:33.560 --> 02:55:37.480
Dark Knight has a weird one here. This might be a sad question, but this is all I have.

02:55:37.480 --> 02:55:42.740
which trading card game slash cartoon crossover is the worst

02:55:42.740 --> 02:55:45.360
that if you've seen any of them if you don't answer don't

02:55:45.360 --> 02:55:47.180
all of them

02:55:47.180 --> 02:55:48.440
all of them

02:55:48.440 --> 02:55:52.260
not all of all of them so slowly all of them

02:55:52.260 --> 02:55:54.580
i don't know kind of hard to say i mean

02:55:54.580 --> 02:55:56.060
everyone i mean

02:55:56.060 --> 02:55:58.780
by person not even a big a fan of pokemon really but

02:55:58.780 --> 02:56:02.020
i think it's funny because not me it's kind of cool but i mean if i had to pick

02:56:02.020 --> 02:56:02.780
one but

02:56:02.780 --> 02:56:06.220
funny thing cuz i think of my cartoons and crossovers into t c g's

02:56:06.220 --> 02:56:11.380
I heard a rumor from, like, Upper Deck, who does, like, the Marvel vs. series, like, soon

02:56:11.380 --> 02:56:15.060
they're supposed to be releasing one with, like, the Justice League, so you could have,

02:56:15.060 --> 02:56:18.700
like, Superman, Batman, the Wonder Twins, and all that stuff, versus, like, Brainiac,

02:56:18.700 --> 02:56:19.700
Mitzel Plink, and all that.

02:56:19.700 --> 02:56:22.700
I mean, would that not be just the coolest idea ever?

02:56:22.700 --> 02:56:24.580
That would be a cool video game.

02:56:24.580 --> 02:56:25.580
Card game, no.

02:56:25.580 --> 02:56:26.580
Eh.

02:56:26.580 --> 02:56:27.580
Is Aquaman in there?

02:56:27.580 --> 02:56:28.580
Of course, man.

02:56:28.580 --> 02:56:31.100
An Aquaman ain't gonna drown in no tub.

02:56:31.100 --> 02:56:35.740
Alright, alright, one more, Duel Masters is pretty ass.

02:56:35.740 --> 02:56:42.220
more question here then we got to wrap it up last question from oh last

02:56:42.220 --> 02:56:46.580
question from dark Tetsuya he sent me a song to put in cage match this week and

02:56:46.580 --> 02:56:50.060
he says you didn't use my song did this because I put it in the wrong format no

02:56:50.060 --> 02:56:52.980
it's just because I really want to put that other song you know your song is in

02:56:52.980 --> 02:56:57.660
my queue it'll come up eventually don't worry so no worries if you have

02:56:57.660 --> 02:57:00.700
suggestions you can always send us an email one of the hosts an email and we'll

02:57:00.700 --> 02:57:04.060
get your song in cage match if we like it and I do like his pick so I'll get in

02:57:04.060 --> 02:57:07.060
Nobody except Spammer sends me an email.

02:57:34.060 --> 02:57:37.060
Roadwalk, your final thought. Thanks for being here again, by the way, bud.

02:57:37.060 --> 02:57:45.060
Uh, not a problem. Um, I just want to say, go out there, support Ultramix, too, and, uh, support, uh, Orange Lounge,

02:57:45.060 --> 02:57:51.060
support, uh, all of Bemani, because, hey, man, you guys are like a Wonderbra, you are the wind beneath our wings,

02:57:51.060 --> 02:57:55.060
you are all that, and, uh, bucket of wings, and, et cetera, et cetera, and I shall cut myself off.

02:57:55.060 --> 02:57:59.060
Coca-Cola, Wonderbra.

02:57:59.060 --> 02:58:02.060
Uh, explicit, your final thought.

02:58:02.060 --> 02:58:05.560
Not to purchase WWX, rumble roses. Heh heh.

02:58:05.560 --> 02:58:06.560
Yeah, yeah!

02:58:06.560 --> 02:58:10.200
Uh, Low G. Low G, your final thoughts?

02:58:10.200 --> 02:58:14.620
My headache's gone, that makes me happy.

02:58:14.620 --> 02:58:20.060
Uh, my final thought is, um...

02:58:20.060 --> 02:58:21.960
Hi. That's it, I have nothing else to say.

02:58:21.960 --> 02:58:24.100
Uh, Jamie, your final thoughts?

02:58:24.100 --> 02:58:28.280
I have to drive home in a freakin' Benadryl coma.

02:58:28.280 --> 02:58:29.840
Damn nation.

02:58:29.840 --> 02:58:34.720
I have to drive through the boring part of Vadie to get home.

02:58:34.720 --> 02:58:41.000
And Mel has love for DDR Freak, I hear ya Jess, don't worry, it wasn't intentional.

02:58:41.000 --> 02:58:43.640
And I have to drive with a broken car.

02:58:43.640 --> 02:58:48.440
Yeah, so we've given DDR Freak tons of plugs tonight, you know, well, of course, the whole indication thing helps, but...

02:58:48.440 --> 02:58:50.640
Yeah, it's cool.

02:58:50.640 --> 02:58:54.880
I mean, it's, you know, pretty dope. We're starting to come together as one big Bamani bunch.

02:58:54.880 --> 02:58:57.520
It's fucking Katamari, that's what it is.

02:58:57.520 --> 02:59:01.800
Yeah, you know what, this DDR thing is going to die soon anyway, so we better all be prepared

02:59:01.800 --> 02:59:04.720
to be Katamari Damacy Radio and Katamari Damacy Freak and Katamari Spot.

02:59:04.720 --> 02:59:07.120
No, we're all getting like Katamari together, man.

02:59:07.120 --> 02:59:10.920
You see, we built it up big enough to take DDR Freak, which is like the biggest of all

02:59:10.920 --> 02:59:11.920
of us.

02:59:11.920 --> 02:59:14.960
See, you started with Orange Lounge, then you rolled up DDR, and now you're going to

02:59:14.960 --> 02:59:15.960
roll them up.

02:59:15.960 --> 02:59:16.960
Yeah, seriously, seriously.

02:59:16.960 --> 02:59:22.360
Orange Lounge has to roll up like all the other little Bomani sites before it can really

02:59:22.360 --> 02:59:23.840
take on Freak, okay?

02:59:23.840 --> 02:59:24.840
No, I'm kidding.

02:59:24.840 --> 02:59:33.840
To answer in the chat room, as I am feeling very, very ill right now, I may or may not be online when I get home, I'm probably going to go right to bed, but we'll see.

02:59:33.840 --> 02:59:41.840
It's all about Orange Lounge Town, in the brand new, coming to the DS.

02:59:41.840 --> 02:59:43.840
Home!

02:59:43.840 --> 02:59:44.840
Animal Crossing.

02:59:44.840 --> 02:59:45.840
Bingo!

02:59:45.840 --> 02:59:49.840
That's right, our free DS is going to be at my house soon.

02:59:49.840 --> 02:59:54.840
I want a free DS. What the hell? What is with you people and your hookups?

02:59:54.840 --> 02:59:55.840
To manage a GameStop.

02:59:55.840 --> 02:59:56.840
You're free DS.

02:59:56.840 --> 02:59:57.840
That's okay.

02:59:57.840 --> 02:59:58.840
You're free Konami.

02:59:58.840 --> 03:00:04.840
I'll feel good to have known that I earned my DS out of two days of hard work.

03:00:04.840 --> 03:00:07.840
Way to put down everybody on Lanky Style. All right.

03:00:07.840 --> 03:00:11.840
I think Dan earned his by having managed a GameStop for us on the show.

03:00:11.840 --> 03:00:17.840
All right. All right. Final word of the show. Lanky Style, I'm going to give you tonight's final word, Mr. Lanky Style.

03:00:17.840 --> 03:00:24.580
Mr. Lanky's got one word to sum it all up, one word to sum it all up, M-G-S-3-B-A-C-H!

03:00:24.580 --> 03:00:30.300
That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

03:00:30.300 --> 03:00:34.220

And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.

03:00:46.820 --> 03:00:53.260
Well, it's the holiday season and Santa is checking his list to see who is naughty or

03:00:53.260 --> 03:00:58.820
nice and I'm kind of feeling guilty, so I wrote a song.

03:00:58.820 --> 03:01:15.820
So many presents. So little time. Santa won't be coming by my house this year.

03:01:15.820 --> 03:01:22.820
Of course I tried to drown my sister and I pierced my ear.

03:01:22.820 --> 03:01:26.820
Oh, mama made it perfectly clear

03:01:26.820 --> 03:01:32.820
Santa don't like bad boys

03:01:32.820 --> 03:01:35.820
Especially Jewish ones

03:01:35.820 --> 03:01:39.820
Genifconop and Lego blocks

03:01:39.820 --> 03:01:41.820
Are what I desire

03:01:41.820 --> 03:01:43.820
So why'd I have to set

03:01:43.820 --> 03:01:47.820
The pizza guy's hair on fire?

03:01:47.820 --> 03:01:49.820
I told him I was sorry

03:01:49.820 --> 03:01:51.820
I'm a liar

03:01:51.820 --> 03:01:56.820
So no toys for me.

03:01:56.820 --> 03:01:58.820
I don't deserve them.

03:01:58.820 --> 03:02:03.820
I couldn't wait for a big wheel as the holiday neared.

03:02:03.820 --> 03:02:08.820
But then I told my grandma that she had a beard.

03:02:08.820 --> 03:02:11.820
Dear Santa,

03:02:11.820 --> 03:02:14.820
I know what my problem is.

03:02:14.820 --> 03:02:16.820
Why it can't be good.

03:02:16.820 --> 03:02:18.820
It's a fear of intimacy.

03:02:18.820 --> 03:02:27.820
You see, my whole life, whenever I've met someone really great like you, and I keep feeling I'm getting too close to them, something inside me makes me want to screw it up.

03:02:27.820 --> 03:02:33.820
So in a weird way, the reason I'm so bad is because I love you so much, Santa.

03:02:34.820 --> 03:02:44.820
Rock and sock and robot is what I was hoping for, but then I made a death threat to Vice President Gore.

03:02:44.820 --> 03:02:50.820
Oh, Santa won't be knockin' on my door, cause he's a big, fat whore.

03:02:52.820 --> 03:02:58.820
What made me say that shoots and ladders would be so good indeed?

03:02:59.820 --> 03:03:03.820
So why'd I have to sell that copper bag of weed?

03:03:04.820 --> 03:03:08.820
So, Santa, please give me my easy plate oven.

03:03:08.820 --> 03:03:28.020
Santa won't you accept my apologies Santa can't you see, I'm begging you please

03:03:28.020 --> 03:03:31.860
Oh, Santa next year, I'll do you right.

03:03:31.860 --> 03:03:37.860
Live from New York, it's Saturday night.

03:03:37.860 --> 03:03:40.060
Yay!

03:03:40.060 --> 03:03:42.180
Thank you very much for listening,

03:03:42.180 --> 03:03:44.180
and we'll see you next week.
