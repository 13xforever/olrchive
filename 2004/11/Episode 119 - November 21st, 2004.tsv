291345	295089	An exclusive for you guys, the new Ultramix 2 songs.
295149	297291	I'm not talking about the same stuff that was on the V-Rare.
297311	298152	We already played that.
298192	300775	I'm talking about the brand new songs from Ultramix 2.
302119	303840	that isn't anywhere else on the internet yet.
304320	317226	And for instance, in this first break, we're gonna hear Tengoku, or 0.59, both, both, you know the song is both names, the Jesper Kidd mix, and then we're gonna hear the DDR edit of After All, and a new song called Altitude, all from Ultramix 2.
317826	320047	We're gonna play a whole lot of new Ultramix 2 songs.
320487	329031	Ultramix 2 is on everyone's mind this weekend, I think, if you're a DDR player, you've heard about this game, and if you're an Xbox owner, you probably own this game by now.
330140	331300	or you're getting it very soon.
331581	335302	And then, of course, on top of that, we've got all the Japanese imports as well.
335382	337023	So, a lot of big news tonight.
337403	338983	We'll get to all that after this break.
339083	339764	Let's go to it.
340604	345826	Also, whoops, I gotta remember this too, the Akira Omoka signed CD giveaway.
345866	347747	Hello, we're giving away the first CD tonight.
348007	348227	Who?
350388	353689	I would hope you'd know him, seeing as he did the song right before we came on air.
354189	356210	Yes, I lust after his musical talent.
356330	356690	There you go.
357520	358580	There's the Jamie I know.
359161	360841	And I lust after his body.
362482	363162	Oh my god!
363762	365343	Tonight is the night of revelations!
368104	369065	And that was just funny.
369365	370925	Loki lusts after a man.
373006	373286	No.
374147	374427	No, I don't.
374467	377148	Maybe that's in the same way I lust after, like, Margaret Cho.
377688	379169	You mean he's not a giant robot?
379229	382810	In the same way I lust after... I don't know.
383411	385374	I lust after teriyaki sauce.
385434	385675	Yes.
385935	387417	Oh, Benihana teriyaki sauce.
387457	388920	Yes, the way I lust after that.
389601	390422	Okay, yeah, sorry.
390462	391023	Break time.
393186	394528	We'll be right back after this.
394689	395911	Music from Ultramix 2.
396151	396712	Enjoy, you guys.
501150	503353	She knows the voices in her mind
527029	528230	Thank you for watching!
575454	576220	Thanks for watching!
625874	627037	Thanks for watching!
673230	674450	Thank you for watching!
725511	740904	Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter D, the letter A, and the number 59.
741004	746148	Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?
746835	751238	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio episode number 119 on this lovely November 21st, 2004.
751318	757761	First off, to those of you guys that are brand new to the station, tuning in for the first time, big welcome to you guys.
757781	758742	Welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.
759122	767227	I know that our rebroadcasts that are starting now over on DDR Freak on Friday nights are getting a pretty good reception, so I think we might get some new people because of that.
767687	772650	So a big thank you to you guys for tuning in over here and listening to the live experience.
772990	773390	With a shotgun.
796291	797652	with a BFG for all I care.
799453	800113	A pretty gun.
800613	803374	Anyway, in there we had some songs from Ultramix 2.
803734	805855	Brand new, playing them for the first time.
806556	809777	Loki and I just were recording those off our Xbox not too long ago.
810117	811418	Hope you guys enjoyed it.
811458	813479	Giving you guys something to check out tonight.
813579	816260	Those of you guys especially who haven't gotten a chance to check out Ultramix 2,
817216	818618	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
835555	844184	You know what's interesting is that a lot of that same feedback in the chatroom, I'm seeing a lot of... Ziz says, it just sucks that they killed Tengoku with this remix.
844964	848908	MPQ says, too much kid, not enough Tengoku.
849369	850770	Or .59, however you want to say it.
851151	857477	It's just... It really was a lot of extraneous stuff that really didn't need to be there.
857819	858340	You know what, though?
859080	860522	I'll admit, I actually kind of like it.
860622	862103	It's like one of my more favorite remixes.
862443	870671	It's different, and I can see why people don't like it, because it is so different than the original, and a lot of people consider the original to be like one of the staple Bomani songs.
870731	873994	I mean, honestly, it's in like every home 2DX version.
874014	875556	Well, not every, but almost damn near every.
875996	881562	And then, you know, it was a classic DDR song, so it's kind of like when somebody touches that and makes it different, people are kind of nervous.
882522	883703	I kind of dug it, though.
883803	888286	Certainly more so than a lot of those remixes we got on previous DDR mixes.
888366	891188	It's the same thing like what they did with the Battle Royale manga.
891968	897452	They took something that was fine the way it was, and blew it way out of proportion by Americanizing the text too much.
898032	899933	I think they Americanized the mixing too much in this.
899993	902195	It sucks.
902355	905237	It's too big, you know?
906277	908759	It was fine, simple, the way it was.
909773	917443	Well, to each their own opinion, but certainly Ultramix 2 offers something for everyone, so even if you didn't really like that song, maybe you liked After All by Delirium.
917824	921288	I would hope that you would like that song, Jamie, considering it was a former cage match pick of yours.
923010	924072	You're on Orange Lounge Radio.
924192	925574	I think she likes that song.
926254	927616	What did you guys think of that?
927636	927836	Arcadian
953241	953902	Thanks for watching!
968457	969918	Loki, put down the dating sim on the DS for a minute.
995253	996153	What do you think of Altitude?
996173	998074	That seems like the kind of song you would put in a cage match.
998114	998375	I don't know.
998395	999195	What do you think of Altitude?
999475	999975	I liked it.
1000075	1001416	It was cool.
1001436	1002697	Have you played that one on Ultimate X2 yet?
1003137	1004117	I think once.
1005158	1006138	It's different.
1006198	1011201	It's kind of cool because a lot of people are going, oh my god, finally we're getting a US exclusive song that's a 9-footer.
1011721	1015682	Of course, not only is there nine, but there's like ten UX exclusives right now, too.
1015983	1017463	What are you doing over there on the DS?
1017503	1020684	You look like you're scratching off paint or something with your stylus.
1021044	1022085	It's all black.
1023565	1026406	Oh, you're doing PictoChat and you're just making all black boxes?
1027807	1028187	Lovely.
1029507	1036110	Yes, of course, today, the 21st, being the release of the DS as well, and not only Loki, but myself had to go pick up one of these and...
1037873	1039874	I heard they were supposed to be in short supply, but I don't know.
1039894	1041474	It doesn't seem like there was much of a problem.
1041614	1043035	It wasn't that hard to find.
1043075	1044335	You guys have DSs?
1044395	1045375	Yeah, let me get one in the back.
1046416	1047336	That was difficult.
1047936	1048216	Alright.
1048536	1053077	I don't want to get too far off base here, because we have to start off the show as we start off every week's show.
1053117	1055838	Did we want to talk, since we brought up Conception?
1058239	1058459	Later.
1058559	1059139	We'll talk about it later.
1060800	1061040	Anyways.
1061240	1061520	Anyway.
1061740	1065401	Well, we have to get to How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day, because that's an Orange Laundry of Tradition, dammit.
1065461	1065961	So, Jamie...
1066889	1068630	I know you're working over there, but how was your week?
1068670	1069130	How was your day?
1069710	1070610	My week was shit.
1071651	1072271	Oh, I'm sorry.
1072631	1073852	My day was half shit.
1079254	1081114	I normally enjoy being female.
1081675	1082935	This is one of the days I don't.
1084456	1085976	I think I know where this is going, okay?
1086036	1087197	I'm not going to say anything else.
1088197	1090818	I've been in a crappy, crappy mood all day.
1091488	1097133	I overslept, and then it took quite a bit for me to be happy again today.
1097434	1111707	So, I am now in a better mood than I've been all day, thanks to the power of good conversation, and coffee, and salty food.
1114169	1115550	I normally hate salty food.
1115790	1117272	I went out and got me some hot dogs.
1119042	1121203	Super Salty Hot Dogs from the 7-Eleven.
1142242	1144843	I don't know, the rest of the week was kind of okay.
1144863	1148165	I've been mostly gearing up toward my trip to Alabama.
1148185	1154829	I'm not going to be here next week because I'm going to be in Alabama and not here.
1156070	1162853	Although I will have my laptop with me and there may be some Skype potential if I can find a reliable broadband.
1163714	1165635	That's next week's show you're not going to be here?
1165655	1167676	Yeah, I'm sort of going to be in another state.
1168447	1169367	Yeah, I know, I know.
1169467	1170347	That happened to me once this year.
1170427	1172768	I'm going to come back with like a fro because I cut my hair short.
1174008	1175649	And the humidity is going to make it all poof up.
1175829	1176529	It's going to be funny.
1176549	1179849	Are you going to come back with a little bit of southern accent?
1180470	1182070	I thought I already had a bit of one.
1183130	1184290	It's not that strong, though.
1184470	1187391	I never really had much of one to begin with.
1188371	1195213	And now today, during the show, I'm going to be kind of quiet because I'm doing a paper on a focus on ethics for business law.
1196053	1196293	You?
1196533	1196893	Ethics?
1198254	1200215	Okay, you can shut up right now, okay?
1200335	1200955	I'm just teasing.
1200975	1201815	I have ethics.
1201975	1203856	I have... some.
1204176	1208098	No, DarkSakura has always been a really good place to go for advice, you know?
1208498	1211639	Dear DarkSakura, I'm feeling a little sad today.
1212019	1212639	What should I do?
1213180	1214120	Get the fuck over it!
1215120	1215741	Exactly!
1216481	1218362	Of course, that's not really ethics, but I don't know.
1218482	1220742	You told me to shut the fuck up, and I feel better already.
1220782	1225144	Dear DarkSakura... Okay, Dear DarkSakura, I stole a dollar out of my mommy's purse.
1225944	1226565	What should I do?
1226745	1227345	Give it to me!
1229053	1229613	There we go.
1232014	1233274	Me and my fucked up morals.
1234354	1240656	But nah, I'm gonna... It's gonna be cool because I'm gonna go see my mama's son.
1241376	1244337	And I'm gonna see a bunch of my friends.
1245098	1249019	Actually, a few people from DDR Freak are gonna be coming down to see me.
1249619	1250259	Yay, Freak!
1252120	1255080	And I figure maybe I'll get some interviews or something.
1255480	1257181	Or a statement from various people's.
1257509	1257990	Please do.
1258090	1262697	We do want some statements on record from some of our pals in Alabama and the surrounding areas.
1263999	1266843	So that's pretty much it.
1268285	1268706	Alright.
1268886	1269387	Sounds good to me.
1272558	1274579	I prefer to call those make fun of the customer buttons.
1298885	1301325	See, unfortunately, we don't have make fun of the listener buttons.
1301565	1303106	So, you know, we don't have that.
1303126	1304166	We can't afford cough buttons.
1304486	1307907	So if I just cough in your ear and blow out your speaker, my apologies.
1307987	1308447	But I'm sick.
1308467	1308727	Get over it.
1308747	1309587	I totally agree with you, Rob.
1309647	1309927	Click.
1309967	1311187	Those listeners are stupid.
1311247	1311547	Click.
1313968	1314328	Oh, wait.
1315608	1316008	Just kidding.
1316128	1316408	Click.
1316448	1316768	Shut up.
1316788	1318228	We get a dollar for everyone that listens.
1318288	1318548	Click.
1319309	1319689	Just kidding.
1319729	1319989	I wish.
1320309	1320569	All right.
1320829	1321609	Loki, how was your week?
1321629	1322029	How was your day?
1322729	1323489	My week was all right.
1323789	1325030	It was pretty uneventful.
1325490	1326970	I tried playing Grand Theft Auto.
1327896	1336883	MyStyle, which includes cheating, and my GameShark 2 crapped out on me, so I bought a new codebreaker today.
1336963	1338444	Cheaters never prosper.
1338945	1344409	No, shitty software... Oh, what do you mean, cheaters never prosper?
1344489	1345390	Bush got elected.
1346671	1351255	Anyways, so... Wow.
1351775	1355398	Anyways, so... Today, we got...
1356144	1356825	DM DM DM DM DM DM
1370990	1372031	Literally six feet away.
1372191	1372391	Yes.
1373051	1373771	Not even six feet.
1373831	1379334	Loki was sitting on the couch, which you can see on cam, and I was sitting in the Jamie's seat, which you can't see on cam, but it's really close.
1379974	1381415	On the other side of the coffee table.
1381435	1391620	We were playing PictoChat and writing dirty words like vagina and things on the PictoChat and drawing middle fingers to each other and stuff, and it was hilarious.
1391660	1392961	This is what the DS was made for.
1392981	1394581	I love the DS just for that.
1395322	1398023	That is the best feature right now.
1398533	1409444	Well, actually, it was really cool, because we were playing Metroid Prime Hunters at the demo at Best Buy, and I gotta say, the control on it's awesome.
1409524	1411406	It's just really smart.
1411446	1412467	I'm having issues with it.
1412848	1413688	It's too much for me.
1414725	1416586	I miss my Atari joystick, okay?
1417066	1417546	One button!
1418147	1419147	One button for everything!
1419167	1435175	Now, now, I like it, I like it, but it cramps up my hand like a bitch because you have to hold it in a really weird way, and so, like, my finger's all fucked up from trying to reach around to the back to, you know, push the, uh, L button, and it's just like... Sounds dirty.
1435255	1436715	Can't quite get the reach around, huh?
1437976	1442238	I guess, yeah, whatever, anyways, um, so, other than that, um...
1443291	1444352	I don't know, what else did I do?
1444672	1446913	Oh, we went to Benny Hoff's today and that rocked.
1447353	1454717	Because we were going to go to some cheapo teriyaki bowl place and they ended up not being open on Sunday.
1454737	1456238	What kind of restaurant is closed on Sunday?
1456839	1457779	Religious restaurants?
1457979	1458439	Chick-fil-A.
1459800	1460321	Seriously?
1460381	1461601	I know Chick-fil-A is closed on Sunday.
1461621	1462822	They don't have Chick-fil-A here though.
1463302	1464343	They have one in Solano.
1464923	1465583	That's not here.
1465604	1467384	I'm going to go eat at Chick-fil-A in Alabama.
1467605	1468105	Okay, done.
1470862	1475544	Anyways, so... Well, yeah, well, I'm going to go to South Sac and eat at Popeye's, dodgeball.
1475584	1477804	I could eat at five Popeye's in Mobile.
1478705	1479045	Sorry, Logie.
1479065	1481025	Yeah, sorry, but not really.
1484046	1488948	So, anyways, so, yeah, it's pretty much a lot of Final Fantasy.
1489348	1492949	I've leveled my white mage up, like, five levels or so.
1493970	1494230	Addict.
1495190	1495810	And, um...
1499113	1499473	What else?
1500494	1502014	Not really much else other than that.
1502575	1505616	We got Ultramix 2, so I watch people play that.
1506216	1510958	And that's pretty much it for right now, yeah.
1511158	1511579	I think so.
1512599	1512939	Alright.
1513620	1515921	RKDN42, how was your week?
1515941	1516301	How was your day?
1517121	1518362	My week was kind of eh.
1519082	1522183	I was sick most of the week with a cold, but it was working.
1522223	1523664	It wasn't that bad.
1523684	1528066	It was just sniffly all week and so forth, and it did work.
1528885	1534309	Then, went on Tuesday, went and got my smog test for my car, so I can get full registration.
1535069	1543815	Then, after doing that on Thursday, I went down to the courthouse to see if I could pay off my ticket for the registration thing, hopefully.
1544135	1547657	Oh yes, and that was the one you got after this show, a couple weeks ago, yes, alright.
1548418	1556743	But you said that I need the final registration, or have to go to DMV or something, so they extended the date, so I have until next month to get all that done.
1557574	1560996	Hopefully that will still be corrected and I only have to pay $10.
1561076	1564739	I said $191, which would be a bitch if I had to do that.
1566500	1571744	Then I paid some 2DX this week and ordered 8th Style on Wednesday.
1571764	1573705	You're going to get 8th Style before me, Cry?
1573725	1576867	Yeah, well it's probably going to be like two weeks or so, I don't know.
1577127	1580890	Because I ordered from YesAsia and they don't have them in stock at the moment.
1581331	1585555	I definitely want to play some of the 8th style consumer stuff tonight because there's a song on there I love so much.
1585575	1587876	I'm going to be getting mine from PlayAsia.
1588237	1589938	Everybody's getting 8th style but me crying.
1589958	1591199	I'm just going to be getting it for Christmas.
1591239	1593541	And I still don't have 7th style crying.
1593962	1599366	It's either 8th style or I think I'm getting a tablet because I'm changing my major to an art major.
1599826	1600027	Okay.
1600047	1603189	Let's see.
1603509	1604871	Didn't do much else.
1605071	1606332	Played a bit more 2DX today.
1606772	1607633	Came here yesterday and
1608243	1609444	Hey, Spring of Trivia!
1636377	1645283	Spike TV is the most intelligent station I've ever seen because they are bringing... You said Spike TV and intelligent in the same sentence.
1645463	1650766	Listen, they have a good video game awards show and they're bringing Japanese game shows over here to America.
1650887	1653488	And reruns of Blind Date 24 hours a day.
1653568	1654129	Exactly!
1654169	1655109	That fucking rocks!
1655329	1656430	And you know what else they have?
1656670	1658952	World's Wildest Police Chases.
1659012	1660733	And we watch that every fucking day.
1661253	1662114	And that's awesome.
1662574	1664516	So they have really kick-ass TV.
1664836	1664996	But...
1665596	1688216	Hey Spring of Trivia, it's the weirdest show you'll ever see, it's just a trivia show, it's not really a game show And the winners at the end, they win bread Sounds like one of our giveaways And it's great though because one of the trivia things was Mozart wrote a song called Lick My Ass
1689033	1697201	And he actually did write a song called Lick My Ass And then they performed the song Lick My Ass Which was translated into English And it was great, it was like um
1697850	1701011	You know, wonderful sensation, lick my ass.
1703633	1704133	It was great.
1704693	1708295	You just have to watch that show, it's great.
1708355	1719379	You know what, having taken quite a bit of music history, when I first started college, because I started off as a music major, that doesn't surprise me one single bit.
1720180	1722741	You know what, Vox said it right though.
1724724	1726705	Lick My Ass is a wonderful sensation.
1727345	1727625	No.
1729145	1729685	Mozart.
1729765	1730625	Oh, Mozart.
1730645	1731066	Never mind.
1731786	1732246	Whoever.
1732946	1733666	The dead guy.
1734226	1746089	You know, that's what... See, Taka needs to now, you know, take that song and, you know, put it into, like, another renaissance song for, like, you know, 2DX Blue or whatever the next one's gonna be.
1747610	1747970	Gold.
1748890	1749350	Anyways.
1749370	1750070	2DX Yellow.
1750130	1751631	Oh, and one more thing.
1751851	1752591	This will be the last thing.
1753987	1754748	DERBY OWNERS CLUB
1775342	1777663	For once, we have the cool game on the block.
1777683	1779124	Actually, we have Disney's Rave, too, for weather.
1779424	1781605	But for twice, we have the cool game on the block.
1781865	1784166	I really, really hope they can keep it in good shape this time.
1784326	1785887	I gave poop to a small child.
1787136	1788817	Well, the coin slots are a little iffy.
1788857	1789278	Wait, wait, wait.
1789558	1791119	How did you give poop to a small child?
1791419	1795362	I bred some of Iguana Girl's horses because I missed having my specials.
1795743	1798245	The first one I built was an albino, so I named it Shiroi.
1798265	1799065	It was a female.
1801167	1805470	If it was a male, I would have named it Michael Jackson or something because I think its parent was Latoya Jackson.
1805851	1807332	Okay.
1808012	1809714	No, it was one of her half-and-halves.
1809754	1813096	Anyway, my second one came out all gray, so I named him Poop.
1813937	1815138	And I gave him to a small child.
1816391	1819672	and then my last one was a panda, so I named it Gungurl.
1821233	1822953	Here, have some poop, little child.
1823854	1824854	Oh, you should have seen the kid.
1824874	1826695	I was like, here, I named my horse Poop.
1826715	1827335	You can have him.
1827375	1828355	And the kid just grinned.
1832537	1833377	I got poop!
1835198	1837539	He just had that hey, hey, hey grin.
1837899	1840340	Can you imagine the parents getting the phone call?
1841653	1844355	Could you tell your child not to bring poop to school again?
1846076	1846376	Sorry.
1848138	1851200	But yeah, we gotta start him young in the life of horse racing.
1851740	1853061	And, you know, betting on tracks.
1855243	1856324	Anyways, I'm done.
1856364	1857244	Go, baby, go!
1857825	1861888	Explicit joined us during that first commercial break, and you know he's always got a lot to say.
1862948	1863309	What's up?
1863349	1863789	How was your week?
1863829	1864269	How was your day?
1864950	1865450	Very good.
1865490	1868652	Had to take a few tests this week.
1869013	1870694	Practically passed all of them.
1871932	1875033	and I actually finally played Derby's Owners Club at RVGL.
1875173	1876193	Go, baby, go!
1877253	1878353	Go, baby, go!
1879153	1881254	And it's about time RVGL got onto my good side.
1883034	1883314	Yeah.
1883434	1885295	I still haven't gone there yet.
1885355	1886395	I'm still a little scared.
1887255	1889656	That place, Bomani Games go and they die there.
1890056	1895557	I'm scared that when I go there, Derby Owners Club is going to have like two monitors missing and it's going to make me cry.
1895677	1898697	Or kids stealing the... Or kids breaking all the TV.
1899458	1899938	Seriously.
1900358	1901538	Graffiti or something, I don't know.
1901897	1903799	Oh, and finally got the DS.
1905840	1906301	You too, huh?
1907181	1909143	Yeah, the pictograph.
1909163	1916669	Were you here when we were talking about how Loki and I were sitting just six feet from each other, writing vagina and sending middle finger pictures back and forth?
1916709	1917369	I just got here.
1919051	1921213	And I'm hiding right now with my fuck you hat.
1922814	1924315	You have to put that on cam so they can see.
1924375	1931061	Cam over at www.orangenautorated.com If you can't see the hat that Explicit is wearing, it says fuck you in sign language.
1931221	1931601	It's pretty nice.
1932625	1933105	Yeah.
1934426	1934766	Yeah.
1934846	1936127	Right now I have metric point hunters.
1936167	1937588	It feels pretty good so far.
1937608	1939889	It's just hard to get used to, really.
1940109	1941970	Are you having problems with the reach around like Loki is?
1942951	1943271	Not really.
1943291	1944491	I actually got used to it very quickly.
1944892	1945152	Okay.
1946052	1946512	I can shoot.
1946893	1950254	It's just shooting is the big problem.
1950315	1950935	That's the only thing.
1953216	1953736	That is all.
1956018	1957318	Sorry.
1958679	1961040	Does everything have to be about gay sex, really?
1963331	1963771	Yes!
1963791	1969734	Now you're making me think DS stands for dual sexuality.
1969754	1973336	I thought DS stood for me!
1974956	1975677	Fuck y'all!
1976737	1977097	Okay.
1978578	1982420	I have no other real material tonight, so I resort to Dick Fargage sex jokes.
1982480	1983100	I'm sorry, you guys.
1984040	1985681	Yeah, how does it feel to have... I'm offended.
1985721	1986502	I need to sue.
1986902	1987122	How does...
1987967	1990069	Go ahead, you ain't gonna get blood out of a turnip, honey.
1991129	1991910	Oh, you mean the DS?
1991990	1993852	Oh, I thought you meant me, my dick and fart and gay sex jokes.
1993892	1994152	No.
1994452	1994552	Oh.
1995373	1996253	I'm offended!
1996273	1998775	How does it feel to have a game system named after you?
2000116	2004239	My ego is gargantuan, like the size of the King of All Cosmos' package.
2006881	2012886	I have decided, by the way, speaking of that, that I'm going to cosplay as the Little Prince, with a big ball of stuff.
2014908	2016629	I should cosplay as the King, that would rock.
2016860	2019142	You know, actually I forgot I did do something else yesterday.
2020063	2021284	I went to the Wreck-It-Con kickoff.
2021564	2022044	Oh, how was that?
2022445	2023906	It was pretty good.
2024066	2025788	What is Wreck-It-Con for those who don't live in California?
2025808	2030151	It's a local anime con, one of the smaller ones at one of the schools in Pittsburgh, California.
2031192	2032533	But it was pretty cool.
2032573	2033314	I had a good time.
2033554	2034835	I want to go again this year.
2034955	2036236	They moved the date though, didn't they?
2036757	2037237	March, I think.
2037517	2037898	I want to go.
2038398	2041481	But I got a fantasy star online art book.
2042081	2045244	I picked up a record, which I need to bring over here to rip the audio from.
2045802	2046723	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2066241	2067543	Ask Orange Lounge Live
2079392	2080032	I'll talk to him.
2080192	2080672	All right, cool.
2081032	2085354	But I just, you know, seeing all the costumes, I was like, you know what, that's what I should do.
2085414	2089875	And someone suggested, by the way, I got a free copy of The Sims 2, which I'm giving to Iguana Girl.
2091155	2097337	But I'm going to be, he gave me some ideas for a skit I can do for The Masquerade.
2098934	2103516	And that would be put little Lego houses and stuff on the ground and roll over it with a giant ball.
2103776	2107737	They have this big display behind me that sees legs in this humongous package.
2110238	2110498	Awesome.
2110718	2115300	You know if they do put Katamari Damacy on the DS, the king will have to be both screens.
2115580	2117500	His package will take up the entire lower screen.
2117941	2118861	That would be awesome.
2119741	2127764	Although I'm wondering how one so endowed could come out with something so tiny.
2129051	2131953	I should be getting the game, the Japanese version, in a day or two.
2133694	2135716	Got it off eBay for about the same price as it cost me.
2135916	2137277	Oh wait, so you bought the Japanese version?
2137557	2137757	Yeah.
2137857	2138317	Oh, very cool.
2139158	2142960	Of course, they didn't change much, so, except the words, but hey.
2143801	2145782	Alright, my week and my day was pretty good.
2146203	2148864	I didn't do a whole lot of Bomani playing, well, except for Ultramix 2.
2148904	2152567	I've actually done a lot of DDR playing in the past three days, but I'll get into that a little bit later.
2153047	2157030	I did not go out to Roseville Golf Land with the others on, what, like Wednesday or something?
2157050	2157090	No.
2157731	2159873	I don't know, I was supposed to go on a date the other night and I got ditched.
2160053	2162216	So, you know, life sucks sometimes, but what can you do?
2162757	2165280	Although, I got an apology today, so that made me feel a little better.
2165940	2170826	And one of my really, really good friends is in the hospital for the second time this week.
2171006	2175111	So, Christopher, I know you're not listening, but I'm thinking about you and I hope you feel better soon.
2176653	2177114	Also...
2178815	2182816	I went and got the DS with Matt today and I've been really enjoying that as well.
2182916	2185498	And Benihana is one thing that Loki didn't say about Benihana.
2185518	2186658	That was only my second time there.
2187098	2188959	But you know what's really weird about when you go to Benihana?
2188979	2191640	When you go to most restaurants, you sit at your own table, right?
2191981	2199044	But at Benihana, you kind of have to like share a table with other people because they sit like seven or eight people at a table because of the fact they only have so many chefs.
2199884	2200785	Thank you for watching!
2222970	2225612	So, of course, we want to talk a whole lot about Ultramix 2.
2225932	2228914	We want to get your input over the Skype line.
2228954	2232717	If you go over to www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on Interact With Us.
2233077	2234779	We're going to take some of your calls in a little bit.
2235239	2236280	But first, let's go to a break.
2236300	2238141	We still have a lot of music going to play for you guys tonight.
2238201	2242344	As I said earlier in the show, we've got so many Ultramix 2 songs we want to debut for you guys tonight.
2243105	2250830	I don't think anybody else has these right now, so we're playing them for you guys and getting your thoughts on it as well over the Skype line.
2250971	2252652	And we'll talk about Ultramix 2 when we come back.
2253092	2254913	From this, you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
2256454	2257815	This is how the story goes
2287123	2287524	and many more.
2311857	2312977	Thank you for watching!
2338257	2340179	Thank you for watching!
2389047	2397249	Let me tell you something you don't know Let me tell you something you don't know
2419637	2423386	Let me tell you something you don't know
2568741	2569962	Orange Lounge Radio.
2570302	2576466	We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.
2577827	2579929	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
2579969	2581910	Hope you enjoyed some of the music there in that break.
2582030	2582831	All from Ultramix 2.
2583031	2587574	We had a song, you should know this one, Brick House by the Commodores.
2587734	2589355	Finally making its way into a DDR game.
2589375	2589935	That's a great one.
2590656	2596900	After that was a group called Creo with a song called Burning For You, which is kind of a, I think it's one of the sleeper hits of the mix, honestly.
2596940	2597580	It's one of those songs.
2599198	2600179	Catch It by Total Science
2615495	2618097	which is a song I don't particularly care for so much.
2618498	2623863	And DarkSakura is discovering the wonders of pictochat with Loki on the DS right now.
2623883	2624904	What are you guys drawing pictures of?
2624944	2626685	My artwork is pretty damn good on this thing.
2627146	2628186	I'm going to put it up on the cam.
2628607	2630188	You can try, but it looks really blurry.
2630629	2632891	I can go try to put it up on the cam, but you're going to have to chat while I do it.
2632911	2635033	Okay.
2635053	2641919	You need to... I drew a picture of a toilet.
2646738	2649241	Yeah, you can barely see it, but it's coming out okay.
2650282	2657750	Loki sent me a picture of a turd, and I sent him a picture of my horse, and he sent me a picture of glue, and I sent him a picture of a toilet.
2661435	2663157	Here, take that foul thing back.
2663177	2664138	I'm supposed to be doing my homework.
2666121	2670865	I was going to say, I found a way to distract DarkSakura from her homework.
2671205	2672106	Show her Pictochat.
2672346	2678511	And now Loki is drawing, he's repeatedly sending me pictures of him holding a gun, shooting RVGL children.
2678651	2679612	That's like the third one he sent.
2679652	2681593	Alright, I'm turning this off.
2682074	2682854	We got a show to do.
2684115	2687118	I'm just, I'm really scared about the next, like, anime con.
2688340	2691564	or better yet DDR Tournament with all these DS's.
2691604	2697270	There's gonna be like every kid on the block's gonna have their DS there and drawing naughty pictures back and forth.
2698672	2702136	Did you like how there's a big old warning in the DS manual about parents?
2703097	2707442	You should advise your children if they're under 15 about the warnings of chatting with strangers.
2708996	2716662	When picking a name, make sure it's gender neutral.
2717142	2718603	I didn't understand the reasoning behind that.
2718704	2721185	So dirty old men can't pick up on you?
2721666	2722466	With a DS.
2722827	2726470	Seriously, if you're a dirty old man hitting on girls on a DS, you're sad.
2726950	2728531	Desperation.
2730252	2730833	Let's see, here it is.
2731297	2733399	This is on page 10 of the manual.
2734160	2735982	Important privacy information.
2736362	2740447	Nintendo DS wireless communication, including PictoChat, is not monitored.
2740607	2742589	In other words, they're saying this is not Xbox.
2743410	2746293	This means PictoChat does not block messages from strangers.
2746733	2752800	Similar to unmonitored internet chat rooms, children should be warned about receiving messages from or communicating with strangers.
2753829	2761095	Up to 15 other DS users within range of your Nintendo DS may be able to view your nickname and messages within a selected chatroom at any one time.
2761135	2765638	I hope to God, because we live in an apartment complex with four buildings around here.
2766419	2768881	There's kids over there and they got video games.
2769501	2772544	Mommy, Mommy, give me PiktoChat, give me DS!
2773644	2774485	Oh, I can't wait.
2774785	2776507	Oh, hey, who's this chatting on here?
2777447	2778028	Penis.
2782765	2790871	and it goes on to say, an adult should assist children with a system setup and instruct them not to use personal information and not meet strangers.
2791412	2794094	Okay, that's the part I don't get because how far does the DS work?
2794154	2795375	Like, it's only like 30 feet.
2795815	2797777	So chances are you're already by the stranger.
2797817	2799458	But, but, not necessarily because...
2800118	2803300	30 feet, and I think that you can ping off of each other.
2803320	2804641	I think.
2804661	2805722	That would be something else.
2808904	2812346	Or give personal information to anyone because it could be read by a stranger.
2812406	2815888	So don't put your credit card number on PictoChat, okay?
2816148	2820470	Okay, 15-year-olds, don't put your credit card number or your social security on PictoChat.
2820851	2821751	You know, wait, wait, wait.
2821931	2822792	What?
2823712	2826254	Let me be the first one to say this right now, okay?
2826274	2826354	Okay.
2827742	2832223	You're going to see an article within, I'm going to give it like three months.
2833324	2836545	Kids caught in school using the DSs to cheat on tests.
2836585	2837045	Seriously.
2837585	2839885	You know what, they could already do it though, with cell phone text messaging.
2840106	2840926	I've already heard of that one.
2841506	2848528	In fact, even, because it's not a huge secret, I'm a teacher in my day job, except I teach adults, and adults are just as bad as children.
2849868	2851389	But they use email.
2851809	2854029	They'll use their email system to email each other during tests.
2854069	2854650	I have to watch them.
2855450	2855790	It's sad.
2857839	2858499	Not everybody.
2858779	2861700	I'm talking about one or two bad apples spoiling the bunch, obviously.
2863561	2867702	Whatever date you choose to enter as your month or day of birth, year is not asked for.
2868743	2872504	An it's your birthday message will be communicated in the chat room on that date.
2873964	2878486	For more information, visit Nintendo.com slash consumer slash DS privacy.
2879606	2882207	That's some good reading, if you're ever really poor.
2882327	2884768	I love how the little warning comes up every time you turn that on.
2885548	2887389	Be sure to look into the health risks
2887870	2888910	We're playing the DS.
2890771	2891891	DS causes cancer.
2893391	2896312	Anyway, back to the big Bomani news from this week.
2896532	2900193	Ultramix 2, DDR Ultramix 2 hitting the Xbox.
2900853	2908534	I know a lot of us have gotten a chance to play it on yesterday, 20 November, during the special, and some of us have been playing it throughout the weekend.
2908895	2911435	Loki, what did you think of Ultramix 2 overall?
2912035	2912395	It was good.
2912675	2915736	It was definitely a good mix of
2917202	2919663	Basically, it's almost all new stuff anyways.
2920624	2921784	And they did a really good job on it.
2921904	2923185	Really good job putting it together.
2925466	2929387	I was under the impression that there'd be more actual videos for these songs.
2929487	2934709	Like, you know, not this random shit, but eh, it's okay.
2935870	2937170	But the steps seem pretty good.
2939571	2943973	Really, I didn't have too many complaints about it.
2944680	2947362	Except maybe, like, you know, bomb mode was kind of stupid.
2949503	2954627	Some of, like, the, you know, extra party stuff's kind of, eh, but whatever.
2954887	2957249	It's, I mean, it's different.
2959290	2962012	That's pretty much all it is, yeah.
2962412	2963393	I like it so far, though.
2963413	2964934	Okay, what about Songless?
2965566	2966748	Songlist was very good.
2967229	2974043	I like all this stuff that you haven't heard before, like the new remixes and this stuff from a different drum.
2974203	2975466	Very good decision there.
2975800	2980242	Oh, whoever decided to hook up with a different drum for the songs, bless you.
2980482	2982143	Bless your little heart a million times over.
2982323	2984123	That was the most genius idea for DDR.
2984444	2984804	Seriously.
2985144	2990666	That was as good as the original idea to hook up with Toshiba EMI in Japan for Dance Mania.
2991006	2997689	And I know I've said it on this show before, that all DDR needed was to hook up with another record label, just like Toshiba EMI in Japan.
2997749	2999550	Hook up with a record label here and get some good songs.
2999630	3001871	And thank God, somebody finally listened.
3001911	3005372	Of course, I know they probably weren't really listening to me, but somebody else thought of the idea.
3005912	3008734	and hooray, it had great effects on DDR.
3008814	3011316	I think the different drum stuff is the best music in the game.
3013298	3021123	Anyway, Arcadian, what are your thoughts on Ultramix 2 being a DDR mostly import fanatic, but how do you like this domestic release?
3021183	3021864	Yeah, it was pretty good.
3022404	3027688	I would definitely say it was probably the best US mix that I've seen.
3027888	3029430	Yeah, it probably is the best US mix.
3029670	3031331	Yeah, a lot of cool new stuff and
3032531	3036055	I saw on some of the videos for the new stuff, they have the website of the people.
3037097	3039680	A lot of this stuff is pretty good.
3039760	3041823	I'd want to actually check out the bands that did them.
3043092	3046294	Which I'm sure if any bands ever heard that, they'd be very happy to hear that.
3046374	3048875	You know, having their songs in DDR gets them the extra exposure.
3049235	3052117	I mean, honestly, never heard of Echo Image.
3052537	3054478	Never heard of them before they were in Ultramix 2.
3054798	3056619	And now, I am a huge fan of them.
3056699	3058360	I know most of the people that do this show.
3058800	3060981	I know we've gotten tons of listeners in on that band.
3061061	3062422	I mean, it's great.
3062682	3065803	I mean, it's been great promotion for not just them, but other bands too.
3066364	3068485	I know there's a lot of Day Behavior fans and stuff too, so.
3069085	3070286	But, anyway.
3072327	3072847	Yes, Jamie?
3073650	3075591	Nothing, I just don't think the sentence makes sense.
3076712	3078253	Oh, you want to read that sentence?
3078873	3083815	It was Mr. Sucker's contention that this violated the implied warranty of merchantability.
3084696	3086057	Does that sound correct?
3086257	3087637	It's big words, but it sounds fine to me.
3087898	3088218	Okay.
3088698	3090679	I didn't mean to interrupt the Vimani discussion.
3090699	3092860	I just had an agonizing moment over my own grammar.
3092920	3094681	Have you gotten a chance to play Ultramix 2 at all?
3094861	3094981	No.
3095262	3095562	Okay.
3095642	3097803	I haven't had a chance to do anything.
3098863	3102025	You'll have a chance before next week's show, or two weeks' show, hopefully.
3102186	3104687	Well, I'm hoping to get some time in.
3105327	3109390	Of course, it's probably going to be after I get back from Alabama.
3111111	3111471	Gotcha.
3111852	3113152	But I've had other priorities.
3113673	3114093	Fair enough.
3114373	3115594	But money can't always come first.
3116594	3117155	Well, it could.
3117355	3126761	I left work early on Friday and ran over to Game Crazy to try and find the game, and all they had were the bundles, so I went over to GameStop instead.
3126781	3126981	Good.
3127611	3128692	Go to GameStop first.
3129372	3130113	You make me cry.
3130133	3132314	It's just the GameStop people are always hounding me.
3132334	3134836	Then go to the one at VOG Network.
3134856	3136357	It's too far of a drive.
3136537	3138118	Well, then tell me and I'll go.
3138198	3139499	Fine.
3139519	3139839	Hey.
3139859	3140340	Alright.
3142941	3143282	Sorry.
3143462	3144462	I'm crying.
3144563	3145203	No, you're not.
3145283	3145743	No, you're not.
3147745	3149486	Anything else you want to say about Ultramix 2, Arcadian?
3149506	3151187	Yeah, and the backgrounds are seizureific.
3151968	3156851	And if you play it for like over an hour or so, you'll start to get a headache if you have those on.
3157899	3159079	I disagree, actually.
3159099	3167922	I think in the past three days, I've played more DDR than I have since I, like, first got into the game, or, like, I would say after 4th Mix was new in arcades.
3167962	3168042	Huh?
3168082	3169882	Oh, no, I have that set.
3189114	3189614	Sorry about that.
3189734	3195375	I've played more DDR in the past three days than I have since I first probably played fourth or fifth mix, honestly.
3196335	3197716	That's how much I'm into this mix.
3198016	3203437	And I haven't had a seizure yet, but I agree that the backgrounds are really bright and it makes sudden mode very difficult.
3203577	3204737	I had a seizure yesterday.
3205337	3205577	What?
3206177	3206537	I'm kidding.
3206817	3213078	They just seem to try to throw as much shit on the screen as possible so you'll screw up and miss the arrows.
3213298	3216919	You'll lose an arrow in all the busyness of the screen.
3217389	3218669	and in challenge mode, that can be a bitch.
3220990	3222731	You can trim the videos off, people.
3222971	3225272	I know, but it's not, it's much fun that way.
3225972	3227433	What was up with Rage?
3227873	3233615	First off, having ginormous hair and second, dancing like a fucking woman.
3235275	3236596	Well, he did in fourth mix.
3237576	3238656	He had Emmys dances.
3238696	3243398	I have a feeling they only have one template for all the dance moves, so they're gender neutral dance moves.
3243418	3245879	I don't know, that was all right.
3247805	3250167	Explicit, anything you wanted to share on Ultramix 2?
3251388	3252068	Oh, he hasn't played it yet.
3252649	3256051	Well, I haven't really played it yet, but I'll probably most likely play it this week.
3257412	3259673	If I can find anyone who has Ultramix 2.
3259733	3260274	Very cool.
3261434	3262775	Anything else you wanted to say, Arcadian?
3262815	3264917	You look like you had another thought you wanted to finish or something.
3266141	3267042	What?
3267442	3267902	What, Loki?
3267982	3269543	Oh, the tournament we did on 20 November?
3270084	3274347	Yeah, unfortunately not a whole lot of people on Xbox Live just yet.
3274967	3282392	We tried doing a big tournament on Xbox Live yesterday, and we managed to finally get four people, a four-person tournament.
3282852	3283373	It was awesome.
3283753	3289857	But here's my advice to you guys that play the tournaments on Xbox Live, change the song, or else you'll play the whole song the whole tournament.
3291085	3291666	Get It All
3320908	3326292	And speaking of songpacks, songpack 7 is on the way out.
3326813	3328294	And we know some of the songs are going to be in that.
3328314	3331116	A lot of classic DDR songs, everything from end of the century to era.
3331156	3334759	And a brand new song, I feel, the Junk Circuit mix.
3334819	3335500	But unfortunately...
3336482	3346347	From what we understand, the song pack has been submitted, but it has not been added by Microsoft yet, which has been the case for a lot of previous song packs from DDR Ultramix.
3346367	3347247	So hopefully soon.
3348088	3351670	I would honestly check Monday, because I bet you Microsoft will add them on Monday.
3351710	3352050	We'll see.
3352810	3353230	We shall see.
3356115	3362537	As far as my personal thoughts on the mix, like I said, I've played this game more in the past three days than any DDR mix in a long, long time.
3362717	3363598	I really like it.
3364078	3372240	I love the fact that now it feels like DDR is not just being copies of Japanese mixes.
3372300	3376742	And by that I mean, you know how when you run a copy on the copier and then you copy it again?
3377282	3377983	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
3397498	3400321	But with Ultramix 2, I think a lot of people really didn't know what to expect.
3400901	3410691	It got slammed a lot after E3 because the interface was kind of weird and, you know, the song list was not all that hot at the time because they were keeping all the good stuff under wraps, but boy.
3411828	3416031	When they hooked up with a different drum and got all the new songs, it's just absolutely amazing.
3416051	3418633	And the Xbox Live stuff, phenomenal.
3418693	3421755	Having the edit steps online is great.
3422376	3432483	I would say the only downsides I've seen so far to the game is maybe I'm still noticing some frame rate issues in some songs.
3432883	3435245	It's not a huge deal.
3435445	3436726	No, it's a big deal.
3437306	3439128	With the videos running, it is big.
3440186	3444451	But, you know, if that really bothers you, turn off the videos, and I'm sure they'll fix it.
3460253	3461154	I had trouble with the controller, too.
3461174	3462534	I'd be hitting stuff, and it wouldn't register.
3462554	3463075	So, that was annoying.
3484636	3491667	I think a lot of people were saying that they were a little concerned about the steps when they first heard that new people are making the steps.
3492438	3495581	You know, longtime DDR fans, and oh, who knows what that could be.
3495661	3499764	And I think there were some people out there that were even dogging on it.
3500185	3503908	Makers of another game were dogging on the DDR Ultramix 2 stuff.
3503928	3506590	Which is really fucking unprofessional, excuse me.
3506670	3508692	Well, yeah, we already discussed that on a previous episode.
3508712	3509492	I'm not going to go there again.
3509572	3516718	But I believe it was Cutris on DDR Freak said something about those folks are eating a nice slice of humble pie right now.
3516758	3518380	And I thought that was a very good way of putting it because...
3518940	3520681	People are just loving the steps.
3520721	3524884	I honestly have not heard really bad things about the steps yet.
3525385	3528527	Which, in every DDR mix, what's the first thing that people knock?
3528887	3529148	Steps.
3529648	3530348	Every DDR mix.
3530809	3531830	But not this one so far.
3532330	3537694	Granted, there's been a couple people saying, oh, you know, some of the songs are AAA-able and the timing window is meh.
3537994	3540356	But that timing window and the steps aren't the same to me, you know.
3540856	3545479	Clearly, the person that was working on Sound Pack 6 was not working on this game.
3546180	3546240	Ha!
3546740	3548001	and thank heavens for that.
3548721	3548981	Yes.
3549101	3556024	And it's been really neat to see the edit mode stuff online too because some folks over from the DDR Freak thread are already uploading all the Oni edits.
3556124	3557065	I saw some of those on there.
3557905	3558846	I downloaded a few of them.
3558866	3559566	It was pretty cool.
3559866	3563668	The only thing I had a problem with is they kind of tucked that away.
3564498	3586130	I agree it was not as easy to find as it should have been, but... And plus, I think it's kind of got a lousy setup, the way that you download the songs, because you have to have the person on your friends list, or they have to be in the top 100, which right now isn't a problem, but once you get more than 100 people on there with edits, it's going to be hard to find people with edits, so I...
3586969	3592291	I think that might be... It wasn't maybe the brightest way to do it, but maybe it was the only way they could.
3592431	3592811	I don't know.
3593251	3594091	It's better than nothing.
3594131	3595952	It's better than nothing.
3596232	3597732	Or even later.
3597812	3603394	I mean, who's to say you couldn't, you know... Because they have, you know, where you can update your software and stuff.
3604934	3607295	I don't know if I'd ever see that happening with Ultramix 2.
3607335	3609496	I think they'll just do an Ultramix 3 and fix all those things.
3610016	3610456	So we'll see.
3612616	3614377	Well, some of it's better than no it, so...
3616567	3616747	Yeah.
3617227	3619028	All right.
3620069	3623791	Well, I'm going to go ahead and open up the Skype line if some folks want to comment on Ultramix 2.
3623971	3625232	You can go ahead and give us a call.
3625812	3634516	Just go over to www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on Interact With Us, and you can give our show a call and let us know your thoughts on Ultramix 2 if you picked it up.
3635297	3637338	Not the Japanese import games just yet.
3637378	3638699	We'll get to those in a little while.
3638759	3640860	I know some of you guys want to talk about Festival and the other stuff.
3641160	3642280	We will get to those a little later.
3642300	3644081	I just want to kind of talk about Ultramix 2 right now.
3645492	3647554	Favorite song so far in Ultramix 2.
3647634	3648494	What do you think, Loki?
3649255	3649875	Oh, man.
3655419	3658882	I love the Midi Head remix of In My Eyes.
3659502	3660143	That's my favorite.
3661184	3663105	Second favorite, Monkey Punk.
3664146	3671831	Which is funny because I remember somebody saying that Monkey Punk, somebody who heard these songs before we did, saying that Monkey Punk was not that great of a song.
3672132	3673092	It's actually pretty funny.
3673533	3674013	I enjoyed it.
3674358	3676360	I like it because it just feels like guitar freaks.
3679062	3680403	Arcadian, favorite song in the mix so far?
3681745	3684387	I haven't heard him enough to really give a favorite.
3685468	3691293	I like some of the new stuff, like the new sort of electronic type of stuff.
3691694	3693155	Yeah, a lot of the different drum stuff.
3694076	3696138	Anything that you've heard that you like so far?
3696638	3697679	Jamie, anything you've heard yet?
3699910	3702771	I haven't been overly displeased except for the Tengoku.
3703832	3705532	That was just crappy.
3708254	3723080	Jonas, anything you... Well, I didn't really hear much of the songs, but some of the stuff I would consider my favorites so far until I actually play the game would be like Jam On It or... The booty ones.
3723640	3724780	Or Burn For You.
3725181	3726161	Burn For You, yeah, that's a good one.
3726181	3728262	Yeah, those are my top two so far.
3729862	3739130	I would say my top three, Skulk, Love Skulk, Love Skulk, Wherever You Are by Lava, and Tough Enough by Vanilla Ninja.
3740411	3742633	Love that song, and the video is cheesy-rific.
3742873	3745215	Love Skulk, but hate the cut of Skulk.
3746255	3748157	You're kind of mad because they took out the vocals.
3748197	3752240	Horrible edit of Skulk, but other than that, it's alright.
3752260	3754242	Once you hear the original, you're just like, ugh.
3754941	3755301	You know what?
3755461	3762325	I don't know so much, because the part with the female vocals is my favorite part of the whole song, and that's in there, so I'm okay with the cut that they used.
3762705	3766727	I agree it's kind of sad that the male vocal couldn't be in there too, but I don't know how they could have cut it.
3766747	3772810	But they need to definitely make sure that this... Stick with a different drum for the next mix.
3773370	3774090	That's what I think.
3774310	3774691	Seriously.
3775011	3781694	Just establish yourselves with a different drum, because obviously it's bringing them a lot of, you know...
3783795	3793654	and it's just, you know, it's a very good deal, I think, because you're going to hear all these artists you've never heard before and you're going to kind of get these brand new artists coming out just because of this.
3794417	3795498	DarkTetsuya DarkTetsuya
3818055	3818755	Awesome video.
3819136	3824418	Love the gyrus full tilt video because it actually has screens from the old school gyrus and a lot of fun.
3825499	3825819	All right.
3826199	3830742	So anyway, I guess what we'll do is take a break.
3830762	3833043	Then we're going to come back and talk a little more about Ultramix 2.
3834423	3835644	Looks like folks are shy tonight.
3835684	3837165	Don't really want to talk to us on the Skype line.
3837185	3837665	That's fine.
3837725	3838205	See if we care.
3839806	3840326	That's just fine.
3840366	3841327	We'll sit here and talk for you.
3842205	3842566	Close Your Eyes
3865993	3870440	Close your eyes and let us fly, you and I
3872782	3898080	Together we can touch the sky I was walking down the street You came like the summer breeze Sweeping my breath away It doesn't happen every day You and I together in the sky Forever young, we can have a time of our lives
3903486	3904927	Thanks for watching!
3928652	3945201	Close your eyes and let us fly You and I, together we can touch the sky Close your eyes, close your eyes and let us fly You and I, together we can touch the sky
3961697	3963461	Thank you for watching!
3994742	3998263	Yes, Marty Gantz, go ahead, play me something new right now.
3998283	3998943	You're so smart.
3998963	4001884	Go ahead, play me something I haven't heard before.
4124043	4125725	Thank you for watching!
4189540	4195105	Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song, Orange Lounge Radio.
4196687	4204033	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 119 in progress.
4204654	4210099	And somebody in chat said that they wanted to call on the Skype line, so I'm going to go ahead and open up the Skype line back one more time, see if we get a call.
4211027	4217148	So you can go ahead and call in our skyline right now if you want, www.orangeauntradio.com and click on Interact With Us.
4218809	4223410	While we're waiting for that call, Loki has some exciting news he wants to share with you guys about something we've got set up for next week.
4223470	4224530	Oh wait, never mind, we're getting that call.
4224630	4225530	We'll get back to that in a little bit.
4226450	4227471	Hi, you're on Orange Haunt Radio.
4228511	4229031	Hey Rob.
4229331	4230131	Hey, who's this?
4230671	4231031	Jazz.
4231231	4232512	Hi Jazz, how are you?
4233192	4234032	I'm good, how are you?
4234252	4234732	Good!
4234812	4236172	So you've been playing a lot of Ultramix too?
4236933	4237353	Of course.
4237633	4238713	And what do you think so far?
4239730	4240590	I think it's awesome.
4240770	4241371	You think it's awesome?
4241411	4243331	Now, you're somebody... How long have you been playing DDR?
4244732	4243331	1999.
4245012	4248573	1999.
4245312	4248573	And would you... You're old school like us.
4248773	4255455	Would you like me... Now, you don't have to agree with me, but would you say, along with me, that this is the best home mix they've ever released?
4256236	4257076	Of course, yes.
4257096	4257996	Definitely.
4258656	4260537	What is it that makes this mix so damn beautiful?
4261929	4269291	It's because they took it in a whole new different direction and gave us Americans something that hasn't been rehashed from Japan a million times over.
4270111	4271352	It's the copy of a copy thing.
4272012	4272432	Exactly.
4272572	4273012	Exactly.
4273493	4277814	I'd say a different drum is the best thing that happened to Ultimix 2, honestly, my opinion.
4278174	4281315	And Xbox Live, because I love Xbox Live.
4281655	4285236	I never thought two, three years ago... How long ago did Xbox first come out?
4285276	4285976	Three years ago or so?
4286056	4289557	I never thought I would be sitting here saying I actually love an Xbox game, but it's true.
4289777	4290638	I have to eat my words.
4291338	4291498	Yep.
4292232	4293333	A lot of people are doing that.
4293594	4293854	I know.
4293894	4296016	So how's the competition going on Xbox Live?
4296056	4298278	Aren't you ranked like number three or four right now on there?
4299139	4300600	Something like that last time I checked.
4301175	4302416	It's pretty easy.
4302896	4303656	It's easy?
4305037	4308098	Like, the timing is really pathetic, actually.
4308258	4308558	Yeah?
4309338	4312219	I like triple A'd at least ten songs last night.
4312739	4313480	I'm so surprised.
4313580	4315741	I triple A'd ten songs.
4316781	4320122	Okay, on the 20 November special yesterday, I was playing on light mode.
4320342	4322823	Now shut up, because I was actually on dance pad.
4323243	4326145	I got one great on four songs in a row.
4326945	4327165	Nice.
4327185	4328385	I was so pissed off.
4330663	4333704	That happened to me a lot on Heavy, and I was really mad at that for a while.
4335945	4337926	Listen, you and your DDR skills.
4339427	4345110	Now, I don't know, any suggestions you would take to the Konami team for Ultramix 3 ideas?
4347931	4350912	A lot more 2DX crossovers, a lot more B-Mani crossovers.
4350972	4355574	I didn't even know that something like Midnight Special was so awesome until I actually got to play it.
4357015	4358736	Exactly, because that song was always in Guitar Freaks.
4359982	4363845	Is it just me, or does Sleepwalker sound like a total... Is that the name that's on Sleepwalker?
4363865	4365526	Does that sound like a total Guitar Freak song?
4366086	4366347	It does.
4366807	4369289	The Boy Zone, or whatever that other song was.
4369329	4370129	What was that other one?
4370649	4371330	Boy Jazz?
4371370	4372050	Boy Jazz.
4372431	4374312	No, Boy Zone is that Europe band, huh?
4375373	4376353	I think it's something else.
4376533	4377054	Euromix.
4377254	4377914	That's Euromix.
4378435	4378775	Yeah.
4379435	4379756	Alright.
4380976	4381797	Anything else you wanted to say?
4383223	4386666	Not really, except, come on people, practice, give me a challenge.
4387386	4391469	Oh, a call, a call to those on Xbox Live, challenge.
4391789	4393551	What's your gamer tag, so folks can find you?
4394251	4395372	KamikazeCat.
4395492	4397093	KamikazeCat, alright.
4397594	4398214	Whoop some ass.
4398515	4398835	Alright.
4399115	4399355	Alright.
4399515	4399976	Good luck to you.
4400616	4401317	Alright, you too.
4401397	4402057	Alright, later, bye.
4403538	4406841	Now what he doesn't know is, I plan to take him over in the rankings very soon.
4406861	4408282	Sigh.
4409221	4426266	Now, maybe it's just me, but I honestly think that this DDR mix is so good that we seriously need to start hounding, and I don't mean like just writing letters and, you know, saying pretty please.
4426306	4435429	I mean hounding Konami, everybody, from every angle, to let Konami of Hawaii do a new arcade mix and put a new arcade mix out there in America.
4437099	4438479	Anybody else feel similarly at all?
4438640	4441200	Or have you guys given up on DDR in the arcade?
4441360	4441661	I don't know.
4442261	4442781	Is it just me?
4443861	4446962	Not necessarily a having given up, just no expectation really.
4448563	4453524	That's kind of where I'm at right now, which is why it would be such a pleasant surprise to see a new arcade mix.
4454145	4461027	And I think that with all this great music they're getting in DDR now, and just the way it's been presented, and the way the steps were done and everything, I think...
4462017	4462477	Hostile Takeover!
4462497	4463618	We'll buy 51 shares of their stock!
4489414	4490314	That's a really good idea.
4490614	4491455	Yeah, we could do that.
4491495	4492295	Oh, my God.
4493155	4497076	And honestly, as shareholders, we would have interest in the company's activity.
4497176	4498196	That is a brilliant idea.
4499657	4502437	Is Konami a publicly traded company, though, because it's Japanese?
4502637	4503738	I do believe so, actually.
4504178	4505398	One second.
4505458	4507438	Oh, she's looking it up in the business law book.
4508039	4509099	That's a really good idea.
4511099	4513240	Oh, man, we should become Konami shareholders.
4516621	4517821	That's a great idea, Jamie.
4519099	4519379	All right.
4520580	4530004	All right, Jamie's going to look that up in the business law book over there on what's going on with the possibility of buying shares in Kami.
4530044	4530684	Any other methods?
4530704	4534906	Just check up, make sure, see what their corporate deal is.
4535106	4536407	Okay.
4536487	4538868	Any thoughts from you, Loki, about a new arcade mix?
4539148	4541849	Haven't you been saying for a long time they need to do a new arcade mix?
4542269	4543350	Now you're all of a sudden really quiet.
4544722	4545102	I'm Lovin' It!
4559856	4567422	Businesses have relationships with all sorts of people, other than their stockholders, including employees, suppliers, customers, creditors, and the local community.
4568222	4575307	Under the stakeholder interest theory of social responsibility, a corporation must consider the effects its actions will have on the other stakeholders.
4577737	4587921	So there may actually be a legal requirement to satisfy those who have a stake in their activity.
4588582	4591223	Not just their shareholders, but also their customers.
4593564	4594224	This is a great idea.
4594324	4596205	I'm seriously going to look into buying Konami stock.
4596385	4599226	You could just buy like 5-10 shares of stock on E-Trade, right?
4600233	4601053	There's also this one here.
4601453	4607815	For example, a corporation would violate the stakeholder interest theory if it viewed employees solely as a means of maximizing stockholder wealth.
4608576	4612457	So, basically, they have to treat their employees well, of course.
4613157	4626401	But also, that's just saying that anyone who has an interest in the activity of the company, you know, if they're not meeting the majority interest, then they're actually violating that rule.
4626843	4630626	So if you love Konami and you want to see them do right, put your money where your mouth is.
4630646	4631547	I think I have that right.
4631587	4632347	Buy a piece of them.
4633168	4634309	I think it's a brilliant idea.
4634609	4635950	I think that we should buy Konami stock.
4636531	4637091	I'm going to do it.
4637311	4638252	I'm going to look into it.
4638352	4638812	I don't know.
4638852	4640694	There's a business major in the chat room.
4640874	4641695	Can you answer this for me?
4643656	4645357	I know, maybe we're just talking out our asses here.
4645617	4647218	But in theory, it sounds like a good idea.
4647258	4647818	It really does.
4647878	4648278	I don't know.
4648919	4652860	I mean... Oh, Zaku found the financial info.
4652940	4653661	Oh, beautiful.
4654001	4654701	Thank you, Zaku.
4655101	4656642	He put a link in our chat room there over it.
4656662	4660024	I think I might have misinterpreted some of this, but let me look at this.
4660164	4665926	I mean, okay, granted, one person couldn't just buy two shares and then expect to run the company.
4666447	4666707	But if...
4667387	4671709	Several people bought several shares that collectively had a say.
4672409	4673349	They might listen to you.
4673630	4675030	Maybe we should incorporate ourselves.
4675750	4676291	Seriously.
4677791	4679692	Well, I think we need to do that anyway.
4680952	4685094	Yeah, but Orange Lawn Trading will not be a publicly traded company because nobody's going to tell us what to do.
4685474	4685954	Exactly.
4686775	4688795	We'll be privately owned.
4689336	4690616	What are our earnings for this year?
4692137	4692577	One dollar.
4695052	4704377	I'd like to thank my friend Julie who I'm on another form of chat that I'm not letting anybody know because I don't want them to send me messages all of a sudden.
4706178	4714923	The site, if you're ready, is konami.com slash en slash ir slash um wait
4717020	4718081	Another page popped up over it.
4718141	4719142	Let me get the address again.
4719802	4720083	Okay.
4720923	4728050	It's konami.com slash en slash ir slash stockholder info, all one word, slash index.html.
4730472	4732694	And it actually goes back to investor relations.
4733975	4736477	I posted that in our chat room if folks are curious about that one.
4736497	4737017	This is kind of cool.
4737197	4738258	This is very interesting.
4738278	4742562	This is a very interesting direction you've just kind of taken this program, Jamie.
4742602	4743243	Very interesting.
4745175	4749477	As of 19 November, KNM stock is $22.09 a share.
4749917	4751178	Not too shabby.
4751458	4752538	I could buy five shares of that.
4754699	4760922	Maybe we as, you know, find out how many shares are available.
4761762	4762062	I don't know.
4764730	4768772	I don't know the first thing about playing the stock market.
4768852	4775635	But as shareholders, though, we would have a right in our voice and how the company is run.
4775855	4776876	This is what it is for me.
4777476	4778477	I love this game.
4779077	4782399	My life has changed for the better in many ways because of this game.
4782419	4785300	And I know that kind of sounds, you know, maybe sad to some people.
4785340	4787861	But seriously, I've met a lot of great people because of this game.
4788361	4789042	I've, you know...
4790943	4796989	I've started, along with DarkSakura and Loki, a radio program which I love doing twice a week.
4797529	4798590	This game has done so much.
4798730	4799591	I believe in this game.
4799731	4800992	I want to see this game have a future.
4801052	4803815	I'm going to put my money where my mouth is and buy a piece of it.
4804155	4808259	One thing that I need to point out, too, who is this Primo Maggot, I guess?
4808519	4818243	You can only buy as many shares are available too for purchase because they are going to take certain interest to make sure that those takeover cases... One person doesn't do a hostile takeover.
4818403	4819464	Exactly, exactly.
4819504	4828808	They have ways of making sure that you're not... But at any rate, even if you own one share, you have basically an interest in how the company operates.
4829682	4833028	You have a right to say, I am not pleased with what you are doing.
4833088	4834230	You have to listen to me.
4836033	4840040	Not that I would say I'm not pleased with what they're doing, but I would say...
4840543	4846526	But overall, I mean in general, you know, I'm disappointed in what you're doing.
4847086	4860954	You know, it's just a matter of, you know, you now actually, as you have a full, you know, an interest in their activity, not just an interest as a consumer, but an interest as someone who is making money off of this company.
4861034	4866817	I think you've got a great idea on your hands, Jamie, and it is worth the hundred bucks for five shares to find out, honestly.
4867267	4886476	You know, if really, if you want to make your voice heard, you can write all the letters you want to until the cows come home, until they're run over by a Katamari, but if you actually go out, put the money down and say, I have interest in your company, this is what I would like to see, then this is a real definite way to make your voice heard.
4887857	4888297	Interesting.
4888417	4891078	This is going to be very interesting to see where this goes.
4891298	4894520	If anything becomes of this idea, I'm very curious to see what happens.
4894780	4895120	We'll see.
4895881	4896641	Loki, you have a comment?
4897986	4902690	Um... No, I was just thinking it'd be cool if they had DDR for the DS.
4903810	4904431	Second work.
4907153	4907553	Anyway.
4909654	4910015	Wow.
4910375	4910435	Or...
4912985	4914867	Now the chat room is running away with this idea.
4914927	4920172	Zaku says, I propose every DDR player in the country over the age of 18 buy at least one share of Konami stock.
4920813	4924656	Maybe pulling legs there, but if you could get a large amount of them too, you could.
4926018	4929041	And then Primo Maggot says, and then show up at Konami's shareholder meeting.
4929810	4930291	You know what?
4931612	4934996	I'm actually seriously considering doing it.
4935076	4935817	Look at this, Jamie.
4936157	4939261	Your school and now this are coming together.
4939341	4941103	You can apply this business law knowledge.
4941123	4941944	Your professor would be so proud.
4941964	4944527	Even though I changed my major and the class is no longer required.
4945188	4945608	That's alright.
4945868	4947390	You would still make your professor proud.
4947410	4949192	Do you want to send a copy of this program?
4949533	4950554	Or do we say fuck too much?
4954964	4956945	I think we say fuck a bit too much.
4956965	4964609	Would they allow me to come in wearing an eyepatch and a pirate bandana during the shareholders meeting?
4965029	4967650	I'm not going to do a hostile takeover.
4968330	4976254	Honestly, if you want to be taken seriously, if you want this idea to be taken seriously, no, you can't come to the shareholders meeting dressed like a pirate.
4981007	4983129	But I think Hell No, We Won't Go would be okay.
4983769	4984210	No, I don't know.
4984730	4985110	We'll see.
4987292	4987993	Very interesting.
4988253	4990335	Alright, well, to be continued.
4990415	4991015	I'm going to do something.
4991035	4991916	I play party games.
4991976	4994138	Come on, what were you thinking?
4995019	4998101	I've got a lot of time off work this week thanks to Thanksgiving.
4999322	5003125	I have a lot of time off during work thanks to my work.
5003866	5007029	So now it's on.
5007309	5009551	Julie suggested we insert bleep for fuck.
5011641	5013483	No way, I'm not going to bleeping censor myself.
5013943	5014243	Alright.
5014503	5015424	Bleep you, buddy.
5023070	5025452	Alright, let's change topics completely.
5025492	5027253	Something we haven't talked about a whole lot tonight.
5027634	5028294	Damn, it's a big deal.
5028674	5029775	Where are we going to be talking?
5029795	5030756	Oh yeah, okay, sorry, Loki.
5031917	5034759	We're going to do the Akira Yamaoka giveaway very soon.
5034819	5036881	But Loki, you have an announcement you want to talk about.
5037621	5040764	Anyways, as we were mentioning earlier about, you know...
5041584	5046826	How we were going to have Conception on the show and Conceptions out there with Waldo.
5049167	5054248	In the meantime, we were talking with another artist out there and I think we mentioned it on the other show.
5055009	5065372	Next week, on Orange Suns Radio, coming to you live, the guy behind one of the best remixes, I think, in this new Ultramix 2.
5065632	5066793	In any DDR, honestly.
5066813	5069714	And in any DDR, MidiHead will be on the show.
5070054	5070374	Woo!
5071334	5072955	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
5091850	5097714	He did actually one of the trailers for the Matrix Reloaded, I should say.
5097834	5100295	One of the songs that I entered in Cage Mansion.
5100315	5101075	Didn't win, but that's okay.
5101856	5104157	And just a bunch of other stuff.
5105138	5107819	I think there's some other games also, but I don't remember offhand.
5108380	5110921	But yeah, he will be on the show next week.
5111354	5111894	And this one will air!
5132488	5134670	For MidiHead, you can send them in.
5134730	5139432	We'll create a thread on our forums, or you can ask questions live during next week's show.
5139652	5142914	I can't eat this microphone, I found out.
5143335	5145656	Anyway, let's get to the other order of business tonight.
5161360	5169104	That's right, it is time for the very first drawing in the Akira Yamoka signed CD giveaway.
5169144	5172966	We've asked you questions Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday nights.
5173366	5180410	You guys have entered, and we're going to pull a name out of the hat right now and find ourselves a winner right now, live on air.
5181110	5184992	Don't worry guys, though, if you didn't win this week, you got a whole nother chance.
5185012	5188853	We're doing the whole thing, we're just rewinding and repeating, next week.
5189153	5193235	And you have a chance to win Monday night, Tuesday night, and Thursday night.
5193295	5195116	Monday night, Diversion, the Bomani Remix show.
5195136	5197437	Tuesday night, Pump Up the Volume, Randomness with DarkSakura.
5197457	5199858	And Thursday night, Outside the Box, gaming with myself.
5200498	5200978	And remember...
5203004	5203805	Listen all three nights.
5204246	5204927	You can enter three times.
5204947	5206509	You can enter three times if you listen all three nights.
5206529	5207491	You can enter chances.
5207511	5210295	And I realize one of those nights is Thanksgiving, but you know what?
5210335	5212639	If I'm going to be here and do a show, we're going to do a drawing, dammit.
5212999	5213300	Alright.
5213861	5215142	So, Jamie, you want to pick our winner?
5215782	5217243	Do I want to?
5217323	5217883	Sure!
5217943	5218843	Alright, she's going to pick her winner.
5218863	5222204	She's going to reach into the hat and pull out a... Ooh, it's the Dr. Dick hat.
5222284	5222965	I feel dirty.
5223065	5224525	Yes, it's the Dr. Dick hat.
5225225	5225766	Alright, hold on.
5225786	5227986	We're going to... I'm going to mix it up.
5229147	5230367	I want to caress the names.
5230807	5234329	You can caress the lovely names and then pull one out of the hat and we're going to see who wins.
5235529	5237210	Ooh.
5238350	5241231	Ooh.
5241591	5241751	Ah.
5242372	5242992	Pick one.
5247915	5248296	Jazz!
5249298	5250720	Jazz is the winner!
5250821	5254127	Congratulations!
5254147	5255910	He was the one that just called, too!
5257375	5257795	Yay!
5257835	5258356	Yay!
5287631	5287951	Alright.
5289912	5290972	Is he even listening still?
5291032	5291372	I don't know.
5291432	5294093	He probably went back to playing Ultramix 2, so he probably doesn't even know he won.
5295533	5296253	He's all, huh?
5298894	5299614	Yeah, he just went, huh?
5301075	5302435	He doesn't even know why he won.
5303495	5304976	Alright, well, he'll figure it out pretty soon.
5306296	5306916	He figured it out.
5306956	5308457	Oh, I guess the buffer, yeah.
5312958	5313958	Yes, Jazz, you won.
5316599	5316939	Anyways.
5317316	5329664	Alright, so he's going to win that signed Akira Yamaoka, what is this here, a mini-disc from Silent Hill 4, The Room, it's a Japanese CD, here, we'll put this on cam too, and it's signed by Akira Yamaoka.
5329964	5332986	Again, if you didn't win tonight, try again this week.
5333006	5336468	And he gets the special copy that I scraped with iron wool.
5338669	5340510	No, you did not, quit lying, quit lying.
5341051	5343332	But maybe we'll send Jazz some other orange launch prizes as well.
5343352	5344573	But those are speed grooves.
5347335	5347855	Oh, that'd be cool.
5348575	5350356	Jamie's going to try and scan it so we can get a picture in.
5350796	5352897	We'll do that with the other disc that we're going to give away this next week.
5353357	5355517	I can try and put this on cam, but I don't think it's going to turn out very well.
5355537	5355737	Let me try.
5355757	5357458	There's speed to make it play faster.
5363099	5365100	Jamie, you know what we've missed?
5365860	5366100	What?
5367601	5368061	The ferrets.
5369441	5370241	I'm sorry, listeners.
5371142	5371822	Give me the babies!
5374812	5375733	My parrots.
5375773	5376274	My parrots.
5378055	5379316	Hey, don't throw that at my paper.
5381558	5381938	Babies.
5384300	5385181	Is this the retard baby?
5386642	5387943	I think the retard baby is in the closet.
5387963	5388883	Hey, this is my laptop, okay?
5389184	5389484	Sorry.
5389804	5390665	The retard one doesn't work.
5390705	5391225	You can have it back.
5391305	5392166	I throw like a girl.
5392186	5392406	Sorry.
5392446	5394548	The retard one died of complications.
5395088	5395889	It died of crabs.
5395949	5397490	Oh, somebody stapled this one.
5397510	5399111	Somebody did an operation on this one.
5399132	5400893	That was mine because I had to.
5401073	5403495	Yeah, because the geniuses that made those parrots.
5403840	5404661	Thank you for watching!
5418150	5422633	We're going to go to a break, and when we come back, I want to talk a little bit about some of those other releases that came out tonight.
5422693	5428256	In fact, stuff that I know nothing about, so I'm going to try and call somebody over the Skype line to kind of talk about it a little bit.
5429156	5436000	But in the meantime, we're going to go to a break with some more music from Ultramix 2, DDR, and then the Cage Match as well.
5436460	5441243	I Spy is the first song we're going to hear in this break, as well as I'm in Heaven and Istanbul Cafe.
5441283	5441703	We'll be back.
5445715	5446156	Thank you.
5471963	5473224	Music Music Music
5502595	5503176	Thanks for watching!
5570565	5585372	Don't wanna be the one to tell you how I feel When these feelings I have really are for real The time is right for this, a love to shine on through But you gotta tell me what you wanna do
5602395	5603275	Thank you for watching!

5744958	5746459	Hey, did you hear about that show?
5746959	5747540	What show?
5747840	5753324	Well, they play a lot of great Fermanian video game music, but if you listen to it, you have to listen to it again within seven days.
5753724	5755005	Oh, I've heard of that station.
5755105	5755425	Really?
5755845	5757946	Yeah, I even listened to it a couple weeks ago.
5758427	5760708	Hey, what happens to you if you don't listen to it again?
5760908	5761869	Well, you die.
5762469	5763050	I, what?
5763850	5768033	Hey, wait, what's this crazy bitch doing coming out of my computer screen?
5768053	5769114	Ahhhh!
5770257	5771378	Orange Lounge Radio.
5771558	5772999	Listen or die!
5774339	5779202	We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
5779222	5781863	We just heard some more songs from DDR Ultramix 2.
5783064	5788607	Including I Spy, I'm in Heaven, and Istanbul Cafe.
5789848	5792329	He says he's contemplating giving it away as a Christmas gift.
5792469	5793189	Isn't that cute?
5793209	5794530	We'll see.
5797912	5799432	What?
5799612	5799852	What?
5827148	5830049	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5850239	5857483	All right, we are going to get to the cage match in a little bit, but first off, I want to talk a little bit about 2DX8Style, because that's a huge thing that's coming out, right?
5857543	5859284	Oh, it came out already in Japan.
5859805	5865228	It's exciting because it has some 2DX Red songs that are unlockable in it, including Spiral Galaxy is one of the songs.
5865888	5868070	And then there's these great new consumer songs.
5868110	5870891	I definitely want to play one of the new consumer songs for you.
5870931	5873613	But first, I thought maybe we'd give somebody a call.
5874073	5879495	that knows a little bit more about this stuff than I do because I haven't really been following the 8-Style News.
5879535	5881116	Jamie, have you been following the 8-Style News at all?
5882556	5883717	Kind of, sort of.
5883957	5885278	I honestly haven't had time.
5885438	5886398	Loki, have you at all?
5887759	5888259	A little bit.
5888599	5892801	Arcadian, I know you have a little bit, but... He's trying to find the mic.
5893921	5894441	Yeah, a little bit.
5894461	5897002	I read a little bit of stuff, but... Sounds exciting from what you hear?
5897583	5898163	Yeah, sounds pretty cool.
5898183	5898583	All right.
5899090	5902993	Let's see what our buddy DarkLionXVI has to say about 2DX.
5903033	5904694	We've talked to him about 2DX before.
5906115	5906415	Hello?
5907136	5907856	Hello, Sky.
5907956	5908917	Hi, is this Ziggy?
5909558	5909778	Yep.
5909978	5910758	Hey, how you doing?
5911499	5912099	Doing fine.
5912520	5912840	All right.
5914661	5916523	Where's your copy of 2DX8Style?
5916963	5919485	Well, it's already in the UPS office here in Vegas.
5919685	5921266	They won't deliver it until tomorrow.
5921526	5923688	Don't you just want to go break in and get it?
5924774	5925474	I don't think so.
5925754	5926455	Not a good idea.
5926475	5927495	He doesn't want to get busted.
5927935	5931256	So tell us about some of the things we have to look forward to in 2DX8 style.
5932216	5937138	The main menu's interface is like DDR Extreme US's Song Select Wheel.
5937918	5938338	Really?
5938818	5939098	Yeah.
5939998	5942679	Wait, it has the Song Select Wheel from EXUS?
5942739	5943019	What?
5943699	5943980	Yeah.
5944520	5944940	Wow.
5945360	5945860	That's crazy.
5945880	5946880	I didn't know about that one, huh?
5948121	5949461	Does it have iToy support, too?
5950581	5950921	No.
5951922	5952642	Okay, well, that's good.
5953755	5955837	What about some of the new unlocks, some of the new songs?
5956778	5960021	About the unlocks thing, Spiral Galaxy and Taiyou.
5961462	5965246	You can unlock them by playing all of the eight style songs, including the exclusives.
5965446	5966567	However, there's a catch.
5966848	5968789	Do not use easy.
5970131	5971892	Oh, what happens if you do use easy?
5971912	5972473	You're screwed?
5974275	5976757	You cannot be able to unlock it.
5977262	5987191	It has to be normal or hard mode.
5988072	5992276	Well, I haven't heard much, even Everyday Lovely Day or Nebula Grasper.
5992296	5993537	I'm going to try to get it tonight.
5993757	5997180	Well, we're going to play some of them actually here right after I'm done talking to you.
5999922	6002265	I absolutely love Everyday Lovely Days, so we're going to play that one.
6002285	6005589	We'll probably throw in Nebula Grass first as well, because I know that's one a lot of people are looking forward to.
6006390	6007952	LED looks like he's back.
6008012	6010274	There were rumors that he left, but he came back.
6010315	6011556	Do you know anything about that?
6012437	6015601	No, I haven't been browsing around Vermont-y style about that.
6016322	6016582	Huh.
6017923	6018344	Alright, well.
6019268	6023472	I was just curious, because a lot of people were saying that LED had left, and now all of a sudden he's got all these songs again.
6023552	6025814	So, if he did leave, he came back pretty quick.
6025874	6026895	I don't know what happened there.
6027355	6028516	And one more thing.
6028756	6028956	Yes.
6029297	6037984	About... On the record, it doesn't show the complete listings of your current scores, the progress.
6039045	6040286	Konami somehow removed that.
6040746	6041007	Huh.
6042228	6042728	That's weird.
6043329	6043729	Interesting.
6044269	6047292	Like, if you've beaten the song, or what?
6048143	6055469	No, just like shows your grades, just grades, grades, like the records of each individual sounds.
6055489	6057330	They might have taken that out.
6057730	6058891	Weird.
6058951	6061433	You're getting some feedback in the chat room there.
6061513	6064696	Jason says, what does he mean the EXUS song wheel?
6064756	6065837	What do you mean by that?
6065897	6067678	He said it's 8th style arcade authentic.
6069640	6070881	Let me try to find that picture.
6072993	6075155	I know it's in Bimani style.
6075355	6076796	He found a picture of it somewhere, okay.
6077376	6079317	Well, maybe, are you sure it's just not a Photoshop?
6079337	6080958	It's not a Photoshop.
6081138	6082920	It is a real deal.
6083140	6084881	Some of those kids over there love to Photoshop.
6086242	6087182	Alright, we'll see.
6087543	6089784	Alright, so Siggy's going to try and pull up that picture.
6090024	6091946	When you find that link, could you post it in the chat room there?
6091966	6092366	Yeah, I will.
6092386	6095668	For some folks that are really curious about what's going on there.
6097808	6100629	Oh, here's the thing about AI and SVGL.
6100929	6105171	As of last Wednesday, they have Beatmania 2DX11, 2DX Red on their machines.
6105431	6106071	Oh, very cool.
6106592	6109033	I want to go down to Arcade... You know what, Sad?
6109053	6115516	I'm going to be in LA tomorrow just for the day, but I'm not going to be able to go to Arcade Infinity.
6115836	6117357	So I'm not going to be able to check it out for a while.
6117417	6118577	But I do want to check the game out.
6118677	6118998	We'll see.
6120358	6120598	Alright.
6122039	6123220	Okay.
6123360	6125721	Anything else exciting about 2DX Red that you've heard about?
6125741	6125961	The new...
6127661	6139712	Oh, by the way, on 8th style, whether regular or limited edition, you will get a goalie cover of a 2DX Red e-amusement card featuring Daruma and Tsunaru.
6140192	6141093	Oh, cool.
6141193	6143375	One of those little cards you can put... Oh, that's very cool.
6143495	6143835	Alright.
6145137	6150782	Are we getting any... AI is working on their 2DX e-amusement readers.
6152163	6152363	Okay.
6154439	6160102	Is the EMU's thing, were there extra songs that were available on 2DX for the EMU's thing?
6161203	6166886	I never really got... Oh, they're probably from the network.
6167526	6168026	Oh, okay.
6170007	6177911	I was just curious, because I know Poppin' Music usually has the e-mall songs that end up in the consumer style releases, but not so much 2DX, so I was curious.
6179152	6181513	Anything else you want to share about what's going on in the 2DX world?
6182310	6182710	Oh, here it is.
6182770	6183671	I think I found the picture.
6183911	6184911	Oh, okay, found the picture.
6185171	6186491	I'm going to post it over.
6186892	6192594	Because our chat room is seriously going WTF because some folks have played it and said it's arcade authentic.
6193614	6198476	I had heard that the title screen was really weird, so maybe that has something to do with what's going on.
6198496	6199616	Here's the picture.
6199656	6200096	I've linked it.
6200536	6200796	Okay.
6200816	6203497	All right, I'll have to take a look here.
6204038	6205318	I've got to see this for myself here.
6210000	6234837	Oh, oh, interesting, the way it's, is kind of across the top, oh, okay, that's kind of like, okay, kind of like the title screen, I see what you're talking about, okay, that's, that's what it is, that funky new menu, like the main menu, where you choose, like, expert, beginner, how it kind of has that, yeah, this one's featured in, I think the one right here on the picture right now, it's featured, I mean, it's chosen as Danny Ninte, or Fast Course, right,
6235868	6236388	Very interesting.
6236408	6238890	Okay, I'd heard that the title screen was a little different there.
6238910	6239530	Okay, that makes sense.
6239550	6240270	Yeah, it's very different now.
6240330	6243632	So, but once you get in and you pick the songs, it looks like 8th style.
6244192	6244453	Mm-hmm.
6244473	6244973	Well, that's good.
6245073	6245433	That's good.
6245553	6246454	And no iToySupport.
6247154	6247894	Yeah, I know.
6249195	6249455	All right.
6249575	6255719	And there's also a high-speed setting where you individually choose a song on which high-speed you want.
6256119	6257019	I had heard about that.
6257139	6257920	That's so good.
6257940	6260981	Like, in the expert courses and stuff, you can do a separate high-speed for each song?
6261021	6261862	You can do that, too.
6262674	6270564	Oh, thank God, because that needed that, because I would hate having a non-stop course, and then, like, I would have, like, Dune, and then I'd have to do 250 BPM.
6270945	6271525	Sucks.
6271645	6272226	Expert mode.
6272727	6273007	Yeah.
6273888	6274269	Alright.
6274489	6274950	Very cool.
6275030	6276311	Anything else you want to share about 2DX?
6276351	6276752	What's going on?
6277973	6280615	Yeah, that's the only thing I can share.
6280635	6286080	When I do get my copy of 8th style, I'll give you pictures, even a clip of me playing dancer.
6286841	6287802	Oh, yes, my favorite song.
6287822	6288723	All right, definitely.
6288803	6291005	And we want to talk to you guys, talk to you a little bit more.
6291426	6294969	When I say you guys, I mean the listeners in general about your thoughts on 8th style when you get it.
6295029	6296150	And we'll give you our thoughts as well.
6296851	6297091	All right.
6297191	6297411	Yeah.
6297692	6297872	All right.
6297892	6299073	Well, thanks for letting us bug you, Siggy.
6299093	6299494	Have a good one.
6299994	6300274	All right.
6300354	6300575	All right.
6300615	6300795	Later.
6301806	6304148	All right, some information there on 2DX8style.
6304209	6309174	Scared everybody a little bit with that comparison to EXUSA, but it looks like it's just the menu.
6309354	6310015	Don't worry, kids.
6310275	6311556	Everything else is still just the same.
6311897	6312637	Don't freak out on me.
6313218	6316902	All right, speaking of 2DX8style, there's some great new consumer songs.
6317902	6321184	It's so nice to see the return of consumer songs in 2DX.
6321504	6324165	So we're going to play a couple of those for you guys right now.
6325225	6328726	My favorite song, Everyday Lovely Day, the LED style mix.
6328766	6329267	I love this song.
6329807	6331928	And Nebula Grasper, because that's a really popular one, too.
6331948	6335089	We're going to play those songs, and then we'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio.
6335129	6335529	We'll be back.
6577250	6578873	And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
6578893	6585745	That was a preview of some songs from 2DX8style, some new consumer tracks there, Everyday Lovely Day, and Nebula Grasper.
6587708	6588248	Very cool.
6588889	6594893	Anyway, we are back and also being released this week, DDR Festival and Poppin' Music 10.
6595513	6597615	Don't know a whole lot about Poppin' Music 10 yet.
6597695	6603959	I'm not up on the Poppin' Music scene, to be honest, but I'm going to try and get Navi back here on the show after he's gotten a chance to play the copy.
6604439	6607421	I did hear the Akumajo Dracula medleys in it, which makes me very happy.
6607502	6608442	That makes me go squee.
6608722	6608922	Yes.
6609463	6611925	I guess it's one of the email songs that's in there, so it's very awesome.
6612965	6619350	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6635681	6637243	I figure there's not too much of a point.
6637323	6645690	But for those people that don't have an Xbox, but they do have a JPS2, it's kind of a first chance for them to take a look at some new songs and also the new interface.
6645730	6646611	So, you know, pretty good.
6646991	6647972	Just pros and cons.
6648012	6650094	Just all depends on what you're looking for in a DDR mix.
6650934	6654638	I'll bet you anything, though, whatever they release next year will have some of the Ultramix 2 stuff in it.
6655338	6655739	We'll see.
6656699	6657300	I could be wrong.
6657560	6658241	Wouldn't be the first time.
6658261	6658601	We'll see.
6659282	6659542	All right.
6660478	6660598	TACO?
6660638	6660758	TACO?
6690433	6693338	Last week in the Orange Lounge Radio cage match.
6694679	6697220	I took a risk by putting in a top 40 song.
6697800	6698821	And what do you know, it worked.
6698981	6700142	You guys voted at the winner.
6700722	6702123	It was Gwen Stefani.
6702763	6705404	And the name of the song is What You Waitin' For.
6706144	6707225	And that was last week's winner.
6707285	6708886	Remember the way the cage match works?
6708926	6715409	You hear a clip of last week's winner and two brand new songs in their entirety as chosen by the Orange Lounge Radio hosts.
6715749	6717970	And then you vote on your favorite in our chat room.
6718010	6722192	And the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio Live.
6722679	6723701	Alright, so here we go.
6723761	6725924	Let's start it off with song number one tonight.
6725964	6728688	It's a clip of Gwen Stefani with Whatcha Waiting For.
6769275	6771597	Thank you for watching!
6799711	6813817	Watch now, you're still a super hot female You've got your million dollar contract And they're all waiting for your hot check Watch your wedding, watch your wedding, watch your wedding, watch your wedding
6830849	6833750	Alright, that was a clip of song number one in tonight's cage match.
6833770	6835350	Gwen Stefani, what you waiting for?
6835470	6836170	Last week's winner.
6836230	6840452	Song number two in tonight's cage match comes to us courtesy of DarkSakura.
6840852	6842492	DarkSakura, what did you pick out for us tonight?
6844112	6846613	I picked a song that was in Amplitude.
6846633	6847693	Okay.
6848954	6850894	I'm pretty sure we haven't done this one before.
6850914	6851794	I don't think so either.
6852174	6853915	I would remember a band name like Manchild.
6855002	6856483	Man Child Nitro Narcosis
6897125	6897868	Thanks for watching!
7037922	7038302	Oh yeah!
7128703	7130904	Alright, that was song number two in tonight's cage match.
7130924	7133565	That was Manchild with Nitro Narcosis.
7133605	7138167	Let's go around and see what everybody thought of that one, starting off with Jamie.
7138928	7140348	I thought that song was pretty cool.
7140448	7143650	It's actually fun to listen to when you're driving.
7144490	7149292	So it gives a 9 for the speed limit.
7149312	7150172	I was going 90.
7152393	7155835	Alright, let's go over to Arcadian42 and see what Arcadian thought.
7156667	7163294	I'll give it a 9, because it sounded pretty good.
7163634	7164575	Alright, 9 from Arcadian.
7164595	7164976	Jonas?
7167078	7167738	Well, I'll give it a 9.
7167778	7168539	It sounds pretty good.
7168619	7169961	It's got a good beat to it.
7170701	7172563	Alright, a 9 from Explicit as well.
7172703	7173244	And Loki?
7174443	7174903	I liked it.
7175184	7175664	I give it a 9.
7176925	7182870	Alright, then, uh, wow, everybody gave it a 9, but I'm sorry to break the trend, but I only thought it was kind of okay.
7183111	7185413	I mean, there's just songs in Amplitude I like better than that one.
7186394	7187014	I give it a 5.
7187114	7189356	We've already picked them for Cage Matches.
7190037	7192899	I know, sorry, I just, I didn't dig that one as much, sorry.
7193179	7193620	I give it a 5.
7194120	7196723	Alright, let's go on to song number 3 in tonight's Cage Match.
7196803	7199465	It comes to us from Loki, and Loki, what did you pick tonight?
7200998	7205642	I didn't really have anything, so I just picked a song that I just happened to have lying around.
7206463	7215130	This is another DM Ashura song, a remix between A and AA, so obviously this would be AAA.
7217152	7222496	Okay, here we go, and I love how you just let our listeners know that you're just not even trying anymore.
7223717	7227801	Well, I have another song that's decent that I could put in instead, but you already have that song, so...
7229841	7235037	All righty then, here it is, DJ Amuro remixed by DM Ishura with A.A.A.
7235298	7235578	Enjoy.
7309304	7310045	Thank you for watching!
7369284	7370146	Thanks for watching!
7436571	7438672	Alright, that was song number three in tonight's cage match.
7438752	7443533	DJ Amoro remixed by DM Asherah with Triple A. Jimmy!
7444914	7448855	It sounded like A to C. It wasn't bad, though, at all.
7452757	7459279	It's really hard to put my finger on it, because it's just something that...
7460911	7470716	I think it was, you know, when you hear that fast drum beat pick up to another part that like everybody in God uses, it sort of sounded like there's just recycled tricks in it.
7471216	7471996	But it wasn't bad.
7473177	7474537	So I'd have to give it a 7.5.
7474717	7476718	Alright, 7.5 from Jamie.
7476918	7477359	Arcadian?
7479379	7481220	Sounded pretty good.
7481480	7483181	I'd give it like 8.5.
7483361	7484102	8.5 from Arcadian.
7484142	7484522	Jonas?
7486283	7487543	Well, it sounds pretty good.
7487563	7489144	There are some flaws with it, like
7489482	7492703	There's like some recycled samples and sound effects.
7494604	7496445	And, well, I don't know.
7496465	7500747	It also sounds like some of the elements used in previous DM Assures work as well.
7501747	7502688	I respect DM Assures.
7503826	7508287	works a lot because he's done so much for remixing good remixes.
7509247	7512768	As opposed to Paranoia, Cowgirl, Survivor, Max.
7513368	7513588	Ew.
7514768	7521309	Or that 1, 2, 3, 4, Max, Honeycrap that we heard somebody play at the station.
7521869	7524990	And I have to say, it is not a Max remix.
7525590	7528030	For the love of God.
7529450	7531291	But yeah, I might actually do a pinfall for this.
7531371	7532191	So I'll just give it an 8.
7532990	7534572	All right, an eight from Jonas.
7534932	7535232	Loki.
7537034	7539717	I would pretend to be excited, but I'm not, so I don't care.
7540418	7541299	Whatever.
7542099	7544462	It gets a triple A because, yeah.
7545043	7545783	Whatever, I don't care.
7545903	7546104	Nine.
7548066	7552931	I'm sure that made a lot of fanboys and girls very moist in their nether regions, but I don't know.
7553891	7554812	It just didn't do it for me.
7554832	7556453	It didn't have the same charm of the original.
7556533	7557214	I mean, it was cool.
7557274	7557935	It wasn't bad.
7557995	7558615	Don't get me wrong.
7558996	7564060	So I was going to give it a 6, but Jonas brought up a very good point in the fact that it's not a max 300 mix.
7564381	7565702	And for that, I give it a bonus point.
7565742	7567083	So I give it a 7 overall.
7567524	7567884	All right.
7568364	7568845	But you know what?
7568885	7570046	It doesn't matter what we think.
7570086	7571027	It matters what you think.
7571087	7573189	So you guys can vote in our chat room.
7573229	7576792	Here are the three songs, one more time, that you can vote for tonight in tonight's cage match.
7577112	7578494	Gwen Stefani, what you waiting for?
7588139	7591501	And song number two tonight, Manchild with Nitro Narcosis.
7601888	7607172	And song number three tonight, DJ Amuro, remixed by DM Ashura with Triple A.
7617802	7621306	All right, guys, place vote now.
7621526	7632157	Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote, and your votes will be counted up, and we will reveal the winner shortly, as soon as we get all the votes.
7633198	7634139	All right, in the meantime...
7635914	7636134	DM Ashura
7649396	7654420	Step Mania's Urbanized theme, which is a little bit different than most of the other themes out there.
7654440	7656061	It's kind of a neat look to it.
7657082	7658643	There's dancing characters for you.
7658824	7660405	Oh, the dancing characters there are.
7661245	7666870	There's a skin edit of Emi and Halas Emi that...
7667370	7668291	Master Chief from Halo
7698444	7700726	Did they ever fix the Mr. Spanky dancing character?
7700746	7702968	I think I remember that there were issues with it or something.
7704029	7704609	Yeah, it fixed.
7706771	7709414	It was just a bad file or something.
7711015	7712156	But it works now.
7712616	7718542	Mr. Spanky can dance around like crazy.
7719382	7722325	Have there been any new skins for Step Mania recently?
7722425	7725628	I notice you still hoard that Technofield one, but has there been anything new?
7727903	7729063	Techno Fiend, whatever.
7741690	7743411	I don't know, some other ones that are being worked on.
7743851	7747674	They all kind of look the same, but the Urbanized one, Technofine are pretty good.
7749315	7755139	There's supposedly work on Euromix 2, but I mean, that's pretty much just Max 2, so what's the big deal?
7755960	7770209	Also, I forgot to mention, of course, you know, Festival, the new steps are being coded for that, and also for the new songs in Ultramix 2, and for the Dancing Sage Fusion stuff should be coming out eventually.
7772170	7778533	It's a little easier to do it from Xbox because they can actually rip the steps and code them directly.
7778693	7780434	So it makes it a little easier.
7782135	7786737	So look for those that hit DDRUK at some point relatively soon.
7787918	7790079	Other than that, really not too much else.
7790939	7795161	If you want to go find some good skins for Step Maniac, go to DDR Maniacs.
7795261	7796722	Go to their Step Maniac forum.
7797042	7798523	There's a whole section for themes.
7798923	7800807	and there's a ton that are being worked on right now.
7801307	7803651	And they even have a whole thread of ones that are finished.
7803851	7806135	And there's plenty for you to choose from.
7806175	7808860	So just go look over there and you'll find them.
7810803	7811524	Alright, sounds good.
7811544	7813167	You guys want to know who won tonight's cage match?
7814605	7815165	Yeah!
7815365	7816926	Alright, it was very close.
7817086	7819647	It was won by one vote.
7820208	7822809	And then the other song, it beat it by two votes.
7822889	7824730	So it was all very, very neck and neck tonight.
7825230	7827891	Tonight's winner, I think this is actually a bit of a surprise to me.
7827931	7832653	Tonight's winner is... Gwen Stefani!
7834554	7837196	For the second week in a row, if you can imagine that.
7838116	7839817	Oh, Loki says it's on.
7840857	7842178	It's gone next week, trust me.
7843038	7844660	I want four weeks in a row, man.
7844680	7846883	I want Gwen Stefani to get retired, man.
7847264	7847825	She's awesome.
7849046	7849527	All right.
7849867	7850949	By one vote.
7852351	7852851	So close.
7853392	7854133	Every vote counts.
7854173	7854674	What can I say?
7855495	7857878	We could have had a tie and somebody could have broken the tie, but no.
7858239	7859260	One vote decided it all.
7860606	7862927	Oh, of course, everybody in chatroom is bitching about it.
7863007	7863767	Oh, hell no.
7864267	7865348	Don't tell me that song won.
7865808	7867928	Hey, you guys voted for it.
7867968	7869089	I'm counting the votes right here.
7869809	7874291	I think the people that voted for it are kind of hiding now because they see that the wrath is coming to get them.
7875031	7875311	All right.
7875571	7876771	They want to know what came in second.
7877352	7882233	It was AAA by one vote, and then the other song was down by two votes.
7882593	7884854	But all pretty much across the board.
7885294	7886234	All pretty much across the board.
7887135	7887415	All right.
7888575	7891797	So we will see what happens next week in the Orange Lounge Cage Match.
7891817	7895159	But for now, let's get back to Ultra Mix 2 songs, shall we?
7895179	7897461	I think we can all agree that Ultra Mix 2 songs are pretty good.
7897821	7900123	And in this break, we're going to hear... Ooh, my favorite one's in this break.
7900163	7901223	One of my favorites.
7901283	7902904	Toe Jam is in this break.
7903284	7904065	This song's great.
7904145	7905466	It's like a country song.
7905866	7909949	And then Tough Enough by Vanilla Ninja we'll hear in this break, too, as well as Wherever You Are by Lava.
7910269	7915332	And for those of you that play doubles, I hear the doubles light steps have a certain way you're supposed to play them.
7915638	7918099	I don't know what that means, but that's what I've been told.
7918239	7919300	It means hoedown!
7919580	7920140	Square dance!
7921101	7921381	Alright.
7921901	7922381	Here we go.
7922522	7923702	We will be right back after this.
7945813	7947675	Music Music Music Music
7996429	7997970	Thanks for watching!
8028705	8031247	Baby, I'll be the strongest to survive
8060067	8061015	S, Actdeft
8065846	8066987	and the rest of the cast.
8097350	8122596	I don't need you there, cause I need you there, all tonight Just keep on keeping the promise, if you don't come, don't be around, away, go for the fire, baby, that's tough enough Just keep on living strong, stop giving me doubt, don't be free, just get you in the deep of the heartbreak, baby, that's tough enough
8135397	8136789	Baby, I've had enough
8266984	8269145	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
8269185	8271267	Hope you're enjoying the Ultra Mix 2 songs we've been playing so far.
8271287	8272408	What did you guys think of Toe Jam?
8274190	8276391	Yee-haw, Ninja Cowboy.
8276952	8278974	Which is funny because it was followed up by Vanilla Ninja.
8279134	8279394	Uh-huh.
8280250	8281130	What did you think of ToeJam?
8281230	8284592	You guys explicit in our Acadian?
8289253	8291894	It's country gone techno.
8293355	8294135	What did you say, Loki?
8295076	8295756	Where's Earl?
8296536	8297157	Yuck, yuck, yuck.
8297957	8298317	You know what?
8298377	8300838	I had a ToeJam and Earl song in the pre-show.
8302054	8302434	I heard that.
8302914	8307699	You know, El Mullet made this funny realization in our chat room before the show, during the pre-show.
8307719	8315106	He was talking about the song Toe Jam and he said, it's funny because there's a pun in there because, you know, you're jamming on your toes to the steps.
8315326	8316287	Get it?
8316307	8316367	Huh?
8318269	8318529	Funny.
8319630	8320110	Funny stuff.
8321011	8322353	Everybody's a comedian these days.
8322987	8324168	Because we're sick and not going to take it.
8360602	8367044	I would like to offer a big F you to the Lexus van freshly purchased that was driving in front of me.
8367584	8374507	Doing not the normal one to two car space that you're supposed to have, but doing like five car lengths.
8375473	8377455	Thank you for watching!
8390538	8392078	My angst knows no bounds.
8393439	8396279	And I don't have words to properly express it.
8397160	8399740	So, uh, oh yeah, F you to this fucking paper!
8400420	8401161	I hate you!
8401801	8402861	Focus on ethics?
8403281	8403921	What are those?
8405402	8406682	Um, but that's really about it.
8406782	8415844	I'm just sort of angsted out, so I'm gonna pass on the mic and release my anger in a more physical method by beating up, you know, an inanimate object.
8415904	8417765	Probably a fact machine office face style.
8418405	8418705	Awesome.
8419369	8421310	I just need the gangsta rap replay in the background, you know?
8422710	8428553	Remember, if you guys want to send in a nephew, send a private message to Sky in our chatroom right now while we move on to Loki.
8431854	8435255	Fuck you to trees and the leaves that they drop.
8435635	8437516	My God, there is literally like...
8438942	8440664	A couple feet of leaves outside.
8440884	8445248	We walk out there to my car, and there's literally a pile of leaves next to my car.
8445648	8448571	I swear, if I leave my car there for a few more days, it's just going to be covered in leaves.
8449591	8453855	But, it's fun to kick them and make lots of noise late at night.
8453955	8457238	It's kind of funny, when I came here yesterday, there wasn't any leaves on the ground, really.
8457318	8459180	And then I came in, and they were just all over the place.
8459340	8460321	Yeah, they all fell at once.
8462521	8464243	So that fucking sucks.
8464523	8477774	Also, fuck you G4TV because you suck and your stupid attempt at doing something clever the Nintendo DS day was fucking lame, okay?
8478295	8486842	I don't like watching TV in a small little screen on my TV showing the show and what looks like a DS around the show and some stupid chatting
8487210	8488992	Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.
8505811	8513414	Anyway, um, and finally, um, fuck you that my money isn't on my card yet.
8513514	8517595	That pisses me off because I want to go spending, spending, spending, spending.
8518275	8527978	And, uh, fuck you using my GameShark for breaking, especially after I spent like an hour putting all the codes in and playing with it a few days, and then all of a sudden it just stopped working.
8529119	8530219	Thank you, Interact.
8531067	8531327	Old Face Jeff
8562048	8562909	No, they get worse.
8563809	8565010	F you to getting stood up.
8565530	8566330	That is awful.
8566571	8567811	Why do you do that to people?
8568291	8569212	That is rude.
8569632	8570673	It's so rude.
8571833	8572934	God damn you.
8574395	8574755	That's alright.
8575115	8575956	I forgive, though.
8576096	8576776	I forgave.
8577216	8578137	I'm such a sucker.
8578677	8579398	No, that's alright.
8579798	8580718	I try to understand.
8580738	8582219	I just have angst.
8582579	8583340	Yes, Loki.
8584781	8588322	You know, maybe watching a nice episode of I Killed Your Cat would help.
8589883	8590184	Shut up.
8590644	8590964	No, didn't...
8592842	8594103	On a happier note, my paper's done.
8604921	8610983	Also an F you to the fact that I have to wake up at 4 in the morning to catch a flight to LA so I can do one day's worth of work in LA.
8611363	8623228	I'm training a whopping four people tomorrow and they're sending me all the way down there costing them I don't know how much money and the fact is I will be working from about 6 o'clock in the morning till 7 or 8 at night.
8623308	8624809	That's because corporations are retarded.
8626409	8628210	But they give me lots of money so it's okay.
8631032	8634233	And, um, F you to mail PMS, because I swear we have it.
8634693	8635313	And it's pretty bad.
8637574	8642615	Alright, let's move on and see what some of our other folks in the room have to say, starting with Arcadian42.
8642655	8653118	Alright, uh, fuck you to the, the ticket, parking ticket machine in the courthouse for eating my dollar and not giving me a ticket.
8653138	8656118	Parking tickets, I had to go and park and go get the walk-up thing.
8656639	8658219	I lost a dollar to that damn shit.
8659229	8661890	Uh, fuck you to my foot for hurting.
8662650	8664650	It's hurting for a little while.
8665550	8670131	Uh, fuck you to my... Parts of it are oily and greasy and yucky.
8670592	8672012	I have to wash it off all the time.
8672032	8673732	And then other parts are fucking dry.
8675093	8677033	Damn winter does weird things to me.
8677253	8681534	Uh, and... Yeah, and...
8683177	8696208	FU to having too many tests for one whole week, even though I passed it all, it took me like, only giving me three hours of sleep the whole time.
8696428	8701032	FU from working a 12 hour shift, starting from 7 o'clock in the morning,
8709779	8713681	F you for having a 12 hour shift on a Friday working at 7 o'clock p.m.
8713721	8730049	till like 7 in the morning and then later on going to the barrier right after you're only giving me like 30 minutes of sleep oh wow yeah but then later on I have to sleep in the party F you for not getting WWE safety cables autographed out on Saturday
8731092	8734275	A friend of mine was supposed to go, but he couldn't go because his license got stolen.
8734355	8736076	Is Stacy Q the one that sang Two of Hearts?
8737537	8738038	Rad!
8738998	8742942	Yeah, she's the one with the good ass.
8744423	8750047	And here's one big F you to the NBA on Friday.
8750448	8752389	My God, the Pacers and the Pistons.
8753190	8759095	Why the hell are you going to go fight over something just over a game just because someone dunked over your ass?
8761184	8771352	And as for our test, why the fuck did you punch the wrong fan who you thought threw a bunch of cup of ice on you?
8772133	8774595	That was the wrong person, you sucked a white man.
8777137	8779939	Instead of some lady who was behind you, you actually threw it against you.
8782041	8783562	Yeah, my gosh.
8784423	8786985	Oh yeah, that also resolves.
8788075	8794438	F you to the fans at the NBA, at that Detroit game, who are also causing the fight in the first place.
8795039	8797080	Man, why can't we all get along?
8799561	8800201	Seriously.
8800281	8800801	Preach on.
8802882	8804743	Dang, and people fighting over things.
8804963	8807084	I think a few people got hospitalized over the fight.
8808165	8809686	And people get suspended indefinitely.
8810746	8812027	Don't come around blaming on...
8813586	8817108	Ooh, it's the NBA's fault, or ooh, it's the Detroit Pistons' fault.
8817408	8818929	It's everybody's fault in the first place.
8821250	8821890	Seriously.
8822931	8828193	People need to grow up, use their own common sense not to do some shit like that ever again.
8830234	8836758	Well, I think, yeah, I think, well, so far they're suspended indefinitely, but most likely they're going to be suspended for the whole season.
8838298	8839399	But who knows, I don't give a shit.
8842746	8847871	And F you to trees for putting a goddamn tree branch under my car.
8849192	8858420	I have to remove that by ripping the whole branch itself from the bottom.
8860362	8866147	Yeah, he's talking about more car problems and shit.
8866167	8869450	And F you to more SUVs fucking up the road again.
8870745	8891218	But this time I'm having a loose tire in the fucking freeway Almost causing another accident As if I have not gone through any more car problems recently Causing me to spend hundreds of dollars off my own damn paycheck And reporting it as an insurance will cost me a damn record There's also another F.E.
8891238	8894320	to my insurance God
8894838	8900703	The stress is too high, I'm broke as hell, I'm going to school, how the hell am I going to spend food money?
8902624	8906747	Or spend money on my DS, which now I owe money to.
8910110	8912432	You know, Explicit, you remind me of a...
8913739	8918062	80 year old guy who's sitting out on the front lawn drunk as fuck yelling at himself.
8920243	8923585	He's going, F this, and F this.
8924125	8925326	Why can't we all get along?
8925566	8926766	It's the damn kids.
8927067	8928487	It's all the damn kids fault.
8928507	8929328	It's just fine.
8929468	8932209	I'm just teasing you.
8934511	8939814	And F you for not being able to connect two Xboxes for the Halo 2 game.
8940774	8942275	Figuring out that there's a broken wire.
8943410	8945590	Well, oh well, maybe next week.
8947111	8948371	Alright, can I get to chat room now?
8948751	8949491	To be continued.
8949671	8950691	Alright, as always.
8950791	8951491	Alright, here we go.
8952252	8953692	Moving on to the chat room FUs.
8954952	8955832	Ooh, didn't we just hear this?
8955892	8957212	I think it would be a good FU music, though.
8958653	8963794	MPQ says, a big FU to Washington State for not having any 2DX machines.
8966614	8970055	Poto says, FU to greedy repo men who steal your Xbox.
8970195	8972075	No Halo 2 or Ultramix 2 for me.
8974688	8998978	DJ Ranma S, DS, says, F you to the dumb customers at Best Buy, I know how to fix computers, thank you, ask me one more stupid question, I'll replace your fucking Pentium 4 chip with a potato, oh yeah, F you to cock-teasing girls, you fucking suck, expect a flaming bag of shit on your front door, hey, that's one way to win the chicks over, Jamie, Jamie, chicks dig flaming bags of shit, right?
9002276	9004498	I love it when you're not paying attention to this show.
9006380	9007581	Like a yeast infection.
9013147	9013847	Yeast is good.
9013947	9014808	Yeast is in bread.
9014848	9015489	I like bread.
9015789	9016430	What's wrong there?
9017654	9019735	It's not candida yeast.
9020195	9025897	Yeast in bread is different than yeast in your vagina, okay?
9025937	9032980	Do you know what happens when you get a candida yeast buildup in your organs, like your stomach and your intestines?
9033260	9034381	It makes you die.
9034401	9043484	Yeah, it turns your stomach and your intestines into bread, and then you die, because they can't digest.
9043564	9044225	There you go.
9045345	9046165	Ferments them.
9046266	9047106	Oh my lord.
9048632	9050733	We've hit a whole new low tonight, ladies and gentlemen.
9051153	9055495	Misty says, F me for falling asleep and missing part of the Ultramix 2 show.
9055695	9056455	Aw, it's okay.
9057756	9068780	Legend of Zaku says, F you to the fact that DDR Ultramix 2 got the better songs and DDR Extreme USA owners get in the shaft by Konami for favoring Microsoft with a dollar sign over Sony.
9069320	9072481	F you to my braces for being retightened, thus making my teeth hurt.
9073081	9077003	And F you to the fact that I have two hard-to-sell exams tomorrow, both of which I'm not truly prepared for.
9078142	9105559	FU to the Pacers, Ron Artest for punching the wrong fan and FU to the Pistons, Ben Wallace for pushing Artest in the first place Artest got what he deserves and enjoy promoting that rap album now that you can't play this season Dark Knight says my FUs to going work especially on Friday the 25th aka Black Friday because I know that I'm going to be getting these a-hole customers that always seem to give me a total hard time nothing more
9108973	9111636	Sigurd says, F you to the lackluster DS launch.
9111676	9112377	Hey, but you had G4.
9112417	9113919	Just kidding.
9114279	9115541	Where the hell is my WarioWare?
9116302	9117723	That isn't Field of Magic.
9118544	9123089	F you to homeless people because they were chasing me in my dream before turning into Orange Lounge Radio.
9123170	9123430	What?
9125733	9126193	Great.
9127174	9127675	Damn them.
9130550	9134131	F you to DrawnTogether this past week for only being mildly funny.
9134371	9135651	I agree, it was only mildly funny.
9135931	9138892	More Xander and Foxy and Ling Ling and less everyone else.
9139812	9147974	Final F you to people complaining about it taking too long to get G2 unlocked.
9148074	9150615	I unlocked it in under a minute, so what's the problem?
9153135	9155596	You know something they don't, you little jerk.
9155676	9156756	You know it damn well.
9158271	9165458	Alright, DarkPetsuya, I'm going to have to agree with Loki, F you to G4 and the stupidest publicity stunt ever.
9167480	9174607	DarkLionXVI says, only one F you tonight, F you to my router for suddenly disconnecting me.
9177850	9178250	That's it.
9180052	9182414	Thank you very much for playing everybody in our chatroom.
9183007	9185148	Alright, let's do some more Ultramix.
9185168	9189311	We're starting to run out of show time, so I definitely want to get some more Ultramix 2 songs in before the show's over.
9189951	9192353	And maybe we'll do some Ask Orange Lounge when we come back.
9192413	9193454	Ooh, doesn't that sound like fun?
9193514	9194654	I know you kids love that segment.
9194974	9198577	So in this break, Rubberneckin', the Elvis song.
9198597	9203220	We're going to hear that along with a rock song called Sleepwalker and Tittle Tattle.
9203600	9204881	We'll be back after this.
9205161	9208523	And remember, Ask Orange Lounge is coming up, so send us some questions in our chat room right now.
9337853	9338853	Thanks for watching!
9359225	9376369	By the way, by the way, I'm not okay By the way, by the way, I'm not okay By the way, by the way, I'm not okay To be awake is the only thing I want With you, I'm just walking in my sleep To be awake is the only thing I want
9385058	9386201	Thank you for watching!
9436153	9462085	TonePone Dreams, Alpha Perfection, So Very Hard To Reach Harmony Machine, Tormenting The Sensory Deliciously Evolved, And Yet Nobody Knows Tittle Tattle, Chit And Chat, Shoots In The Breeze, Platter, Clack, Neat And Splatter, There's A Synchronicity
9479062	9481227	Thank you for watching!
9496204	9497144	Gaming Radio.
9497164	9497984	So uncensored.
9527225	9531709	and even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.
9531889	9533250	Orange Lounge Radio.
9539876	9543940	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio and having a little too much fun with PictoChat, actually.
9545701	9553227	I found a way that you could pull down the last image that was drawn or scroll up so you can erase things and change things in the image.
9553968	9554749	It makes a fun game.
9556349	9558210	The DS never knew that they had in there.
9560052	9560612	And you know what else?
9561773	9565676	This is why the N-Gage never worked, because it didn't have PictoChat, honestly.
9566297	9570360	Imagine if you could have PictoChat and send those little pictograms anywhere in the USA.
9570941	9572082	Even to random phone numbers.
9573763	9574404	That'd be the best.
9576565	9577766	What does this cock?
9579348	9581269	What does this cock on the cell phone?
9582731	9584212	Why you call me a cock?
9584312	9585292	I am no rooster.
9587814	9588114	Love it.
9591175	9593096	Alright, let's get to some Ask Orange Lounge.
9593116	9596178	Remember, if you guys have a question, send it in over private message right now.
9596238	9600080	Also, we'll open up the Skype line in a little bit if you guys want to call in and you have a comment or something.
9600120	9600880	I don't know, but here we go.
9608184	9609405	Let's Ask Orange Lounge.
9609986	9633002	some stupid question what will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio all I really know is that it's a really good thing that you guys can't see our picto chats cause then you'd think we're perverts as if you didn't already know extra verse tonight alright uh Flair O'Day
9634740	9641204	Hey, isn't it a bit strange that they put a good chunk of the unlocks for Ultramix 2 on the V-Rare?
9641444	9641785	And you know what?
9641805	9645887	Come to think of it, a good half of the extreme V-Rare songs are unlocks too.
9646508	9647188	What's up with that?
9648029	9648589	I kind of agree.
9648609	9652732	It kind of took a little bit of the thrill out of the unlocks, the fact that they were all already on the V-Rare.
9652792	9656774	But at the same time, it was some of the best stuff on the mix, so I don't know.
9656834	9662258	I would have liked to have seen more of the different drum songs, but I just thought the V-Rare was great because it had Skulk and Superstar.
9662278	9662898	I thought that was neat.
9664254	9666836	Any other comments, thoughts on the Ultimix 2 VRare?
9667777	9668777	It was pretty good.
9669378	9669918	I liked it.
9670639	9673121	It was just weird that they put so many unlocks on it.
9673561	9675642	You pretty much knew 9 of the unlocks, or was it 9 or 10?
9675922	9676223	I don't know.
9676663	9677043	A lot.
9677143	9681406	A whole lot of the unlocks just by picking yourself up a copy of the VRare.
9681426	9685990	Which, by the way, I'm trying to snag us some extra copies so that we can give them away on the show.
9686977	9696099	So even after the Kiryamaoka giveaway is done, we'll do hopefully another giveaway, some Ultramix 2 VRares, maybe for much easier things, just like calling in at a certain time or something.
9696119	9696499	We'll see.
9696599	9696879	We'll see.
9697079	9697360	I don't know.
9698920	9700180	Alright, moving on.
9700240	9702361	Let's see what Dark Knight has to say.
9702441	9702741	Okay.
9703281	9706102	If a tree falls in the woods, does it make a sound?
9706802	9707322	No, just kidding.
9707362	9712603	The real question is, how much of a lifespan will the DS have before Nintendo decides to make a new handheld?
9714564	9715044	Any thoughts on this?
9715064	9715264	Loki.
9715990	9718161	But I do half-hell deeming another color.
9721360	9722981	Seriously, I give it February.
9723101	9724923	We'll have new DS colors, honestly.
9725023	9745758	And then there will be some kind of Super DS or like DS Extreme or something where you're going to have to re-buy the DS because they did the same damn thing with the Game Boy when they did the little... They're going to do DS NES colors and DS Famicom colors and... I mean, they had Game Boy and then they had Game Boy Pocket.
9746038	9747279	Then they had Game Boy Color.
9747359	9750162	Then they had all the fucking colored Game Boy colors.
9751262	9753544	I'm not going to be as much crap as the PSP will be.
9774285	9775947	Siegert in our chatroom says, People!
9776588	9781073	There are no color combinations that will work besides the silver and black.
9781413	9782654	I have thought about this for hours.
9785638	9786038	Get a life.
9788721	9789542	Yeah, the QS.
9789562	9790443	Quad screen.
9790483	9791464	Quad screen.
9793191	9797054	Let's see how many screens we can cram into this thing.
9797134	9797554	I don't know.
9798635	9805580	To be honest, I think the next thing you're going to hear about DS is going to be a Bluetooth network where you can actually play online internet games.
9806420	9808041	And it'll be a peripheral, though.
9808982	9809682	It's coming out.
9810003	9811264	Warp Pipe is working on it.
9811784	9814406	They're not saying that's what they're working on, but that's what they're working on.
9815226	9818809	So you'll see that at E3 this year, though, because they're going to be at E3 this year.
9820470	9821871	But not until then.
9824015	9824135	DJ Doe
9828615	9831336	How did you get the music from Ultramix on the Orange Lounge Radio?
9831376	9835038	The reason I'm asking is because I like to make a music CD out of the songs from Ultramix.
9836098	9836738	Very carefully.
9836818	9838879	No, we rip them ourselves, actually.
9838899	9841160	We have the soundboard hooked up through the Xbox.
9841180	9842281	That's how we got tonight's songs.
9842641	9847383	And I know they're not like 100% perfect quality, so honestly, you may not want to burn them to CD.
9848223	9852605	But honestly, just keep looking around there on some of the different forums out there on the net.
9852805	9854085	Something will turn up soon enough.
9854325	9854826	Always does.
9855146	9855786	Any advice, Loki?
9856326	9858287	DDRUK, once the sim files are out.
9858996	9863139	Why are DDR Extreme USA owners getting the shaft now that Ultramix 2 came out and got the better of the songs?
9879750	9884273	I think they just tried to do something different with Extreme, with the whole eye toy thing.
9884313	9890157	I mean, you could argue, well, you know, Xbox doesn't have hands and feet mode, and I know that makes a lot of you guys go, big fucking deal.
9890737	9896321	But, they tried to do something different with the PlayStation, just like they were doing different things with Ultramix 2.
9896401	9900824	So I don't want to knock the PlayStation 2 for at least trying something different that wasn't there before.
9900844	9904426	And it wasn't just the eye toy things, but, you know, some new interface, new songs, things like that.
9905607	9906348	It just, you know...
9907268	9907388	Buy.
9907428	9907608	Purchase.
9937028	9939733	Thank you for watching!
9952138	9956120	And then, how many crappy songs can you find in Extreme USA versus how many can you find in Ultramix 2?
9956200	9957101	Well, I don't know.
9957161	9960483	I mean, I believe, if I'm not mistaking, it's kind of... I don't know.
9961323	9966265	Everybody thinks they know, but I think Japan, for the most part, did Extreme.
9966706	9972689	And Hawaii, well, we know Hawaii pretty much, for the most part, did Ultramix 2 with some help from their staff in the Bay.
9973609	9974750	So, I don't know.
9975270	9976051	I don't know, anyway.
9977611	9978152	It's just different.
9978172	9980653	They tried something different, and for some folks it didn't work.
9981690	9982751	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
10012523	10013564	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
10029993	10033415	For the most part, people are taking very well to the new music, and hopefully it'll continue.
10034216	10043542	MPQ wants to know, which is better, paying $400 for a Japanese PlayStation 2, 2DX and controller, or driving 14 hours to Ventura, California to play 2DX?
10045163	10048305	I've done both, sadly enough, although my drive was only 8 hours.
10049325	10049625	But...
10051317	10051797	I don't know.
10056380	10056780	You know what?
10056921	10063685	Even when you get it at home, it doesn't quite compare to the arcade, especially because the consumer releases are a little bit behind the arcade releases.
10064145	10070309	So honestly, I wish I could tell you one or the other was better, but face it, you're going to end up doing both, just like I did.
10071970	10073731	It's like masturbation and sex.
10077762	10091892	D.D.Arcoholic says, Hi Rob, Jamie, and Matt.
10091932	10092253	Hi.
10093333	10096075	I just thought of a super idea and wondered what you thought.
10096976	10102320	Would you do an all night Orange Lounge Radio Marathon live show like on a Saturday night?
10102360	10103901	You could do it for charity even.
10105125	10105725	That'd be fun.
10106285	10106565	Yes.
10106865	10108366	It'd be like a slumber party with vodka.
10108846	10110166	Yes, with one condition.
10110946	10112587	I want an arcade to host it.
10113427	10116367	If we're going to do it overnight, I'm not going to do it in this little apartment.
10116427	10118268	I want arcade games and things to do.
10118728	10125529	So if we could get an arcade in the Sacramento area to agree to it, and I think if we work the charity angle, yes, I'm all down for it.
10125789	10126269	Absolutely.
10126689	10127409	I think it could be fun.
10127569	10130750	Or maybe we could talk to our buddy at the theater.
10131684	10132124	Possibly.
10132164	10132985	That might be an idea.
10133165	10134325	On the big screen.
10134565	10134885	Uh-huh.
10135286	10135806	That's an idea.
10136166	10137246	We'll have to think about that one.
10138007	10141128	Can you imagine if we could get PictoChat on that giant screen?
10141668	10143009	That would be so cool.
10144610	10144870	Sorry.
10145910	10147351	The Orange Lounge lock-in.
10147511	10148411	I like the idea.
10148611	10151073	I like the charity angle, especially with Christmas coming up.
10151093	10152033	The Asylum.
10152053	10152233	What?
10152433	10153093	The Asylum.
10153133	10154274	We lock you in.
10155319	10155679	Great.
10156079	10158281	Yeah, I'm like, the Asylum is a dance club.
10158321	10158961	Don't get it confused.
10161183	10162323	I really do like that idea.
10162583	10166986	And in fact, I want to get in touch with you later about that, DDArcoholic, because maybe you can help me approach some arcades about it.
10167747	10169128	See if anybody would be willing to do it.
10169148	10170348	I think it would be fun.
10170648	10174331	If not, we could just always bring our shit to Country Club Lanes, because they're open 24 hours anyway.
10175311	10176172	But I'm all down for it.
10176192	10176792	I think it would be fun.
10178573	10178813	Alright.
10180174	10183136	Misty says, What do you guys want for Christmas?
10183356	10184277	Oh, I'm so glad she's asking.
10184955	10185235	Money.
10185615	10187056	Lots of it.
10187717	10189518	And some spinach.
10192099	10194961	I want sex.
10197322	10198283	But not from Santa.
10198303	10203686	Santa's got years of experience.
10203726	10204226	That's alright.
10205326	10207508	Santa would be quite the sugar daddy if you think about it.
10208028	10209789	I want someone to pay for my plane ticket home.
10210509	10211910	Thanks for watching!
10227606	10229669	And I know some friends of mine are going to host them, so that's cool.
10229709	10230210	It works out.
10230610	10232393	I'm not really big on material things.
10232733	10235617	Pretty much like if I want something bad enough, I just go and get it.
10236358	10240744	Honestly, I think the best gifts I've gotten in the past were like things that people made.
10240824	10243889	Like one year, Shark Scroll made me this collage for my birthday.
10244269	10245290	Look at you a sugar mama.
10279217	10294268	DJ Ranma S, DS says, My question, will you and the rest of Orange Lounge Radio be suicidal enough to go shopping on Black Friday, which is, of course, the day after Thanksgiving, biggest shopping day of the year?
10294368	10295528	Any plans to go shopping?
10295569	10295829	Jamie?
10297670	10299051	Um, yeah, actually, I am.
10299371	10300572	But you're going to be in Alabama then, right?
10300992	10302674	But yeah, I'm still going to be doing some shopping.
10302694	10303254	Still pretty crazy.
10303294	10304535	Actually, no, that's that Friday.
10304575	10305636	I'm actually going to be in Dothan.
10307230	10310412	Oh my god, that's where my boss is from.
10311373	10311933	That's so funny.
10313394	10314355	I'll go bomb them for you.
10315536	10316517	No, not my boss's house.
10316537	10317157	What Loki said.
10317197	10317858	I love my boss.
10318498	10318778	Alright.
10320059	10320479	Interesting.
10320900	10323762	As far as shopping, no, I don't plan on going to the mall that day.
10323822	10326043	There's nothing that exciting about it for me.
10326143	10327605	I'm going to stay home and masturbate all day.
10327705	10328105	No, I'm kidding.
10328145	10330266	I don't know what I'm going to do.
10330447	10331367	I may make it out.
10331527	10333349	If I have stuff to buy, I don't know.
10333369	10335150	I have to think of what I want to buy.
10335791	10338514	Depends if I have my money by then, which I hopefully will.
10338995	10341277	So, yeah.
10342959	10346082	I just want to sleep and play Final Fantasy and Ultramix, too.
10346142	10346863	Is that so wrong?
10346983	10348164	I mean, I don't want to go shopping.
10348625	10349546	I want to stay home.
10350707	10352089	Maybe get Mongolian barbecue.
10352109	10353470	Mmm, Mongolian.
10355632	10360177	Legend of Zaku says, so what do you think might be on your Thanksgiving Day table, a.k.a.
10360297	10362439	unique side dishes out of the norm?
10363580	10365923	Jamie, what do you think might be a unique dish on your table?
10367224	10367624	Haggis.
10367644	10371629	Is that for real?
10372149	10372630	Yeah, for real.
10373390	10374451	I have no idea.
10376874	10378816	We don't really have many out of the ordinary things.
10380433	10385576	I don't really know who's going to be cooking Thanksgiving dinner when I'm there, so I'm just going to say, put food in front of me.
10385876	10386636	I'm off the diet today.
10386716	10387036	Feed me.
10388397	10390958	And remember, don't eat in DDR.
10391599	10397102	Oh, but I should take a minute to plug the special that our buddies over on DDR Freak Radio are doing on Thanksgiving.
10397122	10402825	They're doing like an all-day marathon of DDR, like back-to-back, like non-stop till your brain explodes.
10402865	10404385	Seriously, it's going to be cool.
10404425	10404726	Like what?
10405106	10407467	Second mix, third mix, fourth mix, all of it back-to-back.
10407487	10408467	What time are they starting over there?
10408487	10409148	Nine, ten o'clock?
10409790	10437164	I don't know, check ddrfreak.com Go to ddrfreak, yeah Yeah, I mean, like you don't go there anyway But, you know, I just wanted to get that plug out there Don't forget Alright, let's see Moving on Oh, my dish at my table I don't eat turkey, I hate turkey So Thanksgiving's a really shitty holiday for me But my mom says she will be cooking ham And I like ham And she actually says she might just be ready to say fuck it And order a pizza, which I've been telling her to do for years So we might do that That would rock Deep fried turkey
10438308	10440869	Seriously, it doesn't take too long to clean because they're really yummy.
10440989	10441529	I don't like turkey.
10443911	10446872	DarkTetsuya said, have any of you picked up Metal Gear Solid 3 yet?
10447052	10448413	If so, what do you think so far?
10448473	10454775	Well, DarkTetsuya, if you were listening on Thursday, you would know that we got Metal Gear Solid 3, but haven't really played it yet.
10455016	10456676	We've got it, and we haven't played it yet.
10457457	10457677	Huh?
10457797	10461138	We've got it, and we haven't played it yet because they've been playing Halo.
10461799	10464640	Sadly enough, I've been playing more Rumble Roses than Metal Gear Solid 3.
10466041	10469102	Rumble Roses is every cheesy thing you would want it to be.
10470302	10474543	It is so horrifically bad in a great way.
10476704	10477404	Last question.
10479524	10483726	Oh, not really a question, but a comment from DDArchaholic says, Sounds good.
10484146	10485366	I'll make calls and stuff.
10486394	10487035	Good, good deal.
10487815	10491819	Maybe we'll open up the Skype line for like one quick call if anybody wants to get in there.
10491859	10492139	I don't know.
10492159	10494001	We'll open it up and see if anybody wants to call.
10494741	10496943	A lot of good questions.
10497784	10501247	Next week on the show, don't forget that MidiHead is going to be interviewed.
10501287	10502868	That's something we're really looking forward to.
10502928	10504029	It's going to be good to talk to him.
10504350	10506812	I want to know if he's remixed anything else.
10506832	10507512	That's what I want to know.
10507873	10509874	Because that In My Eyes remix is damn good.
10510295	10511516	So I want to know if there's anything else there.
10511923	10514845	You can visit his site over at midihead.com, of course.
10515425	10518928	And hopefully we get more people in the future as well.
10519068	10520088	Alright, Siggy's calling back.
10520108	10521349	I think he has a question or comment.
10521369	10522090	Hey, Siggy, what's up?
10522730	10523190	Hey, what's up?
10523210	10526593	I've forgotten one more thing you mentioned about 2DX8 style.
10526853	10527133	Do it.
10527813	10530495	Yeah, it's an option called Random Plus.
10532216	10533417	Random Plus, and what does that do?
10534138	10540742	Oh, it's the same thing as Random, only you do it... Scratch is included in it.
10541866	10542527	Interesting.
10543327	10543567	Huh.
10544368	10556037	Yeah, and the way you access Random Plus is hold the key wherever the random is for at least a few seconds, and the random will turn red.
10557238	10557558	Huh.
10558139	10558399	Okay.
10558459	10560821	And that's how you access Random Plus.
10561241	10565785	Yeah, supposedly you have to do something before that, but they'll do that, but I don't know.
10566513	10567634	So maybe it's an unlock, we'll see.
10567914	10570436	Alright, I'm going to go and take another call real fast, Siggy, but thanks for calling.
10570816	10571056	Alright.
10571136	10571517	Have a good one.
10572157	10574358	Alright, let's take another... Oh, damn it, just missed it.
10575139	10578021	That was you that just called... Oh, maybe I hung up on him.
10579582	10582564	Call back, person that just tried to call, because I think I hung up on him.
10582624	10583005	There we go.
10583865	10584966	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
10585786	10586947	Hi, it's MPQ.
10587047	10588428	Hello, MPQ, what's on your mind?
10589649	10593632	I was just wondering if I have any right to complain about 2DX when I have...
10594289	10596451	A poppin' music machine within driving distance.
10597052	10598994	Um, I don't know, what do you guys think?
10599014	10601036	Does he have a right to complain about two things?
10601236	10602717	What mix of poppin' music is it?
10603358	10603718	Five.
10604739	10606060	Well, see, now five's kinda old.
10606281	10607262	I mean, it's good, but it's old.
10607822	10608883	Yeah, you can complain.
10609384	10613588	I'd say you still have a right to complain, but not as much as the rest of us, okay?
10613608	10614008	Okay.
10614529	10614929	Alright.
10615009	10615329	Alright.
10616130	10616591	Have a good one.
10617732	10617972	Bye.
10618573	10618833	Bye.
10619978	10621139	Alright, we gotta wrap up the show.
10621239	10627144	Sorry to keep these calls quick, but we do need to wrap things up, and that means we gotta go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
10627625	10628606	Arcadian, your final thought.
10631088	10632529	Ooh, yay, Horde weekend coming up.
10634030	10634551	I hear that.
10636973	10638934	Uh, Explicit, your final thought.
10641597	10642678	Ooh, Thanksgiving.
10644399	10645300	Good turkey.
10646221	10646361	Uh...
10649010	10650091	Uh, Loki, your final thought.
10653533	10654914	I know there's codes out there.
10655014	10660578	I've seen them before for Grand Theft Auto San Andreas where you can modify the damage that each gun does.
10661058	10664180	And I can't find them for the life of me, and that pisses me off.
10665961	10671225	That and, um... Yeah, I need to buy some more games for the DST.
10673590	10678335	My final thought is... I don't want to get up and fly tomorrow.
10678415	10678896	It sucks.
10679717	10682420	And you know, I left my email with all my travel information at work.
10683461	10684762	But I know what flight I'm on and everything.
10684782	10685743	So hopefully I don't have a problem.
10685863	10686504	Or else I'm screwed.
10686764	10687085	We'll see.
10687425	10688126	Jamie, your final thought.
10689227	10691329	My final thought is... God damn you people.
10691450	10693572	Sign up for stuff and give me my iPod.
10694617	10696498	Oh God, you didn't get suckered into that too, did you?
10696558	10699940	Well, no, it's just because it's an experiment, so I want help.
10700280	10700520	Okay.
10700540	10701381	You'll help me, won't you, Rob?
10701501	10701641	No.
10702682	10703922	I don't buy into that shit.
10704503	10705643	I'm going to get my mom to sign up.
10706884	10707384	Have fun.
10707765	10712387	But no, it's more of an, I don't really care, it's just more of an experiment just to see.
10713108	10717030	Because I found that if you do the blockbuster thing, you can cancel it before they charge you with anything.
10717250	10718070	Yeah, yeah, you can.
10718491	10718871	So, uh.
10719802	10721364	I decided it's fun.
10721504	10722244	It's a distraction.
10722865	10723425	So why not?
10723766	10724066	Why not?
10724566	10726308	I just don't want spam.
10726328	10728189	So looking forward to going to Alabama.
10728209	10729411	This one doesn't give you any spam mail.
10731092	10731432	We'll see.
10731452	10732853	So I'm looking forward to going to Alabama.
10733134	10734275	Getting the hell out of this state.
10735656	10736416	Oh, gee, thank you.
10737017	10737638	We'll miss you too.
10737658	10738899	I'm not meaning the people.
10738959	10741501	I'm meaning the other people that don't exist in my universe.
10741843	10742304	That's fine.
10744286	10745086	I guess that's it.
10745467	10748169	Tune in next week for more fun on the show.
10748330	10752153	And hopefully, what I'm kind of hoping is that maybe we can get Karaoke Revolution 3 next week.
10752214	10755096	Because you know when Jamie leaves, Matt has to sing.
10756278	10756978	It's tradition.
10757659	10757879	PICTOCHAT
10784145	10789027	That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

10802853	10806815	And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.
10818112	10842468	Lacey Pings, the wife is missing Didn't ask for her permission I'm wearing her clothes, her silk pantyhose Walking round in women's underwear In the store, there's a teddy With little straps, like spaghetti
10843997	10862610	It holds me so tight, like handcuffs at night Walkin' round in women's underwear In the office there's a guy named Melvin He pretends that I am Murphy Brown He'll say, are you ready?
10862630	10868574	We'll say, whoa man Let's wait until the wife is out of town Later on
10870995	10873657	Thank you for watching!
10892550	10895413	Thank you for watching!
10920777	10924300	Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
10949588	10951389	Jamie, why the Christmas songs already?
10952270	10959094	Because I figured if our major department stores can do it and Walgreens can, so can I. Oh my god, are they playing Christmas songs at Walgreens already?
10960095	10961736	It's got the Christmas stuff up.
10962903	10970906	I went to Walmart the other day because we went to buy a silly headgear and stuff.
10971606	10972286	A headgear?
10972706	10972906	Huh?
10973487	10975667	We bought Care Bears party hats this year.
10976808	10979829	But they already had a whole Christmas section open.
10980789	10981729	It was kind of stupid.
10984610	10984910	Oh well.
10986071	10988731	And to answer the question in the chatroom, yes, that was from the Bob and Tom show, right?
10989972	10990492	Yes, indeed.
10991823	10995645	Ryachan says, it's funny to go into Walmart and walk around in the women's section looking for stuff.
10995705	10998966	My mom and my dad just start singing, walk around in women's underwear.
10999826	11000086	Get it?
11000106	11001147	Because you're in the department.
11005589	11006209	I thought it was funny.
11007209	11007790	It is funny.
11011171	11014312	So when do you go on your great adventure, DarkSakura?
11015313	11017353	I'm flying out Wednesday at 2.45.
11017434	11018654	Who wants to drive me to the airport?
11020135	11020935	I would, but I'm working.
11022970	11024539	I'm still trying to find a way to the airport.
11025271	11025731	Oh, shoot.
11025791	11027992	Well, you could always do a shuttle?
11028112	11028512	I don't know.
11029213	11030133	I'm working it out, don't worry.
11030333	11030893	Okay, that's good.
11032074	11038437	Alright, I guess we'll just kind of keep it a short afterbirth tonight then, since a lot of you guys don't have anything else to say.
11039217	11046220	But, I know we didn't get to a lot of those Ultramix 2 MP3s, so I'm going to put in the rest right now so you guys can hear it.
11046880	11050322	Because I bet you guys, some of you guys were waiting to hear some of the rest of those songs.
11050822	11051962	So we will get to those right now.
11051982	11053503	We're going to start it with Jam On It.
11054216	11062858	and La Cucaracha, Life is a Game, Looking for You, Mellow, Monkey Punk, Play My Game, and Red Room.
11063158	11065139	All those songs you're going to hear right now.
11066979	11068820	It's a block of Ultramix 2 music.
11068860	11069380	Enjoy, you guys.
11072600	11073421	I have to set it up here.
11073461	11073701	Sorry.
11074521	11075281	Here we go.
11075361	11075921	Now we can do it.
11081463	11082243	Can't hear me.
11090607	11117988	I jam on it, I jam on it, jam on and on and on and on it And if you're feeling like you wanna dance on that then go on ahead and float it Cause jamming on is what we do best, it's what separates us from the rest And if you don't think who's there for real, let me tell you what happened to the man at sea Say Superman had come to town to see who he could rock He blew away every crew he faced until he reached our block
11119109	11122471	It's because we're three stories high, but one was made of steel.
11123031	11126573	And when we brought our dead outside, he said, I'm so real.
