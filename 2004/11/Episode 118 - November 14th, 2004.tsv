83269	84910	Well, isn't that special?
89464	107974	Orange Lounge Radio Live is a fully interactive program via our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com And now, here are your hosts for Orange Lounge Radio Live, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
109995	111675	We are live!
111856	114757	And this is episode number 118 for this podcast.
116769	118330	I hate my allergies and want them to die.
139875	140316	Fair enough.
141159	148058	Also joining us tonight, the other awesome co-hosts we have here are Techmaster Loki, I'm Rowling.
150345	163731	Yes, if you want to know why our webcam isn't up yet and why we don't have the DarkSakura in our chatroom yet over at OrangeHunter.com, that's because we're having an emergency Katamari Damacy marathon.
164251	166272	Maybe Jamie will tell us about why we have to do that in a little bit.
166292	167892	But I do want to introduce our other guests for tonight.
167912	171014	We have a very special guest joining us for the second week in a row.
171034	171974	A lovely surprise.
172014	172814	He's in town tonight.
172854	173755	Say hello to Floatwalk.
174835	175856	Personal record for me.
176276	177377	That's right, two in a row.
178037	180598	If you made it next week, you'd have tic-tac-toe.
181179	183280	Wow, and three is a magic number.
183660	184220	It sure is.
184820	188482	Alright, so, Jamie, really fast before we go to the opening break here.
189323	192965	Why is Loki having to play Katamari Damacy right now?
192985	193505	It's so big!
196163	205446	Oh, um, because I can only get up to, as any, I've only done the level twice, 256 meters on the Make the Moon level.
205866	208227	And he's got this up to 744.
208267	209007	This is awesome.
209427	209767	Wow.
209947	210647	It's so big.
212568	215289	Yeah, so that's the only time Lokis are going to hear that in his life.
215429	215789	That's right.
217512	222118	All right, we're going to wrap up Katamari Dimash and put on the webcam and all that stuff.
222138	225742	So visit OrangeLoungeRadio.com, our website, for all the webcam details and stuff.
226122	229266	Tonight we have a lot of special stuff for you during the music break.
229727	232770	The Ultramix 2 website went up earlier this week.
232791	235073	We're going to be talking about that in a little while, but because of that...
235794	237715	We got a lot of spoiled songs.
237815	239695	Yay, spoilers, my favorite.
240035	243016	Wow, just take the fun away from us Vivids while we still have them.
244236	249397	You know what, you guys quit like three weeks ago, so as far as I'm concerned, you're done.
249437	250278	We're done with you.
250918	251358	No, I'm kidding.
251398	251998	I see how it is.
252198	253118	No, we're kidding.
253598	255379	We definitely want to get the gossip from you later.
256414	269543	But as long as we have the songs, because we have a whole lot of songs, we just, we went out there on the internet and everywhere we looked, we lifted up tables and dusted under them and we looked everywhere for as many of these songs as we could find for you guys to play.
269563	271385	So we're going to play them for you tonight.
271445	273746	We couldn't find everything, but we found a lot.
273766	275788	So we're going to play them for you, starting with this.
276604	279486	It's a brand new licensed song from Ultramix 2.
280746	286649	The artist is Lava, kind of like the soap, but with an extra A. And the song is called Wherever You Are.
287210	290711	And actually, this is not the first time we've played this on Orange Lounge Radio.
291212	291572	Really?
291652	294013	Yeah, I'm going to talk about why when we come back after this.
294073	294633	So enjoy this.
294653	296975	This is Lava with Wherever You Are from Ultramix 2.
385604	387059	Thank you for watching!
422158	436803	How I miss you so much I feel love in your eyes And I feel love when I'm with you I feel love in your eyes Wherever you may be
519406	520387	Gaming Radio.
520607	525591	So uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.
527493	529414	Orange Lounge Radio.
532517	534679	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
536340	538122	Turn off that Katamari game already.
539883	541685	That's so last month.
542827	543667	Get into now!
544468	545348	No, I know, I'm kidding.
545829	552072	But you... Now, apparently, Floatwalk was impressed because Loki knew about a hidden game during the credits.
553452	554913	Tell us about what's going on there.
554933	557194	Because I, unfortunately, did not really get into Katamari.
557214	560116	I got to, like, the second stage, and then suddenly got sucked into the other game.
560136	566839	Well, apparently, at the end, like, you see the credits roll, and you have a song, and you see, like, you know, your little guy running around with the ball.
567179	568700	You can actually move the analog sticks around.
568720	570201	You can pick up countries.
571405	597414	and so like you see like a list of countries like you know you see I picked up Korea picked up you know Vietnam all stuff I'm sitting here thinking wow I haven't seen so many like of those country names since like Animaniacs when uh what was it Yakko did United States, Canada, Mexico, Panama, Haiti, Jamaica, Peru you know I just wanted you to sing that song on air because that made me giggle during the break all right uh well good so we we we made the moon for Jamie good
598519	603123	Now she can't say that we don't do things for her on this show because we make the moon for her.
603243	604925	We gave her the moon, the stars, and the sky.
604945	605685	We swear.
605725	606306	That's right.
610730	611130	Failed.
611290	611931	Boo!
613492	614233	I had to go there.
614453	616154	If that was a thread, I would lock it.
618576	618917	Alright.
619597	619677	Um...
621926	624710	Jamie's in the potty right now, so we can't do how was your week, how was your day.
624770	630639	Oh, she's on her way out, but I'll take a minute to do some announcements.
631260	633162	By the way, folks, this is very interesting.
633202	638050	Here in the Orange Lounge Radio studio, the bathroom door, the lock is broken.
638476	640037	I was wondering what the hell was up with that.
640238	644721	At any time, somebody could barge in there while you're trying to tinkle, so please be careful.
645462	646183	Here's the rule.
646523	650827	If the light is on and the fan is running, don't come a-knockin'.
652188	652588	Alright.
653909	655511	I couldn't come up with a rhyme for that, sorry.
659154	660215	I think your mic ain't on there.
660795	661135	Try it again.
661316	664579	If the fan is running, you better start running because you never know what they're doing in there.
664819	665319	Exactly.
665600	666220	Something like that.
666500	666721	Anyway.
667541	668802	Oh yeah, relevant announcements.
669543	675268	Did you hear, maybe we've mentioned it a couple times, that we're going to be doing a really big giveaway here on Orange Lounge Radio.
675349	680253	And I'm not talking about, you know, no small time little, you know, yada yada giveaway.
680273	682015	We're talking really big news here.
683024	698239	We are giving away, in conjunction with DDRspot.com, that's kind of why Floatwalk's here tonight, because he's a big part of the DDRspot community, Orange Launch Radio, in conjunction with DDRspot.com, is giving away signed Akira Yamoka CDs.
698719	699180	Very cool.
699200	702483	We're going to be giving away two of them, so the contest is going to go for two weeks.
702543	703344	Now, here's the thing, though.
703704	706947	We changed the rules a little bit from what we talked about last week.
706967	707448	Because we can.
708228	710110	Yeah, because we can't, basically, is what it boils down to.
710470	716494	Now, and I know you love it when you hear that we changed the rules, but no, actually we did it to make the contest easier for you.
716954	717635	So here's the deal.
719621	721483	Forget what I said previously about how it's going to work.
721643	732313	How it's going to work now is that you know we have spin-off shows here on Orange Lounge Radio every Monday night, Diversion, the Orange Lounge Radio remix show, every Tuesday night, Pump Up the Volume with DarkSakura, and every Thursday night, Outside the Box with yours truly.
733655	736637	All of which are on at 7, although Pump Up the Volume technically starts at 7.30.
737078	744205	You've got to listen to those spin-off shows, and during the show at any time, we're going to ask a trivia question about Akira Yamaoka,
744825	749610	or it could be about something Akira Yamaoka was involved with, such as Silent Hill series would be a great one.
750031	751052	We're going to ask a trivia question.
751232	759141	If you know the answer to the trivia question, send an email to akira at orangeloungeradio.com and you will be entered into the contest.
759441	760202	That's the change.
760282	762704	You don't have to listen all three nights to be entered.
763345	773447	But what the change does allow us to do is that if you do listen all three nights and you send us three emails with the three different answers, you'll be entered in the contest three times.
773787	777488	So you have three times the chance of somebody else if you listen all week long.
778108	783249	But if you just, you know what, if you have a busy schedule and you can only listen one night, you can still get one entry into the contest.
783729	786070	So the contest starts tomorrow.
787350	794834	On the 15th, and it's going to run through the 20... It looks like the last entry chance will be on the 25th, Thanksgiving.
795254	795995	How appropriate.
796475	799997	Thanksgiving Day will be your last chance to enter, so look for that.
801952	804874	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
825351	831136	I'm going to tell you, I'm going to tell you, as soon as we finish this segment here with How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day, some folks already know.
831576	836200	Some folks have already figured it out, but we will tell you officially what's going on in a minute.
837781	844186	As I said, we've got to start off every week's show with a little bit of How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day, and of course, the lovely Dark Sakura starting us off, as always.
844906	847028	My week was insanely busy.
847748	849550	Just school, everything.
850631	853973	And then today, my allergies have been killing me all day.
853993	854814	It's been...
855575	865102	I'm trying to not get sick and everyone's getting sick around me, but I'm hoping that by running away to Alabama in another week, I'll be escaping the whole thing.
869646	871688	But apart from that, I really didn't do a whole bunch of anything.
876872	877552	Dot, dot, dot.
878093	878313	Okay.
879179	884840	As really, it's really been nothing but school and hanging out and just the same old crap I normally do.
885920	895422	So, now as for Rob's week, first he went on an expedition to Alaska where the Eskimos kidnapped him and made him their king.
895442	897323	Stop telling lies while I'm out of the room.
898143	899563	Although that did happen, actually.
899583	901224	It was three weeks ago, not last week.
901284	901744	Oh, my bad.
901764	902264	Yeah, your bad.
903024	903384	Oh, anyway.
903824	904085	Sorry.
904565	906205	I had to check on my laundry.
906225	910607	Because when Jamie comes over, she likes to not only do orange laundry.
910807	912788	This is how we pay Jamie for doing the show.
912828	916950	Since we don't have money to exactly give out to people, we pay in laundry.
917830	918550	In clean laundry.
918570	919511	That way I don't have to use our...
920922	922763	Hey, that's worth a lot of quarters for the arcade.
925485	925785	Alright.
925845	928767	And I'll pay you back in sinus goo.
929367	929767	Hooray.
930808	931729	Just what I always wanted.
932209	933630	Alright, so that's it?
935171	936271	My week was boring.
936912	937592	What's up with that?
937812	939954	The past two weeks you've been boring.
940654	941595	The past two weeks.
941615	944076	Well, I train people too.
944096	944857	That's my job.
945237	947999	Yeah, but I'm going to be going to Alabama though next week.
948659	949900	You're not going to be here for next week's show?
950876	955898	Well, I will be here Sunday, but that's Wednesday, the 24th.
956098	956539	I'm leaving.
956939	958059	Leaving on a plane.
958419	960700	Leaving on a jet plane.
961481	961821	Moving on.
962461	966303	Actually, next Sunday is going to be an interesting show because I have to get up at 4 in the morning on that Monday.
966323	967023	I'm going to L.A.
967043	972265	for a day for work, so I didn't even think I'd be able to do this show, but it does look like I will be able to do this show.
972786	973366	Not that you care.
973426	978008	Anyway, Flo Walks, since you have a microphone, why don't you let us know how was your week, how was your day?
979228	1000856	Um, the week was different, because, um, as I just started, uh, my new job over at Princeton Review up in, uh, the city, and, uh, it's just really weird just seeing, like, just all the stuff that goes on, because mostly I do, like, um, I do a lot of, like, online-type QAs, so all the college applications they do online, I'm working on all that kind of stuff.
1001096	1008159	It's kind of funny, well, also kind of depressing in the sense that I'm sitting here thinking, I used to do this stuff for AltaVista about,
1009083	1035082	4 years ago and I got paid about 3 times as much to do the same exact work I'm doing now and you'd always think it would be like kind of opposite considering you know like inflation all kind of stuff like yeah now I'd be making more since you know I've done it been there done that and it's just like regression and it's kind of a trippy feeling really um other than that it's just mostly been yeah just busy type of work week and then it's all on the personal side
1035441	1039504	I've actually been up in SACTO this week and I'm just, you know, visiting friends, you know, that kind of stuff.
1040064	1043786	It's kind of getting reacquainted with, uh, more games and all that jazz.
1043806	1046628	Been, like, playing Smackdown vs. Raw ad nauseum now.
1047509	1048810	And, uh, let's see.
1049490	1050631	Gosh, it's, um...
1051769	1053890	Yeah, it's been a pretty tame week, all things considered.
1053910	1064794	Well, now this coming week, we've got the whole Ultramix 2 thing coming out and stuff, so I'm sort of, you know, kind of thinking here, well, what can I officially disclaim, you know, as of right now?
1064814	1068495	Yeah, it's like, what parts of the NDA can I blab about now?
1068515	1072677	But it's got to be a little bit of a relief now that most of the song list is out there, that you can kind of go...
1073803	1076964	Oh, and for the record, I did not leave Konami in the first place.
1077405	1090870	As I see in the chat room, I was actually laid off, which is actually... It's a little something that I'll probably get into later, because it's probably an interesting note about what goes on, you know, the inner workings of a crazy lab like that.
1090890	1093551	There's been lots of shake-ups in the video game world lately.
1093571	1095052	We'll get into that.
1095072	1096512	We'll get into one of the other ones later.
1096993	1098773	Yeah, yeah, funny enough.
1099193	1102855	But let's see, and then, you know, like I said, today, now it's just like...
1103243	1108925	Since I was up in Sacto, I figured, what the heck, you know, I'll just come on to Orange Lounge and show them a good time or something.
1108965	1114266	And it's really weird, because normally I have Shark Skrull with me, and she's not here, and it's kind of bummed.
1114406	1115847	Maybe she's listening.
1116867	1117747	Perhaps.
1119028	1122149	But she was up here one time when I wasn't, so I think we're catching up.
1122329	1123209	That was a long time ago.
1123229	1123849	It was years ago.
1123889	1125510	But yes, she was here one time when you weren't.
1125550	1126030	I remember that.
1126350	1126710	Okay.
1127010	1128851	But once I laid off, I see on the...
1131239	1132520	Well, you knew it was going to come up.
1132740	1133240	Well, yeah.
1133300	1139744	Well, I mean, it's really not a surprise for anyone who hasn't been familiar with the game industry or just QA in general.
1140324	1145888	Usually you're commissioned as, you know, working on a single project or just projects when they're available.
1146368	1151731	The way the video game industry works is usually they'll get their games around springtime or like early summer.
1152652	1157815	I mean, usually they start doing QA for demos for like E3, you know, just to make sure things are stable enough.
1158456	1158876	And then...
1160420	1163604	Once that goes around, then obviously you go into development, and of course you need testers.
1164085	1166127	And then you test throughout the summer through like early fall.
1166427	1175298	Then once all the products get pushed out, I mean... Because everything, the big time for the gaming season is Christmas, so basically the games are being tested a couple months before then, right?
1175578	1175818	Right.
1175938	1180179	But you don't see a lot of big games coming out in January, February, unless you're Nintendo this year.
1180199	1188942	I don't... Nintendo has huge games coming out, but... But, um... Well, yeah, we got, okay, a few here and there, but even Suikoden IV was supposed to be out Christmas, wasn't it?
1188962	1189662	Yeah, it was.
1189682	1195304	It was supposed to be part of that big Konami extravaganza blowout thingamabob, but, um... Sunday, Sunday, Sunday!
1195324	1198645	Yeah.
1198885	1203506	But once the, uh, around November rolls around, it's like, well, they don't have any projects left.
1203526	1205087	I mean, the only thing you really do, like,
1205627	1211511	At Konami, for example, once all that's done, you'll probably either be doing a few text checks or you're doing customer service.
1211991	1215734	What really I found curious was they downsized customer service.
1215754	1225320	And you would think, around this time when all their new tiles are coming out, you need people to support people like, well, this game is crashing on my PC.
1225340	1229903	And that's like 90% of any problems people have, like issues with Konami is,
1231015	1231576	PC GAMES
1253891	1258695	I want to address a couple of points that are in our chat room, www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on chat.
1259696	1264280	Toshin says, if you aren't a part of X company, isn't the NDA dissolved?
1264780	1267923	Oh no, that's hardly the case.
1268163	1271986	I mean, you can essentially say, yeah, I worked on it.
1272046	1273768	You can say something specific.
1274068	1280033	But NDA is kind of like, they use that for stuff like, well, obviously I couldn't tell you what kind of software they used for, you know,
1280493	1281735	I don't have a look.
1281755	1283556	I happen to be doing my homework here.
1283577	1285118	Jamie just pulled out her big business law textbook.
1303337	1305198	It's just going to thumb through it, see what it says.
1305278	1309279	It's essentially, I mean, to protect more or less like intellectual property of Konami.
1309359	1314181	I would compare it to, let's say, the folks that go on that game show Survivor, right?
1314221	1315662	You've got 16 people that go on the show.
1316062	1317922	The damn thing's taped months in advance.
1317942	1328706	They already know who won the damn thing, or at least they know who the two finalists are, but the contestants are still all under that gag order where they can't talk about it until it airs on TV or else they get sued for $11 billion.
1330367	1332929	Yeah, yeah, that's essentially what it all boils down to.
1333069	1335852	I mean, I have no problem adhering to that or any of that kind of stuff.
1335892	1337493	Yeah, you don't want to get sued for $11 billion.
1337533	1342698	Yeah, and you don't want to lose your job just because, you know, you want to sound cool and like, oh yeah, I got the inside scoop.
1343338	1352246	I mean, it's a good thing that at least I'm pretty close with Jason, you know, it's because most of the stuff we do is DDR related, so anytime I ever even like
1352864	1357086	GetTempted to say anything, I'd talk to him first and be like, you know, is this cool, is this cool?
1358066	1360787	I knew that Delirium was going to be on Ultramix 2 before any of you.
1360847	1362168	My internet penis is huge!
1362208	1363688	I have it if you're ready, by the way.
1363708	1364408	Oh, okay, yes.
1364448	1367590	Yeah, I mean, it's, yeah, there, I mean, you'd be surprised.
1367610	1377173	There are actually people who come to work for, you know, Konami at the time, and, like, one day they'll say, yeah, Rumble Roses was in office, and, you know, stuff like that, and, like, the guy will just get canned, like, in one hour.
1378074	1378334	So...
1380267	1388128	They're pretty serious about stuff like that, but I mean, overall, as long as you know when to say when, it's not a bad thing.
1389082	1389462	Interesting.
1389662	1390683	Jamie, yes, your textbook.
1390703	1391503	The textbook definition.
1393224	1401567	NDAs have been around for a long time and traditionally have been used among lawyers, investment bankers, and others involved in trade takeovers and other large corporate deals.
1402007	1409169	NDAs swear the signatory to secrecy about confidential ideas, trade secrets, and other non-public information revealed by the party proffering the NDA.
1409950	1415992	So it's an actual contract and it's binding despite employment and anything else.
1417413	1418013	There you have it.
1419094	1420434	So in other words, you ain't talking!
1420954	1421975	You ain't gonna make me talk!
1421995	1426516	I mean, basically, if you said, yeah, X-Song is gonna be in DDR, you could be sued for breach of contract.
1427176	1429977	Oh yeah, but see, that's why I let everyone else handle all that.
1430057	1434419	I mean, it's really gone to the point... Although at the same time, is it really that big a deal?
1435239	1442881	Yes, and... I guess so, with the licenses, it could be, but especially when some licenses get cut right before the game comes out, I mean, that could be a big deal.
1442901	1444922	Oh yeah, I mean, you know, if not for people...
1445461	1472568	basically going through and like hacking party collection you would have you know you wouldn't have known about the songs that never made it into DDR for you know whatever reason or all that kind of stuff and funny enough it's usually licenses first that you know are often announced because obviously you need something to sell the game and you know you want to give the public something that's a familiar uh title that they can relate to like they say oh wow you know such and such artist yeah they're popular wow they got them in DDR that must be you know
1472967	1473167	DarkSakura
1493035	1494035	All right, well, fair enough.
1494416	1495136	That's what you got to do.
1495236	1497097	All right, moving on.
1497137	1500118	We were doing How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day before we got on that little tangent, but that was a good tangent.
1500138	1501779	I actually forgot to mention something that happened during my week.
1501899	1503200	Okay.
1503400	1506461	I sprained my wrist, and they put me in a cast on Thursday, and I cut it off.
1509302	1510583	You took the law into your own hands?
1510603	1512624	You took the law of medicine into your own hands?
1512784	1515105	Yeah, and I'm not wearing my brace either because it sucks.
1516420	1517100	Okay, I'm done.
1517120	1518980	Do you have any pictures of you and the cast, though?
1519040	1522201	I do, I have one online, but since I can't access the chatroom, I can't post it.
1523081	1529682	I know, for some reason, I don't know why, but other side IRC, the network only lets two simultaneous connections from our house.
1529762	1540424	Actually, go to www.darksakura.com slash images slash fuckcast.jpg Okay, I will put that in and then post it in the chatroom if somebody doesn't beat me to it.
1541044	1542105	In the meantime, Loki!
1542985	1543365	How was your week?
1543385	1543785	How was your day?
1545683	1547825	My week was, you know, it was okay.
1548325	1548946	It was fine.
1549066	1550947	Until I got this fucking headache today!
1551368	1552969	And then it went really shitty!
1555091	1556292	I don't understand it.
1556372	1558073	I get headaches on Sundays.
1559394	1559835	Why?
1560796	1562177	It's always on Sundays.
1562317	1564779	It's always a sinus pressure headache.
1566560	1568122	I think I'm allergic to something in this house.
1568182	1568842	It's gotta be.
1570604	1573026	But, yeah, I have a bad headache.
1574099	1577721	and it's only on Sundays, so it must be Jamie.
1581142	1583823	It was before she came over.
1583983	1586464	Yeah, I'm hypoallergenic.
1587685	1593867	So, yeah, it hurts and I'm trying to, I'm looking up home remedies on the internet right now.
1595288	1596368	I have all the remedy here.
1596548	1598229	It's called Vicks VapoRub in a tube.
1599449	1600430	All I have to say is...
1601325	1603086	This week was a lot of Final Fantasy.
1603386	1609090	I played a lot of Final Fantasy, leveling my characters, and then what else did I do?
1609130	1610031	I did some other stuff.
1610091	1617476	I think I played some more Vice City, or not Vice City, San Andreas, and that's pretty much it.
1618576	1619137	Slow week.
1621018	1622019	So, yeah, that's about all.
1624060	1625141	Alright, my week and my day.
1625441	1626862	I played a lot of Halo 2 this week.
1627964	1629646	Which I'm sure a lot of you guys are very proud to hear.
1630427	1637834	I'll tell you what though, man, we were talking about this a little bit on Outside the Box on Thursday, but the Xbox Live stuff is so detailed, it's crazy.
1638015	1648506	Being able to go onto Bungie.net and see your statistics down to, you can pull up a map of a game you just played and look at where you were killed and when, by who, it's crazy.
1648566	1649567	And what weapon they used to kill you?
1650196	1652098	It's just insane the amount of statistics they have for that.
1652138	1653499	So I've been having fun playing that online.
1653879	1655580	Although yesterday I did not have fun.
1655600	1656981	Well, I'll get into that in the FU's of the week.
1658322	1661205	And then, what else did I do this week?
1662025	1663587	I'm not a whole lot Bomani related.
1664327	1667470	Because of Halo 2, my DDR diet fizzled pretty quickly there.
1668493	1668753	Coincidence?
1687318	1688579	Absolutely not.
1689899	1696162	As far as the rest of my week and my day, I didn't really do a whole lot, although I did go to Rice Princess, you know her from Outside the Box on Thursday nights.
1696583	1704886	She had her Harry Potter birthday party on Friday, and that was a lot of fun because we drank butter beer, and I drank all sorts of liquor, and I passed out on the floor.
1704986	1709909	In great tradition of me going to a party at Rice Princess and Lanky Styles' house, I passed out halfway through the party.
1710909	1714251	And I really, I lost big time on Harry Potter trivia.
1714331	1714911	That made me sad.
1715834	1719055	But you know, since I don't read the books, I was kind of screwed from the beginning.
1719716	1721016	But then, this is the weird thing.
1721336	1725958	Then, the next night, after the Harry Potter party, the next night, what do they show on TV?
1726438	1728299	Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.
1728659	1729200	Coincidence?
1730080	1731160	I think not.
1733961	1735242	I think it's a big fat coincidence.
1736260	1736700	You shut up.
1738221	1738481	All right.
1738981	1740281	That's pretty much it for my week of my day.
1740341	1741761	I don't have a whole lot exciting to report.
1743002	1745843	Although there is a lot of interesting stuff going on locally.
1745903	1747963	Now, I know that we are an international show.
1748003	1751044	We've got listeners in Canada, Japan, everywhere, and all across the U.S.
1751364	1755965	But sometimes we like to talk about what's going on in our neck of the woods here in NorCal, in Sacramento, the area where we're at.
1756365	1757866	We've heard a very interesting rumor.
1757946	1762627	And, Mel, you actually were the one that started perpetuating this rumor, because I guess you've heard this from the horse's mouth.
1764008	1765768	Well, you'll get the point in a second.
1765868	1769809	Derby Owners Club is coming to Sacramento from Milpitas.
1770069	1770990	It's leaving Milpitas.
1771030	1771410	Bye-bye.
1771570	1774851	And it's coming to Roseville Golf Land where games go to die.
1775591	1779032	Yes, that does put a tear in my eye.
1780513	1784154	I guess probably there's a couple reasons why it's coming up there.
1784814	1794257	I think it's gone to the point where Milpitas, you know, you had a lot of people who were interested in the beginning and obviously it garnered a lot of, you know, people coming through a lot of traffic.
1794807	1799730	And then a couple factors, I mean you got D&B which is like about a mile and a half, two miles away which has it.
1800230	1807835	It obviously pulls a lot of money and I think some of the older folks like going there for the simple fact you can actually like get drunk and play.
1807895	1808435	Exactly.
1808896	1809976	And you know all that kind of stuff.
1810117	1812058	And you don't have to deal with birthday parties.
1812518	1813679	Just seriously.
1814159	1818742	So and obviously Roseville is a pretty high traffic area I mean from what I hear.
1819680	1821420	and there's none left.
1821440	1826042	Yes, if you love underage girls in bikinis, you will love Roseville Golf Land.
1827282	1828542	I love Roseville Golf Land.
1829102	1829523	I heart.
1831443	1840465	It's going to be the first one up in that region of California, like SACTO, and I know there are a lot of people up here who liked the game and had come down and played it and still keep their horses around.
1841065	1843066	And yes, Derby Owners Club is like
1843596	1845216	Initial D for Rednecks.
1845396	1851538	I know for a fact from last week's show, Iguana Girl and Islander are all about Derby Owners Club.
1851578	1852478	They'll be there.
1853238	1856999	I will have to hang my head in shame and go into that place, and I swore I'd never go back.
1857279	1859859	But it doesn't just end with Derby Owners Club.
1859879	1860579	That's the weird thing.
1861560	1863620	Jamie, I know you're going to go in for Derby Owners Club.
1863680	1864120	You've got to.
1864300	1865400	And maybe get some kids thrown out.
1865420	1867281	My horses were stolen, so why?
1868401	1869121	You have to make new ones.
1869673	1871034	I'll hook you up with some of my breeds.
1871234	1872295	There you go.
1872395	1873436	I miss my tiger horse.
1873816	1874196	There you go.
1875337	1877779	But the weird thing is, now we're hearing this crazy rumor.
1877939	1878900	Crazy rumor!
1879680	1882342	I don't even know if I should say it, but I have a big mouth, so I'm going to.
1882822	1884604	I figure if it's posted on the internet, I can say it.
1885744	1887085	If it's on the internet, it must be true.
1887246	1891549	If it's on the internet, it must be true, but rumor is that Sacramento is going to get 2DX again.
1892469	1894531	And it's coming courtesy of Camelot Golf Land.
1894551	1894931	Sorry, guys.
1895663	1899384	That's the rumor we hear, that Camelot Golfland's 2DX machine is coming up here.
1899504	1900424	I'm sorry, but not really.
1901104	1909266	I don't... I think that's a little more... I think the source is more reliable than the usual 2DX is coming to my neck of the woods source.
1910366	1916487	But I still have such skepticism, because I just... And the rumor is it's supposed to be upgraded to red by the time it gets there.
1916908	1917228	Yippee!
1917568	1918548	But the thing is, is that...
1919386	1931911	I just, I would be so scared for that machine because it would die very quickly when all the kids start pounding on it with their wet little Golfland slide fingers and just, the Monty machines don't deserve to be treated that way.
1932772	1933312	No, they don't.
1933972	1942696	But I mean, I think, like I said, it's, when it all boils down to the bottom line, I mean, are more people going to come out to, like, friggin' Livermore to go play 2DX or, like, Sacto?
1943496	1944917	I mean, you take your pick.
1947472	1948793	What, are you talking on Sacramento now?
1948873	1949413	I'm kidding.
1949453	1954697	No, I'm just, no, I was saying, you know, people are going to come to SACTO, not Livermore, you know, or whatever Camelot is.
1954737	1955678	That is Livermore, yeah.
1956058	1957079	I think, I don't know.
1957399	1957499	Oh.
1958499	1960380	No, I think that's in the south somewhere.
1961441	1962302	It's the Anaheim.
1962562	1963242	Oh, the Anaheim one?
1963323	1964203	Oh, okay, my bad.
1964263	1964683	I think.
1965424	1965924	Okay.
1967005	1967646	I don't know.
1967666	1967746	Wow.
1967766	1968686	I'm not sure about geography.
1968726	1969407	That's right, that's right.
1969647	1972589	I think that's the one that has the really bad tunnel vision screen.
1973050	1974691	Oh, the one where you have to... No, no, no, that was Shiggle.
1974711	1975151	That was Shiggle.
1975171	1976652	Shiggle had the night vision one.
1976692	1978854	But didn't Shiggle's machine go to Camelot?
1979414	1981376	I'd not be surprised when Shiggle closed down.
1981396	1981776	I think so.
1981796	1984678	I think Shiggle's machine went to Camelot, and now it might be coming to Rozo.
1985839	1988521	Shiggle is now an apartment complex, if I remember right.
1988641	1990663	Yeah, Shiggle is dead like disco.
1992945	1993946	Too many acronyms!
1997588	1997849	Alright.
1998890	2000090	Well, we'll see if that's true or not.
2000110	2001812	We do know the Derby Owners Club thing is true.
2002072	2003393	Where did you hear that from, anyway?
2003713	2007797	Um, I actually heard that from the management, from Milpitas Golf and Management himself.
2008137	2008597	Wow.
2009418	2010619	I bet they were sad to see it go.
2011351	2017754	I don't know, I mean, I mean, yeah, they're obviously, you know, kind of sad, but At least there's more space for the birthday parties!
2018214	2037622	That's probably part of the reason, but I think, like I said, more so, it got to the point where they'd already, like, capped out as far as how many people will play, it's like, you kind of go to a point where you start low, start low, and then you eventually start getting a lot of, you know, people playing, and then, like, almost any other game, you outgrow it, and there was only, like,
2038163	2041084	So many hardcore people that still stayed around and played.
2041144	2044266	I mean, they're obviously in an uproar right now.
2044426	2047847	But it's like they're having their farewell send-off this weekend.
2047867	2049628	Like, they had a G1 tournament.
2050088	2052289	So it's like they have a bunch of people playing.
2052329	2053690	It's like a hundred bucks to enter.
2054250	2054751	Jeez.
2055191	2058712	Seriously, these people are like freaking jeez when it comes to playing this game.
2058752	2066456	I mean, they're like, yeah, I got a 30th generation, you know, Thunderboy Princess, and he can't be beat on dirt, and et cetera, et cetera, and...
2067501	2072067	It's, I mean, I'd be into tournaments if it didn't cost a hundred bucks a pop to play, you know.
2072528	2074230	Is it true that there's celebrities that come to play?
2074731	2075572	Um, yeah, actually.
2076113	2082241	It's funny enough, um, the people that, like, as far as celebrities that are interested in it are mostly athletes.
2082773	2083314	D&B, Milpitas, Santa Clara
2098957	2099277	and a lot more.
2130276	2130576	All right.
2131977	2136720	Well, hopefully, maybe we'll start seeing some celebrities at Roseville Golf Line, though I doubt it.
2136780	2137240	You never know.
2137260	2139061	You probably might see some... Maybe Schwarzenegger.
2139081	2140682	That's the only celebrity that lives in Sacramento.
2141002	2142303	Oh, that and, like, the Kings.
2143984	2145185	Oh, bastard, you horse!
2147566	2148426	I'm going to whip you!
2148867	2149707	I'm going to whip you!
2150328	2152269	I'm going to whip you like the Indian casinos!
2153049	2154450	If you do not win, I will gulp you!
2158228	2159489	On that note, we're going to go to a break.
2159769	2160890	We're going to continue the... Girly horse!
2162130	2162891	Girly horse!
2162911	2163951	You're a girly horse!
2164011	2165312	A silly little girly horse.
2168414	2169675	Welcome to Orange Laundry, everybody.
2170075	2173837	I am going to get to that announcement, but we'll go to a break first, because I like announcements after breaks.
2173857	2174397	It's just me.
2175238	2181962	In this break, another brand new Ultramix 2 song, as spoiled by the website, which went up over the weekend.
2181982	2184063	If you want a link to that, just visit orangelaundry.com.
2184083	2184803	We have a link right there.
2185083	2186064	It's like our top news story.
2187065	2187445	Enter...
2189133	2194396	In this break, oh hello, we're just joined by Explicit randomly during that break.
2194416	2195977	That's alright, we're going to go to a break right now.
2198099	2204082	This song is, the interesting thing about this song, it's also in that other dancing game.
2204603	2206924	And we'll talk about that and how interesting that must be.
2207244	2210967	The song is Vanilla Ninja and it's called Tough Enough.
2211943	2212984	I really like this song.
2213104	2214104	Oh, it's an awesome song.
2214164	2216705	And it was like my favorite song in that other dancing game.
2216725	2217866	We're going to talk about that when we come back.
2218446	2219306	We'll be right back after this.
2220547	2228610	Baby, I'll be the strong one to survive All for me to be the light
2245238	2247961	and the Lonely Freak, Queen of the Broken Shield.
2248041	2254085	So keep on picking the palm leaves, pick it, don't stop, don't feel, run away, go for the fire, baby, that's up to now.
2254146	2260331	So keep on living, don't stop, even the devil, we can get you in the season of heartbreak, baby, that's up to now.
2286811	2298291	Never trust my smiley face Because I can change all your dreams And my tears can't fade
2303917	2315847	Don't keep on thinking the bomb is ticking, don't stop, don't fear, run away before the fire, baby, that's up to none Don't keep on living the song, not even the devil's free, get you in the deep of the heartbreak, baby, that's up to none

2412185	2423635	All right, we're going to do one more song here in this Ultramix 2 break.
2423655	2426157	We're going to do... Whoops, nope, not that.
2426217	2427017	That's not in Ultramix 2.
2427618	2430140	We're going to do... Which one did I want to do here?
2430220	2430700	Ah, here it is.
2431301	2432482	This is an interesting song.
2432562	2435444	The band is called Or If Is.
2436245	2437046	Like, or if is.
2437266	2437586	Get it?
2437906	2439768	And it's called I Spy.
2440328	2440709	Enjoy.
2443813	2444855	Thanks for watching!
2479077	2479747	Thanks for watching!
2552457	2561204	easier to dance to than that freaking catch up song Orange Lounge Radio we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio and that break you heard or if this or if this
2583009	2589052	Or if it isn't, with a song called I Spy, and before that, Vanilla Ninja with Tough Enough.
2589952	2597735	Now, I remember when I first heard that song, I was kind of like, wait a minute, I've heard this before.
2598215	2599916	And I was like, where the hell have I heard this before?
2600516	2605198	Oh my god, this song was on In The Groove when I went back and played it in Jersey a few months ago.
2606618	2607198	Coincidence?
2607258	2608219	What the hell happened there?
2608679	2621684	I don't know, but I would be surprised if, you know, I mean, because Vanilla Ninja is a German group, I would be surprised if they just kind of like were of the opinion, hey, let's whore out our song to, you know, as many people as possible, and that very well might have been the case.
2621844	2631128	Now, obviously, since, you know, games are tested and planned for months in advance, this song was included in Ultimix 2 before In The Groove was ever released, right?
2631884	2633805	Honestly, I don't know the timing on that one.
2634065	2634845	I'm pretty sure it was.
2635485	2637145	I think so, but we'll see.
2638626	2640166	So, this is very interesting.
2640466	2641546	Anything else you want to share?
2641927	2644007	It's the only song in Ultramix 2 that has a video, right?
2645047	2646048	That has a music video?
2646148	2647428	It does have a music video, yes.
2648348	2649268	Interesting.
2650069	2652089	And they're not some bad-looking girls, either.
2652829	2659991	I mean, kind of like, you know, take Vixen or any of those female hair metal bands and kind of pop them up a little, and yeah.
2661206	2667629	you got Vanilla Ninja and they actually have a website out there and all that kind of stuff and I wish I knew German so I could get myself a free autograph.
2669070	2673532	So if anyone can do some German translation for me, holler back.
2674172	2675052	Autograph bitte.
2677813	2679914	So can you tell us anything else about the video?
2680715	2684336	Because I'm assuming if we could look hard enough we could probably find the video, but I don't know.
2686504	2688226	It's a pretty, you know, rockin' video.
2688306	2690368	It's like, obviously you've got the vampires playing.
2690688	2700957	I guess the best way to describe it in a nutshell is, if you took Christina Aguilera's Dirty video and made it, like, presentable so, like, the ESRB wouldn't nail us.
2701217	2705521	It's kind of, well, it's just more so the setting, but it's a cool video.
2705541	2710224	I mean, it's a hell of a lot less scandalous than Do That Thing from Ultramix One, so...
2712166	2715467	Oh no, we're talking about Vanilla Ninja's Tough Enough from Ultramix 2.
2717128	2721229	Yeah, like you said, I know you've been out of it, but there's a whole lot of Ultramix 2 news this week, so.
2723209	2723669	That's alright.
2725590	2737633	Well, actually, if you want to see, because actually the way we know that that video is in there is that actually if you go to the Ultramix 2 website, there's still one of the screenshots they have has the video in it, so you can kind of get a little glimpse of what it looks like there, so.
2737673	2737794	So.
2739721	2741823	But they're easy on the eyes, for the most part.
2743064	2743464	Definitely.
2743824	2750429	I think, actually, because when somebody on DDR Freak made the connection that that was the Vanilla Ninja video, I think they actually linked to the video, I want to say.
2750769	2752210	See, I think you can go check it out over there.
2752270	2753932	I just was too lazy to check it out myself.
2755773	2756073	All right.
2757995	2760557	So, moving on, we just got some more guests in the house here.
2761557	2762638	Like you, Sal, how was your week?
2762678	2764359	How was your day?
2764600	2765000	Pretty good.
2765060	2765740	It's been working.
2766301	2766501	Yep.
2767962	2770906	Wow, it's so weird to hear you and work together.
2770926	2771546	You know what?
2771586	2772428	Fuck you, buddy.
2773289	2776893	It's so weird to hear you and attractive in the same sentence.
2777514	2778776	Wait, nobody said that, though.
2778856	2780158	Anyway, yeah, just have the big...
2781141	2781361	and so on.
2800063	2804184	So at one point I was like, god damn it, and I just went to the first place, I knew where there was a bed.
2804504	2808165	I wasn't exactly going to go into your roommate's room and pass out on their bed.
2808325	2809345	That would have been interesting.
2809365	2811346	That would have been kind of funny, actually.
2811386	2812986	Yeah, but we don't need to get into that.
2813126	2814046	That's right, that's right.
2814367	2818147	Anyway, other than that, been working and making the dough.
2819168	2820608	Yep, good stuff.
2820768	2821468	Alright, good stuff.
2822348	2824209	Explicit also joined us during the break there.
2824249	2825069	How was your week, how was your day?
2826700	2827180	Thanks for watching!
2841691	2842692	Well, sort of, in a way.
2842792	2845574	So what, you have like your weekend bed and your weekday bed?
2845834	2850276	Or is there one bedroom that's for the ladies, and then one bedroom... Oh, yeah!
2851357	2860303	Speaking of ladies, speaking of ladies, I'm supposed to go to a strip club like next two weeks to celebrate to my cousin's 18th birthdays.
2862124	2863284	Guess I'm gonna have to eat some pussy again.
2866246	2866787	You know what?
2866827	2867247	Go club.
2867567	2868308	I don't need to hear that.
2871744	2872746	Gold Club Center Poles.
2872866	2875270	Wow, I was wondering when this show was going to go in the toilet.
2875290	2875671	Thank you.
2877614	2878837	But I missed what it was about.
2879277	2879879	That's quite all right.
2880500	2881341	Anyway.
2884815	2885936	I already talked about Halo 2.
2886396	2889818	That was pretty much my week.
2891699	2894061	Anything new going on at Paradise Island, the place where you work?
2894081	2894901	You're still working there, right?
2894981	2895401	Yeah.
2895562	2896242	Anything new going on?
2896262	2898343	We might get a new arcade vendor.
2898603	2903086	There's a possibility since, for some stupid reason, they're not opening up their machines anymore.
2903927	2907369	Because pad vending is like... I think we're losing contract and stuff.
2908269	2912812	We might get a vendor from the Bay Area and stuff so we can get... Oh, yeah.
2913700	2916342	So I could talk to them by trying to get Beatmania 2DX read there.
2916362	2917782	That'd be nice.
2919543	2920004	Interesting.
2921365	2921745	Interesting.
2922785	2925987	Is it a bitch to work through a vendor?
2927868	2928649	Hell yeah!
2928989	2931290	I had a deal with them during the last tournament for FU.
2933932	2938415	Well, I'm not sure if I had a deal with them again in February for Sacktown Smackdown tournament.
2939535	2942397	Yes, I'm organizing another tournament in Sacramento.
2942895	2944156	All right, we'll be there, I'm sure.
2944676	2946137	It's early February.
2946357	2947018	I'm sure we'll be there.
2947999	2948279	All right.
2948879	2950200	Let's see.
2950460	2952362	I'm just preparing for SVGL3.
2955604	2958206	SVGL3, the tournament in December.
2959670	2961511	That's right, I completely forgot about that.
2961811	2962812	I'm definitely going to that.
2962832	2964513	I just kind of forgot that it was right around the corner.
2965193	2967134	Didn't they announce that tournament, like, months ago?
2967655	2972017	Yeah, it was supposedly during the summertime, but they moved it to the winter, I'm assuming.
2972658	2973298	Yeah, interesting.
2973358	2979281	And it was supposedly canceled because I assume, like, DCB doesn't want to be the main organizer for it anymore.
2979682	2981483	Well, I'm sure somebody will pick it up if he didn't want to.
2981523	2982283	I don't know what's going on.
2982383	2983664	Someone else picked it up already.
2983744	2986065	I've been so out of the loop on that stuff.
2986105	2988827	I was so out of the loop ever since the drama and shit coming around.
2991353	2993935	And for the downs I'll announce later.
3011914	3014615	It's going to be one hell of a ride for the FUs on that one.
3014835	3016796	I'm looking forward to it.
3018837	3023439	I kind of didn't get to talk enough about the whole Vanilla Ninja coincidence there within the groove and stuff.
3024140	3026401	Are you afraid of the backlash that might be coming?
3027182	3028363	I don't know, kind of hard to say.
3029203	3031144	You know there's going to be critics out there.
3032225	3038248	You already kind of know that with the step data, that's the first thing people always complain about with the new DDR mix is the steps.
3038588	3040769	Somebody will not like the steps, that's just a given.
3041389	3046292	But now you've got the fact that now people have something they're going to keep comparing it to, and it's kind of like, ugh.
3048073	3069004	I didn't like the competition stepped out of very much, and I'm not saying that, you know, as a biased opinion, I mean, I got more or less a lot of confidence in the people who I know who did the stepped out of for Ultramix 2, but in the groove, I mean, you know, obviously that's where it came from, obviously, it's like, you know, I mean, there's some, it's,
3070040	3092190	almost half of it was like what you would expect already but they have a knack for throwing in like odd rhythms for like no reason right like yeah you just kind of wonder if they're listening to the same song you are you know but that's just hopefully it's not the same edit oh no no not I'll try like I said if I can say ours is better obviously ours is different okay and you know I mean I have to you know personally
3092930	3097372	You know, back it up because I did do some of the step data for some of the modes.
3097812	3100513	I think it's interesting more than anything else.
3100793	3103054	You're going to have the same song in two different games.
3103414	3105936	Two different cuts and two different sets of steps.
3106016	3108076	Very interesting to see the differences there.
3110276	3111877	At least yours isn't going to have mines, right?
3112977	3113657	Oh, God, no.
3113677	3114117	Thank you.
3114157	3114418	All right.
3114538	3119700	And for the record, I saw Miklatov make a comment about, like, all the girls being looking like men.
3119980	3120480	No, they don't.
3120580	3123541	Only the one girl who has the bad, like, 70s ABBA hair.
3123941	3127402	Only, you know, yeah, her bangs kind of throw her off, but she cleaned up since.
3128123	3128803	All right.
3129303	3132184	And they still have that one girl, the youngest girl, who looks like Pornikova.
3132204	3133425	Pornikova.
3134045	3134285	Yeah.
3134935	3136836	Anything that looks like Pornokova is good to me.
3160149	3169173	This year we have 18 November, which is going to be the big day that 8th Style Consumer Version is out, Poppin' Music 10 is out, and DDR Festival is all going to come out.
3169313	3174175	And now we find out Ultramix 2 got pushed back to an 18 November ship day.
3174575	3176876	So the Americans get in on it too a little bit.
3176956	3178416	So it's going to be a very big week.
3178756	3181838	So this week's show, this next week's show is going to be huge.
3182418	3184479	Tonight we're just mediocre, but next week, huge.
3185694	3186935	This is an orgy waiting to happen.
3217103	3221404	I just read this from Bimani Style about last Tuesday.
3221464	3227665	DJ Paranoia posted that Jason Eno is wanting to bring out 2DX in the US.
3229305	3230626	What is your reaction about that?
3231686	3237367	Obviously, who in the Bimani community would not want to see 2DX in America?
3238047	3243048	There's no doubt that there has been enough music games within the past
3243695	3243915	3-4 years
3266303	3270785	How much are people going to pay for a peripheral to a game that is completely, absolutely new?
3271205	3272106	You're not sure about that?
3272146	3279009	Then you've got to think... But maybe the success of games like Donkey Konga and hopefully Taiko Drum Master, maybe that would be incentive, hopefully.
3279029	3279889	Okay, that's true.
3280029	3280149	Maybe.
3280169	3283131	Alright, well let's take it one step further.
3284332	3287855	You got people, like I said, B-Money fans who would like to see, you know, a US version.
3287875	3288876	They probably would want to buy it.
3288936	3292579	That said, how difficult do you make it on the get-go?
3293179	3296142	I mean, you know, do you want to make it easy enough for people to get it?
3296162	3299805	Because, I mean, truth be told, 2DX is not an easy B-Money, you know.
3300445	3300505	No.
3300525	3311549	I mean, like, when you compare, you know, like, the major four, for example, like, I'll say 2DX, like, if you take the hardest song from DDR compared to, like, the hardest song in Guitar Freaks to, like, you know, 2DX, I mean, 2DX is a pretty difficult game.
3311909	3319132	I mean, you know, I mean, of course it can be beat within reasonable time and such, but then you gotta think, you know, it's like, well, are we gonna have a beginner mode for US?
3319192	3323174	Are we only gonna make it up to, like, you know, the hardest song is maybe just the normal seven?
3323214	3324374	Is it gonna be a flashing seven?
3324755	3332096	You gotta wonder about, like, being able to appease new fans, but at the same time, you don't want to insult the intelligence of, like... The loyalists.
3332156	3340538	Yeah, of the, you know, hardcore people, so it's kind of a hard... I think, I mean, just coming from me, I think that would be a little bit of a hard thing to gauge.
3340558	3345259	I mean, I don't think it's impossible, and I mean, like anyone, I would like to see it come over.
3345639	3347499	Whether it will or not, I mean, you never know.
3347679	3351640	I mean, obviously, with the success Fiamani has been having, it's...
3352957	3356578	It's making a case stronger and stronger each day, so whenever it happens, you know.
3356938	3362040	From your perspective, having been on the inside at one point, is there anything you think we could do as Pomani fans to help?
3362120	3364721	Like, are petitions going to help, or is it a lost cause, or what?
3364741	3365901	Well, I don't know.
3366021	3370783	I have really yet to see a petition really, you know, like, make a difference in anything.
3370943	3371183	Right.
3371503	3377285	You know, I mean, last time I ever saw that was part of recall, but, you know, that's a whole different story altogether.
3377745	3379826	But, um, I think...
3380898	3389962	It's more or less, you really just got to support Bimani and you just got to, I mean, it doesn't hurt to drop a letter into customer service once in a while to Konami and say, yeah, we're really interested and all that kind of stuff.
3390042	3407448	I mean, sure, when you write it off and send it off, you think, ah, no one's ever going to pay attention, but you'd be surprised when like, you know, it's as a product manager, I noticed for like any video game, you always got to keep your eyes and ears open because, you know, just like the slightest bit of, you know, idea or just, you know, hints or suggestions people have,
3407878	3410659	You know, fans have a lot more influence than they think.
3410819	3417102	I mean, obviously, they're not going to make the game all by themselves, but I think you have to figure that kind of stuff.
3417202	3421424	I mean, if you want to have a successful game, you want people to buy it, you give them what they want, by and far.
3422664	3423224	Very interesting.
3424225	3425105	Very cool.
3425425	3428006	Siggy, anything else you want to ask for 4.1?
3428506	3430187	That's the only question I wanted to know.
3430407	3431067	Okay, cool.
3431348	3432448	Looking forward to 8-Style Consumer?
3435458	3435678	Yeah.
3435898	3436159	All right.
3436219	3440121	Call us back next week and let us know what you think because I'm too poor to get it, so I don't know if we're going to get to look at it.
3440161	3440722	Sure.
3440742	3441302	Thanks, guys.
3441502	3441843	All right.
3441863	3442903	Take it easy, man.
3443344	3443644	All right.
3443904	3444345	Bye-bye.
3445585	3446166	Very good question.
3446186	3452611	I did not know that that kind of stuff was posted over on Bomani Style, but that's what I get for not being in the loop on the different forums.
3453231	3455052	So, interesting.
3456232	3459878	All right, let's get to that big announcement while we wait for another call to come in.
3461099	3469932	One interesting thing that was brought up on the show last week is that, hmm, is there a possibility that in the future that Orange Lounge Radio and DDR Freak Radio might get together and do something?
3469952	3471214	And the answer is yes.
3473033	3483718	Starting this Friday, you'll be able to catch the Orange Lounge Radio Rewind over on DDR Freak Radio.
3483858	3484638	That's the big announcement.
3485219	3492042	And if you've been paying attention to DDR Freak's site feedback forum, you'd already know that because it was announced earlier today, but that's alright.
3493442	3498945	But maybe you want to go over to that forum and let them know what great news it is to hear that we're going to be doing that.
3499665	3507947	Hopefully we'll be able to have a Gwana Girl on the show again and do more kinds of things to partner up with DDR Freak Radio and let them know that there's lots of love for internet radio stations.
3508307	3509507	There's plenty of love for all of us.
3510727	3511387	So that's exciting.
3511667	3512508	I'm really excited.
3512608	3520209	I think it'll help open up our show to a whole new audience over there and I think it's going to bring their radio station something different.
3520689	3524330	I don't know if it's going to work out good for them because our show kind of sucks, but you know, no, I'm kidding.
3525430	3526090	Our show rocks.
3526190	3527151	Listen to it every week.
3528231	3528791	What, Lanky Sound?
3529468	3532710	I said, yeah, you've got self-confidence.
3532810	3533690	Let me put it this way.
3534551	3537412	If I wasn't confident in this show, I would have stopped on episode three or four.
3537792	3538513	This is 118 now.
3538713	3544075	Yeah, how long were you playing DDR?
3545576	3545856	Shut up.
3546737	3547037	All right.
3547477	3548718	How long were you playing DDR?
3549838	3550399	Excuse me?
3550519	3550719	Yeah.
3550919	3552280	Who was in Sacramento?
3552320	3553120	Yeah, that's what I thought.
3553140	3553680	Yeah, shut up.
3554141	3554361	Yeah.
3554381	3554361	1999. 1999.
3560447	3561828	How are you doing over there, DarkSakura, by the way?
3561848	3563648	I haven't heard a lot from you tonight, which is rare.
3564048	3565289	I hate my nose.
3565989	3566189	Aww.
3566870	3567790	So did Michael Jackson.
3568690	3571271	Yeah, but he had the money to go buy him a new one.
3571431	3574132	I need one that has completely dry sinuses.
3574172	3575753	Yeah, you just need new sinuses, though.
3576433	3577034	Yeah.
3577054	3577674	Your nose is fine.
3577714	3579815	I think I'm getting high off of this Vic stuff, though.
3579995	3580355	Awesome.
3581535	3588438	I'm doing my homework, so... Yeah, I'm doing my homework on ethics in business and contracts.
3589284	3590145	It's very boring.
3590365	3591066	Fascinating.
3592188	3594330	Very, very fascinating.
3594631	3596072	By fascinating, you mean boring.
3596133	3596954	Yes, it is.
3597715	3602761	To answer some questions from the chat room about the whole DDR Freak Radio syndication, it's going to be 6 p.m.
3603101	3605284	Pacific time on Friday.
3605544	3606105	That's awesome.
3606245	3607046	On DDR Freak Radio.
3607066	3607587	I'll be at work.
3608956	3610818	Well, tune in from work.
3610878	3611718	I don't know what to tell you.
3611738	3613620	You know, that's a good idea.
3613640	3614421	I have to try that.
3614501	3615161	You should try that.
3615181	3615622	There you go.
3616502	3621947	And just so you know, the Wednesday rewinds here on Orange Lounge Radio, they're going to change a little bit.
3621987	3630635	Since we have our rewinds over on DDR Freak Radio now, we're going to bring you classic and moldy episodes of Orange Lounge Radio that are freshly fermented.
3630895	3633557	So, like, year-old episodes we're going to start bringing you on Wednesday nights.
3633577	3634558	Like, old stuff, so...
3636360	3637261	That'll be the little change there.
3637321	3638403	Oh, we are getting another call.
3639144	3640906	I need to pay attention to the Skype line once in a while.
3640946	3642748	Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.
3644991	3646253	Well, Legend of Zaku here.
3646754	3647755	Hi, Zaku, how you doing?
3649662	3654964	Yeah, let me add a counterstatement to what they said about American 2DX release.
3655204	3655584	Okay.
3655984	3670288	Seeing as, you know, going on the basis of the last presidential election and the fact that a vast majority of this country is red, and I want to follow up on that word just to keep it there.
3670348	3670988	Wait, wait, wait.
3671328	3674509	Wouldn't that mean that 2DX Red might have some success here?
3674769	3675849	No, I didn't mean that.
3676230	3677430	What I meant is the red states.
3678360	3692924	In particular, the fact that you're releasing a seven key game with a turntable and the fact that it's going really fast and it's going to, you know, I don't know if we're prepared for the attention span that it will, because that will demand a lot.
3693544	3698726	Especially from Americans who are Alright, Mel's got his hand up.
3698766	3699526	Mel's got his hand up.
3699986	3706288	And I suppose that's why Omaha, of all places, got 2DX Red before everyone else in America.
3706728	3707268	Whom?
3708308	3709409	Hey, I live in New York.
3709429	3710809	Hey, I live in New York.
3710849	3712570	We're lucky my state has a 9-star.
3713590	3716331	And the only 9-star on the East Coast is my dad.
3716411	3719853	I'm sorry, were you saying something?
3721213	3723674	Basically, let me put it this way.
3726252	3728652	I don't know if 2DX will sell here.
3728872	3730073	Let me sum it up.
3730153	3739856	You're saying that basically, and your tangent to the election aside, ignoring all that, basically what you're saying in a nutshell is that America is too stupid for 2DX.
3740596	3741036	I don't know.
3741116	3741516	Maybe.
3741596	3742717	I'm not sure.
3743057	3747158	What you're mainly saying is that people who vote for somebody you don't agree with are stupid.
3747198	3748859	No, no, no.
3748879	3750919	You're misunderstanding my point.
3751199	3752460	You're misunderstanding me right now.
3752500	3752960	Look, listen.
3753717	3763900	What I'm trying to say is that in a video game country, you know, in a country where basically the vast majority of video games are like what?
3764220	3767061	Right now it's mostly, you know, Halo.
3768482	3772883	It's like first person shooting sports and fighting games.
3773543	3774844	Dancing games is up there.
3774904	3775764	It makes them, you know.
3776812	3797083	Make some highlights and a few, and took the limelight a little bit, but you're talking about something that, you know, I don't know, I mean, certain games, the same way that DDR supposedly came here, because it wasn't, it didn't plan this to arrive, it only came with a, it only came with like a few thousand copies, thinking that it wasn't going to sell, because of the cultural differences.
3797463	3798343	That's what I'm trying to say.
3798764	3801125	Okay, you know what, that sounds very familiar.
3801690	3805534	You actually sound like the president of Konami around circa 2000.
3806635	3811159	This is when Jason Neils had bought for about three years to get DDR in America.
3812640	3817885	Somehow Jason had begged and clawed and did everything in his power to get DDR released into America.
3818306	3822570	The president only made them press about 20,000 copies or so.
3822870	3823531	He was absolutely
3824011	3824652	Thank you for watching!
3842472	3861160	and that's not even counting the ones with like a bundle so and remember this is at a time when music games did not have nearly as much fanfare as it does now I mean now that not only do you have Konami but you know you had like people from harmonics that did frequency amplitude now you know karaoke revolution that you got the MTV you know so I'm just saying you know I mean it's legitimate
3862015	3865737	I can understand why there's only two forms of Bomani here, DDR and Karaoke Revolution.
3883331	3887775	Added a third and tried to expand gradually from what's already there in Japan.
3887815	3888455	I'm not sure.
3888616	3891458	I mean, I know both did well.
3891698	3892039	I don't know.
3892099	3902948	It's kind of like, in a sense, it might be a slippery slope on one side, but as long as fans can back it up and regular people can learn how to be tolerant and embrace it,
3903547	3906809	and there's a good chance he'll sell and make a repeat of the last two.
3907049	3909690	Alright, the bottom line is, if it came out, you'd buy it, right?
3910391	3911371	I would buy it, no doubt.
3911471	3912432	At least the support would be there.
3912692	3915213	Alright, we gotta move on, but thank you for calling, Zaku.
3915814	3916294	Have a good one.
3916714	3918155	I just want to make a really quick comment.
3918195	3919295	Very interesting perspective.
3919636	3920956	I want to make a really quick comment.
3921116	3926399	A lot of games in Japan never come here because people think we're not going to get it.
3926439	3928060	There's just too many cultural differences.
3928843	3957304	Look at games like Katamari Damashii I was just thinking the same thing Animal Crossing, Katamari Damashii Incredible Crisis didn't sell incredibly But it was pretty tough to find It had a following Even Bust a Move That was like right around the same time DDR first came out When the first Bust a Move game came out The first Bust a Move had been out I had the second one before the first one came out
3958880	3961022	And essentially, like, all that stuff becomes cult hits.
3961082	3964884	I mean, like, Parappa was, you know, first Japan, if I'm not mistaken, or whatever.
3964904	3973410	And then, yeah, it came out here, and it sold about, like, 30,000, 40,000 units, which, essentially, in the game industry, 25,000 is considered, like, a cult hit.
3973490	3983837	So, you know, and just like DDR, the minute you get a cult following, you know, if the game is good enough and has staying power and you have enough fans that back it, it's going to blow up eventually.
3983897	3985378	You know, it will run its course.
3986929	3990313	I mean, and it's just... That's usually how they all start.
3990333	3993657	Whenever something new comes out, it's a quote-unquote cult hit.
3994098	4001486	I mean, this is maybe... People are going to probably bash me for saying this, but first-person shooters didn't used to be the most popular game in the world.
4002087	4005932	But then ever since, you know, Doom came out, just it started going...
4006559	4007119	and so on.
4023508	4026992	I think, you know what though, Saku does bring up an interesting perspective.
4027072	4037544	I think what basically he's saying and how Mel makes the comparison where, you know, this was the same reservations that Konami had about DDR several years ago is that people wouldn't get it.
4037904	4039726	Well, they're just having those same concerns all over again.
4039767	4042109	I don't think that comes as a surprise to any of us, basically.
4043270	4047471	I think with a good marketing campaign, I think it would definitely move.
4047491	4051653	Well, I think a lot of it has to do with what is 2DX's niche, too?
4051873	4055834	Like, you know, DDR makes you lose your butt a little bit, right?
4056014	4058294	And then 2DX is just fans of music.
4058655	4062536	People who like the feeling that they're creating a song, but with no talent.
4062616	4063016	No, just kidding.
4063356	4064016	I'm just kidding.
4064456	4065096	I'm just kidding.
4065877	4070338	There's a lot of people out there who play 2DX that are extremely talented, but it's easier to make...
4071084	4072205	The music, you could say.
4072525	4076846	Playing 2DX, then actually going and producing music from the ground up.
4077287	4079728	And I get, everybody, I think, gets that feeling.
4079808	4090572	I remember the first time I ever played Hip Hop Mania, Complete Mix 1, when it first came out in America, way back in the day, and I played, you know, was it Believe Again or something like really old?
4090932	4093133	I was just like, I feel like I'm making music.
4093173	4097135	I press a key, and then I press the key again, and this turntable's cool.
4097455	4099116	You know, and I love music.
4099136	4100116	I've grown up
4100452	4103014	I've grown up loving music and I still love music.
4103034	4112881	I think a lot of, you know, obviously a lot of people love music, so I think that, you know, you just point at these things in a sales campaign or something and, you know, sell it off as music.
4112941	4129214	Well, I just kind of hope that the success of Donkey Kongo, which I believe has been a fairly successful game so far, Taiko No... I'm sorry, Taiko Drum Master, Taiko no Tachigen in Japan, a little early to tell, I think, with that one so far, if it's been successful or not, but hopefully if these games that come bundled with peripherals are somewhat successful...
4129674	4135336	Hopefully, maybe Konami will go, okay, maybe America feels a little different about peripherals now.
4135396	4139497	Because I think a long time ago it was kind of like, peripherals don't do well here.
4139618	4146260	Super Scope, Power Pad, you know, everything pretty much, Tank, U-Force, Power Glove.
4146560	4150181	How much is an official Konami dance pad right now?
4150741	4151202	Still about 50 bucks?
4151222	4152502	I don't know if you can find one.
4154238	4157759	I mean, to get an official Konami pad, you'd have to buy a bundle, usually.
4157940	4161961	I mean, if you go to, like, some, like, store like, say, Toys and Joys, yeah, you can probably get for, like, $30, $40.
4162761	4166623	But the bundle, I think they run about somewhere around $79 to $80.
4167043	4170485	I believe they are selling an Ultramix 2 bundle on Amazon right now for $59.99.
4170685	4178168	Okay, so what I'm saying is that when the Konami pads officially came out originally, they were over $50 a piece.
4179523	4183265	to import them before they came out here, they were usually like 70-something bucks a piece.
4184326	4187147	Obviously, the price has dropped, you know, substantially.
4187367	4191669	Well, Mad Catz had a lot to do with that, too, with their, you know, bargain basement dance pads.
4191689	4195671	Well, no, I'm talking about official pads that are actually quality-made pads.
4196252	4200994	And, you know, I think the same could be done with Konami controller.
4201034	4202415	I mean, ever since the 2DX...
4203331	4205392	official Konami controller, not the arcade style.
4205832	4207372	Ever since they came out, they've been around $100.
4208352	4209953	And they still are around $100.
4210693	4215614	I'm sure they could work something out, or they could drop the price a little bit for an American release.
4215894	4218155	I mean, Sony does it all the time.
4218975	4223296	Maybe Konami could outsource a company to make a quality controller.
4223936	4225157	That'd be interesting.
4225697	4229698	And take a little bit of loss for a little while until the game gets, who knows, maybe...
4230741	4231702	Sony makes peripherals.
4231742	4232542	Why can't Sony do it?
4232983	4233503	They got money.
4234564	4236845	So, in other words, Konami, if you're listening, just take a chance.
4237926	4238406	Oh, my God.
4238426	4239227	Take a chance on me.
4239247	4239807	No, stop it.
4239827	4240327	No ABBA.
4240347	4241088	Take a chance.
4241208	4242649	Is there ABBA in DDR?
4243449	4244430	Not yet.
4244590	4245691	Then don't bring it up.
4245711	4248072	Okay.
4249969	4257355	As long as ASCII does not make a 7-key one, ASCII is probably the worst 5-key controller ever made.
4257875	4260898	Wait, is that the same company that made the ASCII pad for the Super Nintendo?
4262459	4263340	Probably.
4264020	4268224	Well, that was, I think, at the time, the greatest controller ever made, so what the fuck happened to them?
4270054	4270514	Management.
4270594	4270895	I don't know.
4271115	4271475	All right.
4271515	4271795	Maybe.
4272356	4272576	All right.
4272596	4273337	We're going to go to a break.
4273357	4275598	We got some more Ultramix 2 songs we're going to play for you guys.
4276039	4279341	This next one, it's actually a really long one, so we're going to kind of shorten it a little bit.
4279421	4281022	I'm going to kind of start it here in the middle for you guys.
4281323	4282664	It's a group called Creo.
4283564	4284585	I think I pronounced that right.
4284645	4285045	Creo?
4286146	4286627	Close enough.
4286827	4287707	It's K-R-E-O.
4287767	4288148	Creo.
4288888	4290790	Or if you said it backwards, it would be Orek.
4291390	4291670	I don't know.
4291951	4294112	Anyway, the song is called Burn For You.
4294733	4296534	And this is a new song that's going to be on Ultramix 2.
4297034	4298916	And don't play this at your local clinic.
4300171	4301477	It might be a bad sign.
4368018	4369328	Thank you for watching!
4423482	4426087	Let me tell you something you don't know
4482135	4484990	Tell you something you don't know
4609410	4622501	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio Starting the Eurobeat party apparently, no, sorry about that That's what happens when I have things on repeat, it shouldn't be Initial D Initial D
4624131	4626492	We are back here on episode number 118.
4626952	4628152	What are you boys talking about over there?
4628172	4629732	What are you boys talking about back there?
4629892	4632753	Oh, we're gushing over the Rumble Roses soundtrack.
4632953	4633313	Oh, you're right.
4633333	4634293	We're talking about boobs.
4636114	4638814	Well, it's kind of relevant because the game comes out this week here, so.
4638954	4640795	I thought it just came out on like Friday or something.
4640815	4641035	Did it?
4641175	4641895	Yeah, I heard it came out.
4642275	4643035	Hmm, okay.
4643475	4645796	Well, I just know that this week I've got to go pick up a few games, so.
4647356	4648236	Am I coming through on the mic?
4648256	4649036	Do you have money for that?
4650037	4650957	Yeah, I got a little money.
4651277	4651897	Just teasing you.
4653305	4654046	Can you check the levels?
4654106	4654666	Am I coming through?
4654686	4655847	Yeah, you're coming through.
4656067	4656768	I can hear you.
4656788	4660911	That's why I have these big space-age headphones on, so I can hear if the microphones are coming through okay.
4660951	4662432	Yeah, now you look like a real DJ.
4662652	4663052	Yeah, I know.
4663672	4665313	This is the coolest system I'm ever going to get to the real thing.
4665414	4667075	I mean, you've got the headphones on.
4667915	4669776	You're not particularly attractive.
4669796	4671257	Just kidding.
4671878	4673339	I've got two turntables and a microphone.
4673599	4674039	Uh-huh.
4674360	4675480	Okay, Beck.
4675820	4677842	Where it's at, huh?
4678202	4680003	No, but... Continue.
4680564	4680924	Continue.
4681741	4682822	On to your topic, if you have one.
4682862	4684964	Well, I was going to say Rumble Roses, but that's alright.
4686065	4688206	You were talking to Mel about the voice acting, right?
4688386	4688747	Oh, yeah.
4688807	4693951	I was just asking if I ever asked him about the voice acting, if there was anything up with it.
4694131	4696793	I mentioned it last week, but I couldn't remember it quite like you can.
4697114	4697354	Okay.
4697574	4701877	Well, no, I just was explaining to him, and I'm assuming it's not the game itself.
4702418	4703859	I doubt Konami would release a game with
4704682	4711988	Seriously mismatched speech to the lip syncing, because it was like, in the videos I had, the voices were coming out of the wrong people.
4712588	4719314	So I'm assuming it was just because somebody was skipping, whoever was playing over at IGN was skipping through dialogue, and it, you know, you know how it is.
4721115	4725938	And by the way, don't blame us people over in the U.S.
4725998	4728239	for the horrible dialogue within the game.
4728279	4731161	We were only given one day to rewrite all that stuff.
4731241	4736064	So even the producer admitted as much after we did some damage control.
4736084	4737905	He said we should have been writing from the get-go.
4738786	4743408	You know what's interesting, though, is that a lot of the earlier reviews of Rumble Roses have good things to say about the music.
4743448	4744389	Very good things to say about the music.
4744509	4749172	Oh, a lot of people I've been reading the reviews have been saying it's just a good game all around.
4749915	4754078	I mean, I think, you know, the chicks thing has a big thing to do with that.
4754118	4755399	But hey, it looks like a great game.
4756320	4762425	Well, I think what Rumble Roses has best going for it is the fact that, I mean, you capture a lot of things that wrestling people like.
4762485	4771892	I mean, they like wrestling and most, um, the wrestling, they use the engine from Yuke's, which was the one that's been used for SmackDown for the past couple of seasons.
4772272	4777156	So the people who buy the game have something they're already familiar with as far as gameplay.
4777176	4779638	And then, of course, it's, you know, the
4781121	4782662	100,000 megapixels or whatever, you know.
4782942	4788226	So the characters are very detailed and, you know, they've got an engine for jiggling and all that kind of stuff.
4788686	4792248	I'm thinking, you know, so it's, I mean, what's not to like?
4792288	4792968	Visually great?
4793128	4793909	Gameplay great?
4794229	4799472	I mean, if you don't like wrestling, I mean, then... Well, wait a minute, that's the weird thing.
4799752	4802954	I don't like chicks and I don't like wrestling, yet I'm interested in this game.
4802974	4803975	Okay, wait, wait, wait.
4804375	4805696	That's because you're gay.
4808192	4813077	and... No, no, no, that's the reason why you're interested because you wish you could be as hot as these girls.
4813818	4815780	Okay, yeah, I wish I could be hot.
4815800	4816961	Anyway, no, um...
4818049	4819490	Yeah, blanket statement aside.
4819570	4825773	Anyway, here's just kind of a little joke, but on a serious note, kind of, I don't know.
4825893	4826974	Well, no, not any serious, just a joke.
4827674	4830476	Yeah, it's got the whole engine for jiggling and stuff.
4830496	4836019	You're not necessarily a boob guy, which you're weird if you aren't, but you're more an ass guy.
4836339	4838960	They got some pretty good accurate ass jiggling, too.
4839160	4842102	I would say I'm more of an ass guy, and I still don't care.
4844043	4845544	And again, you're gay.
4849209	4849790	What the hell?
4850170	4851131	What are you saying, Miklo?
4851611	4852492	You saying I'm wrong?
4852632	4853373	What am I wrong about?
4854313	4857897	Anyway, so anyway, about the voice acting, what?
4857917	4858457	Thank you, thank you.
4858477	4864382	The voice of reason, one of our females in the showroom, DDArcoholic says, when will the games with the gyrating penis come out?
4864702	4867505	I want to know when my Thunder Down Under wrestling game comes out.
4868531	4872834	If you want giant gyrating penis, that would have been in Katamari Dimash.
4872874	4874715	Yeah.
4875735	4882179	Actually, no, there's a series of games in Japan that are shooters, that all the characters... Shooter games.
4884980	4887462	Floorwalk is grabbing his testicles, he's like, oh no!
4888102	4895927	No, not that kind of shit, like a side-scrolling shooter game, that are... The characters, your ship or whatever, is like a...
4897188	4901191	I know, I said blanket statement aside, obviously I wasn't serious.
4926684	4927845	But I am with you, Miklatov.
4927966	4928907	Just kidding.
4929868	4930809	It was fun to punch you anyway.
4932411	4933712	I do not bring a Bunga Bunga.
4933732	4938378	We do not need finger to the ass action here.
4940582	4940922	Oh, man.
4940942	4942783	Okay, not that kind of ass.
4942863	4950044	Anyway, um, I just thought I'd let you know, because, you know, girls always say this, when do we get our guys, our hot guys in games?
4950424	4952745	Hot guys in games has been around since games came out.
4953385	4953705	Okay?
4954445	4961066	They've been putting artwork on old arcade games with big, muscly men, and they still put hot guys, quote-unquote, in video games nowadays.
4961086	4962307	Like, Karnov?
4962627	4962987	What's that?
4963007	4964487	Wait, what?
4964547	4966487	I can play with John Cena at home, so I'm happy.
4966668	4967588	I don't know who John Cena is.
4967628	4968608	How about this is a weird...
4969148	4971309	Hey, hey, how about this is a weird game right here.
4972289	4973570	Miniskirt Police.
4976411	4978452	Wait, did you surf for weird games like Google?
4978632	4978892	Yeah.
4980092	4980412	Okay.
4980472	4981433	Miniskirt Police.
4981713	4985654	It's a light gun game where I guess you take pictures of women in miniskirts.
4986995	4987595	Okay.
4987635	4988596	That's a Namco thing.
4988736	4989456	Go Namco.
4989636	4989976	Oh, yeah.
4990276	4991076	There's Namco for you.
4991897	4992277	Interesting.
4993657	4995858	They should have a motion capture version of that.
4996218	4997539	MoCap Miniskirt Police.
4999369	5001711	and you need a partner to play with in a miniskirt.
5002351	5003172	So it's not really a game.
5003472	5004573	It's just, yeah, anyway.
5006234	5009677	So... Hey, don't knock the Japanese games, though, because they brought us Radiant Silvergun.
5010097	5010437	Oh, yes.
5010657	5011418	Which I've got to play.
5011478	5013559	In an awesome spin-off called Ikaruga.
5014840	5019163	Yeah, but I got to play Radiant Silvergun Arcade Machine and that makes me feel special for the rest of my life.
5019944	5023927	On the now-vanished game land in Vegas.
5024522	5025363	Ooh, cool.
5026484	5027445	Radiant Silvergun is pretty.
5027625	5027865	Okay.
5029206	5030067	Go on, Rob.
5030287	5030747	Oh, hell.
5030808	5031628	Did I have another topic?
5031828	5033350	I knew I had something Ultramix 2 related.
5033370	5036372	I want to get to the cage match soon, too, but I guess we can do one more quick topic.
5036813	5042798	You know that some of the first early reviews of Ultramix 2 came out, and one of them has been making rounds on the Freak.
5043258	5045480	It's the one that was in GMR Magazine.
5046561	5049224	And apparently, they're not big fans of the game.
5050902	5054507	But man, the freak, they are tearing this guy apart.
5054567	5055909	Like, I was just reading this.
5056230	5060376	I'm looking at the thread here, page 160, I think it's 161 or 162 of the thread.
5060817	5064202	Somebody tried, like, harassing the guy on AOL and everything.
5065813	5072339	I'd say harassing, but you know, maybe borderline stalking the guy on AOL trying to say, What's wrong with you?
5072719	5074080	Fuck you, you fucking fuck!
5074621	5075281	No, I'm kidding.
5075341	5077643	It was more mature than that, but, you know, not by much.
5078404	5082287	I mean, you know, part of half of me is, you know, saying, Oh yeah, go, you know, stick up for us.
5082307	5084508	The other half is, you ain't even played the game yourself.
5084529	5085850	You know, what the hell do you know?
5086570	5090774	So, I mean, I think ultimately, you know, only God could judge us, and if he did, he'd give us an A+.
5093255	5094376	No, this is those fuckers!
5111536	5113678	Hi, this is Eris from GameStop.
5115800	5116161	Eris?
5116441	5117322	Are you dead?
5117442	5118943	Hi, this is Eris at GameStop.
5119744	5119824	Yes.
5126044	5127706	You've reserved a blank game.
5127846	5131109	And it's like, Eris is like a reference to Eris from Final Fantasy 7.
5131189	5132650	It's-a me, Mario!
5133130	5136654	I just wanted to let you know that your Sonic the Hedgehog game came in!
5137034	5137715	Mamma mia!
5137835	5145522	Even though, and people who have seen me play Final Fantasy 7 know this because I have my game saved at this one particular place.
5145962	5150265	so that I can take this shit out of Jenova again and watch Aerith die all over again.
5150305	5151986	Yes, it's a great thing to relive, right?
5152026	5154388	Oh my god, you guys, stop spoiling Final Fantasy 7.
5154428	5155789	I haven't played it yet.
5155929	5156910	She dies!
5159111	5159812	Get over it.
5159892	5160512	And I cheer.
5161113	5162193	Yeah, it's good.
5162794	5169739	The only thing, in my opinion, that can ruin Advent Children is if Aerith somehow comes back to life.
5169799	5174382	Oh my god, that would just... Okay, so, that being said,
5175060	5176441	You guys have no feelings.
5177362	5177682	Why?
5178103	5179664	Tifa is a much better woman.
5182066	5182747	She can kick ass.
5182767	5186790	I can't believe we're having this discussion, so I'm going to change the subject back to this review.
5186810	5189432	If I got a call from Eris from GameStop, I would run away.
5190153	5191814	Eris had codependency issues.
5191874	5192194	Yeah.
5195052	5195693	Oh my lord.
5197214	5201016	Well, if you want to join in the fun, they posted his AOL screen name and everything.
5201056	5211544	I just think that's kind of interesting that they got the whole little... I mean, for lack of a better term, I know it's not these same guys, but I can't help but think of the word be mafia to describe what's going on here.
5213045	5216688	I don't like using that term because I know it's not the same people, but you know what I mean.
5216728	5222512	It's still the same idea where these guys are just hounding this poor guy that was just reviewing and...
5223052	5223793	I mean, you never know.
5223813	5227197	Once a festival hits Japan, Japan critics are going to say, you know, it's not American enough.
5227237	5227337	Wow.
5241364	5247929	Good news is that some other reviews are coming out, and I think we've seen 7.5s and 8s, and average DDR scores are on the board.
5248469	5257536	I think, again, a lot of these people don't really... The folks that review hundreds and hundreds of games for the magazines and stuff, they don't have time to submerse themselves in the communities of all these games.
5258257	5261219	I don't think a lot of these folks maybe realize...
5262851	5271976	Just how different and how anticipated this game is in America just because it isn't a Japanese release, you know what I mean?
5272836	5273136	I don't know.
5273977	5274857	That's just my take on it.
5276978	5283802	It's finally like one of those games that seems to have very, very, very few ties to Japan other than the fact that, hey, the game was originally created there.
5283822	5286523	But it's like, you know, whole new interface, whole new game, whole new modes.
5286604	5289345	It's really, truly like an American production.
5290309	5296915	I think it's just kind of one of those things where it's just after time that series will have its own identity more than anything.
5296995	5304601	And that's all you can really, I mean, just I as a gamer, think originality and just like making, you know, like being a little different.
5304821	5318373	I mean, sure, you know, DDR is pretty universal as far as like within Konami itself and all, but if you got Ultramix 2 and it's like always kind of like that cutting edge type thing, it's like, well, you know, some people watch like M2, you know, as opposed to MTV or, you know, watch all those other niche shows because, you
5318868	5325464	You know, it's like, they already know they like the game, but they want to see it to its, you know, maximum potential or something different, and, you know, I mean, it's, why not?
5328035	5328656	Very interesting.
5328956	5331038	Apparently now, I'm getting a follow-up.
5331098	5338924	Apparently our old Orange Lounge Radio favorite, Al Mullet, is the one that's been doing a little bit of this AOL, harassing this guy.
5339164	5344349	Hey, he's the pusher for the cookies, so he gets the amnesty right away.
5344489	5344989	That's right.
5345249	5347451	But no, apparently he has responded.
5347772	5349013	We don't know the details yet, though.
5349033	5354597	I'm hearing this all secondhand, but maybe we'll... Keep checking the Freak for developments, because maybe something will get posted there.
5354938	5355278	Whoops.
5355871	5366696	I want my boyfriend to watch me play the game and start crying because the game makes him feel inadequate while I enthusiastically play the hell out of it.
5378390	5378910	Who said this?
5379190	5379911	DD Arcaholic.
5380311	5382752	Oh, I thought this was Rice Princess.
5382832	5383332	No, no.
5384232	5385052	That would have been funny, though.
5386133	5386753	That's great.
5388014	5389034	I'm sure she would have said it, too.
5389054	5390915	You know what, though?
5392335	5393696	That's happened.
5395576	5397877	That's all personal preference, what game makes you want to play it so much.
5398117	5404580	There's been times where Rice Princess was so hooked on the game where she would just play it all the time and we didn't really have time for much else.
5405080	5405880	That's just how it is.
5406260	5406821	You're a gamer.
5407041	5407801	You're in a relationship.
5408578	5408758	Charge!
5408778	5408898	Charge!
5433012	5439035	Last week in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, Jamie won it with a song, I guess it's some sort of parody song.
5439435	5440436	It was a little silly.
5440496	5443558	Five, four, three, one, off blast.
5443718	5450501	But it was very popular nonetheless, and it won our cage match with a sweeping victory.
5451202	5457285	It was Zlod with Electronic Supersonic, and that's the first song we're going to hear a clip of in tonight's cage match.
5458365	5459206	Now here's the thing.
5460908	5464132	Much to Loki's hatred, he does not like this song.
5464913	5468477	He's only pissed off because he's the one that usually puts the smart-ass songs in.
5469478	5472481	I'm debating whether to put a really shitty song or a really good song tonight.
5472501	5472682	Hold on.
5472702	5473422	I have to agree.
5476766	5477948	Papa Smurf was awesome.
5479096	5479976	Okay, hold on.
5480776	5494599	Way back in the day, back when you weren't in the hundreds yet in episodes, like probably not even in the 20s or something, I once, we didn't have three people for a cage match, so I once, I said, go ahead and put in one of my songs, and you're like, what is this?
5494639	5496319	God, I'm not ready for this.
5496899	5500940	And I put in an Aquabats song, which is a pretty popular Ska group.
5501300	5505661	And you said, I don't see that as a cage match song.
5506181	5511386	How is Dark Sakura's song, though it is very funny, any different than that?
5511486	5514810	It is not what you would see as a cage match song, but you didn't say anything.
5514870	5515550	Here's the thing, though.
5515570	5518653	The thing is, though, you're full of shit.
5519194	5520976	Shut up before I shove my cock in your mouth.
5520996	5521276	Shut up.
5522117	5523398	Where's my camera?
5525100	5530164	The cage match has evolved an awful lot the past, you know, 100 episodes we've been doing it.
5530865	5534548	I think it used to be the thing where it was like DDR, Guitar Freaks, 2DX songs.
5534989	5537010	Now it's kinda like cool stuff.
5537090	5538432	No, no, no, wait, wait, wait, okay, wait.
5538972	5543196	I'm totally calling bullshit because... There are still songs that I have said are not Cage Madge.
5543336	5543776	Just wait.
5544257	5552884	For about four weeks ago or five weeks ago, Matt put on a song by, um... No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
5552944	5557508	The song you put on by, um, Compufonic, uh, what's the name of the band?
5558491	5559451	Echo Image.
5560252	5561012	What's the name of that song?
5561792	5562312	Come Back.
5562853	5567234	That song is awesome, and you said, I don't see it as a cage match song.
5567334	5568054	I didn't, and I still don't.
5568074	5570795	It totally fits perfectly into the genre of music we play.
5571175	5573716	It was techno pop, or electro pop, or whatever.
5573856	5576437	I didn't, and I still don't.
5576657	5577617	Stick my foot up your ass.
5577677	5585260	What do I know, because it's the first song ever to have to be retired from the cage match, so obviously it doesn't come down to my opinion, it comes down to the opinion of the listeners.
5586178	5588040	So put that in your pipe and smoke it.
5589261	5594506	Whatever happened to the days when we used to say that we do this radio show for our amusement, not their amusement?
5595767	5597829	Well, we sold out like cheap whores.
5597869	5598530	What do you expect?
5598550	5599210	Thank you, Sal.
5599310	5599831	Thank you, Sal.
5600151	5600732	Can I have a hug?
5601993	5602734	Get away from me.
5602754	5603294	Can I have a hug?
5605096	5605556	I want a hug.
5606637	5606858	There.
5607418	5609140	We're going to put our differences aside.
5609160	5609280	Aww.
5610143	5611484	Don't try to grope me, get out of here.
5611564	5611884	Alright.
5613606	5617308	You're hugging, very provocative.
5617829	5618649	That was very erotic.
5618969	5619430	You gotta do that.
5619550	5620611	No, I'm kidding.
5620971	5621671	Alright, I'm kidding.
5621731	5623253	Why don't we make a video game out of that?
5623493	5624954	There we go.
5625654	5626875	Hug hug revolution.
5626895	5629477	There was that one game that was at the Natsume booth at E3.
5629517	5631258	Where you go around kissing people.
5631619	5632279	Yeah, Tulip.
5632539	5633480	Tulip.
5633640	5634340	Alright, anyway.
5634721	5636042	Hello, cage match, hello.
5637307	5638628	All right, we're going to get into this.
5638748	5640590	It's Electronic Supersonic.
5640810	5644974	You get to hear a clip of it because it won last week, and then you'll hear two new songs in their entirety.
5645434	5648036	And I can't wait to hear what, like you saw, has to say about my pick tonight.
5648076	5648637	He's going to love it.
5649417	5653601	Anyway... I thought we did piss Brad off on our show on here.
5653621	5654181	Sorry, sorry.
5654562	5655102	Here we go.
5655182	5656463	You can vote for this if you want.
5656523	5658225	It's a clip of song number one.
5658265	5661447	This is Zlod with Electronic Supersonic.
5661507	5661808	Enjoy.
5664341	5666783	Hey baby, wake up from your asleep.
5667163	5678852	We have arrived onto the future and the whole world is become... Electronic Supersonic Supersonic
5679930	5705878	Electronic Hey baby, ride with me away, we doesn't have much time My blue jeans is tight, so on to my love rocket climb Inside tank of fuel is not fuel, but love Above us, there is nothing above, but the stars above All systems gone, prepare for a down count 5, 4, 3, 1
5708348	5729270	Fly away in my space rocket You no need put money in my pocket The door is closed, I just lock it I put my go-plug in your socket The sun and sky is bright like fire You and me gets higher and higher
5734938	5738199	Only thing can stop us is flat tire.
5741639	5745300	Hey, love crusader, I want to be your space invader.
5745580	5748501	For you, I would descend the deepest moon crater.
5748881	5751322	I is more stronger than dark vapor.
5751542	5754202	Obey me, I is your new dictator.
5754462	5756383	For you is Venus, I am Mars.
5756683	5759423	With you, I is more richer than all the stars.
5759723	5761504	Make a wishes on a shooting stars.
5761744	5762904	Then for you, I will play on
5765956	5770118	All right, that was song number one in tonight's cage match.
5770158	5772739	Last week's winner is Zlod, Electronic Supersonic.
5784400	5785921	Wake up from your sleep.
5785961	5788683	Yeah, wake up from your sleep if you fell asleep during that.
5789163	5793966	If you haven't seen the video yet, somebody posted it on The Freak a while back.
5794006	5795367	I don't know if it got posted in our forums.
5795407	5800830	I don't think it did, but go check the random chat on The Freak and see if you can find it because it's pretty funny.
5801111	5801571	It's pretty funny.
5801911	5804893	All right, next up in the cage match, Loki's pick for this week.
5804973	5805994	Loki, what did you pick for us?
5807097	5817827	I picked Rammstein's song off their new album, it's called America, and it's a nice American hating song, and I hate America, so here we go.
5817847	5823713	Alright, here's song number two, Rammstein, and I just gotta say, now wait a minute.
5824790	5830895	See, Jamie puts in the song that I would expect Loki to put in, and now Loki is putting in the song I would expect Jamie to put in.
5830915	5831716	What is going on?
5831736	5833718	What in the hell is going on with this show?
5833938	5835740	I've played this song plenty of times on my show.
5835820	5838202	And I'm going to put in the song that nobody would put in.
5838302	5840384	So, here we go.
5840484	5843266	Song number two, Rammstein with America.
5843366	5843667	Enjoy.
5846556	5849779	We're all living in America, America
5874157	5875725	Thanks for watching!
5879304	5884525	Even if you turn around alone, let yourself be controlled a little.
5884805	5887326	I'll show you what's right.
5887366	5888206	We want to give a life.
5888246	5891167	Freedom plays on all violins.
5891187	5893187	Music comes from the White House.
5893327	5895588	And in front of Paris is Mickey Mouse.
5924991	5926893	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5963903	5970988	We're all living in America America, America We're all living in America Coca-Cola, Wanda Bra We're all living in America
5998503	6003744	I don't think my mother's gone No, this is not a love song We're all living in a mess
6046642	6047624	Thank you for watching!
6074106	6076708	All right, that was song number two in tonight's cage match.
6076768	6079931	That was Rammstein with America.
6080691	6081372	Very interesting.
6081472	6088958	And because I forgot to say it earlier, and I forgot we're going to have a lot of new listeners now with the whole DDR Freak Radio syndication, I should explain what the cage match is all about.
6088978	6090819	That's where we play three songs.
6090959	6092100	Each host picks a song.
6092200	6098806	They go head-to-head against each other, and the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio Live.
6099806	6105330	Orange Lounge Radio is the Monty Music and More program, which airs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week on Orange Lounge Radio.
6106251	6117198	Again, the cage match kind of started as songs that would be really good in DDR, 2DX, and Demonte-type games, but I think it just kind of turned into a clusterfuck of whatever's cool, as I was telling Pratt earlier.
6118179	6123223	Anyway, we're going to give our thoughts on those songs, but of course it is up to you in the end what you think.
6123663	6126245	You are the ones that have the final say, but we're going to give you a hint.
6126785	6127946	Jamie, you want to go first?
6129068	6129749	I hate that shit.
6129769	6129929	Do it.
6129949	6131571	Turn that shit off.
6149665	6151827	I'm turning the shift off.
6151928	6156172	I don't want my sticky keys to come on without, you know, actually anything being on there.
6156393	6159256	I don't want to hear about your sticky keys.
6160257	6161778	I don't get the keys sticky usually.
6162719	6162980	Anyway.
6164423	6165044	Something else.
6165364	6165944	Yeah, go ahead.
6166325	6166865	Mikey Style.
6167386	6168347	What, should I rate it?
6168507	6168707	Yes.
6169848	6175754	Definitely not one of the better Rammstein songs in my opinion, so I'm going to give it a 5.
6176334	6176675	Alright.
6177475	6179237	No, there's better songs than Dew Haas that they did.
6179837	6180098	Loki.
6181898	6205699	I liked it, it's, I have, you know, honestly, this album is not as good as the last album, the last album, every song fucking rocked, unfortunately, I don't have their last album ripped to my computer, so, I had to pick from this album, and, I like it, um, it's like this album had, like, a lot of, like, country named songs, so, I was torn between this one or Rush, uh, Moscow, so, uh, Moscow would have been pretty good.
6206385	6209907	And you don't hate Moscow nearly as much as you hate America, so you had to pick America.
6209927	6217351	Well, Moscow had a girl that sings in it, it's like Tattoo, and it's got also the... Sounds like Tattoo.
6217391	6222093	Yeah, and it also has accordion in the background that kind of goes with it.
6222133	6223514	It's weird, but it sounds good.
6224915	6225375	Clowock.
6226483	6241191	Um, I don't know, every time I hear, you know, all that kind of, you know, music, I think of, like, the German greats, you know, I think of Vanilla Ninja, I think of, uh, Falco, David Hasselhoff, you know, I mean, so, I have to, I have to accept my hierarchy.
6241231	6243372	Is Falco the guy that's, like, putting on the ritz?
6243732	6244513	No, that was Taco.
6244653	6245233	Oh, Taco.
6245253	6245934	Taco, Taco.
6253699	6262048	I have to set my hierarchy, and although that one was pretty interesting, I still think David Hasselhoff beats their ass.
6262328	6262769	I'll give it a 7.
6264491	6264831	I'll give it a 7.
6267774	6273235	I surprisingly like that song, which is rare for one of Loki's picks.
6273335	6276396	No, actually I did like that song, and I would probably give it an 8.
6276736	6279677	And going back to the cage match thing, I could see it in Guitar Freaks.
6279697	6280757	I think that would be a fun one to play.
6282918	6283298	Explicit.
6284078	6291060	Well, it's a pretty interesting song, but I've heard better songs from Rammstein, so I'm going to give it a 7 out of 10.
6291840	6292740	Alright, there you have it.
6293020	6295721	Alright, but it doesn't matter what we think, it's all up to what you guys think.
6296834	6300117	What's your favorite ODB quote?
6316500	6319324	I'm going to refrain from comments.
6319364	6319944	Be polite.
6320285	6321025	Alright, anyway.
6322527	6323048	Moving on.
6323068	6324269	He literally dropped dead.
6327381	6328802	At the age of 35 or 36.
6329102	6331464	He literally just dropped dead in the studio.
6331484	6336768	No, just like probably in a music studio, probably recording, which proves to us once again, cocaine is a hell of a drug.
6336908	6338829	You know he died with a 40 in his hand.
6340170	6343732	And still owing like six child support payments to his baby mama.
6344513	6349076	You know, he probably was dead like about 30 minutes before he actually fell to the floor.
6349096	6351558	You know, it's just the cracking and it was keeping him going.
6352294	6353874	Can I get to my song, please?
6355195	6356035	Comment, DarkSakura?
6356555	6368978	I just can't... don't feel very mournful over someone who didn't take responsibility for his children, so... I'm not the biggest fan either, but... We don't have a 40-ounce to tip in his honor, so we had to do something personal otherwise.
6369018	6369638	Urinate instead.
6370518	6370938	Anyway.
6372178	6373999	Moving on, my pick...
6374679	6375300	Whatcha Waitin' For?
6397597	6398618	Alright, and here it is.
6398858	6399298	Enjoy.
6399618	6401099	I think this song will be perfect for DDR.
6401139	6401720	You be the judge.
6401760	6402040	Here it is.
6402060	6404162	Song number three, Gwen Stefani, What You Waitin' For.
6404222	6404602	Enjoy.
6410846	6423175	What an amazing time, what a family How did the years go by, now it's only me
6462596	6463700	Thanks for watching!
6481399	6483102	Thank you for watching!
6509145	6510246	Thank you for watching!
6540927	6542470	Thank you for watching!
6566445	6577510	Watch now, you're still a supermodel female You've got your million dollar contract And they're all waiting for your luncheon What you waiting, what you waiting
6596674	6598716	I'm waiting for you.
6598977	6600898	I'm waiting for you.
6601139	6601939	I'm waiting for you.
6629447	6631908	All right, that was song number three in tonight's cage match.
6631968	6634068	Gwen Stefani, what you waiting for?
6634688	6636749	And I can tell you right now, we waiting for Jamie.
6637029	6637649	Oh, here she comes.
6638289	6640049	Jamie, I know you were gone for part of that.
6640069	6640510	What'd you think?
6641350	6642490	It's too happy.
6645711	6647331	It's a happy, too happy seven.
6647651	6649231	Yeah, it's a happy, shiny seven.
6650132	6651932	Happy, shiny seven.
6651992	6652812	All right, lanky seven.
6653852	6654993	Or is it shiny, happy seven?
6655013	6655493	There we go.
6655513	6656213	Anyway, um...
6658117	6659339	I like that song a lot.
6660260	6664264	I actually didn't hear that she was going solo until really recently, and then all of a sudden here's her song.
6664544	6668869	And I was kind of like, eh, not a big surprise the sound style she took.
6669049	6671731	It's kind of cliche, but it's still cool.
6671772	6672112	I like it.
6672252	6672753	It's dancey.
6673453	6673794	Good stuff.
6674394	6675115	On a scale of one to ten?
6675615	6676076	Oh, sorry.
6676617	6678679	I'd say probably an 8.5.
6678719	6678859	Loki!
6683378	6687422	Um, well, there's two things that that song was lacking.
6687682	6691565	Number one, well actually one thing that I didn't like about it, it was top 40.
6692205	6693947	Number two, it did not have any English in it.
6694427	6696108	There was no English in that song.
6696128	6700412	The other two songs featured English, that song had none, therefore it gets a six.
6704241	6705402	I like it.
6705682	6709705	I think it's kind of doubled on the fact that the video for it was actually very cool.
6710266	6716891	And ever since watching that video, I too would like to find a way to express how a giraffe does sound.
6717712	6723556	Because for those who haven't seen the video, she's trying to get inspiration, so she goes to some clinic or whatever.
6723836	6726058	They give her a survey, and one of the questions she has to answer is,
6726448	6729930	In your best way possible, write out what the sound of giraffe makes.
6730990	6734512	But I think it's a really bounce, definitely a pretty cool song.
6734572	6738914	It's very reminiscent of like I would say probably mid-80s production of Debbie Harry.
6739455	6744857	So I can totally get with that and this is one of those times where I do have to give out double digits, a 10 for me.
6745158	6745858	Wow.
6746718	6750240	I gotta say, you know what, that song just makes me want to shake my booty and spank yours.
6754482	6755142	Give it a five.
6755803	6756804	I give it a nine and a half.
6758024	6758505	Exquisite.
6761487	6763588	I really like the song.
6763869	6769913	I like how Gwen Stefani went to the direction that has more of like an 80s type of background.
6771274	6776798	But at the same time, I don't know, maybe I'm just not used to her music for that type of direction.
6778206	6781489	So I probably gave it a... That's a pretty good song, so I gave it an 8.5.
6781529	6786933	Might as well because of what Sky said about speaking his ass.
6786953	6788434	So 7.5 for real.
6789415	6791337	Alright, well good thing it's not up to these guys.

6852662	6855766	Loki, tell us what's going on in the sim scene this week.
6857848	6858328	Nada.
6858929	6859029	Um...
6859616	6885071	I think I mentioned it last week, it was a release candidate to Step Mania came out and other than that there's really the only thing that's worth mentioning is there's a contest, a theme contest that's going on with all the themes that have been made this year they're trying to get DDR Maniacs' theme of 2004 with many in the running like Techno Fiend which is in the lead and
6886229	6887470	Some other ones that are on there.
6888670	6889971	Yeah, Technofiend.
6891032	6895374	Anyways, Technolize, Technofiend, I can't remember what it's called.
6895794	6897315	So yeah, those are worth checking out.
6897475	6897756	I know...
6898973	6903777	Technolize is working on version 3.0, which is supposed to be completely redone.
6904557	6905578	It's still nice looking.
6907740	6911323	Other than that, really not too much going on right now.
6911823	6915946	I've been checking out this week, actually, BMS sim files.
6916827	6922251	For those who don't know what those are, those are the homemade, key-sounded Beatmania 2DX.
6923482	6924263	I will rock you
6948445	6949967	It was really cool, actually.
6950387	6950888	Very cool.
6950908	6953350	They turned it into a house song, which was pretty neat.
6954011	6962160	And then I have a remix of The Fall that's on there, and there's also Paranoia Delta, but that one's too much noise.
6963361	6965123	It's like too grungy, so...
6965803	6967064	Not worth playing on the show.
6967565	6968626	But you can find those.
6968706	6970127	There's sim files out there for them.
6970707	6983118	Also one that was pointed out that I found would be Cigaru 180, which was by this... The only Russian Bimani remixer that I've seen.
6984279	6985319	It's actually pretty cool.
6985600	6986801	We might be able to play that later.
6988082	6990003	But those are pretty much... That's all that's really going on.
6991425	6991965	How long is it?
6992005	6993006	It's only like a minute fifty, right?
6994411	6994591	All right.
7010446	7021228	Again, if you enjoy Bomani remixes, then might I urge you to tune in to Diversion, the Orange Launch Radio remix show, which airs every Monday night at 7 o'clock Pacific Standard Time on our station.
7021768	7022228	Check it out.
7022768	7028369	And, of course, this week will be the first question in that show for the Akira Yamaoka signed CD contest.
7028389	7032530	If you're just joining us, check out our website, www.orangenlaunchradio.com, for all the details.
7032630	7033130	Okay, here it is.
7034410	7035751	Loki's going to spin this for us.
7036191	7037211	What's this remix called again?
7037271	7037371	It's...
7038891	7042654	It's Cigaroo180, and the guy that remixed it's name is Vospy.
7043334	7047417	And he's got his own site, I really have to search hard to find it.
7047477	7053481	He's a member on DDRUK, he does a lot of stuff with the Pump It Up scene over there, I guess.
7053981	7058704	But, yeah, Cigaroo180, and it's only about a little over two minutes.
7058904	7059385	So, here we go.
7059405	7061146	Alright, check this out.
7132342	7134349	Thank you for watching!
7184574	7184954	Is that it?
7185094	7185875	Wow, alright, that's it.
7185895	7186996	That was pretty neat.
7187016	7187517	That was pretty cool.
7187617	7188998	Where can people get a copy of that if they want?
7190259	7198766	Um, but my style in their sim file section is like, you can just do a search for Cigarro180 and you can find that sim file for it, which isn't that bad actually, I played it last night.
7199267	7201929	Just, I'm out of practice and my hand cramped up pretty quick.
7203590	7203871	Alright.
7204491	7210136	So, I missed me and your, uh, getting, you know, some action then, because you haven't been, uh, taking care of yourself.
7211147	7214228	If your hand, you're not... My wrist is fine, it's my hand that's not.
7214628	7216408	He said his wrist is fine, it's his hand that's not.
7217228	7217528	Anyway.
7217588	7218108	I see.
7219569	7222649	Alright, let's get to the winner of tonight's cage match, shall we?
7222669	7224629	We took some votes while that song was on.
7224669	7226030	You guys ready to hear tonight's winner?
7226450	7227490	What do you guys think won?
7228110	7228690	I always pull.
7228890	7230531	I would say the third song definitely won.
7231311	7233891	Well, let's see if it was a shocker tonight.
7234551	7237032	Tonight's winner was not a shocker.
7237052	7238092	Alright.
7241280	7242120	It was close, though.
7242160	7246822	The votes were very... ...the worst piece of shit I can find next week.
7247763	7249463	Hey, sing the song.
7249483	7252104	And I remind you, you just had a song retired.
7252164	7256546	It's time to let Jamie and I bounce some back and forth for a little while, so... Alright.
7258183	7260465	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7287223	7291726	It's Guitar Freaks and Dromania V. V standing for Vest.
7292226	7293787	That still doesn't make any sense, though.
7294307	7298689	But what the theme is going to be for this release is going to be gears and machinery.
7298769	7301350	So you're going to see some pretty kick-ass interfaces, at least.
7302031	7303872	They're revamping, I guess, the result screen.
7303892	7305933	It's supposed to be more 3D or something like that.
7306233	7307474	God knows what they're going to do with that.
7307874	7314897	The movies that are going to be playing during it, it's going to be something similar to 2DX, where you're going to see full motion video and stuff like that.
7314937	7315958	That means a hardware upgrade.
7316403	7318204	It's going to be a hardware upgrade, yes.
7318264	7321846	It's going to be just like 2DX, 10th Style, and Red.
7321866	7326148	It's going to be right off of a PC-like hardware system.
7326628	7331810	The other thing that they were saying it was supposed to be in there is about 230 songs starting, I think.
7332351	7336553	And that's not including, I think, the unlocks from, you know, obviously the emu stuff.
7337913	7345937	Other than that, really not much else other than they mentioned a few songs for test locations.
7345997	7348178	I know that were on there and some licensed stuff.
7349758	7353260	One song that's being pointed out in our chat room specifically by DarkLionXVI says...
7353996	7356497	Mysterilou, which was the theme from Pulp Fiction.
7375988	7377991	Actually, I think I know who this is that's calling.
7378051	7378972	Actually, hold on, let me take this.
7379572	7380714	Keep telling us about Guitar Restart Mania.
7381835	7384057	Why don't we have a cage match one week with ringtones?
7385078	7387982	Anyways, this is a game where you play the guitar and beat the drums.
7390472	7391333	So, how's that?
7391353	7396496	I was going to look on the list here and see what we've got for Guitar Freaks.
7397417	7399038	Some new Dezbro songs.
7399098	7401660	We've got Endless Cruising, which sounds pretty cool.
7401720	7402861	Mushroom Boy by Pooh.
7403502	7404362	Everyone loves Pooh.
7405063	7406904	And Going Up by Colors.
7407545	7411127	I just want to say it's awesome that there's a band called Pooh in Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania.
7411948	7413109	What song are you going to play?
7413469	7413889	Pooh?
7415504	7432396	And as we were mentioning before, Mizorilou or whatever that is Mizorilou is Spaghetti Surfers Wild Challenger by Jindo NGS by Asian Kung Fu Generation Nocturne No.
7432416	7433777	9 sounds like, you know, No.
7433797	7443443	9 But by some Japanese group here And the extra stage will be Heaven's Cocktail By Big Five
7445689	7449692	and... Heaven's Cocktail.
7450292	7452514	Did you get one of those cool little umbrella things with it too?
7454516	7454896	Maybe.
7455696	7457978	But anyway, so yeah, that's kind of what's going on.
7458999	7464863	Link to the Konami test page or whatever on OrangeLawsRadio.com.
7465714	7468576	So if you can read Japanese, you'll definitely get a kick out of this site.
7468897	7471099	Also, pictures are on the page.
7471779	7472280	Oh, okay, cool.
7472400	7474361	I also can't remember if we linked to this or not.
7474482	7476463	I actually don't think I ran a story on it.
7476483	7477544	I'm going to have to tomorrow.
7478225	7482488	I did pick wind, though, that Konami is doing another survey.
7482969	7484210	Remember how they did a big survey?
7484230	7486832	They were putting their feelers out there for a 2DX7 style?
7487172	7492317	Well, this time the game they're taking surveys for, Karaoke Revolution, Bamani Edition.
7494402	7500157	In Japan, they are putting out the feelers right now for a karaoke revolution edition with all Bomani songs in it.
7500919	7502282	Wouldn't that be something else?
7502728	7505829	It'd just be like watching DDR3rd Mix all over again.
7505870	7507350	Seriously, that's basically what it is.
7508351	7509491	More info on that to follow.
7509531	7511132	We don't know a whole lot about that right now.
7511192	7514314	All we know is that I think they were looking for 3,000, which isn't a very big number.
7514774	7518836	So, it looks like that'll probably happen, the Karaoke Revolution Bomani Edition.
7519216	7521257	And for some people, it'll finally be an excuse for them to play.
7521557	7526900	And maybe those kids that were trying to get Murmur Twins in Karaoke Revolution will finally get their way.
7528680	7531182	Which would be very interesting, I think, if Murmur Twins made it in there.
7531202	7531922	We'll have to see.
7534351	7535731	They need to put this in here.
7535751	7538352	What was that?
7540092	7541732	Naha and Gachikun.
7542192	7545853	That'd be great.
7548153	7550254	Yeah, so there's not too much going on.
7550594	7555795	We're still waiting to hear more about Dancing Stage Fusion, the arcade mix, because that's going to be the huge news to come out.
7556275	7560696	Because, you know, if Europe's doing it, then, well, guess what?
7560736	7563256	The hardware's done, so all they've got to do is make the game.
7564221	7566742	or another game for another region, you know, Japan.
7567302	7576065	I'm surprised that we're not seeing a new arcade mix for Japan, because, I mean, it's not that hard to make it once the hardware's done or whatever, but, you know, hey, whatever.
7577485	7578465	So, it'll be interesting.
7578985	7589609	At least, maybe we'll see some arcades import that over here, because they'll get desperate and not wanting to wait any longer and not wanting to buy in the groove, so, yeah.
7589629	7590549	More than desperate to lose an XP+,
7593184	7594867	is saying something about DanceHouse Extreme Plus.
7594887	7596049	That's really in town now?
7596450	7597231	Yes, it's CCL.
7597331	7597892	Oh, God.
7599054	7607277	Yeah, DDR Extreme Plus, or the so-called Knicks that they claim is new, it's actually on CCL, Country Club Lanes.
7607337	7610058	Interesting, our local bowling alley, where DDR was born here in Sacramento.
7610358	7610878	Very interesting.
7611378	7612518	I kind of want to check that out.
7612758	7618020	You know what's very cool about Country Club Lanes here in Sacramento, our bowling alley where DDR was born here in this area?
7618980	7622481	It's 24 hours, which makes it very cool for DDR, because it's open 24 hours.
7622882	7625362	Yeah, but there still is a night you have to pay the cover charge to get in.
7625422	7627343	That's very true, that's very true, and that sucks.
7629494	7635839	I remember, I mean, back in the day, we used to hang out, like, till midnight and go play DDR till 3 in the morning.
7637560	7639241	I remember the days of glow bowling.
7639802	7641843	I remember the days when we would go... We need to do that.
7641883	7643204	We seriously need to go glow bowling.
7643244	7647748	Remember back in the day, right when Rocky Horror first died and the sacramentals were coming together?
7647868	7650129	I remember you, you and me, and Mel and Melody all went.
7650650	7652371	Yes, I do remember that quite vividly.
7652411	7655834	And we were like, duh, tired.
7656775	7660840	I remember going and we'd go and then we'd play DDR and that was back when they still had, I think, a 1.5 mix.
7660880	7665344	I seem to recall that... I remember being assaulted on the 1.5 machine.
7665605	7665885	Yeah.
7666145	7666646	Oh, that's fun.
7667247	7667587	Good time.
7667627	7670410	I think when we went it was actually up to a fifth mix at the time.
7670630	7670871	Yeah.
7671151	7671231	Ugh.
7672156	7673657	I believe in good service, thank you.
7700543	7702024	Good memories there.
7702364	7704445	Any location that has 24-hour DDR is fun.
7704505	7708126	Any place now is completely at my mercy now that I've got my business law book.
7710307	7714989	Because now I could have sued them for not fulfilling their duty of utmost care.
7718010	7718630	Don't mess with her.
7718650	7719651	She's got a law book now.
7720271	7720571	Damn.
7721653	7727074	So very interesting, though, going back to the fact that Dancing Stage Fusion is going to be having a brand new cabinet coming out.
7727794	7729555	Could be very good sign for DDR.
7729635	7730775	Could be just a red herring.
7730815	7731155	Who knows?
7731395	7732095	Well, you never know.
7732155	7733735	I mean, also, you've got to think of it like this.
7734776	7741977	When they did DDR Extreme, they even mentioned as much, like in concert, I believe, they said they had to take a break from DDR because, you know, for whatever reason.
7742057	7746518	And it was at the point where they had created a DDR mix like once a year, practically, and
7747249	7751473	I think we got like 4th and 5th mix in the same year.
7751854	7754717	Oh yeah, you had 4th and then you had 4th Plus come out and then 5th.
7754737	7755958	Yeah, that's right.
7756018	7759381	It was like 4th, 4th Plus, and then like 5th and Max came out in the same year, I think.
7759561	7763025	Yeah, so I think it was long overdue, at least just for a little time off.
7763065	7767669	So it wouldn't surprise me the least bit to see a new DDR come out.
7767929	7768210	I mean...
7769131	7770213	Yeah, that's just how it works.
7779409	7792134	Seeing how 2DX and Guitar Freaks Drum Mania have been cranking out babies and all that kind of stuff I think it's a good thing that Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania is getting an overhaul though Because honestly, it was getting to a point when they got, like what are they on, like 11th mix now?
7792695	7802239	I just, yeah, it's been the same damn game since 5th mix, just with different songs It's kind of got to the point where it's like, oh, Guitar Freaks is getting a new mix, oh, you know, must be Monday You know, it's like
7803635	7803795	DDR1?
7803835	7804175	Oh, DDR Hawaii?
7804195	7804456	Well, usually...
7831216	7845800	Usually, I'm not sure about arcade mixes, because as far as, I mean, as far as, like, say, home console versions, like KSET, I believe, does, like, there's actually, the AM division is different than the console division.
7846240	7853001	So, I mean, as far as, like, programming, all that kind of stuff, Hawaii doesn't really have that much say, I don't think, as far as arcade releases.
7853061	7855662	As far as, like, home version, of course, they got the lockdown on that.
7856728	7857128	Interesting.
7857528	7859369	Well, it'll be interesting to see what happens.
7859769	7870072	Because a lot of people, just with the developments with Ultramix 2 and the license, they said, you know, I've heard people say this, if DDR comes out again in the USA, Hawaii needs to be involved.
7870452	7871492	Hawaii definitely needs to be involved.
7871652	7873953	Which is amazing, considering that Ultramix 2 hasn't even come out yet.
7874573	7875513	But, we'll see.
7876573	7879694	Yeah, it's, I mean, there's a lot of things going into Ultramix 2 that are different.
7879794	7882835	You know, obviously, some people give Hawaii credit for
7883382	7885263	And of course going kind of a slightly different direction.
7885864	7894409	Some people can point out to the fact that this time they got even more DDR knowledgeable people to QA and not only that work on step data.
7894429	7901434	So this is very much like fans having even more, or like players having more of a say into what goes into a game.
7902808	7911256	If that's the direction how DDR as far as the Ultra Mix franchise is concerned, then it's definitely going to have its own identity very shortly.
7911737	7913459	People will see that as soon as they get it.
7915609	7916030	Very good.
7916270	7916530	All right.
7917571	7918252	I guess we're going to do now.
7918272	7919373	I think now is a good time to take a break.
7919473	7922095	And when we come back, we're going to get into the FUs of the week.
7922155	7928080	So if you want to send some FUs in over private message to Sky in the chat room, we will make sure we get those read on air for you.
7928461	7934086	We're going to continue to play some full-length versions that we found on the Internet of brand-new Ultramix 2 songs.
7934126	7935427	And this one should take you back.
7935767	7938350	This is one I did not recognize until I actually listened to it.
7938390	7939511	I did not recognize it by the name.
7939531	7940592	But then when I started listening to it, I'm like...
7941092	7942214	Oh my god, this song!
7942714	7945458	This is Don't Stop by the Freestylers.
7946400	7946860	Enjoy this.
7946880	7948082	This is going to be an ultra mix too.
7948102	7948382	Enjoy.
7948403	7948903	We'll be back.

8257802	8258683	The occasional marathon.
8258804	8259825	I do marathon stuff.
8260065	8260426	That's right.
8261268	8263169	Didn't you marathon at ESR the other day?
8263209	8269092	No, last week I did the Strong Bad Things again.
8269272	8269552	Oh, yes.
8270573	8271673	I actually tuned in for part of that.
8271693	8272253	I heard some of that.
8272273	8272854	It was pretty good.
8273454	8273814	Good stuff.
8274274	8280858	And then Wednesday night's going to be now, not going to be the Orange Lounge Radio Rewind anymore since those are moving over to the Freak.
8281458	8288901	It's going to be the classic, moldy episodes, freshly fermented for your listening pleasure, year-old episodes of Orange Lounge Radio.
8290343	8293422	and Thursday nights on this station outside the box.
8294656	8298777	My program dedicated to all that other random video game stuff.
8298837	8300597	So definitely check it out if you haven't yet.
8301537	8304918	Now we must get to one of those Orange Lounge Radio Live staples.
8305518	8308499	That thing we have to do every week where we get out that angst.
8308599	8314020	And for those of you guys that are new to this program, I know there might be some of you guys that are listening to this on DDR3 Radio for the first time.
8314420	8317701	Those of you guys that are new to the program are going to hear this every week.
8318361	8319321	The FUs of the week.
8319401	8323022	And Jamie, why is it that we have to do these FUs of the week every single week?
8323882	8326104	Because we're not going to take it anymore.
8341749	8345370	The first F you goes to my allergies for flaring up.
8346350	8348851	The second goes to Benadryl for making me sleepy.
8349951	8352492	Also, for some reason, my jaw hurts.
8353072	8354572	Like, the joints in my jaws.
8356072	8358553	Yeah, I've got all this sinus pressure in my head.
8359153	8361153	That means that I'm likely going to bed early.
8362834	8365474	I don't drink tariff, nor do I have any at the house.
8365714	8367575	I have prescription drugs that are doing shit.
8368935	8369015	Oof.
8372276	8374117	But I'm probably going to be going to sleep early tonight.
8374377	8381058	A big F you toward having to work on this ethics project.
8385799	8388119	F you to the sneezes that don't happen.
8391660	8393060	F you to stupid people in traffic.
8394100	8397661	F you to the doctor who put my arm in a cast.
8398321	8400241	I cut that shit off of branch cutters.
8401997	8402978	My hand still hurts.
8403298	8409665	Yeah, another F you to my cat, Shermie, for being in a big feeding frenzy so that I'd trip over her while wearing socks in the kitchen.
8410726	8411306	Last Sunday.
8412528	8417472	Just, in general, just massive F yous to just about everything.
8419595	8420876	I think that will cover everything.
8421517	8421837	Alright.
8422818	8423779	Loki, your turn.
8427678	8428559	Oh, my God.
8428619	8432024	You know, as if I don't complain about them enough.
8433783	8434103	Yay!
8434143	8435844	You did it again, Comcast!
8435864	8438945	You just find a way to fuck everything up again!
8439426	8440546	Way to go, G4!
8440706	8441487	Because you know what?
8441527	8448250	There wasn't quite enough crap on there yet, so you had to get rid of the, like, good stuff, you know, to fit more crap in there.
8448850	8457094	I'm sorry for all those people that used to be part of TechTV that got sucked into G4 and then fired, because you're talented.
8457814	8458634	Well, you know what?
8458914	8461255	They don't want to make G4 look bad, so guess what?
8461315	8462015	Bye-bye!
8462475	8463855	Bye-bye, screensavers!
8463915	8464876	Bye-bye, Unscrewed!
8464916	8467916	Yeah, screensavers will still be there, but it ain't screensavers anymore.
8468796	8469536	And, you know what?
8469837	8471197	I'm... And you know what sucks, too?
8471237	8476578	Is I heard that the people... Actually, some of the good shows on G4, like Cheat and stuff... Oh, those guys got fired, too!
8477198	8477938	So, guess what?
8478258	8480599	You know, the hell with all the good stuff on G4!
8480779	8485880	I will not be watching G4 anymore unless to catch the last episode of Unscrewed, if they ever air it...
8486460	8490323	Thank you Loki for destroying any possible opportunity we ever had of taking Orange Lounge TV on the air.
8490343	8490643	Thank you.
8518211	8518552	Listen.
8520775	8527586	Listen, I'm not going to want to be associated with anything on that station because, uh, you know, it just does not have enough halo in that show.
8528328	8529469	So, um, no.
8529570	8531052	Anyways, um, so fuck them.
8531553	8532454	And, um, fuck...
8533214	8536515	My headache, because it sucks, but it's starting to go away, so that's kind of good.
8537535	8539516	Fuck Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.
8539996	8543677	And more specifically, the Woozimo mission.
8543817	8544997	I can't fucking beat it!
8545377	8545998	It's annoying!
8546318	8552399	Why does anyone... Okay, why do street racers, Japanese street racers, come to town to have an off-road street race?
8553140	8557221	I'm sorry, but, you know, people that drive, you know, those racers, don't drive off-road, okay?
8557281	8561622	The racers were not made for off-road, so... Why do they have a race that goes off-road?
8561642	8561962	That sucks.
8563127	8569112	And, um, finally... Fuck you again, the G4, because you suck!
8569733	8570333	I hate you!
8570834	8572635	I hate you, I hate you, I hate you!
8573556	8580142	That's it.
8583044	8584966	I just want to give a special message to Comcast.
8584986	8585266	You know what?
8585286	8590270	Despite what Loki says, I will still sell out faster than Divine Brown, okay?
8590450	8591171	I just want you to know...
8593143	8594743	and I have this great concept.
8595003	8598184	I have this wonderful concept for a gay gaming show.
8598204	8599605	We could call it Gamers.
8599725	8600245	Think about it.
8601105	8601605	Think about it.
8602165	8602605	You want me.
8602645	8603146	You know you do.
8604766	8605686	I would take Jamie with me.
8605746	8607347	Loki gets left behind, though, after that remark.
8607707	8609387	Does that mean that you have to have the hag co-host?
8609427	8611088	Yes, you would be my official fag hag co-host.
8611228	8612888	Cool.
8614088	8614388	All right.
8615509	8619270	And Loki can polish my shoes for all I care.
8619290	8619610	All right.
8620723	8622444	Anyway, on to my FUs, my actual FUs of the week.
8622464	8624126	You can be the angry hetero guy in the corner.
8624246	8625367	Yeah.
8625447	8640479	My FUs go to being sick, because I've been very sick all weekend, and it sucks, because remember I was sitting here last week, and I took a poll how many people were sick, and half the people were sick, and I said, gee, the rest of us feel like we just got a death sentence, like we're waiting to get sick.
8640779	8641580	Sure enough, I got sick.
8641900	8646364	It wasn't quite as bad, like I think the strain kind of got weaker as it went along, so I can't bitch too much.
8646824	8648185	But being sick still sucks.
8648305	8649985	I just want to get that out there.
8650246	8653527	But what I really want to say on FU2 is FU to those guys on Halo 2.
8653907	8654667	Oh my god!
8655028	8657309	I got invited into this match on Xbox Live.
8657929	8660610	One of my friends, somebody on my friends list on Xbox.
8660850	8664051	You know how like the people on your friends list, you sometimes don't know them that well?
8664472	8665672	Well, I had one of these guys.
8666172	8669114	Then he invited me into his game and he had like all these experts in there.
8669154	8671175	And I guess they were having tryouts for their clan.
8671975	8674236	And for some reason they wanted me to try out for their clan.
8676129	8682050	Well, like, we were playing one of those team games that was King of the Hill, and I'd never played that version before, so I didn't know what I was doing.
8682290	8685391	And my teammates were yelling at me, and they were like, Don't you know what you're doing?
8685631	8688011	Come on, Green Sky, what the hell's wrong with you?
8688791	8690352	And I'm just like, I wanted to cry.
8690532	8692852	Like, I was just like, they're yelling at me, and they're being mean to me.
8693332	8694012	I don't know what I'm doing.
8694052	8694933	Fuck your clan!
8695573	8697633	You guys are the Ku Klux Klan right now!
8697653	8698633	That's what you guys are!
8698993	8699313	Rob.
8699653	8699933	What?
8699973	8702414	You need to join the clan that Dan's in, the fuckers.
8703772	8704793	Okay, I'll join that.
8705273	8707275	Are they going to yell at me if I screw up?
8707475	8708135	Probably not.
8708336	8709657	Probably half of them will be drunk.
8711998	8718403	After that match, though, Flairone, one of our listeners, invited me into one of his matches, and I blew him up a bunch with a rocket, and that made me feel better.
8718483	8720505	So thank you, Flairone, for letting me take my aggressions out on you.
8721906	8722346	That's it.
8722827	8727851	F you to assholes on Halo 2, and F you to people on Xbox Live that when you sign on to the game, they go...
8730097	8731658	Yeah, because they think it makes them look cool.
8732398	8733639	FYI, it doesn't.
8733779	8734219	Grow up.
8734500	8734900	Thank you.
8737421	8741924	Moving on, let's see what our other guests in the studio have to say, starting with Floatwalk.
8750729	8751869	Oh, sorry, we can't hear you.
8751889	8752310	Turn on the mic.
8753297	8754117	Oh damn, I had no idea.
8754137	8754917	Sorry about that.
8755157	8767440	Okay, well, it's a pretty tame week of FU's for me, although part of one right now I'm just thinking more than anything is FU to Konami Digital Entertainment America QA department.
8768200	8772641	Thanks for laying me off a lot earlier before the game even passed, you know.
8773121	8777142	I mean, I'll probably get help for even saying it, but there are some things you don't do.
8777202	8782183	You don't spit in the wind, you don't tug on Superman's cape, and you don't break up a team before the game goes gold.
8783860	8784921	I'll leave it at that.
8785121	8790005	And I think Mr. Miklatov can totally get me off, can back me up on that one.
8790425	8793788	So, yes, I'll leave it very short like that before I really go off.
8795049	8799132	Well, I think we'll just move right along to Exquisite.
8801714	8802995	One of the biggest FUs.
8803015	8804636	Okay, six inches from now.
8804716	8805097	All right.
8806178	8806658	Try again.
8806978	8807779	Okay, okay.
8807859	8808559	Is this better right here?
8808579	8809260	Yes, much better.
8810951	8816117	Alright, I'd like to say a big F you to some old guy who rear-ended my fucking car!
8819541	8820262	Oh wow!
8821003	8822144	You rear-ended my car!
8822525	8823526	What the hell?
8826195	8827036	Jamie's trying to nap.
8827616	8829837	You gotta turn it down a notch, that's alright.
8829877	8837962	I'm sorry for being so loud, but I was just very pissed off with the fuckin' old fart who fuckin' really entered my car, and it was his fault for moving back.
8838022	8841524	I moved out first, so it gives me priority to go first.
8842965	8846427	And the fact he just went, like, around 20 miles an hour backing up?
8848648	8851150	Just cause you drive an SUV does not mean shit.
8852113	8859155	There was no scratches in your car, yet you left a big ass dent in my Toyota Corolla 2004 S Silver.
8859195	8862216	Now it looks all ugly as hell and I have to pay 200 bucks.
8863336	8868657	Now I have to pay 200 bucks off my own money just to get that shit fixed.
8870078	8877760	And just cause you said, oh, I'm sorry, and run away like it's a hidden run with a bunch of cops around doesn't mean I'm gonna...
8878790	8885937	I'm on your ass whenever I see you!
8889500	8894444	Okay, enough with the FUs with the car, because I'll pay that shit up in a few weeks and stuff.
8895365	8899569	Okay, another FU goes to people playing Halo 2 multiplayer.
8900389	8900750	Hey!
8901690	8904773	No, certain people, certain people.
8906614	8906975	All right.
8907375	8909676	Just because you're touching my balls doesn't mean I'm distracted.
8909696	8911657	Wow, wow, what, what, what?
8911717	8914299	Wait, wait, I didn't realize this was a feature in Halo 2.
8915479	8918101	Wait, whoa, wait a minute, wait a minute.
8919462	8921583	Yeah, we see people try to cheat in Halo 2.
8922283	8923824	So you know what people do in Halo 2?
8924925	8926705	Like, if you have to put people around, like, what?
8927986	8928126	Sorry.
8928146	8928246	Oh.
8932262	8934603	Sorry, sorry, we're doing something else over here.
8934643	8935623	Funny picture on a website.
8935943	8936744	Ooh, interesting.
8937084	8940185	But yeah, F you to people who are trying to cheat in Halo 2.
8940865	8943446	Yeah, punching people in the face.
8943606	8944767	Just try to win a game.
8945107	8946307	It's just a DM game, yo.
8946327	8949048	If you get your ass kicked, just take the heat.
8949649	8956091	There's no need to touch people, just touch people, touch people in the balls for a subsexual desire that you guys have.
8956791	8958052	And no, I'm not like that, so.
8958852	8959852	If it was a female, that'd be cool.
8962003	8978623	Okay, well, speaking of females, I'd like to say another F you to this one stripper who fucking knee dropped my... Yeah, she, yeah, during, uh, during Gold Club 34, I paid 20 bucks for, uh, for a few lap dances.
8979223	8981746	It was discounted too, by the way, so I get four.
8984864	8992718	Yeah, well, it was a cool rap test and all, but the fact that she acted like a knee drop, like, oops!
8995524	9002147	This is what you get when we're looking at funny pictures of Sephiroth killing Aerith.
9002867	9004608	We're going to put it up on the TV so you guys can see it.
9004668	9005588	I just posted it in the chat room.
9005949	9009550	Somebody made a signature on the G4 Tech TV forum.
9009950	9020715	It's Sephiroth, and he has a G4 logo where his face should be, and there's an Aerith with a Tech TV logo where her face should be, and it's the scene where Sephiroth is about to kill her.
9022546	9032554	Yeah, I think the only thing about the stripper kneeing you in the like gonads for the lapdance, I think she noticed that, you know, if you're trying to get lapdances on a discount, she's gonna be a little miffed too, man.
9033935	9034155	Alright.
9034735	9037597	Well, I gotta bend the nuts from the situation.
9038238	9039459	Alright, it's a three hour show.
9039479	9040279	Can I move on now?
9042861	9046264	Well, it's a fact that she has a male name.
9046284	9047225	Her name's Bradley...
9049485	9054929	DJ Tyrant says, F you to school, not enough time in the day, not having a car license and life going a little too fast for me, I don't want to grow up P.S.
9054949	9056891	Tell Mel B I said, I heart him
9075169	9077571	Aw, I heart the tyrants too.
9078272	9081594	Aw, I know you're trying to suck up to me because you won't pass into E3 next year.
9081634	9083316	Don't worry, I got you covered like a Jimmy hat.
9083596	9084416	Fucking fanboys.
9086918	9087339	Just kidding.
9088720	9093383	Actually, if Mel can get me into E3 again, I'll be all up on him just like a fanboy.
9094704	9097407	Not like up on him, but you know.
9098257	9106460	I know, kind of like when you call me a brother, you know, not the way like we mean in a biological sense, but the way black people talk to each other.
9109661	9115723	Anyway, DarkLionXVI says, F you to annoying tourists who keep on bugging players just for them to look stupid.
9116303	9123486	Last night at the Adventure Dome, I had to move a black guy off the Player 2 DER pad because he was distracting a friend of mine while playing The Legend of Max's Extra Stage.
9124046	9127707	F you to myself for going to a debut party last week, ending up doing nothing at all.
9130515	9135680	Legend of Zaku says, F you to my little brother for running up almost $30 in overages at the wireless bill this month.
9136180	9143567	F you to Leisure Time Bowling Alley and Port Authority Bus Terminal in New York City for being assholes by trashing their in the groove for a second extreme machine.
9146269	9147730	Yay, score one for the good guys.
9147750	9152975	Dark Tetsuya says, F you to, surprise, surprise, Comcast for taking a giant crap on G4 Tech TV.
9155728	9161432	DD Arcaholic says, F you to people who think that they're hot guys in video games.
9161792	9165114	I may not play a lot of video games myself, but I'm pretty sure there are no hot guys in them.
9165174	9167676	Big ol' sweaty rowdy roadie Piper is not a hot guy.
9168276	9178843	He does not make me moist with his chest pounding, nor does his ugly Cro-Magnum man head or his butt crack, which is pinched shut due to the vice grip power of his gluteus maxi, make my nipples hard.
9179464	9181505	Antonio Banderas is a hot, hot guy.
9181545	9182746	He is not in video games.
9182826	9183427	No, Montier.
9184435	9196424	and FU if you think that complaining about the lack of hot guys in the media is a sad pursuit because your continuous excitement of bouncing boobies is itself a sad pursuit.
9196504	9197825	So there, suck my titty.
9199486	9199927	Holla.
9201468	9201808	Wow.
9203209	9209294	Iguana Girl says, a lovely FU to idiots who think they can talk their way out of warning points for flame baits.
9213390	9214230	They're coming to get you.
9215331	9215751	Failed.
9217872	9223675	Dark Knight has won FU tonight, and that's to torment I'm going to be facing at work here from on out.
9224116	9227337	Note, I work for a retail store, need I say more.
9228178	9233820	He works at a retail store, therefore this is not going to be a happy, fun time of year for him.
9234221	9238483	MPQ says FU to Halo 2 for making it almost impossible to get an Xbox.
9240635	9245097	and Misty says, fuck me for sleeping until 6 central and having to get to work at 5.
9245417	9247597	I doubt I'll be getting any sleep tonight.
9249418	9250979	That's it for our chatroom FUs.
9252059	9252559	Woo!
9253219	9253700	Alright.
9254780	9257441	Very colorful FUs from all you guys.
9257481	9257761	Thank you.
9258979	9260540	All right, all right.
9260600	9262421	What we're going to do now is we're going to go to break.
9263101	9267263	In this break, we're going to hear another brand new long version of an Ultramix 2 song.
9267703	9270945	I think this time we're going to do a group that's already been announced, actually.
9271405	9276668	You already kind of knew they were in Ultramix 2 with a song called C Squared because it was on the VRare.
9276688	9282130	But they have another song in DDR Ultramix as well that was announced on the website, and it's called Mellow.
9282210	9283951	And the group is Alien No. 613.
9286354	9286554	and so on.
9308376	9311819	Miklatov says, F you to Halo 2 for not saving my damn progress.
9312339	9314221	Now I have to play this fucking level again.
9314401	9315342	Boo on you, Halo 2.
9316203	9319525	F you to people who don't realize Drawn Together is one of the hottest shows ever.
9320186	9325851	It sounds like a horrible idea for a show, and it is, but it's the best thing on Comedy Central since Strangers with Candy.
9325971	9326912	I love you, Xander.
9339153	9339513	Alright.
9342456	9346160	Sorry, Mikotov, I just, your window for some reason didn't show up as red.
9346580	9349403	It's because you were sending me other messages earlier, that's why.
9349883	9351385	Anyway, let's get to the break.
9351625	9356549	Alright, as I promised, Alien number 613 and the song is called Mellow.
9356870	9357090	Enjoy.
9571104	9571524	Hello?
9572325	9573325	Hello, is this thing on?
9573385	9573905	Testing.
9575086	9575966	Testing, one, two.
9576527	9580488	I'm looking in the index, but I don't see anything for how to run a radio show.
9580589	9581049	Hello?
9581729	9583190	I don't understand this.
9583210	9584530	Does this thing work?
9584570	9586191	This thing reads like stereo instructions.
9586271	9586892	Is this on?
9586912	9587472	What the hell?
9590033	9591474	Orange Lounge Radio.
9591634	9593815	Broke Down Ghetto Bomani Radio.
9593895	9594035	What?
9596178	9596659	Ask Orange Lounge
9613186	9613586	There you go.
9614187	9621095	And also, we'll open up the Skype line for you guys if you have anything you want to comment on over the Skype line because I know we haven't gotten to talk to all you guys yet tonight.
9621575	9626761	Again, if you want more information on the Skype line, visit www.orangelongeradio.com and click on Interact With Us.
9626841	9627302	Yes, Loki?
9628063	9633208	I would like to take this moment to talk about the wonderful show called Drawn Together.
9634341	9636662	I watched today the first two episodes twice.
9637322	9642563	And I have to say, it's the fucking, it is on par, if not better, than The Family Guy.
9642663	9644304	And that was way up there.
9645144	9646144	Okay, hold on, we're getting a call.
9646184	9647624	Hi, you're on Orange Lawn Radio.
9650865	9651145	Hi.
9651425	9653266	Hello.
9653346	9656147	Turn down the speaker volume in your house.
9656907	9657227	Hello?
9657767	9659768	Hi, we can barely hear you, but we can hear ourselves.
9659868	9660688	Echoing, turn down your...
9661761	9666545	I was wondering if you could get Pop Music 5 into rotation I like the music in Pop Music 5 I didn't hear any
9689602	9699391	I'm not sure the exact titles, I think Tempura Brothers, Siciliana, they're Japanese titles, but it's in there somewhere.
9700051	9700812	You know what I'll do?
9701032	9708439	I will have our resident poppin' music whore, Navi, take a look at the soundtrack and tell me what I need to add, and we'll put some tracks in rotation, just for you, my friend.
9709279	9710541	Thanks, that's cool.
9710861	9711421	No problem.
9711461	9712522	Anything else you want to comment on?
9713903	9714404	Not really.
9714464	9716506	Are you liking the Bomani Music and More program otherwise?
9717170	9718371	Yeah, I like Bomani music.
9739278	9744380	Shit, if you want to talk about a game that hasn't changed since day one, poppin' music, holy crap!
9745020	9746521	Why is that game so popular?
9746541	9747521	That's what I want to know.
9748101	9749062	Ah, buttons!
9749462	9750442	I hit the buttons!
9750742	9751342	Fun!
9751683	9752663	Japanese music!
9752723	9753263	Cool!
9753283	9756985	I mean, it's just, no, that game does not appeal to me at all.
9757065	9760026	It's like 2DX for retards, I mean.
9760846	9761886	It's just the big buttons.
9761966	9765888	But, you know, hey, I guess there's a demographic out there for, you know, retarded 2DX players, so...
9766488	9771192	Hey, if you want to play, it's like playing 2DX with boxing gloves, you know, if you want to do that, so be it.
9771472	9777757	I mean, it's cool, it's cool because it gets crazy and stuff, but, you know, they just really haven't changed anything with that game.
9777797	9778778	They have not changed much.
9779819	9789747	But here I am, the uninformed pop music person, because I don't play pop music, and I tried playing pop music and it just did not appeal to me, but for some reason I'm still putting pop music in my cabinet, so...
9790928	9792289	I'm giving another go later.
9793349	9794630	You take the good, you take the bad.
9794810	9795411	Yeah, whatever.
9795951	9796251	Anyway.
9796811	9799493	You take them both and there you have the facts alive.
9799773	9800873	The facts alive.
9801074	9805036	Whatever happened to that Simphile contest we were going to do like a while back on the show?
9805616	9812900	Remember we were going to have the Orange Lounge Radio response to Simphile contest and we were going to have the all TV show Simphile theme?
9817526	9818066	Yeah, I know.
9818827	9819728	They can do turn-a-mix.
9819848	9823730	Shit, I mean, we could give away signed Ikiriyamaoka CDs, for God's sakes.
9823770	9824691	People would enter for that.
9825111	9826552	The DVDs in my room.
9826692	9828494	I know, seriously, we need to have more contests.
9830295	9834157	I still have like 30 Max 2 viewers at my place if anyone wants them.
9836199	9838060	Let's just start giving away like candy, hey.
9838380	9842423	Dude, that's like all we do at like DDR sponsored tournaments.
9843244	9845205	It's where it's all about speed loud.
9845885	9846265	There you go.
9847386	9847806	All right.
9849327	9850687	We'll be a walking boot.
9852748	9857190	All right, let's get into a favorite segment here on this program, which we haven't done in quite some time.
9857410	9858811	Are you sticking with us for a walk?
9859211	9861152	Yeah, what the hell, I'll stay here until the end.
9861312	9863033	All right, that's a real trooper there.
9863133	9866354	Yeah, you know, hell, sleep's overrated, I guess.
9866454	9867034	Yeah, that's right.
9867074	9867815	All right, here we go.
9867835	9869435	Yeah, that's only 15 more minutes.
9876192	9879133	Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.
9879633	9882834	What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?
9883254	9892317	Since it's been a few weeks, since we've had a segment, I expect there to be lots of questions or else... Alright.
9896238	9897058	Here's a real winner.
9897258	9899199	This question's from Legend of Zaku.
9901024	9901845	I love this question.
9901865	9905007	This is why I miss the Ask Orange Lounge segment.
9905647	9911310	Because remember, you can ask us about Bomani, you can ask us about whatever the hell you want, and this definitely falls into the latter.
9912791	9921677	Legend of Zaku says, Being a person of Hispanic descent, how come white girls like and have a thing for Hispanic guys?
9923612	9926413	Dude, ask Eddie Guerrero from the WWE.
9926474	9929015	It's all about Latino Heat!
9929215	9932116	Jamie just burst into the room from where she was.
9932136	9933457	This is all of us do.
9934097	9939660	Hey man, you want to see my Aztec Warrior?
9939680	9941141	Gotta love next Friday.
9950071	9953233	That has to be one of the most retarded questions I've ever heard in my life.
9953253	9955675	That is so generalized.
9956896	9968304	I personally... Maybe in his neck of the woods, but... In general, I'm sorry, no offense, I mean, I've dated a few Hispanic guys, but most in general, I've not had very good experiences with.
9971212	9972755	I have a lot of friends.
9973496	9980089	I've dated a few guys, but in general, I haven't had a very good experience in a romantic relationship with Hispanic men.
9981335	9982836	I dated a Hispanic guy once.
9983456	9984397	It was a nice date.
9984437	9986778	Son of a bitch never called me back, but it was a nice date.
9988039	9999165	And I think probably the fact that I have a Hispanic last name, you know, I too wonder why all the white chicks dig me too.
9999525	10002646	I can't answer this question without sounding like a racist.
10003467	10005108	Let's move on to the second question then.
10008138	10009519	Um, let's see, Jazz.
10010020	10011021	Well, this is a good question.
10011081	10013103	Have any of you guys played Technic Beat?
10013543	10014765	And if so, what do you think of it?
10014805	10023934	This is a brand new game that came out from, I believe, Namco did it, and it's another one of their bargain basement games, like Katamari Damashii, and I've heard a lot of great things about it, but I've been too ghetto poor to pay it.
10024115	10025716	I've seen pictures...
10026577	10027598	But I haven't played it.
10027879	10030541	I've seen pictures, it looks interesting, but I haven't played it.
10030762	10032503	I've heard very, very good things about it.
10032524	10034546	Isn't it something about like Ripples or something?
10034566	10039050	Yeah, it's on my to-do list because it is, you know, we want to cover all the popular music.
10039070	10041473	We still need to get the game where you do the alien that annoys people.
10041593	10045337	I know, the Under the Skin.
10045597	10046178	Under the Skin.
10046198	10047579	But that has nothing to do with Technic Beat.
10047840	10048060	I know.
10048080	10049001	Quick change in the subject, Tommy.
10050737	10053218	Alright, but yeah, Technic Beat, I'm looking forward to it.
10053258	10054358	I've heard a lot of great things about it.
10054398	10056299	Unfortunately, I have not had a chance to play it yet.
10056359	10059660	I haven't seen it anywhere, strangely enough.
10059720	10061701	I didn't even realize it was out until I went onto a website.
10061721	10063782	I was looking for Under the Skin the last time I was at the mall.
10064642	10064982	Nothing.
10066103	10066383	Alright.
10068157	10068637	Technic Beat.
10068938	10070459	We will check it out as soon as we can.
10070679	10072840	Don't we still need to get Karaoke Revolution 3?
10073080	10073621	Yes, we do.
10073661	10076463	Thank you for reminding me.
10076623	10082026	I want to invite Iguana Girl back on the show so we can do our duet to Love Shack live on air on Karaoke Revolution 3.
10082127	10083988	I hope she'll be down for it.
10085249	10086790	And then we're going to make you sing.
10087370	10088751	So very ronery.
10091233	10091573	All right.
10094219	10099002	DD Archaholic says, when you guys are not playing Bomani games, what other toys do you like?
10101304	10105427	Mine come from a store called Goldies, which is located on 16th, never mind, I'm kidding.
10106787	10111571	I don't know, I don't have any toys in the living room that might be playing video or anything like that.
10113192	10114092	I have my computer.
10115313	10118875	I have my computer, my turntables, my cabinet, my game systems.
10121497	10122778	My portal to hell device.
10123280	10125526	I don't need toys, I have a man I can climb all over.
10130154	10132514	That has been a journey into the TMI zone.
10133135	10133995	What about you, FlowWalk?
10134015	10136195	What do you do when you're not playing Mamani?
10136975	10138756	Besides recovering from eye strain afterwards.
10139156	10140116	What other toys?
10140596	10141616	Well, gosh.
10142416	10142996	Let's see.
10143196	10150438	I got my... I play with poker chips all the time because obviously I play a bunch of Hold'em on the side and stuff like that.
10151098	10153798	I got my car, which is, you know, still my toy.
10153858	10154938	I still think of it that way.
10155038	10156599	I mean, you would too if you won it.
10157639	10157779	And...
10158863	10159724	and, of course, Yu-Gi-Oh!
10159764	10162226	cards, which I toss around nowadays.
10163007	10164048	That's really about it.
10164188	10166290	I'm kind of outgoing to toy things.
10166511	10168192	Except I still play with bobbleheads.
10168212	10170915	Do you miss Kyle Snyder as a worthy opponent at Yu-Gi-Oh?
10171303	10194163	Oh my god totally where else would you get like a totally great duel along with color commentary on the side I mean it's like straight up walking to like the cartoon and it is it's you are not playing Yu-Gi-Oh you are like you're in the mini production of a movie it's like you can make a music video out of just us two going at it it is so awesome I would have loved to have seen a Yu-Gi-Oh Tatooine video
10196845	10198446	I don't have anything, I already talked about my toys
10221752	10223173	All right.
10223213	10225835	We have another question for Ask Orange Lounge from Chance.
10226095	10230638	And Chance is asking, when are you going to update the chat server info on the website?
10230758	10231138	Zing!
10231578	10232479	I didn't know it was wrong.
10232819	10233920	I actually did not know it was wrong.
10234700	10235521	I will look into that.
10235561	10236941	Thank you for bringing that to my attention.
10237642	10237962	Yikes!
10239223	10240143	I thought it worked just fine.
10240183	10241544	I've still been using the Java chat.
10241804	10242585	Maybe you know what it is.
10242805	10245847	I think it's because one of the other side IRC things went down.
10246507	10247308	I will look into that.
10249062	10249502	My bad.
10251643	10258364	And Jazz, okay, his second question to us is, why are boobs?
10263706	10264486	That's the question.
10264546	10265346	Why are boobs?
10265546	10266966	Spelled B-E-W-B-S.
10267046	10267387	Boobs.
10268267	10268707	Boobs.
10269547	10269967	Boobs.
10270787	10271688	Why are boobs?
10273568	10274168	Why not?
10276489	10276829	Lovely.
10280114	10282376	Because if milk came out their ass, that'd be weird.
10282396	10288560	I mean, they're what make the world go around.
10288860	10289680	I mean, think about it.
10289700	10291542	When you were a kid and you were crying, what did mom do?
10291882	10293223	She shoved one of them in your mouth.
10293883	10298006	Women out there, just understand, if you ever want to make us shut up, shove one in our mouth, man.
10300608	10302089	Wow, okay.
10304410	10304650	Women.
10304690	10304890	Boo.
10305010	10305551	What, Jamie?
10312119	10320791	I don't know how far I want to go with this question because I don't know if I want to bring up politics on this program.
10320811	10324215	If you want to argue politics, go to random chat on DDR Freak.
10324235	10325477	There's tons of politics threads there.
10327287	10329348	Who did you vote for on election day?
10332049	10334070	Honestly, if you listen to the show enough, you know.
10334250	10336131	You know that Jamie voted for Bill the Cat.
10336191	10337992	You know that I voted for Carrie.
10338712	10341553	All the candidates were pieces of flaming shit.
10342094	10343194	And not flaming in a good way.
10343214	10346316	I mean flaming as in on fire so they're extra stinky.
10347316	10357324	So, you know, if I voted, it would probably have been like I would have voted for Kerry, but the election machine would have seen that I was actually intoxicated or out of my mind and would have voted Bush for me, so...
10358072	10360473	Now, let me take a poll here.
10360573	10362153	Who did vote on election day?
10362313	10363774	No matter who you voted for, you did vote.
10363794	10364774	I didn't!
10364794	10366415	Looks like me and TripleExplicit did.
10366555	10370236	Everybody here but Loki went and voted on election day, so that's something.
10370296	10374497	I mean, usually on a typical election year, there wouldn't be this many people voting.
10374737	10377118	So, I think that says enough right there.
10377158	10378559	At least, you know, everybody voted.
10378619	10381319	Well, you know, a lot more people than usual voted, which is good.
10381339	10383060	And my take on voting has always been...
10383769	10387192	If you're gonna, like, complain about stuff, at least be proactive one way or another.
10387212	10388152	It doesn't matter how you vote.
10388192	10390594	As long as you do it, hey, you know, you have a say.
10390914	10395437	That's why sometimes people say, oh, yeah, man, I hate what's going on, all this kind of stuff, but I'm not gonna vote.
10395678	10397399	But how the fuck are you gonna, you know, change things?
10398099	10399841	You know, I mean, I don't care how you vote.
10399881	10401742	I mean, not everyone's gonna see eye to eye.
10401802	10406966	If you think the government should always be one certain party or the other, I mean, you're no different than Osama.
10407006	10409968	You know, if you think the government should be run one way only, then...
10410410	10412151	Yeah, you know, that's not a cool thing.
10412251	10415633	I think, yeah, you gotta mix it up once in a while, and that's why we have different parties.
10415713	10419155	And for those, I mean, I know Jamie goes off about, like, there's more than two parties.
10419635	10425018	I think what people aren't getting is, it's like, you can't make change from the top down.
10425058	10426339	You kinda gotta start from the bottom up.
10426399	10432182	I mean, if an independent party can't, like, win, like, a senator job sometimes, I mean, how the hell is it gonna be president?
10432763	10433563	You know, it's just...
10434364	10441168	I don't say it can't happen or shouldn't happen, but I think they've just got to aim a little smaller first before they, you know, go for the big prize.
10441608	10447552	I still am for disabling the electoral college and getting rid of the party system altogether.
10448272	10453595	I am all for, and you might hear me complain about this later, I am all for disabling electronic voting.
10454155	10456016	Paperless voting is very bad.
10456036	10456937	Everyone votes on paper.
10456997	10458838	Yes, I totally agree with that.
10460290	10462013	Okay, it's Ask Orange Lounge.
10462033	10470105	We got on elect... Electronic voting offers more of a chance that the vote is either not going to be counted, altered.
10470125	10472609	It has a lot more inconsistency.
10472930	10475374	That's why voting... I did a write-in absentee.
10477037	10484745	Even though at the polls they had the floating and hanging Chad problem this year just like they did back last election, so why?
10484865	10489349	Well, I think the way they need to do it is, honestly, I love the way they do it in Sacramento County.
10489610	10491812	You have a mix of electronic and paper.
10491872	10497778	You fill in the bubble and then you scan it, and that way you scan it, and if there's a dispute with the way they're scanned, you have a paper trail.
10498178	10499840	I think it's the perfect way to do it, personally.
10499860	10500060	Absolutely.
10500467	10502909	Oh, okay, I thought you meant, like, okay, never mind.
10504110	10508654	Yeah, I'm totally fine with Scantron voting, I just do not like electronic voting with no paper trail.
10508814	10512657	And for all those kids out there, you know what's really fun to do, a Scantron test?
10513157	10518922	There's this little bubble in the top of the test marquee, and if you scan that in, guess what?
10519242	10520223	You're the answers!
10522123	10524785	It really fucks up all the tests.
10524905	10530049	Anyway, off the politics subject, I want to wrap up the last few questions here so we can close this segment.
10533331	10534832	Dark Knight has a weird one here.
10535513	10537514	This might be a sad question, but this is all I have.
10537614	10541797	Which trading card game slash cartoon crossover is the worst?
10542776	10544117	That's if you've seen any of them.
10544157	10545137	If you don't want to answer, don't.
10545717	10546738	All of them.
10547518	10548839	All of them suck.
10549519	10550480	All of them, says Loki.
10550700	10551740	All of them suck.
10552420	10552921	I don't know.
10553001	10553861	Kind of hard to say.
10553901	10562405	I mean, everyone, I mean, I'm personally not even that big a fan of Pokemon, really, but I think it's funny because, no, I mean, it's kind of cool, but, I mean, if I had to pick one, but...
10562805	10582856	Funny thing, because I think of, like, cartoons and crossovers into TCGs, I heard a rumor from, like, Upper Deck, who does, like, the Marvel Versus series, like, soon they're supposed to be releasing one with, like, the Justice League, so you could have, like, Superman, Batman, the Wonder Twins and all that stuff, versus, like, Brainiac, Mitzelplick and all that, I mean, would that not be just the coolest idea ever?
10582896	10584237	That would be a cool video game.
10584357	10585177	Card game, no.
10586098	10586198	Eh.
10588099	10588859	Of course, man.
10589059	10590700	And Aquaman ain't gonna drown in no tub.
10592919	10593580	All right, all right.
10593680	10594080	One more.
10594120	10595361	Duel Masters is pretty ass.
10595701	10597283	One more question here, then we've got to wrap it up.
10597323	10599524	Last question from... Duel Masters suck.
10601886	10603848	Oh, last question from DarkTetsuya.
10604368	10607851	He sent me a song to put in Cage Match this week, and he says, you didn't use my song.
10607931	10609612	Is it because I put it in the wrong format?
10609973	10611934	No, it's just because I really wanted to put that other song in.
10612334	10613475	Your song is in my queue.
10613595	10614396	It'll come up eventually.
10614416	10614756	Don't worry.
10615177	10615297	So...
10616129	10616629	No worries.
10617369	10622211	If you have suggestions, you can always send us an email, one of the hosts an email, and we'll get your song and cage match if we like it.
10622491	10624452	And I do like his picks, so I'll get in there eventually.
10624472	10626633	Nobody except Spammer sends me an email.
10627813	10628213	All right.
10628594	10629854	We've got to wrap up the show, guys.
10629914	10631235	It's about time for the show to end.
10631595	10633375	Sad, cry, sniff, sniff.
10634796	10636496	How was my leg?
10636657	10641318	We're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts, starting with LankyStyle, who's been absent for the past hour.
10641758	10643139	He's been on my cell phone, ringing up my bill.
10644379	10645420	Use that as a name.
10645440	10646080	Yeah, it is fine.
10646101	10647021	That's a nice idea.
10647562	10648042	Please do.
10649483	10651184	Are we getting my final thought?
10651204	10651844	Yes, your final thought.
10651985	10653045	It's all Greek to me.
10654246	10655527	BroWalk, your final thought.
10655587	10657528	Thanks for being here again, by the way, bud.
10657728	10658289	Not a problem.
10659990	10667195	I just want to say, go out there, support Ultramix 2, and support Orange Lounge, support all of B-Money, because, hey, man,
10668342	10673604	You guys are like our Wonderbra, you are the wind beneath our wings, you are all that and a bucket of wings and etc.
10673644	10673984	etc.
10674024	10674945	and I shall cut myself off.
10675605	10677726	Coca-Cola, Wonderbra.
10680267	10681507	Explicit, your final thought.
10682047	10684208	Time to purchase WWX, Rumble Roses.
10684868	10685288	Yeah.
10685569	10687689	Yeah, yeah.
10687729	10688750	Loki, your final thought.
10690230	10692291	My headache's gone, that makes me happy.
10695012	10696193	My final thought is...
10698624	10698904	Hi.
10700085	10700425	That's it.
10700725	10701466	I have nothing else to say.
10702386	10703267	Jamie, your final thoughts?
10704167	10706768	I have to drive home in a freaking Benadryl coma.
10708289	10709270	Damnation.
10709850	10712011	I have to drive through the boring part of Haiti to get home.
10714993	10716113	And Mel has love for Didi.
10716153	10717234	Oh, freak, I hear you, Jess.
10717254	10719355	Don't worry, it wasn't intentional.
10719835	10720155	Jeez.
10720956	10722337	And I have to drive with a broken car.
10724006	10725888	We've given DDR Freak tons of plugs tonight.
10726228	10728190	Well, of course, the whole syndication thing helps.
10728490	10730032	Yeah, it's cool.
10730092	10731853	I mean, it's pretty dope.
10731873	10735196	We're starting to come together as one big Bimani bunch.
10735316	10735657	It's great.
10735677	10736918	Fucking Katamari, that's what it is.
10738195	10744519	Yeah, you know what, this DDR thing is going to die soon anyway, so we better all be prepared to be Katamari Damacy Radio and Katamari Damacy Freak.
10744540	10746401	No, we're all getting Katamari together, man.
10747061	10751265	You see, we built it up big enough to take DDR Freak, which is like the biggest of all of us.
10751725	10755528	You started with Orange Lounge, then you rolled up DDR, and now you're going to roll them up.
10755548	10756549	Yeah, seriously, seriously.
10756909	10763314	Orange Lounge has to roll up like all the other little Bumani sites before it can really take on Freak, okay?
10764495	10765356	No, I'm kidding.
10765596	10771859	To answer in the chat room, as I am feeling very, very ill right now, I may or may not be online when I get home.
10772100	10774021	I'm probably going to go right to bed, but we'll see.
10774481	10785307	It's all about Orange Lounge Town in the brand new, coming to the DS, Animal Crossing.
10785827	10786508	Bingo!
10786528	10790130	That's right, our free DS is going to be at my house soon.
10791334	10792856	I want a free DS, what the hell?
10793277	10794759	What is with you people and your hookups?
10794779	10804254	You're a free DS, you're a free Konami I'll feel good to have known that I earned my DS Out of two days of hard work
10805458	10807319	Way to put down everybody else, LankyStyle.
10807559	10811740	I think Dan earned his by having managed a GameStop for us on this one.
10812620	10813221	Alright, alright.
10813621	10814741	Final word of the show.
10815481	10818603	LankyStyle, I'm going to give you tonight's final word, Mr. LankyStyle.
10818703	10819703	One word to sum it all up.
10820043	10820923	One word to sum it all up.
10821303	10822344	MGS3, biatch!
10824345	10829226	That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.
10830026	10834188	Orange Lounge Radio Live is an Orange Lounge Radio production.
10834915	10847045	For more information about our station, visit our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.
10848326	10857354	Well, it's the holiday season and Santa is checking his list to see who is naughty or nice and I'm kind of feeling guilty, so I wrote a song.
10860963	10881456	So many presents, so little time Santa won't be coming by my house this year Cause I tried to drown my sister and I pierced my ear
10883221	10894546	Oh, Mama made it perfectly clear Santa don't like bad boys Especially Jewish ones!
10896499	10906785	Gnip Gnop and Lego blocks are what I desire So why'd I have to set the pizza guy's hair on fire?
10907805	10913848	I told him I was sorry, I'm a liar So no toys for me
10917104	10918645	I don't deserve them.
10919025	10923568	I couldn't wait for a big wheel as the holiday neared.
10923588	10928031	But then I told my grandma that she had a beard.
10929311	10933454	Dear Santa, I know what my problem is.
10934715	10935696	Why I can't be good.
10936556	10937717	It's a fear of intimacy.
10938958	10942300	You see, my whole life, whenever I've met someone really great like you and
10942984	10945305	I keep feeling I'm getting too close to them.
10945385	10947625	Something inside me makes me want to screw it up.
10948265	10953747	So in a weird way, the reason I'm so bad is because I love you so much, Santa.
10954967	10959028	Rock'em, sock'em, robot is what I was hoping for.
10959848	10964169	But then I made a death threat to Vice President Gore.
10964930	10970591	Oh, Santa won't be knocking on my door, cause he's a big, fat whore.
10973024	10979228	What made me say that shoots and letters would be so good indeed?
10979888	10983931	So why'd I have to sell that copper bag of weed?
10983951	10989474	So Santa, please give me my easy bake oven.
10990235	10994998	I swear I thought silly ghosts were made for lovin'.
10997759	11002002	So Santa, won't you accept my apologies?
11007295	11011960	Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
