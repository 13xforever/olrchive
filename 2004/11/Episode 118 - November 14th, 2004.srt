[SPEAKER_18]: Orange Lounge may contain plenty of... Just kidding.

8
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:22,969
[SPEAKER_23]: Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that in this episode.

9
00:01:23,269 --> 00:01:24,910
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, isn't that special?

[SPEAKER_23]: And this is episode number 118 for this podcast.

00:01:56,769 --> 00:01:58,330
[SPEAKER_23]: I hate my allergies and want them to die.

14
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:20,316
[SPEAKER_23]: Fair enough.

15
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:28,058
[SPEAKER_23]: Also joining us tonight, the other awesome co-hosts we have here are Techmaster Loki, I'm Rowling.

16
00:02:30,345 --> 00:02:43,731
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, if you want to know why our webcam isn't up yet and why we don't have the DarkSakura in our chatroom yet over at OrangeHunter.com, that's because we're having an emergency Katamari Damacy marathon.

17
00:02:44,251 --> 00:02:46,272
[SPEAKER_23]: Maybe Jamie will tell us about why we have to do that in a little bit.

18
00:02:46,292 --> 00:02:47,892
[SPEAKER_23]: But I do want to introduce our other guests for tonight.

19
00:02:47,912 --> 00:02:51,014
[SPEAKER_23]: We have a very special guest joining us for the second week in a row.

20
00:02:51,034 --> 00:02:51,974
[SPEAKER_23]: A lovely surprise.

21
00:02:52,014 --> 00:02:52,814
[SPEAKER_23]: He's in town tonight.

22
00:02:52,854 --> 00:02:53,755
[SPEAKER_23]: Say hello to Floatwalk.

23
00:02:54,835 --> 00:02:55,856
[SPEAKER_23]: Personal record for me.

24
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:57,377
[SPEAKER_23]: That's right, two in a row.

25
00:02:58,037 --> 00:03:00,598
[SPEAKER_23]: If you made it next week, you'd have tic-tac-toe.

26
00:03:01,179 --> 00:03:03,280
[SPEAKER_23]: Wow, and three is a magic number.

27
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,220
[SPEAKER_23]: It sure is.

28
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:08,482
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright, so, Jamie, really fast before we go to the opening break here.

29
00:03:09,323 --> 00:03:12,965
[SPEAKER_23]: Why is Loki having to play Katamari Damacy right now?

30
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:13,505
[SPEAKER_15]: It's so big!

31
00:03:16,163 --> 00:03:25,446
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, um, because I can only get up to, as any, I've only done the level twice, 256 meters on the Make the Moon level.

32
00:03:25,866 --> 00:03:28,227
[SPEAKER_26]: And he's got this up to 744.

33
00:03:28,267 --> 00:03:29,007
[SPEAKER_26]: This is awesome.

34
00:03:29,427 --> 00:03:29,767
[SPEAKER_23]: Wow.

35
00:03:29,947 --> 00:03:30,647
[SPEAKER_26]: It's so big.

36
00:03:32,568 --> 00:03:35,289
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, so that's the only time Lokis are going to hear that in his life.

37
00:03:35,429 --> 00:03:35,789
[SPEAKER_23]: That's right.

38
00:03:37,512 --> 00:03:42,118
[SPEAKER_23]: All right, we're going to wrap up Katamari Dimash and put on the webcam and all that stuff.

39
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:45,742
[SPEAKER_23]: So visit OrangeLoungeRadio.com, our website, for all the webcam details and stuff.

40
00:03:46,122 --> 00:03:49,266
[SPEAKER_23]: Tonight we have a lot of special stuff for you during the music break.

41
00:03:49,727 --> 00:03:52,770
[SPEAKER_23]: The Ultramix 2 website went up earlier this week.

42
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:55,073
[SPEAKER_23]: We're going to be talking about that in a little while, but because of that...

43
00:03:55,794 --> 00:03:57,715
[SPEAKER_23]: We got a lot of spoiled songs.

44
00:03:57,815 --> 00:03:59,695
[SPEAKER_21]: Yay, spoilers, my favorite.

45
00:04:00,035 --> 00:04:03,016
[SPEAKER_21]: Wow, just take the fun away from us Vivids while we still have them.

46
00:04:04,236 --> 00:04:09,397
[SPEAKER_21]: You know what, you guys quit like three weeks ago, so as far as I'm concerned, you're done.

47
00:04:09,437 --> 00:04:10,278
[SPEAKER_23]: We're done with you.

48
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:11,358
[SPEAKER_23]: No, I'm kidding.

49
00:04:11,398 --> 00:04:11,998
[SPEAKER_23]: I see how it is.

50
00:04:12,198 --> 00:04:13,118
[SPEAKER_23]: No, we're kidding.

51
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:15,379
[SPEAKER_23]: We definitely want to get the gossip from you later.

52
00:04:16,414 --> 00:04:29,543
[SPEAKER_23]: But as long as we have the songs, because we have a whole lot of songs, we just, we went out there on the internet and everywhere we looked, we lifted up tables and dusted under them and we looked everywhere for as many of these songs as we could find for you guys to play.

53
00:04:29,563 --> 00:04:31,385
[SPEAKER_23]: So we're going to play them for you tonight.

54
00:04:31,445 --> 00:04:33,746
[SPEAKER_23]: We couldn't find everything, but we found a lot.

55
00:04:33,766 --> 00:04:35,788
[SPEAKER_23]: So we're going to play them for you, starting with this.

56
00:04:36,604 --> 00:04:39,486
[SPEAKER_23]: It's a brand new licensed song from Ultramix 2.

57
00:04:40,746 --> 00:04:46,649
[SPEAKER_23]: The artist is Lava, kind of like the soap, but with an extra A. And the song is called Wherever You Are.

58
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:50,711
[SPEAKER_23]: And actually, this is not the first time we've played this on Orange Lounge Radio.

59
00:04:51,212 --> 00:04:51,572
[SPEAKER_13]: Really?

60
00:04:51,652 --> 00:04:54,013
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, I'm going to talk about why when we come back after this.

61
00:04:54,073 --> 00:04:54,633
[SPEAKER_23]: So enjoy this.

62
00:04:54,653 --> 00:04:56,975
[SPEAKER_23]: This is Lava with Wherever You Are from Ultramix 2.

63
00:06:25,604 --> 00:06:27,059
Thank you for watching!

64
00:07:02,158 --> 00:07:16,803
How I miss you so much I feel love in your eyes And I feel love when I'm with you I feel love in your eyes Wherever you may be

65
00:08:39,406 --> 00:08:40,387
[SPEAKER_23]: Gaming Radio.

66
00:08:40,607 --> 00:08:45,591
[SPEAKER_23]: So uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

67
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:49,414
[SPEAKER_18]: Orange Lounge Radio.

68
00:08:52,517 --> 00:08:54,679
[SPEAKER_23]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

69
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,122
[SPEAKER_23]: Turn off that Katamari game already.

70
00:08:59,883 --> 00:09:01,685
[SPEAKER_23]: That's so last month.

71
00:09:02,827 --> 00:09:03,667
[SPEAKER_23]: Get into now!

72
00:09:04,468 --> 00:09:05,348
[SPEAKER_23]: No, I know, I'm kidding.

73
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:12,072
[SPEAKER_23]: But you... Now, apparently, Floatwalk was impressed because Loki knew about a hidden game during the credits.

74
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:14,913
[SPEAKER_23]: Tell us about what's going on there.

75
00:09:14,933 --> 00:09:17,194
[SPEAKER_23]: Because I, unfortunately, did not really get into Katamari.

76
00:09:17,214 --> 00:09:20,116
[SPEAKER_23]: I got to, like, the second stage, and then suddenly got sucked into the other game.

77
00:09:20,136 --> 00:09:26,839
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, apparently, at the end, like, you see the credits roll, and you have a song, and you see, like, you know, your little guy running around with the ball.

78
00:09:27,179 --> 00:09:28,700
[SPEAKER_21]: You can actually move the analog sticks around.

79
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,201
[SPEAKER_21]: You can pick up countries.

80
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:57,414
[SPEAKER_21]: and so like you see like a list of countries like you know you see I picked up Korea picked up you know Vietnam all stuff I'm sitting here thinking wow I haven't seen so many like of those country names since like Animaniacs when uh what was it Yakko did United States, Canada, Mexico, Panama, Haiti, Jamaica, Peru you know I just wanted you to sing that song on air because that made me giggle during the break all right uh well good so we we we made the moon for Jamie good

81
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:03,123
[SPEAKER_23]: Now she can't say that we don't do things for her on this show because we make the moon for her.

82
00:10:03,243 --> 00:10:04,925
[SPEAKER_21]: We gave her the moon, the stars, and the sky.

83
00:10:04,945 --> 00:10:05,685
[SPEAKER_21]: We swear.

84
00:10:05,725 --> 00:10:06,306
[SPEAKER_23]: That's right.

85
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:11,130
[SPEAKER_23]: Failed.

86
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:11,931
[SPEAKER_23]: Boo!

87
00:10:13,492 --> 00:10:14,233
[SPEAKER_23]: I had to go there.

88
00:10:14,453 --> 00:10:16,154
[SPEAKER_23]: If that was a thread, I would lock it.

89
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:18,917
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright.

90
00:10:19,597 --> 00:10:19,677
[SPEAKER_23]: Um...

91
00:10:21,926 --> 00:10:24,710
[SPEAKER_23]: Jamie's in the potty right now, so we can't do how was your week, how was your day.

92
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:30,639
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, she's on her way out, but I'll take a minute to do some announcements.

93
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,162
[SPEAKER_23]: By the way, folks, this is very interesting.

94
00:10:33,202 --> 00:10:38,050
[SPEAKER_23]: Here in the Orange Lounge Radio studio, the bathroom door, the lock is broken.

95
00:10:38,476 --> 00:10:40,037
[SPEAKER_21]: I was wondering what the hell was up with that.

96
00:10:40,238 --> 00:10:44,721
[SPEAKER_23]: At any time, somebody could barge in there while you're trying to tinkle, so please be careful.

97
00:10:45,462 --> 00:10:46,183
[SPEAKER_23]: Here's the rule.

98
00:10:46,523 --> 00:10:50,827
[SPEAKER_23]: If the light is on and the fan is running, don't come a-knockin'.

99
00:10:52,188 --> 00:10:52,588
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright.

100
00:10:53,909 --> 00:10:55,511
[SPEAKER_23]: I couldn't come up with a rhyme for that, sorry.

101
00:10:59,154 --> 00:11:00,215
[SPEAKER_23]: I think your mic ain't on there.

102
00:11:00,795 --> 00:11:01,135
[SPEAKER_23]: Try it again.

103
00:11:01,316 --> 00:11:04,579
[SPEAKER_26]: If the fan is running, you better start running because you never know what they're doing in there.

104
00:11:04,819 --> 00:11:05,319
[SPEAKER_23]: Exactly.

105
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,220
[SPEAKER_23]: Something like that.

106
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:06,721
[SPEAKER_23]: Anyway.

107
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,802
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh yeah, relevant announcements.

108
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:15,268
[SPEAKER_23]: Did you hear, maybe we've mentioned it a couple times, that we're going to be doing a really big giveaway here on Orange Lounge Radio.

109
00:11:15,349 --> 00:11:20,253
[SPEAKER_23]: And I'm not talking about, you know, no small time little, you know, yada yada giveaway.

110
00:11:20,273 --> 00:11:22,015
[SPEAKER_23]: We're talking really big news here.

111
00:11:23,024 --> 00:11:38,239
[SPEAKER_23]: We are giving away, in conjunction with DDRspot.com, that's kind of why Floatwalk's here tonight, because he's a big part of the DDRspot community, Orange Launch Radio, in conjunction with DDRspot.com, is giving away signed Akira Yamoka CDs.

112
00:11:38,719 --> 00:11:39,180
[SPEAKER_23]: Very cool.

113
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,483
[SPEAKER_23]: We're going to be giving away two of them, so the contest is going to go for two weeks.

114
00:11:42,543 --> 00:11:43,344
[SPEAKER_23]: Now, here's the thing, though.

115
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:46,947
[SPEAKER_23]: We changed the rules a little bit from what we talked about last week.

116
00:11:46,967 --> 00:11:47,448
[SPEAKER_26]: Because we can.

117
00:11:48,228 --> 00:11:50,110
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, because we can't, basically, is what it boils down to.

118
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:56,494
[SPEAKER_23]: Now, and I know you love it when you hear that we changed the rules, but no, actually we did it to make the contest easier for you.

119
00:11:56,954 --> 00:11:57,635
[SPEAKER_23]: So here's the deal.

120
00:11:59,621 --> 00:12:01,483
[SPEAKER_23]: Forget what I said previously about how it's going to work.

121
00:12:01,643 --> 00:12:12,313
[SPEAKER_23]: How it's going to work now is that you know we have spin-off shows here on Orange Lounge Radio every Monday night, Diversion, the Orange Lounge Radio remix show, every Tuesday night, Pump Up the Volume with DarkSakura, and every Thursday night, Outside the Box with yours truly.

122
00:12:13,655 --> 00:12:16,637
[SPEAKER_23]: All of which are on at 7, although Pump Up the Volume technically starts at 7.30.

123
00:12:17,078 --> 00:12:24,205
[SPEAKER_23]: You've got to listen to those spin-off shows, and during the show at any time, we're going to ask a trivia question about Akira Yamaoka,

124
00:12:24,825 --> 00:12:29,610
[SPEAKER_23]: or it could be about something Akira Yamaoka was involved with, such as Silent Hill series would be a great one.

125
00:12:30,031 --> 00:12:31,052
[SPEAKER_23]: We're going to ask a trivia question.

126
00:12:31,232 --> 00:12:39,141
[SPEAKER_23]: If you know the answer to the trivia question, send an email to akira at orangeloungeradio.com and you will be entered into the contest.

127
00:12:39,441 --> 00:12:40,202
[SPEAKER_23]: That's the change.

128
00:12:40,282 --> 00:12:42,704
[SPEAKER_23]: You don't have to listen all three nights to be entered.

129
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:53,447
[SPEAKER_23]: But what the change does allow us to do is that if you do listen all three nights and you send us three emails with the three different answers, you'll be entered in the contest three times.

130
00:12:53,787 --> 00:12:57,488
[SPEAKER_23]: So you have three times the chance of somebody else if you listen all week long.

131
00:12:58,108 --> 00:13:03,249
[SPEAKER_23]: But if you just, you know what, if you have a busy schedule and you can only listen one night, you can still get one entry into the contest.

132
00:13:03,729 --> 00:13:06,070
[SPEAKER_23]: So the contest starts tomorrow.

133
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:14,834
[SPEAKER_23]: On the 15th, and it's going to run through the 20... It looks like the last entry chance will be on the 25th, Thanksgiving.

134
00:13:15,254 --> 00:13:15,995
[SPEAKER_23]: How appropriate.

135
00:13:16,475 --> 00:13:19,997
[SPEAKER_23]: Thanksgiving Day will be your last chance to enter, so look for that.

136
00:13:21,952 --> 00:13:24,874
[SPEAKER_23]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

137
00:13:45,351 --> 00:13:51,136
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm going to tell you, I'm going to tell you, as soon as we finish this segment here with How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day, some folks already know.

138
00:13:51,576 --> 00:13:56,200
[SPEAKER_23]: Some folks have already figured it out, but we will tell you officially what's going on in a minute.

139
00:13:57,781 --> 00:14:04,186
[SPEAKER_23]: As I said, we've got to start off every week's show with a little bit of How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day, and of course, the lovely Dark Sakura starting us off, as always.

140
00:14:04,906 --> 00:14:07,028
[SPEAKER_26]: My week was insanely busy.

141
00:14:07,748 --> 00:14:09,550
[SPEAKER_26]: Just school, everything.

142
00:14:10,631 --> 00:14:13,973
[SPEAKER_26]: And then today, my allergies have been killing me all day.

143
00:14:13,993 --> 00:14:14,814
[SPEAKER_26]: It's been...

144
00:14:15,575 --> 00:14:25,102
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm trying to not get sick and everyone's getting sick around me, but I'm hoping that by running away to Alabama in another week, I'll be escaping the whole thing.

145
00:14:29,646 --> 00:14:31,688
[SPEAKER_26]: But apart from that, I really didn't do a whole bunch of anything.

146
00:14:36,872 --> 00:14:37,552
[SPEAKER_26]: Dot, dot, dot.

147
00:14:38,093 --> 00:14:38,313
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

148
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:44,840
[SPEAKER_26]: As really, it's really been nothing but school and hanging out and just the same old crap I normally do.

149
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:55,422
[SPEAKER_26]: So, now as for Rob's week, first he went on an expedition to Alaska where the Eskimos kidnapped him and made him their king.

150
00:14:55,442 --> 00:14:57,323
[SPEAKER_23]: Stop telling lies while I'm out of the room.

151
00:14:58,143 --> 00:14:59,563
[SPEAKER_23]: Although that did happen, actually.

152
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,224
[SPEAKER_23]: It was three weeks ago, not last week.

153
00:15:01,284 --> 00:15:01,744
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, my bad.

154
00:15:01,764 --> 00:15:02,264
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, your bad.

155
00:15:03,024 --> 00:15:03,384
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, anyway.

156
00:15:03,824 --> 00:15:04,085
[SPEAKER_23]: Sorry.

157
00:15:04,565 --> 00:15:06,205
[SPEAKER_23]: I had to check on my laundry.

158
00:15:06,225 --> 00:15:10,607
[SPEAKER_23]: Because when Jamie comes over, she likes to not only do orange laundry.

159
00:15:10,807 --> 00:15:12,788
[SPEAKER_23]: This is how we pay Jamie for doing the show.

160
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:16,950
[SPEAKER_23]: Since we don't have money to exactly give out to people, we pay in laundry.

161
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:18,550
[SPEAKER_23]: In clean laundry.

162
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:19,511
[SPEAKER_26]: That way I don't have to use our...

163
00:15:20,922 --> 00:15:22,763
[SPEAKER_23]: Hey, that's worth a lot of quarters for the arcade.

164
00:15:25,485 --> 00:15:25,785
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright.

165
00:15:25,845 --> 00:15:28,767
[SPEAKER_26]: And I'll pay you back in sinus goo.

166
00:15:29,367 --> 00:15:29,767
[SPEAKER_23]: Hooray.

167
00:15:30,808 --> 00:15:31,729
[SPEAKER_23]: Just what I always wanted.

168
00:15:32,209 --> 00:15:33,630
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright, so that's it?

169
00:15:35,171 --> 00:15:36,271
[SPEAKER_23]: My week was boring.

170
00:15:36,912 --> 00:15:37,592
[SPEAKER_23]: What's up with that?

171
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:39,954
[SPEAKER_23]: The past two weeks you've been boring.

172
00:15:40,654 --> 00:15:41,595
[SPEAKER_26]: The past two weeks.

173
00:15:41,615 --> 00:15:44,076
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, I train people too.

174
00:15:44,096 --> 00:15:44,857
[SPEAKER_23]: That's my job.

175
00:15:45,237 --> 00:15:47,999
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, but I'm going to be going to Alabama though next week.

176
00:15:48,659 --> 00:15:49,900
[SPEAKER_23]: You're not going to be here for next week's show?

177
00:15:50,876 --> 00:15:55,898
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, I will be here Sunday, but that's Wednesday, the 24th.

178
00:15:56,098 --> 00:15:56,539
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm leaving.

179
00:15:56,939 --> 00:15:58,059
[SPEAKER_26]: Leaving on a plane.

180
00:15:58,419 --> 00:16:00,700
[SPEAKER_15]: Leaving on a jet plane.

181
00:16:01,481 --> 00:16:01,821
[SPEAKER_23]: Moving on.

182
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:06,303
[SPEAKER_23]: Actually, next Sunday is going to be an interesting show because I have to get up at 4 in the morning on that Monday.

183
00:16:06,323 --> 00:16:07,023
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm going to L.A.

184
00:16:07,043 --> 00:16:12,265
[SPEAKER_23]: for a day for work, so I didn't even think I'd be able to do this show, but it does look like I will be able to do this show.

185
00:16:12,786 --> 00:16:13,366
[SPEAKER_23]: Not that you care.

186
00:16:13,426 --> 00:16:18,008
[SPEAKER_23]: Anyway, Flo Walks, since you have a microphone, why don't you let us know how was your week, how was your day?

187
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:40,856
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, the week was different, because, um, as I just started, uh, my new job over at Princeton Review up in, uh, the city, and, uh, it's just really weird just seeing, like, just all the stuff that goes on, because mostly I do, like, um, I do a lot of, like, online-type QAs, so all the college applications they do online, I'm working on all that kind of stuff.

188
00:16:41,096 --> 00:16:48,159
[SPEAKER_21]: It's kind of funny, well, also kind of depressing in the sense that I'm sitting here thinking, I used to do this stuff for AltaVista about,

189
00:16:49,083 --> 00:17:15,082
[SPEAKER_21]: 4 years ago and I got paid about 3 times as much to do the same exact work I'm doing now and you'd always think it would be like kind of opposite considering you know like inflation all kind of stuff like yeah now I'd be making more since you know I've done it been there done that and it's just like regression and it's kind of a trippy feeling really um other than that it's just mostly been yeah just busy type of work week and then it's all on the personal side

190
00:17:15,441 --> 00:17:19,504
[SPEAKER_21]: I've actually been up in SACTO this week and I'm just, you know, visiting friends, you know, that kind of stuff.

191
00:17:20,064 --> 00:17:23,786
[SPEAKER_21]: It's kind of getting reacquainted with, uh, more games and all that jazz.

192
00:17:23,806 --> 00:17:26,628
[SPEAKER_21]: Been, like, playing Smackdown vs. Raw ad nauseum now.

193
00:17:27,509 --> 00:17:28,810
[SPEAKER_21]: And, uh, let's see.

194
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:30,631
[SPEAKER_21]: Gosh, it's, um...

195
00:17:31,769 --> 00:17:33,890
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, it's been a pretty tame week, all things considered.

196
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:44,794
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, now this coming week, we've got the whole Ultramix 2 thing coming out and stuff, so I'm sort of, you know, kind of thinking here, well, what can I officially disclaim, you know, as of right now?

197
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:48,495
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, it's like, what parts of the NDA can I blab about now?

198
00:17:48,515 --> 00:17:52,677
[SPEAKER_23]: But it's got to be a little bit of a relief now that most of the song list is out there, that you can kind of go...

199
00:17:53,803 --> 00:17:56,964
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, and for the record, I did not leave Konami in the first place.

200
00:17:57,405 --> 00:18:10,870
[SPEAKER_21]: As I see in the chat room, I was actually laid off, which is actually... It's a little something that I'll probably get into later, because it's probably an interesting note about what goes on, you know, the inner workings of a crazy lab like that.

201
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,551
[SPEAKER_23]: There's been lots of shake-ups in the video game world lately.

202
00:18:13,571 --> 00:18:15,052
[SPEAKER_23]: We'll get into that.

203
00:18:15,072 --> 00:18:16,512
[SPEAKER_23]: We'll get into one of the other ones later.

204
00:18:16,993 --> 00:18:18,773
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, yeah, funny enough.

205
00:18:19,193 --> 00:18:22,855
[SPEAKER_21]: But let's see, and then, you know, like I said, today, now it's just like...

206
00:18:23,243 --> 00:18:28,925
[SPEAKER_21]: Since I was up in Sacto, I figured, what the heck, you know, I'll just come on to Orange Lounge and show them a good time or something.

207
00:18:28,965 --> 00:18:34,266
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's really weird, because normally I have Shark Skrull with me, and she's not here, and it's kind of bummed.

208
00:18:34,406 --> 00:18:35,847
[SPEAKER_21]: Maybe she's listening.

209
00:18:36,867 --> 00:18:37,747
[SPEAKER_21]: Perhaps.

210
00:18:39,028 --> 00:18:42,149
[SPEAKER_21]: But she was up here one time when I wasn't, so I think we're catching up.

211
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:43,209
[SPEAKER_23]: That was a long time ago.

212
00:18:43,229 --> 00:18:43,849
[SPEAKER_23]: It was years ago.

213
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:45,510
[SPEAKER_23]: But yes, she was here one time when you weren't.

214
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:46,030
[SPEAKER_23]: I remember that.

215
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:46,710
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

216
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,851
[SPEAKER_21]: But once I laid off, I see on the...

217
00:18:51,239 --> 00:18:52,520
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, you knew it was going to come up.

218
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,240
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, yeah.

219
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:59,744
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I mean, it's really not a surprise for anyone who hasn't been familiar with the game industry or just QA in general.

220
00:19:00,324 --> 00:19:05,888
[SPEAKER_21]: Usually you're commissioned as, you know, working on a single project or just projects when they're available.

221
00:19:06,368 --> 00:19:11,731
[SPEAKER_21]: The way the video game industry works is usually they'll get their games around springtime or like early summer.

222
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:17,815
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, usually they start doing QA for demos for like E3, you know, just to make sure things are stable enough.

223
00:19:18,456 --> 00:19:18,876
[SPEAKER_21]: And then...

224
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:23,604
[SPEAKER_21]: Once that goes around, then obviously you go into development, and of course you need testers.

225
00:19:24,085 --> 00:19:26,127
[SPEAKER_21]: And then you test throughout the summer through like early fall.

226
00:19:26,427 --> 00:19:35,298
[SPEAKER_23]: Then once all the products get pushed out, I mean... Because everything, the big time for the gaming season is Christmas, so basically the games are being tested a couple months before then, right?

227
00:19:35,578 --> 00:19:35,818
[SPEAKER_23]: Right.

228
00:19:35,938 --> 00:19:40,179
[SPEAKER_23]: But you don't see a lot of big games coming out in January, February, unless you're Nintendo this year.

229
00:19:40,199 --> 00:19:48,942
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't... Nintendo has huge games coming out, but... But, um... Well, yeah, we got, okay, a few here and there, but even Suikoden IV was supposed to be out Christmas, wasn't it?

230
00:19:48,962 --> 00:19:49,662
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, it was.

231
00:19:49,682 --> 00:19:55,304
[SPEAKER_21]: It was supposed to be part of that big Konami extravaganza blowout thingamabob, but, um... Sunday, Sunday, Sunday!

232
00:19:55,324 --> 00:19:58,645
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

233
00:19:58,885 --> 00:20:03,506
[SPEAKER_21]: But once the, uh, around November rolls around, it's like, well, they don't have any projects left.

234
00:20:03,526 --> 00:20:05,087
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, the only thing you really do, like,

235
00:20:05,627 --> 00:20:11,511
[SPEAKER_21]: At Konami, for example, once all that's done, you'll probably either be doing a few text checks or you're doing customer service.

236
00:20:11,991 --> 00:20:15,734
[SPEAKER_21]: What really I found curious was they downsized customer service.

237
00:20:15,754 --> 00:20:25,320
[SPEAKER_21]: And you would think, around this time when all their new tiles are coming out, you need people to support people like, well, this game is crashing on my PC.

238
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:29,903
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's like 90% of any problems people have, like issues with Konami is,

239
00:20:31,015 --> 00:20:31,576
[SPEAKER_21]: PC GAMES

240
00:20:53,891 --> 00:20:58,695
[SPEAKER_23]: I want to address a couple of points that are in our chat room, www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on chat.

241
00:20:59,696 --> 00:21:04,280
[SPEAKER_23]: Toshin says, if you aren't a part of X company, isn't the NDA dissolved?

242
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:07,923
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh no, that's hardly the case.

243
00:21:08,163 --> 00:21:11,986
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, you can essentially say, yeah, I worked on it.

244
00:21:12,046 --> 00:21:13,768
[SPEAKER_21]: You can say something specific.

245
00:21:14,068 --> 00:21:20,033
[SPEAKER_21]: But NDA is kind of like, they use that for stuff like, well, obviously I couldn't tell you what kind of software they used for, you know,

246
00:21:20,493 --> 00:21:21,735
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't have a look.

247
00:21:21,755 --> 00:21:23,556
[SPEAKER_21]: I happen to be doing my homework here.

248
00:21:23,577 --> 00:21:25,118
[SPEAKER_21]: Jamie just pulled out her big business law textbook.

249
00:21:43,337 --> 00:21:45,198
[SPEAKER_23]: It's just going to thumb through it, see what it says.

250
00:21:45,278 --> 00:21:49,279
[SPEAKER_21]: It's essentially, I mean, to protect more or less like intellectual property of Konami.

251
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:54,181
[SPEAKER_23]: I would compare it to, let's say, the folks that go on that game show Survivor, right?

252
00:21:54,221 --> 00:21:55,662
[SPEAKER_23]: You've got 16 people that go on the show.

253
00:21:56,062 --> 00:21:57,922
[SPEAKER_23]: The damn thing's taped months in advance.

254
00:21:57,942 --> 00:22:08,706
[SPEAKER_23]: They already know who won the damn thing, or at least they know who the two finalists are, but the contestants are still all under that gag order where they can't talk about it until it airs on TV or else they get sued for $11 billion.

255
00:22:10,367 --> 00:22:12,929
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, yeah, that's essentially what it all boils down to.

256
00:22:13,069 --> 00:22:15,852
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, I have no problem adhering to that or any of that kind of stuff.

257
00:22:15,892 --> 00:22:17,493
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, you don't want to get sued for $11 billion.

258
00:22:17,533 --> 00:22:22,698
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, and you don't want to lose your job just because, you know, you want to sound cool and like, oh yeah, I got the inside scoop.

259
00:22:23,338 --> 00:22:32,246
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, it's a good thing that at least I'm pretty close with Jason, you know, it's because most of the stuff we do is DDR related, so anytime I ever even like

260
00:22:32,864 --> 00:22:37,086
[SPEAKER_21]: GetTempted to say anything, I'd talk to him first and be like, you know, is this cool, is this cool?

261
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:40,787
[SPEAKER_23]: I knew that Delirium was going to be on Ultramix 2 before any of you.

262
00:22:40,847 --> 00:22:42,168
[SPEAKER_23]: My internet penis is huge!

263
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:43,688
[SPEAKER_21]: I have it if you're ready, by the way.

264
00:22:43,708 --> 00:22:44,408
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, okay, yes.

265
00:22:44,448 --> 00:22:47,590
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I mean, it's, yeah, there, I mean, you'd be surprised.

266
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:57,173
[SPEAKER_21]: There are actually people who come to work for, you know, Konami at the time, and, like, one day they'll say, yeah, Rumble Roses was in office, and, you know, stuff like that, and, like, the guy will just get canned, like, in one hour.

267
00:22:58,074 --> 00:22:58,334
[SPEAKER_21]: So...

268
00:23:00,267 --> 00:23:08,128
[SPEAKER_21]: They're pretty serious about stuff like that, but I mean, overall, as long as you know when to say when, it's not a bad thing.

269
00:23:09,082 --> 00:23:09,462
[SPEAKER_23]: Interesting.

270
00:23:09,662 --> 00:23:10,683
[SPEAKER_23]: Jamie, yes, your textbook.

271
00:23:10,703 --> 00:23:11,503
[SPEAKER_26]: The textbook definition.

272
00:23:13,224 --> 00:23:21,567
[SPEAKER_26]: NDAs have been around for a long time and traditionally have been used among lawyers, investment bankers, and others involved in trade takeovers and other large corporate deals.

273
00:23:22,007 --> 00:23:29,169
[SPEAKER_26]: NDAs swear the signatory to secrecy about confidential ideas, trade secrets, and other non-public information revealed by the party proffering the NDA.

274
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:35,992
[SPEAKER_26]: So it's an actual contract and it's binding despite employment and anything else.

275
00:23:37,413 --> 00:23:38,013
[SPEAKER_23]: There you have it.

276
00:23:39,094 --> 00:23:40,434
[SPEAKER_23]: So in other words, you ain't talking!

277
00:23:40,954 --> 00:23:41,975
[SPEAKER_23]: You ain't gonna make me talk!

278
00:23:41,995 --> 00:23:46,516
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, basically, if you said, yeah, X-Song is gonna be in DDR, you could be sued for breach of contract.

279
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:49,977
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh yeah, but see, that's why I let everyone else handle all that.

280
00:23:50,057 --> 00:23:54,419
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, it's really gone to the point... Although at the same time, is it really that big a deal?

281
00:23:55,239 --> 00:24:02,881
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, and... I guess so, with the licenses, it could be, but especially when some licenses get cut right before the game comes out, I mean, that could be a big deal.

282
00:24:02,901 --> 00:24:04,922
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh yeah, I mean, you know, if not for people...

283
00:24:05,461 --> 00:24:32,568
[SPEAKER_21]: basically going through and like hacking party collection you would have you know you wouldn't have known about the songs that never made it into DDR for you know whatever reason or all that kind of stuff and funny enough it's usually licenses first that you know are often announced because obviously you need something to sell the game and you know you want to give the public something that's a familiar uh title that they can relate to like they say oh wow you know such and such artist yeah they're popular wow they got them in DDR that must be you know

284
00:24:32,967 --> 00:24:33,167
[SPEAKER_21]: DarkSakura

285
00:24:53,035 --> 00:24:54,035
[SPEAKER_23]: All right, well, fair enough.

286
00:24:54,416 --> 00:24:55,136
[SPEAKER_23]: That's what you got to do.

287
00:24:55,236 --> 00:24:57,097
[SPEAKER_23]: All right, moving on.

288
00:24:57,137 --> 00:25:00,118
[SPEAKER_23]: We were doing How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day before we got on that little tangent, but that was a good tangent.

289
00:25:00,138 --> 00:25:01,779
[SPEAKER_26]: I actually forgot to mention something that happened during my week.

290
00:25:01,899 --> 00:25:03,200
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

291
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,461
[SPEAKER_26]: I sprained my wrist, and they put me in a cast on Thursday, and I cut it off.

292
00:25:09,302 --> 00:25:10,583
[SPEAKER_23]: You took the law into your own hands?

293
00:25:10,603 --> 00:25:12,624
[SPEAKER_23]: You took the law of medicine into your own hands?

294
00:25:12,784 --> 00:25:15,105
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, and I'm not wearing my brace either because it sucks.

295
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,100
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, I'm done.

296
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,980
[SPEAKER_23]: Do you have any pictures of you and the cast, though?

297
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:22,201
[SPEAKER_26]: I do, I have one online, but since I can't access the chatroom, I can't post it.

298
00:25:23,081 --> 00:25:29,682
[SPEAKER_23]: I know, for some reason, I don't know why, but other side IRC, the network only lets two simultaneous connections from our house.

299
00:25:29,762 --> 00:25:40,424
[SPEAKER_26]: Actually, go to www.darksakura.com slash images slash fuckcast.jpg Okay, I will put that in and then post it in the chatroom if somebody doesn't beat me to it.

300
00:25:41,044 --> 00:25:42,105
[SPEAKER_23]: In the meantime, Loki!

301
00:25:42,985 --> 00:25:43,365
[SPEAKER_23]: How was your week?

302
00:25:43,385 --> 00:25:43,785
[SPEAKER_23]: How was your day?

303
00:25:45,683 --> 00:25:47,825
[SPEAKER_24]: My week was, you know, it was okay.

304
00:25:48,325 --> 00:25:48,946
[SPEAKER_24]: It was fine.

305
00:25:49,066 --> 00:25:50,947
[SPEAKER_24]: Until I got this fucking headache today!

306
00:25:51,368 --> 00:25:52,969
[SPEAKER_24]: And then it went really shitty!

307
00:25:55,091 --> 00:25:56,292
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't understand it.

308
00:25:56,372 --> 00:25:58,073
[SPEAKER_24]: I get headaches on Sundays.

309
00:25:59,394 --> 00:25:59,835
[SPEAKER_24]: Why?

310
00:26:00,796 --> 00:26:02,177
[SPEAKER_24]: It's always on Sundays.

311
00:26:02,317 --> 00:26:04,779
[SPEAKER_24]: It's always a sinus pressure headache.

312
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,122
[SPEAKER_24]: I think I'm allergic to something in this house.

313
00:26:08,182 --> 00:26:08,842
[SPEAKER_24]: It's gotta be.

314
00:26:10,604 --> 00:26:13,026
[SPEAKER_24]: But, yeah, I have a bad headache.

315
00:26:14,099 --> 00:26:17,721
[SPEAKER_23]: and it's only on Sundays, so it must be Jamie.

316
00:26:21,142 --> 00:26:23,823
[SPEAKER_24]: It was before she came over.

317
00:26:23,983 --> 00:26:26,464
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, I'm hypoallergenic.

318
00:26:27,685 --> 00:26:33,867
[SPEAKER_24]: So, yeah, it hurts and I'm trying to, I'm looking up home remedies on the internet right now.

319
00:26:35,288 --> 00:26:36,368
[SPEAKER_26]: I have all the remedy here.

320
00:26:36,548 --> 00:26:38,229
[SPEAKER_26]: It's called Vicks VapoRub in a tube.

321
00:26:39,449 --> 00:26:40,430
[SPEAKER_24]: All I have to say is...

322
00:26:41,325 --> 00:26:43,086
[SPEAKER_24]: This week was a lot of Final Fantasy.

323
00:26:43,386 --> 00:26:49,090
[SPEAKER_24]: I played a lot of Final Fantasy, leveling my characters, and then what else did I do?

324
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:50,031
[SPEAKER_24]: I did some other stuff.

325
00:26:50,091 --> 00:26:57,476
[SPEAKER_24]: I think I played some more Vice City, or not Vice City, San Andreas, and that's pretty much it.

326
00:26:58,576 --> 00:26:59,137
[SPEAKER_24]: Slow week.

327
00:27:01,018 --> 00:27:02,019
[SPEAKER_24]: So, yeah, that's about all.

328
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,141
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright, my week and my day.

329
00:27:05,441 --> 00:27:06,862
[SPEAKER_23]: I played a lot of Halo 2 this week.

330
00:27:07,964 --> 00:27:09,646
[SPEAKER_23]: Which I'm sure a lot of you guys are very proud to hear.

331
00:27:10,427 --> 00:27:17,834
[SPEAKER_23]: I'll tell you what though, man, we were talking about this a little bit on Outside the Box on Thursday, but the Xbox Live stuff is so detailed, it's crazy.

332
00:27:18,015 --> 00:27:28,506
[SPEAKER_23]: Being able to go onto Bungie.net and see your statistics down to, you can pull up a map of a game you just played and look at where you were killed and when, by who, it's crazy.

333
00:27:28,566 --> 00:27:29,567
[SPEAKER_23]: And what weapon they used to kill you?

334
00:27:30,196 --> 00:27:32,098
[SPEAKER_23]: It's just insane the amount of statistics they have for that.

335
00:27:32,138 --> 00:27:33,499
[SPEAKER_23]: So I've been having fun playing that online.

336
00:27:33,879 --> 00:27:35,580
[SPEAKER_23]: Although yesterday I did not have fun.

337
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,981
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, I'll get into that in the FU's of the week.

338
00:27:38,322 --> 00:27:41,205
[SPEAKER_23]: And then, what else did I do this week?

339
00:27:42,025 --> 00:27:43,587
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm not a whole lot Bomani related.

340
00:27:44,327 --> 00:27:47,470
[SPEAKER_23]: Because of Halo 2, my DDR diet fizzled pretty quickly there.

341
00:27:48,493 --> 00:27:48,753
[SPEAKER_23]: Coincidence?

342
00:28:07,318 --> 00:28:08,579
[SPEAKER_23]: Absolutely not.

343
00:28:09,899 --> 00:28:16,162
[SPEAKER_23]: As far as the rest of my week and my day, I didn't really do a whole lot, although I did go to Rice Princess, you know her from Outside the Box on Thursday nights.

344
00:28:16,583 --> 00:28:24,886
[SPEAKER_23]: She had her Harry Potter birthday party on Friday, and that was a lot of fun because we drank butter beer, and I drank all sorts of liquor, and I passed out on the floor.

345
00:28:24,986 --> 00:28:29,909
[SPEAKER_23]: In great tradition of me going to a party at Rice Princess and Lanky Styles' house, I passed out halfway through the party.

346
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:34,251
[SPEAKER_23]: And I really, I lost big time on Harry Potter trivia.

347
00:28:34,331 --> 00:28:34,911
[SPEAKER_23]: That made me sad.

348
00:28:35,834 --> 00:28:39,055
[SPEAKER_23]: But you know, since I don't read the books, I was kind of screwed from the beginning.

349
00:28:39,716 --> 00:28:41,016
[SPEAKER_23]: But then, this is the weird thing.

350
00:28:41,336 --> 00:28:45,958
[SPEAKER_23]: Then, the next night, after the Harry Potter party, the next night, what do they show on TV?

351
00:28:46,438 --> 00:28:48,299
[SPEAKER_23]: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.

352
00:28:48,659 --> 00:28:49,200
[SPEAKER_23]: Coincidence?

353
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,160
[SPEAKER_23]: I think not.

354
00:28:53,961 --> 00:28:55,242
[SPEAKER_24]: I think it's a big fat coincidence.

355
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:56,700
[SPEAKER_23]: You shut up.

356
00:28:58,221 --> 00:28:58,481
[SPEAKER_23]: All right.

357
00:28:58,981 --> 00:29:00,281
[SPEAKER_23]: That's pretty much it for my week of my day.

358
00:29:00,341 --> 00:29:01,761
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't have a whole lot exciting to report.

359
00:29:03,002 --> 00:29:05,843
[SPEAKER_23]: Although there is a lot of interesting stuff going on locally.

360
00:29:05,903 --> 00:29:07,963
[SPEAKER_23]: Now, I know that we are an international show.

361
00:29:08,003 --> 00:29:11,044
[SPEAKER_23]: We've got listeners in Canada, Japan, everywhere, and all across the U.S.

362
00:29:11,364 --> 00:29:15,965
[SPEAKER_23]: But sometimes we like to talk about what's going on in our neck of the woods here in NorCal, in Sacramento, the area where we're at.

363
00:29:16,365 --> 00:29:17,866
[SPEAKER_23]: We've heard a very interesting rumor.

364
00:29:17,946 --> 00:29:22,627
[SPEAKER_23]: And, Mel, you actually were the one that started perpetuating this rumor, because I guess you've heard this from the horse's mouth.

365
00:29:24,008 --> 00:29:25,768
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, you'll get the point in a second.

366
00:29:25,868 --> 00:29:29,809
[SPEAKER_23]: Derby Owners Club is coming to Sacramento from Milpitas.

367
00:29:30,069 --> 00:29:30,990
[SPEAKER_23]: It's leaving Milpitas.

368
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:31,410
[SPEAKER_23]: Bye-bye.

369
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:34,851
[SPEAKER_23]: And it's coming to Roseville Golf Land where games go to die.

370
00:29:35,591 --> 00:29:39,032
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, that does put a tear in my eye.

371
00:29:40,513 --> 00:29:44,154
[SPEAKER_21]: I guess probably there's a couple reasons why it's coming up there.

372
00:29:44,814 --> 00:29:54,257
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it's gone to the point where Milpitas, you know, you had a lot of people who were interested in the beginning and obviously it garnered a lot of, you know, people coming through a lot of traffic.

373
00:29:54,807 --> 00:29:59,730
[SPEAKER_21]: And then a couple factors, I mean you got D&B which is like about a mile and a half, two miles away which has it.

374
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:07,835
[SPEAKER_21]: It obviously pulls a lot of money and I think some of the older folks like going there for the simple fact you can actually like get drunk and play.

375
00:30:07,895 --> 00:30:08,435
[SPEAKER_23]: Exactly.

376
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:09,976
[SPEAKER_21]: And you know all that kind of stuff.

377
00:30:10,117 --> 00:30:12,058
[SPEAKER_23]: And you don't have to deal with birthday parties.

378
00:30:12,518 --> 00:30:13,679
[SPEAKER_21]: Just seriously.

379
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:18,742
[SPEAKER_21]: So and obviously Roseville is a pretty high traffic area I mean from what I hear.

380
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,420
[SPEAKER_21]: and there's none left.

381
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:26,042
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, if you love underage girls in bikinis, you will love Roseville Golf Land.

382
00:30:27,282 --> 00:30:28,542
[SPEAKER_23]: I love Roseville Golf Land.

383
00:30:29,102 --> 00:30:29,523
[SPEAKER_21]: I heart.

384
00:30:31,443 --> 00:30:40,465
[SPEAKER_21]: It's going to be the first one up in that region of California, like SACTO, and I know there are a lot of people up here who liked the game and had come down and played it and still keep their horses around.

385
00:30:41,065 --> 00:30:43,066
[SPEAKER_21]: And yes, Derby Owners Club is like

386
00:30:43,596 --> 00:30:45,216
[SPEAKER_21]: Initial D for Rednecks.

387
00:30:45,396 --> 00:30:51,538
[SPEAKER_23]: I know for a fact from last week's show, Iguana Girl and Islander are all about Derby Owners Club.

388
00:30:51,578 --> 00:30:52,478
[SPEAKER_23]: They'll be there.

389
00:30:53,238 --> 00:30:56,999
[SPEAKER_23]: I will have to hang my head in shame and go into that place, and I swore I'd never go back.

390
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:59,859
[SPEAKER_23]: But it doesn't just end with Derby Owners Club.

391
00:30:59,879 --> 00:31:00,579
[SPEAKER_23]: That's the weird thing.

392
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,620
[SPEAKER_23]: Jamie, I know you're going to go in for Derby Owners Club.

393
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,120
[SPEAKER_23]: You've got to.

394
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,400
[SPEAKER_23]: And maybe get some kids thrown out.

395
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:07,281
[SPEAKER_26]: My horses were stolen, so why?

396
00:31:08,401 --> 00:31:09,121
[SPEAKER_26]: You have to make new ones.

397
00:31:09,673 --> 00:31:11,034
[SPEAKER_23]: I'll hook you up with some of my breeds.

398
00:31:11,234 --> 00:31:12,295
[SPEAKER_26]: There you go.

399
00:31:12,395 --> 00:31:13,436
[SPEAKER_26]: I miss my tiger horse.

400
00:31:13,816 --> 00:31:14,196
[SPEAKER_23]: There you go.

401
00:31:15,337 --> 00:31:17,779
[SPEAKER_23]: But the weird thing is, now we're hearing this crazy rumor.

402
00:31:17,939 --> 00:31:18,900
[SPEAKER_23]: Crazy rumor!

403
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,342
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't even know if I should say it, but I have a big mouth, so I'm going to.

404
00:31:22,822 --> 00:31:24,604
[SPEAKER_23]: I figure if it's posted on the internet, I can say it.

405
00:31:25,744 --> 00:31:27,085
[SPEAKER_23]: If it's on the internet, it must be true.

406
00:31:27,246 --> 00:31:31,549
[SPEAKER_23]: If it's on the internet, it must be true, but rumor is that Sacramento is going to get 2DX again.

407
00:31:32,469 --> 00:31:34,531
[SPEAKER_23]: And it's coming courtesy of Camelot Golf Land.

408
00:31:34,551 --> 00:31:34,931
[SPEAKER_23]: Sorry, guys.

409
00:31:35,663 --> 00:31:39,384
[SPEAKER_23]: That's the rumor we hear, that Camelot Golfland's 2DX machine is coming up here.

410
00:31:39,504 --> 00:31:40,424
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm sorry, but not really.

411
00:31:41,104 --> 00:31:49,266
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't... I think that's a little more... I think the source is more reliable than the usual 2DX is coming to my neck of the woods source.

412
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:56,487
[SPEAKER_23]: But I still have such skepticism, because I just... And the rumor is it's supposed to be upgraded to red by the time it gets there.

413
00:31:56,908 --> 00:31:57,228
[SPEAKER_23]: Yippee!

414
00:31:57,568 --> 00:31:58,548
[SPEAKER_23]: But the thing is, is that...

415
00:31:59,386 --> 00:32:11,911
[SPEAKER_23]: I just, I would be so scared for that machine because it would die very quickly when all the kids start pounding on it with their wet little Golfland slide fingers and just, the Monty machines don't deserve to be treated that way.

416
00:32:12,772 --> 00:32:13,312
[SPEAKER_21]: No, they don't.

417
00:32:13,972 --> 00:32:22,696
[SPEAKER_21]: But I mean, I think, like I said, it's, when it all boils down to the bottom line, I mean, are more people going to come out to, like, friggin' Livermore to go play 2DX or, like, Sacto?

418
00:32:23,496 --> 00:32:24,917
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, you take your pick.

419
00:32:27,472 --> 00:32:28,793
[SPEAKER_23]: What, are you talking on Sacramento now?

420
00:32:28,873 --> 00:32:29,413
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm kidding.

421
00:32:29,453 --> 00:32:34,697
[SPEAKER_21]: No, I'm just, no, I was saying, you know, people are going to come to SACTO, not Livermore, you know, or whatever Camelot is.

422
00:32:34,737 --> 00:32:35,678
[SPEAKER_21]: That is Livermore, yeah.

423
00:32:36,058 --> 00:32:37,079
[SPEAKER_22]: I think, I don't know.

424
00:32:37,399 --> 00:32:37,499
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh.

425
00:32:38,499 --> 00:32:40,380
[SPEAKER_22]: No, I think that's in the south somewhere.

426
00:32:41,441 --> 00:32:42,302
[SPEAKER_22]: It's the Anaheim.

427
00:32:42,562 --> 00:32:43,242
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, the Anaheim one?

428
00:32:43,323 --> 00:32:44,203
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, okay, my bad.

429
00:32:44,263 --> 00:32:44,683
[SPEAKER_23]: I think.

430
00:32:45,424 --> 00:32:45,924
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

431
00:32:47,005 --> 00:32:47,646
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know.

432
00:32:47,666 --> 00:32:47,746
[SPEAKER_21]: Wow.

433
00:32:47,766 --> 00:32:48,686
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not sure about geography.

434
00:32:48,726 --> 00:32:49,407
[SPEAKER_23]: That's right, that's right.

435
00:32:49,647 --> 00:32:52,589
[SPEAKER_23]: I think that's the one that has the really bad tunnel vision screen.

436
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:54,691
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, the one where you have to... No, no, no, that was Shiggle.

437
00:32:54,711 --> 00:32:55,151
[SPEAKER_21]: That was Shiggle.

438
00:32:55,171 --> 00:32:56,652
[SPEAKER_21]: Shiggle had the night vision one.

439
00:32:56,692 --> 00:32:58,854
[SPEAKER_23]: But didn't Shiggle's machine go to Camelot?

440
00:32:59,414 --> 00:33:01,376
[SPEAKER_21]: I'd not be surprised when Shiggle closed down.

441
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:01,776
[SPEAKER_23]: I think so.

442
00:33:01,796 --> 00:33:04,678
[SPEAKER_23]: I think Shiggle's machine went to Camelot, and now it might be coming to Rozo.

443
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:08,521
[SPEAKER_23]: Shiggle is now an apartment complex, if I remember right.

444
00:33:08,641 --> 00:33:10,663
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, Shiggle is dead like disco.

445
00:33:12,945 --> 00:33:13,946
[SPEAKER_23]: Too many acronyms!

446
00:33:17,588 --> 00:33:17,849
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright.

447
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:20,090
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, we'll see if that's true or not.

448
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:21,812
[SPEAKER_23]: We do know the Derby Owners Club thing is true.

449
00:33:22,072 --> 00:33:23,393
[SPEAKER_23]: Where did you hear that from, anyway?

450
00:33:23,713 --> 00:33:27,797
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, I actually heard that from the management, from Milpitas Golf and Management himself.

451
00:33:28,137 --> 00:33:28,597
[SPEAKER_23]: Wow.

452
00:33:29,418 --> 00:33:30,619
[SPEAKER_23]: I bet they were sad to see it go.

453
00:33:31,351 --> 00:33:37,754
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know, I mean, I mean, yeah, they're obviously, you know, kind of sad, but At least there's more space for the birthday parties!

454
00:33:38,214 --> 00:33:57,622
[SPEAKER_21]: That's probably part of the reason, but I think, like I said, more so, it got to the point where they'd already, like, capped out as far as how many people will play, it's like, you kind of go to a point where you start low, start low, and then you eventually start getting a lot of, you know, people playing, and then, like, almost any other game, you outgrow it, and there was only, like,

455
00:33:58,163 --> 00:34:01,084
[SPEAKER_21]: So many hardcore people that still stayed around and played.

456
00:34:01,144 --> 00:34:04,266
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, they're obviously in an uproar right now.

457
00:34:04,426 --> 00:34:07,847
[SPEAKER_21]: But it's like they're having their farewell send-off this weekend.

458
00:34:07,867 --> 00:34:09,628
[SPEAKER_21]: Like, they had a G1 tournament.

459
00:34:10,088 --> 00:34:12,289
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's like they have a bunch of people playing.

460
00:34:12,329 --> 00:34:13,690
[SPEAKER_21]: It's like a hundred bucks to enter.

461
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:14,751
[SPEAKER_21]: Jeez.

462
00:34:15,191 --> 00:34:18,712
[SPEAKER_21]: Seriously, these people are like freaking jeez when it comes to playing this game.

463
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:26,456
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, they're like, yeah, I got a 30th generation, you know, Thunderboy Princess, and he can't be beat on dirt, and et cetera, et cetera, and...

464
00:34:27,501 --> 00:34:32,067
[SPEAKER_21]: It's, I mean, I'd be into tournaments if it didn't cost a hundred bucks a pop to play, you know.

465
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:34,230
[SPEAKER_23]: Is it true that there's celebrities that come to play?

466
00:34:34,731 --> 00:34:35,572
[SPEAKER_23]: Um, yeah, actually.

467
00:34:36,113 --> 00:34:42,241
[SPEAKER_21]: It's funny enough, um, the people that, like, as far as celebrities that are interested in it are mostly athletes.

468
00:34:42,773 --> 00:34:43,314
[SPEAKER_21]: D&B, Milpitas, Santa Clara

469
00:34:58,957 --> 00:34:59,277
[SPEAKER_21]: and a lot more.

470
00:35:30,276 --> 00:35:30,576
[SPEAKER_23]: All right.

471
00:35:31,977 --> 00:35:36,720
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, hopefully, maybe we'll start seeing some celebrities at Roseville Golf Line, though I doubt it.

472
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:37,240
[SPEAKER_23]: You never know.

473
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,061
[SPEAKER_23]: You probably might see some... Maybe Schwarzenegger.

474
00:35:39,081 --> 00:35:40,682
[SPEAKER_23]: That's the only celebrity that lives in Sacramento.

475
00:35:41,002 --> 00:35:42,303
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, that and, like, the Kings.

476
00:35:43,984 --> 00:35:45,185
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, bastard, you horse!

477
00:35:47,566 --> 00:35:48,426
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm going to whip you!

478
00:35:48,867 --> 00:35:49,707
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm going to whip you!

479
00:35:50,328 --> 00:35:52,269
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm going to whip you like the Indian casinos!

480
00:35:53,049 --> 00:35:54,450
[SPEAKER_22]: If you do not win, I will gulp you!

481
00:35:58,228 --> 00:35:59,489
[SPEAKER_23]: On that note, we're going to go to a break.

482
00:35:59,769 --> 00:36:00,890
[SPEAKER_23]: We're going to continue the... Girly horse!

483
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:02,891
[SPEAKER_23]: Girly horse!

484
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:03,951
[SPEAKER_23]: You're a girly horse!

485
00:36:04,011 --> 00:36:05,312
[SPEAKER_23]: A silly little girly horse.

486
00:36:08,414 --> 00:36:09,675
[SPEAKER_23]: Welcome to Orange Laundry, everybody.

487
00:36:10,075 --> 00:36:13,837
[SPEAKER_23]: I am going to get to that announcement, but we'll go to a break first, because I like announcements after breaks.

488
00:36:13,857 --> 00:36:14,397
[SPEAKER_23]: It's just me.

489
00:36:15,238 --> 00:36:21,962
[SPEAKER_23]: In this break, another brand new Ultramix 2 song, as spoiled by the website, which went up over the weekend.

490
00:36:21,982 --> 00:36:24,063
[SPEAKER_23]: If you want a link to that, just visit orangelaundry.com.

491
00:36:24,083 --> 00:36:24,803
[SPEAKER_23]: We have a link right there.

492
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:26,064
[SPEAKER_23]: It's like our top news story.

493
00:36:27,065 --> 00:36:27,445
[SPEAKER_23]: Enter...

494
00:36:29,133 --> 00:36:34,396
[SPEAKER_23]: In this break, oh hello, we're just joined by Explicit randomly during that break.

495
00:36:34,416 --> 00:36:35,977
[SPEAKER_23]: That's alright, we're going to go to a break right now.

496
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:44,082
[SPEAKER_23]: This song is, the interesting thing about this song, it's also in that other dancing game.

497
00:36:44,603 --> 00:36:46,924
[SPEAKER_23]: And we'll talk about that and how interesting that must be.

498
00:36:47,244 --> 00:36:50,967
[SPEAKER_23]: The song is Vanilla Ninja and it's called Tough Enough.

499
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:52,984
[SPEAKER_23]: I really like this song.

500
00:36:53,104 --> 00:36:54,104
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, it's an awesome song.

501
00:36:54,164 --> 00:36:56,705
[SPEAKER_23]: And it was like my favorite song in that other dancing game.

502
00:36:56,725 --> 00:36:57,866
[SPEAKER_23]: We're going to talk about that when we come back.

503
00:36:58,446 --> 00:36:59,306
[SPEAKER_23]: We'll be right back after this.

504
00:37:00,547 --> 00:37:08,610
[SPEAKER_15]: Baby, I'll be the strong one to survive All for me to be the light

505
00:37:25,238 --> 00:37:27,961
[SPEAKER_15]: and the Lonely Freak, Queen of the Broken Shield.

506
00:37:28,041 --> 00:37:34,085
[SPEAKER_15]: So keep on picking the palm leaves, pick it, don't stop, don't feel, run away, go for the fire, baby, that's up to now.

507
00:37:34,146 --> 00:37:40,331
[SPEAKER_09]: So keep on living, don't stop, even the devil, we can get you in the season of heartbreak, baby, that's up to now.

508
00:38:06,811 --> 00:38:18,291
[SPEAKER_15]: Never trust my smiley face Because I can change all your dreams And my tears can't fade

509
00:38:23,917 --> 00:38:35,847
Don't keep on thinking the bomb is ticking, don't stop, don't fear, run away before the fire, baby, that's up to none Don't keep on living the song, not even the devil's free, get you in the deep of the heartbreak, baby, that's up to none

511
00:40:12,185 --> 00:40:23,635
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, we're going to do one more song here in this Ultramix 2 break.

512
00:40:23,655 --> 00:40:26,157
[SPEAKER_23]: We're going to do... Whoops, nope, not that.

513
00:40:26,217 --> 00:40:27,017
[SPEAKER_23]: That's not in Ultramix 2.

514
00:40:27,618 --> 00:40:30,140
[SPEAKER_23]: We're going to do... Which one did I want to do here?

515
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:30,700
[SPEAKER_23]: Ah, here it is.

516
00:40:31,301 --> 00:40:32,482
[SPEAKER_23]: This is an interesting song.

517
00:40:32,562 --> 00:40:35,444
[SPEAKER_23]: The band is called Or If Is.

518
00:40:36,245 --> 00:40:37,046
[SPEAKER_23]: Like, or if is.

519
00:40:37,266 --> 00:40:37,586
[SPEAKER_23]: Get it?

520
00:40:37,906 --> 00:40:39,768
[SPEAKER_23]: And it's called I Spy.

521
00:40:40,328 --> 00:40:40,709
[SPEAKER_23]: Enjoy.

522
00:40:43,813 --> 00:40:44,855
Thanks for watching!

523
00:41:19,077 --> 00:41:19,747
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks for watching!

524
00:42:32,457 --> 00:42:41,204
[SPEAKER_15]: easier to dance to than that freaking catch up song Orange Lounge Radio we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio and that break you heard or if this or if this

525
00:43:03,009 --> 00:43:09,052
[SPEAKER_23]: Or if it isn't, with a song called I Spy, and before that, Vanilla Ninja with Tough Enough.

526
00:43:09,952 --> 00:43:17,735
[SPEAKER_23]: Now, I remember when I first heard that song, I was kind of like, wait a minute, I've heard this before.

527
00:43:18,215 --> 00:43:19,916
[SPEAKER_23]: And I was like, where the hell have I heard this before?

528
00:43:20,516 --> 00:43:25,198
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh my god, this song was on In The Groove when I went back and played it in Jersey a few months ago.

529
00:43:26,618 --> 00:43:27,198
[SPEAKER_21]: Coincidence?

530
00:43:27,258 --> 00:43:28,219
[SPEAKER_21]: What the hell happened there?

531
00:43:28,679 --> 00:43:41,684
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know, but I would be surprised if, you know, I mean, because Vanilla Ninja is a German group, I would be surprised if they just kind of like were of the opinion, hey, let's whore out our song to, you know, as many people as possible, and that very well might have been the case.

532
00:43:41,844 --> 00:43:51,128
[SPEAKER_23]: Now, obviously, since, you know, games are tested and planned for months in advance, this song was included in Ultimix 2 before In The Groove was ever released, right?

533
00:43:51,884 --> 00:43:53,805
[SPEAKER_21]: Honestly, I don't know the timing on that one.

534
00:43:54,065 --> 00:43:54,845
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm pretty sure it was.

535
00:43:55,485 --> 00:43:57,145
[SPEAKER_23]: I think so, but we'll see.

536
00:43:58,626 --> 00:44:00,166
[SPEAKER_23]: So, this is very interesting.

537
00:44:00,466 --> 00:44:01,546
[SPEAKER_23]: Anything else you want to share?

538
00:44:01,927 --> 00:44:04,007
[SPEAKER_23]: It's the only song in Ultramix 2 that has a video, right?

539
00:44:05,047 --> 00:44:06,048
[SPEAKER_23]: That has a music video?

540
00:44:06,148 --> 00:44:07,428
[SPEAKER_21]: It does have a music video, yes.

541
00:44:08,348 --> 00:44:09,268
[SPEAKER_21]: Interesting.

542
00:44:10,069 --> 00:44:12,089
[SPEAKER_21]: And they're not some bad-looking girls, either.

543
00:44:12,829 --> 00:44:19,991
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, kind of like, you know, take Vixen or any of those female hair metal bands and kind of pop them up a little, and yeah.

544
00:44:21,206 --> 00:44:27,629
[SPEAKER_21]: you got Vanilla Ninja and they actually have a website out there and all that kind of stuff and I wish I knew German so I could get myself a free autograph.

545
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:33,532
[SPEAKER_21]: So if anyone can do some German translation for me, holler back.

546
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:35,052
[SPEAKER_15]: Autograph bitte.

547
00:44:37,813 --> 00:44:39,914
[SPEAKER_23]: So can you tell us anything else about the video?

548
00:44:40,715 --> 00:44:44,336
[SPEAKER_23]: Because I'm assuming if we could look hard enough we could probably find the video, but I don't know.

549
00:44:46,504 --> 00:44:48,226
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a pretty, you know, rockin' video.

550
00:44:48,306 --> 00:44:50,368
[SPEAKER_21]: It's like, obviously you've got the vampires playing.

551
00:44:50,688 --> 00:45:00,957
[SPEAKER_21]: I guess the best way to describe it in a nutshell is, if you took Christina Aguilera's Dirty video and made it, like, presentable so, like, the ESRB wouldn't nail us.

552
00:45:01,217 --> 00:45:05,521
[SPEAKER_21]: It's kind of, well, it's just more so the setting, but it's a cool video.

553
00:45:05,541 --> 00:45:10,224
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, it's a hell of a lot less scandalous than Do That Thing from Ultramix One, so...

554
00:45:12,166 --> 00:45:15,467
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh no, we're talking about Vanilla Ninja's Tough Enough from Ultramix 2.

555
00:45:17,128 --> 00:45:21,229
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, like you said, I know you've been out of it, but there's a whole lot of Ultramix 2 news this week, so.

556
00:45:23,209 --> 00:45:23,669
[SPEAKER_23]: That's alright.

557
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:37,633
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, actually, if you want to see, because actually the way we know that that video is in there is that actually if you go to the Ultramix 2 website, there's still one of the screenshots they have has the video in it, so you can kind of get a little glimpse of what it looks like there, so.

558
00:45:37,673 --> 00:45:37,794
[SPEAKER_23]: So.

559
00:45:39,721 --> 00:45:41,823
[SPEAKER_23]: But they're easy on the eyes, for the most part.

560
00:45:43,064 --> 00:45:43,464
[SPEAKER_23]: Definitely.

561
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:50,429
[SPEAKER_23]: I think, actually, because when somebody on DDR Freak made the connection that that was the Vanilla Ninja video, I think they actually linked to the video, I want to say.

562
00:45:50,769 --> 00:45:52,210
[SPEAKER_23]: See, I think you can go check it out over there.

563
00:45:52,270 --> 00:45:53,932
[SPEAKER_23]: I just was too lazy to check it out myself.

564
00:45:55,773 --> 00:45:56,073
[SPEAKER_23]: All right.

565
00:45:57,995 --> 00:46:00,557
[SPEAKER_23]: So, moving on, we just got some more guests in the house here.

566
00:46:01,557 --> 00:46:02,638
[SPEAKER_23]: Like you, Sal, how was your week?

567
00:46:02,678 --> 00:46:04,359
[SPEAKER_23]: How was your day?

568
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:05,000
[SPEAKER_25]: Pretty good.

569
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:05,740
[SPEAKER_25]: It's been working.

570
00:46:06,301 --> 00:46:06,501
[SPEAKER_25]: Yep.

571
00:46:07,962 --> 00:46:10,906
[SPEAKER_23]: Wow, it's so weird to hear you and work together.

572
00:46:10,926 --> 00:46:11,546
[SPEAKER_25]: You know what?

573
00:46:11,586 --> 00:46:12,428
[SPEAKER_25]: Fuck you, buddy.

574
00:46:13,289 --> 00:46:16,893
[SPEAKER_25]: It's so weird to hear you and attractive in the same sentence.

575
00:46:17,514 --> 00:46:18,776
[SPEAKER_25]: Wait, nobody said that, though.

576
00:46:18,856 --> 00:46:20,158
[SPEAKER_25]: Anyway, yeah, just have the big...

577
00:46:21,141 --> 00:46:21,361
[SPEAKER_25]: and so on.

578
00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:44,184
[SPEAKER_23]: So at one point I was like, god damn it, and I just went to the first place, I knew where there was a bed.

579
00:46:44,504 --> 00:46:48,165
[SPEAKER_23]: I wasn't exactly going to go into your roommate's room and pass out on their bed.

580
00:46:48,325 --> 00:46:49,345
[SPEAKER_23]: That would have been interesting.

581
00:46:49,365 --> 00:46:51,346
[SPEAKER_23]: That would have been kind of funny, actually.

582
00:46:51,386 --> 00:46:52,986
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, but we don't need to get into that.

583
00:46:53,126 --> 00:46:54,046
[SPEAKER_23]: That's right, that's right.

584
00:46:54,367 --> 00:46:58,147
[SPEAKER_25]: Anyway, other than that, been working and making the dough.

585
00:46:59,168 --> 00:47:00,608
[SPEAKER_25]: Yep, good stuff.

586
00:47:00,768 --> 00:47:01,468
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright, good stuff.

587
00:47:02,348 --> 00:47:04,209
[SPEAKER_23]: Explicit also joined us during the break there.

588
00:47:04,249 --> 00:47:05,069
[SPEAKER_23]: How was your week, how was your day?

589
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:07,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

590
00:47:21,691 --> 00:47:22,692
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, sort of, in a way.

591
00:47:22,792 --> 00:47:25,574
[SPEAKER_23]: So what, you have like your weekend bed and your weekday bed?

592
00:47:25,834 --> 00:47:30,276
[SPEAKER_23]: Or is there one bedroom that's for the ladies, and then one bedroom... Oh, yeah!

593
00:47:31,357 --> 00:47:40,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of ladies, speaking of ladies, I'm supposed to go to a strip club like next two weeks to celebrate to my cousin's 18th birthdays.

594
00:47:42,124 --> 00:47:43,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Guess I'm gonna have to eat some pussy again.

595
00:47:46,246 --> 00:47:46,787
[SPEAKER_26]: You know what?

596
00:47:46,827 --> 00:47:47,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Go club.

597
00:47:47,567 --> 00:47:48,308
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't need to hear that.

598
00:47:51,744 --> 00:47:52,746
[SPEAKER_23]: Gold Club Center Poles.

599
00:47:52,866 --> 00:47:55,270
[SPEAKER_23]: Wow, I was wondering when this show was going to go in the toilet.

600
00:47:55,290 --> 00:47:55,671
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

601
00:47:57,614 --> 00:47:58,837
[SPEAKER_24]: But I missed what it was about.

602
00:47:59,277 --> 00:47:59,879
[SPEAKER_23]: That's quite all right.

603
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:01,341
[SPEAKER_23]: Anyway.

604
00:48:04,815 --> 00:48:05,936
[SPEAKER_23]: I already talked about Halo 2.

605
00:48:06,396 --> 00:48:09,818
[SPEAKER_23]: That was pretty much my week.

606
00:48:11,699 --> 00:48:14,061
[SPEAKER_23]: Anything new going on at Paradise Island, the place where you work?

607
00:48:14,081 --> 00:48:14,901
[SPEAKER_23]: You're still working there, right?

608
00:48:14,981 --> 00:48:15,401
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah.

609
00:48:15,562 --> 00:48:16,242
[SPEAKER_23]: Anything new going on?

610
00:48:16,262 --> 00:48:18,343
[SPEAKER_04]: We might get a new arcade vendor.

611
00:48:18,603 --> 00:48:23,086
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a possibility since, for some stupid reason, they're not opening up their machines anymore.

612
00:48:23,927 --> 00:48:27,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Because pad vending is like... I think we're losing contract and stuff.

613
00:48:28,269 --> 00:48:32,812
[SPEAKER_04]: We might get a vendor from the Bay Area and stuff so we can get... Oh, yeah.

614
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:36,342
[SPEAKER_04]: So I could talk to them by trying to get Beatmania 2DX read there.

615
00:48:36,362 --> 00:48:37,782
[SPEAKER_22]: That'd be nice.

616
00:48:39,543 --> 00:48:40,004
[SPEAKER_23]: Interesting.

617
00:48:41,365 --> 00:48:41,745
[SPEAKER_23]: Interesting.

618
00:48:42,785 --> 00:48:45,987
[SPEAKER_23]: Is it a bitch to work through a vendor?

619
00:48:47,868 --> 00:48:48,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell yeah!

620
00:48:48,989 --> 00:48:51,290
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a deal with them during the last tournament for FU.

621
00:48:53,932 --> 00:48:58,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm not sure if I had a deal with them again in February for Sacktown Smackdown tournament.

622
00:48:59,535 --> 00:49:02,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I'm organizing another tournament in Sacramento.

623
00:49:02,895 --> 00:49:04,156
[SPEAKER_22]: All right, we'll be there, I'm sure.

624
00:49:04,676 --> 00:49:06,137
[SPEAKER_22]: It's early February.

625
00:49:06,357 --> 00:49:07,018
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm sure we'll be there.

626
00:49:07,999 --> 00:49:08,279
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

627
00:49:08,879 --> 00:49:10,200
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's see.

628
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:12,362
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm just preparing for SVGL3.

629
00:49:15,604 --> 00:49:18,206
[SPEAKER_04]: SVGL3, the tournament in December.

630
00:49:19,670 --> 00:49:21,511
[SPEAKER_23]: That's right, I completely forgot about that.

631
00:49:21,811 --> 00:49:22,812
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm definitely going to that.

632
00:49:22,832 --> 00:49:24,513
[SPEAKER_23]: I just kind of forgot that it was right around the corner.

633
00:49:25,193 --> 00:49:27,134
[SPEAKER_23]: Didn't they announce that tournament, like, months ago?

634
00:49:27,655 --> 00:49:32,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was supposedly during the summertime, but they moved it to the winter, I'm assuming.

635
00:49:32,658 --> 00:49:33,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, interesting.

636
00:49:33,358 --> 00:49:39,281
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was supposedly canceled because I assume, like, DCB doesn't want to be the main organizer for it anymore.

637
00:49:39,682 --> 00:49:41,483
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, I'm sure somebody will pick it up if he didn't want to.

638
00:49:41,523 --> 00:49:42,283
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know what's going on.

639
00:49:42,383 --> 00:49:43,664
[SPEAKER_23]: Someone else picked it up already.

640
00:49:43,744 --> 00:49:46,065
[SPEAKER_23]: I've been so out of the loop on that stuff.

641
00:49:46,105 --> 00:49:48,827
[SPEAKER_04]: I was so out of the loop ever since the drama and shit coming around.

642
00:49:51,353 --> 00:49:53,935
[SPEAKER_04]: And for the downs I'll announce later.

643
00:50:11,914 --> 00:50:14,615
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be one hell of a ride for the FUs on that one.

644
00:50:14,835 --> 00:50:16,796
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm looking forward to it.

645
00:50:18,837 --> 00:50:23,439
[SPEAKER_23]: I kind of didn't get to talk enough about the whole Vanilla Ninja coincidence there within the groove and stuff.

646
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:26,401
[SPEAKER_23]: Are you afraid of the backlash that might be coming?

647
00:50:27,182 --> 00:50:28,363
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know, kind of hard to say.

648
00:50:29,203 --> 00:50:31,144
[SPEAKER_23]: You know there's going to be critics out there.

649
00:50:32,225 --> 00:50:38,248
[SPEAKER_23]: You already kind of know that with the step data, that's the first thing people always complain about with the new DDR mix is the steps.

650
00:50:38,588 --> 00:50:40,769
[SPEAKER_23]: Somebody will not like the steps, that's just a given.

651
00:50:41,389 --> 00:50:46,292
[SPEAKER_23]: But now you've got the fact that now people have something they're going to keep comparing it to, and it's kind of like, ugh.

652
00:50:48,073 --> 00:51:09,004
[SPEAKER_21]: I didn't like the competition stepped out of very much, and I'm not saying that, you know, as a biased opinion, I mean, I got more or less a lot of confidence in the people who I know who did the stepped out of for Ultramix 2, but in the groove, I mean, you know, obviously that's where it came from, obviously, it's like, you know, I mean, there's some, it's,

653
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:32,190
[SPEAKER_21]: almost half of it was like what you would expect already but they have a knack for throwing in like odd rhythms for like no reason right like yeah you just kind of wonder if they're listening to the same song you are you know but that's just hopefully it's not the same edit oh no no not I'll try like I said if I can say ours is better obviously ours is different okay and you know I mean I have to you know personally

654
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:37,372
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, back it up because I did do some of the step data for some of the modes.

655
00:51:37,812 --> 00:51:40,513
[SPEAKER_23]: I think it's interesting more than anything else.

656
00:51:40,793 --> 00:51:43,054
[SPEAKER_23]: You're going to have the same song in two different games.

657
00:51:43,414 --> 00:51:45,936
[SPEAKER_23]: Two different cuts and two different sets of steps.

658
00:51:46,016 --> 00:51:48,076
[SPEAKER_23]: Very interesting to see the differences there.

659
00:51:50,276 --> 00:51:51,877
[SPEAKER_23]: At least yours isn't going to have mines, right?

660
00:51:52,977 --> 00:51:53,657
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, God, no.

661
00:51:53,677 --> 00:51:54,117
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

662
00:51:54,157 --> 00:51:54,418
[SPEAKER_23]: All right.

663
00:51:54,538 --> 00:51:59,700
[SPEAKER_21]: And for the record, I saw Miklatov make a comment about, like, all the girls being looking like men.

664
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:00,480
[SPEAKER_21]: No, they don't.

665
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:03,541
[SPEAKER_21]: Only the one girl who has the bad, like, 70s ABBA hair.

666
00:52:03,941 --> 00:52:07,402
[SPEAKER_21]: Only, you know, yeah, her bangs kind of throw her off, but she cleaned up since.

667
00:52:08,123 --> 00:52:08,803
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

668
00:52:09,303 --> 00:52:12,184
[SPEAKER_21]: And they still have that one girl, the youngest girl, who looks like Pornikova.

669
00:52:12,204 --> 00:52:13,425
[SPEAKER_21]: Pornikova.

670
00:52:14,045 --> 00:52:14,285
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

671
00:52:14,935 --> 00:52:16,836
[SPEAKER_21]: Anything that looks like Pornokova is good to me.

672
00:52:40,149 --> 00:52:49,173
[SPEAKER_23]: This year we have 18 November, which is going to be the big day that 8th Style Consumer Version is out, Poppin' Music 10 is out, and DDR Festival is all going to come out.

673
00:52:49,313 --> 00:52:54,175
[SPEAKER_23]: And now we find out Ultramix 2 got pushed back to an 18 November ship day.

674
00:52:54,575 --> 00:52:56,876
[SPEAKER_23]: So the Americans get in on it too a little bit.

675
00:52:56,956 --> 00:52:58,416
[SPEAKER_23]: So it's going to be a very big week.

676
00:52:58,756 --> 00:53:01,838
[SPEAKER_23]: So this week's show, this next week's show is going to be huge.

677
00:53:02,418 --> 00:53:04,479
[SPEAKER_23]: Tonight we're just mediocre, but next week, huge.

678
00:53:05,694 --> 00:53:06,935
[SPEAKER_23]: This is an orgy waiting to happen.

679
00:53:37,103 --> 00:53:41,404
[SPEAKER_02]: I just read this from Bimani Style about last Tuesday.

680
00:53:41,464 --> 00:53:47,665
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Paranoia posted that Jason Eno is wanting to bring out 2DX in the US.

681
00:53:49,305 --> 00:53:50,626
[SPEAKER_02]: What is your reaction about that?

682
00:53:51,686 --> 00:53:57,367
[SPEAKER_21]: Obviously, who in the Bimani community would not want to see 2DX in America?

683
00:53:58,047 --> 00:54:03,048
[SPEAKER_21]: There's no doubt that there has been enough music games within the past

684
00:54:03,695 --> 00:54:03,915
[SPEAKER_21]: 3-4 years

685
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:30,785
[SPEAKER_21]: How much are people going to pay for a peripheral to a game that is completely, absolutely new?

686
00:54:31,205 --> 00:54:32,106
[SPEAKER_21]: You're not sure about that?

687
00:54:32,146 --> 00:54:39,009
[SPEAKER_23]: Then you've got to think... But maybe the success of games like Donkey Konga and hopefully Taiko Drum Master, maybe that would be incentive, hopefully.

688
00:54:39,029 --> 00:54:39,889
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, that's true.

689
00:54:40,029 --> 00:54:40,149
[SPEAKER_21]: Maybe.

690
00:54:40,169 --> 00:54:43,131
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, well let's take it one step further.

691
00:54:44,332 --> 00:54:47,855
[SPEAKER_21]: You got people, like I said, B-Money fans who would like to see, you know, a US version.

692
00:54:47,875 --> 00:54:48,876
[SPEAKER_21]: They probably would want to buy it.

693
00:54:48,936 --> 00:54:52,579
[SPEAKER_21]: That said, how difficult do you make it on the get-go?

694
00:54:53,179 --> 00:54:56,142
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, you know, do you want to make it easy enough for people to get it?

695
00:54:56,162 --> 00:54:59,805
[SPEAKER_21]: Because, I mean, truth be told, 2DX is not an easy B-Money, you know.

696
00:55:00,445 --> 00:55:00,505
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

697
00:55:00,525 --> 00:55:11,549
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, like, when you compare, you know, like, the major four, for example, like, I'll say 2DX, like, if you take the hardest song from DDR compared to, like, the hardest song in Guitar Freaks to, like, you know, 2DX, I mean, 2DX is a pretty difficult game.

698
00:55:11,909 --> 00:55:19,132
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, you know, I mean, of course it can be beat within reasonable time and such, but then you gotta think, you know, it's like, well, are we gonna have a beginner mode for US?

699
00:55:19,192 --> 00:55:23,174
[SPEAKER_21]: Are we only gonna make it up to, like, you know, the hardest song is maybe just the normal seven?

700
00:55:23,214 --> 00:55:24,374
[SPEAKER_21]: Is it gonna be a flashing seven?

701
00:55:24,755 --> 00:55:32,096
[SPEAKER_21]: You gotta wonder about, like, being able to appease new fans, but at the same time, you don't want to insult the intelligence of, like... The loyalists.

702
00:55:32,156 --> 00:55:40,538
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, of the, you know, hardcore people, so it's kind of a hard... I think, I mean, just coming from me, I think that would be a little bit of a hard thing to gauge.

703
00:55:40,558 --> 00:55:45,259
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, I don't think it's impossible, and I mean, like anyone, I would like to see it come over.

704
00:55:45,639 --> 00:55:47,499
[SPEAKER_21]: Whether it will or not, I mean, you never know.

705
00:55:47,679 --> 00:55:51,640
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, obviously, with the success Fiamani has been having, it's...

706
00:55:52,957 --> 00:55:56,578
[SPEAKER_21]: It's making a case stronger and stronger each day, so whenever it happens, you know.

707
00:55:56,938 --> 00:56:02,040
[SPEAKER_23]: From your perspective, having been on the inside at one point, is there anything you think we could do as Pomani fans to help?

708
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:04,721
[SPEAKER_23]: Like, are petitions going to help, or is it a lost cause, or what?

709
00:56:04,741 --> 00:56:05,901
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I don't know.

710
00:56:06,021 --> 00:56:10,783
[SPEAKER_21]: I have really yet to see a petition really, you know, like, make a difference in anything.

711
00:56:10,943 --> 00:56:11,183
[SPEAKER_21]: Right.

712
00:56:11,503 --> 00:56:17,285
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, I mean, last time I ever saw that was part of recall, but, you know, that's a whole different story altogether.

713
00:56:17,745 --> 00:56:19,826
[SPEAKER_21]: But, um, I think...

714
00:56:20,898 --> 00:56:29,962
[SPEAKER_21]: It's more or less, you really just got to support Bimani and you just got to, I mean, it doesn't hurt to drop a letter into customer service once in a while to Konami and say, yeah, we're really interested and all that kind of stuff.

715
00:56:30,042 --> 00:56:47,448
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, sure, when you write it off and send it off, you think, ah, no one's ever going to pay attention, but you'd be surprised when like, you know, it's as a product manager, I noticed for like any video game, you always got to keep your eyes and ears open because, you know, just like the slightest bit of, you know, idea or just, you know, hints or suggestions people have,

716
00:56:47,878 --> 00:56:50,659
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, fans have a lot more influence than they think.

717
00:56:50,819 --> 00:56:57,102
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, obviously, they're not going to make the game all by themselves, but I think you have to figure that kind of stuff.

718
00:56:57,202 --> 00:57:01,424
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, if you want to have a successful game, you want people to buy it, you give them what they want, by and far.

719
00:57:02,664 --> 00:57:03,224
[SPEAKER_23]: Very interesting.

720
00:57:04,225 --> 00:57:05,105
[SPEAKER_23]: Very cool.

721
00:57:05,425 --> 00:57:08,006
[SPEAKER_23]: Siggy, anything else you want to ask for 4.1?

722
00:57:08,506 --> 00:57:10,187
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only question I wanted to know.

723
00:57:10,407 --> 00:57:11,067
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, cool.

724
00:57:11,348 --> 00:57:12,448
[SPEAKER_23]: Looking forward to 8-Style Consumer?

725
00:57:15,458 --> 00:57:15,678
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

726
00:57:15,898 --> 00:57:16,159
[SPEAKER_23]: All right.

727
00:57:16,219 --> 00:57:20,121
[SPEAKER_23]: Call us back next week and let us know what you think because I'm too poor to get it, so I don't know if we're going to get to look at it.

728
00:57:20,161 --> 00:57:20,722
[SPEAKER_23]: Sure.

729
00:57:20,742 --> 00:57:21,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, guys.

730
00:57:21,502 --> 00:57:21,843
[SPEAKER_23]: All right.

731
00:57:21,863 --> 00:57:22,903
[SPEAKER_23]: Take it easy, man.

732
00:57:23,344 --> 00:57:23,644
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

733
00:57:23,904 --> 00:57:24,345
[SPEAKER_23]: Bye-bye.

734
00:57:25,585 --> 00:57:26,166
[SPEAKER_23]: Very good question.

735
00:57:26,186 --> 00:57:32,611
[SPEAKER_23]: I did not know that that kind of stuff was posted over on Bomani Style, but that's what I get for not being in the loop on the different forums.

736
00:57:33,231 --> 00:57:35,052
[SPEAKER_23]: So, interesting.

737
00:57:36,232 --> 00:57:39,878
[SPEAKER_23]: All right, let's get to that big announcement while we wait for another call to come in.

738
00:57:41,099 --> 00:57:49,932
[SPEAKER_23]: One interesting thing that was brought up on the show last week is that, hmm, is there a possibility that in the future that Orange Lounge Radio and DDR Freak Radio might get together and do something?

739
00:57:49,952 --> 00:57:51,214
[SPEAKER_23]: And the answer is yes.

740
00:57:53,033 --> 00:58:03,718
[SPEAKER_23]: Starting this Friday, you'll be able to catch the Orange Lounge Radio Rewind over on DDR Freak Radio.

741
00:58:03,858 --> 00:58:04,638
[SPEAKER_23]: That's the big announcement.

742
00:58:05,219 --> 00:58:12,042
[SPEAKER_23]: And if you've been paying attention to DDR Freak's site feedback forum, you'd already know that because it was announced earlier today, but that's alright.

743
00:58:13,442 --> 00:58:18,945
[SPEAKER_23]: But maybe you want to go over to that forum and let them know what great news it is to hear that we're going to be doing that.

744
00:58:19,665 --> 00:58:27,947
[SPEAKER_23]: Hopefully we'll be able to have a Gwana Girl on the show again and do more kinds of things to partner up with DDR Freak Radio and let them know that there's lots of love for internet radio stations.

745
00:58:28,307 --> 00:58:29,507
[SPEAKER_23]: There's plenty of love for all of us.

746
00:58:30,727 --> 00:58:31,387
[SPEAKER_23]: So that's exciting.

747
00:58:31,667 --> 00:58:32,508
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm really excited.

748
00:58:32,608 --> 00:58:40,209
[SPEAKER_23]: I think it'll help open up our show to a whole new audience over there and I think it's going to bring their radio station something different.

749
00:58:40,689 --> 00:58:44,330
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know if it's going to work out good for them because our show kind of sucks, but you know, no, I'm kidding.

750
00:58:45,430 --> 00:58:46,090
[SPEAKER_23]: Our show rocks.

751
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:47,151
[SPEAKER_23]: Listen to it every week.

752
00:58:48,231 --> 00:58:48,791
[SPEAKER_23]: What, Lanky Sound?

753
00:58:49,468 --> 00:58:52,710
[SPEAKER_25]: I said, yeah, you've got self-confidence.

754
00:58:52,810 --> 00:58:53,690
[SPEAKER_23]: Let me put it this way.

755
00:58:54,551 --> 00:58:57,412
[SPEAKER_23]: If I wasn't confident in this show, I would have stopped on episode three or four.

756
00:58:57,792 --> 00:58:58,513
[SPEAKER_23]: This is 118 now.

757
00:58:58,713 --> 00:59:04,075
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, how long were you playing DDR?

758
00:59:05,576 --> 00:59:05,856
[SPEAKER_25]: Shut up.

759
00:59:06,737 --> 00:59:07,037
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

760
00:59:07,477 --> 00:59:08,718
[SPEAKER_25]: How long were you playing DDR?

761
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:10,399
[SPEAKER_25]: Excuse me?

762
00:59:10,519 --> 00:59:10,719
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

763
00:59:10,919 --> 00:59:12,280
[SPEAKER_25]: Who was in Sacramento?

764
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:13,120
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, that's what I thought.

765
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:13,680
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, shut up.

766
00:59:14,141 --> 00:59:14,361
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

767
00:59:14,381 --> 00:59:14,361
1999. 1999.

768
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:21,828
[SPEAKER_23]: How are you doing over there, DarkSakura, by the way?

769
00:59:21,848 --> 00:59:23,648
[SPEAKER_23]: I haven't heard a lot from you tonight, which is rare.

770
00:59:24,048 --> 00:59:25,289
[SPEAKER_26]: I hate my nose.

771
00:59:25,989 --> 00:59:26,189
[SPEAKER_23]: Aww.

772
00:59:26,870 --> 00:59:27,790
[SPEAKER_23]: So did Michael Jackson.

773
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:31,271
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, but he had the money to go buy him a new one.

774
00:59:31,431 --> 00:59:34,132
[SPEAKER_26]: I need one that has completely dry sinuses.

775
00:59:34,172 --> 00:59:35,753
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, you just need new sinuses, though.

776
00:59:36,433 --> 00:59:37,034
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

777
00:59:37,054 --> 00:59:37,674
[SPEAKER_25]: Your nose is fine.

778
00:59:37,714 --> 00:59:39,815
[SPEAKER_26]: I think I'm getting high off of this Vic stuff, though.

779
00:59:39,995 --> 00:59:40,355
[SPEAKER_25]: Awesome.

780
00:59:41,535 --> 00:59:48,438
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm doing my homework, so... Yeah, I'm doing my homework on ethics in business and contracts.

781
00:59:49,284 --> 00:59:50,145
[SPEAKER_26]: It's very boring.

782
00:59:50,365 --> 00:59:51,066
[SPEAKER_23]: Fascinating.

783
00:59:52,188 --> 00:59:54,330
[SPEAKER_23]: Very, very fascinating.

784
00:59:54,631 --> 00:59:56,072
[SPEAKER_26]: By fascinating, you mean boring.

785
00:59:56,133 --> 00:59:56,954
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, it is.

786
00:59:57,715 --> 01:00:02,761
[SPEAKER_23]: To answer some questions from the chat room about the whole DDR Freak Radio syndication, it's going to be 6 p.m.

787
01:00:03,101 --> 01:00:05,284
[SPEAKER_23]: Pacific time on Friday.

788
01:00:05,544 --> 01:00:06,105
[SPEAKER_23]: That's awesome.

789
01:00:06,245 --> 01:00:07,046
[SPEAKER_23]: On DDR Freak Radio.

790
01:00:07,066 --> 01:00:07,587
[SPEAKER_23]: I'll be at work.

791
01:00:08,956 --> 01:00:10,818
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, tune in from work.

792
01:00:10,878 --> 01:00:11,718
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know what to tell you.

793
01:00:11,738 --> 01:00:13,620
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, that's a good idea.

794
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:14,421
[SPEAKER_23]: I have to try that.

795
01:00:14,501 --> 01:00:15,161
[SPEAKER_23]: You should try that.

796
01:00:15,181 --> 01:00:15,622
[SPEAKER_23]: There you go.

797
01:00:16,502 --> 01:00:21,947
[SPEAKER_23]: And just so you know, the Wednesday rewinds here on Orange Lounge Radio, they're going to change a little bit.

798
01:00:21,987 --> 01:00:30,635
[SPEAKER_23]: Since we have our rewinds over on DDR Freak Radio now, we're going to bring you classic and moldy episodes of Orange Lounge Radio that are freshly fermented.

799
01:00:30,895 --> 01:00:33,557
[SPEAKER_23]: So, like, year-old episodes we're going to start bringing you on Wednesday nights.

800
01:00:33,577 --> 01:00:34,558
[SPEAKER_23]: Like, old stuff, so...

801
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:37,261
[SPEAKER_23]: That'll be the little change there.

802
01:00:37,321 --> 01:00:38,403
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, we are getting another call.

803
01:00:39,144 --> 01:00:40,906
[SPEAKER_23]: I need to pay attention to the Skype line once in a while.

804
01:00:40,946 --> 01:00:42,748
[SPEAKER_23]: Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

805
01:00:44,991 --> 01:00:46,253
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, Legend of Zaku here.

806
01:00:46,754 --> 01:00:47,755
[SPEAKER_23]: Hi, Zaku, how you doing?

807
01:00:49,662 --> 01:00:54,964
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, let me add a counterstatement to what they said about American 2DX release.

808
01:00:55,204 --> 01:00:55,584
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

809
01:00:55,984 --> 01:01:10,288
[SPEAKER_20]: Seeing as, you know, going on the basis of the last presidential election and the fact that a vast majority of this country is red, and I want to follow up on that word just to keep it there.

810
01:01:10,348 --> 01:01:10,988
[SPEAKER_20]: Wait, wait, wait.

811
01:01:11,328 --> 01:01:14,509
[SPEAKER_23]: Wouldn't that mean that 2DX Red might have some success here?

812
01:01:14,769 --> 01:01:15,849
[SPEAKER_20]: No, I didn't mean that.

813
01:01:16,230 --> 01:01:17,430
[SPEAKER_20]: What I meant is the red states.

814
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:32,924
[SPEAKER_20]: In particular, the fact that you're releasing a seven key game with a turntable and the fact that it's going really fast and it's going to, you know, I don't know if we're prepared for the attention span that it will, because that will demand a lot.

815
01:01:33,544 --> 01:01:38,726
[SPEAKER_20]: Especially from Americans who are Alright, Mel's got his hand up.

816
01:01:38,766 --> 01:01:39,526
[SPEAKER_21]: Mel's got his hand up.

817
01:01:39,986 --> 01:01:46,288
[SPEAKER_21]: And I suppose that's why Omaha, of all places, got 2DX Red before everyone else in America.

818
01:01:46,728 --> 01:01:47,268
[SPEAKER_21]: Whom?

819
01:01:48,308 --> 01:01:49,409
[SPEAKER_20]: Hey, I live in New York.

820
01:01:49,429 --> 01:01:50,809
[SPEAKER_20]: Hey, I live in New York.

821
01:01:50,849 --> 01:01:52,570
[SPEAKER_20]: We're lucky my state has a 9-star.

822
01:01:53,590 --> 01:01:56,331
[SPEAKER_24]: And the only 9-star on the East Coast is my dad.

823
01:01:56,411 --> 01:01:59,853
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry, were you saying something?

824
01:02:01,213 --> 01:02:03,674
[SPEAKER_20]: Basically, let me put it this way.

825
01:02:06,252 --> 01:02:08,652
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know if 2DX will sell here.

826
01:02:08,872 --> 01:02:10,073
[SPEAKER_23]: Let me sum it up.

827
01:02:10,153 --> 01:02:19,856
[SPEAKER_23]: You're saying that basically, and your tangent to the election aside, ignoring all that, basically what you're saying in a nutshell is that America is too stupid for 2DX.

828
01:02:20,596 --> 01:02:21,036
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know.

829
01:02:21,116 --> 01:02:21,516
[SPEAKER_20]: Maybe.

830
01:02:21,596 --> 01:02:22,717
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not sure.

831
01:02:23,057 --> 01:02:27,158
[SPEAKER_25]: What you're mainly saying is that people who vote for somebody you don't agree with are stupid.

832
01:02:27,198 --> 01:02:28,859
[SPEAKER_20]: No, no, no.

833
01:02:28,879 --> 01:02:30,919
[SPEAKER_20]: You're misunderstanding my point.

834
01:02:31,199 --> 01:02:32,460
[SPEAKER_20]: You're misunderstanding me right now.

835
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:32,960
[SPEAKER_20]: Look, listen.

836
01:02:33,717 --> 01:02:43,900
[SPEAKER_20]: What I'm trying to say is that in a video game country, you know, in a country where basically the vast majority of video games are like what?

837
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:47,061
[SPEAKER_20]: Right now it's mostly, you know, Halo.

838
01:02:48,482 --> 01:02:52,883
[SPEAKER_20]: It's like first person shooting sports and fighting games.

839
01:02:53,543 --> 01:02:54,844
[SPEAKER_20]: Dancing games is up there.

840
01:02:54,904 --> 01:02:55,764
[SPEAKER_20]: It makes them, you know.

841
01:02:56,812 --> 01:03:17,083
[SPEAKER_20]: Make some highlights and a few, and took the limelight a little bit, but you're talking about something that, you know, I don't know, I mean, certain games, the same way that DDR supposedly came here, because it wasn't, it didn't plan this to arrive, it only came with a, it only came with like a few thousand copies, thinking that it wasn't going to sell, because of the cultural differences.

842
01:03:17,463 --> 01:03:18,343
[SPEAKER_20]: That's what I'm trying to say.

843
01:03:18,764 --> 01:03:21,125
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, you know what, that sounds very familiar.

844
01:03:21,690 --> 01:03:25,534
[SPEAKER_21]: You actually sound like the president of Konami around circa 2000.

845
01:03:26,635 --> 01:03:31,159
[SPEAKER_21]: This is when Jason Neils had bought for about three years to get DDR in America.

846
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:37,885
[SPEAKER_21]: Somehow Jason had begged and clawed and did everything in his power to get DDR released into America.

847
01:03:38,306 --> 01:03:42,570
[SPEAKER_21]: The president only made them press about 20,000 copies or so.

848
01:03:42,870 --> 01:03:43,531
[SPEAKER_21]: He was absolutely

849
01:03:44,011 --> 01:03:44,652
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you for watching!

850
01:04:02,472 --> 01:04:21,160
[SPEAKER_21]: and that's not even counting the ones with like a bundle so and remember this is at a time when music games did not have nearly as much fanfare as it does now I mean now that not only do you have Konami but you know you had like people from harmonics that did frequency amplitude now you know karaoke revolution that you got the MTV you know so I'm just saying you know I mean it's legitimate

851
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:25,737
[SPEAKER_21]: I can understand why there's only two forms of Bomani here, DDR and Karaoke Revolution.

852
01:04:43,331 --> 01:04:47,775
[SPEAKER_20]: Added a third and tried to expand gradually from what's already there in Japan.

853
01:04:47,815 --> 01:04:48,455
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not sure.

854
01:04:48,616 --> 01:04:51,458
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, I know both did well.

855
01:04:51,698 --> 01:04:52,039
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know.

856
01:04:52,099 --> 01:05:02,948
[SPEAKER_20]: It's kind of like, in a sense, it might be a slippery slope on one side, but as long as fans can back it up and regular people can learn how to be tolerant and embrace it,

857
01:05:03,547 --> 01:05:06,809
[SPEAKER_20]: and there's a good chance he'll sell and make a repeat of the last two.

858
01:05:07,049 --> 01:05:09,690
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright, the bottom line is, if it came out, you'd buy it, right?

859
01:05:10,391 --> 01:05:11,371
[SPEAKER_20]: I would buy it, no doubt.

860
01:05:11,471 --> 01:05:12,432
[SPEAKER_23]: At least the support would be there.

861
01:05:12,692 --> 01:05:15,213
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright, we gotta move on, but thank you for calling, Zaku.

862
01:05:15,814 --> 01:05:16,294
[SPEAKER_23]: Have a good one.

863
01:05:16,714 --> 01:05:18,155
[SPEAKER_25]: I just want to make a really quick comment.

864
01:05:18,195 --> 01:05:19,295
[SPEAKER_23]: Very interesting perspective.

865
01:05:19,636 --> 01:05:20,956
[SPEAKER_25]: I want to make a really quick comment.

866
01:05:21,116 --> 01:05:26,399
[SPEAKER_25]: A lot of games in Japan never come here because people think we're not going to get it.

867
01:05:26,439 --> 01:05:28,060
[SPEAKER_25]: There's just too many cultural differences.

868
01:05:28,843 --> 01:05:57,304
[SPEAKER_25]: Look at games like Katamari Damashii I was just thinking the same thing Animal Crossing, Katamari Damashii Incredible Crisis didn't sell incredibly But it was pretty tough to find It had a following Even Bust a Move That was like right around the same time DDR first came out When the first Bust a Move game came out The first Bust a Move had been out I had the second one before the first one came out

869
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:01,022
[SPEAKER_21]: And essentially, like, all that stuff becomes cult hits.

870
01:06:01,082 --> 01:06:04,884
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, like, Parappa was, you know, first Japan, if I'm not mistaken, or whatever.

871
01:06:04,904 --> 01:06:13,410
[SPEAKER_21]: And then, yeah, it came out here, and it sold about, like, 30,000, 40,000 units, which, essentially, in the game industry, 25,000 is considered, like, a cult hit.

872
01:06:13,490 --> 01:06:23,837
[SPEAKER_21]: So, you know, and just like DDR, the minute you get a cult following, you know, if the game is good enough and has staying power and you have enough fans that back it, it's going to blow up eventually.

873
01:06:23,897 --> 01:06:25,378
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, it will run its course.

874
01:06:26,929 --> 01:06:30,313
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, and it's just... That's usually how they all start.

875
01:06:30,333 --> 01:06:33,657
[SPEAKER_25]: Whenever something new comes out, it's a quote-unquote cult hit.

876
01:06:34,098 --> 01:06:41,486
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, this is maybe... People are going to probably bash me for saying this, but first-person shooters didn't used to be the most popular game in the world.

877
01:06:42,087 --> 01:06:45,932
[SPEAKER_25]: But then ever since, you know, Doom came out, just it started going...

878
01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:47,119
[SPEAKER_25]: and so on.

879
01:07:03,508 --> 01:07:06,992
[SPEAKER_23]: I think, you know what though, Saku does bring up an interesting perspective.

880
01:07:07,072 --> 01:07:17,544
[SPEAKER_23]: I think what basically he's saying and how Mel makes the comparison where, you know, this was the same reservations that Konami had about DDR several years ago is that people wouldn't get it.

881
01:07:17,904 --> 01:07:19,726
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, they're just having those same concerns all over again.

882
01:07:19,767 --> 01:07:22,109
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't think that comes as a surprise to any of us, basically.

883
01:07:23,270 --> 01:07:27,471
[SPEAKER_25]: I think with a good marketing campaign, I think it would definitely move.

884
01:07:27,491 --> 01:07:31,653
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, I think a lot of it has to do with what is 2DX's niche, too?

885
01:07:31,873 --> 01:07:35,834
[SPEAKER_23]: Like, you know, DDR makes you lose your butt a little bit, right?

886
01:07:36,014 --> 01:07:38,294
[SPEAKER_25]: And then 2DX is just fans of music.

887
01:07:38,655 --> 01:07:42,536
[SPEAKER_25]: People who like the feeling that they're creating a song, but with no talent.

888
01:07:42,616 --> 01:07:43,016
[SPEAKER_25]: No, just kidding.

889
01:07:43,356 --> 01:07:44,016
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm just kidding.

890
01:07:44,456 --> 01:07:45,096
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm just kidding.

891
01:07:45,877 --> 01:07:50,338
[SPEAKER_25]: There's a lot of people out there who play 2DX that are extremely talented, but it's easier to make...

892
01:07:51,084 --> 01:07:52,205
[SPEAKER_25]: The music, you could say.

893
01:07:52,525 --> 01:07:56,846
[SPEAKER_25]: Playing 2DX, then actually going and producing music from the ground up.

894
01:07:57,287 --> 01:07:59,728
[SPEAKER_25]: And I get, everybody, I think, gets that feeling.

895
01:07:59,808 --> 01:08:10,572
[SPEAKER_25]: I remember the first time I ever played Hip Hop Mania, Complete Mix 1, when it first came out in America, way back in the day, and I played, you know, was it Believe Again or something like really old?

896
01:08:10,932 --> 01:08:13,133
[SPEAKER_25]: I was just like, I feel like I'm making music.

897
01:08:13,173 --> 01:08:17,135
[SPEAKER_25]: I press a key, and then I press the key again, and this turntable's cool.

898
01:08:17,455 --> 01:08:19,116
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, and I love music.

899
01:08:19,136 --> 01:08:20,116
[SPEAKER_25]: I've grown up

900
01:08:20,452 --> 01:08:23,014
[SPEAKER_25]: I've grown up loving music and I still love music.

901
01:08:23,034 --> 01:08:32,881
[SPEAKER_25]: I think a lot of, you know, obviously a lot of people love music, so I think that, you know, you just point at these things in a sales campaign or something and, you know, sell it off as music.

902
01:08:32,941 --> 01:08:49,214
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, I just kind of hope that the success of Donkey Kongo, which I believe has been a fairly successful game so far, Taiko No... I'm sorry, Taiko Drum Master, Taiko no Tachigen in Japan, a little early to tell, I think, with that one so far, if it's been successful or not, but hopefully if these games that come bundled with peripherals are somewhat successful...

903
01:08:49,674 --> 01:08:55,336
[SPEAKER_23]: Hopefully, maybe Konami will go, okay, maybe America feels a little different about peripherals now.

904
01:08:55,396 --> 01:08:59,497
[SPEAKER_23]: Because I think a long time ago it was kind of like, peripherals don't do well here.

905
01:08:59,618 --> 01:09:06,260
[SPEAKER_23]: Super Scope, Power Pad, you know, everything pretty much, Tank, U-Force, Power Glove.

906
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:10,181
[SPEAKER_25]: How much is an official Konami dance pad right now?

907
01:09:10,741 --> 01:09:11,202
[SPEAKER_25]: Still about 50 bucks?

908
01:09:11,222 --> 01:09:12,502
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know if you can find one.

909
01:09:14,238 --> 01:09:17,759
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, to get an official Konami pad, you'd have to buy a bundle, usually.

910
01:09:17,940 --> 01:09:21,961
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, if you go to, like, some, like, store like, say, Toys and Joys, yeah, you can probably get for, like, $30, $40.

911
01:09:22,761 --> 01:09:26,623
[SPEAKER_21]: But the bundle, I think they run about somewhere around $79 to $80.

912
01:09:27,043 --> 01:09:30,485
[SPEAKER_23]: I believe they are selling an Ultramix 2 bundle on Amazon right now for $59.99.

913
01:09:30,685 --> 01:09:38,168
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, so what I'm saying is that when the Konami pads officially came out originally, they were over $50 a piece.

914
01:09:39,523 --> 01:09:43,265
[SPEAKER_25]: to import them before they came out here, they were usually like 70-something bucks a piece.

915
01:09:44,326 --> 01:09:47,147
[SPEAKER_25]: Obviously, the price has dropped, you know, substantially.

916
01:09:47,367 --> 01:09:51,669
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, Mad Catz had a lot to do with that, too, with their, you know, bargain basement dance pads.

917
01:09:51,689 --> 01:09:55,671
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, no, I'm talking about official pads that are actually quality-made pads.

918
01:09:56,252 --> 01:10:00,994
[SPEAKER_25]: And, you know, I think the same could be done with Konami controller.

919
01:10:01,034 --> 01:10:02,415
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, ever since the 2DX...

920
01:10:03,331 --> 01:10:05,392
[SPEAKER_25]: official Konami controller, not the arcade style.

921
01:10:05,832 --> 01:10:07,372
[SPEAKER_25]: Ever since they came out, they've been around $100.

922
01:10:08,352 --> 01:10:09,953
[SPEAKER_25]: And they still are around $100.

923
01:10:10,693 --> 01:10:15,614
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm sure they could work something out, or they could drop the price a little bit for an American release.

924
01:10:15,894 --> 01:10:18,155
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, Sony does it all the time.

925
01:10:18,975 --> 01:10:23,296
[SPEAKER_25]: Maybe Konami could outsource a company to make a quality controller.

926
01:10:23,936 --> 01:10:25,157
[SPEAKER_22]: That'd be interesting.

927
01:10:25,697 --> 01:10:29,698
[SPEAKER_25]: And take a little bit of loss for a little while until the game gets, who knows, maybe...

928
01:10:30,741 --> 01:10:31,702
[SPEAKER_25]: Sony makes peripherals.

929
01:10:31,742 --> 01:10:32,542
[SPEAKER_25]: Why can't Sony do it?

930
01:10:32,983 --> 01:10:33,503
[SPEAKER_25]: They got money.

931
01:10:34,564 --> 01:10:36,845
[SPEAKER_23]: So, in other words, Konami, if you're listening, just take a chance.

932
01:10:37,926 --> 01:10:38,406
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, my God.

933
01:10:38,426 --> 01:10:39,227
[SPEAKER_23]: Take a chance on me.

934
01:10:39,247 --> 01:10:39,807
[SPEAKER_23]: No, stop it.

935
01:10:39,827 --> 01:10:40,327
[SPEAKER_23]: No ABBA.

936
01:10:40,347 --> 01:10:41,088
[SPEAKER_25]: Take a chance.

937
01:10:41,208 --> 01:10:42,649
[SPEAKER_25]: Is there ABBA in DDR?

938
01:10:43,449 --> 01:10:44,430
[SPEAKER_25]: Not yet.

939
01:10:44,590 --> 01:10:45,691
[SPEAKER_25]: Then don't bring it up.

940
01:10:45,711 --> 01:10:48,072
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

941
01:10:49,969 --> 01:10:57,355
[SPEAKER_21]: As long as ASCII does not make a 7-key one, ASCII is probably the worst 5-key controller ever made.

942
01:10:57,875 --> 01:11:00,898
[SPEAKER_25]: Wait, is that the same company that made the ASCII pad for the Super Nintendo?

943
01:11:02,459 --> 01:11:03,340
[SPEAKER_21]: Probably.

944
01:11:04,020 --> 01:11:08,224
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, that was, I think, at the time, the greatest controller ever made, so what the fuck happened to them?

945
01:11:10,054 --> 01:11:10,514
[SPEAKER_23]: Management.

946
01:11:10,594 --> 01:11:10,895
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know.

947
01:11:11,115 --> 01:11:11,475
[SPEAKER_23]: All right.

948
01:11:11,515 --> 01:11:11,795
[SPEAKER_23]: Maybe.

949
01:11:12,356 --> 01:11:12,576
[SPEAKER_23]: All right.

950
01:11:12,596 --> 01:11:13,337
[SPEAKER_23]: We're going to go to a break.

951
01:11:13,357 --> 01:11:15,598
[SPEAKER_23]: We got some more Ultramix 2 songs we're going to play for you guys.

952
01:11:16,039 --> 01:11:19,341
[SPEAKER_23]: This next one, it's actually a really long one, so we're going to kind of shorten it a little bit.

953
01:11:19,421 --> 01:11:21,022
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm going to kind of start it here in the middle for you guys.

954
01:11:21,323 --> 01:11:22,664
[SPEAKER_23]: It's a group called Creo.

955
01:11:23,564 --> 01:11:24,585
[SPEAKER_23]: I think I pronounced that right.

956
01:11:24,645 --> 01:11:25,045
[SPEAKER_23]: Creo?

957
01:11:26,146 --> 01:11:26,627
[SPEAKER_23]: Close enough.

958
01:11:26,827 --> 01:11:27,707
[SPEAKER_23]: It's K-R-E-O.

959
01:11:27,767 --> 01:11:28,148
[SPEAKER_23]: Creo.

960
01:11:28,888 --> 01:11:30,790
[SPEAKER_23]: Or if you said it backwards, it would be Orek.

961
01:11:31,390 --> 01:11:31,670
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know.

962
01:11:31,951 --> 01:11:34,112
[SPEAKER_23]: Anyway, the song is called Burn For You.

963
01:11:34,733 --> 01:11:36,534
[SPEAKER_23]: And this is a new song that's going to be on Ultramix 2.

964
01:11:37,034 --> 01:11:38,916
[SPEAKER_23]: And don't play this at your local clinic.

965
01:11:40,171 --> 01:11:41,477
[SPEAKER_21]: It might be a bad sign.

966
01:12:48,018 --> 01:12:49,328
Thank you for watching!

967
01:13:43,482 --> 01:13:46,087
Let me tell you something you don't know

968
01:14:42,135 --> 01:14:44,990
[SPEAKER_11]: Tell you something you don't know

969
01:16:49,410 --> 01:17:02,501
[SPEAKER_23]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio Starting the Eurobeat party apparently, no, sorry about that That's what happens when I have things on repeat, it shouldn't be Initial D Initial D

970
01:17:04,131 --> 01:17:06,492
[SPEAKER_23]: We are back here on episode number 118.

971
01:17:06,952 --> 01:17:08,152
[SPEAKER_23]: What are you boys talking about over there?

972
01:17:08,172 --> 01:17:09,732
[SPEAKER_23]: What are you boys talking about back there?

973
01:17:09,892 --> 01:17:12,753
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, we're gushing over the Rumble Roses soundtrack.

974
01:17:12,953 --> 01:17:13,313
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, you're right.

975
01:17:13,333 --> 01:17:14,293
[SPEAKER_15]: We're talking about boobs.

976
01:17:16,114 --> 01:17:18,814
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, it's kind of relevant because the game comes out this week here, so.

977
01:17:18,954 --> 01:17:20,795
[SPEAKER_25]: I thought it just came out on like Friday or something.

978
01:17:20,815 --> 01:17:21,035
[SPEAKER_22]: Did it?

979
01:17:21,175 --> 01:17:21,895
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I heard it came out.

980
01:17:22,275 --> 01:17:23,035
[SPEAKER_25]: Hmm, okay.

981
01:17:23,475 --> 01:17:25,796
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, I just know that this week I've got to go pick up a few games, so.

982
01:17:27,356 --> 01:17:28,236
[SPEAKER_25]: Am I coming through on the mic?

983
01:17:28,256 --> 01:17:29,036
[SPEAKER_25]: Do you have money for that?

984
01:17:30,037 --> 01:17:30,957
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, I got a little money.

985
01:17:31,277 --> 01:17:31,897
[SPEAKER_25]: Just teasing you.

986
01:17:33,305 --> 01:17:34,046
[SPEAKER_25]: Can you check the levels?

987
01:17:34,106 --> 01:17:34,666
[SPEAKER_25]: Am I coming through?

988
01:17:34,686 --> 01:17:35,847
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, you're coming through.

989
01:17:36,067 --> 01:17:36,768
[SPEAKER_23]: I can hear you.

990
01:17:36,788 --> 01:17:40,911
[SPEAKER_23]: That's why I have these big space-age headphones on, so I can hear if the microphones are coming through okay.

991
01:17:40,951 --> 01:17:42,432
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, now you look like a real DJ.

992
01:17:42,652 --> 01:17:43,052
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, I know.

993
01:17:43,672 --> 01:17:45,313
[SPEAKER_23]: This is the coolest system I'm ever going to get to the real thing.

994
01:17:45,414 --> 01:17:47,075
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, you've got the headphones on.

995
01:17:47,915 --> 01:17:49,776
[SPEAKER_25]: You're not particularly attractive.

996
01:17:49,796 --> 01:17:51,257
[SPEAKER_25]: Just kidding.

997
01:17:51,878 --> 01:17:53,339
[SPEAKER_25]: I've got two turntables and a microphone.

998
01:17:53,599 --> 01:17:54,039
[SPEAKER_25]: Uh-huh.

999
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:55,480
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, Beck.

1000
01:17:55,820 --> 01:17:57,842
[SPEAKER_25]: Where it's at, huh?

1001
01:17:58,202 --> 01:18:00,003
[SPEAKER_25]: No, but... Continue.

1002
01:18:00,564 --> 01:18:00,924
[SPEAKER_25]: Continue.

1003
01:18:01,741 --> 01:18:02,822
[SPEAKER_25]: On to your topic, if you have one.

1004
01:18:02,862 --> 01:18:04,964
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, I was going to say Rumble Roses, but that's alright.

1005
01:18:06,065 --> 01:18:08,206
[SPEAKER_23]: You were talking to Mel about the voice acting, right?

1006
01:18:08,386 --> 01:18:08,747
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, yeah.

1007
01:18:08,807 --> 01:18:13,951
[SPEAKER_25]: I was just asking if I ever asked him about the voice acting, if there was anything up with it.

1008
01:18:14,131 --> 01:18:16,793
[SPEAKER_23]: I mentioned it last week, but I couldn't remember it quite like you can.

1009
01:18:17,114 --> 01:18:17,354
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

1010
01:18:17,574 --> 01:18:21,877
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, no, I just was explaining to him, and I'm assuming it's not the game itself.

1011
01:18:22,418 --> 01:18:23,859
[SPEAKER_25]: I doubt Konami would release a game with

1012
01:18:24,682 --> 01:18:31,988
[SPEAKER_25]: Seriously mismatched speech to the lip syncing, because it was like, in the videos I had, the voices were coming out of the wrong people.

1013
01:18:32,588 --> 01:18:39,314
[SPEAKER_25]: So I'm assuming it was just because somebody was skipping, whoever was playing over at IGN was skipping through dialogue, and it, you know, you know how it is.

1014
01:18:41,115 --> 01:18:45,938
[SPEAKER_21]: And by the way, don't blame us people over in the U.S.

1015
01:18:45,998 --> 01:18:48,239
[SPEAKER_21]: for the horrible dialogue within the game.

1016
01:18:48,279 --> 01:18:51,161
[SPEAKER_21]: We were only given one day to rewrite all that stuff.

1017
01:18:51,241 --> 01:18:56,064
[SPEAKER_21]: So even the producer admitted as much after we did some damage control.

1018
01:18:56,084 --> 01:18:57,905
[SPEAKER_21]: He said we should have been writing from the get-go.

1019
01:18:58,786 --> 01:19:03,408
[SPEAKER_23]: You know what's interesting, though, is that a lot of the earlier reviews of Rumble Roses have good things to say about the music.

1020
01:19:03,448 --> 01:19:04,389
[SPEAKER_23]: Very good things to say about the music.

1021
01:19:04,509 --> 01:19:09,172
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, a lot of people I've been reading the reviews have been saying it's just a good game all around.

1022
01:19:09,915 --> 01:19:14,078
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, I think, you know, the chicks thing has a big thing to do with that.

1023
01:19:14,118 --> 01:19:15,399
[SPEAKER_25]: But hey, it looks like a great game.

1024
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:22,425
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I think what Rumble Roses has best going for it is the fact that, I mean, you capture a lot of things that wrestling people like.

1025
01:19:22,485 --> 01:19:31,892
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, they like wrestling and most, um, the wrestling, they use the engine from Yuke's, which was the one that's been used for SmackDown for the past couple of seasons.

1026
01:19:32,272 --> 01:19:37,156
[SPEAKER_21]: So the people who buy the game have something they're already familiar with as far as gameplay.

1027
01:19:37,176 --> 01:19:39,638
[SPEAKER_21]: And then, of course, it's, you know, the

1028
01:19:41,121 --> 01:19:42,662
[SPEAKER_21]: 100,000 megapixels or whatever, you know.

1029
01:19:42,942 --> 01:19:48,226
[SPEAKER_21]: So the characters are very detailed and, you know, they've got an engine for jiggling and all that kind of stuff.

1030
01:19:48,686 --> 01:19:52,248
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm thinking, you know, so it's, I mean, what's not to like?

1031
01:19:52,288 --> 01:19:52,968
[SPEAKER_21]: Visually great?

1032
01:19:53,128 --> 01:19:53,909
[SPEAKER_21]: Gameplay great?

1033
01:19:54,229 --> 01:19:59,472
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, if you don't like wrestling, I mean, then... Well, wait a minute, that's the weird thing.

1034
01:19:59,752 --> 01:20:02,954
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't like chicks and I don't like wrestling, yet I'm interested in this game.

1035
01:20:02,974 --> 01:20:03,975
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, wait, wait, wait.

1036
01:20:04,375 --> 01:20:05,696
[SPEAKER_23]: That's because you're gay.

1037
01:20:08,192 --> 01:20:13,077
[SPEAKER_25]: and... No, no, no, that's the reason why you're interested because you wish you could be as hot as these girls.

1038
01:20:13,818 --> 01:20:15,780
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, yeah, I wish I could be hot.

1039
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:16,961
[SPEAKER_25]: Anyway, no, um...

1040
01:20:18,049 --> 01:20:19,490
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, blanket statement aside.

1041
01:20:19,570 --> 01:20:25,773
[SPEAKER_25]: Anyway, here's just kind of a little joke, but on a serious note, kind of, I don't know.

1042
01:20:25,893 --> 01:20:26,974
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, no, not any serious, just a joke.

1043
01:20:27,674 --> 01:20:30,476
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, it's got the whole engine for jiggling and stuff.

1044
01:20:30,496 --> 01:20:36,019
[SPEAKER_25]: You're not necessarily a boob guy, which you're weird if you aren't, but you're more an ass guy.

1045
01:20:36,339 --> 01:20:38,960
[SPEAKER_25]: They got some pretty good accurate ass jiggling, too.

1046
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:42,102
[SPEAKER_23]: I would say I'm more of an ass guy, and I still don't care.

1047
01:20:44,043 --> 01:20:45,544
[SPEAKER_23]: And again, you're gay.

1048
01:20:49,209 --> 01:20:49,790
[SPEAKER_25]: What the hell?

1049
01:20:50,170 --> 01:20:51,131
[SPEAKER_25]: What are you saying, Miklo?

1050
01:20:51,611 --> 01:20:52,492
[SPEAKER_25]: You saying I'm wrong?

1051
01:20:52,632 --> 01:20:53,373
[SPEAKER_25]: What am I wrong about?

1052
01:20:54,313 --> 01:20:57,897
[SPEAKER_23]: Anyway, so anyway, about the voice acting, what?

1053
01:20:57,917 --> 01:20:58,457
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, thank you.

1054
01:20:58,477 --> 01:21:04,382
[SPEAKER_23]: The voice of reason, one of our females in the showroom, DDArcoholic says, when will the games with the gyrating penis come out?

1055
01:21:04,702 --> 01:21:07,505
[SPEAKER_23]: I want to know when my Thunder Down Under wrestling game comes out.

1056
01:21:08,531 --> 01:21:12,834
[SPEAKER_24]: If you want giant gyrating penis, that would have been in Katamari Dimash.

1057
01:21:12,874 --> 01:21:14,715
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

1058
01:21:15,735 --> 01:21:22,179
[SPEAKER_25]: Actually, no, there's a series of games in Japan that are shooters, that all the characters... Shooter games.

1059
01:21:24,980 --> 01:21:27,462
[SPEAKER_25]: Floorwalk is grabbing his testicles, he's like, oh no!

1060
01:21:28,102 --> 01:21:35,927
[SPEAKER_25]: No, not that kind of shit, like a side-scrolling shooter game, that are... The characters, your ship or whatever, is like a...

1061
01:21:37,188 --> 01:21:41,191
[SPEAKER_25]: I know, I said blanket statement aside, obviously I wasn't serious.

1062
01:22:06,684 --> 01:22:07,845
[SPEAKER_25]: But I am with you, Miklatov.

1063
01:22:07,966 --> 01:22:08,907
[SPEAKER_25]: Just kidding.

1064
01:22:09,868 --> 01:22:10,809
[SPEAKER_25]: It was fun to punch you anyway.

1065
01:22:12,411 --> 01:22:13,712
[SPEAKER_26]: I do not bring a Bunga Bunga.

1066
01:22:13,732 --> 01:22:18,378
[SPEAKER_26]: We do not need finger to the ass action here.

1067
01:22:20,582 --> 01:22:20,922
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, man.

1068
01:22:20,942 --> 01:22:22,783
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, not that kind of ass.

1069
01:22:22,863 --> 01:22:30,044
[SPEAKER_25]: Anyway, um, I just thought I'd let you know, because, you know, girls always say this, when do we get our guys, our hot guys in games?

1070
01:22:30,424 --> 01:22:32,745
[SPEAKER_25]: Hot guys in games has been around since games came out.

1071
01:22:33,385 --> 01:22:33,705
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay?

1072
01:22:34,445 --> 01:22:41,066
[SPEAKER_25]: They've been putting artwork on old arcade games with big, muscly men, and they still put hot guys, quote-unquote, in video games nowadays.

1073
01:22:41,086 --> 01:22:42,307
[SPEAKER_26]: Like, Karnov?

1074
01:22:42,627 --> 01:22:42,987
[SPEAKER_25]: What's that?

1075
01:22:43,007 --> 01:22:44,487
[SPEAKER_26]: Wait, what?

1076
01:22:44,547 --> 01:22:46,487
[SPEAKER_26]: I can play with John Cena at home, so I'm happy.

1077
01:22:46,668 --> 01:22:47,588
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know who John Cena is.

1078
01:22:47,628 --> 01:22:48,608
[SPEAKER_24]: How about this is a weird...

1079
01:22:49,148 --> 01:22:51,309
[SPEAKER_24]: Hey, hey, how about this is a weird game right here.

1080
01:22:52,289 --> 01:22:53,570
[SPEAKER_24]: Miniskirt Police.

1081
01:22:56,411 --> 01:22:58,452
[SPEAKER_25]: Wait, did you surf for weird games like Google?

1082
01:22:58,632 --> 01:22:58,892
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

1083
01:23:00,092 --> 01:23:00,412
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

1084
01:23:00,472 --> 01:23:01,433
[SPEAKER_24]: Miniskirt Police.

1085
01:23:01,713 --> 01:23:05,654
[SPEAKER_24]: It's a light gun game where I guess you take pictures of women in miniskirts.

1086
01:23:06,995 --> 01:23:07,595
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

1087
01:23:07,635 --> 01:23:08,596
[SPEAKER_24]: That's a Namco thing.

1088
01:23:08,736 --> 01:23:09,456
[SPEAKER_24]: Go Namco.

1089
01:23:09,636 --> 01:23:09,976
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, yeah.

1090
01:23:10,276 --> 01:23:11,076
[SPEAKER_24]: There's Namco for you.

1091
01:23:11,897 --> 01:23:12,277
[SPEAKER_25]: Interesting.

1092
01:23:13,657 --> 01:23:15,858
[SPEAKER_25]: They should have a motion capture version of that.

1093
01:23:16,218 --> 01:23:17,539
[SPEAKER_25]: MoCap Miniskirt Police.

1094
01:23:19,369 --> 01:23:21,711
[SPEAKER_25]: and you need a partner to play with in a miniskirt.

1095
01:23:22,351 --> 01:23:23,172
[SPEAKER_25]: So it's not really a game.

1096
01:23:23,472 --> 01:23:24,573
[SPEAKER_25]: It's just, yeah, anyway.

1097
01:23:26,234 --> 01:23:29,677
[SPEAKER_26]: So... Hey, don't knock the Japanese games, though, because they brought us Radiant Silvergun.

1098
01:23:30,097 --> 01:23:30,437
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, yes.

1099
01:23:30,657 --> 01:23:31,418
[SPEAKER_25]: Which I've got to play.

1100
01:23:31,478 --> 01:23:33,559
[SPEAKER_25]: In an awesome spin-off called Ikaruga.

1101
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:39,163
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, but I got to play Radiant Silvergun Arcade Machine and that makes me feel special for the rest of my life.

1102
01:23:39,944 --> 01:23:43,927
[SPEAKER_26]: On the now-vanished game land in Vegas.

1103
01:23:44,522 --> 01:23:45,363
[SPEAKER_25]: Ooh, cool.

1104
01:23:46,484 --> 01:23:47,445
[SPEAKER_25]: Radiant Silvergun is pretty.

1105
01:23:47,625 --> 01:23:47,865
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

1106
01:23:49,206 --> 01:23:50,067
[SPEAKER_23]: Go on, Rob.

1107
01:23:50,287 --> 01:23:50,747
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, hell.

1108
01:23:50,808 --> 01:23:51,628
[SPEAKER_23]: Did I have another topic?

1109
01:23:51,828 --> 01:23:53,350
[SPEAKER_23]: I knew I had something Ultramix 2 related.

1110
01:23:53,370 --> 01:23:56,372
[SPEAKER_23]: I want to get to the cage match soon, too, but I guess we can do one more quick topic.

1111
01:23:56,813 --> 01:24:02,798
[SPEAKER_23]: You know that some of the first early reviews of Ultramix 2 came out, and one of them has been making rounds on the Freak.

1112
01:24:03,258 --> 01:24:05,480
[SPEAKER_23]: It's the one that was in GMR Magazine.

1113
01:24:06,561 --> 01:24:09,224
[SPEAKER_23]: And apparently, they're not big fans of the game.

1114
01:24:10,902 --> 01:24:14,507
[SPEAKER_23]: But man, the freak, they are tearing this guy apart.

1115
01:24:14,567 --> 01:24:15,909
[SPEAKER_23]: Like, I was just reading this.

1116
01:24:16,230 --> 01:24:20,376
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm looking at the thread here, page 160, I think it's 161 or 162 of the thread.

1117
01:24:20,817 --> 01:24:24,202
[SPEAKER_23]: Somebody tried, like, harassing the guy on AOL and everything.

1118
01:24:25,813 --> 01:24:32,339
[SPEAKER_23]: I'd say harassing, but you know, maybe borderline stalking the guy on AOL trying to say, What's wrong with you?

1119
01:24:32,719 --> 01:24:34,080
[SPEAKER_21]: Fuck you, you fucking fuck!

1120
01:24:34,621 --> 01:24:35,281
[SPEAKER_23]: No, I'm kidding.

1121
01:24:35,341 --> 01:24:37,643
[SPEAKER_23]: It was more mature than that, but, you know, not by much.

1122
01:24:38,404 --> 01:24:42,287
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, you know, part of half of me is, you know, saying, Oh yeah, go, you know, stick up for us.

1123
01:24:42,307 --> 01:24:44,508
[SPEAKER_21]: The other half is, you ain't even played the game yourself.

1124
01:24:44,529 --> 01:24:45,850
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, what the hell do you know?

1125
01:24:46,570 --> 01:24:50,774
[SPEAKER_21]: So, I mean, I think ultimately, you know, only God could judge us, and if he did, he'd give us an A+.

1126
01:24:53,255 --> 01:24:54,376
[SPEAKER_21]: No, this is those fuckers!

1127
01:25:11,536 --> 01:25:13,678
[SPEAKER_26]: Hi, this is Eris from GameStop.

1128
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:16,161
[SPEAKER_15]: Eris?

1129
01:25:16,441 --> 01:25:17,322
[SPEAKER_26]: Are you dead?

1130
01:25:17,442 --> 01:25:18,943
[SPEAKER_26]: Hi, this is Eris at GameStop.

1131
01:25:19,744 --> 01:25:19,824
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

1132
01:25:26,044 --> 01:25:27,706
[SPEAKER_26]: You've reserved a blank game.

1133
01:25:27,846 --> 01:25:31,109
[SPEAKER_25]: And it's like, Eris is like a reference to Eris from Final Fantasy 7.

1134
01:25:31,189 --> 01:25:32,650
[SPEAKER_25]: It's-a me, Mario!

1135
01:25:33,130 --> 01:25:36,654
[SPEAKER_25]: I just wanted to let you know that your Sonic the Hedgehog game came in!

1136
01:25:37,034 --> 01:25:37,715
[SPEAKER_23]: Mamma mia!

1137
01:25:37,835 --> 01:25:45,522
[SPEAKER_26]: Even though, and people who have seen me play Final Fantasy 7 know this because I have my game saved at this one particular place.

1138
01:25:45,962 --> 01:25:50,265
[SPEAKER_26]: so that I can take this shit out of Jenova again and watch Aerith die all over again.

1139
01:25:50,305 --> 01:25:51,986
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, it's a great thing to relive, right?

1140
01:25:52,026 --> 01:25:54,388
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh my god, you guys, stop spoiling Final Fantasy 7.

1141
01:25:54,428 --> 01:25:55,789
[SPEAKER_23]: I haven't played it yet.

1142
01:25:55,929 --> 01:25:56,910
[SPEAKER_26]: She dies!

1143
01:25:59,111 --> 01:25:59,812
[SPEAKER_25]: Get over it.

1144
01:25:59,892 --> 01:26:00,512
[SPEAKER_26]: And I cheer.

1145
01:26:01,113 --> 01:26:02,193
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, it's good.

1146
01:26:02,794 --> 01:26:09,739
[SPEAKER_25]: The only thing, in my opinion, that can ruin Advent Children is if Aerith somehow comes back to life.

1147
01:26:09,799 --> 01:26:14,382
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh my god, that would just... Okay, so, that being said,

1148
01:26:15,060 --> 01:26:16,441
[SPEAKER_25]: You guys have no feelings.

1149
01:26:17,362 --> 01:26:17,682
[SPEAKER_25]: Why?

1150
01:26:18,103 --> 01:26:19,664
[SPEAKER_25]: Tifa is a much better woman.

1151
01:26:22,066 --> 01:26:22,747
[SPEAKER_23]: She can kick ass.

1152
01:26:22,767 --> 01:26:26,790
[SPEAKER_25]: I can't believe we're having this discussion, so I'm going to change the subject back to this review.

1153
01:26:26,810 --> 01:26:29,432
[SPEAKER_25]: If I got a call from Eris from GameStop, I would run away.

1154
01:26:30,153 --> 01:26:31,814
[SPEAKER_26]: Eris had codependency issues.

1155
01:26:31,874 --> 01:26:32,194
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

1156
01:26:35,052 --> 01:26:35,693
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh my lord.

1157
01:26:37,214 --> 01:26:41,016
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, if you want to join in the fun, they posted his AOL screen name and everything.

1158
01:26:41,056 --> 01:26:51,544
[SPEAKER_23]: I just think that's kind of interesting that they got the whole little... I mean, for lack of a better term, I know it's not these same guys, but I can't help but think of the word be mafia to describe what's going on here.

1159
01:26:53,045 --> 01:26:56,688
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't like using that term because I know it's not the same people, but you know what I mean.

1160
01:26:56,728 --> 01:27:02,512
[SPEAKER_23]: It's still the same idea where these guys are just hounding this poor guy that was just reviewing and...

1161
01:27:03,052 --> 01:27:03,793
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, you never know.

1162
01:27:03,813 --> 01:27:07,197
[SPEAKER_23]: Once a festival hits Japan, Japan critics are going to say, you know, it's not American enough.

1163
01:27:07,237 --> 01:27:07,337
[SPEAKER_23]: Wow.

1164
01:27:21,364 --> 01:27:27,929
[SPEAKER_23]: Good news is that some other reviews are coming out, and I think we've seen 7.5s and 8s, and average DDR scores are on the board.

1165
01:27:28,469 --> 01:27:37,536
[SPEAKER_23]: I think, again, a lot of these people don't really... The folks that review hundreds and hundreds of games for the magazines and stuff, they don't have time to submerse themselves in the communities of all these games.

1166
01:27:38,257 --> 01:27:41,219
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't think a lot of these folks maybe realize...

1167
01:27:42,851 --> 01:27:51,976
[SPEAKER_23]: Just how different and how anticipated this game is in America just because it isn't a Japanese release, you know what I mean?

1168
01:27:52,836 --> 01:27:53,136
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know.

1169
01:27:53,977 --> 01:27:54,857
[SPEAKER_23]: That's just my take on it.

1170
01:27:56,978 --> 01:28:03,802
[SPEAKER_23]: It's finally like one of those games that seems to have very, very, very few ties to Japan other than the fact that, hey, the game was originally created there.

1171
01:28:03,822 --> 01:28:06,523
[SPEAKER_23]: But it's like, you know, whole new interface, whole new game, whole new modes.

1172
01:28:06,604 --> 01:28:09,345
[SPEAKER_23]: It's really, truly like an American production.

1173
01:28:10,309 --> 01:28:16,915
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it's just kind of one of those things where it's just after time that series will have its own identity more than anything.

1174
01:28:16,995 --> 01:28:24,601
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's all you can really, I mean, just I as a gamer, think originality and just like making, you know, like being a little different.

1175
01:28:24,821 --> 01:28:38,373
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, sure, you know, DDR is pretty universal as far as like within Konami itself and all, but if you got Ultramix 2 and it's like always kind of like that cutting edge type thing, it's like, well, you know, some people watch like M2, you know, as opposed to MTV or, you know, watch all those other niche shows because, you

1176
01:28:38,868 --> 01:28:45,464
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, it's like, they already know they like the game, but they want to see it to its, you know, maximum potential or something different, and, you know, I mean, it's, why not?

1177
01:28:48,035 --> 01:28:48,656
[SPEAKER_23]: Very interesting.

1178
01:28:48,956 --> 01:28:51,038
[SPEAKER_23]: Apparently now, I'm getting a follow-up.

1179
01:28:51,098 --> 01:28:58,924
[SPEAKER_23]: Apparently our old Orange Lounge Radio favorite, Al Mullet, is the one that's been doing a little bit of this AOL, harassing this guy.

1180
01:28:59,164 --> 01:29:04,349
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, he's the pusher for the cookies, so he gets the amnesty right away.

1181
01:29:04,489 --> 01:29:04,989
[SPEAKER_23]: That's right.

1182
01:29:05,249 --> 01:29:07,451
[SPEAKER_23]: But no, apparently he has responded.

1183
01:29:07,772 --> 01:29:09,013
[SPEAKER_23]: We don't know the details yet, though.

1184
01:29:09,033 --> 01:29:14,597
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm hearing this all secondhand, but maybe we'll... Keep checking the Freak for developments, because maybe something will get posted there.

1185
01:29:14,938 --> 01:29:15,278
[SPEAKER_15]: Whoops.

1186
01:29:15,871 --> 01:29:26,696
[SPEAKER_23]: I want my boyfriend to watch me play the game and start crying because the game makes him feel inadequate while I enthusiastically play the hell out of it.

1187
01:29:38,390 --> 01:29:38,910
[SPEAKER_23]: Who said this?

1188
01:29:39,190 --> 01:29:39,911
[SPEAKER_23]: DD Arcaholic.

1189
01:29:40,311 --> 01:29:42,752
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, I thought this was Rice Princess.

1190
01:29:42,832 --> 01:29:43,332
[SPEAKER_23]: No, no.

1191
01:29:44,232 --> 01:29:45,052
[SPEAKER_23]: That would have been funny, though.

1192
01:29:46,133 --> 01:29:46,753
[SPEAKER_23]: That's great.

1193
01:29:48,014 --> 01:29:49,034
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm sure she would have said it, too.

1194
01:29:49,054 --> 01:29:50,915
[SPEAKER_25]: You know what, though?

1195
01:29:52,335 --> 01:29:53,696
[SPEAKER_25]: That's happened.

1196
01:29:55,576 --> 01:29:57,877
[SPEAKER_25]: That's all personal preference, what game makes you want to play it so much.

1197
01:29:58,117 --> 01:30:04,580
[SPEAKER_25]: There's been times where Rice Princess was so hooked on the game where she would just play it all the time and we didn't really have time for much else.

1198
01:30:05,080 --> 01:30:05,880
[SPEAKER_25]: That's just how it is.

1199
01:30:06,260 --> 01:30:06,821
[SPEAKER_25]: You're a gamer.

1200
01:30:07,041 --> 01:30:07,801
[SPEAKER_25]: You're in a relationship.

1201
01:30:08,578 --> 01:30:08,758
[SPEAKER_25]: Charge!

1202
01:30:08,778 --> 01:30:08,898
[SPEAKER_25]: Charge!

1203
01:30:33,012 --> 01:30:39,035
[SPEAKER_23]: Last week in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, Jamie won it with a song, I guess it's some sort of parody song.

1204
01:30:39,435 --> 01:30:40,436
[SPEAKER_23]: It was a little silly.

1205
01:30:40,496 --> 01:30:43,558
[SPEAKER_26]: Five, four, three, one, off blast.

1206
01:30:43,718 --> 01:30:50,501
[SPEAKER_23]: But it was very popular nonetheless, and it won our cage match with a sweeping victory.

1207
01:30:51,202 --> 01:30:57,285
[SPEAKER_23]: It was Zlod with Electronic Supersonic, and that's the first song we're going to hear a clip of in tonight's cage match.

1208
01:30:58,365 --> 01:30:59,206
[SPEAKER_23]: Now here's the thing.

1209
01:31:00,908 --> 01:31:04,132
[SPEAKER_23]: Much to Loki's hatred, he does not like this song.

1210
01:31:04,913 --> 01:31:08,477
[SPEAKER_23]: He's only pissed off because he's the one that usually puts the smart-ass songs in.

1211
01:31:09,478 --> 01:31:12,481
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm debating whether to put a really shitty song or a really good song tonight.

1212
01:31:12,501 --> 01:31:12,682
[SPEAKER_23]: Hold on.

1213
01:31:12,702 --> 01:31:13,422
[SPEAKER_24]: I have to agree.

1214
01:31:16,766 --> 01:31:17,948
[SPEAKER_25]: Papa Smurf was awesome.

1215
01:31:19,096 --> 01:31:19,976
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, hold on.

1216
01:31:20,776 --> 01:31:34,599
[SPEAKER_25]: Way back in the day, back when you weren't in the hundreds yet in episodes, like probably not even in the 20s or something, I once, we didn't have three people for a cage match, so I once, I said, go ahead and put in one of my songs, and you're like, what is this?

1217
01:31:34,639 --> 01:31:36,319
[SPEAKER_25]: God, I'm not ready for this.

1218
01:31:36,899 --> 01:31:40,940
[SPEAKER_25]: And I put in an Aquabats song, which is a pretty popular Ska group.

1219
01:31:41,300 --> 01:31:45,661
[SPEAKER_25]: And you said, I don't see that as a cage match song.

1220
01:31:46,181 --> 01:31:51,386
[SPEAKER_25]: How is Dark Sakura's song, though it is very funny, any different than that?

1221
01:31:51,486 --> 01:31:54,810
[SPEAKER_25]: It is not what you would see as a cage match song, but you didn't say anything.

1222
01:31:54,870 --> 01:31:55,550
[SPEAKER_25]: Here's the thing, though.

1223
01:31:55,570 --> 01:31:58,653
[SPEAKER_23]: The thing is, though, you're full of shit.

1224
01:31:59,194 --> 01:32:00,976
[SPEAKER_23]: Shut up before I shove my cock in your mouth.

1225
01:32:00,996 --> 01:32:01,276
[SPEAKER_23]: Shut up.

1226
01:32:02,117 --> 01:32:03,398
[SPEAKER_26]: Where's my camera?

1227
01:32:05,100 --> 01:32:10,164
[SPEAKER_23]: The cage match has evolved an awful lot the past, you know, 100 episodes we've been doing it.

1228
01:32:10,865 --> 01:32:14,548
[SPEAKER_23]: I think it used to be the thing where it was like DDR, Guitar Freaks, 2DX songs.

1229
01:32:14,989 --> 01:32:17,010
[SPEAKER_23]: Now it's kinda like cool stuff.

1230
01:32:17,090 --> 01:32:18,432
[SPEAKER_23]: No, no, no, wait, wait, wait, okay, wait.

1231
01:32:18,972 --> 01:32:23,196
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm totally calling bullshit because... There are still songs that I have said are not Cage Madge.

1232
01:32:23,336 --> 01:32:23,776
[SPEAKER_25]: Just wait.

1233
01:32:24,257 --> 01:32:32,884
[SPEAKER_25]: For about four weeks ago or five weeks ago, Matt put on a song by, um... No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1234
01:32:32,944 --> 01:32:37,508
[SPEAKER_25]: The song you put on by, um, Compufonic, uh, what's the name of the band?

1235
01:32:38,491 --> 01:32:39,451
[SPEAKER_25]: Echo Image.

1236
01:32:40,252 --> 01:32:41,012
[SPEAKER_25]: What's the name of that song?

1237
01:32:41,792 --> 01:32:42,312
[SPEAKER_25]: Come Back.

1238
01:32:42,853 --> 01:32:47,234
[SPEAKER_25]: That song is awesome, and you said, I don't see it as a cage match song.

1239
01:32:47,334 --> 01:32:48,054
[SPEAKER_23]: I didn't, and I still don't.

1240
01:32:48,074 --> 01:32:50,795
[SPEAKER_25]: It totally fits perfectly into the genre of music we play.

1241
01:32:51,175 --> 01:32:53,716
[SPEAKER_25]: It was techno pop, or electro pop, or whatever.

1242
01:32:53,856 --> 01:32:56,437
[SPEAKER_23]: I didn't, and I still don't.

1243
01:32:56,657 --> 01:32:57,617
[SPEAKER_23]: Stick my foot up your ass.

1244
01:32:57,677 --> 01:33:05,260
[SPEAKER_23]: What do I know, because it's the first song ever to have to be retired from the cage match, so obviously it doesn't come down to my opinion, it comes down to the opinion of the listeners.

1245
01:33:06,178 --> 01:33:08,040
[SPEAKER_23]: So put that in your pipe and smoke it.

1246
01:33:09,261 --> 01:33:14,506
[SPEAKER_25]: Whatever happened to the days when we used to say that we do this radio show for our amusement, not their amusement?

1247
01:33:15,767 --> 01:33:17,829
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, we sold out like cheap whores.

1248
01:33:17,869 --> 01:33:18,530
[SPEAKER_23]: What do you expect?

1249
01:33:18,550 --> 01:33:19,210
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Sal.

1250
01:33:19,310 --> 01:33:19,831
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Sal.

1251
01:33:20,151 --> 01:33:20,732
[SPEAKER_23]: Can I have a hug?

1252
01:33:21,993 --> 01:33:22,734
[SPEAKER_23]: Get away from me.

1253
01:33:22,754 --> 01:33:23,294
[SPEAKER_23]: Can I have a hug?

1254
01:33:25,096 --> 01:33:25,556
[SPEAKER_23]: I want a hug.

1255
01:33:26,637 --> 01:33:26,858
[SPEAKER_23]: There.

1256
01:33:27,418 --> 01:33:29,140
[SPEAKER_23]: We're going to put our differences aside.

1257
01:33:29,160 --> 01:33:29,280
[SPEAKER_18]: Aww.

1258
01:33:30,143 --> 01:33:31,484
[SPEAKER_18]: Don't try to grope me, get out of here.

1259
01:33:31,564 --> 01:33:31,884
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

1260
01:33:33,606 --> 01:33:37,308
[SPEAKER_04]: You're hugging, very provocative.

1261
01:33:37,829 --> 01:33:38,649
[SPEAKER_23]: That was very erotic.

1262
01:33:38,969 --> 01:33:39,430
[SPEAKER_23]: You gotta do that.

1263
01:33:39,550 --> 01:33:40,611
[SPEAKER_23]: No, I'm kidding.

1264
01:33:40,971 --> 01:33:41,671
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright, I'm kidding.

1265
01:33:41,731 --> 01:33:43,253
[SPEAKER_23]: Why don't we make a video game out of that?

1266
01:33:43,493 --> 01:33:44,954
[SPEAKER_21]: There we go.

1267
01:33:45,654 --> 01:33:46,875
[SPEAKER_23]: Hug hug revolution.

1268
01:33:46,895 --> 01:33:49,477
[SPEAKER_26]: There was that one game that was at the Natsume booth at E3.

1269
01:33:49,517 --> 01:33:51,258
[SPEAKER_26]: Where you go around kissing people.

1270
01:33:51,619 --> 01:33:52,279
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, Tulip.

1271
01:33:52,539 --> 01:33:53,480
[SPEAKER_23]: Tulip.

1272
01:33:53,640 --> 01:33:54,340
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright, anyway.

1273
01:33:54,721 --> 01:33:56,042
[SPEAKER_23]: Hello, cage match, hello.

1274
01:33:57,307 --> 01:33:58,628
[SPEAKER_23]: All right, we're going to get into this.

1275
01:33:58,748 --> 01:34:00,590
[SPEAKER_23]: It's Electronic Supersonic.

1276
01:34:00,810 --> 01:34:04,974
[SPEAKER_23]: You get to hear a clip of it because it won last week, and then you'll hear two new songs in their entirety.

1277
01:34:05,434 --> 01:34:08,036
[SPEAKER_23]: And I can't wait to hear what, like you saw, has to say about my pick tonight.

1278
01:34:08,076 --> 01:34:08,637
[SPEAKER_23]: He's going to love it.

1279
01:34:09,417 --> 01:34:13,601
[SPEAKER_23]: Anyway... I thought we did piss Brad off on our show on here.

1280
01:34:13,621 --> 01:34:14,181
[SPEAKER_23]: Sorry, sorry.

1281
01:34:14,562 --> 01:34:15,102
[SPEAKER_23]: Here we go.

1282
01:34:15,182 --> 01:34:16,463
[SPEAKER_23]: You can vote for this if you want.

1283
01:34:16,523 --> 01:34:18,225
[SPEAKER_23]: It's a clip of song number one.

1284
01:34:18,265 --> 01:34:21,447
[SPEAKER_23]: This is Zlod with Electronic Supersonic.

1285
01:34:21,507 --> 01:34:21,808
[SPEAKER_23]: Enjoy.

1286
01:34:24,341 --> 01:34:26,783
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey baby, wake up from your asleep.

1287
01:34:27,163 --> 01:34:38,852
[SPEAKER_00]: We have arrived onto the future and the whole world is become... Electronic Supersonic Supersonic

1288
01:34:39,930 --> 01:35:05,878
[SPEAKER_00]: Electronic Hey baby, ride with me away, we doesn't have much time My blue jeans is tight, so on to my love rocket climb Inside tank of fuel is not fuel, but love Above us, there is nothing above, but the stars above All systems gone, prepare for a down count 5, 4, 3, 1

1289
01:35:08,348 --> 01:35:29,270
[SPEAKER_00]: Fly away in my space rocket You no need put money in my pocket The door is closed, I just lock it I put my go-plug in your socket The sun and sky is bright like fire You and me gets higher and higher

1290
01:35:34,938 --> 01:35:38,199
[SPEAKER_00]: Only thing can stop us is flat tire.

1291
01:35:41,639 --> 01:35:45,300
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, love crusader, I want to be your space invader.

1292
01:35:45,580 --> 01:35:48,501
[SPEAKER_00]: For you, I would descend the deepest moon crater.

1293
01:35:48,881 --> 01:35:51,322
[SPEAKER_00]: I is more stronger than dark vapor.

1294
01:35:51,542 --> 01:35:54,202
[SPEAKER_00]: Obey me, I is your new dictator.

1295
01:35:54,462 --> 01:35:56,383
[SPEAKER_00]: For you is Venus, I am Mars.

1296
01:35:56,683 --> 01:35:59,423
[SPEAKER_00]: With you, I is more richer than all the stars.

1297
01:35:59,723 --> 01:36:01,504
[SPEAKER_00]: Make a wishes on a shooting stars.

1298
01:36:01,744 --> 01:36:02,904
[SPEAKER_00]: Then for you, I will play on

1299
01:36:05,956 --> 01:36:10,118
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, that was song number one in tonight's cage match.

1300
01:36:10,158 --> 01:36:12,739
[SPEAKER_11]: Last week's winner is Zlod, Electronic Supersonic.

1301
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:25,921
[SPEAKER_23]: Wake up from your sleep.

1302
01:36:25,961 --> 01:36:28,683
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, wake up from your sleep if you fell asleep during that.

1303
01:36:29,163 --> 01:36:33,966
[SPEAKER_23]: If you haven't seen the video yet, somebody posted it on The Freak a while back.

1304
01:36:34,006 --> 01:36:35,367
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know if it got posted in our forums.

1305
01:36:35,407 --> 01:36:40,830
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't think it did, but go check the random chat on The Freak and see if you can find it because it's pretty funny.

1306
01:36:41,111 --> 01:36:41,571
[SPEAKER_23]: It's pretty funny.

1307
01:36:41,911 --> 01:36:44,893
[SPEAKER_23]: All right, next up in the cage match, Loki's pick for this week.

1308
01:36:44,973 --> 01:36:45,994
[SPEAKER_23]: Loki, what did you pick for us?

1309
01:36:47,097 --> 01:36:57,827
[SPEAKER_24]: I picked Rammstein's song off their new album, it's called America, and it's a nice American hating song, and I hate America, so here we go.

1310
01:36:57,847 --> 01:37:03,713
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright, here's song number two, Rammstein, and I just gotta say, now wait a minute.

1311
01:37:04,790 --> 01:37:10,895
[SPEAKER_23]: See, Jamie puts in the song that I would expect Loki to put in, and now Loki is putting in the song I would expect Jamie to put in.

1312
01:37:10,915 --> 01:37:11,716
[SPEAKER_23]: What is going on?

1313
01:37:11,736 --> 01:37:13,718
[SPEAKER_23]: What in the hell is going on with this show?

1314
01:37:13,938 --> 01:37:15,740
[SPEAKER_26]: I've played this song plenty of times on my show.

1315
01:37:15,820 --> 01:37:18,202
[SPEAKER_23]: And I'm going to put in the song that nobody would put in.

1316
01:37:18,302 --> 01:37:20,384
[SPEAKER_23]: So, here we go.

1317
01:37:20,484 --> 01:37:23,266
[SPEAKER_23]: Song number two, Rammstein with America.

1318
01:37:23,366 --> 01:37:23,667
[SPEAKER_23]: Enjoy.

1319
01:37:26,556 --> 01:37:29,779
We're all living in America, America

1320
01:37:54,157 --> 01:37:55,725
Thanks for watching!

1321
01:37:59,304 --> 01:38:04,525
[SPEAKER_09]: Even if you turn around alone, let yourself be controlled a little.

1322
01:38:04,805 --> 01:38:07,326
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll show you what's right.

1323
01:38:07,366 --> 01:38:08,206
[SPEAKER_09]: We want to give a life.

1324
01:38:08,246 --> 01:38:11,167
[SPEAKER_09]: Freedom plays on all violins.

1325
01:38:11,187 --> 01:38:13,187
[SPEAKER_09]: Music comes from the White House.

1326
01:38:13,327 --> 01:38:15,588
[SPEAKER_09]: And in front of Paris is Mickey Mouse.

1327
01:38:44,991 --> 01:38:46,893
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1328
01:39:23,903 --> 01:39:30,988
We're all living in America America, America We're all living in America Coca-Cola, Wanda Bra We're all living in America

1329
01:39:58,503 --> 01:40:03,744
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think my mother's gone No, this is not a love song We're all living in a mess

1330
01:40:46,642 --> 01:40:47,624
Thank you for watching!

1331
01:41:14,106 --> 01:41:16,708
[SPEAKER_23]: All right, that was song number two in tonight's cage match.

1332
01:41:16,768 --> 01:41:19,931
[SPEAKER_23]: That was Rammstein with America.

1333
01:41:20,691 --> 01:41:21,372
[SPEAKER_23]: Very interesting.

1334
01:41:21,472 --> 01:41:28,958
[SPEAKER_23]: And because I forgot to say it earlier, and I forgot we're going to have a lot of new listeners now with the whole DDR Freak Radio syndication, I should explain what the cage match is all about.

1335
01:41:28,978 --> 01:41:30,819
[SPEAKER_23]: That's where we play three songs.

1336
01:41:30,959 --> 01:41:32,100
[SPEAKER_23]: Each host picks a song.

1337
01:41:32,200 --> 01:41:38,806
[SPEAKER_23]: They go head-to-head against each other, and the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio Live.

1338
01:41:39,806 --> 01:41:45,330
[SPEAKER_23]: Orange Lounge Radio is the Monty Music and More program, which airs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week on Orange Lounge Radio.

1339
01:41:46,251 --> 01:41:57,198
[SPEAKER_23]: Again, the cage match kind of started as songs that would be really good in DDR, 2DX, and Demonte-type games, but I think it just kind of turned into a clusterfuck of whatever's cool, as I was telling Pratt earlier.

1340
01:41:58,179 --> 01:42:03,223
[SPEAKER_23]: Anyway, we're going to give our thoughts on those songs, but of course it is up to you in the end what you think.

1341
01:42:03,663 --> 01:42:06,245
[SPEAKER_23]: You are the ones that have the final say, but we're going to give you a hint.

1342
01:42:06,785 --> 01:42:07,946
[SPEAKER_23]: Jamie, you want to go first?

1343
01:42:09,068 --> 01:42:09,749
[SPEAKER_26]: I hate that shit.

1344
01:42:09,769 --> 01:42:09,929
[SPEAKER_26]: Do it.

1345
01:42:09,949 --> 01:42:11,571
[SPEAKER_26]: Turn that shit off.

1346
01:42:29,665 --> 01:42:31,827
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm turning the shift off.

1347
01:42:31,928 --> 01:42:36,172
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't want my sticky keys to come on without, you know, actually anything being on there.

1348
01:42:36,393 --> 01:42:39,256
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't want to hear about your sticky keys.

1349
01:42:40,257 --> 01:42:41,778
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't get the keys sticky usually.

1350
01:42:42,719 --> 01:42:42,980
[SPEAKER_25]: Anyway.

1351
01:42:44,423 --> 01:42:45,044
[SPEAKER_25]: Something else.

1352
01:42:45,364 --> 01:42:45,944
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, go ahead.

1353
01:42:46,325 --> 01:42:46,865
[SPEAKER_25]: Mikey Style.

1354
01:42:47,386 --> 01:42:48,347
[SPEAKER_25]: What, should I rate it?

1355
01:42:48,507 --> 01:42:48,707
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

1356
01:42:49,848 --> 01:42:55,754
[SPEAKER_25]: Definitely not one of the better Rammstein songs in my opinion, so I'm going to give it a 5.

1357
01:42:56,334 --> 01:42:56,675
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright.

1358
01:42:57,475 --> 01:42:59,237
[SPEAKER_25]: No, there's better songs than Dew Haas that they did.

1359
01:42:59,837 --> 01:43:00,098
[SPEAKER_25]: Loki.

1360
01:43:01,898 --> 01:43:25,699
[SPEAKER_24]: I liked it, it's, I have, you know, honestly, this album is not as good as the last album, the last album, every song fucking rocked, unfortunately, I don't have their last album ripped to my computer, so, I had to pick from this album, and, I like it, um, it's like this album had, like, a lot of, like, country named songs, so, I was torn between this one or Rush, uh, Moscow, so, uh, Moscow would have been pretty good.

1361
01:43:26,385 --> 01:43:29,907
[SPEAKER_25]: And you don't hate Moscow nearly as much as you hate America, so you had to pick America.

1362
01:43:29,927 --> 01:43:37,351
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, Moscow had a girl that sings in it, it's like Tattoo, and it's got also the... Sounds like Tattoo.

1363
01:43:37,391 --> 01:43:42,093
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, and it also has accordion in the background that kind of goes with it.

1364
01:43:42,133 --> 01:43:43,514
[SPEAKER_24]: It's weird, but it sounds good.

1365
01:43:44,915 --> 01:43:45,375
[SPEAKER_21]: Clowock.

1366
01:43:46,483 --> 01:44:01,191
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, I don't know, every time I hear, you know, all that kind of, you know, music, I think of, like, the German greats, you know, I think of Vanilla Ninja, I think of, uh, Falco, David Hasselhoff, you know, I mean, so, I have to, I have to accept my hierarchy.

1367
01:44:01,231 --> 01:44:03,372
[SPEAKER_21]: Is Falco the guy that's, like, putting on the ritz?

1368
01:44:03,732 --> 01:44:04,513
[SPEAKER_21]: No, that was Taco.

1369
01:44:04,653 --> 01:44:05,233
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, Taco.

1370
01:44:05,253 --> 01:44:05,934
[SPEAKER_15]: Taco, Taco.

1371
01:44:13,699 --> 01:44:22,048
[SPEAKER_21]: I have to set my hierarchy, and although that one was pretty interesting, I still think David Hasselhoff beats their ass.

1372
01:44:22,328 --> 01:44:22,769
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll give it a 7.

1373
01:44:24,491 --> 01:44:24,831
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll give it a 7.

1374
01:44:27,774 --> 01:44:33,235
[SPEAKER_23]: I surprisingly like that song, which is rare for one of Loki's picks.

1375
01:44:33,335 --> 01:44:36,396
[SPEAKER_23]: No, actually I did like that song, and I would probably give it an 8.

1376
01:44:36,736 --> 01:44:39,677
[SPEAKER_23]: And going back to the cage match thing, I could see it in Guitar Freaks.

1377
01:44:39,697 --> 01:44:40,757
[SPEAKER_23]: I think that would be a fun one to play.

1378
01:44:42,918 --> 01:44:43,298
[SPEAKER_23]: Explicit.

1379
01:44:44,078 --> 01:44:51,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's a pretty interesting song, but I've heard better songs from Rammstein, so I'm going to give it a 7 out of 10.

1380
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:52,740
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright, there you have it.

1381
01:44:53,020 --> 01:44:55,721
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright, but it doesn't matter what we think, it's all up to what you guys think.

1382
01:44:56,834 --> 01:45:00,117
[SPEAKER_24]: What's your favorite ODB quote?

1383
01:45:16,500 --> 01:45:19,324
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm going to refrain from comments.

1384
01:45:19,364 --> 01:45:19,944
[SPEAKER_26]: Be polite.

1385
01:45:20,285 --> 01:45:21,025
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, anyway.

1386
01:45:22,527 --> 01:45:23,048
[SPEAKER_21]: Moving on.

1387
01:45:23,068 --> 01:45:24,269
[SPEAKER_21]: He literally dropped dead.

1388
01:45:27,381 --> 01:45:28,802
[SPEAKER_21]: At the age of 35 or 36.

1389
01:45:29,102 --> 01:45:31,464
[SPEAKER_21]: He literally just dropped dead in the studio.

1390
01:45:31,484 --> 01:45:36,768
[SPEAKER_21]: No, just like probably in a music studio, probably recording, which proves to us once again, cocaine is a hell of a drug.

1391
01:45:36,908 --> 01:45:38,829
[SPEAKER_21]: You know he died with a 40 in his hand.

1392
01:45:40,170 --> 01:45:43,732
[SPEAKER_21]: And still owing like six child support payments to his baby mama.

1393
01:45:44,513 --> 01:45:49,076
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, he probably was dead like about 30 minutes before he actually fell to the floor.

1394
01:45:49,096 --> 01:45:51,558
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, it's just the cracking and it was keeping him going.

1395
01:45:52,294 --> 01:45:53,874
[SPEAKER_23]: Can I get to my song, please?

1396
01:45:55,195 --> 01:45:56,035
[SPEAKER_23]: Comment, DarkSakura?

1397
01:45:56,555 --> 01:46:08,978
[SPEAKER_26]: I just can't... don't feel very mournful over someone who didn't take responsibility for his children, so... I'm not the biggest fan either, but... We don't have a 40-ounce to tip in his honor, so we had to do something personal otherwise.

1398
01:46:09,018 --> 01:46:09,638
[SPEAKER_21]: Urinate instead.

1399
01:46:10,518 --> 01:46:10,938
[SPEAKER_23]: Anyway.

1400
01:46:12,178 --> 01:46:13,999
[SPEAKER_23]: Moving on, my pick...

1401
01:46:14,679 --> 01:46:15,300
[SPEAKER_23]: Whatcha Waitin' For?

1402
01:46:37,597 --> 01:46:38,618
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright, and here it is.

1403
01:46:38,858 --> 01:46:39,298
[SPEAKER_23]: Enjoy.

1404
01:46:39,618 --> 01:46:41,099
[SPEAKER_23]: I think this song will be perfect for DDR.

1405
01:46:41,139 --> 01:46:41,720
[SPEAKER_23]: You be the judge.

1406
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:42,040
[SPEAKER_23]: Here it is.

1407
01:46:42,060 --> 01:46:44,162
[SPEAKER_23]: Song number three, Gwen Stefani, What You Waitin' For.

1408
01:46:44,222 --> 01:46:44,602
[SPEAKER_23]: Enjoy.

1409
01:46:50,846 --> 01:47:03,175
[SPEAKER_08]: What an amazing time, what a family How did the years go by, now it's only me

1410
01:47:42,596 --> 01:47:43,700
Thanks for watching!

1411
01:48:01,399 --> 01:48:03,102
Thank you for watching!

1412
01:48:29,145 --> 01:48:30,246
Thank you for watching!

1413
01:49:00,927 --> 01:49:02,470
Thank you for watching!

1414
01:49:26,445 --> 01:49:37,510
[SPEAKER_15]: Watch now, you're still a supermodel female You've got your million dollar contract And they're all waiting for your luncheon What you waiting, what you waiting

1415
01:49:56,674 --> 01:49:58,716
I'm waiting for you.

1416
01:49:58,977 --> 01:50:00,898
I'm waiting for you.

1417
01:50:01,139 --> 01:50:01,939
I'm waiting for you.

1418
01:50:29,447 --> 01:50:31,908
[SPEAKER_23]: All right, that was song number three in tonight's cage match.

1419
01:50:31,968 --> 01:50:34,068
[SPEAKER_23]: Gwen Stefani, what you waiting for?

1420
01:50:34,688 --> 01:50:36,749
[SPEAKER_23]: And I can tell you right now, we waiting for Jamie.

1421
01:50:37,029 --> 01:50:37,649
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, here she comes.

1422
01:50:38,289 --> 01:50:40,049
[SPEAKER_23]: Jamie, I know you were gone for part of that.

1423
01:50:40,069 --> 01:50:40,510
[SPEAKER_23]: What'd you think?

1424
01:50:41,350 --> 01:50:42,490
[SPEAKER_26]: It's too happy.

1425
01:50:45,711 --> 01:50:47,331
[SPEAKER_23]: It's a happy, too happy seven.

1426
01:50:47,651 --> 01:50:49,231
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, it's a happy, shiny seven.

1427
01:50:50,132 --> 01:50:51,932
[SPEAKER_25]: Happy, shiny seven.

1428
01:50:51,992 --> 01:50:52,812
[SPEAKER_25]: All right, lanky seven.

1429
01:50:53,852 --> 01:50:54,993
[SPEAKER_25]: Or is it shiny, happy seven?

1430
01:50:55,013 --> 01:50:55,493
[SPEAKER_25]: There we go.

1431
01:50:55,513 --> 01:50:56,213
[SPEAKER_25]: Anyway, um...

1432
01:50:58,117 --> 01:50:59,339
[SPEAKER_25]: I like that song a lot.

1433
01:51:00,260 --> 01:51:04,264
[SPEAKER_25]: I actually didn't hear that she was going solo until really recently, and then all of a sudden here's her song.

1434
01:51:04,544 --> 01:51:08,869
[SPEAKER_25]: And I was kind of like, eh, not a big surprise the sound style she took.

1435
01:51:09,049 --> 01:51:11,731
[SPEAKER_25]: It's kind of cliche, but it's still cool.

1436
01:51:11,772 --> 01:51:12,112
[SPEAKER_25]: I like it.

1437
01:51:12,252 --> 01:51:12,753
[SPEAKER_25]: It's dancey.

1438
01:51:13,453 --> 01:51:13,794
[SPEAKER_25]: Good stuff.

1439
01:51:14,394 --> 01:51:15,115
[SPEAKER_23]: On a scale of one to ten?

1440
01:51:15,615 --> 01:51:16,076
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, sorry.

1441
01:51:16,617 --> 01:51:18,679
[SPEAKER_25]: I'd say probably an 8.5.

1442
01:51:18,719 --> 01:51:18,859
[SPEAKER_25]: Loki!

1443
01:51:23,378 --> 01:51:27,422
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, well, there's two things that that song was lacking.

1444
01:51:27,682 --> 01:51:31,565
[SPEAKER_24]: Number one, well actually one thing that I didn't like about it, it was top 40.

1445
01:51:32,205 --> 01:51:33,947
[SPEAKER_24]: Number two, it did not have any English in it.

1446
01:51:34,427 --> 01:51:36,108
[SPEAKER_24]: There was no English in that song.

1447
01:51:36,128 --> 01:51:40,412
[SPEAKER_24]: The other two songs featured English, that song had none, therefore it gets a six.

1448
01:51:44,241 --> 01:51:45,402
[SPEAKER_21]: I like it.

1449
01:51:45,682 --> 01:51:49,705
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it's kind of doubled on the fact that the video for it was actually very cool.

1450
01:51:50,266 --> 01:51:56,891
[SPEAKER_21]: And ever since watching that video, I too would like to find a way to express how a giraffe does sound.

1451
01:51:57,712 --> 01:52:03,556
[SPEAKER_21]: Because for those who haven't seen the video, she's trying to get inspiration, so she goes to some clinic or whatever.

1452
01:52:03,836 --> 01:52:06,058
[SPEAKER_21]: They give her a survey, and one of the questions she has to answer is,

1453
01:52:06,448 --> 01:52:09,930
[SPEAKER_21]: In your best way possible, write out what the sound of giraffe makes.

1454
01:52:10,990 --> 01:52:14,512
[SPEAKER_21]: But I think it's a really bounce, definitely a pretty cool song.

1455
01:52:14,572 --> 01:52:18,914
[SPEAKER_21]: It's very reminiscent of like I would say probably mid-80s production of Debbie Harry.

1456
01:52:19,455 --> 01:52:24,857
[SPEAKER_21]: So I can totally get with that and this is one of those times where I do have to give out double digits, a 10 for me.

1457
01:52:25,158 --> 01:52:25,858
[SPEAKER_23]: Wow.

1458
01:52:26,718 --> 01:52:30,240
[SPEAKER_23]: I gotta say, you know what, that song just makes me want to shake my booty and spank yours.

1459
01:52:34,482 --> 01:52:35,142
[SPEAKER_23]: Give it a five.

1460
01:52:35,803 --> 01:52:36,804
[SPEAKER_23]: I give it a nine and a half.

1461
01:52:38,024 --> 01:52:38,505
[SPEAKER_23]: Exquisite.

1462
01:52:41,487 --> 01:52:43,588
[SPEAKER_04]: I really like the song.

1463
01:52:43,869 --> 01:52:49,913
[SPEAKER_04]: I like how Gwen Stefani went to the direction that has more of like an 80s type of background.

1464
01:52:51,274 --> 01:52:56,798
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the same time, I don't know, maybe I'm just not used to her music for that type of direction.

1465
01:52:58,206 --> 01:53:01,489
[SPEAKER_04]: So I probably gave it a... That's a pretty good song, so I gave it an 8.5.

1466
01:53:01,529 --> 01:53:06,933
[SPEAKER_04]: Might as well because of what Sky said about speaking his ass.

1467
01:53:06,953 --> 01:53:08,434
[SPEAKER_23]: So 7.5 for real.

1468
01:53:09,415 --> 01:53:11,337
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright, well good thing it's not up to these guys.

1469
01:53:11,397 --> 01:53:12,818
[SPEAKER_23]: It's up to you guys in the chatroom.

1470
01:53:13,218 --> 01:53:14,779
[SPEAKER_23]: Here's a recap and then you can vote.

1471
01:53:14,799 --> 01:53:16,861
[SPEAKER_23]: Here is song number one you can vote for tonight.

01:53:16,881 --> 01:53:18,422
[SPEAKER_23]: Zlod, Electronic Supersonic.

[SPEAKER_00]: Rocket You know need to put money in my pocket The door is closed, I just lock it

1474
01:53:31,055 --> 01:53:34,238
[SPEAKER_23]: Song number two you can vote for tonight is Rammstein with America.

1475

[SPEAKER_07]: And song number three you can vote for tonight is Gwen Stefani, Whatcha Waitin' For.

01:54:04,554 --> 01:54:07,898

[SPEAKER_23]: Song number one, song number two, or song number three.

1479
01:54:12,662 --> 01:54:15,766
[SPEAKER_23]: Loki, tell us what's going on in the sim scene this week.

1480
01:54:17,848 --> 01:54:18,328
[SPEAKER_24]: Nada.

1481
01:54:18,929 --> 01:54:19,029
[SPEAKER_24]: Um...

1482
01:54:19,616 --> 01:54:45,071
[SPEAKER_24]: I think I mentioned it last week, it was a release candidate to Step Mania came out and other than that there's really the only thing that's worth mentioning is there's a contest, a theme contest that's going on with all the themes that have been made this year they're trying to get DDR Maniacs' theme of 2004 with many in the running like Techno Fiend which is in the lead and

1483
01:54:46,229 --> 01:54:47,470
[SPEAKER_24]: Some other ones that are on there.

1484
01:54:48,670 --> 01:54:49,971
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, Technofiend.

1485
01:54:51,032 --> 01:54:55,374
[SPEAKER_24]: Anyways, Technolize, Technofiend, I can't remember what it's called.

1486
01:54:55,794 --> 01:54:57,315
[SPEAKER_24]: So yeah, those are worth checking out.

1487
01:54:57,475 --> 01:54:57,756
[SPEAKER_24]: I know...

1488
01:54:58,973 --> 01:55:03,777
[SPEAKER_24]: Technolize is working on version 3.0, which is supposed to be completely redone.

1489
01:55:04,557 --> 01:55:05,578
[SPEAKER_24]: It's still nice looking.

1490
01:55:07,740 --> 01:55:11,323
[SPEAKER_24]: Other than that, really not too much going on right now.

1491
01:55:11,823 --> 01:55:15,946
[SPEAKER_24]: I've been checking out this week, actually, BMS sim files.

1492
01:55:16,827 --> 01:55:22,251
[SPEAKER_24]: For those who don't know what those are, those are the homemade, key-sounded Beatmania 2DX.

1493
01:55:23,482 --> 01:55:24,263
[SPEAKER_24]: I will rock you

1494
01:55:48,445 --> 01:55:49,967
[SPEAKER_24]: It was really cool, actually.

1495
01:55:50,387 --> 01:55:50,888
[SPEAKER_24]: Very cool.

1496
01:55:50,908 --> 01:55:53,350
[SPEAKER_24]: They turned it into a house song, which was pretty neat.

1497
01:55:54,011 --> 01:56:02,160
[SPEAKER_24]: And then I have a remix of The Fall that's on there, and there's also Paranoia Delta, but that one's too much noise.

1498
01:56:03,361 --> 01:56:05,123
[SPEAKER_24]: It's like too grungy, so...

1499
01:56:05,803 --> 01:56:07,064
[SPEAKER_24]: Not worth playing on the show.

1500
01:56:07,565 --> 01:56:08,626
[SPEAKER_24]: But you can find those.

1501
01:56:08,706 --> 01:56:10,127
[SPEAKER_24]: There's sim files out there for them.

1502
01:56:10,707 --> 01:56:23,118
[SPEAKER_24]: Also one that was pointed out that I found would be Cigaru 180, which was by this... The only Russian Bimani remixer that I've seen.

1503
01:56:24,279 --> 01:56:25,319
[SPEAKER_24]: It's actually pretty cool.

1504
01:56:25,600 --> 01:56:26,801
[SPEAKER_24]: We might be able to play that later.

1505
01:56:28,082 --> 01:56:30,003
[SPEAKER_24]: But those are pretty much... That's all that's really going on.

1506
01:56:31,425 --> 01:56:31,965
[SPEAKER_24]: How long is it?

1507
01:56:32,005 --> 01:56:33,006
[SPEAKER_23]: It's only like a minute fifty, right?

1508
01:56:34,411 --> 01:56:34,591
[SPEAKER_24]: All right.

1509
01:56:50,446 --> 01:57:01,228
[SPEAKER_23]: Again, if you enjoy Bomani remixes, then might I urge you to tune in to Diversion, the Orange Launch Radio remix show, which airs every Monday night at 7 o'clock Pacific Standard Time on our station.

1510
01:57:01,768 --> 01:57:02,228
[SPEAKER_23]: Check it out.

1511
01:57:02,768 --> 01:57:08,369
[SPEAKER_23]: And, of course, this week will be the first question in that show for the Akira Yamaoka signed CD contest.

1512
01:57:08,389 --> 01:57:12,530
[SPEAKER_23]: If you're just joining us, check out our website, www.orangenlaunchradio.com, for all the details.

1513
01:57:12,630 --> 01:57:13,130
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, here it is.

1514
01:57:14,410 --> 01:57:15,751
[SPEAKER_23]: Loki's going to spin this for us.

1515
01:57:16,191 --> 01:57:17,211
[SPEAKER_23]: What's this remix called again?

1516
01:57:17,271 --> 01:57:17,371
[SPEAKER_23]: It's...

1517
01:57:18,891 --> 01:57:22,654
[SPEAKER_24]: It's Cigaroo180, and the guy that remixed it's name is Vospy.

1518
01:57:23,334 --> 01:57:27,417
[SPEAKER_24]: And he's got his own site, I really have to search hard to find it.

1519
01:57:27,477 --> 01:57:33,481
[SPEAKER_24]: He's a member on DDRUK, he does a lot of stuff with the Pump It Up scene over there, I guess.

1520
01:57:33,981 --> 01:57:38,704
[SPEAKER_24]: But, yeah, Cigaroo180, and it's only about a little over two minutes.

1521
01:57:38,904 --> 01:57:39,385
[SPEAKER_24]: So, here we go.

1522
01:57:39,405 --> 01:57:41,146
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright, check this out.

1523
01:58:52,342 --> 01:58:54,349
Thank you for watching!

1524
01:59:44,574 --> 01:59:44,954
[SPEAKER_22]: Is that it?

1525
01:59:45,094 --> 01:59:45,875
[SPEAKER_22]: Wow, alright, that's it.

1526
01:59:45,895 --> 01:59:46,996
[SPEAKER_24]: That was pretty neat.

1527
01:59:47,016 --> 01:59:47,517
[SPEAKER_22]: That was pretty cool.

1528
01:59:47,617 --> 01:59:48,998
[SPEAKER_22]: Where can people get a copy of that if they want?

1529
01:59:50,259 --> 01:59:58,766
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, but my style in their sim file section is like, you can just do a search for Cigarro180 and you can find that sim file for it, which isn't that bad actually, I played it last night.

1530
01:59:59,267 --> 02:00:01,929
[SPEAKER_24]: Just, I'm out of practice and my hand cramped up pretty quick.

1531
02:00:03,590 --> 02:00:03,871
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright.

1532
02:00:04,491 --> 02:00:10,136
[SPEAKER_25]: So, I missed me and your, uh, getting, you know, some action then, because you haven't been, uh, taking care of yourself.

1533
02:00:11,147 --> 02:00:14,228
[SPEAKER_25]: If your hand, you're not... My wrist is fine, it's my hand that's not.

1534
02:00:14,628 --> 02:00:16,408
[SPEAKER_25]: He said his wrist is fine, it's his hand that's not.

1535
02:00:17,228 --> 02:00:17,528
[SPEAKER_23]: Anyway.

1536
02:00:17,588 --> 02:00:18,108
[SPEAKER_23]: I see.

1537
02:00:19,569 --> 02:00:22,649
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright, let's get to the winner of tonight's cage match, shall we?

1538
02:00:22,669 --> 02:00:24,629
[SPEAKER_23]: We took some votes while that song was on.

1539
02:00:24,669 --> 02:00:26,030
[SPEAKER_23]: You guys ready to hear tonight's winner?

1540
02:00:26,450 --> 02:00:27,490
[SPEAKER_23]: What do you guys think won?

1541
02:00:28,110 --> 02:00:28,690
[SPEAKER_23]: I always pull.

1542
02:00:28,890 --> 02:00:30,531
[SPEAKER_23]: I would say the third song definitely won.

1543
02:00:31,311 --> 02:00:33,891
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, let's see if it was a shocker tonight.

1544
02:00:34,551 --> 02:00:37,032
[SPEAKER_23]: Tonight's winner was not a shocker.

1545
02:00:37,052 --> 02:00:38,092
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright.

1546
02:00:41,280 --> 02:00:42,120
[SPEAKER_23]: It was close, though.

1547
02:00:42,160 --> 02:00:46,822
[SPEAKER_24]: The votes were very... ...the worst piece of shit I can find next week.

1548
02:00:47,763 --> 02:00:49,463
[SPEAKER_24]: Hey, sing the song.

1549
02:00:49,483 --> 02:00:52,104
[SPEAKER_23]: And I remind you, you just had a song retired.

1550
02:00:52,164 --> 02:00:56,546
[SPEAKER_23]: It's time to let Jamie and I bounce some back and forth for a little while, so... Alright.

1551
02:00:58,183 --> 02:01:00,465
[SPEAKER_23]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1552
02:01:27,223 --> 02:01:31,726
[SPEAKER_24]: It's Guitar Freaks and Dromania V. V standing for Vest.

1553
02:01:32,226 --> 02:01:33,787
[SPEAKER_24]: That still doesn't make any sense, though.

1554
02:01:34,307 --> 02:01:38,689
[SPEAKER_24]: But what the theme is going to be for this release is going to be gears and machinery.

1555
02:01:38,769 --> 02:01:41,350
[SPEAKER_24]: So you're going to see some pretty kick-ass interfaces, at least.

1556
02:01:42,031 --> 02:01:43,872
[SPEAKER_24]: They're revamping, I guess, the result screen.

1557
02:01:43,892 --> 02:01:45,933
[SPEAKER_24]: It's supposed to be more 3D or something like that.

1558
02:01:46,233 --> 02:01:47,474
[SPEAKER_24]: God knows what they're going to do with that.

1559
02:01:47,874 --> 02:01:54,897
[SPEAKER_24]: The movies that are going to be playing during it, it's going to be something similar to 2DX, where you're going to see full motion video and stuff like that.

1560
02:01:54,937 --> 02:01:55,958
[SPEAKER_25]: That means a hardware upgrade.

1561
02:01:56,403 --> 02:01:58,204
[SPEAKER_24]: It's going to be a hardware upgrade, yes.

1562
02:01:58,264 --> 02:02:01,846
[SPEAKER_24]: It's going to be just like 2DX, 10th Style, and Red.

1563
02:02:01,866 --> 02:02:06,148
[SPEAKER_24]: It's going to be right off of a PC-like hardware system.

1564
02:02:06,628 --> 02:02:11,810
[SPEAKER_24]: The other thing that they were saying it was supposed to be in there is about 230 songs starting, I think.

1565
02:02:12,351 --> 02:02:16,553
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's not including, I think, the unlocks from, you know, obviously the emu stuff.

1566
02:02:17,913 --> 02:02:25,937
[SPEAKER_24]: Other than that, really not much else other than they mentioned a few songs for test locations.

1567
02:02:25,997 --> 02:02:28,178
[SPEAKER_24]: I know that were on there and some licensed stuff.

1568
02:02:29,758 --> 02:02:33,260
[SPEAKER_23]: One song that's being pointed out in our chat room specifically by DarkLionXVI says...

1569
02:02:33,996 --> 02:02:36,497
[SPEAKER_23]: Mysterilou, which was the theme from Pulp Fiction.

1570
02:02:55,988 --> 02:02:57,991
[SPEAKER_23]: Actually, I think I know who this is that's calling.

1571
02:02:58,051 --> 02:02:58,972
[SPEAKER_23]: Actually, hold on, let me take this.

1572
02:02:59,572 --> 02:03:00,714
[SPEAKER_23]: Keep telling us about Guitar Restart Mania.

1573
02:03:01,835 --> 02:03:04,057
[SPEAKER_21]: Why don't we have a cage match one week with ringtones?

1574
02:03:05,078 --> 02:03:07,982
[SPEAKER_24]: Anyways, this is a game where you play the guitar and beat the drums.

1575
02:03:10,472 --> 02:03:11,333
[SPEAKER_24]: So, how's that?

1576
02:03:11,353 --> 02:03:16,496
[SPEAKER_24]: I was going to look on the list here and see what we've got for Guitar Freaks.

1577
02:03:17,417 --> 02:03:19,038
[SPEAKER_24]: Some new Dezbro songs.

1578
02:03:19,098 --> 02:03:21,660
[SPEAKER_24]: We've got Endless Cruising, which sounds pretty cool.

1579
02:03:21,720 --> 02:03:22,861
[SPEAKER_24]: Mushroom Boy by Pooh.

1580
02:03:23,502 --> 02:03:24,362
[SPEAKER_24]: Everyone loves Pooh.

1581
02:03:25,063 --> 02:03:26,904
[SPEAKER_24]: And Going Up by Colors.

1582
02:03:27,545 --> 02:03:31,127
[SPEAKER_23]: I just want to say it's awesome that there's a band called Pooh in Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania.

1583
02:03:31,948 --> 02:03:33,109
[SPEAKER_24]: What song are you going to play?

1584
02:03:33,469 --> 02:03:33,889
[SPEAKER_24]: Pooh?

1585
02:03:35,504 --> 02:03:52,396
[SPEAKER_24]: And as we were mentioning before, Mizorilou or whatever that is Mizorilou is Spaghetti Surfers Wild Challenger by Jindo NGS by Asian Kung Fu Generation Nocturne No.

1586
02:03:52,416 --> 02:03:53,777
[SPEAKER_24]: 9 sounds like, you know, No.

1587
02:03:53,797 --> 02:04:03,443
[SPEAKER_24]: 9 But by some Japanese group here And the extra stage will be Heaven's Cocktail By Big Five

1588
02:04:05,689 --> 02:04:09,692
[SPEAKER_15]: and... Heaven's Cocktail.

1589
02:04:10,292 --> 02:04:12,514
[SPEAKER_21]: Did you get one of those cool little umbrella things with it too?

1590
02:04:14,516 --> 02:04:14,896
[SPEAKER_24]: Maybe.

1591
02:04:15,696 --> 02:04:17,978
[SPEAKER_24]: But anyway, so yeah, that's kind of what's going on.

1592
02:04:18,999 --> 02:04:24,863
[SPEAKER_24]: Link to the Konami test page or whatever on OrangeLawsRadio.com.

1593
02:04:25,714 --> 02:04:28,576
[SPEAKER_23]: So if you can read Japanese, you'll definitely get a kick out of this site.

1594
02:04:28,897 --> 02:04:31,099
[SPEAKER_24]: Also, pictures are on the page.

1595
02:04:31,779 --> 02:04:32,280
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, okay, cool.

1596
02:04:32,400 --> 02:04:34,361
[SPEAKER_23]: I also can't remember if we linked to this or not.

1597
02:04:34,482 --> 02:04:36,463
[SPEAKER_23]: I actually don't think I ran a story on it.

1598
02:04:36,483 --> 02:04:37,544
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm going to have to tomorrow.

1599
02:04:38,225 --> 02:04:42,488
[SPEAKER_23]: I did pick wind, though, that Konami is doing another survey.

1600
02:04:42,969 --> 02:04:44,210
[SPEAKER_23]: Remember how they did a big survey?

1601
02:04:44,230 --> 02:04:46,832
[SPEAKER_23]: They were putting their feelers out there for a 2DX7 style?

1602
02:04:47,172 --> 02:04:52,317
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, this time the game they're taking surveys for, Karaoke Revolution, Bamani Edition.

1603
02:04:54,402 --> 02:05:00,157
[SPEAKER_23]: In Japan, they are putting out the feelers right now for a karaoke revolution edition with all Bomani songs in it.

1604
02:05:00,919 --> 02:05:02,282
[SPEAKER_23]: Wouldn't that be something else?

1605
02:05:02,728 --> 02:05:05,829
[SPEAKER_21]: It'd just be like watching DDR3rd Mix all over again.

1606
02:05:05,870 --> 02:05:07,350
[SPEAKER_23]: Seriously, that's basically what it is.

1607
02:05:08,351 --> 02:05:09,491
[SPEAKER_23]: More info on that to follow.

1608
02:05:09,531 --> 02:05:11,132
[SPEAKER_23]: We don't know a whole lot about that right now.

1609
02:05:11,192 --> 02:05:14,314
[SPEAKER_23]: All we know is that I think they were looking for 3,000, which isn't a very big number.

1610
02:05:14,774 --> 02:05:18,836
[SPEAKER_23]: So, it looks like that'll probably happen, the Karaoke Revolution Bomani Edition.

1611
02:05:19,216 --> 02:05:21,257
[SPEAKER_23]: And for some people, it'll finally be an excuse for them to play.

1612
02:05:21,557 --> 02:05:26,900
[SPEAKER_23]: And maybe those kids that were trying to get Murmur Twins in Karaoke Revolution will finally get their way.

1613
02:05:28,680 --> 02:05:31,182
[SPEAKER_23]: Which would be very interesting, I think, if Murmur Twins made it in there.

1614
02:05:31,202 --> 02:05:31,922
[SPEAKER_23]: We'll have to see.

1615
02:05:34,351 --> 02:05:35,731
[SPEAKER_24]: They need to put this in here.

1616
02:05:35,751 --> 02:05:38,352
[SPEAKER_24]: What was that?

1617
02:05:40,092 --> 02:05:41,732
[SPEAKER_24]: Naha and Gachikun.

1618
02:05:42,192 --> 02:05:45,853
[SPEAKER_15]: That'd be great.

1619
02:05:48,153 --> 02:05:50,254
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, so there's not too much going on.

1620
02:05:50,594 --> 02:05:55,795
[SPEAKER_24]: We're still waiting to hear more about Dancing Stage Fusion, the arcade mix, because that's going to be the huge news to come out.

1621
02:05:56,275 --> 02:06:00,696
[SPEAKER_24]: Because, you know, if Europe's doing it, then, well, guess what?

1622
02:06:00,736 --> 02:06:03,256
[SPEAKER_24]: The hardware's done, so all they've got to do is make the game.

1623
02:06:04,221 --> 02:06:06,742
[SPEAKER_24]: or another game for another region, you know, Japan.

1624
02:06:07,302 --> 02:06:16,065
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm surprised that we're not seeing a new arcade mix for Japan, because, I mean, it's not that hard to make it once the hardware's done or whatever, but, you know, hey, whatever.

1625
02:06:17,485 --> 02:06:18,465
[SPEAKER_24]: So, it'll be interesting.

1626
02:06:18,985 --> 02:06:29,609
[SPEAKER_24]: At least, maybe we'll see some arcades import that over here, because they'll get desperate and not wanting to wait any longer and not wanting to buy in the groove, so, yeah.

1627
02:06:29,629 --> 02:06:30,549
More than desperate to lose an XP+,

1628
02:06:33,184 --> 02:06:34,867
[SPEAKER_23]: is saying something about DanceHouse Extreme Plus.

1629
02:06:34,887 --> 02:06:36,049
[SPEAKER_23]: That's really in town now?

1630
02:06:36,450 --> 02:06:37,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it's CCL.

1631
02:06:37,331 --> 02:06:37,892
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, God.

1632
02:06:39,054 --> 02:06:47,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, DDR Extreme Plus, or the so-called Knicks that they claim is new, it's actually on CCL, Country Club Lanes.

1633
02:06:47,337 --> 02:06:50,058
[SPEAKER_23]: Interesting, our local bowling alley, where DDR was born here in Sacramento.

1634
02:06:50,358 --> 02:06:50,878
[SPEAKER_23]: Very interesting.

1635
02:06:51,378 --> 02:06:52,518
[SPEAKER_23]: I kind of want to check that out.

1636
02:06:52,758 --> 02:06:58,020
[SPEAKER_23]: You know what's very cool about Country Club Lanes here in Sacramento, our bowling alley where DDR was born here in this area?

1637
02:06:58,980 --> 02:07:02,481
[SPEAKER_23]: It's 24 hours, which makes it very cool for DDR, because it's open 24 hours.

1638
02:07:02,882 --> 02:07:05,362
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, but there still is a night you have to pay the cover charge to get in.

1639
02:07:05,422 --> 02:07:07,343
[SPEAKER_23]: That's very true, that's very true, and that sucks.

1640
02:07:09,494 --> 02:07:15,839
[SPEAKER_24]: I remember, I mean, back in the day, we used to hang out, like, till midnight and go play DDR till 3 in the morning.

1641
02:07:17,560 --> 02:07:19,241
[SPEAKER_23]: I remember the days of glow bowling.

1642
02:07:19,802 --> 02:07:21,843
[SPEAKER_23]: I remember the days when we would go... We need to do that.

1643
02:07:21,883 --> 02:07:23,204
[SPEAKER_23]: We seriously need to go glow bowling.

1644
02:07:23,244 --> 02:07:27,748
[SPEAKER_23]: Remember back in the day, right when Rocky Horror first died and the sacramentals were coming together?

1645
02:07:27,868 --> 02:07:30,129
[SPEAKER_26]: I remember you, you and me, and Mel and Melody all went.

1646
02:07:30,650 --> 02:07:32,371
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, I do remember that quite vividly.

1647
02:07:32,411 --> 02:07:35,834
[SPEAKER_26]: And we were like, duh, tired.

1648
02:07:36,775 --> 02:07:40,840
[SPEAKER_23]: I remember going and we'd go and then we'd play DDR and that was back when they still had, I think, a 1.5 mix.

1649
02:07:40,880 --> 02:07:45,344
[SPEAKER_23]: I seem to recall that... I remember being assaulted on the 1.5 machine.

1650
02:07:45,605 --> 02:07:45,885
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah.

1651
02:07:46,145 --> 02:07:46,646
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, that's fun.

1652
02:07:47,247 --> 02:07:47,587
[SPEAKER_21]: Good time.

1653
02:07:47,627 --> 02:07:50,410
[SPEAKER_21]: I think when we went it was actually up to a fifth mix at the time.

1654
02:07:50,630 --> 02:07:50,871
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah.

1655
02:07:51,151 --> 02:07:51,231
[SPEAKER_23]: Ugh.

1656
02:07:52,156 --> 02:07:53,657
[SPEAKER_26]: I believe in good service, thank you.

1657
02:08:20,543 --> 02:08:22,024
[SPEAKER_23]: Good memories there.

1658
02:08:22,364 --> 02:08:24,445
[SPEAKER_23]: Any location that has 24-hour DDR is fun.

1659
02:08:24,505 --> 02:08:28,126
[SPEAKER_26]: Any place now is completely at my mercy now that I've got my business law book.

1660
02:08:30,307 --> 02:08:34,989
[SPEAKER_26]: Because now I could have sued them for not fulfilling their duty of utmost care.

1661
02:08:38,010 --> 02:08:38,630
[SPEAKER_22]: Don't mess with her.

1662
02:08:38,650 --> 02:08:39,651
[SPEAKER_22]: She's got a law book now.

1663
02:08:40,271 --> 02:08:40,571
[SPEAKER_22]: Damn.

1664
02:08:41,653 --> 02:08:47,074
[SPEAKER_23]: So very interesting, though, going back to the fact that Dancing Stage Fusion is going to be having a brand new cabinet coming out.

1665
02:08:47,794 --> 02:08:49,555
[SPEAKER_23]: Could be very good sign for DDR.

1666
02:08:49,635 --> 02:08:50,775
[SPEAKER_23]: Could be just a red herring.

1667
02:08:50,815 --> 02:08:51,155
[SPEAKER_23]: Who knows?

1668
02:08:51,395 --> 02:08:52,095
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, you never know.

1669
02:08:52,155 --> 02:08:53,735
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, also, you've got to think of it like this.

1670
02:08:54,776 --> 02:09:01,977
[SPEAKER_21]: When they did DDR Extreme, they even mentioned as much, like in concert, I believe, they said they had to take a break from DDR because, you know, for whatever reason.

1671
02:09:02,057 --> 02:09:06,518
[SPEAKER_21]: And it was at the point where they had created a DDR mix like once a year, practically, and

1672
02:09:07,249 --> 02:09:11,473
[SPEAKER_23]: I think we got like 4th and 5th mix in the same year.

1673
02:09:11,854 --> 02:09:14,717
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh yeah, you had 4th and then you had 4th Plus come out and then 5th.

1674
02:09:14,737 --> 02:09:15,958
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, that's right.

1675
02:09:16,018 --> 02:09:19,381
[SPEAKER_23]: It was like 4th, 4th Plus, and then like 5th and Max came out in the same year, I think.

1676
02:09:19,561 --> 02:09:23,025
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, so I think it was long overdue, at least just for a little time off.

1677
02:09:23,065 --> 02:09:27,669
[SPEAKER_21]: So it wouldn't surprise me the least bit to see a new DDR come out.

1678
02:09:27,929 --> 02:09:28,210
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean...

1679
02:09:29,131 --> 02:09:30,213
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, that's just how it works.

1680
02:09:39,409 --> 02:09:52,134
[SPEAKER_23]: Seeing how 2DX and Guitar Freaks Drum Mania have been cranking out babies and all that kind of stuff I think it's a good thing that Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania is getting an overhaul though Because honestly, it was getting to a point when they got, like what are they on, like 11th mix now?

1681
02:09:52,695 --> 02:10:02,239
[SPEAKER_23]: I just, yeah, it's been the same damn game since 5th mix, just with different songs It's kind of got to the point where it's like, oh, Guitar Freaks is getting a new mix, oh, you know, must be Monday You know, it's like

1682
02:10:03,635 --> 02:10:03,795
[SPEAKER_23]: DDR1?

1683
02:10:03,835 --> 02:10:04,175
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, DDR Hawaii?

1684
02:10:04,195 --> 02:10:04,456
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, usually...

1685
02:10:31,216 --> 02:10:45,800
[SPEAKER_21]: Usually, I'm not sure about arcade mixes, because as far as, I mean, as far as, like, say, home console versions, like KSET, I believe, does, like, there's actually, the AM division is different than the console division.

1686
02:10:46,240 --> 02:10:53,001
[SPEAKER_21]: So, I mean, as far as, like, programming, all that kind of stuff, Hawaii doesn't really have that much say, I don't think, as far as arcade releases.

1687
02:10:53,061 --> 02:10:55,662
[SPEAKER_21]: As far as, like, home version, of course, they got the lockdown on that.

1688
02:10:56,728 --> 02:10:57,128
[SPEAKER_22]: Interesting.

1689
02:10:57,528 --> 02:10:59,369
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, it'll be interesting to see what happens.

1690
02:10:59,769 --> 02:11:10,072
[SPEAKER_23]: Because a lot of people, just with the developments with Ultramix 2 and the license, they said, you know, I've heard people say this, if DDR comes out again in the USA, Hawaii needs to be involved.

1691
02:11:10,452 --> 02:11:11,492
[SPEAKER_23]: Hawaii definitely needs to be involved.

1692
02:11:11,652 --> 02:11:13,953
[SPEAKER_23]: Which is amazing, considering that Ultramix 2 hasn't even come out yet.

1693
02:11:14,573 --> 02:11:15,513
[SPEAKER_23]: But, we'll see.

1694
02:11:16,573 --> 02:11:19,694
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, it's, I mean, there's a lot of things going into Ultramix 2 that are different.

1695
02:11:19,794 --> 02:11:22,835
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, obviously, some people give Hawaii credit for

1696
02:11:23,382 --> 02:11:25,263
[SPEAKER_21]: And of course going kind of a slightly different direction.

1697
02:11:25,864 --> 02:11:34,409
[SPEAKER_21]: Some people can point out to the fact that this time they got even more DDR knowledgeable people to QA and not only that work on step data.

1698
02:11:34,429 --> 02:11:41,434
[SPEAKER_21]: So this is very much like fans having even more, or like players having more of a say into what goes into a game.

1699
02:11:42,808 --> 02:11:51,256
[SPEAKER_21]: If that's the direction how DDR as far as the Ultra Mix franchise is concerned, then it's definitely going to have its own identity very shortly.

1700
02:11:51,737 --> 02:11:53,459
[SPEAKER_21]: People will see that as soon as they get it.

1701
02:11:55,609 --> 02:11:56,030
[SPEAKER_23]: Very good.

1702
02:11:56,270 --> 02:11:56,530
[SPEAKER_23]: All right.

1703
02:11:57,571 --> 02:11:58,252
[SPEAKER_23]: I guess we're going to do now.

1704
02:11:58,272 --> 02:11:59,373
[SPEAKER_23]: I think now is a good time to take a break.

1705
02:11:59,473 --> 02:12:02,095
[SPEAKER_23]: And when we come back, we're going to get into the FUs of the week.

1706
02:12:02,155 --> 02:12:08,080
[SPEAKER_23]: So if you want to send some FUs in over private message to Sky in the chat room, we will make sure we get those read on air for you.

1707
02:12:08,461 --> 02:12:14,086
[SPEAKER_23]: We're going to continue to play some full-length versions that we found on the Internet of brand-new Ultramix 2 songs.

1708
02:12:14,126 --> 02:12:15,427
[SPEAKER_23]: And this one should take you back.

1709
02:12:15,767 --> 02:12:18,350
[SPEAKER_23]: This is one I did not recognize until I actually listened to it.

1710
02:12:18,390 --> 02:12:19,511
[SPEAKER_23]: I did not recognize it by the name.

1711
02:12:19,531 --> 02:12:20,592
[SPEAKER_23]: But then when I started listening to it, I'm like...

1712
02:12:21,092 --> 02:12:22,214
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh my god, this song!

1713
02:12:22,714 --> 02:12:25,458
[SPEAKER_23]: This is Don't Stop by the Freestylers.

1714
02:12:26,400 --> 02:12:26,860
[SPEAKER_23]: Enjoy this.

1715
02:12:26,880 --> 02:12:28,082
[SPEAKER_23]: This is going to be an ultra mix too.

1716
02:12:28,102 --> 02:12:28,382
[SPEAKER_23]: Enjoy.

1717
02:12:28,403 --> 02:12:28,903
[SPEAKER_23]: We'll be back.

1718
02:12:29,244 --> 02:12:29,865
[SPEAKER_23]: Orange Lounge Radio.

1719
02:14:05,142 --> 02:14:06,225
Thank you for watching!

1720
02:15:48,588 --> 02:15:50,416
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks for watching!

[SPEAKER_01]: Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.

1723
02:17:08,328 --> 02:17:08,849
[SPEAKER_23]: Thanks for watching!

1724
02:17:24,363 --> 02:17:24,784
[SPEAKER_23]: Very cool.

1725

[SPEAKER_23]: And of course, lots and lots of spin-off shows on Orange Launch Radio for your listening pleasure.

1728
02:17:34,778 --> 02:17:36,761

1729
02:17:36,781 --> 02:17:37,682
[SPEAKER_26]: The occasional marathon.

1730
02:17:37,802 --> 02:17:38,683
[SPEAKER_23]: The occasional marathon.

1731
02:17:38,804 --> 02:17:39,825
[SPEAKER_26]: I do marathon stuff.

1732
02:17:40,065 --> 02:17:40,426
[SPEAKER_23]: That's right.

1733
02:17:41,268 --> 02:17:43,169
[SPEAKER_23]: Didn't you marathon at ESR the other day?

1734
02:17:43,209 --> 02:17:49,092
[SPEAKER_26]: No, last week I did the Strong Bad Things again.

1735
02:17:49,272 --> 02:17:49,552
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, yes.

1736
02:17:50,573 --> 02:17:51,673
[SPEAKER_23]: I actually tuned in for part of that.

1737
02:17:51,693 --> 02:17:52,253
[SPEAKER_23]: I heard some of that.

1738
02:17:52,273 --> 02:17:52,854
[SPEAKER_23]: It was pretty good.

1739
02:17:53,454 --> 02:17:53,814
[SPEAKER_23]: Good stuff.

1740
02:17:54,274 --> 02:18:00,858
[SPEAKER_23]: And then Wednesday night's going to be now, not going to be the Orange Lounge Radio Rewind anymore since those are moving over to the Freak.

1741
02:18:01,458 --> 02:18:08,901
[SPEAKER_23]: It's going to be the classic, moldy episodes, freshly fermented for your listening pleasure, year-old episodes of Orange Lounge Radio.

1742
02:18:10,343 --> 02:18:13,422
[SPEAKER_23]: and Thursday nights on this station outside the box.

1743
02:18:14,656 --> 02:18:18,777
[SPEAKER_23]: My program dedicated to all that other random video game stuff.

1744
02:18:18,837 --> 02:18:20,597
[SPEAKER_23]: So definitely check it out if you haven't yet.

1745
02:18:21,537 --> 02:18:24,918
[SPEAKER_23]: Now we must get to one of those Orange Lounge Radio Live staples.

1746
02:18:25,518 --> 02:18:28,499
[SPEAKER_23]: That thing we have to do every week where we get out that angst.

1747
02:18:28,599 --> 02:18:34,020
[SPEAKER_23]: And for those of you guys that are new to this program, I know there might be some of you guys that are listening to this on DDR3 Radio for the first time.

1748
02:18:34,420 --> 02:18:37,701
[SPEAKER_23]: Those of you guys that are new to the program are going to hear this every week.

1749
02:18:38,361 --> 02:18:39,321
[SPEAKER_23]: The FUs of the week.

1750
02:18:39,401 --> 02:18:43,022
[SPEAKER_23]: And Jamie, why is it that we have to do these FUs of the week every single week?

1751
02:18:43,882 --> 02:18:46,104
[SPEAKER_26]: Because we're not going to take it anymore.

1752
02:19:01,749 --> 02:19:05,370
[SPEAKER_26]: The first F you goes to my allergies for flaring up.

1753
02:19:06,350 --> 02:19:08,851
[SPEAKER_26]: The second goes to Benadryl for making me sleepy.

1754
02:19:09,951 --> 02:19:12,492
[SPEAKER_26]: Also, for some reason, my jaw hurts.

1755
02:19:13,072 --> 02:19:14,572
[SPEAKER_26]: Like, the joints in my jaws.

1756
02:19:16,072 --> 02:19:18,553
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, I've got all this sinus pressure in my head.

1757
02:19:19,153 --> 02:19:21,153
[SPEAKER_26]: That means that I'm likely going to bed early.

1758
02:19:22,834 --> 02:19:25,474
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't drink tariff, nor do I have any at the house.

1759
02:19:25,714 --> 02:19:27,575
[SPEAKER_26]: I have prescription drugs that are doing shit.

1760
02:19:28,935 --> 02:19:29,015
[SPEAKER_26]: Oof.

1761
02:19:32,276 --> 02:19:34,117
[SPEAKER_26]: But I'm probably going to be going to sleep early tonight.

1762
02:19:34,377 --> 02:19:41,058
[SPEAKER_26]: A big F you toward having to work on this ethics project.

1763
02:19:45,799 --> 02:19:48,119
[SPEAKER_26]: F you to the sneezes that don't happen.

1764
02:19:51,660 --> 02:19:53,060
[SPEAKER_26]: F you to stupid people in traffic.

1765
02:19:54,100 --> 02:19:57,661
[SPEAKER_26]: F you to the doctor who put my arm in a cast.

1766
02:19:58,321 --> 02:20:00,241
[SPEAKER_26]: I cut that shit off of branch cutters.

1767
02:20:01,997 --> 02:20:02,978
[SPEAKER_26]: My hand still hurts.

1768
02:20:03,298 --> 02:20:09,665
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, another F you to my cat, Shermie, for being in a big feeding frenzy so that I'd trip over her while wearing socks in the kitchen.

1769
02:20:10,726 --> 02:20:11,306
[SPEAKER_26]: Last Sunday.

1770
02:20:12,528 --> 02:20:17,472
[SPEAKER_26]: Just, in general, just massive F yous to just about everything.

1771
02:20:19,595 --> 02:20:20,876
[SPEAKER_26]: I think that will cover everything.

1772
02:20:21,517 --> 02:20:21,837
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright.

1773
02:20:22,818 --> 02:20:23,779
[SPEAKER_23]: Loki, your turn.

1774
02:20:27,678 --> 02:20:28,559
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, my God.

1775
02:20:28,619 --> 02:20:32,024
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, as if I don't complain about them enough.

1776
02:20:33,783 --> 02:20:34,103
[SPEAKER_24]: Yay!

1777
02:20:34,143 --> 02:20:35,844
[SPEAKER_24]: You did it again, Comcast!

1778
02:20:35,864 --> 02:20:38,945
[SPEAKER_24]: You just find a way to fuck everything up again!

1779
02:20:39,426 --> 02:20:40,546
[SPEAKER_24]: Way to go, G4!

1780
02:20:40,706 --> 02:20:41,487
[SPEAKER_24]: Because you know what?

1781
02:20:41,527 --> 02:20:48,250
[SPEAKER_24]: There wasn't quite enough crap on there yet, so you had to get rid of the, like, good stuff, you know, to fit more crap in there.

1782
02:20:48,850 --> 02:20:57,094
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry for all those people that used to be part of TechTV that got sucked into G4 and then fired, because you're talented.

1783
02:20:57,814 --> 02:20:58,634
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, you know what?

1784
02:20:58,914 --> 02:21:01,255
[SPEAKER_24]: They don't want to make G4 look bad, so guess what?

1785
02:21:01,315 --> 02:21:02,015
[SPEAKER_24]: Bye-bye!

1786
02:21:02,475 --> 02:21:03,855
[SPEAKER_24]: Bye-bye, screensavers!

1787
02:21:03,915 --> 02:21:04,876
[SPEAKER_24]: Bye-bye, Unscrewed!

1788
02:21:04,916 --> 02:21:07,916
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, screensavers will still be there, but it ain't screensavers anymore.

1789
02:21:08,796 --> 02:21:09,536
[SPEAKER_24]: And, you know what?

1790
02:21:09,837 --> 02:21:11,197
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm... And you know what sucks, too?

1791
02:21:11,237 --> 02:21:16,578
[SPEAKER_24]: Is I heard that the people... Actually, some of the good shows on G4, like Cheat and stuff... Oh, those guys got fired, too!

1792
02:21:17,198 --> 02:21:17,938
[SPEAKER_24]: So, guess what?

1793
02:21:18,258 --> 02:21:20,599
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, the hell with all the good stuff on G4!

1794
02:21:20,779 --> 02:21:25,880
[SPEAKER_24]: I will not be watching G4 anymore unless to catch the last episode of Unscrewed, if they ever air it...

1795
02:21:26,460 --> 02:21:30,323
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you Loki for destroying any possible opportunity we ever had of taking Orange Lounge TV on the air.

1796
02:21:30,343 --> 02:21:30,643
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1797
02:21:58,211 --> 02:21:58,552
[SPEAKER_24]: Listen.

1798
02:22:00,775 --> 02:22:07,586
[SPEAKER_24]: Listen, I'm not going to want to be associated with anything on that station because, uh, you know, it just does not have enough halo in that show.

1799
02:22:08,328 --> 02:22:09,469
[SPEAKER_24]: So, um, no.

1800
02:22:09,570 --> 02:22:11,052
[SPEAKER_24]: Anyways, um, so fuck them.

1801
02:22:11,553 --> 02:22:12,454
[SPEAKER_24]: And, um, fuck...

1802
02:22:13,214 --> 02:22:16,515
[SPEAKER_24]: My headache, because it sucks, but it's starting to go away, so that's kind of good.

1803
02:22:17,535 --> 02:22:19,516
[SPEAKER_24]: Fuck Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.

1804
02:22:19,996 --> 02:22:23,677
[SPEAKER_24]: And more specifically, the Woozimo mission.

1805
02:22:23,817 --> 02:22:24,997
[SPEAKER_24]: I can't fucking beat it!

1806
02:22:25,377 --> 02:22:25,998
[SPEAKER_24]: It's annoying!

1807
02:22:26,318 --> 02:22:32,399
[SPEAKER_24]: Why does anyone... Okay, why do street racers, Japanese street racers, come to town to have an off-road street race?

1808
02:22:33,140 --> 02:22:37,221
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry, but, you know, people that drive, you know, those racers, don't drive off-road, okay?

1809
02:22:37,281 --> 02:22:41,622
[SPEAKER_24]: The racers were not made for off-road, so... Why do they have a race that goes off-road?

1810
02:22:41,642 --> 02:22:41,962
[SPEAKER_24]: That sucks.

1811
02:22:43,127 --> 02:22:49,112
[SPEAKER_24]: And, um, finally... Fuck you again, the G4, because you suck!

1812
02:22:49,733 --> 02:22:50,333
[SPEAKER_24]: I hate you!

1813
02:22:50,834 --> 02:22:52,635
[SPEAKER_24]: I hate you, I hate you, I hate you!

1814
02:22:53,556 --> 02:23:00,142
[SPEAKER_24]: That's it.

1815
02:23:03,044 --> 02:23:04,966
[SPEAKER_23]: I just want to give a special message to Comcast.

1816
02:23:04,986 --> 02:23:05,266
[SPEAKER_23]: You know what?

1817
02:23:05,286 --> 02:23:10,270
[SPEAKER_23]: Despite what Loki says, I will still sell out faster than Divine Brown, okay?

1818
02:23:10,450 --> 02:23:11,171
[SPEAKER_23]: I just want you to know...

1819
02:23:13,143 --> 02:23:14,743
[SPEAKER_23]: and I have this great concept.

1820
02:23:15,003 --> 02:23:18,184
[SPEAKER_23]: I have this wonderful concept for a gay gaming show.

1821
02:23:18,204 --> 02:23:19,605
[SPEAKER_23]: We could call it Gamers.

1822
02:23:19,725 --> 02:23:20,245
[SPEAKER_23]: Think about it.

1823
02:23:21,105 --> 02:23:21,605
[SPEAKER_23]: Think about it.

1824
02:23:22,165 --> 02:23:22,605
[SPEAKER_23]: You want me.

1825
02:23:22,645 --> 02:23:23,146
[SPEAKER_23]: You know you do.

1826
02:23:24,766 --> 02:23:25,686
[SPEAKER_23]: I would take Jamie with me.

1827
02:23:25,746 --> 02:23:27,347
[SPEAKER_23]: Loki gets left behind, though, after that remark.

1828
02:23:27,707 --> 02:23:29,387
[SPEAKER_26]: Does that mean that you have to have the hag co-host?

1829
02:23:29,427 --> 02:23:31,088
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, you would be my official fag hag co-host.

1830
02:23:31,228 --> 02:23:32,888
[SPEAKER_26]: Cool.

1831
02:23:34,088 --> 02:23:34,388
[SPEAKER_23]: All right.

1832
02:23:35,509 --> 02:23:39,270
[SPEAKER_23]: And Loki can polish my shoes for all I care.

1833
02:23:39,290 --> 02:23:39,610
[SPEAKER_23]: All right.

1834
02:23:40,723 --> 02:23:42,444
[SPEAKER_23]: Anyway, on to my FUs, my actual FUs of the week.

1835
02:23:42,464 --> 02:23:44,126
[SPEAKER_26]: You can be the angry hetero guy in the corner.

1836
02:23:44,246 --> 02:23:45,367
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah.

1837
02:23:45,447 --> 02:24:00,479
[SPEAKER_23]: My FUs go to being sick, because I've been very sick all weekend, and it sucks, because remember I was sitting here last week, and I took a poll how many people were sick, and half the people were sick, and I said, gee, the rest of us feel like we just got a death sentence, like we're waiting to get sick.

1838
02:24:00,779 --> 02:24:01,580
[SPEAKER_23]: Sure enough, I got sick.

1839
02:24:01,900 --> 02:24:06,364
[SPEAKER_23]: It wasn't quite as bad, like I think the strain kind of got weaker as it went along, so I can't bitch too much.

1840
02:24:06,824 --> 02:24:08,185
[SPEAKER_23]: But being sick still sucks.

1841
02:24:08,305 --> 02:24:09,985
[SPEAKER_23]: I just want to get that out there.

1842
02:24:10,246 --> 02:24:13,527
[SPEAKER_23]: But what I really want to say on FU2 is FU to those guys on Halo 2.

1843
02:24:13,907 --> 02:24:14,667
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh my god!

1844
02:24:15,028 --> 02:24:17,309
[SPEAKER_23]: I got invited into this match on Xbox Live.

1845
02:24:17,929 --> 02:24:20,610
[SPEAKER_23]: One of my friends, somebody on my friends list on Xbox.

1846
02:24:20,850 --> 02:24:24,051
[SPEAKER_23]: You know how like the people on your friends list, you sometimes don't know them that well?

1847
02:24:24,472 --> 02:24:25,672
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, I had one of these guys.

1848
02:24:26,172 --> 02:24:29,114
[SPEAKER_23]: Then he invited me into his game and he had like all these experts in there.

1849
02:24:29,154 --> 02:24:31,175
[SPEAKER_23]: And I guess they were having tryouts for their clan.

1850
02:24:31,975 --> 02:24:34,236
[SPEAKER_23]: And for some reason they wanted me to try out for their clan.

1851
02:24:36,129 --> 02:24:42,050
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, like, we were playing one of those team games that was King of the Hill, and I'd never played that version before, so I didn't know what I was doing.

1852
02:24:42,290 --> 02:24:45,391
[SPEAKER_23]: And my teammates were yelling at me, and they were like, Don't you know what you're doing?

1853
02:24:45,631 --> 02:24:48,011
[SPEAKER_22]: Come on, Green Sky, what the hell's wrong with you?

1854
02:24:48,791 --> 02:24:50,352
[SPEAKER_23]: And I'm just like, I wanted to cry.

1855
02:24:50,532 --> 02:24:52,852
[SPEAKER_23]: Like, I was just like, they're yelling at me, and they're being mean to me.

1856
02:24:53,332 --> 02:24:54,012
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know what I'm doing.

1857
02:24:54,052 --> 02:24:54,933
[SPEAKER_23]: Fuck your clan!

1858
02:24:55,573 --> 02:24:57,633
[SPEAKER_23]: You guys are the Ku Klux Klan right now!

1859
02:24:57,653 --> 02:24:58,633
[SPEAKER_23]: That's what you guys are!

1860
02:24:58,993 --> 02:24:59,313
[SPEAKER_26]: Rob.

1861
02:24:59,653 --> 02:24:59,933
[SPEAKER_23]: What?

1862
02:24:59,973 --> 02:25:02,414
[SPEAKER_26]: You need to join the clan that Dan's in, the fuckers.

1863
02:25:03,772 --> 02:25:04,793
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, I'll join that.

1864
02:25:05,273 --> 02:25:07,275
[SPEAKER_23]: Are they going to yell at me if I screw up?

1865
02:25:07,475 --> 02:25:08,135
[SPEAKER_26]: Probably not.

1866
02:25:08,336 --> 02:25:09,657
[SPEAKER_26]: Probably half of them will be drunk.

1867
02:25:11,998 --> 02:25:18,403
[SPEAKER_23]: After that match, though, Flairone, one of our listeners, invited me into one of his matches, and I blew him up a bunch with a rocket, and that made me feel better.

1868
02:25:18,483 --> 02:25:20,505
[SPEAKER_23]: So thank you, Flairone, for letting me take my aggressions out on you.

1869
02:25:21,906 --> 02:25:22,346
[SPEAKER_23]: That's it.

1870
02:25:22,827 --> 02:25:27,851
[SPEAKER_23]: F you to assholes on Halo 2, and F you to people on Xbox Live that when you sign on to the game, they go...

1871
02:25:30,097 --> 02:25:31,658
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, because they think it makes them look cool.

1872
02:25:32,398 --> 02:25:33,639
[SPEAKER_23]: FYI, it doesn't.

1873
02:25:33,779 --> 02:25:34,219
[SPEAKER_23]: Grow up.

1874
02:25:34,500 --> 02:25:34,900
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1875
02:25:37,421 --> 02:25:41,924
[SPEAKER_23]: Moving on, let's see what our other guests in the studio have to say, starting with Floatwalk.

1876
02:25:50,729 --> 02:25:51,869
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, sorry, we can't hear you.

1877
02:25:51,889 --> 02:25:52,310
[SPEAKER_23]: Turn on the mic.

1878
02:25:53,297 --> 02:25:54,117
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh damn, I had no idea.

1879
02:25:54,137 --> 02:25:54,917
[SPEAKER_21]: Sorry about that.

1880
02:25:55,157 --> 02:26:07,440
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, well, it's a pretty tame week of FU's for me, although part of one right now I'm just thinking more than anything is FU to Konami Digital Entertainment America QA department.

1881
02:26:08,200 --> 02:26:12,641
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks for laying me off a lot earlier before the game even passed, you know.

1882
02:26:13,121 --> 02:26:17,142
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, I'll probably get help for even saying it, but there are some things you don't do.

1883
02:26:17,202 --> 02:26:22,183
[SPEAKER_21]: You don't spit in the wind, you don't tug on Superman's cape, and you don't break up a team before the game goes gold.

1884
02:26:23,860 --> 02:26:24,921
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll leave it at that.

1885
02:26:25,121 --> 02:26:30,005
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think Mr. Miklatov can totally get me off, can back me up on that one.

1886
02:26:30,425 --> 02:26:33,788
[SPEAKER_21]: So, yes, I'll leave it very short like that before I really go off.

1887
02:26:35,049 --> 02:26:39,132
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, I think we'll just move right along to Exquisite.

1888
02:26:41,714 --> 02:26:42,995
[SPEAKER_23]: One of the biggest FUs.

1889
02:26:43,015 --> 02:26:44,636
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, six inches from now.

1890
02:26:44,716 --> 02:26:45,097
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1891
02:26:46,178 --> 02:26:46,658
[SPEAKER_23]: Try again.

1892
02:26:46,978 --> 02:26:47,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, okay.

1893
02:26:47,859 --> 02:26:48,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this better right here?

1894
02:26:48,579 --> 02:26:49,260
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, much better.

1895
02:26:50,951 --> 02:26:56,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I'd like to say a big F you to some old guy who rear-ended my fucking car!

1896
02:26:59,541 --> 02:27:00,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh wow!

1897
02:27:01,003 --> 02:27:02,144
[SPEAKER_04]: You rear-ended my car!

1898
02:27:02,525 --> 02:27:03,526
What the hell?

1899
02:27:06,195 --> 02:27:07,036
[SPEAKER_23]: Jamie's trying to nap.

1900
02:27:07,616 --> 02:27:09,837
[SPEAKER_23]: You gotta turn it down a notch, that's alright.

1901
02:27:09,877 --> 02:27:17,962
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry for being so loud, but I was just very pissed off with the fuckin' old fart who fuckin' really entered my car, and it was his fault for moving back.

1902
02:27:18,022 --> 02:27:21,524
[SPEAKER_04]: I moved out first, so it gives me priority to go first.

1903
02:27:22,965 --> 02:27:26,427
[SPEAKER_04]: And the fact he just went, like, around 20 miles an hour backing up?

1904
02:27:28,648 --> 02:27:31,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Just cause you drive an SUV does not mean shit.

1905
02:27:32,113 --> 02:27:39,155
[SPEAKER_04]: There was no scratches in your car, yet you left a big ass dent in my Toyota Corolla 2004 S Silver.

1906
02:27:39,195 --> 02:27:42,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it looks all ugly as hell and I have to pay 200 bucks.

1907
02:27:43,336 --> 02:27:48,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I have to pay 200 bucks off my own money just to get that shit fixed.

1908
02:27:50,078 --> 02:27:57,760
[SPEAKER_04]: And just cause you said, oh, I'm sorry, and run away like it's a hidden run with a bunch of cops around doesn't mean I'm gonna...

1909
02:27:58,790 --> 02:28:05,937
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm on your ass whenever I see you!

1910
02:28:09,500 --> 02:28:14,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, enough with the FUs with the car, because I'll pay that shit up in a few weeks and stuff.

1911
02:28:15,365 --> 02:28:19,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, another FU goes to people playing Halo 2 multiplayer.

1912
02:28:20,389 --> 02:28:20,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey!

1913
02:28:21,690 --> 02:28:24,773
[SPEAKER_15]: No, certain people, certain people.

1914
02:28:26,614 --> 02:28:26,975
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1915
02:28:27,375 --> 02:28:29,676
[SPEAKER_23]: Just because you're touching my balls doesn't mean I'm distracted.

1916
02:28:29,696 --> 02:28:31,657
[SPEAKER_23]: Wow, wow, what, what, what?

1917
02:28:31,717 --> 02:28:34,299
[SPEAKER_23]: Wait, wait, I didn't realize this was a feature in Halo 2.

1918
02:28:35,479 --> 02:28:38,101
[SPEAKER_23]: Wait, whoa, wait a minute, wait a minute.

1919
02:28:39,462 --> 02:28:41,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we see people try to cheat in Halo 2.

1920
02:28:42,283 --> 02:28:43,824
[SPEAKER_04]: So you know what people do in Halo 2?

1921
02:28:44,925 --> 02:28:46,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, if you have to put people around, like, what?

1922
02:28:47,986 --> 02:28:48,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

1923
02:28:48,146 --> 02:28:48,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

1924
02:28:52,262 --> 02:28:54,603
[SPEAKER_23]: Sorry, sorry, we're doing something else over here.

1925
02:28:54,643 --> 02:28:55,623
[SPEAKER_23]: Funny picture on a website.

1926
02:28:55,943 --> 02:28:56,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, interesting.

1927
02:28:57,084 --> 02:29:00,185
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, F you to people who are trying to cheat in Halo 2.

1928
02:29:00,865 --> 02:29:03,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, punching people in the face.

1929
02:29:03,606 --> 02:29:04,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Just try to win a game.

1930
02:29:05,107 --> 02:29:06,307
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a DM game, yo.

1931
02:29:06,327 --> 02:29:09,048
[SPEAKER_04]: If you get your ass kicked, just take the heat.

1932
02:29:09,649 --> 02:29:16,091
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no need to touch people, just touch people, touch people in the balls for a subsexual desire that you guys have.

1933
02:29:16,791 --> 02:29:18,052
[SPEAKER_04]: And no, I'm not like that, so.

1934
02:29:18,852 --> 02:29:19,852
[SPEAKER_04]: If it was a female, that'd be cool.

1935
02:29:22,003 --> 02:29:38,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well, speaking of females, I'd like to say another F you to this one stripper who fucking knee dropped my... Yeah, she, yeah, during, uh, during Gold Club 34, I paid 20 bucks for, uh, for a few lap dances.

1936
02:29:39,223 --> 02:29:41,746
[SPEAKER_04]: It was discounted too, by the way, so I get four.

1937
02:29:44,864 --> 02:29:52,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, it was a cool rap test and all, but the fact that she acted like a knee drop, like, oops!

1938
02:29:55,524 --> 02:30:02,147
[SPEAKER_23]: This is what you get when we're looking at funny pictures of Sephiroth killing Aerith.

1939
02:30:02,867 --> 02:30:04,608
[SPEAKER_23]: We're going to put it up on the TV so you guys can see it.

1940
02:30:04,668 --> 02:30:05,588
[SPEAKER_23]: I just posted it in the chat room.

1941
02:30:05,949 --> 02:30:09,550
[SPEAKER_23]: Somebody made a signature on the G4 Tech TV forum.

1942
02:30:09,950 --> 02:30:20,715
[SPEAKER_23]: It's Sephiroth, and he has a G4 logo where his face should be, and there's an Aerith with a Tech TV logo where her face should be, and it's the scene where Sephiroth is about to kill her.

1943
02:30:22,546 --> 02:30:32,554
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I think the only thing about the stripper kneeing you in the like gonads for the lapdance, I think she noticed that, you know, if you're trying to get lapdances on a discount, she's gonna be a little miffed too, man.

1944
02:30:33,935 --> 02:30:34,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1945
02:30:34,735 --> 02:30:37,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I gotta bend the nuts from the situation.

1946
02:30:38,238 --> 02:30:39,459
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright, it's a three hour show.

1947
02:30:39,479 --> 02:30:40,279
[SPEAKER_23]: Can I move on now?

1948
02:30:42,861 --> 02:30:46,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's a fact that she has a male name.

1949
02:30:46,284 --> 02:30:47,225
[SPEAKER_04]: Her name's Bradley...

1950
02:30:49,485 --> 02:30:54,929
[SPEAKER_23]: DJ Tyrant says, F you to school, not enough time in the day, not having a car license and life going a little too fast for me, I don't want to grow up P.S.

1951
02:30:54,949 --> 02:30:56,891
[SPEAKER_23]: Tell Mel B I said, I heart him

1952
02:31:15,169 --> 02:31:17,571
[SPEAKER_21]: Aw, I heart the tyrants too.

1953
02:31:18,272 --> 02:31:21,594
[SPEAKER_21]: Aw, I know you're trying to suck up to me because you won't pass into E3 next year.

1954
02:31:21,634 --> 02:31:23,316
[SPEAKER_21]: Don't worry, I got you covered like a Jimmy hat.

1955
02:31:23,596 --> 02:31:24,416
[SPEAKER_23]: Fucking fanboys.

1956
02:31:26,918 --> 02:31:27,339
[SPEAKER_23]: Just kidding.

1957
02:31:28,720 --> 02:31:33,383
[SPEAKER_23]: Actually, if Mel can get me into E3 again, I'll be all up on him just like a fanboy.

1958
02:31:34,704 --> 02:31:37,407
[SPEAKER_23]: Not like up on him, but you know.

1959
02:31:38,257 --> 02:31:46,460
[SPEAKER_21]: I know, kind of like when you call me a brother, you know, not the way like we mean in a biological sense, but the way black people talk to each other.

1960
02:31:49,661 --> 02:31:55,723
[SPEAKER_23]: Anyway, DarkLionXVI says, F you to annoying tourists who keep on bugging players just for them to look stupid.

1961
02:31:56,303 --> 02:32:03,486
[SPEAKER_23]: Last night at the Adventure Dome, I had to move a black guy off the Player 2 DER pad because he was distracting a friend of mine while playing The Legend of Max's Extra Stage.

1962
02:32:04,046 --> 02:32:07,707
[SPEAKER_23]: F you to myself for going to a debut party last week, ending up doing nothing at all.

1963
02:32:10,515 --> 02:32:15,680
[SPEAKER_23]: Legend of Zaku says, F you to my little brother for running up almost $30 in overages at the wireless bill this month.

1964
02:32:16,180 --> 02:32:23,567
[SPEAKER_23]: F you to Leisure Time Bowling Alley and Port Authority Bus Terminal in New York City for being assholes by trashing their in the groove for a second extreme machine.

1965
02:32:26,269 --> 02:32:27,730
[SPEAKER_23]: Yay, score one for the good guys.

1966
02:32:27,750 --> 02:32:32,975
[SPEAKER_23]: Dark Tetsuya says, F you to, surprise, surprise, Comcast for taking a giant crap on G4 Tech TV.

1967
02:32:35,728 --> 02:32:41,432
[SPEAKER_23]: DD Arcaholic says, F you to people who think that they're hot guys in video games.

1968
02:32:41,792 --> 02:32:45,114
[SPEAKER_23]: I may not play a lot of video games myself, but I'm pretty sure there are no hot guys in them.

1969
02:32:45,174 --> 02:32:47,676
[SPEAKER_23]: Big ol' sweaty rowdy roadie Piper is not a hot guy.

1970
02:32:48,276 --> 02:32:58,843
[SPEAKER_23]: He does not make me moist with his chest pounding, nor does his ugly Cro-Magnum man head or his butt crack, which is pinched shut due to the vice grip power of his gluteus maxi, make my nipples hard.

1971
02:32:59,464 --> 02:33:01,505
[SPEAKER_23]: Antonio Banderas is a hot, hot guy.

1972
02:33:01,545 --> 02:33:02,746
[SPEAKER_23]: He is not in video games.

1973
02:33:02,826 --> 02:33:03,427
[SPEAKER_23]: No, Montier.

1974
02:33:04,435 --> 02:33:16,424
[SPEAKER_23]: and FU if you think that complaining about the lack of hot guys in the media is a sad pursuit because your continuous excitement of bouncing boobies is itself a sad pursuit.

1975
02:33:16,504 --> 02:33:17,825
[SPEAKER_23]: So there, suck my titty.

1976
02:33:19,486 --> 02:33:19,927
[SPEAKER_15]: Holla.

1977
02:33:21,468 --> 02:33:21,808
[SPEAKER_23]: Wow.

1978
02:33:23,209 --> 02:33:29,294
[SPEAKER_23]: Iguana Girl says, a lovely FU to idiots who think they can talk their way out of warning points for flame baits.

1979
02:33:33,390 --> 02:33:34,230
[SPEAKER_23]: They're coming to get you.

1980
02:33:35,331 --> 02:33:35,751
[SPEAKER_23]: Failed.

1981
02:33:37,872 --> 02:33:43,675
[SPEAKER_23]: Dark Knight has won FU tonight, and that's to torment I'm going to be facing at work here from on out.

1982
02:33:44,116 --> 02:33:47,337
[SPEAKER_23]: Note, I work for a retail store, need I say more.

1983
02:33:48,178 --> 02:33:53,820
[SPEAKER_23]: He works at a retail store, therefore this is not going to be a happy, fun time of year for him.

1984
02:33:54,221 --> 02:33:58,483
[SPEAKER_23]: MPQ says FU to Halo 2 for making it almost impossible to get an Xbox.

1985
02:34:00,635 --> 02:34:05,097
[SPEAKER_23]: and Misty says, fuck me for sleeping until 6 central and having to get to work at 5.

1986
02:34:05,417 --> 02:34:07,597
[SPEAKER_23]: I doubt I'll be getting any sleep tonight.

1987
02:34:09,418 --> 02:34:10,979
[SPEAKER_23]: That's it for our chatroom FUs.

1988
02:34:12,059 --> 02:34:12,559
[SPEAKER_23]: Woo!

1989
02:34:13,219 --> 02:34:13,700
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright.

1990
02:34:14,780 --> 02:34:17,441
[SPEAKER_23]: Very colorful FUs from all you guys.

1991
02:34:17,481 --> 02:34:17,761
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1992
02:34:18,979 --> 02:34:20,540
[SPEAKER_23]: All right, all right.

1993
02:34:20,600 --> 02:34:22,421
[SPEAKER_23]: What we're going to do now is we're going to go to break.

1994
02:34:23,101 --> 02:34:27,263
[SPEAKER_23]: In this break, we're going to hear another brand new long version of an Ultramix 2 song.

1995
02:34:27,703 --> 02:34:30,945
[SPEAKER_23]: I think this time we're going to do a group that's already been announced, actually.

1996
02:34:31,405 --> 02:34:36,668
[SPEAKER_23]: You already kind of knew they were in Ultramix 2 with a song called C Squared because it was on the VRare.

1997
02:34:36,688 --> 02:34:42,130
[SPEAKER_23]: But they have another song in DDR Ultramix as well that was announced on the website, and it's called Mellow.

1998
02:34:42,210 --> 02:34:43,951
[SPEAKER_23]: And the group is Alien No. 613.

1999
02:34:46,354 --> 02:34:46,554
[SPEAKER_23]: and so on.

2000
02:35:08,376 --> 02:35:11,819
[SPEAKER_23]: Miklatov says, F you to Halo 2 for not saving my damn progress.

2001
02:35:12,339 --> 02:35:14,221
[SPEAKER_23]: Now I have to play this fucking level again.

2002
02:35:14,401 --> 02:35:15,342
[SPEAKER_23]: Boo on you, Halo 2.

2003
02:35:16,203 --> 02:35:19,525
[SPEAKER_23]: F you to people who don't realize Drawn Together is one of the hottest shows ever.

2004
02:35:20,186 --> 02:35:25,851
[SPEAKER_23]: It sounds like a horrible idea for a show, and it is, but it's the best thing on Comedy Central since Strangers with Candy.

2005
02:35:25,971 --> 02:35:26,912
[SPEAKER_23]: I love you, Xander.

2006
02:35:39,153 --> 02:35:39,513
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright.

2007
02:35:42,456 --> 02:35:46,160
[SPEAKER_23]: Sorry, Mikotov, I just, your window for some reason didn't show up as red.

2008
02:35:46,580 --> 02:35:49,403
[SPEAKER_23]: It's because you were sending me other messages earlier, that's why.

2009
02:35:49,883 --> 02:35:51,385
[SPEAKER_23]: Anyway, let's get to the break.

2010
02:35:51,625 --> 02:35:56,549
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright, as I promised, Alien number 613 and the song is called Mellow.

2011
02:35:56,870 --> 02:35:57,090
[SPEAKER_23]: Enjoy.

2012
02:39:31,104 --> 02:39:31,524
[SPEAKER_23]: Hello?

2013
02:39:32,325 --> 02:39:33,325
[SPEAKER_23]: Hello, is this thing on?

2014
02:39:33,385 --> 02:39:33,905
[SPEAKER_23]: Testing.

2015
02:39:35,086 --> 02:39:35,966
[SPEAKER_23]: Testing, one, two.

2016
02:39:36,527 --> 02:39:40,488
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm looking in the index, but I don't see anything for how to run a radio show.

2017
02:39:40,589 --> 02:39:41,049
[SPEAKER_23]: Hello?

2018
02:39:41,729 --> 02:39:43,190
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't understand this.

2019
02:39:43,210 --> 02:39:44,530
[SPEAKER_26]: Does this thing work?

2020
02:39:44,570 --> 02:39:46,191
[SPEAKER_26]: This thing reads like stereo instructions.

2021
02:39:46,271 --> 02:39:46,892
[SPEAKER_26]: Is this on?

2022
02:39:46,912 --> 02:39:47,472
[SPEAKER_26]: What the hell?

2023
02:39:50,033 --> 02:39:51,474
[SPEAKER_17]: Orange Lounge Radio.

2024
02:39:51,634 --> 02:39:53,815
[SPEAKER_17]: Broke Down Ghetto Bomani Radio.

2025
02:39:53,895 --> 02:39:54,035
[SPEAKER_17]: What?

2026
02:39:56,178 --> 02:39:56,659
[SPEAKER_23]: Ask Orange Lounge

2027
02:40:13,186 --> 02:40:13,586
[SPEAKER_23]: There you go.

2028
02:40:14,187 --> 02:40:21,095
[SPEAKER_23]: And also, we'll open up the Skype line for you guys if you have anything you want to comment on over the Skype line because I know we haven't gotten to talk to all you guys yet tonight.

2029
02:40:21,575 --> 02:40:26,761
[SPEAKER_23]: Again, if you want more information on the Skype line, visit www.orangelongeradio.com and click on Interact With Us.

2030
02:40:26,841 --> 02:40:27,302
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, Loki?

2031
02:40:28,063 --> 02:40:33,208
[SPEAKER_24]: I would like to take this moment to talk about the wonderful show called Drawn Together.

2032
02:40:34,341 --> 02:40:36,662
[SPEAKER_24]: I watched today the first two episodes twice.

2033
02:40:37,322 --> 02:40:42,563
[SPEAKER_24]: And I have to say, it's the fucking, it is on par, if not better, than The Family Guy.

2034
02:40:42,663 --> 02:40:44,304
[SPEAKER_24]: And that was way up there.

2035
02:40:45,144 --> 02:40:46,144
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, hold on, we're getting a call.

2036
02:40:46,184 --> 02:40:47,624
[SPEAKER_23]: Hi, you're on Orange Lawn Radio.

2037
02:40:50,865 --> 02:40:51,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

2038
02:40:51,425 --> 02:40:53,266
[SPEAKER_23]: Hello.

2039
02:40:53,346 --> 02:40:56,147
[SPEAKER_23]: Turn down the speaker volume in your house.

2040
02:40:56,907 --> 02:40:57,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello?

2041
02:40:57,767 --> 02:40:59,768
[SPEAKER_23]: Hi, we can barely hear you, but we can hear ourselves.

2042
02:40:59,868 --> 02:41:00,688
[SPEAKER_23]: Echoing, turn down your...

2043
02:41:01,761 --> 02:41:06,545
[SPEAKER_23]: I was wondering if you could get Pop Music 5 into rotation I like the music in Pop Music 5 I didn't hear any

2044
02:41:29,602 --> 02:41:39,391
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not sure the exact titles, I think Tempura Brothers, Siciliana, they're Japanese titles, but it's in there somewhere.

2045
02:41:40,051 --> 02:41:40,812
[SPEAKER_23]: You know what I'll do?

2046
02:41:41,032 --> 02:41:48,439
[SPEAKER_23]: I will have our resident poppin' music whore, Navi, take a look at the soundtrack and tell me what I need to add, and we'll put some tracks in rotation, just for you, my friend.

2047
02:41:49,279 --> 02:41:50,541
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks, that's cool.

2048
02:41:50,861 --> 02:41:51,421
[SPEAKER_23]: No problem.

2049
02:41:51,461 --> 02:41:52,522
[SPEAKER_23]: Anything else you want to comment on?

2050
02:41:53,903 --> 02:41:54,404
[SPEAKER_13]: Not really.

2051
02:41:54,464 --> 02:41:56,506
[SPEAKER_23]: Are you liking the Bomani Music and More program otherwise?

2052
02:41:57,170 --> 02:41:58,371
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I like Bomani music.

2053
02:42:19,278 --> 02:42:24,380
[SPEAKER_24]: Shit, if you want to talk about a game that hasn't changed since day one, poppin' music, holy crap!

2054
02:42:25,020 --> 02:42:26,521
[SPEAKER_24]: Why is that game so popular?

2055
02:42:26,541 --> 02:42:27,521
[SPEAKER_24]: That's what I want to know.

2056
02:42:28,101 --> 02:42:29,062
[SPEAKER_15]: Ah, buttons!

2057
02:42:29,462 --> 02:42:30,442
[SPEAKER_15]: I hit the buttons!

2058
02:42:30,742 --> 02:42:31,342
[SPEAKER_15]: Fun!

2059
02:42:31,683 --> 02:42:32,663
[SPEAKER_15]: Japanese music!

2060
02:42:32,723 --> 02:42:33,263
[SPEAKER_15]: Cool!

2061
02:42:33,283 --> 02:42:36,985
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, it's just, no, that game does not appeal to me at all.

2062
02:42:37,065 --> 02:42:40,026
[SPEAKER_24]: It's like 2DX for retards, I mean.

2063
02:42:40,846 --> 02:42:41,886
[SPEAKER_24]: It's just the big buttons.

2064
02:42:41,966 --> 02:42:45,888
[SPEAKER_24]: But, you know, hey, I guess there's a demographic out there for, you know, retarded 2DX players, so...

2065
02:42:46,488 --> 02:42:51,192
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, if you want to play, it's like playing 2DX with boxing gloves, you know, if you want to do that, so be it.

2066
02:42:51,472 --> 02:42:57,757
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, it's cool, it's cool because it gets crazy and stuff, but, you know, they just really haven't changed anything with that game.

2067
02:42:57,797 --> 02:42:58,778
[SPEAKER_24]: They have not changed much.

2068
02:42:59,819 --> 02:43:09,747
[SPEAKER_24]: But here I am, the uninformed pop music person, because I don't play pop music, and I tried playing pop music and it just did not appeal to me, but for some reason I'm still putting pop music in my cabinet, so...

2069
02:43:10,928 --> 02:43:12,289
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm giving another go later.

2070
02:43:13,349 --> 02:43:14,630
[SPEAKER_24]: You take the good, you take the bad.

2071
02:43:14,810 --> 02:43:15,411
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, whatever.

2072
02:43:15,951 --> 02:43:16,251
[SPEAKER_23]: Anyway.

2073
02:43:16,811 --> 02:43:19,493
[SPEAKER_23]: You take them both and there you have the facts alive.

2074
02:43:19,773 --> 02:43:20,873
[SPEAKER_23]: The facts alive.

2075
02:43:21,074 --> 02:43:25,036
[SPEAKER_23]: Whatever happened to that Simphile contest we were going to do like a while back on the show?

2076
02:43:25,616 --> 02:43:32,900
[SPEAKER_23]: Remember we were going to have the Orange Lounge Radio response to Simphile contest and we were going to have the all TV show Simphile theme?

2077
02:43:37,526 --> 02:43:38,066
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, I know.

2078
02:43:38,827 --> 02:43:39,728
[SPEAKER_23]: They can do turn-a-mix.

2079
02:43:39,848 --> 02:43:43,730
[SPEAKER_23]: Shit, I mean, we could give away signed Ikiriyamaoka CDs, for God's sakes.

2080
02:43:43,770 --> 02:43:44,691
[SPEAKER_23]: People would enter for that.

2081
02:43:45,111 --> 02:43:46,552
[SPEAKER_24]: The DVDs in my room.

2082
02:43:46,692 --> 02:43:48,494
[SPEAKER_23]: I know, seriously, we need to have more contests.

2083
02:43:50,295 --> 02:43:54,157
[SPEAKER_21]: I still have like 30 Max 2 viewers at my place if anyone wants them.

2084
02:43:56,199 --> 02:43:58,060
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's just start giving away like candy, hey.

2085
02:43:58,380 --> 02:44:02,423
[SPEAKER_21]: Dude, that's like all we do at like DDR sponsored tournaments.

2086
02:44:03,244 --> 02:44:05,205
[SPEAKER_15]: It's where it's all about speed loud.

2087
02:44:05,885 --> 02:44:06,265
[SPEAKER_23]: There you go.

2088
02:44:07,386 --> 02:44:07,806
[SPEAKER_23]: All right.

2089
02:44:09,327 --> 02:44:10,687
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll be a walking boot.

2090
02:44:12,748 --> 02:44:17,190
[SPEAKER_23]: All right, let's get into a favorite segment here on this program, which we haven't done in quite some time.

2091
02:44:17,410 --> 02:44:18,811
[SPEAKER_23]: Are you sticking with us for a walk?

2092
02:44:19,211 --> 02:44:21,152
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, what the hell, I'll stay here until the end.

2093
02:44:21,312 --> 02:44:23,033
[SPEAKER_23]: All right, that's a real trooper there.

2094
02:44:23,133 --> 02:44:26,354
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, you know, hell, sleep's overrated, I guess.

2095
02:44:26,454 --> 02:44:27,034
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, that's right.

2096
02:44:27,074 --> 02:44:27,815
[SPEAKER_23]: All right, here we go.

2097
02:44:27,835 --> 02:44:29,435
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, that's only 15 more minutes.

2098
02:44:36,192 --> 02:44:39,133
[SPEAKER_23]: Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

2099
02:44:39,633 --> 02:44:42,834
[SPEAKER_23]: What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

2100
02:44:43,254 --> 02:44:52,317
[SPEAKER_23]: Since it's been a few weeks, since we've had a segment, I expect there to be lots of questions or else... Alright.

2101
02:44:56,238 --> 02:44:57,058
[SPEAKER_23]: Here's a real winner.

2102
02:44:57,258 --> 02:44:59,199
[SPEAKER_23]: This question's from Legend of Zaku.

2103
02:45:01,024 --> 02:45:01,845
[SPEAKER_23]: I love this question.

2104
02:45:01,865 --> 02:45:05,007
[SPEAKER_23]: This is why I miss the Ask Orange Lounge segment.

2105
02:45:05,647 --> 02:45:11,310
[SPEAKER_23]: Because remember, you can ask us about Bomani, you can ask us about whatever the hell you want, and this definitely falls into the latter.

2106
02:45:12,791 --> 02:45:21,677
[SPEAKER_23]: Legend of Zaku says, Being a person of Hispanic descent, how come white girls like and have a thing for Hispanic guys?

2107
02:45:23,612 --> 02:45:26,413
[SPEAKER_23]: Dude, ask Eddie Guerrero from the WWE.

2108
02:45:26,474 --> 02:45:29,015
[SPEAKER_15]: It's all about Latino Heat!

2109
02:45:29,215 --> 02:45:32,116
[SPEAKER_23]: Jamie just burst into the room from where she was.

2110
02:45:32,136 --> 02:45:33,457
[SPEAKER_24]: This is all of us do.

2111
02:45:34,097 --> 02:45:39,660
[SPEAKER_24]: Hey man, you want to see my Aztec Warrior?

2112
02:45:39,680 --> 02:45:41,141
[SPEAKER_24]: Gotta love next Friday.

2113
02:45:50,071 --> 02:45:53,233
[SPEAKER_26]: That has to be one of the most retarded questions I've ever heard in my life.

2114
02:45:53,253 --> 02:45:55,675
[SPEAKER_26]: That is so generalized.

2115
02:45:56,896 --> 02:46:08,304
[SPEAKER_26]: I personally... Maybe in his neck of the woods, but... In general, I'm sorry, no offense, I mean, I've dated a few Hispanic guys, but most in general, I've not had very good experiences with.

2116
02:46:11,212 --> 02:46:12,755
[SPEAKER_26]: I have a lot of friends.

2117
02:46:13,496 --> 02:46:20,089
[SPEAKER_26]: I've dated a few guys, but in general, I haven't had a very good experience in a romantic relationship with Hispanic men.

2118
02:46:21,335 --> 02:46:22,836
[SPEAKER_23]: I dated a Hispanic guy once.

2119
02:46:23,456 --> 02:46:24,397
[SPEAKER_23]: It was a nice date.

2120
02:46:24,437 --> 02:46:26,778
[SPEAKER_23]: Son of a bitch never called me back, but it was a nice date.

2121
02:46:28,039 --> 02:46:39,165
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think probably the fact that I have a Hispanic last name, you know, I too wonder why all the white chicks dig me too.

2122
02:46:39,525 --> 02:46:42,646
[SPEAKER_24]: I can't answer this question without sounding like a racist.

2123
02:46:43,467 --> 02:46:45,108
[SPEAKER_24]: Let's move on to the second question then.

2124
02:46:48,138 --> 02:46:49,519
[SPEAKER_23]: Um, let's see, Jazz.

2125
02:46:50,020 --> 02:46:51,021
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, this is a good question.

2126
02:46:51,081 --> 02:46:53,103
[SPEAKER_23]: Have any of you guys played Technic Beat?

2127
02:46:53,543 --> 02:46:54,765
[SPEAKER_23]: And if so, what do you think of it?

2128
02:46:54,805 --> 02:47:03,934
[SPEAKER_23]: This is a brand new game that came out from, I believe, Namco did it, and it's another one of their bargain basement games, like Katamari Damashii, and I've heard a lot of great things about it, but I've been too ghetto poor to pay it.

2129
02:47:04,115 --> 02:47:05,716
[SPEAKER_23]: I've seen pictures...

2130
02:47:06,577 --> 02:47:07,598
[SPEAKER_24]: But I haven't played it.

2131
02:47:07,879 --> 02:47:10,541
[SPEAKER_24]: I've seen pictures, it looks interesting, but I haven't played it.

2132
02:47:10,762 --> 02:47:12,503
[SPEAKER_23]: I've heard very, very good things about it.

2133
02:47:12,524 --> 02:47:14,546
[SPEAKER_24]: Isn't it something about like Ripples or something?

2134
02:47:14,566 --> 02:47:19,050
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, it's on my to-do list because it is, you know, we want to cover all the popular music.

2135
02:47:19,070 --> 02:47:21,473
[SPEAKER_23]: We still need to get the game where you do the alien that annoys people.

2136
02:47:21,593 --> 02:47:25,337
[SPEAKER_23]: I know, the Under the Skin.

2137
02:47:25,597 --> 02:47:26,178
[SPEAKER_23]: Under the Skin.

2138
02:47:26,198 --> 02:47:27,579
[SPEAKER_23]: But that has nothing to do with Technic Beat.

2139
02:47:27,840 --> 02:47:28,060
[SPEAKER_23]: I know.

2140
02:47:28,080 --> 02:47:29,001
[SPEAKER_23]: Quick change in the subject, Tommy.

2141
02:47:30,737 --> 02:47:33,218
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright, but yeah, Technic Beat, I'm looking forward to it.

2142
02:47:33,258 --> 02:47:34,358
[SPEAKER_23]: I've heard a lot of great things about it.

2143
02:47:34,398 --> 02:47:36,299
[SPEAKER_23]: Unfortunately, I have not had a chance to play it yet.

2144
02:47:36,359 --> 02:47:39,660
[SPEAKER_23]: I haven't seen it anywhere, strangely enough.

2145
02:47:39,720 --> 02:47:41,701
[SPEAKER_23]: I didn't even realize it was out until I went onto a website.

2146
02:47:41,721 --> 02:47:43,782
[SPEAKER_24]: I was looking for Under the Skin the last time I was at the mall.

2147
02:47:44,642 --> 02:47:44,982
[SPEAKER_23]: Nothing.

2148
02:47:46,103 --> 02:47:46,383
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright.

2149
02:47:48,157 --> 02:47:48,637
[SPEAKER_23]: Technic Beat.

2150
02:47:48,938 --> 02:47:50,459
[SPEAKER_23]: We will check it out as soon as we can.

2151
02:47:50,679 --> 02:47:52,840
[SPEAKER_24]: Don't we still need to get Karaoke Revolution 3?

2152
02:47:53,080 --> 02:47:53,621
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, we do.

2153
02:47:53,661 --> 02:47:56,463
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you for reminding me.

2154
02:47:56,623 --> 02:48:02,026
[SPEAKER_23]: I want to invite Iguana Girl back on the show so we can do our duet to Love Shack live on air on Karaoke Revolution 3.

2155
02:48:02,127 --> 02:48:03,988
[SPEAKER_23]: I hope she'll be down for it.

2156
02:48:05,249 --> 02:48:06,790
[SPEAKER_23]: And then we're going to make you sing.

2157
02:48:07,370 --> 02:48:08,751
[SPEAKER_24]: So very ronery.

2158
02:48:11,233 --> 02:48:11,573
[SPEAKER_23]: All right.

2159
02:48:14,219 --> 02:48:19,002
[SPEAKER_23]: DD Archaholic says, when you guys are not playing Bomani games, what other toys do you like?

2160
02:48:21,304 --> 02:48:25,427
[SPEAKER_23]: Mine come from a store called Goldies, which is located on 16th, never mind, I'm kidding.

2161
02:48:26,787 --> 02:48:31,571
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know, I don't have any toys in the living room that might be playing video or anything like that.

2162
02:48:33,192 --> 02:48:34,092
[SPEAKER_26]: I have my computer.

2163
02:48:35,313 --> 02:48:38,875
[SPEAKER_24]: I have my computer, my turntables, my cabinet, my game systems.

2164
02:48:41,497 --> 02:48:42,778
[SPEAKER_24]: My portal to hell device.

2165
02:48:43,280 --> 02:48:45,526
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't need toys, I have a man I can climb all over.

2166
02:48:50,154 --> 02:48:52,514
[SPEAKER_24]: That has been a journey into the TMI zone.

2167
02:48:53,135 --> 02:48:53,995
[SPEAKER_23]: What about you, FlowWalk?

2168
02:48:54,015 --> 02:48:56,195
[SPEAKER_23]: What do you do when you're not playing Mamani?

2169
02:48:56,975 --> 02:48:58,756
[SPEAKER_21]: Besides recovering from eye strain afterwards.

2170
02:48:59,156 --> 02:49:00,116
[SPEAKER_23]: What other toys?

2171
02:49:00,596 --> 02:49:01,616
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, gosh.

2172
02:49:02,416 --> 02:49:02,996
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's see.

2173
02:49:03,196 --> 02:49:10,438
[SPEAKER_21]: I got my... I play with poker chips all the time because obviously I play a bunch of Hold'em on the side and stuff like that.

2174
02:49:11,098 --> 02:49:13,798
[SPEAKER_21]: I got my car, which is, you know, still my toy.

2175
02:49:13,858 --> 02:49:14,938
[SPEAKER_21]: I still think of it that way.

2176
02:49:15,038 --> 02:49:16,599
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, you would too if you won it.

2177
02:49:17,639 --> 02:49:17,779
[SPEAKER_21]: And...

2178
02:49:18,863 --> 02:49:19,724
[SPEAKER_21]: and, of course, Yu-Gi-Oh!

2179
02:49:19,764 --> 02:49:22,226
[SPEAKER_21]: cards, which I toss around nowadays.

2180
02:49:23,007 --> 02:49:24,048
[SPEAKER_21]: That's really about it.

2181
02:49:24,188 --> 02:49:26,290
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm kind of outgoing to toy things.

2182
02:49:26,511 --> 02:49:28,192
[SPEAKER_21]: Except I still play with bobbleheads.

2183
02:49:28,212 --> 02:49:30,915
[SPEAKER_23]: Do you miss Kyle Snyder as a worthy opponent at Yu-Gi-Oh?

2184
02:49:31,303 --> 02:49:54,163
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh my god totally where else would you get like a totally great duel along with color commentary on the side I mean it's like straight up walking to like the cartoon and it is it's you are not playing Yu-Gi-Oh you are like you're in the mini production of a movie it's like you can make a music video out of just us two going at it it is so awesome I would have loved to have seen a Yu-Gi-Oh Tatooine video

2185
02:49:56,845 --> 02:49:58,446
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't have anything, I already talked about my toys

2186
02:50:21,752 --> 02:50:23,173
[SPEAKER_23]: All right.

2187
02:50:23,213 --> 02:50:25,835
[SPEAKER_23]: We have another question for Ask Orange Lounge from Chance.

2188
02:50:26,095 --> 02:50:30,638
[SPEAKER_23]: And Chance is asking, when are you going to update the chat server info on the website?

2189
02:50:30,758 --> 02:50:31,138
[SPEAKER_23]: Zing!

2190
02:50:31,578 --> 02:50:32,479
[SPEAKER_23]: I didn't know it was wrong.

2191
02:50:32,819 --> 02:50:33,920
[SPEAKER_23]: I actually did not know it was wrong.

2192
02:50:34,700 --> 02:50:35,521
[SPEAKER_23]: I will look into that.

2193
02:50:35,561 --> 02:50:36,941
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you for bringing that to my attention.

2194
02:50:37,642 --> 02:50:37,962
[SPEAKER_01]: Yikes!

2195
02:50:39,223 --> 02:50:40,143
[SPEAKER_23]: I thought it worked just fine.

2196
02:50:40,183 --> 02:50:41,544
[SPEAKER_23]: I've still been using the Java chat.

2197
02:50:41,804 --> 02:50:42,585
[SPEAKER_23]: Maybe you know what it is.

2198
02:50:42,805 --> 02:50:45,847
[SPEAKER_23]: I think it's because one of the other side IRC things went down.

2199
02:50:46,507 --> 02:50:47,308
[SPEAKER_23]: I will look into that.

2200
02:50:49,062 --> 02:50:49,502
[SPEAKER_23]: My bad.

2201
02:50:51,643 --> 02:50:58,364
[SPEAKER_23]: And Jazz, okay, his second question to us is, why are boobs?

2202
02:51:03,706 --> 02:51:04,486
[SPEAKER_23]: That's the question.

2203
02:51:04,546 --> 02:51:05,346
[SPEAKER_23]: Why are boobs?

2204
02:51:05,546 --> 02:51:06,966
[SPEAKER_23]: Spelled B-E-W-B-S.

2205
02:51:07,046 --> 02:51:07,387
[SPEAKER_23]: Boobs.

2206
02:51:08,267 --> 02:51:08,707
[SPEAKER_23]: Boobs.

2207
02:51:09,547 --> 02:51:09,967
[SPEAKER_23]: Boobs.

2208
02:51:10,787 --> 02:51:11,688
[SPEAKER_23]: Why are boobs?

2209
02:51:13,568 --> 02:51:14,168
[SPEAKER_23]: Why not?

2210
02:51:16,489 --> 02:51:16,829
[SPEAKER_15]: Lovely.

2211
02:51:20,114 --> 02:51:22,376
[SPEAKER_24]: Because if milk came out their ass, that'd be weird.

2212
02:51:22,396 --> 02:51:28,560
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, they're what make the world go around.

2213
02:51:28,860 --> 02:51:29,680
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, think about it.

2214
02:51:29,700 --> 02:51:31,542
[SPEAKER_21]: When you were a kid and you were crying, what did mom do?

2215
02:51:31,882 --> 02:51:33,223
[SPEAKER_21]: She shoved one of them in your mouth.

2216
02:51:33,883 --> 02:51:38,006
[SPEAKER_21]: Women out there, just understand, if you ever want to make us shut up, shove one in our mouth, man.

2217
02:51:40,608 --> 02:51:42,089
[SPEAKER_21]: Wow, okay.

2218
02:51:44,410 --> 02:51:44,650
[SPEAKER_01]: Women.

2219
02:51:44,690 --> 02:51:44,890
[SPEAKER_01]: Boo.

2220
02:51:45,010 --> 02:51:45,551
[SPEAKER_01]: What, Jamie?

2221
02:51:52,119 --> 02:52:00,791
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know how far I want to go with this question because I don't know if I want to bring up politics on this program.

2222
02:52:00,811 --> 02:52:04,215
[SPEAKER_23]: If you want to argue politics, go to random chat on DDR Freak.

2223
02:52:04,235 --> 02:52:05,477
[SPEAKER_23]: There's tons of politics threads there.

2224
02:52:07,287 --> 02:52:09,348
[SPEAKER_23]: Who did you vote for on election day?

2225
02:52:12,049 --> 02:52:14,070
[SPEAKER_23]: Honestly, if you listen to the show enough, you know.

2226
02:52:14,250 --> 02:52:16,131
[SPEAKER_23]: You know that Jamie voted for Bill the Cat.

2227
02:52:16,191 --> 02:52:17,992
[SPEAKER_23]: You know that I voted for Carrie.

2228
02:52:18,712 --> 02:52:21,553
[SPEAKER_26]: All the candidates were pieces of flaming shit.

2229
02:52:22,094 --> 02:52:23,194
[SPEAKER_26]: And not flaming in a good way.

2230
02:52:23,214 --> 02:52:26,316
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean flaming as in on fire so they're extra stinky.

2231
02:52:27,316 --> 02:52:37,324
[SPEAKER_24]: So, you know, if I voted, it would probably have been like I would have voted for Kerry, but the election machine would have seen that I was actually intoxicated or out of my mind and would have voted Bush for me, so...

2232
02:52:38,072 --> 02:52:40,473
[SPEAKER_23]: Now, let me take a poll here.

2233
02:52:40,573 --> 02:52:42,153
[SPEAKER_23]: Who did vote on election day?

2234
02:52:42,313 --> 02:52:43,774
[SPEAKER_23]: No matter who you voted for, you did vote.

2235
02:52:43,794 --> 02:52:44,774
[SPEAKER_23]: I didn't!

2236
02:52:44,794 --> 02:52:46,415
[SPEAKER_23]: Looks like me and TripleExplicit did.

2237
02:52:46,555 --> 02:52:50,236
[SPEAKER_23]: Everybody here but Loki went and voted on election day, so that's something.

2238
02:52:50,296 --> 02:52:54,497
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, usually on a typical election year, there wouldn't be this many people voting.

2239
02:52:54,737 --> 02:52:57,118
[SPEAKER_23]: So, I think that says enough right there.

2240
02:52:57,158 --> 02:52:58,559
[SPEAKER_23]: At least, you know, everybody voted.

2241
02:52:58,619 --> 02:53:01,319
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, you know, a lot more people than usual voted, which is good.

2242
02:53:01,339 --> 02:53:03,060
[SPEAKER_21]: And my take on voting has always been...

2243
02:53:03,769 --> 02:53:07,192
[SPEAKER_21]: If you're gonna, like, complain about stuff, at least be proactive one way or another.

2244
02:53:07,212 --> 02:53:08,152
[SPEAKER_21]: It doesn't matter how you vote.

2245
02:53:08,192 --> 02:53:10,594
[SPEAKER_21]: As long as you do it, hey, you know, you have a say.

2246
02:53:10,914 --> 02:53:15,437
[SPEAKER_21]: That's why sometimes people say, oh, yeah, man, I hate what's going on, all this kind of stuff, but I'm not gonna vote.

2247
02:53:15,678 --> 02:53:17,399
[SPEAKER_21]: But how the fuck are you gonna, you know, change things?

2248
02:53:18,099 --> 02:53:19,841
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, I mean, I don't care how you vote.

2249
02:53:19,881 --> 02:53:21,742
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, not everyone's gonna see eye to eye.

2250
02:53:21,802 --> 02:53:26,966
[SPEAKER_21]: If you think the government should always be one certain party or the other, I mean, you're no different than Osama.

2251
02:53:27,006 --> 02:53:29,968
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, if you think the government should be run one way only, then...

2252
02:53:30,410 --> 02:53:32,151
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, you know, that's not a cool thing.

2253
02:53:32,251 --> 02:53:35,633
[SPEAKER_21]: I think, yeah, you gotta mix it up once in a while, and that's why we have different parties.

2254
02:53:35,713 --> 02:53:39,155
[SPEAKER_21]: And for those, I mean, I know Jamie goes off about, like, there's more than two parties.

2255
02:53:39,635 --> 02:53:45,018
[SPEAKER_21]: I think what people aren't getting is, it's like, you can't make change from the top down.

2256
02:53:45,058 --> 02:53:46,339
[SPEAKER_21]: You kinda gotta start from the bottom up.

2257
02:53:46,399 --> 02:53:52,182
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, if an independent party can't, like, win, like, a senator job sometimes, I mean, how the hell is it gonna be president?

2258
02:53:52,763 --> 02:53:53,563
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, it's just...

2259
02:53:54,364 --> 02:54:01,168
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't say it can't happen or shouldn't happen, but I think they've just got to aim a little smaller first before they, you know, go for the big prize.

2260
02:54:01,608 --> 02:54:07,552
[SPEAKER_26]: I still am for disabling the electoral college and getting rid of the party system altogether.

2261
02:54:08,272 --> 02:54:13,595
[SPEAKER_23]: I am all for, and you might hear me complain about this later, I am all for disabling electronic voting.

2262
02:54:14,155 --> 02:54:16,016
[SPEAKER_23]: Paperless voting is very bad.

2263
02:54:16,036 --> 02:54:16,937
[SPEAKER_23]: Everyone votes on paper.

2264
02:54:16,997 --> 02:54:18,838
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, I totally agree with that.

2265
02:54:20,290 --> 02:54:22,013
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, it's Ask Orange Lounge.

2266
02:54:22,033 --> 02:54:30,105
[SPEAKER_26]: We got on elect... Electronic voting offers more of a chance that the vote is either not going to be counted, altered.

2267
02:54:30,125 --> 02:54:32,609
[SPEAKER_26]: It has a lot more inconsistency.

2268
02:54:32,930 --> 02:54:35,374
[SPEAKER_26]: That's why voting... I did a write-in absentee.

2269
02:54:37,037 --> 02:54:44,745
[SPEAKER_25]: Even though at the polls they had the floating and hanging Chad problem this year just like they did back last election, so why?

2270
02:54:44,865 --> 02:54:49,349
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, I think the way they need to do it is, honestly, I love the way they do it in Sacramento County.

2271
02:54:49,610 --> 02:54:51,812
[SPEAKER_23]: You have a mix of electronic and paper.

2272
02:54:51,872 --> 02:54:57,778
[SPEAKER_23]: You fill in the bubble and then you scan it, and that way you scan it, and if there's a dispute with the way they're scanned, you have a paper trail.

2273
02:54:58,178 --> 02:54:59,840
[SPEAKER_23]: I think it's the perfect way to do it, personally.

2274
02:54:59,860 --> 02:55:00,060
[SPEAKER_23]: Absolutely.

2275
02:55:00,467 --> 02:55:02,909
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, okay, I thought you meant, like, okay, never mind.

2276
02:55:04,110 --> 02:55:08,654
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, I'm totally fine with Scantron voting, I just do not like electronic voting with no paper trail.

2277
02:55:08,814 --> 02:55:12,657
[SPEAKER_24]: And for all those kids out there, you know what's really fun to do, a Scantron test?

2278
02:55:13,157 --> 02:55:18,922
[SPEAKER_24]: There's this little bubble in the top of the test marquee, and if you scan that in, guess what?

2279
02:55:19,242 --> 02:55:20,223
[SPEAKER_24]: You're the answers!

2280
02:55:22,123 --> 02:55:24,785
[SPEAKER_24]: It really fucks up all the tests.

2281
02:55:24,905 --> 02:55:30,049
[SPEAKER_23]: Anyway, off the politics subject, I want to wrap up the last few questions here so we can close this segment.

2282
02:55:33,331 --> 02:55:34,832
[SPEAKER_23]: Dark Knight has a weird one here.

2283
02:55:35,513 --> 02:55:37,514
[SPEAKER_23]: This might be a sad question, but this is all I have.

2284
02:55:37,614 --> 02:55:41,797
[SPEAKER_23]: Which trading card game slash cartoon crossover is the worst?

2285
02:55:42,776 --> 02:55:44,117
[SPEAKER_23]: That's if you've seen any of them.

2286
02:55:44,157 --> 02:55:45,137
[SPEAKER_23]: If you don't want to answer, don't.

2287
02:55:45,717 --> 02:55:46,738
[SPEAKER_24]: All of them.

2288
02:55:47,518 --> 02:55:48,839
[SPEAKER_24]: All of them suck.

2289
02:55:49,519 --> 02:55:50,480
[SPEAKER_24]: All of them, says Loki.

2290
02:55:50,700 --> 02:55:51,740
[SPEAKER_21]: All of them suck.

2291
02:55:52,420 --> 02:55:52,921
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know.

2292
02:55:53,001 --> 02:55:53,861
[SPEAKER_21]: Kind of hard to say.

2293
02:55:53,901 --> 02:56:02,405
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, everyone, I mean, I'm personally not even that big a fan of Pokemon, really, but I think it's funny because, no, I mean, it's kind of cool, but, I mean, if I had to pick one, but...

2294
02:56:02,805 --> 02:56:22,856
[SPEAKER_21]: Funny thing, because I think of, like, cartoons and crossovers into TCGs, I heard a rumor from, like, Upper Deck, who does, like, the Marvel Versus series, like, soon they're supposed to be releasing one with, like, the Justice League, so you could have, like, Superman, Batman, the Wonder Twins and all that stuff, versus, like, Brainiac, Mitzelplick and all that, I mean, would that not be just the coolest idea ever?

2295
02:56:22,896 --> 02:56:24,237
[SPEAKER_24]: That would be a cool video game.

2296
02:56:24,357 --> 02:56:25,177
[SPEAKER_24]: Card game, no.

2297
02:56:26,098 --> 02:56:26,198
[SPEAKER_21]: Eh.

2298
02:56:28,099 --> 02:56:28,859
[SPEAKER_21]: Of course, man.

2299
02:56:29,059 --> 02:56:30,700
[SPEAKER_21]: And Aquaman ain't gonna drown in no tub.

2300
02:56:32,919 --> 02:56:33,580
[SPEAKER_23]: All right, all right.

2301
02:56:33,680 --> 02:56:34,080
[SPEAKER_23]: One more.

2302
02:56:34,120 --> 02:56:35,361
[SPEAKER_23]: Duel Masters is pretty ass.

2303
02:56:35,701 --> 02:56:37,283
[SPEAKER_23]: One more question here, then we've got to wrap it up.

2304
02:56:37,323 --> 02:56:39,524
[SPEAKER_23]: Last question from... Duel Masters suck.

2305
02:56:41,886 --> 02:56:43,848
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, last question from DarkTetsuya.

2306
02:56:44,368 --> 02:56:47,851
[SPEAKER_23]: He sent me a song to put in Cage Match this week, and he says, you didn't use my song.

2307
02:56:47,931 --> 02:56:49,612
[SPEAKER_23]: Is it because I put it in the wrong format?

2308
02:56:49,973 --> 02:56:51,934
[SPEAKER_23]: No, it's just because I really wanted to put that other song in.

2309
02:56:52,334 --> 02:56:53,475
[SPEAKER_23]: Your song is in my queue.

2310
02:56:53,595 --> 02:56:54,396
[SPEAKER_23]: It'll come up eventually.

2311
02:56:54,416 --> 02:56:54,756
[SPEAKER_23]: Don't worry.

2312
02:56:55,177 --> 02:56:55,297
[SPEAKER_23]: So...

2313
02:56:56,129 --> 02:56:56,629
[SPEAKER_23]: No worries.

2314
02:56:57,369 --> 02:57:02,211
[SPEAKER_23]: If you have suggestions, you can always send us an email, one of the hosts an email, and we'll get your song and cage match if we like it.

2315
02:57:02,491 --> 02:57:04,452
[SPEAKER_23]: And I do like his picks, so I'll get in there eventually.

2316
02:57:04,472 --> 02:57:06,633
[SPEAKER_24]: Nobody except Spammer sends me an email.

2317
02:57:07,813 --> 02:57:08,213
[SPEAKER_23]: All right.

2318
02:57:08,594 --> 02:57:09,854
[SPEAKER_23]: We've got to wrap up the show, guys.

2319
02:57:09,914 --> 02:57:11,235
[SPEAKER_23]: It's about time for the show to end.

2320
02:57:11,595 --> 02:57:13,375
[SPEAKER_23]: Sad, cry, sniff, sniff.

2321
02:57:14,796 --> 02:57:16,496
[SPEAKER_26]: How was my leg?

2322
02:57:16,657 --> 02:57:21,318
[SPEAKER_23]: We're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts, starting with LankyStyle, who's been absent for the past hour.

2323
02:57:21,758 --> 02:57:23,139
[SPEAKER_23]: He's been on my cell phone, ringing up my bill.

2324
02:57:24,379 --> 02:57:25,420
[SPEAKER_25]: Use that as a name.

2325
02:57:25,440 --> 02:57:26,080
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, it is fine.

2326
02:57:26,101 --> 02:57:27,021
[SPEAKER_23]: That's a nice idea.

2327
02:57:27,562 --> 02:57:28,042
[SPEAKER_23]: Please do.

2328
02:57:29,483 --> 02:57:31,184
[SPEAKER_25]: Are we getting my final thought?

2329
02:57:31,204 --> 02:57:31,844
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, your final thought.

2330
02:57:31,985 --> 02:57:33,045
[SPEAKER_25]: It's all Greek to me.

2331
02:57:34,246 --> 02:57:35,527
[SPEAKER_23]: BroWalk, your final thought.

2332
02:57:35,587 --> 02:57:37,528
[SPEAKER_23]: Thanks for being here again, by the way, bud.

2333
02:57:37,728 --> 02:57:38,289
[SPEAKER_21]: Not a problem.

2334
02:57:39,990 --> 02:57:47,195
[SPEAKER_21]: I just want to say, go out there, support Ultramix 2, and support Orange Lounge, support all of B-Money, because, hey, man,

2335
02:57:48,342 --> 02:57:53,604
[SPEAKER_21]: You guys are like our Wonderbra, you are the wind beneath our wings, you are all that and a bucket of wings and etc.

2336
02:57:53,644 --> 02:57:53,984
[SPEAKER_21]: etc.

2337
02:57:54,024 --> 02:57:54,945
[SPEAKER_21]: and I shall cut myself off.

2338
02:57:55,605 --> 02:57:57,726
[SPEAKER_21]: Coca-Cola, Wonderbra.

2339
02:58:00,267 --> 02:58:01,507
[SPEAKER_23]: Explicit, your final thought.

2340
02:58:02,047 --> 02:58:04,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Time to purchase WWX, Rumble Roses.

2341
02:58:04,868 --> 02:58:05,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2342
02:58:05,569 --> 02:58:07,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.

2343
02:58:07,729 --> 02:58:08,750
[SPEAKER_23]: Loki, your final thought.

2344
02:58:10,230 --> 02:58:12,291
[SPEAKER_24]: My headache's gone, that makes me happy.

2345
02:58:15,012 --> 02:58:16,193
[SPEAKER_23]: My final thought is...

2346
02:58:18,624 --> 02:58:18,904
[SPEAKER_23]: Hi.

2347
02:58:20,085 --> 02:58:20,425
[SPEAKER_23]: That's it.

2348
02:58:20,725 --> 02:58:21,466
[SPEAKER_23]: I have nothing else to say.

2349
02:58:22,386 --> 02:58:23,267
[SPEAKER_23]: Jamie, your final thoughts?

2350
02:58:24,167 --> 02:58:26,768
[SPEAKER_26]: I have to drive home in a freaking Benadryl coma.

2351
02:58:28,289 --> 02:58:29,270
[SPEAKER_26]: Damnation.

2352
02:58:29,850 --> 02:58:32,011
[SPEAKER_21]: I have to drive through the boring part of Haiti to get home.

2353
02:58:34,993 --> 02:58:36,113
[SPEAKER_21]: And Mel has love for Didi.

2354
02:58:36,153 --> 02:58:37,234
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, freak, I hear you, Jess.

2355
02:58:37,254 --> 02:58:39,355
[SPEAKER_21]: Don't worry, it wasn't intentional.

2356
02:58:39,835 --> 02:58:40,155
[SPEAKER_21]: Jeez.

2357
02:58:40,956 --> 02:58:42,337
[SPEAKER_21]: And I have to drive with a broken car.

2358
02:58:44,006 --> 02:58:45,888
[SPEAKER_23]: We've given DDR Freak tons of plugs tonight.

2359
02:58:46,228 --> 02:58:48,190
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, of course, the whole syndication thing helps.

2360
02:58:48,490 --> 02:58:50,032
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, it's cool.

2361
02:58:50,092 --> 02:58:51,853
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, it's pretty dope.

2362
02:58:51,873 --> 02:58:55,196
[SPEAKER_23]: We're starting to come together as one big Bimani bunch.

2363
02:58:55,316 --> 02:58:55,657
[SPEAKER_23]: It's great.

2364
02:58:55,677 --> 02:58:56,918
[SPEAKER_21]: Fucking Katamari, that's what it is.

2365
02:58:58,195 --> 02:59:04,519
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, you know what, this DDR thing is going to die soon anyway, so we better all be prepared to be Katamari Damacy Radio and Katamari Damacy Freak.

2366
02:59:04,540 --> 02:59:06,401
[SPEAKER_21]: No, we're all getting Katamari together, man.

2367
02:59:07,061 --> 02:59:11,265
[SPEAKER_21]: You see, we built it up big enough to take DDR Freak, which is like the biggest of all of us.

2368
02:59:11,725 --> 02:59:15,528
[SPEAKER_21]: You started with Orange Lounge, then you rolled up DDR, and now you're going to roll them up.

2369
02:59:15,548 --> 02:59:16,549
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, seriously, seriously.

2370
02:59:16,909 --> 02:59:23,314
[SPEAKER_23]: Orange Lounge has to roll up like all the other little Bumani sites before it can really take on Freak, okay?

2371
02:59:24,495 --> 02:59:25,356
[SPEAKER_23]: No, I'm kidding.

2372
02:59:25,596 --> 02:59:31,859
[SPEAKER_26]: To answer in the chat room, as I am feeling very, very ill right now, I may or may not be online when I get home.

2373
02:59:32,100 --> 02:59:34,021
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm probably going to go right to bed, but we'll see.

2374
02:59:34,481 --> 02:59:45,307
[SPEAKER_24]: It's all about Orange Lounge Town in the brand new, coming to the DS, Animal Crossing.

2375
02:59:45,827 --> 02:59:46,508
[SPEAKER_24]: Bingo!

2376
02:59:46,528 --> 02:59:50,130
[SPEAKER_26]: That's right, our free DS is going to be at my house soon.

2377
02:59:51,334 --> 02:59:52,856
[SPEAKER_23]: I want a free DS, what the hell?

2378
02:59:53,277 --> 02:59:54,759
[SPEAKER_23]: What is with you people and your hookups?

2379
02:59:54,779 --> 03:00:04,254
[SPEAKER_25]: You're a free DS, you're a free Konami I'll feel good to have known that I earned my DS Out of two days of hard work

2380
03:00:05,458 --> 03:00:07,319
[SPEAKER_23]: Way to put down everybody else, LankyStyle.

2381
03:00:07,559 --> 03:00:11,740
[SPEAKER_26]: I think Dan earned his by having managed a GameStop for us on this one.

2382
03:00:12,620 --> 03:00:13,221
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright, alright.

2383
03:00:13,621 --> 03:00:14,741
[SPEAKER_23]: Final word of the show.

2384
03:00:15,481 --> 03:00:18,603
[SPEAKER_23]: LankyStyle, I'm going to give you tonight's final word, Mr. LankyStyle.

2385
03:00:18,703 --> 03:00:19,703
[SPEAKER_23]: One word to sum it all up.

2386
03:00:20,043 --> 03:00:20,923
[SPEAKER_23]: One word to sum it all up.

2387
03:00:21,303 --> 03:00:22,344
[SPEAKER_23]: MGS3, biatch!

2388
03:00:24,345 --> 03:00:29,226
[SPEAKER_16]: That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

2389
03:00:30,026 --> 03:00:34,188
[SPEAKER_16]: Orange Lounge Radio Live is an Orange Lounge Radio production.

2391
03:00:48,326 --> 03:00:57,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's the holiday season and Santa is checking his list to see who is naughty or nice and I'm kind of feeling guilty, so I wrote a song.

2392
03:01:00,963 --> 03:01:21,456
[SPEAKER_06]: So many presents, so little time Santa won't be coming by my house this year Cause I tried to drown my sister and I pierced my ear

2393
03:01:23,221 --> 03:01:34,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Mama made it perfectly clear Santa don't like bad boys Especially Jewish ones!

2394
03:01:36,499 --> 03:01:46,785
[SPEAKER_06]: Gnip Gnop and Lego blocks are what I desire So why'd I have to set the pizza guy's hair on fire?

2395
03:01:47,805 --> 03:01:53,848
[SPEAKER_06]: I told him I was sorry, I'm a liar So no toys for me

2396
03:01:57,104 --> 03:01:58,645
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't deserve them.

2397
03:01:59,025 --> 03:02:03,568
[SPEAKER_06]: I couldn't wait for a big wheel as the holiday neared.

2398
03:02:03,588 --> 03:02:08,031
[SPEAKER_06]: But then I told my grandma that she had a beard.

2399
03:02:09,311 --> 03:02:13,454
[SPEAKER_06]: Dear Santa, I know what my problem is.

2400
03:02:14,715 --> 03:02:15,696
[SPEAKER_06]: Why I can't be good.

2401
03:02:16,556 --> 03:02:17,717
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a fear of intimacy.

2402
03:02:18,958 --> 03:02:22,300
[SPEAKER_06]: You see, my whole life, whenever I've met someone really great like you and

2403
03:02:22,984 --> 03:02:25,305
[SPEAKER_06]: I keep feeling I'm getting too close to them.

2404
03:02:25,385 --> 03:02:27,625
[SPEAKER_06]: Something inside me makes me want to screw it up.

2405
03:02:28,265 --> 03:02:33,747
[SPEAKER_06]: So in a weird way, the reason I'm so bad is because I love you so much, Santa.

2406
03:02:34,967 --> 03:02:39,028
[SPEAKER_06]: Rock'em, sock'em, robot is what I was hoping for.

2407
03:02:39,848 --> 03:02:44,169
[SPEAKER_06]: But then I made a death threat to Vice President Gore.

2408
03:02:44,930 --> 03:02:50,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Santa won't be knocking on my door, cause he's a big, fat whore.

2409
03:02:53,024 --> 03:02:59,228
[SPEAKER_06]: What made me say that shoots and letters would be so good indeed?

2410
03:02:59,888 --> 03:03:03,931
[SPEAKER_06]: So why'd I have to sell that copper bag of weed?

2411
03:03:03,951 --> 03:03:09,474
[SPEAKER_06]: So Santa, please give me my easy bake oven.

2412
03:03:10,235 --> 03:03:14,998
[SPEAKER_06]: I swear I thought silly ghosts were made for lovin'.

2413
03:03:17,759 --> 03:03:22,002
[SPEAKER_06]: So Santa, won't you accept my apologies?

2414
03:03:27,295 --> 03:03:31,960
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
