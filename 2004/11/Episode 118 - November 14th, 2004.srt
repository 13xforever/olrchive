6
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:23,520
Just kidding, Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that. In this episode...

7
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,520

We are live, and this is episode number 118 for this, November the 14th of 2004.

11
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:06,680
You're tuned in to the internet's most fascinating radio station of all things, be money.

12
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,680
My name is Rob Roberts.

13
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,680
You might know me as Sky.

14
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:12,860
Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts in that corner, the angriest bunny on the

15
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:13,860
farm.

16
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,860
Say hello to Miss Jamie.

17
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,380
Some reason you'll know her better as Dark Sagaroth.

18
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:19,820
I hate my allergies and want them to die.

19
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:20,700
Fair enough.

20
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,460
Also joining us tonight by the other

21
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,460
awesome co-host we have here

22
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:30,740
our tech master, Loki, I'm rolling.

23
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,780
Yes, if you want to know why our webcam isn't up yet

24
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,760
and why we don't have the

25
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,800
dark sacra in our chat room yet over at orangehonser.com

26
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,160
that's because

27
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,820
we're having an emergency

28
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,020
Katamari Damacy

29
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,220
marathon.

30
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,220
Maybe Jamie will tell us about why we have to do that in a little bit.

31
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,820
But I do want to introduce our other guest for tonight.

32
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:51,020
We have a very special guest joining us for the second week in a row.

33
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,820
A lovely surprise. He's in town tonight.

34
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,320
Say hello to Floatwalk.

35
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,220
Whoo! Personal record for me.

36
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,920
That's right. Two in a row.

37
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,120
If you made it next week, you'd have tic-tac-toe.

38
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,320
Wow. And three is a magic number.

39
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,720
It sure is.

40
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,520
All right.

41
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,220
So, Jamie, really fast before we go to the opening break here.

42
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,820
Why is Loki having to play Katamari Damacy right now?

43
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,120
It's so big.

44
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:24,560
Oh, um, because I can only get up to, I've only done the level twice, 256 meters on the

45
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,360
Make the Moon level, and he's got just up to 744, which is awesome.

46
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,360
Wow.

47
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,360
It's so big.

48
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:37,520
Yeah, so that's the only time Lokis are going to hear that in his life, but that's right.

49
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:42,200
Alright, we're going to wrap up Katamari Damacy and put it on the webcam and all that stuff,

50
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,160
So visit OrangeLoungeRadio.com, our website for all the webcam details and stuff.

51
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,760
Tonight we have a lot of special stuff for you during the music break.

52
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,680
The Ultramix 2 website went up earlier this week, we're going to be talking about that

53
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,800
in a little while, but because of that, we got a lot of spoiled fun!

54
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,800
Yay, spoilers!

55
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,800
My favorite.

56
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:04,300
Wow, just take the fun away from us Vivids while we still have them.

57
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,300
You know what?

58
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:09,560
You guys quit like three weeks ago, so as far as I'm concerned, you're done.

59
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,560
We're done with you.

60
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,560
No, I'm kidding.

61
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,960
how it is now we're kidding we definitely want to get the gossip from

62
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:19,560
you later but as long as we have the songs because we have a whole lot of

63
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,840
songs we just we went out there on the internet and everywhere we looked we

64
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,600

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,740

73

Sometimes it's bad, things get bad And I'm not, whoever you are

74
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:39,920
There is light, by my side I feel alright

75
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,920
Cause our love is me

76
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:46,920
Feel them, the two of us

77
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,920
The earth cannot describe

78
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:54,920
How I miss you so much

79
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,920
La, la la la, la la la

80
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,920

00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:06,920
La la la, la la la

00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,920
La-la-la

83
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,920
La-la-la-la-la

84
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,920
You make me high

85
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,920
I can fly

86
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,920
Touch the sky

87
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,920
Wherever you are

88
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,920
I feel free

89
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,920
In ecstasy

90
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,920
You and me

91
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,920
You can take my day

92
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,920
Keep away

93
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,920
And you'll stay

94
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,920
Wherever you are

95
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,920
In my heart

96
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,920
From the start

97
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,920
You'll never fall

98
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:54,920
Because our love is real

99
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,920
Visuals and looks

100
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,920
Two of us

101
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,920
And words cannot describe

102
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,920
How I miss you

103
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:11,920
Oh my, I feel love in your eyes

104
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:18,920
And I feel love when I'm with you

105
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:25,920
I feel love in your eyes

106
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:30,920
Whatever you may be

107
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,920
When I feel blue

108
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,920
I think of you

109
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,920
But you're true

110
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,920
Wherever you are

111
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,920
We won't fall

112
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,920
You still are

113
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,920
The shining star

114
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,920
Sometimes it's bad

115
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,920
Things get bad

116
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,920
And I'm sad

117
00:07:54,920 --> 00:08:02,120
Wherever you are, there is light By my side, I feel all right

118
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:45,920
Gaming Radio, so uncensored, that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

119
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,920
Moo-chah-moo-kaw-key.

120
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,920
Orange Lounge Radio.

121
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,920
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

122
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,920
Turn off that Katamari game already.

123
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,920
That's so last month.

124
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:06,920
Get in the now. No, I know. I'm kidding.

125
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,920
Now apparently Float Walk was impressed because Loki knew about a hidden

126
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,920
game during the credits. Tell us about what's going on there.

127
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,920
Because I unfortunately did not really get into Katamari. I got to like the second stage and then

128
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:26,920
Well, apparently at the end, you see the credits roll and you have a song and you see your little guy running around with the ball.

129
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,920
You can actually move the analog sticks around and you can pick up countries.

130
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:35,920
And so you see a list of countries. You see, you picked up Korea, you picked up Vietnam, all that stuff.

131
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:45,920
I'm sitting here thinking, wow, I haven't seen so many of those countries since Animaniacs when, what was it, Yaqui did United States, Canada, Mexico, Panama, Haiti, Jamaica, Peru, you know.

132
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,920
I just wanted you to sing that song on air because that made me giggle during the break.

133
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:55,920
Alright. Well good. So we made the moon for Jamie.

134
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,920
Good. Now she can't say that we don't do things for her

135
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:05,920
on this show because we make the moon for her.

136
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,920
We gave her the moon to stars and to sky. We swear.

137
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,360
I had to go there.

138
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:19,000
If that was a thread, I would lock it.

139
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,160
Jamie's in the potty right now, so we can't do How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day.

140
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:28,440
She's on her way out, but I'll take a minute to do some announcements.

141
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:33,840
By the way, folks, this is very interesting. Here in the Orange Lounge

142
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,640
Radio Studio,

143
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,240
the bathroom door, the lock is broken.

144
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,240
I was wondering what the hell was up with that.

145
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,440
At any time, somebody could barge in there while you're trying to tinkle.

146
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,600
So please be careful.

147
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,600
Here's the rule.

148
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,920
If the light is on and the fan is running, don't come a-knockin'.

149
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,520
All right.

150
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,720
I couldn't come up with a rhyme for that.

151
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,720
Sorry.

152
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,120
If the fan is running, you better start running.

153
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,360
I think your mic ain't on there.

154
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,360
Try it again.

155
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,240
If the fan is running, you better start running because you never know what they're doing

156
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,240
in there.

157
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,240
Exactly.

158
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,240
Something like that.

159
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,240
Anyway.

160
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,240
Oh, yeah.

161
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,520
Did you hear, maybe we've mentioned it a couple times, that we're going to be doing a really

162
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:17,120
big giveaway here on OrangeLawnsRadio and I'm not talking about, you know, no small

163
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,360
time little, you know, yada yada giveaway.

164
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,080
We're talking really big news here.

165
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:28,000
We are giving away, in conjunction with ddrspot.com, that's kind of why Floatwalk's here tonight

166
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,580
because he's a big part of the DDR Spot community, OrangeLawnsRadio in conjunction with ddrspot.com

167
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:38,900
is giving away signed Akira Yomoka CDs.

168
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:42,220
cool we're gonna be giving away two of them so the contest is gonna go for two

169
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:46,260
weeks now here's the thing though we changed the rules a little bit from what

170
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:49,640
we talked about last week and I yeah because we can't basically is what it

171
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,820
boils down to now and I know you love it when you hear that we change the rules

172
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:57,380
but no actually we did it to make the contest easier for you so here's the

173
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:01,820
deal now forget what I said previously about how it's gonna work well how it's

174
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,380
gonna work now is that you know we have spin-off shows here on orange launch

175
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:08,180
radio every Monday night diversion yours laundry a remix show every Tuesday night

176
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:12,180
Pump Up the Volume with Dark Sagra, and every Thursday night, Outside the Box with yours truly.

177
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:17,180
All of which are on at 7, although Pump Up the Volume technically starts at 7.30.

178
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:24,180
You gotta listen to those spin-off shows, and during the show at any time, we're gonna ask a trivia question about Akira Yomoka,

179
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:29,180
or it could be about something Akira Yomoka was involved with, such as Silent Hill series would be a great one.

180
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:33,180
We're gonna ask a trivia question. If you know the answer to the trivia question,

181
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:39,180
send an email to akira at orange lounge radio dot com and you will be entered into the contest.

182
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:43,180
That's the change. You don't have to listen all three nights to be entered.

183
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:48,180
But what the change does allow us to do is that if you do listen all three nights

184
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:53,180
and you send us three emails with three different answers, you'll be entered in the contest three times.

185
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:58,180
So you have three times the chance of somebody else if you listen all week long.

186
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:02,300
But if you have a busy schedule and you can only listen one night, you can still get one

187
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,760
entry into the contest.

188
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:11,820
So the contest starts tomorrow on the 15th, and it's going to run through the 20, it looks

189
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:16,620
like the last entry chance to be on the 25th, Thanksgiving, how appropriate.

190
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:21,020
Thanksgiving Day will be your last chance to enter, so look for that.

191
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:25,540
Alright, so I just wanted to kind of get that out there, talk about the Kiriyomuoka contest.

192
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:29,940
I also have another big announcement about the show, but let's wait till we get after

193
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:33,640
How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day, because DDR Spot is not the only big Bomani site we're

194
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,740
working with.

195
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:40,460
We have another big, I know, I know, but basically, I think we all feel we're gonna whore ourselves

196
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,860
anywhere that'll pay for it, so, or not, even though...

197
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,240
So who is this third party in the whole menage?

198
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:49,340
I'm gonna tell ya, I'm gonna tell ya, as soon as we finish this segment here, with

199
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:52,180
How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day, some folks already know, some folks have already

200
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:57,820
figured it out, but we will tell you officially what's going on in a minute.

201
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,580
As I said, we've got to start off every week's show with a little bit of how was your week,

202
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:04,920
how was your day, and of course the lovely Dark Sakura, starting us off as always.

203
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:13,340
My week was insanely busy, just school everything, and then today my allergies have been killing

204
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,340
me all day.

205
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:20,580
It's been trying to not get sick and everyone's getting sick around me, but I'm hoping that

206
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:26,260
running away to Alabama in a another week I'll be escaping the whole thing so

207
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:37,220
um but apart from that I really didn't do a whole bunch of anything um dot dot

208
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:43,620
dot as really it's really been nothing but that school and hanging out and just

209
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:50,220
the same little crap I normally do so now as for Rob's week first he went on

210
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:54,460
on an expedition to Alaska, where the Eskimos kidnapped him

211
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,460
and made him their king.

212
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:58,100
Stop telling lies while I'm out of the room.

213
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,940
Although, that did happen, actually.

214
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,380
It was three weeks ago, not last week.

215
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:01,900
Oh, my bad.

216
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:02,980
Yeah, your bad.

217
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,580
Oh, anyway, sorry.

218
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:08,740
I had to check on my laundry, because when Jamie comes over,

219
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,840
she likes to not only do orange laundry.

220
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,820
This is how we pay Jamie for doing the show,

221
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:15,460
since we don't have money to exactly give out to people.

222
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:18,580
We pay in laundry, in clean laundry.

223
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,580
That way I don't have to use our...

224
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,580
Hey, that's worth a lot of quarters for the arcade.

225
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,580
...orange lounge.

226
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,580
All right.

227
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,580
And I'll pay you back in... in... sinus school.

228
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,580
Uh-huh, hooray.

229
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,580
Just what I always wanted.

230
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,580
All right, uh, see, that's it?

231
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,580
My week was boring.

232
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,580
Well, then, what's up with that? Like, the past two weeks you've been boring.

233
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,580
I've been training people.

234
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,580
The past two weeks.

235
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,580
All right. Well, I train people too. That's my job.

236
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,580
Well, yeah, but I'm gonna be going to Alabama, though, next week.

237
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,700
Alabama though next week well that's oh you're not gonna be here for next week's

238
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:55,820
show well I will be here Sunday but that's the week as Wednesday the 24th

239
00:15:55,820 --> 00:16:04,260
okay moving on actually next Sunday is gonna be an interesting show because I

240
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:07,380
have to get up at 4 in the morning on that Monday I'm going to LA for a day

241
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:11,180
for work so I didn't even think I'd be able to do the show but it does look

242
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:15,820
like I will be able to do show not that you care anyway flow walk since you

243
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:19,780
You have a microphone, why don't you let us know, how was your week, how was your day?

244
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:25,500
Week was different because as I just started my new job over at Princeton Review up in

245
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:32,820
the city and it's just really weird just seeing like just all the stuff that goes on because

246
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:38,620
mostly I do like I do a lot of like online type QA so all the college applications they

247
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:43,060
do online I'm working on all that kind of stuff it's kind of funny well also kind of

248
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:46,060
depressing in the sense that I'm sitting here thinking,

249
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:49,780
I used to do this stuff for AltaVista about four years ago,

250
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,580
and I got paid about three times as much

251
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:54,340
to do the same exact work I'm doing now.

252
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,220
And you'd always think it would be kind of opposite

253
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,300
considering inflation, all that kind of stuff.

254
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,900
Yeah, now I'd be making more since I've been there,

255
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,880
done that, and it's just like regression,

256
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,880
and it's kind of a trippy feeling, really.

257
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,860
Other than that, it's just mostly been,

258
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,740
yeah, just busy type of work week,

259
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:19,740
And then, it's all on the personal side, I've actually been up in SACTO this week and I'm just, you know, visiting friends, you know, that kind of stuff.

260
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:26,740
Just kind of getting reacquainted with more games and all that jazz, been like playing SmackDown vs Raw ad nauseam now.

261
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:33,740
And, uh, let's see, gosh, it's, um, yeah, it's been a pretty tame week all things considered.

262
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:38,740
Well, now that, you know, this coming week, we've got the whole UltraMix 2 thing coming out and stuff, so,

263
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:43,220
I'm sort of, you know, kind of thinking here, well, what can I officially disclaim, you

264
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,100
know, as of right now, and...

265
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:48,500
Yeah, it's like, what parts of the NDA can I blab about now?

266
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:52,060
But it's got to be a little bit of a relief now that most of the song list is out there,

267
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,620
that you can kind of go, okay...

268
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:59,460
Oh, and for the record, I did not leave Konami in the first place, as I see in the chat room.

269
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:03,520
I was actually laid off, which is actually, it's a little something that I'll probably

270
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,940
get into later, because it's probably an interesting note about what goes on, you know, the inner

271
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:12,180
workings of a crazy lab like that there's been lots of shake-ups in the

272
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:15,020
video game world lately

273
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,940
we'll get to know one of the other ones later

274
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,140
yeah yeah funny enough

275
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,180
but uh... let's see and then you know

276
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,220
like that today now it's just like

277
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,960
since i was up in fact i figured what the heck you know i'll just come on the

278
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,700
orange lounge and uh...

279
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,180
show them a good time or something and it's really weird because normally i

280
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:33,820
have a sharks girl with me and she's not here and it's kind of

281
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,020
bummed, but...

282
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,040
Maybe she's listening!

283
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:39,000
Perhaps, and she was uh...

284
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,300
but she was up here one time when I wasn't, so I think uh... we're uh...

285
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:46,100
That was a long time ago, it was years ago, but yes, she was here one time when you weren't, I remember that.

286
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:46,900
Okay.

287
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,860
But uh, while I was laid off, I see you on the uh...

288
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,200
in the room.

289
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,720
Well, you knew it was going to come up.

290
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,500
Well, yeah. Well, I mean, it's really not a surprise for anyone...

291
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:00,220
for anyone who hasn't been familiar with the game industry or just QA in general.

292
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:05,380
Usually you're commissioned as working on a single project or just projects when they're

293
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,380
available.

294
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:10,700
The way the video game industry works is usually they'll get their games around springtime

295
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,060
or like early summer.

296
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:17,500
Usually they start doing QA for demos for like E3 just to make sure everything's stable

297
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,500
enough.

298
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,380
Once that goes around, then obviously you go into development and of course you need

299
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,380
testers.

300
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,660
Then you test throughout the summer, do like early fall.

301
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,860
Once all the products get pushed out, I mean...

302
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:33,100
Because everything, the big time for the gaming season is Christmas, so basically the games

303
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,540
are being tested a couple months before then, right?

304
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,540
Right.

305
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:39,640
But you don't see a lot of big games coming out in January, February, unless you're Nintendo

306
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,640
this year.

307
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,780
I don't know if Nintendo has huge games coming out, but...

308
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:43,780
But, um...

309
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:47,740
Oh yeah, well you gotta, okay, a few here and there, but Sweet Coz 4 was supposed to

310
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,740
be out Christmas, wasn't it?

311
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:49,740
Yeah, it was.

312
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:53,740
It was supposed to be part of that big Konami extravaganza blowout thingamabob, but, um...

313
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,740
Sunday, Sunday, Sunday!

314
00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:03,740
But once around November rolls around, they don't have any projects left.

315
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:07,740
The only thing you really do at Canine, for example, is once all that's done,

316
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:11,740
you'll probably either be doing a few text checks or you're doing customer service.

317
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:15,740
What really I found curious was they downsized customer service.

318
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:18,740
And you would think, around this time when all their new tiles are coming out,

319
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:22,740
you need people to support people.

320
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:28,140
like well you know this game is crashing on my PC and that's like 90% of any problems people have

321
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:33,700
like you know issues with Konami is like you know PC games well you know I'm running a P2 how come

322
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:38,460
I can't play Silent Hill 4 DVD or ROM and you're just sitting there like shaking your head like

323
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:42,860
man these people and then of course you get like a ton of foreign emails saying you know why can't

324
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:48,220
I play Winning 11-8 you know that's like anytime you get a email from Brazil or like Europe or you

325
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:52,680
you know, and that kind of stuff. It's always Winning Eleven or Silent Hill. You know, it's

326
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,680
always PC games.

327
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:57,960
I want to address a couple of points that are in our chat room, www.orangelaunsradio.com,

328
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:04,280
click on chat. Totion says, if you aren't a part of X company, isn't the NDA dissolved?

329
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,280
And I don't think that's not true at all.

330
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:10,800
Oh no, oh no, no, that's hardly the case. I mean, it's like, I mean, you can essentially

331
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:15,200
say, yeah, I worked on it. You can, you know, say something specific. But, I mean, NDA is

332
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:21,200
They use that for stuff like, well obviously I couldn't tell you what kind of software they used for, you know, engineering the game.

333
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:27,200
That's like what NDA's are, it's not so much to protect, like, yeah, this is what we're doing. Unless it's a top secret project, you know, that no one knows about.

334
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,200
But since, like, say, you know, a game is public knowledge, you can say like, yeah, I'm testing it. What about it do you want to know?

335
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:36,200
It's like, well obviously I can't say what's in the game, you know, at the time.

336
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:40,200
Why don't I have a look? I happen to be doing my homework here.

337
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:45,200
Jamie just pulled out her big business law textbook, just going to thumb through it and see what it says on it.

338
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,200
Yeah, it's essentially to protect more or less intellectual property of Konami.

339
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:54,200
I would compare it to, let's say, the folks that go on that game show Survivor, right?

340
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:58,200
You got 16 people to go on the show, the damn thing's taped months in advance.

341
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,200
They already know who won the damn thing, or at least they know who the two finalists are,

342
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:07,200
but the contestants are still all under that gag order where they can't talk about it until it airs on TV

343
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,200
you don't want to get sued for $110000,000,000

344
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,200
Yeah, yeah, that's essentially what it all boils down to

345
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,200
I mean, I have no problem adhering to that or anything like that

346
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,200
Yeah, you don't want to get sued for $110000,000,000

347
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,200
Yeah, and you don't want to lose your job just because you want to sound cool

348
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,200
and like, oh yeah, I got the inside scoop

349
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:28,200
I mean, it's a good thing that at least I'm pretty close with Jason

350
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,200
You know, it's because most of the stuff we do is DDR-related

351
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,200
So any time I ever even get tempted to say anything

352
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,480
I'd talk to him first and be like, you know, is this cool, is this cool?

353
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,840
I knew that Delirium was going to be on UltraMix 2 before any of you.

354
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,840
My internet penis is huge!

355
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,840
I have it if you're ready, by the way.

356
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,840
Oh, okay.

357
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,840
Yes, sir.

358
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,840
Yeah.

359
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,840
I mean, you'd be surprised.

360
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,720
There are actually people who come to work for, you know, Konami at the time, and like,

361
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,920
one day they'll say, yeah, Rumble Roses was in office, and you know, stuff like that,

362
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,680
and like, the guy will just get canned, like, in one hour.

363
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,680
Wow.

364
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:02,000
So, they're pretty serious about stuff like that.

365
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,400
But I mean, overall, as long as you know when to say when and just all that, you know, it's

366
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,400
not a bad thing.

367
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,400
Interesting.

368
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,400
Jamie, yes, your textbook.

369
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,400
The textbook definition.

370
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:17,200
NDAs have been around for a long time and traditionally have been used among lawyers,

371
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,320
investment bankers, and others involved in trade takeovers and other large corporate

372
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,320
deals.

373
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,520
NDAs swear the signatory to secrecy about confidential ideas, trade secrets, and other

374
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:30,000
non-public information revealed by the party proffering the NDA.

375
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:36,000
So, it's an actual contract and it's binding despite employment and anything else.

376
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
There you have it.

377
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
So, in other words, he ain't talking! You ain't gonna make me talk!

378
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I mean, basically, if you said, yeah, X Song is gonna be in DDR, it could be sued for breach of contract.

379
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Oh, yeah, but see, that's why I let everyone else handle all that. I mean, it's really gone to the point...

380
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Although, at the same time, is it really that big a deal?

381
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Yes, and...

382
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I guess so, with the licenses it could be, but especially when some licenses get cut right before the game comes out, I mean that's a big deal.

383
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Oh yeah, I mean, you know, if not for people basically going through and hacking party collections, you would have, you know, you wouldn't have known about the songs that never made it into DDR for, you know, whatever reason or all that kind of stuff.

384
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,200
and funny enough it's usually licenses first

385
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,960
that you know are often announced because obviously you need something to

386
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,200
sell the game in

387
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,600
you know you want to give the public something that's a familiar

388
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,740
title that they can relate to like they say

389
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,840
oh wow you know such-and-such artist yeah they're popular wow they got them in DDR

390
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,960
that must be you know

391
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,960
pretty big thing

392
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:38,620
but at the same time the reason why you want to like keep gagging on specialty licenses is

393
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:41,480
I mean nothing's ever really set in stone there are sometimes when you think you have a

394
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,020
license in the bag and like it's a slam dunk

395
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:47,540
next thing you know like the carpet gets yanked out so

396
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:52,980
I mean it's to cover us from getting like egg f***ing young on our face or anything

397
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,540
alright well fair enough

398
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,540
that's what you gotta do

399
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:59,540
moving on we were doing how was your day before we got on that little tangent

400
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:02,620
I actually forgot to mention something that happened during my week

401
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:09,060
I uh... I sprained my wrist and they put me in a cast on Thursday and I cut it off

402
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:12,660
you took the law into your own hands or you took the law of medicine into your own hands

403
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:15,660
Yeah, and I'm not wearing my brace either, because it sucks.

404
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,660
Okay, I'm done.

405
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,660
Do you have any pictures of you in the cast, though?

406
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:22,660
I do, I have one online, but since I can't access the chatroom, I can't post it.

407
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:29,660
I know, for some reason, I don't know why, but other side IRC, the network raises only lets two simultaneous connections from our house.

408
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:36,660
Actually, go to www.darksakura.com slash images slash fuckcast.jpg

409
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:40,660
Okay, I will put that in and then post it in the chatroom if somebody doesn't beat me to it.

410
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,660
In the meantime, Loki!

411
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,660
How was your week, how was your day?

412
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,660
My week was, you know, it was okay.

413
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:48,660
It was fine.

414
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,660
Totally got this fucking headache today!

415
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:52,660
And then it went really shitty!

416
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:57,660
I don't understand it, I get headaches on Sundays.

417
00:25:58,660 --> 00:25:59,660
Why?

418
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:04,660
It's always on Sundays, and it's always a sinus pressure headache.

419
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:08,660
I think I'm allergic to something in this house, it's gotta be...

420
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:23,300
a bad headache. And it's only on Sundays, so it must be Jamie. It was before she came

421
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:31,260
over. Yeah, I'm not, I'm hypoallergenic. So, yeah, it hurts and I'm trying to, I'm looking

422
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:37,060
at home remedies on the internet right now. I have all the remedy here. It's called Vicks

423
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:39,060
Vapourrub and the tube.

424
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:10,880
which I'm sure a lot of you guys are very proud to hear I'll tell you what

425
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,380
though man we were talking about this a little bit on outside the box on

426
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:18,680
Thursday but the Xbox live stuff is so detailed it's crazy being able to go on

427
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:23,740
to bungee.net and see your statistics down to you can pull up a map of the

428
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:28,300
game you just played and look at where you were killed and when by who is crazy

429
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:32,060
and what weapon they used to kill you it's just insane the mouse is after that

430
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:35,380
so I've been having fun playing that online although yesterday I did not have

431
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:38,340
Well, I'll get into that in the FUs of the week.

432
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:41,940
And then, what else did I do this week?

433
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:44,520
I'm not a whole lot Bamani related.

434
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:48,500
Because of Halo 2, my DDR diet fizzled pretty quickly there.

435
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,580
So I gotta get back into that.

436
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:52,900
I'm really hoping that UltraMix 2 coming out this week is gonna motivate me to get dancing

437
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:57,500
again so I hope to see a lot of our listeners on Xbox Live come Friday when the game comes

438
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,500
out.

439
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:03,820
And we will be doing a special show when the game is released probably on 20 November actually,

440
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:04,820
on Saturday.

441
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:11,340
November special. Coincidence? Absolutely not. As far as the rest of my week and my

442
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:14,660
day, I didn't really do a whole lot, although I did go to Rice Princess, you

443
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:17,940
know her from outside the box on Thursday nights, she had her Harry Potter birthday

444
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:22,260
party on Friday and that was a lot of fun because we drank butter beer and I

445
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:26,100
drank all sorts of liquor and I passed out on the floor. In great tradition of

446
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:29,060
me going to a party at Rice Princess and Lanky Style's house, I passed out

447
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:34,180
halfway through the party and I really, I lost big time on Harry Potter trivia.

448
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:38,260
that made me sad but you know since I don't read the books I was kind of

449
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:42,700
screwed in the beginning but then this is the weird thing then the next night

450
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:46,620
after the Harry Potter party the next night what do they show on TV Harry

451
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:54,420
Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone coincidence I think I think it's a big

452
00:28:54,420 --> 00:29:00,100
fat coincidence you shut up all right that's pretty much it for my week of my

453
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:04,060
day I don't have a whole lot exciting to report although there is a lot of

454
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:07,780
interesting stuff going on locally now i know that we are an international show

455
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:11,460
we've got listeners in canada japan everywhere and all across the u s but

456
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,940
sometimes we like to talk about what's going on in our deck of the woods here

457
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:16,260
in norcal in sacramento the area where we're at

458
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:19,420
we've heard a very interesting rumor and mel you actually were the one that

459
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:22,300
started perpetuating this rumor cuz i guess you've heard this from the horse's

460
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:22,900
mouth

461
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:23,820
hahaha

462
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:24,620
well

463
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:27,980
derby owners club is coming

464
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:32,780
to sacramento from milpitas it's leaving milpitas bye bye and it's coming to

465
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:35,180
Roswell Golfland, what games go to die?

466
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:41,020
Yes, that does put a tear in my eye.

467
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:44,660
I guess probably there's a couple reasons why it's coming up there.

468
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:49,780
I think it's gone to the point where Milpitas, you know, you had a lot of people who were

469
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:53,240
interested in the beginning and obviously it garnered a lot of, you know, people coming

470
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,100
through a lot of traffic.

471
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:58,480
Then a couple factors, I mean, you got D&B, which is like about a mile and a half, two

472
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,280
miles away, which has it.

473
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:05,320
It obviously pulls a lot of money, and I think some of the older folks like going there for

474
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:10,040
the simple fact that you can actually get drunk and play, and all that kind of stuff.

475
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,880
And you don't have to deal with birthday parties.

476
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,120
Yes, seriously.

477
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:19,800
And obviously, Roseville is a pretty high traffic area, from what I hear.

478
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,200
And there's none left.

479
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:27,200
If you love underage girls in bikinis, you will love Roseville Golf Land.

480
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,000
I love Roseville Golf Land.

481
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,160
I heart. Yeah, so it's going to be the first one up in that region of California, like

482
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:38,300
SACTO, and I know there are a lot of people up here who like the game and have come down

483
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:43,480
and played it and still keep their horses around. And yes, Derby Owners Club is like

484
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,320
the initial D for Rednecks.

485
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:50,880
I know for a fact from last week's show, Iguana Girl and Islander are all about Derby Owners

486
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,920
Club. They'll be there. I will have to hang my head in shame and go into that place, and

487
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:29,240
it must be true. Rumor is, yeah, if it's not on the internet it must be true, but rumor

488
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:34,520
is that Sacramento is going to get 2DX again. And it's coming courtesy of Camelot Golf Land,

489
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:39,160
sorry guys. That's the rumor we hear, that Camelot Golf Land's 2DX machine is coming

490
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:44,880
up here. Sorry, but not really. I don't, I think that's a little more, I think the source

491
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:50,820
is more reliable than the usual 2DX is coming to my neck of the woods source, but I still

492
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:55,620
have such skepticism because I just, and the rumor is it's supposed to be upgraded to red

493
00:31:55,620 --> 00:32:01,480
by the time he gets there. Yippee! But the thing is that I would be so scared for that

494
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:05,040
machine because it would die very quickly when all the kids start pounding on it with

495
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:11,760
their wet little Gulfland slide fingers. Bimani machines don't deserve to be treated that

496
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:18,000
way. No they don't. By me I think like I said it all boils down to the bottom line. I mean

497
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,520
are more people going to come out to like friggin Livermore to go play 2DX or like Sacto?

498
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:26,520
I mean, you take your pick.

499
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,520
What, are you talking on Sacramento now?

500
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:34,520
No, I was saying people are going to come to SACTO, not Livermore, or whatever Camelot

501
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,520
is.

502
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,520
That is Livermore, yeah.

503
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,520
I think?

504
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,520
I don't know.

505
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,520
Oh.

506
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,520
No, I think it's in the south somewhere.

507
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,520
It's Anaheim.

508
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,520
Oh, the Anaheim one?

509
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,520
Oh, okay.

510
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,520
My bad.

511
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,520
I think.

512
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,520
Oh, okay.

513
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,520
Wow.

514
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,520
But I think it's-

515
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,520
I'm not sure about geography.

516
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,520
That's right.

517
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:54,400
tunnel vision screen i don't know the one where you have no no no that was

518
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:59,200
she was she had a night vision but didn't shingles machine go to camelot

519
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,700
i'd not be surprised when she got lost i think so i think she goes machine with

520
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:05,740
the camelot now it might become an erosive

521
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:08,600
she will is now an apartment complex but i don't know

522
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:15,600
dead like this go

523
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,600
That was insane!

524
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:50,040
people will play. It's like you kind of go to a point where you start low, start low

525
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:55,400
and then you eventually start getting a lot of people playing. And then like almost any

526
00:33:55,400 --> 00:34:00,480
other game you outgrow it. And there was only like so many hardcore people that still stayed

527
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:05,920
around and played. I mean they're obviously in an uproar right now. But it's like they're

528
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:11,160
having their farewell send off this weekend. Like they had a G1 tournament. So it's like

529
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:15,760
They have a bunch of people playing, it's like a hundred bucks to enter, but seriously,

530
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,760
these people are like freaking G's when it comes to playing this game.

531
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:23,520
I mean, they're like, yeah, I got a 30th generation, you know, thunderboy princess, and you can't

532
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,500
be beat on dirt and et cetera, et cetera.

533
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:31,600
And it's, I mean, I'd be in the tournament if it didn't cost a hundred bucks a pop to

534
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,600
play, you know.

535
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,680
Is it true that there's celebrities that come to play?

536
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,220
Um, yeah, actually.

537
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:42,220
Funny enough, the people that, as far as celebrities that are interested in it, are mostly athletes

538
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:46,940
because they need to do something during their down time, so like at the D&B over in Milpitas,

539
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:51,620
a lot of the 49ers would come there because their practice camp is in Santa Clara, which

540
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,480
is just down to 27.

541
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:58,660
And then when you talk about other cities, like San Diego, some of the Chargers played

542
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:59,660
there.

543
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,820
There was a baseball player on Albert Bell.

544
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:06,220
Now I'm surprised that Sweat from G4 doesn't come film these guys playing Derby Owners

545
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:10,220
Club because that's all that's ever on that show are sports people because apparently

546
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:13,260
they are the only celebrities that actually play video games.

547
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:15,260
Them and Ayesha Tyler.

548
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:20,360
Yeah, athletes, I mean, they're definitely all about video games in the locker rooms

549
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,940
or you know, just like on their off days.

550
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:28,820
And yeah, I mean all that pounding on a machine will definitely work out to Sweat.

551
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:35,900
Alright, uh, well, hopefully, maybe we'll start seeing some celebrities at, uh, Roseville

552
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:36,900
Golf Land, though I doubt it.

553
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,820
You never know, you probably might see some- Maybe Schwarzenegger, that's the only celebrity

554
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:40,820
that lives in Sacramento.

555
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,820
Well, that and, like, the Kings.

556
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:47,540
Oh, Vasta, you whore!

557
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:48,540
I'm going to whip you!

558
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:49,540
I'm going to whip you!

559
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:52,540
I'm going to whip you like the Indian casinos!

560
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:58,260
If you do that, we never gulp you!

561
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,660
On that note, we're going to go to a break. We're going to continue the...

562
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:01,660
Girly horse!

563
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:08,460
Girly horse, you're a girly horse, a silly little girly horse.

564
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:11,300
Welcome to Orange Laundry Radio, everybody. I am going to get to that announcement, but

565
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:15,260
we'll go to a break first, because I like announcements after breaks. It's just me.

566
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:21,220
In this break, another brand new UltraMix 2 song, as spoiled by the website, which went

567
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:24,180
up over the weekend. If you want a link to that, just visit orangelaundry.com. We have

568
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:26,940
a link right there. It's like our top news story.

569
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:29,060
and her

570
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,260
in this break

571
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,980
well

572
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:35,100
we're just joined by explicit randomly during every that's right we're going to

573
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,980
go to a break right now

574
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:42,220
this song is the interesting thing about this song it's also in

575
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:44,540
that other dancing game

576
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:47,220
and we'll talk about that and how interesting that must be

577
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,300
the song is vanilla ninja

578
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,520
and it's called tough enough

579
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:55,280
who i really like the song all of an awesome song and it was like my favorite

580
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,680
song in that other dancing game we're going to talk about that when we come

581
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,680
We'll be right back after this.

582
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,680
of his broken sheen

583
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,680
So keep on looking for peace

584
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,680
If you don't stop, don't fear

585
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,680
Run away, go for the fire

586
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,680
Baby, that's up to none

587
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,680
Keep on living, don't stop

588
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,680
Even the devil

589
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,680
Get you from the sea

590
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,680
Let the clouds rain

591
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,680
Baby, that's up to none

592
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:57,680
Oh, baby, I'm so in love

593
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:05,680
When you feel it, the things you've been saying

594
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:09,680
Never touch my smiley face

595
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,680
You're such a change on your dreams

596
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:21,680
I'm a disco face, feelings you can't take

597
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:27,680
But keep on looking for me, looking don't stop, don't feel run away

598
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:31,680
I wanna fly, yeah, baby, I'm just a nun

599
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:36,680
Don't keep on living, don't stop feeling the devil in me

600
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:41,680
Get you in the seat with a pile of rain, baby, I'm just a nun

601
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:23,720
We're gonna do one more song here in this Ultramix 2 break.

602
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:27,720
We're gonna do, whoops, nope, not that, that's not an Ultramix 2.

603
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:31,360
We're gonna do, which one did I want to do here, ah, here it is.

604
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:37,960
This is an interesting song, it's, the band is called Or If Is, like Or If Is, get it?

605
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:44,960
and it's called I Spy. Enjoy!

606
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,960
Oh

607
00:42:37,960 --> 00:43:05,360
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio and that break you heard Orifis with a song called

608
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:14,160
I Spy, and before that, Vanilla Ninja would toughen up. Now, I remember when I first heard

609
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:18,640
that song, I was kind of like, wait a minute, I've heard this before. And I was like, what

610
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:23,180
the hell have I heard this before? Oh my God, this song was on In the Groove when I went

611
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:28,600
back and played it in Jersey a few months ago. Coincidence? What the hell happened there?

612
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:32,760
I don't know, but I would be surprised if, you know, I mean, because Vanilla Ninja is

613
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:36,700
is a German group, I would be surprised if they just kind of like were of the opinion

614
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:41,140
hey lets pour out our song to as many people as possible and that very well might have

615
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:42,140
been the case.

616
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:48,320
Now obviously since games are tested and planned for months in advance, this song was included

617
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:51,620
in Ultramix 2 before In the Groove was ever released right?

618
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:54,020
Honestly I don't know the timing on that one.

619
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:58,700
I'm pretty sure it was, I think so but we'll see.

620
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:01,860
So this is very interesting, anything else you want to share?

621
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:04,860
It's the only song in UltraMix 2 that has a video, right?

622
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:05,860
It has a music video?

623
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:07,860
It does have a music video, yes.

624
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:08,860
Interesting.

625
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:09,860
Yeah.

626
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:11,860
And they're not some bad looking girls either.

627
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:16,860
I mean, kind of like, you know, take Vixen or like any of those female hair metal bands

628
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:20,860
and kind of pop them up a little and yeah.

629
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:23,860
You got Vanilla Ninja and they actually have a website out there and all that kind of stuff

630
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:28,860
and I wish I knew German so I could get myself a free autograph.

631
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:33,860
So if anyone can do some German translation for me, holler back.

632
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:37,860
Autographbitte.

633
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:40,860
So can you tell us anything else about the video?

634
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:44,860
Because I'm assuming if we could look hard enough we could probably find the video, but I don't know.

635
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:50,860
Well, it's a pretty, you know, rocking video. It's like, obviously you've got the vammers playing.

636
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:57,860
I guess the best way to describe it in a nutshell is, if you took Christina Aguilera's dirty video and made it, like, presentable

637
00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:04,140
like the ESRB wouldn't nail us. It's kind of, well, it's just more so the setting, but

638
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:09,100
it's a cool video. I mean, it's a hell of a lot less scandalous than Do That Thing from

639
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:10,100
UltraMix 1, so.

640
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:15,580
Oh, no, we're talking about Vanilla Ninja's Tough Enough from UltraMix 2.

641
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:20,620
Yeah, like you said, I know you've been out of it. There's a whole lot of UltraMix 2 news

642
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:21,620
this week, so.

643
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:28,180
That's all right, well actually if you want to see, because actually the way we know that

644
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:31,340
that video is in there is that actually if you go to the Ultramix 2 website, there's

645
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:35,820
a still, one of the screenshots they have has the video in it, so you can kind of get

646
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:39,780
a little glimpse of what it looks like there.

647
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:42,820
But they're easy on the eyes, for the most part.

648
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:43,820
Definitely.

649
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:47,440
I think actually because when somebody on DDR Freak made the connection that that was

650
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,820
the Vanilla Ninja video, I think they actually linked to the video I want to say.

651
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:52,220
I think you can go check it out over there.

652
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:58,020
I just was too lazy to check it out myself.

653
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:01,620
So moving on, we just got some more guests in the house here.

654
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:02,620
Like you, Sal.

655
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:03,620
How was your week?

656
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:04,620
How was your day?

657
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:05,620
Pretty good.

658
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:06,620
Just been working.

659
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:07,620
Yep.

660
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:08,620
Had the big party.

661
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:09,620
Oh, wow.

662
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:10,620
It's so weird to hear you and work together.

663
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:11,620
You know what?

664
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:13,340
Fuck you, buddy.

665
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:16,340
It's so weird to hear you and attractive in the same sentence.

666
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:17,340
Wait.

667
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:18,860
Nobody said that, though.

668
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:19,860
Anyway.

669
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:24,960
a big birthday party that you were at, you know, the awesome geeky Harry Potter birthday

670
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:25,960
party.

671
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:26,960
It was the one where I passed out halfway through it.

672
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:27,960
Yeah, on my bed.

673
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:28,960
In Great Rob's Kitchen.

674
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:31,100
Does my bed say Rob's Passout Place?

675
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:32,100
You know why?

676
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:35,380
Everybody, when I passed out on the floor, like, people would come by and kick my ass,

677
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:36,380
literally.

678
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:37,380
Oh, I kick your ass too.

679
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:38,380
Rob's Passout Kick.

680
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:43,780
So at one point I was like, God damn it, and I just went to the first place, I knew there

681
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:44,780
was a bed.

682
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:48,420
I wasn't exactly going to go into your roommate's room and pass out on their bed.

683
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:49,420
That would have been interesting.

684
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:51,420
That would have been kind of funny, actually.

685
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:53,420
Yeah, but we don't need to get into that.

686
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:54,420
Yeah, that's right. That's right.

687
00:46:54,420 --> 00:47:00,420
Anyway, other than that, I've been working and making the dough. Yep, good stuff.

688
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:02,420
Alright, good stuff.

689
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:05,420
Explicit also joined us during the break there. How was your week? How was your day?

690
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:10,420
Okay, basically I'm up and down. The break is actually I moved to a new house and stuff.

691
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:17,420
Looks very nice. Two-story house. Got my own bathroom. Got two bedrooms I can now sleep on.

692
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:21,420
Wait, you have two bedrooms all to yourself?

693
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:25,420
Well, sort of anyway. So what, you have your weekend bed and your weekday bed?

694
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:29,420
Or is there one bedroom that's for the ladies, and then one bedroom...

695
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:33,420
Oh yeah! Speaking of ladies,

696
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:37,420
I'm supposed to go to a strip club next two weeks

697
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:41,420
to sell them to my cousin's 18th birthdays.

698
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:45,420
Guess I'm gonna have to eat some pussy again.

699
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:51,420
You know what? Go Club! I don't need to hear that.

700
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:57,420
Go Club Silverpoles. Wow, I was wondering when this show was going to go on the toilet. Thank you.

701
00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:01,420
But I missed what it was about. That's quite alright.

702
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:05,420
50 straight casts. Anyway.

703
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:10,420
I already talked about Halo 2. That was pretty much my week.

704
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:15,420
Anything new going on at Paradise Island? The place where you work? You're still working there, right?

705
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:16,420
Yeah.

706
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:17,420
Anything new going on?

707
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:23,420
We might get a new arcade vendor. There's a possibility since, for some stupid reason, they're not updating their machines anymore.

708
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:28,420
Because pad vending is like, I think we're losing contract and stuff.

709
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:33,420
We might get a vendor from the Bay Area and stuff so we can get, oh yeah.

710
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:37,420
So I can talk to them by trying to get BeatMania 2DX Red there.

711
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:48,020
That'd be nice. Interesting. Interesting. Is it a bitch to work through a vendor?

712
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:53,420
Hell yeah! I had a deal with them during the last tournament for FU.

713
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:59,720
I'm not sure if I'll have to deal with them again in February for SAC-TAC SmackDown tournament.

714
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:03,120
Yes, I'm organizing another tournament in Sacramento.

715
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:04,920
Alright, we'll be there, I'm sure.

716
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:06,620
It's early February.

717
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:17,580
will be there. Alright. Let's see, I'm just preparing for SVGL3. SVGL3, the tournament

718
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:22,780
in December. That's right, I completely forgot about that. I'm definitely going to that.

719
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:25,900
I just kind of forgot that it was right around the corner. Like, didn't they announce that

720
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:30,860
tournament like months ago? Yeah, it was supposedly during the summertime, but they moved it to

721
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:32,860
into the winter, I'm assuming.

722
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:34,860
And then it was supposedly cancelled because

723
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:39,860
I assume DCB doesn't want to be the main organizer for it anymore.

724
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:41,860
Well, I'm sure somebody will pick it up if you didn't want to.

725
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:42,860
I don't know what's going on.

726
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:43,860
Someone else picked it up already.

727
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:45,860
I've been so out of the loop on that stuff.

728
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:48,860
I was so out of the loop ever since the drama and shit coming around.

729
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:51,860
Like, oh, I got screwed up, B.A.

730
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:52,860
Gah!

731
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:54,860
For certain people.

732
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:55,860
All right.

733
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:57,860
According to the rules.

734
00:49:57,860 --> 00:50:00,860
The Dalles all announce the FU's.

735
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:03,860
Let's back up six inches there. Let's back up.

736
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:06,860
Back up. Literally, the mic. Back it up.

737
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:07,860
There you go.

738
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:14,860
And for the Dalles all announce later, it's going to be one hell of a ride for the FU's on that one.

739
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:16,860
Alright. I'm looking forward to it.

740
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:17,860
Alright.

741
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:23,860
I kind of didn't get to talk enough about the whole vanilla ninja coincidence there within the groove and stuff.

742
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:26,860
Are you afraid of the backlash that might be coming?

743
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:28,860
I don't know, kind of hard to say, I mean...

744
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:30,860
Because you know there's going to be critics out there.

745
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:34,860
I mean, you already kind of know that with the step data,

746
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:37,860
that's the first thing people always complain about with the new DDR makes is the steps.

747
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:40,860
Somebody will not like the steps, that's just a given.

748
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:44,860
But now you've got the fact that now people have something they're going to keep comparing it to,

749
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:46,860
and it's kind of like, ugh.

750
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:50,860
I didn't like the competition stepped out of very much.

751
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:53,860
And I'm not saying that as a biased opinion.

752
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:59,980
And I got more or less a lot of confidence in the people who I know who did the step

753
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:02,240
data for UltraMix 2.

754
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:10,340
But in the groove, I mean, obviously that's where it came from, obviously.

755
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:14,380
Almost half of it was what you would expect already, but they have a knack for throwing

756
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:18,180
in odd rhythms for no reason.

757
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:22,020
You just kind of wonder if they're listening to the same song you are, but that's just

758
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:25,860
hopefully it's not the same edit oh no no not all trust like I said if I can

759
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:31,060
say ours is better obviously ours is different okay and you know I mean I

760
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:34,780
have to you know personally you know back it up because I did do some of the

761
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:39,820
step data for us some of the modes I think it's it's interesting more than

762
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:42,860
anything else that you know you're gonna have the same song in two different

763
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:46,580
games two different cuts and two different sets of steps very interesting

764
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:51,780
to see the differences there at least yours isn't gonna have mines right

765
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:59,780
Oh God, no. And for the record, I saw Miklatov make a comment about all the girls looking like men.

766
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:03,780
No, they don't. Only the one girl who has the bad 70s Abba hair.

767
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:07,780
Only, you know, her bangs kind of throw her off, but she cleaned up since.

768
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:12,780
And they still have that one girl, the youngest girl, who looks like Pornakova.

769
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:17,780
Anything that looks like Pornakova is good to me.

770
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:22,980
Wow. Okay. We're going to open up the Skype line in a little bit. If you guys have anything

771
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:28,800
you want to ask about for UltraMix 2, as well as, oh God, what else? I mean, this is a big

772
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:32,900
week, Bomani game-wise. I mean, this is the calm before the storm, because in this week

773
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:38,220
we're about ready to hit the unofficial Bomani holidays of 19 November and 20 November, and

774
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:44,900
now this year, this year we have 18 November, which is going to be the big day that 8 style

775
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:49,420
consumer versions out, Popin Music 10 is out, and DDR Festival is all going to come out.

776
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:55,620
And now we find out UltraMix 2 got pushed back to an 18 November ship day. So the Americans

777
00:52:55,620 --> 00:53:00,300
get in on it too a little bit. So it's going to be a very big week. So this week's show,

778
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:04,100
this next week's show is going to be huge. Tonight we're just mediocre, but next week

779
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:05,100
huge. No, anyway.

780
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:07,060
This is an orgy waiting to happen.

781
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:10,420
All right, we do have a call coming in on the Skype line. Let me take this real fast.

782
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:13,220
I do want to get to that announcement too, I keep forgetting. But let's get to this call

783
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:14,740
first real fast. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge.

784
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:21,940
yo sky hi here who's this Ziggy hi Ziggy how you doing hey nothing much

785
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:30,700
what's on your mind well I only have a one question for a for a guy what walk

786
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:38,540
yeah for a little walk okay yeah yeah I just you know I just read this from

787
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:44,300
the money style that DJ about last Tuesday DJ paranoia posted that Jason

788
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:49,420
Because Enos is wanting to bring out 2DX in the U.S.

789
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:51,380
What is your reaction about that?

790
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:57,100
Well obviously, I mean, who in the Bimani community would not want to see 2DX in America?

791
00:53:57,100 --> 00:54:03,940
I mean, there's no doubt that there has been enough music games within the past three to

792
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:07,860
four years to warrant that obviously, well yeah, you know, we can probably take it one

793
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:12,060
step further, but I mean, there's a lot of things you have to consider when you want

794
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:16,500
to bring a game like 2DX that's established in one country to another. Like, for example,

795
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:21,080
you have like 11 styles in Japan. So, you know, it's, everyone knows what they want,

796
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:25,340
are going to expect. However, if you bring it out here to America, well, you got to think,

797
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:29,860
well, how much are people going to pay for a peripheral to a game that is completely

798
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:32,940
absolutely new? You're not sure about that. Then you got to think.

799
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:36,980
Well, but maybe, maybe the success of games like Donkey Konga and hopefully Taco Drum

800
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:38,980
Master, maybe that would be incentive, hopefully.

801
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:39,980
Okay, that's true.

802
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:40,980
Maybe.

803
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:44,420
Let's take it one step further.

804
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:48,260
You got people, like I said, Bimani fans who would like to see a US version, they probably

805
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:49,260
would want to buy it.

806
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:54,260
That said, how difficult do you make it on the get-go?

807
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:57,020
Do you want to make it easy enough for people to get it?

808
00:54:57,020 --> 00:55:01,140
Truth be told, 2DX is not an easy Bimani.

809
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:05,900
When you compare the major four, for example, I would say 2DX, if you take the hardest song

810
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:09,580
from DDR compared to like the hardest song guitar freaks to like you know 2DX

811
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:13,460
and 2DX is a pretty difficult game I mean you know I mean of course it can be beat

812
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:17,300
within reasonable time and such but then you gotta think you know it's like well

813
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:20,380
are we gonna have a beginner mode for us are we only going to make it up to like

814
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:23,620
you know the hardest song is maybe just the normal seven is there gonna be a

815
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:28,560
flashing seven you gotta wonder about like being able to appease new fans but

816
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:31,680
at the same time you don't want to insult the intelligence of like the

817
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:37,600
Yeah, of the hardcore people, so it's kind of a hard, I think, I mean, just coming from

818
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:41,600
me, I think that would be a little bit of a hard thing to gauge, I mean, I don't think

819
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:45,820
it's impossible, and I mean, like anyone, I would like to see it come over, whether

820
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:47,600
it will or not, I mean, you never know.

821
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:53,840
I mean, obviously, with the success Biamani has been having, it's making a case stronger

822
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:57,040
and stronger each day, so whenever it happens, you know.

823
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:00,260
From your perspective, having been on the inside at one point, is there anything you

824
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:02,260
Do you think we could do as Bimani fans to help?

825
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:04,980
Like are petitions going to help or is it a lost cause or what?

826
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:05,980
Well, I don't know.

827
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:10,780
I have really yet to see a petition really, you know, like make a difference in anything.

828
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:11,780
Right.

829
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:15,780
You know, I mean, last time I ever saw that was quite a recall, but you know, that's a

830
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:17,980
whole different story altogether.

831
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:23,560
But I think it's more or less, you really just got to support Bimani and you just got

832
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:27,420
to, I mean, it doesn't hurt to drop a letter into customer service once in a while to Konami

833
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:30,060
and say, yeah, we're really interested in all that kind of stuff.

834
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:51,060
I mean, sure, when you write it off and send it off, you think no one's ever going to pay attention, but you'd be surprised when, like, you know, as a product manager, I notice for like any video game, you always gotta keep your eyes and ears open because, you know, just like the slightest bit of, you know, idea or just, you know, hints or suggestions people have, you know, fans have a lot more influence than they think.

835
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:56,060
Obviously they're not going to make the game all by themselves, but I think you have to

836
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:57,060
figure that kind of stuff.

837
00:56:57,060 --> 00:57:00,380
I mean, if you want to have a successful game, you want people to buy it, you give them what

838
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:02,820
they want, by and far.

839
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:04,380
Very interesting.

840
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:05,380
Very cool.

841
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:08,060
Siggy, anything else you want to ask for 4.1?

842
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:10,540
No, that's the only other question I wanted to know.

843
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:11,540
Okay, cool.

844
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:15,060
Hey, you looking forward to 8 style consumer?

845
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:16,060
Yeah.

846
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:18,420
Alright, call us back next week and let us know what you think, because I'm too poor

847
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:20,260
to get it, so I don't know if we're going to get to look at it.

848
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:26,640
Thanks guys. Alright, take it easy man. Alright. Bye bye. Very good question. I did not know

849
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:31,100
that that kind of stuff was posted over on BemaniStyle, but that's what I get for not

850
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:38,020
being in the loop on the different forums. Interesting. Alright, let's get to that big

851
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:41,960
announcement while we wait for another call to come in. One interesting thing that was

852
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:46,180
brought up on the show last week is that, is there a possibility that in the future

853
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:50,040
that Orange Lounge Radio and DDR Freak Radio might get together and do something? And the

854
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:57,400
answer is yes starting this Friday on what is the date this Friday Friday the

855
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:01,560
19th starting this Friday you'll be able to catch the orange lounge radio rewind

856
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:05,960
over on DDR freak radio that's the big announcement and if you've been paying

857
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:09,840
attention to DDR freaks site feedback forum you'd already know that because it

858
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:14,480
was announced earlier today but that's alright so maybe but maybe you want to

859
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:18,120
go over to that forum and let them know what great news it is to hear that we're

860
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:21,700
gonna be doing that so hopefully we'll be able to have a guana girl on the show

861
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:24,700
again and do more kinds of things to partner up with DDR Freak Radio and let

862
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:28,480
them know that there's lots of love for internet radio stations there's there's

863
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:32,660
plenty of love for all of us so so that's exciting I'm really excited I

864
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:36,000
think it'll help open up our show to a whole new audience over there and I

865
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:40,940
think it's gonna bring their radio station something different I don't know

866
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:43,720
if it's gonna work out good for them because our show kind of sucks but you

867
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:45,420
No, I'm kidding.

868
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:48,220
Our show rocks, listen to it every week.

869
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:49,480
What, Lanky's down?

870
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:52,820
I said, yeah, you've got self-confidence.

871
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:55,720
Let me put it this way, if I wasn't confident in this show,

872
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:57,760
I would have stopped on episode three or four.

873
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:02,520
This is 117, or 118 now.

874
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:05,520
Yeah, how long were you playing DDR?

875
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:06,720
Shut up.

876
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:09,800
All right, how long were you playing DDR?

877
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:10,520
Excuse me?

878
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:11,040
Yeah.

879
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:13,160
Who was in Sacramento that, yeah, that's what I thought.

880
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:14,160
Yeah, shut up.

881
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:15,160
Well, yeah.

882
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:16,160
Yeah.

883
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:17,160
Uh-huh.

884
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:18,160
1999.

885
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:21,800
How are you doing over there, Darkstackeler, by the way?

886
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:23,800
I haven't heard a lot from you tonight, which is rare.

887
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:25,480
I hate my nose.

888
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:26,480
Aww.

889
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,040
So does Michael Jackson.

890
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:31,320
Yeah, but he had the money to go buy him a new one.

891
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:33,920
I need one that comes with completely dry sinuses.

892
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:36,240
Yeah, you just need new sinuses, though.

893
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:37,240
Yeah.

894
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,240
Your nose is fine.

895
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,240
I'm getting high off of this Vicks stuff, though.

896
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:41,240
Awesome.

897
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:49,400
I'm doing my homework, so yeah, I'm doing a homework on ethics and business and contracts.

898
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:50,400
It's very boring.

899
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:51,400
Fascinating.

900
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:52,400
Very, very fascinating.

901
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:53,400
Oh.

902
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:57,280
By fascinating you mean boring, yes, it is.

903
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:01,720
To answer some questions from the chat room about the whole DDR Freak Radio syndication,

904
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:05,680
it's going to be 6 p.m. Pacific Time on Friday.

905
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:06,680
That's awesome.

906
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:07,680
On DDR Freak Radio.

907
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:08,680
I'll be at work.

908
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:10,880
Well, tune in from work.

909
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:12,680
I don't know what to tell you.

910
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:13,680
No, that's a good idea.

911
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:14,480
I have to try that.

912
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:15,320
You should try that.

913
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:16,440
There you go.

914
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:19,280
And just so you know, the Wednesday rewinds here

915
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:22,000
on Orange Lounge Radio, they're going to change a little bit.

916
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,200
Since we have our rewinds over on DDR Free Radio now,

917
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:27,320
we're going to bring you classic and moldy episodes of Orange

918
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:30,880
Lounge Radio that are freshly fermented.

919
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:32,680
So year-old episodes we're going to start

920
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:36,340
bringing you on Wednesday nights, like old stuff.

921
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:37,840
That'll be the little change there.

922
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:39,160
Oh, we are getting another call.

923
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:41,160
I need to pay attention to the Skype line once in a while.

924
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:45,160
Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

925
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:47,160
Well, Legend of Zaku here.

926
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:49,160
Hi Zaku, how you doing?

927
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:55,160
Yeah, let me add a counter statement to what they said about American 2DX release.

928
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:56,160
Okay.

929
01:00:56,160 --> 01:01:04,160
Seeing as, you know, going on the basis of the last presidential election and the fact that most,

930
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:09,860
The vast majority of this country is red and I want to follow up on that word just to keep

931
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:10,860
it there.

932
01:01:10,860 --> 01:01:11,860
Wait, wait.

933
01:01:11,860 --> 01:01:14,320
Wouldn't that mean that 2DX Red might have some success here?

934
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:16,320
No, I didn't mean that.

935
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:21,080
What I meant is the red states, in particular the fact that you're releasing a seven key

936
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:26,960
game with a turntable and the fact that it's going really fast and it's going to, you know,

937
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:32,520
I don't know if we're prepared for the attention span that it will, because that will demand

938
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:39,120
a lot. Especially from Americans who are... Alright, Mel's got his hand up. Mel's got

939
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:45,400
his hand up. And I suppose that's why Omaha, of all places, got 2DX Red before everyone

940
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:51,840
else in America, whom? Hey, I live in New York. Hey, I live in New York. My state has

941
01:01:51,840 --> 01:02:01,720
a nice style. It's only a nice style on the East Coast. I'm sorry, were you saying something?

942
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:07,720
Let me put it this way. I don't know if 2DX will sell here.

943
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:16,720
Let me sum it up. You're saying that basically, and you're tangent to the election aside, ignoring all that,

944
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:19,720
basically what you're saying in a nutshell is that America is too stupid for 2DX.

945
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:22,720
I don't know. Maybe. I'm not sure.

946
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:26,720
What you're mainly saying is that people who vote for somebody you don't agree with are stupid.

947
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:32,240
stupid. No, we all know that. You're misunderstanding my point. You're misunderstanding me right

948
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:40,680
now. Look, listen. What I'm trying to say is that in a video game country, in a country

949
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:45,400
where basically the vast majority of video games are like what? Right now it's mostly

950
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:54,400
you know, Halo. It's like first person shooting sports and fighting games. Dancing games is

951
01:02:54,400 --> 01:03:00,880
up there and make some highlights and a few and took the limelight a little bit, but you're

952
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:07,360
talking about something that, I don't know, the same way that DDR supposedly came here

953
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:14,520
because it didn't plan this to arrive because it only came with a few thousand copies thinking

954
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:18,120
that it wasn't going to sell because of the cultural differences. That's what I'm trying

955
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:19,120
to say.

956
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:21,780
Okay, you know what, that sounds very familiar.

957
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:26,760
You actually sound like the president of Konami around circa 2000.

958
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:32,800
This is when Jason Neils had fought for about three years to get DDR in America.

959
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:37,000
Somehow Jason had begged and clotted and did everything in his power to get DDR released

960
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,340
into America.

961
01:03:38,340 --> 01:03:42,720
The president only made them press about 20,000 copies or so.

962
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:47,200
He was absolutely confident this would not sell, it would not do well in America.

963
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:53,200
And, you know, lo and behold, when it did come out to America, it sold out, like, at a record pace.

964
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:57,700
You try to go to Fry's or any other place that sold video games, there was no way in hell you could find a copy.

965
01:03:57,700 --> 01:04:02,200
People had to pay, like, 70 or 80 dollars for a PS1 freaking game, you know, for crying out loud.

966
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:05,000
And that's not even counting the ones with, like, a bundle, so...

967
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:10,900
And remember, this was at a time when music games did not have nearly as much fanfare as it does now.

968
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:16,000
I mean, now that not only do you have Konami, but, you know, you had, like, people from Harmonix that did frequency amplitude.

969
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,780
now you know karaoke revolution that you got the MTV you know so I'm just saying

970
01:04:19,780 --> 01:04:25,260
you know I mean it's a legitimate idea to say that you know b2dx might not sell

971
01:04:25,260 --> 01:04:29,140
well that may be true you know it's like I wouldn't put it so it's you know for

972
01:04:29,140 --> 01:04:33,020
the fact that people are too stupid for it let let me let that go finish the

973
01:04:33,020 --> 01:04:38,060
stock basically I can understand that there's only I can't understand why

974
01:04:38,060 --> 01:04:42,880
there's only two bemon two forms of Armani here GDR and karaoke revolution

975
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:48,880
Adding a third and trying to expand gradually from what's already there in Japan, I'm not sure.

976
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:55,880
I know both did well. In a sense, it might be a slippery slope on one side,

977
01:04:55,880 --> 01:05:02,880
but as long as fans can back it up and regular people can learn how to be tolerant and embrace it,

978
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:06,880
then there's a good chance it'll sell and make a repeat of the last two.

979
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:09,880
Alright, the bottom line is, if it came out, you'd buy it, right?

980
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:10,880
I would buy it, no doubt.

981
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:12,880
There you go. At least the support would be there.

982
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:16,880
Alright, we gotta move on. So thank you for calling, Zaku. Have a good one.

983
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:18,880
I just want to make a really quick comment.

984
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:19,880
Very interesting perspective.

985
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:26,880
I want to make a really quick comment. A lot of games in Japan never come here because people think we're not gonna get it.

986
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:30,880
There's just too many cultural differences. Look at games like Katamari Damacy.

987
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:32,880
I was just thinking the same thing as you were saying that.

988
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:34,880
Animal Crossing.

989
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:43,880
Katamari Damacy, Incredible Crisis didn't sell incredibly, but it was pretty tough to find.

990
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:44,880
It had a following.

991
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:46,880
I mean, the little amount of copies they...

992
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:47,880
Even Bust A Move.

993
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:53,880
Yeah, Bust A Move. That was like right around the same time DDR first came out, when the first Bust A Move game came out.

994
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:58,880
The first Bust A Move had been out. I had the second one before the first one came out.

995
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:26,880
And essentially, like, all that stuff becomes cult hit. I mean, like, Parappa was, you know, first Japan, if I'm not mistaken, or whatever, and then, yeah, it came out here, and it sold about, like, 30-40,000 units, which, essentially, in the game industry, 25,000 is considered, like, a cult hit, so, you know, and, just like DDR, the minute you get a cult following, you know, if it has, if the game is good enough and has staying power, and you have enough fans that back it, it's gonna blow up eventually, you know, it will run its course.

996
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:31,200
I mean, and it's just, that's usually how they all start, whenever something new comes

997
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:34,040
out it's a quote-unquote cult hit.

998
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:38,880
I mean, this is, maybe people are going to probably bash me for saying this, but first

999
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:42,160
person shooters didn't used to be the most popular game in the world.

1000
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:47,240
But then ever since, you know, Doom came out, just, it started going, getting more and more

1001
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:51,880
popular and then, and then we got, then we got, then we got Goldeneye, and then.

1002
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:54,600
But first person shooters weren't really possible before Doom.

1003
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:56,200
No, no, yes they were.

1004
01:06:56,200 --> 01:07:02,200
there were games before Doom, I played them before. They were 3D technically, but they

1005
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:03,440
were first responders.

1006
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:07,800
I think, you know what though, Zaku does bring up an interesting perspective. I think what

1007
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:13,500
basically he's saying and how Mel makes the comparison where, you know, this was the same

1008
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:17,920
reservation as the Konami had about DDR several years ago, is that people wouldn't get it.

1009
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:20,520
Well, they're just having those same concerns all over again. I don't think that comes as

1010
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:23,200
a surprise to any of us, basically, so, you know.

1011
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:27,560
I think with a good marketing campaign, I think it would definitely move.

1012
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:32,400
I think a lot of it has to do with what is 2DX's niche, too?

1013
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:35,800
DDR makes you lose your butt a little bit, right?

1014
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:36,800
It makes you work out.

1015
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:38,880
And then 2DX is just fans of music.

1016
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:42,560
People who like the feeling that they're creating a song, but with no talent.

1017
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:43,560
No, just kidding.

1018
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:44,560
I'm just kidding.

1019
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:45,560
I'm just kidding.

1020
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:49,320
There's a lot of people out there who play 2DX that are extremely talented, but it's

1021
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:55,360
easier to make the music, you could say, playing 2DX than actually going and producing music

1022
01:07:55,360 --> 01:08:00,520
from the ground up. And everybody, I think, gets that feeling. I remember the first time

1023
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:05,360
I ever played Hip Hop Mania, Complete Mix 1, when it first came out in America, way

1024
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:10,280
back in the day, and I played, you know, was it Believe Again or something like really

1025
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:14,720
old, I was just like, I feel like I'm making music. I pressed a key, and then I pressed

1026
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:21,060
the key again and this turntable is cool. You know, I love music. I've grown up loving

1027
01:08:21,060 --> 01:08:27,180
music and I still love music. Obviously a lot of people love music, so I think you just

1028
01:08:27,180 --> 01:08:32,860
point at these things in a sales campaign or something and sell it off of its music.

1029
01:08:32,860 --> 01:08:36,500
Well I just kind of hope that the success of Donkey Kongo, which I believe has been

1030
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:42,020
a fairly successful game so far, Taiko Drum Master, not Taiko no Tatujin of Japan, a little

1031
01:08:42,020 --> 01:08:45,860
early to tell I think of that one so far if it's been successful or not but hopefully

1032
01:08:45,860 --> 01:08:50,940
if these games that come bundled with peripherals are somewhat successful hopefully maybe Konami

1033
01:08:50,940 --> 01:08:55,080
will go okay maybe maybe maybe maybe America feels a little different about peripherals

1034
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:59,420
now because I think a long time ago it was kind of like peripherals don't do well here

1035
01:08:59,420 --> 01:09:06,440
super scope power pad you know everything pretty much tank u-force power glove well

1036
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:11,260
how much is a how much is a like an official Konami dance pad right now still about I don't

1037
01:09:11,260 --> 01:09:15,260
I mean, to get an official Konami pad, you'd have to buy a bundle, usually.

1038
01:09:15,260 --> 01:09:20,260
I mean, if you go to, like, some, like, Starlax 8 Toys and Joys, yeah, you can probably get for, like, 30, 40 bucks.

1039
01:09:20,260 --> 01:09:24,260
But the bundle, I think they run about somewhere around $79 to $80, give or take.

1040
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:29,260
I believe they are selling an UltraMix 2 bundle on Amazon right now for $59.99.

1041
01:09:29,260 --> 01:09:37,260
Okay, so, what I'm saying is that when the Konami pads officially came out originally, they were over $50 apiece.

1042
01:09:37,260 --> 01:09:39,380
they were over fifty bucks a piece

1043
01:09:39,380 --> 01:09:42,500
to import them before they came out here they were usually like seventy

1044
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:44,220
something bucks a piece

1045
01:09:44,220 --> 01:09:46,540
obviously the prices dropped

1046
01:09:46,540 --> 01:09:47,400
substantially

1047
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:51,220
well mad cats had a lot to do with that too with their you know bargain basement

1048
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:54,700
dance pads well no i'm talking about official pads that are actually

1049
01:09:54,700 --> 01:09:57,680
quality made pads

1050
01:09:57,680 --> 01:10:01,520
you know i think the same could be done with a konami controller i mean

1051
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:03,320
ever since the 2DX

1052
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:05,820
official konami controller not the arcade style

1053
01:10:05,820 --> 01:10:08,340
ever since they came out they've been around a hundred dollars

1054
01:10:08,340 --> 01:10:10,700
and they still are around a hundred dollars

1055
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:12,420
i'm sure they could

1056
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:15,180
work something out where they could drop the price a little bit for an american

1057
01:10:15,180 --> 01:10:16,540
you know release

1058
01:10:16,540 --> 01:10:20,820
sony does it all the time they take big you know maybe uh... konami could outsource

1059
01:10:20,820 --> 01:10:22,840
a company to make a quality

1060
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:23,980
controller

1061
01:10:23,980 --> 01:10:25,480
you know interesting

1062
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:28,400
you know and take and take a little bit of loss for a little while till the game

1063
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:30,460
gets you know who knows maybe

1064
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:33,040
sony makes peripherals why can't sony do it

1065
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:34,500
they got money

1066
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:37,860
So in other words, Konami, if you're listening, just take a chance.

1067
01:10:37,860 --> 01:10:43,220
Oh my god. Take a chance on me. No, stop it. Take a chance. No ABBA. Take a chance. Is there ABBA in DDR?

1068
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:47,780
Or in anybody? Not yet, not yet. Then don't bring it up.

1069
01:10:47,780 --> 01:10:49,940
Dancing quick.

1070
01:10:49,940 --> 01:10:53,420
As long as ASCII does not make a seven key,

1071
01:10:53,420 --> 01:10:56,140
ASCII is probably the worst five key

1072
01:10:56,140 --> 01:10:59,660
controller ever made. Wait, is that the same company that made the ASCII

1073
01:10:59,660 --> 01:11:02,020
pad for the Super Nintendo?

1074
01:11:02,020 --> 01:11:07,940
That was, I think, at the time, the greatest controller ever made, so what the fuck happened

1075
01:11:07,940 --> 01:11:08,940
to them?

1076
01:11:08,940 --> 01:11:09,940
Management.

1077
01:11:09,940 --> 01:11:10,940
I don't know.

1078
01:11:10,940 --> 01:11:11,940
All right.

1079
01:11:11,940 --> 01:11:12,940
Maybe.

1080
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:13,940
All right, we're going to go to a break.

1081
01:11:13,940 --> 01:11:16,140
We got some more UltraMix II songs we're going to play for you guys.

1082
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:18,780
This next one, it's actually a really long one, so we're going to kind of shorten it

1083
01:11:18,780 --> 01:11:19,780
a little bit.

1084
01:11:19,780 --> 01:11:21,420
I'm going to kind of start it here in the middle for you guys.

1085
01:11:21,420 --> 01:11:23,500
It's a group called Creo.

1086
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:24,980
I think I pronounced that right.

1087
01:11:24,980 --> 01:11:25,980
Creo?

1088
01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:26,980
Close enough.

1089
01:11:26,980 --> 01:11:27,980
Close enough.

1090
01:11:27,980 --> 01:11:28,980
It's K-R-E-O.

1091
01:11:28,980 --> 01:11:29,980
Creo.

1092
01:11:29,980 --> 01:11:30,980
Or if you said it backwards, it would be O-REK.

1093
01:11:30,980 --> 01:11:31,980
I don't know.

1094
01:11:31,980 --> 01:11:36,580
Anyway, the song is called Burn For You, and this is a new song that's going to be on Ultramix

1095
01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:37,580
too.

1096
01:11:37,580 --> 01:11:40,220
And don't play this at your local clinic.

1097
01:11:40,220 --> 01:11:41,580
It might be a bad sign.

1098
01:11:41,580 --> 01:11:42,920
All right, here it is.

1099
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:43,420
Enjoy.

1100
01:11:43,420 --> 01:12:12,420
You need to get something you don't know You need to get something you don't know

1101
01:12:12,420 --> 01:12:23,420
Let me tell you somethin' you don't know

1102
01:12:23,420 --> 01:12:52,420
If you keep the secret, I will know If you keep the secret, I will know

1103
01:12:52,420 --> 01:12:54,420
I'm learning from you

1104
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:02,420
I'm learning from you

1105
01:13:32,420 --> 01:13:54,740
Let me tell you somethin' you don't know Let me tell you somethin' you don't know

1106
01:13:54,740 --> 01:14:18,880
Should you keep the secrets I once told

1107
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:23,880
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na

1108
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:25,880
I'm burning for you

1109
01:14:41,380 --> 01:14:43,880
Let me tell you something

1110
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:45,880
You don't know

1111
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:47,880
I'm burning for you

1112
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:47,880
Oh

1113
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:25,880
And there you go again.

1114
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:37,880
To the steps wide to orange path.

1115
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:39,880
This GDR sucks.

1116
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:57,120
We are back here on Orange Launch Radio, starting the Eurobeat party apparently, no sorry about

1117
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:58,120
that.

1118
01:16:58,120 --> 01:17:01,080
That's what happens when I have things on repeat, it shouldn't be.

1119
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:07,680
Initial D. Initial D. We are back here on episode number 118, what are you boys talking

1120
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:08,680
about over there?

1121
01:17:08,680 --> 01:17:10,680
What are you always talking about back there?

1122
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:12,680
Oh, we're gushing over the Rumble Roses soundtrack.

1123
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:14,680
Oh, you're right. We're talking about boobs.

1124
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:18,680
Well, it's kind of relevant because the game comes out this week here, so...

1125
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:20,680
I thought it just came out on, like, Friday or something.

1126
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:21,680
Did it?

1127
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:22,680
Yeah, I heard it came out.

1128
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:26,680
Okay. Well, I just know that this week I've got to go pick up a few games, so...

1129
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:28,680
Am I coming through on the mic?

1130
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:29,680
Do you have money for that?

1131
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:31,680
Yeah, I got a little money.

1132
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:32,680
Just teasing you.

1133
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:34,680
Can you check the levels? Am I coming through?

1134
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:36,680
Yeah, you're coming through. I can hear you.

1135
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:40,880
That's why I have these big space-age headphones on, so I can hear that the microphones are coming through okay.

1136
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:42,380
Yeah, now you look like a real DJ.

1137
01:17:42,380 --> 01:17:45,280
Yeah, I know. This is the coolestest I'm ever going to get to the real thing.

1138
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:46,980
I mean, you've got the headphones on.

1139
01:17:46,980 --> 01:17:47,780
I know.

1140
01:17:47,780 --> 01:17:49,680
You're not particularly attractive.

1141
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:50,080
I got two-

1142
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:51,780
Just kidding!

1143
01:17:51,780 --> 01:17:53,380
I got two turntables and a microphone.

1144
01:17:53,380 --> 01:17:54,980
Aha! Okay, Beck.

1145
01:17:54,980 --> 01:17:55,680
All right.

1146
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:57,380
Where's that, huh?

1147
01:17:57,380 --> 01:17:59,680
Um, no, but...

1148
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:02,680
But... continue. Onto your topic, if you have one.

1149
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:05,580
Well, I was going to say Rumble Roses, but that's all right. If you guys are done-

1150
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:08,580
You were talking to Mel about the voice acting, right?

1151
01:18:08,580 --> 01:18:13,580
Oh yeah, I was just asking if I ever asked him about the voice acting, if there was anything up with it.

1152
01:18:13,580 --> 01:18:16,580
I mentioned it last week, but I couldn't remember it quite like you can.

1153
01:18:16,580 --> 01:18:21,580
Okay. Well, no, I just was explaining to him, and I'm assuming it's not the game itself.

1154
01:18:21,580 --> 01:18:27,580
The game, I doubt could normally release a game with seriously mismatched speech to the lip syncing,

1155
01:18:27,580 --> 01:18:32,580
because it was like, in the videos I had, the voices were coming out of the wrong people.

1156
01:18:32,580 --> 01:18:38,580
So I'm assuming it's just because somebody was skipping, whoever was playing over at IGN was skipping through dialogue in it, you know.

1157
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:41,080
You know how it is.

1158
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:45,420
And by the way, don't blame us people over at the...

1159
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:51,960
in the U.S. for the horrible dialogue within the game. We were only given one day to rewrite all that stuff, so...

1160
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:58,760
Even the producer admitted as much after we did, like, you know, some damage control. He said we should have been writing from the get-go.

1161
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:04,760
You know what's interesting, though, is that a lot of the earlier reviews of Rumble Roses have good things to say about the music. Very good things to say about the music.

1162
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:09,760
Oh, a lot of people I've been reading the reviews have been saying it's just a good game all around.

1163
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:15,760
I mean, I think, you know, the chicks thing has a big thing to do with that, but hey, it looks like a great game.

1164
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:22,760
Well, I think what Rumble Roses has best going for it is the fact that, I mean, you capture a lot of things that wrestling people like.

1165
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:31,760
They like wrestling, and most of the wrestling, they use the engine from Yuke's, which was the one that's been used for Smackdown for the past couple of seasons.

1166
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:36,760
So the people who buy the game have something they're already familiar with as far as gameplay.

1167
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:42,760
And then of course it's, you know, 100,000 megapixels or whatever, you know.

1168
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:49,760
So the characters are very detailed and, you know, they've got an engine for jiggling and all that kind of stuff, I'm thinking, you know.

1169
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:58,760
So it's, I mean, what's not to like? Visually great? Gameplay great? I mean, if you don't like, if you don't like wrestling, I mean, then...

1170
01:19:58,760 --> 01:20:02,760
Well, wait a minute, that's the weird thing. I don't like chicks, and I don't like wrestling, yet I'm interested in this game.

1171
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:08,760
Okay, wait, wait, wait, that's because you're, that's because you're gay. And?

1172
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:13,760
No, no, no, that's the reason why you're interested, because you wish you could be as hot as these girls.

1173
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:15,760
Okay, yeah, I wish.

1174
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:17,760
Anyway, no, um...

1175
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:20,760
Yeah, blanket statement aside, anyway, um...

1176
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:25,760
Here's just kind of an old joke, but on a serious note, kind of, I don't know.

1177
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:27,760
Well, no, not any serious, just a joke.

1178
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:30,760
Yeah, it's got the whole engine for jiggling and stuff.

1179
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:34,760
You're not necessarily a boob guy, which you're weird if you aren't,

1180
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:36,760
but you're more of an ass guy.

1181
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:38,760
They got some pretty good accurate ass jiggling, too.

1182
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:42,760
I would say I'm more of an ass guy, and I still don't care.

1183
01:20:42,760 --> 01:20:49,360
And again, you're gay.

1184
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:50,360
What the hell?

1185
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:51,360
What are you saying Miklo?

1186
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:52,360
You saying I'm wrong?

1187
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:54,360
What am I wrong about?

1188
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:55,360
Anyway.

1189
01:20:55,360 --> 01:21:01,700
So anyway, about the voice of reason, one of our females in the chatroom, DDR Coholic

1190
01:21:01,700 --> 01:21:04,600
says when will the games with the gyrating penis come out?

1191
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:07,880
I want to know when my thunder down under wrestling game comes out.

1192
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:12,880
If you want giant gyrating penis, that would have been in Katamari Damacy.

1193
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:13,880
Yeah.

1194
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:14,880
Yeah.

1195
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:20,880
Actually, no, there's a series of games in Japan that are shooters, that all the characters,

1196
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:21,880
shooter games.

1197
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:27,880
Floyd Walker's grabbing his testicles, like, he's like, oh no, okay.

1198
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:34,880
No, not that kind of, like a side-scrolling shooter game, that are, the characters, your

1199
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:39,740
your ship, whatever, is like a muscly, half-naked man.

1200
01:21:39,740 --> 01:21:41,780
And this is like a big popular series in Japan.

1201
01:21:41,780 --> 01:21:44,220
Like, it was on, if you search for, like, weirdest Japanese

1202
01:21:44,220 --> 01:21:47,020
games on Google, I'm sure you'll find a link to it.

1203
01:21:47,020 --> 01:21:48,260
So you know what?

1204
01:21:48,260 --> 01:21:49,620
There are plenty of games.

1205
01:21:49,620 --> 01:21:52,380
That's from Miklotov.

1206
01:21:52,380 --> 01:21:54,780
OK, Skydish Kimborn punched me.

1207
01:21:54,780 --> 01:21:56,380
Thanks a lot, Miklotov.

1208
01:21:56,380 --> 01:22:01,940
He says, because not all gay guys want to be women.

1209
01:22:01,940 --> 01:22:02,340
I know.

1210
01:22:02,340 --> 01:22:03,940
I said, blanket statement aside.

1211
01:22:03,940 --> 01:22:07,940
Obviously, I wasn't serious, but I am with you, Miklotov.

1212
01:22:07,940 --> 01:22:09,860
No, I'm just kidding.

1213
01:22:09,860 --> 01:22:11,900
It was fun to punch you anyway.

1214
01:22:11,900 --> 01:22:12,400
You know.

1215
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:15,700
God, do not bring a boonga boonga.

1216
01:22:15,700 --> 01:22:20,260
We do not need finger to the ass action here.

1217
01:22:20,260 --> 01:22:21,460
Oh, man.

1218
01:22:21,460 --> 01:22:22,860
Not that kind of ass.

1219
01:22:22,860 --> 01:22:25,900
Anyway, I just thought I'd let you know,

1220
01:22:25,900 --> 01:22:27,660
because girls always say this.

1221
01:22:27,660 --> 01:22:30,420
When do we do the hot guys in games?

1222
01:22:30,420 --> 01:22:34,580
Hot guys in games has been around since games came out, okay?

1223
01:22:34,580 --> 01:22:38,260
They've been putting artwork on old arcade games with big, muscly men, and they still

1224
01:22:38,260 --> 01:22:41,180
put hot guys, quote-unquote, in video games now.

1225
01:22:41,180 --> 01:22:42,180
Like Karnov?

1226
01:22:42,180 --> 01:22:43,180
What's that?

1227
01:22:43,180 --> 01:22:44,180
What?

1228
01:22:44,180 --> 01:22:45,180
What?

1229
01:22:45,180 --> 01:22:46,180
I can play with John Cena at home, so I'm happy.

1230
01:22:46,180 --> 01:22:47,660
I don't know who John Cena is.

1231
01:22:47,660 --> 01:22:48,660
How about this is a weird...

1232
01:22:48,660 --> 01:22:49,660
Oh, okay.

1233
01:22:49,660 --> 01:22:50,660
Hey, hey, hey.

1234
01:22:50,660 --> 01:22:52,460
How about this is a weird game right here?

1235
01:22:52,460 --> 01:22:54,460
Mini Skirt Police.

1236
01:22:54,460 --> 01:22:59,300
Wait, did you suffer weird games, like, people?

1237
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:00,300
Yeah.

1238
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:06,300
Miniskirt Police. It's a light gun game. Or I guess you take pictures of women in miniskirts.

1239
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:07,300
Okay.

1240
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:09,300
Not from Namco thing. Go Namco.

1241
01:23:09,300 --> 01:23:13,300
Oh yeah. There's Namco for it. Interesting.

1242
01:23:13,300 --> 01:23:19,300
They should have a motion capture version of that. MoCap miniskirt police.

1243
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:26,300
And you need a partner to play with in a miniskirt. So it's not really a game. It's just, yeah. Anyway.

1244
01:23:26,300 --> 01:23:31,300
Hey, don't like the Japanese games, though, because they brought us Radiant Silver Gun, which I've got to play for the game.

1245
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:34,300
And an awesome spin-off called Ikaruga.

1246
01:23:34,300 --> 01:23:39,300
Yeah, but I got to play Radiant Silver Gun Arcade Machine, and that makes me feel special for the rest of my life.

1247
01:23:39,300 --> 01:23:44,300
On the now-vanished game land in Vegas.

1248
01:23:44,300 --> 01:23:48,300
Ooh, cool. Radiant Silver Gun is pretty. Okay.

1249
01:23:48,300 --> 01:23:49,300
Nice.

1250
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:50,300
Go on, Rob.

1251
01:23:50,300 --> 01:23:56,300
Oh hell, did I have another topic? I knew I had something Ultramix 2 related. I want to get to the cage match soon too, but I guess we can do one more quick topic.

1252
01:23:56,300 --> 01:24:05,300
You know that some of the first early reviews of Ultramix 2 came out, and one of them has been making rounds on The Freak. It's the one that was in GMR magazine.

1253
01:24:05,300 --> 01:24:18,300
And apparently, they're not big fans of the game. But man, The Freak, they are tearing this guy apart. Like, I was just reading this. I'm looking at the thread here, page 160.

1254
01:24:18,300 --> 01:24:23,300
I think it's 161 or 162 of the thread. Somebody tried, like, harassing the guy on AOL and

1255
01:24:23,300 --> 01:24:24,300
everything.

1256
01:24:24,300 --> 01:24:25,300
Wow, man.

1257
01:24:25,300 --> 01:24:31,020
I would not say harassing, but, you know, maybe borderline stalking the guy on AOL trying

1258
01:24:31,020 --> 01:24:35,660
to say, what's wrong with you? Fuck you, you fucking fuck! No, I'm kidding. It was more

1259
01:24:35,660 --> 01:24:38,300
mature than that, but, you know, not by much.

1260
01:24:38,300 --> 01:24:41,860
I mean, you know, part of half of me is, you know, saying, oh, yeah, go, you know, stick

1261
01:24:41,860 --> 01:24:45,060
up for us. The other half is, you ain't even played the game yourself. You know, what the

1262
01:24:45,060 --> 01:24:46,060
Hell do you know?

1263
01:24:46,060 --> 01:24:50,300
So, I mean, I think ultimately, you know, only God could judge us, and if he did, he'd

1264
01:24:50,300 --> 01:24:51,300
give us an A+.

1265
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:52,300
Or, okay, A-.

1266
01:24:52,300 --> 01:24:53,300
There's always room to improve.

1267
01:24:53,300 --> 01:24:54,300
Anyway, sorry.

1268
01:24:54,300 --> 01:25:03,300
We're getting a call in studio during show, which is quite rare, because most people know.

1269
01:25:03,300 --> 01:25:10,460
No, these are the stupid fuckers that, you know, have automated 1-800 numbers telemarkers.

1270
01:25:10,460 --> 01:25:11,460
Oh, okay.

1271
01:25:11,460 --> 01:25:15,620
Hi, this is Aris from GameStop.

1272
01:25:15,620 --> 01:25:17,420
Aris?

1273
01:25:17,420 --> 01:25:19,680
Are you dead?

1274
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:25,980
You get this automated call. Hi, this is Aris at GameStop.

1275
01:25:25,980 --> 01:25:30,260
You've reserved a blank game. And it's like, Aris is like a reference to Aris from Final Fantasy VII.

1276
01:25:30,260 --> 01:25:33,420
I guess. It's a meme, Mario!

1277
01:25:33,420 --> 01:25:37,020
I just wanted to let you know that your Sonic the Hedgehog game came in.

1278
01:25:37,020 --> 01:25:41,300
Mama mia! Even though, and people who have seen me play

1279
01:25:41,300 --> 01:25:45,820
Final Fantasy 7 know this because I have my game saved at this one particular place. So

1280
01:25:45,820 --> 01:25:50,460
that I can take this shit out of Jenova again and watch Aerith die all over again.

1281
01:25:50,460 --> 01:25:54,020
Yes, it's a great thing to relive, right? Oh my god you guys, stop spoiling Final Fantasy

1282
01:25:54,020 --> 01:26:03,020
7, I haven't played it yet. She dies! Get over it! And I cheer. Yeah, it's good. The

1283
01:26:03,020 --> 01:26:09,340
only thing, in my opinion, that could ruin Advent Children is if Aerith somehow comes

1284
01:26:09,340 --> 01:26:11,340
Oh my god, that would just...

1285
01:26:11,340 --> 01:26:14,340
Okay, so, that being said...

1286
01:26:14,340 --> 01:26:16,340
Guys, I have no feelings.

1287
01:26:16,340 --> 01:26:19,340
Why? Tifa is a much better woman.

1288
01:26:21,340 --> 01:26:22,340
She can kick ass.

1289
01:26:22,340 --> 01:26:26,340
I can't believe we're having this discussion, so I'm gonna change the subject back to this review.

1290
01:26:26,340 --> 01:26:29,340
If I got a call from Aris from Gamestop, I would run away.

1291
01:26:29,340 --> 01:26:31,340
Aris had codependency issues.

1292
01:26:31,340 --> 01:26:32,340
Yeah.

1293
01:26:34,340 --> 01:26:35,340
Oh my lord.

1294
01:26:35,340 --> 01:26:36,340
Lord.

1295
01:26:36,340 --> 01:26:41,020
Well, if you want to join in the fun, they posted his AOL screen name and everything.

1296
01:26:41,020 --> 01:26:44,900
I just think that's kind of interesting that they got the whole little, I mean, for lack

1297
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:49,220
of a better term, I know it's not these same guys, but I can't help but think of the word

1298
01:26:49,220 --> 01:26:52,780
Be Mafia to describe what's going on here.

1299
01:26:52,780 --> 01:26:56,300
I don't like using that term because I know it's not the same people, but you know what

1300
01:26:56,300 --> 01:26:57,300
I mean.

1301
01:26:57,300 --> 01:27:01,660
It's still the same idea where these guys are just hounding this poor guy that was just

1302
01:27:01,660 --> 01:27:06,380
review in and decided to knock this game a little bit because it wasn't his cup of tea,

1303
01:27:06,380 --> 01:27:10,540
wasn't Japanese enough for him, I guess, was the gist of the review.

1304
01:27:10,540 --> 01:27:16,020
I mean, you never know. Once a festival hits Japan, Japan critics are going to say, you

1305
01:27:16,020 --> 01:27:20,220
know, it's not American enough. That would be ironic, wouldn't it?

1306
01:27:20,220 --> 01:27:22,900
Wow. But the good news is that some other reviews

1307
01:27:22,900 --> 01:27:26,340
are coming out and I think we've seen like seven and a halfs and eights and, you know,

1308
01:27:26,340 --> 01:27:30,180
average DDR scores are on the board. But I think, again, a lot of these people don't

1309
01:27:30,180 --> 01:27:33,380
really you know the folks that review hundreds and hundreds of games you know

1310
01:27:33,380 --> 01:27:35,620
for the magazines and stuff you know they don't have time to submerse

1311
01:27:35,620 --> 01:27:39,180
themselves in the communities of all these games I don't think a lot of these

1312
01:27:39,180 --> 01:27:48,300
folks maybe realize just how different and it's like how anticipated this game

1313
01:27:48,300 --> 01:27:52,140
is in America just because it isn't a Japanese release you know what I mean I

1314
01:27:52,140 --> 01:27:58,180
don't know that's just my take on it I mean it's finally like one of those

1315
01:27:58,180 --> 01:28:02,180
games it seems to have very very very few ties to Japan other than the fact that

1316
01:28:02,180 --> 01:28:05,060
hey the game was originally created there but it's like you know whole new

1317
01:28:05,060 --> 01:28:08,500
interface, whole new game, whole new modes it's really truly like an American

1318
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:13,140
production. I think it's just kind of one of those things where it's just after

1319
01:28:13,140 --> 01:28:17,620
time that series will have its own identity more than anything and that's

1320
01:28:17,620 --> 01:28:22,540
all you can really I mean just die as a gamer think originality just like making

1321
01:28:22,540 --> 01:28:26,300
you know like being a little different I mean sure you know DDR is pretty

1322
01:28:26,300 --> 01:28:30,540
universal as far as like within Konami itself and all but if you got Ultra Mix 2 and it's

1323
01:28:30,540 --> 01:28:33,820
like always kind of like that cutting edge type thing it's like why you know some people

1324
01:28:33,820 --> 01:28:37,960
watch like M2 you know as opposed to MTV or you know watch all those other niche shows

1325
01:28:37,960 --> 01:28:41,220
because you know it's like they already know they like the game but they want to see it

1326
01:28:41,220 --> 01:28:44,920
to its you know maximum potential or it's something different and you know I mean it's

1327
01:28:44,920 --> 01:28:48,160
why not.

1328
01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:49,380
Very interesting.

1329
01:28:49,380 --> 01:28:54,300
Apparently now I'm getting a follow up apparently our old Orange Launch Radio favorite El Mullet

1330
01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:59,140
is the one that's been doing a little bit of this AOL harassing at this guy.

1331
01:28:59,140 --> 01:29:04,700
Hey, he's the pusher for the cookies, so he gets the amnesty right away.

1332
01:29:04,700 --> 01:29:09,060
That's right. But no, apparently he has responded. We don't know the details yet, though. I'm

1333
01:29:09,060 --> 01:29:12,980
hearing this all secondhand, but maybe we'll... Keep checking the freak for developments,

1334
01:29:12,980 --> 01:29:17,340
because maybe something will get posted there. Whoo! Drama, drama revolution. Gotta love

1335
01:29:17,340 --> 01:29:23,940
it. All right. It feels like old times, doesn't it?

1336
01:29:23,940 --> 01:29:29,940
DD Archaholic is still fixated on the whole once a male game and this is what she sent me in a private message.

1337
01:29:29,940 --> 01:29:37,940
She says, I want my boyfriend to watch me play the game and start crying because the game makes him feel inadequate while I enthusiastically play the hell out of it.

1338
01:29:37,940 --> 01:29:38,940
Who said this?

1339
01:29:38,940 --> 01:29:39,940
DD Archaholic.

1340
01:29:39,940 --> 01:29:42,940
Oh, I thought this was Rice Prince.

1341
01:29:42,940 --> 01:29:45,940
No, no. That would have been funny though.

1342
01:29:45,940 --> 01:29:47,940
That's great.

1343
01:29:47,940 --> 01:29:48,940
I'm sure she would have said it too.

1344
01:29:48,940 --> 01:29:57,940
You know what, though? That's happened. That's all personal preference, what game makes you want to play it so much.

1345
01:29:57,940 --> 01:30:04,940
There's been times where Ice Princess was so hooked on the game where she would just play it all the time and we didn't really have time for much else.

1346
01:30:04,940 --> 01:30:09,940
That's just how it is. You're a gamer, you're in a relationship, things like this happen.

1347
01:30:09,940 --> 01:30:14,940
So, why am I going on with like the whole, it's like I'm advising her or something.

1348
01:30:14,940 --> 01:30:17,940
Whatever. Yeah. Don't play Puzzle Pirates.

1349
01:30:19,940 --> 01:30:21,940
Sorry. Anyway.

1350
01:30:21,940 --> 01:30:25,940
Okay, I think it's time for us to get into the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.

1351
01:30:25,940 --> 01:30:27,940
What do you guys think?

1352
01:30:27,940 --> 01:30:29,940
Sure. Please.

1353
01:30:32,940 --> 01:30:36,940
Last week in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, Jamie won it with a song.

1354
01:30:36,940 --> 01:30:41,260
song I guess it's some sort of parody song it was a little silly five four

1355
01:30:41,260 --> 01:30:47,000
three one of that but it was very popular nonetheless it was nonetheless

1356
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:52,240
and that won our cage match with a sweeping victory it was Vlad with

1357
01:30:52,240 --> 01:30:55,920
electronic supersonic and that's the first song we're gonna hear a clip of in

1358
01:30:55,920 --> 01:31:01,300
tonight's cage match now here's the thing here's the thing yeah Loki much to

1359
01:31:01,300 --> 01:31:06,600
Loki's hatred he does not like this song he is only pissed off because he's the

1360
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:08,600
the one that usually puts the smart-ass songs in.

1361
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:12,600
I'm debating whether to put a really shitty song or a really good song tonight.

1362
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:14,600
Hold on, I have to agree. I...

1363
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:18,600
Papa Smurf was awesome.

1364
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:24,600
Okay, hold on. Way back in the day, back when you weren't in the hundreds yet in episodes,

1365
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:27,600
like probably not even in the 20s or something, I once...

1366
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:31,600
We didn't have three people for a cage match, so I once...

1367
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:34,600
I said, go ahead and put in one of my songs, and you're like, what is this?

1368
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:36,600
God, I'm not ready for this.

1369
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:40,600
And I put in a Aquabats song, which is a pretty popular ska group.

1370
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:45,600
And you said, I don't see that as a cage match song.

1371
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:51,600
How is Dark Sacular's song, though it is very funny, any different than that?

1372
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:54,600
It is not what you would see as a cage match song, but you didn't say anything.

1373
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:55,600
Here's the thing, though, in the past...

1374
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:57,600
No, the thing is, though, you're full of shit.

1375
01:31:57,600 --> 01:31:58,600
The thing is, though...

1376
01:31:58,600 --> 01:31:59,600
Oh, shit.

1377
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:00,600
Shut up before I shut my cock in your mouth.

1378
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:08,120
your mouth shut up the cage match has evolved an awful lot the past you know

1379
01:32:08,120 --> 01:32:12,200
hundred episodes we've been doing it I think it used to be the thing where it

1380
01:32:12,200 --> 01:32:17,520
was like DDR guitar breaks 2dx now it's kind of like cool stuff no no no wait

1381
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:22,560
wait okay wait I'm totally calling bullshit because I have said they're not

1382
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:27,920
age man just wait for about four weeks ago or five weeks ago Matt put on a song

1383
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:37,440
by um no no no no no no no the song you put on by um CompuFonic uh what's the name of the band?

1384
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:44,400
Echo Image. Echo Image um what's the name of that song? Come Back. Come Back. That song is awesome

1385
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:48,920
and you said I won't see it as a cage match song. I didn't I still don't. It totally fits perfectly

1386
01:32:48,920 --> 01:32:55,000
into the genre of music we play. It was techno pop or electro pop or whatever you know. I didn't and I still don't.

1387
01:32:55,000 --> 01:33:06,000
What do I know? Because it's the first song ever to have to be retired from the cage match, so obviously it doesn't come down to my opinion, it comes down to the opinion of the listeners.

1388
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:09,000
So put that in your pipe and smoke it.

1389
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:15,000
Whatever happened to the days when we used to say that we do this radio show for our amusement, not their amusement?

1390
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:18,000
Well, we sold out like cheap whores, what do you expect?

1391
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:22,000
Thank you, Sal. Thank you, Sal. Can I have a hug?

1392
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:25,000
Get away from me. Can I have a hug?

1393
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
I want a hug. There.

1394
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:30,000
We're going to put our differences aside.

1395
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:33,000
Stop trying to grope me. Get away from me.

1396
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:37,000
You're hugging very provocative.

1397
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:41,000
It feels very erotic. You've got to do that. I'm kidding.

1398
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:45,000
You want me to make a video game out of that?

1399
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:52,000
There was that one game that was at the Natsume booth at E3, where you go around kissing people.

1400
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,000
Yeah, Tulip.

1401
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:54,000
Tulip.

1402
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,000
Alright, anyway.

1403
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Hello, cage match.

1404
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Hello.

1405
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:58,880
Alright, we're gonna get into this.

1406
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:00,880
It's electronic supersonic.

1407
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:04,160
You get to hear a clip of it, because it won last week, and then you'll hear two new songs

1408
01:34:04,160 --> 01:34:08,160
in their entirety, and I can't wait to hear what you all have to say about my pick tonight.

1409
01:34:08,160 --> 01:34:09,160
He's gonna love it.

1410
01:34:09,160 --> 01:34:10,160
Anyway.

1411
01:34:10,160 --> 01:34:13,680
I thought we did piss Brad off on our show on Thursday.

1412
01:34:13,680 --> 01:34:14,680
Sorry, sorry.

1413
01:34:14,680 --> 01:34:21,680
Before we go, you can vote for this if you want. It's a clip of song number one. This is Zladd with Electronic Supersonic. Enjoy.

1414
01:34:44,680 --> 01:34:48,680
He doesn't have much time, my blue jeans is tight

1415
01:34:48,680 --> 01:34:51,680
So onto my love rocket climb

1416
01:34:51,680 --> 01:34:54,680
Inside tank of fuel is not fuel, but love

1417
01:34:54,680 --> 01:34:58,680
Above us, there is nothing above, but the stars above

1418
01:34:58,680 --> 01:35:01,680
All systems gone, prepare for down count

1419
01:35:01,680 --> 01:35:07,680
Five, four, three, one, off blast

1420
01:35:07,680 --> 01:35:10,680
Fly away my space rocket

1421
01:35:10,680 --> 01:35:13,680
You no need put money in my pocket

1422
01:35:13,680 --> 01:35:23,680
pocket. The door is closed, I just lock it. I put my gold plug in your socket.

1423
01:35:23,680 --> 01:35:30,680
The sun and sky is bright like fire. You and me gets higher and higher.

1424
01:35:30,680 --> 01:35:41,680
I've got no communication bias. The only thing that can stop us is flat tires.

1425
01:35:41,680 --> 01:35:45,680
Hail, love crusader, I want to be your space invader

1426
01:35:45,680 --> 01:35:48,680
For you I will descend the deepest moon crater

1427
01:35:48,680 --> 01:35:51,680
I is more stronger than Darth Vapour

1428
01:35:51,680 --> 01:35:54,680
Obey me, I is your new dictator

1429
01:35:54,680 --> 01:35:56,680
For you is Venus, I am Mars

1430
01:35:56,680 --> 01:35:59,680
With you I is more richer than all the stars

1431
01:35:59,680 --> 01:36:01,680
Make our wishes on our shooting stars

1432
01:36:01,680 --> 01:36:05,680
Then for you I will play on my cosmic guitar

1433
01:36:05,680 --> 01:36:09,680
Ladies and gentlemen, fasten your belts please

1434
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:14,680
Commence that with friends. I trust you enjoy this flight as much as you enjoy this act.

1435
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:41,680
because it's pretty funny. Pretty funny.

1436
01:36:41,680 --> 01:36:44,680
Alright, next up in the cage match, Loki's pick for this week.

1437
01:36:44,680 --> 01:36:46,680
Loki, what did you pick for us?

1438
01:36:46,680 --> 01:36:50,680
I picked Rammstein's song off their new album.

1439
01:36:50,680 --> 01:36:55,680
It's called America, and it's a nice American-hating song.

1440
01:36:55,680 --> 01:36:58,680
And I hate America, so here we go.

1441
01:36:58,680 --> 01:37:01,680
Alright, here's song number two, Rammstein.

1442
01:37:01,680 --> 01:37:04,680
And I just gotta say, now wait a minute.

1443
01:37:04,680 --> 01:37:07,680
See, Jamie puts in the song that I would expect Loki to put in,

1444
01:37:07,680 --> 01:37:10,880
to put in and now loki is putting in the song i would expect jamie to put in

1445
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:14,560
what is going on when the hell is going on with the show i've played this song

1446
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:18,000
plenty of times on my show and i'm going to put in the song that nobody would put

1447
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:22,400
in so here we go song number two i'm staying

1448
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:29,400
with America. Enjoy!

1449
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:25,400
For Paris, it may give out

1450
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:27,400
We're all

1451
01:38:27,400 --> 01:38:28,400

It's one of our

1456
01:38:37,400 --> 01:38:41,400
We're all living in America

01:38:41,400 --> 01:38:43,400
America

1458
01:38:43,400 --> 01:38:45,400
America

As Africa comes and down

1466
01:39:12,620 --> 01:39:14,620
So, I'm going to see Becky Mauss

1467
01:39:19,620 --> 01:39:23,620
We're all living in America

1468
01:39:23,620 --> 01:39:25,620
America

1469
01:39:25,620 --> 01:39:27,620
It's Wunderbar

1470
01:39:27,620 --> 01:39:30,620
We're all living in America

1471
01:39:30,620 --> 01:39:32,620
America

1472
01:39:32,620 --> 01:39:34,620
America

1473
01:39:34,620 --> 01:39:38,620
We're all living in America

1474
01:39:38,620 --> 01:39:40,620
Coca-Cola

1475
01:39:40,620 --> 01:39:42,620
On the block

1476
01:39:42,620 --> 01:39:46,620
We're all living in America

1477
01:39:46,620 --> 01:39:48,620
America

1478
01:39:48,620 --> 01:39:50,620
America

1479
01:39:50,620 --> 01:39:52,620
Chasing out another star

1480
01:39:54,620 --> 01:39:56,620
Chasing out another star

1481
01:39:58,620 --> 01:40:00,620
I don't think my mother's gone

1482
01:40:00,620 --> 01:40:24,620
We're all living in America, America

1483
01:40:24,620 --> 01:40:32,620
We're all living in America, America, it's one of ours

1484
01:40:32,620 --> 01:40:40,620
We're all living in America, America, America

1485
01:40:40,620 --> 01:40:47,620
We're all living in America, Coca-Cola, I'm trying to walk

1486
01:40:47,620 --> 01:40:55,620
We're all living in America, America, America

1487
01:40:55,620 --> 01:41:16,920
All right, that was song number two in tonight's cage match.

1488
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:20,860
That was Ramstein with America.

1489
01:41:20,860 --> 01:41:21,860
Very interesting.

1490
01:41:21,860 --> 01:41:24,380
And because I forgot to say it earlier and I forgot we're going to have a lot of new

1491
01:41:24,380 --> 01:41:27,940
listeners now with the whole DDR Freak radio syndication. I should explain what

1492
01:41:27,940 --> 01:41:31,660
the cage match is all about. That's where we play three songs, each host picks a

1493
01:41:31,660 --> 01:41:36,060
song, they go head-to-head against each other, and the winning song goes into

1494
01:41:36,060 --> 01:41:40,420
rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio Live. I'm sorry, not Orange Lounge Radio Live,

1495
01:41:40,420 --> 01:41:43,580
Orange Lounge Radio is the Mani Music and More program, which airs 24 hours a day,

1496
01:41:43,580 --> 01:41:48,220
7 days a week on Orange Lounge Radio. Again, the cage match kind of started as

1497
01:41:48,220 --> 01:41:53,500
songs that would be really good in DDR, 2DX, and Damani type games, but I think

1498
01:41:53,500 --> 01:41:56,760
just kind of turn into a clusterfuck of whatever school as I was telling Brad

1499
01:41:56,760 --> 01:42:01,060
earlier anyway we're going to give our thoughts on those songs but of course it

1500
01:42:01,060 --> 01:42:04,900
is up to you in the end what you think you are the ones that have the final say

1501
01:42:04,900 --> 01:42:10,240
but we're going to give you a hint Jamie want to go first nine this is a slump

1502
01:42:10,240 --> 01:42:19,180
sign oh you're not saying no you're saying like the number nine I'm sorry my

1503
01:42:19,180 --> 01:42:23,080
computer is doing that see you know how on XP when you hold shift for five

1504
01:42:23,080 --> 01:42:27,640
seconds and I hate that I'm having to turn that shit off yeah I hate that

1505
01:42:27,640 --> 01:42:33,080
shit turn that shit off I'm turning the shift off turn on I don't want my sticky

1506
01:42:33,080 --> 01:42:40,480
keys to come on without you know actually anything being on there I don't

1507
01:42:40,480 --> 01:42:46,440
get the keys stick usually anyway something else anyway yeah go ahead like

1508
01:42:46,440 --> 01:42:51,160
yourself like what should I rate it yes mmm definitely not one of the better

1509
01:42:51,160 --> 01:42:58,160
There's better songs than Duhas that they did.

1510
01:43:21,160 --> 01:43:26,160
I was torn between this one or Moscow, so Moscow would have been pretty good.

1511
01:43:26,160 --> 01:43:30,160
And you don't hate Moscow nearly as much as you hate America, so you had to pick America.

1512
01:43:30,160 --> 01:43:36,160
Well, Moscow, I had a girl that sings in it, it's like tattoo, and it's got also the...

1513
01:43:36,160 --> 01:43:38,160
Sounds like tattoo.

1514
01:43:38,160 --> 01:43:45,160
Yeah, and it also has accordion in the background, that kind of goes with it, it's weird, but it sounds good.

1515
01:43:45,160 --> 01:43:58,160
Um, I don't know, every time I hear, you know, all that kind of, you know, music, I think of, like, the German greats, you know, I think of vanilla ninja, I think of, uh, Falco, David Hasselhoff, you know?

1516
01:43:58,160 --> 01:44:01,160
I mean, so, I have to, I have to accept my hierarchy and-

1517
01:44:01,160 --> 01:44:03,160
Is Falco the guy that's saying putting on the ritz?

1518
01:44:03,160 --> 01:44:04,160
No, that was Taco.

1519
01:44:04,160 --> 01:44:05,160
Oh, Taco.

1520
01:44:05,160 --> 01:44:06,160
That was Rock Me on the Day.

1521
01:44:06,160 --> 01:44:07,160
Rock Me on the Day.

1522
01:44:07,160 --> 01:44:08,160
Oh my God.

1523
01:44:08,160 --> 01:44:09,160
Taco, Taco.

1524
01:44:09,160 --> 01:44:10,160
Damn it!

1525
01:44:10,160 --> 01:44:11,160
Damn it!

1526
01:44:40,160 --> 01:44:47,060
fun one to play. Umm, explicit. Well, it's a pretty interesting song, but I've heard

1527
01:44:47,060 --> 01:44:52,740
better songs from Ramstein, so I'm gonna give it a 7 out of 10. Alright, there you have

1528
01:44:52,740 --> 01:44:55,740
it. Alright, but it doesn't matter what we think, it's all up to what you guys think.

1529
01:44:55,740 --> 01:45:01,700
It's no ODB, but it'll have to do. What? It's no ODB, but it'll have to do. Rest in peace,

1530
01:45:01,700 --> 01:45:09,980
Russell Jones, AKA Dirt McGirt. AKA Big Baby Jesus, AKA Osiris. AKA me and Mariah Carey

1531
01:45:09,980 --> 01:45:13,680
like babies and pastimes.

1532
01:45:13,680 --> 01:45:15,680
What's your favorite ODB quote?

1533
01:45:15,680 --> 01:45:20,680
I'm going to refrain from comments, be polite.

1534
01:45:20,680 --> 01:45:21,680
Alright, anyway.

1535
01:45:21,680 --> 01:45:22,680
He died last night, dude.

1536
01:45:22,680 --> 01:45:23,680
Moving on.

1537
01:45:23,680 --> 01:45:25,400
Yes, ODB died, he collapsed in the studio.

1538
01:45:25,400 --> 01:45:27,400
He literally dropped dead.

1539
01:45:27,400 --> 01:45:29,120
At the age of 35 or 36.

1540
01:45:29,120 --> 01:45:31,600
He literally just dropped dead in the studio.

1541
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:35,240
No, just in the music field, prior to recording, which proves to us once again cocaine is a

1542
01:45:35,240 --> 01:45:36,240
hell of a drug.

1543
01:45:36,240 --> 01:45:40,240
You know he died with a 40 in his hand.

1544
01:45:40,240 --> 01:45:44,240
And still owing like six child support payments to his baby mama.

1545
01:45:44,240 --> 01:45:49,240
You know, he probably was dead like about 30 minutes before he actually fell to the floor.

1546
01:45:49,240 --> 01:45:52,240
You know, it's just the cracking that was keeping him going.

1547
01:45:52,240 --> 01:45:55,240
Can I get to my song, please?

1548
01:45:55,240 --> 01:45:56,240
Comment, DarkCycla?

1549
01:45:56,240 --> 01:45:58,240
I just can't...

1550
01:45:58,240 --> 01:46:03,240
Don't feel very mournful over someone who didn't take responsibility for his children, so...

1551
01:46:03,240 --> 01:46:04,240
I'm not the biggest fan either, but...

1552
01:46:04,240 --> 01:46:07,700
have a forty-ounce tip in his honor so we had to uh...

1553
01:46:07,700 --> 01:46:10,420
do something here in a bad idea

1554
01:46:10,420 --> 01:46:11,980
anyway

1555
01:46:11,980 --> 01:46:15,220
moving on uh... my pick

1556
01:46:15,220 --> 01:46:19,380
probably a controversial one but i don't care because it's a top forty songs that

1557
01:46:19,380 --> 01:46:20,780
i'm putting in tonight

1558
01:46:20,780 --> 01:46:24,060
and usually we don't put in top forty songs but i swear to god

1559
01:46:24,060 --> 01:46:28,820
this song is so danceable and it's so eighties i love this song

1560
01:46:28,820 --> 01:46:31,240
it's so awesome

1561
01:46:31,240 --> 01:46:37,240
I'm just going to say it, it is Gwen Stefani, and the song is What You Waitin' For, hoe?

1562
01:46:37,240 --> 01:46:42,240
Alright, and here it is, enjoy, I think this song will be perfect for DDR, you be the judge.

1563
01:46:42,240 --> 01:46:46,400
number three, Gwen Stefani, What You Waiting For. Enjoy.

1564
01:47:12,240 --> 01:47:16,200
Yeah, I-I-I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I,

1565
01:47:16,200 --> 01:47:19,960
I'm like a kid who needs to fit a moving car.

1566
01:47:19,960 --> 01:47:23,800
Scary conversation, shit my eyes, can't find a break.

1567
01:47:23,800 --> 01:47:27,020
What if they say that you're a clobber?

1568
01:47:27,020 --> 01:47:30,220
And actually, I'm worried if I do it alone.

1569
01:47:30,220 --> 01:47:34,160
Who really cares, cause if you laugh you never know it could be great.

1570
01:47:34,160 --> 01:47:37,180
Take a chance, cause you might grow.

1571
01:47:37,180 --> 01:47:41,580
Ooh, oh, oh...

1572
01:47:41,580 --> 01:47:47,800
what you waiting, what you waiting, what you waiting, what you waiting, what you waiting for

1573
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:54,420
what you waiting, what you waiting, what you waiting, what you waiting, what you waiting for

1574
01:47:54,900 --> 01:47:59,020
come on take it back, take it back, take it back, take it back

1575
01:47:59,020 --> 01:48:02,320
i want the chance to know it all

1576
01:48:02,320 --> 01:48:05,540
like your boots is that you're repeating yourself

1577
01:48:05,540 --> 01:48:09,340
you knew it all by yourself, while you're standing in one place

1578
01:48:09,340 --> 01:48:13,340
I'm going to floss, I'm going to carry you

1579
01:48:13,340 --> 01:48:16,340
You know you don't deserve your things from the zone

1580
01:48:16,340 --> 01:48:19,340
I know it's a mess, that's how a society all fits

1581
01:48:19,340 --> 01:48:23,340
We should let this show you're capable

1582
01:48:28,340 --> 01:48:31,340
And look at your watch now

1583
01:48:31,340 --> 01:48:35,340
You're still a super hot female

1584
01:48:35,340 --> 01:48:38,340
You bet your million dollar contract

1585
01:48:38,340 --> 01:48:41,340
And never waited for your heart attack

1586
01:48:41,340 --> 01:48:55,340
Oh, what you waiting, what you waiting, what you waiting, what you waiting, what you waiting for?

1587
01:48:55,340 --> 01:49:00,340
I can't wait to go

1588
01:49:00,340 --> 01:49:04,340
Back into Japan

1589
01:49:04,340 --> 01:49:09,340
Give me lots of brand new fans

1590
01:49:09,340 --> 01:49:14,340
Osaka, Tokyo

1591
01:49:14,340 --> 01:49:18,340
Your hair is shook, good girl

1592
01:49:18,340 --> 01:49:23,340
Damn, you've got the wicked style

1593
01:49:25,340 --> 01:49:28,340
Look at your watch now

1594
01:49:28,340 --> 01:49:31,340
You're still a supermodel female

1595
01:49:31,340 --> 01:49:37,880
You've got your million-dollar contract And they're all waiting for your lunch at it

1596
01:49:37,880 --> 01:49:57,900
And what you waiting, what you waiting, what you waiting, what you waiting, what you waiting for?

1597
01:50:27,900 --> 01:50:33,680
Alright, that was song number three in tonight's cage match. Gwen Stefani, what you waiting

1598
01:50:33,680 --> 01:50:39,120
for? And I can tell you right now, we waiting for Jamie. Oh, here she comes. Jamie, I know

1599
01:50:39,120 --> 01:50:46,900
you were gone for part of that. What did you think? It's too happy. It's a happy, too happy

1600
01:50:46,900 --> 01:50:54,060
seven. Yeah, it's a happy shiny seven. Happy shiny seven. Alright, lanky seven. Or is it

1601
01:50:54,060 --> 01:51:14,060
I like that song a lot. I actually didn't hear that she was going solo until really recently and then all of a sudden here's her song and I was kind of like, eh, not a big surprise the sound style she took. It's kind of cliche, but it's still cool. I like it. Dancy. Good stuff.

1602
01:51:14,060 --> 01:51:15,060
Oscar, I want to know.

1603
01:51:15,060 --> 01:51:19,060
Oh, sorry. I'd say probably an 8.5.

1604
01:51:19,060 --> 01:51:20,060
5?

1605
01:51:20,060 --> 01:51:21,060
Let me go there.

1606
01:51:21,060 --> 01:51:22,060
Loki!

1607
01:51:22,060 --> 01:51:27,740
Um, well, there's two things that that song was lacking.

1608
01:51:27,740 --> 01:51:32,100
Number one, well actually one thing that I didn't like about it, it was top 40.

1609
01:51:32,100 --> 01:51:34,580
Number two, it did not have any English in it.

1610
01:51:34,580 --> 01:51:36,040
There's no English in that song.

1611
01:51:36,040 --> 01:51:38,460
The other two songs featured English.

1612
01:51:38,460 --> 01:51:39,460
That song had none.

1613
01:51:39,460 --> 01:51:41,460
Therefore, it gets a 6.

1614
01:51:41,460 --> 01:51:42,460
Blow-walk.

1615
01:51:42,460 --> 01:51:45,160
Um, I like it.

1616
01:51:45,160 --> 01:51:49,880
I think it's kind of doubled on the fact that I think the video for it was actually very cool and

1617
01:51:50,120 --> 01:51:53,040
ever since watching that video I too would like to

1618
01:51:53,640 --> 01:51:56,720
Find a way to express how a giraffe does sound

1619
01:51:57,400 --> 01:52:01,520
Because like in the before it does I haven't seen the video like she's trying to get inspiration

1620
01:52:01,520 --> 01:52:05,160
So she goes to like some clinic or whatever they give her a survey and one of the questions

1621
01:52:05,160 --> 01:52:09,840
She has to answer is in your best way possible describe write out what the sound of giraffe makes

1622
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:18,840
But I think it's really a bounce. Definitely a pretty cool song. It's very reminiscent of like I would say probably mid 80's production of Debbie Harry.

1623
01:52:18,840 --> 01:52:24,840
So I can totally get with that and this is one of those times where I do have to give out double digits. A 10 for me.

1624
01:52:24,840 --> 01:52:29,840
Wow. I gotta say, you know what? That song just makes me want to shake my booty and spank yours.

1625
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:34,840
Give it a 5.

1626
01:52:34,840 --> 01:52:36,840
I give it a 9 and a half.

1627
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:37,880
uh...

1628
01:52:37,880 --> 01:52:41,920
explicit

1629
01:52:41,920 --> 01:52:45,520
well i don't really like the song, i like how Gwen Stefani went

1630
01:52:45,520 --> 01:52:46,680
to the direction

1631
01:52:46,680 --> 01:52:49,240
that had more of like an 80's

1632
01:52:49,240 --> 01:52:51,240
kind of background

1633
01:52:51,240 --> 01:52:55,440
but at the same time i don't know, maybe i'm not used to her music

1634
01:52:55,440 --> 01:52:58,160
for that type of direction

1635
01:52:58,160 --> 01:53:00,000
so i'd probably give it uh...

1636
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,560
that's a pretty good song, so i'd give it an 8.5

1637
01:53:02,560 --> 01:53:08,560
might as well be because of the sky is about as big as it has, so I'm going to play 5 for you.

1638
01:53:08,560 --> 01:53:12,560
Alright, well good thing it's not up to these guys. It's up to you guys in the chat room.

Rocket, you know need put money in my pocket.

1642
01:53:23,560 --> 01:53:27,560
The door is closed, I just lock it.

1643
01:53:27,560 --> 01:53:30,560
I put my gold plug in your socket.

1647
01:54:08,480 --> 01:54:15,520

1648
01:54:15,520 --> 01:54:25,100
week. Nada. Um, I think I mentioned last week, um, what was it? Release Candidate 2 of Step

1649
01:54:25,100 --> 01:54:30,480
Mania came out, and other than that, there's really only thing that's worth mentioning

1650
01:54:30,480 --> 01:54:34,840
is there's a contest, a theme contest that's going on. With all the themes that have been

1651
01:54:34,840 --> 01:54:41,200
made this year, they're trying to get DDR Maniac's theme of 2004. With, you know, many

1652
01:54:41,200 --> 01:54:47,160
in the running like, no, Technofeen, which is in the lead, and some other ones that are

1653
01:54:47,160 --> 01:54:54,280
on there, or, yeah, Technofeen. Anyways, Technolize, Technofeen, I can't remember what it's called.

1654
01:54:54,280 --> 01:55:04,280
Anyways, so yeah, those are worth checking out. I know Technolize is working on version 3.0, which is supposed to be, like, completely redone.

1655
01:55:04,280 --> 01:55:11,280
It's still nice looking. And then, other than that, really not too much going on right now.

1656
01:55:11,280 --> 01:55:23,280
I've been checking out this week, actually, BMS sim files. For those who don't know what those are, those are the homemade key-sounded BeatMania 2DX sim files

1657
01:55:23,280 --> 01:55:28,600
Sim files that are out there and I mean there's really still a lot of talented artists out there that you have working on these things

1658
01:55:29,560 --> 01:55:35,460
The ones I've been checking out though have been by Yama Jet, which is also featured in Food Mix and Food Mix Plus

1659
01:55:36,120 --> 01:55:37,520
There's some pretty cool stuff

1660
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:42,040
I wanted to play on the show, but I can't because the volumes all fucked up on it

1661
01:55:42,040 --> 01:55:43,200
So I gotta go fix those

1662
01:55:43,200 --> 01:55:49,320
But there's one that was a remix of We Will Rock You called I Will Rock You and it was really cool

1663
01:55:49,320 --> 01:55:53,480
actually very cool they turned into a house the song which is pretty neat and

1664
01:55:53,480 --> 01:56:00,000
then I have a remix of the fall that's on there and there's also paranoia Delta

1665
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:06,160
but that one's too much noise for the it's like too grungy so not worth

1666
01:56:06,160 --> 01:56:09,900
playing on the show but you can find those there's some files out there for

1667
01:56:09,900 --> 01:56:17,420
them also one that was pointed out and I found would be it was cigaru 180 which

1668
01:56:17,420 --> 01:56:25,420
was by this, the only Russian Bimani remixer that I've seen. It's actually pretty cool.

1669
01:56:25,420 --> 01:56:31,460
We might be able to play that later. But those are pretty much all that's really going on.

1670
01:56:31,460 --> 01:56:35,260
How long is it? It's only like a minute and fifty, right? Yeah, it's not that long. But

1671
01:56:35,260 --> 01:56:38,340
oh, the other thing I was going to mention that's working on, obviously being worked

1672
01:56:38,340 --> 01:56:43,540
on right now, is Dance of the Stage of Fusion's N-Files on DDRUK. Queue it up, let's hear

1673
01:56:43,540 --> 01:56:45,580
the, let's hear the Subaru remix, because I heard a little bit of it, and I actually

1674
01:56:45,580 --> 01:56:51,280
really liked it too. So let's let our listeners hear a little bit of it. Again, if you enjoy

1675
01:56:51,280 --> 01:56:57,120
Bomani remixes, then might I urge you to tune in to Diversion, the Orange Launch Radio Remix

1676
01:56:57,120 --> 01:57:01,880
Show, which airs every Monday night at 7 o'clock Pacific Standard Time on our station. Check

1677
01:57:01,880 --> 01:57:07,020
it out. And of course, this week will be the first question in that show for the Akira

1678
01:57:07,020 --> 01:57:11,800
Yomoka signed CD contest. If you're just joining us, check out our website, www.orangelaunchradio.com

1679
01:57:11,800 --> 01:57:16,740
for all the details. Okay, here it is. Loki's going to spin this for us. What's this remix

1680
01:57:16,740 --> 01:57:24,640
called again? It's Zagaru180 and the guy that remixed it, his name is Vospy. And he's got

1681
01:57:24,640 --> 01:57:29,600
his own site. I really have to search hard to find it. He's a member on DDRUK. He does

1682
01:57:29,600 --> 01:57:36,800
a lot of stuff with the Pump It Up scene over there, I guess. But, yeah, Zagaru180. It's

1683
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:38,920
It's only about a little over two minutes.

1684
01:57:38,920 --> 01:57:39,920
So here we go.

1685
01:57:39,920 --> 01:57:42,920
And I check this out.

1686
01:57:42,920 --> 01:57:46,940
The

1687
01:57:46,940 --> 01:57:50,740
the

1688
01:57:50,740 --> 01:57:52,340
the

1689
01:57:52,340 --> 01:57:54,340
the

1690
01:57:54,340 --> 01:58:01,620
the

1691
01:58:01,620 --> 01:58:06,240
of

1692
01:58:06,240 --> 01:58:08,900
the

1693
01:59:38,900 --> 02:00:01,900
I'm out of practice and my hand cramps up pretty quick.

1694
02:00:01,900 --> 02:00:09,260
So, I must mean you're getting, you know, some action then, because you haven't been

1695
02:00:09,260 --> 02:00:10,260
taking care of yourself.

1696
02:00:10,260 --> 02:00:11,260
If your hand, you're not...

1697
02:00:11,260 --> 02:00:14,260
No, my wrist is fine, my hand, that's not...

1698
02:00:14,260 --> 02:00:17,380
He said his wrist is fine, it's his hand that's not.

1699
02:00:17,380 --> 02:00:18,380
Anyway...

1700
02:00:18,380 --> 02:00:19,380
I see.

1701
02:00:19,380 --> 02:00:22,660
Alright, let's get to the winner of tonight's cage match, shall we?

1702
02:00:22,660 --> 02:00:24,660
We took some votes while that song was on.

1703
02:00:24,660 --> 02:00:26,140
You guys ready to hear tonight's winner?

1704
02:00:26,140 --> 02:00:27,780
What do you guys think won?

1705
02:00:27,780 --> 02:00:28,780
I always poll.

1706
02:00:28,780 --> 02:00:31,500
I would say the third song, definitely won.

1707
02:00:31,500 --> 02:00:42,180
let's see if it was a shocker tonight. Tonight's winner was not a shocker. It was close, though.

1708
02:00:42,180 --> 02:00:43,180
The votes were very-

1709
02:00:43,180 --> 02:00:47,100
I'm singing up the worst piece of shit I can find next week.

1710
02:00:47,100 --> 02:00:52,680
Hey, sing the song. And I remind you, you just had a song retired. It's time to let

1711
02:00:52,680 --> 02:00:58,500
Jamie and I bounce some back and forth for a little while, so. All right. So there you

1712
02:00:58,500 --> 02:01:04,060
So, my song wins tonight and Jamie and Loki bring new songs to the table next week.

1713
02:01:04,060 --> 02:01:09,220
Alright, before we go to a break, and I know we want to get to the FUs of the evening probably

1714
02:01:09,220 --> 02:01:12,020
when we come back from the next break, but I wanted to give mention to this.

1715
02:01:12,020 --> 02:01:14,940
This is pretty big Bomani news we haven't gotten to yet.

1716
02:01:14,940 --> 02:01:17,940
Guitar Freaks and Drummania are getting a makeover.

1717
02:01:17,940 --> 02:01:20,300
Loki, you've probably read up more on this than I have.

1718
02:01:20,300 --> 02:01:22,940
What do you know about the new Guitar Freaks and Drummania?

1719
02:01:22,940 --> 02:01:27,340
All I know about it is it's V, and not the song, but it's V.

1720
02:01:27,340 --> 02:01:34,340
Guitar Freaks and Drummania V. V standing for Vest. That still doesn't make any sense though.

1721
02:01:34,340 --> 02:01:38,340
But, what the theme is going to be for this release is going to be gears and machinery.

1722
02:01:38,340 --> 02:01:41,340
So you're going to see some pretty kick-ass interfaces at least.

1723
02:01:41,340 --> 02:01:46,340
The revamping, I guess the results screen is supposed to be more 3D or something like that.

1724
02:01:46,340 --> 02:01:47,340
God knows what they're going to do with that.

1725
02:01:47,340 --> 02:01:51,340
The movies that are going to be playing during it, it's going to be something similar to 2DX,

1726
02:01:51,340 --> 02:01:54,340
where you're going to see full motion video and stuff like that.

1727
02:01:54,340 --> 02:01:56,340
That means a hardware upgrade.

1728
02:01:56,340 --> 02:02:01,500
it's going to be a hardware upgrade, yes. It's going to be just like 2DX 10 style in

1729
02:02:01,500 --> 02:02:07,980
red. It's going to be running off of a PC-like hardware system. Another thing that they were

1730
02:02:07,980 --> 02:02:12,860
saying that's supposed to be in there is about 230 songs starting, I think. And that's not

1731
02:02:12,860 --> 02:02:18,860
including, I think, the unlocks from, you know, obviously the EMEA stuff. Other than

1732
02:02:18,860 --> 02:02:25,900
that, really not much else other than they mentioned a few songs on, for test locations,

1733
02:02:25,900 --> 02:02:29,780
I know that we're on there and some licensed stuff.

1734
02:02:29,780 --> 02:02:34,800
One song that's being pointed out in our chat room specifically by Dark LionXVI says Miserylou,

1735
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:37,260
which was the theme from Pulp Fiction.

1736
02:02:37,260 --> 02:02:38,260
Miserylou.

1737
02:02:38,260 --> 02:02:39,260
Oh, Miserylou.

1738
02:02:39,260 --> 02:02:40,260
I'm white, okay.

1739
02:02:40,260 --> 02:02:41,260
Miserylou.

1740
02:02:41,260 --> 02:02:42,260
No.

1741
02:02:42,260 --> 02:02:43,260
Is it?

1742
02:02:43,260 --> 02:02:44,260
No.

1743
02:02:44,260 --> 02:02:45,260
Read the letters.

1744
02:02:45,260 --> 02:02:46,260
Sound it out.

1745
02:02:46,260 --> 02:02:47,260
Miserylou.

1746
02:02:47,260 --> 02:02:48,260
No, there's nothing between the R and the L.

1747
02:02:48,260 --> 02:02:49,260
Ah, shut up.

1748
02:02:49,260 --> 02:02:50,260
God.

1749
02:02:50,260 --> 02:02:51,260
I don't care.

1750
02:02:51,260 --> 02:02:52,260
It's a theme from Pulp Fiction.

1751
02:02:52,260 --> 02:02:53,260
That's the bottom line.

1752
02:02:53,260 --> 02:02:54,260
We all know that song.

1753
02:02:54,260 --> 02:02:55,260
Dude, turn your phone off, dude.

1754
02:02:55,260 --> 02:02:57,260
I have to turn off your phone for this show.

1755
02:03:25,260 --> 02:03:27,260
Going Up by Colors

1756
02:03:27,260 --> 02:03:31,260
I just want to say it's awesome that there's a band called Pooh in Guitar Freaks and Drummania.

1757
02:03:31,260 --> 02:03:35,260
What song are you going to play? Pooh?

1758
02:03:35,260 --> 02:03:42,260
And as we were mentioning before, Miseraloo is Spaghetti Surfers,

1759
02:03:42,260 --> 02:03:50,260
Wild Challenger by Jindo, NGS by Asian Kung Fu Generation,

1760
02:03:50,260 --> 02:03:56,260
Nocturne number 9 sounds like, you know, number 9, but by some Japanese group here.

1761
02:03:56,260 --> 02:04:02,260
And the extra stage will be Heaven's Cocktail.

1762
02:04:02,260 --> 02:04:05,260
My big five.

1763
02:04:05,260 --> 02:04:10,260
And Heaven's Cocktail.

1764
02:04:10,260 --> 02:04:15,260
Do you get one of those cool little umbrella things with it too?

1765
02:04:15,260 --> 02:04:19,140
But anyways, so yeah, that's kind of what's going on.

1766
02:04:19,140 --> 02:04:25,740
Linked to the Konami test page or whatever on OrangeLawnsRadio.com.

1767
02:04:25,740 --> 02:04:29,140
So if you can read Japanese, you'll definitely get a kick out of this site.

1768
02:04:29,140 --> 02:04:30,140
Also...

1769
02:04:30,140 --> 02:04:31,140
Pictures!

1770
02:04:31,140 --> 02:04:32,140
Pictures are on the page!

1771
02:04:32,140 --> 02:04:33,140
Oh okay, cool.

1772
02:04:33,140 --> 02:04:35,680
I also can't remember if we linked to this or not, I don't, I actually don't think I

1773
02:04:35,680 --> 02:04:38,100
ran a story on it, I'm going to have to tomorrow.

1774
02:04:38,100 --> 02:04:44,060
I did pick wind though that Konami is doing another survey, remember how they did a big

1775
02:04:44,060 --> 02:04:49,080
They're putting their feelers out there for a 2d x7 style. Well this time the game they're taking surveys for

1776
02:04:49,820 --> 02:04:52,340
karaoke revolution bamani edition

1777
02:04:53,380 --> 02:05:00,140
There in Japan they are putting out the feelers right now for a karaoke revolution edition with all bamani songs in it

1778
02:05:00,700 --> 02:05:07,300
Wouldn't that be something else? It'd just be like watching a DDR third mix all over again. Seriously. That's basically what it is

1779
02:05:08,020 --> 02:05:11,000
More info on that to follow. We don't have to know a whole lot about that right now

1780
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:13,840
Now all we know is that I think they were looking for three thousand which isn't a very

1781
02:05:13,840 --> 02:05:14,840
big number.

1782
02:05:14,840 --> 02:05:19,280
So it looks like that will probably happen, the Karaoke Revolution, Bomani edition.

1783
02:05:19,280 --> 02:05:21,640
And for some people it will finally be an excuse for them to play.

1784
02:05:21,640 --> 02:05:26,400
And maybe those kids that were trying to get Murmur Twins in Karaoke Revolution will finally

1785
02:05:26,400 --> 02:05:27,400
get their way.

1786
02:05:27,400 --> 02:05:31,400
Which would be very interesting, I think, if Murmur Twins made it in there.

1787
02:05:31,400 --> 02:05:34,400
I'll have to see.

1788
02:05:34,400 --> 02:05:45,400
need to put this in here. Um, what was that, uh, uh, Naha and, uh, Gachukun. That'd be

1789
02:05:45,400 --> 02:05:51,840
great. Um, yeah, so, there's not too much going on. We're still waiting to hear more

1790
02:05:51,840 --> 02:05:55,440
about Dancing Stage Fusion, the arcade mix, because that's going to be the huge news to

1791
02:05:55,440 --> 02:06:01,240
come out. Because, you know, if Europe's doing it, then, well, guess what, the hardware's

1792
02:06:01,240 --> 02:06:06,240
All they have to do is make the game. Or another game for another region.

1793
02:06:06,240 --> 02:06:11,240
I'm surprised that we're not seeing a new arcade mix for Japan.

1794
02:06:11,240 --> 02:06:16,240
It's not that hard to make it once the hardware is done or whatever.

1795
02:06:16,240 --> 02:06:21,240
So it'll be interesting. At least maybe we'll see some arcades import that over here.

1796
02:06:21,240 --> 02:06:26,240
Because they'll get desperate and not wanting to wait any longer.

1797
02:06:26,240 --> 02:06:27,240
So, yeah.

1798
02:06:27,240 --> 02:06:46,660
Yeah, DDR Extreme Plus, or the so-called NICS that they claim is new, is actually on CCL,

1799
02:06:46,660 --> 02:06:47,660
Country Cub Lanes.

1800
02:06:47,660 --> 02:06:48,660
Interesting.

1801
02:06:48,660 --> 02:06:50,480
Our local bowling alley, where DDR was born here in Sacramento.

1802
02:06:50,480 --> 02:06:51,480
Very interesting.

1803
02:06:51,480 --> 02:06:52,840
I kind of want to check that out.

1804
02:06:52,840 --> 02:06:56,640
You know what's very cool about Country Club Lanes here in Sacramento, our bowling alley

1805
02:06:56,640 --> 02:06:59,080
where DDR was born here in this area?

1806
02:06:59,080 --> 02:07:02,600
It's 24 hours, which makes it very cool for DDR, since it's open 24 hours.

1807
02:07:02,600 --> 02:07:05,400
Yeah, but there are still those nights you have to pay the cover charge to get in.

1808
02:07:05,400 --> 02:07:06,400
That's very true.

1809
02:07:06,400 --> 02:07:07,400
That's very true.

1810
02:07:07,400 --> 02:07:09,440
And that sucks.

1811
02:07:09,440 --> 02:07:14,600
I remember, I mean, back in the day, you used to hang out, like, till midnight and go play

1812
02:07:14,600 --> 02:07:17,560
DDR till 3 in the morning.

1813
02:07:17,560 --> 02:07:19,800
I remember the days of glow bowling.

1814
02:07:19,800 --> 02:07:21,960
I remember the days where we would go...

1815
02:07:21,960 --> 02:07:25,480
seriously need to go global and remember back in the day right when Rocky Horror

1816
02:07:25,480 --> 02:07:29,720
first died and the sacramentals were coming together you and me and melody

1817
02:07:29,720 --> 02:07:37,160
all went yes I do remember that like quite and we were like tired I remember

1818
02:07:37,160 --> 02:07:39,920
going and we go and then we played DDR and that was back when they still had I

1819
02:07:39,920 --> 02:07:44,400
think 1.5 makes I see I seem to recall that that I remember being assaulted on

1820
02:07:44,400 --> 02:07:48,560
the 1.5 machine yeah oh it's fun good time I think when we went it was

1821
02:07:48,560 --> 02:07:53,720
actually up to a fifth mix at the time yeah yeah that that junk guy came and

1822
02:07:53,720 --> 02:07:58,280
tried to take a swing at me while I was playing oh I remember that and I posted

1823
02:07:58,280 --> 02:08:04,880
it had to have been a page and a half in word and posted it on DDR freak and they

1824
02:08:04,880 --> 02:08:08,360
got so much bad press from it and I talked to the manager the next that was

1825
02:08:08,360 --> 02:08:13,320
awesome yeah and they had security guards there afterwards you better have

1826
02:08:13,320 --> 02:08:17,040
your best face on when Jamie comes down which comes to your arcade I believe in

1827
02:08:17,040 --> 02:08:24,600
good service, thank you. Good memories there. Any location that has 24 hour DDR is fun.

1828
02:08:24,600 --> 02:08:30,920
Any place now is completely at my mercy now that I've got my business law book. Because

1829
02:08:30,920 --> 02:08:38,140
now I could have sued them for not providing, for not fulfilling their duty of utmost care.

1830
02:08:38,140 --> 02:08:43,560
Don't mess with her, she got a law book now. Damn. So very interesting though, going back

1831
02:08:43,560 --> 02:08:47,760
to the fact that Dancing Stage Fusion is going to be having a brand new cabinet coming out

1832
02:08:47,760 --> 02:08:51,200
could be a very good sign for DDR, could be just a red herring, who knows?

1833
02:08:51,200 --> 02:08:52,200
Well, you never know.

1834
02:08:52,200 --> 02:08:54,880
I mean, also, you've got to think of it like this.

1835
02:08:54,880 --> 02:08:58,560
When they did DDR Extreme, they even mentioned as much like in concert, I believe, they said

1836
02:08:58,560 --> 02:09:02,680
they had to take a break from DDR because, you know, for whatever reason, and it was

1837
02:09:02,680 --> 02:09:07,320
at the point where they had created the DDR mix like once a year, practically, and sometimes

1838
02:09:07,320 --> 02:09:08,320
you just got to...

1839
02:09:08,320 --> 02:09:09,320
Yeah, it was like...

1840
02:09:09,320 --> 02:09:11,520
I think we got like fourth and fifth mix in the same year.

1841
02:09:11,520 --> 02:09:16,520
Oh yeah, you had 4th, and then you had 4th Plus come out, and then 5th was shortly thereafter.

1842
02:09:16,520 --> 02:09:19,520
Yeah, it was like 4th, 4th Plus, and then like 5th and Max came out in the same year, I think.

1843
02:09:19,520 --> 02:09:23,520
Yeah, so I think it was, you know, long overdue, at least just for a little time off.

1844
02:09:23,520 --> 02:09:27,520
So it wouldn't surprise me the least bit to see a new DDR come out.

1845
02:09:27,520 --> 02:09:30,520
I mean, you know, that's just how it works.

1846
02:09:30,520 --> 02:09:32,520
I mean, it's probably a good thing they took a break.

1847
02:09:32,520 --> 02:09:37,520
I mean, I'd like to see them take that break, you know, from almost every series, you know, once in a while.

1848
02:09:37,520 --> 02:09:43,380
Because you're looking, I think, seeing how 2DX and Guitar Freaks and Drummania have been

1849
02:09:43,380 --> 02:09:45,800
cranking out babies and all that kind of stuff.

1850
02:09:45,800 --> 02:09:48,800
I think it's a good thing that Guitar Freaks and Drummania is getting an overhaul, though.

1851
02:09:48,800 --> 02:09:51,400
Because honestly, it was getting to a point when they got, like, what are they on, like

1852
02:09:51,400 --> 02:09:52,480
11th mix now?

1853
02:09:52,480 --> 02:09:53,480
I just...

1854
02:09:53,480 --> 02:09:57,040
Yeah, it's been the same damn game since 5th mix, just with different songs.

1855
02:09:57,040 --> 02:10:01,020
It's kind of got to the point where it's like, oh, Guitar Freaks is getting a new mix, must

1856
02:10:01,020 --> 02:10:02,020
be Monday.

1857
02:10:02,020 --> 02:10:03,020
You know, it's like...

1858
02:10:03,020 --> 02:10:05,880
Seriously, it's kind of getting to the point where it's getting a little stale, so I'm

1859
02:10:05,880 --> 02:10:10,000
I'm kind of glad to see they're giving that series a swift kick in the butt, and 2DX getting

1860
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:11,160
a swift kick in the butt.

1861
02:10:11,160 --> 02:10:14,680
I hope that, logically, DDR is going to be the next series now that's getting a swift

1862
02:10:14,680 --> 02:10:17,120
kick in the butt, and is getting overhauled.

1863
02:10:17,120 --> 02:10:20,720
But what I wanted to say, now, Dancy Stage Fusion, that is Europe's version of Ultra

1864
02:10:20,720 --> 02:10:21,720
Mix, right?

1865
02:10:21,720 --> 02:10:22,720
Correct.

1866
02:10:22,720 --> 02:10:25,360
Does this mean that DDR Hawaii could be involved?

1867
02:10:25,360 --> 02:10:26,360
DDR1?

1868
02:10:26,360 --> 02:10:27,360
DDR Hawaii.

1869
02:10:27,360 --> 02:10:28,360
Oh, DDR Hawaii?

1870
02:10:28,360 --> 02:10:29,360
Or KTH.

1871
02:10:29,360 --> 02:10:30,360
Well, usually...

1872
02:10:30,360 --> 02:10:31,360
Sorry.

1873
02:10:31,360 --> 02:10:38,480
Usually, I'm not sure about arcade mixes because as far as, I mean, as far as like say home

1874
02:10:38,480 --> 02:10:44,620
console versions, like Kset I believe does, like there's actually the AM division is different

1875
02:10:44,620 --> 02:10:46,320
than the console division.

1876
02:10:46,320 --> 02:10:50,240
So I mean, as far as like programming, all that kind of stuff, Hawaii doesn't really

1877
02:10:50,240 --> 02:10:54,280
have that much say I don't think as far as arcade releases, as far as like home version,

1878
02:10:54,280 --> 02:10:56,120
of course they got the lockdown on that.

1879
02:10:56,120 --> 02:10:57,120
Interesting.

1880
02:10:57,120 --> 02:11:02,040
Well, it will be interesting to see what happens, because a lot of people, just with the developments

1881
02:11:02,040 --> 02:11:07,120
with UltraMix II and the license, they said, you know, I've heard people say this, if DDR

1882
02:11:07,120 --> 02:11:10,160
comes out again in the USA, Hawaii needs to be involved.

1883
02:11:10,160 --> 02:11:13,640
Hawaii definitely needs to be involved, which is amazing considering that UltraMix II hasn't

1884
02:11:13,640 --> 02:11:14,640
even come out yet.

1885
02:11:14,640 --> 02:11:15,640
But, we'll see.

1886
02:11:15,640 --> 02:11:19,880
Yeah, it's, I mean, there's a lot of things going into UltraMix II that are different.

1887
02:11:19,880 --> 02:11:23,640
You know, obviously, you know, some people give, you know, Hawaii credit for, of course,

1888
02:11:23,640 --> 02:11:25,320
going kind of a slightly different direction.

1889
02:11:25,320 --> 02:11:34,320
Some people can point out to the fact that this time they got even more DDR knowledgeable people to QA and not only that, work on step data.

1890
02:11:34,320 --> 02:11:41,320
So this is very much like fans having even more, or like players having more of a say into what goes into a game.

1891
02:11:41,320 --> 02:11:51,320
If that's the direction how DDR as far as the Ultramix franchise is concerned, then it's definitely going to have its own identity very shortly.

1892
02:11:51,320 --> 02:11:54,320
People will see that as soon as they get it.

1893
02:11:54,320 --> 02:11:59,020
Very good. Alright. I guess what we're going to do now, I think now is a good time to take

1894
02:11:59,020 --> 02:12:02,360
a break, and when we come back we're going to get into the FUs of the week. So if you

1895
02:12:02,360 --> 02:12:06,860
want to send some FUs in over private message to Sky in the chat room, we will make sure

1896

The Occasional Marathon.

1940
02:17:39,040 --> 02:17:40,040
I do marathon stuff.

1941
02:17:40,040 --> 02:17:41,040
That's right.

1942
02:17:41,040 --> 02:17:44,080
Didn't you marathon Eddie Izzard the other day?

1943
02:17:44,080 --> 02:17:49,160
Last week I did the Shambad Sings again.

1944
02:17:49,160 --> 02:17:50,160
Oh yes.

1945
02:17:50,160 --> 02:17:51,680
I actually tuned in for part of that.

1946
02:17:51,680 --> 02:17:52,680
I heard some of that.

1947
02:17:52,680 --> 02:17:53,680
It was pretty good.

1948
02:17:53,680 --> 02:17:54,680
Other stuff.

1949
02:17:54,680 --> 02:17:55,680
Good stuff.

1950
02:17:55,680 --> 02:17:59,680
We're going to be now, not going to be the Orange Lounge Radio Rewind anymore since those

1951
02:17:59,680 --> 02:18:01,520
are moving over to The Freak.

1952
02:18:01,520 --> 02:18:07,160
It's going to be the classic, moldy episodes, freshly fermented for your listening pleasure,

1953
02:18:07,160 --> 02:18:10,480
year old episodes of Orange Lounge Radio.

1954
02:18:10,480 --> 02:18:17,160
And Thursday nights on this station, outside the box, my program dedicated to all that

1955
02:18:17,160 --> 02:18:18,920
other random video game stuff.

1956
02:18:18,920 --> 02:18:21,600
So definitely check it out if you haven't yet.

1957
02:18:21,600 --> 02:18:26,260
Now we must get to one of those Orange Lounge Radio Live staples, that thing we have to

1958
02:18:26,260 --> 02:18:29,760
do every week where we get out that angst, and for those of you guys that are new to

1959
02:18:29,760 --> 02:18:33,160
this program, I know there might be some of you guys that are listening to this on DER

1960
02:18:33,160 --> 02:18:36,600
Free Radio for the first time, those of you guys that are new to the program are going

1961
02:18:36,600 --> 02:18:41,680
to hear this every week, the FUs of the week, and Jamie, why is it that we have to do these

1962
02:18:41,680 --> 02:18:44,460
FUs of the week every single week?

1963
02:18:44,460 --> 02:18:48,460
Because we're not going to take it anymore.

1964
02:18:48,460 --> 02:19:08,260
The first SU goes to my allergies for flaring up, the second goes to Ben and Joel for making

1965
02:19:08,260 --> 02:19:09,260
me sleepy.

1966
02:19:09,260 --> 02:19:17,420
Also, for some reason my jaw hurts, like the joints in my jaw, yeah I've got all this

1967
02:19:17,420 --> 02:19:21,420
that is pressure in my head. That means that I'm likely going to bed early.

1968
02:19:21,420 --> 02:19:25,420
I don't drink carefully, nor do I have any at the house.

1969
02:19:25,420 --> 02:19:29,420
I have prescription drugs that are doing shit.

1970
02:19:29,420 --> 02:19:33,420
Um, but I'm probably going to be going to sleep early tonight.

1971
02:19:33,420 --> 02:19:37,420
Um, a big F-you

1972
02:19:37,420 --> 02:19:41,420
toward having to work on this ethics project.

1973
02:19:41,420 --> 02:20:05,360
p0k3smot42o

1974
02:20:05,360 --> 02:20:10,360
for being in a big feeding frenzy so that I'd trip over her while wearing clocks in the kitchen

1975
02:20:10,360 --> 02:20:12,360
last Sunday

1976
02:20:12,360 --> 02:20:18,360
and just, in general, just massive FUs to just about everything

1977
02:20:18,360 --> 02:20:21,360
I think that will cover everything

1978
02:20:21,360 --> 02:20:24,360
Alright, Loki, your turn

1979
02:20:27,360 --> 02:20:32,360
Oh my god, you know, as if I don't complain about them enough

1980
02:20:32,360 --> 02:20:39,360
Yay! You did it again, Comcast! You just find a way to fuck everything up again!

1981
02:20:39,360 --> 02:20:40,360
Way to go, G4!

1982
02:20:40,360 --> 02:20:46,360
Because you know what? There wasn't quite enough crap on there yet, so you had to get rid of the, like, good stuff.

1983
02:20:46,360 --> 02:20:48,360
You know, the fit more crap in there.

1984
02:20:48,360 --> 02:20:55,360
I'm sorry for all those people that used to be part of TechTV that got sucked into G4 and then fired.

1985
02:20:55,360 --> 02:20:57,360
Because you're talented.

1986
02:20:57,360 --> 02:21:01,360
Well, you know what? They don't want to make G4 look bad, so guess what?

1987
02:21:01,360 --> 02:21:06,520
Bye bye, bye bye screensavers, bye bye unscrewed, yeah screensavers will still be there but

1988
02:21:06,520 --> 02:21:08,960
it ain't screensavers anymore.

1989
02:21:08,960 --> 02:21:13,320
And you know what, I'm, and know what sucks too is I heard that the people, actually some

1990
02:21:13,320 --> 02:21:17,240
of the good shows on G4 like Cheat and stuff, oh those guys got fired too!

1991
02:21:17,240 --> 02:21:18,240
So guess what?

1992
02:21:18,240 --> 02:21:22,800
You know, the hell with all the good stuff on G4, I will not be watching G4 anymore unless

1993
02:21:22,800 --> 02:21:27,440
to catch the last episode of Unscrewed if they ever air it, that'll be the only time

1994
02:21:27,440 --> 02:21:29,320
and the last time I watch G4.

1995
02:21:29,320 --> 02:21:34,240
So fuck you guys, cause you just fucked everything up, you took the only station I actually liked

1996
02:21:34,240 --> 02:21:39,520
that felt like a station for me, and you just took a giant crap on it, so you know what?

1997
02:21:39,520 --> 02:21:46,080
Fuck you guys, and when I see you at E3, I'm fucking taking you down, social unrest, that's

1998
02:21:46,080 --> 02:21:49,420
what it will be, so anyway, so fuck them.

1999
02:21:49,420 --> 02:21:54,640
Thank you Loki for destroying any possible opportunity we ever had of taking Orange Lounge

2000
02:21:54,640 --> 02:21:57,560
TV on the air, thank you.

2001
02:21:57,560 --> 02:22:03,680
listen listen I'm not gonna want to be associated with anything on that station

2002
02:22:03,680 --> 02:22:09,320
because that you know it just does not have enough halo in that show so no

2003
02:22:09,320 --> 02:22:15,480
anyway so fuck them and fuck my headache because it sucks but it's starting to go

2004
02:22:15,480 --> 02:22:20,280
away so that's kind of good fuck Grand Theft Auto San Andreas and more

2005
02:22:20,280 --> 02:22:26,400
specifically the woozy mo mission I can't fucking beat it it's annoying why

2006
02:22:26,400 --> 02:22:31,020
Why does anyone, okay, why do street racers, Japanese street racers come to town to have

2007
02:22:31,020 --> 02:22:33,080
an off-road street race?

2008
02:22:33,080 --> 02:22:36,600
I'm sorry, but, you know, people that drive, you know, those racers don't drive off-road,

2009
02:22:36,600 --> 02:22:37,600
okay?

2010
02:22:37,600 --> 02:22:41,720
The racers were not made for off-road, so why do they have a race that goes off-road?

2011
02:22:41,720 --> 02:22:43,280
That sucks.

2012
02:22:43,280 --> 02:22:49,640
And um, finally, fuck you getting the G4 because you suck.

2013
02:22:49,640 --> 02:22:50,760
I hate you.

2014
02:22:50,760 --> 02:22:51,760
I hate you.

2015
02:22:51,760 --> 02:22:52,760
I hate you.

2016
02:22:52,760 --> 02:22:53,760
I hate you.

2017
02:22:53,760 --> 02:23:07,760
I just want to give a special message to Comcast, you know what, despite what Loki says, I will

2018
02:23:07,760 --> 02:23:14,080
still sell out faster than Divine Brown, okay? I just want you to know, and I have this great

2019
02:23:14,080 --> 02:23:19,880
concept, I have this wonderful concept for a gay gaming show, we could call it gamers,

2020
02:23:19,880 --> 02:23:25,960
about it. Think about it. You want me, you know you do. I would take Jamie with me. Loki

2021
02:23:25,960 --> 02:23:29,160
gets left behind, though, after that remark. Does that mean that you have to have the hag

2022
02:23:29,160 --> 02:23:36,160
co-host? Yes, you would be my official fag-hag co-host. Cool. All right. And Loki can polish

2023
02:23:38,360 --> 02:23:42,760
my shoes for all I care. All right. Anyway, on to my FUs, my actual FUs. You could be

2024
02:23:42,760 --> 02:23:48,360
the angry hetero guy in the corner. Yeah. My FUs go to being sick, because I've been

2025
02:23:48,360 --> 02:23:53,580
very sick all weekend and it sucks because remember I was sitting here last week and

2026
02:23:53,580 --> 02:23:57,000
I took a poll how many people were sick and half the people were sick and I said gee the

2027
02:23:57,000 --> 02:24:01,100
rest of us feel like we just got a death sentence like we're waiting to get sick sure enough

2028
02:24:01,100 --> 02:24:05,120
I got sick it wasn't quite as bad like I think the strain kind of got weaker as it went along

2029
02:24:05,120 --> 02:24:10,360
so I can't bitch too much but being sick still sucks I just want to get that out there but

2030
02:24:10,360 --> 02:24:15,680
what I really want to say on FU too is F you to those guys on Halo 2 oh my god I got invited

2031
02:24:15,680 --> 02:24:20,240
into this match on Xbox Live one of my friends somebody on my friends list on

2032
02:24:20,240 --> 02:24:23,040
Xbox you know how like the people on your friends list you sometimes don't

2033
02:24:23,040 --> 02:24:27,040
know him that well well I had one of these guys then he invited me into his

2034
02:24:27,040 --> 02:24:29,760
game and he had like all these experts in there and I guess they were having

2035
02:24:29,760 --> 02:24:33,720
tryouts for their clan and for some reason they wanted me to try out for

2036
02:24:33,720 --> 02:24:38,540
their clan well like we were playing one of those team games it was king of the

2037
02:24:38,540 --> 02:24:42,040
hill and I never played that version before so I didn't know what I was doing

2038
02:24:42,040 --> 02:24:44,040
and my teammates were yelling at me and they were like

2039
02:24:44,040 --> 02:24:45,040
DON'T YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

2040
02:24:45,040 --> 02:24:47,040
COME ON GREEN SKY WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU?

2041
02:24:47,040 --> 02:24:48,040
WHAT IS THIS?

2042
02:24:48,040 --> 02:24:50,040
And I'm just like, I wanted to cry

2043
02:24:50,040 --> 02:24:53,040
I was just like, they're yelling at me and they're being mean to me

2044
02:24:53,040 --> 02:24:55,040
I don't know what I'm doing, fuck your clan

2045
02:24:55,040 --> 02:24:56,040
Rob

2046
02:24:56,040 --> 02:24:59,040
You guys are the Clu Clucks clan right now, that's who you guys are

2047
02:24:59,040 --> 02:25:00,040
Rob

2048
02:25:00,040 --> 02:25:01,040
What?

2049
02:25:01,040 --> 02:25:03,040
You need to join the clan that Dan's in, the fuckers

2050
02:25:03,040 --> 02:25:05,040
Okay, I'll join that

2051
02:25:05,040 --> 02:25:07,040
Are they gonna yell at me if I screw up?

2052
02:25:07,040 --> 02:25:10,040
Probably not, probably half of them will be drunk

2053
02:25:10,040 --> 02:25:18,040
After that match, Flair O'Nai, one of our listeners, invited me into one of his matches, and I blew him up a bunch with a rocket, and that made me feel better.

2054
02:25:18,040 --> 02:25:20,040
So thank you, Flair O'Nai, for letting me take my aggressions out on you.

2055
02:25:20,040 --> 02:25:28,040
That's it. F you to assholes on Halo 2, and F you to people on Xbox Live that when you sign on to the game, they go,

2056
02:25:28,040 --> 02:25:31,040
MEGA MEGA MEGA MEGA MEGA MEGA MEGA MEGA, because they think it makes them look cool.

2057
02:25:31,040 --> 02:25:35,040
FYI, it doesn't. Grow up. Thank you.

2058
02:25:35,040 --> 02:25:41,600
Moving on, let's see what our other guests in the studio have to say, starting with Float

2059
02:25:41,600 --> 02:25:42,600
Walk.

2060
02:25:42,600 --> 02:25:52,440
Oh, sorry, we can't hear you, turn on the mic.

2061
02:25:52,440 --> 02:25:53,440
There you go.

2062
02:25:53,440 --> 02:25:54,440
Damn, I have no idea.

2063
02:25:54,440 --> 02:25:55,440
There you go.

2064
02:25:55,440 --> 02:25:56,440
Sorry about that.

2065
02:25:56,440 --> 02:25:57,440
Okay.

2066
02:25:57,440 --> 02:26:01,600
Well, it's a pretty tame week of FUs for me, although probably the one right now I'm thinking

2067
02:26:01,600 --> 02:26:07,600
more than anything is. F you to, uh, Konami Digital Entertainment America QA department.

2068
02:26:07,600 --> 02:26:14,000
Uh, thanks for laying me off a lot earlier before the game even passed, you know. I mean,

2069
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:17,320
I'll probably get help for even saying it, but there's some things you don't do. You

2070
02:26:17,320 --> 02:26:21,240
don't spit in the wind, you don't tug on Superman's cape, and you don't break up a team before

2071
02:26:21,240 --> 02:26:27,400
the game goes gold. I'll leave it at that, and I think, uh, Mr. Miklotov can totally

2072
02:26:27,400 --> 02:26:32,200
get me off I can't back me up on that one so uh yes I'll leave it very short

2073
02:26:32,200 --> 02:26:38,320
like that before I really go off well I think we'll just move right along to

2074
02:26:38,320 --> 02:26:46,320
explicit one of the biggest F you hate six inches from mouth all right try

2075
02:26:46,320 --> 02:26:53,560
again okay okay yes much better all right I'd like to say a big F you to

2076
02:26:53,560 --> 02:27:00,560
some old guy who rear-ended my fucking car! Oh wow! You rear-ended my car!

2077
02:27:02,800 --> 02:27:08,920
What the hell? Jamie's trying to nap, so you gotta turn it

2078
02:27:08,920 --> 02:27:11,640
down a notch, that's alright. I'm sorry for being so loud, but I was very

2079
02:27:11,640 --> 02:27:17,960
pissed off with the old fart who rear-ended my car and it was this far from moving back.

2080
02:27:17,960 --> 02:27:24,080
I moved out first, so it gets me priority to go first, and the fact that you just went

2081
02:27:24,080 --> 02:27:31,400
like around 20 miles an hour backing up, just cuz you drive an SUV does not mean shit.

2082
02:27:31,400 --> 02:27:37,880
There was no scratches in your car, yet you left a big ass dent in my Toyota Corolla 2004S

2083
02:27:37,880 --> 02:27:43,400
server, now it looks all ugly as hell and I have to pay 200 bucks.

2084
02:27:43,400 --> 02:27:50,200
Now I have to pay 200 bucks off my own money just to get that shit fixed.

2085
02:27:50,200 --> 02:27:54,760
And just because you said, oh, I'm sorry, and run away like it's a hit and run with

2086
02:27:54,760 --> 02:28:01,400
a bunch of cops around doesn't mean I'm going to let you go saying, I forgive you just because

2087
02:28:01,400 --> 02:28:02,400
you built my car.

2088
02:28:02,400 --> 02:28:03,400
Well, guess what?

2089
02:28:03,400 --> 02:28:06,400
I'm on your ass whenever I see you.

2090
02:28:06,400 --> 02:28:13,320
Okay, enough with the FUs with the car because I'll pay that shit up in a few minutes.

2091
02:28:13,320 --> 02:28:15,280
few weeks and stuff

2092
02:28:15,280 --> 02:28:21,560
okay another f he goes to people playing Halo 2 multiplayer

2093
02:28:21,560 --> 02:28:26,560
no certain people, certain people

2094
02:28:26,560 --> 02:28:27,280
alright

2095
02:28:27,280 --> 02:28:31,600
just cause you're touching my balls doesn't mean i'm distracted

2096
02:28:31,600 --> 02:28:35,440
why wait i didn't realize this was a feature in Halo 2

2097
02:28:35,440 --> 02:28:39,400
wait a minute wait a minute

2098
02:28:39,400 --> 02:28:42,280
yeah we see people try to cheat in Halo 2

2099
02:28:42,280 --> 02:28:44,920
So you know what people do in Halo 2?

2100
02:28:44,920 --> 02:28:48,920
Like, if you have four people around, like, what?

2101
02:28:48,920 --> 02:28:52,160
Sorry, I...

2102
02:28:52,160 --> 02:28:55,920
Okay, no. Sorry, sorry, we're doing something else over here. It's a funny, funny picture on a website.

2103
02:28:55,920 --> 02:28:57,120
Ooh, it's interesting.

2104
02:28:57,120 --> 02:29:00,840
So yeah, F you to people who are trying to cheat in Halo 2.

2105
02:29:00,840 --> 02:29:03,200
Yeah, punching people in the face.

2106
02:29:03,200 --> 02:29:08,080
Just try to win a game. It's just a damn game, yo. If you're getting your ass kicked,

2107
02:29:08,080 --> 02:29:09,640
just take the heat.

2108
02:29:09,640 --> 02:29:10,680
There's no need to

2109
02:29:10,680 --> 02:29:14,040
touch people, just touch people, touch people on the balls

2110
02:29:14,040 --> 02:29:16,680
for a sub-sexual desire that you guys have

2111
02:29:16,680 --> 02:29:18,840
and no, I'm not like that, so

2112
02:29:18,840 --> 02:29:21,920
if it was a female, that'd be cool

2113
02:29:21,920 --> 02:29:22,800
okay

2114
02:29:22,800 --> 02:29:24,520
well, speaking of females

2115
02:29:24,520 --> 02:29:32,320
I'd like to say another F you to this one stripper who fucking knee-dropped my...

2116
02:29:32,320 --> 02:29:34,480
yeah, she, yeah

2117
02:29:34,480 --> 02:29:39,180
during Gold Clubs 34, I paid twenty bucks for a few lap dances

2118
02:29:39,180 --> 02:29:41,180
It was this kind of 2 by the way, so I guess...

2119
02:29:45,180 --> 02:29:53,180
It was a cool rap dance and all, but the fact that she acted like a knee drop, like, oops!

2120
02:29:55,180 --> 02:29:57,180
I like tuned out for a second, what the hell?

2121
02:29:57,180 --> 02:30:01,180
This is what you get when we're looking at funny pictures of Sephiroth killing Aerith.

2122
02:30:01,180 --> 02:30:04,180
But they have, they have, we're gonna put it up on the TV so you guys can see it.

2123
02:30:04,180 --> 02:30:22,180
I just posted in the chatroom. Somebody made a signature on the G4 TechTV form. It's Sephiroth, and he has a G4 logo where his face should be, and there's an heiress with a TechTV logo where her face should be, and it's the scene where Sephiroth is about to kill her.

2124
02:30:22,180 --> 02:30:33,180
Yeah, I think the only thing about the stripper needing you in the, like, gonads for the lapdance, I think she noticed that, you know, if you try to get lapdances on a discount, she's gonna be a little miffed too, man.

2125
02:30:33,180 --> 02:30:38,180
Alright. Well, I could've been the mess from the situation.

2126
02:30:38,180 --> 02:30:40,180
Alright, it's a three-hour show. Can I move on now?

2127
02:30:40,180 --> 02:30:42,180
Maybe she was looking, man.

2128
02:30:42,180 --> 02:30:49,180
Well, it's a fact that she has a male name. Her name's Bradley.

2129
02:30:49,180 --> 02:30:51,820
holding anyway can move on to the month

2130
02:30:51,820 --> 02:30:54,380
well who were put out by a real

2131
02:30:54,380 --> 02:30:56,920
chair of that you've got

2132
02:30:56,920 --> 02:31:00,240
presented by you guys which i remember debbie debbie debbie dot uh... orange

2133
02:31:00,240 --> 02:31:02,000
laundry a compliment that

2134
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:03,800
the entire it says

2135
02:31:03,800 --> 02:31:07,600
after you to school not enough time in the day and not having a car license in

2136
02:31:07,600 --> 02:31:11,660
life going a little too fast for me i don't want to grow up

2137
02:31:11,660 --> 02:31:13,580
he has held out the i said

2138
02:31:13,580 --> 02:31:14,880
i heart him

2139
02:31:14,880 --> 02:31:16,340
uh... i thought

2140
02:31:16,340 --> 02:31:18,800
i thought that i was too far

2141
02:31:18,800 --> 02:31:23,580
I know, you're trying to suck up to me because you want to pass it to E3 next year. Don't worry, I got you covered like a Jimmy hat.

2142
02:31:23,580 --> 02:31:26,860
Fucking fanboys.

2143
02:31:26,860 --> 02:31:28,600
Just kidding.

2144
02:31:28,600 --> 02:31:34,600
Actually, if Mel can get me into E3 again, I'll be all up on him, just like the fanboy.

2145
02:31:34,600 --> 02:31:36,820
Not like, up on him.

2146
02:31:36,820 --> 02:31:38,100
But, you know.

2147
02:31:38,100 --> 02:31:38,940
I know.

2148
02:31:38,940 --> 02:31:40,700
Kind of like when you call me a brother.

2149
02:31:40,700 --> 02:31:46,700
You know, not the way, like, we mean in a biological sense, but the way black people talk to each other.

2150
02:31:49,700 --> 02:31:51,700
Anyway, DarklionXVI says,

2151
02:31:51,700 --> 02:31:55,700
F you to annoying tourists who keep on bugging players just for them to look stupid.

2152
02:31:55,700 --> 02:31:59,700
Last night at the Adventure Dome, I had to move a black guy off the Player 2 DR pad

2153
02:31:59,700 --> 02:32:03,700
because he was distracting a friend of mine while playing The Legend of Max this extra stage.

2154
02:32:03,700 --> 02:32:07,700
F you to myself for going to a debut party last week, ending up doing nothing at all.

2155
02:32:07,700 --> 02:32:14,700
Legend of Zaku says, F you to my little brother for running up almost $30 in overages at the

2156
02:32:14,700 --> 02:32:18,380
wireless bill this month. F you to Leisure Time bowling alley and Port Authority bus

2157
02:32:18,380 --> 02:32:22,620
terminal in New York City for being assholes by trashing there in the groove for a second

2158
02:32:22,620 --> 02:32:23,620
extreme machine.

2159
02:32:23,620 --> 02:32:27,700
Yay, score one for the good guys.

2160
02:32:27,700 --> 02:32:35,740
Dark Tetsuya says, F you to, surprise surprise, Comcast for taking a giant crap on G4TechTV.

2161
02:32:35,740 --> 02:32:41,680
DD Archaholic says, F you to people who think that there are hot guys in video games.

2162
02:32:41,680 --> 02:32:44,800
I may not play a lot of video games myself, but I'm pretty sure there are no hot guys

2163
02:32:44,800 --> 02:32:45,800
in them.

2164
02:32:45,800 --> 02:32:48,280
Big ol' sweaty rowdy rowdy Piper is not a hot guy.

2165
02:32:48,280 --> 02:32:53,680
He does not make me moist with his chest pounding, nor does his ugly Cro-Magnon man head or his

2166
02:32:53,680 --> 02:32:57,840
butt crack, which is pinched shut due to the vice grip power of his gluteus maxi, make

2167
02:32:57,840 --> 02:32:59,480
my nipples hard.

2168
02:32:59,480 --> 02:33:01,540
Antonio Banderas is a hot hot guy.

2169
02:33:01,540 --> 02:33:04,500
He is not in video games, no monsieur.

2170
02:33:04,500 --> 02:33:08,260
And F you if you think that complaining about the lack of hot guys in the media is a sad

2171
02:33:08,260 --> 02:33:16,540
pursuit because your continuous excitement of bouncing boobies is itself a sad pursuit.

2172
02:33:16,540 --> 02:33:17,540
So there.

2173
02:33:17,540 --> 02:33:18,540
Suck my titty.

2174
02:33:18,540 --> 02:33:19,540
Hallo.

2175
02:33:19,540 --> 02:33:20,540
Wow.

2176
02:33:20,540 --> 02:33:27,740
Iguana Girl says, a lovely F you to idiots who think they can talk their way out of warning

2177
02:33:27,740 --> 02:33:30,620
points for flame bait.

2178
02:33:30,620 --> 02:33:35,360
They're coming to get you.

2179
02:33:35,360 --> 02:33:37,880
Failed.

2180
02:33:37,880 --> 02:33:42,200
Dark Knight has one FU tonight and that's to torment I'm going to be facing at work

2181
02:33:42,200 --> 02:33:43,880
here from on out.

2182
02:33:43,880 --> 02:33:47,880
Note, I work at for a retail store, need I say more?

2183
02:33:47,880 --> 02:33:53,440
So, he works at a retail store therefore this is not going to be a happy fun time of year

2184
02:33:53,440 --> 02:33:54,440
for him.

2185
02:33:54,440 --> 02:34:00,120
Q says F you to Halo 2 for making it almost impossible to get an Xbox and

2186
02:34:00,120 --> 02:34:05,360
Misty says fuck me for sleeping until 6 central and having to get to work at 5

2187
02:34:05,360 --> 02:34:10,640
I doubt I'll be getting any sleep tonight that's it for our chat room F

2188
02:34:10,640 --> 02:34:19,240
use whoo all right very colorful F use from all you guys thank you all right

2189
02:34:19,240 --> 02:34:23,760
all right we're gonna do now is we're gonna go to break in this break we're

2190
02:34:23,760 --> 02:34:28,480
going to hear another brand new long version of an UltraMix 2 song. I think this time we're

2191
02:34:28,480 --> 02:34:32,340
going to do a group that's already been announced actually. You already kind of knew they were

2192
02:34:32,340 --> 02:34:37,460
in UltraMix 2 with a song called C Squared because it was on the V-rare. They have another

2193
02:34:37,460 --> 02:34:42,300
song in DDR UltraMix as well that was announced on the website and it's called Mellow and

2194
02:34:42,300 --> 02:34:49,140
the group is Alien number 613. For whatever it's worth, whatever. Oh man, all I can say

2195
02:34:49,140 --> 02:34:52,140
And yeah, again, Miklotov can get me back on this one.

2196
02:34:52,140 --> 02:34:54,140
What a pain this was to work on.

2197
02:34:54,140 --> 02:34:56,140
Oh shit, I missed an FU. Oh man.

2198
02:34:56,140 --> 02:34:59,140
And I see here Miklotov, it's his FU, he's pissed at me.

2199
02:34:59,140 --> 02:35:00,140
See, ain't I handy.

2200
02:35:00,140 --> 02:35:02,140
Hold on, hold on.

2201
02:35:02,140 --> 02:35:04,140
Let me get the FU music again.

2202
02:35:04,140 --> 02:35:06,140
You feel all special.

2203
02:35:08,140 --> 02:35:12,140
Miklotov says FU to Halo 2 for not saving my damn progress.

2204
02:35:12,140 --> 02:35:14,140
Now I have to play this fucking level again.

2205
02:35:14,140 --> 02:35:15,140
Who on you Halo 2?

2206
02:35:15,140 --> 02:35:20,180
too. F you to people who don't realize Drawn Together is one of the hottest shows ever.

2207
02:35:20,180 --> 02:35:24,140
It sounds like a horrible idea for a show, and it is, but it's the best thing on Comedy

2208
02:35:24,140 --> 02:35:31,140
Central since Strangers with Candy. I love you, Xander.

2209
02:35:31,140 --> 02:35:47,420
Alright, sorry Mikotov, I just, your window for some reason didn't show up as red, because

2210
02:35:47,420 --> 02:35:49,980
you were sending the other messages earlier, that's why.

2211
02:35:49,980 --> 02:35:55,180
Anyway, let's get to the break, alright, as I promised, alien number 613 in the song is

2212
02:35:55,180 --> 02:36:02,180
called Mellow. Enjoy.

2213
02:36:25,180 --> 02:36:27,180
Oh

2214
02:37:55,180 --> 02:37:57,180
Oh

2215
02:39:25,180 --> 02:39:36,540
Hello? Hello, is this thing on testing? Testing one, two?

2216
02:39:36,540 --> 02:39:40,580
I'm looking in the index, but I don't see anything for how to run a radio show.

2217
02:39:40,580 --> 02:39:44,620
Hello? I don't understand this. Does this thing work?

2218
02:39:44,620 --> 02:39:46,980
This thing reads like stereo instructions. Is this on?

2219
02:39:46,980 --> 02:39:53,300
What the hell? Orange Lounge Radio. Broke down ghetto bimani

2220
02:39:53,300 --> 02:40:00,180
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio. We're going to do some Ask Orange Lounge. We're

2221
02:40:00,180 --> 02:40:03,820
going to wind down this episode with some Ask Orange Lounge. So please, send in your

2222
02:40:03,820 --> 02:40:08,900
questions over private message to Sky and let me put that in the chat room too so that

2223
02:40:08,900 --> 02:40:16,100
they can do that. There you go. And also, we'll open up the Skype line for you guys

2224
02:40:16,100 --> 02:40:19,380
if you have anything you want to comment on over the Skype line because I know we haven't

2225
02:40:19,380 --> 02:40:22,780
gotten to talk to all you guys yet tonight. Again, if you want more information on the

2226
02:40:22,780 --> 02:40:27,960
the skifline, visit www.orangelaungeradio.com and click on interact with us. Yes, Loki?

2227
02:40:27,960 --> 02:40:34,260
I would like to take this moment to talk about the wonderful show called Drawn Together.

2228
02:40:34,260 --> 02:40:39,460
I watched today the first two episodes twice, and I have to say it's the fucking, it is

2229
02:40:39,460 --> 02:40:45,520
on par, if not better, than the Family Guy, and that was way up there. Okay, hold on,

2230
02:40:45,520 --> 02:40:50,880
We're getting a call. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2231
02:40:50,880 --> 02:40:52,760
Hi. Hello.

2232
02:40:52,760 --> 02:40:57,760
Turn down the speaker volume in your house.

2233
02:40:57,760 --> 02:41:01,700
Hi, we can barely hear you, but we can hear ourselves echoing. Turn down your

2234
02:41:01,700 --> 02:41:03,160
in-studio volume there.

2235
02:41:03,160 --> 02:41:04,900
The first rule of radio.

2236
02:41:04,900 --> 02:41:08,480
Turn down your WIN app or whatever. Turn down your external volume.

2237
02:41:08,480 --> 02:41:09,680
Hello.

2238
02:41:09,680 --> 02:41:11,080
Hi, who's this?

2239
02:41:11,080 --> 02:41:14,100
This is MPQ. Hi, MPQ. What's on your mind?

2240
02:41:14,100 --> 02:41:21,100
I was wondering if you could get, uh, Pop Music 5 into rotation, because, um, well I like the music in Pop Music 5.

2241
02:41:21,100 --> 02:41:26,100
Um, Pop Music 5 music, certainly, I thought we already had a couple songs in there in rotation. What, any songs in-

2242
02:41:26,100 --> 02:41:27,100
I didn't hear any.

2243
02:41:27,100 --> 02:41:29,100
Any songs in particular you're looking for?

2244
02:41:29,100 --> 02:41:39,100
I'm not sure the exact, exact titles, I think Tempura Brothers, uh, Susiliana, they're Japanese titles that, that, it's in there somewhere.

2245
02:41:39,100 --> 02:41:48,100
You know what I'll do? I will have our resident Poppin' Music whore, Navi, take a look at the soundtrack and tell me what I need to add, and we'll put some tracks and rotation just for you, my friend.

2246
02:41:48,100 --> 02:41:50,100
Thanks. That's cool.

2247
02:41:50,100 --> 02:41:52,100
No problem. Anything else you want to comment on?

2248
02:41:52,100 --> 02:41:54,100
Not really.

2249
02:41:54,100 --> 02:41:56,100
Are you liking the Bimani Music and More program otherwise?

2250
02:41:56,100 --> 02:41:58,100
Yeah, I like Bimani Music.

2251
02:41:58,100 --> 02:42:00,100
Good. Good to hear. All right, well, bud, thanks for calling.

2252
02:42:00,100 --> 02:42:01,100
All right.

2253
02:42:01,100 --> 02:42:02,100
Have a good one.

2254
02:42:02,100 --> 02:42:03,100
Have a good one.

2255
02:42:03,100 --> 02:42:04,100
Shit.

2256
02:42:04,100 --> 02:42:09,500
Well that's one way to get your way, to call one of the hosts mid-show and demand it.

2257
02:42:09,500 --> 02:42:13,380
No, but popping music is a little bit under-represented, I'll give it that.

2258
02:42:13,380 --> 02:42:14,600
We don't have enough tracks.

2259
02:42:14,600 --> 02:42:18,060
So I will go talk to the resident popping music horror and see what needs to be added

2260
02:42:18,060 --> 02:42:19,060
from the old ones.

2261
02:42:19,060 --> 02:42:23,500
Shit, if you want to talk about a game that hasn't changed since day one, popping music?

2262
02:42:23,500 --> 02:42:25,060
Holy crap!

2263
02:42:25,060 --> 02:42:26,660
Why is that game so popular?

2264
02:42:26,660 --> 02:42:27,660
That's what I want to know.

2265
02:42:27,660 --> 02:42:28,660
Ah, buttons!

2266
02:42:28,660 --> 02:42:29,660
I hit the buttons!

2267
02:42:29,660 --> 02:42:30,660
Fun!

2268
02:42:30,660 --> 02:42:31,660
Japanese?

2269
02:42:31,660 --> 02:42:33,860
JAPANESE MUSIC, COOL!

2270
02:42:33,860 --> 02:42:34,780
I mean, it's just...

2271
02:42:34,780 --> 02:42:37,780
No, that game does not appeal to me at all. It's like...

2272
02:42:37,780 --> 02:42:40,700
It's like 2DX for retards, I mean...

2273
02:42:40,700 --> 02:42:44,540
It's just the big buttons. But, you know, hey, I guess there's a demographic out there for, you know,

2274
02:42:44,540 --> 02:42:46,540
retarded 2DX players, so...

2275
02:42:46,540 --> 02:42:50,500
Hey, if you want to play... It's like playing 2DX with boxing gloves, you know? If you want to do that,

2276
02:42:50,500 --> 02:42:55,820
so be it. I mean, it's cool. It's cool because it gets crazy and stuff, but, you know,

2277
02:42:55,820 --> 02:42:59,800
they just really haven't changed anything with that game. They have not changed much.

2278
02:42:59,800 --> 02:43:12,800
But here I am, the uninformed pop music person, because I don't play pop music, and I tried playing pop music, and it just did not appeal to me, but for some reason I'm still putting pop music in my cabinet, so I'll give it another go later.

2279
02:43:12,800 --> 02:43:14,800
Yeah, you take the good, you take the bad.

2280
02:43:14,800 --> 02:43:16,800
Yeah, whatever. Anyway.

2281
02:43:16,800 --> 02:43:20,800
You take them both, and there you have the facts of the life, the facts of the life.

2282
02:43:20,800 --> 02:43:24,880
Whatever happened to that Simphile contest we were gonna do like a while back on the show?

2283
02:43:25,400 --> 02:43:32,820
Remember we were gonna have the Orange Lounge Radio response to Simphile contest and we were gonna have the all TV show Simphile theme

2284
02:43:37,160 --> 02:43:38,440
Yeah, I know

2285
02:43:38,440 --> 02:43:40,040
They can do tournaments shit

2286
02:43:40,040 --> 02:43:44,620
I mean we could give away we could give away sign to Kiryamoka CDs for God's sakes people would enter for that

2287
02:43:45,360 --> 02:43:48,520
DVDs in my room. I know seriously we didn't have more contests

2288
02:43:48,520 --> 02:43:55,520
I still have like 30 Max2 viewers at my place if anyone wants them.

2289
02:43:55,520 --> 02:43:58,520
Let's just start giving away like candy, hey.

2290
02:43:58,520 --> 02:44:02,520
Dude, that's like all we do at like DDR sponsored tournaments.

2291
02:44:02,520 --> 02:44:08,520
There you go. Alright.

2292
02:44:08,520 --> 02:44:17,520
Alright, let's get into a favorite segment here on this program which we haven't done in quite some time.

2293
02:44:17,520 --> 02:44:21,840
sticking with us for a walk? Yeah, what the hell, I'll stay here till the end. All right,

2294
02:44:21,840 --> 02:44:26,760
that's a real trooper there. Yeah, you know, hell, sleep's overrated I guess. Yeah, that's

2295
02:44:26,760 --> 02:44:38,120
right. All right, here we go. That's only 15 more minutes. Let's ask Orange Lounge some

2296
02:44:38,120 --> 02:44:43,900
stupid question. What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio? Since it's been

2297
02:44:43,900 --> 02:44:49,700
few weeks since we've had a segment I expect there to be lots of questions or

2298
02:44:49,700 --> 02:45:01,260
else all right here's a real winner this questions from legend of Zaku I love

2299
02:45:01,260 --> 02:45:04,980
this question this is what this is why I missed the ask orange lounge segment

2300
02:45:04,980 --> 02:45:08,820
because remember you can ask us about the money you can ask us about whatever

2301
02:45:08,820 --> 02:45:13,540
the hell you want and this definitely falls into the latter legend of Zaku

2302
02:45:13,540 --> 02:45:20,260
says being a person of Hispanic descent how come white girls like and have a

2303
02:45:20,260 --> 02:45:26,900
thing for Hispanic guys dude ask Eddie Guerrero from the WWE it's all about

2304
02:45:26,900 --> 02:45:32,800
Latino he just burst into the room one for whatever from where this is all of

2305
02:45:32,800 --> 02:45:46,560
us do hey man you want to see my Aztec warrior got a love next Friday hi papi

2306
02:45:49,560 --> 02:45:53,560
that has to be one of those retarded questions I've ever heard in my life

2307
02:45:53,560 --> 02:46:00,880
so generalized I personally maybe in his neck of the woods but in general I'm

2308
02:46:00,880 --> 02:46:07,120
I'm sorry, no offense. I've dated a few Hispanic guys, but most in general, I've not had very

2309
02:46:07,120 --> 02:46:16,440
good experiences with. I have a lot of friends. I've dated a few guys, but in general, I haven't

2310
02:46:16,440 --> 02:46:21,240
had a very good experience in a romantic relationship with Hispanic men.

2311
02:46:21,240 --> 02:46:25,680
I dated a Hispanic guy once. It was a nice date. Son of a bitch never called me back,

2312
02:46:25,680 --> 02:46:28,240
but it was a nice date.

2313
02:46:28,240 --> 02:46:31,500
i think probably the fact that i have a hispanic last name you know

2314
02:46:31,500 --> 02:46:33,540
i could be a hard drive

2315
02:46:33,540 --> 02:46:37,140
by two wonder why all the white chicks dig me too

2316
02:46:37,140 --> 02:46:38,300
uh...

2317
02:46:38,300 --> 02:46:43,080
i can't i can't answer this question without going like a racist

2318
02:46:43,080 --> 02:46:47,680
uh... let's move on to the second question that

2319
02:46:47,680 --> 02:46:50,080
uh... let's see jazz

2320
02:46:50,080 --> 02:46:53,500
well this is a good question have any of you guys play technic beat

2321
02:46:53,500 --> 02:46:56,500
and if so what do you think of it this is a brand new game that came out from i

2322
02:46:56,500 --> 02:46:57,820
believe namco

2323
02:46:57,820 --> 02:47:00,460
did it and it's another one of their bargain basement games like i'd like to

2324
02:47:00,460 --> 02:47:04,040
buy she had heard a lot of great things about it but i think i had a more to pay

2325
02:47:04,040 --> 02:47:06,580
i've seen pictures

2326
02:47:06,580 --> 02:47:09,900
well i haven't read it i've seen pictures of what's interesting but i

2327
02:47:09,900 --> 02:47:13,580
haven't waited i've heard very very good things about it and i like well of

2328
02:47:13,580 --> 02:47:18,180
reports of something i like it's on my to-do list because it it is you know we

2329
02:47:18,180 --> 02:47:21,540
want to cut all the time i think you were you the alien that noise people

2330
02:47:21,540 --> 02:47:23,160
sound of the uh...

2331
02:47:23,160 --> 02:47:25,560
uh... below the uh... under the skin

2332
02:47:25,560 --> 02:47:26,560
under the skin.

2333
02:47:26,560 --> 02:47:27,560
But that has nothing to do with Technic Beat.

2334
02:47:27,560 --> 02:47:28,560
I know.

2335
02:47:28,560 --> 02:47:29,560
Quick change to the subject.

2336
02:47:29,560 --> 02:47:30,560
Alright.

2337
02:47:30,560 --> 02:47:33,280
But yeah, Technic Beat, I'm looking forward to it.

2338
02:47:33,280 --> 02:47:35,800
I've heard a lot of great things about it, unfortunately, I have not had a chance to

2339
02:47:35,800 --> 02:47:36,800
play it yet.

2340
02:47:36,800 --> 02:47:39,720
I haven't seen it anywhere, strangely enough.

2341
02:47:39,720 --> 02:47:41,560
I didn't even realize it was out until I went onto a website.

2342
02:47:41,560 --> 02:47:44,560
I was looking for under the skin the last time I was at the mall.

2343
02:47:44,560 --> 02:47:45,560
Nothing.

2344
02:47:45,560 --> 02:47:46,560
Alright.

2345
02:47:46,560 --> 02:47:50,560
Technic Beat, we will check it out as soon as we can.

2346
02:47:50,560 --> 02:47:53,080
Don't we still need to get Karaoke Revolution 3?

2347
02:47:53,080 --> 02:47:54,080
Yes we do.

2348
02:47:54,080 --> 02:47:55,080
Thank you for reminding me.

2349
02:47:55,080 --> 02:48:00,120
I'm hoping I want to I want to invite a guana girl back on the show so we can do our duet to love shack

2350
02:48:00,120 --> 02:48:03,920
Live on air on revolution 3. I hope she'll be down for it. So

2351
02:48:04,720 --> 02:48:06,720
And then we're gonna make you angry

2352
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:09,000
So very ronery

2353
02:48:10,800 --> 02:48:12,800
All right

2354
02:48:13,920 --> 02:48:18,920
Dd. Archaholic says when you guys are not playing the money games. What other toys do you like?

2355
02:48:18,920 --> 02:48:26,920
Mike, mine come from a store called Goldies which is located on 16th, nevermind, I'm kidding.

2356
02:48:26,920 --> 02:48:32,920
I don't know, I don't have any toys in the living room that might be displaying video or anything like that.

2357
02:48:32,920 --> 02:48:34,920
I have my computer.

2358
02:48:34,920 --> 02:48:42,920
I have my computer, my turntables, my cabinet, my game systems, my portal to hell device.

2359
02:48:42,920 --> 02:48:47,920
I don't need toys, I have a man I can climb all over.

2360
02:48:47,920 --> 02:48:54,920
kostjamrh And that has been a journey into the TMI Zone.

2361
02:49:17,920 --> 02:49:23,920
And of course Yu-Gi-Oh cards, which I toss around nowadays, and that's really about it.

2362
02:49:23,920 --> 02:49:25,920
I'm kind of out going to toy things.

2363
02:49:25,920 --> 02:49:27,920
Except I still play with bobbleheads.

2364
02:49:27,920 --> 02:49:30,920
Do you miss Kyle Snyder as a worthy opponent at Yu-Gi-Oh?

2365
02:49:30,920 --> 02:49:36,920
Oh my God, totally. Where else would you get a totally great duel, along with color commentary on the side?

2366
02:49:36,920 --> 02:49:45,920
I mean, it's straight up walking into the cartoon, and if you are not playing Yu-Gi-Oh, you are in the mini production of a movie.

2367
02:49:45,920 --> 02:50:10,680
p0k3smot42o

2368
02:50:10,680 --> 02:50:15,560
right now. He didn't die or anything. He's just on a mission right now.

2369
02:50:15,560 --> 02:50:23,280
I don't have anything. I already talked about my toys.

2370
02:50:23,280 --> 02:50:27,800
We have another question for Ask Orange Lounge from Chance. And Chance is asking, when are

2371
02:50:27,800 --> 02:50:32,760
you going to update the chat server info on the website? Zing! I didn't know it was wrong.

2372
02:50:32,760 --> 02:50:36,300
I actually did not know it was wrong. I will look into that. Thank you for bringing that

2373
02:50:36,300 --> 02:50:41,240
to my attention. Yikes! I thought it worked just fine. I'm still the one using the Java

2374
02:50:41,240 --> 02:50:45,820
chat. Maybe you know what it is? I think it's because one of the other side IRC things went

2375
02:50:45,820 --> 02:50:57,820
down. I will look into that. My bad. And Jazz, okay, his second question to us is, why are

2376
02:50:57,820 --> 02:51:10,860
boobs? That's the question. Why are boobs spelled B-E-W-B-S. Boobs. B-E-U-B-S. B-E-U-B-S.

2377
02:51:10,860 --> 02:51:27,480
Why are boobs? Why not? Lovely. Cause if milk came out their ass that'd be weird. They're

2378
02:51:27,480 --> 02:51:30,860
make the world go round. I mean think about it, when you were a kid and you were crying,

2379
02:51:30,860 --> 02:51:35,260
what did mom do? She shoved one of them in your mouth. Women out there, just understand,

2380
02:51:35,260 --> 02:51:40,660
if you ever want to make us shove one in our mouth, man.

2381
02:51:40,660 --> 02:51:41,660
Wow, okay.

2382
02:51:41,660 --> 02:51:42,660
Women.

2383
02:51:42,660 --> 02:51:45,660
What, what, what Jamie?

2384
02:51:45,660 --> 02:51:46,660
Tasty.

2385
02:51:46,660 --> 02:51:55,260
I'm changing the subject.

2386
02:51:55,260 --> 02:51:56,260
This is the next...

2387
02:51:56,260 --> 02:51:57,260
No you.

2388
02:51:57,260 --> 02:52:00,020
I don't want to go with this question because I don't know if I want to bring up politics

2389
02:52:00,020 --> 02:52:01,020
on this program.

2390
02:52:01,020 --> 02:52:04,300
If you want to argue politics, go to random chat on DDRFreak.

2391
02:52:04,300 --> 02:52:07,300
There's tons of politics threads there.

2392
02:52:07,300 --> 02:52:09,380
Who did you vote for on election day?

2393
02:52:09,380 --> 02:52:10,380
Ask the question to Zaku.

2394
02:52:10,380 --> 02:52:11,380
I think the answer was a few weeks ago.

2395
02:52:11,380 --> 02:52:12,380
I know.

2396
02:52:12,380 --> 02:52:14,320
Honestly, if you listen to the show enough, you know.

2397
02:52:14,320 --> 02:52:16,240
You know that Jamie voted for Bill the Cat.

2398
02:52:16,240 --> 02:52:17,700
You know that I voted for Terry.

2399
02:52:17,700 --> 02:52:18,700
You know that...

2400
02:52:18,700 --> 02:52:22,140
All the candidates were pieces of flaming shit, so...

2401
02:52:22,140 --> 02:52:23,140
And not flaming in the goo-way.

2402
02:52:23,140 --> 02:52:26,620
I mean flaming as in, on fire so they're extra stinky.

2403
02:52:26,620 --> 02:52:30,900
So, you know, if I voted, it'd probably have been like I would have voted for Kerry, but

2404
02:52:30,900 --> 02:52:36,060
the election machine would have seen that I was actually intoxicated or out of my mind

2405
02:52:36,060 --> 02:52:38,100
it would have voted Bush for me, so.

2406
02:52:38,100 --> 02:52:40,620
Now, let me take a poll here.

2407
02:52:40,620 --> 02:52:42,340
Who did vote on election day?

2408
02:52:42,340 --> 02:52:43,700
No matter who you voted for, you did vote.

2409
02:52:43,700 --> 02:52:44,700
I didn't.

2410
02:52:44,700 --> 02:52:46,960
It looks like me and Triple Explicit did.

2411
02:52:46,960 --> 02:52:50,260
Everybody here but Loki went and voted on election day, so that's something.

2412
02:52:50,260 --> 02:52:54,780
I mean, usually on a typical election year, there wouldn't be this many people voting,

2413
02:52:54,780 --> 02:53:00,060
So I think that says enough right there, at least everybody voted, well, a lot more people

2414
02:53:00,060 --> 02:53:01,580
than usual voted, which is good.

2415
02:53:01,580 --> 02:53:06,500
My take on voting has always been, if you're gonna complain about stuff, at least be proactive

2416
02:53:06,500 --> 02:53:07,500
one way or another.

2417
02:53:07,500 --> 02:53:11,060
It doesn't matter how you vote, as long as you do it, hey, you have a say.

2418
02:53:11,060 --> 02:53:14,660
That's why sometimes people say, oh yeah man, I hate what's going on, all this kind of stuff,

2419
02:53:14,660 --> 02:53:15,660
but I'm not gonna vote.

2420
02:53:15,660 --> 02:53:18,780
But how the fuck are you gonna change things?

2421
02:53:18,780 --> 02:53:21,820
I don't care how you vote, not everyone's gonna see eye to eye.

2422
02:53:21,820 --> 02:53:25,800
If you think the government should always be one certain party or the other, you're

2423
02:53:25,800 --> 02:53:27,280
no different than Osama.

2424
02:53:27,280 --> 02:53:32,200
If you think the government should be run one way only, then that's not a cool thing.

2425
02:53:32,200 --> 02:53:36,680
I think you've got to mix it up once in a while, and that's why we have different parties.

2426
02:53:36,680 --> 02:53:39,560
I know Jamie goes off about there's more than two parties.

2427
02:53:39,560 --> 02:53:45,080
I think what people aren't getting is you can't make change from the top down.

2428
02:53:45,080 --> 02:53:47,120
You've got to start from the bottom up.

2429
02:53:47,120 --> 02:53:51,480
If an independent party can't win a senator job sometimes, how the hell is it going to

2430
02:53:51,480 --> 02:53:56,700
be president. You know, it's just, I don't say it can't happen or shouldn't happen, but

2431
02:53:56,700 --> 02:54:00,620
I think they've just got to aim a little smaller first before they, you know, go for the big

2432
02:54:00,620 --> 02:54:01,620
prize.

2433
02:54:01,620 --> 02:54:08,140
I still am for disabling the electoral college, and getting rid of the party system altogether.

2434
02:54:08,140 --> 02:54:13,140
I am all for, and you might hear me complain about this later, I am all for disabling electronic

2435
02:54:13,140 --> 02:54:20,420
voting. Paperless voting is very bad, I think, yes, I totally agree with that.

2436
02:54:20,420 --> 02:54:24,420
Wait, it's Ask Orange Lounge. We got on electronic voting.

2437
02:54:24,420 --> 02:54:30,420
Electronic voting offers more of a chance that the vote is either not going to be counted, altered.

2438
02:54:30,420 --> 02:54:36,420
It has a lot more inconsistency. That's why voting, I did a write-in absentee.

2439
02:54:36,420 --> 02:54:44,420
Even though at the polls they had the floating hanging chad problem this year, just like they did back last election.

2440
02:54:44,420 --> 02:54:44,920
Why?

2441
02:54:44,920 --> 02:54:49,420
Well I think the way they need to do it is, honestly I love the way they do it in Sacramento County.

2442
02:54:49,420 --> 02:54:53,420
You have a mix of electronic and paper. You fill in the bubble and then you scan it.

2443
02:54:53,420 --> 02:54:57,920
And that way you scan it and if there's a dispute with the way they're scanned you have a paper trail.

2444
02:54:57,920 --> 02:54:59,920
I think it's a perfect way to do it, personally.

2445
02:54:59,920 --> 02:55:02,920
Oh, okay. I thought you meant like... Okay, never mind.

2446
02:55:02,920 --> 02:55:03,920
Scantron!

2447
02:55:03,920 --> 02:55:07,920
Yeah, I'm totally fine with Scantron voting. I just do not like electronic voting with no paper trail.

2448
02:55:07,920 --> 02:55:12,920
And for all those kids out there, you know it's really fun to do a Scantron test.

2449
02:55:12,920 --> 02:55:18,520
there's this little bubble in the top of the test marquee. And if you scan that in, guess

2450
02:55:18,520 --> 02:55:26,520
what? You're the answers. It really fucks up all the tests. Anyway, off the politics

2451
02:55:26,520 --> 02:55:33,560
subject, but I want to wrap up the last few questions here so we can close this segment.

2452
02:55:33,560 --> 02:55:37,480
Dark Knight has a weird one here. This might be a sad question, but this is all I have.

2453
02:55:37,480 --> 02:55:42,740
which trading card game slash cartoon crossover is the worst

2454
02:55:42,740 --> 02:55:45,360
that if you've seen any of them if you don't answer don't

2455
02:55:45,360 --> 02:55:47,180
all of them

2456
02:55:47,180 --> 02:55:48,440
all of them

2457
02:55:48,440 --> 02:55:52,260
not all of all of them so slowly all of them

2458
02:55:52,260 --> 02:55:54,580
i don't know kind of hard to say i mean

2459
02:55:54,580 --> 02:55:56,060
everyone i mean

2460
02:55:56,060 --> 02:55:58,780
by person not even a big a fan of pokemon really but

2461
02:55:58,780 --> 02:56:02,020
i think it's funny because not me it's kind of cool but i mean if i had to pick

2462
02:56:02,020 --> 02:56:02,780
one but

2463
02:56:02,780 --> 02:56:06,220
funny thing cuz i think of my cartoons and crossovers into t c g's

2464
02:56:06,220 --> 02:56:11,380
I heard a rumor from, like, Upper Deck, who does, like, the Marvel vs. series, like, soon

2465
02:56:11,380 --> 02:56:15,060
they're supposed to be releasing one with, like, the Justice League, so you could have,

2466
02:56:15,060 --> 02:56:18,700
like, Superman, Batman, the Wonder Twins, and all that stuff, versus, like, Brainiac,

2467
02:56:18,700 --> 02:56:19,700
Mitzel Plink, and all that.

2468
02:56:19,700 --> 02:56:22,700
I mean, would that not be just the coolest idea ever?

2469
02:56:22,700 --> 02:56:24,580
That would be a cool video game.

2470
02:56:24,580 --> 02:56:25,580
Card game, no.

2471
02:56:25,580 --> 02:56:26,580
Eh.

2472
02:56:26,580 --> 02:56:27,580
Is Aquaman in there?

2473
02:56:27,580 --> 02:56:28,580
Of course, man.

2474
02:56:28,580 --> 02:56:31,100
An Aquaman ain't gonna drown in no tub.

2475
02:56:31,100 --> 02:56:35,740
Alright, alright, one more, Duel Masters is pretty ass.

2476
02:56:35,740 --> 02:56:42,220
more question here then we got to wrap it up last question from oh last

2477
02:56:42,220 --> 02:56:46,580
question from dark Tetsuya he sent me a song to put in cage match this week and

2478
02:56:46,580 --> 02:56:50,060
he says you didn't use my song did this because I put it in the wrong format no

2479
02:56:50,060 --> 02:56:52,980
it's just because I really want to put that other song you know your song is in

2480
02:56:52,980 --> 02:56:57,660
my queue it'll come up eventually don't worry so no worries if you have

2481
02:56:57,660 --> 02:57:00,700
suggestions you can always send us an email one of the hosts an email and we'll

2482
02:57:00,700 --> 02:57:04,060
get your song in cage match if we like it and I do like his pick so I'll get in

2483
02:57:04,060 --> 02:57:07,060
Nobody except Spammer sends me an email.

2484
02:57:34,060 --> 02:57:37,060
Roadwalk, your final thought. Thanks for being here again, by the way, bud.

2485
02:57:37,060 --> 02:57:45,060
Uh, not a problem. Um, I just want to say, go out there, support Ultramix, too, and, uh, support, uh, Orange Lounge,

2486
02:57:45,060 --> 02:57:51,060
support, uh, all of Bemani, because, hey, man, you guys are like a Wonderbra, you are the wind beneath our wings,

2487
02:57:51,060 --> 02:57:55,060
you are all that, and, uh, bucket of wings, and, et cetera, et cetera, and I shall cut myself off.

2488
02:57:55,060 --> 02:57:59,060
Coca-Cola, Wonderbra.

2489
02:57:59,060 --> 02:58:02,060
Uh, explicit, your final thought.

2490
02:58:02,060 --> 02:58:05,560
Not to purchase WWX, rumble roses. Heh heh.

2491
02:58:05,560 --> 02:58:06,560
Yeah, yeah!

2492
02:58:06,560 --> 02:58:10,200
Uh, Low G. Low G, your final thoughts?

2493
02:58:10,200 --> 02:58:14,620
My headache's gone, that makes me happy.

2494
02:58:14,620 --> 02:58:20,060
Uh, my final thought is, um...

2495
02:58:20,060 --> 02:58:21,960
Hi. That's it, I have nothing else to say.

2496
02:58:21,960 --> 02:58:24,100
Uh, Jamie, your final thoughts?

2497
02:58:24,100 --> 02:58:28,280
I have to drive home in a freakin' Benadryl coma.

2498
02:58:28,280 --> 02:58:29,840
Damn nation.

2499
02:58:29,840 --> 02:58:34,720
I have to drive through the boring part of Vadie to get home.

2500
02:58:34,720 --> 02:58:41,000
And Mel has love for DDR Freak, I hear ya Jess, don't worry, it wasn't intentional.

2501
02:58:41,000 --> 02:58:43,640
And I have to drive with a broken car.

2502
02:58:43,640 --> 02:58:48,440
Yeah, so we've given DDR Freak tons of plugs tonight, you know, well, of course, the whole indication thing helps, but...

2503
02:58:48,440 --> 02:58:50,640
Yeah, it's cool.

2504
02:58:50,640 --> 02:58:54,880
I mean, it's, you know, pretty dope. We're starting to come together as one big Bamani bunch.

2505
02:58:54,880 --> 02:58:57,520
It's fucking Katamari, that's what it is.

2506
02:58:57,520 --> 02:59:01,800
Yeah, you know what, this DDR thing is going to die soon anyway, so we better all be prepared

2507
02:59:01,800 --> 02:59:04,720
to be Katamari Damacy Radio and Katamari Damacy Freak and Katamari Spot.

2508
02:59:04,720 --> 02:59:07,120
No, we're all getting like Katamari together, man.

2509
02:59:07,120 --> 02:59:10,920
You see, we built it up big enough to take DDR Freak, which is like the biggest of all

2510
02:59:10,920 --> 02:59:11,920
of us.

2511
02:59:11,920 --> 02:59:14,960
See, you started with Orange Lounge, then you rolled up DDR, and now you're going to

2512
02:59:14,960 --> 02:59:15,960
roll them up.

2513
02:59:15,960 --> 02:59:16,960
Yeah, seriously, seriously.

2514
02:59:16,960 --> 02:59:22,360
Orange Lounge has to roll up like all the other little Bomani sites before it can really

2515
02:59:22,360 --> 02:59:23,840
take on Freak, okay?

2516
02:59:23,840 --> 02:59:24,840
No, I'm kidding.

2517
02:59:24,840 --> 02:59:33,840
To answer in the chat room, as I am feeling very, very ill right now, I may or may not be online when I get home, I'm probably going to go right to bed, but we'll see.

2518
02:59:33,840 --> 02:59:41,840
It's all about Orange Lounge Town, in the brand new, coming to the DS.

2519
02:59:41,840 --> 02:59:43,840
Home!

2520
02:59:43,840 --> 02:59:44,840
Animal Crossing.

2521
02:59:44,840 --> 02:59:45,840
Bingo!

2522
02:59:45,840 --> 02:59:49,840
That's right, our free DS is going to be at my house soon.

2523
02:59:49,840 --> 02:59:54,840
I want a free DS. What the hell? What is with you people and your hookups?

2524
02:59:54,840 --> 02:59:55,840
To manage a GameStop.

2525
02:59:55,840 --> 02:59:56,840
You're free DS.

2526
02:59:56,840 --> 02:59:57,840
That's okay.

2527
02:59:57,840 --> 02:59:58,840
You're free Konami.

2528
02:59:58,840 --> 03:00:04,840
I'll feel good to have known that I earned my DS out of two days of hard work.

2529
03:00:04,840 --> 03:00:07,840
Way to put down everybody on Lanky Style. All right.

2530
03:00:07,840 --> 03:00:11,840
I think Dan earned his by having managed a GameStop for us on the show.

2531
03:00:11,840 --> 03:00:17,840
All right. All right. Final word of the show. Lanky Style, I'm going to give you tonight's final word, Mr. Lanky Style.

2532
03:00:17,840 --> 03:00:24,580
Mr. Lanky's got one word to sum it all up, one word to sum it all up, M-G-S-3-B-A-C-H!

2533
03:00:24,580 --> 03:00:30,300
That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

2534
03:00:30,300 --> 03:00:34,220
Orange Lounge Radio Live is an Orange Lounge Radio production.

2535

2536
03:00:39,820 --> 03:00:46,820
And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.

2537
03:00:46,820 --> 03:00:53,260
Well, it's the holiday season and Santa is checking his list to see who is naughty or

2538
03:00:53,260 --> 03:00:58,820
nice and I'm kind of feeling guilty, so I wrote a song.

2539
03:00:58,820 --> 03:01:15,820
So many presents. So little time. Santa won't be coming by my house this year.

2540
03:01:15,820 --> 03:01:22,820
Of course I tried to drown my sister and I pierced my ear.

2541
03:01:22,820 --> 03:01:26,820
Oh, mama made it perfectly clear

2542
03:01:26,820 --> 03:01:32,820
Santa don't like bad boys

2543
03:01:32,820 --> 03:01:35,820
Especially Jewish ones

2544
03:01:35,820 --> 03:01:39,820
Genifconop and Lego blocks

2545
03:01:39,820 --> 03:01:41,820
Are what I desire

2546
03:01:41,820 --> 03:01:43,820
So why'd I have to set

2547
03:01:43,820 --> 03:01:47,820
The pizza guy's hair on fire?

2548
03:01:47,820 --> 03:01:49,820
I told him I was sorry

2549
03:01:49,820 --> 03:01:51,820
I'm a liar

2550
03:01:51,820 --> 03:01:56,820
So no toys for me.

2551
03:01:56,820 --> 03:01:58,820
I don't deserve them.

2552
03:01:58,820 --> 03:02:03,820
I couldn't wait for a big wheel as the holiday neared.

2553
03:02:03,820 --> 03:02:08,820
But then I told my grandma that she had a beard.

2554
03:02:08,820 --> 03:02:11,820
Dear Santa,

2555
03:02:11,820 --> 03:02:14,820
I know what my problem is.

2556
03:02:14,820 --> 03:02:16,820
Why it can't be good.

2557
03:02:16,820 --> 03:02:18,820
It's a fear of intimacy.

2558
03:02:18,820 --> 03:02:27,820
You see, my whole life, whenever I've met someone really great like you, and I keep feeling I'm getting too close to them, something inside me makes me want to screw it up.

2559
03:02:27,820 --> 03:02:33,820
So in a weird way, the reason I'm so bad is because I love you so much, Santa.

2560
03:02:34,820 --> 03:02:44,820
Rock and sock and robot is what I was hoping for, but then I made a death threat to Vice President Gore.

2561
03:02:44,820 --> 03:02:50,820
Oh, Santa won't be knockin' on my door, cause he's a big, fat whore.

2562
03:02:52,820 --> 03:02:58,820
What made me say that shoots and ladders would be so good indeed?

2563
03:02:59,820 --> 03:03:03,820
So why'd I have to sell that copper bag of weed?

2564
03:03:04,820 --> 03:03:08,820
So, Santa, please give me my easy plate oven.

2565
03:03:08,820 --> 03:03:28,020
Santa won't you accept my apologies Santa can't you see, I'm begging you please

2566
03:03:28,020 --> 03:03:31,860
Oh, Santa next year, I'll do you right.

2567
03:03:31,860 --> 03:03:37,860
Live from New York, it's Saturday night.

2568
03:03:37,860 --> 03:03:40,060
Yay!

2569
03:03:40,060 --> 03:03:42,180
Thank you very much for listening,

2570
03:03:42,180 --> 03:03:44,180
and we'll see you next week.
