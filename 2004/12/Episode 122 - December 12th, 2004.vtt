07:21.360 --> 07:22.360
Another minigame?

07:22.360 --> 07:23.360
Oh, the McDonald's minigames.

07:23.360 --> 07:25.520
Did we ever end up talking about that last week?

07:25.520 --> 07:26.520
Yeah, we did.

07:26.520 --> 07:27.520
A little bit?

07:27.520 --> 07:28.520
Yeah, we did.

07:28.520 --> 07:30.040
So you can see where my attention is when it comes to this show.

07:30.040 --> 07:31.040
I can't remember anything.

07:31.040 --> 07:32.040
I don't know why I got it.

07:32.040 --> 07:33.040
I was like, hey, they still have them.

08:31.360 --> 08:33.880
like it works for me

08:33.880 --> 08:38.040
we're gonna kick it off with a song that was in two different balmani games

08:38.040 --> 08:39.560

08:39.560 --> 08:43.620

we'll be right back after this

09:13.620 --> 09:18.620
And I wanna say hit me baby and tell me you are my love

09:24.620 --> 09:30.620
I love you like you are baby, now I give you my heart

09:30.620 --> 09:35.620

09:35.620 --> 09:39.620
I love you babe, call me your man, Juliet

09:39.620 --> 09:42.620
Gotta tell her that the truth's come true

09:42.620 --> 09:46.120

Nothing can change my world

09:54.620 --> 09:56.620
In your love

10:24.620 --> 10:53.620
You can see to my eye, what you're feeling inside, and it feels the same in my eyes.

10:53.620 --> 10:56.580
If you dance on your soul, then you try to relieve

10:56.580 --> 10:59.300
Never run till your heart's in motion

10:59.300 --> 11:01.420
Feel it, feel it, baby

11:01.420 --> 11:05.460
Feel the fire, it's burning deep inside me

11:05.460 --> 11:08.900
Listen, listen, honey, listen to

11:08.900 --> 11:10.900
Promise it to you

11:10.900 --> 11:14.180
Dance to the heartbeat, whoa

11:14.180 --> 11:17.060
You better take your turn, turn right now

11:17.060 --> 11:20.580
Dance to the heartbeat and let it go

11:20.580 --> 11:23.300
Keep the power down and you'll find it strong

11:23.300 --> 11:25.300
Listen to the heartbeat

11:25.300 --> 11:26.300
Whoa-oh-oh

11:26.300 --> 11:29.300
You better think this is the time now

11:29.300 --> 11:31.300
Listen to the heartbeat

11:31.300 --> 11:32.300
And let it go

11:32.300 --> 11:35.300
You can follow that and just let it go

13:05.300 --> 13:17.740
A

13:17.740 --> 13:44.300
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

13:44.300 --> 13:49.060
We are back here on Orange Lawns Radio, episode number 122. Thank you guys for tuning in tonight.

13:49.060 --> 13:53.740
We do appreciate your support, as always. Some Eurobeat music in that break, just for

13:53.740 --> 13:56.860
you guys. Because you guys seem to dig that during the pre-show. At least those of you

13:56.860 --> 14:03.100
guys that spoke up in our chat room, www.orangelawnsradio.com. And if you didn't like that, well, you need

14:03.100 --> 14:06.920
to go back into chat and let us know so that the rest of the chat room can yell at you

14:06.920 --> 14:11.820
appropriately. Because that's what they'll do. I'd like to be the first to say I didn't

14:11.820 --> 14:16.820
like that. If you thought that break was bad, wait till you see the next break. I already

14:16.820 --> 14:22.120
have the music queued up for the next break. Tonight, the goal is to drive you all crazy,

14:22.120 --> 14:25.560
because, you know, it is the holiday time, and this is the time of year when everybody

14:25.560 --> 14:30.460
goes, we'll be crazy. So, you know, just thought we'd get some appropriate music to match that,

14:30.460 --> 14:37.640
so we'll see. And at some point tonight, Silent Hill, I promise, because it is the season.

14:37.640 --> 14:40.760
We'll do, you know what we'll do? We'll do like a Silent Hill break. I'll play both remixes

14:40.760 --> 14:46.880
of Silent Hill and then, like, your reign. You need to play both versions of Silent Hill

14:46.880 --> 14:52.880
and then that one song by Roman Holly that was in Dancing Stage. Oh! That's a Christmas

14:52.880 --> 14:58.920
song, too. If I can find it. We need to hear You're Not Here. Can I put that song on repeat

14:58.920 --> 15:03.280
four times in my car on the way here? We'll definitely do You're Not Here a little later.

15:03.280 --> 15:08.120
Remember when Para Para, or Para Para, however you like to say it, Para Para Para? Para Para.

15:08.120 --> 15:13.720
and that used to be cool. It seems like the subject comes up at least once a month on

15:13.720 --> 15:18.640
this show. When Para Para was cool. Okay, wait a minute. I remember when we all met

15:18.640 --> 15:24.760
at MIGL when they first got it and I only knew how to do half of the Para Para. So I

15:24.760 --> 15:28.960
tried. I remember tutorial mode in Second Mix and I taught myself how to do it. And

15:28.960 --> 15:31.960
I tried to learn the Mickey Mouse March, which we heard in that break there. The Mickey Mouse

15:31.960 --> 15:37.200
March is freaking hard. Freaking hard! Oh my god. And the DeltaDance.com is hard. I

15:37.200 --> 15:38.500
I think I'm, no, I never learned that one.

15:38.500 --> 15:41.940
No, you were watching when I tried to learn that one in Stockton.

15:41.940 --> 15:46.980
I, now, Loki sits here and bashes on Para Para, but I remember when he used to break

15:46.980 --> 15:50.460
out his white boy freestyle to some Para Para songs.

15:50.460 --> 15:55.260
Yeah, that was back in the day when I was doing knee drops on DDR, I've come a long

15:55.260 --> 15:56.260
way since then.

15:56.260 --> 16:00.900
Dude, I remember how happy I was when I learned how to do deluxe.

16:00.900 --> 16:02.580
I get to go out there and shake my ass.

16:02.580 --> 16:04.060
I love doing deluxe, but I-

16:04.060 --> 16:06.660
No, you were funny doing Like A Virgin.

16:06.660 --> 16:13.660
Like A Virgin was like the second Para Para I ever learned. I remember living at the Bhumani Bhumani house.

16:13.660 --> 16:15.660
But did everyone learn Boom Boom Fire first?

16:15.660 --> 16:17.660
You remember the Bhumani house years ago, right?

16:17.660 --> 16:18.660
Yes.

16:18.660 --> 16:19.660
I should say Bhumani Drama house.

16:19.660 --> 16:22.660
Bhumani Drama house, to say the least.

16:22.660 --> 16:26.660
You know, different times, what can you say?

16:26.660 --> 16:33.660
But I remember when the house got Para Para, and that was like the first one I made myself sit down and learn.

16:33.660 --> 16:38.140
I'd already learned Boom Boom Fire, but I was like, it's got a Madonna connection.

16:38.140 --> 16:39.900
As a gay man, I have to learn this dance.

16:39.900 --> 16:42.180
And it wasn't really.

16:42.180 --> 16:43.700
It's actually kind of challenging.

16:43.700 --> 16:46.460
I still barely remember it to this day.

16:46.460 --> 16:54.660
Well, I know that my first one that I learned was actually Eurobeat, which was really easy.

16:54.660 --> 16:57.860
And then I learned, I tried to learn Speedway.

16:57.860 --> 17:01.380
But Boom Boom Fire was my third one.

17:01.380 --> 17:07.340
And then when we had the five-song chorus, I learned how to do... Night of Fire was

17:07.340 --> 17:08.340
my second one.

17:08.340 --> 17:09.340
That was it.

17:09.340 --> 17:10.340
Remember Sexy, Sexy, Sexy?

17:10.340 --> 17:11.340
I know.

17:11.340 --> 17:12.340
That was awesome.

17:12.340 --> 17:15.700
But I wanted to learn, when we were still playing, I wanted to learn O Sole Mio, and

17:15.700 --> 17:16.700
I never did.

17:16.700 --> 17:18.700
Just because the little walk where you'd fan your ass.

17:18.700 --> 17:21.220
You know what I'm talking about.

17:21.220 --> 17:22.220
You said-

17:22.220 --> 17:24.340
O Sole Mio, I just farted.

17:24.340 --> 17:29.140
Well, you do your hand to one side, and then you do your other hand back like the I'm the

17:29.140 --> 17:35.500
a little teacup dance except you're fanning your ass as you move forward. It's like, my

17:35.500 --> 17:41.660
ass is on fire! Put me out! Most people who play Para Para probably have

17:41.660 --> 17:48.420
an ass on fire. That was a good one. You're welcome, anytime. It's little observations

17:48.420 --> 17:52.580
like that that make this show worth it, you know. Yeah, you're so not PC. I remember that

17:52.580 --> 17:57.020
was really the first time we ever hung out, I think, that I met you was that whole trip.

17:57.020 --> 18:06.220
And then we went on to Ziggle, and Enrique was with us, and we both got our crappy freestyle

18:06.220 --> 18:13.820
on fourth mix, and somehow or another, we ended up doing a complete mirror of each other,

18:13.820 --> 18:17.260
and decided we were gonna be all rad and did knee drops on the last thing, but it was like

18:17.260 --> 18:18.260
the two knee one.

18:18.260 --> 18:19.260
It was to...

18:19.260 --> 18:23.780
Shoot, what was the song that everybody hated from third mix?

18:23.780 --> 18:25.500
Was that the guy that always did the Buell dance?

18:25.500 --> 18:26.500
Yeah.

18:26.500 --> 18:27.940
you're okay

18:27.940 --> 18:29.020
that uh...

18:29.020 --> 18:32.580
white and he had a song and i think the broadband sound dancing

18:32.580 --> 18:34.940
but we ended up i'd back-to-back

18:34.940 --> 18:36.460
at the same time it was people

18:36.460 --> 18:38.220
it was like oh my god

18:38.220 --> 18:41.300
whatever happened to that guy

18:41.300 --> 18:42.420
really

19:08.060 --> 19:09.820

20:39.360 --> 20:46.360
I get paid like Wednesday, so I have to wait until after payday to buy presents for people.

20:47.480 --> 20:50.760
I'm just a procrastinator. I'm not going to be buying any presents until Christmas Eve.

20:50.760 --> 20:55.280
My whole week was nothing but school and working my ass off at the gym. Oh, I love my dad so

20:55.280 --> 21:02.160
much. Wow, these are so cool. And they have apples with needles in them.

21:02.160 --> 21:08.280
The perfect Halloween treat. Oh my God, I love this outfit. I would wear

21:08.280 --> 21:09.280

21:54.540 --> 21:58.320
we're going to fix that the reign of princess peach terror

21:58.320 --> 22:00.620
com

22:00.620 --> 22:06.300
And you know what we got? Me and Tia won a game, you know, one of the mini-games, and we got Daisy Boo.

22:06.300 --> 22:10.780
Now, Princess Peach is still a playable character, right? Thank God, because

22:10.780 --> 22:13.700
I always play Princess Peach. I throw a fit if I can't be Peach.

22:13.700 --> 22:18.140
You want to be the pretty princess.

22:18.140 --> 22:20.500
Because I love when she does that,

22:20.500 --> 22:23.640
Peach is the winner! thing, and she flips her hair.

22:23.640 --> 22:27.100
We need to move the chatroom over the

22:27.100 --> 22:35.820
webcam again. But anyway, we were trying to decide what to eat, so we kept talking about

22:35.820 --> 22:45.220
fish tacos. And we couldn't get off of the subject about eating fish tacos.

22:45.220 --> 22:50.380
How exactly do a bunch of women in Islander hanging out together prepare fish tacos?

22:50.380 --> 22:59.340
we were just it just came up but a bunch of women hanging out preparing fish

22:59.340 --> 23:05.780
tacos anyway it made me think about that time we went to the elephant barn I

23:05.780 --> 23:09.660
ordered fish tacos and you laughed about it I did I giggled like a half hour

23:09.660 --> 23:13.220
straight I am so immature but you know what I know our listeners are mature

23:13.220 --> 23:17.500
tour because I'm looking at the chat room right now it's everybody is making

23:17.500 --> 23:24.500
I was referring to burning heat, but burning heat can also refer to ass-quirking.

23:47.500 --> 23:54.500
14 moons. If one doesn't bathe or something. Anyway. Flash in the ass. My week, my day.

23:55.100 --> 24:01.100
Hello. I have things to do. Sorry, I was just preoccupied. Drifting asses. Ass. Rob. What?

24:01.100 --> 24:08.100
Do you like the ass? Ass master. There's something in the air tonight. It's a little too much

24:10.100 --> 24:16.740
eggnog going around for everybody, I think. Dude, I had alcohol, even a little bit, even

24:16.740 --> 24:21.000
when you cook all the alcohol out I still react to it like giggly and it's

24:21.000 --> 24:30.160
gonna I cooked tonight too oh yeah back to last night um stop reading the chat

24:30.160 --> 24:34.280
room they're too immature tonight they don't deserve that all right well we

24:34.280 --> 24:38.560
could we just like could not decide on what to eat so finally Ross is all we're

24:38.560 --> 24:40.560
We're just going to do a hometown buffet.

24:40.560 --> 24:42.560
Ew!

24:42.560 --> 24:44.560
So we went to like the...

24:44.560 --> 24:49.560
I've been to a couple of different hometown buffets and they were all kind of okay, you know.

24:49.560 --> 24:52.560
We went to the one on the ass end of White Avenue.

24:52.560 --> 24:56.560
And I literally do mean the ass end. It's like up there by Walmart.

24:56.560 --> 25:00.560
Which to anybody who's not in this area has no idea what you're talking about.

25:00.560 --> 25:02.560
It's like the ghetto side of it.

25:02.560 --> 25:08.920
If anyone has ever been in Sacramento, if you're going up past where McClellan was,

25:08.920 --> 25:09.920
it's up in the ass.

25:09.920 --> 25:12.400
So basically you went to a hometown buffet in the ghetto.

25:12.400 --> 25:13.400
Yes.

25:13.400 --> 25:14.400
Okay.

25:14.400 --> 25:16.800
And there were people there saying, nah, after this we're gonna go get some entertainment

25:16.800 --> 25:17.800
over at Wal-Mart.

25:17.800 --> 25:18.800
Okay, whatever.

25:18.800 --> 25:26.000
So, uh, I ate a bunch of food, it was yummy, of the Temple of Butt.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
Oh no, I'm sorry.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
Stop reading chat!

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
Stop.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
I command you.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
Bite me?

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
Mmm, potato.

25:32.000 --> 25:36.000
Oh, that's what happens when you cook food, it gets hot.

25:36.000 --> 25:41.000
Oh, okay, I hate to acknowledge chat, but this one is really winner. Captain Jack Ass.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
Ha!

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
Get it?

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
Ha ha!

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
Sorry.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
I was the ass.

25:46.000 --> 25:50.040
Alright, I'm gonna start kicking people, making ass comments. We need to get the show back

25:50.040 --> 25:55.000
on track. We're not gonna just sit here and say ass for 3 hours straight tonight. What?

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
Get on ass, Loudstyle.

25:57.000 --> 26:00.000
Okay, week, week, day. Hometown buffet.

26:00.000 --> 26:08.000
Yeah, so we came back, watched Rejected, and Hedvig, and I am a banana.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
What?

26:12.000 --> 26:18.000
My Rejected DVD was part of the settlement in my last relationship.

26:19.000 --> 26:26.000
I made out with a third style, fourth style, and a DDR pad, and he made out with the Rejected DVD, so it was a fair trade.

26:26.000 --> 26:33.000
We watched Rejected, and then we watched Hedwig and the Angry Inch, and I love that movie.

26:33.000 --> 26:38.000
And then I went home. And then today, I sat on my ass and did nothing.

26:38.000 --> 26:41.000
Well, okay, I went to the grocery store to buy cream, and Dan's like,

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
Burn me some ice cream!

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
Okay...

26:45.000 --> 26:48.000
So he sat around watching Return of the King, which I don't want to watch,

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
because I think Gollum is, like, retarded and...

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
There is something weird about that guy.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
Who's creepy?

26:53.000 --> 26:57.520
Well, of course, he's meant to be creepy, but he's, like, actually turned to my stomach.

26:57.520 --> 27:01.600
Although, I did manage to peek down for some of the Legolas scenes, so that was cool.

27:01.600 --> 27:03.600
I was like, ooh, Elfman.

27:03.600 --> 27:09.480
And, uh, so I came up here early before the show, about the time pre-show started, and

27:09.480 --> 27:10.480
I cooked.

27:10.480 --> 27:12.280
Yes, you did.

27:12.280 --> 27:19.920
I made these kebabs with, uh, shrimp and scallops topped with lobster tail.

27:19.920 --> 27:29.720
And I made green beans, cooked in butter and herbs, with cream sauce to coat.

27:29.720 --> 27:32.360
And I'm actually putting the recipe for the cream sauce in my live journal.

27:32.360 --> 27:36.760
For anyone who goes to the live journal, only my friends can see it, so you're the lucky

27:36.760 --> 27:37.760
few.

27:37.760 --> 27:39.280
Well, you could always put it in the Orange Lounge community, because the Orange Lounge

27:39.280 --> 27:40.280
community needs something.

27:40.280 --> 27:41.280
I don't like them.

27:41.280 --> 27:42.280
Why?

27:42.280 --> 27:43.280
Are you kidding?

27:43.280 --> 27:44.280
Rare.

27:44.280 --> 27:46.640
I'll let someone else repost it for me.

27:46.640 --> 27:52.640
basically I made this amaretto cream sauce to go over it cuz you know

27:52.640 --> 27:58.460
normally when I make green beans... wait, wait, wait, amaretto... okay sorry had to have a moment

27:58.460 --> 28:02.620
normally when I make green beans I go for like the Italian style spicy or I'll

28:02.620 --> 28:07.720
do a Cajun style I went for sweet cream this time and I had garlic in it

28:07.720 --> 28:13.680
Jamie let her let me eat her sweet cream and it was good but I had garlic in it

28:13.680 --> 28:20.280
and some pepper and amaretto and butter and cream and there's a lot of

28:20.280 --> 28:26.400
ingredients in Jamie's sweet cream okay whatever um but I am like this I like

28:26.400 --> 28:29.680
just pulled this recipe right out of my ass and it tended to be really good I

28:29.680 --> 28:34.320
keep saying what is with the ass fixation with you people tonight everybody

28:34.320 --> 28:38.180
gay this is my normal phrasing okay and the

28:38.180 --> 28:42.480
The chat room is imitating me. Pay me some rent, bitches.

28:42.480 --> 28:47.480
I love you guys. A little.

28:47.480 --> 28:48.480
I'm done.

28:48.480 --> 28:49.480
Oh, you're done?

28:49.480 --> 28:50.480
Yeah, I'm done.

28:50.480 --> 28:53.240
Wait, but whatever happened? There were no fun stories about Hometown Buffet? You kind

28:53.240 --> 28:54.240
of glossed right over there?

28:54.240 --> 28:58.320
No, the people scared me there. They're like the guy in painter overalls with the beer

28:58.320 --> 28:59.320
belly.

28:59.320 --> 29:00.320
You know, I heard that there were-

29:00.320 --> 29:01.320
He was pregnant.

29:01.320 --> 29:04.360
I heard that there were, there are people out there that will go to Hometown Buffet

29:04.360 --> 29:07.040
in the morning and then stay there all day long.

29:07.040 --> 29:10.360
I think they have a policy where they kick them out because they have to change

29:10.360 --> 29:14.200
the dinners and everything in between. Well, that's the smart thing to do.

29:14.200 --> 29:19.160
Can you imagine that? One of these nights where we have to go to the buffet over at

29:19.160 --> 29:21.160
Thunder Valley.

29:21.160 --> 29:22.480
That is a good buffet.

29:22.480 --> 29:27.080
You know what? It's a little slice of Vegas right here in our backyard. We need to do that like right before,

29:27.080 --> 29:28.920
we need to do that on

29:28.920 --> 29:31.840
the night before New Years Eve.

29:31.840 --> 29:34.360
Do like the Orange Lounge, bring the tape recorder.

29:34.360 --> 29:35.480
We could do something like that.

29:35.480 --> 29:39.280
We should do that. It's like pre-New Year's Eve, eat a whole bunch of sugar

29:39.280 --> 29:44.400
a thon. Alright, sounds good. Alright, I'm done. Alright, uh, Loki!

29:44.400 --> 29:48.140
Okay, Loki's eating, so we're gonna go to Angel. Angel, how was your week, how was your day?

29:48.140 --> 29:52.020
I played a little bit of Imani this week, uh, 7th style,

29:52.020 --> 29:54.400
just cause I haven't bought 8th style yet.

29:54.400 --> 29:57.320
But, uh, I kinda gave up after, like, a couple songs, cause

29:57.320 --> 30:01.660
my controller's being a bit of a pain in the butt.

30:01.660 --> 30:03.320
Honestly, like, it's just

30:03.320 --> 30:10.320
the king

30:10.400 --> 30:14.520
and uh... also i found a new korean game addiction

30:14.520 --> 30:16.700
probably talk about later because

30:16.700 --> 30:21.840
i don't know if you guys in the state

30:21.840 --> 30:27.080

30:27.080 --> 30:29.880
that it's a mix between like

30:29.880 --> 30:31.160

31:31.660 --> 31:35.660
This is my really starchy, really full of sodium meal.

31:36.660 --> 31:38.660
That's really good for me, I'm sure.

31:39.660 --> 31:42.660
Anyways, how'd this week go? Oh yeah.

31:43.660 --> 31:45.660
First window to a funeral. That was fun.

31:46.660 --> 31:48.660
Got to see lots of family, but there was ham, so that was good.

31:48.660 --> 31:57.380
And then, you talking about ham makes me think of this thing that was in the Christmas present

31:57.380 --> 32:03.500
that you got me. Did I tell you about this? I'll talk about it later. After the kids go

32:03.500 --> 32:13.300
to bed later in the show. God. Anyways, so then after that, let's see, Wednesday I didn't

32:13.300 --> 32:19.940
do anything. Thursday I took the day off to take my car down to get the brakes fixed.

32:19.940 --> 32:28.060
That was wonderful because it's done now. Play lots of Final Fantasy. It's going to

32:28.060 --> 32:34.420
work on the cabinet. I actually did work on the cabinet and my DDR pads create too much

32:34.420 --> 32:41.460
SAC electricity and it ends up trying or temporarily shorting out the IPAC every time I use them

32:42.540 --> 32:44.540
So I got to modify them again

32:45.260 --> 32:48.420
Slightly hopefully and hopefully that'll fix it

32:48.940 --> 32:50.780
if not

32:50.780 --> 32:52.940
Gotta Chuck them that makes me sad

32:53.660 --> 32:55.340
but um

32:55.340 --> 33:01.620
yeah, so I worked on that and lots of Final Fantasy and I had to make cookies for

33:01.620 --> 33:08.100
tomorrow at work because our boss volunteered us you had to make cookies

33:08.100 --> 33:12.700
or your mom had to make cookies I had to make cookies

33:12.700 --> 33:20.580
it's just cookies it's not like you toss them no I did not toss the cookies no so

33:20.580 --> 33:25.100
yeah he volunteered us to do this thing and none of us wanted to do it and then

33:25.100 --> 33:31.580
he's like yeah we'll do it as a team but I'm not gonna do it so you know what

33:31.580 --> 33:36.860
I ended up having to make cookies, and they looked like nipples.

33:36.860 --> 33:38.820
And, um,

33:38.820 --> 33:41.660
I also sold some other cookies for my mom's house.

33:41.660 --> 33:45.300
And, uh, there's some that look like croissants that are pretty good.

33:45.300 --> 33:46.940
And, um,

33:46.940 --> 33:53.940
I ate all the butter cookies that she had. She gave me. So, oh, so good.

33:54.160 --> 33:58.980
Oh, and I saw Blade Trinity yesterday, and that was good.

33:58.980 --> 34:02.980
I just didn't really care anymore, but Ryan Reynolds made it funny.

34:02.980 --> 34:05.760
Because Wesley Snipes, just, eh.

34:05.760 --> 34:12.260
But Ryan Reynolds being a jackass, that's good.

34:12.260 --> 34:15.660
Ryan Reynolds, this is Alanis Morissette's fiancé.

34:15.660 --> 34:20.400
I did, how sad is that? Alright, anyway. You're the resident Alanis, man. I totally am.

34:20.400 --> 34:25.520
That was the music I was listening to before, but money. And still, really. I mean, I can't listen to DDR music 24-7.

34:25.520 --> 34:28.300
I don't know how some people out there do that. And I know it's ironic, considering

34:28.300 --> 34:32.500
the radio station that we do, but even in the radio station we do, I think we have enough

34:32.500 --> 34:37.000
diversions away from the normal playlist where even if you listen to our station 24-7, you

34:37.000 --> 34:41.740
wouldn't be hearing Bomani 24-7. I like listening to other music once in a while. We can hear

34:41.740 --> 34:45.620
a lot of that randomness on Jamie's show. If you ever wondered, why does Jamie's show

34:45.620 --> 34:50.500
exist on a video gaming network when she plays complete random stuff, that's why. Because

34:50.500 --> 34:54.700
you can't listen to gaming music 24-7, I'm sorry. You gotta appreciate the other music

34:54.700 --> 34:58.200
it's out there once in a while so Jamie is your music appreciation here I'm

34:58.200 --> 35:01.600
gonna murder everybody with a whole bunch of your beat just like with all

35:01.600 --> 35:07.000
the gamers once in a while you need to go outside anyway my week of idea was

35:07.000 --> 35:12.080
pretty good I just played a lot of Final Fantasy myself I I went out last night I

35:12.080 --> 35:15.640
went out to the bar which is good it was the first time that my buddy since you've

35:15.640 --> 35:19.480
been out of the hospital got to go we had a good time I drank a little bit and

35:19.480 --> 35:23.320
met some people I like it when strangers randomly come up and talk to me and

35:23.320 --> 35:27.000
There was this girl there who was just like Karen from Will and Grace and that made me

35:27.000 --> 35:29.200
love her because, you know, I love Karen on that show.

35:29.200 --> 35:31.680
If you guys watch Will and Grace, you know it's all about Karen on that show.

35:31.680 --> 35:33.160
I don't even know if I know who you're talking about.

35:33.160 --> 35:35.040
See, he knows what I'm talking about.

35:35.040 --> 35:37.680
And then, you know, I've been doing a lot of stuff at work.

35:37.680 --> 35:41.000
I've been busy, busy at work and it's kind of funny you talk about your boss making you

35:41.000 --> 35:44.560
all do this, you know, cooking thing because we're doing something similar in my work right

35:44.560 --> 35:48.960
now where, you know, we're doing all these winter events and you have to be politically

35:48.960 --> 35:49.960
correct.

35:49.960 --> 35:51.640
You can't say Christmas stuff.

35:51.640 --> 35:55.880
holiday stuff you know so we had a holiday ornament decoration contest that

35:55.880 --> 35:59.680
everybody had to participate well you didn't have to but you know everybody

35:59.680 --> 36:04.280
was supposed to participate in and I was so busy teaching because that's why I do

36:04.280 --> 36:08.520
it my job I teach I was so busy that I did not have a chance to decorate my

36:08.520 --> 36:12.240
ornament until about two minutes before so what I did is I printed out a picture

36:12.240 --> 36:15.720
of SpongeBob SquarePants face from the internet and then I pasted it on the

36:15.720 --> 36:18.960
ornament and colored it in yellow highlighter and it looked pretty it was

36:18.960 --> 36:23.860
a spongebob ornament. It was awesome. And people liked it though. So, you know, I get

36:23.860 --> 36:29.100
points for that. And tomorrow I have to decorate my cube, so. What can I say? What is this

36:29.100 --> 36:34.100
you're showing in LiveJournal right now? Kitty. It's a puppy! Oh, it's a puppy? It looks like

36:34.100 --> 36:39.260
a kitty from back here. It's a shellty. Oh, okay. Thank you for totally derailing this

36:39.260 --> 36:44.860
segment. Oh, it's so cute! Uh, also earlier this week I picked up Final Fantasy Dawn of

36:44.860 --> 36:48.780
Souls, which is Final Fantasy I and II on the Game Boy Advance, and I can't stop playing

36:48.780 --> 36:51.960
it. I haven't even touched Final Fantasy II yet. I've just been playing Final Fantasy

36:51.960 --> 36:57.540
I because they totally redid it. They made the battle system more like IV and just everything

36:57.540 --> 37:01.780
is more like Final Fantasy IV but, you know, with Final Fantasy I's story and it's awesome.

37:01.780 --> 37:05.680
I highly recommend it if you're a Final Fantasy fan. And the great part is, I will sit there

37:05.680 --> 37:11.580
and while I wait for a party in Final Fantasy XI, I'll play Final Fantasy I on my DS. So,

37:11.580 --> 37:17.740
I'm just a total Final Fantasy whore lately. But that's okay. I'm allowed. Alright. So

37:17.740 --> 37:23.100
that's pretty much my week of my day so we're gonna move right along here you

37:23.100 --> 37:26.620
know what's going on tonight right now actually right now and I hate talking

37:26.620 --> 37:30.740
about reasons for you to leave orange lounge radio because you should be

37:30.740 --> 37:35.660
listening to our show you know all the time however this is as good of excuse

37:35.660 --> 37:38.900
as any I figure if you've got to go I mean this is this would be something I

37:38.900 --> 37:42.140
would want to listen to do mini head you know we had him on the show a couple

37:42.140 --> 37:46.100
weeks ago he's doing a live spinning thing right now where he's debuting some

37:46.100 --> 37:50.480
new material and stuff, it's actually going on right now over on www.midihead.com. I'm

37:50.480 --> 37:54.500
trying to work out something where maybe we can play it later, so I'm hoping I can hear

37:54.500 --> 37:59.140
it a little later, but, you know, if you're a fan of Midihead and he's a great guy, I

37:59.140 --> 38:03.220
know there's a lot of fans out there, you probably would want to check that out at some

38:03.220 --> 38:08.620
point, but, you know, I'll be sad if you leave. But no, you gotta support all internet radio,

38:08.620 --> 38:09.620
so, you know.

38:09.620 --> 38:10.620
Probably.

38:10.620 --> 38:13.700
Do what you gotta do. No, you're not leaving, Loki. You're stuck. You're under contract.

38:13.700 --> 38:14.700
Contract?

38:14.700 --> 38:26.140
alright yeah it's it's a contract sealed with blood you get paid in meat all

38:26.140 --> 38:31.220
right um we're gonna go to a break when we come back from the break we'll talk

38:31.220 --> 38:34.660
about some more stuff going on the Bahmani scene I want to take a call over

38:34.660 --> 38:37.820
sky is actually a couple calls I want to do over Skype tonight but I've got one I

38:37.820 --> 38:41.940
want to do right when we come back somebody said something very interesting

38:41.940 --> 38:48.340
in our chat room. And it has to do with remixes. And it has to do with you, Loki. I'm going

38:48.340 --> 38:51.860
to have him call in and talk about that when we come back from this break. In this break,

38:51.860 --> 38:56.060
I promised a fun theme. We're going to do happy music. And this is a lot of happy music

38:56.060 --> 39:01.660
that was suggested to us by folks in the chat room. No happy music. Yes, happy music. We'll

39:01.660 --> 39:08.660
We'll be back.

40:31.660 --> 40:33.660
Oh

41:01.660 --> 41:23.660
I put a little bit of you today Look how I set it up myself for you

41:23.660 --> 41:29.660
Look a little bit at me today You know you gotta try a little bit

41:29.660 --> 41:33.160
Say, you know you gotta try a little harder

41:33.160 --> 41:36.660
So you can be my, my, my, my darlin'

41:36.660 --> 41:39.660
Slide a little slide, let's enjoy the moment now

41:39.660 --> 41:42.160
And just have a good time

41:42.160 --> 41:43.160
A good time

41:43.160 --> 41:44.660
Try it baby, good

41:44.660 --> 41:49.160
A little bit of love and gonna feel so fine

41:49.160 --> 41:51.660
Is it really true to feel the same way too?

41:51.660 --> 41:56.660
And hope we'll be together now

41:56.660 --> 42:04.660
You know that I love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you

42:04.660 --> 42:07.660
When I'm feeling sinking up

42:07.660 --> 42:10.660
A funny word we call love

42:10.660 --> 42:13.660
Still don't think of you as it burns

42:13.660 --> 42:16.660
Most time a lizard comes above

42:16.660 --> 42:19.660
If you wanna capture me

42:19.660 --> 42:22.660
It's as simple as can be

42:22.660 --> 42:32.660
Michelin has said it, all you need is

42:32.660 --> 42:38.660
Love, my love, my love, my love, my love

42:38.660 --> 42:40.660
Oh

44:38.660 --> 45:00.060
Which I?

45:00.060 --> 45:05.060
No, no, nobody does, no, nobody does, can't save me

45:06.060 --> 45:07.060
Bye baby balloon

45:11.060 --> 45:13.060
Bye, bye baby balloon

45:15.060 --> 45:17.060
Bitch, get a new song

45:18.060 --> 45:20.060
An open letter from Orange Lounge Radio

45:21.060 --> 45:22.060
We are back here on Orange Lou-

45:22.060 --> 45:23.060
Whoops, no we're not, there we are

45:25.060 --> 45:26.060
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio

45:26.060 --> 45:28.060
Yeah, that was the very first promo

45:28.060 --> 45:34.700
a promo, I think. Me and the ex actually did that one. That was, you can hear the ex singing

45:34.700 --> 45:41.620
in that one. I refused to participate in that one. No sing-along for Jimmy. I did do the

45:41.620 --> 45:49.620
solitary voice. I remember we came up with that one in your car. Yep, I remember that

45:49.620 --> 45:53.820
one in the, I'll play the other one later. There was another one we came up with too.

45:53.820 --> 45:56.940
it was really all you. Actually it was Dan, really.

45:56.940 --> 46:05.860
Yeah, the take on me one. Yeah, we'll get that in a little later.

46:05.860 --> 46:10.660
Alright, during the break there, Loki was booting up Stepmania because he wanted to

46:10.660 --> 46:14.660
show me some dancing characters in Stepmania. I guess there's some new characters that hit

46:14.660 --> 46:19.140
the internet this week. What's going on with Stepmania's dancing characters? I didn't think

46:19.140 --> 46:21.620
there was a scene for character creation, but apparently there is.

46:21.620 --> 46:35.620
Well, there's some funny ones. Vivi from Final Fantasy IX was in there as one of the dancing characters, and a really crappy done Maria from, was it Silent Hill 3, is it? It doesn't look like Maria, but whatever.

46:35.620 --> 46:45.620
Anyway, so those are available. I can't remember where they are, though, because the link was on DDArmaniaX, but that site's been down for a few days now.

46:45.620 --> 46:55.620
But they're out there. God, I can't remember... I don't know. It's a site that has a bunch of stuff on there. They did a bunch of...

46:55.620 --> 47:06.620
Oh, crap, I can't remember. It's the same site that hosts all the official ones. They have one that the guy has been ripping them from 5th Mix and 3rd Mix now. It's that site that hosts those, that's where you can find those two.

47:06.620 --> 47:12.620
But, um, yeah, I was also showing Rob, uh, there's an older one I got a while back, uh, Master Chief from Halo.

47:12.620 --> 47:15.620
That one was rad. That one was cool.

47:15.620 --> 47:19.420
makes the Master Chief look so fruity because he's like swinging his arms around going,

47:19.420 --> 47:25.140
woo, I'm dancing. And the song that Loki was playing was some sim file for I'm Your Bogeyman

47:25.140 --> 47:29.340
by Xtreme. And like he just picks up the Master Chief going, woo, I'm your boogeyman, I'm

47:29.340 --> 47:34.980
your boogeyman. This is a really amazing image. But the VV one was really good. That was pretty,

47:34.980 --> 47:39.920
I mean, it's not perfect, but it's hilarious. Like it gets the job done. It's fun to watch.

47:39.920 --> 47:44.300
So definitely check that out. If anybody in our chat room happens to know where those

47:44.300 --> 47:48.900
those characters are hosted. Feel free to post it in chat. Again, it was on DDR Maniacs,

47:48.900 --> 47:57.980
but, but, um, they're down there. We had a little, uh, glitch there on Live 365. Comcast

47:57.980 --> 48:01.740
Party. What we're gonna do, I don't know if it was Comcast. No, I don't think it was that.

48:01.740 --> 48:06.340
I just think it was a station part. We're gonna go to a quick break, just to make sure

48:06.340 --> 48:09.500
folks have a chance to reconnect. I hate it when that stuff happens. We'll be right back

48:09.500 --> 48:16.500
back after this guys.

48:39.500 --> 48:59.500
Are you ready to dance to the night that you did it to my heart it was right there

48:59.500 --> 49:04.500
Sure you need your magic, under the moonlight

49:04.500 --> 49:08.500
Bounds of lights, of bloody people

49:08.500 --> 49:11.500
Love what's me, I don't know why

49:11.500 --> 49:14.500
Do the next and this move to the felt

49:14.500 --> 49:17.500
And what is what you need?

49:17.500 --> 49:20.500
Monkey dance, monkey dance

49:20.500 --> 49:23.500
Make a star, shake it, pull it down

49:23.500 --> 49:26.500
Step on the monkey dance, blast it together

49:26.500 --> 49:29.500
Hold the fire, baby

49:29.500 --> 49:32.500
Monkey dance, monkey dance

49:32.500 --> 49:35.500
Like we shall move your body down

49:35.500 --> 49:37.500
Step on the monkey dance

49:37.500 --> 49:38.500
Look at that tail

49:38.500 --> 50:04.500
We are back here on Orange Launch Radio, sorry about that, we had some kind of station hiccup,

50:04.500 --> 50:05.500
something happened.

50:05.500 --> 50:10.260
It happens once in a while, Live 365 or something, there was a faulty connection between our

50:10.260 --> 50:15.340
house and Live 365, either a hiccup on our end or a hiccup on their end.

50:15.340 --> 50:20.260
I know Live 365 was doing a bunch of maintenance yesterday, so all the Live 365 stations were

50:20.260 --> 50:21.260
down.

50:21.260 --> 50:25.700
We were down, DDR Free Radio, On Your Station Live, all the Live 365 stations were down

50:25.700 --> 50:26.700
yesterday.

50:26.700 --> 50:32.700
So maybe something's going on with that, I don't know, but we do appear that we are back.

50:32.700 --> 50:37.940
Remember, if you ever miss any or all of a show, any part, all, whatever, you can hear

50:37.940 --> 50:43.900
the show in its entirety on DDR Freak Radio, Friday nights, 6 o'clock, Pacific Standard

50:43.900 --> 50:47.340
Time is when that airs, but it's gonna be interesting though, I have no idea how that

50:47.340 --> 50:51.940
hiccup is gonna translate into the archive. I think it just keeps right on going, so you'll

50:51.940 --> 50:59.980
hear us going, crap, station down! All hands on deck! Weird, so I don't know what's going

50:59.980 --> 51:08.980
Anyway, before we got dropped there, we were talking about new dancing characters in StepMania, and it looks like Loki found the site where he can actually get those dancing characters from, right?

51:08.980 --> 51:15.980
Well, it's not this site. I thought it was the same site, but it doesn't look like it is. It was PlazmaDance.com was where some of them were.

51:15.980 --> 51:25.980
Okay, so some of them are on there, PlazmaDance.com, so you can check that out if you are curious about it. Does it have the Master Chief? Because that's the one people really have to get.

51:25.980 --> 51:26.980
No.

51:26.980 --> 51:27.980
Oh, it doesn't?

51:27.980 --> 51:29.980
Well, forget it then.

51:29.980 --> 51:30.980
Don't waste your time.

51:30.980 --> 51:31.980
I'm just kidding.

51:31.980 --> 51:33.980
There's a lot of good ones on there though.

51:33.980 --> 51:34.980
Alright.

51:34.980 --> 51:35.980
Um.

51:35.980 --> 51:36.980
Wow.

51:36.980 --> 51:38.980
Trying to get back on track here.

51:38.980 --> 51:39.980
Um.

51:39.980 --> 51:40.980
Let's see.

51:40.980 --> 51:45.060
What I wanted to do now is I wanted to actually go to the phones on the Skype line and if

51:45.060 --> 51:51.100
you want to participate in the Skype line, just go to our website, www.orangelauntrader.com

51:51.100 --> 51:56.460
and click on interact with us and it's got all the details on how you can actually interact

51:56.460 --> 52:01.940
with the program and actually there's a specific person I'm looking to hear from that I'm hoping

52:01.940 --> 52:07.580
will be calling us in a minute here because he was talking about something in chat earlier

52:07.580 --> 52:11.680
so we're going to open up the Skype line so he can get through. So I'm specifically looking

52:11.680 --> 52:15.740
for the person I have a prearranged phone interview with so if you're somebody else

52:15.740 --> 52:19.700
don't worry you'll have an opportunity to call on the show later. Hi you're on Orange

52:19.700 --> 52:23.180
Hey, is my mic on?

52:23.180 --> 52:27.860
Uh, you're, you're, you're fading out there a little bit. Make sure all your other transfers

52:27.860 --> 52:32.780
and your bandwidth is open there. Can you hear us?

52:32.780 --> 52:33.780
Hello.

52:33.780 --> 52:34.780
Hello.

52:34.780 --> 52:36.780
Hi.

52:36.780 --> 52:37.780
Am I okay?

52:37.780 --> 52:41.180
I think so. We'll just keep going with this. Who is this?

52:41.180 --> 52:42.580
This is John Fields.

52:42.580 --> 52:44.700
Hi, John Fields. How are you?

52:44.700 --> 52:45.760
I'm doing fine.

52:45.760 --> 52:49.580
All right. What did you call in to talk to us about tonight? By OC Remix. Uh, you know

52:49.580 --> 52:56.580
you know what? right now

54:19.580 --> 54:25.080
Yeah, that song's kinda fitting right now, a little gentle stress being caused by faulty internet connections.

54:25.080 --> 54:27.080
We're gonna keep going with this as best we can, guys.

54:27.080 --> 54:29.580
Uh, I don't know what to tell you, though, about that.

54:29.580 --> 54:32.080
Um, I don't know if it's on our end.

54:32.080 --> 54:35.580
I don't think it's on our end, because we haven't been having any internet problems for a long time now.

54:35.580 --> 54:43.080
I know we used to have a lot of problems with internet here, but ever since the really cool tech guy came out, we haven't really been having problems, have we, Logie?

54:43.080 --> 54:44.640
Now it's

54:44.640 --> 54:49.680
Yeah, the real cool tech. I came out and just use pliers something I could have done in like three seconds

54:49.680 --> 54:52.240
You know what the he thought of it and you didn't that's the point

54:52.920 --> 54:56.200
Well, I can't help it if he's more experienced with their faulty equipment. Um,

54:57.240 --> 55:01.940
So yeah. Anyway, again if you missed all our part you can always tune in to

55:03.400 --> 55:07.480
And now we're having sound issues my god if enough stuff wouldn't break around here

55:07.480 --> 55:14.480
Again, you can always tune into DDR Free Radio to hear the archive in full, along with other

55:14.480 --> 55:17.800
live programming that goes on throughout the week here on Orange Launch Radio, which usually

55:17.800 --> 55:19.580
doesn't get affected by this kind of stuff.

55:19.580 --> 55:24.160
You can tune in to Pump Up The Volume on Tuesday nights, hosted by the lovely Dark Sacra.

55:24.160 --> 55:30.560
Monday nights, Diversion, Orange Launch Radio, Bimani remixes, and Thursday nights, Outside

55:30.560 --> 55:35.680
The Box, which will be in reruns this week, actually, because I'm going to be out this

55:35.680 --> 55:36.680
week.

55:36.680 --> 55:40.200
and about in LA. I'm actually going to LA this week. I was kind of hoping that I'd get

55:40.200 --> 55:45.000
to go to Arcade Infinity while I was down in LA, but it doesn't look like that's going

55:45.000 --> 55:50.280
to happen because me and four co-workers actually have to share a car. Doesn't that suck?

55:50.280 --> 55:56.240
A tremendous amount of ass. However, there's a good noodle place over there by AI. You

55:56.240 --> 56:02.240
should just go in there for dinner. Maybe, I don't know. It's really a good place.

56:02.240 --> 56:10.580
I'll have to see. All right, more to do. And we're still getting sound issues. This is

56:10.580 --> 56:17.460
bad. I'm sorry, guys. Everything's breaking. We keep going down. We're going to call it

56:17.460 --> 56:23.060
a show. I'm getting pretty pissy here. We'll see. We'll keep going best we can, though.

56:23.060 --> 56:28.500
Let's go get sushi. Seriously? I'm like, food. All right, let's go to another break and just

56:28.500 --> 56:32.320
Just kind of hope things are good when we come back and we'll try calling John again

56:32.320 --> 56:35.620
and get out some more Bamani news and just, you know, keep doing what we do here.

56:35.620 --> 56:38.320
So we'll be back after this little break here.

56:38.320 --> 56:42.580
I think we'll do that Silent Hill break I was talking about earlier.

56:42.580 --> 56:43.900
So we'll be back.

56:43.900 --> 56:45.900
Happy Holidays to everybody out there.

57:13.900 --> 57:22.900
Tonight is the night for our love yous

57:22.900 --> 57:29.900
Wish we could have this evening

57:29.900 --> 57:34.900
The year that Christmas is here

57:34.900 --> 57:36.900
Christmas is here

57:47.900 --> 57:52.900
Night falls on you

57:53.900 --> 57:58.900
And if you want me near you

57:58.900 --> 58:03.900
Oh, my Lord, see what you make

58:03.900 --> 58:08.900
The night falls on you

58:08.900 --> 58:11.900
Oh, my Lord, know my soul

58:11.900 --> 58:13.900
The thoughts you fear

58:13.900 --> 58:15.900
Your heart is strong

58:15.900 --> 58:20.900
Christmas is here

58:45.900 --> 58:52.900
It would be a much better fight, with you, with me

58:52.900 --> 58:59.900
If you hadn't let me, I'd be fine on my own, baby

58:59.900 --> 59:06.900
Never felt so lonely, never felt so alone

59:06.900 --> 59:12.900
If you hadn't left me, I'd be fine on my own, baby

59:12.900 --> 59:18.900
Never felt so lonely then you came along

59:18.900 --> 59:21.900
So now what should I do?

59:21.900 --> 59:24.900
I'm strung out, addicted to you

59:24.900 --> 59:28.900
My body aches, now that you're gone

59:28.900 --> 59:33.900
My supply fell through

59:33.900 --> 59:38.400
Glad they gave me everything you had and more

59:38.400 --> 59:40.900
You craved my happiness

59:40.900 --> 59:43.400
When you made me feel joy in me

59:43.400 --> 59:45.400
Just smile for now

59:45.400 --> 59:47.400
I feel your stress

59:47.400 --> 59:49.400
Love was never meant to be

59:49.400 --> 59:52.400
Such a crazy affair, no

59:52.400 --> 59:54.400
And who has time but you?

59:54.400 --> 59:56.400
Never thought I'd sit around

59:56.400 --> 01:00:00.400
And unravel your love

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:39.400
I love you drinking and toasting at such a special day

01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:45.400
Tonight, nightfall, I love you

01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:51.400
Wish we could have this evening

01:00:51.400 --> 01:01:00.400
Do you remember you? Christmas is here. Christmas is here.

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:16.400
Tonight, nightfall, I love you

01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:25.400
And if you wouldn't need it, you would be my heart baby

01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:33.400
But tonight's the night before I love you

01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:37.400
No, I can't stop the fear

01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:43.400
Are you calling Christmas is here?

01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:51.400
We often wonder how some of those Bomani songs are chosen.

01:01:57.400 --> 01:02:01.400
One hit wonder, one hit wonder, one hit wonder, one hit wonder

01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:04.400
One hit wonder, one hit wonder, one hit wonder

01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:09.400
One hit wonder, one hit wonder, one hit wonder, one hit wonder, one hit wonder

01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:14.400
We think we figured it out. Orange Lounge Radio.

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:17.400
Hi, we're back. And hopefully things are stable.

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:21.400
I think the internet is just completely fucked tonight, basically, is what it boils down to.

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:24.400
Because I notice people keep dropping from our chat room, left and right,

01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:28.400
and the Skype chat a little bit earlier was really kind of freaky.

01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:32.400
So we're under attack! The internet is screwed!

01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:34.400
I don't know what's going on.

01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:36.400
The internet's on vacation.

01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:38.400
I cannot find anything on this damn game.

01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:43.400
Of course, people in the chat room right now are bitching because we played Silent Hill twice in that break.

01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:47.400
But, you know, it's Christmas. It's mandatory that we have to do that.

01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:51.400
Just think, you'll go the whole rest of the year and you won't have to hear it again. Except for next week.

01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:53.400
Alright, let's try this again. We're going to give Jon a call back.

01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:57.400
Kind of start from the top, before people got booted before.

01:02:57.400 --> 01:03:08.520
Hello? Hi, John, you there? Yep. Good, you sound a lot better this time. Okay, I think

01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:15.120
the internet might be fixed. Okay. We'll see. Anyway, from the top. So, you're in the Overclocked

01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:22.160
Remix channel this week. Yep. And you're asking about fusion mixes. Right, I was wondering

01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:27.400
after all what came out today which was i believe another

01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:29.920
before you remix or something like that

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:31.060
uh...

01:03:31.060 --> 01:03:34.400
i was wondering if maybe we could try getting out low keys are remixed in

01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:37.880
there just for fun well first you've got to talk you've got to talk low key into

01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:41.880
it because he's pretty protective over his material there

01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:46.040
well i've spoken for the higher up today and uh...

01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:49.840
hit the higher up is there no c hierarchy or something

01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:54.120
The Trump of OC? Okay, no, I'm kidding.

01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:56.140
Basically, what it is, is it's like

01:03:56.140 --> 01:03:59.940
most of the chat channel users are unvoiced

01:03:59.940 --> 01:04:02.960
and the higher-ups are voiced.

01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:04.120
And then there's

01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:09.360
pretty much DJ Pretzel and then a couple of bots, I think, up at the top.

01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:11.360
Okay, gotcha.

01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:15.840
And I was on the voice today and

01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:19.080
Aurora is the name.

01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:25.160
I think she said that she would like us to try getting it in there.

01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:28.700
Well, now how many DDR remixes are on OC Remix?

01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:29.820
Not a lot, right?

01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:33.600
Yeah, it's like three or four right now, I think.

01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:37.700
What'd he say, Loki? Oh, he's looking at the site right now.

01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:40.780
He sizes it up.

01:04:40.780 --> 01:04:45.580
There's a request for more Bimani, actually. There's a request for more Bimani.

01:04:45.580 --> 01:04:49.420
I'm moving the mic over to you. What do you think of this?

01:04:49.420 --> 01:04:52.140
I don't know.

01:04:52.140 --> 01:04:55.800
Now see, I like OC Remix. It's a good site. There's a lot of really good remixes on

01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:58.260
there. I think it would be pretty exciting if you got it on there.

01:04:58.260 --> 01:05:00.220
And you know what? Yet again,

01:05:00.220 --> 01:05:02.100
you could just continue to kick

01:05:02.100 --> 01:05:05.780
those people who say that Fusion remixes are not real remixes.

01:05:05.780 --> 01:05:09.500
I mean, not only did you get Midihead, who actually has a song in DDR on here a couple

01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:10.620
weeks ago, saying

01:05:10.620 --> 01:05:13.620
he uses his ass in his mixes, but

01:05:13.620 --> 01:05:18.220
then you could get one of these mixes on oc remix and you would just

01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:21.420
you would have the hugest internet penis i mean seriously

01:05:21.420 --> 01:05:23.020
almost as big as jason's

01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:24.340
i don't think it would

01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:26.120
fall i think under the fact

01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:29.060
if i remember correctly i don't think it would be allowed

01:05:29.060 --> 01:05:36.060
actually

01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:38.300
no i don't think

01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:40.140
i don't think it would work

01:05:40.140 --> 01:05:43.700
you don't feel work because the fact that you mix that your songs with other

01:05:43.700 --> 01:05:46.900
songs that are already out this year kind of using too much commercial music

01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:49.600
is that what you think the problem is

01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:52.980
yet copyright music

01:05:52.980 --> 01:05:54.420
i have no permission from

01:05:54.420 --> 01:05:56.500
original artist

01:05:56.500 --> 01:05:59.680
yeah but i mean

01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:03.700
there are songs on there that have remixed our life and thought i think uh...

01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:07.040
i think there's like a jingle bells on their mixed with uh... super mario world

01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:09.160
i think

01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:12.440
ever jingle bells is uh... public domain

01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:14.160
i think so

01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:15.360
that maybe

01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:18.340
even the happy birthday song is not public domain if you believe that you

01:06:18.340 --> 01:06:20.620
know every time you think the happy birthday song is supposed to give some

01:06:20.620 --> 01:06:22.160
guy a quarter basically

01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:25.480
well not really but you know happy birthdays a copyrighted song

01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:27.160
look he's going to look into a john

01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:28.860
that's mostly do for you

01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:32.560
okay i'm i'm hoping i'm hoping he'll do it i think it would be good

01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:36.240
all right i'm all for pouring out the show everywhere possible

01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:38.260
you know thanks for looking out for so

01:06:38.260 --> 01:06:44.740
keep us posted okay all right later bye bye our chat room is being a bunch of

01:06:44.740 --> 01:06:56.100
babies again they're complaining because the webcam isn't showing anything I'm

01:06:56.100 --> 01:07:00.900
forcing angel to go sit on the couch so you have someone to look at that was my

01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:07.540
impression of the chair so I guess you could I could submit it because it

01:07:07.540 --> 01:07:11.540
It doesn't say that you can't. It's not in there, like, submission guideline things here.

01:07:11.540 --> 01:07:16.540
All it says is that, you know, you have to be the original artist of, you know, whatever it is.

01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:18.540
But it doesn't say it can't.

01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:20.540
Um, well...

01:07:21.540 --> 01:07:23.540
Okay. I don't know.

01:07:24.540 --> 01:07:28.540
The worst that could happen is they call you a lamer. Honestly.

01:07:28.540 --> 01:07:31.540
What's the worst that could happen if you submitted a song?

01:07:32.540 --> 01:07:34.540
I don't know. I don't really know.

01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:38.540
I'm trying to talk him into doing it, but he's being a pussy.

01:07:38.540 --> 01:07:42.540
Alright, anyway, moving right along.

01:07:42.540 --> 01:07:45.540
What's this stuff, you were talking during the break there, you were reading some various

01:07:45.540 --> 01:07:48.540
Bamani sites, finding out something going on with Papa Music?

01:07:48.540 --> 01:07:52.540
Papa Music Iroha, which I don't know crap about because I wasn't keeping up with Papa

01:07:52.540 --> 01:07:56.540
Music, but apparently Papa Music Iroha was out last week, so.

01:07:56.540 --> 01:08:00.540
And is that just Papa Music 12?

01:08:00.540 --> 01:08:03.540
I don't, yeah, I think so.

01:08:03.540 --> 01:08:07.540
Hooray! Another pop of music! Just what we need right now, you know?

01:08:07.540 --> 01:08:11.540
No, actually, I like pop of music. Uh, good time, but...

01:08:11.540 --> 01:08:19.540
I would pull up the title on my laptop, but I still need to install the Japanese language patch, so...

01:08:19.540 --> 01:08:23.540
Alright. What do you say we get into a cage match for tonight?

01:08:23.540 --> 01:08:24.540
Sure!

01:08:24.540 --> 01:08:30.540
Alright, let's, uh, queue up the music, then.

01:08:30.540 --> 01:08:35.540
Who's gonna go first in tonight's cage match? You know, we had to retire somebody last week, so now we get to go in whatever order we want.

01:08:35.540 --> 01:08:36.540
Why don't you start, Rob?

01:08:36.540 --> 01:08:38.540
I get to start? Oh goodie.

01:08:39.540 --> 01:08:40.540
Hold on.

01:08:41.540 --> 01:08:42.540
Alright.

01:08:42.540 --> 01:08:44.540
The way the cage match works, boys and girls,

01:08:45.540 --> 01:08:56.540
each host brings to the table one song and you guys will vote on your favorite song, which will go into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio,

01:08:56.540 --> 01:09:01.540
The Monty Music and More program which plays 24 hours a day, 7 days a week on this station

01:09:01.540 --> 01:09:03.540
when there's no live program.

01:09:03.540 --> 01:09:07.540
So last week in the Orange Mountains Radio Cage match we retired a song.

01:09:07.540 --> 01:09:11.540
It has won for a month straight, meaning it's gone.

01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:16.540
Here it is, a final send off for Gwen Stefani, What You Waitin' For.

01:09:16.540 --> 01:09:20.540
Your life is short, you're capable

01:09:25.540 --> 01:09:28.540
So look at your watch now

01:09:28.540 --> 01:09:31.540
You're still a super hot female

01:09:31.540 --> 01:09:35.540
You've got your million dollar contract

01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:38.540
And they're all waiting for your heart track

01:09:38.540 --> 01:09:45.540
What you waiting, what you waiting, what you waiting, what you waiting, what you waiting for?

01:09:45.540 --> 01:09:51.540
Won't you wait it, won't you wait it, won't you wait it, won't you wait it, what you waiting for?

01:09:51.540 --> 01:09:55.540
I can't believe it, oh

01:09:55.540 --> 01:10:02.540
Alright, everybody say goodbye to Gwen Stefani, she is being retired.

01:10:02.540 --> 01:10:03.540
Poot!

01:10:03.540 --> 01:10:10.540
Alright, so we're going to go ahead and say goodbye to Gwen Stefani.

01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:15.180
all right she is retired from the orange on straight okay too much all right that

01:10:15.180 --> 01:10:18.900
means you guys get three brand new songs tonight Jamie has decided that I'm gonna

01:10:18.900 --> 01:10:24.340
go first I declare this as official woman of orange on radio okay fair enough

01:10:24.340 --> 01:10:30.740
I have the chair fair enough all right my song and how appropriate what my song

01:10:30.740 --> 01:10:36.700
is tonight I'm gonna have to dedicate this one to Jamie for that comment

01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:47.660
My song is a song called Bitch and it's by a group called J-Punch and it's from

01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:52.260
this trans anthems compilation I found and I liked it. So here it is song number

01:10:52.260 --> 01:10:59.260
number one in tonight's cage match that you can vote for, Bitch, the open air remix. Enjoy.

01:11:22.260 --> 01:11:27.260
You are a bitch

01:11:27.260 --> 01:11:31.260
And I hate myself

01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:36.260
And I try

01:11:36.260 --> 01:11:42.260
You are a bitch

01:11:42.260 --> 01:11:49.260
And I can't get free

01:11:49.260 --> 01:11:56.260
Do you wanna be king?

01:11:56.860 --> 01:12:00.360
And I hate myself

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:05.260
And I try

01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:11.240
Do you wanna be king?

01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:16.240
Did you wanna be king?

01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:34.240
And I've been waiting for something, and I've tried

01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:40.240
You do the war a bit, but you do the work a bit, but you do the work a bit

01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:57.240
You live your life with me in the snow

01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:01.240
And I try

01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:08.240
You're a bad dude

01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:16.240
You're a bad dude

01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:18.240
In the world of revenge

01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:20.240
You're a bitch

01:13:48.240 --> 01:14:09.320
Song number one in tonight's cage match, Bitch, the open air remix by J. Punch.

01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:10.320
Jamie!

01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:14.040
It was pretty good, I have to say.

01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:17.480
It's a lot more energetic than most trance that you play.

01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:19.480
I think it's the eight.

01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:21.480
And you are a bitch.

01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:23.480
I'm being serious.

01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:25.480
I'm just kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:26.480
I'm a cindered.

01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:28.480
No, I love you, treat me.

01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:30.480
I cooked for you.

01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:31.480
I know.

01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:32.480
Bitch.

01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:36.480
But you gotta remember the rest of the lyrics, and I hate myself for it, so.

01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:37.480
Alright.

01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:38.480
Angel.

01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:42.480
Um, I'll give it an eight and a half.

01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:43.480
That's pretty cool.

01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:44.480
You're gonna be okay?

01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:45.480
Alright.

01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:46.480
Uh.

01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:51.480
p0k3smot42o I give it an 8

01:14:51.480 --> 01:15:06.480
p0k3smot42o I mean honestly I didn't think you guys would like that one at all and it looks like our chat room doesn't so it probably doesn't have much of a chance but even though it's a little repetitive I like songs that say bitch what can I say so it gets 8 points for that

01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:11.480
p0k3smot42o Alright let's move on to Jamie's pick, Jamie what did you pick tonight

01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:16.760
shows a song that I'm sure everyone's probably heard, but it just really suited my mood for

01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:26.760
the past week or so. It's Delirium with Sarah McLachlan's Silence, and it's very, very somber.

01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:33.280
Alright, so a mood fitting one, alright. Yeah, and really I just put it in because I've been

01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:40.680
listening to it just off and on all week, so. Alright, let's hear it. Delirium with

01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:47.680
in silence. Enjoy.

01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:12.680
I know

01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:17.680
If we

01:16:18.680 --> 01:16:22.680
really

01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:30.680
finish me

01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:37.680
I am

01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:52.680
And I can't breathe, please

01:16:52.680 --> 01:17:04.680
Heaven longs to stand up on earth And the warning to believe it

01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:16.680
I get caught up when the raging river slides In this morning I am sleeping

01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:21.680
In this silence

01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:24.680
In this moment

01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:34.680
In this silence I believe

01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:58.680
I can't help this longing, comfort me

01:17:58.680 --> 01:18:19.680
I can't hold it only if you won't let me

01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:35.000
Heaven holds a sense of wonder And I'm wanting to believe that I'll get

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:40.000
When the raging leaves the fire

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:45.000
In this fire I am singing

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:50.000
In this silence

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:53.000
In this silence

01:18:53.000 --> 01:19:00.000
In this silence I believe

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:05.000
I have seen in this quiet way

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:10.000
You are silent

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
You are free

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:15.000
In this quiet way

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:22.000
We are free

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:55.360
All right, that was song number two in tonight's cage match, courtesy of Dark Sakura Delirium,

01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:58.960
with Sarah McLachlan. Silence. Jamie, what'd you think?

01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:02.360
I love that song. Like I said, I've been listening to it a whole bunch, so it gets an automatic

01:20:02.360 --> 01:20:09.040
ten for me, just from having been completely fitting my mood all week. It's been a de-stressing

01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:12.040
song. Okay, fair enough. Loki.

01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:24.040
God, this sounds like a sex scene, that's all it sounds like. I've heard this song so many times. It's good. I'm gonna give it an 8.

01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:26.040
Angel.

01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:30.040
It's Delirium, so I would probably give it a 9.

01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:35.400
me personally about two years ago I would have given that song a 10 but I've

01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:39.360
played the fuck out of it since then so I would give it an 8 but then I

01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:42.920
remembered that delirium is kind of popular again in the Bahmani sing

01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:46.680
because of after all being in ultra mix 2 so that's a good chance for those that

01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:50.040
haven't heard that song before to kind of hear a little bit else delirium so I

01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:56.480
give it a 9 overall all right let's see song number three tonight comes to you

01:20:56.480 --> 01:21:01.120
courtesy of Loki. Remember, if you don't agree with our votes, which apparently in the chat

01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:04.080
room a lot of you guys disagree with the way we talk about song number one and you can

01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:09.600
blow me. But remember, it does come down to your vote in the chat room. So we'll be voting

01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:15.260
as soon as this song's done that comes to you via Loki. And what song are we gonna hear?

01:21:15.260 --> 01:21:19.120
Well, if you grew up in the 80s, then you already know what this song is. And if you've

01:21:19.120 --> 01:21:23.920
watched, you know, the Breakfast Club, then you already know what this song is. This is

01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:31.920
This is the Simple Minds with Don't You Forget About Me, and it's not sung horribly, like myself, or the singer in Carry Over Your Revolution.

01:21:32.920 --> 01:21:34.920
What's up with you guys and old school songs tonight?

01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:41.480
All right fair enough anything's game here in the orange launch cage match, and this is it simple minds. Don't you forget about me enjoy?

01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:33.040
Won't you come see about me, I'll be alone Dancin' you know it, baby, I'll be the one

01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:38.540
You know it baby, tell me your troubles and doubts

01:22:38.540 --> 01:22:43.040
Given everything inside and out and

01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:47.040
Love's strange, the real and the dark

01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:52.040
Think of the tender things that we were working on

01:22:52.040 --> 01:22:56.040
Slow change may pull us apart

01:22:56.040 --> 01:23:00.540
When our lives get in your heart baby

01:23:00.540 --> 01:23:05.540
Don't you forget about me

01:23:06.540 --> 01:23:09.540
Don't, don't, don't, don't

01:23:09.540 --> 01:23:14.540
Don't you forget about me

01:23:17.540 --> 01:23:21.540
Will you stand above me

01:23:21.540 --> 01:23:25.540
Look my way, will you ever love me

01:23:25.540 --> 01:23:34.540
Rain keeps falling, rain keeps falling down, down, down

01:23:34.540 --> 01:23:42.540
Will you recognize me? Call my name or walk on by

01:23:42.540 --> 01:23:53.540
Rain keeps falling, rain keeps falling down, down, down, down

01:23:53.540 --> 01:23:56.540
Hey, hey, hey, hey

01:24:09.540 --> 01:24:13.540
Don't you try and pretend

01:24:13.540 --> 01:24:16.540
It's my view you will win

01:24:16.540 --> 01:24:19.540
And I won't harm you

01:24:19.540 --> 01:24:22.540
Or touch your defensive vanity

01:24:22.540 --> 01:24:37.540
Don't you forget about me, I'll be alone Dance when you know it baby, I'm going to

01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:43.540
take you apart I'll put it back together, baby

01:24:43.540 --> 01:24:48.540
Don't you forget about me

01:24:49.540 --> 01:24:52.540
Don't, don't, don't, don't

01:24:52.540 --> 01:24:57.540
Don't you forget about me

01:25:00.540 --> 01:25:04.540
Will you stand above me

01:25:04.540 --> 01:25:06.540
Look my way

01:25:06.540 --> 01:25:09.540
Do you ever love me

01:25:09.540 --> 01:25:11.540
Rain keeps falling

01:25:11.540 --> 01:25:17.540
Rain keeps falling down

01:25:17.540 --> 01:25:22.540
Will you recognize me?

01:25:22.540 --> 01:25:26.540
Call my name or walk on by

01:25:26.540 --> 01:25:36.540
Rain keeps falling, rain keeps falling down

01:25:36.540 --> 01:25:41.540
Hey, hey, hey, hey hey

01:25:41.540 --> 01:25:46.540
Ooh, ooh

01:25:50.540 --> 01:25:55.540
Hey, hey, hey, hey

01:25:55.540 --> 01:26:01.540
Ooh, ooh

01:26:01.540 --> 01:26:15.540
Don't you forget about me

01:26:15.540 --> 01:26:19.540
Don't, don't, don't, don't

01:26:19.540 --> 01:26:25.540
Don't you forget about me

01:26:25.540 --> 01:26:34.040
As you walk on by, will you call my name?

01:26:34.040 --> 01:26:42.540
As you walk on by, will you call my name?

01:26:42.540 --> 01:26:45.540
When you walk away

01:26:45.540 --> 01:27:14.540
Oh will you walk away, will you walk on by I won't call my name, will you call my name

01:28:14.540 --> 01:28:19.540
Alright, song number three in tonight's cage match, Simple Minds, Don't You Forget About Me.

01:28:19.540 --> 01:28:20.540
Jamie?

01:28:20.540 --> 01:28:23.540
I love this song to bits.

01:28:23.540 --> 01:28:26.540
So much, and I'm so glad it's not a crappy remix.

01:28:26.540 --> 01:28:33.540
So, uh, there are 80 songs that I like better, but I really like that one a whole lot, so it gets a 9.

01:28:33.540 --> 01:28:36.540
Alright, Loki.

01:28:36.540 --> 01:28:39.540
I like that song, so it gets a 10.

01:28:39.540 --> 01:28:43.540
Because? I don't know.

01:28:43.540 --> 01:28:50.540
kostjamrh I just remembered, I was going to do a Duran Duran song tonight and I totally forgot. Alright, anyway. Angel.

01:29:13.540 --> 01:29:20.580
me personally I love that song a lot I just would have loved it at DDR length a

01:29:20.580 --> 01:29:24.840
lot more that song went on forever so I give it a six for the number of minutes

01:29:24.840 --> 01:29:33.460
it was all right let's review the songs you can vote for tonight starting off

01:29:33.460 --> 01:29:49.460
Starting off with song number one, which is a song called Bitch by J-Punch.

01:29:49.460 --> 01:29:53.480
And song number two that you can vote for tonight is Delirium featuring Sarah McLachlan

01:29:53.480 --> 01:30:15.760
with Silence, and song number three you can vote for tonight, Simple Minds, Don't You

01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:32.540
forget about me place vote now send a private message to sky in the chat room

01:30:32.540 --> 01:30:38.300
with your vote and we'll tally them up and see who the winner is all right

01:30:38.300 --> 01:30:44.140
meanwhile some stuff's going on here locally in town we just we found out

01:30:44.140 --> 01:30:47.220
something going on in one of our local arcades we've talked about a little bit

01:30:47.220 --> 01:30:54.620
on this show our vehicle RV GL and this new rumor has come up although you can't

01:30:54.620 --> 01:30:57.700
really call it a rumor I would say it's in that stage where it hasn't happened

01:30:57.700 --> 01:31:03.540
yet but it's a lot more solid than a rumor so it's kind of a it's a congealed

01:31:03.540 --> 01:31:06.600
mass yeah basically I don't know what you would call it when it's not really a

01:31:06.600 --> 01:31:10.420
rumor because there's lots of facts backing it up but there it's not hasn't

01:31:10.420 --> 01:31:13.820
happened yet either so it's that almost stage but that is is that Roseville

01:31:13.820 --> 01:31:18.220
Golf Land is going to get a 2DX machine, basically.

01:31:18.220 --> 01:31:23.220
What I think is most exciting about this is the fact that I think this is going to bring

01:31:23.220 --> 01:31:27.280
people back to RVGL, because let's face it, it's winter time now, so there's not as many

01:31:27.280 --> 01:31:33.740
stupid theme park kids hanging around there, and honestly, we've been kind of missing something

01:31:33.740 --> 01:31:36.180
like this for a while. You know what I mean? Remember when we used to have those Wednesday

01:31:36.180 --> 01:31:41.760
nights over at Golf Land, and we'd all go, and man, what was new in those days? That

01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:57.560
I remember that, because everybody was trying to unlock stuff in Max 2, and I kept trying

01:31:57.560 --> 01:32:02.840
to get AAA's on songs. I would just play sets of basic songs to try and get AAA's, because

01:32:02.840 --> 01:32:06.480
that was 10 points off if you could get a AAA. Remember that? That was fun. And then

01:32:06.480 --> 01:32:10.120
we'd all go to Brick Fields afterwards. I'm sure somewhere in your town, and I know we're

01:32:10.120 --> 01:32:13.360
national in some cases international broadcast I know maybe in your neck of

01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:16.480
the woods you guys do something similar but we haven't been doing this for about

01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:20.760
a year and a half when I don't know what happened like suddenly Scandia got the

01:32:20.760 --> 01:32:24.280
2DX machine a competing arcade in town and then everybody went there and then

01:32:24.280 --> 01:32:27.480
kind of everything kind of fell apart basically is what happened in the end so

01:32:27.480 --> 01:32:31.240
it's kind of exciting that Roseville Golf Line is gonna get 2DX machine 2DX it

01:32:31.240 --> 01:32:38.020
brings people together and how long do we freaking tell them seriously I give

01:32:38.020 --> 01:32:42.020
One week, and it's in operable.

01:32:42.020 --> 01:32:43.020
Sorry, broken?

01:32:43.020 --> 01:32:44.020
One week and it's broken.

01:32:44.020 --> 01:32:48.020
I will take a step further and say that the DVD drive goes out.

01:32:48.020 --> 01:32:55.020
One week and it's broken. They're buying a new monitor for it because I guess the monitor that was on it was fucked.

01:32:55.020 --> 01:32:58.020
Well, it's probably the old Shiggle monitor, huh?

01:32:58.020 --> 01:33:00.020
Usually, yes.

01:33:00.020 --> 01:33:05.020
So, um, I give it a week before the little kids fuck it up.

01:33:05.020 --> 01:33:09.020
I still think it's going to be the DVD drive that goes out or someone's going to spill something on the panel.

01:33:09.020 --> 01:33:16.020
It's going to be shit. And I'm afraid, you know, it's going to make people even more pissed off because it's just another game that they're not going to fix up.

01:33:16.020 --> 01:33:21.020
But, hey, whatever. Whatever makes you happy, I guess, you know.

01:33:21.020 --> 01:33:24.020
Whatever sinks your battleship.

01:33:27.020 --> 01:33:34.020
I totally agree with the fact that some little kid is probably going to spill something on it. I just hope they put the machine in a place where somebody can watch it.

01:33:34.020 --> 01:33:40.500
it? I don't know. What can they do to help 2DX not die? What do you guys think they could

01:33:40.500 --> 01:33:41.500
do?

01:33:41.500 --> 01:33:49.100
Uh, have a guard posted there 24-7, and have a height bar for you to be able to go up to

01:33:49.100 --> 01:33:50.100
the machine.

01:33:50.100 --> 01:33:51.580
That guard will be you, Jamie.

01:33:51.580 --> 01:33:53.700
They'll pay me, okay.

01:33:53.700 --> 01:34:02.940
Alright. I'm tallying up the votes for the cage match right now. What else do you think

01:34:02.940 --> 01:34:06.380
would be something fun that we could do to kind of get the crowds going to Golf Land

01:34:06.380 --> 01:34:07.380
again.

01:34:07.380 --> 01:34:13.220
I know. How about they fix my fucking machine that I built them? They spent all my hard

01:34:13.220 --> 01:34:20.760
time on and then went to shit really quick. How about that? That might be nice. Seriously,

01:34:20.760 --> 01:34:26.620
I don't know why I even try anymore. You know, why do I try? Because it just goes to shit.

01:34:26.620 --> 01:34:31.280
Fuck them. That's what I say. Fuck them. You know, I'm going to make my own machine. I'll

01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:50.280
I'm just tired of it. Tired of spending my time there trying to fix shit. Tired of people asking me to fix shit. I don't work there. I don't want to fix it. Hell, I didn't get paid for the last parts that I donated to fix it. So you know what? Fuck it. I don't care.

01:34:50.280 --> 01:34:57.280
So, yeah. What could they do to bring people back?

01:34:57.280 --> 01:35:06.280
Pay them. Strippers on bars. This would be RVGL, water slides, and strippers.

01:35:06.280 --> 01:35:11.280
Hey, they have dock. And derby on their floor.

01:35:11.280 --> 01:35:15.280
I need to go raise Ganguro again. Part of me kinda wants to go to RVGL tomorrow

01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:19.280
to see if they got the machine up and running. I just, another fact that makes me very happy

01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:23.500
that our Vigle is getting 2DX is that I really don't like going to Spigle to play, and I

01:35:23.500 --> 01:35:27.460
apologize if you're a Spigle regular, but there's a lot of you guys that hang out there

01:35:27.460 --> 01:35:34.000
that are kind of dicks, and I'm sorry, but like, I just feel this very thick, uh, you

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:35.000
know what I mean?

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:36.000
Thickiness.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:37.000
Thick thickness.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:43.920
When I walk into Spigle, it's like, if you can't pass eight stars, then you suck, and

01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:48.080
you shouldn't even deserve to play here, and they don't tell people when they get new machines

01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:51.880
and stuff because they don't want scary newbies around and stuff, and I just don't like that

01:35:51.880 --> 01:35:55.000
attitude, you know what I mean? And I'm sorry, because I have friends that play Swiggle,

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:59.000
you know, I'm not saying this is a, every single person is like this, but I just feel

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:04.620
this aura of shittiness when I walk in there, and I'm sorry. So that makes me very happy

01:36:04.620 --> 01:36:08.020
that our wiggle is going to be getting a machine, because I think a lot of people, even though

01:36:08.020 --> 01:36:17.480
our wiggle is kind of a, I don't, how do you put it? It's a dump in pretty rapping, basically.

01:36:17.480 --> 01:36:22.120
the people there really are pretty good. And I sense a lot of friendly people and, you

01:36:22.120 --> 01:36:26.000
know, I think more of a, you know, just try your best type attitude. At least that's how

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:31.280
I feel. I don't know. You feel that, Jamie? Or is it just me? I'm sorry, she's watching.

01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:33.800
What about you, Loki? Have you been to play at Spigold?

01:36:33.800 --> 01:36:56.800
Uh, a few times. It's too cramped for my taste. They have way too many machines in a way too small arcade. That's the only thing I got from it. Um, but, I don't know. They have In the Groove now. I guess that's not, I don't know. I wouldn't want to play In the Groove, but you know, that's just me.

01:36:56.800 --> 01:37:04.680
But, you know, honestly, I would rather them put in the groove in that cabinet that's broken

01:37:04.680 --> 01:37:09.720
right now than, you know, have it be just not working at all. You know, I'd rather have

01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:15.720
that cabinet being used for something other than just to sit there broken. And if that's

01:37:15.720 --> 01:37:19.680
what they gotta do, then go ahead, buy the machine, put it in there, so then we can upgrade

01:37:19.680 --> 01:37:24.720
it to mine with working parts.

01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:28.500
And again, I don't want to bash on everybody that goes to Sviggle, I'm not trying to start

01:37:28.500 --> 01:37:33.320
any drama or anything, it's just I've had one too many kind of shitty experiences when

01:37:33.320 --> 01:37:36.540
I was there, so I'm sure there's a lot of great people, in fact I know there's a lot

01:37:36.540 --> 01:37:39.720
of great people that play Sviggle, it's just that there's a lot of attitude that comes

01:37:39.720 --> 01:37:41.840
along with Sviggle, so I don't know.

01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:45.980
As far as In the Groove goes, you know, I talked about the game before on the show,

01:37:45.980 --> 01:37:50.000
I got to play it, and it's okay, there's things I like about it, there's things I don't like

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:51.000
about it.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:54.320
I would rather see In the Groove than nothing, I mean it's a nice little addition, it's something

01:37:54.320 --> 01:37:59.220
I would play once in a while. It's not something I'm going to go gaga over. It is not a replacement

01:37:59.220 --> 01:38:06.080
for DDR, I don't think, but it's something to kind of pass the time. And again, the one

01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:09.600
thing that always kind of bugged me about, excuse me, the one thing that always kind

01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:14.880
of bugged me about In the Groove is that In the Groove is not DDR unless it's convenient

01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:19.120
for it to be DDR. You know what I mean? Like, when it's convenient to say it's the new DDR,

01:38:19.120 --> 01:38:22.800
then it's the new DDR. But when, you know, it's being bashed on, then oh well, you can't

01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:26.360
say that because it's not DDR. It's kind of like, you know, make up your mind, is it DDR

01:38:26.360 --> 01:38:34.360
or not? So, we'll see. Anyway, Jamie, did you have any thoughts on...?

01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:40.160
I'm sorry, I had to take care of some business. That's all right.

01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:44.440
About In the Groove? Anything, either In the Groove or Sviggle

01:38:44.440 --> 01:38:47.120
versus, you know, other places. You know, I, Sviggles, I...

01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:49.880
And not necessarily are Sviggles specifically, just Sviggle in general.

01:38:49.880 --> 01:38:57.220
No offense to the swigglers, but walking into that place is like walking into, you know, a garage that somebody's put too much crap in.

01:38:58.220 --> 01:39:02.380
It's just not comfortable there.

01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:10.980
I'd rather go to Miggle, where there's tons of room, generally nicer, more attentive people, than go waste my time at SVGL.

01:39:11.680 --> 01:39:13.880
No offense to any of my friends that go there.

01:39:17.180 --> 01:39:18.180
That's how I feel.

01:39:18.180 --> 01:39:22.580
All right, well that's what we think. If you disagree, you're welcome to join the chat

01:39:22.580 --> 01:39:27.220
or call us on the Skyline a little later. Anyway, meanwhile, you guys want to figure

01:39:27.220 --> 01:39:29.420
out who won the cage match? Yes, sir.

01:39:29.420 --> 01:39:35.180
All right, we're going to go to cage match and the winner is... This is a very unique

01:39:35.180 --> 01:39:42.300
situation. Tonight, in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, we had a three-way tie.

01:39:42.300 --> 01:39:46.800
No way! Three-way tie, and a lot of people voted tonight,

01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:49.240
And it's still a three-way tie.

01:39:49.240 --> 01:39:51.080
Here's the weird thing.

01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:53.080
Typically in a three-way tie,

01:39:53.080 --> 01:39:57.160
then the song that got thrown out, whoever put that song in, gets to vote on

01:39:57.160 --> 01:39:58.380
the winner.

01:39:58.380 --> 01:39:59.520
But the problem is,

01:39:59.520 --> 01:40:03.760
there is no song being thrown out this week because they're three brand new songs.

01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:05.960
So we have to go to Plan B.

01:40:05.960 --> 01:40:09.120
And basically what happens in Plan B, and I think this has only ever happened one

01:40:09.120 --> 01:40:10.560
time in show history,

01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:13.240
is that everybody else in the room who isn't a host

01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:15.400
gets to vote on the song that wins.

01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:18.200
but we only have one person which means there's only one other person here in

01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:18.960
the room tonight

01:40:18.960 --> 01:40:22.400
that means angel is going to break the tie so I gave her a little piece of

01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:22.960
paper

01:40:22.960 --> 01:40:26.840
she's gonna write down on there her favorite song

01:40:26.840 --> 01:40:32.760
to win tonight's cage match no pressure

01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:39.760
but she's thinking about her vote

01:40:39.760 --> 01:40:47.360
That's right.

01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:49.720
She's walking to her pen.

01:40:49.720 --> 01:40:54.280
She's writing it down on the piece of paper.

01:40:54.280 --> 01:40:55.280
All right.

01:40:55.280 --> 01:40:56.680
She's got it?

01:40:56.680 --> 01:40:57.680
Okay.

01:40:57.680 --> 01:40:59.760
I have the vote in my hand.

01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:06.000
Remember, once the votes are tallied, the other two songs have to leave.

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:10.600
I will now read the vote.

01:41:10.600 --> 01:41:17.600
The winning song of tonight's cage match as decided on by DDR Angel.

01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:19.920
Is there any particular, oh I have to ask you first, is there any particular reason

01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:21.800
you voted for this song?

01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:22.800
No.

01:41:22.800 --> 01:41:23.800
Alright.

01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:30.960
Let's see, shall I walk over to the cam?

01:41:30.960 --> 01:41:31.960
Sure.

01:41:31.960 --> 01:41:32.960
Alright.

01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:36.960
This is a big moment in Orange Launch Radio History.

01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:44.960
Let's see, here we go.

01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:52.960
And the winning song for tonight is

01:41:52.960 --> 01:41:59.960
song number one. Song number one.

01:41:59.960 --> 01:42:08.440
So, that means by a three-way tie-breaker. See, now everyone's dying in the chat room.

01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:12.400
What have I done? Bitch wins the cage match, which is ironic

01:42:12.400 --> 01:42:15.840
because it's the song that got dogged on the most by the chat room.

01:42:15.840 --> 01:42:27.000
Hold on, I gotta play the victory lap here. Bitch wins tonight's cage match.

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:32.000
Any particular reason you picked that one? You gave that one the lowest score out of the three, so I'm kind of surprised that you voted for that one.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:37.000
Well, I kind of thought of it and, well, I don't know, I kind of like it. It's kind of...

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:42.000
Well, it's more, I guess you could call it a club song, I don't know.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:45.000
Most dancey out of the three, I guess?

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:50.000
That actually makes me happy because the chat room was so, like, anti-that song.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
See, they don't like it too bad!

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:57.000
You guys voted for it in a three-way tie. If any one of you had voted differently, it would have been different.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:58.000
I'm kidding. I love you, chat room.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
Alright, there you have it.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:03.000
Alright, so Bitch will be back next week with two new songs.

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:06.000
That was good, though. We don't get three-way ties very often.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:11.000
But it was an exact- it was a multiple of three votes and every one had the same amount. It's crazy.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
Wasn't this one like the second time it's happened or something?

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
I think it's only like the second time it's happened. Ever.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:16.000
Yeah.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:17.000
Alright.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
I feel special now. Yay!

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:48.800
The first ever versions of songs that have been remixed to the point of making people

01:43:48.800 --> 01:43:56.520
physically ill. Like, paranoia. Wow, okay. Wow, that is a crazy theme, okay, but we can

01:43:56.520 --> 01:44:04.000
do that. Max 300. Okay. Pre-remix. Alright. And, and actually, just for the hell of it,

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:09.080
because I hadn't heard it in forever, dropout. Even though that has nothing to do with...

01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:11.840
Even though. Alright. Because I can't think of any others. Oh my god, I don't think I

01:44:11.840 --> 01:44:15.440
have the original paranoia, it's not in the potpourri directory. Okay, okay, I'll tell

01:44:15.440 --> 01:44:16.440
Trip Machine.

01:44:16.440 --> 01:44:17.440
Want a Trip Machine?

01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:18.440
Do I have a Trip Machine?

01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:19.440
I don't have a Trip Machine.

01:44:19.440 --> 01:44:20.440
Alright.

01:44:20.440 --> 01:44:21.440
We'll do $300.

01:44:21.440 --> 01:44:22.440
No, that's it.

01:44:22.440 --> 01:44:23.440
Um, throw in QQQ.

01:44:23.440 --> 01:44:24.440
Cuckoo.

01:44:24.440 --> 01:44:25.440
For no good reason.

01:44:25.440 --> 01:44:26.440
Thank you.

01:44:26.440 --> 01:44:27.440
For no good reason.

01:44:27.440 --> 01:44:28.440
For no good reason.

01:44:28.440 --> 01:44:29.440
It's, it's Taku.

01:44:29.440 --> 01:44:30.440
I will say thank you for that.

01:44:30.440 --> 01:44:31.440
Haha pun.

01:44:31.440 --> 01:44:32.440
Shoot me.

01:44:32.440 --> 01:44:43.440
We'll be right back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

01:44:43.440 --> 01:44:50.440
go.

01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:52.440
Think about the dance now Think, think about the dance now

01:48:13.440 --> 01:48:15.440
you

01:49:43.440 --> 01:49:57.320
Orange Lounge Radio is proud to present a celebrity interview.

01:49:57.320 --> 01:49:59.180
Can you introduce yourself for our listeners?

01:49:59.180 --> 01:50:00.180
I'm Miss Cleo.

01:50:00.180 --> 01:50:02.440
Oh, it's great to have you on the show today.

01:50:02.440 --> 01:50:04.080
Hello, how are you today?

01:50:04.080 --> 01:50:05.200
I'm great, thanks.

01:50:05.200 --> 01:50:06.520
Did you have a question?

01:50:06.520 --> 01:50:09.120
Well, yes, actually I wanted to know.

01:50:09.120 --> 01:50:13.120
Can I please have your first name only and your birth date, please?

01:50:13.120 --> 01:50:18.120
Uh, well, no, I actually just wanted to know what you thought of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:50:18.120 --> 01:50:20.120
Alright, go ahead.

01:50:20.120 --> 01:50:23.120
Well, what do you think of Loki, one of the three hosts of Orange Lounge Radio?

01:50:23.120 --> 01:50:25.120
Is he incarcerated?

01:50:25.120 --> 01:50:29.120
Uh, actually, no, he's not, but what do you think of the ever-ranty Dark Zakra?

01:50:29.120 --> 01:50:30.120
Hi, dear, how are you?

01:50:30.120 --> 01:50:32.120
I love you.

01:50:32.120 --> 01:50:35.120
I see you two must know each other. Well, what do you think of Sky?

01:50:35.120 --> 01:50:37.120
Did he used to play football when he was in high school?

01:50:37.120 --> 01:50:38.120
Well, actually, no, he didn't.

01:50:38.120 --> 01:50:41.120
Well, what do you think of Intern Zero?

01:50:41.120 --> 01:50:45.120
I want you to really remember the pill, all right?

01:50:45.120 --> 01:50:47.120
I'm seeing some forgetting, possibly.

01:50:47.120 --> 01:50:51.120
And I'm seeing a new baby in the next three months.

01:50:51.120 --> 01:50:55.120
Right. Okay, well, thanks for being on Orange Lounge Radio today.

01:50:55.120 --> 01:50:57.120
Um, I don't mean to sidetrack your question here,

01:50:57.120 --> 01:51:00.120
but who are all of these nosy people,

01:51:00.120 --> 01:51:04.120
outside influences I'm seeing around you by the moon card?

01:51:04.120 --> 01:51:07.120
Get away from me.

01:51:07.120 --> 01:51:12.720
Orange Lounge Radio, helping to free your mind and spirit.

01:51:12.720 --> 01:51:15.320
I'm Miss Cleo, I love you!

01:51:19.320 --> 01:51:22.620
We are back, here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:51:22.620 --> 01:51:25.720
Episode number 122, In Progress.

01:51:25.720 --> 01:51:29.220
Can't believe we've been doing this crap this long, can you believe that?

01:51:29.220 --> 01:51:32.920
I like your shirt there, Angel, that you're wearing. The old

01:51:32.920 --> 01:51:36.680
classic Nintendo controller there with the know your roots I've seen that for

01:51:36.680 --> 01:51:37.520
sale before

01:51:37.520 --> 01:51:41.360
yeah it's nice you're around but

01:51:41.360 --> 01:51:45.960
you know I mean you always wear some kinda 8-bit shirt when you come over

01:51:45.960 --> 01:51:47.160
here I know this I just

01:51:47.160 --> 01:51:51.240
I kinda notice this trend you got you have your we do you are you going to

01:51:51.240 --> 01:51:53.920
make a man sure you have that you have the Piranha Plant this is bite me

01:51:53.920 --> 01:51:57.800
and then it's bite me I have the

01:51:57.800 --> 01:52:01.440
was I got mad bills which is the bullet bill one

01:52:01.440 --> 01:52:17.440
The only one I have is the Goomba one that says you lose, because I like that one. I actually wore that to the live 365 awards, so that was kind of an omen that year.

01:52:17.440 --> 01:52:26.400
Yup, and the same day that I had picked up the Bite Me shirt, I washed it and wore it

01:52:26.400 --> 01:52:31.680
over here that night, and you were wearing your Hulu shirt, so it kind of...

01:52:31.680 --> 01:52:32.680
Oh yeah, I remember that.

01:52:32.680 --> 01:52:33.680
You were!

01:52:33.680 --> 01:52:34.680
Oh, we were twins!

01:52:34.680 --> 01:52:35.680
It was so cute!

01:52:35.680 --> 01:52:36.680
Yay!

01:52:36.680 --> 01:52:37.680
We were twins!

01:52:37.680 --> 01:52:39.080
I liked the Nintendo shirts when they were underground, though.

01:52:39.080 --> 01:52:42.360
I mean, not that they're not cute now, but you know, it was better when they weren't,

01:52:42.360 --> 01:52:45.800
you know, like, you'd seen them all at Hot Topic already and stuff, you know?

01:52:45.800 --> 01:52:48.800
There's actually another store that's carrying gaming shirts now.

01:52:48.800 --> 01:52:49.600
Oh, who's that?

01:52:49.600 --> 01:52:51.500
Uh, T-Shirts Plus.

01:52:51.500 --> 01:52:53.640
That must be a local thing.

01:52:53.640 --> 01:52:57.040
Well, it might not be a local thing, but, uh,

01:52:57.040 --> 01:52:58.860
I can't remember which, like,

01:52:58.860 --> 01:53:00.600
mall it is around here.

01:53:00.600 --> 01:53:07.600
Dang it. Alright, well, I'll just have to take your word for it, I suppose. I believe it's Arden, actually, now that I think about it.

01:53:07.740 --> 01:53:09.720
Alright, um, let's see,

01:53:09.720 --> 01:53:13.100
we're gonna go on over to Loki, if you don't mind,

01:53:13.100 --> 01:53:20.100
And I was curious what's going on in the Sims scene right now, besides the dancing characters, of course. Is there any other news going on out there right now?

01:53:20.100 --> 01:53:29.100
Besides numerous websites being down, not really, no. No, really, actually, nothing's going on at all.

01:53:29.100 --> 01:53:38.100
I couldn't really tell you any updates on Step Mini. I don't think there have been any new releases of it since Release Candidate 2, if I remember correctly.

01:53:38.100 --> 01:53:56.100
I know that they're still hard at work over on DDRUK on getting those sim files out for, was it, a Dancing Stage Fusion and, let's see, DDRFestival and Ultramix 2. Those are almost done.

01:53:56.100 --> 01:54:10.100
I think Festival is close to being done, they're waiting on graphics, and Ultramix 2 they're still working on, and I would assume by now that Fusion's done it, because that game's been out forever now.

01:54:10.100 --> 01:54:21.100
I think they're just gonna be doing like one update where they have them all up online, but still nothing yet on those, but should be soon, hopefully.

01:54:21.100 --> 01:54:27.100
And then, um, really, other than that, I don't think there's anything else going on, sort of sim-related.

01:54:27.100 --> 01:54:36.100
Um, FoodMix Plus, um, it was just announced, actually, that they were going to be releasing, of course, exclusively in Japan,

01:54:36.100 --> 01:54:42.100
um, a soundtrack for FoodMix Plus and FoodMix, I guess, that's going to be out there.

01:54:42.100 --> 01:54:46.100
There's a little demo on the FoodMix site, I don't remember the URL by chance right now,

01:54:46.100 --> 01:54:49.820
now but that's gonna be coming out eventually with all extended tracks and

01:54:49.820 --> 01:54:56.340
stuff from your favorite food mix artists and really other than that not

01:54:56.340 --> 01:55:00.980
much going on right now pretty quiet that food mix soundtrack sounds pretty

01:55:00.980 --> 01:55:04.380
exciting though I'd be looking forward to that food mix is some good stuff and

01:55:04.380 --> 01:55:08.740
not just there and I wouldn't even call them Bahmani remixes because they're

01:55:08.740 --> 01:55:11.740
they're almost these completely different songs that are just kind of

01:55:11.740 --> 01:55:15.980
inspired by familiar Bahmani tunes not just those but their original stuff is

01:55:15.980 --> 01:55:19.540
freaking great too so hats off to those guys for putting a soundtrack together

01:55:19.540 --> 01:55:24.080
and as I mentioned probably last week in the week before last and so on and so

01:55:24.080 --> 01:55:29.820
forth there's the brand new diverse systems album that's coming out called

01:55:29.820 --> 01:55:35.340
and this was as you may remember dear mr. 180 well now we have dear mr. desire

01:55:35.340 --> 01:55:39.740
which is all remixes which is ironically enough it's remixes of revenge and

01:55:39.740 --> 01:55:45.100
desire songs so get all your trip machine cigar ooh and healing vision

01:55:45.100 --> 01:55:52.940
remixes out there they're all on this one CD here from diverse systems and

01:55:52.940 --> 01:55:57.300
also the food mix CD should be available through silly Walker which is another

01:55:57.300 --> 01:56:02.860
diverse systems like site fortunately all these sites being located in Japan

01:56:02.860 --> 01:56:07.100
they're only selling you know exclusively in Japan so it's really hard

01:56:07.100 --> 01:56:11.380
to get a hold of this stuff especially if you don't speak Japanese it's pretty

01:56:11.380 --> 01:56:18.180
hard to find it, but it's out there, so, you know, try your best. I know that Diverse Systems

01:56:18.180 --> 01:56:24.820
is re-updating their entire English page, so I'm sure that D7 along with, you know,

01:56:24.820 --> 01:56:29.320
this brand new album should be up there eventually as soon as they get done with that, probably

01:56:29.320 --> 01:56:30.320
next year.

01:56:30.320 --> 01:56:40.140
Alright, good times. Moving right along, excuse me. You know, going back to a topic that we

01:56:40.140 --> 01:56:46.860
we had going on earlier in this show, John, you know John in our chat room, he actually

01:56:46.860 --> 01:56:51.140
went to the OC Remix and got one of them to come over here to try and talk you into, I

01:56:51.140 --> 01:56:55.140
don't know if they're here to talk you into it or what, but answer any questions you may

01:56:55.140 --> 01:56:59.900
have about the OC Remix policy. You know what, Loki? I think you're just going to have to

01:56:59.900 --> 01:57:00.900
do it.

01:57:00.900 --> 01:57:04.820
I don't care. I just don't think it's, you know, usually...

01:57:04.820 --> 01:57:06.500
You think you're not worthy, is that what it is?

01:57:06.500 --> 01:57:07.500
I guess.

01:57:07.500 --> 01:57:11.500
Yes. You've got all these listeners telling you you're worthy. Just do it!

01:57:11.500 --> 01:57:15.500
Do it! Do it, Loki! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!

01:57:15.500 --> 01:57:19.500
Yes. That's the spirit. Yay!

01:57:19.500 --> 01:57:23.500
Alright. So you guys can be looking forward to that.

01:57:23.500 --> 01:57:27.500
I think it would be funny if we went through all that and then they say,

01:57:27.500 --> 01:57:31.500
Oh, sorry. This sucks. I'd laugh.

01:57:31.500 --> 01:57:35.500
Hey, it would give us good material for next week's show, so I'm down for it.

01:57:35.500 --> 01:57:39.500
Good luck to you, Loki. I hope it works out for you. I think that'll be fun.

01:57:39.500 --> 01:57:45.500
Alright. Oh, John's going all the way to the top. Look at that.

01:57:45.500 --> 01:57:50.500
That guy's crazy. That guy's your biggest fan. Look at that.

01:57:50.500 --> 01:57:55.500
Loki's turning red. I'd better change the subject.

01:57:55.500 --> 01:58:00.500
Yes, Loki. Since we gotta get to actual news now.

01:58:00.500 --> 01:58:29.500
You know, so we do all this fun stuff and then get back to some actual news. The full unlock list for 2DX Red has been released actually. With some interesting information here, we've got all the hidden songs. So we have, you know, Agia by Ryu, Blox by Sparker, The Hope of Tomorrow by Sota, Earth Escape by DJ Taka, Ultimate by Terra, Fake Time by DJ RemoCon.

01:58:29.500 --> 01:58:50.220
RemoCon, and Close My Eyes For Me by D. Crew featuring Dennis Gunn. And also with Hidden

01:58:50.220 --> 01:58:58.900
and Others for Double A, Andromeda, and Gigadelic. I told Navi, and if you're out there listening

01:58:58.900 --> 01:59:04.320
Navi, you pop and music horror friend of mine, and 2DX horror part-time. I told you when

01:59:04.320 --> 01:59:08.160
you said that there were not a whole lot of others in 2DX Red, I said, they're probably

01:59:08.160 --> 01:59:16.040
hidden. I told you so, I told you so, I told you so. Thank you. Anyways, also should mention,

01:59:16.040 --> 01:59:20.960
since it's sort of Bomani-related, exclusively through BomaniStyle.com, they're gonna be

01:59:20.960 --> 01:59:27.760
releasing Slake's new album. And Slake, for those who you might not know, is an old-school

01:59:27.760 --> 01:59:36.300
Bamani Artist. Anyways, some of the titles for these songs here, Past Oriental Mechanist,

01:59:36.300 --> 01:59:44.900
The Fading of Light, Justified, Rush, I Am a Clone, and looks like Astro, I can't even

01:59:44.900 --> 01:59:50.660
pronounce that, Astro Oxy Remix. Anyways, and those should be coming soon. They're doing

01:59:50.660 --> 01:59:55.060
some stupid little contests here where you get to design like the cover and yada yada

01:59:55.060 --> 02:00:01.880
got it. So go to Bumicell, check it out. Here's a little clip of Slake, if you're unfamiliar

02:00:01.880 --> 02:00:04.880
with Slake. Here's a little clip of Cloudy Music from Seventh Style.

02:00:04.880 --> 02:00:23.880
So I don't know what exactly you would call Slake's style of music. It's just, it's funky

02:00:23.880 --> 02:00:27.680
beats I think would be a good way of putting a classifying slate you can't

02:00:27.680 --> 02:00:39.180
really classify him he's pretty fun guy yeah so I don't know but anyways huh so

02:00:39.180 --> 02:00:45.600
I think that's pretty much all the news Oh Poppins 12 I don't know a little

02:00:45.600 --> 02:00:49.280
piece of news I want to share going on actually this is posted to our site by

02:00:49.280 --> 02:00:53.040
our very own news guy dark Tetsuya who does a lot of the news for the site we

02:00:53.040 --> 02:00:56.300
really appreciate him helping out over orange laundry calm I don't know if you

02:00:56.300 --> 02:00:59.760
guys remember this but way back in the beginnings of the show I'm talking like

02:00:59.760 --> 02:01:03.460
two years ago back in the first like 10 20 episodes you guys remember twin

02:01:03.460 --> 02:01:10.500
galaxies yeah I noticed that that back yeah twin galaxies now they are the site

02:01:10.500 --> 02:01:15.540
that does all the high scores for games video games I'm not talking about just

02:01:15.540 --> 02:01:18.340
like new video games I'm talking about old video games too we actually probably

02:01:18.340 --> 02:01:22.140
the last time we brought them up on the show was during classic gaming Expo

02:01:22.140 --> 02:01:27.240
earlier this year. Remember when we all participated in the Stampede challenge? Which, by the way,

02:01:27.240 --> 02:01:30.520
I never checked to see if the scores were on, because I, are they?

02:01:30.520 --> 02:01:36.000
They were, and you did check. Oh, okay, I don't remember. I'm going to have

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:39.720
to pull that up again, because I remember that I was in, like, the bottom three. I swear

02:01:39.720 --> 02:01:43.640
I did so horrible at Stampede. I was somewhere in, like, the teens for the

02:01:43.640 --> 02:01:49.320
rankings for Gradius 5 also. Very, very nice. How does that make your internet

02:01:49.320 --> 02:01:53.840
penis field, to be in the top 20 Gradius 5 players, officially.

02:01:53.840 --> 02:01:58.120
That's pretty sad since I don't play Gradius, Gradius 5, that was the first time I'd ever

02:01:58.120 --> 02:02:05.880
played Gradius 5. That's not saying much.

02:02:05.880 --> 02:02:11.880
Alright, so Twin Galaxies is back in the news. Apparently, a brand new record has been set,

02:02:11.880 --> 02:02:19.280
and I'm actually going to the link, which is a link actually to a post over on aaroninjapan.com,

02:02:19.280 --> 02:02:22.620
And they actually quote, and if you want to see all this for yourself, it's all posted

02:02:22.620 --> 02:02:23.980
over at OrangeLawnTrader.com.

02:02:23.980 --> 02:02:28.780
They actually posted a story from Twin Galaxies, where apparently, what is the guy's name?

02:02:28.780 --> 02:02:34.960
Gregory Cantor of Pennsylvania in the US, hey that's where I spent some time this year.

02:02:34.960 --> 02:02:39.740
You know, funny enough, I didn't see any good DDR machines while I was out there, but apparently

02:02:39.740 --> 02:02:44.460
I was checking all the wrong places, so it was my own damn fault, but this guy in Pennsylvania

02:02:44.460 --> 02:02:51.820
has just set the new record for DDR Extreme. And basically the way the rules work, this

02:02:51.820 --> 02:02:56.380
is the way the official rules work for you to get ranked. You have to be playing on easy,

02:02:56.380 --> 02:03:02.340
difficulty three. It's a five song set. Game over has to be turned on. You get to play

02:03:02.340 --> 02:03:06.640
your choice of songs, but you have to be on heavy mode. The gamer is allowed to take as

02:03:06.640 --> 02:03:12.640
much time in between sets as the timer allows. No song can be picked more than two times

02:03:12.640 --> 02:03:17.020
in the performance. The selection and sequence of songs is the player's choice. Player's

02:03:17.020 --> 02:03:21.920
hands may not touch the dance pad. The bar is okay though. Only the player's feet may

02:03:21.920 --> 02:03:27.600
touch the dance pad. So this is how the guy did it. He played max 300, max unlimited,

02:03:27.600 --> 02:03:33.280
Sakura, bag, paranoia rebirth. So basically he played every 10 footer in the game. Is

02:03:33.280 --> 02:03:40.160
rebirth a 10 or is rebirth a 9? So he played, are you sure? Alright, so he played four 10s

02:03:40.160 --> 02:03:46.720
was a nine. And he ended up with a, what were they, actually, if you read on in the thread

02:03:46.720 --> 02:03:50.000
they don't think it's Tsugaru, they think it's actually Sakura, not Tsugaru, which will

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:53.820
make more sense anyway for somebody to pick Sakura because it's a ten. So this guy got

02:03:53.820 --> 02:03:59.760
a score of 375,311,150 points, which is a lot of points. I know a lot of you guys don't

02:03:59.760 --> 02:04:03.880
keep track of your points on DDR, you're all about the number of greats and things like

02:04:03.880 --> 02:04:09.520
that, but this guy did a pretty good job. I believe the person that had had the record

02:04:09.520 --> 02:04:16.180
before this was Yasu. If I'm not mistaking, didn't he remember when we first brought this

02:04:16.180 --> 02:04:20.060
up on the show it was some other guy who had a really, really low record and we were all

02:04:20.060 --> 02:04:23.780
making fun of how we were going to beat it. And then Yasu came in and kicked all our asses

02:04:23.780 --> 02:04:28.660
basically. So that's why this is such big news. If, if I recall, and I may be wrong,

02:04:28.660 --> 02:04:33.040
but, because maybe it's a Max 2 versus Extreme thing, I don't know. You know any more about

02:04:33.040 --> 02:04:34.040
this, Logie?

02:04:34.040 --> 02:04:37.700
That was Max 2 and I remember correctly and the rules were different then. I think the

02:04:37.700 --> 02:04:43.700
the rules where you can't play a song more than twice in a row. Or twice, I think. Because

02:04:43.700 --> 02:04:48.420
I think he played Max Unlimited twice or something like that. I don't know. It was stupid. Twin

02:04:48.420 --> 02:05:00.420
Galaxies is stupid. I really don't care. That's my take on it. Very interesting. And now I'm

02:05:00.420 --> 02:05:05.980
getting a message in our chat room over at www.orangelandtrader.com from DarkTetsuya.

02:05:05.980 --> 02:05:11.200
Oh, sorry guys, it was Take, not Yasu that set the bar there, sorry.

02:05:11.200 --> 02:05:16.260
You know what, both of them are insanely good at DDR, it's easy to get them confused because

02:05:16.260 --> 02:05:20.260
you always hear about them together, you always hear about the two of them, so sorry about

02:05:20.260 --> 02:05:21.260
that.

02:05:21.260 --> 02:05:22.260
My bad, my bad.

02:05:22.260 --> 02:05:27.900
But Dark Tetsuya says, uh, it seems like he may not have gotten parental permission.

02:05:27.900 --> 02:05:34.340
And I didn't know, I certainly didn't have parental permission when I played Stampede.

02:05:34.340 --> 02:05:38.720
My mother doesn't know I do this garbage. I don't know. You have to have parental permission

02:05:38.720 --> 02:05:42.160
to be on a high score list? Is that what they're trying to say?

02:05:42.160 --> 02:05:49.160
Something about child privacy law? Geez. That's kind of lame. I'm sorry, but

02:05:49.960 --> 02:05:53.720
I think that's lame. Alright, we're going to go to a break, guys,

02:05:53.720 --> 02:05:57.480
so when we come back from this break, we're going to get into the FUs of the week, because

02:05:57.480 --> 02:06:02.600
we have to do that segment every week, because we're just angsty. We're angsty, angsty people,

02:06:02.600 --> 02:06:03.760
and we have to get it out

02:06:03.760 --> 02:06:06.880
uh... in this break we're getting here

02:06:06.880 --> 02:06:09.520

Orange Lounge Radio.

02:08:21.600 --> 02:08:51.120
One, two, three, four!

02:08:51.120 --> 02:09:19.340
Yeah

02:09:49.340 --> 02:09:51.340
You

02:11:19.340 --> 02:11:21.340
Oh

02:11:49.340 --> 02:12:03.380
Hi ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

02:12:03.380 --> 02:12:13.180
is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

02:12:13.180 --> 02:12:17.060
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and a little follow-up to something we were talking

02:12:17.060 --> 02:12:18.420
about earlier in the show.

02:12:18.420 --> 02:12:22.620
I was actually checking out DERFreak over in the RViggle thread, I remember how we were

02:12:22.620 --> 02:12:25.540
talking about 2DX possibly coming to Roswell Golf Land.

02:12:25.540 --> 02:12:29.340
Our old buddy Iguana Girl, who's been on the show before, she actually made a post here

02:12:29.340 --> 02:12:34.340
that says, I saw the precious precious sitting back in the tech room today.

02:12:34.340 --> 02:12:38.140
It's a nice pretty little 2DX machine missing the monitor because they're replacing it.

02:12:38.140 --> 02:12:41.380
It's currently in 8 style, but who knows what it'll be when it's up and running.

02:12:41.380 --> 02:12:45.580
I smooched it to tell it I love it, and yes I humped it too, just like I did the Scandia

02:12:45.580 --> 02:12:46.780
8 style when it first came in.

02:12:46.780 --> 02:12:49.900
That's so good to know now.

02:12:49.900 --> 02:12:51.060
So there it is.

02:12:51.060 --> 02:12:53.380
It's got wifey poo humping on it.

02:12:53.380 --> 02:12:53.880
Great.

02:12:53.880 --> 02:12:54.380
That's happy.

02:12:54.380 --> 02:12:57.460
Girl cooties on the 2DX machine.

02:12:57.460 --> 02:12:58.260
Just kidding.

02:12:58.260 --> 02:13:00.940
That makes it all the better.

02:13:00.940 --> 02:13:02.060
So that's pretty exciting.

02:13:02.060 --> 02:13:02.740
So there it is.

02:13:02.740 --> 02:13:05.420
That's about as close to a confirmation as you can get.

02:13:05.420 --> 02:13:10.060
When iguana girls hump it, you know it's the real deal.

02:13:10.060 --> 02:13:12.260
All right.

02:13:12.260 --> 02:13:13.780
So anyway, moving right along, I guess

02:13:13.780 --> 02:13:19.420
going to get into the FUs of the week. So we're going to cue that up for you guys.

02:13:19.420 --> 02:13:23.280
Remember, you guys can participate in the FUs of the week by sending a private message

02:13:23.280 --> 02:13:29.520
to me, that's Skye in the chat room with your FU. And Jamie, why is it that we have to do

02:13:29.520 --> 02:13:36.520
these FUs of the Week every single week. We're not going to take it anymore.

02:13:50.520 --> 02:13:57.520
Oh, Big FU toured my overwhelming lack of free time the past week, however, now that

02:13:57.520 --> 02:14:01.900
semester is over and I have one thing left to do it's great but then I just

02:14:01.900 --> 02:14:07.080
realized that the classes that I need to take next semester are full term except

02:14:07.080 --> 02:14:12.000
for one that's going to be second half so I'm going to be really freaking busy

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:21.040
next semester and fu2 there being no free no time off allowed next month but

02:14:21.040 --> 02:14:28.160
I might have to beg some anyway to take care of some school stuff just and if

02:14:28.160 --> 02:14:32.320
you towards all the slow ass people on the road today oh yeah an F each of the

02:14:32.320 --> 02:14:38.680
guy who tried to cut me off in traffic and then feel on his brakes on purpose

02:14:38.680 --> 02:14:43.360
he's tailgating me so I slowed down so he goes around me and then gets it in

02:14:43.360 --> 02:14:47.040
front of me and tries to throw on his brakes that I went into him thing is I

02:14:47.040 --> 02:14:51.720
drive a Tercel with bad brakes I was going 50 you know that would have been

02:14:51.720 --> 02:14:55.920
like lethal so I luckily there's no one in the next place I swerved around them and it

02:14:55.920 --> 02:14:58.640
turns out that I ended up being like five cars ahead of him in traffic anyway

02:14:58.640 --> 02:15:07.160
so he got stuck behind like some old people in a Buick and F you toward not

02:15:07.160 --> 02:15:20.040
having money time and certain things yeah that's really about it I just want

02:15:20.040 --> 02:15:23.600
to point out for a minute if any of the OC remix people are listening this is

02:15:23.600 --> 02:15:33.720
another one by Loki we're gonna get you we're gonna get you to whore yourself

02:15:33.720 --> 02:15:39.480
yourself out. If you won't do it, damn it, we will. And on that note, let's go over to

02:15:39.480 --> 02:15:40.480
Loki.

02:15:40.480 --> 02:15:48.680
Whatever. I don't even care anymore. Fucking my work for making me bake cookies. I don't

02:15:48.680 --> 02:15:52.520
like extracurricular activities no matter what they are, even if it involves cookies,

02:15:52.520 --> 02:15:56.320
because the cookies I made, I don't like to eat. One, because they taste like lemons.

02:15:56.320 --> 02:16:03.320
because they have nuts in them. It's not my forte. Anyway, um, I guess, fuck you, CarMax

02:16:03.680 --> 02:16:07.920
for taking forever to fix my car. I didn't know, but I guess it takes two days to do

02:16:07.920 --> 02:16:12.080
a fucking brake job. Whoa, what have I been doing? I must have been doing it completely

02:16:12.080 --> 02:16:16.120
wrong because I get mine done in like an hour and a half. The only problem is I didn't know

02:16:16.120 --> 02:16:19.960
I needed a brake job because I didn't know the fuck was wrong with my brake. Come to

02:16:19.960 --> 02:16:25.280
find out, it's actually something when the person before me, or CarMax, who fucking knows,

02:16:25.280 --> 02:16:29.120
my brakes they installed them incorrectly so the retainer clip was broken and thus the

02:16:29.120 --> 02:16:35.600
pad was wearing funny causing me vibration noise thus resulting in my brake being worn

02:16:35.600 --> 02:16:40.240
down on one side not the other side so i needed the front brake job but unfortunately i don't

02:16:40.240 --> 02:16:46.400
have to do a front brake job later because i got done now so good for that um and then

02:16:46.400 --> 02:16:54.880
finally um since i don't really have that many fus this week um fuck you too uh let's see here

02:16:54.880 --> 02:17:05.880
I know it's comin' here, comin', comin'. Um, you know, I can't think of what it was. Um, there's something that was really pissin' me off the other day, but I just cannot remember what it is right now. Um...

02:17:07.880 --> 02:17:18.880
No, I-I don't remember. Oh, fuck, you know, my pads for generating static electricity and causing them not to work, because that's gonna be a pain in the ass to fix, and, uh, yeah, that really sucks.

02:17:18.880 --> 02:17:25.880
So, that's all I've got for now. I'm sure I'll remember more later, but, uh, yeah. That sucks.

02:17:28.880 --> 02:17:29.880
My turn.

02:17:35.880 --> 02:17:41.880
Uh, F you to the fog, because fog is scary. And I don't like driving in the fog, because it's very scary.

02:17:42.880 --> 02:17:43.880
Yes.

02:17:43.880 --> 02:17:45.880
We saw a six car accident in the fog.

02:17:45.880 --> 02:17:48.880
See, the fog is scary!

02:17:48.880 --> 02:17:52.880
Fog is a cruel trick to be playing on us humans, so I say F you to fog.

02:17:52.880 --> 02:17:57.880
And F you to, uh, angst.

02:17:57.880 --> 02:18:03.880
And F you to the fact that I wasn't drinking last night, even though for once I was the person that didn't have to drive,

02:18:03.880 --> 02:18:06.880
so I could have drank all I wanted, but I didn't, because I'm a pussy.

02:18:06.880 --> 02:18:14.880
And, um, F you to complicated situations, because I keep finding myself in them, and I hate that.

02:18:14.880 --> 02:18:18.880
I was going to add something on the fog thing.

02:18:18.880 --> 02:18:24.880
What? A dude in a Mustang broke through one of our neighbor's fences.

02:18:24.880 --> 02:18:29.880
Geez, see? F-Fog. Well, you've seen that exit.

02:18:29.880 --> 02:18:33.880
Yeah. And see, now Seagrid in our chat room is saying,

02:18:33.880 --> 02:18:36.880
Fog is sexy. It reminds me of Silent Hill.

02:18:36.880 --> 02:18:40.880
Not when a zombie comes out and tries to, like, you know, rape you.

02:18:40.880 --> 02:18:44.880
you it's and that's what happens when it's foggy out is you get raped by

02:18:44.880 --> 02:18:51.960
zombies actually I do have to say one thing about fog if I may when I lived in

02:18:51.960 --> 02:18:56.160
Alabama in in college at our dorms there's like a full globe of trees and

02:18:56.160 --> 02:19:00.200
it would get so foggy there would play hide-and-seek in the fog that oh that

02:19:00.200 --> 02:19:05.600
was really cool I would be so afraid of getting raped by zombies in the fog

02:19:05.600 --> 02:19:12.600
right before Silent Hill. Still, zombie raping has been around forever.

02:19:12.600 --> 02:19:15.600
Well, that will explain a few people who call where I work.

02:19:15.600 --> 02:19:19.600
Alright, let's move on. Angel, you're FUs.

02:19:19.600 --> 02:19:26.600
Um, yeah, I'll add another FU to the difficult situation thing, just because I hate that.

02:19:26.600 --> 02:19:37.440
Um, F you to, um, yeah, F you to a parent that wants to be there but never was to begin

02:19:37.440 --> 02:19:38.440
with.

02:19:38.440 --> 02:19:44.360
I'm not talking about my parents, I'm talking about, um, my significant other's, uh, certain

02:19:44.360 --> 02:19:45.360
parents.

02:19:45.360 --> 02:19:50.800
Um, and, uh, you know what, they don't want you there, so stop trying, cause you never

02:19:50.800 --> 02:19:51.800
tried anyway.

02:19:51.800 --> 02:19:53.800
And, uh, that's it.

02:19:53.800 --> 02:19:54.800
Alright.

02:19:54.800 --> 02:19:58.880
All right, let's go on to the chat room FUs then

02:19:59.960 --> 02:20:04.280
Dork says F you to myself for having a girl over and not doing anything about it

02:20:06.400 --> 02:20:08.320

Darkknight says, my F.U. goes to the Greedy American Cable Company for trying to make

02:20:35.860 --> 02:20:41.880
EvilMaoki2Dx says, F.U. to DarklionXVI for pointing out that Noria has crooked teeth

02:20:41.880 --> 02:20:46.760

02:21:48.460 --> 02:21:55.460
Illusion says FU to waking up at 4.30 in the morning because of a nightmare of some weird guy strangling a woman with floss.

02:21:55.460 --> 02:21:59.460
Oh well, it led to my new short story being written.

02:21:59.460 --> 02:22:03.460

02:22:31.940 --> 02:22:34.120
I'd rather play on shitty pads than not at all

02:22:34.120 --> 02:22:39.120
Nice to see you finally give a damn about the machine's maintenance, though, and of course, F the cage match.

02:22:39.120 --> 02:22:41.120
You're welcome.

02:22:41.120 --> 02:22:46.120

02:22:46.120 --> 02:22:47.120
Ouch.

02:22:47.120 --> 02:22:53.120
Seagurd says F you to a certain friend and his brother for not coming to terms with each of their sexuality.

02:22:53.120 --> 02:22:55.120

Played my friend's copy and it's the best game ever.

02:23:00.120 --> 02:23:03.120
Wait, when did that come out? WarioWare DS is not out.

02:23:03.120 --> 02:23:14.040
not out. What? Um, not that I know of. Maybe in Japan. Maybe. Maybe in Japan. Details please.

02:23:14.040 --> 02:23:18.480

02:23:39.760 --> 02:23:42.320

02:23:44.040 --> 02:23:49.080
oh they said in the chat room it's the Japanese version of WarioWare DS just

confirmation there and dark Tetsuya says f you to my dance pad it might be broken

02:24:25.120 --> 02:24:30.440
and jazz says f you to Saturday holy crap what a horrible day you were I had

02:24:30.440 --> 02:24:34.240
my first online final at 9 o'clock in the morning so I got up early and went

02:24:34.240 --> 02:24:38.240
to school around 7 so I could get food and study during this process I locked

02:24:38.240 --> 02:24:41.400
my keys in my car and need to call triple-a I would have just called my

02:24:41.400 --> 02:24:44.260
parents but they were conveniently in Reno for the weekend after that I

02:24:44.260 --> 02:24:47.480
completely botched my final and proceed to go home and drown my sorrows and

02:24:47.480 --> 02:24:53.900
sleep in World of Warcraft and after that it got cut off but they have to do

02:24:53.900 --> 02:24:56.540
the world of warcraft i don't want to hear about it anyway

02:24:56.540 --> 02:24:58.200
i'm a little bitter towards that game

02:24:58.200 --> 02:25:03.500
i'm sure it's a great game i've heard a lot of good things about it

02:25:03.500 --> 02:25:04.800
anyway that's it

02:25:04.800 --> 02:25:06.620
i'm looking at the Nevada girl

02:25:06.620 --> 02:25:09.940
and this is the link you had me post in the chatroom earlier during the last broadcast

02:25:09.940 --> 02:25:14.960
there's an eleven year old that killed a twelve year old in her class

02:25:14.960 --> 02:25:19.540
in japan and now she's like an internet celebrity

02:25:19.540 --> 02:25:23.020
and they call her the Nevada girl. I've heard of this girl

02:25:23.020 --> 02:25:26.720
sometimes time time i guess what happened to her

02:25:26.720 --> 02:25:29.800
well they can't really do anything to her because the uh... age of criminal

02:25:29.800 --> 02:25:32.040
responsibility in japan is fourteen

02:25:32.040 --> 02:25:34.000
which actually was lowered from sixteen

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:40.180
wait so when you kill somebody you can't be prosecuted

02:25:40.180 --> 02:25:42.880
but they're still trying to decide what to do with her

02:25:42.880 --> 02:25:44.800
uh...

02:25:44.800 --> 02:25:45.840
but uh...

02:25:45.840 --> 02:25:50.200
apparently she's a big internet celebrity now in japan and there's all kinds of fan art about her

02:25:50.200 --> 02:25:56.880
I did post the links in my live journal, including a bunch of the fan art.

02:25:56.880 --> 02:26:05.840
The site, and if someone will just retype this for me, it's www.shrinemaiden.com, slash,

02:26:05.840 --> 02:26:13.760
and it's all in caps, Nevada underscore, and then capital A, the rest is lowercase, R-T-W-O-R-K.

02:26:13.760 --> 02:26:14.760
I lost you.

02:26:14.760 --> 02:26:15.760
Sorry.

02:26:15.760 --> 02:26:19.760
www.shrinemaiden.com

02:26:19.760 --> 02:26:23.760
slash, and then Nevada is all

02:26:23.760 --> 02:26:27.760
capitalized, underscore, N-E-V-A-D-A like

02:26:27.760 --> 02:26:31.760
the state. Nevada, okay, underscore. And then Artwork, capital A.

02:26:31.760 --> 02:26:35.760
The rest is lowercase. That's the site. That's it?

02:26:35.760 --> 02:26:39.760
That's all that they had art.

02:26:39.760 --> 02:26:43.760
There it is, in the chat room, just for you guys.

02:26:43.760 --> 02:26:48.920
that yeah that's it I have some suggestions from the chat room dark night

02:26:48.920 --> 02:26:51.120
says here's a suggestion send her to a shrink

02:26:51.120 --> 02:26:58.760
Ram says the girl needs counseling big time there you go apparently she killed

02:26:58.760 --> 02:27:04.520
her with a box cutter hope you have a pleasant Sunday night everybody but I

02:27:04.520 --> 02:27:08.580
just find it funny that there's all kinds like look at one of these Rob okay

02:27:08.580 --> 02:27:17.460
I'm looking. She looks so sweet and innocent. She looks sweet and innocent and chibi in

02:27:17.460 --> 02:27:22.900
that picture and she's holding a little box cutter behind her back. That is, that's disturbing.

02:27:22.900 --> 02:27:31.660
That is downright scary. Oh my god. Ugh. Loki, why do you find that so damn funny? Because

02:27:31.660 --> 02:27:35.660
She has a box cutter and she killed a kid, and now she's famous.

02:27:35.660 --> 02:27:37.660
That's sad! It's not funny, it's sad!

02:27:37.660 --> 02:27:43.660
Yeah, really, she's not like the ugly, red-headed kid that killed some stupid kid and then posed his body in, like, uh...

02:27:43.660 --> 02:27:46.660
He was on, uh, 48 hours last night.

02:27:46.660 --> 02:27:49.660
Okay, let's go up on the webcam now.

02:27:51.660 --> 02:27:56.660
And the webcam, of course, is available over at www.orangelongeradio.com.

02:27:56.660 --> 02:28:00.660
And please don't get to see my uber-leet precious... my laptop.

02:28:00.660 --> 02:28:04.660
Alright, we're going to go to a break, and when we come back, why don't we do some Ask

02:28:04.660 --> 02:28:05.940
Orange Lounge? How's that sound?

02:28:05.940 --> 02:28:10.020
Works for me. Yeah. And we'll open up the Skype line as well

02:28:10.020 --> 02:28:15.660
for some comments. In this break, I've been letting Jamie pick all the songs tonight, so we're going to do some songs I want to hear now.

02:28:15.660 --> 02:28:19.180
And we're going to start off with Candy. I want to hear Candy.

02:28:19.180 --> 02:28:22.580
And it's Happy. And

02:28:22.580 --> 02:28:27.220
when I hear Candy, I think of killing people with box cutters, so here you go.

02:28:27.220 --> 02:28:30.300
We'll be back. Can we call you Rob Tan?

02:28:30.300 --> 02:28:30.800
heh

02:30:30.300 --> 02:30:37.300
We will live it in your eyes Return all the pages

02:30:37.300 --> 02:30:47.300
If the end comes to us, never end it's only us

02:30:47.300 --> 02:30:54.300
Never end it's only us

02:30:54.300 --> 02:31:08.300
Try to keep their secrets, when I fall behind the clouds

02:31:08.300 --> 02:31:21.300
There upon the rainbow The answer to my never-ending story

02:31:21.300 --> 02:31:28.300
Never ending story

02:32:51.300 --> 02:32:52.300
Hey!

02:32:52.300 --> 02:32:53.300
Hey!

02:32:53.300 --> 02:32:54.300
Hey!

02:32:54.300 --> 02:32:55.300
Hey!

02:32:55.300 --> 02:32:56.300
Hey!

02:32:56.300 --> 02:32:58.300
Hey!

02:33:26.300 --> 02:33:41.300
Orange Lounge Radio, can we put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it?

02:33:41.300 --> 02:33:50.300
My God, you people are scary, looking at that cosplay and dojinshi.

02:33:50.300 --> 02:33:53.300
I'm going to cosplay her in front of me.

02:33:53.300 --> 02:33:58.500
she's 11 years old. What's this talk of cartoon vagina in the chatroom?

02:33:58.500 --> 02:34:02.660
Some of the pictures are of the more hentai nature.

02:34:02.660 --> 02:34:07.580
Gross! As if I didn't have reason enough to be gay.

02:34:07.580 --> 02:34:11.380
Honestly, people. But some of the pictures are just so adorable

02:34:11.380 --> 02:34:15.300
and it's so wrong that there's this whole fandom. Not the hentai one.

02:34:15.300 --> 02:34:19.460
I'm planning on cosplaying in mockery of the fandom.

02:34:19.460 --> 02:34:26.820
Yeah. Sure. So I just got an email from Midihead. Apparently, his broadcast went pretty good,

02:34:26.820 --> 02:34:30.820
but he didn't get a chance to record it. I guess he was having technical difficulties

02:34:30.820 --> 02:34:35.600
right up to the last minute. Hey! Just like this show! What do you know? But maybe we'll

02:34:35.600 --> 02:34:40.180
be able to do something with Midihead another time. Because he's a fun guy. We like him.

02:34:40.180 --> 02:34:45.780
And really, I would love any old DDR artist to be able to use this station as an outlet

02:34:45.780 --> 02:34:50.720
to do some fun stuff because we'll whore ourselves for baloney artists because we like the music

02:34:50.720 --> 02:34:55.860
you guys do. What can we say? That's why we're here. Anyway, one other thing we whore ourselves

02:34:55.860 --> 02:35:01.580
to is the listenership and one way we allow the listeners to give back and be a part of

02:35:01.580 --> 02:35:14.580
the show is to ask Orange Lounge. Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question. What will

02:35:14.580 --> 02:35:17.100
We find out tonight on orange that owns radio

02:35:17.640 --> 02:35:24.700
All I know is that I hope that the station doesn't disconnect because if it does then we won't be having this segment again

02:35:24.940 --> 02:35:26.940
tonight

02:35:32.180 --> 02:35:35.060
Oh my god, there's a picture of who's one of the battle royale girls

02:35:36.140 --> 02:35:42.620
Okay, and jazz is the first question tonight and he's basically asking the same thing. He was just we were just talking about

02:35:42.620 --> 02:35:52.860
about, saying, why is there a Nevada vagina action? And am I bad for laughing at this?

02:35:52.860 --> 02:35:57.500
And it's a little picture of the girl done in ASCII art that you could use in your signature

02:35:57.500 --> 02:36:03.060
on a forum if you wanted to. I could copy and paste that in IRC if I was feeling dumb,

02:36:03.060 --> 02:36:08.260
but I'm not going to. I think it's cute, I don't think there's any reason to laugh, or

02:36:38.260 --> 02:36:42.260
But, I don't know about the anime shirts. See, any ideas, Jamie?

02:36:44.260 --> 02:36:47.260
That's disgusting. Jamie, any ideas about the anime shirts?

02:36:47.260 --> 02:36:49.260
Oh, no. Go to San Francisco.

02:36:49.260 --> 02:36:51.260
Low-key?

02:36:53.260 --> 02:36:57.260
Um, you might try. Depends on what you're looking for. If you're looking for, um...

02:36:58.260 --> 02:37:00.260
I guess it would depend on what series you're looking for.

02:37:00.260 --> 02:37:06.260
Because a lot of the film companies like ADV and stuff, they put out t-shirts along with their DVDs and stuff.

02:37:06.260 --> 02:37:14.260
So a site where you'd buy them, you'd probably be able to get the t-shirts from. I've tried maybe writestuff.com, and I think that's stuff with one F.

02:37:14.260 --> 02:37:23.260
And, um, yeah, I think you might try there. And just do fucking Google search. Anime t-shirts. I'm sure you'll pull that shit up.

02:37:23.260 --> 02:37:25.260
Alright.

02:37:27.260 --> 02:37:33.260
You did not just say there's a bukkake picture. That is disgusting. Let me see it. I have to see it now.

02:37:33.260 --> 02:37:43.260
to see it now. Oh my God, I'm going to die. Okay, Misty has a question. Oh my God, that's

02:37:43.260 --> 02:37:57.260
disgusting! I'm done with this show, I'm so done. Alright. I hate to say it, but some

02:37:57.260 --> 02:38:01.860
of them are just pretty funny. Alright, now simmer down for a minute, let's listen to

02:38:31.860 --> 02:38:33.780
It doesn't matter if it's arcade or console.

02:38:33.780 --> 02:38:37.180
Hell, give both if you remember.

02:38:37.180 --> 02:38:38.980
Probably Castlevania.

02:38:38.980 --> 02:38:40.220
Castlevania was my first.

02:38:40.220 --> 02:38:44.540
Or Twinbeats, actually as it was on the NES, Stinger.

02:38:44.540 --> 02:38:45.740
Mm, Stinger.

02:38:45.740 --> 02:38:47.940
I vividly remember getting Castlevania

02:38:47.940 --> 02:38:50.380
for my birthday or something for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

02:38:50.380 --> 02:38:51.820
That was the first Konami game I had.

02:38:51.820 --> 02:38:52.660
You remember?

02:38:52.660 --> 02:38:55.160
I don't know if you remember this, but on the 8-bit Nintendo,

02:38:55.160 --> 02:38:58.420
the Konami games came in a unique sort of packaging,

02:38:58.420 --> 02:39:01.220
sort of like the old Activision cartridges and the Atari 2600.

02:39:01.220 --> 02:39:06.220
all look the same. So did the Konami. They were all gray. You remember that? Yeah. So

02:39:06.220 --> 02:39:10.500
I remember Castlevania was the first of those games that I owned. Angel. The only one I

02:39:10.500 --> 02:39:18.060
remember, I know this is completely lame because it's one of the later games, but Contra. Contra

02:39:18.060 --> 02:39:20.700
was probably the second. I used to play the hell out of Contra. Contra was probably the

02:39:20.700 --> 02:39:25.140
second. In fact, as far as arcade games go, I would probably say Contra versus would be

02:39:25.140 --> 02:39:28.700
the first. That I remember, really. I mean, there might have been, because Konami did

02:39:28.700 --> 02:39:32.500
a lot of games in the early 80s too and I just don't remember what they did. So that

02:39:32.500 --> 02:39:37.740
one I remember. You remember how on the Pay Choice 10 you could play the old school Nintendo

02:39:37.740 --> 02:39:43.620
games? Yeah. Yeah. I remember playing Contra on one of those ones. Loki, you remember?

02:39:43.620 --> 02:39:50.180
My first game was Life Force. It was one of the first three games I had on, or one of

02:39:50.180 --> 02:39:58.680
first few games I had on Nintendo, because I got, what was it, it was Breakthrough, Zelda,

02:39:58.680 --> 02:40:02.220
and I think Life Force were the first three games I had on Nintendo. Of course, we know

02:40:02.220 --> 02:40:09.380
Life Force also as a salamander. Yes I know, but this was Life Force, not salamander.

02:40:09.380 --> 02:40:15.220
It's just like how, what got me into DDR were the games Bust a Groove, and I know it's Bust

02:40:15.220 --> 02:40:19.140
a Move in Japan, but when I played it, it was Bust a Groove. I didn't even know there

02:40:19.140 --> 02:40:24.480
was an import scene until I got into this DDR stuff so I guess that's one way

02:40:24.480 --> 02:40:28.920
you could put it. And I know Jamie loves it when I call it Busta Groove. Busta

02:40:28.920 --> 02:40:33.840
Groove, Busta Groove, Busta Groove. I just got the finger. Alright, Blarg has a

02:40:33.840 --> 02:40:42.080
question. I'm not... Jesus. Leave it to Blarg. I'm not sure if this has been asked

02:40:42.080 --> 02:40:46.520
before but would any of you participate in some bukkake action if given the

02:40:46.520 --> 02:40:49.860
p.s. i'm not offering no

02:40:49.860 --> 02:40:53.920
how do you know we haven't already

02:40:53.920 --> 02:40:55.920
i don't think so

02:40:55.920 --> 02:40:59.560
unless it's like cake frosting bukkake or something

02:40:59.560 --> 02:41:01.240
cuz cake frosting is yummy

02:41:01.240 --> 02:41:02.840
as opposed to... yes?

02:41:02.840 --> 02:41:05.500
sushi

02:41:05.500 --> 02:41:06.780
what the hell

02:41:06.780 --> 02:41:09.800
you don't remember the sushi down there

02:41:09.800 --> 02:41:10.920
i remember

02:41:10.920 --> 02:41:13.120
down the street i remember

02:41:13.120 --> 02:41:19.520
that's disgusting. You're the one that mentioned it too. Our listeners have way too much free

02:41:19.520 --> 02:41:24.200
time on their hands. You need to go read a book or something. Take the other guy's advice.

02:41:24.200 --> 02:41:29.020
All right. John Fields has a question. If you had your choice of getting sucked inside

02:41:29.020 --> 02:41:35.420
your TV and ending up inside of a video game, non-bomani and non-porn, Loki, no bubble bath

02:41:35.420 --> 02:41:42.100
babes for you, what game would it be? What game would it be? If you had to get sucked

02:41:42.100 --> 02:41:47.120
your TV into a video game any thoughts this is a weird question this is such a

02:41:47.120 --> 02:41:55.840
nerd question angel I have to go first cuz I'm making you Jamie are you gonna

02:41:55.840 --> 02:41:59.600
participate tonight show I'm sorry this is funny if you got had to get sucked

02:41:59.600 --> 02:42:06.760
into any video game what would it be and it sucks into any video game non-bomani

02:42:06.760 --> 02:42:11.800
non porn the nerdiest this is one of the top three nerdiest questions I think

02:42:11.800 --> 02:42:24.320
we've ever gotten. I honestly couldn't say. Um. Probably. Plea peel. It's gonna be cool

02:42:24.320 --> 02:42:27.600
just to walk along through the forest and solve all your problems by having a friendly

02:42:27.600 --> 02:42:35.320
puzzle game. Angel. I was gonna say Mr. Driller just because that's the game I can't stop

02:42:35.320 --> 02:42:39.760
playing right now, but that just doesn't sound right. You'd be drilling all day long and

02:42:39.760 --> 02:42:42.360
and then you suffocate and fly away like a little angel.

02:42:42.360 --> 02:42:45.960
I'm good at suffocating if you've ever watched me play.

02:42:45.960 --> 02:42:48.960
Loki.

02:42:48.960 --> 02:42:52.380
Um...

02:42:52.380 --> 02:42:56.640
I would have to say...

02:42:56.640 --> 02:43:00.440
I just put me in rumble roses because...

02:43:00.440 --> 02:43:01.560
I can just...

02:43:01.560 --> 02:43:03.000
Non-porn!

02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:04.600
That's not porn!

02:43:04.600 --> 02:43:05.940
Fuck that shit!

02:43:05.940 --> 02:43:07.920
I ain't porn!

02:43:07.920 --> 02:43:14.920
You'd be perfect for Grand Theft Auto!

02:43:37.920 --> 02:43:54.400
I would have to say Burger Time, because hamburgers are yummy. No, I'm kidding. Dark Tetsuya

02:43:54.400 --> 02:43:58.480
said that in the chat room, so I had to say that. No, actually, I already had some answers

02:43:58.480 --> 02:44:04.240
thought of. Legend of Zelda, because that was just such a cute game. Or, I would have

02:44:04.240 --> 02:44:09.520
to say Pokemon, because it's very similar to Jamie, what if we could just settle our

02:44:09.520 --> 02:44:13.480
scores by having our pets do battle instead of us, you know, just have our pets...

02:44:13.480 --> 02:44:18.480
Dude, Jeremy would sit on whatever pet you had and win.

02:44:18.480 --> 02:44:19.480
Or...

02:44:19.480 --> 02:44:21.480
Jeremy's like Snorax or whatever it was called.

02:44:21.480 --> 02:44:25.480
Or Final Fantasy IV, because I just have so many good memories about that game.

02:44:25.480 --> 02:44:29.160
And I practically did live that game back when I was a kid.

02:44:29.160 --> 02:44:31.960
When I was a kid, I did live that game, okay, so what can I say?

02:44:31.960 --> 02:44:40.960
I just thought of another good one from the old school, Kid Icarus or Icarus or whatever the heck you want to pronounce it, you know.

02:44:40.960 --> 02:44:46.960
That was a good one. I like some of the answers the chat room is giving. Evil Naoki 2DX says, I'd be in Katamari Damacy.

02:44:46.960 --> 02:44:47.960
Oh!

02:44:47.960 --> 02:44:49.960
Leisure Suit Larry.

02:44:53.960 --> 02:44:57.960
Or BMX Triple X. Nah, BMX Triple X is too much work. Leisure Suit Larry.

02:44:57.960 --> 02:45:05.480
DarklionXVI says, what do you think of my Dancer video I linked you last week?

02:45:05.480 --> 02:45:11.720
Well, it was Dancer. I love Dancer. What can I say? Dancer is fabulous.

02:45:11.720 --> 02:45:14.780
I highly recommend Dancer. Go ahead and post the link in our chat.

02:45:14.780 --> 02:45:17.560
Let the chat people see it so that they can know what I'm talking about.

02:45:17.560 --> 02:45:21.960
Oh, Jesus. Okay, here's a question from Seager.

02:45:21.960 --> 02:45:24.480
Jamie, maybe you can answer this one. I don't know.

02:45:24.480 --> 02:45:25.480
Let's see.

02:45:25.480 --> 02:45:31.880
Uh, what's the best way to make two brothers have sex, and stay somewhat hidden with your video camera?

02:45:34.280 --> 02:45:36.280
Drugs, lots of drugs.

02:45:37.720 --> 02:45:38.780
Loki has a suggestion.

02:45:39.580 --> 02:45:41.180
Ecstasy and alcohol.

02:45:46.180 --> 02:45:51.480
Well, seriously, if you had them do enough ecstasy and alcohol, they would not be able to even see you there in the corner.

02:45:51.480 --> 02:45:52.580
You'd just be another fixture.

02:45:52.580 --> 02:45:55.820
you could like you could you know like in cartoons when they're trying to

02:45:55.820 --> 02:46:00.380
disguise themselves you'd probably be able to join in you know how you could

02:46:00.380 --> 02:46:05.060
disguise yourself as a palm tree or or as a lamp I'd like no no this was just

02:46:05.060 --> 02:46:08.420
on drawn together the couple weeks ago you can disguise yourself as a lamp by

02:46:08.420 --> 02:46:12.060
just putting a lamp shade on your head so you could do that and then have your

02:46:12.060 --> 02:46:16.620
video camera there so and you're just a lamp

02:46:16.620 --> 02:46:27.180
you guys are sick illusion has an orange lounge radio question

02:46:27.180 --> 02:46:32.400
if you drop a kitty in a blender and you shuffle cards at the same time what are you guys doing

02:46:32.400 --> 02:46:40.900
for new year's eve

02:46:40.900 --> 02:46:44.820
blink blink dot dot dot i think there's only one part of that question

02:46:44.820 --> 02:46:51.180
he needed to hear. Loki. Easy, that's what I'm doing for New Year's. Drop me a kitty

02:46:51.180 --> 02:47:02.540
in a blender and shuffling cards. It's kitty smoothie and poker. Jamie, do you have a serious

02:47:02.540 --> 02:47:08.220
answer for this poor question? I'm going to be heavily intoxicated. Yes, whatever I do

02:47:08.220 --> 02:47:15.140
there will be drinking involved and hopefully sex if I get my way. Just not with two brothers,

02:47:15.140 --> 02:47:20.620
because I'm not into that. Angel, you thinking over there? Do you have a plot, a plan?

02:47:20.620 --> 02:47:26.900
Not for the kiddie questions, like whatever, but I don't know.

02:47:26.900 --> 02:47:29.500
I think that was just a red herring. I don't think that was the actual question. I think

02:47:29.500 --> 02:47:33.500
the question was New Year's Eve. All right. I don't know. I don't know what

02:47:33.500 --> 02:47:37.900
I'm doing for New Year's or whatever. Maybe somebody will kidnap me so we can all have

02:47:37.900 --> 02:47:44.700
a good time because kidnappings are fun I know this is like way late but I

02:47:44.700 --> 02:47:51.100
remember two things I'm mad at and these are both movie related too I'm pissed

02:47:51.100 --> 02:47:58.220
off at closer because Nellie Portman did not get naked and I'm also pissed off at

02:47:58.220 --> 02:48:05.580
this other game or not this other show called a my life or yeah the life or

02:48:05.580 --> 02:48:09.660
or something like that, starring Denise Richards, and she didn't get naked in that either! It's

02:48:09.660 --> 02:48:16.940
a fucking underrated goddamn DVD! You're supposed to get naked! Naked! You're Playboy fucking

02:48:16.940 --> 02:48:21.540
get naked on the goddamn- It's a foreign film, even! Where nudity's not even a big deal,

02:48:21.540 --> 02:48:27.620
but no! Just show your tits in fucking Playboy! You're the worst fucking magazine out there.

02:48:27.620 --> 02:48:33.020
Next to Entertainment Weekly. Anyways.

02:48:33.020 --> 02:48:39.520
New Year's Eve? Uh, probably watch TV. What did we do last year? I watched an Iron Chef

02:48:39.520 --> 02:48:46.520
marathon and then we had sex. That sounds like the perfect way to spend New Year's Eve.

02:48:46.520 --> 02:48:52.380
I can't remember if it was New Year's or that was how I spent Halloween. It was one of those

02:48:52.380 --> 02:49:00.380
holidays we watched an Iron Chef marathon and had sex. That could have been both, actually.

02:49:00.380 --> 02:49:01.380
Wow.

02:49:01.380 --> 02:49:03.980
Alright, anyway, that's fine.

02:49:03.980 --> 02:49:07.820
I got invited to a party, so I'll probably go.

02:49:07.820 --> 02:49:10.940
That's what I'm doing for New Year's.

02:49:10.940 --> 02:49:15.780
Unless the chance to have sex comes up, then I will ditch everybody.

02:49:15.780 --> 02:49:16.780
And it has to be good sex.

02:49:16.780 --> 02:49:22.340
Eva Maoki 2DX says, speaking of internet crazes, ever heard of the OS girls?

02:49:22.340 --> 02:49:27.740
If y'all don't know, basically people in Japan created anime mascots for different operating

02:49:27.740 --> 02:49:32.480
systems but the real question what okay so have you guys ever heard of this they

02:49:32.480 --> 02:49:37.600
have and what do you think they did one that was posted on I have fuck I don't

02:49:37.600 --> 02:49:43.580
remember now I think it was on slash dot for Firefox and they did some furry for

02:49:43.580 --> 02:49:49.760
that some shit I didn't get to see the other ones because the link that they

02:49:49.760 --> 02:49:54.800
posted it to didn't I couldn't find them in person's gallery but it was

02:49:54.800 --> 02:49:59.560
interesting. I think I, I want to say I posted that in my live journal, but I can't remember

02:49:59.560 --> 02:50:00.560
if I did or not.

02:50:00.560 --> 02:50:02.000
Nope, I know who posted it in their live journal.

02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:07.280
But, um, someone posted it in their live journal, and I'm going to show Rob here in the studio.

02:50:07.280 --> 02:50:10.400
Well, actually, fuck, I'm going to have to, like, go through five pages of friend's stuff

02:50:10.400 --> 02:50:18.440
to find it. Remember who posted that? Okay. Anyways, Rob talk and I'll find it.

02:50:18.440 --> 02:50:22.580
Fine. The real question that, uh, even theAlky2DX wants to ask is, what do you all think of

02:50:22.580 --> 02:50:30.780
internet crazes. I think they're funny. I think they're funny until they get old. I

02:50:30.780 --> 02:50:34.500
mean, like, some things are getting old. Like, I'm sorry, because I know Jamie's a fan, but

02:50:34.500 --> 02:50:40.980
I think Strong Bad is kind of old now. Did I say I was a fan? Well, I just know you quote

02:50:40.980 --> 02:50:47.340
Strong Bad a lot. It's because I live with Dan, and Dan quotes Strong Bad a lot. I just

02:50:47.340 --> 02:50:51.340
I just think Homestar Runner is kind of like so last year.

02:50:51.340 --> 02:50:55.340
All right.

02:50:55.340 --> 02:50:59.340
Anything else? Internet crazes? Anybody else have a comment on internet crazes?

02:50:59.340 --> 02:51:03.340
No, because I can't think of any at the moment. How about the hamster dance?

02:51:03.340 --> 02:51:07.340
That was like three years ago. That was the dancing baby.

02:51:07.340 --> 02:51:11.340
Oh, okay, the dancing baby. Yeah, all right. Yeah, they're funny until they get old.

02:51:11.340 --> 02:51:15.340
This is a scary comment from Dark Knight in the chatroom.

02:51:15.340 --> 02:51:24.980
could see the chairman starting Loki's sex romp. You know from Iron Chef. Oh, I saw that

02:51:24.980 --> 02:51:29.040
picture. There's the Firefox anime girl. Can you like just post a link to chat room or

02:51:29.040 --> 02:51:37.740
something? Why not? Oh, you're not in chat. Oh, that sucks. Sucks to be you. Moving on

02:51:37.740 --> 02:51:41.980
with the questions Ask Orange Lounge. If you have a question, you can send it to us via

02:51:41.980 --> 02:51:46.320
private message in IRC or you can also give us a call on the skype line we're

02:51:46.320 --> 02:51:48.780
going to open up the skype line for you boys and girls that want to give us a

02:51:48.780 --> 02:51:54.780
call over there legend of Zaku says if I were to down this death brick called the

02:51:54.780 --> 02:51:58.500
Hardee's monster thick burger burger I don't know if you've heard about this

02:51:58.500 --> 02:52:04.300
other things are humongous I saw without nasty what only courses would I have to

02:52:04.300 --> 02:52:08.780
do in order to burn off the 1400 plus calories that I'm taking in as a result

02:52:08.780 --> 02:52:14.140
of this burger. All of them. Yeah, all of them, basically. I'll put it this way. Legend

02:52:14.140 --> 02:52:19.660
rode five times. You would have to lift weights vigorously for four solid hours to burn off

02:52:19.660 --> 02:52:26.100
that many calories. And I'm surprised, Loki, I'm looking at the site right now, I'm surprised,

02:52:26.100 --> 02:52:31.680
and it's making that lightning noise right here. It's Hardee's.com, and I want Loki to

02:52:31.680 --> 02:52:38.380
see this. It's the Monster Burger. Hardee's, of course, somewhat related to Carl's Jr.

02:52:38.380 --> 02:52:43.580
the monster thick burger. Look at that. That's just a fucking Bacon Ultimate Cheeseburger.

02:52:43.580 --> 02:52:49.660
That's all that is. It's more than a Bacon Ultimate Cheeseburger. They're pretty humongous.

02:52:49.660 --> 02:52:54.580
They're larger than the $6 burger. Yeah, that's like two of those $6 patties right there,

02:52:54.580 --> 02:53:03.260
and like, look at whatever that sauce is right there. Yikes. If you go to fucking Fuddruckers,

02:53:03.260 --> 02:53:12.080
you can get one pound patties there okay so that burger ain't shit okay but yeah

02:53:12.080 --> 02:53:17.960
that looks tasty. John Fields has a question hey what if the chat room forced

02:53:17.960 --> 02:53:20.900
Orange Lounge Radio and you can stop right there because the chat room can't

02:53:20.900 --> 02:53:24.980
force us to do nothing but we'll entertain the question what if the chat

02:53:24.980 --> 02:53:29.240
room forced Orange Lounge Radio to do to a kids show like those you see on Nick

02:53:29.240 --> 02:53:34.240
Nick Jr. because of tonight's cage match. What would it be like, what would it be like

02:53:34.240 --> 02:53:38.260
if the show were on Nick Jr.? We wouldn't be on Nick Jr.

02:53:38.260 --> 02:53:41.400
I would sell this show out to anybody that would take it and I know you guys would too

02:53:41.400 --> 02:53:45.840
and if Nick Jr. was there, I would have a live studio audience filled with children

02:53:45.840 --> 02:53:52.560
and I would make Dark Sakura lecture them on proper grammar all night.

02:53:52.560 --> 02:53:59.520
and then have remedial class for their parents on how to do their fucking jobs.

02:53:59.520 --> 02:54:07.320
Beautiful. Last question of the evening from Seagurd. Okay, a real question. Are there

02:54:07.320 --> 02:54:16.400
any solid plans for an E3 show this year? Well, I guess one of the big questions is

02:54:16.400 --> 02:54:22.040
if we even get to go to E3 in the first place, we know Dark Sakura gets to go. Loki and I

02:54:22.040 --> 02:54:25.800
are pretty sure we're going to get to go again where with cards look good if you

02:54:25.800 --> 02:54:28.920
went the year before you can go again so we're kind of hoping that can happen

02:54:28.920 --> 02:54:31.460
so the answer is if we can get

02:54:31.460 --> 02:54:35.000
everything we need which would include a laptop

02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:35.840
hit hit

02:54:35.840 --> 02:54:37.980
hit hit jimmy

02:54:37.980 --> 02:54:42.360
and we stay in a nice enough hotel this time where we're not in the motel six

02:54:42.360 --> 02:54:45.540
in the middle of hollywood and we instead stay at a motel that has free high speed

02:54:45.540 --> 02:54:47.260
internet access like a

02:54:47.260 --> 02:54:48.460
motel seven

02:54:48.460 --> 02:54:50.700
or at least a holiday in which i think has that

02:54:50.700 --> 02:54:54.540
If we could do that, then yes, we could do a show, not necessarily from E3, but from

02:54:54.540 --> 02:54:59.020
the hotel. But here's the other part of the question. Would we want to spend our time

02:54:59.020 --> 02:55:04.340
in LA doing this program? I don't know. So, maybe. I think if worse comes to worse, we'll

02:55:04.340 --> 02:55:08.540
do something, we'll do lots of tape segments from E3. We're trying to do more at E3 this

02:55:08.540 --> 02:55:12.260
year, assuming we have to find out if we can go first. But if we can go, we're hoping to

02:55:12.260 --> 02:55:19.180
get more interviews and some many more fun stuff at E3. But again, it's still December,

02:55:19.180 --> 02:55:26.180
It's a little early, so we'll see soon enough.

02:55:26.180 --> 02:55:30.980
Alright, that's gonna do it for tonight's Ask Orange Lounge segment.

02:55:30.980 --> 02:55:35.980
What do you say we do another break? A quick break, and come back and wrap it up.

02:55:35.980 --> 02:55:37.680
You guys okay with that?

02:55:37.680 --> 02:55:38.580
Looks for me.

02:55:38.580 --> 02:55:41.180
Alright, let's do a break, and in this break we're gonna hear...

02:55:41.180 --> 02:55:45.480
I wanna hear something new. I wanna hear an UltraMix 2 song. Let's do...

02:55:45.480 --> 02:55:48.280
I don't know, what song sounds good to you? Let's do the Delirium song,

02:55:48.280 --> 02:55:50.280
Since we're having a delirium night.

02:55:50.280 --> 02:55:52.280
How's that sound?

02:55:52.280 --> 02:55:53.280
Oh, it's for me.

02:55:53.280 --> 02:55:56.280
Alright, we will be right back after this to wrap it up.

02:55:56.280 --> 02:55:58.280
Stay with us.

02:55:58.280 --> 02:56:02.280
The best is yet to come because we all know the best part of the show is when it's over.

02:56:28.280 --> 02:56:33.280
She's tired of smiling at me

02:56:33.280 --> 02:56:37.280
I just decided to come back inside of me

02:56:37.280 --> 02:56:40.280
And I think we're on our way

02:56:40.280 --> 02:56:44.280
Cause tomorrow she does nothing inside

02:56:44.280 --> 02:56:48.280
No good to give, no meaning to leave

02:56:48.280 --> 02:56:51.280
I'm missing all of my nights

02:56:51.280 --> 02:56:56.280
Everything runs out

02:57:10.280 --> 02:57:15.280
After all these decades, do we say no?

02:57:45.280 --> 02:58:02.280
Hello? Hello, is this thing on? Testing. Testing one, two.

02:58:02.280 --> 02:58:06.280
I'm looking in the index, but I don't see anything for how to run a radio show.

02:58:06.280 --> 02:58:10.280
Hello? I don't understand this. Does this thing work?

02:58:10.280 --> 02:58:12.280
This thing reads like stereo instructions.

02:58:12.280 --> 02:58:13.280
Is this on?

02:58:13.280 --> 02:58:20.280
Orange Lounge Radio, broke down Get Opa Monte Radio.

02:58:43.280 --> 02:58:47.360
get to get out of the hotel that is. We'll see. Anyway, we're going to wrap it up, but

02:58:47.360 --> 02:58:52.360
we've got to get everybody's final thoughts. So we'll start with DDR Angel.

02:58:52.360 --> 02:59:01.360
Well, I thought I'd bring up the game, or I can bring it up growing up for Skirt. That

02:59:01.360 --> 02:59:06.120
game that I like and that I got to do this. My bad. I totally forgot about it. Bring it

02:59:06.120 --> 02:59:09.040
up real quick. Tell the folks about it. What's it all about?

02:59:09.040 --> 02:59:15.040
It's basically a side-scrolling RPG game called MapleStory.

02:59:15.040 --> 02:59:17.040
A side-scrolling RPG?

02:59:17.040 --> 02:59:18.040
Yeah.

02:59:18.040 --> 02:59:19.040
What kind of a game?

02:59:19.040 --> 02:59:23.040
It kind of reminded me of Mystical Ninja at first, but I don't know, it's pretty cool.

02:59:23.040 --> 02:59:25.040
I mean, you can pick up coins and stuff, it's pretty cute.

02:59:25.040 --> 02:59:28.040
It's one of those cutesy ones again, you know, like Ragnarok was.

02:59:28.040 --> 02:59:32.040
It was cutesy and it was cool, and it still is cool, but you know.

02:59:32.040 --> 02:59:34.040
I don't know. Anyway.

02:59:34.040 --> 02:59:37.040
What was it? Maple... I can't think of the website now.

02:59:37.040 --> 02:59:38.040
MapleStory?

02:59:38.040 --> 02:59:41.220
you don't know the game's maple story

02:59:41.220 --> 02:59:43.080
maple global diet

02:59:43.080 --> 02:59:47.560
matter dot com

02:59:47.560 --> 02:59:52.560
for those people don't check it out good maple global

02:59:52.560 --> 02:59:54.280
may be stuck on

02:59:54.280 --> 03:00:00.000
i think it's not com

03:00:00.000 --> 03:00:07.000
evil maliki in our chat room says uh... maple story dot com

03:00:11.400 --> 03:00:13.640
sounds interesting i might have to check this out

03:00:13.640 --> 03:00:17.640
seems like a few people in our chat have heard of this before so we'll see

03:00:17.640 --> 03:00:20.400
angel's gonna hook me up with that later so i can check it out

03:00:20.400 --> 03:00:22.240
loki your final thought

03:00:22.240 --> 03:00:25.520
oh i'm sorry angel is that your final thought pretty much

03:00:25.520 --> 03:00:27.300
bye mr driller cause it's fun

03:00:27.300 --> 03:00:28.820
loki your final thought

03:00:28.820 --> 03:00:31.420
It is maplestory.com

03:00:31.420 --> 03:00:33.220
My final thought is

03:00:33.220 --> 03:00:35.900
I'm probably going to play some more Final Fantasy tonight

03:00:35.900 --> 03:00:38.100
because

03:00:38.100 --> 03:00:44.380
I like that game and I've spent so much time on it and yeah, that's all.

03:00:44.380 --> 03:00:48.700
Jamie, my final thought is I'm probably going to do the same thing as soon as I take Angel home.

03:00:48.700 --> 03:00:53.620
Jamie, your final thought. Actually, I have to run errands, which kind of sucks. Jamie, your final thought?

03:00:53.620 --> 03:00:56.460
Um...

03:00:56.460 --> 03:00:59.820
Nevada!

03:00:59.820 --> 03:01:01.680
All right.

03:01:01.680 --> 03:01:05.220
Now you know you're not going to have a final word. So I have to give the final word.

03:01:05.220 --> 03:01:07.360
I have another one.

03:01:07.360 --> 03:01:11.980
And thank you very much for listening everybody. Have a great night and thank you for supporting Orange Lounge Radio.

03:01:11.980 --> 03:01:14.640
We'll see you back here next week. Have a happy holiday season.

03:01:14.640 --> 03:01:19.440
And tune in all this week for more live programming here on Orange Lounge Radio.

03:01:19.440 --> 03:01:22.480
Jamie, the final word of tonight's show.

03:01:22.480 --> 03:01:24.220
Creamy.

03:01:24.220 --> 03:01:29.780
That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

03:01:29.780 --> 03:01:34.060

And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.

03:02:12.860 --> 03:02:15.860
He busted in, nearly scared him half to death

03:02:15.860 --> 03:02:19.860
Had a rifle in his hands, and cheap whiskey on his breath

03:02:19.860 --> 03:02:23.860
From his beard to his boots, he was covered with ammo

03:02:23.860 --> 03:02:27.860
Like a big, fat, drunk, disgruntled, yuletide Rambo

03:02:27.860 --> 03:02:31.860
And he smiled as he stared, with a twinkle in his eye

03:02:31.860 --> 03:02:36.860
Merry Christmas to all, now you're all gonna die!

03:02:36.860 --> 03:02:40.860
The night Santa went crazy

03:02:40.860 --> 03:02:44.500
The night St. Nick went insane

03:02:44.500 --> 03:02:48.500
Realized he'd been getting a raw meal

03:02:48.500 --> 03:02:52.500
So he finally must've snapped in his brain

03:02:53.000 --> 03:02:55.000
Well the workshop is gone now

03:02:55.000 --> 03:02:57.000
He decided to bomb it

03:02:57.000 --> 03:02:59.000
Everywhere you'll find pieces

03:02:59.000 --> 03:03:01.000
Of cupid and comet

03:03:01.000 --> 03:03:03.000
And he tied up his helpers

03:03:03.000 --> 03:03:05.000
And he held the elves hostage

03:03:05.000 --> 03:03:07.000
And he ground up for Rudolph

03:03:07.000 --> 03:03:09.000
Into reindeer sausage

03:03:09.000 --> 03:03:13.000
He got Dancer and Brandler with an old German Luger

03:03:13.000 --> 03:03:17.000
And he slashed up Dasher just like Freddy Krueger

03:03:17.000 --> 03:03:19.000
And he picked up a flame thrower

03:03:19.000 --> 03:03:21.000
And he barbecued Blitzen

03:03:21.000 --> 03:03:25.000
And he took a big bite and laid his head just like chicken

03:03:25.000 --> 03:03:29.000
The night Santa went crazy

03:03:29.000 --> 03:03:33.000
The night kids crinkled with Santa

03:03:33.000 --> 03:03:37.000
You can't hardly walk around the North Pole

03:03:37.000 --> 03:03:40.760
Without stepping in reindeer's blood

03:03:40.760 --> 03:03:47.440
There's a National Guard and the FBI

03:03:47.440 --> 03:03:50.960
There's a van from the eye with a zoo

03:03:50.960 --> 03:03:55.320
And a helicopter circling round in the sky

03:03:55.320 --> 03:03:59.640
And the bullets are flying, the spotting is rising

03:03:59.640 --> 03:04:06.120
And everyone's dying to know who's better why

03:04:06.120 --> 03:04:09.120
My, my, my, my, my, my

03:04:09.120 --> 03:04:13.120
You used to be such a jolly guy

03:04:20.120 --> 03:04:24.120
Yes, Virginia, now Santa's doin' time

03:04:24.120 --> 03:04:28.120
In a federal prison, or is it summer's crime?

03:04:28.120 --> 03:04:32.120
Hey, little friend, now, don't you cry no more tears

03:04:32.120 --> 03:04:35.880
He'll be out with good behavior in seven hundred more years

03:04:35.880 --> 03:04:39.880
But now makes him in therapy and Donner's so nervous

03:04:39.880 --> 03:04:43.880
And the elbow got jobs working for the postal service

03:04:43.880 --> 03:04:47.880
And the famous is why she's on the phone every night

03:04:47.880 --> 03:04:52.380
When the lawyer negotiates the movie rights they talk about

03:04:52.380 --> 03:04:59.880
The night span away craving the night St. Nicholas lived

03:04:59.880 --> 03:05:03.880
Broke his back for some meltin' cookie

03:05:03.880 --> 03:05:07.880
Felt to me like he was tired of gettin' sick, whoa

03:05:07.880 --> 03:05:11.880
The night fennel went crazy

03:05:11.880 --> 03:05:15.880
The night paint jig went insane

03:05:15.880 --> 03:05:19.880
Realized he's been gettin' the wrong deal

03:05:19.880 --> 03:05:23.880
Some finally must've snapped in his brain, whoa

03:05:23.880 --> 03:05:27.880
Some finally must've snapped in his brain, tell ya

03:05:27.880 --> 03:05:34.880
who finally put the sand in his brain.

03:05:34.880 --> 03:05:53.260
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

03:06:04.880 --> 03:06:17.800
The Orange Lounge Radio After Birth. Here it is, the part after the credits.

03:06:17.800 --> 03:06:19.760
Any exciting plans for this week, Dark Sakura?

03:06:19.760 --> 03:06:24.040
Sitting on my ass, maybe playing some Phantasy Star online.

03:06:24.040 --> 03:06:28.640
Are you getting back into that? Yeah, I may as well. I'm still paying for

03:06:28.640 --> 03:06:31.480
it. You know, episode four is being beta tested

03:06:31.480 --> 03:06:32.840
right now. Oh, joy.

03:06:32.840 --> 03:06:37.480
and apparently the card thing is gone. Good, because the card thing was retarded.

03:06:37.480 --> 03:06:42.360
Oh my god. You know, this whole card craze thing...

03:06:42.360 --> 03:06:45.340
horrible.

03:06:45.340 --> 03:06:46.680
Yeah, I agree.

03:06:46.680 --> 03:06:48.540
I agree.

03:06:48.540 --> 03:06:50.060
The card thing was not good.

03:06:50.060 --> 03:06:55.280
But we talked about that a little bit on Outside the Box a couple weeks ago, so, interesting.

03:06:55.280 --> 03:07:02.280
uh... low-key any exciting plans for the week

03:07:03.740 --> 03:07:10.100
angel you got any exciting plans this week you are pretty boring

03:07:10.100 --> 03:07:16.860
man i really

03:07:16.860 --> 03:07:19.320
man what do you do for fun

03:07:19.320 --> 03:07:21.140
i don't know

03:07:21.140 --> 03:07:23.540
you what i don't know that

03:07:23.540 --> 03:07:24.740
i held a lot

03:07:24.740 --> 03:07:29.140
I hella want Boba, but I can't go out for Boba tonight because I have errands to run.

03:07:29.140 --> 03:07:32.500
I have to get up at 6.30, I'm sorry, 5.30 in the morning.

03:07:32.500 --> 03:07:36.920
Boba sounds like a good time though, it really does.

03:07:36.920 --> 03:07:42.220
Darn you for bringing it up!

03:07:42.220 --> 03:07:43.940
Oh well, what can you do?

03:07:43.940 --> 03:07:49.540
Alright, well I guess that's it, unless anybody else has anything exciting they want to add.

03:07:49.540 --> 03:07:51.540
No? Alrighty then.

03:07:51.540 --> 03:07:55.000
We're going to go back to our Bahmani Music and More program.

03:07:55.000 --> 03:07:58.800
Commercial free tonight, boys and girls, for a little while after the show.

03:07:58.800 --> 03:08:05.020
We're going to start it off, though, with something special, for those of you guys that stuck around, because I know a lot of you guys ditch us before the...

03:08:05.020 --> 03:08:10.320
No, I want to play something kind of new, because it's new and desirable by people,

03:08:10.320 --> 03:08:12.420
because you don't get to hear it a whole lot.

03:08:12.420 --> 03:08:15.520
So we're actually going to play

03:08:15.520 --> 03:08:17.240
that new remix,

03:08:17.240 --> 03:08:19.600
which we haven't really played a whole lot here on the station.

03:08:19.600 --> 03:08:21.800
So, some of you guys may actually not have heard it yet.

03:08:21.800 --> 03:08:23.960
You know the junk circuit mix of I Feel?

03:08:23.960 --> 03:08:25.380
You remember that one?

03:08:25.380 --> 03:08:27.040
We're gonna play that for you guys

03:08:27.040 --> 03:08:28.240
who stuck around for us.

03:08:28.240 --> 03:08:29.520
And have a great night, everybody.

03:08:29.520 --> 03:08:31.360
Thanks for tuning in and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.

03:08:31.360 --> 03:08:32.200
Have a good one.

03:08:34.280 --> 03:08:35.480
Do you feel it?

03:08:35.480 --> 03:08:42.480
I think I'm getting sick of this shit.

03:08:42.480 --> 03:08:45.480
I don't feel good.

03:08:45.480 --> 03:08:48.480
I feel good.

03:08:48.480 --> 03:08:52.480
I don't feel good.

03:08:52.480 --> 03:08:55.480
I don't feel good.

03:08:55.480 --> 03:08:58.480
I don't feel good.

03:08:58.480 --> 03:09:02.480
I feel good.

03:09:02.480 --> 03:09:04.480
Thanks for watching!
