07:47.284 --> 07:51.787
[SPEAKER_14]: But as for those of you guys abroad and the rest of the nation and the world, things are boring for you.

07:51.807 --> 07:52.248
[SPEAKER_14]: What can I say?

07:52.268 --> 07:52.748
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I'm kidding.

07:54.129 --> 07:54.990

[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, we'll be back after this break of music featuring, you know, I'm thinking people seem to dig the Eurobeat pre-show we had going there, so I think we'll just keep the Eurobeat thing going.

08:29.563 --> 08:30.544
[SPEAKER_14]: How's that sound for you guys?

08:31.304 --> 08:32.085
[SPEAKER_14]: Works for me.

08:32.285 --> 08:33.065
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, works for me.

08:33.866 --> 08:37.048
[SPEAKER_14]: We're gonna kick it off with a song that was in two different Bomani games.

08:38.049 --> 08:39.129
[SPEAKER_14]: See if you can tell which ones.

08:39.590 --> 08:42.672
[SPEAKER_14]: Right after... Actually, a lot of these songs showed up in multiple games.

08:43.612 --> 08:44.553
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll be right back after this.

10:25.106 --> 10:26.468
Thanks for watching!

12:19.813 --> 12:20.756

13:47.796 --> 13:49.017
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you guys for tuning in tonight.

13:49.037 --> 13:51.498
[SPEAKER_14]: We do appreciate your support, as always.

13:52.298 --> 13:54.299
[SPEAKER_14]: Some Eurobeat music in that break, just for you guys.

13:54.499 --> 13:56.279
[SPEAKER_14]: Because you guys seem to dig that during the pre-show.

13:56.319 --> 14:00.861
[SPEAKER_14]: At least those of you guys that spoke up in our chatroom, www.orangeloungeradio.com.

14:01.261 --> 14:07.803
[SPEAKER_14]: And if you didn't like that, well, you need to go back into chat and let us know so that the rest of the chatroom can yell at you appropriately.

14:07.823 --> 14:09.624
[SPEAKER_14]: Because that's what they'll do.

14:10.384 --> 14:12.325
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to be the first to say I didn't like that.

14:13.959 --> 14:16.560
[SPEAKER_14]: If you thought that break was bad, wait till you see the next break.

14:16.580 --> 14:18.220
[SPEAKER_14]: I already have the music queued up for the next break.

14:18.640 --> 14:21.681
[SPEAKER_14]: Tonight, the goal is to drive you all crazy.

14:22.142 --> 14:26.543
[SPEAKER_14]: Because, you know, it is the holiday time, and this is the time of year when everybody goes, we'll be crazy.

14:27.323 --> 14:30.384
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, just thought we'd get some appropriate music to match that.

14:30.444 --> 14:31.004
[SPEAKER_14]: So, we'll see.

14:31.665 --> 14:33.305
[SPEAKER_14]: And at some point tonight, Silent Hill.

14:33.505 --> 14:34.025
[SPEAKER_14]: I promise.

14:34.325 --> 14:37.847
[SPEAKER_14]: Because it is the season.

14:37.967 --> 14:38.487
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what we'll do?

14:38.527 --> 14:39.787
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll do like a Silent Hill break.

14:39.807 --> 14:42.308
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll play both remixes of Silent Hill, and then like your reign.

14:44.758 --> 14:51.804
[SPEAKER_13]: You gotta play both versions of Silent Hill than that one song by Roman Holloway that was in Dancing the Stage.

14:52.405 --> 14:53.246
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a Christmas song too.

14:53.766 --> 14:54.427
[SPEAKER_13]: If I can find it.

14:54.507 --> 14:56.929
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to hear You're Not Here.

14:57.750 --> 15:00.252
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I put that song on repeat four times in my car on the way here.

15:00.492 --> 15:02.514
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll definitely do You're Not Here a little later.

15:03.034 --> 15:05.677
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember when Parapara, or Parapara, however you like to say it.

15:05.717 --> 15:06.157
[SPEAKER_14]: Parapara.

15:06.177 --> 15:06.758
[SPEAKER_14]: Parapara.

15:06.838 --> 15:07.498
[SPEAKER_14]: Parapara.

15:07.919 --> 15:09.060
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember when that used to be cool?

15:10.887 --> 15:14.091
[SPEAKER_14]: It seems like this subject comes up at least once a month on this show.

15:14.732 --> 15:16.976
[SPEAKER_14]: When Parabara was cool.

15:17.476 --> 15:21.943
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember when we all met at Miggle when they first got it and I only knew how to do half of the patapata.

15:21.963 --> 15:24.627
[SPEAKER_02]: So I tried.

15:25.552 --> 15:28.834
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember tutorial mode in second mix, and I taught myself how to do it.

15:28.854 --> 15:31.475
[SPEAKER_14]: And I tried to learn the Mickey Mouse March, which we heard in that break there.

15:31.495 --> 15:32.936
[SPEAKER_18]: The Mickey Mouse March is freaking hard.

15:32.956 --> 15:34.317
[SPEAKER_14]: Freaking hard, oh my god.

15:34.377 --> 15:36.318
[SPEAKER_14]: And the DeltaDance.com is hard.

15:36.938 --> 15:38.459
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I'm, no, I never learned that one.

15:38.479 --> 15:40.460
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you were watching when I tried to learn that one.

15:40.520 --> 15:40.780
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

15:40.920 --> 15:41.801
[SPEAKER_02]: In Stockton.

15:42.081 --> 15:50.185
[SPEAKER_14]: I, now, Loki sits here and bashes on Parapara, but I remember when he used to break out his white boy freestyle to some Parapara songs.

15:51.857 --> 15:54.618
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that was back in the day when I was doing knee drops on DDR.

15:54.658 --> 15:56.838
[SPEAKER_13]: I've come a long way since then.

15:56.998 --> 15:59.479
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember how happy I was when I learned how to do Deluxe.

16:00.899 --> 16:02.279
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd get to go out there and shake my ass.

16:02.659 --> 16:06.500
[SPEAKER_14]: I love doing Deluxe, but I... No, you were funny doing Like a Virgin.

16:07.440 --> 16:10.521
[SPEAKER_14]: Like a Virgin was like the second par par I ever learned.

16:10.581 --> 16:13.962
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember living at the Bomani house.

16:14.062 --> 16:15.762
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone learned Boom Boom Fire first.

16:16.022 --> 16:17.762
[SPEAKER_14]: You remember the Bomani house years ago, right?

16:18.062 --> 16:19.723
[SPEAKER_14]: I should say Bomani Drama House.

16:20.143 --> 16:20.423
Bomani.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.361
[SPEAKER_02]: To say the least.

16:24.441 --> 16:26.262
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, different times.

16:26.342 --> 16:27.063
[SPEAKER_14]: What can you say?

16:27.103 --> 16:33.526
[SPEAKER_14]: But I remember when the house got para para, and that was like the first one I made myself sit down and learn.

16:33.566 --> 16:37.468
[SPEAKER_14]: I had already learned Boom Boom Fire, but I was like, it's got a Madonna connection.

16:38.108 --> 16:39.649
[SPEAKER_14]: As a gay man, I have to learn this dance.

16:40.669 --> 16:41.650
[SPEAKER_14]: And it wasn't really.

16:42.110 --> 16:43.691
[SPEAKER_14]: It's actually kind of challenging.

16:43.751 --> 16:45.572
[SPEAKER_14]: I still barely remember it to this day.

16:45.932 --> 16:46.172
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I...

16:48.743 --> 16:53.865
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that my first one that I learned was actually Eurobeat, which is like really easy.

16:54.586 --> 17:00.489
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I learned, I tried to learn Speedway, but Boom and Fire was like my third one.

17:01.289 --> 17:08.492
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when we had the five song chorus, I learned how to do, Night of Fire was my second one, that was it.

17:08.552 --> 17:09.793
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember Sexy, Sexy, Sexy?

17:10.493 --> 17:10.734
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

17:10.754 --> 17:11.154
[SPEAKER_14]: That was awesome.

17:11.634 --> 17:17.997
[SPEAKER_02]: But I wanted to learn, when we were still playing, I wanted to learn O Sole Mio, and I never did, just because the little walk where you stay on your ass.

17:20.029 --> 17:21.050
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm talking about!

17:21.390 --> 17:23.891
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh sole mio, I just farted!

17:25.352 --> 17:32.277
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you do your hand to one side, and then you do your other hand back, like the I'm the Little Teacup dance, except you're fanning your ass as you move forward.

17:33.638 --> 17:37.480
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, my ass is on fire, put me out!

17:39.761 --> 17:42.583
[SPEAKER_14]: Most people who play Parapar probably have an ass on fire.

17:44.424 --> 17:45.345
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a good one.

17:45.365 --> 17:46.786
[SPEAKER_14]: You're welcome, any time.

17:47.412 --> 17:50.095
[SPEAKER_14]: It's little observations like that that make this show worth it, you know?

17:50.275 --> 17:51.836
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you're so not PC.

17:51.876 --> 17:55.960
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember, that was really the first time we ever hung out, I think, that I met you, was that trip.

17:56.000 --> 18:12.356
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and then we went on to Ziggle, and Enrique was with us, and we both got our crappy Freestyle on 4th mix, and somehow or another, we ended up doing a complete mirror of each other.

18:13.746 --> 18:18.208
[SPEAKER_02]: and decided we were going to be all rad and did knee drops on the last thing, but it was like the two knee one.

18:18.828 --> 18:23.230
[SPEAKER_02]: It was to, uh, shoot, what was the song that everybody hated from Third Mix?

18:23.691 --> 18:25.491
[SPEAKER_14]: Was that the guy that always did the Buell dance?

18:25.651 --> 18:26.892
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I always did Buell.

18:27.032 --> 18:27.372
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

18:27.932 --> 18:30.354
[SPEAKER_14]: The, the, uh, boy band song?

18:30.374 --> 18:30.494
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

18:30.514 --> 18:35.716
[SPEAKER_02]: We always do the boy band style dancing, but we ended it, like, back to back at the same time.

18:35.756 --> 18:36.276
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty cool.

18:36.436 --> 18:37.417
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, oh my god.

18:38.217 --> 18:39.278
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever happened to that guy?

18:39.858 --> 18:40.758
[SPEAKER_02]: I went into him.

18:41.319 --> 18:41.619
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

18:41.999 --> 18:43.960
[SPEAKER_02]: Like six months ago or something.

18:44.380 --> 18:45.721
[SPEAKER_02]: But he's like, hi, hi, okay, bye.

18:45.801 --> 18:49.363
[SPEAKER_14]: I love talking about people that our national listenership has no idea who they are.

18:49.423 --> 18:52.445
[SPEAKER_13]: But you know, who did that thing?

18:52.885 --> 18:53.505
[SPEAKER_13]: He was cool.

18:54.486 --> 18:57.567
[SPEAKER_14]: You remember that guy at that one place here locally that did that thing?

18:57.627 --> 18:58.268
[SPEAKER_14]: He was awesome.

18:59.068 --> 19:01.389
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, we're getting a little off track.

19:01.429 --> 19:04.371
[SPEAKER_14]: We have to start off the show as we start off every night's programs.

[SPEAKER_14]: I'm poor, so I haven't bought gifts yet, so forgive me.

[SPEAKER_02]: And she's got like religious symbols on her that want to kill people.

19:52.352 --> 19:53.333
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we put her on the cam?

19:53.433 --> 19:55.114
[SPEAKER_14]: I can use it to open a portal to hell.

19:55.334 --> 19:55.895
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, hello.

19:55.935 --> 19:57.256
[SPEAKER_14]: You're off the Richter scale.

19:57.296 --> 19:59.197
[SPEAKER_14]: For once, Jamie is too loud tonight.

19:59.218 --> 20:00.238
[SPEAKER_02]: And she has an apple.

20:01.079 --> 20:02.900
[SPEAKER_14]: Jamie's doing the Jonas thing there a little bit.

20:02.920 --> 20:03.721

[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

20:03.921 --> 20:04.782
[SPEAKER_02]: She's cute.

20:04.982 --> 20:06.123
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to be on the cam though.

20:06.803 --> 20:09.005
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, we'll get the doll on the cam, the evil doll.

20:09.506 --> 20:11.307
[SPEAKER_14]: And can you get my present up there too?

20:12.188 --> 20:13.649
[SPEAKER_14]: For those folks looking at the cam.

20:14.329 --> 20:15.310
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not going to tell you what it is.

20:15.330 --> 20:16.251
[SPEAKER_14]: You have to go look at the cam.

20:17.468 --> 20:18.109
[SPEAKER_14]: It's right, it's right.

20:18.730 --> 20:20.552
[SPEAKER_14]: Angel, what's that DVD on the table there?

20:20.712 --> 20:21.613
[SPEAKER_14]: Oop, I already gave it him.

20:22.113 --> 20:22.594
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, there you go.

[SPEAKER_14]: You can go put that on the cam as well.

20:26.618 --> 20:30.202
[SPEAKER_02]: I have cute Dolly, and she's evil.

20:30.943 --> 20:31.503
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, anyway.

20:32.524 --> 20:33.946
[SPEAKER_14]: So, DarkSakura, moving on.

20:33.966 --> 20:34.767
[SPEAKER_14]: How was your week, how was your day?

20:36.004 --> 20:40.706
[SPEAKER_02]: My week was cool, except I've been poor all week because I get paid like Wednesday.

20:41.926 --> 20:47.367
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have to wait until after payday to buy presents for people.

20:47.587 --> 20:48.788
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just a procrastinator.

20:48.828 --> 20:50.568
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not going to be buying any presents until Christmas Eve.

20:51.068 --> 20:54.249
[SPEAKER_02]: My whole week was nothing but school and working my ass off at the gym.

20:54.329 --> 20:55.650
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I love my doll so much.

20:56.710 --> 20:58.190
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, these are so cool.

20:58.571 --> 21:00.231
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have apples with needles in them.

21:02.112 --> 21:03.452
[SPEAKER_14]: The perfect Halloween treat.

21:05.461 --> 21:06.161
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god!

21:06.862 --> 21:07.742
[SPEAKER_02]: I love this outfit.

21:07.802 --> 21:08.563
[SPEAKER_02]: I would wear this.

21:09.223 --> 21:09.783
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.

21:10.024 --> 21:11.044
[SPEAKER_14]: This is great radio.

21:11.865 --> 21:12.145
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

21:12.725 --> 21:15.487
[SPEAKER_02]: Um... But, um... I, uh...

21:16.829 --> 21:30.672
[SPEAKER_02]: I really, all I did was go to the gym, and yesterday though, yesterday I hung out with, well I hung out with Anita twice at the gym, DD Alcoholic, and then I did a lot of spin, a lot of working out, I was really sore for a while.

21:31.053 --> 21:36.014
[SPEAKER_02]: Yesterday I hung out with Iguana Girl, and Islander, and Tia.

21:37.814 --> 21:39.575
[SPEAKER_14]: Who doesn't have an online name, she's just Tia.

21:39.595 --> 21:40.295
[SPEAKER_02]: She's just Tia.

21:40.875 --> 21:41.696
[SPEAKER_02]: Be great and terrible.

21:42.276 --> 21:42.896
[SPEAKER_02]: But awesome.

21:43.656 --> 21:44.016
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.

21:44.917 --> 21:48.658
[SPEAKER_02]: And we played Mario Party 6, which is pretty groovy.

21:49.238 --> 21:49.618
[SPEAKER_02]: I won.

21:49.938 --> 21:50.899
[SPEAKER_02]: I won so cool.

21:51.059 --> 21:52.399
[SPEAKER_14]: I always win Mario Party.

21:52.419 --> 21:53.880
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I've been beaten one time.

21:54.580 --> 21:59.062
[SPEAKER_14]: The reign of Princess Peach Terror comes into play.

21:59.082 --> 21:59.662
[SPEAKER_02]: I was Boo.

22:00.662 --> 22:01.963
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what we got?

22:02.563 --> 22:05.604
[SPEAKER_02]: Me and Tia won a game, one of the little mini games, and we got Daisy Boo.

22:07.285 --> 22:09.407
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, Princess Peach is still a playable character, right?

22:09.528 --> 22:12.011
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank God, because I always play Princess Peach.

22:12.091 --> 22:13.533
[SPEAKER_14]: I throw a fit if I can't be Peach.

22:14.294 --> 22:15.595
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to be the pretty princess.

22:18.179 --> 22:22.144
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I love when she does that Peach is the winner thing.

22:22.344 --> 22:23.065
[SPEAKER_14]: She flips her hair.

22:24.761 --> 22:28.463
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to move the chat room over the webcam again.

22:28.483 --> 22:36.588
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, we were trying to decide what to eat, so we kept talking about fish tacos.

22:39.009 --> 22:44.192
[SPEAKER_02]: And we couldn't get off of the subject about eating fish tacos.

22:45.353 --> 22:50.456
[SPEAKER_14]: How exactly do a bunch of women and Islander hanging out together prepare fish tacos?

22:52.364 --> 22:53.225
[SPEAKER_02]: It just came up.

22:56.168 --> 22:59.812
[SPEAKER_02]: A bunch of women hanging out preparing fish tacos.

23:00.913 --> 23:01.233
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

23:03.515 --> 23:07.479
[SPEAKER_02]: It made me think about that time we went to the Elephant Bar and I ordered fish tacos and you laughed about it.

23:08.340 --> 23:08.620
[SPEAKER_14]: I did.

23:08.680 --> 23:09.982
[SPEAKER_14]: I giggled for like a half hour straight.

23:10.262 --> 23:11.143
[SPEAKER_14]: I am so immature.

23:11.423 --> 23:11.924
[SPEAKER_14]: But you know what?

23:12.084 --> 23:15.047
[SPEAKER_14]: I know our listeners are immature too because I'm looking at the chat room right now.

23:16.521 --> 23:18.942
[SPEAKER_14]: Everybody is making ass jokes.

23:19.682 --> 23:22.424
[SPEAKER_14]: Just they're saying DDR songs and they're putting ass in the title.

23:22.444 --> 23:23.485
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll tell the ass?

23:23.605 --> 23:34.572
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, Love is Ass, Paranoia Survivor Ass, I like this, Cartoon Asses, Tittle Assle, Blow My Ass Bitch.

23:35.212 --> 23:36.253
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a good one.

23:36.273 --> 23:37.273
[SPEAKER_14]: This is funny apparently.

23:37.293 --> 23:38.154
[SPEAKER_02]: How about Burning Ass?

23:40.375 --> 23:40.675
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway.

23:41.596 --> 23:42.016
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

23:42.096 --> 23:42.897
[SPEAKER_14]: Scorching Ass.

23:44.344 --> 23:47.106
[SPEAKER_02]: I was referring to Burning Heat, but Burning Heat can also refer to ass, too.

23:47.126 --> 23:47.446
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you mean?

23:47.466 --> 23:47.986
[SPEAKER_02]: Scorching Moon?

23:48.246 --> 23:49.747
[SPEAKER_02]: If one doesn't bathe or something.

23:50.228 --> 23:50.488
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway.

23:51.028 --> 23:51.989
[SPEAKER_14]: Flash in the ass.

23:54.090 --> 23:55.271
[SPEAKER_02]: My week, my day.

23:55.291 --> 23:55.471
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

23:55.491 --> 23:56.211
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, sorry.

23:56.351 --> 23:57.392
[SPEAKER_02]: I have things to do.

23:57.412 --> 23:58.512
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, I was just preoccupied.

23:58.552 --> 23:59.353
[SPEAKER_14]: Drifting asses.

23:59.573 --> 23:59.773
[SPEAKER_14]: Ass.

24:00.313 --> 24:00.614
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob.

24:00.974 --> 24:01.174
[SPEAKER_14]: What?

24:02.074 --> 24:03.395
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you like to ass?

24:03.575 --> 24:05.597
Ass.

24:07.539 --> 24:08.980
[SPEAKER_14]: There's something in the air tonight.

24:09.361 --> 24:11.902
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a little too much eggnog going around for everybody.

24:11.962 --> 24:12.142
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, ass.

24:12.323 --> 24:12.803
[SPEAKER_14]: I think.

24:14.124 --> 24:14.444
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway.

24:14.784 --> 24:15.765
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I had alcohol.

24:15.845 --> 24:16.525
[SPEAKER_02]: Even a little bit.

24:16.586 --> 24:20.568
[SPEAKER_02]: Even when you cook all the alcohol out, I still react to it like giggly.

24:20.889 --> 24:23.891
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to... I cooked tonight, too.

24:24.171 --> 24:24.511
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

24:24.531 --> 24:25.212
[SPEAKER_02]: Back to last night.

24:26.632 --> 24:27.293
[SPEAKER_02]: Preparation.

24:29.261 --> 24:30.422
[SPEAKER_14]: Stop reading the chat room.

24:30.442 --> 24:31.702
[SPEAKER_14]: They're too immature tonight.

24:31.762 --> 24:33.443
[SPEAKER_14]: They don't deserve to be looked at.

24:33.843 --> 24:39.646
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we just could not decide on what to eat, so finally Ross is all, we're just going to go to a hometown buffet.

24:40.406 --> 24:40.626
Ew!

24:42.207 --> 24:42.427
[SPEAKER_06]: Ew!

24:42.907 --> 24:49.030
[SPEAKER_02]: So we went to like the... I've been to a couple of different hometown buffets and they were all kind of okay, you know.

24:49.430 --> 24:51.671
[SPEAKER_02]: We went to the one on the ass end of White Avenue.

24:53.172 --> 24:54.812
[SPEAKER_02]: And I literally do mean the ass end.

24:54.872 --> 24:56.273
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like up there by Walmart.

24:57.199 --> 25:07.948
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, to anybody who's not in this area, has no idea what you're talking about It's like the ghetto side of it If anyone has ever been in Sacramento, if you're going up past where McClellan was

25:08.826 --> 25:09.666
[SPEAKER_02]: It's up in the ass.

25:09.706 --> 25:12.027
[SPEAKER_14]: So basically you went to a hometown buffet in the ghetto.

25:12.287 --> 25:12.547
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

25:12.767 --> 25:13.147
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

25:13.947 --> 25:17.688
[SPEAKER_02]: And there were the people there saying, after this we're going to go get some entertainment over at Walmart.

25:18.748 --> 25:19.248
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, whatever.

25:20.648 --> 25:22.529
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, I ate a bunch of food.

25:22.849 --> 25:23.349
[SPEAKER_02]: It was yummy.

25:24.809 --> 25:26.050
[SPEAKER_02]: Of the temple of butt.

25:26.390 --> 25:27.070
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no, I'm sorry.

25:27.090 --> 25:27.950
[SPEAKER_14]: Stop reading chat.

25:28.170 --> 25:28.510
[SPEAKER_14]: Stop.

25:28.690 --> 25:29.250
[SPEAKER_14]: I command you.

25:30.010 --> 25:30.591
[SPEAKER_02]: Bite me.

25:30.611 --> 25:32.191
[SPEAKER_02]: Mmm, potato.

25:33.530 --> 25:34.151
[SPEAKER_02]: Get on Ass Cloud Style

25:56.496 --> 26:00.038
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, weekday, hometown buffet.

26:00.058 --> 26:07.702
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so we came back, watched Rejected, and Hedvig, I am a banana.

26:07.722 --> 26:12.204
[SPEAKER_14]: What?

26:12.684 --> 26:18.147
[SPEAKER_14]: My Rejected DVD was part of the settlement in my last relationship.

26:18.367 --> 26:18.447
Oh.

26:19.275 --> 26:26.117
[SPEAKER_14]: I made out with a third style, fourth style, and a DDR pad, and he made out with a rejected DVD, so it was a fair trade.

26:27.617 --> 26:31.538
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we watched Rejected, and then we watched Hedwig and the Angry Inch.

26:32.538 --> 26:33.158
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that movie.

26:33.738 --> 26:34.559
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I went home.

26:35.119 --> 26:37.099
[SPEAKER_02]: And then today, I sat on my ass and did nothing.

26:38.280 --> 26:42.341
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, okay, I went to the grocery store to buy cream, and Dan's like, buy me some ice cream.

26:43.421 --> 26:43.881
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

26:45.387 --> 26:49.929
[SPEAKER_02]: She sat around watching Return of the King, which I don't want to watch because I think Gollum is retarded.

26:50.930 --> 26:52.891
[SPEAKER_14]: There is something weird about that guy.

26:53.291 --> 26:56.973
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, of course he's meant to be creepy, but he actually turns my stomach.

26:57.853 --> 27:01.395
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I did manage to peek down for some of the Legolas scenes, so that was cool.

27:01.415 --> 27:02.696
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, ooh, elf man.

27:03.856 --> 27:10.199
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I came up here early before the show, about the time pre-show started, and I cooked.

27:11.280 --> 27:11.800
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, you did.

27:12.381 --> 27:18.029
[SPEAKER_02]: I made these kebabs with shrimp and scallops topped with lobster tail.

27:25.023 --> 27:29.604
[SPEAKER_02]: Green beans cooked in butter and herbs with cream sauce to coat.

27:29.644 --> 27:34.486
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm actually putting the recipe for the cream sauce in my live journal for anyone who goes to live journal.

27:34.526 --> 27:35.506
[SPEAKER_02]: Only my friends can see it.

27:36.046 --> 27:36.926
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're the lucky few.

27:36.946 --> 27:39.987
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, you could always put it in the Orange Lounge community because the Orange Lounge community needs something.

27:40.007 --> 27:40.807
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like them.

27:41.207 --> 27:41.708
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

27:41.868 --> 27:42.248
[SPEAKER_02]: Kidding.

27:44.349 --> 27:45.929
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll let someone else repost it for me.

27:46.510 --> 27:52.993
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically I made this amaretto cream sauce to go over it.

27:53.113 --> 28:04.139
[SPEAKER_02]: Normally when I make green beans I go for the Italian style spicy or I'll do it up Cajun style.

28:04.239 --> 28:05.760
[SPEAKER_02]: I went for sweet cream this time.

28:06.480 --> 28:07.521
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had garlic in it.

28:07.987 --> 28:09.950
[SPEAKER_14]: Jamie let me eat her sweet cream.

28:10.390 --> 28:11.091
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was good.

28:12.013 --> 28:18.261
[SPEAKER_02]: But I had garlic in it and some pepper and amaretto and butter and cream.

28:19.743 --> 28:21.686
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a lot of ingredients in Jamie's sweet cream.

28:22.410 --> 28:23.170
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, whatever.

28:24.631 --> 28:29.493
[SPEAKER_02]: But I am like, I just pulled this recipe right out of my ass and it tended to be really good.

28:29.973 --> 28:30.853
[SPEAKER_14]: I keep saying ass.

28:30.893 --> 28:33.314
[SPEAKER_14]: What is with the ass fixation with you people tonight?

28:33.494 --> 28:34.934
[SPEAKER_02]: Is everybody gay?

28:35.234 --> 28:37.255
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my normal phrasing, okay?

28:37.675 --> 28:39.476
[SPEAKER_02]: And the chat room is imitating me.

28:39.936 --> 28:41.077
[SPEAKER_02]: Pay me some rent, bitches.

28:42.457 --> 28:43.197
[SPEAKER_02]: I love you guys.

28:43.897 --> 28:44.178
[SPEAKER_02]: A little.

28:46.778 --> 28:47.079
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm done.

28:47.499 --> 28:47.919
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, you're done?

28:48.550 --> 28:49.551
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm done.

28:49.811 --> 28:51.112
[SPEAKER_14]: Wait, but whatever happened?

28:51.232 --> 28:52.954
[SPEAKER_14]: There were no fun stories about Hometown Buffet?

28:52.994 --> 28:53.835
[SPEAKER_14]: You kind of glossed right over it.

28:53.855 --> 28:54.976
[SPEAKER_02]: None of the people scared me there.

28:55.016 --> 28:58.679
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy in painter overalls with the beer belly.

28:59.139 --> 29:01.101
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I heard that there were... He's pregnant.

29:01.261 --> 29:06.546
[SPEAKER_14]: I heard that there are people out there that will go to Hometown Buffet in the morning and then stay there all day long.

29:07.062 --> 29:11.965
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they have a policy where they kick them out because they have to change the dinners and everything in between.

29:12.005 --> 29:13.226
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that's the smart thing to do.

29:14.227 --> 29:15.628
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you imagine that?

29:15.788 --> 29:19.791
[SPEAKER_02]: One of these nights where we have to go to the buffet over at Thunder Valley.

29:21.172 --> 29:22.193
[SPEAKER_14]: That is a good buffet.

29:22.553 --> 29:23.013
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

29:23.093 --> 29:26.856
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a little slice of Vegas right here in our backyard.

29:26.876 --> 29:30.558
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to do that the night before New Year's Eve.

29:31.859 --> 29:32.860
[SPEAKER_02]: Do like the Orange Lounge.

29:33.080 --> 29:34.101
[SPEAKER_02]: We can bring the tape recorder.

29:34.401 --> 29:35.181
[SPEAKER_14]: We could do something like that.

29:35.482 --> 29:36.062
[SPEAKER_02]: We should do that.

29:36.242 --> 29:37.002
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I'm down with that.

29:37.022 --> 29:39.723
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like pre-New Year's Eve, eat a whole bunch of sugar-a-thon.

29:39.863 --> 29:40.784
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, sounds good.

29:41.004 --> 29:41.464
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, I'm done.

29:41.624 --> 29:42.625
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, uh, Loki!

29:44.445 --> 29:46.026
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, Loki's eating, so we're gonna go to Angel.

29:46.106 --> 29:46.726
[SPEAKER_14]: Angel, how was your week?

29:46.746 --> 29:47.106
[SPEAKER_14]: How was your day?

29:48.127 --> 29:53.729
[SPEAKER_18]: Played a little bit of Imani this week, uh, 7th style, just cause I haven't bought 8th style yet.

29:54.429 --> 30:00.312
[SPEAKER_18]: But, uh, I kinda gave up after, like, a couple songs, cause my controller's being a pain in the butt.

30:01.750 --> 30:05.193
[SPEAKER_18]: Honestly, like, it's just sticking and being a pain.

30:05.253 --> 30:09.657
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's going to turn out like Rob's controller if I don't be careful, so I need to do something about that.

30:10.537 --> 30:19.325
[SPEAKER_18]: And also, I found a new Korean game addiction that I should probably talk about later, because I don't know if you guys are going to say it's going to suck or not.

30:20.406 --> 30:20.786
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey!

30:22.347 --> 30:28.833
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, the only thing I'm going to give away for now is that it's a mix between, like,

30:29.938 --> 30:58.389
[SPEAKER_14]: Ragnarok meets Final Fantasy meets Commander Keen and I'll tell you right now I ain't leaving Final Fantasy for it because you don't want to know how many people have told me this week Rob, join World of Warcraft no, Rob, join World of Warcraft no, I've worked too hard on Final Fantasy XI I'm probably going to be playing World of Warcraft fuck you, seriously if I have time love you Dan's probably going to be playing World of Warcraft I miss your Mithra I miss her you want to play for my account?

30:58.410 --> 30:59.350
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll play again hell no

31:02.671 --> 31:03.692
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't miss her that much.

31:03.992 --> 31:05.533
[SPEAKER_02]: She's only level, what, seven?

31:06.594 --> 31:07.794
[SPEAKER_02]: And I played for three months?

31:07.974 --> 31:08.475
[SPEAKER_02]: Four months?

31:09.916 --> 31:10.736
[SPEAKER_02]: You know I'm teasing.

31:13.318 --> 31:15.079
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, anyway, off track.

31:15.920 --> 31:16.320
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, yeah.

31:16.940 --> 31:18.901
[SPEAKER_18]: And then I got finals this week, but that's beside the point.

31:19.302 --> 31:20.262
[SPEAKER_18]: Other than that, no school.

31:20.422 --> 31:20.883
[SPEAKER_18]: Yay!

31:22.544 --> 31:22.844
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

31:23.825 --> 31:24.645
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, ready to talk?

31:25.766 --> 31:28.288
[SPEAKER_14]: You got enough potato down where you can talk here?

31:28.508 --> 31:30.129
[SPEAKER_14]: Starchy, how was your week?

31:30.149 --> 31:30.529
[SPEAKER_14]: How was your day?

31:31.618 --> 31:35.541
[SPEAKER_13]: This is my really starchy, really full of sodium meal.

31:36.822 --> 31:38.563
[SPEAKER_13]: That's really good for me, I'm sure.

31:39.424 --> 31:41.786
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways, how'd this week go?

31:42.006 --> 31:43.867
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh yeah, first went to a funeral.

31:44.888 --> 31:45.368
[SPEAKER_13]: That was fun.

31:45.889 --> 31:48.351
[SPEAKER_13]: Got to see lots of family, but there was ham, so that was good.

31:50.512 --> 31:58.198
[SPEAKER_14]: And then... You talking about ham makes me think of this thing that was in the Christmas present that you got me.

31:59.139 --> 32:00.180
[SPEAKER_14]: Did I tell you about this?

32:01.632 --> 32:02.493
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll talk about it later.

32:02.853 --> 32:03.814
[SPEAKER_14]: After the kids go to bed.

32:03.874 --> 32:04.654
[SPEAKER_14]: Later in the show.

32:06.756 --> 32:07.096
[SPEAKER_13]: God.

32:07.276 --> 32:07.676
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways.

32:09.557 --> 32:14.100
[SPEAKER_13]: So then, after that, Wednesday, I didn't do anything.

32:15.561 --> 32:19.284
[SPEAKER_13]: Thursday, I took the day off to take my car down to get the brakes fixed.

32:19.744 --> 32:22.566
[SPEAKER_13]: That was wonderful because it's done now.

32:23.767 --> 32:24.967
[SPEAKER_13]: Play lots of Final Fantasy.

32:24.987 --> 32:28.650
[SPEAKER_13]: I was going to work on the cabinet.

32:29.190 --> 32:30.531
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually did work on the cabinet.

32:31.288 --> 32:41.476
[SPEAKER_13]: and my DDR pads create too much static electricity and it ends up temporarily shorting out the IPEC every time I use them.

32:42.918 --> 32:46.420
[SPEAKER_13]: So I gotta modify them again, slightly, hopefully.

32:47.381 --> 32:48.422
[SPEAKER_13]: And hopefully that'll fix it.

32:49.483 --> 32:51.705
[SPEAKER_13]: If not, I gotta chuck them.

32:52.245 --> 32:53.006
[SPEAKER_13]: That makes me sad.

32:54.026 --> 32:54.447
[SPEAKER_13]: But, um...

32:55.683 --> 33:06.167
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, so I worked on that and lots of Final Fantasy and I had to make cookies for tomorrow at work because our boss volunteered us.

33:07.267 --> 33:09.288
[SPEAKER_14]: You had to make cookies or your mom had to make cookies?

33:10.188 --> 33:11.128
[SPEAKER_13]: I had to make cookies.

33:12.029 --> 33:12.609
[SPEAKER_18]: Impressive.

33:13.369 --> 33:14.529
[SPEAKER_13]: Shit, it's just cookies.

33:15.050 --> 33:15.730
[SPEAKER_18]: Did you toss them?

33:17.410 --> 33:18.611
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I did not toss the cookies.

33:20.471 --> 33:22.272
[SPEAKER_13]: So yeah, he volunteered us to do this.

33:23.447 --> 33:24.528
[SPEAKER_13]: and none of us wanted to do it.

33:24.829 --> 33:29.232
[SPEAKER_13]: And then he's like, yeah, we'll do it as a team, but I'm not going to do it.

33:30.794 --> 33:33.676
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, I ended up having to make cookies and they looked like nipples.

33:37.019 --> 33:41.022
[SPEAKER_13]: And I also sold some other cookies for my mom's house.

33:41.963 --> 33:44.385
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's some that look like croissants that are pretty good.

33:44.405 --> 33:45.886
[SPEAKER_13]: Those are good.

33:46.226 --> 33:49.709
[SPEAKER_13]: And I ate all the butter cookies that she had, she gave me.

33:50.270 --> 33:51.911
[SPEAKER_13]: So, oh, so good.

33:54.204 --> 33:56.385
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, and I saw Blade Trinity yesterday, and that was good.

33:58.566 --> 34:01.807
[SPEAKER_13]: I just didn't really care anymore, but Ryan Reynolds made it funny.

34:01.828 --> 34:05.309
[SPEAKER_13]: Because Wesley Snipes, just eh.

34:05.750 --> 34:07.931
[SPEAKER_13]: But Ryan Reynolds being a jackass, that was good.

34:10.232 --> 34:10.512
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all.

34:12.250 --> 34:14.251
[SPEAKER_14]: Ryan Reynolds is Alanis Morissette's fiancee.

34:14.551 --> 34:14.971
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you know that?

34:15.732 --> 34:15.972
[SPEAKER_14]: I did.

34:16.092 --> 34:16.612
[SPEAKER_14]: How sad is that?

34:17.532 --> 34:19.333
[SPEAKER_02]: You're the resident Alanis fan.

34:19.433 --> 34:20.013
[SPEAKER_14]: I totally am.

34:20.414 --> 34:23.115
[SPEAKER_14]: That was the music I was listening to before Bomani, and still really.

34:23.275 --> 34:25.276
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I can't listen to DDR music 24-7.

34:25.556 --> 34:26.777
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know how some people out there do that.

34:27.037 --> 34:38.002
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know it's ironic considering the radio station that we do, but even in the radio station we do, I think we have enough diversions away from the normal playlist where even if you listen to our station 24-7, you wouldn't be hearing Bomani 24-7.

34:39.322 --> 34:40.723
[SPEAKER_14]: I like listening to other music once in a while.

34:41.443 --> 34:43.564
[SPEAKER_14]: We can hear a lot of that randomness on Jamie's show.

34:43.904 --> 34:50.088
[SPEAKER_14]: If you ever wondered why does Jamie's show exist on a video gaming network when she plays complete random stuff, that's why.

34:50.348 --> 34:52.710
[SPEAKER_14]: Because you can't listen to gaming music 24-7, I'm sorry.

34:53.450 --> 34:55.791
[SPEAKER_14]: You gotta appreciate the other music that's out there once in a while.

34:55.851 --> 35:00.334
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Jamie is your music appreciation speaker.

35:01.014 --> 35:03.736
[SPEAKER_13]: Just like with all the gamers, once in a while you need to go outside.

35:06.055 --> 35:07.376
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, my week of my day was pretty good.

35:07.856 --> 35:09.938
[SPEAKER_14]: I just played a lot of Final Fantasy myself.

35:10.959 --> 35:12.099
[SPEAKER_14]: I went out last night.

35:12.119 --> 35:13.540
[SPEAKER_14]: I went out to the bar, which was good.

35:13.560 --> 35:16.763
[SPEAKER_14]: It was the first time that my buddy, since he'd been out of the hospital, got to go.

35:16.803 --> 35:17.323
[SPEAKER_14]: We had a good time.

35:17.363 --> 35:20.926
[SPEAKER_14]: I drank a little bit and met some people.

35:21.046 --> 35:23.187
[SPEAKER_14]: I like it when strangers randomly come up and talk to me.

35:23.207 --> 35:25.329
[SPEAKER_14]: And there was this girl there who was just like Karen.

35:25.728 --> 35:29.090
[SPEAKER_14]: from Will and Grace, and that made me love her, because, you know, I love Karen on that show.

35:29.110 --> 35:31.671
[SPEAKER_14]: If you guys watch Will and Grace, you know it's all about Karen on that show.

35:32.851 --> 35:34.012
[SPEAKER_14]: He knows what I'm talking about.

35:34.952 --> 35:37.653
[SPEAKER_14]: And then, you know, I've been doing a lot of stuff at work.

35:37.693 --> 35:47.698
[SPEAKER_14]: I've been busy, busy at work, and it's kind of funny you talk about your boss making you all do this, you know, cooking thing, because we're doing something similar in my work right now, where, you know, we're doing all these winter events.

35:48.038 --> 35:49.359
[SPEAKER_14]: And you have to be politically correct.

35:49.399 --> 35:51.119
[SPEAKER_14]: You can't say Christmas stuff.

35:51.540 --> 35:53.300
[SPEAKER_14]: It's holiday stuff.

35:53.621 --> 35:56.882
[SPEAKER_14]: So we had a holiday ornament decoration contest and everybody had to participate.

35:56.902 --> 36:00.864
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, you didn't have to, but everybody was supposed to participate in.

36:02.156 --> 36:10.100
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was so busy teaching, because that's what I do at my job, I teach, I was so busy that I did not have a chance to decorate my ornament until about two minutes before.

36:10.520 --> 36:18.785
[SPEAKER_14]: So what I did is I printed out a picture of SpongeBob SquarePants' face from the internet, and then I pasted it on the ornament and colored it in yellow highlighter, and it looked pretty.

36:18.805 --> 36:20.566
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a SpongeBob ornament, and it was awesome.

36:21.526 --> 36:24.368
[SPEAKER_14]: And people liked it, though, so, you know, I get points for that.

36:25.088 --> 36:28.370
[SPEAKER_14]: And tomorrow I have to decorate my cube, so what can I say?

36:28.703 --> 36:30.627
[SPEAKER_14]: What is this you're showing in LiveJournal right now?

36:30.988 --> 36:31.308
[SPEAKER_14]: Kitty.

36:32.150 --> 36:33.012
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a puppy!

36:33.292 --> 36:33.814
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, it's a puppy?

36:33.834 --> 36:35.056
[SPEAKER_14]: It looks like a kitty from back here.

36:35.156 --> 36:35.898
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a Sheltie.

36:36.279 --> 36:36.699
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, okay.

36:37.802 --> 36:39.625
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for totally derailing this segment.

36:42.055 --> 36:48.920
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, earlier this week, I picked up Final Fantasy Dawn of Souls, which is Final Fantasy 1 and 2 on the Game Boy Advance, and I can't stop playing it.

36:49.240 --> 37:01.689
[SPEAKER_14]: I haven't even touched Final Fantasy 2 yet, I've just been playing Final Fantasy 1, because they totally redid it, they made the battle system more like 4, and just, everything is more like Final Fantasy 4, but, you know, with Final Fantasy 1's story, and it's awesome.

37:01.809 --> 37:03.771
[SPEAKER_14]: I highly recommend it, if you're a Final Fantasy fan.

37:04.011 --> 37:10.215
[SPEAKER_14]: And the great part is, I will sit there, and while I wait for a party in Final Fantasy 11, I'll play Final Fantasy 1 on my DS.

37:10.575 --> 37:10.755
[SPEAKER_14]: So...

37:11.624 --> 37:13.965
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just a total Final Fantasy whore lately.

37:14.545 --> 37:15.125
[SPEAKER_14]: But that's okay.

37:15.705 --> 37:16.085
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm allowed.

37:17.246 --> 37:18.846
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, so that's pretty much my week and my day.

37:19.766 --> 37:19.966
[SPEAKER_14]: So.

37:21.427 --> 37:22.887
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, we're gonna move right along here.

37:22.987 --> 37:32.150
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what's going on tonight, right now, actually, right now, and I hate talking about reasons for you to leave Orange Lounge Radio because you should be listening to our show, you know, all the time.

37:32.810 --> 37:33.230
[SPEAKER_14]: However...

37:34.505 --> 37:36.486
[SPEAKER_14]: This is as good of an excuse as any, I figure.

37:36.506 --> 37:39.788
[SPEAKER_14]: If you've got to go, I mean, this would be something I would want to listen to, too.

37:40.569 --> 37:42.570
[SPEAKER_14]: MidiHead, you know, we had him on the show a couple weeks ago.

37:43.030 --> 37:46.833
[SPEAKER_14]: He's doing a live spinning thing right now where he's debuting some new material and stuff.

37:46.853 --> 37:50.115
[SPEAKER_14]: It's actually going on right now over on www.midihead.com.

37:50.135 --> 37:52.757
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm trying to work out something where maybe we can play it later.

37:53.657 --> 38:04.004
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm hoping I can hear it a little later, but, you know, if you're a fan of MidiHead and he's a great guy, I know there's a lot of fans out there, you probably would want to check that out at some point, but, you know.

38:04.810 --> 38:05.890
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll be sad if you leave.

38:07.011 --> 38:09.251
[SPEAKER_14]: But no, you gotta support all internet radio, so, you know.

38:10.072 --> 38:10.592
[SPEAKER_14]: Do what you gotta do.

38:10.672 --> 38:11.692
[SPEAKER_14]: No, you're not leaving, Loki.

38:12.432 --> 38:12.913
[SPEAKER_14]: You're stuck.

38:12.933 --> 38:13.693
[SPEAKER_14]: You're under contract.

38:15.633 --> 38:16.894
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, yeah.

38:17.014 --> 38:18.694
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a contract sealed with blood.

38:20.815 --> 38:23.116
[SPEAKER_14]: You get paid in meat.

38:26.077 --> 38:26.397
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

38:29.107 --> 38:30.047
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to go to a break.

38:30.087 --> 38:32.968
[SPEAKER_14]: When we come back from the break, we'll talk about some more stuff going on in the Bomani scene.

38:33.668 --> 38:35.188
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to take a call over Skype.

38:35.208 --> 38:38.949
[SPEAKER_14]: There's actually a couple calls I want to do over Skype tonight, but I've got one I want to do right when we come back.

38:39.549 --> 38:46.991
[SPEAKER_14]: Somebody said something very interesting in our chat room, and it has to do with remixes, and it has to do with you, Loki.

38:47.811 --> 38:50.691
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to have him call in and talk about that when we come back from this break.

38:51.091 --> 38:52.992
[SPEAKER_14]: In this break, I promised a fun theme.

38:53.012 --> 38:58.793
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to do happy music, and this is a lot of happy music that was suggested to us by folks in the chat room.

38:59.628 --> 39:05.250
[SPEAKER_14]: no happy music yes happy music we'll be back here we go

41:09.814 --> 41:24.578
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought a little bit of you today Look how I felt without myself for you Look a little bit at me today You know you gotta try a little harder So you can be my, my, my, my darling Smile, a little smile, let's enjoy the moment

42:05.645 --> 42:08.308
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

42:28.567 --> 42:49.080
[SPEAKER_05]: All you need is love, my love, my love, my love, my love, my love, my love, my love, my love, my love, my love, my love, my love, my love, my love, my love, my love, my love, my love, my love, my love, my love, my love, my love, my love, my love.

43:26.662 --> 43:28.844
Hey, don't forgive me for hurting you.

43:28.985 --> 43:30.406
I'm smiling at you.

43:30.546 --> 43:32.368
I can't go home anymore.

43:32.408 --> 43:34.430
The sweet scent of time is falling.

43:34.590 --> 43:35.051
It repeats.

44:52.193 --> 44:53.534
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

45:15.646 --> 45:17.407
[SPEAKER_17]: Bitch, get a new song.

45:18.067 --> 45:20.548
[SPEAKER_17]: An open letter from Orange Lounge Radio.

45:20.848 --> 45:22.089
[SPEAKER_14]: We are back here on Orange Lounge.

45:22.109 --> 45:22.869
[SPEAKER_14]: Whoops, no we're not.

45:22.889 --> 45:23.329
[SPEAKER_14]: There we are.

45:25.610 --> 45:26.771
[SPEAKER_14]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

45:26.791 --> 45:29.192
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that was the very first promo, I think.

45:30.913 --> 45:32.513
[SPEAKER_14]: Me and the ex actually did that one.

45:33.254 --> 45:35.215
[SPEAKER_14]: You can hear the ex singing in that one.

45:36.155 --> 45:39.176
[SPEAKER_02]: I refused to participate in that one.

45:40.217 --> 45:41.277
[SPEAKER_14]: No sing-along for Jamie.

45:41.297 --> 45:42.538
[SPEAKER_02]: I did do the solitary voice.

45:46.437 --> 45:48.438
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember we came up with that one in your car.

45:51.338 --> 45:52.239
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll play the other one later.

45:52.339 --> 45:53.659
[SPEAKER_14]: It was another one we came up with too.

45:54.059 --> 45:54.939
[SPEAKER_14]: It was really all you.

45:55.479 --> 45:56.200
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, it was Dan.

45:56.640 --> 45:56.880
[SPEAKER_14]: Really.

45:57.500 --> 46:03.121
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the take on me one.

46:04.262 --> 46:05.162
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll get that in a little later.

46:05.922 --> 46:13.327
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, during the break there, Loki was booting up Step Mania because he wanted to show me some dancing characters in Step Mania.

46:13.347 --> 46:15.469
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess there's some new characters that hit the internet this week.

46:15.509 --> 46:18.251
[SPEAKER_14]: What's going on with Step Mania's dancing characters?

46:18.811 --> 46:21.573
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't think there was a scene for character creation, but apparently there is.

46:22.574 --> 46:23.615
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, there's some funny ones.

46:24.595 --> 46:29.218
[SPEAKER_13]: Vivi from Final Fantasy IX was in there as one of the dancing characters.

46:29.279 --> 46:33.381
[SPEAKER_13]: And then a really crappy done Maria from Silent Hill 3, is it?

46:34.362 --> 46:35.543
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't look like Maria, but whatever.

46:35.945 --> 46:37.826
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, so those are available.

46:38.326 --> 46:45.228
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't remember where they are, though, because the link was on DDR Maniacs, but that site's been down for a few days now.

46:45.989 --> 46:47.529
[SPEAKER_13]: But they're out there.

46:48.430 --> 46:49.170
[SPEAKER_13]: God, I can't remember.

46:49.190 --> 46:50.730
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

46:50.750 --> 46:52.511
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a site that has a bunch of stuff on there.

46:53.892 --> 46:57.553
[SPEAKER_13]: They did a bunch of... Crap, I can't remember.

46:57.753 --> 46:59.914
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the same site that hosts all the official ones.

46:59.954 --> 47:03.435
[SPEAKER_13]: They have one that the guy has been ripping them from 5th Mix and 3rd Mix now.

47:04.076 --> 47:05.157
[SPEAKER_13]: Master Chief Master Chief

47:22.065 --> 47:25.767
[SPEAKER_14]: And the song that Loki was playing was some sim file for I'm Your Boogeyman by Xtreme.

47:26.187 --> 47:29.828
[SPEAKER_14]: And I could just picture the Master Chief going, I'm your boogeyman, I'm your boogeyman.

47:29.908 --> 47:32.029
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just a really amazing image.

47:32.389 --> 47:34.050
[SPEAKER_14]: But the Vivi one was really good.

47:34.530 --> 47:37.411
[SPEAKER_14]: That was pretty, I mean, it's not perfect, but it's hilarious.

47:37.491 --> 47:38.912
[SPEAKER_14]: It gets the job done.

47:39.232 --> 47:40.012
[SPEAKER_14]: It's fun to watch.

47:40.072 --> 47:41.413
[SPEAKER_14]: So, definitely check that out.

47:41.453 --> 47:46.655
[SPEAKER_14]: If anybody in our chatroom happens to know where those characters are hosted, feel free to post it in chat.

47:47.015 --> 47:51.077
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, it was on DDR Maniacs, but... But, um...

47:54.542 --> 47:57.506
[SPEAKER_14]: We had a little glitch there on Live 365.

47:57.546 --> 47:58.347
[SPEAKER_14]: Comcast farted.

47:58.467 --> 48:00.250
[SPEAKER_14]: What we're going to do, I don't know if it was Comcast.

48:00.290 --> 48:01.772
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't think it was that.

48:01.812 --> 48:03.654
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think it was a station fart.

48:03.735 --> 48:07.420
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to go to a quick break just to make sure folks have a chance to reconnect.

48:07.460 --> 48:08.441
[SPEAKER_14]: I hate it when that stuff happens.

48:08.762 --> 48:10.144
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll be right back after this, guys.

49:03.106 --> 49:04.387
Thank you for watching!

50:00.015 --> 50:01.696
[SPEAKER_14]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

50:01.716 --> 50:02.217
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry about that.

50:02.257 --> 50:04.218
[SPEAKER_14]: We had some kind of station hiccup.

50:04.278 --> 50:04.938
[SPEAKER_14]: Something happened.

50:05.439 --> 50:06.499
[SPEAKER_14]: It happens once in a while.

50:07.080 --> 50:08.521
[SPEAKER_14]: Live 365 or something.

50:08.541 --> 50:11.623
[SPEAKER_14]: There was a faulty connection between our house and Live 365.

50:11.703 --> 50:14.484
[SPEAKER_14]: Either a hiccup on our end or a hiccup on their end.

50:15.685 --> 50:20.649
[SPEAKER_14]: I know Live 365 was doing a bunch of maintenance yesterday, so all the Live 365 stations were down.

50:21.069 --> 50:26.153
[SPEAKER_14]: We were down, DDR Freak Radio, Understation Live, all the Live 365 stations were down yesterday.

50:26.614 --> 50:32.358
[SPEAKER_14]: So maybe something's going on with that, I don't know, but we do appear that we are back.

50:32.698 --> 50:41.225
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember, if you ever miss any or all of a show, any part, all of whatever, you can hear the show in its entirety on DDR Freak Radio Live.

50:41.505 --> 50:44.826
[SPEAKER_14]: Friday nights, 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time is when that airs.

50:45.626 --> 50:46.466
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to be interesting, though.

50:46.486 --> 50:50.267
[SPEAKER_14]: I have no idea how that hiccup is going to translate into the archive.

50:50.347 --> 50:53.607
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it just keeps right on going, so you'll hear us going, Crap!

50:53.627 --> 50:54.407
[SPEAKER_00]: Station down!

50:55.308 --> 50:56.208
[SPEAKER_00]: All hands on deck!

50:58.488 --> 50:58.808
[SPEAKER_14]: Weird.

50:59.108 --> 51:00.288
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't know what's going on with that.

51:00.328 --> 51:08.990
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, before we got dropped there, we were talking about new dancing characters in Step Mania, and it looks like Loki found the site where you can actually get those dancing characters from, right?

51:09.912 --> 51:11.093
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it's not this site.

51:11.133 --> 51:13.494
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought it was the same site, but it doesn't look like it is.

51:13.875 --> 51:15.876
[SPEAKER_13]: It was PlasmaDance.com was where some of them were.

51:16.497 --> 51:22.481
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so some of them are on there, PlasmaDance.com, so you can check that out if you are curious about it.

51:22.521 --> 51:24.082
[SPEAKER_14]: Does it have the Master Chief?

51:24.102 --> 51:25.723
[SPEAKER_14]: Because that's the one people really have to get.

51:25.743 --> 51:26.523
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

51:27.564 --> 51:28.205
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, it doesn't?

51:28.245 --> 51:29.105
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, forget it then.

51:29.926 --> 51:30.686
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't waste your time.

51:31.247 --> 51:31.787
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just kidding.

51:32.087 --> 51:33.228
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a lot of good ones on there, though.

51:33.868 --> 51:34.889
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

51:36.590 --> 51:38.071
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow, trying to get back on track here.

51:38.411 --> 51:38.532
[SPEAKER_14]: Um...

51:39.437 --> 51:57.147
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see, what I wanted to do now is I wanted to actually go to the phones on the Skype line, and if you want to participate in the Skype line, just go to our website, www.orangeloundtrader.com, and click on Interact With Us, and it's got all the details on how you can actually interact with the program.

51:57.207 --> 52:06.612
[SPEAKER_14]: And actually, there's a specific person I'm looking to hear from that I'm hoping will be calling us in a minute here, because he was talking about something in chat earlier.

52:07.617 --> 52:10.038
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're going to open up the Skype line so he can get through.

52:10.639 --> 52:14.381
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm specifically looking for the person I have a prearranged phone interview with.

52:14.481 --> 52:16.082
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you're somebody else, don't worry.

52:16.102 --> 52:17.663
[SPEAKER_14]: You'll have an opportunity to call him to the show later.

52:19.144 --> 52:20.305
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

52:21.845 --> 52:24.727
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, is my phone on?

52:24.947 --> 52:26.128
[SPEAKER_14]: You're fading out there a little bit.

52:26.168 --> 52:29.430
[SPEAKER_14]: Make sure all your other transfers and your bandwidth is open there.

52:30.170 --> 52:30.631
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you hear us?

52:32.712 --> 52:33.052
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello.

52:33.772 --> 52:34.013
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello.

52:34.333 --> 52:34.473
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi.

52:34.513 --> 52:34.573
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi.

52:36.756 --> 52:37.316
[SPEAKER_12]: Am I okay?

52:37.656 --> 52:38.537
[SPEAKER_14]: I think so.

52:38.637 --> 52:39.837
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll just keep going with this.

52:39.877 --> 52:40.318
[SPEAKER_14]: Who is this?

52:41.238 --> 52:42.358
[SPEAKER_12]: This is John Fields.

52:42.639 --> 52:43.539
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, John Fields.

52:43.559 --> 52:43.999
[SPEAKER_14]: How are you?

52:44.900 --> 52:45.600
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm doing fine.

52:45.820 --> 52:46.120
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

52:46.160 --> 52:47.841
[SPEAKER_14]: What did you call in to talk to us about tonight?

52:47.981 --> 52:49.001
[SPEAKER_14]: By OC Remix.

52:49.441 --> 52:49.842
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what?

52:50.122 --> 52:50.462
[SPEAKER_14]: Right now.

54:19.500 --> 54:24.922
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that song's kind of fitting right now, a little gentle stress being caused by faulty internet connections.

54:24.962 --> 54:26.842
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to keep going with this best we can, guys.

54:27.603 --> 54:29.263
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what to tell you, though, about that.

54:30.824 --> 54:31.944
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if it's on our end.

54:32.044 --> 54:35.565
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think it's on our end, because we haven't been having any internet problems for a long time now.

54:35.585 --> 54:42.548
[SPEAKER_14]: I know we used to have a lot of problems with internet here, but ever since the really cool tech guy came out, we haven't really been having problems, have we, Loki?

54:43.508 --> 54:43.908
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it's...

54:45.049 --> 54:47.612
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, the real cool tech guy came out and just used pliers.

54:47.693 --> 54:49.675
[SPEAKER_13]: Something I could have done in like three seconds.

54:49.875 --> 54:50.536
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what?

54:50.576 --> 54:51.638
[SPEAKER_14]: He thought of it and you didn't.

54:51.678 --> 54:52.339
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the point.

54:53.280 --> 54:57.125
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I can't help it if he's more experienced with their faulty equipment.

54:57.626 --> 54:58.827
[SPEAKER_14]: So, yeah.

54:58.947 --> 55:01.971
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, again, if you missed all our part, you can always tune into...

55:03.854 --> 55:05.035
[SPEAKER_14]: And now we're having sound issues.

55:05.115 --> 55:07.477
[SPEAKER_14]: My God, if enough stuff wouldn't break around here.

55:09.378 --> 55:12.761
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, you can always tune in to DDR Free Radio to hear the archive in full.

55:13.641 --> 55:19.526
[SPEAKER_14]: Along with other live programming that goes on throughout the week here on Orange Lounge Radio, which usually doesn't get affected by this kind of stuff.

55:19.546 --> 55:23.288
[SPEAKER_14]: You can tune in to Pump Up the Volume on Tuesday nights, hosted by the lovely Dark Sakura.

55:24.129 --> 55:27.291
[SPEAKER_14]: Monday nights, Diversion, Orange Lounge Radio, Bomani Remixes.

55:27.952 --> 55:29.473
[SPEAKER_14]: And Thursday nights...

55:30.242 --> 55:35.745
[SPEAKER_14]: Outside the Box, which will be in reruns this week, actually, because I'm going to be out this week.

55:36.165 --> 55:38.146
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to be out and about in L.A.

55:38.206 --> 55:38.947
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm actually going to L.A.

55:38.967 --> 55:39.187
[SPEAKER_14]: this week.

55:39.207 --> 55:47.711
[SPEAKER_14]: I was kind of hoping that I'd get to go to Arcade Infinity while I was down in L.A., but it doesn't look like that's going to happen, because me and four coworkers actually have to share a car.

55:47.771 --> 55:48.392
[SPEAKER_14]: Doesn't that suck?

55:50.373 --> 55:51.573
[SPEAKER_02]: A tremendous amount of ass.

55:51.634 --> 55:55.255
[SPEAKER_02]: However, there's a good noodle place over there by A.I.

55:56.696 --> 55:57.877
[SPEAKER_02]: You can suggest going there for dinner.

55:58.615 --> 55:59.535
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe, I don't know.

56:00.476 --> 56:01.796
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really, really a good place.

56:01.816 --> 56:03.937
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll have to see.

56:04.657 --> 56:06.338
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, more to do.

56:07.958 --> 56:09.639
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're still getting sound issues.

56:09.659 --> 56:10.880
[SPEAKER_14]: This is bad.

56:10.920 --> 56:11.540
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, guys.

56:13.481 --> 56:14.221
[SPEAKER_14]: Everything's breaking.

56:15.546 --> 56:16.386
[SPEAKER_14]: We keep going down.

56:16.867 --> 56:17.907
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to call it a show.

56:19.308 --> 56:20.289
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm getting pretty pissy here.

56:20.949 --> 56:21.309
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll see.

56:21.909 --> 56:22.370
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll keep going.

56:22.390 --> 56:23.190
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go get sushi.

56:23.670 --> 56:24.191
[SPEAKER_14]: Seriously?

56:24.211 --> 56:25.091
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm like, mmm, food.

56:25.111 --> 56:35.177
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, let's go to another break and just kind of hope things are good when we come back and we'll try calling John again and get out some more Bomani news and just keep doing what we do here.

56:35.577 --> 56:37.738
[SPEAKER_14]: So we'll be back after this little break here.

56:38.378 --> 56:41.940
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we'll do that Silent Hill break I was talking about earlier.

56:42.541 --> 56:43.121
[SPEAKER_14]: So we'll be back.

56:43.861 --> 56:45.222
[SPEAKER_14]: Happy holidays to everybody out there.

57:12.880 --> 57:14.608
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

58:37.876 --> 58:38.857
Thank you for watching!

58:59.938 --> 59:09.022
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be a much better fight With you, with me If you hadn't met me I'd be fine on my own, baby Never felt so lonely when you came along

59:18.986 --> 59:20.707
[SPEAKER_05]: So now what should I do?

59:20.867 --> 59:28.789
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm strung out, addicted to you My body aches, now that you're gone My supplies fell through Let me give me everything you have

59:39.552 --> 59:40.393
Thank you for watching!

01:00:24.705 --> 01:00:37.449
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope you're drinking and toasting It's such a special day Tonight, tonight, oh, I love you

01:00:53.263 --> 01:01:00.410
Christmas is here, Christmas is here Night, nightfall, I love you

01:01:48.287 --> 01:01:51.689
[SPEAKER_17]: We often wonder how some of those Bomani songs are chosen.

01:01:57.833 --> 01:01:58.955
[SPEAKER_11]: We think we figured it out.

01:01:58.975 --> 01:02:00.076
[SPEAKER_11]: Orange Lounge Radio.

01:02:00.096 --> 01:02:00.557
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, we're back.

01:02:15.959 --> 01:02:17.220
[SPEAKER_14]: And hopefully things are stable.

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:21.083
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the internet is just completely fucked tonight, basically, is what it boils down to.

01:02:21.103 --> 01:02:28.389
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I notice people keep dropping from our chat room, left and right, and the Skype chat a little bit earlier was really kind of freaky.

01:02:28.769 --> 01:02:30.151
[SPEAKER_14]: So, we're under attack!

01:02:30.791 --> 01:02:32.192
[SPEAKER_14]: The internet is screwed!

01:02:32.853 --> 01:02:33.793
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what's going on.

01:02:34.434 --> 01:02:35.595
[SPEAKER_02]: The internet's on vacation.

01:02:36.436 --> 01:02:37.977
[SPEAKER_02]: I cannot find anything on this damn game.

01:02:38.390 --> 01:02:38.550
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello?

01:02:38.570 --> 01:02:39.091
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, John, you there?

01:03:05.626 --> 01:03:05.806
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep.

01:03:06.067 --> 01:03:07.588
[SPEAKER_14]: Good, and you sound a lot better this time.

01:03:08.049 --> 01:03:09.631
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I think the internet might be fixed.

01:03:10.392 --> 01:03:10.652
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

01:03:10.792 --> 01:03:11.213
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll see.

01:03:11.413 --> 01:03:12.414
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, from the top.

01:03:12.795 --> 01:03:16.139
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you were in the Overclocked Remix channel this week.

01:03:16.899 --> 01:03:17.100
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep.

01:03:17.340 --> 01:03:18.802
[SPEAKER_14]: And you were asking about fusion mixes.

01:03:19.784 --> 01:03:35.249
[SPEAKER_12]: Right, I was wondering, after what came out today, which was, I believe, another B4U remix or something like that, I was wondering if maybe we could try getting Loki's remixes in there just for fun.

01:03:35.329 --> 01:03:40.150
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, first you've got to talk Loki into it, because he's pretty protective over his material there.

01:03:42.429 --> 01:03:44.610
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I spoke with one of the higher-ups today.

01:03:46.231 --> 01:03:46.791
[SPEAKER_12]: The higher-up?

01:03:46.871 --> 01:03:51.334
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there an OC hierarchy or something?

01:03:51.414 --> 01:03:52.554
[SPEAKER_14]: The Trump of OC?

01:03:52.594 --> 01:03:53.415
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, no, I'm kidding.

01:03:54.435 --> 01:04:02.420
[SPEAKER_12]: Basically, what it is, is it's like most of the chat channel users are unvoiced, and the higher-ups, they are voiced.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:03.260
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:07.622
[SPEAKER_12]: And then there's pretty much DJ Pretzel and then a couple of bots, I think, up at top.

01:04:07.942 --> 01:04:08.203
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

01:04:09.303 --> 01:04:09.963
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, gotcha.

01:04:10.564 --> 01:04:10.884
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was...

01:04:11.383 --> 01:04:14.846
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow, now how many DDR remixes are on OC Remix?

01:04:15.787 --> 01:04:16.608
[SPEAKER_12]: Not a lot, right?

01:04:16.628 --> 01:04:19.611
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's like three or four right now, I think.

01:04:33.615 --> 01:04:34.316
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you say, Loki?

01:04:35.337 --> 01:04:36.579
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, he's looking at the site right now.

01:04:38.081 --> 01:04:39.683
[SPEAKER_12]: He's sizing it up.

01:04:39.924 --> 01:04:40.164
[SPEAKER_14]: What?

01:04:40.785 --> 01:04:42.827
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a request for more Bimani, actually.

01:04:42.847 --> 01:04:44.870
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a request for more Bimani.

01:04:44.970 --> 01:04:46.432
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, I'm moving the mic over to you.

01:04:46.452 --> 01:04:46.993
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you think of this?

01:04:48.755 --> 01:04:49.837
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

01:04:52.168 --> 01:04:53.529
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, see, I like OC Remix.

01:04:53.589 --> 01:04:54.189
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a good site.

01:04:54.229 --> 01:04:55.990
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a lot of really good remixes on there.

01:04:56.311 --> 01:04:58.052
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it would be pretty exciting if you got it on there.

01:04:58.372 --> 01:04:59.012
[SPEAKER_14]: And you know what?

01:04:59.172 --> 01:05:05.536
[SPEAKER_14]: Yet again, you could just continue to kick those people who say that Fusion remixes are not real remixes.

01:05:05.836 --> 01:05:19.745
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, not only did you get MidiHead, who actually has a song in DDR on here a couple weeks ago, saying he used his ass in his mixes, but then you could get one of these mixes on OC Remix and you would just, you know, you would have the hugest internet penis.

01:05:19.985 --> 01:05:20.726
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, seriously.

01:05:21.586 --> 01:05:22.767
[SPEAKER_14]: Almost as big as Jason's.

01:05:23.127 --> 01:05:29.589
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think it would fall, I think under the fact, if I remember correctly, I don't think it would be allowed, actually.

01:05:29.609 --> 01:05:38.993
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, no, I don't think it would work.

01:05:40.214 --> 01:05:47.817
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't think it would work because of the fact that you mix your songs with other songs that are already out there, so you're kind of using too much commercial music, is that what you think the problem is?

01:05:49.588 --> 01:05:55.153
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it's copyright music, because I have no permission from the original artist.

01:05:56.754 --> 01:05:59.357
[SPEAKER_13]: But, I mean, I don't know.

01:05:59.697 --> 01:06:03.400
[SPEAKER_12]: There are songs on there that have remixed licensed songs, I think.

01:06:03.721 --> 01:06:07.444
[SPEAKER_12]: I think there's like a Jingle Bells on there, mixed with Super Mario World, I think.

01:06:09.106 --> 01:06:11.428
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, but Jingle Bells is public domain.

01:06:12.449 --> 01:06:12.869
[SPEAKER_13]: I think so.

01:06:13.770 --> 01:06:15.031
[SPEAKER_13]: Wait, maybe, I don't know.

01:06:15.430 --> 01:06:18.091
[SPEAKER_14]: Even the happy birthday song is not public domain, if you can believe that.

01:06:18.251 --> 01:06:21.732
[SPEAKER_14]: You know every time you sing the happy birthday song, you're supposed to give some guy a quarter, basically?

01:06:22.132 --> 01:06:24.273
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, not really, but you know, happy birthday is a copyrighted song.

01:06:24.853 --> 01:06:26.874
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, Loki's gonna look into it, John.

01:06:27.174 --> 01:06:28.254
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the most we can do for you.

01:06:28.914 --> 01:06:29.515
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

01:06:29.615 --> 01:06:31.155
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm hoping he'll do it.

01:06:31.195 --> 01:06:31.895
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it would be good.

01:06:32.616 --> 01:06:32.876
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

01:06:33.136 --> 01:06:35.257
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm all for whoring out the show everywhere possible.

01:06:36.297 --> 01:06:36.577
[SPEAKER_14]: You know.

01:06:36.637 --> 01:06:38.938
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for looking out for us, so keep us posted.

01:06:39.578 --> 01:06:39.918
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

01:06:40.078 --> 01:06:40.598
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, later.

01:06:41.359 --> 01:06:41.579
[SPEAKER_14]: Bye.

01:06:41.639 --> 01:06:41.839
[SPEAKER_14]: Bye.

01:06:43.755 --> 01:06:45.336
[SPEAKER_14]: Our chat room is being a bunch of babies again.

01:06:46.496 --> 01:06:49.397
[SPEAKER_14]: They're complaining because the webcam isn't showing anything.

01:06:50.658 --> 01:06:53.479
[SPEAKER_14]: Angel, go sit on the couch so they have someone to look at.

01:06:56.220 --> 01:06:59.121
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm forcing Angel to go sit on the couch so you have someone to look at.

01:07:00.421 --> 01:07:02.102
[SPEAKER_14]: That was my impression of the chat room.

01:07:02.362 --> 01:07:05.623
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't say that you can't, so I guess you could.

01:07:06.483 --> 01:07:08.584
[SPEAKER_13]: I could submit it because it doesn't say that you can't.

01:07:08.664 --> 01:07:11.225
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not in their submission guideline things here.

01:07:11.832 --> 01:07:15.816
[SPEAKER_13]: All it says is that, you know, you have to be the original artist of, you know, whatever it is.

01:07:16.636 --> 01:07:18.198
[SPEAKER_13]: But it doesn't say you can't.

01:07:19.078 --> 01:07:23.102
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, well... Okay, I don't know.

01:07:24.663 --> 01:07:27.046
[SPEAKER_14]: The worst that could happen is they call you a lamer.

01:07:27.286 --> 01:07:27.786
[SPEAKER_14]: Honestly.

01:07:29.428 --> 01:07:31.369
[SPEAKER_14]: What's the worst that could happen if you submitted a song?

01:07:33.211 --> 01:07:33.711
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

01:07:34.832 --> 01:07:37.895
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm trying to talk him into doing it, but he's being a pussy.

01:07:39.321 --> 01:07:48.144
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, anyway, moving right along, what's this stuff, you were talking during the break there, you were reading some various Bomani sites, finding out something going on with Poppin' Music?

01:07:48.244 --> 01:07:56.766
[SPEAKER_02]: Poppin' Music Iroha, which I don't know crap about because I wasn't keeping up with Poppin' Music, but apparently Poppin' Music Iroha was out last week, so.

01:07:58.426 --> 01:07:59.587
[SPEAKER_14]: And is that just Poppin' Music 12?

01:07:59.787 --> 01:08:03.088
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't, yeah, I think so.

01:08:03.108 --> 01:08:03.208
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it?

01:08:03.228 --> 01:08:03.488
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

01:08:04.403 --> 01:08:04.783
[SPEAKER_14]: Hooray!

01:08:04.843 --> 01:08:06.044
[SPEAKER_14]: Another poppin' music!

01:08:06.104 --> 01:08:07.525
[SPEAKER_14]: Just what we need right now, you know?

01:08:07.946 --> 01:08:09.286
[SPEAKER_14]: No, actually, I like poppin' music.

01:08:10.107 --> 01:08:14.330
[SPEAKER_14]: Good time, but... I would pull up... God, I wish they'd make a new DDR.

01:08:14.730 --> 01:08:20.474
[SPEAKER_02]: On my laptop, but I still need to install the Japanese language patch, so... Alright.

01:08:21.435 --> 01:08:23.416
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you say we get into a cage match for tonight?

01:08:24.257 --> 01:08:24.677
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure!

01:08:24.917 --> 01:08:28.660
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, let's cue up the music, then.

01:08:31.138 --> 01:08:32.819
[SPEAKER_14]: Who's going to go first in tonight's cage match?

01:08:32.839 --> 01:08:36.000
[SPEAKER_14]: You know we had to retire somebody last week, so now we get to go in whatever order we want.

01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:36.961
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't you start, Rob?

01:08:37.241 --> 01:08:37.941
[SPEAKER_14]: I get to start?

01:08:38.081 --> 01:08:38.482
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, goody.

01:08:40.382 --> 01:08:40.723
[SPEAKER_14]: Hold on.

01:08:42.043 --> 01:08:42.323
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

01:10:39.372 --> 01:10:51.097
[SPEAKER_14]: My song is a song called Bitch, and it's by a group called J-Punch, and it's from this Trance Anthems compilation I found, and I liked it.

[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty good, I have to say.

01:14:14.414 --> 01:14:17.094
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot more energetic than most trance you play.

01:14:17.114 --> 01:14:19.155
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's an eight.

01:14:20.475 --> 01:14:21.355
[SPEAKER_14]: And you are a bitch.

01:14:22.476 --> 01:14:23.276

[SPEAKER_14]: That's pretty cool.

01:14:32.824 --> 01:14:33.045
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

01:14:33.085 --> 01:14:33.185
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki!

01:14:33.205 --> 01:14:33.585
[SPEAKER_14]: This is okay.

01:14:33.625 --> 01:14:34.226
[SPEAKER_14]: Eight and a half.

01:14:51.881 --> 01:14:53.643
[SPEAKER_14]: I give it an 8.

01:14:54.123 --> 01:15:03.591
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, honestly, I didn't think you guys would like that one at all, and it looks like our chatroom doesn't, so it probably doesn't have much of a chance, but even though it's a little repetitive, I like songs that say bitch.

01:15:03.711 --> 01:15:04.311
[SPEAKER_14]: What can I say?

01:15:05.492 --> 01:15:06.573
[SPEAKER_14]: So it gets 8 points for that.

01:15:06.913 --> 01:15:08.855
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, let's move on to Jamie's pick.

01:15:08.875 --> 01:15:09.856
[SPEAKER_14]: Jamie, what'd you pick tonight?

01:15:11.094 --> 01:15:17.958
[SPEAKER_02]: I chose a song that I'm sure everyone's probably heard, but it just really suited my mood for the past week or so.

01:15:19.119 --> 01:15:22.000
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Delirium with Sarah McLachlan, Silence.

01:15:23.141 --> 01:15:26.723
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just really, it's very, very somber.

01:15:27.364 --> 01:15:29.325
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, so a mood-fitting one.

01:15:29.905 --> 01:15:36.529
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and really, I just put it in because I've been listening to it just off and on all week, so...

01:15:38.576 --> 01:15:39.976
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, let's hear it.

01:15:40.016 --> 01:15:41.097
[SPEAKER_14]: Delirium with silence.

01:15:41.177 --> 01:15:41.597
[SPEAKER_14]: Enjoy.

01:15:41.617 --> 01:15:45.718
[SPEAKER_14]: Delirium with silence.

01:17:17.984 --> 01:17:20.465
Lyrics, Lyrics, Lyrics, Lyrics

01:18:34.123 --> 01:18:35.150
DarkSakura.com

01:19:51.234 --> 01:19:56.598
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, that was song number two in tonight's cage match, courtesy of DarkSakura, Delirium, with Sarah McLachlan, Silence.

01:19:57.697 --> 01:19:58.357
[SPEAKER_14]: Jamie, what'd you think?

01:19:58.997 --> 01:19:59.738
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that song.

01:19:59.898 --> 01:20:07.540
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, I've been listening to it a whole bunch, so it gets an automatic 10 for me, just from having been completely fitting my mood all week.

01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:08.240
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

01:20:08.260 --> 01:20:09.401
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a de-stressing song.

01:20:09.881 --> 01:20:10.261
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

01:20:10.521 --> 01:20:10.921
[SPEAKER_14]: Fair enough.

01:20:10.961 --> 01:20:11.221
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki.

01:20:12.742 --> 01:20:13.082
[SPEAKER_13]: God.

01:20:14.302 --> 01:20:16.763
[SPEAKER_13]: This sounds like a sex scene, that's all it sounds like.

01:20:18.063 --> 01:20:19.724
[SPEAKER_13]: I've heard this song so many times.

01:20:21.244 --> 01:20:21.765
[SPEAKER_13]: It's good.

01:20:21.785 --> 01:20:23.685
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's an 8.

01:20:25.806 --> 01:20:26.006
[SPEAKER_00]: Angel.

01:20:26.574 --> 01:20:29.855
[SPEAKER_18]: It's Delirium, so I would probably give it a 9.

01:20:32.015 --> 01:20:51.320
[SPEAKER_14]: Me, personally, about two years ago I would have given that song a 10, but I've played the fuck out of it since then, so I would give it an 8, but then I remembered that Delirium's kind of popular again in the Bomani scene because of After All being an Ultramix 2, so that's a good chance for those that haven't heard that song before to kind of hear a little bit else of Delirium, so I give it a 9 overall.

01:20:52.540 --> 01:20:52.820
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

01:20:54.252 --> 01:20:57.874
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see, song number three tonight comes to you courtesy of Loki.

01:20:58.254 --> 01:21:04.456
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember, if you don't agree with our votes, which apparently in the chat room a lot of you guys disagree with the way we felt about song number one, and you can blow me.

01:21:06.337 --> 01:21:08.678
[SPEAKER_14]: But remember, it does come down to your vote in the chat room.

01:21:08.778 --> 01:21:12.580
[SPEAKER_14]: So we'll be voting as soon as this song's done that comes to you via Loki.

01:21:12.620 --> 01:21:13.620
[SPEAKER_14]: And what song are we going to hear?

01:21:15.121 --> 01:21:18.202
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, if you grew up in the 80s, then you already know what this song is.

01:21:18.482 --> 01:21:22.644
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you've watched, you know, The Breakfast Club, then you already know what this song is.

01:21:23.635 --> 01:21:31.280
[SPEAKER_13]: This is the Simple Minds with Don't You Forget About Me, and it's not sung horribly, like myself, or the singer in Karaoke Revolution.

01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:34.702
[SPEAKER_14]: What's up with you guys and old school songs tonight?

01:21:35.422 --> 01:21:36.583
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, fair enough.

01:21:37.003 --> 01:21:39.665
[SPEAKER_14]: Anything's game here in the Orange Lounge Cage Match, and this is it.

01:21:39.725 --> 01:21:41.206
[SPEAKER_14]: Simple Minds, Don't You Forget About Me.

01:21:41.286 --> 01:21:41.526
[SPEAKER_14]: Enjoy.

01:22:26.696 --> 01:22:29.318
Won't you come see about me?

01:22:29.459 --> 01:22:51.118
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be alone, dancing, you know it, baby Tell me your troubles and doubts Giving me everything, inside and out and Love's strange, surreal and bizarre Think of the tender things that we were working on

01:22:52.479 --> 01:23:08.488
[SPEAKER_05]: No change may pull us apart When the light gets into your heart, baby Don't you forget about me Don't, don't, don't, don't Don't you forget about me

01:23:20.335 --> 01:23:21.436
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

01:23:46.790 --> 01:23:47.772
Thanks for watching!

01:24:10.482 --> 01:24:12.264
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

01:24:44.979 --> 01:24:57.864
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't you forget about me Don't, don't, don't, don't Don't you forget about me Will you stand above me Look my way, will you ever love me Rain keeps falling

01:25:14.352 --> 01:25:15.633
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

01:26:11.228 --> 01:26:23.261
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't you forget about me Don't, don't, don't, don't Don't you forget about me But you won't come by Where you call my name

01:27:06.302 --> 01:27:08.408
I won't call my name Will you call my name

01:27:45.885 --> 01:27:47.214
Thanks for watching!

01:28:15.825 --> 01:28:19.726
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, song number three in tonight's Cage Match, Simple Minds, Don't You Forget About Me.

01:28:19.886 --> 01:28:20.346
[SPEAKER_14]: Jamie?

01:28:21.226 --> 01:28:22.587
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the song to bits.

01:28:24.267 --> 01:28:26.388
[SPEAKER_02]: So much, and I'm so glad it's not a crappy remix.

01:28:27.688 --> 01:28:32.949
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, there are 80 songs that I like better, but I really like that one a whole lot, so it gets a nine.

01:28:34.110 --> 01:28:34.870
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, Loki?

01:28:37.531 --> 01:28:39.391
[SPEAKER_13]: I like that song, so it gets a ten.

01:28:40.791 --> 01:28:42.452
[SPEAKER_13]: Because, I don't know...

01:28:45.049 --> 01:28:53.452
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know why, I just, I like that song a lot, and it just reminds me of every, you know, John Hughes film when I see that, you know, or listen to that song.

01:28:53.472 --> 01:28:55.933
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

01:28:55.953 --> 01:28:59.554
[SPEAKER_13]: I wish they'd play it more on the 80s station that we have locally instead of the Reflex.

01:28:59.594 --> 01:29:01.735
[SPEAKER_13]: They play the Reflex goddamn 50 times a day.

01:29:04.456 --> 01:29:07.657
[SPEAKER_14]: I just remembered, I was gonna do a Duran Duran song tonight, and I totally forgot.

01:29:07.757 --> 01:29:08.317
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, anyway.

01:29:09.437 --> 01:29:09.778
[SPEAKER_14]: Angel!

01:29:10.718 --> 01:29:12.779
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, it's 80s, so you know what that means.

01:29:12.799 --> 01:29:13.439
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll give it a 10.

01:29:15.499 --> 01:29:18.320
[SPEAKER_14]: Me personally, I love that song a lot.

01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:21.141
[SPEAKER_14]: I just would have loved it at DDR length a lot more.

01:29:21.361 --> 01:29:25.263
[SPEAKER_14]: That song went on forever, so I give it a 6 for the number of minutes it was.

01:29:29.104 --> 01:29:39.068
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, let's review the songs you can vote for tonight, starting off with song number 1, which is a song called Bitch by J-Punch.

01:29:49.229 --> 01:30:16.523
[SPEAKER_14]: and song number two that you can vote for tonight is Delirium featuring Sarah McLachlan with Silence and song number three you can vote for tonight Simple Minds, Don't You Forget About Me

01:30:26.906 --> 01:30:29.888
[SPEAKER_14]: Place vote now.

01:30:29.948 --> 01:30:34.390
[SPEAKER_14]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.

01:30:34.911 --> 01:30:37.072
[SPEAKER_14]: And we'll tally them up and see who the winner is.

01:30:38.041 --> 01:30:42.089
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, meanwhile, some stuff's going on here locally in town.

01:30:42.129 --> 01:30:46.157
[SPEAKER_14]: We just, um, we found out something going on at one of our local arcades.

01:30:46.197 --> 01:30:48.341
[SPEAKER_14]: We've talked about it a little bit on this show, Arvigil.

01:30:49.637 --> 01:30:50.237
[SPEAKER_14]: RVGL.

01:30:51.417 --> 01:30:55.378
[SPEAKER_14]: And this new rumor has come up, although you can't really call it a rumor.

01:30:55.418 --> 01:31:00.279
[SPEAKER_14]: I would say it's in that stage where it hasn't happened yet, but it's a lot more solid than a rumor.

01:31:00.739 --> 01:31:04.000
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's kind of a... It's a congealed mass.

01:31:04.140 --> 01:31:04.860
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, basically.

01:31:04.900 --> 01:31:12.181
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what you would call it when it's not really a rumor because there's lots of facts backing it up, but it hasn't happened yet either, so it's an almost stage.

01:31:12.481 --> 01:31:15.742
[SPEAKER_14]: But that is that Rosal Goughlin's going to get a 2DX machine, basically.

01:31:16.282 --> 01:31:16.762
Woo-hoo!

01:31:18.076 --> 01:31:19.933
[SPEAKER_14]: What I think is most exciting about this

01:31:20.976 --> 01:31:24.298
[SPEAKER_14]: is the fact that I think this is going to bring people back to RVGL.

01:31:24.318 --> 01:31:29.000
[SPEAKER_14]: Because let's face it, it's winter time now, so there's not as many stupid theme park kids hanging around there.

01:31:30.461 --> 01:31:34.423
[SPEAKER_14]: And honestly, we've been kind of missing something like this for a while.

01:31:34.443 --> 01:31:34.863
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what I mean?

01:31:34.883 --> 01:31:41.547
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember when we used to have those Wednesday nights over at Golfland, and we'd all go, and man, what was new in those days?

01:31:41.627 --> 01:31:43.948
[SPEAKER_14]: That wasn't extreme, was still kind of the... We had Fourth Mix.

01:31:44.308 --> 01:31:44.889
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.

01:31:45.449 --> 01:31:47.090
[SPEAKER_02]: Our big meeting days was back in the day.

01:31:47.110 --> 01:31:47.910
[SPEAKER_02]: Max and Max 2 were the best.

01:31:47.930 --> 01:31:48.210
[SPEAKER_02]: That was it.

01:31:48.230 --> 01:31:49.351
[SPEAKER_02]: We were trying to unlock stuff.

01:31:52.539 --> 01:31:58.681
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I remember that, because everybody was trying to unlock stuff in Max 2, and I kept trying to get AAAs on songs.

01:31:58.841 --> 01:32:04.884
[SPEAKER_14]: I would just play sets of basic songs to try and get AAAs, because that was 10 points off if you could get a AAA.

01:32:04.924 --> 01:32:05.344
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember that?

01:32:05.484 --> 01:32:05.904
[SPEAKER_14]: That was fun.

01:32:06.284 --> 01:32:07.865
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we'd all go to Brookfields afterwards.

01:32:08.465 --> 01:32:17.569
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sure somewhere in your town, I know we're national, in some cases international broadcasts, I know maybe in your neck of the woods you guys do something similar, but we haven't been doing this for about a year and a half when...

01:32:18.129 --> 01:32:19.170
[SPEAKER_14]: And how long do we freaking tell them?

01:32:19.210 --> 01:32:19.550
[SPEAKER_14]: Seriously.

01:32:19.570 --> 01:32:20.772
[SPEAKER_14]: I give it... One week.

01:32:41.551 --> 01:32:42.151
[SPEAKER_13]: and it's inoperable.

01:32:42.171 --> 01:32:42.672
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, broken.

01:32:43.172 --> 01:32:44.072
[SPEAKER_13]: One weekend's broken.

01:32:44.213 --> 01:32:48.115
[SPEAKER_02]: I will take a step further and say that the DVD drive goes out.

01:32:49.916 --> 01:32:50.676
[SPEAKER_13]: One weekend's broken.

01:32:50.756 --> 01:32:58.340
[SPEAKER_13]: They're buying a new monitor for it because I guess the monitor that was on it was fucked and... That was probably like the old sugar monitor, huh?

01:32:58.980 --> 01:32:59.201
Yes.

01:33:00.821 --> 01:33:05.084
[SPEAKER_13]: So, um... I give it a week before the little kids fuck it up.

01:33:05.684 --> 01:33:09.166
[SPEAKER_02]: I still think it's gonna be the DVD drive that goes out or someone's gonna spill something on the panel.

01:33:10.207 --> 01:33:10.847
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to be shit.

01:33:11.188 --> 01:33:16.250
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm afraid it's going to make people even more pissed off because it's just another game that they're not going to fix up.

01:33:18.131 --> 01:33:19.171
[SPEAKER_13]: But hey, whatever.

01:33:19.671 --> 01:33:21.032
[SPEAKER_13]: Whatever makes you happy, I guess.

01:33:21.272 --> 01:33:23.373
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever sinks your battleship.

01:33:27.655 --> 01:33:30.956
[SPEAKER_14]: I totally agree with the fact that some little kid is probably going to spill something on it.

01:33:30.996 --> 01:33:34.157
[SPEAKER_14]: I just hope they put the machine in a place where somebody can watch it.

01:33:35.058 --> 01:33:35.378
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

01:33:36.969 --> 01:33:39.591
[SPEAKER_14]: What can they do to help 2DX not die?

01:33:39.711 --> 01:33:42.313
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you guys think they could do?

01:33:43.694 --> 01:33:49.559
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a guard posted there 24-7 and have a height bar for you to be able to go up to the machine.

01:33:49.819 --> 01:33:51.620
[SPEAKER_14]: That guard will be you, Jamie.

01:33:52.861 --> 01:33:53.822
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll pay me, okay.

01:33:59.006 --> 01:33:59.386
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

01:34:00.287 --> 01:34:02.048
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm tallying up the votes for the cage match right now.

01:34:02.088 --> 01:34:06.612
[SPEAKER_14]: What else do you think would be something fun that we could do to kind of get the crowds going at Golf Land again?

01:34:09.639 --> 01:34:12.020
[SPEAKER_13]: How about they fix my fucking machine that I built them?

01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:15.841
[SPEAKER_13]: They spent all my hard time on and then went to shit really quick.

01:34:15.961 --> 01:34:16.581
[SPEAKER_13]: How about that?

01:34:17.742 --> 01:34:18.502
[SPEAKER_13]: That might be nice.

01:34:20.423 --> 01:34:22.323
[SPEAKER_13]: Seriously, I don't know why I even try anymore.

01:34:22.343 --> 01:34:23.764
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, why do I try?

01:34:23.784 --> 01:34:24.944
[SPEAKER_13]: Because it just goes to shit.

01:34:26.405 --> 01:34:26.785
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck them.

01:34:27.225 --> 01:34:27.785
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what I say.

01:34:27.885 --> 01:34:28.245
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck them.

01:34:28.625 --> 01:34:30.526
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I'm going to make my own machine.

01:34:31.086 --> 01:34:32.307
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll fucking make my own arcade.

01:34:32.607 --> 01:34:33.387
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the way it'll be.

01:34:34.507 --> 01:34:36.228
[SPEAKER_13]: But, you know, I'm just tired of it.

01:34:37.048 --> 01:34:39.069
[SPEAKER_13]: Tired of spending my time there trying to fix shit.

01:34:39.554 --> 01:34:39.974
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, they have Doc!

01:35:09.233 --> 01:35:09.914
[SPEAKER_13]: and Derby on Earth.

01:35:11.436 --> 01:35:12.977
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to go race Gungoro again.

01:35:13.718 --> 01:35:17.001
[SPEAKER_14]: Part of me kind of wants to go to Arvigil tomorrow to see if they got the machine up and running.

01:35:17.262 --> 01:35:28.614
[SPEAKER_14]: I just, another fact that makes me very happy that Arvigil's getting 2DX is that I really don't like going to Svigil to play and I apologize if you're a Svigil regular but there's a lot of you guys that hang out there that are kind of dicks.

01:35:29.375 --> 01:35:38.804
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, but I just feel this very thick dickiness when I walk into Spiggle.

01:35:38.864 --> 01:35:45.431
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like, if you can't pass eight stars, then you suck and you shouldn't even deserve to play here.

01:35:45.451 --> 01:35:50.676
[SPEAKER_14]: And they don't tell people when they get new machines and stuff because they don't want scary newbies around and stuff.

01:35:50.696 --> 01:35:52.718
[SPEAKER_14]: And I just don't like that attitude, you know what I mean?

01:35:53.258 --> 01:36:02.744
[SPEAKER_14]: and I'm sorry, because I have friends that play Svigal, you know, I'm not saying this is a, every single person is like this, but I just feel this aura of shittiness when I walk in there, and I'm sorry.

01:36:03.044 --> 01:36:09.328
[SPEAKER_14]: So that makes me very happy that Arvigil is going to be getting a machine, because I think a lot of people, even though Arvigil is kind of a...

01:36:11.535 --> 01:36:12.156
[SPEAKER_14]: How do you put it?

01:36:12.456 --> 01:36:15.558
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a dump in pretty rapping, basically.

01:36:17.440 --> 01:36:19.261
[SPEAKER_14]: The people there really are pretty good.

01:36:19.661 --> 01:36:25.446
[SPEAKER_14]: And I sense a lot of friendly people and, you know, I think more of a, you know, just try your best type attitude.

01:36:25.486 --> 01:36:26.507
[SPEAKER_14]: At least that's how I feel.

01:36:26.567 --> 01:36:26.867
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

01:36:26.907 --> 01:36:27.628
[SPEAKER_14]: You feel that, Jamie?

01:36:28.108 --> 01:36:28.688
[SPEAKER_14]: Or is it just me?

01:36:30.570 --> 01:36:31.370
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, she's watching.

01:36:31.651 --> 01:36:32.171
[SPEAKER_14]: What about you, Loki?

01:36:32.191 --> 01:36:35.794
[SPEAKER_14]: Have you been to play at Spiegel?

01:36:36.454 --> 01:36:37.195
[SPEAKER_13]: A few times.

01:36:38.032 --> 01:36:39.433
[SPEAKER_13]: It's too cramped for my taste.

01:36:39.953 --> 01:36:42.275
[SPEAKER_13]: They have way too many machines and a way too small arcade.

01:36:42.295 --> 01:36:44.857
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the only thing I got from it.

01:36:46.418 --> 01:36:47.498
[SPEAKER_13]: But, I don't know.

01:36:47.899 --> 01:36:48.859
[SPEAKER_13]: They have In The Groove now.

01:36:50.521 --> 01:36:53.102
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess that's not, I don't know.

01:36:54.283 --> 01:36:56.865
[SPEAKER_13]: I wouldn't want to play In The Groove, but you know, that's just me.

01:36:59.181 --> 01:37:08.346
[SPEAKER_13]: But you know, honestly, I would rather them put in the groove in that cabinet that's broken right now than, you know, have it be just not working at all.

01:37:08.826 --> 01:37:13.128
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I'd rather have that cabinet being used for something other than just to sit there broken.

01:37:15.429 --> 01:37:21.752
[SPEAKER_13]: And if that's what they gotta do, then go ahead, buy the machine, put it in there, so then we can upgrade it to mine with working parts.

01:37:24.694 --> 01:37:27.815
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, I don't want to bash on everybody that goes to Sviggle.

01:37:27.835 --> 01:37:29.576
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not trying to start any drama or anything.

01:37:29.596 --> 01:37:33.838
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just I've had one too many kind of shitty experiences when I was there.

01:37:33.958 --> 01:37:35.839
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm sure there's a lot of great people.

01:37:35.859 --> 01:37:37.579
[SPEAKER_14]: In fact, I know there's a lot of great people that play Sviggle.

01:37:37.619 --> 01:37:40.521
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just that there's a lot of attitude that comes along with Sviggle.

01:37:40.541 --> 01:37:41.501
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't know.

01:37:41.801 --> 01:37:45.963
[SPEAKER_14]: As far as In the Groove goes, you know, I talked about the game before on the show.

01:37:46.003 --> 01:37:48.304
[SPEAKER_14]: I got to play it, and it's okay.

01:37:48.344 --> 01:37:49.364
[SPEAKER_14]: There's things I like about it.

01:37:49.384 --> 01:37:50.385
[SPEAKER_14]: There's things I don't like about it.

01:37:50.765 --> 01:37:52.706
[SPEAKER_14]: I would rather see In the Groove than nothing.

01:37:52.746 --> 01:37:53.987
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it's a nice little addition.

01:37:54.027 --> 01:37:55.547
[SPEAKER_14]: It's something I would play once in a while.

01:37:55.887 --> 01:37:57.788
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not something I'm going to go gaga over.

01:37:58.008 --> 01:38:01.290
[SPEAKER_14]: It is not a replacement for DDR, I don't think.

01:38:02.130 --> 01:38:04.251
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's something to kind of pass the time.

01:38:04.951 --> 01:38:07.473
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, the one thing that always kind of bugged me about...

01:38:08.713 --> 01:38:15.819
[SPEAKER_14]: Excuse me, the one thing that always kind of bugs me about In The Groove is that In The Groove is not DDR unless it's convenient for it to be DDR.

01:38:15.899 --> 01:38:16.400
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what I mean?

01:38:16.840 --> 01:38:20.123
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, when it's convenient to say it's the new DDR, then it's the new DDR.

01:38:20.163 --> 01:38:24.086
[SPEAKER_14]: But when, you know, it's being bashed on, then oh well, you can't say that because it's not DDR.

01:38:24.367 --> 01:38:25.748
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of like, you know, make up your mind.

01:38:25.788 --> 01:38:26.528
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it DDR or not?

01:38:27.089 --> 01:38:28.490
[SPEAKER_14]: So, we'll see.

01:38:29.531 --> 01:38:34.075
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, Jamie, did you have any thoughts on...

01:38:35.582 --> 01:38:38.403
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I'm sorry, I had to take care of some business.

01:38:38.703 --> 01:38:39.123
[SPEAKER_14]: That's alright.

01:38:39.743 --> 01:38:41.244
[SPEAKER_02]: About, in the groove?

01:38:42.144 --> 01:38:46.305
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, anything, either in the groove or Svigel versus, you know, other places.

01:38:46.325 --> 01:38:49.926
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I, Svigel's like... It's not necessarily our Vigel, specifically, just Svigel in general.

01:38:49.946 --> 01:38:57.008
[SPEAKER_02]: No offense to the Sviglers, but walking into that place is like walking into, you know, a garage that somebody's put too much crap in.

01:38:58.449 --> 01:38:58.569
[SPEAKER_02]: It's...

01:39:00.385 --> 01:39:02.165
[SPEAKER_02]: Just not comfortable there.

01:39:03.026 --> 01:39:10.827
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd rather go to Miggle, where there's tons of room, generally nicer, more attentive people, than go waste my time at SVGL.

01:39:11.827 --> 01:39:13.628
[SPEAKER_02]: No offense to any of my friends that go there.

01:39:17.309 --> 01:39:17.989
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I feel.

01:39:19.649 --> 01:39:19.969
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

01:39:20.189 --> 01:39:21.009
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that's what we think.

01:39:21.049 --> 01:39:24.090
[SPEAKER_14]: If you disagree, you're welcome to join the chat or call us on the Skype line a little later.

01:39:24.770 --> 01:39:28.091
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, meanwhile, you guys want to figure out who won the cage match?

01:39:29.502 --> 01:39:35.785
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, we're going to go to Cage Match, and the winner is... This is a very unique situation.

01:39:37.366 --> 01:39:42.148
[SPEAKER_14]: Tonight, in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, we had a three-way tie.

01:39:42.408 --> 01:39:43.248
[SPEAKER_14]: No way!

01:39:43.428 --> 01:39:48.671
[SPEAKER_14]: Three-way tie, and a lot of people voted tonight, and it's still a three-way tie.

01:39:49.311 --> 01:39:50.232
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's the weird thing.

01:39:51.112 --> 01:39:57.575
[SPEAKER_14]: Typically in a three-way tie, then the song that got thrown out, whoever put that song in, gets to vote on the winner.

01:39:58.407 --> 01:40:03.129
[SPEAKER_14]: But the problem is, there is no song being thrown out this week because there are three brand new songs.

01:40:03.869 --> 01:40:14.874
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have to go to Plan B. And basically what happens in Plan B, and I think this has only ever happened one time in show history, is that everybody else in the room who isn't a host gets to vote on the song that wins.

01:40:15.404 --> 01:40:16.385
[SPEAKER_02]: But we only have one person.

01:40:16.465 --> 01:40:18.846
[SPEAKER_14]: Which means there's only one other person here in the room tonight.

01:40:19.506 --> 01:40:22.788
[SPEAKER_14]: That means Angel is going to break the tie, so I gave her a little piece of paper.

01:40:23.328 --> 01:40:28.330
[SPEAKER_14]: She's going to write down on there her favorite song to win tonight's cage match.

01:40:28.431 --> 01:40:29.011
[SPEAKER_14]: No pressure.

01:40:32.813 --> 01:40:34.914
[SPEAKER_14]: But she's thinking about her vote.

01:40:40.497 --> 01:40:40.957
[SPEAKER_14]: That's right.

01:40:47.250 --> 01:40:48.291
[SPEAKER_14]: She's walking to her pen.

01:40:49.612 --> 01:40:51.273
[SPEAKER_14]: She's writing it down on the piece of paper.

01:40:54.275 --> 01:40:54.636
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

01:40:55.817 --> 01:40:56.277
[SPEAKER_14]: You just got it?

01:40:56.337 --> 01:40:56.637
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

01:40:57.378 --> 01:40:59.059
[SPEAKER_14]: I have the vote in my hand.

01:40:59.119 --> 01:41:04.103
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember, once the votes are tallied, the other two songs have to leave.

01:41:06.044 --> 01:41:06.885
[SPEAKER_14]: I will now read the vote.

01:41:10.526 --> 01:41:17.047
[SPEAKER_14]: The winning song of tonight's cage match as decided on by DDR Angel.

01:41:17.548 --> 01:41:20.848
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there any particular, oh I have to ask you first, is there any particular reason you voted for this song?

01:41:22.009 --> 01:41:22.209
[SPEAKER_18]: No.

01:41:26.930 --> 01:41:27.250
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

01:41:30.010 --> 01:41:31.171
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see, should I walk over to the cam?

01:41:31.531 --> 01:41:31.751
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

01:41:32.031 --> 01:41:32.311
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

01:41:34.511 --> 01:41:36.552
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a big moment in Orange Lounge Radio history.

01:41:43.902 --> 01:41:44.522
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see, here we go.

01:41:47.304 --> 01:41:57.790
[SPEAKER_14]: And the winning song for tonight is song number one.

01:41:58.531 --> 01:41:59.731
[SPEAKER_14]: Song number one.

01:42:02.373 --> 01:42:05.835
[SPEAKER_14]: So that means by a three-way tiebreaker,

01:42:06.636 --> 01:42:08.357
[SPEAKER_18]: See, now everyone's dying in the chatroom.

01:42:08.377 --> 01:42:09.038
[SPEAKER_18]: What have I done?

01:42:09.058 --> 01:42:15.823
[SPEAKER_14]: Bitch wins the cage match, which is ironic because it's the song that got dogged on the most by the chatroom.

01:42:18.925 --> 01:42:20.306
[SPEAKER_14]: Hold on, I gotta play the victory lap here.

01:42:25.890 --> 01:42:26.991
[SPEAKER_14]: Bitch wins tonight's cage match.

01:42:27.011 --> 01:42:28.392
[SPEAKER_14]: Any particular reason you picked that one?

01:42:28.652 --> 01:42:32.595
[SPEAKER_14]: You gave that one the lowest score out of the three, so I'm kind of surprised that you voted for that one.

01:42:32.615 --> 01:42:35.678
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I kind of thought of it, and, well, I don't know, I kind of like it.

01:42:35.718 --> 01:42:36.038
[SPEAKER_18]: It's kind of...

01:42:37.314 --> 01:42:41.581
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, it's more, I guess you could call it a club song, I don't know.

01:42:43.383 --> 01:42:44.886
[SPEAKER_18]: Most dancey out of the three, I guess.

01:42:45.492 --> 01:42:50.055
[SPEAKER_14]: That actually makes me happy because the chatroom was so, like, anti that song.

01:42:50.075 --> 01:42:51.196
[SPEAKER_18]: See, they don't like it too bad.

01:42:52.517 --> 01:42:54.319
[SPEAKER_14]: You guys voted for it in a three-way tie.

01:42:54.379 --> 01:42:57.221
[SPEAKER_14]: If any one of you had voted differently, it would have been different.

01:42:57.301 --> 01:42:57.741
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm kidding.

01:42:57.781 --> 01:42:58.502
[SPEAKER_18]: I love you, chatroom.

01:42:58.622 --> 01:42:59.503
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, there you have it.

01:43:00.483 --> 01:43:03.285
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, so Bitch will be back next week with two new songs.

01:43:03.646 --> 01:43:04.286
[SPEAKER_14]: That was good, though.

01:43:04.306 --> 01:43:05.787
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't get three-way ties very often.

01:43:06.288 --> 01:43:10.611
[SPEAKER_14]: But it was an exact, it was a multiple of three votes, and every one had the same amount.

01:43:10.631 --> 01:43:10.851
[SPEAKER_14]: It's crazy.

01:43:10.871 --> 01:43:13.353
[SPEAKER_18]: Wasn't this one, like, the second time it's happened or something?

01:43:13.733 --> 01:43:15.014
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's only like the second time it's happened.

01:43:15.035 --> 01:43:15.295
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

01:43:15.335 --> 01:43:15.515
[SPEAKER_14]: Ever.

01:43:16.776 --> 01:43:17.056
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

01:43:17.297 --> 01:43:18.338
[SPEAKER_18]: I feel special now.

01:43:18.578 --> 01:43:18.998
[SPEAKER_18]: Yay!

01:43:20.600 --> 01:43:20.920
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

01:43:20.980 --> 01:43:24.003
[SPEAKER_14]: We can thank Diebold Voting Machines for bringing us that result.

01:43:24.464 --> 01:43:26.466
[SPEAKER_14]: Just kidding.

01:43:28.007 --> 01:43:33.132
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, we're gonna go to a break and in this break we're gonna hear, I don't know, what kind of music should we hear this break?

01:43:34.493 --> 01:43:35.334
[SPEAKER_14]: Any requests, Jamie?

01:43:35.454 --> 01:43:36.015
[SPEAKER_14]: Anything you want to hear?

01:43:38.422 --> 01:43:49.428
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, very, very, the first ever versions of songs that have been remixed to the point of making people physically ill.

01:43:49.908 --> 01:43:51.069
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, Paranoia.

01:43:51.089 --> 01:43:53.230
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow, okay.

01:43:53.730 --> 01:43:57.052
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow, that is a crazy theme, okay, but we can do that.

01:43:57.092 --> 01:43:57.212
[SPEAKER_02]: Max 300.

01:43:58.032 --> 01:43:58.292
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

01:43:58.492 --> 01:43:59.273
[SPEAKER_02]: Pre-remix.

01:43:59.433 --> 01:43:59.713
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

01:44:00.854 --> 01:44:05.536
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and actually just for the hell of it, because I hadn't heard it in forever, Dropout.

01:44:07.150 --> 01:44:09.411
[SPEAKER_14]: Even though that has nothing to do with... Even though.

01:44:09.611 --> 01:44:09.871
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

01:44:09.911 --> 01:44:11.131
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I can't think of any others.

01:44:11.171 --> 01:44:12.951
[SPEAKER_14]: My God, I don't think I have the original Paranoia.

01:44:12.971 --> 01:44:14.192
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not in the Potpourri directory.

01:44:14.232 --> 01:44:14.772
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, okay.

01:44:14.792 --> 01:44:15.632
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you what.

01:44:15.752 --> 01:44:16.232
[SPEAKER_14]: Trip Machine.

01:44:16.932 --> 01:44:17.492
[SPEAKER_14]: Want Trip Machine?

01:44:18.273 --> 01:44:18.313
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

01:44:18.333 --> 01:44:18.913
[SPEAKER_14]: Do I have Trip Machine?

01:44:18.953 --> 01:44:19.633
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like Trip Machine.

01:44:19.693 --> 01:44:19.973
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

01:44:20.613 --> 01:44:21.453
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll do the next 300.

01:44:21.653 --> 01:44:22.173
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's it.

01:44:24.454 --> 01:44:26.895
[SPEAKER_02]: Throw in QQQ.

01:44:27.995 --> 01:44:28.495
[SPEAKER_14]: QQQ.

01:44:28.695 --> 01:44:29.275
[SPEAKER_14]: For no good reason.

01:44:29.295 --> 01:44:29.795
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

01:44:30.295 --> 01:44:30.995
[SPEAKER_14]: For no good reason.

01:44:31.035 --> 01:44:31.756
[SPEAKER_02]: For no good reason.

01:44:32.256 --> 01:44:33.036
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Taku.

01:44:35.362 --> 01:44:36.905
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say thank you for that.

01:44:37.266 --> 01:44:38.128
[SPEAKER_02]: Ha ha pun.

01:44:39.290 --> 01:44:39.691
[SPEAKER_02]: Shoot me.

01:44:41.154 --> 01:44:43.439
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll be right back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

01:45:37.824 --> 01:45:38.468
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

01:49:00.745 --> 01:49:00.987
[SPEAKER_06]: and more.

01:49:52.032 --> 01:49:56.356
[SPEAKER_17]: Orange Lounge Radio is proud to present a celebrity interview.

01:49:57.216 --> 01:49:58.858
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you introduce yourself for our listeners?

01:49:59.318 --> 01:50:00.159
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm Miss Cleo.

01:50:00.699 --> 01:50:02.280
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, it's great to have you on the show today.

01:50:02.621 --> 01:50:03.782
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello, how are you today?

01:50:04.262 --> 01:50:05.223
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm great, thanks.

01:50:05.403 --> 01:50:06.424
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you have a question?

01:50:06.844 --> 01:50:12.749
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, yes, actually I wanted to know... Can I please have your first name only and your birth date, please?

01:50:13.850 --> 01:50:13.930
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh...

01:50:14.813 --> 01:50:18.455
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, no, I actually just wanted to know what you thought of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:50:18.735 --> 01:50:19.595
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, go ahead.

01:50:19.976 --> 01:50:23.137
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, what do you think of Loki, one of the three hosts of Orange Lounge Radio?

01:50:23.497 --> 01:50:24.398
[SPEAKER_10]: Is he incarcerated?

01:50:25.058 --> 01:50:28.680
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, actually, no, he's not, but what do you think of the ever-ranty Dark Sakura?

01:50:28.820 --> 01:50:30.101
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, dear, how are you?

01:50:30.681 --> 01:50:31.421
[SPEAKER_10]: I love you.

01:50:31.641 --> 01:50:33.142
[SPEAKER_14]: I see you two must know each other.

01:50:33.262 --> 01:50:34.543
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, what do you think of Skye?

01:50:34.863 --> 01:50:36.784
[SPEAKER_10]: Did he used to play football when he was in high school?

01:50:37.044 --> 01:50:38.485
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, actually, no, he didn't.

01:50:38.545 --> 01:50:38.725
[SPEAKER_14]: Haha!

01:50:39.696 --> 01:50:41.557
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, what do you think of Intern Zero?

01:50:41.997 --> 01:50:45.380
[SPEAKER_10]: I want you to really remember the pill, all right?

01:50:45.860 --> 01:50:51.083
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm seeing some forgetting, possibly, and I'm seeing a new baby in the next three months.

01:50:51.824 --> 01:50:52.224
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

01:50:52.524 --> 01:50:55.446
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, well, thanks for being on Orange Lounge Radio today.

01:50:55.586 --> 01:51:04.211
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't mean to sidetrack your question here, but who are all of these nosy people, outside influences I'm seeing around you by the moon card?

01:51:04.391 --> 01:51:05.292
[SPEAKER_17]: Get away from me.

01:51:07.842 --> 01:51:12.663
[SPEAKER_17]: Orange Lounge Radio, helping to free your mind and spirit.

01:51:13.123 --> 01:51:13.963
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm Miss Cleo.

01:51:14.324 --> 01:51:15.064
[SPEAKER_10]: I love you.

01:51:19.405 --> 01:51:22.405
[SPEAKER_14]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:51:23.366 --> 01:51:25.546
[SPEAKER_14]: Episode number 122 in progress.

01:51:26.406 --> 01:51:28.407
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't believe we've been doing this crap this long.

01:51:28.427 --> 01:51:29.147
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you believe that?

01:51:30.587 --> 01:51:32.308
[SPEAKER_14]: I like your shirt there, Angel, that you're wearing.

01:51:32.328 --> 01:51:36.009
[SPEAKER_14]: The old classic Nintendo controller there with the Know Your Roots.

01:51:36.029 --> 01:51:37.329
[SPEAKER_14]: I've seen that for sale before.

01:51:38.163 --> 01:51:46.693
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it's been around, but, you know, I mean... You always wear some kind of 8-bit shirt when you come over here, I notice.

01:51:46.793 --> 01:51:48.475
[SPEAKER_14]: I just, I kind of notice this trend.

01:51:48.515 --> 01:51:51.799
[SPEAKER_14]: You have your, uh, are you the one with the Mega Man shirt?

01:51:51.839 --> 01:51:53.801
[SPEAKER_14]: Or you have the Piranha Plant that says, Bite Me?

01:51:54.061 --> 01:51:55.743
[SPEAKER_18]: I have the Piranha Plant that says, Bite Me.

01:51:55.823 --> 01:51:57.866
[SPEAKER_18]: I have the, uh...

01:51:59.132 --> 01:52:01.333
[SPEAKER_18]: I got Mad Bills, which is the Bullet Bill one.

01:52:01.753 --> 01:52:08.975
[SPEAKER_18]: It's got all the different ones on it.

01:52:09.135 --> 01:52:12.476
[SPEAKER_14]: The only one I have is the Goomba one that says you lose.

01:52:12.516 --> 01:52:16.277
[SPEAKER_14]: I actually wore that to the Live 365 Awards, so that was kind of an omen that year.

01:52:17.817 --> 01:52:27.300
[SPEAKER_18]: Yep, and the same day that I had picked up the Bite Me shirt, I washed it and wore it over here.

01:52:28.072 --> 01:52:29.393
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:53:01.964 --> 01:53:03.665
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll just have to take your word for it, I suppose.

01:53:03.825 --> 01:53:06.186
[SPEAKER_18]: I believe it's Arden, actually, now that I think about it.

01:53:06.386 --> 01:53:07.187
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, fair enough.

01:53:07.767 --> 01:53:09.228
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, let's see.

01:53:09.768 --> 01:53:12.569
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to go on over to Loki, if you don't mind.

01:53:13.270 --> 01:53:17.772
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was curious what's going on in the sim scene right now, besides the dancing characters, of course.

01:53:17.812 --> 01:53:19.313
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there any other news going on out there right now?

01:53:20.734 --> 01:53:24.015
[SPEAKER_13]: Besides numerous websites being down, not really, no.

01:53:24.836 --> 01:53:24.916
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh...

01:53:26.758 --> 01:53:28.820
[SPEAKER_13]: No, really, actually, nothing's going on at all.

01:53:29.340 --> 01:53:31.322
[SPEAKER_13]: I couldn't really tell you any updates on Step Mini.

01:53:31.342 --> 01:53:36.387
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think there have been any new releases of it since Release Candidate 2, if I remember correctly.

01:53:38.589 --> 01:53:50.940
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that they're still hard at work over on DDRUK on getting those sim files out for... Was it a Dancing Stage Fusion and... Let's see...

01:53:52.168 --> 01:54:20.324
[SPEAKER_13]: DDR Festival and Ultramix 2 those are almost done I think Festival is close to being done they're waiting on graphics and Ultramix 2 they're still working on and I would assume by now that Fusion's done because that game's been out forever now I think they're just going to be doing like one update where they have them all up online but still nothing yet on those but should be soon hopefully

01:54:21.400 --> 01:54:44.977
[SPEAKER_13]: and then, um, really other than that, I don't think there's anything else going on, sort of sim-related, um, Funmix Plus, um, it was just announced, actually, that they're going to be releasing, of course, exclusively in Japan, um, a soundtrack for Funmix Plus and Funmix, I guess, it's going to be out there, there's a little demo on the Funmix site, I don't remember the URL by it,

01:54:45.498 --> 01:54:51.846
[SPEAKER_13]: OffChance right now, but that's going to be coming out eventually with all extended tracks and stuff from your favorite Foon Mix artists.

01:54:53.268 --> 01:54:57.654
[SPEAKER_13]: And really other than that, not much going on right now.

01:54:58.234 --> 01:54:58.655
[SPEAKER_13]: Pretty quiet.

01:54:59.707 --> 01:55:01.548
[SPEAKER_14]: That Foon Mix soundtrack sounds pretty exciting, though.

01:55:01.568 --> 01:55:02.568
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd be looking forward to that.

01:55:02.608 --> 01:55:04.168
[SPEAKER_14]: Foon Mix is some good stuff.

01:55:04.328 --> 01:55:13.771
[SPEAKER_14]: And I wouldn't even call them Bomani remixes, because they're almost these completely different songs that are just kind of inspired by familiar Bomani tunes.

01:55:14.151 --> 01:55:17.172
[SPEAKER_14]: Not just those, but their original stuff is freaking great, too.

01:55:17.252 --> 01:55:19.593
[SPEAKER_14]: So hats off to those guys for putting a soundtrack together.

01:55:20.445 --> 01:55:49.741
[SPEAKER_13]: and as I mentioned probably last week and the week before last and so on and so forth um there's the brand new um Diverse Systems album that's coming out called and this was as you may remember Dear Mr. 180 well now we have Dear Mr. Desire which is all remixes which is ironically enough it's remixes of Revenge and Desire songs so um get all your Trip Machine, Cigaru and Healing Vision uh remixes out there um they're all uh on this one um

01:55:50.441 --> 01:55:59.468
[SPEAKER_13]: CD from Diverse Systems, and also the Food Mix CD should be available through Silly Walker, which is another Diverse Systems-like site.

01:56:00.029 --> 01:56:09.736
[SPEAKER_13]: Fortunately, all these sites being located in Japan, they're only selling exclusively in Japan, so it's really hard to get a hold of this stuff, especially if you don't speak Japanese.

01:56:11.077 --> 01:56:14.360
[SPEAKER_13]: It's pretty hard to find it, but it's out there, so you know.

01:56:16.311 --> 01:56:29.809
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that Diverse Systems is re-updating their entire English page, so I'm sure that D7 along with this brand new album should be up there eventually as soon as they get done with that, probably next year.

01:56:32.620 --> 01:56:34.121
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, good times.

01:56:36.803 --> 01:56:38.564
[SPEAKER_14]: Moving right along, excuse me.

01:56:38.624 --> 01:56:57.757
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, going back to a topic that we had going on earlier in this show, John, you know John in our chat room, he actually went to the OC Remix and got one of them to come over here to try and talk you into, I don't know if they're here to talk you into it or what, but answer any questions you may have about the OC Remix policy.

01:56:58.057 --> 01:57:00.159
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what, Loki, I think you're just going to have to do it.

01:57:01.644 --> 01:57:02.305
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't care.

01:57:02.425 --> 01:57:05.887
[SPEAKER_13]: I just don't think it's, you know, usually... You think you're not worthy.

01:57:05.967 --> 01:57:06.508
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that what it is?

01:57:07.349 --> 01:57:07.849
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess.

01:57:08.029 --> 01:57:10.491
[SPEAKER_14]: You've got all these listeners telling you you're worthy.

01:57:10.591 --> 01:57:11.152
[SPEAKER_14]: Just do it.

01:57:11.552 --> 01:57:11.952
[SPEAKER_14]: Do it!

01:57:11.992 --> 01:57:12.392
[SPEAKER_14]: Do it, Loki!

01:57:12.413 --> 01:57:12.813
[SPEAKER_14]: Do it!

01:57:12.853 --> 01:57:13.393
[SPEAKER_14]: Do it!

01:57:13.433 --> 01:57:14.194
[SPEAKER_18]: Do it!

01:57:14.274 --> 01:57:14.934
[SPEAKER_18]: Do it!

01:57:15.955 --> 01:57:16.516
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess.

01:57:17.156 --> 01:57:18.297
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the spirit.

01:57:18.317 --> 01:57:19.278
[SPEAKER_18]: Yay!

01:57:20.759 --> 01:57:21.019
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

01:57:21.860 --> 01:57:23.281
[SPEAKER_14]: So you guys can be looking forward to that.

01:57:25.042 --> 01:57:28.465
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it would be funny if we went through all that and then they say, oh, sorry, this sucks.

01:57:30.447 --> 01:57:30.807
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd laugh.

01:57:31.124 --> 01:57:34.566
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, it'll give us good material for next week's show, so I'm down for it.

01:57:36.668 --> 01:57:37.909
[SPEAKER_14]: Good luck to you, Loki.

01:57:37.929 --> 01:57:38.749
[SPEAKER_14]: I hope it works out for you.

01:57:38.769 --> 01:57:39.390
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that'll be fun.

01:57:40.170 --> 01:57:40.470
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

01:57:42.312 --> 01:57:44.473
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, John's going all the way to the top.

01:57:44.613 --> 01:57:45.014
[SPEAKER_14]: Look at that.

01:57:46.394 --> 01:57:47.355
[SPEAKER_14]: That guy's crazy.

01:57:47.675 --> 01:57:48.916
[SPEAKER_14]: That guy's your biggest fan.

01:57:49.417 --> 01:57:49.977
[SPEAKER_14]: Look at that.

01:57:50.857 --> 01:57:51.658
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki's turning red.

01:57:52.078 --> 01:57:53.499
[SPEAKER_18]: I better change the subject.

01:57:56.161 --> 01:57:56.641
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, Loki.

01:57:58.142 --> 01:58:00.104
[SPEAKER_13]: We gotta get to actual news now.

01:58:01.710 --> 01:58:04.591
[SPEAKER_13]: So we do all this fun stuff and then get back to some actual news.

01:58:05.331 --> 01:58:09.732
[SPEAKER_13]: The full unlock list for 2DX Red has been released, actually.

01:58:11.212 --> 01:58:15.113
[SPEAKER_13]: With some interesting information here, we've got all the hidden songs.

01:58:15.373 --> 01:58:30.196
[SPEAKER_13]: So we have, you know, Egea by Ryu, Blox by Sparker, The Hope of Tomorrow by Sota, Earthscape by DJ Taka, Ultimate by Terra, Fake Time by DJ Rimocon,

01:58:31.190 --> 01:58:38.234
[SPEAKER_13]: and Close My Eyes For Me by D.Crew featuring Dennis Gunn.

01:58:40.935 --> 01:58:43.596
[SPEAKER_14]: That's two letters off from being the name of my boss.

01:58:44.577 --> 01:58:46.578
[SPEAKER_14]: Seriously, that's scaring to me.

01:58:46.658 --> 01:58:47.078
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, sorry.

01:58:48.619 --> 01:58:54.262
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways, and also with Hidden and Others for Double A, Andromeda, and Gigadelic.

01:58:55.928 --> 01:59:08.581
[SPEAKER_14]: I told Navi, and if you're out there listening, Navi, you poppin' music whore friend of mine and 2DX whore part-time, I told you when you said that there were not a whole lot of anothers in 2DX Red, I said, they're probably hidden.

01:59:09.041 --> 01:59:11.003
[SPEAKER_14]: I told you so, I told you so, I told you so.

01:59:11.324 --> 01:59:11.584
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

01:59:13.368 --> 01:59:22.841
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways, also should mention, since it's sort of Bomani related, exclusively through BomaniStyle.com, they're going to be releasing Slake's new album.

01:59:23.602 --> 01:59:28.589
[SPEAKER_13]: And Slake, for those of you who might not know, is an old school Bomani artist.

01:59:30.157 --> 01:59:45.441
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of the titles for these songs here, Past, Oriental, Mechanist, The Fading of Light, Justified, Rush, I Am a Clone, and looks like Astro... I can't even pronounce that.

01:59:45.741 --> 01:59:47.182
[SPEAKER_13]: Astro-Oxy Remix.

01:59:48.522 --> 01:59:50.363
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways, and those should be coming soon.

01:59:50.383 --> 01:59:55.424
[SPEAKER_13]: They're doing some stupid little contests here where you get to design the cover and yadda yadda yadda.

01:59:55.544 --> 01:59:57.625
[SPEAKER_13]: So go to my cell, check it out.

02:00:00.236 --> 02:00:02.406
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's a little clip of Slake, if you're unfamiliar with Slake.

02:00:02.426 --> 02:00:04.796
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's a little clip of cloudy music from 7thstyle.

02:00:19.472 --> 02:00:22.673
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't know what exactly you would call Slake's style of music.

02:00:22.713 --> 02:00:27.434
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just, it's funky beats, I think would be a good way of putting, classifying Slake.

02:00:27.454 --> 02:00:28.634
[SPEAKER_14]: You can't really classify him.

02:00:28.674 --> 02:00:31.055
[SPEAKER_14]: He's a pretty fun guy.

02:00:33.196 --> 02:00:36.137
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, so, I don't know.

02:00:36.357 --> 02:00:36.737
[SPEAKER_13]: But anyways.

02:00:38.777 --> 02:00:41.019
[SPEAKER_13]: Huh, so I think that's pretty much all the news.

02:00:41.119 --> 02:00:43.321
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, Poppin's 12, something happened with that.

02:00:43.541 --> 02:00:43.862
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

02:00:43.882 --> 02:00:47.265
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a little piece of news I want to share going on.

02:00:47.405 --> 02:00:52.950
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, this was posted to our site by our very own news guy, Dark Tetsuya, who does a lot of the news for the site.

02:00:52.970 --> 02:00:55.452
[SPEAKER_14]: We really appreciate him helping out over at OrangeLaundry.com.

02:00:55.872 --> 02:01:04.060
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if you guys remember this, but way back in the beginnings of the show, I'm talking like two years ago, back in the first like 10, 20 episodes, you guys remember Twin Galaxies?

02:01:05.569 --> 02:01:08.010
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I noticed that that's back.

02:01:08.170 --> 02:01:14.192
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, Twin Galaxies, now they are the site that does all the high scores for games, video games.

02:01:14.232 --> 02:01:17.673
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not talking about just like new video games, I'm talking about old video games too.

02:01:17.714 --> 02:01:22.875
[SPEAKER_14]: We actually, probably the last time we brought them up on the show was during Classic Gaming Expo earlier this year.

02:01:22.955 --> 02:01:26.437
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember when we all participated in the Stampede Challenge?

02:01:26.697 --> 02:01:30.558
[SPEAKER_14]: Which, by the way, I never checked to see if the scores were on, because I, are they?

02:01:31.138 --> 02:01:32.139
[SPEAKER_13]: They were, and you did.

02:01:32.219 --> 02:01:32.439
[SPEAKER_13]: Check.

02:01:32.899 --> 02:01:34.619
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, okay, I don't remember.

02:01:35.680 --> 02:01:39.260
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to have to pull that up again, because I remember that I was in the bottom three.

02:01:39.300 --> 02:01:41.661
[SPEAKER_14]: I swear I did so horrible at Stampede.

02:01:41.841 --> 02:01:46.542
[SPEAKER_13]: I was somewhere in the teens for the rankings for Gradius V also.

02:01:47.462 --> 02:01:48.202
[SPEAKER_14]: Very, very nice.

02:01:48.422 --> 02:01:53.823
[SPEAKER_14]: How does that make your internet penis feel, to be in the top 20 Gradius V players, officially?

02:01:54.063 --> 02:01:56.804
[SPEAKER_13]: That's pretty sad, since I don't play Gradius.

02:01:57.084 --> 02:02:01.105
[SPEAKER_13]: That was the first time I'd ever played Gradius V. That's not saying much.

02:02:06.583 --> 02:02:08.186
[SPEAKER_14]: Twin Galaxies is back in the news.

02:02:08.406 --> 02:02:11.913
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently, a brand new record has been set.

02:02:13.703 --> 02:02:28.369
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm actually going to the link, which is a link actually to a post over on AaronInJapan.com And they actually, and if you want to see all this for yourself, it's all posted over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com They actually posted a story from Twin Galaxies, where apparently, what is the guy's name?

02:02:28.729 --> 02:02:32.090
[SPEAKER_14]: Gregory Cantor of Pennsylvania in the U.S.

02:02:32.130 --> 02:02:33.411
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, that's where I spent some time this year.

02:02:34.872 --> 02:02:38.454
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, funny enough, I didn't see any good DDR machines while I was out there.

02:02:38.534 --> 02:02:42.317
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently, I was checking all the wrong places, so it was my own damn fault.

02:02:42.537 --> 02:02:48.942
[SPEAKER_14]: This guy in Pennsylvania has just set the new record for DDR Extreme.

02:02:49.993 --> 02:02:54.495
[SPEAKER_14]: And basically the way the rules work, this is the way the official rules work for you to get ranked.

02:02:54.856 --> 02:02:57.037
[SPEAKER_14]: You have to be playing on easy, difficulty 3.

02:02:57.797 --> 02:02:59.058
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a 5 song set.

02:02:59.578 --> 02:03:01.159
[SPEAKER_14]: Game over has to be turned on.

02:03:01.779 --> 02:03:04.921
[SPEAKER_14]: You get to play your choice of songs, but you have to be on heavy mode.

02:03:05.281 --> 02:03:09.423
[SPEAKER_14]: The gamer is allowed to take as much time in between sets as the timer allows.

02:03:09.943 --> 02:03:13.445
[SPEAKER_14]: No song can be picked more than 2 times in the performance.

02:03:13.925 --> 02:03:16.266
[SPEAKER_14]: The selection and sequence of songs is the player's choice.

02:03:16.726 --> 02:03:19.166
[SPEAKER_14]: Player's hands may not touch the dance pad.

02:03:19.606 --> 02:03:20.406
[SPEAKER_14]: Bar's okay though.

02:03:20.827 --> 02:03:22.787
[SPEAKER_14]: Only the player's feet may touch the dance pad.

02:03:22.807 --> 02:03:23.887
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is how the guy did it.

02:03:24.187 --> 02:03:30.849
[SPEAKER_14]: He played Max 300, Max Unlimited, Sakura, Bag, Paranoia Rebirth.

02:03:30.909 --> 02:03:32.929
[SPEAKER_14]: So basically he played every 10-footer in the game.

02:03:33.269 --> 02:03:33.809
[SPEAKER_14]: Is Rebirth a 10?

02:03:34.230 --> 02:03:34.710
[SPEAKER_14]: Or is Rebirth a 9?

02:03:35.490 --> 02:03:37.450
[SPEAKER_14]: So he played... Are you sure?

02:03:38.490 --> 02:03:40.351
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, so he played four 10s and a 9.

02:03:42.409 --> 02:03:49.639
[SPEAKER_14]: And he ended up with a, what would they, actually, if you read on in the thread, they don't think it's Suguru, they think it's actually Sakura, not Suguru.

02:03:49.840 --> 02:03:52.604
[SPEAKER_14]: Which would make more sense anyway, for somebody to pick Sakura, because it's a 10.

02:03:53.084 --> 02:03:54.526
[SPEAKER_14]: So this guy got a score of 375,311,150 points.

02:03:57.711 --> 02:03:57.791
[SPEAKER_14]: YASU

02:04:13.388 --> 02:04:24.277
[SPEAKER_14]: If I'm not mistaking, didn't he, remember when we first brought this up on the show, it was some other guy who had a really, really low record, we were all making fun of how we were going to beat it, and then Yasu came in and kicked all our asses, basically.

02:04:24.718 --> 02:04:26.079
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's why this is such big news.

02:04:26.359 --> 02:04:32.084
[SPEAKER_14]: If, if, I recall, and I may be wrong, but, because maybe it's a Max 2 versus Extreme thing, I don't know.

02:04:32.364 --> 02:04:33.505
[SPEAKER_14]: You know any more about this, Loki?

02:04:34.666 --> 02:04:39.991
[SPEAKER_13]: That was Max 2, if I remember correctly, and the rules were different than, I think, the rules where you can't play a song more than twice.

02:04:41.119 --> 02:04:42.820
[SPEAKER_13]: in a row, or twice, I think.

02:04:43.301 --> 02:04:46.422
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I think he played Max Unlimited twice or something like that.

02:04:46.582 --> 02:04:46.883
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

02:04:47.403 --> 02:04:48.083
[SPEAKER_13]: It was stupid.

02:04:48.223 --> 02:04:49.504
[SPEAKER_13]: Twin Galaxies is stupid.

02:04:49.604 --> 02:04:50.325
[SPEAKER_13]: I really don't care.

02:04:52.186 --> 02:04:52.946
[SPEAKER_13]: That's my take on it.

02:04:56.568 --> 02:04:57.309
[SPEAKER_14]: Very interesting.

02:04:59.901 --> 02:05:05.484
[SPEAKER_14]: And now I'm getting a message in our chatroom over at www.orangelandredo.com from Dark Tetsuya.

02:05:06.044 --> 02:05:10.626
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, sorry guys, it was Take, not Yasu, that set the bar there, sorry.

02:05:11.126 --> 02:05:11.667
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what?

02:05:12.347 --> 02:05:18.370
[SPEAKER_14]: Both of them are insanely good at DDR, it's easy to get them confused because you always hear about them together.

02:05:18.410 --> 02:05:20.131
[SPEAKER_14]: You always hear about the two of them, so sorry about that.

02:05:20.331 --> 02:05:21.071
[SPEAKER_14]: My bad, my bad.

02:05:22.472 --> 02:05:27.014
[SPEAKER_14]: But Dark Tetsuya says, it seems like he may not have gotten parental permission.

02:05:28.667 --> 02:05:31.789
[SPEAKER_14]: I certainly didn't have parental permission when I played Stampede.

02:05:34.290 --> 02:05:35.991
[SPEAKER_14]: My mother doesn't know I do this garbage.

02:05:36.111 --> 02:05:36.472
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

02:05:36.832 --> 02:05:40.053
[SPEAKER_14]: You have to have parental permission to be on a high score list?

02:05:40.133 --> 02:05:42.034
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that what they're trying to say?

02:05:42.195 --> 02:05:43.915
[SPEAKER_02]: Something about child privacy law.

02:05:44.836 --> 02:05:45.436
[SPEAKER_14]: Jeez.

02:05:48.038 --> 02:05:48.698
[SPEAKER_14]: That's kind of lame.

02:05:49.458 --> 02:05:50.579
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, but I think that's lame.

02:05:52.475 --> 02:05:53.756
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, we're going to go to our break, guys.

02:05:53.776 --> 02:05:56.557
[SPEAKER_14]: So when we come back from this break, we're going to get into the FUs of the week.

02:05:57.177 --> 02:06:01.039
[SPEAKER_14]: Because we have to do that segment every week because we're just angsty.

02:06:01.059 --> 02:06:02.139
[SPEAKER_14]: We're angsty, angsty people.

02:06:02.620 --> 02:06:03.440
[SPEAKER_14]: And we have to get it out.

02:06:04.040 --> 02:06:07.142
[SPEAKER_14]: In this break, we're going to hear... I don't know.

02:06:07.162 --> 02:06:08.502
[SPEAKER_14]: What are you in the mood for, Jamie?

02:06:08.522 --> 02:06:10.243
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you want to hear this break?

02:06:10.863 --> 02:06:14.325
[SPEAKER_02]: How about Dance Maniac stuff?

02:06:14.685 --> 02:06:16.346
[SPEAKER_14]: Ooh, sounds like a plan to me.

02:06:16.446 --> 02:06:17.547
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's do some Dance Maniac songs.

02:06:17.567 --> 02:06:18.707
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Jay Paradise stuff.

02:06:19.367 --> 02:06:20.548
[SPEAKER_14]: If I can find some, we'll do that.

02:06:23.297 --> 02:06:23.517
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

02:06:24.877 --> 02:06:25.157
[SPEAKER_14]: Nothing.

02:06:25.577 --> 02:06:26.198
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

02:06:26.658 --> 02:06:28.438
[SPEAKER_02]: How about, okay, better yet.

02:06:29.438 --> 02:06:34.499
[SPEAKER_02]: I request... Hurry up.

02:06:34.559 --> 02:06:35.139
[SPEAKER_02]: Sensation.

02:06:36.339 --> 02:06:37.419
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, if I can find it.

02:06:37.679 --> 02:06:39.460
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

02:06:40.640 --> 02:06:41.100
[SPEAKER_02]: Twinbee.

02:06:42.240 --> 02:06:42.540
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

02:06:43.560 --> 02:06:46.161
[SPEAKER_02]: And Gradius Full Speed.

02:06:46.841 --> 02:06:47.961
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, we'll make that happen.

02:06:48.001 --> 02:06:52.422
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll be right back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

02:08:35.539 --> 02:08:36.902
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

02:09:08.018 --> 02:09:09.819
Thank you for watching!

02:11:33.667 --> 02:11:34.648
Thanks for watching!

02:11:58.191 --> 02:12:06.779
[SPEAKER_01]: Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.

02:12:06.819 --> 02:12:12.345
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

02:12:13.140 --> 02:12:16.123
[SPEAKER_14]: I saw the precious precious sitting back in the tech room today

02:12:34.261 --> 02:12:37.707
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a nice, pretty little 2DX machine missing the monitor because they're replacing it.

02:12:38.067 --> 02:12:41.112
[SPEAKER_14]: It's currently in 8th style, but who knows what it'll be when it's up and running.

02:12:41.493 --> 02:12:46.801
[SPEAKER_14]: I smooched it to tell it I love it, and yes, I humped it too, just like I did the Scandia 8th style when it first came in.

02:12:46.841 --> 02:12:47.963
[SPEAKER_14]: That's so good to know now.

02:12:49.963 --> 02:12:50.503
[SPEAKER_14]: So there it is.

02:12:50.883 --> 02:12:52.684
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got wifey poo humping on it.

02:12:53.404 --> 02:12:53.784
[SPEAKER_14]: Great.

02:12:53.844 --> 02:12:54.385
[SPEAKER_02]: That's happy.

02:12:54.425 --> 02:12:56.545
[SPEAKER_14]: Girl cooties on the 2DX machine.

02:12:57.526 --> 02:12:57.946
[SPEAKER_14]: Just kidding.

02:12:58.266 --> 02:12:59.427
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes it all the better.

02:13:00.987 --> 02:13:01.927
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's pretty exciting.

02:13:01.968 --> 02:13:02.388
[SPEAKER_14]: So there it is.

02:13:02.768 --> 02:13:05.389
[SPEAKER_14]: That's about as close to a confirmation as you can get.

02:13:05.469 --> 02:13:08.530
[SPEAKER_14]: When Iguana Girls humped it, you know it's the real deal.

02:13:10.111 --> 02:13:10.411
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

02:13:12.351 --> 02:13:16.333
[SPEAKER_14]: So anyway, moving right along, I guess we're going to get into the FUs of the week.

02:13:17.935 --> 02:13:19.136
[SPEAKER_14]: We're not going to take it anymore.

02:13:19.176 --> 02:13:19.496
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, this is bad.

02:13:51.287 --> 02:13:52.268
[SPEAKER_02]: A big F.U.

02:13:52.308 --> 02:13:55.851
[SPEAKER_02]: toward my overwhelming lack of free time the past week.

02:13:55.911 --> 02:14:01.436
[SPEAKER_02]: However, now that this semester is over and I have one thing left to do, it's great.

02:14:01.456 --> 02:14:08.883
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I just realized that the classes that I need to take next semester are full term, except for one that's going to be second half.

02:14:10.117 --> 02:14:12.982
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to be really freaking busy next semester.

02:14:15.005 --> 02:14:24.039
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to there being no time off allowed next month, but I might have to beg some anyway to take care of some school stuff.

02:14:26.992 --> 02:14:30.854
[SPEAKER_02]: Just an FU toward all the slow ass people on the road today.

02:14:31.295 --> 02:14:38.759
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, and an FU toward the guy who cut me off in traffic and then threw on his brakes on purpose.

02:14:38.779 --> 02:14:41.301
[SPEAKER_02]: Because he was tailgating me so I slowed down.

02:14:41.661 --> 02:14:46.143
[SPEAKER_02]: So he goes around me and then gets in front of me and tries to throw on his brakes so that I went into him.

02:14:46.524 --> 02:14:48.885
[SPEAKER_02]: Thing is, I drive a Tercel with bad brakes.

02:14:49.165 --> 02:14:49.625
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going 50.

02:14:50.646 --> 02:14:52.706
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that would have been, like, lethal.

02:14:53.046 --> 02:14:58.708
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I, luckily there was no one in the next instance, so I swerved around him, and it turns out that I ended up being, like, five cars ahead of him in traffic anyway.

02:14:59.288 --> 02:15:02.728
[SPEAKER_02]: So, he got stuck behind, like, some old people in a Buick.

02:15:04.729 --> 02:15:13.210
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, F you toward, uh, not having money, time, and certain things.

02:15:15.651 --> 02:15:17.511
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's really about it.

02:15:19.764 --> 02:15:24.787
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to point out for a minute, if any of the OC Remix people are listening, this is another one by Loki.

02:15:30.351 --> 02:15:31.091
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to get you.

02:15:31.111 --> 02:15:34.253
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to get you to whore yourself out.

02:15:34.293 --> 02:15:35.854
[SPEAKER_14]: If you won't do it, dammit, we will.

02:15:38.195 --> 02:15:39.816
[SPEAKER_14]: And on that note, let's go over to Loki.

02:15:43.459 --> 02:15:45.420
[SPEAKER_13]: Whatever, I don't even care anymore.

02:15:46.092 --> 02:15:48.094
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck you to my work for making me bake cookies.

02:15:48.474 --> 02:15:51.036
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't like extracurricular activities no matter what they are.

02:15:51.316 --> 02:15:52.457
[SPEAKER_13]: Even if it involves cookies.

02:15:52.537 --> 02:15:54.898
[SPEAKER_13]: Because the cookies I made, I don't like to eat.

02:15:55.239 --> 02:15:56.279
[SPEAKER_13]: One, because they taste like lemon.

02:15:56.320 --> 02:15:58.241
[SPEAKER_13]: Two, because they have nuts in them.

02:15:58.441 --> 02:15:59.462
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not my forte.

02:15:59.722 --> 02:16:00.022
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways.

02:16:01.243 --> 02:16:05.326
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, I guess fuck you, uh, CarMax for taking forever to fix my car.

02:16:05.426 --> 02:16:09.149
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't know, but I guess it takes two days to do a fucking brake job.

02:16:09.789 --> 02:16:10.990
[SPEAKER_13]: Whoa, what have I been doing?

02:16:11.010 --> 02:16:14.613
[SPEAKER_13]: I must have been doing it completely wrong because I get mine done in like an hour and a half.

02:16:15.182 --> 02:16:19.143
[SPEAKER_13]: The only problem is I didn't know I needed a brake job, because I didn't know what the fuck was wrong with my brake.

02:16:19.524 --> 02:16:38.570
[SPEAKER_13]: Come to find out, it was actually something when the person before me, or CarMax, who fucking knows, installed my brakes, they installed them incorrectly, so the retainer clip was broken, and thus the pad was wearing funny, causing a vibration noise, thus resulting in my brake being worn down on one side, not the other side, so I needed the front brake job.

02:16:39.111 --> 02:16:39.851
[SPEAKER_13]: But, unfortunately...

02:16:40.219 --> 02:16:42.480
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll have to do a front break job later, because I got done now.

02:16:42.840 --> 02:16:43.961
[SPEAKER_13]: So, good for that.

02:16:44.761 --> 02:16:54.546
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, and then finally, um, since I don't really have that many FUs this week, um, fuck you to, uh, let's see here.

02:16:55.086 --> 02:17:00.549
[SPEAKER_13]: I know it's coming here, coming, coming, um, no, I can't think of what it was.

02:17:01.110 --> 02:17:05.352
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, there's something that was really pissing me off the other day, but I just cannot remember what it is right now.

02:17:05.672 --> 02:17:05.792
[SPEAKER_13]: Um,

02:17:08.075 --> 02:17:09.516
[SPEAKER_13]: All things just keep getting better

02:17:36.591 --> 02:17:39.013
[SPEAKER_14]: F you to the fog, because fog is scary.

02:17:39.393 --> 02:17:42.116
[SPEAKER_14]: And I don't like driving in the fog, because it's very scary.

02:17:43.297 --> 02:17:43.497
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

02:17:43.737 --> 02:17:46.420
[SPEAKER_02]: We saw a six-car accident in the fog yesterday.

02:17:46.440 --> 02:17:48.222
[SPEAKER_02]: See, the fog is scary.

02:17:49.122 --> 02:17:52.866
[SPEAKER_14]: Fog is a cruel trick to be playing on us humans, so I say F you to fog.

02:17:53.446 --> 02:17:55.008
[SPEAKER_14]: And F you to angst.

02:17:58.451 --> 02:18:06.654
[SPEAKER_14]: and F you to the fact that I wasn't drinking last night even though for once I was the person that didn't have to drive so I could have drank all I wanted but I didn't because I'm a pussy.

02:18:07.495 --> 02:18:13.297
[SPEAKER_14]: And F you to complicated situations because I keep finding myself in them and I hate that.

02:18:15.398 --> 02:18:16.578
[SPEAKER_14]: Fair enough?

02:18:16.639 --> 02:18:18.879
[SPEAKER_18]: I was going to add something on the fog thing.

02:18:20.040 --> 02:18:20.240
[SPEAKER_14]: What?

02:18:20.260 --> 02:18:24.902
[SPEAKER_18]: A dude in a Mustang broke through one of our neighbor's fences.

02:18:26.138 --> 02:18:28.959
[SPEAKER_00]: F-Fog Actually, I do have to say one thing about Fog, if I may

02:18:51.289 --> 02:18:58.375
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, when I lived in Alabama, in college, at our dorms there was like this little grove of trees and it would get so foggy they would play hide and seek in the fog.

02:18:58.996 --> 02:18:59.536
[SPEAKER_02]: That, oh.

02:19:00.097 --> 02:19:00.777
[SPEAKER_02]: That was really cool.

02:19:00.877 --> 02:19:03.860
[SPEAKER_14]: I would be so afraid of getting raped by a zombie in the fog.

02:19:04.901 --> 02:19:06.883
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the days before Silent Hill.

02:19:07.243 --> 02:19:07.783
[SPEAKER_00]: Still!

02:19:08.644 --> 02:19:11.306
[SPEAKER_14]: Zombie raping has been around forever.

02:19:11.907 --> 02:19:15.190
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that would explain a few people who call where I work.

02:19:15.410 --> 02:19:15.770
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

02:19:16.851 --> 02:19:17.592
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's move on.

02:19:17.772 --> 02:19:18.713
[SPEAKER_14]: Angel, your FUs.

02:19:19.361 --> 02:19:25.706
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, yeah, I'll add another F you to the difficult situation thing, just because I hate that.

02:19:26.886 --> 02:19:33.671
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, F you to, um, yeah.

02:19:33.691 --> 02:19:37.774
[SPEAKER_18]: F you to a parent that wants to be there but never was to begin with.

02:19:38.275 --> 02:19:44.819
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not talking about my parents, I'm talking about my significant other's certain parents.

02:19:45.700 --> 02:19:47.221
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, and, uh, you know what?

02:19:47.970 --> 02:19:51.473
[SPEAKER_18]: They don't want you there, so stop trying, because you never tried anyway.

02:19:52.473 --> 02:19:53.934
[SPEAKER_18]: And, uh, that's it.

02:19:55.275 --> 02:19:55.576
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

02:19:56.756 --> 02:19:59.018
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's go on to the chatroom FUs, then.

02:20:00.259 --> 02:20:04.502
[SPEAKER_14]: Dork says, F you to myself for having a girl over and not doing anything about it.

02:20:06.484 --> 02:20:06.784
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, exactly.

02:20:06.804 --> 02:20:07.224
[SPEAKER_14]: What, Loki?

02:20:08.225 --> 02:20:08.865
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, exactly.

02:20:08.905 --> 02:20:11.207
[SPEAKER_13]: That stuff will kick you until the day you die.

02:20:11.507 --> 02:20:11.807
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay?

02:20:12.048 --> 02:20:15.070
[SPEAKER_13]: Just, you gotta remember, do it even if it seems wrong.

02:20:17.520 --> 02:20:18.501
[SPEAKER_14]: Get the zombies to help.

02:20:19.122 --> 02:20:32.680
[SPEAKER_14]: Dark Knight says, My FU goes to the greedy American cable company, sounding like an English-speaking Japanese guy, for trying to make you spend more money by removing HBO and Cinemax from basic and just putting on digital cable only now.

02:20:33.441 --> 02:20:33.642
[SPEAKER_14]: Hmm.

02:20:35.931 --> 02:20:42.900
[SPEAKER_14]: EvilMauki2DX says, F you to DarkLionXVI for pointing out that Noria has crooked teeth and needs braces.

02:20:43.321 --> 02:20:45.924
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll never be able to look at her the same ever again.

02:20:46.345 --> 02:20:48.107
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know how you didn't notice that before.

02:20:48.227 --> 02:20:48.668
[SPEAKER_14]: You're weird.

02:20:49.409 --> 02:20:52.192
[SPEAKER_14]: And one more F you to whatever caused the station drops earlier.

02:20:52.313 --> 02:20:52.753
[SPEAKER_14]: I agree.

02:20:52.833 --> 02:20:53.214
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

02:20:53.374 --> 02:20:53.835
[SPEAKER_14]: That was evil.

02:20:55.267 --> 02:21:00.828
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkLionXVI says, F you to Nathan Gale for killing metal guitar legend Dimebag Daryl.

02:21:01.928 --> 02:21:02.988
[SPEAKER_14]: Double amen to that.

02:21:03.348 --> 02:21:05.309
[SPEAKER_14]: And four other fans in Columbus, Ohio.

02:21:05.669 --> 02:21:07.669
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm glad the police officer killed the bastard.

02:21:07.729 --> 02:21:08.749
[SPEAKER_14]: Nathan, I hope you're comfortable.

02:21:08.789 --> 02:21:09.350
[SPEAKER_14]: Stay in hell.

02:21:09.730 --> 02:21:11.110
[SPEAKER_14]: Rest in peace, Dimebag Daryl.

02:21:11.670 --> 02:21:14.711
[SPEAKER_14]: We in the metal world will miss your red goatee and intense guitar riffs.

02:21:15.391 --> 02:21:20.932
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, and F you to EvilNauki2DX for torturing me with Nico Mimi Mode, the opening theme for...

02:21:22.745 --> 02:21:24.647
[SPEAKER_14]: You just had to do this to the white guy, didn't you?

02:21:25.067 --> 02:21:46.685
[SPEAKER_14]: Sukyomi Moonphase John Fields says, F you to the asshole who caused the pipe upstairs to burst My dorm room is flooded, oh you are sued, oh you are so sued You ruined my stuff and it's finals week F you to the school as well for not keeping the maintenance on the pipes in this dorm You're sued as well if there isn't any compensation coming to me

02:21:49.389 --> 02:21:55.712
[SPEAKER_14]: Illusion says, F you to waking up at 4.30 in the morning because of a nightmare of some weird guy strangling a woman with floss.

02:21:57.052 --> 02:21:59.593
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh well, it led to my new short story being written.

02:22:00.054 --> 02:22:03.375
[SPEAKER_14]: F you to this stupid character analysis paper for the Scarlet Letter due tomorrow.

02:22:03.655 --> 02:22:08.277
[SPEAKER_14]: And finally, a kind F you to DDR Angel for making that crappy bitch song win the cage match.

02:22:08.697 --> 02:22:10.718
[SPEAKER_14]: Sarah McLachlan was clearly the best song.

02:22:11.098 --> 02:22:12.999
[SPEAKER_14]: But it was a kind F you, DDR Angel.

02:22:14.560 --> 02:22:17.261
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't say anything because I don't know him, so whatever.

02:22:17.762 --> 02:22:20.363
[SPEAKER_18]: and besides, they left the decision up to me anyway.

02:22:20.383 --> 02:22:21.523
[SPEAKER_14]: That's right, you tell them.

02:22:25.285 --> 02:22:29.847
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, Misty says, F the movie theater that is one of only two in the group of machines in St.

02:22:29.887 --> 02:22:32.047
[SPEAKER_14]: Louis for not having the machine on tonight.

02:22:32.128 --> 02:22:34.228
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd rather play on shitty pads than not at all.

02:22:34.729 --> 02:22:39.010
[SPEAKER_14]: Nice to see you finally give a damn about the machine's maintenance though and of course, F the cage match.

02:22:39.870 --> 02:22:40.411
[SPEAKER_14]: You're welcome.

02:22:41.631 --> 02:22:46.353
[SPEAKER_14]: Jaded2004 says, F you to a broken rib which equals no DDR for a month.

02:22:48.154 --> 02:22:53.196
[SPEAKER_14]: Sigurd says, F you to a certain friend and his brother for not coming to terms with each of their sexuality.

02:22:53.577 --> 02:22:55.077
[SPEAKER_14]: They can make such a hot porn.

02:22:55.137 --> 02:22:55.498
[SPEAKER_14]: Grr.

02:22:56.378 --> 02:22:58.219
[SPEAKER_14]: F you to not having WarioWare DS.

02:22:58.559 --> 02:23:00.780
[SPEAKER_14]: Played my friend's copy and it's the best game ever.

02:23:01.040 --> 02:23:02.041
[SPEAKER_14]: Wait, when did that come out?

02:23:02.101 --> 02:23:03.561
[SPEAKER_14]: WarioWare DS is not out.

02:23:03.701 --> 02:23:03.962
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

02:23:04.342 --> 02:23:07.723
[SPEAKER_02]: Um... Not that I know of.

02:23:07.883 --> 02:23:08.764
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe in Japan?

02:23:09.224 --> 02:23:09.624
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe.

02:23:09.664 --> 02:23:10.845
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe in Japan.

02:23:10.885 --> 02:23:11.865
[SPEAKER_14]: Details, please.

02:23:14.006 --> 02:23:14.887
[SPEAKER_13]: It might be out in Japan.

02:23:15.782 --> 02:23:17.723
[SPEAKER_14]: Finally, F you to not getting enough sleep.

02:23:17.824 --> 02:23:19.205
[SPEAKER_14]: Damn you, Final Fantasy XI.

02:23:19.245 --> 02:23:20.826
[SPEAKER_14]: It's all your fault.

02:23:22.367 --> 02:23:23.187
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, moving on.

02:23:24.348 --> 02:23:25.109
[SPEAKER_14]: What, DarkSakura?

02:23:25.729 --> 02:23:26.530
[SPEAKER_14]: I smell vanilla.

02:23:27.651 --> 02:23:29.092
[SPEAKER_02]: All of a sudden, I smell vanilla.

02:23:30.873 --> 02:23:34.055
[SPEAKER_14]: Blarg says F you to people who keep saying they're bored all the time.

02:23:34.115 --> 02:23:36.237
[SPEAKER_14]: It pisses off people who don't have time to do anything.

02:23:36.597 --> 02:23:40.340
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're bored, go read some books and stop telling everyone you have nothing to do.

02:23:44.728 --> 02:23:48.313
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, they said in the chat room it's the Japanese version of WarioWare DS.

02:23:48.894 --> 02:23:49.975
[SPEAKER_14]: Just confirmation there.

02:23:52.358 --> 02:23:54.461
[SPEAKER_14]: And DarkTetsuya says, F you to my dance pad.

02:23:54.501 --> 02:23:58.487
[SPEAKER_14]: It might be broken, so I'm having a harder time passing Mission 19 on Extreme US.

02:23:59.147 --> 02:23:59.288
[SPEAKER_14]: Dope.

02:24:00.342 --> 02:24:03.545
[SPEAKER_14]: Legend of Zaku says, F you to having to go through the hell called finals week.

02:24:03.705 --> 02:24:07.488
[SPEAKER_14]: F you to lacking the basic skills of Java programming when I really need them.

02:24:09.049 --> 02:24:22.761
[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh, Rayum, I hope I said that, I hope, yeah, because if it was Ryum it would be an I, so Rayum says, F you to all the freaking extra hours that I have to put in before January 1st to compensate for the hours I put for my master's class.

02:24:23.241 --> 02:24:25.283
[SPEAKER_14]: Extra work hours, that means, sorry.

02:24:26.661 --> 02:24:28.562
[SPEAKER_14]: and Jazz says, F you to Saturday.

02:24:28.622 --> 02:24:30.222
[SPEAKER_14]: Holy crap, what a horrible day you were.

02:24:30.322 --> 02:24:36.724
[SPEAKER_14]: I had my first online final at 9 o'clock in the morning, so I got up early and went to school around 7 so I could get food and study.

02:24:37.065 --> 02:24:40.306
[SPEAKER_14]: During this process, I locked my keys in my car and need to call AAA.

02:24:40.666 --> 02:24:43.567
[SPEAKER_14]: I would have just called my parents, but they were conveniently in Reno for the weekend.

02:24:43.947 --> 02:24:49.409
[SPEAKER_14]: After that, I completely botched my final and proceeded to go home and drown my sorrows in sleep in World of Warcraft.

02:24:50.989 --> 02:24:52.410
[SPEAKER_14]: And after that, it got cut off, but...

02:24:53.427 --> 02:24:56.049
[SPEAKER_14]: If it has to do with World of Warcraft, I don't want to hear about it anyway.

02:24:56.629 --> 02:24:57.950
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm a little bitter towards that game.

02:24:58.210 --> 02:24:59.051
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sure it's a great game.

02:24:59.091 --> 02:25:00.052
[SPEAKER_14]: I've heard a lot of good things about it.

02:25:00.072 --> 02:25:01.253
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just a little bitter about it, that's all.

02:25:03.534 --> 02:25:04.135
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, that's it.

02:25:04.795 --> 02:25:06.076
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking at the Nevada girl.

02:25:06.657 --> 02:25:10.359
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is the link you had me post in the chat room earlier during the last podcast.

02:25:10.459 --> 02:25:17.684
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's an 11-year-old that killed a 12-year-old in her class in Japan, and now she's like an internet celebrity.

02:25:19.626 --> 02:25:21.127
[SPEAKER_02]: And they call her the Nevada girl.

02:25:21.327 --> 02:25:22.348
[SPEAKER_14]: I've heard of this girl.

02:25:23.055 --> 02:25:25.117
[SPEAKER_02]: or sometimes Tan-chan, I guess.

02:25:25.357 --> 02:25:26.118
[SPEAKER_14]: What happened to her?

02:25:26.758 --> 02:25:33.104
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they can't really do anything to her because the age of criminal responsibility in Japan is 14, which actually was lowered from 16.

02:25:34.048 --> 02:25:36.170
[SPEAKER_14]: Wait, so when you kill somebody and you're 11?

02:25:36.350 --> 02:25:38.992
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're under 14, you can't be prosecuted.

02:25:39.012 --> 02:25:42.075
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're still trying to decide what to do with her.

02:25:44.977 --> 02:25:49.781
[SPEAKER_02]: But apparently she's a big internet celebrity now in Japan and there's all kinds of fan art about her.

02:25:51.943 --> 02:25:55.786
[SPEAKER_02]: I did post the links in my live journal including a bunch of the fan art.

02:25:57.047 --> 02:26:13.221
[SPEAKER_02]: This site, and if someone will just retype this for me, it's www.shrinemaden.com slash, and it's all in caps, Nevada underscore, and then capital A, the rest is lowercase, RTWORK.

02:26:13.862 --> 02:26:14.783
[SPEAKER_14]: I lost you, sorry.

02:26:16.827 --> 02:26:33.474
[SPEAKER_02]: www.shrinemaden.com, Nevada is all capitalized, underscore, Nevada, okay, underscore, and then artwork, capital A, the rest is lowercase.

02:26:34.354 --> 02:26:34.854
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the site.

02:26:34.914 --> 02:26:35.694
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it?

02:26:35.714 --> 02:26:36.435
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all the fan art.

02:26:39.316 --> 02:26:41.517
[SPEAKER_14]: There it is, in the chat room, just for you guys.

02:26:46.245 --> 02:26:48.526
[SPEAKER_14]: Some suggestions from the chatroom.

02:26:48.566 --> 02:26:50.927
[SPEAKER_14]: Dark Knight says, here's a suggestion, send her to her shrink.

02:26:51.947 --> 02:26:54.107
[SPEAKER_14]: Ram says the girl needs counseling big time.

02:26:56.068 --> 02:26:56.508
[SPEAKER_14]: There you go.

02:26:58.028 --> 02:26:59.569
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently she killed her with a box cutter.

02:27:01.289 --> 02:27:03.290
[SPEAKER_14]: Hope you have a pleasant Sunday night, everybody.

02:27:04.190 --> 02:27:07.491
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just find it funny that there's all kinds, like, look at one of these, Rob.

02:27:08.365 --> 02:27:09.106
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I'm looking.

02:27:09.926 --> 02:27:10.086
What?

02:27:10.647 --> 02:27:13.049
[SPEAKER_14]: She looks so sweet and innocent.

02:27:13.089 --> 02:27:14.930
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I'm gonna hold up my laptop to the thing.

02:27:15.471 --> 02:27:20.014
[SPEAKER_14]: She looks sweet and innocent and chibi in that picture, and she's holding a little box cutter behind her back.

02:27:20.074 --> 02:27:22.116
[SPEAKER_14]: That is, that's disturbing!

02:27:22.816 --> 02:27:24.518
[SPEAKER_14]: That is downright scary!

02:27:24.538 --> 02:27:25.999
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh my god.

02:27:26.039 --> 02:27:27.160
[SPEAKER_14]: Ugh.

02:27:28.561 --> 02:27:30.222
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, why do you find that so damn funny?

02:27:31.443 --> 02:27:33.845
[SPEAKER_13]: Because she has a box cutter and she killed a kid.

02:27:35.086 --> 02:27:36.287
[SPEAKER_13]: And now she's a fan.

02:27:37.867 --> 02:27:45.992
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, well, at least she's not like the ugly red-headed kid that killed some stupid kid and proposed his body in like, uh, he was on, uh, 48 hours last night.

02:27:47.533 --> 02:27:49.034
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, it's up on the webcam now.

02:27:52.256 --> 02:27:58.559
[SPEAKER_14]: And the webcam, of course, is available over at www.orangeloungeradio.com And people are going to see my UberLeak Precious.

02:27:59.300 --> 02:27:59.780
[SPEAKER_02]: My laptop.

02:28:01.601 --> 02:28:05.264
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, uh, we're going to go to a break and when we come back, why don't we do some Ask Orange Lounge?

02:28:05.284 --> 02:28:05.804
[SPEAKER_14]: How's that sound?

02:28:07.299 --> 02:28:08.820
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we call you Rapcon?

02:30:00.908 --> 02:30:02.790
Look around, look at what you see

02:32:00.993 --> 02:32:02.174
Thanks for watching!

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:29.540
Thanks for watching!

02:33:37.270 --> 02:33:38.531
[SPEAKER_14]: Orange Lounge Radio.

02:33:38.851 --> 02:33:41.013
[SPEAKER_14]: We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.

02:33:46.457 --> 02:33:47.918
[SPEAKER_14]: My god, you people are scary.

02:33:48.198 --> 02:33:50.920
[SPEAKER_14]: Looking at that cosplay and doujinshi.

02:33:50.960 --> 02:33:52.641
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to cosplay her at Faname.

02:33:53.602 --> 02:33:55.083
[SPEAKER_14]: She's 11 years old.

02:33:56.123 --> 02:33:59.366
[SPEAKER_14]: What's this talk of cartoon vagina in the chatroom?

02:33:59.606 --> 02:34:02.548
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the pictures are of the more hentai nature.

02:34:02.908 --> 02:34:03.428
[SPEAKER_02]: Gross!

02:34:03.468 --> 02:34:03.689
[SPEAKER_02]: But...

02:34:04.622 --> 02:34:07.524
[SPEAKER_14]: God, as if I didn't have reason enough to be gay.

02:34:07.724 --> 02:34:08.485
[SPEAKER_14]: Honestly, people.

02:34:09.005 --> 02:34:14.109
[SPEAKER_02]: But some of the pictures are just so adorable, and it's so wrong that there's this whole fandom.

02:34:14.149 --> 02:34:16.790
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the hentai one.

02:34:16.990 --> 02:34:19.392
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm planning on cosplaying in Mockery of the Fandom.

02:34:19.952 --> 02:34:20.233
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

02:34:21.514 --> 02:34:21.874
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure.

02:34:23.095 --> 02:34:24.756
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just got an email from Middyhead.

02:34:24.776 --> 02:34:29.019
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently his broadcast went pretty good, but he didn't get a chance to record it.

02:34:29.399 --> 02:34:31.660
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess he was having technical difficulties right up until the last minute.

02:34:31.921 --> 02:34:33.642
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, just like this show, what do you know?

02:34:35.049 --> 02:34:36.329
[SPEAKER_14]: Ask Orange Lounge Ask Orange Lounge

02:35:10.732 --> 02:35:13.674
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

02:35:14.194 --> 02:35:17.416
[SPEAKER_14]: What will we find out tonight on Orange Lounge Radio?

02:35:18.217 --> 02:35:25.541
[SPEAKER_14]: All I know is that I hope that the station doesn't disconnect, because if it does, then we won't be having this segment again tonight.

02:35:32.725 --> 02:35:35.107
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, there's a picture of her as one of the Battle Royale girls.

02:35:36.405 --> 02:35:46.869
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, and Jazz is the first question tonight, and he's basically asking the same thing we were just talking about, saying, Why is there a Nevada vagina action?

02:35:47.629 --> 02:35:50.370
[SPEAKER_14]: And am I bad for laughing at this?

02:35:52.751 --> 02:35:58.613
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's a little picture of the girl done in ASCII art that you could use in your signature on a forum if you wanted to.

02:35:59.194 --> 02:36:03.775
[SPEAKER_14]: I could copy and paste that in IRC if I was feeling dumb, but I'm not going to, so...

02:36:05.661 --> 02:36:05.881
[SPEAKER_14]: Ask Yes

02:36:24.605 --> 02:36:25.206
[SPEAKER_14]: Moving on.

02:36:25.886 --> 02:36:26.347
[SPEAKER_14]: Dork!

02:36:26.867 --> 02:36:30.931
[SPEAKER_14]: Dork wants to know, where do you buy anime t-shirts online?

02:36:31.631 --> 02:36:32.872
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know because I don't buy any.

02:36:33.193 --> 02:36:37.917
[SPEAKER_14]: If I'm going to buy Japanese-inspired t-shirts, I'm going to be shopping at English.com.

02:36:38.777 --> 02:36:40.959
[SPEAKER_14]: But I don't know about the anime shirts.

02:36:41.200 --> 02:36:42.060
[SPEAKER_14]: Any ideas, Jamie?

02:36:44.462 --> 02:36:45.223
[SPEAKER_14]: That's disgusting.

02:36:45.283 --> 02:36:47.525
[SPEAKER_14]: Jamie, any ideas about the anime shirts?

02:36:47.665 --> 02:36:47.945
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no.

02:36:48.626 --> 02:36:49.447
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to San Francisco.

02:36:50.147 --> 02:36:50.568
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki?

02:36:53.383 --> 02:36:55.985
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, you might try, depends on what you're looking for.

02:36:56.005 --> 02:37:10.513
[SPEAKER_13]: If you're looking for, um, I guess it would depend on what series you're looking for, because a lot of the film companies like ADV and stuff, they put out t-shirts along with their DVDs and stuff, so a site where you'd buy them, you'd probably be able to get the t-shirts from.

02:37:10.634 --> 02:37:16.177
[SPEAKER_13]: I've tried maybe RightStuff.com, and I think that's stuff with one F, and, um,

02:37:18.263 --> 02:37:19.204
[SPEAKER_13]: I think you might try there.

02:37:19.444 --> 02:37:22.146
[SPEAKER_13]: And just do fucking Google search, anime t-shirts.

02:37:22.186 --> 02:37:23.467
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sure you'll pull that shit up.

02:37:25.249 --> 02:37:25.529
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

02:37:27.931 --> 02:37:29.953
[SPEAKER_14]: You did not just say there's a Bukkake picture.

02:37:31.174 --> 02:37:32.194
[SPEAKER_14]: That is disgusting.

02:37:32.254 --> 02:37:32.715
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me see it.

02:37:33.135 --> 02:37:33.896
[SPEAKER_14]: I have to see it now.

02:37:36.398 --> 02:37:37.979
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh my god, I'm gonna die.

02:37:37.999 --> 02:37:40.461
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, Misty has a question.

02:37:42.162 --> 02:37:44.825
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my god, that's disgusting!

02:37:51.175 --> 02:37:52.196
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm done with this show.

02:37:52.256 --> 02:37:55.938
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm so done.

02:37:56.258 --> 02:37:58.659
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate to say it, but some of them are just pretty funny.

02:37:59.860 --> 02:38:01.360
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, simmer down for a minute.

02:38:01.421 --> 02:38:02.781
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's listen to Misty's question.

02:38:04.102 --> 02:38:05.583
[SPEAKER_14]: You okay over there, DarkSakura?

02:38:07.304 --> 02:38:08.424
[SPEAKER_14]: You of all people.

02:38:09.505 --> 02:38:10.966
[SPEAKER_14]: You are supposed to be a good girl.

02:38:11.366 --> 02:38:11.926
[SPEAKER_05]: Bullshit.

02:38:15.137 --> 02:38:15.978
[SPEAKER_14]: Misty has a question.

02:38:16.018 --> 02:38:22.322
[SPEAKER_14]: Misty's question is, what is the first... Stop for a minute.

02:38:23.102 --> 02:38:24.523
[SPEAKER_14]: Stop with the South Park, Nevada.

02:38:24.543 --> 02:38:25.844
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, listen to Misty's question.

02:38:26.525 --> 02:38:27.125
[SPEAKER_14]: Respect.

02:38:28.526 --> 02:38:29.006
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that?

02:38:29.046 --> 02:38:31.788
[SPEAKER_14]: What is the first Konami game that you remember playing?

02:38:31.888 --> 02:38:33.709
[SPEAKER_14]: It doesn't matter if it's arcade or console.

02:38:33.749 --> 02:38:35.130
[SPEAKER_14]: Hell, give both if you remember.

02:38:37.192 --> 02:38:38.312
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably Castlevania.

02:38:38.973 --> 02:38:40.133
[SPEAKER_14]: Castlevania was my first.

02:38:40.213 --> 02:38:40.994
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Twin Beasts.

02:38:41.174 --> 02:38:43.856
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, as it was on the NES, Stinger.

02:38:44.525 --> 02:38:45.425
[SPEAKER_14]: Mmm, Stinger.

02:38:45.806 --> 02:38:50.308
[SPEAKER_14]: I vividly remember getting Castlevania for like my birthday or something for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

02:38:50.348 --> 02:38:51.508
[SPEAKER_14]: That was the first Konami game I had.

02:38:51.849 --> 02:38:52.309
[SPEAKER_14]: You remember?

02:38:52.329 --> 02:38:58.092
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if you remember this, but on the 8-bit Nintendo, the Konami games came in a unique sort of packaging.

02:38:58.412 --> 02:39:01.893
[SPEAKER_14]: Sort of like the old Activision cartridges and the Atari 2600, they all looked the same.

02:39:02.214 --> 02:39:03.814
[SPEAKER_14]: So did the Konami, they were all grey.

02:39:03.874 --> 02:39:04.415
[SPEAKER_14]: You remember that?

02:39:04.435 --> 02:39:05.475
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

02:39:05.915 --> 02:39:08.677
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I remember Castlevania was the first of those games that I owned.

02:39:08.997 --> 02:39:09.217
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, Angel.

02:39:09.237 --> 02:39:09.417
[SPEAKER_14]: Angel.

02:39:10.046 --> 02:39:16.562
[SPEAKER_18]: The only one I remember, I know this is going to sound completely lame because it's one of the later games, but Contra.

02:39:17.671 --> 02:39:21.932
[SPEAKER_14]: I used to play the hell out of Contra I remember playing Contra on one of those ones My first game was Lifeforce

02:39:47.067 --> 02:40:01.522
[SPEAKER_13]: That was one of the first three games I had on Nintendo because I got Breakthrough, Zelda, and I think Lifeforce were the first three games I had on Nintendo.

02:40:01.542 --> 02:40:04.225
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, we know Lifeforce also as Salamander.

02:40:04.325 --> 02:40:07.008
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I know, but this was Lifeforce, not Salamander.

02:40:09.272 --> 02:40:18.401
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just like how what got me into DDR were the games Bust a Groove, and I know it's Bust a Move in Japan, but when I played it, it was Bust a Groove.

02:40:18.461 --> 02:40:24.947
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't even know there was an import scene until I got into this DDR stuff, so I guess that's one way you could put it.

02:40:25.367 --> 02:40:27.529
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know Jamie loves it when I call it Bust a Groove.

02:40:28.670 --> 02:40:30.412
[SPEAKER_14]: Bust a Groove, Bust a Groove, Bust a Groove!

02:40:31.433 --> 02:40:32.254
[SPEAKER_14]: I just got the finger.

02:40:32.674 --> 02:40:34.336
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, Blarg has a question.

02:40:40.560 --> 02:40:46.904
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not sure if this has been asked before, but would any of you participate in some bukkake action if given the chance?

02:40:47.124 --> 02:40:47.464
[SPEAKER_14]: P.S.

02:40:47.504 --> 02:40:48.165
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not offering.

02:40:48.305 --> 02:40:48.505
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

02:40:49.846 --> 02:40:51.067
[SPEAKER_14]: How do you know we haven't already?

02:40:53.889 --> 02:40:54.549
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think so.

02:40:55.970 --> 02:40:58.912
[SPEAKER_14]: Unless it's like cake frosting bukkake or something.

02:40:59.452 --> 02:41:00.813
[SPEAKER_14]: Because cake frosting is yummy.

02:41:01.274 --> 02:41:02.334
[SPEAKER_14]: As opposed, yes?

02:41:02.795 --> 02:41:03.215
[SPEAKER_18]: Sushi.

02:41:05.516 --> 02:41:06.137
[SPEAKER_18]: What the hell?

02:41:06.818 --> 02:41:08.279
[SPEAKER_18]: You don't remember the sushi?

02:41:08.379 --> 02:41:08.700
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

02:41:08.760 --> 02:41:09.260
[SPEAKER_18]: Down there?

02:41:09.280 --> 02:41:10.041
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember.

02:41:10.061 --> 02:41:10.481
[SPEAKER_14]: Over there?

02:41:10.881 --> 02:41:11.602
[SPEAKER_18]: Down the street?

02:41:11.822 --> 02:41:12.443
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember.

02:41:13.063 --> 02:41:13.744
[SPEAKER_14]: That's disgusting.

02:41:13.764 --> 02:41:14.925
[SPEAKER_18]: You're the one that mentioned it, too.

02:41:18.263 --> 02:41:20.304
[SPEAKER_14]: Our listeners have way too much free time on their hands.

02:41:20.324 --> 02:41:22.565
[SPEAKER_14]: You need to go read a book or something.

02:41:22.645 --> 02:41:23.706
[SPEAKER_14]: Take the other guy's advice.

02:41:24.166 --> 02:41:24.506
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

02:41:25.167 --> 02:41:26.508
[SPEAKER_14]: John Fields has a question.

02:41:26.868 --> 02:41:37.854
[SPEAKER_14]: If you had your choice of getting sucked inside your TV and ending up inside of a video game, non-bomani and non-porn, Loki, no bubble bath babes for you, what game would it be?

02:41:39.075 --> 02:41:39.915
[SPEAKER_14]: What game would it be?

02:41:41.376 --> 02:41:45.258
[SPEAKER_14]: If you had to get sucked into your TV into a video game, any thoughts?

02:41:45.882 --> 02:41:46.722
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a weird question.

02:41:46.742 --> 02:41:47.983
[SPEAKER_14]: This is such a nerd question.

02:41:49.183 --> 02:41:51.144
[SPEAKER_14]: This is funny.

02:41:51.304 --> 02:41:51.545
[SPEAKER_14]: Angel.

02:41:52.345 --> 02:41:53.445
[SPEAKER_18]: Why do I have to go first?

02:41:53.465 --> 02:41:54.286
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I'm making you.

02:41:55.206 --> 02:41:56.907
[SPEAKER_14]: Jamie, are you going to participate in tonight's show?

02:41:57.267 --> 02:41:58.508
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, this is funny.

02:41:58.648 --> 02:42:01.229
[SPEAKER_14]: If you had to get sucked into any video game, what would it be?

02:42:04.390 --> 02:42:05.771
[SPEAKER_02]: Sucked into any video game?

02:42:06.291 --> 02:42:07.512
[SPEAKER_14]: Non-bomani, non-porn.

02:42:09.373 --> 02:42:12.394
[SPEAKER_14]: This is one of the top three nerdiest questions I think we've ever gotten.

02:42:13.354 --> 02:42:14.655
[SPEAKER_02]: I honestly couldn't say.

02:42:19.978 --> 02:42:23.240
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably Puyo Puyo.

02:42:23.841 --> 02:42:28.163
[SPEAKER_02]: Wouldn't it be cool just to walk along through the forest and solve all your problems by having a friendly puzzle game?

02:42:32.674 --> 02:42:38.217
[SPEAKER_18]: I was going to say Mr. Driller just because it's the game I can't stop playing right now, but that just doesn't sound right.

02:42:38.237 --> 02:42:42.199
[SPEAKER_14]: You'd be drilling all day long and then you'd suffocate and fly away like a little angel.

02:42:42.219 --> 02:42:44.960
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm good at suffocating if you've ever watched me play.

02:42:45.961 --> 02:42:46.341
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki.

02:42:52.424 --> 02:42:58.387
[SPEAKER_13]: I would have to say... That just put me in Rumble Roses because...

02:43:01.573 --> 02:43:30.236
[SPEAKER_13]: non-porn that's not porn fuck that shit that ain't porn Grand Theft Auto that ain't fun you'd be perfect for Grand Theft Auto no, that's too much work I'd do either Mario or Zelda because I'd have to beat all the characters' pansy asses because they're lame I'm going to defeat you with oh no, turtles are going to kill me I'd be like, fuck that shit

02:43:30.677 --> 02:43:31.018
[SPEAKER_13]: Marvel Madness

02:43:43.735 --> 02:43:45.116
[SPEAKER_14]: You just slide down the hill.

02:43:45.437 --> 02:43:48.520
[SPEAKER_14]: Whee!

02:43:49.921 --> 02:43:52.704
[SPEAKER_14]: I would have to say BurgerTime, because hamburgers are yummy.

02:43:52.744 --> 02:43:53.786
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

02:43:53.826 --> 02:43:56.428
[SPEAKER_14]: Dartitsu, you said that in the chat room, so I had to say that.

02:43:56.809 --> 02:43:58.751
[SPEAKER_14]: No, actually, I already had some answers thought of.

02:43:59.231 --> 02:43:59.912
[SPEAKER_14]: Legend of Zelda.

02:44:00.252 --> 02:44:00.693
[SPEAKER_10]: Yay!

02:44:00.733 --> 02:44:02.515
[SPEAKER_14]: Because that was just such a cute game.

02:44:03.215 --> 02:44:13.519
[SPEAKER_14]: or I would have to say Pokemon, because very similar to Jamie, what if we could just settle our scores by having our pets do battle instead of us, you know, just have our pets.

02:44:13.539 --> 02:44:15.940
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie would sit on whatever pet you had and win.

02:44:18.448 --> 02:44:21.089
[SPEAKER_02]: Or... It sure means, like, Snorax, or whatever it was called.

02:44:21.489 --> 02:44:23.009
[SPEAKER_14]: Or... Final Fantasy IV.

02:44:23.549 --> 02:44:25.209
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I just have so many good memories about that game.

02:44:25.409 --> 02:44:28.730
[SPEAKER_14]: And I... I practically did live that game, back when I was a kid.

02:44:29.090 --> 02:44:31.331
[SPEAKER_14]: When I was a kid, I did live that game, okay?

02:44:31.431 --> 02:44:31.991
[SPEAKER_14]: So, what can I say?

02:44:32.011 --> 02:44:33.091
[SPEAKER_18]: I just thought of another good one.

02:44:33.311 --> 02:44:33.491
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

02:44:33.711 --> 02:44:34.491
[SPEAKER_18]: From the old school.

02:44:35.111 --> 02:44:35.732
[SPEAKER_18]: Kid Icarus.

02:44:36.732 --> 02:44:40.433
[SPEAKER_18]: Or Icarus, or whatever the hell you wanna... However the heck you wanna pronounce it.

02:44:40.553 --> 02:44:40.833
[SPEAKER_18]: You know.

02:44:41.333 --> 02:44:41.893
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that was a good one.

02:44:42.293 --> 02:44:44.253
[SPEAKER_14]: Even the... I like some of the answers the chatroom's giving.

02:44:44.313 --> 02:44:46.514
[SPEAKER_14]: Even Naoki2DX says, I'd be in Katamari Damashii.

02:44:47.314 --> 02:44:47.434
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh!

02:44:48.652 --> 02:44:49.593
[SPEAKER_14]: Leisure Suit Larry.

02:44:53.775 --> 02:44:56.536
[SPEAKER_13]: Or BMX Triple X. Nah, BMX Triple X is too much work.

02:44:56.736 --> 02:44:57.377
[SPEAKER_13]: Leisure Suit Larry.

02:45:00.919 --> 02:45:05.261
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkLionXVI says, what do you think of my Dancer video I linked you last week?

02:45:05.321 --> 02:45:07.082
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, it was Dancer.

02:45:07.142 --> 02:45:07.843
[SPEAKER_14]: I love Dancer.

02:45:07.983 --> 02:45:08.523
[SPEAKER_14]: What can I say?

02:45:08.583 --> 02:45:09.804
[SPEAKER_14]: Dancer is fabulous.

02:45:11.745 --> 02:45:12.805
[SPEAKER_14]: I highly recommend Dancer.

02:45:13.085 --> 02:45:14.786
[SPEAKER_14]: You should go ahead and post the link in our chat.

02:45:14.806 --> 02:45:17.548
[SPEAKER_14]: Let the chat people see it so that they can know what I'm talking about.

02:45:19.301 --> 02:45:23.864
[SPEAKER_14]: What's the best way to make two brothers have sex and stay somewhat hidden with your video camera?

02:45:23.884 --> 02:45:24.365
[SPEAKER_14]: Drugs, lots of drugs.

02:45:46.397 --> 02:45:51.579
[SPEAKER_14]: Seriously, if you had them do enough ecstasy and alcohol, they would not be able to even see you there in the corner.

02:45:51.599 --> 02:45:53.179
[SPEAKER_14]: You'd just be another fixture.

02:45:53.199 --> 02:45:56.801
[SPEAKER_14]: You know like in cartoons when they're trying to disguise themselves?

02:45:57.621 --> 02:45:58.801
[SPEAKER_13]: You'd probably be able to join in.

02:45:59.602 --> 02:46:02.163
[SPEAKER_14]: You know how you could disguise yourself as a palm tree?

02:46:02.803 --> 02:46:03.703
[SPEAKER_14]: Or as a lamp?

02:46:03.743 --> 02:46:06.484
[SPEAKER_14]: No, this was just on Drawn Together a couple weeks ago.

02:46:06.744 --> 02:46:09.885
[SPEAKER_14]: You could disguise yourself as a lamp by just putting a lampshade on your head.

02:46:10.566 --> 02:46:12.826
[SPEAKER_14]: So you could do that and then have your video camera there.

02:46:13.987 --> 02:46:14.647
[SPEAKER_14]: And you're just a lamp.

02:46:19.059 --> 02:46:20.019
[SPEAKER_14]: You guys are sick.

02:46:22.520 --> 02:46:24.761
[SPEAKER_14]: Illusion has an Orange Lounge Radio question.

02:46:27.121 --> 02:46:33.183
[SPEAKER_14]: If you drop a kitty in a blender and you shuffle cards at the same time, what are you guys doing for New Year's Eve?

02:46:42.926 --> 02:46:45.467
[SPEAKER_14]: I think there's only one part of that question you needed to hear.

02:46:45.527 --> 02:46:45.787
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki.

02:46:47.230 --> 02:46:50.331
[SPEAKER_13]: Easy, that's what I'm doing for New Year's.

02:46:50.631 --> 02:46:52.692
[SPEAKER_13]: Dropping a kitty in a blender and shuffling cards.

02:46:54.212 --> 02:46:55.813
[SPEAKER_13]: It's kitty smoothie and poker.

02:47:00.754 --> 02:47:03.695
[SPEAKER_14]: Jamie, do you have a serious answer for this poor question?

02:47:04.536 --> 02:47:06.776
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be heavily intoxicated.

02:47:07.236 --> 02:47:12.138
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, whatever I do, there will be drinking involved and hopefully sex if I get my way.

02:47:13.680 --> 02:47:16.662
[SPEAKER_14]: Just not with two brothers, because I'm not into that.

02:47:18.163 --> 02:47:19.123
[SPEAKER_14]: Angel, you thinking over there?

02:47:19.183 --> 02:47:20.704
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you have a plot, a plan?

02:47:23.026 --> 02:47:28.129
[SPEAKER_18]: Not for the kitty questions, like whatever, but... I think that was just a red herring.

02:47:28.149 --> 02:47:29.329
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think that was the actual question.

02:47:29.349 --> 02:47:30.410
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the question was New Year's Eve.

02:47:30.850 --> 02:47:33.112
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, um... I don't know.

02:47:33.132 --> 02:47:35.513
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know what I'm doing for New Year's or whatever.

02:47:36.134 --> 02:47:38.455
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe somebody will kidnap me so we can all have a good time.

02:47:40.496 --> 02:47:41.737
[SPEAKER_18]: Because kidnappings are fun.

02:47:42.605 --> 02:47:46.026
[SPEAKER_13]: I know this is, like, way late, but I remember two things I'm mad at.

02:47:47.407 --> 02:47:48.807
[SPEAKER_13]: And these are both movie-related, too.

02:47:49.627 --> 02:47:55.829
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, I'm pissed off at Closer, because, um, Nellie Portman did not get naked.

02:47:56.790 --> 02:48:11.655
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm also pissed off at this other game, or, not, this other show called, uh, My Life, or, yeah, The Life, or something like that, starring Denise Richards, and SHE DIDN'T GET NAKED IN THAT EITHER, IT'S A FUCKING UNRATED GODDAMNED DVD!

02:48:12.964 --> 02:48:13.865
[SPEAKER_13]: It's supposed to get naked!

02:48:14.345 --> 02:48:15.206
[SPEAKER_13]: NAKED!

02:48:15.546 --> 02:48:19.628
[SPEAKER_13]: Your Playboy fucking get naked on the goddamn- It's a foreign film, even!

02:48:19.929 --> 02:48:22.130
[SPEAKER_13]: Where nudity's not even a big deal, but no!

02:48:23.131 --> 02:48:25.152
[SPEAKER_13]: Show your tits in fucking Playboy!

02:48:25.613 --> 02:48:27.134
[SPEAKER_13]: The worst fucking magazine out there.

02:48:27.694 --> 02:48:28.855
[SPEAKER_13]: Next to Entertainment Weekly.

02:48:30.776 --> 02:48:31.056
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways.

02:48:32.977 --> 02:48:33.638
[SPEAKER_14]: And New Year's Eve.

02:48:35.939 --> 02:48:37.140
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, probably watch TV.

02:48:37.200 --> 02:48:38.001
[SPEAKER_13]: What did we do last year?

02:48:38.061 --> 02:48:41.003
[SPEAKER_13]: I watched an Iron Chef marathon and then we had sex.

02:48:44.209 --> 02:48:46.431
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds like the perfect way to spend New Year's Eve.

02:48:47.432 --> 02:48:50.774
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't remember if it was New Year's or that was how I spent Halloween.

02:48:51.155 --> 02:48:55.398
[SPEAKER_13]: It was one of those holidays when we watched an Iron Chef marathon and had sex.

02:48:57.159 --> 02:48:58.280
[SPEAKER_13]: That could have been both, actually.

02:49:00.342 --> 02:49:00.642
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow.

02:49:01.563 --> 02:49:02.224
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it was New Year's.

02:49:02.904 --> 02:49:04.025
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, anyway, that's fine.

02:49:04.325 --> 02:49:07.468
[SPEAKER_14]: I got invited to a party, so I'll probably go.

02:49:07.628 --> 02:49:08.849
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what I'm doing for New Year's.

02:49:10.934 --> 02:49:14.177
[SPEAKER_14]: Unless the chance to have sex comes up, then I will ditch everybody.

02:49:15.699 --> 02:49:16.520
[SPEAKER_14]: And it has to be good sex.

02:49:16.960 --> 02:49:21.685
[SPEAKER_14]: EvilMalky2DX says, Speaking of internet crazes, ever heard of the OS Girls?

02:49:22.326 --> 02:49:28.312
[SPEAKER_14]: If y'all don't know, basically people in Japan created anime mascots for different operating systems.

02:49:28.392 --> 02:49:31.395
[SPEAKER_14]: But the real question... Okay, so have you guys ever heard of this?

02:49:32.156 --> 02:49:33.617
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, I have.

02:49:33.778 --> 02:49:34.198
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you think?

02:49:34.878 --> 02:49:38.141
[SPEAKER_13]: They did one that was posted on... Fuck, I don't remember now.

02:49:38.161 --> 02:49:43.926
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it was on Slashdot for Firefox, and they did some furry for that.

02:49:45.247 --> 02:49:45.748
[SPEAKER_13]: Some chick.

02:49:45.868 --> 02:49:55.456
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't get to see the other ones, because the link that they posted it to didn't... I couldn't find them in the person's gallery, but it was interesting.

02:49:55.897 --> 02:49:56.217
[SPEAKER_13]: I think I...

02:49:57.315 --> 02:50:00.257
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to say I posted that in my live journal, but I can't remember if I did or not.

02:50:00.337 --> 02:50:01.938
[SPEAKER_18]: Nope, I know who posted it in their live journal.

02:50:02.038 --> 02:50:07.181
[SPEAKER_13]: But, um, someone posted it in their live journal, and I'm going to show Rob here in the studio.

02:50:07.341 --> 02:50:10.924
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, actually, fuck, I'm going to have to, like, go through five pages of Friends stuff to find it.

02:50:11.744 --> 02:50:12.705
[SPEAKER_13]: Remember who posted that?

02:50:14.646 --> 02:50:14.906
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

02:50:15.867 --> 02:50:17.688
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways, Rob talk and I'll find it.

02:50:18.509 --> 02:50:18.809
[SPEAKER_14]: Fine.

02:50:18.889 --> 02:50:23.592
[SPEAKER_14]: The real question that even the Aoki2DX wants to ask is, what do y'all think of internet crazes?

02:50:25.393 --> 02:50:26.414
[SPEAKER_14]: I think they're funny.

02:50:28.470 --> 02:50:30.392
[SPEAKER_14]: I think they're funny until they get old.

02:50:30.792 --> 02:50:32.574
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, like, some things are getting old.

02:50:32.654 --> 02:50:36.057
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, I'm sorry, because I know Jamie's a fan, but I think Strong Bad is kind of old now.

02:50:37.719 --> 02:50:39.640
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I say I was a fan?

02:50:40.001 --> 02:50:41.882
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I just know you quote Strong Bad a lot.

02:50:42.403 --> 02:50:45.386
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because I live with Dan, and Dan quotes Strong Bad a lot.

02:50:47.207 --> 02:50:50.550
[SPEAKER_14]: I just think Homestar Runner is kind of like so last year.

02:50:53.693 --> 02:50:53.954
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

02:50:55.214 --> 02:50:55.855
[SPEAKER_14]: Anything else?

02:50:55.895 --> 02:50:56.596
[SPEAKER_14]: Internet crazes?

02:50:56.636 --> 02:50:58.278
[SPEAKER_14]: Anybody else have a comment on internet crazes?

02:50:59.299 --> 02:51:01.041
[SPEAKER_18]: No, because I can't think of any at the moment.

02:51:01.902 --> 02:51:02.983
[SPEAKER_14]: How about the hamster dance?

02:51:03.103 --> 02:51:04.405
[SPEAKER_14]: That was like three years ago.

02:51:04.825 --> 02:51:05.846
[SPEAKER_14]: The dancing baby.

02:51:06.347 --> 02:51:08.049
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, okay, the dancing baby.

02:51:08.089 --> 02:51:08.570
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, alright.

02:51:09.290 --> 02:51:11.373
[SPEAKER_18]: Eh, yeah, they're funny until they get old.

02:51:12.150 --> 02:51:15.052
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a scary comment from Dark Knight in the chatroom.

02:51:15.172 --> 02:51:21.137
[SPEAKER_14]: I could see the chairman starting Loki's sex romp.

02:51:22.298 --> 02:51:24.120
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, from Iron Chef.

02:51:24.420 --> 02:51:25.361
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I saw that picture.

02:51:25.401 --> 02:51:26.942
[SPEAKER_14]: There's the Firefox anime girl.

02:51:27.002 --> 02:51:29.424
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you, like, just post a link to chatroom or something?

02:51:29.844 --> 02:51:30.145
No, I can't.

02:51:31.045 --> 02:51:31.366
[SPEAKER_14]: Why not?

02:51:31.586 --> 02:51:32.326
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, because you're not in chat.

02:51:32.366 --> 02:51:33.787
[SPEAKER_14]: No, because I can't log in.

02:51:33.807 --> 02:51:34.368
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, that sucks.

02:51:35.117 --> 02:51:35.697
[SPEAKER_14]: Sucks to be you.

02:51:37.358 --> 02:51:39.299
[SPEAKER_14]: Moving on with the questions, Ask Orange Lounge.

02:51:39.339 --> 02:51:46.202
[SPEAKER_14]: If you have a question, you can send it to us via private message in IRC, or you can also give us a call on the Skype line.

02:51:46.222 --> 02:51:49.324
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to open up the Skype line for you boys and girls that want to give us a call over there.

02:51:50.484 --> 02:51:58.588
[SPEAKER_14]: Legend of Zaku says, if I were to down this death brick called the Hardee's Monster Thick Burger, I don't know if you've heard about this.

02:51:59.204 --> 02:52:00.425
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, those things are humongous.

02:52:00.505 --> 02:52:01.066
[SPEAKER_14]: I saw one.

02:52:01.106 --> 02:52:01.827
[SPEAKER_14]: It looked nasty.

02:52:02.607 --> 02:52:09.494
[SPEAKER_14]: What Oni courses would I have to do in order to burn off the 1400 plus calories that I'm taking in as a result of this burger?

02:52:09.754 --> 02:52:10.235
[SPEAKER_14]: All of them.

02:52:10.375 --> 02:52:12.016
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, all of them, basically.

02:52:12.177 --> 02:52:13.017
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll put it this way.

02:52:13.138 --> 02:52:15.099
[SPEAKER_14]: Legend Road five times.

02:52:15.440 --> 02:52:20.625
[SPEAKER_02]: You would have to lift weights vigorously for four solid hours to burn off that many calories.

02:52:22.076 --> 02:52:34.143
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm surprised Loki, I'm looking at the site right now, I'm surprised, and it's making that lightning noise right here, it's Hardee's.com, and I want Loki to see this, it's the Monster Burger.

02:52:36.365 --> 02:52:40.808
[SPEAKER_14]: Hardee's, of course, somewhat related to Carl's Jr., it's the Monster Thick Burger, look at that.

02:52:41.848 --> 02:52:44.230
[SPEAKER_13]: That's just a fucking bacon ultimate cheeseburger, that's all that is.

02:52:46.559 --> 02:52:48.659
[SPEAKER_14]: It's more than a bacon ultimate cheeseburger.

02:52:48.699 --> 02:52:49.720
[SPEAKER_02]: They're pretty humongous.

02:52:49.740 --> 02:52:51.940
[SPEAKER_14]: They're larger than the $6 burger.

02:52:51.980 --> 02:52:54.681
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that's like two of those $6 patties right there.

02:52:54.781 --> 02:52:57.061
[SPEAKER_14]: And, like, look at whatever that sauce is right there.

02:52:58.601 --> 02:52:59.021
[SPEAKER_14]: Yikes.

02:53:01.922 --> 02:53:07.003
[SPEAKER_13]: If you go to fucking Fuddruckers, you can get one pound patties there, okay?

02:53:07.103 --> 02:53:09.843
[SPEAKER_13]: So that burger ain't shit, okay?

02:53:11.844 --> 02:53:12.624
[SPEAKER_13]: But yeah, it looks tasty.

02:53:14.378 --> 02:53:15.439
[SPEAKER_14]: John Fields has a question.

02:53:15.619 --> 02:53:20.663
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, what if the chatroom forced Orange Lounge Radio to do a kids show like those you see on Nick Jr.

02:53:20.683 --> 02:53:21.944
[SPEAKER_14]: because of tonight's cage match?

02:53:22.124 --> 02:53:24.666
[SPEAKER_14]: What would it be like if the show were on Nick Jr.? ?

02:53:36.328 --> 02:53:37.569
[SPEAKER_00]: We wouldn't be on Nick Jr.

02:53:38.349 --> 02:53:42.172
[SPEAKER_14]: I would sell this show out to anybody that would take it and I know you guys would too and if Nick Jr.

02:53:42.192 --> 02:53:49.397
[SPEAKER_14]: was there I would have a live studio audience filled with children and I would make DarkSakura lecture them on proper grammar all night.

02:53:52.440 --> 02:53:56.402
[SPEAKER_02]: And then have remedial class for their parents on how to do their fucking jobs.

02:53:59.124 --> 02:53:59.545
[SPEAKER_14]: Beautiful.

02:54:01.126 --> 02:54:02.487
[SPEAKER_14]: Last question of the evening.

02:54:03.649 --> 02:54:06.394
[SPEAKER_14]: From Sigurd, okay, a real question.

02:54:07.096 --> 02:54:10.402
[SPEAKER_14]: Are there any solid plans for an E3 show this year?

02:54:12.105 --> 02:54:18.709
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I guess one of the big questions is if we even get to go to E3 in the first place.

02:54:19.170 --> 02:54:20.691
[SPEAKER_14]: We know DarkSakura gets to go.

02:54:20.771 --> 02:54:24.013
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki and I are pretty sure we're going to get to go again.

02:54:24.713 --> 02:54:25.594
[SPEAKER_14]: Cards look good.

02:54:25.634 --> 02:54:27.255
[SPEAKER_14]: If you went the year before, you can go again.

02:54:27.315 --> 02:54:28.556
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're kind of hoping that can happen.

02:54:28.996 --> 02:54:34.220
[SPEAKER_14]: So the answer is if we can get everything we need, which would include a laptop,

02:54:34.965 --> 02:54:35.666
[SPEAKER_14]: Hint, hint, Jamie.

02:54:35.846 --> 02:54:37.650
[SPEAKER_14]: Hint, hint, Jamie.

02:54:38.111 --> 02:54:46.287
[SPEAKER_14]: And we stay in a nice enough hotel this time where we're not in the Motel 6 in the middle of Hollywood and we instead stay at a motel that has free high-speed internet access.

02:54:47.284 --> 02:54:50.366
[SPEAKER_14]: Motel 7, or at least a Holiday Inn, which I think has that.

02:54:50.746 --> 02:54:52.528
[SPEAKER_14]: If we could do that, then yes, we could do a show.

02:54:52.628 --> 02:54:55.009
[SPEAKER_14]: Not necessarily from E3, but from the hotel.

02:54:55.049 --> 02:54:56.410
[SPEAKER_14]: But here's the other part of the question.

02:54:56.750 --> 02:55:00.513
[SPEAKER_14]: Would we want to spend our time in LA doing this program?

02:55:00.673 --> 02:55:01.053
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

02:55:01.554 --> 02:55:02.394
[SPEAKER_14]: So, maybe.

02:55:02.955 --> 02:55:04.856
[SPEAKER_14]: I think if worse comes to worse, we'll do something.

02:55:04.896 --> 02:55:06.957
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll do lots of tape segments from E3.

02:55:07.238 --> 02:55:09.019
[SPEAKER_14]: We're trying to do more at E3 this year.

02:55:09.719 --> 02:55:11.380
[SPEAKER_14]: Assuming, we have to find out if we can go first.

02:55:11.400 --> 02:55:15.423
[SPEAKER_14]: But if we can go, we're hoping to get more interviews and some many more fun stuff at E3.

02:55:15.463 --> 02:55:15.864
[SPEAKER_14]: But again...

02:55:17.313 --> 02:55:19.034
[SPEAKER_14]: It's still December.

02:55:19.275 --> 02:55:19.995
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a little early.

02:55:21.816 --> 02:55:23.558
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we'll see soon enough.

02:55:26.220 --> 02:55:29.442
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, that's going to do it for tonight's Ask Orange Lounge segment.

02:55:31.043 --> 02:55:32.244
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you say we do another break?

02:55:32.765 --> 02:55:34.626
[SPEAKER_14]: A quick break and come back and wrap it up.

02:55:36.007 --> 02:55:36.728
[SPEAKER_14]: You guys okay with that?

02:55:37.789 --> 02:55:38.349
[SPEAKER_18]: Works for me.

02:55:38.649 --> 02:55:42.052
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, let's do a break and in this break we're going to hear... I want to hear something new.

02:55:42.072 --> 02:55:43.433
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to hear an Ultramix 2 song.

02:55:43.473 --> 02:55:43.813
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's do...

02:55:45.538 --> 02:55:46.719
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, what song sounds good to you?

02:55:46.779 --> 02:55:49.762
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's do the Delirium song, since we're having a Delirium night.

02:55:50.282 --> 02:55:50.863
[SPEAKER_14]: How's that sound?

02:55:52.524 --> 02:55:53.125
[SPEAKER_02]: That works for me.

02:55:53.145 --> 02:55:56.247
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, we will be right back after this to wrap it up.

02:55:56.688 --> 02:55:57.168
[SPEAKER_14]: Stay with us.

02:55:58.569 --> 02:56:01.572
[SPEAKER_14]: The best is yet to come, because we all know the best part of the show is when it's over.

02:56:03.141 --> 02:56:08.025
[SPEAKER_05]: She knows the voices in her mind Say hello to me She says it's my nightmare

02:57:17.384 --> 02:57:18.473
I'm the one they say to love

02:57:56.854 --> 02:57:57.294
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello?

02:57:58.075 --> 02:57:59.096
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello, is this thing on?

02:57:59.156 --> 02:57:59.656
[SPEAKER_14]: Testing.

02:58:00.837 --> 02:58:01.718
[SPEAKER_14]: Testing, one, two.

02:58:02.299 --> 02:58:06.242
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking in the index, but I don't see anything for how to run a radio show.

02:58:06.342 --> 02:58:06.823
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello?

02:58:07.503 --> 02:58:08.964
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't understand this.

02:58:09.425 --> 02:58:10.346
[SPEAKER_02]: Does this thing work?

02:58:10.366 --> 02:58:11.967
[SPEAKER_02]: This thing reads like stereo instructions.

02:58:12.027 --> 02:58:12.648
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this on?

02:58:12.668 --> 02:58:13.248
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell?

02:58:15.810 --> 02:58:17.212
[SPEAKER_17]: Orange Lounge Radio.

02:58:17.392 --> 02:58:19.594
[SPEAKER_17]: Broke Down Ghetto Bomani Radio.

02:58:19.674 --> 02:58:19.874
[SPEAKER_05]: What the?

02:58:22.185 --> 02:58:23.647
[SPEAKER_14]: We are back to wrap it up.

02:58:24.207 --> 02:58:25.569
[SPEAKER_14]: Show's just about done with.

02:58:25.909 --> 02:58:27.912
[SPEAKER_14]: Another Sunday night, another show.

02:58:28.553 --> 02:58:30.535
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll be back next week with more fun stuff.

02:58:30.555 --> 02:58:32.497
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to try and line up a special guest for next week.

02:58:32.537 --> 02:58:35.201
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to do an interview next week, so we're going to try and line up a special guest.

02:58:35.221 --> 02:58:36.162
[SPEAKER_14]: Does that sound good to you guys?

02:58:37.199 --> 02:58:39.641
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I thought I'd bring up the game, or I can bring it up going after the script.

02:59:00.880 --> 02:59:04.182
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, that game that I like and that I got addicted to this week.

02:59:04.462 --> 02:59:05.883
[SPEAKER_14]: My bad, totally forgot about it.

02:59:05.923 --> 02:59:06.743
[SPEAKER_14]: Bring it up real quick.

02:59:06.783 --> 02:59:07.684
[SPEAKER_14]: Tell the folks about it.

02:59:07.704 --> 02:59:08.224
[SPEAKER_14]: What's it all about?

02:59:08.944 --> 02:59:15.108
[SPEAKER_18]: It's basically a side-scrolling RPG game called MapleStory.

02:59:15.188 --> 02:59:16.589
[SPEAKER_18]: Side-scrolling RPG?

02:59:16.789 --> 02:59:16.989
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

02:59:17.049 --> 02:59:17.969
[SPEAKER_14]: What is that game?

02:59:18.209 --> 02:59:22.792
[SPEAKER_18]: It kind of reminded me of Mystical Ninja at first, but, I don't know, it's pretty cool.

02:59:22.812 --> 02:59:24.013
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, you can pick up coins and stuff.

02:59:24.053 --> 02:59:24.573
[SPEAKER_18]: It's pretty cute.

02:59:25.348 --> 02:59:27.949
[SPEAKER_18]: It's one of those cutesy ones again, you know, like Ragnarok was.

02:59:27.989 --> 02:59:31.410
[SPEAKER_18]: It was cutesy, and it was cool, and it still is cool, but, you know.

02:59:32.390 --> 02:59:34.311
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, um, what was it?

02:59:34.451 --> 02:59:36.992
[SPEAKER_18]: Maple... I can't think of the website now.

02:59:37.032 --> 02:59:38.552
[SPEAKER_18]: MapleStory.

02:59:38.592 --> 02:59:39.732
[SPEAKER_18]: No, the game's MapleStory.

02:59:41.273 --> 02:59:44.694
[SPEAKER_18]: MapleGlobal.net or .com, I can't remember.

02:59:45.054 --> 02:59:51.416
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, for those people that want to check it out, go to MapleGlobal.com or .net.

02:59:52.616 --> 02:59:53.356
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe it's .com.

02:59:54.297 --> 02:59:54.977
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's .com.

02:59:58.123 --> 02:59:58.523
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not?

02:59:58.803 --> 03:00:23.991
[SPEAKER_14]: EvilNauki EvilNauki in our chatroom says MapleStory.com is the site I think it's MapleGlobal.com Anyway, that's where I found the thing to download it and register and all that stuff Sounds interesting, I might have to check this out Seems like a few people in our chat have heard of this before, so we'll see Alright, Angel's gonna hook me up with that later so I can check it out Loki, your final thought Oh, I'm sorry, Angel, is that your final thought, pretty much?

03:00:25.111 --> 03:00:26.752
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, bye Mr. Driller, cause it's fun

03:00:27.341 --> 03:00:28.122
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, your final thought.

03:00:28.902 --> 03:00:30.324
[SPEAKER_02]: It is MapleStory.com.

03:00:31.404 --> 03:00:42.274
[SPEAKER_13]: My final thought is I'm probably going to play some more Final Fantasy tonight because I like that game and I've spent so much time on it and yeah, that's all.

03:00:44.415 --> 03:00:48.299
[SPEAKER_14]: Jamie, my final thought is I'm probably going to do the same thing as soon as I take Angel home.

03:00:48.939 --> 03:00:49.860
[SPEAKER_14]: Jamie, your final thought.

03:00:49.920 --> 03:00:51.942
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, I have to run errands, which kind of sucks.

03:00:51.962 --> 03:00:52.562
[SPEAKER_14]: Jamie, your final thought.

03:00:54.104 --> 03:00:54.204
[SPEAKER_14]: Um...

03:00:56.485 --> 03:00:57.025
[SPEAKER_14]: Nevada.

[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

03:01:01.789 --> 03:01:03.851
[SPEAKER_14]: Now you're not going to have a final word.

03:01:04.351 --> 03:01:05.492
[SPEAKER_14]: So I have to give the final words.

03:01:05.512 --> 03:01:06.072
[SPEAKER_14]: I have another one.

03:01:06.212 --> 03:01:06.753

03:06:25.070 --> 03:06:25.911
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you getting back into that?

03:06:26.311 --> 03:06:27.352
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I may as well.

03:06:27.992 --> 03:06:28.773
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still paying for it.

03:06:29.313 --> 03:06:31.875
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, Episode 4 is being beta tested right now.

03:06:32.255 --> 03:06:32.615
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, joy.

03:06:32.976 --> 03:06:34.977
[SPEAKER_14]: And apparently the card thing is gone.

03:06:35.177 --> 03:06:36.858
[SPEAKER_02]: Good, because the card thing was retarded.

03:06:37.539 --> 03:06:38.340
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god.

03:06:38.820 --> 03:06:40.481
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this whole card craze thing?

03:06:41.542 --> 03:06:41.662
[SPEAKER_02]: Ugh.

03:06:42.483 --> 03:06:42.883
[SPEAKER_02]: Horrible.

03:06:45.339 --> 03:06:45.839
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I agree.

03:06:47.841 --> 03:06:48.161
[SPEAKER_14]: I agree.

03:06:48.542 --> 03:06:49.602
[SPEAKER_14]: The card thing was not good.

03:06:50.063 --> 03:06:53.305
[SPEAKER_14]: But we talked about that a little bit on Outside the Box a couple weeks ago.

03:06:54.406 --> 03:06:54.766
[SPEAKER_14]: Interesting.

03:06:56.047 --> 03:06:57.328
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, any exciting plans for the week?

03:06:59.550 --> 03:06:59.750
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

03:07:02.513 --> 03:07:02.973
[SPEAKER_14]: Very nice.

03:07:03.894 --> 03:07:05.855
[SPEAKER_14]: Angel, you got any exciting plans this week?

03:07:05.895 --> 03:07:06.736
[SPEAKER_14]: Y'all are pretty boring.

03:07:10.139 --> 03:07:11.019
[SPEAKER_18]: Nah, not really.

03:07:11.219 --> 03:07:13.081
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe play some more video games.

03:07:13.921 --> 03:07:14.562
[SPEAKER_18]: Like I always do.

03:07:16.934 --> 03:07:18.495
[SPEAKER_14]: Man, what do you people do for fun?

03:07:19.375 --> 03:07:20.115
[SPEAKER_14]: I want Boba.

03:07:21.156 --> 03:07:21.556
[SPEAKER_14]: You what?

03:07:21.716 --> 03:07:22.236
[SPEAKER_14]: I want Boba.

03:07:23.637 --> 03:07:29.119
[SPEAKER_14]: I hella want Boba, but I can't go out for Boba tonight because I have errands to run.

03:07:29.179 --> 03:07:32.060
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to get up at 5.30 in the morning.

03:07:32.541 --> 03:07:33.781
[SPEAKER_14]: Boba sounds like a good time, though.

03:07:33.801 --> 03:07:34.281
[SPEAKER_14]: It really does.

03:07:36.962 --> 03:07:38.063
[SPEAKER_14]: Darn you for bringing it up.

03:07:41.556 --> 03:07:42.657
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh well, what can you do?

03:07:44.037 --> 03:07:45.598
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, well, I guess that's it.

03:07:45.678 --> 03:07:47.820
[SPEAKER_14]: Unless anybody else has anything exciting they want to add?

03:07:49.721 --> 03:07:49.961
[SPEAKER_14]: No?

03:07:50.161 --> 03:07:50.781
[SPEAKER_14]: Alrighty then.

03:07:51.542 --> 03:07:54.123
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to go back to our Bomani Music and More program.

03:07:55.024 --> 03:07:58.446
[SPEAKER_14]: Commercial free tonight, boys and girls, for a little while after the show.

03:07:58.806 --> 03:08:03.689
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to start it off, though, with something special for those of you guys that stuck around, because I know a lot of you guys ditch us before the...

03:08:05.106 --> 03:08:12.129
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I want to play something kind of new, because it's new and desirable by people, because you don't get to hear it a whole lot.

03:08:12.509 --> 03:08:19.272
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're actually going to play that new remix, which we haven't really played a whole lot here on the station.

03:08:19.692 --> 03:08:21.553
[SPEAKER_14]: So some of you guys may actually not have heard it yet.

03:08:21.853 --> 03:08:23.474
[SPEAKER_14]: You know the Junk Circuit mix of I Feel?

03:08:23.994 --> 03:08:24.574
[SPEAKER_14]: You remember that one?

03:08:24.594 --> 03:08:28.196
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to play that for you guys, who stuck around for us.

03:08:28.356 --> 03:08:29.396
[SPEAKER_14]: And have a great night, everybody.

03:08:29.576 --> 03:08:31.177
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for tuning in and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.

03:08:31.417 --> 03:08:31.777
[SPEAKER_14]: Have a good one.

03:08:34.312 --> 03:08:35.072
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you feel it?

03:08:35.252 --> 03:08:35.933
Do you feel it?
