324677	328681	Have you ever seen that real emergency trauma show, but the one with pets?
329862	330883	Do I ever watch TV?
331544	332745	Well, I figured you might watch that.
332805	335187	If you have time for Iron Chef, you have time for this.
335207	337990	I download my Iron Chef, and I'm pissed off about Supernova.
340524	343787	We're all a little pissed off about Supernova, but I have the answer.
344668	346349	When we get back, we'll talk about that a little bit.
346789	350032	Also joining us tonight, Tech Massa, Loki!
351373	351773	Not!
352994	358439	Loki is at a holiday gathering tonight for his family, so he may come in a little bit later, but...
359366	360726	We all know he may not be here.
360786	363147	He's got no pressure to come back at any particular time.
363767	370169	You remember when Loki used to be here every single night for like two years, religiously?
370869	372169	And I mean every single night.
372289	374670	He was here for the second episode and I wasn't.
377551	378211	I remember that.
378271	378631	Alright.
379391	384432	Also joining us tonight, we do have a special guest able to fill in for the absence of a third co-host.
384452	385713	Say hello to DDR Angel.
387062	389622	Hello, I will not be as angsty as him, I'm sorry.
390503	391123	That's alright.
391403	393503	Maybe for once, this is what it is.
393783	397104	You're listening to the kindler, gentler Orange Songs Radio.
397784	399104	The Holiday Cheery Edition.
399204	400704	Oh wait, Jamie's still here, never mind.
400724	401885	Fuck you!
403285	403825	Alright.
405105	409406	This is gonna be weird, because tonight I'm outnumbered by women.
412326	413927	We're still gamers, so what's your point?
415107	416247	Girls play games?
417689	421110	I did nothing but play games for the past three days in a row, okay?
422931	424791	And it was all Phantasy Star Online.
424951	428072	Which is a good segue into how was your week, how was your day?
428212	428792	Ha ha ha.
429432	429792	Alright.
430533	440695	We'll get into that all a little bit more in a little bit, but first we're going to take a quick break featuring the mandatory song you know we have to play tonight, but we're only going to play it once this week, okay?
441136	445977	Because too many of you bitched last week, but because it is Christmas week here, we have to play it.
446517	447217	You already know.
447237	451979	If you don't know what song I'm talking about, you obviously haven't been playing DDR very long.
451999	452559	But that's okay.
452919	453579	We're here to help you.
453939	454319	Noob!
455860	456160	Alright.
457000	458000	Do I smell a noobie?
458680	459661	We'll be back after this.
459701	460601	Hey, join our chatroom.
461301	463842	www.orangesonstrator.com Click on chat.
463882	464302	We'll be back.
492656	498353	Night is nightfall
646057	651679	You guys know what?
651699	654200	The chat room was demanding more Silent Hill.
654360	655220	So, here you go.
671213	671918	and more.
728208	728810	Thanks for watching!
758506	761308	It's got to be forever, the raindrops blowing, the wind is dancing
780274	789980	It would be a much better fight With you, with me If you hadn't let me I'd be fine on my own, baby Never felt so lonely Then you came along So now what?
801367	810181	I'm strong out, addicted to you My body aches, now that you're gone My supplies fell through And you let me give me everything
819582	820863	Thank you for watching!
854213	859622	Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song, Orange Lounge Radio.
860444	866907	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 123 on your radio right now.
867247	870768	And I apologize to you guys if you're hearing a little bit of a buzz in the background tonight.
871088	875750	One of our cords, I think, is a little bit stripped, so we've got to get it replaced, and I think that stripping is causing the buzz.
876130	879231	So we'll look into getting that replaced before the new year.
879291	882653	But for tonight, you're going to have to deal with it, so I apologize.
883153	885654	Anyway, so here we are.
886394	887715	Almost at the end of 2004.
888395	898118	Just when I was finally remembering to write 04 on my checks instead of 03, the damn year's almost over, and now I'm going to have to start writing 05, or I'm really going to be screwed.
898599	900499	So, what's first?
900579	901840	Presence, or how was your week?
901860	902400	Presence!
902480	903240	Presence first?
903380	904721	You mean we're going to make an exception?
904981	905441	Presence!
905461	906181	The rule that we always do?
906362	907222	Presence!
907282	907622	Alright.
908662	909123	Fair enough.
909163	911704	I mean, presents are, you know... Okay, now...
913126	913927	Yeah, I know, Loki ran away.
913967	914407	We'll get him back.
915528	916489	Loki came home, by the way.
916529	921514	Loki came home during the break, so I don't know if he's going to be involved in this show tonight or if he's going to be kind of in and out or whatever.
921854	927239	But he's here, and he's trying to get our webcam up and running as well over on OrangeLaunchRadio.com, so check that out.
929161	930703	He says it's up and running.
930763	931944	Well, it's not on the website yet.
931984	934006	I've got to turn on the switch on the website.
934710	937997	Also joining us tonight, we have Arcadian42 came in during the break.
938498	939820	You know it's 6.30, buddy, right?
939840	940341	No, I'm just kidding.
940762	941804	Do we have a mic for Arcadian?
941925	942786	Was there another mic over there?
942806	943808	There should be another mic over there.
943889	944309	There should be.
944590	944931	Somewhere.
946240	946560	We get it?
946680	947361	Under the rubble.
947541	948202	There you go.
948902	954387	It's under the big Christmas present montage there we have all of Loki's presents.
954747	957830	By the way, I'd just like to point out I have not started my shopping yet.
958210	964895	So even though we are going to be doing a little bit of gifts tonight, it just makes Christmas last longer if I don't give my gifts until next week.
965936	966737	That's what you're calling it.
966917	971421	No, well, I'm not going to break my Christmas tradition of doing all my shopping on Christmas Eve.
971801	972942	So, sorry.
972982	973902	Stop the day after Christmas.
974622	975083	Or that.
975123	975743	That's even better, honestly.
975783	977584	That's why I've been telling everyone to get me gift cards.
978544	979625	Oh, gift cards are awesome.
980345	981186	So I can take advantage of them.
981206	982466	Didn't I get you a gift card last year?
983427	984667	I think you did.
984868	987709	I think you're probably going to get another one this year because they're the easiest presents to buy.
987729	989330	And you know what?
989410	991091	I went the day after Christmas.
991291	991891	Exactly.
991951	992711	It's a good gift to get.
992912	993612	All right, presents.
993632	995113	Then, Jamie, you better go first.
995153	996373	What's this first present you have here?
996413	997374	This is something from Angel.
997394	998734	I think it's like a couple of 40s.
999095	999395	It's about...
1000345	1001686	It's a bigger than a bread box.
1003728	1004849	Lengthwise, no.
1004889	1005489	Here's the thing.
1005790	1012375	Jamie has to guess her present in 20 questions or less or we're going to smash it in front of everybody.
1012595	1012695	No.
1012775	1013836	I'll guess after I open it.
1015137	1015478	Alright.
1016759	1018400	It's beer.
1019881	1022784	By the way, while Jamie is opening her gift,
1023769	1026612	We have a request from the chat room.
1027493	1030817	At some point tonight... Oh, what'd you get, Jamie?
1031138	1033340	It's a Coco mug set with teddy bears on it.
1033801	1035182	Aw, hot Coco.
1035383	1035963	That's cute.
1036905	1037565	That's precious.
1040248	1043793	And so Angel's standing there going, see, Jamie needs a little more cute once in a while.
1045177	1046278	It's very cute.
1046338	1047218	Ooh, Irish cream.
1047419	1047879	It makes me happy.
1047899	1048960	Anyway, sorry about that.
1049160	1051641	Our chat room over at Orangetownradio.com, clicking on chat.
1051862	1061388	They're requesting that at some point tonight, in his best Christmas voice, that Loki says, God bless us, everyone!
1062669	1064130	In his best Tiny Tim voice.
1064550	1065831	That's when hell freezes over.
1066992	1068172	At some point tonight, Loki.
1068252	1069473	That's all they want for Christmas.
1069533	1070274	I'm sure you can do it.
1071087	1072807	Alright, I'm going next.
1072947	1075188	I'm going to open... Angel got me two things.
1075888	1077128	Which one should I open first, Angel?
1078888	1080469	Okay, I'm going to do this one.
1081469	1084990	Which happens to be the same size as the one that Jamie got me.
1085170	1087690	I'm going to scream if it's the same thing I got you.
1089450	1090511	Open Jamie's first.
1090731	1093971	So you can still give this to somebody while it's still wrapped, just in case, right Angel?
1094251	1094711	Alright, here we go.
1094791	1096732	Then I'm going to open Jamie's first at Angel's request.
1096752	1097092	Here we go.
1097472	1097652	Ready?
1100807	1103468	It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas.
1103769	1104689	I hope it's a severed head.
1105589	1107210	That's a little flat for a severed head.
1107450	1108590	Maybe you put it in a blender.
1109891	1110831	Parade head.
1111251	1112292	You like tape, Jamie?
1112972	1115813	Okay, I suck at gift wrapping, so bite me.
1115833	1123676	This is the worst paper ever.
1126700	1128402	Oh, is this a Final Fantasy XI soundtrack?
1128462	1128962	Yes, it is.
1129122	1131564	What a cool... Oh, that's awesome.
1132105	1133706	Because you know I'm an addict and everything.
1134406	1135547	Is that the same thing you got, Angel?
1139350	1139831	It is?
1140371	1143373	I have been looking at that for three months.
1143453	1145835	Because I knew three months ago that's what I was going to buy for you.
1145855	1146716	Oh, poor Angel.
1147697	1147897	Do you...
1149835	1153937	I guess I'm easy to shop for, yet at the same time very difficult.
1154177	1154897	Well, thank you both.
1154957	1156137	It's a very, very nice thing.
1156177	1156798	Thank you, Jamie.
1157518	1159559	You're going to be able to do something with that, right, Angel?
1160539	1160819	Sure.
1161639	1162280	She says sure.
1163380	1164420	He has no idea.
1166281	1166521	Okay.
1166941	1167241	All right.
1167602	1169342	I'm going to open this.
1170723	1174004	A present from Angel, and it's in a, like, trapezoid-style box.
1181539	1183140	All I can see is limited guarantee.
1185181	1186442	Because I need that, don't I?
1186542	1188123	It's a Jenny Craig gift pack.
1189223	1190524	Oh, it's a case for the DS.
1190664	1191805	Good, because I need one of those.
1191905	1192445	I really do.
1195527	1197048	Ah, because I travel so damn much.
1197208	1198569	I got a traveling case for the DS.
1200114	1200434	Um, sure!
1200454	1202075	She was totally fucking with me
1225247	1228990	Oh my god, I was just looking at this yesterday and I almost bought it.
1229110	1230291	That is so funny.
1231212	1232913	It's Ping Pals for the DS.
1233293	1233694	Cool.
1234374	1235475	It's a whole DS.
1235555	1237597	It looks like a Pokemon-style game.
1237617	1238377	I couldn't figure it out.
1238477	1239458	Angel, what is this game about?
1240459	1246663	It's a mix between Pokemon and... What am I trying to say?
1246723	1247644	Tamagotchi, kind of.
1251567	1252207	That's cool.
1252408	1254049	I wanted to check this out, so that's good.
1254069	1254149	Yay!
1255970	1256891	Thank you guys.
1257011	1258413	I love you guys.
1258493	1258893	Give a hug.
1258953	1259314	Angel hug.
1260035	1261656	Even though I have headphones on, so I can't really move.
1261937	1265641	Long distance hug.
1265701	1267983	Can you feel the love here on Orange Lounge Radio?
1268844	1269325	Yeah.
1269505	1270246	I'm so excited.
1270887	1272689	I love Final Fantasy XI music too.
1272749	1273029	It's so good.
1274085	1276646	I figured that that would be something you'd really dig.
1276946	1278407	Okay, okay, Loki has seven in his present now.
1278487	1285570	Wait, I just want to say, this is like my favorite artwork in all of Final Fantasy XI, by the way, is that world map that's drawn all artistic style.
1285610	1286250	That's Amano.
1286350	1287891	If I could get a huge poster of that.
1287991	1288991	That's Amano's art.
1289152	1289412	Is it?
1290052	1290872	It's so sexy.
1290912	1294834	He did all, because I used to use one of those wallpapers when I, for the short time I played.
1296721	1297322	Very sexy.
1297902	1300004	I'm going to put this up on the webcam.
1300244	1302345	We'll put all the presents up on the webcam at some point during the show.
1302365	1304567	www.orangelingerator.com Loki's turn.
1305468	1306529	Loki, Loki, Loki.
1306729	1308370	Loki is opening a present from Jamie.
1308790	1310051	It was a bitch to wrap.
1322241	1324223	It's a Grim Reaper slash toy.
1326286	1329888	Yes, Jamie has given Loki death for Christmas.
1329988	1330788	That's lovely.
1330849	1336772	I tried to get a cupcake to put with him so I could give you death cake, but I didn't have time.
1336852	1338373	That would have been killer.
1339793	1340834	Very cool.
1341894	1342555	Isn't he cute?
1342735	1344316	It's a happy little holiday.
1345136	1347337	Oh, and another one for Loki from Angel.
1347878	1348578	Let's see what this is.
1349198	1350639	Is it another Iraqi suicide baby?
1352680	1353120	Let's see.
1353821	1354021	It's a
1358644	1360665	It's an amazing pooping reindeer.
1360745	1361965	That's lovely.
1367807	1370668	Nellie's infatuated with the pooping reindeer, apparently.
1371249	1372329	And you can eat the poop.
1376690	1377851	Are you going to give Nellie the poop?
1379048	1382351	Yeah, she can have the poop.
1382671	1386394	We're going to put this all on the webcam so you guys can see during the next break.
1386414	1386874	We'll get to it.
1387275	1391698	Or actually, I'll walk over there right now while Jamie... Don't give me Happy Jones Soda.
1391758	1392719	Is that all the gifts?
1393500	1393720	Okay.
1394720	1396022	Well, there'll be more gifts next week.
1396122	1396602	I promise.
1398283	1401426	Well, we're going to just find a way to get it to you anyway, DDR Angel.
1401966	1402967	Alright, here we go.
1403567	1404288	I got a whole week.
1404788	1405149	Alright.
1409917	1411579	Let's go back to how we start off every show.
1412240	1414724	We got a little sidetracked, but presents are a good reason to sidetrack.
1415065	1416146	I like presents.
1416166	1420113	We're going to start off tonight's show playing a little bit of How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day?
1421434	1425799	Well, my week was all, I was just feeling really stressed out and crappy all week.
1427000	1428602	I went to my last day of class on Monday.
1429583	1431706	I found out that I made a B in my business law class.
1432667	1438874	I made a 390 out of 400 in my Excel class, so I have a very solid A in that class.
1440235	1446358	Um, yeah, I made like a hundred on my final and they, uh, full points on my final project too.
1447118	1449199	So, I'm all happy and excited about that.
1449219	1452521	That means I have like a 3.2 something GPA for the semester.
1453601	1453681	Um...
1455502	1459225	I paid 300 and something dollars for my next classes, which kind of sucked.
1460045	1464349	But I was really, really stressed out all week and really exhausted.
1464369	1467331	And then finally, Thursday, I just collapsed at work.
1467391	1470873	I was all, you know, totally lacking in energy.
1471073	1473675	And I ended up going home after half a day.
1474516	1477038	And then I tried, because I was just really sick.
1477802	1505619	and then I felt better the next day so I got up to go back to work and only managed to stay three hours before I had to come home again and I did nothing then but sleep and play Phantasy Star online for the past three days nothing but that so yeah, I'm back to playing PSO I'm not an addict because I don't really want to play anymore for some time I basically went, I made it to level 41 in three days
1509060	1511629	We're trying to get me to Ultimate so I have 40 more levels to go.
1515367	1517929	Anyway, that's really all I did.
1518069	1521992	We went to this place called Crickets on Auburn yesterday.
1522752	1526415	That my friends were up and down was going to be like the best breakfast place ever.
1527636	1530898	And it was just ass.
1531118	1534200	My French toast was just egg and milk on bread.
1535461	1538643	And like I saw them put plates on top of full plates of food.
1539364	1540384	It was really disgusting.
1541745	1545026	And my potatoes were cold.
1546426	1548886	They were nice there, but it was just kind of crap.
1548946	1551347	So I wouldn't recommend anybody go there.
1552147	1553547	And I'm not going there again.
1554127	1556228	But it made my day really grumpy yesterday.
1557008	1558048	I was really grumpy yesterday.
1558368	1560349	Until I had a breakfast burrito, and that made it all better.
1560369	1563389	And then I played Phantasy Star Online for about six hours.
1564929	1565730	That's all I did.
1566470	1567570	PSO and sleep.
1570239	1572020	Sounds very similar to a lot of my weekends.
1572581	1574662	Sounds very similar to a lot of my weekends, but with a different game.
1576444	1577905	Eggnog is so good.
1579066	1580507	Baskin Robbins Eggnog Ice Cream.
1581167	1582088	And brand name, even.
1582328	1584570	And they have pumpkin pie ice cream, too.
1587812	1588853	This guy has a bony ass.
1595095	1599437	Did you just make the Christmas reindeer poop on your girlfriend's head?
1600317	1601578	You need to put that thing on the cam.
1603079	1606400	Go put that on... Make it poop in her mouth.
1606900	1607100	Do it.
1607701	1608681	Make it poop in her mouth.
1612083	1612643	That's hot.
1615030	1617332	DDR Angel, how was your week, how was your day?
1636806	1650009	Good, I had finals on Wednesday, and, um, tried to start my shopping in the middle of the week, but that thing didn't exactly go so well, so I guess I started on, what, Friday?
1650249	1653970	Yeah, Friday, I believe it was Friday, or Saturday or something.
1654430	1661872	But, um, I got sucked into the world in which, um, well, at least three of the people in here are hooked into.
1662312	1663533	Yes, Final Fantasy XI, yay me.
1665726	1666927	I got my hat!
1667087	1667987	Yay!
1668948	1671369	Even I haven't done that fucking Santa hat quest yet.
1673170	1674211	Insert word here.
1674231	1679074	That's okay, I had a bajillion Santa hats on RO.
1680614	1682936	Are they doing those Christmas wrappy things again?
1683116	1685937	Yeah, they're doing the Christmas present ones.
1686518	1690100	But I've been trying to get a Christmas present so I can get the heart of Opa Opa.
1691241	1696722	Because I have, what Julie gave me as part of my Christmas present on PSO is I have an Opa Opa mag.
1697083	1700864	I'm going to tell you about the nerdiest thing you've ever heard in a little bit about an online game and Christmas events.
1701324	1705645	But I've got to say, the Christmas event in Final Fantasy XI this year, not as good as last year's.
1705845	1706665	Last year's was awesome.
1707065	1709566	It was kind of fun on RO going around beating up Santa Claus.
1709966	1711066	Anyway, sorry Angel to cut you off.
1712687	1717528	Not much, just, you know, the Santa hat thing was like the last thing I wanted to say.
1718993	1722015	Oh, the funniest thing part of this week, and it happened yesterday.
1723096	1724977	Miklatov, a.k.a.
1725157	1728600	Sigurd, totally ran past me in Winders.
1728740	1730561	He didn't even know it was me, and I had to page him.
1730581	1731462	I'm like, hey!
1731702	1732402	He's like, hi!
1732602	1734063	I'm like, yeah, you just ran past me.
1734083	1734984	He's like, I did?
1735004	1736245	I'm like, yeah, you did.
1736985	1737385	It was funny.
1737566	1738046	Anyway, whatever.
1738586	1742509	Well, you know, in Final Fantasy XI, sometimes if you're in a crowded area, the characters don't load all the same.
1742729	1747232	Like, if you go into Lower Juno, I don't know if you've been there yet, but there's so many people there that it takes a while for everybody to load.
1748393	1749793	So I spent five minutes chasing him.
1750034	1750834	Then he kind of got the hint.
1750874	1751394	He's like, oh.
1753675	1754135	That's cool.
1754755	1755115	All right.
1756456	1756896	Moving on.
1756916	1757756	Let's go over to Loki.
1757876	1758736	Loki, how was your week?
1758777	1759337	How was your day?
1759577	1760637	I know you must have had a busy day.
1761677	1762538	I had one more thing that happened.
1762558	1763078	I'm sorry.
1763118	1764018	Did we cut you off earlier?
1764158	1765979	No, but I had one more thing that happened.
1766079	1767019	Is that your DS?
1767139	1767760	This is my DS.
1767820	1770300	How many freaking people have to bring their DSs to the show?
1770320	1771561	I always keep mine in my laptop case.
1771641	1772121	All right, fine.
1772141	1773021	So I can play it at work.
1773301	1773581	All right.
1774282	1774602	Oh, yeah.
1774662	1776342	I ordered my Christmas present from Dan today.
1777503	1777863	Which is?
1778510	1782031	Beatmania 2DXA style, and the Parappa clapping game.
1782291	1789314	Do you know, do you know I just, we're going to talk about this a little later, but you could have ordered another game on PlayAsia, which just started taking orders.
1789454	1789794	What?
1791274	1792135	We'll talk about it in a little bit.
1792155	1792355	Okay.
1794535	1794895	Alright.
1799257	1800237	Alright, anyway, moving on.
1800317	1800637	Loki.
1802198	1805559	Um, today I went to my dad's house and we had food.
1810459	1835850	and um what else did I do this week oh I went and saw Lemony Sick it's a series of unfortunate events and that was awesome and I play a lot of Final Fantasy and Christmas Shopping and yeah that's pretty much all I did just Christmas crap trying to get it done and then I got
1836212	1837593	Mr. Bradley, how was your week?
1837613	1838493	How was your day?
1838573	1839993	It was alright.
1840054	1840854	Did work and stuff.
1865154	1873081	Got 8th style like the week before, and didn't play it again until Friday and Saturday, and some today.
1874602	1875163	And did alright.
1875283	1876904	I actually passed V for the first time ever.
1877225	1879407	That's nice.
1880267	1882489	Though I don't know if it's easier timing or whatever.
1883450	1889816	I almost passed Nebula Grasper, but the first time I played it, and it killed me the rest of the time.
1891077	1892198	And, uh, yeah.
1894423	1896765	and a Christmas party at work on Friday.
1896785	1898626	That's it.
1900688	1902189	Nothing did not much today.
1905432	1905812	Okay.
1907728	1909910	Congratulations on beating V. I still can't do that.
1909950	1910471	It's too tough.
1910871	1911512	It's too hard.
1912033	1913895	But of course, I haven't played 2DX seriously in a long time.
1913935	1916357	I really, really need to get 8-style, and I will one of these days.
1917478	1919180	Anyway, my week and my day.
1919200	1923465	You know, I spent part of the week in L.A., which is why there was no Outside the Box this week.
1923505	1924246	I was actually in L.A.
1924266	1924986	the second half of the week.
1925027	1925988	I was on a business trip.
1926568	1927589	I had a really good time.
1927669	1931234	I must say, I had a really just awesome time, but it was really busy.
1931274	1935559	We just went everywhere, and we were just busy nonstop.
1935579	1940444	And I actually got homework in the class, which was kind of weird, considering it was training, but that's what happens when you're on salary.
1941886	1946651	And then Saturday, I was hoping to go to the SVGL3 tournament.
1947792	1952356	But I didn't end up going because I was just so damn tired and I had to do errands with my parents and all this other stuff.
1952396	1954057	So I didn't end up going.
1954957	1957159	And I'm sorry, Angel, because I know you wanted to go.
1957939	1959621	But she seems okay with it.
1960201	1965405	And I'm sorry to everybody out there who was hoping to, or I should say I was hoping to run into it at Spiegel 3.
1966550	1973513	But I just got beat out by wanting to sit at home and just recuperate, so that's exactly what I did.
1973973	1975353	And I played a lot of Final Fantasy XI.
1975533	1980115	In fact, what ended up happening is that Saturday, here's that nerdy thing I was talking to you about.
1980495	1990619	My link shell in Final Fantasy XI, you know that's the group that you belong to, we all met up and we had a level one foot race, which means we took a level one character and took them to the most difficult areas of the game.
1990959	1991640	I was in the lead.
1991660	1992380	I was in the lead, so I guess.
2015382	2017143	He said he was in the lead, so he got taken out.
2018925	2025011	And then we had, get this, a Final Fantasy XI gift exchange once we all got to Juno.
2025051	2030296	We all had a secret person we were supposed to buy gifts for, so we had a secret Santa in Final Fantasy XI.
2030756	2033999	And I got a plus one silver hairpin and a dagger.
2036181	2037803	That is the nerdiest thing, isn't it?
2038516	2038716	What?
2039236	2040297	I didn't get anything.
2040377	2040857	You know what?
2041037	2058924	Actually, I know you did, and I think I know who has you too, but it's just that our little shellmaster, or I shouldn't say shellmaster, but event organizer, because Loki's the shellmaster, but our event organizer needs to get up off her ass and get the rest of the gifts distributed to those that weren't here, so that's what'll happen.
2060129	2060409	All right.
2061330	2061610	Anyway.
2062371	2064233	So that's my nerdy Final Fantasy XI story.
2064253	2064773	What can I say?
2065474	2065834	All right.
2066495	2068837	Anybody else have anything they want to add about their week, their day?
2069037	2070558	I've got new contacts.
2071099	2071859	New contacts!
2072039	2072780	Are they a different color?
2072960	2073561	They don't look like it.
2076403	2079626	Well, they're not tinted because they're not IQB2s now.
2079646	2084470	They've got some different kind that helps correct for astigmatism or something.
2084991	2085251	Okay.
2085291	2086512	So is everything a little clearer now?
2090979	2092000	How many fingers am I holding up?
2096743	2097783	I'll give it back to you.
2099524	2100565	I got it back.
2101506	2104708	Anyway, we're such great radio.
2104928	2105368	This is great.
2106429	2108390	What have we done tonight that's been great radio bits?
2108430	2109731	How many fingers am I holding up?
2109771	2110671	That's a great radio bit.
2111132	2113133	Poop in my mouth, that's a really good radio bit.
2113213	2113473	Thank you.
2114811	2117132	That's a really great radio event.
2117492	2119053	Let's play radio charades.
2119073	2129937	This is why they laugh at our faces at E3 and go, Internet radio for games?
2130457	2131437	You losers.
2132378	2134979	Yeah, I'm going to poop in your mouth at E3, alright?
2135059	2135939	I see how you like it.
2138380	2140781	Alright, we have some big Bobani news this week.
2141926	2142326	NightStyle
2171411	2171942	Thanks for watching!
2216498	2217319	Thank you for watching!
2306085	2306606	and many more.
2377288	2377799	Thanks for watching!
2429441	2430602	DarkSakura!
2430722	2431482	DarkSakura!
2455204	2455904	DarkSakura
2530616	2536425	Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.
2541007	2548790	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and we've been playing PictoChat during the break because we're such dorks.
2548890	2551331	I don't really have a better explanation other than that.
2551851	2559814	But if you've been keeping an eye on our webcam, www.orangeloungeradio.com, I did put up a picture of the pooping reindeer during the break there, as well as a little glimpse of PictoChat.
2563376	2564356	Wait, what'd you find out, Ellie?
2567090	2575056	How do you shove the poop back in their ass?
2575816	2581160	Why don't you go back to Loki's room and see what else you can shove up there?
2582440	2583581	Go to hell.
2584582	2587424	Anyway, as we alluded to before we went to the break there,
2588317	2602183	We do have Beatmania 2DX Nightstyle somewhat announced for release and I say somewhat announced because basically all they really have to go off of right now I should say all we really have to go off of right now is a website that Konami of Japan has.
2602203	2616910	It's actually Konami Broadcasting and they have this page which appears to be listing some of their new releases and on March 24th of 2005 they have listed Beatmania 2DX Nightstyle which means Nightstyle looks like
2617910	2637625	That's all we need is confirmation that 9th style will be coming out at home for sure, which is really good because basically we've had, what, 7th style, 8th style, and now 9th style all within... I mean, we had to go, like, a long time, like, probably, what, a year and a half with no new 2DX releases at least, and then suddenly 7th style, 8th style, 9th style, and probably 10th style are all going to come out back-to-back-to-back.
2638106	2643730	So, well, not back-to-back, literally, but, you know, within a pretty good distance of each other, so this is pretty exciting, so...
2645820	2647742	Are you guys excited about this news?
2648822	2651864	What do you think about it?
2651884	2653385	You have to come stand on a mic, Jamie.
2654126	2657128	What do you think of this news, Angel?
2657909	2658789	Well, I like it.
2659930	2660490	Obviously.
2661391	2662952	Jamie is back to present her opinion.
2664373	2666375	As long as it doesn't have the shit timing problems.
2668016	2670557	You know, as long as it's not that problem, then it's cool.
2671138	2672439	It'd be an improvement over the arcade.
2674082	2677284	So, basically... Sorry, we're having a little bit of sound issues here.
2677324	2682787	Those same problems I was talking about when the show started with the stripped... Stripped wires causing us to have a little bit of issue here.
2683287	2685168	We're going to get that cord replaced for next week.
2685228	2685709	Sorry, guys.
2686449	2688150	Oh, I think I see exactly where the problem is, too.
2690231	2690731	Play nice!
2691492	2691932	Anyway, yes.
2692292	2696895	So, obviously... 2DX and the arcade had a little bit of...
2698636	2710959	I think the question on everybody's mind is, is it going to be fixed for the home release, or would they keep it arcade accurate so that people who practice at home can take it to the arcade, or what's going to happen?
2711539	2711919	I don't know.
2712339	2714899	Any thoughts from a technical perspective, Loki?
2714939	2718340	I know you probably don't even care about this game, but I just thought I'd get your opinion anyway.
2719420	2720821	That would be an accurate assumption.
2722981	2724181	Okay, then tell me what you think.
2726002	2726882	Well, it's a new game, yeah.
2728240	2728660	I have a pretzel.
2731483	2736687	So, the timing problems in Night Style are enough to make you despise this game, Jamie, or what's the deal?
2738889	2744554	Well, after seeing how bad the timing problems were, I swore I'd never play Night Style, and I haven't.
2745555	2747376	But do you think you're going to make an exception for the home release?
2747596	2749698	If the home release doesn't have the timing problems, then I'll buy it.
2750459	2750639	Mm-hmm.
2751667	2752048	Fair enough.
2753090	2761788	Alright, I just know I'm looking forward to with Nightstyle the new songs because Nightstyle has probably one of my favorite song lists of any
2763334	2789416	2DX Style, really, I think it had my most favorite song list since at least 6th style, probably, maybe since 5th, I don't know, but 9th style had just so many great songs on it that I love, and I can't wait to play it at home, because I really only played 9th style in the arcade, myself personally, I think I only played 9th style in the arcade like one time, two times, I think two times is the most times I played 9th style in the arcade, and really when I went and played 10th style, I pretty much only played 9th style songs.
2791229	2792890	I was kind of one of those losers that just played those.
2792910	2793330	I played Gradius.
2794110	2796831	Well, I mean, that's a 10-style song, though.
2796851	2797852	That's not a 9-style song.
2798252	2799952	I just couldn't play on that 10-style machine.
2802293	2809336	I'm excited because since we had so many consumer songs and... Don't mess with the sound right now because we're... Wait for a break.
2811477	2819860	We had so many new songs on consumer-style aid that it's going to be interesting to see if we get as many on 9-style as well.
2822325	2824428	You guys hoping to see a lot of new consumer tracks?
2824628	2826671	Or you just want it to be arcade accurate?
2826831	2828093	Bring back a lot of old songs?
2828654	2828974	Or what?
2829495	2830476	Any feelings on that?
2831798	2833460	I want it to have no timing problems.
2834802	2836844	I want it to play like 8th style.
2837065	2839388	You don't care what the hell's in it, as long as it's...
2840711	2841772	As long as it has no timing problems.
2841792	2842513	As long as it has no timing problems.
2842533	2843694	Because I want to play Lion Suki.
2844254	2853003	I want to see more of the ghetto fabulous dancers, like in that one song, the 8th style consumer song that has... I miss the 4th style booty dancers.
2853784	2854504	To bring those back?
2854605	2855605	The Geary Geary Daddy dancers.
2855625	2859770	Who are the ones that look like the fembots in the one video in... Oh, God.
2860490	2861651	I can't remember the name of the song.
2862252	2862853	Somebody will get it.
2862893	2863193	I don't know.
2864242	2866763	I'm just happy that my 8th style is going to be here at the end of the week.
2867303	2868083	So I can play dancer.
2868523	2872224	So as you were saying before, you went ahead and you ordered your 8th style.
2873124	2873324	Yeah.
2873564	2884366	Well, you know, I got a little private message in the chat room over here saying DarkLionXVI says that actually over on PlayAsia right now, you can pre-order 9th style if you're so inclined.
2884926	2887627	I'm not going to pre-order it until I know that the issues are fixed.
2890031	2892272	Don't Be Afraid Myself is what they're saying it is.
2892672	2893493	I don't think that's it.
2893573	2896014	It was like Love Something was the name of the song.
2896034	2898256	Don't Be Afraid Myself had the girls dancing in the bathroom.
2898276	2903879	That's the one, yeah, that's the one that's like the, I don't know, the pop video.
2903959	2907661	I'm talking about the one that had the... They were dancing in a damn locker room shower.
2907861	2909842	Yeah, I'm not, that's not the one I'm thinking of.
2909882	2916526	I'm thinking of the one where they're all dressed up in the hippie stuff and they were driving through Tokyo and stuff or something.
2919275	2920397	Why can't I think of the name of that song?
2920437	2923681	I'm looking it up right now because I'm so pissed I can't think of what that song is.
2925943	2926624	Love Box!
2927946	2928447	Love Box.
2928927	2930189	That's the song I was trying to think of.
2931050	2932071	It's got a pretty dirty title.
2932091	2933373	Yeah, Nelly's snickering over there.
2934094	2934955	He said box.
2937238	2937518	Alright.
2939955	2943816	Anyway, so most folks are going to be pretty excited about Night Style.
2943836	2949018	Of course, as soon as we know more information about the game, we will be presenting it to you guys.
2949659	2955341	And it's funny, looking in the chatroom, they're going, Lovebox, Lovebox, fucking Lovebox, god damn.
2956241	2958122	You have to remember, guys, you're on a buffer.
2958182	2963624	You're about 30, 45 seconds behind everything, so... Losers.
2965359	2969721	Alright, I guess what we'll do is we're going to take another quick break because it looks like we're working on some sound issues in here.
2969741	2973663	We're going to do a quick break, some more 2DX9 style songs since we're so excited about this.
2974223	2977264	And when we come back, maybe we'll take some calls over the Skype line.
2977584	2979645	Also, at some point tonight, we've got to do a new list list.
2980185	2982506	We have to have a cage match tonight at some point.
2983167	2985407	And we'll listen to Jamie Belch some more.
2985548	2986208	I'm sorry.
2986708	2987148	It's your fault.
2987168	2988029	You gave me the soda.
2988229	2989589	Alright, you're right.
2989649	2991170	This is the best stuff in the world.
2991530	2991830	You're right.
2991870	2992430	It's all my fault.
2992470	2993591	Sugar-free junk soda.
2994520	2996944	Alright, we'll be back after this, you guys.
3037913	3038594	Thanks for watching!
3113375	3115948	We'll be right back after some more music here on Orange Lounge Radio.
3234620	3234784	and more.
3266158	3267200	Thank you for watching!
3360687	3386468	Orange Lounge Radio With the Ping Pong Balls We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio And it looks like we actually fixed some of the sound We replaced a cord So Loki was kind enough to do a little switcheroo there during the break Swapped a cord out So hopefully that'll minimize those sound issues we've been having I notice the buzz is still there a little bit But it doesn't sound as bad in my monitor here So we'll see
3387611	3388412	Thank God!
3389172	3389453	All right.
3389893	3390654	Hooray for Loki!
3390674	3392095	This is why we call him the Techmaster.
3393456	3398680	In the chatroom during that break, they were complaining, or I shouldn't say complaining, but they were talking about some of the different Night Style songs.
3398980	3400361	Do you have a favorite Night Style song?
3400401	3403164	Even though the timing pushes you off, is there a favorite Night Style song you have?
3403184	3404124	All of the Taku songs.
3405526	3407407	Like, uh, what, Distress and, uh, Lower World?
3407427	3408528	Distress, I'd have to say.
3408548	3408988	No, Lower World.
3409008	3409789	What the hell am I thinking?
3409809	3412891	I'd have to say, actually, Distress is the best.
3413352	3414613	And, of course, I'd do, like, Lionski.
3416498	3419179	My favorite song in 9th style is Power Dream, because I love ping pong.
3420499	3426701	There's another one that I liked, but I don't remember the name of it, because I didn't really keep up too much with 9th style.
3426801	3427721	And of course, Bad Boy Bass.
3430561	3432802	Everyone is something, I don't remember the song.
3435463	3435783	Alright.
3435803	3441084	What we're going to do now is we're actually going to talk to somebody over the Skype line.
3442148	3448816	Somebody actually called and said they had something they wanted to talk to us about, so we're going to go ahead and pick up the Skype line here.
3448856	3450198	I just told them to give us a call here.
3451179	3452341	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3453602	3454263	Hey, what's up?
3454523	3455524	Hi, and who is this?
3456506	3457146	It's Sherlock.
3457407	3458688	Hi, Sherlock, how are you?
3459953	3460914	How are you doing today?
3461114	3461715	I'm good!
3461795	3470323	For those of you folks who don't know, Sherlock, one of the moderators over on DDR Freak, which by the way, DDR Freak, kind enough to replay Orange Lounge Radio Friday nights.
3470383	3471944	And he has the best hat ever.
3472585	3474166	That hat is sexy.
3476528	3479591	I've seen pictures of the hat and I think I saw the hat from a distance at E3.
3480732	3484614	It was kind of like going to a rock concert.
3484694	3487676	It's like, you know, I think I can kind of make it out.
3487836	3489757	I think I can kind of make out that person.
3490077	3490978	You can almost see it.
3491098	3491899	You can almost see it.
3492179	3493199	Well, what's on your mind, Sherlock?
3495180	3503365	I found something online that kind of confused me a bit, but it also made me just spin my head, and it really just threw me for a turn.
3503425	3504746	It's DDR-related.
3505425	3513195	and uh... A lot of DDR things kind of make me question myself sometimes, but... Yeah, I mean, you know, everyone keeps talking about, you know, is DDR dead?
3513235	3513935	What's going on?
3513955	3517440	You know, the whole April Fool's thing, you know, put everyone in for a turn.
3517920	3521524	But, something came up that really confused me.
3521685	3521745	If...
3522418	3530943	If you guys go to the Konami Arcade website for DDR Extreme, it's konami.co.jp slash am slash ddr underscore new.
3531443	3534005	Brings you up to the DDR website for DDR Extreme.
3534165	3535245	Oh, run that by me one more time.
3535265	3547833	konami.co.jp slash am slash ddr slash ddr new slash ddr new Alright?
3548033	3549874	Yeah, it's the Extreme webpage.
3551028	3557550	And if you look at it, the logo up top has a little Santa Claus logo in it.
3558790	3566291	Now, what I'm trying to figure out is why they decided to update a two-year-old webpage with a little Santa Claus logo.
3566672	3569272	Okay, Loki's tapping me, he says it's, what?
3569552	3571873	That's fucking old, that's from like last time.
3571913	3575113	That was back when they were talking about the original DDR stream coming out.
3575674	3577374	And that Santa Claus has been there all the time.
3578300	3579020	No, it hasn't.
3579100	3580061	Not that I remember.
3580621	3581181	It's been there.
3581321	3581761	Trust me.
3583562	3584902	I've never seen that there before.
3585422	3585943	Interesting.
3586003	3591364	Okay, now, but I do remember that Extreme came out at Christmas time.
3591644	3592685	I do remember that.
3593005	3595226	Extreme came out Christmas Day in 2002, didn't it?
3596026	3596526	I want to say.
3596546	3598306	It's been there.
3598827	3600547	Loki swears up and down it's been there the whole time.
3601528	3602308	It hasn't been.
3602408	3602768	No.
3604028	3605729	Why would they keep it there over summer?
3606793	3612155	Well, I mean, but isn't, yeah, this is the journal of Naoki Madea and stuff.
3612215	3614096	Why would they bother to update this?
3614176	3614656	I don't know.
3615596	3617577	You, well, I don't know.
3618017	3619037	I wish I could say.
3619858	3621418	It's not the same, and I'll tell you why.
3621758	3622038	Okay.
3622279	3627200	Because the image name is ddrex2.gif.
3628261	3630121	And then, well, if you view the image.
3630621	3631622	If you take out the 2.
3632562	3634823	Yeah, if you take out the 2, there's the original logo.
3636314	3636955	Hmm.
3637055	3641718	So... Well, but when did the journal... Okay, Loki's getting frustrated.
3642779	3648143	Because that was like one of the last journals that they did on there, and they changed the logo for the last journal.
3648523	3655849	DDR EX... The EX1 or whatever is for the previous journals in that series there, because there's multiple pages for that journal, so...
3656437	3657998	I know there is, but I don't know.
3658658	3658898	Old.
3659899	3660079	Old.
3660279	3661580	It's not anything new.
3661840	3662520	It's old.
3663241	3664581	Loki, quit ruining Christmas.
3664741	3665182	Jesus.
3666903	3669124	Give the boy hope for this holiday season.
3669144	3671485	What the hell is wrong with you, you Grinch?
3672706	3673326	All right, fine.
3673346	3674767	If you want to go ahead and do that.
3675167	3678489	If you look at that picture through a center graph, there's a secret code in there.
3678509	3682471	It takes you to a secret website that's all about the background information of DDR EX2.
3684076	3684376	Really?
3684416	3685037	There you go.
3685417	3687319	There's your conspiracy theory for the year.
3687399	3688179	Is it purple?
3689981	3690741	It's not purple.
3690961	3692042	It's fuchsia!
3692122	3696906	Are you going to argue with me about colors now?
3696966	3698047	Come on, it was purple.
3701569	3706012	Everybody knows that it's going to be DDR fuchsia.
3706153	3709535	That's the new... It's like 2DX Red, DDR fuchsia, okay?
3709575	3710436	Trust me on this.
3711388	3712309	I've got to know!
3712569	3713569	Okay, I found the code!
3713589	3715990	Can we color a little bit less homosexual?
3716030	3716631	Come on!
3717591	3718912	Hey, please!
3719092	3725736	Fine, if you really want to know what the color is, it's super fuchsia, but you know, I'm not one to judge their title, okay?
3725836	3726276	I don't get it.
3726616	3727176	No, no.
3727516	3730138	Because the homosexual one would be fabulous fuchsia.
3734205	3737488	I hope so too I hope he is, but I unfortunately don't think he is in this case
3759577	3764159	I haven't heard anyone else say otherwise, so Loki's the first one to say something wrong.
3764499	3765759	When he says it, he says it loud.
3765799	3766560	Don't let that scare you.
3768220	3768600	Alright.
3768780	3770081	Alright, well thanks for the tip, Sherlock.
3770221	3771801	How are you doing otherwise?
3774282	3775603	Life's had its ups and downs.
3778273	3779253	How's DDR in New York?
3779413	3781554	We don't hear a whole lot about what's going on in New York.
3781834	3783754	Oh God, don't get me started.
3784314	3785035	Don't get me started.
3785055	3787415	We had to lock the forums like two weeks back.
3787496	3789996	I'm not talking about the interweb drama.
3790016	3790937	The interweb?
3791877	3792917	How's the scene going?
3793457	3794738	The scene itself?
3795758	3797159	Not much better, I'll give you that.
3797439	3798199	Oh, that's a bummer.
3799439	3804101	Go out there with some defibrillators and breathe some life into DDR a little bit.
3805240	3806201	It's not changing.
3806241	3807962	Nothing's changed around here at all.
3808082	3810604	Sherlock, go spread the Santa rumor all around.
3810624	3811265	They'll all buy it.
3811345	3811845	I will.
3811885	3812345	I will.
3812405	3813046	I'm going to.
3813146	3813746	Alright, you do that.
3814507	3814827	Yeah.
3815248	3816869	Alright, thanks for calling, Sherlock.
3816909	3817309	Have a good one.
3818330	3818750	You too.
3818810	3819110	Later.
3819130	3820271	I heard it here first.
3820832	3821552	Wait, hold on.
3822113	3822873	What?
3822913	3825215	I said you heard it here first, DDR Fuchsia.
3828246	3848762	Alright, DDR Fuchsia Well, I'm glad Sherlock decided to call the show Even if he may be chasing a ghost Not unlike one of our co-hosts here on the show No, he's just chasing nothing Sorry It's been there, okay?
3848822	3851564	It's been there forever Ever and ever
3853203	3853963	You still look grinch.
3854324	3854624	Alright.
3856525	3857845	Anyway, moving on.
3857865	3860747	I want to do a little bit of a follow-up to something we were talking about last week.
3861807	3864809	Jamie, this has to do with something you brought up, and it's the girl...
3865319	3871062	The Little Girl That Killed The Other Little Girl, and now has the internet obsession going on about her?
3871122	3872342	Yeah, I have a banner for it now.
3872362	3874123	Yeah, I just, I was going to bring that up.
3874704	3882007	The hell possessed you to go and make a banner and imagine, for those that didn't catch last week's show, just a little catch up.
3882027	3883108	I'll put a link to it in the chat room.
3883288	3885649	Okay, give us this Cliff Notes version.
3885689	3886489	What's going on here?
3887010	3889291	What happened and why is there an internet obsession about it?
3890248	3895211	Okay, there was a girl who killed one of her classmates.
3895712	3901495	In the class picture, this little girl was wearing a University of Nevada sweatshirt.
3901575	3903937	It just says Nevada all the way across, and it's a blue sweatshirt.
3905078	3908680	And there's all indications that they were friends and everything.
3911222	3914124	Anyway, it started this whole big internet obsession.
3915135	3921480	And keep in mind, they're doing her as a character, not as she herself.
3922621	3926884	And because she was 12 years old, they couldn't prosecute her.
3926944	3931147	Because the age of criminal responsibility in Japan is 14.
3931987	3936871	Which was actually lowered to 14 because of another child murder.
3938712	3940634	And there's like tons of fan art now.
3940714	3941975	Tons and tons of fan art.
3942691	3945392	So I took one of the pictures and made a banner out of it.
3946353	3957358	And what I like, you know how when people that want to be fashionable with their banners online, they have the banner and then they have the matching little avatar that goes with it, the little box that sits under the name.
3957799	3966643	What I liked about what Jamie did, not only does she have this going on on DDR Freak, but she has it going on on the Orange Lodge Radio forums as well as probably every other forum out there right now that she frequents.
3967203	3974207	She's got the little banner that has the little Nevada girl on it and it says DarkSakura and then the little avatar is a little box cutter.
3974227	3982651	It's actually from the same picture because I wanted to get the whole thing of her holding the box cutter but the size didn't reduce the way I liked it to.
3983111	3987033	So I said just her holding the box cutter and I'm going to post it in the chat room.
3988061	3988681	Alright, you do that.
3988701	3989442	You post it in chat.
3989902	3991682	Or, you can check it out for yourself.
3991722	3996984	Just go to the Orange Lounge Radio forums and there should be a post from Jamie in there.
3997024	4002686	I have to give a cheap advertisement in there somewhere for people to visit our dying forums.
4003727	4005307	Alright.
4005327	4008768	I want the quote thread to evolve.
4008928	4016151	In order for the quote thread to come back, people have to actually use our chat room, don't you think?
4017594	4020337	Angel is mouthing that right along with me like I was at the Rocky Horror Picture Show or something.
4020357	4021297	He's just mouthing it along.
4039232	4041596	I'm sad that you quit, just so you know.
4049423	4050364	Well, you know what?
4050604	4052506	How about for Christmas you pay for me to play again?
4052846	4053606	I'm kidding.
4054707	4055988	Yeah, how about that gift card?
4056028	4058510	How about that pooping reindeer?
4058530	4062153	You know, I actually did have half of the temptation to reinstall it.
4063615	4064295	Temptation's good.
4064555	4066157	And then I thought, why?
4066597	4067498	I won't have time.
4068498	4071581	You know, once the school year starts again, once the semester starts.
4071641	4074283	When you get really addicted like me, you make time.
4075124	4076345	That's what I have the gem for.
4078487	4078967	Oh, snap.
4079483	4081425	That's my addiction, is exercise.
4082106	4083467	My addiction is feeling fit.
4084788	4087371	Well, I like endorphins.
4087411	4090774	You need to take me to the gym sometime, because I want to see what this is all about.
4091134	4091454	Okay.
4092796	4093136	Sometime.
4094497	4095999	Let's have ourselves a cage match, shall we?
4098621	4098961	Why not?
4098981	4099342	Why not?
4100419	4106783	Alright, the way the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match works, we play three songs for you guys, and you guys pick your favorite song.
4107143	4110405	The winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio.
4111106	4118010	Each host picks a song, and you get to hear a clip of last week's winner, as well as two brand new songs.
4118670	4121852	Last week in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, it came down to The Wire.
4122273	4123513	It was incredibly insane.
4123553	4126115	It was a three-way tie.
4126535	4130818	A three-way tie, and it was three new songs because we had to retire a song last week.
4131619	4139184	So DDR Angel ended up breaking the tie, and a lot of folks in the chat room are very passionate about their dislike for this song.
4139644	4142947	So it's going to have a hard time holding on tonight, but we'll see.
4143783	4144303	We'll see.
4144423	4148485	Maybe people will see something in the song tonight that they didn't see before.
4148605	4150066	I don't know, but here it is.
4150146	4151747	Song number one you can vote for tonight.
4152447	4156249	It's the artist called J-Punch and the song is called Bitch.
4156629	4156989	Enjoy.
4157009	4171116	And I hate myself
4172984	4175430	And I tried You're a bitch, you're a
4277931	4280432	All right, that was song number one in tonight's cage match.
4281252	4283293	Bitch by J-Punch.
4284653	4289275	And looks like the chat room is about ready to take their handguns to that song.
4290075	4291116	They're bitching!
4291136	4292356	Yeah, they're bitching.
4293537	4294977	You're so funny, Jamie!
4295537	4295817	All right.
4297978	4301259	Let's see what's going to try and knock this bitch out of here tonight.
4301279	4303020	We'll start it off with DarkSakura's pick.
4304235	4305475	I picked an overclocked mix.
4306316	4312758	This is good because we were talking about overclocked a little bit last week and how Loki is going to submit his remix any day now, right?
4313458	4314439	Uh, no I'm not actually.
4315379	4316359	Oh, what caused this change?
4316379	4317160	Hold on, hold on.
4318760	4319581	What caused the change?
4320641	4325363	It doesn't, it's not, no, it's not the type of remix to be on that site.
4325423	4326543	Sorry, that's it, period.
4327403	4328984	No discussion, it's not going up there.
4329884	4331465	He is not going to compromise his art.
4333061	4334902	Anyway, back to what we were talking about here.
4335242	4337704	I just realized there's a lot of crap on Overclocked, though.
4338324	4341005	A lot of really crappy remixes.
4341025	4342046	But not this song, right?
4342146	4342286	No.
4342586	4346268	This one's a remix from Raiden 2, which is one of my favorite shooter games of all time.
4347209	4352392	Actually, my favorite in the series is Raiden DX, but Raiden 2 was the first one that had these electric things.
4352952	4361597	It's like this big purple line that shoots out and latches onto people and zooms around them, and I was like, that was the coolest weapon in a shooting game ever.
4362117	4364479	Next to the Fist in Twinbee.
4365220	4366641	So I had to download that.
4366661	4368203	And it actually turned out to be a pretty cool one.
4368243	4372386	So I don't remember the name that they named it, but it's something from Raiden 2.
4373067	4373728	I'll give you a hint.
4373748	4379553	The artist is Tefnek, and the song is called the Raiden 2 Airborne Overclock Mix.
4379733	4380294	How's that sound?
4381164	4381525	Raiden.
4382005	4382245	All right.
4382366	4382746	Oops, sorry.
4382846	4383247	Raiden.
4383447	4387552	I keep thinking Mortal Kombat since Raiden or Fatal Fury for that same spelling.
4388153	4388493	All right.
4388994	4389435	Here it is.
4390015	4392879	Tefnek Raiden 2 Airborne OC Remix.
4392919	4393219	Enjoy.
4397099	4398260	Thanks for watching!
4577242	4580668	Thanks for watching!
4666849	4672834	Okay, song number two in tonight's cage match was Teth Neck, Raiden II, Airborne.
4672874	4674516	It's a remix coming to you from Overclocked.
4675116	4679059	Let's see if that song overclocked or underclocked with the judges here in the room.
4679099	4679780	What do you think, Jamie?
4680260	4685204	Well, I liked it, obviously, or else I wouldn't have picked it, so it gets a nine for me.
4685765	4686566	All right, fair enough.
4687086	4687406	Loki?
4687426	4690309	I think I've heard it before, actually.
4690329	4691330	It gets an eight.
4694292	4694672	Arcadian 42.
4696949	4698010	I liked it, I'll give it an 8
4714136	4723704	I thought the song was, it was very fluffy, flying on the clouds type thing, I don't know if it's the song I'd go like, yeah, rock on, this song, but it's cute.
4724204	4729268	It's definitely video game ambience type music, so I'd give it like a, nah, an 8, why not.
4730989	4732150	Now we can hear you, Arcadian.
4732450	4733691	Alright, where would you give that one?
4733751	4734332	It was alright.
4734892	4735673	I'll give it an 8.
4736448	4738129	All right, and 8 from Arcadian as well.
4738469	4739570	Remember, though, it's not up to us.
4739610	4743392	It's up to you guys in the chat room at www.orangelandre.com and chat.
4743432	4744473	You guys get the final say.
4744993	4746194	Loki, it's your turn.
4746234	4748195	What song did you pick for us tonight?
4748215	4751537	I'm going to give them a second try.
4752158	4759182	This is Monolithic with House of Joy off of their newest CD, Diving Descenders.
4760549	4763762	Alright, one more time, giving them a try here in the cage match.
4763842	4765870	Monolithic, House of Joy.
4765970	4766211	Enjoy.
5124497	5140160	All right, that was song number three in tonight's cage match.
5140200	5141740	Monolithic with House of Joy.
5141800	5146061	Let's go around and see if that was House of Joy or House of Pain to people.
5146401	5147662	House of Pain was cool.
5148302	5149042	All right, let's see.
5149082	5149842	Starting off with Jamie.
5150529	5154592	That guy, okay, I'm sorry, if you're going to be a professional, learn how to hold a fucking key.
5155633	5155973	Wow.
5157194	5157594	I know.
5158035	5161957	He falls, this guy falls into the same category as Politary.
5162378	5164159	Cannot hold a key.
5164960	5165340	Okay?
5166381	5172225	Um, the music was good, but the guy's voice sucked ass, so I'll split the difference and give it a six.
5172785	5174927	Alright, let's go around to the other side.
5175467	5176028	Uh, Loki.
5176048	5176128	Okay.
5178584	5181125	It gets a 10 because I've been playing this song for over a month.
5182325	5184585	And if it's that good for me to listen to, then it gets a 10.
5186406	5188446	And he does hold a key, he holds goth key.
5188686	5191127	And that's goth key, I guess.
5194888	5196088	The voice doesn't really bother me.
5196488	5197448	I think it's cool.
5197888	5199088	And I like the music a lot.
5199208	5200869	Let's give it a 9 from me.
5201209	5201429	Angel.
5203638	5204958	I like his stuff a lot.
5205538	5207339	I had tonight.
5210440	5213060	And let's see what we thought, Arcadian42.
5213140	5215921	It was okay, I'll give it 6.5.
5216621	5216901	Alright.
5217561	5221262	So remember, it's not up to us, it's up to you.
5221362	5225223	So let's review the songs you can vote for in tonight's cage match.
5225263	5230084	Starting off with song number one, last week's winner, Bitch by J-Punch.
5243579	5250746	Alright, and song number two in tonight's cage match was Raiden 2, Airborne, Overclocked Mix.
5261997	5266201	And song number three in tonight's cage match was Monolithic, House of Joy.
5276395	5278016	All right, guys, you know the drill.
5278076	5280117	Place vote now.
5280237	5285079	Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.
5286019	5293662	Joining us late during the cage match, as he always likes to join us, say hello to Explicit, real name Jonas.
5294463	5294903	Hello.
5295103	5295563	How you doing?
5296463	5296904	Doing fine.
5296924	5298944	Just came back from the SVGL3 tournament.
5298984	5300185	Well, not just now, right?
5300305	5300865	Yesterday.
5301165	5303926	I was going to say, if you just got back now, you were there a little late.
5303966	5305167	You know what ended yesterday, right?
5305694	5306154	Dude, I was there.
5306174	5308316	I had to compete.
5308636	5309116	I got a note.
5309176	5309857	None of us went.
5309957	5313039	I was really hoping to go, but I got lazy.
5313679	5316201	And because of my trip, I got really badly burned out.
5316501	5317642	But nobody noticed I was gone.
5317702	5323246	But at the same time, just keep in mind that the hype wasn't really worth all that hype.
5323386	5323626	I know.
5323806	5325147	When you talk about the hype, what do you mean?
5325727	5330130	You know how everybody says, oh, it's SVGL, the biggest tournament in history.
5330150	5331691	You got SVGL.
5331731	5333413	I think, when was the first SVGL?
5333433	5333853	Do you remember?
5333873	5333953	Yeah.
5335697	5339759	First SVGL was, I don't know, a long time ago.
5339779	5346302	I know SVGL 2 was 2002, in April, I suppose.
5347242	5351364	And SVGL is December 2004, the third installment.
5351564	5355686	So it was the last in a long line of events then.
5355866	5358667	Yeah, supposedly the biggest tournament ever.
5359408	5359708	Okay.
5361028	5362329	Depending on how people's opinions are.
5364482	5373430	But all I gotta say is the big, well I'll explain later if you have any questions Not so far, I'm curious kind of what happened, how did the day go?
5374832	5387383	Well it was a very very long day, the PA took, PA really I think started at 11.45 for the qualifiers I think the PA ended at 6 o'clock itself, it took that long
5389161	5392263	because there was some controversy with the pads.
5392283	5393003	Some people were complaining.
5393023	5394083	Okay, what is this controversy?
5394123	5398285	Because I've heard about it over on DDR Freak, on the forums.
5398345	5408090	They said, because they switched, I think they switched the pads from 4th Plus or into Groove, whatever they switched the cabinet to for the Extreme.
5409111	5413273	And they said that one player's side is not working or I'm not really sure what's going on there.
5413973	5415994	Someone said that this guy was a sore loser or...
5416978	5421302	The pads were really not working, depending on what you guys' opinions or different playstyles.
5421963	5425185	I can't really opinionize on that, but it delayed a shitload of time.
5425926	5426467	Unnecessary.
5427147	5436455	Unfortunately, I've noticed this is kind of a trend in a lot of tournaments lately, where somebody's complaining about the pad, and then they have to do these extensive tests on it to see if they're working or not.
5437316	5440319	My advice to future people who are going to be throwing tournaments...
5441359	5452410	to have some kind of conflict resolution thing in the tournament rules that says, if there's a question, this is the procedure, and whatever the outcome of that procedure is, end of story.
5452470	5452990	No arguing.
5453711	5461618	I really learned a lot with the SVGL3 tournament organizing, even though many have actually said that it was very badly organized.
5462279	5465522	Regardless if it's true or not, I would say it's badly organized because of the
5466164	5467104	Time restraints.
5467864	5472226	I think 2DX took way too long, even though there was like 5 people who competed for 2DX.
5473246	5474326	The only 5 people?
5474886	5475706	Yeah, 2DX for it.
5475766	5479947	I'm assuming 5 or 8, but it took way too long for its own type.
5480648	5482668	Usually that's too fast for 8 people.
5484189	5486489	But if it was like 32, it would take long, obviously.
5487509	5489230	But yeah, around that much competed.
5490030	5490850	It wasn't that many people.
5492331	5493751	And freestyle started hella late.
5495013	5498294	Not to mention the lack of room for people to actually compete on.
5498354	5499555	It was too crowded inside.
5500335	5502195	People had to sit down for the camera.
5502595	5505896	It was all stuffed near the machines that have a lot of sound.
5506377	5508517	Spiegel is a very interesting place to have a tournament.
5508537	5509998	Do they have the machine inside?
5510498	5510838	Yeah.
5510898	5512659	How in the hell were you able to see anything?
5513039	5515239	Well, like I said, it wasn't really worth the hype.
5515920	5516480	I see.
5516860	5519841	Because the management itself is also involved.
5520281	5523342	They refuse to do certain things and certain expectations to...
5524835	5525875	to us competitors.
5527656	5534418	One is, yeah, of course, not everybody is satisfied, but at least come to a point where everybody agrees in a way.
5536138	5537619	I know Team Seattle was there.
5537799	5538659	Right, I heard about that.
5538679	5539679	SoCal was there.
5540059	5542200	Some of the Sacramento people were there, like Toadie.
5542240	5546041	Yeah, I was kind of hoping he'd come tonight because I wanted to talk to him about it because he competed.
5546081	5548842	Yeah, and I competed.
5548862	5548922	Ugh.
5551999	5553380	What was that arc for?
5553640	5578816	Because the rules kind of got altered in a way, I wasn't really sure if that was the rules because there was a qualifier list in SVGL3 I'm assuming, many people have thought it was going to be practicing one of the following songs like Highs Off You, Superstar, etc, etc, etc But I chose one of the, all of the things called Extratuned Some people may have fucked up on it, well I fucked up on it For some reason, it's not one of my greats in the beginning
5579435	5583696	Some people were okay with that, but some people were not really happy with the rules there.
5585017	5586277	But then again, it's a competition.
5586297	5587397	You don't want to start drama.
5587797	5591599	Do the drama during the forums, but not during the tournaments.
5591839	5594740	That's where the forums come in the after to see what they can do better.
5596020	5599601	Even though 50% of the control is basically on SVGL's part.
5601380	5602181	So how did freestyle go?
5602221	5605743	I heard freestyle was really good, that there were a lot of really high-level people.
5605763	5607884	Well, I can't really opinionize that.
5607904	5611146	There were some ups and downs with freestyle.
5611526	5615529	Well, the ups was it was a good competition, great competition, great competitors competed.
5615809	5624014	Like Tequila from Omaha came all the way from there to the Bay just to compete.
5624874	5628777	Turned out very good, and some of the performances showed a lot of hard work.
5629177	5629377	Mm-hmm.
5630943	5638470	In a way, especially with finals, why the hell are you going to place a fucking tournament right after college finals?
5639110	5642113	Well, because they don't want to do it on Christmas.
5642233	5646997	I mean, you could find a problem with almost any week that you could possibly pick, I think.
5647497	5654603	Well, because I thought SVGL was supposed to be held during the summer, which was a predicted thing, but Christmas?
5654983	5658086	Like, right before Christmas, it's finals, people are stressing out over it.
5658581	5687326	Freestyle section, they can't do a routine because because freestyle in my opinion was too limited for that whole day because right after finals you have to work on a routine it's a big pain in the ass especially when I had finals like two or some people had finals like two like two of them on Friday and they had to work immediate without sleep just to make sure it looks good but the biggest problem with the the environment of the freestyle is that they didn't put outside
5687881	5710270	Give a lot of air conditioning And of course the place itself wasn't even air conditioned And the second of all, very limited space You got people crowding all over the pad So people wanted to do a lot of movement outside the pad But they were limited because they got people around Blocking their... Even my routine got fucked over How so?
5710950	5717533	Because it required at least 3 to 5 feet of open space on my right side When I was competing
5718101	5726527	Now, was it supposedly going to happen that there was going to be the machine outside?
5726567	5728789	Was that ever said that was possible?
5728929	5733492	Well, SPGL2 had... Yeah, but I can see where in the winter there might be rain concerns, too.
5733653	5737515	I mean, because then imagine if it had rained and they tried to put the machine outside, it would have been even more cramped.
5738456	5742679	No, I mean, the weather itself was not to a point where it was about to rain.
5744864	5748505	Besides, I already checked the weather and SVGL beforehand so I know what the hell's going on.
5748625	5748845	Right.
5749165	5752546	Even though, of course, the weather is not really 100% accurate.
5753427	5758468	But at the same time... But here's another problem with the situation with the freestyle conditions.
5759708	5762969	You got extreme near the 4th Plus machine.
5763690	5769411	So you're either going to probably be hearing extreme songs and 4th Plus at the same time conflicting with your concentration on the routine.
5769491	5769892	Oh, ouch.
5770312	5770572	Okay.
5770632	5774493	So you might be hearing like... They didn't turn one off or anything?
5775495	5781360	No, for some reason the extreme was a little louder than, um, friggin', um... Fourth Plus?
5781600	5784262	Yeah, and you got the 2DX written almost nearby, too.
5784362	5785483	Was In The Groove involved, too?
5786024	5789527	No, no, the In The Groove machine got switched with Fourth Plus.
5789967	5791228	Gotcha, okay, gotcha.
5791368	5798554	So you got... Yeah, regardless, I still have not played In The Groove, so I can't really opinionize with these steps on In The Groove.
5799095	5801297	That would have been interesting, though, if that was, uh...
5802410	5804653	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5815546	5816167	Well, yeah.
5816587	5817528	That's controversial.
5817548	5819829	I can't really say anything because I've never tested the thing.
5820090	5820370	Right.
5820510	5821971	And of course, everything's a matter of opinion.
5822131	5827135	I'm kind of surprised nobody took that opportunity, though, to do something with in the groove.
5827475	5830658	Kind of, I don't know, like having to pick the West Coast.
5831358	5832119	They only have two cabinets.
5832219	5833220	They only have two cabinets.
5833280	5840526	And of course, like, you got SVGL, CVGL, RV, not RVGL, well, sort of the way RVGL, MGL.
5840546	5842327	They're all golfers.
5842347	5843968	They have to share machines with each other in a way.
5844008	5844208	Right.
5844769	5844949	Right.
5845137	5856205	Especially in the barrier, which is very... Of course, you know, like, MGL got the Pump It Up Exceed from SVGL and probably in the groove from SVGL.
5856265	5858206	I'm not really sure if that's true or not.
5859587	5862469	Or if both places have this in the groove.
5864190	5864551	Interesting.
5865391	5866292	Yeah, let's see.
5866632	5869934	2DX... Oh, did you want to hear about the results?
5869994	5872056	Yeah, what happened with the 2DX turning?
5872616	5873677	Well, I really didn't really...
5874417	5881262	See what's with 2DX, but I've heard that a lot of people complaining about how 2DX Red was off-sync as shit.
5883284	5885346	Yes, it's like, think of it as night style.
5885666	5889829	I'm not sure if it's not... That's what the fucking game is, they gotta get used to it.
5891130	5892211	They're off-sync.
5892812	5895714	No, I'm not sure if it's that, or if it's the hardware, I'm not sure, cause...
5896724	5897644	Some people were complaining with that.
5898044	5898985	I really couldn't complain.
5899065	5906506	Either I had the worst accuracy or on 2DX, because I played myself, and I got a good attack the whole song.
5907187	5908607	And this is on a red, was it on a red?
5908627	5908967	Red.
5909067	5909487	Oh, wow.
5909607	5912048	Yes, the new red Deliver Style.
5912748	5913288	Wow.
5913808	5914968	Drool, get a boner.
5916869	5925031	But I'm not sure if it's really, but since RVGL's getting one, I'm not sure if that's going to be, if it's the hardware problems that people are saying or the software problems itself.
5925231	5925411	Hmm.
5926859	5931072	Only time will tell what's the truth if it's off.
5933599	5936440	Is there any questions with the FBGL tournament?
5936580	5937240	I don't know.
5937740	5939381	Nothing I haven't gotten on there and read myself.
5939401	5943022	I just kind of feel bad that I wasn't really able to go to the tournament because I really wanted to go.
5943062	5946743	But then at the same time, it sounded like it was really crowded as hell and not a lot of standing room.
5946823	5952564	And if I wasn't entering, maybe... Well, there was some drama involved as well.
5953184	5953825	What's the drama?
5953845	5954485	Tell us about drama.
5956105	5957426	I'll get to the FBs on that one.
5957606	5957946	No, no, no.
5957986	5958466	I want to know now.
5959709	5963512	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5978806	5980927	Oh, well, how old is DDR Bot?
5981067	5981708	He's 11 years old.
5984710	5988192	So, basically, he's resorting to an 11-year-old's immaturity to pick on the 11-year-old.
5988872	5989533	Just curious, all right?
5989633	5990914	Yes, well, yeah, you got that.
5991014	5991614	Okay, okay.
5992875	5993575	Birds of a feather.
5994156	6000039	Of course you got the complaints of the pads, whether or not it's SVGL sport or if it's the people being so loser.
6000159	6000780	Who started it?
6002641	6003661	I can't get involved.
6003962	6004522	All right, all right.
6005163	6008444	Some people drooling over DDR Player's girlfriend.
6008824	6011645	I have to ask the hard-hitting questions of this program, alright?
6011685	6013565	I want to know, who started this shit?
6013805	6015245	Who cast the first stone?
6015826	6017146	Who's the drama starter?
6017186	6019146	Who is their fan in the flames?
6020327	6026148	I can't really... I don't really know exactly, but it has something to do with SoCal and Team Seattle.
6027839	6034966	which is a long going back and forth that's happened for a long, long time so that's again, not a surprise, alright.
6035467	6043194	Err, I'm not sure what happened but they said it was JSP versus some girl in Team Seattle, JSP won that one but for some reason he dropped out of the race.
6045036	6052143	For either attraction or sexually attractive reasons or
6052543	6059206	Was it Tanya, the girl that's always on, because I know she was going, the girl that was the get up move girl?
6059786	6060526	I'm not really sure.
6061107	6062427	If I remember correctly reading this.
6062607	6064068	I read this briefly, I think.
6064128	6067689	It was the chick that was the one that was on MTV promoting DDR.
6067829	6070250	I didn't know there was anyone on MTV promoting DDR.
6070270	6070730	What the hell?
6070750	6071831	I don't even know about that.
6071891	6077713	Yes, actually, Tanya was on the, what is it, the 20 games of the year thing or something.
6077733	6079254	Oh, yeah, I've heard about that.
6079294	6080715	They shot stuff around Seattle.
6080755	6081535	Yeah, okay, so...
6081795	6082595	I heard about that.
6082795	6083576	Alright, so.
6084096	6089278	Oh yeah, for the winners of PEA, one of the first places, of course, Team Seattle.
6090298	6095120	Second was Fidox, who actually came to the FU tournament and the August.
6095280	6095981	Okay, good deal.
6096201	6097041	So that was very good.
6098422	6101963	Third place, I don't remember third place, but I know the top two.
6102063	6102923	Alright, back to drama.
6102983	6104264	Was there any good freestyle drama?
6106297	6107538	Well, the limited room of space.
6107558	6109360	Of course, I already told you about the freestyle drama.
6110060	6112162	The limited amount of room of space.
6112282	6114084	I have to know, I have to know.
6114444	6115545	Did anybody get served?
6117386	6117847	In what way?
6119728	6122271	Did anybody do their routine and go, you got served?
6122811	6123011	No.
6123672	6124392	Nobody got served?
6125213	6125453	No.
6125994	6126434	I had to know.
6126474	6128876	Because people were just waiting for freestyle to start.
6128896	6131879	It took too long for everybody else to fucking...
6132762	6133543	Get freestyle prepared.
6133583	6134083	I think it started at 8.30.
6134323	6135404	That was too late.
6135424	6136345	Everybody's tired.
6136465	6136845	Oh, shit.
6136885	6139327	I could have gone to Spiggle if I knew it was going to go that way.
6140168	6141248	But at the same time, though.
6141268	6146032	I mean, the condition, it was too... It was just too hot inside and limited space.
6146132	6147173	You can't really do anything.
6147593	6154438	It's like pointing your fingers upwards, just not moving your whole body and taking advantage of the whole freestyle.
6154658	6155699	Okay, were there any fistfights?
6156740	6157701	No, there were no... Shouting matches?
6158061	6158221	Huh?
6158861	6159442	Knives drawn?
6159462	6159502	No.
6160598	6161639	No, no, no.
6161819	6162880	But I heard... Oh, yeah.
6163460	6165522	Okay, I was just reading the forum.
6165562	6167604	Some people are saying, damn Fab Five.
6167664	6172888	It does have something to do with throwing a football at an 11-year-old's head.
6172928	6174089	Wait, Fab Five?
6174769	6181355	Carson and Tom and Gann and all them were there?
6181415	6182435	They're my idols, man.
6182475	6185278	I'm not sure what the hell is going on with this drama and shit.
6186118	6187980	But, you know, this drama exists and...
6189223	6194406	And people are serving other people and it's just, you know, servolution.
6194526	6199768	Then you got boyfriend-girlfriend conflicts with other men or other women, whatever the hell you say it's.
6200829	6204651	Well, this should be interesting because one of the, I think one of the NorCal people,
6205831	6206852	We'll say, where is this?
6207412	6210695	Uh-uh, uh-uh, okay, uh-uh, no, uh-uh, uh-uh.
6210755	6213697	He is not sleeping with my boyfriend, okay?
6213837	6215618	Okay, now, uh-uh, it's not going to happen.
6215838	6218059	Okay, I'm going to serve you right now, okay?
6218580	6219640	Well, here's the thing.
6219720	6220281	How was that?
6220781	6221121	I don't know.
6221181	6224203	Well, what's funny is that... That was my, like, Texas slash ghetto.
6224384	6225484	It was my Texas ghetto.
6226885	6231068	I don't understand this drama, but this is one of the funniest questions I've ever... One of the funniest questions...
6231701	6236646	I've been asked to me, why is this hot Asian girl going out with old Joe Dirt?
6238888	6243933	And I think this one guy actually liked this... Did anyone actually see the movie Joe Dirt?
6245274	6247977	There's a hot chick dating Joe Dirt, I mean...
6250077	6250737	What the hell?
6251298	6255980	Yeah, that was a response I got from one of the people, saying, ooh, this girl is hot.
6256440	6260062	See, I know something like this is gonna happen, so... Oh my god, he tricked the Asian!
6260402	6261503	He must be super genius!
6263404	6263864	Anyway, sorry.
6264204	6266605	Oh yeah, and I did actually talk to some gay guy.
6266785	6267786	An actual gay person.
6268086	6268526	Oh my god!
6268686	6270427	Oh my god, they exist?
6270947	6273709	Wait, you actually saw a gay person?
6274109	6276830	Yes, I've actually talked to a gay person in a tournament.
6277610	6278711	He's like you, Robb.
6279517	6279917	Oh dear.
6280618	6283040	He's like you, Ron, but gay.
6283500	6284541	Wait, what, what, what, Loki?
6284841	6285942	He's like you, Ron, but gay.
6288144	6292427	I'm not gay, I just... Whoa, whoa, whoa, I thought you... You just pull in on the radio.
6292967	6294969	Yeah, this is just my radio personality, okay?
6295489	6298091	Yeah, pussy, I'm all about the pussy, man.
6298151	6300173	Tips, yeah, that's all I want right now.
6300293	6305077	Big, big, big... I can't do it.
6305577	6306818	I'm gayer than Judy Garland.
6306878	6308079	I can't hold it anymore.
6308720	6311021	Well, perhaps you and that gay guy would have a good match.
6312282	6315103	And if he plays DDR, he's probably under 18, so not a good idea.
6316704	6319626	Yeah, he's over 18, but I'm not sure if he plays DDR or anything like that.
6320086	6322007	An actual, living, breathing gay person?
6322727	6322927	Yes.
6323308	6323648	Okay.
6323888	6324428	Just curious.
6324668	6324989	Wait, wait, wait.
6325409	6329891	Well, therefore, because I'm gay and this other person's gay, we have to have sex, obviously.
6331492	6332913	Did they capture him in nets?
6333433	6337155	You know, okay, because if one of the gays is running around, then, you know...
6338140	6340341	You don't want that stuff spreading.
6340401	6341902	Well, he does act gay.
6341922	6343063	He actually says he was gay.
6344284	6348306	He's like, as he's bent over some dude, yeah, I'm gay.
6352408	6352769	Oh, man.
6353209	6353449	Sorry.
6353469	6354970	No, that's all right.
6355890	6356511	But, yes.
6356651	6360513	Well, I'm glad you could finally meet a gay person.
6361194	6362154	That's for you, Skye.
6362614	6363335	All right, thank you.
6365149	6366629	All right, moving on.
6366669	6369590	Let's go and talk about, because the chat room is getting restless.
6369610	6374492	They're going... How long have they been having this conversation?
6375352	6376652	No, Loki, I want to go to break.
6376752	6378033	Oh, yeah, where's SVGL?
6378053	6379073	It's near MGL.
6379193	6379833	Problem solved.
6381173	6382914	SVGL is in the Bay Area.
6383034	6384414	It's in southern Bay Area.
6384434	6386575	Actually, it's a 20-minute drive or...
6388656	6393358	If you know where MGL is, it's basically... If you don't know where it is, it's near San Jose, California, basically.
6393618	6394158	It's simple.
6394478	6396979	The easy... Because remember, we're an international program.
6396999	6400161	Just drive three simple steps to drive to Milpitas.
6400681	6407904	Go to I-80, then go to 680, then exit where you'll see... El Camino, Real.
6408044	6409925	That's SVGL, talking about MGL.
6411646	6413787	SVGL takes a little longer to get to, though.
6414467	6415428	And there's gay people there.
6416690	6416950	Yes.
6418211	6425053	Just start, you know what, just get in your car and start driving towards the Madonna music and you'll end up in Spiegel soon enough.
6425553	6428274	You'll see the giant rainbow sign in the air.
6430175	6431135	You know they're all tagged.
6434296	6437878	And they've got like, you know those tags like pierced on their ears.
6439658	6444020	Alright you bitches, let's hear who won tonight's cage match, shall we?
6445399	6446500	We need to take a break.
6468018	6469080	We're going to go to a break right now.
6470382	6473646	Even though I couldn't find half the songs you wanted to hear in the next break, I did find one.
6473746	6474788	You found Panorama?
6474828	6475729	I did find Panorama.
6476030	6476310	Okay.
6476410	6476951	Alright, here it is.
6477191	6477632	We'll be back.
6526348	6528233	Thank you for watching!
6549665	6551210	Thanks for watching!
6775161	6782647	All that you wish for is to have you Fly and keep on
6828446	6830108	Hi, this is Mel B of RTF.
6830449	6835315	And for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join us on all the fun together.
6836175	6842160	Hey, if you're a broke ass like I am, why don't you come to one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.
6842480	6844382	It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.
6844963	6849046	Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.
6849787	6851288	Hello, we are back.
6852049	6855031	Mel won that freestyle thing with tequila, right?
6855091	6855471	Was that it?
6855491	6856032	Is that how it went?
6856584	6858305	The Freestyle over at Sigl.
6858725	6859965	Mel and Tequila?
6860025	6861286	Mel and Tequila, yeah, they won it.
6861446	6862286	Good job, boys.
6862386	6862626	Good job.
6862646	6864146	Yep, did a very, very good job.
6864226	6870288	It's all worth Tequila's drive and Mel's... He drove from... No, I'm not sure, but I think it's by flight.
6870308	6871549	I was going to say, that's a hell of a drive.
6871569	6871869	By flight.
6872449	6872709	All right.
6873369	6875910	Loki, you said you had some stuff you wanted to talk about tonight with us.
6876150	6876370	What?
6878291	6881352	Yeah, now I want to talk to you because I noticed that you were doing something else.
6881392	6883872	So, of course, I want to distract you from that other thing you were doing.
6884352	6891893	If you want to join our chatroom, www.orangeloungeradio.com Come complain about the cage match picks with everybody else there in our chatroom.
6893494	6897214	Again, we also have mini-programming that goes on during the week.
6898134	6900535	Monday nights, Diversion, the Orange Lounge Radio Remix show.
6900595	6904135	Tuesday nights, Pump Up the Volume with the one and only DarkSakura.
6904635	6904856	Yes.
6905556	6907436	And Thursday nights, Outside the Box with me,
6909671	6909891	Who?
6910311	6910512	Me.
6911392	6911632	Who?
6911672	6911873	Me.
6912073	6912293	Who?
6912353	6912693	Myself.
6912793	6913614	Rob and I. Rob.
6913754	6913954	What?
6914034	6914214	Rob.
6914234	6914414	What?
6914655	6914835	What?
6914955	6915095	What?
6915135	6915275	What?
6915295	6915435	What?
6916456	6926964	Alright, and Friday night over on DDR Freak Radio, relive the magic of Orange Challenge Radio Sunday nights as DDR Freak Radio rebroadcasts our Sunday night program at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.
6927584	6928185	Loki, what's up?
6930386	6933028	Well, um, sim stuff.
6933849	6935170	Um, basically...
6936328	6941331	DDR Maniacs has been down for a while now, so no new theme stuff.
6944533	6951077	Anyways, there was a couple turnouts going on that I don't care about, but anyways.
6951097	6955520	The first one that should be mentioned, well, I guess that would be the first one.
6956158	6966161	Turnimix 5+, which is called the re-Turnimix, which I didn't really read the rules, but it sounds like it's just taking old songs from the Turnimix 1 through 5 and redoing them.
6966301	6966641	Big deal.
6967042	6968242	Okay, so that's going on right now.
6968282	6969542	You can find all the information you want.
6971403	6974744	Okay, so it's basically like the flashback episode of your favorite sitcom.
6974784	6977645	It's the same old shit with a different laugh track.
6979946	6980366	Yeah.
6980386	6980466	Yeah.
6980990	6981750	So there's that.
6981810	6987633	Then there's DDR OSC 3+, the original Stepfile Contest.
6988193	6989534	This is remixed, basically.
6990595	7004061	The rules for this is it has to be a song, a remix of a song that's been used in DDR Tourney Mix, a remix of a song that's been used in OSC, or an overclocked remix that hasn't been used in either one, or an original...
7004907	7008808	Remix of a song that's in a non-music game, you know, base game.
7008948	7013069	So, no DDR remixes, but, you know, remixes of other crap is okay.
7014109	7015729	And the due date for this is the 28th.
7016449	7018470	All your information can be found on the MyStyle.
7018510	7021790	There's links to the OSC homepage and all that wonderful crap.
7022351	7026831	And, um, other than that, still stuff's being worked on for the, you know, the Sinfile releases.
7027272	7034613	Now, one of the things I thought was funny that I'd like to mention was we've had our very first, very first, um,
7036070	7036791	Circus de Soleil
7051038	7053099	and then Cirque du Soleil.
7054619	7055559	Oh, my mistake.
7055759	7071963	Well, anyways, they actually came after Bomani Stealth for having, I guess, some of their music on their site, which should be surprising because any of their music actually being out there on the internet, why the fuck anyone want to listen to it level and make a remix or a, not remix, a sim file for that?
7072023	7072343	I don't know.
7073363	7075884	What I want to know is how the fuck did someone find that?
7077438	7077738	I don't know.
7078118	7083621	Anyways, so they got the Seasoned Assist for that thing, but everything else is going as planned.
7083641	7085582	But I just thought that was funny that that would be on there.
7086562	7089564	Other than that, really nothing else going on.
7090924	7099408	So just those two little tournaments there that we really don't have that much to notice for, and well, whatever.
7101309	7103911	A comment in our chatroom I'd like some discussion on.
7104291	7105771	Tournamix is shit.
7106292	7106692	Disgust.
7108755	7110096	I just really don't care anymore.
7110396	7112318	Nobody gives a shit.
7112658	7113459	I don't even remember.
7114300	7117262	I don't look at those as a good indicator.
7117743	7120205	There really aren't that many quality sim files out there anymore.
7121201	7123342	Here's the problem, the pool is way too diluted.
7123863	7126805	As you just said, I didn't follow any of that shit you just said, basically.
7126865	7129867	All I heard was blah blah blah, another contest on blah blah blah, another site.
7130347	7131047	With blah blah blah.
7131267	7134950	And what the fuck, it's a contest based off of other contests, that's kind of weird to me, sorry.
7135510	7141634	But, so basically you've got what, you've got tournaments, and then you have the EI tournament, and then you have this, and then that.
7142114	7144296	Everybody's got a freaking tournament going on right now.
7144336	7147458	It's just like how like two years ago when Extreme was kind of new.
7148198	7150379	Every other week, there was a DDR tournament somewhere.
7150419	7154642	Like, I remember in NorCal, every week for a couple months, there was a tournament somewhere.
7155002	7157943	And it was just like, people did not have the time to come up with freestyle routines.
7158464	7159384	They didn't care anymore.
7159864	7162086	So, I see the same thing happening here.
7162966	7163626	Here's my problem.
7163787	7166048	Okay, and this is the biggest problem that I have with everything.
7166928	7169630	Once FoodMix came out, that set the new standards for me.
7169750	7170670	Nothing can achieve it.
7170750	7171130	I'm sorry.
7171351	7172531	It's just nothing has come close.
7172891	7175173	Nothing will come close until FoodMix releases something else.
7175893	7176633	And that's it.
7176814	7177534	So, you know what?
7177967	7184353	I'm sorry, but there's no Simphile creator out there that can even match that, or even come close to matching that.
7185754	7188677	Even without the yippy hippy background movies.
7189358	7192400	If you were to take the background movies out, would you still feel the same?
7192781	7197485	Because I think background movies is a little much to ask some Joe Schmo in their basement to create.
7197765	7202330	How the hell the Food Mix guys did it, hey, you know what, I don't know, they just had way too much free time.
7203070	7204131	You're very talented, though.
7204151	7206872	I mean, that's really what... Don't get me wrong.
7207552	7209453	The songs are great, and the steps are great.
7209493	7210374	I'm not arguing that.
7210814	7213915	I'm just saying, they've got it all.
7214255	7217937	So, even if you were to remove the videos, would you still say that?
7218177	7218477	Yeah.
7218998	7223900	Even so, the artwork in the background is still phenomenal, and they created their own songs that didn't sound like shit.
7224320	7225441	That was also really good.
7225901	7228342	And the interface, the whole theme was awesome.
7228732	7230073	Just everything about that was awesome.
7230413	7233194	Now, as I see in the chat room, you know, how about the judging?
7233494	7238536	Well, I've been saying it since, what, Tournament Mix, I don't know, 2, 3, 1, I don't know, it doesn't matter.
7239377	7245179	I've been saying they cannot have these sim files labeled by who made them, because you'll never get fair judging for it.
7246008	7248810	What do they do every time they fucking label who they're from?
7248850	7251732	Then they're not voting on SimFile, they're voting for who their favorite person is.
7252953	7261439	And everybody goes straight to download DM Ashura's file, and they go straight to download Moogle Hunter's file, and don't get me wrong, I love Moogle Hunter, he's a local guy, I love him.
7262019	7270826	And what else, they go straight to download Bomani Ruler, Jesus Christ, and they go straight to download whatever, the big people in the SimScenes.
7271386	7272067	And they win!
7272447	7274828	Wait, actually, you can't say that about Moogle Hunter on Terminix 4?
7275769	7276510	Thanks for watching!
7295752	7296273	No, they're not.
7296453	7297794	No, they're not.
7298414	7298975	No, I'm sorry.
7298995	7301317	It gets gone to shit, basically.
7301737	7306521	People just, like, not care, and they just, oh, let's download a song, and let's get a high score of it.
7307302	7308703	Okay, I download personally.
7308863	7311325	I go on, you know, by my style, almost daily.
7311685	7320893	I look on there in their sim files, you know, selection area, and I look and see what remixes are on there, and I listen to every single Max remix on there, every single one that's been made.
7321033	7321193	Wow.
7321213	7321353	Yeah.
7321873	7341779	Okay, I know that's wrong, but I do it, you know, because you know what, there are... Next person to take a Max song and mix it with a Pops A or Pops B song, like Max, I don't know, Max, Mr. Wonderful or whatever, I hope you get laughed off the internet, seriously.
7342019	7344300	Mr. Maxiful or whatever, I hope you get laughed off the internet.
7345066	7347988	Well, someone did make... I think someone did do It's Rennie Max.
7348048	7348929	I'm not really sure that's true.
7348949	7350790	Anyways, anyways, I was gonna... Kill me!
7350810	7352591	I was gonna say, now, now, now.
7352671	7353812	Okay, now I know people.
7354352	7357634	Now, there are good files out there and good songs out there.
7357734	7359355	That's why you have to listen to them all.
7359716	7360096	Because...
7360931	7362112	it might be something good.
7362352	7364453	However, 99% of the time, it's not.
7364473	7364933	It's shit.
7365093	7368795	It's just someone, you know, posting absolute crap on there.
7369215	7377819	But, see, that's what's kind of cool about Bomayusels, they have a little rating system thing, and you can also, you know, put comments about the file, like, this is a piece of shit, you know, that type of thing.
7377879	7378900	Constructive comments.
7379780	7390005	But, uh... Well, actually, I wouldn't say about constructive comments, because, you know, people posting, oh, you stole this, you stole that crap, and then it gets deleted afterwards by a mod.
7392702	7394242	Anyways, whatever.
7394983	7398243	So basically, yeah, there's just not a lot of good shit out there anymore.
7398283	7403765	I'm sorry, FoodMix and Diverse Systems have basically cornered the market in sim files and remixes.
7403865	7405565	So, sorry.
7405585	7410747	Alright, and that's all that's going on in the sim scene right now.
7410787	7411987	It's just a variety of tournaments.
7412227	7413127	You know what, here's an idea.
7414108	7418989	If you want to make your tournament stand out above all the other remixed tournaments, how about throwing some decent prizes?
7419887	7421968	Get some entry fees and some real good prizes.
7422048	7423829	Get some folks to donate some good stuff.
7425190	7427591	Really, what's the best prize you've ever seen for one of these tournaments?
7428531	7428852	Nothing.
7431873	7432433	Case in point.
7432533	7433094	Thank you very much.
7433474	7435615	When do you see the really, really good freestyle routines?
7435655	7437556	When there's a $1,000 pot on the line.
7437856	7439757	When do you see the really shit routines?
7440798	7443219	When it's going to be a pat on the back and a certificate.
7443279	7443679	Good job.
7443699	7444239	You the winner.
7445500	7447061	You winner of tournament.
7449092	7451293	Just a little quick note here.
7451794	7455355	I'd like to mention, Gold Wave is not a remixing program.
7455776	7457817	Do not use it as a remixing program.
7458497	7459978	It is not meant for remixing.
7460138	7461919	It's meant for audio editing.
7462499	7464520	Audio editing does not include remixing.
7464840	7466721	Please, do not use it to remix stuff.
7467141	7470563	Speeding up a song or putting a filter over it does not constitute a remix.
7471063	7472304	Please do not make it a remix.
7472344	7474185	Please do not reverse a song and call it a remix.
7474285	7475245	It's not a remix.
7476766	7477126	Stop.
7477306	7478227	People, please stop.
7481852	7483954	Alright, on that note, I think we're going to go to a break.
7485074	7485615	Let's see.
7486455	7487136	Oh, yes, Loki.
7487696	7495742	And chopping up a song very crudely and in, I might add, Gold Wave, is also not a remix.
7498564	7499425	Okay, fair enough.
7500154	7501695	I think what we're going to do is we're going to go to a break.
7501715	7506140	And why don't we do, because we haven't played any of this in a while, why don't we do some music from FoonMix?
7506760	7507221	Sound good?
7507241	7508241	Yes.
7508522	7509362	Sounds foony.
7509603	7510624	Sounds foonerific.
7510644	7511965	Alright, we'll play some FoonMix music.
7512245	7514007	And then we come back, the FUs of the week.
7514988	7517750	Because what a good way to follow up some FoonMix music.
7518070	7521474	Alright, we'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.
7521594	7521774	Enjoy.
7531093	7532394	Oh, wait a minute.
7532414	7532815	What is this?
7532955	7534036	It's making me think about my life.
7534056	7535077	Feel the touch of love.
7570786	7574657	He's the roof operator Hypnotized by the look in your eyes Hit the coast
7611309	7611871	See you.
7867227	7867869	Thanks for watching!

7940513	7943954	A friendly public service announcement from Orange Lounge Radio.
7945259	7947359	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
7947960	7950460	We're going to try to do a list list in a little while.
7950580	7953841	And I think the topic tonight, so you guys can start thinking about it.
7954841	7956121	Well, should I hold off on it?
7957602	7957822	Yeah.
7958182	7959002	Alright, we'll hold off on it.
7960362	7965003	Some of you guys that were in chat earlier tonight already know what the list list is all about for tonight.
7965043	7967084	So, you know, start thinking about that.
7967104	7970125	Because I am going to do the one that you guys were talking about beforehand.
7970205	7971665	I said that would be a good list list topic.
7972742	7973182	We'll do that.
7973602	7976143	But first, we have to get ranty.
7976263	7981605	Yes, because it just would not be an episode of Orange Lounge Radio if we did not have a little bit... What in the hell is that noise?
7984126	7986007	You need to talk about what that's all about, Loki.
7986027	7986667	What is that thing?
7986807	7987687	It's my gavel meter.
7988027	7988748	What the hell is that?
7989208	7993809	It records, or it displays EM fields, like dangerous stuff.
7994670	7997991	For instance, Jamie's laptop, pretty safe.
8001041	8005142	Yeah, that's about like .6 milligauss, or 6 milligausses.
8005962	8008302	Or, yeah, I think it's .6, that's right, because this is 0 to 1.
8009282	8016804	But, for instance, like my TV, it's off the scale, so basically I'm getting cancerous rays as I sit there with the TV on.
8016964	8017344	Awesome.
8018844	8020344	Yeah, it's a cancer meter.
8020625	8021745	That's basically what it is.
8023245	8024125	And it's also for ghost hunting.
8024945	8026786	Yeah, I like how you just added that in here.
8026866	8028026	Oh, and it's also for ghost hunting.
8030276	8033278	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8057389	8058030	Oh, this is bad.
8058070	8058812	Here is justice.
8066868	8067729	My first F.U.
8067769	8072471	goes toward people who decide to weave in and out of lanes in the fog.
8073251	8075452	That's really stupid and that's how accidents happen.
8075992	8079373	But then again, I suppose the Darwinism will soon work on that moron.
8080634	8086976	Another one goes to people who drive too slow in the fog because then all the rest of us are backed up by the people who are speeding running into my ass.
8087796	8090558	And of course, driving off without stopping or anything, so...
8092018	8093540	Um, F.U.
8093560	8115360	goes to the top of my trunk inside because I gouged out a big piece of my thumb just shy of the tendon and it bled and bled and bled and I got one of those band-aids on it that's supposed to trap the fluids underneath so that you'll heal faster using your own antibodies and it looks like a big purple bubble.
8115801	8116642	It's really disgusting.
8118187	8120729	and F.U.
8120789	8130215	toward the financial situation where I can't afford to get the special edition 2DX8 style, but I have Parappa coming, so it's all good.
8132857	8133277	And F.U.
8133317	8136079	toward how expensive Dan's present was.
8137000	8141823	Since he doesn't listen to the show, I have no problem saying that I bought Dan the Ultimate Matrix box set
8143384	8147827	and it was $70 although I think they marked it down by $10 at Target.
8149407	8149687	I paid $59.
8149908	8154190	Yeah, I was about that at Target.
8154230	8154810	They lowered the price.
8155370	8160613	But still, when I first looked at it and saw a $70 price tag I was freaking out but I bought it for them anyway.
8164435	8170259	Another F you goes toward just the sick that I had for the past three days.
8171159	8174481	It was the type of illness that just saps all of your energy.
8175102	8183307	And I did nothing but eat lobster burritos and ice cream for three days, sat on the floor and played Phantasy Star Online and slept.
8183867	8187170	Those are the only three things I did for the past three days.
8187230	8189331	Today's the first day I felt like getting out and moving around.
8190292	8190912	And that's really it.
8192848	8195070	Alright, let's move on to Loki!
8199253	8204737	Um... The only thing I can remember is the stupid bitch that tried to pass me in the right lane today.
8205577	8209980	Cause, you know, it was merging over, and there's a lane that you're not supposed to pass in.
8210301	8213823	And so she tries to, you know, accelerate up to me, and she almost hits my car.
8214143	8217946	And so I honk at her, and she doesn't look at me because she knows she's stupid.
8219867	8220308	And, um...
8222620	8250243	and the slow driver I was behind on the way to my dad's house today because he's driving down a one lane road fucking slow because there's a little fog in the distance and he can only see, you know, 999 miles and not, you know, the full thousand, so damn and, um what else, oh, and I feel like I just noticed right now that wonderful device that talks to the dead is all fucked up because it was in
8251601	8260229	My backpack type thing and cut all the wires broken and god knows where the germanium is.
8260709	8262251	Now I gotta fix it so that sucks.
8264033	8277305	And then fuck you to my work for making me have to cook more shit because I want to have another potluck because now they want to start becoming like a team or something which I guess involves numerous potlucks.
8278345	8283229	I don't like potlucks, fucking bastards, just because they want to eat pigs.
8285230	8295839	Um, and then also, fuck you, that stupid orc that killed my, uh, Malala's manslave character.
8297020	8301343	And that sucked, because poor Taru was just like, looked like a cookie.
8301543	8301904	ADDICT!
8303084	8304606	Oh yeah, I think you were there too.
8306268	8318599	I don't know, I don't really have much to complain about.
8318879	8324845	Oh yeah, my boss for not giving me my review yet, and I know I'm not going to get a raise, even though I've been there for five years.
8325780	8327842	I'm not getting paid shit, so that sucks.
8328523	8330845	And then, uh, I don't know.
8331986	8333107	I just hate Christmas.
8333567	8337711	Fuck you to Christmas, because, you know, I don't want to buy people gifts.
8337931	8338492	You're a Grinch.
8338932	8345278	I buy people gifts all year round, and I don't really give a shit about the birthday of Jesus or whatever it's supposed to be for.
8345879	8349142	You know, I'm sure Immaculate Conception...
8352082	8353505	Okay, that's what I gotta say.
8354367	8355750	Mary was a fucking whore, okay?
8356392	8357635	She just does not want to admit it.
8357655	8359339	They're not putting it in the books, okay?
8360160	8360902	But you know that...
8362315	8363015	She had her way.
8363455	8365616	She had her way around Bethlehem there.
8366437	8367017	Little slut.
8367297	8371659	Anyway, um... Well, now that we're all going to hell, anything else you want to share?
8372499	8381483	Um, yeah, if I give my printer for being out of ink and I have to buy more ink because the fucking cartridges are, like, tiny, you print, like, one page and it's like, Out of ink!
8381923	8382903	You're out of ink!
8383484	8384064	Ah, shit.
8384804	8392390	I might as well buy a new printer, because it comes with the ink when you buy a new printer, and it's just about as expensive as replacing the ink, so why not?
8392410	8393971	Alright, I'm done.
8401147	8408730	An F you to the fog, because fog is scary, and I don't like driving in it, and I think people are always going to run into me, and it's scary.
8409270	8411891	An F you to the fact that the bar sucked last night.
8411971	8413711	I did not have really a lot of fun.
8413751	8417853	Well, you know, I had fun with the person that I went with, but I just wasn't feeling it.
8418649	8420610	So, F you to bars in general.
8420650	8421550	I think I'm going to stop going.
8421650	8423410	Except for karaoke, because I love karaoke.
8425831	8428832	And I don't really have a whole lot else.
8428892	8439354	An F you to not really getting any sleep in the past few days, and the fact that I'm not going to get any more in the next few, because I've got a lot of stuff going on at work next week, and I just want to cry.
8441335	8442055	That's it for me.
8442215	8444876	Let's go on to DDR Angel.
8448557	8451039	As I try not to strangle Rob with the mic cord.
8451499	8451800	Yay!
8454241	8455142	I don't even know.
8455402	8465990	Well, yeah, just F you to circumstances, because... Well, not for me personally, but for other people that I... Yeah, I know.
8466750	8469312	But I don't like said person either.
8469992	8470633	So never mind.
8473243	8482847	and yeah, nothing else because it's Christmas week and I'm not as angsty as I was last week, so too bad.
8486148	8489609	Alright, Arcadian42, what's on your mind?
8489629	8496691	Uh, let's see, uh, fuck you to Feel Uncounted Law at the moment.
8496711	8498692	I don't know, I just feel tired tonight.
8499792	8501753	Uh, fuck you to... You're getting it.
8502509	8502929	Am I getting?
8503389	8506910	Well, I don't know if I'm getting anything, but I just had colds and stuff.
8507691	8516253	Maybe I've just been... Okay, uh... I don't know.
8516273	8518254	It's not really too much.
8518394	8523516	I'll give a preliminary fuck you to the Sacramento Quark, because they're probably going to make me pay the full damn fine.
8524596	8526176	I hope they'll reduce it for me.
8526257	8528837	Out of the goodness of their hearts.
8529918	8530778	They have no hearts!
8532412	8533733	But, we'll see.
8536815	8537195	Alright.
8538416	8539216	Explicit!
8540757	8541217	Alright.
8542158	8546520	I've already said most of my Effie is from the SVGL tournament.
8547841	8549662	Okay, an Effie goes to the Fog.
8550322	8552924	God damn, I couldn't even see what the hell is driving.
8553804	8560028	Oh my god, thank god I didn't go to SVGL because I would have cried like a little girl in the Fog because I hate Fog.
8560248	8561069	I really, really hate Fog.
8561089	8561509	Fog is sexy.
8562475	8566100	F you to my friend Patrick for giving me the wrong directions.
8566140	8567982	We almost got lost a few times.
8568663	8572167	Heading to SVGL and heading back again to Sacramento.
8573608	8578034	Either that or just giving F you to Yahoo Maps for messing up the directions.
8579731	8583633	F you to my friend for misplanning the time management just heading to SVGL.
8584513	8592456	We were supposed to be there like around 11.15 as planned, but I had planned earlier, but he wanted me to do certain things.
8593377	8597678	Therefore causing us to be there around like 11.35, almost being late to the whole tournament.
8600159	8603861	And I hate to say this, but F you to my friend Sean for, not Shane, for...
8604798	8623073	Being to MSBGL very late, instead he went to Milpitas Golf Land, playing in the groove for 30 minutes, when you know there's a big tournament that a friend of ours, who was actually at his car, who hella wanted to compete in this first big tournament, and trying to shine at his first tournament.
8623533	8629478	Yeah, we have an actual... You know that's kind of smart, to go play in the groove at Milpitas, because you know everybody's a Sunnyvale?
8630439	8631900	No, hella is not a word.
8632981	8633281	Okay.
8635836	8636076	Yes.
8636437	8641521	I just needed to point out that somehow or another I managed to spend $111.11 at the grocery store today.
8643082	8645064	Thank you for that bit of utter randomness.
8645945	8646765	Back to explicit.
8647246	8653371	Okay, an FU goes to having four freaking finals the whole week, not getting me enough sleep.
8655493	8659536	Damn, finals sucks, but at least it's over with and at least I passed all my fucking classes.
8660437	8661178	Thank God for that.
8662757	8669720	and FU2 people who actually spent $23,000 on a fucking Yu-Gi-Oh card.
8670960	8671220	Yes.
8672681	8674642	That is ridiculously stupid.
8675722	8681865	Spending $23,000 on a freaking card, which is going to be released later on as an actual comment.
8682785	8685286	Everyone knows that, you know, Pokemon's where it's at.
8686659	8689660	A card collector with lots of liquid assets to throw away at any whim?
8712414	8714595	A person who burns money in his fireplace.
8714635	8716756	A person who wipes his ass with dollar bills.
8718256	8719877	A person who uses napkins.
8721578	8723538	Or actually, dollar bills as napkins.
8725819	8728260	A person who eats money.
8732122	8737364	Okay, and F you goes to the scar I have on my leg during the SVGL3 tournament.
8738544	8740905	I was non-stop bleeding the whole time.
8742242	8743923	Wow, really, and you didn't die?
8743943	8746424	I didn't die, so I'm still alive.
8746784	8749686	Not poisoned and stuff and all.
8750086	8753528	And FU goes to the rest of the drama on SVGL3, of course.
8753928	8757409	Yes, I screwed up on the fucking tournament, regardless of the TAT issues or not.
8759330	8763512	And FU goes to Amp, the drink Amp, for not keeping me awake the whole time.
8763572	8766434	It says it's supposed to keep me awake just like balls does.
8767113	8769114	Well, those assholes were lying to you.
8769975	8772076	I'm sorry there's no substitute for balls.
8772516	8774837	Some good balls down your throat is just perfect.
8774857	8777379	Yeah, because someone said, amp is better.
8777719	8778119	Wow.
8778619	8781881	I nearly fell asleep in the wheel and almost got into an accident.
8782081	8785103	God damn that stimulant for not keeping me away.
8787256	8790957	Yeah, that's how bad our freaking amp is.
8791037	8797880	Oh yeah, the Amp2DX is good for being hella- either the songs being hella off-sync or just me being off-sync as shit.
8798920	8805703	Scoring like 90% good is not cool, especially for songs that you nearly- That's cool for me.
8805823	8811805	That's like playing D2R with a full grade attack, which I nearly done.
8814295	8818137	And finally... And... Oh, no, I'm coming!
8818157	8819878	Wrap it up!
8820398	8822700	Oh, yeah, of course, FU for not sleeping, of course.
8823120	8826982	FU for actually cleaning up for fucking Christmas.
8827022	8831584	I know Christmas is at our house, and that's why I'm taking it this week, but I shouldn't have been cleaning up the whole week.
8831825	8833525	I had finals, for goddamn sakes.
8835346	8838428	I swear to God, you're going to have your own spin-off show where you just sit there.
8838948	8839949	You and Dark Child.
8840029	8841530	I'm going to give you guys your own show.
8842090	8843531	It's going to be on at 3 in the morning.
8844926	8846787	so you can get this all out of your system.
8849188	8850069	Now wrap it up.
8850729	8852230	Fine.
8852610	8853991	That has to be continued.
8854672	8856653	No, no, never to be continued.
8857153	8857933	Over.
8857973	8858154	Done.
8858454	8860235	Are you in the booth or something?
8860295	8862196	What is this sound effect?
8862516	8864877	Why hasn't he tried out for like the real world?
8865278	8867979	I hate my roommates because they annoy me so.
8868059	8869300	Let me count the ways.
8872196	8873377	Damn those cameras!
8874058	8876219	Let's fucking break the cameras and blow up the house.
8879002	8880884	Yeah, like I said, to be continued.
8881464	8883466	There's no ending of the FU, bruh.
8885339	8886460	Thank you, Sheriff.
8909861	8910801	Who needs friends?
8911242	8914824	DJ Ranma S says, You know what you sound like right now?
8914844	8916464	You sound like our old microphone.
8918165	8921707	This is Matt, coming to you from two years ago.
8921727	8923308	Oh yeah.
8924609	8928931	DJ Ranma S says, F you to the idiots on my job for stealing broken iPods.
8929231	8930351	Are you that fucking stupid?
8930692	8934974	Another F you to the RIAA MPAA for taking down supernova.org.
8935054	8936314	Rot in hell, you bastards.
8936354	8936995	No, it's funny.
8937075	8937215	Wait!
8937850	8943893	If you actually go to supernova.org and check out the site, it says that they shut down due to bandwidth issues, not because of the RIA or MPAA.
8943973	8948036	However, bi-torrent.com.
8948236	8953179	That's not B-U-I, but B-I, like bisexual, bi-torrent.com.
8953559	8954259	And thank me later.
8955500	8962664	And all I have to say is... There's something else probably going to come out that's going to replace BitTorrent anyways.
8964215	8965375	I'm coming out of the booth!
8966076	8968236	I'm just using Torrent Reactor right now.
8968376	8969157	Alright, back to the FUs.
8971318	8980341	And an FU, continuing DJ Ranma S, and an FU to the customer that tried to kick my ass for buying the very last mini PS2 in my store.
8980901	8982061	Suck on a cold!
8982361	8984222	Stop buying smaller products!
8984402	8989404	Goddammit, Sony's trying to do to you what they did, or what Nintendo did with the Game Boy.
8989484	8992505	Just release the same shit, smaller and less, uh...
8999265	9006871	I'm gonna shove that tube up your ass that you're using for the sound effects.
9009833	9011395	Sherlock has an FU.
9012255	9016959	An FU to the Syracuse DDR scene for being a bunch of hypocritical shit-talkers.
9017479	9019661	You're the reason why I hate going to the local arcades.
9022038	9024100	And Jazz says, F you to Fog.
9024420	9026902	I had to drive via road reflectors last night.
9029404	9033967	DarkSakura sends a message and it says, I want to offer a fuck you to that Sky guy.
9034047	9035228	He really pisses me off.
9035348	9035888	Seriously.
9037669	9038310	Screw you, hippie.
9042520	9048665	Jaded2004 says, F you to my windows for making it cold in here because it's 12 degrees outside.
9049065	9050846	Oh my god, it's time to move to the Bahamas.
9051066	9052507	Seriously.
9052587	9053488	I don't see it.
9053969	9054249	Sorry.
9057991	9059072	Can I see that tube for a minute?
9059673	9059773	No.
9059793	9060653	No, I want to do the sound effect.
9060694	9062295	No, I want to do the sound effect.
9062315	9063335	Come on, let me do the sound effect.
9065397	9067198	This is God talking.
9067679	9069760	Loki, you need to be punished.
9074844	9076405	He has rock jerbs on it now.
9077986	9078646	I Frenched it.
9080167	9087431	Rychan says, F you to the manic depressants that seem to find me and being the person I am, listening to their whining and act like their friend.
9088031	9090773	F you to my awesome week coming to an end on my birthday.
9091353	9093074	F you to myself for crying so much.
9093995	9095836	Rychan needs an Orange Lounge hug.
9096636	9097417	Hug!
9099165	9102067	and F you to my ignition pads finally biting the dust.
9102187	9102907	I loved you guys.
9103107	9104228	Nine months of accomplishments.
9104588	9104989	Cry face.
9106489	9113574	Illusion says F you to this crazy lady that was honking at us and flipping us off as we headed home from Knott's Berry Farm last night.
9113674	9114214	Okay, hold on.
9115415	9116455	I have two issues with that.
9118296	9121418	A, when you're in SoCal, that's the way everybody drives down there.
9121758	9122539	You're all fucking nuts.
9122919	9125601	And B, what the hell were you doing at Knott's Berry Farm?
9126673	9127794	Dude, that place rocks.
9127814	9129176	You can make your own candles.
9129316	9130337	Knott's Berry Farm.
9131898	9135802	I don't know about now, but five years ago, man, the laughing stock of theme parks.
9135822	9139246	I don't know about you, but how can they have a theme park based around jelly?
9139787	9140307	I mean, really.
9141008	9141849	Jelly Land.
9143330	9145532	With Snoopy and his jelly bandits.
9148175	9149737	It's like an overrated, like...
9151021	9151862	I don't even know what.
9152002	9153203	Alright, illusion continues.
9153363	9159209	F you to myself for being too greedy to want to pay my own hard-earned money on other people.
9160851	9162012	And, yeah, emphasis on hard.
9162393	9164014	And F you to televangelism.
9167398	9167999	And lastly...
9169110	9173431	Podo says, F you to imbalanced paladins in the World of Warcraft.
9173871	9176132	I'm tired of killing the thing three times.
9176212	9177332	Well, don't play World of Warcraft.
9177833	9182314	And another F you to Loki for that Virgin Mary comment.
9182614	9183194	Just kidding.
9183974	9192557	But do F you to not say, and I quote, JK, but do F you to not saying Merry Christmas, everyone.
9194658	9195278	Christmas?
9197352	9197712	Get it?
9197772	9198493	No, no, no.
9198633	9199253	No more.
9199293	9199593	Get it?
9199733	9200594	Chris Mass?
9200874	9201234	I don't know.
9201954	9203075	Christ Mass.
9203315	9206417	Oh, Illusion says Knott's Berry Farm is only ten bucks now.
9206677	9207077	I get it.
9207157	9208198	I get what you pay for.
9210719	9212540	Do they pay you ten dollars to go there?
9213440	9215001	So if an enema is ten dollars.
9220004	9222485	Alright, you guys want to do some listless tonight?
9223416	9225316	Okay, we need some folks to participate in Listless tonight.
9225576	9226037	Sure enough.
9226217	9227057	All right.
9227137	9228217	Jamie, you're going to do it, right?
9228697	9229137	Sure enough.
9229177	9229937	Loki, you're going to do it?
9231278	9231638	Yes.
9231898	9232838	And I'm going to do it.
9233018	9233758	Angel, are you going to do it?
9234638	9235779	And why don't you two share?
9237379	9238499	The couch gets to share.
9239920	9240840	You know what?
9240860	9240920	No.
9241100	9241980	I changed my mind.
9242340	9244021	Arcadian gets to do it by himself.
9244061	9245421	Jonas, you don't get to do it because you were late.
9246678	9250160	But if you want to do it late, or if you want to do it... Jonas is late.
9250341	9251001	Is he pregnant?
9251181	9253283	If you want to help Arcadian, you can.
9253723	9253983	Alright.
9254704	9264350	The way Listless works... Okay, we haven't done Listless in a long time, but the way Listless works, because you know how we have this obsession in our society where we have to create the top list.
9264370	9268113	Like, we have to have the top three of all... Actually, can I have the tube?
9268473	9269333	Can I have the tube for a minute?
9270174	9274097	It's the top three of all time.
9274617	9275037	Beatmania2DX
9301660	9305161	Rumor is that someday, somehow, they're going to bring it over to the USA.
9305722	9311284	But they can't really call it Beatmania 2DX, because there was no Beatmania DX.
9312084	9315805	Now, you can't really call it Hip Hop Mania either, because that's gay.
9316265	9320627	So, we have to come up with a new name for Beatmania 2DX.
9320707	9328750	So tonight, we're going to come up with the top three names for Beatmania 2DX in America of all time.
9330026	9332868	Your head does not have the water for properties of the tube!
9333188	9342595	Okay, remember guys, top three names for Beatmania 2DX's American release of all time.
9342755	9350140	Now, of course, to humor those people that are going to get out there and go, you know, Orange Lounge Radio, you fags.
9351092	9354654	What they should do is just call it Beat Mania 2DX.
9355554	9356155	Who cares?
9356535	9356795	Okay.
9356835	9358596	Speaking of that... I understand that.
9359236	9364019	Speaking of that... My stipulation though is that nobody can pick Beat Mania 2DX as the title.
9364139	9365299	Yeah, that's a given.
9365339	9367740	And nobody can say Hip Hop Mania 2 either.
9367780	9368641	Be more creative.
9368881	9369421	Hey, hold on.
9369441	9369541	What?
9369561	9372563	I actually hear people call Beat Mania 2DX Beat Mania 2Dicks.
9372903	9373423	So, okay.
9373984	9374684	Beat Me With Two Dicks?
9374704	9375404	Is that what you just said?
9375444	9376265	Beat Mania 2Dicks.
9376305	9377125	Beat You With Two Dicks?
9377165	9377945	I can have that arranged.
9378026	9378346	Alright.
9379046	9379806	Not by me, of course.
9380227	9380527	Alright.
9388562	9391643	Alright, so just humor us a little bit, you guys.
9391783	9393424	We're coming up with new names, okay?
9393984	9394304	Alright.
9395665	9400886	In the meantime, we're going to go to a break featuring some tracks from Beatmania 2DX.
9401226	9401747	Go figure.
9402367	9404528	I mean, who knew that I would want to choose this kind of song?
9405188	9406208	You want to hear the Safari?
9406228	9407969	You want to hear a Safari?
9408029	9410490	Alright, we'll do the Safari, because the Safari's been in like every 2DX.
9410710	9411350	Alright, we'll be back.
9509705	9510866	Thanks for watching!
9543757	9545698	Thanks for watching!
9624022	9625146	Thanks for watching!
9824071	9825852	Gaming Radio, so uncensored.
9846915	9851441	and even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.
9851601	9852963	Orange Lounge Radio.
9855346	9859070	Hello everybody and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
9860520	9862522	We're about to get this listless segment underway.
9862602	9872309	Remember that we are trying to find the top three names that they could call Beatmania 2DX if they released it in the US.
9872389	9875832	Because you can't call it 2DX because there was no one.
9876372	9878894	Of course, then you could argue that Hip Hop Mania would be the name.
9879274	9881456	But that's gay, so we're not going to call it that either.
9881636	9884418	So we're going to find a new name for it here.
9886700	9890163	Or for anybody that plays Final Fantasy XI with me, it's SoTeets.
9892564	9892964	All right.
9897126	9897406	Yes.
9898946	9902028	Well, yes, DarkSakura, you need, it's right, well, you threw it on the floor.
9902068	9902488	Somebody did.
9907350	9907810	Um, Rob?
9908931	9909131	Yes.
9909571	9909851	Addict!
9912592	9914733	Then again, I'm over here chatting with two people about PSO.
9914793	9917454	I know, you're like, oh, I'm going to go home and I'm going to play PSO all night.
9917494	9918935	No, I'm going to go eat my shake.
9921593	9923174	All right, let's see.
9923234	9927155	I was going to try to find some game show music here, but I don't know if I have anything.
9928235	9928415	Dammit!
9928435	9929416	We need Price is Right music.
9930496	9931856	I kind of have Price is Right music.
9931876	9933157	Actually, I do have an idea what we could do.
9933217	9934557	We need Plinko music.
9934717	9936838	I don't have... There is no Plinko music.
9936858	9938558	I don't know.
9938598	9940399	We need the yodeling one.
9942860	9944620	You know which one that is where he goes up the mountain?
9944800	9945741	No, I got a better idea.
9945761	9946381	We're going to do this one.
9948244	9955786	It's not that it's a... Okay, seriously, stop.
9959646	9961026	That's right, everybody.
9962147	9965227	It's time to play Listless.
9966807	9974649	Tonight's celebrities for Listless will be determining our list of the top three names for Beatmania 2DX in America of all time.
9975796	9977437	Say hello to DarkSakura!
9977977	9979138	Oh shit, my clothes are done.
9979198	9980299	Say hello to Loki!
9982220	9984521	Say hello to DDR Angel!
9985742	9986542	Um, hi.
9986622	9988403	Say hello to Arcadia42!
9988503	9990685	I'm like, wow, man.
9990765	9994207	And say hello to Barker'sBeautyExplicit!
9994327	9995107	Motherfucker!
9995388	9996008	Alright.
9999590	10000851	And now, introducing...
10002705	10003205	Sky!
10003505	10003725	Hi.
10004065	10004425	Here I am.
10005446	10007266	Not that I use two voices or anything.
10007306	10007526	All right.
10008006	10011067	Let's go around and see what everybody came up with, and I'm going to write them down here.
10011427	10013448	Remember, chat room, you guys have the final say.
10013988	10023250	And in great reality radio fare, there's an elimination round where we're going to take out some of the ones that we deem to be crappy.
10024631	10024911	All right.
10024951	10025471	Let's hear it.
10026031	10027191	Jamie, number three.
10028672	10029912	I can't believe it's not BB and GDX.
10032322	10034744	I can't believe it's not B-Mania 2DX!
10040048	10040569	Why that name?
10041530	10042010	Any reason why?
10043291	10044012	Because it's not.
10045433	10045773	Loki!
10046293	10046754	You're number three.
10047995	10048956	Super Toast!
10051157	10052418	Super Toast!
10052899	10054880	Any reason why you're calling it Super Toast?
10055261	10056802	Because it's better than normal toast.
10062433	10064414	All right, DDR Angel, you're number three.
10065675	10066435	She needs more time.
10066515	10067656	You got a number three at least?
10067836	10068336	You got one?
10069656	10071657	Okay, Jamie can scream at it now.
10073698	10073978	What?
10074319	10074739	You could.
10075219	10075719	It's funny.
10076459	10079721	Okay, I don't know if Rob's going to laugh when you say it already.
10079741	10080541	Just say it already.
10080981	10082102	Spinning Tatoo Master.
10083223	10084063	Spinning what?
10084583	10085323	No, that's not right.
10085444	10086264	Spinning Tatoo Mania.
10087705	10089406	Spinning Tarou Mania!
10090326	10093308	Why would I laugh at a Final Fantasy XI joke?
10099051	10099411	Alright.
10100871	10110556	My number three pick, because I was thinking that they want to actually sell copies of this game, so they'd have to borrow from another franchise.
10110576	10113538	So my number three pick for a name would be Rumble Roses 2.
10117080	10118801	Rumble Roses 2!
10122884	10128407	Alright, uh, Arcadian42 and Xplizit, what number 3 name did you come up with?
10128427	10129488	We're gonna do it separately.
10131149	10132430	You can do it separately, that's fine.
10132450	10134011	Alright, you're number 3, Arcadian.
10134391	10137112	Okay, uh, play it to these stupid Americans.
10137213	10139634	It's gonna be, it's like keys and stuff!
10141115	10143416	It's like keys and stuff!
10149099	10151360	Alright, explicit, your number three pick.
10152541	10156323	My number three pick would be Beatbox Revolution.
10159424	10161245	Beatbox Revolution!
10161606	10162186	Any reason why?
10164747	10166548	Okay, that's gross sounding.
10166828	10168309	I explained it.
10169930	10171911	Alright, let's go on to our number two picks.
10172551	10173472	Starting off with Jamie.
10176038	10177019	Button Smashing Game.
10177579	10179181	Button Smashing Game!
10183645	10184966	Loki, your number two pick.
10189870	10195555	I would go with... He puts a lot of work into this, you guys.
10200089	10204353	It's gonna be, um, how about just Turntable Mania?
10204834	10206315	Turntable Mania!
10208297	10208978	God, that sucks.
10209458	10210099	I gotta think of a better one.
10210279	10212001	Alright, Angel, your number two pick.
10213762	10214663	This one sucks, too.
10214984	10215164	Ah!
10215384	10216485	DJ Spin Master.
10217386	10219188	DJ Spin Master!
10225373	10233396	My number two pick, again, going with the theme of they actually want to sell copies of this game in the US, would be MTV Presents Britney Mania 2005.
10235497	10236697	Brit Mania, for short.
10244340	10245260	Alright, moving on.
10245320	10247421	Let's go to Arcadian 42.
10247481	10249642	Something a bit more normal.
10249822	10250922	Feel the Beat Mania.
10251642	10253543	Feel the Beat Mania!
10259921	10261022	Pretend you're a real DJ, but not...
10290031	10292852	Pretend you're a real DJ, but not!
10294952	10296452	Is it but not or but you're not?
10298413	10299313	I had that, but not really.
10303054	10305895	Pretend you're a real DJ, but not really!
10307135	10307955	Loki, you're number one.
10309895	10311896	I had to think long and hard on this, okay.
10314336	10316197	It's Super Monkey Wombat Cheese Burrito.
10318459	10332587	Super Monkey Wombat Cheese Burrito Any particular reason why you want to call a video game with falling bars Super Monkey Wombat Cheese Burrito?
10336029	10337250	Because it fits.
10337490	10338170	You're an idiot.
10338270	10339351	Alright, Angel.
10339611	10344114	Well, if he's an idiot, my next one's not that much better, but I thought it was funny.
10344894	10347696	From a total noob's perspective Oh shit, there's too much to do!
10347836	10348136	The game.
10350362	10350983	Oh shit!
10351043	10352324	There's too much to do!
10352845	10353485	The game!
10361794	10362675	My number one pick...
10363953	10369177	My number one pick, I think, really encompasses what the game is really all about.
10369677	10378684	Because I've been playing Bomani for a long, long time, and I've been looking at the forums and everything, and I think I've captured the name that really shows what this game is all about.
10378724	10382647	So my number one pick, Elitist Elitist Revolution.
10384969	10387231	Elitist Elitist Revolution!
10394065	10395986	Arcadian 42, your number one pick.

10494053	10495534	Loki, which one of these is coming off the list?

10567180	10567560	What is it?

10964215	10967036	Okay, so I guess that's going to wrap it up for the show, you guys.
10967856	10969777	I think that sums it up for me there.
10969817	10971238	Elitist, elitist revolution.

10993579	10996460	And a new end of the year special.
10996600	10998621	And that means, of course, we've got to do this again.
10998661	11001002	We've got to do a list list for the best Bomani song of the year.
11001582	11002523	So that's going to be a big one.
11002583	11003743	So more information to come on that.

11013528	11014388	So, Jamie, your final thought.
11015484	11019385	I wish I were home so I could change into my freshly washed pajama bottoms.
11020225	11022285	They're comfy and soft and smell like gain.
11023505	11024866	Drive around in your pajama bottoms.
11024886	11025386	That's what I do.
11025406	11030767	Alright, she's holding it to her face like a gas mask.
11031087	11032227	I exquisite your final thought.
11034527	11035127	Can't hear you, buddy.
11036708	11037728	No, I seriously can't hear you, buddy.
11040348	11040848	I can't hear him.
11040868	11041449	Get him the other mic.
11041489	11041909	Quick, quick.
11042369	11043469	No, he has to walk over here.
11043789	11044089	Alright.

11068330	11070092	Cross your fingers, we'll have to play the whole damn fine.
11072842	11080627	I gotta buy me one of those bootleg Nintendo things in the mall because they're still selling them even though they got in trouble for that shit.
11081008	11086631	Then I gotta look at my cabinet because my cabinet's lonely and needs more interfaces.
11088232	11092115	And my final thought for tonight, everybody, is bootay.
11094494	11098877	My final thought is Super Monkey Wombat Cheese Burrito.
11099018	11100419	Which didn't get a single vote, by the way.
11100439	11101399	You know what?
11102220	11102841	I don't care.
11103141	11104882	It will have a special place in my heart.
11107684	11110667	Yeah, that'll be the time you're getting your 12th bypass.
11112028	11113569	They have to have that surgically removed.

11431184	11441807	Orange Lounge Radio, the post-show, or the afterbirth, as we so lovingly called it for these past two and a half years, where we talk about all that other stuff that we didn't get to quite on the show.
11441927	11443627	I can't believe we've been doing it this long.
11443687	11445007	Oh my god, it's seriously time to quit.
11445047	11446388	Ah, fuck me.
11446448	11447028	No, I'm kidding.
11447628	11448648	Quitter, quitter.
11448668	11449569	We'll be doing this right.
11449649	11450849	You know, I got a fortune cookie today.
11450869	11451469	It was really weird.
11451529	11455510	It said something about, like, something you are focusing on, and I was thinking about Orange Lounge Radio when I read it.
11455530	11459331	It said something you are focusing on, it will grow a lot in this next year.
11459926	11461128	It'll be very interesting to see what happens.
11463030	11464552	Although we have a really boring webcam.
11464572	11466594	We seriously need to start pointing that somewhere else.
11466674	11468437	Like, we need to get a goldfish or something.
11469778	11472502	You know, when you were reading that fortune, I was thinking of my penis, so...
11477118	11478360	I had so much food today.
11478380	11480443	I went to Panda Express and I ate like a three combo.
11481103	11482305	Did you break the webcam?
11482325	11482926	Way to go.
11484248	11485029	I'm so awesome.
11487952	11489194	That wasn't Jamie, that was me.
11489795	11490375	If you can believe it.
11491121	11491861	You're belchy.
11492161	11492401	I know.
11492901	11493642	I am going home, bye.
11494022	11494742	You're going home?
11495602	11495842	Fine.
11496302	11497943	I have to go home to my life.
11498363	11499903	Hey, you're going to E3s next year, right?
11500784	11501164	Well, yeah.
11501264	11503884	If we end up deciding to go to The Price is Right, will you go?
11504045	11508406	Because hearing Come On Down made me think of, you know, when I went to The Price is Right a couple years ago.
11508426	11509526	It was so much fun.
11509786	11510186	Sure.
11510986	11511847	And Loki, you're going to go too?
11512287	11513507	I have to go before he dies.
11513647	11515027	Oh my god, what if I'm a contestant?
11515088	11519529	We all have to wear... Oh my god, if you were a contestant on that show, I'd pee myself because you'd be so shy.
11519549	11520029	I'd pee if I died.
11521149	11522750	I'd be like, yeah.
11522970	11523950	Oh my god!
