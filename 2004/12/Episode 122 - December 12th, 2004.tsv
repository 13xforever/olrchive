368984	369384	Sorry, guys.
369484	370344	We just probably got louder there.
371224	371805	I thought we were creamy.

438512	440713	I brought another minigame because I'm an addict.
441178	443299	Another mini-game, oh, the McDonald's mini-games.
443639	445459	Did we ever end up talking about that last week?
445539	446019	Yeah, we did.
446159	446640	A little bit?
446780	447240	Yeah, we did.

451021	451801	I don't know why I got it.
451821	453021	I was like, hey, they still have them.
453141	454742	Okay, what the hell?

467284	471787	But as for those of you guys abroad and the rest of the nation and the world, things are boring for you.
471807	472248	What can I say?

511304	512085	Works for me.
512285	513065	Alright, works for me.

827796	829017	Thank you guys for tuning in tonight.
829037	831498	We do appreciate your support, as always.
832298	834299	Some Eurobeat music in that break, just for you guys.
834499	836279	Because you guys seem to dig that during the pre-show.
836319	840861	At least those of you guys that spoke up in our chatroom, www.orangeloungeradio.com.
841261	847803	And if you didn't like that, well, you need to go back into chat and let us know so that the rest of the chatroom can yell at you appropriately.
847823	849624	Because that's what they'll do.
850384	852325	I'd like to be the first to say I didn't like that.
853959	856560	If you thought that break was bad, wait till you see the next break.
856580	858220	I already have the music queued up for the next break.
858640	861681	Tonight, the goal is to drive you all crazy.
862142	866543	Because, you know, it is the holiday time, and this is the time of year when everybody goes, we'll be crazy.
867323	870384	So, you know, just thought we'd get some appropriate music to match that.
870444	871004	So, we'll see.
871665	873305	And at some point tonight, Silent Hill.
873505	874025	I promise.
874325	877847	Because it is the season.
877967	878487	You know what we'll do?
878527	879787	We'll do like a Silent Hill break.
879807	882308	I'll play both remixes of Silent Hill, and then like your reign.
884758	891804	You gotta play both versions of Silent Hill than that one song by Roman Holloway that was in Dancing the Stage.
892405	893246	That's a Christmas song too.
893766	894427	If I can find it.
894507	896929	We need to hear You're Not Here.
897750	900252	Because I put that song on repeat four times in my car on the way here.
900492	902514	We'll definitely do You're Not Here a little later.
903034	905677	Remember when Parapara, or Parapara, however you like to say it.
905717	906157	Parapara.
906177	906758	Parapara.
906838	907498	Parapara.
907919	909060	Remember when that used to be cool?
910887	914091	It seems like this subject comes up at least once a month on this show.
914732	916976	When Parabara was cool.
917476	921943	I remember when we all met at Miggle when they first got it and I only knew how to do half of the patapata.
921963	924627	So I tried.
925552	928834	I remember tutorial mode in second mix, and I taught myself how to do it.
928854	931475	And I tried to learn the Mickey Mouse March, which we heard in that break there.
931495	932936	The Mickey Mouse March is freaking hard.
932956	934317	Freaking hard, oh my god.
934377	936318	And the DeltaDance.com is hard.
936938	938459	I think I'm, no, I never learned that one.
938479	940460	No, you were watching when I tried to learn that one.
940520	940780	Yeah.
940920	941801	In Stockton.
942081	950185	I, now, Loki sits here and bashes on Parapara, but I remember when he used to break out his white boy freestyle to some Parapara songs.
951857	954618	Yeah, that was back in the day when I was doing knee drops on DDR.
954658	956838	I've come a long way since then.
956998	959479	I remember how happy I was when I learned how to do Deluxe.
960899	962279	I'd get to go out there and shake my ass.
962659	966500	I love doing Deluxe, but I... No, you were funny doing Like a Virgin.
967440	970521	Like a Virgin was like the second par par I ever learned.
970581	973962	I remember living at the Bomani house.
974062	975762	Everyone learned Boom Boom Fire first.
976022	977762	You remember the Bomani house years ago, right?
978062	979723	I should say Bomani Drama House.
980143	980423	Bomani.
982000	983361	To say the least.
984441	986262	You know, different times.
986342	987063	What can you say?
987103	993526	But I remember when the house got para para, and that was like the first one I made myself sit down and learn.
993566	997468	I had already learned Boom Boom Fire, but I was like, it's got a Madonna connection.
998108	999649	As a gay man, I have to learn this dance.
1000669	1001650	And it wasn't really.
1002110	1003691	It's actually kind of challenging.
1003751	1005572	I still barely remember it to this day.
1005932	1006172	Well, I...
1008743	1013865	I know that my first one that I learned was actually Eurobeat, which is like really easy.
1014586	1020489	And then I learned, I tried to learn Speedway, but Boom and Fire was like my third one.
1021289	1028492	And then when we had the five song chorus, I learned how to do, Night of Fire was my second one, that was it.
1028552	1029793	Remember Sexy, Sexy, Sexy?
1030493	1030734	I know.
1030754	1031154	That was awesome.
1031634	1037997	But I wanted to learn, when we were still playing, I wanted to learn O Sole Mio, and I never did, just because the little walk where you stay on your ass.
1040029	1041050	You know what I'm talking about!
1041390	1043891	Oh sole mio, I just farted!
1045352	1052277	Well, you do your hand to one side, and then you do your other hand back, like the I'm the Little Teacup dance, except you're fanning your ass as you move forward.
1053638	1057480	It's like, my ass is on fire, put me out!
1059761	1062583	Most people who play Parapar probably have an ass on fire.
1064424	1065345	That was a good one.
1065365	1066786	You're welcome, any time.
1067412	1070095	It's little observations like that that make this show worth it, you know?
1070275	1071836	Yeah, you're so not PC.
1071876	1075960	I remember, that was really the first time we ever hung out, I think, that I met you, was that trip.
1076000	1092356	Yes, and then we went on to Ziggle, and Enrique was with us, and we both got our crappy Freestyle on 4th mix, and somehow or another, we ended up doing a complete mirror of each other.
1093746	1098208	and decided we were going to be all rad and did knee drops on the last thing, but it was like the two knee one.
1098828	1103230	It was to, uh, shoot, what was the song that everybody hated from Third Mix?
1103691	1105491	Was that the guy that always did the Buell dance?
1105651	1106892	Yeah, I always did Buell.
1107032	1107372	Okay.
1107932	1110354	The, the, uh, boy band song?
1110374	1110494	Yeah.
1110514	1115716	We always do the boy band style dancing, but we ended it, like, back to back at the same time.
1115756	1116276	It was pretty cool.
1116436	1117417	And I was like, oh my god.
1118217	1119278	Whatever happened to that guy?
1119858	1120758	I went into him.
1121319	1121619	Really?
1121999	1123960	Like six months ago or something.
1124380	1125721	But he's like, hi, hi, okay, bye.
1125801	1129363	I love talking about people that our national listenership has no idea who they are.
1129423	1132445	But you know, who did that thing?
1132885	1133505	He was cool.
1134486	1137567	You remember that guy at that one place here locally that did that thing?
1137627	1138268	He was awesome.
1139068	1141389	Anyway, we're getting a little off track.
1141429	1144371	We have to start off the show as we start off every night's programs.
1144983	1149445	with a little bit of How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day, where we find out how your week was and how your day was.
1149845	1151947	And maybe you played some Bomani this week, maybe you didn't.
1152007	1152707	We'll find out.
1152927	1154028	Jamie, start us off.
1155268	1156249	No big whoop.
1156309	1156849	No big whoop.
1157489	1161131	I would like to proceed this How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day to give Jamie her gift.
1161651	1161771	Oh.
1162592	1162772	Oh.
1163392	1163832	Presents.
1163852	1164613	I have a gift.
1164953	1165333	Presents.
1165433	1166714	I know I've got a gift.
1168737	1170379	I'm poor, so I haven't bought gifts yet, so forgive me.
1170419	1172041	It's a cute little gothy doll!
1187448	1188569	It's evil and cute.
1188609	1189390	Oh my god, I love it.
1189410	1192332	And she's got like religious symbols on her that want to kill people.
1192352	1193333	Can we put her on the cam?
1193433	1195114	I can use it to open a portal to hell.
1195334	1195895	Oh, hello.
1195935	1197256	You're off the Richter scale.
1197296	1199197	For once, Jamie is too loud tonight.
1199218	1200238	And she has an apple.
1201079	1202900	Jamie's doing the Jonas thing there a little bit.
1202920	1203721	Put her on the cam.
1203741	1203901	Alright.
1203921	1204782	She's cute.
1204982	1206123	I don't want to be on the cam though.
1206803	1209005	Alright, we'll get the doll on the cam, the evil doll.
1209506	1211307	And can you get my present up there too?
1212188	1213649	For those folks looking at the cam.
1214329	1215310	I'm not going to tell you what it is.
1215330	1216251	You have to go look at the cam.
1217468	1218109	It's right, it's right.
1218730	1220552	Angel, what's that DVD on the table there?
1220712	1221613	Oop, I already gave it him.
1222113	1222594	Alright, there you go.
1222614	1225897	You can go put that on the cam as well.
1226618	1230202	I have cute Dolly, and she's evil.
1230943	1231503	Alright, anyway.
1232524	1233946	So, DarkSakura, moving on.
1233966	1234767	How was your week, how was your day?
1236004	1240706	My week was cool, except I've been poor all week because I get paid like Wednesday.
1241926	1247367	So I have to wait until after payday to buy presents for people.
1247587	1248788	I'm just a procrastinator.
1248828	1250568	I'm not going to be buying any presents until Christmas Eve.
1251068	1254249	My whole week was nothing but school and working my ass off at the gym.
1254329	1255650	Oh, I love my doll so much.
1256710	1258190	Wow, these are so cool.
1258571	1260231	And they have apples with needles in them.
1262112	1263452	The perfect Halloween treat.
1265461	1266161	Oh my god!
1266862	1267742	I love this outfit.
1267802	1268563	I would wear this.
1269223	1269783	Seriously.
1270024	1271044	This is great radio.
1271865	1272145	Anyway.
1272725	1275487	Um... But, um... I, uh...
1276829	1290672	I really, all I did was go to the gym, and yesterday though, yesterday I hung out with, well I hung out with Anita twice at the gym, DD Alcoholic, and then I did a lot of spin, a lot of working out, I was really sore for a while.
1291053	1296014	Yesterday I hung out with Iguana Girl, and Islander, and Tia.
1297814	1299575	Who doesn't have an online name, she's just Tia.
1299595	1300295	She's just Tia.
1300875	1301696	Be great and terrible.
1302276	1302896	But awesome.
1303656	1304016	Totally.
1304917	1308658	And we played Mario Party 6, which is pretty groovy.
1309238	1309618	I won.
1309938	1310899	I won so cool.
1311059	1312399	I always win Mario Party.
1312419	1313880	I think I've been beaten one time.
1314580	1319062	The reign of Princess Peach Terror comes into play.
1319082	1319662	I was Boo.
1320662	1321963	And you know what we got?
1322563	1325604	Me and Tia won a game, one of the little mini games, and we got Daisy Boo.
1327285	1329407	Now, Princess Peach is still a playable character, right?
1329528	1332011	Thank God, because I always play Princess Peach.
1332091	1333533	I throw a fit if I can't be Peach.
1334294	1335595	You want to be the pretty princess.
1338179	1342144	Because I love when she does that Peach is the winner thing.
1342344	1343065	She flips her hair.
1344761	1348463	We need to move the chat room over the webcam again.
1348483	1356588	But anyway, we were trying to decide what to eat, so we kept talking about fish tacos.
1359009	1364192	And we couldn't get off of the subject about eating fish tacos.
1365353	1370456	How exactly do a bunch of women and Islander hanging out together prepare fish tacos?
1372364	1373225	It just came up.
1376168	1379812	A bunch of women hanging out preparing fish tacos.
1380913	1381233	Anyway.
1383515	1387479	It made me think about that time we went to the Elephant Bar and I ordered fish tacos and you laughed about it.
1388340	1388620	I did.
1388680	1389982	I giggled for like a half hour straight.
1390262	1391143	I am so immature.
1391423	1391924	But you know what?
1392084	1395047	I know our listeners are immature too because I'm looking at the chat room right now.
1396521	1398942	Everybody is making ass jokes.
1399682	1402424	Just they're saying DDR songs and they're putting ass in the title.
1402444	1403485	They'll tell the ass?
1403605	1414572	Yeah, Love is Ass, Paranoia Survivor Ass, I like this, Cartoon Asses, Tittle Assle, Blow My Ass Bitch.
1415212	1416253	That's a good one.
1416273	1417273	This is funny apparently.
1417293	1418154	How about Burning Ass?
1420375	1420675	Anyway.
1421596	1422016	Anyway.
1422096	1422897	Scorching Ass.
1424344	1427106	I was referring to Burning Heat, but Burning Heat can also refer to ass, too.
1427126	1427446	What do you mean?
1427466	1427986	Scorching Moon?
1428246	1429747	If one doesn't bathe or something.
1430228	1430488	Anyway.
1431028	1431989	Flash in the ass.
1434090	1435271	My week, my day.
1435291	1435471	Hello.
1435491	1436211	Sorry, sorry.
1436351	1437392	I have things to do.
1437412	1438512	Sorry, I was just preoccupied.
1438552	1439353	Drifting asses.
1439573	1439773	Ass.
1440313	1440614	Rob.
1440974	1441174	What?
1442074	1443395	Do you like to ass?
1443575	1445597	Ass.
1447539	1448980	There's something in the air tonight.
1449361	1451902	It's a little too much eggnog going around for everybody.
1451962	1452142	Yes, ass.
1452323	1452803	I think.
1454124	1454444	Anyway.
1454784	1455765	Dude, I had alcohol.
1455845	1456525	Even a little bit.
1456586	1460568	Even when you cook all the alcohol out, I still react to it like giggly.
1460889	1463891	It's going to... I cooked tonight, too.
1464171	1464511	Oh, yeah.
1464531	1465212	Back to last night.
1466632	1467293	Preparation.
1469261	1470422	Stop reading the chat room.
1470442	1471702	They're too immature tonight.
1471762	1473443	They don't deserve to be looked at.
1473843	1479646	Well, we just could not decide on what to eat, so finally Ross is all, we're just going to go to a hometown buffet.
1480406	1480626	Ew!
1482207	1482427	Ew!
1482907	1489030	So we went to like the... I've been to a couple of different hometown buffets and they were all kind of okay, you know.
1489430	1491671	We went to the one on the ass end of White Avenue.
1493172	1494812	And I literally do mean the ass end.
1494872	1496273	It's like up there by Walmart.
1497199	1507948	Which, to anybody who's not in this area, has no idea what you're talking about It's like the ghetto side of it If anyone has ever been in Sacramento, if you're going up past where McClellan was
1508826	1509666	It's up in the ass.
1509706	1512027	So basically you went to a hometown buffet in the ghetto.
1512287	1512547	Yes.
1512767	1513147	Okay.
1513947	1517688	And there were the people there saying, after this we're going to go get some entertainment over at Walmart.
1518748	1519248	Okay, whatever.
1520648	1522529	So, uh, I ate a bunch of food.
1522849	1523349	It was yummy.
1524809	1526050	Of the temple of butt.
1526390	1527070	Oh no, I'm sorry.
1527090	1527950	Stop reading chat.
1528170	1528510	Stop.
1528690	1529250	I command you.
1530010	1530591	Bite me.
1530611	1532191	Mmm, potato.
1533530	1534151	Get on Ass Cloud Style
1556496	1560038	Okay, weekday, hometown buffet.
1560058	1567702	Yeah, so we came back, watched Rejected, and Hedvig, I am a banana.
1567722	1572204	What?
1572684	1578147	My Rejected DVD was part of the settlement in my last relationship.
1578367	1578447	Oh.
1579275	1586117	I made out with a third style, fourth style, and a DDR pad, and he made out with a rejected DVD, so it was a fair trade.
1587617	1591538	Well, we watched Rejected, and then we watched Hedwig and the Angry Inch.
1592538	1593158	I love that movie.
1593738	1594559	And then I went home.
1595119	1597099	And then today, I sat on my ass and did nothing.
1598280	1602341	Well, okay, I went to the grocery store to buy cream, and Dan's like, buy me some ice cream.
1603421	1603881	Okay.
1605387	1609929	She sat around watching Return of the King, which I don't want to watch because I think Gollum is retarded.
1610930	1612891	There is something weird about that guy.
1613291	1616973	Well, of course he's meant to be creepy, but he actually turns my stomach.
1617853	1621395	Although I did manage to peek down for some of the Legolas scenes, so that was cool.
1621415	1622696	It's like, ooh, elf man.
1623856	1630199	And so I came up here early before the show, about the time pre-show started, and I cooked.
1631280	1631800	Yes, you did.
1632381	1638029	I made these kebabs with shrimp and scallops topped with lobster tail.
1645023	1649604	Green beans cooked in butter and herbs with cream sauce to coat.
1649644	1654486	And I'm actually putting the recipe for the cream sauce in my live journal for anyone who goes to live journal.
1654526	1655506	Only my friends can see it.
1656046	1656926	So you're the lucky few.
1656946	1659987	Well, you could always put it in the Orange Lounge community because the Orange Lounge community needs something.
1660007	1660807	I don't like them.
1661207	1661708	Why?
1661868	1662248	Kidding.
1664349	1665929	I'll let someone else repost it for me.
1666510	1672993	But basically I made this amaretto cream sauce to go over it.
1673113	1684139	Normally when I make green beans I go for the Italian style spicy or I'll do it up Cajun style.
1684239	1685760	I went for sweet cream this time.
1686480	1687521	And I had garlic in it.
1687987	1689950	Jamie let me eat her sweet cream.
1690390	1691091	And it was good.
1692013	1698261	But I had garlic in it and some pepper and amaretto and butter and cream.
1699743	1701686	There's a lot of ingredients in Jamie's sweet cream.
1702410	1703170	Okay, whatever.
1704631	1709493	But I am like, I just pulled this recipe right out of my ass and it tended to be really good.
1709973	1710853	I keep saying ass.
1710893	1713314	What is with the ass fixation with you people tonight?
1713494	1714934	Is everybody gay?
1715234	1717255	This is my normal phrasing, okay?
1717675	1719476	And the chat room is imitating me.
1719936	1721077	Pay me some rent, bitches.
1722457	1723197	I love you guys.
1723897	1724178	A little.
1726778	1727079	I'm done.
1727499	1727919	Oh, you're done?
1728550	1729551	Yeah, I'm done.
1729811	1731112	Wait, but whatever happened?
1731232	1732954	There were no fun stories about Hometown Buffet?
1732994	1733835	You kind of glossed right over it.
1733855	1734976	None of the people scared me there.
1735016	1738679	The guy in painter overalls with the beer belly.
1739139	1741101	You know, I heard that there were... He's pregnant.
1741261	1746546	I heard that there are people out there that will go to Hometown Buffet in the morning and then stay there all day long.
1747062	1751965	I think they have a policy where they kick them out because they have to change the dinners and everything in between.
1752005	1753226	Well, that's the smart thing to do.
1754227	1755628	Can you imagine that?
1755788	1759791	One of these nights where we have to go to the buffet over at Thunder Valley.
1761172	1762193	That is a good buffet.
1762553	1763013	You know what?
1763093	1766856	It's a little slice of Vegas right here in our backyard.
1766876	1770558	We need to do that the night before New Year's Eve.
1771859	1772860	Do like the Orange Lounge.
1773080	1774101	We can bring the tape recorder.
1774401	1775181	We could do something like that.
1775482	1776062	We should do that.
1776242	1777002	Okay, I'm down with that.
1777022	1779723	It's like pre-New Year's Eve, eat a whole bunch of sugar-a-thon.
1779863	1780784	Alright, sounds good.
1781004	1781464	Alright, I'm done.
1781624	1782625	Alright, uh, Loki!
1784445	1786026	Okay, Loki's eating, so we're gonna go to Angel.
1786106	1786726	Angel, how was your week?
1786746	1787106	How was your day?
1788127	1793729	Played a little bit of Imani this week, uh, 7th style, just cause I haven't bought 8th style yet.
1794429	1800312	But, uh, I kinda gave up after, like, a couple songs, cause my controller's being a pain in the butt.
1801750	1805193	Honestly, like, it's just sticking and being a pain.
1805253	1809657	And it's going to turn out like Rob's controller if I don't be careful, so I need to do something about that.
1810537	1819325	And also, I found a new Korean game addiction that I should probably talk about later, because I don't know if you guys are going to say it's going to suck or not.
1820406	1820786	Hey!
1822347	1828833	Okay, the only thing I'm going to give away for now is that it's a mix between, like,
1829938	1858389	Ragnarok meets Final Fantasy meets Commander Keen and I'll tell you right now I ain't leaving Final Fantasy for it because you don't want to know how many people have told me this week Rob, join World of Warcraft no, Rob, join World of Warcraft no, I've worked too hard on Final Fantasy XI I'm probably going to be playing World of Warcraft fuck you, seriously if I have time love you Dan's probably going to be playing World of Warcraft I miss your Mithra I miss her you want to play for my account?
1858410	1859350	I'll play again hell no
1862671	1863692	Didn't miss her that much.
1863992	1865533	She's only level, what, seven?
1866594	1867794	And I played for three months?
1867974	1868475	Four months?
1869916	1870736	You know I'm teasing.
1873318	1875079	Um, anyway, off track.
1875920	1876320	Oh, yeah.
1876940	1878901	And then I got finals this week, but that's beside the point.
1879302	1880262	Other than that, no school.
1880422	1880883	Yay!
1882544	1882844	Alright.
1883825	1884645	Loki, ready to talk?
1885766	1888288	You got enough potato down where you can talk here?
1888508	1890129	Starchy, how was your week?
1890149	1890529	How was your day?
1891618	1895541	This is my really starchy, really full of sodium meal.
1896822	1898563	That's really good for me, I'm sure.
1899424	1901786	Anyways, how'd this week go?
1902006	1903867	Oh yeah, first went to a funeral.
1904888	1905368	That was fun.
1905889	1908351	Got to see lots of family, but there was ham, so that was good.
1910512	1918198	And then... You talking about ham makes me think of this thing that was in the Christmas present that you got me.
1919139	1920180	Did I tell you about this?
1921632	1922493	I'll talk about it later.
1922853	1923814	After the kids go to bed.
1923874	1924654	Later in the show.
1926756	1927096	God.
1927276	1927676	Anyways.
1929557	1934100	So then, after that, Wednesday, I didn't do anything.
1935561	1939284	Thursday, I took the day off to take my car down to get the brakes fixed.
1939744	1942566	That was wonderful because it's done now.
1943767	1944967	Play lots of Final Fantasy.
1944987	1948650	I was going to work on the cabinet.
1949190	1950531	I actually did work on the cabinet.
1951288	1961476	and my DDR pads create too much static electricity and it ends up temporarily shorting out the IPEC every time I use them.
1962918	1966420	So I gotta modify them again, slightly, hopefully.
1967381	1968422	And hopefully that'll fix it.
1969483	1971705	If not, I gotta chuck them.
1972245	1973006	That makes me sad.
1974026	1974447	But, um...
1975683	1986167	Yeah, so I worked on that and lots of Final Fantasy and I had to make cookies for tomorrow at work because our boss volunteered us.
1987267	1989288	You had to make cookies or your mom had to make cookies?
1990188	1991128	I had to make cookies.
1992029	1992609	Impressive.
1993369	1994529	Shit, it's just cookies.
1995050	1995730	Did you toss them?
1997410	1998611	No, I did not toss the cookies.
2000471	2002272	So yeah, he volunteered us to do this.
2003447	2004528	and none of us wanted to do it.
2004829	2009232	And then he's like, yeah, we'll do it as a team, but I'm not going to do it.
2010794	2013676	So, you know, I ended up having to make cookies and they looked like nipples.
2017019	2021022	And I also sold some other cookies for my mom's house.
2021963	2024385	And there's some that look like croissants that are pretty good.
2024405	2025886	Those are good.
2026226	2029709	And I ate all the butter cookies that she had, she gave me.
2030270	2031911	So, oh, so good.
2034204	2036385	Oh, and I saw Blade Trinity yesterday, and that was good.
2038566	2041807	I just didn't really care anymore, but Ryan Reynolds made it funny.
2041828	2045309	Because Wesley Snipes, just eh.
2045750	2047931	But Ryan Reynolds being a jackass, that was good.
2050232	2050512	That's all.
2052250	2054251	Ryan Reynolds is Alanis Morissette's fiancee.
2054551	2054971	Did you know that?
2055732	2055972	I did.
2056092	2056612	How sad is that?
2057532	2059333	You're the resident Alanis fan.
2059433	2060013	I totally am.
2060414	2063115	That was the music I was listening to before Bomani, and still really.
2063275	2065276	I mean, I can't listen to DDR music 24-7.
2065556	2066777	I don't know how some people out there do that.
2067037	2078002	And I know it's ironic considering the radio station that we do, but even in the radio station we do, I think we have enough diversions away from the normal playlist where even if you listen to our station 24-7, you wouldn't be hearing Bomani 24-7.
2079322	2080723	I like listening to other music once in a while.
2081443	2083564	We can hear a lot of that randomness on Jamie's show.
2083904	2090088	If you ever wondered why does Jamie's show exist on a video gaming network when she plays complete random stuff, that's why.
2090348	2092710	Because you can't listen to gaming music 24-7, I'm sorry.
2093450	2095791	You gotta appreciate the other music that's out there once in a while.
2095851	2100334	So, Jamie is your music appreciation speaker.
2101014	2103736	Just like with all the gamers, once in a while you need to go outside.
2106055	2107376	Anyway, my week of my day was pretty good.
2107856	2109938	I just played a lot of Final Fantasy myself.
2110959	2112099	I went out last night.
2112119	2113540	I went out to the bar, which was good.
2113560	2116763	It was the first time that my buddy, since he'd been out of the hospital, got to go.
2116803	2117323	We had a good time.
2117363	2120926	I drank a little bit and met some people.
2121046	2123187	I like it when strangers randomly come up and talk to me.
2123207	2125329	And there was this girl there who was just like Karen.
2125728	2129090	from Will and Grace, and that made me love her, because, you know, I love Karen on that show.
2129110	2131671	If you guys watch Will and Grace, you know it's all about Karen on that show.
2132851	2134012	He knows what I'm talking about.
2134952	2137653	And then, you know, I've been doing a lot of stuff at work.
2137693	2147698	I've been busy, busy at work, and it's kind of funny you talk about your boss making you all do this, you know, cooking thing, because we're doing something similar in my work right now, where, you know, we're doing all these winter events.
2148038	2149359	And you have to be politically correct.
2149399	2151119	You can't say Christmas stuff.
2151540	2153300	It's holiday stuff.
2153621	2156882	So we had a holiday ornament decoration contest and everybody had to participate.
2156902	2160864	Well, you didn't have to, but everybody was supposed to participate in.
2162156	2170100	And I was so busy teaching, because that's what I do at my job, I teach, I was so busy that I did not have a chance to decorate my ornament until about two minutes before.
2170520	2178785	So what I did is I printed out a picture of SpongeBob SquarePants' face from the internet, and then I pasted it on the ornament and colored it in yellow highlighter, and it looked pretty.
2178805	2180566	It was a SpongeBob ornament, and it was awesome.
2181526	2184368	And people liked it, though, so, you know, I get points for that.
2185088	2188370	And tomorrow I have to decorate my cube, so what can I say?
2188703	2190627	What is this you're showing in LiveJournal right now?
2190988	2191308	Kitty.
2192150	2193012	It's a puppy!
2193292	2193814	Oh, it's a puppy?
2193834	2195056	It looks like a kitty from back here.
2195156	2195898	It's a Sheltie.
2196279	2196699	Oh, okay.
2197802	2199625	Thank you for totally derailing this segment.
2202055	2208920	Also, earlier this week, I picked up Final Fantasy Dawn of Souls, which is Final Fantasy 1 and 2 on the Game Boy Advance, and I can't stop playing it.
2209240	2221689	I haven't even touched Final Fantasy 2 yet, I've just been playing Final Fantasy 1, because they totally redid it, they made the battle system more like 4, and just, everything is more like Final Fantasy 4, but, you know, with Final Fantasy 1's story, and it's awesome.
2221809	2223771	I highly recommend it, if you're a Final Fantasy fan.
2224011	2230215	And the great part is, I will sit there, and while I wait for a party in Final Fantasy 11, I'll play Final Fantasy 1 on my DS.
2230575	2230755	So...
2231624	2233965	I'm just a total Final Fantasy whore lately.
2234545	2235125	But that's okay.
2235705	2236085	I'm allowed.
2237246	2238846	Alright, so that's pretty much my week and my day.
2239766	2239966	So.
2241427	2242887	Uh, we're gonna move right along here.
2242987	2252150	You know what's going on tonight, right now, actually, right now, and I hate talking about reasons for you to leave Orange Lounge Radio because you should be listening to our show, you know, all the time.
2252810	2253230	However...
2254505	2256486	This is as good of an excuse as any, I figure.
2256506	2259788	If you've got to go, I mean, this would be something I would want to listen to, too.
2260569	2262570	MidiHead, you know, we had him on the show a couple weeks ago.
2263030	2266833	He's doing a live spinning thing right now where he's debuting some new material and stuff.
2266853	2270115	It's actually going on right now over on www.midihead.com.
2270135	2272757	I'm trying to work out something where maybe we can play it later.
2273657	2284004	So I'm hoping I can hear it a little later, but, you know, if you're a fan of MidiHead and he's a great guy, I know there's a lot of fans out there, you probably would want to check that out at some point, but, you know.
2284810	2285890	I'll be sad if you leave.
2287011	2289251	But no, you gotta support all internet radio, so, you know.
2290072	2290592	Do what you gotta do.
2290672	2291692	No, you're not leaving, Loki.
2292432	2292913	You're stuck.
2292933	2293693	You're under contract.
2295633	2296894	Alright, yeah.
2297014	2298694	It's a contract sealed with blood.
2300815	2303116	You get paid in meat.
2306077	2306397	Alright.
2309107	2310047	We're going to go to a break.
2310087	2312968	When we come back from the break, we'll talk about some more stuff going on in the Bomani scene.
2313668	2315188	I want to take a call over Skype.
2315208	2318949	There's actually a couple calls I want to do over Skype tonight, but I've got one I want to do right when we come back.
2319549	2326991	Somebody said something very interesting in our chat room, and it has to do with remixes, and it has to do with you, Loki.
2327811	2330691	I'm going to have him call in and talk about that when we come back from this break.
2331091	2332992	In this break, I promised a fun theme.
2333012	2338793	We're going to do happy music, and this is a lot of happy music that was suggested to us by folks in the chat room.
2339628	2345250	no happy music yes happy music we'll be back here we go
2469814	2484578	I thought a little bit of you today Look how I felt without myself for you Look a little bit at me today You know you gotta try a little harder So you can be my, my, my, my darling Smile, a little smile, let's enjoy the moment
2525645	2528308	Thank you for watching!
2548567	2569080	All you need is love, my love, my love, my love, my love, my love, my love, my love, my love, my love, my love, my love, my love, my love, my love, my love, my love, my love, my love, my love, my love, my love, my love, my love, my love, my love.
2606662	2608844	Hey, don't forgive me for hurting you.
2608985	2610406	I'm smiling at you.
2610546	2612368	I can't go home anymore.
2612408	2614430	The sweet scent of time is falling.
2614590	2615051	It repeats.
2692193	2693534	Thank you for watching!
2715646	2717407	Bitch, get a new song.
2718067	2720548	An open letter from Orange Lounge Radio.
2720848	2722089	We are back here on Orange Lounge.
2722109	2722869	Whoops, no we're not.
2722889	2723329	There we are.
2725610	2726771	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
2726791	2729192	Yeah, that was the very first promo, I think.
2730913	2732513	Me and the ex actually did that one.
2733254	2735215	You can hear the ex singing in that one.
2736155	2739176	I refused to participate in that one.
2740217	2741277	No sing-along for Jamie.
2741297	2742538	I did do the solitary voice.
2746437	2748438	I remember we came up with that one in your car.
2751338	2752239	I'll play the other one later.
2752339	2753659	It was another one we came up with too.
2754059	2754939	It was really all you.
2755479	2756200	Actually, it was Dan.
2756640	2756880	Really.
2757500	2763121	Yeah, the take on me one.
2764262	2765162	We'll get that in a little later.
2765922	2773327	Alright, during the break there, Loki was booting up Step Mania because he wanted to show me some dancing characters in Step Mania.
2773347	2775469	I guess there's some new characters that hit the internet this week.
2775509	2778251	What's going on with Step Mania's dancing characters?
2778811	2781573	I didn't think there was a scene for character creation, but apparently there is.
2782574	2783615	Well, there's some funny ones.
2784595	2789218	Vivi from Final Fantasy IX was in there as one of the dancing characters.
2789279	2793381	And then a really crappy done Maria from Silent Hill 3, is it?
2794362	2795543	It doesn't look like Maria, but whatever.
2795945	2797826	Anyway, so those are available.
2798326	2805228	I can't remember where they are, though, because the link was on DDR Maniacs, but that site's been down for a few days now.
2805989	2807529	But they're out there.
2808430	2809170	God, I can't remember.
2809190	2810730	I don't know.
2810750	2812511	It's a site that has a bunch of stuff on there.
2813892	2817553	They did a bunch of... Crap, I can't remember.
2817753	2819914	It's the same site that hosts all the official ones.
2819954	2823435	They have one that the guy has been ripping them from 5th Mix and 3rd Mix now.
2824076	2825157	Master Chief Master Chief
2842065	2845767	And the song that Loki was playing was some sim file for I'm Your Boogeyman by Xtreme.
2846187	2849828	And I could just picture the Master Chief going, I'm your boogeyman, I'm your boogeyman.
2849908	2852029	It's just a really amazing image.
2852389	2854050	But the Vivi one was really good.
2854530	2857411	That was pretty, I mean, it's not perfect, but it's hilarious.
2857491	2858912	It gets the job done.
2859232	2860012	It's fun to watch.
2860072	2861413	So, definitely check that out.
2861453	2866655	If anybody in our chatroom happens to know where those characters are hosted, feel free to post it in chat.
2867015	2871077	Again, it was on DDR Maniacs, but... But, um...
2874542	2877506	We had a little glitch there on Live 365.
2877546	2878347	Comcast farted.
2878467	2880250	What we're going to do, I don't know if it was Comcast.
2880290	2881772	No, I don't think it was that.
2881812	2883654	I just think it was a station fart.
2883735	2887420	We're going to go to a quick break just to make sure folks have a chance to reconnect.
2887460	2888441	I hate it when that stuff happens.
2888762	2890144	We'll be right back after this, guys.
2943106	2944387	Thank you for watching!
3000015	3001696	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
3001716	3002217	Sorry about that.
3002257	3004218	We had some kind of station hiccup.
3004278	3004938	Something happened.
3005439	3006499	It happens once in a while.
3007080	3008521	Live 365 or something.
3008541	3011623	There was a faulty connection between our house and Live 365.
3011703	3014484	Either a hiccup on our end or a hiccup on their end.
3015685	3020649	I know Live 365 was doing a bunch of maintenance yesterday, so all the Live 365 stations were down.
3021069	3026153	We were down, DDR Freak Radio, Understation Live, all the Live 365 stations were down yesterday.
3026614	3032358	So maybe something's going on with that, I don't know, but we do appear that we are back.
3032698	3041225	Remember, if you ever miss any or all of a show, any part, all of whatever, you can hear the show in its entirety on DDR Freak Radio Live.
3041505	3044826	Friday nights, 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time is when that airs.
3045626	3046466	It's going to be interesting, though.
3046486	3050267	I have no idea how that hiccup is going to translate into the archive.
3050347	3053607	I think it just keeps right on going, so you'll hear us going, Crap!
3053627	3054407	Station down!
3055308	3056208	All hands on deck!
3058488	3058808	Weird.
3059108	3060288	So I don't know what's going on with that.
3060328	3068990	Anyway, before we got dropped there, we were talking about new dancing characters in Step Mania, and it looks like Loki found the site where you can actually get those dancing characters from, right?
3069912	3071093	Well, it's not this site.
3071133	3073494	I thought it was the same site, but it doesn't look like it is.
3073875	3075876	It was PlasmaDance.com was where some of them were.
3076497	3082481	Okay, so some of them are on there, PlasmaDance.com, so you can check that out if you are curious about it.
3082521	3084082	Does it have the Master Chief?
3084102	3085723	Because that's the one people really have to get.
3085743	3086523	No.
3087564	3088205	Oh, it doesn't?
3088245	3089105	Well, forget it then.
3089926	3090686	Don't waste your time.
3091247	3091787	I'm just kidding.
3092087	3093228	There's a lot of good ones on there, though.
3093868	3094889	Alright.
3096590	3098071	Wow, trying to get back on track here.
3098411	3098532	Um...
3099437	3117147	Let's see, what I wanted to do now is I wanted to actually go to the phones on the Skype line, and if you want to participate in the Skype line, just go to our website, www.orangeloundtrader.com, and click on Interact With Us, and it's got all the details on how you can actually interact with the program.
3117207	3126612	And actually, there's a specific person I'm looking to hear from that I'm hoping will be calling us in a minute here, because he was talking about something in chat earlier.
3127617	3130038	So we're going to open up the Skype line so he can get through.
3130639	3134381	So I'm specifically looking for the person I have a prearranged phone interview with.
3134481	3136082	So if you're somebody else, don't worry.
3136102	3137663	You'll have an opportunity to call him to the show later.
3139144	3140305	Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
3141845	3144727	Hey, is my phone on?
3144947	3146128	You're fading out there a little bit.
3146168	3149430	Make sure all your other transfers and your bandwidth is open there.
3150170	3150631	Can you hear us?
3152712	3153052	Hello.
3153772	3154013	Hello.
3154333	3154473	Hi.
3154513	3154573	Hi.
3156756	3157316	Am I okay?
3157656	3158537	I think so.
3158637	3159837	We'll just keep going with this.
3159877	3160318	Who is this?
3161238	3162358	This is John Fields.
3162639	3163539	Hi, John Fields.
3163559	3163999	How are you?
3164900	3165600	I'm doing fine.
3165820	3166120	All right.
3166160	3167841	What did you call in to talk to us about tonight?
3167981	3169001	By OC Remix.
3169441	3169842	You know what?
3170122	3170462	Right now.
3259500	3264922	Yeah, that song's kind of fitting right now, a little gentle stress being caused by faulty internet connections.
3264962	3266842	We're going to keep going with this best we can, guys.
3267603	3269263	I don't know what to tell you, though, about that.
3270824	3271944	I don't know if it's on our end.
3272044	3275565	I don't think it's on our end, because we haven't been having any internet problems for a long time now.
3275585	3282548	I know we used to have a lot of problems with internet here, but ever since the really cool tech guy came out, we haven't really been having problems, have we, Loki?
3283508	3283908	No, it's...
3285049	3287612	Yeah, the real cool tech guy came out and just used pliers.
3287693	3289675	Something I could have done in like three seconds.
3289875	3290536	You know what?
3290576	3291638	He thought of it and you didn't.
3291678	3292339	That's the point.
3293280	3297125	Well, I can't help it if he's more experienced with their faulty equipment.
3297626	3298827	So, yeah.
3298947	3301971	Anyway, again, if you missed all our part, you can always tune into...
3303854	3305035	And now we're having sound issues.
3305115	3307477	My God, if enough stuff wouldn't break around here.
3309378	3312761	Again, you can always tune in to DDR Free Radio to hear the archive in full.
3313641	3319526	Along with other live programming that goes on throughout the week here on Orange Lounge Radio, which usually doesn't get affected by this kind of stuff.
3319546	3323288	You can tune in to Pump Up the Volume on Tuesday nights, hosted by the lovely Dark Sakura.
3324129	3327291	Monday nights, Diversion, Orange Lounge Radio, Bomani Remixes.
3327952	3329473	And Thursday nights...
3330242	3335745	Outside the Box, which will be in reruns this week, actually, because I'm going to be out this week.
3336165	3338146	I'm going to be out and about in L.A.
3338206	3338947	I'm actually going to L.A.
3338967	3339187	this week.
3339207	3347711	I was kind of hoping that I'd get to go to Arcade Infinity while I was down in L.A., but it doesn't look like that's going to happen, because me and four coworkers actually have to share a car.
3347771	3348392	Doesn't that suck?
3350373	3351573	A tremendous amount of ass.
3351634	3355255	However, there's a good noodle place over there by A.I.
3356696	3357877	You can suggest going there for dinner.
3358615	3359535	Maybe, I don't know.
3360476	3361796	It's really, really a good place.
3361816	3363937	We'll have to see.
3364657	3366338	Alright, more to do.
3367958	3369639	And we're still getting sound issues.
3369659	3370880	This is bad.
3370920	3371540	I'm sorry, guys.
3373481	3374221	Everything's breaking.
3375546	3376386	We keep going down.
3376867	3377907	We're going to call it a show.
3379308	3380289	I'm getting pretty pissy here.
3380949	3381309	We'll see.
3381909	3382370	We'll keep going.
3382390	3383190	Let's go get sushi.
3383670	3384191	Seriously?
3384211	3385091	I'm like, mmm, food.
3385111	3395177	Alright, let's go to another break and just kind of hope things are good when we come back and we'll try calling John again and get out some more Bomani news and just keep doing what we do here.
3395577	3397738	So we'll be back after this little break here.
3398378	3401940	I think we'll do that Silent Hill break I was talking about earlier.
3402541	3403121	So we'll be back.
3403861	3405222	Happy holidays to everybody out there.
3432880	3434608	Thank you for watching!
3517876	3518857	Thank you for watching!
3539938	3549022	It would be a much better fight With you, with me If you hadn't met me I'd be fine on my own, baby Never felt so lonely when you came along
3558986	3560707	So now what should I do?
3560867	3568789	I'm strung out, addicted to you My body aches, now that you're gone My supplies fell through Let me give me everything you have
3579552	3580393	Thank you for watching!
3624705	3637449	I hope you're drinking and toasting It's such a special day Tonight, tonight, oh, I love you
3653263	3660410	Christmas is here, Christmas is here Night, nightfall, I love you
3708287	3711689	We often wonder how some of those Bomani songs are chosen.
3717833	3718955	We think we figured it out.
3718975	3720076	Orange Lounge Radio.
3720096	3720557	Hi, we're back.
3735959	3737220	And hopefully things are stable.
3737360	3741083	I think the internet is just completely fucked tonight, basically, is what it boils down to.
3741103	3748389	Because I notice people keep dropping from our chat room, left and right, and the Skype chat a little bit earlier was really kind of freaky.
3748769	3750151	So, we're under attack!
3750791	3752192	The internet is screwed!
3752853	3753793	I don't know what's going on.
3754434	3755595	The internet's on vacation.
3756436	3757977	I cannot find anything on this damn game.
3758390	3758550	Hello?
3758570	3759091	Hi, John, you there?
3785626	3785806	Yep.
3786067	3787588	Good, and you sound a lot better this time.
3788049	3789631	Okay, I think the internet might be fixed.
3790392	3790652	Okay.
3790792	3791213	We'll see.
3791413	3792414	Anyway, from the top.
3792795	3796139	So, you were in the Overclocked Remix channel this week.
3796899	3797100	Yep.
3797340	3798802	And you were asking about fusion mixes.
3799784	3815249	Right, I was wondering, after what came out today, which was, I believe, another B4U remix or something like that, I was wondering if maybe we could try getting Loki's remixes in there just for fun.
3815329	3820150	Well, first you've got to talk Loki into it, because he's pretty protective over his material there.
3822429	3824610	Well, I spoke with one of the higher-ups today.
3826231	3826791	The higher-up?
3826871	3831334	Is there an OC hierarchy or something?
3831414	3832554	The Trump of OC?
3832594	3833415	Okay, no, I'm kidding.
3834435	3842420	Basically, what it is, is it's like most of the chat channel users are unvoiced, and the higher-ups, they are voiced.
3843000	3843260	Okay.
3843300	3847622	And then there's pretty much DJ Pretzel and then a couple of bots, I think, up at top.
3847942	3848203	Okay.
3849303	3849963	Okay, gotcha.
3850564	3850884	And I was...
3851383	3854846	Wow, now how many DDR remixes are on OC Remix?
3855787	3856608	Not a lot, right?
3856628	3859611	Yeah, it's like three or four right now, I think.
3873615	3874316	What do you say, Loki?
3875337	3876579	Oh, he's looking at the site right now.
3878081	3879683	He's sizing it up.
3879924	3880164	What?
3880785	3882827	There's a request for more Bimani, actually.
3882847	3884870	There's a request for more Bimani.
3884970	3886432	Loki, I'm moving the mic over to you.
3886452	3886993	What do you think of this?
3888755	3889837	I don't know.
3892168	3893529	Now, see, I like OC Remix.
3893589	3894189	It's a good site.
3894229	3895990	There's a lot of really good remixes on there.
3896311	3898052	I think it would be pretty exciting if you got it on there.
3898372	3899012	And you know what?
3899172	3905536	Yet again, you could just continue to kick those people who say that Fusion remixes are not real remixes.
3905836	3919745	I mean, not only did you get MidiHead, who actually has a song in DDR on here a couple weeks ago, saying he used his ass in his mixes, but then you could get one of these mixes on OC Remix and you would just, you know, you would have the hugest internet penis.
3919985	3920726	I mean, seriously.
3921586	3922767	Almost as big as Jason's.
3923127	3929589	I don't think it would fall, I think under the fact, if I remember correctly, I don't think it would be allowed, actually.
3929609	3938993	Yeah, no, I don't think it would work.
3940214	3947817	You don't think it would work because of the fact that you mix your songs with other songs that are already out there, so you're kind of using too much commercial music, is that what you think the problem is?
3949588	3955153	Yeah, it's copyright music, because I have no permission from the original artist.
3956754	3959357	But, I mean, I don't know.
3959697	3963400	There are songs on there that have remixed licensed songs, I think.
3963721	3967444	I think there's like a Jingle Bells on there, mixed with Super Mario World, I think.
3969106	3971428	Yeah, but Jingle Bells is public domain.
3972449	3972869	I think so.
3973770	3975031	Wait, maybe, I don't know.
3975430	3978091	Even the happy birthday song is not public domain, if you can believe that.
3978251	3981732	You know every time you sing the happy birthday song, you're supposed to give some guy a quarter, basically?
3982132	3984273	Well, not really, but you know, happy birthday is a copyrighted song.
3984853	3986874	Alright, Loki's gonna look into it, John.
3987174	3988254	That's the most we can do for you.
3988914	3989515	Okay.
3989615	3991155	I'm hoping he'll do it.
3991195	3991895	I think it would be good.
3992616	3992876	Alright.
3993136	3995257	I'm all for whoring out the show everywhere possible.
3996297	3996577	You know.
3996637	3998938	Thanks for looking out for us, so keep us posted.
3999578	3999918	Okay.
4000078	4000598	Alright, later.
4001359	4001579	Bye.
4001639	4001839	Bye.
4003755	4005336	Our chat room is being a bunch of babies again.
4006496	4009397	They're complaining because the webcam isn't showing anything.
4010658	4013479	Angel, go sit on the couch so they have someone to look at.
4016220	4019121	I'm forcing Angel to go sit on the couch so you have someone to look at.
4020421	4022102	That was my impression of the chat room.
4022362	4025623	It doesn't say that you can't, so I guess you could.
4026483	4028584	I could submit it because it doesn't say that you can't.
4028664	4031225	It's not in their submission guideline things here.
4031832	4035816	All it says is that, you know, you have to be the original artist of, you know, whatever it is.
4036636	4038198	But it doesn't say you can't.
4039078	4043102	Um, well... Okay, I don't know.
4044663	4047046	The worst that could happen is they call you a lamer.
4047286	4047786	Honestly.
4049428	4051369	What's the worst that could happen if you submitted a song?
4053211	4053711	I don't know.
4054832	4057895	I'm trying to talk him into doing it, but he's being a pussy.
4059321	4068144	Alright, anyway, moving right along, what's this stuff, you were talking during the break there, you were reading some various Bomani sites, finding out something going on with Poppin' Music?
4068244	4076766	Poppin' Music Iroha, which I don't know crap about because I wasn't keeping up with Poppin' Music, but apparently Poppin' Music Iroha was out last week, so.
4078426	4079587	And is that just Poppin' Music 12?
4079787	4083088	I don't, yeah, I think so.
4083108	4083208	Is it?
4083228	4083488	Alright.
4084403	4084783	Hooray!
4084843	4086044	Another poppin' music!
4086104	4087525	Just what we need right now, you know?
4087946	4089286	No, actually, I like poppin' music.
4090107	4094330	Good time, but... I would pull up... God, I wish they'd make a new DDR.
4094730	4100474	On my laptop, but I still need to install the Japanese language patch, so... Alright.
4101435	4103416	What do you say we get into a cage match for tonight?
4104257	4104677	Sure!
4104917	4108660	Alright, let's cue up the music, then.
4111138	4112819	Who's going to go first in tonight's cage match?
4112839	4116000	You know we had to retire somebody last week, so now we get to go in whatever order we want.
4116040	4116961	Why don't you start, Rob?
4117241	4117941	I get to start?
4118081	4118482	Oh, goody.
4120382	4120723	Hold on.
4122043	4122323	Alright.
4123224	4129327	The way the cage match works, boys and girls, each host brings to the table one song and you guys will vote.
4130336	4156259	On your favorite song, which will go into rotation all week long On Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Music and More program Which plays 24 hours a day, 7 days a week on this station When there's no live program So, last week in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, we retired a song It has won for a month straight, meaning it's gone Here it is, a final send-off for Gwen Stefani, Whatcha Waitin' For
4197435	4200636	All right, everybody say goodbye to Gwen Stefani.
4200756	4202456	She is being retired.
4204389	4207891	Alright, so we're going to go ahead and say goodbye to Gwen Stefani.
4211513	4214015	Alright, she is retired from the Orange Lens Radio Cage Match.
4214315	4217497	Alright, so that means you guys get three brand new songs tonight.
4217557	4219498	Jamie has decided that I'm going to go first.
4220436	4223237	I declare this as official woman of Orange Lounge Radio.
4223297	4224438	Okay, fair enough.
4224738	4225758	I have the chair.
4226459	4226899	Fair enough.
4227179	4231481	Alright, my song, and how appropriate what my song is tonight.
4232241	4234762	I'm going to have to dedicate this one to Jamie for that comment.
4237743	4238904	Okay, I'm going to eat clean beef.
4239372	4251097	My song is a song called Bitch, and it's by a group called J-Punch, and it's from this Trance Anthems compilation I found, and I liked it.
4251397	4256439	So here it is, song number one in tonight's cage match that you can vote for, Bitch, the open air remix.
4256499	4256799	Enjoy.
4273037	4274898	And I hate myself And I try You're a bitch You're a bitch
4444591	4448672	Song number one in tonight's cage match, Bitch, the open air remix by J-Punch.
4449372	4449892	Jamie!
4451573	4453953	It was pretty good, I have to say.
4454414	4457094	A lot more energetic than most trance you play.
4457114	4459155	I think it's an eight.
4460475	4461355	And you are a bitch.
4462476	4463276	I'm being serious!
4463296	4464716	I'm just kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
4465436	4466497	I'm offended!
4466697	4467697	No, I love you, Jamie.
4469281	4469521	Angel!
4469601	4472344	I'll give it an eight and a half.
4472364	4472784	That's pretty cool.
4472824	4473045	Alright.
4473085	4473185	Loki!
4473205	4473585	This is okay.
4473625	4474226	Eight and a half.
4491881	4493643	I give it an 8.
4494123	4503591	I mean, honestly, I didn't think you guys would like that one at all, and it looks like our chatroom doesn't, so it probably doesn't have much of a chance, but even though it's a little repetitive, I like songs that say bitch.
4503711	4504311	What can I say?
4505492	4506573	So it gets 8 points for that.
4506913	4508855	Alright, let's move on to Jamie's pick.
4508875	4509856	Jamie, what'd you pick tonight?
4511094	4517958	I chose a song that I'm sure everyone's probably heard, but it just really suited my mood for the past week or so.
4519119	4522000	It's Delirium with Sarah McLachlan, Silence.
4523141	4526723	And it just really, it's very, very somber.
4527364	4529325	Alright, so a mood-fitting one.
4529905	4536529	Yeah, and really, I just put it in because I've been listening to it just off and on all week, so...
4538576	4539976	Alright, let's hear it.
4540016	4541097	Delirium with silence.
4541177	4541597	Enjoy.
4541617	4545718	Delirium with silence.
4637984	4640465	Lyrics, Lyrics, Lyrics, Lyrics
4714123	4715150	DarkSakura.com
4791234	4796598	All right, that was song number two in tonight's cage match, courtesy of DarkSakura, Delirium, with Sarah McLachlan, Silence.
4797697	4798357	Jamie, what'd you think?
4798997	4799738	I love that song.
4799898	4807540	Like I said, I've been listening to it a whole bunch, so it gets an automatic 10 for me, just from having been completely fitting my mood all week.
4807980	4808240	Alright.
4808260	4809401	It's been a de-stressing song.
4809881	4810261	Okay.
4810521	4810921	Fair enough.
4810961	4811221	Loki.
4812742	4813082	God.
4814302	4816763	This sounds like a sex scene, that's all it sounds like.
4818063	4819724	I've heard this song so many times.
4821244	4821765	It's good.
4821785	4823685	I think it's an 8.
4825806	4826006	Angel.
4826574	4829855	It's Delirium, so I would probably give it a 9.
4832015	4851320	Me, personally, about two years ago I would have given that song a 10, but I've played the fuck out of it since then, so I would give it an 8, but then I remembered that Delirium's kind of popular again in the Bomani scene because of After All being an Ultramix 2, so that's a good chance for those that haven't heard that song before to kind of hear a little bit else of Delirium, so I give it a 9 overall.
4852540	4852820	Alright.
4854252	4857874	Let's see, song number three tonight comes to you courtesy of Loki.
4858254	4864456	Remember, if you don't agree with our votes, which apparently in the chat room a lot of you guys disagree with the way we felt about song number one, and you can blow me.
4866337	4868678	But remember, it does come down to your vote in the chat room.
4868778	4872580	So we'll be voting as soon as this song's done that comes to you via Loki.
4872620	4873620	And what song are we going to hear?
4875121	4878202	Well, if you grew up in the 80s, then you already know what this song is.
4878482	4882644	And if you've watched, you know, The Breakfast Club, then you already know what this song is.
4883635	4891280	This is the Simple Minds with Don't You Forget About Me, and it's not sung horribly, like myself, or the singer in Karaoke Revolution.
4892680	4894702	What's up with you guys and old school songs tonight?
4895422	4896583	Alright, fair enough.
4897003	4899665	Anything's game here in the Orange Lounge Cage Match, and this is it.
4899725	4901206	Simple Minds, Don't You Forget About Me.
4901286	4901526	Enjoy.
4946696	4949318	Won't you come see about me?
4949459	4971118	I'll be alone, dancing, you know it, baby Tell me your troubles and doubts Giving me everything, inside and out and Love's strange, surreal and bizarre Think of the tender things that we were working on
4972479	4988488	No change may pull us apart When the light gets into your heart, baby Don't you forget about me Don't, don't, don't, don't Don't you forget about me
5000335	5001436	Thank you for watching!
5026790	5027772	Thanks for watching!
5050482	5052264	Thank you for watching!
5084979	5097864	Don't you forget about me Don't, don't, don't, don't Don't you forget about me Will you stand above me Look my way, will you ever love me Rain keeps falling
5114352	5115633	Thank you for watching!
5171228	5183261	Don't you forget about me Don't, don't, don't, don't Don't you forget about me But you won't come by Where you call my name
5226302	5228408	I won't call my name Will you call my name
5265885	5267214	Thanks for watching!
5295825	5299726	Alright, song number three in tonight's Cage Match, Simple Minds, Don't You Forget About Me.
5299886	5300346	Jamie?
5301226	5302587	I love the song to bits.
5304267	5306388	So much, and I'm so glad it's not a crappy remix.
5307688	5312949	So, uh, there are 80 songs that I like better, but I really like that one a whole lot, so it gets a nine.
5314110	5314870	Alright, Loki?
5317531	5319391	I like that song, so it gets a ten.
5320791	5322452	Because, I don't know...
5325049	5333452	I don't know why, I just, I like that song a lot, and it just reminds me of every, you know, John Hughes film when I see that, you know, or listen to that song.
5333472	5335933	I don't know.
5335953	5339554	I wish they'd play it more on the 80s station that we have locally instead of the Reflex.
5339594	5341735	They play the Reflex goddamn 50 times a day.
5344456	5347657	I just remembered, I was gonna do a Duran Duran song tonight, and I totally forgot.
5347757	5348317	Alright, anyway.
5349437	5349778	Angel!
5350718	5352779	Uh, it's 80s, so you know what that means.
5352799	5353439	I'll give it a 10.
5355499	5358320	Me personally, I love that song a lot.
5358480	5361141	I just would have loved it at DDR length a lot more.
5361361	5365263	That song went on forever, so I give it a 6 for the number of minutes it was.
5369104	5379068	Alright, let's review the songs you can vote for tonight, starting off with song number 1, which is a song called Bitch by J-Punch.
5389229	5416523	and song number two that you can vote for tonight is Delirium featuring Sarah McLachlan with Silence and song number three you can vote for tonight Simple Minds, Don't You Forget About Me
5426906	5429888	Place vote now.
5429948	5434390	Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.
5434911	5437072	And we'll tally them up and see who the winner is.
5438041	5442089	Alright, meanwhile, some stuff's going on here locally in town.
5442129	5446157	We just, um, we found out something going on at one of our local arcades.
5446197	5448341	We've talked about it a little bit on this show, Arvigil.
5449637	5450237	RVGL.
5451417	5455378	And this new rumor has come up, although you can't really call it a rumor.
5455418	5460279	I would say it's in that stage where it hasn't happened yet, but it's a lot more solid than a rumor.
5460739	5464000	So it's kind of a... It's a congealed mass.
5464140	5464860	Yeah, basically.
5464900	5472181	I don't know what you would call it when it's not really a rumor because there's lots of facts backing it up, but it hasn't happened yet either, so it's an almost stage.
5472481	5475742	But that is that Rosal Goughlin's going to get a 2DX machine, basically.
5476282	5476762	Woo-hoo!
5478076	5479933	What I think is most exciting about this
5480976	5484298	is the fact that I think this is going to bring people back to RVGL.
5484318	5489000	Because let's face it, it's winter time now, so there's not as many stupid theme park kids hanging around there.
5490461	5494423	And honestly, we've been kind of missing something like this for a while.
5494443	5494863	You know what I mean?
5494883	5501547	Remember when we used to have those Wednesday nights over at Golfland, and we'd all go, and man, what was new in those days?
5501627	5503948	That wasn't extreme, was still kind of the... We had Fourth Mix.
5504308	5504889	No, no, no.
5505449	5507090	Our big meeting days was back in the day.
5507110	5507910	Max and Max 2 were the best.
5507930	5508210	That was it.
5508230	5509351	We were trying to unlock stuff.
5512539	5518681	Yeah, I remember that, because everybody was trying to unlock stuff in Max 2, and I kept trying to get AAAs on songs.
5518841	5524884	I would just play sets of basic songs to try and get AAAs, because that was 10 points off if you could get a AAA.
5524924	5525344	Remember that?
5525484	5525904	That was fun.
5526284	5527865	And then we'd all go to Brookfields afterwards.
5528465	5537569	I'm sure somewhere in your town, I know we're national, in some cases international broadcasts, I know maybe in your neck of the woods you guys do something similar, but we haven't been doing this for about a year and a half when...
5538129	5539170	And how long do we freaking tell them?
5539210	5539550	Seriously.
5539570	5540772	I give it... One week.
5561551	5562151	and it's inoperable.
5562171	5562672	Sorry, broken.
5563172	5564072	One weekend's broken.
5564213	5568115	I will take a step further and say that the DVD drive goes out.
5569916	5570676	One weekend's broken.
5570756	5578340	They're buying a new monitor for it because I guess the monitor that was on it was fucked and... That was probably like the old sugar monitor, huh?
5578980	5579201	Yes.
5580821	5585084	So, um... I give it a week before the little kids fuck it up.
5585684	5589166	I still think it's gonna be the DVD drive that goes out or someone's gonna spill something on the panel.
5590207	5590847	It's going to be shit.
5591188	5596250	And I'm afraid it's going to make people even more pissed off because it's just another game that they're not going to fix up.
5598131	5599171	But hey, whatever.
5599671	5601032	Whatever makes you happy, I guess.
5601272	5603373	Whatever sinks your battleship.
5607655	5610956	I totally agree with the fact that some little kid is probably going to spill something on it.
5610996	5614157	I just hope they put the machine in a place where somebody can watch it.
5615058	5615378	I don't know.
5616969	5619591	What can they do to help 2DX not die?
5619711	5622313	What do you guys think they could do?
5623694	5629559	Have a guard posted there 24-7 and have a height bar for you to be able to go up to the machine.
5629819	5631620	That guard will be you, Jamie.
5632861	5633822	They'll pay me, okay.
5639006	5639386	Alright.
5640287	5642048	I'm tallying up the votes for the cage match right now.
5642088	5646612	What else do you think would be something fun that we could do to kind of get the crowds going at Golf Land again?
5649639	5652020	How about they fix my fucking machine that I built them?
5652040	5655841	They spent all my hard time on and then went to shit really quick.
5655961	5656581	How about that?
5657742	5658502	That might be nice.
5660423	5662323	Seriously, I don't know why I even try anymore.
5662343	5663764	You know, why do I try?
5663784	5664944	Because it just goes to shit.
5666405	5666785	Fuck them.
5667225	5667785	That's what I say.
5667885	5668245	Fuck them.
5668625	5670526	You know, I'm going to make my own machine.
5671086	5672307	I'll fucking make my own arcade.
5672607	5673387	That's the way it'll be.
5674507	5676228	But, you know, I'm just tired of it.
5677048	5679069	Tired of spending my time there trying to fix shit.
5679554	5679974	Hey, they have Doc!
5709233	5709914	and Derby on Earth.
5711436	5712977	I need to go race Gungoro again.
5713718	5717001	Part of me kind of wants to go to Arvigil tomorrow to see if they got the machine up and running.
5717262	5728614	I just, another fact that makes me very happy that Arvigil's getting 2DX is that I really don't like going to Svigil to play and I apologize if you're a Svigil regular but there's a lot of you guys that hang out there that are kind of dicks.
5729375	5738804	I'm sorry, but I just feel this very thick dickiness when I walk into Spiggle.
5738864	5745431	It's like, if you can't pass eight stars, then you suck and you shouldn't even deserve to play here.
5745451	5750676	And they don't tell people when they get new machines and stuff because they don't want scary newbies around and stuff.
5750696	5752718	And I just don't like that attitude, you know what I mean?
5753258	5762744	and I'm sorry, because I have friends that play Svigal, you know, I'm not saying this is a, every single person is like this, but I just feel this aura of shittiness when I walk in there, and I'm sorry.
5763044	5769328	So that makes me very happy that Arvigil is going to be getting a machine, because I think a lot of people, even though Arvigil is kind of a...
5771535	5772156	How do you put it?
5772456	5775558	It's a dump in pretty rapping, basically.
5777440	5779261	The people there really are pretty good.
5779661	5785446	And I sense a lot of friendly people and, you know, I think more of a, you know, just try your best type attitude.
5785486	5786507	At least that's how I feel.
5786567	5786867	I don't know.
5786907	5787628	You feel that, Jamie?
5788108	5788688	Or is it just me?
5790570	5791370	I'm sorry, she's watching.
5791651	5792171	What about you, Loki?
5792191	5795794	Have you been to play at Spiegel?
5796454	5797195	A few times.
5798032	5799433	It's too cramped for my taste.
5799953	5802275	They have way too many machines and a way too small arcade.
5802295	5804857	That's the only thing I got from it.
5806418	5807498	But, I don't know.
5807899	5808859	They have In The Groove now.
5810521	5813102	I guess that's not, I don't know.
5814283	5816865	I wouldn't want to play In The Groove, but you know, that's just me.
5819181	5828346	But you know, honestly, I would rather them put in the groove in that cabinet that's broken right now than, you know, have it be just not working at all.
5828826	5833128	You know, I'd rather have that cabinet being used for something other than just to sit there broken.
5835429	5841752	And if that's what they gotta do, then go ahead, buy the machine, put it in there, so then we can upgrade it to mine with working parts.
5844694	5847815	And again, I don't want to bash on everybody that goes to Sviggle.
5847835	5849576	I'm not trying to start any drama or anything.
5849596	5853838	It's just I've had one too many kind of shitty experiences when I was there.
5853958	5855839	So I'm sure there's a lot of great people.
5855859	5857579	In fact, I know there's a lot of great people that play Sviggle.
5857619	5860521	It's just that there's a lot of attitude that comes along with Sviggle.
5860541	5861501	So I don't know.
5861801	5865963	As far as In the Groove goes, you know, I talked about the game before on the show.
5866003	5868304	I got to play it, and it's okay.
5868344	5869364	There's things I like about it.
5869384	5870385	There's things I don't like about it.
5870765	5872706	I would rather see In the Groove than nothing.
5872746	5873987	I mean, it's a nice little addition.
5874027	5875547	It's something I would play once in a while.
5875887	5877788	It's not something I'm going to go gaga over.
5878008	5881290	It is not a replacement for DDR, I don't think.
5882130	5884251	But it's something to kind of pass the time.
5884951	5887473	And again, the one thing that always kind of bugged me about...
5888713	5895819	Excuse me, the one thing that always kind of bugs me about In The Groove is that In The Groove is not DDR unless it's convenient for it to be DDR.
5895899	5896400	You know what I mean?
5896840	5900123	Like, when it's convenient to say it's the new DDR, then it's the new DDR.
5900163	5904086	But when, you know, it's being bashed on, then oh well, you can't say that because it's not DDR.
5904367	5905748	It's kind of like, you know, make up your mind.
5905788	5906528	Is it DDR or not?
5907089	5908490	So, we'll see.
5909531	5914075	Anyway, Jamie, did you have any thoughts on...
5915582	5918403	Um, I'm sorry, I had to take care of some business.
5918703	5919123	That's alright.
5919743	5921244	About, in the groove?
5922144	5926305	Uh, anything, either in the groove or Svigel versus, you know, other places.
5926325	5929926	You know, I, Svigel's like... It's not necessarily our Vigel, specifically, just Svigel in general.
5929946	5937008	No offense to the Sviglers, but walking into that place is like walking into, you know, a garage that somebody's put too much crap in.
5938449	5938569	It's...
5940385	5942165	Just not comfortable there.
5943026	5950827	I'd rather go to Miggle, where there's tons of room, generally nicer, more attentive people, than go waste my time at SVGL.
5951827	5953628	No offense to any of my friends that go there.
5957309	5957989	That's how I feel.
5959649	5959969	Alright.
5960189	5961009	Well, that's what we think.
5961049	5964090	If you disagree, you're welcome to join the chat or call us on the Skype line a little later.
5964770	5968091	Anyway, meanwhile, you guys want to figure out who won the cage match?
5969502	5975785	All right, we're going to go to Cage Match, and the winner is... This is a very unique situation.
5977366	5982148	Tonight, in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, we had a three-way tie.
5982408	5983248	No way!
5983428	5988671	Three-way tie, and a lot of people voted tonight, and it's still a three-way tie.
5989311	5990232	Here's the weird thing.
5991112	5997575	Typically in a three-way tie, then the song that got thrown out, whoever put that song in, gets to vote on the winner.
5998407	6003129	But the problem is, there is no song being thrown out this week because there are three brand new songs.
6003869	6014874	So we have to go to Plan B. And basically what happens in Plan B, and I think this has only ever happened one time in show history, is that everybody else in the room who isn't a host gets to vote on the song that wins.
6015404	6016385	But we only have one person.
6016465	6018846	Which means there's only one other person here in the room tonight.
6019506	6022788	That means Angel is going to break the tie, so I gave her a little piece of paper.
6023328	6028330	She's going to write down on there her favorite song to win tonight's cage match.
6028431	6029011	No pressure.
6032813	6034914	But she's thinking about her vote.
6040497	6040957	That's right.
6047250	6048291	She's walking to her pen.
6049612	6051273	She's writing it down on the piece of paper.
6054275	6054636	All right.
6055817	6056277	You just got it?
6056337	6056637	Okay.
6057378	6059059	I have the vote in my hand.
6059119	6064103	Remember, once the votes are tallied, the other two songs have to leave.
6066044	6066885	I will now read the vote.
6070526	6077047	The winning song of tonight's cage match as decided on by DDR Angel.
6077548	6080848	Is there any particular, oh I have to ask you first, is there any particular reason you voted for this song?
6082009	6082209	No.
6086930	6087250	Alright.
6090010	6091171	Let's see, should I walk over to the cam?
6091531	6091751	Sure.
6092031	6092311	Alright.
6094511	6096552	This is a big moment in Orange Lounge Radio history.
6103902	6104522	Let's see, here we go.
6107304	6117790	And the winning song for tonight is song number one.
6118531	6119731	Song number one.
6122373	6125835	So that means by a three-way tiebreaker,
6126636	6128357	See, now everyone's dying in the chatroom.
6128377	6129038	What have I done?
6129058	6135823	Bitch wins the cage match, which is ironic because it's the song that got dogged on the most by the chatroom.
6138925	6140306	Hold on, I gotta play the victory lap here.
6145890	6146991	Bitch wins tonight's cage match.
6147011	6148392	Any particular reason you picked that one?
6148652	6152595	You gave that one the lowest score out of the three, so I'm kind of surprised that you voted for that one.
6152615	6155678	Well, I kind of thought of it, and, well, I don't know, I kind of like it.
6155718	6156038	It's kind of...
6157314	6161581	Well, it's more, I guess you could call it a club song, I don't know.
6163383	6164886	Most dancey out of the three, I guess.
6165492	6170055	That actually makes me happy because the chatroom was so, like, anti that song.
6170075	6171196	See, they don't like it too bad.
6172517	6174319	You guys voted for it in a three-way tie.
6174379	6177221	If any one of you had voted differently, it would have been different.
6177301	6177741	I'm kidding.
6177781	6178502	I love you, chatroom.
6178622	6179503	Alright, there you have it.
6180483	6183285	Alright, so Bitch will be back next week with two new songs.
6183646	6184286	That was good, though.
6184306	6185787	We don't get three-way ties very often.
6186288	6190611	But it was an exact, it was a multiple of three votes, and every one had the same amount.
6190631	6190851	It's crazy.
6190871	6193353	Wasn't this one, like, the second time it's happened or something?
6193733	6195014	I think it's only like the second time it's happened.
6195035	6195295	Yeah.
6195335	6195515	Ever.
6196776	6197056	Alright.
6197297	6198338	I feel special now.
6198578	6198998	Yay!
6200600	6200920	Alright.
6200980	6204003	We can thank Diebold Voting Machines for bringing us that result.
6204464	6206466	Just kidding.
6208007	6213132	Alright, we're gonna go to a break and in this break we're gonna hear, I don't know, what kind of music should we hear this break?
6214493	6215334	Any requests, Jamie?
6215454	6216015	Anything you want to hear?
6218422	6229428	Um, very, very, the first ever versions of songs that have been remixed to the point of making people physically ill.
6229908	6231069	Like, Paranoia.
6231089	6233230	Wow, okay.
6233730	6237052	Wow, that is a crazy theme, okay, but we can do that.
6237092	6237212	Max 300.
6238032	6238292	Okay.
6238492	6239273	Pre-remix.
6239433	6239713	Alright.
6240854	6245536	And, and actually just for the hell of it, because I hadn't heard it in forever, Dropout.
6247150	6249411	Even though that has nothing to do with... Even though.
6249611	6249871	All right.
6249911	6251131	Because I can't think of any others.
6251171	6252951	My God, I don't think I have the original Paranoia.
6252971	6254192	It's not in the Potpourri directory.
6254232	6254772	Okay, okay.
6254792	6255632	I'll tell you what.
6255752	6256232	Trip Machine.
6256932	6257492	Want Trip Machine?
6258273	6258313	No.
6258333	6258913	Do I have Trip Machine?
6258953	6259633	I don't like Trip Machine.
6259693	6259973	All right.
6260613	6261453	We'll do the next 300.
6261653	6262173	No, that's it.
6264454	6266895	Throw in QQQ.
6267995	6268495	QQQ.
6268695	6269275	For no good reason.
6269295	6269795	Thank you.
6270295	6270995	For no good reason.
6271035	6271756	For no good reason.
6272256	6273036	It's Taku.
6275362	6276905	I will say thank you for that.
6277266	6278128	Ha ha pun.
6279290	6279691	Shoot me.
6281154	6283439	We'll be right back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.
6337824	6338468	Thanks for watching!
6540745	6540987	and more.
6592032	6596356	Orange Lounge Radio is proud to present a celebrity interview.
6597216	6598858	Can you introduce yourself for our listeners?
6599318	6600159	I'm Miss Cleo.
6600699	6602280	Oh, it's great to have you on the show today.
6602621	6603782	Hello, how are you today?
6604262	6605223	I'm great, thanks.
6605403	6606424	Did you have a question?
6606844	6612749	Well, yes, actually I wanted to know... Can I please have your first name only and your birth date, please?
6613850	6613930	Uh...
6614813	6618455	Well, no, I actually just wanted to know what you thought of Orange Lounge Radio.
6618735	6619595	Alright, go ahead.
6619976	6623137	Well, what do you think of Loki, one of the three hosts of Orange Lounge Radio?
6623497	6624398	Is he incarcerated?
6625058	6628680	Uh, actually, no, he's not, but what do you think of the ever-ranty Dark Sakura?
6628820	6630101	Hi, dear, how are you?
6630681	6631421	I love you.
6631641	6633142	I see you two must know each other.
6633262	6634543	Well, what do you think of Skye?
6634863	6636784	Did he used to play football when he was in high school?
6637044	6638485	Well, actually, no, he didn't.
6638545	6638725	Haha!
6639696	6641557	Well, what do you think of Intern Zero?
6641997	6645380	I want you to really remember the pill, all right?
6645860	6651083	I'm seeing some forgetting, possibly, and I'm seeing a new baby in the next three months.
6651824	6652224	Right.
6652524	6655446	Okay, well, thanks for being on Orange Lounge Radio today.
6655586	6664211	I don't mean to sidetrack your question here, but who are all of these nosy people, outside influences I'm seeing around you by the moon card?
6664391	6665292	Get away from me.
6667842	6672663	Orange Lounge Radio, helping to free your mind and spirit.
6673123	6673963	I'm Miss Cleo.
6674324	6675064	I love you.
6679405	6682405	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
6683366	6685546	Episode number 122 in progress.
6686406	6688407	I can't believe we've been doing this crap this long.
6688427	6689147	Can you believe that?
6690587	6692308	I like your shirt there, Angel, that you're wearing.
6692328	6696009	The old classic Nintendo controller there with the Know Your Roots.
6696029	6697329	I've seen that for sale before.
6698163	6706693	Yeah, it's been around, but, you know, I mean... You always wear some kind of 8-bit shirt when you come over here, I notice.
6706793	6708475	I just, I kind of notice this trend.
6708515	6711799	You have your, uh, are you the one with the Mega Man shirt?
6711839	6713801	Or you have the Piranha Plant that says, Bite Me?
6714061	6715743	I have the Piranha Plant that says, Bite Me.
6715823	6717866	I have the, uh...
6719132	6721333	I got Mad Bills, which is the Bullet Bill one.
6721753	6728975	It's got all the different ones on it.
6729135	6732476	The only one I have is the Goomba one that says you lose.
6732516	6736277	I actually wore that to the Live 365 Awards, so that was kind of an omen that year.
6737817	6747300	Yep, and the same day that I had picked up the Bite Me shirt, I washed it and wore it over here.
6748072	6749393	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6781964	6783665	I'll just have to take your word for it, I suppose.
6783825	6786186	I believe it's Arden, actually, now that I think about it.
6786386	6787187	Alright, fair enough.
6787767	6789228	Alright, let's see.
6789768	6792569	We're going to go on over to Loki, if you don't mind.
6793270	6797772	And I was curious what's going on in the sim scene right now, besides the dancing characters, of course.
6797812	6799313	Is there any other news going on out there right now?
6800734	6804015	Besides numerous websites being down, not really, no.
6804836	6804916	Uh...
6806758	6808820	No, really, actually, nothing's going on at all.
6809340	6811322	I couldn't really tell you any updates on Step Mini.
6811342	6816387	I don't think there have been any new releases of it since Release Candidate 2, if I remember correctly.
6818589	6830940	I know that they're still hard at work over on DDRUK on getting those sim files out for... Was it a Dancing Stage Fusion and... Let's see...
6832168	6860324	DDR Festival and Ultramix 2 those are almost done I think Festival is close to being done they're waiting on graphics and Ultramix 2 they're still working on and I would assume by now that Fusion's done because that game's been out forever now I think they're just going to be doing like one update where they have them all up online but still nothing yet on those but should be soon hopefully
6861400	6884977	and then, um, really other than that, I don't think there's anything else going on, sort of sim-related, um, Funmix Plus, um, it was just announced, actually, that they're going to be releasing, of course, exclusively in Japan, um, a soundtrack for Funmix Plus and Funmix, I guess, it's going to be out there, there's a little demo on the Funmix site, I don't remember the URL by it,
6885498	6891846	OffChance right now, but that's going to be coming out eventually with all extended tracks and stuff from your favorite Foon Mix artists.
6893268	6897654	And really other than that, not much going on right now.
6898234	6898655	Pretty quiet.
6899707	6901548	That Foon Mix soundtrack sounds pretty exciting, though.
6901568	6902568	I'd be looking forward to that.
6902608	6904168	Foon Mix is some good stuff.
6904328	6913771	And I wouldn't even call them Bomani remixes, because they're almost these completely different songs that are just kind of inspired by familiar Bomani tunes.
6914151	6917172	Not just those, but their original stuff is freaking great, too.
6917252	6919593	So hats off to those guys for putting a soundtrack together.
6920445	6949741	and as I mentioned probably last week and the week before last and so on and so forth um there's the brand new um Diverse Systems album that's coming out called and this was as you may remember Dear Mr. 180 well now we have Dear Mr. Desire which is all remixes which is ironically enough it's remixes of Revenge and Desire songs so um get all your Trip Machine, Cigaru and Healing Vision uh remixes out there um they're all uh on this one um
6950441	6959468	CD from Diverse Systems, and also the Food Mix CD should be available through Silly Walker, which is another Diverse Systems-like site.
6960029	6969736	Fortunately, all these sites being located in Japan, they're only selling exclusively in Japan, so it's really hard to get a hold of this stuff, especially if you don't speak Japanese.
6971077	6974360	It's pretty hard to find it, but it's out there, so you know.
6976311	6989809	I know that Diverse Systems is re-updating their entire English page, so I'm sure that D7 along with this brand new album should be up there eventually as soon as they get done with that, probably next year.
6992620	6994121	Alright, good times.
6996803	6998564	Moving right along, excuse me.
6998624	7017757	You know, going back to a topic that we had going on earlier in this show, John, you know John in our chat room, he actually went to the OC Remix and got one of them to come over here to try and talk you into, I don't know if they're here to talk you into it or what, but answer any questions you may have about the OC Remix policy.
7018057	7020159	You know what, Loki, I think you're just going to have to do it.
7021644	7022305	I don't care.
7022425	7025887	I just don't think it's, you know, usually... You think you're not worthy.
7025967	7026508	Is that what it is?
7027349	7027849	I guess.
7028029	7030491	You've got all these listeners telling you you're worthy.
7030591	7031152	Just do it.
7031552	7031952	Do it!
7031992	7032392	Do it, Loki!
7032413	7032813	Do it!
7032853	7033393	Do it!
7033433	7034194	Do it!
7034274	7034934	Do it!
7035955	7036516	I guess.
7037156	7038297	That's the spirit.
7038317	7039278	Yay!
7040759	7041019	Alright.
7041860	7043281	So you guys can be looking forward to that.
7045042	7048465	I think it would be funny if we went through all that and then they say, oh, sorry, this sucks.
7050447	7050807	I'd laugh.
7051124	7054566	Hey, it'll give us good material for next week's show, so I'm down for it.
7056668	7057909	Good luck to you, Loki.
7057929	7058749	I hope it works out for you.
7058769	7059390	I think that'll be fun.
7060170	7060470	All right.
7062312	7064473	Oh, John's going all the way to the top.
7064613	7065014	Look at that.
7066394	7067355	That guy's crazy.
7067675	7068916	That guy's your biggest fan.
7069417	7069977	Look at that.
7070857	7071658	Loki's turning red.
7072078	7073499	I better change the subject.
7076161	7076641	Yes, Loki.
7078142	7080104	We gotta get to actual news now.
7081710	7084591	So we do all this fun stuff and then get back to some actual news.
7085331	7089732	The full unlock list for 2DX Red has been released, actually.
7091212	7095113	With some interesting information here, we've got all the hidden songs.
7095373	7110196	So we have, you know, Egea by Ryu, Blox by Sparker, The Hope of Tomorrow by Sota, Earthscape by DJ Taka, Ultimate by Terra, Fake Time by DJ Rimocon,
7111190	7118234	and Close My Eyes For Me by D.Crew featuring Dennis Gunn.
7120935	7123596	That's two letters off from being the name of my boss.
7124577	7126578	Seriously, that's scaring to me.
7126658	7127078	Alright, sorry.
7128619	7134262	Anyways, and also with Hidden and Others for Double A, Andromeda, and Gigadelic.
7135928	7148581	I told Navi, and if you're out there listening, Navi, you poppin' music whore friend of mine and 2DX whore part-time, I told you when you said that there were not a whole lot of anothers in 2DX Red, I said, they're probably hidden.
7149041	7151003	I told you so, I told you so, I told you so.
7151324	7151584	Thank you.
7153368	7162841	Anyways, also should mention, since it's sort of Bomani related, exclusively through BomaniStyle.com, they're going to be releasing Slake's new album.
7163602	7168589	And Slake, for those of you who might not know, is an old school Bomani artist.
7170157	7185441	Some of the titles for these songs here, Past, Oriental, Mechanist, The Fading of Light, Justified, Rush, I Am a Clone, and looks like Astro... I can't even pronounce that.
7185741	7187182	Astro-Oxy Remix.
7188522	7190363	Anyways, and those should be coming soon.
7190383	7195424	They're doing some stupid little contests here where you get to design the cover and yadda yadda yadda.
7195544	7197625	So go to my cell, check it out.
7200236	7202406	Here's a little clip of Slake, if you're unfamiliar with Slake.
7202426	7204796	Here's a little clip of cloudy music from 7thstyle.
7219472	7222673	So I don't know what exactly you would call Slake's style of music.
7222713	7227434	It's just, it's funky beats, I think would be a good way of putting, classifying Slake.
7227454	7228634	You can't really classify him.
7228674	7231055	He's a pretty fun guy.
7233196	7236137	Yeah, so, I don't know.
7236357	7236737	But anyways.
7238777	7241019	Huh, so I think that's pretty much all the news.
7241119	7243321	Oh, Poppin's 12, something happened with that.
7243541	7243862	I don't know.
7243882	7247265	I have a little piece of news I want to share going on.
7247405	7252950	Actually, this was posted to our site by our very own news guy, Dark Tetsuya, who does a lot of the news for the site.
7252970	7255452	We really appreciate him helping out over at OrangeLaundry.com.
7255872	7264060	I don't know if you guys remember this, but way back in the beginnings of the show, I'm talking like two years ago, back in the first like 10, 20 episodes, you guys remember Twin Galaxies?
7265569	7268010	Yeah, I noticed that that's back.
7268170	7274192	Yeah, Twin Galaxies, now they are the site that does all the high scores for games, video games.
7274232	7277673	I'm not talking about just like new video games, I'm talking about old video games too.
7277714	7282875	We actually, probably the last time we brought them up on the show was during Classic Gaming Expo earlier this year.
7282955	7286437	Remember when we all participated in the Stampede Challenge?
7286697	7290558	Which, by the way, I never checked to see if the scores were on, because I, are they?
7291138	7292139	They were, and you did.
7292219	7292439	Check.
7292899	7294619	Oh, okay, I don't remember.
7295680	7299260	I'm going to have to pull that up again, because I remember that I was in the bottom three.
7299300	7301661	I swear I did so horrible at Stampede.
7301841	7306542	I was somewhere in the teens for the rankings for Gradius V also.
7307462	7308202	Very, very nice.
7308422	7313823	How does that make your internet penis feel, to be in the top 20 Gradius V players, officially?
7314063	7316804	That's pretty sad, since I don't play Gradius.
7317084	7321105	That was the first time I'd ever played Gradius V. That's not saying much.
7326583	7328186	Twin Galaxies is back in the news.
7328406	7331913	Apparently, a brand new record has been set.
7333703	7348369	And I'm actually going to the link, which is a link actually to a post over on AaronInJapan.com And they actually, and if you want to see all this for yourself, it's all posted over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com They actually posted a story from Twin Galaxies, where apparently, what is the guy's name?
7348729	7352090	Gregory Cantor of Pennsylvania in the U.S.
7352130	7353411	Hey, that's where I spent some time this year.
7354872	7358454	You know, funny enough, I didn't see any good DDR machines while I was out there.
7358534	7362317	Apparently, I was checking all the wrong places, so it was my own damn fault.
7362537	7368942	This guy in Pennsylvania has just set the new record for DDR Extreme.
7369993	7374495	And basically the way the rules work, this is the way the official rules work for you to get ranked.
7374856	7377037	You have to be playing on easy, difficulty 3.
7377797	7379058	It's a 5 song set.
7379578	7381159	Game over has to be turned on.
7381779	7384921	You get to play your choice of songs, but you have to be on heavy mode.
7385281	7389423	The gamer is allowed to take as much time in between sets as the timer allows.
7389943	7393445	No song can be picked more than 2 times in the performance.
7393925	7396266	The selection and sequence of songs is the player's choice.
7396726	7399166	Player's hands may not touch the dance pad.
7399606	7400406	Bar's okay though.
7400827	7402787	Only the player's feet may touch the dance pad.
7402807	7403887	So this is how the guy did it.
7404187	7410849	He played Max 300, Max Unlimited, Sakura, Bag, Paranoia Rebirth.
7410909	7412929	So basically he played every 10-footer in the game.
7413269	7413809	Is Rebirth a 10?
7414230	7414710	Or is Rebirth a 9?
7415490	7417450	So he played... Are you sure?
7418490	7420351	Alright, so he played four 10s and a 9.
7422409	7429639	And he ended up with a, what would they, actually, if you read on in the thread, they don't think it's Suguru, they think it's actually Sakura, not Suguru.
7429840	7432604	Which would make more sense anyway, for somebody to pick Sakura, because it's a 10.
7433084	7434526	So this guy got a score of 375,311,150 points.
7437711	7437791	YASU
7453388	7464277	If I'm not mistaking, didn't he, remember when we first brought this up on the show, it was some other guy who had a really, really low record, we were all making fun of how we were going to beat it, and then Yasu came in and kicked all our asses, basically.
7464718	7466079	So that's why this is such big news.
7466359	7472084	If, if, I recall, and I may be wrong, but, because maybe it's a Max 2 versus Extreme thing, I don't know.
7472364	7473505	You know any more about this, Loki?
7474666	7479991	That was Max 2, if I remember correctly, and the rules were different than, I think, the rules where you can't play a song more than twice.
7481119	7482820	in a row, or twice, I think.
7483301	7486422	Because I think he played Max Unlimited twice or something like that.
7486582	7486883	I don't know.
7487403	7488083	It was stupid.
7488223	7489504	Twin Galaxies is stupid.
7489604	7490325	I really don't care.
7492186	7492946	That's my take on it.
7496568	7497309	Very interesting.
7499901	7505484	And now I'm getting a message in our chatroom over at www.orangelandredo.com from Dark Tetsuya.
7506044	7510626	Oh, sorry guys, it was Take, not Yasu, that set the bar there, sorry.
7511126	7511667	You know what?
7512347	7518370	Both of them are insanely good at DDR, it's easy to get them confused because you always hear about them together.
7518410	7520131	You always hear about the two of them, so sorry about that.
7520331	7521071	My bad, my bad.
7522472	7527014	But Dark Tetsuya says, it seems like he may not have gotten parental permission.
7528667	7531789	I certainly didn't have parental permission when I played Stampede.
7534290	7535991	My mother doesn't know I do this garbage.
7536111	7536472	I don't know.
7536832	7540053	You have to have parental permission to be on a high score list?
7540133	7542034	Is that what they're trying to say?
7542195	7543915	Something about child privacy law.
7544836	7545436	Jeez.
7548038	7548698	That's kind of lame.
7549458	7550579	I'm sorry, but I think that's lame.
7552475	7553756	Alright, we're going to go to our break, guys.
7553776	7556557	So when we come back from this break, we're going to get into the FUs of the week.
7557177	7561039	Because we have to do that segment every week because we're just angsty.
7561059	7562139	We're angsty, angsty people.
7562620	7563440	And we have to get it out.
7564040	7567142	In this break, we're going to hear... I don't know.
7567162	7568502	What are you in the mood for, Jamie?
7568522	7570243	What do you want to hear this break?
7570863	7574325	How about Dance Maniac stuff?
7574685	7576346	Ooh, sounds like a plan to me.
7576446	7577547	Let's do some Dance Maniac songs.
7577567	7578707	Like Jay Paradise stuff.
7579367	7580548	If I can find some, we'll do that.
7583297	7583517	What?
7584877	7585157	Nothing.
7585577	7586198	Okay.
7586658	7588438	How about, okay, better yet.
7589438	7594499	I request... Hurry up.
7594559	7595139	Sensation.
7596339	7597419	Okay, if I can find it.
7597679	7599460	Okay.
7600640	7601100	Twinbee.
7602240	7602540	Okay.
7603560	7606161	And Gradius Full Speed.
7606841	7607961	Okay, we'll make that happen.
7608001	7612422	We'll be right back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.
7715539	7716902	Thanks for watching!
7748018	7749819	Thank you for watching!
7893667	7894648	Thanks for watching!
7918191	7926779	Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.
7926819	7932345	Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?
7933140	7936123	I saw the precious precious sitting back in the tech room today
7954261	7957707	It's a nice, pretty little 2DX machine missing the monitor because they're replacing it.
7958067	7961112	It's currently in 8th style, but who knows what it'll be when it's up and running.
7961493	7966801	I smooched it to tell it I love it, and yes, I humped it too, just like I did the Scandia 8th style when it first came in.
7966841	7967963	That's so good to know now.
7969963	7970503	So there it is.
7970883	7972684	It's got wifey poo humping on it.
7973404	7973784	Great.
7973844	7974385	That's happy.
7974425	7976545	Girl cooties on the 2DX machine.
7977526	7977946	Just kidding.
7978266	7979427	That makes it all the better.
7980987	7981927	So that's pretty exciting.
7981968	7982388	So there it is.
7982768	7985389	That's about as close to a confirmation as you can get.
7985469	7988530	When Iguana Girls humped it, you know it's the real deal.
7990111	7990411	Alright.
7992351	7996333	So anyway, moving right along, I guess we're going to get into the FUs of the week.
7997935	7999136	We're not going to take it anymore.
7999176	7999496	Oh, this is bad.
8031287	8032268	A big F.U.
8032308	8035851	toward my overwhelming lack of free time the past week.
8035911	8041436	However, now that this semester is over and I have one thing left to do, it's great.
8041456	8048883	But then I just realized that the classes that I need to take next semester are full term, except for one that's going to be second half.
8050117	8052982	So I'm going to be really freaking busy next semester.
8055005	8064039	F you to there being no time off allowed next month, but I might have to beg some anyway to take care of some school stuff.
8066992	8070854	Just an FU toward all the slow ass people on the road today.
8071295	8078759	Oh yeah, and an FU toward the guy who cut me off in traffic and then threw on his brakes on purpose.
8078779	8081301	Because he was tailgating me so I slowed down.
8081661	8086143	So he goes around me and then gets in front of me and tries to throw on his brakes so that I went into him.
8086524	8088885	Thing is, I drive a Tercel with bad brakes.
8089165	8089625	I was going 50.
8090646	8092706	You know, that would have been, like, lethal.
8093046	8098708	So, I, luckily there was no one in the next instance, so I swerved around him, and it turns out that I ended up being, like, five cars ahead of him in traffic anyway.
8099288	8102728	So, he got stuck behind, like, some old people in a Buick.
8104729	8113210	Um, F you toward, uh, not having money, time, and certain things.
8115651	8117511	Yeah, that's really about it.
8119764	8124787	I just want to point out for a minute, if any of the OC Remix people are listening, this is another one by Loki.
8130351	8131091	We're going to get you.
8131111	8134253	We're going to get you to whore yourself out.
8134293	8135854	If you won't do it, dammit, we will.
8138195	8139816	And on that note, let's go over to Loki.
8143459	8145420	Whatever, I don't even care anymore.
8146092	8148094	Fuck you to my work for making me bake cookies.
8148474	8151036	I don't like extracurricular activities no matter what they are.
8151316	8152457	Even if it involves cookies.
8152537	8154898	Because the cookies I made, I don't like to eat.
8155239	8156279	One, because they taste like lemon.
8156320	8158241	Two, because they have nuts in them.
8158441	8159462	It's not my forte.
8159722	8160022	Anyways.
8161243	8165326	Um, I guess fuck you, uh, CarMax for taking forever to fix my car.
8165426	8169149	I didn't know, but I guess it takes two days to do a fucking brake job.
8169789	8170990	Whoa, what have I been doing?
8171010	8174613	I must have been doing it completely wrong because I get mine done in like an hour and a half.
8175182	8179143	The only problem is I didn't know I needed a brake job, because I didn't know what the fuck was wrong with my brake.
8179524	8198570	Come to find out, it was actually something when the person before me, or CarMax, who fucking knows, installed my brakes, they installed them incorrectly, so the retainer clip was broken, and thus the pad was wearing funny, causing a vibration noise, thus resulting in my brake being worn down on one side, not the other side, so I needed the front brake job.
8199111	8199851	But, unfortunately...
8200219	8202480	I'll have to do a front break job later, because I got done now.
8202840	8203961	So, good for that.
8204761	8214546	Um, and then finally, um, since I don't really have that many FUs this week, um, fuck you to, uh, let's see here.
8215086	8220549	I know it's coming here, coming, coming, um, no, I can't think of what it was.
8221110	8225352	Um, there's something that was really pissing me off the other day, but I just cannot remember what it is right now.
8225672	8225792	Um,
8228075	8229516	All things just keep getting better
8256591	8259013	F you to the fog, because fog is scary.
8259393	8262116	And I don't like driving in the fog, because it's very scary.
8263297	8263497	Yes.
8263737	8266420	We saw a six-car accident in the fog yesterday.
8266440	8268222	See, the fog is scary.
8269122	8272866	Fog is a cruel trick to be playing on us humans, so I say F you to fog.
8273446	8275008	And F you to angst.
8278451	8286654	and F you to the fact that I wasn't drinking last night even though for once I was the person that didn't have to drive so I could have drank all I wanted but I didn't because I'm a pussy.
8287495	8293297	And F you to complicated situations because I keep finding myself in them and I hate that.
8295398	8296578	Fair enough?
8296639	8298879	I was going to add something on the fog thing.
8300040	8300240	What?
8300260	8304902	A dude in a Mustang broke through one of our neighbor's fences.
8306138	8308959	F-Fog Actually, I do have to say one thing about Fog, if I may
8331289	8338375	Um, when I lived in Alabama, in college, at our dorms there was like this little grove of trees and it would get so foggy they would play hide and seek in the fog.
8338996	8339536	That, oh.
8340097	8340777	That was really cool.
8340877	8343860	I would be so afraid of getting raped by a zombie in the fog.
8344901	8346883	This is the days before Silent Hill.
8347243	8347783	Still!
8348644	8351306	Zombie raping has been around forever.
8351907	8355190	Well, that would explain a few people who call where I work.
8355410	8355770	Alright.
8356851	8357592	Let's move on.
8357772	8358713	Angel, your FUs.
8359361	8365706	Um, yeah, I'll add another F you to the difficult situation thing, just because I hate that.
8366886	8373671	Um, F you to, um, yeah.
8373691	8377774	F you to a parent that wants to be there but never was to begin with.
8378275	8384819	I'm not talking about my parents, I'm talking about my significant other's certain parents.
8385700	8387221	Um, and, uh, you know what?
8387970	8391473	They don't want you there, so stop trying, because you never tried anyway.
8392473	8393934	And, uh, that's it.
8395275	8395576	Alright.
8396756	8399018	Let's go on to the chatroom FUs, then.
8400259	8404502	Dork says, F you to myself for having a girl over and not doing anything about it.
8406484	8406784	Yeah, exactly.
8406804	8407224	What, Loki?
8408225	8408865	Yeah, exactly.
8408905	8411207	That stuff will kick you until the day you die.
8411507	8411807	Okay?
8412048	8415070	Just, you gotta remember, do it even if it seems wrong.
8417520	8418501	Get the zombies to help.
8419122	8432680	Dark Knight says, My FU goes to the greedy American cable company, sounding like an English-speaking Japanese guy, for trying to make you spend more money by removing HBO and Cinemax from basic and just putting on digital cable only now.
8433441	8433642	Hmm.
8435931	8442900	EvilMauki2DX says, F you to DarkLionXVI for pointing out that Noria has crooked teeth and needs braces.
8443321	8445924	I'll never be able to look at her the same ever again.
8446345	8448107	I don't know how you didn't notice that before.
8448227	8448668	You're weird.
8449409	8452192	And one more F you to whatever caused the station drops earlier.
8452313	8452753	I agree.
8452833	8453214	Thank you.
8453374	8453835	That was evil.
8455267	8460828	DarkLionXVI says, F you to Nathan Gale for killing metal guitar legend Dimebag Daryl.
8461928	8462988	Double amen to that.
8463348	8465309	And four other fans in Columbus, Ohio.
8465669	8467669	I'm glad the police officer killed the bastard.
8467729	8468749	Nathan, I hope you're comfortable.
8468789	8469350	Stay in hell.
8469730	8471110	Rest in peace, Dimebag Daryl.
8471670	8474711	We in the metal world will miss your red goatee and intense guitar riffs.
8475391	8480932	Oh, and F you to EvilNauki2DX for torturing me with Nico Mimi Mode, the opening theme for...
8482745	8484647	You just had to do this to the white guy, didn't you?
8485067	8506685	Sukyomi Moonphase John Fields says, F you to the asshole who caused the pipe upstairs to burst My dorm room is flooded, oh you are sued, oh you are so sued You ruined my stuff and it's finals week F you to the school as well for not keeping the maintenance on the pipes in this dorm You're sued as well if there isn't any compensation coming to me
8509389	8515712	Illusion says, F you to waking up at 4.30 in the morning because of a nightmare of some weird guy strangling a woman with floss.
8517052	8519593	Oh well, it led to my new short story being written.
8520054	8523375	F you to this stupid character analysis paper for the Scarlet Letter due tomorrow.
8523655	8528277	And finally, a kind F you to DDR Angel for making that crappy bitch song win the cage match.
8528697	8530718	Sarah McLachlan was clearly the best song.
8531098	8532999	But it was a kind F you, DDR Angel.
8534560	8537261	I can't say anything because I don't know him, so whatever.
8537762	8540363	and besides, they left the decision up to me anyway.
8540383	8541523	That's right, you tell them.
8545285	8549847	Alright, Misty says, F the movie theater that is one of only two in the group of machines in St.
8549887	8552047	Louis for not having the machine on tonight.
8552128	8554228	I'd rather play on shitty pads than not at all.
8554729	8559010	Nice to see you finally give a damn about the machine's maintenance though and of course, F the cage match.
8559870	8560411	You're welcome.
8561631	8566353	Jaded2004 says, F you to a broken rib which equals no DDR for a month.
8568154	8573196	Sigurd says, F you to a certain friend and his brother for not coming to terms with each of their sexuality.
8573577	8575077	They can make such a hot porn.
8575137	8575498	Grr.
8576378	8578219	F you to not having WarioWare DS.
8578559	8580780	Played my friend's copy and it's the best game ever.
8581040	8582041	Wait, when did that come out?
8582101	8583561	WarioWare DS is not out.
8583701	8583962	What?
8584342	8587723	Um... Not that I know of.
8587883	8588764	Maybe in Japan?
8589224	8589624	Maybe.
8589664	8590845	Maybe in Japan.
8590885	8591865	Details, please.
8594006	8594887	It might be out in Japan.
8595782	8597723	Finally, F you to not getting enough sleep.
8597824	8599205	Damn you, Final Fantasy XI.
8599245	8600826	It's all your fault.
8602367	8603187	Alright, moving on.
8604348	8605109	What, DarkSakura?
8605729	8606530	I smell vanilla.
8607651	8609092	All of a sudden, I smell vanilla.
8610873	8614055	Blarg says F you to people who keep saying they're bored all the time.
8614115	8616237	It pisses off people who don't have time to do anything.
8616597	8620340	If you're bored, go read some books and stop telling everyone you have nothing to do.
8624728	8628313	Oh, they said in the chat room it's the Japanese version of WarioWare DS.
8628894	8629975	Just confirmation there.
8632358	8634461	And DarkTetsuya says, F you to my dance pad.
8634501	8638487	It might be broken, so I'm having a harder time passing Mission 19 on Extreme US.
8639147	8639288	Dope.
8640342	8643545	Legend of Zaku says, F you to having to go through the hell called finals week.
8643705	8647488	F you to lacking the basic skills of Java programming when I really need them.
8649049	8662761	And, uh, Rayum, I hope I said that, I hope, yeah, because if it was Ryum it would be an I, so Rayum says, F you to all the freaking extra hours that I have to put in before January 1st to compensate for the hours I put for my master's class.
8663241	8665283	Extra work hours, that means, sorry.
8666661	8668562	and Jazz says, F you to Saturday.
8668622	8670222	Holy crap, what a horrible day you were.
8670322	8676724	I had my first online final at 9 o'clock in the morning, so I got up early and went to school around 7 so I could get food and study.
8677065	8680306	During this process, I locked my keys in my car and need to call AAA.
8680666	8683567	I would have just called my parents, but they were conveniently in Reno for the weekend.
8683947	8689409	After that, I completely botched my final and proceeded to go home and drown my sorrows in sleep in World of Warcraft.
8690989	8692410	And after that, it got cut off, but...
8693427	8696049	If it has to do with World of Warcraft, I don't want to hear about it anyway.
8696629	8697950	I'm a little bitter towards that game.
8698210	8699051	I'm sure it's a great game.
8699091	8700052	I've heard a lot of good things about it.
8700072	8701253	I'm just a little bitter about it, that's all.
8703534	8704135	Anyway, that's it.
8704795	8706076	I'm looking at the Nevada girl.
8706657	8710359	And this is the link you had me post in the chat room earlier during the last podcast.
8710459	8717684	Yeah, there's an 11-year-old that killed a 12-year-old in her class in Japan, and now she's like an internet celebrity.
8719626	8721127	And they call her the Nevada girl.
8721327	8722348	I've heard of this girl.
8723055	8725117	or sometimes Tan-chan, I guess.
8725357	8726118	What happened to her?
8726758	8733104	Well, they can't really do anything to her because the age of criminal responsibility in Japan is 14, which actually was lowered from 16.
8734048	8736170	Wait, so when you kill somebody and you're 11?
8736350	8738992	If you're under 14, you can't be prosecuted.
8739012	8742075	But they're still trying to decide what to do with her.
8744977	8749781	But apparently she's a big internet celebrity now in Japan and there's all kinds of fan art about her.
8751943	8755786	I did post the links in my live journal including a bunch of the fan art.
8757047	8773221	This site, and if someone will just retype this for me, it's www.shrinemaden.com slash, and it's all in caps, Nevada underscore, and then capital A, the rest is lowercase, RTWORK.
8773862	8774783	I lost you, sorry.
8776827	8793474	www.shrinemaden.com, Nevada is all capitalized, underscore, Nevada, okay, underscore, and then artwork, capital A, the rest is lowercase.
8794354	8794854	That's the site.
8794914	8795694	That's it?
8795714	8796435	That's all the fan art.
8799316	8801517	There it is, in the chat room, just for you guys.
8806245	8808526	Some suggestions from the chatroom.
8808566	8810927	Dark Knight says, here's a suggestion, send her to her shrink.
8811947	8814107	Ram says the girl needs counseling big time.
8816068	8816508	There you go.
8818028	8819569	Apparently she killed her with a box cutter.
8821289	8823290	Hope you have a pleasant Sunday night, everybody.
8824190	8827491	But I just find it funny that there's all kinds, like, look at one of these, Rob.
8828365	8829106	Okay, I'm looking.
8829926	8830086	What?
8830647	8833049	She looks so sweet and innocent.
8833089	8834930	Yeah, I'm gonna hold up my laptop to the thing.
8835471	8840014	She looks sweet and innocent and chibi in that picture, and she's holding a little box cutter behind her back.
8840074	8842116	That is, that's disturbing!
8842816	8844518	That is downright scary!
8844538	8845999	Oh my god.
8846039	8847160	Ugh.
8848561	8850222	Loki, why do you find that so damn funny?
8851443	8853845	Because she has a box cutter and she killed a kid.
8855086	8856287	And now she's a fan.
8857867	8865992	Yeah, well, at least she's not like the ugly red-headed kid that killed some stupid kid and proposed his body in like, uh, he was on, uh, 48 hours last night.
8867533	8869034	Okay, it's up on the webcam now.
8872256	8878559	And the webcam, of course, is available over at www.orangeloungeradio.com And people are going to see my UberLeak Precious.
8879300	8879780	My laptop.
8881601	8885264	Alright, uh, we're going to go to a break and when we come back, why don't we do some Ask Orange Lounge?
8885284	8885804	How's that sound?
8887299	8888820	Can we call you Rapcon?
9000908	9002790	Look around, look at what you see
9120993	9122174	Thanks for watching!
9149000	9149540	Thanks for watching!
9217270	9218531	Orange Lounge Radio.
9218851	9221013	We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.
9226457	9227918	My god, you people are scary.
9228198	9230920	Looking at that cosplay and doujinshi.
9230960	9232641	I'm going to cosplay her at Faname.
9233602	9235083	She's 11 years old.
9236123	9239366	What's this talk of cartoon vagina in the chatroom?
9239606	9242548	Some of the pictures are of the more hentai nature.
9242908	9243428	Gross!
9243468	9243689	But...
9244622	9247524	God, as if I didn't have reason enough to be gay.
9247724	9248485	Honestly, people.
9249005	9254109	But some of the pictures are just so adorable, and it's so wrong that there's this whole fandom.
9254149	9256790	Not the hentai one.
9256990	9259392	I'm planning on cosplaying in Mockery of the Fandom.
9259952	9260233	Yeah.
9261514	9261874	Sure.
9263095	9264756	So I just got an email from Middyhead.
9264776	9269019	Apparently his broadcast went pretty good, but he didn't get a chance to record it.
9269399	9271660	I guess he was having technical difficulties right up until the last minute.
9271921	9273642	Hey, just like this show, what do you know?
9275049	9276329	Ask Orange Lounge Ask Orange Lounge
9310732	9313674	Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.
9314194	9317416	What will we find out tonight on Orange Lounge Radio?
9318217	9325541	All I know is that I hope that the station doesn't disconnect, because if it does, then we won't be having this segment again tonight.
9332725	9335107	Oh my god, there's a picture of her as one of the Battle Royale girls.
9336405	9346869	Okay, and Jazz is the first question tonight, and he's basically asking the same thing we were just talking about, saying, Why is there a Nevada vagina action?
9347629	9350370	And am I bad for laughing at this?
9352751	9358613	And it's a little picture of the girl done in ASCII art that you could use in your signature on a forum if you wanted to.
9359194	9363775	I could copy and paste that in IRC if I was feeling dumb, but I'm not going to, so...
9365661	9365881	Ask Yes
9384605	9385206	Moving on.
9385886	9386347	Dork!
9386867	9390931	Dork wants to know, where do you buy anime t-shirts online?
9391631	9392872	I don't know because I don't buy any.
9393193	9397917	If I'm going to buy Japanese-inspired t-shirts, I'm going to be shopping at English.com.
9398777	9400959	But I don't know about the anime shirts.
9401200	9402060	Any ideas, Jamie?
9404462	9405223	That's disgusting.
9405283	9407525	Jamie, any ideas about the anime shirts?
9407665	9407945	Oh, no.
9408626	9409447	Go to San Francisco.
9410147	9410568	Loki?
9413383	9415985	Um, you might try, depends on what you're looking for.
9416005	9430513	If you're looking for, um, I guess it would depend on what series you're looking for, because a lot of the film companies like ADV and stuff, they put out t-shirts along with their DVDs and stuff, so a site where you'd buy them, you'd probably be able to get the t-shirts from.
9430634	9436177	I've tried maybe RightStuff.com, and I think that's stuff with one F, and, um,
9438263	9439204	I think you might try there.
9439444	9442146	And just do fucking Google search, anime t-shirts.
9442186	9443467	I'm sure you'll pull that shit up.
9445249	9445529	Alright.
9447931	9449953	You did not just say there's a Bukkake picture.
9451174	9452194	That is disgusting.
9452254	9452715	Let me see it.
9453135	9453896	I have to see it now.
9456398	9457979	Oh my god, I'm gonna die.
9457999	9460461	Okay, Misty has a question.
9462162	9464825	Oh my god, that's disgusting!
9471175	9472196	I'm done with this show.
9472256	9475938	I'm so done.
9476258	9478659	I hate to say it, but some of them are just pretty funny.
9479860	9481360	Now, simmer down for a minute.
9481421	9482781	Let's listen to Misty's question.
9484102	9485583	You okay over there, DarkSakura?
9487304	9488424	You of all people.
9489505	9490966	You are supposed to be a good girl.
9491366	9491926	Bullshit.
9495137	9495978	Misty has a question.
9496018	9502322	Misty's question is, what is the first... Stop for a minute.
9503102	9504523	Stop with the South Park, Nevada.
9504543	9505844	Okay, listen to Misty's question.
9506525	9507125	Respect.
9508526	9509006	What's that?
9509046	9511788	What is the first Konami game that you remember playing?
9511888	9513709	It doesn't matter if it's arcade or console.
9513749	9515130	Hell, give both if you remember.
9517192	9518312	Probably Castlevania.
9518973	9520133	Castlevania was my first.
9520213	9520994	Or Twin Beasts.
9521174	9523856	Actually, as it was on the NES, Stinger.
9524525	9525425	Mmm, Stinger.
9525806	9530308	I vividly remember getting Castlevania for like my birthday or something for the Nintendo Entertainment System.
9530348	9531508	That was the first Konami game I had.
9531849	9532309	You remember?
9532329	9538092	I don't know if you remember this, but on the 8-bit Nintendo, the Konami games came in a unique sort of packaging.
9538412	9541893	Sort of like the old Activision cartridges and the Atari 2600, they all looked the same.
9542214	9543814	So did the Konami, they were all grey.
9543874	9544415	You remember that?
9544435	9545475	Yeah.
9545915	9548677	So, I remember Castlevania was the first of those games that I owned.
9548997	9549217	Uh, Angel.
9549237	9549417	Angel.
9550046	9556562	The only one I remember, I know this is going to sound completely lame because it's one of the later games, but Contra.
9557671	9561932	I used to play the hell out of Contra I remember playing Contra on one of those ones My first game was Lifeforce
9587067	9601522	That was one of the first three games I had on Nintendo because I got Breakthrough, Zelda, and I think Lifeforce were the first three games I had on Nintendo.
9601542	9604225	Of course, we know Lifeforce also as Salamander.
9604325	9607008	Yes, I know, but this was Lifeforce, not Salamander.
9609272	9618401	It's just like how what got me into DDR were the games Bust a Groove, and I know it's Bust a Move in Japan, but when I played it, it was Bust a Groove.
9618461	9624947	I didn't even know there was an import scene until I got into this DDR stuff, so I guess that's one way you could put it.
9625367	9627529	And I know Jamie loves it when I call it Bust a Groove.
9628670	9630412	Bust a Groove, Bust a Groove, Bust a Groove!
9631433	9632254	I just got the finger.
9632674	9634336	Alright, Blarg has a question.
9640560	9646904	I'm not sure if this has been asked before, but would any of you participate in some bukkake action if given the chance?
9647124	9647464	P.S.
9647504	9648165	I'm not offering.
9648305	9648505	No.
9649846	9651067	How do you know we haven't already?
9653889	9654549	I don't think so.
9655970	9658912	Unless it's like cake frosting bukkake or something.
9659452	9660813	Because cake frosting is yummy.
9661274	9662334	As opposed, yes?
9662795	9663215	Sushi.
9665516	9666137	What the hell?
9666818	9668279	You don't remember the sushi?
9668379	9668700	Yeah.
9668760	9669260	Down there?
9669280	9670041	I remember.
9670061	9670481	Over there?
9670881	9671602	Down the street?
9671822	9672443	I remember.
9673063	9673744	That's disgusting.
9673764	9674925	You're the one that mentioned it, too.
9678263	9680304	Our listeners have way too much free time on their hands.
9680324	9682565	You need to go read a book or something.
9682645	9683706	Take the other guy's advice.
9684166	9684506	All right.
9685167	9686508	John Fields has a question.
9686868	9697854	If you had your choice of getting sucked inside your TV and ending up inside of a video game, non-bomani and non-porn, Loki, no bubble bath babes for you, what game would it be?
9699075	9699915	What game would it be?
9701376	9705258	If you had to get sucked into your TV into a video game, any thoughts?
9705882	9706722	This is a weird question.
9706742	9707983	This is such a nerd question.
9709183	9711144	This is funny.
9711304	9711545	Angel.
9712345	9713445	Why do I have to go first?
9713465	9714286	Because I'm making you.
9715206	9716907	Jamie, are you going to participate in tonight's show?
9717267	9718508	I'm sorry, this is funny.
9718648	9721229	If you had to get sucked into any video game, what would it be?
9724390	9725771	Sucked into any video game?
9726291	9727512	Non-bomani, non-porn.
9729373	9732394	This is one of the top three nerdiest questions I think we've ever gotten.
9733354	9734655	I honestly couldn't say.
9739978	9743240	Probably Puyo Puyo.
9743841	9748163	Wouldn't it be cool just to walk along through the forest and solve all your problems by having a friendly puzzle game?
9752674	9758217	I was going to say Mr. Driller just because it's the game I can't stop playing right now, but that just doesn't sound right.
9758237	9762199	You'd be drilling all day long and then you'd suffocate and fly away like a little angel.
9762219	9764960	I'm good at suffocating if you've ever watched me play.
9765961	9766341	Loki.
9772424	9778387	I would have to say... That just put me in Rumble Roses because...
9781573	9810236	non-porn that's not porn fuck that shit that ain't porn Grand Theft Auto that ain't fun you'd be perfect for Grand Theft Auto no, that's too much work I'd do either Mario or Zelda because I'd have to beat all the characters' pansy asses because they're lame I'm going to defeat you with oh no, turtles are going to kill me I'd be like, fuck that shit
9810677	9811018	Marvel Madness
9823735	9825116	You just slide down the hill.
9825437	9828520	Whee!
9829921	9832704	I would have to say BurgerTime, because hamburgers are yummy.
9832744	9833786	No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
9833826	9836428	Dartitsu, you said that in the chat room, so I had to say that.
9836809	9838751	No, actually, I already had some answers thought of.
9839231	9839912	Legend of Zelda.
9840252	9840693	Yay!
9840733	9842515	Because that was just such a cute game.
9843215	9853519	or I would have to say Pokemon, because very similar to Jamie, what if we could just settle our scores by having our pets do battle instead of us, you know, just have our pets.
9853539	9855940	Jamie would sit on whatever pet you had and win.
9858448	9861089	Or... It sure means, like, Snorax, or whatever it was called.
9861489	9863009	Or... Final Fantasy IV.
9863549	9865209	Because I just have so many good memories about that game.
9865409	9868730	And I... I practically did live that game, back when I was a kid.
9869090	9871331	When I was a kid, I did live that game, okay?
9871431	9871991	So, what can I say?
9872011	9873091	I just thought of another good one.
9873311	9873491	Yes.
9873711	9874491	From the old school.
9875111	9875732	Kid Icarus.
9876732	9880433	Or Icarus, or whatever the hell you wanna... However the heck you wanna pronounce it.
9880553	9880833	You know.
9881333	9881893	Well, that was a good one.
9882293	9884253	Even the... I like some of the answers the chatroom's giving.
9884313	9886514	Even Naoki2DX says, I'd be in Katamari Damashii.
9887314	9887434	Oh!
9888652	9889593	Leisure Suit Larry.
9893775	9896536	Or BMX Triple X. Nah, BMX Triple X is too much work.
9896736	9897377	Leisure Suit Larry.
9900919	9905261	DarkLionXVI says, what do you think of my Dancer video I linked you last week?
9905321	9907082	Well, it was Dancer.
9907142	9907843	I love Dancer.
9907983	9908523	What can I say?
9908583	9909804	Dancer is fabulous.
9911745	9912805	I highly recommend Dancer.
9913085	9914786	You should go ahead and post the link in our chat.
9914806	9917548	Let the chat people see it so that they can know what I'm talking about.
9919301	9923864	What's the best way to make two brothers have sex and stay somewhat hidden with your video camera?
9923884	9924365	Drugs, lots of drugs.
9946397	9951579	Seriously, if you had them do enough ecstasy and alcohol, they would not be able to even see you there in the corner.
9951599	9953179	You'd just be another fixture.
9953199	9956801	You know like in cartoons when they're trying to disguise themselves?
9957621	9958801	You'd probably be able to join in.
9959602	9962163	You know how you could disguise yourself as a palm tree?
9962803	9963703	Or as a lamp?
9963743	9966484	No, this was just on Drawn Together a couple weeks ago.
9966744	9969885	You could disguise yourself as a lamp by just putting a lampshade on your head.
9970566	9972826	So you could do that and then have your video camera there.
9973987	9974647	And you're just a lamp.
9979059	9980019	You guys are sick.
9982520	9984761	Illusion has an Orange Lounge Radio question.
9987121	9993183	If you drop a kitty in a blender and you shuffle cards at the same time, what are you guys doing for New Year's Eve?
10002926	10005467	I think there's only one part of that question you needed to hear.
10005527	10005787	Loki.
10007230	10010331	Easy, that's what I'm doing for New Year's.
10010631	10012692	Dropping a kitty in a blender and shuffling cards.
10014212	10015813	It's kitty smoothie and poker.
10020754	10023695	Jamie, do you have a serious answer for this poor question?
10024536	10026776	I'm going to be heavily intoxicated.
10027236	10032138	Yes, whatever I do, there will be drinking involved and hopefully sex if I get my way.
10033680	10036662	Just not with two brothers, because I'm not into that.
10038163	10039123	Angel, you thinking over there?
10039183	10040704	Do you have a plot, a plan?
10043026	10048129	Not for the kitty questions, like whatever, but... I think that was just a red herring.
10048149	10049329	I don't think that was the actual question.
10049349	10050410	I think the question was New Year's Eve.
10050850	10053112	Alright, um... I don't know.
10053132	10055513	I don't know what I'm doing for New Year's or whatever.
10056134	10058455	Maybe somebody will kidnap me so we can all have a good time.
10060496	10061737	Because kidnappings are fun.
10062605	10066026	I know this is, like, way late, but I remember two things I'm mad at.
10067407	10068807	And these are both movie-related, too.
10069627	10075829	Um, I'm pissed off at Closer, because, um, Nellie Portman did not get naked.
10076790	10091655	And I'm also pissed off at this other game, or, not, this other show called, uh, My Life, or, yeah, The Life, or something like that, starring Denise Richards, and SHE DIDN'T GET NAKED IN THAT EITHER, IT'S A FUCKING UNRATED GODDAMNED DVD!
10092964	10093865	It's supposed to get naked!
10094345	10095206	NAKED!
10095546	10099628	Your Playboy fucking get naked on the goddamn- It's a foreign film, even!
10099929	10102130	Where nudity's not even a big deal, but no!
10103131	10105152	Show your tits in fucking Playboy!
10105613	10107134	The worst fucking magazine out there.
10107694	10108855	Next to Entertainment Weekly.
10110776	10111056	Anyways.
10112977	10113638	And New Year's Eve.
10115939	10117140	Uh, probably watch TV.
10117200	10118001	What did we do last year?
10118061	10121003	I watched an Iron Chef marathon and then we had sex.
10124209	10126431	That sounds like the perfect way to spend New Year's Eve.
10127432	10130774	I can't remember if it was New Year's or that was how I spent Halloween.
10131155	10135398	It was one of those holidays when we watched an Iron Chef marathon and had sex.
10137159	10138280	That could have been both, actually.
10140342	10140642	Wow.
10141563	10142224	No, it was New Year's.
10142904	10144025	Alright, anyway, that's fine.
10144325	10147468	I got invited to a party, so I'll probably go.
10147628	10148849	That's what I'm doing for New Year's.
10150934	10154177	Unless the chance to have sex comes up, then I will ditch everybody.
10155699	10156520	And it has to be good sex.
10156960	10161685	EvilMalky2DX says, Speaking of internet crazes, ever heard of the OS Girls?
10162326	10168312	If y'all don't know, basically people in Japan created anime mascots for different operating systems.
10168392	10171395	But the real question... Okay, so have you guys ever heard of this?
10172156	10173617	Actually, I have.
10173778	10174198	What do you think?
10174878	10178141	They did one that was posted on... Fuck, I don't remember now.
10178161	10183926	I think it was on Slashdot for Firefox, and they did some furry for that.
10185247	10185748	Some chick.
10185868	10195456	I didn't get to see the other ones, because the link that they posted it to didn't... I couldn't find them in the person's gallery, but it was interesting.
10195897	10196217	I think I...
10197315	10200257	I want to say I posted that in my live journal, but I can't remember if I did or not.
10200337	10201938	Nope, I know who posted it in their live journal.
10202038	10207181	But, um, someone posted it in their live journal, and I'm going to show Rob here in the studio.
10207341	10210924	Well, actually, fuck, I'm going to have to, like, go through five pages of Friends stuff to find it.
10211744	10212705	Remember who posted that?
10214646	10214906	Okay.
10215867	10217688	Anyways, Rob talk and I'll find it.
10218509	10218809	Fine.
10218889	10223592	The real question that even the Aoki2DX wants to ask is, what do y'all think of internet crazes?
10225393	10226414	I think they're funny.
10228470	10230392	I think they're funny until they get old.
10230792	10232574	I mean, like, some things are getting old.
10232654	10236057	Like, I'm sorry, because I know Jamie's a fan, but I think Strong Bad is kind of old now.
10237719	10239640	Did I say I was a fan?
10240001	10241882	Well, I just know you quote Strong Bad a lot.
10242403	10245386	It's because I live with Dan, and Dan quotes Strong Bad a lot.
10247207	10250550	I just think Homestar Runner is kind of like so last year.
10253693	10253954	All right.
10255214	10255855	Anything else?
10255895	10256596	Internet crazes?
10256636	10258278	Anybody else have a comment on internet crazes?
10259299	10261041	No, because I can't think of any at the moment.
10261902	10262983	How about the hamster dance?
10263103	10264405	That was like three years ago.
10264825	10265846	The dancing baby.
10266347	10268049	Oh, okay, the dancing baby.
10268089	10268570	Yeah, alright.
10269290	10271373	Eh, yeah, they're funny until they get old.
10272150	10275052	This is a scary comment from Dark Knight in the chatroom.
10275172	10281137	I could see the chairman starting Loki's sex romp.
10282298	10284120	You know, from Iron Chef.
10284420	10285361	Oh, I saw that picture.
10285401	10286942	There's the Firefox anime girl.
10287002	10289424	Can you, like, just post a link to chatroom or something?
10289844	10290145	No, I can't.
10291045	10291366	Why not?
10291586	10292326	Oh, because you're not in chat.
10292366	10293787	No, because I can't log in.
10293807	10294368	Oh, that sucks.
10295117	10295697	Sucks to be you.
10297358	10299299	Moving on with the questions, Ask Orange Lounge.
10299339	10306202	If you have a question, you can send it to us via private message in IRC, or you can also give us a call on the Skype line.
10306222	10309324	We're going to open up the Skype line for you boys and girls that want to give us a call over there.
10310484	10318588	Legend of Zaku says, if I were to down this death brick called the Hardee's Monster Thick Burger, I don't know if you've heard about this.
10319204	10320425	Oh, those things are humongous.
10320505	10321066	I saw one.
10321106	10321827	It looked nasty.
10322607	10329494	What Oni courses would I have to do in order to burn off the 1400 plus calories that I'm taking in as a result of this burger?
10329754	10330235	All of them.
10330375	10332016	Yeah, all of them, basically.
10332177	10333017	I'll put it this way.
10333138	10335099	Legend Road five times.
10335440	10340625	You would have to lift weights vigorously for four solid hours to burn off that many calories.
10342076	10354143	And I'm surprised Loki, I'm looking at the site right now, I'm surprised, and it's making that lightning noise right here, it's Hardee's.com, and I want Loki to see this, it's the Monster Burger.
10356365	10360808	Hardee's, of course, somewhat related to Carl's Jr., it's the Monster Thick Burger, look at that.
10361848	10364230	That's just a fucking bacon ultimate cheeseburger, that's all that is.
10366559	10368659	It's more than a bacon ultimate cheeseburger.
10368699	10369720	They're pretty humongous.
10369740	10371940	They're larger than the $6 burger.
10371980	10374681	Yeah, that's like two of those $6 patties right there.
10374781	10377061	And, like, look at whatever that sauce is right there.
10378601	10379021	Yikes.
10381922	10387003	If you go to fucking Fuddruckers, you can get one pound patties there, okay?
10387103	10389843	So that burger ain't shit, okay?
10391844	10392624	But yeah, it looks tasty.
10394378	10395439	John Fields has a question.
10395619	10400663	Hey, what if the chatroom forced Orange Lounge Radio to do a kids show like those you see on Nick Jr.
10400683	10401944	because of tonight's cage match?
10402124	10404666	What would it be like if the show were on Nick Jr. ?
10416328	10417569	We wouldn't be on Nick Jr.
10418349	10422172	I would sell this show out to anybody that would take it and I know you guys would too and if Nick Jr.
10422192	10429397	was there I would have a live studio audience filled with children and I would make DarkSakura lecture them on proper grammar all night.
10432440	10436402	And then have remedial class for their parents on how to do their fucking jobs.
10439124	10439545	Beautiful.
10441126	10442487	Last question of the evening.
10443649	10446394	From Sigurd, okay, a real question.
10447096	10450402	Are there any solid plans for an E3 show this year?
10452105	10458709	Well, I guess one of the big questions is if we even get to go to E3 in the first place.
10459170	10460691	We know DarkSakura gets to go.
10460771	10464013	Loki and I are pretty sure we're going to get to go again.
10464713	10465594	Cards look good.
10465634	10467255	If you went the year before, you can go again.
10467315	10468556	So we're kind of hoping that can happen.
10468996	10474220	So the answer is if we can get everything we need, which would include a laptop,
10474965	10475666	Hint, hint, Jamie.
10475846	10477650	Hint, hint, Jamie.
10478111	10486287	And we stay in a nice enough hotel this time where we're not in the Motel 6 in the middle of Hollywood and we instead stay at a motel that has free high-speed internet access.
10487284	10490366	Motel 7, or at least a Holiday Inn, which I think has that.
10490746	10492528	If we could do that, then yes, we could do a show.
10492628	10495009	Not necessarily from E3, but from the hotel.
10495049	10496410	But here's the other part of the question.
10496750	10500513	Would we want to spend our time in LA doing this program?
10500673	10501053	I don't know.
10501554	10502394	So, maybe.
10502955	10504856	I think if worse comes to worse, we'll do something.
10504896	10506957	We'll do lots of tape segments from E3.
10507238	10509019	We're trying to do more at E3 this year.
10509719	10511380	Assuming, we have to find out if we can go first.
10511400	10515423	But if we can go, we're hoping to get more interviews and some many more fun stuff at E3.
10515463	10515864	But again...
10517313	10519034	It's still December.
10519275	10519995	It's a little early.
10521816	10523558	So, we'll see soon enough.
10526220	10529442	Alright, that's going to do it for tonight's Ask Orange Lounge segment.
10531043	10532244	What do you say we do another break?
10532765	10534626	A quick break and come back and wrap it up.
10536007	10536728	You guys okay with that?
10537789	10538349	Works for me.
10538649	10542052	Alright, let's do a break and in this break we're going to hear... I want to hear something new.
10542072	10543433	I want to hear an Ultramix 2 song.
10543473	10543813	Let's do...
10545538	10546719	I don't know, what song sounds good to you?
10546779	10549762	Let's do the Delirium song, since we're having a Delirium night.
10550282	10550863	How's that sound?
10552524	10553125	That works for me.
10553145	10556247	Alright, we will be right back after this to wrap it up.
10556688	10557168	Stay with us.
10558569	10561572	The best is yet to come, because we all know the best part of the show is when it's over.
10563141	10568025	She knows the voices in her mind Say hello to me She says it's my nightmare
10637384	10638473	I'm the one they say to love
10676854	10677294	Hello?
10678075	10679096	Hello, is this thing on?
10679156	10679656	Testing.
10680837	10681718	Testing, one, two.
10682299	10686242	I'm looking in the index, but I don't see anything for how to run a radio show.
10686342	10686823	Hello?
10687503	10688964	I don't understand this.
10689425	10690346	Does this thing work?
10690366	10691967	This thing reads like stereo instructions.
10692027	10692648	Is this on?
10692668	10693248	What the hell?
10695810	10697212	Orange Lounge Radio.
10697392	10699594	Broke Down Ghetto Bomani Radio.
10699674	10699874	What the?
10702185	10703647	We are back to wrap it up.
10704207	10705569	Show's just about done with.
10705909	10707912	Another Sunday night, another show.
10708553	10710535	We'll be back next week with more fun stuff.
10710555	10712497	I'm going to try and line up a special guest for next week.
10712537	10715201	I want to do an interview next week, so we're going to try and line up a special guest.
10715221	10716162	Does that sound good to you guys?
10717199	10719641	Well, I thought I'd bring up the game, or I can bring it up going after the script.
10740880	10744182	Uh, that game that I like and that I got addicted to this week.
10744462	10745883	My bad, totally forgot about it.
10745923	10746743	Bring it up real quick.
10746783	10747684	Tell the folks about it.
10747704	10748224	What's it all about?
10748944	10755108	It's basically a side-scrolling RPG game called MapleStory.
10755188	10756589	Side-scrolling RPG?
10756789	10756989	Yeah.
10757049	10757969	What is that game?
10758209	10762792	It kind of reminded me of Mystical Ninja at first, but, I don't know, it's pretty cool.
10762812	10764013	I mean, you can pick up coins and stuff.
10764053	10764573	It's pretty cute.
10765348	10767949	It's one of those cutesy ones again, you know, like Ragnarok was.
10767989	10771410	It was cutesy, and it was cool, and it still is cool, but, you know.
10772390	10774311	Anyway, um, what was it?
10774451	10776992	Maple... I can't think of the website now.
10777032	10778552	MapleStory.
10778592	10779732	No, the game's MapleStory.
10781273	10784694	MapleGlobal.net or .com, I can't remember.
10785054	10791416	Anyway, for those people that want to check it out, go to MapleGlobal.com or .net.
10792616	10793356	Maybe it's .com.
10794297	10794977	I think it's .com.
10798123	10798523	It's not?
10798803	10823991	EvilNauki EvilNauki in our chatroom says MapleStory.com is the site I think it's MapleGlobal.com Anyway, that's where I found the thing to download it and register and all that stuff Sounds interesting, I might have to check this out Seems like a few people in our chat have heard of this before, so we'll see Alright, Angel's gonna hook me up with that later so I can check it out Loki, your final thought Oh, I'm sorry, Angel, is that your final thought, pretty much?
10825111	10826752	Um, bye Mr. Driller, cause it's fun
10827341	10828122	Loki, your final thought.
10828902	10830324	It is MapleStory.com.
10831404	10842274	My final thought is I'm probably going to play some more Final Fantasy tonight because I like that game and I've spent so much time on it and yeah, that's all.
10844415	10848299	Jamie, my final thought is I'm probably going to do the same thing as soon as I take Angel home.
10848939	10849860	Jamie, your final thought.
10849920	10851942	Actually, I have to run errands, which kind of sucks.
10851962	10852562	Jamie, your final thought.
10854104	10854204	Um...
10856485	10857025	Nevada.
10859908	10860328	All right.
10861789	10863851	Now you're not going to have a final word.
10864351	10865492	So I have to give the final words.
10865512	10866072	I have another one.
10866212	10866753	All right, fine.
10867753	10869235	Thank you very much for listening, everybody.
10869295	10871997	Have a great night, and thank you for supporting Orange Lounge Radio.

10936348	10937149	Thank you for watching!
10973124	10995003	Well, the workshop is gone now, he decided to vomit Everywhere you'll find pieces of Cupid and Comet And he tied up his helpers, and he held the elves hostage And he ground up poor Rudolph into reindeer sausage He got Dancer and Prancer with an old German Luger And he slashed up Stasher just like that
11047965	11064318	Yes, Virginia, now Santa's doing time In a federal prison for his infamous crime Hey, little friend, now, don't you cry no more tears He'll be out with good behavior in 700 more years

11175195	11176899	Here it is, the part after the credits.
11177840	11179684	Any exciting plans for this week, DarkSakura?
11181127	11184069	I'm sitting on my ass, maybe playing some Phantasy Star Online.
11185070	11185911	Are you getting back into that?
11186311	11187352	Yeah, I may as well.
11187992	11188773	I'm still paying for it.
11189313	11191875	You know, Episode 4 is being beta tested right now.
11192255	11192615	Oh, joy.
11192976	11194977	And apparently the card thing is gone.
11195177	11196858	Good, because the card thing was retarded.
11197539	11198340	Oh my god.
11198820	11200481	You know, this whole card craze thing?
11201542	11201662	Ugh.
11202483	11202883	Horrible.
11205339	11205839	Yeah, I agree.
11207841	11208161	I agree.
11208542	11209602	The card thing was not good.
11210063	11213305	But we talked about that a little bit on Outside the Box a couple weeks ago.
11214406	11214766	Interesting.
11216047	11217328	Loki, any exciting plans for the week?
11219550	11219750	No.
11222513	11222973	Very nice.
11223894	11225855	Angel, you got any exciting plans this week?
11225895	11226736	Y'all are pretty boring.
11230139	11231019	Nah, not really.
11231219	11233081	Maybe play some more video games.
11233921	11234562	Like I always do.
11236934	11238495	Man, what do you people do for fun?
11239375	11240115	I want Boba.
11241156	11241556	You what?
11241716	11242236	I want Boba.
11243637	11249119	I hella want Boba, but I can't go out for Boba tonight because I have errands to run.
11249179	11252060	I have to get up at 5.30 in the morning.
11252541	11253781	Boba sounds like a good time, though.
11253801	11254281	It really does.
11256962	11258063	Darn you for bringing it up.
11261556	11262657	Oh well, what can you do?
11264037	11265598	Alright, well, I guess that's it.
11265678	11267820	Unless anybody else has anything exciting they want to add?
11269721	11269961	No?
11270161	11270781	Alrighty then.
11271542	11274123	We're going to go back to our Bomani Music and More program.
11275024	11278446	Commercial free tonight, boys and girls, for a little while after the show.
11278806	11283689	We're going to start it off, though, with something special for those of you guys that stuck around, because I know a lot of you guys ditch us before the...
11285106	11292129	No, I want to play something kind of new, because it's new and desirable by people, because you don't get to hear it a whole lot.
11292509	11299272	So we're actually going to play that new remix, which we haven't really played a whole lot here on the station.
11299692	11301553	So some of you guys may actually not have heard it yet.
11301853	11303474	You know the Junk Circuit mix of I Feel?
11303994	11304574	You remember that one?
11304594	11308196	We're going to play that for you guys, who stuck around for us.
11308356	11309396	And have a great night, everybody.
11309576	11311177	Thanks for tuning in and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.
11311417	11311777	Have a good one.
11314312	11315072	Do you feel it?
11315252	11315933	Do you feel it?
