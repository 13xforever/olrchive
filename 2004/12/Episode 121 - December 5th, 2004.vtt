How you feeling, baby?

08:38.660 --> 08:44.820
And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of

08:44.820 --> 08:48.180
the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.

08:48.180 --> 08:52.860
Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bamani Music and More program.

08:52.860 --> 08:54.080
Can we talk about that?

08:54.080 --> 08:56.100
No subject will ever be taboo.

08:56.100 --> 09:00.100
Well, I was thinking maybe we should move, pump up the volume from Tuesday nights?

09:00.100 --> 09:03.100
Except, of course, the subject that was just under discussion.

09:03.100 --> 09:09.100
Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?

09:09.100 --> 09:11.100
I collect your fucking head.

09:12.100 --> 09:14.100
Just like this fucker here.

09:16.100 --> 09:19.100
Oh my God, why did you do that to Loki?

09:19.100 --> 09:23.100
The Hawk thing on Episode 69 was just a joke!

09:23.100 --> 09:30.100
Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, NOW'S THE FUCKING TIME!

09:31.100 --> 09:35.100
Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.

09:38.100 --> 09:41.100
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

09:42.100 --> 09:46.100
The lovely and wonderful Jamie there in that promo. Well, sorta.

09:47.100 --> 09:28.220
Ash

09:28.220 --> 09:30.220
NOW IS THE FUCKING TIME!

09:58.220 --> 10:01.540
You remember way back during the first year of this program when somebody had talked about,

10:01.540 --> 10:05.940
I want to say it was Dark Tetsuya was somehow involved with this, brought up the casting

10:05.940 --> 10:10.820
of the Orange Lounge movie, and they took votes in the chat room and they said that

10:10.820 --> 10:13.100
you should be played by Lucy Liu.

10:13.100 --> 10:14.100
How ironic.

10:14.100 --> 10:15.300
Which is, yeah, how ironic.

10:15.300 --> 10:17.380
A little too ironic.

10:17.380 --> 10:19.980
Especially considering you're not Asian at all.

10:19.980 --> 10:25.340
No, but you know what, I finally got something new when I went to Alabama.

10:25.340 --> 10:31.980
would be like me being played by Denzel Washington. That's funny. Anyway, sorry. Yes, Alabama.

10:31.980 --> 10:38.260
I got, I believe it was, I thought you were taller. Alright, this is a good take away.

10:38.260 --> 10:41.100
We've got to get into how was your week, how was your day, because I've got to figure out

10:41.100 --> 10:45.980
about what this is all about. So, Jamie, how was your week, how was your day? My couple

10:45.980 --> 10:52.740
of weeks were pretty decent. Very, very, very, very, very, very busy. Let's see, with my

10:52.740 --> 10:58.580
On my trip to Alabama, I got there, my mom got us lost in the way from New Orleans.

10:58.580 --> 11:00.860
We ended up heading up toward Hattiesburg.

11:00.860 --> 11:03.820
There's something stuck in this thing.

11:03.820 --> 11:07.980
Anyway, we ended up going up to Hattiesburg, and then right when mom realized where we

11:07.980 --> 11:12.180
were, we had to go around a different way, so we headed home.

11:12.180 --> 11:15.300
Got there, I didn't get in until six in the morning central.

11:15.300 --> 11:21.660
That means I had been up an official 24 hours because I woke up at four Pacific in the morning.

11:21.660 --> 11:24.820
My house crashed.

11:24.820 --> 11:29.940
Next day was Thanksgiving, but we didn't do Thanksgiving stuff, we just slept.

11:29.940 --> 11:36.180
And did some hanging out, you know, it was pretty cool.

11:36.180 --> 11:41.580
Then on Friday I went to Dozen, saw my daddy, my uncle Dale.

11:41.580 --> 11:44.340
My uncle Dale and my daddy are having their second childhoods.

11:44.340 --> 11:49.720
My uncle Dale has a- AKA midlife crisis- 2004 Mustang GT.

11:49.720 --> 11:53.880
My daddy has a Camaro.

11:53.880 --> 11:58.160
My daddy is cute on the internet because they have this old 500 megahertz kind of crappy

11:58.160 --> 11:59.160
thing.

11:59.160 --> 12:05.060
My daddy is so cute playing on it because he just hunts and pecks with his little keys

12:05.060 --> 12:06.060
and it's so cute.

12:06.060 --> 12:12.880
And my daddy sends me everything in 72-point font in email.

12:12.880 --> 12:13.880
It's adorable.

12:13.880 --> 12:15.280
I used to be that way on AOL Instant Messenger.

12:15.280 --> 12:20.840
I would type to everybody in a huge 72-point font, and they'd be like, knock it off!

12:20.840 --> 12:25.840
But I figured my chats are very important, and I want to make sure that they're not missed.

12:25.840 --> 12:34.840
Well, so Saturday, we had our official Thanksgiving at my uncle's house, and we had fried turkey.

12:34.840 --> 12:35.840
Mmm.

12:35.840 --> 12:36.840
Isn't that deep-fried turkey?

12:36.840 --> 12:37.840
Deep-fried turkey.

12:37.840 --> 12:40.400
You know how dangerous that shit is to make?

12:40.400 --> 12:41.400
Oh, but it's so young.

12:41.400 --> 12:47.600
My uncle had a very nice deep fryer with a lid and everything, and it was very gummy

12:47.600 --> 12:51.840
because it makes all of the meat just super juicy and had all kinds of things that I'm

12:51.840 --> 12:52.840
not supposed to eat.

12:52.840 --> 12:57.440
Along the way to Dawson, though, I had boiled peanuts, and I passed by two movie galleries

12:57.440 --> 13:08.000
and saluted them for you, Loki, like the single finger salute, but I had a really good time.

13:08.000 --> 13:18.880
And then that night, I went to Ground Zero, which is a comic book store with gaming tables.

13:18.880 --> 13:22.680
There were lots of people playing Yu-Gi-Oh!, and I felt really nerdy.

13:22.680 --> 13:26.040
And then, but downstairs, there's like an arcade there.

13:26.040 --> 13:27.040
It was pretty cool.

13:27.040 --> 13:31.080
That's a very strange name for an arcade, in light of recent events.

13:31.080 --> 13:33.200
Isn't it great?

13:33.200 --> 13:34.200
Okay.

13:34.200 --> 13:50.840
But there was a DDR Extreme, there was a Fourth Solo, there was a Virtual On, I played the

13:50.840 --> 14:02.200
hell out of Virtual On, and a Super Pac-Man, and I had a DS Maniacs, and a BeatMania 6

14:02.200 --> 14:09.840
It was a little bit of a Bahmani hotbed for the area, and this was in what town again?

14:09.840 --> 14:10.840
In Mobile.

14:10.840 --> 14:11.840
In Mobile.

14:11.840 --> 14:12.840
Wow, okay.

14:12.840 --> 14:15.480
For anyone living near Mobile, Alabama, it's off of Moffat Road.

14:15.480 --> 14:16.840
Way the fuck out there on Moffat Road.

14:16.840 --> 14:20.700
I would imagine anyone listening to this show in Mobile, Alabama, probably knows of that

14:20.700 --> 14:21.700
place already.

14:21.700 --> 14:22.700
I met Dork.

14:22.700 --> 14:23.700
Did you?

14:23.700 --> 14:24.700
Yes.

14:24.700 --> 14:25.700
One of our listeners.

14:25.700 --> 14:26.700
I met quite a few people.

14:26.700 --> 14:27.700
Actually, I met the...

14:27.700 --> 14:30.400
I'm supposing that he's in charge of the machines there.

14:30.400 --> 14:34.720
He goes by Pyramus Online, very very cool guy.

14:34.720 --> 14:37.160
I went to a Bamani party!

14:37.160 --> 14:38.160
What?

14:38.160 --> 14:39.600
You went to a Bamani party?

14:39.600 --> 14:40.600
Yeah.

14:40.600 --> 14:42.640
You just randomly got invited to a Bamani party down there?

14:42.640 --> 14:47.160
They were all heading over so I went over and played Ace Style on a wide screen TV and

14:47.160 --> 14:48.160
that was rad.

14:48.160 --> 14:49.160
Very nice.

14:49.160 --> 14:52.360
So you just, you went over to strangers houses to play video games?

14:52.360 --> 14:56.800
Yeah, I actually lived about a block away from where my ex-remates lived.

14:56.800 --> 14:57.800
Huh.

14:57.800 --> 14:59.520
So it was very close.

14:59.520 --> 15:06.240
And I went over, of course, to hang out with my mama's son and my papa's son, and K. Kitty

15:06.240 --> 15:09.940
and Bobby, and we had a pretty good time.

15:09.940 --> 15:10.940
We watched movies.

15:10.940 --> 15:17.580
I saw The End of the Day After Tomorrow, and no offense, but that movie sucks.

15:17.580 --> 15:18.580
I don't think so.

15:18.580 --> 15:20.580
That's my very professional opinion.

15:20.580 --> 15:23.480
I don't know a lot of people who are going to disagree with you there.

15:23.480 --> 15:24.480
My mom loves the movie.

15:24.480 --> 15:25.480
They love the movie.

15:25.480 --> 15:29.380
I don't really want to put down anyone else's opinion of it, but my opinion of it is crap.

15:29.380 --> 15:38.500
We also, I learned the fine art of DVD duplication.

15:38.500 --> 15:41.420
And so I was able to deliver a copy of Kill Bill volume two.

15:41.420 --> 15:42.420
Orange is not afraid of it.

15:42.420 --> 15:43.420
It's not advocate piracy.

15:43.420 --> 15:44.420
Yes, he did.

15:44.420 --> 15:52.380
And I got, actually, you know, there's that show, Kindred be Embraced, that came on based

15:52.380 --> 15:56.100
off of the White Wolf universe, and I have all the episodes they ever made of that, because

15:56.100 --> 15:58.680
I think that the actor died.

15:58.680 --> 16:01.880
main guy who's playing the prince

16:01.880 --> 16:05.080
but um... i have all of that i still have it on my uh...

16:05.080 --> 16:07.920
if anyone brings me dvds you'll get copies

16:07.920 --> 16:09.320
um...

16:09.320 --> 16:11.520
orange on twitter does not advocate piracy

16:11.520 --> 16:13.640
it's actually no they're not

16:13.640 --> 16:14.960
i'm just teasing

16:14.960 --> 16:18.120
they're not licensed for any more i want to find out more about this bromani party because

16:18.120 --> 16:20.860
basically you went over to a stranger's house

16:20.860 --> 16:26.280
i sang rob people that stalk us on the internet right are the you gotta

16:26.280 --> 16:34.800
Yes, okay, so message to our listeners, stalking us works, and a lot of the people though were

16:34.800 --> 16:41.320
people from DDR Freak, well that's cool, but you've got the moderatorship on DDR Freak

16:41.320 --> 16:46.440
so a lot of people know who you are over there, and then the show's getting pretty big over

16:46.440 --> 16:49.960
there thanks to the syndication on Friday nights over there on Freak Radio, so.

16:49.960 --> 16:57.280
Well, it was just a bunch of people, I met a lot of good people, we basically were just

16:57.280 --> 17:02.960
playing 8th style, played, now I brought out Karaoke Revolution.

17:02.960 --> 17:04.440
Now you don't sing karaoke.

17:04.440 --> 17:10.240
I don't, but I got the line from Avengers and Babysitting, nobody leaves without singing

17:10.240 --> 17:12.560
the blues.

17:12.560 --> 17:14.160
And that's all it took?

17:14.160 --> 17:15.880
They didn't have to feed you Guinness or anything?

17:15.880 --> 17:16.880
I was begged.

17:16.880 --> 17:19.760
They didn't make you drink Guinness or anything?

17:19.760 --> 17:20.760
You just did it perfectly sober?

17:20.760 --> 17:24.920
I just figured it's going to be about another year before I'm back.

17:24.920 --> 17:27.400
And you knew that there were no recording devices present, so...

17:27.400 --> 17:28.880
So I sang Bizarre Love Triangle.

17:28.880 --> 17:30.360
Oh, no, that's a good song.

17:30.360 --> 17:31.360
Yeah.

17:31.360 --> 17:33.560
Now, see, you missed some karaoke action here on the show last week.

17:33.560 --> 17:38.080
No, I didn't miss it, I'm sorry.

17:38.080 --> 17:39.080
Sing?

17:39.080 --> 17:40.080
All right.

17:40.080 --> 17:43.440
No, I actually, I was really, I tried to...

17:43.440 --> 17:46.360
Loki's still pissed at me over it, by the way.

17:46.360 --> 17:53.120
I actually was going to be trying to tune in on my laptop, but I had promised my mama

17:53.120 --> 17:59.000
son I was going to take her to see The Grudge, which after having... Since I was glad I

17:59.000 --> 18:05.640
saw Ju-On first, I'm very glad I saw it first, because then it was neat noting the differences

18:05.640 --> 18:06.640
in the movie.

18:06.640 --> 18:10.600
I'm not going to spoil it for anyone who hasn't, and actually the thing that pissed me off

18:10.600 --> 18:13.760
is that I don't know the reason why they think they have to explain every single last fucking

18:13.760 --> 18:19.360
detail to a U.S. audience, when it's the not knowing that is the messed up part of the

18:19.360 --> 18:24.640
movie. Even so, I thought it was very good, and even better, especially since it was done

18:24.640 --> 18:32.840
by the original director. So, we did that. I went to Steak and Shake. Steak and Shake

18:32.840 --> 18:37.360
is the best place ever. What? Steak and Shake... Only in the South, which you have a place

18:37.360 --> 18:42.680
called Steak and Shake. It's these thick hamburgers, really good. It's like a little diner type

18:42.680 --> 18:47.040
But you can get these humongous milkshakes and they make a half-and-half, but it's literally

18:47.040 --> 18:48.040
split down the middle.

18:48.040 --> 18:50.400
Half one side is one flavor, half the other is the other.

18:50.400 --> 18:53.280
So I actually mixed it up and had banana eggnog.

18:53.280 --> 18:54.280
Huh.

18:54.280 --> 18:57.000
Oh, God, it was good.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
That was orgasm in the glass.

18:59.000 --> 19:04.000
Anyway, no, it didn't taste like tuna.

19:04.000 --> 19:07.080
It tastes like banana and eggnog.

19:07.080 --> 19:09.080
Damn it.

19:09.080 --> 19:19.000
I got to meet lots of good people, had a really good time. Monday, my brother was being an

19:19.000 --> 19:26.320
ass the whole time. I'm not too proud of my brother Matthew, but I talked to my brother

19:26.320 --> 19:37.080
Phillip while I was there. He's supposed to be down for Christmas, I think. He's getting

19:37.080 --> 19:42.120
married well he's already married this is my brother who's a marine and his

19:42.120 --> 19:47.600
wife's a marine and they're actually going to Texas to have a humongous big

19:47.600 --> 19:54.700
Mexican wedding I'm going to go to be a big party will there be margaritas

19:54.700 --> 19:59.920
involved likely awesome no actually actually people that know me pretty well

19:59.920 --> 20:03.200
know that I'm actually not a big tequila fan I'll drink margaritas because you

20:03.200 --> 20:07.340
I can barely taste the tequila, but I cannot stand straight up tequila.

20:07.340 --> 20:08.800
I am a black man.

20:08.800 --> 20:11.280
You had that cheap shit here.

20:11.280 --> 20:12.280
I still don't like tequila.

20:12.280 --> 20:13.280
You can give me Cuervo.

20:13.280 --> 20:14.280
I don't care.

20:14.280 --> 20:15.280
I still don't like it.

20:15.280 --> 20:16.280
I can do shots of tequila.

20:16.280 --> 20:17.280
I think it's nasty unless...

20:17.280 --> 20:25.920
I like the blue agave tequila, the stuff that Anita had way back at the Nasty House.

20:25.920 --> 20:31.760
But it was pretty good.

20:31.760 --> 20:37.960
I went back to New Orleans on Tuesday, hung out with my mommy, I fussed at my mom, it

20:37.960 --> 20:40.960
was fun.

20:40.960 --> 20:48.320
Jamie Fuss had the most long, boring flight back.

20:48.320 --> 20:53.800
I hung out at the Dallas airport for nearly two hours.

20:53.800 --> 20:54.800
Airports aren't so bad now, though.

20:54.800 --> 20:55.800
They have Wi-Fi there.

20:55.800 --> 20:56.800
Yeah, they got Wi-Fi.

20:56.800 --> 20:58.800
I was just chilling on my laptop.

20:58.800 --> 21:01.520
Not just that, but just everything there is to do.

21:01.520 --> 21:04.600
They're practically shopping malls as well, although I would never buy anything there,

21:04.600 --> 21:05.600
but it's fun to look.

21:05.600 --> 21:07.600
You know, airports aren't that bad anymore.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.920
Well, some of them are.

21:09.920 --> 21:13.240
But I was having a pretty good time, I mean, and then I got on a plane.

21:13.240 --> 21:17.520
I read the entirety of Ramsey's The Damned on the plane.

21:17.520 --> 21:21.080
I have to say it's definitely the best Anne Rice book, because all the rest of her stuff

21:21.080 --> 21:23.080
since, it's kind of crap.

21:23.080 --> 21:24.080
It's been gay porn.

21:24.080 --> 21:26.080
Yeah, but it's also been crappy.

21:26.080 --> 21:27.080
Really crappy.

21:27.080 --> 21:34.920
really crappy woman needs to get her groove back not rest on her name

21:34.920 --> 21:40.280
although I did read the first novel of her Sleeping Beauty book uh-huh very

21:40.280 --> 21:45.440
interesting very interesting anyway that was my trip the rest of time I finished

21:45.440 --> 21:51.240
homework put up with stupid crap you talking about that Bamani party makes me

21:51.240 --> 21:55.640
nostalgic remember when we used to do that stuff at the old studio which is a

21:55.640 --> 21:59.120
really great house for having parties we have the my party we need to do that

21:59.120 --> 22:03.460
shit again yeah we do I mean we actually we kind of had a bimani party last night

22:03.460 --> 22:06.860
I mean it wasn't like a hardcore bimani party but I'm sure it will get to that

22:06.860 --> 22:10.020
as we go on through how was your week how's your day remember the stuff I

22:10.020 --> 22:14.900
would bring with me oh yeah people say the money part of my gosh shit you bring

22:14.900 --> 22:19.040
like your old I remember you brought your dreamcast pads to one party yes I

22:19.040 --> 22:25.420
did same I said okay this is what GDR was like in the old days before we had

22:25.420 --> 22:31.620
had this vivid nonsense. I remember when one of our old guests used

22:31.620 --> 22:35.540
to be on the show a bit, Samya Magus, when he put on his girlfriend's top and was playing

22:35.540 --> 22:41.660
Power Power Partise, and the picture made some rounds on the internet after that, and

22:41.660 --> 22:46.460
I remember Loki would haul his computer and his Delight Delight reduplication and his

22:46.460 --> 22:52.100
pads he'd made for it. I'm nostalgic. I would carry around the drum mania, keyboard

22:52.100 --> 22:59.380
mania 2d x controller the bunch of games all the old beat mania is my ascii pad

22:59.380 --> 23:04.660
do you think that when this ddr thing is dead which you know could happen any day now um

23:04.660 --> 23:08.980
do you think that these bimani parties stick a fork in it do you think these bimani parties

23:08.980 --> 23:14.980
are still going to be going on no we'll just go back to porn getting this we'll just have

23:14.980 --> 23:21.220
to go back to the orgies you're right how silly of me to ask

23:21.220 --> 23:25.220
I know it has to get that copy of Ally McFeel again.

23:25.220 --> 23:27.220
That was funny.

23:27.220 --> 23:29.220
Anyway, anything else you want to share about your week and your day?

23:29.220 --> 23:31.220
Uh, no.

23:31.220 --> 23:33.220
Moving right along. All right.

23:33.220 --> 23:39.220
Hey, it had a cameo by Ron Jeremy.

23:39.220 --> 23:41.220
Everything has a cameo by Ron Jeremy.

23:41.220 --> 23:49.220
Oh my god, I was looking up, um, there's a site online that's like these, uh, just paper dolls online

23:49.220 --> 23:55.300
I was trying to make a new avatar for myself on my live journal, and I accidentally came

23:55.300 --> 23:57.300
across the real doll site.

23:57.300 --> 23:59.380
Oh God.

23:59.380 --> 24:01.580
It's very, very icky.

24:01.580 --> 24:05.420
I have a request for a new DDR Freak avatar, because the gay pimp one you made me is really

24:05.420 --> 24:06.420
cool.

24:06.420 --> 24:07.420
I have a request for a new one.

24:07.420 --> 24:12.300
I want Zander from Drawn Together, just to make Seager jealous.

24:12.300 --> 24:13.300
From what?

24:13.300 --> 24:14.860
Drawn Together, that show on Comedy Central.

24:14.860 --> 24:15.860
From what?

24:15.860 --> 24:16.860
Oh girl, you are so far behind.

24:16.860 --> 24:21.340
I do not have anything but basic channels, but local channels.

24:21.340 --> 24:22.340
You're missing out.

24:22.340 --> 24:23.340
It's a funny show.

24:23.340 --> 24:24.340
I hardly ever watch TV.

24:24.340 --> 24:25.740
And I think the TV is retarded.

24:25.740 --> 24:28.820
I don't even watch Survivor or The Apprentice or any of that reality bullshit anymore.

24:28.820 --> 24:31.180
Drawn Together is like the only show I watch.

24:31.180 --> 24:32.580
And when did Hell Freeze Over?

24:32.580 --> 24:33.580
I know.

24:33.580 --> 24:34.580
I know.

24:34.580 --> 24:36.380
Do you want to talk about Hell Freezing Over?

24:36.380 --> 24:41.260
I came this close to joining a gym on Friday.

24:41.260 --> 24:51.260
For the people who didn't have that visual, Rob held his fingers the length of, um, never mind.

24:51.260 --> 24:53.260
He's not gonna talk about that.

24:53.260 --> 24:55.260
Shut up.

24:55.260 --> 24:58.260
No, because we don't bring up old drama.

24:58.260 --> 25:00.260
Yeah.

25:00.260 --> 25:02.260
What?

25:02.260 --> 25:06.260
Oh, man.

25:06.260 --> 25:09.260
It says that when you said Xander, I started thinking of Buffy.

25:09.260 --> 25:15.260
I need to respond to some stuff in the chat room going on right now.

25:15.260 --> 25:19.340
First off, Seegert is telling me he hates me because of the Xander thing and he says

25:19.340 --> 25:21.300
his is better, whatever.

25:21.300 --> 25:27.620
And somebody else, where was it, a couple of people commented, DDR is not going to die.

25:27.620 --> 25:31.180
Well, I'm only being half serious.

25:31.180 --> 25:34.860
I don't think the death of DDR is anytime soon, especially when we just got like Ultra

25:34.860 --> 25:38.440
Mix 2 and the home versions are looking very promising for the future.

25:38.440 --> 25:43.880
I don't think DDR is seriously going to die, but I think it's a little more cultish, maybe.

25:43.880 --> 25:44.880
I don't know.

25:44.880 --> 25:45.880
We'll see.

25:45.880 --> 25:46.880
I also have an announcement.

25:46.880 --> 25:47.880
Yes.

25:47.880 --> 25:49.760
I no longer am on the Atkins crap.

25:49.760 --> 25:50.760
Well, not crap.

25:50.760 --> 25:52.160
It's good for a lot of people.

25:52.160 --> 25:54.280
It was not good for me.

25:54.280 --> 25:56.520
So I can have sushi again.

25:56.520 --> 25:58.320
Congratulations.

25:58.320 --> 26:01.480
Sushi is wonderful.

26:01.480 --> 26:04.960
And and and and and and and.

26:04.960 --> 26:05.960
Nothing else.

26:05.960 --> 26:06.960
Okay.

26:06.960 --> 26:07.960
Oh, Rob.

26:07.960 --> 26:12.520
yes, what? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What?

26:12.520 --> 26:16.600
Hi! I'm back!

26:16.600 --> 26:20.260
Damn. Angel, how was your week, how was your day?

26:20.260 --> 26:23.760
You gave me a fairy to throw. Angel, how was your week, how was your day?

26:23.760 --> 26:29.080
School was school and...

26:29.080 --> 26:34.080
Oh, nothing. Saturday was nice. I just wanted to waste

26:34.080 --> 26:44.160
the week away until saturday came cuz uh well i had a birthday come on everybody yay yay yay

26:45.360 --> 26:54.160
not actually hanging out with everyone was great um and we had played lots of bumani

26:54.160 --> 27:17.160
I got to see those for the first time. That was pretty cool. And the best thing of all was obviously hanging around with the people that I don't usually get to hang around with. So, that was good. And just enjoying my birthday weekend so far, I guess.

27:17.160 --> 27:21.160
Now,

27:21.180 --> 27:25.180
Bradley, how was your week? How was your day?

27:25.200 --> 27:29.200
Alright, this week was

27:29.220 --> 27:33.220
work of course. And an interesting thing happened at work. There was

27:33.240 --> 27:37.240
a person, my kind of work is sort of a training

27:37.260 --> 27:41.260
they train people to do stuff. So, when the students came back, he had some questions

27:41.280 --> 27:45.280
for, because he was going to do a test, a state test for his line of work

27:45.280 --> 27:51.640
wanted to get into. And they come back to ask him questions and he and the instructor

27:51.640 --> 27:57.720
had a nice, somehow a disagreement or something about the instructor doesn't like this guy

27:57.720 --> 28:04.320
so he actually misspoke and said that he didn't like him. So this caused them to get really

28:04.320 --> 28:10.060
angry and start ranting and raving and then he had to go outside, the manager had to take

28:10.060 --> 28:14.880
him outside and talk for like an hour to try to calm him down. They came back on Friday

28:14.880 --> 28:20.880
And his wife told him to bring on some candy just to give to us, or something like that.

28:20.880 --> 28:25.880
And he comes back and, okay, he's like, hell, here's this candy.

28:25.880 --> 28:29.880
And then he starts launching into this big thing about discrimination!

28:29.880 --> 28:32.880
He discriminates against me! He doesn't like me!

28:32.880 --> 28:35.880
For some reason, like, some bullshit like that.

28:35.880 --> 28:40.880
And so, just me and the perceptionists are in their room and he's like,

28:40.880 --> 28:49.360
some kind of weird shit like that so good thing the boss came in like like a

28:49.360 --> 28:52.600
few minutes like a minute later and then started to talk to him so we could sneak

28:52.600 --> 28:58.320
out so I went out in the hall for about an hour while they discussed something

28:58.320 --> 29:01.040
over and over again because this is a kind of guy just like says the same

29:01.040 --> 29:05.640
thing like ten fucking times to try to make some sort of point that no one

29:05.640 --> 29:09.480
gives a shit about because he finally overreacts everything and thankfully

29:09.480 --> 29:12.740
after that, about an hour, they moved into the office and talked another hour and a half

29:12.740 --> 29:13.740
or so.

29:13.740 --> 29:16.000
Were they getting paid for this?

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
To talk?

29:17.000 --> 29:21.240
Well, it's a business, so it's part of the work.

29:21.240 --> 29:25.360
I always found that humorous when, you know, there's big fights going on and we have to

29:25.360 --> 29:28.600
sit down and have a discussion, but we're all getting paid for it type thing.

29:28.600 --> 29:31.800
We just wasted three hours of productivity to talk out.

29:31.800 --> 29:35.520
Not that I ever get into disagreements with people, but you know, I've had to sit in on

29:35.520 --> 29:36.520
them.

29:36.520 --> 29:37.520
Well, I didn't have anything to do with it.

29:37.520 --> 29:38.520
I just went and stood in the hall because I didn't want to get involved.

29:38.520 --> 29:39.820
but you got paid for it too

29:39.820 --> 29:41.520
yes it is nice one hour

29:41.520 --> 29:43.520
like an hour break

29:43.520 --> 29:44.780
not doing anything

29:44.780 --> 29:48.120
just wait until it cools down

29:48.120 --> 29:49.500
okay and then one day i got

29:49.500 --> 29:51.080
Katamari Damacy

29:51.080 --> 29:52.020
and that was a lot of fun

29:52.020 --> 29:54.820
na na na na na na na

29:54.820 --> 29:56.820
sorry every time something- it's like

29:56.820 --> 29:59.480
it's like, but everybody says, friends

29:59.480 --> 30:02.300
you think of nbc

30:02.300 --> 30:03.940
or, or when someone says 90210

30:03.940 --> 30:05.300
da da da da

30:05.300 --> 30:07.080
da da da da

30:07.080 --> 30:12.080
With Katamari it's na na na na na na na na na na na na.

30:12.080 --> 30:13.080
Shut up, Logan.

30:13.080 --> 30:15.080
No, actually, I think of that.

30:15.080 --> 30:17.080
I say that in that song too.

30:17.080 --> 30:19.080
I played that most every day this week.

30:19.080 --> 30:24.080
Actually, I did play it this week except for today because I got up.

30:24.080 --> 30:30.080
Last night was the party for Angel and Anita, or Dee Dee Archipolic, for their birthdays.

30:30.080 --> 30:36.080
And that was a lot of fun because Navi brought over 8 style and pop music.

30:36.080 --> 30:39.400
god bless the town's pop and music horror.

30:39.400 --> 30:43.240
I got to play on those arcade-style controllers.

30:43.240 --> 30:48.280
Yeah, and that was fun.

30:48.280 --> 30:51.680
Of course, I didn't do all that great on 8th style, because basically,

30:51.680 --> 30:57.240
he had it up on a stand, and then the TV was down like two or three feet,

30:57.240 --> 30:58.600
several feet away.

30:58.600 --> 31:00.840
And of course, I hadn't played on an arcade-style controller

31:00.840 --> 31:02.240
in a long time.

31:02.240 --> 31:05.320
And of course, there was the hard new song.

31:05.320 --> 31:19.320
just like, oh god, like, oh what the hell is it called? Nebulagraspur? Nebulagraspur is a fucking impossible. Well at least for a first try it's like, oh fuck, what the hell? Like all over the place.

31:19.320 --> 31:37.320
And I always love non-Bamani people, like the people who don't really play 2DX, DDR, and stuff. I always love their reaction to stuff like that, because there were a few people at the party last night who don't really play DDR or 2DX, and they were just kind of watching Navi playing, and just like he was just crazy. He was playing like Nebio Grasp or another or something, and just everybody was just kind of like,

31:38.320 --> 31:45.320
That's crazy. That is so crazy. Man, that's crazy.

31:45.320 --> 31:50.160
Yeah, actually I played Pop music for the first time ever because it's the first time

31:50.160 --> 31:54.880
I've actually been to anything where it's been brought out and actually passed like

31:54.880 --> 32:05.000
a, I think I backed to 22 on 9's button, that was pretty good, and today we got up

32:05.000 --> 32:09.920
late so it didn't do that all that much and that's all.

32:09.920 --> 32:14.840
Mr. Loki, how was your week, how was your day?

32:14.840 --> 32:30.840
Today did not start out too good, due to certain events that have taken place outside of our apartment complex in the street. It was not fun. Well, we'll get into that later, I'm sure.

32:30.840 --> 32:44.840
And then yesterday, it was okay. I went down to Knights Ferry to go ghost hunting supposedly, and just walked around there for a little bit. It was fun, hiking and stuff.

32:44.840 --> 32:50.840
Friday wasn't that good either. Grandparents, er, grandma died, so that sucked.

32:50.840 --> 33:06.840
Thursday, I can't remember Thursday. Thursday was okay, I guess. Most of the week I've been just playing Final Fantasy XI, leveling my summoner to 20, which I just finished right before the show.

33:06.840 --> 33:17.840
And, um, what else have I been doing? I've played a little bit of Grand Theft Auto, finally passed this mission, and I couldn't beat for a while, and now I have to run errands for some pimp.

33:17.840 --> 33:27.840
And, um, went and saw Closer. I'll get into that later. And, um, eh, that's about all.

33:27.840 --> 33:33.840
It's been, like, kind of a week just crashing into the ground.

33:33.840 --> 33:37.680
That sucks about your grandma, I'm sorry to hear it.

33:37.680 --> 33:40.960
Have you used your machine to try and contact her yet?

33:40.960 --> 33:45.680
No I have not, you asshole.

33:45.680 --> 33:46.680
Anyway...

33:46.680 --> 33:51.000
How did you ever open your portal to hell?

33:51.000 --> 33:53.840
You went on a ghost busting trip yesterday, didn't you?

33:53.840 --> 33:54.840
Hunting.

33:54.840 --> 33:56.400
Ghost hunting, not busting.

33:56.400 --> 34:01.000
We just, we went, walked around Knights Ferry, which is basically this old abandoned, it's

34:01.000 --> 34:06.660
not really an abandoned mining town. It's just an old mining town. It's got like a bunch

34:06.660 --> 34:11.340
of dilapidated... It's not really a mining town, I guess. They have an old mill there

34:11.340 --> 34:16.900
that's kind of been... It's just the ruins of it. So we just walked around there. They

34:16.900 --> 34:22.920
also have a very long... They have a 150 meter covered bridge, which is pretty neat, and

34:22.920 --> 34:28.400
we walked down that and we went to their graveyard that was there and walked around that for

34:28.400 --> 34:32.960
a little bit but you know I mean these are just for is just kind of just to get

34:32.960 --> 34:37.740
out of the house we you know we're looking for like an actual place that my

34:37.740 --> 34:43.180
my example was something that's more trauma there than you know old you know

34:43.180 --> 34:47.540
because necessarily just visiting any old place is not going to work you need

34:47.540 --> 34:50.840
to have something where oh yeah 50 people murdered there you know that kind

34:50.840 --> 34:55.180
of thing just something you know traumatic like a insane asylum or

34:55.180 --> 35:02.180
kostjamrh And by tired he means looking for a party in Final Fantasy 11 so he can get a summoner to level 3.

35:25.180 --> 35:42.180
At it? No, I was tired from other things, but yes, I just got bored with that too. But the other things in the morning made me tired because I'm exhausted right now from having to wake up early yesterday and having to wake up early today.

35:42.180 --> 35:53.180
Alright, my turn. My week and my day. I got to play 8th style and pop music 10 twice this week, actually, because I hung out with Navi on Monday. I'll talk about those games a little bit later, because, you know, I don't want to talk about my money stuff in a little bit.

35:53.180 --> 36:02.180
But, Navi and I, after playing some of that, we got to go to the mall, and I was going to help him do some Christmas shopping over at Arden Fair, which is a big mall in Sacramento. It's a huge mall.

36:02.180 --> 36:11.180
And so, we ended up walking out of there. He didn't end up buying anything. He just kind of looked around us in different places. And I fucking bought an iPod at the Apple store.

36:11.180 --> 36:16.180
cuz I wanted one really I I wanted one really bad

36:16.180 --> 36:18.180
I'm still two away from my free one

36:18.180 --> 36:22.180
I don't just buy a fucking iMac you know just join the cult

36:22.180 --> 36:24.180
I thought about it actually

36:24.180 --> 36:28.180
good it's a big fleeing piece of shit that doesn't do anything

36:28.180 --> 36:30.180
you make Apple users cry anyway

36:30.180 --> 36:31.180
unless you're into graphics

36:31.180 --> 36:34.180
or media which you know this show happens to be

36:34.180 --> 36:36.180
cuz all the pros are on Macs

36:36.180 --> 36:39.180
maybe we wouldn't have the freaking buzz on a Mac

36:39.180 --> 36:40.180
anyway

36:40.180 --> 36:42.180
Hey, you wouldn't have any of the software either!

37:10.180 --> 37:14.660
eject CDs anymore and now I won't even play the CD that's in there. So luckily

37:14.660 --> 37:18.380
though it has an auxiliary port in it so I can plug anything I want in there so

37:18.380 --> 37:21.380
I'm just like fuck it I'm gonna get an iPod and I'll just use that as my car

37:21.380 --> 37:24.460
stereo. So it's worked out really well except for the fact that if you think

37:24.460 --> 37:27.940
somebody if you think I'm bad when I'm talking on my cell phone and trying to

37:27.940 --> 37:31.580
drive you should see me when I'm trying to find the song on my iPod I want to

37:31.580 --> 37:37.380
hear and drive at the same time. It's beautiful and you know what they can

37:37.380 --> 37:41.040
pass all the laws they want to say I can't talk on my cell phone and drive

37:41.040 --> 37:41.420
but

37:41.420 --> 37:45.580
I don't see them making any law anytime soon that says I can't play on my iPod and try

37:45.580 --> 37:46.980
to drive at the same time so

37:46.980 --> 37:51.140
look out. I believe the law is operation of electronical devices while driving

37:51.140 --> 37:54.900
so your iPod is included. God dammit!

37:54.900 --> 37:57.940
Your car is technically an operational device.

37:57.940 --> 38:01.540
extraneous like CD, well like

38:01.540 --> 38:04.420
laptops, peripheral devices

38:04.420 --> 38:10.380
Secret in our chat room right now over at orangelandrader.com, he says that that day

38:10.380 --> 38:16.520
where my Echo Image CD got eaten by my car stereo player, he said that that day kind

38:16.520 --> 38:20.660
of pissed him off, except for the Classic Gaming Expo and the little girl that was hitting

38:20.660 --> 38:22.860
all the buttons on the restrooms that she rocked.

38:22.860 --> 38:27.100
And that reminds me, I actually found the picture of Jamie doing that at Classic Gaming

38:27.100 --> 38:28.100
Expo.

38:28.100 --> 38:30.380
I had my heads in the air.

38:30.380 --> 38:31.380
What was it?

38:31.380 --> 38:32.380
We paid you $10 to do it?

38:32.380 --> 38:33.380
Yeah.

38:33.380 --> 38:35.380
I wanted on Pac-Land for the TurboGrafx.

38:35.380 --> 38:37.380
Yeah, we bought some game for you, basically.

38:37.380 --> 38:39.380
For you to imitate little girl. I found the picture.

38:39.380 --> 38:41.380
I'm gonna send it to Seagurd.

38:43.380 --> 38:46.380
By the way, we're going to Classic Gaming Expo again this year.

38:46.380 --> 38:47.380
Even though...

38:47.380 --> 38:48.380
It's in Burlingame.

38:48.380 --> 38:50.380
Even though last year was kinda...

38:50.380 --> 38:54.380
The only reason that last year's was end was because they had that thing a few days before.

38:54.380 --> 38:57.380
But, uh, Classic Gaming Expo this year is gonna be in Burlingame.

38:57.380 --> 38:59.380
That means trips to network video!

38:59.380 --> 39:03.380
And the store that sells the airsoft guns.

39:29.380 --> 39:32.560
of it and I don't know what it was we were playing cranium but it wasn't just

39:32.560 --> 39:36.340
regular cranium but it was turbo cranium okay so it's supposed to be like a

39:36.340 --> 39:40.100
faster version of cranium like one that you could play like in an hour the

39:40.100 --> 39:44.940
freaking game took us three hours to play the last time I played cranium it

39:44.940 --> 39:48.940
only took two turbo cranium ended up taking longer what in the hell is up with

39:48.940 --> 39:52.460
that and no it's not because we kept taking breaks it just was a long-ass

39:52.460 --> 39:57.140
game was no shorter nobody's gonna get this joke but you Rob but you can be my

39:57.140 --> 40:04.400
puppet master anytime how foul hey but how long did the I had ended up having

40:04.400 --> 40:07.760
to leave around midnight because I was kind of afraid well a I was tired and B

40:07.760 --> 40:10.360
I was afraid I wasn't gonna be able to park when I got back here if I waited

40:10.360 --> 40:14.780
any longer but how was the rest of the night good we ended up playing hear me

40:14.780 --> 40:22.200
out well the majority of the night I mean we played pop in ten also but yeah

40:22.200 --> 40:28.280
that other game was kind of weird also um a DD alcoholic made sushi from

40:28.280 --> 40:30.840
scratch it was really good but it was kind of interesting because she used

40:30.840 --> 40:34.980
wieners in it like she used hot dogs and instead of fish she put like hot dogs in

40:34.980 --> 40:38.600
there but it was actually really good it was kind of weird I just thought was

40:38.600 --> 40:44.240
neat it was very resourceful it was a good idea anyway uh we're gonna take a

40:44.240 --> 40:46.360
break when we come back from this break we're gonna talk a little bit more about

40:46.360 --> 40:50.400
2d x8 style we're gonna talk a little more about pop music 10 I want to play

40:50.400 --> 40:56.140
the new remix of I Feel for you guys. We played it on Thursday night, but I know nobody listens

40:56.140 --> 40:59.020
to Outside the Box on Thursday night, but more of you guys listen tonight, so we're

40:59.020 --> 41:05.460
going to play the new I Feel mix from, I keep calling it Service Pack, Song Pack 7 from

41:05.460 --> 41:07.600
UltraMix 2, because a lot of people don't want to hear that, so we're going to play

41:07.600 --> 41:11.540
that for you guys. And plenty more when we come back from this break. In this break though,

41:11.540 --> 41:15.740
some music from DDR Festival, because we haven't really gotten to hear much music from DDR

41:15.740 --> 41:19.980
Festival yet, but we have some songs for you guys. We're going to hear Superstar, Diamonds,

41:19.980 --> 41:26.980
Cutie Honey on this break. We'll be right back.

41:49.980 --> 41:53.980
And it feels good as to if I've been cooking

41:53.980 --> 41:56.980
Does that really want to laugh at you?

41:56.980 --> 42:02.980
I'm feeling some connection to the things you do

42:02.980 --> 42:06.980
I don't know what it is that makes me feel like this

42:06.980 --> 42:08.980
I don't know who you are

42:08.980 --> 42:13.980
But you must be some kind of superstar

42:13.980 --> 42:18.980
Cause you got a lot to do no matter where you are

42:48.980 --> 42:52.980
Cause you gotta love it no matter where you are

42:52.980 --> 42:56.980
Where you are, I wanna take you there

44:22.980 --> 44:24.980
I know

44:24.980 --> 44:26.980
I'm your Doki-chan

44:26.980 --> 44:28.980
This time

44:28.980 --> 44:30.980
I am your

44:30.980 --> 44:32.980
Kangaro-mon-to

44:32.980 --> 44:34.980
I am your

44:34.980 --> 44:36.980
Doki-chan

44:36.980 --> 44:38.980
This time

45:38.980 --> 45:39.980
Hey!

45:39.980 --> 45:40.980
Hey!

45:40.980 --> 45:41.980
Hey!

45:41.980 --> 45:42.980
Hey!

45:42.980 --> 45:43.980
Hey!

45:43.980 --> 45:44.980
Hey!

46:14.980 --> 46:23.980
Mr. Random person on the street, who by the way is not an actor. What do you think of the Orange Lounge big money music and more shows?

46:23.980 --> 46:36.980
The music is like being transported to this dancing spaceship place. It's unearthly. It's like being in a club, except you don't have to ask someone to dance.

46:36.980 --> 46:43.760
We are back here on orange lounge radio festival has some strange music in it. It's honestly I didn't bother to buy festival

46:43.760 --> 46:49.020
I just I didn't think there was enough in it for me because I had extreme and I have an Xbox so and I had

46:49.100 --> 46:54.080
Ultra mix one which were a lot of songs came from but festival certainly has some quirky little songs in it, doesn't it?

46:54.900 --> 46:57.820
Interesting. It's all I have to say although I love superstar

46:57.820 --> 47:02.000
I it's almost worth buying the mix for that but not really because that's like 80 bucks

47:02.000 --> 47:20.000
Yeah it does have different steps for a lot of the songs that were on UltraMix 1, but I don't know, honestly with UltraMix 2 now and the fact that you can make your own edits, I have a feeling that any day now we're going to start seeing those steps get uploaded to Xbox Live, so I'm not really too concerned about it.

47:20.000 --> 47:24.000
It's just somebody has to take the effort and that person is not going to be me because I'm lazy.

47:24.000 --> 47:28.000
Anyway, 2DX8 style.

47:28.000 --> 47:32.000
Got a chance to check it out over at, um, Navi, POD Music Horror.

47:32.000 --> 47:36.000
He has it. I got to check it out earlier this week. And man do I suck at 2DX now.

47:36.000 --> 47:40.000
I mean seriously, I haven't played 2DX seriously in quite a while.

47:40.000 --> 47:46.000
I didn't really get into 7th style. I played it one time. A lot of this has to do with the fact that my controller is broken.

47:46.000 --> 47:58.000
And I'd rather buy myself a lot of other useless crap, like iPods and things like that, than buy a new 2DX controller, and I seriously think that's the reason that I haven't been playing a whole lot of 2DX.

47:58.000 --> 48:02.000
But 8 style is pretty sweet, I gotta say. It has a lot of great new songs in it.

48:02.000 --> 48:07.000
Those of you guys that listen to this show regularly, you already know how I feel about Everyday Lovely Day, like I love that song.

48:07.000 --> 48:10.000
And then of course it has a bunch of 2DX Red songs in it.

48:10.000 --> 48:14.400
Well, not a bunch, but three, which I consider to be a bunch for, you know, preview, because

48:14.400 --> 48:17.640
usually it's only like one or two.

48:17.640 --> 48:21.640
And then, some of the new consumer videos are pretty funny.

48:21.640 --> 48:25.000
Like Step Into the New World, I don't really like that song a whole lot, the song kind

48:25.000 --> 48:29.040
of, meh, but the video's pretty great, like with the anime and everything and the guy

48:29.040 --> 48:33.140
running down the street, and he uses his computer animation technique that's very interesting,

48:33.140 --> 48:38.160
like it turns these 2D settings into 3D, kind of like Parappa the Rappa, it looks like that,

48:38.160 --> 48:39.840
except not drawn.

48:39.840 --> 48:43.280
I guess that makes no sense whatsoever, I don't care.

48:43.280 --> 48:46.700
And then also another video I love is Love Box.

48:46.700 --> 48:50.580
I don't know if you guys got to see this video at all, but Love Box is the one that has,

48:50.580 --> 48:56.120
I think it's Meg, and one of her cohorts or something, I don't know, an uncredited person.

48:56.120 --> 49:00.380
They're dressed up as these like Austin Powers dance chicks, kind of.

49:00.380 --> 49:04.780
Like they're all dressed in these like 60s hippie, like things you'd see on Laugh-In.

49:04.780 --> 49:06.240
You remember that old show Laugh-In?

49:06.240 --> 49:08.000
Like when the people would be dancing?

49:08.000 --> 49:12.100
It was kind of like that and they're just driving around the city and singing and they're

49:12.100 --> 49:14.540
wearing like glow bracelets and stuff.

49:14.540 --> 49:16.180
It's really great.

49:16.180 --> 49:17.180
Love box.

49:17.180 --> 49:19.180
I highly recommend this one.

49:19.180 --> 49:24.960
Although the song kind of sucks, but the video is great.

49:24.960 --> 49:27.140
So you guys have gotten to play 8 style a little bit too.

49:27.140 --> 49:30.500
What do you guys think of 2DX8 style?

49:30.500 --> 49:33.140
I suck at Let Me Go of Bara.

49:33.140 --> 49:34.740
Oh I remember that song was so great.

49:34.740 --> 49:37.180
And the scene kept falling out of my lap.

49:37.180 --> 49:41.120
I miss arcades.

49:41.120 --> 49:44.600
Were you playing on a regular, like, little controller?

49:44.600 --> 49:48.080
Yeah. See, Navi has one of those arcade-style controllers, so you don't have to put it in your lap.

49:48.080 --> 49:50.160
But they're kinda loud, like, they're really...

49:50.160 --> 49:53.440
those arcade-style ones are really loud. Like, you could hear that thing probably

49:53.440 --> 49:55.040
outside, like, a mile away.

49:55.040 --> 49:59.160
Clack, clack, clack. But that's pretty neat. And sometimes it kinda overpowers the music,

49:59.160 --> 50:02.400
but it plays beautifully. It plays so beautifully.

50:02.400 --> 50:05.320
Arcadian, what do you think of 2DXC's style?

50:05.320 --> 50:07.120
look pretty nice

50:07.120 --> 50:09.060
something you think you might have to break down a purchase

50:09.060 --> 50:12.240
I already have purchased it. Oh, have you? I just haven't gotten it yet.

50:12.240 --> 50:14.440
You probably mentioned it, I forgot.

50:14.440 --> 50:19.340
Yeah, I mentioned it like two weeks ago. That's right. I forgot.

50:19.340 --> 50:20.720
Any

50:20.720 --> 50:25.560
particularly favorite consumer songs that you like, any of these songs?

50:25.560 --> 50:27.600
I haven't heard them enough to

50:27.600 --> 50:29.920
truly say yet.

50:29.920 --> 50:34.400
I played a new seven star. I think it was Don't Be Afraid Myself was one of the

50:34.400 --> 50:38.160
like it's the j-pop one that's got a really especially got a pretty great

50:38.160 --> 50:43.480
that's got a pretty cool video in the bathroom in the shower I think so I

50:43.480 --> 50:46.760
think they were dancing in like a locker room shower yes I think that might have

50:46.760 --> 50:50.320
been it I could only kind of half see the video that's cool yeah the song is

50:50.320 --> 50:54.640
cool but man I fucked up that song so bad like it really shows like how out of

50:54.640 --> 50:58.160
it on 2dx I am because I can't sight read anymore like I was able to play

50:58.160 --> 51:01.560
attitude and star dream and all these songs I used to play all the time on

51:01.560 --> 51:06.080
eight style

51:06.080 --> 51:10.380
just fine

51:10.380 --> 51:14.160
but dancer

51:14.160 --> 51:18.480
is it just me or is it something kind of weird at the end of the video

51:18.480 --> 51:21.360
it freezes kind of at the end of the video

51:21.360 --> 51:25.540
I remember it kinda faded out in the arcade

51:25.540 --> 51:30.440
but a lot of eight style machines had broken videos in the first place so that was the first time that a lot of people got to actually play

51:30.440 --> 51:35.720
of the videos? I don't know. Pretty cool. Angel, what were your thoughts on T-X-A-Style?

51:35.720 --> 51:41.600
Love Is Orange, Attitude, and A. That's all I have to say. Because, you know, I used to

51:41.600 --> 51:45.480
watch you guys play that all the time, and I was always all envious, and I still am,

51:45.480 --> 51:50.440
so, yeah. A is technically a seventh style song, but

51:50.440 --> 51:54.120
it does make, well, I know, but it does make a repeat in eighth style. It's interesting,

51:54.120 --> 51:59.840
they take, they took some of the most noteworthy seventh style songs, like A and Stoic, and

51:59.840 --> 52:02.620
They ended up repeating on 8th style after all, so now I'm kind of like, do I really

52:02.620 --> 52:04.300
need to get 7th style?

52:04.300 --> 52:09.020
But then I remembered, yes, I want to hoard Beauty of Silence in the privacy of my own

52:09.020 --> 52:10.900
home, is basically what it boils down to.

52:10.900 --> 52:14.340
Just like, remember the old arcade days, frickin' everybody hoarded Beauty of Silence, well,

52:14.340 --> 52:15.780
almost everybody.

52:15.780 --> 52:20.660
I know I was a big part of that, but, like, player's best would be 5-1-1, because all

52:20.660 --> 52:26.260
the noobs would play 5-1-1, and then, like, Beauty of Silence.

52:26.260 --> 52:27.260
Anyway.

52:27.260 --> 52:31.260
Poppin' Music 10 was another game I got to check out earlier this week.

52:31.260 --> 52:36.260
Pretty cool. I have to admit, I think I kind of like the way 9 is set up a little bit better.

52:36.260 --> 52:42.260
I thought the unlock system in 9 was a lot cooler, because 10 has this wacky roulette thing.

52:42.260 --> 52:48.260
Navi had the timing down perfect, though, so that he was managing to unlock quite a bit of stuff on the roulette wheel.

52:48.260 --> 52:56.260
But it was kind of yawned to me, because the Gambler Z thing in 9 was way cooler, where you could walk around and unlock things and play songs and stuff.

52:56.260 --> 53:00.380
I was a little disappointed by that. But the song list was pretty good in 10. There's a

53:00.380 --> 53:03.820
lot of great songs I love in 10. Of course, Goonies, you know, we hoard that song like

53:03.820 --> 53:08.140
crazy here on Orange Lounge. Arabatia, the Revenge song, love that song. And I actually

53:08.140 --> 53:13.140
passed it on E, what is it, what's the second one up? Not EX, that's the third one up. Hyper?

53:13.140 --> 53:17.900
Is that the second level? It's like Basic and Hyper. See, I don't know my pop music,

53:17.900 --> 53:22.580
it's so sad. The middle one, wherever it's ranked, like a 30 or something. 29, 30, I

53:22.580 --> 53:31.860
Somebody needs to get me $1,000 for Christmas, so that way I can buy an ASC for 2DX, an ASC

53:31.860 --> 53:37.940
for pop music, and then import 8 style and as many pop music as I can before I'm bankrupt.

53:37.940 --> 53:45.820
So if you guys want to get me $1,000 for Christmas, that would be great.

53:45.820 --> 53:49.820
Did you play Popin' 10 at all at that party that you went to, Jamie?

53:49.820 --> 53:53.820
I didn't have Popin' 10. I bought Popin' 9 with me, but we ended up not playing it.

53:53.820 --> 53:57.820
Oh. Okay. Well, what did you think of Pop Music 10, Angel?

53:57.820 --> 54:01.820
It was pretty, and watching Navi play is just

54:01.820 --> 54:05.820
insane. He plays

54:05.820 --> 54:09.820
faster than anyone else I've seen, you know, but

54:09.820 --> 54:13.820
I just ended up watching it because I knew a lot of people wanted to play

54:13.820 --> 54:20.700
pop and 10, so I just kind of left it at that, plus we were busy with Cranium anyways, so,

54:20.700 --> 54:21.700
you know.

54:21.700 --> 54:28.020
Yeah, by the way, if anybody wants to call us, we just opened up the Skype line, if you

54:28.020 --> 54:32.260
want to figure out what that's all about, head on over to www.orangelaunceradio.com

54:32.260 --> 54:36.060
and click on interact with us, and we want to take some phone calls asking you guys that

54:36.060 --> 54:39.820
have gotten a chance to play 8 style or pop music 10, what you guys think of it.

54:39.820 --> 54:44.800
I have to say that the final verdict on Ten, I kind of, I mean obviously I need to play

54:44.800 --> 54:48.960
it more, and obviously I still want it, but I still think I kind of like Nine just a little

54:48.960 --> 54:53.960
bit better. I just think Nine had some, just set up a little better, just kind of had some

54:53.960 --> 54:58.120
better songs, but Ten's really good, don't get me wrong. I would still buy Ten in a heartbeat,

54:58.120 --> 55:05.120
but I just think I like Nine a little bit better. But, anyway. Arcadian, you got to

55:05.120 --> 55:10.520
play a little bit of pop in 10 what'd you think? Not bad. I can't compare it to any

55:10.520 --> 55:13.560
other ones because I haven't played any other ones. Oh, I thought you have played the other

55:13.560 --> 55:17.380
ones. No, this is the first time I've ever played it. Oh, wow, okay. So that's why you

55:17.380 --> 55:21.120
were playing five key in the beginning there. I was kind of like, Katie is playing five

55:21.120 --> 55:26.020
key. I was playing like three songs and I said, let's go tonight. And it's okay to play

55:26.020 --> 55:29.560
five key when you're first learning pop music, that's okay. Let's get, we're going to take

55:29.560 --> 55:34.840
call real fast. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Hey there, Sky, Siggy here. Hi Siggy,

55:34.840 --> 55:41.160
how you doing? I'm doing fine. You know what, I finally figured out what you were talking

55:41.160 --> 55:44.760
about last week with the 2DX8 style. You remember how you said there was something in it that

55:44.760 --> 55:48.760
looked like extreme US and a lot of people in the chat were going, what the fuck is he

55:48.760 --> 55:53.000
talking about? You remember that? Yeah. I got what you meant now. It was the menu in

55:53.000 --> 55:57.120
the beginning kind of have that like round wheel thing?

55:57.120 --> 56:02.440
Yeah, it's the menu. Gotcha. So, you got your copy of Eight Cell, yes?

56:02.440 --> 56:04.320
Yup. And how have you been enjoying it?

56:04.320 --> 56:08.600
Yeah, I'm enjoying it. It's really good. I was one of the lucky ones who got the 2DX

56:08.600 --> 56:12.880
Red E amusement card, because after November 18th, they don't have it anymore.

56:12.880 --> 56:14.080
Really? Yeah.

56:14.080 --> 56:17.800
So is there anything special about the card, or is it just the fact that, hey, I got a

56:17.800 --> 56:21.920
card? Actually, I wanted to use this 2DX Red E

56:21.920 --> 56:26.000
the amusement card at AI because they have the amusement card readers.

56:26.000 --> 56:27.000
That's what I heard.

56:27.000 --> 56:32.200
Now, I'm actually going to be able to go to Arcade Infinity next week.

56:32.200 --> 56:33.200
I'm hoping.

56:33.200 --> 56:34.760
The amusement card over there.

56:34.760 --> 56:38.520
Well, I don't have any amusement card because I'm ghetto poor and I haven't bought any.

56:38.520 --> 56:39.520
Buy it over there.

56:39.520 --> 56:40.520
That's what I meant.

56:40.520 --> 56:41.520
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking about doing.

56:41.520 --> 56:42.520
I'm thinking about buying...

56:42.520 --> 56:45.960
Depending on how much they cost, I might buy a bunch and give some away here on the station.

56:45.960 --> 56:46.960
I'm thinking about it.

56:46.960 --> 56:47.960
Yeah, that's cool.

56:47.960 --> 56:48.960
Yeah.

56:48.960 --> 56:49.960
Thinking about it.

56:49.960 --> 56:55.960
Yeah, recently I double A'd a V35 on 7key.

56:55.960 --> 57:01.960
See, V35 is one of those songs I used to be really good at, but then I just suck it up now. What is that you're holding up there? A Namco?

57:01.960 --> 57:04.960
My Tekken 5 character data card.

57:04.960 --> 57:09.960
Get on topic! No, it's cool. Have you gotten to play pop music 10 at all?

57:09.960 --> 57:15.960
Uh, no. The last time I played pop music was Pop Music 9 back in San Francisco.

57:15.960 --> 57:17.960
See, but isn't Pop Music 9 great?

57:19.960 --> 57:20.960
I think so, anyway.

57:21.960 --> 57:25.960
So, anything else you want to share about 2DX8's style, your experiences you're having with it?

57:26.960 --> 57:27.960
Well, um...

57:28.960 --> 57:30.960
There's a thing about the...

57:31.960 --> 57:34.960
Getting the hidden songs, the 2DX1 songs.

57:35.960 --> 57:36.960
You don't have to...

57:37.960 --> 57:38.960
About the easy thing.

57:39.960 --> 57:40.960
It turns out to be false.

57:41.960 --> 57:42.960
What do you mean?

57:42.960 --> 57:54.960
You can't play easy songs by unlocking spiral galaxy and taio. By using an easy option.

57:54.960 --> 57:56.960
So you can't play an easy to unlock those songs?

57:56.960 --> 57:57.960
You can.

57:57.960 --> 57:58.960
Oh you can?

57:58.960 --> 57:59.960
Yeah.

57:59.960 --> 58:01.960
Well shit, that makes it easy doesn't it?

58:01.960 --> 58:05.960
And what is the requirement again to start unlocking some of these 2DX Red songs? Because I actually don't remember.

58:05.960 --> 58:11.960
Play at least about a hundred songs to unlock Spiral Galaxy and Taiyou.

58:12.960 --> 58:14.960
Wow. A hundred songs?

58:15.960 --> 58:20.960
Well, yeah, just mostly Light Sevens, or Light Seven to Seven Key songs.

58:21.960 --> 58:24.960
I'm not afraid of playing Seven Key. I've got to play some more to get better at it.

58:25.960 --> 58:28.960
I want Light Seven, just for the heck of it.

58:28.960 --> 58:34.200
I would play, now see Light 7 would be the kind of thing I would play to

58:34.200 --> 58:39.440
whore my VJ Army account up if I had one. Hypothetically if I had one. I'd be all

58:39.440 --> 58:43.560
look at all these triple A's I got. Of course it was on Light 7. But man,

58:43.560 --> 58:47.480
I'm good. Cause I know, I know that there's people out there that do that.

58:47.480 --> 58:50.840
I mean but that's okay you know Light 7's are songs too. You have every right.

58:50.840 --> 58:54.480
But you know. And there's another for random

58:54.480 --> 58:58.320
plus. You have to play at least a hundred songs to unlock random plus.

58:58.320 --> 59:01.320
And what exactly does Random Plus do again for those that...

59:01.320 --> 59:05.320
Uh, Random Plus is where the turntable is now included in the shuffle.

59:05.320 --> 59:08.320
Oh. Oh, okay, I gotcha.

59:08.320 --> 59:13.320
Oh, that would be so hard if you got some scales that, oh god, that's really crazy.

59:13.320 --> 59:16.320
Especially, you know, especially War Game.

59:18.320 --> 59:19.320
I hate that song.

59:19.320 --> 59:20.320
I can only imagine.

59:20.320 --> 59:23.320
Well, War Game on 7Q was never a big problem for me.

59:23.320 --> 59:26.320
For some reason, scratching, I'm like, I'm okay with it.

59:26.320 --> 59:31.800
okay with it. Checking you out was the second 7 star I ever beat, and now I understand it's

59:31.800 --> 59:37.120
an 8 star. So like, I beat an 8 star, like, when I was beating my first 7 star. That is

59:37.120 --> 59:42.160
so crazy to me. But for some reason, scratching has never bothered me. After you play a hundred

59:42.160 --> 59:51.360
songs with random, just hold the key 2, and then wait for the random to go red. And that's

59:51.360 --> 59:54.880
how it works. Yeah, that's how it works. So, those of you guys that are feeling a little

59:54.880 --> 01:00:00.640
crazy and want to play some random with the turntable. There you have it. What would you

01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:05.440
say would be your favorite new video in 2DX8 style? I haven't seen all of them because

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:13.560
I'm really busy playing 7T songs. I like Nebula Grasp for a lot. Nebula Grasp has got a pretty

01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:17.640
good video too. It's one of those futuristic, typical kind of things. It kind of reminded

01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:22.440
me of Hyperboundary 8 a little bit. That was an LED song too and it had all the futuristic

01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:26.120
the graphics with it. Kind of reminded me of that a little bit. And I bought a 2DX

01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:32.680
Red Style. I really like Spiral Galaxy as well. Were you able to get the V-Rare when

01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:40.480
you got? Oh, no, no, I didn't. Just a regular one I ordered. Oh, okay. Alright. Well, anything

01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:45.400
else you want to share about 2DX A-Style? Well, nothing much else. Alright. Well, we'll

01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:50.360
talk to you later then, I guess. Have a good one, Ziggy. Alright, later. Later! I like

01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:55.080
getting phone calls. That was fun. Alright. People say in our chat room right now, they

01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:58.160
said, they're talking about 2DX too much. Well, it is the news that's going on right

01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:02.400
now, you know, you guys, but fine. We're going to talk about a little bit of DDR. We're going

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:08.280
to try and get the, I Feel, the new remix for you. Look, he's going to get that taken

01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:11.960
care of during the next break, right? Yes. Good. Then I guess we're going to go to a

01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:15.560
break so we can get that song. We're going to hear some music from DDR Festival, some

01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:22.000
more music? Yes, Jamie? What? Thank you. We'll do the second mix break in a bit, but I want

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:25.700
to get the festival stuff taken care of first. Yes, I did threaten the chat room with some

01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:30.640
butterfly and I know that's first mix, but I want to get that in there too, at some point.

01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:36.240
So let's see what you can do. But in this break, a different version of Udoru, I can't

01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:44.240
even say this, you know the Captain Jack song from fifth mix? Udoru. Yeah, that song. There's

01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:47.240
I can do a version of it in festival so we're gonna hear this I haven't heard

01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:51.120
this one yet so I got to check this out a remix of I need you which was a song

01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:56.960
that was kind of a in the DDR max 2 USA but we'll hear it see if it's any better

01:01:56.960 --> 01:02:04.080
here's the thing about I need you and it wasn't in well yeah max you say this was

01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:08.440
the one that was on the V rare for the last mix all right that wasn't too bad

01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:10.560
all right so we'll check it out we're gonna check out these songs and we'll be

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:13.360
back and we're gonna talk a little bit more about Ultramix to some of the news

01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:16.840
there and play that new song from Ultramix 2. And of course the cage match, FUs of the

01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:22.160
Week, all that good stuff coming up. And in the chat room they're saying, look, since

01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:28.160
you're so white, Sky, just say dancing pom-pom-colin. And even that I can't say right. I just, I

01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:35.160
cut out for radio, what can I say? We'll be back.

01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:00.160
I don't know what I'm gonna do

01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:02.160
Eki no naka

01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:34.160
Believe, believe, believe

01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:39.160
The promise of love for the happy one

01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:43.160
All your thoughts won't wait until I'm with you

01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:47.160
No, it's not a way to step on the line

01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:50.160
Don't judge my way, don't you

01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:53.160
I need you, need you

01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:57.160
And you ain't gonna tell me none more

01:06:57.160 --> 01:06:59.140
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:01.620
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:07:01.940 --> 01:07:03.880
Hey, hey, hey!

01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:07.180
Hey! Hey! Hey!

01:07:13.900 --> 01:07:16.300
Gaming radio, so uncensored

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.360
That even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us

01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:21.080
Uh, Moch-

01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:22.400
brake, isn't hard

01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:24.400
Orange Lounge Radio

01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:35.000
God bless you Tom Brokaw. You know he finally retired. He did? Yeah. This is the last we

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:40.200
had time. One of the most highly rated episodes of the show of all time or something like

01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:45.280
that. I don't know. Something like that. Crazy. Anyway, we are going to be playing the new

01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:50.680
I Feel remix. We just, we ripped it during the break there. Loki, our tech massa is working

01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:54.120
on it right now trying to get it all perfect. I said we should just rip it out

01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:58.820
of edit mode but apparently if you try to rip it in edit mode it cuts off the

01:07:58.820 --> 01:08:02.160
very beginning little speech thing because it starts off as do you feel it

01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:04.640
like it sounds like one of those like speaking spells or something saying it

01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:09.960
and Loki was like no we can't have that so he made us go back and do it in edit

01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:13.760
mode so whatever that's fine at least we'll have it we can put it in rotation

01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:16.840
on our bimani musical more program which airs 24 hours a day seven days a week on

01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:20.420
this station when we're not here also speaking of live programming Monday

01:08:45.580 --> 01:08:49.900

the way was on last Friday and of course Loki won was there any surprise in

01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:53.560
anyone's mind I don't think so moving right along I got to plug the live

01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:57.420
journal community because we haven't plugged that in a while if you guys have

01:09:57.420 --> 01:10:00.040
a live journal which I know a lot of you do in this day and age we're starting to

01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:03.680
move into a live journal a centered internet I head on over to our live

01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:06.960
journal community it's just username orange lounge on live journal and if you

01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:23.440
a way for you to meet other listeners of Horns Life Radio. Crazy people like us.

01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:28.560
Let's see DDR UltraMix 2. It's been a game we've been talking about a hell of a

01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:33.400
lot lately I gotta say but song pack I keep calling it service back song pack

01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:38.040
7 came out this week finally a lot of us were expecting the song pack 7 was going

01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:42.120
to be out when the game came out but for whatever reason there was a delay sounds

01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:45.440
like there might have been some kind of bug that prevented things I don't know a

01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:49.440
lot of people bitching and moaning because song pack 7 has a lot of old

01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:53.560
songs in it we were talking about this a little bit last week but song pack 7 has

01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:59.720
end of the century and Las Señorita and Silent Hill a lot of old classic DDR

01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:04.660
songs but I guess played out to a lot of people as well era as well so you get

01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:10.760
some tack finally and indeed your ultimate still but a lot of these these

01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:13.040
songs since they're old they're kind of played out so they're getting a lot of

01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:16.960
kind of negative feedback from folks out there even though I don't know I think

01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:21.240
it's kind of neat because a you get them 60 frames a second B you can play them

01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:26.160
on Xbox live now not that I'm a huge fan of any of the songs really I like era

01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:31.440
don't get me wrong I love era but then there's this new remix of I feel the

01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:34.480
junk circuit mix which is pretty interesting because junk circuit is

01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:37.920
another artist that's over on a different drum the background for this

01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:41.840
song has like the website address you may have noticed a lot of the different

01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:46.660
drum songs a lot of those like the Jesper kid a lot of the a lot of the new

01:11:46.660 --> 01:11:49.040
songs ultra mix to have websites in their background so it's kind of

01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:53.440
interesting that we're getting those in some of the song packs as well but I

01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:58.240
think in visiting junk circuits website I think there's actually a lot in common

01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:03.280
between junk circuit and Naropa who does the song standing still in time because

01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:09.120
they have the same website contact email so kind of interesting all right anyway

01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:12.720
they're telling us in the chat room to stop talking about the song and play the

01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:15.880
damn thing already that's fine we'll get to it I'm going to copy it over right

01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:19.920
now monkeys put the finishing touches on it so we'll go ahead and play that for

01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:22.920
But really first, Loki, what did you think of this remix?

01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:24.920
It's better than the other one.

01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:26.920
You didn't like the other one? Why is that?

01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:30.920
The other one just kind of sucked. I don't know. It was just kind of, eh, not much different.

01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:32.920
This is a lot better.

01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:37.920
I do like this one a little bit better too, but I kind of like the old one as well, I got to admit.

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:39.920
So, I don't know. What do I know?

01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:47.920
Alright. I got to copy it over.

01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:50.920
I guess there was a big tournament on Ultramix 2 tonight, online.

01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:54.920
There was a lot of people talking about it over on DDRFreak, I missed it.

01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:59.920
It wasn't something, I knew I'd get my ass kicked so I didn't want to participate, but I guess it went pretty well, from what I hear.

01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:03.920
Alright, I'll stop talking and start playing. Here it is!

01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:08.920
Orange Launch Radio presents the brand new iFeel remix, it's the junk circuit mix. Enjoy you guys.

01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:10.920
Do you feel it?

01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:47.920
I sit here, I sit here.

01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:59.920
I sit here, I sit here.

01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:06.920
I sit here, I sit here.

01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:24.920
Can you hear it?

01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:34.920
Can you hear it?

01:14:34.920 --> 01:15:03.680
There it is, brand new here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:07.680
I feel the junk circuit mix. What did you guys think of that? Some of you guys are hearing

01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:13.080
that for the first time. Dark Sakura? Who did that again? That was junk circuit. I like

01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:17.400
the original better. I think a lot of us can agree that the original is a little bit better.

01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:21.440
Nothing ever tops the original. It's like when you remake old movies. Oh, Loki says

01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:26.520
it does top the original. Well, I disagree. Nothing tops the Kiryamoga. What did you think

01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:31.400
of that, Bradley? I liked it, except I think that the, I feel that little. Hold the bottom

01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:06.480
Except for I think that that little computer I feel it voice is a bad touch

01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:10.800
If they left it out and make it better jazz in our Chatham agrees with you

01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:15.400
He says the whole can you feel it samples just sounds fucking cheesy is what he says yeah

01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:18.040
And Jamie's yelling from the laundry room that she agrees

01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:22.240
Yeah, no overall. I like it. Yeah. I I think it's pretty good

01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:28.820
I I think the can you feel it is a little weird, but it I don't know it's it's different

01:16:28.820 --> 01:16:33.820
I give him points for trying. It's a good remix. It's a fun song to play.

01:16:33.820 --> 01:16:36.820
The steps are kind of interesting.

01:16:36.820 --> 01:16:38.820
It took something good and added a bunch of extremist crap to it.

01:16:38.820 --> 01:16:43.820
The steps. Is there any DDR remix that you've liked so far?

01:16:43.820 --> 01:16:48.820
I like the What's His Face one that you interviewed last week.

01:16:48.820 --> 01:16:49.820
Midihead?

01:16:49.820 --> 01:16:50.820
Yeah.

01:16:50.820 --> 01:16:51.820
Okay.

01:16:51.820 --> 01:16:52.820
Oh, that's good.

01:16:52.820 --> 01:16:54.820
Alright. Yeah, What's His Face.

01:16:54.820 --> 01:16:57.820
I wasn't here.

01:16:57.820 --> 01:17:04.440
I wasn't here. I know it. You'll get to talk to the next DDRi. We're hoping we have Midi

01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:09.020
Head back at some point, actually. But actually, if you guys missed it, I know that right now

01:17:09.020 --> 01:17:14.960
he's going to, he agreed to do an interview with DDRFreak, so if you go on to the game

01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:20.100
console games, what is that, DDR console games forum, there's a little sticky announcement

01:17:20.100 --> 01:17:24.100
thingy where you can ask Midi Head a question. So if you missed getting your question last

01:17:24.100 --> 01:17:26.700
week, because we took some questions from our listeners, but if you missed your chance

01:17:26.700 --> 01:17:31.180
asked me to hit a question. They are taking question submissions right now, so go check

01:17:31.180 --> 01:17:35.080
that out if you like. What did you think of that remix, Angel? You like everything, so

01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:38.580
I know you're going to have something good to say about it.

01:17:38.580 --> 01:17:45.100
Well, I liked the first one from Silent Hill when we first did that one. That one, when

01:17:45.100 --> 01:17:47.660
the other one came out, I liked that one. So, what do you think my answer is going to

01:17:47.660 --> 01:17:55.460
be this time? Come on. What do you think? Ten? Yeah. You're such a Bomani whore. I love

01:17:55.460 --> 01:17:56.460
it.

01:17:56.460 --> 01:18:10.820
I want to take some calls on the Skype line.

01:18:10.820 --> 01:18:15.580
If you want to give us a call, head on over to www.orangelandradio.com and click on interact

01:18:15.580 --> 01:18:16.580
with us.

01:18:16.580 --> 01:18:19.860
I'm kind of curious about some of your guys' feedback on UltraMix 2, specifically Song

01:18:19.860 --> 01:18:22.400
Pack 7 if you've had a chance to check it out.

01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:26.040
Any online experiences you might have had on Ultramix 2, and even if you want to talk

01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:29.540
about a DDR festival, because we haven't talked a whole lot about DDR festival and that's

01:18:29.540 --> 01:18:33.400
just because none of us in Sacr- I don't think a single person in Sacramento that I know

01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:38.320
of anyway has bought the game, so we don't know what to say about it.

01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:43.160
And to add to that, if you'd like to talk about Drawn Together as well, no, that's not-

01:18:43.160 --> 01:19:10.160
The house has been rearranged in Halo 2 land position.

01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:14.560
I have no room to put any dance pads or anything.

01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:15.560
Look at this place.

01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:16.560
Hello.

01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:17.560
You can sit on our dance.

01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:18.560
You have infinitely more room.

01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:19.560
Dance got the...

01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:26.080
Normally in my living room we have the TV on one wall, the couch on one wall, and the

01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:28.240
loveseat back on the far wall.

01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:33.600
Now the loveseat and couch are back to back with just enough room to have a place to put

01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:36.680
your legs in an Xbox between TVs.

01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:38.840
It is currently in LAN mode.

01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:42.080
Are you guys hosting a bunch of Halo 2 parties or something?

01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:44.000
Dan did on his birthday on Monday.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:45.200
Oh, his birthday was Monday, huh?

01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:46.200
Yeah.

01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:47.200
Happy birthday, Dan.

01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:48.200
I wasn't here for that.

01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:49.200
Oh.

01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:51.200
He told me I should feel guilty.

01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:55.200
Oh, now that's not true.

01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:57.200
That's not true.

01:19:57.200 --> 01:20:02.080
Well, I don't think anybody's calling us on the Skyline, so what can we do?

01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:03.400
Dan, I think so.

01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:07.080
Except now they're talking about drawing together in our chat room.

01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:14.500
freaking ass, Loki. Jerk. Loki, now you keep telling me that you're going to start playing

01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:18.100
UltraMix 2, because I notice that every time I've been playing it, you're like, yeah, I

01:20:18.100 --> 01:20:22.700
need to play that. Yeah, I need to play that. Are you actually going to be playing? Oh,

01:20:22.700 --> 01:20:27.420
we're finally getting a call. You're on, you get a reprieve for now, but as soon as this

01:20:27.420 --> 01:20:30.600
call's done, we're going to ask you about that. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:34.520
Legend Zaku here. Hi Zaku, how are you?

01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:38.000
Well, I don't have that much to share because, you know,

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:41.360
as I said, you know, I'm a college student. Then get off the phone!

01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:45.840
No, I'm kidding. I don't have a PS2 or an Xbox. I might get one this Christmas, but I'm kinda

01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:49.600
iffy on which one should I get. You know, Bamani-wise, that is.

01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:54.520
So you don't have a PS2 or an Xbox. You're asking the age-old question, which

01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:55.640
system should I get?

01:20:55.640 --> 01:20:59.360
No, but in regards to not only, you know, games, but also Bamani

01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:03.360
as well. I'm adding a little kick to it.

01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:06.360
And you have nothing to add about drawn together.

01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:07.360
He didn't hear that one.

01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:09.360
And you have nothing to add about drawn together.

01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:12.360
I did see South Park last Wednesday, but that was about it.

01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:16.360
No, no, no. Quit trying to derail this program, Loki, Zaku, Shane.

01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:22.360
All right. As far as Xbox versus PS2, here it is basically.

01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:27.360
If you're interested in something that's going to remind you of the arcade,

01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:30.720
gonna bring you the arcade experience to the home something where there's a lot

01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:34.520
of different songs available something with itoy support if you want to get

01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:39.120
your hands involved go for the ps2 if you want to get something where you can

01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:43.400
play online and you want to play against other people that live around go for the

01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:46.800
Xbox but here's the thing you being the starving college student that means

01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:49.520
you're gonna have to pay for the Xbox Xbox Live and then five bucks a song

01:21:49.520 --> 01:21:55.480
pack so I don't know what what are you looking at also with the ps2 I might

01:21:55.480 --> 01:21:59.740
I have to mod it. I have to mod it if I'm going to play 2DX or any of those lovely but

01:21:59.740 --> 01:22:01.300
modded games besides CD-R.

01:22:01.300 --> 01:22:04.900
Well, that's very true, and then that's going to cost you money as well. I mean, if you

01:22:04.900 --> 01:22:08.740
want to play the Japanese game. And that's the other thing. If you plan on modding your

01:22:08.740 --> 01:22:14.060
PS2, which, you know, can have mixed results, I guess I hear now it's a pretty easy mod.

01:22:14.060 --> 01:22:18.300
I live in the city. I live in the city. Chinatown's not that far, and I can always get it modded

01:22:18.300 --> 01:22:19.300
there.

01:22:19.300 --> 01:22:21.660
Alright, alright. Fair enough. So you can get a modded PS2. So if you're interested

01:22:21.660 --> 01:22:25.220
in 2DX or Poppin' or any of that stuff, you're definitely going to want to get the PS2.

01:22:25.220 --> 01:22:34.220
Here's the other thing to consider, too. We have PS3 and Xbox2 likely to be out in stores before next Christmas.

01:22:34.220 --> 01:22:39.220
We don't know for sure, but if I were a betting man, I would say those things are going to be in stores next Christmas,

01:22:39.220 --> 01:22:46.220
which means the systems that are out there now, their prices will be halved, or they'll be $100 or less.

01:22:46.220 --> 01:22:54.220
Yeah, I probably already took notice of that, and I think 9th Style, if it does come out next year for PS2,

01:22:54.220 --> 01:22:58.940
I don't know if it's going to jump into the next console or just be the last PS2 2DX game.

01:22:58.940 --> 01:23:03.900
I'm kind of hoping that there is a 9th style and a 10th style pretty back-to-back.

01:23:03.900 --> 01:23:06.420
I'm kind of hoping that those games come out pretty quickly.

01:23:06.420 --> 01:23:10.460
PS2 or just one for PS2 and the next for PS3.

01:23:10.460 --> 01:23:12.220
I hope they both come out.

01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:19.900
I think it's a given that PS3 will play PS2 games, so they ought to just both come out for PS2.

01:23:19.900 --> 01:23:28.900
Yeah, seeing as, you know, I already noticed that 2DX games come out, you know, there's always 2DX games coming out for PS2 every single year.

01:23:28.900 --> 01:23:36.900
And basically, from what I'm speculating, from what I'm predicting, 9th Style might come out in May next year or something, or near the summer.

01:23:36.900 --> 01:23:38.900
Who knows? Nobody really knows.

01:23:38.900 --> 01:23:39.900
I'm taking a guess here.

01:23:39.900 --> 01:23:40.900
Yeah, you're taking a shot.

01:23:40.900 --> 01:23:42.900
I'm taking an educated guess from...

01:23:42.900 --> 01:23:46.900
But, you know, alright, I think pretty much I...

01:23:46.900 --> 01:23:53.900
You know what? Then again, 9th style would make a lot of sense on Playstation 3, because then they could fuck up the timing.

01:23:53.900 --> 01:23:56.900
Try putting it on a new system, just like the arcade ones.

01:23:56.900 --> 01:24:07.900
And if I get a PS2 for Bomani, I'm going to have to pay money for the 2DX controller, Pop'n Music, so that's going to be equally the same if I'm going to try going after both.

01:24:07.900 --> 01:24:14.900
Because one will have more peripherals, and the other will have more services and things to buy.

01:24:14.900 --> 01:24:19.220
Now, also to even confuse things even more, there's also the Phantom console that's coming

01:24:19.220 --> 01:24:26.500
out and, um, the, how is that confusing? Who gives a shit about the Phantom? Seriously?

01:24:26.500 --> 01:24:32.540
What the, what's that? Exactly, exactly. Hey, I've got pictures of the drill on orange

01:24:32.540 --> 01:24:38.420
on radio dot com. And I hear rumors, I hear rumors of the, um, N-Gage 2 that's shaped

01:24:38.420 --> 01:24:50.420
like a banana. I have rumors of a foul movement I'm about to have after this show. Here's

01:24:50.420 --> 01:24:53.380
the thing though, if you're looking for a Bomani, a system for a Bomani, don't get a

01:24:53.380 --> 01:24:59.780
GameCube. Of course not, hell no. GameCubes are not worth the money. Hey, don't you be

01:24:59.780 --> 01:25:04.260
knocking the GameCube, it's a beautiful system. I'm not knocking them. I mean, it's cheap,

01:25:04.260 --> 01:25:07.380
but I mean, there's no Bomani. Don't make me come out there and cut you, because I will.

01:25:07.380 --> 01:25:12.460
What, you're going to travel 3,000 miles? To cut you? To cut you, yes.

01:25:12.460 --> 01:25:16.860
Do you even know where in New York do I live? I'll send my minions.

01:25:16.860 --> 01:25:18.320
Yeah, sure.

01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:21.440
And then do you want a cookie for that guy?

01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:22.700
We can track your IP!

01:25:22.700 --> 01:25:23.640
That's right.

01:25:23.640 --> 01:25:28.000
Yeah. Live 365 has it all on record, I think.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:31.520
Sure it does. What IP and what school am I going...

01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:36.380
Am I doing this properly? You're going to the school of hang up in about five seconds there, buddy.

01:25:36.380 --> 01:25:37.880
Thanks a lot, thanks a lot, Sky.

01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:38.880
Alright, you're welcome.

01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:39.880
Now I know what to...

01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:40.880
Take care, Zaku.

01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:41.880
Yeah, alright.

01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:42.880
Bye.

01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:48.880
Now I know what to choose later.

01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:53.560
Zaku's always fun to talk to.

01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:55.440
I like bullying him a little bit.

01:25:55.440 --> 01:25:56.440
He's fun.

01:25:56.440 --> 01:25:57.440
He's a fun guy.

01:25:57.440 --> 01:25:58.440
Alright.

01:25:58.440 --> 01:25:59.720
We're gonna go do the Orange Launch Radio Cage Match.

01:25:59.720 --> 01:26:04.520
We gotta get into that.

01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:11.440
week in the Orange Launch Radio cage match. Loki was the winner, but it doesn't matter

01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:16.800
because that was a one-time thing, so that gets thrown out and we go back to the cage

01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:21.160
match at hand. Our reoccurring winner, Gwen Stefani, What You Waiting For? It's a song

01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:26.080
I put in the cage match, believe it or not, three weeks ago. So because it won last week

01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:31.560
by default, this is the last time it can win. And if it wins tonight, it'll become the second

01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:35.560
We're gonna play three songs for you guys, one song from each host. We only have one song in Orange Lounge History to be retired from the Cage Match, so we'll see.

01:26:35.560 --> 01:26:39.560
Alright, we'll see. Loki seems convinced it's gonna be gone.

01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:43.560
Jamie, you have something you wanna say?

01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:47.560
Thank you. What a woman.

01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:51.560
Alright, here we go. Here's a clip of last- oh yeah, the way the Cage Match works.

01:26:51.560 --> 01:26:55.560
You gotta be in our chat room, you gotta be listening live on Sunday night.

01:26:55.560 --> 01:26:59.560
www.orangetownstrated.com, click on chat. We're gonna play three songs for you guys,

01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:01.260
One song from each host.

01:27:01.260 --> 01:27:05.320
We only play a clip of last week's winner though, because you already heard the song

01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:08.840
back when it first won, because you listen to Orange Lounge Radio every week, right?

01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:09.840
Right?

01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:14.860
Anyway, then you're going to send in your vote, and the winning song goes into rotation

01:27:14.860 --> 01:27:20.640
all week long on Orange Lounge Radio, 24-7, Balmaini Music and More program.

01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:21.640
Alright, here it is.

01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:22.640
Enough talking.

01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:24.640
A clip of song number one you can vote for tonight.

01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:26.680
Gwen Stefani, what you waiting for?

01:27:26.680 --> 01:27:30.680
Take a chance cause you might grow

01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:47.680
What you waiting, what you waiting for?

01:27:51.680 --> 01:27:54.680
Take a chance cause you might grow

01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:58.680
Looking like a fellow, you're receding yourself

01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:01.680
You know it all by heart, why are you standing in one place?

01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:05.680
A moon to blast, a moon to carry

01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:08.680
You're moving in and out cause of your search for a new zone

01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:12.680
I know it's been messed up how our society all things short

01:28:12.680 --> 01:28:16.680
Life is short, you're capable

01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:18.880
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

01:28:21.980 --> 01:28:24.680
And look at your watch now

01:28:24.680 --> 01:28:28.480
You're still a super hot female

01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:31.680
You've entered a million dollar contract

01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:34.480
And they're all waiting for your heart track

01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:39.480
Ooh, watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it

01:28:39.480 --> 01:28:40.480
Ooh

Ooh, watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it,

01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:47.480

I can't wait to go

01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:56.480
Back into Japan

01:28:56.480 --> 01:29:09.040
All right, that was song number one in tonight's cage match.

01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:12.600
Gwen Stefani with What You Waiting For, What's So Goddamn Funny?

01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:16.240
Talking about combining different groups.

01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:21.640
We've got Britney Spears and Flo and then B4U, we have B4U.

01:29:21.640 --> 01:29:24.640

You don't need to be much from nothing You don't need to step up with

01:31:46.780 --> 01:31:59.780
Feels good, looks good, sounds good, looks good, feels good too

He was good too, all that's right He was good too, all that's right

You don't need to think English on your own, you don't need to share a word You don't need

01:32:32.780 --> 01:32:37.780
The English was nothing, you don't give a shit about it

01:32:37.780 --> 01:32:39.780
You don't need me

01:32:39.780 --> 01:32:41.780
You are so nothing

You don't need to

01:33:51.060 --> 01:33:52.860
Yeah, one girl, I think

01:33:52.860 --> 01:33:54.260
You don't need to

01:33:54.260 --> 01:33:55.660
Go alone

01:33:56.060 --> 01:33:57.460
You don't need to

01:33:57.860 --> 01:33:59.460
Yeah, one girl, I think

01:33:59.460 --> 01:34:00.460
You don't need to

01:34:00.460 --> 01:34:02.260
Go alone

01:34:02.460 --> 01:34:03.860
You don't need to

01:34:03.860 --> 01:34:05.460
Yeah, one girl, I think

01:34:35.460 --> 01:34:41.860
We don't want it, we don't want nothing, we are being careful

01:35:05.460 --> 01:35:10.820
the nine for me but i don't really care an apathetic nine from dark sakura

01:35:10.820 --> 01:35:16.100
seriously i just put it in just because i wanted to listen to it that's a good enough reason as any

01:35:16.100 --> 01:35:22.820
uh arcadian see if that mic will work again for you no is it it's on there we go okay yes

01:35:23.620 --> 01:35:28.580

01:35:28.580 --> 01:35:30.580
a six from Markidian. Uh, Loki!

01:35:32.580 --> 01:35:34.580
I didn't get it.

01:35:34.580 --> 01:35:36.580
Was that supposed to be a song?

01:35:36.580 --> 01:35:40.580
Because it sounded just like some stupid synth in the background and talking over it.

01:35:40.580 --> 01:35:42.580
So I don't get it.

01:35:42.580 --> 01:35:46.580
I'm trying to go- it sounds like a Beck-type thing, but no.

01:35:46.580 --> 01:35:48.580
No.

01:35:48.580 --> 01:35:51.580
I can't imagine this being actually better than the original remix.

01:35:51.580 --> 01:35:54.580
Of course I don't remember that remix of it, so um...

01:35:54.580 --> 01:36:00.820
I get the one sorry I you know what I actually dig the sense in that song

01:36:00.820 --> 01:36:04.300
quite a bit it's I see that it's kind of like maybe a song I would listen to all

01:36:04.300 --> 01:36:07.700
I'm driving home late at night it's pretty cool and it's got a very much of

01:36:07.700 --> 01:36:11.780
an 80s vibe going for me my only complaint is that the little quiet I'd

01:36:11.780 --> 01:36:15.660
like something maybe a little bit more driving but I actually like to say I

01:36:15.660 --> 01:36:19.060
like I've become a total synth pop horror lately and yes a lot of that has

01:36:19.060 --> 01:36:22.360
to do with ultra mix too so that song kind of fits in for me so I'm giving it

01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:32.360
at 8. Angel? I liked it a lot, I'll give it an 8. Alright, remember it doesn't matter

01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:37.240
what we think though, it's all up to you guys. But you get a third song to pick from tonight,

01:36:37.240 --> 01:36:42.360
and Loki is being cheap tonight, let's hear what he's going to pick. Thank you for the

01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:48.520
introduction. Now this song, as we already heard, it was last week, we played it. This

01:36:48.520 --> 01:36:56.520
This is their cover of The Fix, Midi Head, with Deeper and Deeper, or Monolithic, whatever.

01:36:56.520 --> 01:36:58.520
Actually, it's Monolithic, but yeah.

01:36:58.520 --> 01:37:00.520
Alright, so here it is, song number three tonight.

01:37:00.520 --> 01:37:07.520
a cover of The Fix with Monolithic with Deeper and Deeper. Enjoy, we'll be back.

01:37:30.520 --> 01:37:58.520
I'm talkin' about skill in the tomb, no I don't

01:37:58.520 --> 01:38:02.520
I'm talkin' about, screw the show, when they're all letting go

01:38:02.520 --> 01:38:06.520
Take a look at the wits, see the touch on her eyes, tell me what does she feel

01:38:06.520 --> 01:38:10.520
This is the way of the world, let's take a look at the girls, show them how it looks real

01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:14.520
And I see the edge, I look, I fall

01:38:14.520 --> 01:38:19.520
I get deeper, and deeper

01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:21.520
The more I see, the more I fall

01:38:21.520 --> 01:38:26.520
Nobody finds me when I take the call, I get deeper, and deeper

01:38:56.520 --> 01:38:59.520
Once I see me, hey, hey, I'm a-gonna take a picture

01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:03.040
Can I see the edge? I look out for

01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:07.520
Like it's deeper, it's deeper

01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:09.520
The more I see, the more I fall

01:39:09.520 --> 01:39:11.280
The way time can really save the call

01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:15.520
I get deeper, it's deeper

01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:21.520
Ah, ah, ah, ah, I see the edge, I look out for

01:39:21.520 --> 01:39:23.520
The place to hide, better take a call

01:39:23.520 --> 01:39:25.240
I see the edge

01:39:25.240 --> 01:39:27.240
I see the end of the world

01:39:27.240 --> 01:39:29.240
I don't see the end

01:39:29.240 --> 01:39:31.240
It's time to go take it all

01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:41.240
This is the way of the world

01:39:41.240 --> 01:39:43.240
Deep Earth

01:39:47.240 --> 01:39:49.240
This is the way of the world

01:39:49.240 --> 01:39:51.240
Deep Earth

01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:53.240
When they're already gone

01:40:23.240 --> 01:40:30.240
I'm talking about the scale of the show, no I don't

01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:37.240
I'm talking about the scale of the show, when they're all letting go

01:40:37.240 --> 01:40:44.240
Take a look at the wind, see the smoke in her eyes, tell me what is it real

01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:49.240
Is this the way of the world, is it a boy or a girl, is it all a lie or a thrill

01:40:49.240 --> 01:41:03.920
And I see the edge, I look, I fall, I get deeper, and deeper, the more I see, the more

01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:18.920
I fall, the later I see, when I take the call, I get deeper, and deeper, I see the edge,

01:41:18.920 --> 01:41:20.920
Foul

01:41:20.920 --> 01:41:22.920
There's no place to hide

01:41:22.920 --> 01:41:48.600
I can't make a reference, Jamie what did you think?

01:41:48.600 --> 01:41:52.600
I liked everything about the song except for the guy's voice.

01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:56.600
So it gets, uh...

01:41:56.600 --> 01:42:00.600
Well, damn, the music gets a ten, the voice gets a one.

01:42:00.600 --> 01:42:04.600
So...

01:42:04.600 --> 01:42:08.600
Loki says it gets an eleven.

01:42:08.600 --> 01:42:12.600
Seven. Only because of the voice.

01:42:12.600 --> 01:42:16.600
Can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you.

01:42:16.600 --> 01:42:25.120
a nine from Bradley Loki it gets a 10 and if you like this go to MIDI head

01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:29.080
calm by his album and then tell them that orange laundry you sent you you'll

01:42:29.080 --> 01:42:34.000
get access to this wonderful song as well as many other remixes he's done I

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:39.600
should listen to that song quite a bit on my new iPod lately so I I have to

01:42:39.600 --> 01:42:45.100
miss it's actually a really good song I just hope we don't he doesn't turn into

01:42:45.100 --> 01:42:51.300
the new echo image on this station seriously no but actually it's a great

01:42:51.300 --> 01:42:58.600
song it's a great cover and I like it nine angel I like it all right good

01:42:58.600 --> 01:43:08.240
cover all right an explicit who just walked in doesn't get to focus in here

01:43:08.240 --> 01:43:13.660
that song all right all right guys you're gonna place your vote momentarily

01:43:13.660 --> 01:43:17.860
But first, here is a recap of the three songs you can vote for tonight.

And we will see what happens.

01:44:19.880 --> 01:44:24.000
Alright moving right along.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:28.680
I've been perusing some of the message forums out there lately, DDRfreak namely being one

01:44:28.680 --> 01:44:29.680
of them.

01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:32.920
I thought there was this very interesting thread over there in Random Chat.

01:44:32.920 --> 01:44:36.080
You know how they do a lot of like really crazy stuff over in Random Chat?

01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:37.960
You know the Random Chat stuff, right?

01:44:37.960 --> 01:44:39.460
Right, DarkSakura?

01:44:39.460 --> 01:44:42.460
Being a mod over there and everything?

01:44:42.460 --> 01:44:43.460
Yes.

01:44:43.460 --> 01:44:45.960
What's this random that you talk about?

01:44:45.960 --> 01:44:49.000
We don't know anything about random on this show.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:53.960
Just out of curiosity, this is total tangent, but since I'm thinking DarkSakura here in

01:44:53.960 --> 01:44:58.880
how much she loves to lock topics over there. What would you say would be the most favorite

01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:09.520
topic you've gotten to lock on Random Chat? Hi, please lock this. Yes, I've had a please

01:45:09.520 --> 01:45:18.240
lock this before. Hi, please lock this. Alright. There's an interesting topic going on there

01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:22.340
in Random Chat. It's called, do you actually play DDR anymore? And I thought it was kind

01:45:22.340 --> 01:45:27.740
of interesting, just seeing how many people actually don't play DDR anymore. So I kind

01:45:27.740 --> 01:45:33.580
of was going to go around the room a little bit and see, do you play DDR anymore? And

01:45:33.580 --> 01:45:40.660
if not, why are you doing this show? Because I have a creative, I'll start. Do I play DDR

01:45:40.660 --> 01:45:44.480
anymore? A little bit, not as much nearly as I used to. I play a little bit of Ultra

01:45:44.480 --> 01:45:50.260
Mix 2 at home. Most of my DDR playing is controller controller. The reason why I don't play DDR

01:45:50.260 --> 01:45:54.620
much anymore is because the quality of arcades in this area went downhill significantly.

01:45:54.620 --> 01:45:58.660
Konami of Japan can suck it for not putting out a new mix in a long time, I think that

01:45:58.660 --> 01:46:04.100
has a lot to do with the reason why I haven't played DDR in a long time. The home versions

01:46:04.100 --> 01:46:09.140
are the only thing keeping it alive to me, but I just can't motivate my fat ass to pull

01:46:09.140 --> 01:46:13.140
out the ignition pad, especially when the ignition pad, as good of a dance pad as it

01:46:13.140 --> 01:46:19.180
is, it's still not the arcade. I want to play DDR in the arcade, and there's no good arcade

01:46:19.180 --> 01:46:23.780
and yes I realized there was that step mania thing but to me it's it's still

01:46:23.780 --> 01:46:28.820
only 90% and it and it the damn thing broke in a week anyway and it's still

01:46:28.820 --> 01:46:36.500
not everything that DDR is it still got issues and in the groove it's okay but

01:46:36.500 --> 01:46:43.620
yeah just you know ego killed the video game star I guess uh Dark Sakura do you

01:46:43.620 --> 01:46:49.540
play DDR anymore? I played DDR when I was in Alabama. Well, there you go. Do you play

01:46:49.540 --> 01:46:54.740
it regularly besides that? When I'm somewhere that has a machine, I'll play. I've got more

01:46:54.740 --> 01:47:00.260
reason to play now than I go play Doc at RVGL. Thus, I'd add a little bit of money and go

01:47:00.260 --> 01:47:04.580
play some DDR. I played like one game of DDR when I went to go play Doc at Derby Owners

01:47:04.580 --> 01:47:08.680
Club over at Rosewood Golf Land, but here's the problem. I fucking failed Breakdown. Now,

01:47:08.680 --> 01:47:11.860
you know, it's a nine-footer. It's a more difficult song at the end of the scale, but

01:47:11.860 --> 01:47:17.860
But you have to remember, I'm somebody who was playing DDR religiously for quite some time, and, you know, I...

01:47:17.860 --> 01:47:23.860
It just makes me sad how much stamina I've lost, you know?

01:47:23.860 --> 01:47:26.860
Arkadian, do you actually play DDR anymore?

01:47:26.860 --> 01:47:34.860
Not really, just mainly because my foot's been hurting, because I haven't had that much money lately.

01:47:34.860 --> 01:47:43.220
No, I might be able to go once my foot feels 100% or 90% at least, and maybe more in the future.

01:47:43.220 --> 01:47:48.300
Because it's been so long and I need to get off my fat ass and I sit around too much.

01:47:48.300 --> 01:47:50.700
And so on.

01:47:50.700 --> 01:47:53.500
Loki, do you play DDR anymore?

01:47:53.500 --> 01:47:58.020
Is DDR in Final Fantasy XI?

01:47:58.020 --> 01:47:59.860
A DICKED!

01:47:59.860 --> 01:48:04.860
Yes, I do, on StepMania. Every once in a while, I'll play it.

01:48:04.860 --> 01:48:11.860
But, yes, to answer your question earlier about you, you know, Xbox and stuff, and if I was ever going to play it,

01:48:11.860 --> 01:48:15.860
no, because I'm going to actually set up my StepMania cabinet to be playing this stuff.

01:48:15.860 --> 01:48:21.860
In fact, that's why I bought crap today to cut the other control panel for the actual, you know, select arrows and stuff.

01:48:21.860 --> 01:48:26.860
That's why I was going to do that today. I'm hopefully going to build that this week,

01:48:26.860 --> 01:48:33.860
a while back, a new, um, IPAC thing to hook it all up, and I have to see if it's gonna get fried as easy as the other one.

01:48:33.860 --> 01:48:38.860
So, it's all on, uh, contingent on that, whether I get to play it some more.

01:48:38.860 --> 01:48:48.860
And I'm playing the arcade, cause the arcade's too far away, takes too much of my time, cuts into my Final Fantasy XI time, and, um, the arcade's broken all the time.

01:48:48.860 --> 01:48:54.860
I'm not in a way fucking out of shape. I go and play, like, a seven-footer on doubles, and I'm ready to die.

01:48:54.860 --> 01:49:01.020
die. I mean, whatever happened to me? That's what I want to know. It never used to be this

01:49:01.020 --> 01:49:05.900
hard. But once I get back in shape, yeah, I play a lot more. I just need to finish my

01:49:05.900 --> 01:49:13.380
arcade cabinet before I move out of here, so that's priority one.

01:49:13.380 --> 01:49:19.080
You don't play a whole lot of DDR in the arcade or at home anymore, yet you're very gung-ho

01:49:19.080 --> 01:49:24.200
about this cabinet and everything. Why do you think that is? Is it just a love for the

01:49:24.200 --> 01:49:29.420
basic concept of the game or? I like building stuff, have you noticed? Stuff that doesn't

01:49:29.420 --> 01:49:35.780
work. Like the portal to hell. For example, the portal to hell. Also I noticed you tend

01:49:35.780 --> 01:49:40.220
to build things halfway through and don't finish them. Such as these lovely metal pads

01:49:40.220 --> 01:49:45.380
that have been sitting over here for the past. The pads are done. Can we play Xbox or PS2

01:49:45.380 --> 01:49:51.420
games with them right now? We can if I hooked up the other, the umm, I pack thing because

01:49:51.420 --> 01:49:54.780
all I have to do is switch out the old iPack and it plugs right in and it works. But the

01:49:54.780 --> 01:50:01.420
thing is, the thing is I haven't bought the adapter for the Xbox or the PS2 yet because

01:50:01.420 --> 01:50:07.580
it was hooked up directly to my computer. But yes I could. I could if I wanted to. It

01:50:07.580 --> 01:50:12.220
just would take a while because I'd have to wire everything. But it's just that those

01:50:12.220 --> 01:50:16.820
things, I would be curious how thick the layer of dust is on those metal pads that are sitting

01:50:16.820 --> 01:50:23.600
right there. Can I go, can I go wipe my finger on it and see how much dust is on them? Here

01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:36.600
you go, Loki. They also buy the air intake, just so you know. Oh yeah, okay, I have an

01:50:36.600 --> 01:50:41.560
idea. Let me wipe the dust off of my little, my computer desk here, because I get quite

01:50:41.560 --> 01:50:45.920
a bit used to that. Oh look, it's gray. Let me wipe the dust off of every, there's dust

01:50:45.920 --> 01:50:51.380
anywhere in here. It's not a surprise that there's dust on those. That and they're right

01:50:51.380 --> 01:50:56.060
next to the air intake, which I'm sure is not good for the air conditioner one bit,

01:50:56.060 --> 01:51:01.200
but that's all right. No wonder it smells like wood in this house all the time, this

01:51:01.200 --> 01:51:06.500
strange mix of metal and everything. All right, explicit. Welcome to the show, by the way.

01:51:06.500 --> 01:51:09.780
I noticed you just ran in there. Put down the DS for a minute. Quit chatting with Angel

01:51:09.780 --> 01:51:13.740
pick a chat for a minute all right that Mike's been giving us yeah they are like

01:51:13.740 --> 01:51:20.100
what eight feet what the hell this is what I think we're exchanging special

01:51:20.100 --> 01:51:27.100
pictures this is wrong people you need to talk talk to talk II just like you

01:51:27.100 --> 01:51:32.300
know the people I am in each other when they're sitting in a cafe talk they're

01:51:32.300 --> 01:51:37.620
they're riding a penis back and forth to each other no Rob that's you last night

01:51:37.620 --> 01:51:38.620
Thank you.

01:51:38.620 --> 01:51:39.620
Thank you.

01:51:39.620 --> 01:51:42.300
You got to hold the mic at the bottom, because it's going out tonight.

01:51:42.300 --> 01:51:43.300
That mic's on its last legs.

01:51:43.300 --> 01:51:44.300
Can you hear me now?

01:51:44.300 --> 01:51:45.300
Yes, I can hear you now.

01:51:45.300 --> 01:51:46.300
Do you play DDR?

01:51:46.300 --> 01:51:48.300
Well, since there's been tournaments and stuff, and some new people want me to come back again,

01:51:48.300 --> 01:51:49.300
I guess I'll play again.

01:51:49.300 --> 01:51:50.300
Well, even though the DDR scene is dying in a way, because there hasn't been any releases

01:51:50.300 --> 01:51:51.300
for the arcades and stuff, I just totally understand the world.

01:51:51.300 --> 01:51:52.300
But it's just the new people, the community, the new members are just trying to get released

01:51:52.300 --> 01:52:01.300
Well even though the DDR scene is dying in a way, because there has been any releases for the arcades and stuff, you just totally understand the world.

01:52:01.300 --> 01:52:08.300
But it's just the new people, the community, the new members are just trying to get, bringing it back again in a way.

01:52:08.300 --> 01:52:12.300
You give me $100,000, I'll bring back DDR. I'm telling you.

01:52:12.300 --> 01:52:16.300
The only way you can bring back DDR is by fixing the stand-media cabinet, dammit.

01:52:16.300 --> 01:52:17.300
Damn it.

01:52:17.300 --> 01:52:18.300
Fuck that, Kevin.

01:52:18.300 --> 01:52:19.300
Give me $100,000.

01:52:19.300 --> 01:52:23.620
Hell, give me just $20,000 and I'll bring it back.

01:52:23.620 --> 01:52:24.620
Don't you think that...

01:52:24.620 --> 01:52:27.980
Now, call me crazy because it's not supposed to be DDR, quote, unquote, but don't you think

01:52:27.980 --> 01:52:30.060
In the Groove was sort of a way to try to bring DDR back?

01:52:30.060 --> 01:52:32.780
That's why I always got the impression that In the Groove was...

01:52:32.780 --> 01:52:34.980
Even though it's not DDR.

01:52:34.980 --> 01:52:39.980
Well, the thing about In the Groove is that not many cabinets have been sold around the

01:52:39.980 --> 01:52:43.260
U.S. just yet, and very few songs are in it.

01:52:43.260 --> 01:52:48.260
It's mainly just testing the waters until the groove 2 comes out and stuff.

01:52:48.260 --> 01:52:55.260
And it also depends on what step makers are they going to hire and what songs they're going to put in it.

01:52:55.260 --> 01:53:01.260
Hell, they put UltraMix in the DDR camp and I play it.

01:53:01.260 --> 01:53:04.260
The first week after UltraMix 2 is out, I put the call out on the show.

01:53:04.260 --> 01:53:08.260
I said, we need to hound the shit out of Konami of Hawaii and however it has to happen.

01:53:08.260 --> 01:53:13.500
to happen. I don't care if some arcade division went under or what the shit happened. I don't

01:53:13.500 --> 01:53:17.180
care how it has to happen. It just needs to happen. Hawaii needs to make a new arcade

01:53:17.180 --> 01:53:22.180
mix. End of story. I don't care who's gotta be blown, who's gotta be paid the money. Make

01:53:22.180 --> 01:53:27.640
it happen. You know what's hella funny though? The hella companies are saying that the whole

01:53:27.640 --> 01:53:33.500
arcade business is dying. Unless you're trying to do like this car system like Tekken 5 and

01:53:33.500 --> 01:53:35.900
or Midnight Tuner, or Initial D.

01:53:35.900 --> 01:53:38.220
Yeah, but the lines for Tekken 5? Insane.

01:53:38.220 --> 01:53:43.420
Honestly. You can't say Tekken 5 is not, I mean, despite how you feel about the Tekken series,

01:53:43.420 --> 01:53:46.580
it's, you know, the biggest crowd I've seen in an arcade in a long time.

01:53:46.580 --> 01:53:49.900
I have no clue.

01:53:49.900 --> 01:53:55.740
You know, that's just like people saying, oh, well, you know, internet's killing the telephones.

01:53:55.740 --> 01:53:58.540
People still use the telephones, just like people use the internet.

01:53:58.540 --> 01:54:01.660
Yes, people still use the telephone, and I talk to them.

01:54:01.660 --> 01:54:02.300
Sorry.

01:54:02.300 --> 01:54:28.300
The reason why I pump it up is making more and more money just building new machines and stuff.

01:54:28.300 --> 01:54:35.060
me to be the first to offer sex to anyone at Konami of Hawaii if you can make yourselves

01:54:35.060 --> 01:54:40.580
a new DDR game. You know what? Not the Konami of Japan does a bad job, so if they want to

01:54:40.580 --> 01:54:46.700
do a new mix, I'm perfectly fine with that as well. I will extend my sex offer to Konami

01:54:46.700 --> 01:54:52.020
of Tokyo as well, case said. So just make me a new DDR and I will put out. It's that

01:54:52.020 --> 01:54:56.580
simple. Anybody else care to offer their sexual favors?

01:54:56.580 --> 01:55:00.580
No favors.

01:55:00.580 --> 01:55:02.580
This is what's pissing me off. They're like,

01:55:02.580 --> 01:55:05.580
Oh, this is too expensive to license songs here in America.

01:55:05.580 --> 01:55:07.580
That's why we can't do it.

01:55:07.580 --> 01:55:11.580
Do all in-house music. You have like, what, like five different series of culprits?

01:55:11.580 --> 01:55:14.580
Or do what you've been doing for years.

01:55:14.580 --> 01:55:17.580
License the song in Japan and then let the machines come over here.

01:55:17.580 --> 01:55:20.580
That's what they've been doing for years.

01:55:20.580 --> 01:55:23.580
Because it's cheaper to license the songs in Japan, obviously.

01:55:23.580 --> 01:55:27.660
look a little weird but like I made this machine over here in Japan it's called a

01:55:27.660 --> 01:55:37.020
DDR Extreme USA but it's not meant to be played in the United States just they

01:55:37.020 --> 01:55:41.420
could call they could call it DDR shit mix and I'd still play it I'm sorry

01:55:41.420 --> 01:55:52.220
shitake they could call it DDR shitake mix I would still play it angel you

01:55:52.220 --> 01:55:55.980
still play DDR at all? You're probably more into DDR than anyone I know right now, so

01:55:55.980 --> 01:56:02.980
I have to ask you this. Oh, yeah. In fact, I'm probably gonna break down and get a dual-platform

01:56:02.980 --> 01:56:09.980
Ignition, because I want to play on Xbox Live. So, yeah, I'm looking into getting both of

01:56:10.700 --> 01:56:17.700
those this week, UltraMix 2 and NewPad, because Magus is dying anyway, so I might as well

01:56:17.700 --> 01:56:20.700
We'll just replace it, and then we can play doubles and stuff.

01:56:20.700 --> 01:56:21.700
It's cool.

01:56:21.700 --> 01:56:25.700
All right, speaking of ignition, which is better, ignition or cobalt flux?

01:56:25.700 --> 01:56:27.700
I couldn't tell you because I haven't really played enough cobalt flux.

01:56:27.700 --> 01:56:31.700
I saw it a little bit at E3, but it wasn't familiar enough with it.

01:56:31.700 --> 01:56:33.700
They're both the same fucking pad.

01:56:33.700 --> 01:56:35.700
It's the same damn thing with a different logo on it.

01:56:35.700 --> 01:56:36.700
That's all it is.

01:56:36.700 --> 01:56:37.700
You can't get much different.

01:56:37.700 --> 01:56:40.700
Oh, our metal is different than your metal.

01:56:40.700 --> 01:56:44.700
What about the quality and how many times could it be stepped?

01:56:44.700 --> 01:56:47.700
It doesn't matter, they're the fucking same.

01:56:47.700 --> 01:56:51.700
The scum of flesh says not even a rhino could beat down the pad.

01:56:51.700 --> 01:56:53.700
Oh yeah! Do they have a rhino to test this?

01:56:53.700 --> 01:56:57.700
Do they take it to Africa and go, hey rhino! Step on the pad!

01:56:57.700 --> 01:56:59.700
How do you like it? I mean, I'm sorry.

01:56:59.700 --> 01:57:03.700
Now I can say, yeah guess what? Jupiter has nothing on this pad!

01:57:03.700 --> 01:57:06.700
This pad can fuck up Jupiter!

01:57:06.700 --> 01:57:09.700
Seriously, they're just pulling the shit out of their ass, okay?

01:57:09.700 --> 01:57:11.700
A rhino can't fuck this up!

01:57:11.700 --> 01:57:17.820
oh well I guess what Bigfoot recommends you know red octane so fuck that it's

01:57:17.820 --> 01:57:22.320
stupid really to be honest when it comes down the pads don't buy off the internet

01:57:22.320 --> 01:57:26.000
buy stuff that you can see a store buy it like fries and stuff where you can

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.800
actually see these pads because the shit you get off the internet and because I

01:57:28.800 --> 01:57:34.480
have bought metal pads you know off the internet and I stepped on them and they

01:57:34.480 --> 01:57:41.400
bent they bent downwards and I was like what the fuck it was retarded pads are

01:57:41.400 --> 01:57:44.280
They're not meant to be folded in half.

01:57:44.280 --> 01:57:49.400
Well, talk about how they say SUVs can't bust them on their advertisements.

01:57:49.400 --> 01:57:53.540
Our chat room over at www.orangelaunchrader.com clicking on chat, interesting point, there

01:57:53.540 --> 01:57:59.040
already is a DDR shit mix, and it's the don't fall off mix, the DDR Extreme bootleg.

01:57:59.040 --> 01:58:00.520
You know the one that would speed up?

01:58:00.520 --> 01:58:01.520
Well, actually there's two of them.

01:58:01.520 --> 01:58:02.520
Yeah, I know about the speed up.

01:58:02.520 --> 01:58:03.520
I know about the bootleg.

01:58:03.520 --> 01:58:04.520
The one that will speed up.

01:58:04.520 --> 01:58:05.520
DDR Extreme Plus, thank you.

01:58:05.520 --> 01:58:08.520
There's the DDR Extreme, yeah, the one in Country Club Lane, speed up, ooh, let's speed

01:58:08.520 --> 01:58:16.520
Max 300 and let's see if we can beat it at 360ppm, oh wow, or hear Cartoon Heroes in

01:58:16.520 --> 01:58:17.520
a very high touch voice.

01:58:17.520 --> 01:58:21.520
You know what, this is the other thing, I want to change the topic, I want to change

01:58:21.520 --> 01:58:26.920
the topic, because this is another topic I always see on Freak, and it comes up in many

01:58:26.920 --> 01:58:29.600
different kinds of discussions, and it doesn't just come up on Freak, honestly, I've seen

01:58:29.600 --> 01:58:34.640
it even in our chatroom, I've seen it on other sites, what is the deal with Cartoon Heroes?

01:58:34.640 --> 01:58:40.580
Why do so many people freaking love that song and are quick to label a mix as utter shit

01:58:40.580 --> 01:58:42.020
if that song isn't in it?

01:58:42.020 --> 01:58:43.860
I don't understand what is so great about the song.

01:58:43.860 --> 01:58:44.860
Is it a good song?

01:58:44.860 --> 01:58:45.860
Yeah, it's a great song.

01:58:45.860 --> 01:58:47.220
It was a little better when Aqua did it.

01:58:47.220 --> 01:58:48.540
But it's a good song.

01:58:48.540 --> 01:58:49.540
Is it fun to play?

01:58:49.540 --> 01:58:50.540
Kinda.

01:58:50.540 --> 01:58:52.700
I mean, I'll die when I play it.

01:58:52.700 --> 01:58:56.340
But why do so many people freaking obsess over Cartoon Heroes?

01:58:56.340 --> 01:59:02.300
Like, do you know how many people threw a fit when that song was in Extreme USA?

01:59:02.300 --> 01:59:10.300
Let's look back in GDR history and view what we call the songs that ruin mixes.

01:59:10.300 --> 01:59:17.580
Starting with, third mix, Afronova, who could love this wonderful African chant as you jump

01:59:17.580 --> 01:59:19.580
around like a complete nut.

01:59:19.580 --> 01:59:25.820
Fourth mix, Kick the Can, with its repetitive steps over and over and over again.

01:59:25.820 --> 01:59:30.940
There's another contributing factor 1 2 3 4 0 0 7

01:59:32.860 --> 01:59:40.540
You're forgetting though my edit to kick the can aka big cans was awesome and made that song redeemable

01:59:41.980 --> 01:59:48.340
Okay, as I would continue on to fifth mix hot limits the song is just you don't understand what they're saying

01:59:48.340 --> 01:59:50.340
But you know, it's very long

01:59:50.340 --> 02:00:05.340
Anyways, um, DDR Max. I'd say probably that would be, um, Exotic Ethnic was pretty repetitive in DDR Max. Oh no, Flash in the Night. Yeah, that was another one. Flash in the Night.

02:00:05.340 --> 02:00:11.340
Hold on, your mic is still cutting out a little bit. Hold it at the bottom.

02:00:11.340 --> 02:00:18.340
A little bit. Hold it at the bottom. Yeah, try it, try it. Put it close to your mouth. There you go.

02:00:18.340 --> 02:00:24.340
That's the same reason why Cartoon Heroes got ported. That's the same reason why it's so deep it's getting ported off with DDR Max.

02:00:24.340 --> 02:00:27.340
Because it's like hard as hell 9.

02:00:27.340 --> 02:00:33.340
I would say the song that ruined DDR Max, even though I love this song, Cowgirl.

02:00:33.340 --> 02:00:40.880
Cowgirl, yes. Um, Max 2, Sagaru, and who could not forget the song that added everyone dancin'...

02:00:41.880 --> 02:00:44.200
Blow My Whistle, Bitch.

02:00:44.200 --> 02:00:45.560
Oh, God.

02:00:45.560 --> 02:00:51.680
Blow My Whistle, Bitch definitely ruined Max 2. Okay, so, make your point, please.

02:00:52.220 --> 02:00:55.500
My point is... I don't have a point. The point is that...

02:00:55.900 --> 02:00:58.540
that there's always gonna be a song that people...

02:00:58.540 --> 02:01:05.180
they're catchy and annoying catchy and to be honest i hate cartoon heroes and i know there's

02:01:05.180 --> 02:01:09.260
50 bands out there that all sound like them in fact i hear different artists i'm like is that

02:01:09.260 --> 02:01:16.380
you know aqua no it's not aqua it's um toy box or it's you know insert band here you know captain

02:01:16.380 --> 02:01:21.100
jack i mean it's they sound all the fucking same they have like the same singer that sings super

02:01:21.100 --> 02:01:24.540
high-pitched

02:01:24.540 --> 02:01:27.980
i think that it's a man who's been you know

02:01:27.980 --> 02:01:32.460
i think she's on smack that's what's going on she's on helium

02:01:32.460 --> 02:01:34.660
she's fucking taking speed she's on crack

02:01:34.660 --> 02:01:37.580
crystal meth

02:01:37.580 --> 02:01:39.780
it's awful okay

02:01:39.780 --> 02:01:44.780
there's always going to be that annoying song

02:01:44.780 --> 02:01:58.500
It's annoying when it was originally- Have you seen the video for this? The video for

02:01:58.500 --> 02:02:04.820
this is fucking annoying, okay? Honestly, it's just like, you're confusing the original-

02:02:04.820 --> 02:02:09.620
There was no video to that. You're confusing the original Aqua song, which is a little-

02:02:09.620 --> 02:02:14.320
It's a little bit slower, even though it sounds very similar. It's a little bit slower. Pretty

02:02:14.320 --> 02:02:21.240
Pretty much. Okay, take the original Cartoon Heroes by Aqua and play it on DDR Extreme

02:02:21.240 --> 02:02:25.120
Plus with the plus twenty percent modifier and that's what you get.

02:02:25.120 --> 02:02:26.120
Ah!

02:02:26.120 --> 02:02:27.120
It's awful.

02:02:27.120 --> 02:02:28.120
It's awful.

02:02:28.120 --> 02:02:29.120
It's awful.

02:02:29.120 --> 02:02:32.200
Anyways, yeah, they should have Extreme Plus Plus, which like, you know, speeds it up by

02:02:32.200 --> 02:02:33.320
a hundred percent or something like that.

02:02:33.320 --> 02:02:34.320
It's just unbelievable.

02:02:34.320 --> 02:02:35.800
A hundred percent? Okay, max six hundred.

02:02:35.800 --> 02:02:36.800
Anyways.

02:02:36.800 --> 02:02:41.720
One, two, three, four, max three hundred.

02:02:41.720 --> 02:02:48.720
Then we have songs that ruin the remix scene, but we'll do that another day.

02:02:49.800 --> 02:02:54.720
Speaking of songs that ruin DDR, I wanted to have an old-school flashback and start

02:02:54.720 --> 02:02:59.120
it off with an old favorite song of mine. Love this song. Jamie was dying to hear some

02:02:59.120 --> 02:03:02.800
Second Mix songs that are actually good songs, so we're going to put those in. So we're going

02:03:02.800 --> 02:03:05.600
to play those songs. But we have to start it off with a song I've been threatening all

02:03:05.600 --> 02:03:11.400
night long. It is the most old-school of old-school DDR songs. Please take a minute, despite how

02:03:11.400 --> 02:03:18.200
you feel about this song, this one goes out to the one and only, God bless his soul, he's

02:03:18.200 --> 02:03:24.040
not listening to us right now because he's out there, Kyle Snyder. God bless Kyle Snyder,

02:03:24.040 --> 02:03:31.160
seriously. But honestly, this, despite how you feel about this song, respect for a moment

Please, we'll be back here on Orange Last Radio.

02:04:01.160 --> 02:04:08.160

Leave them out on the streets at night

02:08:31.160 --> 02:08:34.160
I've been picking up those kind of strangers

02:08:34.160 --> 02:08:36.160
You can fly, you can fly

02:08:36.160 --> 02:08:40.160
When you can't go, you can fly, you can fly

02:08:40.160 --> 02:08:44.160
But you want it inside

02:08:44.160 --> 02:09:07.160
You ask yourself, who they are Like everybody else, they wanna be alone

02:09:07.160 --> 02:09:11.160
There comes, there comes, you've got your dirty back down

02:09:15.160 --> 02:09:19.160
There comes, there comes, you've got your dirty back down

02:09:19.160 --> 02:09:44.280
We are back, hi, on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:09:44.280 --> 02:09:48.040
We are such nerds, I was sitting there chatting on my DS with everyone else during the break.

02:09:48.040 --> 02:09:50.040
We have four DS's in this-

02:09:50.040 --> 02:09:54.040
I didn't think we had five, but I'm not breaking mine out.

02:09:54.040 --> 02:09:59.040
I know. Yeah, that's right. You got your DS here too, Jamie. We could just have a DS chat.

02:09:59.040 --> 02:10:01.040
I was trying to put some pictures there on the webcam.

02:10:01.040 --> 02:10:05.040
I wrote penis, really dark, so you guys could see it, and then put it in the chat room.

02:10:05.040 --> 02:10:07.040
Who's calling me during the show?

02:10:07.040 --> 02:10:09.040
These people should know better.

02:10:09.040 --> 02:10:11.040
Especially this person.

02:10:11.040 --> 02:10:13.040
Shame.

02:10:13.040 --> 02:10:15.040
Alright.

02:10:15.040 --> 02:10:16.040
I'm just waiting-

02:10:16.040 --> 02:10:17.040
What about- Yes.

02:10:17.040 --> 02:10:25.040
I'm just waiting for the emulator to work with bluetooth and then we'll get a wireless router so we can upload them all to a streaming chat room.

02:10:25.040 --> 02:10:27.040
That's the dream.

02:10:30.040 --> 02:10:37.040
Oh god, for the person who requested butterfly pikachu mix in the chat, no!

02:10:37.040 --> 02:10:40.040
I do have that, I do have that. No, I'm not going to fire them.

02:10:42.040 --> 02:10:45.040
Who wants to hear who won the cage match tonight?

02:10:45.040 --> 02:10:59.040
The winning song of tonight's cage match actually surprised me a little bit. It only won by two votes. Not one vote, but two votes. It all came down to two votes. The winning song of tonight's cage match.

02:11:05.040 --> 02:11:10.040
Believe it or not, it won. I'm actually surprised. I thought Monolithic had it sealed.

02:11:10.040 --> 02:11:13.340
Because she said it was going to be retired, and they want another retired one.

02:11:13.340 --> 02:11:22.340
That's basically it. So, Gwen Stefani is officially retired. It'll spend one more week in the spotlight, and then three brand new songs for you to listen to next week.

02:11:22.340 --> 02:11:24.340
As is her career.

02:11:25.340 --> 02:11:26.340
What?

02:11:26.340 --> 02:11:28.340
As is her career.

02:11:28.340 --> 02:11:38.900
I was going to take another call over Skype, but I know that our chatters are kind of shy

02:11:38.900 --> 02:11:43.020
and probably wouldn't want to call in, so how about we get into the FUs of the week?

02:11:43.020 --> 02:11:47.380
I think now is a good time, especially after that victory, to get into the FUs of the week.

02:11:47.380 --> 02:11:49.340
Does that sound like a plan for you, Jamie?

02:11:49.340 --> 02:11:50.340
Eh.

02:11:50.340 --> 02:11:55.460
Alright, and why is it, Miss Jamie, that we have to do the FUs of the week every single

02:11:55.460 --> 02:11:56.860
week on this show?

02:11:56.860 --> 02:12:03.860
because everything sucks

02:12:15.700 --> 02:12:23.340
big f u goes toward the stinky person on the plane who cut a big fart sitting in front of me

02:12:23.340 --> 02:12:30.420
F.U. goes toward just general backwards ass shit, having no free time, and my weird grammatical

02:12:30.420 --> 02:12:34.380
errors, and the four bottles of Guinness I had last night, and that's really about it.

02:12:34.380 --> 02:12:35.380
That's it?

02:12:35.380 --> 02:12:36.380
Yeah.

02:12:36.380 --> 02:12:48.500
I don't want a big F.U. to my mom for saying that her chronic bronchitis is not aggravated

02:12:48.500 --> 02:12:49.500
by cigarette smoke.

02:12:49.500 --> 02:12:50.500
No.

02:12:50.500 --> 02:12:55.500
Alright, you sure you're done? Are you sure?

02:12:55.500 --> 02:12:56.500
Yep.

02:12:56.500 --> 02:12:57.500
You sure?

02:12:57.500 --> 02:12:58.500
Yes.

02:12:58.500 --> 02:12:59.500
Alright. Alright, here we go. Loki, your turn.

02:12:59.500 --> 02:13:05.100
Fuck you, Folsom, on multiple occasions.

02:13:05.100 --> 02:13:11.340
Number one being, um, the lights, literally, the lights, the stop lights around here are

02:13:11.340 --> 02:13:16.180
so short. I came to a stop light. I saw it turn from

02:13:16.180 --> 02:13:17.240
green

02:13:17.240 --> 02:13:21.220
to read field uh...

02:13:21.220 --> 02:13:23.440
you know all the colors and everything

02:13:23.440 --> 02:13:25.300
with less than a second

02:13:25.300 --> 02:13:26.540
public what the fuck

02:13:26.540 --> 02:13:30.400
there's not even enough time for one car to go through life

02:13:30.400 --> 02:13:34.140
is ridiculous

02:13:34.140 --> 02:13:35.180
then uh...

02:13:35.180 --> 02:13:38.100
but you too uh... a giant marathon is out there

02:13:38.100 --> 02:13:39.300
fucking hell

02:13:39.300 --> 02:13:41.940
i've got a lot of eyes that we don't live around here

02:13:41.940 --> 02:13:43.660
the matter

02:13:43.660 --> 02:13:46.660
you didn't have to hear it five in the fucking morning

02:13:46.660 --> 02:13:50.020
PORC program

02:13:50.020 --> 02:13:53.060
County over giant loud speaker out

02:13:53.060 --> 02:13:56.320
right if but enough that they think to go for my parking vop

02:13:56.320 --> 02:14:00.240
up close to our apartment with gotten into the body or party

02:14:00.240 --> 02:14:04.540
okay four portn' potty meeting with 50 or two body

02:14:04.540 --> 02:14:07.740
along the street right date for more disease

02:14:07.740 --> 02:14:10.780
replays in the parking fees is along with

02:14:10.780 --> 02:14:15.760
some stupid booth, okay? Now, I'm no genius here, but since the fucking, you know, damn

02:14:15.760 --> 02:14:19.640
road is closed, eh, I'd say that's a pretty good chance that you could probably put that

02:14:19.640 --> 02:14:26.640
booth right there next to all the goddamn fucking porta-potties. Wow! Wouldn't that

02:14:26.640 --> 02:14:33.520
make sense? But no. So we have to make noise for three hours. Three hours in the morning.

02:14:33.520 --> 02:14:39.440
See, I was expecting not to hear the marathon because last time I slept through it, but,

02:14:39.440 --> 02:14:44.440
You know, I got woken up, and my first thing that came to my mind was, this is fucking

02:14:44.440 --> 02:14:45.940
ridiculous.

02:14:45.940 --> 02:14:49.960
And we went outside, and there's tons of runners, and trust me, if I'm outside-

02:14:49.960 --> 02:14:53.560
KCR A3 is protecting you with our live pinpoint Doppler radar.

02:14:53.560 --> 02:14:58.040
I don't fucking care about your pinpoint Doppler radar!

02:14:58.040 --> 02:15:01.760
I was trying to find a link to the chatroom.

02:15:01.760 --> 02:15:03.740
I was trying to find a link about the marathon.

02:15:03.740 --> 02:15:09.240
There was a story on a local news station I was going to send it to, that's actually

02:15:09.240 --> 02:15:20.120
kinda funny now that I think about it. F U channel 3. So anyway, yeah, that really sucks.

02:15:20.120 --> 02:15:30.840
Other than that, a premature, oh man, premature fuck you to my car that has to go in on Thursday,

02:15:30.840 --> 02:15:37.800
and it's gonna suck because I'm gonna, I know they're gonna try to screw me out of my fucking

02:15:37.800 --> 02:15:42.800
vinuvinumusic

02:16:07.800 --> 02:16:11.560
unintelligent people my entire life people that misspell something and then

02:16:11.560 --> 02:16:18.600
miss they're like for instance please help me out spell PL PL no PL I first

02:16:18.600 --> 02:16:24.480
and they're all I'm sorry and misspelled that PL is please please please help me

02:16:24.480 --> 02:16:31.280
out I'm going to Ragnarok chat my god I would say please learn how to spell

02:16:31.280 --> 02:16:35.720
anyways I just hate people and they're bad grammar I mean honestly I can

02:16:35.720 --> 02:16:56.720
I understand shorthand, you know, using R and U as actual words, even though they're not, um, but, you know, just, if you're going to at least spell correctly or do the abbreviations correctly, because I can't understand you when you're typing and all this weird shit, adding spaces where they do not belong, I don't know. I'm done.

02:16:56.720 --> 02:17:08.960
After you to that marathon that was going on outside the house this morning, seriously,

02:17:08.960 --> 02:17:12.460
you can go to like any Sacramento based website and read about this marathon, it's a huge

02:17:12.460 --> 02:17:14.000
event that happens every year.

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:18.680
I think that's great if you want to do a marathon and what have you, but freaking shut up or

02:17:18.680 --> 02:17:23.920
start the thing after, you know, after, there's a noise ordinance in the city that says do

02:17:23.920 --> 02:17:26.600
do not make noise until after eight a.m.

02:17:26.600 --> 02:17:29.540
So, frickin' turn your loudspeakers off until eight a.m.

02:17:29.540 --> 02:17:31.320
Or, you know what, it doesn't make sense to me.

02:17:31.320 --> 02:17:35.480
We live right behind a huge lake that is emptiness.

02:17:35.480 --> 02:17:37.460
There's nothing at the lake.

02:17:37.460 --> 02:17:39.720
Nobody goes to the lake in the wintertime.

02:17:39.720 --> 02:17:44.240
Start the marathon just like 300 feet away at the lake, okay?

02:17:44.240 --> 02:17:46.700
Honestly, it's a marathon.

02:17:46.700 --> 02:17:48.800
They can run a little further.

02:17:48.800 --> 02:17:52.800
But Rob, it's 9-11 and, you know, Paris.

02:17:52.800 --> 02:18:01.800
But here's the thing I don't understand, okay? I can understand, okay, I would have not had a problem if the guy is just like, you know, okay, we're gonna be starting the race at da da da da time, you know, this kind of thing?

02:18:01.800 --> 02:18:08.800
And then at the time, you know, five, four, three, two, one, go! You know, like he did. But no, he had the, and ah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah!

02:18:08.800 --> 02:18:17.800
He just talked for three hours straight! It's like, you know, I understand you have, you know, the P.A. and stuff to, you know, get a hold of, you know, the attention of these people.

02:18:17.800 --> 02:18:22.680
these people. But you don't need to fucking talk, like, all the time! Just say, okay,

02:18:22.680 --> 02:18:26.880
well, you know, announce, you know, 15 minutes before the race starts, you know, so you can

02:18:26.880 --> 02:18:31.560
get in your marks, you know, and then do the countdown, and that's it! Oh, and then there's

02:18:31.560 --> 02:18:38.040
a fucking siren after that! Wooooo! Like, cause you didn't, you didn't see, oh, why

02:18:38.040 --> 02:18:43.160
are all those people running? One more thing I forgot to add, sorry I'm stealing your thing,

02:18:43.160 --> 02:18:44.920
what do you believe the party here

02:18:44.920 --> 02:18:46.580
because the report

02:18:46.580 --> 02:18:50.680
now i get that the ok i'd get the f you to the police department because frickin

02:18:50.680 --> 02:18:53.240
i called them at six thirty in the morning thing

02:18:53.240 --> 02:18:57.080
there is a marathon going on side of the outside this house i'm sure you're aware

02:18:57.080 --> 02:19:00.040
but they are being way too loud and that he's what she's like

02:19:00.040 --> 02:19:02.380
sorry sir there's nothing i can do about that

02:19:02.380 --> 02:19:05.300
i said are you aware that there's no there's a city ordinance that they can

02:19:05.300 --> 02:19:06.840
ignore it before eight a m

02:19:06.840 --> 02:19:09.960
if you have an issue that you have to call city hall and request a permit

02:19:09.960 --> 02:19:14.040
Now I'm gonna have to look like a big, Grinchy asshole when the fact of the matter is I'm

02:19:14.040 --> 02:19:17.480
probably not even gonna live here next year, but I am not gonna let this shit slide!

02:19:17.480 --> 02:19:22.480
I am pissed that they woke me up at 6.30 on a freaking Sunday when I was out drinking

02:19:22.480 --> 02:19:23.480
the night before!

02:19:23.480 --> 02:19:24.480
ASS!

02:19:24.480 --> 02:19:28.080
Sorry, Loki, you had a thought.

02:19:28.080 --> 02:19:31.480
My thought was because this police officer parked his car in the middle of the fucking

02:19:31.480 --> 02:19:37.640
lane on the street, no reason, just sitting there with his flashers on, not blocking traffic

02:19:37.640 --> 02:19:41.320
because there's an accident or he pulled someone over or he was

02:19:41.320 --> 02:19:44.120
filling around with god knows what you've worked in the middle of fucking

02:19:44.120 --> 02:19:45.200
road

02:19:45.200 --> 02:19:47.320
for no reason

02:19:47.320 --> 02:19:49.340
so i went around it

02:19:49.340 --> 02:19:50.800
on the inside

02:19:50.800 --> 02:19:52.280
at

02:19:52.280 --> 02:19:56.020

02:20:08.440 --> 02:20:10.920
Awesome, and you should sign it, even though you don't live here.

02:20:10.920 --> 02:20:12.360
Alright.

02:20:12.360 --> 02:20:16.040
Let's go around and get some other folks in the studio to get their FUs of the week.

02:20:16.040 --> 02:20:18.600
We'll start off with Angel.

02:20:18.600 --> 02:20:21.400
Um...

02:20:21.400 --> 02:20:25.920
Just FU to...

02:20:25.920 --> 02:20:28.080
Yeah, I don't know. Shit.

02:20:28.080 --> 02:20:30.040
I actually don't really have one.

02:20:30.040 --> 02:20:33.040
FU to my instructor because he's mad.

02:20:33.040 --> 02:20:37.560
he's actually letting us out on the 8th or something like that

02:20:37.560 --> 02:20:44.560
but uh... we still gotta come back to the finals, so I don't know what's up with that. I don't know, whatever.

02:20:44.840 --> 02:20:50.640
Arcadian42, you're up use of the week.

02:20:50.640 --> 02:20:51.840
Alright, make sure...

02:20:51.840 --> 02:20:54.560
Can you hear me? Can you? I can hear you.

02:20:54.560 --> 02:20:56.960
Okay, uh...

02:20:56.960 --> 02:21:06.960
I don't know about the winter, it just makes my skin start getting all dry and I just drink lots of water, but it still doesn't help.

02:21:06.960 --> 02:21:18.960
Anyway, yeah, and Loki was talking about stupid traffic lights. There's one near my work that's stupid that's misprogrammed.

02:21:18.960 --> 02:21:23.680
like changes in five seconds after like five seconds from green to yellow

02:21:23.680 --> 02:21:28.080
and some like recently they fucked up the timing so that

02:21:28.080 --> 02:21:31.120
this crossroad isn't getting all that much traffic it's like

02:21:31.120 --> 02:21:34.920
you have to sit there for a minute before it goes back to green

02:21:34.920 --> 02:21:38.920
so that's annoying

02:21:38.920 --> 02:21:41.200
get a laziness

02:21:41.200 --> 02:21:43.640
but still hurting evening from

02:21:43.640 --> 02:21:45.640
plain DDO or something

02:21:45.640 --> 02:21:47.640
Lazy, yeah, whatever.

02:22:15.640 --> 02:22:21.720
walking in the fucking freeway just because the fucking marathon was going on. Oh, you're

02:22:21.720 --> 02:22:30.720
just going to cause more trouble to the fucking freeway. Thanks a lot. Okay. And F.E. to the

02:22:30.720 --> 02:22:37.400
forums nowadays saying about girls playing DDR or gays playing DDR. Who gives a shit?

02:22:37.400 --> 02:22:44.200
People play DDR. That is all. I have something to say about that, but I'll wait until later.

02:22:44.200 --> 02:22:47.800
Nobody knows that girls and gays have no place in DDR.

02:22:47.800 --> 02:22:49.440
I was not going to say that by just saying.

02:22:49.440 --> 02:22:53.920
You know, two-thirds of the show is comprised of girls and gays, so I would watch your little

02:22:53.920 --> 02:22:54.920
mouth there.

02:22:54.920 --> 02:22:58.120
I mean, I'm just saying, it's just DDR.

02:22:58.120 --> 02:23:00.640
There's nothing special about it.

02:23:00.640 --> 02:23:07.160
Some people take it way too seriously in the forums.

02:23:07.160 --> 02:23:10.320
All right, is that it?

02:23:10.320 --> 02:23:15.320
FU2 Finals coming up soon.

02:23:15.320 --> 02:23:22.320
FU2 for not being able to spend money for Christmas because I have to spend some money on bills and stuff.

02:23:22.320 --> 02:23:24.320
And that's about it for now.

02:23:24.320 --> 02:23:26.320
Alright, let's get to the chatroom FUs.

02:23:26.320 --> 02:23:28.320
They're mad at me because I told them they had to keep it short tonight.

02:23:28.320 --> 02:23:29.320
They don't like that.

02:23:29.320 --> 02:23:31.320
But seriously, we've got like 20 people that send FUs in tonight.

02:23:31.320 --> 02:23:32.320
It's a lot.

02:23:32.320 --> 02:23:33.320
We need to go ahead and read one, though.

02:23:33.320 --> 02:23:34.320
Yes, Jamie has one.

02:23:34.320 --> 02:23:35.320
She wants to read first.

02:23:35.320 --> 02:23:41.320
Because I'm actually on AAM right now and I'm not telling anybody what name I'm on.

02:23:41.320 --> 02:23:45.320
It's a FU from Vogue Web Security.

02:23:45.320 --> 02:23:50.320
A big FU to our roommate M for eating all of our food and not buying anything.

02:23:50.320 --> 02:23:56.440
shipping ramps good sushi make all right dark knight would like to give a

02:23:56.440 --> 02:24:00.220
gigantic fu to me getting sick and working at the same time somebody shoot

02:24:00.220 --> 02:24:03.600
me please and one more f you for my dumbness when I took my placement test

02:24:03.600 --> 02:24:06.680
during the week talk about brain farts man

02:24:06.680 --> 02:24:11.920
seagurd says first f you goes to the show for not talking about drawn

02:24:11.920 --> 02:24:16.920
together nearly enough for you f you to illusion for turning down offers of sex

02:24:16.920 --> 02:24:21.220
for his vote, and FU to Hot Topic for not having any drawn together shirts, even though

02:24:21.220 --> 02:24:25.740
they don't exist yet. You know, think about it this way. If Illusion had changed his vote

02:24:25.740 --> 02:24:29.780
from Gwen to Monolithic, then it would have been a tie, and Jamie probably would have

02:24:29.780 --> 02:24:33.780
went with Monolithic when she broke the tie. So, just think about that one.

02:24:33.780 --> 02:24:41.820
No, wait, no. Oh, okay, well, hey. Flaronay says, FU to Nintendo for not allowing Game

02:24:41.820 --> 02:24:45.060
Game Boy and Game Boy Color games to be played on the DS.

02:24:45.060 --> 02:24:46.680
What the fuck?

02:24:46.680 --> 02:24:50.360
This just goes along with Nintendo's method of getting you to buy the same thing 50 million

02:24:50.360 --> 02:24:51.360
times.

02:24:51.360 --> 02:24:56.520
MPQ says, F you to Microsoft for not letting me install Japanese IME.

02:24:56.520 --> 02:24:58.120
I'm having that same problem too.

02:24:58.120 --> 02:25:00.440
F you to Suncoast for ripping me off and charging me...

02:25:00.440 --> 02:25:01.440
What?

02:25:01.440 --> 02:25:02.440
What?

02:25:02.440 --> 02:25:03.440
Explicit what?

02:25:03.440 --> 02:25:08.440
You have to download a different patch, not the global IME from Microsoft.

02:25:08.440 --> 02:25:10.440
Oh, maybe that's what's going on.

02:25:10.440 --> 02:25:11.440
All right.

02:25:11.440 --> 02:25:12.940
Who am I gonna meet for that?

02:25:12.940 --> 02:25:17.740
Uh, FU to Suncoast for ripping me off and charging me $30 a disc for Azumanga Daioh.

02:25:17.740 --> 02:25:18.740
I hope I said that right.

02:25:18.740 --> 02:25:19.940
FU to the Ta-

02:25:19.940 --> 02:25:21.240
What? What was that?

02:25:21.240 --> 02:25:22.740
You said it right, Azumanga Daioh.

02:25:22.740 --> 02:25:25.240
Hey, I pronounced something right. What do you know?

02:25:25.240 --> 02:25:29.240
FU to the Taiko Drumsticks for being uncomfortable and hurting my hands.

02:25:29.240 --> 02:25:32.240
FU to people who call it Singles and Doubles on DDR.

02:25:32.240 --> 02:25:34.240
It's not tennis.

02:25:34.240 --> 02:25:36.740
Lastly, fuck everyone who has access to 2DX.

02:25:36.740 --> 02:25:38.240
It's Singles and Doubles.

02:25:38.240 --> 02:25:39.740
The fuck you talking about? It is Singles and Doubles.

02:25:39.740 --> 02:25:42.380
It's been singles and doubles since the first one.

02:25:42.380 --> 02:25:43.740
I think...

02:25:43.740 --> 02:25:45.060
What about Crack Planet?

02:25:45.060 --> 02:25:48.620
I think it might be the way in which you say it.

02:25:48.620 --> 02:25:50.940
I think I might get what it is.

02:25:50.940 --> 02:25:54.340
I think I get the tennis comparison.

02:25:54.340 --> 02:25:58.020
Did I get the fuck everyone who has access to 2DX? I don't know.

02:25:58.020 --> 02:25:59.740
Those are from MPQ.

02:25:59.740 --> 02:26:05.740
Poto says, F you to World of Warcraft eating up every second of my life.

02:26:05.740 --> 02:26:10.260
Jaded2004 says, F you to everyone who hates smile decay.

02:26:10.260 --> 02:26:13.660
Rychan says, F you to myself for being emotionally stupid last night.

02:26:13.660 --> 02:26:16.620
F you to egos killing the gaming star.

02:26:16.620 --> 02:26:17.980
Hey, didn't I say that one?

02:26:17.980 --> 02:26:20.740
F you to tomorrow not being Thursday.

02:26:20.740 --> 02:26:22.900
Big hug, Rychan, big hug.

02:26:22.900 --> 02:26:28.020
Blarg says, F you to egalitarians?

02:26:28.020 --> 02:26:30.060
Egalitarians.

02:26:30.060 --> 02:26:31.780
Egalitarians, I can pronounce words.

02:26:31.780 --> 02:26:33.260
I just have to sound it out in my mind.

02:26:33.260 --> 02:26:36.580
Misty says, first and foremost, F you to the cage match.

02:26:36.580 --> 02:26:39.540
Secondly, F you to chicken tenders and French toast sticks.

02:26:39.540 --> 02:26:41.100
Cause I think I'm just pissed about that

02:26:41.100 --> 02:26:43.900
cause I was working those parts of the kitchen at the time.

02:26:45.540 --> 02:26:47.980
Oops, I hope I didn't close the new window.

02:26:47.980 --> 02:26:50.300
I hope I didn't miss somebody's F you, sorry if I did.

02:26:50.300 --> 02:26:52.720
Snow Cat says, F you to having a birthday in December

02:26:52.720 --> 02:26:53.840
and to people who think it's better

02:26:53.840 --> 02:26:56.580
to combine presents, bastards.

02:26:56.580 --> 02:26:59.060
DJ Ramez says, giant F you to my job

02:26:59.060 --> 02:27:00.140
for cutting my hours again.

02:27:00.140 --> 02:27:02.580
You bastards, I gotta eat too, you know.

02:27:02.580 --> 02:27:06.380
Another F.U. to the retard tech that I work with, you are a fucking tool.

02:27:06.380 --> 02:27:10.660
I swear if you did get a job through affirmative action, I'm putting in my two weeks.

02:27:10.660 --> 02:27:12.300
F.U. short version.

02:27:12.300 --> 02:27:15.300
Oh, well I read the long version.

02:27:15.300 --> 02:27:18.060
Legend of Zaku says, F.U. to not having a girlfriend.

02:27:18.060 --> 02:27:21.460
F.U. to all the drama that I have to put up with in the DDR Freak New York forums,

02:27:21.460 --> 02:27:24.260
thus resulting in the locking of the forums for a short time,

02:27:24.260 --> 02:27:26.220
and the near split that was about to happen.

02:27:26.220 --> 02:27:32.500
And F.U. to the Chinese language for being so fucking hard to speak and write.

02:27:32.500 --> 02:27:35.380
I could say something about the New York forum thing.

02:27:35.380 --> 02:27:37.100
I'll leave a comment.

02:27:37.100 --> 02:27:39.500
OK, I'll comment, because I have no status on freaks,

02:27:39.500 --> 02:27:42.340
so it's fine for me to comment.

02:27:42.340 --> 02:27:45.420
You guys need to learn how to respect authority.

02:27:45.420 --> 02:27:46.860
I'm not saying you in particular,

02:27:46.860 --> 02:27:49.380
but I mean, it seems like when somebody says, don't do this,

02:27:49.380 --> 02:27:50.840
like a million people want to do it.

02:27:50.840 --> 02:27:54.180
And then you wonder why people get angry.

02:27:54.180 --> 02:27:55.300
Anyway.

02:27:55.300 --> 02:27:57.580
Films off the internet.

02:27:57.580 --> 02:27:59.980
Anyway.

02:27:59.980 --> 02:28:02.180
I'm going to get shit for that, but I don't care.

02:28:02.180 --> 02:28:04.580
Dark Tetsuya says, a continued FU to Comcast.

02:28:04.580 --> 02:28:07.220
I recently got to see the nuclear train wreck that

02:28:07.220 --> 02:28:09.320
is the new screen savers.

02:28:09.320 --> 02:28:12.820
I can tell the show's going down the toilet.

02:28:12.820 --> 02:28:16.660
Oh my god, Rob, you said nuclear.

02:28:16.660 --> 02:28:18.340
It's a joke.

02:28:18.340 --> 02:28:21.060
FU to Xbox Live on UltraMix 2 being so glitchy

02:28:21.060 --> 02:28:23.700
that we had to start the tournament over five times

02:28:23.700 --> 02:28:25.820
because it kept quitting and being glitchy.

02:28:25.820 --> 02:28:27.740
FU to the douche bags in my English class

02:28:27.740 --> 02:28:30.140
that don't have the brain capacity to talk about anything

02:28:30.140 --> 02:28:34.340
other than sports for more than five seconds at a time. And FU to Seagurd for cheating

02:28:34.340 --> 02:28:44.340
on me. Man, what a whore. Oh my. VX Jason XV, who says I should just call him Jason but

02:28:44.340 --> 02:28:49.460
I don't, says FU to data entry. It makes us lazy people cry. Funny that I call myself

02:28:49.460 --> 02:28:53.060
lazy, although I'm writing a program to parse data for me automatically instead of taking

02:28:53.060 --> 02:29:01.500
less time to just do it myself. And F you to irony. And that's gonna do it for the F

02:29:01.500 --> 02:29:06.300
yous of the week. Thanks for playing, boys and girls. Yes, Logie. One last one. Fuck

02:29:06.300 --> 02:29:13.860
you to KFC for getting rid of your sweet and sour sauce. Why would KFC get rid of sweet

02:29:13.860 --> 02:29:18.020
and sour sauce? Did PETA make him do that or something? They just got rid of their sweet

02:29:18.020 --> 02:29:22.700
and sour sauce. I got popcorn chicken like last week from there. And I was like, okay,

02:29:22.700 --> 02:29:26.640
I want some sweet and extra sweet and sour sauce on the side. Oh, we don't have sweet and sour sauce. What?

02:29:27.260 --> 02:29:29.260
What is this craziness?

02:29:29.620 --> 02:29:34.460
I don't get it. What the hell? Why would you? That was like the best sauce they had. Now they have ranch.

02:29:35.100 --> 02:29:37.100
Whoo, ranch.

02:29:37.100 --> 02:29:40.060
Ranching mustard. Honey mustard.

02:29:41.180 --> 02:29:46.000
I want my fucking sweet and sour sauce. It's like classic. McDonald's has their sweet and sour sauce. Fuck,

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:47.860
I eat the sweet and sour sauce by itself.

02:29:47.860 --> 02:29:52.860
I mean, I don't understand why you can't just, you know, give me the nice sweet and sour sauce you had.

02:29:52.860 --> 02:29:55.860
I'd buy up the reserves. I would.

02:29:55.860 --> 02:29:57.860
Anyways.

02:29:57.860 --> 02:29:59.860
I think it's time to go to our break, boys and girls.

02:29:59.860 --> 02:30:02.860
When we come back from this break, I think we'll do a little bit of Ask Orange Lounge,

02:30:02.860 --> 02:30:05.860
and we'll open up the Skype line again for those of you guys who want to get through and comment.

02:30:05.860 --> 02:30:06.860
Excuse me.

02:30:06.860 --> 02:30:11.860
So send in your questions for Ask Orange Lounge over private message to Sky in the chat room right now.

02:30:11.860 --> 02:30:14.860
In this break, I think we'll do some songs from 2DX.

02:30:14.860 --> 02:30:21.860
Just some 2DX potpourri. Enjoy.

02:31:14.860 --> 02:31:15.860
I said you know what?!

02:31:15.860 --> 02:31:16.860
It's late!

02:31:16.860 --> 02:31:17.860
Free love and be free!

02:32:14.520 --> 02:32:16.520
Thanks for watching!

02:33:14.520 --> 02:33:20.520
One day, one day

02:33:20.520 --> 02:33:23.520
Monday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday

02:33:23.520 --> 02:33:26.520
With the cynical boom in the back of my neck

02:33:26.520 --> 02:33:29.520
I get blinded every day

02:33:29.520 --> 02:33:30.520
I can do it

02:33:30.520 --> 02:33:31.520
I can do it

02:33:31.520 --> 02:33:49.940
Kind of you

02:33:49.940 --> 02:33:54.820
Have you found

02:33:54.820 --> 02:33:57.700
An enemy

02:33:57.700 --> 02:34:11.700
Ooh, oh, you and I, won't let go, won't let go

02:34:57.700 --> 02:34:59.700
Let's go!

02:35:57.700 --> 02:36:24.700
Orange Lounge Radio, we put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.

02:36:24.700 --> 02:36:27.460
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:36:27.460 --> 02:36:32.280
chat room has gone crazy. I was making some jokes during the break there, and now everybody's

02:36:32.280 --> 02:36:36.980
talking about my pants. And I feel bad because there's a guy in there that really just needs

02:36:36.980 --> 02:36:42.080
a hug right now, and the talk about my pants and my name in various Bomani games is eclipsing

02:36:42.080 --> 02:36:48.000
that conversation, so I feel bad. Anyway, back to the dick and fart jokes we're talking

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:51.540
about here on Orange Lounge Radio. No, seriously, I wanted to bring something up that Xplizit

02:36:51.540 --> 02:36:56.480
was talking about during his FUs of the Week. I felt kind of bad for this guy over on The

02:36:56.480 --> 02:36:59.700
the freak who had posted something in the NorCal forums, are there any other gay people

02:36:59.700 --> 02:37:05.400
that play DDR? And people just kind of, like when you jump down this guy's throat going,

02:37:05.400 --> 02:37:10.680
it doesn't matter! Why are you posting this shit? It shouldn't matter! And you know what?

02:37:10.680 --> 02:37:14.440
They're right. It shouldn't matter. And the way the guy had kind of worded the original

02:37:14.440 --> 02:37:18.000
post, he was kind of throwing out some facts that were a little crazy and stuff like that.

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:22.920
But, I was kind of trying to look at it from his point of view. And as somebody who happens

02:37:22.920 --> 02:37:25.880
to be a gay male, and if you listen to the show by now, it's no secret to you that I

02:37:25.880 --> 02:37:33.080
happen to be a homosexual no I mean I know and I know a lot of people don't

02:37:33.080 --> 02:37:38.600
like that so like homophobia is so 90s okay seriously I think a lot of people

02:37:38.600 --> 02:37:42.400
truly don't give a crap anymore and granted it's not gone completely I think

02:37:42.400 --> 02:37:47.920
the last election shows that where what what is this I'm trying to see your I am

02:37:47.920 --> 02:37:56.960
window here oh god more pants chat thank you very much no it doesn't but I kind

02:37:56.960 --> 02:38:01.240
of feel bad for the guy because when you are gay sometimes it is hard to meet

02:38:01.240 --> 02:38:04.520
people in the same way that straight people kind of meet each other and

02:38:04.520 --> 02:38:07.200
especially if you're the kind of person that's had an upbringing where you've

02:38:07.200 --> 02:38:10.200
had to be very sheltered and closeted and kind of secretive about your

02:38:10.200 --> 02:38:14.800
lifestyle sometimes you just kind of want to fly out of the closet and meet

02:38:14.800 --> 02:38:19.320
as many people as you can that are like you. So I kind of understand where he's coming

02:38:19.320 --> 02:38:22.920
from a little bit, where it is hard. You can't just walk up to people on the street and go,

02:38:22.920 --> 02:38:29.920
hey, you gay? I know it's happened to all of you before, but it's not very nice.

02:38:30.160 --> 02:38:36.160
Hey, girl, you want to grow up with me? But seriously, if you're gay, just talk to people.

02:38:36.160 --> 02:38:41.760
It doesn't matter if you're gay or not. Where I think the guy may have made a mistake is

02:38:41.760 --> 02:38:47.360
is maybe DDR Freak just isn't maybe the place. People want to talk DDR on DDR Freak. They

02:38:47.360 --> 02:38:50.120
don't want to talk about, you know. But I think he was just looking for gay people who

02:38:50.120 --> 02:38:53.360
are into DDR. So I PM'd him to Lynx because there's actually a live drone community that's

02:38:53.360 --> 02:38:57.480
like gay DDR players. There's gay gamers, get it? Gamers communities and stuff like

02:38:57.480 --> 02:38:58.480
that, so.

02:38:58.480 --> 02:39:01.000
Well, yeah. It's okay to post on the NorCal and stuff, but I mean, you see that all the

02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:05.480
time in DDR chit chat and stuff and general discussion. Like, you see, like, hundreds

02:39:05.480 --> 02:39:07.200
of topics like that and...

02:39:07.200 --> 02:39:18.200
Now, yeah, and I agree. Now, it's almost, almost, it's very similar to the girls that play DDR topic, because for whatever reason, now, there's a difference, though. There's a difference.

02:39:18.200 --> 02:39:31.200
When it's a guy posting, are there any girls that play DDR? That's one thing. Yeah, exactly. That's just, you know, somebody who's sitting there downloading Violent Hypergirls freestyle videos.

02:39:31.200 --> 02:39:39.020
love you Aaron love you Aaron and but when it's a girl posting are there other

02:39:39.020 --> 02:39:41.940
girls that play DDR well then you know you're just kind of like okay well maybe

02:39:41.940 --> 02:39:45.700
you know it's kind of too bad that there aren't a lot of girls that you know go

02:39:45.700 --> 02:39:48.480
out to the arcade and but I think DDR has been bringing more I think there's

02:39:48.480 --> 02:39:51.860
been more and more but just in the past there's more and more now but

02:39:51.860 --> 02:39:54.460
especially when I first started playing there wasn't a whole lot that I would

02:39:54.460 --> 02:39:57.780
see their case back in the days before DDR when I would play pinball I maybe

02:39:57.780 --> 02:39:59.780
maybe once or twice saw a girl at the arcade.

02:39:59.780 --> 02:40:02.780
I only saw one girl back then, but now I see like a bunch of girls.

02:40:02.780 --> 02:40:06.780
Well, I'm not sure if it's because of the F.U. tournament I helped organize in Sacramento

02:40:06.780 --> 02:40:11.780
or just the whole tournament issues nowadays that people want to get involved with.

02:40:11.780 --> 02:40:14.780
When I see girls posting that on the ZDR Freak forums, I think,

02:40:14.780 --> 02:40:16.780
Ooh, lesbians!

02:40:16.780 --> 02:40:18.780
That's what I think.

02:40:18.780 --> 02:40:22.780
You're a little girl, girl-on-girl mix.

02:40:22.780 --> 02:40:26.780
Jamie, do you have anything you want to add to this horrible discussion?

02:40:26.780 --> 02:40:28.780
Your pants are hot.

02:40:28.780 --> 02:40:30.780
Shove it.

02:40:31.780 --> 02:40:34.780
I know this is very late. It's another F.U.

02:40:34.780 --> 02:40:37.780
F.U. to splitting my pants open this morning.

02:40:37.780 --> 02:40:39.780
That sucks.

02:40:39.780 --> 02:40:42.780
I was reaching for something and all of a sudden I heard this rip

02:40:42.780 --> 02:40:44.780
and there was my crotch exposed.

02:40:44.780 --> 02:40:45.780
Oh, speaking of rip...

02:40:45.780 --> 02:40:47.780
You know what that means, right? You fat.

02:40:48.780 --> 02:40:52.780
No, what it means is that I was laying on my pants and trying to stretch at the same time.

02:40:52.780 --> 02:40:59.780
time. It does not mean I'm fat, you dumbass. That's explicit. Did you get something you

02:40:59.780 --> 02:41:02.620
wanted to say? No, I'm not going to comment on the look in that one. Well then fine, you're

02:41:02.620 --> 02:41:08.220
fat too. Look, it does look fat. I just showed you my stomach, do I look fat? You're going

02:41:08.220 --> 02:41:14.180
to make me straight, God. Alright, you know there's a cam right there. Oh, okay. Oh,

02:41:14.180 --> 02:41:16.180
Look at my foot!

02:41:20.180 --> 02:41:23.180
Okay, sorry if it scares people for that.

02:41:23.180 --> 02:41:25.180
I'm changing the subject.

02:41:29.180 --> 02:41:32.180
Let's ask OrangeLounge some stupid questions.

02:41:32.180 --> 02:41:36.180
What will we find out this week on OrangeLoungeRadio?

02:41:36.180 --> 02:41:40.180
One thing we won't find out because he already said,

02:41:40.180 --> 02:41:47.180
Loki split his pants today, therefore he must be fat.

02:41:50.180 --> 02:41:52.820
You know, the butcher's knife is still clean.

02:41:52.820 --> 02:41:57.620
It's one of the only dishes that's not dirty yet.

02:41:57.620 --> 02:42:01.060
Sigurd has a question starting it off. This will make you feel better, Loki.

02:42:01.060 --> 02:42:07.220
Who is your favorite drawn together character and why?

02:42:07.220 --> 02:42:10.120
Mine is Xander for obvious reasons.

02:42:10.120 --> 02:42:13.200
Mine is Nolan because I have a life and don't watch TV.

02:42:13.200 --> 02:42:17.120
Oh my god, that's such a tough question.

02:42:17.120 --> 02:42:19.720
Oh man, uh...

02:42:19.720 --> 02:42:23.800
I would have to say Ling Ling. I love Ling Ling and just how

02:42:23.800 --> 02:42:25.800
funny and Japanese it is.

02:42:25.800 --> 02:42:29.840
And just like, it's more of like two characters.

02:42:29.840 --> 02:42:33.340
It's Spanky and Ling Ling, their interactive

02:42:33.340 --> 02:42:36.680
interactions. That's the best part, you know.

02:42:36.680 --> 02:42:40.860
but Ling Ling's hilarious and um...

02:42:40.860 --> 02:42:44.900
Are you looking for the Christmas?

02:42:44.900 --> 02:42:47.940
Well, too bad there's not a Santa Claus.

02:42:47.940 --> 02:42:51.020
Let's see, it was Xander who said that.

02:42:51.020 --> 02:42:53.840
I would say my second favorite would be Foxy Love.

02:42:53.840 --> 02:42:56.720
I love Foxy Love.

02:42:56.720 --> 02:42:58.320
Bleh.

02:42:58.320 --> 02:43:00.920
Anyway.

02:43:00.920 --> 02:43:03.180
Uh, next question from MPQ.

02:43:03.180 --> 02:43:07.100
How many people care about the song Cartoon Heroes? It seems to me

02:43:07.100 --> 02:43:09.220
that people actually want the steps

02:43:09.220 --> 02:43:10.560
rather than the song.

02:43:10.560 --> 02:43:13.780
Do you think it would work if they took the steps and then put them on a hundred and seventy

02:43:13.780 --> 02:43:16.240
beat-per-minute Konami original or something?

02:43:16.240 --> 02:43:20.180
That's the one thing I can kind of see about Cartoon Heroes, why so many people want that song.

02:43:20.180 --> 02:43:23.660
That's my point before. Is it the steps? Okay, that's fine. That's my point.

02:43:23.660 --> 02:43:27.340
And I don't think it would work on any other song. I mean, it would just be weird.

02:43:27.340 --> 02:43:31.920
So if Cartoon Heroes was like a seven-footer and had very easy steps, no one would play it.

02:43:31.920 --> 02:43:37.920
But see, I don't... You're cutting out a little bit. He's saying something about the fact that if it was a 7-footer, not as many people would play it.

02:43:37.920 --> 02:43:43.920
I somewhat disagree. I think there's people that play it because they play Speed Over Beethoven as well. You know, that whole type of thing.

02:43:43.920 --> 02:43:46.920
Or we could say if the song was...

02:43:48.920 --> 02:43:53.920
Yeah, if it goes 140 BPM, then no one would play it at all.

02:43:53.920 --> 02:43:57.920
Think of the songs that are over 170 BPM being overplayed.

02:43:57.920 --> 02:44:02.920
This is my thing, and this is the same thing when people ask, why aren't there enough 10-footers in DDR?

02:44:02.920 --> 02:44:07.920
Can you really play 10-footers on a homepad? I mean, if you can and you're passing them, good for you.

02:44:07.920 --> 02:44:14.920
But you are in a minority. Let's face it, you are in the minority if you can pass those kinds of songs on a homepad.

02:44:14.920 --> 02:44:21.920
Do you think all songs must be 10-footers? Oh, let's go, duh-duh-duh-duh-duh, every freaking song.

02:44:21.920 --> 02:44:26.920
That's why you can make edits if you don't like the steps. Simple question.

02:44:26.920 --> 02:44:32.920
Or just play in the groove and just hammer the machine so much so your feet dies and shit.

02:44:32.920 --> 02:44:36.920
Okay, if there's one thing I'm not doing at home, it's hamplants. End of story.

02:44:36.920 --> 02:44:40.920
Those fucking comments! Hamplants are so, like, 98.

02:44:40.920 --> 02:44:46.920
Hamplants are so ancient. Civilization. We don't go around kung-kung-kung.

02:44:46.920 --> 02:44:52.920
You're not for just rape. You don't need anyone to fight rape.

02:44:52.920 --> 02:45:02.720
Darkknight, everyone must be at the computer or on the webcam because all I see is Bradley.

02:45:02.720 --> 02:45:03.720
You're right.

02:45:03.720 --> 02:45:08.800
Our webcam kind of needs a new angle, I think, because obviously a lot of us kind of hide

02:45:08.800 --> 02:45:09.800
back here.

02:45:09.800 --> 02:45:10.800
But not at me.

02:45:10.800 --> 02:45:11.800
He needs a spotlight.

02:45:11.800 --> 02:45:12.800
Yeah.

02:45:12.800 --> 02:45:13.800
We're angels kind of hiding back here.

02:45:13.800 --> 02:45:15.280
She's sitting on the ground next to Loki and I.

02:45:15.280 --> 02:45:18.400
And I see that Angel has candy, so I'm going to steal some.

02:45:18.400 --> 02:45:19.640
What the hell are you thinking?

02:45:19.640 --> 02:45:20.640
Wait, what?

02:45:20.640 --> 02:45:22.640
No, it's in the form of some Matrix wall.

02:45:22.640 --> 02:45:27.640
I don't want to bring up another F.U., I just...

02:45:27.640 --> 02:45:29.640
Fucking Natalie Portman for not getting naked.

02:45:29.640 --> 02:45:31.640
I fucking hate that.

02:45:31.640 --> 02:45:32.640
You don't go see a movie.

02:45:32.640 --> 02:45:34.640
Okay, it's a fucking chick flick.

02:45:34.640 --> 02:45:45.640
Now, granted, there are some very funny scenes in there, like the whole, um, uh, what was that, internet, um, like net porn type thing sequence that they had to classical music.

02:45:45.640 --> 02:45:46.640
Now, that was funny.

02:45:46.640 --> 02:45:48.640
That was the best part in the whole movie.

02:45:48.640 --> 02:45:54.240
movie. But Natalie Portman was not fucking naked. They advertise this movie as her being

02:45:54.240 --> 02:46:01.440
naked, and she was not naked. Why? Why? Why? So, she falls in the same category now as

02:46:01.440 --> 02:46:08.200
the Olsen twins, whereas she needs to do porn. It's because I want to see her career tank.

02:46:08.200 --> 02:46:09.200
Bye.

02:46:09.200 --> 02:46:12.360
Alright, let's get to Dark Knight's real question here. That was just an observation he was

02:46:12.360 --> 02:46:16.620
making here's a question here's a question for y'all if there was an

02:46:16.620 --> 02:46:21.400
America Americanized Japanese show that you wouldn't that you would want to be

02:46:21.400 --> 02:46:24.880
taken off the air which would it be

02:46:25.080 --> 02:46:30.640
but that I have the perfect answer and you'll agree with me

02:46:30.640 --> 02:46:37.440
Iron Chef America Oh God no we need more real Iron Chef Iron Chef needs to come

02:46:37.440 --> 02:46:43.240
back on the air, the original. Damn it, we need the Chiba to come out of retirement and

02:46:43.240 --> 02:46:49.000
kick all their asses. I absolutely agree, Iron Chef America. Bobby Flay is a fucking

02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:57.000
faggot, I hate him. Not in the gay way, not in the gay way, as in like, he sucks. As in

02:46:57.000 --> 02:47:03.160
he's a bundle of sticks. Yes, a bundle of sticks. No, I fucking hate Bobby Flay, he's

02:47:03.160 --> 02:47:08.580
little whiny bitch okay I was gonna say I was gonna say don't insult faggots

02:47:08.580 --> 02:47:16.040
please all right let's do Zach who says okay my 2dx skills are what some would

02:47:16.040 --> 02:47:19.600
say subpar how does one make the conversion from single-handed seven key

02:47:19.600 --> 02:47:23.440
play to double handed play so that when I go out to play 2dx again I don't end

02:47:23.440 --> 02:47:28.160
up sucking I think training mode on the home versions there's really good but

02:47:28.160 --> 02:47:32.240
you said you don't have training mode so you're kind of screwed buddy I hate to

02:47:32.240 --> 02:47:35.240
Honestly, you're just going to have to practice, practice, practice.

02:47:35.240 --> 02:47:41.240
Arkadian, you play a lot of 2DX. Do you have any advice you could give to our buddy, Zaku, if we can hear you on that mic?

02:47:41.240 --> 02:47:43.240
Practice. That's the only thing you really do.

02:47:43.240 --> 02:47:49.240
There really is nothing else you can do. There's no trick. There's no wrist exercise or anything you can do. You just got to practice.

02:47:49.240 --> 02:47:52.240
Play as many different songs on different levels as you can.

02:47:52.240 --> 02:47:54.240
Exactly. Play songs you don't usually play.

02:47:54.240 --> 02:48:00.240
Every time you go to play 2DX, make your last song something you've never played before that's about the same skill level, same star level.

02:48:00.240 --> 02:48:02.240
the same star level. That's the only way you're going to get better.

02:48:02.240 --> 02:48:06.720
I play things that are harder than you can do. I played the anothers and everything when

02:48:06.720 --> 02:48:11.180
I first started out, even though I couldn't even get too close to passing them, just to

02:48:11.180 --> 02:48:18.040
see them and try them out. Sooner or later you pass harder stuff.

02:48:18.040 --> 02:48:25.720
Alright, let's move on. Blarg says, who would you rather have sex with? An 80 year old in

02:48:25.720 --> 02:48:29.560
an 8-year-old's body or an 8-year-old in an 80-year-old's body?

02:48:29.560 --> 02:48:38.560
That's the point where I go to Goldie's. You know, actually, I don't have to worry about

02:48:38.560 --> 02:48:40.520
it. Yeah, yeah, you wouldn't have sex with a lady

02:48:40.520 --> 02:48:44.040
anyway. Unless it was Margaret Cho.

02:48:44.040 --> 02:48:48.880
I would with Margaret Cho. Would you rather have sex with an 8-year-old

02:48:48.880 --> 02:48:51.640
in an 80-year-old's body or an 80-year-old in an 8-year-old's body?

02:49:21.640 --> 02:49:26.100
Would you rather play ball in a field that has short grass or a field that's just like

02:49:26.100 --> 02:49:33.800
turned to dust? Okay, I mean. Like, you're gonna have an unexperienced old chick, that's

02:49:33.800 --> 02:49:40.000
just nasty. I mean, I'm sorry. But, if you think about it, not only are you robbing the

02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:45.840
cradle but you're fucking getting some older action at the same time. So it's like, it's

02:49:45.840 --> 02:49:46.840
wrong.

02:49:46.840 --> 02:49:51.960
Topic change real quick DJ Rama has says my question as I was rudely interrupted earlier tonight

02:49:51.960 --> 02:49:56.600
I missed half the show, but I could have sworn I heard or duo pump on pokal in

02:49:56.880 --> 02:50:03.320
Did I really hear that and where can I find that song? Yes, you did here or duro pomoklin and it is actually the version

02:50:03.320 --> 02:50:05.320
Let me play a little clip of that for you guys

02:50:07.860 --> 02:50:11.280
Yes, you did hear that and it's in DDR festival

02:50:11.280 --> 02:50:16.080
DER festival is one of the songs in there so pick up the festival soundtrack I guess

02:50:16.080 --> 02:50:20.500
if there is one. I don't think there is one yet. Or you can message Loki, he'll let you

02:50:20.500 --> 02:50:27.800
know where to find it. You have to find out DER UK, it's very hard to find them.

02:50:27.800 --> 02:50:33.280
Rob Maness also says Skye, similar stuff happens in the cosplay community, points to my posts

02:50:33.280 --> 02:50:37.800
in the chat. I missed it, I'm sorry buddy, you gotta send it over private message or

02:50:37.800 --> 02:50:48.540
I might miss it. What do you guys think about Song Pack 7,

02:50:48.540 --> 02:50:54.800
worth buying? Yes, because I think it should support DDR and it's just five bucks. That's

02:50:54.800 --> 02:51:00.100
like lunch at Burger King, it's not that bad. And the new remix is pretty kick ass and then

02:51:00.100 --> 02:51:06.080
you can play Era against me online and Era is a good song. If you honestly are just not

02:51:06.080 --> 02:51:09.860
into the remix. We played it for you guys later tonight. If you're just not feeling

02:51:09.860 --> 02:51:13.780
the iFeel remix, then I guess maybe there isn't a whole lot for you to gain from this,

02:51:13.780 --> 02:51:18.020
but I would say, you know what, buy it and just support DDR. Because the more people

02:51:18.020 --> 02:51:25.020
that buy song packs, yeah, this is what you get for coming late. There's a new iFeel remix.

02:51:25.020 --> 02:51:34.540
There's another iFeel, iFeel for being late. Alright. Okay, let's see. Illusion says, Jesus

02:51:34.540 --> 02:51:39.300
came to me and said he loved me so I kissed him. I would like to ask your opinion if that

02:51:39.300 --> 02:51:51.660
was too forward. Now does that make him gay or Jesus gay? Well maybe it was Jesus. I mean

02:51:51.660 --> 02:51:57.340
you know maybe it wasn't the Jesus. Maybe it was some guy named Jesus you know. And

02:51:57.340 --> 02:52:00.980
if he returned back to earth I think we have more things to worry about than your kiss.

02:52:00.980 --> 02:52:14.340
you know I think Jesus would have just said thank you and then ran away yeah he

02:52:14.340 --> 02:52:25.140
would forgive you for being a dirty homo sinner you would have inevitably undone

02:52:25.140 --> 02:52:29.460
humanity because Jesus would then go to hell for being gay and the sinner and

02:52:29.460 --> 02:52:36.460
And yeah, Earth would end and humanity would go away.

02:52:36.460 --> 02:52:37.460
Anyways.

02:52:37.460 --> 02:52:43.980
Well, we don't have any more questions from our chat room, oh no, I think we just got

02:52:43.980 --> 02:52:44.980
another one.

02:52:44.980 --> 02:52:49.860
But I am going to open up the Skype line here over on, excuse me, www.orangelandtrader.com,

02:52:49.860 --> 02:52:51.300
click on interact with us.

02:52:51.300 --> 02:52:58.780
DarkTetsuya says, I've been trying to dig up info on KR, Konami version, the karaoke

02:52:58.780 --> 02:53:02.580
karaoke revolution konami version, but I only saw the small snippet on konami's site. Is

02:53:02.580 --> 02:53:07.980
that all the info that's out there? Yes, I have only been hearing about this second-hand

02:53:07.980 --> 02:53:12.780
kind of through Navi, the pop music whore, he's been kind of following this. From what

02:53:12.780 --> 02:53:18.940
I understand, there is going to be a karaoke revolution Bamani version, not in the U.S.,

02:53:18.940 --> 02:53:25.700
okay, it's a Japanese mix, and I guess it's just going to be something that is happening,

02:53:25.700 --> 02:53:29.200
we don't know a whole lot about that, but there was questionnaires that happened already,

02:53:29.200 --> 02:53:35.020
and folks could fill out those questionnaires, but that's all we know, right now. So, there's

02:53:35.020 --> 02:53:39.060
nothing else we know that's going on with the Bomani edition as far as I know.

02:53:39.060 --> 02:53:45.420
It's all about naha naha gachikun battle. That needs to be on there in duet mode. That

02:53:45.420 --> 02:53:52.540
would be fucking awesome. No, but, you know what's cool? I'm eating gummy bears right

02:53:52.540 --> 02:53:59.040
Now the fun thing you can do about these, you can bite them in half and lick one end of it, and stick it to stuff, and it'll stick there for a long time.

02:53:59.040 --> 02:54:06.540
And if you stick it to someone's back window and they don't notice it, and when they try to peel it off, it's all slimy because of all the mildew- you know, the moist air outside.

02:54:06.540 --> 02:54:07.540
It's really fun to do.

02:54:09.540 --> 02:54:11.540
So bite a gummy bear in half, stick it to your friend...

02:54:13.540 --> 02:54:15.040
How is that for random?

02:54:16.540 --> 02:54:17.540
Wow.

02:54:18.540 --> 02:54:19.540
Very interesting.

02:54:19.540 --> 02:54:24.940
Sigh. I guess it's time to start wrapping up this show you guys, the show's just about-

02:54:24.940 --> 02:54:27.540
And rubbings and booze. And balls.

02:54:27.540 --> 02:54:38.540
Oh, oh, oh. Angel reminded me of something. Not so subtly. Okay, this is something I wanted to bring- I wanted to bring this up like in the first hour of the show and I totally forgot. Angel went and got a happy meal at McDonald's today.

02:54:38.540 --> 02:54:39.540
I was hungry, you idiot!

02:54:39.540 --> 02:54:40.540
What?

02:54:40.540 --> 02:54:41.540
I was hungry.

02:54:41.540 --> 02:54:44.540
There's no shame in a happy meal at the- at the happy meals.

02:54:44.540 --> 02:54:45.540
There's no shame at all.

02:54:45.540 --> 02:54:48.540
I saw Sonic and I'm like, hmm, maybe it's a figurine!

02:54:48.540 --> 02:54:53.020
game! Yeah, exactly. It's a Sonic Happy Meal. I guess they teamed up with Sonic the Hedgehog

02:54:53.020 --> 02:54:57.340
to do these Sonic Happy Meals at McDonald's right now. Look at this! She got a free little

02:54:57.340 --> 02:55:02.020
game with hers. Like, these are the kind of games like Mr. Game & Watch. Tiger Toys! Yeah,

02:55:02.020 --> 02:55:05.500
the Tiger Toys. You remember these? These used to be the things we would get for Christmas.

02:55:05.500 --> 02:55:09.980
These shitty little, like, watch games that we would get for Christmas as a kid. And now

02:55:09.980 --> 02:55:13.940
they're coming in freaking Happy Meals, and it's a little Sonic one, and it's basically

02:55:13.940 --> 02:55:19.600
a ghetto version of the bonus stage from Sonic 2. But, my God, this is a Happy Meal toy.

02:55:19.600 --> 02:55:24.340
I remember when we used to get shitty little wind-up toys and, like, little plushy things

02:55:24.340 --> 02:55:29.980
and fucking Beanie Babies with Happy Meals. And now we get freaking video games with Sonic?

02:55:29.980 --> 02:55:33.780
And when did Sonic start making a comeback in the U.S.? That's the other thing. Well,

02:55:33.780 --> 02:55:36.860
I guess I've just been asleep. Yeah, that's right, he's got the cartoon. Okay, so I've

02:55:36.860 --> 02:55:40.620
just been asleep. That's fine. I mean, Sonic's cool and all, so I'm glad that they're doing

02:55:40.620 --> 02:55:45.300
a happy meal thing but man you get a freaking game like this is the kind of

02:55:45.300 --> 02:55:48.300
stuff we would open up on Christmas Day and be excited about and now you get it

02:55:48.300 --> 02:55:51.780
in a freaking happy meal what's up with that

02:55:55.260 --> 02:55:58.140
is there something wait is there something you want to add to that Jamie

02:55:58.140 --> 02:56:07.540
you're a sonic fan is this is this cool I understand how cool the free iPod

02:56:07.540 --> 02:56:09.540
Don't start a threat about it!

02:56:09.540 --> 02:56:17.660
god people they're giving them away for free does that tell you anything about

02:56:17.660 --> 02:56:22.960
how crappy they are they're free they can toss them away

02:56:22.960 --> 02:56:29.520
sad I love my iPod you shut your mouth we had a rap with the show boys and

02:56:29.520 --> 02:56:36.220
girls next week on the show more randomness um in two weeks I'm gonna be

02:56:36.220 --> 02:56:40.740
going to AI, Arcade Infinity, I'm making an LA trip. I'm hoping! I may not get to go for

02:56:40.740 --> 02:56:44.760
sure, but that's kind of what I'm trying to do, is go to Arcade Infinity, um, probably

02:56:44.760 --> 02:56:48.500
next Thursday. Not this coming Thursday, but next Thursday. So, I hope to see some of you

02:56:48.500 --> 02:56:53.160
guys there, um, our stalker fans. That'll be fun. And my goal is to get a whole bunch

02:56:53.160 --> 02:56:57.500
of EMUs cards and get them away on the show to those less fortunate who can't get them.

02:56:57.500 --> 02:57:02.700
So, we'll see what happens with that. Um, anyway, next week on the show, more of the

02:57:02.700 --> 02:57:06.100
same stuff. I'm gonna try and line up an interview for next week's show. I want to interview

02:57:06.100 --> 02:57:10.040
somebody again. Hopefully a DDR artist, but maybe a DDR player if we can't get anything

02:57:10.040 --> 02:57:15.400
else. So, more to come on that. Stay tuned to our website over at oranassonsradio.com

02:57:15.400 --> 02:57:20.220
and stay tuned to our Live Gel community as well. Let's go around and get everybody's

02:57:20.220 --> 02:57:26.060
final thought. Starting off with Loki. I'm afraid to say it, but this is my last show

02:57:26.060 --> 02:57:31.620
that I'll be doing until next week. And, yeah, I gotta find something to do. I need to work

02:57:31.620 --> 02:57:36.100
in my cabin this week, for sure. Today, I mean, this week's gonna be a crazy week and

02:57:36.100 --> 02:57:40.300
my work's not gonna be too happy with me taking off another day on Thursday, but what the

02:57:40.300 --> 02:57:45.500
hell with him? Oh! Actually, the, ah, fuck, that sucks! I'm supposed to get my check on

02:57:45.500 --> 02:57:51.260
Tuesday. Oh, well, I'll have to wait. We get bonuses next week, so that's kind of cool.

02:57:51.260 --> 02:57:56.740
If I have to buy gifts, and I think Nellie wants diamonds again, you know, fucking women

02:57:56.740 --> 02:58:08.500
and their expensive gifts. Anyways, yeah, that's all. Next! Angel, your final thought.

02:58:08.500 --> 02:58:15.220
Brock's Candy Company needs to be sued. For? Making these things damn good. God. What a

02:58:15.220 --> 02:58:20.220
Maple Nut goodies. They're really good. They're very good. I've been snacking on them all

02:58:20.220 --> 02:58:21.220
night.

02:58:21.220 --> 02:58:23.220
Arcadia, on your final thought.

02:58:23.220 --> 02:58:24.220
Can you hear me?

02:58:24.220 --> 02:58:25.220
Yes.

02:58:25.220 --> 02:58:30.220
Oh, okay. I only had one piece of sushi last night. I need more! More sushi!

02:58:30.220 --> 02:58:35.220
I don't think Anita's listening anymore, but you need to go bang down her door.

02:58:35.220 --> 02:58:40.220
Well, somewhere. I don't really need her. Unless she wants to make some more. That'd

02:58:40.220 --> 02:58:41.220
be cool.

02:58:41.220 --> 02:58:42.220
Sushi from somewhere.

02:58:42.220 --> 02:58:43.220
Sushi's wonderful.

02:58:43.220 --> 02:58:44.220
Anywhere.

02:58:44.220 --> 02:59:10.500
I was thinking the other day, and this is very important, so everyone pay attention,

02:59:10.500 --> 02:59:19.820
We haven't done a Qzernite in a while. We need to do one again. So, check on the forums,

02:59:19.820 --> 02:59:25.580
or not the forums, but check on the live journal. There will be a new Qzernite, and we will

02:59:25.580 --> 02:59:31.620
reign supreme again! Alright, I'm dead. Uh, explicit your final thought.

02:59:31.620 --> 02:59:38.820
Well, if I wanted to get to work early, I should have just ran every fucking marathon

02:59:38.820 --> 02:59:45.820
Runner over GTA style.

03:00:08.820 --> 03:00:10.820
Good luck with those teriyaki, too.

03:00:10.820 --> 03:00:12.820
Yeah, we'll do that. We need to have a staff meeting.

03:00:12.820 --> 03:00:14.820
Staff meeting!

03:00:14.820 --> 03:00:16.820
Uh, DarkSakura, your final thought?

03:00:16.820 --> 03:00:18.820
I hate my allergies.

03:00:18.820 --> 03:00:21.820
I hate your allergies, too.

03:00:21.820 --> 03:00:23.820
My allergies hate you back, so yeah.

03:00:23.820 --> 03:00:25.820
Okay, cool.

Alright. Final word of the show tonight. I'll give it to Angel, why not?

Hanukkah is the festival of lights. Instead of one day of presents, we get eight presents.

03:01:20.820 --> 03:01:27.820

03:03:27.820 --> 03:03:33.820
So many Jews are in the show mitzvah

03:03:33.820 --> 03:03:38.820

03:03:39.820 --> 03:03:42.820
