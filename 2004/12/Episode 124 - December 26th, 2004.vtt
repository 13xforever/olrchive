04:27.220 --> 04:30.420
Actually, Jamie Summers is a little under the weather tonight.

04:30.420 --> 04:32.020
She's a little sick.

04:32.020 --> 04:34.120
She caught a Christmas bug.

04:34.120 --> 04:36.420
An elf bit her in the ass, and now she's sick.

04:36.420 --> 04:38.420
I don't know what happened, but...

04:38.420 --> 04:42.420
We hope you feel better soon, Ms. Dark Sakura.

04:49.200 --> 04:52.120

04:52.120 --> 04:54.740
See, you have food, so it's alright.

04:54.740 --> 04:57.640
Usually, I was going to cook before the show, but

04:57.640 --> 05:00.200
due to, um, you know,

05:00.200 --> 05:05.640
our, um, laying off of some extra staff members, um,

05:05.640 --> 05:07.400
we didn't have, you know,

05:07.400 --> 05:11.400
extra people. Well, usually, now Dark Sakura's the one that comes in here and she

05:11.400 --> 05:13.060
brings her big plate of meat

05:13.060 --> 05:15.260
and asparagus

05:15.260 --> 05:18.060
but i did shoot it snacking during the show i think you would do some laundry

05:18.060 --> 05:19.080
too

05:19.080 --> 05:22.560
but actually i do need to do a lot of you know

05:22.560 --> 05:25.940

05:25.940 --> 05:27.680
here even though she's not

05:27.680 --> 05:28.880
and on the laptop

05:28.880 --> 05:31.460

05:31.460 --> 05:35.380
without the with c there you go out to say we had a laptop we could play yes

05:35.380 --> 05:37.840
that would be pretty close

05:37.840 --> 05:40.140
i'm just getting actually not even similar at all

05:40.140 --> 05:44.200
uh... also joining us tonight then since um...

06:05.460 --> 06:12.460
to start sacrosanct, and you know that since she's sick, she's extra angry. So, you know,

06:12.880 --> 06:19.880
we've got all that extra anger right here in a little body we call Darkchild. Anyway,

06:21.560 --> 06:25.840
it should be an interesting show tonight. I really have no idea what's going to happen.

06:25.840 --> 06:29.880
I notice our listenership is down a little bit, probably because you guys are away for

06:29.880 --> 06:35.400
the holidays doing your holiday thing fine see if we care guys have your

06:35.400 --> 06:39.760

07:07.680 --> 07:09.680

07:10.080 --> 07:16.760
Whatever gets us out there and gets us attention whether it be on orange lounge radio or TDR freak radio

07:16.840 --> 07:20.640
Who cares because isn't attention whoring what it's really all about

07:21.680 --> 07:23.680
Yeah, yeah, all right

07:23.680 --> 07:37.680
So whatever, we'll try and make do anyway. I'm sure we have a lot of folks who want to talk about their Christmas, and want to talk about New Year's coming up, want to talk about Tsunamis in China, I don't know.

07:37.680 --> 07:40.680
Fuck all that. Life sucks.

07:40.680 --> 07:49.680
Or maybe, let's just have a giant pity party, because isn't that what Orange Lounge is all about anyway? Just feeling sorry for ourselves.

07:49.680 --> 07:52.680
I have cheese.

07:52.680 --> 07:57.680

Just standing there with your arms folded like you couldn't care

11:47.680 --> 11:53.680
Even before you glanced at me, I already felt the chemistry

11:53.680 --> 11:59.680
Don't know what it is about you that's got me feeling mesmerized

11:59.680 --> 12:05.680
I won't let you get away boy, you're the lucky one

12:05.680 --> 12:09.680
I don't need you cause the truth is

12:09.680 --> 12:18.680
Got my hands full of faggots But I want you, gonna put you at the very, very top of my list

12:18.680 --> 12:48.240
I don't need you, cuz the truth is, got my hands full of fattening

12:48.240 --> 12:54.240
But I want you, gonna put you at the very, very top of my list

12:54.240 --> 13:01.240
Yeah, I want you, gonna have you, and that's the way it is

13:06.240 --> 13:11.240
Hello? Hello, is this thing on? Testing? Testing 1-2?

13:11.240 --> 13:16.240
I'm looking in the index, but I don't see anything for how to run a radio show

13:16.240 --> 13:19.240
Hello? I don't understand this.

13:19.240 --> 13:20.240
Does this thing work?

13:20.240 --> 13:21.240
This thing reads like stereo instructions!

13:21.240 --> 13:22.240
Is this on?

13:22.240 --> 13:23.240
What the hell?

13:25.240 --> 13:29.240
Orange Lounge Radio, broke down ghetto bimani radio.

13:29.240 --> 13:30.240
What the f***?

13:31.240 --> 13:35.240
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, the lovely dark sacra making an appearance in that promo.

13:35.240 --> 13:37.240
Even though she's out tonight, she's feeling ill.

13:38.240 --> 13:41.240
Yes siree, she's in that promo there with that other guy.

13:41.240 --> 13:45.240
We are here on Orange Lounge Radio episode number 124.

13:45.240 --> 13:50.840
I noticed our chat room is just kind of bouncing there or chatting away talking so you can go join him at

13:51.200 --> 13:54.360
www.orangelandtrader.com click on chat and of course

13:56.240 --> 14:01.960
Skypline which will certainly probably have to make some use out of tonight because we have very limited talent here in the studio tonight

14:02.440 --> 14:05.280
Especially with Jamie being gone. Well there went all the talent so

14:06.280 --> 14:11.760
We're really screwed now, so we'll probably be relying on you guys a little bit, but that's alright

14:11.760 --> 14:14.760
It's good when we get a chance to sit down and talk to our listeners a bit

14:14.760 --> 14:19.840
So hope all you guys out there had a happy holidays. It is December 26. It's the day after Christmas

14:20.720 --> 14:26.600
So today is the day that everybody's out at the stores and they're spending their gift certificates and you know trying to you know

14:26.600 --> 14:29.400
Spend all their Christmas money and things like that trying to buy things

14:29.400 --> 14:34.600
So I hope for those of you that decided to go shopping today you were able to find those things that you wanted

14:34.600 --> 14:40.960
I know that we had our own experience over at our local Best Buy, but there's kind of a backstory to this you see

14:40.960 --> 14:44.840
basically what happened this week is that you know I was playing a little bit

14:44.840 --> 14:49.200
of computer games and stuff and I was leaning back on my chair and my fat ass

14:49.200 --> 14:54.920
broke my own chair so here I was without a chair on Christmas Eve nowhere to go

14:54.920 --> 14:57.640
after six o'clock on Christmas Eve so I couldn't place the chair on Christmas

14:57.640 --> 15:01.960
Eve so I can replace it on Christmas Day so my back is starting to hurt after a

15:01.960 --> 15:05.320
while I could still sit in my chair but I couldn't lean back like if I would

15:05.320 --> 15:08.840
lean back I'd fall on the floor so I had to wait till today to go out and get a

15:08.840 --> 15:13.140
new chair so I decided to break Best Buy today and Loki said hey you know I'll go

15:13.140 --> 15:16.880
too because what is it you got for Christmas what like I have too many gift

15:16.880 --> 15:19.860
cards that cannot close my wallet because of all the gift cards so it's

15:19.860 --> 15:23.420
trying to get rid of the gift cards at Best Buy how many how much money did you

15:23.420 --> 15:27.080
have for Best Buy $50 those don't know what Best Buy I think Best Buy is a

15:27.080 --> 15:30.380
nationwide thing right they haven't yeah all right well if you don't have one in

15:30.380 --> 15:34.180
your neck of the woods basically huge electronics store DVDs movies CDs all

15:34.180 --> 15:37.520
that stuff which we really shouldn't name these things by name because they're

15:37.520 --> 15:42.540
paying us advertising dollars but it's like it's like Circuit City but blue

15:42.540 --> 15:47.180
okay fair enough we're not really endorsing them either we're just saying

15:47.180 --> 15:50.020
we went there because we had kids certificates and I needed to chair and I

15:50.020 --> 15:55.740
knew they sold chairs so anyway went over to Best Buy and holy crap was the

15:55.740 --> 15:59.820
line long at Best Buy I mean it was going it looked like it was the day

15:59.820 --> 16:03.700
before Christmas that's how they do the lines now it was crazy but I mean it was

16:03.700 --> 16:07.280
a long long line it was like practically it started to go it was going back and

16:07.280 --> 16:11.840
was going, like, around the corner. No, they set up a queue now, just like, um, Fry's has.

16:11.840 --> 16:15.320
Right. Now, I know they don't have Fry's everywhere. They have it all mostly on the West Coast,

16:15.320 --> 16:19.560
but I don't think they have it everywhere. I think so, yeah. So, basically, the Lion's

16:19.560 --> 16:23.720
Lawn at Best Buy, so I know a lot of people are out there shopping today. My fat ass broke

16:23.720 --> 16:27.800
that chair, but that's okay, it was kind of a shitty chair anyway, it was a $20 Walmart

16:27.800 --> 16:31.360
chair, that's what I get for shopping at Walmart, basically, so I had to step it up anyway,

16:31.360 --> 16:36.560
I needed to buy a nicer chair. And I feel, might I say, I feel quite proud of myself,

16:36.560 --> 16:43.360
because I built this chair. That's right, this chair did not come pre-assembled, so

16:43.360 --> 16:48.360
I had to get out the instruction manual, which I'll tell ya, not written in this country,

16:48.360 --> 16:51.880
because they have to draw pictures to make sense of everything.

16:51.880 --> 16:56.320
He first thought the instruction manual was not included until I later found it attached

16:56.320 --> 17:00.520
to the chair. Shut up. You don't have to bring that shit up, alright?

17:00.520 --> 17:07.200
So finally, we discovered the instruction manual, which was poorly placed inside of

17:07.200 --> 17:12.720
the box somewhere, and I put it together. I put this whole chair together. I was very

17:12.720 --> 17:17.560
happy. Oh, Loki helped with one part, but, you know, that doesn't matter. So I'm very

17:17.560 --> 17:23.040
proud of my handiwork, and I feel like a man today. I've become a man today. I've built

17:23.040 --> 17:27.920
my own chair. It was kind of like, you know what, it was like Legos. I think that's why

17:27.920 --> 17:34.480
we play with Legos as a kid, because you know I have to follow the Legos as a kid? Or now,

17:34.480 --> 17:40.880
for some of you guys. When you're building Legos, they don't tell you how to do it, you

17:40.880 --> 17:44.640
have to follow the little pictures. That's what it's doing, it's prepping you for what

17:44.640 --> 17:47.560
the real world's going to be like when you have to build these chairs. If you're ever

17:47.560 --> 17:51.560
going to shop at IKEA, basically, you better know how to put Legos together, because that's

17:51.560 --> 17:54.440
the kind of instructions you're going to have to follow. So I'm very proud of myself for

17:54.440 --> 18:00.640
building this chair, and only one screw is a little loose, so hopefully I'll be okay.

18:00.640 --> 18:09.640
Wow, the chair is just a metaphor of the show. Hopefully my fat ass doesn't break this chair

18:09.640 --> 18:14.720
too, we'll see. And I'll tell you, after Christmas I feel fat, but we'll get into that later.

18:14.720 --> 18:18.400
I want to answer a few questions that are coming in from the chat room tonight. Jaded2004

18:18.400 --> 18:24.120
before asks, where's the webcam? You guys notice www.orangehelter.com, no webcam tonight.

18:24.120 --> 18:29.880
Well, basically here it is. It's just me, it's just Loki, it's just Dark Child. We're

18:29.880 --> 18:36.280
all ugly, so we don't need to be on the webcam. Well, I can turn on the webcam, but you just

18:36.280 --> 18:40.560
have a picture of the empty couch. Basically, if you were to turn on the webcam, all you

18:40.560 --> 18:44.960
would see is the gigantic box that my chair came in, which I don't know how the chair

18:44.960 --> 18:49.480
comes in a ginormous box like that and isn't pre-assembled. And then you see all the wrapping

18:49.480 --> 18:54.920
paper and just stuff strewn all about, this post-Christmas chaos we have going on. But

18:54.920 --> 18:59.760
there's nobody sitting over there with a webcam. You guys bitch all the time. The webcam angle

18:59.760 --> 19:04.320
is horrid. So maybe we'll move the webcam later. We'll try to point it over here. No.

19:04.320 --> 19:08.560
But you see, it's too big of a pain in the ass. Because of this cabinet that Loki has,

19:08.560 --> 19:13.520
the cabinet of death thing that he's got going on, it's too hard to change. I have to unlock

19:13.520 --> 19:17.600
the little coin door. I have to go and I have to turn on the power. Then I have to switch

19:17.600 --> 19:22.920
over the, um, video input to make sure it's a TV, otherwise you get no video. Then once

19:22.920 --> 19:27.080
I do that, then I have to start up the Playstation 2. I have to switch over the video to that.

19:27.080 --> 19:31.800
Then I have to start itoyplay. Once I get itoyplay going, then I have to sub to itoy

19:31.800 --> 19:35.560
in a well-lit area. So that means I have to adjust the lighting as well. Thank you. It's

19:35.560 --> 19:39.900
just too much damn work, Baseless World War Town 2. And consider we have half the listeners,

19:39.900 --> 19:44.360
we usually have F you. We're not going to set up the webcam. No, I'm kidding. We love

19:44.360 --> 19:48.840
you guys who are here tonight on your vacation listening. Love you.

19:48.840 --> 19:53.400
Just stare hard enough at the web page, you'll eventually see us. Trust me.

19:53.400 --> 19:58.160
You know what? Here, this is an excellent opportunity for you to visit our picture galleries.

19:58.160 --> 19:59.160
Exactly.

19:59.160 --> 20:04.680
And you can see, see this is how you promote, you cross promote your other productions.

20:04.680 --> 20:09.160
This is, you visit our picture gallery on the website and you can see pictures of us

20:09.160 --> 20:14.080
at E3 smiling back at you. And you can eat rice princesses in there and lanky stuff,

20:14.080 --> 20:18.920
seagirds in there, a kiriyamoka is in some of the pictures. So, you know what, if you're

20:18.920 --> 20:22.400
missing the webcam tonight, check out our ugly mugs in the picture gallery. And yes,

20:22.400 --> 20:26.680
for some reason, every single goddamn picture that is taken of me, I squint. And I don't

20:26.680 --> 20:36.040
know why. It's just, I squint. My eyes are sensitive or something. Now, Misty's offering

20:36.040 --> 20:40.620
financial compensation now for you to go through. I still don't understand why they want a webcam

20:40.620 --> 20:44.880
pointed at nothingness, but maybe we could just turn on the TV. We could just put a cartoon

20:44.880 --> 20:45.880
on.

20:45.880 --> 20:46.880
I'll turn on the webcam.

20:46.880 --> 20:47.880
There you go.

20:47.880 --> 20:48.880
God.

20:48.880 --> 20:51.200
We could just point, you know, we could just turn the TV on Cartoon Network.

20:51.200 --> 20:53.040
I'll just go sit at the chair.

20:53.040 --> 20:54.040
There you go.

20:54.040 --> 20:55.040
Darkchild, you could just...

20:55.040 --> 20:56.040
They could watch me sit.

20:56.040 --> 21:03.520
There you go. You'll just, you can model. At least they're not requesting nude modeling

21:03.520 --> 21:05.120
tonight. Be thankful for that.

21:05.120 --> 21:07.640
Fuck it, I'd do it.

21:07.640 --> 21:10.840
You're just in one of those moods.

21:10.840 --> 21:12.720
It's that time of the month.

21:12.720 --> 21:13.900
Alright, well,

21:13.900 --> 21:17.200
we need to get into a little bit of how was your week, how was your day, where we're going to talk about

21:17.200 --> 21:19.280
how our week was and how our day was.

21:19.280 --> 21:22.640
And I know that there was Halloween going on.

21:22.640 --> 21:28.280
Or Halloween.

21:28.280 --> 21:31.640
It's going to be one of those.

21:31.640 --> 21:35.160
you know what though if your house is like my house at all maybe it felt like

21:35.160 --> 21:38.280
halloween to you

21:38.280 --> 21:42.140
things were a little bit scary, yes you did get death for christmas from uh...

21:42.140 --> 21:44.880
who got that, that was dark child that got that for you

21:44.880 --> 21:50.240
the death doll right so maybe it was halloween for some it feels like halloween to me

21:50.240 --> 21:52.680
trick or treat

21:52.680 --> 21:56.300
give me money

21:56.300 --> 22:00.460
dark child we'll start with you my friend since jamie usually starts us off and

22:00.460 --> 22:04.100
she's not here tonight, and you're sort of filming it. How was your week? How was your day?

22:04.100 --> 22:08.420
Where to start? My week was the worst week. Remember,

22:08.420 --> 22:12.540
it's a three-hour show. Yes, yes, I know, I know. My week was the worst week

22:12.540 --> 22:15.700
ever. I have moved back home

22:15.700 --> 22:19.180
to my mother's house north of Sacramento, and I was hoping to

22:19.180 --> 22:23.340
continue changing things for me and Anita to be together,

22:23.340 --> 22:27.260
make things better, you know. Guys fuck up, and we need to change a lot, and

22:27.260 --> 22:29.260
It usually takes us a long time to figure it out.

22:29.260 --> 22:33.260
Well, I get back and she no longer wants to be with me.

22:33.260 --> 22:35.260
So, yeah, weeks sucked.

22:35.260 --> 22:39.260
I spent the rest of the week staying at my mom's house on the ranch doing nothing but

22:39.260 --> 22:43.260
writing in a little book and sitting in the trailer since I'm not welcomed in the house.

22:43.260 --> 22:44.260
Do you get to ride horsies?

22:44.260 --> 22:46.260
No, I'm not allowed to ride the horses.

22:46.260 --> 22:47.260
No horsies?

22:47.260 --> 22:48.260
No horsies.

22:48.260 --> 22:51.260
The dogs at the house get better privileges than I do.

22:51.260 --> 22:56.860
So, yeah, my Christmas came, and my brother comes up with his fiancé, which made life

22:56.860 --> 22:58.260
more difficult for me.

22:58.260 --> 23:04.340
And we had the usual family argument, which ended up being resolved by us going outside

23:04.340 --> 23:05.340
and smoking some butt.

23:05.340 --> 23:08.340
Orange Arms did not support the spoken butt.

23:08.340 --> 23:09.340
Today.

23:09.340 --> 23:10.340
Today.

23:10.340 --> 23:15.180
And, you know, I had dinner with my family.

23:15.180 --> 23:16.180
You know what, though?

23:16.180 --> 23:19.460
Now that I think about it, it would make this show a lot better.

23:19.460 --> 23:20.460
I'm kidding.

23:20.460 --> 23:27.460
kids, say no to drugs. Alright. Until you're 21. Um, so yeah, that was my week and my day.

23:28.540 --> 23:35.540
Today I hung out with Dream Pixie and her boyfriend and just talked about stuff. The

23:36.740 --> 23:42.280
Orange Lounge, madam! Where the fuck is she? She was supposed to be here tonight. She,

23:42.280 --> 23:47.240
she decided that she wanted to go to Hayward with her man, so... Fired! She'll be back

23:47.240 --> 23:52.840
Tuesday though oh well great she can go guest on Jamie's show cuz you know we

23:52.840 --> 23:58.520
don't do a show here on Tuesdays all right whatever I see how it is I see how

23:58.520 --> 24:02.340
it is but uh deep dickings are more important than Orange Lounge I

24:02.340 --> 24:08.120
understand I'm not getting deep-dicking here maybe later if you're good okay

24:08.120 --> 24:14.040
all right but uh yeah that was my week in my day all right well sorry to hear

24:14.040 --> 24:18.220
of the holidays were not that exciting, but you know what? Sometimes that's what the holidays

24:18.220 --> 24:23.720
are for, is for us to just... I really don't know where I'm going with this thought.

24:23.720 --> 24:29.120
Feel like shit because you realize that a big fat man in a red coat's not real?

24:29.120 --> 24:31.880
Don't tell... We have children that listen to this show.

24:31.880 --> 24:35.080
Santa is fake, so is the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy.

24:35.080 --> 24:43.960
You're just breaking little kids' dreams everywhere. Although part of me is tempted to go to golf

24:43.960 --> 24:51.560
plan and announce that over the loudspeaker. Attention children, get off my DDR machine.

24:51.560 --> 24:56.240
Santa Claus does not exist. Okay, now I see Loki with his thinking face over there and

24:56.240 --> 25:03.060
I know what he's thinking. Let me think. How could I patch in to the Roosevelt-Goughland

25:03.060 --> 25:08.320
sound speaker system to make all the announcements I want? That's not what I'm thinking. What

25:08.320 --> 25:12.880
I'm thinking is, with the portable PC they'll have, which we'll be able to, you know, record

25:12.880 --> 25:17.600
to for E3 and stuff, you could put like some external speakers running off the same battery

25:17.600 --> 25:23.720
power and turn those up really loud and it'd be like your own portable boombox system.

25:23.720 --> 25:28.680
That's so, remember the early 90s, remember those old rap videos, you know, where they

25:28.680 --> 25:33.600
would carry the boombox on their shoulder like, you know, with the loud music playing,

25:33.600 --> 25:39.000
you know, and all the rap videos and the colorful getup they'd have. You're almost describing

25:39.000 --> 25:43.160
that exact same thing, except now it's like gone totally nerd-dom, where now you'll have

25:43.160 --> 25:50.440
the big PC sitting on your shoulder. Attention, Gulf Land children, there is no Santa Claus.

25:50.440 --> 25:59.000
Enjoy your day. Your parents have been lying to you for years. The only reason your parents

25:59.000 --> 26:02.520
brought you here is so that they don't have to listen to you for an hour, so they can

26:02.520 --> 26:11.800
some peace and quiet, and possibly do it in the bathroom! Have a happy holiday! Ho, ho,

26:11.800 --> 26:20.160
ho! Loki, how was your week in your day? I sent him the webcam. He sent him the webcam.

26:20.160 --> 26:31.280
Take a break from the webcam. No, I have to fix webcam. Anyways, my week in day, my week

26:31.280 --> 26:36.880
was boring it was really busy then it got really dead and then we went and saw

26:36.880 --> 26:41.920
the Phantom of the Opera that was okay and I got lots of shirts and gift cards

26:41.920 --> 26:50.020
and played lots of Final Fantasy made fried rice that's about it that fried

26:50.020 --> 26:55.600
rice was good by the way very good delicious you should be an Iron Chef

26:55.600 --> 26:59.680
right between you and Jamie I'm set when it comes to this show because I can't

26:59.680 --> 27:04.400
cook for shit but Jamie cooks really well and Loki cooks really well and

27:04.400 --> 27:09.160
heaven I think that should be a requirement to continue being a co-host

27:09.160 --> 27:14.480
of the shows that you should cook for me every week and in return I will bring

27:14.480 --> 27:23.100
you my presence I brought you Puerto Rican sausage I'm vegetarian it's okay

27:23.100 --> 27:31.020
you don't have to swallow all right anyway my week in my day my week was

27:31.020 --> 27:35.860
pretty unexciting I mean work and we got off work early it did karaoke on

27:35.860 --> 27:40.580
Thursday which was exciting got to stay long enough to see some strippers which

27:40.580 --> 27:46.060
were really ugly so we decided to leave yeah they're really ugly so we left

27:46.060 --> 27:50.500
early Christmas was okay I got money which is a good thing money is always

27:50.500 --> 27:56.420
good and I got a really ugly sweater, which, you know, I'm always thankful for that.

27:56.420 --> 28:00.780
Let's see, what else happened? Oh, I went and saw Phantom of the Opera, also at the

28:00.780 --> 28:05.500
movie theater because it was playing. It's tradition in our family that we always go

28:05.500 --> 28:09.900
and see a movie on Christmas. It's like, okay, we eat, then we open all the presents, then

28:09.900 --> 28:12.860
we go and we go to a movie. So we went and saw Phantom of the Opera because that's what

28:12.860 --> 28:17.680
my mom wanted to see. And it was a good movie! I cried like a little girl and it was a very

28:17.680 --> 28:23.860
gay film, so I was quite pleased with it. It was good. I recommend it. Thumbs up if

28:23.860 --> 28:27.940
you want to go see Phantom of the Opera. Although it was a little long. It was kind of long.

28:27.940 --> 28:32.060
But I've seen the stage play a couple times, and there were some things about the stage

28:32.060 --> 28:35.900
play. I don't know if it translated very well to screen, but overall it was well acted and

28:35.900 --> 28:41.540
all that fun stuff. Oh, you changed the angle of the cam, I see. Oh. Well, great. Wow. You

28:41.540 --> 28:45.220
guys really owe Loki for this one. He went up there and changed the angle of the cam

28:45.220 --> 28:50.260
completely so that you can see us in our little corner. And you can see what a dump my workstation

28:50.260 --> 28:56.980
is. Oh well, that's alright. I don't care. I build a chair. Everything else can go to

28:56.980 --> 28:59.620
hell. Alright, so that was pretty much my week and my day.

28:59.620 --> 29:06.980
Yeah. Okay. Anything else exciting happen on your Christmas? That was it? You seemed

29:06.980 --> 29:12.420
like you were gone a lot this week. Well, no, I was only gone like a few days.

29:12.420 --> 29:19.860
Like Christmas Eve, hung out at my parents' house on Christmas Day when I hung out at

29:19.860 --> 29:23.340
my parents' house because my grandparents were over.

29:23.340 --> 29:26.380
That's pretty much all I did, really.

29:26.380 --> 29:30.140
Oh, I have 100 stars now in Mario 64.

29:30.140 --> 29:31.140
Thank you!

29:31.140 --> 29:36.220
That's a lot of downtime waiting for parties in Final Fantasy.

29:36.220 --> 29:37.220
Now here we go.

29:37.220 --> 29:39.820
There's an idea for what we could do with the show tonight, because Jamie's not here.

29:39.820 --> 29:46.820
just have Final Fantasy XI chat tonight. I don't play FF11 anymore. You used to? I don't

29:46.820 --> 29:50.300
play any games anymore. Weren't you playing World of Warcraft for a while there? You were

29:50.300 --> 29:53.900
beta. Yeah, I was in the beta for like seven months. Everybody's freaking ditching Final

29:53.900 --> 29:57.780
Fantasy XI to go World of Warcraft, but you know what? Don't. They're coming back. Oh

29:57.780 --> 30:03.440
yeah. Oh, you didn't enjoy World of Warcraft? I did, but it had problems, and when it came

30:03.440 --> 30:08.060
to release time, they still hadn't even worked out putting in talents for some of the classes,

30:08.060 --> 30:12.340
and other classes were just still too overly powerful, and other classes didn't do what

30:12.340 --> 30:16.300
they were supposed to do, and then somehow it went gold. So, it's gonna be like Star

30:16.300 --> 30:18.500
Wars Galaxy all over again. One year of paid beta.

30:18.500 --> 30:28.060
Alright. Fair enough. Welcome to your opinion. So yeah, Final Fantasy XI chat. No, I'm kidding.

30:28.060 --> 30:30.900
Actually, but you were saying something which I thought was kind of funny. You said something

30:30.900 --> 30:33.860
in chat before the show which I thought was really interesting. You were saying, you were

30:33.860 --> 30:39.620
were typing and you said, I keep wanting to type slash L before I type anything, but only

30:39.620 --> 30:45.740
my link shell will hear it. Now that's, that's the sign of too much Final Fantasy XI. And

30:45.740 --> 30:51.520
not in the chat room. Alright. Alright, we're going to go to a break you guys. When we come

30:51.520 --> 30:54.960
back from break, maybe we'll get to some Bahmani news. Maybe we'll take some calls on the Skype

30:54.960 --> 30:58.860
line. I want to hear about your guys' Christmas and how things are going, so go ahead and

30:58.860 --> 31:01.860
give us a call over there when we come back. If you don't know what I'm talking about when

31:01.860 --> 31:06.900
when I say the Skype line, head on over to www.orangelaungeradio.com and click on Interact

31:06.900 --> 31:11.620
with Us. We're going to be back after this break of music from 2DX tent style. We're

31:11.620 --> 31:14.260
kind of in a year-end show. This is going to be the last show of the year, if you can

31:14.260 --> 31:22.780
believe it, because the next show will be on... Sorry about that little bit of dead

31:22.780 --> 31:27.180
air there, guys. Sorry about that. Loki made a klutzy move and he unplugged our soundboard

31:27.180 --> 31:33.580
completely. Do not be alarmed, do not be alarmed. Anyway, yeah, we're getting towards the year-end

31:33.580 --> 31:37.900
show here, so we kind of want to start acknowledging those games that came out this year. We played

31:37.900 --> 31:41.820
a lot of songs during the pre-show. We've got some more songs for you, kind of the best

31:41.820 --> 31:45.980
of 2004 here. All right, we'll be back after this break, featuring some music from 2DX10

31:45.980 --> 31:48.980
We'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio after this.

32:15.980 --> 32:22.980
I'll see you in the next video.

33:45.980 --> 33:46.980
.

37:15.980 --> 37:22.980
And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio.

37:45.980 --> 37:51.980
staff meeting as they debate some of the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.

37:51.980 --> 37:56.980
Um, Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bamani Music & More program.

37:56.980 --> 37:57.980
Can we talk about that?

37:57.980 --> 37:59.980
No subject will ever be taboo.

37:59.980 --> 38:03.980
Well, I was thinking maybe we should move, pump up the volume from Tuesday nights?

38:03.980 --> 38:06.980
Except, of course, the subject that was just under discussion.

38:06.980 --> 38:12.980
Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?

38:12.980 --> 38:14.980
I collect your fucking head.

38:14.980 --> 38:27.980
Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki? The hollick thing on episode 69 was just a joke!

38:27.980 --> 38:34.980
Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!

38:34.980 --> 38:41.980
Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.

38:41.980 --> 38:45.980
Does anyone even know what the holic thing on episode 69 is anymore?

38:45.980 --> 38:47.980
I mean that was like a year ago

38:47.980 --> 38:52.980
More than a year ago, it was about a year and a few months ago

38:52.980 --> 38:56.980
I know some of our obsessive folks in the chatroom know, the folks that have been listening for forever

38:56.980 --> 39:01.980
But those of you that haven't been listening very long probably have no idea what they're talking about there

39:01.980 --> 39:05.980
That's right, ask Misty or Angel, one of those folks that would know about it

39:05.980 --> 39:08.980
Ask one of them to explain it to you, they'll be kind enough to do so

39:08.980 --> 39:12.860
All right, anyway, we are here on Orange Launch Radio.

39:12.860 --> 39:14.660
We do have an interesting circumstance tonight

39:14.660 --> 39:17.060
because Dark Sakura is not here.

39:17.060 --> 39:19.520
So usually we try to do something a little silly

39:19.520 --> 39:21.540
for the cage match when Dark Sakura isn't here.

39:21.540 --> 39:23.000
Like we do a reverse cage match,

39:23.000 --> 39:25.900
we do the karaoke cage match or something crazy.

39:25.900 --> 39:28.500
Loki's giving me that look of no karaoke cage match.

39:28.500 --> 39:29.820
That's fine.

39:29.820 --> 39:31.840
We don't have anybody, I mean, at least last time

39:31.840 --> 39:33.580
we had a guana girl here who can actually

39:33.580 --> 39:36.780
decently sing karaoke, so we had an excuse to do it.

39:36.780 --> 39:38.900
She's not here tonight, so we can't do that.

39:38.900 --> 39:42.980
So, we can't do the karaoke cage match. I don't really feel like doing a reverse cage

39:42.980 --> 39:48.340
match. Let's try, let's try a new idea. Here's my new idea. What, Darkchild?

39:48.340 --> 39:53.300
Are you saying that I can't sing? Well, I, okay, I guess Darkchild possibly

39:53.300 --> 39:58.540
could sing, but I'm not singing again, and neither is Loki. Yeah, tell, I can tell by

39:58.540 --> 40:01.500
the expression on his face. So we have to do something a little different with cage

40:01.500 --> 40:08.100
match tonight. So here it is. And you guys have been begging for this forever. So consider

40:08.100 --> 40:17.460
this your freaking Christmas present, alright? Well, we will allow a chat room choice, okay?

40:17.460 --> 40:21.460
So if you have an idea what song you would like to put in tonight's cage match, send

40:21.460 --> 40:28.180
me a private message right now with the song you would like to put in tonight's cage match.

40:28.180 --> 40:32.540
And we will pick one at random. Now you gotta be prepared, you might have to send me the

40:32.540 --> 40:36.140
song so don't name anything you don't have because you might have to send it to me, okay?

40:36.140 --> 40:38.780
So think about a song, think about it, don't just send the first thing that comes to your

40:38.780 --> 40:41.460
mind, think about a song you would like to hear in tonight's cage match, send it to me

40:41.460 --> 40:45.860
over a private message, Skye in the chat room, and we will have a chat room choice at tonight's

40:45.860 --> 40:50.720
cage match. And then, maybe you guys will stop complaining that our choices suck, because

40:50.720 --> 40:57.660
one of them will be yours. So, there you have it. Does that sound like a fair thing we can

40:57.660 --> 40:59.660
do to our, do for our listeners? I think so.

40:59.660 --> 41:00.660
Sounds fair.

41:00.660 --> 41:05.460
I think. Sounds very fair. No, you, well your song won, I will pick a new song and then

41:05.460 --> 41:09.860
we will have instead of Dark Sakura, because she's out tonight, we will have the Chatroom

41:09.860 --> 41:13.060
Choice as the third song. So, there you have it.

41:13.060 --> 41:17.920
Because Dark Child doesn't matter. Well, you matter! You still, now see, you

41:17.920 --> 41:20.500
still get to trash all three songs. Oh, true, true.

41:20.500 --> 41:24.220
So there you go. So don't worry, Dark Child, there's still

41:24.220 --> 41:29.060
a lot of love for you. Dark Child, for those that may not know you,

41:29.060 --> 41:33.500
you haven't been on the show in a little while, and, you know, we're syndicated over on DDR

41:33.500 --> 41:37.440
freak now, which has exposed ourselves to a whole new listener base, so some folks may

41:37.440 --> 41:42.620
not know who you are. So, tell us a little bit about yourself and your DDR history, because

41:42.620 --> 41:47.780
I know you go way back. I go way back. You go way back. How'd you get started playing

41:47.780 --> 41:54.300
DDR? I got started right when I got out of the military. My friend Ron worked at MVGO,

41:54.300 --> 42:03.340
or MGL. Yeah, MGL. MGL or Milpenis Golf Land. Yeah, Milpenis Golf Land. And he's like, hey

42:03.340 --> 42:06.740
dude, there's this cool new game that we're testing out here. You know, Milpenis gets

42:06.740 --> 42:12.180
a lot of test stuff. So he has me go to Golf Land, I see DDR, and my friend Rowan gets

42:12.180 --> 42:17.180
on. I'm like, whoa, that game looks like it's tight. So I try to play it. I suck. You know,

42:17.180 --> 42:21.060
I was barely able to get past Boom Boom Dollar because, you know, everyone passes Heavy Never

42:21.060 --> 42:27.540
been mellow this was 1.5 then it turns out that the guy to stand that play with

42:27.540 --> 42:32.000
us is a guy named Jim from Konami he was in charge of testing it for Konami so I

42:32.000 --> 42:36.240
played with you know the original test market here in the u.s. Wow okay and I

42:36.240 --> 42:42.780
got started playing right around the same time as Jason Co, Mel B, Jahi you

42:42.780 --> 42:46.180
know all them old-school the name-dropping love the name-dropping I

42:46.180 --> 42:52.700
I gotta drop it for him. But, you know, and Mike Noe, RTF, and I was also there for the

42:52.700 --> 42:58.700
DDR Freaklessness. I was there when Jason Coe and us came up with the idea for DDRFreak.com.

42:58.700 --> 43:04.420
So, I've been there from the beginning. Only SoCal people who played Imported DDR could

43:04.420 --> 43:05.940
say they've been playing longer than me.

43:05.940 --> 43:11.740
Oh, whipping out the DDR penis! Showing everyone right now how big it is.

43:11.740 --> 43:12.740
Ten inches.

43:12.740 --> 43:17.020
So, how many years does that make that you've been playing DDR? When was this? Is this 98?

43:17.020 --> 43:17.860
That was 98.

43:17.860 --> 43:18.460
Shit.

43:18.460 --> 43:22.780
And, uh, I haven't really been playing much anymore. I've been a big time judge the past few years.

43:22.780 --> 43:26.420
And I have a big tournament event coming up in September.

43:26.420 --> 43:28.540
Called the Max Games Tournament.

43:28.540 --> 43:30.580
Tell us about it. It's in September.

43:30.580 --> 43:34.940
In September, uh, this is going to be held at the San Jose Tech Museum.

43:34.940 --> 43:37.420
Sorry, I'm holding it too close.

43:37.420 --> 43:42.540
Alright, San Jose Tech Museum. And DDR will not be the only game there, but I will be

43:42.540 --> 43:46.800
be running the tournament for DDR, it'll be Perfect Attack and Freestyle, a weekend

43:46.800 --> 43:47.800
long event.

43:47.800 --> 43:53.120
There will also be a Halo 2 tournament, a bunch of other game tournaments on consoles.

43:53.120 --> 43:57.480
Red vs. Blue is going to show up and we're going to be airing Season 3 and possibly all

43:57.480 --> 44:03.200
of the seasons on the IMAX screen located at the Tech Museum, as well as BrickFlick.com

44:03.200 --> 44:05.960
will be having a video that we're creating currently.

44:05.960 --> 44:11.560
I'm a member of BrickFlick and we're going to be making a Lego video for the IMAX screen,

44:11.560 --> 44:16.040
And it's going to be a huge event, that's why we're planning ahead now for September.

44:16.040 --> 44:19.120
And also at the same time, Tech Museum will have a video game exhibit.

44:19.120 --> 44:20.120
Oh.

44:20.120 --> 44:24.040
So a huge history of video game thing going on at the museum the same weekend.

44:24.040 --> 44:26.800
We want to go hook us up with some media thing.

44:26.800 --> 44:28.640
Of course, I'll have a couple of VIP passes.

44:28.640 --> 44:29.640
Woo hoo!

44:29.640 --> 44:32.600
Get three, because there are three hosts here, all right.

44:32.600 --> 44:36.040
I want to clarify some things, because some folks in our chat room have some questions

44:36.040 --> 44:39.360
about the chat room choice for Cage Match tonight.

44:39.360 --> 44:42.000
know and you guys have been begging to do this for forever so I thought you

44:42.000 --> 44:45.540
already knew how it worked but that's no that's fine that's fine I realize it's

44:45.540 --> 44:49.440
been a while so I'll just remind you guys the way the cage match works is

44:49.440 --> 44:55.240
that we put three songs into rotation originally the concept was songs that

44:55.240 --> 44:59.640
aren't in a Bamani game that should be or sound like they belong in a Bamani

44:59.640 --> 45:04.400
game but they're not there yet so you know just upbeat happy dance songs but

45:04.400 --> 45:08.720
it kind of transformed itself into whatever is cool right now we've had

45:08.720 --> 45:14.720
We've had all sorts of cage match winners. We've had Bamani artists win with like Echo Image won before.

45:14.720 --> 45:20.720
We've had Top 40 artists win it. Gwen Stefani won. We've had songs from Overclocked in there.

45:20.720 --> 45:25.720
We've had songs that were theme songs to animes and stuff in there. All sorts of stuff.

45:25.720 --> 45:29.720
So, just whatever sounds good to you that you think is going to win it.

45:29.720 --> 45:32.720
I would love anyone who puts Slipknot in there.

45:32.720 --> 45:37.060
Jesus. Okay, we have to have some jurisdiction over this. Alright, anyway, now that we've

45:37.060 --> 45:41.720
clarified that, back to you for a minute. So, when did you, so you've been playing DDR

45:41.720 --> 45:49.840
since 98. When did you stop? I stopped playing right around, I'd say just after Third Mix

45:49.840 --> 45:53.240
came out. Which is about the time I started. Yeah, it's about the time a lot of people

45:53.240 --> 45:57.620
started because that's when it was hitting U.S. market. I moved up to Wheatland, which

45:57.620 --> 46:04.540
is north of Sacramento. Which is a little nothing hole in the world, yeah. And coming

46:04.540 --> 46:10.580
from MGL, we still thought there was no Sacto DDR. No, and there wasn't at the time, really.

46:10.580 --> 46:14.540
I didn't really play up here when I went down back to the Bay and I was trying fourth style

46:14.540 --> 46:19.800
and some of the hard songs on third style, I was way out of my league again. I saw Orochi

46:19.800 --> 46:23.760
sitting there, his feet flying all over the board on songs I couldn't even picture the

46:23.760 --> 46:29.540
arrows on. So that's when I kind of stopped playing, and started getting invited to judge

46:29.540 --> 46:31.600
a bunch of tournaments, so I've just been a judge since then.

46:31.600 --> 46:35.560
Oh, there you go. Now, okay, since you're a judge and you've judged a lot of tournaments,

46:35.560 --> 46:39.000
this is a good question, because we've got a lot of tournaments that have been going

46:39.000 --> 46:43.680
on lately coming up. What kind of shit do you look for in a routine? What makes a good

46:43.680 --> 46:48.320
freestyle DDR routine you? First off, I hate power moves after power

46:48.320 --> 46:53.000
move after power move. If it looks like your routine doesn't flow and you just, you know

46:53.000 --> 46:57.120
you could break, so you do breaking here, then there's a little pause of nothing, and

46:57.120 --> 47:00.080
then more breaking here, and then a pause, and it's just regular dancing, then more breaking,

47:00.080 --> 47:04.320
it's obvious you're just doing power moves to impress us, and a lot of judges don't like

47:04.320 --> 47:05.320
that.

47:05.320 --> 47:09.640
Another thing, if I've seen you up there before, it's really hard for people like Mel B to

47:09.640 --> 47:14.200
impress me, because I've seen a lot of his routines, and I always expect him to do something

47:14.200 --> 47:15.200
a little more.

47:15.200 --> 47:19.340
If I've seen you compete a lot of times, I'd like to see a different routine.

47:19.340 --> 47:22.140
So you think you're giving noobs a break a little bit?

47:22.140 --> 47:25.140
I think a little bit, because I haven't seen them in action.

47:25.140 --> 47:32.140
I've judged one or two tournaments, not a lot. I don't get asked to judge tournaments, because I guess I suck at DDR.

47:32.140 --> 47:40.140
But I don't always give newbies a break. I mean, I still expect that you better not be looking at the screen.

47:40.140 --> 47:42.140
Oh, definitely, definitely.

47:42.140 --> 47:44.140
You better look like you're having fun.

47:44.140 --> 47:49.740
But me personally, that's the number one bitch I have about freestyle routines, is that people

47:49.740 --> 47:52.780
look depressed while they dance.

47:52.780 --> 47:56.740
And I'm not saying you have to smile like a cheerleader when you play, but at least

47:56.740 --> 48:00.660
your expression should match the mood you're trying to convey with what you're doing.

48:00.660 --> 48:02.200
And I realize that sounds a little froofy.

48:02.200 --> 48:06.220
I think the best guy who shows his mood the best way would probably be Bruce Leroy on

48:06.220 --> 48:07.220
his routine.

48:07.220 --> 48:08.220
Absolutely.

48:08.220 --> 48:09.220
He's just glowing the whole time.

48:09.220 --> 48:10.220
One of the best.

48:10.220 --> 48:11.220
Absolutely.

48:11.220 --> 48:12.220
He always just carries it in his expressions.

48:12.220 --> 48:13.220
Yeah, definitely.

48:13.220 --> 48:16.560
got to look like you're having fun up there. If you look like you're bored and just doing

48:16.560 --> 48:19.000
something memorized, then you're going to get knocked down a bit.

48:19.000 --> 48:23.480
When you look bored, I hate that. I hate that more than anything, and I totally penalize.

48:23.480 --> 48:26.960
I mean, again, I haven't judged that many, but in the ones that I have, I totally would

48:26.960 --> 48:32.000
penalize people if they looked bored, because then I feel bored. Anyway, I'm sorry to interrupt.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.560
I went off on a date. It's supposed to be about you, not me. You just...

48:34.560 --> 48:38.000
And the last thing that I really look for in judging is make sure you actually have

48:38.000 --> 48:42.920
some kind of freestyle routine. Don't go up there and do a perfect attack, just stepping

48:42.920 --> 48:46.880
and getting the arrows all right. You know, you gotta do some kind of moves, try a move

48:46.880 --> 48:47.880
or something.

48:47.880 --> 48:51.200
Now, that used to be cool. Like, way back in the day, wasn't there somebody had done

48:51.200 --> 48:58.080
a paranoia, uh, rebirth routine, and it was basically kind of just backwards, memorized

48:58.080 --> 48:59.080
type thing?

48:59.080 --> 49:00.080
Yeah.

49:00.080 --> 49:01.080
It doesn't cut it anymore.

49:01.080 --> 49:02.080
Yeah, that was cool way back when.

49:02.080 --> 49:05.380
It was cool back in the day when nobody could pass a nine-footer, but let's face it. Everybody

49:05.380 --> 49:09.080
and their mothers passed Max 300 by now. Actually, that's still not true, because I still...

49:09.080 --> 49:10.080
Yeah, I haven't.

49:10.080 --> 49:16.160
I passed Max 300 once, but that's it. I mean, honestly, considering we've been doing this

49:16.160 --> 49:19.880
show for how long now you think that Loki, myself, and DarkSakurai would all actually

49:19.880 --> 49:27.080
be good DDR players, we're good, but we're not, you know, oh my God's triple A's on

49:27.080 --> 49:31.160
Legend of Max good, because we're all, unfortunately, we're old as well. We don't have the stamina

49:31.160 --> 49:32.160
you kids have.

49:32.160 --> 49:35.560
I find it funny some of the songs that people could pass now that I don't stand a chance

49:35.560 --> 49:41.040
on, yet I could still go back to a 1-5 machine and play Paranoia 180, the original one on

49:41.040 --> 49:46.520
Maniac, and some people still can't keep up with me on that song. But they kick my butt

49:46.520 --> 49:48.640
on all sorts of other songs on other machines.

49:48.640 --> 49:53.960
Because you take out the Vivid, and it's just, that, that, this is why Dark Sacra, she sits

49:53.960 --> 50:00.960
here and she always says, you know, back in my day, we had second mix, and we didn't have

50:00.960 --> 50:02.040
this Vivid stuff.

50:02.040 --> 50:05.640
Yeah, them different colored arrows? Oh, that's cheating, man.

50:05.640 --> 50:11.080
That's right. Gotta have the same flat color arrow coming up the screen.

50:11.080 --> 50:14.320
I still remember, I thought I was the shit the first time I played DDR because I

50:14.320 --> 50:16.740
passed a two-footer my first game.

50:16.740 --> 50:20.680
Wow. But that was because I played a ton of Bust-a-Groove. And so I already, you know, I kind of had an idea.

50:20.680 --> 50:24.440
I'd watched DDR, I'd kind of taken notes from a distance.

50:24.440 --> 50:28.100
But I remember, I remember, Alguana Girl and I played our very first game of DDR together.

50:28.100 --> 50:32.940
and look where she's at, and look where I'm at. She's the co-admin of a huge DDR forum, me.

50:32.940 --> 50:35.940
I got a shitty little internet show with two of my friends.

50:35.940 --> 50:43.940
Well, hey, I played with Jason Coe and helped him come up with DDR4.com. There you go, and now you're a guest on this shitty internet show!

50:43.940 --> 50:45.580
My how far we've come.

50:45.580 --> 50:48.360
I also remember playing back on 1.5,

50:48.360 --> 50:49.980
just trying to see what a maniac

50:49.980 --> 50:52.520
song looked like once we found the code. Did you say maniac?

50:52.520 --> 50:55.320
Yeah, I said maniac. She's a maniac, come on.

50:55.320 --> 50:58.320
but you know we figured out the maniac code i remember four of us getting on

50:58.320 --> 51:02.600
the machine tried to play one song on maniac each person added arrow

51:02.600 --> 51:06.060
and we still couldn't do it wait a minute i remember people doing that when max

51:06.060 --> 51:08.900
three hundred was new and people wanted to get extra or no

51:08.900 --> 51:10.560
no it was legend of max

51:10.560 --> 51:13.540
at what are not let him come to him it's

51:13.540 --> 51:15.560
what was the middle one what was the middle one

51:15.560 --> 51:17.080
max unlimited thank you

51:17.080 --> 51:19.840
because everybody was like oh my god kakumei right

51:19.840 --> 51:24.060
and so i remember watching this happen where everybody was on one arrow

51:24.060 --> 51:28.060
And they were doing this to get... It's just like on 2DX

51:28.060 --> 51:31.100
when people were trying to get the extra stage there, they would play doubles, but

51:31.100 --> 51:34.940
they'd have two people playing to make it easier.

51:34.940 --> 51:37.340
Just to hear that song.

51:37.340 --> 51:38.460
Just to get a glimpse.

51:38.460 --> 51:39.900
I've been judging ever since

51:39.900 --> 51:41.580
the way back when.

51:41.580 --> 51:43.420
You know, you might catch me at

51:43.420 --> 51:50.420
Golf Land or something playing every now and then, but it's nothing spectacular.

51:50.980 --> 51:53.580
So do you ever do PA at all?

51:53.580 --> 51:57.180
No, never were a PA. I'm a member of RTF.

51:57.180 --> 52:02.180
Oh, I didn't realize you were a member. Yeah, I became an honorary member of RTF

52:02.180 --> 52:07.180
and an honorary member of Step Squad. And then, of course, old school MGL.

52:07.180 --> 52:15.380
All right. So what do you think, since you're an old school

52:15.380 --> 52:19.460
member of all these clubs, what do you think of all these, it seems like everywhere I look

52:19.460 --> 52:23.240
there's a DDR club or a little DDR cult and I admit I've been just as bad

52:23.240 --> 52:27.240
because we had our own little DDR cold back in the day Sacramento everybody

52:27.240 --> 52:37.760
hated us I still don't know why we weren't you know for the longest time was

52:37.760 --> 52:47.960
MGL against SoCal and then Sacramento show up who are these new kids on the

52:47.960 --> 52:54.960
Okay, you know what, we're an international show and here we are talking about California drama, but I'm sure your neck of the woods has it too.

52:54.960 --> 53:03.960
We've had guests in here that talk about, what Seagrid was here talking about, the two Kansas factions, now it's Seattle versus the rest of California.

53:03.960 --> 53:09.960
Hey, you gotta stop holding the bar. No, no, I remember, you know, back when I played.

53:09.960 --> 53:11.960
There's a battle in your neck of the woods somewhere.

53:11.960 --> 53:16.960
Yeah, I do the whole California thing because, you know, it was just in this end of the woods when I was playing.

53:16.960 --> 53:21.360
playing. But I remember when I started seeing other crews come up, like I remember seeing

53:21.360 --> 53:27.280
one out of Ohio, one out of Iowa. I was like, what the hell? They got DDR up there now?

53:27.280 --> 53:29.800
I thought they were all backwards in that country.

53:29.800 --> 53:33.400
Well, especially when these places started getting DDR first. That was kind of...

53:33.400 --> 53:36.600
Oh yeah, that was really weird, because, you know, I played at a test market. It's like,

53:36.600 --> 53:40.440
you know, California is where it's at, and we're supposed to get everything first other

53:40.440 --> 53:44.440
than Japan, and other people were getting it.

53:44.440 --> 53:50.120
from the chatroom in response to your bar raping comment. Misty in the chatroom says,

53:50.120 --> 53:52.800
I'd rather bar rape and pass the song. Okay, thanks.

53:52.800 --> 53:58.280
Can I have a martini while you're on the bar? No, no. Honestly.

53:58.280 --> 54:02.200
That was a dumb joke. That was a really, really dumb joke. Congratulations.

54:02.200 --> 54:04.680
Because you're bartending. Yeah, I know, I know. I get it.

54:04.680 --> 54:10.120
I honestly grab the bar on occasion when I do my Paranoia 180 freestyle. I do this little

54:10.120 --> 54:14.320
criss-cross step thing, and I can't stop myself from grabbing that bar to do it, otherwise

54:14.320 --> 54:17.280
I'll fall down. But, uh...

54:17.280 --> 54:21.880
This is the, to me, this is the quintessential DER discussion, is bar raping. It seems like

54:21.880 --> 54:26.380
we've had this discussion on the show a thousand times. But it's been a good month. It's been

54:26.380 --> 54:32.040
a few good months since we've had this discussion, so I'm fine with having it again. I'm okay

54:32.040 --> 54:35.520
if other people want to use the bar, because I always say, if they don't want you to use

54:35.520 --> 54:39.560
the bar, they would not have the bar. And people do take the bar off the machine for

54:39.560 --> 54:41.560
I love when we do tournaments with no bar.

55:09.560 --> 55:15.760
That's, that's the, it's another Seattleer thing I saw. Windex on the shoes about the pads.

55:15.760 --> 55:17.640
I don't get the Windex.

55:17.640 --> 55:18.800
Wow.

55:18.800 --> 55:21.720
You're just gonna make all sorts of friends here tonight, aren't ya?

55:21.720 --> 55:25.320
I'm not here to make friends, I'm here to be honest.

55:25.320 --> 55:27.920
But you know, I never got the Windex and stuff, and...

55:27.920 --> 55:31.800
I don't know, I guess it works for Seattleers, because they seem to get really far in PA.

55:31.800 --> 55:37.240
That's right, they kick your ass in PA, really, so maybe you oughta get a, maybe you oughta go to the store and buy a bottle of Windex.

55:37.240 --> 55:41.240
See, that's when I slip and fall on my ass, that's when the pads are too damn slick, but...

55:41.240 --> 55:45.240
Yeah, and, see, this is the reason why I'm not allowed to judge PA.

55:45.240 --> 55:47.240
I mean, it has nothing to do with the fact that it's all point-based.

55:47.240 --> 55:48.240
There is no, yeah, I'm like, there is no...

55:48.240 --> 55:50.240
There's nothing to do with that, you know?

55:50.240 --> 55:53.240
I can't judge, they won't let me judge PA, I've asked and asked and asked,

55:53.240 --> 55:56.240
because I will ream people for stupid-ass shit.

55:56.240 --> 56:01.240
Even though they get perfect all the way through a full combo, I'll be like...

56:01.240 --> 56:06.240
You're grabbing the bar through half the song, please step off.

56:06.240 --> 56:13.240
used to know, rape the bar.

56:36.240 --> 56:42.200
I could stand to play about 48 hours straight worth of DDR to work off all the crap I ate

56:42.200 --> 56:46.080
over the holiday weekend, but it's just not going to happen because I'm lazy.

56:46.080 --> 56:49.840
Man, I'm ready to get back into my own routine. I was at Scandia today staring at the machine

56:49.840 --> 56:55.880
like, hey, I could play that again. You know, I used to play, you know, every night I was

56:55.880 --> 57:00.800
at MGL because I never paid for tokens. I drove by Roseville Golf Land twice over this

57:00.800 --> 57:07.280
past few days here over Christmas, and both times I actually contemplated stopping in,

57:07.280 --> 57:13.400
which is more than I could say for six months ago. Usually I drive right by it and extend

57:13.400 --> 57:17.140
my middle finger and have at it, because that's how I kind of felt about it, because everything

57:17.140 --> 57:21.880
was always broken, there was no point in me stopping. But I've actually contemplated stopping

57:21.880 --> 57:22.880
the last two times. Things are changing.

57:22.880 --> 57:27.560
I hear it's gotten a lot better now. Scania's a lot different now, too.

57:27.560 --> 57:29.960
You think DDR is dead?

57:29.960 --> 57:32.880
I don't think DDR is dead.

57:32.880 --> 57:35.000
People are saying DDR is dead.

57:35.000 --> 57:38.240
I was just responding to a post in the LiveJournal community today where

57:38.240 --> 57:40.400
somebody had said that DDR is dead, and I'm like,

57:40.400 --> 57:43.540
I don't know, buddy. You know, people said 2DX was dead, and

57:43.540 --> 57:46.440
they've just come out with a bunch of more releases in Japan. It looked like it was

57:46.440 --> 57:47.580
going to go under.

57:47.580 --> 57:49.380
Very true. Very true.

57:49.380 --> 57:52.160
Loki says there's a new arcade release coming out, and we'll talk about that

57:52.160 --> 57:54.380
during the next break. What a good segue.

57:54.380 --> 57:56.620
Okay, we're going to go to a break. We're going to come back.

57:56.620 --> 58:01.300
We're going to have our cage match with our special guest entry courtesy of our winner

58:01.300 --> 58:08.700
from the random pick, BRP Ohio Bamani is going to have the chatroom, Big Red Pimp, that's

58:08.700 --> 58:15.420
right, that's what he goes by, Big Red Pimp, sounds like a red mage if I'm not fancy, he's

58:15.420 --> 58:17.460
going to have our chatroom choice tonight.

58:17.460 --> 58:20.340
Loki by the way, if you're wondering why you haven't heard from Loki all this break, he's

58:20.340 --> 58:21.580
cooking right now.

58:21.580 --> 58:23.860
What exactly are you cooking over there, Loki?

58:23.860 --> 58:25.300
Fried rice!

58:25.300 --> 58:26.300
He's making his fried rice.

58:26.300 --> 58:29.300
So we'll be able to have some of that here on the show.

58:29.300 --> 58:34.300
Alright, we'll be back after this break. We're going to get some music from 2DX Red.

58:34.300 --> 58:37.300
Another big game in 2004, a little later this year.

58:37.300 --> 58:41.300
And we'll be back after this. We're going to start it off with a little bit of AA.

58:41.300 --> 58:45.300
Something I know you guys go for in DDR sometimes.

58:45.300 --> 58:48.300
Ha ha ha.

58:48.300 --> 58:50.300
We'll be back.

01:04:50.300 --> 01:05:09.920
Gaming Radio, so uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us at Orange Lounge

01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:14.420
Radio.

01:05:14.420 --> 01:05:22.700
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 124 in progress right now, and I have

01:05:22.700 --> 01:05:28.300
no idea what that means, what the significance of 124 is, but next week will be 125, that's

01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:35.060
kind of a, that's like, you know, a dollar and a quarter, that's pretty big, alright.

01:05:35.060 --> 01:05:39.900
So anyway, we're here, we've got myself, Loki, if you're just joining us, Dark Sakura's out

01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:44.280
tonight, she's a little sick, apparently she's been sleeping a lot, had a resurgence of some

01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:48.600
virus. That's got to suck to get sick on Christmas though, but I've been there. It sucks. It's

01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:53.200
no fun. And Dark Child is here tonight filling in, which is good. We haven't heard from Dark

01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:58.400
Child in a while. And he's old school. We were talking a little bit in that last segment

01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:02.660
there just about some old school. We're living some old school memories. So looking forward

01:06:02.660 --> 01:06:06.760
to the future, because this is the last show of the year. What do you think Bomani has

01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:11.840
in store for 2005? Do you think we're all going to move on, get a life, go to a new

01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:15.020
What do you think the Bomani scene has in store in 2005?

01:06:15.020 --> 01:06:20.680
I see some more DDR coming out, I'd like to see some more come out from Japan with some

01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:27.340
Japanese songs on it instead of this US marketed bullcrap with Britney Spears to dance to.

01:06:27.340 --> 01:06:31.060
Now wait a minute, Britney Spears has not been in a DDR mix yet.

01:06:31.060 --> 01:06:32.060
Not yet.

01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:34.300
She has her own series of music games, remember?

01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:35.300
Yes, yes.

01:06:35.300 --> 01:06:40.420
But you know, I'm betting though with more DDR coming out in the US, there'll be a lot

01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:47.420
There's a lot more US artists in there. Stuff that would attract a larger audience than just the Bahmani people.

01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:53.420
Someone comes out to the arcade, hears a song they know on the radio and they see it's not a game, they're probably more likely to dance on it.

01:06:53.420 --> 01:06:59.420
I'm hoping 2DX keeps going because that's the game I play now instead of DDR.

01:06:59.420 --> 01:07:09.420
If that game is tight, I've seen some songs from 2DX Red where apparently they're some of the hardest songs ever released before and I've seen videos of two guys on doubles not passing it.

01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:13.700
There's some pretty crazy shit in 2DX Red.

01:07:13.700 --> 01:07:15.260
That's all I know so far.

01:07:15.260 --> 01:07:18.820
Yeah, Garrett was kind enough to show me videos.

01:07:18.820 --> 01:07:19.820
It's insane.

01:07:19.820 --> 01:07:24.820
You know, that's all I really see for the Bemani scene is just more DDR, more 2DX coming

01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:25.820
to the US.

01:07:25.820 --> 01:07:28.820
Hopefully they bring out some other crazy ass games.

01:07:28.820 --> 01:07:32.460
I wouldn't mind playing that one butt poking game.

01:07:32.460 --> 01:07:33.460
Boonga Boonga?

01:07:33.460 --> 01:07:34.460
Yeah, Boonga Boonga.

01:07:34.460 --> 01:07:35.460
Alright.

01:07:35.460 --> 01:07:40.380
Let's see, I'm going to put my Miss Cleo hat on here and try to make some Bomani predictions

01:07:40.380 --> 01:07:42.380
for 2005.

01:07:42.380 --> 01:07:49.180
Yes, looking deep into my crystal ball, Bomani predictions 2005.

01:07:49.180 --> 01:07:54.580
Let's see, I predict that there will be an UltraMix 3.

01:07:54.580 --> 01:07:56.060
There's definitely going to be an UltraMix 3.

01:07:56.060 --> 01:08:01.140
I predict there will be an UltraMix 3, because UltraMix 2 is so beloved by the community

01:08:01.140 --> 01:08:03.460
that there will be an UltraMix 3.

01:08:03.460 --> 01:08:06.220
And I predict that a different drum will be involved again.

01:08:07.860 --> 01:08:09.380
Let's see, what else do I predict?

01:08:09.380 --> 01:08:14.580
I predict that there will be an extreme two in the US.

01:08:14.580 --> 01:08:17.820
But it won't be called extreme two.

01:08:17.820 --> 01:08:21.620
I think they're gonna release, I would say,

01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:25.340
remember I have no inside knowledge here, I'm going completely off my Miss Cleo hat

01:08:25.340 --> 01:08:31.740
here, I would say that there's going to be an extreme two,

01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:34.220
but they'll call it party collection just to mess with us.

01:08:34.220 --> 01:08:37.420
But it won't be a rehash of greatest hits.

01:08:37.420 --> 01:08:38.980
It'll be something completely new.

01:08:38.980 --> 01:08:41.060
And it will have Sakura in it

01:08:41.060 --> 01:08:42.940
because everybody bitched when Sakura

01:08:42.940 --> 01:08:45.020
wasn't in DDR Extreme USA.

01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:50.020
So there will be Sakura in DDR Extreme 2

01:08:50.700 --> 01:08:53.660
or Party Collection USA, whatever you wanna call it.

01:08:53.660 --> 01:08:56.520
I think about mid year,

01:08:57.380 --> 01:09:00.820
we're gonna see a new DDR arcade machine in Japan.

01:09:00.820 --> 01:09:08.180
but it's going to be different. That's all. And I think 2DX will continue. There'll still

01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:13.860
be more Guitar Freak and Drummania mixes that we won't know what to do with them. Same thing

01:09:13.860 --> 01:09:20.480
with Papa Music. And I predict that there will be another type of rhythm and music game

01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:24.380
by the end of the year. Like you know how they did Mambo Go Go once? I think they're

01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:31.380
p0k3smot42o I predict that there will still be drama, somebody's bitching will ruin a tournament somewhere

01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:59.560
We'll see. Any other predictions you want to make, Loki? Oh, he's over there cooking.

01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:04.900
He doesn't care. He doesn't care about what's going on over here. All right. We were talking

01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:08.000
a little bit in the last segment before we went to break there. Loki had actually brought

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:13.080
up that there is a new DDR machine coming out, because there is a new DDR machine coming

01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:19.480
out in the UK, and we actually posted a little news item over to our website, orangeloungeradio.com,

01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:24.960
And it does appear that Dancing Stage Fusion Arcade is still happening, and there is some

01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:28.420
more information on the official Konami site, which you can go to just by clicking on the

01:10:28.420 --> 01:10:29.420
link there.

01:10:29.420 --> 01:10:32.940
And it says, and I quote, this is all we have to go off of so far, there's a little picture

01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:38.820
of the machine and it says, spinning its way into Europe is the latest Dancing Stage sensation.

01:10:38.820 --> 01:10:45.100
Step back onto the stage, take the limelight and strut your Christmas stuff to, excuse

01:10:45.100 --> 01:10:51.620
excuse me, to Fusion. Jerry Halliwell, Atomic Kitten, Kim Wilde, and a whole host of other

01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:56.540
well-known artists will be starring in Fusion, making it the biggest and best selection of

01:10:56.540 --> 01:11:02.680
tracks to date. And that's all they have to say about it. So there is a new machine coming,

01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:09.020
and all these artists we hear there have been in DDR before, Jerry Halliwell, It's Rainin'

01:11:09.020 --> 01:11:15.260
men atomic kitten right now fifth mix and Kim Wilde was a home release kids in

01:11:15.260 --> 01:11:21.340
America right in DDR extreme USA and party collect or not part festival

01:11:21.340 --> 01:11:27.620
fusion oh it wasn't a festival my bad my bad I thought it was I can't keep them

01:11:27.620 --> 01:11:32.580
all so there's so many DDR mixes I can't keep them all straight anymore all right

01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:38.300
so we know that's coming we don't have a release date we don't know if it is a

01:11:38.300 --> 01:11:42.860
hardware upgrade what it's going to look like Loki says it is a hardware upgrade

01:11:42.860 --> 01:11:45.740
but we don't know what it's going to look like which is my point if you let

01:11:45.740 --> 01:11:50.660
me finish my thought so we don't know

01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:58.340
Loki's Loki's cooking so we don't have a microphone right now but he's yelling

01:11:58.340 --> 01:12:02.220
about some show where they're going to show this on the 25th through 27th of

01:12:02.220 --> 01:12:07.660
December January of January so we should have some more information come the end

01:12:07.660 --> 01:12:12.300
of January so that's kind of exciting a little bit a little bit because if

01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:16.780
something new comes out in Europe you know maybe maybe here maybe we'll see I

01:12:16.780 --> 01:12:23.900

01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:33.620

there yet we did allow tonight it for those you guys are just joining us

01:12:37.380 --> 01:12:41.500
since Dark Sacros out tonight we allowed something tonight which a lot of you guys been bitching

01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:48.420
for for a long, long time and that is for the chat room to be able to enter a pic. So

01:12:48.420 --> 01:12:53.460
we had, we randomly selected from all the entries we got one person from the chat room

01:12:53.460 --> 01:13:00.020
and we're going to put their song in tonight. And let's see which track of yours won last

01:13:00.020 --> 01:13:07.640
week? Is that Speed Demon? I'm sorry. House of Joy. Why don't I have House of Joy queued

01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:15.300
up here? Alright, I've got to find it. Dark Child, help me fill time here while I figure

01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:23.500
out where my music is. I'm so depressed people. You know, I'm single now. That was a shocker

01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:29.740
to me and I'm trying everything I can to win her back because that woman was like a part

01:13:29.740 --> 01:13:35.900
of me. She was my soulmate, at least in my eyes. And I miss her so much. If anyone knows

01:13:35.900 --> 01:13:40.460
any way they could help or advice they could give me to possibly try and win her back,

01:13:40.460 --> 01:13:50.460
please let me know. I could give you my email address. It's dchild, spelled D-C-H-Y-L-D-E-9-9-9

01:13:50.460 --> 01:13:57.700
at yahoo.com. Stalkers, have fun. As long as it doesn't have a forward listed in the

01:13:57.700 --> 01:14:01.700
in the beginning of the title, I'll probably read it, but I am also a-

01:14:01.700 --> 01:14:04.700
Or if it says Tub Girl, you probably will not read it then.

01:14:04.700 --> 01:14:08.700
No, no, no, I've seen Tub Girl too many times. I don't mind. I'm a freak.

01:14:08.700 --> 01:14:15.700
And I am an IT guy, so don't try to send me viruses, otherwise I will bring hell on your computer.

01:14:15.700 --> 01:14:19.700
Alright, let's get into tonight's cage match. Here we go.

01:14:19.700 --> 01:14:26.700
Last week in the Orange Lawn's Radio Cage Match, Loki won it with an old Orange Lawn's Radio favorite,

01:14:26.700 --> 01:14:31.540
a.k.a. Midihead in the track is House of Joy. Remember the cage match works this

01:14:31.540 --> 01:14:36.540
way. Three songs are put into the cage match and you guys vote for your

01:14:36.540 --> 01:14:40.980
favorite and the winning song goes in a rotation all week long on Orange Lounge

01:14:40.980 --> 01:14:46.260
Radio Live. Alright so here we go you guys get to pick remember you get your

01:14:46.260 --> 01:14:50.860
vote and you get a clip of last week's winner because you were listening last

01:14:50.860 --> 01:14:54.580
week right so you already heard this song so you only get a clip. So here it is

01:14:54.580 --> 01:14:58.240
Song number one that you can vote for tonight a clip of monolithic house of joy

01:15:24.580 --> 01:15:27.580
And the night will also shine

01:15:27.580 --> 01:15:31.580
The beat of the world pounds upon your back

01:15:31.580 --> 01:15:33.580
And it's beating on my back

01:15:33.580 --> 01:15:38.580
Like your life spreads you to the right

01:15:38.580 --> 01:15:42.580
Left here to die

01:15:42.580 --> 01:15:46.580
If I live

01:15:46.580 --> 01:15:51.580
You'll raise me

01:15:51.580 --> 01:15:59.580
You hold the key to the house door

01:15:59.580 --> 01:16:06.580
Enter and leave all your sorrow

01:16:06.580 --> 01:16:12.580
Here is the key to the house door

01:16:12.580 --> 01:16:17.580
Come in and build your tomorrow

01:16:17.580 --> 01:16:26.580
Is waiting for you

01:16:47.580 --> 01:16:50.580
You don't have the love to muddy

01:17:17.580 --> 01:17:24.920
to balance the gothy beats of monolithic. So my pick is a band called Jevene and

01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:29.940
the song is called Don't Walk Away. So here it is and I hope you won't walk

01:17:29.940 --> 01:17:33.600
away from it. It's song number two, Jevene, Don't Walk Away, here in the Orange

01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:40.600
on her new page match.

01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:07.600
Will you hear that from me when I need to go to home?

01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:11.600
Baby, don't misunderstand, I still want you for my man

01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:15.600
I just need you, before I miss my love

01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:18.600
Don't walk away

01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:22.600
Don't walk away

01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:26.600
Don't walk away

01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:29.600
Don't walk away

01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:31.600
Don't walk away

01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:35.600
One way, I know one way

01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:39.600
No no, don't walk away

01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:44.600
I'll be right back for you

01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:49.600
I'll be right back for you

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:56.600
I'll be right back for you

01:18:56.600 --> 01:19:00.600
There are other things that I like to hear

01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:03.800
You bet you're my first baby, love to have exhausted me

01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:05.800
Won't you feel your love?

01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:07.300
So I'll be for sure

01:19:07.300 --> 01:19:09.300
Don't let it need me, baby

01:19:09.300 --> 01:19:11.300
It's just every night

01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:14.300
It's only time to smile over your eyes

01:19:14.300 --> 01:19:16.300
Will you be there for me?

01:19:16.300 --> 01:19:18.300
And I need someone to hold

01:19:18.300 --> 01:19:19.800
Baby, don't misunderstand me

01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:21.800
I still want you for my man

01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:23.300
I just need you like that

01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:26.300
Because I am with my love

01:19:26.300 --> 01:19:28.300
Don't know how I'll be

01:19:28.300 --> 01:19:30.300
Don't know how I'll be

01:19:30.300 --> 01:19:33.080
Won't hurt you, no

01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:34.860
Go all the way

01:19:34.860 --> 01:19:39.020
Go all the way

01:19:39.020 --> 01:19:40.960
You never told me for a change

01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:42.700
I want you for me

01:19:42.700 --> 01:19:44.260
I need a little time

01:19:44.260 --> 01:19:46.960
Before I ever give my life

01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:49.500
Don't walk away

01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:50.980
I'll be right there for you

01:19:50.980 --> 01:19:53.720
Be right there for you

01:19:53.720 --> 01:20:22.920
I've got all this love waiting just for you I just gotta know that your love is true

01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:26.420
Can't get what it was in the end of my life

01:20:26.420 --> 01:20:29.920
Wanna be your girl, not towards the good side

01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:32.920
In time to get back to my love

01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:34.920
Your high will be enough for me

01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:36.920
And when I need someone to hold me

01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:38.920
Baby, don't misunderstand

01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:40.420
I still want you for my man

01:20:40.420 --> 01:20:41.920
I just need you for me

01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:44.920
Before I invent my love

01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:50.420
Don't walk away

01:21:20.420 --> 01:21:27.420
don't walk away

01:21:43.300 --> 01:21:48.820
alright that was song number two, Jeeveen don't walk away and let's see if the folks

01:21:48.820 --> 01:21:53.620
in our studio wanted to walk away or walk real close to that song.

01:21:53.620 --> 01:21:56.620
Doug Child, what did you think of Don't Walk Away?

01:21:56.620 --> 01:21:59.300
I thought it was a nice trancy song, you know.

01:21:59.300 --> 01:22:02.620
Kind of uplifting for the mood I'm in.

01:22:02.620 --> 01:22:04.020
I liked it.

01:22:04.020 --> 01:22:08.380
Wow, you're usually full of hatred for our Cagemats picks. Yeah, but you know, I'm full of

01:22:08.380 --> 01:22:12.660
hatred when I walked in the door today, and you know, you fasted away a song that kind of uplifted me a bit.

01:22:12.660 --> 01:22:15.080
Oh, okay.

01:22:15.080 --> 01:22:16.220
Don't Walk Away.

01:22:16.220 --> 01:22:18.620
Jeeveen, Don't Walk Away.

01:22:18.620 --> 01:22:20.860
Or maybe JAVINE, I don't know.

01:22:20.860 --> 01:22:25.620
J-A-V-I-N-E. I want to say JAVINE, so that's what I'm going to say.

01:22:25.620 --> 01:22:26.620
How about HAVINEA?

01:22:26.620 --> 01:22:27.800
HAVINEA. Alright, give it a score.

01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:31.020
Uh, I'll give it about a 7 right now.

01:22:31.020 --> 01:22:37.420
You know, when I first heard that song, I would have given it like an 8, but I really like that song a lot more, the more I listen to it.

01:22:37.420 --> 01:22:40.620
Uh, it's very DDR-ish. It reminds me of Test, actually, a lot.

01:22:40.620 --> 01:22:44.740
So I give it a 9. Actually, no, I want to give it a 9, too.

01:22:44.740 --> 01:22:47.020
You know what? Anita, just listen to the song, please.

01:22:47.020 --> 01:22:52.020
Oh my, okay. Uh, Loki, what would you give that song? He's holding up eight.

01:22:52.020 --> 01:22:55.020
All right, he's too busy cooking to give a shit about anything else right now.

01:22:55.020 --> 01:23:00.520
All right, let's get into song number three. Remember, it doesn't matter what we think, it comes down to your guys' votes, so let's find out.

01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:09.020
All right, here we go. Chatroom Choice, Big Red Pimp, Ohio Bamani putting this one in on behalf of our chatroom.

01:23:09.020 --> 01:23:14.520
Here it is. And this is, you know what, this is okay because this is the kind of song I could kind of see Jamie putting in.

01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:16.520
She likes the J-pop and stuff, so this is good.

01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:23.520
It's Lark and Seal, and the song is called Ready Steady Go, not to be confused with Apollo Control 1, okay?

01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:31.520
So here it is, the Chatroom Choice, song number 3, Lark and Seal, Ready Steady Go. Enjoy!

01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:49.520
Riddick said he can't take no back Riddick said he can't take no back

01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:53.520
Like a satellite, it's having a lot of fun

01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:09.520
Kukitamtay kukukay

01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:12.520
Kala kadoyang istayay

01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:15.520
Kukitamtay keletemu

01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:44.160
the

01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:16.160

Ready so that you make them back

01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:20.160
Ready so that you make them back

01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:22.160
Ready so that you make them back

01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:26.160
Let the fellow race let it go

01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:30.160
Alrighty, that was song number three in tonight's cage match.

01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:34.160
Lark and Seal, Ready Steady Go.

01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:38.160
What do you think? Ready Steady Go or Ready Steady Go Away? What do you think?

01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:42.160
It sounds like a pop music song. It sounds like a bunch of pop music songs.

01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:46.160
Yeah, I kind of got the guitar freak vibe from it.

01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:50.160
Yeah, guitar freak, pop music, same thing.

01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:54.160
I kind of liked it. I saw some people in the chatroom said it sounded kind of like Full Metal Alchemist.

01:27:54.160 --> 01:27:58.660
alchemist which I kind of would have I believe that's where the song came from

01:27:58.660 --> 01:28:04.240
was a FMA fansite what they were saying yeah so you know I kind of liked it for

01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:10.840
like a little J poppy song I'll give it about a seven no no I'll give it a nine

01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:17.980
Anita don't listen to the name of that song all right I I liked it actually it

01:28:17.980 --> 01:28:20.160
was very good I was a little wary about letting the

01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:23.040
chow room pick something but I think they did a good job on that one I guess

01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:28.320
Angel helped on that I'm supposed to say but anyway, um, I thought it was good. I'd give it about me in a half

01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:32.360
It was good. It was very I could see that number body game. Very poppy. I liked it Loki

01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:42.800
It just wouldn't be a cage match if Loki didn't hate on something any particular reason why

01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:48.600
Alright

01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:54.320

01:30:17.380 --> 01:30:19.420
That's kind of unfair, but we'll see.

01:30:19.420 --> 01:30:23.860
Or will Javeen kind of sneak in there, end up getting through a split vote, and walk

01:30:23.860 --> 01:30:24.860
away with it?

01:30:24.860 --> 01:30:27.140
We'll see when we come back for our next break.

01:30:27.140 --> 01:30:31.460
But in the meantime, while you guys are voting, you look like you have a thought, Darkchild.

01:30:31.460 --> 01:30:34.940
In the famous words of P. Diddy, vote or die.

01:30:34.940 --> 01:30:39.700
That's right, vote or die, because you've seen what's happened on this show and nobody

01:30:39.700 --> 01:30:40.700
votes.

01:30:40.700 --> 01:30:42.620
If one person votes, that's enough for us, boys and girls.

01:30:42.620 --> 01:30:46.920
let one vote decide the whole damn thing and I already see at least three locked

01:30:46.920 --> 01:30:54.160
in there so plenty of votes already so we'll we'll see all right um let's see I

01:30:54.160 --> 01:30:57.320
wanted to open up the skype line to hopefully talk to some of our callers I

01:30:57.320 --> 01:31:00.800
just want to check out you know what kind of loot you guys got for Christmas

01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:05.000
especially when it comes to games and video games and things like that I'm

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:08.540
kind of curious about what kind of loot you guys got if you are naughty or nice

01:31:08.540 --> 01:31:13.480
this year and what Santa brought you instead. So we'll see. I'm gonna open up

01:31:13.480 --> 01:31:16.220
the skype line there. Remember if you want more information on the skype line

01:31:16.220 --> 01:31:21.740
head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on interact with us. For those

01:31:21.740 --> 01:31:24.500
of you guys that are kind of new to Orange Lounge Radio, the skype line allows

01:31:24.500 --> 01:31:27.900
you to talk. All you got to have is a microphone and then you don't have to

01:31:27.900 --> 01:31:31.500
have a phone. All you got to do is call over the internet. Please though, before you call

01:31:31.500 --> 01:31:37.100
the show, make sure all your pornography torrents are turned off because it will

01:31:37.100 --> 01:31:41.580
fudge up your bandwidth and then you we have a hard time hearing you and we have

01:31:41.580 --> 01:31:46.700
to hang up on you we don't like doing that so and I know Loki does enjoy

01:31:46.700 --> 01:31:50.460
hanging up on people but please turn the porn torrents off before you call and

01:31:50.460 --> 01:31:53.740
for the love of God first rule of real radio and it applies to internet radio

01:31:53.740 --> 01:31:57.660
as well turn your speakers down when you call in please because we don't need to

01:31:57.660 --> 01:32:02.820
hear ourselves okay we we hear enough of ourselves doing this show so please do

01:32:02.820 --> 01:32:06.460
not leave your speakers up when you call in so we'll wait and see if anybody

01:32:06.460 --> 01:32:11.260
calls in. I do notice that we only have about half the people listening tonight that we

01:32:11.260 --> 01:32:17.420
usually do, which is kind of a hit for us. I understand why, probably because a lot of

01:32:17.420 --> 01:32:22.380
folks are away doing the holiday thing. They're at mommy's house or grandma's house or something

01:32:22.380 --> 01:32:26.640
and they're doing the holiday stuff or they're playing with their new DS or they're doing

01:32:26.640 --> 01:32:31.480
something. We just don't have the same amount of people that we usually do, so they'll be

01:32:31.480 --> 01:32:35.880
all tuning in Friday on DER Freak to catch what they missed. And that's at 6 o'clock

01:32:35.880 --> 01:32:39.720
Pacific Standard Time, if you want to hear that. Also, though, we do have other spinoff

01:32:39.720 --> 01:32:44.680
programming here on Orange Lounge Radio, including Diversion, the Orange Lounge Radio remake

01:32:44.680 --> 01:32:49.200
show, that's on Monday nights. And Tuesday nights, Pump Up the Volume, featuring Dark

01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:53.400
Sakura, hopefully she'll be back, I know she's a little bit sick, but she should be coming

01:32:53.400 --> 01:32:57.040
back this Tuesday, we'll see, we'll check in with her, hopefully she's doing alright.

01:32:57.040 --> 01:33:03.920
And then Thursday nights, Outside the Box, where myself, Rice Princess, and Lanky Style

01:33:03.920 --> 01:33:09.800
I'll talk about all sorts of other video gaming things. Maybe postpone this week. Likeystyle

01:33:09.800 --> 01:33:13.220
had some work issues come up. He's not been able to come to the show. I should be here

01:33:13.220 --> 01:33:18.480
though. We might just do a Skye experience if nothing else. So we'll see. So that's all

01:33:18.480 --> 01:33:25.120
the programming you'll look forward to. And something else brand new. Something brand

01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:30.100
new we're looking to roll out this week. But we're not going to talk about it just yet

01:33:30.100 --> 01:33:33.420
because we want to make sure all the

01:33:33.420 --> 01:33:36.260
t's are crossed and all the i's are dotted

01:33:36.260 --> 01:33:38.220
it's a new program

01:33:38.220 --> 01:33:40.340
but it's not something you're going to hear

01:33:40.340 --> 01:33:42.580
on live 365

01:33:42.580 --> 01:33:46.620
but i'm going to spill it for you right now it's going to be the low key fried rice

01:33:46.620 --> 01:33:53.620
experience

01:33:54.260 --> 01:33:57.500
yes the low key fried rice experience no seriously though there is something we're

01:33:57.500 --> 01:33:58.740
working on

01:33:58.740 --> 01:33:59.660
uh...

01:33:59.660 --> 01:34:03.100
and it involves radio but is not and we love live three sixty five please don't

01:34:03.100 --> 01:34:04.700
get us wrong they're great folks

01:34:04.700 --> 01:34:06.200
we love having it on there

01:34:06.200 --> 01:34:09.960
uh... but we're going to do something a little different

01:34:09.960 --> 01:34:13.080
this will answer one of the i would say the number

01:34:13.080 --> 01:34:17.120
one requests we get out there from the listeners number one thing people

01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:20.400
request of the show we're gonna get taken care of it can we have other other

01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:22.080
than the hand jobs what

01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:24.600
do they request that they have more dark child

01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:28.720
uh... that's not number nine on the list

01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:33.600
So we'll see, we're hoping, watch our website, www.orangeonsray.com, watch the website, we

01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:36.600
should have more information on that sometime this week.

01:34:36.600 --> 01:34:41.160
All right, nobody's calling in the Skype line, you guys are all shy, I see how it is, it's

01:34:41.160 --> 01:34:42.160
fine, it's fine.

01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:45.160
Well, we only have about half the people we usually do, I think a lot of our regular callers

01:34:45.160 --> 01:34:47.480
are out tonight, so fine, whatever.

01:34:47.480 --> 01:34:52.680
One other thing I wanted to talk about, I want to talk about some of the things coming

01:34:52.680 --> 01:34:53.680
up with the new year.

01:34:53.680 --> 01:34:56.240
We've been talking about our predictions for what Bamani's going to look like in the new

01:34:56.240 --> 01:34:57.240
year.

01:34:57.240 --> 01:35:01.980
those New Year's resolutions you don't intend on keeping? What are some of those New Year's

01:35:01.980 --> 01:35:05.760
resolutions you guys are going to be setting that you do not intend on keeping? Or maybe

01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:13.240
you do intend on keeping it, I don't know. Low key. Celibacy. Come on, that's not even

01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:17.560
something you would ever even suggest. I'm talking about things that you might actually

01:35:17.560 --> 01:35:22.960
consider doing. You're not going to be celibate. I think your girlfriend would have a problem

01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:27.240
with that or maybe not I don't know if she was you're pretty quick to say that

01:35:27.240 --> 01:35:30.760
no do you have any serious like things you want to commit yourself to doing

01:35:30.760 --> 01:35:35.520
like I don't know maybe sit-ups

01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:42.680
finishing the cabinet finishing your pet project or the arcade cabinet that's

01:35:42.680 --> 01:35:45.120
something I know you always say you're gonna do I'm gonna work on the cabinet

01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:48.680
I'm gonna work for I'm gonna I'm gonna work on the cabinet oh I got a party

01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:53.960
inviting Final Fantasy XI. Darkchild, New Year's Resolutions you don't intend on keeping?

01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:58.000
Oh, I intend on keeping all of them. Alright, well anything you want to share with our,

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:03.680
that would be appropriate to share with our listeners? Yeah, basically, uh, to grow up

01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:09.800
finally. You know, I've been acting a lot younger than I should be, and it's time I

01:36:09.800 --> 01:36:13.720
grew up. Alright, we're gonna go to the phones because we got a call, so let's go to the

01:36:13.720 --> 01:36:20.720
the phone. Yay! Hello, you're on Orange Zon's radio. Hello. Hi, who dis? Big Red Pimp. Hello,

01:36:20.920 --> 01:36:26.920
Big Red Pimp, how are you? I'm pretty good. Alright, I have to ask, why Big Red Pimp?

01:36:26.920 --> 01:36:33.040
Tall, red-headed, and dressed like a demon. Okay, okay, I got it. Now, you were the guy

01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:37.960
that picked Lark and Seal Ready City Go for tonight's cage match, right? Yep. Alright,

01:36:37.960 --> 01:36:42.840
why did you choose that song? I'm just hooked on Full Metal Alchemist right now. Okay, so

01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:49.840
kostjamrh By the way, Loki, I'd vote for your song just

01:36:50.340 --> 01:36:51.840
to be civil about it.

01:36:51.840 --> 01:36:54.040
kostjamrh Oh, so you voted for Loki's song, just to

01:36:54.040 --> 01:36:55.040
be civil?

01:36:55.040 --> 01:36:56.040
kostjamrh Yep.

01:36:56.040 --> 01:37:00.800
kostjamrh Oh, so even though you went and hated on that

01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:04.600
song, Loki, he went and voted for your song. Wasn't that nice of him?

01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:06.800
kostjamrh He just realized what the better song was.

01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:09.800
kostjamrh Oh snap, what do you have to say about that?

01:37:09.800 --> 01:37:16.800
I'd have a dirt quad for you.

01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:18.800
How was your Christmas? How was your holiday?

01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:21.800
It was pretty good other than getting a migraine for my niece.

01:37:21.800 --> 01:37:23.800
Oh, I'm sorry. How old's your niece?

01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:24.800
Four years old.

01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:29.800
I see. Most four-year-olds do cause migraines. Happens at the arcade all the time.

01:37:29.800 --> 01:37:32.800
Did you get what you wanted for Christmas?

01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:34.800
Not quite, except for the money.

01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:37.800
Well, money's good. What did you ask for for Christmas?

01:37:37.800 --> 01:37:38.800
Nothing.

01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:40.800
You didn't ask for anything?

01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:43.800
Didn't ask for anything because nobody could afford anything.

01:37:43.800 --> 01:37:47.800
Well then you can't be disappointed with what you got if you didn't have anything on your list, right?

01:37:47.800 --> 01:37:48.800
Exactly.

01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:52.800
I'd be disappointed if I asked for nothing and someone gave me something.

01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:59.800
He says he'd be a little disappointed if he asked for nothing and then he got something.

01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:03.800
At least this year I have heat in the house so I don't have to worry about anything.

01:38:03.800 --> 01:38:10.800
There you go, there you go. Now see, me personally, I don't make lists either, but I'm very grateful

01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:14.040
with whatever I get, because I always like when people buy me things, because hey, free

01:38:14.040 --> 01:38:15.040
stuff.

01:38:15.040 --> 01:38:18.880
And see, the best thing about getting money is that you're not disappointed with whatever

01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:19.880
you buy.

01:38:19.880 --> 01:38:25.320
Exactly. Money is a great Christmas present. There you go. Any New Year's resolutions you

01:38:25.320 --> 01:38:26.320
don't intend on keeping?

01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:30.120
To get off this caffeine high.

01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:34.040
Get off the caffeine high! How much caffeine would you say you drink in a day?

01:38:34.040 --> 01:38:41.600
Uh, actually I stopped last week, but I've been kinda dipping out into a little bit of caffeine, so I'm like, one can a pepsi a day.

01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:48.020
Well, you know that's why you're getting the migraines there, because you're kicking the caffeine habit, and so caffeine is something that helps prevent migraines.

01:38:48.020 --> 01:38:57.160
This happened to me a lot when I kicked the caffeine habit, because I used to be the kind of guy, I would drink, uh, one of those 20 ounce bottles of Mountain Dew, Code Red, every morning to wake up,

01:38:57.160 --> 01:39:01.160
And I kicked it, and I got a lot of headaches when I quit, but I'll tell you what, I lost a lot of weight too.

01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:09.160
Yeah, I kicked my caffeine habit. I was on, like, six Mocha Frap full bars a day, that's five shots of espresso in there, plus all kinds of other espresso drinks.

01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:14.160
I worked at a coffee shop, it was horrible, but when I quit it, you know, I was shaking migraines and everything, but eventually I did.

01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:15.160
Oh my God, ugly, ugly.

01:39:15.160 --> 01:39:19.160
I had the choice to get off the caffeine because I kind of had a panic attack.

01:39:19.160 --> 01:39:24.160
Oh, ouch. Well, I hope, I hope this is the road to getting better for you then.

01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:27.220
for you then I think you're gonna find though that you know when you stop

01:39:27.220 --> 01:39:30.760
drinking all that soda and if you ever decide that you can switch from Pepsi to

01:39:30.760 --> 01:39:35.480
Diet Pepsi that you'll start losing weight because all these calories that's

01:39:35.480 --> 01:39:38.840
how I lost anyway of course I gained it all back over Christmas but that's all

01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:43.800
right yeah I'll lose it again some suggestions in the chat room as well on

01:39:43.800 --> 01:39:48.880
Ram says in our chat room extra water helps with a migraine so drink tons of

01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:55.760
water. Okay. All right. Some friendly advice from us here at Orange Songs Radio. All right.

01:39:55.760 --> 01:40:02.080
I'll get off here now. All right. Feel better. All right. Bye. New caller. We like it when

01:40:02.080 --> 01:40:06.680
new people call in. Yay. And then we don't look so stupid by not getting any calls. That

01:40:06.680 --> 01:40:11.120
makes me feel really good. All right. We're going to go to a break. And in this break,

01:40:11.120 --> 01:40:15.240
we're going to take care of a few requests. We have some songs that were requested. So

01:40:15.240 --> 01:40:18.320
we're going to take care of those. And I'm going to grab myself some fried rice, damn

01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:23.320
it because that stuff is smelling very good and I want some, so I'm going to...

01:40:23.320 --> 01:40:25.320
It's a little heavy on the soy sauce. What'd you say?

01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:29.320
It's a little heavy on the soy sauce, I put a little too much.

01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:33.320
That's alright, cancer sounds fine to me, so, don't they say that causes cancer or something?

01:40:33.320 --> 01:40:38.320
No, I don't know. One way to find out. Alright, we will go to this break. We're going to tally

01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:42.320
up the cage match votes and figure out about that when we come back. We'll get to the FUs

01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:49.320
the FUs of the Week at some point as well. We'll be back after this on Orange Launch Radio.

01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:44.320
you

01:45:42.320 --> 01:45:43.920
Stop before my watch!

01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:48.920
SLAM

01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:49.920
Story time!

01:46:02.520 --> 01:46:06.520
Born to be an angel, you will never surrender

01:46:06.520 --> 01:46:08.520
Surrender

01:46:08.520 --> 01:46:12.520
Love's the only thing that makes me wonder

01:46:12.520 --> 01:46:14.520
It loves me hard

01:46:14.520 --> 01:46:17.520
Just because I feel crazy

01:46:17.520 --> 01:46:21.520
And every scream of love and pain

01:46:21.520 --> 01:46:23.520
I am

01:46:23.520 --> 01:46:25.520
Who made me realize my fire

01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:30.520
Sky kite is a truth, a free mystery

01:46:30.520 --> 01:46:32.520
Like a tender night for you

01:46:32.520 --> 01:46:36.520
Sky kite is the best in this world I'll ever

01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:39.020
He's a hoe in my heart, in my mind

01:46:39.020 --> 01:46:39.520
Yeah!

01:46:41.520 --> 01:46:42.520
Shine high,

01:46:42.520 --> 01:46:45.020
Like a fruit from a dream that's unreal

01:46:47.520 --> 01:46:48.520
Shine high,

01:46:48.520 --> 01:46:51.020
It's the best of the time, oh yeah, well

01:46:54.020 --> 01:46:54.520
Yeah!

01:46:54.520 --> 01:46:56.520
Stay free!

01:47:10.520 --> 01:47:19.520
And now it's time for Erotic Pop Idol, where we will find the next singer for everyone's favorite perverse baumanni band, Erotic!

01:47:19.520 --> 01:47:22.520
Do it all night. Do it with me.

01:47:22.520 --> 01:47:27.800
No, no, that was awful! Bloody terrible! Do you take vocal lessons? Kill your teacher!

01:47:27.800 --> 01:47:29.400
In the heat of the night.

01:47:29.400 --> 01:47:32.040
Oh god, I think my ears are bleeding!

01:47:32.040 --> 01:47:34.040
I liked it!

01:47:34.040 --> 01:47:36.600
Shut the bloody hell up, Paula! Next!

01:47:36.600 --> 01:47:41.880
Oh, that was cool.

01:47:41.880 --> 01:47:46.360
Do you even know why you're here? That was just bloody pathetic! Next!

01:47:46.360 --> 01:47:51.400
Come on, do it with me.

01:47:51.400 --> 01:47:54.600
Yes! Yes, that's it! We have a winner!

01:48:21.400 --> 01:48:27.000
show up in January? I don't know. I don't watch it anymore. As I became retarded. Wait

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:30.160
a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. You and the girlfriend used to watch it every

01:48:30.160 --> 01:48:34.720
single week religiously. What the hell's going on? Yeah, that was like two years ago. We

01:48:34.720 --> 01:48:40.360
also used to watch The Apprentice. Didn't do that anymore. We also used to watch Survivor.

01:48:40.360 --> 01:48:47.280
Stopped doing that. Why? Because the shows just got tired. They need to be retired. No,

01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:53.640
know you just want to have sex more shows tired and you started watching

01:48:53.640 --> 01:49:02.760
queer I know you've already seen all this now they're all reruns all right if

01:49:02.760 --> 01:49:05.640
I sound like I'm eating right now it's because I am you should get some of this

01:49:05.640 --> 01:49:10.120
dark night it's very good but some of the Loki's fried rice can cut I say

01:49:10.120 --> 01:49:17.200
dark night dark child you you people would dark in your name you're all

01:49:17.200 --> 01:49:26.900
the same dark dragon dark person dark demon dark you know what I say we just

01:49:26.900 --> 01:49:30.880
quit the show we'll take dark night here and go trick-or-treating see you did it

01:49:30.880 --> 01:49:35.920
too that's okay cuz remember I have a new nickname now I'm no longer Dark

01:49:35.920 --> 01:49:43.120
Child I'm now Dark Aphelion he's now Dark Man no longer a child he has become

01:49:43.120 --> 01:49:52.300
become a man. Wait a second, that face sucks. Dark Man 999. I like it. Yeah, let's not confuse

01:49:52.300 --> 01:49:59.980
him with that really horrible movie that actually had sequels. Why? Wait, isn't that Donnie

01:49:59.980 --> 01:50:06.540
Darko? No, Dark, Dark Man. Remember the stupid guy with his face got burnt off or something

01:50:06.540 --> 01:50:10.640
so he makes a new face and it was like the whole Phantom of the Opera thing going but

01:50:10.640 --> 01:50:16.280
really stupid. Wasn't that Mel Gibson, the man without a face? No, no, no, this is Darkman.

01:50:16.280 --> 01:50:22.080
It's just like another line of the series, just like the Tremors movies, just like Species,

01:50:22.080 --> 01:50:26.800
just like, oh, it's another really shitty movie that they've made a lot of, um, The

01:50:26.800 --> 01:50:32.860
Relic. No, Nightmare on Elm Street, actually, everything's theatrical. It's just, um, like

01:50:32.860 --> 01:50:38.600
uh, Hellraiser. There are all these horror movies that just keep having sequels. Children

01:50:38.600 --> 01:50:43.100
of the corn. There are all these horror movies that have tons of sequels that no one ever

01:50:43.100 --> 01:50:49.700
hears about. The Leprechaun. It's just like, Leprechaun back in the hood. Leprechaun 2

01:50:49.700 --> 01:50:55.580
in the hood, back to the hood. Like they thought they needed, you know we just don't have enough

01:50:55.580 --> 01:51:02.420
Leprechaun in the hood, we need more. Who makes these decisions, seriously? Was that

01:51:02.420 --> 01:51:07.620
like well this is the best thing we've got i mean is that that bad over there i swear

01:51:09.700 --> 01:51:15.220
i mean honestly i have seen horror movies that i don't know how the fuck they get distributed

01:51:15.220 --> 01:51:20.900
on tape i mean because i collect these things i have like i say the worst movie i've ever seen

01:51:20.900 --> 01:51:24.980
other than manos in the hands of fate because manos i've watched that on mystery science

01:51:24.980 --> 01:51:29.540
year 3000 i've watched it by itself no matter what that movie is so boring it will put me

01:51:29.540 --> 01:51:34.980
me to sleep every time. You survived watching it with itself, not Mystery Science Theater?

01:51:34.980 --> 01:51:39.140
It was hard. Now wait, here we go, here we go. I got a brilliant idea. We're gonna kill

01:51:39.140 --> 01:51:44.380
two birds with one stone. Since we are Orange Lounge Radio, and we are a Bamani, supposedly

01:51:44.380 --> 01:51:51.140
we're about Bamani in music video games, supposedly, although we know we're really not. We're all

01:51:51.140 --> 01:51:55.420
about that. And we like horror movies, and we've decided we need to make a direct-to-video

01:51:55.420 --> 01:52:01.060
horror movie here it is we're gonna make ddr-freak the horror movie what do you

01:52:01.060 --> 01:52:03.340
think because everybody's been complaining about how they want to see a

01:52:03.340 --> 01:52:06.860
ddr-freak movie there you go we'll just have it be a horror movie

01:52:06.860 --> 01:52:11.140
we'll film it at golf land and like children will die only they're really

01:52:11.140 --> 01:52:17.140
dying that's stupid I think it'd be alright as long as it doesn't have a

01:52:17.140 --> 01:52:23.980
sequel called ddr-spot and then Warwick Davis will be in it give me back me pot

01:52:23.980 --> 01:52:33.420
of gold. Give me back me tokens! Oh my god. No. No. See, the thing with DDR is it doesn't

01:52:33.420 --> 01:52:39.140
translate well at all to cinema. You just, there's no... Okay, you got served. Case in

01:52:39.140 --> 01:52:42.740
point. Oh well, actually, wait a minute, I'm kind of fighting myself. Hey, you forgot about

01:52:42.740 --> 01:52:49.020
Wasabi. The DDR part of that was tight. I remember that. But anyways, the whole point

01:52:49.020 --> 01:52:54.780
of it is that there's no actual story to DDR, so you cannot make a DDR movie.

01:52:54.780 --> 01:53:01.740
What if you had DDR? Now, what about the wizard? You can't make a movie about video games,

01:53:01.740 --> 01:53:06.020
but they made this, you know, going plot. That wasn't Super Mario Bros. movies. Shut

01:53:06.020 --> 01:53:10.980
your damn mouth for a minute. What if they had, it's like the wizard, like that was 15

01:53:10.980 --> 01:53:15.180
years ago, and you know how they remake movies once they're, you know, so old? We could remake

01:53:15.180 --> 01:53:21.660
the wizard, but now the central thing is DDR. And there's a kid, and it could star DDRbot,

01:53:21.660 --> 01:53:24.620
because he's a kid, right? And DDRbot is like this prodigy...

01:53:24.620 --> 01:53:25.620
California!

01:53:25.620 --> 01:53:28.540
Exactly. He's this prodigy at DDR.

01:53:28.540 --> 01:53:30.660
Hey, he took first place at Max Games.

01:53:30.660 --> 01:53:36.580
Hey, hey, hey. Okay, here we go. I'm on a thigh here. Okay. So DDRbot, kid who's really

01:53:36.580 --> 01:53:43.020
good at DDR, and he's going to Universal Studios for the big DDR tournament. What did they

01:53:43.020 --> 01:53:47.700
they call it in the wizard? What was the name of it? Armageddon! DDR Armageddon! Right?

01:53:47.700 --> 01:53:54.980
So that'll be the tournament that's at Universal Studios. And then when we get there, DDR Extreme

01:53:54.980 --> 01:54:01.100
2! A game that nobody's ever seen! And then like, you could be in it, and you've got like

01:54:01.100 --> 01:54:08.220
this device that you have on your feet, the power boots, and it's like, no that's so stupid.

01:54:08.220 --> 01:54:12.220
The power boots. They're so bad.

01:54:12.220 --> 01:54:16.220
Your idea. And they have little LED lights in them that light up to the music.

01:54:16.220 --> 01:54:20.220
Yeah, right. No! And then will DDRbot

01:54:20.220 --> 01:54:24.220
like mysteriously just know a secret code for the game even though it just came out?

01:54:24.220 --> 01:54:28.220
That could be Mel B. Because Mel B would have the power boots.

01:54:28.220 --> 01:54:32.220
Think about it guys. Think about it.

01:54:32.220 --> 01:54:36.220
And then like, see, DDRbot and his wacky friends

01:54:36.220 --> 01:54:40.220
Don't be the wacky friends. You, me, and Dark Sakura can be the wacky friends, because you remember...

01:54:40.220 --> 01:54:42.220
Wait, no, no, no! Shut up!

01:54:42.220 --> 01:54:46.220
You remember that in the wizard there was that sassy girl that went with him that,

01:54:46.220 --> 01:54:50.220
Ah! He touched my breast! Remember that? That could be Dark Sakura.

01:54:50.220 --> 01:54:54.220
Ah! He touched my breast! There you go.

01:54:54.220 --> 01:54:58.220
And then, like, you and I can somehow be Fred Savage.

01:54:58.220 --> 01:55:03.220
This is great. I'm gonna, I'm freaking writing a letter to Warner Brothers tomorrow.

01:55:03.220 --> 01:55:07.220
Well, they did make Catwoman, so why not?

01:55:07.220 --> 01:55:10.220
Um, no, honestly, that's a retarded idea.

01:55:10.220 --> 01:55:13.220
How's that a horror movie?

01:55:13.220 --> 01:55:14.220
Oh, okay, okay.

01:55:14.220 --> 01:55:17.220
Okay, and then at the end, everybody gets killed. There you go.

01:55:17.220 --> 01:55:18.220
Oh, okay.

01:55:18.220 --> 01:55:20.220
Except DDRbot, because he's cool.

01:55:20.220 --> 01:55:23.220
But you, me, and Jamie, we die horrible, gruesome deaths.

01:55:23.220 --> 01:55:27.220
DDRbot does, like, the whole children of the corn thing, and he's the reason everybody dies.

01:55:27.220 --> 01:55:30.220
He, like, goes all Carrie Fisher on them.

01:55:30.220 --> 01:55:35.220
kostjamrh There are so many bad movies out there, and they just keep on making them.

01:56:00.220 --> 01:56:03.220
Shut up.

01:56:03.220 --> 01:56:07.220
How about we just have the Power Glove again? It wouldn't make any sense anyways, so why not?

01:56:07.220 --> 01:56:12.220
Okay, the Power Glove allows you to play DDR with your hand.

01:56:12.220 --> 01:56:14.220
Like a virtual keyboard?

01:56:14.220 --> 01:56:17.220
Like, no, you can wave your hand, and it does things.

01:56:17.220 --> 01:56:18.220
You want a sad accent?

01:56:18.220 --> 01:56:20.220
Para, para, I don't know.

01:56:20.220 --> 01:56:25.220
For like half a second, I think, this week, while I was sitting there bored drooling in front of my computer monitor,

01:56:25.220 --> 01:56:29.220
I think I actually thought about trying to use the Power Glove in such fashion.

01:56:29.220 --> 01:56:33.220
Here we go. Here we go. I know how we can end the DDR movie, okay?

01:56:33.220 --> 01:56:36.220
So DDR Bot wins the tournament, okay?

01:56:36.220 --> 01:56:41.220
And then in this classic Hollywood ending, you know those things that would never happen in real life,

01:56:41.220 --> 01:56:44.220
this is what happens at the end of the movie. You ready for it?

01:56:44.220 --> 01:56:47.220
All the male DDR players get laid.

01:56:49.220 --> 01:56:50.220
Even better.

01:56:50.220 --> 01:56:53.220
Alien spacecraft come from the sky.

01:56:53.220 --> 01:56:55.220
We need you to come to save the world!

01:56:55.220 --> 01:56:59.120
yeah i could be like one of those really stupid movies like where you know music

01:56:59.120 --> 01:57:02.560
will save the world or something like that one of the alien movies

01:57:02.560 --> 01:57:05.520
the tv set a ddr to save the world

01:57:05.520 --> 01:57:06.880
yes

01:57:06.880 --> 01:57:08.640
the uh... to save the world

01:57:08.640 --> 01:57:11.280
and you can have a you can have really horrible riddant

01:57:11.280 --> 01:57:13.680
renditions of the ddr characters

01:57:13.680 --> 01:57:15.680
like a race like for instance

01:57:15.680 --> 01:57:16.400
you know

01:57:16.400 --> 01:57:17.880
you

01:57:17.880 --> 01:57:22.160
uh... kyle played by uh... sounds like what they have been okay with the

01:57:22.160 --> 01:57:25.160
I'm fucking paired, it's really enormous.

01:57:25.160 --> 01:57:29.160
Rage can be played by The Rock.

01:57:29.160 --> 01:57:34.160
And let's see, Emmy would be played by Angelina Jolie.

01:57:34.160 --> 01:57:36.160
I'm liking this so far.

01:57:36.160 --> 01:57:40.160
And they could be like the comic relief, like they show up along our journey

01:57:40.160 --> 01:57:45.160
and provide that random sage advice.

01:57:45.160 --> 01:57:48.160
I'm liking this, I'm going to go write this all down.

01:57:48.160 --> 01:57:54.160
Naoki will be played by Harvey Fierstein.

01:57:54.160 --> 01:58:02.160
Oh my god you guys! You've gotta go to the DDR tournament and play my song! Oh! I gotta call my mother!

01:58:02.160 --> 01:58:08.160
That would be hilarious to have some sort of arena, like Iron Chef, and he would be like the chairman.

01:58:08.160 --> 01:58:14.160
You know, cause he's flamboyant like the chairman.

01:58:14.160 --> 01:58:19.680
god it's wrong it's so wrong I feel so dirty all right all right

01:58:19.680 --> 01:58:24.400
we got comments in our chat room here DJ rama s says by the way there was a there

01:58:24.400 --> 01:58:29.520
was an actual DDR movie oh god we beat this thing into death it was really bad

01:58:29.520 --> 01:58:34.280
there was there was a plot written for one and Haley Jo Osment was cast for the

01:58:34.280 --> 01:58:36.960
role of the hero I don't believe that for half a second I'm sorry that's fake

01:58:36.960 --> 01:58:41.800
and Ron not knowing the issue nothing is you I don't know where you got that news

01:58:41.800 --> 01:58:48.920
from. Maybe it did come from a legitimate news source, but I'm sorry to say it's a pile

01:58:48.920 --> 01:58:49.920
of shit.

01:58:49.920 --> 01:58:50.920
Oh, come on! Look at this!

01:58:50.920 --> 01:58:57.280
Uh-oh! Yes! Did you know that the Dr. Movie, because DR, what are you looking at? You're

01:58:57.280 --> 01:58:59.960
looking at some page over on Tripod.

01:58:59.960 --> 01:59:03.640
It's shit. This is not... What the hell are these people doing?

01:59:03.640 --> 01:59:07.880
I think it's somebody having the same conversation on AOL that we just had, basically.

01:59:07.880 --> 01:59:08.880
Crap.

01:59:08.880 --> 01:59:16.600
miss cleo in their movie please please people please miss cleo is so three years ago okay

01:59:16.600 --> 01:59:25.280

01:59:25.280 --> 01:59:31.040
i like dj ron must like new idea because it's team ddr to battle team pump it up i'm down

01:59:31.040 --> 01:59:37.600
for that movie afro played by uh the whole 15 ml jackson the whole last 15 minutes the

01:59:37.600 --> 01:59:41.760
movie is them just serving each other back and forth

01:59:41.760 --> 01:59:46.200
i'd love it and they can shoot lasers when they have a combo or so i don't

01:59:46.200 --> 01:59:49.520
know it's fucking retarded okay alright we're gonna reopen up the skype

01:59:49.520 --> 01:59:54.080
actually i think about their is only one way that could there could be a d r

01:59:54.080 --> 01:59:56.360
movie and this could actually work

01:59:56.360 --> 01:59:58.920
now anyone out there probably read it

01:59:58.920 --> 02:00:02.340
it's um... the ten cake motion which is

02:00:02.340 --> 02:00:06.220
uh... web comic out there right now and that actually does have a story line

02:00:06.220 --> 02:00:09.100
it does involve DDR that would actually translate well into film.

02:00:09.100 --> 02:00:12.460
No, here it is, here it is. Kevin Smith writes a DDR movie.

02:00:12.460 --> 02:00:18.700
Oh God. And it's just about a bunch of slackers, which is true to life, that go to play DDR

02:00:18.700 --> 02:00:22.060
and just, you know, the wacky antics that ensue. There you go.

02:00:22.060 --> 02:00:28.300
Is it going to be called Hot Arrow Sex? With sex spelled, you know, S-E-C-X.

02:00:28.300 --> 02:00:32.060
There you go. See, I'm full of good ideas here. Just as

02:00:32.060 --> 02:00:39.060
This is the only thing. Joel Schumacher is not allowed to direct the DDR movie because he ruins everything he touches! Everything!

02:00:39.060 --> 02:00:45.060
He did not ruin the Phantom of the Opera. He put his poo on it a little bit.

02:00:45.060 --> 02:00:47.060
I did see the smearing of the poo.

02:00:47.060 --> 02:00:48.060
It could have been better.

02:00:48.060 --> 02:00:50.060
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

02:00:50.060 --> 02:00:51.060
Hey, what's up?

02:00:51.060 --> 02:00:53.060
Hi, who is this?

02:00:53.060 --> 02:00:54.060
Outface.

02:00:54.060 --> 02:00:57.060
Hi, Outface. Is this THE Outface?

02:00:57.060 --> 02:00:59.060
Oh my god, yes. Oh my god.

02:00:59.060 --> 02:01:01.060
Oh my god. I don't think you are.

02:01:01.060 --> 02:01:03.060
Alright, you have a comment?

02:01:03.060 --> 02:01:09.060
Um, that whole movie idea is just not really right. No.

02:01:09.060 --> 02:01:13.060
You know what? It's better than half the shit that Hollywood's putting out anyway.

02:01:13.060 --> 02:01:17.060
Did you see Crossroads? Did you see it?

02:01:17.060 --> 02:01:18.060
Yeah.

02:01:18.060 --> 02:01:22.060
Britney Spears, three friends, no. Forget it. I mean, come on.

02:01:22.060 --> 02:01:25.060
I would watch the DDR movie 20 times before I'd watch it.

02:01:25.060 --> 02:01:30.060
There's only one situation I want to see with Britney Spears and three friends, and that wasn't Crossroads.

02:01:30.060 --> 02:01:33.820
although crossroads could be a title

02:01:33.820 --> 02:01:39.820
i'm sorry michael did you have another comment

02:01:39.820 --> 02:01:40.800
how is it

02:01:40.800 --> 02:01:43.260
if you had to get a hell of a lot better actors then

02:01:43.260 --> 02:01:46.460
i know i know you'd have to get some decent actors we would just have to get

02:01:46.460 --> 02:01:51.100
unknowns basically it would star us is the deal

02:01:51.100 --> 02:01:53.980
how was your holiday

02:01:53.980 --> 02:01:56.700
that was alright did you get any good stuff

02:01:56.700 --> 02:01:59.780
did santa bring you some good stuff

02:01:59.780 --> 02:02:04.620
xbox about it but there you go are you gonna play ultra mix too

02:02:04.620 --> 02:02:06.380
not bloody likely

02:02:06.380 --> 02:02:11.260
any particular reason why

02:02:11.260 --> 02:02:14.220
do you even play ddr sir?

02:02:14.220 --> 02:02:17.500
do you even play ddr?

02:02:17.500 --> 02:02:18.380
yeah, ddr

02:02:18.380 --> 02:02:18.960
but

02:02:18.960 --> 02:02:19.820
ddr

02:02:19.820 --> 02:02:21.100
guitar freaks, crap like that

02:02:21.100 --> 02:02:24.580
there you go, but not interested in ultra mix too

02:02:24.580 --> 02:02:26.460
no not really

02:02:26.460 --> 02:02:29.660
It's not Japanese enough for you, or what's the deal?

02:02:29.660 --> 02:02:31.060
Eh, it was alright.

02:02:31.060 --> 02:02:35.860
Maybe it's the console that it plays on as the size of a house.

02:02:35.860 --> 02:02:39.760
Alright, then what games are you gonna play? Are you a Halo person? Is that what it's all about?

02:02:39.760 --> 02:02:43.760
Oh yeah, Halo is the shit. There you go, you're a Halo person. I understand that.

02:02:43.760 --> 02:02:46.720
I played Halo 2 for two weeks, and then I gave up.

02:02:46.720 --> 02:02:50.220
Cause I suck.

02:02:50.220 --> 02:02:53.220
Any New Year's resolutions you don't intend on keeping?

02:02:53.220 --> 02:02:55.320
Oh, hell yeah. Like what?

02:02:55.320 --> 02:02:58.320
I'm not spending so much money in the arcade, but that is so not going to work.

02:02:58.320 --> 02:03:01.320
It so doesn't work for me every year either.

02:03:01.320 --> 02:03:05.320
Unless the arcades turn to shit, then it's easy to not go.

02:03:05.320 --> 02:03:07.320
Or they get overrun with children.

02:03:09.320 --> 02:03:10.320
Anything else?

02:03:10.320 --> 02:03:13.320
Nah. Have a good one, boss.

02:03:13.320 --> 02:03:15.320
Alright, thanks for calling. Have a good one.

02:03:16.320 --> 02:03:17.320
Later.

02:03:18.320 --> 02:03:19.320
He had a lot of background noise.

02:03:19.320 --> 02:03:22.320
It sounded like he was calling us from the middle of a dishwasher. I don't know.

02:03:22.320 --> 02:03:24.320
We're in the middle of our hallway with the fan.

02:03:24.320 --> 02:03:50.320
The winner of tonight's cage match really shouldn't be too hard to figure out. You let the chat room pick, and the chat room wins.

02:03:50.320 --> 02:03:51.620
Yeah, I get to pick a better song.

02:03:51.620 --> 02:03:53.220
Ready, steady, go.

02:03:53.220 --> 02:03:55.020
In your face, Loki.

02:03:55.020 --> 02:03:55.920
In your face.

02:03:55.920 --> 02:03:57.620
You got served.

02:03:57.620 --> 02:03:59.220
I won last week, what do I care?

02:03:59.220 --> 02:04:00.420
I was making rice.

02:04:00.420 --> 02:04:02.220
I'm full, man.

02:04:02.220 --> 02:04:03.920
I am so goddamn full.

02:04:03.920 --> 02:04:04.920
Alright.

02:04:04.920 --> 02:04:06.020
We're gonna go to a break, you guys.

02:04:06.020 --> 02:04:09.520
When we come back, we are going to do the FUs of the week,

02:04:09.520 --> 02:04:13.320
and I know you guys have probably got quite a few things

02:04:13.320 --> 02:04:15.620
that you're a little bit angsty about this week,

02:04:15.620 --> 02:04:16.920
especially with the holidays.

02:04:16.920 --> 02:04:19.220
So go ahead and send in those FUs of the week now,

02:04:19.220 --> 02:04:25.980
And, uh, we'll get to those when we come back after this break, featuring music, since he kinda got me thinking about UltraMix 2.

02:04:25.980 --> 02:04:28.980
I think we're gonna play some stuff from UltraMix 2. How's that sound, you guys?

02:04:28.980 --> 02:04:31.080
I'm not...

02:04:31.080 --> 02:04:33.220
Shut up. We're gonna play some UltraMix 2 stuff and we'll be back.

02:04:33.220 --> 02:04:39.580
We're gonna start it off with I Feel, the junk circuit mix. We'll be back after this.

02:04:39.580 --> 02:04:41.580
Do you feel it?

02:05:41.580 --> 02:05:59.580
Can you hear it?

02:05:59.580 --> 02:06:01.580
Can you hear it?

02:06:31.580 --> 02:06:33.580
You

02:07:01.580 --> 02:07:08.580
Some people say I'm wasting time, but they don't really know

02:07:08.580 --> 02:07:14.580
Like what I see, see what I got, give me such a flow

02:07:14.580 --> 02:07:15.580
Hey, hey, hey

02:07:15.580 --> 02:07:21.580
I'm sitting on the Roman back porch, all by myself

02:07:21.580 --> 02:07:27.580
The Lord, the King, the Mary Jane, but I'm with somebody else

02:07:27.580 --> 02:07:34.580
Hey hey hey stop, look and listen baby, that's my philosophy

02:07:35.900 --> 02:07:42.900
It's called ruffin' neck and baby that's alright with me

02:07:43.680 --> 02:07:48.680
Hey hey hey baby that's alright with me

02:07:50.280 --> 02:07:55.420
Ruffin' neck and baby that's alright with me

02:08:25.420 --> 02:08:39.420
Maybe only the strongest survive Or the miseries of life

02:08:39.420 --> 02:08:51.420
Only factors to keep you away In the soul and feet of the broken shield

02:08:51.420 --> 02:08:57.420
Don't keep on lookin' the wrong way Don't stop, don't fear you'll run away

02:08:57.420 --> 02:09:01.420
The world is flying, baby, that's up to none

02:09:01.420 --> 02:09:06.420
Don't keep on living, don't stop, even the devil is free

02:09:06.420 --> 02:09:11.420
Get you in the seat of the top three, baby, that's up to none

02:09:11.420 --> 02:09:24.420
I need you there, cause I need you there all the time

02:09:24.420 --> 02:09:28.420
Cause I keep on lookin' up on me, thinkin' don't stop, don't free

02:09:28.420 --> 02:09:33.420
Run away from all the fire, baby I'm stuck tonight

02:09:33.420 --> 02:09:38.420
I keep on lookin' up on me, thinkin' don't stop, don't free

02:09:38.420 --> 02:09:47.420
So keep on living, don't stop giving them dabbles for free.

02:09:47.420 --> 02:09:55.420
Get your hands up in the heartbreak, baby, that's enough.

02:09:55.420 --> 02:09:57.420
Baby, that's enough.

02:09:57.420 --> 02:10:09.540
Orange Lounge Radio is proud to present a celebrity interview.

02:10:09.540 --> 02:10:11.380
Can you introduce yourself for our listeners?

02:10:11.380 --> 02:10:12.380
I'm Miss Cleo.

02:10:12.380 --> 02:10:14.580
Oh, it's great to have you on the show today.

02:10:14.580 --> 02:10:16.300
Hello, how are you today?

02:10:16.300 --> 02:10:17.300
I'm great, thanks.

02:10:17.300 --> 02:10:18.780
Did you have a question?

02:10:18.780 --> 02:10:21.340
Well, yes, actually I wanted to know.

02:10:21.340 --> 02:10:25.980
Can I please have your first name only and your birthdate, please?

02:10:25.980 --> 02:10:30.980
Uh, well, no. I actually just wanted to know what you thought of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:10:30.980 --> 02:10:31.980
Alright, go ahead.

02:10:31.980 --> 02:10:35.980
Well, what do you think of Loki, one of the three hosts of Orange Lounge Radio?

02:10:35.980 --> 02:10:36.980
Is he incarcerated?

02:10:36.980 --> 02:10:40.980
Uh, actually, no he's not. But what do you think of the ever-ranty Dark Zakra?

02:10:40.980 --> 02:10:42.980
Hi, dear. How are you?

02:10:42.980 --> 02:10:43.980
I love you.

02:10:43.980 --> 02:10:46.980
I see you two must know each other. Well, what do you think of Skye?

02:10:46.980 --> 02:10:48.980
Did he used to play football when he was in high school?

02:10:48.980 --> 02:10:50.980
Well, actually, no he didn't.

02:10:50.980 --> 02:10:51.980
Ha ha ha ha!

02:10:51.980 --> 02:10:53.980
Well, what do you think of Intern Zero?

02:10:53.980 --> 02:10:57.980
I want you to really remember the pill, all right?

02:10:57.980 --> 02:11:03.980
I'm seeing some forgetting, possibly, and I'm seeing a new baby in the next three months.

02:11:03.980 --> 02:11:07.980
Right. Okay, well, thanks for being on Orange Lounge Radio today.

02:11:07.980 --> 02:11:12.980
I don't mean to sidetrack your question here, but who are all of these nosy people,

02:11:12.980 --> 02:11:16.980
outside influences I'm seeing around you by the moon card?

02:11:16.980 --> 02:11:19.980
Get away from me.

02:11:19.980 --> 02:11:24.980
Orange Lounge Radio. Helping to free your mind and spirit.

02:11:24.980 --> 02:11:27.980
I'm Miss Cleo. I love you.

02:11:27.980 --> 02:11:31.980
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:11:31.980 --> 02:11:35.980
Yeah, that Miss Cleo thing. So four years ago, right?

02:11:35.980 --> 02:11:39.980
We can't hear you, buddy. Is the mic on?

02:11:39.980 --> 02:11:43.980
It's a dead mic, buddy. We can't hear you on it.

02:11:43.980 --> 02:11:47.980
That's our guest mic. It just doesn't work anymore.

02:11:47.980 --> 02:11:51.020
Holy shit, dude, that was funny as hell. I'd never heard it before

02:11:52.380 --> 02:11:56.800
That's pretty good. You know, it's old though because it talks about interns zero on there

02:11:56.800 --> 02:11:59.300
That guy's been m.i.a for like a year and a half now, so

02:12:00.300 --> 02:12:04.800
Yeah, I'd well we just haven't seen him here on orange launch radio quite some time. So that's too bad

02:12:04.940 --> 02:12:10.160
All right. Anyway, we are going to probably get into the F use of the week here pretty soon

02:12:10.380 --> 02:12:12.660
But I wanted to check in with Loki

02:12:13.500 --> 02:12:16.500
Who looks like he's purchasing Russian mp3s right now?

02:12:16.500 --> 02:12:21.780
now. Plenty of tattoo for everybody, no I'm kidding. I just want, excuse me, I have the

02:12:21.780 --> 02:12:26.140
hiccups here, so before I cough up a piece of rice here, uh, SimSceneNews, what's going

02:12:26.140 --> 02:12:36.780
on in the SimScene this week, my friend? Um, not a, still, DDR Maniacs is down and gone.

02:12:36.780 --> 02:12:43.900
Merry Christmas, it's not there anymore. DDR UK, they're saying that the UltraMix 2 and

02:12:43.900 --> 02:12:48.740
will be released when it's released. That's the official word.

02:12:48.740 --> 02:12:50.000
Um, they were

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:54.740
upgrading their servers, so I don't know what that means as far as release time.

02:12:54.740 --> 02:12:58.900
But it's still out there, still in limbo, should be almost done. I think they're just finishing up on

02:12:58.900 --> 02:12:59.700
basic,

02:12:59.700 --> 02:13:01.980
or not basic, the beginner steps.

02:13:01.980 --> 02:13:06.500
And that's pretty much it. Um, because now I guess there's beginner doubles

02:13:06.500 --> 02:13:09.140
from what I've heard. Um,

02:13:09.140 --> 02:13:12.860
so they're doing that and, um, other than that there's some pretty good stuff on

02:13:12.860 --> 02:13:19.060
Pomani style right now. Like I said, and I don't know why I do this, maybe as a service

02:13:19.060 --> 02:13:26.940
to the community or what, but I actually listen to every single Max remix that's submitted

02:13:26.940 --> 02:13:35.040
to Pomani style. And I'm afraid to say that nothing good has been recently submitted,

02:13:35.040 --> 02:13:39.940
sadly enough. But, there has been some good stuff. I'm trying to remember who submitted

02:13:39.940 --> 02:13:50.940
It was a, um, there was a remix of Healing Vision that was actually pretty good. It was, like, Healing Vision 2000, and I can't remember who submitted that, but I'm looking that up right now.

02:13:50.940 --> 02:14:01.940
Um, other than that, there was a few other sim files and a Stoic remix, um, there was, um, some other stuff, um, what was it, a, uh,

02:14:01.940 --> 02:14:11.940
Before You remix, and that was okay. But anyways, the guy I was talking about is, um, looks like DokoRowRider.

02:14:11.940 --> 02:14:21.940
And, um, he's got a bunch of cool sim files here, and you can go check them out. Um, you can actually, he's on the, like, the second or third page on there, and you'll see Healing Vision 2000.

02:14:21.940 --> 02:14:26.940
You can just, um, search under the author and pull up all of his files that he's made, and they're pretty good.

02:14:26.940 --> 02:14:35.940
And, um, I was playing, I forget what other one, I think it was the last DDR Extreme UK release or something like that.

02:14:35.940 --> 02:14:49.940
Um, or DDR something, I don't remember what it was, but anyways, it was, um, there were some videos, um, just like top 40 crap, and that was pretty cool too, I was playing those.

02:14:49.940 --> 02:14:56.940
But as far as anything major going on, nada. Nothing from last week. Nothing new.

02:14:56.940 --> 02:15:05.940
Oh, I guess there's some stupid, uh, there's some contest going on for myself about Rizlim and making sim files for that in the remix.

02:15:05.940 --> 02:15:11.940
Yeah. But anyways, other than that, nothing. Nothing else. So.

02:15:11.940 --> 02:15:18.940
But definitely check out the sim files I recommended and, um, yeah. That's it.

02:15:18.940 --> 02:15:23.660
Alrighty, well, sounds like the Sims scene is kind of on vacation for Christmas there.

02:15:23.660 --> 02:15:27.620
It's too bad about, I'm noticing a lot of Belmondy sites are down lately. Jason was

02:15:27.620 --> 02:15:33.420
pointing a few out to me before the show. They're grooved stats, down. DM Ashura, down.

02:15:33.420 --> 02:15:39.140
So, what can you do? It happens. Bandwidth kind of stinks. Very interesting. I'm surprised

02:15:39.140 --> 02:15:43.740
there are no official, or well, there isn't going to be official, but nobody has put together

02:15:43.740 --> 02:15:46.700
their Ultramix 2.0 steps files yet. Nobody's done that?

02:15:46.700 --> 02:15:52.820
DDR-UK is on top of it. They will be done soon. I think they are done right now. The

02:15:52.820 --> 02:15:58.620
problem with them is they have so many people working on submitting stuff. They are like

02:15:58.620 --> 02:16:02.460
perfectionists when it comes to this stuff, so they're not going to release it until it's

02:16:02.460 --> 02:16:06.740
perfect. So, you know, that's good to know, but it will take a little longer to release.

02:16:06.740 --> 02:16:12.180
That's all. I remember though, Loki, when DDR Max USA or something came out, you did

02:16:12.180 --> 02:16:15.900
a half-assed job. It was pretty decent. You had everything ripped, you had the song, you

02:16:15.900 --> 02:16:21.900
had the steps. It worked for me. You had it out within days. But these guys, it's been

02:16:21.900 --> 02:16:26.820
a couple months now. That's because I just don't give a damn anymore. I could have had

02:16:26.820 --> 02:16:30.780
these out a couple days after it came out, but I just don't give a damn because they

02:16:30.780 --> 02:16:36.460
have better ways of doing it now that with UltraMix and on the Xbox, there's actual ways

02:16:36.460 --> 02:16:43.560
it can rip the files straight from there so you get, you know, perfect music rips, perfect

02:16:43.560 --> 02:16:49.680
graphic rips. I just am not interested anymore. I don't really care about ripping files because

02:16:49.680 --> 02:16:53.720
I know someone will eventually do it and it's not a big deal to me. I played them on the

02:16:53.720 --> 02:17:02.360
Xbox, whatever. I don't really care anymore. All right, well let's move on to the FUs of

02:17:02.360 --> 02:17:07.000
the week, shall we? This is the part of the show where we get a little bit ranty, and

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:10.780
this is the part where I would ask Jamie, why is it that we do the FUs every week? And

02:17:10.780 --> 02:17:33.660
she would say something like, because we're not going to take it anymore.

02:17:33.660 --> 02:17:38.140
Obviously Dark Sacra is not here tonight, she's sick, we hope she gets better soon.

02:17:38.140 --> 02:17:45.260
So on Dark Sakura's behalf, I will give an F.U. to viruses and diseases that won't go

02:17:45.260 --> 02:17:50.660
away and things that ruin your Christmas season because you're sick.

02:17:50.660 --> 02:17:51.660
That sounds pretty fair.

02:17:51.660 --> 02:17:58.500
Oh, and because Dark Sakura usually has the F.U. to stupid drivers, F.U. to unruly children's

02:17:58.500 --> 02:18:03.300
parents, and F.U. to stupid people that call her at work.

02:18:03.300 --> 02:18:04.300
About to wrap it up?

02:18:04.300 --> 02:18:05.300
Sounds good to me.

02:18:05.300 --> 02:18:09.140
lucky

02:18:09.140 --> 02:18:10.420
okay

02:18:10.420 --> 02:18:12.420
first off

02:18:12.420 --> 02:18:14.660
like that don't you

02:18:14.660 --> 02:18:17.900
first off fuck you to slow ass drivers

02:18:17.900 --> 02:18:21.580
i felt like i was stuck inside the movie office space today

02:18:21.580 --> 02:18:25.780
you know fucking driving in a lane the guy is driving so damn slow

02:18:25.780 --> 02:18:29.540
you go around him into the next lane then that guy slows down the other guy speeds up

02:18:29.540 --> 02:18:32.740
go back the other guy slows down the other guy speeds up

02:18:32.740 --> 02:18:34.420
I just wasn't winning today at all.

02:18:34.420 --> 02:18:36.980
Then there's the people that don't fucking look where they're going.

02:18:36.980 --> 02:18:38.420
Then they just turn in front of you and they're,

02:18:38.420 --> 02:18:39.460
Oh!

02:18:39.460 --> 02:18:40.420
Abby, hit me!

02:18:40.420 --> 02:18:41.540
That's your fault.

02:18:41.540 --> 02:18:42.540
I'm going.

02:18:42.540 --> 02:18:44.980
Because I have my truck.

02:18:44.980 --> 02:18:46.700
And I support Bush.

02:18:46.700 --> 02:18:50.380
Therefore, I'm going.

02:18:50.380 --> 02:18:52.660
I don't know, whatever. They're stupid.

02:18:52.660 --> 02:18:54.580
Stupid jaywalkers. They're like,

02:18:54.580 --> 02:18:55.980
Oh, I almost got hit.

02:18:55.980 --> 02:18:59.060
Well, you know, you should maybe cross

02:18:59.060 --> 02:19:00.260
the crosswalk

02:19:00.260 --> 02:19:01.660
or on a corner.

02:19:01.660 --> 02:19:05.300
the fall of the traffic laws

02:19:05.300 --> 02:19:08.060
uh... but people believe that

02:19:08.060 --> 02:19:09.220
where they need to be

02:19:09.220 --> 02:19:12.860
when i feel these people breaking the law as far as

02:19:12.860 --> 02:19:15.460
turning left on you know

02:19:15.460 --> 02:19:16.700
right turn only

02:19:16.700 --> 02:19:19.440
you know when the stuff like that

02:19:19.440 --> 02:19:22.180
and they're fucking just never there but i don't

02:19:22.180 --> 02:19:23.660
and jerry

02:19:23.660 --> 02:19:25.140
did you start

02:19:25.140 --> 02:19:29.240
haven't prepared you read a stoplight in front of the christie cream

02:19:29.240 --> 02:19:32.860
heaven forbid that happened, you know, then you're fucked.

02:19:32.860 --> 02:19:34.120
But anyways,

02:19:34.120 --> 02:19:35.720
um, also,

02:19:35.720 --> 02:19:37.900
fuck you to the lack of pants.

02:19:37.900 --> 02:19:42.920
I need more pants. I'm running low on pants, and that makes me sad. I only got this year

02:19:42.920 --> 02:19:44.760
for Christmas with shirts,

02:19:44.760 --> 02:19:48.360
when I need pants to go with those shirts.

02:19:48.360 --> 02:19:51.720
So, god dammit, no pants makes me sad.

02:19:51.720 --> 02:19:53.620
And, um, also,

02:19:53.620 --> 02:19:59.160
fuck you to the lack of parties in Final Fantasy XI, because I have to wait for hours at a time,

02:19:59.160 --> 02:20:06.240
my Mario 64 on my DS while waiting, you know, to get a party because it's taking forever.

02:20:06.240 --> 02:20:10.400
And retarded people, because retarded people must play online games for some reason. Somehow

02:20:10.400 --> 02:20:15.160
they make it through, much like society where, you know, some people somehow make it through

02:20:15.160 --> 02:20:20.000
our education system despite the fact that you're retarded. I guess we need someone to

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:36.120
with the burgers then, don't we? And I'm all done. I'd like to put an F.U. out to the chair

02:20:36.120 --> 02:20:40.720
that collapsed under the weight of my own ass. I'd like to put an F.U. out to Wal-Mart

02:20:40.720 --> 02:20:44.720
for producing that chair. I'd like to give an F.U. to myself for shopping at Wal-Mart

02:20:44.720 --> 02:20:49.840
when I purchased that chair. I'd like to give an F.U. to Best Buy. What the fuck kind of

02:20:49.840 --> 02:20:53.740
store doesn't have shopping carts when I need them I asked if I could have a

02:20:53.740 --> 02:20:57.100
shopping cart and they looked at me like I was a damn foreigner speaking another

02:20:57.100 --> 02:21:02.940
language I've seen shopping carts at Best Buy's before oh I know why you

02:21:02.940 --> 02:21:06.280
don't have any shopping carts right now because you're putting all your fucking

02:21:06.280 --> 02:21:10.940
clearance items in there you guys sell tables put all the clearance item on a

02:21:10.940 --> 02:21:17.080
table and let me have the damn shopping cart because of your ass I had to carry

02:21:17.080 --> 02:21:21.080
That was not fair.

02:21:21.080 --> 02:21:25.080
And also F you to the fact that there was nobody around willing to help me out.

02:21:25.080 --> 02:21:29.080
So when I walked over to the other department I found another guy

02:21:29.080 --> 02:21:33.080
I said hey could you help me get this chair and he's just like.

02:21:33.080 --> 02:21:37.080
Well that's not my department. Let me see if I can find somebody who can help you.

02:21:37.080 --> 02:21:41.080
So I went over to the other department.

02:21:41.080 --> 02:21:45.080
My department ends like about an inch away from where you're at.

02:21:45.080 --> 02:21:51.560
You see, if you look at the markings on the floor, this is the car stereo department in

02:21:51.560 --> 02:21:52.560
the blue area, okay?

02:21:52.560 --> 02:21:56.000
And where you are, in the white area, that's home furnishing.

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:59.280
This is my department, and you're in that department, okay, so I can't help you even

02:21:59.280 --> 02:22:01.280
though I'm five feet away from you, okay?

02:22:01.280 --> 02:22:02.280
Okay, sorry.

02:22:02.280 --> 02:22:03.280
Sorry.

02:22:03.280 --> 02:22:08.720
So I finally had to go over to the dishwasher area to get some guy to help me, and he was

02:22:08.720 --> 02:22:13.600
kind enough to get up on the ladder, bring down the chair for me, and he even rung it

02:22:13.600 --> 02:22:18.300
up right there so I didn't have to stand in that atrocious line, and the chair only cost

02:22:18.300 --> 02:22:22.540
half as much as we thought it would. So thank you to that guy, and unfortunately I did not

02:22:22.540 --> 02:22:27.540
catch the guy's name, but I will know him in the future, because he's the only black

02:22:27.540 --> 02:22:30.700
guy I've ever seen working at a Best Buy. Ever.

02:22:30.700 --> 02:22:40.700
Also, I'd like to give an F.U. to the fact that I have to go back to work tomorrow, because

02:22:40.700 --> 02:22:49.700
And I'd like to give an FU to Nintendo for putting out a DS before they had any really good games really available for it.

02:22:49.700 --> 02:23:00.700
And FU to Ping Pals because it's not even a game. It's like, I mean, not that I haven't kind of been playing it because I'm addicted to the top ten game they have in it.

02:23:00.700 --> 02:23:04.700
But what the hell? When do I get to blow something up? That's not cool.

02:23:04.700 --> 02:23:13.700
Alright, anyway, let's move on and we'll move on to Darkchild, who will remember that it's only a three-hour show. He's worse than Jonas, boys and girls.

02:23:15.700 --> 02:23:21.700
The following views are the expressed views of me, Darkchild, and are not at all endorsed by Orange Lounge Radio.

02:23:22.700 --> 02:23:30.700
Fuck you to Daniel. I don't know, you're not on these forums or nothin', I don't think you listen, so I don't give a fuck. Fuck you.

02:23:30.700 --> 02:23:35.700
You. You know, you say you know what the fuck I'm going through and how the fuck you do that shit this summer.

02:23:35.700 --> 02:23:39.700
Fuck you, man. I fucking despise you.

02:23:39.700 --> 02:23:43.700
You went after a woman who had a man. Fuck you.

02:23:43.700 --> 02:23:48.700
Fuck you to my mother for giving me a shitty ass gift.

02:23:48.700 --> 02:23:53.700
You know, she gave me calling cards because I racked up a phone bill with my girlfriend a month ago.

02:23:53.700 --> 02:23:57.700
You know, about six hundred to eight hundred dollar phone bill. So I get calling cards for Christmas.

02:23:57.700 --> 02:24:02.140
Christmas. She bought them three days after my girlfriend broke up with me, so uh, fuck

02:24:02.140 --> 02:24:09.380
you, Moe. Nice gift. Fuck you to some stupid ass on File Planet who posted up my friend's

02:24:09.380 --> 02:24:16.380
GTA San Andreas, or GTA Vice City video, as though it was GTA San Andreas video made in

02:24:16.380 --> 02:24:21.280
Legos and taking credit for doing it himself instead of my friend doing it. And also fuck

02:24:21.280 --> 02:24:25.580
you to File Planet because that video was posted, now Brickclick.com has gone over bandwidth

02:24:25.580 --> 02:24:31.260
so I can't even check that site out. And finally, fuck you to the turn of events that have occurred

02:24:31.260 --> 02:24:36.980
in my life. I thought I had more time to change things, apparently I don't, so fuck you to

02:24:36.980 --> 02:24:41.420
life in general. That's all, have a nice day.

02:24:41.420 --> 02:24:44.420
Alrighty, let's move on then to the chatroom FUs.

02:24:44.420 --> 02:24:52.420
Ahh, DDR Angel says, F you to having no internet from Wednesday to Saturday, F you to being

02:24:52.420 --> 02:24:56.540
sicker than hell on Christmas and f you to not being able to spend time with my

02:24:56.540 --> 02:25:07.240
friends on Christmas but I was with you all in spirit oh sorry hairball out phase

02:25:07.240 --> 02:25:14.140
would like to say fuck you to DDR extreme USA very short and sweet dark

02:25:14.140 --> 02:25:19.180
night says f you to too much damn Christmas movies all week long I mean

02:25:19.180 --> 02:25:24.780
And I'm tired of A Christmas Story. 24 hours. Damn.

02:25:24.780 --> 02:25:28.580
You know what, I agree. A Christmas Story, one of the greatest Christmas

02:25:28.580 --> 02:25:31.820
if not movies, but Christmas movies of all time.

02:25:31.820 --> 02:25:36.460
We used to watch it every Christmas Eve, but goddamn has that movie even played out.

02:25:36.460 --> 02:25:41.300
It's time for them to make a sequel or a remake or do a new Christmas movie that we can all

02:25:41.300 --> 02:25:48.300
relate to with a dysfunctional family. Jaded2004 says, F you to the person who wished

02:25:48.300 --> 02:25:56.780
who wished for a white Christmas cuz we got two feet of snow and DJ Rama s says

02:25:56.780 --> 02:26:01.340

you all smirk jerk all right that's it pretty short on the F use tonight oh

02:26:15.140 --> 02:26:21.140
Oh, there might be a couple more. Actually, I don't think so. I think that's about it.

02:26:21.140 --> 02:26:28.140
Oh, no. Outfaze wanted to add a fuck you to DDR Freak for no good reason, apparently.

02:26:28.140 --> 02:26:31.140
So just a general F.U. I guess he was banned. I don't know.

02:26:31.140 --> 02:26:36.140
Then I'll just add a for no reason a fuck you to Jason Coe and I don't know why.

02:26:36.140 --> 02:26:43.140
Aren't you kind and generous and full of love. You know this show is played on DDR Freak occasionally?

02:26:43.140 --> 02:26:47.140
Isn't that kind of shooting us in the foot there, you dumbass?

02:26:47.140 --> 02:26:51.140
I gave a disclaimer about my statements already.

02:26:51.140 --> 02:26:55.140
Loki?

02:26:55.140 --> 02:26:59.140
There's a new quest in Final Fantasy 11

02:26:59.140 --> 02:27:03.140
that they just started after the Kristen event ended

02:27:03.140 --> 02:27:07.140
with goblins that ride chocobos.

02:27:07.140 --> 02:27:11.140
Who cares? I do!

02:27:11.140 --> 02:27:17.580
has a late F.U. that I'm just now getting. F.U. to Nintendo for making the DS $20 more

02:27:17.580 --> 02:27:24.060
than how much money I got for Christmas. Oh, that's too bad. Sucks to be you. Now I'm getting

02:27:24.060 --> 02:27:29.300
all these F.U.s. You guys are late. You're tardy. Sign in, please. Misty says I can't

02:27:29.300 --> 02:27:33.740
be in an F.U. mood because I got to play in the groove today. And Outface says there was

02:27:33.740 --> 02:27:39.660
no reason behind his F.U. to D.E.R. freak. He's just bored. And I know when I'm bored,

02:27:39.660 --> 02:27:44.660
I just sit here and think to myself, God, fuck DDR Freak. I mean, they ruined my life.

02:27:44.660 --> 02:27:49.660
What? I don't get it. I'm a dark child.

02:27:49.660 --> 02:27:54.660
I understand, you know. I just throw out fuck yous to random people at times.

02:27:54.660 --> 02:27:59.660
Shut the fuck up!

02:27:59.660 --> 02:28:04.660
Fuck you, Rob.

02:28:04.660 --> 02:28:09.500
on the radio because I can. Fuck, fuckity, fuck, fuck, fuck. On that note, I think it's

02:28:09.500 --> 02:28:14.420
a very good time to go to a break. What do you guys think? You guys don't fucking care.

02:28:14.420 --> 02:28:20.200
All right, we're going to go to a break. When we come back, more randomness here on Orange

02:28:20.200 --> 02:28:25.020
Lounge Radio. In this break, since I think it seems appropriate, we're going to do some

02:28:25.020 --> 02:28:32.760
music from DDR Extreme USA. How's that sound? Tee-hee. And we'll be back after this bit

02:28:32.760 --> 02:28:39.760
bit of music enjoy your listening to orange lounge radio

02:29:32.760 --> 02:29:37.760
I bet you finally, I'm gonna be angry tonight, oh

02:29:37.760 --> 02:29:44.760
I bet you find the end to deny it

02:29:44.760 --> 02:29:46.760
Oh

02:29:46.760 --> 02:30:14.120
Some little toy, some little toy It's comin' back to day to night

02:30:14.120 --> 02:30:16.120
So little time, so little time

02:30:16.120 --> 02:30:17.620
He asked for me

02:30:17.620 --> 02:30:19.620
So little hope, so little hope

02:30:19.620 --> 02:30:21.620
And I'm praying for love

02:30:24.620 --> 02:30:26.620
So little time, so little time

02:30:26.620 --> 02:30:28.120
But not so late

02:30:28.120 --> 02:30:30.120
A thousand years, a thousand days

02:30:30.120 --> 02:30:31.620
So give me love

02:30:31.620 --> 02:30:33.620
I'm coming in the dark

02:30:33.620 --> 02:30:35.620
I'm praying for love

02:30:35.620 --> 02:30:37.620
Love

02:30:37.620 --> 02:30:38.620
Praying for love

02:30:38.620 --> 02:30:40.620
Love, love, love

02:30:40.620 --> 02:30:42.620
So leave me alone

02:30:42.620 --> 02:30:44.620
Love

02:30:44.620 --> 02:30:46.620
Say baby love

02:30:46.620 --> 02:30:48.620
Love

02:30:48.620 --> 02:30:50.920
Say baby love

02:30:50.920 --> 02:30:52.220
Love

02:30:52.220 --> 02:30:55.220
Say baby love

02:30:55.220 --> 02:30:57.220
More than love

02:30:57.220 --> 02:30:59.220
Yeah yeah

02:30:59.220 --> 02:31:01.220
Say baby love

02:31:01.220 --> 02:31:02.420
Yeah yeah

02:31:02.420 --> 02:31:04.820
Say baby love

02:31:04.820 --> 02:31:06.820
Yeah yeah

02:31:06.820 --> 02:31:08.420
To love

02:31:08.420 --> 02:31:10.420
Yep to love

02:31:10.420 --> 02:31:12.420
If they feel loved

02:31:12.420 --> 02:31:36.420
Simply being loved, is more than enough

02:31:42.420 --> 02:32:00.420
You touched my body once, it burns, you still assault me

02:32:00.420 --> 02:32:06.420
Never forget, never again will be

02:32:07.420 --> 02:32:09.420
I cry

02:32:10.420 --> 02:32:13.420
Out of my head

02:32:14.420 --> 02:32:19.420
And I don't know what I found

02:32:20.420 --> 02:32:24.420
Over and over

02:32:24.420 --> 02:32:40.420
I'm waiting for a gentle wave, a gentle wave, a gentle wave

02:32:40.420 --> 02:32:45.420
I'm a sidewalk, I'm a city, I'm a tree, just a whisper

02:32:45.420 --> 02:32:50.420
Busy people, going nowhere, see me soaking my rain

02:32:50.420 --> 02:32:55.420
No compassion, nothing matters, my resistance is waning

02:32:55.420 --> 02:33:04.420
Like a flower in a basement waiting for our long ranges

02:33:13.420 --> 02:33:19.420
Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song, Orange Lounge Radio

02:33:19.420 --> 02:33:24.420
We are back here on Orange Launch Radio. We've got about a half hour of show left to kill here.

02:33:24.420 --> 02:33:28.420
What are we going to do? I don't know, we're going crazy here.

02:33:28.420 --> 02:33:33.420
You can join us in chatroom, www.orangelaunchradio.com, we've got chat.

02:33:33.420 --> 02:33:38.420
You know, we're just kind of running on lower batteries than usual,

02:33:38.420 --> 02:33:43.420
just because we're down one host, A, although Darkchild is kind enough to be here filling in tonight,

02:33:43.420 --> 02:33:47.420
and B, just the fact that we've only probably got about half the people listening that we usually do,

02:33:47.420 --> 02:33:50.620
usually do, so we don't have quite as much interaction as we're used to. But that's alright,

02:33:50.620 --> 02:33:55.820
we do appreciate those of you guys that came out on this evening to show up and support

02:33:55.820 --> 02:34:00.740
Orange Lounge Radio, it happens. What kind of stuff are you looking at over there, Loki?

02:34:00.740 --> 02:34:04.140
I noticed you were reading something about, now this has nothing to do with Balmani, but

02:34:04.140 --> 02:34:11.460
a lot of people say ZSNES. Oh, the first release in two and a half years for ZSNES has been

02:34:11.460 --> 02:34:15.540
released with a bunch of, like, fixes and crap. So I'm just checking that out. I'm just

02:34:15.540 --> 02:34:25.540
I'm reading Slashdot, because that's what I do, and they have an article. They had one that's at the very bottom of the page, actually, that's about overclocking a Nintendo entertainment system.

02:34:25.540 --> 02:34:34.540
Yes, you can overclock an NES. Why the fuck would you want to overclock an NES? You know, an NES is beyond me.

02:34:34.540 --> 02:34:42.540
They did mention, though, that there are some games, though, that lagged out, normally. You can play them without lag, though. But, um, other games just fuck up.

02:34:42.540 --> 02:34:46.540
But that was the best part about the Nintendo system, was the games that glitched out.

02:34:46.540 --> 02:34:52.040
We would get games dirty just to play them so they would glitch out, and it's like a whole new challenge.

02:34:52.040 --> 02:35:00.040
Akari Wars, man, so many hours of entertainment played, you know, just from that game glitching out.

02:35:00.040 --> 02:35:05.540
Oh, hey, look, Player One just fell behind the backdrop, and now he's running underneath everything.

02:35:06.540 --> 02:35:09.540
It was so much fun, and it's just crazy.

02:35:09.540 --> 02:35:13.540
Why didn't you just start putting random codes in the Game Genie?

02:35:13.540 --> 02:35:17.540
I did that what Ninja Guy did.

02:35:17.540 --> 02:35:21.540
It was cool. The game worked fine when I was running and shooting ninja stars and stuff.

02:35:21.540 --> 02:35:25.540
But the moment I jumped, I went under the stage and somehow

02:35:25.540 --> 02:35:29.540
flew to the end of the stage, but still under the ground.

02:35:29.540 --> 02:35:33.540
This is so much shit that's glitched out. Those are the

02:35:33.540 --> 02:35:37.540
days. Now we have these new games

02:35:37.540 --> 02:35:57.540
That game is so awful. I need to play some Driver 3 tonight. I've decided I've got to go back and play that game just because it's so bad and so glitchy that it's worth it.

02:35:57.540 --> 02:36:02.780
Oh, and there's another thing here. You know how they have all those free iPod links?

02:36:02.780 --> 02:36:05.620
I'm really curious about this article. I'm looking on Slashdot. I'm actually clicking

02:36:05.620 --> 02:36:09.100
on it, trying to find out more about what's going on here, because I know this is a big

02:36:09.100 --> 02:36:13.060
thing going on right now, and on all the DDR sites, you see it in people's signatures.

02:36:13.060 --> 02:36:18.460
Win, win a free iPod! Or, not win, but, you know, sign up for this crap and get a free

02:36:18.460 --> 02:36:22.900
iPod. Sign up for this and that and get a free iPod. But, it's actually worked. We know

02:36:22.900 --> 02:36:27.340
people that have gotten free iPods because of it so you can't deny that the

02:36:27.340 --> 02:36:31.540
system works. So I'm kind of wondering what I'm seeing here on Slashdot about

02:36:31.540 --> 02:36:34.500
what is this? They're saying there's fine print or something? Are they gonna have to

02:36:34.500 --> 02:36:37.980
give the iPods back? What's going on? Are they gonna charge credit card

02:36:37.980 --> 02:36:41.580
unknowingly or something? What's going on? No, I'm not. I'm making that stuff up. But

02:36:41.580 --> 02:36:45.260
I'm kind of curious. What's the hidden message here on the iPod thing?

02:36:45.260 --> 02:36:50.940
Now, granted I myself I wanted an iPod. I just ended up buying one. It was a

02:36:50.940 --> 02:36:56.000
Christmas presents myself, whereas I probably could have done the refer six friends and

02:36:56.000 --> 02:37:02.480
get one thing. I just, I get nervous about that kind of stuff. I mean, and there's nothing

02:37:02.480 --> 02:37:06.460
against you if you want to do it and stuff, but it just, it makes me nervous, like giving

02:37:06.460 --> 02:37:10.760
my, I mean, and granted I could set up a fake email address or just put the one down where

02:37:10.760 --> 02:37:18.960
I get all my spam anyway, but I just kind of go, eh, something, I feel like, it's just

02:37:18.960 --> 02:37:22.160
too good to be true. You know what I mean? It's just too damn good to be true. There's

02:37:22.160 --> 02:37:26.260
got to be something hidden. And even though I have no right to think that because I know

02:37:26.260 --> 02:37:32.720
people that have done this and have gotten away with it, I just, what the hell? Any thoughts

02:37:32.720 --> 02:37:34.280
I'll give you? Have you been able to find anything on this?

02:37:34.280 --> 02:37:42.280
No. I don't really care. I don't do these. I don't, you know, I just don't buy this stuff

02:37:42.280 --> 02:37:52.680
and I really, you know, I don't know, whatever. I personally do not want an iPod and, I don't

02:37:52.680 --> 02:37:58.760
know. Whoa. Oh, yeah. I forgot to mention, there is also a site that gives away free

02:37:58.760 --> 02:38:05.800
money. Free money. Free money. Free money for doing this iPod thing. In fact, this person

02:38:05.800 --> 02:38:10.600
right here is just saying, this one link that they had on there, that was saying, just wanted

02:38:10.600 --> 02:38:28.600
I wanted to add one more thing. I got off the phone with my girlfriend. She received a $500 gift card from IRC a few days ago. Now she's $550 richer. I think I can say with absolute certainty that the Incentive Rewards Center is both legitimate and attentive to their customers.

02:38:28.600 --> 02:38:35.600
I don't know what the fuck the, the um, whatever, the IRC, incentive reward center, whatever.

02:38:35.600 --> 02:38:51.600
But um, I don't know. Whatever, I mean, if you want to go ahead and risk it, try to get free shit, just know for a fact, and this is pure economics, nothing in life is free.

02:38:51.600 --> 02:38:56.800
Does it say in the small print, like somebody's suggesting in the chat room here, I think

02:38:56.800 --> 02:39:01.660
it's a moo in the chat room right now, says, I think people are unknowingly selling their

02:39:01.660 --> 02:39:05.240
souls for those free iPods. Is there something in the small print about having to give up

02:39:05.240 --> 02:39:09.480
your soul? Because seriously, where are they, I mean, I understand where they're making

02:39:09.480 --> 02:39:12.920
the money. They're making their money off the people that can only refer four friends

02:39:12.920 --> 02:39:17.360
and can't get that fifth friend, as frustrating as it must be to them or whatever. That's

02:39:17.360 --> 02:39:22.500
So they're making their money, but I don't know.

02:39:22.500 --> 02:39:26.320
What I think it is is they're not paying some kind of research firm to give them a bunch

02:39:26.320 --> 02:39:27.320
of email addresses.

02:39:27.320 --> 02:39:32.840
Instead, it's much cheaper than to just give out iPods to get the email addresses.

02:39:32.840 --> 02:39:36.000
But everybody's giving a fake email address.

02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:39.280
Everybody I know who's done this hasn't used their real email address.

02:39:39.280 --> 02:39:44.000
So you know, I don't know.

02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:45.000
Weird stuff.

02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:53.000
Alright, well maybe one day I'll participate in one of these get rich quick schemes for the sake of the show and I'll let you know how it goes.

02:39:53.000 --> 02:40:00.000
It's kind of funny though, we're having all this chatting about iPods because of something that I'm not going to talk about right now.

02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:05.000
But it's just interesting that we're having all this talk about iPods.

02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:07.000
Yes, it was creative foreshadowing.

02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:10.000
Alright, now people think we're going to be giving away iPods.

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:13.000
No, sorry, we don't have the budget for that, sorry.

02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:24.960
I have an iPod, and I like my iPod. It's cool. It does bang up a little easy, though, because

02:40:24.960 --> 02:40:28.040
you'll notice now, granted, I don't have a protective case or anything, and I do take

02:40:28.040 --> 02:40:31.520
this to my car with me, but you'll notice there's already little scratches there showing

02:40:31.520 --> 02:40:35.780
up on the screen, and look at this. Look at this. Right there, where the dot meets the

02:40:35.780 --> 02:40:41.500
wheel there a little bit of a bit of stripping there of the cheap plastic

02:40:41.500 --> 02:40:47.620
iPods are like Korean horse to me I'm not touching them because they're dirty

02:40:50.100 --> 02:40:57.700
Wow you know what though I figured that you know now the chat rooms all teasing

02:40:57.700 --> 02:41:00.660
me because I went and bought an iPod and I could have gotten a free one but you

02:41:00.660 --> 02:41:06.660
You know what? It felt good to walk into the Apple store and walk in there and lay my credit

02:41:06.660 --> 02:41:12.580
card down and go, Daddy wants an iPod today. Can you gift wrap it for me so I can take

02:41:12.580 --> 02:41:14.740
it home and open it up and make it feel like it's Christmas?

02:41:14.740 --> 02:41:22.420
I don't know. Now we've started this war about all these

02:41:22.420 --> 02:41:26.660
other multimedia devices that are supposedly better than iPods. You know what? That's great.

02:41:26.660 --> 02:41:31.520
That's just fabulous. Have fun with your devices. I am more than happy with my freaking iPod.

02:41:31.520 --> 02:41:32.520
Thank you.

02:41:32.520 --> 02:41:37.860
You know what rocks? It's the greatest thing ever. It's called an MP3C player. Okay? You

02:41:37.860 --> 02:41:44.840
put it in your car and you can burn MP3s to a disk and you can play like hours and hours

02:41:44.840 --> 02:41:52.200
of stuff. And guess what? They only cost like $20. Don't buy the iPod. Do not subject yourself

02:41:52.200 --> 02:41:56.320
to something that looks cute. Cuteness does not mean functional.

02:41:56.320 --> 02:42:02.840
Haha, I need to interrupt here for a minute. I had the MP3 CD player in my car, it worked

02:42:02.840 --> 02:42:06.440
for a week, and then it didn't work anymore. That's why they're so cheap, because they

02:42:06.440 --> 02:42:09.800
don't fucking work. And you burn them, and then they skip all the time because you have

02:42:09.800 --> 02:42:13.200
them sitting on the seat, or wherever I would stick that thing, it would skip, skip, skip,

02:42:13.200 --> 02:42:19.220
skip, because MP3 CDs just... Bullshit! No, you're bullshit! Those CD players have like

02:42:19.220 --> 02:42:23.780
a two-minute skip time. You'd have to literally throw that out of a plane for the skip.

02:42:23.780 --> 02:42:28.980
Hey, speaking of iPods, did they ever fix the battery problem with the iPods? Because

02:42:28.980 --> 02:42:34.060
if not, you know, you're going to get, like, 16 months use out of it, and then you're screwed.

02:42:34.060 --> 02:42:37.540
You're fucked. Supposedly, yes, they fixed the battery problem

02:42:37.540 --> 02:42:41.100
with the iPods, but this is why I bought my iPod at the official Apple store, so that

02:42:41.100 --> 02:42:44.500
if anything goes wrong with it, I will take it back and demand a new one. But the battery

02:42:44.500 --> 02:42:46.900
life, it could be better.

02:42:46.900 --> 02:42:52.060
Well, seeing as the dude's got the official response from Apple's customer service saying

02:42:52.060 --> 02:42:55.820
that he had to purchase a brand new one or a refurbed one because they don't have replacement

02:42:55.820 --> 02:42:59.260
batteries and they won't replace them, I don't think buying it from the Apple store will

02:42:59.260 --> 02:43:00.260
matter.

02:43:00.260 --> 02:43:04.820
No, from what I understand, they do the replacement battery thing now.

02:43:04.820 --> 02:43:06.220
They do that.

02:43:06.220 --> 02:43:10.380
And I know that they, I asked about it and they said that they sell the batteries or

02:43:10.380 --> 02:43:11.380
something like that now.

02:43:11.380 --> 02:43:12.380
So, suck it.

02:43:12.380 --> 02:43:21.300
suck it. Big old untrue rumor for 2005 DDR game coming to the N-Gage. Oh, N-Gage best

02:43:21.300 --> 02:43:30.740
selling game system ever also, just so you know. What? I said untrue. Is somebody actually

02:43:30.740 --> 02:43:38.140
proclaiming this that N-Gage is best selling system ever? No. What's that, though? I was

02:43:38.140 --> 02:43:41.940
gonna say tell me who they are so I can point and laugh at them appropriately, please. Thank

02:43:41.940 --> 02:43:48.940
p0k3smot42o you wanna play music? what music you wanna play?

02:44:11.940 --> 02:44:36.940
Um, let's see. Well, we've got, um, Healing Vision 2000, which is pretty good. Pretty good. I don't know if this is the actual name for it, because this guy, Dokurider or whatever, he does take a lot of songs, though, that are not his, and I've renamed them, but make sim files for him. I think he's foreign, so he doesn't know what the names of the songs are, so he just kind of makes one up.

02:44:36.940 --> 02:44:40.780
But anyways, you might be finding them on online, you know, file sharing sites.

02:44:40.780 --> 02:44:47.780
Um, but, anyways, we're gonna start off with Healing Vision 2000, and I'll try that one. So it's pretty cool.

02:46:40.780 --> 02:47:03.100
Anyways, that was pretty cool. Now, some other things I just, you know, listening to that

02:47:03.100 --> 02:47:08.580
reminded me. I forgot to mention the new stuff coming to you from the verse systems and there's

02:47:08.580 --> 02:47:15.180
a lot of stuff actually to mention. Four new albums were announced this week. Starting

02:47:15.180 --> 02:47:21.620
off with D8, which is the brand new Diversisms album, all Bomani remixes to the set. That

02:47:21.620 --> 02:47:26.180
should be coming out pretty soon. And we're actually going to play some of those samples

02:47:26.180 --> 02:47:30.220
from that, and they're pretty cool. I haven't listened to these new ones though that we're

02:47:30.220 --> 02:47:35.020
going to play, so it should be interesting. This first one is an Ecstasy remix called,

02:47:35.020 --> 02:47:43.020
Let's see here, what was the title? It was Ecstasy, Fly, Air, Heaven, is the name of that.

02:47:43.020 --> 02:47:46.380
So, um, you'll have to check this one out real quick here, let's see.

02:48:43.020 --> 02:48:53.020
Say it was a little sample of that. The other one I wanted to play real quick was a Gentle Stress remix called Gentle Sample.

02:48:53.020 --> 02:48:57.020
And that's going to be on disc 2 of that mix that's going to be coming out.

02:48:57.020 --> 02:49:01.020
Other ones that have been announced, we don't have any samples yet up before it.

02:49:01.020 --> 02:49:08.020
And I think this was just announced at the end of this week. A new one, Dear Mr. Taka, which should be pretty good.

02:49:08.020 --> 02:49:16.020
That's also gonna go with Dear Mr. 180 and Dear Mr. Desire. So it should be pretty good. All talking music, I would assume.

02:49:16.020 --> 02:49:23.020
A new one also they're gonna be working on, which is Diverse vs. Capcom, which should be pretty sweet.

02:49:23.020 --> 02:49:30.020
All remixes of your favorite, you know, side-scroller fighters.

02:49:30.020 --> 02:49:38.500
And then also, there's another, another title they announced, which is Fujitsu, which I

02:49:38.500 --> 02:49:46.300
believe is just actually just one of the artists. The guy did the remix of the Safari. You remember

02:49:46.300 --> 02:49:56.240
that one that's in Food Mix needed that. Oh God. Well we have to listen to this. We'll

02:49:56.240 --> 02:50:01.240
We'll listen to this next, but, uh, it's one of Rob's nightmares come alive.

02:50:01.240 --> 02:50:03.240
Jesus, what?

02:50:03.240 --> 02:50:05.240
Ahh!

02:50:05.240 --> 02:50:12.240
So anyways, um, the next one, like I said, uh, gentle stress, so we'll see what the example is.

02:50:35.240 --> 02:50:51.840
Okay, but the creme de la creme of the Fujitsu one, we teased about this last week, I believe,

02:50:51.840 --> 02:50:57.080
maybe even worse than that one Rob was mentioning. God, I hate those stupid sim files, you know,

02:50:57.080 --> 02:51:04.080
cross between songs, well this one, Max 321 Stars. Sadly enough, it was made.

02:51:27.080 --> 02:51:54.120
p0k3smot42o

02:51:54.120 --> 02:52:11.120
kostjamrh Anyway, some things just shouldn't be done. I don't care if it's by a really great Japanese remixing group, and I'm sure the guy's done some other really good files. But, uh, jeez. Alright, what's this?

02:52:11.120 --> 02:52:17.120
btw this is some other stuff, I don't really know what this is, Love is Eternity original extended mix

02:52:17.120 --> 02:52:22.120
uhh yeah, it is a course k album, they're also gonna be distributing the course k album looks like

02:52:22.120 --> 02:52:30.120
so uhm, yeah, lots of good stuff coming to you from diverse systems, unfortunately they have not updated their goddamn english page

02:52:30.120 --> 02:52:34.120
so we can't order any of this, unless you're in japan, that fucking sucks

02:52:34.120 --> 02:52:40.840
but that's the way life goes I guess. Still under construction English page but I'm hoping, hoping

02:52:40.840 --> 02:52:44.680
that once this does eventually you know once they update their English page

02:52:44.680 --> 02:52:46.360
we'll be able to order all this wonderful stuff.

02:52:49.240 --> 02:52:55.720
All right well I think that's about gonna wrap up tonight's show so um that's it you guys um thank

02:52:55.720 --> 02:53:00.200
you very much for tuning in tonight and uh we're gonna go around and get oh yeah Darchout do you

02:53:00.200 --> 02:53:04.860
you have another thought here? Once again, anyone who could offer me advice, email address

02:53:04.860 --> 02:53:13.700
dchild999 at yahoo.com. That's d-c-h-y-l-d-e-999 at yahoo.com. And if you forget that address,

02:53:13.700 --> 02:53:17.960
just go give a shout out on the forums and Darkchild will find you and take you under

02:53:17.960 --> 02:53:25.660
his wing and breastfeed you. No, I'm just kidding. All right, let's go around and get

02:53:25.660 --> 02:53:31.220
everybody's final thoughts of the day. Darktowd, your final thought?

02:53:31.220 --> 02:53:39.180
Die, Daniel, die. Loki, your final thought?

02:53:39.180 --> 02:53:46.660
I'm full and tired. And my final thought is, I don't care if it's

02:53:46.660 --> 02:53:52.820
a few minutes early, we're spent, so goodnight everybody. The final word of the show, one

02:53:52.820 --> 02:53:58.660
One word to sum it all up, we're going to give, as soon as I queue up the actual outro

02:53:58.660 --> 02:54:02.620
to the show, which would be a good idea, the final word to the show that will sum it all

02:54:02.620 --> 02:54:07.260
up, we're going to give it to the one, the only, Dark Child.

02:54:07.260 --> 02:54:11.820
So think of one word that's going to sum it all up for you, and the show.

02:54:11.820 --> 02:54:15.860
But also we do hope, Dark Sacker, if you're out there listening somewhere, although you

02:54:15.860 --> 02:54:19.100
might be asleep by now, I don't know, hope you feel better.

02:54:19.100 --> 02:54:20.100
Feel better soon.

02:54:20.100 --> 02:54:23.100
The show just isn't the same without you, trust me.

02:54:23.100 --> 02:54:42.480
And we'll see you guys next week. Hopefully Dark

02:54:42.480 --> 02:54:49.480

02:55:07.480 --> 02:55:14.480
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to St. Samia Street?

02:55:14.480 --> 02:55:18.480
How to get to St. Samia Street?

02:55:18.480 --> 02:55:22.480
How to get to St. Samia Street?

02:55:22.480 --> 02:55:28.480
Hello, Kermit the Frog here, and welcome to St. Samia Street.

02:55:28.480 --> 02:55:35.480
I'd like to tell you what today's letter is, but I am really f***ed up.

02:55:35.480 --> 02:55:39.480
Hey, Big Bird, do you know what today's letter is?

02:55:39.480 --> 02:55:43.480
Sure, Kermit. Today's letter is...

02:55:43.480 --> 02:55:47.480
joint.

02:55:47.480 --> 02:55:51.480
Uh, Big Bird, joint is not a letter.

02:55:51.480 --> 02:55:55.480
It is a word.

02:55:55.480 --> 02:55:59.480
Sorry, kids. Today's letter is three.

02:55:59.480 --> 02:56:03.480
Big Bird, uh, three

02:56:03.480 --> 02:56:11.080
he's a number exactly the number three which is how many joints i've smoked today

02:56:13.720 --> 02:56:16.200
Kermit are you with me

02:56:18.440 --> 02:56:21.320
thank god i'm stoned me too

02:56:21.320 --> 02:56:35.320
Thank you, Elmo. How about we say our ABCs, Big Bird?

02:56:35.320 --> 02:56:36.320
Okay.

02:56:36.320 --> 02:56:49.320
A, B, C, C, E, F, R, G, Q, K, C, R, E, F.

02:56:49.320 --> 02:56:54.320
I forgot what we were doing, Cramit.

02:56:54.320 --> 02:56:57.320
Did you just call me Cramit?

02:56:57.320 --> 02:56:59.320
Yes, I did.

02:56:59.320 --> 02:57:01.320
Cramit the Frog here.

02:57:05.320 --> 02:57:06.320
Okay, okay.

02:57:06.320 --> 02:57:09.320
That's all the time we have for today.

02:57:09.320 --> 02:57:10.320
Goodbye, kids.

02:57:10.320 --> 02:57:15.320
Today's show was brought to you by the letter, um...

02:57:15.320 --> 02:57:17.320
Bong.

02:57:17.320 --> 02:57:42.880
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

02:57:47.320 --> 02:58:17.280
Orange Lounge Radio Afterbirth is the part

02:58:17.280 --> 02:58:22.080
after the credits have faded to black and we're still here wanting attention from you

02:58:22.080 --> 02:58:28.120
guys. You know what? We literally only had not even half the usual listeners that we've

02:58:28.120 --> 02:58:33.300
had. I swear to God, we better start seeing an increase in people coming back to the station

02:58:33.300 --> 02:58:39.200
or we're quitting. It's quitting time. I'm just making empty threads. I don't know what

02:58:39.200 --> 02:58:43.200
we can do about it. I guess just because it's the holidays, but man, those were some, that

02:58:43.200 --> 02:58:46.200
That was a sad turnout tonight, you guys.

02:58:46.200 --> 02:58:51.200
Cry, cry, cry. I'm very upset with you all.

02:58:51.200 --> 02:58:57.200
Loki, any final post-credit things you wanted to get out?

02:58:57.200 --> 02:59:00.200
No. I'm tired.

02:59:00.200 --> 02:59:06.200
I just feel drained. All that food.

02:59:06.200 --> 02:59:08.200
9.30.

02:59:08.200 --> 02:59:12.200
That's three and a half hours of party time.

02:59:12.200 --> 02:59:13.200
That's what I thought.

02:59:13.200 --> 02:59:15.200
Addict.

02:59:15.200 --> 02:59:17.200
Although I'm thinking very similar thoughts here.

02:59:17.200 --> 02:59:22.200
But yeah, I've just eaten so much I just want to curl into the bed and take a big fat cat nap.

02:59:22.200 --> 02:59:24.200
Emphasis on fat.

02:59:24.200 --> 02:59:29.200
I got new flannel sheets for Christmas and they're comfy.

02:59:29.200 --> 02:59:33.200
They're very comfy.

02:59:33.200 --> 02:59:37.200
Your flight lights make me sleepy.

02:59:37.200 --> 02:59:46.200
Mine too. And, I don't know, all that's in it, okay, that's in my fried rice, is just, um, you know, rice, obviously, steamed rice.

02:59:46.200 --> 02:59:52.200
Um, egg, lots of garlic, lots of butter, lots of soy sauce, and pork.

02:59:54.200 --> 02:59:57.200
I don't know which one of those made me tired.

02:59:57.200 --> 03:00:00.200
That was pork? I don't eat pork.

03:00:00.200 --> 03:00:03.200
Oh well. Don't!

03:00:03.200 --> 03:00:08.200
At least I'm not Muslim, so I'm not going to hell.

03:00:08.200 --> 03:00:12.200
Oh well, it was tasty pork.

03:00:12.200 --> 03:00:16.200
So yeah, I don't know. I fucking hate my printer.

03:00:16.200 --> 03:00:23.200
I have to get new cartridges for it, and they're so tiny that they run out in like an hour, and they're like $20 each.

03:00:23.200 --> 03:00:29.200
I tried to print on your printer yesterday and it wouldn't work, so I just said fuck it, because I bought tickets on Fandango.

03:00:29.200 --> 03:00:33.540
For one you don't need to bring the ticket thing to it's not hooked up to my computer anymore

03:00:33.540 --> 03:00:40.320
I cuz I unplugged it for the extra long USB cable that was plugged in this god knows what else. I don't know something else and

03:00:42.460 --> 03:00:45.120
Anti-bank anyways, so you're screwed three times

03:00:47.780 --> 03:00:49.780
Well shit

03:00:51.220 --> 03:00:54.340
I need to play more DDR. I need to play anything in general

03:00:54.340 --> 03:01:00.500
general my friend and I beat San Andreas within three days with 40 hours and then

03:01:00.500 --> 03:01:04.980
we beat it 100% three days later

03:01:05.460 --> 03:01:13.980
I'm cheating the entire way it makes it so much you know so much better and have

03:01:13.980 --> 03:01:18.140
you ever been on a motorcycle I kid you not this happened to me twice I was on a

03:01:18.140 --> 03:01:22.740
motorcycle driving through the country and plane crashes into me oh yeah yeah

03:01:22.740 --> 03:01:29.740
Yeah, that happens all the time. We had walked out of one of our casinos in Vegas and a plane just flew right into the side of the building right next to the door.

03:01:29.740 --> 03:01:34.740
It's pretty cool. Now what you need to try is get into the two player mode and start at kiss.

03:01:34.740 --> 03:01:39.740
Have the first player kiss player two and player two then hit triangle to get in the vehicle.

03:01:39.740 --> 03:01:45.740
And then just watch what happens. There are a lot of messed up glitches in that game and that's one of the craziest.

03:01:45.740 --> 03:01:51.740
Or the one where you can actually cut the other person's head off and then they're just running headless throughout the whole game.

03:01:51.740 --> 03:01:58.420
or go ride the mountain bike off the top of the bike of the mount and with the

03:01:58.420 --> 03:02:02.780
parachutes get that out or you could just hold your brake and pedal with the

03:02:02.780 --> 03:02:07.700
mountain bike and suddenly you get sucked into the middle of the world

03:02:07.700 --> 03:02:13.180
I love games they're glitchy those are the best ones yeah the new one that I

03:02:13.180 --> 03:02:16.940
found out was when you could fly into the other world where all the rooms

03:02:16.940 --> 03:02:23.940
the

03:02:25.020 --> 03:02:28.020
and fly straight up

03:02:28.020 --> 03:02:32.020
market

03:02:32.020 --> 03:02:33.940
that should be in

03:02:33.940 --> 03:02:35.680
simply or that's not

03:02:35.680 --> 03:02:42.680
get the third set of tattoos and then you go to all the other interiors

03:02:42.680 --> 03:02:44.680
Alright, I think that's enough.

03:02:46.680 --> 03:02:49.680
I agree, I'm falling asleep over here, so have a great night everybody.

03:02:49.680 --> 03:02:52.680
Thank you very much to those of you guys who tuned in tonight.

03:02:52.680 --> 03:02:56.280
