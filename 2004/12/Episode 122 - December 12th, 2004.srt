00:07:18,512 --> 00:07:20,713
[SPEAKER_18]: I brought another minigame because I'm an addict.

46
00:07:21,178 --> 00:07:23,299
[SPEAKER_14]: Another mini-game, oh, the McDonald's mini-games.

47
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:25,459
[SPEAKER_18]: Did we ever end up talking about that last week?

48
00:07:25,539 --> 00:07:26,019
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, we did.

49
00:07:26,159 --> 00:07:26,640
[SPEAKER_14]: A little bit?

50
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,240
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, we did.

51
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,040
[SPEAKER_14]: So you can see where my attention is when it comes to this show.

52
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:30,981
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't remember anything.

53
00:07:31,021 --> 00:07:31,801
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know why I got it.

54
00:07:31,821 --> 00:07:33,021
[SPEAKER_18]: I was like, hey, they still have them.

55
00:07:33,141 --> 00:07:34,742
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, what the hell?

56
00:07:35,942 --> 00:07:42,984
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, so we'll be talking to everybody more a little bit later, and of course, updates on what's going on out there in the Bomani scene.

57
00:07:43,344 --> 00:07:46,105
[SPEAKER_14]: So definitely some interesting stuff going on for us here locally.

58
00:07:47,284 --> 00:07:51,787
[SPEAKER_14]: But as for those of you guys abroad and the rest of the nation and the world, things are boring for you.

59
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,248
[SPEAKER_14]: What can I say?

60
00:07:52,268 --> 00:07:52,748
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I'm kidding.

61
00:07:54,129 --> 00:07:54,990
[SPEAKER_14]: There are some things.

62
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:57,972
[SPEAKER_14]: There's some little things we'll have to talk about a little later on.

[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, we'll be back after this break of music featuring, you know, I'm thinking people seem to dig the Eurobeat pre-show we had going there, so I think we'll just keep the Eurobeat thing going.

69
00:08:29,563 --> 00:08:30,544
[SPEAKER_14]: How's that sound for you guys?

70
00:08:31,304 --> 00:08:32,085

71
00:08:32,285 --> 00:08:33,065
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, works for me.

72
00:08:33,866 --> 00:08:37,048
[SPEAKER_14]: We're gonna kick it off with a song that was in two different Bomani games.

73
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:39,129
[SPEAKER_14]: See if you can tell which ones.

74
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:42,672
[SPEAKER_14]: Right after... Actually, a lot of these songs showed up in multiple games.

75
00:08:43,612 --> 00:08:44,553
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll be right back after this.

76
00:10:25,106 --> 00:10:26,468
Thanks for watching!

77
00:12:19,813 --> 00:12:20,756
[SPEAKER_05]: You and me, M-I-C-K-Y

[SPEAKER_16]: Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio Because real radio makes Captain Jack cry

80
00:13:44,235 --> 00:13:47,576
[SPEAKER_14]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 122.

81
00:13:47,796 --> 00:13:49,017
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you guys for tuning in tonight.

82
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:51,498
[SPEAKER_14]: We do appreciate your support, as always.

83
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:54,299
[SPEAKER_14]: Some Eurobeat music in that break, just for you guys.

84
00:13:54,499 --> 00:13:56,279
[SPEAKER_14]: Because you guys seem to dig that during the pre-show.

85
00:13:56,319 --> 00:14:00,861
[SPEAKER_14]: At least those of you guys that spoke up in our chatroom, www.orangeloungeradio.com.

86
00:14:01,261 --> 00:14:07,803
[SPEAKER_14]: And if you didn't like that, well, you need to go back into chat and let us know so that the rest of the chatroom can yell at you appropriately.

87
00:14:07,823 --> 00:14:09,624
[SPEAKER_14]: Because that's what they'll do.

88
00:14:10,384 --> 00:14:12,325
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to be the first to say I didn't like that.

89
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:16,560
[SPEAKER_14]: If you thought that break was bad, wait till you see the next break.

90
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,220
[SPEAKER_14]: I already have the music queued up for the next break.

91
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,681
[SPEAKER_14]: Tonight, the goal is to drive you all crazy.

92
00:14:22,142 --> 00:14:26,543
[SPEAKER_14]: Because, you know, it is the holiday time, and this is the time of year when everybody goes, we'll be crazy.

93
00:14:27,323 --> 00:14:30,384
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, just thought we'd get some appropriate music to match that.

94
00:14:30,444 --> 00:14:31,004
[SPEAKER_14]: So, we'll see.

95
00:14:31,665 --> 00:14:33,305
[SPEAKER_14]: And at some point tonight, Silent Hill.

96
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:34,025
[SPEAKER_14]: I promise.

97
00:14:34,325 --> 00:14:37,847
[SPEAKER_14]: Because it is the season.

98
00:14:37,967 --> 00:14:38,487
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what we'll do?

99
00:14:38,527 --> 00:14:39,787
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll do like a Silent Hill break.

100
00:14:39,807 --> 00:14:42,308
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll play both remixes of Silent Hill, and then like your reign.

101
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:51,804
[SPEAKER_13]: You gotta play both versions of Silent Hill than that one song by Roman Holloway that was in Dancing the Stage.

102
00:14:52,405 --> 00:14:53,246
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a Christmas song too.

103
00:14:53,766 --> 00:14:54,427
[SPEAKER_13]: If I can find it.

104
00:14:54,507 --> 00:14:56,929
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to hear You're Not Here.

105
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I put that song on repeat four times in my car on the way here.

106
00:15:00,492 --> 00:15:02,514
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll definitely do You're Not Here a little later.

107
00:15:03,034 --> 00:15:05,677
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember when Parapara, or Parapara, however you like to say it.

108
00:15:05,717 --> 00:15:06,157
[SPEAKER_14]: Parapara.

109
00:15:06,177 --> 00:15:06,758
[SPEAKER_14]: Parapara.

110
00:15:06,838 --> 00:15:07,498
[SPEAKER_14]: Parapara.

111
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:09,060
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember when that used to be cool?

112
00:15:10,887 --> 00:15:14,091
[SPEAKER_14]: It seems like this subject comes up at least once a month on this show.

113
00:15:14,732 --> 00:15:16,976
[SPEAKER_14]: When Parabara was cool.

114
00:15:17,476 --> 00:15:21,943
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember when we all met at Miggle when they first got it and I only knew how to do half of the patapata.

115
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:24,627
[SPEAKER_02]: So I tried.

116
00:15:25,552 --> 00:15:28,834
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember tutorial mode in second mix, and I taught myself how to do it.

117
00:15:28,854 --> 00:15:31,475
[SPEAKER_14]: And I tried to learn the Mickey Mouse March, which we heard in that break there.

118
00:15:31,495 --> 00:15:32,936
[SPEAKER_18]: The Mickey Mouse March is freaking hard.

119
00:15:32,956 --> 00:15:34,317
[SPEAKER_14]: Freaking hard, oh my god.

120
00:15:34,377 --> 00:15:36,318
[SPEAKER_14]: And the DeltaDance.com is hard.

121
00:15:36,938 --> 00:15:38,459
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I'm, no, I never learned that one.

122
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,460
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you were watching when I tried to learn that one.

123
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:40,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

124
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,801
[SPEAKER_02]: In Stockton.

125
00:15:42,081 --> 00:15:50,185
[SPEAKER_14]: I, now, Loki sits here and bashes on Parapara, but I remember when he used to break out his white boy freestyle to some Parapara songs.

126
00:15:51,857 --> 00:15:54,618
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that was back in the day when I was doing knee drops on DDR.

127
00:15:54,658 --> 00:15:56,838
[SPEAKER_13]: I've come a long way since then.

128
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:59,479
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember how happy I was when I learned how to do Deluxe.

129
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:02,279
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd get to go out there and shake my ass.

130
00:16:02,659 --> 00:16:06,500
[SPEAKER_14]: I love doing Deluxe, but I... No, you were funny doing Like a Virgin.

131
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,521
[SPEAKER_14]: Like a Virgin was like the second par par I ever learned.

132
00:16:10,581 --> 00:16:13,962
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember living at the Bomani house.

133
00:16:14,062 --> 00:16:15,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone learned Boom Boom Fire first.

134
00:16:16,022 --> 00:16:17,762
[SPEAKER_14]: You remember the Bomani house years ago, right?

135
00:16:18,062 --> 00:16:19,723
[SPEAKER_14]: I should say Bomani Drama House.

136
00:16:20,143 --> 00:16:20,423
Bomani.

137
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,361
[SPEAKER_02]: To say the least.

138
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:26,262
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, different times.

139
00:16:26,342 --> 00:16:27,063
[SPEAKER_14]: What can you say?

140
00:16:27,103 --> 00:16:33,526
[SPEAKER_14]: But I remember when the house got para para, and that was like the first one I made myself sit down and learn.

141
00:16:33,566 --> 00:16:37,468
[SPEAKER_14]: I had already learned Boom Boom Fire, but I was like, it's got a Madonna connection.

142
00:16:38,108 --> 00:16:39,649
[SPEAKER_14]: As a gay man, I have to learn this dance.

143
00:16:40,669 --> 00:16:41,650
[SPEAKER_14]: And it wasn't really.

144
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:43,691
[SPEAKER_14]: It's actually kind of challenging.

145
00:16:43,751 --> 00:16:45,572
[SPEAKER_14]: I still barely remember it to this day.

146
00:16:45,932 --> 00:16:46,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I...

147
00:16:48,743 --> 00:16:53,865
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that my first one that I learned was actually Eurobeat, which is like really easy.

148
00:16:54,586 --> 00:17:00,489
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I learned, I tried to learn Speedway, but Boom and Fire was like my third one.

149
00:17:01,289 --> 00:17:08,492
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when we had the five song chorus, I learned how to do, Night of Fire was my second one, that was it.

150
00:17:08,552 --> 00:17:09,793
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember Sexy, Sexy, Sexy?

151
00:17:10,493 --> 00:17:10,734
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

152
00:17:10,754 --> 00:17:11,154
[SPEAKER_14]: That was awesome.

153
00:17:11,634 --> 00:17:17,997
[SPEAKER_02]: But I wanted to learn, when we were still playing, I wanted to learn O Sole Mio, and I never did, just because the little walk where you stay on your ass.

154
00:17:20,029 --> 00:17:21,050
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm talking about!

155
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:23,891
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh sole mio, I just farted!

156
00:17:25,352 --> 00:17:32,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you do your hand to one side, and then you do your other hand back, like the I'm the Little Teacup dance, except you're fanning your ass as you move forward.

157
00:17:33,638 --> 00:17:37,480
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, my ass is on fire, put me out!

158
00:17:39,761 --> 00:17:42,583
[SPEAKER_14]: Most people who play Parapar probably have an ass on fire.

159
00:17:44,424 --> 00:17:45,345
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a good one.

160
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:46,786
[SPEAKER_14]: You're welcome, any time.

161
00:17:47,412 --> 00:17:50,095
[SPEAKER_14]: It's little observations like that that make this show worth it, you know?

162
00:17:50,275 --> 00:17:51,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you're so not PC.

163
00:17:51,876 --> 00:17:55,960
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember, that was really the first time we ever hung out, I think, that I met you, was that trip.

164
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:12,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and then we went on to Ziggle, and Enrique was with us, and we both got our crappy Freestyle on 4th mix, and somehow or another, we ended up doing a complete mirror of each other.

165
00:18:13,746 --> 00:18:18,208
[SPEAKER_02]: and decided we were going to be all rad and did knee drops on the last thing, but it was like the two knee one.

166
00:18:18,828 --> 00:18:23,230
[SPEAKER_02]: It was to, uh, shoot, what was the song that everybody hated from Third Mix?

167
00:18:23,691 --> 00:18:25,491
[SPEAKER_14]: Was that the guy that always did the Buell dance?

168
00:18:25,651 --> 00:18:26,892
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I always did Buell.

169
00:18:27,032 --> 00:18:27,372
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

170
00:18:27,932 --> 00:18:30,354
[SPEAKER_14]: The, the, uh, boy band song?

171
00:18:30,374 --> 00:18:30,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

172
00:18:30,514 --> 00:18:35,716
[SPEAKER_02]: We always do the boy band style dancing, but we ended it, like, back to back at the same time.

173
00:18:35,756 --> 00:18:36,276
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty cool.

174
00:18:36,436 --> 00:18:37,417
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, oh my god.

175
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:39,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever happened to that guy?

176
00:18:39,858 --> 00:18:40,758
[SPEAKER_02]: I went into him.

177
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:41,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

178
00:18:41,999 --> 00:18:43,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Like six months ago or something.

179
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,721
[SPEAKER_02]: But he's like, hi, hi, okay, bye.

180
00:18:45,801 --> 00:18:49,363
[SPEAKER_14]: I love talking about people that our national listenership has no idea who they are.

181
00:18:49,423 --> 00:18:52,445
[SPEAKER_13]: But you know, who did that thing?

182
00:18:52,885 --> 00:18:53,505
[SPEAKER_13]: He was cool.

183
00:18:54,486 --> 00:18:57,567
[SPEAKER_14]: You remember that guy at that one place here locally that did that thing?

184
00:18:57,627 --> 00:18:58,268
[SPEAKER_14]: He was awesome.

185
00:18:59,068 --> 00:19:01,389
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, we're getting a little off track.

186
00:19:01,429 --> 00:19:04,371
[SPEAKER_14]: We have to start off the show as we start off every night's programs.

187
00:19:04,983 --> 00:19:09,445
[SPEAKER_14]: with a little bit of How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day, where we find out how your week was and how your day was.

188
00:19:09,845 --> 00:19:11,947
[SPEAKER_14]: And maybe you played some Bomani this week, maybe you didn't.

189
00:19:12,007 --> 00:19:12,707
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll find out.

190
00:19:12,927 --> 00:19:14,028
[SPEAKER_14]: Jamie, start us off.

191
00:19:15,268 --> 00:19:16,249
[SPEAKER_13]: No big whoop.

192
00:19:16,309 --> 00:19:16,849
[SPEAKER_13]: No big whoop.

193
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:21,131
[SPEAKER_13]: I would like to proceed this How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day to give Jamie her gift.

194
00:19:21,651 --> 00:19:21,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

195
00:19:22,592 --> 00:19:22,772
Oh.

196
00:19:23,392 --> 00:19:23,832
[SPEAKER_14]: Presents.

197
00:19:23,852 --> 00:19:24,613
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a gift.

198
00:19:24,953 --> 00:19:25,333
[SPEAKER_14]: Presents.

199
00:19:25,433 --> 00:19:26,714
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I've got a gift.

200
00:19:28,737 --> 00:19:30,379
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm poor, so I haven't bought gifts yet, so forgive me.

201
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,041
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a cute little gothy doll!

202
00:19:47,448 --> 00:19:48,569
[SPEAKER_02]: It's evil and cute.

203
00:19:48,609 --> 00:19:49,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, I love it.

204
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:52,332
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's got like religious symbols on her that want to kill people.

205
00:19:52,352 --> 00:19:53,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we put her on the cam?

206
00:19:53,433 --> 00:19:55,114
[SPEAKER_14]: I can use it to open a portal to hell.

207
00:19:55,334 --> 00:19:55,895
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, hello.

208
00:19:55,935 --> 00:19:57,256
[SPEAKER_14]: You're off the Richter scale.

209
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:59,197
[SPEAKER_14]: For once, Jamie is too loud tonight.

210
00:19:59,218 --> 00:20:00,238
[SPEAKER_02]: And she has an apple.

211
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:02,900
[SPEAKER_14]: Jamie's doing the Jonas thing there a little bit.

212
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Put her on the cam.

213
00:20:03,741 --> 00:20:03,901
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

214
00:20:03,921 --> 00:20:04,782
[SPEAKER_02]: She's cute.

215
00:20:04,982 --> 00:20:06,123
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to be on the cam though.

216
00:20:06,803 --> 00:20:09,005
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, we'll get the doll on the cam, the evil doll.

217
00:20:09,506 --> 00:20:11,307
[SPEAKER_14]: And can you get my present up there too?

218
00:20:12,188 --> 00:20:13,649
[SPEAKER_14]: For those folks looking at the cam.

219
00:20:14,329 --> 00:20:15,310
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not going to tell you what it is.

220
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:16,251
[SPEAKER_14]: You have to go look at the cam.

221
00:20:17,468 --> 00:20:18,109
[SPEAKER_14]: It's right, it's right.

222
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:20,552
[SPEAKER_14]: Angel, what's that DVD on the table there?

223
00:20:20,712 --> 00:20:21,613
[SPEAKER_14]: Oop, I already gave it him.

224
00:20:22,113 --> 00:20:22,594
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, there you go.

225
00:20:22,614 --> 00:20:25,897
[SPEAKER_14]: You can go put that on the cam as well.

226
00:20:26,618 --> 00:20:30,202
[SPEAKER_02]: I have cute Dolly, and she's evil.

227
00:20:30,943 --> 00:20:31,503
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, anyway.

228
00:20:32,524 --> 00:20:33,946
[SPEAKER_14]: So, DarkSakura, moving on.

229
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:34,767
[SPEAKER_14]: How was your week, how was your day?

230
00:20:36,004 --> 00:20:40,706
[SPEAKER_02]: My week was cool, except I've been poor all week because I get paid like Wednesday.

231
00:20:41,926 --> 00:20:47,367
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have to wait until after payday to buy presents for people.

232
00:20:47,587 --> 00:20:48,788
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just a procrastinator.

233
00:20:48,828 --> 00:20:50,568
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not going to be buying any presents until Christmas Eve.

234
00:20:51,068 --> 00:20:54,249
[SPEAKER_02]: My whole week was nothing but school and working my ass off at the gym.

235
00:20:54,329 --> 00:20:55,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I love my doll so much.

236
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:58,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, these are so cool.

237
00:20:58,571 --> 00:21:00,231
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have apples with needles in them.

238
00:21:02,112 --> 00:21:03,452
[SPEAKER_14]: The perfect Halloween treat.

239
00:21:05,461 --> 00:21:06,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god!

240
00:21:06,862 --> 00:21:07,742
[SPEAKER_02]: I love this outfit.

241
00:21:07,802 --> 00:21:08,563
[SPEAKER_02]: I would wear this.

242
00:21:09,223 --> 00:21:09,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.

243
00:21:10,024 --> 00:21:11,044
[SPEAKER_14]: This is great radio.

244
00:21:11,865 --> 00:21:12,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

245
00:21:12,725 --> 00:21:15,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Um... But, um... I, uh...

246
00:21:16,829 --> 00:21:30,672
[SPEAKER_02]: I really, all I did was go to the gym, and yesterday though, yesterday I hung out with, well I hung out with Anita twice at the gym, DD Alcoholic, and then I did a lot of spin, a lot of working out, I was really sore for a while.

247
00:21:31,053 --> 00:21:36,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Yesterday I hung out with Iguana Girl, and Islander, and Tia.

248
00:21:37,814 --> 00:21:39,575
[SPEAKER_14]: Who doesn't have an online name, she's just Tia.

249
00:21:39,595 --> 00:21:40,295
[SPEAKER_02]: She's just Tia.

250
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:41,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Be great and terrible.

251
00:21:42,276 --> 00:21:42,896
[SPEAKER_02]: But awesome.

252
00:21:43,656 --> 00:21:44,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.

253
00:21:44,917 --> 00:21:48,658
[SPEAKER_02]: And we played Mario Party 6, which is pretty groovy.

254
00:21:49,238 --> 00:21:49,618
[SPEAKER_02]: I won.

255
00:21:49,938 --> 00:21:50,899
[SPEAKER_02]: I won so cool.

256
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:52,399
[SPEAKER_14]: I always win Mario Party.

257
00:21:52,419 --> 00:21:53,880
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I've been beaten one time.

258
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:59,062
[SPEAKER_14]: The reign of Princess Peach Terror comes into play.

259
00:21:59,082 --> 00:21:59,662
[SPEAKER_02]: I was Boo.

260
00:22:00,662 --> 00:22:01,963
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what we got?

261
00:22:02,563 --> 00:22:05,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Me and Tia won a game, one of the little mini games, and we got Daisy Boo.

262
00:22:07,285 --> 00:22:09,407
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, Princess Peach is still a playable character, right?

263
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:12,011
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank God, because I always play Princess Peach.

264
00:22:12,091 --> 00:22:13,533
[SPEAKER_14]: I throw a fit if I can't be Peach.

265
00:22:14,294 --> 00:22:15,595
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to be the pretty princess.

266
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:22,144
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I love when she does that Peach is the winner thing.

267
00:22:22,344 --> 00:22:23,065
[SPEAKER_14]: She flips her hair.

268
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:28,463
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to move the chat room over the webcam again.

269
00:22:28,483 --> 00:22:36,588
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, we were trying to decide what to eat, so we kept talking about fish tacos.

270
00:22:39,009 --> 00:22:44,192
[SPEAKER_02]: And we couldn't get off of the subject about eating fish tacos.

271
00:22:45,353 --> 00:22:50,456
[SPEAKER_14]: How exactly do a bunch of women and Islander hanging out together prepare fish tacos?

272
00:22:52,364 --> 00:22:53,225
[SPEAKER_02]: It just came up.

273
00:22:56,168 --> 00:22:59,812
[SPEAKER_02]: A bunch of women hanging out preparing fish tacos.

274
00:23:00,913 --> 00:23:01,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

275
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:07,479
[SPEAKER_02]: It made me think about that time we went to the Elephant Bar and I ordered fish tacos and you laughed about it.

276
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:08,620
[SPEAKER_14]: I did.

277
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,982
[SPEAKER_14]: I giggled for like a half hour straight.

278
00:23:10,262 --> 00:23:11,143
[SPEAKER_14]: I am so immature.

279
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:11,924
[SPEAKER_14]: But you know what?

280
00:23:12,084 --> 00:23:15,047
[SPEAKER_14]: I know our listeners are immature too because I'm looking at the chat room right now.

281
00:23:16,521 --> 00:23:18,942
[SPEAKER_14]: Everybody is making ass jokes.

282
00:23:19,682 --> 00:23:22,424
[SPEAKER_14]: Just they're saying DDR songs and they're putting ass in the title.

283
00:23:22,444 --> 00:23:23,485
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll tell the ass?

284
00:23:23,605 --> 00:23:34,572
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, Love is Ass, Paranoia Survivor Ass, I like this, Cartoon Asses, Tittle Assle, Blow My Ass Bitch.

285
00:23:35,212 --> 00:23:36,253
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a good one.

286
00:23:36,273 --> 00:23:37,273
[SPEAKER_14]: This is funny apparently.

287
00:23:37,293 --> 00:23:38,154
[SPEAKER_02]: How about Burning Ass?

288
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:40,675
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway.

289
00:23:41,596 --> 00:23:42,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

290
00:23:42,096 --> 00:23:42,897
[SPEAKER_14]: Scorching Ass.

291
00:23:44,344 --> 00:23:47,106
[SPEAKER_02]: I was referring to Burning Heat, but Burning Heat can also refer to ass, too.

292
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:47,446
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you mean?

293
00:23:47,466 --> 00:23:47,986
[SPEAKER_02]: Scorching Moon?

294
00:23:48,246 --> 00:23:49,747
[SPEAKER_02]: If one doesn't bathe or something.

295
00:23:50,228 --> 00:23:50,488
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway.

296
00:23:51,028 --> 00:23:51,989
[SPEAKER_14]: Flash in the ass.

297
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:55,271
[SPEAKER_02]: My week, my day.

298
00:23:55,291 --> 00:23:55,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

299
00:23:55,491 --> 00:23:56,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, sorry.

300
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:57,392
[SPEAKER_02]: I have things to do.

301
00:23:57,412 --> 00:23:58,512
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, I was just preoccupied.

302
00:23:58,552 --> 00:23:59,353
[SPEAKER_14]: Drifting asses.

303
00:23:59,573 --> 00:23:59,773
[SPEAKER_14]: Ass.

304
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:00,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob.

305
00:24:00,974 --> 00:24:01,174
[SPEAKER_14]: What?

306
00:24:02,074 --> 00:24:03,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you like to ass?

307
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:05,597
Ass.

308
00:24:07,539 --> 00:24:08,980
[SPEAKER_14]: There's something in the air tonight.

309
00:24:09,361 --> 00:24:11,902
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a little too much eggnog going around for everybody.

310
00:24:11,962 --> 00:24:12,142
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, ass.

311
00:24:12,323 --> 00:24:12,803
[SPEAKER_14]: I think.

312
00:24:14,124 --> 00:24:14,444
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway.

313
00:24:14,784 --> 00:24:15,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I had alcohol.

314
00:24:15,845 --> 00:24:16,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Even a little bit.

315
00:24:16,586 --> 00:24:20,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Even when you cook all the alcohol out, I still react to it like giggly.

316
00:24:20,889 --> 00:24:23,891
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to... I cooked tonight, too.

317
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:24,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

318
00:24:24,531 --> 00:24:25,212
[SPEAKER_02]: Back to last night.

319
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:27,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Preparation.

320
00:24:29,261 --> 00:24:30,422
[SPEAKER_14]: Stop reading the chat room.

321
00:24:30,442 --> 00:24:31,702
[SPEAKER_14]: They're too immature tonight.

322
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:33,443
[SPEAKER_14]: They don't deserve to be looked at.

323
00:24:33,843 --> 00:24:39,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we just could not decide on what to eat, so finally Ross is all, we're just going to go to a hometown buffet.

324
00:24:40,406 --> 00:24:40,626
Ew!

325
00:24:42,207 --> 00:24:42,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Ew!

326
00:24:42,907 --> 00:24:49,030
[SPEAKER_02]: So we went to like the... I've been to a couple of different hometown buffets and they were all kind of okay, you know.

327
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:51,671
[SPEAKER_02]: We went to the one on the ass end of White Avenue.

328
00:24:53,172 --> 00:24:54,812
[SPEAKER_02]: And I literally do mean the ass end.

329
00:24:54,872 --> 00:24:56,273
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like up there by Walmart.

330
00:24:57,199 --> 00:25:07,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, to anybody who's not in this area, has no idea what you're talking about It's like the ghetto side of it If anyone has ever been in Sacramento, if you're going up past where McClellan was

331
00:25:08,826 --> 00:25:09,666
[SPEAKER_02]: It's up in the ass.

332
00:25:09,706 --> 00:25:12,027
[SPEAKER_14]: So basically you went to a hometown buffet in the ghetto.

333
00:25:12,287 --> 00:25:12,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

334
00:25:12,767 --> 00:25:13,147
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

335
00:25:13,947 --> 00:25:17,688
[SPEAKER_02]: And there were the people there saying, after this we're going to go get some entertainment over at Walmart.

336
00:25:18,748 --> 00:25:19,248
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, whatever.

337
00:25:20,648 --> 00:25:22,529
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, I ate a bunch of food.

338
00:25:22,849 --> 00:25:23,349
[SPEAKER_02]: It was yummy.

339
00:25:24,809 --> 00:25:26,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Of the temple of butt.

340
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:27,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no, I'm sorry.

341
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:27,950
[SPEAKER_14]: Stop reading chat.

342
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:28,510
[SPEAKER_14]: Stop.

343
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:29,250
[SPEAKER_14]: I command you.

344
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:30,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Bite me.

345
00:25:30,611 --> 00:25:32,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Mmm, potato.

346
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:34,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Get on Ass Cloud Style

347
00:25:56,496 --> 00:26:00,038
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, weekday, hometown buffet.

348
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:07,702
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so we came back, watched Rejected, and Hedvig, I am a banana.

349
00:26:07,722 --> 00:26:12,204
[SPEAKER_14]: What?

350
00:26:12,684 --> 00:26:18,147
[SPEAKER_14]: My Rejected DVD was part of the settlement in my last relationship.

351
00:26:18,367 --> 00:26:18,447
Oh.

352
00:26:19,275 --> 00:26:26,117
[SPEAKER_14]: I made out with a third style, fourth style, and a DDR pad, and he made out with a rejected DVD, so it was a fair trade.

353
00:26:27,617 --> 00:26:31,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we watched Rejected, and then we watched Hedwig and the Angry Inch.

354
00:26:32,538 --> 00:26:33,158
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that movie.

355
00:26:33,738 --> 00:26:34,559
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I went home.

356
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:37,099
[SPEAKER_02]: And then today, I sat on my ass and did nothing.

357
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:42,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, okay, I went to the grocery store to buy cream, and Dan's like, buy me some ice cream.

358
00:26:43,421 --> 00:26:43,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

359
00:26:45,387 --> 00:26:49,929
[SPEAKER_02]: She sat around watching Return of the King, which I don't want to watch because I think Gollum is retarded.

360
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:52,891
[SPEAKER_14]: There is something weird about that guy.

361
00:26:53,291 --> 00:26:56,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, of course he's meant to be creepy, but he actually turns my stomach.

362
00:26:57,853 --> 00:27:01,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I did manage to peek down for some of the Legolas scenes, so that was cool.

363
00:27:01,415 --> 00:27:02,696
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, ooh, elf man.

364
00:27:03,856 --> 00:27:10,199
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I came up here early before the show, about the time pre-show started, and I cooked.

365
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:11,800
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, you did.

366
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:18,029
[SPEAKER_02]: I made these kebabs with shrimp and scallops topped with lobster tail.

367
00:27:25,023 --> 00:27:29,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Green beans cooked in butter and herbs with cream sauce to coat.

368
00:27:29,644 --> 00:27:34,486
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm actually putting the recipe for the cream sauce in my live journal for anyone who goes to live journal.

369
00:27:34,526 --> 00:27:35,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Only my friends can see it.

370
00:27:36,046 --> 00:27:36,926
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're the lucky few.

371
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:39,987
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, you could always put it in the Orange Lounge community because the Orange Lounge community needs something.

372
00:27:40,007 --> 00:27:40,807
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like them.

373
00:27:41,207 --> 00:27:41,708
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

374
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:42,248
[SPEAKER_02]: Kidding.

375
00:27:44,349 --> 00:27:45,929
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll let someone else repost it for me.

376
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:52,993
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically I made this amaretto cream sauce to go over it.

377
00:27:53,113 --> 00:28:04,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Normally when I make green beans I go for the Italian style spicy or I'll do it up Cajun style.

378
00:28:04,239 --> 00:28:05,760
[SPEAKER_02]: I went for sweet cream this time.

379
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,521
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had garlic in it.

380
00:28:07,987 --> 00:28:09,950
[SPEAKER_14]: Jamie let me eat her sweet cream.

381
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:11,091
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was good.

382
00:28:12,013 --> 00:28:18,261
[SPEAKER_02]: But I had garlic in it and some pepper and amaretto and butter and cream.

383
00:28:19,743 --> 00:28:21,686
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a lot of ingredients in Jamie's sweet cream.

384
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:23,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, whatever.

385
00:28:24,631 --> 00:28:29,493
[SPEAKER_02]: But I am like, I just pulled this recipe right out of my ass and it tended to be really good.

386
00:28:29,973 --> 00:28:30,853
[SPEAKER_14]: I keep saying ass.

387
00:28:30,893 --> 00:28:33,314
[SPEAKER_14]: What is with the ass fixation with you people tonight?

388
00:28:33,494 --> 00:28:34,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Is everybody gay?

389
00:28:35,234 --> 00:28:37,255
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my normal phrasing, okay?

390
00:28:37,675 --> 00:28:39,476
[SPEAKER_02]: And the chat room is imitating me.

391
00:28:39,936 --> 00:28:41,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Pay me some rent, bitches.

392
00:28:42,457 --> 00:28:43,197
[SPEAKER_02]: I love you guys.

393
00:28:43,897 --> 00:28:44,178
[SPEAKER_02]: A little.

394
00:28:46,778 --> 00:28:47,079
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm done.

395
00:28:47,499 --> 00:28:47,919
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, you're done?

396
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:49,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm done.

397
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:51,112
[SPEAKER_14]: Wait, but whatever happened?

398
00:28:51,232 --> 00:28:52,954
[SPEAKER_14]: There were no fun stories about Hometown Buffet?

399
00:28:52,994 --> 00:28:53,835
[SPEAKER_14]: You kind of glossed right over it.

400
00:28:53,855 --> 00:28:54,976
[SPEAKER_02]: None of the people scared me there.

401
00:28:55,016 --> 00:28:58,679
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy in painter overalls with the beer belly.

402
00:28:59,139 --> 00:29:01,101
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I heard that there were... He's pregnant.

403
00:29:01,261 --> 00:29:06,546
[SPEAKER_14]: I heard that there are people out there that will go to Hometown Buffet in the morning and then stay there all day long.

404
00:29:07,062 --> 00:29:11,965
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they have a policy where they kick them out because they have to change the dinners and everything in between.

405
00:29:12,005 --> 00:29:13,226
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that's the smart thing to do.

406
00:29:14,227 --> 00:29:15,628
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you imagine that?

407
00:29:15,788 --> 00:29:19,791
[SPEAKER_02]: One of these nights where we have to go to the buffet over at Thunder Valley.

408
00:29:21,172 --> 00:29:22,193
[SPEAKER_14]: That is a good buffet.

409
00:29:22,553 --> 00:29:23,013
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

410
00:29:23,093 --> 00:29:26,856
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a little slice of Vegas right here in our backyard.

411
00:29:26,876 --> 00:29:30,558
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to do that the night before New Year's Eve.

412
00:29:31,859 --> 00:29:32,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Do like the Orange Lounge.

413
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,101
[SPEAKER_02]: We can bring the tape recorder.

414
00:29:34,401 --> 00:29:35,181
[SPEAKER_14]: We could do something like that.

415
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:36,062
[SPEAKER_02]: We should do that.

416
00:29:36,242 --> 00:29:37,002
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I'm down with that.

417
00:29:37,022 --> 00:29:39,723
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like pre-New Year's Eve, eat a whole bunch of sugar-a-thon.

418
00:29:39,863 --> 00:29:40,784
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, sounds good.

419
00:29:41,004 --> 00:29:41,464
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, I'm done.

420
00:29:41,624 --> 00:29:42,625
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, uh, Loki!

421
00:29:44,445 --> 00:29:46,026
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, Loki's eating, so we're gonna go to Angel.

422
00:29:46,106 --> 00:29:46,726
[SPEAKER_14]: Angel, how was your week?

423
00:29:46,746 --> 00:29:47,106
[SPEAKER_14]: How was your day?

424
00:29:48,127 --> 00:29:53,729
[SPEAKER_18]: Played a little bit of Imani this week, uh, 7th style, just cause I haven't bought 8th style yet.

425
00:29:54,429 --> 00:30:00,312
[SPEAKER_18]: But, uh, I kinda gave up after, like, a couple songs, cause my controller's being a pain in the butt.

426
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:05,193
[SPEAKER_18]: Honestly, like, it's just sticking and being a pain.

427
00:30:05,253 --> 00:30:09,657
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's going to turn out like Rob's controller if I don't be careful, so I need to do something about that.

428
00:30:10,537 --> 00:30:19,325
[SPEAKER_18]: And also, I found a new Korean game addiction that I should probably talk about later, because I don't know if you guys are going to say it's going to suck or not.

429
00:30:20,406 --> 00:30:20,786
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey!

430
00:30:22,347 --> 00:30:28,833
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, the only thing I'm going to give away for now is that it's a mix between, like,

431
00:30:29,938 --> 00:30:58,389
[SPEAKER_14]: Ragnarok meets Final Fantasy meets Commander Keen and I'll tell you right now I ain't leaving Final Fantasy for it because you don't want to know how many people have told me this week Rob, join World of Warcraft no, Rob, join World of Warcraft no, I've worked too hard on Final Fantasy XI I'm probably going to be playing World of Warcraft fuck you, seriously if I have time love you Dan's probably going to be playing World of Warcraft I miss your Mithra I miss her you want to play for my account?

432
00:30:58,410 --> 00:30:59,350
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll play again hell no

433
00:31:02,671 --> 00:31:03,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't miss her that much.

434
00:31:03,992 --> 00:31:05,533
[SPEAKER_02]: She's only level, what, seven?

435
00:31:06,594 --> 00:31:07,794
[SPEAKER_02]: And I played for three months?

436
00:31:07,974 --> 00:31:08,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Four months?

437
00:31:09,916 --> 00:31:10,736
[SPEAKER_02]: You know I'm teasing.

438
00:31:13,318 --> 00:31:15,079
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, anyway, off track.

439
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,320
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, yeah.

440
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,901
[SPEAKER_18]: And then I got finals this week, but that's beside the point.

441
00:31:19,302 --> 00:31:20,262
[SPEAKER_18]: Other than that, no school.

442
00:31:20,422 --> 00:31:20,883
[SPEAKER_18]: Yay!

443
00:31:22,544 --> 00:31:22,844
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

444
00:31:23,825 --> 00:31:24,645
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, ready to talk?

445
00:31:25,766 --> 00:31:28,288
[SPEAKER_14]: You got enough potato down where you can talk here?

446
00:31:28,508 --> 00:31:30,129
[SPEAKER_14]: Starchy, how was your week?

447
00:31:30,149 --> 00:31:30,529
[SPEAKER_14]: How was your day?

448
00:31:31,618 --> 00:31:35,541
[SPEAKER_13]: This is my really starchy, really full of sodium meal.

449
00:31:36,822 --> 00:31:38,563
[SPEAKER_13]: That's really good for me, I'm sure.

450
00:31:39,424 --> 00:31:41,786
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways, how'd this week go?

451
00:31:42,006 --> 00:31:43,867
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh yeah, first went to a funeral.

452
00:31:44,888 --> 00:31:45,368
[SPEAKER_13]: That was fun.

453
00:31:45,889 --> 00:31:48,351
[SPEAKER_13]: Got to see lots of family, but there was ham, so that was good.

454
00:31:50,512 --> 00:31:58,198
[SPEAKER_14]: And then... You talking about ham makes me think of this thing that was in the Christmas present that you got me.

455
00:31:59,139 --> 00:32:00,180
[SPEAKER_14]: Did I tell you about this?

456
00:32:01,632 --> 00:32:02,493
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll talk about it later.

457
00:32:02,853 --> 00:32:03,814
[SPEAKER_14]: After the kids go to bed.

458
00:32:03,874 --> 00:32:04,654
[SPEAKER_14]: Later in the show.

459
00:32:06,756 --> 00:32:07,096
[SPEAKER_13]: God.

460
00:32:07,276 --> 00:32:07,676
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways.

461
00:32:09,557 --> 00:32:14,100
[SPEAKER_13]: So then, after that, Wednesday, I didn't do anything.

462
00:32:15,561 --> 00:32:19,284
[SPEAKER_13]: Thursday, I took the day off to take my car down to get the brakes fixed.

463
00:32:19,744 --> 00:32:22,566
[SPEAKER_13]: That was wonderful because it's done now.

464
00:32:23,767 --> 00:32:24,967
[SPEAKER_13]: Play lots of Final Fantasy.

465
00:32:24,987 --> 00:32:28,650
[SPEAKER_13]: I was going to work on the cabinet.

466
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:30,531
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually did work on the cabinet.

467
00:32:31,288 --> 00:32:41,476
[SPEAKER_13]: and my DDR pads create too much static electricity and it ends up temporarily shorting out the IPEC every time I use them.

468
00:32:42,918 --> 00:32:46,420
[SPEAKER_13]: So I gotta modify them again, slightly, hopefully.

469
00:32:47,381 --> 00:32:48,422
[SPEAKER_13]: And hopefully that'll fix it.

470
00:32:49,483 --> 00:32:51,705
[SPEAKER_13]: If not, I gotta chuck them.

471
00:32:52,245 --> 00:32:53,006
[SPEAKER_13]: That makes me sad.

472
00:32:54,026 --> 00:32:54,447
[SPEAKER_13]: But, um...

473
00:32:55,683 --> 00:33:06,167
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, so I worked on that and lots of Final Fantasy and I had to make cookies for tomorrow at work because our boss volunteered us.

474
00:33:07,267 --> 00:33:09,288
[SPEAKER_14]: You had to make cookies or your mom had to make cookies?

475
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:11,128
[SPEAKER_13]: I had to make cookies.

476
00:33:12,029 --> 00:33:12,609
[SPEAKER_18]: Impressive.

477
00:33:13,369 --> 00:33:14,529
[SPEAKER_13]: Shit, it's just cookies.

478
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:15,730
[SPEAKER_18]: Did you toss them?

479
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:18,611
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I did not toss the cookies.

480
00:33:20,471 --> 00:33:22,272
[SPEAKER_13]: So yeah, he volunteered us to do this.

481
00:33:23,447 --> 00:33:24,528
[SPEAKER_13]: and none of us wanted to do it.

482
00:33:24,829 --> 00:33:29,232
[SPEAKER_13]: And then he's like, yeah, we'll do it as a team, but I'm not going to do it.

483
00:33:30,794 --> 00:33:33,676
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, I ended up having to make cookies and they looked like nipples.

484
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:41,022
[SPEAKER_13]: And I also sold some other cookies for my mom's house.

485
00:33:41,963 --> 00:33:44,385
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's some that look like croissants that are pretty good.

486
00:33:44,405 --> 00:33:45,886
[SPEAKER_13]: Those are good.

487
00:33:46,226 --> 00:33:49,709
[SPEAKER_13]: And I ate all the butter cookies that she had, she gave me.

488
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:51,911
[SPEAKER_13]: So, oh, so good.

489
00:33:54,204 --> 00:33:56,385
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, and I saw Blade Trinity yesterday, and that was good.

490
00:33:58,566 --> 00:34:01,807
[SPEAKER_13]: I just didn't really care anymore, but Ryan Reynolds made it funny.

491
00:34:01,828 --> 00:34:05,309
[SPEAKER_13]: Because Wesley Snipes, just eh.

492
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,931
[SPEAKER_13]: But Ryan Reynolds being a jackass, that was good.

493
00:34:10,232 --> 00:34:10,512
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all.

494
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,251
[SPEAKER_14]: Ryan Reynolds is Alanis Morissette's fiancee.

495
00:34:14,551 --> 00:34:14,971
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you know that?

496
00:34:15,732 --> 00:34:15,972
[SPEAKER_14]: I did.

497
00:34:16,092 --> 00:34:16,612
[SPEAKER_14]: How sad is that?

498
00:34:17,532 --> 00:34:19,333
[SPEAKER_02]: You're the resident Alanis fan.

499
00:34:19,433 --> 00:34:20,013
[SPEAKER_14]: I totally am.

500
00:34:20,414 --> 00:34:23,115
[SPEAKER_14]: That was the music I was listening to before Bomani, and still really.

501
00:34:23,275 --> 00:34:25,276
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I can't listen to DDR music 24-7.

502
00:34:25,556 --> 00:34:26,777
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know how some people out there do that.

503
00:34:27,037 --> 00:34:38,002
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know it's ironic considering the radio station that we do, but even in the radio station we do, I think we have enough diversions away from the normal playlist where even if you listen to our station 24-7, you wouldn't be hearing Bomani 24-7.

504
00:34:39,322 --> 00:34:40,723
[SPEAKER_14]: I like listening to other music once in a while.

505
00:34:41,443 --> 00:34:43,564
[SPEAKER_14]: We can hear a lot of that randomness on Jamie's show.

506
00:34:43,904 --> 00:34:50,088
[SPEAKER_14]: If you ever wondered why does Jamie's show exist on a video gaming network when she plays complete random stuff, that's why.

507
00:34:50,348 --> 00:34:52,710
[SPEAKER_14]: Because you can't listen to gaming music 24-7, I'm sorry.

508
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:55,791
[SPEAKER_14]: You gotta appreciate the other music that's out there once in a while.

509
00:34:55,851 --> 00:35:00,334
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Jamie is your music appreciation speaker.

510
00:35:01,014 --> 00:35:03,736
[SPEAKER_13]: Just like with all the gamers, once in a while you need to go outside.

511
00:35:06,055 --> 00:35:07,376
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, my week of my day was pretty good.

512
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:09,938
[SPEAKER_14]: I just played a lot of Final Fantasy myself.

513
00:35:10,959 --> 00:35:12,099
[SPEAKER_14]: I went out last night.

514
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:13,540
[SPEAKER_14]: I went out to the bar, which was good.

515
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:16,763
[SPEAKER_14]: It was the first time that my buddy, since he'd been out of the hospital, got to go.

516
00:35:16,803 --> 00:35:17,323
[SPEAKER_14]: We had a good time.

517
00:35:17,363 --> 00:35:20,926
[SPEAKER_14]: I drank a little bit and met some people.

518
00:35:21,046 --> 00:35:23,187
[SPEAKER_14]: I like it when strangers randomly come up and talk to me.

519
00:35:23,207 --> 00:35:25,329
[SPEAKER_14]: And there was this girl there who was just like Karen.

520
00:35:25,728 --> 00:35:29,090
[SPEAKER_14]: from Will and Grace, and that made me love her, because, you know, I love Karen on that show.

521
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:31,671
[SPEAKER_14]: If you guys watch Will and Grace, you know it's all about Karen on that show.

522
00:35:32,851 --> 00:35:34,012
[SPEAKER_14]: He knows what I'm talking about.

523
00:35:34,952 --> 00:35:37,653
[SPEAKER_14]: And then, you know, I've been doing a lot of stuff at work.

524
00:35:37,693 --> 00:35:47,698
[SPEAKER_14]: I've been busy, busy at work, and it's kind of funny you talk about your boss making you all do this, you know, cooking thing, because we're doing something similar in my work right now, where, you know, we're doing all these winter events.

525
00:35:48,038 --> 00:35:49,359
[SPEAKER_14]: And you have to be politically correct.

526
00:35:49,399 --> 00:35:51,119
[SPEAKER_14]: You can't say Christmas stuff.

527
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,300
[SPEAKER_14]: It's holiday stuff.

528
00:35:53,621 --> 00:35:56,882
[SPEAKER_14]: So we had a holiday ornament decoration contest and everybody had to participate.

529
00:35:56,902 --> 00:36:00,864
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, you didn't have to, but everybody was supposed to participate in.

530
00:36:02,156 --> 00:36:10,100
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was so busy teaching, because that's what I do at my job, I teach, I was so busy that I did not have a chance to decorate my ornament until about two minutes before.

531
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:18,785
[SPEAKER_14]: So what I did is I printed out a picture of SpongeBob SquarePants' face from the internet, and then I pasted it on the ornament and colored it in yellow highlighter, and it looked pretty.

532
00:36:18,805 --> 00:36:20,566
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a SpongeBob ornament, and it was awesome.

533
00:36:21,526 --> 00:36:24,368
[SPEAKER_14]: And people liked it, though, so, you know, I get points for that.

534
00:36:25,088 --> 00:36:28,370
[SPEAKER_14]: And tomorrow I have to decorate my cube, so what can I say?

535
00:36:28,703 --> 00:36:30,627
[SPEAKER_14]: What is this you're showing in LiveJournal right now?

536
00:36:30,988 --> 00:36:31,308
[SPEAKER_14]: Kitty.

537
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:33,012
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a puppy!

538
00:36:33,292 --> 00:36:33,814
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, it's a puppy?

539
00:36:33,834 --> 00:36:35,056
[SPEAKER_14]: It looks like a kitty from back here.

540
00:36:35,156 --> 00:36:35,898
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a Sheltie.

541
00:36:36,279 --> 00:36:36,699
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, okay.

542
00:36:37,802 --> 00:36:39,625
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for totally derailing this segment.

543
00:36:42,055 --> 00:36:48,920
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, earlier this week, I picked up Final Fantasy Dawn of Souls, which is Final Fantasy 1 and 2 on the Game Boy Advance, and I can't stop playing it.

544
00:36:49,240 --> 00:37:01,689
[SPEAKER_14]: I haven't even touched Final Fantasy 2 yet, I've just been playing Final Fantasy 1, because they totally redid it, they made the battle system more like 4, and just, everything is more like Final Fantasy 4, but, you know, with Final Fantasy 1's story, and it's awesome.

545
00:37:01,809 --> 00:37:03,771
[SPEAKER_14]: I highly recommend it, if you're a Final Fantasy fan.

546
00:37:04,011 --> 00:37:10,215
[SPEAKER_14]: And the great part is, I will sit there, and while I wait for a party in Final Fantasy 11, I'll play Final Fantasy 1 on my DS.

547
00:37:10,575 --> 00:37:10,755
[SPEAKER_14]: So...

548
00:37:11,624 --> 00:37:13,965
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just a total Final Fantasy whore lately.

549
00:37:14,545 --> 00:37:15,125
[SPEAKER_14]: But that's okay.

550
00:37:15,705 --> 00:37:16,085
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm allowed.

551
00:37:17,246 --> 00:37:18,846
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, so that's pretty much my week and my day.

552
00:37:19,766 --> 00:37:19,966
[SPEAKER_14]: So.

553
00:37:21,427 --> 00:37:22,887
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, we're gonna move right along here.

554
00:37:22,987 --> 00:37:32,150
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what's going on tonight, right now, actually, right now, and I hate talking about reasons for you to leave Orange Lounge Radio because you should be listening to our show, you know, all the time.

555
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:33,230
[SPEAKER_14]: However...

556
00:37:34,505 --> 00:37:36,486
[SPEAKER_14]: This is as good of an excuse as any, I figure.

557
00:37:36,506 --> 00:37:39,788
[SPEAKER_14]: If you've got to go, I mean, this would be something I would want to listen to, too.

558
00:37:40,569 --> 00:37:42,570
[SPEAKER_14]: MidiHead, you know, we had him on the show a couple weeks ago.

559
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:46,833
[SPEAKER_14]: He's doing a live spinning thing right now where he's debuting some new material and stuff.

560
00:37:46,853 --> 00:37:50,115
[SPEAKER_14]: It's actually going on right now over on www.midihead.com.

561
00:37:50,135 --> 00:37:52,757
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm trying to work out something where maybe we can play it later.

562
00:37:53,657 --> 00:38:04,004
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm hoping I can hear it a little later, but, you know, if you're a fan of MidiHead and he's a great guy, I know there's a lot of fans out there, you probably would want to check that out at some point, but, you know.

563
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:05,890
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll be sad if you leave.

564
00:38:07,011 --> 00:38:09,251
[SPEAKER_14]: But no, you gotta support all internet radio, so, you know.

565
00:38:10,072 --> 00:38:10,592
[SPEAKER_14]: Do what you gotta do.

566
00:38:10,672 --> 00:38:11,692
[SPEAKER_14]: No, you're not leaving, Loki.

567
00:38:12,432 --> 00:38:12,913
[SPEAKER_14]: You're stuck.

568
00:38:12,933 --> 00:38:13,693
[SPEAKER_14]: You're under contract.

569
00:38:15,633 --> 00:38:16,894
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, yeah.

570
00:38:17,014 --> 00:38:18,694
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a contract sealed with blood.

571
00:38:20,815 --> 00:38:23,116
[SPEAKER_14]: You get paid in meat.

572
00:38:26,077 --> 00:38:26,397
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

573
00:38:29,107 --> 00:38:30,047
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to go to a break.

574
00:38:30,087 --> 00:38:32,968
[SPEAKER_14]: When we come back from the break, we'll talk about some more stuff going on in the Bomani scene.

575
00:38:33,668 --> 00:38:35,188
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to take a call over Skype.

576
00:38:35,208 --> 00:38:38,949
[SPEAKER_14]: There's actually a couple calls I want to do over Skype tonight, but I've got one I want to do right when we come back.

577
00:38:39,549 --> 00:38:46,991
[SPEAKER_14]: Somebody said something very interesting in our chat room, and it has to do with remixes, and it has to do with you, Loki.

578
00:38:47,811 --> 00:38:50,691
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to have him call in and talk about that when we come back from this break.

579
00:38:51,091 --> 00:38:52,992
[SPEAKER_14]: In this break, I promised a fun theme.

580
00:38:53,012 --> 00:38:58,793
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to do happy music, and this is a lot of happy music that was suggested to us by folks in the chat room.

581
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:05,250
[SPEAKER_14]: no happy music yes happy music we'll be back here we go

582
00:41:09,814 --> 00:41:24,578
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought a little bit of you today Look how I felt without myself for you Look a little bit at me today You know you gotta try a little harder So you can be my, my, my, my darling Smile, a little smile, let's enjoy the moment

I'm smiling at you.

587
00:43:30,546 --> 00:43:32,368
I can't go home anymore.

588
00:43:32,408 --> 00:43:34,430
The sweet scent of time is falling.

589
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:35,051
It repeats.

590
00:44:52,193 --> 00:44:53,534
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

591
00:45:15,646 --> 00:45:17,407
[SPEAKER_17]: Bitch, get a new song.

592
00:45:18,067 --> 00:45:20,548
[SPEAKER_17]: An open letter from Orange Lounge Radio.

593
00:45:20,848 --> 00:45:22,089
[SPEAKER_14]: We are back here on Orange Lounge.

594
00:45:22,109 --> 00:45:22,869
[SPEAKER_14]: Whoops, no we're not.

595
00:45:22,889 --> 00:45:23,329
[SPEAKER_14]: There we are.

596
00:45:25,610 --> 00:45:26,771
[SPEAKER_14]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

597
00:45:26,791 --> 00:45:29,192
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that was the very first promo, I think.

598
00:45:30,913 --> 00:45:32,513
[SPEAKER_14]: Me and the ex actually did that one.

599
00:45:33,254 --> 00:45:35,215
[SPEAKER_14]: You can hear the ex singing in that one.

600
00:45:36,155 --> 00:45:39,176
[SPEAKER_02]: I refused to participate in that one.

601
00:45:40,217 --> 00:45:41,277
[SPEAKER_14]: No sing-along for Jamie.

602
00:45:41,297 --> 00:45:42,538
[SPEAKER_02]: I did do the solitary voice.

603
00:45:46,437 --> 00:45:48,438
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember we came up with that one in your car.

604
00:45:51,338 --> 00:45:52,239
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll play the other one later.

605
00:45:52,339 --> 00:45:53,659
[SPEAKER_14]: It was another one we came up with too.

606
00:45:54,059 --> 00:45:54,939
[SPEAKER_14]: It was really all you.

607
00:45:55,479 --> 00:45:56,200
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, it was Dan.

608
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:56,880
[SPEAKER_14]: Really.

609
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:03,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the take on me one.

610
00:46:04,262 --> 00:46:05,162
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll get that in a little later.

611
00:46:05,922 --> 00:46:13,327
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, during the break there, Loki was booting up Step Mania because he wanted to show me some dancing characters in Step Mania.

612
00:46:13,347 --> 00:46:15,469
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess there's some new characters that hit the internet this week.

613
00:46:15,509 --> 00:46:18,251
[SPEAKER_14]: What's going on with Step Mania's dancing characters?

614
00:46:18,811 --> 00:46:21,573
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't think there was a scene for character creation, but apparently there is.

615
00:46:22,574 --> 00:46:23,615
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, there's some funny ones.

616
00:46:24,595 --> 00:46:29,218
[SPEAKER_13]: Vivi from Final Fantasy IX was in there as one of the dancing characters.

617
00:46:29,279 --> 00:46:33,381
[SPEAKER_13]: And then a really crappy done Maria from Silent Hill 3, is it?

618
00:46:34,362 --> 00:46:35,543
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't look like Maria, but whatever.

619
00:46:35,945 --> 00:46:37,826
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, so those are available.

620
00:46:38,326 --> 00:46:45,228
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't remember where they are, though, because the link was on DDR Maniacs, but that site's been down for a few days now.

621
00:46:45,989 --> 00:46:47,529
[SPEAKER_13]: But they're out there.

622
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:49,170
[SPEAKER_13]: God, I can't remember.

623
00:46:49,190 --> 00:46:50,730
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

624
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:52,511
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a site that has a bunch of stuff on there.

625
00:46:53,892 --> 00:46:57,553
[SPEAKER_13]: They did a bunch of... Crap, I can't remember.

626
00:46:57,753 --> 00:46:59,914
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the same site that hosts all the official ones.

627
00:46:59,954 --> 00:47:03,435
[SPEAKER_13]: They have one that the guy has been ripping them from 5th Mix and 3rd Mix now.

628
00:47:04,076 --> 00:47:05,157
[SPEAKER_13]: Master Chief Master Chief

629
00:47:22,065 --> 00:47:25,767
[SPEAKER_14]: And the song that Loki was playing was some sim file for I'm Your Boogeyman by Xtreme.

630
00:47:26,187 --> 00:47:29,828
[SPEAKER_14]: And I could just picture the Master Chief going, I'm your boogeyman, I'm your boogeyman.

631
00:47:29,908 --> 00:47:32,029
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just a really amazing image.

632
00:47:32,389 --> 00:47:34,050
[SPEAKER_14]: But the Vivi one was really good.

633
00:47:34,530 --> 00:47:37,411
[SPEAKER_14]: That was pretty, I mean, it's not perfect, but it's hilarious.

634
00:47:37,491 --> 00:47:38,912
[SPEAKER_14]: It gets the job done.

635
00:47:39,232 --> 00:47:40,012
[SPEAKER_14]: It's fun to watch.

636
00:47:40,072 --> 00:47:41,413
[SPEAKER_14]: So, definitely check that out.

637
00:47:41,453 --> 00:47:46,655
[SPEAKER_14]: If anybody in our chatroom happens to know where those characters are hosted, feel free to post it in chat.

638
00:47:47,015 --> 00:47:51,077
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, it was on DDR Maniacs, but... But, um...

639
00:47:54,542 --> 00:47:57,506
[SPEAKER_14]: We had a little glitch there on Live 365.

640
00:47:57,546 --> 00:47:58,347
[SPEAKER_14]: Comcast farted.

641
00:47:58,467 --> 00:48:00,250
[SPEAKER_14]: What we're going to do, I don't know if it was Comcast.

642
00:48:00,290 --> 00:48:01,772
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't think it was that.

643
00:48:01,812 --> 00:48:03,654
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think it was a station fart.

644
00:48:03,735 --> 00:48:07,420
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to go to a quick break just to make sure folks have a chance to reconnect.

645
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:08,441
[SPEAKER_14]: I hate it when that stuff happens.

646
00:48:08,762 --> 00:48:10,144
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll be right back after this, guys.

647
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:04,387
Thank you for watching!

648
00:50:00,015 --> 00:50:01,696
[SPEAKER_14]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

649
00:50:01,716 --> 00:50:02,217
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry about that.

650
00:50:02,257 --> 00:50:04,218
[SPEAKER_14]: We had some kind of station hiccup.

651
00:50:04,278 --> 00:50:04,938
[SPEAKER_14]: Something happened.

652
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:06,499
[SPEAKER_14]: It happens once in a while.

653
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:08,521
[SPEAKER_14]: Live 365 or something.

654
00:50:08,541 --> 00:50:11,623
[SPEAKER_14]: There was a faulty connection between our house and Live 365.

655
00:50:11,703 --> 00:50:14,484
[SPEAKER_14]: Either a hiccup on our end or a hiccup on their end.

656
00:50:15,685 --> 00:50:20,649
[SPEAKER_14]: I know Live 365 was doing a bunch of maintenance yesterday, so all the Live 365 stations were down.

657
00:50:21,069 --> 00:50:26,153
[SPEAKER_14]: We were down, DDR Freak Radio, Understation Live, all the Live 365 stations were down yesterday.

658
00:50:26,614 --> 00:50:32,358
[SPEAKER_14]: So maybe something's going on with that, I don't know, but we do appear that we are back.

659
00:50:32,698 --> 00:50:41,225
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember, if you ever miss any or all of a show, any part, all of whatever, you can hear the show in its entirety on DDR Freak Radio Live.

660
00:50:41,505 --> 00:50:44,826
[SPEAKER_14]: Friday nights, 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time is when that airs.

661
00:50:45,626 --> 00:50:46,466
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to be interesting, though.

662
00:50:46,486 --> 00:50:50,267
[SPEAKER_14]: I have no idea how that hiccup is going to translate into the archive.

663
00:50:50,347 --> 00:50:53,607
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it just keeps right on going, so you'll hear us going, Crap!

664
00:50:53,627 --> 00:50:54,407
[SPEAKER_00]: Station down!

665
00:50:55,308 --> 00:50:56,208
[SPEAKER_00]: All hands on deck!

666
00:50:58,488 --> 00:50:58,808
[SPEAKER_14]: Weird.

667
00:50:59,108 --> 00:51:00,288
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't know what's going on with that.

668
00:51:00,328 --> 00:51:08,990
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, before we got dropped there, we were talking about new dancing characters in Step Mania, and it looks like Loki found the site where you can actually get those dancing characters from, right?

669
00:51:09,912 --> 00:51:11,093
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it's not this site.

670
00:51:11,133 --> 00:51:13,494
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought it was the same site, but it doesn't look like it is.

671
00:51:13,875 --> 00:51:15,876
[SPEAKER_13]: It was PlasmaDance.com was where some of them were.

672
00:51:16,497 --> 00:51:22,481
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so some of them are on there, PlasmaDance.com, so you can check that out if you are curious about it.

673
00:51:22,521 --> 00:51:24,082
[SPEAKER_14]: Does it have the Master Chief?

674
00:51:24,102 --> 00:51:25,723
[SPEAKER_14]: Because that's the one people really have to get.

675
00:51:25,743 --> 00:51:26,523
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

676
00:51:27,564 --> 00:51:28,205
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, it doesn't?

677
00:51:28,245 --> 00:51:29,105
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, forget it then.

678
00:51:29,926 --> 00:51:30,686
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't waste your time.

679
00:51:31,247 --> 00:51:31,787
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just kidding.

680
00:51:32,087 --> 00:51:33,228
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a lot of good ones on there, though.

681
00:51:33,868 --> 00:51:34,889
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

682
00:51:36,590 --> 00:51:38,071
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow, trying to get back on track here.

683
00:51:38,411 --> 00:51:38,532
[SPEAKER_14]: Um...

684
00:51:39,437 --> 00:51:57,147
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see, what I wanted to do now is I wanted to actually go to the phones on the Skype line, and if you want to participate in the Skype line, just go to our website, www.orangeloundtrader.com, and click on Interact With Us, and it's got all the details on how you can actually interact with the program.

685
00:51:57,207 --> 00:52:06,612
[SPEAKER_14]: And actually, there's a specific person I'm looking to hear from that I'm hoping will be calling us in a minute here, because he was talking about something in chat earlier.

686
00:52:07,617 --> 00:52:10,038
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're going to open up the Skype line so he can get through.

687
00:52:10,639 --> 00:52:14,381
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm specifically looking for the person I have a prearranged phone interview with.

688
00:52:14,481 --> 00:52:16,082
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you're somebody else, don't worry.

689
00:52:16,102 --> 00:52:17,663
[SPEAKER_14]: You'll have an opportunity to call him to the show later.

690
00:52:19,144 --> 00:52:20,305
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

691
00:52:21,845 --> 00:52:24,727
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, is my phone on?

692
00:52:24,947 --> 00:52:26,128
[SPEAKER_14]: You're fading out there a little bit.

693
00:52:26,168 --> 00:52:29,430
[SPEAKER_14]: Make sure all your other transfers and your bandwidth is open there.

694
00:52:30,170 --> 00:52:30,631
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you hear us?

695
00:52:32,712 --> 00:52:33,052
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello.

696
00:52:33,772 --> 00:52:34,013
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello.

697
00:52:34,333 --> 00:52:34,473
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi.

698
00:52:34,513 --> 00:52:34,573
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi.

699
00:52:36,756 --> 00:52:37,316
[SPEAKER_12]: Am I okay?

700
00:52:37,656 --> 00:52:38,537
[SPEAKER_14]: I think so.

701
00:52:38,637 --> 00:52:39,837
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll just keep going with this.

702
00:52:39,877 --> 00:52:40,318
[SPEAKER_14]: Who is this?

703
00:52:41,238 --> 00:52:42,358
[SPEAKER_12]: This is John Fields.

704
00:52:42,639 --> 00:52:43,539
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, John Fields.

705
00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:43,999
[SPEAKER_14]: How are you?

706
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:45,600
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm doing fine.

707
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:46,120
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

708
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:47,841
[SPEAKER_14]: What did you call in to talk to us about tonight?

709
00:52:47,981 --> 00:52:49,001
[SPEAKER_14]: By OC Remix.

710
00:52:49,441 --> 00:52:49,842
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what?

711
00:52:50,122 --> 00:52:50,462
[SPEAKER_14]: Right now.

712
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:24,922
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that song's kind of fitting right now, a little gentle stress being caused by faulty internet connections.

713
00:54:24,962 --> 00:54:26,842
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to keep going with this best we can, guys.

714
00:54:27,603 --> 00:54:29,263
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what to tell you, though, about that.

715
00:54:30,824 --> 00:54:31,944
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if it's on our end.

716
00:54:32,044 --> 00:54:35,565
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think it's on our end, because we haven't been having any internet problems for a long time now.

717
00:54:35,585 --> 00:54:42,548
[SPEAKER_14]: I know we used to have a lot of problems with internet here, but ever since the really cool tech guy came out, we haven't really been having problems, have we, Loki?

718
00:54:43,508 --> 00:54:43,908
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it's...

719
00:54:45,049 --> 00:54:47,612
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, the real cool tech guy came out and just used pliers.

720
00:54:47,693 --> 00:54:49,675
[SPEAKER_13]: Something I could have done in like three seconds.

721
00:54:49,875 --> 00:54:50,536
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what?

722
00:54:50,576 --> 00:54:51,638
[SPEAKER_14]: He thought of it and you didn't.

723
00:54:51,678 --> 00:54:52,339
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the point.

724
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:57,125
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I can't help it if he's more experienced with their faulty equipment.

725
00:54:57,626 --> 00:54:58,827
[SPEAKER_14]: So, yeah.

726
00:54:58,947 --> 00:55:01,971
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, again, if you missed all our part, you can always tune into...

727
00:55:03,854 --> 00:55:05,035
[SPEAKER_14]: And now we're having sound issues.

728
00:55:05,115 --> 00:55:07,477
[SPEAKER_14]: My God, if enough stuff wouldn't break around here.

729
00:55:09,378 --> 00:55:12,761
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, you can always tune in to DDR Free Radio to hear the archive in full.

730
00:55:13,641 --> 00:55:19,526
[SPEAKER_14]: Along with other live programming that goes on throughout the week here on Orange Lounge Radio, which usually doesn't get affected by this kind of stuff.

731
00:55:19,546 --> 00:55:23,288
[SPEAKER_14]: You can tune in to Pump Up the Volume on Tuesday nights, hosted by the lovely Dark Sakura.

732
00:55:24,129 --> 00:55:27,291
[SPEAKER_14]: Monday nights, Diversion, Orange Lounge Radio, Bomani Remixes.

733
00:55:27,952 --> 00:55:29,473
[SPEAKER_14]: And Thursday nights...

734
00:55:30,242 --> 00:55:35,745
[SPEAKER_14]: Outside the Box, which will be in reruns this week, actually, because I'm going to be out this week.

735
00:55:36,165 --> 00:55:38,146
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to be out and about in L.A.

736
00:55:38,206 --> 00:55:38,947
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm actually going to L.A.

737
00:55:38,967 --> 00:55:39,187
[SPEAKER_14]: this week.

738
00:55:39,207 --> 00:55:47,711
[SPEAKER_14]: I was kind of hoping that I'd get to go to Arcade Infinity while I was down in L.A., but it doesn't look like that's going to happen, because me and four coworkers actually have to share a car.

739
00:55:47,771 --> 00:55:48,392
[SPEAKER_14]: Doesn't that suck?

740
00:55:50,373 --> 00:55:51,573
[SPEAKER_02]: A tremendous amount of ass.

741
00:55:51,634 --> 00:55:55,255
[SPEAKER_02]: However, there's a good noodle place over there by A.I.

742
00:55:56,696 --> 00:55:57,877
[SPEAKER_02]: You can suggest going there for dinner.

743
00:55:58,615 --> 00:55:59,535
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe, I don't know.

744
00:56:00,476 --> 00:56:01,796
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really, really a good place.

745
00:56:01,816 --> 00:56:03,937
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll have to see.

746
00:56:04,657 --> 00:56:06,338
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, more to do.

747
00:56:07,958 --> 00:56:09,639
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're still getting sound issues.

748
00:56:09,659 --> 00:56:10,880
[SPEAKER_14]: This is bad.

749
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:11,540
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, guys.

750
00:56:13,481 --> 00:56:14,221
[SPEAKER_14]: Everything's breaking.

751
00:56:15,546 --> 00:56:16,386
[SPEAKER_14]: We keep going down.

752
00:56:16,867 --> 00:56:17,907
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to call it a show.

753
00:56:19,308 --> 00:56:20,289
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm getting pretty pissy here.

754
00:56:20,949 --> 00:56:21,309
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll see.

755
00:56:21,909 --> 00:56:22,370
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll keep going.

756
00:56:22,390 --> 00:56:23,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go get sushi.

757
00:56:23,670 --> 00:56:24,191
[SPEAKER_14]: Seriously?

758
00:56:24,211 --> 00:56:25,091
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm like, mmm, food.

759
00:56:25,111 --> 00:56:35,177
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, let's go to another break and just kind of hope things are good when we come back and we'll try calling John again and get out some more Bomani news and just keep doing what we do here.

760
00:56:35,577 --> 00:56:37,738
[SPEAKER_14]: So we'll be back after this little break here.

761
00:56:38,378 --> 00:56:41,940
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we'll do that Silent Hill break I was talking about earlier.

762
00:56:42,541 --> 00:56:43,121
[SPEAKER_14]: So we'll be back.

763
00:56:43,861 --> 00:56:45,222
[SPEAKER_14]: Happy holidays to everybody out there.

764
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:14,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

765
00:58:37,876 --> 00:58:38,857
Thank you for watching!

766
00:58:59,938 --> 00:59:09,022
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be a much better fight With you, with me If you hadn't met me I'd be fine on my own, baby Never felt so lonely when you came along

767
00:59:18,986 --> 00:59:20,707
[SPEAKER_05]: So now what should I do?

768
00:59:20,867 --> 00:59:28,789
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm strung out, addicted to you My body aches, now that you're gone My supplies fell through Let me give me everything you have

769
00:59:39,552 --> 00:59:40,393
Thank you for watching!

770
01:00:24,705 --> 01:00:37,449
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope you're drinking and toasting It's such a special day Tonight, tonight, oh, I love you

771
01:00:53,263 --> 01:01:00,410
Christmas is here, Christmas is here Night, nightfall, I love you

772
01:01:48,287 --> 01:01:51,689
[SPEAKER_17]: We often wonder how some of those Bomani songs are chosen.

773
01:01:57,833 --> 01:01:58,955
[SPEAKER_11]: We think we figured it out.

774
01:01:58,975 --> 01:02:00,076
[SPEAKER_11]: Orange Lounge Radio.

775
01:02:00,096 --> 01:02:00,557
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, we're back.

776
01:02:15,959 --> 01:02:17,220
[SPEAKER_14]: And hopefully things are stable.

777
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:21,083
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the internet is just completely fucked tonight, basically, is what it boils down to.

778
01:02:21,103 --> 01:02:28,389
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I notice people keep dropping from our chat room, left and right, and the Skype chat a little bit earlier was really kind of freaky.

779
01:02:28,769 --> 01:02:30,151
[SPEAKER_14]: So, we're under attack!

780
01:02:30,791 --> 01:02:32,192
[SPEAKER_14]: The internet is screwed!

781
01:02:32,853 --> 01:02:33,793
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what's going on.

782
01:02:34,434 --> 01:02:35,595
[SPEAKER_02]: The internet's on vacation.

783
01:02:36,436 --> 01:02:37,977
[SPEAKER_02]: I cannot find anything on this damn game.

784
01:02:38,390 --> 01:02:38,550
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello?

785
01:02:38,570 --> 01:02:39,091
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, John, you there?

786
01:03:05,626 --> 01:03:05,806
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep.

787
01:03:06,067 --> 01:03:07,588
[SPEAKER_14]: Good, and you sound a lot better this time.

788
01:03:08,049 --> 01:03:09,631
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I think the internet might be fixed.

789
01:03:10,392 --> 01:03:10,652
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

790
01:03:10,792 --> 01:03:11,213
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll see.

791
01:03:11,413 --> 01:03:12,414
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, from the top.

792
01:03:12,795 --> 01:03:16,139
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you were in the Overclocked Remix channel this week.

793
01:03:16,899 --> 01:03:17,100
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep.

794
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:18,802
[SPEAKER_14]: And you were asking about fusion mixes.

795
01:03:19,784 --> 01:03:35,249
[SPEAKER_12]: Right, I was wondering, after what came out today, which was, I believe, another B4U remix or something like that, I was wondering if maybe we could try getting Loki's remixes in there just for fun.

796
01:03:35,329 --> 01:03:40,150
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, first you've got to talk Loki into it, because he's pretty protective over his material there.

797
01:03:42,429 --> 01:03:44,610
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I spoke with one of the higher-ups today.

798
01:03:46,231 --> 01:03:46,791
[SPEAKER_12]: The higher-up?

799
01:03:46,871 --> 01:03:51,334
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there an OC hierarchy or something?

800
01:03:51,414 --> 01:03:52,554
[SPEAKER_14]: The Trump of OC?

801
01:03:52,594 --> 01:03:53,415
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, no, I'm kidding.

802
01:03:54,435 --> 01:04:02,420
[SPEAKER_12]: Basically, what it is, is it's like most of the chat channel users are unvoiced, and the higher-ups, they are voiced.

803
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:03,260
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

804
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:07,622
[SPEAKER_12]: And then there's pretty much DJ Pretzel and then a couple of bots, I think, up at top.

805
01:04:07,942 --> 01:04:08,203
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

806
01:04:09,303 --> 01:04:09,963
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, gotcha.

807
01:04:10,564 --> 01:04:10,884
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was...

808
01:04:11,383 --> 01:04:14,846
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow, now how many DDR remixes are on OC Remix?

809
01:04:15,787 --> 01:04:16,608
[SPEAKER_12]: Not a lot, right?

810
01:04:16,628 --> 01:04:19,611
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's like three or four right now, I think.

811
01:04:33,615 --> 01:04:34,316
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you say, Loki?

812
01:04:35,337 --> 01:04:36,579
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, he's looking at the site right now.

813
01:04:38,081 --> 01:04:39,683
[SPEAKER_12]: He's sizing it up.

814
01:04:39,924 --> 01:04:40,164
[SPEAKER_14]: What?

815
01:04:40,785 --> 01:04:42,827
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a request for more Bimani, actually.

816
01:04:42,847 --> 01:04:44,870
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a request for more Bimani.

817
01:04:44,970 --> 01:04:46,432
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, I'm moving the mic over to you.

818
01:04:46,452 --> 01:04:46,993
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you think of this?

819
01:04:48,755 --> 01:04:49,837
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

820
01:04:52,168 --> 01:04:53,529
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, see, I like OC Remix.

821
01:04:53,589 --> 01:04:54,189
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a good site.

822
01:04:54,229 --> 01:04:55,990
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a lot of really good remixes on there.

823
01:04:56,311 --> 01:04:58,052
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it would be pretty exciting if you got it on there.

824
01:04:58,372 --> 01:04:59,012
[SPEAKER_14]: And you know what?

825
01:04:59,172 --> 01:05:05,536
[SPEAKER_14]: Yet again, you could just continue to kick those people who say that Fusion remixes are not real remixes.

826
01:05:05,836 --> 01:05:19,745
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, not only did you get MidiHead, who actually has a song in DDR on here a couple weeks ago, saying he used his ass in his mixes, but then you could get one of these mixes on OC Remix and you would just, you know, you would have the hugest internet penis.

827
01:05:19,985 --> 01:05:20,726
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, seriously.

828
01:05:21,586 --> 01:05:22,767
[SPEAKER_14]: Almost as big as Jason's.

829
01:05:23,127 --> 01:05:29,589
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think it would fall, I think under the fact, if I remember correctly, I don't think it would be allowed, actually.

830
01:05:29,609 --> 01:05:38,993
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, no, I don't think it would work.

831
01:05:40,214 --> 01:05:47,817
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't think it would work because of the fact that you mix your songs with other songs that are already out there, so you're kind of using too much commercial music, is that what you think the problem is?

832
01:05:49,588 --> 01:05:55,153
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it's copyright music, because I have no permission from the original artist.

833
01:05:56,754 --> 01:05:59,357
[SPEAKER_13]: But, I mean, I don't know.

834
01:05:59,697 --> 01:06:03,400
[SPEAKER_12]: There are songs on there that have remixed licensed songs, I think.

835
01:06:03,721 --> 01:06:07,444
[SPEAKER_12]: I think there's like a Jingle Bells on there, mixed with Super Mario World, I think.

836
01:06:09,106 --> 01:06:11,428
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, but Jingle Bells is public domain.

837
01:06:12,449 --> 01:06:12,869
[SPEAKER_13]: I think so.

838
01:06:13,770 --> 01:06:15,031
[SPEAKER_13]: Wait, maybe, I don't know.

839
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:18,091
[SPEAKER_14]: Even the happy birthday song is not public domain, if you can believe that.

840
01:06:18,251 --> 01:06:21,732
[SPEAKER_14]: You know every time you sing the happy birthday song, you're supposed to give some guy a quarter, basically?

841
01:06:22,132 --> 01:06:24,273
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, not really, but you know, happy birthday is a copyrighted song.

842
01:06:24,853 --> 01:06:26,874
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, Loki's gonna look into it, John.

843
01:06:27,174 --> 01:06:28,254
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the most we can do for you.

844
01:06:28,914 --> 01:06:29,515
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

845
01:06:29,615 --> 01:06:31,155
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm hoping he'll do it.

846
01:06:31,195 --> 01:06:31,895
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it would be good.

847
01:06:32,616 --> 01:06:32,876
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

848
01:06:33,136 --> 01:06:35,257
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm all for whoring out the show everywhere possible.

849
01:06:36,297 --> 01:06:36,577
[SPEAKER_14]: You know.

850
01:06:36,637 --> 01:06:38,938
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for looking out for us, so keep us posted.

851
01:06:39,578 --> 01:06:39,918
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

852
01:06:40,078 --> 01:06:40,598
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, later.

853
01:06:41,359 --> 01:06:41,579
[SPEAKER_14]: Bye.

854
01:06:41,639 --> 01:06:41,839
[SPEAKER_14]: Bye.

855
01:06:43,755 --> 01:06:45,336
[SPEAKER_14]: Our chat room is being a bunch of babies again.

856
01:06:46,496 --> 01:06:49,397
[SPEAKER_14]: They're complaining because the webcam isn't showing anything.

857
01:06:50,658 --> 01:06:53,479
[SPEAKER_14]: Angel, go sit on the couch so they have someone to look at.

858
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:59,121
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm forcing Angel to go sit on the couch so you have someone to look at.

859
01:07:00,421 --> 01:07:02,102
[SPEAKER_14]: That was my impression of the chat room.

860
01:07:02,362 --> 01:07:05,623
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't say that you can't, so I guess you could.

861
01:07:06,483 --> 01:07:08,584
[SPEAKER_13]: I could submit it because it doesn't say that you can't.

862
01:07:08,664 --> 01:07:11,225
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not in their submission guideline things here.

863
01:07:11,832 --> 01:07:15,816
[SPEAKER_13]: All it says is that, you know, you have to be the original artist of, you know, whatever it is.

864
01:07:16,636 --> 01:07:18,198
[SPEAKER_13]: But it doesn't say you can't.

865
01:07:19,078 --> 01:07:23,102
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, well... Okay, I don't know.

866
01:07:24,663 --> 01:07:27,046
[SPEAKER_14]: The worst that could happen is they call you a lamer.

867
01:07:27,286 --> 01:07:27,786
[SPEAKER_14]: Honestly.

868
01:07:29,428 --> 01:07:31,369
[SPEAKER_14]: What's the worst that could happen if you submitted a song?

869
01:07:33,211 --> 01:07:33,711
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

870
01:07:34,832 --> 01:07:37,895
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm trying to talk him into doing it, but he's being a pussy.

871
01:07:39,321 --> 01:07:48,144
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, anyway, moving right along, what's this stuff, you were talking during the break there, you were reading some various Bomani sites, finding out something going on with Poppin' Music?

872
01:07:48,244 --> 01:07:56,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Poppin' Music Iroha, which I don't know crap about because I wasn't keeping up with Poppin' Music, but apparently Poppin' Music Iroha was out last week, so.

873
01:07:58,426 --> 01:07:59,587
[SPEAKER_14]: And is that just Poppin' Music 12?

874
01:07:59,787 --> 01:08:03,088
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't, yeah, I think so.

875
01:08:03,108 --> 01:08:03,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it?

876
01:08:03,228 --> 01:08:03,488
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

877
01:08:04,403 --> 01:08:04,783
[SPEAKER_14]: Hooray!

878
01:08:04,843 --> 01:08:06,044
[SPEAKER_14]: Another poppin' music!

879
01:08:06,104 --> 01:08:07,525
[SPEAKER_14]: Just what we need right now, you know?

880
01:08:07,946 --> 01:08:09,286
[SPEAKER_14]: No, actually, I like poppin' music.

881
01:08:10,107 --> 01:08:14,330
[SPEAKER_14]: Good time, but... I would pull up... God, I wish they'd make a new DDR.

882
01:08:14,730 --> 01:08:20,474
[SPEAKER_02]: On my laptop, but I still need to install the Japanese language patch, so... Alright.

883
01:08:21,435 --> 01:08:23,416
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you say we get into a cage match for tonight?

884
01:08:24,257 --> 01:08:24,677
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure!

885
01:08:24,917 --> 01:08:28,660
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, let's cue up the music, then.

886
01:08:31,138 --> 01:08:32,819
[SPEAKER_14]: Who's going to go first in tonight's cage match?

887
01:08:32,839 --> 01:08:36,000
[SPEAKER_14]: You know we had to retire somebody last week, so now we get to go in whatever order we want.

888
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:36,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't you start, Rob?

889
01:08:37,241 --> 01:08:37,941
[SPEAKER_14]: I get to start?

890
01:08:38,081 --> 01:08:38,482
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, goody.

891
01:08:40,382 --> 01:08:40,723
[SPEAKER_14]: Hold on.

892
01:08:42,043 --> 01:08:42,323
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

893

894
01:08:50,336 --> 01:09:16,259
[SPEAKER_14]: On your favorite song, which will go into rotation all week long On Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Music and More program Which plays 24 hours a day, 7 days a week on this station When there's no live program So, last week in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, we retired a song It has won for a month straight, meaning it's gone Here it is, a final send-off for Gwen Stefani, Whatcha Waitin' For

895
01:09:57,435 --> 01:10:00,636
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, everybody say goodbye to Gwen Stefani.

896
01:10:00,756 --> 01:10:02,456
[SPEAKER_14]: She is being retired.

897
01:10:04,389 --> 01:10:07,891
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, so we're going to go ahead and say goodbye to Gwen Stefani.

[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, she is retired from the Orange Lens Radio Cage Match.

899
01:10:14,315 --> 01:10:17,497
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, so that means you guys get three brand new songs tonight.

900
01:10:17,557 --> 01:10:19,498
[SPEAKER_14]: Jamie has decided that I'm going to go first.

[SPEAKER_02]: I declare this as official woman of Orange Lounge Radio.

[SPEAKER_14]: I have the chair.

904
01:10:26,459 --> 01:10:26,899
[SPEAKER_14]: Fair enough.

905
01:10:27,179 --> 01:10:31,481
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, my song, and how appropriate what my song is tonight.

906
01:10:32,241 --> 01:10:34,762
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to have to dedicate this one to Jamie for that comment.

907
01:10:37,743 --> 01:10:38,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'm going to eat clean beef.

908
01:10:39,372 --> 01:10:51,097
[SPEAKER_14]: My song is a song called Bitch, and it's by a group called J-Punch, and it's from this Trance Anthems compilation I found, and I liked it.

909
01:10:51,397 --> 01:10:56,439
[SPEAKER_14]: So here it is, song number one in tonight's cage match that you can vote for, Bitch, the open air remix.

And I hate myself And I try You're a bitch You're a bitch

912
01:14:04,591 --> 01:14:08,672
[SPEAKER_14]: Song number one in tonight's cage match, Bitch, the open air remix by J-Punch.

913
01:14:09,372 --> 01:14:09,892
[SPEAKER_14]: Jamie!

914
01:14:11,573 --> 01:14:13,953
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty good, I have to say.

915
01:14:14,414 --> 01:14:17,094
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot more energetic than most trance you play.

916
01:14:17,114 --> 01:14:19,155
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's an eight.

917
01:14:20,475 --> 01:14:21,355
[SPEAKER_14]: And you are a bitch.

918
01:14:22,476 --> 01:14:23,276
I'm being serious!

919
01:14:23,296 --> 01:14:24,716
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

920
01:14:25,436 --> 01:14:26,497
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm offended!

921
01:14:26,697 --> 01:14:27,697
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I love you, Jamie.

922
01:14:29,281 --> 01:14:29,521
Angel!

923
01:14:29,601 --> 01:14:32,344
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll give it an eight and a half.

924
01:14:32,364 --> 01:14:32,784
[SPEAKER_14]: That's pretty cool.

925
01:14:32,824 --> 01:14:33,045
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

926
01:14:33,085 --> 01:14:33,185
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki!

927
01:14:33,205 --> 01:14:33,585
[SPEAKER_14]: This is okay.

928
01:14:33,625 --> 01:14:34,226
[SPEAKER_14]: Eight and a half.

929
01:14:51,881 --> 01:14:53,643
[SPEAKER_14]: I give it an 8.

930
01:14:54,123 --> 01:15:03,591
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, honestly, I didn't think you guys would like that one at all, and it looks like our chatroom doesn't, so it probably doesn't have much of a chance, but even though it's a little repetitive, I like songs that say bitch.

931
01:15:03,711 --> 01:15:04,311
[SPEAKER_14]: What can I say?

932
01:15:05,492 --> 01:15:06,573
[SPEAKER_14]: So it gets 8 points for that.

933
01:15:06,913 --> 01:15:08,855
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, let's move on to Jamie's pick.

934
01:15:08,875 --> 01:15:09,856
[SPEAKER_14]: Jamie, what'd you pick tonight?

935
01:15:11,094 --> 01:15:17,958
[SPEAKER_02]: I chose a song that I'm sure everyone's probably heard, but it just really suited my mood for the past week or so.

936
01:15:19,119 --> 01:15:22,000
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Delirium with Sarah McLachlan, Silence.

937
01:15:23,141 --> 01:15:26,723
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just really, it's very, very somber.

938
01:15:27,364 --> 01:15:29,325
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, so a mood-fitting one.

939
01:15:29,905 --> 01:15:36,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and really, I just put it in because I've been listening to it just off and on all week, so...

940
01:15:38,576 --> 01:15:39,976
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, let's hear it.

941
01:15:40,016 --> 01:15:41,097
[SPEAKER_14]: Delirium with silence.

942
01:15:41,177 --> 01:15:41,597
[SPEAKER_14]: Enjoy.

943
01:15:41,617 --> 01:15:45,718
[SPEAKER_14]: Delirium with silence.

944
01:17:17,984 --> 01:17:20,465
Lyrics, Lyrics, Lyrics, Lyrics

945
01:18:34,123 --> 01:18:35,150
DarkSakura.com

946
01:19:51,234 --> 01:19:56,598
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, that was song number two in tonight's cage match, courtesy of DarkSakura, Delirium, with Sarah McLachlan, Silence.

947
01:19:57,697 --> 01:19:58,357
[SPEAKER_14]: Jamie, what'd you think?

948
01:19:58,997 --> 01:19:59,738
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that song.

949
01:19:59,898 --> 01:20:07,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, I've been listening to it a whole bunch, so it gets an automatic 10 for me, just from having been completely fitting my mood all week.

950
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:08,240
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

951
01:20:08,260 --> 01:20:09,401
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a de-stressing song.

952
01:20:09,881 --> 01:20:10,261
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

953
01:20:10,521 --> 01:20:10,921
[SPEAKER_14]: Fair enough.

954
01:20:10,961 --> 01:20:11,221
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki.

955
01:20:12,742 --> 01:20:13,082
[SPEAKER_13]: God.

956
01:20:14,302 --> 01:20:16,763
[SPEAKER_13]: This sounds like a sex scene, that's all it sounds like.

957
01:20:18,063 --> 01:20:19,724
[SPEAKER_13]: I've heard this song so many times.

958
01:20:21,244 --> 01:20:21,765
[SPEAKER_13]: It's good.

959
01:20:21,785 --> 01:20:23,685
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's an 8.

960
01:20:25,806 --> 01:20:26,006
[SPEAKER_00]: Angel.

961
01:20:26,574 --> 01:20:29,855
[SPEAKER_18]: It's Delirium, so I would probably give it a 9.

962
01:20:32,015 --> 01:20:51,320
[SPEAKER_14]: Me, personally, about two years ago I would have given that song a 10, but I've played the fuck out of it since then, so I would give it an 8, but then I remembered that Delirium's kind of popular again in the Bomani scene because of After All being an Ultramix 2, so that's a good chance for those that haven't heard that song before to kind of hear a little bit else of Delirium, so I give it a 9 overall.

963
01:20:52,540 --> 01:20:52,820
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

964
01:20:54,252 --> 01:20:57,874
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see, song number three tonight comes to you courtesy of Loki.

965
01:20:58,254 --> 01:21:04,456
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember, if you don't agree with our votes, which apparently in the chat room a lot of you guys disagree with the way we felt about song number one, and you can blow me.

966
01:21:06,337 --> 01:21:08,678
[SPEAKER_14]: But remember, it does come down to your vote in the chat room.

967
01:21:08,778 --> 01:21:12,580
[SPEAKER_14]: So we'll be voting as soon as this song's done that comes to you via Loki.

968
01:21:12,620 --> 01:21:13,620
[SPEAKER_14]: And what song are we going to hear?

969
01:21:15,121 --> 01:21:18,202
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, if you grew up in the 80s, then you already know what this song is.

970
01:21:18,482 --> 01:21:22,644
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you've watched, you know, The Breakfast Club, then you already know what this song is.

971
01:21:23,635 --> 01:21:31,280
[SPEAKER_13]: This is the Simple Minds with Don't You Forget About Me, and it's not sung horribly, like myself, or the singer in Karaoke Revolution.

972
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:34,702
[SPEAKER_14]: What's up with you guys and old school songs tonight?

973
01:21:35,422 --> 01:21:36,583
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, fair enough.

974
01:21:37,003 --> 01:21:39,665
[SPEAKER_14]: Anything's game here in the Orange Lounge Cage Match, and this is it.

975
01:21:39,725 --> 01:21:41,206
[SPEAKER_14]: Simple Minds, Don't You Forget About Me.

976
01:21:41,286 --> 01:21:41,526
[SPEAKER_14]: Enjoy.

977
01:22:26,696 --> 01:22:29,318
Won't you come see about me?

978
01:22:29,459 --> 01:22:51,118
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be alone, dancing, you know it, baby Tell me your troubles and doubts Giving me everything, inside and out and Love's strange, surreal and bizarre Think of the tender things that we were working on

979
01:22:52,479 --> 01:23:08,488
[SPEAKER_05]: No change may pull us apart When the light gets into your heart, baby Don't you forget about me Don't, don't, don't, don't Don't you forget about me

980
01:23:20,335 --> 01:23:21,436
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

981
01:23:46,790 --> 01:23:47,772
Thanks for watching!

982
01:24:10,482 --> 01:24:12,264
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

983
01:24:44,979 --> 01:24:57,864
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't you forget about me Don't, don't, don't, don't Don't you forget about me Will you stand above me Look my way, will you ever love me Rain keeps falling

984
01:25:14,352 --> 01:25:15,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

985
01:26:11,228 --> 01:26:23,261
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't you forget about me Don't, don't, don't, don't Don't you forget about me But you won't come by Where you call my name

986
01:27:06,302 --> 01:27:08,408
I won't call my name Will you call my name

987
01:27:45,885 --> 01:27:47,214
Thanks for watching!

988
01:28:15,825 --> 01:28:19,726
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, song number three in tonight's Cage Match, Simple Minds, Don't You Forget About Me.

989
01:28:19,886 --> 01:28:20,346
[SPEAKER_14]: Jamie?

990
01:28:21,226 --> 01:28:22,587
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the song to bits.

991
01:28:24,267 --> 01:28:26,388
[SPEAKER_02]: So much, and I'm so glad it's not a crappy remix.

992
01:28:27,688 --> 01:28:32,949
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, there are 80 songs that I like better, but I really like that one a whole lot, so it gets a nine.

993
01:28:34,110 --> 01:28:34,870
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, Loki?

994
01:28:37,531 --> 01:28:39,391
[SPEAKER_13]: I like that song, so it gets a ten.

995
01:28:40,791 --> 01:28:42,452
[SPEAKER_13]: Because, I don't know...

996
01:28:45,049 --> 01:28:53,452
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know why, I just, I like that song a lot, and it just reminds me of every, you know, John Hughes film when I see that, you know, or listen to that song.

997
01:28:53,472 --> 01:28:55,933
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

998
01:28:55,953 --> 01:28:59,554
[SPEAKER_13]: I wish they'd play it more on the 80s station that we have locally instead of the Reflex.

999
01:28:59,594 --> 01:29:01,735
[SPEAKER_13]: They play the Reflex goddamn 50 times a day.

1000
01:29:04,456 --> 01:29:07,657
[SPEAKER_14]: I just remembered, I was gonna do a Duran Duran song tonight, and I totally forgot.

1001
01:29:07,757 --> 01:29:08,317
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, anyway.

1002
01:29:09,437 --> 01:29:09,778
[SPEAKER_14]: Angel!

1003
01:29:10,718 --> 01:29:12,779
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, it's 80s, so you know what that means.

1004
01:29:12,799 --> 01:29:13,439
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll give it a 10.

1005
01:29:15,499 --> 01:29:18,320
[SPEAKER_14]: Me personally, I love that song a lot.

1006
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:21,141
[SPEAKER_14]: I just would have loved it at DDR length a lot more.

1007
01:29:21,361 --> 01:29:25,263
[SPEAKER_14]: That song went on forever, so I give it a 6 for the number of minutes it was.

1008
01:29:29,104 --> 01:29:39,068
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, let's review the songs you can vote for tonight, starting off with song number 1, which is a song called Bitch by J-Punch.

1009
01:29:49,229 --> 01:30:16,523
[SPEAKER_14]: and song number two that you can vote for tonight is Delirium featuring Sarah McLachlan with Silence and song number three you can vote for tonight Simple Minds, Don't You Forget About Me

1010
01:30:26,906 --> 01:30:29,888
[SPEAKER_14]: Place vote now.

1011
01:30:29,948 --> 01:30:34,390
[SPEAKER_14]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.

1012
01:30:34,911 --> 01:30:37,072
[SPEAKER_14]: And we'll tally them up and see who the winner is.

1013
01:30:38,041 --> 01:30:42,089
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, meanwhile, some stuff's going on here locally in town.

1014
01:30:42,129 --> 01:30:46,157
[SPEAKER_14]: We just, um, we found out something going on at one of our local arcades.

1015
01:30:46,197 --> 01:30:48,341
[SPEAKER_14]: We've talked about it a little bit on this show, Arvigil.

1016
01:30:49,637 --> 01:30:50,237
[SPEAKER_14]: RVGL.

1017
01:30:51,417 --> 01:30:55,378
[SPEAKER_14]: And this new rumor has come up, although you can't really call it a rumor.

1018
01:30:55,418 --> 01:31:00,279
[SPEAKER_14]: I would say it's in that stage where it hasn't happened yet, but it's a lot more solid than a rumor.

1019
01:31:00,739 --> 01:31:04,000
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's kind of a... It's a congealed mass.

1020
01:31:04,140 --> 01:31:04,860
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, basically.

1021
01:31:04,900 --> 01:31:12,181
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what you would call it when it's not really a rumor because there's lots of facts backing it up, but it hasn't happened yet either, so it's an almost stage.

1022
01:31:12,481 --> 01:31:15,742
[SPEAKER_14]: But that is that Rosal Goughlin's going to get a 2DX machine, basically.

1023
01:31:16,282 --> 01:31:16,762
Woo-hoo!

1024
01:31:18,076 --> 01:31:19,933
[SPEAKER_14]: What I think is most exciting about this

1025
01:31:20,976 --> 01:31:24,298
[SPEAKER_14]: is the fact that I think this is going to bring people back to RVGL.

1026
01:31:24,318 --> 01:31:29,000
[SPEAKER_14]: Because let's face it, it's winter time now, so there's not as many stupid theme park kids hanging around there.

1027
01:31:30,461 --> 01:31:34,423
[SPEAKER_14]: And honestly, we've been kind of missing something like this for a while.

1028
01:31:34,443 --> 01:31:34,863
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what I mean?

1029
01:31:34,883 --> 01:31:41,547
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember when we used to have those Wednesday nights over at Golfland, and we'd all go, and man, what was new in those days?

1030
01:31:41,627 --> 01:31:43,948
[SPEAKER_14]: That wasn't extreme, was still kind of the... We had Fourth Mix.

1031
01:31:44,308 --> 01:31:44,889
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.

1032
01:31:45,449 --> 01:31:47,090
[SPEAKER_02]: Our big meeting days was back in the day.

1033
01:31:47,110 --> 01:31:47,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Max and Max 2 were the best.

1034
01:31:47,930 --> 01:31:48,210
[SPEAKER_02]: That was it.

1035
01:31:48,230 --> 01:31:49,351
[SPEAKER_02]: We were trying to unlock stuff.

1036
01:31:52,539 --> 01:31:58,681
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I remember that, because everybody was trying to unlock stuff in Max 2, and I kept trying to get AAAs on songs.

1037
01:31:58,841 --> 01:32:04,884
[SPEAKER_14]: I would just play sets of basic songs to try and get AAAs, because that was 10 points off if you could get a AAA.

1038
01:32:04,924 --> 01:32:05,344
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember that?

1039
01:32:05,484 --> 01:32:05,904
[SPEAKER_14]: That was fun.

1040
01:32:06,284 --> 01:32:07,865
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we'd all go to Brookfields afterwards.

1041
01:32:08,465 --> 01:32:17,569
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sure somewhere in your town, I know we're national, in some cases international broadcasts, I know maybe in your neck of the woods you guys do something similar, but we haven't been doing this for about a year and a half when...

1042
01:32:18,129 --> 01:32:19,170
[SPEAKER_14]: And how long do we freaking tell them?

1043
01:32:19,210 --> 01:32:19,550
[SPEAKER_14]: Seriously.

1044
01:32:19,570 --> 01:32:20,772
[SPEAKER_14]: I give it... One week.

1045
01:32:41,551 --> 01:32:42,151
[SPEAKER_13]: and it's inoperable.

1046
01:32:42,171 --> 01:32:42,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, broken.

1047
01:32:43,172 --> 01:32:44,072
[SPEAKER_13]: One weekend's broken.

1048
01:32:44,213 --> 01:32:48,115
[SPEAKER_02]: I will take a step further and say that the DVD drive goes out.

1049
01:32:49,916 --> 01:32:50,676
[SPEAKER_13]: One weekend's broken.

1050
01:32:50,756 --> 01:32:58,340
[SPEAKER_13]: They're buying a new monitor for it because I guess the monitor that was on it was fucked and... That was probably like the old sugar monitor, huh?

1051
01:32:58,980 --> 01:32:59,201
Yes.

1052
01:33:00,821 --> 01:33:05,084
[SPEAKER_13]: So, um... I give it a week before the little kids fuck it up.

1053
01:33:05,684 --> 01:33:09,166
[SPEAKER_02]: I still think it's gonna be the DVD drive that goes out or someone's gonna spill something on the panel.

1054
01:33:10,207 --> 01:33:10,847
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to be shit.

1055
01:33:11,188 --> 01:33:16,250
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm afraid it's going to make people even more pissed off because it's just another game that they're not going to fix up.

1056
01:33:18,131 --> 01:33:19,171
[SPEAKER_13]: But hey, whatever.

1057
01:33:19,671 --> 01:33:21,032
[SPEAKER_13]: Whatever makes you happy, I guess.

1058
01:33:21,272 --> 01:33:23,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever sinks your battleship.

1059
01:33:27,655 --> 01:33:30,956
[SPEAKER_14]: I totally agree with the fact that some little kid is probably going to spill something on it.

1060
01:33:30,996 --> 01:33:34,157
[SPEAKER_14]: I just hope they put the machine in a place where somebody can watch it.

1061
01:33:35,058 --> 01:33:35,378
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

1062
01:33:36,969 --> 01:33:39,591
[SPEAKER_14]: What can they do to help 2DX not die?

1063
01:33:39,711 --> 01:33:42,313
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you guys think they could do?

1064
01:33:43,694 --> 01:33:49,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a guard posted there 24-7 and have a height bar for you to be able to go up to the machine.

1065
01:33:49,819 --> 01:33:51,620
[SPEAKER_14]: That guard will be you, Jamie.

1066
01:33:52,861 --> 01:33:53,822
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll pay me, okay.

1067
01:33:59,006 --> 01:33:59,386
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

1068
01:34:00,287 --> 01:34:02,048
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm tallying up the votes for the cage match right now.

1069
01:34:02,088 --> 01:34:06,612
[SPEAKER_14]: What else do you think would be something fun that we could do to kind of get the crowds going at Golf Land again?

1070
01:34:09,639 --> 01:34:12,020
[SPEAKER_13]: How about they fix my fucking machine that I built them?

1071
01:34:12,040 --> 01:34:15,841
[SPEAKER_13]: They spent all my hard time on and then went to shit really quick.

1072
01:34:15,961 --> 01:34:16,581
[SPEAKER_13]: How about that?

1073
01:34:17,742 --> 01:34:18,502
[SPEAKER_13]: That might be nice.

1074
01:34:20,423 --> 01:34:22,323
[SPEAKER_13]: Seriously, I don't know why I even try anymore.

1075
01:34:22,343 --> 01:34:23,764
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, why do I try?

1076
01:34:23,784 --> 01:34:24,944
[SPEAKER_13]: Because it just goes to shit.

1077
01:34:26,405 --> 01:34:26,785
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck them.

1078
01:34:27,225 --> 01:34:27,785
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what I say.

1079
01:34:27,885 --> 01:34:28,245
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck them.

1080
01:34:28,625 --> 01:34:30,526
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I'm going to make my own machine.

1081
01:34:31,086 --> 01:34:32,307
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll fucking make my own arcade.

1082
01:34:32,607 --> 01:34:33,387
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the way it'll be.

1083
01:34:34,507 --> 01:34:36,228
[SPEAKER_13]: But, you know, I'm just tired of it.

1084
01:34:37,048 --> 01:34:39,069
[SPEAKER_13]: Tired of spending my time there trying to fix shit.

1085
01:34:39,554 --> 01:34:39,974
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, they have Doc!

1086
01:35:09,233 --> 01:35:09,914
[SPEAKER_13]: and Derby on Earth.

1087
01:35:11,436 --> 01:35:12,977
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to go race Gungoro again.

1088
01:35:13,718 --> 01:35:17,001
[SPEAKER_14]: Part of me kind of wants to go to Arvigil tomorrow to see if they got the machine up and running.

1089
01:35:17,262 --> 01:35:28,614
[SPEAKER_14]: I just, another fact that makes me very happy that Arvigil's getting 2DX is that I really don't like going to Svigil to play and I apologize if you're a Svigil regular but there's a lot of you guys that hang out there that are kind of dicks.

1090
01:35:29,375 --> 01:35:38,804
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, but I just feel this very thick dickiness when I walk into Spiggle.

1091
01:35:38,864 --> 01:35:45,431
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like, if you can't pass eight stars, then you suck and you shouldn't even deserve to play here.

1092
01:35:45,451 --> 01:35:50,676
[SPEAKER_14]: And they don't tell people when they get new machines and stuff because they don't want scary newbies around and stuff.

1093
01:35:50,696 --> 01:35:52,718
[SPEAKER_14]: And I just don't like that attitude, you know what I mean?

1094
01:35:53,258 --> 01:36:02,744
[SPEAKER_14]: and I'm sorry, because I have friends that play Svigal, you know, I'm not saying this is a, every single person is like this, but I just feel this aura of shittiness when I walk in there, and I'm sorry.

1095
01:36:03,044 --> 01:36:09,328
[SPEAKER_14]: So that makes me very happy that Arvigil is going to be getting a machine, because I think a lot of people, even though Arvigil is kind of a...

1096
01:36:11,535 --> 01:36:12,156
[SPEAKER_14]: How do you put it?

1097
01:36:12,456 --> 01:36:15,558
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a dump in pretty rapping, basically.

1098
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:19,261
[SPEAKER_14]: The people there really are pretty good.

1099
01:36:19,661 --> 01:36:25,446
[SPEAKER_14]: And I sense a lot of friendly people and, you know, I think more of a, you know, just try your best type attitude.

1100
01:36:25,486 --> 01:36:26,507
[SPEAKER_14]: At least that's how I feel.

1101
01:36:26,567 --> 01:36:26,867
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

1102
01:36:26,907 --> 01:36:27,628
[SPEAKER_14]: You feel that, Jamie?

1103
01:36:28,108 --> 01:36:28,688
[SPEAKER_14]: Or is it just me?

1104
01:36:30,570 --> 01:36:31,370
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, she's watching.

1105
01:36:31,651 --> 01:36:32,171
[SPEAKER_14]: What about you, Loki?

1106
01:36:32,191 --> 01:36:35,794
[SPEAKER_14]: Have you been to play at Spiegel?

1107
01:36:36,454 --> 01:36:37,195
[SPEAKER_13]: A few times.

1108
01:36:38,032 --> 01:36:39,433
[SPEAKER_13]: It's too cramped for my taste.

1109
01:36:39,953 --> 01:36:42,275
[SPEAKER_13]: They have way too many machines and a way too small arcade.

1110
01:36:42,295 --> 01:36:44,857
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the only thing I got from it.

1111
01:36:46,418 --> 01:36:47,498
[SPEAKER_13]: But, I don't know.

1112
01:36:47,899 --> 01:36:48,859
[SPEAKER_13]: They have In The Groove now.

1113
01:36:50,521 --> 01:36:53,102
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess that's not, I don't know.

1114
01:36:54,283 --> 01:36:56,865
[SPEAKER_13]: I wouldn't want to play In The Groove, but you know, that's just me.

1115
01:36:59,181 --> 01:37:08,346
[SPEAKER_13]: But you know, honestly, I would rather them put in the groove in that cabinet that's broken right now than, you know, have it be just not working at all.

1116
01:37:08,826 --> 01:37:13,128
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I'd rather have that cabinet being used for something other than just to sit there broken.

1117
01:37:15,429 --> 01:37:21,752
[SPEAKER_13]: And if that's what they gotta do, then go ahead, buy the machine, put it in there, so then we can upgrade it to mine with working parts.

1118
01:37:24,694 --> 01:37:27,815
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, I don't want to bash on everybody that goes to Sviggle.

1119
01:37:27,835 --> 01:37:29,576
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not trying to start any drama or anything.

1120
01:37:29,596 --> 01:37:33,838
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just I've had one too many kind of shitty experiences when I was there.

1121
01:37:33,958 --> 01:37:35,839
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm sure there's a lot of great people.

1122
01:37:35,859 --> 01:37:37,579
[SPEAKER_14]: In fact, I know there's a lot of great people that play Sviggle.

1123
01:37:37,619 --> 01:37:40,521
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just that there's a lot of attitude that comes along with Sviggle.

1124
01:37:40,541 --> 01:37:41,501
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't know.

1125
01:37:41,801 --> 01:37:45,963
[SPEAKER_14]: As far as In the Groove goes, you know, I talked about the game before on the show.

1126
01:37:46,003 --> 01:37:48,304
[SPEAKER_14]: I got to play it, and it's okay.

1127
01:37:48,344 --> 01:37:49,364
[SPEAKER_14]: There's things I like about it.

1128
01:37:49,384 --> 01:37:50,385
[SPEAKER_14]: There's things I don't like about it.

1129
01:37:50,765 --> 01:37:52,706
[SPEAKER_14]: I would rather see In the Groove than nothing.

1130
01:37:52,746 --> 01:37:53,987
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it's a nice little addition.

1131
01:37:54,027 --> 01:37:55,547
[SPEAKER_14]: It's something I would play once in a while.

1132
01:37:55,887 --> 01:37:57,788
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not something I'm going to go gaga over.

1133
01:37:58,008 --> 01:38:01,290
[SPEAKER_14]: It is not a replacement for DDR, I don't think.

1134
01:38:02,130 --> 01:38:04,251
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's something to kind of pass the time.

1135
01:38:04,951 --> 01:38:07,473
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, the one thing that always kind of bugged me about...

1136
01:38:08,713 --> 01:38:15,819
[SPEAKER_14]: Excuse me, the one thing that always kind of bugs me about In The Groove is that In The Groove is not DDR unless it's convenient for it to be DDR.

1137
01:38:15,899 --> 01:38:16,400
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what I mean?

1138
01:38:16,840 --> 01:38:20,123
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, when it's convenient to say it's the new DDR, then it's the new DDR.

1139
01:38:20,163 --> 01:38:24,086
[SPEAKER_14]: But when, you know, it's being bashed on, then oh well, you can't say that because it's not DDR.

1140
01:38:24,367 --> 01:38:25,748
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of like, you know, make up your mind.

1141
01:38:25,788 --> 01:38:26,528
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it DDR or not?

1142
01:38:27,089 --> 01:38:28,490
[SPEAKER_14]: So, we'll see.

1143
01:38:29,531 --> 01:38:34,075
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, Jamie, did you have any thoughts on...

1144
01:38:35,582 --> 01:38:38,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I'm sorry, I had to take care of some business.

1145
01:38:38,703 --> 01:38:39,123
[SPEAKER_14]: That's alright.

1146
01:38:39,743 --> 01:38:41,244
[SPEAKER_02]: About, in the groove?

1147
01:38:42,144 --> 01:38:46,305
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, anything, either in the groove or Svigel versus, you know, other places.

1148
01:38:46,325 --> 01:38:49,926
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I, Svigel's like... It's not necessarily our Vigel, specifically, just Svigel in general.

1149
01:38:49,946 --> 01:38:57,008
[SPEAKER_02]: No offense to the Sviglers, but walking into that place is like walking into, you know, a garage that somebody's put too much crap in.

1150
01:38:58,449 --> 01:38:58,569
[SPEAKER_02]: It's...

1151
01:39:00,385 --> 01:39:02,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Just not comfortable there.

1152
01:39:03,026 --> 01:39:10,827
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd rather go to Miggle, where there's tons of room, generally nicer, more attentive people, than go waste my time at SVGL.

1153
01:39:11,827 --> 01:39:13,628
[SPEAKER_02]: No offense to any of my friends that go there.

1154
01:39:17,309 --> 01:39:17,989
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I feel.

1155
01:39:19,649 --> 01:39:19,969
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

1156
01:39:20,189 --> 01:39:21,009
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that's what we think.

1157
01:39:21,049 --> 01:39:24,090
[SPEAKER_14]: If you disagree, you're welcome to join the chat or call us on the Skype line a little later.

1158
01:39:24,770 --> 01:39:28,091
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, meanwhile, you guys want to figure out who won the cage match?

1159
01:39:29,502 --> 01:39:35,785
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, we're going to go to Cage Match, and the winner is... This is a very unique situation.

1160
01:39:37,366 --> 01:39:42,148
[SPEAKER_14]: Tonight, in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, we had a three-way tie.

1161
01:39:42,408 --> 01:39:43,248
[SPEAKER_14]: No way!

1162
01:39:43,428 --> 01:39:48,671
[SPEAKER_14]: Three-way tie, and a lot of people voted tonight, and it's still a three-way tie.

1163
01:39:49,311 --> 01:39:50,232
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's the weird thing.

1164
01:39:51,112 --> 01:39:57,575
[SPEAKER_14]: Typically in a three-way tie, then the song that got thrown out, whoever put that song in, gets to vote on the winner.

1165
01:39:58,407 --> 01:40:03,129
[SPEAKER_14]: But the problem is, there is no song being thrown out this week because there are three brand new songs.

1166
01:40:03,869 --> 01:40:14,874
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have to go to Plan B. And basically what happens in Plan B, and I think this has only ever happened one time in show history, is that everybody else in the room who isn't a host gets to vote on the song that wins.

1167
01:40:15,404 --> 01:40:16,385
[SPEAKER_02]: But we only have one person.

1168
01:40:16,465 --> 01:40:18,846
[SPEAKER_14]: Which means there's only one other person here in the room tonight.

1169
01:40:19,506 --> 01:40:22,788
[SPEAKER_14]: That means Angel is going to break the tie, so I gave her a little piece of paper.

1170
01:40:23,328 --> 01:40:28,330
[SPEAKER_14]: She's going to write down on there her favorite song to win tonight's cage match.

1171
01:40:28,431 --> 01:40:29,011
[SPEAKER_14]: No pressure.

1172
01:40:32,813 --> 01:40:34,914
[SPEAKER_14]: But she's thinking about her vote.

1173
01:40:40,497 --> 01:40:40,957
[SPEAKER_14]: That's right.

1174
01:40:47,250 --> 01:40:48,291
[SPEAKER_14]: She's walking to her pen.

1175
01:40:49,612 --> 01:40:51,273
[SPEAKER_14]: She's writing it down on the piece of paper.

1176
01:40:54,275 --> 01:40:54,636
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1177
01:40:55,817 --> 01:40:56,277
[SPEAKER_14]: You just got it?

1178
01:40:56,337 --> 01:40:56,637
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1179
01:40:57,378 --> 01:40:59,059
[SPEAKER_14]: I have the vote in my hand.

1180
01:40:59,119 --> 01:41:04,103
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember, once the votes are tallied, the other two songs have to leave.

1181
01:41:06,044 --> 01:41:06,885
[SPEAKER_14]: I will now read the vote.

1182
01:41:10,526 --> 01:41:17,047
[SPEAKER_14]: The winning song of tonight's cage match as decided on by DDR Angel.

1183
01:41:17,548 --> 01:41:20,848
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there any particular, oh I have to ask you first, is there any particular reason you voted for this song?

1184
01:41:22,009 --> 01:41:22,209
[SPEAKER_18]: No.

1185
01:41:26,930 --> 01:41:27,250
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

1186
01:41:30,010 --> 01:41:31,171
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see, should I walk over to the cam?

1187
01:41:31,531 --> 01:41:31,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

1188
01:41:32,031 --> 01:41:32,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1189
01:41:34,511 --> 01:41:36,552
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a big moment in Orange Lounge Radio history.

1190
01:41:43,902 --> 01:41:44,522
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see, here we go.

1191
01:41:47,304 --> 01:41:57,790
[SPEAKER_14]: And the winning song for tonight is song number one.

1192
01:41:58,531 --> 01:41:59,731
[SPEAKER_14]: Song number one.

1193
01:42:02,373 --> 01:42:05,835
[SPEAKER_14]: So that means by a three-way tiebreaker,

1194
01:42:06,636 --> 01:42:08,357
[SPEAKER_18]: See, now everyone's dying in the chatroom.

1195
01:42:08,377 --> 01:42:09,038
[SPEAKER_18]: What have I done?

1196
01:42:09,058 --> 01:42:15,823
[SPEAKER_14]: Bitch wins the cage match, which is ironic because it's the song that got dogged on the most by the chatroom.

1197
01:42:18,925 --> 01:42:20,306
[SPEAKER_14]: Hold on, I gotta play the victory lap here.

1198
01:42:25,890 --> 01:42:26,991
[SPEAKER_14]: Bitch wins tonight's cage match.

1199
01:42:27,011 --> 01:42:28,392
[SPEAKER_14]: Any particular reason you picked that one?

1200
01:42:28,652 --> 01:42:32,595
[SPEAKER_14]: You gave that one the lowest score out of the three, so I'm kind of surprised that you voted for that one.

1201
01:42:32,615 --> 01:42:35,678
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I kind of thought of it, and, well, I don't know, I kind of like it.

1202
01:42:35,718 --> 01:42:36,038
[SPEAKER_18]: It's kind of...

1203
01:42:37,314 --> 01:42:41,581
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, it's more, I guess you could call it a club song, I don't know.

1204
01:42:43,383 --> 01:42:44,886
[SPEAKER_18]: Most dancey out of the three, I guess.

1205
01:42:45,492 --> 01:42:50,055
[SPEAKER_14]: That actually makes me happy because the chatroom was so, like, anti that song.

1206
01:42:50,075 --> 01:42:51,196
[SPEAKER_18]: See, they don't like it too bad.

1207
01:42:52,517 --> 01:42:54,319
[SPEAKER_14]: You guys voted for it in a three-way tie.

1208
01:42:54,379 --> 01:42:57,221
[SPEAKER_14]: If any one of you had voted differently, it would have been different.

1209
01:42:57,301 --> 01:42:57,741
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm kidding.

1210
01:42:57,781 --> 01:42:58,502
[SPEAKER_18]: I love you, chatroom.

1211
01:42:58,622 --> 01:42:59,503
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, there you have it.

1212
01:43:00,483 --> 01:43:03,285
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, so Bitch will be back next week with two new songs.

1213
01:43:03,646 --> 01:43:04,286
[SPEAKER_14]: That was good, though.

1214
01:43:04,306 --> 01:43:05,787
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't get three-way ties very often.

1215
01:43:06,288 --> 01:43:10,611
[SPEAKER_14]: But it was an exact, it was a multiple of three votes, and every one had the same amount.

1216
01:43:10,631 --> 01:43:10,851
[SPEAKER_14]: It's crazy.

1217
01:43:10,871 --> 01:43:13,353
[SPEAKER_18]: Wasn't this one, like, the second time it's happened or something?

1218
01:43:13,733 --> 01:43:15,014
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's only like the second time it's happened.

1219
01:43:15,035 --> 01:43:15,295
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1220
01:43:15,335 --> 01:43:15,515
[SPEAKER_14]: Ever.

1221
01:43:16,776 --> 01:43:17,056
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

1222
01:43:17,297 --> 01:43:18,338
[SPEAKER_18]: I feel special now.

1223
01:43:18,578 --> 01:43:18,998
[SPEAKER_18]: Yay!

1224
01:43:20,600 --> 01:43:20,920
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

1225
01:43:20,980 --> 01:43:24,003
[SPEAKER_14]: We can thank Diebold Voting Machines for bringing us that result.

1226
01:43:24,464 --> 01:43:26,466
[SPEAKER_14]: Just kidding.

1227
01:43:28,007 --> 01:43:33,132
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, we're gonna go to a break and in this break we're gonna hear, I don't know, what kind of music should we hear this break?

1228
01:43:34,493 --> 01:43:35,334
[SPEAKER_14]: Any requests, Jamie?

1229
01:43:35,454 --> 01:43:36,015
[SPEAKER_14]: Anything you want to hear?

1230
01:43:38,422 --> 01:43:49,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, very, very, the first ever versions of songs that have been remixed to the point of making people physically ill.

1231
01:43:49,908 --> 01:43:51,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, Paranoia.

1232
01:43:51,089 --> 01:43:53,230
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow, okay.

1233
01:43:53,730 --> 01:43:57,052
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow, that is a crazy theme, okay, but we can do that.

1234
01:43:57,092 --> 01:43:57,212
[SPEAKER_02]: Max 300.

1235
01:43:58,032 --> 01:43:58,292
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1236
01:43:58,492 --> 01:43:59,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Pre-remix.

1237
01:43:59,433 --> 01:43:59,713
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

1238
01:44:00,854 --> 01:44:05,536
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and actually just for the hell of it, because I hadn't heard it in forever, Dropout.

1239
01:44:07,150 --> 01:44:09,411
[SPEAKER_14]: Even though that has nothing to do with... Even though.

1240
01:44:09,611 --> 01:44:09,871
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1241
01:44:09,911 --> 01:44:11,131
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I can't think of any others.

1242
01:44:11,171 --> 01:44:12,951
[SPEAKER_14]: My God, I don't think I have the original Paranoia.

1243
01:44:12,971 --> 01:44:14,192
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not in the Potpourri directory.

1244
01:44:14,232 --> 01:44:14,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, okay.

1245
01:44:14,792 --> 01:44:15,632
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you what.

1246
01:44:15,752 --> 01:44:16,232
[SPEAKER_14]: Trip Machine.

1247
01:44:16,932 --> 01:44:17,492
[SPEAKER_14]: Want Trip Machine?

1248
01:44:18,273 --> 01:44:18,313
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1249
01:44:18,333 --> 01:44:18,913
[SPEAKER_14]: Do I have Trip Machine?

1250
01:44:18,953 --> 01:44:19,633
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like Trip Machine.

1251
01:44:19,693 --> 01:44:19,973
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1252
01:44:20,613 --> 01:44:21,453
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll do the next 300.

1253
01:44:21,653 --> 01:44:22,173
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's it.

1254
01:44:24,454 --> 01:44:26,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Throw in QQQ.

1255
01:44:27,995 --> 01:44:28,495
[SPEAKER_14]: QQQ.

1256
01:44:28,695 --> 01:44:29,275
[SPEAKER_14]: For no good reason.

1257
01:44:29,295 --> 01:44:29,795
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1258
01:44:30,295 --> 01:44:30,995
[SPEAKER_14]: For no good reason.

1259
01:44:31,035 --> 01:44:31,756
[SPEAKER_02]: For no good reason.

1260
01:44:32,256 --> 01:44:33,036
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Taku.

1261
01:44:35,362 --> 01:44:36,905
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say thank you for that.

1262
01:44:37,266 --> 01:44:38,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Ha ha pun.

1263
01:44:39,290 --> 01:44:39,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Shoot me.

1264
01:44:41,154 --> 01:44:43,439
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll be right back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

1265
01:45:37,824 --> 01:45:38,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

1266
01:49:00,745 --> 01:49:00,987
[SPEAKER_06]: and more.

1267
01:49:52,032 --> 01:49:56,356
[SPEAKER_17]: Orange Lounge Radio is proud to present a celebrity interview.

1268
01:49:57,216 --> 01:49:58,858
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you introduce yourself for our listeners?

1269
01:49:59,318 --> 01:50:00,159
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm Miss Cleo.

1270
01:50:00,699 --> 01:50:02,280
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, it's great to have you on the show today.

1271
01:50:02,621 --> 01:50:03,782
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello, how are you today?

1272
01:50:04,262 --> 01:50:05,223
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm great, thanks.

1273
01:50:05,403 --> 01:50:06,424
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you have a question?

1274
01:50:06,844 --> 01:50:12,749
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, yes, actually I wanted to know... Can I please have your first name only and your birth date, please?

1275
01:50:13,850 --> 01:50:13,930
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh...

1276
01:50:14,813 --> 01:50:18,455
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, no, I actually just wanted to know what you thought of Orange Lounge Radio.

1277
01:50:18,735 --> 01:50:19,595
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, go ahead.

1278
01:50:19,976 --> 01:50:23,137
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, what do you think of Loki, one of the three hosts of Orange Lounge Radio?

1279
01:50:23,497 --> 01:50:24,398
[SPEAKER_10]: Is he incarcerated?

1280
01:50:25,058 --> 01:50:28,680
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, actually, no, he's not, but what do you think of the ever-ranty Dark Sakura?

1281
01:50:28,820 --> 01:50:30,101
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, dear, how are you?

1282
01:50:30,681 --> 01:50:31,421
[SPEAKER_10]: I love you.

1283
01:50:31,641 --> 01:50:33,142
[SPEAKER_14]: I see you two must know each other.

1284
01:50:33,262 --> 01:50:34,543
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, what do you think of Skye?

1285
01:50:34,863 --> 01:50:36,784
[SPEAKER_10]: Did he used to play football when he was in high school?

1286
01:50:37,044 --> 01:50:38,485
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, actually, no, he didn't.

1287
01:50:38,545 --> 01:50:38,725
[SPEAKER_14]: Haha!

1288
01:50:39,696 --> 01:50:41,557
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, what do you think of Intern Zero?

1289
01:50:41,997 --> 01:50:45,380
[SPEAKER_10]: I want you to really remember the pill, all right?

1290
01:50:45,860 --> 01:50:51,083
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm seeing some forgetting, possibly, and I'm seeing a new baby in the next three months.

1291
01:50:51,824 --> 01:50:52,224
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

1292
01:50:52,524 --> 01:50:55,446
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, well, thanks for being on Orange Lounge Radio today.

1293
01:50:55,586 --> 01:51:04,211
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't mean to sidetrack your question here, but who are all of these nosy people, outside influences I'm seeing around you by the moon card?

1294
01:51:04,391 --> 01:51:05,292
[SPEAKER_17]: Get away from me.

1295
01:51:07,842 --> 01:51:12,663
[SPEAKER_17]: Orange Lounge Radio, helping to free your mind and spirit.

1296
01:51:13,123 --> 01:51:13,963
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm Miss Cleo.

1297
01:51:14,324 --> 01:51:15,064
[SPEAKER_10]: I love you.

1298
01:51:19,405 --> 01:51:22,405
[SPEAKER_14]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1299
01:51:23,366 --> 01:51:25,546
[SPEAKER_14]: Episode number 122 in progress.

1300
01:51:26,406 --> 01:51:28,407
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't believe we've been doing this crap this long.

1301
01:51:28,427 --> 01:51:29,147
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you believe that?

1302
01:51:30,587 --> 01:51:32,308
[SPEAKER_14]: I like your shirt there, Angel, that you're wearing.

1303
01:51:32,328 --> 01:51:36,009
[SPEAKER_14]: The old classic Nintendo controller there with the Know Your Roots.

1304
01:51:36,029 --> 01:51:37,329
[SPEAKER_14]: I've seen that for sale before.

1305
01:51:38,163 --> 01:51:46,693
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it's been around, but, you know, I mean... You always wear some kind of 8-bit shirt when you come over here, I notice.

1306
01:51:46,793 --> 01:51:48,475
[SPEAKER_14]: I just, I kind of notice this trend.

1307
01:51:48,515 --> 01:51:51,799
[SPEAKER_14]: You have your, uh, are you the one with the Mega Man shirt?

1308
01:51:51,839 --> 01:51:53,801
[SPEAKER_14]: Or you have the Piranha Plant that says, Bite Me?

1309
01:51:54,061 --> 01:51:55,743
[SPEAKER_18]: I have the Piranha Plant that says, Bite Me.

1310
01:51:55,823 --> 01:51:57,866
[SPEAKER_18]: I have the, uh...

1311
01:51:59,132 --> 01:52:01,333
[SPEAKER_18]: I got Mad Bills, which is the Bullet Bill one.

1312
01:52:01,753 --> 01:52:08,975
[SPEAKER_18]: It's got all the different ones on it.

1313
01:52:09,135 --> 01:52:12,476
[SPEAKER_14]: The only one I have is the Goomba one that says you lose.

1314
01:52:12,516 --> 01:52:16,277
[SPEAKER_14]: I actually wore that to the Live 365 Awards, so that was kind of an omen that year.

1315
01:52:17,817 --> 01:52:27,300
[SPEAKER_18]: Yep, and the same day that I had picked up the Bite Me shirt, I washed it and wore it over here.

1316
01:52:28,072 --> 01:52:29,393
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1317
01:53:01,964 --> 01:53:03,665
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll just have to take your word for it, I suppose.

1318
01:53:03,825 --> 01:53:06,186
[SPEAKER_18]: I believe it's Arden, actually, now that I think about it.

1319
01:53:06,386 --> 01:53:07,187
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, fair enough.

1320
01:53:07,767 --> 01:53:09,228
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, let's see.

1321
01:53:09,768 --> 01:53:12,569
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to go on over to Loki, if you don't mind.

1322
01:53:13,270 --> 01:53:17,772
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was curious what's going on in the sim scene right now, besides the dancing characters, of course.

1323
01:53:17,812 --> 01:53:19,313
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there any other news going on out there right now?

1324
01:53:20,734 --> 01:53:24,015
[SPEAKER_13]: Besides numerous websites being down, not really, no.

1325
01:53:24,836 --> 01:53:24,916
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh...

1326
01:53:26,758 --> 01:53:28,820
[SPEAKER_13]: No, really, actually, nothing's going on at all.

1327
01:53:29,340 --> 01:53:31,322
[SPEAKER_13]: I couldn't really tell you any updates on Step Mini.

1328
01:53:31,342 --> 01:53:36,387
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think there have been any new releases of it since Release Candidate 2, if I remember correctly.

1329
01:53:38,589 --> 01:53:50,940
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that they're still hard at work over on DDRUK on getting those sim files out for... Was it a Dancing Stage Fusion and... Let's see...

1330
01:53:52,168 --> 01:54:20,324
[SPEAKER_13]: DDR Festival and Ultramix 2 those are almost done I think Festival is close to being done they're waiting on graphics and Ultramix 2 they're still working on and I would assume by now that Fusion's done because that game's been out forever now I think they're just going to be doing like one update where they have them all up online but still nothing yet on those but should be soon hopefully

1331
01:54:21,400 --> 01:54:44,977
[SPEAKER_13]: and then, um, really other than that, I don't think there's anything else going on, sort of sim-related, um, Funmix Plus, um, it was just announced, actually, that they're going to be releasing, of course, exclusively in Japan, um, a soundtrack for Funmix Plus and Funmix, I guess, it's going to be out there, there's a little demo on the Funmix site, I don't remember the URL by it,

1332
01:54:45,498 --> 01:54:51,846
[SPEAKER_13]: OffChance right now, but that's going to be coming out eventually with all extended tracks and stuff from your favorite Foon Mix artists.

1333
01:54:53,268 --> 01:54:57,654
[SPEAKER_13]: And really other than that, not much going on right now.

1334
01:54:58,234 --> 01:54:58,655
[SPEAKER_13]: Pretty quiet.

1335
01:54:59,707 --> 01:55:01,548
[SPEAKER_14]: That Foon Mix soundtrack sounds pretty exciting, though.

1336
01:55:01,568 --> 01:55:02,568
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd be looking forward to that.

1337
01:55:02,608 --> 01:55:04,168
[SPEAKER_14]: Foon Mix is some good stuff.

1338
01:55:04,328 --> 01:55:13,771
[SPEAKER_14]: And I wouldn't even call them Bomani remixes, because they're almost these completely different songs that are just kind of inspired by familiar Bomani tunes.

1339
01:55:14,151 --> 01:55:17,172
[SPEAKER_14]: Not just those, but their original stuff is freaking great, too.

1340
01:55:17,252 --> 01:55:19,593
[SPEAKER_14]: So hats off to those guys for putting a soundtrack together.

1341
01:55:20,445 --> 01:55:49,741
[SPEAKER_13]: and as I mentioned probably last week and the week before last and so on and so forth um there's the brand new um Diverse Systems album that's coming out called and this was as you may remember Dear Mr. 180 well now we have Dear Mr. Desire which is all remixes which is ironically enough it's remixes of Revenge and Desire songs so um get all your Trip Machine, Cigaru and Healing Vision uh remixes out there um they're all uh on this one um

1342
01:55:50,441 --> 01:55:59,468
[SPEAKER_13]: CD from Diverse Systems, and also the Food Mix CD should be available through Silly Walker, which is another Diverse Systems-like site.

1343
01:56:00,029 --> 01:56:09,736
[SPEAKER_13]: Fortunately, all these sites being located in Japan, they're only selling exclusively in Japan, so it's really hard to get a hold of this stuff, especially if you don't speak Japanese.

1344
01:56:11,077 --> 01:56:14,360
[SPEAKER_13]: It's pretty hard to find it, but it's out there, so you know.

1345
01:56:16,311 --> 01:56:29,809
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that Diverse Systems is re-updating their entire English page, so I'm sure that D7 along with this brand new album should be up there eventually as soon as they get done with that, probably next year.

1346
01:56:32,620 --> 01:56:34,121
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, good times.

1347
01:56:36,803 --> 01:56:38,564
[SPEAKER_14]: Moving right along, excuse me.

1348
01:56:38,624 --> 01:56:57,757
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, going back to a topic that we had going on earlier in this show, John, you know John in our chat room, he actually went to the OC Remix and got one of them to come over here to try and talk you into, I don't know if they're here to talk you into it or what, but answer any questions you may have about the OC Remix policy.

1349
01:56:58,057 --> 01:57:00,159
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what, Loki, I think you're just going to have to do it.

1350
01:57:01,644 --> 01:57:02,305
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't care.

1351
01:57:02,425 --> 01:57:05,887
[SPEAKER_13]: I just don't think it's, you know, usually... You think you're not worthy.

1352
01:57:05,967 --> 01:57:06,508
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that what it is?

1353
01:57:07,349 --> 01:57:07,849
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess.

1354
01:57:08,029 --> 01:57:10,491
[SPEAKER_14]: You've got all these listeners telling you you're worthy.

1355
01:57:10,591 --> 01:57:11,152
[SPEAKER_14]: Just do it.

1356
01:57:11,552 --> 01:57:11,952
[SPEAKER_14]: Do it!

1357
01:57:11,992 --> 01:57:12,392
[SPEAKER_14]: Do it, Loki!

1358
01:57:12,413 --> 01:57:12,813
[SPEAKER_14]: Do it!

1359
01:57:12,853 --> 01:57:13,393
[SPEAKER_14]: Do it!

1360
01:57:13,433 --> 01:57:14,194
[SPEAKER_18]: Do it!

1361
01:57:14,274 --> 01:57:14,934
[SPEAKER_18]: Do it!

1362
01:57:15,955 --> 01:57:16,516
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess.

1363
01:57:17,156 --> 01:57:18,297
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the spirit.

1364
01:57:18,317 --> 01:57:19,278
[SPEAKER_18]: Yay!

1365
01:57:20,759 --> 01:57:21,019
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

1366
01:57:21,860 --> 01:57:23,281
[SPEAKER_14]: So you guys can be looking forward to that.

1367
01:57:25,042 --> 01:57:28,465
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it would be funny if we went through all that and then they say, oh, sorry, this sucks.

1368
01:57:30,447 --> 01:57:30,807
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd laugh.

1369
01:57:31,124 --> 01:57:34,566
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, it'll give us good material for next week's show, so I'm down for it.

1370
01:57:36,668 --> 01:57:37,909
[SPEAKER_14]: Good luck to you, Loki.

1371
01:57:37,929 --> 01:57:38,749
[SPEAKER_14]: I hope it works out for you.

1372
01:57:38,769 --> 01:57:39,390
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that'll be fun.

1373
01:57:40,170 --> 01:57:40,470
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1374
01:57:42,312 --> 01:57:44,473
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, John's going all the way to the top.

1375
01:57:44,613 --> 01:57:45,014
[SPEAKER_14]: Look at that.

1376
01:57:46,394 --> 01:57:47,355
[SPEAKER_14]: That guy's crazy.

1377
01:57:47,675 --> 01:57:48,916
[SPEAKER_14]: That guy's your biggest fan.

1378
01:57:49,417 --> 01:57:49,977
[SPEAKER_14]: Look at that.

1379
01:57:50,857 --> 01:57:51,658
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki's turning red.

1380
01:57:52,078 --> 01:57:53,499
[SPEAKER_18]: I better change the subject.

1381
01:57:56,161 --> 01:57:56,641
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, Loki.

1382
01:57:58,142 --> 01:58:00,104
[SPEAKER_13]: We gotta get to actual news now.

1383
01:58:01,710 --> 01:58:04,591
[SPEAKER_13]: So we do all this fun stuff and then get back to some actual news.

1384
01:58:05,331 --> 01:58:09,732
[SPEAKER_13]: The full unlock list for 2DX Red has been released, actually.

1385
01:58:11,212 --> 01:58:15,113
[SPEAKER_13]: With some interesting information here, we've got all the hidden songs.

1386
01:58:15,373 --> 01:58:30,196
[SPEAKER_13]: So we have, you know, Egea by Ryu, Blox by Sparker, The Hope of Tomorrow by Sota, Earthscape by DJ Taka, Ultimate by Terra, Fake Time by DJ Rimocon,

1387
01:58:31,190 --> 01:58:38,234
[SPEAKER_13]: and Close My Eyes For Me by D.Crew featuring Dennis Gunn.

1388
01:58:40,935 --> 01:58:43,596
[SPEAKER_14]: That's two letters off from being the name of my boss.

1389
01:58:44,577 --> 01:58:46,578
[SPEAKER_14]: Seriously, that's scaring to me.

1390
01:58:46,658 --> 01:58:47,078
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, sorry.

1391
01:58:48,619 --> 01:58:54,262
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways, and also with Hidden and Others for Double A, Andromeda, and Gigadelic.

1392
01:58:55,928 --> 01:59:08,581
[SPEAKER_14]: I told Navi, and if you're out there listening, Navi, you poppin' music whore friend of mine and 2DX whore part-time, I told you when you said that there were not a whole lot of anothers in 2DX Red, I said, they're probably hidden.

1393
01:59:09,041 --> 01:59:11,003
[SPEAKER_14]: I told you so, I told you so, I told you so.

1394
01:59:11,324 --> 01:59:11,584
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1395
01:59:13,368 --> 01:59:22,841
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways, also should mention, since it's sort of Bomani related, exclusively through BomaniStyle.com, they're going to be releasing Slake's new album.

1396
01:59:23,602 --> 01:59:28,589
[SPEAKER_13]: And Slake, for those of you who might not know, is an old school Bomani artist.

1397
01:59:30,157 --> 01:59:45,441
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of the titles for these songs here, Past, Oriental, Mechanist, The Fading of Light, Justified, Rush, I Am a Clone, and looks like Astro... I can't even pronounce that.

1398
01:59:45,741 --> 01:59:47,182
[SPEAKER_13]: Astro-Oxy Remix.

1399
01:59:48,522 --> 01:59:50,363
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways, and those should be coming soon.

1400
01:59:50,383 --> 01:59:55,424
[SPEAKER_13]: They're doing some stupid little contests here where you get to design the cover and yadda yadda yadda.

1401
01:59:55,544 --> 01:59:57,625
[SPEAKER_13]: So go to my cell, check it out.

1402
02:00:00,236 --> 02:00:02,406
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's a little clip of Slake, if you're unfamiliar with Slake.

1403
02:00:02,426 --> 02:00:04,796
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's a little clip of cloudy music from 7thstyle.

1404
02:00:19,472 --> 02:00:22,673
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't know what exactly you would call Slake's style of music.

1405
02:00:22,713 --> 02:00:27,434
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just, it's funky beats, I think would be a good way of putting, classifying Slake.

1406
02:00:27,454 --> 02:00:28,634
[SPEAKER_14]: You can't really classify him.

1407
02:00:28,674 --> 02:00:31,055
[SPEAKER_14]: He's a pretty fun guy.

1408
02:00:33,196 --> 02:00:36,137
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, so, I don't know.

1409
02:00:36,357 --> 02:00:36,737
[SPEAKER_13]: But anyways.

1410
02:00:38,777 --> 02:00:41,019
[SPEAKER_13]: Huh, so I think that's pretty much all the news.

1411
02:00:41,119 --> 02:00:43,321
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, Poppin's 12, something happened with that.

1412
02:00:43,541 --> 02:00:43,862
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1413
02:00:43,882 --> 02:00:47,265
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a little piece of news I want to share going on.

1414
02:00:47,405 --> 02:00:52,950
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, this was posted to our site by our very own news guy, Dark Tetsuya, who does a lot of the news for the site.

1415
02:00:52,970 --> 02:00:55,452
[SPEAKER_14]: We really appreciate him helping out over at OrangeLaundry.com.

1416
02:00:55,872 --> 02:01:04,060
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if you guys remember this, but way back in the beginnings of the show, I'm talking like two years ago, back in the first like 10, 20 episodes, you guys remember Twin Galaxies?

1417
02:01:05,569 --> 02:01:08,010
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I noticed that that's back.

1418
02:01:08,170 --> 02:01:14,192
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, Twin Galaxies, now they are the site that does all the high scores for games, video games.

1419
02:01:14,232 --> 02:01:17,673
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not talking about just like new video games, I'm talking about old video games too.

1420
02:01:17,714 --> 02:01:22,875
[SPEAKER_14]: We actually, probably the last time we brought them up on the show was during Classic Gaming Expo earlier this year.

1421
02:01:22,955 --> 02:01:26,437
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember when we all participated in the Stampede Challenge?

1422
02:01:26,697 --> 02:01:30,558
[SPEAKER_14]: Which, by the way, I never checked to see if the scores were on, because I, are they?

1423
02:01:31,138 --> 02:01:32,139
[SPEAKER_13]: They were, and you did.

1424
02:01:32,219 --> 02:01:32,439
[SPEAKER_13]: Check.

1425
02:01:32,899 --> 02:01:34,619
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, okay, I don't remember.

1426
02:01:35,680 --> 02:01:39,260
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to have to pull that up again, because I remember that I was in the bottom three.

1427
02:01:39,300 --> 02:01:41,661
[SPEAKER_14]: I swear I did so horrible at Stampede.

1428
02:01:41,841 --> 02:01:46,542
[SPEAKER_13]: I was somewhere in the teens for the rankings for Gradius V also.

1429
02:01:47,462 --> 02:01:48,202
[SPEAKER_14]: Very, very nice.

1430
02:01:48,422 --> 02:01:53,823
[SPEAKER_14]: How does that make your internet penis feel, to be in the top 20 Gradius V players, officially?

1431
02:01:54,063 --> 02:01:56,804
[SPEAKER_13]: That's pretty sad, since I don't play Gradius.

1432
02:01:57,084 --> 02:02:01,105
[SPEAKER_13]: That was the first time I'd ever played Gradius V. That's not saying much.

1433
02:02:06,583 --> 02:02:08,186
[SPEAKER_14]: Twin Galaxies is back in the news.

1434
02:02:08,406 --> 02:02:11,913
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently, a brand new record has been set.

1435
02:02:13,703 --> 02:02:28,369
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm actually going to the link, which is a link actually to a post over on AaronInJapan.com And they actually, and if you want to see all this for yourself, it's all posted over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com They actually posted a story from Twin Galaxies, where apparently, what is the guy's name?

1436
02:02:28,729 --> 02:02:32,090
[SPEAKER_14]: Gregory Cantor of Pennsylvania in the U.S.

1437
02:02:32,130 --> 02:02:33,411
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, that's where I spent some time this year.

1438
02:02:34,872 --> 02:02:38,454
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, funny enough, I didn't see any good DDR machines while I was out there.

1439
02:02:38,534 --> 02:02:42,317
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently, I was checking all the wrong places, so it was my own damn fault.

1440
02:02:42,537 --> 02:02:48,942
[SPEAKER_14]: This guy in Pennsylvania has just set the new record for DDR Extreme.

1441
02:02:49,993 --> 02:02:54,495
[SPEAKER_14]: And basically the way the rules work, this is the way the official rules work for you to get ranked.

1442
02:02:54,856 --> 02:02:57,037
[SPEAKER_14]: You have to be playing on easy, difficulty 3.

1443
02:02:57,797 --> 02:02:59,058
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a 5 song set.

1444
02:02:59,578 --> 02:03:01,159
[SPEAKER_14]: Game over has to be turned on.

1445
02:03:01,779 --> 02:03:04,921
[SPEAKER_14]: You get to play your choice of songs, but you have to be on heavy mode.

1446
02:03:05,281 --> 02:03:09,423
[SPEAKER_14]: The gamer is allowed to take as much time in between sets as the timer allows.

1447
02:03:09,943 --> 02:03:13,445
[SPEAKER_14]: No song can be picked more than 2 times in the performance.

1448
02:03:13,925 --> 02:03:16,266
[SPEAKER_14]: The selection and sequence of songs is the player's choice.

1449
02:03:16,726 --> 02:03:19,166
[SPEAKER_14]: Player's hands may not touch the dance pad.

1450
02:03:19,606 --> 02:03:20,406
[SPEAKER_14]: Bar's okay though.

1451
02:03:20,827 --> 02:03:22,787
[SPEAKER_14]: Only the player's feet may touch the dance pad.

1452
02:03:22,807 --> 02:03:23,887
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is how the guy did it.

1453
02:03:24,187 --> 02:03:30,849
[SPEAKER_14]: He played Max 300, Max Unlimited, Sakura, Bag, Paranoia Rebirth.

1454
02:03:30,909 --> 02:03:32,929
[SPEAKER_14]: So basically he played every 10-footer in the game.

1455
02:03:33,269 --> 02:03:33,809
[SPEAKER_14]: Is Rebirth a 10?

1456
02:03:34,230 --> 02:03:34,710
[SPEAKER_14]: Or is Rebirth a 9?

1457
02:03:35,490 --> 02:03:37,450
[SPEAKER_14]: So he played... Are you sure?

1458
02:03:38,490 --> 02:03:40,351
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, so he played four 10s and a 9.

1459
02:03:42,409 --> 02:03:49,639
[SPEAKER_14]: And he ended up with a, what would they, actually, if you read on in the thread, they don't think it's Suguru, they think it's actually Sakura, not Suguru.

1460
02:03:49,840 --> 02:03:52,604
[SPEAKER_14]: Which would make more sense anyway, for somebody to pick Sakura, because it's a 10.

1461
02:03:53,084 --> 02:03:54,526
[SPEAKER_14]: So this guy got a score of 375,311,150 points.

1462
02:03:57,711 --> 02:03:57,791
[SPEAKER_14]: YASU

1463
02:04:13,388 --> 02:04:24,277
[SPEAKER_14]: If I'm not mistaking, didn't he, remember when we first brought this up on the show, it was some other guy who had a really, really low record, we were all making fun of how we were going to beat it, and then Yasu came in and kicked all our asses, basically.

1464
02:04:24,718 --> 02:04:26,079
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's why this is such big news.

1465
02:04:26,359 --> 02:04:32,084
[SPEAKER_14]: If, if, I recall, and I may be wrong, but, because maybe it's a Max 2 versus Extreme thing, I don't know.

1466
02:04:32,364 --> 02:04:33,505
[SPEAKER_14]: You know any more about this, Loki?

1467
02:04:34,666 --> 02:04:39,991
[SPEAKER_13]: That was Max 2, if I remember correctly, and the rules were different than, I think, the rules where you can't play a song more than twice.

1468
02:04:41,119 --> 02:04:42,820
[SPEAKER_13]: in a row, or twice, I think.

1469
02:04:43,301 --> 02:04:46,422
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I think he played Max Unlimited twice or something like that.

1470
02:04:46,582 --> 02:04:46,883
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1471
02:04:47,403 --> 02:04:48,083
[SPEAKER_13]: It was stupid.

1472
02:04:48,223 --> 02:04:49,504
[SPEAKER_13]: Twin Galaxies is stupid.

1473
02:04:49,604 --> 02:04:50,325
[SPEAKER_13]: I really don't care.

1474
02:04:52,186 --> 02:04:52,946
[SPEAKER_13]: That's my take on it.

1475
02:04:56,568 --> 02:04:57,309
[SPEAKER_14]: Very interesting.

1476
02:04:59,901 --> 02:05:05,484
[SPEAKER_14]: And now I'm getting a message in our chatroom over at www.orangelandredo.com from Dark Tetsuya.

1477
02:05:06,044 --> 02:05:10,626
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, sorry guys, it was Take, not Yasu, that set the bar there, sorry.

1478
02:05:11,126 --> 02:05:11,667
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what?

1479
02:05:12,347 --> 02:05:18,370
[SPEAKER_14]: Both of them are insanely good at DDR, it's easy to get them confused because you always hear about them together.

1480
02:05:18,410 --> 02:05:20,131
[SPEAKER_14]: You always hear about the two of them, so sorry about that.

1481
02:05:20,331 --> 02:05:21,071
[SPEAKER_14]: My bad, my bad.

1482
02:05:22,472 --> 02:05:27,014
[SPEAKER_14]: But Dark Tetsuya says, it seems like he may not have gotten parental permission.

1483
02:05:28,667 --> 02:05:31,789
[SPEAKER_14]: I certainly didn't have parental permission when I played Stampede.

1484
02:05:34,290 --> 02:05:35,991
[SPEAKER_14]: My mother doesn't know I do this garbage.

1485
02:05:36,111 --> 02:05:36,472
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

1486
02:05:36,832 --> 02:05:40,053
[SPEAKER_14]: You have to have parental permission to be on a high score list?

1487
02:05:40,133 --> 02:05:42,034
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that what they're trying to say?

1488
02:05:42,195 --> 02:05:43,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Something about child privacy law.

1489
02:05:44,836 --> 02:05:45,436
[SPEAKER_14]: Jeez.

1490
02:05:48,038 --> 02:05:48,698
[SPEAKER_14]: That's kind of lame.

1491
02:05:49,458 --> 02:05:50,579
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, but I think that's lame.

1492
02:05:52,475 --> 02:05:53,756
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, we're going to go to our break, guys.

1493
02:05:53,776 --> 02:05:56,557
[SPEAKER_14]: So when we come back from this break, we're going to get into the FUs of the week.

1494
02:05:57,177 --> 02:06:01,039
[SPEAKER_14]: Because we have to do that segment every week because we're just angsty.

1495
02:06:01,059 --> 02:06:02,139
[SPEAKER_14]: We're angsty, angsty people.

1496
02:06:02,620 --> 02:06:03,440
[SPEAKER_14]: And we have to get it out.

1497
02:06:04,040 --> 02:06:07,142
[SPEAKER_14]: In this break, we're going to hear... I don't know.

1498
02:06:07,162 --> 02:06:08,502
[SPEAKER_14]: What are you in the mood for, Jamie?

1499
02:06:08,522 --> 02:06:10,243
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you want to hear this break?

1500
02:06:10,863 --> 02:06:14,325
[SPEAKER_02]: How about Dance Maniac stuff?

1501
02:06:14,685 --> 02:06:16,346
[SPEAKER_14]: Ooh, sounds like a plan to me.

1502
02:06:16,446 --> 02:06:17,547
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's do some Dance Maniac songs.

1503
02:06:17,567 --> 02:06:18,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Jay Paradise stuff.

1504
02:06:19,367 --> 02:06:20,548
[SPEAKER_14]: If I can find some, we'll do that.

1505
02:06:23,297 --> 02:06:23,517
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1506
02:06:24,877 --> 02:06:25,157
[SPEAKER_14]: Nothing.

1507
02:06:25,577 --> 02:06:26,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1508
02:06:26,658 --> 02:06:28,438
[SPEAKER_02]: How about, okay, better yet.

1509
02:06:29,438 --> 02:06:34,499
[SPEAKER_02]: I request... Hurry up.

1510
02:06:34,559 --> 02:06:35,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Sensation.

1511
02:06:36,339 --> 02:06:37,419
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, if I can find it.

1512
02:06:37,679 --> 02:06:39,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1513
02:06:40,640 --> 02:06:41,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Twinbee.

1514
02:06:42,240 --> 02:06:42,540
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1515
02:06:43,560 --> 02:06:46,161
[SPEAKER_02]: And Gradius Full Speed.

1516
02:06:46,841 --> 02:06:47,961
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, we'll make that happen.

1517
02:06:48,001 --> 02:06:52,422
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll be right back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

1518
02:08:35,539 --> 02:08:36,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

1519
02:09:08,018 --> 02:09:09,819
Thank you for watching!

1520
02:11:33,667 --> 02:11:34,648
Thanks for watching!

1521
02:11:58,191 --> 02:12:06,779
[SPEAKER_01]: Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.

1522
02:12:06,819 --> 02:12:12,345
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

1523
02:12:13,140 --> 02:12:16,123
[SPEAKER_14]: I saw the precious precious sitting back in the tech room today

1524
02:12:34,261 --> 02:12:37,707
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a nice, pretty little 2DX machine missing the monitor because they're replacing it.

1525
02:12:38,067 --> 02:12:41,112
[SPEAKER_14]: It's currently in 8th style, but who knows what it'll be when it's up and running.

1526
02:12:41,493 --> 02:12:46,801
[SPEAKER_14]: I smooched it to tell it I love it, and yes, I humped it too, just like I did the Scandia 8th style when it first came in.

1527
02:12:46,841 --> 02:12:47,963
[SPEAKER_14]: That's so good to know now.

1528
02:12:49,963 --> 02:12:50,503
[SPEAKER_14]: So there it is.

1529
02:12:50,883 --> 02:12:52,684
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got wifey poo humping on it.

1530
02:12:53,404 --> 02:12:53,784
[SPEAKER_14]: Great.

1531
02:12:53,844 --> 02:12:54,385
[SPEAKER_02]: That's happy.

1532
02:12:54,425 --> 02:12:56,545
[SPEAKER_14]: Girl cooties on the 2DX machine.

1533
02:12:57,526 --> 02:12:57,946
[SPEAKER_14]: Just kidding.

1534
02:12:58,266 --> 02:12:59,427
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes it all the better.

1535
02:13:00,987 --> 02:13:01,927
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's pretty exciting.

1536
02:13:01,968 --> 02:13:02,388
[SPEAKER_14]: So there it is.

1537
02:13:02,768 --> 02:13:05,389
[SPEAKER_14]: That's about as close to a confirmation as you can get.

1538
02:13:05,469 --> 02:13:08,530
[SPEAKER_14]: When Iguana Girls humped it, you know it's the real deal.

1539
02:13:10,111 --> 02:13:10,411
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

1540
02:13:12,351 --> 02:13:16,333
[SPEAKER_14]: So anyway, moving right along, I guess we're going to get into the FUs of the week.

1541
02:13:17,935 --> 02:13:19,136
[SPEAKER_14]: We're not going to take it anymore.

1542
02:13:19,176 --> 02:13:19,496
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, this is bad.

1543
02:13:51,287 --> 02:13:52,268
[SPEAKER_02]: A big F.U.

1544
02:13:52,308 --> 02:13:55,851
[SPEAKER_02]: toward my overwhelming lack of free time the past week.

1545
02:13:55,911 --> 02:14:01,436
[SPEAKER_02]: However, now that this semester is over and I have one thing left to do, it's great.

1546
02:14:01,456 --> 02:14:08,883
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I just realized that the classes that I need to take next semester are full term, except for one that's going to be second half.

1547
02:14:10,117 --> 02:14:12,982
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to be really freaking busy next semester.

1548
02:14:15,005 --> 02:14:24,039
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to there being no time off allowed next month, but I might have to beg some anyway to take care of some school stuff.

1549
02:14:26,992 --> 02:14:30,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Just an FU toward all the slow ass people on the road today.

1550
02:14:31,295 --> 02:14:38,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, and an FU toward the guy who cut me off in traffic and then threw on his brakes on purpose.

1551
02:14:38,779 --> 02:14:41,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Because he was tailgating me so I slowed down.

1552
02:14:41,661 --> 02:14:46,143
[SPEAKER_02]: So he goes around me and then gets in front of me and tries to throw on his brakes so that I went into him.

1553
02:14:46,524 --> 02:14:48,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Thing is, I drive a Tercel with bad brakes.

1554
02:14:49,165 --> 02:14:49,625
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going 50.

1555
02:14:50,646 --> 02:14:52,706
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that would have been, like, lethal.

1556
02:14:53,046 --> 02:14:58,708
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I, luckily there was no one in the next instance, so I swerved around him, and it turns out that I ended up being, like, five cars ahead of him in traffic anyway.

1557
02:14:59,288 --> 02:15:02,728
[SPEAKER_02]: So, he got stuck behind, like, some old people in a Buick.

1558
02:15:04,729 --> 02:15:13,210
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, F you toward, uh, not having money, time, and certain things.

1559
02:15:15,651 --> 02:15:17,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's really about it.

1560
02:15:19,764 --> 02:15:24,787
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to point out for a minute, if any of the OC Remix people are listening, this is another one by Loki.

1561
02:15:30,351 --> 02:15:31,091
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to get you.

1562
02:15:31,111 --> 02:15:34,253
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to get you to whore yourself out.

1563
02:15:34,293 --> 02:15:35,854
[SPEAKER_14]: If you won't do it, dammit, we will.

1564
02:15:38,195 --> 02:15:39,816
[SPEAKER_14]: And on that note, let's go over to Loki.

1565
02:15:43,459 --> 02:15:45,420
[SPEAKER_13]: Whatever, I don't even care anymore.

1566
02:15:46,092 --> 02:15:48,094
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck you to my work for making me bake cookies.

1567
02:15:48,474 --> 02:15:51,036
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't like extracurricular activities no matter what they are.

1568
02:15:51,316 --> 02:15:52,457
[SPEAKER_13]: Even if it involves cookies.

1569
02:15:52,537 --> 02:15:54,898
[SPEAKER_13]: Because the cookies I made, I don't like to eat.

1570
02:15:55,239 --> 02:15:56,279
[SPEAKER_13]: One, because they taste like lemon.

1571
02:15:56,320 --> 02:15:58,241
[SPEAKER_13]: Two, because they have nuts in them.

1572
02:15:58,441 --> 02:15:59,462
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not my forte.

1573
02:15:59,722 --> 02:16:00,022
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways.

1574
02:16:01,243 --> 02:16:05,326
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, I guess fuck you, uh, CarMax for taking forever to fix my car.

1575
02:16:05,426 --> 02:16:09,149
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't know, but I guess it takes two days to do a fucking brake job.

1576
02:16:09,789 --> 02:16:10,990
[SPEAKER_13]: Whoa, what have I been doing?

1577
02:16:11,010 --> 02:16:14,613
[SPEAKER_13]: I must have been doing it completely wrong because I get mine done in like an hour and a half.

1578
02:16:15,182 --> 02:16:19,143
[SPEAKER_13]: The only problem is I didn't know I needed a brake job, because I didn't know what the fuck was wrong with my brake.

1579
02:16:19,524 --> 02:16:38,570
[SPEAKER_13]: Come to find out, it was actually something when the person before me, or CarMax, who fucking knows, installed my brakes, they installed them incorrectly, so the retainer clip was broken, and thus the pad was wearing funny, causing a vibration noise, thus resulting in my brake being worn down on one side, not the other side, so I needed the front brake job.

1580
02:16:39,111 --> 02:16:39,851
[SPEAKER_13]: But, unfortunately...

1581
02:16:40,219 --> 02:16:42,480
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll have to do a front break job later, because I got done now.

1582
02:16:42,840 --> 02:16:43,961
[SPEAKER_13]: So, good for that.

1583
02:16:44,761 --> 02:16:54,546
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, and then finally, um, since I don't really have that many FUs this week, um, fuck you to, uh, let's see here.

1584
02:16:55,086 --> 02:17:00,549
[SPEAKER_13]: I know it's coming here, coming, coming, um, no, I can't think of what it was.

1585
02:17:01,110 --> 02:17:05,352
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, there's something that was really pissing me off the other day, but I just cannot remember what it is right now.

1586
02:17:05,672 --> 02:17:05,792
[SPEAKER_13]: Um,

1587
02:17:08,075 --> 02:17:09,516
[SPEAKER_13]: All things just keep getting better

1588
02:17:36,591 --> 02:17:39,013
[SPEAKER_14]: F you to the fog, because fog is scary.

1589
02:17:39,393 --> 02:17:42,116
[SPEAKER_14]: And I don't like driving in the fog, because it's very scary.

1590
02:17:43,297 --> 02:17:43,497
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1591
02:17:43,737 --> 02:17:46,420
[SPEAKER_02]: We saw a six-car accident in the fog yesterday.

1592
02:17:46,440 --> 02:17:48,222
[SPEAKER_02]: See, the fog is scary.

1593
02:17:49,122 --> 02:17:52,866
[SPEAKER_14]: Fog is a cruel trick to be playing on us humans, so I say F you to fog.

1594
02:17:53,446 --> 02:17:55,008
[SPEAKER_14]: And F you to angst.

1595
02:17:58,451 --> 02:18:06,654
[SPEAKER_14]: and F you to the fact that I wasn't drinking last night even though for once I was the person that didn't have to drive so I could have drank all I wanted but I didn't because I'm a pussy.

1596
02:18:07,495 --> 02:18:13,297
[SPEAKER_14]: And F you to complicated situations because I keep finding myself in them and I hate that.

1597
02:18:15,398 --> 02:18:16,578
[SPEAKER_14]: Fair enough?

1598
02:18:16,639 --> 02:18:18,879
[SPEAKER_18]: I was going to add something on the fog thing.

1599
02:18:20,040 --> 02:18:20,240
[SPEAKER_14]: What?

1600
02:18:20,260 --> 02:18:24,902
[SPEAKER_18]: A dude in a Mustang broke through one of our neighbor's fences.

1601
02:18:26,138 --> 02:18:28,959
[SPEAKER_00]: F-Fog Actually, I do have to say one thing about Fog, if I may

1602
02:18:51,289 --> 02:18:58,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, when I lived in Alabama, in college, at our dorms there was like this little grove of trees and it would get so foggy they would play hide and seek in the fog.

1603
02:18:58,996 --> 02:18:59,536
[SPEAKER_02]: That, oh.

1604
02:19:00,097 --> 02:19:00,777
[SPEAKER_02]: That was really cool.

1605
02:19:00,877 --> 02:19:03,860
[SPEAKER_14]: I would be so afraid of getting raped by a zombie in the fog.

1606
02:19:04,901 --> 02:19:06,883
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the days before Silent Hill.

1607
02:19:07,243 --> 02:19:07,783
[SPEAKER_00]: Still!

1608
02:19:08,644 --> 02:19:11,306
[SPEAKER_14]: Zombie raping has been around forever.

1609
02:19:11,907 --> 02:19:15,190
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that would explain a few people who call where I work.

1610
02:19:15,410 --> 02:19:15,770
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

1611
02:19:16,851 --> 02:19:17,592
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's move on.

1612
02:19:17,772 --> 02:19:18,713
[SPEAKER_14]: Angel, your FUs.

1613
02:19:19,361 --> 02:19:25,706
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, yeah, I'll add another F you to the difficult situation thing, just because I hate that.

1614
02:19:26,886 --> 02:19:33,671
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, F you to, um, yeah.

1615
02:19:33,691 --> 02:19:37,774
[SPEAKER_18]: F you to a parent that wants to be there but never was to begin with.

1616
02:19:38,275 --> 02:19:44,819
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not talking about my parents, I'm talking about my significant other's certain parents.

1617
02:19:45,700 --> 02:19:47,221
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, and, uh, you know what?

1618
02:19:47,970 --> 02:19:51,473
[SPEAKER_18]: They don't want you there, so stop trying, because you never tried anyway.

1619
02:19:52,473 --> 02:19:53,934
[SPEAKER_18]: And, uh, that's it.

1620
02:19:55,275 --> 02:19:55,576
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

1621
02:19:56,756 --> 02:19:59,018
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's go on to the chatroom FUs, then.

1622
02:20:00,259 --> 02:20:04,502
[SPEAKER_14]: Dork says, F you to myself for having a girl over and not doing anything about it.

1623
02:20:06,484 --> 02:20:06,784
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, exactly.

1624
02:20:06,804 --> 02:20:07,224
[SPEAKER_14]: What, Loki?

1625
02:20:08,225 --> 02:20:08,865
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, exactly.

1626
02:20:08,905 --> 02:20:11,207
[SPEAKER_13]: That stuff will kick you until the day you die.

1627
02:20:11,507 --> 02:20:11,807
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay?

1628
02:20:12,048 --> 02:20:15,070
[SPEAKER_13]: Just, you gotta remember, do it even if it seems wrong.

1629
02:20:17,520 --> 02:20:18,501
[SPEAKER_14]: Get the zombies to help.

1630
02:20:19,122 --> 02:20:32,680
[SPEAKER_14]: Dark Knight says, My FU goes to the greedy American cable company, sounding like an English-speaking Japanese guy, for trying to make you spend more money by removing HBO and Cinemax from basic and just putting on digital cable only now.

1631
02:20:33,441 --> 02:20:33,642
[SPEAKER_14]: Hmm.

1632
02:20:35,931 --> 02:20:42,900
[SPEAKER_14]: EvilMauki2DX says, F you to DarkLionXVI for pointing out that Noria has crooked teeth and needs braces.

1633
02:20:43,321 --> 02:20:45,924
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll never be able to look at her the same ever again.

1634
02:20:46,345 --> 02:20:48,107
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know how you didn't notice that before.

1635
02:20:48,227 --> 02:20:48,668
[SPEAKER_14]: You're weird.

1636
02:20:49,409 --> 02:20:52,192
[SPEAKER_14]: And one more F you to whatever caused the station drops earlier.

1637
02:20:52,313 --> 02:20:52,753
[SPEAKER_14]: I agree.

1638
02:20:52,833 --> 02:20:53,214
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1639
02:20:53,374 --> 02:20:53,835
[SPEAKER_14]: That was evil.

1640
02:20:55,267 --> 02:21:00,828
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkLionXVI says, F you to Nathan Gale for killing metal guitar legend Dimebag Daryl.

1641
02:21:01,928 --> 02:21:02,988
[SPEAKER_14]: Double amen to that.

1642
02:21:03,348 --> 02:21:05,309
[SPEAKER_14]: And four other fans in Columbus, Ohio.

1643
02:21:05,669 --> 02:21:07,669
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm glad the police officer killed the bastard.

1644
02:21:07,729 --> 02:21:08,749
[SPEAKER_14]: Nathan, I hope you're comfortable.

1645
02:21:08,789 --> 02:21:09,350
[SPEAKER_14]: Stay in hell.

1646
02:21:09,730 --> 02:21:11,110
[SPEAKER_14]: Rest in peace, Dimebag Daryl.

1647
02:21:11,670 --> 02:21:14,711
[SPEAKER_14]: We in the metal world will miss your red goatee and intense guitar riffs.

1648
02:21:15,391 --> 02:21:20,932
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, and F you to EvilNauki2DX for torturing me with Nico Mimi Mode, the opening theme for...

1649
02:21:22,745 --> 02:21:24,647
[SPEAKER_14]: You just had to do this to the white guy, didn't you?

1650
02:21:25,067 --> 02:21:46,685
[SPEAKER_14]: Sukyomi Moonphase John Fields says, F you to the asshole who caused the pipe upstairs to burst My dorm room is flooded, oh you are sued, oh you are so sued You ruined my stuff and it's finals week F you to the school as well for not keeping the maintenance on the pipes in this dorm You're sued as well if there isn't any compensation coming to me

1651
02:21:49,389 --> 02:21:55,712
[SPEAKER_14]: Illusion says, F you to waking up at 4.30 in the morning because of a nightmare of some weird guy strangling a woman with floss.

1652
02:21:57,052 --> 02:21:59,593
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh well, it led to my new short story being written.

1653
02:22:00,054 --> 02:22:03,375
[SPEAKER_14]: F you to this stupid character analysis paper for the Scarlet Letter due tomorrow.

1654
02:22:03,655 --> 02:22:08,277
[SPEAKER_14]: And finally, a kind F you to DDR Angel for making that crappy bitch song win the cage match.

1655
02:22:08,697 --> 02:22:10,718
[SPEAKER_14]: Sarah McLachlan was clearly the best song.

1656
02:22:11,098 --> 02:22:12,999
[SPEAKER_14]: But it was a kind F you, DDR Angel.

1657
02:22:14,560 --> 02:22:17,261
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't say anything because I don't know him, so whatever.

1658
02:22:17,762 --> 02:22:20,363
[SPEAKER_18]: and besides, they left the decision up to me anyway.

1659
02:22:20,383 --> 02:22:21,523
[SPEAKER_14]: That's right, you tell them.

1660
02:22:25,285 --> 02:22:29,847
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, Misty says, F the movie theater that is one of only two in the group of machines in St.

1661
02:22:29,887 --> 02:22:32,047
[SPEAKER_14]: Louis for not having the machine on tonight.

1662
02:22:32,128 --> 02:22:34,228
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd rather play on shitty pads than not at all.

1663
02:22:34,729 --> 02:22:39,010
[SPEAKER_14]: Nice to see you finally give a damn about the machine's maintenance though and of course, F the cage match.

1664
02:22:39,870 --> 02:22:40,411
[SPEAKER_14]: You're welcome.

1665
02:22:41,631 --> 02:22:46,353
[SPEAKER_14]: Jaded2004 says, F you to a broken rib which equals no DDR for a month.

1666
02:22:48,154 --> 02:22:53,196
[SPEAKER_14]: Sigurd says, F you to a certain friend and his brother for not coming to terms with each of their sexuality.

1667
02:22:53,577 --> 02:22:55,077
[SPEAKER_14]: They can make such a hot porn.

1668
02:22:55,137 --> 02:22:55,498
[SPEAKER_14]: Grr.

1669
02:22:56,378 --> 02:22:58,219
[SPEAKER_14]: F you to not having WarioWare DS.

1670
02:22:58,559 --> 02:23:00,780
[SPEAKER_14]: Played my friend's copy and it's the best game ever.

1671
02:23:01,040 --> 02:23:02,041
[SPEAKER_14]: Wait, when did that come out?

1672
02:23:02,101 --> 02:23:03,561
[SPEAKER_14]: WarioWare DS is not out.

1673
02:23:03,701 --> 02:23:03,962
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1674
02:23:04,342 --> 02:23:07,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Um... Not that I know of.

1675
02:23:07,883 --> 02:23:08,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe in Japan?

1676
02:23:09,224 --> 02:23:09,624
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe.

1677
02:23:09,664 --> 02:23:10,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe in Japan.

1678
02:23:10,885 --> 02:23:11,865
[SPEAKER_14]: Details, please.

1679
02:23:14,006 --> 02:23:14,887
[SPEAKER_13]: It might be out in Japan.

1680
02:23:15,782 --> 02:23:17,723
[SPEAKER_14]: Finally, F you to not getting enough sleep.

1681
02:23:17,824 --> 02:23:19,205
[SPEAKER_14]: Damn you, Final Fantasy XI.

1682
02:23:19,245 --> 02:23:20,826
[SPEAKER_14]: It's all your fault.

1683
02:23:22,367 --> 02:23:23,187
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, moving on.

1684
02:23:24,348 --> 02:23:25,109
[SPEAKER_14]: What, DarkSakura?

1685
02:23:25,729 --> 02:23:26,530
[SPEAKER_14]: I smell vanilla.

1686
02:23:27,651 --> 02:23:29,092
[SPEAKER_02]: All of a sudden, I smell vanilla.

1687
02:23:30,873 --> 02:23:34,055
[SPEAKER_14]: Blarg says F you to people who keep saying they're bored all the time.

1688
02:23:34,115 --> 02:23:36,237
[SPEAKER_14]: It pisses off people who don't have time to do anything.

1689
02:23:36,597 --> 02:23:40,340
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're bored, go read some books and stop telling everyone you have nothing to do.

1690
02:23:44,728 --> 02:23:48,313
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, they said in the chat room it's the Japanese version of WarioWare DS.

1691
02:23:48,894 --> 02:23:49,975
[SPEAKER_14]: Just confirmation there.

1692
02:23:52,358 --> 02:23:54,461
[SPEAKER_14]: And DarkTetsuya says, F you to my dance pad.

1693
02:23:54,501 --> 02:23:58,487
[SPEAKER_14]: It might be broken, so I'm having a harder time passing Mission 19 on Extreme US.

1694
02:23:59,147 --> 02:23:59,288
[SPEAKER_14]: Dope.

1695
02:24:00,342 --> 02:24:03,545
[SPEAKER_14]: Legend of Zaku says, F you to having to go through the hell called finals week.

1696
02:24:03,705 --> 02:24:07,488
[SPEAKER_14]: F you to lacking the basic skills of Java programming when I really need them.

1697
02:24:09,049 --> 02:24:22,761
[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh, Rayum, I hope I said that, I hope, yeah, because if it was Ryum it would be an I, so Rayum says, F you to all the freaking extra hours that I have to put in before January 1st to compensate for the hours I put for my master's class.

1698
02:24:23,241 --> 02:24:25,283
[SPEAKER_14]: Extra work hours, that means, sorry.

1699
02:24:26,661 --> 02:24:28,562
[SPEAKER_14]: and Jazz says, F you to Saturday.

1700
02:24:28,622 --> 02:24:30,222
[SPEAKER_14]: Holy crap, what a horrible day you were.

1701
02:24:30,322 --> 02:24:36,724
[SPEAKER_14]: I had my first online final at 9 o'clock in the morning, so I got up early and went to school around 7 so I could get food and study.

1702
02:24:37,065 --> 02:24:40,306
[SPEAKER_14]: During this process, I locked my keys in my car and need to call AAA.

1703
02:24:40,666 --> 02:24:43,567
[SPEAKER_14]: I would have just called my parents, but they were conveniently in Reno for the weekend.

1704
02:24:43,947 --> 02:24:49,409
[SPEAKER_14]: After that, I completely botched my final and proceeded to go home and drown my sorrows in sleep in World of Warcraft.

1705
02:24:50,989 --> 02:24:52,410
[SPEAKER_14]: And after that, it got cut off, but...

1706
02:24:53,427 --> 02:24:56,049
[SPEAKER_14]: If it has to do with World of Warcraft, I don't want to hear about it anyway.

1707
02:24:56,629 --> 02:24:57,950
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm a little bitter towards that game.

1708
02:24:58,210 --> 02:24:59,051
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sure it's a great game.

1709
02:24:59,091 --> 02:25:00,052
[SPEAKER_14]: I've heard a lot of good things about it.

1710
02:25:00,072 --> 02:25:01,253
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just a little bitter about it, that's all.

1711
02:25:03,534 --> 02:25:04,135
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, that's it.

1712
02:25:04,795 --> 02:25:06,076
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking at the Nevada girl.

1713
02:25:06,657 --> 02:25:10,359
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is the link you had me post in the chat room earlier during the last podcast.

1714
02:25:10,459 --> 02:25:17,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's an 11-year-old that killed a 12-year-old in her class in Japan, and now she's like an internet celebrity.

1715
02:25:19,626 --> 02:25:21,127
[SPEAKER_02]: And they call her the Nevada girl.

1716
02:25:21,327 --> 02:25:22,348
[SPEAKER_14]: I've heard of this girl.

1717
02:25:23,055 --> 02:25:25,117
[SPEAKER_02]: or sometimes Tan-chan, I guess.

1718
02:25:25,357 --> 02:25:26,118
[SPEAKER_14]: What happened to her?

1719
02:25:26,758 --> 02:25:33,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they can't really do anything to her because the age of criminal responsibility in Japan is 14, which actually was lowered from 16.

1720
02:25:34,048 --> 02:25:36,170
[SPEAKER_14]: Wait, so when you kill somebody and you're 11?

1721
02:25:36,350 --> 02:25:38,992
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're under 14, you can't be prosecuted.

1722
02:25:39,012 --> 02:25:42,075
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're still trying to decide what to do with her.

1723
02:25:44,977 --> 02:25:49,781
[SPEAKER_02]: But apparently she's a big internet celebrity now in Japan and there's all kinds of fan art about her.

1724
02:25:51,943 --> 02:25:55,786
[SPEAKER_02]: I did post the links in my live journal including a bunch of the fan art.

1725
02:25:57,047 --> 02:26:13,221
[SPEAKER_02]: This site, and if someone will just retype this for me, it's www.shrinemaden.com slash, and it's all in caps, Nevada underscore, and then capital A, the rest is lowercase, RTWORK.

1726
02:26:13,862 --> 02:26:14,783
[SPEAKER_14]: I lost you, sorry.

1727
02:26:16,827 --> 02:26:33,474
[SPEAKER_02]: www.shrinemaden.com, Nevada is all capitalized, underscore, Nevada, okay, underscore, and then artwork, capital A, the rest is lowercase.

1728
02:26:34,354 --> 02:26:34,854
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the site.

1729
02:26:34,914 --> 02:26:35,694
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it?

1730
02:26:35,714 --> 02:26:36,435
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all the fan art.

1731
02:26:39,316 --> 02:26:41,517
[SPEAKER_14]: There it is, in the chat room, just for you guys.

1732
02:26:46,245 --> 02:26:48,526
[SPEAKER_14]: Some suggestions from the chatroom.

1733
02:26:48,566 --> 02:26:50,927
[SPEAKER_14]: Dark Knight says, here's a suggestion, send her to her shrink.

1734
02:26:51,947 --> 02:26:54,107
[SPEAKER_14]: Ram says the girl needs counseling big time.

1735
02:26:56,068 --> 02:26:56,508
[SPEAKER_14]: There you go.

1736
02:26:58,028 --> 02:26:59,569
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently she killed her with a box cutter.

1737
02:27:01,289 --> 02:27:03,290
[SPEAKER_14]: Hope you have a pleasant Sunday night, everybody.

1738
02:27:04,190 --> 02:27:07,491
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just find it funny that there's all kinds, like, look at one of these, Rob.

1739
02:27:08,365 --> 02:27:09,106
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I'm looking.

1740
02:27:09,926 --> 02:27:10,086
What?

1741
02:27:10,647 --> 02:27:13,049
[SPEAKER_14]: She looks so sweet and innocent.

1742
02:27:13,089 --> 02:27:14,930
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I'm gonna hold up my laptop to the thing.

1743
02:27:15,471 --> 02:27:20,014
[SPEAKER_14]: She looks sweet and innocent and chibi in that picture, and she's holding a little box cutter behind her back.

1744
02:27:20,074 --> 02:27:22,116
[SPEAKER_14]: That is, that's disturbing!

1745
02:27:22,816 --> 02:27:24,518
[SPEAKER_14]: That is downright scary!

1746
02:27:24,538 --> 02:27:25,999
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh my god.

1747
02:27:26,039 --> 02:27:27,160
[SPEAKER_14]: Ugh.

1748
02:27:28,561 --> 02:27:30,222
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, why do you find that so damn funny?

1749
02:27:31,443 --> 02:27:33,845
[SPEAKER_13]: Because she has a box cutter and she killed a kid.

1750
02:27:35,086 --> 02:27:36,287
[SPEAKER_13]: And now she's a fan.

1751
02:27:37,867 --> 02:27:45,992
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, well, at least she's not like the ugly red-headed kid that killed some stupid kid and proposed his body in like, uh, he was on, uh, 48 hours last night.

1752
02:27:47,533 --> 02:27:49,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, it's up on the webcam now.

1753
02:27:52,256 --> 02:27:58,559
[SPEAKER_14]: And the webcam, of course, is available over at www.orangeloungeradio.com And people are going to see my UberLeak Precious.

1754
02:27:59,300 --> 02:27:59,780
[SPEAKER_02]: My laptop.

1755
02:28:01,601 --> 02:28:05,264
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, uh, we're going to go to a break and when we come back, why don't we do some Ask Orange Lounge?

1756
02:28:05,284 --> 02:28:05,804
[SPEAKER_14]: How's that sound?

1757
02:28:07,299 --> 02:28:08,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we call you Rapcon?

1758
02:30:00,908 --> 02:30:02,790
Look around, look at what you see

1759
02:32:00,993 --> 02:32:02,174
Thanks for watching!

1760
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:29,540
Thanks for watching!

1761
02:33:37,270 --> 02:33:38,531
[SPEAKER_14]: Orange Lounge Radio.

1762
02:33:38,851 --> 02:33:41,013
[SPEAKER_14]: We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.

1763
02:33:46,457 --> 02:33:47,918
[SPEAKER_14]: My god, you people are scary.

1764
02:33:48,198 --> 02:33:50,920
[SPEAKER_14]: Looking at that cosplay and doujinshi.

1765
02:33:50,960 --> 02:33:52,641
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to cosplay her at Faname.

1766
02:33:53,602 --> 02:33:55,083
[SPEAKER_14]: She's 11 years old.

1767
02:33:56,123 --> 02:33:59,366
[SPEAKER_14]: What's this talk of cartoon vagina in the chatroom?

1768
02:33:59,606 --> 02:34:02,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the pictures are of the more hentai nature.

1769
02:34:02,908 --> 02:34:03,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Gross!

1770
02:34:03,468 --> 02:34:03,689
[SPEAKER_02]: But...

1771
02:34:04,622 --> 02:34:07,524
[SPEAKER_14]: God, as if I didn't have reason enough to be gay.

1772
02:34:07,724 --> 02:34:08,485
[SPEAKER_14]: Honestly, people.

1773
02:34:09,005 --> 02:34:14,109
[SPEAKER_02]: But some of the pictures are just so adorable, and it's so wrong that there's this whole fandom.

1774
02:34:14,149 --> 02:34:16,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the hentai one.

1775
02:34:16,990 --> 02:34:19,392
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm planning on cosplaying in Mockery of the Fandom.

1776
02:34:19,952 --> 02:34:20,233
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1777
02:34:21,514 --> 02:34:21,874
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure.

1778
02:34:23,095 --> 02:34:24,756
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just got an email from Middyhead.

1779
02:34:24,776 --> 02:34:29,019
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently his broadcast went pretty good, but he didn't get a chance to record it.

1780
02:34:29,399 --> 02:34:31,660
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess he was having technical difficulties right up until the last minute.

1781
02:34:31,921 --> 02:34:33,642
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, just like this show, what do you know?

1782
02:34:35,049 --> 02:34:36,329
[SPEAKER_14]: Ask Orange Lounge Ask Orange Lounge

1783
02:35:10,732 --> 02:35:13,674
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

1784
02:35:14,194 --> 02:35:17,416
[SPEAKER_14]: What will we find out tonight on Orange Lounge Radio?

1785
02:35:18,217 --> 02:35:25,541
[SPEAKER_14]: All I know is that I hope that the station doesn't disconnect, because if it does, then we won't be having this segment again tonight.

1786
02:35:32,725 --> 02:35:35,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, there's a picture of her as one of the Battle Royale girls.

1787
02:35:36,405 --> 02:35:46,869
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, and Jazz is the first question tonight, and he's basically asking the same thing we were just talking about, saying, Why is there a Nevada vagina action?

1788
02:35:47,629 --> 02:35:50,370
[SPEAKER_14]: And am I bad for laughing at this?

1789
02:35:52,751 --> 02:35:58,613
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's a little picture of the girl done in ASCII art that you could use in your signature on a forum if you wanted to.

1790
02:35:59,194 --> 02:36:03,775
[SPEAKER_14]: I could copy and paste that in IRC if I was feeling dumb, but I'm not going to, so...

1791
02:36:05,661 --> 02:36:05,881
[SPEAKER_14]: Ask Yes

1792
02:36:24,605 --> 02:36:25,206
[SPEAKER_14]: Moving on.

1793
02:36:25,886 --> 02:36:26,347
[SPEAKER_14]: Dork!

1794
02:36:26,867 --> 02:36:30,931
[SPEAKER_14]: Dork wants to know, where do you buy anime t-shirts online?

1795
02:36:31,631 --> 02:36:32,872
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know because I don't buy any.

1796
02:36:33,193 --> 02:36:37,917
[SPEAKER_14]: If I'm going to buy Japanese-inspired t-shirts, I'm going to be shopping at English.com.

1797
02:36:38,777 --> 02:36:40,959
[SPEAKER_14]: But I don't know about the anime shirts.

1798
02:36:41,200 --> 02:36:42,060
[SPEAKER_14]: Any ideas, Jamie?

1799
02:36:44,462 --> 02:36:45,223
[SPEAKER_14]: That's disgusting.

1800
02:36:45,283 --> 02:36:47,525
[SPEAKER_14]: Jamie, any ideas about the anime shirts?

1801
02:36:47,665 --> 02:36:47,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no.

1802
02:36:48,626 --> 02:36:49,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to San Francisco.

1803
02:36:50,147 --> 02:36:50,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki?

1804
02:36:53,383 --> 02:36:55,985
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, you might try, depends on what you're looking for.

1805
02:36:56,005 --> 02:37:10,513
[SPEAKER_13]: If you're looking for, um, I guess it would depend on what series you're looking for, because a lot of the film companies like ADV and stuff, they put out t-shirts along with their DVDs and stuff, so a site where you'd buy them, you'd probably be able to get the t-shirts from.

1806
02:37:10,634 --> 02:37:16,177
[SPEAKER_13]: I've tried maybe RightStuff.com, and I think that's stuff with one F, and, um,

1807
02:37:18,263 --> 02:37:19,204
[SPEAKER_13]: I think you might try there.

1808
02:37:19,444 --> 02:37:22,146
[SPEAKER_13]: And just do fucking Google search, anime t-shirts.

1809
02:37:22,186 --> 02:37:23,467
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sure you'll pull that shit up.

1810
02:37:25,249 --> 02:37:25,529
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

1811
02:37:27,931 --> 02:37:29,953
[SPEAKER_14]: You did not just say there's a Bukkake picture.

1812
02:37:31,174 --> 02:37:32,194
[SPEAKER_14]: That is disgusting.

1813
02:37:32,254 --> 02:37:32,715
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me see it.

1814
02:37:33,135 --> 02:37:33,896
[SPEAKER_14]: I have to see it now.

1815
02:37:36,398 --> 02:37:37,979
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh my god, I'm gonna die.

1816
02:37:37,999 --> 02:37:40,461
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, Misty has a question.

1817
02:37:42,162 --> 02:37:44,825
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my god, that's disgusting!

1818
02:37:51,175 --> 02:37:52,196
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm done with this show.

1819
02:37:52,256 --> 02:37:55,938
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm so done.

1820
02:37:56,258 --> 02:37:58,659
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate to say it, but some of them are just pretty funny.

1821
02:37:59,860 --> 02:38:01,360
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, simmer down for a minute.

1822
02:38:01,421 --> 02:38:02,781
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's listen to Misty's question.

1823
02:38:04,102 --> 02:38:05,583
[SPEAKER_14]: You okay over there, DarkSakura?

1824
02:38:07,304 --> 02:38:08,424
[SPEAKER_14]: You of all people.

1825
02:38:09,505 --> 02:38:10,966
[SPEAKER_14]: You are supposed to be a good girl.

1826
02:38:11,366 --> 02:38:11,926
[SPEAKER_05]: Bullshit.

1827
02:38:15,137 --> 02:38:15,978
[SPEAKER_14]: Misty has a question.

1828
02:38:16,018 --> 02:38:22,322
[SPEAKER_14]: Misty's question is, what is the first... Stop for a minute.

1829
02:38:23,102 --> 02:38:24,523
[SPEAKER_14]: Stop with the South Park, Nevada.

1830
02:38:24,543 --> 02:38:25,844
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, listen to Misty's question.

1831
02:38:26,525 --> 02:38:27,125
[SPEAKER_14]: Respect.

1832
02:38:28,526 --> 02:38:29,006
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that?

1833
02:38:29,046 --> 02:38:31,788
[SPEAKER_14]: What is the first Konami game that you remember playing?

1834
02:38:31,888 --> 02:38:33,709
[SPEAKER_14]: It doesn't matter if it's arcade or console.

1835
02:38:33,749 --> 02:38:35,130
[SPEAKER_14]: Hell, give both if you remember.

1836
02:38:37,192 --> 02:38:38,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably Castlevania.

1837
02:38:38,973 --> 02:38:40,133
[SPEAKER_14]: Castlevania was my first.

1838
02:38:40,213 --> 02:38:40,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Twin Beasts.

1839
02:38:41,174 --> 02:38:43,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, as it was on the NES, Stinger.

1840
02:38:44,525 --> 02:38:45,425
[SPEAKER_14]: Mmm, Stinger.

1841
02:38:45,806 --> 02:38:50,308
[SPEAKER_14]: I vividly remember getting Castlevania for like my birthday or something for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

1842
02:38:50,348 --> 02:38:51,508
[SPEAKER_14]: That was the first Konami game I had.

1843
02:38:51,849 --> 02:38:52,309
[SPEAKER_14]: You remember?

1844
02:38:52,329 --> 02:38:58,092
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if you remember this, but on the 8-bit Nintendo, the Konami games came in a unique sort of packaging.

1845
02:38:58,412 --> 02:39:01,893
[SPEAKER_14]: Sort of like the old Activision cartridges and the Atari 2600, they all looked the same.

1846
02:39:02,214 --> 02:39:03,814
[SPEAKER_14]: So did the Konami, they were all grey.

1847
02:39:03,874 --> 02:39:04,415
[SPEAKER_14]: You remember that?

1848
02:39:04,435 --> 02:39:05,475
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1849
02:39:05,915 --> 02:39:08,677
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I remember Castlevania was the first of those games that I owned.

1850
02:39:08,997 --> 02:39:09,217
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, Angel.

1851
02:39:09,237 --> 02:39:09,417
[SPEAKER_14]: Angel.

1852
02:39:10,046 --> 02:39:16,562
[SPEAKER_18]: The only one I remember, I know this is going to sound completely lame because it's one of the later games, but Contra.

1853
02:39:17,671 --> 02:39:21,932
[SPEAKER_14]: I used to play the hell out of Contra I remember playing Contra on one of those ones My first game was Lifeforce

1854
02:39:47,067 --> 02:40:01,522
[SPEAKER_13]: That was one of the first three games I had on Nintendo because I got Breakthrough, Zelda, and I think Lifeforce were the first three games I had on Nintendo.

1855
02:40:01,542 --> 02:40:04,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, we know Lifeforce also as Salamander.

1856
02:40:04,325 --> 02:40:07,008
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I know, but this was Lifeforce, not Salamander.

1857
02:40:09,272 --> 02:40:18,401
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just like how what got me into DDR were the games Bust a Groove, and I know it's Bust a Move in Japan, but when I played it, it was Bust a Groove.

1858
02:40:18,461 --> 02:40:24,947
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't even know there was an import scene until I got into this DDR stuff, so I guess that's one way you could put it.

1859
02:40:25,367 --> 02:40:27,529
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know Jamie loves it when I call it Bust a Groove.

1860
02:40:28,670 --> 02:40:30,412
[SPEAKER_14]: Bust a Groove, Bust a Groove, Bust a Groove!

1861
02:40:31,433 --> 02:40:32,254
[SPEAKER_14]: I just got the finger.

1862
02:40:32,674 --> 02:40:34,336
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, Blarg has a question.

1863
02:40:40,560 --> 02:40:46,904
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not sure if this has been asked before, but would any of you participate in some bukkake action if given the chance?

1864
02:40:47,124 --> 02:40:47,464
[SPEAKER_14]: P.S.

1865
02:40:47,504 --> 02:40:48,165
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not offering.

1866
02:40:48,305 --> 02:40:48,505
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1867
02:40:49,846 --> 02:40:51,067
[SPEAKER_14]: How do you know we haven't already?

1868
02:40:53,889 --> 02:40:54,549
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think so.

1869
02:40:55,970 --> 02:40:58,912
[SPEAKER_14]: Unless it's like cake frosting bukkake or something.

1870
02:40:59,452 --> 02:41:00,813
[SPEAKER_14]: Because cake frosting is yummy.

1871
02:41:01,274 --> 02:41:02,334
[SPEAKER_14]: As opposed, yes?

1872
02:41:02,795 --> 02:41:03,215
[SPEAKER_18]: Sushi.

1873
02:41:05,516 --> 02:41:06,137
[SPEAKER_18]: What the hell?

1874
02:41:06,818 --> 02:41:08,279
[SPEAKER_18]: You don't remember the sushi?

1875
02:41:08,379 --> 02:41:08,700
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1876
02:41:08,760 --> 02:41:09,260
[SPEAKER_18]: Down there?

1877
02:41:09,280 --> 02:41:10,041
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember.

1878
02:41:10,061 --> 02:41:10,481
[SPEAKER_14]: Over there?

1879
02:41:10,881 --> 02:41:11,602
[SPEAKER_18]: Down the street?

1880
02:41:11,822 --> 02:41:12,443
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember.

1881
02:41:13,063 --> 02:41:13,744
[SPEAKER_14]: That's disgusting.

1882
02:41:13,764 --> 02:41:14,925
[SPEAKER_18]: You're the one that mentioned it, too.

1883
02:41:18,263 --> 02:41:20,304
[SPEAKER_14]: Our listeners have way too much free time on their hands.

1884
02:41:20,324 --> 02:41:22,565
[SPEAKER_14]: You need to go read a book or something.

1885
02:41:22,645 --> 02:41:23,706
[SPEAKER_14]: Take the other guy's advice.

1886
02:41:24,166 --> 02:41:24,506
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1887
02:41:25,167 --> 02:41:26,508
[SPEAKER_14]: John Fields has a question.

1888
02:41:26,868 --> 02:41:37,854
[SPEAKER_14]: If you had your choice of getting sucked inside your TV and ending up inside of a video game, non-bomani and non-porn, Loki, no bubble bath babes for you, what game would it be?

1889
02:41:39,075 --> 02:41:39,915
[SPEAKER_14]: What game would it be?

1890
02:41:41,376 --> 02:41:45,258
[SPEAKER_14]: If you had to get sucked into your TV into a video game, any thoughts?

1891
02:41:45,882 --> 02:41:46,722
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a weird question.

1892
02:41:46,742 --> 02:41:47,983
[SPEAKER_14]: This is such a nerd question.

1893
02:41:49,183 --> 02:41:51,144
[SPEAKER_14]: This is funny.

1894
02:41:51,304 --> 02:41:51,545
[SPEAKER_14]: Angel.

1895
02:41:52,345 --> 02:41:53,445
[SPEAKER_18]: Why do I have to go first?

1896
02:41:53,465 --> 02:41:54,286
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I'm making you.

1897
02:41:55,206 --> 02:41:56,907
[SPEAKER_14]: Jamie, are you going to participate in tonight's show?

1898
02:41:57,267 --> 02:41:58,508
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, this is funny.

1899
02:41:58,648 --> 02:42:01,229
[SPEAKER_14]: If you had to get sucked into any video game, what would it be?

1900
02:42:04,390 --> 02:42:05,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Sucked into any video game?

1901
02:42:06,291 --> 02:42:07,512
[SPEAKER_14]: Non-bomani, non-porn.

1902
02:42:09,373 --> 02:42:12,394
[SPEAKER_14]: This is one of the top three nerdiest questions I think we've ever gotten.

1903
02:42:13,354 --> 02:42:14,655
[SPEAKER_02]: I honestly couldn't say.

1904
02:42:19,978 --> 02:42:23,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably Puyo Puyo.

1905
02:42:23,841 --> 02:42:28,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Wouldn't it be cool just to walk along through the forest and solve all your problems by having a friendly puzzle game?

1906
02:42:32,674 --> 02:42:38,217
[SPEAKER_18]: I was going to say Mr. Driller just because it's the game I can't stop playing right now, but that just doesn't sound right.

1907
02:42:38,237 --> 02:42:42,199
[SPEAKER_14]: You'd be drilling all day long and then you'd suffocate and fly away like a little angel.

1908
02:42:42,219 --> 02:42:44,960
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm good at suffocating if you've ever watched me play.

1909
02:42:45,961 --> 02:42:46,341
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki.

1910
02:42:52,424 --> 02:42:58,387
[SPEAKER_13]: I would have to say... That just put me in Rumble Roses because...

1911
02:43:01,573 --> 02:43:30,236
[SPEAKER_13]: non-porn that's not porn fuck that shit that ain't porn Grand Theft Auto that ain't fun you'd be perfect for Grand Theft Auto no, that's too much work I'd do either Mario or Zelda because I'd have to beat all the characters' pansy asses because they're lame I'm going to defeat you with oh no, turtles are going to kill me I'd be like, fuck that shit

1912
02:43:30,677 --> 02:43:31,018
[SPEAKER_13]: Marvel Madness

1913
02:43:43,735 --> 02:43:45,116
[SPEAKER_14]: You just slide down the hill.

1914
02:43:45,437 --> 02:43:48,520
[SPEAKER_14]: Whee!

1915
02:43:49,921 --> 02:43:52,704
[SPEAKER_14]: I would have to say BurgerTime, because hamburgers are yummy.

1916
02:43:52,744 --> 02:43:53,786
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

1917
02:43:53,826 --> 02:43:56,428
[SPEAKER_14]: Dartitsu, you said that in the chat room, so I had to say that.

1918
02:43:56,809 --> 02:43:58,751
[SPEAKER_14]: No, actually, I already had some answers thought of.

1919
02:43:59,231 --> 02:43:59,912
[SPEAKER_14]: Legend of Zelda.

1920
02:44:00,252 --> 02:44:00,693
[SPEAKER_10]: Yay!

1921
02:44:00,733 --> 02:44:02,515
[SPEAKER_14]: Because that was just such a cute game.

1922
02:44:03,215 --> 02:44:13,519
[SPEAKER_14]: or I would have to say Pokemon, because very similar to Jamie, what if we could just settle our scores by having our pets do battle instead of us, you know, just have our pets.

1923
02:44:13,539 --> 02:44:15,940
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie would sit on whatever pet you had and win.

1924
02:44:18,448 --> 02:44:21,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Or... It sure means, like, Snorax, or whatever it was called.

1925
02:44:21,489 --> 02:44:23,009
[SPEAKER_14]: Or... Final Fantasy IV.

1926
02:44:23,549 --> 02:44:25,209
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I just have so many good memories about that game.

1927
02:44:25,409 --> 02:44:28,730
[SPEAKER_14]: And I... I practically did live that game, back when I was a kid.

1928
02:44:29,090 --> 02:44:31,331
[SPEAKER_14]: When I was a kid, I did live that game, okay?

1929
02:44:31,431 --> 02:44:31,991
[SPEAKER_14]: So, what can I say?

1930
02:44:32,011 --> 02:44:33,091
[SPEAKER_18]: I just thought of another good one.

1931
02:44:33,311 --> 02:44:33,491
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1932
02:44:33,711 --> 02:44:34,491
[SPEAKER_18]: From the old school.

1933
02:44:35,111 --> 02:44:35,732
[SPEAKER_18]: Kid Icarus.

1934
02:44:36,732 --> 02:44:40,433
[SPEAKER_18]: Or Icarus, or whatever the hell you wanna... However the heck you wanna pronounce it.

1935
02:44:40,553 --> 02:44:40,833
[SPEAKER_18]: You know.

1936
02:44:41,333 --> 02:44:41,893
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that was a good one.

1937
02:44:42,293 --> 02:44:44,253
[SPEAKER_14]: Even the... I like some of the answers the chatroom's giving.

1938
02:44:44,313 --> 02:44:46,514
[SPEAKER_14]: Even Naoki2DX says, I'd be in Katamari Damashii.

1939
02:44:47,314 --> 02:44:47,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh!

1940
02:44:48,652 --> 02:44:49,593
[SPEAKER_14]: Leisure Suit Larry.

1941
02:44:53,775 --> 02:44:56,536
[SPEAKER_13]: Or BMX Triple X. Nah, BMX Triple X is too much work.

1942
02:44:56,736 --> 02:44:57,377
[SPEAKER_13]: Leisure Suit Larry.

1943
02:45:00,919 --> 02:45:05,261
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkLionXVI says, what do you think of my Dancer video I linked you last week?

1944
02:45:05,321 --> 02:45:07,082
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, it was Dancer.

1945
02:45:07,142 --> 02:45:07,843
[SPEAKER_14]: I love Dancer.

1946
02:45:07,983 --> 02:45:08,523
[SPEAKER_14]: What can I say?

1947
02:45:08,583 --> 02:45:09,804
[SPEAKER_14]: Dancer is fabulous.

1948
02:45:11,745 --> 02:45:12,805
[SPEAKER_14]: I highly recommend Dancer.

1949
02:45:13,085 --> 02:45:14,786
[SPEAKER_14]: You should go ahead and post the link in our chat.

1950
02:45:14,806 --> 02:45:17,548
[SPEAKER_14]: Let the chat people see it so that they can know what I'm talking about.

1951
02:45:19,301 --> 02:45:23,864
[SPEAKER_14]: What's the best way to make two brothers have sex and stay somewhat hidden with your video camera?

1952
02:45:23,884 --> 02:45:24,365
[SPEAKER_14]: Drugs, lots of drugs.

1953
02:45:46,397 --> 02:45:51,579
[SPEAKER_14]: Seriously, if you had them do enough ecstasy and alcohol, they would not be able to even see you there in the corner.

1954
02:45:51,599 --> 02:45:53,179
[SPEAKER_14]: You'd just be another fixture.

1955
02:45:53,199 --> 02:45:56,801
[SPEAKER_14]: You know like in cartoons when they're trying to disguise themselves?

1956
02:45:57,621 --> 02:45:58,801
[SPEAKER_13]: You'd probably be able to join in.

1957
02:45:59,602 --> 02:46:02,163
[SPEAKER_14]: You know how you could disguise yourself as a palm tree?

1958
02:46:02,803 --> 02:46:03,703
[SPEAKER_14]: Or as a lamp?

1959
02:46:03,743 --> 02:46:06,484
[SPEAKER_14]: No, this was just on Drawn Together a couple weeks ago.

1960
02:46:06,744 --> 02:46:09,885
[SPEAKER_14]: You could disguise yourself as a lamp by just putting a lampshade on your head.

1961
02:46:10,566 --> 02:46:12,826
[SPEAKER_14]: So you could do that and then have your video camera there.

1962
02:46:13,987 --> 02:46:14,647
[SPEAKER_14]: And you're just a lamp.

1963
02:46:19,059 --> 02:46:20,019
[SPEAKER_14]: You guys are sick.

1964
02:46:22,520 --> 02:46:24,761
[SPEAKER_14]: Illusion has an Orange Lounge Radio question.

1965
02:46:27,121 --> 02:46:33,183
[SPEAKER_14]: If you drop a kitty in a blender and you shuffle cards at the same time, what are you guys doing for New Year's Eve?

1966
02:46:42,926 --> 02:46:45,467
[SPEAKER_14]: I think there's only one part of that question you needed to hear.

1967
02:46:45,527 --> 02:46:45,787
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki.

1968
02:46:47,230 --> 02:46:50,331
[SPEAKER_13]: Easy, that's what I'm doing for New Year's.

1969
02:46:50,631 --> 02:46:52,692
[SPEAKER_13]: Dropping a kitty in a blender and shuffling cards.

1970
02:46:54,212 --> 02:46:55,813
[SPEAKER_13]: It's kitty smoothie and poker.

1971
02:47:00,754 --> 02:47:03,695
[SPEAKER_14]: Jamie, do you have a serious answer for this poor question?

1972
02:47:04,536 --> 02:47:06,776
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be heavily intoxicated.

1973
02:47:07,236 --> 02:47:12,138
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, whatever I do, there will be drinking involved and hopefully sex if I get my way.

1974
02:47:13,680 --> 02:47:16,662
[SPEAKER_14]: Just not with two brothers, because I'm not into that.

1975
02:47:18,163 --> 02:47:19,123
[SPEAKER_14]: Angel, you thinking over there?

1976
02:47:19,183 --> 02:47:20,704
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you have a plot, a plan?

1977
02:47:23,026 --> 02:47:28,129
[SPEAKER_18]: Not for the kitty questions, like whatever, but... I think that was just a red herring.

1978
02:47:28,149 --> 02:47:29,329
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think that was the actual question.

1979
02:47:29,349 --> 02:47:30,410
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the question was New Year's Eve.

1980
02:47:30,850 --> 02:47:33,112
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, um... I don't know.

1981
02:47:33,132 --> 02:47:35,513
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know what I'm doing for New Year's or whatever.

1982
02:47:36,134 --> 02:47:38,455
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe somebody will kidnap me so we can all have a good time.

1983
02:47:40,496 --> 02:47:41,737
[SPEAKER_18]: Because kidnappings are fun.

1984
02:47:42,605 --> 02:47:46,026
[SPEAKER_13]: I know this is, like, way late, but I remember two things I'm mad at.

1985
02:47:47,407 --> 02:47:48,807
[SPEAKER_13]: And these are both movie-related, too.

1986
02:47:49,627 --> 02:47:55,829
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, I'm pissed off at Closer, because, um, Nellie Portman did not get naked.

1987
02:47:56,790 --> 02:48:11,655
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm also pissed off at this other game, or, not, this other show called, uh, My Life, or, yeah, The Life, or something like that, starring Denise Richards, and SHE DIDN'T GET NAKED IN THAT EITHER, IT'S A FUCKING UNRATED GODDAMNED DVD!

1988
02:48:12,964 --> 02:48:13,865
[SPEAKER_13]: It's supposed to get naked!

1989
02:48:14,345 --> 02:48:15,206
[SPEAKER_13]: NAKED!

1990
02:48:15,546 --> 02:48:19,628
[SPEAKER_13]: Your Playboy fucking get naked on the goddamn- It's a foreign film, even!

1991
02:48:19,929 --> 02:48:22,130
[SPEAKER_13]: Where nudity's not even a big deal, but no!

1992
02:48:23,131 --> 02:48:25,152
[SPEAKER_13]: Show your tits in fucking Playboy!

1993
02:48:25,613 --> 02:48:27,134
[SPEAKER_13]: The worst fucking magazine out there.

1994
02:48:27,694 --> 02:48:28,855
[SPEAKER_13]: Next to Entertainment Weekly.

1995
02:48:30,776 --> 02:48:31,056
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways.

1996
02:48:32,977 --> 02:48:33,638
[SPEAKER_14]: And New Year's Eve.

1997
02:48:35,939 --> 02:48:37,140
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, probably watch TV.

1998
02:48:37,200 --> 02:48:38,001
[SPEAKER_13]: What did we do last year?

1999
02:48:38,061 --> 02:48:41,003
[SPEAKER_13]: I watched an Iron Chef marathon and then we had sex.

2000
02:48:44,209 --> 02:48:46,431
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds like the perfect way to spend New Year's Eve.

2001
02:48:47,432 --> 02:48:50,774
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't remember if it was New Year's or that was how I spent Halloween.

2002
02:48:51,155 --> 02:48:55,398
[SPEAKER_13]: It was one of those holidays when we watched an Iron Chef marathon and had sex.

2003
02:48:57,159 --> 02:48:58,280
[SPEAKER_13]: That could have been both, actually.

2004
02:49:00,342 --> 02:49:00,642
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow.

2005
02:49:01,563 --> 02:49:02,224
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it was New Year's.

2006
02:49:02,904 --> 02:49:04,025
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, anyway, that's fine.

2007
02:49:04,325 --> 02:49:07,468
[SPEAKER_14]: I got invited to a party, so I'll probably go.

2008
02:49:07,628 --> 02:49:08,849
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what I'm doing for New Year's.

2009
02:49:10,934 --> 02:49:14,177
[SPEAKER_14]: Unless the chance to have sex comes up, then I will ditch everybody.

2010
02:49:15,699 --> 02:49:16,520
[SPEAKER_14]: And it has to be good sex.

2011
02:49:16,960 --> 02:49:21,685
[SPEAKER_14]: EvilMalky2DX says, Speaking of internet crazes, ever heard of the OS Girls?

2012
02:49:22,326 --> 02:49:28,312
[SPEAKER_14]: If y'all don't know, basically people in Japan created anime mascots for different operating systems.

2013
02:49:28,392 --> 02:49:31,395
[SPEAKER_14]: But the real question... Okay, so have you guys ever heard of this?

2014
02:49:32,156 --> 02:49:33,617
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, I have.

2015
02:49:33,778 --> 02:49:34,198
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you think?

2016
02:49:34,878 --> 02:49:38,141
[SPEAKER_13]: They did one that was posted on... Fuck, I don't remember now.

2017
02:49:38,161 --> 02:49:43,926
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it was on Slashdot for Firefox, and they did some furry for that.

2018
02:49:45,247 --> 02:49:45,748
[SPEAKER_13]: Some chick.

2019
02:49:45,868 --> 02:49:55,456
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't get to see the other ones, because the link that they posted it to didn't... I couldn't find them in the person's gallery, but it was interesting.

2020
02:49:55,897 --> 02:49:56,217
[SPEAKER_13]: I think I...

2021
02:49:57,315 --> 02:50:00,257
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to say I posted that in my live journal, but I can't remember if I did or not.

2022
02:50:00,337 --> 02:50:01,938
[SPEAKER_18]: Nope, I know who posted it in their live journal.

2023
02:50:02,038 --> 02:50:07,181
[SPEAKER_13]: But, um, someone posted it in their live journal, and I'm going to show Rob here in the studio.

2024
02:50:07,341 --> 02:50:10,924
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, actually, fuck, I'm going to have to, like, go through five pages of Friends stuff to find it.

2025
02:50:11,744 --> 02:50:12,705
[SPEAKER_13]: Remember who posted that?

2026
02:50:14,646 --> 02:50:14,906
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

2027
02:50:15,867 --> 02:50:17,688
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways, Rob talk and I'll find it.

2028
02:50:18,509 --> 02:50:18,809
[SPEAKER_14]: Fine.

2029
02:50:18,889 --> 02:50:23,592
[SPEAKER_14]: The real question that even the Aoki2DX wants to ask is, what do y'all think of internet crazes?

2030
02:50:25,393 --> 02:50:26,414
[SPEAKER_14]: I think they're funny.

2031
02:50:28,470 --> 02:50:30,392
[SPEAKER_14]: I think they're funny until they get old.

2032
02:50:30,792 --> 02:50:32,574
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, like, some things are getting old.

2033
02:50:32,654 --> 02:50:36,057
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, I'm sorry, because I know Jamie's a fan, but I think Strong Bad is kind of old now.

2034
02:50:37,719 --> 02:50:39,640
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I say I was a fan?

2035
02:50:40,001 --> 02:50:41,882
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I just know you quote Strong Bad a lot.

2036
02:50:42,403 --> 02:50:45,386
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because I live with Dan, and Dan quotes Strong Bad a lot.

2037
02:50:47,207 --> 02:50:50,550
[SPEAKER_14]: I just think Homestar Runner is kind of like so last year.

2038
02:50:53,693 --> 02:50:53,954
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2039
02:50:55,214 --> 02:50:55,855
[SPEAKER_14]: Anything else?

2040
02:50:55,895 --> 02:50:56,596
[SPEAKER_14]: Internet crazes?

2041
02:50:56,636 --> 02:50:58,278
[SPEAKER_14]: Anybody else have a comment on internet crazes?

2042
02:50:59,299 --> 02:51:01,041
[SPEAKER_18]: No, because I can't think of any at the moment.

2043
02:51:01,902 --> 02:51:02,983
[SPEAKER_14]: How about the hamster dance?

2044
02:51:03,103 --> 02:51:04,405
[SPEAKER_14]: That was like three years ago.

2045
02:51:04,825 --> 02:51:05,846
[SPEAKER_14]: The dancing baby.

2046
02:51:06,347 --> 02:51:08,049
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, okay, the dancing baby.

2047
02:51:08,089 --> 02:51:08,570
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, alright.

2048
02:51:09,290 --> 02:51:11,373
[SPEAKER_18]: Eh, yeah, they're funny until they get old.

2049
02:51:12,150 --> 02:51:15,052
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a scary comment from Dark Knight in the chatroom.

2050
02:51:15,172 --> 02:51:21,137
[SPEAKER_14]: I could see the chairman starting Loki's sex romp.

2051
02:51:22,298 --> 02:51:24,120
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, from Iron Chef.

2052
02:51:24,420 --> 02:51:25,361
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I saw that picture.

2053
02:51:25,401 --> 02:51:26,942
[SPEAKER_14]: There's the Firefox anime girl.

2054
02:51:27,002 --> 02:51:29,424
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you, like, just post a link to chatroom or something?

2055
02:51:29,844 --> 02:51:30,145
No, I can't.

2056
02:51:31,045 --> 02:51:31,366
[SPEAKER_14]: Why not?

2057
02:51:31,586 --> 02:51:32,326
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, because you're not in chat.

2058
02:51:32,366 --> 02:51:33,787
[SPEAKER_14]: No, because I can't log in.

2059
02:51:33,807 --> 02:51:34,368
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, that sucks.

2060
02:51:35,117 --> 02:51:35,697
[SPEAKER_14]: Sucks to be you.

2061
02:51:37,358 --> 02:51:39,299
[SPEAKER_14]: Moving on with the questions, Ask Orange Lounge.

2062
02:51:39,339 --> 02:51:46,202
[SPEAKER_14]: If you have a question, you can send it to us via private message in IRC, or you can also give us a call on the Skype line.

2063
02:51:46,222 --> 02:51:49,324
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to open up the Skype line for you boys and girls that want to give us a call over there.

2064
02:51:50,484 --> 02:51:58,588
[SPEAKER_14]: Legend of Zaku says, if I were to down this death brick called the Hardee's Monster Thick Burger, I don't know if you've heard about this.

2065
02:51:59,204 --> 02:52:00,425
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, those things are humongous.

2066
02:52:00,505 --> 02:52:01,066
[SPEAKER_14]: I saw one.

2067
02:52:01,106 --> 02:52:01,827
[SPEAKER_14]: It looked nasty.

2068
02:52:02,607 --> 02:52:09,494
[SPEAKER_14]: What Oni courses would I have to do in order to burn off the 1400 plus calories that I'm taking in as a result of this burger?

2069
02:52:09,754 --> 02:52:10,235
[SPEAKER_14]: All of them.

2070
02:52:10,375 --> 02:52:12,016
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, all of them, basically.

2071
02:52:12,177 --> 02:52:13,017
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll put it this way.

2072
02:52:13,138 --> 02:52:15,099
[SPEAKER_14]: Legend Road five times.

2073
02:52:15,440 --> 02:52:20,625
[SPEAKER_02]: You would have to lift weights vigorously for four solid hours to burn off that many calories.

2074
02:52:22,076 --> 02:52:34,143
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm surprised Loki, I'm looking at the site right now, I'm surprised, and it's making that lightning noise right here, it's Hardee's.com, and I want Loki to see this, it's the Monster Burger.

2075
02:52:36,365 --> 02:52:40,808
[SPEAKER_14]: Hardee's, of course, somewhat related to Carl's Jr., it's the Monster Thick Burger, look at that.

2076
02:52:41,848 --> 02:52:44,230
[SPEAKER_13]: That's just a fucking bacon ultimate cheeseburger, that's all that is.

2077
02:52:46,559 --> 02:52:48,659
[SPEAKER_14]: It's more than a bacon ultimate cheeseburger.

2078
02:52:48,699 --> 02:52:49,720
[SPEAKER_02]: They're pretty humongous.

2079
02:52:49,740 --> 02:52:51,940
[SPEAKER_14]: They're larger than the $6 burger.

2080
02:52:51,980 --> 02:52:54,681
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that's like two of those $6 patties right there.

2081
02:52:54,781 --> 02:52:57,061
[SPEAKER_14]: And, like, look at whatever that sauce is right there.

2082
02:52:58,601 --> 02:52:59,021
[SPEAKER_14]: Yikes.

2083
02:53:01,922 --> 02:53:07,003
[SPEAKER_13]: If you go to fucking Fuddruckers, you can get one pound patties there, okay?

2084
02:53:07,103 --> 02:53:09,843
[SPEAKER_13]: So that burger ain't shit, okay?

2085
02:53:11,844 --> 02:53:12,624
[SPEAKER_13]: But yeah, it looks tasty.

2086
02:53:14,378 --> 02:53:15,439
[SPEAKER_14]: John Fields has a question.

2087
02:53:15,619 --> 02:53:20,663
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, what if the chatroom forced Orange Lounge Radio to do a kids show like those you see on Nick Jr.

2088
02:53:20,683 --> 02:53:21,944
[SPEAKER_14]: because of tonight's cage match?

2089
02:53:22,124 --> 02:53:24,666
[SPEAKER_14]: What would it be like if the show were on Nick Jr.? ?

2090
02:53:36,328 --> 02:53:37,569
[SPEAKER_00]: We wouldn't be on Nick Jr.

2091
02:53:38,349 --> 02:53:42,172
[SPEAKER_14]: I would sell this show out to anybody that would take it and I know you guys would too and if Nick Jr.

2092
02:53:42,192 --> 02:53:49,397
[SPEAKER_14]: was there I would have a live studio audience filled with children and I would make DarkSakura lecture them on proper grammar all night.

2093
02:53:52,440 --> 02:53:56,402
[SPEAKER_02]: And then have remedial class for their parents on how to do their fucking jobs.

2094
02:53:59,124 --> 02:53:59,545
[SPEAKER_14]: Beautiful.

2095
02:54:01,126 --> 02:54:02,487
[SPEAKER_14]: Last question of the evening.

2096
02:54:03,649 --> 02:54:06,394
[SPEAKER_14]: From Sigurd, okay, a real question.

2097
02:54:07,096 --> 02:54:10,402
[SPEAKER_14]: Are there any solid plans for an E3 show this year?

2098
02:54:12,105 --> 02:54:18,709
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I guess one of the big questions is if we even get to go to E3 in the first place.

2099
02:54:19,170 --> 02:54:20,691
[SPEAKER_14]: We know DarkSakura gets to go.

2100
02:54:20,771 --> 02:54:24,013
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki and I are pretty sure we're going to get to go again.

2101
02:54:24,713 --> 02:54:25,594
[SPEAKER_14]: Cards look good.

2102
02:54:25,634 --> 02:54:27,255
[SPEAKER_14]: If you went the year before, you can go again.

2103
02:54:27,315 --> 02:54:28,556
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're kind of hoping that can happen.

2104
02:54:28,996 --> 02:54:34,220
[SPEAKER_14]: So the answer is if we can get everything we need, which would include a laptop,

2105
02:54:34,965 --> 02:54:35,666
[SPEAKER_14]: Hint, hint, Jamie.

2106
02:54:35,846 --> 02:54:37,650
[SPEAKER_14]: Hint, hint, Jamie.

2107
02:54:38,111 --> 02:54:46,287
[SPEAKER_14]: And we stay in a nice enough hotel this time where we're not in the Motel 6 in the middle of Hollywood and we instead stay at a motel that has free high-speed internet access.

2108
02:54:47,284 --> 02:54:50,366
[SPEAKER_14]: Motel 7, or at least a Holiday Inn, which I think has that.

2109
02:54:50,746 --> 02:54:52,528
[SPEAKER_14]: If we could do that, then yes, we could do a show.

2110
02:54:52,628 --> 02:54:55,009
[SPEAKER_14]: Not necessarily from E3, but from the hotel.

2111
02:54:55,049 --> 02:54:56,410
[SPEAKER_14]: But here's the other part of the question.

2112
02:54:56,750 --> 02:55:00,513
[SPEAKER_14]: Would we want to spend our time in LA doing this program?

2113
02:55:00,673 --> 02:55:01,053
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

2114
02:55:01,554 --> 02:55:02,394
[SPEAKER_14]: So, maybe.

2115
02:55:02,955 --> 02:55:04,856
[SPEAKER_14]: I think if worse comes to worse, we'll do something.

2116
02:55:04,896 --> 02:55:06,957
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll do lots of tape segments from E3.

2117
02:55:07,238 --> 02:55:09,019
[SPEAKER_14]: We're trying to do more at E3 this year.

2118
02:55:09,719 --> 02:55:11,380
[SPEAKER_14]: Assuming, we have to find out if we can go first.

2119
02:55:11,400 --> 02:55:15,423
[SPEAKER_14]: But if we can go, we're hoping to get more interviews and some many more fun stuff at E3.

2120
02:55:15,463 --> 02:55:15,864
[SPEAKER_14]: But again...

2121
02:55:17,313 --> 02:55:19,034
[SPEAKER_14]: It's still December.

2122
02:55:19,275 --> 02:55:19,995
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a little early.

2123
02:55:21,816 --> 02:55:23,558
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we'll see soon enough.

2124
02:55:26,220 --> 02:55:29,442
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, that's going to do it for tonight's Ask Orange Lounge segment.

2125
02:55:31,043 --> 02:55:32,244
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you say we do another break?

2126
02:55:32,765 --> 02:55:34,626
[SPEAKER_14]: A quick break and come back and wrap it up.

2127
02:55:36,007 --> 02:55:36,728
[SPEAKER_14]: You guys okay with that?

2128
02:55:37,789 --> 02:55:38,349
[SPEAKER_18]: Works for me.

2129
02:55:38,649 --> 02:55:42,052
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, let's do a break and in this break we're going to hear... I want to hear something new.

2130
02:55:42,072 --> 02:55:43,433
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to hear an Ultramix 2 song.

2131
02:55:43,473 --> 02:55:43,813
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's do...

2132
02:55:45,538 --> 02:55:46,719
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, what song sounds good to you?

2133
02:55:46,779 --> 02:55:49,762
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's do the Delirium song, since we're having a Delirium night.

2134
02:55:50,282 --> 02:55:50,863
[SPEAKER_14]: How's that sound?

2135
02:55:52,524 --> 02:55:53,125
[SPEAKER_02]: That works for me.

2136
02:55:53,145 --> 02:55:56,247
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, we will be right back after this to wrap it up.

2137
02:55:56,688 --> 02:55:57,168
[SPEAKER_14]: Stay with us.

2138
02:55:58,569 --> 02:56:01,572
[SPEAKER_14]: The best is yet to come, because we all know the best part of the show is when it's over.

2139
02:56:03,141 --> 02:56:08,025
[SPEAKER_05]: She knows the voices in her mind Say hello to me She says it's my nightmare

2140
02:57:17,384 --> 02:57:18,473
I'm the one they say to love

2141
02:57:56,854 --> 02:57:57,294
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello?

2142
02:57:58,075 --> 02:57:59,096
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello, is this thing on?

2143
02:57:59,156 --> 02:57:59,656
[SPEAKER_14]: Testing.

2144
02:58:00,837 --> 02:58:01,718
[SPEAKER_14]: Testing, one, two.

2145
02:58:02,299 --> 02:58:06,242
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking in the index, but I don't see anything for how to run a radio show.

2146
02:58:06,342 --> 02:58:06,823
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello?

2147
02:58:07,503 --> 02:58:08,964
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't understand this.

2148
02:58:09,425 --> 02:58:10,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Does this thing work?

2149
02:58:10,366 --> 02:58:11,967
[SPEAKER_02]: This thing reads like stereo instructions.

2150
02:58:12,027 --> 02:58:12,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this on?

2151
02:58:12,668 --> 02:58:13,248
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell?

2152
02:58:15,810 --> 02:58:17,212
[SPEAKER_17]: Orange Lounge Radio.

2153
02:58:17,392 --> 02:58:19,594
[SPEAKER_17]: Broke Down Ghetto Bomani Radio.

2154
02:58:19,674 --> 02:58:19,874
[SPEAKER_05]: What the?

2155
02:58:22,185 --> 02:58:23,647
[SPEAKER_14]: We are back to wrap it up.

2156
02:58:24,207 --> 02:58:25,569
[SPEAKER_14]: Show's just about done with.

2157
02:58:25,909 --> 02:58:27,912
[SPEAKER_14]: Another Sunday night, another show.

2158
02:58:28,553 --> 02:58:30,535
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll be back next week with more fun stuff.

2159
02:58:30,555 --> 02:58:32,497
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to try and line up a special guest for next week.

2160
02:58:32,537 --> 02:58:35,201
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to do an interview next week, so we're going to try and line up a special guest.

2161
02:58:35,221 --> 02:58:36,162
[SPEAKER_14]: Does that sound good to you guys?

2162
02:58:37,199 --> 02:58:39,641
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I thought I'd bring up the game, or I can bring it up going after the script.

2163
02:59:00,880 --> 02:59:04,182
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, that game that I like and that I got addicted to this week.

2164
02:59:04,462 --> 02:59:05,883
[SPEAKER_14]: My bad, totally forgot about it.

2165
02:59:05,923 --> 02:59:06,743
[SPEAKER_14]: Bring it up real quick.

2166
02:59:06,783 --> 02:59:07,684
[SPEAKER_14]: Tell the folks about it.

2167
02:59:07,704 --> 02:59:08,224
[SPEAKER_14]: What's it all about?

2168
02:59:08,944 --> 02:59:15,108
[SPEAKER_18]: It's basically a side-scrolling RPG game called MapleStory.

2169
02:59:15,188 --> 02:59:16,589
[SPEAKER_18]: Side-scrolling RPG?

2170
02:59:16,789 --> 02:59:16,989
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

2171
02:59:17,049 --> 02:59:17,969
[SPEAKER_14]: What is that game?

2172
02:59:18,209 --> 02:59:22,792
[SPEAKER_18]: It kind of reminded me of Mystical Ninja at first, but, I don't know, it's pretty cool.

2173
02:59:22,812 --> 02:59:24,013
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, you can pick up coins and stuff.

2174
02:59:24,053 --> 02:59:24,573
[SPEAKER_18]: It's pretty cute.

2175
02:59:25,348 --> 02:59:27,949
[SPEAKER_18]: It's one of those cutesy ones again, you know, like Ragnarok was.

2176
02:59:27,989 --> 02:59:31,410
[SPEAKER_18]: It was cutesy, and it was cool, and it still is cool, but, you know.

2177
02:59:32,390 --> 02:59:34,311
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, um, what was it?

2178
02:59:34,451 --> 02:59:36,992
[SPEAKER_18]: Maple... I can't think of the website now.

2179
02:59:37,032 --> 02:59:38,552
[SPEAKER_18]: MapleStory.

2180
02:59:38,592 --> 02:59:39,732
[SPEAKER_18]: No, the game's MapleStory.

2181
02:59:41,273 --> 02:59:44,694
[SPEAKER_18]: MapleGlobal.net or .com, I can't remember.

2182
02:59:45,054 --> 02:59:51,416
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, for those people that want to check it out, go to MapleGlobal.com or .net.

2183
02:59:52,616 --> 02:59:53,356
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe it's .com.

2184
02:59:54,297 --> 02:59:54,977
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's .com.

2185
02:59:58,123 --> 02:59:58,523
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not?

2186
02:59:58,803 --> 03:00:23,991
[SPEAKER_14]: EvilNauki EvilNauki in our chatroom says MapleStory.com is the site I think it's MapleGlobal.com Anyway, that's where I found the thing to download it and register and all that stuff Sounds interesting, I might have to check this out Seems like a few people in our chat have heard of this before, so we'll see Alright, Angel's gonna hook me up with that later so I can check it out Loki, your final thought Oh, I'm sorry, Angel, is that your final thought, pretty much?

2187
03:00:25,111 --> 03:00:26,752
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, bye Mr. Driller, cause it's fun

2188
03:00:27,341 --> 03:00:28,122
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, your final thought.

2189
03:00:28,902 --> 03:00:30,324
[SPEAKER_02]: It is MapleStory.com.

2190
03:00:31,404 --> 03:00:42,274
[SPEAKER_13]: My final thought is I'm probably going to play some more Final Fantasy tonight because I like that game and I've spent so much time on it and yeah, that's all.

2191
03:00:44,415 --> 03:00:48,299
[SPEAKER_14]: Jamie, my final thought is I'm probably going to do the same thing as soon as I take Angel home.

2192
03:00:48,939 --> 03:00:49,860
[SPEAKER_14]: Jamie, your final thought.

2193
03:00:49,920 --> 03:00:51,942
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, I have to run errands, which kind of sucks.

2194
03:00:51,962 --> 03:00:52,562
[SPEAKER_14]: Jamie, your final thought.

2195
03:00:54,104 --> 03:00:54,204
[SPEAKER_14]: Um...

2196
03:00:56,485 --> 03:00:57,025
[SPEAKER_14]: Nevada.

2197
03:00:59,908 --> 03:01:00,328
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2198
03:01:01,789 --> 03:01:03,851
[SPEAKER_14]: Now you're not going to have a final word.

2199
03:01:04,351 --> 03:01:05,492
[SPEAKER_14]: So I have to give the final words.

2200
03:01:05,512 --> 03:01:06,072
[SPEAKER_14]: I have another one.

2201

2221
03:06:25,070 --> 03:06:25,911
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you getting back into that?

2222
03:06:26,311 --> 03:06:27,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I may as well.

2223
03:06:27,992 --> 03:06:28,773
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still paying for it.

2224
03:06:29,313 --> 03:06:31,875
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, Episode 4 is being beta tested right now.

2225
03:06:32,255 --> 03:06:32,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, joy.

2226
03:06:32,976 --> 03:06:34,977
[SPEAKER_14]: And apparently the card thing is gone.

2227
03:06:35,177 --> 03:06:36,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Good, because the card thing was retarded.

2228
03:06:37,539 --> 03:06:38,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god.

2229
03:06:38,820 --> 03:06:40,481
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this whole card craze thing?

2230
03:06:41,542 --> 03:06:41,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Ugh.

2231
03:06:42,483 --> 03:06:42,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Horrible.

2232
03:06:45,339 --> 03:06:45,839
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I agree.

2233
03:06:47,841 --> 03:06:48,161
[SPEAKER_14]: I agree.

2234
03:06:48,542 --> 03:06:49,602
[SPEAKER_14]: The card thing was not good.

2235
03:06:50,063 --> 03:06:53,305
[SPEAKER_14]: But we talked about that a little bit on Outside the Box a couple weeks ago.

2236
03:06:54,406 --> 03:06:54,766
[SPEAKER_14]: Interesting.

2237
03:06:56,047 --> 03:06:57,328
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, any exciting plans for the week?

2238
03:06:59,550 --> 03:06:59,750
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

2239
03:07:02,513 --> 03:07:02,973
[SPEAKER_14]: Very nice.

2240
03:07:03,894 --> 03:07:05,855
[SPEAKER_14]: Angel, you got any exciting plans this week?

2241
03:07:05,895 --> 03:07:06,736
[SPEAKER_14]: Y'all are pretty boring.

2242
03:07:10,139 --> 03:07:11,019
[SPEAKER_18]: Nah, not really.

2243
03:07:11,219 --> 03:07:13,081
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe play some more video games.

2244
03:07:13,921 --> 03:07:14,562
[SPEAKER_18]: Like I always do.

2245
03:07:16,934 --> 03:07:18,495
[SPEAKER_14]: Man, what do you people do for fun?

2246
03:07:19,375 --> 03:07:20,115
[SPEAKER_14]: I want Boba.

2247
03:07:21,156 --> 03:07:21,556
[SPEAKER_14]: You what?

2248
03:07:21,716 --> 03:07:22,236
[SPEAKER_14]: I want Boba.

2249
03:07:23,637 --> 03:07:29,119
[SPEAKER_14]: I hella want Boba, but I can't go out for Boba tonight because I have errands to run.

2250
03:07:29,179 --> 03:07:32,060
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to get up at 5.30 in the morning.

2251
03:07:32,541 --> 03:07:33,781
[SPEAKER_14]: Boba sounds like a good time, though.

2252
03:07:33,801 --> 03:07:34,281
[SPEAKER_14]: It really does.

2253
03:07:36,962 --> 03:07:38,063
[SPEAKER_14]: Darn you for bringing it up.

2254
03:07:41,556 --> 03:07:42,657
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh well, what can you do?

2255
03:07:44,037 --> 03:07:45,598
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, well, I guess that's it.

2256
03:07:45,678 --> 03:07:47,820
[SPEAKER_14]: Unless anybody else has anything exciting they want to add?

2257
03:07:49,721 --> 03:07:49,961
[SPEAKER_14]: No?

2258
03:07:50,161 --> 03:07:50,781
[SPEAKER_14]: Alrighty then.

2259
03:07:51,542 --> 03:07:54,123
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to go back to our Bomani Music and More program.

2260
03:07:55,024 --> 03:07:58,446
[SPEAKER_14]: Commercial free tonight, boys and girls, for a little while after the show.

2261
03:07:58,806 --> 03:08:03,689
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to start it off, though, with something special for those of you guys that stuck around, because I know a lot of you guys ditch us before the...

2262
03:08:05,106 --> 03:08:12,129
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I want to play something kind of new, because it's new and desirable by people, because you don't get to hear it a whole lot.

2263
03:08:12,509 --> 03:08:19,272
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're actually going to play that new remix, which we haven't really played a whole lot here on the station.

2264
03:08:19,692 --> 03:08:21,553
[SPEAKER_14]: So some of you guys may actually not have heard it yet.

2265
03:08:21,853 --> 03:08:23,474
[SPEAKER_14]: You know the Junk Circuit mix of I Feel?

2266
03:08:23,994 --> 03:08:24,574
[SPEAKER_14]: You remember that one?

2267
03:08:24,594 --> 03:08:28,196
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to play that for you guys, who stuck around for us.

2268
03:08:28,356 --> 03:08:29,396
[SPEAKER_14]: And have a great night, everybody.

2269
03:08:29,576 --> 03:08:31,177
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for tuning in and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.

2270
03:08:31,417 --> 03:08:31,777
[SPEAKER_14]: Have a good one.

2271
03:08:34,312 --> 03:08:35,072
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you feel it?

2272
03:08:35,252 --> 03:08:35,933
Do you feel it?
