Of course.

68
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,360
I brought another minigame, because I'm an addict.

69
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,360
Another minigame?

70
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,360
Oh, the McDonald's minigames.

71
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,520
Did we ever end up talking about that last week?

72
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,520
Yeah, we did.

73
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,520
A little bit?

74
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,520
Yeah, we did.

75
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,040
So you can see where my attention is when it comes to this show.

76
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,040
I can't remember anything.

77
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,040
I don't know why I got it.

78
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,040
I was like, hey, they still have them.

79
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,040
Okay, what the hell?

80
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:41,000

So definitely some interesting stuff going on for us here locally

83
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:52,260
But as for those you guys abroad and the rest of the nation in the world, things are boring for you. What can I say?

84
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,760

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,880
like it works for me

98
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:38,040
we're gonna kick it off with a song that was in two different balmani games

99
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,560

100
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:43,620

In your love

114
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:53,620
You can see to my eye, what you're feeling inside, and it feels the same in my eyes.

115
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,580
If you dance on your soul, then you try to relieve

116
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,300
Never run till your heart's in motion

117
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,420
Feel it, feel it, baby

118
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:05,460
Feel the fire, it's burning deep inside me

119
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:08,900

120
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,900
Promise it to you

00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:14,180
Dance to the heartbeat, whoa

122
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:17,060
You better take your turn, turn right now

123
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:20,580
Dance to the heartbeat and let it go

124
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,300
Keep the power down and you'll find it strong

125
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,300
Listen to the heartbeat

126
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,300
Whoa-oh-oh

127
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:29,300
You better think this is the time now

128
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,300
Listen to the heartbeat

129
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,300
And let it go

130
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,300
You can follow that and just let it go

131
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:17,740
A

132
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:44,300
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

133
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:49,060
We are back here on Orange Lawns Radio, episode number 122. Thank you guys for tuning in tonight.

134
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:53,740
We do appreciate your support, as always. Some Eurobeat music in that break, just for

135
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:56,860
you guys. Because you guys seem to dig that during the pre-show. At least those of you

136
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:03,100
guys that spoke up in our chat room, www.orangelawnsradio.com. And if you didn't like that, well, you need

137
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,920
to go back into chat and let us know so that the rest of the chat room can yell at you

138
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:11,820
appropriately. Because that's what they'll do. I'd like to be the first to say I didn't

139
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:16,820
like that. If you thought that break was bad, wait till you see the next break. I already

140
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:22,120
have the music queued up for the next break. Tonight, the goal is to drive you all crazy,

141
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,560
because, you know, it is the holiday time, and this is the time of year when everybody

142
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:30,460
goes, we'll be crazy. So, you know, just thought we'd get some appropriate music to match that,

143
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:37,640
so we'll see. And at some point tonight, Silent Hill, I promise, because it is the season.

144
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,760
We'll do, you know what we'll do? We'll do like a Silent Hill break. I'll play both remixes

145
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:46,880
of Silent Hill and then, like, your reign. You need to play both versions of Silent Hill

146
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:52,880
and then that one song by Roman Holly that was in Dancing Stage. Oh! That's a Christmas

147
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:58,920
song, too. If I can find it. We need to hear You're Not Here. Can I put that song on repeat

148
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:03,280
four times in my car on the way here? We'll definitely do You're Not Here a little later.

149
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:08,120
Remember when Para Para, or Para Para, however you like to say it, Para Para Para? Para Para.

150
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:13,720
and that used to be cool. It seems like the subject comes up at least once a month on

151
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:18,640
this show. When Para Para was cool. Okay, wait a minute. I remember when we all met

152
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:24,760
at MIGL when they first got it and I only knew how to do half of the Para Para. So I

153
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:28,960
tried. I remember tutorial mode in Second Mix and I taught myself how to do it. And

154
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,960
I tried to learn the Mickey Mouse March, which we heard in that break there. The Mickey Mouse

155
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:37,200
March is freaking hard. Freaking hard! Oh my god. And the DeltaDance.com is hard. I

156
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,500
I think I'm, no, I never learned that one.

157
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,940
No, you were watching when I tried to learn that one in Stockton.

158
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:46,980
I, now, Loki sits here and bashes on Para Para, but I remember when he used to break

159
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:50,460
out his white boy freestyle to some Para Para songs.

160
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:55,260
Yeah, that was back in the day when I was doing knee drops on DDR, I've come a long

161
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,260
way since then.

162
00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:00,900
Dude, I remember how happy I was when I learned how to do deluxe.

163
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,580
I get to go out there and shake my ass.

164
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,060
I love doing deluxe, but I-

165
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:06,660
No, you were funny doing Like A Virgin.

166
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:13,660
Like A Virgin was like the second Para Para I ever learned. I remember living at the Bhumani Bhumani house.

167
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,660
But did everyone learn Boom Boom Fire first?

168
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,660
You remember the Bhumani house years ago, right?

169
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,660
Yes.

170
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,660
I should say Bhumani Drama house.

171
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:22,660
Bhumani Drama house, to say the least.

172
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:26,660
You know, different times, what can you say?

173
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:33,660
But I remember when the house got Para Para, and that was like the first one I made myself sit down and learn.

174
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:38,140
I'd already learned Boom Boom Fire, but I was like, it's got a Madonna connection.

175
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,900
As a gay man, I have to learn this dance.

176
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,180
And it wasn't really.

177
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,700
It's actually kind of challenging.

178
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,460
I still barely remember it to this day.

179
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:54,660
Well, I know that my first one that I learned was actually Eurobeat, which was really easy.

180
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,860
And then I learned, I tried to learn Speedway.

181
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:01,380
But Boom Boom Fire was my third one.

182
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:07,340
And then when we had the five-song chorus, I learned how to do... Night of Fire was

183
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,340
my second one.

184
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,340
That was it.

185
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,340
Remember Sexy, Sexy, Sexy?

186
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,340
I know.

187
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,340
That was awesome.

188
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:15,700
But I wanted to learn, when we were still playing, I wanted to learn O Sole Mio, and

189
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,700
I never did.

190
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,700
Just because the little walk where you'd fan your ass.

191
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,220
You know what I'm talking about.

192
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,220
You said-

193
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:24,340
O Sole Mio, I just farted.

194
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:29,140
Well, you do your hand to one side, and then you do your other hand back like the I'm the

195
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:35,500
a little teacup dance except you're fanning your ass as you move forward. It's like, my

196
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:41,660
ass is on fire! Put me out! Most people who play Para Para probably have

197
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:48,420
an ass on fire. That was a good one. You're welcome, anytime. It's little observations

198
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:52,580
like that that make this show worth it, you know. Yeah, you're so not PC. I remember that

199
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:57,020
was really the first time we ever hung out, I think, that I met you was that whole trip.

200
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:06,220
And then we went on to Ziggle, and Enrique was with us, and we both got our crappy freestyle

201
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:13,820
on fourth mix, and somehow or another, we ended up doing a complete mirror of each other,

202
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:17,260
and decided we were gonna be all rad and did knee drops on the last thing, but it was like

203
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,260
the two knee one.

204
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,260
It was to...

205
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:23,780
Shoot, what was the song that everybody hated from third mix?

206
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,500
Was that the guy that always did the Buell dance?

207
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,500
Yeah.

208
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,940
you're okay

209
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,020
that uh...

210
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:32,580
white and he had a song and i think the broadband sound dancing

211
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,940
but we ended up i'd back-to-back

212
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,460
at the same time it was people

213
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,220
it was like oh my god

214
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:41,300
whatever happened to that guy

215
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,420
really

216
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,420
and six months ago or something

217
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,180
who's like hi

218
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:48,900

220
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,860

221
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,500
he was cool

222
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:59,000
You remember that guy at that one place here locally that did that thing? He was awesome.

223
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Anyway,

224
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,060
we're getting a little off track. We have to start off the show as we start off

225
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,940

00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:08,060

00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:46,360
I get paid like Wednesday, so I have to wait until after payday to buy presents for people.

249
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,760
I'm just a procrastinator. I'm not going to be buying any presents until Christmas Eve.

250
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:55,280
My whole week was nothing but school and working my ass off at the gym. Oh, I love my dad so

251
00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:02,160
much. Wow, these are so cool. And they have apples with needles in them.

252
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:08,280
The perfect Halloween treat. Oh my God, I love this outfit. I would wear

253
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,280

And you know what we got? Me and Tia won a game, you know, one of the mini-games, and we got Daisy Boo.

274
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:10,780
Now, Princess Peach is still a playable character, right? Thank God, because

275
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:13,700
I always play Princess Peach. I throw a fit if I can't be Peach.

276
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:18,140
You want to be the pretty princess.

277
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,500
Because I love when she does that,

278
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,640
Peach is the winner! thing, and she flips her hair.

279
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,100
We need to move the chatroom over the

280
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:35,820
webcam again. But anyway, we were trying to decide what to eat, so we kept talking about

281
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:45,220
fish tacos. And we couldn't get off of the subject about eating fish tacos.

282
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:50,380
How exactly do a bunch of women in Islander hanging out together prepare fish tacos?

283
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:59,340
we were just it just came up but a bunch of women hanging out preparing fish

284
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:05,780
tacos anyway it made me think about that time we went to the elephant barn I

285
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:09,660
ordered fish tacos and you laughed about it I did I giggled like a half hour

286
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:13,220
straight I am so immature but you know what I know our listeners are mature

287
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:17,500
tour because I'm looking at the chat room right now it's everybody is making

288
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:24,500
I was referring to burning heat, but burning heat can also refer to ass-quirking.

289
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:54,500
14 moons. If one doesn't bathe or something. Anyway. Flash in the ass. My week, my day.

290
00:23:55,100 --> 00:24:01,100
Hello. I have things to do. Sorry, I was just preoccupied. Drifting asses. Ass. Rob. What?

291
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:08,100
Do you like the ass? Ass master. There's something in the air tonight. It's a little too much

292
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:16,740
eggnog going around for everybody, I think. Dude, I had alcohol, even a little bit, even

293
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:21,000
when you cook all the alcohol out I still react to it like giggly and it's

294
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:30,160
gonna I cooked tonight too oh yeah back to last night um stop reading the chat

295
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:34,280
room they're too immature tonight they don't deserve that all right well we

296
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:38,560
could we just like could not decide on what to eat so finally Ross is all we're

297
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,560
We're just going to do a hometown buffet.

298
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,560
Ew!

299
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,560
So we went to like the...

300
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:49,560
I've been to a couple of different hometown buffets and they were all kind of okay, you know.

301
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,560
We went to the one on the ass end of White Avenue.

302
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:56,560
And I literally do mean the ass end. It's like up there by Walmart.

303
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:00,560
Which to anybody who's not in this area has no idea what you're talking about.

304
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,560
It's like the ghetto side of it.

305
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:08,920
If anyone has ever been in Sacramento, if you're going up past where McClellan was,

306
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,920
it's up in the ass.

307
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,400
So basically you went to a hometown buffet in the ghetto.

308
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,400
Yes.

309
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,400
Okay.

310
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,800
And there were people there saying, nah, after this we're gonna go get some entertainment

311
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,800
over at Wal-Mart.

312
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,800
Okay, whatever.

313
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:26,000
So, uh, I ate a bunch of food, it was yummy, of the Temple of Butt.

314
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Oh no, I'm sorry.

315
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Stop reading chat!

316
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Stop.

317
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I command you.

318
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Bite me?

319
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Mmm, potato.

320
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Oh, that's what happens when you cook food, it gets hot.

321
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Oh, okay, I hate to acknowledge chat, but this one is really winner. Captain Jack Ass.

322
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Ha!

323
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Get it?

324
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Ha ha!

325
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Sorry.

326
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I was the ass.

327
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,040
Alright, I'm gonna start kicking people, making ass comments. We need to get the show back

328
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:55,000
on track. We're not gonna just sit here and say ass for 3 hours straight tonight. What?

329
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Get on ass, Loudstyle.

330
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Okay, week, week, day. Hometown buffet.

331
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Yeah, so we came back, watched Rejected, and Hedvig, and I am a banana.

332
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
What?

333
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:18,000
My Rejected DVD was part of the settlement in my last relationship.

334
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I made out with a third style, fourth style, and a DDR pad, and he made out with the Rejected DVD, so it was a fair trade.

335
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:33,000
We watched Rejected, and then we watched Hedwig and the Angry Inch, and I love that movie.

336
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,000
And then I went home. And then today, I sat on my ass and did nothing.

337
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Well, okay, I went to the grocery store to buy cream, and Dan's like,

338
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Burn me some ice cream!

339
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Okay...

340
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
So he sat around watching Return of the King, which I don't want to watch,

341
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
because I think Gollum is, like, retarded and...

342
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
There is something weird about that guy.

343
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Who's creepy?

344
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,520
Well, of course, he's meant to be creepy, but he's, like, actually turned to my stomach.

345
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,600
Although, I did manage to peek down for some of the Legolas scenes, so that was cool.

346
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,600
I was like, ooh, Elfman.

347
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:09,480
And, uh, so I came up here early before the show, about the time pre-show started, and

348
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,480
I cooked.

349
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,280
Yes, you did.

350
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:19,920
I made these kebabs with, uh, shrimp and scallops topped with lobster tail.

351
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:29,720
And I made green beans, cooked in butter and herbs, with cream sauce to coat.

352
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,360
And I'm actually putting the recipe for the cream sauce in my live journal.

353
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:36,760
For anyone who goes to the live journal, only my friends can see it, so you're the lucky

354
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,760
few.

355
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,280
Well, you could always put it in the Orange Lounge community, because the Orange Lounge

356
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,280
community needs something.

357
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,280
I don't like them.

358
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,280
Why?

359
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,280
Are you kidding?

360
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,280
Rare.

361
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,640
I'll let someone else repost it for me.

362
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:52,640
basically I made this amaretto cream sauce to go over it cuz you know

363
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:58,460
normally when I make green beans... wait, wait, wait, amaretto... okay sorry had to have a moment

364
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:02,620
normally when I make green beans I go for like the Italian style spicy or I'll

365
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:07,720
do a Cajun style I went for sweet cream this time and I had garlic in it

366
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:13,680
Jamie let her let me eat her sweet cream and it was good but I had garlic in it

367
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:20,280
and some pepper and amaretto and butter and cream and there's a lot of

368
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:26,400
ingredients in Jamie's sweet cream okay whatever um but I am like this I like

369
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,680
just pulled this recipe right out of my ass and it tended to be really good I

370
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:34,320
keep saying what is with the ass fixation with you people tonight everybody

371
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,180
gay this is my normal phrasing okay and the

372
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:42,480
The chat room is imitating me. Pay me some rent, bitches.

373
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:47,480
I love you guys. A little.

374
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,480
I'm done.

375
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,480
Oh, you're done?

376
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,480
Yeah, I'm done.

377
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,240
Wait, but whatever happened? There were no fun stories about Hometown Buffet? You kind

378
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,240
of glossed right over there?

379
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,320
No, the people scared me there. They're like the guy in painter overalls with the beer

380
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,320
belly.

381
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,320
You know, I heard that there were-

382
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,320
He was pregnant.

383
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,360
I heard that there were, there are people out there that will go to Hometown Buffet

384
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:07,040
in the morning and then stay there all day long.

385
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:10,360
I think they have a policy where they kick them out because they have to change

386
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:14,200
the dinners and everything in between. Well, that's the smart thing to do.

387
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:19,160
Can you imagine that? One of these nights where we have to go to the buffet over at

388
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,160
Thunder Valley.

389
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,480
That is a good buffet.

390
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:27,080
You know what? It's a little slice of Vegas right here in our backyard. We need to do that like right before,

391
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,920
we need to do that on

392
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,840
the night before New Years Eve.

393
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,360
Do like the Orange Lounge, bring the tape recorder.

394
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,480
We could do something like that.

395
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:39,280
We should do that. It's like pre-New Year's Eve, eat a whole bunch of sugar

396
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:44,400
a thon. Alright, sounds good. Alright, I'm done. Alright, uh, Loki!

397
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:48,140
Okay, Loki's eating, so we're gonna go to Angel. Angel, how was your week, how was your day?

398
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:52,020
I played a little bit of Imani this week, uh, 7th style,

399
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,400
just cause I haven't bought 8th style yet.

400
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,320
But, uh, I kinda gave up after, like, a couple songs, cause

401
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:01,660
my controller's being a bit of a pain in the butt.

402
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,320
Honestly, like, it's just

403
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:10,320
the king

404
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:14,520
and uh... also i found a new korean game addiction

405
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,700
probably talk about later because

406
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:21,840
i don't know if you guys in the state

407
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:27,080
it okay the only thing i'm gonna give away for now is

408
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,880
that it's a mix between like

409
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,160
right now

410
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:34,860
uh... meets final fantasy meets commander keane

411
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:37,760
and i'll tell you right now i aint leaving final fantasy 4 because i

412
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,060

00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,360

414
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:45,360

00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:51,000

00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:02,640
in my account i think it's hell no

422
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,560
didn't answer that much she's on level what

423
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,920
and i think the three months

424
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:16,840
you know i'm teasing

425
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,280
and then i got files

426
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:23,780
other than that no school yay

427
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,660
look here it is not

428
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:30,660
You got enough potato down where you can talk here? Starchy? How was your week? How was your day?

429
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:35,660
This is my really starchy, really full of sodium meal.

430
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:38,660
That's really good for me, I'm sure.

431
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:42,660
Anyways, how'd this week go? Oh yeah.

432
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,660
First window to a funeral. That was fun.

433
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,660
Got to see lots of family, but there was ham, so that was good.

434
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:57,380
And then, you talking about ham makes me think of this thing that was in the Christmas present

435
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:03,500
that you got me. Did I tell you about this? I'll talk about it later. After the kids go

436
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:13,300
to bed later in the show. God. Anyways, so then after that, let's see, Wednesday I didn't

437
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:19,940
do anything. Thursday I took the day off to take my car down to get the brakes fixed.

438
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:28,060
That was wonderful because it's done now. Play lots of Final Fantasy. It's going to

439
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:34,420
work on the cabinet. I actually did work on the cabinet and my DDR pads create too much

440
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:41,460
SAC electricity and it ends up trying or temporarily shorting out the IPAC every time I use them

441
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:44,540
So I got to modify them again

442
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:48,420
Slightly hopefully and hopefully that'll fix it

443
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,780
if not

444
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,940
Gotta Chuck them that makes me sad

445
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,340
but um

446
00:32:55,340 --> 00:33:01,620
yeah, so I worked on that and lots of Final Fantasy and I had to make cookies for

447
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:08,100
tomorrow at work because our boss volunteered us you had to make cookies

448
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:12,700
or your mom had to make cookies I had to make cookies

449
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:20,580
it's just cookies it's not like you toss them no I did not toss the cookies no so

450
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:25,100
yeah he volunteered us to do this thing and none of us wanted to do it and then

451
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:31,580
he's like yeah we'll do it as a team but I'm not gonna do it so you know what

452
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:36,860
I ended up having to make cookies, and they looked like nipples.

453
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,820
And, um,

454
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:41,660
I also sold some other cookies for my mom's house.

455
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:45,300
And, uh, there's some that look like croissants that are pretty good.

456
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,940
And, um,

457
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:53,940
I ate all the butter cookies that she had. She gave me. So, oh, so good.

458
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:58,980
Oh, and I saw Blade Trinity yesterday, and that was good.

459
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:02,980
I just didn't really care anymore, but Ryan Reynolds made it funny.

460
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:05,760
Because Wesley Snipes, just, eh.

461
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:12,260
But Ryan Reynolds being a jackass, that's good.

462
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:15,660
Ryan Reynolds, this is Alanis Morissette's fiancé.

463
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:20,400
I did, how sad is that? Alright, anyway. You're the resident Alanis, man. I totally am.

464
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:25,520
That was the music I was listening to before, but money. And still, really. I mean, I can't listen to DDR music 24-7.

465
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,300
I don't know how some people out there do that. And I know it's ironic, considering

466
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:32,500
the radio station that we do, but even in the radio station we do, I think we have enough

467
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:37,000
diversions away from the normal playlist where even if you listen to our station 24-7, you

468
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,740
wouldn't be hearing Bomani 24-7. I like listening to other music once in a while. We can hear

469
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:45,620
a lot of that randomness on Jamie's show. If you ever wondered, why does Jamie's show

470
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:50,500
exist on a video gaming network when she plays complete random stuff, that's why. Because

471
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:54,700
you can't listen to gaming music 24-7, I'm sorry. You gotta appreciate the other music

472
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:58,200
it's out there once in a while so Jamie is your music appreciation here I'm

473
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,600
gonna murder everybody with a whole bunch of your beat just like with all

474
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:07,000
the gamers once in a while you need to go outside anyway my week of idea was

475
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:12,080
pretty good I just played a lot of Final Fantasy myself I I went out last night I

476
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:15,640
went out to the bar which is good it was the first time that my buddy since you've

477
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:19,480
been out of the hospital got to go we had a good time I drank a little bit and

478
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:23,320
met some people I like it when strangers randomly come up and talk to me and

479
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:27,000
There was this girl there who was just like Karen from Will and Grace and that made me

480
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,200
love her because, you know, I love Karen on that show.

481
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,680
If you guys watch Will and Grace, you know it's all about Karen on that show.

482
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,160
I don't even know if I know who you're talking about.

483
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,040
See, he knows what I'm talking about.

484
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,680
And then, you know, I've been doing a lot of stuff at work.

485
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,000
I've been busy, busy at work and it's kind of funny you talk about your boss making you

486
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,560
all do this, you know, cooking thing because we're doing something similar in my work right

487
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:48,960
now where, you know, we're doing all these winter events and you have to be politically

488
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,960
correct.

489
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,640
You can't say Christmas stuff.

490
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:55,880
holiday stuff you know so we had a holiday ornament decoration contest that

491
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:59,680
everybody had to participate well you didn't have to but you know everybody

492
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:04,280
was supposed to participate in and I was so busy teaching because that's why I do

493
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:08,520
it my job I teach I was so busy that I did not have a chance to decorate my

494
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:12,240
ornament until about two minutes before so what I did is I printed out a picture

495
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,720
of SpongeBob SquarePants face from the internet and then I pasted it on the

496
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,960
ornament and colored it in yellow highlighter and it looked pretty it was

497
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:23,860
a spongebob ornament. It was awesome. And people liked it though. So, you know, I get

498
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:29,100
points for that. And tomorrow I have to decorate my cube, so. What can I say? What is this

499
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:34,100
you're showing in LiveJournal right now? Kitty. It's a puppy! Oh, it's a puppy? It looks like

500
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:39,260
a kitty from back here. It's a shellty. Oh, okay. Thank you for totally derailing this

501
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:44,860
segment. Oh, it's so cute! Uh, also earlier this week I picked up Final Fantasy Dawn of

502
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:48,780
Souls, which is Final Fantasy I and II on the Game Boy Advance, and I can't stop playing

503
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:51,960
it. I haven't even touched Final Fantasy II yet. I've just been playing Final Fantasy

504
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:57,540
I because they totally redid it. They made the battle system more like IV and just everything

505
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:01,780
is more like Final Fantasy IV but, you know, with Final Fantasy I's story and it's awesome.

506
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:05,680
I highly recommend it if you're a Final Fantasy fan. And the great part is, I will sit there

507
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:11,580
and while I wait for a party in Final Fantasy XI, I'll play Final Fantasy I on my DS. So,

508
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:17,740
I'm just a total Final Fantasy whore lately. But that's okay. I'm allowed. Alright. So

509
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:23,100
that's pretty much my week of my day so we're gonna move right along here you

510
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:26,620
know what's going on tonight right now actually right now and I hate talking

511
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:30,740
about reasons for you to leave orange lounge radio because you should be

512
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:35,660
listening to our show you know all the time however this is as good of excuse

513
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:38,900
as any I figure if you've got to go I mean this is this would be something I

514
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:42,140
would want to listen to do mini head you know we had him on the show a couple

515
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:46,100
weeks ago he's doing a live spinning thing right now where he's debuting some

516
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:50,480
new material and stuff, it's actually going on right now over on www.midihead.com. I'm

517
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:54,500
trying to work out something where maybe we can play it later, so I'm hoping I can hear

518
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:59,140
it a little later, but, you know, if you're a fan of Midihead and he's a great guy, I

519
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:03,220
know there's a lot of fans out there, you probably would want to check that out at some

520
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:08,620
point, but, you know, I'll be sad if you leave. But no, you gotta support all internet radio,

521
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,620
so, you know.

522
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,620
Probably.

523
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:13,700
Do what you gotta do. No, you're not leaving, Loki. You're stuck. You're under contract.

524
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:14,700
Contract?

525
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:26,140
alright yeah it's it's a contract sealed with blood you get paid in meat all

526
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:31,220
right um we're gonna go to a break when we come back from the break we'll talk

527
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:34,660
about some more stuff going on the Bahmani scene I want to take a call over

528
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:37,820
sky is actually a couple calls I want to do over Skype tonight but I've got one I

529
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:41,940
want to do right when we come back somebody said something very interesting

530
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:48,340
in our chat room. And it has to do with remixes. And it has to do with you, Loki. I'm going

531
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:51,860
to have him call in and talk about that when we come back from this break. In this break,

532
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:56,060
I promised a fun theme. We're going to do happy music. And this is a lot of happy music

533
00:38:56,060 --> 00:39:01,660
that was suggested to us by folks in the chat room. No happy music. Yes, happy music. We'll

534
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:08,660
We'll be back.

535
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:33,660
Oh

536
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:23,660

538
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:33,160
Say, you know you gotta try a little harder

539
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:36,660
So you can be my, my, my, my darlin'

540
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:39,660

And just have a good time

542
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,160

A little bit of love and gonna feel so fine

545
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:51,660
Is it really true to feel the same way too?

546
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:56,660
And hope we'll be together now

547
00:41:56,660 --> 00:42:04,660
You know that I love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you

548
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:07,660
When I'm feeling sinking up

549
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:10,660
A funny word we call love

550
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:13,660
Still don't think of you as it burns

551
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:16,660
Most time a lizard comes above

552
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:19,660
If you wanna capture me

553
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:22,660
It's as simple as can be

554
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:32,660
Michelin has said it, all you need is

555
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:38,660
Love, my love, my love, my love, my love

556
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:40,660
Oh

557
00:44:38,660 --> 00:45:00,060
Which I?

558
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:05,060
No, no, nobody does, no, nobody does, can't save me

559
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:07,060
Bye baby balloon

560
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:13,060
Bye, bye baby balloon

561
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:17,060
Bitch, get a new song

562
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:20,060
An open letter from Orange Lounge Radio

563
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:22,060
We are back here on Orange Lou-

564
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:23,060
Whoops, no we're not, there we are

565
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:26,060
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio

566
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:28,060
Yeah, that was the very first promo

567
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:34,700
a promo, I think. Me and the ex actually did that one. That was, you can hear the ex singing

568
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:41,620
in that one. I refused to participate in that one. No sing-along for Jimmy. I did do the

569
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:49,620
solitary voice. I remember we came up with that one in your car. Yep, I remember that

570
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:53,820
one in the, I'll play the other one later. There was another one we came up with too.

571
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:56,940
it was really all you. Actually it was Dan, really.

572
00:45:56,940 --> 00:46:05,860
Yeah, the take on me one. Yeah, we'll get that in a little later.

573
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:10,660
Alright, during the break there, Loki was booting up Stepmania because he wanted to

574
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:14,660
show me some dancing characters in Stepmania. I guess there's some new characters that hit

575
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:19,140
the internet this week. What's going on with Stepmania's dancing characters? I didn't think

576
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:21,620
there was a scene for character creation, but apparently there is.

577
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:35,620
Well, there's some funny ones. Vivi from Final Fantasy IX was in there as one of the dancing characters, and a really crappy done Maria from, was it Silent Hill 3, is it? It doesn't look like Maria, but whatever.

578
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:45,620
Anyway, so those are available. I can't remember where they are, though, because the link was on DDArmaniaX, but that site's been down for a few days now.

579
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:55,620
But they're out there. God, I can't remember... I don't know. It's a site that has a bunch of stuff on there. They did a bunch of...

580
00:46:55,620 --> 00:47:06,620
Oh, crap, I can't remember. It's the same site that hosts all the official ones. They have one that the guy has been ripping them from 5th Mix and 3rd Mix now. It's that site that hosts those, that's where you can find those two.

581
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:12,620
But, um, yeah, I was also showing Rob, uh, there's an older one I got a while back, uh, Master Chief from Halo.

582
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:15,620
That one was rad. That one was cool.

583
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:19,420
makes the Master Chief look so fruity because he's like swinging his arms around going,

584
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:25,140
woo, I'm dancing. And the song that Loki was playing was some sim file for I'm Your Bogeyman

585
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:29,340
by Xtreme. And like he just picks up the Master Chief going, woo, I'm your boogeyman, I'm

586
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:34,980
your boogeyman. This is a really amazing image. But the VV one was really good. That was pretty,

587
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:39,920
I mean, it's not perfect, but it's hilarious. Like it gets the job done. It's fun to watch.

588
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:44,300
So definitely check that out. If anybody in our chat room happens to know where those

589
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:48,900
those characters are hosted. Feel free to post it in chat. Again, it was on DDR Maniacs,

590
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:57,980
but, but, um, they're down there. We had a little, uh, glitch there on Live 365. Comcast

591
00:47:57,980 --> 00:48:01,740
Party. What we're gonna do, I don't know if it was Comcast. No, I don't think it was that.

592
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:06,340
I just think it was a station part. We're gonna go to a quick break, just to make sure

593
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:09,500
folks have a chance to reconnect. I hate it when that stuff happens. We'll be right back

594
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:16,500
back after this guys.

595
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:59,500
Are you ready to dance to the night that you did it to my heart it was right there

596
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:04,500
Sure you need your magic, under the moonlight

597
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:08,500
Bounds of lights, of bloody people

598
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:11,500
Love what's me, I don't know why

599
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:14,500
Do the next and this move to the felt

600
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:17,500
And what is what you need?

601
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:20,500
Monkey dance, monkey dance

602
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:23,500
Make a star, shake it, pull it down

603
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:26,500
Step on the monkey dance, blast it together

604
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:29,500
Hold the fire, baby

605
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:32,500
Monkey dance, monkey dance

606
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:35,500
Like we shall move your body down

607
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,500
Step on the monkey dance

608
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:38,500
Look at that tail

609
00:49:38,500 --> 00:50:04,500
We are back here on Orange Launch Radio, sorry about that, we had some kind of station hiccup,

610
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:05,500
something happened.

611
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:10,260
It happens once in a while, Live 365 or something, there was a faulty connection between our

612
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:15,340
house and Live 365, either a hiccup on our end or a hiccup on their end.

613
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:20,260
I know Live 365 was doing a bunch of maintenance yesterday, so all the Live 365 stations were

614
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:21,260
down.

615
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:25,700
We were down, DDR Free Radio, On Your Station Live, all the Live 365 stations were down

616
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:26,700
yesterday.

617
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:32,700
So maybe something's going on with that, I don't know, but we do appear that we are back.

618
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:37,940
Remember, if you ever miss any or all of a show, any part, all, whatever, you can hear

619
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:43,900
the show in its entirety on DDR Freak Radio, Friday nights, 6 o'clock, Pacific Standard

620
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:47,340
Time is when that airs, but it's gonna be interesting though, I have no idea how that

621
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:51,940
hiccup is gonna translate into the archive. I think it just keeps right on going, so you'll

622
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:59,980
hear us going, crap, station down! All hands on deck! Weird, so I don't know what's going

623
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:08,980
Anyway, before we got dropped there, we were talking about new dancing characters in StepMania, and it looks like Loki found the site where he can actually get those dancing characters from, right?

624
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:15,980
Well, it's not this site. I thought it was the same site, but it doesn't look like it is. It was PlazmaDance.com was where some of them were.

625
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:25,980
Okay, so some of them are on there, PlazmaDance.com, so you can check that out if you are curious about it. Does it have the Master Chief? Because that's the one people really have to get.

626
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:26,980
No.

627
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:27,980
Oh, it doesn't?

628
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:29,980
Well, forget it then.

629
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:30,980
Don't waste your time.

630
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:31,980
I'm just kidding.

631
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:33,980
There's a lot of good ones on there though.

632
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:34,980
Alright.

633
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:35,980
Um.

634
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:36,980
Wow.

635
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:38,980
Trying to get back on track here.

636
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:39,980
Um.

637
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:40,980
Let's see.

638
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:45,060
What I wanted to do now is I wanted to actually go to the phones on the Skype line and if

639
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:51,100
you want to participate in the Skype line, just go to our website, www.orangelauntrader.com

640
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:56,460
and click on interact with us and it's got all the details on how you can actually interact

641
00:51:56,460 --> 00:52:01,940
with the program and actually there's a specific person I'm looking to hear from that I'm hoping

642
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:07,580
will be calling us in a minute here because he was talking about something in chat earlier

643
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:11,680
so we're going to open up the Skype line so he can get through. So I'm specifically looking

644
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:15,740
for the person I have a prearranged phone interview with so if you're somebody else

645
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:19,700
don't worry you'll have an opportunity to call on the show later. Hi you're on Orange

646
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:23,180
Hey, is my mic on?

647
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:27,860
Uh, you're, you're, you're fading out there a little bit. Make sure all your other transfers

648
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:32,780
and your bandwidth is open there. Can you hear us?

649
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:33,780
Hello.

650
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:34,780
Hello.

651
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:36,780
Hi.

652
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:37,780
Am I okay?

653
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:41,180
I think so. We'll just keep going with this. Who is this?

654
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:42,580
This is John Fields.

655
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:44,700
Hi, John Fields. How are you?

656
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:45,760
I'm doing fine.

657
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:49,580
All right. What did you call in to talk to us about tonight? By OC Remix. Uh, you know

658
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:56,580
you know what? right now

659
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:25,080
Yeah, that song's kinda fitting right now, a little gentle stress being caused by faulty internet connections.

660
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:27,080
We're gonna keep going with this as best we can, guys.

661
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:29,580
Uh, I don't know what to tell you, though, about that.

662
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:32,080
Um, I don't know if it's on our end.

663
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:35,580
I don't think it's on our end, because we haven't been having any internet problems for a long time now.

664
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:43,080
I know we used to have a lot of problems with internet here, but ever since the really cool tech guy came out, we haven't really been having problems, have we, Logie?

665
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:44,640
Now it's

666
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:49,680
Yeah, the real cool tech. I came out and just use pliers something I could have done in like three seconds

667
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:52,240
You know what the he thought of it and you didn't that's the point

668
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:56,200
Well, I can't help it if he's more experienced with their faulty equipment. Um,

669
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:01,940
So yeah. Anyway, again if you missed all our part you can always tune in to

670
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:07,480
And now we're having sound issues my god if enough stuff wouldn't break around here

671
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:14,480
Again, you can always tune into DDR Free Radio to hear the archive in full, along with other

672
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:17,800
live programming that goes on throughout the week here on Orange Launch Radio, which usually

673
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:19,580
doesn't get affected by this kind of stuff.

674
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:24,160
You can tune in to Pump Up The Volume on Tuesday nights, hosted by the lovely Dark Sacra.

675
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:30,560
Monday nights, Diversion, Orange Launch Radio, Bimani remixes, and Thursday nights, Outside

676
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:35,680
The Box, which will be in reruns this week, actually, because I'm going to be out this

677
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:36,680
week.

678
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:40,200
and about in LA. I'm actually going to LA this week. I was kind of hoping that I'd get

679
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:45,000
to go to Arcade Infinity while I was down in LA, but it doesn't look like that's going

680
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:50,280
to happen because me and four co-workers actually have to share a car. Doesn't that suck?

681
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:56,240
A tremendous amount of ass. However, there's a good noodle place over there by AI. You

682
00:55:56,240 --> 00:56:02,240
should just go in there for dinner. Maybe, I don't know. It's really a good place.

683
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:10,580
I'll have to see. All right, more to do. And we're still getting sound issues. This is

684
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:17,460
bad. I'm sorry, guys. Everything's breaking. We keep going down. We're going to call it

685
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:23,060
a show. I'm getting pretty pissy here. We'll see. We'll keep going best we can, though.

686
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:28,500
Let's go get sushi. Seriously? I'm like, food. All right, let's go to another break and just

687
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:32,320
Just kind of hope things are good when we come back and we'll try calling John again

688
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:35,620
and get out some more Bamani news and just, you know, keep doing what we do here.

689
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:38,320
So we'll be back after this little break here.

690
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:42,580
I think we'll do that Silent Hill break I was talking about earlier.

691
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:43,900
So we'll be back.

692
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,900
Happy Holidays to everybody out there.

693
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:22,900
Tonight is the night for our love yous

694
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:29,900
Wish we could have this evening

695
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:34,900
The year that Christmas is here

696
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:36,900
Christmas is here

697
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:52,900
Night falls on you

698
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:58,900
And if you want me near you

699
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:03,900
Oh, my Lord, see what you make

700
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:08,900
The night falls on you

701
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:11,900
Oh, my Lord, know my soul

702
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:13,900
The thoughts you fear

703
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:15,900
Your heart is strong

704
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:20,900
Christmas is here

705
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:52,900
It would be a much better fight, with you, with me

706
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:59,900
If you hadn't let me, I'd be fine on my own, baby

707
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:06,900
Never felt so lonely, never felt so alone

708
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:12,900
If you hadn't left me, I'd be fine on my own, baby

709
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:18,900
Never felt so lonely then you came along

710
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:21,900
So now what should I do?

711
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:24,900
I'm strung out, addicted to you

712
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:28,900
My body aches, now that you're gone

713
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:33,900
My supply fell through

714
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:38,400
Glad they gave me everything you had and more

715
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,900
You craved my happiness

716
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:43,400
When you made me feel joy in me

717
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:45,400
Just smile for now

718
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:47,400
I feel your stress

719
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:49,400
Love was never meant to be

720
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:52,400
Such a crazy affair, no

721
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:54,400
And who has time but you?

722
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,400
Never thought I'd sit around

723
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:00,400
And unravel your love

724
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:39,400
I love you drinking and toasting at such a special day

725
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:45,400
Tonight, nightfall, I love you

726
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:51,400
Wish we could have this evening

727
01:00:51,400 --> 01:01:00,400
Do you remember you? Christmas is here. Christmas is here.

728
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:16,400
Tonight, nightfall, I love you

729
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:25,400
And if you wouldn't need it, you would be my heart baby

730
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:33,400
But tonight's the night before I love you

731
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:37,400
No, I can't stop the fear

732
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:43,400
Are you calling Christmas is here?

733
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:51,400
We often wonder how some of those Bomani songs are chosen.

734
01:01:57,400 --> 01:02:01,400
One hit wonder, one hit wonder, one hit wonder, one hit wonder

735
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:04,400
One hit wonder, one hit wonder, one hit wonder

736
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:09,400
One hit wonder, one hit wonder, one hit wonder, one hit wonder, one hit wonder

737
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:14,400
We think we figured it out. Orange Lounge Radio.

738
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:17,400
Hi, we're back. And hopefully things are stable.

739
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:21,400
I think the internet is just completely fucked tonight, basically, is what it boils down to.

740
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:24,400
Because I notice people keep dropping from our chat room, left and right,

741
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:28,400
and the Skype chat a little bit earlier was really kind of freaky.

742
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:32,400
So we're under attack! The internet is screwed!

743
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:34,400
I don't know what's going on.

744
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,400
The internet's on vacation.

745
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:38,400
I cannot find anything on this damn game.

746
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:43,400
Of course, people in the chat room right now are bitching because we played Silent Hill twice in that break.

747
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:47,400
But, you know, it's Christmas. It's mandatory that we have to do that.

748
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:51,400
Just think, you'll go the whole rest of the year and you won't have to hear it again. Except for next week.

749
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:53,400
Alright, let's try this again. We're going to give Jon a call back.

750
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:57,400
Kind of start from the top, before people got booted before.

751
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:08,520
Hello? Hi, John, you there? Yep. Good, you sound a lot better this time. Okay, I think

752
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:15,120
the internet might be fixed. Okay. We'll see. Anyway, from the top. So, you're in the Overclocked

753
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:22,160
Remix channel this week. Yep. And you're asking about fusion mixes. Right, I was wondering

754
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:27,400
after all what came out today which was i believe another

755
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,920
before you remix or something like that

756
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:31,060
uh...

757
01:03:31,060 --> 01:03:34,400
i was wondering if maybe we could try getting out low keys are remixed in

758
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:37,880
there just for fun well first you've got to talk you've got to talk low key into

759
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:41,880
it because he's pretty protective over his material there

760
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:46,040
well i've spoken for the higher up today and uh...

761
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:49,840
hit the higher up is there no c hierarchy or something

762
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:54,120
The Trump of OC? Okay, no, I'm kidding.

763
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:56,140
Basically, what it is, is it's like

764
01:03:56,140 --> 01:03:59,940
most of the chat channel users are unvoiced

765
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:02,960
and the higher-ups are voiced.

766
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:04,120
And then there's

767
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:09,360
pretty much DJ Pretzel and then a couple of bots, I think, up at the top.

768
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:11,360
Okay, gotcha.

769
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:15,840
And I was on the voice today and

770
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:19,080
Aurora is the name.

771
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:25,160
I think she said that she would like us to try getting it in there.

772
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:28,700
Well, now how many DDR remixes are on OC Remix?

773
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:29,820
Not a lot, right?

774
01:04:29,820 --> 01:04:33,600
Yeah, it's like three or four right now, I think.

775
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:37,700
What'd he say, Loki? Oh, he's looking at the site right now.

776
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:40,780
He sizes it up.

777
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:45,580
There's a request for more Bimani, actually. There's a request for more Bimani.

778
01:04:45,580 --> 01:04:49,420
I'm moving the mic over to you. What do you think of this?

779
01:04:49,420 --> 01:04:52,140
I don't know.

780
01:04:52,140 --> 01:04:55,800
Now see, I like OC Remix. It's a good site. There's a lot of really good remixes on

781
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:58,260
there. I think it would be pretty exciting if you got it on there.

782
01:04:58,260 --> 01:05:00,220
And you know what? Yet again,

783
01:05:00,220 --> 01:05:02,100
you could just continue to kick

784
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:05,780
those people who say that Fusion remixes are not real remixes.

785
01:05:05,780 --> 01:05:09,500
I mean, not only did you get Midihead, who actually has a song in DDR on here a couple

786
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:10,620
weeks ago, saying

787
01:05:10,620 --> 01:05:13,620
he uses his ass in his mixes, but

788
01:05:13,620 --> 01:05:18,220
then you could get one of these mixes on oc remix and you would just

789
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:21,420
you would have the hugest internet penis i mean seriously

790
01:05:21,420 --> 01:05:23,020
almost as big as jason's

791
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:24,340
i don't think it would

792
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:26,120
fall i think under the fact

793
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:29,060
if i remember correctly i don't think it would be allowed

794
01:05:29,060 --> 01:05:36,060
actually

795
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:38,300
no i don't think

796
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:40,140
i don't think it would work

797
01:05:40,140 --> 01:05:43,700
you don't feel work because the fact that you mix that your songs with other

798
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:46,900
songs that are already out this year kind of using too much commercial music

799
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:49,600
is that what you think the problem is

800
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:52,980
yet copyright music

801
01:05:52,980 --> 01:05:54,420
i have no permission from

802
01:05:54,420 --> 01:05:56,500
original artist

803
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:59,680
yeah but i mean

804
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:03,700
there are songs on there that have remixed our life and thought i think uh...

805
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:07,040
i think there's like a jingle bells on their mixed with uh... super mario world

806
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:09,160
i think

807
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:12,440
ever jingle bells is uh... public domain

808
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:14,160
i think so

809
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:15,360
that maybe

810
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:18,340
even the happy birthday song is not public domain if you believe that you

811
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:20,620
know every time you think the happy birthday song is supposed to give some

812
01:06:20,620 --> 01:06:22,160
guy a quarter basically

813
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:25,480
well not really but you know happy birthdays a copyrighted song

814
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:27,160
look he's going to look into a john

815
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:28,860
that's mostly do for you

816
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:32,560
okay i'm i'm hoping i'm hoping he'll do it i think it would be good

817
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:36,240
all right i'm all for pouring out the show everywhere possible

818
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:38,260
you know thanks for looking out for so

819
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:44,740
keep us posted okay all right later bye bye our chat room is being a bunch of

820
01:06:44,740 --> 01:06:56,100
babies again they're complaining because the webcam isn't showing anything I'm

821
01:06:56,100 --> 01:07:00,900
forcing angel to go sit on the couch so you have someone to look at that was my

822
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:07,540
impression of the chair so I guess you could I could submit it because it

823
01:07:07,540 --> 01:07:11,540
It doesn't say that you can't. It's not in there, like, submission guideline things here.

824
01:07:11,540 --> 01:07:16,540
All it says is that, you know, you have to be the original artist of, you know, whatever it is.

825
01:07:16,540 --> 01:07:18,540
But it doesn't say it can't.

826
01:07:18,540 --> 01:07:20,540
Um, well...

827
01:07:21,540 --> 01:07:23,540
Okay. I don't know.

828
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:28,540
The worst that could happen is they call you a lamer. Honestly.

829
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:31,540
What's the worst that could happen if you submitted a song?

830
01:07:32,540 --> 01:07:34,540
I don't know. I don't really know.

831
01:07:34,540 --> 01:07:38,540
I'm trying to talk him into doing it, but he's being a pussy.

832
01:07:38,540 --> 01:07:42,540
Alright, anyway, moving right along.

833
01:07:42,540 --> 01:07:45,540
What's this stuff, you were talking during the break there, you were reading some various

834
01:07:45,540 --> 01:07:48,540
Bamani sites, finding out something going on with Papa Music?

835
01:07:48,540 --> 01:07:52,540
Papa Music Iroha, which I don't know crap about because I wasn't keeping up with Papa

836
01:07:52,540 --> 01:07:56,540
Music, but apparently Papa Music Iroha was out last week, so.

837
01:07:56,540 --> 01:08:00,540
And is that just Papa Music 12?

838
01:08:00,540 --> 01:08:03,540
I don't, yeah, I think so.

839
01:08:03,540 --> 01:08:07,540
Hooray! Another pop of music! Just what we need right now, you know?

840
01:08:07,540 --> 01:08:11,540
No, actually, I like pop of music. Uh, good time, but...

841
01:08:11,540 --> 01:08:19,540
I would pull up the title on my laptop, but I still need to install the Japanese language patch, so...

842
01:08:19,540 --> 01:08:23,540
Alright. What do you say we get into a cage match for tonight?

843
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:24,540
Sure!

844
01:08:24,540 --> 01:08:30,540
Alright, let's, uh, queue up the music, then.

845
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:35,540
Who's gonna go first in tonight's cage match? You know, we had to retire somebody last week, so now we get to go in whatever order we want.

846
01:08:35,540 --> 01:08:36,540
Why don't you start, Rob?

847
01:08:36,540 --> 01:08:38,540
I get to start? Oh goodie.

848
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:40,540
Hold on.

849
01:08:41,540 --> 01:08:42,540
Alright.

850
01:08:42,540 --> 01:08:44,540
The way the cage match works, boys and girls,

851
01:08:45,540 --> 01:08:56,540
each host brings to the table one song and you guys will vote on your favorite song, which will go into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio,

852
01:08:56,540 --> 01:09:01,540
The Monty Music and More program which plays 24 hours a day, 7 days a week on this station

853
01:09:01,540 --> 01:09:03,540
when there's no live program.

854
01:09:03,540 --> 01:09:07,540
So last week in the Orange Mountains Radio Cage match we retired a song.

855
01:09:07,540 --> 01:09:11,540
It has won for a month straight, meaning it's gone.

856
01:09:11,540 --> 01:09:16,540
Here it is, a final send off for Gwen Stefani, What You Waitin' For.

857
01:09:16,540 --> 01:09:20,540
Your life is short, you're capable

858
01:09:25,540 --> 01:09:28,540
So look at your watch now

859
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:31,540
You're still a super hot female

860
01:09:31,540 --> 01:09:35,540
You've got your million dollar contract

861
01:09:35,540 --> 01:09:38,540
And they're all waiting for your heart track

862
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:45,540
What you waiting, what you waiting, what you waiting, what you waiting, what you waiting for?

863
01:09:45,540 --> 01:09:51,540
Won't you wait it, won't you wait it, won't you wait it, won't you wait it, what you waiting for?

864
01:09:51,540 --> 01:09:55,540
I can't believe it, oh

865
01:09:55,540 --> 01:10:02,540
Alright, everybody say goodbye to Gwen Stefani, she is being retired.

866
01:10:02,540 --> 01:10:03,540
Poot!

867
01:10:03,540 --> 01:10:10,540
Alright, so we're going to go ahead and say goodbye to Gwen Stefani.

868
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:15,180
all right she is retired from the orange on straight okay too much all right that

869
01:10:15,180 --> 01:10:18,900
means you guys get three brand new songs tonight Jamie has decided that I'm gonna

870
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:24,340
go first I declare this as official woman of orange on radio okay fair enough

871
01:10:24,340 --> 01:10:30,740
I have the chair fair enough all right my song and how appropriate what my song

872
01:10:30,740 --> 01:10:36,700
is tonight I'm gonna have to dedicate this one to Jamie for that comment

873
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:47,660
My song is a song called Bitch and it's by a group called J-Punch and it's from

874
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:52,260
this trans anthems compilation I found and I liked it. So here it is song number

875
01:10:52,260 --> 01:10:59,260
number one in tonight's cage match that you can vote for, Bitch, the open air remix. Enjoy.

876
01:11:22,260 --> 01:11:27,260
You are a bitch

877
01:11:27,260 --> 01:11:31,260
And I hate myself

878
01:11:31,260 --> 01:11:36,260
And I try

879
01:11:36,260 --> 01:11:42,260
You are a bitch

880
01:11:42,260 --> 01:11:49,260
And I can't get free

881
01:11:49,260 --> 01:11:56,260
Do you wanna be king?

882
01:11:56,860 --> 01:12:00,360
And I hate myself

883
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:05,260
And I try

884
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:11,240
Do you wanna be king?

885
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:16,240
Did you wanna be king?

886
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:34,240
And I've been waiting for something, and I've tried

887
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:40,240
You do the war a bit, but you do the work a bit, but you do the work a bit

888
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:57,240
You live your life with me in the snow

889
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:01,240
And I try

890
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:08,240
You're a bad dude

891
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:16,240
You're a bad dude

892
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:18,240
In the world of revenge

893
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:20,240
You're a bitch

894
01:13:48,240 --> 01:14:09,320
Song number one in tonight's cage match, Bitch, the open air remix by J. Punch.

895
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:10,320
Jamie!

896
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:14,040
It was pretty good, I have to say.

897
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:17,480
It's a lot more energetic than most trance that you play.

898
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:19,480
I think it's the eight.

899
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:21,480
And you are a bitch.

900
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:23,480
I'm being serious.

901
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:25,480
I'm just kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

902
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:26,480
I'm a cindered.

903
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:28,480
No, I love you, treat me.

904
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:30,480
I cooked for you.

905
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:31,480
I know.

906
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:32,480
Bitch.

907
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:36,480
But you gotta remember the rest of the lyrics, and I hate myself for it, so.

908
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:37,480
Alright.

909
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:38,480
Angel.

910
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:42,480
Um, I'll give it an eight and a half.

911
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:43,480
That's pretty cool.

912
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:44,480
You're gonna be okay?

913
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:45,480
Alright.

914
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:46,480
Uh.

915
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:51,480
p0k3smot42o I give it an 8

916
01:14:51,480 --> 01:15:06,480
p0k3smot42o I mean honestly I didn't think you guys would like that one at all and it looks like our chat room doesn't so it probably doesn't have much of a chance but even though it's a little repetitive I like songs that say bitch what can I say so it gets 8 points for that

917
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:11,480
p0k3smot42o Alright let's move on to Jamie's pick, Jamie what did you pick tonight

918
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:16,760
shows a song that I'm sure everyone's probably heard, but it just really suited my mood for

919
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:26,760
the past week or so. It's Delirium with Sarah McLachlan's Silence, and it's very, very somber.

920
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:33,280
Alright, so a mood fitting one, alright. Yeah, and really I just put it in because I've been

921
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:40,680
listening to it just off and on all week, so. Alright, let's hear it. Delirium with

922
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:47,680
in silence. Enjoy.

923
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:12,680
I know

924
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:17,680
If we

925
01:16:18,680 --> 01:16:22,680
really

926
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:30,680
finish me

927
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:37,680
I am

928
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:52,680
And I can't breathe, please

929
01:16:52,680 --> 01:17:04,680
Heaven longs to stand up on earth And the warning to believe it

930
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:16,680
I get caught up when the raging river slides In this morning I am sleeping

931
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:21,680
In this silence

932
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:24,680
In this moment

933
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:34,680
In this silence I believe

934
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:58,680
I can't help this longing, comfort me

935
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:19,680
I can't hold it only if you won't let me

936
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:35,000
Heaven holds a sense of wonder And I'm wanting to believe that I'll get

937
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:40,000
When the raging leaves the fire

938
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:45,000
In this fire I am singing

939
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:50,000
In this silence

940
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:53,000
In this silence

941
01:18:53,000 --> 01:19:00,000
In this silence I believe

942
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:05,000
I have seen in this quiet way

943
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:10,000
You are silent

944
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
You are free

945
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:15,000
In this quiet way

946
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:22,000
We are free

947
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:55,360
All right, that was song number two in tonight's cage match, courtesy of Dark Sakura Delirium,

948
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:58,960
with Sarah McLachlan. Silence. Jamie, what'd you think?

949
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:02,360
I love that song. Like I said, I've been listening to it a whole bunch, so it gets an automatic

950
01:20:02,360 --> 01:20:09,040
ten for me, just from having been completely fitting my mood all week. It's been a de-stressing

951
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:12,040
song. Okay, fair enough. Loki.

952
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:24,040
God, this sounds like a sex scene, that's all it sounds like. I've heard this song so many times. It's good. I'm gonna give it an 8.

953
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:26,040
Angel.

954
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:30,040
It's Delirium, so I would probably give it a 9.

955
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:35,400
me personally about two years ago I would have given that song a 10 but I've

956
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:39,360
played the fuck out of it since then so I would give it an 8 but then I

957
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:42,920
remembered that delirium is kind of popular again in the Bahmani sing

958
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:46,680
because of after all being in ultra mix 2 so that's a good chance for those that

959
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:50,040
haven't heard that song before to kind of hear a little bit else delirium so I

960
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:56,480
give it a 9 overall all right let's see song number three tonight comes to you

961
01:20:56,480 --> 01:21:01,120
courtesy of Loki. Remember, if you don't agree with our votes, which apparently in the chat

962
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:04,080
room a lot of you guys disagree with the way we talk about song number one and you can

963
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:09,600
blow me. But remember, it does come down to your vote in the chat room. So we'll be voting

964
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:15,260
as soon as this song's done that comes to you via Loki. And what song are we gonna hear?

965
01:21:15,260 --> 01:21:19,120
Well, if you grew up in the 80s, then you already know what this song is. And if you've

966
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:23,920
watched, you know, the Breakfast Club, then you already know what this song is. This is

967
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:31,920
This is the Simple Minds with Don't You Forget About Me, and it's not sung horribly, like myself, or the singer in Carry Over Your Revolution.

968
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:34,920
What's up with you guys and old school songs tonight?

969
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:41,480
All right fair enough anything's game here in the orange launch cage match, and this is it simple minds. Don't you forget about me enjoy?

970
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:33,040
Won't you come see about me, I'll be alone Dancin' you know it, baby, I'll be the one

971
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:38,540
You know it baby, tell me your troubles and doubts

972
01:22:38,540 --> 01:22:43,040
Given everything inside and out and

973
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:47,040
Love's strange, the real and the dark

974
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:52,040
Think of the tender things that we were working on

975
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:56,040
Slow change may pull us apart

976
01:22:56,040 --> 01:23:00,540
When our lives get in your heart baby

977
01:23:00,540 --> 01:23:05,540
Don't you forget about me

978
01:23:06,540 --> 01:23:09,540
Don't, don't, don't, don't

979
01:23:09,540 --> 01:23:14,540
Don't you forget about me

980
01:23:17,540 --> 01:23:21,540
Will you stand above me

981
01:23:21,540 --> 01:23:25,540
Look my way, will you ever love me

982
01:23:25,540 --> 01:23:34,540
Rain keeps falling, rain keeps falling down, down, down

983
01:23:34,540 --> 01:23:42,540
Will you recognize me? Call my name or walk on by

984
01:23:42,540 --> 01:23:53,540
Rain keeps falling, rain keeps falling down, down, down, down

985
01:23:53,540 --> 01:23:56,540
Hey, hey, hey, hey

986
01:24:09,540 --> 01:24:13,540
Don't you try and pretend

987
01:24:13,540 --> 01:24:16,540
It's my view you will win

988
01:24:16,540 --> 01:24:19,540
And I won't harm you

989
01:24:19,540 --> 01:24:22,540
Or touch your defensive vanity

990
01:24:22,540 --> 01:24:37,540
Don't you forget about me, I'll be alone Dance when you know it baby, I'm going to

991
01:24:37,540 --> 01:24:43,540
take you apart I'll put it back together, baby

992
01:24:43,540 --> 01:24:48,540
Don't you forget about me

993
01:24:49,540 --> 01:24:52,540
Don't, don't, don't, don't

994
01:24:52,540 --> 01:24:57,540
Don't you forget about me

995
01:25:00,540 --> 01:25:04,540
Will you stand above me

996
01:25:04,540 --> 01:25:06,540
Look my way

997
01:25:06,540 --> 01:25:09,540
Do you ever love me

998
01:25:09,540 --> 01:25:11,540
Rain keeps falling

999
01:25:11,540 --> 01:25:17,540
Rain keeps falling down

1000
01:25:17,540 --> 01:25:22,540
Will you recognize me?

1001
01:25:22,540 --> 01:25:26,540
Call my name or walk on by

1002
01:25:26,540 --> 01:25:36,540
Rain keeps falling, rain keeps falling down

1003
01:25:36,540 --> 01:25:41,540
Hey, hey, hey, hey hey

1004
01:25:41,540 --> 01:25:46,540
Ooh, ooh

1005
01:25:50,540 --> 01:25:55,540
Hey, hey, hey, hey

1006
01:25:55,540 --> 01:26:01,540
Ooh, ooh

1007
01:26:01,540 --> 01:26:15,540
Don't you forget about me

1008
01:26:15,540 --> 01:26:19,540
Don't, don't, don't, don't

1009
01:26:19,540 --> 01:26:25,540
Don't you forget about me

1010
01:26:25,540 --> 01:26:34,040
As you walk on by, will you call my name?

1011
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:42,540
As you walk on by, will you call my name?

1012
01:26:42,540 --> 01:26:45,540
When you walk away

1013
01:26:45,540 --> 01:27:14,540
Oh will you walk away, will you walk on by I won't call my name, will you call my name

1014
01:28:14,540 --> 01:28:19,540
Alright, song number three in tonight's cage match, Simple Minds, Don't You Forget About Me.

1015
01:28:19,540 --> 01:28:20,540
Jamie?

1016
01:28:20,540 --> 01:28:23,540
I love this song to bits.

1017
01:28:23,540 --> 01:28:26,540
So much, and I'm so glad it's not a crappy remix.

1018
01:28:26,540 --> 01:28:33,540
So, uh, there are 80 songs that I like better, but I really like that one a whole lot, so it gets a 9.

1019
01:28:33,540 --> 01:28:36,540
Alright, Loki.

1020
01:28:36,540 --> 01:28:39,540
I like that song, so it gets a 10.

1021
01:28:39,540 --> 01:28:43,540
Because? I don't know.

1022
01:28:43,540 --> 01:28:50,540
kostjamrh I just remembered, I was going to do a Duran Duran song tonight and I totally forgot. Alright, anyway. Angel.

1023
01:29:13,540 --> 01:29:20,580
me personally I love that song a lot I just would have loved it at DDR length a

1024
01:29:20,580 --> 01:29:24,840
lot more that song went on forever so I give it a six for the number of minutes

1025
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:33,460
it was all right let's review the songs you can vote for tonight starting off

1030
01:30:32,540 --> 01:30:38,300
with your vote and we'll tally them up and see who the winner is all right

1031
01:30:38,300 --> 01:30:44,140
meanwhile some stuff's going on here locally in town we just we found out

1032
01:30:44,140 --> 01:30:47,220
something going on in one of our local arcades we've talked about a little bit

1033
01:30:47,220 --> 01:30:54,620
on this show our vehicle RV GL and this new rumor has come up although you can't

1034
01:30:54,620 --> 01:30:57,700
really call it a rumor I would say it's in that stage where it hasn't happened

1035
01:30:57,700 --> 01:31:03,540
yet but it's a lot more solid than a rumor so it's kind of a it's a congealed

1036
01:31:03,540 --> 01:31:06,600
mass yeah basically I don't know what you would call it when it's not really a

1037
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:10,420
rumor because there's lots of facts backing it up but there it's not hasn't

1038
01:31:10,420 --> 01:31:13,820
happened yet either so it's that almost stage but that is is that Roseville

1039
01:31:13,820 --> 01:31:18,220
Golf Land is going to get a 2DX machine, basically.

1040
01:31:18,220 --> 01:31:23,220
What I think is most exciting about this is the fact that I think this is going to bring

1041
01:31:23,220 --> 01:31:27,280
people back to RVGL, because let's face it, it's winter time now, so there's not as many

1042
01:31:27,280 --> 01:31:33,740
stupid theme park kids hanging around there, and honestly, we've been kind of missing something

1043
01:31:33,740 --> 01:31:36,180
like this for a while. You know what I mean? Remember when we used to have those Wednesday

1044
01:31:36,180 --> 01:31:41,760
nights over at Golf Land, and we'd all go, and man, what was new in those days? That

1045
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:57,560
I remember that, because everybody was trying to unlock stuff in Max 2, and I kept trying

1046
01:31:57,560 --> 01:32:02,840
to get AAA's on songs. I would just play sets of basic songs to try and get AAA's, because

1047
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:06,480
that was 10 points off if you could get a AAA. Remember that? That was fun. And then

1048
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:10,120
we'd all go to Brick Fields afterwards. I'm sure somewhere in your town, and I know we're

1049
01:32:10,120 --> 01:32:13,360
national in some cases international broadcast I know maybe in your neck of

1050
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:16,480
the woods you guys do something similar but we haven't been doing this for about

1051
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:20,760
a year and a half when I don't know what happened like suddenly Scandia got the

1052
01:32:20,760 --> 01:32:24,280
2DX machine a competing arcade in town and then everybody went there and then

1053
01:32:24,280 --> 01:32:27,480
kind of everything kind of fell apart basically is what happened in the end so

1054
01:32:27,480 --> 01:32:31,240
it's kind of exciting that Roseville Golf Line is gonna get 2DX machine 2DX it

1055
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:38,020
brings people together and how long do we freaking tell them seriously I give

1056
01:32:38,020 --> 01:32:42,020
One week, and it's in operable.

1057
01:32:42,020 --> 01:32:43,020
Sorry, broken?

1058
01:32:43,020 --> 01:32:44,020
One week and it's broken.

1059
01:32:44,020 --> 01:32:48,020
I will take a step further and say that the DVD drive goes out.

1060
01:32:48,020 --> 01:32:55,020
One week and it's broken. They're buying a new monitor for it because I guess the monitor that was on it was fucked.

1061
01:32:55,020 --> 01:32:58,020
Well, it's probably the old Shiggle monitor, huh?

1062
01:32:58,020 --> 01:33:00,020
Usually, yes.

1063
01:33:00,020 --> 01:33:05,020
So, um, I give it a week before the little kids fuck it up.

1064
01:33:05,020 --> 01:33:09,020
I still think it's going to be the DVD drive that goes out or someone's going to spill something on the panel.

1065
01:33:09,020 --> 01:33:16,020
It's going to be shit. And I'm afraid, you know, it's going to make people even more pissed off because it's just another game that they're not going to fix up.

1066
01:33:16,020 --> 01:33:21,020
But, hey, whatever. Whatever makes you happy, I guess, you know.

1067
01:33:21,020 --> 01:33:24,020
Whatever sinks your battleship.

1068
01:33:27,020 --> 01:33:34,020
I totally agree with the fact that some little kid is probably going to spill something on it. I just hope they put the machine in a place where somebody can watch it.

1069
01:33:34,020 --> 01:33:40,500
it? I don't know. What can they do to help 2DX not die? What do you guys think they could

1070
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:41,500
do?

1071
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:49,100
Uh, have a guard posted there 24-7, and have a height bar for you to be able to go up to

1072
01:33:49,100 --> 01:33:50,100
the machine.

1073
01:33:50,100 --> 01:33:51,580
That guard will be you, Jamie.

1074
01:33:51,580 --> 01:33:53,700
They'll pay me, okay.

1075
01:33:53,700 --> 01:34:02,940
Alright. I'm tallying up the votes for the cage match right now. What else do you think

1076
01:34:02,940 --> 01:34:06,380
would be something fun that we could do to kind of get the crowds going to Golf Land

1077
01:34:06,380 --> 01:34:07,380
again.

1078
01:34:07,380 --> 01:34:13,220
I know. How about they fix my fucking machine that I built them? They spent all my hard

1079
01:34:13,220 --> 01:34:20,760
time on and then went to shit really quick. How about that? That might be nice. Seriously,

1080
01:34:20,760 --> 01:34:26,620
I don't know why I even try anymore. You know, why do I try? Because it just goes to shit.

1081
01:34:26,620 --> 01:34:31,280
Fuck them. That's what I say. Fuck them. You know, I'm going to make my own machine. I'll

1082
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:50,280
I'm just tired of it. Tired of spending my time there trying to fix shit. Tired of people asking me to fix shit. I don't work there. I don't want to fix it. Hell, I didn't get paid for the last parts that I donated to fix it. So you know what? Fuck it. I don't care.

1083
01:34:50,280 --> 01:34:57,280
So, yeah. What could they do to bring people back?

1084
01:34:57,280 --> 01:35:06,280
Pay them. Strippers on bars. This would be RVGL, water slides, and strippers.

1085
01:35:06,280 --> 01:35:11,280
Hey, they have dock. And derby on their floor.

1086
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:15,280
I need to go raise Ganguro again. Part of me kinda wants to go to RVGL tomorrow

1087
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:19,280
to see if they got the machine up and running. I just, another fact that makes me very happy

1088
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:23,500
that our Vigle is getting 2DX is that I really don't like going to Spigle to play, and I

1089
01:35:23,500 --> 01:35:27,460
apologize if you're a Spigle regular, but there's a lot of you guys that hang out there

1090
01:35:27,460 --> 01:35:34,000
that are kind of dicks, and I'm sorry, but like, I just feel this very thick, uh, you

1091
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:35,000
know what I mean?

1092
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:36,000
Thickiness.

1093
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,000
Thick thickness.

1094
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:43,920
When I walk into Spigle, it's like, if you can't pass eight stars, then you suck, and

1095
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:48,080
you shouldn't even deserve to play here, and they don't tell people when they get new machines

1096
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:51,880
and stuff because they don't want scary newbies around and stuff, and I just don't like that

1097
01:35:51,880 --> 01:35:55,000
attitude, you know what I mean? And I'm sorry, because I have friends that play Swiggle,

1098
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:59,000
you know, I'm not saying this is a, every single person is like this, but I just feel

1099
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:04,620
this aura of shittiness when I walk in there, and I'm sorry. So that makes me very happy

1100
01:36:04,620 --> 01:36:08,020
that our wiggle is going to be getting a machine, because I think a lot of people, even though

1101
01:36:08,020 --> 01:36:17,480
our wiggle is kind of a, I don't, how do you put it? It's a dump in pretty rapping, basically.

1102
01:36:17,480 --> 01:36:22,120
the people there really are pretty good. And I sense a lot of friendly people and, you

1103
01:36:22,120 --> 01:36:26,000
know, I think more of a, you know, just try your best type attitude. At least that's how

1104
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:31,280
I feel. I don't know. You feel that, Jamie? Or is it just me? I'm sorry, she's watching.

1105
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:33,800
What about you, Loki? Have you been to play at Spigold?

1106
01:36:33,800 --> 01:36:56,800
Uh, a few times. It's too cramped for my taste. They have way too many machines in a way too small arcade. That's the only thing I got from it. Um, but, I don't know. They have In the Groove now. I guess that's not, I don't know. I wouldn't want to play In the Groove, but you know, that's just me.

1107
01:36:56,800 --> 01:37:04,680
But, you know, honestly, I would rather them put in the groove in that cabinet that's broken

1108
01:37:04,680 --> 01:37:09,720
right now than, you know, have it be just not working at all. You know, I'd rather have

1109
01:37:09,720 --> 01:37:15,720
that cabinet being used for something other than just to sit there broken. And if that's

1110
01:37:15,720 --> 01:37:19,680
what they gotta do, then go ahead, buy the machine, put it in there, so then we can upgrade

1111
01:37:19,680 --> 01:37:24,720
it to mine with working parts.

1112
01:37:24,720 --> 01:37:28,500
And again, I don't want to bash on everybody that goes to Sviggle, I'm not trying to start

1113
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:33,320
any drama or anything, it's just I've had one too many kind of shitty experiences when

1114
01:37:33,320 --> 01:37:36,540
I was there, so I'm sure there's a lot of great people, in fact I know there's a lot

1115
01:37:36,540 --> 01:37:39,720
of great people that play Sviggle, it's just that there's a lot of attitude that comes

1116
01:37:39,720 --> 01:37:41,840
along with Sviggle, so I don't know.

1117
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:45,980
As far as In the Groove goes, you know, I talked about the game before on the show,

1118
01:37:45,980 --> 01:37:50,000
I got to play it, and it's okay, there's things I like about it, there's things I don't like

1119
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:51,000
about it.

1120
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:54,320
I would rather see In the Groove than nothing, I mean it's a nice little addition, it's something

1121
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:59,220
I would play once in a while. It's not something I'm going to go gaga over. It is not a replacement

1122
01:37:59,220 --> 01:38:06,080
for DDR, I don't think, but it's something to kind of pass the time. And again, the one

1123
01:38:06,080 --> 01:38:09,600
thing that always kind of bugged me about, excuse me, the one thing that always kind

1124
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:14,880
of bugged me about In the Groove is that In the Groove is not DDR unless it's convenient

1125
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:19,120
for it to be DDR. You know what I mean? Like, when it's convenient to say it's the new DDR,

1126
01:38:19,120 --> 01:38:22,800
then it's the new DDR. But when, you know, it's being bashed on, then oh well, you can't

1127
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:26,360
say that because it's not DDR. It's kind of like, you know, make up your mind, is it DDR

1128
01:38:26,360 --> 01:38:34,360
or not? So, we'll see. Anyway, Jamie, did you have any thoughts on...?

1129
01:38:34,360 --> 01:38:40,160
I'm sorry, I had to take care of some business. That's all right.

1130
01:38:40,160 --> 01:38:44,440
About In the Groove? Anything, either In the Groove or Sviggle

1131
01:38:44,440 --> 01:38:47,120
versus, you know, other places. You know, I, Sviggles, I...

1132
01:38:47,120 --> 01:38:49,880
And not necessarily are Sviggles specifically, just Sviggle in general.

1133
01:38:49,880 --> 01:38:57,220
No offense to the swigglers, but walking into that place is like walking into, you know, a garage that somebody's put too much crap in.

1134
01:38:58,220 --> 01:39:02,380
It's just not comfortable there.

1135
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:10,980
I'd rather go to Miggle, where there's tons of room, generally nicer, more attentive people, than go waste my time at SVGL.

1136
01:39:11,680 --> 01:39:13,880
No offense to any of my friends that go there.

1137
01:39:17,180 --> 01:39:18,180
That's how I feel.

1138
01:39:18,180 --> 01:39:22,580
All right, well that's what we think. If you disagree, you're welcome to join the chat

1139
01:39:22,580 --> 01:39:27,220
or call us on the Skyline a little later. Anyway, meanwhile, you guys want to figure

1140
01:39:27,220 --> 01:39:29,420
out who won the cage match? Yes, sir.

1141
01:39:29,420 --> 01:39:35,180
All right, we're going to go to cage match and the winner is... This is a very unique

1142
01:39:35,180 --> 01:39:42,300
situation. Tonight, in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, we had a three-way tie.

1143
01:39:42,300 --> 01:39:46,800
No way! Three-way tie, and a lot of people voted tonight,

1144
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:49,240
And it's still a three-way tie.

1145
01:39:49,240 --> 01:39:51,080
Here's the weird thing.

1146
01:39:51,080 --> 01:39:53,080
Typically in a three-way tie,

1147
01:39:53,080 --> 01:39:57,160
then the song that got thrown out, whoever put that song in, gets to vote on

1148
01:39:57,160 --> 01:39:58,380
the winner.

1149
01:39:58,380 --> 01:39:59,520
But the problem is,

1150
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:03,760
there is no song being thrown out this week because they're three brand new songs.

1151
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:05,960
So we have to go to Plan B.

1152
01:40:05,960 --> 01:40:09,120
And basically what happens in Plan B, and I think this has only ever happened one

1153
01:40:09,120 --> 01:40:10,560
time in show history,

1154
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:13,240
is that everybody else in the room who isn't a host

1155
01:40:13,240 --> 01:40:15,400
gets to vote on the song that wins.

1156
01:40:15,400 --> 01:40:18,200
but we only have one person which means there's only one other person here in

1157
01:40:18,200 --> 01:40:18,960
the room tonight

1158
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:22,400
that means angel is going to break the tie so I gave her a little piece of

1159
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:22,960
paper

1160
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:26,840
she's gonna write down on there her favorite song

1161
01:40:26,840 --> 01:40:32,760
to win tonight's cage match no pressure

1162
01:40:32,760 --> 01:40:39,760
but she's thinking about her vote

1163
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:47,360
That's right.

1164
01:40:47,360 --> 01:40:49,720
She's walking to her pen.

1165
01:40:49,720 --> 01:40:54,280
She's writing it down on the piece of paper.

1166
01:40:54,280 --> 01:40:55,280
All right.

1167
01:40:55,280 --> 01:40:56,680
She's got it?

1168
01:40:56,680 --> 01:40:57,680
Okay.

1169
01:40:57,680 --> 01:40:59,760
I have the vote in my hand.

1170
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:06,000
Remember, once the votes are tallied, the other two songs have to leave.

1171
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:10,600
I will now read the vote.

1172
01:41:10,600 --> 01:41:17,600
The winning song of tonight's cage match as decided on by DDR Angel.

1173
01:41:17,600 --> 01:41:19,920
Is there any particular, oh I have to ask you first, is there any particular reason

1174
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:21,800
you voted for this song?

1175
01:41:21,800 --> 01:41:22,800
No.

1176
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:23,800
Alright.

1177
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:30,960
Let's see, shall I walk over to the cam?

1178
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:31,960
Sure.

1179
01:41:31,960 --> 01:41:32,960
Alright.

1180
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:36,960
This is a big moment in Orange Launch Radio History.

1181
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:44,960
Let's see, here we go.

1182
01:41:44,960 --> 01:41:52,960
And the winning song for tonight is

1183
01:41:52,960 --> 01:41:59,960
song number one. Song number one.

1184
01:41:59,960 --> 01:42:08,440
So, that means by a three-way tie-breaker. See, now everyone's dying in the chat room.

1185
01:42:08,440 --> 01:42:12,400
What have I done? Bitch wins the cage match, which is ironic

1186
01:42:12,400 --> 01:42:15,840
because it's the song that got dogged on the most by the chat room.

1187
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:27,000
Hold on, I gotta play the victory lap here. Bitch wins tonight's cage match.

1188
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:32,000
Any particular reason you picked that one? You gave that one the lowest score out of the three, so I'm kind of surprised that you voted for that one.

1189
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:37,000
Well, I kind of thought of it and, well, I don't know, I kind of like it. It's kind of...

1190
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:42,000
Well, it's more, I guess you could call it a club song, I don't know.

1191
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:45,000
Most dancey out of the three, I guess?

1192
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:50,000
That actually makes me happy because the chat room was so, like, anti-that song.

1193
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
See, they don't like it too bad!

1194
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:57,000
You guys voted for it in a three-way tie. If any one of you had voted differently, it would have been different.

1195
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:58,000
I'm kidding. I love you, chat room.

1196
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
Alright, there you have it.

1197
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:03,000
Alright, so Bitch will be back next week with two new songs.

1198
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:06,000
That was good, though. We don't get three-way ties very often.

1199
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:11,000
But it was an exact- it was a multiple of three votes and every one had the same amount. It's crazy.

1200
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
Wasn't this one like the second time it's happened or something?

1201
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
I think it's only like the second time it's happened. Ever.

1202
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:16,000
Yeah.

1203
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:17,000
Alright.

1204
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
I feel special now. Yay!

1205
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:48,800
The first ever versions of songs that have been remixed to the point of making people

1206
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:56,520
physically ill. Like, paranoia. Wow, okay. Wow, that is a crazy theme, okay, but we can

1207
01:43:56,520 --> 01:44:04,000
do that. Max 300. Okay. Pre-remix. Alright. And, and actually, just for the hell of it,

1208
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:09,080
because I hadn't heard it in forever, dropout. Even though that has nothing to do with...

1209
01:44:09,080 --> 01:44:11,840
Even though. Alright. Because I can't think of any others. Oh my god, I don't think I

1210
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:15,440
have the original paranoia, it's not in the potpourri directory. Okay, okay, I'll tell

1211
01:44:15,440 --> 01:44:16,440
Trip Machine.

1212
01:44:16,440 --> 01:44:17,440
Want a Trip Machine?

1213
01:44:17,440 --> 01:44:18,440
Do I have a Trip Machine?

1214
01:44:18,440 --> 01:44:19,440
I don't have a Trip Machine.

1215
01:44:19,440 --> 01:44:20,440
Alright.

1216
01:44:20,440 --> 01:44:21,440
We'll do $300.

1217
01:44:21,440 --> 01:44:22,440
No, that's it.

1218
01:44:22,440 --> 01:44:23,440
Um, throw in QQQ.

1219
01:44:23,440 --> 01:44:24,440
Cuckoo.

1220
01:44:24,440 --> 01:44:25,440
For no good reason.

1221
01:44:25,440 --> 01:44:26,440
Thank you.

1222
01:44:26,440 --> 01:44:27,440
For no good reason.

1223
01:44:27,440 --> 01:44:28,440
For no good reason.

1224
01:44:28,440 --> 01:44:29,440
It's, it's Taku.

1225
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:30,440
I will say thank you for that.

1226
01:44:30,440 --> 01:44:31,440
Haha pun.

1227
01:44:31,440 --> 01:44:32,440
Shoot me.

1228
01:44:32,440 --> 01:44:43,440
We'll be right back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

1229
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:50,440
go.

1230
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:52,440
Think about the dance now Think, think about the dance now

1231
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:15,440
you

1232
01:49:43,440 --> 01:49:57,320
Orange Lounge Radio is proud to present a celebrity interview.

1233
01:49:57,320 --> 01:49:59,180
Can you introduce yourself for our listeners?

1234
01:49:59,180 --> 01:50:00,180
I'm Miss Cleo.

1235
01:50:00,180 --> 01:50:02,440
Oh, it's great to have you on the show today.

1236
01:50:02,440 --> 01:50:04,080
Hello, how are you today?

1237
01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:05,200
I'm great, thanks.

1238
01:50:05,200 --> 01:50:06,520
Did you have a question?

1239
01:50:06,520 --> 01:50:09,120
Well, yes, actually I wanted to know.

1240
01:50:09,120 --> 01:50:13,120
Can I please have your first name only and your birth date, please?

1241
01:50:13,120 --> 01:50:18,120
Uh, well, no, I actually just wanted to know what you thought of Orange Lounge Radio.

1242
01:50:18,120 --> 01:50:20,120
Alright, go ahead.

1243
01:50:20,120 --> 01:50:23,120
Well, what do you think of Loki, one of the three hosts of Orange Lounge Radio?

1244
01:50:23,120 --> 01:50:25,120
Is he incarcerated?

1245
01:50:25,120 --> 01:50:29,120
Uh, actually, no, he's not, but what do you think of the ever-ranty Dark Zakra?

1246
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:30,120
Hi, dear, how are you?

1247
01:50:30,120 --> 01:50:32,120
I love you.

1248
01:50:32,120 --> 01:50:35,120
I see you two must know each other. Well, what do you think of Sky?

1249
01:50:35,120 --> 01:50:37,120
Did he used to play football when he was in high school?

1250
01:50:37,120 --> 01:50:38,120
Well, actually, no, he didn't.

1251
01:50:38,120 --> 01:50:41,120
Well, what do you think of Intern Zero?

1252
01:50:41,120 --> 01:50:45,120
I want you to really remember the pill, all right?

1253
01:50:45,120 --> 01:50:47,120
I'm seeing some forgetting, possibly.

1254
01:50:47,120 --> 01:50:51,120
And I'm seeing a new baby in the next three months.

1255
01:50:51,120 --> 01:50:55,120
Right. Okay, well, thanks for being on Orange Lounge Radio today.

1256
01:50:55,120 --> 01:50:57,120
Um, I don't mean to sidetrack your question here,

1257
01:50:57,120 --> 01:51:00,120
but who are all of these nosy people,

1258
01:51:00,120 --> 01:51:04,120
outside influences I'm seeing around you by the moon card?

1259
01:51:04,120 --> 01:51:07,120
Get away from me.

1260
01:51:07,120 --> 01:51:12,720
Orange Lounge Radio, helping to free your mind and spirit.

1261
01:51:12,720 --> 01:51:15,320
I'm Miss Cleo, I love you!

1262
01:51:19,320 --> 01:51:22,620
We are back, here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1263
01:51:22,620 --> 01:51:25,720
Episode number 122, In Progress.

1264
01:51:25,720 --> 01:51:29,220
Can't believe we've been doing this crap this long, can you believe that?

1265
01:51:29,220 --> 01:51:32,920
I like your shirt there, Angel, that you're wearing. The old

1266
01:51:32,920 --> 01:51:36,680
classic Nintendo controller there with the know your roots I've seen that for

1267
01:51:36,680 --> 01:51:37,520
sale before

1268
01:51:37,520 --> 01:51:41,360
yeah it's nice you're around but

1269
01:51:41,360 --> 01:51:45,960
you know I mean you always wear some kinda 8-bit shirt when you come over

1270
01:51:45,960 --> 01:51:47,160
here I know this I just

1271
01:51:47,160 --> 01:51:51,240
I kinda notice this trend you got you have your we do you are you going to

1272
01:51:51,240 --> 01:51:53,920
make a man sure you have that you have the Piranha Plant this is bite me

1273
01:51:53,920 --> 01:51:57,800
and then it's bite me I have the

1274
01:51:57,800 --> 01:52:01,440
was I got mad bills which is the bullet bill one

1275
01:52:01,440 --> 01:52:17,440
The only one I have is the Goomba one that says you lose, because I like that one. I actually wore that to the live 365 awards, so that was kind of an omen that year.

1276
01:52:17,440 --> 01:52:26,400
Yup, and the same day that I had picked up the Bite Me shirt, I washed it and wore it

1277
01:52:26,400 --> 01:52:31,680
over here that night, and you were wearing your Hulu shirt, so it kind of...

1278
01:52:31,680 --> 01:52:32,680
Oh yeah, I remember that.

1279
01:52:32,680 --> 01:52:33,680
You were!

1280
01:52:33,680 --> 01:52:34,680
Oh, we were twins!

1281
01:52:34,680 --> 01:52:35,680
It was so cute!

1282
01:52:35,680 --> 01:52:36,680
Yay!

1283
01:52:36,680 --> 01:52:37,680
We were twins!

1284
01:52:37,680 --> 01:52:39,080
I liked the Nintendo shirts when they were underground, though.

1285
01:52:39,080 --> 01:52:42,360
I mean, not that they're not cute now, but you know, it was better when they weren't,

1286
01:52:42,360 --> 01:52:45,800
you know, like, you'd seen them all at Hot Topic already and stuff, you know?

1287
01:52:45,800 --> 01:52:48,800
There's actually another store that's carrying gaming shirts now.

1288
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:49,600
Oh, who's that?

1289
01:52:49,600 --> 01:52:51,500
Uh, T-Shirts Plus.

1290
01:52:51,500 --> 01:52:53,640
That must be a local thing.

1291
01:52:53,640 --> 01:52:57,040
Well, it might not be a local thing, but, uh,

1292
01:52:57,040 --> 01:52:58,860
I can't remember which, like,

1293
01:52:58,860 --> 01:53:00,600
mall it is around here.

1294
01:53:00,600 --> 01:53:07,600
Dang it. Alright, well, I'll just have to take your word for it, I suppose. I believe it's Arden, actually, now that I think about it.

1295
01:53:07,740 --> 01:53:09,720
Alright, um, let's see,

1296
01:53:09,720 --> 01:53:13,100
we're gonna go on over to Loki, if you don't mind,

1297
01:53:13,100 --> 01:53:20,100
And I was curious what's going on in the Sims scene right now, besides the dancing characters, of course. Is there any other news going on out there right now?

1298
01:53:20,100 --> 01:53:29,100
Besides numerous websites being down, not really, no. No, really, actually, nothing's going on at all.

1299
01:53:29,100 --> 01:53:38,100
I couldn't really tell you any updates on Step Mini. I don't think there have been any new releases of it since Release Candidate 2, if I remember correctly.

1300
01:53:38,100 --> 01:53:56,100
I know that they're still hard at work over on DDRUK on getting those sim files out for, was it, a Dancing Stage Fusion and, let's see, DDRFestival and Ultramix 2. Those are almost done.

1301
01:53:56,100 --> 01:54:10,100
I think Festival is close to being done, they're waiting on graphics, and Ultramix 2 they're still working on, and I would assume by now that Fusion's done it, because that game's been out forever now.

1302
01:54:10,100 --> 01:54:21,100
I think they're just gonna be doing like one update where they have them all up online, but still nothing yet on those, but should be soon, hopefully.

1303
01:54:21,100 --> 01:54:27,100
And then, um, really, other than that, I don't think there's anything else going on, sort of sim-related.

1304
01:54:27,100 --> 01:54:36,100
Um, FoodMix Plus, um, it was just announced, actually, that they were going to be releasing, of course, exclusively in Japan,

1305
01:54:36,100 --> 01:54:42,100
um, a soundtrack for FoodMix Plus and FoodMix, I guess, that's going to be out there.

1306
01:54:42,100 --> 01:54:46,100
There's a little demo on the FoodMix site, I don't remember the URL by chance right now,

1307
01:54:46,100 --> 01:54:49,820
now but that's gonna be coming out eventually with all extended tracks and

1308
01:54:49,820 --> 01:54:56,340
stuff from your favorite food mix artists and really other than that not

1309
01:54:56,340 --> 01:55:00,980
much going on right now pretty quiet that food mix soundtrack sounds pretty

1310
01:55:00,980 --> 01:55:04,380
exciting though I'd be looking forward to that food mix is some good stuff and

1311
01:55:04,380 --> 01:55:08,740
not just there and I wouldn't even call them Bahmani remixes because they're

1312
01:55:08,740 --> 01:55:11,740
they're almost these completely different songs that are just kind of

1313
01:55:11,740 --> 01:55:15,980
inspired by familiar Bahmani tunes not just those but their original stuff is

1314
01:55:15,980 --> 01:55:19,540
freaking great too so hats off to those guys for putting a soundtrack together

1315
01:55:19,540 --> 01:55:24,080
and as I mentioned probably last week in the week before last and so on and so

1316
01:55:24,080 --> 01:55:29,820
forth there's the brand new diverse systems album that's coming out called

1317
01:55:29,820 --> 01:55:35,340
and this was as you may remember dear mr. 180 well now we have dear mr. desire

1318
01:55:35,340 --> 01:55:39,740
which is all remixes which is ironically enough it's remixes of revenge and

1319
01:55:39,740 --> 01:55:45,100
desire songs so get all your trip machine cigar ooh and healing vision

1320
01:55:45,100 --> 01:55:52,940
remixes out there they're all on this one CD here from diverse systems and

1321
01:55:52,940 --> 01:55:57,300
also the food mix CD should be available through silly Walker which is another

1322
01:55:57,300 --> 01:56:02,860
diverse systems like site fortunately all these sites being located in Japan

1323
01:56:02,860 --> 01:56:07,100
they're only selling you know exclusively in Japan so it's really hard

1324
01:56:07,100 --> 01:56:11,380
to get a hold of this stuff especially if you don't speak Japanese it's pretty

1325
01:56:11,380 --> 01:56:18,180
hard to find it, but it's out there, so, you know, try your best. I know that Diverse Systems

1326
01:56:18,180 --> 01:56:24,820
is re-updating their entire English page, so I'm sure that D7 along with, you know,

1327
01:56:24,820 --> 01:56:29,320
this brand new album should be up there eventually as soon as they get done with that, probably

1328
01:56:29,320 --> 01:56:30,320
next year.

1329
01:56:30,320 --> 01:56:40,140
Alright, good times. Moving right along, excuse me. You know, going back to a topic that we

1330
01:56:40,140 --> 01:56:46,860
we had going on earlier in this show, John, you know John in our chat room, he actually

1331
01:56:46,860 --> 01:56:51,140
went to the OC Remix and got one of them to come over here to try and talk you into, I

1332
01:56:51,140 --> 01:56:55,140
don't know if they're here to talk you into it or what, but answer any questions you may

1333
01:56:55,140 --> 01:56:59,900
have about the OC Remix policy. You know what, Loki? I think you're just going to have to

1334
01:56:59,900 --> 01:57:00,900
do it.

1335
01:57:00,900 --> 01:57:04,820
I don't care. I just don't think it's, you know, usually...

1336
01:57:04,820 --> 01:57:06,500
You think you're not worthy, is that what it is?

1337
01:57:06,500 --> 01:57:07,500
I guess.

1338
01:57:07,500 --> 01:57:11,500
Yes. You've got all these listeners telling you you're worthy. Just do it!

1339
01:57:11,500 --> 01:57:15,500
Do it! Do it, Loki! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!

1340
01:57:15,500 --> 01:57:19,500
Yes. That's the spirit. Yay!

1341
01:57:19,500 --> 01:57:23,500
Alright. So you guys can be looking forward to that.

1342
01:57:23,500 --> 01:57:27,500
I think it would be funny if we went through all that and then they say,

1343
01:57:27,500 --> 01:57:31,500
Oh, sorry. This sucks. I'd laugh.

1344
01:57:31,500 --> 01:57:35,500
Hey, it would give us good material for next week's show, so I'm down for it.

1345
01:57:35,500 --> 01:57:39,500
Good luck to you, Loki. I hope it works out for you. I think that'll be fun.

1346
01:57:39,500 --> 01:57:45,500
Alright. Oh, John's going all the way to the top. Look at that.

1347
01:57:45,500 --> 01:57:50,500
That guy's crazy. That guy's your biggest fan. Look at that.

1348
01:57:50,500 --> 01:57:55,500
Loki's turning red. I'd better change the subject.

1349
01:57:55,500 --> 01:58:00,500
Yes, Loki. Since we gotta get to actual news now.

1350
01:58:00,500 --> 01:58:29,500
You know, so we do all this fun stuff and then get back to some actual news. The full unlock list for 2DX Red has been released actually. With some interesting information here, we've got all the hidden songs. So we have, you know, Agia by Ryu, Blox by Sparker, The Hope of Tomorrow by Sota, Earth Escape by DJ Taka, Ultimate by Terra, Fake Time by DJ RemoCon.

1351
01:58:29,500 --> 01:58:50,220
RemoCon, and Close My Eyes For Me by D. Crew featuring Dennis Gunn. And also with Hidden

1352
01:58:50,220 --> 01:58:58,900
and Others for Double A, Andromeda, and Gigadelic. I told Navi, and if you're out there listening

1353
01:58:58,900 --> 01:59:04,320
Navi, you pop and music horror friend of mine, and 2DX horror part-time. I told you when

1354
01:59:04,320 --> 01:59:08,160
you said that there were not a whole lot of others in 2DX Red, I said, they're probably

1355
01:59:08,160 --> 01:59:16,040
hidden. I told you so, I told you so, I told you so. Thank you. Anyways, also should mention,

1356
01:59:16,040 --> 01:59:20,960
since it's sort of Bomani-related, exclusively through BomaniStyle.com, they're gonna be

1357
01:59:20,960 --> 01:59:27,760
releasing Slake's new album. And Slake, for those who you might not know, is an old-school

1358
01:59:27,760 --> 01:59:36,300
Bamani Artist. Anyways, some of the titles for these songs here, Past Oriental Mechanist,

1359
01:59:36,300 --> 01:59:44,900
The Fading of Light, Justified, Rush, I Am a Clone, and looks like Astro, I can't even

1360
01:59:44,900 --> 01:59:50,660
pronounce that, Astro Oxy Remix. Anyways, and those should be coming soon. They're doing

1361
01:59:50,660 --> 01:59:55,060
some stupid little contests here where you get to design like the cover and yada yada

1362
01:59:55,060 --> 02:00:01,880
got it. So go to Bumicell, check it out. Here's a little clip of Slake, if you're unfamiliar

1363
02:00:01,880 --> 02:00:04,880
with Slake. Here's a little clip of Cloudy Music from Seventh Style.

1364
02:00:04,880 --> 02:00:23,880
So I don't know what exactly you would call Slake's style of music. It's just, it's funky

1365
02:00:23,880 --> 02:00:27,680
beats I think would be a good way of putting a classifying slate you can't

1366
02:00:27,680 --> 02:00:39,180
really classify him he's pretty fun guy yeah so I don't know but anyways huh so

1367
02:00:39,180 --> 02:00:45,600
I think that's pretty much all the news Oh Poppins 12 I don't know a little

1368
02:00:45,600 --> 02:00:49,280
piece of news I want to share going on actually this is posted to our site by

1369
02:00:49,280 --> 02:00:53,040
our very own news guy dark Tetsuya who does a lot of the news for the site we

1370
02:00:53,040 --> 02:00:56,300
really appreciate him helping out over orange laundry calm I don't know if you

1371
02:00:56,300 --> 02:00:59,760
guys remember this but way back in the beginnings of the show I'm talking like

1372
02:00:59,760 --> 02:01:03,460
two years ago back in the first like 10 20 episodes you guys remember twin

1373
02:01:03,460 --> 02:01:10,500
galaxies yeah I noticed that that back yeah twin galaxies now they are the site

1374
02:01:10,500 --> 02:01:15,540
that does all the high scores for games video games I'm not talking about just

1375
02:01:15,540 --> 02:01:18,340
like new video games I'm talking about old video games too we actually probably

1376
02:01:18,340 --> 02:01:22,140
the last time we brought them up on the show was during classic gaming Expo

1377
02:01:22,140 --> 02:01:27,240
earlier this year. Remember when we all participated in the Stampede challenge? Which, by the way,

1378
02:01:27,240 --> 02:01:30,520
I never checked to see if the scores were on, because I, are they?

1379
02:01:30,520 --> 02:01:36,000
They were, and you did check. Oh, okay, I don't remember. I'm going to have

1380
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:39,720
to pull that up again, because I remember that I was in, like, the bottom three. I swear

1381
02:01:39,720 --> 02:01:43,640
I did so horrible at Stampede. I was somewhere in, like, the teens for the

1382
02:01:43,640 --> 02:01:49,320
rankings for Gradius 5 also. Very, very nice. How does that make your internet

1383
02:01:49,320 --> 02:01:53,840
penis field, to be in the top 20 Gradius 5 players, officially.

1384
02:01:53,840 --> 02:01:58,120
That's pretty sad since I don't play Gradius, Gradius 5, that was the first time I'd ever

1385
02:01:58,120 --> 02:02:05,880
played Gradius 5. That's not saying much.

1386
02:02:05,880 --> 02:02:11,880
Alright, so Twin Galaxies is back in the news. Apparently, a brand new record has been set,

1387
02:02:11,880 --> 02:02:19,280
and I'm actually going to the link, which is a link actually to a post over on aaroninjapan.com,

1388
02:02:19,280 --> 02:02:22,620
And they actually quote, and if you want to see all this for yourself, it's all posted

1389
02:02:22,620 --> 02:02:23,980
over at OrangeLawnTrader.com.

1390
02:02:23,980 --> 02:02:28,780
They actually posted a story from Twin Galaxies, where apparently, what is the guy's name?

1391
02:02:28,780 --> 02:02:34,960
Gregory Cantor of Pennsylvania in the US, hey that's where I spent some time this year.

1392
02:02:34,960 --> 02:02:39,740
You know, funny enough, I didn't see any good DDR machines while I was out there, but apparently

1393
02:02:39,740 --> 02:02:44,460
I was checking all the wrong places, so it was my own damn fault, but this guy in Pennsylvania

1394
02:02:44,460 --> 02:02:51,820
has just set the new record for DDR Extreme. And basically the way the rules work, this

1395
02:02:51,820 --> 02:02:56,380
is the way the official rules work for you to get ranked. You have to be playing on easy,

1396
02:02:56,380 --> 02:03:02,340
difficulty three. It's a five song set. Game over has to be turned on. You get to play

1397
02:03:02,340 --> 02:03:06,640
your choice of songs, but you have to be on heavy mode. The gamer is allowed to take as

1398
02:03:06,640 --> 02:03:12,640
much time in between sets as the timer allows. No song can be picked more than two times

1399
02:03:12,640 --> 02:03:17,020
in the performance. The selection and sequence of songs is the player's choice. Player's

1400
02:03:17,020 --> 02:03:21,920
hands may not touch the dance pad. The bar is okay though. Only the player's feet may

1401
02:03:21,920 --> 02:03:27,600
touch the dance pad. So this is how the guy did it. He played max 300, max unlimited,

1402
02:03:27,600 --> 02:03:33,280
Sakura, bag, paranoia rebirth. So basically he played every 10 footer in the game. Is

1403
02:03:33,280 --> 02:03:40,160
rebirth a 10 or is rebirth a 9? So he played, are you sure? Alright, so he played four 10s

1404
02:03:40,160 --> 02:03:46,720
was a nine. And he ended up with a, what were they, actually, if you read on in the thread

1405
02:03:46,720 --> 02:03:50,000
they don't think it's Tsugaru, they think it's actually Sakura, not Tsugaru, which will

1406
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:53,820
make more sense anyway for somebody to pick Sakura because it's a ten. So this guy got

1407
02:03:53,820 --> 02:03:59,760
a score of 375,311,150 points, which is a lot of points. I know a lot of you guys don't

1408
02:03:59,760 --> 02:04:03,880
keep track of your points on DDR, you're all about the number of greats and things like

1409
02:04:03,880 --> 02:04:09,520
that, but this guy did a pretty good job. I believe the person that had had the record

1410
02:04:09,520 --> 02:04:16,180
before this was Yasu. If I'm not mistaking, didn't he remember when we first brought this

1411
02:04:16,180 --> 02:04:20,060
up on the show it was some other guy who had a really, really low record and we were all

1412
02:04:20,060 --> 02:04:23,780
making fun of how we were going to beat it. And then Yasu came in and kicked all our asses

1413
02:04:23,780 --> 02:04:28,660
basically. So that's why this is such big news. If, if I recall, and I may be wrong,

1414
02:04:28,660 --> 02:04:33,040
but, because maybe it's a Max 2 versus Extreme thing, I don't know. You know any more about

1415
02:04:33,040 --> 02:04:34,040
this, Logie?

1416
02:04:34,040 --> 02:04:37,700
That was Max 2 and I remember correctly and the rules were different then. I think the

1417
02:04:37,700 --> 02:04:43,700
the rules where you can't play a song more than twice in a row. Or twice, I think. Because

1418
02:04:43,700 --> 02:04:48,420
I think he played Max Unlimited twice or something like that. I don't know. It was stupid. Twin

1419
02:04:48,420 --> 02:05:00,420
Galaxies is stupid. I really don't care. That's my take on it. Very interesting. And now I'm

1420
02:05:00,420 --> 02:05:05,980
getting a message in our chat room over at www.orangelandtrader.com from DarkTetsuya.

1421
02:05:05,980 --> 02:05:11,200
Oh, sorry guys, it was Take, not Yasu that set the bar there, sorry.

1422
02:05:11,200 --> 02:05:16,260
You know what, both of them are insanely good at DDR, it's easy to get them confused because

1423
02:05:16,260 --> 02:05:20,260
you always hear about them together, you always hear about the two of them, so sorry about

1424
02:05:20,260 --> 02:05:21,260
that.

1425
02:05:21,260 --> 02:05:22,260
My bad, my bad.

1426
02:05:22,260 --> 02:05:27,900
But Dark Tetsuya says, uh, it seems like he may not have gotten parental permission.

1427
02:05:27,900 --> 02:05:34,340
And I didn't know, I certainly didn't have parental permission when I played Stampede.

1428
02:05:34,340 --> 02:05:38,720
My mother doesn't know I do this garbage. I don't know. You have to have parental permission

1429
02:05:38,720 --> 02:05:42,160
to be on a high score list? Is that what they're trying to say?

1430
02:05:42,160 --> 02:05:49,160
Something about child privacy law? Geez. That's kind of lame. I'm sorry, but

1431
02:05:49,960 --> 02:05:53,720
I think that's lame. Alright, we're going to go to a break, guys,

1432
02:05:53,720 --> 02:05:57,480
so when we come back from this break, we're going to get into the FUs of the week, because

1433
02:05:57,480 --> 02:06:02,600
we have to do that segment every week, because we're just angsty. We're angsty, angsty people,

1434
02:06:02,600 --> 02:06:03,760
and we have to get it out

1435
02:06:03,760 --> 02:06:06,880
uh... in this break we're getting here

1436
02:06:06,880 --> 02:06:09,520

Uh, sensation.

02:06:36,260 --> 02:06:38,800
Okay, if I can find it. Okay.

1447
02:06:38,800 --> 02:06:40,640

1453
02:06:49,920 --> 02:06:51,600

1454
02:06:51,600 --> 02:06:58,600
Orange Lounge Radio.

1455
02:08:21,600 --> 02:08:51,120
One, two, three, four!

1456
02:08:51,120 --> 02:09:19,340
Yeah

1457
02:09:49,340 --> 02:09:51,340
You

1458
02:11:19,340 --> 02:11:21,340
Oh

1459
02:11:49,340 --> 02:12:03,380
Hi ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

1460
02:12:03,380 --> 02:12:13,180
is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

1461
02:12:13,180 --> 02:12:17,060
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and a little follow-up to something we were talking

1462
02:12:17,060 --> 02:12:18,420
about earlier in the show.

1463
02:12:18,420 --> 02:12:22,620
I was actually checking out DERFreak over in the RViggle thread, I remember how we were

1464
02:12:22,620 --> 02:12:25,540
talking about 2DX possibly coming to Roswell Golf Land.

1465
02:12:25,540 --> 02:12:29,340
Our old buddy Iguana Girl, who's been on the show before, she actually made a post here

1466
02:12:29,340 --> 02:12:34,340
that says, I saw the precious precious sitting back in the tech room today.

1467
02:12:34,340 --> 02:12:38,140
It's a nice pretty little 2DX machine missing the monitor because they're replacing it.

1468
02:12:38,140 --> 02:12:41,380
It's currently in 8 style, but who knows what it'll be when it's up and running.

1469
02:12:41,380 --> 02:12:45,580
I smooched it to tell it I love it, and yes I humped it too, just like I did the Scandia

1470
02:12:45,580 --> 02:12:46,780
8 style when it first came in.

1471
02:12:46,780 --> 02:12:49,900
That's so good to know now.

1472
02:12:49,900 --> 02:12:51,060
So there it is.

1473
02:12:51,060 --> 02:12:53,380
It's got wifey poo humping on it.

1474
02:12:53,380 --> 02:12:53,880
Great.

1475
02:12:53,880 --> 02:12:54,380
That's happy.

1476
02:12:54,380 --> 02:12:57,460
Girl cooties on the 2DX machine.

1477
02:12:57,460 --> 02:12:58,260
Just kidding.

1478
02:12:58,260 --> 02:13:00,940
That makes it all the better.

1479
02:13:00,940 --> 02:13:02,060
So that's pretty exciting.

1480
02:13:02,060 --> 02:13:02,740
So there it is.

1481
02:13:02,740 --> 02:13:05,420
That's about as close to a confirmation as you can get.

1482
02:13:05,420 --> 02:13:10,060
When iguana girls hump it, you know it's the real deal.

1483
02:13:10,060 --> 02:13:12,260
All right.

1484
02:13:12,260 --> 02:13:13,780
So anyway, moving right along, I guess

1485
02:13:13,780 --> 02:13:19,420
going to get into the FUs of the week. So we're going to cue that up for you guys.

1486
02:13:19,420 --> 02:13:23,280
Remember, you guys can participate in the FUs of the week by sending a private message

1487
02:13:23,280 --> 02:13:29,520
to me, that's Skye in the chat room with your FU. And Jamie, why is it that we have to do

1488
02:13:29,520 --> 02:13:36,520
these FUs of the Week every single week. We're not going to take it anymore.

1489
02:13:50,520 --> 02:13:57,520
Oh, Big FU toured my overwhelming lack of free time the past week, however, now that

1490
02:13:57,520 --> 02:14:01,900
semester is over and I have one thing left to do it's great but then I just

1491
02:14:01,900 --> 02:14:07,080
realized that the classes that I need to take next semester are full term except

1492
02:14:07,080 --> 02:14:12,000
for one that's going to be second half so I'm going to be really freaking busy

1493
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:21,040
next semester and fu2 there being no free no time off allowed next month but

1494
02:14:21,040 --> 02:14:28,160
I might have to beg some anyway to take care of some school stuff just and if

1495
02:14:28,160 --> 02:14:32,320
you towards all the slow ass people on the road today oh yeah an F each of the

1496
02:14:32,320 --> 02:14:38,680
guy who tried to cut me off in traffic and then feel on his brakes on purpose

1497
02:14:38,680 --> 02:14:43,360
he's tailgating me so I slowed down so he goes around me and then gets it in

1498
02:14:43,360 --> 02:14:47,040
front of me and tries to throw on his brakes that I went into him thing is I

1499
02:14:47,040 --> 02:14:51,720
drive a Tercel with bad brakes I was going 50 you know that would have been

1500
02:14:51,720 --> 02:14:55,920
like lethal so I luckily there's no one in the next place I swerved around them and it

1501
02:14:55,920 --> 02:14:58,640
turns out that I ended up being like five cars ahead of him in traffic anyway

1502
02:14:58,640 --> 02:15:07,160
so he got stuck behind like some old people in a Buick and F you toward not

1503
02:15:07,160 --> 02:15:20,040
having money time and certain things yeah that's really about it I just want

1504
02:15:20,040 --> 02:15:23,600
to point out for a minute if any of the OC remix people are listening this is

1505
02:15:23,600 --> 02:15:33,720
another one by Loki we're gonna get you we're gonna get you to whore yourself

1506
02:15:33,720 --> 02:15:39,480
yourself out. If you won't do it, damn it, we will. And on that note, let's go over to

1507
02:15:39,480 --> 02:15:40,480
Loki.

1508
02:15:40,480 --> 02:15:48,680
Whatever. I don't even care anymore. Fucking my work for making me bake cookies. I don't

1509
02:15:48,680 --> 02:15:52,520
like extracurricular activities no matter what they are, even if it involves cookies,

1510
02:15:52,520 --> 02:15:56,320
because the cookies I made, I don't like to eat. One, because they taste like lemons.

1511
02:15:56,320 --> 02:16:03,320
because they have nuts in them. It's not my forte. Anyway, um, I guess, fuck you, CarMax

1512
02:16:03,680 --> 02:16:07,920
for taking forever to fix my car. I didn't know, but I guess it takes two days to do

1513
02:16:07,920 --> 02:16:12,080
a fucking brake job. Whoa, what have I been doing? I must have been doing it completely

1514
02:16:12,080 --> 02:16:16,120
wrong because I get mine done in like an hour and a half. The only problem is I didn't know

1515
02:16:16,120 --> 02:16:19,960
I needed a brake job because I didn't know the fuck was wrong with my brake. Come to

1516
02:16:19,960 --> 02:16:25,280
find out, it's actually something when the person before me, or CarMax, who fucking knows,

1517
02:16:25,280 --> 02:16:29,120
my brakes they installed them incorrectly so the retainer clip was broken and thus the

1518
02:16:29,120 --> 02:16:35,600
pad was wearing funny causing me vibration noise thus resulting in my brake being worn

1519
02:16:35,600 --> 02:16:40,240
down on one side not the other side so i needed the front brake job but unfortunately i don't

1520
02:16:40,240 --> 02:16:46,400
have to do a front brake job later because i got done now so good for that um and then

1521
02:16:46,400 --> 02:16:54,880
finally um since i don't really have that many fus this week um fuck you too uh let's see here

1522
02:16:54,880 --> 02:17:05,880
I know it's comin' here, comin', comin'. Um, you know, I can't think of what it was. Um, there's something that was really pissin' me off the other day, but I just cannot remember what it is right now. Um...

1523
02:17:07,880 --> 02:17:18,880
No, I-I don't remember. Oh, fuck, you know, my pads for generating static electricity and causing them not to work, because that's gonna be a pain in the ass to fix, and, uh, yeah, that really sucks.

1524
02:17:18,880 --> 02:17:25,880
So, that's all I've got for now. I'm sure I'll remember more later, but, uh, yeah. That sucks.

1525
02:17:28,880 --> 02:17:29,880
My turn.

1526
02:17:35,880 --> 02:17:41,880
Uh, F you to the fog, because fog is scary. And I don't like driving in the fog, because it's very scary.

1527
02:17:42,880 --> 02:17:43,880
Yes.

1528
02:17:43,880 --> 02:17:45,880
We saw a six car accident in the fog.

1529
02:17:45,880 --> 02:17:48,880
See, the fog is scary!

1530
02:17:48,880 --> 02:17:52,880
Fog is a cruel trick to be playing on us humans, so I say F you to fog.

1531
02:17:52,880 --> 02:17:57,880
And F you to, uh, angst.

1532
02:17:57,880 --> 02:18:03,880
And F you to the fact that I wasn't drinking last night, even though for once I was the person that didn't have to drive,

1533
02:18:03,880 --> 02:18:06,880
so I could have drank all I wanted, but I didn't, because I'm a pussy.

1534
02:18:06,880 --> 02:18:14,880
And, um, F you to complicated situations, because I keep finding myself in them, and I hate that.

1535
02:18:14,880 --> 02:18:18,880
I was going to add something on the fog thing.

1536
02:18:18,880 --> 02:18:24,880
What? A dude in a Mustang broke through one of our neighbor's fences.

1537
02:18:24,880 --> 02:18:29,880
Geez, see? F-Fog. Well, you've seen that exit.

1538
02:18:29,880 --> 02:18:33,880
Yeah. And see, now Seagrid in our chat room is saying,

1539
02:18:33,880 --> 02:18:36,880
Fog is sexy. It reminds me of Silent Hill.

1540
02:18:36,880 --> 02:18:40,880
Not when a zombie comes out and tries to, like, you know, rape you.

1541
02:18:40,880 --> 02:18:44,880
you it's and that's what happens when it's foggy out is you get raped by

1542
02:18:44,880 --> 02:18:51,960
zombies actually I do have to say one thing about fog if I may when I lived in

1543
02:18:51,960 --> 02:18:56,160
Alabama in in college at our dorms there's like a full globe of trees and

1544
02:18:56,160 --> 02:19:00,200
it would get so foggy there would play hide-and-seek in the fog that oh that

1545
02:19:00,200 --> 02:19:05,600
was really cool I would be so afraid of getting raped by zombies in the fog

1546
02:19:05,600 --> 02:19:12,600
right before Silent Hill. Still, zombie raping has been around forever.

1547
02:19:12,600 --> 02:19:15,600
Well, that will explain a few people who call where I work.

1548
02:19:15,600 --> 02:19:19,600
Alright, let's move on. Angel, you're FUs.

1549
02:19:19,600 --> 02:19:26,600
Um, yeah, I'll add another FU to the difficult situation thing, just because I hate that.

1550
02:19:26,600 --> 02:19:37,440
Um, F you to, um, yeah, F you to a parent that wants to be there but never was to begin

1551
02:19:37,440 --> 02:19:38,440
with.

1552
02:19:38,440 --> 02:19:44,360
I'm not talking about my parents, I'm talking about, um, my significant other's, uh, certain

1553
02:19:44,360 --> 02:19:45,360
parents.

1554
02:19:45,360 --> 02:19:50,800
Um, and, uh, you know what, they don't want you there, so stop trying, cause you never

1555
02:19:50,800 --> 02:19:51,800
tried anyway.

1556
02:19:51,800 --> 02:19:53,800
And, uh, that's it.

1557
02:19:53,800 --> 02:19:54,800
Alright.

1558
02:19:54,800 --> 02:19:58,880
All right, let's go on to the chat room FUs then

1559
02:19:59,960 --> 02:20:04,280
Dork says F you to myself for having a girl over and not doing anything about it

1560
02:20:06,400 --> 02:20:08,320
What lucky

1561
02:20:08,320 --> 02:20:14,920
Exactly that stuff will kick you till the day you die. Okay, just you gotta remember do it even if it seems wrong

1562
02:20:17,120 --> 02:20:18,800
Get the zombies to help

1563
02:20:18,800 --> 02:20:26,360
Darkknight says, my F.U. goes to the Greedy American Cable Company for trying to make

1564
02:20:26,360 --> 02:20:31,840

1566
02:20:35,860 --> 02:20:41,880

You had just had to do this to the white guy didn't you sue kill me moon phase?

1576
02:21:29,840 --> 02:21:36,160
John field says f you to the asshole who caused the pipe upstairs to burst my dorm room is flooded. Oh you are sued

1577
02:21:36,160 --> 02:21:39,460
Oh, you are so sued you ruined my stuff in its finals week

1578
02:21:39,460 --> 02:21:43,460
FU to the school as well for not keeping the maintenance on the pipes in this dorm.

1579
02:21:43,460 --> 02:21:46,460
You're sued as well if there isn't any compensation coming to me.

1580
02:21:48,460 --> 02:21:55,460
Illusion says FU to waking up at 4.30 in the morning because of a nightmare of some weird guy strangling a woman with floss.

1581
02:21:55,460 --> 02:21:59,460
Oh well, it led to my new short story being written.

1582
02:21:59,460 --> 02:22:03,460
FU to this stupid character analysis paper for the Scarlet Letter due tomorrow.

1583
02:22:03,460 --> 02:22:08,460
And finally a kind FU to DDR Angel for making that crappy bitch song win the cage match.

1584
02:22:08,460 --> 02:22:13,340
Sarah McLachlan was clearly the best song, but it was a kind f you do you alright so I

1585
02:22:14,820 --> 02:22:21,500
Can't say anything because I don't know I'm so whatever and besides they left the decision up to me anyway. That's right. You tell them

1586
02:22:24,820 --> 02:22:29,820
All right misty says f the movie theater that is one of only two in the groove machines in st

1587
02:22:29,820 --> 02:22:31,940
Louis for not having the machine on tonight

1588
02:22:31,940 --> 02:22:34,120
I'd rather play on shitty pads than not at all

1589
02:22:34,120 --> 02:22:39,120
Nice to see you finally give a damn about the machine's maintenance, though, and of course, F the cage match.

1590
02:22:39,120 --> 02:22:41,120
You're welcome.

1591
02:22:41,120 --> 02:22:46,120
Jaded2004 says F you to a broken rib, which equals no DDR for a month.

1592
02:22:46,120 --> 02:22:47,120
Ouch.

1593
02:22:47,120 --> 02:22:53,120
Seagurd says F you to a certain friend and his brother for not coming to terms with each of their sexuality.

1594
02:22:53,120 --> 02:22:55,120
They can make such a hot porn. Grr.

1595
02:22:55,120 --> 02:22:58,120
F you to not having WarioWare DS.

1596
02:22:58,120 --> 02:23:00,120
Played my friend's copy and it's the best game ever.

1597
02:23:00,120 --> 02:23:03,120
Wait, when did that come out? WarioWare DS is not out.

1598
02:23:03,120 --> 02:23:14,040
not out. What? Um, not that I know of. Maybe in Japan. Maybe. Maybe in Japan. Details please.

1599
02:23:14,040 --> 02:23:18,480
It might be out in Japan. Finally, F you to not getting enough sleep. Damn you, Final

1600
02:23:18,480 --> 02:23:26,480
Fantasy XI, it's all your fault. Alright, moving on. Oh, what? Dark Sakura? I smell

1601
02:23:26,480 --> 02:23:33,040
all of a sudden I smell vanilla blark says f you to people who keep saying

1602
02:23:33,040 --> 02:23:35,800
they're bored all the time it pisses off people who don't have time to do

1603
02:23:35,800 --> 02:23:39,760
anything if you're bored go read some books and stop telling everyone you have

1604
02:23:39,760 --> 02:23:42,320
nothing to do

1605
02:23:44,040 --> 02:23:49,080
oh they said in the chat room it's the Japanese version of WarioWare DS just

1606
02:23:49,080 --> 02:23:55,120
confirmation there and dark Tetsuya says f you to my dance pad it might be broken

1607
02:24:25,120 --> 02:24:30,440
and jazz says f you to Saturday holy crap what a horrible day you were I had

1608
02:24:30,440 --> 02:24:34,240
my first online final at 9 o'clock in the morning so I got up early and went

1609
02:24:34,240 --> 02:24:38,240
to school around 7 so I could get food and study during this process I locked

1610
02:24:38,240 --> 02:24:41,400
my keys in my car and need to call triple-a I would have just called my

1611
02:24:41,400 --> 02:24:44,260
parents but they were conveniently in Reno for the weekend after that I

1612
02:24:44,260 --> 02:24:47,480
completely botched my final and proceed to go home and drown my sorrows and

1613
02:24:47,480 --> 02:24:53,900
sleep in World of Warcraft and after that it got cut off but they have to do

1614
02:24:53,900 --> 02:24:56,540
the world of warcraft i don't want to hear about it anyway

1615
02:24:56,540 --> 02:24:58,200
i'm a little bitter towards that game

1616
02:24:58,200 --> 02:25:03,500
i'm sure it's a great game i've heard a lot of good things about it

1617
02:25:03,500 --> 02:25:04,800
anyway that's it

1618
02:25:04,800 --> 02:25:06,620
i'm looking at the Nevada girl

1619
02:25:06,620 --> 02:25:09,940
and this is the link you had me post in the chatroom earlier during the last broadcast

1620
02:25:09,940 --> 02:25:14,960
there's an eleven year old that killed a twelve year old in her class

1621
02:25:14,960 --> 02:25:19,540
in japan and now she's like an internet celebrity

1622
02:25:19,540 --> 02:25:23,020
and they call her the Nevada girl. I've heard of this girl

1623
02:25:23,020 --> 02:25:26,720
sometimes time time i guess what happened to her

1624
02:25:26,720 --> 02:25:29,800
well they can't really do anything to her because the uh... age of criminal

1625
02:25:29,800 --> 02:25:32,040
responsibility in japan is fourteen

1626
02:25:32,040 --> 02:25:34,000
which actually was lowered from sixteen

1627
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:40,180
wait so when you kill somebody you can't be prosecuted

1628
02:25:40,180 --> 02:25:42,880
but they're still trying to decide what to do with her

1629
02:25:42,880 --> 02:25:44,800
uh...

1630
02:25:44,800 --> 02:25:45,840
but uh...

1631
02:25:45,840 --> 02:25:50,200
apparently she's a big internet celebrity now in japan and there's all kinds of fan art about her

1632
02:25:50,200 --> 02:25:56,880
I did post the links in my live journal, including a bunch of the fan art.

1633
02:25:56,880 --> 02:26:05,840
The site, and if someone will just retype this for me, it's www.shrinemaiden.com, slash,

1634
02:26:05,840 --> 02:26:13,760
and it's all in caps, Nevada underscore, and then capital A, the rest is lowercase, R-T-W-O-R-K.

1635
02:26:13,760 --> 02:26:14,760
I lost you.

1636
02:26:14,760 --> 02:26:15,760
Sorry.

1637
02:26:15,760 --> 02:26:19,760
www.shrinemaiden.com

1638
02:26:19,760 --> 02:26:23,760
slash, and then Nevada is all

1639
02:26:23,760 --> 02:26:27,760
capitalized, underscore, N-E-V-A-D-A like

1640
02:26:27,760 --> 02:26:31,760
the state. Nevada, okay, underscore. And then Artwork, capital A.

1641
02:26:31,760 --> 02:26:35,760
The rest is lowercase. That's the site. That's it?

1642
02:26:35,760 --> 02:26:39,760
That's all that they had art.

1643
02:26:39,760 --> 02:26:43,760
There it is, in the chat room, just for you guys.

1644
02:26:43,760 --> 02:26:48,920
that yeah that's it I have some suggestions from the chat room dark night

1645
02:26:48,920 --> 02:26:51,120
says here's a suggestion send her to a shrink

1646
02:26:51,120 --> 02:26:58,760
Ram says the girl needs counseling big time there you go apparently she killed

1647
02:26:58,760 --> 02:27:04,520
her with a box cutter hope you have a pleasant Sunday night everybody but I

1648
02:27:04,520 --> 02:27:08,580
just find it funny that there's all kinds like look at one of these Rob okay

1649
02:27:08,580 --> 02:27:17,460
I'm looking. She looks so sweet and innocent. She looks sweet and innocent and chibi in

1650
02:27:17,460 --> 02:27:22,900
that picture and she's holding a little box cutter behind her back. That is, that's disturbing.

1651
02:27:22,900 --> 02:27:31,660
That is downright scary. Oh my god. Ugh. Loki, why do you find that so damn funny? Because

1652
02:27:31,660 --> 02:27:35,660
She has a box cutter and she killed a kid, and now she's famous.

1653
02:27:35,660 --> 02:27:37,660
That's sad! It's not funny, it's sad!

1654
02:27:37,660 --> 02:27:43,660
Yeah, really, she's not like the ugly, red-headed kid that killed some stupid kid and then posed his body in, like, uh...

1655
02:27:43,660 --> 02:27:46,660
He was on, uh, 48 hours last night.

1656
02:27:46,660 --> 02:27:49,660
Okay, let's go up on the webcam now.

1657
02:27:51,660 --> 02:27:56,660
And the webcam, of course, is available over at www.orangelongeradio.com.

1658
02:27:56,660 --> 02:28:00,660
And please don't get to see my uber-leet precious... my laptop.

1659
02:28:00,660 --> 02:28:04,660
Alright, we're going to go to a break, and when we come back, why don't we do some Ask

1660
02:28:04,660 --> 02:28:05,940
Orange Lounge? How's that sound?

1661
02:28:05,940 --> 02:28:10,020
Works for me. Yeah. And we'll open up the Skype line as well

1662
02:28:10,020 --> 02:28:15,660
for some comments. In this break, I've been letting Jamie pick all the songs tonight, so we're going to do some songs I want to hear now.

1663
02:28:15,660 --> 02:28:19,180
And we're going to start off with Candy. I want to hear Candy.

1664
02:28:19,180 --> 02:28:22,580
And it's Happy. And

1665
02:28:22,580 --> 02:28:27,220
when I hear Candy, I think of killing people with box cutters, so here you go.

1666
02:28:27,220 --> 02:28:30,300
We'll be back. Can we call you Rob Tan?

1667
02:28:30,300 --> 02:28:30,800
heh

1668
02:30:30,300 --> 02:30:37,300
We will live it in your eyes Return all the pages

1669
02:30:37,300 --> 02:30:47,300
If the end comes to us, never end it's only us

1670
02:30:47,300 --> 02:30:54,300
Never end it's only us

1671
02:30:54,300 --> 02:31:08,300
Try to keep their secrets, when I fall behind the clouds

1672
02:31:08,300 --> 02:31:21,300
There upon the rainbow The answer to my never-ending story

1673
02:31:21,300 --> 02:31:28,300
Never ending story

1674
02:32:51,300 --> 02:32:52,300
Hey!

1675
02:32:52,300 --> 02:32:53,300
Hey!

1676
02:32:53,300 --> 02:32:54,300
Hey!

1677
02:32:54,300 --> 02:32:55,300
Hey!

1678
02:32:55,300 --> 02:32:56,300
Hey!

1679
02:32:56,300 --> 02:32:58,300
Hey!

1680
02:33:26,300 --> 02:33:41,300
Orange Lounge Radio, can we put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it?

1681
02:33:41,300 --> 02:33:50,300
My God, you people are scary, looking at that cosplay and dojinshi.

1682
02:33:50,300 --> 02:33:53,300
I'm going to cosplay her in front of me.

1683
02:33:53,300 --> 02:33:58,500
she's 11 years old. What's this talk of cartoon vagina in the chatroom?

1684
02:33:58,500 --> 02:34:02,660
Some of the pictures are of the more hentai nature.

1685
02:34:02,660 --> 02:34:07,580
Gross! As if I didn't have reason enough to be gay.

1686
02:34:07,580 --> 02:34:11,380
Honestly, people. But some of the pictures are just so adorable

1687
02:34:11,380 --> 02:34:15,300
and it's so wrong that there's this whole fandom. Not the hentai one.

1688
02:34:15,300 --> 02:34:19,460
I'm planning on cosplaying in mockery of the fandom.

1689
02:34:19,460 --> 02:34:26,820
Yeah. Sure. So I just got an email from Midihead. Apparently, his broadcast went pretty good,

1690
02:34:26,820 --> 02:34:30,820
but he didn't get a chance to record it. I guess he was having technical difficulties

1691
02:34:30,820 --> 02:34:35,600
right up to the last minute. Hey! Just like this show! What do you know? But maybe we'll

1692
02:34:35,600 --> 02:34:40,180
be able to do something with Midihead another time. Because he's a fun guy. We like him.

1693
02:34:40,180 --> 02:34:45,780
And really, I would love any old DDR artist to be able to use this station as an outlet

1694
02:34:45,780 --> 02:34:50,720
to do some fun stuff because we'll whore ourselves for baloney artists because we like the music

1695
02:34:50,720 --> 02:34:55,860
you guys do. What can we say? That's why we're here. Anyway, one other thing we whore ourselves

1696
02:34:55,860 --> 02:35:01,580
to is the listenership and one way we allow the listeners to give back and be a part of

1697
02:35:01,580 --> 02:35:14,580
the show is to ask Orange Lounge. Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question. What will

1698
02:35:14,580 --> 02:35:17,100
We find out tonight on orange that owns radio

1699
02:35:17,640 --> 02:35:24,700
All I know is that I hope that the station doesn't disconnect because if it does then we won't be having this segment again

1700
02:35:24,940 --> 02:35:26,940
tonight

1701
02:35:32,180 --> 02:35:35,060
Oh my god, there's a picture of who's one of the battle royale girls

1702
02:35:36,140 --> 02:35:42,620
Okay, and jazz is the first question tonight and he's basically asking the same thing. He was just we were just talking about

1703
02:35:42,620 --> 02:35:52,860
about, saying, why is there a Nevada vagina action? And am I bad for laughing at this?

1704
02:35:52,860 --> 02:35:57,500
And it's a little picture of the girl done in ASCII art that you could use in your signature

1705
02:35:57,500 --> 02:36:03,060
on a forum if you wanted to. I could copy and paste that in IRC if I was feeling dumb,

1706
02:36:03,060 --> 02:36:08,260
but I'm not going to. I think it's cute, I don't think there's any reason to laugh, or

1707
02:36:38,260 --> 02:36:42,260
But, I don't know about the anime shirts. See, any ideas, Jamie?

1708
02:36:44,260 --> 02:36:47,260
That's disgusting. Jamie, any ideas about the anime shirts?

1709
02:36:47,260 --> 02:36:49,260
Oh, no. Go to San Francisco.

1710
02:36:49,260 --> 02:36:51,260
Low-key?

1711
02:36:53,260 --> 02:36:57,260
Um, you might try. Depends on what you're looking for. If you're looking for, um...

1712
02:36:58,260 --> 02:37:00,260
I guess it would depend on what series you're looking for.

1713
02:37:00,260 --> 02:37:06,260
Because a lot of the film companies like ADV and stuff, they put out t-shirts along with their DVDs and stuff.

1714
02:37:06,260 --> 02:37:14,260
So a site where you'd buy them, you'd probably be able to get the t-shirts from. I've tried maybe writestuff.com, and I think that's stuff with one F.

1715
02:37:14,260 --> 02:37:23,260
And, um, yeah, I think you might try there. And just do fucking Google search. Anime t-shirts. I'm sure you'll pull that shit up.

1716
02:37:23,260 --> 02:37:25,260
Alright.

1717
02:37:27,260 --> 02:37:33,260
You did not just say there's a bukkake picture. That is disgusting. Let me see it. I have to see it now.

1718
02:37:33,260 --> 02:37:43,260
to see it now. Oh my God, I'm going to die. Okay, Misty has a question. Oh my God, that's

1719
02:37:43,260 --> 02:37:57,260
disgusting! I'm done with this show, I'm so done. Alright. I hate to say it, but some

1720
02:37:57,260 --> 02:38:01,860
of them are just pretty funny. Alright, now simmer down for a minute, let's listen to

1721
02:38:31,860 --> 02:38:33,780
It doesn't matter if it's arcade or console.

1722
02:38:33,780 --> 02:38:37,180
Hell, give both if you remember.

1723
02:38:37,180 --> 02:38:38,980
Probably Castlevania.

1724
02:38:38,980 --> 02:38:40,220
Castlevania was my first.

1725
02:38:40,220 --> 02:38:44,540
Or Twinbeats, actually as it was on the NES, Stinger.

1726
02:38:44,540 --> 02:38:45,740
Mm, Stinger.

1727
02:38:45,740 --> 02:38:47,940
I vividly remember getting Castlevania

1728
02:38:47,940 --> 02:38:50,380
for my birthday or something for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

1729
02:38:50,380 --> 02:38:51,820
That was the first Konami game I had.

1730
02:38:51,820 --> 02:38:52,660
You remember?

1731
02:38:52,660 --> 02:38:55,160
I don't know if you remember this, but on the 8-bit Nintendo,

1732
02:38:55,160 --> 02:38:58,420
the Konami games came in a unique sort of packaging,

1733
02:38:58,420 --> 02:39:01,220
sort of like the old Activision cartridges and the Atari 2600.

1734
02:39:01,220 --> 02:39:06,220
all look the same. So did the Konami. They were all gray. You remember that? Yeah. So

1735
02:39:06,220 --> 02:39:10,500
I remember Castlevania was the first of those games that I owned. Angel. The only one I

1736
02:39:10,500 --> 02:39:18,060
remember, I know this is completely lame because it's one of the later games, but Contra. Contra

1737
02:39:18,060 --> 02:39:20,700
was probably the second. I used to play the hell out of Contra. Contra was probably the

1738
02:39:20,700 --> 02:39:25,140
second. In fact, as far as arcade games go, I would probably say Contra versus would be

1739
02:39:25,140 --> 02:39:28,700
the first. That I remember, really. I mean, there might have been, because Konami did

1740
02:39:28,700 --> 02:39:32,500
a lot of games in the early 80s too and I just don't remember what they did. So that

1741
02:39:32,500 --> 02:39:37,740
one I remember. You remember how on the Pay Choice 10 you could play the old school Nintendo

1742
02:39:37,740 --> 02:39:43,620
games? Yeah. Yeah. I remember playing Contra on one of those ones. Loki, you remember?

1743
02:39:43,620 --> 02:39:50,180
My first game was Life Force. It was one of the first three games I had on, or one of

1744
02:39:50,180 --> 02:39:58,680
first few games I had on Nintendo, because I got, what was it, it was Breakthrough, Zelda,

1745
02:39:58,680 --> 02:40:02,220
and I think Life Force were the first three games I had on Nintendo. Of course, we know

1746
02:40:02,220 --> 02:40:09,380
Life Force also as a salamander. Yes I know, but this was Life Force, not salamander.

1747
02:40:09,380 --> 02:40:15,220
It's just like how, what got me into DDR were the games Bust a Groove, and I know it's Bust

1748
02:40:15,220 --> 02:40:19,140
a Move in Japan, but when I played it, it was Bust a Groove. I didn't even know there

1749
02:40:19,140 --> 02:40:24,480
was an import scene until I got into this DDR stuff so I guess that's one way

1750
02:40:24,480 --> 02:40:28,920
you could put it. And I know Jamie loves it when I call it Busta Groove. Busta

1751
02:40:28,920 --> 02:40:33,840
Groove, Busta Groove, Busta Groove. I just got the finger. Alright, Blarg has a

1752
02:40:33,840 --> 02:40:42,080
question. I'm not... Jesus. Leave it to Blarg. I'm not sure if this has been asked

1753
02:40:42,080 --> 02:40:46,520
before but would any of you participate in some bukkake action if given the

1754
02:40:46,520 --> 02:40:49,860
p.s. i'm not offering no

1755
02:40:49,860 --> 02:40:53,920
how do you know we haven't already

1756
02:40:53,920 --> 02:40:55,920
i don't think so

1757
02:40:55,920 --> 02:40:59,560
unless it's like cake frosting bukkake or something

1758
02:40:59,560 --> 02:41:01,240
cuz cake frosting is yummy

1759
02:41:01,240 --> 02:41:02,840
as opposed to... yes?

1760
02:41:02,840 --> 02:41:05,500
sushi

1761
02:41:05,500 --> 02:41:06,780
what the hell

1762
02:41:06,780 --> 02:41:09,800
you don't remember the sushi down there

1763
02:41:09,800 --> 02:41:10,920
i remember

1764
02:41:10,920 --> 02:41:13,120
down the street i remember

1765
02:41:13,120 --> 02:41:19,520
that's disgusting. You're the one that mentioned it too. Our listeners have way too much free

1766
02:41:19,520 --> 02:41:24,200
time on their hands. You need to go read a book or something. Take the other guy's advice.

1767
02:41:24,200 --> 02:41:29,020
All right. John Fields has a question. If you had your choice of getting sucked inside

1768
02:41:29,020 --> 02:41:35,420
your TV and ending up inside of a video game, non-bomani and non-porn, Loki, no bubble bath

1769
02:41:35,420 --> 02:41:42,100
babes for you, what game would it be? What game would it be? If you had to get sucked

1770
02:41:42,100 --> 02:41:47,120
your TV into a video game any thoughts this is a weird question this is such a

1771
02:41:47,120 --> 02:41:55,840
nerd question angel I have to go first cuz I'm making you Jamie are you gonna

1772
02:41:55,840 --> 02:41:59,600
participate tonight show I'm sorry this is funny if you got had to get sucked

1773
02:41:59,600 --> 02:42:06,760
into any video game what would it be and it sucks into any video game non-bomani

1774
02:42:06,760 --> 02:42:11,800
non porn the nerdiest this is one of the top three nerdiest questions I think

1775
02:42:11,800 --> 02:42:24,320
we've ever gotten. I honestly couldn't say. Um. Probably. Plea peel. It's gonna be cool

1776
02:42:24,320 --> 02:42:27,600
just to walk along through the forest and solve all your problems by having a friendly

1777
02:42:27,600 --> 02:42:35,320
puzzle game. Angel. I was gonna say Mr. Driller just because that's the game I can't stop

1778
02:42:35,320 --> 02:42:39,760
playing right now, but that just doesn't sound right. You'd be drilling all day long and

1779
02:42:39,760 --> 02:42:42,360
and then you suffocate and fly away like a little angel.

1780
02:42:42,360 --> 02:42:45,960
I'm good at suffocating if you've ever watched me play.

1781
02:42:45,960 --> 02:42:48,960
Loki.

1782
02:42:48,960 --> 02:42:52,380
Um...

1783
02:42:52,380 --> 02:42:56,640
I would have to say...

1784
02:42:56,640 --> 02:43:00,440
I just put me in rumble roses because...

1785
02:43:00,440 --> 02:43:01,560
I can just...

1786
02:43:01,560 --> 02:43:03,000
Non-porn!

1787
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:04,600
That's not porn!

1788
02:43:04,600 --> 02:43:05,940
Fuck that shit!

1789
02:43:05,940 --> 02:43:07,920
I ain't porn!

1790
02:43:07,920 --> 02:43:14,920
You'd be perfect for Grand Theft Auto!

1791
02:43:37,920 --> 02:43:54,400
I would have to say Burger Time, because hamburgers are yummy. No, I'm kidding. Dark Tetsuya

1792
02:43:54,400 --> 02:43:58,480
said that in the chat room, so I had to say that. No, actually, I already had some answers

1793
02:43:58,480 --> 02:44:04,240
thought of. Legend of Zelda, because that was just such a cute game. Or, I would have

1794
02:44:04,240 --> 02:44:09,520
to say Pokemon, because it's very similar to Jamie, what if we could just settle our

1795
02:44:09,520 --> 02:44:13,480
scores by having our pets do battle instead of us, you know, just have our pets...

1796
02:44:13,480 --> 02:44:18,480
Dude, Jeremy would sit on whatever pet you had and win.

1797
02:44:18,480 --> 02:44:19,480
Or...

1798
02:44:19,480 --> 02:44:21,480
Jeremy's like Snorax or whatever it was called.

1799
02:44:21,480 --> 02:44:25,480
Or Final Fantasy IV, because I just have so many good memories about that game.

1800
02:44:25,480 --> 02:44:29,160
And I practically did live that game back when I was a kid.

1801
02:44:29,160 --> 02:44:31,960
When I was a kid, I did live that game, okay, so what can I say?

1802
02:44:31,960 --> 02:44:40,960
I just thought of another good one from the old school, Kid Icarus or Icarus or whatever the heck you want to pronounce it, you know.

1803
02:44:40,960 --> 02:44:46,960
That was a good one. I like some of the answers the chat room is giving. Evil Naoki 2DX says, I'd be in Katamari Damacy.

1804
02:44:46,960 --> 02:44:47,960
Oh!

1805
02:44:47,960 --> 02:44:49,960
Leisure Suit Larry.

1806
02:44:53,960 --> 02:44:57,960
Or BMX Triple X. Nah, BMX Triple X is too much work. Leisure Suit Larry.

1807
02:44:57,960 --> 02:45:05,480
DarklionXVI says, what do you think of my Dancer video I linked you last week?

1808
02:45:05,480 --> 02:45:11,720
Well, it was Dancer. I love Dancer. What can I say? Dancer is fabulous.

1809
02:45:11,720 --> 02:45:14,780
I highly recommend Dancer. Go ahead and post the link in our chat.

1810
02:45:14,780 --> 02:45:17,560
Let the chat people see it so that they can know what I'm talking about.

1811
02:45:17,560 --> 02:45:21,960
Oh, Jesus. Okay, here's a question from Seager.

1812
02:45:21,960 --> 02:45:24,480
Jamie, maybe you can answer this one. I don't know.

1813
02:45:24,480 --> 02:45:25,480
Let's see.

1814
02:45:25,480 --> 02:45:31,880
Uh, what's the best way to make two brothers have sex, and stay somewhat hidden with your video camera?

1815
02:45:34,280 --> 02:45:36,280
Drugs, lots of drugs.

1816
02:45:37,720 --> 02:45:38,780
Loki has a suggestion.

1817
02:45:39,580 --> 02:45:41,180
Ecstasy and alcohol.

1818
02:45:46,180 --> 02:45:51,480
Well, seriously, if you had them do enough ecstasy and alcohol, they would not be able to even see you there in the corner.

1819
02:45:51,480 --> 02:45:52,580
You'd just be another fixture.

1820
02:45:52,580 --> 02:45:55,820
you could like you could you know like in cartoons when they're trying to

1821
02:45:55,820 --> 02:46:00,380
disguise themselves you'd probably be able to join in you know how you could

1822
02:46:00,380 --> 02:46:05,060
disguise yourself as a palm tree or or as a lamp I'd like no no this was just

1823
02:46:05,060 --> 02:46:08,420
on drawn together the couple weeks ago you can disguise yourself as a lamp by

1824
02:46:08,420 --> 02:46:12,060
just putting a lamp shade on your head so you could do that and then have your

1825
02:46:12,060 --> 02:46:16,620
video camera there so and you're just a lamp

1826
02:46:16,620 --> 02:46:27,180
you guys are sick illusion has an orange lounge radio question

1827
02:46:27,180 --> 02:46:32,400
if you drop a kitty in a blender and you shuffle cards at the same time what are you guys doing

1828
02:46:32,400 --> 02:46:40,900
for new year's eve

1829
02:46:40,900 --> 02:46:44,820
blink blink dot dot dot i think there's only one part of that question

1830
02:46:44,820 --> 02:46:51,180
he needed to hear. Loki. Easy, that's what I'm doing for New Year's. Drop me a kitty

1831
02:46:51,180 --> 02:47:02,540
in a blender and shuffling cards. It's kitty smoothie and poker. Jamie, do you have a serious

1832
02:47:02,540 --> 02:47:08,220
answer for this poor question? I'm going to be heavily intoxicated. Yes, whatever I do

1833
02:47:08,220 --> 02:47:15,140
there will be drinking involved and hopefully sex if I get my way. Just not with two brothers,

1834
02:47:15,140 --> 02:47:20,620
because I'm not into that. Angel, you thinking over there? Do you have a plot, a plan?

1835
02:47:20,620 --> 02:47:26,900
Not for the kiddie questions, like whatever, but I don't know.

1836
02:47:26,900 --> 02:47:29,500
I think that was just a red herring. I don't think that was the actual question. I think

1837
02:47:29,500 --> 02:47:33,500
the question was New Year's Eve. All right. I don't know. I don't know what

1838
02:47:33,500 --> 02:47:37,900
I'm doing for New Year's or whatever. Maybe somebody will kidnap me so we can all have

1839
02:47:37,900 --> 02:47:44,700
a good time because kidnappings are fun I know this is like way late but I

1840
02:47:44,700 --> 02:47:51,100
remember two things I'm mad at and these are both movie related too I'm pissed

1841
02:47:51,100 --> 02:47:58,220
off at closer because Nellie Portman did not get naked and I'm also pissed off at

1842
02:47:58,220 --> 02:48:05,580
this other game or not this other show called a my life or yeah the life or

1843
02:48:05,580 --> 02:48:09,660
or something like that, starring Denise Richards, and she didn't get naked in that either! It's

1844
02:48:09,660 --> 02:48:16,940
a fucking underrated goddamn DVD! You're supposed to get naked! Naked! You're Playboy fucking

1845
02:48:16,940 --> 02:48:21,540
get naked on the goddamn- It's a foreign film, even! Where nudity's not even a big deal,

1846
02:48:21,540 --> 02:48:27,620
but no! Just show your tits in fucking Playboy! You're the worst fucking magazine out there.

1847
02:48:27,620 --> 02:48:33,020
Next to Entertainment Weekly. Anyways.

1848
02:48:33,020 --> 02:48:39,520
New Year's Eve? Uh, probably watch TV. What did we do last year? I watched an Iron Chef

1849
02:48:39,520 --> 02:48:46,520
marathon and then we had sex. That sounds like the perfect way to spend New Year's Eve.

1850
02:48:46,520 --> 02:48:52,380
I can't remember if it was New Year's or that was how I spent Halloween. It was one of those

1851
02:48:52,380 --> 02:49:00,380
holidays we watched an Iron Chef marathon and had sex. That could have been both, actually.

1852
02:49:00,380 --> 02:49:01,380
Wow.

1853
02:49:01,380 --> 02:49:03,980
Alright, anyway, that's fine.

1854
02:49:03,980 --> 02:49:07,820
I got invited to a party, so I'll probably go.

1855
02:49:07,820 --> 02:49:10,940
That's what I'm doing for New Year's.

1856
02:49:10,940 --> 02:49:15,780
Unless the chance to have sex comes up, then I will ditch everybody.

1857
02:49:15,780 --> 02:49:16,780
And it has to be good sex.

1858
02:49:16,780 --> 02:49:22,340
Eva Maoki 2DX says, speaking of internet crazes, ever heard of the OS girls?

1859
02:49:22,340 --> 02:49:27,740
If y'all don't know, basically people in Japan created anime mascots for different operating

1860
02:49:27,740 --> 02:49:32,480
systems but the real question what okay so have you guys ever heard of this they

1861
02:49:32,480 --> 02:49:37,600
have and what do you think they did one that was posted on I have fuck I don't

1862
02:49:37,600 --> 02:49:43,580
remember now I think it was on slash dot for Firefox and they did some furry for

1863
02:49:43,580 --> 02:49:49,760
that some shit I didn't get to see the other ones because the link that they

1864
02:49:49,760 --> 02:49:54,800
posted it to didn't I couldn't find them in person's gallery but it was

1865
02:49:54,800 --> 02:49:59,560
interesting. I think I, I want to say I posted that in my live journal, but I can't remember

1866
02:49:59,560 --> 02:50:00,560
if I did or not.

1867
02:50:00,560 --> 02:50:02,000
Nope, I know who posted it in their live journal.

1868
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:07,280
But, um, someone posted it in their live journal, and I'm going to show Rob here in the studio.

1869
02:50:07,280 --> 02:50:10,400
Well, actually, fuck, I'm going to have to, like, go through five pages of friend's stuff

1870
02:50:10,400 --> 02:50:18,440
to find it. Remember who posted that? Okay. Anyways, Rob talk and I'll find it.

1871
02:50:18,440 --> 02:50:22,580
Fine. The real question that, uh, even theAlky2DX wants to ask is, what do you all think of

1872
02:50:22,580 --> 02:50:30,780
internet crazes. I think they're funny. I think they're funny until they get old. I

1873
02:50:30,780 --> 02:50:34,500
mean, like, some things are getting old. Like, I'm sorry, because I know Jamie's a fan, but

1874
02:50:34,500 --> 02:50:40,980
I think Strong Bad is kind of old now. Did I say I was a fan? Well, I just know you quote

1875
02:50:40,980 --> 02:50:47,340
Strong Bad a lot. It's because I live with Dan, and Dan quotes Strong Bad a lot. I just

1876
02:50:47,340 --> 02:50:51,340
I just think Homestar Runner is kind of like so last year.

1877
02:50:51,340 --> 02:50:55,340
All right.

1878
02:50:55,340 --> 02:50:59,340
Anything else? Internet crazes? Anybody else have a comment on internet crazes?

1879
02:50:59,340 --> 02:51:03,340
No, because I can't think of any at the moment. How about the hamster dance?

1880
02:51:03,340 --> 02:51:07,340
That was like three years ago. That was the dancing baby.

1881
02:51:07,340 --> 02:51:11,340
Oh, okay, the dancing baby. Yeah, all right. Yeah, they're funny until they get old.

1882
02:51:11,340 --> 02:51:15,340
This is a scary comment from Dark Knight in the chatroom.

1883
02:51:15,340 --> 02:51:24,980
could see the chairman starting Loki's sex romp. You know from Iron Chef. Oh, I saw that

1884
02:51:24,980 --> 02:51:29,040
picture. There's the Firefox anime girl. Can you like just post a link to chat room or

1885
02:51:29,040 --> 02:51:37,740
something? Why not? Oh, you're not in chat. Oh, that sucks. Sucks to be you. Moving on

1886
02:51:37,740 --> 02:51:41,980
with the questions Ask Orange Lounge. If you have a question, you can send it to us via

1887
02:51:41,980 --> 02:51:46,320
private message in IRC or you can also give us a call on the skype line we're

1888
02:51:46,320 --> 02:51:48,780
going to open up the skype line for you boys and girls that want to give us a

1889
02:51:48,780 --> 02:51:54,780
call over there legend of Zaku says if I were to down this death brick called the

1890
02:51:54,780 --> 02:51:58,500
Hardee's monster thick burger burger I don't know if you've heard about this

1891
02:51:58,500 --> 02:52:04,300
other things are humongous I saw without nasty what only courses would I have to

1892
02:52:04,300 --> 02:52:08,780
do in order to burn off the 1400 plus calories that I'm taking in as a result

1893
02:52:08,780 --> 02:52:14,140
of this burger. All of them. Yeah, all of them, basically. I'll put it this way. Legend

1894
02:52:14,140 --> 02:52:19,660
rode five times. You would have to lift weights vigorously for four solid hours to burn off

1895
02:52:19,660 --> 02:52:26,100
that many calories. And I'm surprised, Loki, I'm looking at the site right now, I'm surprised,

1896
02:52:26,100 --> 02:52:31,680
and it's making that lightning noise right here. It's Hardee's.com, and I want Loki to

1897
02:52:31,680 --> 02:52:38,380
see this. It's the Monster Burger. Hardee's, of course, somewhat related to Carl's Jr.

1898
02:52:38,380 --> 02:52:43,580
the monster thick burger. Look at that. That's just a fucking Bacon Ultimate Cheeseburger.

1899
02:52:43,580 --> 02:52:49,660
That's all that is. It's more than a Bacon Ultimate Cheeseburger. They're pretty humongous.

1900
02:52:49,660 --> 02:52:54,580
They're larger than the $6 burger. Yeah, that's like two of those $6 patties right there,

1901
02:52:54,580 --> 02:53:03,260
and like, look at whatever that sauce is right there. Yikes. If you go to fucking Fuddruckers,

1902
02:53:03,260 --> 02:53:12,080
you can get one pound patties there okay so that burger ain't shit okay but yeah

1903
02:53:12,080 --> 02:53:17,960
that looks tasty. John Fields has a question hey what if the chat room forced

1904
02:53:17,960 --> 02:53:20,900
Orange Lounge Radio and you can stop right there because the chat room can't

1905
02:53:20,900 --> 02:53:24,980
force us to do nothing but we'll entertain the question what if the chat

1906
02:53:24,980 --> 02:53:29,240
room forced Orange Lounge Radio to do to a kids show like those you see on Nick

1907
02:53:29,240 --> 02:53:34,240
Nick Jr. because of tonight's cage match. What would it be like, what would it be like

1908
02:53:34,240 --> 02:53:38,260
if the show were on Nick Jr.? We wouldn't be on Nick Jr.

1909
02:53:38,260 --> 02:53:41,400
I would sell this show out to anybody that would take it and I know you guys would too

1910
02:53:41,400 --> 02:53:45,840
and if Nick Jr. was there, I would have a live studio audience filled with children

1911
02:53:45,840 --> 02:53:52,560
and I would make Dark Sakura lecture them on proper grammar all night.

1912
02:53:52,560 --> 02:53:59,520
and then have remedial class for their parents on how to do their fucking jobs.

1913
02:53:59,520 --> 02:54:07,320
Beautiful. Last question of the evening from Seagurd. Okay, a real question. Are there

1914
02:54:07,320 --> 02:54:16,400
any solid plans for an E3 show this year? Well, I guess one of the big questions is

1915
02:54:16,400 --> 02:54:22,040
if we even get to go to E3 in the first place, we know Dark Sakura gets to go. Loki and I

1916
02:54:22,040 --> 02:54:25,800
are pretty sure we're going to get to go again where with cards look good if you

1917
02:54:25,800 --> 02:54:28,920
went the year before you can go again so we're kind of hoping that can happen

1918
02:54:28,920 --> 02:54:31,460
so the answer is if we can get

1919
02:54:31,460 --> 02:54:35,000
everything we need which would include a laptop

1920
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:35,840
hit hit

1921
02:54:35,840 --> 02:54:37,980
hit hit jimmy

1922
02:54:37,980 --> 02:54:42,360
and we stay in a nice enough hotel this time where we're not in the motel six

1923
02:54:42,360 --> 02:54:45,540
in the middle of hollywood and we instead stay at a motel that has free high speed

1924
02:54:45,540 --> 02:54:47,260
internet access like a

1925
02:54:47,260 --> 02:54:48,460
motel seven

1926
02:54:48,460 --> 02:54:50,700
or at least a holiday in which i think has that

1927
02:54:50,700 --> 02:54:54,540
If we could do that, then yes, we could do a show, not necessarily from E3, but from

1928
02:54:54,540 --> 02:54:59,020
the hotel. But here's the other part of the question. Would we want to spend our time

1929
02:54:59,020 --> 02:55:04,340
in LA doing this program? I don't know. So, maybe. I think if worse comes to worse, we'll

1930
02:55:04,340 --> 02:55:08,540
do something, we'll do lots of tape segments from E3. We're trying to do more at E3 this

1931
02:55:08,540 --> 02:55:12,260
year, assuming we have to find out if we can go first. But if we can go, we're hoping to

1932
02:55:12,260 --> 02:55:19,180
get more interviews and some many more fun stuff at E3. But again, it's still December,

1933
02:55:19,180 --> 02:55:26,180
It's a little early, so we'll see soon enough.

1934
02:55:26,180 --> 02:55:30,980
Alright, that's gonna do it for tonight's Ask Orange Lounge segment.

1935
02:55:30,980 --> 02:55:35,980
What do you say we do another break? A quick break, and come back and wrap it up.

1936
02:55:35,980 --> 02:55:37,680
You guys okay with that?

1937
02:55:37,680 --> 02:55:38,580
Looks for me.

1938
02:55:38,580 --> 02:55:41,180
Alright, let's do a break, and in this break we're gonna hear...

1939
02:55:41,180 --> 02:55:45,480
I wanna hear something new. I wanna hear an UltraMix 2 song. Let's do...

1940
02:55:45,480 --> 02:55:48,280
I don't know, what song sounds good to you? Let's do the Delirium song,

1941
02:55:48,280 --> 02:55:50,280
Since we're having a delirium night.

1942
02:55:50,280 --> 02:55:52,280
How's that sound?

1943
02:55:52,280 --> 02:55:53,280
Oh, it's for me.

1944
02:55:53,280 --> 02:55:56,280
Alright, we will be right back after this to wrap it up.

1945
02:55:56,280 --> 02:55:58,280
Stay with us.

1946
02:55:58,280 --> 02:56:02,280
The best is yet to come because we all know the best part of the show is when it's over.

1947
02:56:28,280 --> 02:56:33,280
She's tired of smiling at me

1948
02:56:33,280 --> 02:56:37,280
I just decided to come back inside of me

1949
02:56:37,280 --> 02:56:40,280
And I think we're on our way

1950
02:56:40,280 --> 02:56:44,280
Cause tomorrow she does nothing inside

1951
02:56:44,280 --> 02:56:48,280
No good to give, no meaning to leave

1952
02:56:48,280 --> 02:56:51,280
I'm missing all of my nights

1953
02:56:51,280 --> 02:56:56,280
Everything runs out

1954
02:57:10,280 --> 02:57:15,280
After all these decades, do we say no?

1955
02:57:45,280 --> 02:58:02,280
Hello? Hello, is this thing on? Testing. Testing one, two.

1956
02:58:02,280 --> 02:58:06,280
I'm looking in the index, but I don't see anything for how to run a radio show.

1957
02:58:06,280 --> 02:58:10,280
Hello? I don't understand this. Does this thing work?

1958
02:58:10,280 --> 02:58:12,280
This thing reads like stereo instructions.

1959
02:58:12,280 --> 02:58:13,280
Is this on?

1960
02:58:13,280 --> 02:58:20,280
Orange Lounge Radio, broke down Get Opa Monte Radio.

1961
02:58:43,280 --> 02:58:47,360
get to get out of the hotel that is. We'll see. Anyway, we're going to wrap it up, but

1962
02:58:47,360 --> 02:58:52,360
we've got to get everybody's final thoughts. So we'll start with DDR Angel.

1963
02:58:52,360 --> 02:59:01,360
Well, I thought I'd bring up the game, or I can bring it up growing up for Skirt. That

1964
02:59:01,360 --> 02:59:06,120
game that I like and that I got to do this. My bad. I totally forgot about it. Bring it

1965
02:59:06,120 --> 02:59:09,040
up real quick. Tell the folks about it. What's it all about?

1966
02:59:09,040 --> 02:59:15,040
It's basically a side-scrolling RPG game called MapleStory.

1967
02:59:15,040 --> 02:59:17,040
A side-scrolling RPG?

1968
02:59:17,040 --> 02:59:18,040
Yeah.

1969
02:59:18,040 --> 02:59:19,040
What kind of a game?

1970
02:59:19,040 --> 02:59:23,040
It kind of reminded me of Mystical Ninja at first, but I don't know, it's pretty cool.

1971
02:59:23,040 --> 02:59:25,040
I mean, you can pick up coins and stuff, it's pretty cute.

1972
02:59:25,040 --> 02:59:28,040
It's one of those cutesy ones again, you know, like Ragnarok was.

1973
02:59:28,040 --> 02:59:32,040
It was cutesy and it was cool, and it still is cool, but you know.

1974
02:59:32,040 --> 02:59:34,040
I don't know. Anyway.

1975
02:59:34,040 --> 02:59:37,040
What was it? Maple... I can't think of the website now.

1976
02:59:37,040 --> 02:59:38,040
MapleStory?

1977
02:59:38,040 --> 02:59:41,220
you don't know the game's maple story

1978
02:59:41,220 --> 02:59:43,080
maple global diet

1979
02:59:43,080 --> 02:59:47,560
matter dot com

1980
02:59:47,560 --> 02:59:52,560
for those people don't check it out good maple global

1981
02:59:52,560 --> 02:59:54,280
may be stuck on

1982
02:59:54,280 --> 03:00:00,000
i think it's not com

1983
03:00:00,000 --> 03:00:07,000
evil maliki in our chat room says uh... maple story dot com

1984
03:00:11,400 --> 03:00:13,640
sounds interesting i might have to check this out

1985
03:00:13,640 --> 03:00:17,640
seems like a few people in our chat have heard of this before so we'll see

1986
03:00:17,640 --> 03:00:20,400
angel's gonna hook me up with that later so i can check it out

1987
03:00:20,400 --> 03:00:22,240
loki your final thought

1988
03:00:22,240 --> 03:00:25,520
oh i'm sorry angel is that your final thought pretty much

1989
03:00:25,520 --> 03:00:27,300
bye mr driller cause it's fun

1990
03:00:27,300 --> 03:00:28,820
loki your final thought

1991
03:00:28,820 --> 03:00:31,420
It is maplestory.com

1992
03:00:31,420 --> 03:00:33,220
My final thought is

1993
03:00:33,220 --> 03:00:35,900
I'm probably going to play some more Final Fantasy tonight

1994
03:00:35,900 --> 03:00:38,100
because

1995
03:00:38,100 --> 03:00:44,380
I like that game and I've spent so much time on it and yeah, that's all.

1996
03:00:44,380 --> 03:00:48,700
Jamie, my final thought is I'm probably going to do the same thing as soon as I take Angel home.

1997
03:00:48,700 --> 03:00:53,620
Jamie, your final thought. Actually, I have to run errands, which kind of sucks. Jamie, your final thought?

1998
03:00:53,620 --> 03:00:56,460
Um...

1999
03:00:56,460 --> 03:00:59,820
Nevada!

2000
03:00:59,820 --> 03:01:01,680
All right.

2001
03:01:01,680 --> 03:01:05,220
Now you know you're not going to have a final word. So I have to give the final word.

2002
03:01:05,220 --> 03:01:07,360
I have another one.

2003
03:01:07,360 --> 03:01:11,980
And thank you very much for listening everybody. Have a great night and thank you for supporting Orange Lounge Radio.

2004
03:01:11,980 --> 03:01:14,640
We'll see you back here next week. Have a happy holiday season.

2005
03:01:14,640 --> 03:01:19,440
And tune in all this week for more live programming here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2006
03:01:19,440 --> 03:01:22,480
Jamie, the final word of tonight's show.

2007
03:01:22,480 --> 03:01:24,220
Creamy.

2008
03:01:24,220 --> 03:01:29,780

And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.

2012
03:02:12,860 --> 03:02:15,860
He busted in, nearly scared him half to death

2013
03:02:15,860 --> 03:02:19,860
Had a rifle in his hands, and cheap whiskey on his breath

2014
03:02:19,860 --> 03:02:23,860
From his beard to his boots, he was covered with ammo

2015
03:02:23,860 --> 03:02:27,860
Like a big, fat, drunk, disgruntled, yuletide Rambo

2016
03:02:27,860 --> 03:02:31,860
And he smiled as he stared, with a twinkle in his eye

2017
03:02:31,860 --> 03:02:36,860
Merry Christmas to all, now you're all gonna die!

2018
03:02:36,860 --> 03:02:40,860
The night Santa went crazy

2019
03:02:40,860 --> 03:02:44,500
The night St. Nick went insane

2020
03:02:44,500 --> 03:02:48,500
Realized he'd been getting a raw meal

2021
03:02:48,500 --> 03:02:52,500
So he finally must've snapped in his brain

2022
03:02:53,000 --> 03:02:55,000
Well the workshop is gone now

2023
03:02:55,000 --> 03:02:57,000
He decided to bomb it

2024
03:02:57,000 --> 03:02:59,000
Everywhere you'll find pieces

2025
03:02:59,000 --> 03:03:01,000
Of cupid and comet

2026
03:03:01,000 --> 03:03:03,000
And he tied up his helpers

2027
03:03:03,000 --> 03:03:05,000
And he held the elves hostage

2028
03:03:05,000 --> 03:03:07,000
And he ground up for Rudolph

2029
03:03:07,000 --> 03:03:09,000
Into reindeer sausage

2030
03:03:09,000 --> 03:03:13,000
He got Dancer and Brandler with an old German Luger

2031
03:03:13,000 --> 03:03:17,000
And he slashed up Dasher just like Freddy Krueger

2032
03:03:17,000 --> 03:03:19,000
And he picked up a flame thrower

2033
03:03:19,000 --> 03:03:21,000
And he barbecued Blitzen

2034
03:03:21,000 --> 03:03:25,000
And he took a big bite and laid his head just like chicken

2035
03:03:25,000 --> 03:03:29,000
The night Santa went crazy

2036
03:03:29,000 --> 03:03:33,000
The night kids crinkled with Santa

2037
03:03:33,000 --> 03:03:37,000
You can't hardly walk around the North Pole

2038
03:03:37,000 --> 03:03:40,760
Without stepping in reindeer's blood

2039
03:03:40,760 --> 03:03:47,440
There's a National Guard and the FBI

2040
03:03:47,440 --> 03:03:50,960
There's a van from the eye with a zoo

2041
03:03:50,960 --> 03:03:55,320
And a helicopter circling round in the sky

2042
03:03:55,320 --> 03:03:59,640
And the bullets are flying, the spotting is rising

2043
03:03:59,640 --> 03:04:06,120
And everyone's dying to know who's better why

2044
03:04:06,120 --> 03:04:09,120
My, my, my, my, my, my

2045
03:04:09,120 --> 03:04:13,120
You used to be such a jolly guy

2046
03:04:20,120 --> 03:04:24,120
Yes, Virginia, now Santa's doin' time

2047
03:04:24,120 --> 03:04:28,120
In a federal prison, or is it summer's crime?

2048
03:04:28,120 --> 03:04:32,120
Hey, little friend, now, don't you cry no more tears

2049
03:04:32,120 --> 03:04:35,880
He'll be out with good behavior in seven hundred more years

2050
03:04:35,880 --> 03:04:39,880
But now makes him in therapy and Donner's so nervous

2051
03:04:39,880 --> 03:04:43,880
And the elbow got jobs working for the postal service

2052
03:04:43,880 --> 03:04:47,880
And the famous is why she's on the phone every night

2053
03:04:47,880 --> 03:04:52,380
When the lawyer negotiates the movie rights they talk about

2054
03:04:52,380 --> 03:04:59,880
The night span away craving the night St. Nicholas lived

2055
03:04:59,880 --> 03:05:03,880
Broke his back for some meltin' cookie

2056
03:05:03,880 --> 03:05:07,880
Felt to me like he was tired of gettin' sick, whoa

2057
03:05:07,880 --> 03:05:11,880
The night fennel went crazy

2058
03:05:11,880 --> 03:05:15,880
The night paint jig went insane

2059
03:05:15,880 --> 03:05:19,880
Realized he's been gettin' the wrong deal

2060
03:05:19,880 --> 03:05:23,880
Some finally must've snapped in his brain, whoa

2061
03:05:23,880 --> 03:05:27,880
Some finally must've snapped in his brain, tell ya

2062
03:05:27,880 --> 03:05:34,880
who finally put the sand in his brain.

2063
03:05:34,880 --> 03:05:53,260
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

2064
03:06:04,880 --> 03:06:17,800
The Orange Lounge Radio After Birth. Here it is, the part after the credits.

2065
03:06:17,800 --> 03:06:19,760
Any exciting plans for this week, Dark Sakura?

2066
03:06:19,760 --> 03:06:24,040
Sitting on my ass, maybe playing some Phantasy Star online.

2067
03:06:24,040 --> 03:06:28,640
Are you getting back into that? Yeah, I may as well. I'm still paying for

2068
03:06:28,640 --> 03:06:31,480
it. You know, episode four is being beta tested

2069
03:06:31,480 --> 03:06:32,840
right now. Oh, joy.

2070
03:06:32,840 --> 03:06:37,480
and apparently the card thing is gone. Good, because the card thing was retarded.

2071
03:06:37,480 --> 03:06:42,360
Oh my god. You know, this whole card craze thing...

2072
03:06:42,360 --> 03:06:45,340
horrible.

2073
03:06:45,340 --> 03:06:46,680
Yeah, I agree.

2074
03:06:46,680 --> 03:06:48,540
I agree.

2075
03:06:48,540 --> 03:06:50,060
The card thing was not good.

2076
03:06:50,060 --> 03:06:55,280
But we talked about that a little bit on Outside the Box a couple weeks ago, so, interesting.

2077
03:06:55,280 --> 03:07:02,280
uh... low-key any exciting plans for the week

2078
03:07:03,740 --> 03:07:10,100
angel you got any exciting plans this week you are pretty boring

2079
03:07:10,100 --> 03:07:16,860

2080
03:07:16,860 --> 03:07:19,320
man what do you do for fun

2081
03:07:19,320 --> 03:07:21,140
i don't know

2082
03:07:21,140 --> 03:07:23,540
you what i don't know that

2083
03:07:23,540 --> 03:07:24,740
i held a lot

2084
03:07:24,740 --> 03:07:29,140
I hella want Boba, but I can't go out for Boba tonight because I have errands to run.

2085
03:07:29,140 --> 03:07:32,500
I have to get up at 6.30, I'm sorry, 5.30 in the morning.

2086
03:07:32,500 --> 03:07:36,920
Boba sounds like a good time though, it really does.

2087
03:07:36,920 --> 03:07:42,220
Darn you for bringing it up!

2088
03:07:42,220 --> 03:07:43,940
Oh well, what can you do?

2089
03:07:43,940 --> 03:07:49,540
Alright, well I guess that's it, unless anybody else has anything exciting they want to add.

2090
03:07:49,540 --> 03:07:51,540
No? Alrighty then.

2091
03:07:51,540 --> 03:07:55,000
We're going to go back to our Bahmani Music and More program.

2092
03:07:55,000 --> 03:07:58,800
Commercial free tonight, boys and girls, for a little while after the show.

2093
03:07:58,800 --> 03:08:05,020
We're going to start it off, though, with something special, for those of you guys that stuck around, because I know a lot of you guys ditch us before the...

2094
03:08:05,020 --> 03:08:10,320
No, I want to play something kind of new, because it's new and desirable by people,

2095
03:08:10,320 --> 03:08:12,420
because you don't get to hear it a whole lot.

2096
03:08:12,420 --> 03:08:15,520
So we're actually going to play

2097
03:08:15,520 --> 03:08:17,240
that new remix,

2098
03:08:17,240 --> 03:08:19,600
which we haven't really played a whole lot here on the station.

2099
03:08:19,600 --> 03:08:21,800
So, some of you guys may actually not have heard it yet.

2100
03:08:21,800 --> 03:08:23,960
You know the junk circuit mix of I Feel?

2101
03:08:23,960 --> 03:08:25,380
You remember that one?

2102
03:08:25,380 --> 03:08:27,040
We're gonna play that for you guys

2103
03:08:27,040 --> 03:08:28,240
who stuck around for us.

2104
03:08:28,240 --> 03:08:29,520
And have a great night, everybody.

2105
03:08:29,520 --> 03:08:31,360
Thanks for tuning in and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.

2106
03:08:31,360 --> 03:08:32,200
Have a good one.

2107
03:08:34,280 --> 03:08:35,480
Do you feel it?

2108
03:08:35,480 --> 03:08:42,480
I think I'm getting sick of this shit.

2109
03:08:42,480 --> 03:08:45,480
I don't feel good.

2110
03:08:45,480 --> 03:08:48,480
I feel good.

2111
03:08:48,480 --> 03:08:52,480
I don't feel good.

2112
03:08:52,480 --> 03:08:55,480
I don't feel good.

2113
03:08:55,480 --> 03:08:58,480
I don't feel good.

2114
03:08:58,480 --> 03:09:02,480
I feel good.

2115
03:09:02,480 --> 03:09:04,480
Thanks for watching!
