243006	252454	2004, you're tuned in to the bee-money scene's most holiday-spirited station of all things rhythm and music, video gaming.

254610	255690	You might know me as Sky.
255770	258192	Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts.
258713	260414	In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm.
260434	262315	You know her better as DarkSakura.
262355	263596	Say hello to Jamie Summers.
263816	264477	So late.
265037	265557	I lied.
265638	267059	She's not here tonight, actually.
267399	270401	Actually, Jamie Summers is a little under the weather tonight.
270441	271242	She's a little sick.
272082	276505	She caught a Christmas bug, an elf bit her in the ass, and now she's sick.
276585	281489	I don't know what happened, but we hope you feel better soon, Miss DarkSakura.
282797	283938	The show must go on.
284818	287680	So joining me as always, say hello to our tech master, Loki.
289301	290062	I have the cheese.
292425	295247	See, you have food, so it's all right.
295427	308173	I was going to cook before the show, but due to our laying off of some extra staff members, we didn't have extra people.
308553	313876	Well, usually, now DarkSakura's the one that comes in here and she brings her big plate of meat and asparagus.
315277	317398	But tonight it's you that's snacking during the show.
317418	318538	You want to do some laundry, too?
319659	320859	Actually, I do need to do laundry.
320879	321500	There you go.
322608	324908	We'll get all the essence of DarkSakura.
324928	327089	We'll make it feel like she's here even though she's not.
327109	328609	I don't have a laptop.
328989	330109	Or homework, thank God.
332390	333050	See, there you go.
333070	334290	I was going to say we had a laptop.
334330	335410	Well, you could play DS.
335430	336270	That would be pretty close.
337891	338411	I'm just kidding.
338431	340511	It's actually not even similar at all.
340791	346272	Also joining us tonight, then, since DarkSakura isn't here, we do have a special guest.
346292	347892	Say hello to DarkChild.
348392	349813	Yo, what's up, what's up?
349973	351913	Life sucks, yo, but fuck it.
353796	355516	Merry Christmas to you too, my friend!
357617	358837	Bah hum fucking bug.
359117	359637	Alright.
361798	364478	Oh goody, we needed a little bit of anger tonight.
365438	366819	Since DarkSakura's not here.
366979	370579	And you know that since she's sick, she's extra angry.
371380	378261	So, you know, we've got all that extra anger right here in a little body we call Dark Child.
379884	383026	Anyway, it should be an interesting show tonight.
383107	384788	I really have no idea what's going to happen.
385869	391873	I notice our listenership is down a little bit, probably because you guys are away for the holidays, doing your holiday thing.
391933	392354	Fine!
392874	393715	See if we care.
394963	398667	You guys have your families and your presents and your eggnog.
398787	400649	Yeah, we don't do it for our listeners now.
400689	405394	We do it for our listeners on our reruns, which on Fridays on DDR Freak.
405614	405995	Catch it.
406936	408017	You're doing so good.
408037	410519	You're learning so well about the cheap plugs.
410599	411100	I love it.
413442	423529	See, that's what they all plan to do now, though, is that now that they know that this reruns on Friday, they're just like, nah, fuck it, I don't need to listen tonight, I can just tune in Friday over on TDR Freak.
424509	425570	Forget Orange Lounge.
428071	428552	That's alright.
429272	429592	Whatever.
430273	437878	Whatever gets us out there and gets us attention, whether it be on Orange Lounge Radio or TDR Freak Radio, who cares?
437998	440960	Because isn't attention whoring what it's really all about?
441932	442272	Oh, yeah.
442412	442612	Yeah.
443032	443352	Alright.
444793	445413	So, whatever.
446113	447493	We'll try and make do anyway.
447553	453854	I'm sure we have a lot of folks who want to talk about their Christmas and want to talk about New Year's coming up.
454375	456415	Want to talk about tsunamis in China.
456555	456975	I don't know.
457655	458355	Fuck all that.
458535	459156	Life sucks.
461256	464237	Or maybe we're just gonna... Let's just have a giant pity party.
464577	467337	Because isn't that what Orange Lounge is all about anyway?
467377	468878	Just feeling sorry for ourselves.
470298	470858	I have cheese.
473582	479744	Alright, we'll be back after this opening with How's Your Week, How's Your Day, and the Monty News and all that other fun stuff.
479764	482605	And this breaks the music from Guitar Freaks.
483485	484565	We'll be back after this.

727405	728286	DarkSakura.com
763400	764101	Hello?
764141	764301	Hello?
764621	765801	Is this thing on?
765821	766182	Testing?
766202	766702	Testing 1, 2...
792099	796021	I'm looking in the index, but I don't see anything for how to run a radio show.
796121	796622	Hello?
797282	798743	I don't understand this.
799423	800103	Does this thing work?
800123	801744	This thing reads like stereo instructions.
801804	802385	Is this on?
802405	803025	What the hell?
805566	806987	Orange Lounge Radio.
807167	809349	Broke down Ghetto Bomani Radio.
809369	811270	What the f***?
811290	813171	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
813231	815552	The lovely DarkSakura making an appearance in that promo.
815672	817353	Even though she's out tonight, she's feeling ill.
818233	819034	Yes, she is.
819094	820775	She's in that promo there with that other guy.
821840	825361	We are here on Orange Lounge Radio episode number 124.
825401	829482	I noticed our chat room is just kind of bouncing there, chatting away, talking.
829942	833402	So you can go join him at www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on chat.
833943	842164	And of course, Skype line, which we'll certainly probably have to make some use out of tonight because we have very limited talent here in the studio tonight.
842604	845265	Especially with Jamie being gone, well, there went all the talent, so...
846664	851787	We're really screwed now, so we'll probably be relying on you guys a little bit, but that's alright.
852187	854788	It's good when we get a chance to sit down and talk to our listeners a bit.
855548	857629	Hope all you guys out there had a happy holidays.
857710	858570	It is December 26th.
858690	860331	It's the day after Christmas.
861141	869467	So today is the day that everybody's out at the stores and they're spending their gift certificates and, you know, trying to, you know, spend all their Christmas money and things like that, trying to buy things.
869507	874570	So I hope for those of you that decided to go shopping today, you were able to find those things that you wanted.
875471	880614	I know that we had our own experience over at our local Best Buy, but there's kind of a backstory to this.
880674	890361	You see, basically what happened this week is that, you know, I was playing a little bit of computer games and stuff and I was leaning back in my chair and my fat ass broke my own chair.
891041	893602	So here I was without a chair on Christmas Eve.
894362	899323	Nowhere to go after 6 o'clock on Christmas Eve, so I couldn't replace the chair on Christmas Eve, so I couldn't replace it on Christmas Day.
900064	902144	So my back is starting to hurt after a while.
902184	904385	I could still sit in my chair, but I couldn't lean back.
904465	906485	Like, if I would lean back, I'd fall on the floor.
907006	910747	So I had to wait until today to go out and get a new chair, so I decided to brave Best Buy today.
911327	915508	And Loki said, hey, you know, I'll go too, because, what is it, you got for Christmas, what, like...
915988	917188	I have too many gift cards.
917248	919569	I cannot close my wallet because of all the gift cards.
919589	922630	So I was trying to get rid of the gift cards at Best Buy.
922690	924150	How much money did you have for Best Buy?
924170	924150	$50.
924490	929212	For those who don't know what Best Buy is, I think Best Buy is a nationwide thing, right?
929352	932372	If you don't have one in your neck of the woods, it's basically a huge electronics store.
932753	934493	DVDs, movies, CDs, all that stuff.
935242	938947	Which we really shouldn't name these things by name because they're not paying us advertising dollars.
939148	942392	It's like Circuit City, but blue.
943314	944435	Okay, fair enough.
945256	946678	We're not really endorsing them either.
946718	950784	We're just saying we went there because we had gift certificates and I needed a chair and I knew they sold chairs.
951445	956908	So anyway, went over to Best Buy, and holy crap was the line long at Best Buy.
956928	960550	I mean, it was going, it looked like it was the day before Christmas.
960630	962091	That's how they do the lines now.
962351	963212	It was crazy.
963252	964773	But I mean, it was a long, long line.
964813	968535	It was like, practically, it started to go, it was going back, and it was going like around the corner.
968695	971717	No, they set up a queue now, just like Fry's has.
971997	972177	Right.
972457	973798	Now, I know they don't have Fry's everywhere.
973818	976260	They have it all mostly on the West Coast, but I don't think they have it everywhere.
976280	976720	I don't think so, yeah.
977400	977600	So...
978761	980082	Basically, lines on Best Buy.
980102	981923	So I know a lot of people are out there shopping today.
982764	984985	My fat ass broke that chair, but that's okay.
985005	986486	It was kind of a shitty chair anyway.
986506	988087	It was a $20 Walmart chair.
988127	990229	That's what I get for shopping at Walmart, basically.
990269	991450	So I had to step it up anyway.
991490	992650	I needed to buy a nicer chair.
993211	999115	And I feel, might I say, I feel quite proud of myself because I built this chair.
999495	1000116	That's right.
1000476	1002657	This chair did not come pre-assembled.
1003298	1006200	So I had to get out the instruction manual, which I'll tell you.
1007091	1011714	Not written in this country, because they have to draw pictures to make sense of everything.
1011994	1016957	He first thought the instruction manual was not included until I later found it attached to a chair.
1017017	1017337	Shut up.
1018577	1019938	You don't have to bring that shit up, alright?
1020599	1028123	So finally, we discovered the instruction manual, which was poorly placed inside of the box somewhere.
1029503	1030544	And I put it together.
1030744	1032265	I put this whole chair together.
1032305	1033165	I was very happy.
1033306	1035447	Oh, Loki helped with one part, but, you know, that doesn't matter.
1036403	1038984	So, I'm very proud of my handiwork.
1039785	1040986	I feel like a man today.
1041346	1042586	I've become a man today.
1042647	1043747	I've built my own chair.
1044648	1045568	It was kind of like, you know what?
1045828	1047429	It was like Legos.
1047449	1049390	I think that's why we play with Legos as a kid.
1049430	1051912	Because, you know, I have to follow the Legos as a kid.
1053913	1055254	or now for some of you guys.
1056295	1060759	When you're building Legos, they don't tell you how to do it.
1060779	1062200	You have to follow the little pictures.
1062921	1063521	That's what it's doing.
1063541	1066704	It's prepping you for what the real world is going to be like when you have to build these chairs.
1067124	1073069	If you're ever going to shop at Ikea, basically, you better know how to put Legos together because that's the kind of instructions you're going to have to follow.
1073410	1076032	I'm very proud of myself for building this chair.
1076272	1079735	Only one screw is a little loose, so hopefully I'll be okay.
1081036	1082317	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1105455	1106356	Basically, here it is.
1106676	1109539	It's just me, it's just Loki, it's just Dark Child.
1109679	1112222	We're all ugly, so we don't need to be on the webcam.
1112262	1117848	Well, I could turn on the webcam, but you'd just have a picture of an empty couch.
1118288	1123493	Basically, if we were to turn on the webcam, all you would see is the gigantic box that my chair came in.
1123774	1127718	Which, I don't know how the chair comes in a ginormous box like that and isn't pre-assembled.
1128198	1138196	and then you see all the wrapping paper and just stuff strewn all about this post-Christmas chaos we have going on but there's nobody sitting over there with a webcam you guys bitch all the time
1138595	1140477	The webcam angle is horrid.
1141237	1142919	So maybe we'll move the webcam later.
1142939	1145020	We'll try to point it over here.
1145040	1146402	See, it's too big of a pain in the ass.
1146702	1152547	Because of this cabinet that Loki has, the cabinet of death thing that he's got going on, it's too hard to change.
1152567	1154649	I have to unlock the little coin door.
1154669	1156850	I have to go in, I have to turn on the power.
1156870	1158071	Then I have to switch over the...
1159833	1162494	Video input to make sure it's a TV, otherwise you get no video.
1162554	1165256	Then once I do that, then I have to start up the PlayStation 2.
1165316	1167057	I have to switch over the video to that.
1167077	1168978	Then I have to start iToyPlay.
1169298	1173040	Once I get iToyPlay going, then I have to set the iToy in a well-lit area.
1173320	1175061	So that means I have to adjust the lighting as well.
1175121	1175462	Thank you.
1175942	1177083	It's just too much damn work.
1177443	1180665	And consider we have half the listeners we usually have.
1181565	1181845	F you.
1181925	1183365	We're not going to set up the webcam.
1183385	1183826	No, I'm kidding.
1184106	1188086	We love you guys who are here tonight on your vacation listening.
1188186	1188466	Love you.
1188607	1190927	Just stare hard enough at the webpage.
1191027	1192067	You'll eventually see us.
1192147	1192747	Trust me.
1193348	1193808	You know what?
1193828	1193968	Here.
1194208	1198149	This is an excellent opportunity for you to visit our picture galleries.
1198589	1201789	And you can see... See, this is how you promote.
1201809	1203610	You cross-promote your other productions.
1203850	1204150	Loki.
1204590	1204870	This is...
1205450	1210813	You visit our picture gallery on the website, and you can see pictures of us at E3, smiling back at you.
1211093	1217216	And you can see Rice Princess is in there, and Lanky Style, Seagird's in there, Akira Yamaoka is in some of the pictures.
1217856	1222019	So, you know what, if you're missing the webcam tonight, check out our ugly mugs in the picture gallery.
1222059	1227181	And yes, for some reason, every single goddamn picture that is taken of me, I squint, and I don't know why.
1227581	1228682	It's just, I squint.
1228762	1230343	My eyes are sensitive or something.
1234392	1238154	Now Misty's offering financial compensation now for you to go through.
1238814	1243836	I still don't understand why they want a webcam pointed at nothingness, but maybe we could just turn on the TV.
1243876	1245036	We could just put it on Cartoon Network.
1245056	1246197	I'll turn on the webcam.
1246257	1247878	There you go.
1247938	1248018	God!
1248418	1251159	We could just point, you know, we could just turn the TV on Cartoon Network.
1251179	1253060	Or just go sit at the chair.
1253080	1253400	There you go.
1253520	1255481	Dark Child, you could just... Take a watch and be sick.
1256221	1256701	There you go.
1256741	1257822	You'll just, you can model.
1261778	1264740	At least they're not requesting nude modeling tonight, be thankful for that.
1264760	1266121	Ah, fuck it, I'd do it.
1267742	1269183	You're just in one of those moods.
1270704	1271505	It's that time of the month.
1271645	1272325	Oh, ho, ho.
1272805	1279010	Alright, well, we need to get into a little bit of how was your week, how was your day, where we're going to talk about how our week was and how our day was.
1279370	1282132	And I know that there was Halloween going on.
1282152	1283593	Or, Halloween.
1288196	1289497	It's going to be one of those shows.
1291827	1292507	You know what, though?
1292607	1296449	If your house is like my house at all, maybe it felt like Halloween to you.
1297449	1299290	Because things were a little bit scary.
1299310	1302692	Yes, you did get death for Christmas from... Who got that?
1302792	1304132	That was DarkSakura that got that for you.
1304152	1305493	The death doll, right?
1305573	1308614	So maybe it was Halloween for some... It feels like Halloween to me.
1310667	1311648	Trick or treat.
1312828	1313548	Give me money.
1315149	1315489	Alright.
1316309	1318110	Dark Child, we'll start with you, my friend.
1318910	1322972	Since Jamie usually starts us off and she's not here tonight and you're sort of filling in.
1323032	1323492	How was your week?
1323532	1323992	How was your day?
1324492	1325793	Where to start?
1326573	1327934	My week was the worst week.
1327954	1329414	Remember, it's a three hour show.
1329434	1330215	Yes, yes, I know, I know.
1330835	1332996	My week was the worst week ever.
1333356	1333816	I have
1334707	1337608	Move back home to my mother's house north of Sacramento.
1337828	1344050	I was hoping to continue changing things for me and Anita to be together, make things better.
1344130	1349031	You know, guys fuck up and we need to change a lot and it usually takes us a long time to figure it out.
1349791	1353132	Well, I give back and she no longer wants to be with me.
1354053	1355153	So, yeah, week sucked.
1355963	1363027	I spent the rest of the week staying at my mom's house on the ranch doing nothing but writing in a little book and sitting in the trailer since I'm not welcomed in the house.
1363047	1364548	So you get to ride horsies on the ranch?
1364568	1365929	No, I'm not allowed to ride the horses.
1366209	1366689	No horsies?
1366909	1367430	No horsies.
1368650	1370652	The dogs at the house get better privileges than I do.
1371872	1377976	So, yeah, and then Christmas came and my brother comes up with his fiancee, which made life more difficult for me.
1378776	1379817	And we had the usual
1381613	1385256	Family Argument, which ended up being resolved by us going outside and smoking some by.
1386377	1388039	Orange Arms did not support spoken by.
1390020	1390461	Today.
1390481	1392042	Today.
1393564	1395165	And, you know, I had dinner with my family.
1395185	1395806	You know what, though?
1395866	1398328	Now that I think about it, it would make this show a lot better.
1399509	1399909	I'm kidding.
1399949	1400310	I'm kidding.
1400770	1402272	Kids, say no to drugs.
1402392	1403533	Until you're 21.
1405607	1408769	So yeah, that was my week and my day today.
1409049	1416593	I hung out with Dream Pixie and her boyfriend and just talked about stuff.
1416714	1417994	The Orange Lounge, madam.
1418735	1419675	Where the fuck is she?
1419755	1420876	She was supposed to be here tonight.
1422217	1425639	She decided that she wanted to go to Hayward with her man, so... FIRED!
1426839	1427940	She'll be back Tuesday, though.
1429231	1434494	Oh, well, great, she can go guest on Jamie's show, because, you know, we don't do a show here on Tuesdays.
1435014	1435654	Alright, whatever.
1436174	1436935	I see how it is.
1438195	1438876	I see how it is.
1440136	1443038	Deep dickings are more important than Orange Lounge, I understand.
1443878	1444978	I'm not getting deep dicking here?
1446499	1447480	Maybe later, if you're good.
1447860	1448200	Okay.
1449200	1450841	But, yeah, that was my week and my day.
1450861	1452502	Alright, well.
1453652	1456714	Sorry to hear that the holidays were not that exciting, but you know what?
1457154	1463418	Sometimes that's what the holidays are for, is for us to just... I really don't know where I'm going with this thought.
1463858	1467381	Feel like shit because you realize that a big fat man in a red coat's not real?
1468862	1471563	Don't tell... We have children that listen to this show.
1472004	1475126	Santa is fake, so is the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy.
1477627	1481049	You're just breaking little kids' dreams everywhere.
1481610	1481810	Sad.
1482324	1485825	Although part of me is tempted to go to Golfland and announce that over the loudspeaker.
1486506	1490687	Attention children, get off my DDR machine.
1491607	1493008	Santa Claus does not exist.
1493208	1497210	Okay, now I see Loki with his thinking face over there and I know what he's thinking.
1497270	1497670	Let me think.
1499871	1506353	How could I patch in to the Roosevelt Golfland sound speaker system to make all the announcements I want?
1507264	1508184	No, that's not what I'm thinking.
1508204	1521926	What I'm thinking is, with the portable PC they'll have, which we'll be able to, you know, record to for E3 and stuff, you could put, like, some external speakers running off the same battery power and turn those up really loud, and it'd be like your own portable boombox system.
1523587	1525867	That's so... Remember the early 90s?
1525927	1536509	Remember those old rap videos, you know, where they would carry the boombox on their shoulder, like, you know, with the loud music playing, and it was in all the rap videos and the colorful getup they'd have?
1537896	1545301	You're almost describing that exact same thing, except now it's like gone totally nerddom, where now you'll have the big PC sitting on your shoulder.
1546602	1550144	Attention, Golf Land children, there is no Santa Claus.
1550584	1551585	Enjoy your day.
1553906	1555927	Your parents have been lying to you for years.
1557769	1565954	The only reason your parents brought you here is so that they don't have to listen to you for an hour, so they can get some peace and quiet, and possibly do it in the bathroom.
1568854	1570175	Have a happy holiday!
1570516	1572197	Ho, ho, ho!
1574739	1576481	Loki, how was your week and your day?
1578062	1579464	He's sending the webcam.
1580224	1581205	Take a break from the webcam.
1581265	1583587	No, I have to fix webcam.
1587151	1589453	Anyways, my week and day...
1591021	1592442	My week was boring.
1593082	1594903	It was really busy and then it got really dead.
1595143	1597764	And then we went and saw the Phantom of the Opera.
1597804	1598485	That was okay.
1599165	1606728	And I got lots of shirts and gift cards and played lots of Final Fantasy.
1607769	1608469	Made fried rice.
1609130	1609650	That's about it.
1609670	1611731	That fried rice was good, by the way.
1611751	1612611	It was very good.
1613111	1613592	Delicious.
1614741	1616002	You should be an Iron Chef.
1616222	1625688	Between you and Jamie, I'm set when it comes to this show because I can't cook for shit, but Jamie cooks really well, and Loki cooks really well, and heaven.
1626889	1631472	I think that should be a requirement to continue being a co-host of the show, is that you should cook for me every week.
1633234	1636056	And in return, I will bring you my presents.
1636556	1638077	I brought you Puerto Rican sausage.
1640398	1641139	I'm vegetarian.
1642800	1643981	It's okay, you don't have to swallow.
1647234	1648788	Alright anyway, my week and my day.
1650546	1652766	My week was pretty unexciting.
1652826	1654567	I mean, work, and we got off work early.
1654687	1657227	Did karaoke on Thursday, which was exciting.
1657567	1663048	Got to stay long enough to see some strippers, which were really ugly, so we decided to leave.
1663228	1663488	Woo!
1663528	1664608	Go strippers ugly!
1664648	1666449	Yeah, they were really ugly, so we left early.
1667189	1668249	Christmas was okay.
1668649	1669969	I got money, which is a good thing.
1670009	1670770	Money's always good.
1670830	1673530	And I got a really ugly sweater, which, you know, I'm always thankful for that.
1676290	1677491	Let's see, what else happened?
1677571	1678911	Oh, I went and saw Phantom of the Opera.
1679975	1682116	Also at the movie theater because it was playing.
1682477	1686740	It's tradition in our family that we always go and see a movie on Christmas.
1686780	1691122	It's like, okay, we eat, then we open all the presents, then we go and we go to a movie.
1691243	1693644	So we went and saw Phantom of the Opera because that's what my mom wanted to see.
1694004	1694725	And it was a good movie.
1695185	1698327	I cried like a little girl and it was a very gay film.
1698407	1700128	So I was quite pleased with it.
1700589	1700929	It was good.
1702376	1702997	I recommend it.
1703137	1704979	Thumbs up if you want to go see Phantom of the Opera.
1704999	1707141	Although it was a little long.
1707161	1707902	It was kind of long.
1707942	1710325	But I've seen the stage play a couple times.
1710685	1712347	And there were some things about the stage play.
1712367	1714168	I don't know if it translated very well to screen.
1714529	1716571	But overall it was well acted and all that fun stuff.
1716931	1718413	Oh, you changed the angle of the cam.
1718473	1718773	I see.
1719054	1719174	Oh.
1720287	1720947	Well, great.
1721107	1723148	Wow, you guys really owe Loki for this one.
1723188	1728311	He went up there and changed the angle of the cam completely so that you can see us in our little corner.
1728591	1730452	And you can see what a dump my workstation is.
1730592	1731312	Oh, well, that's alright.
1731413	1731833	I don't care.
1733554	1734294	I build a chair.
1735435	1736815	Everything else can go to hell.
1738196	1739737	Alright, so that was pretty much my week and my day.
1741658	1743138	Yeah.
1743298	1744879	Anything else exciting happen on your Christmas?
1745359	1745780	That was it?
1746160	1748301	You seemed like you were gone a lot this week.
1749434	1752096	Well, no, I was only gone like a few days.
1752296	1756560	Like, Christmas Eve, hung out at my parents' house.
1757420	1762164	Christmas Day, when I hung out at my parents' house because my grandparents were over.
1764406	1766167	That's pretty much all I did, really.
1766427	1769870	Oh, I have 100 stars now in Mario 64.
1770450	1774974	That's a lot of downtime waiting for parties in Final Fantasy.
1776162	1776842	Now, here we go.
1776902	1779743	There's an idea for what we could do with the show tonight, because Jamie's not here.
1779763	1781503	We could just have Final Fantasy XI chat tonight.
1783284	1785124	I don't play Final Fantasy XI anymore.
1785164	1785764	You used to.
1785784	1787824	I don't play any games anymore.
1788445	1790105	Weren't you playing World of Warcraft for a while there?
1790145	1792585	Yeah, I was in the beta for like seven months.
1792605	1795986	Everybody's freaking ditching Final Fantasy XI to go World of Warcraft, but you know what?
1796126	1796366	Don't.
1796526	1797306	They're coming back.
1797546	1797826	Oh, yeah.
1798287	1800287	Oh, you didn't enjoy World of Warcraft?
1800859	1818617	I did, but it had problems, and when it came to release time, they still hadn't even worked out putting in talents for some of the classes, and other classes were just still too overly powerful, and other classes didn't do what they were supposed to do, and then somehow it went gold, so it's going to be like Star Wars Galaxy all over again, one year of paid beta.
1822581	1824783	Alright, fair enough, and welcome to your opinion.
1826226	1827547	So yeah, Final Fantasy XI chat.
1827567	1827907	No, I'm kidding.
1828127	1830428	Actually, but you were saying something which I thought was kind of funny.
1830468	1832910	You said something in chat before the show which I thought was really interesting.
1832950	1840754	You were typing and you said, I keep wanting to type slash L before I type anything, but only my link shell will hear it.
1841155	1845077	Now that's the sign of too much Final Fantasy XI.
1845677	1846538	And not a chat room.
1848239	1848539	Alright.
1849824	1851244	Alright, we're going to go to a break, you guys.
1851264	1853525	When we come back from break, maybe we'll get to some Bomani news.
1853565	1855225	Maybe we'll take some calls on the Skype line.
1855245	1857746	I want to hear about your guys' Christmas and how things are going.
1857806	1860466	So, go ahead and give us a call over there when we come back.
1860506	1867227	If you don't know what I'm talking about when I say the Skype line, head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on Interact With Us.
1867247	1871108	We're going to be back after this break of music from 2DX 10th Style.
1871548	1872808	We're kind of in a year-end show.
1872828	1875949	This is going to be the last show of the year, if you can believe it, because the next show will be on...
1881892	1883533	Sorry about that little bit of dead air there, guys.
1883713	1884233	Sorry about that.
1884493	1887695	Loki made a klutzy move and he unplugged our soundboard completely.
1889996	1890937	Do not be alarmed.
1890977	1891477	Do not be alarmed.
1892117	1897260	Anyway, yeah, we're getting towards the year-end show here, so we kind of want to start acknowledging those games that came out this year.
1897560	1899681	We played a lot of songs during the pre-show.
1900021	1902722	We've got some more songs for you, kind of the best of 2004 here.
1903063	1906504	All right, we'll be back after this break featuring some music from 2DX10Style.
1906644	1908945	We'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio after this.
2006372	2007113	Thanks for watching!
2142639	2143561	Thank you for watching!
2154709	2155550	And what I need
2185525	2186666	Thank you for watching!
2186846	2188568	Please subscribe to my channel!
2218015	2223760	I can't believe it's me, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
2262641	2271987	And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.
2272729	2276833	Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bomani Music and More program.
2276853	2277814	Can we talk about that?
2278094	2280436	No subject will ever be taboo.
2280737	2284360	Well, I was thinking maybe we should move Pump Up the Volume from Tuesday Nights.
2284900	2287443	Except, of course, a subject that was just under discussion.
2287943	2293288	Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?
2293849	2295130	I collect your fucking head.
2297082	2298583	Just like this fucker here.
2299664	2303347	Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki?
2303648	2307010	The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!
2307951	2314417	Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!
2315618	2319321	Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.
2322250	2326011	Does anyone even know what the holic thing on episode 69 is anymore?
2326091	2327712	I mean, that was like a year ago.
2328392	2329193	More than a year ago.
2329513	2332434	It was about a year and a few months ago.
2333094	2335495	I know some of our obsessive folks in the chat room know.
2335515	2337015	The folks that have been listening for forever.
2337075	2341157	But those of you that haven't been listening very long probably have no idea what they're talking about there.
2341889	2342309	That's right.
2342929	2345970	Ask Misty or Angel or one of those folks that would know about it.
2346030	2347270	Ask one of them to explain it to you.
2347290	2348370	They'll be kind enough to do so.
2349011	2349291	Alright.
2350971	2352251	Anyway, we are here on Orange Lawn Radio.
2352851	2356392	We do have an interesting circumstance tonight because DarkSakura is not here.
2357132	2361473	So usually we try to do something a little silly for the cage match when DarkSakura isn't here.
2361533	2365454	Like we do a reverse cage match, we do the karaoke cage match or something crazy.
2365954	2368195	Loki's giving me that look of no karaoke cage match.
2368535	2369115	That's fine.
2369795	2370636	Are you saying that I can't sing?
2390936	2396819	Well, okay, I guess Dark Child possibly could sing, but I'm not singing again, and neither is Loki.
2397639	2399480	Yeah, I can tell by the expression on his face.
2400001	2402062	So we have to do something a little different with Cage Match Night.
2402082	2402582	So here it is.
2403802	2406984	And you guys have been begging for this forever.
2407464	2410726	So consider this your freaking Christmas present, alright?
2412607	2416409	Well, we will allow a chat room choice, okay?
2417418	2426953	So if you have an idea what song you would like to put in tonight's cage match, send me a private message right now with the song you would like to put in tonight's cage match.
2428157	2435722	And we will pick one at random Now you gotta be prepared, you might have to send me the song So don't name anything you don't have, because you might have to send it to me, okay?
2436083	2454856	So think about a song, think about it, don't just send the first thing that comes to your mind Think about a song you would like to hear in tonight's cage match Send it to me over private message, Sky in the chatroom And we will have a chatroom choice in tonight's cage match And then, maybe you guys will stop complaining that our choices suck Because one of them will be yours So, there you have it
2455640	2459301	Does that sound like a fair thing we can do for our listeners?
2459341	2459722	I think so.
2459942	2460402	Sounds fair.
2460742	2460982	I think.
2461462	2462042	Sounds very fair.
2463083	2464083	Well, you're song one.
2464223	2471346	I will pick a new song, and then we will have, instead of DarkSakura, because she's out tonight, we will have the chatroom choice as the third song.
2471466	2473026	So there you have it.
2473067	2474587	Because Dark Child doesn't matter.
2475527	2477188	Well, you matter.
2477448	2479869	Now, see, you still get to trash all three songs.
2479929	2480449	Oh, true, true.
2480489	2481210	So there you go.
2483010	2483971	So don't worry, Dark Child.
2483991	2484991	There's still a lot of love for you.
2486940	2490765	Darkchild, for those that may not know you, you haven't been on the show in a little while.
2492167	2496432	We're syndicated over on DDR Freak now, which has exposed ourselves to a whole new listener base.
2496993	2498475	Some folks may not know who you are.
2499596	2502440	Tell us a little bit about yourself and your DDR history.
2502700	2503461	I know you go...
2504062	2506766	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2520464	2521484	Yeah, Male Penis Golf Land.
2522124	2525905	And he's like, hey, dude, there's this cool new game that we're testing out here.
2525925	2527526	Because, you know, Male Penis gets a lot of test stuff.
2528066	2529906	So he has me go to the Golf Land.
2529926	2530726	I see DDR.
2531326	2532247	And my friend Ron gets on.
2532267	2534347	I'm like, whoa, that game looks like it's tight.
2534727	2535547	So I try to play it.
2535987	2536527	I suck.
2536988	2541529	You know, I was barely able to get past Boom Boom Dollar because, you know, everyone passes heavy, never been mellow.
2542589	2542829	This was 1.5.
2544813	2550035	Then it turns out that the guy that's standing there playing with us is a guy named Jim from Konami.
2550115	2554616	He was in charge of testing it for Konami, so I played with, you know, the original test market here in the U.S.
2554896	2555576	Wow, okay.
2556036	2563819	And I got started playing right around the same time as Jason Ko, Mel B, Jahi, you know, all them old scores.
2563839	2566020	Love the name dropping, love the name dropping.
2566040	2567300	Yeah, I gotta drop it for him.
2568257	2571259	and Mike Noe, RTF.
2571820	2573841	I was also there for the DDR Freak listeners.
2574001	2579105	I was there when Jason Coe and us came up with the idea for DDRFreak.com.
2579405	2581026	I've been there from the beginning.
2581867	2585630	Only SoCal people who played imported DDR could say they've been playing longer than me.
2586341	2589064	Ooh, oh, whipping out the DDR penis!
2589184	2589544	Oh, hell yeah.
2589564	2591846	Showing everyone right now how big it is.
2591966	2592466	Alright.
2593547	2595669	So how many years does that make that you've been playing DDR?
2595689	2596229	When was this?
2596289	2596790	Is this 98?
2597070	2597310	That was 98.
2597751	2598411	Shit.
2598771	2600813	And I haven't really been playing much anymore.
2600833	2602575	I've been a big-time judge the past few years.
2603415	2608459	And I have a big tournament event coming up in September called the Max Games Tournament.
2608620	2609240	Tell us about it.
2609340	2610461	It's in September.
2610781	2611362	In September.
2611382	2612443	Dang, two ways off.
2612483	2614825	This is going to be held at the San Jose Tech Museum.
2615729	2616910	Sorry, I'm holding it too close.
2617070	2619090	Alright, San Jose Tech Museum.
2620171	2624392	And DDR will not be the only game there, but I will be running the tournament for DDR.
2624413	2627334	It will be Perfect Attack and Freestyle, a weekend-long event.
2627854	2632196	There will also be a Halo 2 tournament, a bunch of other game tournaments on consoles.
2632996	2640579	Red vs. Blue is going to show up, and we're going to be airing Season 3 and possibly all of the seasons on the IMAX screen located at the Tech Museum.
2641500	2645724	as well as BrickFlick.com will be having a video that we're creating currently.
2646204	2649967	I'm a member of BrickFlick and we're going to be making a Lego video for the IMAX screen.
2651389	2653150	And it's going to be a huge event.
2653210	2655592	That's why we're planning ahead now for September.
2655933	2658695	And also at the same time, Tech Museum will have a video game exhibit.
2659536	2659696	Oh.
2660056	2663819	So a huge history of video game thing going on at the museum the same weekend.
2663960	2664640	We want to go.
2665121	2666662	Hook us up with some media thing.
2666682	2666882	Of course.
2666942	2668283	I'll have a couple of VIP passes.
2668343	2668804	Woo-hoo.
2669383	2670864	Get three, because there are three hosts here.
2670904	2672205	All right.
2672765	2678750	I want to clarify some things, because some folks in our chat room have some questions about the chat room choice for Cage Match tonight.
2679270	2683453	You know, and you guys have been begging to do this for forever, so I thought you already knew how it worked, but that's fine.
2683473	2683953	That's fine.
2685074	2687135	I realize it's been a while, so I'll just remind you guys.
2687595	2691616	The way the cage match works is that we put three songs into rotation.
2692277	2703641	Originally, the concept was songs that aren't in a Bomani game that should be or sound like they belong in a Bomani game, but they're not there yet, so, you know, just upbeat, happy dance songs.
2704241	2708243	But it kind of transformed itself into whatever's cool right now.
2708323	2710343	We've had all sorts of cage match winners.
2710404	2714605	We've had Bomani artists win with like Echo Image won before.
2714645	2716126	We've had Top 40 artists win it.
2716146	2717226	Gwen Stefani won.
2717566	2720488	We've had songs from Overclocked in there.
2720528	2724049	We've had songs that were theme songs to animes and stuff in there.
2724689	2725490	All sorts of stuff.
2725990	2726190	So...
2727162	2729464	Just whatever sounds good to you that you think is going to win it.
2729564	2731906	I would love anyone who puts Slipknot in there.
2732747	2733328	Jesus.
2733348	2735430	Okay, we have to have some jurisdiction over this.
2735830	2736390	Alright, anyway.
2736731	2738673	Now that we've clarified that, back to you for a minute.
2739033	2742456	So, when did you... So you've been playing DDR since 98.
2743177	2743897	When did you stop?
2744758	2747240	I stopped playing right around...
2748341	2750363	I'd say just after Third Mix came out.
2750743	2751924	Which is about the time I started.
2752124	2754626	Yeah, it's about the time a lot of people started because that's when it was hitting the U.S.
2754666	2755066	market.
2755166	2755827	Right.
2756147	2758749	I moved up to Wheatland, which is north of Sacramento.
2758809	2759610	Which is a little...
2760789	2762689	Nothing whole in the world, yeah.
2763150	2767831	And, you know, coming from MGL, we still thought, you know, there was no Sakto DDR.
2768031	2770091	No, and there wasn't at the time, really.
2770111	2771751	So I didn't really play up here.
2771891	2777733	When I went down back to the Bay and I was trying 4th style and some of the hard songs on 3rd style, I was way out of my league again.
2778433	2784434	You know, I saw Orochi sitting there flying, his feet flying all over the board on songs I couldn't even picture the arrows on.
2785379	2790305	So that's when I kind of stopped playing and started getting invited to judge a bunch of tournaments.
2790325	2792427	So I've just been a judge since then.
2792747	2799976	Now, okay, since you're a judge and you've judged a lot of tournaments, this is a good question because we've got a lot of tournaments that have been going on lately coming up.
2800609	2802270	What kind of shit do you look for in a routine?
2802350	2804832	What makes a good freestyle DDR routine?
2805712	2809415	First off, I hate power moves after power move after power move.
2810095	2822063	If it looks like your routine doesn't flow and you know you could break, so you do breaking here, then there's a little pause and nothing, and then more breaking here, and then a pause and it's just regular dance, then more breaking, it's obvious you're just doing power moves to impress us.
2822964	2824325	And a lot of judges don't like that.
2825094	2834760	Another thing, if I've seen you up there before, it's really hard for people like Mel B to impress me, because I've seen a lot of his routines, and I always expect him to do something a little more.
2835541	2839123	You know, if I've seen you compete a lot of times, I'd like to see a different routine.
2839303	2841404	So you think you're giving noobs a break a little bit?
2841985	2844266	I think a little bit, because I haven't seen him in action.
2844546	2847588	Because I've judged one or two tournaments, not a lot.
2847668	2850830	I don't get asked to judge tournaments, because I guess I suck at DDR.
2852451	2852932	But I...
2854016	2859351	I don't always give newbies a break I mean, I still expect that you better not be looking at the screen
2860320	2861301	Oh, definitely, definitely.
2861581	2863343	You better look like you're having fun.
2863843	2864244	You know what?
2864664	2872411	Me, personally, that's the number one bitch I have about freestyle routines is that people look depressed while they dance.
2872752	2880599	And I'm not saying you have to smile like a cheerleader when you play, but at least your expression should match the mood you're trying to convey with what you're doing.
2880619	2882180	And I realize that sounds a little froofy.
2882301	2885844	I think the best guy who shows his mood the best way would probably be Bruce Leroy.
2886224	2888646	On his routine, he's just glowing the whole time.
2888726	2889966	One of the best, absolutely.
2890026	2892388	He always just carries it in his expressions.
2892408	2893128	Yeah, definitely.
2893148	2894609	You've got to look like you're having fun up there.
2894649	2898992	If you look like you're bored and just doing something memorized, then you're going to get knocked down a bit.
2899012	2900633	When you look bored, I hate that.
2900833	2903314	I hate that more than anything, and I've totally penalized.
2903875	2908698	Again, I haven't judged on many, but in the ones that I have, I totally would penalize people if they looked bored.
2909058	2910299	Because then I feel bored.
2911099	2912021	Anyway, I'm sorry to interrupt.
2912061	2912922	I went off on a tangent.
2912942	2915146	It's supposed to be about you, not me.
2915166	2919473	The last thing that I really look for in judging is make sure you actually have some kind of freestyle routine.
2919674	2922418	Don't go up there and do a perfect attack.
2922458	2924061	Just stepping and getting the arrows all right.
2924670	2953893	you know you got you got to do some kind of moves try a move or something now that used to be cool like way back in the day wasn't there somebody had done a paranoia rebirth routine and it was basically kind of just backwards memorized type thing it doesn't cut it anymore it was cool way back when it was cool back in the day when nobody could pass a 9 footer but let's face it everybody and their mothers passed max 300 by now actually that's so not true because I still I passed max 300 once but that's it I mean honestly
2954830	2961073	Considering we've been doing this show for how long now, you think that Loki, myself, and DarkSakura would all actually be good DDR players?
2962133	2967876	We're good, but we're not, you know, oh my god's triple A's on Legend of Max good.
2968016	2970017	Because unfortunately we're old as well.
2970057	2971737	We don't have the stamina you kids have.
2971757	2975759	I find it funny some of the songs that people could pass now that I don't stand a chance on.
2976294	2981595	Yet I could still go back to a 1-5 machine and play Paranoia 180, the original one on Maniac.
2982476	2984656	And some people still can't keep up with me on that song.
2985697	2988557	But they kick my butt on all sorts of other songs on other machines.
2988717	3001421	Because you take out the vivid and it's just... This is why DarkSakura, she sits here and she always says, Back in my day, we had second mix and we didn't have this vivid stuff.
3002041	3005042	Yeah, the different colored arrows, that's cheating, man.
3011187	3015931	I thought I was the shit the first time I played DDR because I passed a two-footer my first game.
3016772	3018713	But that was because I played a ton of Busta Groove.
3018813	3020454	And so I already, you know, I kind of had an idea.
3020815	3023597	I'd watched DDR, I'd kind of taken notes from a distance.
3024465	3027507	But I remember, I remember Alguana Girl and I played our very first game of DDR together.
3028167	3029728	And look where she's at and look where I'm at.
3029808	3032249	She's the co-admin of a huge DDR forum.
3032309	3034991	Me, I got a shitty little internet show with two of my friends.
3035411	3038453	Hey, I played with Jason Coe and helped him come up with DDR.com.
3038473	3039373	There you go.
3039453	3041955	And now you're a guest on this shitty internet show.
3044077	3045417	My, how far we've come.
3045777	3051378	I also remember playing back on 1.5, just trying to see what a Maniac song looked like once we found the code.
3051398	3052078	Did you say Maniac?
3052538	3053019	Yeah, I said Maniac.
3053039	3054279	She's a Maniac, come on.
3055319	3060680	But, you know, we figured out the Maniac code, and I remember four of us getting on the machine, trying to play one song on Maniac.
3060800	3063720	Each person added Arrow, and we still couldn't do it.
3063780	3072222	Wait a minute, I remember people doing that when Max 300 was new, and people wanted to get... No, it was Legend of Max... Goddammit.
3072562	3072782	Max...
3073522	3074323	What was the middle one?
3074383	3075163	What was the middle one?
3075563	3076724	Max Unlimited, thank you.
3077004	3079205	Because everybody was like, oh my god, Kakumei, right?
3079906	3085189	And so I remember watching this happen where everybody was on one arrow and they were doing this together.
3085229	3087330	It's just like on 2DX.
3088111	3092933	When people were trying to get the extra stage there, they would play doubles, but they'd have two people playing to make it easier.
3095375	3096916	Just to hear that song.
3097376	3100778	I've been judging ever since the way back when.
3101624	3106568	You know, you might catch me at Golf Land or something playing every now and then, but it's nothing spectacular.
3111012	3112253	So do you ever do PA at all?
3113234	3113414	No.
3113654	3115075	No, you never were a PA?
3115696	3116797	I'm a member of RTF.
3117417	3119159	Oh, I didn't realize you were a member.
3119199	3124363	Yeah, I became an honorary member of RTF and an honorary member of Step Squad.
3125364	3126805	And then, of course, old school MGL.
3131056	3131356	All right.
3133477	3141740	So what do you think... Since you're an old school member of all these clubs, what do you think of all these... It seems like everywhere I look, there's a DDR club, or a little DDR cult.
3142020	3146222	And I admit, I've been just as bad, because we had our own little DDR cult back in the day, Sacramento.
3146942	3147762	Everybody hated us.
3149423	3152804	I still don't know why we weren't... You were the new kids on the block.
3152884	3153244	That's why.
3153284	3153625	We were so white.
3153645	3154385	We were new.
3154525	3156586	You know, for the longest time... But we were sexy.
3157046	3159327	For the longest time, it was MGL against SoCal.
3159347	3159647	They had...
3160373	3162435	Hey, you gotta stop holding the bar.
3188479	3192280	No, no, I remember, you know, back when I played... There's a battle in your neck of the woods somewhere.
3192980	3197482	Yeah, I do the whole California thing because, you know, it was just in this end of the woods when I was playing.
3198062	3200423	But I remember when I started seeing other crews come up.
3200683	3203624	Like, I remember seeing one out of Ohio and one out of Iowa.
3203644	3205364	I was like, what the hell?
3206104	3207305	They got DDR up there now?
3207365	3209325	I thought they were all backwards in that country.
3209925	3212586	Well, especially when these places started getting DDR first.
3212666	3216427	That was kind of... Oh, yeah, that was really weird because, you know, I played at a test market.
3216447	3218168	It's like, you know, California is where it's at
3218902	3223124	and we're supposed to get everything first other than Japan and other people were getting it.
3224184	3229026	Comment from the chatroom in response to your bar raping comment, DarkSakura.
3229086	3232088	Misty in the chatroom says, I'd rather bar rape and pass the song.
3232108	3232568	Okay, thanks.
3233108	3234629	Could I have a martini while you're on the bar?
3237441	3237901	No, no.
3238641	3240362	That was a dumb joke.
3240382	3241883	That was a really, really dumb joke.
3241903	3242863	Congratulations.
3243083	3243764	Yeah, I know, I know.
3244404	3244744	I get it.
3244784	3248365	I honestly grab the bar on occasion when I do my Paranoia 180 freestyle.
3249606	3253928	I do this little criss-cross step thing and I can't stop myself from grabbing that bar to do it.
3254068	3255028	Otherwise, I'll fall down.
3257133	3261498	This is the quintessential DDR discussion is bar raping.
3261538	3264141	It seems like we've had this discussion on the show a thousand times.
3264602	3265963	But it's been a good month.
3266163	3269828	It's been a few good months since we've had this discussion, so I'm fine with having it again.
3271644	3276867	I'm okay if other people want to use the bar because I always say if they don't want you to use the bar, they would not have the bar.
3277868	3279389	People do take the bar off the machine.
3279409	3281271	Oh yeah, I love when we do tournaments with no bar.
3281291	3282051	It's kind of funny.
3283592	3293119	But, you know, me personally, because I learned to play without the bar, when I go back and try to use the bar, it messes me up even more.
3293179	3296561	And I've tried because I'm like, maybe I can pass Max Unlimited if I use the bar.
3297062	3297582	But I can't.
3297642	3298783	I'm still just too old.
3298803	3299764	My bones are too frail.
3300504	3301485	So I just can't do it.
3301565	3306049	The bar is basically there for me when I'm about to slip and fall on my ass, which does happen occasionally.
3306289	3308751	Honestly, though, there's something I hate more than bar raping.
3308971	3309511	Oh, what's that?
3309551	3311853	That's another Seattleer thing I saw.
3312454	3314496	Windex on the shoes and on the pants.
3315817	3317118	I don't get the windex.
3317718	3318219	Wow.
3318759	3321401	You're just going to make all sorts of friends here tonight, aren't you?
3321942	3322802	I'm not here to make friends.
3322842	3323583	I'm here to be honest.
3325565	3330729	I never got the Windex and stuff, and I don't know, I guess it works for Seattleers because they seem to get really far in PA.
3330749	3336793	Yeah, that's right, they kick their ass in PA, really, so maybe you ought to go to the store and buy a bottle of Windex.
3337213	3341096	See, that's when I slip and fall on my ass, is when the pads are too damn slick.
3342557	3344778	See, this is the reason why I'm not allowed to judge PA.
3345099	3346980	I mean, it has nothing to do with the fact that it's all point-based.
3347000	3349822	There is no, yeah, I'm like, there is no... There's nothing to do with that, you know.
3350302	3350883	I can't judge.
3350943	3351983	They won't let me judge PA.
3352023	3355506	I've asked and asked and asked because I will ream people for stupid ass shit.
3356367	3362512	Even though they get perfect all the way through a full combo, I'll be like, You'll grab the bar through half the song?
3363613	3364213	Please step out.
3366134	3367215	Please do no rape the bar.
3369617	3371178	I get a kick out of Seattle people.
3371299	3371959	I love them all.
3372059	3373600	You know, you play DDR, you're cool with me.
3374841	3375202	Fair enough.
3375502	3375642	Just...
3376195	3376996	Just play the game.
3377156	3378276	Just play the damn game.
3378537	3379537	Enough of the drama drama.
3379557	3380678	Just play the damn game.
3380758	3381799	Yeah, yeah.
3381819	3385061	Because honestly, some of us have issues even being able to play the game recently.
3385361	3390664	You know, I sat here for like an hour today going, maybe I should get out of the DDR pad and play.
3391045	3393506	Because I ate a lot over this holiday season.
3393806	3394187	A lot.
3395007	3396788	And I could stand to play some DDR.
3397549	3403613	I could stand to play about 48 hours straight worth of DDR to work off all the crap I ate over the holiday weekend.
3403653	3405714	But it's just not going to happen because I'm lazy.
3406161	3408002	Man, I'm ready to get back into my own routine.
3408042	3412345	I was at Scandia today staring at the machine like, hey, I could play that again.
3413366	3417728	You know, I used to play, you know, every night I was at MGL because I never paid for tokens.
3418009	3430577	I drove by Roseville Golf Land twice over this past little few days here over Christmas, and both times I actually contemplated stopping in, which is more than I could say for six months ago.
3431647	3433108	I hear it's gotten a lot better now.
3433168	3434789	Scania's a lot different now, too.
3434829	3435490	I think DDR's dead.
3435510	3436110	I don't think DDR's dead.
3452930	3453471	Thanks for watching!
3467608	3468629	Very true, very true.
3468749	3473035	Oh, Loki says there's a new arcade release coming out and we'll talk about that during the next break.
3473055	3473816	What a good segue.
3474437	3475618	Okay, we're going to go to a break.
3475638	3476279	We're going to come back.
3476639	3484709	We're going to have our cage match with our special guest entry courtesy of our winner from the random pick, BRP Ohio Bomani.
3485655	3487796	is going to have the chat room.
3487876	3489437	Big Red Pimp, that's right, that's what he goes by.
3489497	3490077	Big Red Pimp.
3491398	3492699	Sounds like a red mage in Final Fantasy.
3495320	3496901	He's going to have our chat room choice tonight.
3497261	3501403	Loki, by the way, if you're wondering why you haven't heard from Loki all this break, he's cooking right now.
3501483	3503044	What exactly are you cooking over there, Loki?
3503904	3504505	Fried rice!
3505225	3506926	He's making his fried rice.
3507166	3508787	So we'll be able to have some of that here on the show.
3509178	3511901	Alright, we'll be back after this break.
3512001	3516347	We're going to get some music from 2DX Red, another big game in 2004, a little later this year.
3517328	3518690	And we'll be back after this.
3518710	3523515	We're going to start it off with a little bit of Double A, something I know you guys go for in DDR sometimes.
3528161	3528582	We'll be back.
3584935	3585536	Thanks for watching!
3654931	3655432	and many more.
3690037	3690537	Thanks for watching!
3724282	3724622	and many more.
3900600	3901561	Gaming Radio.
3901801	3909107	So uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.
3909247	3910668	Orange Lounge Radio.
3914391	3916633	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
3918414	3918874	Episode number 124.
3921658	3925645	And I have no idea what that means, what the significance of 124 is.
3926246	3932938	But next week would be 125, that's kind of a, that's like, you know, a dollar and a quarter, that's pretty big.
3935031	3961023	So anyway, we're here, we've got myself, Loki, if you're just joining us, DarkSakura's out tonight, she's a little sick, apparently she's been sleeping a lot, had a resurgence of some virus, that's gotta suck to get sick on Christmas though, but I've been there, it sucks, it's no fun, and DarkChild is here tonight, filling in, which is good, we haven't heard from DarkChild in a while, and he's old school, we were talking a little bit in that last segment there, just about some old school, we're living some old school memories.
3961894	3967376	So looking forward to the future, because this is the last show of the year, what do you think Bomani has in store for 2005?
3967536	3974318	You think we're all going to move on, get a life, go to a new game, or what do you think the Bomani scene has in store for 2005?
3974458	3977980	I see some more DDR coming out.
3978460	3983482	I'd like to see some more come out from Japan with some Japanese songs on it instead of this U.S.
3983582	3986343	marketed bullcrap with Britney Spears to dance to.
3987363	3990184	Now wait a minute, Britney Spears has not been in a DDR mix yet.
3991007	3991427	Not yet.
3991467	3993809	She has her own series of music games, remember?
3994369	3994849	Yes, yes.
3995850	4001173	But you know, I'm betting though, with more DDR coming out in the U.S., there'll be a lot more U.S.
4001273	4001993	artists in there.
4002654	4006696	Stuff that would attract a larger audience than just the Bambani people.
4006756	4012419	You know, someone comes out to the arcade, hears a song they know on the radio, and they see it's on a game, they're probably more likely to dance on it.
4014461	4018543	I'm hoping 2DX keeps going, because that's the game I play now, instead of DDR.
4019765	4029551	If that game is tight, I've seen some songs from 2DX Red where apparently they're some of the hardest songs ever released before and I've seen the videos of two guys on doubles not passing it.
4029571	4032252	There's some pretty crazy shit in 2DX Red.
4033533	4034614	That's all I know so far.
4035714	4037916	Yeah, Garrett was kind enough to show me videos.
4038736	4040777	It's insane.
4040797	4045360	That's all I really see for the Bomani scene is just more DDR, more 2DX coming to the U.S.
4046192	4048714	Hopefully they bring out some other crazy ass games.
4048854	4052057	I wouldn't mind playing that one butt poking game.
4053078	4053818	Boonga Boonga?
4053998	4054739	Yeah, Boonga Boonga.
4054779	4055119	Alright.
4056520	4061344	Let's see, I'm going to put my Miss Cleo hat on here and try to make some Bomani predictions for 2005.
4063766	4066228	Yes, looking deep into my crystal ball.
4067229	4068069	Bomani predictions 2005.
4068110	4068390	Let's see.
4070871	4073673	I predict that there will be an Ultramix 3.
4074413	4076054	There's definitely going to be an Ultramix 3.
4076114	4077435	I predict there will be an Ultramix 3.
4077515	4082399	Because Ultramix 2 is so beloved by the community that there will be an Ultramix 3.
4083339	4086201	And I predict that a different drum will be involved again.
4087782	4089243	Let's see, what else do I predict?
4089343	4093686	I predict that there will be an Extreme 2 in the US.
4094526	4096328	But it won't be called Extreme 2.
4097805	4103288	I think they're going to release... I would say... Remember, I have no inside knowledge here.
4103308	4105469	I'm going completely off my Miss Cleo hat here.
4106310	4114054	I would say that there's going to be an Extreme 2, but they'll call it Party Collection, just to mess with us.
4114194	4116716	But it won't be a rehash of Greatest Hits.
4117456	4118917	It'll be something completely new.
4118957	4127562	And it will have Sakura in it, because everybody bitched when Sakura wasn't in DDR Extreme USA, so there will be Sakura in it.
4131409	4140217	I think about mid-year we're going to see a new DDR arcade machine in Japan.
4140818	4143060	But it's going to be different.
4144949	4145369	That's all.
4146190	4147571	And I think 2DX will continue.
4147871	4153274	There'll still be more Guitar Freak and Drum Mania mixes that we won't know what to do with them.
4153614	4154815	Same thing with pop and music.
4155435	4161198	And I predict that there will be another type of rhythm and music game by the end of the year.
4162139	4163720	Like, you know how they did Mambo Go Go once?
4164180	4165361	I think they're going to try something else.
4167782	4169663	And some people will like it and some won't.
4169743	4170644	That's my prediction.
4171684	4172565	Very vague stuff.
4175984	4178286	G4 will still suck!
4196903	4198464	Any other predictions you want to make, Loki?
4198525	4199445	Oh, he's over there cooking.
4199525	4200086	He doesn't care.
4200606	4201807	He doesn't care about what's going on over here.
4202588	4202828	All right.
4204330	4207052	We were talking a little bit in the last segment before we went to break there.
4207252	4210495	Loki had actually brought up that there is a new DDR machine coming out.
4211276	4214198	Because there is a new DDR machine coming out in the UK.
4214238	4218682	And we actually posted a little news item over to our website, orangeloungeradio.com.
4219403	4220504	And it does appear...
4221204	4228930	That Dancing Stage Fusion Arcade is still happening, and there is some more information on the official Konami site, which you can go to just by clicking on the link there.
4229350	4232252	And it says, and I quote, this is all we have to go off of so far.
4232273	4238157	There's a little picture of the machine, and it says, Spinning its way into Europe is the latest Dancing Stage sensation.
4238617	4245142	Step back onto the stage, take the limelight, and strut your Christmas stuff to Fusion Arcade.
4246872	4257446	Jerry Halliwell, Atomic Kitten, Kim Wilde and a whole host of other well-known artists will be starring in Fusion, making it the biggest and best selection of tracks to date.
4258359	4259900	and that's all they have to say about it.
4260920	4267863	So there is a new machine coming and all these artists we hear there have been in DDR before.
4267923	4276187	Jerry Halliwell, It's Rainin' Men, Atomic Kitten right now, Fifth Mix and Kim Wilde was a home release, Kids in America, right?
4276347	4281089	In DDR Extreme USA and Party Collector, or not Party Collector, Festival.
4281949	4282349	Fusion.
4282769	4283750	Oh, it wasn't in Festival?
4284070	4284790	My bad, my bad.
4285311	4285851	I thought it was.
4286986	4287987	I can't keep them all straight.
4288007	4290689	There's so many DDR mixes, I can't keep them all straight anymore.
4291590	4291870	Alright.
4293451	4294732	So, we know that's coming.
4295252	4296313	We don't have a release date.
4296714	4300076	We don't know if it is a hardware upgrade, what it's going to look like.
4301377	4306481	Loki says it is a hardware upgrade, but we don't know what it's going to look like, which is my point, if you'll let me finish my thought.
4308042	4308563	So, we don't know.
4312606	4312926	Loki's
4315433	4322615	Loki's cooking, so we don't have a microphone right now, but he's yelling about some show where they're going to show this on the 25th through 27th of December?
4322635	4324136	January.
4324216	4325356	January of January.
4325436	4328397	So we should have some more information come the end of January.
4328457	4329938	So that's kind of exciting.
4330558	4331018	A little bit.
4331478	4334379	A little bit, because if something new comes out in Europe, you know, maybe.
4334499	4335039	Maybe here.
4335179	4335460	Maybe.
4336160	4336540	We'll see.
4337480	4339341	I don't know about here, but at least Japan, hopefully.
4339361	4339721	Hopefully.
4341778	4342439	We shall see.
4343260	4343700	Soon enough.
4343820	4346964	Alright, how about we get into tonight's cage match, boys and girls.
4347024	4347804	How's that sound?
4349526	4350047	Terrific.
4351434	4352115	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4375575	4376075	and tonight.
4377576	4380238	And let's see, which track of yours won last week?
4380258	4381119	Was that Speed Demon?
4382540	4382980	I'm sorry.
4386002	4386483	House of Joy.
4386523	4387964	Why don't I have House of Joy queued up here?
4390025	4390946	Alright, I gotta find it.
4393007	4398011	Dark Child, help me fill time here while I figure out where my music is.
4399091	4400733	I'm so depressed, people.
4401513	4402734	You know, I'm single now.
4402754	4404115	That was a shocker to me and
4404932	4410055	I'm trying everything I can to win her back, because that woman was a part of me.
4410655	4412717	She was my soulmate, at least in my eyes.
4413777	4414958	And I miss her so much.
4415198	4421602	If anyone knows any way they could help or advice they could give me to possibly try and win her back, please let me know.
4422482	4423883	I could give you my email address.
4424543	4432928	It's dchild, spelled D-C-H-Y, L-D-E, 999, at yahoo.com.
4433048	4434069	Stalkers, have fun.
4435365	4440146	As long as it doesn't have a forward listed in the beginning of the title, I'll probably read it.
4441167	4443908	Or if it says Tub Girl, you probably will not read it then.
4444108	4445868	No, no, no, I've seen Tub Girl too many times.
4446068	4446508	I don't mind.
4446828	4447329	I'm a freak.
4448789	4454331	And I am an IT guy, so don't try to send me viruses, otherwise I will bring hell on your computer.
4456171	4458072	Alright, let's get into tonight's cage match.
4458472	4458892	Here we go.
4461306	4467789	Last week in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, Loki won it with an old Orange Lounge Radio favorite, Monolithic, a.k.a.
4467829	4469630	Mini Head, and the track is House of Joy.
4470051	4471972	Remember, the Cage Match works this way.
4472392	4477154	Three songs are put into the Cage Match, and you guys vote for your favorite.
4477194	4481777	And the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio Live.
4482697	4483638	So here we go.
4484038	4485099	You guys get to pick.
4485219	4486600	Remember, you get your vote.
4487120	4491504	And you get a clip of last week's winner because you were listening last week, right?
4491524	4492685	So you already heard this song.
4492705	4493665	So you only get a clip.
4494146	4494626	So here it is.
4494706	4496327	Song number one that you can vote for tonight.
4496367	4498329	A clip of Monolithic House of Joy.
4614119	4618063	Alright, song number one, a clip of Monolithic with House of Joy.
4618163	4623108	Will it hold on, or will it bow down to the chatroom challenger?
4623168	4624189	We will see tonight.
4624669	4627632	But I still get a song, so I'm going to put in my song.
4628653	4632437	I downloaded a dance compilation a couple days ago, and I've been grooving to it.
4632937	4636181	There's a lot of cute, poppy little songs on it, so I'm going to put in a nice song.
4636621	4638122	Don't Walk Away Don't Walk Away
4666940	4688609	I've got all this love, waiting just for you I just gotta know that your love is true Can't keep running boy, in and out my life Wanna be your girl, not cause I'm rude, it's right If I had to come inside tomorrow Will you hide, will you be there for me When I need someone to hold Baby, don't be so distant
4747204	4748306	Thank you for watching!
4797060	4802364	I've got all this love waiting just for you I just gotta know that your love is true
4836066	4837130	Thank you for watching!
4870566	4871731	I'll be right there for you
4903328	4913344	Alright, that was song number two, Javine, Don't Walk Away, and let's see if the folks in our studio wanted to walk away or walk real close to that song.
4913645	4915327	Dark Child, what did you think of Don't Walk Away?
4916119	4923501	I thought it was a nice trancy song, you know, kind of uplifting for the mood I'm in, and I liked it.
4924081	4926941	Wow, you're usually full of hatred for our cage match picks.
4926981	4932642	Yeah, but you know, I'm full of hatred when I walked in the door today, and you know, you managed to play a song that kind of uplifted me a bit.
4932762	4933303	Oh, okay.
4935103	4935823	Don't walk away.
4936243	4937463	Javine, don't walk away.
4938704	4940204	Or maybe Javine, I don't know.
4940884	4943885	J-A-V-I-N-E, I want to say Javine, that's what I'm going to say.
4943905	4944705	How about Javine?
4945663	4947263	Javier, alright, give it a score.
4948704	4950144	I'll give it about a 7 right now.
4951064	4956366	You know when I first heard that song I would have given it like an 8, but I really like that song a lot more the more I listen to it.
4957626	4959567	It's very DDR-ish, it reminds me of T.E.F.
4959827	4960367	actually a lot.
4960627	4961087	So I give it a 9.
4961927	4963588	Actually no, I want to give it a 9 too.
4964148	4966669	You know what, Anita, just listen to the song, please.
4967349	4970090	Oh my, okay, Loki, what would you give that song?
4970510	4971130	He's holding up 8.
4972130	4974711	Alright, he's too busy cooking to give a shit about anything else right now.
4975051	4976411	All right, let's get into song number three.
4976471	4977752	Remember, it doesn't matter what we think.
4977952	4980212	It comes down to your guys' votes, so let's find out.
4980672	4981452	All right, here we go.
4981592	4982813	Chat room choice.
4983453	4984493	Big Red Pimp.
4985233	4988254	Ohio Bomani putting this one in on behalf of our chat room.
4989074	4989634	Here it is.
4990094	4991234	And this is... You know what?
4991274	4994655	This is okay because this is the kind of song I could kind of see Jamie putting in.
4994695	4996656	She likes the J-pop and stuff, so this is good.
4997116	5001076	It's Larkin Seal, and the song is called Ready, Steady, Go.
5001156	5003277	Not to be confused with the Paul Oakenfold one, okay?
5004261	5010287	So here it is, the chatroom choice, song number three, Larkin Seal, Ready, Steady, Go.
5010787	5011108	Enjoy!
5061622	5062163	S, Actdeft,
5092272	5092912	S, Actdeft, Drew,
5122269	5124318	Thank you for watching!
5204562	5205825	Thanks for watching!
5247444	5250148	All righty, that was song number three in tonight's cage match.
5251129	5254314	Larkin Seal, Ready Steady Go.
5254554	5255075	What do you think?
5255155	5257038	Ready Steady Go or Ready Steady Go Away?
5257098	5257579	What do you think?
5258981	5260483	Sounds like a pop music song.
5260824	5262366	Sounds like a bunch of pop music songs.
5263111	5265493	I kind of got the Guitar Freak vibe from it.
5265513	5267895	Guitar Freak, pop music, same thing.
5269016	5271197	Oh, I kind of liked it.
5271778	5277262	I saw some people in the chatroom said it sounded kind of like Full Metal Alchemist, which I kind of would have to agree with.
5277282	5280304	I believe that's where the song came from, was an FMA fan site.
5280324	5281465	That's what they were saying, yeah.
5282245	5285688	So, you know, I kind of liked it for a little J-pop-y song.
5287170	5287931	I'll give it about a 7.
5289852	5290952	No, no, I'll give it a 9.
5291032	5293233	Anita, don't listen to the name of that song.
5294394	5295014	Alright.
5297035	5297916	I liked it, actually.
5297956	5298596	It was very good.
5298616	5302578	I was a little wary about letting the chatroom pick something, but I think they did a good job on that one.
5302858	5304999	I guess Angel helped on that, I'm supposed to say.
5305339	5307360	But anyway, I thought it was good.
5307400	5307941	I'd give it about an 8.5.
5308001	5309121	It was good.
5309522	5310862	I could see that in a Babani game.
5310882	5311503	Very poppy.
5311563	5312003	I liked it.
5312083	5312443	Loki.
5313584	5315364	That song sucks!
5317495	5318435	All right.
5318955	5319516	All right, fair enough.
5339727	5347169	I'm glad the chat room could get a little bit of what that's like to have your song dissed by Loki because that happens to me every freaking week.
5349410	5351910	Luckily it's not up to him though, it's up to you guys.
5351990	5355211	So here we go, three songs, here's a recap.
5355231	5358492	You can place your votes right after this recap of the three songs you can vote for tonight.
5358552	5360553	Song number one, Monolithic, House of Joy.
5371946	5375327	Song number two you can vote for tonight, Javeen, Don't Walk Away.
5384891	5388653	Song number three you can vote for tonight, Larkin Seal, Ready Steady Go.
5400965	5404026	All right, place vote now.
5404147	5407888	Send a private message to Sky in the chatroom with your vote.
5408248	5411089	Will Monolithic, a fan favorite, hold on for tonight?
5411529	5413950	Will the chatroom pick make it in?
5414030	5417232	After all, it was picked by the chatroom, so it kind of gets some instant votes there.
5417272	5418892	That's kind of unfair, but we'll see.
5419393	5424475	Or will Javine kind of sneak in there, end up getting through a split vote, and walk away with it?
5424495	5424875	We'll see.
5425675	5427217	In the famous words of P. Diddy, vote or die.
5448873	5451214	Plenty of votes already, so we'll see.
5451674	5457216	Alright, let's see, I wanted to open up the Skype line to hopefully talk to some of our callers.
5457276	5464918	I just wanted to check out, you know, what kind of loot you guys got for Christmas, especially when it comes to games and video games and things like that.
5464958	5467119	I'm kind of curious about what kind of loot you guys got.
5467499	5470400	If you were naughty or nice this year, what Santa brought you instead.
5471970	5472670	So we'll see.
5472991	5474251	I'm going to open up the Skype line there.
5474271	5481014	Remember, if you want more information on the Skype line, head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on Interact With Us.
5481554	5485196	For those of you guys that are kind of new to Orange Lounge Radio, the Skype line allows you to talk.
5485276	5488577	All you've got to have is a microphone, and then you don't have to have a phone.
5488617	5489897	All you've got to do is call over the Internet.
5490278	5495820	Please, though, before you call the show, make sure all your pornography torrents are turned off.
5496420	5502364	because it will fudge up your bandwidth and then we have a hard time hearing you and we have to hang up on you.
5502444	5503205	We don't like doing that.
5505266	5510289	I know Loki does enjoy hanging up on people, but please turn the porn torrents off before you call.
5510449	5514072	And for the love of God, first rule of real radio, and it applies to internet radio as well,
5514472	5516153	Turn your speakers down when you call in, please.
5516273	5518814	Because we don't need to hear ourselves, okay?
5518854	5521155	We hear enough of ourselves doing this show.
5521235	5525377	So please do not leave your speakers up when you call in.
5525437	5526898	So we'll wait and see if anybody calls in.
5527799	5533361	I do notice that we only have about half the people listening tonight that we usually do, which is kind of a hit for us.
5535618	5539279	I understand why, probably because a lot of folks are away doing the holiday thing.
5539319	5544200	They're at mommy's house or grandma's house or something and they're doing the holiday stuff.
5544400	5547220	They're playing with their new DS or they're doing something.
5548780	5554722	We just don't have the same amount of people that we usually do, so they'll be all tuning in Friday on DER Freak to catch what they missed.
5555042	5557442	And that's at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time, if you want to hear that.
5557942	5561743	Also, though, we do have other spin-off programming here on Orange Lounge Radio, including...
5562628	5564929	Diversion, the Orange Lounge Radio Remix show.
5565089	5566170	That's on Monday nights.
5566870	5569752	And Tuesday nights, Pump Up the Volume featuring DarkSakura.
5569792	5570692	Hopefully she'll be back.
5570792	5574434	I know she's a little bit sick, but she should be coming back this Tuesday.
5574474	5574855	We'll see.
5574875	5575575	We'll check in with her.
5575615	5576455	Hopefully she's doing alright.
5576956	5580258	And then Thursday nights, Outside the Box, where...
5581258	5585801	Myself, RicePrincess, and LikeyStyle talk about all sorts of other video gaming things.
5586662	5588623	Maybe postpone this week.
5589284	5590985	LikeyStyle had some work issues come up.
5591005	5592166	He's not been able to come to the show.
5592546	5593487	I should be here, though.
5593747	5596069	We might just do a Sky experience, if nothing else.
5596629	5597129	So we'll see.
5598170	5599531	So that's all the programming you can look forward to.
5599851	5603214	And something else brand new.
5604314	5607477	Something brand new we're looking to roll out this week.
5608288	5615595	But we're not going to talk about it just yet, because we want to make sure all the T's are crossed and all the I's are dotted.
5616276	5621320	It's a new program, but it's not something you're going to hear on Live365.
5622522	5624363	But I'm going to spoil it for you right now.
5624704	5627346	It's going to be the Loki fried rice experience.
5627486	5627967	Woohoo!
5630309	5630549	Ass.
5632791	5633072	Alright.
5634266	5634886	DarkSakura.com
5664951	5666272	That's about number nine on the list.
5668734	5669254	So we'll see.
5669294	5669754	We're hoping.
5669834	5672316	Watch our website, www.orangeentree.com.
5672356	5673076	Watch the website.
5673536	5676198	We should have more information on that sometime this week.
5677719	5677919	All right.
5677979	5679260	Nobody's calling in the Skype line.
5679280	5680140	You guys are all shy.
5680261	5680781	I see how it is.
5681021	5681401	It's fine.
5681781	5682082	It's fine.
5682102	5683823	Well, we only have about half the people we usually do.
5683863	5685744	I think a lot of our regular callers are out tonight.
5686204	5686584	So fine.
5686604	5686865	Whatever.
5687405	5688746	One other thing I wanted to talk about.
5689659	5693500	I want to talk about some of the things coming up with the new year.
5693520	5696461	We've been talking about our predictions for what Bomani is going to look like in the new year.
5696901	5700322	How about those new year's resolutions you don't intend on keeping?
5701042	5705164	What are some of those new year's resolutions you guys are going to be setting that you do not intend on keeping?
5705384	5706864	Or maybe you do intend on keeping it.
5706984	5707344	I don't know.
5707424	5707744	Loki.
5708825	5709425	Celibacy.
5712168	5714991	Come on, that's not even something you would ever even suggest.
5715691	5718634	I'm talking about things that you might actually consider doing.
5719194	5720335	You're not going to be celibate.
5721597	5723278	I think your girlfriend would have a problem with that.
5723298	5725440	Or maybe not, I don't know.
5726281	5727702	You're pretty quick to say that.
5727722	5730905	Do you have any serious things you want to commit yourself to doing?
5730945	5733647	Like, I don't know, maybe sit-ups?
5736830	5737631	Finishing the cabinets?
5741092	5753560	Dark Child, New Year's Resolutions you don't intend on keeping?
5754060	5755641	Oh, I intend on keeping all of them.
5756562	5759604	Alright, well, anything you want to share with our, that would be appropriate to share with our listeners?
5760505	5764247	Yeah, basically, uh, to grow up finally.
5764587	5768230	You know, I've been acting a lot younger than I should be, and
5771006	5774648	All right, we're going to go to the phones because we got a call, so let's go to the phones.
5774768	5776669	Hello, you're on Orange Zones Radio.
5777209	5777609	Yo.
5778070	5778770	Hi, who dis?
5779490	5780211	Big Red Pimp.
5780391	5782012	Hello, Big Red Pimp, how are you?
5782972	5783753	I'm pretty good.
5783933	5786554	All right, I have to ask, why Big Red Pimp?
5787675	5790536	Tall, red-headed, and dressed like a damn.
5791177	5792137	Okay, okay, I got it.
5792417	5795139	Now, you were the guy that picked Larkin Seal, Ready, Steady, Go!
5795179	5796199	for tonight's cage match, right?
5796920	5797080	Yep.
5797360	5798981	All right, why did you choose that song?
5800348	5802329	I'm just hooked on Full Metal Alchemist right now.
5802549	5804890	Okay, so you're on a Full Metal Alchemist kick, so that works.
5805610	5805890	Alright.
5806230	5806971	How was your Christmas?
5807031	5807651	Oh, by the way.
5807871	5808111	Yes.
5808451	5811353	Loki had to vote for your song just to be civil about it.
5811993	5814554	Oh, so you voted for Loki's song just to be civil?
5816134	5816315	Yep.
5817155	5817595	Oh, that's it.
5817775	5823637	So, even though you went and hated on that song, Loki, he went and voted for your song.
5823697	5824638	Wasn't that nice of him?
5825418	5826819	He just realized what the better song was.
5827179	5828499	Oh, snap.
5828579	5829760	What do you have to say about that?
5831095	5835618	I'd have a dirt clod for you.
5836839	5837500	How was your Christmas?
5837540	5838100	How was your holiday?
5838901	5841783	It was pretty good, other than getting a migraine from my niece.
5842343	5842823	Oh, I'm sorry.
5843043	5843684	How old's your niece?
5844364	5845085	Four years old.
5845365	5845725	I see.
5845845	5847747	Most four-year-olds do cause migraines.
5848027	5849388	Happens at the arcade all the time.
5850549	5851890	Did you get what you wanted for Christmas?
5852950	5854412	Not quite, except for the money.
5855332	5855833	Money's good.
5855873	5857013	What did you ask for for Christmas?
5858695	5858995	Nothing.
5859655	5860676	You didn't ask for anything?
5861471	5864093	I didn't ask for anything because nobody could afford anything.
5864133	5867496	Well, then you can't be disappointed with what you got if you didn't have anything on your list, right?
5867837	5868397	Exactly.
5868757	5870019	There you go.
5870479	5873061	I'd be disappointed if I asked for nothing and someone gave me something.
5875583	5879527	He says he'd be a little disappointed if he asked for nothing and then he got something.
5880814	5884075	At least this year I have heat in the house, so I don't have to worry about anything.
5884335	5884775	There you go.
5885875	5894377	Now see, me personally, I don't make lists either, but I'm very grateful with whatever I get, because I always like when people buy me things, because hey, free stuff.
5895678	5899298	And see, the best thing about getting money is that you're not disappointed with whatever you buy.
5899859	5900419	Exactly.
5900539	5903119	Money is a great Christmas present.
5903159	5903600	There you go.
5904140	5906100	Any New Year's resolutions you don't intend on keeping?
5907821	5909421	To get off this caffeine high.
5910137	5911380	Get off the caffeine high.
5911680	5913204	How much caffeine would you say you're drinking a day?
5914402	5921565	Actually, I stopped last week, but I've been kind of dipping out into a little bit of caffeine, so I'm like one can of Pepsi a day.
5921645	5927708	Well, you know that's why you're getting the migraines there, because you're kicking the caffeine habit, and so caffeine is something that helps prevent migraines.
5928008	5941354	This happened to me a lot when I kicked the caffeine habit, because I used to be the kind of guy, I would drink one of those 20-ounce bottles of Mountain Dew, Code Red, every morning to wake up, and I kicked it, and I got a lot of headaches when I quit, but I'll tell you what, I lost a lot of weight too.
5941374	5942995	Yeah, I kicked my caffeine habit.
5943035	5943475	I was on
5944005	5945867	Like six mocha frappe full bars a day.
5945927	5947368	That's five shots of espresso in there.
5947848	5949310	Plus all kinds of other espresso drinks.
5949330	5950250	I worked at a coffee shop.
5950310	5950811	It was horrible.
5950851	5953413	But when I quit it, you know, I was shaking, migraines and everything.
5953433	5954314	But eventually I did.
5954554	5954814	Ugly.
5955155	5955395	Ugly.
5955615	5959378	I had no choice but to get off the caffeine because I kind of had a panic attack.
5959999	5960820	Oh, ouch.
5961160	5964823	Well, I hope this is the road to getting better for you then.
5964883	5971389	I think you're going to find, though, that, you know, when you stop drinking all that soda and if you ever decide that you can switch from Pepsi to Diet Pepsi...
5972574	5975055	That you'll start losing weight because it's all these calories.
5975375	5976335	That's how I lost anyway.
5976355	5979035	Of course, I gained it all back over Christmas, but that's alright.
5979756	5980416	I'll lose it again.
5981896	5983456	Some suggestions in the chatroom as well.
5984677	5987517	Rayum says in our chatroom, extra water helps with a migraine.
5987777	5989198	So drink tons of water.
5991298	5991718	Okay.
5991878	5992178	Alright.
5992378	5994319	Some friendly advice from us here at Orange Lounge Radio.
5995559	5996619	Alright, I'll get off here now.
5996779	5997659	Alright, feel better.
5998940	5999500	Alright, bye.
6000839	6003420	New Caller, we like it when new people call in, yay.
6004440	6007481	And then we don't look so stupid by not getting any calls, so that makes me feel really good.
6008041	6013202	Alright, we're going to go to a break, and in this break we're going to take care of a few requests.
6013222	6025705	We had some songs that were requested, so we're going to take care of those, and I'm going to grab myself some fried rice, dammit, because that stuff is smelling very good, and I want some, so I'm going to... What did you say?
6026165	6028526	It's a little heavy on the soy sauce, I put a little too much.
6029144	6030845	That's alright, cancer sounds fine to me.
6031626	6033207	Don't they say that causes cancer or something?
6033748	6034048	I don't know.
6035029	6035769	One way to find out.
6036290	6038031	Alright, we'll go to this break.
6038051	6041434	We're going to tally up the cage match votes and figure out about that when we come back.
6042034	6044036	We'll get to the FUs of the week at some point as well.
6044536	6047139	We'll be back after this on Orange Launch Radio.
6166947	6169068	Thanks for watching!
6223966	6226507	Lala Lala Lala Lala Lala Lala Lala
6365492	6366733	Thank you for watching!
6403429	6404713	I'm a dream, it's unreal
6430896	6439904	And now it's time for Erotic Pop Idol, where we will find the next singer for everyone's favorite perverse Bomani band, Erotic.
6440344	6442386	Do it all night, do it with me.
6442826	6445208	No, no, that was awful, bloody terrible.
6445248	6446610	Do you take vocal lessons?
6446690	6447650	Kill your teacher.
6448151	6449172	In the heat of the night.
6449632	6451874	Oh, God, I think my ears are bleeding.
6453055	6453736	I liked it.
6454256	6455797	Shut the bloody hell up, Paula.
6455917	6456338	Next.
6462100	6463861	Do you even know why you're here?
6463881	6465642	That was just bloody pathetic!
6465722	6466182	Next!
6471545	6471785	Yes!
6472185	6472845	Yes, that's it!
6473185	6474346	We have a winner!
6475146	6485731	A star is born here on Orange Lounge Radio Yes, a star is born here on Orange Lounge Radio Remember when I always used to say that when we played that promo?
6487202	6488962	She did beatboxing and scene.
6489483	6490323	No wonder she won.
6491643	6492403	I know, amazing.
6494524	6500525	That's an old promo, but I thought I would play that because isn't American Idol coming back pretty soon?
6500845	6502226	Doesn't that usually show up in January?
6503406	6504586	I don't know, I don't watch it anymore.
6505306	6506227	As I became retarded.
6506247	6507547	Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
6507647	6511208	You and the girlfriend used to watch it every single week religiously.
6511228	6512048	What the hell's going on?
6512668	6513948	Yeah, that was like two years ago.
6514629	6515929	We also used to watch The Apprentice.
6516587	6517588	Didn't do that anymore.
6518208	6520169	We also used to watch Survivor.
6520389	6521069	Stopped doing that.
6522530	6522830	Why?
6523571	6525452	Because the shows just got tired.
6525712	6526532	They need to be retired.
6527193	6528593	No, no, you just want to have sex more.
6531375	6531915	Shows are tired.
6532976	6534296	And you started watching Queer Eye.
6535557	6536758	Yeah, but we've already seen all those.
6538679	6539519	So now they're all reruns.
6540900	6541160	All right.
6542719	6544600	If I sound like I'm eating right now, it's because I am.
6545000	6545980	You should get some of this, Dark Knight.
6546000	6546400	It's very good.
6546921	6548321	It's some of Loki's fried rice.
6549161	6550662	Did I say Dark Knight?
6551742	6552343	Dark Child.
6554624	6557825	You people with Dark in your name, you're all the same.
6558765	6565748	Dark Dragon, Dark Person, Dark Demon, Dark... You know, what?
6566148	6567689	I say we just quit the show.
6567729	6569689	We'll take Dark Knight here and go trick-or-treating.
6570290	6571030	See, you did it too!
6572093	6574233	That's okay, because remember, I have a new nickname now.
6575094	6576394	I'm no longer Dark Child.
6576674	6578014	I'm now Darkophelion.
6578894	6579955	He's now Dark Man.
6581215	6582295	No longer a child.
6582795	6583775	He has become a man.
6587616	6589277	Dark Man died, died, died.
6589677	6590297	I like it.
6591417	6593758	Yeah, let's not confuse him with that really horrible movie.
6594958	6596538	It actually had sequels.
6597358	6597698	Why?
6599279	6600439	Wait, isn't that Donnie Darko?
6601420	6603001	No, Dark Man.
6603021	6606122	Remember the stupid guy with his face got burnt off or something?
6606562	6611744	So he makes a new face, and it's like the whole Phantom of the Opera thing going, but really stupid.
6611784	6613505	Wasn't that Mel Gibson, the man without a face?
6614165	6615786	No, no, no, this is Dark Man.
6616146	6626130	It's just like another line in the series, just like the Tremors movies, just like Species, just like... Oh, what's another really shitty movie that they made a lot of?
6626651	6627211	The Relic.
6629249	6631431	No, Nightmare on Elm Street, actually, everything's theatrical.
6631511	6633973	It's just, um, like, uh, Hellraiser.
6633993	6636875	There are all these horror movies that just keep having sequels.
6636895	6637716	Children of the Corn.
6638257	6639237	Children of the Corn.
6639798	6643741	There are all these horror movies that have, like, tons of sequels that no one ever hears about.
6644061	6644902	The Leprechaun.
6645302	6647784	It's just like, Leprechaun, back in the hood.
6648264	6651287	Leprechaun 2, in the hood, back to the hood.
6652167	6654890	Like, they thought they needed, you know, we just don't have enough...
6655791	6657732	Leprechaun in the Hood, We Need More.
6659352	6660633	Who makes these decisions?
6660733	6661273	Seriously.
6661993	6664414	Was that like, well, this is the best thing we've got.
6665015	6667235	I mean, is that bad over there?
6667275	6667716	I swear.
6669876	6675839	I mean, honestly, I have seen horror movies that I don't know how the fuck they get distributed on tape.
6676639	6677981	I mean, because I collect these things.
6678161	6682305	I have, like, I say the worst movie I have ever seen other than Manos and the Hands of Fate.
6682325	6685829	Because Manos, I've watched that on Mystery Science Theater 3000.
6685909	6687150	I've watched it by itself.
6687751	6690514	No matter what, that movie is so boring, it will put me to sleep every time.
6691175	6694098	You survived watching it with itself, not Mystery Science Theater?
6695037	6695558	It was hard.
6696238	6697199	Now wait, here we go, here we go.
6697440	6698641	I got a brilliant idea.
6698681	6700443	We're going to kill two birds with one stone.
6700503	6708291	Since we are Orange Lounge Radio, and we are a Bomani, supposedly we're about Bomani and music video games, supposedly, although we know we're really not.
6710593	6711574	We're all about that.
6712415	6715959	And we like horror movies, and we've decided we need to make a direct-to-video horror movie.
6715979	6716359	Here it is.
6716840	6717481	We're going to make...
6718544	6720404	DDR Freak, the horror movie.
6720824	6721345	What do you think?
6721445	6724305	Because everybody's been complaining about how they want to see a DDR Freak movie.
6724605	6725125	There you go.
6725425	6726906	We'll just have it be a horror movie.
6727026	6731806	We'll film it at Golfland and like children will die, only they're really dying.
6732467	6733167	That's stupid.
6735447	6738688	I think it'd be alright as long as it doesn't have a sequel called DDR Spot.
6738968	6740988	And then Warwick Davis will be in it.
6743188	6744589	Give me back me pot of gold.
6744669	6745829	Give me back me tokens.
6747820	6748581	Oh my god.
6749181	6749661	No.
6750602	6750862	No.
6751883	6755144	See, the thing with DDR is it doesn't translate well at all to cinema.
6755164	6758747	You just, there's no... Okay, you got served.
6758787	6759427	Case in point.
6759467	6760528	Oh, well, actually, wait a minute.
6760548	6763329	I'm kind of fighting myself here on our... Hey, you forgot about Wasabi.
6763349	6764770	The DDR part of that was tight.
6766591	6767231	I didn't remember that.
6767271	6774716	But anyways, the whole point of it is there's no actual story to DDR, so you cannot make, you know, a DDR movie.
6774876	6776477	What if you had DDR... Now...
6777651	6778612	What about The Wizard?
6779793	6783696	You can't make a movie about video games, but they made this, you know, going plot.
6783776	6785277	That wasn't Super Mario Bros.
6785397	6785757	movies.
6785857	6787198	Shut your damn mouth for a minute.
6787959	6793863	What if they had, it's like The Wizard, like that was 15 years ago, and you know how they remake movies once they're, you know, so old?
6794244	6797686	We could remake The Wizard, but now the central thing is DDR.
6798147	6802630	And there's a kid, and it could star DDR Bot, because he's a kid, right?
6803130	6804852	And DDR Bot is like this product.
6804892	6805292	California!
6805712	6806272	Exactly!
6806533	6808554	He's this prodigy at DDR.
6808574	6810735	Hey, he took first place at Max Games.
6812276	6812896	Okay, here we go.
6813197	6813857	I'm on a thigh here.
6813897	6822782	Okay, so DDR bot, kid who's really good at DDR, and he's going to Universal Studios for the big DDR tournament.
6822802	6823903	What did they call it in The Wizard?
6823923	6824544	What was the name of it?
6824624	6825084	Armageddon!
6825324	6826705	DDRmageddon!
6827525	6827685	Right?
6827745	6830047	So that'll be the tournament that's at Universal Studios.
6830527	6831648	And then when we get there...
6833305	6838408	DDR Extreme 2, a game that nobody's ever seen.
6838808	6848213	And then, like, you could be in it, and you've got, like, this device that you have on your feet, the Power Boots, and it's like, no, that's so stupid.
6848233	6850615	The Power Boots, they're so bad.
6853137	6856602	And they have little LED lights in them that light up to the music.
6856863	6857864	Yeah, right.
6859005	6864032	And then will DDR Bot mysteriously just know the secret code for the game even though it just came out?
6864052	6868539	That could be Mel B, because Mel B would have the power boots.
6869465	6870445	Think about it, guys.
6870645	6871166	Think about it.
6871826	6875727	And then, like, see, DDR Bot and his wacky friends.
6875947	6877048	And we'll be the wacky friends.
6877108	6879349	You, me, and DarkSakura can be the wacky friends.
6879369	6882170	Because you remember... Shut up!
6882430	6888052	You remember that in The Wizard there was that sassy girl that went with him that, ah, he touched my breast.
6888132	6888692	Remember that?
6888832	6890172	That could be DarkSakura.
6890973	6892273	Ah, he touched my breast.
6892633	6893234	There you go.
6894594	6897195	And then, like, you and I can somehow be Fred Savage.
6898834	6900035	This is great.
6900135	6902837	I'm freaking writing a letter to Warner Brothers tomorrow.
6903358	6905900	Well, they did make Catwoman, so why not?
6907461	6909663	No, honestly, that's a retarded idea.
6909803	6911044	How about a horror movie?
6913206	6913887	Oh, okay, okay.
6914227	6916489	Okay, and then at the end, everybody gets killed.
6916689	6917149	There you go.
6917590	6918070	Oh, okay.
6918210	6919531	Except DDR Bot, because he's cool.
6919772	6922094	But Yumi and Jamie, we die horrible, gruesome deaths.
6923515	6927138	DDR Bot does like a whole Children of the Corn thing, and he's the reason everybody dies.
6927178	6927358	He's like,
6927861	6929202	Gozal, Carrie Fisher on him.
6930803	6931283	There you go.
6931803	6932644	See, I'm liking this.
6933965	6935326	I should write movies.
6935486	6936346	I would be a millionaire.
6940249	6942230	There's so many bad movies out there.
6943431	6946092	And they're just, you know, they keep on making them.
6946213	6948814	Like, um... Let's see here.
6949815	6950315	Oh, I don't know.
6950355	6951156	House of the Dead?
6951896	6952456	Awful movie.
6952637	6954838	I still have to watch that just because it's so bad.
6955298	6955839	I honestly...
6957054	6957815	It's so bad.
6960698	6961278	Shut up.
6963561	6964942	How about we just have the Power Glove again?
6964982	6967064	It wouldn't make any sense anyways, so why not?
6967084	6971709	Okay, the Power Glove allows you to play DDR with your hand.
6972810	6973651	Like a virtual keyboard?
6974593	6977356	Like, no, you can wave your hand and it does things.
6977376	6978738	You know what's sad?
6978758	6980120	Para para, I don't know.
6980300	6989293	For like half a second, I think, this week while I was sitting there board drooling in front of my computer monitor, I think I actually thought about trying to use a Power Glove in such fashion.
6990154	6993439	Here we go, here we go, I know how we can end the DDR movie, okay?
6993879	6996082	So DDR Bot wins the tournament, okay?
6996503	7003873	And then in this classic Hollywood ending, you know those things that would never happen in real life, this is what happens at the end of the movie, you ready for it?
7004494	7007178	All the male DDR players get laid.
7010157	7026286	even better ALIEN SPACECRAFT COME FROM THE SKY WE NEED YOU TO COME TO SAVE THE WORLD yeah it could be like one of those really stupid movies like where you know music will save the world or something like that one of those alien movies where they have to play DDR to save the world cause that's awesome
7027026	7027467	D.D.R.
7027507	7028387	to save the world.
7028668	7033031	And then you can have really horrible renditions of the D.D.R.
7033071	7033452	characters.
7033812	7041338	Like, for instance, you know, Guile played by Jean-Claude Van Damme.
7041518	7044921	Okay, with the fucking carrots.
7045882	7047823	Rage can be played by The Rock.
7049285	7052988	And, let's see, Emmy would be played by Angelina Jolie.
7054417	7055338	I'm liking this so far.
7055818	7057699	And they could be like the comic relief.
7057759	7063263	Like they show up along our journey and provide that random sage advice.
7065404	7066005	I'm liking this.
7066065	7067186	I'm going to go write this all down.
7068466	7075731	Naoki will be played by Harvey Fierstein.
7075791	7077052	Oh my god, you guys!
7077453	7079994	You've got to go to the DDI tournament and play my song.
7080174	7080214	Oh!
7081331	7082612	I gotta call my mother!
7082632	7087696	That would be hilarious to have like some sort of arena, like Iron Chef, and he would be like the chairman.
7088737	7090898	You know, cause he's like flamboyant like the chairman.
7094981	7095742	God, it's wrong!
7096082	7097743	It's so wrong, I feel so dirty!
7098764	7099285	Alright, alright.
7100005	7102247	Uh, we got comments in our chatroom here.
7102287	7106150	DJ Ranma S says, by the way, there was an actual DDR movie.
7107438	7108678	God, we beat this thing to death.
7108738	7109739	It was really bad.
7110259	7114820	There was a plot written for one, and Haley Jo Osment was cast for the role of the hero.
7114840	7115960	I don't believe that for half a second.
7116000	7116480	I'm sorry to say.
7116500	7117181	Nope, that's fake.
7117701	7119601	Ranma, nothing against you.
7119861	7122242	I don't know where you got that news from.
7123222	7127423	Maybe it did come from a legitimate news source, but I'm sorry to say.
7127463	7128284	Oh, come on, look at this.
7128444	7129504	It's a pile of shit.
7130966	7131487	Uh-oh!
7131767	7132067	Yes!
7132407	7137171	Did you know that the D... Doctor Movie, because D-R... What are you looking at?
7137191	7139713	You're looking at some page over on Tripod.
7140113	7140813	It's shit.
7140853	7141414	This is not...
7142312	7143592	What the hell are these people doing?
7143752	7147974	I think it's somebody having the same conversation on AOL that we just had, basically.
7148254	7150135	Except they've got Miss Cleo in their movie.
7150515	7152475	Please, please people, please.
7152856	7155376	Miss Cleo is so three years ago.
7155757	7156077	Okay?
7156737	7157097	Stop.
7157377	7157837	Now, now.
7158237	7160818	She was in DDR Vice City.
7160858	7162919	No, in Grand Theft Auto Vice City.
7165540	7170221	I like DJ Ranma's new idea because it's Team DDR to battle Team Pump It Up.
7170702	7171802	I'm down for that movie.
7172825	7176428	Afro, played by Samuel Jackson.
7176448	7180151	The whole last 15 minutes of the movie is them just serving each other back and forth.
7181852	7182413	I love it.
7182633	7185955	And they can shoot lasers when they have a combo.
7186075	7186496	I don't know.
7186556	7187657	It's fucking retarded.
7187677	7189818	All right, we're going to reopen up the Skype.
7189938	7191039	Actually, I take it back.
7191059	7195823	There is only one way that there could be a DDR movie, and this could actually work.
7196424	7198745	Now, anyone out there has probably read it.
7199046	7201568	It's the 10K commotion, which is...
7202529	7209074	A webcomic out there right now, and that actually does have a storyline that does involve DDR that would actually translate well into film.
7209154	7209935	No, here it is, here it is.
7210475	7212176	Kevin Smith writes a DDR movie.
7212557	7213077	Oh, God.
7213677	7220943	And it's just about a bunch of slackers, which is true to life, that go to play DDR and just, you know, the wacky antics that ensue.
7221743	7222204	There you go.
7222644	7224646	Is it going to be called Hot Arrow Sex?
7225166	7228088	With sex spelled, you know, S-E-C-X?
7228348	7228789	There you go.
7229909	7231771	See, I'm full of good ideas here.
7232772	7233673	This is the only thing.
7233953	7238398	Joel Schumacher is not allowed to direct the DDR movie because he ruins everything he touches!
7238638	7239219	Everything!
7239739	7242122	He did not ruin the Phantom of the Opera.
7242803	7244424	He put his poo on it a little bit.
7245085	7246526	I did see the smearing of the poo.
7247127	7247948	It could have been better.
7248408	7249730	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
7250851	7251392	Hey, what's up?
7251692	7252373	Hi, who is this?
7253334	7253714	Outface.
7254175	7254876	Hi, Outface.
7254956	7256217	Is this THE Outface?
7257418	7258339	Oh my god, yes.
7258479	7258960	Oh my god.
7259060	7259981	Oh my god.
7260141	7260821	I don't think you are.
7260841	7262283	Alright, you have a comment.
7263784	7267708	Um, that whole movie idea is just not really right.
7268909	7269169	No.
7269210	7269750	You know what?
7269870	7272873	It's better than half the shit that Hollywood's putting out anyway.
7273153	7274675	Did you see Crossroads?
7274955	7275616	Did you see it?
7278096	7280758	Britney Spears, Three Friends, no, forget it.
7281038	7281699	I mean, come on.
7282139	7284662	I would watch the DDR movie 20 times before I'd watch it.
7284682	7289065	There's only one situation I want to see with Britney Spears and Three Friends, and that was in Crossroads.
7290307	7291908	Although Crossroads could be a title.
7293910	7295731	I'm sorry, Michael, did you have another comment?
7297773	7300436	I don't know.
7301016	7302798	You had to get a hell of a lot better actors than them.
7303408	7304029	I know, I know.
7304069	7305490	You'd have to get some decent actors.
7305790	7306932	We would just have to get unknowns.
7306992	7309034	Basically, it would star us, is the deal.
7309114	7312577	Alright, how was your holiday?
7314139	7314679	It was alright.
7314919	7315300	It was alright?
7315320	7316341	Did you get any good stuff?
7316701	7318002	Did Santa bring you some good stuff?
7319163	7319564	Oh, yeah.
7319944	7320825	Xbox is about it.
7321105	7321606	Well, there you go.
7321786	7323247	Are you gonna play Ultramix 2?
7324709	7325510	Not bloody likely.
7326491	7327532	Any particular reason why?
7331291	7332872	Do you even play DDR, sir?
7333513	7333773	Really?
7334574	7335674	Do you even play DDR?
7336875	7338036	Yeah, DDR.
7338557	7341039	But DDR, Guitar Freak, crap like that.
7341219	7342160	There you go, there you go.
7342200	7343761	But not interested in Ultramix 2?
7344782	7345382	No, not really.
7345402	7346183	Alright, well there you go.
7346823	7348905	It's not Japanese enough for you, or what's the deal?
7349866	7350806	Eh, it was alright.
7351167	7353949	Maybe it's the console that it plays on is the size of a house.
7355939	7357180	Alright, then what games are you going to play?
7357240	7358261	Are you a Halo person?
7358321	7359062	Is that what it's all about?
7359883	7361004	Oh yeah, Halo is the shit.
7361064	7361524	There you go.
7361704	7362525	You're a Halo person.
7362685	7363426	I understand that.
7363866	7366349	I played Halo 2 for two weeks, and then I gave up.
7366729	7367310	Because I suck.
7369592	7370032	It happens.
7370372	7372494	Any New Year's resolutions you don't intend on keeping?
7373455	7374436	Oh, hell yeah.
7374596	7375017	Like what?
7375417	7378180	I plan on not spending so much money on the ARK, but that is so not going to work.
7379273	7381095	It so doesn't work for me every year either.
7381736	7384940	Unless the arcades turn to shit, then it's easy to not go.
7385320	7386582	Or they get overrun with children.
7389425	7389946	Anything else?
7391247	7391527	Nah.
7392048	7392789	Have a good one, boss.
7393149	7394411	Alright, thanks for calling.
7394551	7395052	Have a good one.
7396397	7398498	The winner of tonight's cage match
7423214	7425076	Really shouldn't be too hard to figure out.
7425116	7427899	You let the chatroom pick, and the chatroom wins.
7430381	7431662	Yeah, I get to pick a better song.
7431702	7432823	Ready, steady, go.
7433324	7434385	In your face, Loki.
7435226	7435806	In your face.
7435987	7436947	You got served.
7437728	7438469	I won last week.
7438489	7439130	What do I care?
7439290	7440050	I was making rice.
7440511	7441432	I'm full, man.
7442393	7443774	I am so goddamn full.
7444114	7444395	Alright.
7444994	7446094	We're going to go to a break, you guys.
7446114	7456658	When we come back, we are going to do the FUs of the week, and I know you guys have probably got quite a few things that you're a little bit angsty about this week, especially with the holidays.
7456958	7462780	So go ahead and send in those FUs of the week now, and we'll get to those when we come back after this break, featuring music.
7463200	7467661	Since he kind of got me thinking about Ultramix 2, I think we're going to play some stuff from Ultramix 2.
7467901	7468702	How's that sound, you guys?
7469182	7469982	I'm nuts.
7471212	7471493	Shut up.
7471533	7473277	We're gonna play some Ultramix 2 stuff and we'll be back.
7473297	7476044	We're gonna start it off with I Feel, the Junk Circuit mix.
7476164	7477488	We'll be back after this.
7479673	7480415	Do you feel it?
7503860	7504702	Thanks for watching!
7558802	7559590	You can hear it.
7589368	7590057	Thanks for watching!
7701660	7716090	Baby, only the strong will survive Oh, the misery, the life Only factors will keep you away In the lonely peace of the broken ship
7731281	7733663	I will meet you there, cause I need you there
7765464	7766425	Thank you for watching!
7804288	7808610	Orange Lounge Radio is proud to present a celebrity interview.
7809471	7811112	Can you introduce yourself for our listeners?
7811592	7812413	I'm Miss Cleo.
7812973	7814554	Oh, it's great to have you on the show today.
7814894	7815995	Hello, how are you today?
7816523	7817464	I'm great, thanks.
7817644	7818664	Did you have a question?
7819085	7819685	Well, yes.
7820065	7825008	Actually, I wanted to know... Can I please have your first name only and your birth date, please?
7826109	7827870	Uh, well, no.
7828090	7830731	I actually just wanted to know what you thought of Orange Lounge Radio.
7830992	7831872	Alright, go ahead.
7832232	7835414	Well, what do you think of Loki, one of the three hosts of Orange Lounge Radio?
7835754	7836635	Is he incarcerated?
7837588	7838629	Actually, no, he's not.
7838689	7840931	But what do you think of the ever-ranty DarkSakura?
7841071	7842352	Hi, dear, how are you?
7842932	7843673	I love you.
7843893	7845394	I see you two must know each other.
7845514	7846795	Well, what do you think of Skye?
7847115	7849037	Did he used to play football when he was in high school?
7849297	7850738	Well, actually, no, he didn't.
7851959	7853820	Well, what do you think of Intern Zero?
7854260	7857643	I want you to really remember the pill, alright?
7858123	7860105	I'm seeing some forgetting, possibly.
7860405	7863327	And I'm seeing a new baby in the next three months.
7864080	7867683	Right, okay, well, thanks for being on Orange Lounge Radio today.
7867843	7872886	Um, I don't mean to sidetrack your question here, but... Who are all of these nosy people?
7873147	7876449	Outside influences I'm seeing around you by the moon card.
7876629	7877570	Get away from me.
7880092	7884915	Orange Lounge Radio, helping to free your mind and spirit.
7885395	7886216	I'm Miss Cleo.
7886596	7887337	I love you.
7888778	7891600	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and...
7892782	7895323	Yeah, that Miss Cleo thing, so four years ago, right?
7897164	7897945	We can't hear you, buddy.
7898045	7898625	Is the mic on?
7900466	7902187	It's a dead mic, buddy.
7902207	7903768	We can't hear you on it.
7903848	7904769	That's our guest mic.
7904929	7906870	It just doesn't work anymore.
7907590	7910352	I said, holy shit, dude, that was funny as hell.
7910372	7911292	I'd never heard it before.
7912813	7913393	That's pretty good.
7913453	7916835	You know it's old, though, because it talks about Intern Zero on there.
7916855	7919117	That guy's been MIA for like a year and a half now, so...
7920706	7922746	What's going on in the sim scene this week, my friend?
7951915	7956098	Not a... Still, DDR Maniacs is down, gone.
7956778	7958359	Merry Christmas, it's not there anymore.
7960301	7966725	DDR UK, they're saying that the Ultramix 2 and Fusion stuff will be released when it's released.
7967086	7968227	That's the official word.
7969187	7974311	They were upgrading their servers, so I don't know what that means as far as release time.
7974758	7977679	But it's still out there, still in limbo, should be almost done.
7977799	7981381	I think they're just finishing up on basic, or not basic, the beginner steps.
7982281	7983502	And that's pretty much it.
7983902	7987204	Because now I guess there's beginner doubles, from what I've heard.
7989165	7989905	So they're doing that.
7990405	7994447	And other than that, there's some pretty good stuff on BomaniStyle right now.
7995735	8007881	Like I said, and I don't know why I do this, maybe as a service to the community or what, but I actually listen to every single Max remix that's submitted to Bomani.
8009322	8015645	And I'm afraid to say that nothing good has been recently submitted, sadly enough.
8015785	8017726	But there has been some good stuff.
8017906	8020067	I'm trying to remember who submitted it.
8020207	8020568	It was a...
8021940	8024662	There was a remix of Healing Vision that was actually pretty good.
8025083	8025903	It was like Healing Vision 2000.
8025943	8030747	And I can't remember who submitted that, but I'm looking that up right now.
8032649	8036352	Other than that, there was a few other sim files and a Stoic remix.
8037433	8039274	There was some other stuff.
8040775	8041396	What was it?
8041716	8046921	A... B4U remix, and that was okay.
8047581	8049062	But anyways, the guy I was talking about is...
8050643	8057026	Looks like Dokoro Rider, and he's got a bunch of cool sim files here, and you can go check them out.
8057386	8061888	You can actually, he's on the second or third page on there, and you'll see Healing Vision 2000.
8061928	8067110	You can just search under the author and pull up all of his files that he's made, and they're pretty good.
8068271	8077715	And then I was playing, I forget what other one, I think it was the last DDR Extreme UK release or something like that, or DDR...
8078993	8089816	I don't remember what it was, but anyways, it was, um, there were some videos, um, like, just, like, top 40 crap, and that was pretty cool, too, while I was playing those.
8090696	8093897	But, um, as far as anything major going on, nada.
8094277	8095777	Nothing from last week.
8096358	8096938	Nothing new.
8097918	8105480	Oh, I guess there's some stupid, uh, there's some contests going on for myself about Rizlam and making symbols for that in the remixes.
8106914	8109075	Yeah, but anyways, other than that, nothing.
8109735	8110255	Nothing else.
8111936	8117097	But definitely check out the sim files I recommended, and yeah, that's it.
8119738	8123680	Alrighty, well, sounds like the sim scene's kind of on vacation for Christmas there.
8123720	8126981	It's too bad about, I'm noticing a lot of Belmonte sites are down lately.
8127281	8129182	Jason was pointing a few out to me before the show.
8129222	8131262	They're GrooveStats, down.
8131382	8132423	DM Ashura, down.
8133363	8133503	So.
8134520	8135100	What can you do?
8135640	8136080	It happens.
8136180	8137121	Bandwidth kind of stinks.
8137841	8138401	Very interesting.
8138501	8145983	I'm surprised there are no official, or well, there isn't going to be official, but nobody has put together Ultramix 2 steps, files yet?
8146143	8146763	Nobody's done that?
8148644	8150244	DDRUK is on top of it.
8150504	8151704	They will be done soon.
8151724	8152785	I think they are done right now.
8152825	8156065	The problem with them is they have so many people working on submitting stuff.
8156646	8157926	They are like
8158666	8160787	Perfectionist when it comes to this stuff.
8160807	8162927	So they're not going to release it until it's perfect.
8163087	8166629	So, you know, that's good to know, but it will take a little longer to release.
8166789	8167149	That's all.
8168469	8173171	I remember, though, Loki, when DDR Max USA or something came out, you did a half-assed job.
8173191	8174091	It was pretty decent.
8174131	8175191	You had everything ripped.
8175211	8175752	You had the song.
8175772	8176392	You had the steps.
8176552	8177312	It worked for me.
8177752	8179893	You had it out within days.
8180733	8182614	But these guys, it's been a couple months now.
8183494	8185795	That's because I just don't give a damn anymore.
8186317	8188758	I could have had these out a couple days after it came out.
8189398	8195480	But I just don't give a damn because they have better ways of doing it now with Ultramix and on the Xbox.
8195720	8200181	There's actual ways they can rip the files straight from there.
8201481	8204302	So you get perfect music rips, perfect graphic rips.
8205622	8206963	I just am not interested anymore.
8207123	8211184	I don't really care about ripping files because I know someone will eventually do it.
8211484	8212624	And it's not a big deal to me.
8213085	8214305	I played them on the Xbox.
8215034	8216434	Whatever, I don't really care anymore.
8219875	8223216	Alright, well let's move on to the FUs of the week, shall we?
8223296	8225717	This is the part of the show where we get a little bit ranty.
8225737	8230598	And this is the part where I would ask Jamie, why is it that we do the FUs every week?
8230678	8236160	And she would say something like, because we're not going to take it anymore.
8243327	8243848	Oh, this is bad.
8243888	8245110	Here is just too bad.
8253231	8255373	Obviously, DarkSakura is not here tonight.
8255453	8256093	She's sick.
8256173	8257534	We hope she gets better soon.
8258054	8270102	So, on DarkSakura's behalf, I will give an FU to viruses and diseases that won't go away and things that ruin your Christmas season because you're sick.
8270363	8271383	Does that sound pretty fair?
8271784	8282251	Oh, and because DarkSakura usually has the FU to stupid drivers, FU to unruly children's parents, and FU to stupid people that call her at work.
8283015	8283756	That about wrap it up?
8283997	8284537	Sounds good to me.
8284577	8286040	Let's move on to Loki.
8289245	8289565	Okay.
8290427	8291088	First off...
8292506	8293847	I just wasn't winning today at all.
8293947	8296409	Then there's the people that don't fucking look where they're going.
8316986	8328273	and they just turn in front of you and they're like, oh, you hit me, that's your fault, I'm going, because I have my truck, and I support push, therefore I'm going.
8329954	8343762	I don't know, whatever, they're stupid, that and the stupid jaywalkers, they're like, oh, I almost got hit, well, you know, you should maybe cross the crosswalk, around a corner, maybe follow some traffic laws, yeah.
8345433	8348895	Um, fuck you to Folsom Police for not being where they need to be.
8349315	8368144	When I see all these people breaking the law as far as turning left on, you know, right turn only, you know, lanes and stuff like that, and they're fucking just never there, but oh, damn, sure, as soon as you start... Heaven forbid you run a stoplight in front of the Krispy Kreme.
8369265	8372106	Heaven forbid that happen, you know, then you're fucked.
8372864	8377252	But anyways, also, fuck you to the lack of pants.
8378013	8378935	I need more pants.
8379235	8381860	I'm running low on pants, and that makes me sad.
8381940	8384104	All I got this year for Christmas was shirts.
8384767	8386929	when I need pants to go with those shirts.
8387670	8390952	So, goddammit, no pants makes me sad.
8392093	8404824	And, um, also, fuck you to the lack of parties in Final Fantasy XI because I have to wait for hours at a time playing my, um, Mario 64 on my DS while waiting, you know, to get a party because it's taking forever.
8406105	8410089	And retarded people, because retarded people must play online games for some reason.
8410169	8411310	Somehow they make it through.
8411900	8417702	Much like society where, you know, some people somehow make it through our education system despite the fact they're retarded.
8419062	8421302	I guess we need someone to flip the burgers then, don't we?
8422903	8423443	Man, I'm all done.
8423463	8424163	I'm all done.
8424763	8425023	Yeah.
8425083	8425403	Yeah.
8434062	8438264	I'd like to put an F you out to the chair that collapsed under the weight of my own ass.
8438784	8441765	I'd like to put an F you out to Walmart for producing that chair.
8441805	8445927	I'd like to give you an F you to myself for shopping at Walmart when I purchased that chair.
8446767	8448428	I'd like to give an F you to Best Buy.
8448988	8452130	What the fuck kind of store doesn't have shopping carts when I need them?
8452650	8457792	I asked if I could have a shopping cart and they looked at me like I was a damn foreigner speaking another language.
8459881	8462022	I've seen shopping carts at Best Buys before.
8462162	8464724	Oh, I know why you don't have any shopping carts right now.
8465084	8467445	Because you're putting all your fucking clearance items in there.
8468005	8469206	You guys sell tables?
8469866	8474409	Put all the clearance items on a table and let me have the damn shopping cart.
8474469	8479171	Because of your ass, I had to carry that chair to Loki's car.
8479431	8480392	And that was not fair.
8481312	8508918	and also F you to the fact that there was nobody around willing to help me out so when I walked over to the other department I found another guy I said hey could you help me get this chair and he's just like uh well that's not my department let me see if I can find somebody who can help you so I went over to the other department my department is like about an inch away from where you're at you see if you look at the markings on the floor
8509758	8512562	This is the car stereo department in the blue area, okay?
8512662	8515547	And where you are, in the white area, that's home furnishings.
8515907	8518331	This is my department, and you're in that department, okay?
8518351	8520835	So I can't help you, even though I'm five feet away from you, okay?
8521395	8521876	Okay, sorry.
8522217	8522397	Sorry.
8523615	8527096	So I finally had to go over to the dishwasher area to get some guy to help me.
8527737	8536340	And he was kind enough to get up on the ladder, bring down the chair for me, and he even rung it up right there so I didn't have to stand in that atrocious line.
8536680	8539741	And the chair only cost half as much as we thought it would.
8539801	8540961	So thank you to that guy.
8541522	8549224	And unfortunately I did not catch the guy's name, but I will know him in the future because he's the only black guy I've ever seen working at a Best Buy.
8550485	8550665	Ever.
8555162	8560744	Also, I'd like to give an FU to the fact that I have to go back to work tomorrow, because that's no fair.
8561445	8569229	And I'd like to give an FU to Nintendo for putting out a DS before they had any really good games really available for it.
8569749	8571550	And FU to Ping Pals, because...
8572927	8578611	The following views are the expressed views of me, Dark Child, and are not at all endorsed by Orange Lounge Radio.
8603339	8605160	Fuck you to Daniel.
8606161	8608483	I don't know, you're not on these forums or nothing.
8608503	8610145	I don't think you listen, so I don't give a fuck.
8610345	8611205	Fuck you.
8611706	8616069	You know, you say you know what the fuck I'm going through and how the fuck you do this shit to someone.
8616650	8617651	Fuck you, man.
8618011	8619672	I fucking despise you.
8620173	8622154	You went after a woman who had a man.
8622535	8623375	Fuck you.
8624336	8629000	Fuck you to my mother for giving me a shitty ass gift.
8629020	8630361	You know, she gave me calling cards.
8630933	8636056	Because I racked up a phone bill with my girlfriend a month ago, you know, about $600 to $800 phone bill.
8636577	8638017	So I get calling cards for Christmas.
8638638	8641260	She bought them three days after my girlfriend broke up with me.
8641440	8642660	So, uh, fuck you, mom.
8642981	8643521	Nice gift.
8644642	8659531	Fuck you to some stupid ass on FilePlanet who posted up my friend's GTA San Andreas, or GTA Vice City video, as though it was GTA San Andreas video made in Legos, and taking credit for doing it himself instead of my friend doing it.
8660728	8666910	and also fuck you to FilePlanet because that video was posted and now BrickFlick.com has gone over bandwidth so I can't even check that site out.
8668130	8671871	And finally, fuck you to the turn of events that have occurred in my life.
8672752	8677793	I thought I had more time to change things, apparently I don't, so fuck you to life in general.
8678353	8678753	That's all.
8679193	8679834	Have a nice day.
8681694	8684455	Alrighty, let's move on then to the chatroom FUs.
8687249	8699781	Ah, DDR Angel says, F you to having no internet from Wednesday to Saturday, F you to being sicker than hell on Christmas, and F you to not being able to spend time with my friends on Christmas, but I was with you all in spirit.
8704185	8704785	Sorry, hairball.
8706867	8710371	Outphase would like to say, fuck you to DDR Extreme USA.
8713940	8718509	Dark Knight says, F you to too much damn Christmas movies all week long.
8718950	8721034	I mean, I'm tired of a Christmas story.
8721054	8721495	24 hours.
8721535	8721736	Damn.
8724724	8725644	You know what, I agree.
8726025	8731407	A Christmas Story, one of the greatest Christmas, if not movies, but Christmas movies of all time.
8731767	8735749	We used to watch it every Christmas Eve, but god damn has that movie been played out.
8736389	8742912	It's time for them to make a sequel or a remake or do a new Christmas movie that we can all relate to with a dysfunctional family.
8745654	8752097	Jaded2004 says, F you to the person who wished for a white Christmas, cause we got two feet of snow.
8754438	8760142	And DJ Ranma S says, A giant F you to the fuckhead that tried to kick my ass at work.
8760222	8763284	Ha ha ha, sucks to be you, cause your ass is behind bars.
8763644	8766887	By the way, from this Best Buy employee, fuck you all.
8767087	8767427	Smirk.
8768848	8769128	Jerk.
8771926	8773347	Alright, that's it.
8773587	8775007	Pretty short on the FUs tonight.
8775507	8777648	Oh, there might be a couple more.
8778028	8778749	Actually, I don't think so.
8778769	8780729	I think that's about it.
8783050	8788252	Oh, no, Outphase wanted to add a fuck you to DDR Freak for no good reason, apparently.
8788452	8789753	So just a general FU.
8789793	8790933	I guess he was banned, I don't know.
8791953	8795975	Then I'll just add a for no reason a fuck you to Jason Coe, and I don't know why.
8797625	8800065	Aren't you kind and generous and full of love?
8800285	8803406	You know this show is played on DDR Freak occasionally?
8803666	8806647	Isn't that kind of shooting us in the foot there, you dumbass?
8807427	8809507	I gave a disclaimer about my statements already.
8813288	8813588	Loki?
8816628	8824770	There's a new quest in Final Fantasy XI that they just started after the Christen event ended with goblins that ride chocobos.
8826010	8826990	Who cares? !
8829614	8833278	Alright, BigRedPimp has a late FU that I'm just now getting.
8833879	8839585	FU to Nintendo for making the DS $20 more than how much money I got for Christmas.
8839825	8840426	Oh, that's too bad.
8840506	8843429	Sucks to be you.
8843509	8844850	Now I'm getting all these FUs.
8844870	8845631	You guys are late.
8845771	8846492	You're tardy.
8847153	8847973	Sign in, please.
8848334	8851557	Misty says I can't be in an FU mood because I got to play in the group today.
8852523	8856744	and Outface says there was no reason behind his FU to DDR Freak.
8856764	8857464	He's just bored.
8858305	8863086	And I know when I'm bored, I just sit here and think to myself, God, fuck DDR Freak.
8863126	8864746	I mean, they ruined my life.
8870328	8870768	I don't get it.
8871268	8871868	Dark Child.
8873889	8874949	I understand, you know.
8875429	8877630	I just throw out fuck you's to random people at times.
8878830	8879811	Shut the fuck up!
8880431	8881251	Fuck you, Rob.
8884028	8886030	I'm just saying fuck on the radio because I can.
8888872	8891053	On that note, I think it's a very good time to go to a break.
8891073	8891754	What do you guys think?
8893584	8894545	You guys don't fucking care.
8894605	8895726	Alright, we're going to go to a break.
8896147	8900972	When we come back, more randomness here on Orange Lounge Radio.
8901372	8907018	In this break, since I think it seems appropriate, we're going to do some music from DDR Extreme USA.
8907078	8907779	How's that sound?
8907939	8908480	Tee hee.
8910422	8911783	And we'll be back after this.
8912684	8913325	A bit of music.
8913405	8913745	Enjoy.
8913765	8915227	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
9011428	9012589	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9036759	9049140	Love, real love, love, love, love, simply be love, love, love, love, love, love, simply be
9059617	9088505	Simply be in love, yeah, yeah Simply be in love, yeah, yeah Simply be in love, yeah, yeah Simply be in love, yeah Simply be in love, yeah Simply be in love It's more than enough Simply be in love It's more than enough
9090959	9103589	Simply enough, is more than enough, yeah You touched my body once, it burned
9172879	9177603	Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music
9200043	9201570	We are back here on Orange Launch Radio.
9201590	9203598	We've got about a half hour of show left to kill here.
9205108	9205869	What are we going to do?
9234988	9236690	Show up and support Orange Lounge Radio.
9236750	9237150	It happens.
9238671	9240853	What kind of stuff are you looking at over there, Loki?
9240913	9246057	I noticed you were reading something about... Now, this has nothing to do with Bomani, but a lot of people say ZSNes.
9247318	9253843	Oh, the first release in two and a half years for ZSNes has been released with a bunch of, like, fixes and crap.
9253863	9254964	So I was just checking that out.
9255225	9257566	I was just reading Slashdot, because that's what I do.
9258007	9258908	And they have an article.
9258928	9263131	They had one that's at the very bottom of the page, actually, that's about overclocking a Nintendo...
9267094	9269215	Yes, you can overclock an NES.
9269956	9271957	Why the fuck would you want to overclock an NES?
9272177	9273758	You know, an NES is beyond me.
9274679	9277760	They did mention, though, there are some games, though, that lagged out normally.
9278421	9279722	You can play them without lag now.
9280102	9281823	But other games just fuck up.
9282637	9286359	But that was the best part about the Nintendo system, was the games that glitched out.
9286719	9291781	We would get games dirty just to play them so they would glitch out, and it's like a whole new challenge.
9292281	9299944	Akari Warriors, man, so many hours of entertainment played, you know, just from that game glitching out.
9300444	9305306	Oh, hey, look, Player One just fell behind the backdrop, now he's running underneath everything.
9306767	9309408	It was so much fun, it was just crazy.
9310788	9313349	Why didn't you just start putting random codes in the game, Genie?
9316209	9317509	I did that with Ninja Gaiden.
9318049	9318870	It was cool.
9318910	9321550	The game worked fine when I was running and shooting ninja stars and stuff.
9322030	9328652	But the moment I jumped, I went under the stage and somehow flew to the end of the stage, but still under the ground.
9330312	9333012	There's just so much shit that's glitched out.
9333032	9334133	Those are the days.
9335673	9340194	Now we have these new games that don't glitch... Well, okay, I can't say they don't glitch out that much.
9340274	9340474	I mean...
9341135	9341515	Driver 3.
9341555	9343015	That's enough said.
9343035	9344536	That game is so awful.
9345996	9347877	I need to play some Driver 3 tonight.
9348077	9348937	I've decided.
9349177	9355578	I've got to go back and play that game just because it's so bad and so glitchy that it's worth it.
9357699	9358999	Oh, and there's another thing here.
9359099	9361800	You know how they have all those free iPod links?
9362907	9364168	I'm really curious about this article.
9364208	9365048	I'm looking on Slashdot.
9365068	9369971	I'm actually clicking on it, trying to find out more about what's going on here because I know this is a big thing going on right now.
9369991	9372693	And on all the DDR sites, you see it in people's signatures.
9373233	9375255	Win a free iPod.
9375555	9379117	Or not win, but sign up for this crap and get a free iPod.
9379157	9380358	Sign up for this and that and get a free iPod.
9380798	9382319	But it's actually worked.
9382459	9388263	We know people that have gotten free iPods because of it, so you can't deny that the system works.
9388803	9391785	I'm kind of wondering what I'm seeing here on Slashdot about.
9391885	9392385	What is this?
9392406	9393927	They're saying there's fine print or something.
9393947	9395608	Are they going to have to give the iPods back?
9396208	9396688	What's going on?
9396728	9399030	Are they going to charge credit card unknowingly or something?
9399070	9399870	What's going on?
9399911	9400991	No, I'm making that stuff up.
9401472	9402632	But I'm kind of curious.
9403233	9405294	What's the hidden message here on the iPod thing?
9405714	9409577	Now, granted, I myself, I wanted an iPod.
9409657	9410738	I just ended up buying one.
9410758	9412079	It was a Christmas present to myself.
9412539	9416642	Whereas I probably could have done the refer six friends and get one thing.
9419084	9421146	I get nervous about that kind of stuff
9438149	9440030	It's just too good to be true.
9440110	9440530	You know what I mean?
9440550	9441890	It's just too damn good to be true.
9441910	9443331	There's got to be something hidden.
9443731	9450833	And even though I have no right to think that because I know people that have done this and have gotten away with it, I just... What the hell?
9452353	9452873	Any thoughts, Loki?
9452893	9454313	Have you been able to find anything on this?
9456674	9456894	No.
9457174	9457774	I don't really care.
9457914	9458595	I don't do these.
9458775	9462136	I don't, you know... I just don't buy this stuff.
9462536	9463776	And I really, you know...
9465424	9465744	Free money?
9482506	9482986	Free money!
9483246	9484567	Free money for doing this iPhone thing.
9484847	9491691	In fact, this person right here was just saying on this one link that they had on there, that was saying, just wanted to add one more thing.
9491831	9493091	I got off the phone with my girlfriend.
9493111	9497894	She received a $500 gift card from IRC a few days ago.
9498134	9500115	Now she's $550 richer.
9500575	9508899	I think I can say with absolute certainty that the Incentive Rewards Center is both legitimate and attentive to their customers.
9508919	9509840	I don't know what the fuck the...
9510620	9531268	The, um, whatever, the IRC Incentive Rewards Center, whatever But, um, I don't know, whatever, I mean If you want to go ahead and risk it and try to get free shit, just know for a fact And this is pure economics, nothing in life is free
9533120	9543083	Does it say in the small print, like somebody's suggesting in the chatroom here, I think it's Moo in the chatroom right now, says, I think people are unknowingly selling their souls for those free iPods.
9543163	9545724	Is there something in the small print about having to give up your soul?
9546424	9547684	Because seriously, where are they?
9547824	9549785	I mean, I understand where they're making the money.
9549805	9556787	They're making their money off the people that can only refer four friends and can't get that fifth friend, as frustrating as it must be to them or whatever.
9557167	9561168	That's where they're making their money, but I don't know.
9562449	9567275	What I think it is, is they're not paying some kind of research firm to give them a bunch of email addresses.
9567796	9571180	Instead, it's much cheaper than just give out iPods to get the email addresses.
9572745	9575047	But everybody's giving a fake email address.
9575688	9578670	Everybody I know who's done this hasn't used their real email address.
9579251	9582553	So, you know, I don't know.
9583754	9584976	Weird, weird stuff.
9585776	9593343	Alright, well, maybe one day I'll participate in one of these Get Rich Quick schemes for the sake of the show, and I'll let you know how it goes.
9593803	9600429	It's kind of funny though, we're having all this chatting about iPods because of something that I'm not going to talk about right now.
9601069	9605854	But it's just interesting that we're having all this talk about iPods.
9605874	9607015	Yes, it was creative foreshadowing.
9607855	9610838	Alright, now people think we're going to be giving away iPods.
9610938	9613220	No, sorry, we don't have the budget for that, sorry.
9614721	9617644	Why would we subject you to those horrible devices?
9619142	9621483	I have an iPod, and I like my iPod.
9621683	9622323	It's cool.
9623343	9632625	It does bang up a little easy, though, because you'll notice now, granted, I don't have a protective case or anything, and I do take this to my car with me, but you'll notice there's already little scratches that are showing up on the screen, and look at this.
9632985	9633325	Look at this.
9633925	9640307	Right there, where the dot meets the wheel there, a little bit of stripping there of the cheap plastic.
9642147	9644168	iPods are like Korean whores to me.
9644208	9645648	I'm not touching them because they're dirty!
9650993	9651293	Wow.
9653653	9654174	You know what though?
9654274	9660455	I figure that now the chat room is all teasing me because I went and bought an iPod and I could have gotten a free one.
9660495	9661115	But you know what?
9661635	9669836	It felt good to walk into the Apple store and walk in there and lay my credit card down and go, Daddy wants an iPod today.
9670556	9674757	Can you gift wrap it for me so I can take it home and open it up and make it feel like it's Christmas?
9678678	9678978	I don't know.
9680902	9685185	Now we've started this war about all these other multimedia devices that are supposedly better than iPods.
9685566	9685986	You know what?
9686006	9686586	That's great.
9686667	9687607	That's just fabulous.
9687647	9688748	Have fun with your devices.
9689008	9691470	I am more than happy with my freaking iPod.
9691530	9691950	Thank you.
9692931	9693872	You know what rocks?
9694292	9695493	It's the greatest thing ever.
9695573	9697094	It's called an MP3C player.
9697474	9705120	Okay, you put it in your car, and you can burn MP3s to a disc, and you can play like hours and hours of stuff.
9705440	9706000	And guess what?
9706040	9706941	They only cost like $20!
9709608	9710928	Don't buy the iPod.
9711028	9713509	Do not subject yourself to something that looks cute.
9714269	9716210	Cuteness does not mean functional.
9717290	9719831	I need to interrupt here for a minute.
9720251	9722472	I had the MP3 CD player in my car.
9722552	9724572	It worked for a week, and then it didn't work anymore.
9725113	9727213	That's why they're so cheap, because they don't fucking work.
9727473	9735896	And you burn them, and then they skip all the time because you have them sitting on the seat, or wherever I would stick that thing, it would skip, skip, skip, skip, because MP3 CDs just... Bullshit!
9735976	9736936	No, you're bullshit!
9738117	9740718	Those CD players have like a two-minute skip time.
9740738	9743879	You'd have to literally throw it out of a plane for it to skip.
9744900	9748581	Hey, speaking of iPods, did they ever fix the battery problem with the iPods?
9748621	9754044	Because if not, you're going to get like 16 months use out of it, and you're screwed.
9754084	9754544	You're fucked.
9755684	9763488	Supposedly, yes, they fixed the battery problem with the iPods, but this is why I bought my iPod at the official Apple store, so that if anything goes wrong with it, I will take it back and demand a new one.
9763888	9766109	But the battery life, it could be better.
9766129	9766169	Ah!
9767290	9779617	Well, seeing as the dude's got the official response from Apple's customer service saying that he had to purchase a brand new one or a refurbed one because they don't have replacement batteries and they won't replace them, I don't think buying it from the Apple store will matter.
9781819	9784240	No, from what I understand, they do the replacement battery thing now.
9784480	9785861	They do that.
9786101	9790744	And I know that they, I asked about it and they said that they sell the batteries or something like that now.
9791444	9792645	So, suck it.
9795356	9800139	Big old untrue rumor for 2005 DDR game coming to the N-Gage.
9800380	9802801	Oh, N-Gage best-selling game system ever also.
9803242	9803842	Just so you know.
9804082	9804462	What?
9807485	9808185	I said untrue.
9810026	9813389	Is somebody actually proclaiming this, that N-Gage is best-selling system ever?
9814910	9815150	No.
9815570	9816411	What's that dumb?
9817972	9821675	I was going to say, tell me who they are so I can point and laugh at them appropriately, please.
9821755	9822135	Thank you.
9825271	9825591	All right.
9827292	9830113	Um... You know what?
9831153	9833013	I'm thinking we ought to just end the damn show.
9833994	9834774	You want to play music?
9834994	9835854	What music do you want to play?
9837255	9841116	I'll just play some of those remixes that I downloaded earlier.
9841716	9842476	Because they're cool.
9843737	9843997	Anyways.
9845217	9849679	Um, some of the songs I was telling you about, you know, earlier, the sim files and whatnot.
9850459	9851799	Um, some cool shit that's out there.
9852500	9853540	Um, let's see...
9855072	9861818	Well, we've got... Healing Vision 2000, which is pretty good.
9862218	9862619	Pretty good.
9862799	9872147	I don't know if this is the actual name for it, because this guy, DokuRider or whatever, he does take a lot of songs, though, that are not his, and renames them, but makes sim files for them.
9872247	9876330	I think he's foreign, so he doesn't know what the names of the songs are, so he just kind of makes one up.
9877071	9880494	But anyways, you might be finding them on online file sharing sites.
9881435	9881635	But...
9882537	9887710	Anyways, we're going to start off with Healing Vision 2000, and I'll try that one, so it's pretty cool.
9916041	9916762	Thanks for watching!
9940306	9941207	Thanks for watching!
9966420	9967822	Thanks for watching!
10005663	10006586	Thanks for watching!
10017165	10018426	That was pretty cool.
10019886	10023928	Now, some other things I just, you know, listening to that reminded me.
10023988	10027970	I forgot to mention the new stuff coming to you from Diverse Systems.
10028311	10030252	And there's a lot of stuff actually to mention.
10031252	10034013	Four new albums were announced this week.
10034914	10038576	Starting off with D8, which is the brand new Diversisms album.
10039156	10040797	Album on your remixes, two to set.
10041557	10043098	That should be coming out pretty soon.
10043118	10044919	And we're actually going to play some of those.
10045940	10052227	I haven't listened to these new ones though that we're going to play, so it should be interesting.
10052267	10057692	This first one is an Ecstasy remix called, let's see here, what was the title?
10057813	10062418	It was Ecstasy Fly Air Heaven is the name of that.
10063058	10066262	So I'll have to check this one out real quick here, let's see.
10125305	10126065	Dear Mr. Taka, Dear Mr. Desire,
10152936	10155697	So it should be pretty good, all talking music I would assume.
10156477	10162538	A new one also they're going to be working on, which is Diverse vs. Capcom, which should be pretty sweet.
10163399	10169380	All remixes of your favorite side-scroller fighters.
10170240	10175982	And then also there's another title they announced, which is...
10177031	10180833	Fujitsu, which I believe is actually just one of the artists.
10181773	10184235	The guy that did the remix of the Safari.
10185315	10187697	Remember that one that's in Food Mix?
10188077	10188717	He did that.
10191158	10191599	Oh, God.
10193680	10194920	Well, we have to listen to this.
10196161	10201243	We'll listen to this next, but it's one of Rob's nightmares come alive.
10201304	10202124	Jesus, what?
10206297	10210380	So anyways, the next one, like I said, Gentle Stress.
10210520	10210721	So...
10243873	10258217	Okay, but the creme de la creme of the Fujitsu one, we teased about this last week, I believe, maybe even worse than that, when Rob was mentioning, God, I hate those stupid sim files, you know, they're a cross between songs.
10258877	10261597	Well, this one, max 321 stars.
10262798	10264618	Sadly enough, it was made.
10294347	10295768	Go a little further into the file here.
10295809	10296609	Let's hear a different part.
10307460	10309241	It just has that back beat running through the whole thing.
10312805	10313425	Finding another part?
10313565	10313946	Was that it?
10313966	10315187	I think that was it.
10320000	10321422	Some things just shouldn't be done.
10321483	10329455	I don't care if it's by a really great Japanese remixing group, and I'm sure the guy's done some other really good files, but, uh... Jeez!
10330437	10330918	Alright, what's this?
10332661	10333642	This is some other stuff.
10333702	10334803	I don't really know what this is.
10334823	10338025	Love is Eternity, Original Extended Mix.
10338125	10339466	Yeah, it is a Chorus K album.
10339486	10341947	They're also going to be distributing the Chorus K album, looks like.
10342848	10346610	So, yeah, lots of good stuff coming to you from Diverse Systems.
10346730	10352514	Unfortunately, they have not updated their goddamn English page, so we can't order any of this unless you're in Japan.
10352554	10353735	That fucking sucks.
10354315	10356717	But that's the way life goes, I guess.
10357301	10358823	Thank you very much for tuning in tonight.
10358883	10364128	We're going to go around and get... Oh, yeah, DarkShadow, do you have another thought here?
10382279	10387041	Once again, anyone who could offer me advice, email address dchild999 at yahoo.com.
10387101	10391363	That's d-c-h-y-l-d-e-9-9-9 at yahoo.com.
10392464	10400387	And if you forget that address, just go give a shout out on the forums and Dark Child will find you and take you under his wing and breastfeed you.
10400527	10401628	No, I'm just kidding.
10402308	10402568	All right.
10404309	10404649	All right.
10405150	10407711	Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts of the day.
10408811	10410392	Dark Child, your final thoughts.
10412967	10421530	die Daniel, die Loki, your final thought I'm full and tired
10424554	10428516	And my final thought is, I don't care if it's a few minutes early, we're spent.
10428776	10430197	So, good night everybody.
10430277	10435139	The final word of the show, one word to sum it all up.
10436120	10439962	We're going to give, as soon as I queue up the actual outro to the show, which would be a good idea.
10440722	10446145	The final word of the show that will sum it all up, we're going to give it to the one, the only, DarkSakura.
10447165	10450247	So think of one word that's going to sum it all up for you and the show.
10451588	10458634	But also we do hope, DarkSakura, if you're out there listening somewhere, although you might be asleep by now, I don't know, hope you feel better.
10458994	10459775	Feel better soon.
10459795	10462657	The show just isn't the same without you, trust me.
10463297	10482485	and we'll see you guys next week hopefully DarkSakura will be back and we'll have plenty of New Year's Eve stories to be telling you guys be safe this New Year's have a great rest of your 2004 you guys and we'll see you in 2005 and now with the final word of the day Dark Child Chance
10484251	10487072	And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.
10509679	10514842	Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sensimia Street?
10515242	10518204	How to get to Sensimia Street?
10518564	10522727	How to get to Sensimia Street?
10522807	10527670	Hello, Kermit the Frog here, and welcome to Sensimia Street.
10529251	10534954	I'd like to tell you what today's letter is, but I am really f***ed up.
10536567	10539128	Hey, Big Bird, do you know what today's letter is?
10539589	10540969	Sure, Kermit.
10541389	10545931	Today's letter is... Joint.
10547492	10551194	Uh, Big Bird, joint is not a letter.
10553494	10554235	It is a word.
10555055	10556036	Sorry, kids.
10556676	10559677	Today's letter is three.
10559897	10561438	Hmm, Big Bird, uh...
10562921	10564262	Three is a number.
10565263	10566184	Exactly.
10566764	10571308	The number three, which is how many joints I've smoked today.
10573790	10576312	Kermit, are you with me?
10576332	10579675	Thank God I'm stoned.
10580729	10581990	Me too.
10583671	10587393	Guys, guys, show go on.
10587573	10588893	Come on.
10589193	10590794	Thank you, Elmo.
10591575	10594476	How about we say our ABCs, Big Bird?
10595417	10596497	Okay.
10597798	10603601	A, B, C, D, E, F, R, G, Q, K, C, R, Z, F,
10611707	10614268	I forgot what we were doing, Kramit.
10615668	10617589	Did you just call me Kramit?
10618049	10619189	Yes, I did.
10620270	10621570	Kramity Frog here.
10622410	10626452	Okay, okay.
10627232	10629333	That's all the time we have for today.
10630153	10630873	Goodbye, kids.
10631153	10635535	Today's show was brought to you by the letter... Bong.
10635555	10637135	And the number...
10641129	10647272	Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
10695163	10702330	Orange Lounge Radio Afterbirth, the part after the credits have faded to black and we're still here wanting attention from you guys.
10702631	10703111	You know what?
10703932	10708316	We literally only had not even half the usual listeners that we've had.
10708717	10714142	I swear to God, we better start seeing an increase in people coming back to the station or we're quitting.
10714883	10715764	It's quitting time.
10717512	10718653	I'm just making empty threats.
10718713	10719974	I don't know what we can do about it.
10720194	10721595	I guess just because it's the holidays.
10721655	10725058	But man, that was a sad turnout tonight, you guys.
10726219	10727740	Cry, cry, cry.
10727880	10729201	I'm very upset with you all.
10731343	10735005	Loki, any final post-credit things you wanted to get out?
10737707	10738348	No.
10738948	10739729	I'm tired.
10740549	10741590	I just feel drained.
10742431	10743211	All that food.
10743232	10745193	I don't know.
10746654	10752016	9.30.
10746874	10752016	That's three and a half hours of party time.
10752056	10753077	That's what I thought.
10753957	10754317	Addict.
10755318	10757178	Although I'm thinking very similar thoughts here.
10757479	10762161	But yeah, I've just eaten so much I just want to curl into the bed and take a big fat cat nap.
10762421	10763321	Emphasis on fat.
10764561	10769043	I got new flannel sheets for Christmas and they're comfy.
10769524	10770824	They're very comfy.
10773545	10775446	Your flat lice made me sleepy.
10777213	10792219	Mine too, and I don't know, all that's in it, okay, that's in my fried rice is just, you know, rice, obviously, steamed rice, egg, lots of garlic, lots of butter, lots of soy sauce, and pork.
10794419	10796660	I don't know which one of those made me tired.
10797941	10798581	That was pork?
10799561	10800202	I don't eat pork.
10801122	10801482	Oh well.
10802783	10803063	Don't!
10803083	10806584	At least I'm not Muslim, so I'm not going to hell.
10808214	10809435	Oh well, it was tasty pork.
10811998	10813660	So yeah, I don't know.
10814280	10815662	I fucking hate my printer.
10816222	10822769	I have to get new cartridges for it and they're so tiny that they run out in like an hour and they're like 20 bucks each.
10823890	10828375	I tried to print on your printer yesterday and it wouldn't work so I just said fuck it because I bought tickets on Fandango.
10829639	10831600	For one, you don't need to bring the ticket thing.
10831900	10838583	Two, it's not hooked up to my computer anymore because I unplugged it for the extra long USB cable that was plugged in this God knows what else.
10839403	10840224	I don't know, something else.
10840964	10843605	And, um... Antidote bank, anyways.
10843685	10845186	So, you're screwed three times.
10848147	10848807	Well, shit.
10849208	10851609	I need to play more Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.
10851969	10853269	I need to play more DDR.
10853309	10854750	I need to play anything in general.
10856231	10859212	My friend and I beat San Andreas within three days with, uh,
10859879	10863081	40 hours and then we beat it 100% three days later.
10865943	10866583	I'm cheating.
10867464	10868164	The entire way.
10869765	10873067	It makes it so much, you know, so much better.
10873707	10875648	And have you ever been on a motorcycle?
10875848	10876449	I kid you not.
10876769	10877649	This happened to me twice.
10877830	10881412	I was on a motorcycle driving through the country and a plane crashes into me!
10882432	10883673	Oh yeah, yeah, that happens all the time.
10883753	10888836	We had walked out of one of our casinos in Vegas and a plane just flew right into the side of the building right next to the door.
10889428	10889948	It's pretty cool.
10890308	10893850	Now what you need to try is get into the two-player mode and start a kiss.
10894451	10898913	Have the first player kiss player two, and player two then hit triangle to get in the vehicle.
10899473	10900714	And then just watch what happens.
10901194	10904816	There are a lot of messed up glitches in that game, and that's one of the craziest.
10906116	10911179	Or the one where you can actually cut the other person's head off, and then they're just running headless throughout the whole game.
10912280	10916141	Or go ride the mountain bike off the top of the...
10917611	10925857	mount with a parachute to get that out or you could just hold your brake and pedal with the mountain bike and suddenly you get sucked into the middle of the world.
10928219	10929160	I love games.
10929200	10929880	They're glitchy.
10929900	10930961	Those are the best ones.
10932642	10946072	The new one that I found out was when you could fly into the other world where all the rooms exist, you gotta go into a gym and use the rocket pack code, kill everyone in the gym, go into a dark corner of the gym and fly straight up
10946837	10960023	and there'll be a yellow marker to the south of you and you can go into that and then suddenly you're in the tattoo parlor that should be in San André or San Piero that's not so you can get the third set of tattoos and then you can go to all the other interiors in the game.
10961544	10962184	Sweet.
10963185	10964045	Alright, I think that's enough.
10966706	10967087	I agree.
10967127	10968307	I'm falling asleep over here.
10968427	10969888	So have a great night everybody.
10970508	10972449	Thank you very much to those of you guys that tuned in tonight.
10972489	10973590	We do appreciate your support.
10973650	10975791	Please continue to support Orange Launch Radio.
