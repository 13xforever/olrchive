No out of population

45
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:34,260

00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:41,260

How you feeling, baby?

54
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:44,820
And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of

55
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,180
the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.

56
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:52,860
Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bamani Music and More program.

57
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,080
Can we talk about that?

58
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,100
No subject will ever be taboo.

59
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:00,100
Well, I was thinking maybe we should move, pump up the volume from Tuesday nights?

60
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,100
Except, of course, the subject that was just under discussion.

61
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:09,100
Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?

62
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,100
I collect your fucking head.

63
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,100
Just like this fucker here.

64
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,100
Oh my God, why did you do that to Loki?

65
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:23,100
The Hawk thing on Episode 69 was just a joke!

66
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:30,100
Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, NOW'S THE FUCKING TIME!

67
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:35,100
Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.

68
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,100
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

69
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:46,100
The lovely and wonderful Jamie there in that promo. Well, sorta.

70
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:28,220
Ash

71
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,220
NOW IS THE FUCKING TIME!

72
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:01,540
You remember way back during the first year of this program when somebody had talked about,

73
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:05,940
I want to say it was Dark Tetsuya was somehow involved with this, brought up the casting

74
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:10,820
of the Orange Lounge movie, and they took votes in the chat room and they said that

75
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,100
you should be played by Lucy Liu.

76
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,100
How ironic.

77
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,300
Which is, yeah, how ironic.

78
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,380
A little too ironic.

79
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,980
Especially considering you're not Asian at all.

80
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:25,340
No, but you know what, I finally got something new when I went to Alabama.

81
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:31,980
would be like me being played by Denzel Washington. That's funny. Anyway, sorry. Yes, Alabama.

82
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:38,260
I got, I believe it was, I thought you were taller. Alright, this is a good take away.

83
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:41,100
We've got to get into how was your week, how was your day, because I've got to figure out

84
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:45,980
about what this is all about. So, Jamie, how was your week, how was your day? My couple

85
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:52,740
of weeks were pretty decent. Very, very, very, very, very, very busy. Let's see, with my

86
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:58,580
On my trip to Alabama, I got there, my mom got us lost in the way from New Orleans.

87
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,860
We ended up heading up toward Hattiesburg.

88
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,820
There's something stuck in this thing.

89
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:07,980
Anyway, we ended up going up to Hattiesburg, and then right when mom realized where we

90
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:12,180
were, we had to go around a different way, so we headed home.

91
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:15,300
Got there, I didn't get in until six in the morning central.

92
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:21,660
That means I had been up an official 24 hours because I woke up at four Pacific in the morning.

93
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,820
My house crashed.

94
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:29,940
Next day was Thanksgiving, but we didn't do Thanksgiving stuff, we just slept.

95
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:36,180
And did some hanging out, you know, it was pretty cool.

96
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:41,580
Then on Friday I went to Dozen, saw my daddy, my uncle Dale.

97
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,340
My uncle Dale and my daddy are having their second childhoods.

98
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:49,720
My uncle Dale has a- AKA midlife crisis- 2004 Mustang GT.

99
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,880
My daddy has a Camaro.

100
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:58,160
My daddy is cute on the internet because they have this old 500 megahertz kind of crappy

101
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,160
thing.

102
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:05,060
My daddy is so cute playing on it because he just hunts and pecks with his little keys

103
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,060
and it's so cute.

104
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:12,880
And my daddy sends me everything in 72-point font in email.

105
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,880
It's adorable.

106
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,280
I used to be that way on AOL Instant Messenger.

107
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:20,840
I would type to everybody in a huge 72-point font, and they'd be like, knock it off!

108
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:25,840
But I figured my chats are very important, and I want to make sure that they're not missed.

109
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:34,840
Well, so Saturday, we had our official Thanksgiving at my uncle's house, and we had fried turkey.

110
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,840
Mmm.

111
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,840
Isn't that deep-fried turkey?

112
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,840
Deep-fried turkey.

113
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,400
You know how dangerous that shit is to make?

114
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,400
Oh, but it's so young.

115
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:47,600
My uncle had a very nice deep fryer with a lid and everything, and it was very gummy

116
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,840
because it makes all of the meat just super juicy and had all kinds of things that I'm

117
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,840
not supposed to eat.

118
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:57,440
Along the way to Dawson, though, I had boiled peanuts, and I passed by two movie galleries

119
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:08,000
and saluted them for you, Loki, like the single finger salute, but I had a really good time.

120
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:18,880
And then that night, I went to Ground Zero, which is a comic book store with gaming tables.

121
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,680
There were lots of people playing Yu-Gi-Oh!, and I felt really nerdy.

122
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,040
And then, but downstairs, there's like an arcade there.

123
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,040
It was pretty cool.

124
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,080
That's a very strange name for an arcade, in light of recent events.

125
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,200
Isn't it great?

126
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,200
Okay.

127
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:50,840
But there was a DDR Extreme, there was a Fourth Solo, there was a Virtual On, I played the

128
00:13:50,840 --> 00:14:02,200
hell out of Virtual On, and a Super Pac-Man, and I had a DS Maniacs, and a BeatMania 6

129
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:09,840
It was a little bit of a Bahmani hotbed for the area, and this was in what town again?

130
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,840
In Mobile.

131
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,840
In Mobile.

132
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,840
Wow, okay.

133
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,480
For anyone living near Mobile, Alabama, it's off of Moffat Road.

134
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,840
Way the fuck out there on Moffat Road.

135
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:20,700
I would imagine anyone listening to this show in Mobile, Alabama, probably knows of that

136
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,700
place already.

137
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,700
I met Dork.

138
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,700
Did you?

139
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,700
Yes.

140
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,700
One of our listeners.

141
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,700
I met quite a few people.

142
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,700
Actually, I met the...

143
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,400
I'm supposing that he's in charge of the machines there.

144
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:34,720
He goes by Pyramus Online, very very cool guy.

145
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,160
I went to a Bamani party!

146
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,160
What?

147
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,600
You went to a Bamani party?

148
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,600
Yeah.

149
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,640
You just randomly got invited to a Bamani party down there?

150
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:47,160
They were all heading over so I went over and played Ace Style on a wide screen TV and

151
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,160
that was rad.

152
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,160
Very nice.

153
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:52,360
So you just, you went over to strangers houses to play video games?

154
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,800
Yeah, I actually lived about a block away from where my ex-remates lived.

155
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,800
Huh.

156
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,520
So it was very close.

157
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:06,240
And I went over, of course, to hang out with my mama's son and my papa's son, and K. Kitty

158
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,940
and Bobby, and we had a pretty good time.

159
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:10,940
We watched movies.

160
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:17,580
I saw The End of the Day After Tomorrow, and no offense, but that movie sucks.

161
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,580
I don't think so.

162
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,580
That's my very professional opinion.

163
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:23,480
I don't know a lot of people who are going to disagree with you there.

164
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,480
My mom loves the movie.

165
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,480
They love the movie.

166
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,380
I don't really want to put down anyone else's opinion of it, but my opinion of it is crap.

167
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:38,500
We also, I learned the fine art of DVD duplication.

168
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,420
And so I was able to deliver a copy of Kill Bill volume two.

169
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,420
Orange is not afraid of it.

170
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,420
It's not advocate piracy.

171
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,420
Yes, he did.

172
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:52,380
And I got, actually, you know, there's that show, Kindred be Embraced, that came on based

173
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:56,100
off of the White Wolf universe, and I have all the episodes they ever made of that, because

174
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,680
I think that the actor died.

175
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,880
main guy who's playing the prince

176
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,080
but um... i have all of that i still have it on my uh...

177
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,920
if anyone brings me dvds you'll get copies

178
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,320
um...

179
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,520
orange on twitter does not advocate piracy

180
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,640
it's actually no they're not

181
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,960
i'm just teasing

182
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,120
they're not licensed for any more i want to find out more about this bromani party because

183
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,860
basically you went over to a stranger's house

184
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:26,280
i sang rob people that stalk us on the internet right are the you gotta

185
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:34,800
Yes, okay, so message to our listeners, stalking us works, and a lot of the people though were

186
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:41,320
people from DDR Freak, well that's cool, but you've got the moderatorship on DDR Freak

187
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:46,440
so a lot of people know who you are over there, and then the show's getting pretty big over

188
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,960
there thanks to the syndication on Friday nights over there on Freak Radio, so.

189
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:57,280
Well, it was just a bunch of people, I met a lot of good people, we basically were just

190
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:02,960
playing 8th style, played, now I brought out Karaoke Revolution.

191
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,440
Now you don't sing karaoke.

192
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:10,240
I don't, but I got the line from Avengers and Babysitting, nobody leaves without singing

193
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,560
the blues.

194
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,160
And that's all it took?

195
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,880
They didn't have to feed you Guinness or anything?

196
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,880
I was begged.

197
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,760
They didn't make you drink Guinness or anything?

198
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,760
You just did it perfectly sober?

199
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:24,920
I just figured it's going to be about another year before I'm back.

200
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,400
And you knew that there were no recording devices present, so...

201
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,880
So I sang Bizarre Love Triangle.

202
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,360
Oh, no, that's a good song.

203
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,360
Yeah.

204
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,560
Now, see, you missed some karaoke action here on the show last week.

205
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:38,080
No, I didn't miss it, I'm sorry.

206
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,080
Sing?

207
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,080
All right.

208
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,440
No, I actually, I was really, I tried to...

209
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,360
Loki's still pissed at me over it, by the way.

210
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:53,120
I actually was going to be trying to tune in on my laptop, but I had promised my mama

211
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:59,000
son I was going to take her to see The Grudge, which after having... Since I was glad I

212
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,640
saw Ju-On first, I'm very glad I saw it first, because then it was neat noting the differences

213
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,640
in the movie.

214
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,600
I'm not going to spoil it for anyone who hasn't, and actually the thing that pissed me off

215
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,760
is that I don't know the reason why they think they have to explain every single last fucking

216
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:19,360
detail to a U.S. audience, when it's the not knowing that is the messed up part of the

217
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:24,640
movie. Even so, I thought it was very good, and even better, especially since it was done

218
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:32,840
by the original director. So, we did that. I went to Steak and Shake. Steak and Shake

219
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:37,360
is the best place ever. What? Steak and Shake... Only in the South, which you have a place

220
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:42,680
called Steak and Shake. It's these thick hamburgers, really good. It's like a little diner type

221
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:47,040
But you can get these humongous milkshakes and they make a half-and-half, but it's literally

222
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,040
split down the middle.

223
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,400
Half one side is one flavor, half the other is the other.

224
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,280
So I actually mixed it up and had banana eggnog.

225
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,280
Huh.

226
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,000
Oh, God, it was good.

227
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
That was orgasm in the glass.

228
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Anyway, no, it didn't taste like tuna.

229
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,080
It tastes like banana and eggnog.

230
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,080
Damn it.

231
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:19,000
I got to meet lots of good people, had a really good time. Monday, my brother was being an

232
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:26,320
ass the whole time. I'm not too proud of my brother Matthew, but I talked to my brother

233
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:37,080
Phillip while I was there. He's supposed to be down for Christmas, I think. He's getting

234
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:42,120
married well he's already married this is my brother who's a marine and his

235
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:47,600
wife's a marine and they're actually going to Texas to have a humongous big

236
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:54,700
Mexican wedding I'm going to go to be a big party will there be margaritas

237
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:59,920
involved likely awesome no actually actually people that know me pretty well

238
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:03,200
know that I'm actually not a big tequila fan I'll drink margaritas because you

239
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,340
I can barely taste the tequila, but I cannot stand straight up tequila.

240
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,800
I am a black man.

241
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,280
You had that cheap shit here.

242
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,280
I still don't like tequila.

243
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,280
You can give me Cuervo.

244
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,280
I don't care.

245
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,280
I still don't like it.

246
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,280
I can do shots of tequila.

247
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,280
I think it's nasty unless...

248
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:25,920
I like the blue agave tequila, the stuff that Anita had way back at the Nasty House.

249
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:31,760
But it was pretty good.

250
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:37,960
I went back to New Orleans on Tuesday, hung out with my mommy, I fussed at my mom, it

251
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,960
was fun.

252
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:48,320
Jamie Fuss had the most long, boring flight back.

253
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:53,800
I hung out at the Dallas airport for nearly two hours.

254
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,800
Airports aren't so bad now, though.

255
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,800
They have Wi-Fi there.

256
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,800
Yeah, they got Wi-Fi.

257
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,800
I was just chilling on my laptop.

258
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,520
Not just that, but just everything there is to do.

259
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,600
They're practically shopping malls as well, although I would never buy anything there,

260
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,600
but it's fun to look.

261
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,600
You know, airports aren't that bad anymore.

262
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,920
Well, some of them are.

263
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:13,240
But I was having a pretty good time, I mean, and then I got on a plane.

264
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:17,520
I read the entirety of Ramsey's The Damned on the plane.

265
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,080
I have to say it's definitely the best Anne Rice book, because all the rest of her stuff

266
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,080
since, it's kind of crap.

267
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,080
It's been gay porn.

268
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,080
Yeah, but it's also been crappy.

269
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,080
Really crappy.

270
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:34,920
really crappy woman needs to get her groove back not rest on her name

271
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:40,280
although I did read the first novel of her Sleeping Beauty book uh-huh very

272
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:45,440
interesting very interesting anyway that was my trip the rest of time I finished

273
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:51,240
homework put up with stupid crap you talking about that Bamani party makes me

274
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:55,640
nostalgic remember when we used to do that stuff at the old studio which is a

275
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,120
really great house for having parties we have the my party we need to do that

276
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,460
shit again yeah we do I mean we actually we kind of had a bimani party last night

277
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:06,860
I mean it wasn't like a hardcore bimani party but I'm sure it will get to that

278
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:10,020
as we go on through how was your week how's your day remember the stuff I

279
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:14,900
would bring with me oh yeah people say the money part of my gosh shit you bring

280
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:19,040
like your old I remember you brought your dreamcast pads to one party yes I

281
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:25,420
did same I said okay this is what GDR was like in the old days before we had

282
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:31,620
had this vivid nonsense. I remember when one of our old guests used

283
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:35,540
to be on the show a bit, Samya Magus, when he put on his girlfriend's top and was playing

284
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:41,660
Power Power Partise, and the picture made some rounds on the internet after that, and

285
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:46,460
I remember Loki would haul his computer and his Delight Delight reduplication and his

286
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:52,100
pads he'd made for it. I'm nostalgic. I would carry around the drum mania, keyboard

287
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:59,380
mania 2d x controller the bunch of games all the old beat mania is my ascii pad

288
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:04,660
do you think that when this ddr thing is dead which you know could happen any day now um

289
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:08,980
do you think that these bimani parties stick a fork in it do you think these bimani parties

290
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:14,980
are still going to be going on no we'll just go back to porn getting this we'll just have

291
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:21,220
to go back to the orgies you're right how silly of me to ask

292
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:25,220
I know it has to get that copy of Ally McFeel again.

293
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,220
That was funny.

294
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:29,220
Anyway, anything else you want to share about your week and your day?

295
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,220
Uh, no.

296
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,220
Moving right along. All right.

297
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:39,220
Hey, it had a cameo by Ron Jeremy.

298
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,220
Everything has a cameo by Ron Jeremy.

299
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:49,220
Oh my god, I was looking up, um, there's a site online that's like these, uh, just paper dolls online

300
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:55,300
I was trying to make a new avatar for myself on my live journal, and I accidentally came

301
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,300
across the real doll site.

302
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,380
Oh God.

303
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,580
It's very, very icky.

304
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:05,420
I have a request for a new DDR Freak avatar, because the gay pimp one you made me is really

305
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,420
cool.

306
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,420
I have a request for a new one.

307
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:12,300
I want Zander from Drawn Together, just to make Seager jealous.

308
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,300
From what?

309
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,860
Drawn Together, that show on Comedy Central.

310
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:15,860
From what?

311
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:16,860
Oh girl, you are so far behind.

312
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:21,340
I do not have anything but basic channels, but local channels.

313
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,340
You're missing out.

314
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,340
It's a funny show.

315
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,340
I hardly ever watch TV.

316
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,740
And I think the TV is retarded.

317
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,820
I don't even watch Survivor or The Apprentice or any of that reality bullshit anymore.

318
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:31,180
Drawn Together is like the only show I watch.

319
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,580
And when did Hell Freeze Over?

320
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,580
I know.

321
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,580
I know.

322
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,380
Do you want to talk about Hell Freezing Over?

323
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:41,260
I came this close to joining a gym on Friday.

324
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:51,260
For the people who didn't have that visual, Rob held his fingers the length of, um, never mind.

325
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,260
He's not gonna talk about that.

326
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,260
Shut up.

327
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:58,260
No, because we don't bring up old drama.

328
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,260
Yeah.

329
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:02,260
What?

330
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:06,260
Oh, man.

331
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:09,260
It says that when you said Xander, I started thinking of Buffy.

332
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:15,260
I need to respond to some stuff in the chat room going on right now.

333
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:19,340
First off, Seegert is telling me he hates me because of the Xander thing and he says

334
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:21,300
his is better, whatever.

335
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:27,620
And somebody else, where was it, a couple of people commented, DDR is not going to die.

336
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:31,180
Well, I'm only being half serious.

337
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:34,860
I don't think the death of DDR is anytime soon, especially when we just got like Ultra

338
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:38,440
Mix 2 and the home versions are looking very promising for the future.

339
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:43,880
I don't think DDR is seriously going to die, but I think it's a little more cultish, maybe.

340
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,880
I don't know.

341
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,880
We'll see.

342
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,880
I also have an announcement.

343
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,880
Yes.

344
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,760
I no longer am on the Atkins crap.

345
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,760
Well, not crap.

346
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,160
It's good for a lot of people.

347
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,280
It was not good for me.

348
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,520
So I can have sushi again.

349
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,320
Congratulations.

350
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,480
Sushi is wonderful.

351
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:04,960
And and and and and and and.

352
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,960
Nothing else.

353
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,960
Okay.

354
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,960
Oh, Rob.

355
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:12,520
yes, what? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What?

356
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:16,600
Hi! I'm back!

357
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:20,260
Damn. Angel, how was your week, how was your day?

358
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:23,760
You gave me a fairy to throw. Angel, how was your week, how was your day?

359
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:29,080
School was school and...

360
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:34,080
Oh, nothing. Saturday was nice. I just wanted to waste

361
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:44,160
the week away until saturday came cuz uh well i had a birthday come on everybody yay yay yay

362
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:54,160
not actually hanging out with everyone was great um and we had played lots of bumani

363
00:26:54,160 --> 00:27:17,160
I got to see those for the first time. That was pretty cool. And the best thing of all was obviously hanging around with the people that I don't usually get to hang around with. So, that was good. And just enjoying my birthday weekend so far, I guess.

364
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:21,160
Now,

365
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:25,180
Bradley, how was your week? How was your day?

366
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,200
Alright, this week was

367
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:33,220
work of course. And an interesting thing happened at work. There was

368
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:37,240
a person, my kind of work is sort of a training

369
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:41,260
they train people to do stuff. So, when the students came back, he had some questions

370
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:45,280
for, because he was going to do a test, a state test for his line of work

371
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:51,640
wanted to get into. And they come back to ask him questions and he and the instructor

372
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:57,720
had a nice, somehow a disagreement or something about the instructor doesn't like this guy

373
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:04,320
so he actually misspoke and said that he didn't like him. So this caused them to get really

374
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:10,060
angry and start ranting and raving and then he had to go outside, the manager had to take

375
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:14,880
him outside and talk for like an hour to try to calm him down. They came back on Friday

376
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:20,880
And his wife told him to bring on some candy just to give to us, or something like that.

377
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,880
And he comes back and, okay, he's like, hell, here's this candy.

378
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:29,880
And then he starts launching into this big thing about discrimination!

379
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,880
He discriminates against me! He doesn't like me!

380
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,880
For some reason, like, some bullshit like that.

381
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:40,880
And so, just me and the perceptionists are in their room and he's like,

382
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:49,360
some kind of weird shit like that so good thing the boss came in like like a

383
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,600
few minutes like a minute later and then started to talk to him so we could sneak

384
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:58,320
out so I went out in the hall for about an hour while they discussed something

385
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,040
over and over again because this is a kind of guy just like says the same

386
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:05,640
thing like ten fucking times to try to make some sort of point that no one

387
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:09,480
gives a shit about because he finally overreacts everything and thankfully

388
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:12,740
after that, about an hour, they moved into the office and talked another hour and a half

389
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:13,740
or so.

390
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:16,000
Were they getting paid for this?

391
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
To talk?

392
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,240
Well, it's a business, so it's part of the work.

393
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:25,360
I always found that humorous when, you know, there's big fights going on and we have to

394
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,600
sit down and have a discussion, but we're all getting paid for it type thing.

395
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,800
We just wasted three hours of productivity to talk out.

396
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:35,520
Not that I ever get into disagreements with people, but you know, I've had to sit in on

397
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,520
them.

398
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,520
Well, I didn't have anything to do with it.

399
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,520
I just went and stood in the hall because I didn't want to get involved.

400
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,820
but you got paid for it too

401
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,520
yes it is nice one hour

402
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,520
like an hour break

403
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,780
not doing anything

404
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:48,120
just wait until it cools down

405
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,500
okay and then one day i got

406
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,080
Katamari Damacy

407
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,020
and that was a lot of fun

408
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,820
na na na na na na na

409
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,820
sorry every time something- it's like

410
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:59,480
it's like, but everybody says, friends

411
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,300
you think of nbc

412
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,940
or, or when someone says 90210

413
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,300
da da da da

414
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,080
da da da da

415
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:12,080
With Katamari it's na na na na na na na na na na na na.

416
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,080
Shut up, Logan.

417
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,080
No, actually, I think of that.

418
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,080
I say that in that song too.

419
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,080
I played that most every day this week.

420
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:24,080
Actually, I did play it this week except for today because I got up.

421
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:30,080
Last night was the party for Angel and Anita, or Dee Dee Archipolic, for their birthdays.

422
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:36,080
And that was a lot of fun because Navi brought over 8 style and pop music.

423
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,400
god bless the town's pop and music horror.

424
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:43,240
I got to play on those arcade-style controllers.

425
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:48,280
Yeah, and that was fun.

426
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,680
Of course, I didn't do all that great on 8th style, because basically,

427
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:57,240
he had it up on a stand, and then the TV was down like two or three feet,

428
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,600
several feet away.

429
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,840
And of course, I hadn't played on an arcade-style controller

430
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,240
in a long time.

431
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,320
And of course, there was the hard new song.

432
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:19,320
just like, oh god, like, oh what the hell is it called? Nebulagraspur? Nebulagraspur is a fucking impossible. Well at least for a first try it's like, oh fuck, what the hell? Like all over the place.

433
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:37,320
And I always love non-Bamani people, like the people who don't really play 2DX, DDR, and stuff. I always love their reaction to stuff like that, because there were a few people at the party last night who don't really play DDR or 2DX, and they were just kind of watching Navi playing, and just like he was just crazy. He was playing like Nebio Grasp or another or something, and just everybody was just kind of like,

434
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:45,320
That's crazy. That is so crazy. Man, that's crazy.

435
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:50,160
Yeah, actually I played Pop music for the first time ever because it's the first time

436
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:54,880
I've actually been to anything where it's been brought out and actually passed like

437
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:05,000
a, I think I backed to 22 on 9's button, that was pretty good, and today we got up

438
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,920
late so it didn't do that all that much and that's all.

439
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:14,840
Mr. Loki, how was your week, how was your day?

440
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:30,840
Today did not start out too good, due to certain events that have taken place outside of our apartment complex in the street. It was not fun. Well, we'll get into that later, I'm sure.

441
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:44,840
And then yesterday, it was okay. I went down to Knights Ferry to go ghost hunting supposedly, and just walked around there for a little bit. It was fun, hiking and stuff.

442
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:50,840
Friday wasn't that good either. Grandparents, er, grandma died, so that sucked.

443
00:32:50,840 --> 00:33:06,840
Thursday, I can't remember Thursday. Thursday was okay, I guess. Most of the week I've been just playing Final Fantasy XI, leveling my summoner to 20, which I just finished right before the show.

444
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:17,840
And, um, what else have I been doing? I've played a little bit of Grand Theft Auto, finally passed this mission, and I couldn't beat for a while, and now I have to run errands for some pimp.

445
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:27,840
And, um, went and saw Closer. I'll get into that later. And, um, eh, that's about all.

446
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:33,840
It's been, like, kind of a week just crashing into the ground.

447
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:37,680
That sucks about your grandma, I'm sorry to hear it.

448
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:40,960
Have you used your machine to try and contact her yet?

449
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,680
No I have not, you asshole.

450
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,680
Anyway...

451
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:51,000
How did you ever open your portal to hell?

452
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,840
You went on a ghost busting trip yesterday, didn't you?

453
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,840
Hunting.

454
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,400
Ghost hunting, not busting.

455
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:01,000
We just, we went, walked around Knights Ferry, which is basically this old abandoned, it's

456
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:06,660
not really an abandoned mining town. It's just an old mining town. It's got like a bunch

457
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:11,340
of dilapidated... It's not really a mining town, I guess. They have an old mill there

458
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:16,900
that's kind of been... It's just the ruins of it. So we just walked around there. They

459
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:22,920
also have a very long... They have a 150 meter covered bridge, which is pretty neat, and

460
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:28,400
we walked down that and we went to their graveyard that was there and walked around that for

461
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:32,960
a little bit but you know I mean these are just for is just kind of just to get

462
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:37,740
out of the house we you know we're looking for like an actual place that my

463
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:43,180
my example was something that's more trauma there than you know old you know

464
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:47,540
because necessarily just visiting any old place is not going to work you need

465
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:50,840
to have something where oh yeah 50 people murdered there you know that kind

466
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:55,180
of thing just something you know traumatic like a insane asylum or

467
00:34:55,180 --> 00:35:02,180
kostjamrh And by tired he means looking for a party in Final Fantasy 11 so he can get a summoner to level 3.

468
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:42,180
At it? No, I was tired from other things, but yes, I just got bored with that too. But the other things in the morning made me tired because I'm exhausted right now from having to wake up early yesterday and having to wake up early today.

469
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:53,180
Alright, my turn. My week and my day. I got to play 8th style and pop music 10 twice this week, actually, because I hung out with Navi on Monday. I'll talk about those games a little bit later, because, you know, I don't want to talk about my money stuff in a little bit.

470
00:35:53,180 --> 00:36:02,180
But, Navi and I, after playing some of that, we got to go to the mall, and I was going to help him do some Christmas shopping over at Arden Fair, which is a big mall in Sacramento. It's a huge mall.

471
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:11,180
And so, we ended up walking out of there. He didn't end up buying anything. He just kind of looked around us in different places. And I fucking bought an iPod at the Apple store.

472
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:16,180
cuz I wanted one really I I wanted one really bad

473
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:18,180
I'm still two away from my free one

474
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:22,180
I don't just buy a fucking iMac you know just join the cult

475
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,180
I thought about it actually

476
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:28,180
good it's a big fleeing piece of shit that doesn't do anything

477
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:30,180
you make Apple users cry anyway

478
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,180
unless you're into graphics

479
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:34,180
or media which you know this show happens to be

480
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:36,180
cuz all the pros are on Macs

481
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:39,180
maybe we wouldn't have the freaking buzz on a Mac

482
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,180
anyway

483
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:42,180
Hey, you wouldn't have any of the software either!

484
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:14,660
eject CDs anymore and now I won't even play the CD that's in there. So luckily

485
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:18,380
though it has an auxiliary port in it so I can plug anything I want in there so

486
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:21,380
I'm just like fuck it I'm gonna get an iPod and I'll just use that as my car

487
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:24,460
stereo. So it's worked out really well except for the fact that if you think

488
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:27,940
somebody if you think I'm bad when I'm talking on my cell phone and trying to

489
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:31,580
drive you should see me when I'm trying to find the song on my iPod I want to

490
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:37,380
hear and drive at the same time. It's beautiful and you know what they can

491
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:41,040
pass all the laws they want to say I can't talk on my cell phone and drive

492
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:41,420
but

493
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:45,580
I don't see them making any law anytime soon that says I can't play on my iPod and try

494
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:46,980
to drive at the same time so

495
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:51,140
look out. I believe the law is operation of electronical devices while driving

496
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:54,900
so your iPod is included. God dammit!

497
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:57,940
Your car is technically an operational device.

498
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:01,540
extraneous like CD, well like

499
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:04,420
laptops, peripheral devices

500
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:10,380
Secret in our chat room right now over at orangelandrader.com, he says that that day

501
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:16,520
where my Echo Image CD got eaten by my car stereo player, he said that that day kind

502
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:20,660
of pissed him off, except for the Classic Gaming Expo and the little girl that was hitting

503
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,860
all the buttons on the restrooms that she rocked.

504
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:27,100
And that reminds me, I actually found the picture of Jamie doing that at Classic Gaming

505
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,100
Expo.

506
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,380
I had my heads in the air.

507
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:31,380
What was it?

508
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,380
We paid you $10 to do it?

509
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,380
Yeah.

510
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,380
I wanted on Pac-Land for the TurboGrafx.

511
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:37,380
Yeah, we bought some game for you, basically.

512
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:39,380
For you to imitate little girl. I found the picture.

513
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:41,380
I'm gonna send it to Seagurd.

514
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:46,380
By the way, we're going to Classic Gaming Expo again this year.

515
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,380
Even though...

516
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:48,380
It's in Burlingame.

517
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:50,380
Even though last year was kinda...

518
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:54,380
The only reason that last year's was end was because they had that thing a few days before.

519
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:57,380
But, uh, Classic Gaming Expo this year is gonna be in Burlingame.

520
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:59,380
That means trips to network video!

521
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:03,380
And the store that sells the airsoft guns.

522
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:32,560
of it and I don't know what it was we were playing cranium but it wasn't just

523
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:36,340
regular cranium but it was turbo cranium okay so it's supposed to be like a

524
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:40,100
faster version of cranium like one that you could play like in an hour the

525
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:44,940
freaking game took us three hours to play the last time I played cranium it

526
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:48,940
only took two turbo cranium ended up taking longer what in the hell is up with

527
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:52,460
that and no it's not because we kept taking breaks it just was a long-ass

528
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:57,140
game was no shorter nobody's gonna get this joke but you Rob but you can be my

529
00:39:57,140 --> 00:40:04,400
puppet master anytime how foul hey but how long did the I had ended up having

530
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,760
to leave around midnight because I was kind of afraid well a I was tired and B

531
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,360
I was afraid I wasn't gonna be able to park when I got back here if I waited

532
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:14,780
any longer but how was the rest of the night good we ended up playing hear me

533
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:22,200
out well the majority of the night I mean we played pop in ten also but yeah

534
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:28,280
that other game was kind of weird also um a DD alcoholic made sushi from

535
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,840
scratch it was really good but it was kind of interesting because she used

536
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:34,980
wieners in it like she used hot dogs and instead of fish she put like hot dogs in

537
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:38,600
there but it was actually really good it was kind of weird I just thought was

538
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:44,240
neat it was very resourceful it was a good idea anyway uh we're gonna take a

539
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,360
break when we come back from this break we're gonna talk a little bit more about

540
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:50,400
2d x8 style we're gonna talk a little more about pop music 10 I want to play

541
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:56,140
the new remix of I Feel for you guys. We played it on Thursday night, but I know nobody listens

542
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:59,020
to Outside the Box on Thursday night, but more of you guys listen tonight, so we're

543
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:05,460
going to play the new I Feel mix from, I keep calling it Service Pack, Song Pack 7 from

544
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:07,600
UltraMix 2, because a lot of people don't want to hear that, so we're going to play

545
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:11,540
that for you guys. And plenty more when we come back from this break. In this break though,

546
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:15,740
some music from DDR Festival, because we haven't really gotten to hear much music from DDR

547
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:19,980
Festival yet, but we have some songs for you guys. We're going to hear Superstar, Diamonds,

548
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:26,980
Cutie Honey on this break. We'll be right back.

549
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:53,980
And it feels good as to if I've been cooking

550
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:56,980
Does that really want to laugh at you?

551
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:02,980
I'm feeling some connection to the things you do

552
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:06,980
I don't know what it is that makes me feel like this

553
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,980
I don't know who you are

554
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:13,980
But you must be some kind of superstar

555
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:18,980
Cause you got a lot to do no matter where you are

556
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:52,980
Cause you gotta love it no matter where you are

557
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:56,980
Where you are, I wanna take you there

558
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:24,980
I know

559
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:26,980
I'm your Doki-chan

560
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:28,980
This time

561
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:30,980
I am your

562
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:32,980
Kangaro-mon-to

563
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:34,980
I am your

564
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:36,980
Doki-chan

565
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:38,980
This time

566
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:39,980
Hey!

567
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:40,980
Hey!

568
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:41,980
Hey!

569
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:42,980
Hey!

570
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:43,980
Hey!

571
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:44,980
Hey!

572
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:23,980
Mr. Random person on the street, who by the way is not an actor. What do you think of the Orange Lounge big money music and more shows?

573
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:36,980
The music is like being transported to this dancing spaceship place. It's unearthly. It's like being in a club, except you don't have to ask someone to dance.

574
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:43,760
We are back here on orange lounge radio festival has some strange music in it. It's honestly I didn't bother to buy festival

575
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:49,020
I just I didn't think there was enough in it for me because I had extreme and I have an Xbox so and I had

576
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:54,080
Ultra mix one which were a lot of songs came from but festival certainly has some quirky little songs in it, doesn't it?

577
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:57,820
Interesting. It's all I have to say although I love superstar

578
00:46:57,820 --> 00:47:02,000
I it's almost worth buying the mix for that but not really because that's like 80 bucks

579
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Yeah it does have different steps for a lot of the songs that were on UltraMix 1, but I don't know, honestly with UltraMix 2 now and the fact that you can make your own edits, I have a feeling that any day now we're going to start seeing those steps get uploaded to Xbox Live, so I'm not really too concerned about it.

580
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,000
It's just somebody has to take the effort and that person is not going to be me because I'm lazy.

581
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Anyway, 2DX8 style.

582
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Got a chance to check it out over at, um, Navi, POD Music Horror.

583
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,000
He has it. I got to check it out earlier this week. And man do I suck at 2DX now.

584
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,000
I mean seriously, I haven't played 2DX seriously in quite a while.

585
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:46,000
I didn't really get into 7th style. I played it one time. A lot of this has to do with the fact that my controller is broken.

586
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:58,000
And I'd rather buy myself a lot of other useless crap, like iPods and things like that, than buy a new 2DX controller, and I seriously think that's the reason that I haven't been playing a whole lot of 2DX.

587
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,000
But 8 style is pretty sweet, I gotta say. It has a lot of great new songs in it.

588
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Those of you guys that listen to this show regularly, you already know how I feel about Everyday Lovely Day, like I love that song.

589
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
And then of course it has a bunch of 2DX Red songs in it.

590
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,400
Well, not a bunch, but three, which I consider to be a bunch for, you know, preview, because

591
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,640
usually it's only like one or two.

592
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:21,640
And then, some of the new consumer videos are pretty funny.

593
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:25,000
Like Step Into the New World, I don't really like that song a whole lot, the song kind

594
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,040
of, meh, but the video's pretty great, like with the anime and everything and the guy

595
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:33,140
running down the street, and he uses his computer animation technique that's very interesting,

596
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:38,160
like it turns these 2D settings into 3D, kind of like Parappa the Rappa, it looks like that,

597
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,840
except not drawn.

598
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:43,280
I guess that makes no sense whatsoever, I don't care.

599
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:46,700
And then also another video I love is Love Box.

600
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:50,580
I don't know if you guys got to see this video at all, but Love Box is the one that has,

601
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:56,120
I think it's Meg, and one of her cohorts or something, I don't know, an uncredited person.

602
00:48:56,120 --> 00:49:00,380
They're dressed up as these like Austin Powers dance chicks, kind of.

603
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:04,780
Like they're all dressed in these like 60s hippie, like things you'd see on Laugh-In.

604
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:06,240
You remember that old show Laugh-In?

605
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,000
Like when the people would be dancing?

606
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,100
It was kind of like that and they're just driving around the city and singing and they're

607
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:14,540
wearing like glow bracelets and stuff.

608
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:16,180
It's really great.

609
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:17,180
Love box.

610
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:19,180
I highly recommend this one.

611
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:24,960
Although the song kind of sucks, but the video is great.

612
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,140
So you guys have gotten to play 8 style a little bit too.

613
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:30,500
What do you guys think of 2DX8 style?

614
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:33,140
I suck at Let Me Go of Bara.

615
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:34,740
Oh I remember that song was so great.

616
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:37,180
And the scene kept falling out of my lap.

617
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:41,120
I miss arcades.

618
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:44,600
Were you playing on a regular, like, little controller?

619
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:48,080
Yeah. See, Navi has one of those arcade-style controllers, so you don't have to put it in your lap.

620
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:50,160
But they're kinda loud, like, they're really...

621
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:53,440
those arcade-style ones are really loud. Like, you could hear that thing probably

622
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,040
outside, like, a mile away.

623
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:59,160
Clack, clack, clack. But that's pretty neat. And sometimes it kinda overpowers the music,

624
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:02,400
but it plays beautifully. It plays so beautifully.

625
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,320
Arcadian, what do you think of 2DXC's style?

626
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:07,120
look pretty nice

627
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,060
something you think you might have to break down a purchase

628
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:12,240
I already have purchased it. Oh, have you? I just haven't gotten it yet.

629
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,440
You probably mentioned it, I forgot.

630
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:19,340
Yeah, I mentioned it like two weeks ago. That's right. I forgot.

631
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:20,720
Any

632
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:25,560
particularly favorite consumer songs that you like, any of these songs?

633
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,600
I haven't heard them enough to

634
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,920
truly say yet.

635
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:34,400
I played a new seven star. I think it was Don't Be Afraid Myself was one of the

636
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:38,160
like it's the j-pop one that's got a really especially got a pretty great

637
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:43,480
that's got a pretty cool video in the bathroom in the shower I think so I

638
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:46,760
think they were dancing in like a locker room shower yes I think that might have

639
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:50,320
been it I could only kind of half see the video that's cool yeah the song is

640
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:54,640
cool but man I fucked up that song so bad like it really shows like how out of

641
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:58,160
it on 2dx I am because I can't sight read anymore like I was able to play

642
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:01,560
attitude and star dream and all these songs I used to play all the time on

643
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:06,080
eight style

644
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:10,380
just fine

645
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:14,160
but dancer

646
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:18,480
is it just me or is it something kind of weird at the end of the video

647
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:21,360
it freezes kind of at the end of the video

648
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:25,540
I remember it kinda faded out in the arcade

649
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:30,440
but a lot of eight style machines had broken videos in the first place so that was the first time that a lot of people got to actually play

650
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:35,720
of the videos? I don't know. Pretty cool. Angel, what were your thoughts on T-X-A-Style?

651
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:41,600
Love Is Orange, Attitude, and A. That's all I have to say. Because, you know, I used to

652
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:45,480
watch you guys play that all the time, and I was always all envious, and I still am,

653
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:50,440
so, yeah. A is technically a seventh style song, but

654
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:54,120
it does make, well, I know, but it does make a repeat in eighth style. It's interesting,

655
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:59,840
they take, they took some of the most noteworthy seventh style songs, like A and Stoic, and

656
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:02,620
They ended up repeating on 8th style after all, so now I'm kind of like, do I really

657
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:04,300
need to get 7th style?

658
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:09,020
But then I remembered, yes, I want to hoard Beauty of Silence in the privacy of my own

659
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:10,900
home, is basically what it boils down to.

660
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:14,340
Just like, remember the old arcade days, frickin' everybody hoarded Beauty of Silence, well,

661
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:15,780
almost everybody.

662
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:20,660
I know I was a big part of that, but, like, player's best would be 5-1-1, because all

663
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:26,260
the noobs would play 5-1-1, and then, like, Beauty of Silence.

664
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:27,260
Anyway.

665
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:31,260
Poppin' Music 10 was another game I got to check out earlier this week.

666
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:36,260
Pretty cool. I have to admit, I think I kind of like the way 9 is set up a little bit better.

667
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:42,260
I thought the unlock system in 9 was a lot cooler, because 10 has this wacky roulette thing.

668
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:48,260
Navi had the timing down perfect, though, so that he was managing to unlock quite a bit of stuff on the roulette wheel.

669
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:56,260
But it was kind of yawned to me, because the Gambler Z thing in 9 was way cooler, where you could walk around and unlock things and play songs and stuff.

670
00:52:56,260 --> 00:53:00,380
I was a little disappointed by that. But the song list was pretty good in 10. There's a

671
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:03,820
lot of great songs I love in 10. Of course, Goonies, you know, we hoard that song like

672
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:08,140
crazy here on Orange Lounge. Arabatia, the Revenge song, love that song. And I actually

673
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:13,140
passed it on E, what is it, what's the second one up? Not EX, that's the third one up. Hyper?

674
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:17,900
Is that the second level? It's like Basic and Hyper. See, I don't know my pop music,

675
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:22,580
it's so sad. The middle one, wherever it's ranked, like a 30 or something. 29, 30, I

676
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:31,860
Somebody needs to get me $1,000 for Christmas, so that way I can buy an ASC for 2DX, an ASC

677
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:37,940
for pop music, and then import 8 style and as many pop music as I can before I'm bankrupt.

678
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:45,820
So if you guys want to get me $1,000 for Christmas, that would be great.

679
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:49,820
Did you play Popin' 10 at all at that party that you went to, Jamie?

680
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:53,820
I didn't have Popin' 10. I bought Popin' 9 with me, but we ended up not playing it.

681
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:57,820
Oh. Okay. Well, what did you think of Pop Music 10, Angel?

682
00:53:57,820 --> 00:54:01,820
It was pretty, and watching Navi play is just

683
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:05,820
insane. He plays

684
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:09,820
faster than anyone else I've seen, you know, but

685
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:13,820
I just ended up watching it because I knew a lot of people wanted to play

686
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:20,700
pop and 10, so I just kind of left it at that, plus we were busy with Cranium anyways, so,

687
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:21,700
you know.

688
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:28,020
Yeah, by the way, if anybody wants to call us, we just opened up the Skype line, if you

689
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:32,260
want to figure out what that's all about, head on over to www.orangelaunceradio.com

690
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:36,060
and click on interact with us, and we want to take some phone calls asking you guys that

691
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:39,820
have gotten a chance to play 8 style or pop music 10, what you guys think of it.

692
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:44,800
I have to say that the final verdict on Ten, I kind of, I mean obviously I need to play

693
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:48,960
it more, and obviously I still want it, but I still think I kind of like Nine just a little

694
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:53,960
bit better. I just think Nine had some, just set up a little better, just kind of had some

695
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:58,120
better songs, but Ten's really good, don't get me wrong. I would still buy Ten in a heartbeat,

696
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:05,120
but I just think I like Nine a little bit better. But, anyway. Arcadian, you got to

697
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:10,520
play a little bit of pop in 10 what'd you think? Not bad. I can't compare it to any

698
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:13,560
other ones because I haven't played any other ones. Oh, I thought you have played the other

699
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:17,380
ones. No, this is the first time I've ever played it. Oh, wow, okay. So that's why you

700
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:21,120
were playing five key in the beginning there. I was kind of like, Katie is playing five

701
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:26,020
key. I was playing like three songs and I said, let's go tonight. And it's okay to play

702
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:29,560
five key when you're first learning pop music, that's okay. Let's get, we're going to take

703
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:34,840
call real fast. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Hey there, Sky, Siggy here. Hi Siggy,

704
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:41,160
how you doing? I'm doing fine. You know what, I finally figured out what you were talking

705
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:44,760
about last week with the 2DX8 style. You remember how you said there was something in it that

706
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:48,760
looked like extreme US and a lot of people in the chat were going, what the fuck is he

707
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:53,000
talking about? You remember that? Yeah. I got what you meant now. It was the menu in

708
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:57,120
the beginning kind of have that like round wheel thing?

709
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:02,440
Yeah, it's the menu. Gotcha. So, you got your copy of Eight Cell, yes?

710
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:04,320
Yup. And how have you been enjoying it?

711
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:08,600
Yeah, I'm enjoying it. It's really good. I was one of the lucky ones who got the 2DX

712
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:12,880
Red E amusement card, because after November 18th, they don't have it anymore.

713
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:14,080
Really? Yeah.

714
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:17,800
So is there anything special about the card, or is it just the fact that, hey, I got a

715
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:21,920
card? Actually, I wanted to use this 2DX Red E

716
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:26,000
the amusement card at AI because they have the amusement card readers.

717
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
That's what I heard.

718
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:32,200
Now, I'm actually going to be able to go to Arcade Infinity next week.

719
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:33,200
I'm hoping.

720
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,760
The amusement card over there.

721
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:38,520
Well, I don't have any amusement card because I'm ghetto poor and I haven't bought any.

722
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:39,520
Buy it over there.

723
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:40,520
That's what I meant.

724
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:41,520
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking about doing.

725
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:42,520
I'm thinking about buying...

726
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:45,960
Depending on how much they cost, I might buy a bunch and give some away here on the station.

727
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:46,960
I'm thinking about it.

728
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:47,960
Yeah, that's cool.

729
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:48,960
Yeah.

730
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:49,960
Thinking about it.

731
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:55,960
Yeah, recently I double A'd a V35 on 7key.

732
00:56:55,960 --> 00:57:01,960
See, V35 is one of those songs I used to be really good at, but then I just suck it up now. What is that you're holding up there? A Namco?

733
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:04,960
My Tekken 5 character data card.

734
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:09,960
Get on topic! No, it's cool. Have you gotten to play pop music 10 at all?

735
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:15,960
Uh, no. The last time I played pop music was Pop Music 9 back in San Francisco.

736
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:17,960
See, but isn't Pop Music 9 great?

737
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:20,960
I think so, anyway.

738
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:25,960
So, anything else you want to share about 2DX8's style, your experiences you're having with it?

739
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:27,960
Well, um...

740
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:30,960
There's a thing about the...

741
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:34,960
Getting the hidden songs, the 2DX1 songs.

742
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:36,960
You don't have to...

743
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:38,960
About the easy thing.

744
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:40,960
It turns out to be false.

745
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:42,960
What do you mean?

746
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:54,960
You can't play easy songs by unlocking spiral galaxy and taio. By using an easy option.

747
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:56,960
So you can't play an easy to unlock those songs?

748
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:57,960
You can.

749
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:58,960
Oh you can?

750
00:57:58,960 --> 00:57:59,960
Yeah.

751
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:01,960
Well shit, that makes it easy doesn't it?

752
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:05,960
And what is the requirement again to start unlocking some of these 2DX Red songs? Because I actually don't remember.

753
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:11,960
Play at least about a hundred songs to unlock Spiral Galaxy and Taiyou.

754
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:14,960
Wow. A hundred songs?

755
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:20,960
Well, yeah, just mostly Light Sevens, or Light Seven to Seven Key songs.

756
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:24,960
I'm not afraid of playing Seven Key. I've got to play some more to get better at it.

757
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:28,960
I want Light Seven, just for the heck of it.

758
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:34,200
I would play, now see Light 7 would be the kind of thing I would play to

759
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:39,440
whore my VJ Army account up if I had one. Hypothetically if I had one. I'd be all

760
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:43,560
look at all these triple A's I got. Of course it was on Light 7. But man,

761
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:47,480
I'm good. Cause I know, I know that there's people out there that do that.

762
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:50,840
I mean but that's okay you know Light 7's are songs too. You have every right.

763
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:54,480
But you know. And there's another for random

764
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:58,320
plus. You have to play at least a hundred songs to unlock random plus.

765
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:01,320
And what exactly does Random Plus do again for those that...

766
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:05,320
Uh, Random Plus is where the turntable is now included in the shuffle.

767
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:08,320
Oh. Oh, okay, I gotcha.

768
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:13,320
Oh, that would be so hard if you got some scales that, oh god, that's really crazy.

769
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:16,320
Especially, you know, especially War Game.

770
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:19,320
I hate that song.

771
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:20,320
I can only imagine.

772
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:23,320
Well, War Game on 7Q was never a big problem for me.

773
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:26,320
For some reason, scratching, I'm like, I'm okay with it.

774
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:31,800
okay with it. Checking you out was the second 7 star I ever beat, and now I understand it's

775
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:37,120
an 8 star. So like, I beat an 8 star, like, when I was beating my first 7 star. That is

776
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:42,160
so crazy to me. But for some reason, scratching has never bothered me. After you play a hundred

777
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:51,360
songs with random, just hold the key 2, and then wait for the random to go red. And that's

778
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:54,880
how it works. Yeah, that's how it works. So, those of you guys that are feeling a little

779
00:59:54,880 --> 01:00:00,640
crazy and want to play some random with the turntable. There you have it. What would you

780
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:05,440
say would be your favorite new video in 2DX8 style? I haven't seen all of them because

781
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:13,560
I'm really busy playing 7T songs. I like Nebula Grasp for a lot. Nebula Grasp has got a pretty

782
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:17,640
good video too. It's one of those futuristic, typical kind of things. It kind of reminded

783
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:22,440
me of Hyperboundary 8 a little bit. That was an LED song too and it had all the futuristic

784
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:26,120
the graphics with it. Kind of reminded me of that a little bit. And I bought a 2DX

785
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:32,680
Red Style. I really like Spiral Galaxy as well. Were you able to get the V-Rare when

786
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:40,480
you got? Oh, no, no, I didn't. Just a regular one I ordered. Oh, okay. Alright. Well, anything

787
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:45,400
else you want to share about 2DX A-Style? Well, nothing much else. Alright. Well, we'll

788
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:50,360
talk to you later then, I guess. Have a good one, Ziggy. Alright, later. Later! I like

789
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:55,080
getting phone calls. That was fun. Alright. People say in our chat room right now, they

790
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:58,160
said, they're talking about 2DX too much. Well, it is the news that's going on right

791
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:02,400
now, you know, you guys, but fine. We're going to talk about a little bit of DDR. We're going

792
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:08,280
to try and get the, I Feel, the new remix for you. Look, he's going to get that taken

793
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:11,960
care of during the next break, right? Yes. Good. Then I guess we're going to go to a

794
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:15,560
break so we can get that song. We're going to hear some music from DDR Festival, some

795
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:22,000
more music? Yes, Jamie? What? Thank you. We'll do the second mix break in a bit, but I want

796
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,700
to get the festival stuff taken care of first. Yes, I did threaten the chat room with some

797
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:30,640
butterfly and I know that's first mix, but I want to get that in there too, at some point.

798
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:36,240
So let's see what you can do. But in this break, a different version of Udoru, I can't

799
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:44,240
even say this, you know the Captain Jack song from fifth mix? Udoru. Yeah, that song. There's

800
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:47,240
I can do a version of it in festival so we're gonna hear this I haven't heard

801
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:51,120
this one yet so I got to check this out a remix of I need you which was a song

802
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:56,960
that was kind of a in the DDR max 2 USA but we'll hear it see if it's any better

803
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:04,080
here's the thing about I need you and it wasn't in well yeah max you say this was

804
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:08,440
the one that was on the V rare for the last mix all right that wasn't too bad

805
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:10,560
all right so we'll check it out we're gonna check out these songs and we'll be

806
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:13,360
back and we're gonna talk a little bit more about Ultramix to some of the news

807
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:16,840

808
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:22,160
Week, all that good stuff coming up. And in the chat room they're saying, look, since

809
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:28,160
you're so white, Sky, just say dancing pom-pom-colin. And even that I can't say right. I just, I

810
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:35,160
cut out for radio, what can I say? We'll be back.

811
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:00,160
I don't know what I'm gonna do

812
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:02,160
Eki no naka

813
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:34,160
Believe, believe, believe

814
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:39,160
The promise of love for the happy one

815
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:43,160
All your thoughts won't wait until I'm with you

816
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:47,160
No, it's not a way to step on the line

817
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:50,160
Don't judge my way, don't you

818
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:53,160
I need you, need you

819
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:57,160
And you ain't gonna tell me none more

820
01:06:57,160 --> 01:06:59,140
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

821
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:01,620
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

822
01:07:01,940 --> 01:07:03,880
Hey, hey, hey!

823
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:07,180
Hey! Hey! Hey!

824
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:16,300
Gaming radio, so uncensored

825
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,360
That even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us

826
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:21,080
Uh, Moch-

827
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:22,400
brake, isn't hard

828
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:24,400
Orange Lounge Radio

829
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:35,000
God bless you Tom Brokaw. You know he finally retired. He did? Yeah. This is the last we

830
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:40,200
had time. One of the most highly rated episodes of the show of all time or something like

831
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:45,280
that. I don't know. Something like that. Crazy. Anyway, we are going to be playing the new

832
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:50,680
I Feel remix. We just, we ripped it during the break there. Loki, our tech massa is working

833
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:54,120
on it right now trying to get it all perfect. I said we should just rip it out

834
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:58,820
of edit mode but apparently if you try to rip it in edit mode it cuts off the

835
01:07:58,820 --> 01:08:02,160
very beginning little speech thing because it starts off as do you feel it

836
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:04,640
like it sounds like one of those like speaking spells or something saying it

837
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:09,960
and Loki was like no we can't have that so he made us go back and do it in edit

838
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:13,760
mode so whatever that's fine at least we'll have it we can put it in rotation

839
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:16,840
on our bimani musical more program which airs 24 hours a day seven days a week on

840
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:20,420
this station when we're not here also speaking of live programming Monday

843
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:35,120

844
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:40,420

845
01:08:40,420 --> 01:08:45,580
where I just go crazy and play whatever. Although if you're in our chat room you can make a

846
01:08:45,580 --> 01:08:49,900
request and if I think that it doesn't totally suck ass I'll play it amen to

861
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:53,560
anyone's mind I don't think so moving right along I got to plug the live

862
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:57,420
journal community because we haven't plugged that in a while if you guys have

863
01:09:57,420 --> 01:10:00,040
a live journal which I know a lot of you do in this day and age we're starting to

864
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:03,680
move into a live journal a centered internet I head on over to our live

865
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:06,960

a way for you to meet other listeners of Horns Life Radio. Crazy people like us.

870
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:28,560
Let's see DDR UltraMix 2. It's been a game we've been talking about a hell of a

871
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:33,400
lot lately I gotta say but song pack I keep calling it service back song pack

872
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:38,040
7 came out this week finally a lot of us were expecting the song pack 7 was going

873
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:42,120
to be out when the game came out but for whatever reason there was a delay sounds

874
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:45,440
like there might have been some kind of bug that prevented things I don't know a

875
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:49,440
lot of people bitching and moaning because song pack 7 has a lot of old

876
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:53,560
songs in it we were talking about this a little bit last week but song pack 7 has

877
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:59,720
end of the century and Las Señorita and Silent Hill a lot of old classic DDR

878
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:04,660
songs but I guess played out to a lot of people as well era as well so you get

879
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:10,760
some tack finally and indeed your ultimate still but a lot of these these

880
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:13,040
songs since they're old they're kind of played out so they're getting a lot of

881
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:16,960
kind of negative feedback from folks out there even though I don't know I think

882
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:21,240
it's kind of neat because a you get them 60 frames a second B you can play them

883
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:26,160
on Xbox live now not that I'm a huge fan of any of the songs really I like era

884
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:31,440
don't get me wrong I love era but then there's this new remix of I feel the

885
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:34,480
junk circuit mix which is pretty interesting because junk circuit is

886
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:37,920
another artist that's over on a different drum the background for this

887
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:41,840
song has like the website address you may have noticed a lot of the different

888
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:46,660
drum songs a lot of those like the Jesper kid a lot of the a lot of the new

889
01:11:46,660 --> 01:11:49,040
songs ultra mix to have websites in their background so it's kind of

890
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:53,440
interesting that we're getting those in some of the song packs as well but I

891
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:58,240
think in visiting junk circuits website I think there's actually a lot in common

892
01:11:58,240 --> 01:12:03,280
between junk circuit and Naropa who does the song standing still in time because

893
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:09,120
they have the same website contact email so kind of interesting all right anyway

894
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:12,720
they're telling us in the chat room to stop talking about the song and play the

895
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:15,880
damn thing already that's fine we'll get to it I'm going to copy it over right

896
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:19,920
now monkeys put the finishing touches on it so we'll go ahead and play that for

897
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:22,920
But really first, Loki, what did you think of this remix?

898
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:24,920
It's better than the other one.

899
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:26,920
You didn't like the other one? Why is that?

900
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:30,920
The other one just kind of sucked. I don't know. It was just kind of, eh, not much different.

901
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:32,920
This is a lot better.

902
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:37,920
I do like this one a little bit better too, but I kind of like the old one as well, I got to admit.

903
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:39,920
So, I don't know. What do I know?

904
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:47,920
Alright. I got to copy it over.

905
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:50,920
I guess there was a big tournament on Ultramix 2 tonight, online.

906
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:54,920
There was a lot of people talking about it over on DDRFreak, I missed it.

907
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:59,920
It wasn't something, I knew I'd get my ass kicked so I didn't want to participate, but I guess it went pretty well, from what I hear.

908
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:03,920
Alright, I'll stop talking and start playing. Here it is!

909
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:08,920
Orange Launch Radio presents the brand new iFeel remix, it's the junk circuit mix. Enjoy you guys.

910
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:10,920
Do you feel it?

911
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:47,920
I sit here, I sit here.

912
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:59,920
I sit here, I sit here.

913
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:06,920
I sit here, I sit here.

914
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:24,920
Can you hear it?

915
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:34,920
Can you hear it?

916
01:14:34,920 --> 01:15:03,680
There it is, brand new here on Orange Lounge Radio.

917
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:07,680
I feel the junk circuit mix. What did you guys think of that? Some of you guys are hearing

918
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:13,080
that for the first time. Dark Sakura? Who did that again? That was junk circuit. I like

919
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:17,400
the original better. I think a lot of us can agree that the original is a little bit better.

920
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:21,440
Nothing ever tops the original. It's like when you remake old movies. Oh, Loki says

921
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:26,520
it does top the original. Well, I disagree. Nothing tops the Kiryamoga. What did you think

922
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:31,400
of that, Bradley? I liked it, except I think that the, I feel that little. Hold the bottom

923
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:06,480
Except for I think that that little computer I feel it voice is a bad touch

924
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:10,800
If they left it out and make it better jazz in our Chatham agrees with you

925
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:15,400
He says the whole can you feel it samples just sounds fucking cheesy is what he says yeah

926
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:18,040
And Jamie's yelling from the laundry room that she agrees

927
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:22,240
Yeah, no overall. I like it. Yeah. I I think it's pretty good

928
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:28,820
I I think the can you feel it is a little weird, but it I don't know it's it's different

929
01:16:28,820 --> 01:16:33,820
I give him points for trying. It's a good remix. It's a fun song to play.

930
01:16:33,820 --> 01:16:36,820
The steps are kind of interesting.

931
01:16:36,820 --> 01:16:38,820
It took something good and added a bunch of extremist crap to it.

932
01:16:38,820 --> 01:16:43,820
The steps. Is there any DDR remix that you've liked so far?

933
01:16:43,820 --> 01:16:48,820
I like the What's His Face one that you interviewed last week.

934
01:16:48,820 --> 01:16:49,820
Midihead?

935
01:16:49,820 --> 01:16:50,820
Yeah.

936
01:16:50,820 --> 01:16:51,820
Okay.

937
01:16:51,820 --> 01:16:52,820
Oh, that's good.

938
01:16:52,820 --> 01:16:54,820
Alright. Yeah, What's His Face.

939
01:16:54,820 --> 01:16:57,820
I wasn't here.

940
01:16:57,820 --> 01:17:04,440
I wasn't here. I know it. You'll get to talk to the next DDRi. We're hoping we have Midi

941
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:09,020
Head back at some point, actually. But actually, if you guys missed it, I know that right now

942
01:17:09,020 --> 01:17:14,960
he's going to, he agreed to do an interview with DDRFreak, so if you go on to the game

943
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:20,100
console games, what is that, DDR console games forum, there's a little sticky announcement

944
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:24,100
thingy where you can ask Midi Head a question. So if you missed getting your question last

945
01:17:24,100 --> 01:17:26,700
week, because we took some questions from our listeners, but if you missed your chance

946
01:17:26,700 --> 01:17:31,180
asked me to hit a question. They are taking question submissions right now, so go check

947
01:17:31,180 --> 01:17:35,080
that out if you like. What did you think of that remix, Angel? You like everything, so

948
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:38,580
I know you're going to have something good to say about it.

949
01:17:38,580 --> 01:17:45,100
Well, I liked the first one from Silent Hill when we first did that one. That one, when

950
01:17:45,100 --> 01:17:47,660
the other one came out, I liked that one. So, what do you think my answer is going to

951
01:17:47,660 --> 01:17:55,460
be this time? Come on. What do you think? Ten? Yeah. You're such a Bomani whore. I love

952
01:17:55,460 --> 01:17:56,460
it.

953
01:17:56,460 --> 01:18:10,820
I want to take some calls on the Skype line.

954
01:18:10,820 --> 01:18:15,580
If you want to give us a call, head on over to www.orangelandradio.com and click on interact

955
01:18:15,580 --> 01:18:16,580
with us.

956
01:18:16,580 --> 01:18:19,860
I'm kind of curious about some of your guys' feedback on UltraMix 2, specifically Song

957
01:18:19,860 --> 01:18:22,400
Pack 7 if you've had a chance to check it out.

958
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:26,040
Any online experiences you might have had on Ultramix 2, and even if you want to talk

959
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:29,540
about a DDR festival, because we haven't talked a whole lot about DDR festival and that's

960
01:18:29,540 --> 01:18:33,400
just because none of us in Sacr- I don't think a single person in Sacramento that I know

961
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:38,320
of anyway has bought the game, so we don't know what to say about it.

962
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:43,160
And to add to that, if you'd like to talk about Drawn Together as well, no, that's not-

963
01:18:43,160 --> 01:19:10,160
The house has been rearranged in Halo 2 land position.

964
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:14,560
I have no room to put any dance pads or anything.

965
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:15,560
Look at this place.

966
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:16,560
Hello.

967
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:17,560
You can sit on our dance.

968
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:18,560
You have infinitely more room.

969
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:19,560
Dance got the...

970
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:26,080
Normally in my living room we have the TV on one wall, the couch on one wall, and the

971
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:28,240
loveseat back on the far wall.

972
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:33,600
Now the loveseat and couch are back to back with just enough room to have a place to put

973
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:36,680
your legs in an Xbox between TVs.

974
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:38,840
It is currently in LAN mode.

975
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:42,080
Are you guys hosting a bunch of Halo 2 parties or something?

976
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:44,000
Dan did on his birthday on Monday.

977
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,200
Oh, his birthday was Monday, huh?

978
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:46,200
Yeah.

979
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:47,200
Happy birthday, Dan.

980
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:48,200
I wasn't here for that.

981
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:49,200
Oh.

982
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:51,200
He told me I should feel guilty.

983
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:55,200
Oh, now that's not true.

984
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:57,200
That's not true.

985
01:19:57,200 --> 01:20:02,080
Well, I don't think anybody's calling us on the Skyline, so what can we do?

986
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:03,400
Dan, I think so.

987
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:07,080
Except now they're talking about drawing together in our chat room.

988
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:14,500
freaking ass, Loki. Jerk. Loki, now you keep telling me that you're going to start playing

989
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:18,100
UltraMix 2, because I notice that every time I've been playing it, you're like, yeah, I

990
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:22,700
need to play that. Yeah, I need to play that. Are you actually going to be playing? Oh,

991
01:20:22,700 --> 01:20:27,420
we're finally getting a call. You're on, you get a reprieve for now, but as soon as this

992
01:20:27,420 --> 01:20:30,600
call's done, we're going to ask you about that. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

993
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:34,520
Legend Zaku here. Hi Zaku, how are you?

994
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:38,000
Well, I don't have that much to share because, you know,

995
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,360
as I said, you know, I'm a college student. Then get off the phone!

996
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:45,840
No, I'm kidding. I don't have a PS2 or an Xbox. I might get one this Christmas, but I'm kinda

997
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:49,600
iffy on which one should I get. You know, Bamani-wise, that is.

998
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:54,520
So you don't have a PS2 or an Xbox. You're asking the age-old question, which

999
01:20:54,520 --> 01:20:55,640
system should I get?

1000
01:20:55,640 --> 01:20:59,360
No, but in regards to not only, you know, games, but also Bamani

1001
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:03,360
as well. I'm adding a little kick to it.

1002
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:06,360
And you have nothing to add about drawn together.

1003
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:07,360
He didn't hear that one.

1004
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:09,360
And you have nothing to add about drawn together.

1005
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:12,360
I did see South Park last Wednesday, but that was about it.

1006
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:16,360
No, no, no. Quit trying to derail this program, Loki, Zaku, Shane.

1007
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:22,360
All right. As far as Xbox versus PS2, here it is basically.

1008
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:27,360
If you're interested in something that's going to remind you of the arcade,

1009
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:30,720
gonna bring you the arcade experience to the home something where there's a lot

1010
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:34,520
of different songs available something with itoy support if you want to get

1011
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:39,120
your hands involved go for the ps2 if you want to get something where you can

1012
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:43,400
play online and you want to play against other people that live around go for the

1013
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:46,800
Xbox but here's the thing you being the starving college student that means

1014
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:49,520
you're gonna have to pay for the Xbox Xbox Live and then five bucks a song

1015
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:55,480
pack so I don't know what what are you looking at also with the ps2 I might

1016
01:21:55,480 --> 01:21:59,740
I have to mod it. I have to mod it if I'm going to play 2DX or any of those lovely but

1017
01:21:59,740 --> 01:22:01,300
modded games besides CD-R.

1018
01:22:01,300 --> 01:22:04,900
Well, that's very true, and then that's going to cost you money as well. I mean, if you

1019
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:08,740
want to play the Japanese game. And that's the other thing. If you plan on modding your

1020
01:22:08,740 --> 01:22:14,060
PS2, which, you know, can have mixed results, I guess I hear now it's a pretty easy mod.

1021
01:22:14,060 --> 01:22:18,300
I live in the city. I live in the city. Chinatown's not that far, and I can always get it modded

1022
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:19,300
there.

1023
01:22:19,300 --> 01:22:21,660
Alright, alright. Fair enough. So you can get a modded PS2. So if you're interested

1024
01:22:21,660 --> 01:22:25,220
in 2DX or Poppin' or any of that stuff, you're definitely going to want to get the PS2.

1025
01:22:25,220 --> 01:22:34,220
Here's the other thing to consider, too. We have PS3 and Xbox2 likely to be out in stores before next Christmas.

1026
01:22:34,220 --> 01:22:39,220
We don't know for sure, but if I were a betting man, I would say those things are going to be in stores next Christmas,

1027
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:46,220
which means the systems that are out there now, their prices will be halved, or they'll be $100 or less.

1028
01:22:46,220 --> 01:22:54,220
Yeah, I probably already took notice of that, and I think 9th Style, if it does come out next year for PS2,

1029
01:22:54,220 --> 01:22:58,940
I don't know if it's going to jump into the next console or just be the last PS2 2DX game.

1030
01:22:58,940 --> 01:23:03,900
I'm kind of hoping that there is a 9th style and a 10th style pretty back-to-back.

1031
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:06,420
I'm kind of hoping that those games come out pretty quickly.

1032
01:23:06,420 --> 01:23:10,460
PS2 or just one for PS2 and the next for PS3.

1033
01:23:10,460 --> 01:23:12,220
I hope they both come out.

1034
01:23:12,220 --> 01:23:19,900
I think it's a given that PS3 will play PS2 games, so they ought to just both come out for PS2.

1035
01:23:19,900 --> 01:23:28,900
Yeah, seeing as, you know, I already noticed that 2DX games come out, you know, there's always 2DX games coming out for PS2 every single year.

1036
01:23:28,900 --> 01:23:36,900
And basically, from what I'm speculating, from what I'm predicting, 9th Style might come out in May next year or something, or near the summer.

1037
01:23:36,900 --> 01:23:38,900
Who knows? Nobody really knows.

1038
01:23:38,900 --> 01:23:39,900
I'm taking a guess here.

1039
01:23:39,900 --> 01:23:40,900
Yeah, you're taking a shot.

1040
01:23:40,900 --> 01:23:42,900
I'm taking an educated guess from...

1041
01:23:42,900 --> 01:23:46,900
But, you know, alright, I think pretty much I...

1042
01:23:46,900 --> 01:23:53,900
You know what? Then again, 9th style would make a lot of sense on Playstation 3, because then they could fuck up the timing.

1043
01:23:53,900 --> 01:23:56,900
Try putting it on a new system, just like the arcade ones.

1044
01:23:56,900 --> 01:24:07,900
And if I get a PS2 for Bomani, I'm going to have to pay money for the 2DX controller, Pop'n Music, so that's going to be equally the same if I'm going to try going after both.

1045
01:24:07,900 --> 01:24:14,900
Because one will have more peripherals, and the other will have more services and things to buy.

1046
01:24:14,900 --> 01:24:19,220
Now, also to even confuse things even more, there's also the Phantom console that's coming

1047
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:26,500
out and, um, the, how is that confusing? Who gives a shit about the Phantom? Seriously?

1048
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:32,540
What the, what's that? Exactly, exactly. Hey, I've got pictures of the drill on orange

1049
01:24:32,540 --> 01:24:38,420
on radio dot com. And I hear rumors, I hear rumors of the, um, N-Gage 2 that's shaped

1050
01:24:38,420 --> 01:24:50,420
like a banana. I have rumors of a foul movement I'm about to have after this show. Here's

1051
01:24:50,420 --> 01:24:53,380
the thing though, if you're looking for a Bomani, a system for a Bomani, don't get a

1052
01:24:53,380 --> 01:24:59,780
GameCube. Of course not, hell no. GameCubes are not worth the money. Hey, don't you be

1053
01:24:59,780 --> 01:25:04,260
knocking the GameCube, it's a beautiful system. I'm not knocking them. I mean, it's cheap,

1054
01:25:04,260 --> 01:25:07,380
but I mean, there's no Bomani. Don't make me come out there and cut you, because I will.

1055
01:25:07,380 --> 01:25:12,460
What, you're going to travel 3,000 miles? To cut you? To cut you, yes.

1056
01:25:12,460 --> 01:25:16,860
Do you even know where in New York do I live? I'll send my minions.

1057
01:25:16,860 --> 01:25:18,320
Yeah, sure.

1058
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:21,440
And then do you want a cookie for that guy?

1059
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:22,700
We can track your IP!

1060
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:23,640
That's right.

1061
01:25:23,640 --> 01:25:28,000
Yeah. Live 365 has it all on record, I think.

1062
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:31,520
Sure it does. What IP and what school am I going...

1063
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:36,380
Am I doing this properly? You're going to the school of hang up in about five seconds there, buddy.

1064
01:25:36,380 --> 01:25:37,880
Thanks a lot, thanks a lot, Sky.

1065
01:25:37,880 --> 01:25:38,880
Alright, you're welcome.

1066
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:39,880
Now I know what to...

1067
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:40,880
Take care, Zaku.

1068
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:41,880
Yeah, alright.

1069
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:42,880
Bye.

1070
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:48,880
Now I know what to choose later.

1071
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:53,560
Zaku's always fun to talk to.

1072
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:55,440
I like bullying him a little bit.

1073
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:56,440
He's fun.

1074
01:25:56,440 --> 01:25:57,440
He's a fun guy.

1075
01:25:57,440 --> 01:25:58,440
Alright.

1076
01:25:58,440 --> 01:25:59,720
We're gonna go do the Orange Launch Radio Cage Match.

1077
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:04,520
We gotta get into that.

1078
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:11,440
week in the Orange Launch Radio cage match. Loki was the winner, but it doesn't matter

1079
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:16,800
because that was a one-time thing, so that gets thrown out and we go back to the cage

1080
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:21,160
match at hand. Our reoccurring winner, Gwen Stefani, What You Waiting For? It's a song

1081
01:26:21,160 --> 01:26:26,080
I put in the cage match, believe it or not, three weeks ago. So because it won last week

1082
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:31,560
by default, this is the last time it can win. And if it wins tonight, it'll become the second

1083
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:35,560
We're gonna play three songs for you guys, one song from each host. We only have one song in Orange Lounge History to be retired from the Cage Match, so we'll see.

1084
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:39,560
Alright, we'll see. Loki seems convinced it's gonna be gone.

1085
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:43,560
Jamie, you have something you wanna say?

1086
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:47,560
Thank you. What a woman.

1087
01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:51,560
Alright, here we go. Here's a clip of last- oh yeah, the way the Cage Match works.

1088
01:26:51,560 --> 01:26:55,560
You gotta be in our chat room, you gotta be listening live on Sunday night.

1089
01:26:55,560 --> 01:26:59,560
www.orangetownstrated.com, click on chat. We're gonna play three songs for you guys,

1090
01:26:59,560 --> 01:27:01,260
One song from each host.

1091
01:27:01,260 --> 01:27:05,320
We only play a clip of last week's winner though, because you already heard the song

1092
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:08,840
back when it first won, because you listen to Orange Lounge Radio every week, right?

1093
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:09,840
Right?

1094
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:14,860

You know it all by heart, why are you standing in one place?

1105
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:05,680
A moon to blast, a moon to carry

01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:08,680
You're moving in and out cause of your search for a new zone

You've entered a million dollar contract

01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:34,480
And they're all waiting for your heart track

1114

Talking about combining different groups.

1127
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:39,760
emerge so put in the original instead just because I really wanted to play it

1128
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:43,140
and I don't care if it was or not all right I think the lesson I did was

1129
01:29:43,140 --> 01:29:48,780
that so this is the Fisher Spooner with emerge Fisher Spooner with emerge the

You don't need to be much from nothing You don't need to step up with

1135
01:31:46,780 --> 01:31:59,780
Feels good, looks good, sounds good, looks good, feels good too

He was good too, all that's right He was good too, all that's right

1137
01:32:07,780 --> 01:32:32,780
You don't need to think English on your own, you don't need to share a word You don't need

1138
01:32:32,780 --> 01:32:37,780
The English was nothing, you don't give a shit about it

1139
01:32:37,780 --> 01:32:39,780
You don't need me

1140
01:32:39,780 --> 01:32:41,780
You are so nothing

1141
01:32:41,780 --> 01:32:44,780
You don't need to get away

1142
01:32:44,780 --> 01:32:45,780
You don't need me

1143
01:32:45,780 --> 01:32:47,780
You are so nothing

1144
01:33:17,780 --> 01:33:36,460
Uh huh, that's right Uh huh, that's right

1145
01:33:36,460 --> 01:33:38,860
Any paid attention

1146
01:33:49,460 --> 01:33:51,060
You don't need to

1147
01:33:51,060 --> 01:33:52,860
Yeah, one girl, I think

1148
01:33:52,860 --> 01:33:54,260
You don't need to

1149
01:33:54,260 --> 01:33:55,660
Go alone

1150
01:33:56,060 --> 01:33:57,460
You don't need to

1151
01:33:57,860 --> 01:33:59,460
Yeah, one girl, I think

1152
01:33:59,460 --> 01:34:00,460
You don't need to

1153
01:34:00,460 --> 01:34:02,260
Go alone

1154
01:34:02,460 --> 01:34:03,860
You don't need to

1155
01:34:03,860 --> 01:34:05,460
Yeah, one girl, I think

1156
01:34:35,460 --> 01:34:41,860
We don't want it, we don't want nothing, we are being careful

1157
01:35:05,460 --> 01:35:10,820
the nine for me but i don't really care an apathetic nine from dark sakura

1158
01:35:10,820 --> 01:35:16,100
seriously i just put it in just because i wanted to listen to it that's a good enough reason as any

1159
01:35:16,100 --> 01:35:22,820
uh arcadian see if that mic will work again for you no is it it's on there we go okay yes

1160
01:35:23,620 --> 01:35:28,580
uh it's all right no i don't really like it all that much so i'll give it a six

1161
01:35:28,580 --> 01:35:30,580
a six from Markidian. Uh, Loki!

1162
01:35:32,580 --> 01:35:34,580
I didn't get it.

1163
01:35:34,580 --> 01:35:36,580
Was that supposed to be a song?

1164
01:35:36,580 --> 01:35:40,580
Because it sounded just like some stupid synth in the background and talking over it.

1165
01:35:40,580 --> 01:35:42,580
So I don't get it.

1166
01:35:42,580 --> 01:35:46,580
I'm trying to go- it sounds like a Beck-type thing, but no.

1167
01:35:46,580 --> 01:35:48,580
No.

1168
01:35:48,580 --> 01:35:51,580
I can't imagine this being actually better than the original remix.

1169
01:35:51,580 --> 01:35:54,580
Of course I don't remember that remix of it, so um...

1170
01:35:54,580 --> 01:36:00,820
I get the one sorry I you know what I actually dig the sense in that song

1171
01:36:00,820 --> 01:36:04,300
quite a bit it's I see that it's kind of like maybe a song I would listen to all

1172
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:07,700
I'm driving home late at night it's pretty cool and it's got a very much of

1173
01:36:07,700 --> 01:36:11,780
an 80s vibe going for me my only complaint is that the little quiet I'd

1174
01:36:11,780 --> 01:36:15,660
like something maybe a little bit more driving but I actually like to say I

1175
01:36:15,660 --> 01:36:19,060
like I've become a total synth pop horror lately and yes a lot of that has

1176
01:36:19,060 --> 01:36:22,360
to do with ultra mix too so that song kind of fits in for me so I'm giving it

1177
01:36:22,360 --> 01:36:32,360
at 8. Angel? I liked it a lot, I'll give it an 8. Alright, remember it doesn't matter

1178
01:36:32,360 --> 01:36:37,240
what we think though, it's all up to you guys. But you get a third song to pick from tonight,

1179
01:36:37,240 --> 01:36:42,360
and Loki is being cheap tonight, let's hear what he's going to pick. Thank you for the

1180
01:36:42,360 --> 01:36:48,520
introduction. Now this song, as we already heard, it was last week, we played it. This

1181
01:36:48,520 --> 01:36:56,520
This is their cover of The Fix, Midi Head, with Deeper and Deeper, or Monolithic, whatever.

1182
01:36:56,520 --> 01:36:58,520
Actually, it's Monolithic, but yeah.

1183
01:36:58,520 --> 01:37:00,520
Alright, so here it is, song number three tonight.

1184
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:07,520
a cover of The Fix with Monolithic with Deeper and Deeper. Enjoy, we'll be back.

1185
01:37:30,520 --> 01:37:58,520
I'm talkin' about skill in the tomb, no I don't

1186
01:37:58,520 --> 01:38:02,520
I'm talkin' about, screw the show, when they're all letting go

1187
01:38:02,520 --> 01:38:06,520
Take a look at the wits, see the touch on her eyes, tell me what does she feel

1188
01:38:06,520 --> 01:38:10,520
This is the way of the world, let's take a look at the girls, show them how it looks real

1189
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:14,520
And I see the edge, I look, I fall

1190
01:38:14,520 --> 01:38:19,520
I get deeper, and deeper

1191
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:21,520
The more I see, the more I fall

1192
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:26,520
Nobody finds me when I take the call, I get deeper, and deeper

1193
01:38:56,520 --> 01:38:59,520
Once I see me, hey, hey, I'm a-gonna take a picture

1194
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:03,040
Can I see the edge? I look out for

1195
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:07,520
Like it's deeper, it's deeper

1196
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:09,520
The more I see, the more I fall

1197
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:11,280
The way time can really save the call

1198
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:15,520
I get deeper, it's deeper

1199
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:21,520
Ah, ah, ah, ah, I see the edge, I look out for

1200
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:23,520
The place to hide, better take a call

1201
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:25,240
I see the edge

1202
01:39:25,240 --> 01:39:27,240
I see the end of the world

1203
01:39:27,240 --> 01:39:29,240
I don't see the end

1204
01:39:29,240 --> 01:39:31,240
It's time to go take it all

1205
01:39:39,240 --> 01:39:41,240
This is the way of the world

1206
01:39:41,240 --> 01:39:43,240
Deep Earth

1207
01:39:47,240 --> 01:39:49,240
This is the way of the world

1208
01:39:49,240 --> 01:39:51,240
Deep Earth

1209
01:39:51,240 --> 01:39:53,240
When they're already gone

1210
01:40:23,240 --> 01:40:30,240
I'm talking about the scale of the show, no I don't

1211
01:40:30,240 --> 01:40:37,240
I'm talking about the scale of the show, when they're all letting go

1212
01:40:37,240 --> 01:40:44,240
Take a look at the wind, see the smoke in her eyes, tell me what is it real

1213
01:40:44,240 --> 01:40:49,240
Is this the way of the world, is it a boy or a girl, is it all a lie or a thrill

1214
01:40:49,240 --> 01:41:03,920
And I see the edge, I look, I fall, I get deeper, and deeper, the more I see, the more

1215
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:18,920
I fall, the later I see, when I take the call, I get deeper, and deeper, I see the edge,

1216
01:41:18,920 --> 01:41:20,920
Foul

1217
01:41:20,920 --> 01:41:22,920
There's no place to hide

1218
01:41:22,920 --> 01:41:48,600
I can't make a reference, Jamie what did you think?

1219
01:41:48,600 --> 01:41:52,600
I liked everything about the song except for the guy's voice.

1220
01:41:52,600 --> 01:41:56,600
So it gets, uh...

1221
01:41:56,600 --> 01:42:00,600
Well, damn, the music gets a ten, the voice gets a one.

1222
01:42:00,600 --> 01:42:04,600
So...

1223
01:42:04,600 --> 01:42:08,600
Loki says it gets an eleven.

1224
01:42:08,600 --> 01:42:12,600
Seven. Only because of the voice.

1225
01:42:12,600 --> 01:42:16,600
Can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you.

1226
01:42:16,600 --> 01:42:25,120
a nine from Bradley Loki it gets a 10 and if you like this go to MIDI head

1227
01:42:25,120 --> 01:42:29,080
calm by his album and then tell them that orange laundry you sent you you'll

1228
01:42:29,080 --> 01:42:34,000
get access to this wonderful song as well as many other remixes he's done I

1229
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:39,600
should listen to that song quite a bit on my new iPod lately so I I have to

1230
01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:45,100
miss it's actually a really good song I just hope we don't he doesn't turn into

1231
01:42:45,100 --> 01:42:51,300
the new echo image on this station seriously no but actually it's a great

1232
01:42:51,300 --> 01:42:58,600

that song all right all right guys you're gonna place your vote momentarily

1235
01:43:13,660 --> 01:43:17,860
But first, here is a recap of the three songs you can vote for tonight.

1236
01:43:17,860 --> 01:43:29,580

1237
01:43:29,580 --> 01:43:49,780

And we will see what happens.

1243
01:44:19,880 --> 01:44:24,000
Alright moving right along.

1244
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:28,680
I've been perusing some of the message forums out there lately, DDRfreak namely being one

1245
01:44:28,680 --> 01:44:29,680
of them.

1246
01:44:29,680 --> 01:44:32,920
I thought there was this very interesting thread over there in Random Chat.

1247
01:44:32,920 --> 01:44:36,080
You know how they do a lot of like really crazy stuff over in Random Chat?

1248
01:44:36,080 --> 01:44:37,960
You know the Random Chat stuff, right?

1249
01:44:37,960 --> 01:44:39,460
Right, DarkSakura?

1250
01:44:39,460 --> 01:44:42,460
Being a mod over there and everything?

1251
01:44:42,460 --> 01:44:43,460
Yes.

1252
01:44:43,460 --> 01:44:45,960
What's this random that you talk about?

1253
01:44:45,960 --> 01:44:49,000
We don't know anything about random on this show.

1254
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:53,960
Just out of curiosity, this is total tangent, but since I'm thinking DarkSakura here in

1255
01:44:53,960 --> 01:44:58,880
how much she loves to lock topics over there. What would you say would be the most favorite

1256
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:09,520
topic you've gotten to lock on Random Chat? Hi, please lock this. Yes, I've had a please

1257
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:18,240
lock this before. Hi, please lock this. Alright. There's an interesting topic going on there

1258
01:45:18,240 --> 01:45:22,340
in Random Chat. It's called, do you actually play DDR anymore? And I thought it was kind

1259
01:45:22,340 --> 01:45:27,740
of interesting, just seeing how many people actually don't play DDR anymore. So I kind

1260
01:45:27,740 --> 01:45:33,580
of was going to go around the room a little bit and see, do you play DDR anymore? And

1261
01:45:33,580 --> 01:45:40,660
if not, why are you doing this show? Because I have a creative, I'll start. Do I play DDR

1262
01:45:40,660 --> 01:45:44,480
anymore? A little bit, not as much nearly as I used to. I play a little bit of Ultra

1263
01:45:44,480 --> 01:45:50,260
Mix 2 at home. Most of my DDR playing is controller controller. The reason why I don't play DDR

1264
01:45:50,260 --> 01:45:54,620
much anymore is because the quality of arcades in this area went downhill significantly.

1265
01:45:54,620 --> 01:45:58,660
Konami of Japan can suck it for not putting out a new mix in a long time, I think that

1266
01:45:58,660 --> 01:46:04,100
has a lot to do with the reason why I haven't played DDR in a long time. The home versions

1267
01:46:04,100 --> 01:46:09,140
are the only thing keeping it alive to me, but I just can't motivate my fat ass to pull

1268
01:46:09,140 --> 01:46:13,140
out the ignition pad, especially when the ignition pad, as good of a dance pad as it

1269
01:46:13,140 --> 01:46:19,180
is, it's still not the arcade. I want to play DDR in the arcade, and there's no good arcade

1270
01:46:19,180 --> 01:46:23,780
and yes I realized there was that step mania thing but to me it's it's still

1271
01:46:23,780 --> 01:46:28,820
only 90% and it and it the damn thing broke in a week anyway and it's still

1272
01:46:28,820 --> 01:46:36,500
not everything that DDR is it still got issues and in the groove it's okay but

1273
01:46:36,500 --> 01:46:43,620
yeah just you know ego killed the video game star I guess uh Dark Sakura do you

1274
01:46:43,620 --> 01:46:49,540
play DDR anymore? I played DDR when I was in Alabama. Well, there you go. Do you play

1275
01:46:49,540 --> 01:46:54,740
it regularly besides that? When I'm somewhere that has a machine, I'll play. I've got more

1276
01:46:54,740 --> 01:47:00,260
reason to play now than I go play Doc at RVGL. Thus, I'd add a little bit of money and go

1277
01:47:00,260 --> 01:47:04,580
play some DDR. I played like one game of DDR when I went to go play Doc at Derby Owners

1278
01:47:04,580 --> 01:47:08,680
Club over at Rosewood Golf Land, but here's the problem. I fucking failed Breakdown. Now,

1279
01:47:08,680 --> 01:47:11,860
you know, it's a nine-footer. It's a more difficult song at the end of the scale, but

1280
01:47:11,860 --> 01:47:17,860
But you have to remember, I'm somebody who was playing DDR religiously for quite some time, and, you know, I...

1281
01:47:17,860 --> 01:47:23,860
It just makes me sad how much stamina I've lost, you know?

1282
01:47:23,860 --> 01:47:26,860
Arkadian, do you actually play DDR anymore?

1283
01:47:26,860 --> 01:47:34,860
Not really, just mainly because my foot's been hurting, because I haven't had that much money lately.

1284
01:47:34,860 --> 01:47:43,220
No, I might be able to go once my foot feels 100% or 90% at least, and maybe more in the future.

1285
01:47:43,220 --> 01:47:48,300
Because it's been so long and I need to get off my fat ass and I sit around too much.

1286
01:47:48,300 --> 01:47:50,700
And so on.

1287
01:47:50,700 --> 01:47:53,500
Loki, do you play DDR anymore?

1288
01:47:53,500 --> 01:47:58,020
Is DDR in Final Fantasy XI?

1289
01:47:58,020 --> 01:47:59,860
A DICKED!

1290
01:47:59,860 --> 01:48:04,860
Yes, I do, on StepMania. Every once in a while, I'll play it.

1291
01:48:04,860 --> 01:48:11,860
But, yes, to answer your question earlier about you, you know, Xbox and stuff, and if I was ever going to play it,

1292
01:48:11,860 --> 01:48:15,860
no, because I'm going to actually set up my StepMania cabinet to be playing this stuff.

1293
01:48:15,860 --> 01:48:21,860
In fact, that's why I bought crap today to cut the other control panel for the actual, you know, select arrows and stuff.

1294
01:48:21,860 --> 01:48:26,860
That's why I was going to do that today. I'm hopefully going to build that this week,

1295
01:48:26,860 --> 01:48:33,860
a while back, a new, um, IPAC thing to hook it all up, and I have to see if it's gonna get fried as easy as the other one.

1296
01:48:33,860 --> 01:48:38,860
So, it's all on, uh, contingent on that, whether I get to play it some more.

1297
01:48:38,860 --> 01:48:48,860
And I'm playing the arcade, cause the arcade's too far away, takes too much of my time, cuts into my Final Fantasy XI time, and, um, the arcade's broken all the time.

1298
01:48:48,860 --> 01:48:54,860
I'm not in a way fucking out of shape. I go and play, like, a seven-footer on doubles, and I'm ready to die.

1299
01:48:54,860 --> 01:49:01,020
die. I mean, whatever happened to me? That's what I want to know. It never used to be this

1300
01:49:01,020 --> 01:49:05,900
hard. But once I get back in shape, yeah, I play a lot more. I just need to finish my

1301
01:49:05,900 --> 01:49:13,380
arcade cabinet before I move out of here, so that's priority one.

1302
01:49:13,380 --> 01:49:19,080
You don't play a whole lot of DDR in the arcade or at home anymore, yet you're very gung-ho

1303
01:49:19,080 --> 01:49:24,200
about this cabinet and everything. Why do you think that is? Is it just a love for the

1304
01:49:24,200 --> 01:49:29,420
basic concept of the game or? I like building stuff, have you noticed? Stuff that doesn't

1305
01:49:29,420 --> 01:49:35,780
work. Like the portal to hell. For example, the portal to hell. Also I noticed you tend

1306
01:49:35,780 --> 01:49:40,220
to build things halfway through and don't finish them. Such as these lovely metal pads

1307
01:49:40,220 --> 01:49:45,380
that have been sitting over here for the past. The pads are done. Can we play Xbox or PS2

1308
01:49:45,380 --> 01:49:51,420
games with them right now? We can if I hooked up the other, the umm, I pack thing because

1309
01:49:51,420 --> 01:49:54,780
all I have to do is switch out the old iPack and it plugs right in and it works. But the

1310
01:49:54,780 --> 01:50:01,420
thing is, the thing is I haven't bought the adapter for the Xbox or the PS2 yet because

1311
01:50:01,420 --> 01:50:07,580
it was hooked up directly to my computer. But yes I could. I could if I wanted to. It

1312
01:50:07,580 --> 01:50:12,220
just would take a while because I'd have to wire everything. But it's just that those

1313
01:50:12,220 --> 01:50:16,820
things, I would be curious how thick the layer of dust is on those metal pads that are sitting

1314
01:50:16,820 --> 01:50:23,600
right there. Can I go, can I go wipe my finger on it and see how much dust is on them? Here

1315
01:50:23,600 --> 01:50:36,600
you go, Loki. They also buy the air intake, just so you know. Oh yeah, okay, I have an

1316
01:50:36,600 --> 01:50:41,560
idea. Let me wipe the dust off of my little, my computer desk here, because I get quite

1317
01:50:41,560 --> 01:50:45,920
a bit used to that. Oh look, it's gray. Let me wipe the dust off of every, there's dust

1318
01:50:45,920 --> 01:50:51,380
anywhere in here. It's not a surprise that there's dust on those. That and they're right

1319
01:50:51,380 --> 01:50:56,060
next to the air intake, which I'm sure is not good for the air conditioner one bit,

1320
01:50:56,060 --> 01:51:01,200
but that's all right. No wonder it smells like wood in this house all the time, this

1321
01:51:01,200 --> 01:51:06,500
strange mix of metal and everything. All right, explicit. Welcome to the show, by the way.

1322
01:51:06,500 --> 01:51:09,780
I noticed you just ran in there. Put down the DS for a minute. Quit chatting with Angel

1323
01:51:09,780 --> 01:51:13,740
pick a chat for a minute all right that Mike's been giving us yeah they are like

1324
01:51:13,740 --> 01:51:20,100
what eight feet what the hell this is what I think we're exchanging special

1325
01:51:20,100 --> 01:51:27,100
pictures this is wrong people you need to talk talk to talk II just like you

1326
01:51:27,100 --> 01:51:32,300
know the people I am in each other when they're sitting in a cafe talk they're

1327
01:51:32,300 --> 01:51:37,620
they're riding a penis back and forth to each other no Rob that's you last night

1328
01:51:37,620 --> 01:51:38,620
Thank you.

1329
01:51:38,620 --> 01:51:39,620
Thank you.

1330
01:51:39,620 --> 01:51:42,300
You got to hold the mic at the bottom, because it's going out tonight.

1331
01:51:42,300 --> 01:51:43,300
That mic's on its last legs.

1332
01:51:43,300 --> 01:51:44,300
Can you hear me now?

1333
01:51:44,300 --> 01:51:45,300
Yes, I can hear you now.

1334
01:51:45,300 --> 01:51:46,300
Do you play DDR?

1335
01:51:46,300 --> 01:51:48,300
Well, since there's been tournaments and stuff, and some new people want me to come back again,

1336
01:51:48,300 --> 01:51:49,300
I guess I'll play again.

1337
01:51:49,300 --> 01:51:50,300
Well, even though the DDR scene is dying in a way, because there hasn't been any releases

1338
01:51:50,300 --> 01:51:51,300
for the arcades and stuff, I just totally understand the world.

1339
01:51:51,300 --> 01:51:52,300
But it's just the new people, the community, the new members are just trying to get released

1340
01:51:52,300 --> 01:52:01,300
Well even though the DDR scene is dying in a way, because there has been any releases for the arcades and stuff, you just totally understand the world.

1341
01:52:01,300 --> 01:52:08,300
But it's just the new people, the community, the new members are just trying to get, bringing it back again in a way.

1342
01:52:08,300 --> 01:52:12,300
You give me $100,000, I'll bring back DDR. I'm telling you.

1343
01:52:12,300 --> 01:52:16,300
The only way you can bring back DDR is by fixing the stand-media cabinet, dammit.

1344
01:52:16,300 --> 01:52:17,300
Damn it.

1345
01:52:17,300 --> 01:52:18,300
Fuck that, Kevin.

1346
01:52:18,300 --> 01:52:19,300
Give me $100,000.

1347
01:52:19,300 --> 01:52:23,620
Hell, give me just $20,000 and I'll bring it back.

1348
01:52:23,620 --> 01:52:24,620
Don't you think that...

1349
01:52:24,620 --> 01:52:27,980
Now, call me crazy because it's not supposed to be DDR, quote, unquote, but don't you think

1350
01:52:27,980 --> 01:52:30,060
In the Groove was sort of a way to try to bring DDR back?

1351
01:52:30,060 --> 01:52:32,780
That's why I always got the impression that In the Groove was...

1352
01:52:32,780 --> 01:52:34,980
Even though it's not DDR.

1353
01:52:34,980 --> 01:52:39,980
Well, the thing about In the Groove is that not many cabinets have been sold around the

1354
01:52:39,980 --> 01:52:43,260
U.S. just yet, and very few songs are in it.

1355
01:52:43,260 --> 01:52:48,260
It's mainly just testing the waters until the groove 2 comes out and stuff.

1356
01:52:48,260 --> 01:52:55,260
And it also depends on what step makers are they going to hire and what songs they're going to put in it.

1357
01:52:55,260 --> 01:53:01,260
Hell, they put UltraMix in the DDR camp and I play it.

1358
01:53:01,260 --> 01:53:04,260
The first week after UltraMix 2 is out, I put the call out on the show.

1359
01:53:04,260 --> 01:53:08,260
I said, we need to hound the shit out of Konami of Hawaii and however it has to happen.

1360
01:53:08,260 --> 01:53:13,500
to happen. I don't care if some arcade division went under or what the shit happened. I don't

1361
01:53:13,500 --> 01:53:17,180
care how it has to happen. It just needs to happen. Hawaii needs to make a new arcade

1362
01:53:17,180 --> 01:53:22,180
mix. End of story. I don't care who's gotta be blown, who's gotta be paid the money. Make

1363
01:53:22,180 --> 01:53:27,640
it happen. You know what's hella funny though? The hella companies are saying that the whole

1364
01:53:27,640 --> 01:53:33,500
arcade business is dying. Unless you're trying to do like this car system like Tekken 5 and

1365
01:53:33,500 --> 01:53:35,900
or Midnight Tuner, or Initial D.

1366
01:53:35,900 --> 01:53:38,220
Yeah, but the lines for Tekken 5? Insane.

1367
01:53:38,220 --> 01:53:43,420
Honestly. You can't say Tekken 5 is not, I mean, despite how you feel about the Tekken series,

1368
01:53:43,420 --> 01:53:46,580
it's, you know, the biggest crowd I've seen in an arcade in a long time.

1369
01:53:46,580 --> 01:53:49,900
I have no clue.

1370
01:53:49,900 --> 01:53:55,740
You know, that's just like people saying, oh, well, you know, internet's killing the telephones.

1371
01:53:55,740 --> 01:53:58,540
People still use the telephones, just like people use the internet.

1372
01:53:58,540 --> 01:54:01,660
Yes, people still use the telephone, and I talk to them.

1373
01:54:01,660 --> 01:54:02,300
Sorry.

1374
01:54:02,300 --> 01:54:28,300
The reason why I pump it up is making more and more money just building new machines and stuff.

1375
01:54:28,300 --> 01:54:35,060
me to be the first to offer sex to anyone at Konami of Hawaii if you can make yourselves

1376
01:54:35,060 --> 01:54:40,580
a new DDR game. You know what? Not the Konami of Japan does a bad job, so if they want to

1377
01:54:40,580 --> 01:54:46,700
do a new mix, I'm perfectly fine with that as well. I will extend my sex offer to Konami

1378
01:54:46,700 --> 01:54:52,020
of Tokyo as well, case said. So just make me a new DDR and I will put out. It's that

1379
01:54:52,020 --> 01:54:56,580
simple. Anybody else care to offer their sexual favors?

1380
01:54:56,580 --> 01:55:00,580
No favors.

1381
01:55:00,580 --> 01:55:02,580
This is what's pissing me off. They're like,

1382
01:55:02,580 --> 01:55:05,580
Oh, this is too expensive to license songs here in America.

1383
01:55:05,580 --> 01:55:07,580
That's why we can't do it.

1384
01:55:07,580 --> 01:55:11,580
Do all in-house music. You have like, what, like five different series of culprits?

1385
01:55:11,580 --> 01:55:14,580
Or do what you've been doing for years.

1386
01:55:14,580 --> 01:55:17,580
License the song in Japan and then let the machines come over here.

1387
01:55:17,580 --> 01:55:20,580
That's what they've been doing for years.

1388
01:55:20,580 --> 01:55:23,580
Because it's cheaper to license the songs in Japan, obviously.

1389
01:55:23,580 --> 01:55:27,660
look a little weird but like I made this machine over here in Japan it's called a

1390
01:55:27,660 --> 01:55:37,020
DDR Extreme USA but it's not meant to be played in the United States just they

1391
01:55:37,020 --> 01:55:41,420
could call they could call it DDR shit mix and I'd still play it I'm sorry

1392
01:55:41,420 --> 01:55:52,220
shitake they could call it DDR shitake mix I would still play it angel you

1393
01:55:52,220 --> 01:55:55,980
still play DDR at all? You're probably more into DDR than anyone I know right now, so

1394
01:55:55,980 --> 01:56:02,980
I have to ask you this. Oh, yeah. In fact, I'm probably gonna break down and get a dual-platform

1395
01:56:02,980 --> 01:56:09,980
Ignition, because I want to play on Xbox Live. So, yeah, I'm looking into getting both of

1396
01:56:10,700 --> 01:56:17,700
those this week, UltraMix 2 and NewPad, because Magus is dying anyway, so I might as well

1397
01:56:17,700 --> 01:56:20,700
We'll just replace it, and then we can play doubles and stuff.

1398
01:56:20,700 --> 01:56:21,700
It's cool.

1399
01:56:21,700 --> 01:56:25,700
All right, speaking of ignition, which is better, ignition or cobalt flux?

1400
01:56:25,700 --> 01:56:27,700
I couldn't tell you because I haven't really played enough cobalt flux.

1401
01:56:27,700 --> 01:56:31,700
I saw it a little bit at E3, but it wasn't familiar enough with it.

1402
01:56:31,700 --> 01:56:33,700
They're both the same fucking pad.

1403
01:56:33,700 --> 01:56:35,700
It's the same damn thing with a different logo on it.

1404
01:56:35,700 --> 01:56:36,700
That's all it is.

1405
01:56:36,700 --> 01:56:37,700
You can't get much different.

1406
01:56:37,700 --> 01:56:40,700
Oh, our metal is different than your metal.

1407
01:56:40,700 --> 01:56:44,700
What about the quality and how many times could it be stepped?

1408
01:56:44,700 --> 01:56:47,700
It doesn't matter, they're the fucking same.

1409
01:56:47,700 --> 01:56:51,700
The scum of flesh says not even a rhino could beat down the pad.

1410
01:56:51,700 --> 01:56:53,700
Oh yeah! Do they have a rhino to test this?

1411
01:56:53,700 --> 01:56:57,700
Do they take it to Africa and go, hey rhino! Step on the pad!

1412
01:56:57,700 --> 01:56:59,700
How do you like it? I mean, I'm sorry.

1413
01:56:59,700 --> 01:57:03,700
Now I can say, yeah guess what? Jupiter has nothing on this pad!

1414
01:57:03,700 --> 01:57:06,700
This pad can fuck up Jupiter!

1415
01:57:06,700 --> 01:57:09,700
Seriously, they're just pulling the shit out of their ass, okay?

1416
01:57:09,700 --> 01:57:11,700
A rhino can't fuck this up!

1417
01:57:11,700 --> 01:57:17,820
oh well I guess what Bigfoot recommends you know red octane so fuck that it's

1418
01:57:17,820 --> 01:57:22,320
stupid really to be honest when it comes down the pads don't buy off the internet

1419
01:57:22,320 --> 01:57:26,000
buy stuff that you can see a store buy it like fries and stuff where you can

1420
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,800
actually see these pads because the shit you get off the internet and because I

1421
01:57:28,800 --> 01:57:34,480
have bought metal pads you know off the internet and I stepped on them and they

1422
01:57:34,480 --> 01:57:41,400
bent they bent downwards and I was like what the fuck it was retarded pads are

1423
01:57:41,400 --> 01:57:44,280
They're not meant to be folded in half.

1424
01:57:44,280 --> 01:57:49,400
Well, talk about how they say SUVs can't bust them on their advertisements.

1425
01:57:49,400 --> 01:57:53,540
Our chat room over at www.orangelaunchrader.com clicking on chat, interesting point, there

1426
01:57:53,540 --> 01:57:59,040
already is a DDR shit mix, and it's the don't fall off mix, the DDR Extreme bootleg.

1427
01:57:59,040 --> 01:58:00,520
You know the one that would speed up?

1428
01:58:00,520 --> 01:58:01,520
Well, actually there's two of them.

1429
01:58:01,520 --> 01:58:02,520
Yeah, I know about the speed up.

1430
01:58:02,520 --> 01:58:03,520
I know about the bootleg.

1431
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:04,520
The one that will speed up.

1432
01:58:04,520 --> 01:58:05,520
DDR Extreme Plus, thank you.

1433
01:58:05,520 --> 01:58:08,520
There's the DDR Extreme, yeah, the one in Country Club Lane, speed up, ooh, let's speed

1434
01:58:08,520 --> 01:58:16,520
Max 300 and let's see if we can beat it at 360ppm, oh wow, or hear Cartoon Heroes in

1435
01:58:16,520 --> 01:58:17,520
a very high touch voice.

1436
01:58:17,520 --> 01:58:21,520
You know what, this is the other thing, I want to change the topic, I want to change

1437
01:58:21,520 --> 01:58:26,920
the topic, because this is another topic I always see on Freak, and it comes up in many

1438
01:58:26,920 --> 01:58:29,600
different kinds of discussions, and it doesn't just come up on Freak, honestly, I've seen

1439
01:58:29,600 --> 01:58:34,640
it even in our chatroom, I've seen it on other sites, what is the deal with Cartoon Heroes?

1440
01:58:34,640 --> 01:58:40,580
Why do so many people freaking love that song and are quick to label a mix as utter shit

1441
01:58:40,580 --> 01:58:42,020
if that song isn't in it?

1442
01:58:42,020 --> 01:58:43,860
I don't understand what is so great about the song.

1443
01:58:43,860 --> 01:58:44,860
Is it a good song?

1444
01:58:44,860 --> 01:58:45,860
Yeah, it's a great song.

1445
01:58:45,860 --> 01:58:47,220
It was a little better when Aqua did it.

1446
01:58:47,220 --> 01:58:48,540
But it's a good song.

1447
01:58:48,540 --> 01:58:49,540
Is it fun to play?

1448
01:58:49,540 --> 01:58:50,540
Kinda.

1449
01:58:50,540 --> 01:58:52,700
I mean, I'll die when I play it.

1450
01:58:52,700 --> 01:58:56,340
But why do so many people freaking obsess over Cartoon Heroes?

1451
01:58:56,340 --> 01:59:02,300
Like, do you know how many people threw a fit when that song was in Extreme USA?

1452
01:59:02,300 --> 01:59:10,300
Let's look back in GDR history and view what we call the songs that ruin mixes.

1453
01:59:10,300 --> 01:59:17,580
Starting with, third mix, Afronova, who could love this wonderful African chant as you jump

1454
01:59:17,580 --> 01:59:19,580
around like a complete nut.

1455
01:59:19,580 --> 01:59:25,820
Fourth mix, Kick the Can, with its repetitive steps over and over and over again.

1456
01:59:25,820 --> 01:59:30,940
There's another contributing factor 1 2 3 4 0 0 7

1457
01:59:32,860 --> 01:59:40,540
You're forgetting though my edit to kick the can aka big cans was awesome and made that song redeemable

1458
01:59:41,980 --> 01:59:48,340
Okay, as I would continue on to fifth mix hot limits the song is just you don't understand what they're saying

1459
01:59:48,340 --> 01:59:50,340
But you know, it's very long

1460
01:59:50,340 --> 02:00:05,340
Anyways, um, DDR Max. I'd say probably that would be, um, Exotic Ethnic was pretty repetitive in DDR Max. Oh no, Flash in the Night. Yeah, that was another one. Flash in the Night.

1461
02:00:05,340 --> 02:00:11,340
Hold on, your mic is still cutting out a little bit. Hold it at the bottom.

1462
02:00:11,340 --> 02:00:18,340
A little bit. Hold it at the bottom. Yeah, try it, try it. Put it close to your mouth. There you go.

1463
02:00:18,340 --> 02:00:24,340
That's the same reason why Cartoon Heroes got ported. That's the same reason why it's so deep it's getting ported off with DDR Max.

1464
02:00:24,340 --> 02:00:27,340
Because it's like hard as hell 9.

1465
02:00:27,340 --> 02:00:33,340
I would say the song that ruined DDR Max, even though I love this song, Cowgirl.

1466
02:00:33,340 --> 02:00:40,880
Cowgirl, yes. Um, Max 2, Sagaru, and who could not forget the song that added everyone dancin'...

1467
02:00:41,880 --> 02:00:44,200
Blow My Whistle, Bitch.

1468
02:00:44,200 --> 02:00:45,560
Oh, God.

1469
02:00:45,560 --> 02:00:51,680
Blow My Whistle, Bitch definitely ruined Max 2. Okay, so, make your point, please.

1470
02:00:52,220 --> 02:00:55,500
My point is... I don't have a point. The point is that...

1471
02:00:55,900 --> 02:00:58,540
that there's always gonna be a song that people...

1472
02:00:58,540 --> 02:01:05,180
they're catchy and annoying catchy and to be honest i hate cartoon heroes and i know there's

1473
02:01:05,180 --> 02:01:09,260
50 bands out there that all sound like them in fact i hear different artists i'm like is that

1474
02:01:09,260 --> 02:01:16,380
you know aqua no it's not aqua it's um toy box or it's you know insert band here you know captain

1475
02:01:16,380 --> 02:01:21,100
jack i mean it's they sound all the fucking same they have like the same singer that sings super

1476
02:01:21,100 --> 02:01:24,540
high-pitched

1477
02:01:24,540 --> 02:01:27,980
i think that it's a man who's been you know

1478
02:01:27,980 --> 02:01:32,460
i think she's on smack that's what's going on she's on helium

1479
02:01:32,460 --> 02:01:34,660
she's fucking taking speed she's on crack

1480
02:01:34,660 --> 02:01:37,580
crystal meth

1481
02:01:37,580 --> 02:01:39,780
it's awful okay

1482
02:01:39,780 --> 02:01:44,780
there's always going to be that annoying song

1483
02:01:44,780 --> 02:01:58,500
It's annoying when it was originally- Have you seen the video for this? The video for

1484
02:01:58,500 --> 02:02:04,820
this is fucking annoying, okay? Honestly, it's just like, you're confusing the original-

1485
02:02:04,820 --> 02:02:09,620
There was no video to that. You're confusing the original Aqua song, which is a little-

1486
02:02:09,620 --> 02:02:14,320
It's a little bit slower, even though it sounds very similar. It's a little bit slower. Pretty

1487
02:02:14,320 --> 02:02:21,240
Pretty much. Okay, take the original Cartoon Heroes by Aqua and play it on DDR Extreme

1488
02:02:21,240 --> 02:02:25,120
Plus with the plus twenty percent modifier and that's what you get.

1489
02:02:25,120 --> 02:02:26,120
Ah!

1490
02:02:26,120 --> 02:02:27,120
It's awful.

1491
02:02:27,120 --> 02:02:28,120
It's awful.

1492
02:02:28,120 --> 02:02:29,120
It's awful.

1493
02:02:29,120 --> 02:02:32,200
Anyways, yeah, they should have Extreme Plus Plus, which like, you know, speeds it up by

1494
02:02:32,200 --> 02:02:33,320
a hundred percent or something like that.

1495
02:02:33,320 --> 02:02:34,320
It's just unbelievable.

1496
02:02:34,320 --> 02:02:35,800
A hundred percent? Okay, max six hundred.

1497
02:02:35,800 --> 02:02:36,800
Anyways.

1498
02:02:36,800 --> 02:02:41,720
One, two, three, four, max three hundred.

1499
02:02:41,720 --> 02:02:48,720
Then we have songs that ruin the remix scene, but we'll do that another day.

1500
02:02:49,800 --> 02:02:54,720
Speaking of songs that ruin DDR, I wanted to have an old-school flashback and start

1501
02:02:54,720 --> 02:02:59,120
it off with an old favorite song of mine. Love this song. Jamie was dying to hear some

1502
02:02:59,120 --> 02:03:02,800
Second Mix songs that are actually good songs, so we're going to put those in. So we're going

1503
02:03:02,800 --> 02:03:05,600
to play those songs. But we have to start it off with a song I've been threatening all

1504
02:03:05,600 --> 02:03:11,400
night long. It is the most old-school of old-school DDR songs. Please take a minute, despite how

1505
02:03:11,400 --> 02:03:18,200
you feel about this song, this one goes out to the one and only, God bless his soul, he's

1506
02:03:18,200 --> 02:03:24,040
not listening to us right now because he's out there, Kyle Snyder. God bless Kyle Snyder,

1507
02:03:24,040 --> 02:03:31,160
seriously. But honestly, this, despite how you feel about this song, respect for a moment

1508
02:03:31,160 --> 02:03:34,160
Please, we'll be back here on Orange Last Radio.

1509
02:04:01,160 --> 02:04:08,160
I'll be searching in the woods, and trying from the fields, just to find a sweet summer

1510
02:04:08,160 --> 02:04:09,160
sunrise.

1511
02:04:09,160 --> 02:04:26,160
I'll be searching in the woods, and trying from the fields, just to find a sweet summer

1512
02:04:26,160 --> 02:04:31,160
I'm on the hill just to find my sweet summer summer ride

1513
02:04:31,160 --> 02:04:34,160
One, one secret to keep me in this mess

1514
02:04:34,160 --> 02:04:38,160
Yes, I need fun in my summer ride

1515
02:04:38,160 --> 02:04:41,160
Aye, aye, aye, on your lips after five

1516
02:04:41,160 --> 02:04:45,160
We make a move, make a color to the sky

1517
02:04:45,160 --> 02:04:48,160
Aye, aye, aye, on your lips after five

1518
02:04:48,160 --> 02:04:52,160
We make a move, make a color to the sky

1519
02:06:52,160 --> 02:06:54,160
Boom, boom, money finin', dawg

You're very hard, you look like a young fella

1528
02:07:26,160 --> 02:07:29,160
Take me overnight

1529
02:07:29,160 --> 02:07:31,160
Boom, boom, boom, boom

1530
02:07:31,160 --> 02:07:33,160
Something like a boom, boom

02:07:33,160 --> 02:07:35,160
Boom, boom, boom, boom

More

1536
02:07:42,160 --> 02:07:44,160

Don't give them my way, yeah, yeah

Leave them out on the streets at night

1542
02:08:31,160 --> 02:08:34,160
I've been picking up those kind of strangers

1543
02:08:34,160 --> 02:08:36,160
You can fly, you can fly

1544
02:08:36,160 --> 02:08:40,160
When you can't go, you can fly, you can fly

1545
02:08:40,160 --> 02:08:44,160
But you want it inside

1546
02:08:44,160 --> 02:09:07,160
You ask yourself, who they are Like everybody else, they wanna be alone

1547
02:09:07,160 --> 02:09:11,160
There comes, there comes, you've got your dirty back down

1548
02:09:15,160 --> 02:09:19,160
There comes, there comes, you've got your dirty back down

1549
02:09:19,160 --> 02:09:44,280
We are back, hi, on Orange Lounge Radio.

1550
02:09:44,280 --> 02:09:48,040
We are such nerds, I was sitting there chatting on my DS with everyone else during the break.

1551
02:09:48,040 --> 02:09:50,040
We have four DS's in this-

1552
02:09:50,040 --> 02:09:54,040
I didn't think we had five, but I'm not breaking mine out.

1553
02:09:54,040 --> 02:09:59,040
I know. Yeah, that's right. You got your DS here too, Jamie. We could just have a DS chat.

1554
02:09:59,040 --> 02:10:01,040
I was trying to put some pictures there on the webcam.

1555
02:10:01,040 --> 02:10:05,040
I wrote penis, really dark, so you guys could see it, and then put it in the chat room.

1556
02:10:05,040 --> 02:10:07,040
Who's calling me during the show?

1557
02:10:07,040 --> 02:10:09,040
These people should know better.

1558
02:10:09,040 --> 02:10:11,040
Especially this person.

1559
02:10:11,040 --> 02:10:13,040
Shame.

1560
02:10:13,040 --> 02:10:15,040
Alright.

1561
02:10:15,040 --> 02:10:16,040
I'm just waiting-

1562
02:10:16,040 --> 02:10:17,040
What about- Yes.

1563
02:10:17,040 --> 02:10:25,040
I'm just waiting for the emulator to work with bluetooth and then we'll get a wireless router so we can upload them all to a streaming chat room.

1564
02:10:25,040 --> 02:10:27,040
That's the dream.

1565
02:10:30,040 --> 02:10:37,040
Oh god, for the person who requested butterfly pikachu mix in the chat, no!

1566
02:10:37,040 --> 02:10:40,040
I do have that, I do have that. No, I'm not going to fire them.

1567
02:10:42,040 --> 02:10:45,040
Who wants to hear who won the cage match tonight?

1568
02:10:45,040 --> 02:10:59,040
The winning song of tonight's cage match actually surprised me a little bit. It only won by two votes. Not one vote, but two votes. It all came down to two votes. The winning song of tonight's cage match.

1569
02:11:05,040 --> 02:11:10,040
Believe it or not, it won. I'm actually surprised. I thought Monolithic had it sealed.

1570
02:11:10,040 --> 02:11:13,340
Because she said it was going to be retired, and they want another retired one.

1571
02:11:13,340 --> 02:11:22,340
That's basically it. So, Gwen Stefani is officially retired. It'll spend one more week in the spotlight, and then three brand new songs for you to listen to next week.

1572
02:11:22,340 --> 02:11:24,340
As is her career.

1573
02:11:25,340 --> 02:11:26,340
What?

1574
02:11:26,340 --> 02:11:28,340
As is her career.

1575
02:11:28,340 --> 02:11:38,900
I was going to take another call over Skype, but I know that our chatters are kind of shy

1576
02:11:38,900 --> 02:11:43,020
and probably wouldn't want to call in, so how about we get into the FUs of the week?

1577
02:11:43,020 --> 02:11:47,380
I think now is a good time, especially after that victory, to get into the FUs of the week.

1578
02:11:47,380 --> 02:11:49,340
Does that sound like a plan for you, Jamie?

1579
02:11:49,340 --> 02:11:50,340
Eh.

1580
02:11:50,340 --> 02:11:55,460
Alright, and why is it, Miss Jamie, that we have to do the FUs of the week every single

1581
02:11:55,460 --> 02:11:56,860
week on this show?

1582
02:11:56,860 --> 02:12:03,860
because everything sucks

1583
02:12:15,700 --> 02:12:23,340
big f u goes toward the stinky person on the plane who cut a big fart sitting in front of me

1584
02:12:23,340 --> 02:12:30,420
F.U. goes toward just general backwards ass shit, having no free time, and my weird grammatical

1585
02:12:30,420 --> 02:12:34,380
errors, and the four bottles of Guinness I had last night, and that's really about it.

1586
02:12:34,380 --> 02:12:35,380
That's it?

1587
02:12:35,380 --> 02:12:36,380
Yeah.

1588
02:12:36,380 --> 02:12:48,500
I don't want a big F.U. to my mom for saying that her chronic bronchitis is not aggravated

1589
02:12:48,500 --> 02:12:49,500
by cigarette smoke.

1590
02:12:49,500 --> 02:12:50,500
No.

1591
02:12:50,500 --> 02:12:55,500
Alright, you sure you're done? Are you sure?

1592
02:12:55,500 --> 02:12:56,500
Yep.

1593
02:12:56,500 --> 02:12:57,500
You sure?

1594
02:12:57,500 --> 02:12:58,500
Yes.

1595
02:12:58,500 --> 02:12:59,500
Alright. Alright, here we go. Loki, your turn.

1596
02:12:59,500 --> 02:13:05,100
Fuck you, Folsom, on multiple occasions.

1597
02:13:05,100 --> 02:13:11,340
Number one being, um, the lights, literally, the lights, the stop lights around here are

1598
02:13:11,340 --> 02:13:16,180
so short. I came to a stop light. I saw it turn from

1599
02:13:16,180 --> 02:13:17,240
green

1600
02:13:17,240 --> 02:13:21,220
to read field uh...

1601
02:13:21,220 --> 02:13:23,440
you know all the colors and everything

1602
02:13:23,440 --> 02:13:25,300
with less than a second

1603
02:13:25,300 --> 02:13:26,540
public what the fuck

1604
02:13:26,540 --> 02:13:30,400
there's not even enough time for one car to go through life

1605
02:13:30,400 --> 02:13:34,140
is ridiculous

1606
02:13:34,140 --> 02:13:35,180
then uh...

1607
02:13:35,180 --> 02:13:38,100
but you too uh... a giant marathon is out there

1608
02:13:38,100 --> 02:13:39,300
fucking hell

1609
02:13:39,300 --> 02:13:41,940
i've got a lot of eyes that we don't live around here

1610
02:13:41,940 --> 02:13:43,660
the matter

1611
02:13:43,660 --> 02:13:46,660
you didn't have to hear it five in the fucking morning

1612
02:13:46,660 --> 02:13:50,020
PORC program

1613
02:13:50,020 --> 02:13:53,060
County over giant loud speaker out

1614
02:13:53,060 --> 02:13:56,320
right if but enough that they think to go for my parking vop

1615
02:13:56,320 --> 02:14:00,240
up close to our apartment with gotten into the body or party

1616
02:14:00,240 --> 02:14:04,540
okay four portn' potty meeting with 50 or two body

1617
02:14:04,540 --> 02:14:07,740
along the street right date for more disease

1618
02:14:07,740 --> 02:14:10,780
replays in the parking fees is along with

1619
02:14:10,780 --> 02:14:15,760
some stupid booth, okay? Now, I'm no genius here, but since the fucking, you know, damn

1620
02:14:15,760 --> 02:14:19,640
road is closed, eh, I'd say that's a pretty good chance that you could probably put that

1621
02:14:19,640 --> 02:14:26,640
booth right there next to all the goddamn fucking porta-potties. Wow! Wouldn't that

1622
02:14:26,640 --> 02:14:33,520
make sense? But no. So we have to make noise for three hours. Three hours in the morning.

1623
02:14:33,520 --> 02:14:39,440
See, I was expecting not to hear the marathon because last time I slept through it, but,

1624
02:14:39,440 --> 02:14:44,440
You know, I got woken up, and my first thing that came to my mind was, this is fucking

1625
02:14:44,440 --> 02:14:45,940
ridiculous.

1626
02:14:45,940 --> 02:14:49,960
And we went outside, and there's tons of runners, and trust me, if I'm outside-

1627
02:14:49,960 --> 02:14:53,560
KCR A3 is protecting you with our live pinpoint Doppler radar.

1628
02:14:53,560 --> 02:14:58,040
I don't fucking care about your pinpoint Doppler radar!

1629
02:14:58,040 --> 02:15:01,760
I was trying to find a link to the chatroom.

1630
02:15:01,760 --> 02:15:03,740
I was trying to find a link about the marathon.

1631
02:15:03,740 --> 02:15:09,240
There was a story on a local news station I was going to send it to, that's actually

1632
02:15:09,240 --> 02:15:20,120
kinda funny now that I think about it. F U channel 3. So anyway, yeah, that really sucks.

1633
02:15:20,120 --> 02:15:30,840
Other than that, a premature, oh man, premature fuck you to my car that has to go in on Thursday,

1634
02:15:30,840 --> 02:15:37,800
and it's gonna suck because I'm gonna, I know they're gonna try to screw me out of my fucking

1635
02:15:37,800 --> 02:15:42,800
vinuvinumusic

1636
02:16:07,800 --> 02:16:11,560
unintelligent people my entire life people that misspell something and then

1637
02:16:11,560 --> 02:16:18,600
miss they're like for instance please help me out spell PL PL no PL I first

1638
02:16:18,600 --> 02:16:24,480
and they're all I'm sorry and misspelled that PL is please please please help me

1639
02:16:24,480 --> 02:16:31,280
out I'm going to Ragnarok chat my god I would say please learn how to spell

1640
02:16:31,280 --> 02:16:35,720
anyways I just hate people and they're bad grammar I mean honestly I can

1641
02:16:35,720 --> 02:16:56,720
I understand shorthand, you know, using R and U as actual words, even though they're not, um, but, you know, just, if you're going to at least spell correctly or do the abbreviations correctly, because I can't understand you when you're typing and all this weird shit, adding spaces where they do not belong, I don't know. I'm done.

1642
02:16:56,720 --> 02:17:08,960
After you to that marathon that was going on outside the house this morning, seriously,

1643
02:17:08,960 --> 02:17:12,460
you can go to like any Sacramento based website and read about this marathon, it's a huge

1644
02:17:12,460 --> 02:17:14,000
event that happens every year.

1645
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:18,680
I think that's great if you want to do a marathon and what have you, but freaking shut up or

1646
02:17:18,680 --> 02:17:23,920
start the thing after, you know, after, there's a noise ordinance in the city that says do

1647
02:17:23,920 --> 02:17:26,600
do not make noise until after eight a.m.

1648
02:17:26,600 --> 02:17:29,540
So, frickin' turn your loudspeakers off until eight a.m.

1649
02:17:29,540 --> 02:17:31,320
Or, you know what, it doesn't make sense to me.

1650
02:17:31,320 --> 02:17:35,480
We live right behind a huge lake that is emptiness.

1651
02:17:35,480 --> 02:17:37,460
There's nothing at the lake.

1652
02:17:37,460 --> 02:17:39,720
Nobody goes to the lake in the wintertime.

1653
02:17:39,720 --> 02:17:44,240
Start the marathon just like 300 feet away at the lake, okay?

1654
02:17:44,240 --> 02:17:46,700
Honestly, it's a marathon.

1655
02:17:46,700 --> 02:17:48,800
They can run a little further.

1656
02:17:48,800 --> 02:17:52,800
But Rob, it's 9-11 and, you know, Paris.

1657
02:17:52,800 --> 02:18:01,800
But here's the thing I don't understand, okay? I can understand, okay, I would have not had a problem if the guy is just like, you know, okay, we're gonna be starting the race at da da da da time, you know, this kind of thing?

1658
02:18:01,800 --> 02:18:08,800
And then at the time, you know, five, four, three, two, one, go! You know, like he did. But no, he had the, and ah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah!

1659
02:18:08,800 --> 02:18:17,800
He just talked for three hours straight! It's like, you know, I understand you have, you know, the P.A. and stuff to, you know, get a hold of, you know, the attention of these people.

1660
02:18:17,800 --> 02:18:22,680
these people. But you don't need to fucking talk, like, all the time! Just say, okay,

1661
02:18:22,680 --> 02:18:26,880
well, you know, announce, you know, 15 minutes before the race starts, you know, so you can

1662
02:18:26,880 --> 02:18:31,560
get in your marks, you know, and then do the countdown, and that's it! Oh, and then there's

1663
02:18:31,560 --> 02:18:38,040
a fucking siren after that! Wooooo! Like, cause you didn't, you didn't see, oh, why

1664
02:18:38,040 --> 02:18:43,160
are all those people running? One more thing I forgot to add, sorry I'm stealing your thing,

1665
02:18:43,160 --> 02:18:44,920
what do you believe the party here

1666
02:18:44,920 --> 02:18:46,580
because the report

1667
02:18:46,580 --> 02:18:50,680
now i get that the ok i'd get the f you to the police department because frickin

1668
02:18:50,680 --> 02:18:53,240
i called them at six thirty in the morning thing

1669
02:18:53,240 --> 02:18:57,080
there is a marathon going on side of the outside this house i'm sure you're aware

1670
02:18:57,080 --> 02:19:00,040
but they are being way too loud and that he's what she's like

1671
02:19:00,040 --> 02:19:02,380
sorry sir there's nothing i can do about that

1672
02:19:02,380 --> 02:19:05,300
i said are you aware that there's no there's a city ordinance that they can

1673
02:19:05,300 --> 02:19:06,840
ignore it before eight a m

1674
02:19:06,840 --> 02:19:09,960
if you have an issue that you have to call city hall and request a permit

1675
02:19:09,960 --> 02:19:14,040
Now I'm gonna have to look like a big, Grinchy asshole when the fact of the matter is I'm

1676
02:19:14,040 --> 02:19:17,480
probably not even gonna live here next year, but I am not gonna let this shit slide!

1677
02:19:17,480 --> 02:19:22,480
I am pissed that they woke me up at 6.30 on a freaking Sunday when I was out drinking

1678
02:19:22,480 --> 02:19:23,480
the night before!

1679
02:19:23,480 --> 02:19:24,480
ASS!

1680
02:19:24,480 --> 02:19:28,080
Sorry, Loki, you had a thought.

1681
02:19:28,080 --> 02:19:31,480
My thought was because this police officer parked his car in the middle of the fucking

1682
02:19:31,480 --> 02:19:37,640
lane on the street, no reason, just sitting there with his flashers on, not blocking traffic

1683
02:19:37,640 --> 02:19:41,320
because there's an accident or he pulled someone over or he was

1684
02:19:41,320 --> 02:19:44,120
filling around with god knows what you've worked in the middle of fucking

1685
02:19:44,120 --> 02:19:45,200
road

1686
02:19:45,200 --> 02:19:47,320
for no reason

1687
02:19:47,320 --> 02:19:49,340
so i went around it

1688
02:19:49,340 --> 02:19:50,800
on the inside

1689
02:19:50,800 --> 02:19:52,280
at

1690
02:19:52,280 --> 02:19:56,020
so there was a dead person there i would have run over

1691
02:19:56,020 --> 02:19:59,100
to be continued i'm going to call and complain on monday just you wait and i

1692
02:19:59,100 --> 02:20:01,720

1693
02:20:01,720 --> 02:20:06,040
i'm taking lessons from jamie i'm gonna have approved read my angry letter

1694
02:20:06,040 --> 02:20:08,440
I'll do it too. I'll make up stuff to put in it.

1695
02:20:08,440 --> 02:20:10,920
Awesome, and you should sign it, even though you don't live here.

1696
02:20:10,920 --> 02:20:12,360
Alright.

1697
02:20:12,360 --> 02:20:16,040
Let's go around and get some other folks in the studio to get their FUs of the week.

1698
02:20:16,040 --> 02:20:18,600
We'll start off with Angel.

1699
02:20:18,600 --> 02:20:21,400
Um...

1700
02:20:21,400 --> 02:20:25,920
Just FU to...

1701
02:20:25,920 --> 02:20:28,080
Yeah, I don't know. Shit.

1702
02:20:28,080 --> 02:20:30,040
I actually don't really have one.

1703
02:20:30,040 --> 02:20:33,040
FU to my instructor because he's mad.

1704
02:20:33,040 --> 02:20:37,560
he's actually letting us out on the 8th or something like that

1705
02:20:37,560 --> 02:20:44,560
but uh... we still gotta come back to the finals, so I don't know what's up with that. I don't know, whatever.

1706
02:20:44,840 --> 02:20:50,640
Arcadian42, you're up use of the week.

1707
02:20:50,640 --> 02:20:51,840
Alright, make sure...

1708
02:20:51,840 --> 02:20:54,560
Can you hear me? Can you? I can hear you.

1709
02:20:54,560 --> 02:20:56,960
Okay, uh...

1710
02:20:56,960 --> 02:21:06,960
I don't know about the winter, it just makes my skin start getting all dry and I just drink lots of water, but it still doesn't help.

1711
02:21:06,960 --> 02:21:18,960
Anyway, yeah, and Loki was talking about stupid traffic lights. There's one near my work that's stupid that's misprogrammed.

1712
02:21:18,960 --> 02:21:23,680
like changes in five seconds after like five seconds from green to yellow

1713
02:21:23,680 --> 02:21:28,080
and some like recently they fucked up the timing so that

1714
02:21:28,080 --> 02:21:31,120
this crossroad isn't getting all that much traffic it's like

1715
02:21:31,120 --> 02:21:34,920
you have to sit there for a minute before it goes back to green

1716
02:21:34,920 --> 02:21:38,920
so that's annoying

1717
02:21:38,920 --> 02:21:41,200
get a laziness

1718
02:21:41,200 --> 02:21:43,640
but still hurting evening from

1719
02:21:43,640 --> 02:21:45,640
plain DDO or something

1720
02:21:45,640 --> 02:21:47,640
Lazy, yeah, whatever.

1721
02:22:15,640 --> 02:22:21,720
walking in the fucking freeway just because the fucking marathon was going on. Oh, you're

1722
02:22:21,720 --> 02:22:30,720
just going to cause more trouble to the fucking freeway. Thanks a lot. Okay. And F.E. to the

1723
02:22:30,720 --> 02:22:37,400
forums nowadays saying about girls playing DDR or gays playing DDR. Who gives a shit?

1724
02:22:37,400 --> 02:22:44,200
People play DDR. That is all. I have something to say about that, but I'll wait until later.

1725
02:22:44,200 --> 02:22:47,800
Nobody knows that girls and gays have no place in DDR.

1726
02:22:47,800 --> 02:22:49,440
I was not going to say that by just saying.

1727
02:22:49,440 --> 02:22:53,920
You know, two-thirds of the show is comprised of girls and gays, so I would watch your little

1728
02:22:53,920 --> 02:22:54,920
mouth there.

1729
02:22:54,920 --> 02:22:58,120
I mean, I'm just saying, it's just DDR.

1730
02:22:58,120 --> 02:23:00,640
There's nothing special about it.

1731
02:23:00,640 --> 02:23:07,160
Some people take it way too seriously in the forums.

1732
02:23:07,160 --> 02:23:10,320
All right, is that it?

1733
02:23:10,320 --> 02:23:15,320
FU2 Finals coming up soon.

1734
02:23:15,320 --> 02:23:22,320
FU2 for not being able to spend money for Christmas because I have to spend some money on bills and stuff.

1735
02:23:22,320 --> 02:23:24,320
And that's about it for now.

1736
02:23:24,320 --> 02:23:26,320
Alright, let's get to the chatroom FUs.

1737
02:23:26,320 --> 02:23:28,320
They're mad at me because I told them they had to keep it short tonight.

1738
02:23:28,320 --> 02:23:29,320
They don't like that.

1739
02:23:29,320 --> 02:23:31,320
But seriously, we've got like 20 people that send FUs in tonight.

1740
02:23:31,320 --> 02:23:32,320
It's a lot.

1741
02:23:32,320 --> 02:23:33,320
We need to go ahead and read one, though.

1742
02:23:33,320 --> 02:23:34,320
Yes, Jamie has one.

1743
02:23:34,320 --> 02:23:35,320
She wants to read first.

1744
02:23:35,320 --> 02:23:41,320
Because I'm actually on AAM right now and I'm not telling anybody what name I'm on.

1745
02:23:41,320 --> 02:23:45,320
It's a FU from Vogue Web Security.

1746
02:23:45,320 --> 02:23:50,320
A big FU to our roommate M for eating all of our food and not buying anything.

1747
02:23:50,320 --> 02:23:56,440
shipping ramps good sushi make all right dark knight would like to give a

1748
02:23:56,440 --> 02:24:00,220
gigantic fu to me getting sick and working at the same time somebody shoot

1749
02:24:00,220 --> 02:24:03,600
me please and one more f you for my dumbness when I took my placement test

1750
02:24:03,600 --> 02:24:06,680
during the week talk about brain farts man

1751
02:24:06,680 --> 02:24:11,920
seagurd says first f you goes to the show for not talking about drawn

1752
02:24:11,920 --> 02:24:16,920
together nearly enough for you f you to illusion for turning down offers of sex

1753
02:24:16,920 --> 02:24:21,220
for his vote, and FU to Hot Topic for not having any drawn together shirts, even though

1754
02:24:21,220 --> 02:24:25,740
they don't exist yet. You know, think about it this way. If Illusion had changed his vote

1755
02:24:25,740 --> 02:24:29,780
from Gwen to Monolithic, then it would have been a tie, and Jamie probably would have

1756
02:24:29,780 --> 02:24:33,780
went with Monolithic when she broke the tie. So, just think about that one.

1757
02:24:33,780 --> 02:24:41,820
No, wait, no. Oh, okay, well, hey. Flaronay says, FU to Nintendo for not allowing Game

1758
02:24:41,820 --> 02:24:45,060
Game Boy and Game Boy Color games to be played on the DS.

1759
02:24:45,060 --> 02:24:46,680
What the fuck?

1760
02:24:46,680 --> 02:24:50,360
This just goes along with Nintendo's method of getting you to buy the same thing 50 million

1761
02:24:50,360 --> 02:24:51,360
times.

1762
02:24:51,360 --> 02:24:56,520
MPQ says, F you to Microsoft for not letting me install Japanese IME.

1763
02:24:56,520 --> 02:24:58,120
I'm having that same problem too.

1764
02:24:58,120 --> 02:25:00,440
F you to Suncoast for ripping me off and charging me...

1765
02:25:00,440 --> 02:25:01,440
What?

1766
02:25:01,440 --> 02:25:02,440
What?

1767
02:25:02,440 --> 02:25:03,440
Explicit what?

1768
02:25:03,440 --> 02:25:08,440
You have to download a different patch, not the global IME from Microsoft.

1769
02:25:08,440 --> 02:25:10,440
Oh, maybe that's what's going on.

1770
02:25:10,440 --> 02:25:11,440
All right.

1771
02:25:11,440 --> 02:25:12,940
Who am I gonna meet for that?

1772
02:25:12,940 --> 02:25:17,740
Uh, FU to Suncoast for ripping me off and charging me $30 a disc for Azumanga Daioh.

1773
02:25:17,740 --> 02:25:18,740
I hope I said that right.

1774
02:25:18,740 --> 02:25:19,940
FU to the Ta-

1775
02:25:19,940 --> 02:25:21,240
What? What was that?

1776
02:25:21,240 --> 02:25:22,740
You said it right, Azumanga Daioh.

1777
02:25:22,740 --> 02:25:25,240
Hey, I pronounced something right. What do you know?

1778
02:25:25,240 --> 02:25:29,240
FU to the Taiko Drumsticks for being uncomfortable and hurting my hands.

1779
02:25:29,240 --> 02:25:32,240
FU to people who call it Singles and Doubles on DDR.

1780
02:25:32,240 --> 02:25:34,240
It's not tennis.

1781
02:25:34,240 --> 02:25:36,740
Lastly, fuck everyone who has access to 2DX.

1782
02:25:36,740 --> 02:25:38,240
It's Singles and Doubles.

1783
02:25:38,240 --> 02:25:39,740
The fuck you talking about? It is Singles and Doubles.

1784
02:25:39,740 --> 02:25:42,380
It's been singles and doubles since the first one.

1785
02:25:42,380 --> 02:25:43,740
I think...

1786
02:25:43,740 --> 02:25:45,060
What about Crack Planet?

1787
02:25:45,060 --> 02:25:48,620
I think it might be the way in which you say it.

1788
02:25:48,620 --> 02:25:50,940
I think I might get what it is.

1789
02:25:50,940 --> 02:25:54,340
I think I get the tennis comparison.

1790
02:25:54,340 --> 02:25:58,020
Did I get the fuck everyone who has access to 2DX? I don't know.

1791
02:25:58,020 --> 02:25:59,740
Those are from MPQ.

1792
02:25:59,740 --> 02:26:05,740
Poto says, F you to World of Warcraft eating up every second of my life.

1793
02:26:05,740 --> 02:26:10,260
Jaded2004 says, F you to everyone who hates smile decay.

1794
02:26:10,260 --> 02:26:13,660
Rychan says, F you to myself for being emotionally stupid last night.

1795
02:26:13,660 --> 02:26:16,620
F you to egos killing the gaming star.

1796
02:26:16,620 --> 02:26:17,980
Hey, didn't I say that one?

1797
02:26:17,980 --> 02:26:20,740
F you to tomorrow not being Thursday.

1798
02:26:20,740 --> 02:26:22,900
Big hug, Rychan, big hug.

1799
02:26:22,900 --> 02:26:28,020
Blarg says, F you to egalitarians?

1800
02:26:28,020 --> 02:26:30,060
Egalitarians.

1801
02:26:30,060 --> 02:26:31,780
Egalitarians, I can pronounce words.

1802
02:26:31,780 --> 02:26:33,260
I just have to sound it out in my mind.

1803
02:26:33,260 --> 02:26:36,580
Misty says, first and foremost, F you to the cage match.

1804
02:26:36,580 --> 02:26:39,540
Secondly, F you to chicken tenders and French toast sticks.

1805
02:26:39,540 --> 02:26:41,100
Cause I think I'm just pissed about that

1806
02:26:41,100 --> 02:26:43,900
cause I was working those parts of the kitchen at the time.

1807
02:26:45,540 --> 02:26:47,980
Oops, I hope I didn't close the new window.

1808
02:26:47,980 --> 02:26:50,300
I hope I didn't miss somebody's F you, sorry if I did.

1809
02:26:50,300 --> 02:26:52,720
Snow Cat says, F you to having a birthday in December

1810
02:26:52,720 --> 02:26:53,840
and to people who think it's better

1811
02:26:53,840 --> 02:26:56,580
to combine presents, bastards.

1812
02:26:56,580 --> 02:26:59,060
DJ Ramez says, giant F you to my job

1813
02:26:59,060 --> 02:27:00,140
for cutting my hours again.

1814
02:27:00,140 --> 02:27:02,580
You bastards, I gotta eat too, you know.

1815
02:27:02,580 --> 02:27:06,380
Another F.U. to the retard tech that I work with, you are a fucking tool.

1816
02:27:06,380 --> 02:27:10,660
I swear if you did get a job through affirmative action, I'm putting in my two weeks.

1817
02:27:10,660 --> 02:27:12,300
F.U. short version.

1818
02:27:12,300 --> 02:27:15,300
Oh, well I read the long version.

1819
02:27:15,300 --> 02:27:18,060
Legend of Zaku says, F.U. to not having a girlfriend.

1820
02:27:18,060 --> 02:27:21,460
F.U. to all the drama that I have to put up with in the DDR Freak New York forums,

1821
02:27:21,460 --> 02:27:24,260
thus resulting in the locking of the forums for a short time,

1822
02:27:24,260 --> 02:27:26,220
and the near split that was about to happen.

1823
02:27:26,220 --> 02:27:32,500
And F.U. to the Chinese language for being so fucking hard to speak and write.

1824
02:27:32,500 --> 02:27:35,380
I could say something about the New York forum thing.

1825
02:27:35,380 --> 02:27:37,100
I'll leave a comment.

1826
02:27:37,100 --> 02:27:39,500
OK, I'll comment, because I have no status on freaks,

1827
02:27:39,500 --> 02:27:42,340
so it's fine for me to comment.

1828
02:27:42,340 --> 02:27:45,420
You guys need to learn how to respect authority.

1829
02:27:45,420 --> 02:27:46,860
I'm not saying you in particular,

1830
02:27:46,860 --> 02:27:49,380
but I mean, it seems like when somebody says, don't do this,

1831
02:27:49,380 --> 02:27:50,840
like a million people want to do it.

1832
02:27:50,840 --> 02:27:54,180
And then you wonder why people get angry.

1833
02:27:54,180 --> 02:27:55,300
Anyway.

1834
02:27:55,300 --> 02:27:57,580
Films off the internet.

1835
02:27:57,580 --> 02:27:59,980
Anyway.

1836
02:27:59,980 --> 02:28:02,180
I'm going to get shit for that, but I don't care.

1837
02:28:02,180 --> 02:28:04,580
Dark Tetsuya says, a continued FU to Comcast.

1838
02:28:04,580 --> 02:28:07,220
I recently got to see the nuclear train wreck that

1839
02:28:07,220 --> 02:28:09,320
is the new screen savers.

1840
02:28:09,320 --> 02:28:12,820
I can tell the show's going down the toilet.

1841
02:28:12,820 --> 02:28:16,660
Oh my god, Rob, you said nuclear.

1842
02:28:16,660 --> 02:28:18,340
It's a joke.

1843
02:28:18,340 --> 02:28:21,060
FU to Xbox Live on UltraMix 2 being so glitchy

1844
02:28:21,060 --> 02:28:23,700
that we had to start the tournament over five times

1845
02:28:23,700 --> 02:28:25,820
because it kept quitting and being glitchy.

1846
02:28:25,820 --> 02:28:27,740
FU to the douche bags in my English class

1847
02:28:27,740 --> 02:28:30,140
that don't have the brain capacity to talk about anything

1848
02:28:30,140 --> 02:28:34,340
other than sports for more than five seconds at a time. And FU to Seagurd for cheating

1849
02:28:34,340 --> 02:28:44,340
on me. Man, what a whore. Oh my. VX Jason XV, who says I should just call him Jason but

1850
02:28:44,340 --> 02:28:49,460
I don't, says FU to data entry. It makes us lazy people cry. Funny that I call myself

1851
02:28:49,460 --> 02:28:53,060
lazy, although I'm writing a program to parse data for me automatically instead of taking

1852
02:28:53,060 --> 02:29:01,500
less time to just do it myself. And F you to irony. And that's gonna do it for the F

1853
02:29:01,500 --> 02:29:06,300
yous of the week. Thanks for playing, boys and girls. Yes, Logie. One last one. Fuck

1854
02:29:06,300 --> 02:29:13,860
you to KFC for getting rid of your sweet and sour sauce. Why would KFC get rid of sweet

1855
02:29:13,860 --> 02:29:18,020
and sour sauce? Did PETA make him do that or something? They just got rid of their sweet

1856
02:29:18,020 --> 02:29:22,700
and sour sauce. I got popcorn chicken like last week from there. And I was like, okay,

1857
02:29:22,700 --> 02:29:26,640
I want some sweet and extra sweet and sour sauce on the side. Oh, we don't have sweet and sour sauce. What?

1858
02:29:27,260 --> 02:29:29,260
What is this craziness?

1859
02:29:29,620 --> 02:29:34,460
I don't get it. What the hell? Why would you? That was like the best sauce they had. Now they have ranch.

1860
02:29:35,100 --> 02:29:37,100
Whoo, ranch.

1861
02:29:37,100 --> 02:29:40,060
Ranching mustard. Honey mustard.

1862
02:29:41,180 --> 02:29:46,000
I want my fucking sweet and sour sauce. It's like classic. McDonald's has their sweet and sour sauce. Fuck,

1863
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:47,860
I eat the sweet and sour sauce by itself.

1864
02:29:47,860 --> 02:29:52,860
I mean, I don't understand why you can't just, you know, give me the nice sweet and sour sauce you had.

1865
02:29:52,860 --> 02:29:55,860
I'd buy up the reserves. I would.

1866
02:29:55,860 --> 02:29:57,860
Anyways.

1867
02:29:57,860 --> 02:29:59,860
I think it's time to go to our break, boys and girls.

1868
02:29:59,860 --> 02:30:02,860
When we come back from this break, I think we'll do a little bit of Ask Orange Lounge,

1869
02:30:02,860 --> 02:30:05,860
and we'll open up the Skype line again for those of you guys who want to get through and comment.

1870
02:30:05,860 --> 02:30:06,860
Excuse me.

1871
02:30:06,860 --> 02:30:11,860
So send in your questions for Ask Orange Lounge over private message to Sky in the chat room right now.

1872
02:30:11,860 --> 02:30:14,860
In this break, I think we'll do some songs from 2DX.

1873
02:30:14,860 --> 02:30:21,860
Just some 2DX potpourri. Enjoy.

1874
02:31:14,860 --> 02:31:15,860
I said you know what?!

1875
02:31:15,860 --> 02:31:16,860
It's late!

1876
02:31:16,860 --> 02:31:17,860
Free love and be free!

1877
02:31:17,860 --> 02:31:18,980
Free love and be free!

1878
02:31:18,980 --> 02:31:20,020
Free love and be free!

1879
02:31:20,020 --> 02:31:21,400
Free love and be free!

1880
02:31:21,400 --> 02:31:23,040
Free love and be free!

1881
02:31:23,040 --> 02:31:24,460
Free love and be free!

1882
02:31:24,460 --> 02:31:25,820
Free love and be free!

1883
02:31:25,840 --> 02:31:27,580
Free love and be free!

1884
02:31:27,580 --> 02:31:29,780
Free love and be free!

1885
02:31:29,780 --> 02:31:31,260
Free love and be free!

1886
02:31:31,260 --> 02:31:32,520
Free love and be free!

1887
02:31:32,520 --> 02:31:33,800
Free love and be free!

1888
02:31:33,800 --> 02:31:35,080
Free love and be free!

1889
02:31:35,080 --> 02:31:36,600
Free love and be free!

1890
02:31:36,600 --> 02:31:37,620
Free love and be free!

1891
02:31:37,620 --> 02:31:38,840
Free love and be free!

1892
02:31:38,840 --> 02:31:40,140
Free love and be free!

1893
02:31:40,140 --> 02:31:41,340
Free love and be free!

1894
02:31:41,340 --> 02:31:43,020
Free love and be free!

1895
02:31:43,020 --> 02:31:44,520
Free love and be free!

1896
02:32:14,520 --> 02:32:16,520
Thanks for watching!

1897
02:33:14,520 --> 02:33:20,520
One day, one day

1898
02:33:20,520 --> 02:33:23,520
Monday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday

1899
02:33:23,520 --> 02:33:26,520
With the cynical boom in the back of my neck

1900
02:33:26,520 --> 02:33:29,520
I get blinded every day

1901
02:33:29,520 --> 02:33:30,520
I can do it

1902
02:33:30,520 --> 02:33:31,520
I can do it

1903
02:33:31,520 --> 02:33:49,940
Kind of you

1904
02:33:49,940 --> 02:33:54,820
Have you found

1905
02:33:54,820 --> 02:33:57,700
An enemy

1906
02:33:57,700 --> 02:34:11,700
Ooh, oh, you and I, won't let go, won't let go

1907
02:34:57,700 --> 02:34:59,700
Let's go!

1908
02:35:57,700 --> 02:36:24,700
Orange Lounge Radio, we put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.

1909
02:36:24,700 --> 02:36:27,460
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1910
02:36:27,460 --> 02:36:32,280
chat room has gone crazy. I was making some jokes during the break there, and now everybody's

1911
02:36:32,280 --> 02:36:36,980
talking about my pants. And I feel bad because there's a guy in there that really just needs

1912
02:36:36,980 --> 02:36:42,080
a hug right now, and the talk about my pants and my name in various Bomani games is eclipsing

1913
02:36:42,080 --> 02:36:48,000
that conversation, so I feel bad. Anyway, back to the dick and fart jokes we're talking

1914
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:51,540
about here on Orange Lounge Radio. No, seriously, I wanted to bring something up that Xplizit

1915
02:36:51,540 --> 02:36:56,480
was talking about during his FUs of the Week. I felt kind of bad for this guy over on The

1916
02:36:56,480 --> 02:36:59,700
the freak who had posted something in the NorCal forums, are there any other gay people

1917
02:36:59,700 --> 02:37:05,400
that play DDR? And people just kind of, like when you jump down this guy's throat going,

1918
02:37:05,400 --> 02:37:10,680
it doesn't matter! Why are you posting this shit? It shouldn't matter! And you know what?

1919
02:37:10,680 --> 02:37:14,440
They're right. It shouldn't matter. And the way the guy had kind of worded the original

1920
02:37:14,440 --> 02:37:18,000
post, he was kind of throwing out some facts that were a little crazy and stuff like that.

1921
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:22,920
But, I was kind of trying to look at it from his point of view. And as somebody who happens

1922
02:37:22,920 --> 02:37:25,880
to be a gay male, and if you listen to the show by now, it's no secret to you that I

1923
02:37:25,880 --> 02:37:33,080
happen to be a homosexual no I mean I know and I know a lot of people don't

1924
02:37:33,080 --> 02:37:38,600
like that so like homophobia is so 90s okay seriously I think a lot of people

1925
02:37:38,600 --> 02:37:42,400
truly don't give a crap anymore and granted it's not gone completely I think

1926
02:37:42,400 --> 02:37:47,920
the last election shows that where what what is this I'm trying to see your I am

1927
02:37:47,920 --> 02:37:56,960
window here oh god more pants chat thank you very much no it doesn't but I kind

1928
02:37:56,960 --> 02:38:01,240
of feel bad for the guy because when you are gay sometimes it is hard to meet

1929
02:38:01,240 --> 02:38:04,520
people in the same way that straight people kind of meet each other and

1930
02:38:04,520 --> 02:38:07,200
especially if you're the kind of person that's had an upbringing where you've

1931
02:38:07,200 --> 02:38:10,200
had to be very sheltered and closeted and kind of secretive about your

1932
02:38:10,200 --> 02:38:14,800
lifestyle sometimes you just kind of want to fly out of the closet and meet

1933
02:38:14,800 --> 02:38:19,320
as many people as you can that are like you. So I kind of understand where he's coming

1934
02:38:19,320 --> 02:38:22,920
from a little bit, where it is hard. You can't just walk up to people on the street and go,

1935
02:38:22,920 --> 02:38:29,920
hey, you gay? I know it's happened to all of you before, but it's not very nice.

1936
02:38:30,160 --> 02:38:36,160
Hey, girl, you want to grow up with me? But seriously, if you're gay, just talk to people.

1937
02:38:36,160 --> 02:38:41,760
It doesn't matter if you're gay or not. Where I think the guy may have made a mistake is

1938
02:38:41,760 --> 02:38:47,360
is maybe DDR Freak just isn't maybe the place. People want to talk DDR on DDR Freak. They

1939
02:38:47,360 --> 02:38:50,120
don't want to talk about, you know. But I think he was just looking for gay people who

1940
02:38:50,120 --> 02:38:53,360
are into DDR. So I PM'd him to Lynx because there's actually a live drone community that's

1941
02:38:53,360 --> 02:38:57,480
like gay DDR players. There's gay gamers, get it? Gamers communities and stuff like

1942
02:38:57,480 --> 02:38:58,480
that, so.

1943
02:38:58,480 --> 02:39:01,000
Well, yeah. It's okay to post on the NorCal and stuff, but I mean, you see that all the

1944
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:05,480
time in DDR chit chat and stuff and general discussion. Like, you see, like, hundreds

1945
02:39:05,480 --> 02:39:07,200
of topics like that and...

1946
02:39:07,200 --> 02:39:18,200
Now, yeah, and I agree. Now, it's almost, almost, it's very similar to the girls that play DDR topic, because for whatever reason, now, there's a difference, though. There's a difference.

1947
02:39:18,200 --> 02:39:31,200
When it's a guy posting, are there any girls that play DDR? That's one thing. Yeah, exactly. That's just, you know, somebody who's sitting there downloading Violent Hypergirls freestyle videos.

1948
02:39:31,200 --> 02:39:39,020
love you Aaron love you Aaron and but when it's a girl posting are there other

1949
02:39:39,020 --> 02:39:41,940
girls that play DDR well then you know you're just kind of like okay well maybe

1950
02:39:41,940 --> 02:39:45,700
you know it's kind of too bad that there aren't a lot of girls that you know go

1951
02:39:45,700 --> 02:39:48,480
out to the arcade and but I think DDR has been bringing more I think there's

1952
02:39:48,480 --> 02:39:51,860
been more and more but just in the past there's more and more now but

1953
02:39:51,860 --> 02:39:54,460
especially when I first started playing there wasn't a whole lot that I would

1954
02:39:54,460 --> 02:39:57,780
see their case back in the days before DDR when I would play pinball I maybe

1955
02:39:57,780 --> 02:39:59,780
maybe once or twice saw a girl at the arcade.

1956
02:39:59,780 --> 02:40:02,780
I only saw one girl back then, but now I see like a bunch of girls.

1957
02:40:02,780 --> 02:40:06,780
Well, I'm not sure if it's because of the F.U. tournament I helped organize in Sacramento

1958
02:40:06,780 --> 02:40:11,780
or just the whole tournament issues nowadays that people want to get involved with.

1959
02:40:11,780 --> 02:40:14,780
When I see girls posting that on the ZDR Freak forums, I think,

1960
02:40:14,780 --> 02:40:16,780
Ooh, lesbians!

1961
02:40:16,780 --> 02:40:18,780
That's what I think.

1962
02:40:18,780 --> 02:40:22,780
You're a little girl, girl-on-girl mix.

1963
02:40:22,780 --> 02:40:26,780
Jamie, do you have anything you want to add to this horrible discussion?

1964
02:40:26,780 --> 02:40:28,780
Your pants are hot.

1965
02:40:28,780 --> 02:40:30,780
Shove it.

1966
02:40:31,780 --> 02:40:34,780
I know this is very late. It's another F.U.

1967
02:40:34,780 --> 02:40:37,780
F.U. to splitting my pants open this morning.

1968
02:40:37,780 --> 02:40:39,780
That sucks.

1969
02:40:39,780 --> 02:40:42,780
I was reaching for something and all of a sudden I heard this rip

1970
02:40:42,780 --> 02:40:44,780
and there was my crotch exposed.

1971
02:40:44,780 --> 02:40:45,780
Oh, speaking of rip...

1972
02:40:45,780 --> 02:40:47,780
You know what that means, right? You fat.

1973
02:40:48,780 --> 02:40:52,780
No, what it means is that I was laying on my pants and trying to stretch at the same time.

1974
02:40:52,780 --> 02:40:59,780
time. It does not mean I'm fat, you dumbass. That's explicit. Did you get something you

1975
02:40:59,780 --> 02:41:02,620
wanted to say? No, I'm not going to comment on the look in that one. Well then fine, you're

1976
02:41:02,620 --> 02:41:08,220
fat too. Look, it does look fat. I just showed you my stomach, do I look fat? You're going

1977
02:41:08,220 --> 02:41:14,180
to make me straight, God. Alright, you know there's a cam right there. Oh, okay. Oh,

1978
02:41:14,180 --> 02:41:16,180
Look at my foot!

1979
02:41:20,180 --> 02:41:23,180
Okay, sorry if it scares people for that.

1980
02:41:23,180 --> 02:41:25,180
I'm changing the subject.

1981
02:41:29,180 --> 02:41:32,180
Let's ask OrangeLounge some stupid questions.

1982
02:41:32,180 --> 02:41:36,180
What will we find out this week on OrangeLoungeRadio?

1983
02:41:36,180 --> 02:41:40,180
One thing we won't find out because he already said,

1984
02:41:40,180 --> 02:41:47,180
Loki split his pants today, therefore he must be fat.

1985
02:41:50,180 --> 02:41:52,820
You know, the butcher's knife is still clean.

1986
02:41:52,820 --> 02:41:57,620
It's one of the only dishes that's not dirty yet.

1987
02:41:57,620 --> 02:42:01,060
Sigurd has a question starting it off. This will make you feel better, Loki.

1988
02:42:01,060 --> 02:42:07,220
Who is your favorite drawn together character and why?

1989
02:42:07,220 --> 02:42:10,120
Mine is Xander for obvious reasons.

1990
02:42:10,120 --> 02:42:13,200
Mine is Nolan because I have a life and don't watch TV.

1991
02:42:13,200 --> 02:42:17,120
Oh my god, that's such a tough question.

1992
02:42:17,120 --> 02:42:19,720
Oh man, uh...

1993
02:42:19,720 --> 02:42:23,800
I would have to say Ling Ling. I love Ling Ling and just how

1994
02:42:23,800 --> 02:42:25,800
funny and Japanese it is.

1995
02:42:25,800 --> 02:42:29,840
And just like, it's more of like two characters.

1996
02:42:29,840 --> 02:42:33,340
It's Spanky and Ling Ling, their interactive

1997
02:42:33,340 --> 02:42:36,680
interactions. That's the best part, you know.

1998
02:42:36,680 --> 02:42:40,860
but Ling Ling's hilarious and um...

1999
02:42:40,860 --> 02:42:44,900
Are you looking for the Christmas?

2000
02:42:44,900 --> 02:42:47,940
Well, too bad there's not a Santa Claus.

2001
02:42:47,940 --> 02:42:51,020
Let's see, it was Xander who said that.

2002
02:42:51,020 --> 02:42:53,840
I would say my second favorite would be Foxy Love.

2003
02:42:53,840 --> 02:42:56,720
I love Foxy Love.

2004
02:42:56,720 --> 02:42:58,320
Bleh.

2005
02:42:58,320 --> 02:43:00,920
Anyway.

2006
02:43:00,920 --> 02:43:03,180
Uh, next question from MPQ.

2007
02:43:03,180 --> 02:43:07,100
How many people care about the song Cartoon Heroes? It seems to me

2008
02:43:07,100 --> 02:43:09,220
that people actually want the steps

2009
02:43:09,220 --> 02:43:10,560
rather than the song.

2010
02:43:10,560 --> 02:43:13,780
Do you think it would work if they took the steps and then put them on a hundred and seventy

2011
02:43:13,780 --> 02:43:16,240
beat-per-minute Konami original or something?

2012
02:43:16,240 --> 02:43:20,180
That's the one thing I can kind of see about Cartoon Heroes, why so many people want that song.

2013
02:43:20,180 --> 02:43:23,660
That's my point before. Is it the steps? Okay, that's fine. That's my point.

2014
02:43:23,660 --> 02:43:27,340
And I don't think it would work on any other song. I mean, it would just be weird.

2015
02:43:27,340 --> 02:43:31,920
So if Cartoon Heroes was like a seven-footer and had very easy steps, no one would play it.

2016
02:43:31,920 --> 02:43:37,920
But see, I don't... You're cutting out a little bit. He's saying something about the fact that if it was a 7-footer, not as many people would play it.

2017
02:43:37,920 --> 02:43:43,920
I somewhat disagree. I think there's people that play it because they play Speed Over Beethoven as well. You know, that whole type of thing.

2018
02:43:43,920 --> 02:43:46,920
Or we could say if the song was...

2019
02:43:48,920 --> 02:43:53,920
Yeah, if it goes 140 BPM, then no one would play it at all.

2020
02:43:53,920 --> 02:43:57,920
Think of the songs that are over 170 BPM being overplayed.

2021
02:43:57,920 --> 02:44:02,920
This is my thing, and this is the same thing when people ask, why aren't there enough 10-footers in DDR?

2022
02:44:02,920 --> 02:44:07,920
Can you really play 10-footers on a homepad? I mean, if you can and you're passing them, good for you.

2023
02:44:07,920 --> 02:44:14,920
But you are in a minority. Let's face it, you are in the minority if you can pass those kinds of songs on a homepad.

2024
02:44:14,920 --> 02:44:21,920
Do you think all songs must be 10-footers? Oh, let's go, duh-duh-duh-duh-duh, every freaking song.

2025
02:44:21,920 --> 02:44:26,920
That's why you can make edits if you don't like the steps. Simple question.

2026
02:44:26,920 --> 02:44:32,920
Or just play in the groove and just hammer the machine so much so your feet dies and shit.

2027
02:44:32,920 --> 02:44:36,920
Okay, if there's one thing I'm not doing at home, it's hamplants. End of story.

2028
02:44:36,920 --> 02:44:40,920
Those fucking comments! Hamplants are so, like, 98.

2029
02:44:40,920 --> 02:44:46,920
Hamplants are so ancient. Civilization. We don't go around kung-kung-kung.

2030
02:44:46,920 --> 02:44:52,920
You're not for just rape. You don't need anyone to fight rape.

2031
02:44:52,920 --> 02:45:02,720
Darkknight, everyone must be at the computer or on the webcam because all I see is Bradley.

2032
02:45:02,720 --> 02:45:03,720
You're right.

2033
02:45:03,720 --> 02:45:08,800
Our webcam kind of needs a new angle, I think, because obviously a lot of us kind of hide

2034
02:45:08,800 --> 02:45:09,800
back here.

2035
02:45:09,800 --> 02:45:10,800
But not at me.

2036
02:45:10,800 --> 02:45:11,800
He needs a spotlight.

2037
02:45:11,800 --> 02:45:12,800
Yeah.

2038
02:45:12,800 --> 02:45:13,800
We're angels kind of hiding back here.

2039
02:45:13,800 --> 02:45:15,280
She's sitting on the ground next to Loki and I.

2040
02:45:15,280 --> 02:45:18,400
And I see that Angel has candy, so I'm going to steal some.

2041
02:45:18,400 --> 02:45:19,640
What the hell are you thinking?

2042
02:45:19,640 --> 02:45:20,640
Wait, what?

2043
02:45:20,640 --> 02:45:22,640
No, it's in the form of some Matrix wall.

2044
02:45:22,640 --> 02:45:27,640
I don't want to bring up another F.U., I just...

2045
02:45:27,640 --> 02:45:29,640
Fucking Natalie Portman for not getting naked.

2046
02:45:29,640 --> 02:45:31,640
I fucking hate that.

2047
02:45:31,640 --> 02:45:32,640
You don't go see a movie.

2048
02:45:32,640 --> 02:45:34,640
Okay, it's a fucking chick flick.

2049
02:45:34,640 --> 02:45:45,640
Now, granted, there are some very funny scenes in there, like the whole, um, uh, what was that, internet, um, like net porn type thing sequence that they had to classical music.

2050
02:45:45,640 --> 02:45:46,640
Now, that was funny.

2051
02:45:46,640 --> 02:45:48,640
That was the best part in the whole movie.

2052
02:45:48,640 --> 02:45:54,240
movie. But Natalie Portman was not fucking naked. They advertise this movie as her being

2053
02:45:54,240 --> 02:46:01,440
naked, and she was not naked. Why? Why? Why? So, she falls in the same category now as

2054
02:46:01,440 --> 02:46:08,200
the Olsen twins, whereas she needs to do porn. It's because I want to see her career tank.

2055
02:46:08,200 --> 02:46:09,200
Bye.

2056
02:46:09,200 --> 02:46:12,360
Alright, let's get to Dark Knight's real question here. That was just an observation he was

2057
02:46:12,360 --> 02:46:16,620
making here's a question here's a question for y'all if there was an

2058
02:46:16,620 --> 02:46:21,400
America Americanized Japanese show that you wouldn't that you would want to be

2059
02:46:21,400 --> 02:46:24,880
taken off the air which would it be

2060
02:46:25,080 --> 02:46:30,640
but that I have the perfect answer and you'll agree with me

2061
02:46:30,640 --> 02:46:37,440
Iron Chef America Oh God no we need more real Iron Chef Iron Chef needs to come

2062
02:46:37,440 --> 02:46:43,240
back on the air, the original. Damn it, we need the Chiba to come out of retirement and

2063
02:46:43,240 --> 02:46:49,000
kick all their asses. I absolutely agree, Iron Chef America. Bobby Flay is a fucking

2064
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:57,000
faggot, I hate him. Not in the gay way, not in the gay way, as in like, he sucks. As in

2065
02:46:57,000 --> 02:47:03,160
he's a bundle of sticks. Yes, a bundle of sticks. No, I fucking hate Bobby Flay, he's

2066
02:47:03,160 --> 02:47:08,580
little whiny bitch okay I was gonna say I was gonna say don't insult faggots

2067
02:47:08,580 --> 02:47:16,040
please all right let's do Zach who says okay my 2dx skills are what some would

2068
02:47:16,040 --> 02:47:19,600
say subpar how does one make the conversion from single-handed seven key

2069
02:47:19,600 --> 02:47:23,440
play to double handed play so that when I go out to play 2dx again I don't end

2070
02:47:23,440 --> 02:47:28,160
up sucking I think training mode on the home versions there's really good but

2071
02:47:28,160 --> 02:47:32,240
you said you don't have training mode so you're kind of screwed buddy I hate to

2072
02:47:32,240 --> 02:47:35,240
Honestly, you're just going to have to practice, practice, practice.

2073
02:47:35,240 --> 02:47:41,240
Arkadian, you play a lot of 2DX. Do you have any advice you could give to our buddy, Zaku, if we can hear you on that mic?

2074
02:47:41,240 --> 02:47:43,240
Practice. That's the only thing you really do.

2075
02:47:43,240 --> 02:47:49,240
There really is nothing else you can do. There's no trick. There's no wrist exercise or anything you can do. You just got to practice.

2076
02:47:49,240 --> 02:47:52,240
Play as many different songs on different levels as you can.

2077
02:47:52,240 --> 02:47:54,240
Exactly. Play songs you don't usually play.

2078
02:47:54,240 --> 02:48:00,240
Every time you go to play 2DX, make your last song something you've never played before that's about the same skill level, same star level.

2079
02:48:00,240 --> 02:48:02,240
the same star level. That's the only way you're going to get better.

2080
02:48:02,240 --> 02:48:06,720
I play things that are harder than you can do. I played the anothers and everything when

2081
02:48:06,720 --> 02:48:11,180
I first started out, even though I couldn't even get too close to passing them, just to

2082
02:48:11,180 --> 02:48:18,040
see them and try them out. Sooner or later you pass harder stuff.

2083
02:48:18,040 --> 02:48:25,720
Alright, let's move on. Blarg says, who would you rather have sex with? An 80 year old in

2084
02:48:25,720 --> 02:48:29,560
an 8-year-old's body or an 8-year-old in an 80-year-old's body?

2085
02:48:29,560 --> 02:48:38,560
That's the point where I go to Goldie's. You know, actually, I don't have to worry about

2086
02:48:38,560 --> 02:48:40,520
it. Yeah, yeah, you wouldn't have sex with a lady

2087
02:48:40,520 --> 02:48:44,040
anyway. Unless it was Margaret Cho.

2088
02:48:44,040 --> 02:48:48,880
I would with Margaret Cho. Would you rather have sex with an 8-year-old

2089
02:48:48,880 --> 02:48:51,640
in an 80-year-old's body or an 80-year-old in an 8-year-old's body?

2090
02:49:21,640 --> 02:49:26,100
Would you rather play ball in a field that has short grass or a field that's just like

2091
02:49:26,100 --> 02:49:33,800
turned to dust? Okay, I mean. Like, you're gonna have an unexperienced old chick, that's

2092
02:49:33,800 --> 02:49:40,000
just nasty. I mean, I'm sorry. But, if you think about it, not only are you robbing the

2093
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:45,840
cradle but you're fucking getting some older action at the same time. So it's like, it's

2094
02:49:45,840 --> 02:49:46,840
wrong.

2095
02:49:46,840 --> 02:49:51,960
Topic change real quick DJ Rama has says my question as I was rudely interrupted earlier tonight

2096
02:49:51,960 --> 02:49:56,600
I missed half the show, but I could have sworn I heard or duo pump on pokal in

2097
02:49:56,880 --> 02:50:03,320
Did I really hear that and where can I find that song? Yes, you did here or duro pomoklin and it is actually the version

2098
02:50:03,320 --> 02:50:05,320
Let me play a little clip of that for you guys

2099
02:50:07,860 --> 02:50:11,280
Yes, you did hear that and it's in DDR festival

2100
02:50:11,280 --> 02:50:16,080
DER festival is one of the songs in there so pick up the festival soundtrack I guess

2101
02:50:16,080 --> 02:50:20,500
if there is one. I don't think there is one yet. Or you can message Loki, he'll let you

2102
02:50:20,500 --> 02:50:27,800
know where to find it. You have to find out DER UK, it's very hard to find them.

2103
02:50:27,800 --> 02:50:33,280
Rob Maness also says Skye, similar stuff happens in the cosplay community, points to my posts

2104
02:50:33,280 --> 02:50:37,800
in the chat. I missed it, I'm sorry buddy, you gotta send it over private message or

2105
02:50:37,800 --> 02:50:48,540
I might miss it. What do you guys think about Song Pack 7,

2106
02:50:48,540 --> 02:50:54,800
worth buying? Yes, because I think it should support DDR and it's just five bucks. That's

2107
02:50:54,800 --> 02:51:00,100
like lunch at Burger King, it's not that bad. And the new remix is pretty kick ass and then

2108
02:51:00,100 --> 02:51:06,080
you can play Era against me online and Era is a good song. If you honestly are just not

2109
02:51:06,080 --> 02:51:09,860
into the remix. We played it for you guys later tonight. If you're just not feeling

2110
02:51:09,860 --> 02:51:13,780
the iFeel remix, then I guess maybe there isn't a whole lot for you to gain from this,

2111
02:51:13,780 --> 02:51:18,020
but I would say, you know what, buy it and just support DDR. Because the more people

2112
02:51:18,020 --> 02:51:25,020
that buy song packs, yeah, this is what you get for coming late. There's a new iFeel remix.

2113
02:51:25,020 --> 02:51:34,540
There's another iFeel, iFeel for being late. Alright. Okay, let's see. Illusion says, Jesus

2114
02:51:34,540 --> 02:51:39,300
came to me and said he loved me so I kissed him. I would like to ask your opinion if that

2115
02:51:39,300 --> 02:51:51,660
was too forward. Now does that make him gay or Jesus gay? Well maybe it was Jesus. I mean

2116
02:51:51,660 --> 02:51:57,340
you know maybe it wasn't the Jesus. Maybe it was some guy named Jesus you know. And

2117
02:51:57,340 --> 02:52:00,980
if he returned back to earth I think we have more things to worry about than your kiss.

2118
02:52:00,980 --> 02:52:14,340
you know I think Jesus would have just said thank you and then ran away yeah he

2119
02:52:14,340 --> 02:52:25,140
would forgive you for being a dirty homo sinner you would have inevitably undone

2120
02:52:25,140 --> 02:52:29,460
humanity because Jesus would then go to hell for being gay and the sinner and

2121
02:52:29,460 --> 02:52:36,460
And yeah, Earth would end and humanity would go away.

2122
02:52:36,460 --> 02:52:37,460
Anyways.

2123
02:52:37,460 --> 02:52:43,980
Well, we don't have any more questions from our chat room, oh no, I think we just got

2124
02:52:43,980 --> 02:52:44,980
another one.

2125
02:52:44,980 --> 02:52:49,860
But I am going to open up the Skype line here over on, excuse me, www.orangelandtrader.com,

2126
02:52:49,860 --> 02:52:51,300
click on interact with us.

2127
02:52:51,300 --> 02:52:58,780
DarkTetsuya says, I've been trying to dig up info on KR, Konami version, the karaoke

2128
02:52:58,780 --> 02:53:02,580
karaoke revolution konami version, but I only saw the small snippet on konami's site. Is

2129
02:53:02,580 --> 02:53:07,980
that all the info that's out there? Yes, I have only been hearing about this second-hand

2130
02:53:07,980 --> 02:53:12,780
kind of through Navi, the pop music whore, he's been kind of following this. From what

2131
02:53:12,780 --> 02:53:18,940
I understand, there is going to be a karaoke revolution Bamani version, not in the U.S.,

2132
02:53:18,940 --> 02:53:25,700
okay, it's a Japanese mix, and I guess it's just going to be something that is happening,

2133
02:53:25,700 --> 02:53:29,200
we don't know a whole lot about that, but there was questionnaires that happened already,

2134
02:53:29,200 --> 02:53:35,020
and folks could fill out those questionnaires, but that's all we know, right now. So, there's

2135
02:53:35,020 --> 02:53:39,060
nothing else we know that's going on with the Bomani edition as far as I know.

2136
02:53:39,060 --> 02:53:45,420
It's all about naha naha gachikun battle. That needs to be on there in duet mode. That

2137
02:53:45,420 --> 02:53:52,540
would be fucking awesome. No, but, you know what's cool? I'm eating gummy bears right

2138
02:53:52,540 --> 02:53:59,040
Now the fun thing you can do about these, you can bite them in half and lick one end of it, and stick it to stuff, and it'll stick there for a long time.

2139
02:53:59,040 --> 02:54:06,540
And if you stick it to someone's back window and they don't notice it, and when they try to peel it off, it's all slimy because of all the mildew- you know, the moist air outside.

2140
02:54:06,540 --> 02:54:07,540
It's really fun to do.

2141
02:54:09,540 --> 02:54:11,540
So bite a gummy bear in half, stick it to your friend...

2142
02:54:13,540 --> 02:54:15,040
How is that for random?

2143
02:54:16,540 --> 02:54:17,540
Wow.

2144
02:54:18,540 --> 02:54:19,540
Very interesting.

2145
02:54:19,540 --> 02:54:24,940
Sigh. I guess it's time to start wrapping up this show you guys, the show's just about-

2146
02:54:24,940 --> 02:54:27,540
And rubbings and booze. And balls.

2147
02:54:27,540 --> 02:54:38,540
Oh, oh, oh. Angel reminded me of something. Not so subtly. Okay, this is something I wanted to bring- I wanted to bring this up like in the first hour of the show and I totally forgot. Angel went and got a happy meal at McDonald's today.

2148
02:54:38,540 --> 02:54:39,540
I was hungry, you idiot!

2149
02:54:39,540 --> 02:54:40,540
What?

2150
02:54:40,540 --> 02:54:41,540
I was hungry.

2151
02:54:41,540 --> 02:54:44,540
There's no shame in a happy meal at the- at the happy meals.

2152
02:54:44,540 --> 02:54:45,540
There's no shame at all.

2153
02:54:45,540 --> 02:54:48,540
I saw Sonic and I'm like, hmm, maybe it's a figurine!

2154
02:54:48,540 --> 02:54:53,020
game! Yeah, exactly. It's a Sonic Happy Meal. I guess they teamed up with Sonic the Hedgehog

2155
02:54:53,020 --> 02:54:57,340
to do these Sonic Happy Meals at McDonald's right now. Look at this! She got a free little

2156
02:54:57,340 --> 02:55:02,020
game with hers. Like, these are the kind of games like Mr. Game & Watch. Tiger Toys! Yeah,

2157
02:55:02,020 --> 02:55:05,500
the Tiger Toys. You remember these? These used to be the things we would get for Christmas.

2158
02:55:05,500 --> 02:55:09,980
These shitty little, like, watch games that we would get for Christmas as a kid. And now

2159
02:55:09,980 --> 02:55:13,940
they're coming in freaking Happy Meals, and it's a little Sonic one, and it's basically

2160
02:55:13,940 --> 02:55:19,600
a ghetto version of the bonus stage from Sonic 2. But, my God, this is a Happy Meal toy.

2161
02:55:19,600 --> 02:55:24,340
I remember when we used to get shitty little wind-up toys and, like, little plushy things

2162
02:55:24,340 --> 02:55:29,980
and fucking Beanie Babies with Happy Meals. And now we get freaking video games with Sonic?

2163
02:55:29,980 --> 02:55:33,780
And when did Sonic start making a comeback in the U.S.? That's the other thing. Well,

2164
02:55:33,780 --> 02:55:36,860
I guess I've just been asleep. Yeah, that's right, he's got the cartoon. Okay, so I've

2165
02:55:36,860 --> 02:55:40,620
just been asleep. That's fine. I mean, Sonic's cool and all, so I'm glad that they're doing

2166
02:55:40,620 --> 02:55:45,300
a happy meal thing but man you get a freaking game like this is the kind of

2167
02:55:45,300 --> 02:55:48,300
stuff we would open up on Christmas Day and be excited about and now you get it

2168
02:55:48,300 --> 02:55:51,780
in a freaking happy meal what's up with that

2169
02:55:55,260 --> 02:55:58,140
is there something wait is there something you want to add to that Jamie

2170
02:55:58,140 --> 02:56:07,540
you're a sonic fan is this is this cool I understand how cool the free iPod

2171
02:56:07,540 --> 02:56:09,540
Don't start a threat about it!

2172
02:56:09,540 --> 02:56:17,660
god people they're giving them away for free does that tell you anything about

2173
02:56:17,660 --> 02:56:22,960
how crappy they are they're free they can toss them away

2174
02:56:22,960 --> 02:56:29,520
sad I love my iPod you shut your mouth we had a rap with the show boys and

2175
02:56:29,520 --> 02:56:36,220
girls next week on the show more randomness um in two weeks I'm gonna be

2176
02:56:36,220 --> 02:56:40,740
going to AI, Arcade Infinity, I'm making an LA trip. I'm hoping! I may not get to go for

2177
02:56:40,740 --> 02:56:44,760
sure, but that's kind of what I'm trying to do, is go to Arcade Infinity, um, probably

2178
02:56:44,760 --> 02:56:48,500
next Thursday. Not this coming Thursday, but next Thursday. So, I hope to see some of you

2179
02:56:48,500 --> 02:56:53,160
guys there, um, our stalker fans. That'll be fun. And my goal is to get a whole bunch

2180
02:56:53,160 --> 02:56:57,500
of EMUs cards and get them away on the show to those less fortunate who can't get them.

2181
02:56:57,500 --> 02:57:02,700
So, we'll see what happens with that. Um, anyway, next week on the show, more of the

2182
02:57:02,700 --> 02:57:06,100
same stuff. I'm gonna try and line up an interview for next week's show. I want to interview

2183
02:57:06,100 --> 02:57:10,040
somebody again. Hopefully a DDR artist, but maybe a DDR player if we can't get anything

2184
02:57:10,040 --> 02:57:15,400
else. So, more to come on that. Stay tuned to our website over at oranassonsradio.com

and stay tuned to our Live Gel community as well. Let's go around and get everybody's

2186
02:57:20,220 --> 02:57:26,060
final thought. Starting off with Loki. I'm afraid to say it, but this is my last show

2187
02:57:26,060 --> 02:57:31,620
that I'll be doing until next week. And, yeah, I gotta find something to do. I need to work

2188
02:57:31,620 --> 02:57:36,100
in my cabin this week, for sure. Today, I mean, this week's gonna be a crazy week and

2189
02:57:36,100 --> 02:57:40,300
my work's not gonna be too happy with me taking off another day on Thursday, but what the

2190
02:57:40,300 --> 02:57:45,500
hell with him? Oh! Actually, the, ah, fuck, that sucks! I'm supposed to get my check on

2191
02:57:45,500 --> 02:57:51,260
Tuesday. Oh, well, I'll have to wait. We get bonuses next week, so that's kind of cool.

2192
02:57:51,260 --> 02:57:56,740
If I have to buy gifts, and I think Nellie wants diamonds again, you know, fucking women

2193
02:57:56,740 --> 02:58:08,500
and their expensive gifts. Anyways, yeah, that's all. Next! Angel, your final thought.

2194
02:58:08,500 --> 02:58:15,220
Brock's Candy Company needs to be sued. For? Making these things damn good. God. What a

2195
02:58:15,220 --> 02:58:20,220
Maple Nut goodies. They're really good. They're very good. I've been snacking on them all

2196
02:58:20,220 --> 02:58:21,220
night.

2197
02:58:21,220 --> 02:58:23,220
Arcadia, on your final thought.

2198
02:58:23,220 --> 02:58:24,220
Can you hear me?

2199
02:58:24,220 --> 02:58:25,220
Yes.

2200
02:58:25,220 --> 02:58:30,220
Oh, okay. I only had one piece of sushi last night. I need more! More sushi!

2201
02:58:30,220 --> 02:58:35,220
I don't think Anita's listening anymore, but you need to go bang down her door.

2202
02:58:35,220 --> 02:58:40,220
Well, somewhere. I don't really need her. Unless she wants to make some more. That'd

2203
02:58:40,220 --> 02:58:41,220
be cool.

2204
02:58:41,220 --> 02:58:42,220
Sushi from somewhere.

2205
02:58:42,220 --> 02:58:43,220
Sushi's wonderful.

2206
02:58:43,220 --> 02:58:44,220
Anywhere.

2207
02:58:44,220 --> 02:59:10,500
I was thinking the other day, and this is very important, so everyone pay attention,

2208
02:59:10,500 --> 02:59:19,820
We haven't done a Qzernite in a while. We need to do one again. So, check on the forums,

2209
02:59:19,820 --> 02:59:25,580
or not the forums, but check on the live journal. There will be a new Qzernite, and we will

2210
02:59:25,580 --> 02:59:31,620
reign supreme again! Alright, I'm dead. Uh, explicit your final thought.

2211
02:59:31,620 --> 02:59:38,820
Well, if I wanted to get to work early, I should have just ran every fucking marathon

2212
02:59:38,820 --> 02:59:45,820
Runner over GTA style.

2213
03:00:08,820 --> 03:00:10,820
Good luck with those teriyaki, too.

2214
03:00:10,820 --> 03:00:12,820
Yeah, we'll do that. We need to have a staff meeting.

2215
03:00:12,820 --> 03:00:14,820
Staff meeting!

2216
03:00:14,820 --> 03:00:16,820
Uh, DarkSakura, your final thought?

2217
03:00:16,820 --> 03:00:18,820
I hate my allergies.

2218
03:00:18,820 --> 03:00:21,820
I hate your allergies, too.

2219
03:00:21,820 --> 03:00:23,820
My allergies hate you back, so yeah.

2220
03:00:23,820 --> 03:00:25,820
Okay, cool.

2221
03:00:25,820 --> 03:00:30,820
Alright. Final word of the show tonight. I'll give it to Angel, why not?

2222
03:00:32,820 --> 03:00:35,820
Damn brocks. Yeah, that's it.

2223
03:00:35,820 --> 03:00:36,820
It works.

2224
03:00:36,820 --> 03:00:42,820
That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.

2228
03:01:01,820 --> 03:01:20,820
Hanukkah is the festival of lights. Instead of one day of presents, we get eight presents.

2229
03:01:20,820 --> 03:01:27,820
But would you feel like the only kid in town without a Christmas tree?

2230
03:01:27,820 --> 03:01:39,820
Here's a new list of people who are Jewish, brought by you and me.

2231
03:01:39,820 --> 03:01:52,820
One known writer drinks mannish of his wine, then spins a dreidel with Ralph Lauren and Calvin Klein.

2232
03:01:52,820 --> 03:01:58,620
Yeshu gives and receives loads of Hanukkah toys

2233
03:01:58,620 --> 03:02:05,120
The girls from Baruch HaStal and all three Beastie Boys

2234
03:02:05,120 --> 03:02:11,020
Lenny Kravitz is half Jewish, Courtney Love is half Jew

2235
03:02:11,020 --> 03:02:20,820
Put them together, what a funky badass Jew

2236
03:02:20,820 --> 03:02:26,820
We got Harvey Keitel and Flash dancer Jennifer Bills

2237
03:02:26,820 --> 03:02:29,820
Yasmin bleeds from Baywatch is Jewish

2238
03:02:29,820 --> 03:02:32,820
And yes, her boobs are real

2239
03:02:32,820 --> 03:02:35,820
Hold on, Natty Amaka

2240
03:02:35,820 --> 03:02:38,820
It's time for Monica

2241
03:02:38,820 --> 03:02:42,820
Two-time Oscar winner Dustin Huff Monica

2242
03:02:42,820 --> 03:02:45,820
Celebrate Monica

2243
03:02:45,820 --> 03:02:56,820
Old J. Simpson, still not a Jew, but guess who is? The guy who does the voice for Scooby-Doo.

2244
03:02:56,820 --> 03:03:03,820
Rob Dylan was born a Jew, then he wasn't, but now he's back.

2245
03:03:03,820 --> 03:03:09,820
Mary Tyler Moore's husband is Jewish, cause we're pretty good in the sack.

2246
03:03:09,820 --> 03:03:16,820
Guess who got bar mitzvahed on the PGA Tour?

2247
03:03:16,820 --> 03:03:22,820
No, I'm not talking about Tiger Woods, I'm talking about Mr. Happy Gilmore.

2248
03:03:27,820 --> 03:03:33,820
So many Jews are in the show mitzvah

2249
03:03:33,820 --> 03:03:38,820
Pro Springsteen isn't Jewish, but my mother thinks he is

2250
03:03:39,820 --> 03:03:42,820
Tell the whole of Monica

2251
03:03:42,820 --> 03:03:45,820
It's time to celebrate, Monica

2252
03:03:45,820 --> 03:03:48,820
It's not pronounced, Monica

2253
03:03:48,820 --> 03:03:51,820
The sea is silent in Hanukkah

2254
03:03:51,820 --> 03:03:54,820
So raise your hopes up, Monica

2255
03:03:54,820 --> 03:03:57,820
Get drunk and see a Wanukkah

2256
03:03:57,820 --> 03:04:00,820
If you really want to go

2257
03:04:00,820 --> 03:04:08,820
Happy Hanukkah!

2258
03:04:09,820 --> 03:04:11,820
Happy Hanukkah!

2259
03:04:11,820 --> 03:04:17,920
