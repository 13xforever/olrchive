31
00:03:28,182 --> 00:03:31,024
[SPEAKER_21]: Because we just had an 80s pre-show and it kind of ties into that.

00:03:37,749 --> 00:03:41,351

[SPEAKER_08]: One!

46
00:08:38,544 --> 00:08:47,891
[SPEAKER_16]: And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.

47
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:52,732
[SPEAKER_21]: Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bomani Music and More program.

48
00:08:52,772 --> 00:08:53,732
[SPEAKER_21]: Can we talk about that?

49
00:08:54,012 --> 00:08:56,373
[SPEAKER_09]: No subject will ever be taboo.

50
00:08:56,633 --> 00:09:00,274
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I was thinking maybe we should move Pump Up the Volume from Tuesday Nights.

51
00:09:00,794 --> 00:09:03,335
[SPEAKER_21]: Except, of course, a subject that was just under discussion.

52
00:09:03,855 --> 00:09:09,197
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?

53
00:09:09,738 --> 00:09:11,018
[SPEAKER_09]: I collect your fucking head.

54
00:09:13,001 --> 00:09:14,502
[SPEAKER_10]: Just like this fucker here.

55
00:09:16,664 --> 00:09:19,265
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki?

56
00:09:19,546 --> 00:09:22,948
[SPEAKER_08]: The hot thing on episode 69 was just a joke!

57
00:09:23,889 --> 00:09:30,373
[SPEAKER_08]: Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!

58
00:09:31,534 --> 00:09:35,337
[SPEAKER_16]: Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.

59
00:09:38,299 --> 00:09:41,381
[SPEAKER_21]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

60
00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:44,930
[SPEAKER_21]: The lovely and wonderful Jamie there in that promo.

61
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,031
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, sort of.

62
00:09:46,051 --> 00:09:48,592
[SPEAKER_03]: I was played by Lucy Liu.

63
00:09:49,332 --> 00:09:50,013
[SPEAKER_21]: You remember that?

64
00:09:50,073 --> 00:09:50,953
[SPEAKER_21]: A long time ago.

65
00:09:51,293 --> 00:09:54,034
[SPEAKER_21]: This was probably the first year of Orange Lounge Radio.

66
00:09:54,815 --> 00:09:57,876
[SPEAKER_21]: It's sad that that could be considered retro, but it really is.

67
00:09:58,136 --> 00:10:03,939
[SPEAKER_21]: You remember way back during the first year of this program when somebody had talked about... I want to say it was Dark Tetsuya was somehow involved with this.

68
00:10:04,299 --> 00:10:07,321
[SPEAKER_21]: Brought up the casting of the Orange Lounge movie.

69
00:10:08,413 --> 00:10:12,236
[SPEAKER_21]: And they took votes in the chat room and they said that you should be played by Lucy Liu.

70
00:10:12,957 --> 00:10:13,778
[SPEAKER_05]: How ironic.

71
00:10:13,898 --> 00:10:15,179
[SPEAKER_21]: Which is, yeah, how ironic.

72
00:10:15,359 --> 00:10:16,660
[SPEAKER_05]: A little too ironic.

73
00:10:16,961 --> 00:10:19,002
[SPEAKER_21]: Especially considering you're not Asian at all.

74
00:10:19,643 --> 00:10:21,825
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but, you know what?

75
00:10:22,826 --> 00:10:24,687
[SPEAKER_05]: I finally got something new when I went to Alabama.

76
00:10:25,248 --> 00:10:27,650
[SPEAKER_21]: That would be like me being played by Denzel Washington.

77
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:30,432
[SPEAKER_21]: That's funny.

78
00:10:30,512 --> 00:10:31,033
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway, sorry.

79
00:10:31,373 --> 00:10:31,994
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, Alabama.

80
00:10:32,094 --> 00:10:35,076
[SPEAKER_05]: I got, I believe it was, I thought you were taller.

81
00:10:36,485 --> 00:10:38,166
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, this is a good segue.

82
00:10:38,186 --> 00:10:42,628
[SPEAKER_21]: We've got to get into how was your week, how was your day, because I've got to figure out about what this is all about.

83
00:10:42,688 --> 00:10:43,809
[SPEAKER_21]: So, Jamie, how was your week, how was your day?

84
00:10:44,669 --> 00:10:47,250
[SPEAKER_05]: My couple of weeks were pretty decent.

85
00:10:47,591 --> 00:10:50,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Very, very, very, very, very, very busy.

86
00:10:51,553 --> 00:10:51,953
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

87
00:10:52,453 --> 00:10:54,814
[SPEAKER_05]: With my trip to Alabama, I got there.

88
00:10:55,134 --> 00:10:58,056
[SPEAKER_05]: My mom got us lost on the way from New Orleans.

89
00:10:58,496 --> 00:11:00,497
[SPEAKER_05]: We ended up heading up toward Hattiesburg.

90
00:11:02,238 --> 00:11:03,699
[SPEAKER_05]: There's something stuck in this thing.

91
00:11:03,719 --> 00:11:05,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, we ended up going up to Hattiesburg.

92
00:11:06,638 --> 00:11:09,981
[SPEAKER_05]: And then right when mom realized where we were, we had to go around a different way, so we headed home.

93
00:11:12,003 --> 00:11:14,165
[SPEAKER_05]: Got there, I didn't get in bed until 6 in the morning central.

94
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:20,712
[SPEAKER_05]: That means I had been up an official 24 hours because I woke up at 4 Pacific in the morning.

95
00:11:20,732 --> 00:11:21,332
[SPEAKER_21]: Congratulations.

96
00:11:22,814 --> 00:11:23,494
[SPEAKER_05]: My house crashed.

97
00:11:24,635 --> 00:11:28,079
[SPEAKER_05]: Next day was Thanksgiving, but we didn't do Thanksgiving stuff, we just slept.

98
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:29,921
[SPEAKER_05]: And...

99
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Did some hanging out, you know, it was pretty cool.

100
00:11:35,992 --> 00:11:40,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Then on Friday I went to Dothan, saw my daddy, my Uncle Dale.

101
00:11:41,374 --> 00:11:43,595
[SPEAKER_05]: My Uncle Dale and my daddy are having their second childhoods.

102
00:11:44,315 --> 00:11:46,396
[SPEAKER_05]: My Uncle Dale has a... A.K.A.

103
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:47,897
[SPEAKER_21]: midlife crisis.

104
00:11:48,137 --> 00:11:48,897
[SPEAKER_05]: 2004 Mustang GT.

105
00:11:49,717 --> 00:11:50,818
[SPEAKER_05]: My daddy has a Camaro.

106
00:11:53,351 --> 00:11:58,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, my daddy is cute on the internet because they have this old 500 megahertz kind of crappy thing.

107
00:11:59,695 --> 00:12:05,959
[SPEAKER_05]: And my daddy is so cute playing on it because he just hunts and pecks for the little keys and it's so cute.

108
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:11,042
[SPEAKER_05]: And my daddy sends me everything in 72-point font and email.

109
00:12:12,783 --> 00:12:13,343
[SPEAKER_21]: It's adorable.

110
00:12:13,464 --> 00:12:15,245
[SPEAKER_21]: I used to be that way on AOL Instant Messenger.

111
00:12:15,285 --> 00:12:18,527
[SPEAKER_21]: I would type to everybody in huge 72-point font and they'd be like, knock it off!

112
00:12:20,663 --> 00:12:24,845
[SPEAKER_21]: but I figured my chats are very important and I want to make sure they're not missed.

113
00:12:26,866 --> 00:12:34,811
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, so Saturday we had our official Thanksgiving at my uncle's house and we had fried turkey

114
00:12:36,556 --> 00:12:38,217
[SPEAKER_21]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

115
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:07,907
[SPEAKER_05]: But I had a really good time.

116
00:13:07,927 --> 00:13:18,975
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that night I went to Ground Zero, which is a sort of a... Okay, it's like a comic book store with gaming tables.

117
00:13:19,355 --> 00:13:20,736
[SPEAKER_05]: There were lots of people playing Yu-Gi-Oh!

118
00:13:20,756 --> 00:13:21,897
[SPEAKER_05]: and I felt really nerdy.

119
00:13:22,557 --> 00:13:25,939
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, but downstairs there's like an arcade there.

120
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:26,520
[SPEAKER_05]: It was pretty cool.

121
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:30,782
[SPEAKER_21]: That's a very strange name for an arcade in light of recent events.

122
00:13:31,663 --> 00:13:32,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't it great?

123
00:13:33,264 --> 00:13:33,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

124
00:13:34,745 --> 00:13:48,334
[SPEAKER_05]: But there was a DDR Extreme, there was a 4th Solo, there was a... 4th Solo, that's hot.

125
00:13:48,354 --> 00:13:49,595
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a Virtual On.

126
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:52,097
[SPEAKER_05]: I played the hell out of Virtual On.

127
00:13:52,557 --> 00:13:53,578
[SPEAKER_05]: And a Super Pac-Man.

128
00:13:54,599 --> 00:13:57,080
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh my god, so one of my favorite... And I had a Dance Maniacs.

129
00:13:57,721 --> 00:13:58,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, cool.

130
00:13:59,322 --> 00:14:01,463
[SPEAKER_05]: And a Beatmania 6 mix.

131
00:14:02,668 --> 00:14:03,508
[SPEAKER_05]: And Keyboard Mania 3rd

132
00:14:24,324 --> 00:14:25,705
[SPEAKER_05]: I met quite a few people.

133
00:14:25,785 --> 00:14:30,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I met the... I'm supposing that he's in charge of the machines there.

134
00:14:30,548 --> 00:14:32,689
[SPEAKER_05]: He goes by Pyramus Online.

135
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:34,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Very, very cool guy.

136
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,772
[SPEAKER_05]: I went to a... I went to a Bomani party!

137
00:14:37,192 --> 00:14:37,412
[SPEAKER_21]: What?

138
00:14:37,893 --> 00:14:39,273
[SPEAKER_21]: You went to a Bomani party?

139
00:14:39,453 --> 00:14:39,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

140
00:14:40,454 --> 00:14:42,595
[SPEAKER_21]: You just randomly got invited to a Bomani party down there?

141
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:47,839
[SPEAKER_05]: They were all heading over, so I went over and played Ace Style on a widescreen TV, and that was rad.

142
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:48,639
[SPEAKER_21]: Very nice.

143
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:49,520
[SPEAKER_21]: So, you just...

144
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,383
[SPEAKER_21]: You went over to strangers' houses to play video games?

145
00:14:52,403 --> 00:14:56,509
[SPEAKER_05]: He actually lived about a block away from where my extra mates lived.

146
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:58,552
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was very close.

147
00:14:59,373 --> 00:15:04,640
[SPEAKER_05]: And I went over, of course, to hang out with my mama's son and my papa's son.

148
00:15:05,661 --> 00:15:09,625
[SPEAKER_05]: and Kay Kitty and Bobby and we had a pretty good time.

149
00:15:09,945 --> 00:15:10,826
[SPEAKER_05]: We watched movies.

150
00:15:11,326 --> 00:15:16,511
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw The End of the Day After Tomorrow and no offense but that movie sucks.

151
00:15:17,712 --> 00:15:21,755
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think... That's my very professional opinion.

152
00:15:21,775 --> 00:15:23,437
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know a lot of people are going to disagree with you there.

153
00:15:23,477 --> 00:15:24,358
[SPEAKER_05]: My mom loves the movie.

154
00:15:24,578 --> 00:15:25,238
[SPEAKER_05]: They love the movie.

155
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:28,661
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really want to put down anyone else's opinion of it but my opinion of it is crap.

156
00:15:29,702 --> 00:15:29,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

157
00:15:31,904 --> 00:15:41,150
[SPEAKER_05]: We also, I learned the fine art of DVD duplication, and so I was able to deliver a copy of Kill Bill Volume 2.

158
00:15:41,531 --> 00:15:43,072
[SPEAKER_19]: Orange Linger does not advocate piracy.

159
00:15:43,132 --> 00:15:45,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, he did.

160
00:15:46,474 --> 00:16:00,183
[SPEAKER_05]: And I got, actually, you know, there's that show, Kindred the Embraced, that came on, based off of the White Wolf Universe, and I have all the episodes they ever made of that, because I think that the actor died, the main guy, who's playing the prince.

161
00:16:02,025 --> 00:16:08,494
[SPEAKER_05]: But, um, I have all of that, I still have it on my, uh If anyone brings me DVDs, you'll get copies Um

162
00:16:09,406 --> 00:16:11,087
[SPEAKER_21]: Orange Sounds Radio does not advocate piracy.

163
00:16:11,607 --> 00:16:14,168
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually, no, they're not... I'm just teasing.

164
00:16:14,968 --> 00:16:15,949
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not licensed right now.

165
00:16:15,969 --> 00:16:20,311
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I want to find out more about this Bramante party because basically you went over to a stranger's house.

166
00:16:21,191 --> 00:16:22,232
[SPEAKER_21]: I sang, Rob.

167
00:16:22,292 --> 00:16:25,173
[SPEAKER_21]: People that stalk us on the internet, right?

168
00:16:25,753 --> 00:16:27,714
[SPEAKER_05]: You got invited... A few people are our listeners.

169
00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:30,976
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, okay, so message to our listeners, stalking us works.

170
00:16:31,716 --> 00:16:36,238
[SPEAKER_05]: And... I just hung out with a lot of... A lot of the people, though, were people from DDR Freak.

171
00:16:36,558 --> 00:16:37,238
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, no, that's cool.

172
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:38,099
[SPEAKER_21]: But, yeah, I mean, you got...

173
00:16:39,096 --> 00:16:44,238
[SPEAKER_21]: You've got the moderatorship on DDR Freak, so a lot of people know who you are over there.

174
00:16:44,538 --> 00:16:50,781
[SPEAKER_21]: The show's getting pretty big over there, thanks to the syndication on Friday nights over there on Freak Radio.

175
00:16:51,121 --> 00:16:52,542
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just a bunch of people.

176
00:16:52,562 --> 00:16:53,722
[SPEAKER_05]: I met a lot of good people.

177
00:16:55,743 --> 00:16:58,404
[SPEAKER_05]: We basically were just playing 8th style.

178
00:16:58,424 --> 00:17:01,326
[SPEAKER_05]: We brought out Karaoke Revolution.

179
00:17:02,935 --> 00:17:04,436
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, you don't sing karaoke.

180
00:17:04,576 --> 00:17:07,898
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't, but I got the line from Adventures in Babysitting.

181
00:17:08,798 --> 00:17:10,819
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody leaves without singing the blues.

182
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,101
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's all it took?

183
00:17:14,141 --> 00:17:16,122
[SPEAKER_21]: They didn't have to feed you Guinness or anything?

184
00:17:16,222 --> 00:17:17,522
[SPEAKER_21]: I was begged.

185
00:17:17,783 --> 00:17:19,503
[SPEAKER_21]: They didn't make you drink Guinness or anything?

186
00:17:19,704 --> 00:17:20,964
[SPEAKER_21]: You just did it perfectly sober?

187
00:17:20,984 --> 00:17:24,086
[SPEAKER_05]: I just figured it was going to be about another year before I'm back.

188
00:17:24,886 --> 00:17:29,028
[SPEAKER_21]: And you knew that there were no recording devices present, so... So I sang Bizarre Love Triangle.

189
00:17:29,128 --> 00:17:29,909
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, no, that's a good song.

190
00:17:30,289 --> 00:17:30,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

191
00:17:30,888 --> 00:17:33,471
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, see, you missed some karaoke action here on the show last week.

192
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:34,673
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I didn't miss it.

193
00:17:34,693 --> 00:17:35,093
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

194
00:17:37,136 --> 00:17:37,396
[SPEAKER_21]: Thing.

195
00:17:37,636 --> 00:17:37,917
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

196
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:45,266
[SPEAKER_21]: No, I actually, I was really... Loki's still pissed at me over it, by the way.

197
00:17:46,514 --> 00:18:15,019
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually was going to be trying to tune in on my laptop, but I had promised my mama-son I was going to take her to see The Grudge, which after having, since I was glad I saw Ju-on first, very glad I saw it first, because then, it was neat noting the differences in the movie, I'm not going to spoil it for anyone who hasn't, and actually, the thing that pissed me off is that I don't know the reason why they think they have to explain every single last fucking detail to a U.S.

198
00:18:15,099 --> 00:18:15,459
[SPEAKER_05]: audience,

199
00:18:16,201 --> 00:18:16,341
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

200
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:35,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Steak and Shake.

201
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,661
[SPEAKER_21]: Only in the South, which you have a place called Steak and Shake.

202
00:18:38,961 --> 00:18:40,902
[SPEAKER_05]: It's these thick hamburgers, really good.

203
00:18:41,202 --> 00:18:42,742
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a little diner type place.

204
00:18:43,142 --> 00:18:45,703
[SPEAKER_05]: But you can get these humongous milkshakes and they make a half and half.

205
00:18:46,563 --> 00:18:47,844
[SPEAKER_05]: It's literally split down the middle.

206
00:18:47,904 --> 00:18:50,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Half one side is one flavor, half the other is the other.

207
00:18:50,645 --> 00:18:52,625
[SPEAKER_05]: So I actually mixed it up and had banana eggnog.

208
00:18:54,406 --> 00:18:54,746
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh.

209
00:18:55,586 --> 00:18:56,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh God, it was good.

210
00:18:56,907 --> 00:18:58,247
[SPEAKER_07]: That was orgasm in the glass.

211
00:19:00,905 --> 00:19:04,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway... No, it didn't taste like tuna.

212
00:19:04,589 --> 00:19:05,870
[SPEAKER_05]: It tasted like banana and eggnog.

213
00:19:06,671 --> 00:19:06,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn it.

214
00:19:07,992 --> 00:19:08,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, um...

215
00:19:10,342 --> 00:19:12,563
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to meet lots of good people.

216
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:13,904
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a really good time.

217
00:19:16,205 --> 00:19:20,027
[SPEAKER_05]: Monday, my brother was being an ass the whole time.

218
00:19:20,408 --> 00:19:24,430
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not too proud of my brother Matthew.

219
00:19:25,711 --> 00:19:27,291
[SPEAKER_05]: I talked to my brother Phillip while I was there.

220
00:19:27,972 --> 00:19:31,294
[SPEAKER_05]: He's supposed to be down for Christmas, I think.

221
00:19:35,573 --> 00:19:37,537
[SPEAKER_05]: and he's getting married.

222
00:19:38,318 --> 00:19:39,239
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, he's already married.

223
00:19:39,881 --> 00:19:48,395
[SPEAKER_05]: This is my brother who's a Marine and his wife's a Marine and they're actually going to Texas to have a humongous big Mexican wedding.

224
00:19:49,844 --> 00:19:50,464
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to go.

225
00:19:50,484 --> 00:19:51,345
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

226
00:19:51,365 --> 00:19:52,605
[SPEAKER_05]: Because this is going to be a big party.

227
00:19:53,685 --> 00:19:55,146
[SPEAKER_21]: Will there be margaritas involved?

228
00:19:55,866 --> 00:19:56,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Likely.

229
00:19:56,386 --> 00:19:58,687
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

230
00:19:58,787 --> 00:20:01,828
[SPEAKER_21]: Actually, people that know me pretty well know that I'm actually not a big tequila fan.

231
00:20:02,088 --> 00:20:06,150
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll drink margaritas because you can barely taste the tequila, but I cannot stand straight up tequila.

232
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:09,851
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you had that cheap shit here.

233
00:20:11,165 --> 00:20:12,186
[SPEAKER_21]: But I still don't like tequila.

234
00:20:12,206 --> 00:20:13,106
[SPEAKER_21]: You can give me Cuervo.

235
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:13,506
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't care.

236
00:20:13,526 --> 00:20:14,066
[SPEAKER_21]: I still don't like it.

237
00:20:14,106 --> 00:20:15,567
[SPEAKER_05]: I can do shots of tequila.

238
00:20:15,687 --> 00:20:16,807
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's nasty.

239
00:20:17,408 --> 00:20:19,849
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the Blue Agave tequila.

240
00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:24,811
[SPEAKER_05]: The stuff that Anita had way back at the Nasty House.

241
00:20:29,192 --> 00:20:30,973
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was pretty good.

242
00:20:31,853 --> 00:20:35,035
[SPEAKER_05]: I went back to New Orleans on Tuesday.

243
00:20:35,855 --> 00:20:36,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Hung out with my mommy.

244
00:20:37,015 --> 00:20:37,876
[SPEAKER_05]: I fussed at my mom.

245
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:38,296
[SPEAKER_05]: It was fun.

246
00:20:40,097 --> 00:21:09,465
[SPEAKER_21]: and then Jamie Fuss had the most long boring flight back and like the last leg of my I hung out at the Dallas airport for nearly two hours airports aren't so bad now though they have wifi there yeah they got wifi I was just chilling on my laptop and not just that but you know just everything there is to do they're practically shopping malls as well although I would never buy anything there but it's fun to look you know airports aren't that bad anymore well some of them are yeah

247
00:21:09,787 --> 00:21:11,928
[SPEAKER_05]: But I was having a pretty good time, I mean.

248
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:13,088
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I got on a plane.

249
00:21:13,408 --> 00:21:16,590
[SPEAKER_05]: I read the entirety of Ramsey's The Damned on the plane.

250
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:23,132
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, I have to say, safely the best Anne Rice book, because all the rest of her stuff since, it's kind of crap.

251
00:21:23,172 --> 00:21:23,852
[SPEAKER_21]: It's been gay porn.

252
00:21:24,973 --> 00:21:26,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but it's also been crappy.

253
00:21:28,014 --> 00:21:28,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Really crappy.

254
00:21:29,995 --> 00:21:31,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Woman needs to get her groove back.

255
00:21:32,876 --> 00:21:33,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Not rest on her name.

256
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,020
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

257
00:21:49,557 --> 00:21:51,878
[SPEAKER_21]: You talking about that Babani party makes me nostalgic.

258
00:21:51,898 --> 00:21:53,279
[SPEAKER_21]: Remember when we used to do that stuff?

259
00:21:54,459 --> 00:21:57,140
[SPEAKER_21]: At the old studio, which was a really great house for having parties.

260
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,321
[SPEAKER_21]: We'd have the Babani parties.

261
00:21:58,581 --> 00:21:59,762
[SPEAKER_21]: We need to do that shit again.

262
00:21:59,942 --> 00:22:00,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we do.

263
00:22:01,182 --> 00:22:03,563
[SPEAKER_21]: Actually, we kind of had a Babani party last night.

264
00:22:03,663 --> 00:22:08,446
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, it wasn't like a hardcore Babani party, but I'm sure we'll get to that as we go on through How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day.

265
00:22:08,466 --> 00:22:10,807
[SPEAKER_05]: You remember the stuff I would bring with me?

266
00:22:10,987 --> 00:22:11,327
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, yeah.

267
00:22:11,347 --> 00:22:13,428
[SPEAKER_05]: People would say Babani party, and I'm like, oh, shit.

268
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:18,463
[SPEAKER_21]: You bring, like, your old... I remember you brought your Dreamcast pads to one party.

269
00:22:18,743 --> 00:22:19,223
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I did.

270
00:22:19,264 --> 00:22:19,944
[SPEAKER_21]: That was insane.

271
00:22:20,825 --> 00:22:26,909
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, okay, this is what DDR was like in the old days, before we had this vivid nonsense.

272
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:36,336
[SPEAKER_21]: I remember when one of our old guests used to be on the show a bit, Zombie Magus, when he put on his girlfriend's top and was playing Power, Power, Paradise.

273
00:22:36,656 --> 00:22:36,916
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

274
00:22:36,976 --> 00:22:39,558
[SPEAKER_21]: And the picture made some rounds on the internet after that.

275
00:22:40,138 --> 00:22:40,679
[SPEAKER_21]: And, uh...

276
00:22:41,721 --> 00:22:47,506
[SPEAKER_21]: I remember Loki would haul his computer and his Delight Delight reduplication and his pads he'd made for it.

277
00:22:49,287 --> 00:22:49,928
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm nostalgic.

278
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:54,672
[SPEAKER_05]: I would carry around the Drum Mania, Keyboard Mania, 2DX Controller, the bunch of games.

279
00:22:55,212 --> 00:22:57,334
[SPEAKER_05]: All the old Beat Manias, my ASCII pad.

280
00:22:59,332 --> 00:23:10,676
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you think that when this DDR thing is dead, which could happen any day now, do you think these Bomani parties are still going to be going on?

281
00:23:10,776 --> 00:23:11,977
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we'll just go back to porn.

282
00:23:12,017 --> 00:23:16,618
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll just have to go back to the orgies, you're right.

283
00:23:17,099 --> 00:23:18,159
[SPEAKER_21]: How silly of me to ask.

284
00:23:21,141 --> 00:23:24,643
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we'd have to get that copy of Ally McFeel again.

285
00:23:25,884 --> 00:23:26,584
[SPEAKER_06]: That was funny.

286
00:23:26,764 --> 00:23:29,045
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyway, anything else you want to share about your week and your day?

287
00:23:29,065 --> 00:23:30,766
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, no.

288
00:23:30,987 --> 00:23:31,727
[SPEAKER_19]: Moving right along.

289
00:23:31,847 --> 00:23:32,147
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright.

290
00:23:34,929 --> 00:23:38,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, it had a cameo by Ron Jeremy.

291
00:23:42,052 --> 00:23:56,676
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, I was looking up, there's a site online that's like these paper dolls online, and I was trying to make a new avatar for myself on my live journal, and I accidentally came across the real doll site.

292
00:23:58,236 --> 00:23:58,837
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh god.

293
00:23:59,317 --> 00:24:00,697
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very, very icky.

294
00:24:01,637 --> 00:24:05,778
[SPEAKER_21]: I have a request for a new DDR Freak avatar, because the gay pimp one you made me is really cool.

295
00:24:05,798 --> 00:24:07,079
[SPEAKER_21]: I have a request for a new one.

296
00:24:07,199 --> 00:24:11,620
[SPEAKER_21]: I want Xander from Drawn Together, just to make Seeger jealous.

297
00:24:12,216 --> 00:24:12,676
[SPEAKER_05]: From what?

298
00:24:12,876 --> 00:24:14,397
[SPEAKER_21]: Drawn Together, that show on Comedy Central.

299
00:24:14,717 --> 00:24:15,157
[SPEAKER_05]: From what?

300
00:24:15,257 --> 00:24:16,658
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, girl, you are so far behind.

301
00:24:17,058 --> 00:24:21,260
[SPEAKER_05]: I do not have anything but basic channels, but local channels.

302
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:21,820
[SPEAKER_21]: You're missing out.

303
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,621
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a funny show.

304
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,161
[SPEAKER_21]: I hardly ever watch TV.

305
00:24:24,241 --> 00:24:25,742
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the TV is retarded.

306
00:24:25,822 --> 00:24:28,803
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't even watch Survivor or The Apprentice or any of that reality bullshit anymore.

307
00:24:29,364 --> 00:24:30,624
[SPEAKER_21]: Drawn Together is the only show I watch.

308
00:24:31,124 --> 00:24:32,265
[SPEAKER_05]: And when did Hell Freeze Over?

309
00:24:32,845 --> 00:24:33,625
[SPEAKER_21]: I know, I know.

310
00:24:35,026 --> 00:24:36,367
[SPEAKER_21]: You want to talk about Hell Freezing Over?

311
00:24:36,407 --> 00:24:39,848
[SPEAKER_21]: I came this close to joining a gym on Friday.

312
00:24:41,049 --> 00:24:41,549
[SPEAKER_05]: For, um...

313
00:24:44,417 --> 00:24:50,863
[SPEAKER_05]: For the people who didn't have that visual, Rob held his fingers the length of, um, never mind.

314
00:24:50,883 --> 00:24:52,864
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we're not going to talk about that.

315
00:24:54,105 --> 00:24:54,385
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut up.

316
00:24:55,386 --> 00:24:57,088
[SPEAKER_05]: No, because we don't bring up old drama.

317
00:24:58,969 --> 00:24:59,250
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

318
00:25:01,091 --> 00:25:01,452
[SPEAKER_19]: What?

319
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:03,974
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, yeah.

320
00:25:06,711 --> 00:25:09,034
[SPEAKER_05]: It says that when you said Xander, I started thinking of Buffy.

321
00:25:09,194 --> 00:25:14,981
[SPEAKER_21]: I need to respond to some stuff in the chatroom going on right now.

322
00:25:15,061 --> 00:25:19,946
[SPEAKER_21]: First off, Sigurd's telling me he hates me because of the Xander thing, and he says his is better.

323
00:25:19,966 --> 00:25:20,306
[SPEAKER_21]: Whatever.

324
00:25:21,167 --> 00:25:23,550
[SPEAKER_21]: And somebody else, where was it?

325
00:25:23,971 --> 00:25:26,133
[SPEAKER_21]: A couple people commented, DDR's not gonna die.

326
00:25:27,494 --> 00:25:27,755
[SPEAKER_21]: Well...

327
00:25:29,816 --> 00:25:31,177
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm only being half serious.

328
00:25:31,217 --> 00:25:37,940
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't think the death of DDR is anytime soon, especially when we just got Ultramix 2 and the home versions are looking very promising for the future.

329
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:43,803
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't think DDR is seriously going to die, but I think it's a little more cultish, maybe.

330
00:25:43,903 --> 00:25:44,203
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know.

331
00:25:44,223 --> 00:25:44,543
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll see.

332
00:25:44,743 --> 00:25:45,863
[SPEAKER_05]: I also have an announcement.

333
00:25:46,084 --> 00:25:46,324
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

334
00:25:47,564 --> 00:25:49,645
[SPEAKER_05]: I no longer am on the Atkins crap.

335
00:25:50,106 --> 00:25:50,766
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, not crap.

336
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:51,886
[SPEAKER_05]: It's good for a lot of people.

337
00:25:52,327 --> 00:25:53,207
[SPEAKER_05]: It was not good for me.

338
00:25:54,227 --> 00:25:55,708
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can have sushi again.

339
00:25:56,449 --> 00:25:57,169
[SPEAKER_19]: Congratulations.

340
00:25:57,998 --> 00:25:59,079
[SPEAKER_05]: Sushi is wonderful.

341
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:03,522
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and, and, and, and, and, and.

342
00:26:04,743 --> 00:26:05,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing else.

343
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:05,944
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

344
00:26:06,904 --> 00:26:07,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Rob.

345
00:26:07,425 --> 00:26:08,165
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, yes.

346
00:26:08,245 --> 00:26:11,908
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.

347
00:26:12,589 --> 00:26:12,829
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi.

348
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:14,610
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm back!

349
00:26:16,611 --> 00:26:16,992
[SPEAKER_19]: Damn.

350
00:26:17,292 --> 00:26:18,493
[SPEAKER_19]: Angel, how was your week?

351
00:26:18,533 --> 00:26:19,193
[SPEAKER_21]: How was your day?

352
00:26:19,213 --> 00:26:21,935
[SPEAKER_05]: Angel, how was your week?

353
00:26:22,556 --> 00:26:23,196
[SPEAKER_21]: How was your day?

354
00:26:24,257 --> 00:26:26,679
[SPEAKER_04]: School was... School and...

355
00:26:29,256 --> 00:26:29,816
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, nothing.

356
00:26:29,856 --> 00:26:30,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Saturday was nice.

357
00:26:32,318 --> 00:26:40,061
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to waste the week away until Saturday came, because, uh, well, I had a birthday.

358
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:40,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on, everybody.

359
00:26:41,042 --> 00:26:41,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.

360
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:43,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.

361
00:26:43,963 --> 00:26:44,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.

362
00:26:45,484 --> 00:26:45,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Not.

363
00:26:47,365 --> 00:26:49,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually hanging out with everyone was great.

364
00:26:49,726 --> 00:26:57,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and we had played lots of Bomani, uh, 8th style,

365
00:26:58,622 --> 00:26:59,903
[SPEAKER_04]: and Poppin10.

366
00:27:00,703 --> 00:27:02,924
[SPEAKER_04]: So I got to see those for the first time, that was pretty cool.

367
00:27:04,464 --> 00:27:12,407
[SPEAKER_04]: And the best thing of all was obviously hanging around with the people that I don't usually get to hang around with, so that was good.

368
00:27:14,267 --> 00:27:16,908
[SPEAKER_04]: And just enjoying my birthday weekend so far, I guess.

369
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:23,831
[SPEAKER_20]: And now, Bradley, how was your week, how was your day?

370
00:27:25,771 --> 00:27:27,752
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, uh, this week was

371
00:27:29,216 --> 00:27:29,837
[SPEAKER_18]: Work, of course.

372
00:27:31,058 --> 00:27:32,659
[SPEAKER_18]: And an interesting thing happened at work.

373
00:27:32,719 --> 00:27:36,942
[SPEAKER_18]: There was a person, my kind of work is, it's sort of a training.

374
00:27:37,263 --> 00:27:39,064
[SPEAKER_18]: They train people to do stuff, so.

375
00:27:39,084 --> 00:27:46,250
[SPEAKER_18]: One of the students came back, so he had some questions for, because he was going to do a test, a state test for his line of work he wanted to get into.

376
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:58,119
[SPEAKER_18]: And he came back, asked some questions, and he and the instructor had a nice, somehow a disagreement, or something about the instructor doesn't like this guy, so

377
00:27:58,717 --> 00:28:02,098
[SPEAKER_18]: He actually misspoken said that he didn't like him.

378
00:28:02,538 --> 00:28:07,079
[SPEAKER_18]: So this causes him to get really angry and start ranting and raving.

379
00:28:07,139 --> 00:28:09,059
[SPEAKER_18]: And then he had to go outside.

380
00:28:09,159 --> 00:28:12,960
[SPEAKER_18]: The manager had to take him outside and talk for like an hour to try to calm him down.

381
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,080
[SPEAKER_18]: And he came back on Friday.

382
00:28:14,961 --> 00:28:20,722
[SPEAKER_18]: And his wife told him to bring along some candy just to give to us or something like that.

383
00:28:21,662 --> 00:28:25,383
[SPEAKER_18]: And he comes back and... Okay, so here's this candy.

384
00:28:25,543 --> 00:28:26,143
[SPEAKER_18]: And then he comes...

385
00:28:26,607 --> 00:28:29,608
[SPEAKER_18]: And then he starts launching this big thing about discrimination.

386
00:28:29,928 --> 00:28:30,948
[SPEAKER_18]: He discriminates against me.

387
00:28:31,248 --> 00:28:32,189
[SPEAKER_18]: He doesn't like me.

388
00:28:33,009 --> 00:28:35,310
[SPEAKER_18]: For some reason, some bullshit like that.

389
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:42,112
[SPEAKER_18]: And so, just me and the receptionist are in the room and he's like, blah, blah, blah.

390
00:28:42,772 --> 00:28:44,512
[SPEAKER_18]: Some kind of weird shit like that.

391
00:28:45,393 --> 00:28:52,875
[SPEAKER_18]: So, good thing the boss came in like a minute later and then started to talk to him so we could sneak out.

392
00:28:53,752 --> 00:28:54,993
[SPEAKER_18]: Were they getting paid for this?

393
00:28:55,013 --> 00:28:55,173
[SPEAKER_18]: To talk?

394
00:29:17,817 --> 00:29:21,259
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, it's a business, so it's part of the work.

395
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:28,204
[SPEAKER_21]: I always found that humorous when, you know, there's big fights going on and we have to sit down and have a discussion, but we're all getting paid for it type thing.

396
00:29:28,564 --> 00:29:31,245
[SPEAKER_21]: We just wasted three hours of productivity to talk out.

397
00:29:31,706 --> 00:29:34,928
[SPEAKER_21]: Not that I ever get into disagreements with people, but, you know, I've had to sit in on them.

398
00:29:34,948 --> 00:29:35,768
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I didn't have anything to do with it.

399
00:29:35,808 --> 00:29:38,150
[SPEAKER_18]: I just went and sat in the hall because I didn't want to get involved.

400
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:39,350
[SPEAKER_21]: And you got paid for it, too.

401
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:43,953
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, so it was a nice one hour, like an hour break just to not do anything.

402
00:29:44,414 --> 00:29:46,655
[SPEAKER_18]: Just wait until it cooled down.

403
00:29:47,781 --> 00:29:51,643
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, okay, and on Monday I got Katamari Damashii, and that was a lot of fun.

404
00:29:54,665 --> 00:30:04,610
[SPEAKER_21]: Sorry, every time somebody... It's like how when everybody says friends, you think of NBC, or when somebody says 90210, with Katamari it's... Shut up, Loki.

405
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:06,391
[SPEAKER_21]: No, actually, I think of that.

406
00:30:06,411 --> 00:30:07,551
[SPEAKER_21]: I think of that song, too.

407
00:30:17,239 --> 00:30:19,280
[SPEAKER_18]: and played that most every day this week.

408
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:23,061
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, I did play this every day this week, except for today, because I got up.

409
00:30:23,361 --> 00:30:36,105
[SPEAKER_18]: Because last night was the party for Angel and Anita, or DD Archipelagic, for their birthdays, and that was a lot of fun, because Navi brought over 8-style and poppin' music.

410
00:30:36,145 --> 00:30:38,306
[SPEAKER_21]: God bless the town's poppin' music whore.

411
00:30:38,326 --> 00:30:41,727
[SPEAKER_18]: I got to play on those arcade-style controllers.

412
00:30:43,228 --> 00:30:43,708
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, and...

413
00:30:46,517 --> 00:30:47,177
[SPEAKER_18]: and that was fun.

414
00:30:47,237 --> 00:30:57,840
[SPEAKER_18]: Of course I didn't do all that great on 8th style because basically you had it up on a stand and then the TV was down like two or three feet, several feet away.

415
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:01,321
[SPEAKER_18]: Of course I hadn't played on an arcade style controller in a long time.

416
00:31:02,202 --> 00:31:08,264
[SPEAKER_18]: And of course there was the, I just played the hard news songs like, oh god, what the hell is it called?

417
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:09,244
[SPEAKER_21]: Nebula Grasper?

418
00:31:09,624 --> 00:31:13,285
[SPEAKER_18]: Nebula Grasper is a fucking impossible game.

419
00:31:14,192 --> 00:31:16,874
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, at least for a first try, it's like, fuck, what the hell?

420
00:31:17,254 --> 00:31:18,035
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, all over the place.

421
00:31:19,476 --> 00:31:33,647
[SPEAKER_21]: And I always love non-Bamani peoples, like the people who don't really play 2DX, DDR and stuff, I always love their reaction to stuff like that, because there were a few people at the party last night who don't really play DDR, 2DX, and they were just kind of watching Navi playing, and just, like, he was just crazy.

422
00:31:33,667 --> 00:31:39,391
[SPEAKER_21]: He was playing, like, Nebio Grasper another or something, and just everybody was just kind of like, that's crazy.

423
00:31:40,872 --> 00:31:41,833
[SPEAKER_01]: That is so crazy.

424
00:31:45,376 --> 00:31:47,616
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Loki, how was your week, how was your day?

425
00:32:14,673 --> 00:32:27,118
[SPEAKER_20]: Today did not start out too good due to certain events that have taken place outside of our apartment complex in the street.

426
00:32:28,058 --> 00:32:28,739
[SPEAKER_20]: It was not fun.

427
00:32:28,859 --> 00:32:30,159
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, we'll get into that later, I'm sure.

428
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:35,521
[SPEAKER_20]: And then yesterday, it was okay.

429
00:32:36,002 --> 00:32:36,622
[SPEAKER_20]: Went and...

430
00:32:37,771 --> 00:32:38,732
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

431
00:32:58,615 --> 00:33:06,098
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know, most of the week I've been just playing Final Fantasy XI, leveling my summoner to 20, which I just finished right before the show.

432
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:10,420
[SPEAKER_20]: And, um... What else have I been doing?

433
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:17,463
[SPEAKER_20]: I've played a little bit of Grand Theft Auto, finally passed this mission that I couldn't beat for a while, and now I have to run errands for some pimp.

434
00:33:18,443 --> 00:33:23,025
[SPEAKER_20]: And, um... Went and saw Closer, I'll get into that later.

435
00:33:24,166 --> 00:33:27,647
[SPEAKER_20]: And, um... Eh, that's about all.

436
00:33:28,769 --> 00:33:32,412
[SPEAKER_20]: It's been like kind of a week just crashing into the ground.

437
00:33:33,733 --> 00:33:35,134
[SPEAKER_21]: That sucks about your grandma, I'm sorry to hear it.

438
00:33:36,615 --> 00:33:36,916
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

439
00:33:37,596 --> 00:33:39,498
[SPEAKER_21]: Have you used your machine to try and contact her yet?

440
00:33:40,899 --> 00:33:42,320
[SPEAKER_20]: No, I have not, you asshole.

441
00:33:45,463 --> 00:33:45,803
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway.

442
00:33:45,823 --> 00:33:48,885
[SPEAKER_21]: Did you ever open your portal to hell?

443
00:33:49,806 --> 00:33:52,929
[SPEAKER_21]: I was gonna say, you went on a ghostbusting trip yesterday, didn't you?

444
00:33:53,389 --> 00:33:53,870
[SPEAKER_20]: Hunting.

445
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:55,571
[SPEAKER_20]: Ghost hunting, not busting.

446
00:33:56,337 --> 00:34:25,699
[SPEAKER_20]: We just, we went, walked around Knights Ferry, which is basically this old abandoned, it's not really an abandoned mining town, it's just an old, um, mining town, it's got like a bunch of dilapidated, it's not really a mining town, I guess, they have an old, um, mill there that's kind of been, um, it's just the ruins of it, so we just walked around there, and they also have a very long, um, they have a 150 meter, uh, covered bridge, which is pretty neat, and we walked down that, and we went to their, um,

447
00:34:26,653 --> 00:34:51,052
[SPEAKER_20]: Graveyard that was there and walked around that for a little bit but you know I mean these are just for it's just kind of just to get out of the house because we you know we're looking for like an actual place that my my example was something that's more trauma there than you know old you know because necessarily just visiting any old place is not going to work you need to have something where oh yeah 50 people murdered there you know that kind of thing

448
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:55,771
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, just something, you know, traumatic, like, uh, Insane Asylum or something like that.

449
00:34:56,151 --> 00:34:59,131
[SPEAKER_20]: But, you know, no luck with any of that stuff around here, so.

450
00:34:59,851 --> 00:35:00,072
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, well.

451
00:35:02,232 --> 00:35:02,592
[SPEAKER_20]: So, yeah.

452
00:35:02,972 --> 00:35:03,792
[SPEAKER_20]: That's what I've been doing.

453
00:35:04,172 --> 00:35:05,632
[SPEAKER_18]: Isn't this place the Insane Asylum?

454
00:35:06,773 --> 00:35:07,313
[SPEAKER_20]: Not yet.

455
00:35:07,493 --> 00:35:09,113
[SPEAKER_20]: I have to haunt this place first.

456
00:35:09,293 --> 00:35:10,873
[SPEAKER_20]: I haven't quite gotten around to that yet.

457
00:35:12,014 --> 00:35:14,914
[SPEAKER_20]: Soon enough, you know, I've been, like, I have my priorities.

458
00:35:14,934 --> 00:35:17,535
[SPEAKER_20]: Like, I was gonna work on the cabinet today, and then I just got tired.

459
00:35:18,295 --> 00:35:19,415
[SPEAKER_20]: Those fuckers this morning.

460
00:35:19,435 --> 00:35:19,515
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

461
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:25,172
[SPEAKER_21]: And by tired he means looking for a party in Final Fantasy XI so he can get his summoner to level 20.

462
00:35:25,772 --> 00:35:26,072
[SPEAKER_20]: Addict!

463
00:35:27,013 --> 00:35:30,494
[SPEAKER_20]: No, I was tired from other things, but yes, I just got bored of that too.

464
00:35:30,634 --> 00:35:39,718
[SPEAKER_20]: But the other things in the morning made me tired because I'm exhausted right now from having to wake up early yesterday and having to wake up early today.

465
00:35:42,708 --> 00:35:43,949
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, my turn, my week and my day.

466
00:35:44,249 --> 00:35:48,671
[SPEAKER_21]: I got to play 8th Style and Pop Music 10 twice this week, actually, because I hung out with Navi on Monday.

467
00:35:48,931 --> 00:35:52,473
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll talk about those games a little bit later, because, you know, I want to talk about my money stuff a little bit.

468
00:35:53,193 --> 00:36:00,677
[SPEAKER_21]: But Navi and I, after playing some of that, we got to go to the mall, and I was going to help him do some Christmas shopping over at Arden Fair, which is a big mall in Sacramento.

469
00:36:00,697 --> 00:36:01,198
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a huge mall.

470
00:36:02,438 --> 00:36:04,259
[SPEAKER_21]: And so we ended up walking out of there.

471
00:36:04,299 --> 00:36:05,480
[SPEAKER_21]: He didn't end up buying anything.

472
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,161
[SPEAKER_21]: He just kind of looked around at some different places.

473
00:36:07,641 --> 00:36:10,802
[SPEAKER_21]: And I fucking bought an iPod at the Apple store.

474
00:36:11,823 --> 00:36:13,624
[SPEAKER_21]: Because I wanted one, really.

475
00:36:14,624 --> 00:36:16,044
[SPEAKER_19]: I wanted one really badly.

476
00:36:16,124 --> 00:36:17,665
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm still two away from my free win.

477
00:36:18,265 --> 00:36:20,585
[SPEAKER_20]: Why not just buy a fucking iMac, you know?

478
00:36:21,126 --> 00:36:22,186
[SPEAKER_20]: Just join the cult.

479
00:36:22,366 --> 00:36:23,686
[SPEAKER_21]: I've thought about it, actually.

480
00:36:24,847 --> 00:36:27,888
[SPEAKER_20]: Good, it's a big flaming piece of shit that doesn't do anything.

481
00:36:28,668 --> 00:36:29,668
[SPEAKER_21]: You make Apple users cry.

482
00:36:29,708 --> 00:36:30,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless you're into graphics.

483
00:36:31,949 --> 00:36:34,589
[SPEAKER_21]: Or media, which, you know, this show happens to be.

484
00:36:34,629 --> 00:36:36,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Because all the pros are on Macs.

485
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:38,611
[SPEAKER_21]: Maybe we wouldn't have the freaking buzz on a Mac.

486
00:36:39,431 --> 00:36:39,751
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway.

487
00:36:45,958 --> 00:36:54,220
[SPEAKER_21]: I just wanted an iPod actually because the stereo in my car broke a while back.

488
00:36:54,360 --> 00:37:00,481
[SPEAKER_21]: Actually, it was Sigurd's Echo Image CD that broke my CD player in the car, actually, because it ate it and wouldn't give it back one day.

489
00:37:01,561 --> 00:37:03,942
[SPEAKER_21]: Once it heard Echo Image, it could hear no other music.

490
00:37:04,902 --> 00:37:07,143
[SPEAKER_21]: Basically is how it all boiled down.

491
00:37:07,163 --> 00:37:07,763
[SPEAKER_21]: So...

492
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:13,793
[SPEAKER_21]: It won't eject CDs anymore, and now I won't even play the CD that's in there.

493
00:37:13,873 --> 00:37:18,276
[SPEAKER_21]: So, luckily though, it has an auxiliary port in it, so I can plug anything I want in there.

494
00:37:18,296 --> 00:37:21,778
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm just like, fuck it, I'm gonna get an iPod, and I'll just use that as my car stereo.

495
00:37:22,078 --> 00:37:32,725
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's worked out really well, except for the fact that if you think I'm bad when I'm talking on my cell phone and trying to drive, you should see me when I'm trying to find the song on my iPod I want to hear and drive at the same time.

496
00:37:34,406 --> 00:37:34,927
[SPEAKER_21]: It's beautiful.

497
00:37:36,514 --> 00:37:37,095
[SPEAKER_21]: And you know what?

498
00:37:37,115 --> 00:37:47,942
[SPEAKER_21]: They can pass all the laws they want to say I can't talk on my cell phone and drive, but I don't see them making any law anytime soon that says I can't play on my iPod and try to drive at the same time, so look out.

499
00:37:48,022 --> 00:37:52,345
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe the law is operation of electronical devices while driving, so your iPod's included.

500
00:37:52,385 --> 00:37:53,046
[SPEAKER_05]: God damn it!

501
00:37:58,149 --> 00:38:02,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Extraneous, like CD, well, like laptops.

502
00:38:03,333 --> 00:38:04,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Peripheral devices.

503
00:38:07,177 --> 00:38:17,126
[SPEAKER_21]: Secret in our chatroom right now over at Orangelandradio.com, he says that that day where his Echo Image CD got eaten by my car stereo player, he said that that day kind of pissed him off.

504
00:38:17,486 --> 00:38:22,430
[SPEAKER_21]: Except for the Classic Gaming Expo and the little girl that was hitting all the buttons on the restrooms that she rocked.

505
00:38:22,791 --> 00:38:27,735
[SPEAKER_21]: And that reminds me, I actually found the picture of Jamie doing that at Classic Gaming Expo.

506
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:29,195
[SPEAKER_05]: I had my heads in the air.

507
00:38:29,415 --> 00:38:30,636
[SPEAKER_21]: What was it?

508
00:38:30,676 --> 00:38:32,356
[SPEAKER_21]: We paid you $10 to do it?

509
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:32,717
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

510
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:35,137
[SPEAKER_05]: And I spent it on Pac-Land for the TurboGrafx.

511
00:38:35,157 --> 00:38:38,559
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, we bought some game for you, basically, for you to imitate a little girl.

512
00:38:38,619 --> 00:38:39,439
[SPEAKER_21]: I found the picture.

513
00:38:39,459 --> 00:38:40,499
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to send it to Sigurd.

514
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:45,621
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, we're going to Classic Gaming Expo again this year.

515
00:38:46,488 --> 00:38:48,451
[SPEAKER_21]: It's in Burlingame.

516
00:38:48,471 --> 00:38:54,039
[SPEAKER_05]: The only reason that last year's was in was because they had that thing a few days before.

517
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,303
[SPEAKER_05]: But Classic Gaming Expo this year is going to be in Burlingame.

518
00:38:57,344 --> 00:38:59,326
[SPEAKER_05]: That means trips to network video.

519
00:39:00,989 --> 00:39:02,531
[SPEAKER_05]: And the store that sells the airsoft guns.

520
00:39:05,396 --> 00:39:07,560
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, and I guess that was pretty much my week and my day.

521
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:16,094
[SPEAKER_21]: I spent a lot of time playing Final Fantasy XI as well, because basically I got stood up Friday night, so I decided to wither away my sorrows inside a nice game of Final Fantasy XI, so...

522
00:39:17,193 --> 00:39:26,276
[SPEAKER_21]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

523
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:42,941
[SPEAKER_21]: The freaking game took us three hours to play.

524
00:39:43,341 --> 00:39:45,542
[SPEAKER_21]: The last time I played Cranium it only took two.

525
00:39:45,882 --> 00:39:47,703
[SPEAKER_21]: Turbo Cranium ended up taking longer.

526
00:39:47,923 --> 00:39:49,043
[SPEAKER_21]: What in the hell is up with that?

527
00:39:49,123 --> 00:39:51,204
[SPEAKER_21]: And no, it's not because we kept taking breaks.

528
00:39:51,344 --> 00:39:52,905
[SPEAKER_21]: It just was a long-ass game.

529
00:39:52,925 --> 00:39:53,585
[SPEAKER_21]: It was no shorter.

530
00:39:54,325 --> 00:39:58,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody's gonna get this joke but you, Rob, but you can be my puppet master anytime.

531
00:39:59,554 --> 00:40:00,054
[SPEAKER_21]: How foul.

532
00:40:02,595 --> 00:40:06,316
[SPEAKER_21]: But how long did the... I ended up having to leave around midnight because I was kind of afraid.

533
00:40:06,496 --> 00:40:10,878
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, A, I was tired, and B, I was afraid I wasn't going to be able to park when I got back here if I waited any longer.

534
00:40:10,938 --> 00:40:12,098
[SPEAKER_21]: But how was the rest of the night?

535
00:40:12,938 --> 00:40:13,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

536
00:40:13,178 --> 00:40:18,760
[SPEAKER_04]: We ended up playing Hear Me Out for, well, the majority of the night.

537
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:23,382
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we played Poppin' 10 also, but yeah, that other game was kind of weird.

538
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:28,593
[SPEAKER_21]: Also, DDArcoholic made sushi from scratch.

539
00:40:28,613 --> 00:40:31,736
[SPEAKER_21]: It was really good, but it was kind of interesting because she used wieners in it.

540
00:40:31,856 --> 00:40:33,918
[SPEAKER_21]: Like, she used hot dogs instead of fish.

541
00:40:33,938 --> 00:40:35,160
[SPEAKER_21]: She put, like, hot dogs in there.

542
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,501
[SPEAKER_21]: But it was actually really good.

543
00:40:36,521 --> 00:40:37,222
[SPEAKER_21]: It was kind of weird.

544
00:40:37,883 --> 00:40:38,824
[SPEAKER_21]: I just thought it was neat.

545
00:40:39,124 --> 00:40:40,105
[SPEAKER_21]: It was very resourceful.

546
00:40:40,125 --> 00:40:40,605
[SPEAKER_21]: It was a good idea.

547
00:40:41,706 --> 00:40:44,587
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway, we're going to take a break.

548
00:40:44,607 --> 00:40:47,288
[SPEAKER_21]: When we come back from this break, we're going to talk a little bit more about 2DX8 style.

549
00:40:47,348 --> 00:40:49,088
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to talk a little more about Pop Music 10.

550
00:40:49,789 --> 00:40:53,470
[SPEAKER_21]: I want to play the new remix of I Feel for you guys.

551
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:58,811
[SPEAKER_21]: We played it on Thursday night, but I know nobody listens to Outside the Box on Thursday night, but more of you guys listened tonight.

552
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:02,912
[SPEAKER_21]: So we're going to play the new I Feel mix from Service Pack.

553
00:41:02,972 --> 00:41:03,853
[SPEAKER_21]: I keep calling it Service Pack.

554
00:41:03,893 --> 00:41:07,194
[SPEAKER_21]: Song Pack 7 from Ultramix 2 because a lot of people don't want to hear that.

555
00:41:07,234 --> 00:41:08,074
[SPEAKER_21]: So we're going to play that for you guys.

556
00:41:08,374 --> 00:41:10,117
[SPEAKER_21]: and plenty more when we come back from this break.

557
00:41:10,177 --> 00:41:13,141
[SPEAKER_21]: In this break, though, some music from DDR Festival.

558
00:41:13,482 --> 00:41:17,367
[SPEAKER_21]: Because we haven't really gotten to hear much music from DDR Festival yet, but we have some songs for you guys.

559
00:41:17,387 --> 00:41:22,254
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to hear Superstar, Diamonds, and Cutie Honey on this break.

560
00:41:22,595 --> 00:41:23,236
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll be right back.

561
00:41:36,439 --> 00:41:56,369
[SPEAKER_08]: Slide it on a piece of paper Got a feeling I'll see you later There's something about this, let's keep it moving And if it's good, that's to hear something cooking Is that what you want to wrap it through?

562
00:41:56,929 --> 00:42:00,231
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm feeling some connection to the things you do

563
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:07,088
[SPEAKER_08]: What is it that makes me feel like this?

564
00:42:07,288 --> 00:42:24,552
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know who you are, but you must be some kind of superstar Cause you got all I need, no matter where you are You just wanna make me feel like this What is it that makes me feel like this?

565
00:42:24,633 --> 00:42:26,313
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know who you are

572
00:45:53,533 --> 00:45:57,114
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Random Person on the Street, who by the way is not an actor,

573
00:46:20,683 --> 00:46:23,365
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think of the Orange Lounge B-Money Music & More show?

574
00:46:23,646 --> 00:46:30,792
[SPEAKER_12]: The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.

575
00:46:31,133 --> 00:46:33,154
[SPEAKER_12]: It's unearthly.

576
00:46:33,355 --> 00:46:37,098
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like being at a club, except you don't have to actually ask someone to dance.

577
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:39,200
[SPEAKER_21]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

578
00:46:39,741 --> 00:46:54,071
[SPEAKER_21]: Festival has some strange music in it, it's honestly, I didn't bother to buy Festival, I just, I didn't think there was enough in it for me, because I had Extreme, and I have an Xbox, so, and I had Ultramix One, which is where a lot of songs came from, but Festival certainly has some quirky little songs in it, doesn't it?

579
00:46:54,931 --> 00:46:56,292
[SPEAKER_21]: Interesting, that's all I have to say.

580
00:46:56,732 --> 00:47:02,036
[SPEAKER_21]: Although I love Superstar, I, it's almost worth buying the mix for that, but not really, because that's like 80 bucks.

581
00:47:02,336 --> 00:47:04,157
[SPEAKER_20]: Also, it has different steps.

582
00:47:04,397 --> 00:47:09,018
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, it does have different steps for a lot of the songs that were on Ultramix 1, but I don't know.

583
00:47:10,279 --> 00:47:19,722
[SPEAKER_21]: Honestly, with Ultramix 2 now and the fact that you can make your own edits, I have a feeling that any day now we're going to start seeing those steps get uploaded to Xbox Live, so I'm not really too concerned about it.

584
00:47:20,462 --> 00:47:23,583
[SPEAKER_21]: It's just somebody has to take the effort, and that person's not going to be me because I'm lazy.

585
00:47:25,524 --> 00:47:25,744
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway.

586
00:47:26,675 --> 00:47:27,716
[SPEAKER_21]: Uh, 2DX8Style.

587
00:47:28,176 --> 00:47:32,399
[SPEAKER_21]: Got a chance to check it out over at, um, Navi, Pop Music Horror.

588
00:47:32,419 --> 00:47:32,799
[SPEAKER_21]: He has it.

589
00:47:32,819 --> 00:47:34,120
[SPEAKER_21]: I got to check it out earlier this week.

590
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,241
[SPEAKER_21]: And man do I suck at 2DX now.

591
00:47:36,341 --> 00:47:36,921
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, seriously.

592
00:47:36,941 --> 00:47:37,742
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, me too.

593
00:47:37,842 --> 00:47:40,383
[SPEAKER_21]: I haven't played 2DX seriously in quite a while.

594
00:47:40,484 --> 00:47:41,804
[SPEAKER_21]: I didn't really get into 7th style.

595
00:47:41,844 --> 00:47:42,685
[SPEAKER_21]: I played it one time.

596
00:47:43,465 --> 00:47:52,711
[SPEAKER_21]: A lot of this has to do with the fact that my controller is broken, and I'd rather buy myself a lot of other useless crap, like iPods and, uh, things like that, than buy...

597
00:47:53,431 --> 00:47:54,393
[SPEAKER_21]: A new 2DX controller.

598
00:47:54,853 --> 00:47:57,697
[SPEAKER_21]: And I seriously think that's the reason that I haven't been playing a whole lot of 2DX.

599
00:47:58,017 --> 00:48:00,500
[SPEAKER_21]: But 8th style is pretty sweet, I gotta say.

600
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:01,922
[SPEAKER_21]: It has a lot of great new songs in it.

601
00:48:02,903 --> 00:48:04,365
[SPEAKER_21]: Those of you guys that listen to the show regularly...

602
00:48:04,824 --> 00:48:06,545
[SPEAKER_21]: You already know how I feel about Everyday Lovely Day.

603
00:48:06,585 --> 00:48:07,226
[SPEAKER_21]: Like, I love that song.

604
00:48:07,566 --> 00:48:09,607
[SPEAKER_21]: And then, of course, it has a bunch of 2DX Red songs in it.

605
00:48:11,109 --> 00:48:15,532
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, not a bunch, but three, which I consider to be a bunch for, you know, preview, because usually it's only like one or two.

606
00:48:17,553 --> 00:48:20,755
[SPEAKER_21]: And then, some of the new consumer videos are pretty funny.

607
00:48:21,556 --> 00:48:22,777
[SPEAKER_21]: Like, Step Into The New World.

608
00:48:23,017 --> 00:48:24,458
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't really like that song a whole lot.

609
00:48:24,498 --> 00:48:25,499
[SPEAKER_21]: The song kind of, meh.

610
00:48:25,859 --> 00:48:26,940
[SPEAKER_21]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

611
00:48:43,183 --> 00:48:46,506
[SPEAKER_21]: And then also another video I love is Lovebox.

612
00:48:46,786 --> 00:48:55,353
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know if you guys got to see this video at all, but Lovebox is the one that has, I think it's Meg and one of her cohorts or something, I don't know, an uncredited person.

613
00:48:56,033 --> 00:48:59,616
[SPEAKER_21]: They're dressed up as these like Austin Powers dance chicks, kind of.

614
00:49:00,316 --> 00:49:04,820
[SPEAKER_21]: Like they're all dressed in these like 60s hippie, like things you'd see on Laugh-In.

615
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:05,821
[SPEAKER_21]: You remember that old show Laugh-In?

616
00:49:06,181 --> 00:49:07,342
[SPEAKER_21]: Like when the people would be dancing?

617
00:49:07,982 --> 00:49:13,985
[SPEAKER_21]: It was kind of like that, and they're just driving around the city and singing, and they're wearing, like, glow bracelets and stuff.

618
00:49:14,465 --> 00:49:15,206
[SPEAKER_21]: It's really great.

619
00:49:16,086 --> 00:49:16,566
[SPEAKER_21]: Lovebox.

620
00:49:16,746 --> 00:49:17,827
[SPEAKER_21]: I highly recommend this one.

621
00:49:19,168 --> 00:49:22,529
[SPEAKER_21]: Although the song kind of sucks, but the video's great.

622
00:49:24,930 --> 00:49:27,232
[SPEAKER_21]: So, you guys have gotten to play 8-Style a little bit, too.

623
00:49:27,272 --> 00:49:28,772
[SPEAKER_21]: What do you guys think of 2DX 8-Style?

624
00:49:30,573 --> 00:49:32,234
[SPEAKER_05]: I suck at Let Me Go, Ribera.

625
00:49:33,274 --> 00:49:34,475
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, I remember that song was so great.

626
00:49:34,515 --> 00:49:36,116
[SPEAKER_05]: And the scene kept falling out of my lap.

627
00:49:37,253 --> 00:49:38,193
[SPEAKER_05]: I miss arcades.

628
00:49:38,213 --> 00:49:42,015
[SPEAKER_21]: Look pretty nice.

629
00:50:06,289 --> 00:50:08,750
[SPEAKER_21]: Is this something you think you might have to break down and purchase?

630
00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:09,931
[SPEAKER_18]: I already have purchased it.

631
00:50:10,091 --> 00:50:10,511
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, have you?

632
00:50:10,771 --> 00:50:11,571
[SPEAKER_18]: I just haven't gotten it yet.

633
00:50:12,231 --> 00:50:14,032
[SPEAKER_18]: You probably mentioned it and I forgot.

634
00:50:14,452 --> 00:50:15,953
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I mentioned it like two weeks ago.

635
00:50:15,973 --> 00:50:16,353
[SPEAKER_21]: That's right.

636
00:50:16,673 --> 00:50:17,033
[SPEAKER_21]: I forgot.

637
00:50:20,335 --> 00:50:23,316
[SPEAKER_21]: Any particularly favorite consumer songs that you like in any song?

638
00:50:24,536 --> 00:50:28,478
[SPEAKER_18]: I haven't heard them enough to truly say yet.

639
00:50:30,063 --> 00:50:38,313
[SPEAKER_21]: I played a new 7 star, I think it was Don't Be Afraid Myself, was one of the, like it's the J-pop one, it's got a really, it's actually got a pretty That song was great!

640
00:50:38,533 --> 00:50:41,177
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got a pretty cool video to it Didn't it have the video in the bathroom?

641
00:50:41,697 --> 00:50:42,158
[SPEAKER_05]: In the shower?

642
00:50:42,577 --> 00:50:43,498
[SPEAKER_21]: I think so?

643
00:50:43,518 --> 00:50:45,879
[SPEAKER_05]: It looked like they were dancing in like a locker room shower.

644
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:47,000
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, I think that might have been it.

645
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:49,102
[SPEAKER_21]: I could only kind of half see the video because I tried to play the song.

646
00:50:49,122 --> 00:50:49,602
[SPEAKER_21]: That song was cool.

647
00:50:49,762 --> 00:50:52,784
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, the song is cool, but man, I fucked up that song so bad.

648
00:50:53,005 --> 00:50:57,128
[SPEAKER_21]: Like, it really shows like how out of it on 2DX I am because I can't sight read anymore.

649
00:50:57,448 --> 00:51:01,931
[SPEAKER_21]: Like, I was able to play Attitude and Star Dream and all these songs I used to play all the time on 8th style.

650
00:51:01,971 --> 00:51:03,092
[SPEAKER_21]: I was able to play those just fine.

651
00:51:03,392 --> 00:51:07,655
[SPEAKER_21]: But man, throw something new at me and I just, like, the rhythms and everything didn't make any sense to me.

652
00:51:08,035 --> 00:51:08,696
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so sad.

653
00:51:09,717 --> 00:51:10,917
[SPEAKER_21]: I cry for my 2DX skills.

654
00:51:11,798 --> 00:51:15,360
[SPEAKER_21]: But Dancer, 8Style was worth it just to be able to play Dancer again.

655
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:18,282
[SPEAKER_21]: Although, is it just me or is something kind of weird at the end of the video?

656
00:51:18,382 --> 00:51:20,323
[SPEAKER_21]: Like it freezes kind of at the end of the video.

657
00:51:20,724 --> 00:51:23,005
[SPEAKER_21]: Like I remember it kind of faded out in the arcade.

658
00:51:23,045 --> 00:51:24,386
[SPEAKER_21]: Maybe I'm just crazy, I don't know.

659
00:51:25,166 --> 00:51:30,830
[SPEAKER_21]: But a lot of 8Style machines had broken videos in the first place, so that's probably the first time a lot of people got to actually play 2DX with the videos.

660
00:51:31,150 --> 00:51:32,691
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know, pretty cool.

661
00:51:32,751 --> 00:51:34,252
[SPEAKER_21]: Angel, what were your thoughts on 2DX 8Style?

662
00:51:35,598 --> 00:51:39,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Love is Orange, Attitude, and A. That's all I have to say.

663
00:51:40,306 --> 00:51:46,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, I used to watch you guys play that all the time, and I was always all envious, and I still am, so, yeah.

664
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:53,501
[SPEAKER_21]: A is technically a 7th style song, but it does make a repeat in 8th style.

665
00:51:53,641 --> 00:52:01,562
[SPEAKER_21]: It's interesting, they took some of the most noteworthy 7th style songs, like A and Stoic, and they ended up repeating on 8th style after all.

666
00:52:01,582 --> 00:52:03,583
[SPEAKER_21]: So now I'm kind of like, do I really need to get 7th style?

667
00:52:04,183 --> 00:52:10,284
[SPEAKER_21]: But then I remembered, yes, I want to whore Beauty of Silence in the privacy of my own home, is basically what it boils down to.

668
00:52:10,724 --> 00:52:12,164
[SPEAKER_21]: Just like, remember the old arcade days?

669
00:52:12,344 --> 00:52:14,044
[SPEAKER_21]: Frickin' everybody whored Beauty of Silence.

670
00:52:14,084 --> 00:52:14,845
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, almost everybody.

671
00:52:15,825 --> 00:52:17,025
[SPEAKER_21]: I know I was a big part of that, but...

672
00:52:18,435 --> 00:52:22,694
[SPEAKER_21]: Like, players best would be 5-1-1, because all the noobs would play 5-1-1, and then, like, Beauty is Silenced.

673
00:52:26,198 --> 00:52:30,901
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway, moving on, Poppin' Music 10 was another game I got to check out earlier this week.

674
00:52:31,642 --> 00:52:36,225
[SPEAKER_21]: Pretty cool, I have to admit, I think I kind of like the way 9 is set up a little bit better.

675
00:52:36,325 --> 00:52:48,694
[SPEAKER_21]: I thought the unlock system in 9 was a lot cooler, because 10 has this wacky roulette thing, and Navi had the timing down perfect though, so that he was managing to unlock quite a bit of stuff on the roulette wheel, but it was kind of...

676
00:52:51,316 --> 00:52:57,582
[SPEAKER_21]: I was a little disappointed by that.

677
00:52:58,663 --> 00:53:00,144
[SPEAKER_21]: But the song list was pretty good in 10.

678
00:53:00,185 --> 00:53:01,506
[SPEAKER_21]: There's a lot of great songs I love in 10.

679
00:53:01,546 --> 00:53:04,849
[SPEAKER_21]: Of course, Goonies, you know, we hoard that song like crazy here on Orange Lounge.

680
00:53:05,189 --> 00:53:22,761
[SPEAKER_21]: Arabatia, the Revenge song, love that song, and I actually passed it on, what's the second one up, not EX, that's the third one up, Hyper, is that the second level, it's like Basic and Hyper, see I don't know my poppin' music, it's so sad, the middle one, wherever it's ranked, like a 30 or something, 29, 30, I don't remember

681
00:53:24,608 --> 00:53:36,959
[SPEAKER_21]: Somebody needs to get me $1,000 for Christmas, so that way I can buy an ASC for 2DX, an ASC for pop music, and then import 8Style and as many pop music as I can before I'm bankrupt.

682
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:41,183
[SPEAKER_21]: So if you guys want to get me $1,000 for Christmas, that would be great.

683
00:53:45,007 --> 00:53:45,647
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

684
00:53:45,727 --> 00:53:48,330
[SPEAKER_19]: Did you play Poppin' 10 at all at that party that you went to, Jamie?

685
00:53:49,861 --> 00:53:50,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Poppin' 10

686
00:53:59,153 --> 00:54:03,415
[SPEAKER_04]: It was pretty, and watching Navi play is just insane.

687
00:54:03,975 --> 00:54:17,940
[SPEAKER_04]: He plays faster than anyone else I've seen, you know, but I just ended up watching it because I knew a lot of people wanted to play Pop Intense, so I just kind of left it at that.

688
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:20,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus, we were busy with Cranium anyway, so, you know.

689
00:54:23,126 --> 00:54:27,531
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, by the way, if anybody wants to call us, we just opened up the Skype line.

690
00:54:27,591 --> 00:54:33,378
[SPEAKER_21]: If you want to figure out what that's all about, head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on Interact With Us.

691
00:54:33,918 --> 00:54:39,485
[SPEAKER_21]: And we want to take some phone calls asking you guys that have gotten a chance to play 8th Style or Pop Music 10, what you guys think of it.

692
00:54:39,925 --> 00:54:42,368
[SPEAKER_21]: I have to say that the final verdict on 10, I kind of...

693
00:54:43,752 --> 00:54:49,535
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, obviously I need to play it more, and obviously I still want it, but I still think I kind of like 9 just a little bit better.

694
00:54:50,175 --> 00:54:56,738
[SPEAKER_21]: I just think 9 had some, it was just set up a little better, just kind of had some better songs, but 10's really good, don't get me wrong.

695
00:54:56,798 --> 00:55:00,060
[SPEAKER_21]: I would still buy 10 in a heartbeat, but I just think I like 9 a little bit better.

696
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:06,723
[SPEAKER_21]: But, anyway, Arcadian, you got to play a little bit of Poppin' 10, what'd you think?

697
00:55:07,694 --> 00:55:08,034
[SPEAKER_18]: Not bad.

698
00:55:08,895 --> 00:55:12,358
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't compare it to any other ones, because I haven't played any other ones.

699
00:55:12,438 --> 00:55:13,619
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, I thought you have played the other ones.

700
00:55:13,639 --> 00:55:14,819
[SPEAKER_18]: No, this is the first time I've ever played it.

701
00:55:14,879 --> 00:55:15,580
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, wow, okay.

702
00:55:16,781 --> 00:55:19,603
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's why you were playing 5-key in the beginning there.

703
00:55:19,623 --> 00:55:21,504
[SPEAKER_21]: I was kind of like, Acadian's playing 5-key.

704
00:55:22,365 --> 00:55:24,807
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, that was like three songs, and I said, let's go tonight.

705
00:55:25,147 --> 00:55:28,250
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's okay to play 5-key when you're first learning pop music.

706
00:55:28,270 --> 00:55:28,690
[SPEAKER_21]: That's okay.

707
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:30,231
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to take a call real fast.

708
00:55:30,591 --> 00:55:31,592
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, you're on Orange Lines Radio.

709
00:55:32,453 --> 00:55:33,514
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey there, Sky.

710
00:55:33,534 --> 00:55:34,154
[SPEAKER_10]: Siggy here.

711
00:55:34,374 --> 00:55:34,795
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, Siggy.

712
00:55:34,815 --> 00:55:35,255
[SPEAKER_21]: How you doing?

713
00:55:36,656 --> 00:55:37,377
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm doing fine.

714
00:55:37,557 --> 00:55:38,997
[SPEAKER_21]: You know what?

715
00:55:39,457 --> 00:55:43,019
[SPEAKER_21]: I finally figured out what you were talking about last week with the 2DX8 style.

716
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:46,360
[SPEAKER_21]: You remember how you said there was something in it that looked like extreme US?

717
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,941
[SPEAKER_21]: And a lot of people in the chat room were like, what the fuck is he talking about?

718
00:55:49,521 --> 00:55:50,021
[SPEAKER_21]: You remember that?

719
00:55:50,701 --> 00:55:50,961
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

720
00:55:51,021 --> 00:55:52,022
[SPEAKER_21]: I got what you meant now.

721
00:55:52,082 --> 00:55:56,983
[SPEAKER_21]: It was the menu in the beginning kind of had that like round wheel thing.

722
00:55:57,724 --> 00:55:58,624
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's the menu.

723
00:55:58,964 --> 00:55:59,404
[SPEAKER_21]: Gotcha.

724
00:55:59,824 --> 00:56:02,145
[SPEAKER_21]: So you got your copy of 8th style, yes?

725
00:56:02,485 --> 00:56:02,645
[SPEAKER_21]: Yep.

726
00:56:02,986 --> 00:56:03,946
[SPEAKER_21]: And how have you been enjoying it?

727
00:56:04,854 --> 00:56:06,154
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's really good.

728
00:56:06,855 --> 00:56:12,236
[SPEAKER_10]: I was one of the lucky ones who got the 2DX Red e-amusement card because after November 18th, they don't have it anymore.

729
00:56:12,636 --> 00:56:12,996
[SPEAKER_21]: Really?

730
00:56:13,556 --> 00:56:13,856
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

731
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:18,118
[SPEAKER_21]: So, is there anything special about the card or is it just the fact that, hey, I got a card?

732
00:56:19,338 --> 00:56:25,760
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, I wanted to use the 2DX Red e-amusement card at AI because they have the e-amusement card readers.

733
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:26,560
[SPEAKER_21]: That's what I heard.

734
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:32,722
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, I'm actually going to be able to go to Arcade Infinity next week, I'm hoping.

735
00:56:33,162 --> 00:56:34,242
[SPEAKER_10]: The e-amusement card over there

736
00:56:35,424 --> 00:56:39,106
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I don't have any amusement card because I'm ghetto poor and I haven't bought anything yet.

737
00:56:39,126 --> 00:56:39,786
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I meant.

738
00:56:40,066 --> 00:56:41,047
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, that's what I'm thinking about doing.

739
00:56:41,067 --> 00:56:45,669
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm thinking about buying, depending on how much they cost, I might buy a bunch and give some away here on the station.

740
00:56:46,009 --> 00:56:46,569
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm thinking about it.

741
00:56:47,289 --> 00:56:47,990
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's cool.

742
00:56:48,230 --> 00:56:49,070
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, thinking about it.

743
00:56:50,251 --> 00:56:55,393
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, recently I double-aid a V35 on 7-key.

744
00:56:56,313 --> 00:57:00,515
[SPEAKER_21]: See, V35 is one of those songs I used to be really good at, but then I just suck it up now.

745
00:57:00,555 --> 00:57:01,436
[SPEAKER_21]: What is that you're holding up there?

746
00:57:01,536 --> 00:57:01,936
[SPEAKER_21]: A Namco?

747
00:57:02,893 --> 00:57:04,534
[SPEAKER_05]: My Tekken 5 character data card.

748
00:57:05,414 --> 00:57:06,174
[SPEAKER_21]: Get on topic!

749
00:57:07,315 --> 00:57:07,775
[SPEAKER_21]: No, it's cool.

750
00:57:08,776 --> 00:57:10,176
[SPEAKER_21]: Have you gotten to play Pop Music 10 at all?

751
00:57:10,876 --> 00:57:11,457
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, no.

752
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:15,939
[SPEAKER_10]: The last time I played Popping Music was Popping Music 9 back in San Francisco.

753
00:57:16,179 --> 00:57:17,599
[SPEAKER_21]: See, but isn't Pop Music 9 great?

754
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:20,941
[SPEAKER_21]: I think so, anyway.

755
00:57:21,961 --> 00:57:26,163
[SPEAKER_21]: So, anything else you want to share about 2DX8 style, your experiences you're having with it?

756
00:57:27,023 --> 00:57:30,865
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, um... There's a thing about the...

757
00:57:32,085 --> 00:57:41,288
[SPEAKER_10]: Getting the hidden songs, 2DX Red songs, you don't have to, you don't have to, about the easy things, it turns out to be false.

758
00:57:42,689 --> 00:57:43,129
[SPEAKER_21]: What do you mean?

759
00:57:43,869 --> 00:57:54,573
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't play easy songs by unlocking, by using an easy option.

760
00:57:55,073 --> 00:57:56,894
[SPEAKER_21]: So you can't play an easy to unlock those songs?

761
00:57:57,274 --> 00:57:57,734
[SPEAKER_10]: You can.

762
00:57:58,034 --> 00:57:58,614
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, you can?

763
00:57:59,114 --> 00:57:59,374
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

764
00:57:59,454 --> 00:58:00,855
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, shit, that makes it easy, doesn't it?

765
00:58:02,188 --> 00:58:05,172
[SPEAKER_21]: And what is the requirement again to start unlocking some of these 2DX Red songs?

766
00:58:05,192 --> 00:58:06,133
[SPEAKER_21]: Because I actually don't remember.

767
00:58:06,674 --> 00:58:12,260
[SPEAKER_10]: Play at least about a hundred songs to unlock Spiral Galaxy and Taiyou.

768
00:58:13,642 --> 00:58:13,982
[SPEAKER_21]: Wow.

769
00:58:14,803 --> 00:58:15,484
[SPEAKER_21]: A hundred songs?

770
00:58:16,025 --> 00:58:21,652
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, yeah, just mostly light sevens or, you know, light sevens to seven key songs.

771
00:58:22,065 --> 00:58:23,786
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not afraid of playing 7-key.

772
00:58:23,806 --> 00:58:25,648
[SPEAKER_21]: I've got to play some more to get better at it.

773
00:58:25,748 --> 00:58:26,869
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's... Play more Light 7.

774
00:58:27,529 --> 00:58:28,990
[SPEAKER_10]: Just for the heck of it.

775
00:58:29,010 --> 00:58:29,491
[SPEAKER_10]: Just for the heck.

776
00:58:29,731 --> 00:58:37,376
[SPEAKER_21]: I would play... Now, see, Light 7 would be the kind of thing I would play to whore my VJ Army account up if I had one.

777
00:58:37,697 --> 00:58:38,998
[SPEAKER_21]: Hypothetically, if I had one.

778
00:58:39,018 --> 00:58:41,399
[SPEAKER_21]: I'd be all, look at all these triple A's I got!

779
00:58:41,419 --> 00:58:42,100
[SPEAKER_21]: Of course, it was on Light 7.

780
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:44,642
[SPEAKER_21]: But, man, I'm good.

781
00:58:44,922 --> 00:58:47,344
[SPEAKER_21]: Because I know that there's people out there that do that.

782
00:58:47,544 --> 00:58:48,305
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, but that's okay.

783
00:58:48,345 --> 00:58:49,726
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, Light 7s are songs, too.

784
00:58:49,746 --> 00:58:50,726
[SPEAKER_21]: You have every right.

785
00:58:51,107 --> 00:58:51,487
[SPEAKER_21]: But, you know,

786
00:58:52,887 --> 00:58:54,848
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's another for Random Plus.

787
00:58:55,268 --> 00:58:58,269
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to play at least 100 songs to unlock Random Plus.

788
00:58:58,569 --> 00:59:05,332
[SPEAKER_10]: And what exactly does Random Plus do again for those that... Random Plus is where the turntable is now included in the shuffle.

789
00:59:06,332 --> 00:59:09,313
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, okay, I gotcha.

790
00:59:09,613 --> 00:59:13,755
[SPEAKER_21]: That would be so hard if you got some scales that... Oh, God, that's pretty crazy.

791
00:59:14,375 --> 00:59:16,376
[SPEAKER_10]: Especially, you know, especially war games.

792
00:59:18,914 --> 00:59:19,734
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate that song.

793
00:59:19,794 --> 00:59:20,875
[SPEAKER_21]: I can only imagine.

794
00:59:21,155 --> 00:59:23,856
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, Wargame on 7Key was never a big problem for me.

795
00:59:23,876 --> 00:59:26,937
[SPEAKER_21]: For some reason, Scratching, I'm like, I'm okay with it.

796
00:59:26,957 --> 00:59:27,897
[SPEAKER_10]: I like that.

797
00:59:28,297 --> 00:59:32,498
[SPEAKER_21]: Checking You Out was the second 7 star I ever beat, and now I understand it's an 8 star.

798
00:59:32,879 --> 00:59:36,940
[SPEAKER_21]: So, like, I beat an 8 star, like, when I was beating my first 7 star.

799
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:38,100
[SPEAKER_21]: That is so crazy to me.

800
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:40,261
[SPEAKER_21]: But, for some reason, Scratching has never bothered me.

801
00:59:41,176 --> 00:59:49,942
[SPEAKER_10]: After you play 100 songs with random, just hold key 2 and then wait for the random to go red.

802
00:59:51,103 --> 00:59:51,864
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's how it works?

803
00:59:52,384 --> 00:59:53,225
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's how it works.

804
00:59:53,425 --> 00:59:57,968
[SPEAKER_21]: So those of you guys that are feeling a little crazy and want to play some random with the turntable, there you have it.

805
00:59:59,569 --> 00:59:59,889
[SPEAKER_21]: Interesting.

806
01:00:00,249 --> 01:00:03,592
[SPEAKER_21]: What would you say would be your favorite new video in 2DXA style?

807
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:06,714
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't seen all of them because I'm really busy playing them.

808
01:00:07,967 --> 01:00:09,148
[SPEAKER_10]: Playing the seven key songs.

809
01:00:09,529 --> 01:00:12,311
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'd say I like Nebula Grasper a lot.

810
01:00:12,531 --> 01:00:14,313
[SPEAKER_21]: Nebula Grasper's got a pretty good video to it.

811
01:00:14,373 --> 01:00:17,016
[SPEAKER_21]: It's one of those futuristic, typical kind of things.

812
01:00:17,056 --> 01:00:19,278
[SPEAKER_21]: It kind of reminded me of Hyperboundary Yate a little bit.

813
01:00:19,318 --> 01:00:23,182
[SPEAKER_21]: Because, you know, that was an LED song too, and it had all the futuristic graphics with it.

814
01:00:23,442 --> 01:00:24,503
[SPEAKER_21]: Kind of reminded me of that a little bit.

815
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:30,168
[SPEAKER_10]: And I bought a 2DX Red, so I really like Spiral Galaxy as well.

816
01:00:31,409 --> 01:00:32,991
[SPEAKER_21]: Were you able to get the V-Rare when you got...

817
01:00:33,985 --> 01:00:35,666
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, no, no, I didn't.

818
01:00:36,306 --> 01:00:37,607
[SPEAKER_10]: Just a regular one I ordered.

819
01:00:37,847 --> 01:00:38,288
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, okay.

820
01:00:39,248 --> 01:00:39,508
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

821
01:00:40,109 --> 01:00:42,030
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, anything else you want to share about 2DXHTEL?

822
01:00:42,730 --> 01:00:44,091
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, nothing much else.

823
01:00:44,311 --> 01:00:44,571
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

824
01:00:44,711 --> 01:00:46,372
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, we'll talk to you later then, I guess.

825
01:00:47,033 --> 01:00:47,693
[SPEAKER_21]: Have a good one, Siggy.

826
01:00:48,093 --> 01:00:48,353
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

827
01:00:48,413 --> 01:00:48,613
[SPEAKER_21]: Later.

828
01:00:48,754 --> 01:00:49,034
[SPEAKER_21]: Later.

829
01:00:50,154 --> 01:00:51,155
[SPEAKER_21]: I like getting phone calls.

830
01:00:51,195 --> 01:00:51,715
[SPEAKER_21]: That was fun.

831
01:00:52,756 --> 01:00:53,016
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

832
01:00:53,616 --> 01:00:56,498
[SPEAKER_21]: People say in our chat room right now is that they're talking about 2DX too much.

833
01:00:56,538 --> 01:00:59,440
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, it is the news that's going on right now, you know, you guys, but fine.

834
01:01:00,653 --> 01:01:02,175
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to talk about a little bit of DDR.

835
01:01:02,195 --> 01:01:06,238
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to try and get the I Feel, the new remix for you.

836
01:01:06,278 --> 01:01:09,521
[SPEAKER_21]: Loki's going to get that taken care of during the next break, right?

837
01:01:10,142 --> 01:01:10,422
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

838
01:01:10,742 --> 01:01:10,942
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.

839
01:01:11,082 --> 01:01:13,024
[SPEAKER_21]: Then I guess we're going to go to a break so we can get that song.

840
01:01:13,284 --> 01:01:15,987
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to hear some music from DDR Festival, some more music.

841
01:01:16,547 --> 01:01:17,108
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, Jamie.

842
01:01:18,329 --> 01:01:18,489
[SPEAKER_21]: What?

843
01:01:18,509 --> 01:01:18,609
[SPEAKER_21]: What?

844
01:01:19,295 --> 01:01:20,275
[SPEAKER_21]: Udoru...

845
01:01:43,018 --> 01:01:43,818
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, that song.

846
01:01:43,999 --> 01:01:46,880
[SPEAKER_21]: There's like a new version of it in Festival, so we're going to hear this.

847
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:48,641
[SPEAKER_21]: I haven't heard this one yet, so I've got to check this out.

848
01:01:49,021 --> 01:01:56,465
[SPEAKER_21]: A remix of I Need You, which was a song that was kind of eh in DDR Max 2 USA, but we'll hear it and see if it's any better.

849
01:01:57,806 --> 01:02:03,568
[SPEAKER_20]: Here's the thing about I Need You, and it wasn't in, well, yeah, Max 2 USA.

850
01:02:03,769 --> 01:02:06,350
[SPEAKER_20]: This was the one that was on the VRare for the last mix.

851
01:02:07,642 --> 01:02:08,463
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, that wasn't too bad.

852
01:02:08,583 --> 01:02:09,323
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, so we'll check it out.

853
01:02:09,343 --> 01:02:15,347
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to check out these songs, and we'll be back, and we're going to talk a little bit more about Ultramix 2, some of the news there, and play that new song from Ultramix 2.

854
01:02:15,528 --> 01:02:18,590
[SPEAKER_21]: And, of course, the cage match, FU's of the Week, all that good stuff coming up.

855
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:25,274
[SPEAKER_21]: And in the chat room, they're saying, look, since you're so white, Sky, just say Dancine Pomponcolin.

856
01:02:25,715 --> 01:02:27,016
[SPEAKER_21]: And even that I can't say right.

857
01:02:27,356 --> 01:02:28,977
[SPEAKER_21]: I just, I wasn't cut out for radio.

858
01:02:29,017 --> 01:02:29,497
[SPEAKER_21]: What can I say?

859
01:02:29,998 --> 01:02:30,438
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll be back.

860
01:02:56,925 --> 01:02:58,927

Thanks for watching!

864
01:06:06,398 --> 01:06:07,539
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching.

865
01:06:07,759 --> 01:06:09,080
[SPEAKER_08]: See you next time.

866
01:06:36,069 --> 01:06:39,723
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't feel like I'm going to study, but at this point in time, I do.

867
01:07:14,065 --> 01:07:22,555
[SPEAKER_21]: Gaming Radio, so uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

868
01:07:22,735 --> 01:07:24,096
[SPEAKER_21]: Orange Lounge Radio.

869
01:07:27,881 --> 01:07:29,483
[SPEAKER_21]: God bless you, Tom Brokaw.

870
01:07:30,865 --> 01:07:31,866
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, he finally retired.

871
01:07:32,706 --> 01:07:33,046
[SPEAKER_21]: He did?

872
01:07:33,287 --> 01:07:33,607
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

873
01:07:34,207 --> 01:07:35,028
[SPEAKER_21]: This is his last week.

874
01:07:35,048 --> 01:07:35,548
[SPEAKER_21]: We had time.

875
01:07:36,549 --> 01:07:40,191
[SPEAKER_21]: One of the most highly rated episodes of the show of all time or something like that.

876
01:07:40,211 --> 01:07:40,512
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know.

877
01:07:40,532 --> 01:07:41,032
[SPEAKER_21]: Something like that.

878
01:07:41,092 --> 01:07:41,412
[SPEAKER_21]: Crazy.

879
01:07:42,953 --> 01:07:46,375
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway, we are going to be playing the new I Feel remix.

880
01:07:46,395 --> 01:07:46,796
[SPEAKER_21]: We just...

881
01:07:47,296 --> 01:07:48,616
[SPEAKER_21]: We ripped it during the break there.

882
01:07:48,676 --> 01:07:52,357
[SPEAKER_21]: Loki, our tech massa, is working on it right now, trying to get it all perfect.

883
01:07:52,777 --> 01:08:02,179
[SPEAKER_21]: I said we should just rip it out of edit mode, but apparently if you try to rip it in edit mode, it cuts off the very beginning little speech thing, because it starts off and goes, Do you feel it?

884
01:08:02,279 --> 01:08:04,600
[SPEAKER_21]: Like, it sounds like one of those, like, speaking spells or something saying it.

885
01:08:05,220 --> 01:08:06,920
[SPEAKER_21]: And, uh, Loki was like, No!

886
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:07,760
[SPEAKER_21]: We can't have that!

887
01:08:08,020 --> 01:08:10,781
[SPEAKER_21]: So he made us go back and do it in edit mode, so, whatever.

888
01:08:11,421 --> 01:08:12,022
[SPEAKER_19]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

889
01:08:39,113 --> 01:08:43,135
[SPEAKER_05]: That's Pump Up the Volume where I just go crazy and play whatever.

890
01:08:43,736 --> 01:08:46,077
[SPEAKER_05]: Although if you're in our chat room, you can make a request.

891
01:08:46,197 --> 01:08:48,719
[SPEAKER_05]: And if I think that it doesn't totally suck ass, I'll play it.

892
01:08:49,619 --> 01:08:50,140
[SPEAKER_21]: Amen to that.

893
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:59,265
[SPEAKER_21]: And then Wednesday nights is the Oldie and Moldie Orange Lounge Radio Show where basically we play a show from two years ago for your listening amusement.

894
01:08:59,625 --> 01:09:01,046
[SPEAKER_21]: Listen to how much we used to suck.

895
01:09:01,086 --> 01:09:03,708
[SPEAKER_21]: If you think we suck now, like we really sucked then.

896
01:09:04,869 --> 01:09:08,191
[SPEAKER_21]: And then Thursday nights, Outside the Box at 7 o'clock.

897
01:09:08,971 --> 01:09:13,316
[SPEAKER_21]: myself, RicePrincess, and LikeyStyle talking about the latest and greatest in video gaming.

898
01:09:13,637 --> 01:09:15,119
[SPEAKER_21]: This last week was a pretty good show.

899
01:09:15,159 --> 01:09:16,680
[SPEAKER_21]: You missed a good time if you missed this week.

900
01:09:16,741 --> 01:09:17,782
[SPEAKER_21]: We had a good time.

901
01:09:18,543 --> 01:09:23,008
[SPEAKER_21]: And then Friday nights, it's not on this station, but it's over on The Freak on DDR Freak Radio.

902
01:09:23,068 --> 01:09:28,555
[SPEAKER_21]: The Rewinds, in case you missed a previous episode of Orange Lounge Radio, you can catch it over there, up to date.

903
01:09:29,175 --> 01:09:34,320
[SPEAKER_21]: Actually, the show they're going to be playing this Friday is last week's show, which was the one where we had the MidiHead interview.

904
01:09:34,740 --> 01:09:38,883
[SPEAKER_21]: If you guys missed the interview with MidiHead, awesome guy, awesome interview.

905
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:41,325
[SPEAKER_21]: You have to check it out, so go listen to Freak on Friday.

906
01:09:41,405 --> 01:09:47,210
[SPEAKER_21]: Also, the karaoke cage match, by the way, was on last Friday, and of course, Loki won.

907
01:09:47,230 --> 01:09:49,091
[SPEAKER_21]: Was there any surprise in anyone's mind?

908
01:09:49,272 --> 01:09:49,752
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't think so.

909
01:09:51,502 --> 01:09:55,525
[SPEAKER_21]: I've got to plug the LiveJournal community, because we haven't plugged that in a while.

910
01:09:56,345 --> 01:10:04,370
[SPEAKER_21]: If you guys have a LiveJournal, which I know a lot of you do in this day and age, we're starting to move into a LiveJournally-centered internet, head on over to our LiveJournal community.

911
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:10,194
[SPEAKER_21]: It's just username OrangeLounge on LiveJournal, and if you join it, you get some of the latest announcements on what's going on in the station.

912
01:10:10,514 --> 01:10:17,718
[SPEAKER_21]: Sometimes we propose ideas for changes to the station on our LiveJournal, and we get your feedback there, so it's just a nice little community.

913
01:10:17,978 --> 01:10:20,440
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a way for you to meet other listeners of OrangeLoungeRadio.

914
01:10:21,252 --> 01:10:22,152
[SPEAKER_21]: Crazy people like us.

915
01:10:24,313 --> 01:10:24,653
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's see.

916
01:10:25,093 --> 01:10:25,933
[SPEAKER_21]: DDR Ultramix 2.

917
01:10:26,833 --> 01:10:29,494
[SPEAKER_21]: Been a game we've been talking about a hell of a lot lately, I gotta say.

918
01:10:29,554 --> 01:10:32,574
[SPEAKER_21]: But SongPack, I keep calling it Service Pack.

919
01:10:32,954 --> 01:10:34,775
[SPEAKER_21]: SongPack 7 came out this week.

920
01:10:34,855 --> 01:10:39,876
[SPEAKER_21]: Finally, a lot of us were expecting that SongPack 7 was going to be out when the game came out.

921
01:10:39,896 --> 01:10:41,476
[SPEAKER_21]: But for whatever reason, there was a delay.

922
01:10:41,856 --> 01:10:44,777
[SPEAKER_21]: Sounds like there might have been some kind of bug that prevented things.

923
01:10:44,897 --> 01:10:45,197
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know.

924
01:10:45,757 --> 01:10:50,079
[SPEAKER_21]: A lot of people bitchin' and moanin' because SongPack 7 has a lot of old songs in it.

925
01:10:50,099 --> 01:10:51,760
[SPEAKER_21]: We were talking about this a little bit last week.

926
01:10:52,541 --> 01:10:56,543
[SPEAKER_21]: But SongPack 7 has End of the Century and La Senorita and Silent Hill.

927
01:10:57,223 --> 01:11:00,165
[SPEAKER_21]: A lot of old classic DDR songs.

928
01:11:00,925 --> 01:11:03,226
[SPEAKER_21]: But I guess played out to a lot of people as well.

929
01:11:03,526 --> 01:11:04,147
[SPEAKER_21]: Era as well.

930
01:11:04,407 --> 01:11:08,349
[SPEAKER_21]: So you get some tack finally in DDR Ultimix 2.

931
01:11:09,990 --> 01:11:12,351
[SPEAKER_21]: But a lot of these songs, since they're old, they're kind of played out.

932
01:11:12,391 --> 01:11:13,552
[SPEAKER_21]: So they're getting a lot of kind of...

933
01:11:14,577 --> 01:11:15,458
[SPEAKER_21]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

934
01:11:34,657 --> 01:11:36,517
[SPEAKER_21]: is another artist that's over on a different drum.

935
01:11:36,557 --> 01:11:40,038
[SPEAKER_21]: The background for this song has the website address.

936
01:11:40,338 --> 01:11:48,620
[SPEAKER_21]: You may have noticed a lot of the different drum songs, a lot of those, like the Jesper Kidd, a lot of the new songs in Ultramix 2 have websites in their background.

937
01:11:48,660 --> 01:11:51,120
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's kind of interesting that we're getting those in some of the song packs as well.

938
01:11:52,440 --> 01:12:02,422
[SPEAKER_21]: But I think in visiting Junk Circuit's website, I think there's actually a lot in common between Junk Circuit and Nuropa, who does the song Standing Still in Time.

939
01:12:03,035 --> 01:12:22,564
[SPEAKER_21]: Because they have the same website contact email So, kind of interesting Alright Anyway They're telling us in the chatroom to stop talking about the song and play the damn thing already That's fine, we'll get to it I'm going to copy it over right now Loki's put the finishing touches on it So we'll go ahead and play that for you But really first, Loki, what did you think of this remix?

940
01:12:23,365 --> 01:12:25,866
[SPEAKER_20]: It's better than the other one You didn't like the other one?

941
01:12:25,906 --> 01:12:27,127
[SPEAKER_21]: Why's that?

942
01:12:27,147 --> 01:12:32,289
[SPEAKER_20]: The other one just kind of sucked I don't know, it was just kind of eh, not much different This is a lot better

943
01:12:33,331 --> 01:12:37,974
[SPEAKER_21]: I do like this one a little bit better too, but I kind of like the old one as well, I gotta admit.

944
01:12:38,114 --> 01:12:39,455
[SPEAKER_21]: So, I don't know, what do I know?

945
01:12:40,636 --> 01:12:43,578
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, I gotta copy it over.

946
01:12:47,841 --> 01:12:50,904
[SPEAKER_21]: I guess there was a big tournament on Ultramix 2 tonight, online.

947
01:12:51,464 --> 01:12:53,405
[SPEAKER_21]: There was a lot of people talking about it over on DDR Freak.

948
01:12:53,586 --> 01:12:54,166
[SPEAKER_21]: I missed it.

949
01:12:54,887 --> 01:12:59,450
[SPEAKER_21]: It wasn't something, I knew I'd get my ass kicked so I didn't want to participate, but I guess it went pretty well from what I hear.

950
01:13:00,424 --> 01:13:02,606
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, I'll stop talking and start playing.

951
01:13:02,666 --> 01:13:03,367
[SPEAKER_21]: Here it is.

952
01:13:03,767 --> 01:13:06,590
[SPEAKER_21]: Orange Launch Radio presents the brand new I Feel remix.

953
01:13:06,630 --> 01:13:07,791
[SPEAKER_21]: It's the Junk Circuit mix.

954
01:13:07,991 --> 01:13:08,491
[SPEAKER_21]: Enjoy, guys.

955
01:13:09,212 --> 01:13:09,953
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you feel it?

956
01:13:33,407 --> 01:13:34,249
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for watching!

957
01:14:28,348 --> 01:14:29,090
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you hear it?

958
01:14:59,052 --> 01:15:00,033
[SPEAKER_21]: I feel the Junk Circuit Mix

959
01:15:24,505 --> 01:15:25,646
[SPEAKER_21]: Nothing top secure, Yamoga.

960
01:15:26,166 --> 01:15:27,107
[SPEAKER_21]: What'd you think of that, Bradley?

961
01:15:27,147 --> 01:15:33,391
[SPEAKER_18]: I liked it, except I think that I feel that little... Hold the bottom of the mic, it's breaking up a little bit, the cord's loose.

962
01:15:33,771 --> 01:15:35,612
[SPEAKER_21]: That's alright, we're ghetto here, we don't have good equipment.

963
01:15:36,452 --> 01:15:37,553
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, now you're cutting out completely.

964
01:15:38,734 --> 01:15:39,074
[SPEAKER_14]: There you are.

965
01:15:39,214 --> 01:15:39,534
[SPEAKER_14]: Am I here?

966
01:15:39,654 --> 01:15:40,255
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, you're here.

967
01:15:40,675 --> 01:15:41,796
[SPEAKER_21]: No, now you're gone again!

968
01:15:45,498 --> 01:15:45,678
[SPEAKER_21]: Nope.

969
01:15:46,759 --> 01:15:48,620
[SPEAKER_21]: We need to buy a new mic, I think, something's going on.

970
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:50,241
[SPEAKER_21]: Steal this one real fast.

971
01:15:51,940 --> 01:15:52,220
[SPEAKER_21]: Dough.

972
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:53,681
[SPEAKER_21]: That one's dying.

973
01:15:54,701 --> 01:15:56,322
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to cry for that microphone.

974
01:15:56,362 --> 01:15:58,823
[SPEAKER_21]: There we go.

975
01:15:58,863 --> 01:15:59,283
[SPEAKER_21]: Try that one.

976
01:15:59,603 --> 01:16:01,084
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I thought it was pretty good.

977
01:16:01,684 --> 01:16:06,626
[SPEAKER_18]: Except I think that little computer I feel it voice is a bad touch.

978
01:16:07,507 --> 01:16:08,968
[SPEAKER_18]: If they left it out, it would make it better.

979
01:16:09,508 --> 01:16:10,868
[SPEAKER_21]: Jazz in our chatroom agrees with you.

980
01:16:10,908 --> 01:16:14,830
[SPEAKER_21]: He says the whole can you feel it samples just sounds fucking cheesy is what he says.

981
01:16:15,290 --> 01:16:15,530
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

982
01:16:16,111 --> 01:16:18,132
[SPEAKER_21]: And Jamie's yelling from the laundry room that she agrees.

983
01:16:18,912 --> 01:16:19,052
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

984
01:16:19,660 --> 01:16:20,361
[SPEAKER_21]: Overall, I like it.

985
01:16:21,061 --> 01:16:22,302
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I think it's pretty good.

986
01:16:22,683 --> 01:16:28,868
[SPEAKER_21]: I think the, uh, can you feel it is a little weird, but it, I don't know, it's different.

987
01:16:29,689 --> 01:16:30,850
[SPEAKER_21]: I give them points for trying.

988
01:16:30,910 --> 01:16:32,371
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a good remix.

989
01:16:32,411 --> 01:16:33,412
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a fun song to play.

990
01:16:35,313 --> 01:16:36,234
[SPEAKER_21]: The steps are kind of interesting.

991
01:16:36,254 --> 01:16:38,736
[SPEAKER_05]: It took something good and added a bunch of extraneous crap to it.

992
01:16:39,697 --> 01:16:42,860
[SPEAKER_21]: The steps, is there any DDR remix that you've liked so far?

993
01:16:44,662 --> 01:16:48,551
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked the Let This Face one that you interviewed last week.

994
01:16:48,571 --> 01:16:49,012
[SPEAKER_21]: Middy Head?

995
01:16:49,213 --> 01:16:49,493
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

996
01:16:49,634 --> 01:16:49,914
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

997
01:16:49,934 --> 01:16:51,157
[SPEAKER_05]: That one was good.

998
01:16:53,571 --> 01:16:54,131
[SPEAKER_21]: What's his face?

999
01:16:56,012 --> 01:16:56,872
[SPEAKER_21]: I wasn't here!

1000
01:17:00,053 --> 01:17:00,973
[SPEAKER_21]: I wasn't here!

1001
01:17:16,597 --> 01:17:17,038
[SPEAKER_21]: What is that?

1002
01:17:17,138 --> 01:17:18,479
[SPEAKER_21]: DDR Console Games Forum?

1003
01:17:18,759 --> 01:17:21,941
[SPEAKER_21]: There's a little sticky announcement thingy where you can ask MidiHead a question.

1004
01:17:21,981 --> 01:17:30,528
[SPEAKER_21]: So if you missed getting your question last week, because we took some questions from our listeners, but if you missed your chance to ask MidiHead a question, they are taking question submissions right now.

1005
01:17:30,588 --> 01:17:32,169
[SPEAKER_21]: So go check that out if you'd like.

1006
01:17:32,549 --> 01:17:33,870
[SPEAKER_21]: What did you think of that remix, Angel?

1007
01:17:34,190 --> 01:17:36,672
[SPEAKER_21]: You like everything, so I know you're going to have something good to say about it.

1008
01:17:38,394 --> 01:17:44,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I liked the first one from Silent Hill when we first did that one.

1009
01:17:44,670 --> 01:17:45,170
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1010
01:18:08,618 --> 01:18:10,759
[SPEAKER_21]: I want to take some calls on the Skype line.

1011
01:18:10,819 --> 01:18:15,860
[SPEAKER_21]: If you want to give us a call, head on over to www.OrangeLaunchRadio.com and click on Interact With Us.

1012
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:21,782
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm kind of curious about some of your guys' feedback on Ultramix 2, specifically SongPack 7, if you've had a chance to check it out.

1013
01:18:22,322 --> 01:18:37,306
[SPEAKER_21]: Any online experiences you might have had on Ultramix 2, and even if you want to talk about a DDR Festival, because we haven't talked a whole lot about DDR Festival, and that's just because none of us in Sacramento, I don't think a single person in Sacramento that I know of, anyway, has bought the game, so we don't know what to say about it.

1014
01:18:38,214 --> 01:18:41,095
[SPEAKER_20]: and to add to that, if you'd like to talk about Drawn together as well.

1015
01:18:42,376 --> 01:18:47,978
[SPEAKER_21]: No, that's not... What?

1016
01:18:49,718 --> 01:18:50,599
[SPEAKER_21]: I have an opinion, no I don't.

1017
01:18:52,339 --> 01:18:52,759
[SPEAKER_21]: Shut up.

1018
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:56,421
[SPEAKER_19]: Did you ever get a chance to play Ultramix 2, Jamie?

1019
01:18:56,521 --> 01:18:57,961
[SPEAKER_19]: Did you guys pick that up at your place?

1020
01:18:59,202 --> 01:18:59,362
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

1021
01:18:59,442 --> 01:19:00,042
[SPEAKER_19]: Are you going to get it?

1022
01:19:02,170 --> 01:19:02,631
[SPEAKER_19]: It's fun.

1023
01:19:02,931 --> 01:19:03,912
[SPEAKER_19]: Dot, dot, dot.

1024
01:19:03,972 --> 01:19:04,653
[SPEAKER_19]: It's fun!

1025
01:19:05,434 --> 01:19:05,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

1026
01:19:06,155 --> 01:19:06,596
[SPEAKER_19]: You should.

1027
01:19:06,836 --> 01:19:10,000
[SPEAKER_05]: The house has been rearranged in Halo 2 land position.

1028
01:19:11,061 --> 01:19:13,564
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no room to put any dance pads or anything.

1029
01:19:14,485 --> 01:19:15,386
[SPEAKER_21]: Look at this place.

1030
01:19:15,647 --> 01:19:16,768
[SPEAKER_21]: Hello, you can sit on our camp.

1031
01:19:16,788 --> 01:19:17,849
[SPEAKER_05]: You have infinitely more room.

1032
01:19:17,910 --> 01:19:18,490
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan's got the...

1033
01:19:20,052 --> 01:19:27,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Normally in my living room we have the TV on one wall, the couch on one wall, and the loveseat back on the far wall.

1034
01:19:28,239 --> 01:19:35,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Now the loveseat and couch are back to back with just enough room to have a place to put your legs and an Xbox between TVs.

1035
01:19:36,686 --> 01:19:38,247
[SPEAKER_21]: It is currently in LAN mode.

1036
01:19:38,848 --> 01:19:42,110
[SPEAKER_21]: Are you guys hosting a bunch of Halo 2 parties or something?

1037
01:19:42,130 --> 01:19:43,832
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan did on his birthday on Monday.

1038
01:19:44,072 --> 01:19:45,173
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, his birthday was Monday, huh?

1039
01:19:45,213 --> 01:19:45,493
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1040
01:19:45,573 --> 01:19:46,254
[SPEAKER_21]: Happy birthday, Dan.

1041
01:19:47,148 --> 01:19:48,128
[SPEAKER_07]: I wasn't here for that.

1042
01:19:48,969 --> 01:19:50,269
[SPEAKER_07]: He told me I should feel guilty.

1043
01:19:51,530 --> 01:19:52,430
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, now that's not true.

1044
01:19:55,011 --> 01:19:55,571
[SPEAKER_21]: That's not true.

1045
01:19:59,092 --> 01:20:01,873
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I don't think anybody's calling us on the Skype line, so what can we do?

1046
01:20:02,533 --> 01:20:03,494
[SPEAKER_21]: Damn it, they suck!

1047
01:20:03,534 --> 01:20:06,515
[SPEAKER_21]: Except now they're talking about Drawn Together in our chat room.

1048
01:20:06,995 --> 01:20:08,635
[SPEAKER_21]: You freaking ass, Loki.

1049
01:20:09,676 --> 01:20:10,036
[SPEAKER_19]: Jerk.

1050
01:20:11,297 --> 01:20:18,625
[SPEAKER_21]: Loki, now you keep telling me that you're going to start playing Ultramix 2 because I notice that every time I've been playing it, you're like, yeah, I need to play that.

1051
01:20:19,486 --> 01:20:20,668
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I need to play that.

1052
01:20:21,288 --> 01:20:22,289
[SPEAKER_21]: Are you actually going to be playing?

1053
01:20:22,329 --> 01:20:23,551
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, we're finally getting a call.

1054
01:20:24,292 --> 01:20:29,037
[SPEAKER_21]: You're going to reprieve for now, but as soon as this call is done, we're going to ask you about that.

1055
01:20:29,337 --> 01:20:30,639
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1056
01:20:32,264 --> 01:20:33,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Legend of Zaku here.

1057
01:20:33,364 --> 01:20:34,005
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, Zaku.

1058
01:20:34,065 --> 01:20:34,485
[SPEAKER_21]: How are you?

1059
01:20:35,145 --> 01:20:40,086
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have that much to share because, you know, as I said, you know, I'm a college student.

1060
01:20:40,106 --> 01:20:41,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Then get off the phone!

1061
01:20:41,087 --> 01:20:41,927
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm kidding.

1062
01:20:41,967 --> 01:20:43,787
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have a PS2 or an Xbox.

1063
01:20:43,847 --> 01:20:47,608
[SPEAKER_02]: I might get one this Christmas, but I'm kind of iffy on which one should I get.

1064
01:20:48,289 --> 01:20:49,529
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Bomani-wise, that is.

1065
01:20:49,649 --> 01:20:51,410
[SPEAKER_21]: So you don't have a PS2 or an Xbox.

1066
01:20:51,430 --> 01:20:55,551
[SPEAKER_21]: So you're asking the age-old question, which system should I get?

1067
01:20:55,831 --> 01:20:59,732
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but with regards to not only, you know, games, but also Bomani as well.

1068
01:21:01,229 --> 01:21:03,151
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm adding a little kick to it.

1069
01:21:03,171 --> 01:21:05,033
[SPEAKER_20]: And you have nothing to add about Drawn Together.

1070
01:21:06,114 --> 01:21:06,554
[SPEAKER_21]: He didn't hear that.

1071
01:21:06,594 --> 01:21:07,055
[SPEAKER_20]: What?

1072
01:21:07,115 --> 01:21:09,638
[SPEAKER_20]: And you have nothing to add about Drawn Together.

1073
01:21:10,058 --> 01:21:12,240
[SPEAKER_20]: I did see South Park last Wednesday, but that was about it.

1074
01:21:12,260 --> 01:21:12,761
[SPEAKER_21]: No, no, no.

1075
01:21:12,881 --> 01:21:15,023
[SPEAKER_21]: Quit trying to derail this program, Loki, Zaku.

1076
01:21:15,323 --> 01:21:15,543
[SPEAKER_21]: Shame.

1077
01:21:15,944 --> 01:21:17,966
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

1078
01:21:18,807 --> 01:21:21,569
[SPEAKER_21]: As far as Xbox versus PS2, here it is, basically.

1079
01:21:22,549 --> 01:21:36,237
[SPEAKER_21]: If you're interested in something that's going to remind you of the arcade, something that's going to bring the arcade experience to the home, something where there's a lot of different songs available, something with iToy support, if you want to get your hands involved, go for the PS2.

1080
01:21:37,317 --> 01:21:43,861
[SPEAKER_21]: If you want to get something where you can play online, and you want to play against other people that live around, go for the Xbox.

1081
01:21:43,961 --> 01:21:49,864
[SPEAKER_21]: But here's the thing, you being the starving college student, that means you're going to have to pay for the Xbox, Xbox Live, and then five bucks a song pack.

1082
01:21:50,185 --> 01:21:50,545
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

1083
01:21:52,065 --> 01:21:52,387
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know.

1084
01:21:53,211 --> 01:21:56,187
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you looking... Yeah, but also with the PS2, I might have to mod it.

1085
01:21:56,980 --> 01:22:01,222
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to mod if I'm going to play 2DX or any of those lovely Pomani games besides DDR.

1086
01:22:01,322 --> 01:22:05,943
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, that's very true, and that's going to cost you money as well, I mean, if you want to play the Japanese games.

1087
01:22:06,303 --> 01:22:14,086
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's the other thing, if you plan on modding your PS2, which, you know, can have mixed results, I guess I hear now it's pretty easy to mod it.

1088
01:22:14,106 --> 01:22:15,146
[SPEAKER_02]: I live in the city.

1089
01:22:15,166 --> 01:22:15,967
[SPEAKER_02]: I live in the city.

1090
01:22:16,047 --> 01:22:18,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Chinatown's not that far, and I can always get it modded there.

1091
01:22:18,428 --> 01:22:18,948
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, alright.

1092
01:22:19,308 --> 01:22:19,688
[SPEAKER_21]: Fair enough.

1093
01:22:19,728 --> 01:22:20,868
[SPEAKER_21]: So you can get it modded PS2.

1094
01:22:20,908 --> 01:22:24,950
[SPEAKER_21]: So if you're interested in 2DX or Poppin' or any of that stuff, you're definitely going to want to get the PS2.

1095
01:22:26,286 --> 01:22:27,508
[SPEAKER_21]: Here's the other thing to consider, too.

1096
01:22:29,370 --> 01:22:34,277
[SPEAKER_21]: We have PS3 and Xbox 2 likely to be out in stores before next Christmas.

1097
01:22:34,297 --> 01:22:43,449
[SPEAKER_21]: We don't know for sure, but if I were a betting man, I would say those things are going to be in stores next Christmas, which means the systems that are out there now, their prices will be halved.

1098
01:22:44,522 --> 01:22:46,883
[SPEAKER_21]: or they'll be $100 or less.

1099
01:22:46,943 --> 01:22:50,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I probably already took notice of that.

1100
01:22:50,305 --> 01:22:58,969
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think 9th style, if it does come out next year for PS2, I don't know if it's going to jump into the next console or just be the last PS2 2DX game.

1101
01:22:59,169 --> 01:23:03,932
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm kind of hoping that there is a 9th style and a 10th style pretty back-to-back.

1102
01:23:04,012 --> 01:23:06,213
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm kind of hoping that those games come out pretty quickly.

1103
01:23:06,493 --> 01:23:10,295
[SPEAKER_02]: PS2 or just one for PS2 and the next for PS3.

1104
01:23:10,595 --> 01:23:11,636
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope they both come out.

1105
01:23:12,537 --> 01:23:18,993
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it's a given that PS3 will play PS2 games, so they ought to just both come out for PS2.

1106
01:23:19,966 --> 01:23:28,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, seeing as, you know, I already noticed that 2DX games come out, you know, there's always 2DX games coming out for PS2 every single year.

1107
01:23:29,352 --> 01:23:36,377
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically, from what I'm speculating, from what I'm predicting, Nightstar might come out in May next year or something, or near the summer.

1108
01:23:36,637 --> 01:23:37,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

1109
01:23:38,138 --> 01:23:38,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody really knows.

1110
01:23:38,799 --> 01:23:40,040
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just taking a guess here.

1111
01:23:40,060 --> 01:23:40,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, taking a shot.

1112
01:23:40,540 --> 01:23:41,821
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just taking an educated guess from...

1113
01:23:43,396 --> 01:23:46,999
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, alright, I think pretty much I... Well, you know what?

1114
01:23:47,539 --> 01:23:52,563
[SPEAKER_21]: Then again, 9th style would make a lot of sense on PlayStation 3 because then they could fuck up the timing.

1115
01:23:53,884 --> 01:23:57,306
[SPEAKER_21]: By putting it on a new system, just like the arcade one.

1116
01:23:57,907 --> 01:24:07,354
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I get a PS2 for Bomani, I'm gonna have to pay money for the 2DX controller, poppin' music, so it's gonna be equally the same if I'm gonna have to try going after both.

1117
01:24:08,186 --> 01:24:14,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Because one will have more peripherals and the other will have more services and things to buy.

1118
01:24:15,031 --> 01:24:21,175
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, also to even confuse things even more, there's also the Phantom console that's coming out.

1119
01:24:22,495 --> 01:24:23,256
[SPEAKER_20]: How is that confusing?

1120
01:24:23,456 --> 01:24:25,137
[SPEAKER_20]: Who gives a shit about the Phantom?

1121
01:24:25,237 --> 01:24:25,798
[SPEAKER_21]: Seriously.

1122
01:24:26,978 --> 01:24:27,479
[SPEAKER_21]: What's that?

1123
01:24:29,340 --> 01:24:29,920
[SPEAKER_21]: Exactly.

1124
01:24:30,140 --> 01:24:30,621
[SPEAKER_20]: Exactly.

1125
01:24:30,841 --> 01:24:33,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I've got pictures of the dough on orangeonradio.com.

1126
01:24:33,963 --> 01:24:34,603
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hear rumors of a...

1127
01:24:37,384 --> 01:24:38,986
[SPEAKER_20]: Engage 2 that's shaped like a banana.

1128
01:24:40,187 --> 01:24:40,808
[SPEAKER_20]: I have rumors.

1129
01:24:40,828 --> 01:24:42,730
[SPEAKER_21]: Better than a taco.

1130
01:24:43,010 --> 01:24:44,752
[SPEAKER_21]: I've heard rumors of a bowel movement.

1131
01:24:44,792 --> 01:24:46,554
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm about to have after this show.

1132
01:24:50,258 --> 01:24:50,979
[SPEAKER_21]: Here's the thing, though.

1133
01:24:51,039 --> 01:24:53,762
[SPEAKER_21]: If you're looking for Bimani, assistant for Bimani, don't get a GameCube.

1134
01:24:55,387 --> 01:25:10,016
[SPEAKER_02]: of course not, hell no, gamecubes are not worth the money hey, don't you be knocking the gamecube, it's a beautiful system I'm not knocking it, I mean, it's cheap, but I mean don't make me come out there and cut you, because I will what, you're going to travel 3,000 miles to cut you?

1135
01:25:10,277 --> 01:25:14,839
[SPEAKER_02]: to cut you, yes do you even know where in New York do I live?

1136
01:25:14,879 --> 01:25:20,183
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll send my minions yeah, sure, and do you want a cookie for that, Skye?

1137
01:25:21,814 --> 01:25:23,115
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

1138
01:25:23,616 --> 01:25:25,157
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1139
01:25:25,197 --> 01:25:27,259
[SPEAKER_21]: Live 365 has it all on record, I think.

1140
01:25:27,919 --> 01:25:28,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure it does.

1141
01:25:28,900 --> 01:25:32,223
[SPEAKER_02]: What IP and what school am I doing this from?

1142
01:25:32,423 --> 01:25:35,466
[SPEAKER_21]: You're going to the school of hang-up in about five seconds there, buddy.

1143
01:25:36,346 --> 01:25:36,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks a lot.

1144
01:25:37,047 --> 01:25:37,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks a lot, Sky.

1145
01:25:37,808 --> 01:25:38,308
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1146
01:25:38,348 --> 01:25:38,888
[SPEAKER_02]: You're welcome.

1147
01:25:39,969 --> 01:25:40,870
[SPEAKER_21]: Take care, Zaku.

1148
01:25:41,651 --> 01:25:41,971
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1149
01:25:41,991 --> 01:25:43,212
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I know what to choose later.

1150
01:25:48,696 --> 01:25:49,877
[SPEAKER_21]: Zaku's always fun to talk to.

1151
01:25:53,567 --> 01:25:55,008
[SPEAKER_21]: I like bullying him a little bit.

1152
01:25:55,088 --> 01:25:55,728
[SPEAKER_21]: He's fun.

1153
01:25:55,888 --> 01:25:56,428
[SPEAKER_21]: He's a fun guy.

1154
01:25:56,528 --> 01:25:56,808
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

1155
01:25:57,368 --> 01:25:59,609
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to go to the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.

1156
01:25:59,629 --> 01:26:00,429
[SPEAKER_21]: We've got to get into that.

1157
01:26:04,211 --> 01:26:13,654
[SPEAKER_21]: Last week in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, Loki was the winner, but it doesn't matter because that was a one-time thing, so...

1158
01:26:14,568 --> 01:26:17,269
[SPEAKER_21]: That gets thrown out and we go back to the cage match at hand.

1159
01:26:17,389 --> 01:26:20,649
[SPEAKER_21]: Our reoccurring winner, Gwen Stefani, What You Waiting For?

1160
01:26:20,729 --> 01:26:24,170
[SPEAKER_21]: It's the song I put in the cage match, believe it or not, three weeks ago.

1161
01:26:24,570 --> 01:26:29,112
[SPEAKER_21]: So because it won last week by default, this is the last time it can win.

1162
01:26:29,412 --> 01:26:33,793
[SPEAKER_21]: And if it wins tonight, it'll become the second song in Orange Lounge history to be retired from the cage match.

1163
01:26:34,353 --> 01:26:34,893
[SPEAKER_21]: So we'll see.

1164
01:26:36,353 --> 01:26:36,733
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll see.

1165
01:26:36,853 --> 01:26:38,474
[SPEAKER_21]: Loki seems convinced it's going to be gone.

1166
01:26:39,034 --> 01:26:41,354
[SPEAKER_21]: Jamie, you have something you want to say?

1167
01:26:42,135 --> 01:26:42,475
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1168
01:26:44,487 --> 01:26:45,007
[SPEAKER_21]: What a woman.

1169
01:26:47,528 --> 01:26:47,929
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

1170
01:26:48,969 --> 01:26:49,449
[SPEAKER_21]: Here we go.

1171
01:26:49,509 --> 01:26:50,750
[SPEAKER_21]: Here's a clip of last... Oh, yeah.

1172
01:26:50,770 --> 01:26:51,830
[SPEAKER_21]: The way the cage match works.

1173
01:26:52,110 --> 01:26:53,071
[SPEAKER_21]: You've got to be in our chat room.

1174
01:26:53,091 --> 01:26:54,792
[SPEAKER_21]: You've got to be listening live on Sunday night.

1175
01:26:55,032 --> 01:26:56,792
[SPEAKER_21]: www.orangellandradio.com.

1176
01:26:56,812 --> 01:26:57,413
[SPEAKER_21]: Click on chat.

1177
01:26:57,673 --> 01:26:59,374
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to play three songs for you guys.

1178
01:26:59,594 --> 01:27:00,834
[SPEAKER_21]: One song from each host.

1179
01:27:01,234 --> 01:27:06,276
[SPEAKER_21]: We only play a clip of last week's winner, though, because you already heard the song back when it first won.

1180
01:27:06,296 --> 01:27:08,417
[SPEAKER_21]: Because you listen to Orange Lounge Radio every week, right?

1181
01:27:08,437 --> 01:27:09,238
[SPEAKER_21]: Right?

1182
01:27:09,258 --> 01:27:09,578
[SPEAKER_21]: Right?

1183
01:27:10,908 --> 01:27:20,763
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway, then you're going to send in your vote and the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio 24-7 Balmati Music and More program.

1184
01:27:20,803 --> 01:27:21,404
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, here it is.

1185
01:27:21,564 --> 01:27:22,105
[SPEAKER_21]: Enough talking.

1186
01:27:22,445 --> 01:27:24,408
[SPEAKER_21]: A clip of song number one you can vote for tonight.

1187
01:27:24,709 --> 01:27:26,612
[SPEAKER_21]: Gwen Stefani, what you waiting for?

1188
01:27:54,315 --> 01:27:56,038
Thank you for watching!

1189
01:28:22,290 --> 01:28:23,371
Thank you for watching!

1190
01:29:05,450 --> 01:29:07,811
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, that was song number one in tonight's cage match.

1191
01:29:09,032 --> 01:29:10,772
[SPEAKER_21]: Gwen Stefani with Whatcha Waitin' For.

1192
01:29:10,812 --> 01:29:12,013
[SPEAKER_21]: What's so goddamn funny?

1193
01:29:12,673 --> 01:29:16,134
[SPEAKER_05]: Talking about combining different groups.

1194
01:29:16,174 --> 01:29:18,935
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got Britney Spears and Flo and then B4U.

1195
01:29:18,955 --> 01:29:19,616
[SPEAKER_05]: We have B4U.

1196
01:29:19,636 --> 01:29:22,637
[SPEAKER_21]: You guys are crazy.

1197
01:29:26,121 --> 01:29:29,102
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, let's get to song number two in tonight's Cage Match.

1198
01:29:29,142 --> 01:29:30,062
[SPEAKER_21]: Jamie, it's your pick.

1199
01:29:30,503 --> 01:29:35,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Mine's an apology for making everyone listen to that bad remix of Emerge.

1200
01:29:36,445 --> 01:29:40,828
[SPEAKER_05]: So I put in the original instead, just because I really wanted to play it and I don't care if it wins or not.

1201
01:29:41,328 --> 01:29:41,668
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

1202
01:29:41,968 --> 01:29:46,890
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the last one I did was Ersatz, so this is Fisher Spooner with Emerge.

1203
01:29:47,090 --> 01:29:49,892
[SPEAKER_21]: Fisher Spooner with Emerge, the non-remixed version.

1204
01:29:49,912 --> 01:29:52,213
[SPEAKER_21]: I was going to say, I thought you had a Fisher Spooner song in before.

1205
01:29:52,233 --> 01:29:53,574
[SPEAKER_07]: I did Ersatz before.

1206
01:29:53,594 --> 01:29:54,254
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

1207
01:29:55,896 --> 01:29:56,997
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, well, here it is, you guys.

1208
01:29:57,037 --> 01:29:59,698
[SPEAKER_21]: Song number two you can vote for tonight, Fischer Spooner, Emerge.

1209
01:30:00,218 --> 01:30:00,638
[SPEAKER_21]: Enjoy.

1210
01:30:26,797 --> 01:30:28,399
Thanks for watching!

1211
01:30:54,821 --> 01:30:54,981
Hi.

1212
01:30:55,041 --> 01:30:55,181
Hi.

1213
01:30:55,221 --> 01:30:55,301
Hi.

1214
01:31:17,506 --> 01:31:21,007
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't need to be much from nothing You don't need to step up

1215
01:31:51,930 --> 01:31:56,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Looks good, sounds good, looks good, feels good too, feels good too, feels good too

1216
01:32:12,626 --> 01:32:13,226
Thanks for watching!

1217
01:33:01,069 --> 01:33:01,374
[SPEAKER_08]: DaDaDa

1218
01:33:32,205 --> 01:33:33,527
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh-huh, that's right

1219
01:34:29,437 --> 01:34:31,419
Hi, that was song number two in tonight's case match.

1220
01:34:55,578 --> 01:34:56,779
[SPEAKER_21]: Fisherspooner with Emerge.

1221
01:34:56,919 --> 01:35:02,662
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's go around and get everybody's emerging thoughts on that song, starting off with the lovely DarkSakura.

1222
01:35:03,983 --> 01:35:07,305
[SPEAKER_13]: I always like that song, so it gets a 9 from me, but I don't really care.

1223
01:35:08,526 --> 01:35:10,587
[SPEAKER_21]: An apathetic 9 from DarkSakura.

1224
01:35:10,987 --> 01:35:13,389
[SPEAKER_13]: Seriously, I just put it in just because I wanted to listen to it.

1225
01:35:14,537 --> 01:35:15,838
[SPEAKER_21]: That's a good enough reason to send me.

1226
01:35:16,699 --> 01:35:18,480
[SPEAKER_21]: Arcadian, see if that mic will work again for you.

1227
01:35:20,362 --> 01:35:20,662
[SPEAKER_21]: No.

1228
01:35:20,902 --> 01:35:21,523
[SPEAKER_21]: Is it on?

1229
01:35:21,603 --> 01:35:21,903
[SPEAKER_21]: There we go.

1230
01:35:21,943 --> 01:35:22,544
[SPEAKER_21]: Is it okay?

1231
01:35:22,764 --> 01:35:22,964
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1232
01:35:24,926 --> 01:35:25,406
[SPEAKER_18]: It's alright.

1233
01:35:25,486 --> 01:35:28,349
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I don't really like it all that much, so I'll give it a six.

1234
01:35:28,769 --> 01:35:30,030
[SPEAKER_21]: A six from Arcadian.

1235
01:35:30,430 --> 01:35:30,711
[SPEAKER_21]: Loki!

1236
01:35:32,913 --> 01:35:33,533
[SPEAKER_20]: I didn't get it.

1237
01:35:34,834 --> 01:35:35,655
[SPEAKER_20]: Was that supposed to be a song?

1238
01:35:35,995 --> 01:35:40,059
[SPEAKER_20]: Because it sounded just like some stupid synth in the background and them talking over it.

1239
01:35:42,220 --> 01:35:42,761
[SPEAKER_20]: So I don't get it.

1240
01:35:43,632 --> 01:35:45,993
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm trying to go, it sounds like a Beck's type thing, but no.

1241
01:35:47,354 --> 01:35:47,574
[SPEAKER_20]: No.

1242
01:35:48,475 --> 01:35:51,077
[SPEAKER_20]: I can't imagine this being actually better than the original remix.

1243
01:35:51,697 --> 01:35:56,160
[SPEAKER_20]: Of course, I don't remember that remix of it, so, um, I get the one.

1244
01:35:56,440 --> 01:35:56,660
[SPEAKER_20]: Sorry.

1245
01:35:58,969 --> 01:35:59,249
[SPEAKER_21]: You know what?

1246
01:35:59,350 --> 01:36:01,431
[SPEAKER_21]: I actually dig the synths in that song quite a bit.

1247
01:36:01,511 --> 01:36:05,514
[SPEAKER_21]: I see that as kind of like maybe a song I would listen to while I'm driving home late at night.

1248
01:36:06,335 --> 01:36:09,037
[SPEAKER_21]: It's pretty cool and it's got very much of an 80s vibe going for me.

1249
01:36:09,477 --> 01:36:11,679
[SPEAKER_21]: My only complaint is that it's a little quiet.

1250
01:36:11,779 --> 01:36:13,580
[SPEAKER_21]: I'd like something maybe a little bit more driving.

1251
01:36:13,980 --> 01:36:15,942
[SPEAKER_21]: But I actually like the synths.

1252
01:36:15,982 --> 01:36:17,863
[SPEAKER_21]: I've become a total synth pop whore lately.

1253
01:36:18,203 --> 01:36:20,025
[SPEAKER_21]: And yes, a lot of that has to do with Ultramix too.

1254
01:36:20,405 --> 01:36:21,746
[SPEAKER_21]: So that song kind of fits in for me.

1255
01:36:21,806 --> 01:36:22,727
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm giving it an 8.

1256
01:36:22,907 --> 01:36:23,067
[SPEAKER_21]: Angel!

1257
01:36:24,168 --> 01:36:24,368
[SPEAKER_21]: Angel!

1258
01:36:26,632 --> 01:36:27,532
[SPEAKER_04]: I liked it a lot.

1259
01:36:28,233 --> 01:36:29,133
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give it an 8.

1260
01:36:31,093 --> 01:36:33,234
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, remember, it doesn't matter what we think, though.

1261
01:36:33,274 --> 01:36:34,774
[SPEAKER_21]: It's all up to you guys.

1262
01:36:34,874 --> 01:36:36,815
[SPEAKER_21]: But you get a third song to pick from tonight.

1263
01:36:37,475 --> 01:36:39,195
[SPEAKER_21]: And Loki is being cheap tonight.

1264
01:36:39,255 --> 01:36:40,415
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's hear what he's going to pick.

1265
01:36:41,836 --> 01:36:43,136
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you for the introduction.

1266
01:36:43,736 --> 01:36:47,877
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, this song, as we already heard, it was last week we played it.

1267
01:36:48,397 --> 01:36:50,978
[SPEAKER_20]: This is their cover of The Fix.

1268

[SPEAKER_20]: Midi Head with Deeper and Deeper.

01:36:54,679 --> 01:36:55,599
[SPEAKER_20]: Or Monolithic, whatever.

1270
01:36:56,763 --> 01:36:58,427
[SPEAKER_21]: Actually, it's Monolithic, but yeah.

1271
01:36:58,767 --> 01:37:05,122
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, so here it is, song number three tonight, a cover of The Fix with Monolithic with Deeper and Deeper.

1272
01:37:05,262 --> 01:37:06,004
[SPEAKER_21]: Enjoy, we'll be back.

We're gonna take the call and get deeper, and deeper, and deeper We're gonna take the call and get deeper, and deeper, and deeper

1274
01:39:03,149 --> 01:39:12,434

1275
01:39:51,013 --> 01:39:51,640
Thank you for watching!

1276
01:40:37,880 --> 01:40:46,985
And I see the edge, I look, I fall And I get deeper, and deeper The more I see, the more I fall Nobody's eyes, you better take the call I get deeper

1277
01:41:34,643 --> 01:41:40,387
[SPEAKER_21]: Song number three in tonight's cage match, Monolithic doing a cover of The Fix there, deeper and deeper.

1278
01:41:41,601 --> 01:41:45,804
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's go deep into our... I can't make a reference.

1279
01:41:45,844 --> 01:41:47,845
[SPEAKER_21]: Jamie, what did you think?

1280
01:41:48,725 --> 01:41:51,507
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked everything about the song except for the guy's voice.

1281
01:41:52,888 --> 01:41:59,232
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it gets... Well, damn, the music gets a 10, the voice gets a 1.

1282
01:42:00,793 --> 01:42:05,876
[SPEAKER_21]: So... Loki says it gets an 11.

1283
01:42:07,683 --> 01:42:08,064
[SPEAKER_07]: Seven.

1284
01:42:08,644 --> 01:42:09,124
[SPEAKER_21]: Seven, alright.

1285
01:42:09,144 --> 01:42:09,965
[SPEAKER_21]: Only because of the voice.

1286
01:42:10,606 --> 01:42:10,866
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright.

1287
01:42:11,507 --> 01:42:11,827
[SPEAKER_21]: Bradley.

1288
01:42:12,888 --> 01:42:13,468
[SPEAKER_18]: Can you hear me?

1289
01:42:14,089 --> 01:42:14,709
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, I can hear you.

1290
01:42:15,070 --> 01:42:16,111
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I thought it was pretty cool.

1291
01:42:16,171 --> 01:42:16,751
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll give it a nine.

1292
01:42:17,352 --> 01:42:18,433
[SPEAKER_21]: A nine from Bradley.

1293
01:42:18,853 --> 01:42:19,153
[SPEAKER_21]: Loki!

1294
01:42:21,615 --> 01:42:22,276
[SPEAKER_20]: It gets a ten.

1295
01:42:22,696 --> 01:42:28,742
[SPEAKER_20]: And, if you like this, go to midihead.com, buy his albums, and then tell him that Orange Lounge Radio sent you.

1296
01:42:29,002 --> 01:42:32,505
[SPEAKER_20]: You'll get access to this wonderful song, as well as many other remixes he's done.

1297
01:42:34,549 --> 01:42:41,915
[SPEAKER_21]: I've been listening to that song quite a bit on my new iPod lately, so I have to admit, it's actually a really good song.

1298
01:42:42,916 --> 01:42:47,699
[SPEAKER_21]: I just hope we don't, he doesn't turn into the new Echo Image on this station, seriously.

1299
01:42:50,361 --> 01:42:53,924
[SPEAKER_21]: No, but actually it's a great song, it's a great cover, and I like it.

1300
01:42:54,044 --> 01:42:55,285
[SPEAKER_21]: Nine, Angel.

1301
01:42:57,587 --> 01:43:03,031
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it a lot, good cover, and good artist, so you know what, nine and a half.

1302
01:43:04,591 --> 01:43:04,871
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

1303
01:43:05,633 --> 01:43:08,637
[SPEAKER_21]: An explicit who just walked in doesn't get to vote because he didn't hear that song.

1304
01:43:09,859 --> 01:43:10,179
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

1305
01:43:11,381 --> 01:43:12,102
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, guys.

1306
01:43:12,182 --> 01:43:13,864
[SPEAKER_21]: You're going to place your vote momentarily.

1307
01:43:13,904 --> 01:43:17,690
[SPEAKER_21]: But first, here is a recap of the three songs you can vote for tonight.

1308
01:43:17,770 --> 01:43:20,414
[SPEAKER_21]: Song number one you can vote for tonight, Gwen Stefani, What You Waiting For.

1309
01:43:29,389 --> 01:43:33,791
[SPEAKER_21]: Song number two you can vote for tonight is Fisher Spooner with Emerge.

1310
01:43:34,012 --> 01:43:38,854
[SPEAKER_21]: And song number three you can vote for tonight is Monolithic doing a cover of The Fix, Deeper and Deeper.

1311
01:44:08,263 --> 01:44:11,208
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, place vote now.

1312
01:44:11,348 --> 01:44:15,014
[SPEAKER_21]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.

1313
01:44:18,299 --> 01:44:19,120
[SPEAKER_21]: And we will see what happens.

1314
01:44:19,861 --> 01:44:22,025
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, moving right along.

1315
01:44:24,045 --> 01:44:28,927
[SPEAKER_21]: I've been perusing some of the message forums out there lately, DDR Freak namely being one of them.

1316
01:44:29,307 --> 01:44:32,868
[SPEAKER_21]: I thought there was this very interesting thread over there in Random Chat.

1317
01:44:32,888 --> 01:44:35,709
[SPEAKER_21]: You know how they do a lot of really crazy stuff over in Random Chat?

1318
01:44:36,029 --> 01:44:37,529
[SPEAKER_21]: You know the Random Chat stuff, right?

1319
01:44:37,809 --> 01:44:38,830
[SPEAKER_21]: Right, DarkSakura?

1320
01:44:39,310 --> 01:44:40,390
[SPEAKER_21]: Being a mod over there and everything?

1321
01:44:42,831 --> 01:44:43,071
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

1322
01:44:43,632 --> 01:44:45,893
[SPEAKER_20]: What's this random that you talk about?

1323
01:44:45,913 --> 01:44:48,875
[SPEAKER_21]: We don't know anything about random on this show.

1324
01:44:49,935 --> 01:45:01,022
[SPEAKER_21]: Just out of curiosity, this is total tangent, but since I'm thinking DarkSakura here and how much she loves to lock topics over there, what would you say would be the most favorite topic you've gotten to lock on random chat?

1325
01:45:03,884 --> 01:45:05,024
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, please lock this.

1326
01:45:06,766 --> 01:45:07,066
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1327
01:45:08,787 --> 01:45:10,388
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had a please lock this before.

1328
01:45:13,717 --> 01:45:14,958
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, please lock this, alright.

1329
01:45:16,359 --> 01:45:18,880
[SPEAKER_21]: There's an interesting topic going on there in random chat.

1330
01:45:18,900 --> 01:45:21,062
[SPEAKER_21]: It's called, do you actually play DDR anymore?

1331
01:45:21,702 --> 01:45:26,705
[SPEAKER_21]: And I thought it was kind of interesting just seeing how many people actually don't play DDR anymore.

1332
01:45:27,046 --> 01:45:32,529
[SPEAKER_21]: So I kind of was going to go around the room a little bit and see, do you play DDR anymore?

1333
01:45:33,470 --> 01:45:36,412
[SPEAKER_21]: And if not, why are you doing this show?

1334
01:45:38,891 --> 01:45:39,391
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll start.

1335
01:45:40,011 --> 01:45:41,032
[SPEAKER_21]: Do I play DDR anymore?

1336
01:45:41,152 --> 01:45:43,033
[SPEAKER_21]: A little bit, not as much nearly as I used to.

1337
01:45:43,253 --> 01:45:45,194
[SPEAKER_21]: I play a little bit of Ultramix 2 at home.

1338
01:45:45,734 --> 01:45:47,756
[SPEAKER_21]: Most of my DDR playing is Controller Controller.

1339
01:45:48,723 --> 01:45:53,546
[SPEAKER_21]: The reason why I don't play DDR that much anymore is because the quality of arcades in this area went downhill significantly.

1340
01:45:54,567 --> 01:45:58,290
[SPEAKER_21]: Konami of Japan can suck it for not putting out a new mix in a long time.

1341
01:45:58,330 --> 01:46:01,892
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that has a lot to do with the reason why I haven't played DDR in a long time.

1342
01:46:03,273 --> 01:46:10,278
[SPEAKER_21]: The home version is the only thing keeping it alive to me, but I just can't motivate my fat ass to pull out the ignition pad.

1343
01:46:10,778 --> 01:46:14,581
[SPEAKER_21]: Especially when the ignition pad, as good of a dance pad as it is, it's still not the arcade.

1344
01:46:15,081 --> 01:46:17,303
[SPEAKER_21]: I want to play DDR in the arcade, and there's no

1345
01:46:18,016 --> 01:46:20,177
[SPEAKER_21]: I played DDR when I was in Alabama.

1346
01:46:47,810 --> 01:46:48,391
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, there you go.

1347
01:46:48,951 --> 01:46:50,593
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you play it regularly besides that?

1348
01:46:50,853 --> 01:46:52,735
[SPEAKER_05]: When I'm somewhere that has a machine, I'll play.

1349
01:46:54,417 --> 01:46:57,541
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got more reason to play now than I play dock at RVGL.

1350
01:46:59,022 --> 01:47:00,865
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll set out a little bit of money and go play some DDR.

1351
01:47:01,693 --> 01:47:08,218
[SPEAKER_21]: I played like one game of DDR when I went to go play dock at Derby Owner's Club over at Roseville Golf Land, but here's the problem, I fucking failed Breakdown!

1352
01:47:08,398 --> 01:47:22,189
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, you know, it's a 9-footer, it's a more difficult song at the end of the scale, but you have to remember, I'm somebody who was playing DDR religiously for quite some time, and, you know, I... I just... It just makes me sad how much stamina I've lost, you know?

1353
01:47:23,470 --> 01:47:23,790
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright.

1354
01:47:24,151 --> 01:47:25,952
[SPEAKER_21]: Arkadian, do you actually play DDR anymore?

1355
01:47:27,645 --> 01:47:34,227
[SPEAKER_18]: Not really, mainly because my foot's been hurting, and I haven't had that much money lately.

1356
01:47:35,007 --> 01:47:40,249
[SPEAKER_18]: Now I might be able to go once my foot feels 100%, or 90% at least.

1357
01:47:41,390 --> 01:47:47,151
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe more in the future, because it's been so long and I need to get off my fat ass, and I sit around too much.

1358
01:47:48,712 --> 01:47:49,112
[SPEAKER_18]: And so on.

1359
01:47:50,873 --> 01:47:52,513
[SPEAKER_21]: Loki, do you play DDR anymore?

1360
01:47:53,614 --> 01:47:54,694
[SPEAKER_21]: DDR and Final Fantasy XI?

1361
01:47:57,865 --> 01:47:58,846
[SPEAKER_20]: Addict!

1362
01:48:00,107 --> 01:48:00,587
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, I do.

1363
01:48:00,767 --> 01:48:02,448
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm Step Mania every once in a while.

1364
01:48:02,629 --> 01:48:03,049
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll play it.

1365
01:48:04,990 --> 01:48:15,458
[SPEAKER_20]: But, yes, to answer your question earlier about Xbox and stuff and if I was ever going to play it, no, because I'm going to actually set up my Step Mania cabinet to be playing the stuff.

1366
01:48:15,498 --> 01:48:21,403
[SPEAKER_20]: In fact, that's why I bought crap today to cut the other control panel for the actual select arrows and stuff.

1367
01:48:22,043 --> 01:48:22,484
[SPEAKER_20]: That's why...

1368
01:48:23,806 --> 01:48:24,847
[SPEAKER_20]: I was going to do that today.

1369
01:48:24,887 --> 01:48:34,035
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm hopefully going to build that this week because I bought a while back a new IPAC thing to hook it all up and I have to see if it's going to get fried as easy as the other one.

1370
01:48:34,616 --> 01:48:39,260
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's all contingent on that, whether I get to play it some more.

1371
01:48:39,520 --> 01:48:49,329
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't play in the arcade because the arcade's too far away, takes too much of my time, cuts into my Final Fantasy XI time, and the arcade's broken all the time.

1372
01:48:49,529 --> 01:48:49,609
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm

1373
01:48:50,689 --> 01:48:51,989
[SPEAKER_20]: That and I'm way fucking out of shape.

1374
01:48:52,149 --> 01:48:55,110
[SPEAKER_20]: I go and play like a seven footer on doubles and I'm ready to die.

1375
01:48:55,831 --> 01:48:57,671
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, whatever happened to me.

1376
01:48:58,651 --> 01:48:59,372
[SPEAKER_20]: That's what I want to know.

1377
01:48:59,812 --> 01:49:00,752
[SPEAKER_20]: It never used to be this hard.

1378
01:49:01,352 --> 01:49:03,993
[SPEAKER_20]: But once I get back in shape, yeah, I'd play a lot more.

1379
01:49:04,033 --> 01:49:10,475
[SPEAKER_20]: I just need to finish my arcade cabinets before I move out of here, so that's priority one.

1380
01:49:13,300 --> 01:49:21,610
[SPEAKER_21]: You don't play a whole lot of DDR in the arcade or at home anymore, yet you're very gung-ho about this cabinet and everything.

1381
01:49:21,710 --> 01:49:22,551
[SPEAKER_21]: Why do you think that is?

1382
01:49:22,631 --> 01:49:25,855
[SPEAKER_21]: Is it just a love for the basic concept of the game?

1383
01:49:25,875 --> 01:49:28,618
[SPEAKER_20]: I like building stuff, have you noticed?

1384
01:49:28,918 --> 01:49:29,799
[SPEAKER_20]: Stuff that doesn't work.

1385
01:49:30,740 --> 01:49:31,842
[SPEAKER_20]: Like the portal to hell.

1386
01:49:32,062 --> 01:49:32,863
[SPEAKER_20]: The portal to hell.

1387
01:49:34,598 --> 01:49:45,966
[SPEAKER_21]: Also, I noticed you tend to build things halfway through and don't finish them, such as these lovely metal pads that have been sitting over here for the past... Can we play Xbox or PS2 games with them right now?

1388
01:49:47,426 --> 01:49:54,111
[SPEAKER_20]: We can if I hooked up the other, the, um, iPack thing, because all I have to do is switch out the old iPack and it plugs right in and it works.

1389
01:49:54,591 --> 01:50:03,717
[SPEAKER_20]: But the thing is, the thing is I haven't bought the adapter for the Xbox or the PS2 yet because it was hooking up directly to my computer.

1390
01:50:05,550 --> 01:50:06,191
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, I could.

1391
01:50:06,431 --> 01:50:07,492
[SPEAKER_20]: I could if I wanted to.

1392
01:50:07,572 --> 01:50:09,834
[SPEAKER_20]: It just would take a while because I'd have to wire everything.

1393
01:50:11,515 --> 01:50:17,360
[SPEAKER_21]: But it's just that those things... I would be curious how thick the layer of dust is on those metal pads that are sitting right there.

1394
01:50:18,461 --> 01:50:21,564
[SPEAKER_21]: Can I go wipe my finger on it and see how much dust is on them?

1395
01:50:23,465 --> 01:50:23,946
[SPEAKER_21]: Here you go, Loki.

1396
01:50:26,628 --> 01:50:29,070
[SPEAKER_20]: They also buy the air intake, just so you know.

1397
01:50:29,090 --> 01:50:32,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that.

1398
01:50:32,953 --> 01:50:33,474
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a little radio.

1399
01:50:35,123 --> 01:50:36,844
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh yeah, okay, I have an idea.

1400
01:50:37,105 --> 01:50:42,209
[SPEAKER_20]: Let me wipe the dust off of my little, my computer desk here, because I get quite a bit used to it.

1401
01:50:42,309 --> 01:50:43,030
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, look, it's gray.

1402
01:50:43,330 --> 01:50:46,592
[SPEAKER_20]: Let me wipe the dust off of every, there's dust everywhere in here.

1403
01:50:47,033 --> 01:50:49,315
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not a surprise that there's dust on those.

1404
01:50:50,876 --> 01:50:56,641
[SPEAKER_20]: That and they're right next to the air intake, which I'm sure is not good for the air conditioner one bit, but that's alright.

1405
01:50:58,622 --> 01:51:02,806
[SPEAKER_21]: No wonder it smells like wood in this house all the time, this strange mix of metal and everything.

1406
01:51:03,502 --> 01:51:05,243
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, uh, explicit.

1407
01:51:05,523 --> 01:51:06,523
[SPEAKER_21]: Welcome to the show, by the way.

1408
01:51:06,543 --> 01:51:07,684
[SPEAKER_21]: I noticed you just ran in there.

1409
01:51:08,004 --> 01:51:09,004
[SPEAKER_21]: Put down the DS for a minute.

1410
01:51:09,024 --> 01:51:10,645
[SPEAKER_21]: Quit chatting with Angel on Pickup Chat for a minute.

1411
01:51:11,305 --> 01:51:12,685
[SPEAKER_21]: That mic's been giving us... Yeah.

1412
01:51:13,226 --> 01:51:15,066
[SPEAKER_21]: They are like, what, eight feet?

1413
01:51:16,067 --> 01:51:16,767
[SPEAKER_20]: What the hell?

1414
01:51:17,127 --> 01:51:20,948
[SPEAKER_20]: This is what... I think they're exchanging special pictures.

1415
01:51:21,148 --> 01:51:22,249
[SPEAKER_20]: This is what's wrong, people.

1416
01:51:23,309 --> 01:51:24,450
[SPEAKER_20]: You need to talk.

1417
01:51:25,390 --> 01:51:26,270
[SPEAKER_20]: Talky-talky.

1418
01:51:26,610 --> 01:51:30,132
[SPEAKER_20]: It's like, you know, the people IMing each other when they're sitting in a cafe.

1419
01:51:30,532 --> 01:51:30,812
[SPEAKER_20]: Talk.

1420
01:51:32,148 --> 01:51:34,990
[SPEAKER_21]: They're writing penis back and forth to each other.

1421
01:51:35,110 --> 01:51:35,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, okay.

1422
01:51:36,411 --> 01:51:37,691
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Rob, that's you last night.

1423
01:51:37,731 --> 01:51:38,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you!

1424
01:51:38,492 --> 01:51:39,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1425
01:51:39,433 --> 01:51:42,014
[SPEAKER_21]: You gotta hold the mic at the bottom, because it's going out tonight.

1426
01:51:42,214 --> 01:51:43,235
[SPEAKER_21]: That mic's on its last legs.

1427
01:51:43,255 --> 01:51:43,855
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you hear me now?

1428
01:51:43,915 --> 01:51:44,736
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, I can hear you now.

1429
01:51:44,776 --> 01:51:45,456
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you play DDR?

1430
01:51:46,097 --> 01:51:52,621
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, since there's been tournaments and stuff, and some new people want me to come back again, I guess I'll play again.

1431
01:51:54,402 --> 01:52:00,986
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, even though the DDR scene is dying in a way, because there hasn't been any releases for the arcades and stuff, which is totally understandable.

1432
01:52:02,805 --> 01:52:08,766
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just the new people, the community, the new members are just trying to get, bring it back again in a way.

1433
01:52:09,207 --> 01:52:11,827
[SPEAKER_20]: You give me $100,000, I'll bring back DDR.

1434
01:52:12,247 --> 01:52:12,948
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm telling you.

1435
01:52:13,048 --> 01:52:16,568
[SPEAKER_11]: The only way that you can bring back DDR is by fixing the Stamina cabinet, damn it.

1436
01:52:17,069 --> 01:52:17,729
[SPEAKER_20]: Fuck that cabinet.

1437
01:52:18,149 --> 01:52:18,329
[SPEAKER_20]: Give me $100,000.

1438
01:52:18,369 --> 01:52:20,229
[SPEAKER_20]: Hell, give me just $20,000 and I'll bring it back.

1439
01:52:23,427 --> 01:52:29,950
[SPEAKER_21]: Don't you think that, now, call me crazy, because it's not supposed to be DDR, quote-unquote, but don't you think In The Groove was sort of a way to try to bring DDR back?

1440
01:52:30,530 --> 01:52:40,234
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I always got the impression of, was that In The Groove was, even though it's not DDR... Well, the thing about In The Groove is that not many cabinets have been sold around the U.S.

1441
01:52:40,294 --> 01:52:40,775
[SPEAKER_11]: just yet.

1442
01:52:41,875 --> 01:52:43,336
[SPEAKER_11]: And very few songs are in it.

1443
01:52:43,356 --> 01:52:46,757
[SPEAKER_11]: It's mainly just testing the waters until In The Groove 2 comes out and stuff.

1444
01:52:48,258 --> 01:52:53,020
[SPEAKER_11]: And it also depends on what step makers are they going to hire and what songs they're going to put in it.

1445
01:52:55,799 --> 01:52:59,942
[SPEAKER_11]: Hell, they put Ultramix, like, Ultramix in the DDR cam and I play it.

1446
01:53:01,443 --> 01:53:04,745
[SPEAKER_21]: I already, the first week after Ultramix 2 is out, I put the call out on the show.

1447
01:53:04,785 --> 01:53:08,688
[SPEAKER_21]: I said, we need to hound the shit out of Konami of Hawaii and however it has to happen.

1448
01:53:08,808 --> 01:53:12,971
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't care if some arcade division went under or what the shit happened.

1449
01:53:13,311 --> 01:53:14,672
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't care how it has to happen.

1450
01:53:14,832 --> 01:53:15,753
[SPEAKER_21]: It just needs to happen.

1451
01:53:16,033 --> 01:53:17,454
[SPEAKER_21]: Hawaii needs to make a new arcade mix.

1452
01:53:17,854 --> 01:53:18,394
[SPEAKER_21]: End of story.

1453
01:53:18,815 --> 01:53:21,476
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't care who's gotta be blown, who's gotta be paid the money.

1454
01:53:21,997 --> 01:53:22,797
[SPEAKER_21]: Make it happen!

1455
01:53:23,418 --> 01:53:25,019
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what's hella funny, though?

1456
01:53:25,666 --> 01:53:36,952
[SPEAKER_11]: The hell of companies are saying that the whole arcade business is dying unless you're trying to do this card system like Tekken 5 and Midnight Tuner or Initial D. Yeah, but the lines for Tekken 5?

1457
01:53:37,112 --> 01:53:37,532
[SPEAKER_21]: Insane.

1458
01:53:38,072 --> 01:53:38,432
[SPEAKER_21]: Honestly.

1459
01:53:38,772 --> 01:53:46,536
[SPEAKER_21]: You can't say Tekken 5 is not... I mean, despite how you feel about the Tekken series, it's, you know, the biggest crowd I've seen in an arcade in a long time.

1460
01:53:46,596 --> 01:53:47,377
[SPEAKER_07]: I have my card.

1461
01:53:49,678 --> 01:53:54,380
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, that's just like people saying, oh, well, you know, internet's killing the telephones.

1462
01:53:55,560 --> 01:53:58,062
[SPEAKER_20]: People still use the telephones just like people use the internet.

1463
01:53:58,482 --> 01:54:01,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, people still use the telephone and I talk to them.

1464
01:54:01,465 --> 01:54:01,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

1465
01:54:02,125 --> 01:54:08,611
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyways, but the whole thing is to convert, you know, Ultramix to an arcade system is like fucking easy.

1466
01:54:09,091 --> 01:54:11,293
[SPEAKER_20]: Minimal programming, licensing of songs.

1467
01:54:12,314 --> 01:54:13,054
[SPEAKER_20]: Build the hardware.

1468
01:54:13,215 --> 01:54:14,576
[SPEAKER_20]: Hardware is fucking easy to build.

1469
01:54:14,636 --> 01:54:16,057
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, come on.

1470
01:54:16,157 --> 01:54:16,958
[SPEAKER_20]: It's just an excuse.

1471
01:54:17,058 --> 01:54:18,839
[SPEAKER_20]: But it's just they don't want to do it.

1472
01:54:19,420 --> 01:54:20,420
[SPEAKER_20]: Because they don't want to distribute it.

1473
01:54:20,541 --> 01:54:21,041
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's a bitch.

1474
01:54:21,323 --> 01:54:25,736
[SPEAKER_11]: The reason why I pump it up is like making more and more money just building new machines and stuff

1475
01:54:28,012 --> 01:54:35,754
[SPEAKER_21]: Allow me to be the first to offer sex to anyone at Konami of Hawaii if you can make yourselves a new DDR game.

1476
01:54:36,215 --> 01:54:37,435
[SPEAKER_21]: You know what?

1477
01:54:38,115 --> 01:54:39,856
[SPEAKER_21]: Not the Konami of Japan does a bad job.

1478
01:54:39,896 --> 01:54:43,057
[SPEAKER_21]: So if they want to do a new mix, I'm perfectly fine with that as well.

1479
01:54:43,517 --> 01:54:48,638
[SPEAKER_21]: I will extend my sex offer to Konami of Tokyo as well, K-Set.

1480
01:54:49,179 --> 01:54:51,619
[SPEAKER_21]: So just make me a new DDR and I will put out.

1481
01:54:51,739 --> 01:54:52,340
[SPEAKER_21]: It's that simple.

1482
01:54:53,120 --> 01:54:56,561
[SPEAKER_21]: Anybody else care to offer their sexual favors?

1483
01:54:58,636 --> 01:55:00,618
[SPEAKER_20]: Thanks for watching!

1484
01:55:20,435 --> 01:55:23,017
[SPEAKER_21]: Because it's cheaper to license the songs of Japan, obviously.

1485
01:55:23,037 --> 01:55:29,803
[SPEAKER_20]: It's gonna look a little weird, but like, I made this machine over here in Japan, it's called a DDR Extreme USA.

1486
01:55:31,364 --> 01:55:40,532
[SPEAKER_21]: But it's not meant to be played in the United States, just... They could call it DDR Shit Mix, and I'd still play it.

1487
01:55:41,233 --> 01:55:42,194
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sorry, Shitake.

1488
01:55:43,094 --> 01:55:46,237
[SPEAKER_21]: They could call it DDR Shitake Mix, I would still play it.

1489
01:55:46,257 --> 01:55:47,118
[SPEAKER_11]: Shitake, that song.

1490
01:55:50,422 --> 01:55:53,263
[SPEAKER_21]: Angel, you still play DDR at all?

1491
01:55:53,683 --> 01:55:56,885
[SPEAKER_21]: You're probably more into DDR than anyone I know right now, so I have to ask you this.

1492
01:55:58,026 --> 01:55:58,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

1493
01:55:58,866 --> 01:56:05,389
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, I'm probably going to break down and get a dual-platform ignition because I want to play on Xbox Live.

1494
01:56:06,010 --> 01:56:06,170
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

1495
01:56:07,563 --> 01:56:14,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm looking into getting both of those this week, Ultramix 2 and the new pad.

1496
01:56:14,866 --> 01:56:18,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Magus is dying anyway, so I might as well just replace it.

1497
01:56:19,288 --> 01:56:20,629
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we can play doubles and stuff.

1498
01:56:21,009 --> 01:56:24,411
[SPEAKER_11]: Speaking of ignition, which is better, ignition or cobalt flux?

1499
01:56:25,952 --> 01:56:27,952
[SPEAKER_21]: I couldn't tell you because I haven't really played enough cobalt flux.

1500
01:56:27,992 --> 01:56:31,274
[SPEAKER_21]: I saw it a little bit at E3, but I wasn't familiar enough with it.

1501
01:56:31,783 --> 01:56:33,384
[SPEAKER_20]: They're both the same fucking pad.

1502
01:56:33,764 --> 01:56:35,664
[SPEAKER_20]: It's the same damn thing with a different logo on it.

1503
01:56:35,704 --> 01:56:36,304
[SPEAKER_20]: That's all it is.

1504
01:56:36,705 --> 01:56:37,725
[SPEAKER_20]: You can't get much different.

1505
01:56:38,025 --> 01:56:40,046
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, our medal is different than your medal.

1506
01:56:40,866 --> 01:56:44,447
[SPEAKER_11]: What about the quality and how many times could it be stepped?

1507
01:56:45,387 --> 01:56:46,268
[SPEAKER_20]: It doesn't matter.

1508
01:56:46,308 --> 01:56:47,428
[SPEAKER_20]: They're the fucking same.

1509
01:56:48,288 --> 01:56:51,510
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's call a pledge that not even a rhino could beat down the pad.

1510
01:56:51,810 --> 01:56:52,091
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh yeah!

1511
01:56:52,611 --> 01:56:54,192
[SPEAKER_20]: Do they have a rhino to test this?

1512
01:56:54,392 --> 01:56:57,894
[SPEAKER_20]: Did they take it to Africa and go, Hey rhino, step on the pad!

1513
01:56:58,114 --> 01:56:58,915
[SPEAKER_20]: How do you like it?

1514
01:56:59,415 --> 01:57:01,697
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, I'm sorry, but I can say, yeah, guess what?

1515
01:57:01,877 --> 01:57:03,798
[SPEAKER_20]: Jupiter has nothing on this pad!

1516
01:57:04,419 --> 01:57:06,060
[SPEAKER_20]: This pad can fuck up Jupiter!

1517
01:57:07,421 --> 01:57:10,162
[SPEAKER_20]: Seriously, they're just pulling the shit out of their ass, okay?

1518
01:57:10,242 --> 01:57:11,824
[SPEAKER_20]: A rhino can't fuck this up!

1519
01:57:12,004 --> 01:57:12,644
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, well, guess what?

1520
01:57:12,684 --> 01:57:15,166
[SPEAKER_20]: Bigfoot recommends, you know, red octane, so...

1521
01:57:15,726 --> 01:57:16,126
[SPEAKER_20]: Fuck that.

1522
01:57:17,787 --> 01:57:18,348
[SPEAKER_20]: It's stupid.

1523
01:57:18,548 --> 01:57:22,411
[SPEAKER_20]: Really, to be honest, when it comes down to pads, don't buy off the internet.

1524
01:57:23,011 --> 01:57:24,372
[SPEAKER_20]: Buy stuff that you can see in a store.

1525
01:57:24,392 --> 01:57:26,934
[SPEAKER_20]: Buy it like fries and stuff where you can actually see these pads.

1526
01:57:26,954 --> 01:57:34,919
[SPEAKER_20]: Because the shit you get off the internet, because I have bought metal pads off the internet, and I stepped on them and they bent.

1527
01:57:35,659 --> 01:57:36,700
[SPEAKER_20]: They bent downwards.

1528
01:57:37,201 --> 01:57:38,441
[SPEAKER_20]: And I was like, what the fuck?

1529
01:57:39,542 --> 01:57:40,283
[SPEAKER_20]: It was retarded.

1530
01:57:41,003 --> 01:57:43,645
[SPEAKER_20]: Pads are not meant to be folded in half.

1531
01:57:44,417 --> 01:57:48,499
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow, talk about how they say SUVs can bust them on their advertisements.

1532
01:57:48,959 --> 01:57:58,983
[SPEAKER_21]: Uh, our chat room over at www.orangeloungeradio.com, clicking on chat, uh, interesting point, there already is a DDR shit mix, and it's the Don't Fall Off mix, the DDR Extreme bootleg.

1533
01:57:59,423 --> 01:58:00,484
[SPEAKER_21]: You know the one that would speed up?

1534
01:58:00,664 --> 01:58:01,464
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, actually, there's two of them.

1535
01:58:01,484 --> 01:58:02,524
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I know about the speed up.

1536
01:58:02,644 --> 01:58:04,905
[SPEAKER_21]: The one that'll speed up, DDR Extreme Plus, thank you.

1537
01:58:05,025 --> 01:58:11,328
[SPEAKER_11]: There's the DDR, yeah, the one in Country Club Lane, speed up, ooh, let's speed up Max 300 and let's see if we can beat it at 360 BPM.

1538
01:58:11,348 --> 01:58:11,508
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, wow.

1539
01:58:14,851 --> 01:58:17,674
[SPEAKER_11]: or hear cartoon heroes in a very high-pitched voice.

1540
01:58:32,430 --> 01:58:34,152
[SPEAKER_21]: What is the deal with Cartoon Heroes?

1541
01:58:34,572 --> 01:58:41,597
[SPEAKER_21]: Why do so many people freaking love that song and are quick to label a mix as utter shit if that song isn't in it?

1542
01:58:42,097 --> 01:58:43,739
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't understand what is so great about the song.

1543
01:58:43,839 --> 01:58:44,499
[SPEAKER_21]: Is it a good song?

1544
01:58:44,779 --> 01:58:45,660
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, it's a great song.

1545
01:58:45,680 --> 01:58:46,861
[SPEAKER_21]: It was a little better when Aqua did it.

1546
01:58:47,161 --> 01:58:48,022
[SPEAKER_21]: But it's a good song.

1547
01:58:48,522 --> 01:58:49,363
[SPEAKER_21]: Is it fun to play?

1548
01:58:50,003 --> 01:58:50,584
[SPEAKER_21]: Kinda.

1549
01:58:50,724 --> 01:58:52,165
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, I'll die when I play it.

1550
01:58:52,605 --> 01:58:56,428
[SPEAKER_21]: But why do so many people freaking obsess over Cartoon Heroes?

1551
01:58:56,668 --> 01:58:59,910
[SPEAKER_21]: Like, do you know how many people threw a fit when that song wasn't in Extreme USA?

1552
01:58:59,930 --> 01:59:00,551
[SPEAKER_19]: I can answer that.

1553
01:59:02,125 --> 01:59:09,667
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's look back in DDR history and view what we call the songs that ruin mixes.

1554
01:59:10,207 --> 01:59:13,428
[SPEAKER_20]: Starting with third mix, Afronova.

1555
01:59:13,948 --> 01:59:19,089
[SPEAKER_20]: Who could love this wonderful African chant as you jump around like a complete nut?

1556
01:59:19,889 --> 01:59:25,391
[SPEAKER_20]: Fourth mix, Kick the Can, with its repetitive steps over and over and over again.

1557
01:59:26,171 --> 01:59:27,631
[SPEAKER_05]: There's another contributing factor.

1558
01:59:28,611 --> 01:59:27,631
1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 0, 7.

1559
01:59:33,238 --> 01:59:40,545
[SPEAKER_21]: You're forgetting though, my edit to Kick the Can, aka Big Cans, was awesome and made that song redeemable.

1560
01:59:42,307 --> 01:59:45,550
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, and as I would continue on to the fifth mix, Hot Limits.

1561
01:59:46,070 --> 01:59:49,834
[SPEAKER_20]: The song that just, you don't understand what they're saying, but you know it's very long.

1562
01:59:52,995 --> 01:59:55,637
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyways, DDR Max.

1563
01:59:55,837 --> 01:59:59,359
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd say probably that would be Exotic Ethnic.

1564
01:59:59,599 --> 02:00:01,601
[SPEAKER_20]: It was pretty repetitive in DDR Max.

1565
02:00:01,961 --> 02:00:03,041
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh no, Flash in the Night.

1566
02:00:03,242 --> 02:00:04,682
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, that was another one.

1567
02:00:04,763 --> 02:00:08,445
[SPEAKER_21]: Flash in the Night.

1568
02:00:08,585 --> 02:00:10,246
[SPEAKER_21]: Hold on, your mic's still cutting out a little bit.

1569
02:00:10,266 --> 02:00:12,007
[SPEAKER_11]: Hold it at the bottom.

1570
02:00:13,868 --> 02:00:14,249
[SPEAKER_21]: A little bit.

1571
02:00:14,309 --> 02:00:14,809
[SPEAKER_21]: Hold it at the bottom.

1572
02:00:15,925 --> 02:00:16,665
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, try it, try it.

1573
02:00:16,905 --> 02:00:17,526
[SPEAKER_11]: Put it close to your mouth.

1574
02:00:17,546 --> 02:00:17,866
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.

1575
02:00:18,006 --> 02:00:24,208
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the same reason why it's Cartoon Heroes got whored out, the same reason why So Deep is getting whored off with, like, DDR Max.

1576
02:00:24,468 --> 02:00:25,468
[SPEAKER_11]: Because it's like Hard As Hell 9.

1577
02:00:26,648 --> 02:00:32,510
[SPEAKER_21]: I would say, I would say the song that ruined DDR Max, even though I love this song, Cowgirl.

1578
02:00:33,471 --> 02:00:34,171
[SPEAKER_20]: Cowgirl, yes.

1579
02:00:35,051 --> 02:00:43,294
[SPEAKER_20]: Max 2, Cigaroo, and who could not forget the song that had everyone dancing, Blow My Whistle, Bitch.

1580
02:00:44,529 --> 02:00:45,249
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, God.

1581
02:00:45,429 --> 02:00:49,350
[SPEAKER_21]: Blow My Whistle Bitch definitely ruined Max 2.

1582
02:00:49,430 --> 02:00:51,451
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, so, make your point, please.

1583
02:00:52,351 --> 02:00:54,111
[SPEAKER_20]: My point is, I don't have a point.

1584
02:00:54,171 --> 02:01:01,333
[SPEAKER_20]: The point is that there's always going to be a song that people, that's catchy, and is annoying catchy.

1585
02:01:01,873 --> 02:01:07,354
[SPEAKER_20]: And to be honest, I hate cartoon heroes, and I know there's 50 bands out there that all sound like them.

1586
02:01:07,554 --> 02:01:10,495
[SPEAKER_20]: In fact, I hear different artists and I'm like, is that, you know, Aqua?

1587
02:01:10,855 --> 02:01:11,875
[SPEAKER_20]: No, it's not Aqua.

1588
02:01:11,975 --> 02:01:15,436
[SPEAKER_20]: It's Toybox or it's, you know, insert band here.

1589
02:01:15,796 --> 02:01:16,816
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, Captain Jack.

1590
02:01:16,936 --> 02:01:18,996
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, they sound all the fucking same.

1591
02:01:19,156 --> 02:01:21,797
[SPEAKER_20]: They have like the same singer that sings super high pitch.

1592
02:01:24,657 --> 02:01:29,238
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that it's a man who's been, you know... I think she's on smack.

1593
02:01:29,478 --> 02:01:30,459
[SPEAKER_20]: That's what's going on.

1594
02:01:30,479 --> 02:01:31,159
[SPEAKER_05]: She's on helium.

1595
02:01:32,539 --> 02:01:33,779
[SPEAKER_20]: She's fucking taking speed.

1596
02:01:33,799 --> 02:01:34,359
[SPEAKER_20]: She's on crack.

1597
02:01:34,680 --> 02:01:35,340
[SPEAKER_20]: Crystal meth.

1598
02:01:36,540 --> 02:01:36,880
[SPEAKER_20]: She's just

1599
02:01:37,645 --> 02:01:38,045
[SPEAKER_20]: It's awful.

1600
02:01:38,125 --> 02:01:41,107
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, so anyways, yeah, there's always going to be that annoying song.

1601
02:01:42,828 --> 02:01:43,169
[SPEAKER_20]: That's all.

1602
02:01:44,069 --> 02:01:48,832
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, there's always an annoying song that's annoying as well.

1603
02:01:48,852 --> 02:01:50,093
[SPEAKER_11]: What the shit is this?

1604
02:01:52,054 --> 02:01:57,718
[SPEAKER_20]: It's annoying when it was originally... Have you seen the video for this?

1605
02:01:57,958 --> 02:02:00,039
[SPEAKER_20]: The video for this is fucking annoying, okay?

1606
02:02:00,579 --> 02:02:01,820
[SPEAKER_20]: Honestly, it's just like...

1607
02:02:03,447 --> 02:02:13,516
[SPEAKER_21]: You're confusing the original, there was no video to that, but you're confusing the original Aqua song, which is a little, it's a little bit slower, even though it sounds very similar, it's a little bit slower.

1608
02:02:14,136 --> 02:02:23,945
[SPEAKER_21]: Pretty much, okay, take the original Cartoon Heroes by Aqua and play it on DDR Extreme Plus with the plus 20% modifier and that's what you get.

1609
02:02:23,965 --> 02:02:25,806
[SPEAKER_11]: It's awful.

1610
02:02:26,167 --> 02:02:26,567
[SPEAKER_20]: It's awful.

1611
02:02:26,987 --> 02:02:27,488
[SPEAKER_11]: It's awful.

1612
02:02:28,402 --> 02:02:33,327
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyways, yeah, they should have Extreme++, which, like, you know, speeds it up by 100% or something like that.

1613
02:02:34,568 --> 02:02:35,809
[SPEAKER_11]: 100%, okay, max 600.

1614
02:02:37,311 --> 02:02:39,693
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyways.

1615
02:02:40,013 --> 02:02:41,114
[SPEAKER_21]: 1, 2, 3, 4, max 300.

1616
02:02:41,154 --> 02:02:46,139
[SPEAKER_21]: Then we have songs that ruin the remix scene, but we'll do that another day.

1617
02:02:47,641 --> 02:02:47,881
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway.

1618
02:02:48,101 --> 02:02:48,442
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, no.

1619
02:02:49,565 --> 02:02:56,609
[SPEAKER_21]: Speaking of songs that ruin DDR, I wanted to have an old school flashback and start it off with an old favorite song of mine.

1620
02:02:57,110 --> 02:02:57,850
[SPEAKER_21]: Love this song.

1621
02:02:58,110 --> 02:03:01,973
[SPEAKER_21]: Jamie was dying to hear some second mix songs that are actually good songs, so we're going to put those in.

1622
02:03:02,353 --> 02:03:03,253
[SPEAKER_21]: So we're going to play those songs.

1623
02:03:03,493 --> 02:03:06,115
[SPEAKER_21]: But we have to start it off with a song I've been threatening all night long.

1624
02:03:06,155 --> 02:03:09,257
[SPEAKER_21]: It is the most old school of old school DDR songs.

1625
02:03:09,837 --> 02:03:15,821
[SPEAKER_21]: Please take a minute, despite how you feel about this song, this one goes out to the one and only...

1626
02:03:17,233 --> 02:03:20,256
[SPEAKER_20]: God bless his soul, he's not listening to us right now because he's out there.

1627
02:03:21,096 --> 02:03:21,657
[SPEAKER_20]: Kyle Snyder.

1628
02:03:22,317 --> 02:03:24,599
[SPEAKER_20]: God bless Kyle Snyder, seriously.

1629
02:03:25,040 --> 02:03:31,545
[SPEAKER_21]: But honestly, this, despite how you feel about this song, respect for a moment, please.

1630
02:03:32,106 --> 02:03:33,487
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll be back here on Orange Lodge Radio.

1631
02:03:34,788 --> 02:03:38,031
Ay-yi-yi, ay-yi-yi, ay-yi-yi.

1632
02:05:48,271 --> 02:05:49,591
Thanks for watching!

1633
02:06:51,121 --> 02:06:58,008
[SPEAKER_08]: Boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob.

1634
02:07:14,395 --> 02:07:33,214
[SPEAKER_08]: Y-I-I-I-I, you keep a focus through the green, green door I love you boy, it's your time You're very hard, you look like a young fella Take me overnight Boom, boom, boom, boom, something like a boom, boom Boom, boom, boom, boom, back to the water

1635
02:07:44,298 --> 02:07:45,181
Thank you for watching!

1636
02:09:30,322 --> 02:09:35,948
[SPEAKER_16]: Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song, Orange Lounge Radio.

1637
02:09:40,292 --> 02:09:44,176
[SPEAKER_21]: We are back, hi, on Orange Lounge Radio.

1638
02:09:44,256 --> 02:09:45,397
[SPEAKER_21]: We are such nerds.

1639
02:09:45,437 --> 02:09:48,019
[SPEAKER_21]: I was sitting there chatting on my DS with everyone else during the break.

1640
02:09:48,039 --> 02:09:51,303
[SPEAKER_21]: We have four DSs in this house right now.

1641
02:09:51,363 --> 02:09:53,565
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that we have five, but I'm not breaking mine out.

1642
02:09:55,470 --> 02:09:55,790
[SPEAKER_21]: I know.

1643
02:09:55,830 --> 02:09:56,390
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, that's right.

1644
02:09:56,410 --> 02:09:57,811
[SPEAKER_21]: You got your DS here too, Jamie.

1645
02:09:57,831 --> 02:09:59,011
[SPEAKER_21]: We could just have a DS chat.

1646
02:09:59,231 --> 02:10:01,052
[SPEAKER_21]: I was trying to put some pictures there on the webcam.

1647
02:10:01,312 --> 02:10:04,994
[SPEAKER_21]: I wrote penis, really dark, so you guys could see it, and then put it in the chat room.

1648
02:10:05,014 --> 02:10:06,154
[SPEAKER_21]: Who's calling me during the show?

1649
02:10:07,855 --> 02:10:08,835
[SPEAKER_21]: These people should know better.

1650
02:10:10,116 --> 02:10:11,176
[SPEAKER_21]: Especially this person.

1651
02:10:11,776 --> 02:10:12,136
[SPEAKER_21]: Shame.

1652
02:10:14,097 --> 02:10:16,198
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright.

1653
02:10:17,418 --> 02:10:24,621
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm just waiting for the emulator to work with Bluetooth, and then we'll get a wireless router so we can upload them all to a streaming chat room.

1654
02:10:25,782 --> 02:10:26,582
[SPEAKER_20]: That's the dream.

1655
02:10:29,723 --> 02:10:36,405
[SPEAKER_21]: And, oh god, for the person who requested Butterfly Pikachu Mix in the chat, no!

1656
02:10:37,066 --> 02:10:37,406
[SPEAKER_21]: Heck no.

1657
02:10:37,446 --> 02:10:38,426
[SPEAKER_21]: Although I do have that.

1658
02:10:38,506 --> 02:10:38,966
[SPEAKER_21]: I do have that.

1659
02:10:39,006 --> 02:10:39,807
[SPEAKER_21]: No, I'm not going to fire them.

1660
02:10:41,947 --> 02:10:44,428
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, who wants to hear who won the cage match tonight?

1661
02:10:46,869 --> 02:10:50,290
[SPEAKER_21]: The winning song of tonight's cage match actually surprised me a little bit.

1662
02:10:50,690 --> 02:10:52,951
[SPEAKER_21]: It only won by two votes.

1663
02:10:53,894 --> 02:10:55,235
[SPEAKER_21]: Not one vote, but two votes.

1664
02:10:55,295 --> 02:10:56,876
[SPEAKER_21]: It all came down to two votes.

1665
02:10:57,336 --> 02:10:58,817
[SPEAKER_21]: The winning song of tonight's cage match.

1666
02:11:04,820 --> 02:11:07,242
[SPEAKER_21]: Believe it or not, it won.

1667
02:11:07,642 --> 02:11:08,442
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm actually surprised.

1668
02:11:08,483 --> 02:11:09,823
[SPEAKER_21]: I thought Monolithic had it sealed.

1669
02:11:09,883 --> 02:11:13,285
[SPEAKER_20]: Because she said it was going to be retired and they won another retired one.

1670
02:11:13,505 --> 02:11:14,586
[SPEAKER_21]: That's basically it.

1671
02:11:14,606 --> 02:11:18,328
[SPEAKER_21]: So Gwen Stefani is officially retired.

1672
02:11:18,388 --> 02:11:20,269
[SPEAKER_21]: It'll spend one more week in the spotlight.

1673
02:11:20,610 --> 02:11:22,911
[SPEAKER_21]: And then three brand new songs for you to listen to next week.

1674
02:11:25,507 --> 02:11:25,808
[SPEAKER_21]: What?

1675
02:11:26,488 --> 02:11:27,449
[SPEAKER_20]: As is her career.

1676
02:11:30,312 --> 02:11:30,712
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright.

1677
02:11:30,732 --> 02:11:43,004
[SPEAKER_21]: I was going to take another call over Skype, but I know that our chatters are kind of shy and probably wouldn't want to call in, so how about we get into the FUs of the week?

1678
02:11:43,064 --> 02:11:47,328
[SPEAKER_21]: I think now's a good time, especially after that victory, to get into the FUs of the week.

1679
02:11:47,348 --> 02:11:48,750
[SPEAKER_21]: Does that sound like a plan for you, Jamie?

1680
02:11:50,605 --> 02:11:56,130
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, and why is it, Miss Jamie, that we have to do the FUs of the Week every single week on this show?

1681
02:11:56,470 --> 02:11:57,892
[SPEAKER_07]: Because everything sucks.

1682
02:12:05,099 --> 02:12:06,040
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, this is bad.

1683
02:12:15,529 --> 02:12:20,010
[SPEAKER_05]: Big F you goes toward the stinky person on the plane who cut a big fart sitting in front of me.

1684
02:12:23,091 --> 02:12:34,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Another F you goes toward just general backwards ass shit, having no free time, and my weird grammatical errors, and the four bottles of Guinness I had last night, and that's really about it.

1685
02:12:36,315 --> 02:12:36,756
[SPEAKER_17]: That's it?

1686
02:12:37,996 --> 02:12:38,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1687
02:12:40,140 --> 02:12:49,685
[SPEAKER_05]: I want a big F you to my mom for saying that her chronic bronchitis is not aggravated by cigarette smoke.

1688
02:12:52,447 --> 02:12:53,307
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, you sure you're done?

1689
02:12:54,468 --> 02:12:54,808
[SPEAKER_21]: Are you sure?

1690
02:12:55,068 --> 02:12:55,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

1691
02:12:55,469 --> 02:12:55,809
[SPEAKER_21]: You sure?

1692
02:12:56,389 --> 02:12:56,549
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1693
02:12:56,950 --> 02:12:57,250
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright.

1694
02:12:58,270 --> 02:12:58,851
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, here we go.

1695
02:12:58,871 --> 02:12:59,451
[SPEAKER_21]: Loki, your turn.

1696
02:13:02,372 --> 02:13:04,314
[SPEAKER_20]: Fuck you, Folsom, on multiple occasions.

1697
02:13:05,174 --> 02:13:08,377
[SPEAKER_20]: Number one being, um, the lights.

1698
02:13:08,537 --> 02:13:12,040
[SPEAKER_20]: Literally, the lights, the stoplights around here are so short.

1699
02:13:12,540 --> 02:13:13,801
[SPEAKER_20]: I came to a stoplight.

1700
02:13:14,021 --> 02:13:24,530
[SPEAKER_20]: I saw it turn from green to red to yellow, um, you know, all the colors and everything in less than a second.

1701
02:13:24,550 --> 02:13:26,331
[SPEAKER_20]: I was like, what the fuck?

1702
02:13:26,591 --> 02:13:29,233
[SPEAKER_20]: There was not even enough time for one car to go through the light.

1703
02:13:30,474 --> 02:13:31,095
[SPEAKER_20]: It was ridiculous.

1704
02:13:32,799 --> 02:13:38,986
[SPEAKER_20]: Then, then, um, fuck you too, um, a giant marathon is out front of our fucking house!

1705
02:13:39,286 --> 02:13:40,248
[SPEAKER_20]: Giant marathon!

1706
02:13:40,348 --> 02:13:41,629
[SPEAKER_20]: Ah, shut up, you don't live around here.

1707
02:13:41,970 --> 02:13:42,470
[SPEAKER_20]: Doesn't matter.

1708
02:13:43,031 --> 02:13:50,079
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, you didn't have to hear at five in the fucking morning, wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-

1709
02:13:50,319 --> 02:13:53,360
[SPEAKER_20]: broadcasted over a giant loudspeaker out front.

1710
02:13:53,540 --> 02:13:59,001
[SPEAKER_20]: It was bad enough that they took up four of our parking spaces up close to our apartment with goddamn porta-potties.

1711
02:13:59,321 --> 02:14:00,602
[SPEAKER_20]: Four porta-potties, okay?

1712
02:14:00,962 --> 02:14:02,462
[SPEAKER_20]: Four porta-potties.

1713
02:14:02,742 --> 02:14:05,603
[SPEAKER_20]: Meanwhile, there's 50 porta-potties along the street.

1714
02:14:05,963 --> 02:14:09,984
[SPEAKER_20]: Why do you need four more strategically placed in those parking spaces?

1715
02:14:10,384 --> 02:14:12,165
[SPEAKER_20]: Along with some stupid food, okay?

1716
02:14:12,885 --> 02:14:16,766
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, I'm no genius here, but since the fucking, you know, damn road is closed...

1717
02:14:17,447 --> 02:14:24,416
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd say there's a pretty good chance you can probably put that booth right there next to all the goddamn fucking porta-potties.

1718
02:14:25,017 --> 02:14:27,500
[SPEAKER_20]: Wow, wouldn't that make sense?

1719
02:14:28,101 --> 02:14:31,486
[SPEAKER_20]: But no, so we have to make noise for three hours.

1720
02:14:32,167 --> 02:14:33,489
[SPEAKER_20]: Three hours in the morning.

1721
02:14:34,628 --> 02:14:45,092
[SPEAKER_20]: See, I was expecting not to hear the marathon, because last time I slept through it, but, you know, I got woken up, and my first, you know, things that came to my mind was, this is fucking ridiculous.

1722
02:14:45,892 --> 02:14:53,494
[SPEAKER_20]: And we went outside, and there's tons of runners, and trust me, if I'm outside... KCRA3 is protecting you with our live pinpoint doppler radar.

1723
02:14:53,794 --> 02:14:56,836
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't fucking care about your pinpoint doppler radar!

1724
02:14:58,136 --> 02:15:00,537
[SPEAKER_21]: I was trying to find a link to the chatroom...

1725
02:15:01,789 --> 02:15:03,650
[SPEAKER_21]: I was trying to find a link about the marathon.

1726
02:15:03,670 --> 02:15:10,292
[SPEAKER_21]: There was a story on a local news station I was going to send it to the... That's actually kind of funny now that I think about it.

1727
02:15:10,372 --> 02:15:10,632
[SPEAKER_21]: F.U.

1728
02:15:10,652 --> 02:15:11,212
[SPEAKER_21]: Channel 3.

1729
02:15:14,433 --> 02:15:18,735
[SPEAKER_20]: So anyway, yeah, that really sucks.

1730
02:15:20,015 --> 02:15:24,217
[SPEAKER_20]: Other than that, a premature... Oh, man.

1731
02:15:24,297 --> 02:15:26,758
[SPEAKER_20]: A premature fuck you to...

1732
02:15:28,581 --> 02:15:30,882
[SPEAKER_20]: My car that has to go in on Thursday.

1733
02:15:32,363 --> 02:15:38,365
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's going to suck because I know they're going to try to screw me out of my fucking warranty.

1734
02:15:39,105 --> 02:15:41,807
[SPEAKER_20]: But, you know, I won't let them because I know it's not my brakes.

1735
02:15:42,167 --> 02:15:44,007
[SPEAKER_20]: It's their fucking calipers that are broken.

1736
02:15:45,208 --> 02:15:47,729
[SPEAKER_20]: But I have to take off work on Tuesday to go to my grandma's funeral.

1737
02:15:48,289 --> 02:15:52,851
[SPEAKER_20]: And I have to take off work on, or I mean Tuesday for funeral, Thursday for my car.

1738
02:15:53,511 --> 02:15:54,872
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's going to be kind of a weird week.

1739
02:15:56,473 --> 02:15:57,013
[SPEAKER_20]: But, uh...

1740
02:15:57,472 --> 02:15:58,853
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I'm going to call in sick on Thursday.

1741
02:15:58,873 --> 02:15:59,534
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not going to tell them.

1742
02:16:01,335 --> 02:16:06,420
[SPEAKER_20]: And finally, just fucking retarded people that play Final Fantasy XI.

1743
02:16:06,560 --> 02:16:09,602
[SPEAKER_20]: I've never seen more unintelligent people in my entire life.

1744
02:16:09,923 --> 02:16:12,265
[SPEAKER_20]: People that misspell something and then misspell.

1745
02:16:12,565 --> 02:16:13,346
[SPEAKER_20]: Like, for instance...

1746
02:16:13,846 --> 02:16:20,612
[SPEAKER_20]: Please help me out, spell P-L-I first, and then they're all, oh, I'm sorry, I misspelled that.

1747
02:16:20,832 --> 02:16:22,213
[SPEAKER_20]: P-L-I-S.

1748
02:16:22,433 --> 02:16:22,834
[SPEAKER_20]: Please.

1749
02:16:23,174 --> 02:16:23,534
[SPEAKER_20]: Pliss.

1750
02:16:23,934 --> 02:16:24,815
[SPEAKER_20]: Pliss help me out.

1751
02:16:25,276 --> 02:16:27,037
[SPEAKER_21]: Welcome to Ragnarok, chat.

1752
02:16:27,097 --> 02:16:27,658
[SPEAKER_21]: My god.

1753
02:16:28,318 --> 02:16:30,019
[SPEAKER_21]: I would say Pliss learn how to spell.

1754
02:16:32,001 --> 02:16:34,503
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyways, I just hate people and their bad grammar.

1755
02:16:34,583 --> 02:16:38,947
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, honestly, I can understand shorthand, you know, using R and U as actual words.

1756
02:16:39,372 --> 02:16:39,632
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know.

1757
02:16:39,652 --> 02:16:39,812
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm done.

1758
02:17:05,769 --> 02:17:08,270
[SPEAKER_21]: F you to that marathon that was going on outside the house this morning.

1759
02:17:08,510 --> 02:17:12,112
[SPEAKER_21]: Seriously, you can go to any Sacramento-based website and read about this marathon.

1760
02:17:12,152 --> 02:17:13,433
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a huge event that happens every year.

1761
02:17:14,093 --> 02:17:16,834
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that's great if you want to do a marathon and what have you.

1762
02:17:17,154 --> 02:17:20,076
[SPEAKER_21]: But freaking shut up or start the thing after...

1763
02:17:20,936 --> 02:17:26,137
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, there's a noise ordinance in the city that says do not make noise until after 8 a.m.

1764
02:17:26,557 --> 02:17:29,438
[SPEAKER_21]: So, freaking turn your loudspeakers off until 8 a.m.

1765
02:17:29,638 --> 02:17:31,099
[SPEAKER_21]: Or, you know, it doesn't make sense to me.

1766
02:17:31,319 --> 02:17:35,160
[SPEAKER_21]: We live right behind a huge lake that is emptiness.

1767
02:17:35,460 --> 02:17:36,680
[SPEAKER_21]: There's nothing at the lake.

1768
02:17:37,520 --> 02:17:39,321
[SPEAKER_21]: Nobody goes to the lake in the wintertime.

1769
02:17:39,801 --> 02:17:43,602
[SPEAKER_21]: Start the marathon just like 300 feet away at the lake, okay?

1770
02:17:44,262 --> 02:17:46,603
[SPEAKER_21]: Honestly, it's a marathon.

1771
02:17:46,643 --> 02:17:47,623
[SPEAKER_21]: They can run a little further.

1772
02:17:48,757 --> 02:17:52,580
[SPEAKER_20]: But Rob, it's 9-11, and, you know, terrorists.

1773
02:17:53,681 --> 02:17:55,182
[SPEAKER_20]: But here's the thing I don't understand, okay?

1774
02:17:55,262 --> 02:18:02,348
[SPEAKER_20]: I can understand, okay, I would have not had a problem if the guy is just like, you know, okay, we're going to start the race at da-da-da-da time, you know, this kind of thing.

1775
02:18:02,708 --> 02:18:06,191
[SPEAKER_20]: And then at the time, you know, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, go, you know, like he did.

1776
02:18:06,451 --> 02:18:09,253
[SPEAKER_20]: But no, he had the, and the, blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah.

1777
02:18:09,413 --> 02:18:11,175
[SPEAKER_20]: He just talked for three hours straight.

1778
02:18:11,195 --> 02:18:11,715
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay?

1779
02:18:11,835 --> 02:18:21,342
[SPEAKER_20]: It's like, you know, I understand you have, you know, the PA and stuff to, you know, get a hold of, you know, attention of these people, but you don't need to fucking talk, like, all the time!

1780
02:18:21,903 --> 02:18:30,409
[SPEAKER_20]: Just say, okay, well, you know, announce, you know, 15 minutes before the race starts, you know, so you can get in your marks, you know, and then do the countdown, and that's it!

1781
02:18:30,610 --> 02:18:33,072
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, and then there's a fucking siren after that!

1782
02:18:33,272 --> 02:18:33,352
[SPEAKER_20]: Woo!

1783
02:18:35,513 --> 02:18:39,136
[SPEAKER_20]: Like, cause you didn't, you didn't see, oh, why are all those people running?

1784
02:18:40,077 --> 02:18:42,779
[SPEAKER_20]: One more thing I forgot to add, sorry, I'm stealing your thing.

1785
02:18:43,179 --> 02:18:46,062
[SPEAKER_20]: Fuck you, the police department here, because they were parked...

1786
02:18:46,638 --> 02:18:47,999
[SPEAKER_21]: No, I get this F you, okay?

1787
02:18:48,259 --> 02:18:58,606
[SPEAKER_21]: I get the F you to the police department because frickin' I called them at 6.30 in the morning saying, there is a marathon going on outside this house, I'm sure you're aware, but they are being way too loud.

1788
02:18:58,786 --> 02:19:01,748
[SPEAKER_21]: And she's like, sorry sir, there's nothing I can do about that.

1789
02:19:02,469 --> 02:19:06,411
[SPEAKER_21]: I said, are you aware that there's a city ordinance that says that you can't make noise before 8 a.m.?

1790
02:19:06,912 --> 02:19:10,414
[SPEAKER_21]: If you have an issue with that, you're going to have to call City Hall and request to the permits department.

1791
02:19:10,714 --> 02:19:15,539
[SPEAKER_21]: So now I'm going to have to look like a big grinchy asshole when the fact of the matter is I'm probably not even going to live here next year.

1792
02:19:15,780 --> 02:19:17,462
[SPEAKER_21]: But I am not going to let this shit slide.

1793
02:19:17,602 --> 02:19:23,388
[SPEAKER_21]: I am pissed that they woke me up at 6.30 on a freaking Sunday when I was out drinking the night before.

1794
02:19:24,049 --> 02:19:24,249
[SPEAKER_21]: Ass!

1795
02:19:25,611 --> 02:19:26,552
[SPEAKER_20]: Sorry, Loki, you had a thought.

1796
02:19:28,069 --> 02:19:44,576
[SPEAKER_20]: My thought was because this police officer parked his car in the middle of the fucking lane, on the street, no reason, just sitting there with his flashers on, not blocking traffic because there was an accident, or he pulled someone over, or he was fiddling around with god knows what, he was parked in the middle of the fucking road!

1797
02:19:45,216 --> 02:19:45,997
[SPEAKER_20]: For no reason!

1798
02:19:47,337 --> 02:19:48,057
[SPEAKER_20]: So I went around him.

1799
02:19:49,498 --> 02:19:50,178
[SPEAKER_20]: On the inside.

1800
02:19:51,159 --> 02:19:54,200
[SPEAKER_20]: Except if there was a dead person there, I would have run him over.

1801
02:19:56,066 --> 02:20:19,217
[SPEAKER_21]: to be continued I am going to call and complain on Monday just you wait and I know the neighbors upstairs I'm proud of you I am taking lessons from Jamie I'm going to have her proofread my angry letter I'll do it too I'll make that stuff fit in it awesome you should sign it even though you don't live here alright let's go around and get some other folks in studio get their FUs of the week we'll start off with Angel um

1802
02:20:20,956 --> 02:20:26,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, just F you to, uh, yeah, I don't know.

1803
02:20:26,741 --> 02:20:27,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Shit.

1804
02:20:28,102 --> 02:20:29,303
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually don't really have one.

1805
02:20:29,643 --> 02:20:31,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, F you to my instructor because he's mad.

1806
02:20:32,245 --> 02:20:36,749
[SPEAKER_04]: But, uh, he's actually letting us out on the 8th or something like that.

1807
02:20:37,610 --> 02:20:41,132
[SPEAKER_04]: But, uh, we still gotta come back to the finals, so I don't know what's up with that.

1808
02:20:42,333 --> 02:20:42,694
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1809
02:20:42,734 --> 02:20:43,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

1810
02:20:44,915 --> 02:20:46,116
[SPEAKER_21]: Arcadian42, your FUs of the week.

1811
02:20:50,629 --> 02:20:52,570
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, make sure, you hear me, can you?

1812
02:20:52,850 --> 02:20:53,510
[SPEAKER_18]: I can hear you.

1813
02:20:53,771 --> 02:20:54,051
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1814
02:20:54,831 --> 02:21:05,956
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, fuck you to my skin, I don't know about the winter, it just makes my skin start getting all dry, and I just drink lots of water, but it still doesn't help.

1815
02:21:06,757 --> 02:21:07,537
[SPEAKER_18]: But, uh, anyway.

1816
02:21:08,358 --> 02:21:19,163
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, yeah, and, uh, Loki was talking about, uh, stupid, uh, traffic lights, there's one near my work that's stupid, that's, like, misprogrammed, that's, like,

1817
02:21:19,662 --> 02:21:24,585
[SPEAKER_18]: Changes in 5 seconds, after like 5 seconds from green to yellow.

1818
02:21:24,705 --> 02:21:30,769
[SPEAKER_18]: And some, like recently, they fucked up the timing so that this crossroad isn't getting all that much traffic.

1819
02:21:30,809 --> 02:21:34,912
[SPEAKER_18]: It's like, you sit there for a minute before it goes back to green.

1820
02:21:35,032 --> 02:21:36,233
[SPEAKER_18]: That's annoying.

1821
02:21:37,054 --> 02:21:39,115
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, and, uh, yeah.

1822
02:21:39,215 --> 02:21:44,739
[SPEAKER_18]: I get a laziness and so it's still hurting me from playing DDR or something.

1823
02:21:45,699 --> 02:21:46,200
[SPEAKER_18]: Laziness.

1824
02:21:46,340 --> 02:21:46,900
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, whatever.

1825
02:21:47,930 --> 02:21:48,270
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

1826
02:21:49,011 --> 02:21:49,612
[SPEAKER_21]: Explicit.

1827
02:21:50,412 --> 02:21:53,535
[SPEAKER_21]: And just so you know, I told the chat room they have to keep it short, so you do too.

1828
02:21:54,176 --> 02:21:57,398
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, the FU's already announced what the marathon is.

1829
02:21:57,539 --> 02:21:58,940
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, yeah, the marathon's, of course.

1830
02:21:59,160 --> 02:22:01,522
[SPEAKER_11]: Waking people, waking me up early in the morning.

1831
02:22:02,123 --> 02:22:04,325
[SPEAKER_11]: The fact that it got me 30 minutes late to work.

1832
02:22:05,726 --> 02:22:14,874
[SPEAKER_11]: And speaking of the marathon, I want to give an FU to some... I want to give an FU to some little, some teenager...

1833
02:22:15,683 --> 02:22:20,264
[SPEAKER_11]: I have something to say about that but I'll wait till later.

1834
02:22:20,344 --> 02:22:21,984
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you can say it now.

1835
02:22:43,866 --> 02:22:46,306
[SPEAKER_21]: Everybody knows that girls and gays have no place in DDR.

1836
02:22:47,847 --> 02:22:49,287
[SPEAKER_11]: I was not going to say that by just saying.

1837
02:22:49,387 --> 02:22:54,528
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, two-thirds of this show is comprised of girls and gays, so I would watch a little mouth there.

1838
02:22:55,688 --> 02:22:58,109
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I'm just saying, it's just DDR.

1839
02:22:58,549 --> 02:23:00,189
[SPEAKER_11]: There's nothing special about it.

1840
02:23:00,209 --> 02:23:05,250
[SPEAKER_11]: Some people take it way too seriously in the forums.

1841
02:23:08,631 --> 02:23:09,251
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, is that it?

1842
02:23:12,226 --> 02:23:15,027
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, FU2, upcoming finals coming up soon.

1843
02:23:15,668 --> 02:23:21,771
[SPEAKER_11]: FU2 for not being able to spend money for freaking Christmas because I have to spend some money on bills and stuff.

1844
02:23:23,671 --> 02:23:24,632
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's about it for now.

1845
02:23:25,080 --> 02:23:26,540
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, let's get to the chatroom FUs.

1846
02:23:26,560 --> 02:23:28,441
[SPEAKER_21]: They're mad at me because I told them they had to keep it short tonight.

1847
02:23:28,461 --> 02:23:28,901
[SPEAKER_21]: They don't like that.

1848
02:23:28,921 --> 02:23:31,362
[SPEAKER_21]: But seriously, we've got like 20 people that send FUs in tonight.

1849
02:23:31,402 --> 02:23:31,762
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a lot.

1850
02:23:31,782 --> 02:23:33,002
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to go ahead and read one, though.

1851
02:23:33,102 --> 02:23:35,123
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, Jamie has one she wants to read first.

1852
02:23:35,343 --> 02:23:39,705
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I'm actually on AAM right now, and I'm not telling anybody what name I'm on.

1853
02:23:41,185 --> 02:23:44,246
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a FU from Vogue Obscurity.

1854
02:23:46,026 --> 02:23:50,948
[SPEAKER_05]: A big FU to our roommate M for eating all of our food and not buying anything and shipping ramps.

1855
02:23:50,988 --> 02:23:51,628
[SPEAKER_05]: Good sushi, Mike.

1856
02:23:53,409 --> 02:23:53,709
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

1857
02:23:55,648 --> 02:23:59,714
[SPEAKER_21]: Dark Knight would like to give a gigantic FU to me getting sick and working at the same time.

1858
02:23:59,794 --> 02:24:00,875
[SPEAKER_21]: Somebody shoot me please.

1859
02:24:00,976 --> 02:24:04,280
[SPEAKER_21]: And one more FU for my dumbness when I took my placement test during the week.

1860
02:24:04,661 --> 02:24:06,323
[SPEAKER_21]: Talk about brain farts, man.

1861
02:24:07,383 --> 02:24:13,168
[SPEAKER_21]: Sigurd says, first FU goes to the show for not talking about drawn together nearly enough.

1862
02:24:13,308 --> 02:24:13,648
[SPEAKER_21]: Screw you.

1863
02:24:14,308 --> 02:24:17,691
[SPEAKER_21]: FU to Illusion for turning down offers of sex for his vote.

1864
02:24:18,151 --> 02:24:22,034
[SPEAKER_21]: And FU to Hot Topic for not having any drawn together shirts, even though they don't exist yet.

1865
02:24:22,335 --> 02:24:23,275
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, think about it this way.

1866
02:24:23,776 --> 02:24:31,222
[SPEAKER_21]: If Illusion had changed his vote from Gwen to Monolithic, then it would have been a tie, and Jamie probably would have went with Monolithic when she broke the tie.

1867
02:24:31,662 --> 02:24:33,343
[SPEAKER_21]: So, just think about that one.

1868
02:24:35,125 --> 02:24:35,625
[SPEAKER_21]: No, I wouldn't have.

1869
02:24:36,880 --> 02:24:37,681
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, okay, well, hey.

1870
02:24:38,862 --> 02:24:44,467
[SPEAKER_21]: Flareon A says, F you to Nintendo for not allowing Game Boy and Game Boy Color games to be played on the DS.

1871
02:24:44,967 --> 02:24:45,628
[SPEAKER_21]: What the fuck?

1872
02:24:46,569 --> 02:24:50,712
[SPEAKER_21]: This just goes along with Nintendo's method of getting you to buy the same thing 50 million times.

1873
02:24:51,933 --> 02:24:56,517
[SPEAKER_21]: MPQ says, F you to Microsoft for not letting me install Japanese IME.

1874
02:24:56,617 --> 02:24:57,678
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm having that same problem, too.

1875
02:24:58,139 --> 02:25:02,162
[SPEAKER_21]: F you to Suncoast for ripping me off and charging me... What?

1876
02:25:02,242 --> 02:25:02,402
[SPEAKER_21]: What?

1877
02:25:02,482 --> 02:25:02,983
[SPEAKER_21]: Explicit what?

1878
02:25:05,580 --> 02:25:08,641
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to download a different patch, not the Global IME from Microsoft.

1879
02:25:08,821 --> 02:25:09,621
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, maybe that's what's going on.

1880
02:25:09,762 --> 02:25:09,942
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1881
02:25:09,962 --> 02:25:13,323
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, don't rely on the Global IME for that.

1882
02:25:13,483 --> 02:25:17,824
[SPEAKER_21]: F you to Suncoast for ripping me off and charging me $30 a disc for Azumanga Daioh.

1883
02:25:17,904 --> 02:25:18,605
[SPEAKER_21]: I hope I said that right.

1884
02:25:19,025 --> 02:25:20,365
[SPEAKER_21]: F you to the Ty... What?

1885
02:25:20,385 --> 02:25:20,805
[SPEAKER_21]: What was that?

1886
02:25:21,426 --> 02:25:22,786
[SPEAKER_07]: You said it right, Azumanga Daioh.

1887
02:25:22,926 --> 02:25:24,087
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, I pronounced something right.

1888
02:25:24,107 --> 02:25:25,447
[SPEAKER_21]: What do you know?

1889
02:25:25,527 --> 02:25:28,668
[SPEAKER_21]: F you to the Tyco Drumsticks for being uncomfortable and hurting my hands.

1890
02:25:29,569 --> 02:25:32,310
[SPEAKER_21]: F you to people who call it singles and doubles on DDR.

1891
02:25:32,430 --> 02:25:33,110
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not tennis.

1892
02:25:34,474 --> 02:25:37,035
[SPEAKER_21]: Lastly, fuck everyone who has access to 2DX.

1893
02:25:38,576 --> 02:25:42,258
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been singles and doubles since the first one.

1894
02:25:42,718 --> 02:25:47,361
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it might be the way in which you say it.

1895
02:25:49,142 --> 02:25:51,383
[SPEAKER_21]: I think I might get what it is.

1896
02:25:51,443 --> 02:25:52,843
[SPEAKER_21]: I think I get the tennis comparison.

1897
02:25:54,364 --> 02:25:57,126
[SPEAKER_21]: Did I get the fuck everyone who has access to 2DX?

1898
02:25:57,306 --> 02:25:57,606
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know.

1899
02:25:58,046 --> 02:25:59,187
[SPEAKER_21]: Those are from MPQ.

1900
02:26:00,067 --> 02:26:03,449
[SPEAKER_21]: Poto says, F you to World of Warcraft, eating up every second of my life.

1901
02:26:05,814 --> 02:26:17,528
[SPEAKER_21]: Jaded2004 says F you to everyone who hates SmileDK Rychan says F you to myself for being emotionally stupid last night F you to egos killing the gaming star Hey, didn't I say that one?

1902
02:26:18,188 --> 02:26:24,356
[SPEAKER_21]: F you to tomorrow not being Thursday Aw, big hug Rychan, big hug Blarg says F you to

1903
02:26:26,121 --> 02:26:27,082
[SPEAKER_21]: Egalitarians?

1904
02:26:28,062 --> 02:26:28,943
[SPEAKER_21]: Egalitarians.

1905
02:26:30,144 --> 02:26:30,884
[SPEAKER_21]: Egalitarians.

1906
02:26:30,965 --> 02:26:31,765
[SPEAKER_21]: I can pronounce words.

1907
02:26:31,825 --> 02:26:32,926
[SPEAKER_21]: I just have to sound it out in my mind.

1908
02:26:33,346 --> 02:26:36,188
[SPEAKER_21]: Misty says, first and foremost, F you to the cage match.

1909
02:26:36,648 --> 02:26:39,250
[SPEAKER_21]: Secondly, F you to chicken tenders and French toast sticks.

1910
02:26:39,511 --> 02:26:43,193
[SPEAKER_21]: Because I think I'm just pissed about that because I was working those parts of the kitchen at the time.

1911
02:26:45,575 --> 02:26:45,795
[SPEAKER_21]: Oops.

1912
02:26:46,175 --> 02:26:47,276
[SPEAKER_21]: I hope I didn't close a new window.

1913
02:26:48,037 --> 02:26:49,257
[SPEAKER_21]: I hope I didn't miss somebody's F you.

1914
02:26:49,317 --> 02:26:49,858
[SPEAKER_21]: Sorry if I did.

1915
02:26:50,358 --> 02:26:54,881
[SPEAKER_21]: Snowcat says, F you to having a birthday in December and to people who think it's better to combine presents.

1916
02:26:55,041 --> 02:26:55,562
[SPEAKER_21]: Bastards.

1917
02:26:56,616 --> 02:27:00,117
[SPEAKER_21]: DJ Ranma S says, Giant FU to my job for cutting my hours again.

1918
02:27:00,157 --> 02:27:00,897
[SPEAKER_21]: You bastards!

1919
02:27:01,298 --> 02:27:02,298
[SPEAKER_21]: I gotta eat too, you know.

1920
02:27:02,658 --> 02:27:05,099
[SPEAKER_21]: Another FU to the retard tech that I work with.

1921
02:27:05,119 --> 02:27:06,119
[SPEAKER_21]: You are a fucking tool.

1922
02:27:06,479 --> 02:27:09,740
[SPEAKER_21]: I swear, if you did get a job through Affirmative Action, I'm putting in my two weeks.

1923
02:27:10,841 --> 02:27:11,681
[SPEAKER_21]: FU short version.

1924
02:27:12,401 --> 02:27:13,481
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, well, I read the long version.

1925
02:27:14,142 --> 02:27:14,362
[SPEAKER_21]: Sorry.

1926
02:27:15,342 --> 02:27:17,763
[SPEAKER_21]: Legend of Zaku says, F you to not having a girlfriend.

1927
02:27:18,243 --> 02:27:25,925
[SPEAKER_21]: F you to all the drama that I have to put up with in the DDR Freak New York forums, thus resulting in the locking of the forums for a short time and the near split that was about to happen.

1928
02:27:26,285 --> 02:27:29,546
[SPEAKER_21]: And F you to the Chinese language for being so fucking hard to speak and write.

1929
02:27:32,587 --> 02:27:34,427
[SPEAKER_21]: I could say something about the New York forum thing.

1930
02:27:35,988 --> 02:27:36,448
[SPEAKER_21]: No comment.

1931
02:27:37,168 --> 02:27:40,509
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, I'll comment because I have no status on Freak, so it's fine for me to comment.

1932
02:27:40,929 --> 02:27:40,989
[SPEAKER_21]: Um...

1933
02:27:42,398 --> 02:27:44,619
[SPEAKER_21]: You guys need to learn how to respect authority!

1934
02:27:45,319 --> 02:27:52,202
[SPEAKER_21]: No, I'm not saying you in particular, but, I mean, it seems like when somebody says, don't do this, like, a million people want to do it, and then you wonder why people get angry!

1935
02:27:54,263 --> 02:27:54,523
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway.

1936
02:27:55,303 --> 02:27:56,364
[SPEAKER_20]: Films off the internet.

1937
02:27:57,644 --> 02:27:57,884
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway.

1938
02:28:00,225 --> 02:28:01,766
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm gonna get shit for that, but I don't care.

1939
02:28:02,246 --> 02:28:04,587
[SPEAKER_21]: DarkTetsuya says, a continued FU to Comcast.

1940
02:28:04,607 --> 02:28:08,909
[SPEAKER_21]: I recently got to see the nuclear train wreck that is the new screensavers.

1941
02:28:09,409 --> 02:28:11,310
[SPEAKER_21]: I can tell the show's going down the toilet.

1942
02:28:12,887 --> 02:28:14,448
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, Rob, you said nuclear.

1943
02:28:16,668 --> 02:28:17,168
[SPEAKER_21]: That's a joke.

1944
02:28:18,489 --> 02:28:25,531
[SPEAKER_21]: F you to Xbox Live on Ultramix 2 being so glitchy that we had to start the tournament over five times because it kept quitting and being glitchy.

1945
02:28:25,991 --> 02:28:32,193
[SPEAKER_21]: F you to the douchebags in my English class that don't have the brain capacity to talk about anything other than sports for more than five seconds at a time.

1946
02:28:32,413 --> 02:28:34,714
[SPEAKER_21]: And F you to Sigurd for cheating on me.

1947
02:28:34,834 --> 02:28:35,574
[SPEAKER_21]: Man, what a whore.

1948
02:28:36,775 --> 02:28:37,115
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh my.

1949
02:28:41,172 --> 02:28:47,974
[SPEAKER_21]: VxJasonXV, who says I should just call him Jason, but I don't, says F you to data entry, it makes us lazy people cry.

1950
02:28:48,394 --> 02:28:55,096
[SPEAKER_21]: Funny that I call myself lazy, although I'm writing a program to parse data for me automatically instead of taking less time to just do it myself.

1951
02:28:56,537 --> 02:28:57,697
[SPEAKER_21]: And F you to irony.

1952
02:29:00,578 --> 02:29:02,079
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's going to do it for the F yous of the week.

1953
02:29:02,759 --> 02:29:03,719
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks for playing, boys and girls.

1954
02:29:03,839 --> 02:29:04,339
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, Loki.

1955
02:29:05,400 --> 02:29:06,020
[SPEAKER_20]: One last one.

1956
02:29:06,160 --> 02:29:08,941
[SPEAKER_20]: Fuck you, KFC, for getting rid of your sweet and sour sauce.

1957
02:29:12,506 --> 02:29:14,668
[SPEAKER_21]: Why would KFC get rid of sweet and sour sauce?

1958
02:29:14,748 --> 02:29:16,169
[SPEAKER_21]: Did PETA make them do that or something?

1959
02:29:17,049 --> 02:29:18,570
[SPEAKER_20]: They just got rid of their sweet and sour sauce!

1960
02:29:18,791 --> 02:29:25,956
[SPEAKER_20]: I got, uh, popcorn chicken, like, last week from there, and I was like, okay, I want some sweet- extra sweet and sour sauce, and I was like, oh, we don't have sweet and sour sauce.

1961
02:29:26,516 --> 02:29:26,716
[SPEAKER_20]: What?!

1962
02:29:27,657 --> 02:29:28,698
[SPEAKER_20]: What is this craziness?!

1963
02:29:29,959 --> 02:29:30,439
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't get it!

1964
02:29:30,519 --> 02:29:31,039
[SPEAKER_20]: What the hell?

1965
02:29:31,200 --> 02:29:33,541
[SPEAKER_20]: Why- why would you- that was, like, the best sauce they had!

1966
02:29:33,821 --> 02:29:34,662
[SPEAKER_20]: Now they have ranch!

1967
02:29:35,503 --> 02:29:36,003
[SPEAKER_20]: Woo!

1968
02:29:36,163 --> 02:29:36,624
[SPEAKER_20]: Ranch!

1969
02:29:37,204 --> 02:29:38,525
[SPEAKER_20]: Ranch and mustard!

1970
02:29:38,965 --> 02:29:39,826
[SPEAKER_20]: Honey mustard!

1971
02:29:41,496 --> 02:29:43,018
[SPEAKER_20]: I want my fucking sweet and sour sauce.

1972
02:29:43,078 --> 02:29:43,899
[SPEAKER_20]: It's like classic.

1973
02:29:44,199 --> 02:29:45,661
[SPEAKER_20]: McDonald's has their sweet and sour sauce.

1974
02:29:45,861 --> 02:29:48,004
[SPEAKER_20]: Fuck, I eat the sweet and sour sauce by itself.

1975
02:29:48,445 --> 02:29:52,209
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, I don't understand why you can't just give me the nice sweet and sour sauce you had.

1976
02:29:53,070 --> 02:29:54,132
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd buy up the reserves.

1977
02:29:54,853 --> 02:29:55,133
[SPEAKER_20]: I would.

1978
02:29:55,153 --> 02:29:56,415
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyways.

1979
02:29:56,435 --> 02:29:56,655
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyways.

1980
02:29:58,629 --> 02:30:00,150
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it's time to go to our break, boys and girls.

1981
02:30:00,210 --> 02:30:05,773
[SPEAKER_21]: When we come back from this break, I think we'll do a little bit of Ask Orange Lounge and we'll open up the Skype line again for those of you guys who want to get through and comment.

1982
02:30:06,173 --> 02:30:06,514
[SPEAKER_21]: Excuse me.

1983
02:30:06,954 --> 02:30:11,556
[SPEAKER_21]: So send in your questions for Ask Orange Lounge over private message to Sky in the chat room right now.

1984
02:30:12,397 --> 02:30:14,338
[SPEAKER_21]: In this break, I think we'll do some songs from 2DX.

1985
02:30:14,818 --> 02:30:15,999
[SPEAKER_21]: Just some 2DX potpourri.

1986
02:30:16,279 --> 02:30:16,539
[SPEAKER_21]: Enjoy.

1987
02:30:16,559 --> 02:30:16,539
... ... ...

1988
02:31:54,042 --> 02:31:54,763
Thanks for watching!

1989
02:32:38,351 --> 02:32:39,312
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

1990
02:34:53,968 --> 02:34:54,810
Thanks for watching!

1991
02:36:14,813 --> 02:36:16,055
[SPEAKER_21]: Orange Lounge Radio.

1992
02:36:16,395 --> 02:36:18,558
[SPEAKER_21]: We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.

1993
02:36:24,645 --> 02:36:26,988
[SPEAKER_21]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1994
02:36:27,448 --> 02:36:28,870
[SPEAKER_21]: Our chat room has gone crazy.

1995
02:36:29,010 --> 02:36:33,395
[SPEAKER_21]: I was making some jokes during the break there, and now everybody's talking about my pants.

1996
02:36:34,696 --> 02:36:37,738
[SPEAKER_21]: And I feel bad because there's a guy in there that really just needs a hug right now.

1997
02:36:38,058 --> 02:36:42,960
[SPEAKER_21]: And the talk about my pants and my name in various Bomani games is eclipsing that conversation.

1998
02:36:43,040 --> 02:36:44,581
[SPEAKER_21]: So, I feel bad.

1999
02:36:46,260 --> 02:36:49,201
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway, back to the dick and fart jokes we were talking about here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2000
02:36:49,301 --> 02:36:49,721
[SPEAKER_21]: No, seriously.

2001
02:36:49,801 --> 02:36:52,742
[SPEAKER_21]: Actually, I wanted to bring something up that Explosive was talking about during his FUs of the Week.

2002
02:36:53,802 --> 02:36:58,743
[SPEAKER_21]: I felt kind of bad for this guy over on The Freak who had posted something in the NorCal forums.

2003
02:36:58,763 --> 02:37:00,484
[SPEAKER_21]: Are there any other gay people that play DDR?

2004
02:37:01,044 --> 02:37:06,205
[SPEAKER_21]: And people just kind of, like, jumped down this guy's throat going, It doesn't matter!

2005
02:37:07,585 --> 02:37:08,766
[SPEAKER_21]: Why are you posting this shit?

2006
02:37:08,786 --> 02:37:09,346
[SPEAKER_21]: It shouldn't matter!

2007
02:37:09,406 --> 02:37:09,886
[SPEAKER_21]: And you know what?

2008
02:37:10,643 --> 02:37:11,304
[SPEAKER_21]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

2009
02:37:28,283 --> 02:37:29,363
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't mind that.

2010
02:37:29,383 --> 02:37:30,544
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't mind that.

2011
02:37:50,012 --> 02:37:50,552
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, God.

2012
02:37:50,572 --> 02:37:52,153
[SPEAKER_21]: More pants chat.

2013
02:37:52,193 --> 02:37:53,114
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you very much.

2014
02:37:55,975 --> 02:37:56,375
[SPEAKER_21]: No, it doesn't.

2015
02:37:56,615 --> 02:38:04,379
[SPEAKER_21]: But I kind of feel bad for the guy because when you are gay, sometimes it is hard to meet people in the same way that straight people kind of meet each other.

2016
02:38:04,679 --> 02:38:07,801
[SPEAKER_21]: And especially if you're the kind of person that's had an upbringing where you've had to be very

2017
02:38:08,221 --> 02:38:09,182
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey girl, you wanna go out with me?

2018
02:38:32,875 --> 02:38:36,159
[SPEAKER_11]: But seriously, man, just, if you're gay, just talk to people, man.

2019
02:38:36,199 --> 02:38:38,221
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't matter if you're gay or not.

2020
02:38:38,261 --> 02:38:57,659
[SPEAKER_21]: But I just think, now, where I think the guy may have made a mistake is maybe DDR Freak just isn't, maybe the place, people want to talk DDR and DDR Freak, they don't want to talk about, you know, but I think he was just looking for gay people who are into DDR, so I PM'd him some links, because there's actually a live general community that's like gay DDR players, there's gay gamers, get it, gamers communities and stuff like that, so.

2021
02:38:57,759 --> 02:39:03,724
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, yeah, it's okay to post on the NorCal and stuff, but I mean, you see that all the time in DJR chit-chat and stuff and general discussion.

2022
02:39:04,644 --> 02:39:06,626
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, you see, like, hundreds of topics like that, and...

2023
02:39:07,156 --> 02:39:08,356
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, yeah, and I agree.

2024
02:39:08,436 --> 02:39:16,659
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, it's almost, almost, it's very similar to the girls that play DDR topic, because for whatever reason, now, there's a difference, though.

2025
02:39:16,679 --> 02:39:17,439
[SPEAKER_21]: There's a difference.

2026
02:39:18,019 --> 02:39:21,721
[SPEAKER_21]: When it's a guy posting, are there any girls that play DDR?

2027
02:39:23,241 --> 02:39:23,921
[SPEAKER_08]: That's one thing.

2028
02:39:24,021 --> 02:39:25,222
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, exactly.

2029
02:39:25,282 --> 02:39:30,143
[SPEAKER_21]: That's just, you know, somebody who's sitting there downloading Violent Hypergirls freestyle videos.

2030
02:39:31,924 --> 02:39:33,304
[SPEAKER_08]: Love you, Aaron.

2031
02:39:33,504 --> 02:39:33,964
[SPEAKER_21]: Love you, Aaron.

2032
02:39:34,865 --> 02:39:35,345
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh...

2033
02:39:37,304 --> 02:39:40,006
[SPEAKER_21]: But when it's a girl posting, are there other girls that play DDR?

2034
02:39:40,026 --> 02:39:46,570
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, then, you know, you're just kind of like, okay, well, maybe, you know, it's kind of too bad that there aren't a lot of girls that, you know, go out to the arcade.

2035
02:39:46,670 --> 02:39:48,071
[SPEAKER_21]: But I think DDR has been bringing more.

2036
02:39:48,111 --> 02:39:50,252
[SPEAKER_21]: I think there's been more and more, but just in the past.

2037
02:39:50,272 --> 02:39:50,913
[SPEAKER_21]: There's more and more now.

2038
02:39:50,933 --> 02:39:55,015
[SPEAKER_21]: There's more and more now, but especially when I first started playing, there wasn't a whole lot that I would see at the arcades.

2039
02:39:55,075 --> 02:39:59,238
[SPEAKER_21]: Back in the days before DDR, when I would play pinball, I maybe once or twice saw a girl at the arcade.

2040
02:39:59,278 --> 02:40:02,120
[SPEAKER_11]: I only saw one girl back then, but now I see, like, a bunch of girls.

2041
02:40:02,760 --> 02:40:06,763
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I'm not sure if it's because of the FU tournament I helped organize in Sacramento or...

2042
02:40:07,904 --> 02:40:11,087
[SPEAKER_11]: or just the whole tournament issues nowadays that people want to get involved with.

2043
02:40:11,587 --> 02:40:15,590
[SPEAKER_20]: When I see girls posting that on the DDR Freak forums, I think, Ooh, lesbians!

2044
02:40:17,131 --> 02:40:18,072
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I think.

2045
02:40:19,253 --> 02:40:19,753
[SPEAKER_11]: Freak.

2046
02:40:19,913 --> 02:40:21,354
[SPEAKER_11]: Little girl, girl on girl mix.

2047
02:40:22,615 --> 02:40:25,858
[SPEAKER_21]: Jamie, do you have anything you want to add to this horrible discussion?

2048
02:40:26,943 --> 02:40:27,863
[SPEAKER_07]: Your pants are hot.

2049
02:40:28,103 --> 02:40:28,543
Shhh.

2050
02:40:29,304 --> 02:40:29,724
[SPEAKER_21]: Shove it.

2051
02:40:31,964 --> 02:40:33,124
[SPEAKER_20]: I know this is very late.

2052
02:40:33,384 --> 02:40:34,425
[SPEAKER_20]: It's another FU.

2053
02:40:34,905 --> 02:40:37,525
[SPEAKER_20]: FU to splitting my pants open this morning.

2054
02:40:37,825 --> 02:40:38,826
[SPEAKER_20]: That sucks.

2055
02:40:39,626 --> 02:40:44,287
[SPEAKER_20]: I was reaching for something and all of a sudden I hear this rip and there was my crotch exposed.

2056
02:40:44,787 --> 02:40:45,667
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, speaking of rip.

2057
02:40:45,727 --> 02:40:46,667
[SPEAKER_20]: You know what that means, right?

2058
02:40:46,947 --> 02:40:49,068
[SPEAKER_20]: You're fat.

2059
02:40:49,188 --> 02:40:49,828
[SPEAKER_20]: Know what it means?

2060
02:40:49,848 --> 02:40:53,069
[SPEAKER_20]: It's that I was laying on my pants and trying to stretch at the same time.

2061
02:40:53,189 --> 02:40:54,889
[SPEAKER_20]: It does not mean I'm fat, you dumbass.

2062
02:40:57,466 --> 02:40:57,846
[SPEAKER_21]: What is it?

2063
02:40:59,248 --> 02:41:00,208
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you have something you want to say?

2064
02:41:00,288 --> 02:41:01,930
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'm not going to comment on Loki on that one.

2065
02:41:01,950 --> 02:41:03,191
[SPEAKER_21]: Well then fine, you're fat too.

2066
02:41:04,072 --> 02:41:05,333
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, don't look fat.

2067
02:41:06,814 --> 02:41:07,935
[SPEAKER_11]: I just showed you my thugs, don't look fat.

2068
02:41:07,955 --> 02:41:09,436
[SPEAKER_21]: You're going to make me straight, God.

2069
02:41:09,737 --> 02:41:11,999
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, you know there's a camera right there.

2070
02:41:12,019 --> 02:41:14,941
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, look at my thugs.

2071
02:41:15,041 --> 02:41:23,288
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, sorry if it scares people for that.

2072
02:41:23,669 --> 02:41:24,709
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm changing the subject.

2073
02:41:29,178 --> 02:41:35,962
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

2074
02:41:36,443 --> 02:41:54,874
[SPEAKER_21]: One thing we won't find out because he already said But Loki split his pants today, therefore he must be fat You know, the butcher's knife is still clean It's one of the only dishes that's not dirty yet

2075
02:41:57,716 --> 02:41:59,577
[SPEAKER_21]: Seegard has a question starting it off.

2076
02:41:59,617 --> 02:42:00,697
[SPEAKER_21]: This will make you feel better, Loki.

2077
02:42:01,337 --> 02:42:03,778
[SPEAKER_21]: Who is your favorite drawn together character and why?

2078
02:42:07,299 --> 02:42:09,219
[SPEAKER_21]: Mine is Xander for obvious reasons.

2079
02:42:10,200 --> 02:42:12,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Mine is Nolan because I have a life and don't watch TV.

2080
02:42:13,261 --> 02:42:15,201
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh my god, that's such a tough question.

2081
02:42:15,561 --> 02:42:15,721
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh man.

2082
02:42:19,838 --> 02:42:21,259
[SPEAKER_20]: I would have to say Ling Ling.

2083
02:42:21,559 --> 02:42:25,461
[SPEAKER_20]: I love Ling Ling and just how funny and Japanese it is.

2084
02:42:25,921 --> 02:42:29,062
[SPEAKER_20]: And just like, it's more of like two characters.

2085
02:42:29,962 --> 02:42:32,183
[SPEAKER_20]: It's Spanky and Ling Ling.

2086
02:42:32,223 --> 02:42:34,324
[SPEAKER_20]: They're interactive, you know, interactions.

2087
02:42:34,544 --> 02:42:35,765
[SPEAKER_20]: That's the best part, you know.

2088
02:42:36,705 --> 02:42:42,308
[SPEAKER_20]: But Ling Ling's hilarious and... Are you looking forward to Christmas?

2089
02:42:44,945 --> 02:42:46,487
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, too bad there's no singles!

2090
02:42:47,950 --> 02:42:49,372
[SPEAKER_21]: But see, it was Xander who said that.

2091
02:42:51,635 --> 02:42:53,438
[SPEAKER_21]: I would say my second favorite, though, would be Foxy Love.

2092
02:42:54,199 --> 02:42:55,081
[SPEAKER_21]: I love Foxy Love.

2093
02:42:55,722 --> 02:42:56,082
Bleh.

2094
02:42:56,944 --> 02:42:57,404
[SPEAKER_20]: Bleh.

2095
02:42:58,486 --> 02:42:58,847
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway.

2096
02:43:01,425 --> 02:43:02,807
[SPEAKER_21]: Next question from MPQ.

2097
02:43:03,228 --> 02:43:05,851
[SPEAKER_21]: How many people care about the song Cartoon Heroes?

2098
02:43:05,891 --> 02:43:10,116
[SPEAKER_21]: It seems to me that people actually want the steps rather than the song.

2099
02:43:10,557 --> 02:43:15,223
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you think it would work if they took the steps and then put them on a 170 beat per minute Konami original or something?

2100
02:43:16,337 --> 02:43:20,659
[SPEAKER_21]: That's the one thing I can kind of see about Cartoon Heroes, why so many people want that song.

2101
02:43:20,719 --> 02:43:22,040
[SPEAKER_21]: Is it the steps?

2102
02:43:22,160 --> 02:43:23,040
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, that's fine.

2103
02:43:24,081 --> 02:43:26,022
[SPEAKER_21]: And I don't think it would work on any other song.

2104
02:43:26,042 --> 02:43:27,163
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, it would just be weird.

2105
02:43:32,245 --> 02:43:34,406
[SPEAKER_21]: But see, you're cutting out a little bit.

2106
02:43:34,446 --> 02:43:38,348
[SPEAKER_21]: He's saying something about the fact that if it was a 7-footer, not as many people would play it.

2107
02:43:38,528 --> 02:43:39,468
[SPEAKER_21]: I somewhat disagree.

2108
02:43:39,528 --> 02:43:43,010
[SPEAKER_21]: I think there's people that play it because they play Speed Over Beethoven as well.

2109
02:43:43,150 --> 02:43:44,170
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, that whole type of thing.

2110
02:43:44,550 --> 02:43:49,532
[SPEAKER_11]: Or we could say if the song was... Yeah, if it goes 140 BPM, then no one would play it at all.

2111
02:43:54,639 --> 02:43:57,861
[SPEAKER_11]: Think of the songs that are over here instead of BPM being overplayed.

2112
02:43:57,881 --> 02:43:58,721
[SPEAKER_21]: This is my thing.

2113
02:43:59,021 --> 02:44:02,523
[SPEAKER_21]: And this is the same thing when people ask, why aren't there enough 10-footers in DDR?

2114
02:44:03,123 --> 02:44:05,324
[SPEAKER_21]: Can you really play 10-footers on a homepad?

2115
02:44:05,444 --> 02:44:07,686
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, if you can and you're passing them, good for you.

2116
02:44:07,746 --> 02:44:08,966
[SPEAKER_21]: But you are in a minority.

2117
02:44:09,206 --> 02:44:10,927
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's face it, you are in the minority.

2118
02:44:12,088 --> 02:44:13,929
[SPEAKER_21]: If you can pass those kinds of songs on a homepad.

2119
02:44:14,949 --> 02:44:17,470
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you think all songs must be 10-footer?

2120
02:44:17,710 --> 02:44:18,251
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, let's go.

2121
02:44:19,952 --> 02:44:20,872
[SPEAKER_11]: Every freaking song.

2122
02:44:21,592 --> 02:44:22,633
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why you can make edits.

2123
02:44:23,911 --> 02:44:24,811
[SPEAKER_11]: if you don't like the steps.

2124
02:44:25,772 --> 02:44:26,572
[SPEAKER_11]: Simple question.

2125
02:44:26,972 --> 02:44:32,013
[SPEAKER_11]: Or just play in the groove and just hammer the machine so much so your feet dies and shit.

2126
02:44:32,053 --> 02:44:35,734
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, if there's one thing I'm not doing at home, it's hand plants.

2127
02:44:36,014 --> 02:44:36,495
[SPEAKER_21]: End of story.

2128
02:44:37,515 --> 02:44:38,575
[SPEAKER_11]: No fucking comment.

2129
02:44:38,595 --> 02:44:39,715
[SPEAKER_20]: Hand plants are so, like, 98.

2130
02:44:39,916 --> 02:44:43,797
[SPEAKER_11]: Hand plants are so ancient civilization.

2131
02:44:44,477 --> 02:44:46,517
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't go around kung, kung, kung.

2132
02:44:50,619 --> 02:44:51,859
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't need any more time to fight rape.

2133
02:44:58,041 --> 02:44:58,481
[SPEAKER_21]: Dark Knight.

2134
02:44:59,361 --> 02:45:02,602
[SPEAKER_21]: Everyone must be at the computer or on the webcam because all I see is Bradley.

2135
02:45:02,622 --> 02:45:02,962
[SPEAKER_21]: You're right.

2136
02:45:03,522 --> 02:45:09,484
[SPEAKER_21]: Our webcam kind of needs a new angle, I think, because obviously a lot of us kind of hide back here.

2137
02:45:09,644 --> 02:45:10,685
[SPEAKER_11]: He needs a spotlight.

2138
02:45:10,905 --> 02:45:12,885
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, we're angels kind of hiding back here.

2139
02:45:12,945 --> 02:45:18,447
[SPEAKER_21]: She's sitting on the ground next to Loki and I. And I see that Angel has candy, so I'm going to steal something.

2140
02:45:18,487 --> 02:45:19,768
[SPEAKER_11]: What the hell are you thinking?

2141
02:45:20,268 --> 02:45:20,668
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait, what?

2142
02:45:20,868 --> 02:45:21,908
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's in the forums.

2143
02:45:21,988 --> 02:45:22,749
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Matrix Walk.

2144
02:45:22,769 --> 02:45:22,989
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, my God.

2145
02:45:23,029 --> 02:45:23,309
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, my God.

2146
02:45:24,893 --> 02:45:29,598
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't want to bring up another FU, I just... Fucking Natalie Portman for not getting naked.

2147
02:45:31,019 --> 02:45:31,699
[SPEAKER_20]: I fucking hate that.

2148
02:45:31,940 --> 02:45:34,202
[SPEAKER_20]: You don't go see a movie... Okay, it's a fucking chick flick.

2149
02:45:34,921 --> 02:45:45,526
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, granted, there are some very funny scenes in there, like the whole, um, uh, what was it, internet, um, like, net porn type thing sequence that they had to classical music.

2150
02:45:45,566 --> 02:45:46,386
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, that was funny.

2151
02:45:46,906 --> 02:45:49,027
[SPEAKER_20]: I grant, that was the best part in the whole movie.

2152
02:45:49,567 --> 02:45:52,189
[SPEAKER_20]: But, Natalie Portman was not fucking naked!

2153
02:45:52,529 --> 02:45:54,670
[SPEAKER_20]: They advertised this movie as her being naked!

2154
02:45:54,890 --> 02:45:55,850
[SPEAKER_20]: And she was not naked!

2155
02:45:56,250 --> 02:45:56,631
[SPEAKER_20]: Why?

2156
02:45:56,831 --> 02:45:57,631
[SPEAKER_20]: Why, why?

2157
02:45:59,552 --> 02:46:02,193
[SPEAKER_20]: So, she falls in the same category now as the Olsen twins.

2158
02:46:02,593 --> 02:46:04,314
[SPEAKER_20]: Whereas, she needs to do porn.

2159
02:46:06,159 --> 02:46:10,041
[SPEAKER_20]: I have the perfect answer and you will agree with me.

2160
02:46:10,061 --> 02:46:10,401
[SPEAKER_21]: Iron Chef America.

2161
02:46:10,421 --> 02:46:10,541
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh God!

2162
02:46:34,798 --> 02:46:36,600
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we need more real Iron Chef.

2163
02:46:36,660 --> 02:46:38,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Iron Chef needs to come back on the air.

2164
02:46:38,482 --> 02:46:39,203
[SPEAKER_05]: The original.

2165
02:46:40,424 --> 02:46:40,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn it.

2166
02:46:41,045 --> 02:46:42,787
[SPEAKER_05]: We need Michiba to come out of retirement.

2167
02:46:43,127 --> 02:46:44,929
[SPEAKER_05]: And kick all their asses.

2168
02:46:45,109 --> 02:46:46,010
[SPEAKER_21]: I absolutely agree.

2169
02:46:46,130 --> 02:46:46,911
[SPEAKER_21]: Iron Chef America.

2170
02:46:47,672 --> 02:46:49,614
[SPEAKER_21]: Bobby Flay is a fucking faggot.

2171
02:46:49,774 --> 02:46:50,215
[SPEAKER_21]: I hate him.

2172
02:46:52,219 --> 02:46:55,221
[SPEAKER_20]: I was gonna say, I was gonna say, don't insult faggots, please

2173
02:47:13,290 --> 02:47:16,931
[SPEAKER_21]: Legend of Zaku says, okay, my 2DX skills are what some would say subpar.

2174
02:47:17,351 --> 02:47:24,092
[SPEAKER_21]: How does one make the conversion from single-handed seven-key play to double-handed play so that when I go out to play 2DX again, I don't end up sucking?

2175
02:47:25,492 --> 02:47:31,913
[SPEAKER_21]: I think training mode on the home versions is really good, but you said you don't have training mode, so you're kind of screwed, buddy.

2176
02:47:31,953 --> 02:47:32,554
[SPEAKER_21]: I hate to say it.

2177
02:47:33,254 --> 02:47:35,554
[SPEAKER_21]: Honestly, you're just going to have to practice, practice, practice.

2178
02:47:36,074 --> 02:47:37,134
[SPEAKER_21]: Arcadian, you play a lot of 2DX.

2179
02:47:37,154 --> 02:47:40,995
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you have any advice you could give to our buddy Zaku, if we can hear you on that mic?

2180
02:47:41,721 --> 02:47:42,261
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, practice.

2181
02:47:42,302 --> 02:47:43,743
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the only thing you really do.

2182
02:47:43,943 --> 02:47:45,324
[SPEAKER_21]: There really is nothing else you can do.

2183
02:47:45,364 --> 02:47:46,085
[SPEAKER_21]: There's no trick.

2184
02:47:46,345 --> 02:47:48,847
[SPEAKER_21]: There's no wrist exercise or anything you can do.

2185
02:47:49,027 --> 02:47:49,908
[SPEAKER_21]: You've just got to practice.

2186
02:47:50,428 --> 02:47:52,510
[SPEAKER_21]: Play as many different songs and different levels as you can.

2187
02:47:52,530 --> 02:47:52,690
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.

2188
02:47:52,750 --> 02:47:54,752
[SPEAKER_21]: Play songs you don't usually play.

2189
02:47:55,172 --> 02:48:00,897
[SPEAKER_21]: Every time you go to play 2DX, make your last song something you've never played before that's about the same skill level, same star level.

2190
02:48:01,077 --> 02:48:02,218
[SPEAKER_21]: That's the only way you're going to get better.

2191
02:48:02,238 --> 02:48:03,539
[SPEAKER_18]: Play things that are harder than you can do.

2192
02:48:03,639 --> 02:48:07,803
[SPEAKER_18]: I played the Anothers and everything when I first started out.

2193
02:48:08,383 --> 02:48:10,445
[SPEAKER_18]: Even though I couldn't even get near close to passing, I just...

2194
02:48:11,092 --> 02:48:21,940
[SPEAKER_21]: See them and try them out Sooner or later you can pass this part of your stuff Alright, let's move on Blarg says, who would you rather have sex with?

2195
02:48:23,341 --> 02:48:40,714
[SPEAKER_21]: God An 80 year old in an 8 year old's body Or an 8 year old in an 80 year old's body That's the point where I go to Goldies You know, actually I don't have to worry about it Yeah, you wouldn't have sex with a lady anyway

2196
02:48:42,459 --> 02:48:44,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless it was Margaret Cho, I don't know.

2197
02:48:45,020 --> 02:48:46,020
[SPEAKER_05]: I would with Margaret Cho.

2198
02:48:47,360 --> 02:48:51,641
[SPEAKER_21]: Would you rather have sex with an 8-year-old in an 80-year-old's body or an 80-year-old in an 8-year-old's body?

2199
02:48:53,581 --> 02:48:54,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Margaret Cho.

2200
02:48:55,501 --> 02:49:02,563
[SPEAKER_21]: Well... I'd choose D. This is totally the Loki side of me.

2201
02:49:04,343 --> 02:49:08,904
[SPEAKER_21]: But if the 80-year-old was inside the 8-year-old's body, she'd be experienced and tight, so...

2202
02:49:15,475 --> 02:49:16,456
[SPEAKER_20]: No, but you have to understand.

2203
02:49:16,476 --> 02:49:19,818
[SPEAKER_20]: You have to understand the logistics of it, okay?

2204
02:49:22,099 --> 02:49:30,085
[SPEAKER_20]: Would you rather play ball in a field that has short grass or a field that's just like turned to dust, okay?

2205
02:49:30,105 --> 02:49:33,647
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, you're going to have an unexperienced old chick.

2206
02:49:33,667 --> 02:49:34,568
[SPEAKER_20]: That's just nasty.

2207
02:49:34,628 --> 02:49:35,388
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, I'm sorry.

2208
02:49:36,269 --> 02:49:37,610
[SPEAKER_20]: But, if you think about it,

2209
02:49:38,857 --> 02:49:44,099
[SPEAKER_20]: Not only are you robbing the cradle, but you're fucking getting some older action at the same time.

2210
02:49:44,339 --> 02:49:46,119
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's like, it's wrong.

2211
02:49:47,060 --> 02:49:48,220
[SPEAKER_21]: Topic change, real quick.

2212
02:49:48,260 --> 02:49:49,961
[SPEAKER_21]: DJ Ranma S says, my question.

2213
02:49:50,401 --> 02:49:56,743
[SPEAKER_21]: As I was rudely interrupted earlier tonight, I missed half the show, but I could have sworn I heard Oduro Ponpokolin.

2214
02:49:57,303 --> 02:49:59,624
[SPEAKER_21]: Did I really hear that, and where can I find that song?

2215
02:49:59,664 --> 02:50:04,885
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, you did hear Oduro Ponpokolin, and it is actually the version, let me play a little clip of that for you guys.

2216
02:50:04,905 --> 02:50:06,406
[SPEAKER_08]: Oduro Ponpokolin

2217
02:50:08,234 --> 02:50:09,154
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, you did hear that.

2218
02:50:09,895 --> 02:50:11,435
[SPEAKER_21]: And DDR Festival.

2219
02:50:11,935 --> 02:50:13,816
[SPEAKER_21]: DDR Festival is one of the songs in there.

2220
02:50:13,876 --> 02:50:16,877
[SPEAKER_21]: So pick up the Festival soundtrack, I guess, if there is one.

2221
02:50:17,037 --> 02:50:17,897
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't think there is one yet.

2222
02:50:19,238 --> 02:50:20,158
[SPEAKER_21]: Or you can message Loki.

2223
02:50:20,178 --> 02:50:21,878
[SPEAKER_21]: He'll let you know where to find it.

2224
02:50:23,599 --> 02:50:25,200
[SPEAKER_20]: You have to find out DDR UK.

2225
02:50:25,220 --> 02:50:27,800
[SPEAKER_20]: It's very hard to find, though.

2226
02:50:27,840 --> 02:50:28,961
[SPEAKER_21]: Ranma S also says Sky.

2227
02:50:30,049 --> 02:50:32,350
[SPEAKER_21]: Similar stuff happens in the cosplay community.

2228
02:50:32,410 --> 02:50:33,911
[SPEAKER_21]: Points to my post in the chat.

2229
02:50:35,232 --> 02:50:35,692
[SPEAKER_21]: I missed it.

2230
02:50:35,833 --> 02:50:36,453
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sorry, buddy.

2231
02:50:36,473 --> 02:50:38,334
[SPEAKER_21]: You gotta send it over private message or I might miss it.

2232
02:50:40,095 --> 02:50:40,355
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright.

2233
02:50:46,214 --> 02:50:47,995
[SPEAKER_21]: What do you guys think about SongPack 7?

2234
02:50:48,455 --> 02:50:49,256
[SPEAKER_21]: Worth buying?

2235
02:50:51,557 --> 02:50:54,278
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, because I think you should support DDR, and it's just five bucks.

2236
02:50:54,338 --> 02:50:57,000
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, that's like, you know, lunch at Burger King.

2237
02:50:57,040 --> 02:50:57,620
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not that bad.

2238
02:50:57,900 --> 02:51:03,763
[SPEAKER_21]: And the new remix is pretty kickass, and then you can play Era against me online, and Era's a good song.

2239
02:51:03,923 --> 02:51:08,386
[SPEAKER_21]: If you honestly are just not into the remix, we played it for you guys later tonight.

2240
02:51:08,426 --> 02:51:10,587
[SPEAKER_21]: If you're just not feeling the I Feel remix...

2241
02:51:11,567 --> 02:51:40,127
[SPEAKER_21]: Then I guess maybe there isn't a whole lot for you to gain from this But I would say, you know what, buy it and just support DDR Because the more people that buy songpacks Yeah, this is what you get for coming late There's a new I Feel remix There's another FU, FU for being late Alright Okay, let's see Illusion says Jesus came to me and said he loved me so I kissed him I would like to ask your opinion if that was too forward

2242
02:51:45,202 --> 02:51:47,343
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, does that make him gay or Jesus gay?

2243
02:51:49,483 --> 02:51:50,664
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, maybe it was Jesus.

2244
02:51:51,004 --> 02:51:53,204
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, you know, maybe it wasn't the Jesus.

2245
02:51:53,264 --> 02:51:54,925
[SPEAKER_21]: Maybe it was some guy named Jesus, you know?

2246
02:51:57,206 --> 02:52:01,027
[SPEAKER_20]: And if he returned back to Earth, I think we have more things to worry about than your kiss.

2247
02:52:05,168 --> 02:52:09,829
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, I think Jesus would have just said, thank you, and then ran away.

2248
02:52:13,999 --> 02:52:16,861
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, he would forgive you for being a dirty homo sinner.

2249
02:52:22,384 --> 02:52:29,248
[SPEAKER_20]: You would have inevitably undone humanity because Jesus would then go to hell for being gay and a sinner.

2250
02:52:29,708 --> 02:52:35,412
[SPEAKER_20]: And yeah, Earth would end and humanity would go away.

2251
02:52:39,094 --> 02:52:39,354
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyways.

2252
02:52:41,328 --> 02:52:43,009
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, we don't have any more questions from our chat.

2253
02:52:43,129 --> 02:52:44,350
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, no, I think we just got another one.

2254
02:52:44,370 --> 02:52:49,733
[SPEAKER_21]: But I am going to open up the Skype line here over on www.orangehunterradio.com.

2255
02:52:49,753 --> 02:52:50,633
[SPEAKER_21]: Click on Interact With Us.

2256
02:52:52,134 --> 02:52:53,035
[SPEAKER_21]: DarkSakura says...

2257
02:52:54,051 --> 02:53:02,153
[SPEAKER_21]: I've been trying to dig up info on KR, Konami version, the Karaoke Revolution Konami version, but I only saw the small snippet on Konami's site.

2258
02:53:02,513 --> 02:53:03,793
[SPEAKER_21]: Is that all the info that's out there?

2259
02:53:04,474 --> 02:53:10,215
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, I have only been hearing about this secondhand, kind of, through Navi, the Poppin' Music Whore.

2260
02:53:10,595 --> 02:53:11,755
[SPEAKER_21]: He's been kind of following this.

2261
02:53:12,456 --> 02:53:13,676
[SPEAKER_21]: From what I understand...

2262
02:53:15,063 --> 02:53:17,883
[SPEAKER_21]: There is going to be a Karaoke Revolution Bomani version.

2263
02:53:18,024 --> 02:53:19,224
[SPEAKER_21]: Not in the US, okay?

2264
02:53:19,324 --> 02:53:20,324
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a Japanese mix.

2265
02:53:21,684 --> 02:53:25,645
[SPEAKER_21]: And I guess it's just going to be something that is happening.

2266
02:53:25,785 --> 02:53:28,865
[SPEAKER_21]: We don't know a whole lot about that, but there was questionnaires that happened already.

2267
02:53:29,385 --> 02:53:32,166
[SPEAKER_21]: And folks could fill out those questionnaires.

2268
02:53:32,986 --> 02:53:34,146
[SPEAKER_21]: But that's all we know right now.

2269
02:53:34,366 --> 02:53:38,347
[SPEAKER_21]: So there's nothing else we know that's going on with the Bomani edition as far as I know.

2270
02:53:39,207 --> 02:53:42,148
[SPEAKER_20]: It's all about Naha Naha Gachakun battle.

2271
02:53:43,008 --> 02:53:44,328
[SPEAKER_20]: That needs to be on there in duet mode.

2272
02:53:51,578 --> 02:53:52,718
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm eating gummy bears right now.

2273
02:53:52,778 --> 02:53:57,520
[SPEAKER_20]: The fun thing you can do about these, you can bite them in half and lick one end of it and stick it to stuff.

2274
02:53:57,580 --> 02:53:59,001
[SPEAKER_20]: And it will stick there for a long time.

2275
02:53:59,341 --> 02:54:06,323
[SPEAKER_20]: And if you stick it to someone's back window and they don't notice it, when they try to peel it off, it's all slimy because of all the moist air outside.

2276
02:54:06,463 --> 02:54:07,443
[SPEAKER_20]: It's really fun to do.

2277
02:54:09,504 --> 02:54:11,505
[SPEAKER_20]: So bite a gummy bear in half, stick it to your friend.

2278
02:54:13,906 --> 02:54:14,826
[SPEAKER_20]: How is that for random?

2279
02:54:17,009 --> 02:54:17,389
[SPEAKER_21]: Wow.

2280
02:54:18,830 --> 02:54:19,470
[SPEAKER_21]: Very interesting.

2281
02:54:21,470 --> 02:54:24,251
[SPEAKER_21]: I guess it's time to start wrapping up this show, you guys.

2282
02:54:24,271 --> 02:54:29,092
[SPEAKER_03]: The show's just about... Oh, oh, oh.

2283
02:54:29,532 --> 02:54:30,733
[SPEAKER_21]: Angel reminded me of something.

2284
02:54:31,613 --> 02:54:32,353
[SPEAKER_21]: Not so subtly.

2285
02:54:32,693 --> 02:54:33,853
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, this is something I wanted to bring.

2286
02:54:33,893 --> 02:54:36,314
[SPEAKER_21]: I wanted to bring this up in the first hour of the show, and I totally forgot.

2287
02:54:36,674 --> 02:54:38,614
[SPEAKER_21]: Angel went and got a Happy Meal at McDonald's today.

2288
02:54:41,555 --> 02:54:44,516
[SPEAKER_21]: There's no shame in a Happy Meal at the Happy Meals.

2289
02:54:46,078 --> 02:54:48,745
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw Sonic and I'm like, hmm, maybe it's a figurine.

2290
02:54:49,502 --> 02:54:50,202
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, exactly.

2291
02:54:50,262 --> 02:54:51,463
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a Sonic Happy Meal.

2292
02:54:51,523 --> 02:54:54,885
[SPEAKER_21]: I guess they teamed up with Sonic the Hedgehog to do these Sonic Happy Meals at McDonald's right now.

2293
02:54:55,165 --> 02:54:55,485
[SPEAKER_21]: Look at this.

2294
02:54:55,805 --> 02:54:58,387
[SPEAKER_21]: She got a free little game with hers.

2295
02:54:58,647 --> 02:55:00,908
[SPEAKER_21]: Like, these are the kind of games like Mr. Game & Watch.

2296
02:55:00,928 --> 02:55:01,729
[SPEAKER_21]: Tiger Toys!

2297
02:55:01,849 --> 02:55:02,689
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, the Tiger Toys.

2298
02:55:02,709 --> 02:55:03,210
[SPEAKER_21]: You remember these?

2299
02:55:03,530 --> 02:55:05,531
[SPEAKER_21]: These used to be the things we would get for Christmas.

2300
02:55:05,611 --> 02:55:09,093
[SPEAKER_21]: These shitty little, like, watch games that we would get for Christmas as a kid.

2301
02:55:09,813 --> 02:55:12,935
[SPEAKER_21]: And now they're coming in freaking Happy Meals, and it's a little Sonic one.

2302
02:55:13,235 --> 02:55:16,337
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's basically a ghetto version of the bonus stage from Sonic 2.

2303
02:55:17,437 --> 02:55:19,318
[SPEAKER_21]: My God, this is a Happy Meal toy.

2304
02:55:19,679 --> 02:55:26,963
[SPEAKER_21]: I remember when we used to get shitty little wind-up toys and little plushy things and fucking Beanie Babies with Happy Meals.

2305
02:55:27,403 --> 02:55:29,765
[SPEAKER_21]: And now we get freaking video games with Sonic.

2306
02:55:30,065 --> 02:55:32,066
[SPEAKER_21]: And when did Sonic start making a comeback in the U.S.?

2307
02:55:32,086 --> 02:55:32,946
[SPEAKER_21]: That's the other thing.

2308
02:55:33,847 --> 02:55:34,908
[SPEAKER_21]: I guess I've just been asleep.

2309
02:55:34,928 --> 02:55:35,348
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, that's right.

2310
02:55:35,388 --> 02:55:36,148
[SPEAKER_21]: He's got the cartoon.

2311
02:55:36,449 --> 02:55:37,529
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, so I've just been asleep.

2312
02:55:37,569 --> 02:55:37,949
[SPEAKER_21]: That's fine.

2313
02:55:38,410 --> 02:55:41,411
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, Sonic's cool and all, so I'm glad that they're doing the Happy Meal thing.

2314
02:55:41,451 --> 02:55:43,533
[SPEAKER_21]: But, man, you get a freaking...

2315
02:55:44,253 --> 02:55:44,593
[SPEAKER_21]: Game?

2316
02:55:44,633 --> 02:55:49,376
[SPEAKER_21]: Like, this is the kind of stuff we would open up on Christmas Day and be excited about, and now you get it in a freaking Happy Meal.

2317
02:55:49,396 --> 02:55:49,916
[SPEAKER_21]: What's up with that?

2318
02:55:56,259 --> 02:55:58,200
[SPEAKER_21]: Is there something you wanted to add to that, Jamie?

2319
02:55:58,240 --> 02:55:58,960
[SPEAKER_21]: You're a Sonic fan.

2320
02:55:59,000 --> 02:55:59,721
[SPEAKER_21]: Is this cool?

2321
02:55:59,741 --> 02:56:00,801
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I just like to thread.

2322
02:56:01,802 --> 02:56:01,902
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh.

2323
02:56:05,183 --> 02:56:09,245
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand how cool the free iPods are, but don't start a thread about it!

2324
02:56:10,406 --> 02:56:10,986
[SPEAKER_03]: God, people...

2325
02:56:14,531 --> 02:56:15,692
[SPEAKER_20]: They're giving them away for free.

2326
02:56:15,912 --> 02:56:18,835
[SPEAKER_20]: Does that tell you anything about how crappy they are?

2327
02:56:19,776 --> 02:56:20,336
[SPEAKER_20]: They're free!

2328
02:56:20,676 --> 02:56:21,757
[SPEAKER_20]: They can toss them away!

2329
02:56:23,779 --> 02:56:24,059
[SPEAKER_20]: Sad.

2330
02:56:25,020 --> 02:56:25,761
[SPEAKER_21]: I love my iPod.

2331
02:56:25,801 --> 02:56:26,381
[SPEAKER_21]: You shut your mouth.

2332
02:56:28,363 --> 02:56:29,724
[SPEAKER_21]: We gotta wrap up the show, boys and girls.

2333
02:56:31,286 --> 02:56:32,967
[SPEAKER_21]: Next week on the show, more randomness.

2334
02:56:35,329 --> 02:56:37,611
[SPEAKER_21]: In two weeks, I'm gonna be going to AI, Arcade Infinity.

2335
02:56:37,631 --> 02:56:38,532
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm making an LA trip.

2336
02:56:38,592 --> 02:56:39,072
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm hoping!

2337
02:56:40,003 --> 02:56:45,765
[SPEAKER_21]: I may not get to go for sure, but that's kind of what I'm trying to do is go to Arcade Infinity probably next Thursday.

2338
02:56:45,825 --> 02:56:47,245
[SPEAKER_21]: Not this coming Thursday, but next Thursday.

2339
02:56:47,285 --> 02:56:48,906
[SPEAKER_21]: So I hope to see some of you guys there.

2340
02:56:49,966 --> 02:56:50,607
[SPEAKER_21]: Our stalker fans.

2341
02:56:50,627 --> 02:56:51,087
[SPEAKER_21]: That'll be fun.

2342
02:56:51,807 --> 02:56:57,049
[SPEAKER_21]: And my goal is to get a whole bunch of EMUs cards and get them way on the show to those less fortunate who can't get them.

2343
02:56:57,589 --> 02:56:59,229
[SPEAKER_21]: So we'll see what happens with that.

2344
02:57:00,710 --> 02:57:03,311
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway, next week on the show, more of the same stuff.

2345
02:57:03,351 --> 02:57:05,351
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to try and line up an interview for next week's show.

2346
02:57:05,372 --> 02:57:06,752
[SPEAKER_21]: I want to interview somebody again.

2347
02:57:07,128 --> 02:57:09,289
[SPEAKER_21]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2348
02:57:34,588 --> 02:57:40,652
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, this week's going to be a crazy week, and my work's not going to be too happy with me taking off another day on Thursday, but... What the hell with them?

2349
02:57:41,313 --> 02:57:41,513
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh!

2350
02:57:42,274 --> 02:57:43,835
[SPEAKER_20]: Actually, the... Ah, fuck, that sucks!

2351
02:57:44,255 --> 02:57:46,056
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm supposed to get my check on Tuesday.

2352
02:57:46,837 --> 02:57:47,437
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, well, I'll have to wait.

2353
02:57:48,317 --> 02:57:50,419
[SPEAKER_20]: We get our bonuses next week, so that's kind of cool.

2354
02:57:51,420 --> 02:57:57,964
[SPEAKER_20]: But I have to buy gifts, and I think Nelly wants diamonds again, and, you know... Fucking women and their expensive gifts.

2355
02:57:59,945 --> 02:58:02,747
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyways... Yeah, that's all.

2356
02:58:04,526 --> 02:58:05,066
[SPEAKER_20]: Nick!

2357
02:58:06,908 --> 02:58:07,668
[SPEAKER_21]: Angel, your final thought.

2358
02:58:08,528 --> 02:58:10,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Brock's Candy Company needs to be sued.

2359
02:58:11,350 --> 02:58:11,630
[SPEAKER_21]: For?

2360
02:58:12,291 --> 02:58:13,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Making these things damn good.

2361
02:58:13,972 --> 02:58:14,272
[SPEAKER_04]: God.

2362
02:58:15,973 --> 02:58:17,714
[SPEAKER_21]: Maple nut goodies.

2363
02:58:17,754 --> 02:58:18,454
[SPEAKER_21]: They're really good.

2364
02:58:18,674 --> 02:58:19,275
[SPEAKER_21]: They're very good.

2365
02:58:19,295 --> 02:58:20,395
[SPEAKER_21]: I've been snacking on it all night.

2366
02:58:21,976 --> 02:58:22,957
[SPEAKER_21]: Arcadia, your final thought.

2367
02:58:23,157 --> 02:58:23,577
[SPEAKER_18]: Can you hear me?

2368
02:58:24,057 --> 02:58:24,217
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

2369
02:58:24,297 --> 02:58:24,958
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, okay.

2370
02:58:25,038 --> 02:58:27,899
[SPEAKER_18]: I only had one piece of sushi last night.

2371
02:58:27,980 --> 02:58:28,540
[SPEAKER_18]: I need more!

2372
02:58:29,318 --> 02:58:31,360
[SPEAKER_18]: More sushi!

2373
02:58:31,640 --> 02:58:35,844
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't think Anita's listening anymore, but you need to go bang down her door.

2374
02:58:35,864 --> 02:58:37,066
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't really need her.

2375
02:58:37,886 --> 02:58:40,749
[SPEAKER_18]: Unless she wants to make some more, that'd be cool.

2376
02:58:41,270 --> 02:58:42,050
[SPEAKER_18]: Sushi from somewhere.

2377
02:58:42,171 --> 02:58:43,152
[SPEAKER_18]: Sushi's wonderful.

2378
02:58:43,672 --> 02:58:45,914
[SPEAKER_19]: We need, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie!

2379
02:58:45,974 --> 02:58:46,395
[SPEAKER_18]: Sushi night.

2380
02:58:48,476 --> 02:58:49,077
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, oh my god.

2381
02:58:49,097 --> 02:58:51,098
[SPEAKER_21]: You're off Atkins now, so we need a sushi night.

2382
02:58:51,438 --> 02:58:52,099
[SPEAKER_19]: Or sushi lunch.

2383
02:58:52,899 --> 02:58:53,139
[SPEAKER_21]: Maybe.

2384
02:58:53,459 --> 02:58:54,340
[SPEAKER_05]: Sushi lunch would be better.

2385
02:58:54,360 --> 02:58:56,401
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I'm still not eating sugars at night.

2386
02:58:56,501 --> 02:58:58,322
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm teaching, so it may be difficult.

2387
02:58:58,522 --> 02:58:58,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Weekend.

2388
02:58:59,623 --> 02:59:00,444
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, yeah, I think that works.

2389
02:59:00,464 --> 02:59:00,824
[SPEAKER_21]: That'd be cool.

2390
02:59:00,984 --> 02:59:01,364
[SPEAKER_19]: One more thought.

2391
02:59:01,464 --> 02:59:02,245
One more thought.

2392
02:59:03,325 --> 02:59:04,426
[SPEAKER_20]: I was thinking the other day.

2393
02:59:05,507 --> 02:59:07,788
[SPEAKER_20]: This is very important, so everyone pay attention.

2394
02:59:10,410 --> 02:59:13,291
[SPEAKER_20]: We haven't done a QZAR night in a while.

2395
02:59:14,252 --> 02:59:15,032
[SPEAKER_20]: We need to do one again.

2396
02:59:17,174 --> 02:59:17,474
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'll

2397
02:59:18,174 --> 02:59:21,555
[SPEAKER_20]: Check on the forums, or not the forums, but check on LiveJournal.

2398
02:59:23,116 --> 02:59:26,657
[SPEAKER_20]: There will be a new QZernite, and we will reign supreme again!

2399
02:59:26,677 --> 02:59:28,397
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, I'm done.

2400
02:59:30,758 --> 02:59:31,678
[SPEAKER_21]: Explicit, your final thought.

2401
02:59:32,899 --> 02:59:40,821
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, if I wanted to get to work early, I should have just ran every fucking marathon runner over, GTA style.

2402
02:59:44,272 --> 02:59:44,532
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

2403
02:59:45,852 --> 02:59:48,233
[SPEAKER_21]: My final thought is thanks for listening.

2404
02:59:48,413 --> 02:59:53,014
[SPEAKER_21]: And tune in to our spinoff shows, damn you, because we need more people to listen to that because they're cool.

2405
02:59:53,754 --> 02:59:56,074
[SPEAKER_21]: And we're almost to the end of the year.

2406
02:59:56,114 --> 03:00:00,415
[SPEAKER_21]: There might be big changes coming to Orange Lounge Radio in 2005, which reminds me, we need to have a staff meeting.

2407
03:00:00,455 --> 03:00:02,536
[SPEAKER_21]: I know we don't ever have staff meetings, but we need to have a staff meeting.

2408
03:00:03,136 --> 03:00:05,576
[SPEAKER_21]: Maybe that can be the sushi lunch, even though Loki doesn't eat sushi.

2409
03:00:05,916 --> 03:00:07,157
[SPEAKER_05]: We can go to a multiple place.

2410
03:00:07,957 --> 03:00:08,157
[SPEAKER_21]: What?

2411
03:00:08,417 --> 03:00:10,077
[SPEAKER_05]: We can go to a place that has teriyaki, too.

2412
03:00:10,097 --> 03:00:10,657
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, we'll do that.

2413
03:00:11,518 --> 03:00:12,438
[SPEAKER_21]: We need to have a staff meeting.

2414
03:00:12,678 --> 03:00:13,318
[SPEAKER_21]: Staff meeting.

2415
03:00:14,852 --> 03:00:15,792
[SPEAKER_21]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

2416
03:00:17,593 --> 03:00:18,793
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate my allergies.

2417
03:00:20,373 --> 03:00:21,954
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate your allergies too.

2418
03:00:21,994 --> 03:00:25,055
[SPEAKER_03]: My allergies hit you back, so yeah.

2419
03:00:25,075 --> 03:00:25,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, cool.

2420
03:00:26,455 --> 03:00:26,755
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright.

2421
03:00:27,675 --> 03:00:29,156
[SPEAKER_21]: Final word of the show tonight.

2422
03:00:29,756 --> 03:00:30,736
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll give to Angel, why not?

2423
03:00:33,057 --> 03:00:33,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn it, Brox.

2424
03:00:34,357 --> 03:00:34,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's it.

2425
03:00:37,191 --> 03:00:42,054
[SPEAKER_16]: That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

2429
03:01:03,553 --> 03:01:30,379
