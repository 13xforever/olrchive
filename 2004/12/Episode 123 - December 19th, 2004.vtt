08:58.140 --> 09:03.140
My heart is beating, but you won't let me down

Nightfall is my time

I'm a thousand feet, heart is flowing

09:14.140 --> 09:19.140
Christmas is here

You guys know what? The chat room was demanding more Silent Hill, so here you go.

11:14.140 --> 11:37.140
I cry out of my head And I don't know what I've found

11:37.140 --> 11:47.140
Over and over, I feel a great mental

11:47.140 --> 11:52.140
Waiting for a gentle wave

11:52.140 --> 11:57.140
A gentle wave, a gentle wave

11:57.140 --> 12:02.140
On the sidewalk, on the city, on the streets, just don't whisper

12:02.140 --> 12:07.140
Busy people, goin' nowhere, see me talkin' no rain

12:07.140 --> 12:12.140
Not for passion, nothin' matters, my resistance is waning

12:12.140 --> 12:21.140
Like a flower in a basement waiting for our love, yeah

12:42.140 --> 12:59.140
It's got to fall over The rain that blows in the wind is dancing

12:59.140 --> 13:06.140
It would be a much better fight With you, with me

13:06.140 --> 13:13.140
If you hadn't met me, I'd be fine on my own, baby

13:13.140 --> 13:19.140
Never felt so lonely then you came along

13:19.140 --> 13:22.140
So now what should I do?

13:22.140 --> 13:25.140
I'm strung out, addicted to you

13:25.140 --> 13:29.140
My body aches now that you're gone

13:29.140 --> 13:34.140
My surprise fell through

13:34.140 --> 13:39.140
And they gave me everything you had and more

13:39.140 --> 13:41.140
It craves my happiness

13:41.140 --> 13:45.140
When you made me feel joy and made you smile

13:45.140 --> 13:48.140
But now I feel your stress

13:48.140 --> 13:53.140
Love was never meant to be such a crazy affair, no

13:53.140 --> 13:55.140
And who has time but you?

13:55.140 --> 14:00.140
Never thought I'd sit around and unravel your love

14:00.140 --> 14:05.140
Up until now

14:05.140 --> 14:27.340
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 123 on your radio right now.

14:27.340 --> 14:31.140
And I apologize to you guys if you're hearing a little bit of a buzz in the background tonight.

14:31.140 --> 14:34.060
One of our cords, I think it's a little bit stripped, so we've got to get it replaced

14:34.060 --> 14:38.300
and I think that stripping is causing the buzz, so we'll look into getting that replaced

14:38.300 --> 14:43.100
before the new year, but for tonight, you're gonna have to deal with it, so I apologize.

14:43.100 --> 14:50.100
Anyway, so here we are, almost at the end of 2004, just when I was finally remembering

14:50.100 --> 14:54.980
to write 04 on my checks instead of 03, the damn year's almost over, and now I'm gonna

14:54.980 --> 15:01.100
have to start writing 05, or I'm really gonna be screwed. So, what's first, presents or

15:01.100 --> 15:02.100
How was your week? How was your week?

15:02.100 --> 15:03.100
Presents!

15:03.100 --> 15:04.100
Presents first?

15:04.100 --> 15:05.100
You mean we're going to make an exception?

15:05.100 --> 15:06.100
Presents!

15:06.100 --> 15:07.100
The rule that we always do?

15:07.100 --> 15:08.100
Presents!

15:08.100 --> 15:09.100
Alright.

15:09.100 --> 15:10.100
Fair enough.

15:10.100 --> 15:11.100
I mean presents are, you know.

15:11.100 --> 15:12.100
Okay.

15:12.100 --> 15:13.100
Now.

15:13.100 --> 15:14.100
Yeah, I know.

15:14.100 --> 15:15.100
Loki ran away.

15:15.100 --> 15:16.100
We'll get him back.

15:16.100 --> 15:17.100
Loki came home, by the way.

15:17.100 --> 15:19.260
Loki came home during the break, so I don't know if he's going to be involved in this

15:19.260 --> 15:22.740
show tonight or if he's going to be kind of in and out or whatever, but he's here and

15:22.740 --> 15:26.940
he's trying to get our webcam up and running as well over on OrangeLaunchRadio.com, so check

15:26.940 --> 15:27.940
that out.

15:27.940 --> 15:28.940
Um.

15:28.940 --> 15:29.940
Also, joining.

15:29.940 --> 15:30.940
Because it's up and running.

15:30.940 --> 15:35.140
it's not on the website yet. I gotta turn on the switch on the website. Also joining

15:35.140 --> 15:39.860
us tonight, we have Arcadian 42 came in during the break. You know it's 6.30, buddy, right?

15:39.860 --> 15:42.740
No, I'm just kidding. Do we have a mic for Arcadian? Was there another mic over there?

15:42.740 --> 15:46.940
There should be another mic over there. There should be. Somewhere. We get it? Under the

15:46.940 --> 15:52.900
rubble. There you go. Can you hear me? It's under the big Christmas present montage there

15:52.900 --> 15:56.900
we have all of Loki's presents. By the way, I'd just like to point out, I have not started

15:56.900 --> 16:01.960
my shopping yet. So, even though we are going to be doing a little bit of gifts tonight,

16:01.960 --> 16:05.760
it just makes Christmas last longer if I don't give my gifts until next week. And then I...

16:05.760 --> 16:09.860
That's what you're calling it. No, well, I'm not going to break my Christmas tradition

16:09.860 --> 16:15.060
of doing all my shopping on Christmas Eve. So, sorry. Shop the day after Christmas. Or

16:15.060 --> 16:17.500
that. That's even better, honestly. Because I've been telling everyone to get me gift

16:17.500 --> 16:21.060
cards. Oh, gift cards are awesome. So I can take advantage of those with sales. Didn't

16:21.060 --> 16:25.780
I get you a gift card last year? I think you did. I think you're probably going to get

16:25.780 --> 16:29.700
another one this year cuz they're the easiest presents to buy. And you know what? I went

16:29.700 --> 16:34.380
the day after Christmas. Exactly. It's a good gift to get. Alright, presents. Then, Jamie,

16:34.380 --> 16:37.380
you better go first. What's this first present you have here? This is something from Angel.

16:37.380 --> 16:44.500
I think it's like a couple of 40s. It's about... Is it bigger than a bread box? Uh, lengthwise,

16:44.500 --> 16:49.500
no. Here's the thing. Jamie has to guess her present in 20 questions or less or we're gonna

16:49.500 --> 16:56.500
smash it in front of everybody. No! No, I'm gonna... I'll guess after I open it. Alright.

16:56.840 --> 17:03.840
It's beer. By the way, while Jamie is opening her gift, we have a request from the chat

17:06.320 --> 17:12.760
room. At some point tonight... What'd you get, Jamie? It's the cocoa mug set with teddy

17:12.760 --> 17:19.760
the

17:19.960 --> 17:23.340
pro in the angel said they're going to see jamie needs a little more cute once

17:23.340 --> 17:25.160
in awhile

17:25.160 --> 17:26.120
it's very cute

17:26.120 --> 17:28.460
and so i was creating a way to be happy

17:28.460 --> 17:29.140
start about that

17:29.140 --> 17:31.880
arch at room over doors are completely out yet

17:31.880 --> 17:34.680

17:37.300 --> 17:39.500

18:07.280 --> 18:12.360

18:47.000 --> 18:52.440
a Final Fantasy XI soundtrack? Yes, it is. What a cool! Oh, that's awesome. Because you

18:52.440 --> 18:59.400
know I'm an addict and everything. Mm-hmm. Is that the same thing you got, Angel? It

18:59.400 --> 19:04.720
it is. I have been looking at that, that for three months, cause I knew three months ago

19:04.720 --> 19:12.520

19:12.520 --> 19:16.320
the same time very difficult. Well thank you both, it's a very, very nice thing. Thank

19:16.320 --> 19:23.440

19:32.440 --> 19:46.640
trapezoid style box. All I can see is limited guarantee. Because I need that, don't I? It's

19:46.640 --> 19:51.840
a Jenny Craig gift pack. Oh, it's a case for the DS. Good, because I need one of those.

20:40.280 --> 20:43.120
it's a mix between uh...

20:43.120 --> 20:48.120
Pokemon and, uh, what am I trying to say, Tamagotchi, kind of.

20:48.120 --> 20:55.120
That's cool. I wanted to check this out, so that's good. Yay!

20:55.120 --> 21:04.120
Thank you guys! I love you guys! Give a hug, Angel hug. Even though I have headphones on, so I can't really move. Long distance hug, baby!

21:04.120 --> 21:08.120
Alright. Aww, can you feel the love here on Orange Lawn's radio?

21:08.120 --> 21:13.120
Yeah. I'm so excited. I love Final Fantasy XI music, too. It's so good.

21:13.120 --> 21:16.720
I figured that that would be something you'd really dig.

21:16.720 --> 21:20.920
Okay, okay, look, he has to open his present now. Wait, I just want to say, this is like my favorite artwork

21:20.920 --> 21:25.620
in all of Final Fantasy XI, by the way, is that world map that's drawn all artistic style.

21:25.620 --> 21:29.020
That's Amano. If I could get a huge poster of that. That's Amano's art.

21:29.020 --> 21:33.620
Is it? It's so sexy. He did all that, because I used to use one of those wallpapers

21:33.620 --> 21:35.620
For the short time I played.

22:03.620 --> 22:10.620
I tried to get a cupcake to put with him so I could give you death cake, but I didn't have time.

22:33.620 --> 22:48.340
It's an amazing, pooping reindeer. That's lovely.

22:48.340 --> 22:51.140
Nellie's infatuated with a pooping reindeer, apparently.

22:51.140 --> 22:52.220
And you can eat the poop!

22:52.220 --> 22:59.100
Are you going to give Nellie the poop?

22:59.100 --> 23:02.740
Yeah, she can have the poop.

23:02.740 --> 23:06.500
We're gonna put this all on the webcam, so you guys can see, during the next break, we'll

23:06.500 --> 23:07.500
get to it.

23:07.500 --> 23:09.740
Or actually, I'll walk over there right now, while Jamie-

23:09.740 --> 23:11.780
That gives me happy Joan soda.

23:11.780 --> 23:12.780
Is that all the gifts?

23:12.780 --> 23:13.780
Okay.

23:13.780 --> 23:18.180
Aw, well, there'll be more gifts next week, I promise, I promise.

23:18.180 --> 23:21.940
Well, we're gonna just find a way to get it to you anyway, DDR Angel.

23:21.940 --> 23:23.500
Alright, here we go.

23:23.500 --> 23:24.500
I got a whole week.

23:24.500 --> 23:25.500
Alright.

23:25.500 --> 23:26.500
Hey, there's Death Pie in there.

23:26.500 --> 23:27.500
Let's go back-

23:27.500 --> 23:29.140
Okay, we have Death Pie.

23:29.140 --> 23:32.260
Alright, let's go back to how we start off every show.

23:32.260 --> 23:34.840
We got a little sidetracked, but presents are a good reason to sidetrack.

23:34.840 --> 23:35.840
I like presents.

23:35.840 --> 23:36.840
All right.

23:36.840 --> 23:39.760
We're going to start off tonight's show playing a little bit of how was your week, how was

23:39.760 --> 23:40.760
your day?

23:40.760 --> 23:46.920
Well, my week was all, I was just feeling really stressed out and crappy all week.

23:46.920 --> 23:49.520
I went to my last day of class on Monday.

23:49.520 --> 23:52.540
I found out that I made a B in my business law class.

23:52.540 --> 23:59.840
I made a 390 out of 400 in my Excel class, so I have a very solid A in that class.

23:59.840 --> 24:07.560
Yeah, I made like a hundred on my final and four points on my final project too, so I'm

24:07.560 --> 24:09.240
all happy and excited about that.

24:09.240 --> 24:15.400
That means I have like a 3.2 something GPA for the semester.

24:15.400 --> 24:21.280
I paid 300 and something dollars for my next classes, which kind of sucked, but I was really,

24:21.280 --> 24:24.400
really stressed out all week and really exhausted.

24:24.400 --> 24:27.320
And then finally, Thursday, I just collapsed at work.

24:27.320 --> 24:34.580
I was all, you know, totally lacking in energy, and I ended up going home after half a day.

24:34.580 --> 24:37.880
And then I tried, because I was just really sick.

24:37.880 --> 24:40.980
And then I felt better the next day, so I got up to go back to work and only managed

24:40.980 --> 24:45.260
to stay three hours before I had to come home again.

24:45.260 --> 24:53.940
And I did nothing then but sleep and play fantasy star online for the past three days.

24:53.940 --> 24:54.940
Nothing but that.

24:54.940 --> 25:01.740
so yeah I'm back to playing PSO I'm not an addict so I don't really want to play

25:01.740 --> 25:09.220
anymore for some time I basically once I made it to level 41 in three days we're

25:09.220 --> 25:16.740
trying to get me to ultimate so I have 40 more levels to go anyway that's

25:16.740 --> 25:22.900
really all I did we went to this place called crickets on Auburn yesterday that

25:22.900 --> 25:30.380
my friends were up and down was going to be the best breakfast place ever. It was just

25:30.380 --> 25:37.540
ass. My French toast was just egg and milk on bread. I saw them put plates on top of

25:37.540 --> 25:47.180
full plates of food. It was really disgusting. My potatoes were cold. They were nice there,

25:47.180 --> 25:53.340
But it was just kind of crap so I wouldn't recommend anybody go there, and I'm not going there again

25:53.720 --> 25:56.200
But it made my day really grumpy yesterday

25:56.200 --> 26:00.140
I was really grumpy yesterday until I had a breakfast burrito and that made it all better

26:00.140 --> 26:03.160
And then I played fantasy star online for about six hours

26:04.560 --> 26:07.520
That's all I did PSO and sleep

26:09.960 --> 26:14.620
Sounds very similar to a lot of my screen so it's very similar to a lot of my weekends, but with a different game

26:14.620 --> 26:17.960
Eggnog is so good.

26:17.960 --> 26:22.200
Baskin Robbins eggnog ice cream. And brand name even.

26:22.200 --> 26:27.760
And they have pumpkin pie ice cream too.

26:27.760 --> 26:33.860
This guy's boney ass.

26:33.860 --> 26:38.540
Did you just make the Christmas reindeer poop on your

26:38.540 --> 26:39.580
girlfriend's head?

26:39.580 --> 26:43.460
You need to put that thing on the can.

26:43.460 --> 26:54.820
Go put that on. Oh, make it poop in her mouth. Do it. Make it poop in her mouth. That's hot.

26:54.820 --> 26:59.740
You should have done it on the cam. Poop. Alright, anyway. What great radio. Alright.

26:59.740 --> 27:02.940
It's this little reindeer and in the back it's a jelly bean dispenser. Why do you have

27:02.940 --> 27:06.540
to push it to get it to poop? Oh, you push it down and then it poops out a little jelly

27:06.540 --> 27:10.780
bean. It's really, it's really cute. There it goes. Now you got poop on the floor. Way

27:10.780 --> 27:11.780
Way to go.

27:11.780 --> 27:12.780
Alright.

27:12.780 --> 27:13.780
Angel.

27:13.780 --> 27:14.780
DDR Angel.

27:14.780 --> 27:15.780
How was your week?

27:15.780 --> 27:16.780
How was your day?

27:16.780 --> 27:17.780
Good.

27:17.780 --> 27:24.540
I had finals on Wednesday, and I tried to start my shopping in the middle of the week,

27:24.540 --> 27:30.220
but that thing didn't exactly go so well, so I guess I started on, what, Friday?

27:30.220 --> 27:31.220
Yeah.

27:31.220 --> 27:34.580
I believe it was Friday, or Saturday or something.

27:34.580 --> 27:42.080
Um, I got sucked into the world in which, um, well, at least three of the people in here are hooked into.

27:42.080 --> 27:45.080
Yes, Final Fantasy XI, yay me.

27:45.580 --> 27:47.080
I got my hat!

27:47.080 --> 27:48.080
Yay!

27:48.580 --> 27:51.580
Even I haven't done that fucking Santa hat quest yet.

27:53.080 --> 27:54.580
It's so weird here.

27:56.080 --> 27:59.080
That's okay, I had a bajillion Santa hats on RO.

28:00.580 --> 28:03.080
Are they doing those Christmas wrappy things again?

28:03.080 --> 28:08.520
Yeah, they're doing the Christmas present ones, but I've been trying to get a Christmas

28:08.520 --> 28:13.720
present so I can get the heart of Oppa Oppa, because I have, what Julie gave me to support

28:13.720 --> 28:17.080
my Christmas present on PSO is I have an Oppa Oppa mag.

28:17.080 --> 28:19.640
I'm going to tell you about the nerdiest thing you've ever heard in a little bit about an

28:19.640 --> 28:24.200
online game and Christmas events, but I got to say the Christmas event on Final Fantasy

28:24.200 --> 28:26.040
11 this year, not as good as last year's.

28:26.040 --> 28:27.040
Last year's was awesome.

28:27.040 --> 28:29.880
It was kind of fun on RO going around beating up Santa Claus.

28:29.880 --> 28:32.800
Anyway, sorry Angel to cut you off.

28:32.800 --> 28:39.800
much. The Santa hat thing was the last thing I wanted to say. Oh, the funniest part of

28:40.560 --> 28:47.560
this week, and it happened yesterday, Miklas Hof, AKA Seagurd, totally ran past me in Windows

28:48.680 --> 28:52.400
and he didn't even know it was me and I had to page him. I'm like, hey! He's like, hi!

28:52.400 --> 28:57.120
I'm like, yeah, you just ran past me. He's like, I did? I'm like, yeah, you did. It was

28:57.120 --> 29:00.280
funny. Anyway, whatever. Well, you know, in Popmaster Eleven sometimes if you're in a

29:00.280 --> 29:03.360
crowded area the characters don't load all the same like you know how to take

29:03.360 --> 29:05.240
like if you go into lower to know I don't know if you've been there yet but

29:05.240 --> 29:08.960
there's so many people there that takes a while for a beta load so I spent five

29:08.960 --> 29:14.760
minutes chasing him then he kind of got the hint he's like oh that's cool all

29:14.760 --> 29:19.480
right um moving on let's go over to Loki Loki how is your week how is your day I

29:19.480 --> 29:25.000
know you must have a busy day I'm sorry do we cut you off earlier I'm sorry I

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
have one more thing that happened is that your DS this is my idea how many

29:28.000 --> 29:31.260
freaking people have to bring their DS's to the show? I always keep mine in my laptop

29:31.260 --> 29:35.400
case. Alright, fine. So I can play it at work. Alright. Um, oh yeah, I ordered my Christmas

29:35.400 --> 29:41.980
present from Dan today. Which is? Beat me into the X8 style. Hot. And the Parappa clapping

29:41.980 --> 29:45.320
game. Do you know, do you know I just, we're going to talk about this a little later, but

29:45.320 --> 29:51.360
you could have ordered another game on Playasia which just started taking orders. What? We'll

29:51.360 --> 30:03.200
talk about it in a little bit. Okay. Alright. Alright, anyway, moving on. Loki! Today I

30:03.200 --> 30:13.200
went to my dad's house, and we had food. And, um, what else did I do this week? Oh, I went

30:13.200 --> 30:18.440
to Lemmy's tickets, a series of unfortunate events, and that was awesome. And, I played

30:18.440 --> 30:25.440
Law of Final Fantasy, and Christmas shopping. And, yeah, that's pretty much all I did. Just

30:31.440 --> 30:38.120
Christmas crap, trying to get it done. And then I got some of my gifts. I got clothes

30:38.120 --> 30:45.120
from Nellie, and I got clothes from my sister, and a $100 gift certificate to Target for

30:45.120 --> 30:47.120
Yay money!

31:15.120 --> 31:20.120
I should pass V for the first time ever, but that's nice.

31:20.120 --> 31:24.120
Though I don't know if it's easier timing or whatever.

31:24.120 --> 31:30.120
I'm going to pass Nebula Grasper, but it's the first time I've played it and it killed me the rest of the time.

31:30.120 --> 31:34.120
And, uh, yeah.

31:34.120 --> 31:38.120
Had a Christmas party at work on Friday and stuff.

31:38.120 --> 31:40.120
That's it.

31:40.120 --> 31:42.120
Nothing did that much today.

32:10.120 --> 32:14.540
it was really busy we just went everywhere and you know we were just

32:14.540 --> 32:17.660
busy non-stop and I actually got homework in the class which was kind of

32:17.660 --> 32:19.860
weird considering you know it was training but that's what happens when

32:19.860 --> 32:25.900
you're on salary and then you know Saturday I was hoping to go to the SVGL

32:25.900 --> 32:30.060
3 tournament but I didn't end up going because I was just like so damn tired

32:30.060 --> 32:33.660
and I had to do errands of my parents all this other stuff so I didn't end up

32:33.660 --> 32:39.500
going and I sorry angel because I know you wanted to go but she seems okay with

32:39.500 --> 32:44.260
it. And I'm sorry to everybody out there who was hoping to, or I should say I was hoping

32:44.260 --> 32:51.180
to run into it at Spigle 3. But I just, I got beat out by wanting to sit at home and

32:51.180 --> 32:55.580
just recuperate, so that's exactly what I did. And I played a lot of Final Fantasy 11.

32:55.580 --> 33:00.560
In fact, what ended up happening is that Saturday, here's that nerdy thing I was talking about.

33:00.560 --> 33:04.240
My link shell, Final Fantasy 11, you know that's the group that you belong to, we all

33:04.240 --> 33:08.820
met up and we had a level 1 foot race, which means we took a level 1 character and took

33:08.820 --> 33:12.780
them to the most difficult areas of the game. Well, not the most, but some of the more difficult

33:12.780 --> 33:15.900
areas of the game where you get killed in one hit if you're a level one character. And

33:15.900 --> 33:20.860
we raced from, for those of you that play the game, we raced from Selbina to Juno. It

33:20.860 --> 33:25.860
was pretty cool. And I was winning for a little bit there, and then I made a bad decision

33:25.860 --> 33:30.700
on a path to go, and I came in third. But I made it alive. Loki did not make it alive,

33:30.700 --> 33:31.700
I would just like to point out.

33:31.700 --> 33:34.700
I was in the lead. I was in the lead, so I got taken out.

33:34.700 --> 33:38.700
Yeah, he said he was in the lead, so he got taken out.

33:38.700 --> 33:43.700
And then we had, get this, a Final Fantasy XI gift exchange.

33:43.700 --> 33:47.700
Once we all got to Juno. We all had a secret person we were supposed to buy gifts for,

33:47.700 --> 33:50.700
so we had a secret Santa in Final Fantasy XI.

33:50.700 --> 33:55.700
And I got a plus one silver hairpin and a dagger.

33:55.700 --> 33:58.700
That is the nerdiest thing, isn't it?

33:58.700 --> 34:03.260
I didn't get anything you know what actually I know you did and I think I

34:03.260 --> 34:08.100
know who has you too but it's just that our little shell master or I shouldn't

34:08.100 --> 34:11.660
say shell master but event organizer because Loki's the shell master but our

34:11.660 --> 34:15.620
event organizer needs to get up off her ass and get the rest of the gifts

34:15.620 --> 34:20.580
distributed to those that weren't here so that's what will happen all right

34:20.580 --> 34:25.980
anyway so that's my nerdy final fantasy 11 story what can I say all right

34:25.980 --> 34:29.980
Anybody else have anything they want to add about their week, their day, anything like that?

34:29.980 --> 34:33.980
I got new contacts. New contacts! Are they a different color? They don't look like it.

34:33.980 --> 34:37.980
Well, they're not

34:37.980 --> 34:41.980
tinted because they're not Acubutes now. They got some different kind that

34:41.980 --> 34:45.980
helps correct for Acetagamism or something. Okay, so is everything a little

34:45.980 --> 34:49.980
clearer now? Well, better than when I had those glasses.

34:49.980 --> 34:53.980
How many fingers am I holding up?

34:53.980 --> 35:00.980
Alright. I'll give it back to you. I got it back, alright.

35:00.980 --> 35:07.460
Uh, anyway. We're such great radio. This is great. What have we done tonight that's been

35:07.460 --> 35:11.340
great radio bits? How many fingers am I holding up? That's a great radio bit. Uh, poop in

35:11.340 --> 35:14.020
my mouth, that's a really good radio bit. Pick-a-Chat!

35:14.020 --> 35:23.020
Pick-o-Chat? That's a really great radio event. Let's play Radio Charades. This, this is why

35:23.020 --> 35:30.020
this is why they laugh at our faces at E3 and go, ha, internet radio for games, you

35:30.540 --> 35:37.540
losers. Yeah, I'm going to poop in your mouth at E3, alright, I see how you like it. Alright,

35:38.860 --> 35:44.700
we have some big Bawani news this week. It involves a little series you know of games

35:44.700 --> 35:51.180
called Beat Mania 2DX, you might be familiar with that. Night Style has been announced,

35:51.180 --> 35:52.600
it's coming

35:52.600 --> 35:54.400
and more details on that

35:54.400 --> 35:59.280
after this break featuring some music from the 2DX night style

35:59.280 --> 36:06.280
We'll be back after this.

36:29.280 --> 36:32.280
Lord, who the fuck is this?

36:32.280 --> 36:35.280
You're also nothing to fear

36:35.280 --> 36:38.280
Or die

36:38.280 --> 36:40.280
I can't lie, I'm a killer

36:40.280 --> 36:45.280
I am a naked guy

36:45.280 --> 36:47.280
I can't lie, I'm a killer

36:47.280 --> 36:52.280
I am a naked guy

36:52.280 --> 36:55.280
Even though they're gonna see that I

39:55.280 --> 40:23.280
One more time for the bad boys, babe One more time for the bad boys, babe

41:23.280 --> 41:33.680

Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

42:21.060 --> 42:27.560
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and we've been playing PictoChat during the break

42:27.560 --> 42:31.960
because we're such dorks, I don't really have a better explanation other than that. But

42:31.960 --> 42:35.880
if you've been keeping an eye on our webcam, www.orangeloungeradio.com, I did put up a

42:35.880 --> 42:39.200
picture of the pooping reindeer during the break there, as well as a little glimpse of

42:39.200 --> 42:44.360
PictoChat. Wait, what'd you find out, Ellie?

42:44.360 --> 42:47.180
I think you shoved the poop right back up their ass.

42:47.180 --> 42:54.180
you shove the poop back in their ass? Force it in like this. This is like a poop enema.

42:54.660 --> 43:00.660
Why don't you go back to Loki's room and see what else you can shove up there? Get your

43:00.660 --> 43:07.380
hands robbed. Go to hell. Alright, anyway, as we alluded to before we went to the break

43:07.380 --> 43:13.700
there, we do have BeatMania 2DX9 style somewhat announced for release, and I say somewhat

43:13.700 --> 43:17.440
announced because basically all they really have to go off of right now, I should say

43:17.440 --> 43:22.360
all we really have to go off of right now is a website that Konami of Japan has. It's

43:22.360 --> 43:27.100
actually Konami Broadcasting and they have this page which appears to be listing some

43:27.100 --> 43:33.080
of their new releases and on May, I'm sorry, March 24th of 2005, they have listed Beat

43:33.080 --> 43:39.520
Mania 2DX 9th Style, which means 9th Style looks like that's all we need is confirmation

43:39.520 --> 43:41.960
and the ninth style will be coming out at home for sure,

43:41.960 --> 43:45.080
which is really good because basically we've had, what,

43:45.080 --> 43:47.320
seventh style, eighth style, and now ninth style

43:47.320 --> 43:49.540
all within, I mean, we had to go, like, a long time,

43:49.540 --> 43:51.020
like, probably, what, a year and a half

43:51.020 --> 43:52.920
with no new 2DX releases, at least?

43:52.920 --> 43:55.120
And then suddenly seventh style, eighth style, ninth style,

43:55.120 --> 43:56.880
and probably tenth style are all gonna come out

43:56.880 --> 43:58.080
back to back to back.

43:58.080 --> 44:00.500
So, well, not back to back, literally,

44:00.500 --> 44:02.560
but, you know, within a pretty good distance of each other.

44:02.560 --> 44:03.560
So this is pretty exciting.

44:03.560 --> 44:07.840
So are you guys excited about this news,

44:07.840 --> 44:12.580
So what do you, what does this make you, what do you think about, you have to come stand

44:12.580 --> 44:13.580
on a mic, Jamie.

44:13.580 --> 44:15.860
What do you think of this news, Angel?

44:15.860 --> 44:19.660
Um, well, I like it.

44:19.660 --> 44:20.660
Obviously.

44:20.660 --> 44:23.020
Jamie is back to present her opinion.

44:23.020 --> 44:26.460
As long as it doesn't have the shit timing problems.

44:26.460 --> 44:30.820
You know, as long as it's not that problem, then it's cool.

44:30.820 --> 44:34.140
It'd be an improvement over the arcade.

44:34.140 --> 44:38.140
So basically, sorry, we're having a little bit of sound issues here, those same problems

44:38.140 --> 44:41.820
I was talking about when the show started with the stripped wires causing us to have

44:41.820 --> 44:43.340
a little bit of issue here.

44:43.340 --> 44:45.380
We're going to get that recorder placed for next week.

44:45.380 --> 44:46.380
Sorry guys.

44:46.380 --> 44:50.340
Oh, I think I see exactly where the problem is too.

44:50.340 --> 44:51.340
Play nice!

44:51.340 --> 44:52.340
Anyway, yes.

44:52.340 --> 45:00.020
So, obviously, 2DX and the arcade had a little bit of timing problems, and I think the question

45:00.020 --> 45:05.780
on everybody's mind is, is it going to be fixed for the home release or would they keep

45:05.780 --> 45:10.420
it arcade accurate so that people who practice at home can take it to the arcade or what's

45:10.420 --> 45:15.140
going to happen? I don't know. Any thoughts from a technical perspective, Loki? I know

45:15.140 --> 45:17.700
you probably don't even care about this game, but you know, I just thought I'd get your

45:17.700 --> 45:24.140
opinion anyway. That would be an accurate assumption. Okay, then tell me what you think.

45:24.140 --> 45:31.560
Well, that's a new game, yay. I have a pretzel.

45:31.560 --> 45:35.920
So, the timing problems in Ninth Style are enough to make you despise this game, Jamie,

45:35.920 --> 45:38.920
or what's the deal?

45:38.920 --> 45:43.960
Well, after seeing how bad the timing problems were, I swore I'd never play Ninth Style,

45:43.960 --> 45:44.960
and I haven't.

45:44.960 --> 45:47.500
But do you think you're going to make an exception for the home release?

45:47.500 --> 45:51.760
If the home release doesn't have the timing problems, then I'll buy it.

45:51.760 --> 45:57.040
enough all right um I just know I'm looking forward to with night style the

45:57.040 --> 46:01.080
new songs because night style has probably one of my favorite song lists

46:01.080 --> 46:07.520
of any 2dx style really I think it had my most favorite song list since at least

46:07.520 --> 46:11.720
six style probably maybe since fifth I don't know but nice I had just so many

46:11.720 --> 46:15.160
great songs on it that I love and I can't wait to play it at home because I

46:15.160 --> 46:17.960
really only played night style in the arcade myself personally I think I only

46:17.960 --> 46:23.440
played 9th style in the arcade like one time, two times? I think two times is the most times

46:23.440 --> 46:28.000
I played 9th style in the arcade. And really when I went and played 10th style, I pretty

46:28.000 --> 46:32.520
much only played 9th style songs. I was kind of one of those losers that just played those.

46:32.520 --> 46:37.520
I played Gradius. Well I mean, that's a 10th style song though, that's not a 9th style

46:37.520 --> 46:43.960
song. I just couldn't play on that 10th style machine. I'm excited because since we had

46:43.960 --> 46:48.880
so many consumer songs and I don't mess with the sound right now cuz we're wait

46:48.880 --> 46:57.040
for a break we had so many new songs on consumer style eight that's gonna be

46:57.040 --> 47:01.680
interesting to see if we get as many on night style as well

47:01.680 --> 47:05.480
do you guys hoping to see a lot of new consumer tracks or you just want it to

47:05.480 --> 47:11.200
be arcade accurate bring back a lot of old songs or what any feelings on that I

47:11.200 --> 47:14.200
I wanted to have no timing problems.

47:14.200 --> 47:17.200
I wanted to play like 8th Style.

47:17.200 --> 47:20.200
You don't care what the hell's in it as long as it's...

47:20.200 --> 47:22.200
As long as it has no timing problems.

47:22.200 --> 47:24.200
Because I want to play Lion Suki.

47:24.200 --> 47:31.200
I want to see more of the ghetto fabulous dancers like in that one song, the 8th Style consumer song that has...

47:31.200 --> 47:33.200
I miss the 4th Style booty dancers.

47:33.200 --> 47:34.200
Bring those back?

47:34.200 --> 47:36.200
The Geary Geary Daddy dancers.

47:36.200 --> 47:42.440
it look like the fembots in the one video? Oh god. Can't remember any of the song. Somebody

47:42.440 --> 47:46.240
will get it. I don't know. I'm just happy that my 8th style is going to be here at the

47:46.240 --> 47:51.240
end of the week. So I can play the answer. So as you were saying before, you went ahead

47:51.240 --> 47:55.760
and you ordered your 8th style. Yeah. Well you know I got a little private message in

47:55.760 --> 48:01.040
the chat room over here saying DarkLionXVI says that actually over on Playasia right

48:01.040 --> 48:05.840
now you can pre-order 9th style if you're so inclined. I'm not going to pre-order it

48:05.840 --> 48:10.200
until I know that the issues are fixed.

48:10.200 --> 48:12.600
Don't Be Afraid Myself is what they're saying it is.

48:12.600 --> 48:13.600
I don't think that's it.

48:13.600 --> 48:16.000
It was like Love Something was the name of the song.

48:16.000 --> 48:18.400
Don't Be Afraid Myself had the girls dancing in the bathroom.

48:18.400 --> 48:23.960
That's the one that's like the, I don't know, the pop video.

48:23.960 --> 48:27.800
I'm talking about the one that had the- They were dancing in a damn locker room shower.

48:27.800 --> 48:29.840
Yeah, that's not the one I'm thinking of.

48:29.840 --> 48:34.080
I'm thinking of the one where they're all dressed up in the hippie stuff and they were

48:34.080 --> 48:40.400
driving through Tokyo and stuff, or something. Why can't I think of the name of that song?

48:40.400 --> 48:46.120
I'm looking it up right now because I'm so pissed I can't think of what that song is.

48:46.120 --> 48:51.760
Love Box. Love Box. That's the song I was trying to think of. It's got a pretty dirty

48:51.760 --> 49:02.300
title. Yeah, Nelly's snickering over there. He said box. Alright. Anyway, so most folks

49:02.300 --> 49:05.300
are going to be pretty excited about Nine Style. Of course, as soon as we know more

49:05.300 --> 49:10.780
information about the game, we will be presenting it to you guys. And it's funny looking in

49:10.780 --> 49:16.420
the chat room, they're going, love box, love box, fucking love box, god damn. You have

49:16.420 --> 49:21.220
to remember guys, you're on a buffer. You're about 34 or 35 seconds behind everything,

49:21.220 --> 49:28.100
so losers. Alright, I guess what we'll do is we're going to take another quick break

49:28.100 --> 49:30.240
because it looks like we're working on some sound issues here. We're going to do a quick

49:30.240 --> 49:35.520
break, some more 2DX9-style songs since we're so excited about this, and when we come back,

49:35.520 --> 49:39.040
maybe we'll take some calls over the Skypline. Also, at some point tonight, we gotta do a

49:39.040 --> 49:44.320
new list list. We have to have a cage match tonight, at some point, and we'll listen to

49:44.320 --> 49:49.680
Jamie Belch some more. I'm sorry, it's your fault, you gave me the soda. Oh right, you're

49:49.680 --> 49:52.860
right. This is the best stuff in the world. You're right, it's all my fault. Sugar-free

49:52.860 --> 49:59.860
Alright, we'll be back after this you guys.

50:52.860 --> 50:54.860
Let's go!

51:52.860 --> 51:59.860
We'll be right back after some more music here on Orange Launch Radio.

52:22.860 --> 52:24.860
Yay!

53:52.860 --> 53:53.360
Survey

53:53.360 --> 53:53.860
Survey

53:53.860 --> 53:54.140

And

54:14.140 --> 54:16.640
And

54:18.640 --> 54:19.620
And

54:21.220 --> 54:21.720
I

55:51.720 --> 56:12.480
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and it looks like we actually fixed some of the

56:12.480 --> 56:16.660
sound. We replaced the cord, so Logie was kind enough to do a little switcheroo there

56:16.660 --> 56:21.260
during the break, swap the cord out, so hopefully that'll minimize those sound issues we've

56:21.260 --> 56:24.420
been having. I notice the buzz is still there a little bit, but it doesn't sound as bad

56:24.420 --> 56:31.420
in my monitor here, so we'll see. Thank God! Alright. Hooray for Loki! This is why we call

56:31.420 --> 56:35.980
him the tech master. In the chatroom during that break, they were complaining, or I shouldn't

56:35.980 --> 56:39.140
say complaining, but they were talking about some of the different night-style songs. You

56:39.140 --> 56:42.220
have a favorite night-style song, even though the timing pushes you off, is there a favorite

56:42.220 --> 56:47.740
night-style song you have? All of the Taku songs. Like, what, Distress and Lower World?

56:47.740 --> 56:56.540
I'd have to say it actually distresses the best, and of course I do like Lianski.

56:56.540 --> 56:59.580
My favorite song in 9th Style is Power Dream, because I love ping pong.

56:59.580 --> 57:05.260
There is another one that I liked, but I don't remember the name of it, because I didn't

57:05.260 --> 57:06.880
really keep up too much with 9th Style.

57:06.880 --> 57:10.700
And of course Bad Boy Bass.

57:10.700 --> 57:15.500
Everyone is something, I don't remember the song.

57:15.500 --> 57:20.300
Alright. What we're going to do now is we're actually going to talk to somebody over the

57:20.300 --> 57:24.620
Skype line. Somebody actually called and said they had something they wanted to talk to

57:24.620 --> 57:29.380
us about, so we're going to go ahead and pick up the Skype line here. I just told them to

57:29.380 --> 57:32.220
give us a call here. Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

57:32.220 --> 57:36.300
Hey, what's up? Hi, and who is this?

57:36.300 --> 57:38.580
It's Sherlock. Hi, Sherlock. How are you?

57:38.580 --> 57:43.180
Doing good. How are you doing today? I'm good. For those of you folks who don't

57:43.180 --> 57:47.580
know, Sherlock, one of the moderators over on DDR Freak, which by the way, DDR Freak,

57:47.580 --> 57:50.300
kind enough to replay Orange Lawn's radio Friday nights.

57:50.300 --> 57:55.580
And he has the best hat ever. The hat is pretty sexy.

57:55.580 --> 57:57.900
Is it now? I've seen pictures of the hat, and I think

57:57.900 --> 58:04.580
I saw the hat from a distance at E3, but it was kind of like going to a rock concert,

58:04.580 --> 58:08.580
and it's like, you know, I think I can kind of make it out. I think I can kind of make

58:08.580 --> 58:11.060
out that person. It's all, you can almost see it.

58:11.060 --> 58:14.980
You can almost see it. What's on your mind, Sherlock?

58:14.980 --> 58:19.500
I found something online that kinda confused me a bit, but it also made me

58:19.500 --> 58:22.460
just like spin my head, and it really

58:22.460 --> 58:26.220
just threw me for a turn. It's DDR-related, and uh...

58:26.220 --> 58:29.460
A lot of DDR things kinda make me question myself sometimes, but...

58:29.460 --> 58:33.140
Yeah, I mean, you know, everyone keeps talking about, you know, is DDR dead,

58:33.140 --> 58:36.140
what's going on, you know, the whole April Fools thing, you know,

58:36.140 --> 58:39.920
put everyone in for a turn, but something came up

58:39.920 --> 58:46.080
that really confused me. If you guys go to the Konami Arcade website for DDR Extreme,

58:46.080 --> 58:53.160
it's konami.co.jp slash am slash ddr underscore new. Brings you up to the DDR website for

58:53.160 --> 58:54.160
DR Extreme.

58:54.160 --> 58:58.440
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Run that by me one more time. Konami.co.jp slash...

58:58.440 --> 59:05.600
Am slash ddr slash ddr new.

59:05.600 --> 59:07.960
Slash ddr new. All right.

59:07.960 --> 59:17.960
Yes, it's the Xtreme webpage, and if you look at it, the logo up top has a little Santa Claus logo in it.

59:17.960 --> 59:26.960
Now, what I'm trying to figure out is why they decided to update a two-year-old webpage with a little Santa Claus logo.

59:26.960 --> 59:29.960
Okay, Loki's tapping me and he says it's what?

59:29.960 --> 59:35.960
That's fucking old, that's from like last time. That was back when they were talking about the original DDR stream coming out.

59:35.960 --> 59:38.280
Santa Claus has been there all the time.

59:38.280 --> 59:40.560
No it hasn't, not that I remember.

59:40.560 --> 59:43.560
It's been there, trust me.

59:43.560 --> 59:45.360
I've never seen that there before.

59:45.360 --> 59:47.280
Interesting, okay now,

59:47.280 --> 59:50.400
but I do remember that Extreme came out

59:50.400 --> 59:54.440
at Christmas time. I do remember that. Extreme came out Christmas day in

59:54.440 --> 59:56.060
2002, didn't it?

59:56.060 --> 59:57.620
I want to say.

59:57.620 --> 59:58.800
Loki think,

59:58.800 --> 01:00:01.240
Loki swears up and down it's been there the whole time.

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:04.040
It hasn't been, no.

01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:06.560
Why would they keep it there over summer?

01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:12.500
Well, I mean, but isn't, yeah, this is the journal of Naoki Madaya and stuff, why would

01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:15.220
they bother to update this? I don't know.

01:00:15.220 --> 01:00:17.180
I, you, Mel?

01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:19.800
I don't know. I just, I wish I'd visited...

01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:21.700
No, it's not the same, it's not the same and I'll tell you why.

01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:25.020
Okay. Because the image name is

01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:28.220
ddrex2.gif

01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:29.020
and then

01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:30.580
well, if you view the image

01:00:30.580 --> 01:00:32.520
If you take out the two

01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:36.280
yeah if you take out the two there's the original logo

01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:38.480
mmm so

01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:40.240
well but when did the journal... okay

01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:42.760
loki, loki's getting frustrated

01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:43.920
because

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:47.280
that was like one of the last journals that they did on there and they changed the logo for the

01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:48.520
last journal

01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:49.980
ddr-ex

01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:53.800
the uh... ex-one or whatever is for the previous journals in that series there

01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:56.380
cause there's multiple page for that journal so

01:00:56.380 --> 01:00:59.320
i know there is but i don't know

01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:03.200
old it's not anything new it's old

01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:06.860
lucky quit ruining christmas teases

01:01:06.860 --> 01:01:09.960
get the boy hope for this holiday season

01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:12.640
the hell's wrong with you you bridge

01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:16.140
all right fine if you want to go ahead and do that if you look at that picture

01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:20.040
through a set of doctors a secret code in their case to a secret website it's

01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:23.960
all about the background information of the vr e x two

01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:29.760
Really? There you go, there's your conspiracy theory for the year. Is it purple?

01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:35.120
It's not purple, it's Fuchsia!

01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:41.440
Are you going to argue with me about colors now? Come on, it was purple.

01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:43.400
Everybody knows

01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:44.560
that it's going to be

01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:51.240
DDR Fuchsia. That's the new, it's like 2DX Red, DDR Fuchsia, okay? Trust me on this.

01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:52.500
I've got to know!

01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:53.840
Okay, I found the code!

01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:57.560
Can we color a little bit less homosexual? Come on!

01:01:57.560 --> 01:01:59.040
Hey, please!

01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:03.400
Fine, if you really want to know what the color is, it's Super Fuchsia, but you know,

01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:07.480
I'm not one to judge their title, okay? I don't get it.

01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:13.920
Because the homosexual one would be Fabulous Fuchsia.

01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:16.000
Alright, well thank you, you know what?

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.140
Either way, maybe...

01:02:18.140 --> 01:02:22.140
I guess you just have to believe in Santa Claus if you want this to be true.

01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:26.140
I believe that little Santa Claus in the logo, alright?

01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:30.140
Just click your heels three times and swear you believe.

01:02:30.140 --> 01:02:36.140
I sincerely hope that you're onto something. I hope Loki's full of shit, but I unfortunately don't think he is in this case.

01:02:36.140 --> 01:02:37.140
I hope so too.

01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:39.140
I hope he is, but I unfortunately don't think he is in this case.

01:02:39.140 --> 01:02:44.140
I haven't heard anyone else say otherwise, so Loki's the first one to say something wrong.

01:02:44.140 --> 01:02:47.140
When he says it, he says it loud. Don't let that scare you.

01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:48.140
Alright.

01:02:48.140 --> 01:02:53.140
Alright, well thanks for the tip Sherlock. How are you doing otherwise?

01:02:53.140 --> 01:02:56.140
Uh, life's had its ups and downs.

01:02:56.140 --> 01:03:02.140
How's DDR in New York? We don't hear a whole lot about what's going on in New York because we're in California.

01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:07.140
Oh God, don't get me started. Don't get me started. We had to lock the forums like two weeks back.

01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:10.140
I'm not talking about the intro web drama.

01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:11.140
The intro web?

01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:13.140
How's the scene going?

01:03:13.140 --> 01:03:17.140
The scene itself? Not much better, I'll give you that.

01:03:17.140 --> 01:03:19.140
Oh, that's a bummer.

01:03:19.140 --> 01:03:24.140
Go out there with some defibrillators and breathe some life into DDR a little bit.

01:03:24.140 --> 01:03:28.140
It's not changing, nothing's changed around here at all.

01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:31.140
Sherlock, go spread the Santa rumor all around, they'll all buy it.

01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:33.140
I will, I will, I'm going to.

01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:34.140
Alright, you do that.

01:03:34.140 --> 01:03:35.140
Yeah.

01:03:35.140 --> 01:03:38.140
Alright, thanks for calling Sherlock, have a good one.

01:03:38.140 --> 01:03:39.140
You too.

01:03:39.140 --> 01:03:40.140
Later.

01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:46.140
Wait, hold on. It said you heard it here first, DDR Fuchsia.

01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:48.140
Oh my god, DDR Fuchsia.

01:03:48.140 --> 01:03:51.140
Alright, DDR Fuchsia.

01:03:51.140 --> 01:03:54.140
Well, I'm glad Sherlock decided to call the show.

01:03:54.140 --> 01:04:02.140
Even if he may be chasing a ghost, not unlike one of our co-hosts here on the show.

01:04:02.140 --> 01:04:07.140
No, he's just chasing nothing. Sorry.

01:04:07.140 --> 01:04:13.860
it's been there okay it's been there forever ever and ever still a cringe

01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:19.460
all right anyway moving on I want to do a little bit of a follow-up to something

01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:23.160
we were talking about last week Jamie this has to do with something you

01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:27.420
brought up and it's the the girl the little girl that killed the other little

01:04:27.420 --> 01:04:31.820
girl and now has the internet obsession going on about her yeah I have a banner

01:04:31.820 --> 01:04:36.100
for it yeah I just I was gonna bring that up they help is that you to go and

01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:41.520
make a banner and a match. For those that didn't catch last week's show, just a little

01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:42.520
catch up.

01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:43.520
I'll put a link to it in the chat room.

01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:48.100
Okay. Give us the Cliff Notes version. What's going on here? What happened and why is there

01:04:48.100 --> 01:04:50.100
an internet obsession about it?

01:04:50.100 --> 01:04:57.880
Okay. There was a girl who killed one of her classmates. In a class picture, this little

01:04:57.880 --> 01:05:03.140
girl was wearing a University of Nevada sweatshirt. It just says Nevada all the way across. It's

01:05:03.140 --> 01:05:08.820
a blue sweatshirt, and there's all indications that they were friends and everything, so

01:05:08.820 --> 01:05:18.540
anyway, it started this whole big internet obsession, and people, and keep in mind, they're

01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:22.740
doing her as a character, not as she herself.

01:05:22.740 --> 01:05:29.680
And because she was 12 years old, they couldn't prosecute her, because the age of criminal

01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:37.040
responsibility in Japan is 14, which was actually lowered to 14 because of another child murder.

01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:44.520
Anyway, there's tons of fan art now, tons and tons of fan art. I took one of the pictures

01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:50.120
and made a banner out of it. You know how when people that want to be fashionable

01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:55.080
with their banners online, they have the banner and then they have the matching little avatar

01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:58.960
that goes with it, the little box that sits under the name? What I liked about what Jamie

01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:02.720
didn't. Not only does she have this going on on DDR Freak, but she has it going on on

01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:05.720
the Orange Lodge Radio Forums, as well as probably every other forum out there right

01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:10.520
now that she frequents. She's got the little banner that has the little Nevada girl on

01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:14.360
it, and it says Dark Sakura. And then the little avatar is the little box cutter.

01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:19.460
It's actually from the same picture, because I wanted to get the whole thing of her holding

01:06:19.460 --> 01:06:23.840
the box cutter, but it didn't, the size didn't reduce the way I liked it, too. So I said,

01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:27.440
did, you know, just her holding the box cutter. And I'm going to post them in the chat room.

01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:31.860
Alright, you do that. You post it in chat. Or, you could check it out for yourself. Just

01:06:31.860 --> 01:06:36.560
go to the Orange Lounge Radio forums, and there should be a post from Jamie in there.

01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:42.640
I have to give a cheap advertisement in there somewhere, for people to visit our dying forums.

01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:48.960
Alright. Anyway, I want the quote thread to evolve.

01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:55.680
In order for the quote thread to come back, people have to actually use our chat room,

01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:56.680
don't you think?

01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:57.680
I agree.

01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:58.680
Which is pretty active.

01:06:58.680 --> 01:06:59.680
So use it already!

01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:00.680
Geez!

01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:04.320
Which is pretty active during the live shows, I can't complain about that, but, damn, during

01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:08.500
the week it's a ghost town, of course, I'm pretty bad, because instead of chatting in

01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:12.480
Orange Lounge like I should, I'm playing Final Fantasy XI.

01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:16.200
Which is funny, Angel was mouthing that right along with me, like I was at the Rocky Horror

01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:20.680
Picture Show or something, she was mouthing it along, because she knew I was going to

01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:21.680
say that.

01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:22.680
I'm dicked!

01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:23.680
You are an addict!

01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:25.180
I am so glad I quit that game.

01:07:25.180 --> 01:07:27.360
I have PSO now.

01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:29.360
I'm sad that you quit, just so you know.

01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:30.500
Well, you know what?

01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:32.780
How about for Christmas you pay for me to play again?

01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:34.660
I'm kidding.

01:07:34.660 --> 01:07:35.980
Yeah, how about that gift card?

01:07:35.980 --> 01:07:37.940
How about that Pooping Ranger?

01:07:37.940 --> 01:07:41.260
You know, I actually did have half of the temptation

01:07:41.260 --> 01:07:43.540
to reinstall it.

01:07:43.540 --> 01:07:44.440
Temptation's good.

01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:46.500
And then I thought, why?

01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:48.660
I won't have time.

01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:51.540
Once the school year starts again, the semester starts.

01:07:51.540 --> 01:07:55.060
When you get really addicted like me, you make time.

01:07:55.060 --> 01:07:58.380
That's what I have the gym for.

01:07:58.380 --> 01:07:59.340
Oh, snap.

01:07:59.340 --> 01:08:02.020
That's my addiction is exercise.

01:08:02.020 --> 01:08:06.340
My addiction is feeling fit.

01:08:06.340 --> 01:08:09.540
I like endorphins. You need to take me to the gym sometime.

01:08:09.540 --> 01:08:12.700
I want to see what this is all about. Okay.

01:08:12.700 --> 01:08:14.460
Sometime.

01:08:14.460 --> 01:08:20.300
Let's have ourselves a cage match, shall we? Why not?

01:08:20.300 --> 01:08:23.020
Alright, the way the Orange Launch Radio cage match works,

01:08:23.020 --> 01:08:27.020
We play three songs for you guys, and you guys pick your favorite song.

01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:31.020
The winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:38.020
Each host picks a song, and you get to hear a clip of last week's winner, as well as two brand new songs.

01:08:38.020 --> 01:08:42.020
Last week in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage match, it came down to The Wire.

01:08:42.020 --> 01:08:46.020
It was incredibly insane. It was a three-way tie.

01:08:46.020 --> 01:08:51.020
A three-way tie, and it was three new songs because we had to retire a song last week.

01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:56.840
so DDR Angel ended up breaking the tie and a lot of folks in the chat room very

01:08:56.840 --> 01:09:00.680
passionate about their dislike for this song so it's gonna have a hard time

01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:06.080
holding on tonight but we'll see we'll see maybe maybe people will see

01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:09.760
something in the song tonight that they didn't see before I don't know but here

01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:14.120
it is song number one you can vote for tonight it's the artist called J punch

01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:17.120
and the song is called Bitch. Enjoy!

01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:50.120
I can't get clean, that's right

01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:53.120
You are a bitch

01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:01.120
And I hate myself

01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:04.120
That's right

01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:09.120
You are a bitch

01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:11.120
You are a bitch

01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:30.120
And I hate myself

01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:35.120
And I tried

01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:42.120
She gave it all up in her bed, she gave it all up in her bed, she gave it all up in her bed

01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:25.000
All right, that was song number one in tonight's cage match, Bitch, by J-Punch, and it looks

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:29.360
like the chat room is about ready to take their handguns to that song.

01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:30.360
They're bitching!

01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:31.360
Yeah, they're bitching.

01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:33.360
You're so funny, Jamie!

01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:41.320
All right, let's see what's going to try and knock this bitch out of here tonight.

01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:43.320
We'll start it off with Dark Sakura's pick.

01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:45.320
I picked an overclocked mix.

01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:49.320
This is good because we were talking about overclocks a little bit last week,

01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:52.320
and how Loki is going to submit his remix any day now, right?

01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:54.320
Uh, no I'm not actually.

01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:57.320
Oh, what caused this change? Hold on, hold on.

01:11:57.320 --> 01:11:59.320
What caused the change?

01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:06.320
It doesn't, it's not, no, it's not the type of remix to be on that site, sorry, that's it, period.

01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:09.320
No discussion, it's not going up there.

01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:12.320
He is not going to compromise his art.

01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:15.320
Anyway, back to what we were talking about here.

01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:18.320
I just realized there's a lot of crap on Overclocked, though.

01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:21.320
A lot of really crappy remixes.

01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:22.320
But not this song, right?

01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:27.320
No. This one's a remix from Raiden 2, which is one of my favorite shooter games of all time.

01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:33.320
Actually, my favorite in the series is Raiden DX, but Raiden 2 was the first one that had these electric things.

01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:38.840
big purple line that shoots out and latches on to people and zooms around

01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:42.520
them and I was like that was the coolest weapon in a shooting game ever. Next to

01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:47.540
the fist in Twinbee so I had to download that and it actually turned out to be a

01:12:47.540 --> 01:12:51.540
pretty cool one so I don't remember the name that they named it but it's

01:12:51.540 --> 01:12:56.320
something from Raiden 2. I'll give you a hint the artist is TefNek and the

01:12:56.320 --> 01:13:00.440
song is called the Raiden 2 Airborne Overclock Mix. How's that sound?

01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:07.440
I keep thinking Mortal Kombat sense Raiden, or Fatal Fury for that same spelling.

01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:14.440
All right, here it is. TefNec Raiden 2 Airborne OC Remix. Enjoy.

01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:52.880
Okay, song number two in tonight's cage match was Teth-Neck, Raiden II, Airborne.

01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:55.240
It's a remix coming to you from Overclocked.

01:17:55.240 --> 01:17:59.160
Let's see if that song overclocked or underclocked with the judges here in the room.

01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:01.160
What do you think, Jamie?

01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:05.680
Well, I liked it, obviously, or else I wouldn't have picked it, so it gets a nine for me.

01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:06.680
All right, fair enough.

01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:13.680
I think I've heard it before actually, um, get the nate.

01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:20.200
Um, Marcanium 42. Can't hear you bud, is your mic on?

01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:22.200
Can't hear you though, did you go to the bottom there?

01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:27.360
Eh, I don't know. Oh, he may not have plugged it back in.

01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:34.040
Let's come back to you, Angel? Uh, I liked it, I'll give it a nate.

01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:39.420
I thought the song was, it was very fluffy, flying on the clouds type thing, I don't know

01:18:39.420 --> 01:18:44.620
if it's the song I'd go like, yeah, rock on, this song, but it's cute. It's definitely

01:18:44.620 --> 01:18:51.220
video game ambiance type music, so I give it like a, nah, an eight, why not. Now we

01:18:51.220 --> 01:18:53.880
can hear you, Arcadian. Alright, where would you give that one?

01:18:53.880 --> 01:18:56.420
It was alright. I'll give it an eight.

01:18:56.420 --> 01:18:59.960
Alright, an eight from Arcadian as well. Remember though, it's not up to us, it's up to you

01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:05.240
guys in the chatroom at www.orangeslaundry.com and chat. You guys get the final say. Loki,

01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:12.120
it's your turn. What song did you pick for us tonight? Let me give them a second try.

01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:21.120
This is Monolithic with House of Joy, off of their newest CD, Diving the Sunfish. Alright,

01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:28.160
more time giving them a try here in the cage match monolithic house of joy enjoy

01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:49.120
Oh, come this morning, turn on the TV.

01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:53.120
Turned on the TV

01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:56.120
And what did you see?

01:20:56.120 --> 01:21:00.120
The calamity

01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:03.120
Anger inside you

01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:06.120
Swelled up unrestrained

01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:09.120
The picture they burn

01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:14.120
Like a torch to your brain

01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:18.120
What happened to the world you knew?

01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:20.120
Where's the world at?

01:21:20.120 --> 01:21:24.120
You feel the light no longer shines on you

01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:27.120
Like the night of observation

01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:31.120
You think the world pounds upon your back

01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:33.120
It's beating on my back

01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:38.120
Like your life spreads you to the rack

01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:42.120
Left you to die

01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:46.120
There is no one left

01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:53.120
You remember

01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:59.120
You hold the key to the high store

01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:06.120
Enter and seek out your sorrow

01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:11.020
Here is the key to the house

01:22:11.020 --> 01:22:17.420
You're coming and build your tomorrow

01:22:17.420 --> 01:22:25.540
Is rage for you

01:22:25.540 --> 01:22:53.540
You don't have a lot of money.

01:22:53.540 --> 01:22:57.540
You don't have any love in your hands

01:22:59.540 --> 01:23:03.540
You don't laugh anymore with this body

01:23:06.540 --> 01:23:10.540
You think it'd be better if God liked what he had

01:23:10.540 --> 01:23:39.540
You hold the key to the house, You're a war-hinter and lead by your God.

01:23:39.540 --> 01:23:48.540
Tomorrow, here is the key to the hardcore

01:23:48.540 --> 01:23:53.540
Come in and feel your tomorrow

01:23:53.540 --> 01:24:01.540
It waits for you

01:24:01.540 --> 01:24:08.540
Then the silence you reach

01:24:08.540 --> 01:24:13.540
I'll be waiting for you

01:24:13.540 --> 01:24:20.540
I'll be waiting for you

01:24:20.540 --> 01:24:25.540
I'll be waiting for you

01:24:25.540 --> 01:24:50.740
You hold a key to the house, your war is here, and these are your sorrows, here is a key

01:24:50.740 --> 01:24:55.040
To the hardcore

01:24:55.040 --> 01:24:59.640
Come in and build your tomorrow

01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:03.040
It waits for you

01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:08.040
It waits for you

01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:46.040
Alright, that was song number three in tonight's cage match. Monolithic with House of Joy. Let's go around and see if that was House of Joy or House of Pain to people.

01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:48.040
Dude, House of Pain was cool.

01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:50.040
Alright, let's see. Starting off with Jamie.

01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:55.040
That guy, okay, I'm sorry, if you're going to be a professional, learn how to hold a fucking key.

01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:56.040
Wow.

01:25:56.040 --> 01:25:57.040
I know!

01:25:57.040 --> 01:25:58.040
Politary.

01:25:58.040 --> 01:26:02.040
He falls, the sky falls in the same category as Politary.

01:26:02.040 --> 01:26:04.040
Cannot hold a key.

01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:12.040
The music was good, but the guy's voice sucked ass, so I'll split the difference and give it a 6.

01:26:34.040 --> 01:26:43.040
The voice doesn't really bother me. I think it's cool. And I like the music a lot. Let's give it a 9 from me. Angel.

01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:49.040
I like his stuff a lot. I have 9.

01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:54.040
And let's see what we thought. Arcadian 42.

01:26:54.040 --> 01:26:56.040
It was okay. I'll give it a 6.5.

01:26:56.040 --> 01:27:02.520
all right so remember it's not up to us it's up to you so let's review the songs

01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:07.680
you can vote for in tonight's cage match starting off with song number one last

01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:11.960
week's winner bitch by J punch

01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:30.360
Alright, and song number two in tonight's cage match was Ride Into Airborne Overclocked

01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:44.840
to mix and song number three in tonight's cage match was monolithic

01:27:44.840 --> 01:28:00.840
like House of Joy. Alright guys, you know the drill. Place vote now. Send a private

01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:08.040
message to Skye in the chat room with your vote. Joining us late during the cage match,

01:28:08.040 --> 01:28:13.600
He always likes to join us say hello to explicit real name Jonas

01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:16.120
How you doing?

01:28:16.120 --> 01:28:21.080
Doing fine. Just came back from the SVG l3 tournament. Well, not just now right and let's or did you just

01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:25.080
Save you just got back now. You were there a little late. You know, it ended yesterday, right?

01:28:25.080 --> 01:28:33.200
I think I competed it but into I gotta know none of us went I was really hoping to go but I got lazy and

01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:36.040
Because of my trip I got really badly burned out

01:28:36.040 --> 01:28:43.040
But at the same time, just keep in mind that the hype wasn't really worth all that hype.

01:28:43.040 --> 01:28:45.040
When you talk about the hype, what do you mean?

01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:52.040
You know how everybody says, oh it's SVGL, the biggest tournament in history. You got SVGL, I think.

01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:54.040
When was the first SVGL, do you remember?

01:28:54.040 --> 01:29:00.040
First SVGL was, I don't know, a long time ago.

01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:11.600
SVGL 2 was 2002 in April, I suppose. And SVGL is December 2004, the third installment.

01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:15.800
So it was the last in a long line of events then?

01:29:15.800 --> 01:29:22.280
Yeah, supposedly the biggest tournament ever. Depending on how people's opinions are.

01:29:22.280 --> 01:29:29.840
Well, I'll explain later. Do you have any questions?

01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:35.000
Not so far. I'm curious kind of what happened. How did the day go?

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:43.200
Well, it was a very, very long day. The PA really started at 11.45 for the qualifiers.

01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:51.560
I think the PA ended at 6 o'clock itself. It took that long because there was some controversy

01:29:51.560 --> 01:29:54.320
with the pads, some people were complaining. Okay, what is this controversy, because I've

01:29:54.320 --> 01:30:00.480
heard about it over on DDRFreak, on the forums. They said, because they switched, I think

01:30:00.480 --> 01:30:06.400
they switched the pads from fourth plus, or in the groove, whatever they switched the

01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:11.240
cabinet to, for the extreme. And they said that one player's side is not working, or

01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:15.720
I'm not really sure what's going on there. Someone said that this guy was a sore loser,

01:30:15.720 --> 01:30:20.840
or the pads were really not working, depending on what you guys' opinions, or different play

01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:27.120
playstyles. I can't really opinionize on that, but it delayed a shitload of time unnecessarily.

01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:31.320
Unfortunately, I've noticed this is kind of a trend in a lot of tournaments lately where

01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:35.280
somebody's complaining about the pad and then they have to do these extensive tests on it

01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:39.840
to see if they're working or not. My advice to future people who are going to be throwing

01:30:39.840 --> 01:30:45.160
tournaments, they have some kind of conflict resolution thing in the tournament rules that

01:30:45.160 --> 01:30:50.840
that says, if there is a question, this is the procedure, and that, whatever the outcome

01:30:50.840 --> 01:30:53.240
of that procedure is, end of story, no arguing, basically.

01:30:53.240 --> 01:30:58.600
I know, I've really learned a lot with the SDGL3 term in organizing, even though many

01:30:58.600 --> 01:31:03.840
have actually said that it was very badly organized, regardless if it's true or not,

01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:09.080
I would say it's badly organized because the time restraints, I think 2DX took way too

01:31:09.080 --> 01:31:13.360
long, even if there were just like five people who competed for 2DX.

01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:18.760
only five people? Yeah, 2DX Red, I'm assuming five or eight, but it took way too long for

01:31:18.760 --> 01:31:25.200
its own type. Usually that's too fast for eight people. But if it was like 32, it would

01:31:25.200 --> 01:31:31.720
take long, obviously. But yeah, around that much competed. It wasn't that many people.

01:31:31.720 --> 01:31:37.440
And Freestyle started hella late, but not to mention the lack of room for people to

01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:42.640
actually compete on. It was too crowded inside, people had to sit down for the camera, it

01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:46.160
It was all stuffed near the machines that have a lot of sound.

01:31:46.160 --> 01:31:48.640
Spigal is a very interesting place to have a tournament.

01:31:48.640 --> 01:31:49.840
They have a machine inside?

01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:50.840
Yeah.

01:31:50.840 --> 01:31:52.760
How in the hell were you able to see anything?

01:31:52.760 --> 01:31:55.600
Well, like I said, it was really worth the hype.

01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:56.600
I see.

01:31:56.600 --> 01:31:59.880
Because the management itself is also involved.

01:31:59.880 --> 01:32:07.680
They refuse to do certain things and certain expectations to us competitors.

01:32:07.680 --> 01:32:12.820
One is, yeah, of course, not everybody is satisfied, at least come to a point where

01:32:12.820 --> 01:32:16.120
everybody agrees in a way.

01:32:16.120 --> 01:32:21.440
I know Team Seattle was there, SoCal was there, some of the Sacramento people were there,

01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:22.440
like Toady.

01:32:22.440 --> 01:32:25.320
Yeah, I was kind of hoping he'd come tonight because no one talked to him about it because

01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:27.280
he competed, but...

01:32:27.280 --> 01:32:31.560
Yeah, and I competed, ugh.

01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:32.560
But in the world...

01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:33.560
Well, what was that ugh for?

01:32:33.560 --> 01:32:36.400
Because the rules kind of got altered in a way, I wasn't really sure if that was the

01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:41.760
rules because there was a qualifier list in SVGL3. I'm assuming... many people have

01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:47.560
thought it was going to be practicing one of the following songs, like Highs Off You,

01:32:47.560 --> 01:32:53.560
Superstar, etc, etc, etc. But I chose one of the... all of the things called ExtraTuned.

01:32:53.560 --> 01:32:57.720
Some people may have fucked up on it. Well, I fucked up on it for some reason. It's not

01:32:57.720 --> 01:33:01.640
all my grace in the beginning. And some people were okay down with it, but some people were

01:33:01.640 --> 01:33:06.580
not really happy with the rules there. But then again, it's a competition. Don't want

01:33:06.580 --> 01:33:12.100
to start drama. Do the drama during the forums, but not during the tournaments. That's where

01:33:12.100 --> 01:33:17.460
the forums come in the after to see what they can do better. Even though 50% of the control

01:33:17.460 --> 01:33:23.980
is basically on SVGL's part. So how did Freestyle go? I heard Freestyle was really good. That

01:33:23.980 --> 01:33:28.020
there were a lot of really high level people. Well, I can't really opinionize that. There

01:33:28.020 --> 01:33:31.820
There were some ups and downs with freestyle.

01:33:31.820 --> 01:33:35.900
The ups was, it was a good competition, great competition, great competitors competed.

01:33:35.900 --> 01:33:45.100
Like Tequila from Omaha came all the way from there to the Bay just to compete, turned out

01:33:45.100 --> 01:33:46.100
very good.

01:33:46.100 --> 01:33:53.440
Some of the performances showed a lot of hard work in a way, especially with finals.

01:33:53.440 --> 01:33:58.880
Why the hell are you going to place a fucking tournament right after college finals?

01:33:58.880 --> 01:34:03.680
Well, because they don't want to do it on Christmas.

01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:07.440
You could find a problem with almost any week that you could possibly pick, I think.

01:34:07.440 --> 01:34:12.440
Well, because I thought SVGL was supposed to be held during the summer, which was a

01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:17.560
predicted thing, but Christmas, right before Christmas, it's finals, people are stressing

01:34:17.560 --> 01:34:19.440
out over freestyle section.

01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:25.520
can't do a routine because the freestyle in my opinion was too limited for that whole

01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:29.120
day because right after finals you have to work on a routine.

01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:34.200
It's a big pain in the ass, especially when I had finals.

01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:40.640
Some people had finals like two of them on Friday and had to work immediate without sleep

01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:43.200
just to make sure it looks good.

01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:47.920
But the biggest problem with the environment of the freestyle is that they didn't put outside,

01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:53.640
you have a lot of air conditioning. Of course, the place itself wasn't even air conditioned.

01:34:53.640 --> 01:34:58.400
The second of all, very limited space. You've got people crowding all over the pad. Some

01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:02.960
people wanted to do a lot of movement outside the pad, but they're limited because they've

01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:09.280
got people around blocking their... Even my routine got fucked over.

01:35:09.280 --> 01:35:13.840
How so? Because it required at least three to five

01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:18.120
feet of open space on my right side when I was competing.

01:35:18.120 --> 01:35:26.480
Now, was it supposedly going to happen that there was going to be the machine outside?

01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:27.480
Was that ever said?

01:35:27.480 --> 01:35:28.480
That was a possibility.

01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:29.480
Although in the winter...

01:35:29.480 --> 01:35:30.480
Well, SPGL2 had it.

01:35:30.480 --> 01:35:33.560
Yeah, but I can see where in the winter there might be rain concerns too.

01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:36.280
I mean, because then imagine if it had rained and they tried to put the machine outside,

01:35:36.280 --> 01:35:37.840
it would have been even more cramped.

01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:38.840
So...

01:35:38.840 --> 01:35:44.840
No, I mean the weather itself was not to a point where it was about to rain.

01:35:44.840 --> 01:35:47.880
Besides the way I checked the weather in SVGL beforehand so I didn't know what the hell

01:35:47.880 --> 01:35:48.880
was going on.

01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:49.880
Right.

01:35:49.880 --> 01:35:53.440
Even though, of course the weather is not really 100% accurate.

01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:59.720
But at the same time, but here's another problem with the situation with the freestyle conditions.

01:35:59.720 --> 01:36:03.680
You got extreme near the fourth plus machine.

01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:07.200
So you're either going to probably be hearing extreme songs and fourth plus at the same

01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:10.600
time conflicting with your concentration on the routine.

01:36:10.600 --> 01:36:13.120
So you might be hearing like, oooh, later to max and...

01:36:13.120 --> 01:36:14.960
They didn't turn one off or anything?

01:36:14.960 --> 01:36:22.120
No, for some reason the Xtreme was a little louder than friggin' 4th Plus.

01:36:22.120 --> 01:36:24.380
And we got the 2DX written almost nearby too.

01:36:24.380 --> 01:36:26.240
Was In the Groove involved too, or did they...

01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:30.040
No, no, the In the Groove machine got switched with 4th Plus.

01:36:30.040 --> 01:36:31.040
Gotcha.

01:36:31.040 --> 01:36:32.040
Okay, gotcha.

01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:33.040
So you got...

01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:39.040
Regardless, I still have not played In The Groove, so I can't really opinionize with these steps on In The Groove.

01:36:39.040 --> 01:36:44.040
That would have been interesting though, if that was up and running or whatever.

01:36:44.040 --> 01:36:47.040
I kind of scolded on that one.

01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:48.040
Wait, what?

01:36:48.040 --> 01:36:55.040
Like, DCB doesn't really like In The Groove. Not many people like In The Groove because they have complaints with freestyle steps.

01:36:55.040 --> 01:36:56.040
Well, yeah.

01:36:56.040 --> 01:37:00.040
But that's controversial. I can't really say anything because I've never tested the thing.

01:37:00.040 --> 01:37:00.540
Right.

01:37:00.540 --> 01:37:02.040
And of course, everything is a matter of opinion.

01:37:02.040 --> 01:37:07.400
I'm kind of surprised nobody took that opportunity, though, to do something with In The Groove.

01:37:07.400 --> 01:37:11.040
Kind of, I don't know, like having to go to the west coast.

01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:12.040
I mean, they only have two cabinets.

01:37:12.040 --> 01:37:18.560
They only have two cabinets, and of course, like, you got SVGL, CVGL, RV, not RVGL, well,

01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:22.840
sort of the way RVGL, MGL, they're all part of, they're all golfers, so they have to share

01:37:22.840 --> 01:37:24.720
machines with each other in a way.

01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:25.720
Right.

01:37:25.720 --> 01:37:31.240
Especially in the barrier, which is very, of course, you know, like, MGL gave, got the

01:37:31.240 --> 01:37:37.320
pump it up a seat from SVGL, and probably in the groove from SVGL, I'm not really sure

01:37:37.320 --> 01:37:43.320
if that's true or not, or if both places have this in the groove.

01:37:43.320 --> 01:37:44.320
Interesting.

01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:50.040
Yeah, let's see, 2DX, oh, did you want to hear about the results?

01:37:50.040 --> 01:37:52.240
Yeah, what happened with the 2DX turning?

01:37:52.240 --> 01:37:57.680
Well, I really didn't really see what's with 2DX, but I've heard that a lot of people complaining

01:37:57.680 --> 01:38:04.680
about the, how 2DX Red was off sync as shit. Yes, it's like, think of it as night style.

01:38:05.640 --> 01:38:06.680
I'm not sure if it's the...

01:38:06.680 --> 01:38:10.680
Not the fucking game is, they gotta get used to it.

01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:17.360
No, I'm not sure if it's the hardware, I'm not sure, cause some people were complaining

01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:23.520
with that. I really couldn't complain, either I had the worst accuracy or on 2DX that I

01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:28.360
myself and I got a good attack the whole song and this is on a red was it on a

01:38:28.360 --> 01:38:37.040
red red oh wow yes the new red deliver style whoo wow drool get a boner but I'm

01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:40.480
not sure if it's really but since RV jails getting one I'm not sure that's

01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:44.280
gonna be if it's the hardware problem that people are saying was a software

01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:49.920
problems itself hmm but hell only time will tell what the what's the truth

01:38:49.920 --> 01:38:50.920
If it's off.

01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:51.920
We'll see.

01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:52.920
Alright.

01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:56.440
Is there any questions with the SBGL tournament?

01:38:56.440 --> 01:38:57.440
I don't know.

01:38:57.440 --> 01:38:59.360
Nothing I haven't gotten on there and read myself.

01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:02.560
I just kind of feel bad that I wasn't really able to go to the tournament because I really

01:39:02.560 --> 01:39:05.400
wanted to go but then at the same time it sounded like it was really crowded as hell

01:39:05.400 --> 01:39:08.520
and not a lot of standing room and if I wasn't entering maybe...

01:39:08.520 --> 01:39:13.280
Well, Bill B. Sy, there was some drama involved as well so you don't want to leave.

01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:14.280
What's the drama?

01:39:14.280 --> 01:39:16.080
Ooh, tell us about drama.

01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:17.480
I'll get to the FUs on that one.

01:39:17.480 --> 01:39:18.480
No, no, no.

01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:19.480
I want to know now.

01:39:19.480 --> 01:39:23.640
some people will like it you take up too much time during the FUs anyway let's

01:39:23.640 --> 01:39:27.120
get himself okay let's get out some of it now all right here's like some drama

01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:32.960
with some people like getting pissed up with JSB's behavior which is nothing new

01:39:32.960 --> 01:39:40.840
oh yeah JSB throwing a football on DDR bots head oh well how old is DDR bot

01:39:40.840 --> 01:39:46.120
like 11 years old okay I'll pick it up a little so so basically he's resorting to

01:39:46.120 --> 01:39:49.560
to an 11-year-old's immaturity to pick on the 11-year-old. Just curious, all right?

01:39:49.560 --> 01:39:53.560
Yes, well, yeah, you got that. Okay, okay. Birds of a feather.

01:39:53.560 --> 01:39:58.080
Well, of course you got the complaints of the pads, whether or not it's SVGL sport,

01:39:58.080 --> 01:40:02.560
or if it's the people being sort of loser. Who started it?

01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:04.520
I can't get involved. All right, all right.

01:40:04.520 --> 01:40:07.680
There's some people drooling over DDR players' girlfriends.

01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:11.880
I have to ask, I have to ask the hard-hitting questions of this program, all right? I want

01:40:11.880 --> 01:40:17.240
know who started the shit who cast the first stone who's the drama starter who

01:40:17.240 --> 01:40:22.040
is their fire flanning the flames I can't really I don't really know exactly

01:40:22.040 --> 01:40:29.360
it has something to do with so Cal and team Seattle which is a long going back

01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:34.320
and forth that's happened for a long long time so that's again not a surprise

01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:39.280
all right I'm not sure what happened but they said it was JSB versus some girl in

01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:46.280
Team Seattle. JSB won that one, but for some reason he dropped out of the race. For either

01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:52.480
attraction, or sexually attractive reasons, or...

01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:58.200
Was it Tanya? The girl that's always on, because I know she was going, the girl that's... Get

01:40:58.200 --> 01:40:59.680
up, move girl!

01:40:59.680 --> 01:41:01.040
I'm not really sure.

01:41:01.040 --> 01:41:04.680
If I remember correctly reading this, because I read this briefly, I think. It was the chick

01:41:04.680 --> 01:41:07.760
that was the one that was on MTV promoting DDR.

01:41:07.760 --> 01:41:10.260
I didn't know there was anyone on MTV promoting DDR1.

01:41:10.260 --> 01:41:11.760
What the hell? I don't even know about this.

01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:17.760
Yes, actually, Tanya was on the, um, what is it, the 20 games of the year thing or something?

01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:18.760
They did shot stuff.

01:41:18.760 --> 01:41:19.760
Oh yeah, I've heard about that.

01:41:19.760 --> 01:41:21.760
They shot stuff around Seattle. Yeah, okay, so.

01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:22.760
I heard about that.

01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:23.760
Alright, so.

01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:29.760
Oh yeah, for the winners of PA, one of the first places, of course, Team Seattle.

01:41:29.760 --> 01:41:35.260
Second was Fidox, who actually came to the FU tournament and the August.

01:41:35.260 --> 01:41:36.260
Okay, good deal.

01:41:36.260 --> 01:41:37.260
So that was very good.

01:41:37.260 --> 01:41:38.380
uh...

01:41:38.380 --> 01:41:41.140
third-place i don't remember third-place but uh...

01:41:41.140 --> 01:41:45.180
i've got to die back to drama was there any good freestyle drama

01:41:45.180 --> 01:41:46.260
uh...

01:41:46.260 --> 01:41:49.540
well the limited rooms but of course i've told you about the freestyle drama

01:41:49.540 --> 01:41:51.880
but the limited amount of room space

01:41:51.880 --> 01:41:52.740
people get it

01:41:52.740 --> 01:41:54.380
i have to know i have to know

01:41:54.380 --> 01:41:57.140
did anybody get served

01:41:57.140 --> 01:41:58.260
and what way

01:41:58.260 --> 01:41:59.500
he did

01:41:59.500 --> 01:42:03.580
today they do their routine ago you got to do it

01:42:03.580 --> 01:42:05.140
nobody got served

01:42:05.140 --> 01:42:11.180
No, because people were just waiting for freestyle to start. It took too long for everybody else

01:42:11.180 --> 01:42:15.700
to fucking get freestyle prepared. I think it started at 8.30. That was too late. Everybody's

01:42:15.700 --> 01:42:20.260
tired. Oh shit, I could have gone to Spigol if I knew it was going to go that way. But

01:42:20.260 --> 01:42:26.020
at the same time though, I mean, the condition, it was just too hot inside and limited space.

01:42:26.020 --> 01:42:31.340
You can't really do anything. It's like pointing your fingers upwards, just not moving your

01:42:31.340 --> 01:42:34.340
your whole body and using the whole, taking advantage of the whole freestyle.

01:42:34.340 --> 01:42:37.340
Okay, were there any fistfights? No, there were no.

01:42:37.340 --> 01:42:38.340
Stouting matches? Huh?

01:42:38.340 --> 01:42:43.340
Knives drawn? No, no, no. But I heard, yeah, oh yeah.

01:42:43.340 --> 01:42:48.340
Okay, I was just reading the forums, some people saying, damn Fab Five, it does have,

01:42:48.340 --> 01:42:52.340
they have something to do with throwing a football at an 11 year old's head.

01:42:52.340 --> 01:43:00.340
Wait, Fab Five, you mean like Carson and Tom and Gan and all them were there?

01:43:00.340 --> 01:43:05.340
Everybody in the circle is there, but I'm not sure what the hell is going on with this drama and shit.

01:43:05.340 --> 01:43:08.340
But you know, this drama exists, and...

01:43:08.340 --> 01:43:14.340
And people are serving other people, and it's just, you know, servolution.

01:43:14.340 --> 01:43:20.340
Then you got boyfriend-girlfriend conflicts with other men, or other women, whatever the hell you say it.

01:43:20.340 --> 01:43:25.340
Well, this should be interesting, because one of the, I think one of the NorCal people

01:43:25.340 --> 01:43:27.340
was saying, why is this?

01:43:27.340 --> 01:43:30.340
Uh-uh, uh-uh, okay, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh,

01:43:30.340 --> 01:43:33.340
he is not sleeping with my boyfriend, okay?

01:43:33.340 --> 01:43:35.340
Okay, now, uh-uh, it's not gonna happen.

01:43:35.340 --> 01:43:38.340
Okay, I'm gonna serve you right now, okay?

01:43:38.340 --> 01:43:39.340
Well, here's the thing, this is...

01:43:39.340 --> 01:43:40.340
How was that?

01:43:40.340 --> 01:43:41.340
I don't know.

01:43:41.340 --> 01:43:42.340
Well, what's funny is that...

01:43:42.340 --> 01:43:44.340
That was my, like, Texas-slash-ghetto.

01:43:44.340 --> 01:43:46.340
It was my Texas ghetto.

01:43:46.340 --> 01:43:47.340
This is what a...

01:43:47.340 --> 01:43:48.340
I don't understand this drama.

01:43:48.340 --> 01:43:50.340
This is one of the funniest quotes I've ever...

01:43:50.340 --> 01:43:52.340
One of the funniest questions that has been asked to me.

yes i have actually talked to a gay person in a minute

01:44:37.620 --> 01:44:39.440
he's like you rob

01:44:39.440 --> 01:44:40.500

01:44:43.380 --> 01:44:45.020
well i would be

01:44:45.020 --> 01:44:47.860
like you rob a gay

01:44:47.860 --> 01:44:49.260
I'm not gay, I just...

01:44:49.260 --> 01:44:51.260
Whoa, whoa, whoa! How about you?

01:44:51.260 --> 01:44:52.960
You just pull in on the radio.

01:44:52.960 --> 01:44:55.460
Yeah, this is just my radio personality, okay?

01:44:55.460 --> 01:44:58.160
Yeah, pussy! I'm all about the pussy, man.

01:44:58.160 --> 01:45:00.260
Tits, yeah, that's what I want right now.

01:45:00.260 --> 01:45:02.460
A big, big...

01:45:02.460 --> 01:45:03.860
I can't do it.

01:45:03.860 --> 01:45:05.460
I'm...

01:45:05.460 --> 01:45:08.660
I'm better than Judy Garland. I can't hold it anymore.

01:45:08.660 --> 01:45:11.560
Well, perhaps you and that gay guy would have a good match.

01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:15.860
And if he plays DDR, he's probably under 18, so not a good idea.

01:45:15.860 --> 01:45:20.020
uh... he's over eighty by much of the place bdr anything like that

01:45:20.020 --> 01:45:25.380
an actual living breathing a person

01:45:25.380 --> 01:45:28.320
well therefore because i'm gay in this other person's gay

01:45:28.320 --> 01:45:31.500
we have to have sex on the top

01:45:31.500 --> 01:45:33.400
did they capture him in net

01:45:33.400 --> 01:45:34.780
you know because

01:45:34.780 --> 01:45:38.140
because if one of the cases right around there you know

01:45:38.140 --> 01:45:39.680
you know what that's the spring

01:45:39.680 --> 01:45:41.140
waited right well he

01:45:41.140 --> 01:45:45.060
it does that they have to think that he was gay

01:45:45.060 --> 01:45:57.580
as he's like bent over some dude. Yeah, I'm gay. Oh man, sorry. Not sorry. Well, I'm glad

01:45:57.580 --> 01:46:07.820
you could finally meet a gay person. Alright, thank you. Alright, moving on. Let's go talk

01:46:07.820 --> 01:46:13.700
about, because the chat room is getting restless, they're going. How long have they been having

01:46:13.700 --> 01:46:18.380
this conversation no Loki I want to go to break oh yeah where's SVGL is near

01:46:18.380 --> 01:46:24.820
MGL problem solved SVGL is in the Bay Area it's in southern Bay Area kind of

01:46:24.820 --> 01:46:29.620
actually it's a 20-minute drive or near MGL it's like if you know where MGL is

01:46:29.620 --> 01:46:32.940
it's basically and if you don't know where it is it's near San Jose California

01:46:32.940 --> 01:46:37.100
basically it's a simple the easy because remember we're an international program

01:46:37.100 --> 01:46:41.860
drive eight three simple steps to drive the Milpitas go to i-80 then go to

01:46:41.860 --> 01:46:49.140
680 then exit where you still see it you'll see that's SVG I'm talking about

01:46:49.140 --> 01:46:55.820
MGL SV just takes a little longer to get to though and there's gay people there

01:46:55.820 --> 01:47:02.420
yes just start you know what just get in your car and start driving towards the

01:47:02.420 --> 01:47:06.420
Madonna music and you'll end up in spiggle soon enough you'll see the giant

01:47:06.420 --> 01:47:16.180
in the air. You know they're all tagged. And they've got, like, you know, those tags, like,

You know what you want to do, don't look back at me

01:52:21.400 --> 01:52:24.400
Sure I will see you through

01:52:24.400 --> 01:52:29.400
No time for sleepin' when I can't get through

01:52:29.400 --> 01:52:34.400
So understand, oh, oh, oh

You need to get your faith, keep all the faith

01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:42.400
I don't think I lost it in a while

01:52:42.400 --> 01:52:45.400
You can't halfway lose it just you

01:52:45.400 --> 01:52:52.400
There's such a thing that you really don't have to try

01:52:52.400 --> 01:53:00.400
You're due to hold all that you wish for if you had

01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:06.400
You're flying emo, have fun while you can and even

01:53:36.400 --> 01:53:53.440
Hi, this is Mel B of RTF, and for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join

01:53:53.440 --> 01:53:55.120
us on all the fun together.

01:53:55.120 --> 01:53:59.080
But hey, if you're a broke-ass like I am, why don't you come to the one place that costs

01:53:59.080 --> 01:54:02.560
absolutely nothing to go to, and still the fun is just as great.

01:54:02.560 --> 01:54:05.080
It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.

01:54:05.080 --> 01:54:12.080
Take it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.

01:54:35.080 --> 01:54:40.240
tonight with us going on what yeah now I want to talk to you because I noticed

01:54:40.240 --> 01:54:43.120
that you were doing something else so of course I want to distract you from that

01:54:43.120 --> 01:54:47.040
other thing you were doing if you want to join our chat room www.orangelawnsradio.com

01:54:47.040 --> 01:54:50.720

01:54:50.720 --> 01:54:56.600
there in our chat room again we also have many programming that goes on

01:54:56.600 --> 01:55:00.440
during the week Monday nights diversion the orange launch radio remix show

01:55:00.440 --> 01:55:06.240

outside the box with me, Rice Princess and Lanky Style, and Friday night over on DDR

01:55:19.040 --> 01:55:24.160
Freak Radio, relive the magic of Orange Talent Radio Sunday nights as DDR Freak Radio rebroadcasts

01:55:24.160 --> 01:55:30.560
our Sunday night program at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time. Loki, what's up?

01:55:30.560 --> 01:55:40.840
Well, sim stuff. Basically, DDR maniacs has been down for a while now, so no new theme

01:55:40.840 --> 01:55:50.240
stuff. Shhh, Loki. Anyways, there was a couple of turnouts going on that I don't care about,

01:55:50.240 --> 01:55:55.920
Anyways, um, the first one that should be mentioned, well, I guess that'll be the first one.

01:55:55.920 --> 01:56:06.920
Tourney Mix 5+, which is called the Re-Tourney Mix, which, I didn't really read the rules, but it sounds like it's just taking old songs from the Tourney Mix 1 through 5 and redoing them. Big deal.

01:56:06.920 --> 01:56:09.240
Okay, so that's going on right now, you can find all the information you want in front-

01:56:09.240 --> 01:56:11.240
Okay, okay, I have a comment.

01:56:11.240 --> 01:56:18.240
Okay, so it's basically like the flashback episode of your favorite sitcom. It's the same old shit, with a different laugh track.

01:56:18.240 --> 01:56:28.280
Yeah, so there's that. Then there's DDR OSC 3 Plus, the original set file contest. This

01:56:28.280 --> 01:56:34.280
is remixed, basically. The rules for this is it has to be a song, a remix of a song

01:56:34.280 --> 01:56:41.160
that's been used in DDR Attorney Mix, a remix of a song that's been used in OSC, or an Overclocked

01:56:41.160 --> 01:56:46.400
remix that hasn't been used in either one, or an original remix of a song that's in a

01:56:46.400 --> 01:56:52.200
non-music game, you know, base game. So, no DDR remixes, but, you know, remixes of other

01:56:52.200 --> 01:56:57.640
crap is okay. And the due date for this is the 28th. All your information can be found

01:56:57.640 --> 01:57:02.480
on the MyStyle. There's links to the OSC homepage and all that wonderful crap. And,

01:57:02.480 --> 01:57:07.240
um, other than that, still stuff's being worked on for the, you know, the Symphile releases.

01:57:07.240 --> 01:57:11.480
Now, one of the things I thought was funny that I'd like to mention was we've had our

01:57:11.480 --> 01:57:20.780
very first, very first, um, record label coming after a DDR site for music being up on there.

01:57:20.780 --> 01:57:25.920
And it's the funniest record label, you'd never expect it to be on there. It was the

01:57:25.920 --> 01:57:37.660
music from Circus de Soleil. Is that? Cirque de Soleil. Oh, my mistake. Anyways, um, they,

01:57:37.660 --> 01:57:41.220
uh... actually came after my cell for having to get some of the music on their

01:57:41.220 --> 01:57:41.920
site

01:57:41.920 --> 01:57:45.240
which should be surprising because any of their music actually being out there

01:57:45.240 --> 01:57:46.220
on the internet

01:57:46.220 --> 01:57:49.480
why the fuck anyone want to listen to it let them make a remix

01:57:49.480 --> 01:57:53.280
or a uh... not remix a simp file for that i don't know

01:57:53.280 --> 01:57:58.020
what i want to know is how the fuck did someone find that

01:57:58.020 --> 01:57:58.580
anyways

01:57:58.580 --> 01:58:01.480
so they got the seasoned assist for that

01:58:01.480 --> 01:58:04.300
uh... thing but everything else is going as planned but i just thought that was

01:58:04.300 --> 01:58:11.980
funny that that would be on there um other than that really nothing else going on so just those

01:58:11.980 --> 01:58:19.340
two little tournaments there that are really don't have that much notice for and um well whatever

01:58:20.860 --> 01:58:26.620
uh a comment in our chat room i'd like some discussion on tournaments is shit discuss

01:58:28.540 --> 01:58:33.580
i just really don't care anymore you know everybody's like i don't even remember

01:58:33.580 --> 01:58:40.580
I don't look at those as a good indicator. There really aren't that many quality sim files out there anymore.

01:58:40.580 --> 01:58:46.580
Here's the problem. The pool is way too diluted, as you just said. I didn't follow any of that shit you just said, basically.

01:58:46.580 --> 01:58:50.580
All I heard was blah, blah, blah, another contest on blah, blah, blah, another site. With blah, blah, blah.

01:58:50.580 --> 01:58:54.580
And what the fuck? It's a contest based off of other contests? That's kind of weird to me, sorry.

01:58:54.580 --> 01:59:01.580
But, so basically you've got what? You've got tournaments, and then you have the EI tournament, and then you have this, and then that.

01:59:01.580 --> 01:59:05.340
everybody's got a freaking tournament going on right now it's just like how

01:59:05.340 --> 01:59:09.620
like two years ago when extreme was kind of new every other week there was a DDR

01:59:09.620 --> 01:59:13.180
tournament somewhere like I remember in NorCal every week for a couple months

01:59:13.180 --> 01:59:16.420
there was a tournament somewhere and it was just like people did not have the

01:59:16.420 --> 01:59:21.340
time to come up with freestyle routines they didn't care anymore so I see the

01:59:21.340 --> 01:59:24.540
same thing happening here here's my problem okay and this is the biggest

01:59:24.540 --> 01:59:29.040
problem that I have with everything once food mix came out that set the new

01:59:29.040 --> 01:59:35.040
I'm sorry. It's just nothing has come close. Nothing will come close until Food Mix releases something else.

01:59:35.040 --> 01:59:36.040
Oh yeah, Food Mix.

01:59:36.040 --> 01:59:44.040
And that's it. So, you know what? I'm sorry, but there's no, no Simphile creator out there that can even match that, or even come close to matching that.

01:59:44.040 --> 01:59:52.040
Even without the yippie hippie background movies. If you were to take the background movies out, would you still feel the same?

01:59:52.040 --> 01:59:56.600
the same. Because I think background movies is a little much to ask some Joe Shmo in their

01:59:56.600 --> 02:00:00.800
basement to create. How the hell the food mix guys did it? Hey, you know what? I don't

02:00:00.800 --> 02:00:03.440
know. They just had way too much free time. But come on.

02:00:03.440 --> 02:00:06.400
You're very talented though. I mean, that's what it really was.

02:00:06.400 --> 02:00:10.320
Don't get me wrong. And I, the songs are great and the steps are great. I'm not arguing that.

02:00:10.320 --> 02:00:11.320
Well, that's a pretty good question.

02:00:11.320 --> 02:00:16.080
I'm just saying, they've got a really, they've got it all. So, even if you were to remove

02:00:16.080 --> 02:00:18.160
the videos, would you still say that?

02:00:18.160 --> 02:00:19.160
Yeah.

02:00:19.160 --> 02:00:24.160
So, the artwork in the background is still phenomenal, and they created their own songs that didn't sound like shit.

02:00:24.160 --> 02:00:30.160
That was also really good. And the interface, the whole theme was awesome. Just everything about that was awesome.

02:00:30.160 --> 02:00:33.160
Now, as I see in the chat room, you know, how about the judging?

02:00:33.160 --> 02:00:39.160
Well, I've been saying it since, what, Turnimix 2-3-1, I don't know, it doesn't matter.

02:00:39.160 --> 02:00:46.160
I've been saying they cannot have these sim files labeled by who made them, because you'll never get fair judging for it.

02:00:46.160 --> 02:00:48.920
What do they do every time they fucking label who they're from?

02:00:48.920 --> 02:00:51.920
Then they're not voting on Simphile, they're voting for who their favorite person is.

02:00:51.920 --> 02:00:58.280
And everybody goes straight to download D.M. Ashura's file, and they go straight to download

02:00:58.280 --> 02:00:59.280
Moogle Hunter's file.

02:00:59.280 --> 02:01:02.200
And don't get me wrong, I love Moogle Hunter, he's a local guy, I love him.

02:01:02.200 --> 02:01:03.200
And what else?

02:01:03.200 --> 02:01:08.280
They go straight to download Bahmani Ruler, Jesus Christ, and they go straight to download

02:01:08.280 --> 02:01:11.560
whatever, the big people in the Sim scenes.

02:01:11.560 --> 02:01:12.560
And they win!

02:01:12.560 --> 02:01:17.560
Actually, you can't say that about Boogle Hunter from X4, because he got screwed over and, you know...

02:01:17.560 --> 02:01:22.560
Well, you actually can't say that because they started doing the pack thing, which is just a more wasted bandwidth on the internet.

02:01:22.560 --> 02:01:31.560
It doesn't matter anymore. No one seems to care. I mean, there are, I guess, people... I don't know. I just really... I don't know. It doesn't matter to me anymore.

02:01:31.560 --> 02:01:37.560
I used to go to those and go, oh, there's some good sim files there, but now it's just like, no, they're not. No, no, no.

02:01:37.560 --> 02:01:38.560
No, I'm sorry.

02:01:38.560 --> 02:01:46.560
It gets gone to shit, basically. People will just not care, and they just go, let's download a song, and let's get a high score of it.

02:01:46.560 --> 02:01:56.560
Okay, I download personally, I go on, you know, by myself almost daily, and I look on there in their sim files, you know, selection area, and I look and see what remixes are on there.

02:01:56.560 --> 02:02:00.560
And I listen to every single Max remix on there, every single one that's been made.

02:02:00.560 --> 02:02:01.560
Yeah!

02:02:01.560 --> 02:02:06.560
Okay, I know that's wrong, but I do it, you know, because you know what, there are every-

02:02:06.560 --> 02:02:18.560
Next person to take a Max song and mix it with a Pops A or Pops B song like Max, I don't know, Max, Mr. Wonderful or whatever?

02:02:18.560 --> 02:02:24.560
I hope you get laughed off the internet, seriously. Mr. Maxifull or whatever, I hope you get laughed off the internet.

02:02:24.560 --> 02:02:29.560
Well, someone did make- I think someone did do It's Renny Max, I'm not really sure that's true.

02:02:29.560 --> 02:02:31.560
Kill me!

02:02:59.560 --> 02:03:04.560
Actually, I wouldn't say but constructive comments because, you know, people post things,

02:03:04.560 --> 02:03:07.560
Ooh, you stole this! You stole that!

02:03:07.560 --> 02:03:11.560
Crap, and then it gets deleted afterwards by a mod.

02:03:11.560 --> 02:03:14.560
Anyways, whatever.

02:03:14.560 --> 02:03:18.560
So basically, yeah, there's just not a lot of good shit out there anymore.

02:03:18.560 --> 02:03:24.560
I'm sorry, food mix and diverse systems have basically cornered the market in sim files and remixes, so...

02:03:24.560 --> 02:03:26.560
Sorry.

02:03:26.560 --> 02:03:31.640
All right, and that's all that's going on in the sims team right now, it's just a variety

02:03:31.640 --> 02:03:32.640
of tournaments.

02:03:32.640 --> 02:03:33.640
You know what?

02:03:33.640 --> 02:03:34.640
Here's an idea.

02:03:34.640 --> 02:03:37.600
If you want to make your tournament stand out above all the other remix tournaments,

02:03:37.600 --> 02:03:40.000
how about throwing some decent prizes?

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.160
Get some entry fees and some real good prizes.

02:03:42.160 --> 02:03:46.340
Get some folks to donate some good stuff, because really, what's the best prize you've

02:03:46.340 --> 02:03:48.840
ever seen for one of these tournaments?

02:03:48.840 --> 02:03:49.840
Nothing.

02:03:49.840 --> 02:03:51.840
Just the prizes.

02:03:51.840 --> 02:03:52.840
Case in point.

02:03:52.840 --> 02:03:53.840
Thank you very much.

02:03:53.840 --> 02:03:57.760
a really really good freestyle routines when there's a thousand dollar pot on the line

02:03:57.760 --> 02:04:01.780
when you see the really shit for routines you know when it's going to be a pat on the

02:04:01.780 --> 02:04:09.000
back and a certificate you know good job you the winner you winner of tourney mint just

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:15.700
just one little quick note here i like to mention um goldwave is not a remixing program

02:04:15.700 --> 02:04:21.360
do not use it as a remixing program it is not meant for remixing it's meant for audio

02:04:21.360 --> 02:04:27.680
editing audio editing does not include remixing please do not use it to remix stuff speeding up a

02:04:27.680 --> 02:04:32.480
song or putting a filter over it does not constitute a remix please do not make it a remix please do

02:04:32.480 --> 02:04:38.160
not reverse a song call it a remix it's not a remix stop people please stop

02:04:41.680 --> 02:04:48.320
all right on that note i think we're gonna go to a break um let's see oh yes loki and chopping up

02:04:48.320 --> 02:04:55.560
a song very crudely and in, I might add, Gold Wave, is also not a remix.

02:04:55.560 --> 02:05:01.760
Okay, fair enough. I think what we're going to do is we're going to go to a break, and

02:05:01.760 --> 02:05:04.880
why don't we do, because we haven't played any of this in a while, why don't we do some

02:05:04.880 --> 02:05:07.200
music from Phoon Mix? Sound good?

02:05:07.200 --> 02:05:08.200
Yes.

02:05:08.200 --> 02:05:09.200
Sounds phony.

02:05:09.200 --> 02:05:13.000
Sounds Phoon-erific. Alright, we'll play some Phoon Mix music, and then we come back the

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:18.200
FUs of the week, because what a good way to follow up with some Phoon Mix music. Alright,

02:05:18.200 --> 02:05:23.760
we'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio. Enjoy.

02:05:48.200 --> 02:05:53.200
Feel the touch of my hand

02:06:10.200 --> 02:06:12.200
He's the brute of your head

02:06:12.200 --> 02:06:14.200
Hittin' time in battle at the end

02:06:14.200 --> 02:06:21.200
Hit the coast.

02:06:44.200 --> 02:06:51.200
Feel you.

02:12:14.200 --> 02:12:20.200
people to bust out a Sharpie pen, draw arrows on the tiles, and start stomping away.

02:12:20.200 --> 02:12:25.200
A friendly public service announcement from Orange Lounge Radio.

02:12:25.200 --> 02:12:30.200
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio. We're going to try to do a list list in a little

02:12:30.200 --> 02:12:35.200
while, and I think the topic tonight, so you guys can start thinking about it. Don't, well,

02:12:35.200 --> 02:12:41.200
should I hold off on it? Yeah. Alright, well hold off on it. Some of you guys that were

02:12:41.200 --> 02:12:44.640
chat earlier tonight they'll already know what the list list is all about for

02:12:44.640 --> 02:12:48.640
tonight so you know start thinking about that because I am going to do the one

02:12:48.640 --> 02:12:51.000
that you guys were talking about beforehand I said that would be a good

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:57.440
list list topic we'll do that but first we have to get ranty yes because it just

02:12:57.440 --> 02:13:00.440
would not be an episode of orange launch radio if we did not have a little bit

02:13:00.440 --> 02:13:06.000
when the hell is that noise you need to talk about what that's all about Loki

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
p0k3smot42o1 that's one gaussian meter

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:43.560
the TV on. Awesome. Yeah, it's a cancer meter. That's basically what it is. And it's also

02:13:43.560 --> 02:13:47.440
for ghost hunting. Yeah, I like how you just added that in here. Oh, and it's also for

02:13:47.440 --> 02:13:58.640
ghost hunting. Alright. Like the thing from Ghostbusters. The PKE meter. Shall we get

02:13:58.640 --> 02:14:02.900
to tonight's FUs of the Week? Sure. Alright, you guys can send in your FUs in the chat

02:14:02.900 --> 02:14:07.820
room right now, try to keep them brief please. However, why is it that we have to do the

02:14:07.820 --> 02:14:10.740
FUs every single week, Ms. Darkseidro?

02:14:10.740 --> 02:14:11.740
Buh-arg.

02:14:11.740 --> 02:14:32.740
My first FU goes to a people who decide to weave in and out of lanes in the fog.

02:14:32.740 --> 02:14:35.740
That's really stupid and that's how accidents happen.

02:14:35.740 --> 02:14:39.740
But then again, I suppose the Darwinism will soon work on that one.

02:14:39.740 --> 02:14:42.740
Another one goes to people who drive too slow in the fog,

02:14:42.740 --> 02:14:45.740
because then all the rest of us are backed up by the people who are speeding

02:14:45.740 --> 02:14:47.740
running into my ass.

02:14:47.740 --> 02:14:52.740
And of course, driving off without stopping or anything, so.

02:14:52.740 --> 02:14:57.740
A few goes to the top of my trunk inside,

02:14:57.740 --> 02:15:01.740
because I gouged out a big piece of my thumb just shy of the tendon.

02:15:01.740 --> 02:15:07.380
It bled, and bled, and bled, and I got one of those Band-Aids on it that's supposed

02:15:07.380 --> 02:15:13.780
to trap the fluids underneath so that you'll heal faster using your own antibodies, and

02:15:13.780 --> 02:15:15.540
it looked like a big purple bubble.

02:15:15.540 --> 02:15:18.340
It's really disgusting.

02:15:18.340 --> 02:15:26.420
And F you toward the financial situation to where I can't afford to get the special edition

02:15:26.420 --> 02:15:31.980
2DS tape style, but I have Parappa coming, so it's all good.

02:15:31.980 --> 02:15:38.220
And as you toured how expensive Dan's present was, since he doesn't listen to the show,

02:15:38.220 --> 02:15:44.460
I have no problem saying that I bought Dan the Ultimate Matrix box set, and it was 70

02:15:44.460 --> 02:15:45.460
bucks.

02:15:45.460 --> 02:15:49.300
Although, actually, I think that they marked it down by $10 a Target.

02:15:49.300 --> 02:15:51.420
I paid $59, so 10 different.

02:15:51.420 --> 02:15:54.260
No, $57, yeah, it was about that at Target.

02:15:54.260 --> 02:15:55.260
They lowered the price.

02:15:55.260 --> 02:15:59.820
But still, when I first looked at it and saw a $70 price tag, I was freaking out, but I

02:15:59.820 --> 02:16:04.700
bought it for him anyway.

02:16:04.700 --> 02:16:11.180
Another F.U. goes toward just the sick that I had for the past three days.

02:16:11.180 --> 02:16:16.380
It was the type of illness that just saps all of your energy, and I did nothing but

02:16:16.380 --> 02:16:21.900
eat lobster burritos and ice cream for three days, sat on the floor and played Fantasy

02:16:21.900 --> 02:16:28.900
kostjamrh The only thing I can remember is the stupid bitch that tried to pass me in the right lane today.

02:16:51.900 --> 02:17:18.900
kostjamrh And the slow driver has behind on the way to my dad's house today, because he's driving down a one lane road, fucking slow because there's a little fog in the distance, and he can only see 999 miles, and not the full 1000.

02:17:48.900 --> 02:17:58.900
p0k3smot42o I don't like potlucks

02:18:18.900 --> 02:18:23.900
p0k3smot42o i dont call you an addict

02:18:27.900 --> 02:18:32.900
p0k3smot42o i dont have much to complain about

02:18:38.900 --> 02:18:43.900
p0k3smot42o i dont have much to complain about

02:18:43.900 --> 02:18:51.240
for five years I'm not getting paid shit so that sucks and then I don't know I

02:18:51.240 --> 02:18:56.740
just hate Christmas fuck you to Christmas because you know I don't want

02:18:56.740 --> 02:19:01.200
to buy people gifts see you're a Grinch I buy people gifts all year round and I

02:19:01.200 --> 02:19:04.720
don't really get shit about the birthday of Jesus or whatever it is supposed to

02:19:04.720 --> 02:19:13.420
be for you know I'm sure immaculate conception okay that's what I got to say

02:19:13.420 --> 02:19:17.740
she Mary was a fucking whore okay she just does not want to admit it they're

02:19:17.740 --> 02:19:23.840
not putting it in the books okay but you know that she had a way she had a way

02:19:23.840 --> 02:19:30.160
around the Bethlehem there little slut anyway well now that we're all going to

02:19:30.160 --> 02:19:35.020
hell anything else you want to share yeah if I give a printer for the bean

02:19:35.020 --> 02:19:38.400
out of ink and I have to buy more ink because the fucking cartridges are like

02:19:38.400 --> 02:19:44.400
tiny. You print like one page and it's like, out of ink! You're out of ink! Ah, shit. I

02:19:44.400 --> 02:19:48.400
might as well buy a new printer, because it comes with new ink when you buy a new printer,

02:19:48.400 --> 02:19:54.400
and it's just about as expensive as replacing the ink, so, why not? There, I'm done.

02:20:00.400 --> 02:20:06.400
A nephew to the fog, because fog is scary, and I don't like driving in it, and I think people are always

02:20:06.400 --> 02:20:11.580
always going to run into me, and it's scary. An F.U. to the fact that the bar sucked last

02:20:11.580 --> 02:20:15.120
night, I did not have really a lot of fun. Well, you know, I had fun with the person

02:20:15.120 --> 02:20:20.920
that I went with, but I just wasn't feeling it. So, F.U. to bars in general. I think I'm

02:20:20.920 --> 02:20:28.200
going to stop going. Except for karaoke, because I love karaoke. And I don't really have a

02:20:28.200 --> 02:20:32.580
whole lot else. An F.U. to not really getting any sleep in the past few days, and the fact

02:20:32.580 --> 02:20:36.480
I'm not going to get any more in the next few because I've got a lot of stuff going

02:20:36.480 --> 02:20:45.480
on at work next week and I just want to cry. That's it for me. Let's go on to DDR Angel.

02:20:45.480 --> 02:20:52.480
Heh, as I try not to strangle Rob with the, uh, mic cord! Yay! Um...

02:20:52.480 --> 02:20:53.480
I actually have no idea.

02:20:53.480 --> 02:20:58.480
God, I don't even know. Well, yeah, just F you to circumstances, cause...

02:20:58.480 --> 02:21:03.480
Um, well, not for me personally, but for other people that I...

02:21:03.480 --> 02:21:04.480
You're a F you!

02:21:04.480 --> 02:21:11.480
Yeah, I know! But, uh, I don't like said person either, so never mind.

02:21:11.480 --> 02:21:23.480
And yeah, nothing else because it's Christmas week and I'm not as anxious as I was last week so, too bad.

02:21:25.480 --> 02:21:29.480
Alright, Arkadian42, what's on your mind?

02:21:31.480 --> 02:21:38.480
Uh, let's see, uh, fuck you to feeling kinda blah at the moment. I don't know, I just feel tired tonight.

02:21:38.480 --> 02:21:39.480
You're getting it.

02:21:39.480 --> 02:21:40.480
Am I getting it?

02:21:40.480 --> 02:21:41.480
Well, I don't know if I'm getting anything, but I just had some colds and stuff.

02:21:41.480 --> 02:21:42.480
Maybe I've just been sleeping.

02:21:42.480 --> 02:21:43.480
Okay, uh, I don't know.

02:21:43.480 --> 02:21:44.480
I don't know.

02:21:44.480 --> 02:21:45.480
It's not really too much.

02:21:45.480 --> 02:21:50.480
I'll give a preliminary fuck you to the Sacramento Quark, because they're probably going to make

02:21:50.480 --> 02:21:51.480
me pay the full damn fine.

02:21:51.480 --> 02:21:52.480
But I hope they'll reduce it more easily.

02:21:52.480 --> 02:21:53.480
That was the goodness of everybody.

02:21:53.480 --> 02:21:54.480
I don't know.

02:21:54.480 --> 02:21:55.480
I don't know.

02:21:55.480 --> 02:21:56.480
I don't know.

02:21:56.480 --> 02:21:57.480
I don't know.

02:21:57.480 --> 02:21:58.480
I don't know.

02:21:58.480 --> 02:21:59.480
I don't know.

02:21:59.480 --> 02:22:00.480
I don't know.

02:22:00.480 --> 02:22:04.440
to the sacramento court because they're probably going to make me pay the full damn fine

02:22:04.440 --> 02:22:07.840
but I hope they'll reduce it more easily

02:22:07.840 --> 02:22:09.920
out of the goodness of their hearts

02:22:09.920 --> 02:22:16.920
they have no hearts!

02:22:18.280 --> 02:22:20.640
explicit

02:22:20.640 --> 02:22:22.160
alright

02:22:22.160 --> 02:22:27.740
I've already said most of my FUs from the SPGL tournament

02:22:27.740 --> 02:22:30.320
okay an FU goes to the fog

02:22:30.320 --> 02:22:33.720
God damn, I couldn't even see what the hell I was driving.

02:22:33.720 --> 02:22:40.220
Oh my god, thank god I didn't go to SVGL because I would have cried like a little girl in the fog because I hate fog.

02:22:40.220 --> 02:22:42.320
I really, really hate fog.

02:22:42.320 --> 02:22:49.320
Fe to my friend Patrick for giving me the wrong directions. We almost got lost a few times heading back...

02:22:49.320 --> 02:22:53.320
No, heading to SVGL and heading back again to Sacramento.

02:22:53.320 --> 02:22:54.620
God.

02:22:54.620 --> 02:22:59.620
Either that or just giving Fe to Yahoo maps for messing up the directions.

02:22:59.620 --> 02:23:05.040
FV2MyFriend for misplanning the time management just heading to SVGL, we were supposed to

02:23:05.040 --> 02:23:11.200
be there like around 11.15 as planned, but I had planned earlier, but he wanted me to

02:23:11.200 --> 02:23:16.920
do certain things, therefore causing us to be there around like 11.35 almost being late

02:23:16.920 --> 02:23:20.240
to the whole tournament.

02:23:20.240 --> 02:23:27.040
And I hate to say this, but FV2MyFriend Sean, not Shane, for being to SVGL very late, instead

02:23:27.040 --> 02:23:44.040
He said he went to Milpitas Golf Land, playing in the groove for 30 minutes, when you know there's a big tournament that a friend of ours who was actually at his car, who Hella wanted to compete in his first big tournament and try to shine at his first tournament.

02:23:44.040 --> 02:23:46.040
Yeah, we have an actual...

02:23:46.040 --> 02:23:50.040
You know that's kind of smart to go play in the groove at Milpitas because you know everybody's a Sunnyvale?

02:23:50.040 --> 02:23:56.040
You know Hella is not a word?

02:23:56.040 --> 02:24:02.040
I just needed to point out that somehow or another I managed to spend $111.11 at the grocery store today.

02:24:02.040 --> 02:24:07.040
Thank you for that bit of utter randomness. Back to explicit.

02:24:07.040 --> 02:24:15.040
Okay, an F.U. goes to having four freaking finals the whole week, not getting me enough sleep.

02:24:15.040 --> 02:24:22.040
Damn, finals sucks, but at least it's over with and at least I passed all my fucking classes. Thank God for that.

02:24:22.040 --> 02:24:30.040
And Fv2 people who actually spent $23,000 on a fucking Yu-Gi-Oh card.

02:24:30.040 --> 02:24:38.040
Yes. That is ridiculously stupid. Spending $23,000 on a freaking card.

02:24:38.040 --> 02:24:42.040
When it's going to be released later on as an actual comment.

02:24:42.040 --> 02:24:46.040
Everyone knows that, you know, Pokemon's where it's at.

02:24:46.040 --> 02:24:50.360
yeah three oh yeah how much what I remember I forgot how much spending a

02:24:50.360 --> 02:24:55.360
shitload of money just for three Pikachu's on Pokemon I don't remember but

02:24:55.360 --> 02:24:59.040
I don't give a shit but you could have spent like a Honda Civic or any other

02:24:59.040 --> 02:25:05.240
freaking car rather than spending money on a freaking card who would spend that

02:25:05.240 --> 02:25:10.280
much money a card collector with flots of liquid assets to throw away at any

02:25:10.280 --> 02:25:15.720
whim the person who burns money in his fireplace the person who wipes his ass

02:25:15.720 --> 02:25:22.720
with dollar bills. A person who uses napkins, or actually dollar bills with napkins. Wow.

02:25:25.720 --> 02:25:32.720
A person who eats money. Oh man. Okay, an F-Fute goes to the scar I have on my leg during

02:25:35.720 --> 02:25:42.720
the SVGL3 tournament. I was, I was nonstop bleeding the whole time. Wow, really, and

02:25:42.720 --> 02:25:49.440
really and you didn't die? I didn't die, so I'm still alive. Not poison and stuff and

02:25:49.440 --> 02:25:54.760
all. And F.U. goes to the rest of the drama on SVGL3, of course. Yes, I screwed up on

02:25:54.760 --> 02:26:01.040
the fucking tournament regardless of the patty issues or not. And F.U. goes to AMP, the drink

02:26:01.040 --> 02:26:05.160
AMP, for not keeping me awake the whole time. It says it's supposed to keep me awake just

02:26:05.160 --> 02:26:11.360
like balls does. Well, those assholes were lying to you. I'm sorry there's no substitute

02:26:11.360 --> 02:26:16.160
for balls some good balls down your throat it's just perfect yeah cuz those

02:26:16.160 --> 02:26:20.720
that amp is better well I nearly fell asleep in the wheel and almost got into

02:26:20.720 --> 02:26:28.440
an accident god damn that stimulant for not keeping me away yeah that's how bad

02:26:28.440 --> 02:26:34.400
a freaking amp is oh yeah um the amp 2dx led for being hella either the

02:26:34.400 --> 02:26:39.480
sounds being hella off-sync or just me being off-sync as shit scoring like

02:26:39.480 --> 02:26:44.480
90% goods is not cool, especially for songs that you nearly...

02:26:44.480 --> 02:26:46.480
That's cool for me.

02:26:46.480 --> 02:26:52.480
That's like playing D2R with a full grade attack, which I've nearly done.

02:26:53.480 --> 02:26:55.480
And finally...

02:26:55.480 --> 02:26:57.480
And... Oh no, I'm...

02:26:57.480 --> 02:26:59.480
Wrap it up!

02:26:59.480 --> 02:27:02.480
Oh yeah, of course, FU4 not sleeping, of course.

02:27:02.480 --> 02:27:06.480
FU4 actually cleaning up for fucking Christmas.

02:27:06.480 --> 02:27:09.820
Christmas. I know Christmas is in the house and that's why I'm taking it this week, but

02:27:09.820 --> 02:27:15.240
I shouldn't have been cleaning up the whole week that I had finals for god damn sakes.

02:27:15.240 --> 02:27:18.980
I swear to god you're going to have your own spin-off show where you just sit there. You

02:27:18.980 --> 02:27:22.860
and Dark Child. I'm going to give you guys your own show. It's going to be on at three

02:27:22.860 --> 02:27:29.860
in the morning. So you can get this all out of your system. Now wrap it up.

02:27:29.860 --> 02:27:38.820
stop. Fine. That has to be continued. No, no, never to be continued. Over. Are you in

02:27:38.820 --> 02:27:44.380
the booth or something? What is this sound effect? Why hasn't he tried out for life in

02:27:44.380 --> 02:27:52.460
the real world? I hate my roommates because they annoy me so. Let me count the ways. Damn

02:27:52.460 --> 02:27:59.660
those cameras. Let's fucking break the cameras and blow up the house. Yeah, like I said,

02:27:59.660 --> 02:28:05.620
to be continued. There's no ending of the F.U. raps.

02:28:05.620 --> 02:28:10.620
Chat room time. Misty says F.U. to the cam for being retarded when the presents were

02:28:10.620 --> 02:28:14.280
up. F.U. to the guy that won't answer my text messages. I know that you're pissed at the

02:28:14.280 --> 02:28:17.780
rest of the people that work at the same store, but are you so pissed that you can't even

02:28:17.780 --> 02:28:21.960
answer a text message to let me know you're alright? Damn it, I'm getting worried about

02:28:21.960 --> 02:28:25.980
you. Don't want to break our friendship over something stupid, but if I have to, I will.

02:28:25.980 --> 02:28:34.480
out. Thank you sir. Who needs food? DJ Ron Ma S says, you know what you sound like right

02:28:34.480 --> 02:28:42.980
now is you sound like our old microphone. This is Matt coming to you from two years ago.

02:28:42.980 --> 02:28:49.380
Oh yeah. DJ Ron Ma S says, F you to the idiots on my job for stealing broken iPods. Are you

02:28:49.380 --> 02:28:55.280
that fucking stupid? Another F you to the RIAA MPAA for taking down supernova.org. Groton

02:28:55.280 --> 02:28:56.280
hell, you bastards!

02:28:56.280 --> 02:28:57.280
No, it's bunny-

02:28:57.280 --> 02:29:00.720
Hey! If you actually go to supernova.org and check out the site, it says that they shut

02:29:00.720 --> 02:29:08.240
down due to bandwidth issues, not because of the RIA or MPAA. However, buy-torrent.com.

02:29:08.240 --> 02:29:14.240
That's not B-U-I, but B-I, like bisexual. B-I-torrent.com. And thank me later.

02:29:14.240 --> 02:29:21.600
And all I have to say is, there's something else probably gonna come out that's gonna

02:29:21.600 --> 02:29:22.600
replace BitTorrent anyways.

02:29:22.600 --> 02:29:28.320
I'm coming out of the booth! I'm just using a tonant reactor right now.

02:29:28.320 --> 02:29:35.160
Alright, back to the FUs. And an FU, continuing DTRMS, and an FU to the customer that tried

02:29:35.160 --> 02:29:42.160
to kick my ass for buying the very last mini PS2 in my store. SUCK ON A COLD!

02:29:42.160 --> 02:29:47.160
Stop buying smaller products! God damn it, Sony's trying to do to you what they did,

02:29:47.160 --> 02:29:56.160
Or what Nintendo did with the Game Boy, is release the same shit smaller and with less functionality or whatever.

02:29:56.160 --> 02:30:00.160
That's all a word. I know it. I don't care. I really don't.

02:30:00.160 --> 02:30:05.160
I'm gonna shove that tube up your ass that you're using for the sound effects.

02:30:05.160 --> 02:30:09.160
I'm old school, man.

02:30:09.160 --> 02:30:17.160
Sherlock has an F.U. An F.U. to the Syracuse DDR scene for being a bunch of hypocritical shit talkers.

02:30:17.160 --> 02:30:21.160
You're the reason why I hate going to the local arcades.

02:30:21.160 --> 02:30:29.160
And Jazz says F.U. to Fog. I had to drive via road reflectors last night.

02:30:29.160 --> 02:30:37.160
Dark Sakura sends a message and says I want to offer a fuck you to that sky guy. He really pisses me off. Seriously.

02:30:37.160 --> 02:30:42.160
Screw you, hippie.

02:30:42.160 --> 02:30:49.160
Jaded2004 says, F you to my windows for making it cold in here, because it's 12 degrees outside.

02:30:49.160 --> 02:30:51.160
Oh my god, it's time to move to the Bahamas. Seriously?

02:30:51.160 --> 02:30:53.160
Oh, see ya.

02:30:53.160 --> 02:30:57.160
Sorry.

02:30:57.160 --> 02:30:59.160
Can I see that tube for a minute?

02:30:59.160 --> 02:31:00.160
No.

02:31:00.160 --> 02:31:02.160
No, I want to do the sound effect. No, I want to do the sound effect.

02:31:02.160 --> 02:31:05.160
Come on, let me do the sound effect.

02:31:05.160 --> 02:31:07.160
This is God talking.

02:31:07.160 --> 02:31:10.160
Loki, you need to be punished.

02:31:14.160 --> 02:31:17.160
There's rock germs on it now.

02:31:17.160 --> 02:31:19.160
I frenched it.

02:31:19.160 --> 02:31:23.160
Um, Rychan says F you to the manic depressants that seem to find me,

02:31:23.160 --> 02:31:25.160
and being the person I am,

02:31:25.160 --> 02:31:27.160
listening to their whining and act like their friends.

02:31:27.160 --> 02:31:31.160
F you to my awesome week coming to an end on my birthday.

02:31:31.160 --> 02:31:33.160
F you to myself for crying so much.

02:31:33.160 --> 02:31:41.260
Right-chan needs an orange lounge hug and F you to my ignition pads finally

02:31:41.260 --> 02:31:46.020
biting the dust I loved you guys nine months of accomplishments cry face

02:31:46.020 --> 02:31:50.940
illusion says F you to this crazy lady that was honking at us and flipping us

02:31:50.940 --> 02:31:55.740
off as we headed home from Knott's Berry Farm last night okay hold on I have two

02:31:55.740 --> 02:32:01.180
issues with that a when you're in so Cal that's the way everybody drives down

02:32:01.180 --> 02:32:05.600
there. You're all fucking nuts. And B, what the hell are you doing at Knott's Berry Farm?

02:32:05.600 --> 02:32:09.280
Dude, that place rocks. You can make your own candles.

02:32:09.280 --> 02:32:15.000
Knott's Berry Farm. I don't know about now, but I don't know about you, man, the laughing

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:18.560
stock of theme parks. I don't know about you, but how come they have a theme park based

02:32:18.560 --> 02:32:28.560
around jelly? I mean, really. Jellyland. With Snoopy and his jelly bandits. It's like an

02:32:28.560 --> 02:32:33.580
overrated like I don't even know what all right illusion continues f you to

02:32:33.580 --> 02:32:38.700
myself for being too greedy to want to pay my own hard-earned money on other

02:32:38.700 --> 02:32:50.380
people and emphasis on hard and f you to televangelism and lastly Poto says f you

02:32:50.380 --> 02:32:55.200
to imbalanced paladins in the world of Warcraft I'm tired of killing the thing

02:32:55.200 --> 02:33:01.740
three times. Well, don't play World of Warcraft. And another F.U. to Loki for that Virgin Mary

02:33:01.740 --> 02:33:08.740
comment. Just kidding. But do F.U. to not say, and I quote, J.K., but do F.U. to not

02:33:10.540 --> 02:33:17.540
saying Merry Christmas, everyone. Christmas? Get it? No, no, no. Get it? Christmas? I don't

02:33:47.540 --> 02:33:52.940
to do it, right? Sure, why not? Loki, you're going to do it. Yes. And I'm going to do it.

02:33:52.940 --> 02:34:00.020
Angel, are you going to do it? And why don't you two share? The couch gets to share. You

02:34:00.020 --> 02:34:04.580
know what? No. I changed my mind. Arcadian gets to do it by himself. Jonas, you don't

02:34:04.580 --> 02:34:09.580
get to do it because you were late. But if you want to do it late, or if you want to

02:34:09.580 --> 02:34:14.700
do it... Jonas is late. Is he pregnant? If you want to help Arcadian, you can. Alright.

02:34:14.700 --> 02:34:18.720
The way Listless works, ok we haven't done Listless in a long time but the way Listless

02:34:18.720 --> 02:34:23.200
works because you know how we have this obsession in our society where we have to create the

02:34:23.200 --> 02:34:28.620
top list. Like we have to have the top 3 of all time. Actually can I have the tube? Can

02:34:28.620 --> 02:34:36.100
I have the tube for a minute? It's the top 3 of all time. My god, we're so sad now that

02:34:36.100 --> 02:34:40.580
we use the tube as a special effect. Alright. So we're gonna come up with the top 3 list

02:34:40.580 --> 02:34:43.980
of all time. And the top 3 list we're gonna do tonight, tonight's topic, and I'm gonna

02:34:43.980 --> 02:34:46.820
to give you guys the break to come up with it. If you guys in the chat room

02:34:46.820 --> 02:34:51.460
have suggestions, you can start posting there in the chat room www.orensontrader.com.

02:34:51.460 --> 02:34:56.100
Okay, top three. Here it is. This is inspired by a chat that some folks in

02:34:56.100 --> 02:35:02.460
the chat room were having before the show. Beatmania 2DX. Rumor is that

02:35:02.460 --> 02:35:06.460
someday, somehow, they're going to bring it over to the USA, but they can't really

02:35:06.460 --> 02:35:12.980
call it Beatmania 2DX because there was no Beatmania DX. Now, you can't really

02:35:12.980 --> 02:35:19.400
call it hip-hop mania either because that's gay. So, we have to come up with a new name

02:35:19.400 --> 02:35:25.260
for Beatmania 2DX. So tonight we're gonna come up with the top three names for Beatmania

02:35:25.260 --> 02:35:33.260
2DX in America of all time. Your head does not have the water for properties of the tube!

02:35:33.260 --> 02:35:42.960
Okay, remember guys, top three names for Beatmania 2DX's American release of all time. Now if

02:35:42.960 --> 02:35:46.840
course, to humor those people that are going to get out there and go,

02:35:46.840 --> 02:35:50.160
well, you know, Orange Lounge Radio, you fags,

02:35:50.160 --> 02:35:54.640
what they should do is just call it Beatmania 2DX.

02:35:54.640 --> 02:35:58.680
Who cares? Okay, I understand that.

02:35:58.680 --> 02:36:04.080
Speaking of that, my stipulation, though, is that nobody can pick Beatmania 2DX as the title.

02:36:04.080 --> 02:36:07.760
Yeah, that's a given. And nobody can say Hip-Hop Mania 2, either.

02:36:07.760 --> 02:36:08.680
Be more creative.

02:36:08.680 --> 02:36:12.560
Actually, I hear people call it Beatmania 2DX, Be Me A Two Dicks.

02:36:12.560 --> 02:36:17.560
So okay, beat me with two dicks. Is that what you just said? Beat me with two dicks. Beat you with two dicks? I can have that arranged.

02:36:17.560 --> 02:36:20.560
Alright. Not by me of course. Alright.

02:36:24.560 --> 02:36:25.560
Quiet.

02:36:28.560 --> 02:36:34.560
Alright, so just humor us a little bit you guys. We're coming up with new names, okay? Alright.

02:36:35.560 --> 02:36:41.560
In the meantime, we're going to go to a break featuring some tracks from Beatmania 2DX. Go figure.

02:36:41.560 --> 02:36:45.280
I mean, who knew that I would want to choose those kinds of songs?

02:36:45.280 --> 02:36:46.280
You want to hear the safari?

02:36:46.280 --> 02:36:47.280
You want to hear the safari?

02:36:47.280 --> 02:36:50.560
Alright, we'll do the safari, because the safari has been in like every two years.

02:36:50.560 --> 02:36:51.560
Alright, we'll be back.

02:43:50.560 --> 02:44:20.520
Hello everybody and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

02:44:20.520 --> 02:44:22.560
We're about to get this listless segment underway.

02:44:22.560 --> 02:44:27.480
Remember that we are trying to find the top three names

02:44:27.480 --> 02:44:30.960
that they could call Beatmania 2DX

02:44:30.960 --> 02:44:32.360
if they released it in the US,

02:44:32.360 --> 02:44:34.640
because you can't call it 2DX,

02:44:34.640 --> 02:44:36.320
because there was no one.

02:44:36.320 --> 02:44:37.440
Of course, then you could argue

02:44:37.440 --> 02:44:39.260
that HipHopMania would be the name,

02:44:39.260 --> 02:44:41.560
but that's gay, so we're not gonna call it that either.

02:44:41.560 --> 02:44:44.700
So we're gonna find a new name for it here.

02:44:46.640 --> 02:44:49.400
Or for anybody that plays Final Fantasy XI with me,

02:44:49.400 --> 02:44:50.400
It's so teets.

02:44:50.400 --> 02:44:51.400
Alright.

02:44:51.400 --> 02:44:52.400
Yes.

02:44:52.400 --> 02:44:53.400
What?

02:44:53.400 --> 02:44:54.400
Yes.

02:44:54.400 --> 02:44:55.400
Dark Saturday.

02:44:55.400 --> 02:44:56.400
You need.

02:44:56.400 --> 02:44:57.400
It's right.

02:44:57.400 --> 02:44:58.400
Well, you threw it on the floor.

02:44:58.400 --> 02:44:59.400
Somebody did.

02:44:59.400 --> 02:45:00.400

02:45:00.400 --> 02:45:01.400

02:45:01.400 --> 02:45:02.400
Addict.

02:45:02.400 --> 02:45:14.720
Then again, I'm over here chatting with two people about PSL.

02:45:14.720 --> 02:45:15.720
I know.

02:45:15.720 --> 02:45:16.720
You're like, oh, I'm going to go home.

02:45:17.720 --> 02:45:24.720
I'm going to try to find some game show music here but I don't know if I have anything.

02:45:27.400 --> 02:45:28.160
Damn it!

02:45:28.160 --> 02:45:30.160
Price is Right music!

02:45:30.160 --> 02:45:33.400
I kind of have Price is Right music. Actually I do have an idea of what we can do.

02:45:33.400 --> 02:45:35.560
We need Plinko music!

02:45:35.560 --> 02:45:38.600
There is no Plinko music!

02:45:38.600 --> 02:45:40.480
We need the yodeling one.

02:45:40.480 --> 02:45:43.800
Do you know which one that is?

02:45:43.800 --> 02:45:50.800

I can't believe it's not B-Mania 2DX!

02:47:12.160 --> 02:47:19.160
I can't believe it's not B-Mania 2DX!

02:47:20.120 --> 02:47:21.600
Why that name?

02:47:21.600 --> 02:47:23.540
Any reason why?

02:47:23.540 --> 02:47:25.600
Because it's not.

02:47:25.600 --> 02:47:26.400
Loki!

02:47:26.400 --> 02:47:28.280
You're number three.

02:47:28.280 --> 02:47:31.480
Super Toast!

02:47:31.480 --> 02:47:32.960
Super Toast!

02:47:32.960 --> 02:47:35.440
Any reason why you're calling it Super Toast?

02:47:35.440 --> 02:47:42.440
That was better than normal toast.

02:47:42.440 --> 02:47:45.440
All right, DDR Angel, you're number three.

02:47:45.440 --> 02:47:49.440
She needs more time. You got a number three at least? You got one?

02:47:49.440 --> 02:47:53.440
Okay, Jamie can scream at it now.

02:47:53.440 --> 02:47:54.440
What?

02:47:54.440 --> 02:47:56.440
Because, it's funny.

02:47:56.440 --> 02:48:00.440
Okay, I don't know if Rob's gonna laugh when he's DDR-ing so it's not good.

02:48:00.440 --> 02:48:01.440
Just say it already.

02:48:01.440 --> 02:48:03.440
Spinning Totomaster.

02:48:03.440 --> 02:48:04.440
Spinning what?

02:48:04.440 --> 02:48:05.440
No, that's not right.

02:48:05.440 --> 02:48:06.440
Spinning Tarumania.

02:48:06.440 --> 02:48:07.440
Spinning Tarumania!

02:48:07.440 --> 02:48:19.040
Why would I laugh at a Final Fantasy XI joke?

02:48:19.040 --> 02:48:20.040
Alright.

02:48:20.040 --> 02:48:21.840
There's a lot of games out there.

02:48:21.840 --> 02:48:27.840
My number three pick, because I was thinking that they want to actually sell copies of

02:48:27.840 --> 02:48:31.840
this game, so they'd have to borrow from another franchise, so my number three pick for a name

02:48:31.840 --> 02:48:47.460
would be rumbleroses2. Rumbleroses2! Alright, uh, Arcadian42 and explicit, what number three

02:48:47.460 --> 02:48:52.120
name did you come up with? We're gonna do it separately. Can we? You can do it separately,

02:48:52.120 --> 02:48:56.560
that's fine. Alright, you're number three Arcadian. Okay, uh, I'm planning to do it

02:48:56.560 --> 02:49:09.320
Americans it's like keys and stuff it's it's like keys and stuff all right

02:49:09.320 --> 02:49:18.160
explicit your number three pick number three pick would be beatbox revolution

02:49:18.160 --> 02:49:24.160
Beatbox Revolution! Any reason why?

02:49:24.160 --> 02:49:27.160
Okay, that's gross sounding.

02:49:27.160 --> 02:49:29.160
I explained it.

02:49:29.160 --> 02:49:35.160
Alright, let's go on to our number two picks, starting off with Jamie.

02:49:35.160 --> 02:49:37.160
Button Smashing Game.

02:49:37.160 --> 02:49:43.160
Button Smashing Game!

02:49:43.160 --> 02:49:46.160
Loki, your number two pick.

02:49:46.160 --> 02:50:02.140
I would go with he puts a lot of work into this you guys it's gonna be how

02:50:02.140 --> 02:50:09.140

02:50:09.140 --> 02:50:10.140

02:50:10.140 --> 02:50:12.140
Alright, Angel, your number two pick.

02:50:13.640 --> 02:50:14.640

Ah! DJ Spin Master.

02:50:17.140 --> 02:50:19.640
DJ Spin Master!

02:50:25.140 --> 02:50:30.640
My number two pick, again going with the theme of they actually want to sell copies of this game in the US, would be...

02:50:31.140 --> 02:50:34.140
MTV presents Britney Mania 2005.

02:50:34.140 --> 02:50:37.140
Cuz they can- Brit mania for short.

02:50:43.140 --> 02:50:48.140
Alright, moving on. Let's go to Arcadian42.

02:51:02.140 --> 02:51:04.140
mix it up!

02:51:04.140 --> 02:51:06.140
Any reason why?

02:51:06.140 --> 02:51:10.140
Well, since everyone's talking about the losses with the DDR public scene,

02:51:10.140 --> 02:51:12.140
maybe they'll come out with a fire back saying,

02:51:12.140 --> 02:51:15.140
let's call it mix it up, so let's go pump it up's name.

02:51:15.140 --> 02:51:19.140
Oh, okay, we'll play on pump it up there, I got it, alright.

02:51:19.140 --> 02:51:24.140
Alright, let's see, Jamie, your number one pick, number one!

02:51:24.140 --> 02:51:29.140

Pretend you're a real DJ, but not!

02:51:34.140 --> 02:51:38.140
Is it but not or but you're not?

02:51:38.140 --> 02:51:42.140
I'll have that, but not really.

02:51:42.140 --> 02:51:46.140
Pretend you're a real DJ, but not really!

02:51:46.140 --> 02:51:49.140
Loki, you're number one.

02:51:49.140 --> 02:51:53.140
I have to think long and hard on this, okay?

02:51:53.140 --> 02:51:58.140
It's Super Monkey Wombat cheese burrito.

02:51:58.140 --> 02:52:01.140
Super Monkey Wombat Cheese Burrito!

02:52:07.140 --> 02:52:13.140
Any particular reason why you want to call a video game with falling bars, uh, Super Monkey Wombat Cheese Burrito?

02:52:16.140 --> 02:52:17.140
Because it fits.

02:52:17.140 --> 02:52:18.140
You're an idiot.

02:52:18.140 --> 02:52:20.140
Alright, Angel!

02:52:20.140 --> 02:52:24.140
Well if he's an idiot, my next one's not that much better, but I thought it was funny.

02:52:24.140 --> 02:52:30.760
from a total noobs perspective oh shit there's too much to do the game oh shit

02:52:30.760 --> 02:52:35.260
there's too much to do the game

02:52:40.860 --> 02:52:47.380
my number one pick my number one pick I think really encompasses what the game

02:52:47.380 --> 02:52:52.340
is really all about because I've been playing the money for a long long time

02:52:52.340 --> 02:52:56.580
and I've been looking at the forums and everything and I think I've captured the name that really

02:52:56.580 --> 02:53:05.420
shows what this game is all about. So my number one pick, Elitist Elitist Revolution. Elitist

02:53:05.420 --> 02:53:12.420
the greatest, elitist revolution!

02:53:14.020 --> 02:53:16.380
Arcadian42, your number one pick.

TurntablistKing.

02:53:23.180 --> 02:53:28.140
TurntablistKing!

02:53:28.140 --> 02:53:34.140

02:53:34.140 --> 02:53:40.020
Okay, cuz, I like that. Alright, uh, Jonas AKA explicit, your number one pick.

02:53:40.020 --> 02:53:45.740

02:54:05.540 --> 02:54:11.700

02:54:43.160 --> 02:54:46.000
sadly has to come off the list. What's coming off?

02:54:46.000 --> 02:54:53.000
Super Toast. Super Toast is Toast.

02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:56.000
Loki, which one of these is coming off the list?

02:54:56.000 --> 02:55:06.000
Sadly, Beatbox Revolution, because there is a beatboxing game coming out, and that's not beatboxing.

02:55:06.000 --> 02:55:09.000
And that's another reason either.

02:55:09.000 --> 02:55:15.000
Alright, Angel, which one of these has to come off the list?

02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:19.400
It's like keys and stuff.

02:55:19.400 --> 02:55:23.280
It's like keys and stuff, off the list.

02:55:23.280 --> 02:55:28.040
I have to eliminate, sadly, sorry Angel, but spinning Tarou mania has got to come off the

02:55:28.040 --> 02:55:29.040
list.

02:55:29.040 --> 02:55:32.880
As much as I love Final Fantasy XI, even 2DX isn't that good.

02:55:32.880 --> 02:55:33.880
I know, I know.

02:55:33.880 --> 02:55:37.960
Alright, Arcanium 42, what's coming off the list?

02:55:37.960 --> 02:55:41.720
Britney whatever thing, it's like so over.

02:55:41.720 --> 02:55:49.720
MTV presents Britney Mania 2005 because, in the words of Arkadian42, it's so over.

02:55:50.720 --> 02:55:52.720
Alright.

02:55:53.720 --> 02:55:55.720
Britney is so last year, okay?

02:55:55.720 --> 02:55:57.720
Yeah, like, like totally.

02:55:58.720 --> 02:56:03.720
I'm gonna get on the forums and tell those orange orange radio people that Britney is so 2003, okay?

02:56:04.720 --> 02:56:07.720
Jonas, you're the last one to get to eliminate something off the list. What is it?

02:56:07.720 --> 02:56:12.720
I hate to say this, but I'll have to say Rumble Roses 2.

02:56:12.720 --> 02:56:13.720
You bastard!

02:56:13.720 --> 02:56:17.240
That was the best name on there.

02:56:17.240 --> 02:56:21.440
Rumble Roses 2 is off the list.

02:56:21.440 --> 02:56:22.440
Alright.

02:56:22.440 --> 02:56:25.440

Orange Lounge Radio, the post show or the after birth as we so lovingly called it for

03:10:36.840 --> 03:10:40.640
these past two and a half years where we talk about all that other stuff that we didn't

03:10:40.640 --> 03:10:44.080
get too quiet on the show. I can't believe we've been doing it this long. Oh my god,

03:10:44.080 --> 03:10:48.800
it's seriously time to quit. Ah, stop quitting. No, I'm kidding, no. Quitter, quitter. We'll

03:10:48.800 --> 03:10:51.560
be doing this right now. You know I got a fortune cookie today, it was really weird,

03:10:51.560 --> 03:10:54.680
it said something about like, something you are focusing on, and I was thinking about

03:10:54.680 --> 03:10:58.760
Orange Laundry when I read it, it said something you are focusing on, it will grow a lot in

03:10:58.760 --> 03:11:03.720
this next year. It'll be very interesting to see what happens. Although we have a really

03:11:03.720 --> 03:11:07.160
boring webcam, we seriously need to start pointing that somewhere else, like, we need

03:11:07.160 --> 03:11:11.360
to get a goldfish or something you know when you're reading that fortune I was

03:11:11.360 --> 03:11:14.520
thinking of my penis so

03:11:14.880 --> 03:11:18.600
because you know you weren't here and stuff I had so much food today I went to

03:11:18.600 --> 03:11:24.200
Panda Express I ate like a three combo did you break the webcam way to go I'm

03:11:24.200 --> 03:11:32.020
so awesome that wasn't Jamie that was me if you can believe it you're belchy I

03:11:32.020 --> 03:11:32.520
I know.

03:11:32.520 --> 03:11:33.720
I am going home, bye!

03:11:33.720 --> 03:11:36.020
You're going home? Fine.

03:11:36.020 --> 03:11:38.020
I have to go home to my life.

03:11:38.020 --> 03:11:40.020
Hey, you're going to E3s next year, right?

03:11:40.020 --> 03:11:41.020
Well, yeah.

03:11:41.020 --> 03:11:44.020
If we end up deciding to go to The Price is Right, will you go?

03:11:44.020 --> 03:11:49.520
Cause, hearing Come on Down made me think of, you know, when I went to The Price is Right a couple years ago. It was so much fun.

03:11:49.520 --> 03:11:50.520
Sure.

03:11:50.520 --> 03:11:52.020
And, Loki, you're gonna go too?

03:11:52.020 --> 03:11:53.520
I have to go before he dies.

03:11:53.520 --> 03:11:55.020
Oh my god, I found a contestant.

03:11:55.020 --> 03:11:56.020
We all have to wear-

03:11:56.020 --> 03:12:00.020
Oh my god, if you were a contestant on that show, I'd pee myself, because you'd be so shy.

03:12:00.020 --> 03:12:01.020
I'd pee if I go-

03:12:01.020 --> 03:12:05.020
I'd be like, yeah. Oh my god!

03:12:05.020 --> 03:12:09.020
I wouldn't be one of those screamy, happy, clappy people. Hi, hi! You girls are ugly!

03:12:09.020 --> 03:12:13.020
I wouldn't be one of those screamy, happy, clappy people.

03:12:13.020 --> 03:12:17.020
I'd be like, wow.

03:12:17.020 --> 03:12:21.020
I suppose I'd pick this. You'd have an orgasm and you know it. No I wouldn't.

03:12:21.020 --> 03:12:25.020
Don't touch me. Oh my god, you're orange.

03:12:25.020 --> 03:12:29.020
I want to go, and we all should wear matching shirts.

03:12:29.020 --> 03:12:32.260
We can hype it up on the station and have it be the big Orange Launch Radio Television

03:12:32.260 --> 03:12:33.260
debut.

03:12:33.260 --> 03:12:34.260
As an internet radio.

03:12:34.260 --> 03:12:35.260
Weird.

03:12:35.260 --> 03:12:36.260
Well, we'll hype it up.

03:12:36.260 --> 03:12:37.900
The Orange Launch Radio Television debut.

03:12:37.900 --> 03:12:38.900
I like that idea.

03:12:38.900 --> 03:12:39.900
Okay.

03:12:39.900 --> 03:12:40.900
Alright.

03:12:40.900 --> 03:12:41.900
We'll see what happens.

03:12:41.900 --> 03:12:44.860
Except when one of us walks behind the G4 camera.

Have a good night, Jamie.

And anybody else want to add anything?

03:12:51.820 --> 03:12:55.620
Now you're dying to see The Price is Right live in person, aren't you, somebody looking?

03:12:55.620 --> 03:12:59.620
I watched that show since I've been five.

03:12:59.620 --> 03:13:02.620
Oh, really? What was on it last week?

03:13:02.620 --> 03:13:08.620
It was some white trash bastard winning a Buick or something, I don't know.

03:13:08.620 --> 03:13:09.620
Perfect!

03:13:09.620 --> 03:13:11.620
Wow, you got it! I'm amazed!

03:13:11.620 --> 03:13:14.620
Alright, bye Jamie, have a good night, and you know what?

03:13:14.620 --> 03:13:16.620
Good night to the rest of you guys, too. Have a good one.
