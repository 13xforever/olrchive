02:26.800 --> 02:30.800

02:30.800 --> 02:32.800
No, you can't let them keep you.

02:32.800 --> 02:44.800
But I had grits. Real grits. I ate at the waffle house. And I had my hash brown, smothered, covered chunks and dice. Thank you.

03:25.800 --> 03:27.800
Hi. It's not a game that's easy.

03:27.800 --> 03:28.800
What?

03:28.800 --> 03:30.800
It's not a game that's easy.

03:30.800 --> 03:34.800
What? I want to talk about that when we come back. That is crazy.

03:34.800 --> 03:37.800
Because we just had an 80's preshow and it kind of ties into that.

03:37.800 --> 03:39.800
That little thing you're playing right there.

03:39.800 --> 03:43.400
Uh, yeah, we got a whole lot of interesting stuff to talk about tonight.

03:43.400 --> 03:45.800
Actually, I'm lying. There's really not a whole lot going on.

03:45.800 --> 03:48.200
But we're gonna try to film three hours best we can anyway.

03:48.200 --> 03:52.400
Um, I know I want to talk about 8 style tonight, Pop Music 10,

03:52.400 --> 03:54.600
because I got to play both those this week for the first time.

03:54.600 --> 03:57.800
Of course, How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day, Cage Match, all that fun stuff.

03:57.800 --> 04:03.200
When we come back after this break, featuring music from DDR Third Mix,

04:17.800 --> 04:21.800
Some of the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.

04:21.800 --> 04:24.800
Um, Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music

04:24.800 --> 04:27.800
in our Bamani Music and More program. Can we talk about that?

04:27.800 --> 04:29.800
No subject will ever be taboo.

04:29.800 --> 04:33.800
Well, I was thinking maybe we should move, pump up the volume from Tuesday nights?

04:33.800 --> 04:36.800
Except, of course, the subject that was just on your discussion.

04:36.800 --> 04:42.800
Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the attack music we play on the station?

04:42.800 --> 04:44.800
I collect your fucking head.

04:45.800 --> 04:47.800
Just like this fucker here.

04:49.800 --> 04:56.800
Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki? The Hawk thing on episode 69 was just a joke!

04:56.800 --> 05:03.800
Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!

05:03.800 --> 05:10.800
Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.

05:10.800 --> 05:15.800
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

05:15.800 --> 05:19.800
The lovely and wonderful Jamie there in that promo, well, sort of.

05:19.800 --> 05:21.800
Ashplained by Lucy Liu.

05:21.800 --> 05:23.800
Yes, you remember that a long time ago.

05:23.800 --> 05:26.800
This was like probably the first year of Orange Lounge Radio,

05:26.800 --> 05:30.800
which it's sad that that could be considered retro, but it really is.

05:30.800 --> 05:34.200
really is. You remember way back during the first year of this program when somebody had

05:34.200 --> 05:37.700
talked about, I want to say it was Dark Tetsuya who was somehow involved with this, brought

05:37.700 --> 05:43.660
up the casting of the Orange Lounge movie, and they took votes in the chat room and they

05:43.660 --> 05:48.540
said that you should be played by Lucy Liu. How ironic. Which is, yeah, how ironic. A

05:48.540 --> 05:55.820
little too ironic. Especially considering you're not Asian at all. No. You know what?

05:55.820 --> 05:59.620
I finally got something new when I went to Alabama. That would be like me being played

05:59.620 --> 06:07.020
by Denzel Washington. That's funny. Anyway, sorry. Yes, Alabama. I got, I believe it was,

06:07.020 --> 06:12.060
I thought you were taller. Alright, this is a good segue, we've got to get into how was

06:12.060 --> 06:15.620
your week, how was your day, because I've got to figure out about what this is all about.

06:15.620 --> 06:20.260
So, Jamie, how was your week, how was your day? A couple of weeks were pretty decent.

06:20.260 --> 06:27.980
Very, very, very, very, very, very busy. Let's see, with my trip to Alabama, I got there,

06:27.980 --> 06:31.300
My mom got us lost and away from New Orleans.

06:31.300 --> 06:35.060
We ended up heading up toward Hattiesburg.

06:35.060 --> 06:36.500
There's something stuck in this thing.

06:36.500 --> 06:39.020
Anyway, we ended up going up to Hattiesburg.

06:39.020 --> 06:40.860
And then right when mom realized where we were,

06:40.860 --> 06:44.620
we had to go around a different way, so we headed home.

06:44.620 --> 06:45.180
Got there.

06:45.180 --> 06:47.860
I didn't get done until 6 in the morning Central.

06:47.860 --> 06:50.740
That means I had been up an official 24 hours,

06:50.740 --> 06:53.420
because I woke up at 4 Pacific in the morning.

06:53.420 --> 06:55.420
Congratulations.

06:55.420 --> 06:57.140
My house crashed.

06:57.140 --> 07:03.400
next day was Thanksgiving but we didn't do Thanksgiving stuff we just slept and

07:03.400 --> 07:10.000
did some hanging out you know it's pretty cool then on Friday I went to

07:10.000 --> 07:15.240
Dothan saw my daddy my uncle Dale my uncle Dale and my daddy are having their

07:15.240 --> 07:22.220
second childhoods my uncle Dale has a aka midlife crisis 2004 Mustang GT my

07:22.220 --> 07:49.420
I used to be that way on AOL Instant Messenger, I would type to everybody in a huge 72-point

07:49.420 --> 07:55.540
font they'd be like knock it off but I figured my chats are very important and

07:55.540 --> 08:03.140
I want to make sure they're not missed well this is Saturday um I we had our

08:03.140 --> 08:08.980
official Thanksgiving at my uncle's house and we had fried turkey mmm

08:08.980 --> 08:13.820
fried turkey you know what turkey dangerous that shit is to make so yeah

08:13.820 --> 08:18.940
well my uncle had a very nice deep fryer with the lid and everything and it was

08:18.940 --> 08:23.500
very gummy cuz it makes all of the meat just super juicy and had all kinds of

08:23.500 --> 08:26.780
things I'm not supposed to eat. On the way to Dothan though I had boiled peanuts

08:26.780 --> 08:32.380
and I passed by two movie galleries and saluted them for you Loki. Like you know

08:32.380 --> 08:41.380
the single finger salute. Yes. But I had a really good time and then that night I went to

08:41.380 --> 08:49.620
ground zero which is a sort of okay it's like a it's a comic book store with

08:49.620 --> 08:53.460
gaming tables there are lots of people playing Yu-Gi-Oh! and I felt really nerdy

08:53.460 --> 08:58.220
and then but down downstairs there's like an arcade there was pretty cool

08:58.220 --> 09:04.180
that's a very strange name for a arcade in light of recent events isn't it great

09:04.180 --> 09:18.700
okay but there was a DDR extreme there was a fourth solo there was a fourth

09:18.700 --> 09:23.740
solo that's hard there was a virtual on I played the hell out of virtual on and

09:23.740 --> 09:28.780
a super pac-man oh my god so one of my favorite and I had a dance maniacs oh

09:28.780 --> 09:35.780
I met quite a few people, actually I met the, uh, I don't remember the name of the show,

09:58.780 --> 10:03.020
I'm supposing that he's in charge of the machines there, he goes by, uh,

10:03.020 --> 10:04.480
Pyramus Online.

10:04.480 --> 10:08.260
Very, very cool guy. I went to a... I went to a Bemani party!

10:08.260 --> 10:11.420
What? You went to a Bemani party? Yeah.

10:11.420 --> 10:16.580
You just randomly got invited to a Bemani party? They were all heading over, so I went over and played Ace Style

10:16.580 --> 10:21.100
on a widescreen TV, and that was rad. Very nice. So, you just...

10:21.100 --> 10:26.380
You went over to strangers' houses to play video games? He actually lived, um, about a block away from

10:26.380 --> 10:28.540
where my ex-remates lived.

10:28.540 --> 10:30.460
So it was very close.

10:30.460 --> 10:36.660
And I went over, of course, to hang out with my mama's son and my papa's son,

10:36.660 --> 10:40.780
and Kay Kitty and Bobby, and we had a pretty good time.

10:40.780 --> 10:41.780
We watched movies.

10:41.780 --> 10:48.340
I saw The End of the Day After Tomorrow, and no offense, but that movie sucked.

10:48.340 --> 10:49.340
I don't think so.

10:49.340 --> 10:51.340
That's my very professional opinion.

10:51.340 --> 10:54.220
I don't know a lot of people who are going to disagree with you there.

10:54.220 --> 10:55.220
My mom loves the movie.

10:55.220 --> 10:56.220
They love the movie.

10:56.220 --> 11:00.220
I don't really want to put down anyone else's opinion of it, but my opinion of it is crap.

11:02.220 --> 11:04.220
We also, uh...

11:04.220 --> 11:08.220
I learned the fine art of DVD duplication.

11:08.220 --> 11:12.220
And so I was able to deliver a copy of Kill Bill volume 2.

11:12.220 --> 11:14.220
Orange Laundraider does not advocate piracy.

11:14.220 --> 11:16.220
Yes he did.

11:16.220 --> 11:18.220
And I got, uh...

11:18.220 --> 11:22.220
Actually, you know, there's that show, uh, Kindred Be Embraced that came on

11:22.220 --> 11:25.220
based off of the White Wolf universe that I have.

11:25.220 --> 11:29.540
since they ever made it that because I think that the actor died the main guy

11:29.540 --> 11:35.580
who's playing the prince but I have all of that I still have it on my uh the

11:35.580 --> 11:42.020
one brings me DVDs you'll get copies um orange is not advocate piracy it's

11:42.020 --> 11:46.660
actually that they're not I'm just teasing they're not licensing I want to

11:46.660 --> 11:49.560
find out more about this Bomani party because basically you went over to a

11:49.560 --> 11:56.040
a stranger's house. I sang, Rob. People that stalk us on the internet, right?

11:56.040 --> 11:58.400
You gotta find the... A few people in the listeners.

11:58.400 --> 12:02.000
Yes, okay, so message to our listeners, stalking us works, and...

12:02.000 --> 12:06.440
I was hanging out with a lot of the people, though, were people from DDR Freak.

12:06.440 --> 12:10.840
Well, no, that's cool. But, I mean, you've got the moderatorship

12:10.840 --> 12:14.280
on DDR Freak, so a lot of people know who you are over there, and then, you know, we're

12:14.280 --> 12:18.080
starting... The show's getting pretty big over there, thanks to the syndication on Friday

12:18.080 --> 12:22.800
nights over there on freak radio so well um it was just a bunch of people I met a

12:22.800 --> 12:28.120
lot of good people um we I mean we basically were just playing eight style

12:28.120 --> 12:34.440
played uh now I brought out karaoke revolution now you don't sing karaoke I

12:34.440 --> 12:39.400
don't but I got the line from the adventures and babysitting nobody leaves

12:39.400 --> 12:44.380
without singing the blues and and that's all it took you didn't they didn't have

12:44.380 --> 12:49.580
to feature Guinness or anything? I was begged. They didn't make a drink Guinness or anything?

12:49.580 --> 12:52.580
You just did it perfectly sober? I was just thinking it was going to be about another

12:52.580 --> 12:57.820
year before I'm back. And you knew that there were no recording devices present. So I sang

12:57.820 --> 13:01.820
Bizarre Love Triangle. Oh no, that's a good song. Yeah. Now see, you missed some karaoke

13:01.820 --> 13:11.820
action here on the show last week. No, I didn't miss it, I'm sorry. Thing, right. No, I actually,

13:11.820 --> 13:17.300
Loki's still pissed at me over it by the way. I actually was gonna be the

13:17.300 --> 13:23.380
trying to tune in on my laptop but um I had promised my mama son I was gonna

13:23.380 --> 13:28.980
take her to see The Grudge which after having since I was glad I saw Julian

13:28.980 --> 13:34.620
first very glad I saw at first because then um it was neat noting the

13:34.620 --> 13:37.540
differences in the movie I'm not gonna spoil it for anyone who hasn't and

13:37.540 --> 13:41.380
actually the thing is that pissed me off is that I don't know the reason why they

13:41.380 --> 13:46.020
think they have to explain every single last fucking detail to a U.S. audience, when it's

13:46.020 --> 13:50.900
the not knowing that is the messed up part of the movie. Even so, I thought it was very

13:50.900 --> 13:59.260
good, and even better, especially since it was done by the original director. So, we

13:59.260 --> 14:03.260
did that. I went to Steak and Shake. Steak and Shake is the best place ever.

14:03.260 --> 14:05.140
What? Steak and Shake...

14:05.140 --> 14:07.980
Only in the South, would you have a place called Steak and Shake?

14:07.980 --> 14:12.420
it's these thick hamburgers really good it's like a little diner type place but

14:12.420 --> 14:15.800
you can get these humongous milkshakes they make a half-and-half but it's

14:15.800 --> 14:19.260
literally split down the middle half one side is one flavor half the other is the

14:19.260 --> 14:25.620
other so I actually mixed it up and had banana eggnog huh oh god it was good

14:25.620 --> 14:33.060
that was orgasm in the glass anyway no it didn't taste like tuna

14:33.060 --> 14:35.660
She's like, banana and egg mugs.

14:35.660 --> 14:36.900
Damn it.

14:36.900 --> 14:41.820
Anyway, I got to meet lots of good people,

14:41.820 --> 14:45.020
had a really good time.

14:45.020 --> 14:48.940
Monday, my brother was being an ass the whole time.

14:48.940 --> 14:53.860
So he's, yeah, I'm not too proud of my brother, Matthew.

14:53.860 --> 14:56.660
But I talked to my brother, Phil, while I was there.

14:56.660 --> 15:07.020
He's supposed to be down for Christmas, I think, and he's getting married.

15:07.020 --> 15:08.580
Well, he's already married.

15:08.580 --> 15:12.260
This is my brother who's a Marine, and his life's a Marine,

15:12.260 --> 15:18.340
and they're actually going to Texas to have a humongous big Mexican wedding.

15:18.340 --> 15:22.260
I'm going to go, because this is going to be a big party.

15:22.260 --> 15:24.320
Will there be margaritas involved?

15:24.320 --> 15:24.820
Likely.

15:24.820 --> 15:26.420
Awesome.

15:26.420 --> 15:30.420
Actually, people that know me pretty well know that I'm actually not a big tequila fan.

15:30.420 --> 15:34.420
I'll drink margaritas because you can barely taste the tequila, but I cannot stand straight-up tequila.

15:34.420 --> 15:38.420
You know, you had that cheap shit here.

15:38.420 --> 15:42.420
But I still don't like tequila. You can give me Cuervo, I don't care, I still don't like it.

15:42.420 --> 15:45.420
I can do shots of tequila. I think it's nasty unless...

15:45.420 --> 15:48.420
I like the Bula Gave tequila.

15:48.420 --> 15:58.740
that uh the stuff that Anita had way back at the nasty house but uh it's

15:58.740 --> 16:04.700
pretty good um I went back to New Orleans on a Tuesday hung out with my

16:04.700 --> 16:12.380
mommy I fussed at my mom it was fun and then Jamie Fuss had the most long

16:12.380 --> 16:17.980
boring flight back and like the last leg of my I hung out at the Dallas Airport

16:17.980 --> 16:24.700
for nearly two hours. Airports aren't so bad now though. They have Wi-Fi there. Yeah, they got Wi-Fi.

16:24.700 --> 16:29.420
I was just chillin' on my laptop. And not just that, but you know, just everything there is to do.

16:29.420 --> 16:32.980
They're practically shopping malls as well, though I would never buy anything there, but it's fun to

16:32.980 --> 16:38.840
look. You know, airports aren't that bad anymore. Well, some of them are. Yeah. But I was, I was having a

16:38.840 --> 16:43.420
pretty good time, I mean, and then I got on a plane. I read the entirety of Ramsey's the Damned

16:43.420 --> 16:48.460
on the plane. It's just I have to say safely the best Anne Rice book because all the rest

16:48.460 --> 16:55.460
of her stuff since is kind of crap. It's been gay porn. Yeah, but it's also crappy. Really

16:56.100 --> 17:03.100
crappy. Woman needs to get her groove back, not rest on her name. Although I did read

17:04.200 --> 17:11.020
the first novel of her Sleeping Beauty book. Very interesting, very interesting. Anyway,

17:11.020 --> 17:12.020
That was my trip.

17:12.020 --> 17:17.300
The rest of the time I finished homework, put up with stupid crap.

17:17.300 --> 17:19.780
You talking about that Bahmani party makes me nostalgic.

17:19.780 --> 17:23.940
Remember when we used to do that stuff at the old studio, which was a really great house

17:23.940 --> 17:24.940
for having parties?

17:24.940 --> 17:26.260
We'd have the Bahmani parties.

17:26.260 --> 17:27.500
We need to do that shit again.

17:27.500 --> 17:28.500
Yeah, we do.

17:28.500 --> 17:31.220
I mean, we actually, we kind of had a Bahmani party last night.

17:31.220 --> 17:34.640
I mean, it wasn't like a hardcore Bahmani party, but I'm sure we'll get to that as we

17:34.640 --> 17:36.020
go on through How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day.

17:36.020 --> 17:38.340
Do you remember the stuff I would bring with me?

17:38.340 --> 17:39.340
Oh yeah.

17:39.340 --> 17:46.020
I remember you brought your Dreamcast pads to one party.

17:46.020 --> 17:47.020
Yes I did.

17:47.020 --> 17:48.020
That was insane.

17:48.020 --> 17:54.940
I said, okay, this is what DDR was like in the old days before we had this vivid nonsense.

17:54.940 --> 18:01.060
I remember when one of our old guests used to be on the show that, Samya Magus, when

18:01.060 --> 18:05.660
he put on his girlfriend's top and was playing Para Para Para Dies and the picture made some

18:05.660 --> 18:07.580
rounds on the internet after that.

18:07.580 --> 18:13.620
And I remember Loki would haul his computer and his Delight Delight reduplication and

18:13.620 --> 18:16.420
his pads he'd made for it.

18:16.420 --> 18:17.420
I'm nostalgic.

18:17.420 --> 18:21.900
I would carry around the drum mania, keyboard mania, 2DX controller, the bunch of games.

18:21.900 --> 18:26.500
All of the old beat mania is my ass keypad.

18:26.500 --> 18:35.420
Do you think that when this DDR thing is dead, which could happen any day now, do you think

18:35.420 --> 18:39.020
the money parties are still going to be going on now we'll just go back to porn

18:39.020 --> 18:41.580
get this

18:41.580 --> 18:44.060
we'll just have to go back to the orgies you're right

18:44.060 --> 18:48.100
how silly of me to ask

18:48.100 --> 18:52.860
you know i have to get that copy of uh... of allie mcfeel again

18:52.860 --> 18:57.020
that was funny anyway anything else you want to share about your week and your day

18:57.020 --> 19:01.740
uh... no right along alright

19:01.740 --> 19:03.480
hey it

19:03.480 --> 19:05.480
Hey, it had a cameo by Ron Jeremy.

19:06.480 --> 19:08.480
Everything has a cameo by Ron Jeremy.

19:08.480 --> 19:13.480
Oh my god, I was looking up, um, there's a site online that's like these, uh,

19:13.480 --> 19:18.480
just paper dolls online and I was trying to make a new avatar for myself

19:18.480 --> 19:20.480
on, uh, my live journal.

19:20.480 --> 19:23.480
And I accidentally came across the real doll site.

19:24.480 --> 19:25.480
Oh god.

19:25.480 --> 19:27.480
It's very, very icky.

19:27.480 --> 19:30.480
I have a request for a new DDR Freak avatar

19:30.480 --> 19:32.480
because the gay pimp one you made me is really cool.

19:32.480 --> 19:38.480
I have a request for a new one. I want Xander from Drawn Together, just to make Seager jealous.

19:38.480 --> 19:39.480
From what?

19:39.480 --> 19:41.480
Drawn Together, that show on Comedy Central.

19:41.480 --> 19:42.480
From what?

19:42.480 --> 19:43.480
Oh girl, you are so far behind.

19:43.480 --> 19:47.480
I do not have anything but basic channels, but local channels.

19:47.480 --> 19:49.480
You're missing out, it's a funny show.

19:49.480 --> 19:52.480
And I think the TV is retarded.

19:52.480 --> 19:55.480
I don't even watch Survivor or The Apprentice or any of that reality bullshit anymore.

19:55.480 --> 19:57.480
Drawn Together is the only show I watch.

19:57.480 --> 19:59.480
Oh, and when did Hell Freeze over?

19:59.480 --> 20:01.480
I know, I know.

20:01.480 --> 20:06.480
You wanna talk about how I'm freezing over? I came this close to joining a gym on Friday.

20:06.480 --> 20:17.480
For the people who didn't have that visual, Rob held his fingers the length of...nevermind.

20:17.480 --> 20:19.480
He's not gonna talk about that.

20:19.480 --> 20:21.480
Shut up.

20:21.480 --> 20:24.480
No, because we don't bring up old drama.

20:24.480 --> 20:26.480
Yeah.

20:26.480 --> 20:28.480
What?

20:28.480 --> 20:35.480
Andrew says that when you said Xander, I started thinking of Buffy.

20:58.480 --> 21:01.920
anytime soon especially when we we just got like ultra mix 2 and the home

21:01.920 --> 21:05.480
versions are looking very promising for the future I don't think DDR seriously

21:05.480 --> 21:10.000
gonna die but I think it's um it's a little more cultish maybe I don't know

21:10.000 --> 21:15.360
we'll see I also have an announcement yes I no longer am on the Atkins crap

21:15.360 --> 21:20.560
well not crap it's good for a lot of people it was not good for me so I can

21:20.560 --> 21:28.880
have sushi again. Congratulations. Sushi is wonderful. And, and, and, and, and, and,

21:28.880 --> 21:36.000
and. Nothing else. Okay. Oh, Rob. Yes. Rob. Yes. Rob. What? Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob,

21:36.000 --> 21:44.520
Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob. Hi. I'm back! Damn. Angel, how was your week? How was your

21:44.520 --> 21:46.520
Give me a ferret to throw.

21:46.520 --> 21:49.520
Angel, how was your week? How was your day?

21:49.520 --> 21:53.520
School was school, and...

21:53.520 --> 21:57.520
Oh, nothing. Saturday was nice.

21:57.520 --> 22:02.520
I just wanted to waste the week away until Saturday came, because...

22:02.520 --> 22:05.520
Well, I had a birthday.

22:05.520 --> 22:08.520
Come on, everybody. Yay.

22:08.520 --> 22:10.520
Yay. Yay.

22:10.520 --> 22:12.520
Not.

22:12.520 --> 22:25.520
Actually hanging out with everyone was great, and we had played lots of Bumani, 8 style, and Poppin 10.

22:25.520 --> 22:28.520
So I got to see those for the first time, that was pretty cool.

22:28.520 --> 22:38.520
And the best thing of all was obviously hanging around with people they don't usually get to hang around with, so that was good.

22:38.520 --> 22:42.520
And just enjoying my birthday weekend so far, I guess.

22:46.560 --> 22:50.560
Now, Bradley, how was your week? How was your day?

22:50.600 --> 22:54.600
Alright, this week was work

22:54.640 --> 22:58.640
of course. And an interesting thing happened at work. There was

22:58.680 --> 23:02.680
a person, my kind of work is sort of a training

23:02.720 --> 23:06.720
people to do stuff. So when the students came back, he had to question before

23:06.720 --> 23:10.720
to do a test, a state test for his line of work he wanted to

23:10.740 --> 23:14.740
get into. And they come back and ask him questions and

23:14.760 --> 23:18.760
the instructor, he and the instructor had a nice

23:18.780 --> 23:22.780
somehow a disagreement or something about the instructor doesn't like this guy.

23:22.800 --> 23:26.800
So he actually misspoke and said that he didn't like him.

23:26.820 --> 23:30.820
So this caused him to get really angry and

23:30.840 --> 23:34.840
start ranting and raving and then he had to go outside, the manager had to take him

23:34.840 --> 23:37.720
outside and talk for like an hour, try to calm him down.

23:37.720 --> 23:43.920
They came back on Friday and his wife told him to bring along some candy just to give

23:43.920 --> 23:46.280
to us or something like that.

23:46.280 --> 23:50.120
And he comes back and, okay, he's like, hell, here's this candy.

23:50.120 --> 23:54.440
And then he comes, and then he starts watching this big thing about discrimination.

23:54.440 --> 23:55.720
He discriminates against me.

23:55.720 --> 24:00.280
He doesn't like me for some reason, some bullshit like that.

24:00.280 --> 24:04.280
And so, me and the perceptionists

24:04.300 --> 24:08.300
are in their room and he's like, I don't know, something kind of weird

24:08.320 --> 24:12.320
shit like that. So, good thing the boss came in

24:12.340 --> 24:16.340
like a minute later and then started to talk to him

24:16.360 --> 24:20.360
so we could sneak out. So, I went out in the hall for about

24:20.380 --> 24:24.380
an hour while they discussed something over and over again. Because this is the kind of guy

24:24.400 --> 24:28.400
who just like says the same thing like ten fucking times to try to make some sort

24:28.400 --> 24:33.640
point that no one gives a shit about, because he probably overreacts everything. And thankfully

24:33.640 --> 24:36.880
after that, about an hour, they moved into the office and talked another hour and a half

24:36.880 --> 24:37.880
or so.

24:37.880 --> 24:40.600
Were they getting paid for this? To talk?

24:40.600 --> 24:45.320
Well, it's a business, though. It's part of the work...

24:45.320 --> 24:49.480
I always found that humorous, when you know there's big fights going on and we have to

24:49.480 --> 24:52.840
sit down and have a discussion, but we're all getting paid for it, type thing. We just

24:52.840 --> 24:57.200
wasted three hours of productivity to talk out. Not that I ever get into disagreements

24:57.200 --> 24:58.500
of people but you know

24:58.500 --> 25:02.340
well i don't have anything to do it i just went out to the hall because i didn't want to get involved

25:02.340 --> 25:03.600
and you got paid for it too

25:03.600 --> 25:06.940
yeah so it was a nice one hour break

25:06.940 --> 25:08.860
not doing that

25:08.860 --> 25:11.140
just waiting until it cooled down

25:11.140 --> 25:14.700
uh... okay and on monday i got katamari damacy

25:14.700 --> 25:15.660
and that was a lot of fun

25:15.660 --> 25:18.440
na na na na na na na na na na na na

25:18.440 --> 25:19.580
sorry every time something

25:19.580 --> 25:20.340
it's like

25:20.340 --> 25:22.900
it's like how everybody says friends

25:22.900 --> 25:25.320
you think of nbc na na na na na na na na

25:25.320 --> 25:27.540
or when somebody says 90210

25:27.540 --> 25:30.520
duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh

25:30.520 --> 25:31.940
with katamari it's

25:31.940 --> 25:35.640
nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah

25:35.640 --> 25:38.080
shut up will you

25:38.080 --> 25:39.120
no actually I think of that

25:39.120 --> 25:41.640
I played that song too

25:41.640 --> 25:43.200
played that most every day this week

25:43.200 --> 25:45.120
actually I did play this every day this week

25:45.120 --> 25:47.360
except for today

25:47.360 --> 25:51.480
last night was the party for Angel and Anita

25:51.480 --> 25:53.280
or DeeDee Archipolic

25:53.280 --> 25:56.960
for their birthdays and that was a lot of fun because Navi brought over

25:56.960 --> 25:58.580
8th style and

25:58.580 --> 25:59.560
uh... popin' music

25:59.560 --> 26:02.760
god bless the town's popin' music horror

26:02.760 --> 26:06.600
we had to play on those arcade style controllers

26:06.600 --> 26:09.800
yeah and uh...

26:09.800 --> 26:12.040
and that was fun

26:12.040 --> 26:14.660
I didn't do all that great on 8th style

26:14.660 --> 26:17.560
because basically he had it up on a stand

26:17.560 --> 26:20.520
and the TV was down like two or three feet

26:20.520 --> 26:22.320
several feet away so

26:22.320 --> 26:25.440
I haven't played in an arcade style controller in a long time.

26:25.440 --> 26:27.320
And of course, there was the...

26:27.320 --> 26:30.560
I just played the hard news songs.

26:30.560 --> 26:35.840
What the hell is it called? Nebula Grasper? Nebula Grasper is a fuckin'...

26:35.840 --> 26:37.960
impossible.

26:37.960 --> 26:40.440
Well, at least for a first try, it's like, what the hell?

26:40.440 --> 26:41.720
All over the place.

26:41.720 --> 26:43.820
And I always love

26:43.820 --> 26:47.980
non-Bamani peoples, like the people who don't really play 2DX and DDR and stuff, I always

26:47.980 --> 26:51.520
love their reaction to stuff like that, because there were a few people at the party last night who

26:51.520 --> 26:55.600
who don't really play DDR2DX and they were just kind of watching Navi playing and just

26:55.600 --> 26:58.900
like he was just crazy. He was playing like Nebio Grasp or another or something and just

26:58.900 --> 27:08.900
everybody was just kind of like, that's crazy. That is so crazy. Man, that's crazy.

27:08.900 --> 27:13.040
Yeah, actually I played pop music for the first time ever because it's the first time

27:13.040 --> 27:17.740
I've actually been to anything where it's been brought out and actually passed like

27:17.740 --> 27:37.500
Mr. Loki, how was your week, how was your day?

27:37.500 --> 27:47.060
Today did not start out too good due to certain events that have taken place outside of our

27:47.060 --> 27:52.420
apartment complex in the street it was not fun we'll get into that later I'm

27:52.420 --> 28:02.300
sure and then yesterday it was okay went and down tonight's ferry to go ghost

28:02.300 --> 28:05.700
hunting supposedly and just walked around there for a little bit as fun

28:05.700 --> 28:12.180
hiking and stuff Friday wasn't that good either grandparents or grandma died so

28:12.180 --> 28:29.180
So, that sucked. Thursday, I can't remember Thursday. Thursday was okay, I guess. Most of the week I've been just playing Final Fantasy XI, leveling my summoner to 20, which I just finished right before the show.

28:29.180 --> 28:40.180
And, um, what else have I been doing? I've played a little bit of Grand Theft Auto, finally passed this mission, and I couldn't beat for a while, and now I have to run errands for some pimp.

28:40.180 --> 28:50.180
And, um, went and saw Closer. I'll get into that later. And, um, eh, that's about all.

28:50.180 --> 28:55.180
It's been, like, kind of a week just crashing into the ground.

28:55.180 --> 29:02.180
kostjamrh Have you used your machine to try and contact her yet?

29:25.180 --> 29:31.580
old mine town, it's got like a bunch of dilapidated, not really a mine town I guess, they have

29:31.580 --> 29:38.120
an old mill there that's kind of been, it's just the ruins of it. So we just walked around

29:38.120 --> 29:43.720
there and they also have a very long, they have a 150 meter covered bridge which is pretty

29:43.720 --> 29:49.400
neat and we walked down that and we went to their graveyard that was there and walked

29:49.400 --> 29:53.880
around that for a little bit. But you know, I mean, these are just for, it was just kind

29:53.880 --> 29:57.880
just to get out of the house, cause we, you know, we're looking for like an actual place that

29:57.880 --> 30:01.880
my, my example was something that's more

30:01.880 --> 30:05.880
trauma there than, you know, old, you know, cause not necessarily

30:05.880 --> 30:09.880
just visiting any old place is not gonna work, you need to have something where

30:09.880 --> 30:13.880
oh yeah, 50 people murdered there, you know, that kind of thing, um, just something

30:13.880 --> 30:17.880
you know, traumatic, like uh, insane asylum or something like that, but you know

30:17.880 --> 30:21.880
no luck with any of that stuff around here, so, oh well.

30:21.880 --> 30:26.880
kostjamrh Is it this place the Insane Asylum?

30:51.880 --> 31:00.880
The other things in the morning made me tired because I'm exhausted right now from having to wake up early yesterday and having to wake up early today.

31:00.880 --> 31:09.880
Alright, my turn. My week and my day. I got to play 8th style and pop music 10 twice this week, actually, because I hung out with Navi on Monday.

31:09.880 --> 31:13.880
I'll talk about those games a little bit later because I want to talk about my mommy stuff in a little bit.

31:13.880 --> 31:21.880
But, Navi and I, after playing some of that, we got to go to the mall and I was going to help him do some Christmas shopping over at Arden Fair, which is a big mall in Sacramento. It's a huge mall.

31:22.880 --> 31:27.880
And so, we ended up walking out of there. He didn't end up buying anything. He just kind of looked around us in different places.

31:27.880 --> 31:31.880
And I fucking bought an iPod at the Apple store.

31:31.880 --> 31:36.880
Because I wanted one, really. I wanted one really badly.

31:36.880 --> 31:38.880
I'm still too away for my free one.

31:38.880 --> 31:43.560
just buy a fucking iMac you know just join the cult I thought about it

31:43.560 --> 31:49.560
actually it's a big fling piece of shit that doesn't do anything you make Apple

31:49.560 --> 31:54.160
users cry unless you're in the graphics or media which you know this show

31:54.160 --> 31:57.960
happens to be one of the pros are on Macs maybe we wouldn't have the freaking

31:57.960 --> 32:06.240
buzz on a Mac anyway software either anyway besides the actual PC besides

32:06.240 --> 32:10.240
Oh yeah, I have to emulate a good CD.

32:10.240 --> 32:14.240
I just wanted an iPod, actually, because the stereo in my car broke a while back.

32:14.240 --> 32:18.240
Actually, it was Segerd's Echo Image CD that broke my CD player in the car, actually.

32:18.240 --> 32:22.240
Because it ate it and wouldn't give it back one day.

32:22.240 --> 32:26.240
Once it heard Echo Image, it could hear no other music.

32:26.240 --> 32:30.240
Basically, it's how it all boiled down.

32:30.240 --> 32:34.240
So, it won't eject CDs anymore, and now it won't even play the CD that's in there.

32:34.240 --> 32:38.040
luckily though it has an auxiliary port in it so I can plug anything I want in

32:38.040 --> 32:38.880
there so I'm just like

32:38.880 --> 32:42.560
fuck it I'm gonna get an iPod and I'll just use that as my car stereo so it's worked out

32:42.560 --> 32:45.920
really well except for the fact that if you think somebody if you think I'm bad

32:45.920 --> 32:49.500
when I'm talking on my cell phone and trying to drive you should see me when

32:49.500 --> 32:52.640
I'm trying to find the song on my iPod I wanna hear and drive at the same time

32:52.640 --> 32:57.240
it's beautiful and you know what they can

32:57.240 --> 33:01.160
pass all the laws they want that say I can't talk on my cell phone and drive but

33:01.160 --> 33:06.560
I don't see them making any law anytime soon that says I can't play on my iPod and try to drive at the same time so

33:06.560 --> 33:07.060
Look out!

33:07.060 --> 33:12.060
Actually I believe the law is operation of electronical devices while driving, so your iPod is included

33:12.060 --> 33:13.060
God dammit!

33:13.060 --> 33:17.560
Cause your car is technically an operational device that is electric

33:17.560 --> 33:22.060
Extraneous, like, CD-p...well, like, laptops

33:22.060 --> 33:24.060
Peripheral devices

33:26.060 --> 33:29.060
Seegerd in our chatroom right now over at OrangeLawnTrader.com

33:29.060 --> 33:35.340
He says that that day where my Echo Image CD got eaten by my car stereo player, he said

33:35.340 --> 33:38.980
that that day kind of pissed him off, except for the Classic Gaming Expo and the little

33:38.980 --> 33:42.260
girl that was hitting all the buttons on the restrooms that she rocked.

33:42.260 --> 33:46.460
And that reminds me, I actually found the picture of Jamie doing that at Classic Gaming

33:46.460 --> 33:47.460
Expo.

33:47.460 --> 33:49.700
I had my heads in the air.

33:49.700 --> 33:51.700
What was it, we paid you $10 to do it?

33:51.700 --> 33:52.700
Yeah.

33:52.700 --> 33:54.180
And I spent it on Pac-Land for the TurboGrafx.

33:54.180 --> 33:57.820
Yeah, we bought some game for you, basically, for you to imitate a little girl.

33:57.820 --> 33:59.820
I found the picture. I'm going to send it to Seagurd.

33:59.820 --> 34:04.820
By the way, we're going to the Classic Gaming Expo again this year.

34:04.820 --> 34:05.820
Even though...

34:05.820 --> 34:06.820
It's in bowling game.

34:06.820 --> 34:08.820
Even though last year was kind of...

34:08.820 --> 34:12.820
The only reason that last year's was end was because they had that thing a few days before.

34:12.820 --> 34:15.820
The Classic Gaming Expo this year is going to be in bowling game.

34:15.820 --> 34:18.820
That means trips to network video.

34:18.820 --> 34:21.820
And the store that sells the airsoft guns.

34:21.820 --> 34:36.820
Alright, and I guess that was pretty much my week of my day. I spent a lot of time playing Final Fantasy 11 as well, because basically I got stood up Friday night, so I decided to wither away my sorrows inside a nice game of Final Fantasy 11, so that was fun.

34:36.820 --> 34:45.820
I guess that's it. And then, well, of course, it was Angel's party, and, um, DDR Colic had a party on Saturday, and that was cool.

34:45.820 --> 34:53.820
Although, I just don't know, I got really tired by the end of it, and I don't know what it was. We were playing Cranium, but it wasn't just regular Cranium, but it was Turbo Cranium, okay?

34:53.820 --> 34:58.820
So, it's supposed to be, like, a faster version of Cranium, like one that you can play, like, in an hour.

34:58.820 --> 35:03.580
freaking game took us three hours to play the last time I played cranium it

35:03.580 --> 35:07.540
only took two turbo cranium ended up taking longer what in the hell is up with

35:07.540 --> 35:11.060
that and no it's not because we kept taking breaks it just was a long-ass

35:11.060 --> 35:15.660
game was no shorter nobody's gonna get this joke with you Rob but you can be my

35:15.660 --> 35:22.940
puppet master anytime how foul hey how long did the I had ended up having to

35:22.940 --> 35:26.420
leave around midnight because I was kind of afraid well a I was tired to be I was

35:26.420 --> 35:29.420
I was afraid I wasn't going to be able to park when I got back here if I waited any longer.

35:29.420 --> 35:31.420
But how was the rest of the night?

35:31.420 --> 35:37.420
Good, we ended up playing Hear Me Out for the majority of the night.

35:37.420 --> 35:39.420
I mean, we played Poppin' Ten also.

35:39.420 --> 35:43.420
But yeah, that other game was kind of weird.

35:43.420 --> 35:46.420
Also, a DD alcoholic made sushi from scratch.

35:46.420 --> 35:50.420
It was really good, but it was kind of interesting because she used wieners in it.

35:50.420 --> 35:52.420
She used hot dogs instead of fish.

35:52.420 --> 35:53.420
She put hot dogs in there.

35:53.420 --> 35:54.420
But it was actually really good.

35:54.420 --> 35:55.860
It was kind of weird.

35:55.860 --> 35:57.340
I just thought it was neat.

35:57.340 --> 35:58.340
It was very resourceful.

35:58.340 --> 35:59.860
It was a good idea.

35:59.860 --> 36:02.260
Anyway, we're going to take a break.

36:02.260 --> 36:03.700
When we come back from this break,

36:03.700 --> 36:05.940
we're going to talk a little bit more about 2DX8 style.

36:05.940 --> 36:08.060
We're going to talk a little more about Pop Music 10.

36:08.060 --> 36:11.560
I want to play the new remix of I Feel for you guys.

36:11.560 --> 36:13.360
We played it on Thursday night, but I

36:13.360 --> 36:15.660
know nobody listens to Outside the Box on Thursday night.

36:15.660 --> 36:17.160
But more of you guys listen tonight.

36:17.160 --> 36:21.820
So we're going to play the new I Feel mix from Service Pack.

36:21.820 --> 36:25.820
Song Pack 7 from UltraMix 2 because a lot of people don't want to hear that, so we're going to play that for you guys.

36:25.820 --> 36:27.820
And plenty more when we come back from this break.

36:27.820 --> 36:30.820
In this break though, some music from DDR Festival.

36:30.820 --> 36:34.820
Because we haven't really gotten to hear much music from DDR Festival yet, but we have some songs for you guys.

36:34.820 --> 36:39.820
We're going to hear Superstar, Diamonds, and Cutie Honey on this break.

36:39.820 --> 36:40.820
We'll be right back.

36:42.820 --> 36:44.820
Honestly, I didn't bother to buy Festival.

36:44.820 --> 36:48.820
I didn't think there was enough in it for me because I have Xtreme and I have an Xbox.

36:48.820 --> 36:54.820
So and I had ultra mix one which were a lot of songs came from but festival certainly has some quirky little songs in it

36:54.820 --> 36:55.940
Doesn't it?

36:55.940 --> 36:58.860
Interesting, so I have to say although I love superstar

36:58.860 --> 37:03.020
I it's almost worth buying the mix for that but not really because that's like 80 bucks

37:05.020 --> 37:08.220
Yeah, it does have different steps for a lot of the songs that were on ultra mix one

37:08.220 --> 37:10.500
But I don't know with with them

37:11.020 --> 37:14.460
Honestly with ultra mix to now and the fact that you can make your own edits

37:14.460 --> 37:18.620
I have a feeling that any day now we're gonna start seeing those steps to get uploaded to Xbox Live

37:18.620 --> 37:24.300
So I'm not really too concerned about it. It's just somebody has to take the effort and that person's not gonna be me cuz I'm lazy

37:26.020 --> 37:27.320
Anyway, uh

37:27.320 --> 37:30.740
2d x8 style got a chance to check it out over at

37:31.700 --> 37:36.820
Navi pop music or he has I got to check it out earlier this week and man do I suck at 2dx now

37:36.820 --> 37:42.420
I mean seriously, I haven't played 2dx. Seriously, you know quite a while. I didn't really get into 7th style

37:42.420 --> 37:43.860
I played at one time a

37:43.860 --> 37:54.860
A lot of this has to do with the fact that my controller is broken, and I'd rather buy myself a lot of other useless crap, like iPods and things like that, than buy a new 2DX controller.

37:54.860 --> 37:58.860
And I seriously think that's the reason that I haven't been playing a whole lot of 2DX.

37:58.860 --> 38:02.860
The 8 style is pretty sweet, I gotta say. It has a lot of great new songs in it.

38:02.860 --> 38:07.860
Those of you guys that listen to this show regularly, you already know how I feel about Everyday Lovely Day, like I love that song.

38:07.860 --> 38:10.860
And then of course it has a bunch of 2DX Red songs in it.

38:10.860 --> 38:14.860
Well, not a bunch, but three, which I consider to be a bunch for, you know, preview, because

38:14.860 --> 38:17.980
usually it's only like one or two.

38:17.980 --> 38:21.960
And then, some of the new consumer videos are pretty funny.

38:21.960 --> 38:25.300
Like Step Into the New World, I don't really like that song a whole lot, the song kind

38:25.300 --> 38:29.300
of, meh, but the video's pretty great, like with the anime and everything and the guy

38:29.300 --> 38:33.360
running down the street, and he uses his computer animation technique that's very interesting,

38:33.360 --> 38:38.340
like it turns these 2D settings into 3D, kind of like Parappa the Rappa, it looks like that,

38:38.340 --> 38:39.980
except not drawn.

38:39.980 --> 38:43.380
I guess that makes no sense whatsoever, I don't care.

38:43.380 --> 38:46.760
And then also another video I love is Love Box.

38:46.760 --> 38:50.600
I don't know if you guys got to see this video at all, but Love Box is the one that has,

38:50.600 --> 38:56.100
I think it's Meg, and one of her cohorts or something, I don't know, an uncredited person.

38:56.100 --> 39:00.300
They're dressed up as these like Austin Powers dance chicks, kind of.

39:00.300 --> 39:04.660
Like they're all dressed in these like 60s hippie, like things you'd see on Laugh-In.

39:04.660 --> 39:06.100
You remember that old show Laugh-In?

39:06.100 --> 39:07.840
Like when the people would be dancing?

39:07.840 --> 39:11.920
It was kind of like that, and they're just driving around the city and singing, and they're

39:11.920 --> 39:14.320
wearing glow bracelets and stuff.

39:14.320 --> 39:15.320
It's really great.

39:15.320 --> 39:16.320
Love, Fox.

39:16.320 --> 39:18.960
I highly recommend this one.

39:18.960 --> 39:24.640
Although the song kind of sucks, but the video is great.

39:24.640 --> 39:26.760
So you guys have gotten to play 8 style a little bit, too.

39:26.760 --> 39:30.120
What do you guys think of 2DX 8 style?

39:30.120 --> 39:32.760
I just suck at letting me go to the barrow.

39:32.760 --> 39:34.160
Oh, I remember that song was so great.

39:34.160 --> 39:36.760
And the scene kept falling out of my lap.

39:36.760 --> 39:40.680
I miss arcades.

39:40.680 --> 39:44.120
Were you playing on a regular, like, little controller?

39:44.120 --> 39:47.600
Yeah. See, Navi has one of those arcade-style controllers, so you don't have to put it in your lap.

39:47.600 --> 39:49.640
But they're kinda loud, like, they're really...

39:49.640 --> 39:53.020
those arcade-style ones are really loud. Like, you could hear that thing probably

39:53.020 --> 39:54.480
outside, like, a mile away.

39:54.480 --> 39:56.040
Clack, clack, clack. But...

39:56.040 --> 39:58.540
That's pretty neat. And sometimes it kinda overpowers the music.

39:58.540 --> 40:01.340
But it plays beautifully. It plays so beautifully.

40:01.340 --> 40:04.760
Arcadia, what do you think of 2DX8-style?

40:04.760 --> 40:06.320
pretty nice

40:06.320 --> 40:08.320
something you think you might have to break down and purchase

40:08.320 --> 40:09.240
I already have purchased it

40:09.240 --> 40:11.480
oh have you? I haven't gotten it yet

40:11.480 --> 40:13.640
you probably mentioned it, I forgot

40:13.640 --> 40:15.800
yeah, I mentioned it like two weeks ago

40:15.800 --> 40:18.480
that's right, I forgot

40:18.480 --> 40:19.880
uh... any

40:19.880 --> 40:24.640
particularly favorite consumer songs that you like, any of these songs?

40:24.640 --> 40:28.960
I haven't heard them enough to truly say yet

40:28.960 --> 40:33.300
I played a new seven star, I think it was uh... don't be afraid myself was one of

40:33.300 --> 40:36.300
like it's the J-pop one, it's got a really, it's actually got a pretty cool video to it.

40:36.300 --> 40:37.300
That song was great!

40:37.300 --> 40:38.300
It's got a pretty cool video to it.

40:38.300 --> 40:40.300
Didn't they have a video in the bathroom?

40:40.300 --> 40:41.300
In the shower?

40:41.300 --> 40:42.300
I think so.

40:42.300 --> 40:44.300
It looks like they were dancing in like a locker room shower.

40:44.300 --> 40:45.300
Yes, I think that might have been it.

40:45.300 --> 40:47.300
I could only kind of half-see the video because I was trying to play the song.

40:47.300 --> 40:48.300
That song was cool!

40:48.300 --> 40:51.300
Yeah, the song is cool, but man, I fucked up that song so bad.

40:51.300 --> 40:55.300
Like it really shows like how out of it on 2DX I am because I can't sight-read anymore.

40:55.300 --> 41:00.300
Like I was able to play Attitude and Star Dream and all these songs I used to play all the time on 8th style.

41:00.300 --> 41:01.300
I was able to play those just fine.

41:01.300 --> 41:05.380
was just fine. But man, throw something new at me, and I just, like, the rhythms and everything

41:05.380 --> 41:12.220
didn't make any sense to me. It was so sad. I cry for my 2DX skills. But Dancer, 8th style

41:12.220 --> 41:15.500
was worth it just to be able to play Dancer again. Although, is it just me or is something

41:15.500 --> 41:18.740
kind of weird at the end of the video? Like, it freezes kind of at the end of the video.

41:18.740 --> 41:22.580
He doesn't, like, I remember it kind of faded out in the arcade. Maybe I'm just crazy. I

41:22.580 --> 41:26.540
don't know. But a lot of 8th style machines had broken videos in the first place, so it's

41:26.540 --> 41:29.780
probably the first time a lot of people got to actually play 2DX with the videos. I don't

41:29.780 --> 41:32.780
Pretty cool. Angel, what were your thoughts on GXA style?

41:33.780 --> 41:37.780
Love Is Orange, Attitude, and A. That's all I have to say.

41:38.780 --> 41:45.780
I used to watch you guys play that all the time and I was always all envious. I still am, so yeah.

41:46.780 --> 41:51.780
A is technically a 7th style song, but it does make a repeat in 8th style.

41:51.780 --> 41:57.620
It's interesting, they took some of the most noteworthy 7th style songs, like A and Stoic,

41:57.620 --> 42:00.700
and they ended up repeating on 8th style after all. So now I'm kind of like, do I really

42:00.700 --> 42:06.060
need to get 7th style? But then I remembered, yes, I want to hoard Beauty of Silence in

42:06.060 --> 42:09.460
the privacy of my own home, is basically what it boils down to. Just like, remember the

42:09.460 --> 42:13.720
old arcade days? Frickin' everybody hoarded Beauty of Silence. Well, almost everybody.

42:13.720 --> 42:18.620
I know I was a big part of that, but. Like, Player's Best would be 511, because all the

42:48.620 --> 42:54.020
in 9 was way cooler where you could walk around and unlock things and play songs and stuff.

42:54.020 --> 42:57.940
I was a little disappointed by that. But the song list was pretty good in 10. There's a

42:57.940 --> 43:01.820
lot of great songs I love in 10. Of course, Goonies. We hoard that song like crazy here

43:01.820 --> 43:06.340
on Orange Lounge. Arrabatia, the Revenge song. Love that song. And I actually passed it on

43:06.340 --> 43:11.900
what's the second one up? Not EX. That's the third one up. Hyper? Is that the second level?

43:11.900 --> 43:16.820
It's like Basic and Hyper. See, I don't know my pop music. It's so sad. The middle one.

43:16.820 --> 43:21.820
Wherever it's ranked, like a 30 or something, 29, 30, I don't remember.

43:21.820 --> 43:34.820
Somebody needs to get me $1,000 for Christmas, so that way I can buy an ASC for 2DX, an ASC for pop music, and then import 8 style and as many pop music as I can before I'm bankrupt.

43:34.820 --> 43:41.820
So if you guys want to get me $1,000 for Christmas that would be great.

43:41.820 --> 43:45.820
Did you get to play Poppin' Ten at all at that party that you went to, Jamie?

43:46.820 --> 43:47.820
They're not Poppin' Ten.

43:47.820 --> 43:48.820
Oh, I thought maybe.

43:48.820 --> 43:50.820
I bought Poppin' Nine with me, but we ended up not playing it.

43:50.820 --> 43:55.820
Oh. Okay. Well, what did you think of Poppin' Music Ten, Angel?

43:55.820 --> 44:00.820
It was pretty, and watching Navi play is just insane.

44:00.820 --> 44:06.820
He plays faster than anyone else I've seen, you know.

44:06.820 --> 44:10.820
I just ended up watching it because I knew a lot of people wanted to play

44:10.820 --> 44:14.820
Pop N' Ten, so I just kind of left it at that.

44:14.820 --> 44:18.820
Plus we were busy with Cranium anyway, so, you know.

44:18.820 --> 44:22.820
Yeah, by the way, if anybody wants to call us

44:22.820 --> 44:26.820
we just opened up the Skype line if you want to figure out what that's all about.

44:26.820 --> 44:30.820
Head on over to www.orangelaunchradio.com and click on interact with us.

44:30.820 --> 44:34.820
And we want to take some phone calls asking you guys that have gotten a chance to play 8th Style or Pop Music 10

44:34.820 --> 44:38.740
10 what you guys think of it I have to say that the final verdict on 10 I kind

44:38.740 --> 44:42.900
of I mean obviously I need to play it more and obviously I still want it but I

44:42.900 --> 44:47.540
still think I kind of like 9 just a little bit better I just think 9 had

44:47.540 --> 44:51.500
some it was just set up a little better just kind of had some better songs but

44:51.500 --> 44:54.680
10 is really good don't get me wrong I would still buy 10 in a heartbeat but I

44:54.680 --> 45:01.700
just think I like 9 a little bit better but anyway Arkadian you got to play a

45:01.700 --> 45:05.380
little bit of pop in ten what'd you think real fast hi you're on orange

45:05.380 --> 45:11.220
on this radio hey there sky figure here hi sticky how you doing and I'm doing

45:11.220 --> 45:15.460
fine you know what I what I finally figured out what you were talking about

45:15.460 --> 45:18.260
last week with the 2d x8 style you remember how you said there was

45:18.260 --> 45:21.820
something in it that looked like extreme u.s. and a lot of people in the chat room

45:21.820 --> 45:25.700
well what the fuck is he talking about you remember that yeah I got what you

45:25.700 --> 45:29.700
meant now it was the menu in the beginning kind of had that like round

45:29.700 --> 45:37.460
wheel thing. Yeah, it's a menu. Gotcha. So, you got your copy of 8-Style, yes? Yep. And how have you been

45:37.460 --> 45:42.660
enjoying it? Yeah, I'm enjoying it. It's really good. I was one of the lucky ones who got the 2DX Red

45:42.660 --> 45:48.740
E-Amusement card, because after November 18th, they don't have it anymore. Really? Yeah. So, is there

45:48.740 --> 45:54.180
anything special about the card, or is it just the fact that, hey, I got a card? Actually, I wanted to

45:54.180 --> 45:59.540
used as a 2DX or an e-amusement card at AI because they have the e-amusement card readers.

45:59.540 --> 46:05.900
That's what I heard. Now, I'm actually going to be able to go to Arcade Infinity next week,

46:05.900 --> 46:06.900
I'm hoping.

46:06.900 --> 46:07.900
The e-amusement card over there.

46:07.900 --> 46:10.100
Well, it's out. I'm thinking about it.

46:10.100 --> 46:11.740
Yeah, that's cool.

46:11.740 --> 46:12.740
Yeah, think about it.

46:12.740 --> 46:18.740
Yeah, recently I double A'd a V35 on 7key.

46:18.740 --> 46:23.820
See, V35 is one of those songs I used to be really good at, but then I just suck it up

46:23.820 --> 46:26.260
Now what is that you're holding up there, a Namco?

46:26.260 --> 46:28.840
My Tekken 5 character data card.

46:28.840 --> 46:30.720
Get on topic!

46:30.720 --> 46:32.000
No, it's cool.

46:32.000 --> 46:34.060
Have you gotten to play pop music 10 at all?

46:34.060 --> 46:35.220
Uh, no.

46:35.220 --> 46:39.540
The last time I played a pop music was pop music 9 back in San Francisco.

46:39.540 --> 46:43.500
See, but isn't pop music 9 great?

46:43.500 --> 46:44.640
I think so anyway.

46:44.640 --> 46:50.240
Uh, so anything else you want to share about 2DX8 style, your experiences you're having with it?

46:50.240 --> 46:51.980
Well, um...

46:51.980 --> 47:04.980
There's a thing about getting the hidden songs, the 2D expert songs, you don't have to, about the easy thing, it turns out to be false.

47:04.980 --> 47:06.980
What do you mean?

47:06.980 --> 47:17.980
You can't play easy songs by unlocking a, by using an easy option.

47:17.980 --> 47:19.980
So you can't play an easy to unlock those songs?

47:19.980 --> 47:20.980
You can!

47:20.980 --> 47:22.080
oh you can

47:22.080 --> 47:25.140
yeah well shit that makes it easy doesn't it

47:25.140 --> 47:28.100
and what is the requirement again to start unlocking some of these 2d x red songs

47:28.100 --> 47:29.380
because I actually don't remember

47:29.380 --> 47:32.220
uh... play at least about a hundred songs

47:32.220 --> 47:37.620
to unlock spiral galaxy and taiyo

47:37.620 --> 47:38.860
wow a hundred songs

47:38.860 --> 47:43.260
well yeah just mostly light sevens or you know light seven to light

47:43.260 --> 47:44.820
to seven key songs

47:44.820 --> 47:48.260
i'm not afraid of playing seven key i've got to play some more to get better at it

47:48.260 --> 47:54.160
it, I think it's... Play more Light 7, just for the heck of it. I would play, now see

47:54.160 --> 47:59.500
Light 7 would be the kind of thing I would play to whore my VJ Army account up, if I

47:59.500 --> 48:04.100
had one. Hypothetically, if I had one. I'd be all, look at all these triple A's I got!

48:04.100 --> 48:09.300
Of course it was on Light 7, but man, I'm good. Cause I know, I know that there's people

48:09.300 --> 48:12.660
out there that do that. I mean, but that's okay, you know, Light 7's are songs too, you

48:12.660 --> 48:15.400
have every right

48:15.400 --> 48:17.840
and uh... there's another for random plus

48:17.840 --> 48:21.060
you have to play at least a hundred songs to unlock random plus

48:21.060 --> 48:23.940
and what exactly does random plus do again for those that

48:23.940 --> 48:29.500
uh... random plus is where the turntable is now included in the shuffle

48:29.500 --> 48:32.060
okay i gotcha oh that would be

48:32.060 --> 48:36.740
that would be so hard if you got some scales that oh god that's so crazy

48:36.740 --> 48:39.460
especially you know especially war game

48:39.460 --> 48:41.180
hahaha

48:41.180 --> 48:45.500
I hate that song. I can only imagine. War game on seven key was never a big

48:45.500 --> 48:46.900
problem for me. For some reasons,

48:46.900 --> 48:50.340
scratching, I'm like, I'm okay with it. I like that.

48:50.340 --> 48:54.180
Checking you out was the second seven star I ever beat and now I understand it's an

48:54.180 --> 48:54.900
eight star.

48:54.900 --> 48:59.500
So like, I beat an eight star like when I was beating my first seven star. That is so

48:59.500 --> 49:00.420
crazy to me.

49:00.420 --> 49:04.900
But for some reason, scratching has never bothered me. After you play a hundred songs with

49:04.900 --> 49:05.660
random,

49:05.660 --> 49:09.780
just hold the key too

49:09.780 --> 49:14.100
and then wait for the random to go red. And that's how it works?

49:14.100 --> 49:18.100
Yeah, that's how it works. So, those of you guys that are feeling a little crazy and want to play some

49:18.100 --> 49:19.340
random with the turntable,

49:19.340 --> 49:24.300
there you have it. Hmm, interesting. What would you say would be your favorite new

49:24.300 --> 49:28.900
video in 2DX8 style? I haven't seen all of them because I'm really busy playing

49:28.900 --> 49:34.340
70 songs. But I like Nebula Graspa a lot.

49:34.340 --> 49:37.860
Nebula Graspa's got a pretty good video to it. It's one of those futuristic,

49:37.860 --> 49:44.860
Typical kind of thing. It kind of reminded me of Hyperboundary 8 a little bit, because, you know, that was an LED song too, and it had all the futuristic graphics with it.

49:44.860 --> 49:46.860
Kind of reminded me of that a little bit.

49:46.860 --> 49:51.860
And I bought a 2DX Rare style. I really like Spiral Galaxy as well.

49:51.860 --> 49:54.860
Now, were you able to get the V-Rare when you got it?

49:54.860 --> 49:58.860
Oh, no, no, I didn't. Just the regular one I ordered.

49:58.860 --> 50:03.860
Oh, okay. All right. Well, anything else you want to share about the 2DX 8 style?

50:03.860 --> 50:05.860
Well, nothing much else.

50:05.860 --> 50:08.260
All right, well, we'll talk to you later then, I guess.

50:08.260 --> 50:09.660
Have a good one, Ziggy.

50:09.660 --> 50:10.260
All right, later.

50:10.260 --> 50:11.660
Later!

50:11.660 --> 50:12.760
I like getting phone calls.

50:12.760 --> 50:14.260
That was fun.

50:14.260 --> 50:16.460
All right, people say in our chat room right now,

50:16.460 --> 50:18.060
they're talking about 2DX too much.

50:18.060 --> 50:20.460
Well, it is the news that's going on right now, you know, you guys.

50:20.460 --> 50:22.060
But fine.

50:22.060 --> 50:23.660
We're going to talk about a little bit of DDR.

50:23.660 --> 50:27.660
We're going to try and get the, I feel, the new remix for you.

50:27.660 --> 50:31.460
Look, he's going to get that taken care of during the next break, right?

50:31.460 --> 50:32.060
Yeah.

50:32.060 --> 50:32.460
Good.

50:32.460 --> 50:34.660
Then I guess we're going to go to a break so we can get that song.

50:34.660 --> 50:37.820
We're gonna hear some music from DDR Festival, some more music, including-

50:37.820 --> 50:38.620
Yes, Jamie.

50:39.640 --> 50:40.140
What?

50:41.500 --> 50:45.240
Oh, we'll do the second mix break in a bit, but I wanna get the festival stuff taken care of first.

50:45.360 --> 50:50.320
Yes, I did threaten the chat room with some butterfly, and I know that's first mix, but I wanna get that in there too, at some point.

50:50.320 --> 50:51.820
Hahaha.

50:51.820 --> 50:52.760
So, we'll see what you can do.

50:52.760 --> 50:56.560
But, uh, in this break, a different version of Udonu....

50:57.080 --> 50:59.680
I can't even say this, you know the Captain Jack song from Fifth Mix?

50:59.680 --> 51:01.240
Udonu pum pum pum pum?

51:01.740 --> 51:03.640
Uh, uh, uh...

51:03.640 --> 51:08.040
Yeah, that song. There's like a new version of it in Festival, so we're gonna hear this.

51:08.040 --> 51:11.880
I haven't heard this one yet, so I gotta check this out. A remix of I Need You, which was

51:11.880 --> 51:19.000
a song that was kinda eh in the DDR Max 2 USA, but we'll hear it, see if it's any better.

51:19.000 --> 51:25.200
Here's the thing about I Need You, and it wasn't in, well, yeah, Max USA. This was the

51:25.200 --> 51:29.880
one that was on the V-Rare for the last mix. Alright, that wasn't too bad. Alright, so

51:29.880 --> 51:32.400
we'll check it out. We're gonna check out these songs and we'll be back, and we're gonna

51:32.400 --> 51:35.580
talk a little bit more about Ultramix 2, some of the news there, and play that new song

51:35.580 --> 51:36.580
from Ultramix 2.

51:36.580 --> 51:40.120
And of course the Cage match, FUs of the Week, all that good stuff coming up.

51:40.120 --> 51:44.920
And in the chatroom they're saying, look, since you're so white, Sky, just say, Dance

51:44.920 --> 51:45.920
Team, pom-pom-kolin.

51:45.920 --> 51:48.800
And even that I can't say right.

51:48.800 --> 51:50.880
I wasn't cut out for radio, what can I say?

51:50.880 --> 51:51.880
We'll be back.

51:51.880 --> 51:52.880
Crazy.

51:52.880 --> 51:58.000
Anyway, we are going to be playing the new I Feel remix.

51:58.000 --> 52:02.160
We ripped it during the break there, Loki, our tech masa is working on it right now trying

52:02.160 --> 52:06.360
to get it all perfect I said we should just rip it out of edit mode but

52:06.360 --> 52:10.080
apparently if you try to rip it in edit mode it cuts off the very beginning

52:10.080 --> 52:13.280
little speech thing because it starts up with do you feel it like it sounds like

52:13.280 --> 52:17.080
one of those like speaking spells or something saying it and that Loki was

52:17.080 --> 52:20.840
like no we can't have that so he made us go back and do it in edit mode so

52:20.840 --> 52:24.400
whatever that's fine at least we'll have it we can put it in rotation on our

52:24.400 --> 52:27.400
Bahmani musical more program which airs 24 hours a day seven days a week on this

52:27.400 --> 52:30.840
station when we're not here also speaking of live programming Monday

52:30.840 --> 52:36.120
night we have Diversion the Bamani remix show featuring professionally done remixes, amateur

52:36.120 --> 52:40.200
remixes and all that fun stuff. Monday night, 7 o'clock here on the station. A lot of really

52:40.200 --> 52:45.440
just original music I think. Just really great stuff if you haven't heard it yet. Tuesday

52:45.440 --> 52:50.080
night's on the station, Dark Sakura. She was off last week but she's back. At the pump

52:50.080 --> 52:55.280
of the volume where I just go crazy and play whatever. Although if you're in our chat room

52:55.280 --> 52:59.760
you can make a request and if I think that it doesn't totally suck ass I'll play it.

52:59.760 --> 53:01.220
amen to that

53:01.220 --> 53:03.600
and then uh... wednesday night

53:03.600 --> 53:07.620
as the oldie and moldy orange lawns radio show where basically we play a show from

53:07.620 --> 53:09.700
two years ago for your listening amusement

53:09.700 --> 53:13.080
listen to how much we used to suck if you think we suck now like we really

53:13.080 --> 53:14.820
sucked then

53:14.820 --> 53:18.980
and then um... thursday nights outside the box at seven o'clock

53:18.980 --> 53:22.680

53:22.680 --> 53:23.640
video gaming

53:23.640 --> 53:26.660
this last week was a pretty good show you missed a good time if you missed this week

53:26.660 --> 53:28.200
we had a we had a good time

53:28.200 --> 53:29.720
uh... and then friday night

53:29.720 --> 53:32.960
It's not on this station, but it's over on The Freak on DDR Freak Radio.

53:32.960 --> 53:36.800
The Rewinds, in case you missed a previous episode of Orange Lawn's radio,

53:36.800 --> 53:38.880
you can catch it over there, up to date.

53:38.880 --> 53:42.360
Actually, the show they're going to be playing this Friday is last week's show,

53:42.360 --> 53:44.560
which was the one where we had the Midi Head interview.

53:44.560 --> 53:47.080
If you guys missed the interview with Midi Head,

53:47.080 --> 53:49.800
awesome guy, awesome interview, you have to check it out.

53:49.800 --> 53:51.160
So go listen to Freak on Friday.

53:51.160 --> 53:55.920
Also, the karaoke cage match, by the way, was on last Friday.

53:55.920 --> 53:56.960
And of course, Loki won.

53:56.960 --> 53:58.960
Was there any surprise in anyone's mind?

53:58.960 --> 54:01.200
I don't think so.

54:01.200 --> 54:02.400
Moving right along.

54:02.400 --> 54:04.160
I've got to plug the LiveJournal community,

54:04.160 --> 54:05.920
because we haven't plugged that in a while.

54:05.920 --> 54:07.600
If you guys have a LiveJournal, which

54:07.600 --> 54:09.360
I know a lot of you do in this day and age,

54:09.360 --> 54:11.520
we're starting to move into a LiveJournal-y centered

54:11.520 --> 54:14.040
internet, head on over to our LiveJournal community.

54:14.040 --> 54:16.280
It's just username OrangeLounge on LiveJournal.

54:16.280 --> 54:18.780
And if you join it, you get some of the latest announcements

54:18.780 --> 54:20.120
on what's going on the station.

54:20.120 --> 54:22.760
Sometimes we propose ideas for changes

54:22.760 --> 54:24.280
to the station on our LiveJournal,

54:24.280 --> 54:25.600
and we get your feedback there.

54:25.600 --> 54:27.440
So it's a nice little community.

54:27.440 --> 54:30.720
It's a way for you to meet other listeners of Horns on the Radio.

54:30.720 --> 54:33.720
Crazy people like us.

54:33.720 --> 54:34.520
Let's see.

54:34.520 --> 54:35.800
DDR UltraMix 2.

54:35.800 --> 54:38.120
It's been a game we've been talking about a hell of a lot

54:38.120 --> 54:39.120
lately, I've got to say.

54:39.120 --> 54:44.160
But Song Pack 7 came out this week.

54:44.160 --> 54:46.160
Finally, a lot of us were expecting

54:46.160 --> 54:49.240
that Song Pack 7 was going to be out when the game came out.

54:49.240 --> 54:51.160
But for whatever reason, there was a delay.

54:51.160 --> 54:53.200
Sounds like there might have been some kind of bug

54:53.200 --> 54:54.160
that prevented things.

54:54.160 --> 54:55.040
I don't know.

54:55.040 --> 54:59.320
A lot of people bitching and moaning because Song Pack 7 has a lot of old songs in it.

54:59.320 --> 55:01.320
We were talking about this a little bit last week.

55:01.320 --> 55:06.120
But Song Pack 7 has End of the Century, and Las Deñarita, and Silent Hill.

55:06.120 --> 55:12.440
A lot of old, classic DDR songs, but I guess played out to a lot of people as well.

55:12.440 --> 55:13.440
An era as well.

55:13.440 --> 55:19.120
So you get some tack, finally, in DDR Ultimate 2.

55:19.120 --> 55:21.480
But a lot of these songs, since they're old, they're kind of played out.

55:21.480 --> 55:25.040
they're getting a lot of kind of negative feedback from folks out there

55:25.040 --> 55:28.320
even though I don't know I think it's kind of neat because a you get them 60

55:28.320 --> 55:32.920
frames a second B you can play them on Xbox Live now not that I'm a huge fan of

55:32.920 --> 55:38.600
any of the songs really I like era don't get me wrong I love era but then there's

55:38.600 --> 55:42.120
this new remix of I feel the junk circuit mix which is pretty interesting

55:42.120 --> 55:45.480
because junk circuit is another artist that's over on a different drum the

55:45.480 --> 55:49.920
background for this song has like the website address you may have noticed a

55:49.920 --> 55:53.280
a lot of the different drum songs a lot of those like the Jesper kid a lot of

55:53.280 --> 55:57.480
the lot of the new songs ultra mix to have websites in their backgrounds so

55:57.480 --> 55:59.400
it's kind of interesting that we're getting those in some of the song packs

55:59.400 --> 56:05.840
as well but I think in visiting junk circuits website I think there's

56:05.840 --> 56:09.880
actually a lot in common between junk circuit and Naropa who does the song

56:09.880 --> 56:14.960
standing still in time because they have the same website contact email so kind

56:14.960 --> 56:19.820
interesting all right anyway they're telling us in the chat room to stop

56:19.820 --> 56:23.020
talking about the song and play the damn thing already that's fine we'll get to

56:23.020 --> 56:26.960
it I'm going to copy it over right now mochi's put the finishing touches on it

56:26.960 --> 56:30.180
so we'll go ahead and play that for you but really first lucky what did you

56:30.180 --> 56:35.700
think of this remix you didn't like the other one why is that it was the other

56:35.700 --> 56:41.740
one just got stuck I don't know it was just kind of not much different I do

56:41.740 --> 56:45.620
like this one a little bit better too but I kind of like the old one as well I

56:45.620 --> 56:53.780
got to admit so I don't know what do I know all right hmm I got a copy it over

56:55.540 --> 56:59.980
I guess there was a big tournament on on ultimate to tonight online there's a lot

56:59.980 --> 57:03.780
of people talking about it over on TDR freak I missed it it wasn't something I

57:03.780 --> 57:06.820
knew I'd get my ass kicked so I didn't want to participate but I guess it went

57:06.820 --> 57:10.940
pretty well want to hear all right I'll stop talking and start playing here it

57:10.940 --> 57:16.940
It is Orange Launch Radio presents the brand new I Feel remix. It's the Junk Circuit mix. Enjoy, you guys.

57:16.940 --> 57:17.940
Do you feel it?

57:22.940 --> 57:23.940
Who did that again?

57:23.940 --> 57:24.940
Uh, that was Junk Circuit.

57:24.940 --> 57:27.940
Um, I like the original better.

57:27.940 --> 57:31.940
I think a lot of us can agree that the original is a little bit better. Nothing ever tops the original.

57:31.940 --> 57:33.940
It's like when you remake old movies.

57:33.940 --> 57:37.940
Oh, Loki says it does top the original. Well, I disagree!

57:37.940 --> 57:39.640
Nothing tops the Kiryamoga.

57:39.640 --> 57:40.640
What'd you think of that, Bradley?

57:40.640 --> 57:42.440
I liked it, except I think that the...

57:42.440 --> 57:43.940
I feel that the whole...

57:43.940 --> 57:47.140
Hold the bottom of the mic, it's breaking up a little bit, the cord's loose.

57:47.140 --> 57:49.740
That's alright, we're ghetto here, we don't have good equipment.

57:49.740 --> 57:51.640
Oh, now you're cutting out completely.

57:51.640 --> 57:52.040
Uh...

57:52.040 --> 57:52.540
There you are.

57:52.540 --> 57:52.940
Am I here?

57:52.940 --> 57:53.940
Yes, you're here.

57:53.940 --> 57:55.640
No, now you're gone again!

57:58.640 --> 57:59.940
No.

57:59.940 --> 58:02.340
Well, we need to buy a new mic, I think, something's going on.

58:02.340 --> 58:05.140
Steal this one real fast.

58:05.140 --> 58:07.140
D'oh. That one's dying.

58:08.140 --> 58:10.140
I'm gonna cry for that microphone.

58:11.140 --> 58:13.140
There we go, try that one.

58:13.140 --> 58:15.140
Yeah, that was pretty good.

58:15.140 --> 58:20.140
Except for I think that little computer I feel in voice is a bad touch.

58:20.140 --> 58:22.140
If they left it out it would make it better.

58:22.140 --> 58:24.140
Jazz in our chatroom agrees with you.

58:24.140 --> 58:28.140
He says the whole can you feel it samples just sounds fucking cheesy is what he says.

58:28.140 --> 58:29.140
Yeah.

58:29.140 --> 58:32.140
And Jamie's yelling from the laundry room that she agrees.

58:32.140 --> 58:34.140
Yeah. So overall I like it.

58:34.140 --> 58:42.140
Yeah, I think it's pretty good. I think the Can You Feel It is a little weird, but I don't know. It's different.

58:42.140 --> 58:48.140
I'd give them points for trying. It's a good remix. It's a fun song to play.

58:48.140 --> 58:49.140
The steps are kind of interesting.

58:49.140 --> 58:52.140
It took something good and added a bunch of extraneous crap to it.

58:52.140 --> 58:57.140
The steps... Is there any DDR remix that you've liked so far?

58:57.140 --> 59:01.140
I like the Let This Face one that you interviewed last week.

59:01.140 --> 59:02.140
Midi Head?

59:02.140 --> 59:15.540
okay all right yeah what's his face I know you'll get you'll get to talk to

59:15.540 --> 59:18.140
the next CD alright we're hoping we have many head back at some point actually

59:18.140 --> 59:22.900
but actually if you guys missed it I know that right now he's gonna he agreed

59:22.900 --> 59:29.260
to do an interview with DDR freak so if you go on to the game console games what

59:29.260 --> 59:33.100
is that VDR console games forum there's a little sticky announcement thingy where

59:33.100 --> 59:36.540
you can ask me to hit a question so if you missed getting your question last

59:36.540 --> 59:38.900
week because we took some questions from our listeners but if you missed your

59:38.900 --> 59:42.740
chance to ask me to hit a question they are taking question submissions right

59:42.740 --> 59:46.680
now so go check that out if you like what you think of that remix angel you

59:46.680 --> 59:49.860
like everything so I know you're gonna have something good to say about it

59:49.860 --> 59:56.500
well I like the first one from Silent Hill when we first did that one

59:56.500 --> 01:00:00.500
That one when the other one came out, I liked that one, so what do you think my answer is going to be this time?

01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:03.500
Come on. What do you think?

01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:04.500
Ten?

01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:05.500
Yeah.

01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:08.500
You're such a Bobani whore. I love it.

01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:12.500
What?

01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:15.500
You said you called her a whore.

01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:18.500
You make it sound like it's the first time. Come on.

01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:22.880
All right, I want to take some calls on the Skype line.

01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:26.820
If you want to give us a call, head on over to www.orangelandreo.com

01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:28.300
and click on Interact With Us.

01:00:28.300 --> 01:00:31.140
I'm kind of curious about some of your guys' feedback on Ultra Mix 2,

01:00:31.140 --> 01:00:34.220
specifically Song Pack 7, if you've had a chance to check it out.

01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:36.940
Any online experiences you might have had on Ultra Mix 2,

01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:39.140
and even if you want to talk about a DDR festival,

01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:41.520
because we haven't talked a whole lot about DDR festival,

01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:43.940
and that's just because none of us in, I don't think,

01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:47.060
a single person in Sacramento, that I know of anyway, has bought the game.

01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:49.060
We don't know what to say about it.

01:00:49.060 --> 01:00:53.060
And to add to that, if you'd like to talk about drawn together as well.

01:00:53.060 --> 01:00:55.060
No, that's not...

01:00:59.060 --> 01:01:00.060
What?

01:01:01.060 --> 01:01:03.060
I have a thing, no I don't.

01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:05.060
Shut up.

01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:08.060
Did you ever get a chance to play Ultra Mix 2, Jamie?

01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:10.060
Did you guys pick that up at your place yet?

01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:11.060
No.

01:01:11.060 --> 01:01:12.060
Are you gonna get it?

01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:14.060
It's fun.

01:01:14.060 --> 01:01:15.060
Dot, dot, dot.

01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:16.060
It's fun!

01:01:16.060 --> 01:01:17.060
Maybe.

01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:18.060
You should.

01:01:18.060 --> 01:01:21.500
The house is going to be arranged in Halo 2 land position.

01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:26.040
I have no room to put any dance pads or anything.

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:27.040
Look at this place!

01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:28.040
Hello!

01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:29.040
You can see the hard dance.

01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:30.040
You have infinitely more room.

01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:35.280
Dance class normally in my living room we have the TV on one wall, the couch on one

01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:39.060
wall and the loveseat back on the far wall.

01:01:39.060 --> 01:01:44.620
Well now the loveseat and couch are back to back with just enough room to have a place

01:01:44.620 --> 01:01:51.620
to put your legs in an Xbox between TVs. It is currently in land mode.

01:02:14.620 --> 01:02:17.620
Except now they're talking about drawing together in our chat room.

01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:20.620
You freaking ass, Loki.

01:02:20.620 --> 01:02:21.620
Jerk.

01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:25.620
Loki, now you keep telling me that you're going to start playing UltraMix 2,

01:02:25.620 --> 01:02:28.620
because I notice that every time I've been playing it, you're like,

01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:29.620
Yeah, I need to play that.

01:02:29.620 --> 01:02:31.620
Yeah, I need to play that.

01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:34.620
Are you actually going to be playing? Oh, we're finally getting a call.

01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:38.620
You're on, you get a reprieve for now, but as soon as this call's done,

01:02:38.620 --> 01:02:39.620
we're going to ask you about that.

01:02:39.620 --> 01:02:42.620
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:02:42.620 --> 01:02:48.180
Legend Zaku here. Hi Zaku, how are you? I don't have that much to share because

01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:52.060
you know, as I said, you know, I'm a college student. Then get off the phone!

01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:57.020
I don't have a PS2 or an Xbox. I might get one this Christmas but I'm kinda iffy on

01:02:57.020 --> 01:02:57.620
which one

01:02:57.620 --> 01:03:02.260
should I get, you know, Bomani-wise that is. So you don't have a PS2 or an Xbox, so you're

01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:03.160
asking the

01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:07.020
age-old question, which system should I get? No, but in

01:03:07.020 --> 01:03:10.380
with regards to not only, you know, games but also Bomani as well.

01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:37.660
If you're interested in something that's going to remind you of the arcade, something that's

01:03:37.660 --> 01:03:41.020
gonna bring you the arcade experience to the home something where there's a lot

01:03:41.020 --> 01:03:44.780
of different songs available something with itoy support if you want to get

01:03:44.780 --> 01:03:49.340
your hands involved go for the ps2 if you want to get something where you can

01:03:49.340 --> 01:03:53.600
play online and you want to play against other people that live around go for the

01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:56.940
Xbox but here's the thing you being the starving college student that means

01:03:56.940 --> 01:03:59.660
you're gonna have to pay for the Xbox Xbox Live and then five bucks a song

01:03:59.660 --> 01:04:05.700
pack so I don't know what what are you yeah but also with the ps2 I might have

01:04:05.700 --> 01:04:09.700
I have to mod it. I have to mod it if I'm going to play 2DX or any of those lovely but

01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:11.220
modded games besides CD-R.

01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:14.940
Well, that's very true, and that's going to cost you money as well, I mean, if you want

01:04:14.940 --> 01:04:19.380
to play the Japanese game. And that's the other thing, if you plan on modding your PS2,

01:04:19.380 --> 01:04:23.900
which, you know, can have mixed results, I guess I hear now it's pretty easy to mod it.

01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:28.260
I live in the city. I live in the city. Chinatown's not that far, and I can always get it modded.

01:04:28.260 --> 01:04:31.440
Alright, alright. Fair enough. So you can get a modded PS2. So if you're interested

01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:34.940
in 2DX or Poppin' or any of that stuff, you're definitely going to want to get the PS2.

01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:39.140
Here's the other thing to consider, too.

01:04:39.140 --> 01:04:44.020
We have PS3 and Xbox2 likely to be out in stores before next Christmas.

01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:47.940
We don't know for sure, but if I were a betting man, I would say those things are going to

01:04:47.940 --> 01:04:52.460
be in stores next Christmas, which means the systems that are out there now, their prices

01:04:52.460 --> 01:04:53.460
will be halved.

01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:55.620
Or they'll be $100 or less.

01:04:55.620 --> 01:05:02.060
Yeah, I probably already took notice of that, and I think 9th Style, if it does come out

01:05:02.060 --> 01:05:06.500
next year for PS2. I don't know if it's going to jump into the next console or just be the

01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:08.820
last PS2 2DX game.

01:05:08.820 --> 01:05:13.460
I'm kind of hoping that there is a ninth style and a tenth style pretty back to back. I'm

01:05:13.460 --> 01:05:15.660
kind of hoping that those games come out pretty quickly.

01:05:15.660 --> 01:05:19.780
For PS2 or just one for PS2 and the next for PS3?

01:05:19.780 --> 01:05:26.940
I hope they both come out. I think it's a given that PS3 will play PS2 games, so they

01:05:26.940 --> 01:05:28.940
ought to just both come out for PS2.

01:05:28.940 --> 01:05:37.940
Yeah, seeing as, you know, I already noticed that 2DX games come out, you know, there's always 2DX games coming out for PS2 every single year.

01:05:37.940 --> 01:05:45.940
And basically, from what I'm speculating, from what I'm predicting, 9th Style might come out in May next year or something, or near the summer.

01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:47.940
Who knows? Nobody really knows.

01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:48.940
I'm taking a guess here.

01:05:48.940 --> 01:05:49.940
Yeah, you're taking a shot.

01:05:49.940 --> 01:05:51.940
I'm taking an educated guess from...

01:05:51.940 --> 01:05:55.940
But, you know, alright, I think pretty much I...

01:05:55.940 --> 01:06:00.660
Then again, 9th style would make a lot of sense on Playstation 3 because then they could

01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:02.980
fuck up the timing.

01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:06.900
By putting it on a new system, just like the arcade ones.

01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:11.420
And if I get a PS2 for Bomani, I'm going to have to pay money for the 2DX controller,

01:06:11.420 --> 01:06:16.620
Pop'n Music, so it's going to be equally the same if I'm going to try going after both.

01:06:16.620 --> 01:06:22.780
Because one will have more peripherals and the other will have more services and things

01:06:22.780 --> 01:06:23.780
to buy.

01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:27.980
Now, also, to even confuse things even more, there's also the Phantom console that's coming

01:06:27.980 --> 01:06:35.180
out and, um, the, how is that confusing? Who gives a shit about the Phantom? Seriously?

01:06:35.180 --> 01:06:42.260
What the, what's that? Exactly, exactly. Hey, I've got pictures of the girl on orangeandreideo.com.

01:06:42.260 --> 01:06:48.920
And I hear rumors, I hear rumors of the, um, N-Gage 2 that's shaped like a banana. I have

01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:55.920
I've heard rumors of a foul movement I'm about to have after this show.

01:06:55.920 --> 01:07:02.920
Here's the thing though, if you're looking for a system for Bamani, don't get a GameCube.

01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:06.920
Of course not, hell no, GameCube is not worth the money.

01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:10.920
Hey, don't you be knocking the GameCube, it's a beautiful system, it's not if you're into Bamani.

01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:12.920
I mean, it's cheap, but I mean...

01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:15.920
Don't make me come out there and cut you, because I will.

01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:17.920
What, you're going to travel 3,000 miles?

01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:19.920
to cut you? To cut you, yes.

01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:22.920
Do you even know where in New York do I live?

01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:24.920
I'll send my minions.

01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:26.920
Yeah, sure.

01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:28.920
Do you want a cookie for that, Sky?

01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:30.920
We can track your IP!

01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:32.920
That's right.

01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:35.920
Live 365 has it all on record, I think.

01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:39.920
Sure it does. What IP and what school am I going to?

01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:43.920
You're going to the school of Hangup in about five seconds there, buddy.

01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:45.920
Thanks a lot, Sky.

01:07:45.920 --> 01:08:02.320
you're welcome. Take care of Zaku. Zaku is always fun to talk to. I like bullying him

01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:06.800
a little bit. He's fun. He's a fun guy. Alright. We're going to go do the Orange Lawns Radio

01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:16.200
cage match we got to get into that all right moving right along I've been

01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:20.600
perusing some of the message forms out there lately DDR freak namely being one

01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:24.380
of them I thought there was this very interesting thread over there in random

01:08:24.380 --> 01:08:27.500
chat you know how they do a lot of like really crazy stuff over in random chat

01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:31.820
you know the random chat stuff right right dark Sakura being a mod over there

01:08:31.820 --> 01:08:38.000
and everything yeah what's this random that you talk about yeah we don't know

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:41.360
anything we don't know anything about random on this show what would you um

01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:44.420
just had a curiosity this is total tangent but since you know I'm thinking

01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:48.300
dark Sakura here and how much he loves to lock topics over there what would you

01:08:48.300 --> 01:08:55.600
say would be the most favorite topic you've gotten to lock on random chat hi

01:08:55.600 --> 01:09:06.120
please lock this yes I've had a please lock this before hi please lock this

01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:10.840
alright there's an interesting topic going on there in random chats called do

01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:14.880
you actually play DDR anymore and I thought it was kind of interesting just

01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:20.080
seeing how many people actually don't play DDR anymore so I kind of was gonna

01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:27.080
to go around the room a little bit and see, do you play DDR anymore? And if not, why are

01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:32.680
you doing this show? Because I have a create, I'll start. Do I play DDR anymore? A little

01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:37.200
bit, not as much nearly as I used to. I play a little bit of UltraMix II at home. Most

01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:41.640
of my DDR playing is controller controller. The reason why I don't play DDR that much

01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:45.840
anymore is because the quality of arcades in this area went downhill significantly.

01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:49.840
Konami of Japan can suck it for not putting out a new mix in a long time. I think that

01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:54.440
It has a lot to do with the reason why I haven't played DDR in a long time.

01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:58.540
The home version is the only thing keeping it alive to me, but I just can't motivate

01:09:58.540 --> 01:10:03.640
my fat ass to pull out the ignition pad, especially when the ignition pad, as good of a dance

01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:05.920
pad as it is, it's still not the arcade.

01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:10.560
I want to play DDR in the arcade, and there's no good arcade mix.

01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:17.720
And yes, I realize there was that StepMania thing, but to me, it's still only 90%, and

01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:19.380
the damn thing broke in a week anyway.

01:10:19.380 --> 01:10:26.100
it's still not everything that DDR is, it's still got issues. In The Groove, it's okay,

01:10:26.100 --> 01:10:35.900
but yeah, Ego killed the video game star I guess. Dark Sakura, do you play DDR anymore?

01:10:35.900 --> 01:10:41.700
I played DDR when I was in Alabama. Well there you go. Do you play it regularly besides that?

01:10:41.700 --> 01:10:46.340
When I'm somewhere that has a machine I'll play. I've got more reason to play now than

01:10:46.340 --> 01:10:55.940
I played one game of DDR when I went to go play Doc at Derby Owners Club over at Rosewood

01:10:55.940 --> 01:11:00.140
Golf Land, but here's the problem, I fucking failed Breakdown. Now, you know, it's a 9-footer,

01:11:00.140 --> 01:11:03.420
it's a more difficult song at the end of the scale, but you have to remember, I'm somebody

01:11:03.420 --> 01:11:10.620
who was playing DDR religiously for quite some time, and, you know, I, it just makes

01:11:10.620 --> 01:11:16.140
me sad how much stamina I've lost, you know? Alright. Arcadian, do you actually play DDR

01:11:16.140 --> 01:11:22.100
anymore? Not really just mainly because my foot's been hurting and and I've had

01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:26.500
that and because I haven't had that much money lately no I know I might be able

01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:32.940
to go once my foot feels 100% or 90% at least maybe in more in the

01:11:32.940 --> 01:11:36.860
future because I've spent so long and I need to get off my fat ass when I sit

01:11:36.860 --> 01:11:42.860
LOKI, do you play DDR anymore?

01:11:42.860 --> 01:11:46.860
Is DDR in Final Fantasy XI?

01:11:46.860 --> 01:11:49.860
A DICKED!

01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:53.860
Yes I do, I'm StepMania, every once in a while I'll play it.

01:11:53.860 --> 01:12:01.860
But, yes, to answer your question earlier about Xbox and stuff and if I was ever going to play it,

01:12:01.860 --> 01:12:05.520
because I'm going to actually set up my step mania cabinet to be playing some stuff. In

01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:10.080
fact, that's why I bought crap today to cut the other control panel for the actual, you

01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:15.200
know, select arrows and stuff. That's why I was going to do that today. I'm hopefully

01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:20.480
going to build that this week because I had bought a while back a new IPAC thing to hook

01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:25.400
it all up and I have to see if it's going to get fried as easy as the other one. So,

01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:30.040
it's all contingent on that, whether I get to play some more. I don't play in the arcade

01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:39.040
because the arcade's too far away, takes too much of my time, cuts into my Final Fantasy XI time, and the arcade's broken all the time.

01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:45.040
I'm not in a way fucking out of shape. I go and play like a seven-footer on doubles and I'm ready to die.

01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:50.040
I mean, whatever happened to me? That's what I want to know. It never used to be this hard.

01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:57.040
But once I get back in shape, yeah, I play a lot more. I just need to finish my arcade cabinets before I move out of here.

01:12:57.040 --> 01:13:00.000
So that's priority one.

01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:07.000
You don't play a whole lot of DDR in the arcade or at home anymore,

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:11.040
yet you're very gung ho about this cabinet and everything.

01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:11.960
Why do you think that is?

01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:17.080
Is it just a love for the basic concept of the game or like building stuff?

01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:22.240
Have you noticed stuff that doesn't work like the portal to hell?

01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:26.760
Also, I notice you intend to build things halfway through

01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:30.400
and don't finish them. Such as these lovely metal pads that have been sitting over here

01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:37.800
for the past... Can we play Xbox or PS2 games with them right now? We can if I hooked up

01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:42.480
the other, the IPAC thing because all I have to do is switch out the old IPAC and it plugs

01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:48.000
right in and it works. But the thing is, the thing is I haven't bought the adapter for

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:55.320
the Xbox or the PS2 yet because it was hooking up directly to my computer. But yes I could.

01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:56.540
I could if I wanted to.

01:13:56.540 --> 01:13:58.080
It just would take a while because I'd

01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:00.400
have to wire everything.

01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:02.720
But it's just that those things that I would be curious

01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:05.400
how thick the layer of dust is on those metal pads that

01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:07.280
are sitting right there.

01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:09.520
Can I go wipe my finger on it and see

01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:12.240
how much dust is on them?

01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:15.400
Here you go, Loki.

01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:17.960
They're also by the air intake, just so you know.

01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:30.240
I have an idea, let me wipe the dust off of my computer desk here, because I get quite

01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:31.240
a bit used to that.

01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:32.240
I don't think it's great.

01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:35.760
Let me wipe the dust off of every, there's dust everywhere in here!

01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:39.660
It's not a surprise that there's dust on those.

01:14:39.660 --> 01:14:44.080
That and they're right next to the air intake, which I'm sure is not good for the air conditioner

01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:47.200
one bit, but that's alright.

01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:51.120
No wonder it smells like wood in this house all the time, this strange mix of metal and

01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:52.120
everything.

01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:54.120
Alright, explicit.

01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:55.120
Welcome to the show, by the way.

01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:56.280
I noticed you just ran in there.

01:14:56.280 --> 01:14:57.600
Put down the DS for a minute.

01:14:57.600 --> 01:14:59.880
Quit chatting with Angel on PicoChat for a minute.

01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:00.880
That mic's been giving us...

01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:01.880
Yeah.

01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:02.880
They are like...

01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:03.880
What?

01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:04.880
Eight feet?

01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:05.880
What the hell?

01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:06.880
This is what...

01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:07.880
I think we're exchanging special pictures.

01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:08.880
This is the wrong people.

01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:09.880
You need to talk.

01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:10.880
Talky talky.

01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:12.880
You need to talk.

01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:17.880
Just like the people IMing each other when they're sitting in a cafe.

01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:18.880
Talk!

01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:22.880
They're riding a penis back and forth to each other.

01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:24.880
No Rob, that's you last night.

01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:25.880
Thank you!

01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:26.880
Thank you.

01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:29.880
You gotta hold the mic at the bottom because it's going out tonight.

01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:30.880
Put that mic on its last legs.

01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:31.880
Can you hear me now?

01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:32.880
Yes I can hear you now.

01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:33.880
Do you play DDR?

01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:41.880
Well, since there's been tournaments and stuff, and the few new people want me to come back again, I guess I'll play again.

01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:49.880
Well, even though the DDR scene is dying in a way, because there hasn't been any releases for the arcade and stuff, it's totally understandable.

01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:56.880
But, it's just the new people, the community, the new members are just trying to bring it back again in a way.

01:15:56.880 --> 01:16:00.880
You give me $100,000, I'll bring back DDR. It's all again.

01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:04.880
The only way that you can bring back DDR is by fixing the same mini-cabinet, dammit.

01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:05.880
Fuck that, Kevin.

01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:07.680
Just give me $100,000.

01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:11.180
Hell, give me just $20,000 and I'll bring it back.

01:16:11.180 --> 01:16:15.280
Don't you think that, now, call me crazy because it's not supposed to be DDR, quote unquote,

01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:18.080
don't you think In the Groove was sort of a way to try to bring DDR back?

01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:20.280
That's why I always got the impression I was in the groove with...

01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:23.780
Even though it's not DDR!

01:16:23.780 --> 01:16:29.380
Well, the thing about In the Groove is that not many cabinets have been sold around the US just yet.

01:16:29.380 --> 01:16:34.380
And very few songs are in it, mainly just a test in the waters, and so in the Groove 2 comes out and stuff.

01:16:35.380 --> 01:16:40.380
And it also depends on what step makers are they going to hire and what songs they're going to put in it.

01:16:43.380 --> 01:16:47.380
Hell, if they put UltraMix, like UltraMix in the CD-R cabinet, I'd play it.

01:16:48.380 --> 01:16:55.380
I already, the first week after UltraMix 2 is out, I put the call out on this show, I said we need to hound the shit out of Konami of Hawaii and however it has to happen.

01:16:55.380 --> 01:17:00.640
it has to happen. I don't care if some arcade division went under or what the shit happened.

01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:04.100
I don't care how it has to happen. It just needs to happen. Hawaii needs to make a new

01:17:04.100 --> 01:17:08.420
arcade mix. End of story. I don't care who's got to be blown, who's got to be paid the

01:17:08.420 --> 01:17:13.940
money. Make it happen. You know what's hella funny though? The hella companies are saying

01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:18.300
that the whole arcade business is dying unless you're trying to do like this car system like

01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:25.300
Tekken 5 and Midnight Tuner or Initial D. Yeah, but the lines for Tekken 5? Insane.

01:17:25.300 --> 01:17:33.300
Honestly, you can't say Tekken 5 is not, I mean, despite how you feel about the Tekken series, it's, you know, the biggest crowd I've seen in an arcade in a long time.

01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:34.300
I have no clue.

01:17:34.300 --> 01:17:35.300
That's true.

01:17:35.300 --> 01:17:45.300
You know, that's just like people saying, oh, well, you know, internet's killing the telephone. People still use the telephone just like people use the internet.

01:17:45.300 --> 01:17:49.300
Yes, people still use the telephone and I talk to them. Sorry.

01:17:49.300 --> 01:17:55.300
But the whole thing is is the convert, you know, ultra mix to an arcade system is like fucking easy

01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:57.980
minimal programming licensing of songs

01:17:58.780 --> 01:18:02.000
Build the hardware hardware is fucking easy to build. I mean, come on

01:18:02.140 --> 01:18:07.700
That's just it's just an excuse but I just don't want to do it because they don't want to distribute it and that's a bit

01:18:07.700 --> 01:18:12.360
The reason why I pump it up is like making more and more money just building new machines and stuff

01:18:12.360 --> 01:18:21.080
So, allow me to be the first to offer sex to anyone at Konami of Hawaii if you can make

01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:22.840
yourselves a new DDR game.

01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:27.840
You know what, not the Konami of Japan does a bad job, so if they want to do a new mix,

01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:29.860
I'm perfectly fine with that as well.

01:18:29.860 --> 01:18:35.660
I will extend my sex offer to Konami of Tokyo as well, K-set.

01:18:35.660 --> 01:18:39.740
So just make me a new DDR and I will put out, it's that simple.

01:18:39.740 --> 01:18:48.260
else care to offer their sexual favors? You know, this is what the Sesame Office, they're

01:18:48.260 --> 01:18:53.540
like, oh, this is too expensive to license songs here in America, I'm glad we can't do

01:18:53.540 --> 01:18:58.940
it. Do all in-house music, you have like, what, like five different series of culprits?

01:18:58.940 --> 01:19:02.780
Do what you've been doing for years, license the song in Japan and then let the machines

01:19:02.780 --> 01:19:07.740
come over here. That's what they've been doing for years. Because it's cheaper to license

01:19:07.740 --> 01:19:24.020
the songs in Japan, obviously, it's not meant to be played in the United States. They could

01:19:24.020 --> 01:19:30.340
call it DDR shit mix and I'd still play it. I'm sorry, shitake. They could call it DDR

01:19:30.340 --> 01:19:36.100
Takei Mix, I would still play it.

01:19:36.100 --> 01:19:39.180
Angel, uh, you still play DDR at all?

01:19:39.180 --> 01:19:42.700
You're probably more into DDR than anyone I know right now, so I have to ask you this.

01:19:42.700 --> 01:19:45.940
Oh yeah, in fact I'm probably gonna

01:19:45.940 --> 01:19:49.380
break down and get a dual platform technician

01:19:49.380 --> 01:19:53.620
because I want to play on Xbox Live. So, uh, yeah.

01:19:53.620 --> 01:19:57.140
I'm looking into getting both of those this week.

01:19:57.140 --> 01:20:00.140
Ultramix 2 and a new pad.

01:20:00.140 --> 01:20:04.140
Because Magus is dying anyway, so we'll just replace it.

01:20:04.140 --> 01:20:07.140
Then we can play doubles and stuff.

01:20:07.140 --> 01:20:10.140
Speaking of doubles, which is better, Ignition or Cobalt Flux?

01:20:10.140 --> 01:20:13.140
I couldn't tell you because I haven't really played enough Cobalt Flux.

01:20:13.140 --> 01:20:17.140
I saw it a little bit at E3, but I wasn't familiar enough with it.

01:20:17.140 --> 01:20:19.140
They're both the same fucking pad!

01:20:19.140 --> 01:20:22.140
The same damn thing with a different logo on it, that's all it is.

01:20:22.140 --> 01:20:23.140
You can't get much different.

01:20:23.140 --> 01:20:26.140
Oh, our metal is different than your metal!

01:20:26.140 --> 01:20:30.140
What about the quality and how many times could it be stepped?

01:20:30.140 --> 01:20:33.140
It doesn't matter, they're the fucking same.

01:20:33.140 --> 01:20:37.140
The goal said not even a rhino could beat down the pad.

01:20:37.140 --> 01:20:39.140
Oh yeah! Do they have a rhino to test this?

01:20:39.140 --> 01:20:43.140
Do they take it to Africa and go, hey rhino! Step on the pad!

01:20:43.140 --> 01:20:45.140
How do you like it? I mean, I'm sorry.

01:20:45.140 --> 01:20:49.140
So I can say, yeah guess what? Jupiter has nothing on this pad!

01:20:49.140 --> 01:20:52.140
This pad can fuck up Jupiter!

01:20:52.140 --> 01:20:55.140
Seriously, they're just pulling the shit out of their ass, okay?

01:20:55.140 --> 01:21:01.140
A rhino can't fuck this up. Oh, well, I guess what? Bigfoot recommends, you know, red octane. So, fuck that.

01:21:01.140 --> 01:21:07.140
It's stupid. Really, to be honest, when it comes down to pads, don't buy off the internet.

01:21:07.140 --> 01:21:12.140
Buy stuff that you can see at the store. Buy it like fries and stuff where you can actually see these pads.

01:21:12.140 --> 01:21:17.140
Because of the shit you get off the internet. Because I have bought metal pads, you know, off the internet.

01:21:17.140 --> 01:21:23.140
And, um, I stepped on them and they bent. They bent downwards. And I was like, what the fuck?

01:21:23.140 --> 01:21:28.380
it was retarded pads are not meant to be folded in half

01:21:28.380 --> 01:21:33.460
well talk about how they say SUVs can bust them on their advertisement

01:21:33.460 --> 01:21:37.020
our chat room over at www.orangelaunchradio.com clicking on chat

01:21:37.020 --> 01:21:42.060
interesting point there already is a DDR shit mix and it's the don't fall off mix

01:21:42.060 --> 01:21:45.820
the DDR extreme bootleg either the one that would speed up or actually there's

01:21:45.820 --> 01:21:52.220
two of them DDR extreme plus thank you yeah the one in country club land speed

01:21:52.220 --> 01:22:00.900
Let's beat up Max300 and see if we can beat it at 360ppm, oh wow, or hear Cartoon Heroes

01:22:00.900 --> 01:22:01.900
in a very high-touch voice.

01:22:01.900 --> 01:22:06.660
You know what, this is the other thing, I want to change the topic, because this is

01:22:06.660 --> 01:22:12.540
another topic I always see on Freak, and it comes up in many different kinds of discussions.

01:22:12.540 --> 01:22:15.540
It doesn't just come up on Freak, I've seen it even in our chat room, I've seen it on

01:22:15.540 --> 01:22:16.900
other sites.

01:22:16.900 --> 01:22:18.980
What is the deal with Cartoon Heroes?

01:22:18.980 --> 01:22:24.860
Why do so many people freaking love that song and are quick to label a mix as utter shit

01:22:24.860 --> 01:22:26.300
if that song isn't in it?

01:22:26.300 --> 01:22:28.120
I don't understand what's so great about the song.

01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:29.120
Is it a good song?

01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:30.120
Yeah, it's a great song.

01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:31.460
It was a little better when Aqua did it.

01:22:31.460 --> 01:22:32.460
But it's a good song.

01:22:32.460 --> 01:22:34.020
Is it fun to play?

01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:35.020
Kinda.

01:22:35.020 --> 01:22:36.900
I mean, I'll die when I play it.

01:22:36.900 --> 01:22:40.580
But why do so many people freaking obsess over Cartoon Heroes?

01:22:40.580 --> 01:22:46.420
Do you know how many people threw a fit when that song was in Extreme USA?

01:22:46.420 --> 01:22:53.420
look back in GDR history and view what we call the songs that ruin mixes. Starting with

01:22:55.760 --> 01:23:02.600
third mix, Afronova! Who could love this wonderful African chant as you jump around like a complete

01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:09.600
nut. Fourth mix, Kick the Can with this repetitive step over and over and over again.

01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:17.260
there's another contributing factor one two three four oh oh seven yes you're

01:23:17.260 --> 01:23:23.460
forgetting though my edit to kick the can aka big cans was awesome and made

01:23:23.460 --> 01:23:29.920
that song redeemable okay as I would continue on to fifth mix hot limits the

01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:32.940
song that's just you don't understand what they're saying but you know it's

01:23:32.940 --> 01:23:44.020
very long. Anyways, DDR Max, I'd say probably that would be Exotic Ethnic. It was pretty

01:23:44.020 --> 01:23:48.740
repetitive in DDR Max. Oh no, Flash in the Night. Yeah, that was another one. Flash in

01:23:48.740 --> 01:23:57.180
the Night. Hold on, your mic is still cutting out a little bit. Hold it at the bottom. A

01:23:57.180 --> 01:24:01.180
a little bit. Hold it at the bottom. Yeah, try it, try it. Put it close to the bottom.

01:24:01.180 --> 01:24:04.180
There you go. That's the same reason why Cartoon Heroes got

01:24:04.180 --> 01:24:08.180
bored. That's the same reason why So Deep is getting bored off with, like, DDR Max.

01:24:08.180 --> 01:24:13.180
Because it's like hard as hell 9. I would say, I would say the song that ruined

01:24:13.180 --> 01:24:18.180
DDR Max, even though I love this song, Cowgirl. Cowgirl, yes.

01:24:18.180 --> 01:24:25.180
Max 2, Sagaru, and who could not forget the song that had everyone dancing.

01:24:25.180 --> 01:24:27.180
Blow my whistle, bitch.

01:24:27.180 --> 01:24:29.180
Oh, God.

01:24:29.180 --> 01:24:32.180
Blow my whistle, bitch. Definitely ruined Max 2.

01:24:32.180 --> 01:24:35.180
Okay, so, make your point, please.

01:24:35.180 --> 01:24:37.180
My point is, I don't have a point.

01:24:37.180 --> 01:24:42.180
The point is that there's always going to be a song that people...

01:24:42.180 --> 01:24:45.180
It's catchy, and there's annoying catchy.

01:24:45.180 --> 01:24:48.620
To be honest, I hate cartoon heroes, and I know there's fifty-
