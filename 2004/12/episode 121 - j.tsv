90658	91898	Well, isn't that special?
96658	97098	We are live!
97459	99200	And this is episode number 121 for this
125600	128321	December the 5th of 2004.
128841	135983	You're tuned in to the B-Money Scene's most longest running radio station of all things B-Money.
136983	139063	My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.
139143	140884	Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts.
141344	144845	In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, back from her vacation.
144885	146505	Say hello to DarkSakura.
146905	149166	Oh my god, they wanted to keep me.
150746	152807	No, you can't let them keep you.
152867	153667	They all had grits.
155243	157844	I ate at the Waffle House!
158425	161126	And I had my hash browns smothered, covered, chunked, and diced.
161206	161706	Thank you.
165989	168150	All she's missing is her accent.
168930	170591	We'll talk more about the trip a little later on.
171311	176554	Also with us, as always, say hello to our tech massa who's setting up the webcam right now, Loki!
180461	181282	Let's try that again.
181362	186486	Say hello to our tech master, Loki!
191189	193551	Joining us tonight are some very special guests.
194332	195613	It's the usual crowd.
195793	197514	Say hello to DDR Angel.
198535	198875	Hello.
199716	201157	That's a very happy hello, isn't it?
202423	202843	Yes, it is.
203263	204984	And also say hello to Arcadian42.
205024	205604	Hi.
208505	208765	What?
211826	213687	Well, I want to talk about that when we come back.
213747	214407	That is crazy.
214947	217788	Because we just had an 80s pre-show and it kind of ties into that.
217828	219029	That little thing you're playing right there.
220711	223394	Yeah, we got a whole lot of interesting stuff to talk about tonight.
223474	224274	Actually, I'm lying.
224454	228057	There's really not a whole lot going on, but we're going to try to film three hours best we can anyway.
229898	234462	I know I want to talk about 8 Style tonight, Pop Music 10, because I got to play both those this week for the first time.
234862	240427	Of course, How's Your Week, How's Your Day, Cage Match, all that fun stuff when we come back after this break featuring...
241247	244530	Music from DDR Third Mix, because Third Mix was cool.
245151	247833	If you want to join us in our chat room, there's quite a little crowd there already.
247873	251816	Head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on chat.
252697	253438	We'll be right back.
253878	254999	After this, boys and girls.
258382	261685	Some of the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.
262422	266464	Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bomani Music and More program.
266505	267465	Can we talk about that?
267725	270047	No subject will ever be taboo.
270327	273949	Well, I was thinking maybe we should move Pump Up the Volume from Tuesday Nights.
274469	276991	Except, of course, a subject that was just under discussion.
277491	282794	Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?
283354	284615	I collect your fucking head.
286567	288068	Just like this fucker here.
289148	292810	Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki?
293070	296452	The hot thing on episode 69 was just a joke!
297373	303776	Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!
303796	308699	Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.
311644	314765	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
315865	318265	The lovely and wonderful Jamie there in that promo.
318425	319366	Well, sort of.
320646	321886	Ash played by Lucy Liu.
321986	322286	Yes.
322626	324247	You remember that a long time ago.
324567	331128	This was like probably the first year of Orange Lounge Radio, which it's sad that that could be considered retro, but it really is.
331368	340490	You remember way back during the first year of this program when somebody had talked about, I want to say it was Dark Tetsuya was somehow involved with this, brought up the casting of the Orange Lounge movie.
341585	345388	And they took votes in the chat room and they said that you should be played by Lucy Liu.
346068	346909	How ironic.
347009	348290	Which is, yeah, how ironic.
348470	349771	A little too ironic.
350071	352093	Especially considering you're not Asian at all.
352713	352913	No.
354414	354895	You know what?
355875	357717	I finally got something new when I went to Alabama.
358297	360659	That would be like me being played by Denzel Washington.
363311	364011	Anyway, sorry.
364352	364972	Yes, Alabama?
365072	368053	I got, um, I believe it was, I thought you were taller.
369434	371115	Alright, this is a good segue.
371135	375537	We've got to get into how was your week, how was your day, because I've got to figure out about what this is all about.
375577	376718	So, Jamie, how was your week, how was your day?
377578	380120	My couple of weeks were pretty decent.
380440	382821	Very, very, very, very, very, very busy.
384390	390855	Let's see, with my trip to Alabama, I got there, my mom got us lost and away from New Orleans.
391275	393277	We ended up heading up toward Hattiesburg.
394918	396439	There's something stuck in this thing.
396459	398241	Anyway, we ended up going up to Hattiesburg.
399369	402692	and then right when mom realized where we were we had to go around a different way so we headed home.
404694	406836	Got there, I didn't get in bed until 6 in the morning central.
407837	413321	That means I had been up an official 24 hours because I woke up at 4 pacific in the morning.
413362	413942	Congratulations.
415443	416104	My ass crashed.
417225	420648	Next day was Thanksgiving but we didn't do Thanksgiving stuff, we just slept.
424110	426131	I did some hanging out, you know, it was pretty cool.
428511	433333	Then on Friday I went to Dothan, saw my daddy, my Uncle Dale.
433853	436054	My Uncle Dale and my daddy are having their second childhoods.
436774	438855	My Uncle Dale has a... A.K.A.
438895	439635	midlife crisis.
440335	441335	2004 Mustang GT.
442136	443236	My daddy has a Camaro.
445757	450679	Yeah, my daddy is cute on the internet, because they have this old 500 megahertz kind of crappy thing.
452039	458261	And my daddy is so cute playing on it, because he just hunts and texts with little keys, and it's so cute.
458701	463323	And my daddy sends me everything in 72-point font and email.
465044	465604	It's adorable.
465704	467504	I used to be that way on AOL Instant Messenger.
467525	470726	I would type to everybody in huge 72-point font, and they'd be like, knock it off!
472850	477012	But I figured my chats are very important, and I want to make sure they're not missed.
479013	486937	Well, so Saturday, we had our official Thanksgiving at my uncle's house, and we had fried turkey.
488037	488638	Mmm.
488658	489878	What about deep fried turkey?
489938	490479	Deep fried turkey.
490519	492359	You know how dangerous that shit is to make?
493020	493880	Oh, but it's so yummy.
493900	497242	Well, my uncle had a very nice deep fryer with a lid and everything.
498596	502178	And it was very gummy because it makes all of the meat just super juicy.
502799	504520	And it had all kinds of things that I'm not supposed to eat.
505280	506861	On the way to Dothan, though, I had boiled peanuts.
507762	510663	And I passed by two movie galleries and saluted them for you, Loki.
511844	513685	Like, you know, the single finger salute.
513745	516207	Yes.
518128	519729	But I had a really good time.
519749	522751	And then that night, I went to Ground Zero.
523735	530739	which is a comic book store with gaming tables.
531099	534661	There were lots of people playing Yu-Gi-Oh and I felt really nerdy.
534882	537683	But downstairs there was an arcade there.
537723	538304	It was pretty cool.
538324	542446	That's a very strange name for an arcade in light of recent events.
543307	543927	Isn't it great?
544908	545288	Okay.
546388	548530	But there was...
550714	554015	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
574082	574603	I met Dork.
574683	574803	Yes.
595539	596920	I met quite a few people.
597000	601522	Actually, I met the... I'm supposing that he's in charge of the machines there.
601742	603863	He goes by Pyramus Online.
604703	605824	Very, very cool guy.
605924	607904	I went to a... I went to a Bomani party!
608305	608505	What?
609005	610365	You went to a Bomani party?
610546	611046	Yeah.
611546	613667	You just randomly got invited to a Bomani party down there?
613687	618849	They were all heading over, so I went over and played 8th Style on a widescreen TV, and that was rad.
618989	619649	Very nice.
619709	620530	So, you just...
621090	623336	You went over to strangers' houses to play video games?
623376	627466	We actually lived about a block away from where my ex-roommates lived.
628488	629471	So it was very close.
630289	640474	and I went over, of course, to hang out with my mama's son and my papa's son and K-Kitty and Bobby and we had a pretty good time.
640794	641674	We watched movies.
642155	647317	I saw the end of The Day After Tomorrow and no offense, but that movie sucks.
648478	652500	I don't think... That's my very professional opinion.
652520	654160	I don't know a lot of people who are going to disagree with you there.
654200	655061	My mom loves the movie.
655301	655941	They love the movie.
656321	659223	I don't really want to put down anyone else's opinion of it, but my opinion of it is crap.
664376	667605	I learned the fine art of DVD duplication.
668988	671730	and so I was able to deliver a copy of Kill Bill Volume 2.
672111	673652	Orange Launchator does not advocate piracy.
673692	676014	Yes it does.
677014	688243	And I got, actually you know there's that show Kindred the Embraced that came on based off of the White Wolf Universe and I have all the episodes they ever made of that because I think that the actor died.
689124	690625	The main guy who's playing the prince.
692446	694148	But I have all of that.
694168	697050	I still have it on my, if anyone brings me DVDs you'll get copies.
698764	701418	Um... Orange Sounds Radio does not advocate piracy.
701969	704510	It's actually, they're not... I'm just teasing.
705290	706250	They're not licensed right now.
706270	710591	Well, I want to find out more about this Bomani party, because basically you went over to a stranger's house.
711471	712471	I sang, Rob.
712531	715412	People that stalk us on the internet, right?
715512	717913	Are these people our listeners?
717973	721173	Yes, okay, so message to our listeners, stalking us works.
721873	726374	And, uh... I was hanging out with a lot of... A lot of the people, though, were people from DDR Freak.
726675	727355	Well, no, that's cool.
727595	728235	But, I mean, you got...
729235	732918	You've got the moderatorship on DDR Freak, so a lot of people know who you are over there.
734619	740824	The show's getting pretty big over there, thanks to the syndication on Friday nights over there on Freak Radio.
741164	742545	It was just a bunch of people.
742585	743746	I met a lot of good people.
745747	748369	We basically were just playing 8th style.
748389	751292	Now, we brought out Karaoke Revolution.
752870	754352	Now you don't sing karaoke.
754492	757815	I don't, but I got the line from Adventures in Babysitting.
758696	760718	Nobody leaves without singing the blues.
762180	763961	And that's all it took?
764001	765883	They didn't have to feed you Guinness or anything?
765903	766344	I was begged.
767594	769315	They didn't make you drink Guinness or anything?
769516	770756	You just did it perfectly sober?
770776	773838	I just figured it was going to be about another year before I'm back.
774639	778781	And you knew that there were no recording devices present, so... So I sang Bizarre Love Triangle.
778861	779642	Oh, no, that's a good song.
780022	780282	Yeah.
780622	783184	Now, see, you missed some karaoke action here on the show last week.
783644	784365	No, I didn't miss it.
784405	784805	I'm sorry.
786826	787086	Thing.
787206	787606	All right.
790548	794871	No, I actually, I was really... Loki's still pissed at me over it, by the way.
796115	824829	I actually was going to be trying to tune in on my laptop, but I had promised my mama-son I was going to take her to see The Grudge, which after having, since I was glad I saw Ju-on first, very glad I saw it first, because then, it was neat noting the differences in the movie, I'm not going to spoil it for anyone who hasn't, and actually, the thing that pissed me off is that I don't know the reason why they think they have to explain every single last fucking detail to a US audience.
825572	828854	When it's the not knowing that is the messed up part of the movie.
829654	831195	Even so, I thought it was very good.
832096	835818	And even better, especially since it was done by the original director.
837139	839640	So, um, we did that.
840000	841181	I went to Steak and Shake.
841581	843102	Steak and Shake is the best place ever.
843182	843462	What?
844303	845023	Steak and Shake.
845043	847885	Only in the South, which you have a place called Steak and Shake.
848185	850106	It's these thick hamburgers, really good.
850226	851947	It's like a little diner type place.
852327	854849	But you can get these humongous milkshakes and they make a half and half.
855727	856989	It's literally split down the middle.
857049	859431	Half one side is one flavor, half the other is the other.
859771	861733	So I actually mixed it up and had banana eggnog.
863475	863855	Huh.
864696	865477	Oh, God, it was good.
865977	867359	That was orgasm in a glass.
869981	870422	Anyway.
871883	873064	No, it didn't taste like tuna.
873084	874886	It tasted like banana and eggnog.
875687	876007	Damn it.
877008	877729	Anyway, um...
879321	881541	I got to meet lots of good people.
881561	882862	I had a really good time.
885122	888923	Monday, my brother was being an ass the whole time.
890303	893283	I'm not too proud of my brother Matthew.
894544	896124	I talked to my brother Phillip while I was there.
896764	900125	He's supposed to be down for Christmas, I think.
905526	906306	He's getting married.
907086	907966	Well, he's already married.
908615	917067	This is my brother who's a marine, and his wife's a marine, and they're actually going to Texas to have a humongous big Mexican wedding.
918393	919134	I'm going to go.
919154	921255	Because this is going to be a big party.
922316	923776	Will there be margaritas involved?
924477	924777	Likely.
924797	927279	Awesome.
927379	930401	Actually, people that know me pretty well know that I'm actually not a big tequila fan.
930641	934703	I'll drink margaritas because you can barely taste the tequila, but I cannot stand straight up tequila.
935324	938346	You know, you had that cheap shit here.
939626	940666	But I still don't like tequila.
940686	941567	You can give me Cuervo.
941627	941987	I don't care.
942007	942587	I still don't like it.
942607	944028	I can do shots of tequila.
944108	945508	I think it's nasty.
945828	948249	I like the Blue Agave tequila.
948949	953171	The stuff that Anita had way back at the Nasty House.
957512	959293	But it was pretty good.
959413	963334	I went back to New Orleans on Tuesday.
964134	965154	Hung out with my mommy.
965275	966115	I fussed at my mom.
966155	966555	It was fun.
968320	973785	and then Jamie Fuss had the most long, boring flight back.
974165	980170	I hung out at the Dallas airport for nearly two hours.
981571	983012	Airports aren't so bad now, though.
983032	983793	They have Wi-Fi there.
983833	984594	Yeah, they got Wi-Fi.
984614	986435	I was just chilling on my laptop.
986816	989498	Not just that, but everything there is to do.
989518	993261	They're practically shopping malls as well, although I would never buy anything there, but it's fun to look.
994002	995423	Airports aren't that bad anymore.
995936	996816	Well, some of them are.
997797	999917	But I was having a pretty good time, I mean.
1000197	1001057	And then I got on a plane.
1001397	1004538	I read the entirety of Ramsey's The Damned on the plane.
1005158	1011000	It's just, I have to say, safely, the Dust and Rice book, because all the rest of her stuff since, it's kind of crap.
1011020	1011760	It's been gay porn.
1012861	1014521	Yeah, but it's also some crappy.
1015861	1016762	Really crappy.
1017842	1019342	Woman needs to get her groove back.
1020703	1021543	Not rest on her name.
1023539	1027082	Although I did read the first novel of her Sleeping Beauty book.
1027943	1029163	Very interesting, very interesting.
1030084	1031746	Anyway, that was my trip.
1032046	1035288	The rest of the time I finished homework, put up with stupid crap.
1037236	1039558	You talking about that Bomani party makes me nostalgic.
1039578	1040939	Remember when we used to do that stuff?
1042100	1044783	At the old studio, which was a really great house for having parties.
1044843	1045944	We'd have the Bomani parties.
1046204	1047385	We need to do that shit again.
1047545	1048766	Yeah, we do.
1048806	1051169	Actually, we kinda had a Bomani party last night.
1051249	1055993	I mean, it wasn't like a hardcore Bomani party, but I'm sure we'll get to that as we go on through How's Your Week, How's Your Day.
1056013	1058335	You remember the stuff I would bring with me?
1058515	1058855	Oh, yeah.
1058875	1060937	People would say Bomani party, and I'm like, aw, shit.
1062539	1065941	I remember you brought your Dreamcast pads to one party.
1066222	1066622	Yes, I did.
1066642	1067402	That was insane.
1068300	1074324	I said, okay, this is what DDR was like in the old days before we had this vivid nonsense.
1074724	1083670	I remember when one of our old guests used to be on the show a bit, Somi Magus, when he put on his girlfriend's top and was playing Par Par Paradise.
1083970	1084251	Yeah.
1084311	1086872	And the picture made some rounds on the internet after that.
1087433	1094758	And I remember Loki would haul his computer and his Delight Delight reduplication and his pads he'd made for it.
1096519	1097179	I'm nostalgic.
1097439	1101863	I would carry around the Drum Mania, Keyboard Mania, 2DX Controller, the bunch of games.
1102403	1104544	All the old beat manias, my ASCII pad.
1106486	1117754	Do you think that when this DDR thing is dead, which, you know, could happen any day now, do you think that these Bomani parties are still going to be going on?
1117854	1119035	No, we'll just go back to porn.
1119075	1123658	We'll just have to go back to the orgies, you're right.
1124138	1125159	How silly of me to ask.
1128120	1131623	You know, we'd have to get that copy of Ally McFeel again.
1132844	1133524	That was funny.
1133704	1136006	Anyway, anything else you want to share about your week and your day?
1136026	1137688	Uh, no.
1137928	1139069	Moving right along, alright.
1141811	1145514	Hey, it had a cameo by Ron Jeremy.
1148875	1163394	Oh my god, I was looking up, um, there's a site online that's like, uh, these, uh, just paper dolls online, and I was trying to make, uh, a new avatar for myself on, uh, my live journal, and I accidentally came across the real doll site.
1164916	1165437	Oh god.
1165987	1167348	It's very, very icky.
1168289	1170431	I have a request for a new DDR Freak avatar.
1170492	1172393	Because the gay pimp one you made me is really cool.
1172413	1173675	I have a request for a new one.
1173795	1176277	I want a Xander from Drawn Together.
1177098	1178219	Just to make Seeker jealous.
1178760	1179240	From what?
1179440	1180962	Drawn Together, that show on Comedy Central.
1181282	1181723	From what?
1181803	1183184	Oh girl, you are so far behind.
1183585	1185707	I do not have anything but basic channels.
1186890	1187731	The local channels.
1187751	1188291	You're missing out.
1188351	1189091	It's a funny show.
1189731	1190592	I hardly ever watch TV.
1190692	1192193	And I think the TV is retarded.
1192253	1195234	I don't even watch Survivor or The Apprentice or any of that reality bullshit anymore.
1195774	1197035	Drawn Together is the only show I watch.
1197395	1198656	Oh, and look at Hell Freeze Over.
1199236	1200016	I know, I know.
1201377	1202717	You want to talk about Hell Freezing Over?
1202758	1206179	I came this close to joining a gym on Friday.
1207340	1207860	For, um...
1210700	1217085	For the people who didn't have that visual, Rob held his fingers the length of, um, never mind.
1217105	1219086	Because we're not going to talk about that.
1220307	1220608	Shut up.
1221588	1223270	No, because we don't bring up old drama.
1225151	1225451	Yeah.
1227232	1227613	What?
1229414	1229754	Oh, yeah.
1232823	1235125	And it says that when you said Xander, I started thinking of Buffy.
1235285	1241031	I need to respond to some... I need to respond to some stuff in the chatroom going on right now.
1241111	1245955	First off, Sigurd's telling me he hates me because of the Xander thing, and he says his is better.
1245975	1246315	Whatever.
1247176	1249538	And somebody else... Where was it?
1249938	1252080	A couple people commented, DDR's not gonna die!
1253442	1253702	Well...
1255082	1256223	I also have an announcement?
1256263	1256343	Yes.
1273368	1275429	I no longer am on the Atkins crap.
1275869	1276549	Well, not crap.
1276730	1277630	It's good for a lot of people.
1278070	1278951	It was not good for me.
1279951	1281412	So I can have sushi again.
1282172	1282892	Congratulations.
1283713	1284793	Sushi is wonderful.
1287034	1289195	And, and, and, and, and, and, and.
1290416	1290896	Nothing else.
1291296	1291616	Okay.
1292556	1292877	Oh, Rob.
1293057	1293317	Rob.
1293377	1293577	Rob.
1293617	1293797	Rob.
1293897	1294077	Rob.
1294117	1294317	Rob.
1294357	1294537	Rob.
1294577	1294697	Rob.
1294717	1294857	Rob.
1294897	1295178	Rob.
1295218	1295418	Rob.
1295458	1295638	Rob.
1295738	1295938	Rob.
1295978	1296118	Rob.
1296158	1296358	Rob.
1296398	1296738	Rob.
1296798	1296978	Rob.
1297018	1297198	Rob.
1297238	1297479	Rob.
1302199	1302539	Damn.
1302840	1304020	Angel, how was your week?
1304061	1304721	How was your day?
1304741	1307463	Angel, how was your week?
1308064	1308704	How was your day?
1309765	1315269	School was school and... Oh, nothing.
1315329	1316150	Saturday was nice.
1317751	1325438	I just wanted to waste the week away until Saturday came, because, well, I had a birthday.
1325558	1326258	Come on, everybody.
1326458	1327199	Yay.
1328520	1328840	Yay.
1328860	1329341	Yay.
1330805	1331065	Not.
1332666	1334367	Actually hanging out with everyone was great.
1337028	1345112	And we had played lots of Fumani, Eight Style, and Poppin' Ten.
1345913	1348134	So I got to see those for the first time, that was pretty cool.
1349655	1357499	And the best thing of all was obviously hanging around with people that I don't usually get to hang around with, so that was good.
1359361	1361983	and just enjoying my birthday weekend so far, I guess.
1366245	1368226	Now, Bradley, how was your week?
1368266	1368826	How was your day?
1370748	1374810	Alright, this week was work, of course.
1376010	1377611	And an interesting thing happened at work.
1377671	1381854	There was a person... My kind of work is sort of a training.
1381874	1383735	They train people to do stuff.
1383775	1385336	So one of the students came back.
1385396	1387397	He had some questions for her because he didn't do a test.
1388024	1388264	and so on.
1413793	1434082	The manager had to take him outside and talk for like an hour, try to calm him down, and then he came back on Friday, and his wife told him to bring along some candy just to give to us, or something like that, and he comes back and, okay, he's like, hell, here's this candy, and then he comes, and then he starts launching this big thing about discrimination!
1434402	1435423	He discriminates against me!
1435703	1436643	He doesn't like me!
1437364	1440445	And for some reason, some bullshit like that, and so...
1442713	1448877	Me and the receptionist are in the room and he's like, something kind of weird shit like that.
1451098	1457181	Good thing the boss came in a minute later and started talking to him so we could sneak out.
1458461	1463604	I went out in the hall for about an hour while they discussed something over and over again.
1463644	1469007	This is the kind of guy who says the same thing like ten fucking times to try to make some sort of point that
1469611	1470813	Were they getting paid for this?
1470833	1471153	To talk?
1481916	1495240	Well, it's a business, so... I always found that humorous when, you know, there's big fights going on and we have to sit down and have a discussion, but we're all getting paid for it, type thing, and we just wasted three hours of productivity to talk out.
1495680	1498681	Not that I ever get into disagreements with people, but, you know, I had to sit in on them.
1498701	1499681	Well, I didn't have anything to do with it.
1499701	1502062	I just went out and stood in the hall because I didn't want to get involved.
1502362	1503262	And you got paid for it, too.
1503602	1507823	Yeah, so it was a nice one hour break just to not do anything.
1508283	1510504	Just wait until it cooled down.
1511644	1518405	Uh, okay, and on Monday I got Katamari Damashii, and that was a lot of fun.
1518445	1533908	Sorry, every time something... It's like, it's like how when everybody says friends, you think of NBC, or when somebody says 90210, with Katamari it's... Shut up, Loki.
1533968	1539989	No, actually I think of that, I think of that song too.
1540839	1542861	and played that most every day this week.
1542961	1546623	Actually, I did play this every day this week, except for today, because I got up.
1547524	1559553	Last night was the party for Angel and Anita, or DD Archipelagic, for their birthdays, and that was a lot of fun, because Navi brought over 8th Style and Poppin' Music.
1559593	1561774	God bless the town's Poppin' Music whore.
1562715	1565137	I got to play on those Arcade Style controllers.
1566598	1567118	Yeah, and...
1569878	1596361	and that was fun which I didn't do all that great on 8th style because basically he had this he had it up on a stand and then the the TV was down like a two or three feet and several feet away so and I haven't played on like an arcade style controller in a long time and of course there was the just played like the hard news songs like oh god like oh what the hell is this called Nebula Grasper Nebula Grasper is a fucking impossible
1597318	1599520	Well, at least for a first try, it's like, what?
1599540	1600000	What the hell?
1600480	1601141	All over the place.
1602562	1616611	And I always love non-Bamani peoples, like the people who don't really play 2DX and DDR and stuff, I always love their reaction to stuff like that, because there were a few people at the party last night who don't really play DDR or 2DX, and they were just kind of watching Navi playing, and he was just crazy.
1616651	1622315	He was playing like Nebula Grasper or another or something, and everybody was just kind of like, that's crazy.
1623776	1624737	That is so crazy.
1626641	1627642	Man, that's crazy.
1629623	1636088	Yeah, actually I played pop music for the first time ever, because it's the first time I've actually been to anything where it's been brought out.
1636989	1641753	And I actually passed like a, I think I passed 22 on 9 button.
1642894	1643434	That was pretty good.
1645636	1649219	And today we got up late, so it didn't do all that much.
1650660	1651000	That's all.
1652501	1654823	Mr. Loki, how was your week, how was your day?
1657301	1669645	Today did not start out too good due to certain events that have taken place outside of our apartment complex in the street.
1670565	1671265	It was not fun.
1671365	1672666	Well, we'll get into that later, I'm sure.
1673286	1677988	And then yesterday, it was okay.
1678448	1679048	Went and...
1680209	1680609	DarkSakura.com
1696956	1698458	I can't remember Thursday.
1698579	1699860	Thursday was okay, I guess.
1700862	1708312	Most of the week I've been just playing Final Fantasy XI, leveling my summoner to 20, which I just finished right before the show.
1709133	1710034	And, um...
1711756	1712557	What else have I been doing?
1712617	1719562	I've played a little bit of Grand Theft Auto, finally passed this mission that I couldn't beat for a while, and now I have to run errands for some pimp.
1720523	1725066	And, um... Went and saw Closer, I'll get into that later.
1726187	1729650	And, um... Eh, that's about all.
1729670	1734374	It's been, like, kind of a week just crashing into the ground.
1735695	1737076	That sucks about your grandma, I'm sorry to hear it.
1738557	1738857	Eh, okay.
1739518	1741359	Have you used your machine to try and contact her yet?
1742771	1744153	No, I have not, you asshole.
1747298	1747639	Anyway.
1747659	1750703	Did you ever open your portal to hell?
1751605	1754710	I was gonna say, you went on a ghostbusting trip yesterday, didn't you?
1755150	1755631	Hunting.
1755871	1757334	Ghost hunting, not busting.
1758064	1780433	We just, we went, walked around Knights Ferry, which is basically this old abandoned, it's not really an abandoned mining town, it's just an old, um, mining town, it's got like a bunch of dilapidated, it's not really a mining town, I guess, they have an old, um, mill there that's kind of been, um, it's just the ruins of it, so we just walked around there, and they also have a very long, um, they have a 115 meter, um,
1781773	1782934	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1798969	1803973	My example was something that's more trauma there than, you know, old.
1804313	1808576	You know, because necessarily just visiting any old place is not going to work.
1808596	1813219	You need to have something where, oh yeah, 50 people murdered there, you know, that kind of thing.
1813299	1816981	Just something, you know, traumatic, like a sane asylum or something like that.
1817342	1820344	But, you know, no luck with any of that stuff around here, so.
1821004	1821244	Oh well.
1823386	1824927	So yeah, that's what I've been doing.
1825307	1826708	Isn't this place the insane asylum?
1827856	1828396	Not yet.
1828576	1830177	I have to haunt this place first.
1830337	1831918	I haven't quite gotten around to that yet.
1833038	1835919	Soon enough, you know, I've been, like, I have my priorities.
1835939	1838520	Like, I was going to work on the cabin today, and then I just got tired.
1839261	1840401	Those fuckers this morning.
1842022	1846023	And by tired, he means looking for a party in Final Fantasy XI so he can get his summoner to level 20.
1846084	1846324	At it!
1847907	1851371	No, I was tired from other things, but yes, I just got bored of that too.
1851511	1860522	But the other things in the morning made me tired because I'm exhausted right now from having to wake up early yesterday and having to wake up early today.
1863479	1864720	All right, my turn, my week and my day.
1865021	1869405	I got to play 8th Style and Pop Music 10 twice this week, actually, because I hung out with Navi on Monday.
1869646	1873169	I'll talk about those games a little bit later, because, you know, I want to talk about my mommy stuff a little bit.
1873890	1881278	But Navi and I, after playing some of that, we got to go to the mall, and I was going to help him do some Christmas shopping over at Arden Fair, which is a big mall in Sacramento.
1881318	1881799	It's a huge mall.
1883039	1884840	And so we ended up walking out of there.
1884880	1886061	He didn't end up buying anything.
1886101	1887721	He just kind of looked around at some different places.
1888182	1891363	And I fucking bought an iPod at the Apple store.
1892323	1894144	Because I wanted one, really.
1895144	1896545	I wanted one really badly.
1896625	1898146	I'm still two away from my free one.
1898166	1900907	Why don't you just buy a fucking iMac, you know?
1901567	1902627	Just join the cult.
1902807	1904108	I've thought about it, actually.
1905268	1908290	Good, it's a big flaming piece of shit that doesn't do anything.
1909050	1910030	You make Apple users cry.
1910090	1911211	Unless you're into graphics.
1912319	1914940	or Media, which, you know, this show happens to be.
1914960	1916361	Because all the pros are on Macs.
1916581	1918923	Maybe we wouldn't have the freaking buzz on a Mac.
1919723	1920063	Anyway.
1920083	1922404	We wouldn't have any of the software either.
1923585	1925006	Anyway, besides that.
1925026	1925766	Virtual PC.
1925966	1926667	Besides this.
1927027	1928568	Oh yeah, I have to emulate a good PC.
1930912	1934415	I just wanted an iPod actually because the stereo in my car broke a while back.
1934535	1940619	Actually, it was Sigurd's Echo Image CD that broke my CD player in the car actually because it ate it and wouldn't give it back one day.
1941680	1944042	Once it heard Echo Image, it could hear no other music.
1945002	1947244	Basically, it's how it all boiled down.
1948585	1953829	So, it won't eject CDs anymore and now it won't even play the CD that's in there.
1953889	1954029	So,
1954489	1961715	Luckily, though, it has an auxiliary port in it, so I can plug anything I want in there, so I'm just like, fuck it, I'm gonna get an iPod, and I'll just use that as my car stereo.
1962015	1972564	So it's worked out really well, except for the fact that if you think I'm bad when I'm talking on my cell phone and trying to drive, you should see me when I'm trying to find the song on my iPod I want to hear and drive at the same time.
1974225	1974766	It's beautiful.
1976329	2003821	and you know what they can pass all the laws they want to say I can't talk on my cell phone and drive but I don't see them making any law anytime soon that says I can't play on my iPod and try to drive at the same time so look out I believe the law is operation of electronic devices while driving so your iPod's included god damn it extraneous like CD like laptops peripheral devices
2005618	2016565	Um, Sigurd in our chatroom right now over at OrangeLaunchRadio.com, he says that that day where my echo image, or his echo image CD got eaten by my car stereo player, he said that that day kind of pissed him off.
2016925	2021808	Except for the Classic Gaming Expo and the little girl that was hitting all the buttons on the restrooms that she rocked.
2022189	2027072	And that reminds me, I actually found the picture of Jamie doing that at Classic Gaming Expo.
2027392	2028853	I had my heads in the air.
2028873	2029954	What was it?
2029994	2031676	We paid you $10 to do it?
2031776	2032176	Yeah.
2032257	2034218	And I spent it on Pac-Land for the TurboGrafx.
2034238	2037822	Yeah, we bought some game for you, basically, for you to imitate a little girl.
2037882	2038702	I found the picture.
2038783	2039743	I'm going to send it to Sigurd.
2042626	2044868	By the way, we're going to the Classic Gaming Expo again this year.
2045569	2047070	Even though... It's a bowling game.
2047491	2053136	Even though last year was kind of... The only reason that last year's was eh was because they had that thing a few days before.
2054182	2056384	The Classic Gaming Expo this year is going to be in Burlingame.
2056424	2058365	That means trips to network video.
2060007	2061568	And the store that sells the airsoft guns.
2064410	2066571	Alright, and I guess that was pretty much my week of my day.
2066651	2075118	I spent a lot of time playing Final Fantasy XI as well because basically I got stood up Friday night, so I decided to wither away my sorrows inside a nice game of Final Fantasy XI, so...
2076138	2085104	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2098752	2101635	The freaking game took us three hours to play.
2102035	2104217	The last time I played Cranium it only took two.
2104557	2106379	Turbo Cranium ended up taking longer.
2106599	2107700	What in the hell is up with that?
2107780	2109842	And no, it's not because we kept taking breaks.
2109962	2111543	It just was a long-ass game.
2111563	2112204	It was no shorter.
2112944	2116828	Nobody's gonna get this joke but you, Rob, but you can be my puppet master any time.
2118103	2122347	How foul.
2122367	2124809	I ended up having to leave around midnight because I was kind of afraid.
2124989	2129333	Well, A, I was tired, and B, I was afraid I wasn't going to be able to park when I got back here if I waited any longer.
2129393	2130534	But how was the rest of the night?
2131375	2131575	Good.
2131615	2137140	We ended up playing Hear Me Out for the majority of the night.
2137180	2141724	I mean, we played Poppin' 10 also, but yeah, that other game was kind of weird.
2143320	2146882	Also, a DD Alcoholic made sushi from scratch.
2146902	2150004	It was really good, but it was kind of interesting because she used wieners in it.
2150124	2152145	Like, she used hot dogs instead of fish.
2152165	2153385	She put, like, hot dogs in there.
2153705	2154706	But it was actually really good.
2154726	2155426	It was kind of weird.
2156067	2157007	I just thought it was neat.
2157307	2158268	It was very resourceful.
2158288	2158808	It was a good idea.
2159889	2160089	Anyway.
2161830	2162731	We're going to take a break.
2162751	2165413	When we come back from this break, we're going to talk a little bit more about 2DX8 style.
2165433	2167194	We're going to talk a little more about Pop Music 10.
2167875	2171518	I want to play the new remix of I Feel for you guys.
2171558	2176842	We played it on Thursday night, but I know nobody listens to Outside the Box on Thursday night, but more of you guys listened tonight.
2176862	2185128	So we're going to play the new I Feel mix from Service Pack 7 from Ultramix 2, because a lot of people don't want to hear that.
2185148	2185989	So we're going to play that for you guys.
2186289	2188030	and plenty more when we come back from this break.
2188090	2191033	In this break, though, some music from DDR Festival.
2191373	2195216	Because we haven't really gotten to hear much music from DDR Festival yet, but we have some songs for you guys.
2195236	2200039	We're going to hear Superstar, Diamonds, and Cutie Honey on this break.
2200359	2201020	We'll be right back.
2202819	2215172	It's honestly, I didn't bother to buy Festival, I just, I didn't think there was enough in it for me, because I had Extreme, and I have an Xbox, so, and I had Ultramix One, which are a lot of songs came from, but Festival certainly has some quirky little songs in it, doesn't it?
2216013	2217374	Interesting, that's all I have to say.
2217794	2223060	Although I love Superstar, I, it's almost worth buying the mix for that, but not really, because that's like 80 bucks.
2223280	2224641	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2247837	2248537	2DX8Style.
2248978	2253139	Got a chance to check it out over at Navi, Pop Music Horror.
2253159	2253539	He has it.
2253559	2254859	I got to check it out earlier this week.
2255239	2256960	And man, do I suck at 2DX now.
2257040	2257620	I mean, seriously.
2257640	2258440	Oh my god, me too.
2258540	2261061	I haven't played 2DX seriously in quite a while.
2261161	2262481	I didn't really get into 7Style.
2262501	2263342	I played it one time.
2264122	2274925	A lot of this has to do with the fact that my controller is broken, and I'd rather buy myself a lot of other useless crap, like iPods and things like that, than buy a new 2DX controller.
2275405	2278227	and I seriously think that's the reason that I haven't been playing a whole lot of 2DX.
2278527	2280989	The 8th style is pretty sweet, I gotta say.
2281009	2282390	It has a lot of great new songs in it.
2283251	2287674	For those of you guys that listen to this show regularly, you already know how I feel about Everyday Lovely Day, like I love that song.
2287994	2289996	And then of course it has a bunch of 2DX Red songs in it.
2291496	2295878	Well, not a bunch, but three, which I consider to be a bunch for, you know, preview, because usually it's only like one or two.
2297879	2301060	And then some of the new consumer videos are pretty funny.
2301860	2303061	Like, Step Into the New World.
2303301	2304721	I don't really like that song a whole lot.
2304761	2305782	The song kind of, meh.
2306222	2309963	But the video's pretty great, like, with the anime and everything and the guy running down the street.
2309983	2313145	And he uses this computer animation technique that's very interesting.
2313225	2315645	Like, it turns these 2D settings into 3D.
2315906	2317226	Kind of like Parappa, the rapper.
2317246	2319027	It looks like that, except not drawn.
2320047	2322168	I guess that makes no sense whatsoever, I don't care.
2323289	2326590	And then also another video I love is Lovebox.
2326851	2335315	I don't know if you guys got to see this video at all, but Lovebox is the one that has, I think it's Meg and one of her cohorts or something, I don't know, an uncredited person.
2335995	2339417	They're dressed up as these like Austin Powers dance chicks, kind of.
2340237	2344678	Like, they're all dressed in these, uh, like, 60s hippie, like, things you'd see on Laugh-In.
2344698	2345678	You remember that old show Laugh-In?
2346018	2347199	Like, when the people would be dancing?
2347839	2353780	It was kind of like that, and they're just driving around the city and singing, and they're wearing, like, glow bracelets and stuff.
2354240	2355000	It's really great.
2355840	2356340	Love Fox.
2356500	2357581	I highly recommend this one.
2358901	2362242	Although the song kind of sucks, but the video's great.
2364602	2366883	So, you guys have gotten to play 8-Style a little bit, too.
2366923	2368163	What do you guys think of 2DX 8-Style?
2370191	2371852	I was stuck in Let Me Go with Bella.
2372853	2374094	Oh, I remember that song was so great.
2374114	2375716	And the scene kept falling out of my lap.
2376977	2377757	I miss arcades.
2380920	2384002	Um, were you playing on a regular, like, little controller?
2384183	2384483	Yeah.
2384543	2387325	See, now he has one of those arcade-style controllers, so you don't have to put it in your lap.
2387625	2391669	But they're kind of loud, like, they're really, those arcade-style ones are really loud.
2391709	2395312	Like, you could hear that thing probably outside, like, a mile away, clack, clack, clack, but...
2396058	2396518	That's pretty neat.
2396619	2399801	And sometimes it kind of overpowers the music, but it plays beautifully.
2399921	2400802	It plays so beautifully.
2401903	2403905	Arcadian, what do you think of 2DX8Style?
2404645	2405246	Looks pretty nice.
2405446	2405726	Yeah?
2406267	2408008	Is this something you think you might have to break down and purchase?
2408348	2409189	I already have purchased it.
2409329	2409769	Oh, have you?
2410030	2410810	I haven't gotten it yet.
2411030	2411131	Oh.
2411951	2413252	You probably mentioned it, I forgot.
2413653	2415154	Yeah, I mentioned it like two weeks ago.
2415174	2415554	That's right.
2415854	2416215	I forgot.
2419498	2422220	Any particularly favorite consumer songs that you like in 8Style?
2423630	2427550	I haven't heard him enough to truly say yes.
2429093	2437258	I played a new 7-star, I think it was Don't Be Afraid Myself, was one of the, like, it's the J-pop one, it's got a really, it's actually got a pretty That song was great!
2437398	2438819	That's got a pretty cool video to it.
2438839	2440100	Didn't it have a video in the bathroom?
2440600	2441100	In the shower?
2441500	2442441	I think so.
2442461	2444762	It was like they were dancing in, like, a locker room shower.
2444842	2445903	Yes, I think that might have been it.
2445983	2447964	I could only kind of half-see the video because I can't play the song.
2447984	2448465	That song was cool!
2448625	2451586	Yeah, the song is cool, but man, I fucked up that song so bad.
2451806	2455869	Like, it really shows, like, how out of it on 2DX I am because I can't sight-read anymore.
2456229	2460653	I was able to play Attitude and Stardream and all these songs I used to play all the time on 8thStyle.
2460673	2461774	I was able to play those just fine.
2462054	2466298	But man, throw something new at me and the rhythms and everything didn't make any sense to me.
2466638	2467319	It was so sad.
2468340	2469541	I cry for my 2DX skills.
2470422	2471042	But Dancer.
2471923	2473925	8thStyle was worth it just to be able to play Dancer again.
2474005	2476827	Although, is it just me or is something kind of weird at the end of the video?
2476927	2479490	Like it freezes kind of at the end of the video.
2479750	2481511	I remember it kind of faded out in the arcade.
2481551	2482372	Maybe I'm just crazy.
2482572	2482872	I don't know.
2483633	2489238	But a lot of 8-style machines had broken videos in the first place, so it was probably the first time a lot of people got to actually play 2DX with the videos.
2489258	2490259	I don't know, pretty cool.
2491100	2492661	Angel, what were your thoughts on 2DX 8-style?
2493982	2498026	Lovage, Orange, Attitude, and A. That's all I have to say.
2498646	2504591	Because, you know, I used to watch you guys play that all the time, and I was always all envious, and I still am, so, yeah.
2504931	2505152	Yeah.
2507145	2511688	A is technically a 7th style song, but it does make a repeat in 8th style.
2511828	2519673	It's interesting, they took some of the most noteworthy 7th style songs, like A and Stoic, and they ended up repeating on 8th style after all.
2519693	2521674	So now I'm kind of like, do I really need to get 7th style?
2522274	2528298	But then I remembered, yes, I want to whore Beauty of Silence in the privacy of my own home, is basically what it boils down to.
2528738	2530179	Just like, remember the old arcade days?
2530339	2532040	Frickin' everybody whored Beauty of Silence.
2532080	2532841	Well, almost everybody.
2533801	2534982	I know I was a big part of that, but...
2536387	2539560	Like, player's best would be 5-1-1, because all the noobs would play 5-1-1.
2539580	2540604	And then, like, Beauty is Silenced.
2544065	2548709	Anyway, moving on, Poppin' Music 10 was another game I got to check out earlier this week.
2549450	2553993	Pretty cool, I have to admit, I think I kind of like the way 9 is set up a little bit better.
2554093	2569226	I thought the unlock system in 9 was a lot cooler, because 10 has this wacky roulette thing, and Navi had the timing down perfect, though, so that he was managing to unlock quite a bit of stuff on the roulette wheel, but it was kind of yawn to me, because the Gambler's E thing in 9 was
2569606	2570827	I was a little disappointed by that
2596202	2598803	The middle one, wherever it's ranked, like a 30 or something.
2598823	2600103	29, 30, I don't remember.
2601884	2603845	Somebody needs to get me $1,000 for Christmas.
2603985	2614128	So that way I can buy an ASC for 2DX, an ASC for pop music, and then import 8th style and as many pop music as they can before I'm bankrupt.
2615028	2622291	So if you guys want to get me $1,000 for Christmas, that would be great.
2622391	2622711	Yeah.
2622791	2625372	Did you play Poppin' 10 at all at that party that you went to, Jamie?
2626932	2627853	I didn't have Poppin' 10.
2628053	2630734	Oh, I thought maybe... I brought Poppin' 9 with me, but we ended up not playing it.
2630995	2631115	Oh.
2631895	2632135	Okay.
2632736	2634797	Well, what did you think of Poppin' Music 10, Angel?
2636098	2640322	It was pretty, and watching Navi play is just insane.
2640883	2654716	He plays faster than anyone else I've seen, you know, but I just ended up watching it because I knew a lot of people wanted to play Pop Intense, so I just kind of left it at that.
2655197	2657599	Plus we were busy with Cranium anyway, so, you know.
2659833	2664197	Yeah, by the way, if anybody wants to call us, we just opened up the Skype line.
2664238	2670003	If you want to figure out what that's all about, head on over to www.orangelondradio.com and click on Interact With Us.
2670524	2676049	And we want to take some phone calls asking you guys that have gotten a chance to play 8th Style or Pop Music 10, what you guys think of it.
2676470	2678892	I have to say that the final verdict on 10, I kind of...
2680273	2685996	I mean, obviously I need to play it more, and obviously I still want it, but I still think I kind of like 9 just a little bit better.
2686636	2693119	I just think 9 had some, it was just set up a little better, and just kind of had some better songs, but 10's really good, don't get me wrong.
2693179	2696420	I would still buy 10 in a heartbeat, but I just think I like 9 a little bit better.
2697721	2699021	But, anyway.
2700302	2703043	Arcadian, you got to play a little bit of Poppin' 10, what'd you think?
2704143	2704543	Real fast.
2704884	2705804	Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
2706741	2708403	Hey there, Sky, Siggy here.
2708603	2709504	Hi Siggy, how you doing?
2710265	2711647	I'm doing fine.
2711787	2713209	You know what?
2713669	2716993	I finally figured out what you were talking about last week with the 2DX8 style.
2717033	2720497	You remember how you said there was something in it that looked like extreme US?
2720858	2723060	And a lot of people in the chat room went, what the fuck is he talking about?
2723180	2724122	That kind of thing, remember that?
2725102	2726082	I got what you meant now.
2726142	2731024	It was the menu in the beginning, kind of had that round wheel thing.
2731724	2732604	Yeah, it's the menu.
2732944	2733405	Gotcha.
2733805	2736125	So, you got your copy of 8th Style, yes?
2736445	2736646	Yep.
2736926	2737906	And how have you been enjoying it?
2739386	2740087	It's really good.
2740787	2746108	I was one of the lucky ones who got the 2DX Red e-amusement card, because after November 18th, they don't have it anymore.
2746508	2746888	Really?
2747409	2747709	Yeah.
2747889	2751930	So, is there anything special about the card, or is it just the fact that, hey, I got a card?
2753136	2759519	Actually, I wanted to use the 2DX red e-amusement card at AI, because they have the e-amusement card readers.
2759559	2760320	That's what I heard.
2761260	2766443	Now, I'm actually going to be able to go to Arcade Infinity next week, I'm hoping.
2766843	2767984	The e-amusement card over there.
2769564	2770145	I'm thinking about it.
2770825	2771565	Yeah, that's cool.
2771765	2772606	Yeah, thinking about it.
2774427	2776128	Recently, I double-aided a V-35.
2778397	2783982	See, V35 is one of those songs I used to be really good at, but then I just suck it up now.
2784002	2784883	What is that you're holding up there?
2784983	2785503	A Namco?
2786364	2787966	My Tekken 5 character data card.
2788846	2789607	Get on topic!
2790748	2791248	No, it's cool.
2792189	2793571	Have you gotten to play Pop Music 10 at all?
2794271	2794852	Uh, no.
2795532	2799316	The last time I played a Pop Music was Pop Music 9 back in San Francisco.
2799556	2800957	See, but isn't Pop Music 9 great?
2803579	2804240	I think so, anyway.
2804893	2809457	Uh, so, anything else you wanna share about 2DX8Style, your experiences you're having with it?
2810298	2824469	Well, um, there's a, there's a thing, uh, about the, uh, getting the, the hidden songs, uh, 2DX, 2DX Red songs, you don't have to, you don't have to, uh, about, about the easy thing, it's, it's, it turns out to be false.
2825710	2826310	What, what do you mean?
2826651	2833616	You can't, you can't play, you can't play, uh, easy songs by, by unlocking, uh, by unlocking Tayo.
2833636	2834237	Mm-hmm.
2835104	2837645	by using an easy option.
2838126	2839947	So you can't play an easy to unlock those songs?
2840327	2840767	You can.
2841067	2841647	Oh, you can?
2842148	2842408	Yeah.
2842488	2843909	Well, shit, that makes it easy, doesn't it?
2845209	2848171	And what is the requirement again to start unlocking some of these 2DX Red songs?
2848191	2849131	Because I actually don't remember.
2849652	2855194	Play at least about 100 songs to unlock Spiral Galaxy and Taiyou.
2856575	2856895	Wow.
2856915	2857796	100 songs?
2858922	2864485	Well, yeah, just mostly light sevens or, you know, light seven to seven key songs.
2864925	2866626	I'm not afraid of playing seven key.
2866646	2868468	I've got to play some more to get better at it.
2868568	2870108	I think it's... Play more light seven.
2870329	2871769	Just, you know, just for the heck of it.
2871809	2872270	Just for the heck.
2872510	2880114	I would play... Now, see, light seven would be the kind of thing I would play to whore my VJ Army account up if I had one.
2880414	2881695	Hypothetically, if I had one.
2881735	2884077	I'd be all, look at all these triple A's I got.
2884097	2884977	Of course, it was on light seven.
2884997	2885377	But, man...
2886778	2889981	I'm good, because I know that there's people out there that do that.
2890181	2894144	I mean, but that's okay, you know, light sevens are songs too, you have every right, but you know.
2895485	2897446	And there's another for random plus.
2897866	2900829	You have to play at least a hundred songs to unlock random plus.
2901149	2907874	And what exactly does random plus do again for those that... Random plus is where the turntable is now included in the shuffle.
2908834	2910976	Oh, okay, I gotcha.
2911236	2916160	Oh, that would be so hard if you got some scales that, oh god, that's crazy.
2916817	2920520	Especially, you know, especially Wargame.
2921301	2922142	I hate that song.
2922182	2923262	I can only imagine.
2923503	2926205	Well, Wargame on 7-key was never a big problem for me.
2926245	2930288	For some reason, Scratching, I'm like, I'm okay with it.
2930629	2934792	Checking you out was the second 7-star I ever beat, and now I understand it's an 8-star.
2935173	2939196	So, like, I beat an 8-star, like, when I was beating my first 7-star.
2939216	2940357	That is so crazy to me.
2940597	2942499	But, for some reason, Scratching has never bothered me.
2943394	2952079	After you play 100 songs with random, just hold the whole key 2 and then wait for the random to go red.
2953239	2954000	And that's how it works?
2954520	2955341	Yeah, that's how it works.
2955561	2960063	So those of you guys that are feeling a little crazy and want to play some random with the turntable, there you have it.
2961624	2961964	Interesting.
2962304	2965626	What would you say would be your favorite new video in 2DXA style?
2966407	2968528	I haven't seen all of them because I'm really busy playing...
2969963	2971143	Playing the seven key songs.
2971523	2974264	But I say, I like Nebula Grasper a lot.
2974484	2976264	Nebula Grasper's got a pretty good video to it.
2976304	2978925	It's one of those futuristic, typical kind of things.
2978965	2981185	It kind of reminded me of Hyperboundary Yate a little bit.
2981225	2985046	Because, you know, that was an LED song too, and it had all the futuristic graphics with it.
2985286	2986346	Kind of reminded me of that a little bit.
2987006	2991967	And I bought a 2DX Red, so I really like Spiral Galaxy as well.
2992547	2997448	Now, were you able to get the V-Rare when you got... Oh, no, no, I didn't.
2998088	2999348	Just a regular one I ordered.
2999714	2999974	Oh, okay.
3000975	3001255	All right.
3001836	3003758	Well, anything else you want to share about 2DX ASO?
3004398	3005799	Well, nothing much else.
3005999	3006280	All right.
3006400	3008061	Well, we'll talk to you later then, I guess.
3008722	3009362	Have a good one, Siggy.
3009763	3010023	All right.
3010063	3010283	Later.
3010423	3010703	Later.
3011804	3012785	I like getting phone calls.
3012825	3013346	That was fun.
3014366	3014647	All right.
3015247	3018109	People say in our chat room right now is that they're talking about 2DX too much.
3018129	3021012	Well, it is the news that's going on right now, you know, you guys, but fine.
3022204	3023706	We're going to talk about a little bit of DDR.
3023746	3027751	We're going to try and get the I Feel, the new remix for you.
3027791	3030995	Loki's going to get that taken care of during the next break, right?
3031616	3031896	Yeah.
3032217	3032437	Good.
3032557	3034480	Then I guess we're going to go to a break so we can get that song.
3034740	3037424	We're going to hear some music from DDR Festival, some more music.
3037444	3037944	Yes, Jamie.
3039726	3039907	What?
3041628	3045072	We'll do the second mix break in a bit, but I want to get the festival stuff taken care of first.
3045432	3050537	Yes, I did threaten the chat room with some Butterfly, and I know that's first mix, but I want to get that in there too, at some point.
3050598	3052520	So we'll see what you can do.
3052800	3056524	But in this break, a different version of Udorup.
3057224	3057985	I can't even say this.
3058025	3059667	You know the Captain Jack song from fifth mix?
3059787	3061188	Udorup, pom-pom-pom, or whatever, pom-pom-pom.
3061949	3064391	I need you I need you I need you
3088613	3089433	All right, that wasn't too bad.
3089554	3090294	All right, so we'll check it out.
3090314	3096277	We're going to check out these songs, and we'll be back, and we're going to talk a little bit more about Ultramix 2, some of the news there, and play that new song from Ultramix 2.
3096437	3099478	And, of course, the Cage Match, FU's of the Week, all that good stuff coming up.
3099998	3106101	And in the chat room, they're saying, look, since you're so white, Sky, just say Dancine Pomponcolin.
3106541	3107842	And even that I can't say right.
3108162	3109783	I just, I wasn't cut out for radio.
3109823	3110303	What can I say?
3110783	3111784	We'll be back.
3111804	3112084	Crazy.
3113643	3117026	Anyway, we are going to be playing the new I Feel remix.
3117046	3119267	We ripped it during the break there.
3119327	3122989	Loki, our tech massa, is working on it right now, trying to get it all perfect.
3123390	3135137	I said we should just rip it out of edit mode, but apparently if you try to rip it in edit mode, it cuts off the very beginning little speech thing, because it starts off with, like, it sounds like one of those speaking spells or something saying it.
3135757	3138279	And Loki was like, no, we can't have that!
3138539	3141281	So he made us go back and do it in edit mode, so whatever.
3141921	3142501	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3169386	3173369	That's Pump Up the Volume where I just go crazy and play whatever.
3173990	3176312	Although if you're in our chat room, you can make a request.
3176412	3178934	And if I think that it doesn't totally suck ass, I'll play it.
3179815	3180335	Amen to that.
3181256	3182557	And then Wednesday night.
3183695	3189377	as the oldie and moldy Orange Lounge radio show where basically we play a show from two years ago for your listening amusement.
3189737	3191138	Listen to how much we used to suck.
3191178	3193759	If you think we suck now, like we really sucked then.
3194939	3203343	And then Thursday nights, outside the box at 7 o'clock, myself, Rice Princess, and LankyStyle talking about the latest and greatest in video gaming.
3203643	3205123	This last week was a pretty good show.
3205163	3206664	You missed a good time if you missed this week.
3206724	3207744	We had a good time.
3208505	3209365	And then Friday nights,
3209744	3212926	It's not on this station, but it's over on The Freak on DDR Freak Radio.
3212966	3218449	The Rewinds, in case you missed a previous episode of Orange Lounge Radio, you can catch it over there, up to date.
3219050	3224173	Actually, the show they're going to be playing this Friday is last week's show, which was the one where we had the Middyhead interview.
3224573	3228695	If you guys missed the interview with Middyhead, awesome guy, awesome interview.
3228755	3231117	You have to check it out, so go listen to Freak on Friday.
3231197	3236940	Also, the karaoke cage match, by the way, was on last Friday, and of course, Loki won.
3236980	3238822	Was there any surprise in anyone's mind?
3238982	3239462	I don't think so.
3241195	3245218	I've got to plug the LiveJournal community because we haven't plugged that in a while.
3245998	3253964	If you guys have a LiveJournal, which I know a lot of you do in this day and age, we're starting to move into a LiveJournally-centered internet, head on over to our LiveJournal community.
3254024	3255985	It's just username OrangeLounge on LiveJournal.
3256285	3259748	And if you join it, you get some of the latest announcements on what's going on in the station.
3260068	3265552	Sometimes we propose ideas for changes to the station on our LiveJournal and we get your feedback there.
3265632	3267193	So it's just a nice little community.
3267453	3269875	It's a way for you to meet other listeners of OrangeLounge Radio.
3270695	3271596	Crazy people like us.
3273718	3274079	Let's see.
3274539	3275340	DDR Ultramix 2.
3276101	3278884	It's been a game we've been talking about a hell of a lot lately, I gotta say.
3278944	3281947	But SongPack... I keep calling it Service Pack.
3282327	3284129	SongPack 7 came out this week.
3284189	3284650	Finally...
3285134	3290759	A lot of us were expecting that SongPack 7 was going to be out when the game came out, but for whatever reason there was a delay.
3291140	3294023	Sounds like there might have been some kind of bug that prevented things.
3294143	3294463	I don't know.
3295004	3299288	A lot of people bitchin' and moanin' because SongPack 7 has a lot of old songs in it.
3299308	3300969	We were talking about this a little bit last week.
3301730	3305714	But SongPack 7 has End of the Century and Lost in Eurita and Silent Hill.
3306375	3309277	A lot of old classic DDR songs.
3310018	3312298	But I guess played out to a lot of people as well.
3312619	3313219	Era as well.
3313479	3317419	So you get some tack finally in DDR Ultimate Mix 2.
3319000	3321360	But a lot of these songs, since they're old, they're kind of played out.
3321400	3325061	So they're getting a lot of kind of negative feedback from folks out there.
3325141	3329262	Even though, I don't know, I think it's kind of neat because A, you get them 60 frames a second.
3329382	3331422	B, you can play them on Xbox Live now.
3331862	3334382	Not that I'm a huge fan of any of the songs really.
3334602	3336103	I like Era, don't get me wrong, I love Era.
3336703	3336783	Um...
3338103	3345327	But then there's this new remix of I Feel, the Junk Circuit mix, which is pretty interesting because Junk Circuit is another artist that's over on a different drum.
3345367	3348808	The background for this song has the website address.
3349129	3357353	You may have noticed a lot of the different drum songs, like the Jesper Kidd, a lot of the new songs in Ultramix 2 have websites in their backgrounds.
3357373	3359814	So it's kind of interesting that we're getting those in some of the song packs as well.
3361114	3361415	But...
3362735	3374042	I think in visiting Junk Circuit's website, I think there's actually a lot in common between Junk Circuit and Nuropa, who does the song Standing Still in Time, because they have the same website contact email.
3374082	3375403	So, kind of interesting.
3376043	3376303	Alright.
3377364	3377644	Anyway.
3378505	3382067	They're telling us in the chatroom to stop talking about the song and play the damn thing already.
3382107	3382567	That's fine.
3382587	3383147	We'll get to it.
3383227	3384568	I'm going to copy it over right now.
3385008	3388450	Loki's put the finishing touches on it, so we'll go ahead and play that for you.
3388791	3390912	But really first, Loki, what did you think of this remix?
3391949	3396053	I do like this one a little bit better too, but I kind of like the old one as well.
3396073	3396554	I gotta admit.
3396874	3397194	I don't know.
3397215	3398015	What do I know?
3398035	3398196	Alright.
3398376	3399177	I gotta copy it over.
3416041	3419082	I guess there was a big tournament on Ultramix 2 tonight, online.
3419622	3421543	There was a lot of people talking about it over on DDR Freak.
3421723	3422303	I missed it.
3423003	3427564	It wasn't something... I knew I'd get my ass kicked, so I didn't want to participate, but I guess it went pretty well from what I hear.
3428484	3430685	Alright, I'll stop talking and start playing.
3430745	3431425	Here it is.
3431825	3434606	Orange Launch Radio presents the brand new I Feel remix.
3434666	3435806	It's the Junk Circuit mix.
3436007	3436487	Enjoy, guys.
3437227	3441848	Do you feel it?
3442628	3443048	DarkSakura?
3443089	3443709	Who did that again?
3443729	3444749	That was Junk Circuit.
3445516	3447339	Um, I like the original better.
3447900	3450765	I think a lot of us can agree that the original is a little bit better.
3450825	3452067	Nothing ever tops the original.
3452087	3453509	It's like when you remake old movies.
3454410	3455973	Oh, Loki says it does top the original.
3456253	3457155	Well, I disagree!
3458055	3459196	Nothing tops the Kiryamoga.
3459716	3460656	What'd you think of that, Bradley?
3460696	3465379	I liked it, except I think that the... I feel that little... Hold the bottom of the mic here.
3465579	3466319	It's breaking up a little bit.
3466339	3466899	The cord's loose.
3467260	3467580	That's alright.
3467600	3468140	We're ghetto here.
3468160	3469081	We don't have good equipment.
3469901	3471022	Oh, now you're cutting out completely.
3472182	3472522	There you are.
3472682	3472963	Am I here?
3473103	3473703	Yes, you're here.
3474103	3474303	No.
3474483	3475224	Now you're gone again!
3478886	3479046	Nope.
3480126	3481387	We need to buy a new mic, I think.
3481427	3481967	Something's going on.
3482467	3483588	Steal this one real fast.
3485270	3486991	Yo, that one's dying.
3488491	3489632	I cried for that microphone.
3491032	3492573	There we go, try that one.
3492853	3494354	Yeah, that was pretty good.
3494934	3499856	Except for, I think, that little computer I feel it voices is a bad touch.
3500716	3502157	If they left it out, it would make it better.
3502677	3504017	Jazz in our chatroom agrees with you.
3504057	3507958	He says the whole, can you feel it, samples just sounds fucking cheesy, is what he says.
3508419	3508639	Yeah.
3509219	3511219	And Jamie's yelling from the laundry room that she agrees.
3512600	3513460	So overall, I like it.
3514140	3515380	Yeah, I think it's pretty good.
3515761	3521882	I think the, can you feel it, is a little weird, but it, I don't know, it's different.
3522502	3523843	I give him points for trying.
3523903	3525343	It's a good remix.
3525403	3526363	It's a fun song to play.
3528264	3529184	The steps are kind of interesting.
3529204	3531645	It took something good and added a bunch of extraneous crap to it.
3533257	3535779	Is there any DDR remix that you've liked so far?
3537520	3541382	I liked the What's-His-Face one that you interviewed last week.
3541402	3541823	MidiHead?
3542043	3542343	Yeah.
3542443	3542723	Okay.
3542743	3544004	That one was good.
3544464	3544764	Alright.
3546145	3546906	Yeah, What's-His-Face.
3548767	3549627	I wasn't here!
3552749	3553711	I wasn't here!
3571292	3574454	There's a little sticky announcement thingy where you can ask me to hit a question.
3574474	3582959	So if you missed getting your question last week, because we took some questions from our listeners, but if you missed your chance to ask me to hit a question, they are taking question submissions right now.
3583019	3584580	So go check that out if you'd like.
3584960	3586261	What did you think of that remix, Angel?
3586581	3589042	You like everything, so I know you're going to have something good to say about it.
3590763	3596367	Well, I liked the first one from Silent Hill when we first did that one.
3596987	3598588	Then when the other one came out, I liked that one.
3598628	3600469	So what do you think my answer is going to be this time?
3601348	3601668	Come on.
3602588	3603029	What do you think?
3603809	3604089	Ten?
3604709	3604949	Yeah.
3606370	3607390	You're such a Bobani whore.
3607470	3607850	I love it.
3611352	3611752	What?
3613252	3614253	You called her a whore.
3615872	3617354	You make it sound like it's the first time.
3617434	3617735	Come on.
3618396	3618716	All right.
3620699	3622861	I want to take some calls on the Skype line.
3622882	3627888	If you want to give us a call, head on over to www.OrangeLaunchRadio.com and click on Interact With Us.
3628269	3633756	I'm kind of curious about some of your guys' feedback on Ultra Mix 2, specifically Song Pack 7, if you've had a chance to check it out.
3634276	3649127	Any online experiences you might have had on Ultramix 2, and even if you want to talk about a DDR Festival, because we haven't talked a whole lot about DDR Festival, and that's just because none of us in Sacramento, I don't think a single person in Sacramento that I know of anyway has bought the game, so we don't know what to say about it.
3650028	3652870	And to add to that, if you'd like to talk about Drawn Together as well.
3654151	3654952	No, that's not...
3659176	3661898	I have an opinion.
3661918	3662279	No, I don't.
3664020	3664400	Shut up.
3666262	3668083	Did you ever get a chance to play Ultramix 2, Jamie?
3668143	3669945	Did you guys pick that up at your place yet?
3670285	3670565	No.
3670805	3670965	No.
3671045	3671646	Are you going to get it?
3673757	3674218	It's fun.
3674498	3675479	Dot, dot, dot.
3675519	3676220	It's fun!
3676981	3677402	Maybe.
3677682	3678143	You should.
3678363	3681507	The house has been rearranged in Halo 2 land position.
3682568	3685032	I have no room to put any dance pads or anything.
3685953	3686854	Look at this place!
3687094	3688196	Hello, you can sit on our camp.
3688216	3689277	You have infinitely more room.
3689337	3689918	Dan's got the...
3691454	3698699	Normally in my living room we have the TV on one wall, the couch on one wall, and the loveseat back on the far wall.
3699379	3706984	Well now the loveseat and couch are back to back with just enough room to have a place to put your legs and an Xbox between TVs.
3707945	3709486	It is currently in LAN mode.
3710086	3713408	Are you guys hosting a bunch of Halo 2 parties or something?
3713428	3715049	Dan did on his birthday on Monday.
3715270	3716370	Oh, his birthday was Monday, huh?
3716390	3716670	Yeah.
3716750	3717451	Happy birthday, Dan.
3718326	3719306	I wasn't here for that.
3720127	3721427	He told me I should feel guilty.
3722668	3723568	Oh, now that's not true.
3726129	3726669	That's not true.
3730171	3732912	Well, I don't think anybody's calling us on the Skype line, so what can we do?
3733592	3734512	Damn it, they suck!
3734552	3737534	Except now they're talking about drawn together in our chat room.
3737994	3739654	You freaking ass, Loki.
3740695	3741015	Jerk.
3742273	3749517	Loki, now you keep telling me that you're going to start playing Ultramix 2 because I notice that every time I've been playing it, you're like, yeah, I need to play that.
3750377	3751558	Yeah, I need to play that.
3752158	3753139	Are you actually going to be playing?
3753199	3754399	Oh, we're finally getting a call.
3755140	3759842	You're going to reprieve for now, but as soon as this call is done, we're going to ask you about that.
3760142	3761483	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3763024	3763904	Legend of Zaku here.
3764164	3764765	Hi, Zaku.
3764825	3765165	How are you?
3765908	3770790	I don't have that much to share because, you know, as I said, you know, I'm a college student.
3770830	3771790	Then get off the phone!
3772550	3774471	I don't have a PS2 or an Xbox.
3774531	3778253	I might get one this Christmas, but I'm kind of iffy on which one should I get.
3778933	3780173	You know, Bomani-wise, that is.
3780273	3782014	So you don't have a PS2 or an Xbox.
3782034	3786136	So you're asking the age-old question, which system should I get?
3786416	3790357	No, but with regards to not only, you know, games, but also Bomani as well.
3791738	3792758	I'm adding a little kick to that.
3796875	3799217	And you have nothing to add about Drawn Together.
3815123	3816964	Something that's going to remind you of the arcade.
3817164	3819804	Something that's going to bring the arcade experience to the home.
3820164	3822365	Something where there's a lot of different songs available.
3822745	3825386	Something with iToy support if you want to get your hands involved.
3825706	3826466	Go for the PS2.
3827507	3834009	If you want to get something where you can play online and you want to play against other people that live around, go for the Xbox.
3834089	3834729	But here's the thing.
3834989	3839950	You being the starving college student, that means you're going to have to pay for the Xbox, Xbox Live, and then five bucks a song pack.
3840270	3842451	So, I don't know.
3843361	3846242	Yeah, but also with the PS2 I might have to mod it
3847011	3851234	I have to mod if I'm going to play 2DX or any of those lovely Pomani games besides DDR.
3851314	3855896	Well, that's very true, and that's going to cost you money as well, I mean, if you want to play the Japanese game.
3856237	3863941	And that's the other thing, if you plan on modding your PS2, which, you know, can have mixed results, I guess I hear now it's pretty easy to mod it.
3863981	3864842	I live in the city.
3864862	3865002	Right.
3865042	3865822	I live in the city.
3865902	3868224	Chinatown's not that far, and I can always get it modded there.
3868264	3868784	Alright, alright.
3869144	3869505	Fair enough.
3869565	3870685	So you can get a modded PS2.
3870725	3874708	So if you're interested in 2DX or Poppin' or any of that stuff, you're definitely going to want to get the PS2.
3876050	3877251	Here's the other thing to consider, too.
3879092	3883954	We have PS3 and Xbox 2 likely to be out in stores before next Christmas.
3883974	3894660	We don't know for sure, but if I were a betting man, I would say those things are going to be in stores next Christmas, which means the systems that are out there now, their prices will be halved, or they'll be $100 or less.
3896521	3908405	Yeah, I probably already took notice of that, and I think 9th style, if it does come out next year for PS2, I don't know if it's going to jump into the next console, it'll just be the last PS2 2DX game.
3908625	3913327	I'm kind of hoping that there is a 9th style and a 10th style pretty back-to-back.
3913427	3916588	I'm kind of hoping that those games come out pretty quickly.
3916708	3919649	PS2, or just one for PS2 and the next for PS3?
3920150	3920670	I hope they both...
3921890	3928473	I think it's given that PS3 will play PS2 games, so they ought to just both come out for PS2.
3929214	3937798	Yeah, seeing as, you know, I already noticed that 2DX games come out, you know, there's always 2DX games coming out for PS2 every single year.
3938538	3945501	And basically, from what I'm speculating, from what I'm predicting, Night Style might come out in May next year or something, or near the summer.
3945741	3946162	Who knows?
3947222	3947882	Nobody really knows.
3947902	3949123	I'm just taking a guess here.
3949143	3949663	Yeah, taking a shot.
3949683	3950864	I'm just taking an educated guess from...
3952455	3956037	But, you know, alright, I think pretty much I... Well, you know what?
3956557	3966263	Then again, 9th style would make a lot of sense on PlayStation 3 because then they could fuck up the timing by putting it on a new system, just like the arcade ones.
3966843	3976208	And if I get a PS2 for Bomani, I'm going to have to pay money for the 2DX controller, poppin' music, so it's going to be equally the same if I'm going to have to try going after both.
3977042	3983583	because one will have more peripherals and the other will have more services and things to buy.
3983803	3989124	Now, also to even confuse things even more, there's also the Phantom console that's coming out.
3991205	3991965	How is that confusing?
3992145	3993845	Who gives a shit about the Phantom?
3993925	3994485	Seriously.
3995645	3996125	What's that?
3997986	3999266	Exactly, exactly.
3999486	4002106	Hey, I've got pictures of them on orangeonradio.com.
4002567	4003187	And I hear rumors of a...
4005965	4007566	Engage2, that's shaped like a banana.
4008726	4011267	I have rumors.
4011527	4013268	I've heard rumors about foul women.
4013308	4015048	I'm about to have after this show.
4018509	4019430	Here's the thing, though.
4019490	4022211	If you're looking for a system for Bomani, don't get a GameCube.
4023311	4023771	GameCube?
4023811	4024372	Of course not.
4024432	4024892	Hell no.
4024912	4026172	GameCube's not worth the money.
4026292	4026812	That's the best.
4026952	4029013	Hey, don't you be knocking the GameCube.
4029053	4029874	It's a beautiful system.
4029894	4030754	I'm not knocking the GameCube.
4031374	4035578	I mean, it's cheap, but I mean... Don't make me come out there and cut you, because I will.
4035718	4035919	What?
4036019	4037700	You're going to travel 3,000 miles?
4037740	4038321	To cut you?
4038541	4039442	To cut you, yes.
4039983	4043086	Do you even know where in New York do I live?
4043126	4044127	I'll send my minions.
4045068	4045869	Yeah, sure.
4046529	4048671	And then, do you want a cookie for that, Scott?
4049112	4050493	We can track your IP!
4050833	4051294	That's right.
4051794	4053036	Yeah.
4053236	4055358	Live365 has it all on record, I think.
4056072	4057533	Thank you for watching!
4081468	4082570	Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match
4095990	4100856	I've been perusing some of the message forums out there lately, DDR Freak namely being one of them.
4101217	4104741	I thought there was this very interesting thread over there in Random Chat.
4104761	4107585	You know how they do a lot of really crazy stuff over in Random Chat?
4107885	4109387	You know the Random Chat stuff, right?
4109647	4110668	Right, DarkSakura?
4111149	4112230	Being a mod over there and everything?
4114633	4114834	Yes.
4115414	4117755	What's this random that you talk about?
4118835	4120615	We don't know anything about random on this show.
4121675	4132718	Just out of curiosity, this is total tangent, but since I'm thinking DarkSakura here and how much she loves to lock topics over there, what would you say would be the most favorite topic you've gotten to lock on random chat?
4135498	4136639	Hi, please lock this.
4138339	4138659	Yes.
4140280	4141940	I've had a please lock this before.
4147875	4152537	There's an interesting topic going on there in random chats called, do you actually play DDR anymore?
4153157	4158120	And I thought it was kind of interesting just seeing how many people actually don't play DDR anymore.
4158461	4163904	So I kind of was going to go around the room a little bit and see, do you play DDR anymore?
4164824	4167746	And if not, why are you doing this show?
4170207	4170728	I'll start.
4171329	4172331	Do I play DDR anymore?
4172451	4174333	A little bit, not as much nearly as I used to.
4174534	4176457	I play a little bit of Ultramix 2 at home.
4176997	4179040	Most of my DDR playing is controller controller.
4179982	4184749	The reason why I don't play DDR that much anymore is because the quality of arcades in this area went downhill significantly.
4185750	4189452	Kenami of Japan can suck it for not putting out a new mix in a long time.
4189492	4193015	I think that has a lot to do with the reason why I haven't played DDR in a long time.
4194396	4201301	The home version is the only thing keeping it alive to me, but I just can't motivate my fat ass to pull out the ignition pad.
4202021	4205583	As good of a dance pad as it is, it's still not the arcade.
4206083	4210246	I want to play DDR in the arcade, and there's no good arcade mix.
4210446	4215628	And yes, I realize there was that Stepmania thing, but to me, it's still only 90%.
4217009	4219050	And the damn thing broke in a week anyway.
4219290	4221412	And it's still not everything that DDR is.
4221472	4222252	It's still got issues.
4222772	4226494	And in the groove, it's okay, but...
4228155	4231497	Yeah, just, you know, ego killed the video game star, I guess.
4233218	4235140	DarkSakura, do you play DDR anymore?
4235940	4237561	I played DDR when I was in Alabama.
4238522	4239142	Well, there you go.
4239703	4241464	Do you play it regularly besides that?
4241564	4243425	When I'm somewhere that has a machine, I'll play.
4245086	4248188	I've got more reason to play now than I go play dock at RVGL.
4249449	4251471	Because I'll still have a little bit of money and go play some DDR.
4252310	4258776	I played like one game of DDR when I went to go play Doc at Derby Owner's Club over at Roseville Golf Land, but here's the problem, I fucking failed Breakdown!
4258956	4272649	Now, you know, it's a 9-footer, it's a more difficult song at the end of the scale, but you have to remember, I'm somebody who was playing DDR religiously for quite some time, and, you know, I... I just... It just makes me sad how much stamina I've lost, you know?
4273891	4274211	Alright.
4274591	4276373	Arcadian, do you actually play DDR anymore?
4278041	4284563	Not really, just mainly because my foot's been hurting, and because I haven't had that much money lately.
4285343	4290525	Now I might be able to go once my foot feels 100%, or 90% at least.
4291646	4297387	Maybe more in the future, because it's been so long and I need to get off my fat ass when I sit around too much.
4301049	4302689	Loki, do you play DDR anymore?
4303770	4304850	DDR and Final Fantasy XI?
4307991	4313134	Um, yes I do, I'm Step Mania every once in a while, I'll play it.
4313975	4325422	Um, but yes, to answer your question earlier, um, about you, you know, Xbox and stuff and if I was ever going to play it, no, because I'm going to actually set up my Step Mania cabinet to be playing some stuff.
4325462	4331326	In fact, that's why I bought crap today to cut the other, um, control panel for the actual, you know, select arrows and stuff.
4331946	4334748	That's why, um, I was going to do that today.
4334768	4336529	I'm hopefully going to build that this week because I bought...
4337089	4343832	A while back, a new IPAC thing to hook it all up, and I have to see if it's going to get fried as easy as the other one.
4344412	4349014	So, it's all contingent on that, whether I get to play it some more.
4349254	4358958	I don't play in the arcade, because the arcade's too far away, takes too much of my time, cuts into my Final Fantasy XI time, and the arcade's broken all the time.
4360298	4361639	Not in a way fucking out of shape.
4361779	4364741	I go and play like a seven footer on doubles and I'm ready to die.
4365442	4367263	I mean, whatever happened to me.
4368243	4368964	That's what I want to know.
4369384	4370345	It never used to be this hard.
4370925	4373507	But once I get back in shape, yeah, I'd play a lot more.
4373527	4379951	I just need to finish my arcade cabinets before I move out of here, so that's priority one.
4382757	4390999	You don't play a whole lot of DDR in the arcade or at home anymore, yet you're very gung-ho about this cabinet and everything.
4391079	4391919	Why do you think that is?
4391979	4395180	Is it just a love for the basic concept of the game?
4395200	4397921	I like building stuff, have you noticed?
4398221	4399081	Stuff that doesn't work.
4400021	4401122	Like the portal to hell.
4401342	4402142	The portal to hell.
4403863	4407626	Also, I noticed you tend to build things halfway through and don't finish them.
4407966	4415131	Such as these lovely metal pads that have been sitting over here for the past... Can we play Xbox or PS2 games with them right now?
4416572	4423197	We can if I hooked up the other... the, um... iPad thing, because all I have to do is switch out the old iPad and it plugs right in and it works.
4423677	4424318	But the thing is...
4425078	4432744	The thing is, I haven't bought the adapter for the Xbox or the PS2 yet because it was hooking up directly to my computer.
4434326	4435186	But yes, I could.
4435407	4436468	I could if I wanted to.
4436548	4438809	It just would take a while because I'd have to wire everything.
4440451	4446256	But it's just that those things, I would be curious how thick the layer of dust is on those metal pads that are sitting right there.
4447316	4450419	Can I go wipe my finger on it and see how much dust is on them?
4452301	4452741	Here you go, Loki.
4455410	4457851	They also buy the air intake, just so you know.
4463853	4465554	Oh yeah, okay, I have an idea.
4465794	4470856	Let me wipe the dust off of my little, my computer desk here, because I get quite a bit used to it.
4470996	4471717	Oh, like it's gray.
4471997	4475238	Let me wipe the dust off of every, there's dust everywhere in here.
4475678	4477899	It's not a surprise that there's dust on those.
4479480	4485182	That and they're right next to the air intake, which I'm sure is not good for the air conditioner one bit, but that's all right.
4487130	4489171	No wonder it smells like wood in this house all the time.
4489211	4491312	This strange mix of metal and everything.
4491973	4493754	Alright, uh, Explicit.
4493994	4494954	Welcome to the show, by the way.
4495014	4496155	I noticed you just ran in there.
4496455	4497436	Put down the DS for a minute.
4497476	4498296	Quit chatting with Angel on.
4498316	4499077	Take a chat for a minute.
4499757	4501138	That mic's been giving us... Yeah.
4501638	4503479	They are like, what, eight feet?
4504439	4505160	What the hell?
4505500	4509302	This is what... I think they're exchanging special pictures.
4509482	4510583	This is wrong, people.
4510603	4512724	You need to talk.
4513683	4518406	Talky Talky, just like, you know, the people IMing each other when they're sitting in a cafe.
4518806	4519106	Talk.
4520687	4523229	They're riding a penis back and forth to each other.
4523309	4523949	Okay, okay.
4524629	4525890	No, Rob, that's you last night.
4525930	4526330	Thank you.
4526691	4527271	Thank you.
4527631	4530193	You gotta hold the mic at the bottom, because it's going out tonight.
4530373	4531393	That mic's on its last legs.
4531413	4532034	Can you hear me now?
4532054	4532894	Yes, I can hear you now.
4532914	4533595	Do you play DDR?
4534215	4540619	Well, just as an internment and stuff, and if some new people want me to come back again, I guess I'll play again.
4542456	4549281	Well, even though the DDR scene is dying in a way, because there hasn't been any releases for the arcades and stuff, it's totally understandable.
4550723	4557748	But it's just the new people, the community, the new members are just trying to bring it back again in a way.
4557768	4559769	You give me $100,000, I'll bring back DDR.
4560350	4560870	I'm telling you.
4560930	4564433	The only way that you can bring back DDR is by fixing the Sanmenia cabinet, dammit.
4564453	4565614	I like that cabinet.
4565834	4566234	You give me $100,000...
4567759	4570380	Hell, give me just $20,000 and I'll bring it back.
4571240	4577702	Don't you think that, now call me crazy because it's not supposed to be DDR, quote unquote, don't you think In The Groove was sort of a way to try to bring DDR back?
4578283	4581604	That's why I always got the impression that In The Groove was, even though it's not DDR.
4583844	4587906	Well, the thing about In The Groove is that not many cabinets have been sold around the U.S.
4587966	4588386	just yet.
4589511	4594377	And very few songs are in it, mainly just testing the waters until the Groove 2 comes out and stuff.
4595859	4600625	And it also depends on who, what set makers are they gonna hire and what songs they're gonna put in it.
4603329	4607113	Hell, if they put Ultra Mix, like Ultra Mix in the DDR Cam and I play it...
4609354	4612196	The first week after Ultramix 2 is out, I put the call out on this show.
4612216	4616098	I said, we need to hound the shit out of Konami of Hawaii and however it has to happen.
4616218	4620340	I don't care if some arcade division went under or what the shit happened.
4620680	4622041	I don't care how it has to happen.
4622181	4623101	It just needs to happen.
4623361	4624782	Hawaii needs to make a new arcade mix.
4625182	4625743	End of story.
4626123	4628764	I don't care who's got to be blown, who's got to be paid the money.
4629284	4630085	Make it happen.
4630685	4632326	You know what's hella funny, though?
4632926	4636168	That hella companies are saying that the whole arcade business is dying.
4636584	4637045	I have no cards.
4656704	4661368	You know, that's just like people saying, oh, well, you know, internet's killing the telephones.
4662509	4665011	People still use the telephones, just like people use the internet.
4665331	4668113	Yes, people still use the telephone, and I talk to them.
4668373	4668673	Sorry.
4669034	4675479	Anyway, but the whole thing is, is the convert, you know, Ultramix to an arcade system is like fucking easy.
4675939	4678101	Minimal programming, licensing of songs.
4679142	4679862	Build the hardware.
4680022	4681363	Hardware's fucking easy to build.
4681403	4682864	I mean, come on.
4682925	4685607	It's just an excuse, but I just don't want to do it.
4686167	4687793	Because they don't want to distribute it, and that's a bitch.
4687993	4692367	The reason why I pump it up is by making more and more money just building new machines and stuff.
4694651	4702355	Allow me to be the first to offer sex to anyone at Konami of Hawaii if you can make yourselves a new DDR game.
4702775	4703676	You know what?
4703916	4706377	Not that Konami of Japan does a bad job.
4706437	4709559	So if they want to do a new mix, I'm perfectly fine with that as well.
4710019	4715082	I will extend my sex offer to Konami of Tokyo as well, K-Set.
4715622	4718043	So just make me a new DDR and I will put out.
4718143	4718764	It's that simple.
4719524	4722926	Anybody else care to offer their sexual favors?
4725354	4728156	You know, this is what's pissing me off.
4728176	4732139	They're like, oh, this is too expensive to license songs here in America.
4732379	4733580	That's why we can't do it.
4733861	4734841	Do all in-house music.
4734861	4738884	You have, like, what, five different series to pull from?
4738944	4740365	Do what you've been doing for years.
4740526	4743408	License the song in Japan and then let the machines come over here.
4743868	4745209	That's what they've been doing for years.
4746530	4749152	Because it's cheaper to license the songs in Japan, obviously.
4749693	4766509	I look a little weird, but like, I made this machine over here in Japan, it's called a DDR Stream USA, but it's not meant to be played in the United States, just... They could call it DDR Shit Mix, and I'd still play it.
4767190	4768151	I'm sorry, Shitake.
4769032	4772175	They could call it DDR Shitake Mix, I would still play it.
4772195	4773016	Shitake, that's all.
4776274	4779121	Angel, you still play DDR at all?
4779522	4782650	You're probably more into DDR than anyone I know right now, so I have to ask you this.
4783783	4791106	Oh yeah, in fact, I'm probably going to break down and get a dual platform Ignition because I want to play on Xbox Live.
4791706	4799770	So, yeah, I'm looking into getting both of those this week, Ultramix 2 and the new pad.
4800470	4804071	Because Magus isn't dying anyway, so might as well just replace it.
4804092	4806212	Then we can play doubles and stuff.
4806472	4807113	That's cool.
4807133	4809734	Speaking of doubles, which is better, Ignition or Carameldansen?
4811465	4813446	I couldn't tell you because I haven't really played enough Cobalt Flux.
4813486	4816727	I saw it a little bit at E3, but it wasn't familiar enough with it.
4817207	4818827	They're both the same fucking pad!
4819168	4821088	It's the same damn thing with a different logo on it.
4821128	4821728	That's all it is.
4822088	4823129	You can't get much different.
4823429	4825430	Oh, our metal is different than your metal!
4826230	4827210	What about the quality?
4827670	4830351	What about the quality and how many times could it be stepped?
4830711	4831592	It doesn't matter.
4831612	4832732	They're the fucking same.
4833598	4836819	The gold flood said not even a rhino could beat down the pad.
4837079	4837379	Oh yeah!
4837859	4839419	Do they have a rhino to test this?
4839620	4843100	Did they take it to Africa and go, hey rhino, step on the pad!
4843320	4844121	How do you like it?
4844581	4845381	I mean, I'm sorry.
4845621	4846861	So I can say, yeah, guess what?
4847041	4848962	Jupiter has nothing on this pad.
4849542	4851182	This pad can fuck up Jupiter.
4852543	4855243	Seriously, they're just pulling shit out of their ass, okay?
4855323	4856884	A rhino can't fuck this up.
4857064	4857704	Oh, well, guess what?
4857744	4861145	Bigfoot recommends, you know, red octane, so fuck that.
4862814	4863374	It's stupid.
4863575	4867398	Really, to be honest, when it comes down to pads, don't buy off the internet.
4867998	4869339	Buy stuff that you can see at a store.
4869379	4871861	Buy it like fries and stuff where you can actually see these pads.
4871881	4879788	Because the shit you get off the internet, because I have bought metal pads off the internet, and I stepped on them and they bent.
4880528	4881569	They bent downwards.
4882050	4883291	And I was like, what the fuck?
4884372	4885112	It was retarded.
4885813	4888435	Pads are not meant to be folded in half.
4889195	4893817	Wow, talk about how they say SEVs can't bust them on their advertisements.
4894097	4897159	Our chatroom over at www.orangeloungeradio.com, clicking on chat.
4897439	4903641	Interesting point, there already is a DDR shit mix, and it's the Don't Fall Off mix, the DDR Extreme bootleg.
4904062	4905142	You know the one that would speed up?
4905322	4906103	Oh, I see there's two of them.
4906123	4908043	Yeah, I know about the speed up.
4908184	4909524	DDR Extreme Plus, thank you.
4909644	4912365	Yeah, the one in Country Club Lane, speed up.
4912565	4915167	Oh, let's speed up Max 300 and see if we can beat it at 360 BPM.
4915227	4915847	Oh, wow.
4919373	4922136	or hear cartoon heroes in a very high-pitched voice.
4936793	4938494	What is the deal with Cartoon Heroes?
4938895	4945879	Why do so many people freaking love that song and are quick to label a mix as utter shit if that song isn't in it?
4946359	4947980	I don't understand what is so great about the song.
4948080	4948741	Is it a good song?
4949021	4949901	Yeah, it's a great song.
4949941	4951102	It was a little better when Aqua did it.
4951362	4952203	But it's a good song.
4952723	4953544	Is it fun to play?
4954184	4956687	Kinda, I mean, I'll die when I play it.
4956767	4960570	But why do so many people freaking obsess over Cartoon Heroes?
4960810	4964633	Like, do you know how many people threw a fit when that song was in Extreme USA?
4966234	4973701	Let's look back in DDR history and view what we call the songs that ruin mixes.
4974261	4975122	Starting with...
4975782	4977443	Third mix, Afronova.
4977964	4983067	Who could love this wonderful African shent as you jump around like a complete nut?
4983848	4989311	Fourth mix, Kick the Can, with its repetitive steps over and over and over again.
4990092	4991553	There's another contributing factor.
4992654	4991553	1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 0, 7.
4997117	5000919	You're forgetting, though, my edit to Kick the Can, a.k.a.
5001000	5004362	Big Cans, was awesome and made that song redeemable.
5006092	5009313	Okay, as I would continue on, the fifth mix, Hot Limits.
5009813	5013575	The song that's just, you don't understand what they're saying, but you know it's very long.
5016696	5023018	Anyways, DDR Max, I'd say probably that would be Exotic Ethnic.
5023238	5025238	It was pretty repetitive in DDR Max.
5025579	5026659	Oh no, Flash in the Night.
5026859	5028299	Yeah, that was another one.
5028380	5032041	Flash in the Night.
5032161	5033561	Hold on, your mic's still cutting out a little bit.
5033621	5034322	Hold it at the bottom.
5034462	5035222	I want to bring out the...
5037405	5037786	A little bit.
5037826	5038366	Hold it at the bottom.
5039447	5040187	Yeah, try it, try it.
5040428	5041388	Put it close to the bottom.
5041529	5042229	There you go.
5042369	5047694	The same reason why Cartoon Heroes got poured out is the same reason why So Deep is getting poured off with DDR Max.
5047914	5049315	Because it's like hard as hell 9.
5050096	5055920	I would say the song that ruined DDR Max, even though I love this song, Cowgirl.
5056881	5057562	Cowgirl, yes.
5058442	5063947	Max 2, Cigarro, and who could not forget the song that had everyone dancing...
5065662	5070024	I hate cartoon heroes and I know there's
