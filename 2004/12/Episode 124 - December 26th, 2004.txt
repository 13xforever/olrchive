Oh, God.
Call me Daddy.
Orange Lounge may contain adult content.

Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.
Orange Lounge may contain plenty of... Just kidding.
Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that in this episode.
Well, isn't that special?
Orange Lounge Radio Live is a fully interactive program via our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com And now, here are your hosts for Orange Lounge Radio Live, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
We are live!
And this is episode number 124 for this December the 26th.
2004, you're tuned in to the bee-money scene's most holiday-spirited station of all things rhythm and music, video gaming.
My name is Rob Roberts.
You might know me as Sky.
Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts.
In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm.
You know her better as DarkSakura.
Say hello to Jamie Summers.
So late.
I lied.
She's not here tonight, actually.
Actually, Jamie Summers is a little under the weather tonight.
She's a little sick.
She caught a Christmas bug, an elf bit her in the ass, and now she's sick.
I don't know what happened, but we hope you feel better soon, Miss DarkSakura.
The show must go on.
So joining me as always, say hello to our tech master, Loki.
I have the cheese.
See, you have food, so it's all right.
I was going to cook before the show, but due to our laying off of some extra staff members, we didn't have extra people.
Well, usually, now DarkSakura's the one that comes in here and she brings her big plate of meat and asparagus.
But tonight it's you that's snacking during the show.
You want to do some laundry, too?
Actually, I do need to do laundry.
There you go.
We'll get all the essence of DarkSakura.
We'll make it feel like she's here even though she's not.
I don't have a laptop.
Or homework, thank God.
See, there you go.
I was going to say we had a laptop.
Well, you could play DS.
That would be pretty close.
I'm just kidding.
It's actually not even similar at all.
Also joining us tonight, then, since DarkSakura isn't here, we do have a special guest.
Say hello to DarkChild.
Yo, what's up, what's up?
Life sucks, yo, but fuck it.
Merry Christmas to you too, my friend!
Bah hum fucking bug.
Alright.
Oh goody, we needed a little bit of anger tonight.
Since DarkSakura's not here.
And you know that since she's sick, she's extra angry.
So, you know, we've got all that extra anger right here in a little body we call Dark Child.
Anyway, it should be an interesting show tonight.
I really have no idea what's going to happen.
I notice our listenership is down a little bit, probably because you guys are away for the holidays, doing your holiday thing.
Fine!
See if we care.
You guys have your families and your presents and your eggnog.
Yeah, we don't do it for our listeners now.
We do it for our listeners on our reruns, which on Fridays on DDR Freak.
Catch it.
You're doing so good.
You're learning so well about the cheap plugs.
I love it.
See, that's what they all plan to do now, though, is that now that they know that this reruns on Friday, they're just like, nah, fuck it, I don't need to listen tonight, I can just tune in Friday over on TDR Freak.
Forget Orange Lounge.
That's alright.
Whatever.
Whatever gets us out there and gets us attention, whether it be on Orange Lounge Radio or TDR Freak Radio, who cares?
Because isn't attention whoring what it's really all about?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Alright.
So, whatever.
We'll try and make do anyway.
I'm sure we have a lot of folks who want to talk about their Christmas and want to talk about New Year's coming up.
Want to talk about tsunamis in China.
I don't know.
Fuck all that.
Life sucks.
Or maybe we're just gonna... Let's just have a giant pity party.
Because isn't that what Orange Lounge is all about anyway?
Just feeling sorry for ourselves.
I have cheese.
Alright, we'll be back after this opening with How's Your Week, How's Your Day, and the Monty News and all that other fun stuff.
And this breaks the music from Guitar Freaks.
We'll be back after this.
Join our chatroom, www.orangelearnersradio.com, click on chat, and the Skype line.
You know we're going to be taking lots of calls tonight because, well, we're bored.
We'll be back after this.
Thank you for watching!
Thank you for watching.
See you next time.
Let's go!
Let's go!
Thanks for watching!
I don't know what it is about you that's got me feeling mesmerized I won't let you get away, boy, you're the lucky one
DarkSakura.com
Hello?
Hello?
Is this thing on?
Testing?
Testing 1, 2...
I'm looking in the index, but I don't see anything for how to run a radio show.
Hello?
I don't understand this.
Does this thing work?
This thing reads like stereo instructions.
Is this on?
What the hell?
Orange Lounge Radio.
Broke down Ghetto Bomani Radio.
What the f***?
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
The lovely DarkSakura making an appearance in that promo.
Even though she's out tonight, she's feeling ill.
Yes, she is.
She's in that promo there with that other guy.
We are here on Orange Lounge Radio episode number 124.
I noticed our chat room is just kind of bouncing there, chatting away, talking.
So you can go join him at www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on chat.
And of course, Skype line, which we'll certainly probably have to make some use out of tonight because we have very limited talent here in the studio tonight.
Especially with Jamie being gone, well, there went all the talent, so...
We're really screwed now, so we'll probably be relying on you guys a little bit, but that's alright.
It's good when we get a chance to sit down and talk to our listeners a bit.
Hope all you guys out there had a happy holidays.
It is December 26th.
It's the day after Christmas.
So today is the day that everybody's out at the stores and they're spending their gift certificates and, you know, trying to, you know, spend all their Christmas money and things like that, trying to buy things.
So I hope for those of you that decided to go shopping today, you were able to find those things that you wanted.
I know that we had our own experience over at our local Best Buy, but there's kind of a backstory to this.
You see, basically what happened this week is that, you know, I was playing a little bit of computer games and stuff and I was leaning back in my chair and my fat ass broke my own chair.
So here I was without a chair on Christmas Eve.
Nowhere to go after 6 o'clock on Christmas Eve, so I couldn't replace the chair on Christmas Eve, so I couldn't replace it on Christmas Day.
So my back is starting to hurt after a while.
I could still sit in my chair, but I couldn't lean back.
Like, if I would lean back, I'd fall on the floor.
So I had to wait until today to go out and get a new chair, so I decided to brave Best Buy today.
And Loki said, hey, you know, I'll go too, because, what is it, you got for Christmas, what, like...
I have too many gift cards.
I cannot close my wallet because of all the gift cards.
So I was trying to get rid of the gift cards at Best Buy.
How much money did you have for Best Buy?
$50.
For those who don't know what Best Buy is, I think Best Buy is a nationwide thing, right?
If you don't have one in your neck of the woods, it's basically a huge electronics store.
DVDs, movies, CDs, all that stuff.
Which we really shouldn't name these things by name because they're not paying us advertising dollars.
It's like Circuit City, but blue.
Okay, fair enough.
We're not really endorsing them either.
We're just saying we went there because we had gift certificates and I needed a chair and I knew they sold chairs.
So anyway, went over to Best Buy, and holy crap was the line long at Best Buy.
I mean, it was going, it looked like it was the day before Christmas.
That's how they do the lines now.
It was crazy.
But I mean, it was a long, long line.
It was like, practically, it started to go, it was going back, and it was going like around the corner.
No, they set up a queue now, just like Fry's has.
Right.
Now, I know they don't have Fry's everywhere.
They have it all mostly on the West Coast, but I don't think they have it everywhere.
I don't think so, yeah.
So...
Basically, lines on Best Buy.
So I know a lot of people are out there shopping today.
My fat ass broke that chair, but that's okay.
It was kind of a shitty chair anyway.
It was a $20 Walmart chair.
That's what I get for shopping at Walmart, basically.
So I had to step it up anyway.
I needed to buy a nicer chair.
And I feel, might I say, I feel quite proud of myself because I built this chair.
That's right.
This chair did not come pre-assembled.
So I had to get out the instruction manual, which I'll tell you.
Not written in this country, because they have to draw pictures to make sense of everything.
He first thought the instruction manual was not included until I later found it attached to a chair.
Shut up.
You don't have to bring that shit up, alright?
So finally, we discovered the instruction manual, which was poorly placed inside of the box somewhere.
And I put it together.
I put this whole chair together.
I was very happy.
Oh, Loki helped with one part, but, you know, that doesn't matter.
So, I'm very proud of my handiwork.
I feel like a man today.
I've become a man today.
I've built my own chair.
It was kind of like, you know what?
It was like Legos.
I think that's why we play with Legos as a kid.
Because, you know, I have to follow the Legos as a kid.
or now for some of you guys.
When you're building Legos, they don't tell you how to do it.
You have to follow the little pictures.
That's what it's doing.
It's prepping you for what the real world is going to be like when you have to build these chairs.
If you're ever going to shop at Ikea, basically, you better know how to put Legos together because that's the kind of instructions you're going to have to follow.
I'm very proud of myself for building this chair.
Only one screw is a little loose, so hopefully I'll be okay.
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Basically, here it is.
It's just me, it's just Loki, it's just Dark Child.
We're all ugly, so we don't need to be on the webcam.
Well, I could turn on the webcam, but you'd just have a picture of an empty couch.
Basically, if we were to turn on the webcam, all you would see is the gigantic box that my chair came in.
Which, I don't know how the chair comes in a ginormous box like that and isn't pre-assembled.
and then you see all the wrapping paper and just stuff strewn all about this post-Christmas chaos we have going on but there's nobody sitting over there with a webcam you guys bitch all the time
The webcam angle is horrid.
So maybe we'll move the webcam later.
We'll try to point it over here.
See, it's too big of a pain in the ass.
Because of this cabinet that Loki has, the cabinet of death thing that he's got going on, it's too hard to change.
I have to unlock the little coin door.
I have to go in, I have to turn on the power.
Then I have to switch over the...
Video input to make sure it's a TV, otherwise you get no video.
Then once I do that, then I have to start up the PlayStation 2.
I have to switch over the video to that.
Then I have to start iToyPlay.
Once I get iToyPlay going, then I have to set the iToy in a well-lit area.
So that means I have to adjust the lighting as well.
Thank you.
It's just too much damn work.
And consider we have half the listeners we usually have.
F you.
We're not going to set up the webcam.
No, I'm kidding.
We love you guys who are here tonight on your vacation listening.
Love you.
Just stare hard enough at the webpage.
You'll eventually see us.
Trust me.
You know what?
Here.
This is an excellent opportunity for you to visit our picture galleries.
And you can see... See, this is how you promote.
You cross-promote your other productions.
Loki.
This is...
You visit our picture gallery on the website, and you can see pictures of us at E3, smiling back at you.
And you can see Rice Princess is in there, and Lanky Style, Seagird's in there, Akira Yamaoka is in some of the pictures.
So, you know what, if you're missing the webcam tonight, check out our ugly mugs in the picture gallery.
And yes, for some reason, every single goddamn picture that is taken of me, I squint, and I don't know why.
It's just, I squint.
My eyes are sensitive or something.
Now Misty's offering financial compensation now for you to go through.
I still don't understand why they want a webcam pointed at nothingness, but maybe we could just turn on the TV.
We could just put it on Cartoon Network.
I'll turn on the webcam.
There you go.
God!
We could just point, you know, we could just turn the TV on Cartoon Network.
Or just go sit at the chair.
There you go.
Dark Child, you could just... Take a watch and be sick.
There you go.
You'll just, you can model.
At least they're not requesting nude modeling tonight, be thankful for that.
Ah, fuck it, I'd do it.
You're just in one of those moods.
It's that time of the month.
Oh, ho, ho.
Alright, well, we need to get into a little bit of how was your week, how was your day, where we're going to talk about how our week was and how our day was.
And I know that there was Halloween going on.
Or, Halloween.
It's going to be one of those shows.
You know what, though?
If your house is like my house at all, maybe it felt like Halloween to you.
Because things were a little bit scary.
Yes, you did get death for Christmas from... Who got that?
That was DarkSakura that got that for you.
The death doll, right?
So maybe it was Halloween for some... It feels like Halloween to me.
Trick or treat.
Give me money.
Alright.
Dark Child, we'll start with you, my friend.
Since Jamie usually starts us off and she's not here tonight and you're sort of filling in.
How was your week?
How was your day?
Where to start?
My week was the worst week.
Remember, it's a three hour show.
Yes, yes, I know, I know.
My week was the worst week ever.
I have
Move back home to my mother's house north of Sacramento.
I was hoping to continue changing things for me and Anita to be together, make things better.
You know, guys fuck up and we need to change a lot and it usually takes us a long time to figure it out.
Well, I give back and she no longer wants to be with me.
So, yeah, week sucked.
I spent the rest of the week staying at my mom's house on the ranch doing nothing but writing in a little book and sitting in the trailer since I'm not welcomed in the house.
So you get to ride horsies on the ranch?
No, I'm not allowed to ride the horses.
No horsies?
No horsies.
The dogs at the house get better privileges than I do.
So, yeah, and then Christmas came and my brother comes up with his fiancee, which made life more difficult for me.
And we had the usual
Family Argument, which ended up being resolved by us going outside and smoking some by.
Orange Arms did not support spoken by.
Today.
Today.
And, you know, I had dinner with my family.
You know what, though?
Now that I think about it, it would make this show a lot better.
I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.
Kids, say no to drugs.
Until you're 21.
So yeah, that was my week and my day today.
I hung out with Dream Pixie and her boyfriend and just talked about stuff.
The Orange Lounge, madam.
Where the fuck is she?
She was supposed to be here tonight.
She decided that she wanted to go to Hayward with her man, so... FIRED!
She'll be back Tuesday, though.
Oh, well, great, she can go guest on Jamie's show, because, you know, we don't do a show here on Tuesdays.
Alright, whatever.
I see how it is.
I see how it is.
Deep dickings are more important than Orange Lounge, I understand.
I'm not getting deep dicking here?
Maybe later, if you're good.
Okay.
But, yeah, that was my week and my day.
Alright, well.
Sorry to hear that the holidays were not that exciting, but you know what?
Sometimes that's what the holidays are for, is for us to just... I really don't know where I'm going with this thought.
Feel like shit because you realize that a big fat man in a red coat's not real?
Don't tell... We have children that listen to this show.
Santa is fake, so is the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy.
You're just breaking little kids' dreams everywhere.
Sad.
Although part of me is tempted to go to Golfland and announce that over the loudspeaker.
Attention children, get off my DDR machine.
Santa Claus does not exist.
Okay, now I see Loki with his thinking face over there and I know what he's thinking.
Let me think.
How could I patch in to the Roosevelt Golfland sound speaker system to make all the announcements I want?
No, that's not what I'm thinking.
What I'm thinking is, with the portable PC they'll have, which we'll be able to, you know, record to for E3 and stuff, you could put, like, some external speakers running off the same battery power and turn those up really loud, and it'd be like your own portable boombox system.
That's so... Remember the early 90s?
Remember those old rap videos, you know, where they would carry the boombox on their shoulder, like, you know, with the loud music playing, and it was in all the rap videos and the colorful getup they'd have?
You're almost describing that exact same thing, except now it's like gone totally nerddom, where now you'll have the big PC sitting on your shoulder.
Attention, Golf Land children, there is no Santa Claus.
Enjoy your day.
Your parents have been lying to you for years.
The only reason your parents brought you here is so that they don't have to listen to you for an hour, so they can get some peace and quiet, and possibly do it in the bathroom.
Have a happy holiday!
Ho, ho, ho!
Loki, how was your week and your day?
He's sending the webcam.
Take a break from the webcam.
No, I have to fix webcam.
Anyways, my week and day...
My week was boring.
It was really busy and then it got really dead.
And then we went and saw the Phantom of the Opera.
That was okay.
And I got lots of shirts and gift cards and played lots of Final Fantasy.
Made fried rice.
That's about it.
That fried rice was good, by the way.
It was very good.
Delicious.
You should be an Iron Chef.
Between you and Jamie, I'm set when it comes to this show because I can't cook for shit, but Jamie cooks really well, and Loki cooks really well, and heaven.
I think that should be a requirement to continue being a co-host of the show, is that you should cook for me every week.
And in return, I will bring you my presents.
I brought you Puerto Rican sausage.
I'm vegetarian.
It's okay, you don't have to swallow.
Alright anyway, my week and my day.
My week was pretty unexciting.
I mean, work, and we got off work early.
Did karaoke on Thursday, which was exciting.
Got to stay long enough to see some strippers, which were really ugly, so we decided to leave.
Woo!
Go strippers ugly!
Yeah, they were really ugly, so we left early.
Christmas was okay.
I got money, which is a good thing.
Money's always good.
And I got a really ugly sweater, which, you know, I'm always thankful for that.
Let's see, what else happened?
Oh, I went and saw Phantom of the Opera.
Also at the movie theater because it was playing.
It's tradition in our family that we always go and see a movie on Christmas.
It's like, okay, we eat, then we open all the presents, then we go and we go to a movie.
So we went and saw Phantom of the Opera because that's what my mom wanted to see.
And it was a good movie.
I cried like a little girl and it was a very gay film.
So I was quite pleased with it.
It was good.
I recommend it.
Thumbs up if you want to go see Phantom of the Opera.
Although it was a little long.
It was kind of long.
But I've seen the stage play a couple times.
And there were some things about the stage play.
I don't know if it translated very well to screen.
But overall it was well acted and all that fun stuff.
Oh, you changed the angle of the cam.
I see.
Oh.
Well, great.
Wow, you guys really owe Loki for this one.
He went up there and changed the angle of the cam completely so that you can see us in our little corner.
And you can see what a dump my workstation is.
Oh, well, that's alright.
I don't care.
I build a chair.
Everything else can go to hell.
Alright, so that was pretty much my week and my day.
Yeah.
Anything else exciting happen on your Christmas?
That was it?
You seemed like you were gone a lot this week.
Well, no, I was only gone like a few days.
Like, Christmas Eve, hung out at my parents' house.
Christmas Day, when I hung out at my parents' house because my grandparents were over.
That's pretty much all I did, really.
Oh, I have 100 stars now in Mario 64.
That's a lot of downtime waiting for parties in Final Fantasy.
Now, here we go.
There's an idea for what we could do with the show tonight, because Jamie's not here.
We could just have Final Fantasy XI chat tonight.
I don't play Final Fantasy XI anymore.
You used to.
I don't play any games anymore.
Weren't you playing World of Warcraft for a while there?
Yeah, I was in the beta for like seven months.
Everybody's freaking ditching Final Fantasy XI to go World of Warcraft, but you know what?
Don't.
They're coming back.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, you didn't enjoy World of Warcraft?
I did, but it had problems, and when it came to release time, they still hadn't even worked out putting in talents for some of the classes, and other classes were just still too overly powerful, and other classes didn't do what they were supposed to do, and then somehow it went gold, so it's going to be like Star Wars Galaxy all over again, one year of paid beta.
Alright, fair enough, and welcome to your opinion.
So yeah, Final Fantasy XI chat.
No, I'm kidding.
Actually, but you were saying something which I thought was kind of funny.
You said something in chat before the show which I thought was really interesting.
You were typing and you said, I keep wanting to type slash L before I type anything, but only my link shell will hear it.
Now that's the sign of too much Final Fantasy XI.
And not a chat room.
Alright.
Alright, we're going to go to a break, you guys.
When we come back from break, maybe we'll get to some Bomani news.
Maybe we'll take some calls on the Skype line.
I want to hear about your guys' Christmas and how things are going.
So, go ahead and give us a call over there when we come back.
If you don't know what I'm talking about when I say the Skype line, head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on Interact With Us.
We're going to be back after this break of music from 2DX 10th Style.
We're kind of in a year-end show.
This is going to be the last show of the year, if you can believe it, because the next show will be on...
Sorry about that little bit of dead air there, guys.
Sorry about that.
Loki made a klutzy move and he unplugged our soundboard completely.
Do not be alarmed.
Do not be alarmed.
Anyway, yeah, we're getting towards the year-end show here, so we kind of want to start acknowledging those games that came out this year.
We played a lot of songs during the pre-show.
We've got some more songs for you, kind of the best of 2004 here.
All right, we'll be back after this break featuring some music from 2DX10Style.
We'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio after this.
Thanks for watching!
Thank you for watching!
And what I need
Thank you for watching!
Please subscribe to my channel!
I can't believe it's me, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.
Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bomani Music and More program.
Can we talk about that?
No subject will ever be taboo.
Well, I was thinking maybe we should move Pump Up the Volume from Tuesday Nights.
Except, of course, a subject that was just under discussion.
Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?
I collect your fucking head.
Just like this fucker here.
Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki?
The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!
Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!
Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.
Does anyone even know what the holic thing on episode 69 is anymore?
I mean, that was like a year ago.
More than a year ago.
It was about a year and a few months ago.
I know some of our obsessive folks in the chat room know.
The folks that have been listening for forever.
But those of you that haven't been listening very long probably have no idea what they're talking about there.
That's right.
Ask Misty or Angel or one of those folks that would know about it.
Ask one of them to explain it to you.
They'll be kind enough to do so.
Alright.
Anyway, we are here on Orange Lawn Radio.
We do have an interesting circumstance tonight because DarkSakura is not here.
So usually we try to do something a little silly for the cage match when DarkSakura isn't here.
Like we do a reverse cage match, we do the karaoke cage match or something crazy.
Loki's giving me that look of no karaoke cage match.
That's fine.
Are you saying that I can't sing?
Well, okay, I guess Dark Child possibly could sing, but I'm not singing again, and neither is Loki.
Yeah, I can tell by the expression on his face.
So we have to do something a little different with Cage Match Night.
So here it is.
And you guys have been begging for this forever.
So consider this your freaking Christmas present, alright?
Well, we will allow a chat room choice, okay?
So if you have an idea what song you would like to put in tonight's cage match, send me a private message right now with the song you would like to put in tonight's cage match.
And we will pick one at random Now you gotta be prepared, you might have to send me the song So don't name anything you don't have, because you might have to send it to me, okay?
So think about a song, think about it, don't just send the first thing that comes to your mind Think about a song you would like to hear in tonight's cage match Send it to me over private message, Sky in the chatroom And we will have a chatroom choice in tonight's cage match And then, maybe you guys will stop complaining that our choices suck Because one of them will be yours So, there you have it
Does that sound like a fair thing we can do for our listeners?
I think so.
Sounds fair.
I think.
Sounds very fair.
Well, you're song one.
I will pick a new song, and then we will have, instead of DarkSakura, because she's out tonight, we will have the chatroom choice as the third song.
So there you have it.
Because Dark Child doesn't matter.
Well, you matter.
Now, see, you still get to trash all three songs.
Oh, true, true.
So there you go.
So don't worry, Dark Child.
There's still a lot of love for you.
Darkchild, for those that may not know you, you haven't been on the show in a little while.
We're syndicated over on DDR Freak now, which has exposed ourselves to a whole new listener base.
Some folks may not know who you are.
Tell us a little bit about yourself and your DDR history.
I know you go...
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Yeah, Male Penis Golf Land.
And he's like, hey, dude, there's this cool new game that we're testing out here.
Because, you know, Male Penis gets a lot of test stuff.
So he has me go to the Golf Land.
I see DDR.
And my friend Ron gets on.
I'm like, whoa, that game looks like it's tight.
So I try to play it.
I suck.
You know, I was barely able to get past Boom Boom Dollar because, you know, everyone passes heavy, never been mellow.
This was 1.5.
Then it turns out that the guy that's standing there playing with us is a guy named Jim from Konami.
He was in charge of testing it for Konami, so I played with, you know, the original test market here in the U.S.
Wow, okay.
And I got started playing right around the same time as Jason Ko, Mel B, Jahi, you know, all them old scores.
Love the name dropping, love the name dropping.
Yeah, I gotta drop it for him.
and Mike Noe, RTF.
I was also there for the DDR Freak listeners.
I was there when Jason Coe and us came up with the idea for DDRFreak.com.
I've been there from the beginning.
Only SoCal people who played imported DDR could say they've been playing longer than me.
Ooh, oh, whipping out the DDR penis!
Oh, hell yeah.
Showing everyone right now how big it is.
Alright.
So how many years does that make that you've been playing DDR?
When was this?
Is this 98?
That was 98.
Shit.
And I haven't really been playing much anymore.
I've been a big-time judge the past few years.
And I have a big tournament event coming up in September called the Max Games Tournament.
Tell us about it.
It's in September.
In September.
Dang, two ways off.
This is going to be held at the San Jose Tech Museum.
Sorry, I'm holding it too close.
Alright, San Jose Tech Museum.
And DDR will not be the only game there, but I will be running the tournament for DDR.
It will be Perfect Attack and Freestyle, a weekend-long event.
There will also be a Halo 2 tournament, a bunch of other game tournaments on consoles.
Red vs. Blue is going to show up, and we're going to be airing Season 3 and possibly all of the seasons on the IMAX screen located at the Tech Museum.
as well as BrickFlick.com will be having a video that we're creating currently.
I'm a member of BrickFlick and we're going to be making a Lego video for the IMAX screen.
And it's going to be a huge event.
That's why we're planning ahead now for September.
And also at the same time, Tech Museum will have a video game exhibit.
Oh.
So a huge history of video game thing going on at the museum the same weekend.
We want to go.
Hook us up with some media thing.
Of course.
I'll have a couple of VIP passes.
Woo-hoo.
Get three, because there are three hosts here.
All right.
I want to clarify some things, because some folks in our chat room have some questions about the chat room choice for Cage Match tonight.
You know, and you guys have been begging to do this for forever, so I thought you already knew how it worked, but that's fine.
That's fine.
I realize it's been a while, so I'll just remind you guys.
The way the cage match works is that we put three songs into rotation.
Originally, the concept was songs that aren't in a Bomani game that should be or sound like they belong in a Bomani game, but they're not there yet, so, you know, just upbeat, happy dance songs.
But it kind of transformed itself into whatever's cool right now.
We've had all sorts of cage match winners.
We've had Bomani artists win with like Echo Image won before.
We've had Top 40 artists win it.
Gwen Stefani won.
We've had songs from Overclocked in there.
We've had songs that were theme songs to animes and stuff in there.
All sorts of stuff.
So...
Just whatever sounds good to you that you think is going to win it.
I would love anyone who puts Slipknot in there.
Jesus.
Okay, we have to have some jurisdiction over this.
Alright, anyway.
Now that we've clarified that, back to you for a minute.
So, when did you... So you've been playing DDR since 98.
When did you stop?
I stopped playing right around...
I'd say just after Third Mix came out.
Which is about the time I started.
Yeah, it's about the time a lot of people started because that's when it was hitting the U.S.
market.
Right.
I moved up to Wheatland, which is north of Sacramento.
Which is a little...
Nothing whole in the world, yeah.
And, you know, coming from MGL, we still thought, you know, there was no Sakto DDR.
No, and there wasn't at the time, really.
So I didn't really play up here.
When I went down back to the Bay and I was trying 4th style and some of the hard songs on 3rd style, I was way out of my league again.
You know, I saw Orochi sitting there flying, his feet flying all over the board on songs I couldn't even picture the arrows on.
So that's when I kind of stopped playing and started getting invited to judge a bunch of tournaments.
So I've just been a judge since then.
Now, okay, since you're a judge and you've judged a lot of tournaments, this is a good question because we've got a lot of tournaments that have been going on lately coming up.
What kind of shit do you look for in a routine?
What makes a good freestyle DDR routine?
First off, I hate power moves after power move after power move.
If it looks like your routine doesn't flow and you know you could break, so you do breaking here, then there's a little pause and nothing, and then more breaking here, and then a pause and it's just regular dance, then more breaking, it's obvious you're just doing power moves to impress us.
And a lot of judges don't like that.
Another thing, if I've seen you up there before, it's really hard for people like Mel B to impress me, because I've seen a lot of his routines, and I always expect him to do something a little more.
You know, if I've seen you compete a lot of times, I'd like to see a different routine.
So you think you're giving noobs a break a little bit?
I think a little bit, because I haven't seen him in action.
Because I've judged one or two tournaments, not a lot.
I don't get asked to judge tournaments, because I guess I suck at DDR.
But I...
I don't always give newbies a break I mean, I still expect that you better not be looking at the screen
Oh, definitely, definitely.
You better look like you're having fun.
You know what?
Me, personally, that's the number one bitch I have about freestyle routines is that people look depressed while they dance.
And I'm not saying you have to smile like a cheerleader when you play, but at least your expression should match the mood you're trying to convey with what you're doing.
And I realize that sounds a little froofy.
I think the best guy who shows his mood the best way would probably be Bruce Leroy.
On his routine, he's just glowing the whole time.
One of the best, absolutely.
He always just carries it in his expressions.
Yeah, definitely.
You've got to look like you're having fun up there.
If you look like you're bored and just doing something memorized, then you're going to get knocked down a bit.
When you look bored, I hate that.
I hate that more than anything, and I've totally penalized.
Again, I haven't judged on many, but in the ones that I have, I totally would penalize people if they looked bored.
Because then I feel bored.
Anyway, I'm sorry to interrupt.
I went off on a tangent.
It's supposed to be about you, not me.
The last thing that I really look for in judging is make sure you actually have some kind of freestyle routine.
Don't go up there and do a perfect attack.
Just stepping and getting the arrows all right.
you know you got you got to do some kind of moves try a move or something now that used to be cool like way back in the day wasn't there somebody had done a paranoia rebirth routine and it was basically kind of just backwards memorized type thing it doesn't cut it anymore it was cool way back when it was cool back in the day when nobody could pass a 9 footer but let's face it everybody and their mothers passed max 300 by now actually that's so not true because I still I passed max 300 once but that's it I mean honestly
Considering we've been doing this show for how long now, you think that Loki, myself, and DarkSakura would all actually be good DDR players?
We're good, but we're not, you know, oh my god's triple A's on Legend of Max good.
Because unfortunately we're old as well.
We don't have the stamina you kids have.
I find it funny some of the songs that people could pass now that I don't stand a chance on.
Yet I could still go back to a 1-5 machine and play Paranoia 180, the original one on Maniac.
And some people still can't keep up with me on that song.
But they kick my butt on all sorts of other songs on other machines.
Because you take out the vivid and it's just... This is why DarkSakura, she sits here and she always says, Back in my day, we had second mix and we didn't have this vivid stuff.
Yeah, the different colored arrows, that's cheating, man.
I thought I was the shit the first time I played DDR because I passed a two-footer my first game.
But that was because I played a ton of Busta Groove.
And so I already, you know, I kind of had an idea.
I'd watched DDR, I'd kind of taken notes from a distance.
But I remember, I remember Alguana Girl and I played our very first game of DDR together.
And look where she's at and look where I'm at.
She's the co-admin of a huge DDR forum.
Me, I got a shitty little internet show with two of my friends.
Hey, I played with Jason Coe and helped him come up with DDR.com.
There you go.
And now you're a guest on this shitty internet show.
My, how far we've come.
I also remember playing back on 1.5, just trying to see what a Maniac song looked like once we found the code.
Did you say Maniac?
Yeah, I said Maniac.
She's a Maniac, come on.
But, you know, we figured out the Maniac code, and I remember four of us getting on the machine, trying to play one song on Maniac.
Each person added Arrow, and we still couldn't do it.
Wait a minute, I remember people doing that when Max 300 was new, and people wanted to get... No, it was Legend of Max... Goddammit.
Max...
What was the middle one?
What was the middle one?
Max Unlimited, thank you.
Because everybody was like, oh my god, Kakumei, right?
And so I remember watching this happen where everybody was on one arrow and they were doing this together.
It's just like on 2DX.
When people were trying to get the extra stage there, they would play doubles, but they'd have two people playing to make it easier.
Just to hear that song.
I've been judging ever since the way back when.
You know, you might catch me at Golf Land or something playing every now and then, but it's nothing spectacular.
So do you ever do PA at all?
No.
No, you never were a PA?
I'm a member of RTF.
Oh, I didn't realize you were a member.
Yeah, I became an honorary member of RTF and an honorary member of Step Squad.
And then, of course, old school MGL.
All right.
So what do you think... Since you're an old school member of all these clubs, what do you think of all these... It seems like everywhere I look, there's a DDR club, or a little DDR cult.
And I admit, I've been just as bad, because we had our own little DDR cult back in the day, Sacramento.
Everybody hated us.
I still don't know why we weren't... You were the new kids on the block.
That's why.
We were so white.
We were new.
You know, for the longest time... But we were sexy.
For the longest time, it was MGL against SoCal.
They had...
Hey, you gotta stop holding the bar.
No, no, I remember, you know, back when I played... There's a battle in your neck of the woods somewhere.
Yeah, I do the whole California thing because, you know, it was just in this end of the woods when I was playing.
But I remember when I started seeing other crews come up.
Like, I remember seeing one out of Ohio and one out of Iowa.
I was like, what the hell?
They got DDR up there now?
I thought they were all backwards in that country.
Well, especially when these places started getting DDR first.
That was kind of... Oh, yeah, that was really weird because, you know, I played at a test market.
It's like, you know, California is where it's at
and we're supposed to get everything first other than Japan and other people were getting it.
Comment from the chatroom in response to your bar raping comment, DarkSakura.
Misty in the chatroom says, I'd rather bar rape and pass the song.
Okay, thanks.
Could I have a martini while you're on the bar?
No, no.
That was a dumb joke.
That was a really, really dumb joke.
Congratulations.
Yeah, I know, I know.
I get it.
I honestly grab the bar on occasion when I do my Paranoia 180 freestyle.
I do this little criss-cross step thing and I can't stop myself from grabbing that bar to do it.
Otherwise, I'll fall down.
This is the quintessential DDR discussion is bar raping.
It seems like we've had this discussion on the show a thousand times.
But it's been a good month.
It's been a few good months since we've had this discussion, so I'm fine with having it again.
I'm okay if other people want to use the bar because I always say if they don't want you to use the bar, they would not have the bar.
People do take the bar off the machine.
Oh yeah, I love when we do tournaments with no bar.
It's kind of funny.
But, you know, me personally, because I learned to play without the bar, when I go back and try to use the bar, it messes me up even more.
And I've tried because I'm like, maybe I can pass Max Unlimited if I use the bar.
But I can't.
I'm still just too old.
My bones are too frail.
So I just can't do it.
The bar is basically there for me when I'm about to slip and fall on my ass, which does happen occasionally.
Honestly, though, there's something I hate more than bar raping.
Oh, what's that?
That's another Seattleer thing I saw.
Windex on the shoes and on the pants.
I don't get the windex.
Wow.
You're just going to make all sorts of friends here tonight, aren't you?
I'm not here to make friends.
I'm here to be honest.
I never got the Windex and stuff, and I don't know, I guess it works for Seattleers because they seem to get really far in PA.
Yeah, that's right, they kick their ass in PA, really, so maybe you ought to go to the store and buy a bottle of Windex.
See, that's when I slip and fall on my ass, is when the pads are too damn slick.
See, this is the reason why I'm not allowed to judge PA.
I mean, it has nothing to do with the fact that it's all point-based.
There is no, yeah, I'm like, there is no... There's nothing to do with that, you know.
I can't judge.
They won't let me judge PA.
I've asked and asked and asked because I will ream people for stupid ass shit.
Even though they get perfect all the way through a full combo, I'll be like, You'll grab the bar through half the song?
Please step out.
Please do no rape the bar.
I get a kick out of Seattle people.
I love them all.
You know, you play DDR, you're cool with me.
Fair enough.
Just...
Just play the game.
Just play the damn game.
Enough of the drama drama.
Just play the damn game.
Yeah, yeah.
Because honestly, some of us have issues even being able to play the game recently.
You know, I sat here for like an hour today going, maybe I should get out of the DDR pad and play.
Because I ate a lot over this holiday season.
A lot.
And I could stand to play some DDR.
I could stand to play about 48 hours straight worth of DDR to work off all the crap I ate over the holiday weekend.
But it's just not going to happen because I'm lazy.
Man, I'm ready to get back into my own routine.
I was at Scandia today staring at the machine like, hey, I could play that again.
You know, I used to play, you know, every night I was at MGL because I never paid for tokens.
I drove by Roseville Golf Land twice over this past little few days here over Christmas, and both times I actually contemplated stopping in, which is more than I could say for six months ago.
I hear it's gotten a lot better now.
Scania's a lot different now, too.
I think DDR's dead.
I don't think DDR's dead.
Thanks for watching!
Very true, very true.
Oh, Loki says there's a new arcade release coming out and we'll talk about that during the next break.
What a good segue.
Okay, we're going to go to a break.
We're going to come back.
We're going to have our cage match with our special guest entry courtesy of our winner from the random pick, BRP Ohio Bomani.
is going to have the chat room.
Big Red Pimp, that's right, that's what he goes by.
Big Red Pimp.
Sounds like a red mage in Final Fantasy.
He's going to have our chat room choice tonight.
Loki, by the way, if you're wondering why you haven't heard from Loki all this break, he's cooking right now.
What exactly are you cooking over there, Loki?
Fried rice!
He's making his fried rice.
So we'll be able to have some of that here on the show.
Alright, we'll be back after this break.
We're going to get some music from 2DX Red, another big game in 2004, a little later this year.
And we'll be back after this.
We're going to start it off with a little bit of Double A, something I know you guys go for in DDR sometimes.
We'll be back.
Thanks for watching!
and many more.
Thanks for watching!
and many more.
Gaming Radio.
So uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.
Orange Lounge Radio.
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
Episode number 124.
And I have no idea what that means, what the significance of 124 is.
But next week would be 125, that's kind of a, that's like, you know, a dollar and a quarter, that's pretty big.
So anyway, we're here, we've got myself, Loki, if you're just joining us, DarkSakura's out tonight, she's a little sick, apparently she's been sleeping a lot, had a resurgence of some virus, that's gotta suck to get sick on Christmas though, but I've been there, it sucks, it's no fun, and DarkChild is here tonight, filling in, which is good, we haven't heard from DarkChild in a while, and he's old school, we were talking a little bit in that last segment there, just about some old school, we're living some old school memories.
So looking forward to the future, because this is the last show of the year, what do you think Bomani has in store for 2005?
You think we're all going to move on, get a life, go to a new game, or what do you think the Bomani scene has in store for 2005?
I see some more DDR coming out.
I'd like to see some more come out from Japan with some Japanese songs on it instead of this U.S.
marketed bullcrap with Britney Spears to dance to.
Now wait a minute, Britney Spears has not been in a DDR mix yet.
Not yet.
She has her own series of music games, remember?
Yes, yes.
But you know, I'm betting though, with more DDR coming out in the U.S., there'll be a lot more U.S.
artists in there.
Stuff that would attract a larger audience than just the Bambani people.
You know, someone comes out to the arcade, hears a song they know on the radio, and they see it's on a game, they're probably more likely to dance on it.
I'm hoping 2DX keeps going, because that's the game I play now, instead of DDR.
If that game is tight, I've seen some songs from 2DX Red where apparently they're some of the hardest songs ever released before and I've seen the videos of two guys on doubles not passing it.
There's some pretty crazy shit in 2DX Red.
That's all I know so far.
Yeah, Garrett was kind enough to show me videos.
It's insane.
That's all I really see for the Bomani scene is just more DDR, more 2DX coming to the U.S.
Hopefully they bring out some other crazy ass games.
I wouldn't mind playing that one butt poking game.
Boonga Boonga?
Yeah, Boonga Boonga.
Alright.
Let's see, I'm going to put my Miss Cleo hat on here and try to make some Bomani predictions for 2005.
Yes, looking deep into my crystal ball.
Bomani predictions 2005.
Let's see.
I predict that there will be an Ultramix 3.
There's definitely going to be an Ultramix 3.
I predict there will be an Ultramix 3.
Because Ultramix 2 is so beloved by the community that there will be an Ultramix 3.
And I predict that a different drum will be involved again.
Let's see, what else do I predict?
I predict that there will be an Extreme 2 in the US.
But it won't be called Extreme 2.
I think they're going to release... I would say... Remember, I have no inside knowledge here.
I'm going completely off my Miss Cleo hat here.
I would say that there's going to be an Extreme 2, but they'll call it Party Collection, just to mess with us.
But it won't be a rehash of Greatest Hits.
It'll be something completely new.
And it will have Sakura in it, because everybody bitched when Sakura wasn't in DDR Extreme USA, so there will be Sakura in it.
I think about mid-year we're going to see a new DDR arcade machine in Japan.
But it's going to be different.
That's all.
And I think 2DX will continue.
There'll still be more Guitar Freak and Drum Mania mixes that we won't know what to do with them.
Same thing with pop and music.
And I predict that there will be another type of rhythm and music game by the end of the year.
Like, you know how they did Mambo Go Go once?
I think they're going to try something else.
And some people will like it and some won't.
That's my prediction.
Very vague stuff.
G4 will still suck!
Any other predictions you want to make, Loki?
Oh, he's over there cooking.
He doesn't care.
He doesn't care about what's going on over here.
All right.
We were talking a little bit in the last segment before we went to break there.
Loki had actually brought up that there is a new DDR machine coming out.
Because there is a new DDR machine coming out in the UK.
And we actually posted a little news item over to our website, orangeloungeradio.com.
And it does appear...
That Dancing Stage Fusion Arcade is still happening, and there is some more information on the official Konami site, which you can go to just by clicking on the link there.
And it says, and I quote, this is all we have to go off of so far.
There's a little picture of the machine, and it says, Spinning its way into Europe is the latest Dancing Stage sensation.
Step back onto the stage, take the limelight, and strut your Christmas stuff to Fusion Arcade.
Jerry Halliwell, Atomic Kitten, Kim Wilde and a whole host of other well-known artists will be starring in Fusion, making it the biggest and best selection of tracks to date.
and that's all they have to say about it.
So there is a new machine coming and all these artists we hear there have been in DDR before.
Jerry Halliwell, It's Rainin' Men, Atomic Kitten right now, Fifth Mix and Kim Wilde was a home release, Kids in America, right?
In DDR Extreme USA and Party Collector, or not Party Collector, Festival.
Fusion.
Oh, it wasn't in Festival?
My bad, my bad.
I thought it was.
I can't keep them all straight.
There's so many DDR mixes, I can't keep them all straight anymore.
Alright.
So, we know that's coming.
We don't have a release date.
We don't know if it is a hardware upgrade, what it's going to look like.
Loki says it is a hardware upgrade, but we don't know what it's going to look like, which is my point, if you'll let me finish my thought.
So, we don't know.
Loki's
Loki's cooking, so we don't have a microphone right now, but he's yelling about some show where they're going to show this on the 25th through 27th of December?
January.
January of January.
So we should have some more information come the end of January.
So that's kind of exciting.
A little bit.
A little bit, because if something new comes out in Europe, you know, maybe.
Maybe here.
Maybe.
We'll see.
I don't know about here, but at least Japan, hopefully.
Hopefully.
We shall see.
Soon enough.
Alright, how about we get into tonight's cage match, boys and girls.
How's that sound?
Terrific.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and tonight.
And let's see, which track of yours won last week?
Was that Speed Demon?
I'm sorry.
House of Joy.
Why don't I have House of Joy queued up here?
Alright, I gotta find it.
Dark Child, help me fill time here while I figure out where my music is.
I'm so depressed, people.
You know, I'm single now.
That was a shocker to me and
I'm trying everything I can to win her back, because that woman was a part of me.
She was my soulmate, at least in my eyes.
And I miss her so much.
If anyone knows any way they could help or advice they could give me to possibly try and win her back, please let me know.
I could give you my email address.
It's dchild, spelled D-C-H-Y, L-D-E, 999, at yahoo.com.
Stalkers, have fun.
As long as it doesn't have a forward listed in the beginning of the title, I'll probably read it.
Or if it says Tub Girl, you probably will not read it then.
No, no, no, I've seen Tub Girl too many times.
I don't mind.
I'm a freak.
And I am an IT guy, so don't try to send me viruses, otherwise I will bring hell on your computer.
Alright, let's get into tonight's cage match.
Here we go.
Last week in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, Loki won it with an old Orange Lounge Radio favorite, Monolithic, a.k.a.
Mini Head, and the track is House of Joy.
Remember, the Cage Match works this way.
Three songs are put into the Cage Match, and you guys vote for your favorite.
And the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio Live.
So here we go.
You guys get to pick.
Remember, you get your vote.
And you get a clip of last week's winner because you were listening last week, right?
So you already heard this song.
So you only get a clip.
So here it is.
Song number one that you can vote for tonight.
A clip of Monolithic House of Joy.
Alright, song number one, a clip of Monolithic with House of Joy.
Will it hold on, or will it bow down to the chatroom challenger?
We will see tonight.
But I still get a song, so I'm going to put in my song.
I downloaded a dance compilation a couple days ago, and I've been grooving to it.
There's a lot of cute, poppy little songs on it, so I'm going to put in a nice song.
Don't Walk Away Don't Walk Away
I've got all this love, waiting just for you I just gotta know that your love is true Can't keep running boy, in and out my life Wanna be your girl, not cause I'm rude, it's right If I had to come inside tomorrow Will you hide, will you be there for me When I need someone to hold Baby, don't be so distant
Thank you for watching!
I've got all this love waiting just for you I just gotta know that your love is true
Thank you for watching!
I'll be right there for you
Alright, that was song number two, Javine, Don't Walk Away, and let's see if the folks in our studio wanted to walk away or walk real close to that song.
Dark Child, what did you think of Don't Walk Away?
I thought it was a nice trancy song, you know, kind of uplifting for the mood I'm in, and I liked it.
Wow, you're usually full of hatred for our cage match picks.
Yeah, but you know, I'm full of hatred when I walked in the door today, and you know, you managed to play a song that kind of uplifted me a bit.
Oh, okay.
Don't walk away.
Javine, don't walk away.
Or maybe Javine, I don't know.
J-A-V-I-N-E, I want to say Javine, that's what I'm going to say.
How about Javine?
Javier, alright, give it a score.
I'll give it about a 7 right now.
You know when I first heard that song I would have given it like an 8, but I really like that song a lot more the more I listen to it.
It's very DDR-ish, it reminds me of T.E.F.
actually a lot.
So I give it a 9.
Actually no, I want to give it a 9 too.
You know what, Anita, just listen to the song, please.
Oh my, okay, Loki, what would you give that song?
He's holding up 8.
Alright, he's too busy cooking to give a shit about anything else right now.
All right, let's get into song number three.
Remember, it doesn't matter what we think.
It comes down to your guys' votes, so let's find out.
All right, here we go.
Chat room choice.
Big Red Pimp.
Ohio Bomani putting this one in on behalf of our chat room.
Here it is.
And this is... You know what?
This is okay because this is the kind of song I could kind of see Jamie putting in.
She likes the J-pop and stuff, so this is good.
It's Larkin Seal, and the song is called Ready, Steady, Go.
Not to be confused with the Paul Oakenfold one, okay?
So here it is, the chatroom choice, song number three, Larkin Seal, Ready, Steady, Go.
Enjoy!
S, Actdeft,
S, Actdeft, Drew,
Thank you for watching!
Thanks for watching!
All righty, that was song number three in tonight's cage match.
Larkin Seal, Ready Steady Go.
What do you think?
Ready Steady Go or Ready Steady Go Away?
What do you think?
Sounds like a pop music song.
Sounds like a bunch of pop music songs.
I kind of got the Guitar Freak vibe from it.
Guitar Freak, pop music, same thing.
Oh, I kind of liked it.
I saw some people in the chatroom said it sounded kind of like Full Metal Alchemist, which I kind of would have to agree with.
I believe that's where the song came from, was an FMA fan site.
That's what they were saying, yeah.
So, you know, I kind of liked it for a little J-pop-y song.
I'll give it about a 7.
No, no, I'll give it a 9.
Anita, don't listen to the name of that song.
Alright.
I liked it, actually.
It was very good.
I was a little wary about letting the chatroom pick something, but I think they did a good job on that one.
I guess Angel helped on that, I'm supposed to say.
But anyway, I thought it was good.
I'd give it about an 8.5.
It was good.
I could see that in a Babani game.
Very poppy.
I liked it.
Loki.
That song sucks!
All right.
All right, fair enough.
I'm glad the chat room could get a little bit of what that's like to have your song dissed by Loki because that happens to me every freaking week.
Luckily it's not up to him though, it's up to you guys.
So here we go, three songs, here's a recap.
You can place your votes right after this recap of the three songs you can vote for tonight.
Song number one, Monolithic, House of Joy.
Song number two you can vote for tonight, Javeen, Don't Walk Away.
Song number three you can vote for tonight, Larkin Seal, Ready Steady Go.
All right, place vote now.
Send a private message to Sky in the chatroom with your vote.
Will Monolithic, a fan favorite, hold on for tonight?
Will the chatroom pick make it in?
After all, it was picked by the chatroom, so it kind of gets some instant votes there.
That's kind of unfair, but we'll see.
Or will Javine kind of sneak in there, end up getting through a split vote, and walk away with it?
We'll see.
In the famous words of P. Diddy, vote or die.
Plenty of votes already, so we'll see.
Alright, let's see, I wanted to open up the Skype line to hopefully talk to some of our callers.
I just wanted to check out, you know, what kind of loot you guys got for Christmas, especially when it comes to games and video games and things like that.
I'm kind of curious about what kind of loot you guys got.
If you were naughty or nice this year, what Santa brought you instead.
So we'll see.
I'm going to open up the Skype line there.
Remember, if you want more information on the Skype line, head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on Interact With Us.
For those of you guys that are kind of new to Orange Lounge Radio, the Skype line allows you to talk.
All you've got to have is a microphone, and then you don't have to have a phone.
All you've got to do is call over the Internet.
Please, though, before you call the show, make sure all your pornography torrents are turned off.
because it will fudge up your bandwidth and then we have a hard time hearing you and we have to hang up on you.
We don't like doing that.
I know Loki does enjoy hanging up on people, but please turn the porn torrents off before you call.
And for the love of God, first rule of real radio, and it applies to internet radio as well,
Turn your speakers down when you call in, please.
Because we don't need to hear ourselves, okay?
We hear enough of ourselves doing this show.
So please do not leave your speakers up when you call in.
So we'll wait and see if anybody calls in.
I do notice that we only have about half the people listening tonight that we usually do, which is kind of a hit for us.
I understand why, probably because a lot of folks are away doing the holiday thing.
They're at mommy's house or grandma's house or something and they're doing the holiday stuff.
They're playing with their new DS or they're doing something.
We just don't have the same amount of people that we usually do, so they'll be all tuning in Friday on DER Freak to catch what they missed.
And that's at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time, if you want to hear that.
Also, though, we do have other spin-off programming here on Orange Lounge Radio, including...
Diversion, the Orange Lounge Radio Remix show.
That's on Monday nights.
And Tuesday nights, Pump Up the Volume featuring DarkSakura.
Hopefully she'll be back.
I know she's a little bit sick, but she should be coming back this Tuesday.
We'll see.
We'll check in with her.
Hopefully she's doing alright.
And then Thursday nights, Outside the Box, where...
Myself, RicePrincess, and LikeyStyle talk about all sorts of other video gaming things.
Maybe postpone this week.
LikeyStyle had some work issues come up.
He's not been able to come to the show.
I should be here, though.
We might just do a Sky experience, if nothing else.
So we'll see.
So that's all the programming you can look forward to.
And something else brand new.
Something brand new we're looking to roll out this week.
But we're not going to talk about it just yet, because we want to make sure all the T's are crossed and all the I's are dotted.
It's a new program, but it's not something you're going to hear on Live365.
But I'm going to spoil it for you right now.
It's going to be the Loki fried rice experience.
Woohoo!
Ass.
Alright.
DarkSakura.com
That's about number nine on the list.
So we'll see.
We're hoping.
Watch our website, www.orangeentree.com.
Watch the website.
We should have more information on that sometime this week.
All right.
Nobody's calling in the Skype line.
You guys are all shy.
I see how it is.
It's fine.
It's fine.
Well, we only have about half the people we usually do.
I think a lot of our regular callers are out tonight.
So fine.
Whatever.
One other thing I wanted to talk about.
I want to talk about some of the things coming up with the new year.
We've been talking about our predictions for what Bomani is going to look like in the new year.
How about those new year's resolutions you don't intend on keeping?
What are some of those new year's resolutions you guys are going to be setting that you do not intend on keeping?
Or maybe you do intend on keeping it.
I don't know.
Loki.
Celibacy.
Come on, that's not even something you would ever even suggest.
I'm talking about things that you might actually consider doing.
You're not going to be celibate.
I think your girlfriend would have a problem with that.
Or maybe not, I don't know.
You're pretty quick to say that.
Do you have any serious things you want to commit yourself to doing?
Like, I don't know, maybe sit-ups?
Finishing the cabinets?
Dark Child, New Year's Resolutions you don't intend on keeping?
Oh, I intend on keeping all of them.
Alright, well, anything you want to share with our, that would be appropriate to share with our listeners?
Yeah, basically, uh, to grow up finally.
You know, I've been acting a lot younger than I should be, and
All right, we're going to go to the phones because we got a call, so let's go to the phones.
Hello, you're on Orange Zones Radio.
Yo.
Hi, who dis?
Big Red Pimp.
Hello, Big Red Pimp, how are you?
I'm pretty good.
All right, I have to ask, why Big Red Pimp?
Tall, red-headed, and dressed like a damn.
Okay, okay, I got it.
Now, you were the guy that picked Larkin Seal, Ready, Steady, Go!
for tonight's cage match, right?
Yep.
All right, why did you choose that song?
I'm just hooked on Full Metal Alchemist right now.
Okay, so you're on a Full Metal Alchemist kick, so that works.
Alright.
How was your Christmas?
Oh, by the way.
Yes.
Loki had to vote for your song just to be civil about it.
Oh, so you voted for Loki's song just to be civil?
Yep.
Oh, that's it.
So, even though you went and hated on that song, Loki, he went and voted for your song.
Wasn't that nice of him?
He just realized what the better song was.
Oh, snap.
What do you have to say about that?
I'd have a dirt clod for you.
How was your Christmas?
How was your holiday?
It was pretty good, other than getting a migraine from my niece.
Oh, I'm sorry.
How old's your niece?
Four years old.
I see.
Most four-year-olds do cause migraines.
Happens at the arcade all the time.
Did you get what you wanted for Christmas?
Not quite, except for the money.
Money's good.
What did you ask for for Christmas?
Nothing.
You didn't ask for anything?
I didn't ask for anything because nobody could afford anything.
Well, then you can't be disappointed with what you got if you didn't have anything on your list, right?
Exactly.
There you go.
I'd be disappointed if I asked for nothing and someone gave me something.
He says he'd be a little disappointed if he asked for nothing and then he got something.
At least this year I have heat in the house, so I don't have to worry about anything.
There you go.
Now see, me personally, I don't make lists either, but I'm very grateful with whatever I get, because I always like when people buy me things, because hey, free stuff.
And see, the best thing about getting money is that you're not disappointed with whatever you buy.
Exactly.
Money is a great Christmas present.
There you go.
Any New Year's resolutions you don't intend on keeping?
To get off this caffeine high.
Get off the caffeine high.
How much caffeine would you say you're drinking a day?
Actually, I stopped last week, but I've been kind of dipping out into a little bit of caffeine, so I'm like one can of Pepsi a day.
Well, you know that's why you're getting the migraines there, because you're kicking the caffeine habit, and so caffeine is something that helps prevent migraines.
This happened to me a lot when I kicked the caffeine habit, because I used to be the kind of guy, I would drink one of those 20-ounce bottles of Mountain Dew, Code Red, every morning to wake up, and I kicked it, and I got a lot of headaches when I quit, but I'll tell you what, I lost a lot of weight too.
Yeah, I kicked my caffeine habit.
I was on
Like six mocha frappe full bars a day.
That's five shots of espresso in there.
Plus all kinds of other espresso drinks.
I worked at a coffee shop.
It was horrible.
But when I quit it, you know, I was shaking, migraines and everything.
But eventually I did.
Ugly.
Ugly.
I had no choice but to get off the caffeine because I kind of had a panic attack.
Oh, ouch.
Well, I hope this is the road to getting better for you then.
I think you're going to find, though, that, you know, when you stop drinking all that soda and if you ever decide that you can switch from Pepsi to Diet Pepsi...
That you'll start losing weight because it's all these calories.
That's how I lost anyway.
Of course, I gained it all back over Christmas, but that's alright.
I'll lose it again.
Some suggestions in the chatroom as well.
Rayum says in our chatroom, extra water helps with a migraine.
So drink tons of water.
Okay.
Alright.
Some friendly advice from us here at Orange Lounge Radio.
Alright, I'll get off here now.
Alright, feel better.
Alright, bye.
New Caller, we like it when new people call in, yay.
And then we don't look so stupid by not getting any calls, so that makes me feel really good.
Alright, we're going to go to a break, and in this break we're going to take care of a few requests.
We had some songs that were requested, so we're going to take care of those, and I'm going to grab myself some fried rice, dammit, because that stuff is smelling very good, and I want some, so I'm going to... What did you say?
It's a little heavy on the soy sauce, I put a little too much.
That's alright, cancer sounds fine to me.
Don't they say that causes cancer or something?
I don't know.
One way to find out.
Alright, we'll go to this break.
We're going to tally up the cage match votes and figure out about that when we come back.
We'll get to the FUs of the week at some point as well.
We'll be back after this on Orange Launch Radio.
Thanks for watching!
Lala Lala Lala Lala Lala Lala Lala
Thank you for watching!
I'm a dream, it's unreal
And now it's time for Erotic Pop Idol, where we will find the next singer for everyone's favorite perverse Bomani band, Erotic.
Do it all night, do it with me.
No, no, that was awful, bloody terrible.
Do you take vocal lessons?
Kill your teacher.
In the heat of the night.
Oh, God, I think my ears are bleeding.
I liked it.
Shut the bloody hell up, Paula.
Next.
Do you even know why you're here?
That was just bloody pathetic!
Next!
Yes!
Yes, that's it!
We have a winner!
A star is born here on Orange Lounge Radio Yes, a star is born here on Orange Lounge Radio Remember when I always used to say that when we played that promo?
She did beatboxing and scene.
No wonder she won.
I know, amazing.
That's an old promo, but I thought I would play that because isn't American Idol coming back pretty soon?
Doesn't that usually show up in January?
I don't know, I don't watch it anymore.
As I became retarded.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
You and the girlfriend used to watch it every single week religiously.
What the hell's going on?
Yeah, that was like two years ago.
We also used to watch The Apprentice.
Didn't do that anymore.
We also used to watch Survivor.
Stopped doing that.
Why?
Because the shows just got tired.
They need to be retired.
No, no, you just want to have sex more.
Shows are tired.
And you started watching Queer Eye.
Yeah, but we've already seen all those.
So now they're all reruns.
All right.
If I sound like I'm eating right now, it's because I am.
You should get some of this, Dark Knight.
It's very good.
It's some of Loki's fried rice.
Did I say Dark Knight?
Dark Child.
You people with Dark in your name, you're all the same.
Dark Dragon, Dark Person, Dark Demon, Dark... You know, what?
I say we just quit the show.
We'll take Dark Knight here and go trick-or-treating.
See, you did it too!
That's okay, because remember, I have a new nickname now.
I'm no longer Dark Child.
I'm now Darkophelion.
He's now Dark Man.
No longer a child.
He has become a man.
Dark Man died, died, died.
I like it.
Yeah, let's not confuse him with that really horrible movie.
It actually had sequels.
Why?
Wait, isn't that Donnie Darko?
No, Dark Man.
Remember the stupid guy with his face got burnt off or something?
So he makes a new face, and it's like the whole Phantom of the Opera thing going, but really stupid.
Wasn't that Mel Gibson, the man without a face?
No, no, no, this is Dark Man.
It's just like another line in the series, just like the Tremors movies, just like Species, just like... Oh, what's another really shitty movie that they made a lot of?
The Relic.
No, Nightmare on Elm Street, actually, everything's theatrical.
It's just, um, like, uh, Hellraiser.
There are all these horror movies that just keep having sequels.
Children of the Corn.
Children of the Corn.
There are all these horror movies that have, like, tons of sequels that no one ever hears about.
The Leprechaun.
It's just like, Leprechaun, back in the hood.
Leprechaun 2, in the hood, back to the hood.
Like, they thought they needed, you know, we just don't have enough...
Leprechaun in the Hood, We Need More.
Who makes these decisions?
Seriously.
Was that like, well, this is the best thing we've got.
I mean, is that bad over there?
I swear.
I mean, honestly, I have seen horror movies that I don't know how the fuck they get distributed on tape.
I mean, because I collect these things.
I have, like, I say the worst movie I have ever seen other than Manos and the Hands of Fate.
Because Manos, I've watched that on Mystery Science Theater 3000.
I've watched it by itself.
No matter what, that movie is so boring, it will put me to sleep every time.
You survived watching it with itself, not Mystery Science Theater?
It was hard.
Now wait, here we go, here we go.
I got a brilliant idea.
We're going to kill two birds with one stone.
Since we are Orange Lounge Radio, and we are a Bomani, supposedly we're about Bomani and music video games, supposedly, although we know we're really not.
We're all about that.
And we like horror movies, and we've decided we need to make a direct-to-video horror movie.
Here it is.
We're going to make...
DDR Freak, the horror movie.
What do you think?
Because everybody's been complaining about how they want to see a DDR Freak movie.
There you go.
We'll just have it be a horror movie.
We'll film it at Golfland and like children will die, only they're really dying.
That's stupid.
I think it'd be alright as long as it doesn't have a sequel called DDR Spot.
And then Warwick Davis will be in it.
Give me back me pot of gold.
Give me back me tokens.
Oh my god.
No.
No.
See, the thing with DDR is it doesn't translate well at all to cinema.
You just, there's no... Okay, you got served.
Case in point.
Oh, well, actually, wait a minute.
I'm kind of fighting myself here on our... Hey, you forgot about Wasabi.
The DDR part of that was tight.
I didn't remember that.
But anyways, the whole point of it is there's no actual story to DDR, so you cannot make, you know, a DDR movie.
What if you had DDR... Now...
What about The Wizard?
You can't make a movie about video games, but they made this, you know, going plot.
That wasn't Super Mario Bros.
movies.
Shut your damn mouth for a minute.
What if they had, it's like The Wizard, like that was 15 years ago, and you know how they remake movies once they're, you know, so old?
We could remake The Wizard, but now the central thing is DDR.
And there's a kid, and it could star DDR Bot, because he's a kid, right?
And DDR Bot is like this product.
California!
Exactly!
He's this prodigy at DDR.
Hey, he took first place at Max Games.
Okay, here we go.
I'm on a thigh here.
Okay, so DDR bot, kid who's really good at DDR, and he's going to Universal Studios for the big DDR tournament.
What did they call it in The Wizard?
What was the name of it?
Armageddon!
DDRmageddon!
Right?
So that'll be the tournament that's at Universal Studios.
And then when we get there...
DDR Extreme 2, a game that nobody's ever seen.
And then, like, you could be in it, and you've got, like, this device that you have on your feet, the Power Boots, and it's like, no, that's so stupid.
The Power Boots, they're so bad.
And they have little LED lights in them that light up to the music.
Yeah, right.
And then will DDR Bot mysteriously just know the secret code for the game even though it just came out?
That could be Mel B, because Mel B would have the power boots.
Think about it, guys.
Think about it.
And then, like, see, DDR Bot and his wacky friends.
And we'll be the wacky friends.
You, me, and DarkSakura can be the wacky friends.
Because you remember... Shut up!
You remember that in The Wizard there was that sassy girl that went with him that, ah, he touched my breast.
Remember that?
That could be DarkSakura.
Ah, he touched my breast.
There you go.
And then, like, you and I can somehow be Fred Savage.
This is great.
I'm freaking writing a letter to Warner Brothers tomorrow.
Well, they did make Catwoman, so why not?
No, honestly, that's a retarded idea.
How about a horror movie?
Oh, okay, okay.
Okay, and then at the end, everybody gets killed.
There you go.
Oh, okay.
Except DDR Bot, because he's cool.
But Yumi and Jamie, we die horrible, gruesome deaths.
DDR Bot does like a whole Children of the Corn thing, and he's the reason everybody dies.
He's like,
Gozal, Carrie Fisher on him.
There you go.
See, I'm liking this.
I should write movies.
I would be a millionaire.
There's so many bad movies out there.
And they're just, you know, they keep on making them.
Like, um... Let's see here.
Oh, I don't know.
House of the Dead?
Awful movie.
I still have to watch that just because it's so bad.
I honestly...
It's so bad.
Shut up.
How about we just have the Power Glove again?
It wouldn't make any sense anyways, so why not?
Okay, the Power Glove allows you to play DDR with your hand.
Like a virtual keyboard?
Like, no, you can wave your hand and it does things.
You know what's sad?
Para para, I don't know.
For like half a second, I think, this week while I was sitting there board drooling in front of my computer monitor, I think I actually thought about trying to use a Power Glove in such fashion.
Here we go, here we go, I know how we can end the DDR movie, okay?
So DDR Bot wins the tournament, okay?
And then in this classic Hollywood ending, you know those things that would never happen in real life, this is what happens at the end of the movie, you ready for it?
All the male DDR players get laid.
even better ALIEN SPACECRAFT COME FROM THE SKY WE NEED YOU TO COME TO SAVE THE WORLD yeah it could be like one of those really stupid movies like where you know music will save the world or something like that one of those alien movies where they have to play DDR to save the world cause that's awesome
D.D.R.
to save the world.
And then you can have really horrible renditions of the D.D.R.
characters.
Like, for instance, you know, Guile played by Jean-Claude Van Damme.
Okay, with the fucking carrots.
Rage can be played by The Rock.
And, let's see, Emmy would be played by Angelina Jolie.
I'm liking this so far.
And they could be like the comic relief.
Like they show up along our journey and provide that random sage advice.
I'm liking this.
I'm going to go write this all down.
Naoki will be played by Harvey Fierstein.
Oh my god, you guys!
You've got to go to the DDI tournament and play my song.
Oh!
I gotta call my mother!
That would be hilarious to have like some sort of arena, like Iron Chef, and he would be like the chairman.
You know, cause he's like flamboyant like the chairman.
God, it's wrong!
It's so wrong, I feel so dirty!
Alright, alright.
Uh, we got comments in our chatroom here.
DJ Ranma S says, by the way, there was an actual DDR movie.
God, we beat this thing to death.
It was really bad.
There was a plot written for one, and Haley Jo Osment was cast for the role of the hero.
I don't believe that for half a second.
I'm sorry to say.
Nope, that's fake.
Ranma, nothing against you.
I don't know where you got that news from.
Maybe it did come from a legitimate news source, but I'm sorry to say.
Oh, come on, look at this.
It's a pile of shit.
Uh-oh!
Yes!
Did you know that the D... Doctor Movie, because D-R... What are you looking at?
You're looking at some page over on Tripod.
It's shit.
This is not...
What the hell are these people doing?
I think it's somebody having the same conversation on AOL that we just had, basically.
Except they've got Miss Cleo in their movie.
Please, please people, please.
Miss Cleo is so three years ago.
Okay?
Stop.
Now, now.
She was in DDR Vice City.
No, in Grand Theft Auto Vice City.
I like DJ Ranma's new idea because it's Team DDR to battle Team Pump It Up.
I'm down for that movie.
Afro, played by Samuel Jackson.
The whole last 15 minutes of the movie is them just serving each other back and forth.
I love it.
And they can shoot lasers when they have a combo.
I don't know.
It's fucking retarded.
All right, we're going to reopen up the Skype.
Actually, I take it back.
There is only one way that there could be a DDR movie, and this could actually work.
Now, anyone out there has probably read it.
It's the 10K commotion, which is...
A webcomic out there right now, and that actually does have a storyline that does involve DDR that would actually translate well into film.
No, here it is, here it is.
Kevin Smith writes a DDR movie.
Oh, God.
And it's just about a bunch of slackers, which is true to life, that go to play DDR and just, you know, the wacky antics that ensue.
There you go.
Is it going to be called Hot Arrow Sex?
With sex spelled, you know, S-E-C-X?
There you go.
See, I'm full of good ideas here.
This is the only thing.
Joel Schumacher is not allowed to direct the DDR movie because he ruins everything he touches!
Everything!
He did not ruin the Phantom of the Opera.
He put his poo on it a little bit.
I did see the smearing of the poo.
It could have been better.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Hey, what's up?
Hi, who is this?
Outface.
Hi, Outface.
Is this THE Outface?
Oh my god, yes.
Oh my god.
Oh my god.
I don't think you are.
Alright, you have a comment.
Um, that whole movie idea is just not really right.
No.
You know what?
It's better than half the shit that Hollywood's putting out anyway.
Did you see Crossroads?
Did you see it?
Britney Spears, Three Friends, no, forget it.
I mean, come on.
I would watch the DDR movie 20 times before I'd watch it.
There's only one situation I want to see with Britney Spears and Three Friends, and that was in Crossroads.
Although Crossroads could be a title.
I'm sorry, Michael, did you have another comment?
I don't know.
You had to get a hell of a lot better actors than them.
I know, I know.
You'd have to get some decent actors.
We would just have to get unknowns.
Basically, it would star us, is the deal.
Alright, how was your holiday?
It was alright.
It was alright?
Did you get any good stuff?
Did Santa bring you some good stuff?
Oh, yeah.
Xbox is about it.
Well, there you go.
Are you gonna play Ultramix 2?
Not bloody likely.
Any particular reason why?
Do you even play DDR, sir?
Really?
Do you even play DDR?
Yeah, DDR.
But DDR, Guitar Freak, crap like that.
There you go, there you go.
But not interested in Ultramix 2?
No, not really.
Alright, well there you go.
It's not Japanese enough for you, or what's the deal?
Eh, it was alright.
Maybe it's the console that it plays on is the size of a house.
Alright, then what games are you going to play?
Are you a Halo person?
Is that what it's all about?
Oh yeah, Halo is the shit.
There you go.
You're a Halo person.
I understand that.
I played Halo 2 for two weeks, and then I gave up.
Because I suck.
It happens.
Any New Year's resolutions you don't intend on keeping?
Oh, hell yeah.
Like what?
I plan on not spending so much money on the ARK, but that is so not going to work.
It so doesn't work for me every year either.
Unless the arcades turn to shit, then it's easy to not go.
Or they get overrun with children.
Anything else?
Nah.
Have a good one, boss.
Alright, thanks for calling.
Have a good one.
The winner of tonight's cage match
Really shouldn't be too hard to figure out.
You let the chatroom pick, and the chatroom wins.
Yeah, I get to pick a better song.
Ready, steady, go.
In your face, Loki.
In your face.
You got served.
I won last week.
What do I care?
I was making rice.
I'm full, man.
I am so goddamn full.
Alright.
We're going to go to a break, you guys.
When we come back, we are going to do the FUs of the week, and I know you guys have probably got quite a few things that you're a little bit angsty about this week, especially with the holidays.
So go ahead and send in those FUs of the week now, and we'll get to those when we come back after this break, featuring music.
Since he kind of got me thinking about Ultramix 2, I think we're going to play some stuff from Ultramix 2.
How's that sound, you guys?
I'm nuts.
Shut up.
We're gonna play some Ultramix 2 stuff and we'll be back.
We're gonna start it off with I Feel, the Junk Circuit mix.
We'll be back after this.
Do you feel it?
Thanks for watching!
You can hear it.
Thanks for watching!
Baby, only the strong will survive Oh, the misery, the life Only factors will keep you away In the lonely peace of the broken ship
I will meet you there, cause I need you there
Thank you for watching!
Orange Lounge Radio is proud to present a celebrity interview.
Can you introduce yourself for our listeners?
I'm Miss Cleo.
Oh, it's great to have you on the show today.
Hello, how are you today?
I'm great, thanks.
Did you have a question?
Well, yes.
Actually, I wanted to know... Can I please have your first name only and your birth date, please?
Uh, well, no.
I actually just wanted to know what you thought of Orange Lounge Radio.
Alright, go ahead.
Well, what do you think of Loki, one of the three hosts of Orange Lounge Radio?
Is he incarcerated?
Actually, no, he's not.
But what do you think of the ever-ranty DarkSakura?
Hi, dear, how are you?
I love you.
I see you two must know each other.
Well, what do you think of Skye?
Did he used to play football when he was in high school?
Well, actually, no, he didn't.
Well, what do you think of Intern Zero?
I want you to really remember the pill, alright?
I'm seeing some forgetting, possibly.
And I'm seeing a new baby in the next three months.
Right, okay, well, thanks for being on Orange Lounge Radio today.
Um, I don't mean to sidetrack your question here, but... Who are all of these nosy people?
Outside influences I'm seeing around you by the moon card.
Get away from me.
Orange Lounge Radio, helping to free your mind and spirit.
I'm Miss Cleo.
I love you.
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and...
Yeah, that Miss Cleo thing, so four years ago, right?
We can't hear you, buddy.
Is the mic on?
It's a dead mic, buddy.
We can't hear you on it.
That's our guest mic.
It just doesn't work anymore.
I said, holy shit, dude, that was funny as hell.
I'd never heard it before.
That's pretty good.
You know it's old, though, because it talks about Intern Zero on there.
That guy's been MIA for like a year and a half now, so...
What's going on in the sim scene this week, my friend?
Not a... Still, DDR Maniacs is down, gone.
Merry Christmas, it's not there anymore.
DDR UK, they're saying that the Ultramix 2 and Fusion stuff will be released when it's released.
That's the official word.
They were upgrading their servers, so I don't know what that means as far as release time.
But it's still out there, still in limbo, should be almost done.
I think they're just finishing up on basic, or not basic, the beginner steps.
And that's pretty much it.
Because now I guess there's beginner doubles, from what I've heard.
So they're doing that.
And other than that, there's some pretty good stuff on BomaniStyle right now.
Like I said, and I don't know why I do this, maybe as a service to the community or what, but I actually listen to every single Max remix that's submitted to Bomani.
And I'm afraid to say that nothing good has been recently submitted, sadly enough.
But there has been some good stuff.
I'm trying to remember who submitted it.
It was a...
There was a remix of Healing Vision that was actually pretty good.
It was like Healing Vision 2000.
And I can't remember who submitted that, but I'm looking that up right now.
Other than that, there was a few other sim files and a Stoic remix.
There was some other stuff.
What was it?
A... B4U remix, and that was okay.
But anyways, the guy I was talking about is...
Looks like Dokoro Rider, and he's got a bunch of cool sim files here, and you can go check them out.
You can actually, he's on the second or third page on there, and you'll see Healing Vision 2000.
You can just search under the author and pull up all of his files that he's made, and they're pretty good.
And then I was playing, I forget what other one, I think it was the last DDR Extreme UK release or something like that, or DDR...
I don't remember what it was, but anyways, it was, um, there were some videos, um, like, just, like, top 40 crap, and that was pretty cool, too, while I was playing those.
But, um, as far as anything major going on, nada.
Nothing from last week.
Nothing new.
Oh, I guess there's some stupid, uh, there's some contests going on for myself about Rizlam and making symbols for that in the remixes.
Yeah, but anyways, other than that, nothing.
Nothing else.
But definitely check out the sim files I recommended, and yeah, that's it.
Alrighty, well, sounds like the sim scene's kind of on vacation for Christmas there.
It's too bad about, I'm noticing a lot of Belmonte sites are down lately.
Jason was pointing a few out to me before the show.
They're GrooveStats, down.
DM Ashura, down.
So.
What can you do?
It happens.
Bandwidth kind of stinks.
Very interesting.
I'm surprised there are no official, or well, there isn't going to be official, but nobody has put together Ultramix 2 steps, files yet?
Nobody's done that?
DDRUK is on top of it.
They will be done soon.
I think they are done right now.
The problem with them is they have so many people working on submitting stuff.
They are like
Perfectionist when it comes to this stuff.
So they're not going to release it until it's perfect.
So, you know, that's good to know, but it will take a little longer to release.
That's all.
I remember, though, Loki, when DDR Max USA or something came out, you did a half-assed job.
It was pretty decent.
You had everything ripped.
You had the song.
You had the steps.
It worked for me.
You had it out within days.
But these guys, it's been a couple months now.
That's because I just don't give a damn anymore.
I could have had these out a couple days after it came out.
But I just don't give a damn because they have better ways of doing it now with Ultramix and on the Xbox.
There's actual ways they can rip the files straight from there.
So you get perfect music rips, perfect graphic rips.
I just am not interested anymore.
I don't really care about ripping files because I know someone will eventually do it.
And it's not a big deal to me.
I played them on the Xbox.
Whatever, I don't really care anymore.
Alright, well let's move on to the FUs of the week, shall we?
This is the part of the show where we get a little bit ranty.
And this is the part where I would ask Jamie, why is it that we do the FUs every week?
And she would say something like, because we're not going to take it anymore.
Oh, this is bad.
Here is just too bad.
Obviously, DarkSakura is not here tonight.
She's sick.
We hope she gets better soon.
So, on DarkSakura's behalf, I will give an FU to viruses and diseases that won't go away and things that ruin your Christmas season because you're sick.
Does that sound pretty fair?
Oh, and because DarkSakura usually has the FU to stupid drivers, FU to unruly children's parents, and FU to stupid people that call her at work.
That about wrap it up?
Sounds good to me.
Let's move on to Loki.
Okay.
First off...
I just wasn't winning today at all.
Then there's the people that don't fucking look where they're going.
and they just turn in front of you and they're like, oh, you hit me, that's your fault, I'm going, because I have my truck, and I support push, therefore I'm going.
I don't know, whatever, they're stupid, that and the stupid jaywalkers, they're like, oh, I almost got hit, well, you know, you should maybe cross the crosswalk, around a corner, maybe follow some traffic laws, yeah.
Um, fuck you to Folsom Police for not being where they need to be.
When I see all these people breaking the law as far as turning left on, you know, right turn only, you know, lanes and stuff like that, and they're fucking just never there, but oh, damn, sure, as soon as you start... Heaven forbid you run a stoplight in front of the Krispy Kreme.
Heaven forbid that happen, you know, then you're fucked.
But anyways, also, fuck you to the lack of pants.
I need more pants.
I'm running low on pants, and that makes me sad.
All I got this year for Christmas was shirts.
when I need pants to go with those shirts.
So, goddammit, no pants makes me sad.
And, um, also, fuck you to the lack of parties in Final Fantasy XI because I have to wait for hours at a time playing my, um, Mario 64 on my DS while waiting, you know, to get a party because it's taking forever.
And retarded people, because retarded people must play online games for some reason.
Somehow they make it through.
Much like society where, you know, some people somehow make it through our education system despite the fact they're retarded.
I guess we need someone to flip the burgers then, don't we?
Man, I'm all done.
I'm all done.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'd like to put an F you out to the chair that collapsed under the weight of my own ass.
I'd like to put an F you out to Walmart for producing that chair.
I'd like to give you an F you to myself for shopping at Walmart when I purchased that chair.
I'd like to give an F you to Best Buy.
What the fuck kind of store doesn't have shopping carts when I need them?
I asked if I could have a shopping cart and they looked at me like I was a damn foreigner speaking another language.
I've seen shopping carts at Best Buys before.
Oh, I know why you don't have any shopping carts right now.
Because you're putting all your fucking clearance items in there.
You guys sell tables?
Put all the clearance items on a table and let me have the damn shopping cart.
Because of your ass, I had to carry that chair to Loki's car.
And that was not fair.
and also F you to the fact that there was nobody around willing to help me out so when I walked over to the other department I found another guy I said hey could you help me get this chair and he's just like uh well that's not my department let me see if I can find somebody who can help you so I went over to the other department my department is like about an inch away from where you're at you see if you look at the markings on the floor
This is the car stereo department in the blue area, okay?
And where you are, in the white area, that's home furnishings.
This is my department, and you're in that department, okay?
So I can't help you, even though I'm five feet away from you, okay?
Okay, sorry.
Sorry.
So I finally had to go over to the dishwasher area to get some guy to help me.
And he was kind enough to get up on the ladder, bring down the chair for me, and he even rung it up right there so I didn't have to stand in that atrocious line.
And the chair only cost half as much as we thought it would.
So thank you to that guy.
And unfortunately I did not catch the guy's name, but I will know him in the future because he's the only black guy I've ever seen working at a Best Buy.
Ever.
Also, I'd like to give an FU to the fact that I have to go back to work tomorrow, because that's no fair.
And I'd like to give an FU to Nintendo for putting out a DS before they had any really good games really available for it.
And FU to Ping Pals, because...
The following views are the expressed views of me, Dark Child, and are not at all endorsed by Orange Lounge Radio.
Fuck you to Daniel.
I don't know, you're not on these forums or nothing.
I don't think you listen, so I don't give a fuck.
Fuck you.
You know, you say you know what the fuck I'm going through and how the fuck you do this shit to someone.
Fuck you, man.
I fucking despise you.
You went after a woman who had a man.
Fuck you.
Fuck you to my mother for giving me a shitty ass gift.
You know, she gave me calling cards.
Because I racked up a phone bill with my girlfriend a month ago, you know, about $600 to $800 phone bill.
So I get calling cards for Christmas.
She bought them three days after my girlfriend broke up with me.
So, uh, fuck you, mom.
Nice gift.
Fuck you to some stupid ass on FilePlanet who posted up my friend's GTA San Andreas, or GTA Vice City video, as though it was GTA San Andreas video made in Legos, and taking credit for doing it himself instead of my friend doing it.
and also fuck you to FilePlanet because that video was posted and now BrickFlick.com has gone over bandwidth so I can't even check that site out.
And finally, fuck you to the turn of events that have occurred in my life.
I thought I had more time to change things, apparently I don't, so fuck you to life in general.
That's all.
Have a nice day.
Alrighty, let's move on then to the chatroom FUs.
Ah, DDR Angel says, F you to having no internet from Wednesday to Saturday, F you to being sicker than hell on Christmas, and F you to not being able to spend time with my friends on Christmas, but I was with you all in spirit.
Sorry, hairball.
Outphase would like to say, fuck you to DDR Extreme USA.
Dark Knight says, F you to too much damn Christmas movies all week long.
I mean, I'm tired of a Christmas story.
24 hours.
Damn.
You know what, I agree.
A Christmas Story, one of the greatest Christmas, if not movies, but Christmas movies of all time.
We used to watch it every Christmas Eve, but god damn has that movie been played out.
It's time for them to make a sequel or a remake or do a new Christmas movie that we can all relate to with a dysfunctional family.
Jaded2004 says, F you to the person who wished for a white Christmas, cause we got two feet of snow.
And DJ Ranma S says, A giant F you to the fuckhead that tried to kick my ass at work.
Ha ha ha, sucks to be you, cause your ass is behind bars.
By the way, from this Best Buy employee, fuck you all.
Smirk.
Jerk.
Alright, that's it.
Pretty short on the FUs tonight.
Oh, there might be a couple more.
Actually, I don't think so.
I think that's about it.
Oh, no, Outphase wanted to add a fuck you to DDR Freak for no good reason, apparently.
So just a general FU.
I guess he was banned, I don't know.
Then I'll just add a for no reason a fuck you to Jason Coe, and I don't know why.
Aren't you kind and generous and full of love?
You know this show is played on DDR Freak occasionally?
Isn't that kind of shooting us in the foot there, you dumbass?
I gave a disclaimer about my statements already.
Loki?
There's a new quest in Final Fantasy XI that they just started after the Christen event ended with goblins that ride chocobos.
Who cares? !
Alright, BigRedPimp has a late FU that I'm just now getting.
FU to Nintendo for making the DS $20 more than how much money I got for Christmas.
Oh, that's too bad.
Sucks to be you.
Now I'm getting all these FUs.
You guys are late.
You're tardy.
Sign in, please.
Misty says I can't be in an FU mood because I got to play in the group today.
and Outface says there was no reason behind his FU to DDR Freak.
He's just bored.
And I know when I'm bored, I just sit here and think to myself, God, fuck DDR Freak.
I mean, they ruined my life.
I don't get it.
Dark Child.
I understand, you know.
I just throw out fuck you's to random people at times.
Shut the fuck up!
Fuck you, Rob.
I'm just saying fuck on the radio because I can.
On that note, I think it's a very good time to go to a break.
What do you guys think?
You guys don't fucking care.
Alright, we're going to go to a break.
When we come back, more randomness here on Orange Lounge Radio.
In this break, since I think it seems appropriate, we're going to do some music from DDR Extreme USA.
How's that sound?
Tee hee.
And we'll be back after this.
A bit of music.
Enjoy.
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Love, real love, love, love, love, simply be love, love, love, love, love, love, simply be
Simply be in love, yeah, yeah Simply be in love, yeah, yeah Simply be in love, yeah, yeah Simply be in love, yeah Simply be in love, yeah Simply be in love It's more than enough Simply be in love It's more than enough
Simply enough, is more than enough, yeah You touched my body once, it burned
Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music
We are back here on Orange Launch Radio.
We've got about a half hour of show left to kill here.
What are we going to do?
Show up and support Orange Lounge Radio.
It happens.
What kind of stuff are you looking at over there, Loki?
I noticed you were reading something about... Now, this has nothing to do with Bomani, but a lot of people say ZSNes.
Oh, the first release in two and a half years for ZSNes has been released with a bunch of, like, fixes and crap.
So I was just checking that out.
I was just reading Slashdot, because that's what I do.
And they have an article.
They had one that's at the very bottom of the page, actually, that's about overclocking a Nintendo...
Yes, you can overclock an NES.
Why the fuck would you want to overclock an NES?
You know, an NES is beyond me.
They did mention, though, there are some games, though, that lagged out normally.
You can play them without lag now.
But other games just fuck up.
But that was the best part about the Nintendo system, was the games that glitched out.
We would get games dirty just to play them so they would glitch out, and it's like a whole new challenge.
Akari Warriors, man, so many hours of entertainment played, you know, just from that game glitching out.
Oh, hey, look, Player One just fell behind the backdrop, now he's running underneath everything.
It was so much fun, it was just crazy.
Why didn't you just start putting random codes in the game, Genie?
I did that with Ninja Gaiden.
It was cool.
The game worked fine when I was running and shooting ninja stars and stuff.
But the moment I jumped, I went under the stage and somehow flew to the end of the stage, but still under the ground.
There's just so much shit that's glitched out.
Those are the days.
Now we have these new games that don't glitch... Well, okay, I can't say they don't glitch out that much.
I mean...
Driver 3.
That's enough said.
That game is so awful.
I need to play some Driver 3 tonight.
I've decided.
I've got to go back and play that game just because it's so bad and so glitchy that it's worth it.
Oh, and there's another thing here.
You know how they have all those free iPod links?
I'm really curious about this article.
I'm looking on Slashdot.
I'm actually clicking on it, trying to find out more about what's going on here because I know this is a big thing going on right now.
And on all the DDR sites, you see it in people's signatures.
Win a free iPod.
Or not win, but sign up for this crap and get a free iPod.
Sign up for this and that and get a free iPod.
But it's actually worked.
We know people that have gotten free iPods because of it, so you can't deny that the system works.
I'm kind of wondering what I'm seeing here on Slashdot about.
What is this?
They're saying there's fine print or something.
Are they going to have to give the iPods back?
What's going on?
Are they going to charge credit card unknowingly or something?
What's going on?
No, I'm making that stuff up.
But I'm kind of curious.
What's the hidden message here on the iPod thing?
Now, granted, I myself, I wanted an iPod.
I just ended up buying one.
It was a Christmas present to myself.
Whereas I probably could have done the refer six friends and get one thing.
I get nervous about that kind of stuff
It's just too good to be true.
You know what I mean?
It's just too damn good to be true.
There's got to be something hidden.
And even though I have no right to think that because I know people that have done this and have gotten away with it, I just... What the hell?
Any thoughts, Loki?
Have you been able to find anything on this?
No.
I don't really care.
I don't do these.
I don't, you know... I just don't buy this stuff.
And I really, you know...
Free money?
Free money!
Free money for doing this iPhone thing.
In fact, this person right here was just saying on this one link that they had on there, that was saying, just wanted to add one more thing.
I got off the phone with my girlfriend.
She received a $500 gift card from IRC a few days ago.
Now she's $550 richer.
I think I can say with absolute certainty that the Incentive Rewards Center is both legitimate and attentive to their customers.
I don't know what the fuck the...
The, um, whatever, the IRC Incentive Rewards Center, whatever But, um, I don't know, whatever, I mean If you want to go ahead and risk it and try to get free shit, just know for a fact And this is pure economics, nothing in life is free
Does it say in the small print, like somebody's suggesting in the chatroom here, I think it's Moo in the chatroom right now, says, I think people are unknowingly selling their souls for those free iPods.
Is there something in the small print about having to give up your soul?
Because seriously, where are they?
I mean, I understand where they're making the money.
They're making their money off the people that can only refer four friends and can't get that fifth friend, as frustrating as it must be to them or whatever.
That's where they're making their money, but I don't know.
What I think it is, is they're not paying some kind of research firm to give them a bunch of email addresses.
Instead, it's much cheaper than just give out iPods to get the email addresses.
But everybody's giving a fake email address.
Everybody I know who's done this hasn't used their real email address.
So, you know, I don't know.
Weird, weird stuff.
Alright, well, maybe one day I'll participate in one of these Get Rich Quick schemes for the sake of the show, and I'll let you know how it goes.
It's kind of funny though, we're having all this chatting about iPods because of something that I'm not going to talk about right now.
But it's just interesting that we're having all this talk about iPods.
Yes, it was creative foreshadowing.
Alright, now people think we're going to be giving away iPods.
No, sorry, we don't have the budget for that, sorry.
Why would we subject you to those horrible devices?
I have an iPod, and I like my iPod.
It's cool.
It does bang up a little easy, though, because you'll notice now, granted, I don't have a protective case or anything, and I do take this to my car with me, but you'll notice there's already little scratches that are showing up on the screen, and look at this.
Look at this.
Right there, where the dot meets the wheel there, a little bit of stripping there of the cheap plastic.
iPods are like Korean whores to me.
I'm not touching them because they're dirty!
Wow.
You know what though?
I figure that now the chat room is all teasing me because I went and bought an iPod and I could have gotten a free one.
But you know what?
It felt good to walk into the Apple store and walk in there and lay my credit card down and go, Daddy wants an iPod today.
Can you gift wrap it for me so I can take it home and open it up and make it feel like it's Christmas?
I don't know.
Now we've started this war about all these other multimedia devices that are supposedly better than iPods.
You know what?
That's great.
That's just fabulous.
Have fun with your devices.
I am more than happy with my freaking iPod.
Thank you.
You know what rocks?
It's the greatest thing ever.
It's called an MP3C player.
Okay, you put it in your car, and you can burn MP3s to a disc, and you can play like hours and hours of stuff.
And guess what?
They only cost like $20!
Don't buy the iPod.
Do not subject yourself to something that looks cute.
Cuteness does not mean functional.
I need to interrupt here for a minute.
I had the MP3 CD player in my car.
It worked for a week, and then it didn't work anymore.
That's why they're so cheap, because they don't fucking work.
And you burn them, and then they skip all the time because you have them sitting on the seat, or wherever I would stick that thing, it would skip, skip, skip, skip, because MP3 CDs just... Bullshit!
No, you're bullshit!
Those CD players have like a two-minute skip time.
You'd have to literally throw it out of a plane for it to skip.
Hey, speaking of iPods, did they ever fix the battery problem with the iPods?
Because if not, you're going to get like 16 months use out of it, and you're screwed.
You're fucked.
Supposedly, yes, they fixed the battery problem with the iPods, but this is why I bought my iPod at the official Apple store, so that if anything goes wrong with it, I will take it back and demand a new one.
But the battery life, it could be better.
Ah!
Well, seeing as the dude's got the official response from Apple's customer service saying that he had to purchase a brand new one or a refurbed one because they don't have replacement batteries and they won't replace them, I don't think buying it from the Apple store will matter.
No, from what I understand, they do the replacement battery thing now.
They do that.
And I know that they, I asked about it and they said that they sell the batteries or something like that now.
So, suck it.
Big old untrue rumor for 2005 DDR game coming to the N-Gage.
Oh, N-Gage best-selling game system ever also.
Just so you know.
What?
I said untrue.
Is somebody actually proclaiming this, that N-Gage is best-selling system ever?
No.
What's that dumb?
I was going to say, tell me who they are so I can point and laugh at them appropriately, please.
Thank you.
All right.
Um... You know what?
I'm thinking we ought to just end the damn show.
You want to play music?
What music do you want to play?
I'll just play some of those remixes that I downloaded earlier.
Because they're cool.
Anyways.
Um, some of the songs I was telling you about, you know, earlier, the sim files and whatnot.
Um, some cool shit that's out there.
Um, let's see...
Well, we've got... Healing Vision 2000, which is pretty good.
Pretty good.
I don't know if this is the actual name for it, because this guy, DokuRider or whatever, he does take a lot of songs, though, that are not his, and renames them, but makes sim files for them.
I think he's foreign, so he doesn't know what the names of the songs are, so he just kind of makes one up.
But anyways, you might be finding them on online file sharing sites.
But...
Anyways, we're going to start off with Healing Vision 2000, and I'll try that one, so it's pretty cool.
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
That was pretty cool.
Now, some other things I just, you know, listening to that reminded me.
I forgot to mention the new stuff coming to you from Diverse Systems.
And there's a lot of stuff actually to mention.
Four new albums were announced this week.
Starting off with D8, which is the brand new Diversisms album.
Album on your remixes, two to set.
That should be coming out pretty soon.
And we're actually going to play some of those.
I haven't listened to these new ones though that we're going to play, so it should be interesting.
This first one is an Ecstasy remix called, let's see here, what was the title?
It was Ecstasy Fly Air Heaven is the name of that.
So I'll have to check this one out real quick here, let's see.
Dear Mr. Taka, Dear Mr. Desire,
So it should be pretty good, all talking music I would assume.
A new one also they're going to be working on, which is Diverse vs. Capcom, which should be pretty sweet.
All remixes of your favorite side-scroller fighters.
And then also there's another title they announced, which is...
Fujitsu, which I believe is actually just one of the artists.
The guy that did the remix of the Safari.
Remember that one that's in Food Mix?
He did that.
Oh, God.
Well, we have to listen to this.
We'll listen to this next, but it's one of Rob's nightmares come alive.
Jesus, what?
So anyways, the next one, like I said, Gentle Stress.
So...
Okay, but the creme de la creme of the Fujitsu one, we teased about this last week, I believe, maybe even worse than that, when Rob was mentioning, God, I hate those stupid sim files, you know, they're a cross between songs.
Well, this one, max 321 stars.
Sadly enough, it was made.
Go a little further into the file here.
Let's hear a different part.
It just has that back beat running through the whole thing.
Finding another part?
Was that it?
I think that was it.
Some things just shouldn't be done.
I don't care if it's by a really great Japanese remixing group, and I'm sure the guy's done some other really good files, but, uh... Jeez!
Alright, what's this?
This is some other stuff.
I don't really know what this is.
Love is Eternity, Original Extended Mix.
Yeah, it is a Chorus K album.
They're also going to be distributing the Chorus K album, looks like.
So, yeah, lots of good stuff coming to you from Diverse Systems.
Unfortunately, they have not updated their goddamn English page, so we can't order any of this unless you're in Japan.
That fucking sucks.
But that's the way life goes, I guess.
Thank you very much for tuning in tonight.
We're going to go around and get... Oh, yeah, DarkShadow, do you have another thought here?
Once again, anyone who could offer me advice, email address dchild999 at yahoo.com.
That's d-c-h-y-l-d-e-9-9-9 at yahoo.com.
And if you forget that address, just go give a shout out on the forums and Dark Child will find you and take you under his wing and breastfeed you.
No, I'm just kidding.
All right.
All right.
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts of the day.
Dark Child, your final thoughts.
die Daniel, die Loki, your final thought I'm full and tired
And my final thought is, I don't care if it's a few minutes early, we're spent.
So, good night everybody.
The final word of the show, one word to sum it all up.
We're going to give, as soon as I queue up the actual outro to the show, which would be a good idea.
The final word of the show that will sum it all up, we're going to give it to the one, the only, DarkSakura.
So think of one word that's going to sum it all up for you and the show.
But also we do hope, DarkSakura, if you're out there listening somewhere, although you might be asleep by now, I don't know, hope you feel better.
Feel better soon.
The show just isn't the same without you, trust me.
and we'll see you guys next week hopefully DarkSakura will be back and we'll have plenty of New Year's Eve stories to be telling you guys be safe this New Year's have a great rest of your 2004 you guys and we'll see you in 2005 and now with the final word of the day Dark Child Chance
And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sensimia Street?
How to get to Sensimia Street?
How to get to Sensimia Street?
Hello, Kermit the Frog here, and welcome to Sensimia Street.
I'd like to tell you what today's letter is, but I am really f***ed up.
Hey, Big Bird, do you know what today's letter is?
Sure, Kermit.
Today's letter is... Joint.
Uh, Big Bird, joint is not a letter.
It is a word.
Sorry, kids.
Today's letter is three.
Hmm, Big Bird, uh...
Three is a number.
Exactly.
The number three, which is how many joints I've smoked today.
Kermit, are you with me?
Thank God I'm stoned.
Me too.
Guys, guys, show go on.
Come on.
Thank you, Elmo.
How about we say our ABCs, Big Bird?
Okay.
A, B, C, D, E, F, R, G, Q, K, C, R, Z, F,
I forgot what we were doing, Kramit.
Did you just call me Kramit?
Yes, I did.
Kramity Frog here.
Okay, okay.
That's all the time we have for today.
Goodbye, kids.
Today's show was brought to you by the letter... Bong.
And the number...
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
Orange Lounge Radio Afterbirth, the part after the credits have faded to black and we're still here wanting attention from you guys.
You know what?
We literally only had not even half the usual listeners that we've had.
I swear to God, we better start seeing an increase in people coming back to the station or we're quitting.
It's quitting time.
I'm just making empty threats.
I don't know what we can do about it.
I guess just because it's the holidays.
But man, that was a sad turnout tonight, you guys.
Cry, cry, cry.
I'm very upset with you all.
Loki, any final post-credit things you wanted to get out?
No.
I'm tired.
I just feel drained.
All that food.
I don't know.
9.30.
That's three and a half hours of party time.
That's what I thought.
Addict.
Although I'm thinking very similar thoughts here.
But yeah, I've just eaten so much I just want to curl into the bed and take a big fat cat nap.
Emphasis on fat.
I got new flannel sheets for Christmas and they're comfy.
They're very comfy.
Your flat lice made me sleepy.
Mine too, and I don't know, all that's in it, okay, that's in my fried rice is just, you know, rice, obviously, steamed rice, egg, lots of garlic, lots of butter, lots of soy sauce, and pork.
I don't know which one of those made me tired.
That was pork?
I don't eat pork.
Oh well.
Don't!
At least I'm not Muslim, so I'm not going to hell.
Oh well, it was tasty pork.
So yeah, I don't know.
I fucking hate my printer.
I have to get new cartridges for it and they're so tiny that they run out in like an hour and they're like 20 bucks each.
I tried to print on your printer yesterday and it wouldn't work so I just said fuck it because I bought tickets on Fandango.
For one, you don't need to bring the ticket thing.
Two, it's not hooked up to my computer anymore because I unplugged it for the extra long USB cable that was plugged in this God knows what else.
I don't know, something else.
And, um... Antidote bank, anyways.
So, you're screwed three times.
Well, shit.
I need to play more Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.
I need to play more DDR.
I need to play anything in general.
My friend and I beat San Andreas within three days with, uh,
40 hours and then we beat it 100% three days later.
I'm cheating.
The entire way.
It makes it so much, you know, so much better.
And have you ever been on a motorcycle?
I kid you not.
This happened to me twice.
I was on a motorcycle driving through the country and a plane crashes into me!
Oh yeah, yeah, that happens all the time.
We had walked out of one of our casinos in Vegas and a plane just flew right into the side of the building right next to the door.
It's pretty cool.
Now what you need to try is get into the two-player mode and start a kiss.
Have the first player kiss player two, and player two then hit triangle to get in the vehicle.
And then just watch what happens.
There are a lot of messed up glitches in that game, and that's one of the craziest.
Or the one where you can actually cut the other person's head off, and then they're just running headless throughout the whole game.
Or go ride the mountain bike off the top of the...
mount with a parachute to get that out or you could just hold your brake and pedal with the mountain bike and suddenly you get sucked into the middle of the world.
I love games.
They're glitchy.
Those are the best ones.
The new one that I found out was when you could fly into the other world where all the rooms exist, you gotta go into a gym and use the rocket pack code, kill everyone in the gym, go into a dark corner of the gym and fly straight up
and there'll be a yellow marker to the south of you and you can go into that and then suddenly you're in the tattoo parlor that should be in San André or San Piero that's not so you can get the third set of tattoos and then you can go to all the other interiors in the game.
Sweet.
Alright, I think that's enough.
I agree.
I'm falling asleep over here.
So have a great night everybody.
Thank you very much to those of you guys that tuned in tonight.
We do appreciate your support.
Please continue to support Orange Launch Radio.
Have a great night.
