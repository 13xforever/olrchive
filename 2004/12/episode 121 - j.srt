00:02:30,746 --> 00:02:32,807
[SPEAKER_13]: No, you can't let them keep you.

20
00:02:32,867 --> 00:02:33,667
[SPEAKER_13]: They all had grits.

21
00:02:35,243 --> 00:02:37,844
[SPEAKER_05]: I ate at the Waffle House!

22
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:41,126

00:02:41,206 --> 00:02:41,706
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

33
00:03:19,716 --> 00:03:21,157
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a very happy hello, isn't it?

34
00:03:22,423 --> 00:03:22,843
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, it is.

35
00:03:23,263 --> 00:03:24,984
[SPEAKER_12]: And also say hello to Arcadian42.

36
00:03:25,024 --> 00:03:25,604
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi.

37
00:03:28,505 --> 00:03:28,765
[SPEAKER_12]: What?

38
00:03:31,826 --> 00:03:33,687
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I want to talk about that when we come back.

39
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:34,407
[SPEAKER_12]: That is crazy.

40
00:03:34,947 --> 00:03:37,788
[SPEAKER_12]: Because we just had an 80s pre-show and it kind of ties into that.

41
00:03:37,828 --> 00:03:39,029
[SPEAKER_12]: That little thing you're playing right there.

42
00:03:40,711 --> 00:03:43,394
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, we got a whole lot of interesting stuff to talk about tonight.

43
00:03:43,474 --> 00:03:44,274
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, I'm lying.

44
00:03:44,454 --> 00:03:48,057
[SPEAKER_12]: There's really not a whole lot going on, but we're going to try to film three hours best we can anyway.

45
00:03:49,898 --> 00:03:54,462
[SPEAKER_12]: I know I want to talk about 8 Style tonight, Pop Music 10, because I got to play both those this week for the first time.

46
00:03:54,862 --> 00:04:00,427
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course, How's Your Week, How's Your Day, Cage Match, all that fun stuff when we come back after this break featuring...

47
00:04:01,247 --> 00:04:04,530
[SPEAKER_12]: Music from DDR Third Mix, because Third Mix was cool.

48
00:04:05,151 --> 00:04:07,833
[SPEAKER_12]: If you want to join us in our chat room, there's quite a little crowd there already.

49
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:11,816
[SPEAKER_12]: Head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on chat.

50
00:04:12,697 --> 00:04:13,438
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll be right back.

51
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:14,999
[SPEAKER_12]: After this, boys and girls.

52
00:04:18,382 --> 00:04:21,685
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.

53
00:04:22,422 --> 00:04:26,464
[SPEAKER_13]: Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bomani Music and More program.

54
00:04:26,505 --> 00:04:27,465
[SPEAKER_13]: Can we talk about that?

55
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:30,047
[SPEAKER_06]: No subject will ever be taboo.

56
00:04:30,327 --> 00:04:33,949
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I was thinking maybe we should move Pump Up the Volume from Tuesday Nights.

57
00:04:34,469 --> 00:04:36,991
[SPEAKER_13]: Except, of course, a subject that was just under discussion.

58
00:04:37,491 --> 00:04:42,794
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?

59
00:04:43,354 --> 00:04:44,615
[SPEAKER_06]: I collect your fucking head.

60
00:04:46,567 --> 00:04:48,068
[SPEAKER_13]: Just like this fucker here.

61
00:04:49,148 --> 00:04:52,810
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki?

62
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:56,452
[SPEAKER_13]: The hot thing on episode 69 was just a joke!

63
00:04:57,373 --> 00:05:03,776
[SPEAKER_13]: Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!

64
00:05:03,796 --> 00:05:08,699
[SPEAKER_09]: Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.

65
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:14,765
[SPEAKER_12]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

66
00:05:15,865 --> 00:05:18,265
[SPEAKER_12]: The lovely and wonderful Jamie there in that promo.

67
00:05:18,425 --> 00:05:19,366
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, sort of.

68
00:05:20,646 --> 00:05:21,886
[SPEAKER_12]: Ash played by Lucy Liu.

69
00:05:21,986 --> 00:05:22,286
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

70
00:05:22,626 --> 00:05:24,247
[SPEAKER_12]: You remember that a long time ago.

71
00:05:24,567 --> 00:05:31,128
[SPEAKER_12]: This was like probably the first year of Orange Lounge Radio, which it's sad that that could be considered retro, but it really is.

72
00:05:31,368 --> 00:05:40,490
[SPEAKER_12]: You remember way back during the first year of this program when somebody had talked about, I want to say it was Dark Tetsuya was somehow involved with this, brought up the casting of the Orange Lounge movie.

73
00:05:41,585 --> 00:05:45,388
[SPEAKER_12]: And they took votes in the chat room and they said that you should be played by Lucy Liu.

74
00:05:46,068 --> 00:05:46,909
[SPEAKER_05]: How ironic.

75
00:05:47,009 --> 00:05:48,290
[SPEAKER_12]: Which is, yeah, how ironic.

76
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,771
[SPEAKER_12]: A little too ironic.

77
00:05:50,071 --> 00:05:52,093
[SPEAKER_12]: Especially considering you're not Asian at all.

78
00:05:52,713 --> 00:05:52,913
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

79
00:05:54,414 --> 00:05:54,895
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

80
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:57,717
[SPEAKER_05]: I finally got something new when I went to Alabama.

81
00:05:58,297 --> 00:06:00,659
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be like me being played by Denzel Washington.

82
00:06:03,311 --> 00:06:04,011
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, sorry.

83
00:06:04,352 --> 00:06:04,972
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, Alabama?

84
00:06:05,072 --> 00:06:08,053
[SPEAKER_05]: I got, um, I believe it was, I thought you were taller.

85
00:06:09,434 --> 00:06:11,115
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, this is a good segue.

86
00:06:11,135 --> 00:06:15,537
[SPEAKER_12]: We've got to get into how was your week, how was your day, because I've got to figure out about what this is all about.

87
00:06:15,577 --> 00:06:16,718
[SPEAKER_12]: So, Jamie, how was your week, how was your day?

88
00:06:17,578 --> 00:06:20,120
[SPEAKER_05]: My couple of weeks were pretty decent.

89
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,821
[SPEAKER_05]: Very, very, very, very, very, very busy.

90
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:30,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, with my trip to Alabama, I got there, my mom got us lost and away from New Orleans.

91
00:06:31,275 --> 00:06:33,277
[SPEAKER_05]: We ended up heading up toward Hattiesburg.

92
00:06:34,918 --> 00:06:36,439
[SPEAKER_04]: There's something stuck in this thing.

93
00:06:36,459 --> 00:06:38,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, we ended up going up to Hattiesburg.

94
00:06:39,369 --> 00:06:42,692
[SPEAKER_05]: and then right when mom realized where we were we had to go around a different way so we headed home.

95
00:06:44,694 --> 00:06:46,836
[SPEAKER_05]: Got there, I didn't get in bed until 6 in the morning central.

96
00:06:47,837 --> 00:06:53,321
[SPEAKER_05]: That means I had been up an official 24 hours because I woke up at 4 pacific in the morning.

97
00:06:53,362 --> 00:06:53,942
[SPEAKER_12]: Congratulations.

98
00:06:55,443 --> 00:06:56,104
[SPEAKER_05]: My ass crashed.

99
00:06:57,225 --> 00:07:00,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Next day was Thanksgiving but we didn't do Thanksgiving stuff, we just slept.

100
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:06,131
[SPEAKER_05]: I did some hanging out, you know, it was pretty cool.

101
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:13,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Then on Friday I went to Dothan, saw my daddy, my Uncle Dale.

102
00:07:13,853 --> 00:07:16,054
[SPEAKER_05]: My Uncle Dale and my daddy are having their second childhoods.

103
00:07:16,774 --> 00:07:18,855
[SPEAKER_05]: My Uncle Dale has a... A.K.A.

104
00:07:18,895 --> 00:07:19,635
[SPEAKER_12]: midlife crisis.

105
00:07:20,335 --> 00:07:21,335
[SPEAKER_05]: 2004 Mustang GT.

106
00:07:22,136 --> 00:07:23,236
[SPEAKER_05]: My daddy has a Camaro.

107
00:07:25,757 --> 00:07:30,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, my daddy is cute on the internet, because they have this old 500 megahertz kind of crappy thing.

108
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:38,261
[SPEAKER_05]: And my daddy is so cute playing on it, because he just hunts and texts with little keys, and it's so cute.

109
00:07:38,701 --> 00:07:43,323
[SPEAKER_05]: And my daddy sends me everything in 72-point font and email.

110
00:07:45,044 --> 00:07:45,604
[SPEAKER_12]: It's adorable.

111
00:07:45,704 --> 00:07:47,504
[SPEAKER_12]: I used to be that way on AOL Instant Messenger.

112
00:07:47,525 --> 00:07:50,726
[SPEAKER_12]: I would type to everybody in huge 72-point font, and they'd be like, knock it off!

113
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:57,012
[SPEAKER_12]: But I figured my chats are very important, and I want to make sure they're not missed.

114
00:07:59,013 --> 00:08:06,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, so Saturday, we had our official Thanksgiving at my uncle's house, and we had fried turkey.

115
00:08:08,037 --> 00:08:08,638
[SPEAKER_05]: Mmm.

116
00:08:08,658 --> 00:08:09,878
[SPEAKER_13]: What about deep fried turkey?

117
00:08:09,938 --> 00:08:10,479
[SPEAKER_13]: Deep fried turkey.

118
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:12,359
[SPEAKER_13]: You know how dangerous that shit is to make?

119
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:13,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, but it's so yummy.

120
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:17,242
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, my uncle had a very nice deep fryer with a lid and everything.

121
00:08:18,596 --> 00:08:22,178
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was very gummy because it makes all of the meat just super juicy.

122
00:08:22,799 --> 00:08:24,520
[SPEAKER_05]: And it had all kinds of things that I'm not supposed to eat.

123
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,861
[SPEAKER_05]: On the way to Dothan, though, I had boiled peanuts.

124
00:08:27,762 --> 00:08:30,663
[SPEAKER_05]: And I passed by two movie galleries and saluted them for you, Loki.

125
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:33,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, the single finger salute.

126
00:08:33,745 --> 00:08:36,207
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

127
00:08:38,128 --> 00:08:39,729
[SPEAKER_05]: But I had a really good time.

128
00:08:39,749 --> 00:08:42,751
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that night, I went to Ground Zero.

129
00:08:43,735 --> 00:08:50,739
[SPEAKER_05]: which is a comic book store with gaming tables.

130
00:08:51,099 --> 00:08:54,661
[SPEAKER_05]: There were lots of people playing Yu-Gi-Oh and I felt really nerdy.

131
00:08:54,882 --> 00:08:57,683
[SPEAKER_05]: But downstairs there was an arcade there.

132
00:08:57,723 --> 00:08:58,304
[SPEAKER_05]: It was pretty cool.

133
00:08:58,324 --> 00:09:02,446
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a very strange name for an arcade in light of recent events.

134
00:09:03,307 --> 00:09:03,927
[SPEAKER_12]: Isn't it great?

135
00:09:04,908 --> 00:09:05,288
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

136
00:09:06,388 --> 00:09:08,530
[SPEAKER_05]: But there was...

137
00:09:10,714 --> 00:09:14,015
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

138
00:09:34,082 --> 00:09:34,603
[SPEAKER_05]: I met Dork.

139
00:09:34,683 --> 00:09:34,803
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

140
00:09:55,539 --> 00:09:56,920
[SPEAKER_05]: I met quite a few people.

141
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,522
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I met the... I'm supposing that he's in charge of the machines there.

142
00:10:01,742 --> 00:10:03,863
[SPEAKER_05]: He goes by Pyramus Online.

143
00:10:04,703 --> 00:10:05,824
[SPEAKER_05]: Very, very cool guy.

144
00:10:05,924 --> 00:10:07,904
[SPEAKER_05]: I went to a... I went to a Bomani party!

145
00:10:08,305 --> 00:10:08,505
[SPEAKER_12]: What?

146
00:10:09,005 --> 00:10:10,365
[SPEAKER_12]: You went to a Bomani party?

147
00:10:10,546 --> 00:10:11,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

148
00:10:11,546 --> 00:10:13,667
[SPEAKER_12]: You just randomly got invited to a Bomani party down there?

149
00:10:13,687 --> 00:10:18,849
[SPEAKER_05]: They were all heading over, so I went over and played 8th Style on a widescreen TV, and that was rad.

150
00:10:18,989 --> 00:10:19,649
[SPEAKER_13]: Very nice.

151
00:10:19,709 --> 00:10:20,530
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you just...

152
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:23,336
[SPEAKER_12]: You went over to strangers' houses to play video games?

153
00:10:23,376 --> 00:10:27,466
[SPEAKER_05]: We actually lived about a block away from where my ex-roommates lived.

154
00:10:28,488 --> 00:10:29,471
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was very close.

155
00:10:30,289 --> 00:10:40,474
[SPEAKER_05]: and I went over, of course, to hang out with my mama's son and my papa's son and K-Kitty and Bobby and we had a pretty good time.

156
00:10:40,794 --> 00:10:41,674
[SPEAKER_05]: We watched movies.

157
00:10:42,155 --> 00:10:47,317
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw the end of The Day After Tomorrow and no offense, but that movie sucks.

158
00:10:48,478 --> 00:10:52,500
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think... That's my very professional opinion.

159
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,160
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know a lot of people who are going to disagree with you there.

160
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,061
[SPEAKER_05]: My mom loves the movie.

161
00:10:55,301 --> 00:10:55,941
[SPEAKER_05]: They love the movie.

162
00:10:56,321 --> 00:10:59,223
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really want to put down anyone else's opinion of it, but my opinion of it is crap.

163
00:11:04,376 --> 00:11:07,605
[SPEAKER_05]: I learned the fine art of DVD duplication.

164
00:11:08,988 --> 00:11:11,730
[SPEAKER_05]: and so I was able to deliver a copy of Kill Bill Volume 2.

165
00:11:12,111 --> 00:11:13,652
[SPEAKER_12]: Orange Launchator does not advocate piracy.

166
00:11:13,692 --> 00:11:16,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes it does.

167
00:11:17,014 --> 00:11:28,243
[SPEAKER_05]: And I got, actually you know there's that show Kindred the Embraced that came on based off of the White Wolf Universe and I have all the episodes they ever made of that because I think that the actor died.

168
00:11:29,124 --> 00:11:30,625
[SPEAKER_05]: The main guy who's playing the prince.

169
00:11:32,446 --> 00:11:34,148
[SPEAKER_05]: But I have all of that.

170
00:11:34,168 --> 00:11:37,050
[SPEAKER_05]: I still have it on my, if anyone brings me DVDs you'll get copies.

171
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:41,418
[SPEAKER_12]: Um... Orange Sounds Radio does not advocate piracy.

172
00:11:41,969 --> 00:11:44,510
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually, they're not... I'm just teasing.

173
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:46,250
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not licensed right now.

174
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:50,591
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I want to find out more about this Bomani party, because basically you went over to a stranger's house.

175
00:11:51,471 --> 00:11:52,471
[SPEAKER_13]: I sang, Rob.

176
00:11:52,531 --> 00:11:55,412
[SPEAKER_13]: People that stalk us on the internet, right?

177
00:11:55,512 --> 00:11:57,913
[SPEAKER_13]: Are these people our listeners?

178
00:11:57,973 --> 00:12:01,173
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, okay, so message to our listeners, stalking us works.

179
00:12:01,873 --> 00:12:06,374
[SPEAKER_13]: And, uh... I was hanging out with a lot of... A lot of the people, though, were people from DDR Freak.

180
00:12:06,675 --> 00:12:07,355
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, no, that's cool.

181
00:12:07,595 --> 00:12:08,235
[SPEAKER_12]: But, I mean, you got...

182
00:12:09,235 --> 00:12:12,918
[SPEAKER_12]: You've got the moderatorship on DDR Freak, so a lot of people know who you are over there.

183
00:12:14,619 --> 00:12:20,824
[SPEAKER_12]: The show's getting pretty big over there, thanks to the syndication on Friday nights over there on Freak Radio.

184
00:12:21,164 --> 00:12:22,545
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just a bunch of people.

185
00:12:22,585 --> 00:12:23,746
[SPEAKER_05]: I met a lot of good people.

186
00:12:25,747 --> 00:12:28,369
[SPEAKER_05]: We basically were just playing 8th style.

187
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:31,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, we brought out Karaoke Revolution.

188
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,352
[SPEAKER_13]: Now you don't sing karaoke.

189
00:12:34,492 --> 00:12:37,815
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't, but I got the line from Adventures in Babysitting.

190
00:12:38,696 --> 00:12:40,718
[SPEAKER_13]: Nobody leaves without singing the blues.

191
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,961
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's all it took?

192
00:12:44,001 --> 00:12:45,883
[SPEAKER_13]: They didn't have to feed you Guinness or anything?

193
00:12:45,903 --> 00:12:46,344
[SPEAKER_13]: I was begged.

194
00:12:47,594 --> 00:12:49,315
[SPEAKER_13]: They didn't make you drink Guinness or anything?

195
00:12:49,516 --> 00:12:50,756
[SPEAKER_13]: You just did it perfectly sober?

196
00:12:50,776 --> 00:12:53,838
[SPEAKER_13]: I just figured it was going to be about another year before I'm back.

197
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,781
[SPEAKER_12]: And you knew that there were no recording devices present, so... So I sang Bizarre Love Triangle.

198
00:12:58,861 --> 00:12:59,642
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, no, that's a good song.

199
00:13:00,022 --> 00:13:00,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

200
00:13:00,622 --> 00:13:03,184
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, see, you missed some karaoke action here on the show last week.

201
00:13:03,644 --> 00:13:04,365
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I didn't miss it.

202
00:13:04,405 --> 00:13:04,805
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

203
00:13:06,826 --> 00:13:07,086
[SPEAKER_12]: Thing.

204
00:13:07,206 --> 00:13:07,606
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

205
00:13:10,548 --> 00:13:14,871
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I actually, I was really... Loki's still pissed at me over it, by the way.

206
00:13:16,115 --> 00:13:44,829
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually was going to be trying to tune in on my laptop, but I had promised my mama-son I was going to take her to see The Grudge, which after having, since I was glad I saw Ju-on first, very glad I saw it first, because then, it was neat noting the differences in the movie, I'm not going to spoil it for anyone who hasn't, and actually, the thing that pissed me off is that I don't know the reason why they think they have to explain every single last fucking detail to a US audience.

207
00:13:45,572 --> 00:13:48,854
[SPEAKER_05]: When it's the not knowing that is the messed up part of the movie.

208
00:13:49,654 --> 00:13:51,195
[SPEAKER_05]: Even so, I thought it was very good.

209
00:13:52,096 --> 00:13:55,818
[SPEAKER_05]: And even better, especially since it was done by the original director.

210
00:13:57,139 --> 00:13:59,640
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, we did that.

211
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,181
[SPEAKER_05]: I went to Steak and Shake.

212
00:14:01,581 --> 00:14:03,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Steak and Shake is the best place ever.

213
00:14:03,182 --> 00:14:03,462
[SPEAKER_12]: What?

214
00:14:04,303 --> 00:14:05,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Steak and Shake.

215
00:14:05,043 --> 00:14:07,885
[SPEAKER_12]: Only in the South, which you have a place called Steak and Shake.

216
00:14:08,185 --> 00:14:10,106
[SPEAKER_05]: It's these thick hamburgers, really good.

217
00:14:10,226 --> 00:14:11,947
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a little diner type place.

218
00:14:12,327 --> 00:14:14,849
[SPEAKER_05]: But you can get these humongous milkshakes and they make a half and half.

219
00:14:15,727 --> 00:14:16,989
[SPEAKER_05]: It's literally split down the middle.

220
00:14:17,049 --> 00:14:19,431
[SPEAKER_05]: Half one side is one flavor, half the other is the other.

221
00:14:19,771 --> 00:14:21,733
[SPEAKER_05]: So I actually mixed it up and had banana eggnog.

222
00:14:23,475 --> 00:14:23,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh.

223
00:14:24,696 --> 00:14:25,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, God, it was good.

224
00:14:25,977 --> 00:14:27,359
[SPEAKER_05]: That was orgasm in a glass.

225
00:14:29,981 --> 00:14:30,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

226
00:14:31,883 --> 00:14:33,064
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it didn't taste like tuna.

227
00:14:33,084 --> 00:14:34,886
[SPEAKER_05]: It tasted like banana and eggnog.

228
00:14:35,687 --> 00:14:36,007
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn it.

229
00:14:37,008 --> 00:14:37,729
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, um...

230
00:14:39,321 --> 00:14:41,541
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to meet lots of good people.

231
00:14:41,561 --> 00:14:42,862
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a really good time.

232
00:14:45,122 --> 00:14:48,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Monday, my brother was being an ass the whole time.

233
00:14:50,303 --> 00:14:53,283
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not too proud of my brother Matthew.

234
00:14:54,544 --> 00:14:56,124
[SPEAKER_05]: I talked to my brother Phillip while I was there.

235
00:14:56,764 --> 00:15:00,125
[SPEAKER_05]: He's supposed to be down for Christmas, I think.

236
00:15:05,526 --> 00:15:06,306
[SPEAKER_05]: He's getting married.

237
00:15:07,086 --> 00:15:07,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, he's already married.

238
00:15:08,615 --> 00:15:17,067
[SPEAKER_05]: This is my brother who's a marine, and his wife's a marine, and they're actually going to Texas to have a humongous big Mexican wedding.

239
00:15:18,393 --> 00:15:19,134
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to go.

240
00:15:19,154 --> 00:15:21,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Because this is going to be a big party.

241
00:15:22,316 --> 00:15:23,776
[SPEAKER_12]: Will there be margaritas involved?

242
00:15:24,477 --> 00:15:24,777
[SPEAKER_05]: Likely.

243
00:15:24,797 --> 00:15:27,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

244
00:15:27,379 --> 00:15:30,401
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, people that know me pretty well know that I'm actually not a big tequila fan.

245
00:15:30,641 --> 00:15:34,703
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll drink margaritas because you can barely taste the tequila, but I cannot stand straight up tequila.

246
00:15:35,324 --> 00:15:38,346
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you had that cheap shit here.

247
00:15:39,626 --> 00:15:40,666
[SPEAKER_12]: But I still don't like tequila.

248
00:15:40,686 --> 00:15:41,567
[SPEAKER_12]: You can give me Cuervo.

249
00:15:41,627 --> 00:15:41,987
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't care.

250
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:42,587
[SPEAKER_12]: I still don't like it.

251
00:15:42,607 --> 00:15:44,028
[SPEAKER_05]: I can do shots of tequila.

252
00:15:44,108 --> 00:15:45,508
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's nasty.

253
00:15:45,828 --> 00:15:48,249
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the Blue Agave tequila.

254
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:53,171
[SPEAKER_05]: The stuff that Anita had way back at the Nasty House.

255
00:15:57,512 --> 00:15:59,293
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was pretty good.

256
00:15:59,413 --> 00:16:03,334
[SPEAKER_05]: I went back to New Orleans on Tuesday.

257
00:16:04,134 --> 00:16:05,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Hung out with my mommy.

258
00:16:05,275 --> 00:16:06,115
[SPEAKER_05]: I fussed at my mom.

259
00:16:06,155 --> 00:16:06,555
[SPEAKER_05]: It was fun.

260
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:13,785
[SPEAKER_05]: and then Jamie Fuss had the most long, boring flight back.

261
00:16:14,165 --> 00:16:20,170
[SPEAKER_05]: I hung out at the Dallas airport for nearly two hours.

262
00:16:21,571 --> 00:16:23,012
[SPEAKER_12]: Airports aren't so bad now, though.

263
00:16:23,032 --> 00:16:23,793
[SPEAKER_05]: They have Wi-Fi there.

264
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:24,594
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, they got Wi-Fi.

265
00:16:24,614 --> 00:16:26,435
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just chilling on my laptop.

266
00:16:26,816 --> 00:16:29,498
[SPEAKER_12]: Not just that, but everything there is to do.

267
00:16:29,518 --> 00:16:33,261
[SPEAKER_12]: They're practically shopping malls as well, although I would never buy anything there, but it's fun to look.

268
00:16:34,002 --> 00:16:35,423
[SPEAKER_12]: Airports aren't that bad anymore.

269
00:16:35,936 --> 00:16:36,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, some of them are.

270
00:16:37,797 --> 00:16:39,917
[SPEAKER_05]: But I was having a pretty good time, I mean.

271
00:16:40,197 --> 00:16:41,057
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I got on a plane.

272
00:16:41,397 --> 00:16:44,538
[SPEAKER_05]: I read the entirety of Ramsey's The Damned on the plane.

273
00:16:45,158 --> 00:16:51,000
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, I have to say, safely, the Dust and Rice book, because all the rest of her stuff since, it's kind of crap.

274
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:51,760
[SPEAKER_12]: It's been gay porn.

275
00:16:52,861 --> 00:16:54,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but it's also some crappy.

276
00:16:55,861 --> 00:16:56,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Really crappy.

277
00:16:57,842 --> 00:16:59,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Woman needs to get her groove back.

278
00:17:00,703 --> 00:17:01,543
[SPEAKER_05]: Not rest on her name.

279
00:17:03,539 --> 00:17:07,082
[SPEAKER_05]: Although I did read the first novel of her Sleeping Beauty book.

280
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:09,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Very interesting, very interesting.

281
00:17:10,084 --> 00:17:11,746
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, that was my trip.

282
00:17:12,046 --> 00:17:15,288
[SPEAKER_05]: The rest of the time I finished homework, put up with stupid crap.

283
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:19,558
[SPEAKER_12]: You talking about that Bomani party makes me nostalgic.

284
00:17:19,578 --> 00:17:20,939
[SPEAKER_12]: Remember when we used to do that stuff?

285
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,783
[SPEAKER_12]: At the old studio, which was a really great house for having parties.

286
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:25,944
[SPEAKER_12]: We'd have the Bomani parties.

287
00:17:26,204 --> 00:17:27,385
[SPEAKER_12]: We need to do that shit again.

288
00:17:27,545 --> 00:17:28,766
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we do.

289
00:17:28,806 --> 00:17:31,169
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, we kinda had a Bomani party last night.

290
00:17:31,249 --> 00:17:35,993
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it wasn't like a hardcore Bomani party, but I'm sure we'll get to that as we go on through How's Your Week, How's Your Day.

291
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:38,335
[SPEAKER_05]: You remember the stuff I would bring with me?

292
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:38,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

293
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:40,937
[SPEAKER_05]: People would say Bomani party, and I'm like, aw, shit.

294
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:45,941
[SPEAKER_12]: I remember you brought your Dreamcast pads to one party.

295
00:17:46,222 --> 00:17:46,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I did.

296
00:17:46,642 --> 00:17:47,402
[SPEAKER_12]: That was insane.

297
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:54,324
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, okay, this is what DDR was like in the old days before we had this vivid nonsense.

298
00:17:54,724 --> 00:18:03,670
[SPEAKER_12]: I remember when one of our old guests used to be on the show a bit, Somi Magus, when he put on his girlfriend's top and was playing Par Par Paradise.

299
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:04,251
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

300
00:18:04,311 --> 00:18:06,872
[SPEAKER_12]: And the picture made some rounds on the internet after that.

301
00:18:07,433 --> 00:18:14,758
[SPEAKER_12]: And I remember Loki would haul his computer and his Delight Delight reduplication and his pads he'd made for it.

302
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:17,179
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm nostalgic.

303
00:18:17,439 --> 00:18:21,863
[SPEAKER_05]: I would carry around the Drum Mania, Keyboard Mania, 2DX Controller, the bunch of games.

304
00:18:22,403 --> 00:18:24,544
[SPEAKER_05]: All the old beat manias, my ASCII pad.

305
00:18:26,486 --> 00:18:37,754
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you think that when this DDR thing is dead, which, you know, could happen any day now, do you think that these Bomani parties are still going to be going on?

306
00:18:37,854 --> 00:18:39,035
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we'll just go back to porn.

307
00:18:39,075 --> 00:18:43,658
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll just have to go back to the orgies, you're right.

308
00:18:44,138 --> 00:18:45,159
[SPEAKER_12]: How silly of me to ask.

309
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,623
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we'd have to get that copy of Ally McFeel again.

310
00:18:52,844 --> 00:18:53,524
[SPEAKER_13]: That was funny.

311
00:18:53,704 --> 00:18:56,006
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, anything else you want to share about your week and your day?

312
00:18:56,026 --> 00:18:57,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, no.

313
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,069
[SPEAKER_12]: Moving right along, alright.

314
00:19:01,811 --> 00:19:05,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, it had a cameo by Ron Jeremy.

315
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:23,394
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, I was looking up, um, there's a site online that's like, uh, these, uh, just paper dolls online, and I was trying to make, uh, a new avatar for myself on, uh, my live journal, and I accidentally came across the real doll site.

316
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:25,437
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh god.

317
00:19:25,987 --> 00:19:27,348
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very, very icky.

318
00:19:28,289 --> 00:19:30,431
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a request for a new DDR Freak avatar.

319
00:19:30,492 --> 00:19:32,393
[SPEAKER_12]: Because the gay pimp one you made me is really cool.

320
00:19:32,413 --> 00:19:33,675
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a request for a new one.

321
00:19:33,795 --> 00:19:36,277
[SPEAKER_12]: I want a Xander from Drawn Together.

322
00:19:37,098 --> 00:19:38,219
[SPEAKER_12]: Just to make Seeker jealous.

323
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,240
[SPEAKER_05]: From what?

324
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,962
[SPEAKER_12]: Drawn Together, that show on Comedy Central.

325
00:19:41,282 --> 00:19:41,723
[SPEAKER_05]: From what?

326
00:19:41,803 --> 00:19:43,184
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh girl, you are so far behind.

327
00:19:43,585 --> 00:19:45,707
[SPEAKER_05]: I do not have anything but basic channels.

328
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:47,731
[SPEAKER_05]: The local channels.

329
00:19:47,751 --> 00:19:48,291
[SPEAKER_12]: You're missing out.

330
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:49,091
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a funny show.

331
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:50,592
[SPEAKER_12]: I hardly ever watch TV.

332
00:19:50,692 --> 00:19:52,193
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the TV is retarded.

333
00:19:52,253 --> 00:19:55,234
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't even watch Survivor or The Apprentice or any of that reality bullshit anymore.

334
00:19:55,774 --> 00:19:57,035
[SPEAKER_12]: Drawn Together is the only show I watch.

335
00:19:57,395 --> 00:19:58,656
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, and look at Hell Freeze Over.

336
00:19:59,236 --> 00:20:00,016
[SPEAKER_12]: I know, I know.

337
00:20:01,377 --> 00:20:02,717
[SPEAKER_12]: You want to talk about Hell Freezing Over?

338
00:20:02,758 --> 00:20:06,179
[SPEAKER_12]: I came this close to joining a gym on Friday.

339
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:07,860
[SPEAKER_05]: For, um...

340
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:17,085
[SPEAKER_05]: For the people who didn't have that visual, Rob held his fingers the length of, um, never mind.

341
00:20:17,105 --> 00:20:19,086
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we're not going to talk about that.

342
00:20:20,307 --> 00:20:20,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut up.

343
00:20:21,588 --> 00:20:23,270
[SPEAKER_05]: No, because we don't bring up old drama.

344
00:20:25,151 --> 00:20:25,451
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

345
00:20:27,232 --> 00:20:27,613
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

346
00:20:29,414 --> 00:20:29,754
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yeah.

347
00:20:32,823 --> 00:20:35,125
[SPEAKER_05]: And it says that when you said Xander, I started thinking of Buffy.

348
00:20:35,285 --> 00:20:41,031
[SPEAKER_12]: I need to respond to some... I need to respond to some stuff in the chatroom going on right now.

349
00:20:41,111 --> 00:20:45,955
[SPEAKER_12]: First off, Sigurd's telling me he hates me because of the Xander thing, and he says his is better.

350
00:20:45,975 --> 00:20:46,315
[SPEAKER_12]: Whatever.

351
00:20:47,176 --> 00:20:49,538
[SPEAKER_12]: And somebody else... Where was it?

352
00:20:49,938 --> 00:20:52,080
[SPEAKER_12]: A couple people commented, DDR's not gonna die!

353
00:20:53,442 --> 00:20:53,702
[SPEAKER_12]: Well...

354
00:20:55,082 --> 00:20:56,223
[SPEAKER_12]: I also have an announcement?

355
00:20:56,263 --> 00:20:56,343
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

356
00:21:13,368 --> 00:21:15,429
[SPEAKER_05]: I no longer am on the Atkins crap.

357
00:21:15,869 --> 00:21:16,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, not crap.

358
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:17,630
[SPEAKER_05]: It's good for a lot of people.

359
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:18,951
[SPEAKER_05]: It was not good for me.

360
00:21:19,951 --> 00:21:21,412
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can have sushi again.

361
00:21:22,172 --> 00:21:22,892
[SPEAKER_12]: Congratulations.

362
00:21:23,713 --> 00:21:24,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Sushi is wonderful.

363
00:21:27,034 --> 00:21:29,195
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and, and, and, and, and, and.

364
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:30,896
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing else.

365
00:21:31,296 --> 00:21:31,616
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

366
00:21:32,556 --> 00:21:32,877
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Rob.

367
00:21:33,057 --> 00:21:33,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob.

368
00:21:33,377 --> 00:21:33,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob.

369
00:21:33,617 --> 00:21:33,797
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob.

370
00:21:33,897 --> 00:21:34,077
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob.

371
00:21:34,117 --> 00:21:34,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob.

372
00:21:34,357 --> 00:21:34,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob.

373
00:21:34,577 --> 00:21:34,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob.

374
00:21:34,717 --> 00:21:34,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob.

375
00:21:34,897 --> 00:21:35,178
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob.

376
00:21:35,218 --> 00:21:35,418
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob.

377
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:35,638
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob.

378
00:21:35,738 --> 00:21:35,938
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob.

379
00:21:35,978 --> 00:21:36,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob.

380
00:21:36,158 --> 00:21:36,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob.

381
00:21:36,398 --> 00:21:36,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob.

382
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:36,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob.

383
00:21:37,018 --> 00:21:37,198
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob.

384
00:21:37,238 --> 00:21:37,479
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob.

385
00:21:42,199 --> 00:21:42,539
[SPEAKER_12]: Damn.

386
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,020
[SPEAKER_12]: Angel, how was your week?

387
00:21:44,061 --> 00:21:44,721
[SPEAKER_12]: How was your day?

388
00:21:44,741 --> 00:21:47,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Angel, how was your week?

389
00:21:48,064 --> 00:21:48,704
[SPEAKER_12]: How was your day?

390
00:21:49,765 --> 00:21:55,269
[SPEAKER_04]: School was school and... Oh, nothing.

391
00:21:55,329 --> 00:21:56,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Saturday was nice.

392
00:21:57,751 --> 00:22:05,438
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to waste the week away until Saturday came, because, well, I had a birthday.

393
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:06,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on, everybody.

394
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:07,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.

395
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:08,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.

396
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:09,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.

397
00:22:10,805 --> 00:22:11,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Not.

398
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:14,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually hanging out with everyone was great.

399
00:22:17,028 --> 00:22:25,112
[SPEAKER_04]: And we had played lots of Fumani, Eight Style, and Poppin' Ten.

400
00:22:25,913 --> 00:22:28,134
[SPEAKER_04]: So I got to see those for the first time, that was pretty cool.

401
00:22:29,655 --> 00:22:37,499
[SPEAKER_04]: And the best thing of all was obviously hanging around with people that I don't usually get to hang around with, so that was good.

402
00:22:39,361 --> 00:22:41,983
[SPEAKER_04]: and just enjoying my birthday weekend so far, I guess.

403
00:22:46,245 --> 00:22:48,226
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, Bradley, how was your week?

404
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:48,826
[SPEAKER_11]: How was your day?

405
00:22:50,748 --> 00:22:54,810
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, this week was work, of course.

406
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:57,611
[SPEAKER_10]: And an interesting thing happened at work.

407
00:22:57,671 --> 00:23:01,854
[SPEAKER_10]: There was a person... My kind of work is sort of a training.

408
00:23:01,874 --> 00:23:03,735
[SPEAKER_10]: They train people to do stuff.

409
00:23:03,775 --> 00:23:05,336
[SPEAKER_10]: So one of the students came back.

410
00:23:05,396 --> 00:23:07,397
[SPEAKER_10]: He had some questions for her because he didn't do a test.

411
00:23:08,024 --> 00:23:08,264
[SPEAKER_10]: and so on.

412
00:23:33,793 --> 00:23:54,082
[SPEAKER_10]: The manager had to take him outside and talk for like an hour, try to calm him down, and then he came back on Friday, and his wife told him to bring along some candy just to give to us, or something like that, and he comes back and, okay, he's like, hell, here's this candy, and then he comes, and then he starts launching this big thing about discrimination!

413
00:23:54,402 --> 00:23:55,423
[SPEAKER_10]: He discriminates against me!

414
00:23:55,703 --> 00:23:56,643
[SPEAKER_10]: He doesn't like me!

415
00:23:57,364 --> 00:24:00,445
[SPEAKER_10]: And for some reason, some bullshit like that, and so...

416
00:24:02,713 --> 00:24:08,877
[SPEAKER_10]: Me and the receptionist are in the room and he's like, something kind of weird shit like that.

417
00:24:11,098 --> 00:24:17,181
[SPEAKER_10]: Good thing the boss came in a minute later and started talking to him so we could sneak out.

418
00:24:18,461 --> 00:24:23,604
[SPEAKER_10]: I went out in the hall for about an hour while they discussed something over and over again.

419
00:24:23,644 --> 00:24:29,007
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the kind of guy who says the same thing like ten fucking times to try to make some sort of point that

420
00:24:29,611 --> 00:24:30,813
[SPEAKER_10]: Were they getting paid for this?

421
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:31,153
[SPEAKER_10]: To talk?

422
00:24:41,916 --> 00:24:55,240
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, it's a business, so... I always found that humorous when, you know, there's big fights going on and we have to sit down and have a discussion, but we're all getting paid for it, type thing, and we just wasted three hours of productivity to talk out.

423
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,681
[SPEAKER_12]: Not that I ever get into disagreements with people, but, you know, I had to sit in on them.

424
00:24:58,701 --> 00:24:59,681
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I didn't have anything to do with it.

425
00:24:59,701 --> 00:25:02,062
[SPEAKER_10]: I just went out and stood in the hall because I didn't want to get involved.

426
00:25:02,362 --> 00:25:03,262
[SPEAKER_12]: And you got paid for it, too.

427
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:07,823
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so it was a nice one hour break just to not do anything.

428
00:25:08,283 --> 00:25:10,504
[SPEAKER_10]: Just wait until it cooled down.

429
00:25:11,644 --> 00:25:18,405
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, okay, and on Monday I got Katamari Damashii, and that was a lot of fun.

430
00:25:18,445 --> 00:25:33,908
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, every time something... It's like, it's like how when everybody says friends, you think of NBC, or when somebody says 90210, with Katamari it's... Shut up, Loki.

431
00:25:33,968 --> 00:25:39,989
[SPEAKER_10]: No, actually I think of that, I think of that song too.

432
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,861
[SPEAKER_10]: and played that most every day this week.

433
00:25:42,961 --> 00:25:46,623
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, I did play this every day this week, except for today, because I got up.

434
00:25:47,524 --> 00:25:59,553
[SPEAKER_10]: Last night was the party for Angel and Anita, or DD Archipelagic, for their birthdays, and that was a lot of fun, because Navi brought over 8th Style and Poppin' Music.

435
00:25:59,593 --> 00:26:01,774
[SPEAKER_12]: God bless the town's Poppin' Music whore.

436
00:26:02,715 --> 00:26:05,137
[SPEAKER_10]: I got to play on those Arcade Style controllers.

437
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:07,118
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and...

438
00:26:09,878 --> 00:26:36,361
[SPEAKER_10]: and that was fun which I didn't do all that great on 8th style because basically he had this he had it up on a stand and then the the TV was down like a two or three feet and several feet away so and I haven't played on like an arcade style controller in a long time and of course there was the just played like the hard news songs like oh god like oh what the hell is this called Nebula Grasper Nebula Grasper is a fucking impossible

439
00:26:37,318 --> 00:26:39,520
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, at least for a first try, it's like, what?

440
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,000
[SPEAKER_10]: What the hell?

441
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,141
[SPEAKER_10]: All over the place.

442
00:26:42,562 --> 00:26:56,611
[SPEAKER_12]: And I always love non-Bamani peoples, like the people who don't really play 2DX and DDR and stuff, I always love their reaction to stuff like that, because there were a few people at the party last night who don't really play DDR or 2DX, and they were just kind of watching Navi playing, and he was just crazy.

443
00:26:56,651 --> 00:27:02,315
[SPEAKER_12]: He was playing like Nebula Grasper or another or something, and everybody was just kind of like, that's crazy.

444
00:27:03,776 --> 00:27:04,737
[SPEAKER_06]: That is so crazy.

445
00:27:06,641 --> 00:27:07,642
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, that's crazy.

446
00:27:09,623 --> 00:27:16,088
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, actually I played pop music for the first time ever, because it's the first time I've actually been to anything where it's been brought out.

447
00:27:16,989 --> 00:27:21,753
[SPEAKER_10]: And I actually passed like a, I think I passed 22 on 9 button.

448
00:27:22,894 --> 00:27:23,434
[SPEAKER_10]: That was pretty good.

449
00:27:25,636 --> 00:27:29,219
[SPEAKER_10]: And today we got up late, so it didn't do all that much.

450
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,000
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all.

451
00:27:32,501 --> 00:27:34,823
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Loki, how was your week, how was your day?

452
00:27:37,301 --> 00:27:49,645
[SPEAKER_11]: Today did not start out too good due to certain events that have taken place outside of our apartment complex in the street.

453
00:27:50,565 --> 00:27:51,265
[SPEAKER_11]: It was not fun.

454
00:27:51,365 --> 00:27:52,666
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we'll get into that later, I'm sure.

455
00:27:53,286 --> 00:27:57,988
[SPEAKER_11]: And then yesterday, it was okay.

456
00:27:58,448 --> 00:27:59,048
[SPEAKER_11]: Went and...

457
00:28:00,209 --> 00:28:00,609
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura.com

458
00:28:16,956 --> 00:28:18,458
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't remember Thursday.

459
00:28:18,579 --> 00:28:19,860
[SPEAKER_11]: Thursday was okay, I guess.

460
00:28:20,862 --> 00:28:28,312
[SPEAKER_11]: Most of the week I've been just playing Final Fantasy XI, leveling my summoner to 20, which I just finished right before the show.

461
00:28:29,133 --> 00:28:30,034
[SPEAKER_11]: And, um...

462
00:28:31,756 --> 00:28:32,557
[SPEAKER_11]: What else have I been doing?

463
00:28:32,617 --> 00:28:39,562
[SPEAKER_11]: I've played a little bit of Grand Theft Auto, finally passed this mission that I couldn't beat for a while, and now I have to run errands for some pimp.

464
00:28:40,523 --> 00:28:45,066
[SPEAKER_11]: And, um... Went and saw Closer, I'll get into that later.

465
00:28:46,187 --> 00:28:49,650
[SPEAKER_11]: And, um... Eh, that's about all.

466
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:54,374
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been, like, kind of a week just crashing into the ground.

467
00:28:55,695 --> 00:28:57,076
[SPEAKER_12]: That sucks about your grandma, I'm sorry to hear it.

468
00:28:58,557 --> 00:28:58,857
[SPEAKER_11]: Eh, okay.

469
00:28:59,518 --> 00:29:01,359
[SPEAKER_12]: Have you used your machine to try and contact her yet?

470
00:29:02,771 --> 00:29:04,153
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I have not, you asshole.

471
00:29:07,298 --> 00:29:07,639
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway.

472
00:29:07,659 --> 00:29:10,703
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you ever open your portal to hell?

473
00:29:11,605 --> 00:29:14,710
[SPEAKER_12]: I was gonna say, you went on a ghostbusting trip yesterday, didn't you?

474
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:15,631
[SPEAKER_11]: Hunting.

475
00:29:15,871 --> 00:29:17,334
[SPEAKER_11]: Ghost hunting, not busting.

476
00:29:18,064 --> 00:29:40,433
[SPEAKER_11]: We just, we went, walked around Knights Ferry, which is basically this old abandoned, it's not really an abandoned mining town, it's just an old, um, mining town, it's got like a bunch of dilapidated, it's not really a mining town, I guess, they have an old, um, mill there that's kind of been, um, it's just the ruins of it, so we just walked around there, and they also have a very long, um, they have a 115 meter, um,

477
00:29:41,773 --> 00:29:42,934
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

478
00:29:58,969 --> 00:30:03,973
[SPEAKER_11]: My example was something that's more trauma there than, you know, old.

479
00:30:04,313 --> 00:30:08,576
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, because necessarily just visiting any old place is not going to work.

480
00:30:08,596 --> 00:30:13,219
[SPEAKER_11]: You need to have something where, oh yeah, 50 people murdered there, you know, that kind of thing.

481
00:30:13,299 --> 00:30:16,981
[SPEAKER_11]: Just something, you know, traumatic, like a sane asylum or something like that.

482
00:30:17,342 --> 00:30:20,344
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, no luck with any of that stuff around here, so.

483
00:30:21,004 --> 00:30:21,244
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh well.

484
00:30:23,386 --> 00:30:24,927
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, that's what I've been doing.

485
00:30:25,307 --> 00:30:26,708
[SPEAKER_10]: Isn't this place the insane asylum?

486
00:30:27,856 --> 00:30:28,396
[SPEAKER_11]: Not yet.

487
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:30,177
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to haunt this place first.

488
00:30:30,337 --> 00:30:31,918
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't quite gotten around to that yet.

489
00:30:33,038 --> 00:30:35,919
[SPEAKER_11]: Soon enough, you know, I've been, like, I have my priorities.

490
00:30:35,939 --> 00:30:38,520
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I was going to work on the cabin today, and then I just got tired.

491
00:30:39,261 --> 00:30:40,401
[SPEAKER_11]: Those fuckers this morning.

492
00:30:42,022 --> 00:30:46,023
[SPEAKER_12]: And by tired, he means looking for a party in Final Fantasy XI so he can get his summoner to level 20.

493
00:30:46,084 --> 00:30:46,324
[SPEAKER_12]: At it!

494
00:30:47,907 --> 00:30:51,371
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I was tired from other things, but yes, I just got bored of that too.

495
00:30:51,511 --> 00:31:00,522
[SPEAKER_11]: But the other things in the morning made me tired because I'm exhausted right now from having to wake up early yesterday and having to wake up early today.

496
00:31:03,479 --> 00:31:04,720
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, my turn, my week and my day.

497
00:31:05,021 --> 00:31:09,405
[SPEAKER_12]: I got to play 8th Style and Pop Music 10 twice this week, actually, because I hung out with Navi on Monday.

498
00:31:09,646 --> 00:31:13,169
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll talk about those games a little bit later, because, you know, I want to talk about my mommy stuff a little bit.

499
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:21,278
[SPEAKER_12]: But Navi and I, after playing some of that, we got to go to the mall, and I was going to help him do some Christmas shopping over at Arden Fair, which is a big mall in Sacramento.

500
00:31:21,318 --> 00:31:21,799
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a huge mall.

501
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,840
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we ended up walking out of there.

502
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,061
[SPEAKER_12]: He didn't end up buying anything.

503
00:31:26,101 --> 00:31:27,721
[SPEAKER_12]: He just kind of looked around at some different places.

504
00:31:28,182 --> 00:31:31,363
[SPEAKER_12]: And I fucking bought an iPod at the Apple store.

505
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:34,144
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I wanted one, really.

506
00:31:35,144 --> 00:31:36,545
[SPEAKER_13]: I wanted one really badly.

507
00:31:36,625 --> 00:31:38,146
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm still two away from my free one.

508
00:31:38,166 --> 00:31:40,907
[SPEAKER_11]: Why don't you just buy a fucking iMac, you know?

509
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:42,627
[SPEAKER_11]: Just join the cult.

510
00:31:42,807 --> 00:31:44,108
[SPEAKER_12]: I've thought about it, actually.

511
00:31:45,268 --> 00:31:48,290
[SPEAKER_11]: Good, it's a big flaming piece of shit that doesn't do anything.

512
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:50,030
[SPEAKER_12]: You make Apple users cry.

513
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:51,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless you're into graphics.

514
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:54,940
[SPEAKER_12]: or Media, which, you know, this show happens to be.

515
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,361
[SPEAKER_11]: Because all the pros are on Macs.

516
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,923
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe we wouldn't have the freaking buzz on a Mac.

517
00:31:59,723 --> 00:32:00,063
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway.

518
00:32:00,083 --> 00:32:02,404
[SPEAKER_11]: We wouldn't have any of the software either.

519
00:32:03,585 --> 00:32:05,006
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, besides that.

520
00:32:05,026 --> 00:32:05,766
[SPEAKER_07]: Virtual PC.

521
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:06,667
[SPEAKER_12]: Besides this.

522
00:32:07,027 --> 00:32:08,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, I have to emulate a good PC.

523
00:32:10,912 --> 00:32:14,415
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wanted an iPod actually because the stereo in my car broke a while back.

524
00:32:14,535 --> 00:32:20,619
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, it was Sigurd's Echo Image CD that broke my CD player in the car actually because it ate it and wouldn't give it back one day.

525
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,042
[SPEAKER_12]: Once it heard Echo Image, it could hear no other music.

526
00:32:25,002 --> 00:32:27,244
[SPEAKER_12]: Basically, it's how it all boiled down.

527
00:32:28,585 --> 00:32:33,829
[SPEAKER_12]: So, it won't eject CDs anymore and now it won't even play the CD that's in there.

528
00:32:33,889 --> 00:32:34,029
[SPEAKER_12]: So,

529
00:32:34,489 --> 00:32:41,715
[SPEAKER_12]: Luckily, though, it has an auxiliary port in it, so I can plug anything I want in there, so I'm just like, fuck it, I'm gonna get an iPod, and I'll just use that as my car stereo.

530
00:32:42,015 --> 00:32:52,564
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's worked out really well, except for the fact that if you think I'm bad when I'm talking on my cell phone and trying to drive, you should see me when I'm trying to find the song on my iPod I want to hear and drive at the same time.

531
00:32:54,225 --> 00:32:54,766
[SPEAKER_12]: It's beautiful.

532
00:32:56,329 --> 00:33:23,821
[SPEAKER_05]: and you know what they can pass all the laws they want to say I can't talk on my cell phone and drive but I don't see them making any law anytime soon that says I can't play on my iPod and try to drive at the same time so look out I believe the law is operation of electronic devices while driving so your iPod's included god damn it extraneous like CD like laptops peripheral devices

533
00:33:25,618 --> 00:33:36,565
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, Sigurd in our chatroom right now over at OrangeLaunchRadio.com, he says that that day where my echo image, or his echo image CD got eaten by my car stereo player, he said that that day kind of pissed him off.

534
00:33:36,925 --> 00:33:41,808
[SPEAKER_12]: Except for the Classic Gaming Expo and the little girl that was hitting all the buttons on the restrooms that she rocked.

535
00:33:42,189 --> 00:33:47,072
[SPEAKER_12]: And that reminds me, I actually found the picture of Jamie doing that at Classic Gaming Expo.

536
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:48,853
[SPEAKER_13]: I had my heads in the air.

537
00:33:48,873 --> 00:33:49,954
[SPEAKER_13]: What was it?

538
00:33:49,994 --> 00:33:51,676
[SPEAKER_13]: We paid you $10 to do it?

539
00:33:51,776 --> 00:33:52,176
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

540
00:33:52,257 --> 00:33:54,218
[SPEAKER_05]: And I spent it on Pac-Land for the TurboGrafx.

541
00:33:54,238 --> 00:33:57,822
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, we bought some game for you, basically, for you to imitate a little girl.

542
00:33:57,882 --> 00:33:58,702
[SPEAKER_12]: I found the picture.

543
00:33:58,783 --> 00:33:59,743
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to send it to Sigurd.

544
00:34:02,626 --> 00:34:04,868
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, we're going to the Classic Gaming Expo again this year.

545
00:34:05,569 --> 00:34:07,070
[SPEAKER_12]: Even though... It's a bowling game.

546
00:34:07,491 --> 00:34:13,136
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though last year was kind of... The only reason that last year's was eh was because they had that thing a few days before.

547
00:34:14,182 --> 00:34:16,384
[SPEAKER_05]: The Classic Gaming Expo this year is going to be in Burlingame.

548
00:34:16,424 --> 00:34:18,365
[SPEAKER_05]: That means trips to network video.

549
00:34:20,007 --> 00:34:21,568
[SPEAKER_05]: And the store that sells the airsoft guns.

550
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:26,571
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, and I guess that was pretty much my week of my day.

551
00:34:26,651 --> 00:34:35,118
[SPEAKER_12]: I spent a lot of time playing Final Fantasy XI as well because basically I got stood up Friday night, so I decided to wither away my sorrows inside a nice game of Final Fantasy XI, so...

552
00:34:36,138 --> 00:34:45,104
[SPEAKER_12]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

553
00:34:58,752 --> 00:35:01,635
[SPEAKER_12]: The freaking game took us three hours to play.

554
00:35:02,035 --> 00:35:04,217
[SPEAKER_12]: The last time I played Cranium it only took two.

555
00:35:04,557 --> 00:35:06,379
[SPEAKER_12]: Turbo Cranium ended up taking longer.

556
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:07,700
[SPEAKER_12]: What in the hell is up with that?

557
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,842
[SPEAKER_12]: And no, it's not because we kept taking breaks.

558
00:35:09,962 --> 00:35:11,543
[SPEAKER_12]: It just was a long-ass game.

559
00:35:11,563 --> 00:35:12,204
[SPEAKER_12]: It was no shorter.

560
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:16,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody's gonna get this joke but you, Rob, but you can be my puppet master any time.

561
00:35:18,103 --> 00:35:22,347
[SPEAKER_12]: How foul.

562
00:35:22,367 --> 00:35:24,809
[SPEAKER_12]: I ended up having to leave around midnight because I was kind of afraid.

563
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:29,333
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, A, I was tired, and B, I was afraid I wasn't going to be able to park when I got back here if I waited any longer.

564
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:30,534
[SPEAKER_12]: But how was the rest of the night?

565
00:35:31,375 --> 00:35:31,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

566
00:35:31,615 --> 00:35:37,140
[SPEAKER_04]: We ended up playing Hear Me Out for the majority of the night.

567
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:41,724
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we played Poppin' 10 also, but yeah, that other game was kind of weird.

568
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,882
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, a DD Alcoholic made sushi from scratch.

569
00:35:46,902 --> 00:35:50,004
[SPEAKER_12]: It was really good, but it was kind of interesting because she used wieners in it.

570
00:35:50,124 --> 00:35:52,145
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, she used hot dogs instead of fish.

571
00:35:52,165 --> 00:35:53,385
[SPEAKER_12]: She put, like, hot dogs in there.

572
00:35:53,705 --> 00:35:54,706
[SPEAKER_12]: But it was actually really good.

573
00:35:54,726 --> 00:35:55,426
[SPEAKER_12]: It was kind of weird.

574
00:35:56,067 --> 00:35:57,007
[SPEAKER_12]: I just thought it was neat.

575
00:35:57,307 --> 00:35:58,268
[SPEAKER_12]: It was very resourceful.

576
00:35:58,288 --> 00:35:58,808
[SPEAKER_12]: It was a good idea.

577
00:35:59,889 --> 00:36:00,089
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway.

578
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:02,731
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to take a break.

579
00:36:02,751 --> 00:36:05,413
[SPEAKER_12]: When we come back from this break, we're going to talk a little bit more about 2DX8 style.

580
00:36:05,433 --> 00:36:07,194
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to talk a little more about Pop Music 10.

581
00:36:07,875 --> 00:36:11,518
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to play the new remix of I Feel for you guys.

582
00:36:11,558 --> 00:36:16,842
[SPEAKER_12]: We played it on Thursday night, but I know nobody listens to Outside the Box on Thursday night, but more of you guys listened tonight.

583
00:36:16,862 --> 00:36:25,128
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're going to play the new I Feel mix from Service Pack 7 from Ultramix 2, because a lot of people don't want to hear that.

584
00:36:25,148 --> 00:36:25,989
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're going to play that for you guys.

585
00:36:26,289 --> 00:36:28,030
[SPEAKER_12]: and plenty more when we come back from this break.

586
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:31,033
[SPEAKER_12]: In this break, though, some music from DDR Festival.

587
00:36:31,373 --> 00:36:35,216
[SPEAKER_12]: Because we haven't really gotten to hear much music from DDR Festival yet, but we have some songs for you guys.

588
00:36:35,236 --> 00:36:40,039
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to hear Superstar, Diamonds, and Cutie Honey on this break.

589
00:36:40,359 --> 00:36:41,020
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll be right back.

590
00:36:42,819 --> 00:36:55,172
[SPEAKER_12]: It's honestly, I didn't bother to buy Festival, I just, I didn't think there was enough in it for me, because I had Extreme, and I have an Xbox, so, and I had Ultramix One, which are a lot of songs came from, but Festival certainly has some quirky little songs in it, doesn't it?

591
00:36:56,013 --> 00:36:57,374
[SPEAKER_12]: Interesting, that's all I have to say.

592
00:36:57,794 --> 00:37:03,060
[SPEAKER_12]: Although I love Superstar, I, it's almost worth buying the mix for that, but not really, because that's like 80 bucks.

593
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,641
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

594
00:37:27,837 --> 00:37:28,537
[SPEAKER_12]: 2DX8Style.

595
00:37:28,978 --> 00:37:33,139
[SPEAKER_12]: Got a chance to check it out over at Navi, Pop Music Horror.

596
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:33,539
[SPEAKER_12]: He has it.

597
00:37:33,559 --> 00:37:34,859
[SPEAKER_12]: I got to check it out earlier this week.

598
00:37:35,239 --> 00:37:36,960
[SPEAKER_12]: And man, do I suck at 2DX now.

599
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:37,620
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, seriously.

600
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,440
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh my god, me too.

601
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:41,061
[SPEAKER_12]: I haven't played 2DX seriously in quite a while.

602
00:37:41,161 --> 00:37:42,481
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't really get into 7Style.

603
00:37:42,501 --> 00:37:43,342
[SPEAKER_12]: I played it one time.

604
00:37:44,122 --> 00:37:54,925
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot of this has to do with the fact that my controller is broken, and I'd rather buy myself a lot of other useless crap, like iPods and things like that, than buy a new 2DX controller.

605
00:37:55,405 --> 00:37:58,227
[SPEAKER_12]: and I seriously think that's the reason that I haven't been playing a whole lot of 2DX.

606
00:37:58,527 --> 00:38:00,989
[SPEAKER_12]: The 8th style is pretty sweet, I gotta say.

607
00:38:01,009 --> 00:38:02,390
[SPEAKER_12]: It has a lot of great new songs in it.

608
00:38:03,251 --> 00:38:07,674
[SPEAKER_12]: For those of you guys that listen to this show regularly, you already know how I feel about Everyday Lovely Day, like I love that song.

609
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:09,996
[SPEAKER_12]: And then of course it has a bunch of 2DX Red songs in it.

610
00:38:11,496 --> 00:38:15,878
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, not a bunch, but three, which I consider to be a bunch for, you know, preview, because usually it's only like one or two.

611
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:21,060
[SPEAKER_12]: And then some of the new consumer videos are pretty funny.

612
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:23,061
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, Step Into the New World.

613
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:24,721
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't really like that song a whole lot.

614
00:38:24,761 --> 00:38:25,782
[SPEAKER_12]: The song kind of, meh.

615
00:38:26,222 --> 00:38:29,963
[SPEAKER_12]: But the video's pretty great, like, with the anime and everything and the guy running down the street.

616
00:38:29,983 --> 00:38:33,145
[SPEAKER_12]: And he uses this computer animation technique that's very interesting.

617
00:38:33,225 --> 00:38:35,645
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, it turns these 2D settings into 3D.

618
00:38:35,906 --> 00:38:37,226
[SPEAKER_12]: Kind of like Parappa, the rapper.

619
00:38:37,246 --> 00:38:39,027
[SPEAKER_12]: It looks like that, except not drawn.

620
00:38:40,047 --> 00:38:42,168
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess that makes no sense whatsoever, I don't care.

621
00:38:43,289 --> 00:38:46,590
[SPEAKER_12]: And then also another video I love is Lovebox.

622
00:38:46,851 --> 00:38:55,315
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if you guys got to see this video at all, but Lovebox is the one that has, I think it's Meg and one of her cohorts or something, I don't know, an uncredited person.

623
00:38:55,995 --> 00:38:59,417
[SPEAKER_12]: They're dressed up as these like Austin Powers dance chicks, kind of.

624
00:39:00,237 --> 00:39:04,678
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, they're all dressed in these, uh, like, 60s hippie, like, things you'd see on Laugh-In.

625
00:39:04,698 --> 00:39:05,678
[SPEAKER_12]: You remember that old show Laugh-In?

626
00:39:06,018 --> 00:39:07,199
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, when the people would be dancing?

627
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:13,780
[SPEAKER_12]: It was kind of like that, and they're just driving around the city and singing, and they're wearing, like, glow bracelets and stuff.

628
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,000
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really great.

629
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:16,340
[SPEAKER_12]: Love Fox.

630
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,581
[SPEAKER_12]: I highly recommend this one.

631
00:39:18,901 --> 00:39:22,242
[SPEAKER_12]: Although the song kind of sucks, but the video's great.

632
00:39:24,602 --> 00:39:26,883
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you guys have gotten to play 8-Style a little bit, too.

633
00:39:26,923 --> 00:39:28,163
[SPEAKER_12]: What do you guys think of 2DX 8-Style?

634
00:39:30,191 --> 00:39:31,852
[SPEAKER_05]: I was stuck in Let Me Go with Bella.

635
00:39:32,853 --> 00:39:34,094
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I remember that song was so great.

636
00:39:34,114 --> 00:39:35,716
[SPEAKER_05]: And the scene kept falling out of my lap.

637
00:39:36,977 --> 00:39:37,757
[SPEAKER_05]: I miss arcades.

638
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:44,002
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, were you playing on a regular, like, little controller?

639
00:39:44,183 --> 00:39:44,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

640
00:39:44,543 --> 00:39:47,325
[SPEAKER_12]: See, now he has one of those arcade-style controllers, so you don't have to put it in your lap.

641
00:39:47,625 --> 00:39:51,669
[SPEAKER_12]: But they're kind of loud, like, they're really, those arcade-style ones are really loud.

642
00:39:51,709 --> 00:39:55,312
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, you could hear that thing probably outside, like, a mile away, clack, clack, clack, but...

643
00:39:56,058 --> 00:39:56,518
[SPEAKER_12]: That's pretty neat.

644
00:39:56,619 --> 00:39:59,801
[SPEAKER_12]: And sometimes it kind of overpowers the music, but it plays beautifully.

645
00:39:59,921 --> 00:40:00,802
[SPEAKER_12]: It plays so beautifully.

646
00:40:01,903 --> 00:40:03,905
[SPEAKER_12]: Arcadian, what do you think of 2DX8Style?

647
00:40:04,645 --> 00:40:05,246
[SPEAKER_10]: Looks pretty nice.

648
00:40:05,446 --> 00:40:05,726
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah?

649
00:40:06,267 --> 00:40:08,008
[SPEAKER_12]: Is this something you think you might have to break down and purchase?

650
00:40:08,348 --> 00:40:09,189
[SPEAKER_10]: I already have purchased it.

651
00:40:09,329 --> 00:40:09,769
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, have you?

652
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:10,810
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't gotten it yet.

653
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:11,131
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh.

654
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:13,252
[SPEAKER_10]: You probably mentioned it, I forgot.

655
00:40:13,653 --> 00:40:15,154
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I mentioned it like two weeks ago.

656
00:40:15,174 --> 00:40:15,554
[SPEAKER_12]: That's right.

657
00:40:15,854 --> 00:40:16,215
[SPEAKER_12]: I forgot.

658
00:40:19,498 --> 00:40:22,220
[SPEAKER_12]: Any particularly favorite consumer songs that you like in 8Style?

659
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:27,550
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't heard him enough to truly say yes.

660
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:37,258
[SPEAKER_12]: I played a new 7-star, I think it was Don't Be Afraid Myself, was one of the, like, it's the J-pop one, it's got a really, it's actually got a pretty That song was great!

661
00:40:37,398 --> 00:40:38,819
[SPEAKER_12]: That's got a pretty cool video to it.

662
00:40:38,839 --> 00:40:40,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't it have a video in the bathroom?

663
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,100
[SPEAKER_05]: In the shower?

664
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,441
[SPEAKER_12]: I think so.

665
00:40:42,461 --> 00:40:44,762
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like they were dancing in, like, a locker room shower.

666
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:45,903
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, I think that might have been it.

667
00:40:45,983 --> 00:40:47,964
[SPEAKER_12]: I could only kind of half-see the video because I can't play the song.

668
00:40:47,984 --> 00:40:48,465
[SPEAKER_12]: That song was cool!

669
00:40:48,625 --> 00:40:51,586
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, the song is cool, but man, I fucked up that song so bad.

670
00:40:51,806 --> 00:40:55,869
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, it really shows, like, how out of it on 2DX I am because I can't sight-read anymore.

671
00:40:56,229 --> 00:41:00,653
[SPEAKER_12]: I was able to play Attitude and Stardream and all these songs I used to play all the time on 8thStyle.

672
00:41:00,673 --> 00:41:01,774
[SPEAKER_12]: I was able to play those just fine.

673
00:41:02,054 --> 00:41:06,298
[SPEAKER_12]: But man, throw something new at me and the rhythms and everything didn't make any sense to me.

674
00:41:06,638 --> 00:41:07,319
[SPEAKER_06]: It was so sad.

675
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,541
[SPEAKER_12]: I cry for my 2DX skills.

676
00:41:10,422 --> 00:41:11,042
[SPEAKER_12]: But Dancer.

677
00:41:11,923 --> 00:41:13,925
[SPEAKER_12]: 8thStyle was worth it just to be able to play Dancer again.

678
00:41:14,005 --> 00:41:16,827
[SPEAKER_12]: Although, is it just me or is something kind of weird at the end of the video?

679
00:41:16,927 --> 00:41:19,490
[SPEAKER_12]: Like it freezes kind of at the end of the video.

680
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:21,511
[SPEAKER_12]: I remember it kind of faded out in the arcade.

681
00:41:21,551 --> 00:41:22,372
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe I'm just crazy.

682
00:41:22,572 --> 00:41:22,872
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

683
00:41:23,633 --> 00:41:29,238
[SPEAKER_12]: But a lot of 8-style machines had broken videos in the first place, so it was probably the first time a lot of people got to actually play 2DX with the videos.

684
00:41:29,258 --> 00:41:30,259
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know, pretty cool.

685
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,661
[SPEAKER_12]: Angel, what were your thoughts on 2DX 8-style?

686
00:41:33,982 --> 00:41:38,026
[SPEAKER_04]: Lovage, Orange, Attitude, and A. That's all I have to say.

687
00:41:38,646 --> 00:41:44,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, I used to watch you guys play that all the time, and I was always all envious, and I still am, so, yeah.

688
00:41:44,931 --> 00:41:45,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

689
00:41:47,145 --> 00:41:51,688
[SPEAKER_12]: A is technically a 7th style song, but it does make a repeat in 8th style.

690
00:41:51,828 --> 00:41:59,673
[SPEAKER_12]: It's interesting, they took some of the most noteworthy 7th style songs, like A and Stoic, and they ended up repeating on 8th style after all.

691
00:41:59,693 --> 00:42:01,674
[SPEAKER_12]: So now I'm kind of like, do I really need to get 7th style?

692
00:42:02,274 --> 00:42:08,298
[SPEAKER_12]: But then I remembered, yes, I want to whore Beauty of Silence in the privacy of my own home, is basically what it boils down to.

693
00:42:08,738 --> 00:42:10,179
[SPEAKER_12]: Just like, remember the old arcade days?

694
00:42:10,339 --> 00:42:12,040
[SPEAKER_12]: Frickin' everybody whored Beauty of Silence.

695
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:12,841
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, almost everybody.

696
00:42:13,801 --> 00:42:14,982
[SPEAKER_12]: I know I was a big part of that, but...

697
00:42:16,387 --> 00:42:19,560
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, player's best would be 5-1-1, because all the noobs would play 5-1-1.

698
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:20,604
[SPEAKER_12]: And then, like, Beauty is Silenced.

699
00:42:24,065 --> 00:42:28,709
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, moving on, Poppin' Music 10 was another game I got to check out earlier this week.

700
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:33,993
[SPEAKER_12]: Pretty cool, I have to admit, I think I kind of like the way 9 is set up a little bit better.

701
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:49,226
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought the unlock system in 9 was a lot cooler, because 10 has this wacky roulette thing, and Navi had the timing down perfect, though, so that he was managing to unlock quite a bit of stuff on the roulette wheel, but it was kind of yawn to me, because the Gambler's E thing in 9 was

702
00:42:49,606 --> 00:42:50,827
[SPEAKER_12]: I was a little disappointed by that

703
00:43:16,202 --> 00:43:18,803
[SPEAKER_12]: The middle one, wherever it's ranked, like a 30 or something.

704
00:43:18,823 --> 00:43:20,103
[SPEAKER_12]: 29, 30, I don't remember.

705
00:43:21,884 --> 00:43:23,845
[SPEAKER_12]: Somebody needs to get me $1,000 for Christmas.

706
00:43:23,985 --> 00:43:34,128
[SPEAKER_12]: So that way I can buy an ASC for 2DX, an ASC for pop music, and then import 8th style and as many pop music as they can before I'm bankrupt.

707
00:43:35,028 --> 00:43:42,291
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you guys want to get me $1,000 for Christmas, that would be great.

708
00:43:42,391 --> 00:43:42,711
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

709
00:43:42,791 --> 00:43:45,372
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you play Poppin' 10 at all at that party that you went to, Jamie?

710
00:43:46,932 --> 00:43:47,853
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't have Poppin' 10.

711
00:43:48,053 --> 00:43:50,734
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I thought maybe... I brought Poppin' 9 with me, but we ended up not playing it.

712
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:51,115
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh.

713
00:43:51,895 --> 00:43:52,135
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

714
00:43:52,736 --> 00:43:54,797
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, what did you think of Poppin' Music 10, Angel?

715
00:43:56,098 --> 00:44:00,322
[SPEAKER_04]: It was pretty, and watching Navi play is just insane.

716
00:44:00,883 --> 00:44:14,716
[SPEAKER_04]: He plays faster than anyone else I've seen, you know, but I just ended up watching it because I knew a lot of people wanted to play Pop Intense, so I just kind of left it at that.

717
00:44:15,197 --> 00:44:17,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus we were busy with Cranium anyway, so, you know.

718
00:44:19,833 --> 00:44:24,197
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, by the way, if anybody wants to call us, we just opened up the Skype line.

719
00:44:24,238 --> 00:44:30,003
[SPEAKER_12]: If you want to figure out what that's all about, head on over to www.orangelondradio.com and click on Interact With Us.

720
00:44:30,524 --> 00:44:36,049
[SPEAKER_12]: And we want to take some phone calls asking you guys that have gotten a chance to play 8th Style or Pop Music 10, what you guys think of it.

721
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:38,892
[SPEAKER_12]: I have to say that the final verdict on 10, I kind of...

722
00:44:40,273 --> 00:44:45,996
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, obviously I need to play it more, and obviously I still want it, but I still think I kind of like 9 just a little bit better.

723
00:44:46,636 --> 00:44:53,119
[SPEAKER_12]: I just think 9 had some, it was just set up a little better, and just kind of had some better songs, but 10's really good, don't get me wrong.

724
00:44:53,179 --> 00:44:56,420
[SPEAKER_12]: I would still buy 10 in a heartbeat, but I just think I like 9 a little bit better.

725
00:44:57,721 --> 00:44:59,021
[SPEAKER_12]: But, anyway.

726
00:45:00,302 --> 00:45:03,043
[SPEAKER_12]: Arcadian, you got to play a little bit of Poppin' 10, what'd you think?

727
00:45:04,143 --> 00:45:04,543
[SPEAKER_12]: Real fast.

728
00:45:04,884 --> 00:45:05,804
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

729
00:45:06,741 --> 00:45:08,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey there, Sky, Siggy here.

730
00:45:08,603 --> 00:45:09,504
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi Siggy, how you doing?

731
00:45:10,265 --> 00:45:11,647
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing fine.

732
00:45:11,787 --> 00:45:13,209
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what?

733
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:16,993
[SPEAKER_12]: I finally figured out what you were talking about last week with the 2DX8 style.

734
00:45:17,033 --> 00:45:20,497
[SPEAKER_12]: You remember how you said there was something in it that looked like extreme US?

735
00:45:20,858 --> 00:45:23,060
[SPEAKER_12]: And a lot of people in the chat room went, what the fuck is he talking about?

736
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:24,122
[SPEAKER_12]: That kind of thing, remember that?

737
00:45:25,102 --> 00:45:26,082
[SPEAKER_12]: I got what you meant now.

738
00:45:26,142 --> 00:45:31,024
[SPEAKER_12]: It was the menu in the beginning, kind of had that round wheel thing.

739
00:45:31,724 --> 00:45:32,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's the menu.

740
00:45:32,944 --> 00:45:33,405
[SPEAKER_12]: Gotcha.

741
00:45:33,805 --> 00:45:36,125
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you got your copy of 8th Style, yes?

742
00:45:36,445 --> 00:45:36,646
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep.

743
00:45:36,926 --> 00:45:37,906
[SPEAKER_12]: And how have you been enjoying it?

744
00:45:39,386 --> 00:45:40,087
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really good.

745
00:45:40,787 --> 00:45:46,108
[SPEAKER_02]: I was one of the lucky ones who got the 2DX Red e-amusement card, because after November 18th, they don't have it anymore.

746
00:45:46,508 --> 00:45:46,888
[SPEAKER_12]: Really?

747
00:45:47,409 --> 00:45:47,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

748
00:45:47,889 --> 00:45:51,930
[SPEAKER_12]: So, is there anything special about the card, or is it just the fact that, hey, I got a card?

749
00:45:53,136 --> 00:45:59,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I wanted to use the 2DX red e-amusement card at AI, because they have the e-amusement card readers.

750
00:45:59,559 --> 00:46:00,320
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what I heard.

751
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:06,443
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, I'm actually going to be able to go to Arcade Infinity next week, I'm hoping.

752
00:46:06,843 --> 00:46:07,984
[SPEAKER_02]: The e-amusement card over there.

753
00:46:09,564 --> 00:46:10,145
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm thinking about it.

754
00:46:10,825 --> 00:46:11,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's cool.

755
00:46:11,765 --> 00:46:12,606
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, thinking about it.

756
00:46:14,427 --> 00:46:16,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Recently, I double-aided a V-35.

757
00:46:18,397 --> 00:46:23,982
[SPEAKER_12]: See, V35 is one of those songs I used to be really good at, but then I just suck it up now.

758
00:46:24,002 --> 00:46:24,883
[SPEAKER_12]: What is that you're holding up there?

759
00:46:24,983 --> 00:46:25,503
[SPEAKER_12]: A Namco?

760
00:46:26,364 --> 00:46:27,966
[SPEAKER_05]: My Tekken 5 character data card.

761
00:46:28,846 --> 00:46:29,607
[SPEAKER_12]: Get on topic!

762
00:46:30,748 --> 00:46:31,248
[SPEAKER_12]: No, it's cool.

763
00:46:32,189 --> 00:46:33,571
[SPEAKER_12]: Have you gotten to play Pop Music 10 at all?

764
00:46:34,271 --> 00:46:34,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, no.

765
00:46:35,532 --> 00:46:39,316
[SPEAKER_02]: The last time I played a Pop Music was Pop Music 9 back in San Francisco.

766
00:46:39,556 --> 00:46:40,957
[SPEAKER_12]: See, but isn't Pop Music 9 great?

767
00:46:43,579 --> 00:46:44,240
[SPEAKER_12]: I think so, anyway.

768
00:46:44,893 --> 00:46:49,457
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, so, anything else you wanna share about 2DX8Style, your experiences you're having with it?

769
00:46:50,298 --> 00:47:04,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, um, there's a, there's a thing, uh, about the, uh, getting the, the hidden songs, uh, 2DX, 2DX Red songs, you don't have to, you don't have to, uh, about, about the easy thing, it's, it's, it turns out to be false.

770
00:47:05,710 --> 00:47:06,310
[SPEAKER_12]: What, what do you mean?

771
00:47:06,651 --> 00:47:13,616
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't, you can't play, you can't play, uh, easy songs by, by unlocking, uh, by unlocking Tayo.

772
00:47:13,636 --> 00:47:14,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.

773
00:47:15,104 --> 00:47:17,645
[SPEAKER_02]: by using an easy option.

774
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:19,947
[SPEAKER_12]: So you can't play an easy to unlock those songs?

775
00:47:20,327 --> 00:47:20,767
[SPEAKER_02]: You can.

776
00:47:21,067 --> 00:47:21,647
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, you can?

777
00:47:22,148 --> 00:47:22,408
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

778
00:47:22,488 --> 00:47:23,909
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, shit, that makes it easy, doesn't it?

779
00:47:25,209 --> 00:47:28,171
[SPEAKER_12]: And what is the requirement again to start unlocking some of these 2DX Red songs?

780
00:47:28,191 --> 00:47:29,131
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I actually don't remember.

781
00:47:29,652 --> 00:47:35,194
[SPEAKER_02]: Play at least about 100 songs to unlock Spiral Galaxy and Taiyou.

782
00:47:36,575 --> 00:47:36,895
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow.

783
00:47:36,915 --> 00:47:37,796
[SPEAKER_12]: 100 songs?

784
00:47:38,922 --> 00:47:44,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, just mostly light sevens or, you know, light seven to seven key songs.

785
00:47:44,925 --> 00:47:46,626
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not afraid of playing seven key.

786
00:47:46,646 --> 00:47:48,468
[SPEAKER_12]: I've got to play some more to get better at it.

787
00:47:48,568 --> 00:47:50,108
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's... Play more light seven.

788
00:47:50,329 --> 00:47:51,769
[SPEAKER_02]: Just, you know, just for the heck of it.

789
00:47:51,809 --> 00:47:52,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Just for the heck.

790
00:47:52,510 --> 00:48:00,114
[SPEAKER_12]: I would play... Now, see, light seven would be the kind of thing I would play to whore my VJ Army account up if I had one.

791
00:48:00,414 --> 00:48:01,695
[SPEAKER_12]: Hypothetically, if I had one.

792
00:48:01,735 --> 00:48:04,077
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd be all, look at all these triple A's I got.

793
00:48:04,097 --> 00:48:04,977
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course, it was on light seven.

794
00:48:04,997 --> 00:48:05,377
[SPEAKER_12]: But, man...

795
00:48:06,778 --> 00:48:09,981
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm good, because I know that there's people out there that do that.

796
00:48:10,181 --> 00:48:14,144
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, but that's okay, you know, light sevens are songs too, you have every right, but you know.

797
00:48:15,485 --> 00:48:17,446
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's another for random plus.

798
00:48:17,866 --> 00:48:20,829
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to play at least a hundred songs to unlock random plus.

799
00:48:21,149 --> 00:48:27,874
[SPEAKER_02]: And what exactly does random plus do again for those that... Random plus is where the turntable is now included in the shuffle.

800
00:48:28,834 --> 00:48:30,976
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, okay, I gotcha.

801
00:48:31,236 --> 00:48:36,160
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, that would be so hard if you got some scales that, oh god, that's crazy.

802
00:48:36,817 --> 00:48:40,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially, you know, especially Wargame.

803
00:48:41,301 --> 00:48:42,142
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate that song.

804
00:48:42,182 --> 00:48:43,262
[SPEAKER_12]: I can only imagine.

805
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:46,205
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, Wargame on 7-key was never a big problem for me.

806
00:48:46,245 --> 00:48:50,288
[SPEAKER_12]: For some reason, Scratching, I'm like, I'm okay with it.

807
00:48:50,629 --> 00:48:54,792
[SPEAKER_12]: Checking you out was the second 7-star I ever beat, and now I understand it's an 8-star.

808
00:48:55,173 --> 00:48:59,196
[SPEAKER_12]: So, like, I beat an 8-star, like, when I was beating my first 7-star.

809
00:48:59,216 --> 00:49:00,357
[SPEAKER_12]: That is so crazy to me.

810
00:49:00,597 --> 00:49:02,499
[SPEAKER_12]: But, for some reason, Scratching has never bothered me.

811
00:49:03,394 --> 00:49:12,079
[SPEAKER_02]: After you play 100 songs with random, just hold the whole key 2 and then wait for the random to go red.

812
00:49:13,239 --> 00:49:14,000
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's how it works?

813
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:15,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's how it works.

814
00:49:15,561 --> 00:49:20,063
[SPEAKER_12]: So those of you guys that are feeling a little crazy and want to play some random with the turntable, there you have it.

815
00:49:21,624 --> 00:49:21,964
[SPEAKER_12]: Interesting.

816
00:49:22,304 --> 00:49:25,626
[SPEAKER_12]: What would you say would be your favorite new video in 2DXA style?

817
00:49:26,407 --> 00:49:28,528
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen all of them because I'm really busy playing...

818
00:49:29,963 --> 00:49:31,143
[SPEAKER_02]: Playing the seven key songs.

819
00:49:31,523 --> 00:49:34,264
[SPEAKER_02]: But I say, I like Nebula Grasper a lot.

820
00:49:34,484 --> 00:49:36,264
[SPEAKER_12]: Nebula Grasper's got a pretty good video to it.

821
00:49:36,304 --> 00:49:38,925
[SPEAKER_12]: It's one of those futuristic, typical kind of things.

822
00:49:38,965 --> 00:49:41,185
[SPEAKER_12]: It kind of reminded me of Hyperboundary Yate a little bit.

823
00:49:41,225 --> 00:49:45,046
[SPEAKER_12]: Because, you know, that was an LED song too, and it had all the futuristic graphics with it.

824
00:49:45,286 --> 00:49:46,346
[SPEAKER_12]: Kind of reminded me of that a little bit.

825
00:49:47,006 --> 00:49:51,967
[SPEAKER_02]: And I bought a 2DX Red, so I really like Spiral Galaxy as well.

826
00:49:52,547 --> 00:49:57,448
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, were you able to get the V-Rare when you got... Oh, no, no, I didn't.

827
00:49:58,088 --> 00:49:59,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a regular one I ordered.

828
00:49:59,714 --> 00:49:59,974
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, okay.

829
00:50:00,975 --> 00:50:01,255
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

830
00:50:01,836 --> 00:50:03,758
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, anything else you want to share about 2DX ASO?

831
00:50:04,398 --> 00:50:05,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, nothing much else.

832
00:50:05,999 --> 00:50:06,280
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

833
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,061
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, we'll talk to you later then, I guess.

834
00:50:08,722 --> 00:50:09,362
[SPEAKER_12]: Have a good one, Siggy.

835
00:50:09,763 --> 00:50:10,023
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

836
00:50:10,063 --> 00:50:10,283
[SPEAKER_12]: Later.

837
00:50:10,423 --> 00:50:10,703
[SPEAKER_12]: Later.

838
00:50:11,804 --> 00:50:12,785
[SPEAKER_12]: I like getting phone calls.

839
00:50:12,825 --> 00:50:13,346
[SPEAKER_12]: That was fun.

840
00:50:14,366 --> 00:50:14,647
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

841
00:50:15,247 --> 00:50:18,109
[SPEAKER_12]: People say in our chat room right now is that they're talking about 2DX too much.

842
00:50:18,129 --> 00:50:21,012
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, it is the news that's going on right now, you know, you guys, but fine.

843
00:50:22,204 --> 00:50:23,706
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to talk about a little bit of DDR.

844
00:50:23,746 --> 00:50:27,751
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to try and get the I Feel, the new remix for you.

845
00:50:27,791 --> 00:50:30,995
[SPEAKER_12]: Loki's going to get that taken care of during the next break, right?

846
00:50:31,616 --> 00:50:31,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

847
00:50:32,217 --> 00:50:32,437
[SPEAKER_07]: Good.

848
00:50:32,557 --> 00:50:34,480
[SPEAKER_12]: Then I guess we're going to go to a break so we can get that song.

849
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:37,424
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to hear some music from DDR Festival, some more music.

850
00:50:37,444 --> 00:50:37,944
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, Jamie.

851
00:50:39,726 --> 00:50:39,907
[SPEAKER_12]: What?

852
00:50:41,628 --> 00:50:45,072
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll do the second mix break in a bit, but I want to get the festival stuff taken care of first.

853
00:50:45,432 --> 00:50:50,537
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, I did threaten the chat room with some Butterfly, and I know that's first mix, but I want to get that in there too, at some point.

854
00:50:50,598 --> 00:50:52,520
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll see what you can do.

855
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:56,524
[SPEAKER_12]: But in this break, a different version of Udorup.

856
00:50:57,224 --> 00:50:57,985
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't even say this.

857
00:50:58,025 --> 00:50:59,667
[SPEAKER_12]: You know the Captain Jack song from fifth mix?

858
00:50:59,787 --> 00:51:01,188
[SPEAKER_12]: Udorup, pom-pom-pom, or whatever, pom-pom-pom.

859
00:51:01,949 --> 00:51:04,391
[SPEAKER_07]: I need you I need you I need you

860
00:51:28,613 --> 00:51:29,433
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, that wasn't too bad.

861
00:51:29,554 --> 00:51:30,294
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, so we'll check it out.

862
00:51:30,314 --> 00:51:36,277
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to check out these songs, and we'll be back, and we're going to talk a little bit more about Ultramix 2, some of the news there, and play that new song from Ultramix 2.

863
00:51:36,437 --> 00:51:39,478
[SPEAKER_12]: And, of course, the Cage Match, FU's of the Week, all that good stuff coming up.

864
00:51:39,998 --> 00:51:46,101
[SPEAKER_12]: And in the chat room, they're saying, look, since you're so white, Sky, just say Dancine Pomponcolin.

865
00:51:46,541 --> 00:51:47,842
[SPEAKER_12]: And even that I can't say right.

866
00:51:48,162 --> 00:51:49,783
[SPEAKER_12]: I just, I wasn't cut out for radio.

867
00:51:49,823 --> 00:51:50,303
[SPEAKER_12]: What can I say?

868
00:51:50,783 --> 00:51:51,784
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll be back.

869
00:51:51,804 --> 00:51:52,084
[SPEAKER_12]: Crazy.

870
00:51:53,643 --> 00:51:57,026
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, we are going to be playing the new I Feel remix.

871
00:51:57,046 --> 00:51:59,267
[SPEAKER_12]: We ripped it during the break there.

872
00:51:59,327 --> 00:52:02,989
[SPEAKER_12]: Loki, our tech massa, is working on it right now, trying to get it all perfect.

873
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:15,137
[SPEAKER_12]: I said we should just rip it out of edit mode, but apparently if you try to rip it in edit mode, it cuts off the very beginning little speech thing, because it starts off with, like, it sounds like one of those speaking spells or something saying it.

874
00:52:15,757 --> 00:52:18,279
[SPEAKER_12]: And Loki was like, no, we can't have that!

875
00:52:18,539 --> 00:52:21,281
[SPEAKER_12]: So he made us go back and do it in edit mode, so whatever.

876
00:52:21,921 --> 00:52:22,501
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

877
00:52:49,386 --> 00:52:53,369
[SPEAKER_05]: That's Pump Up the Volume where I just go crazy and play whatever.

878
00:52:53,990 --> 00:52:56,312
[SPEAKER_05]: Although if you're in our chat room, you can make a request.

879
00:52:56,412 --> 00:52:58,934
[SPEAKER_05]: And if I think that it doesn't totally suck ass, I'll play it.

880
00:52:59,815 --> 00:53:00,335
[SPEAKER_12]: Amen to that.

881
00:53:01,256 --> 00:53:02,557
[SPEAKER_12]: And then Wednesday night.

882
00:53:03,695 --> 00:53:09,377
[SPEAKER_12]: as the oldie and moldy Orange Lounge radio show where basically we play a show from two years ago for your listening amusement.

883
00:53:09,737 --> 00:53:11,138
[SPEAKER_12]: Listen to how much we used to suck.

884
00:53:11,178 --> 00:53:13,759
[SPEAKER_12]: If you think we suck now, like we really sucked then.

885
00:53:14,939 --> 00:53:23,343
[SPEAKER_12]: And then Thursday nights, outside the box at 7 o'clock, myself, Rice Princess, and LankyStyle talking about the latest and greatest in video gaming.

886
00:53:23,643 --> 00:53:25,123
[SPEAKER_12]: This last week was a pretty good show.

887
00:53:25,163 --> 00:53:26,664
[SPEAKER_12]: You missed a good time if you missed this week.

888
00:53:26,724 --> 00:53:27,744
[SPEAKER_12]: We had a good time.

889
00:53:28,505 --> 00:53:29,365
[SPEAKER_12]: And then Friday nights,

890
00:53:29,744 --> 00:53:32,926
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not on this station, but it's over on The Freak on DDR Freak Radio.

891
00:53:32,966 --> 00:53:38,449
[SPEAKER_12]: The Rewinds, in case you missed a previous episode of Orange Lounge Radio, you can catch it over there, up to date.

892
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:44,173
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, the show they're going to be playing this Friday is last week's show, which was the one where we had the Middyhead interview.

893
00:53:44,573 --> 00:53:48,695
[SPEAKER_12]: If you guys missed the interview with Middyhead, awesome guy, awesome interview.

894
00:53:48,755 --> 00:53:51,117
[SPEAKER_12]: You have to check it out, so go listen to Freak on Friday.

895
00:53:51,197 --> 00:53:56,940
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, the karaoke cage match, by the way, was on last Friday, and of course, Loki won.

896
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:58,822
[SPEAKER_12]: Was there any surprise in anyone's mind?

897
00:53:58,982 --> 00:53:59,462
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think so.

898
00:54:01,195 --> 00:54:05,218
[SPEAKER_12]: I've got to plug the LiveJournal community because we haven't plugged that in a while.

899
00:54:05,998 --> 00:54:13,964
[SPEAKER_12]: If you guys have a LiveJournal, which I know a lot of you do in this day and age, we're starting to move into a LiveJournally-centered internet, head on over to our LiveJournal community.

900
00:54:14,024 --> 00:54:15,985
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just username OrangeLounge on LiveJournal.

901
00:54:16,285 --> 00:54:19,748
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you join it, you get some of the latest announcements on what's going on in the station.

902
00:54:20,068 --> 00:54:25,552
[SPEAKER_12]: Sometimes we propose ideas for changes to the station on our LiveJournal and we get your feedback there.

903
00:54:25,632 --> 00:54:27,193
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's just a nice little community.

904
00:54:27,453 --> 00:54:29,875
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a way for you to meet other listeners of OrangeLounge Radio.

905
00:54:30,695 --> 00:54:31,596
[SPEAKER_12]: Crazy people like us.

906
00:54:33,718 --> 00:54:34,079
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see.

907
00:54:34,539 --> 00:54:35,340
[SPEAKER_12]: DDR Ultramix 2.

908
00:54:36,101 --> 00:54:38,884
[SPEAKER_12]: It's been a game we've been talking about a hell of a lot lately, I gotta say.

909
00:54:38,944 --> 00:54:41,947
[SPEAKER_12]: But SongPack... I keep calling it Service Pack.

910
00:54:42,327 --> 00:54:44,129
[SPEAKER_12]: SongPack 7 came out this week.

911
00:54:44,189 --> 00:54:44,650
[SPEAKER_12]: Finally...

912
00:54:45,134 --> 00:54:50,759
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot of us were expecting that SongPack 7 was going to be out when the game came out, but for whatever reason there was a delay.

913
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:54,023
[SPEAKER_12]: Sounds like there might have been some kind of bug that prevented things.

914
00:54:54,143 --> 00:54:54,463
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

915
00:54:55,004 --> 00:54:59,288
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot of people bitchin' and moanin' because SongPack 7 has a lot of old songs in it.

916
00:54:59,308 --> 00:55:00,969
[SPEAKER_12]: We were talking about this a little bit last week.

917
00:55:01,730 --> 00:55:05,714
[SPEAKER_12]: But SongPack 7 has End of the Century and Lost in Eurita and Silent Hill.

918
00:55:06,375 --> 00:55:09,277
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot of old classic DDR songs.

919
00:55:10,018 --> 00:55:12,298
[SPEAKER_12]: But I guess played out to a lot of people as well.

920
00:55:12,619 --> 00:55:13,219
[SPEAKER_12]: Era as well.

921
00:55:13,479 --> 00:55:17,419
[SPEAKER_12]: So you get some tack finally in DDR Ultimate Mix 2.

922
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,360
[SPEAKER_12]: But a lot of these songs, since they're old, they're kind of played out.

923
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:25,061
[SPEAKER_12]: So they're getting a lot of kind of negative feedback from folks out there.

924
00:55:25,141 --> 00:55:29,262
[SPEAKER_12]: Even though, I don't know, I think it's kind of neat because A, you get them 60 frames a second.

925
00:55:29,382 --> 00:55:31,422
[SPEAKER_12]: B, you can play them on Xbox Live now.

926
00:55:31,862 --> 00:55:34,382
[SPEAKER_12]: Not that I'm a huge fan of any of the songs really.

927
00:55:34,602 --> 00:55:36,103
[SPEAKER_12]: I like Era, don't get me wrong, I love Era.

928
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:36,783
[SPEAKER_12]: Um...

929
00:55:38,103 --> 00:55:45,327
[SPEAKER_12]: But then there's this new remix of I Feel, the Junk Circuit mix, which is pretty interesting because Junk Circuit is another artist that's over on a different drum.

930
00:55:45,367 --> 00:55:48,808
[SPEAKER_12]: The background for this song has the website address.

931
00:55:49,129 --> 00:55:57,353
[SPEAKER_12]: You may have noticed a lot of the different drum songs, like the Jesper Kidd, a lot of the new songs in Ultramix 2 have websites in their backgrounds.

932
00:55:57,373 --> 00:55:59,814
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's kind of interesting that we're getting those in some of the song packs as well.

933
00:56:01,114 --> 00:56:01,415
[SPEAKER_12]: But...

934
00:56:02,735 --> 00:56:14,042
[SPEAKER_12]: I think in visiting Junk Circuit's website, I think there's actually a lot in common between Junk Circuit and Nuropa, who does the song Standing Still in Time, because they have the same website contact email.

935
00:56:14,082 --> 00:56:15,403
[SPEAKER_12]: So, kind of interesting.

936
00:56:16,043 --> 00:56:16,303
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright.

937
00:56:17,364 --> 00:56:17,644
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway.

938
00:56:18,505 --> 00:56:22,067
[SPEAKER_12]: They're telling us in the chatroom to stop talking about the song and play the damn thing already.

939
00:56:22,107 --> 00:56:22,567
[SPEAKER_12]: That's fine.

940
00:56:22,587 --> 00:56:23,147
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll get to it.

941
00:56:23,227 --> 00:56:24,568
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to copy it over right now.

942
00:56:25,008 --> 00:56:28,450
[SPEAKER_12]: Loki's put the finishing touches on it, so we'll go ahead and play that for you.

943
00:56:28,791 --> 00:56:30,912
[SPEAKER_12]: But really first, Loki, what did you think of this remix?

944
00:56:31,949 --> 00:56:36,053
[SPEAKER_11]: I do like this one a little bit better too, but I kind of like the old one as well.

945
00:56:36,073 --> 00:56:36,554
[SPEAKER_11]: I gotta admit.

946
00:56:36,874 --> 00:56:37,194
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

947
00:56:37,215 --> 00:56:38,015
[SPEAKER_11]: What do I know?

948
00:56:38,035 --> 00:56:38,196
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

949
00:56:38,376 --> 00:56:39,177
[SPEAKER_11]: I gotta copy it over.

950
00:56:56,041 --> 00:56:59,082
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess there was a big tournament on Ultramix 2 tonight, online.

951
00:56:59,622 --> 00:57:01,543
[SPEAKER_12]: There was a lot of people talking about it over on DDR Freak.

952
00:57:01,723 --> 00:57:02,303
[SPEAKER_12]: I missed it.

953
00:57:03,003 --> 00:57:07,564
[SPEAKER_12]: It wasn't something... I knew I'd get my ass kicked, so I didn't want to participate, but I guess it went pretty well from what I hear.

954
00:57:08,484 --> 00:57:10,685
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, I'll stop talking and start playing.

955
00:57:10,745 --> 00:57:11,425
[SPEAKER_12]: Here it is.

956
00:57:11,825 --> 00:57:14,606
[SPEAKER_12]: Orange Launch Radio presents the brand new I Feel remix.

957
00:57:14,666 --> 00:57:15,806
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the Junk Circuit mix.

958
00:57:16,007 --> 00:57:16,487
[SPEAKER_12]: Enjoy, guys.

959
00:57:17,227 --> 00:57:21,848
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you feel it?

960
00:57:22,628 --> 00:57:23,048
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura?

961
00:57:23,089 --> 00:57:23,709
[SPEAKER_12]: Who did that again?

962
00:57:23,729 --> 00:57:24,749
[SPEAKER_12]: That was Junk Circuit.

963
00:57:25,516 --> 00:57:27,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I like the original better.

964
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:30,765
[SPEAKER_12]: I think a lot of us can agree that the original is a little bit better.

965
00:57:30,825 --> 00:57:32,067
[SPEAKER_12]: Nothing ever tops the original.

966
00:57:32,087 --> 00:57:33,509
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like when you remake old movies.

967
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:35,973
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, Loki says it does top the original.

968
00:57:36,253 --> 00:57:37,155
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I disagree!

969
00:57:38,055 --> 00:57:39,196
[SPEAKER_12]: Nothing tops the Kiryamoga.

970
00:57:39,716 --> 00:57:40,656
[SPEAKER_12]: What'd you think of that, Bradley?

971
00:57:40,696 --> 00:57:45,379
[SPEAKER_10]: I liked it, except I think that the... I feel that little... Hold the bottom of the mic here.

972
00:57:45,579 --> 00:57:46,319
[SPEAKER_12]: It's breaking up a little bit.

973
00:57:46,339 --> 00:57:46,899
[SPEAKER_12]: The cord's loose.

974
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:47,580
[SPEAKER_12]: That's alright.

975
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:48,140
[SPEAKER_12]: We're ghetto here.

976
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:49,081
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't have good equipment.

977
00:57:49,901 --> 00:57:51,022
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, now you're cutting out completely.

978
00:57:52,182 --> 00:57:52,522
[SPEAKER_12]: There you are.

979
00:57:52,682 --> 00:57:52,963
[SPEAKER_12]: Am I here?

980
00:57:53,103 --> 00:57:53,703
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, you're here.

981
00:57:54,103 --> 00:57:54,303
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

982
00:57:54,483 --> 00:57:55,224
[SPEAKER_14]: Now you're gone again!

983
00:57:58,886 --> 00:57:59,046
[SPEAKER_12]: Nope.

984
00:58:00,126 --> 00:58:01,387
[SPEAKER_12]: We need to buy a new mic, I think.

985
00:58:01,427 --> 00:58:01,967
[SPEAKER_12]: Something's going on.

986
00:58:02,467 --> 00:58:03,588
[SPEAKER_12]: Steal this one real fast.

987
00:58:05,270 --> 00:58:06,991
[SPEAKER_12]: Yo, that one's dying.

988
00:58:08,491 --> 00:58:09,632
[SPEAKER_12]: I cried for that microphone.

989
00:58:11,032 --> 00:58:12,573
[SPEAKER_12]: There we go, try that one.

990
00:58:12,853 --> 00:58:14,354
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that was pretty good.

991
00:58:14,934 --> 00:58:19,856
[SPEAKER_10]: Except for, I think, that little computer I feel it voices is a bad touch.

992
00:58:20,716 --> 00:58:22,157
[SPEAKER_10]: If they left it out, it would make it better.

993
00:58:22,677 --> 00:58:24,017
[SPEAKER_12]: Jazz in our chatroom agrees with you.

994
00:58:24,057 --> 00:58:27,958
[SPEAKER_12]: He says the whole, can you feel it, samples just sounds fucking cheesy, is what he says.

995
00:58:28,419 --> 00:58:28,639
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

996
00:58:29,219 --> 00:58:31,219
[SPEAKER_12]: And Jamie's yelling from the laundry room that she agrees.

997
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:33,460
[SPEAKER_12]: So overall, I like it.

998
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:35,380
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I think it's pretty good.

999
00:58:35,761 --> 00:58:41,882
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the, can you feel it, is a little weird, but it, I don't know, it's different.

1000
00:58:42,502 --> 00:58:43,843
[SPEAKER_12]: I give him points for trying.

1001
00:58:43,903 --> 00:58:45,343
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a good remix.

1002
00:58:45,403 --> 00:58:46,363
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a fun song to play.

1003
00:58:48,264 --> 00:58:49,184
[SPEAKER_12]: The steps are kind of interesting.

1004
00:58:49,204 --> 00:58:51,645
[SPEAKER_13]: It took something good and added a bunch of extraneous crap to it.

1005
00:58:53,257 --> 00:58:55,779
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there any DDR remix that you've liked so far?

1006
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:01,382
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked the What's-His-Face one that you interviewed last week.

1007
00:59:01,402 --> 00:59:01,823
[SPEAKER_12]: MidiHead?

1008
00:59:02,043 --> 00:59:02,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1009
00:59:02,443 --> 00:59:02,723
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1010
00:59:02,743 --> 00:59:04,004
[SPEAKER_05]: That one was good.

1011
00:59:04,464 --> 00:59:04,764
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright.

1012
00:59:06,145 --> 00:59:06,906
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, What's-His-Face.

1013
00:59:08,767 --> 00:59:09,627
[SPEAKER_12]: I wasn't here!

1014
00:59:12,749 --> 00:59:13,711
[SPEAKER_12]: I wasn't here!

1015
00:59:31,292 --> 00:59:34,454
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a little sticky announcement thingy where you can ask me to hit a question.

1016
00:59:34,474 --> 00:59:42,959
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you missed getting your question last week, because we took some questions from our listeners, but if you missed your chance to ask me to hit a question, they are taking question submissions right now.

1017
00:59:43,019 --> 00:59:44,580
[SPEAKER_12]: So go check that out if you'd like.

1018
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,261
[SPEAKER_12]: What did you think of that remix, Angel?

1019
00:59:46,581 --> 00:59:49,042
[SPEAKER_12]: You like everything, so I know you're going to have something good to say about it.

1020
00:59:50,763 --> 00:59:56,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I liked the first one from Silent Hill when we first did that one.

1021
00:59:56,987 --> 00:59:58,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Then when the other one came out, I liked that one.

1022
00:59:58,628 --> 01:00:00,469
[SPEAKER_04]: So what do you think my answer is going to be this time?

1023
01:00:01,348 --> 01:00:01,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.

1024
01:00:02,588 --> 01:00:03,029
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think?

1025
01:00:03,809 --> 01:00:04,089
[SPEAKER_12]: Ten?

1026
01:00:04,709 --> 01:00:04,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1027
01:00:06,370 --> 01:00:07,390
[SPEAKER_12]: You're such a Bobani whore.

1028
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:07,850
[SPEAKER_12]: I love it.

1029
01:00:11,352 --> 01:00:11,752
[SPEAKER_12]: What?

1030
01:00:13,252 --> 01:00:14,253
[SPEAKER_11]: You called her a whore.

1031
01:00:15,872 --> 01:00:17,354
[SPEAKER_12]: You make it sound like it's the first time.

1032
01:00:17,434 --> 01:00:17,735
[SPEAKER_12]: Come on.

1033
01:00:18,396 --> 01:00:18,716
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

1034
01:00:20,699 --> 01:00:22,861
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to take some calls on the Skype line.

1035
01:00:22,882 --> 01:00:27,888
[SPEAKER_12]: If you want to give us a call, head on over to www.OrangeLaunchRadio.com and click on Interact With Us.

1036
01:00:28,269 --> 01:00:33,756
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm kind of curious about some of your guys' feedback on Ultra Mix 2, specifically Song Pack 7, if you've had a chance to check it out.

1037
01:00:34,276 --> 01:00:49,127
[SPEAKER_12]: Any online experiences you might have had on Ultramix 2, and even if you want to talk about a DDR Festival, because we haven't talked a whole lot about DDR Festival, and that's just because none of us in Sacramento, I don't think a single person in Sacramento that I know of anyway has bought the game, so we don't know what to say about it.

1038
01:00:50,028 --> 01:00:52,870
[SPEAKER_11]: And to add to that, if you'd like to talk about Drawn Together as well.

1039
01:00:54,151 --> 01:00:54,952
[SPEAKER_12]: No, that's not...

1040
01:00:59,176 --> 01:01:01,898
[SPEAKER_12]: I have an opinion.

1041
01:01:01,918 --> 01:01:02,279
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I don't.

1042
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:04,400
[SPEAKER_12]: Shut up.

1043
01:01:06,262 --> 01:01:08,083
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you ever get a chance to play Ultramix 2, Jamie?

1044
01:01:08,143 --> 01:01:09,945
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you guys pick that up at your place yet?

1045
01:01:10,285 --> 01:01:10,565
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

1046
01:01:10,805 --> 01:01:10,965
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

1047
01:01:11,045 --> 01:01:11,646
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you going to get it?

1048
01:01:13,757 --> 01:01:14,218
[SPEAKER_13]: It's fun.

1049
01:01:14,498 --> 01:01:15,479
[SPEAKER_13]: Dot, dot, dot.

1050
01:01:15,519 --> 01:01:16,220
[SPEAKER_13]: It's fun!

1051
01:01:16,981 --> 01:01:17,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

1052
01:01:17,682 --> 01:01:18,143
[SPEAKER_13]: You should.

1053
01:01:18,363 --> 01:01:21,507
[SPEAKER_05]: The house has been rearranged in Halo 2 land position.

1054
01:01:22,568 --> 01:01:25,032
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no room to put any dance pads or anything.

1055
01:01:25,953 --> 01:01:26,854
[SPEAKER_13]: Look at this place!

1056
01:01:27,094 --> 01:01:28,196
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello, you can sit on our camp.

1057
01:01:28,216 --> 01:01:29,277
[SPEAKER_13]: You have infinitely more room.

1058
01:01:29,337 --> 01:01:29,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan's got the...

1059
01:01:31,454 --> 01:01:38,699
[SPEAKER_05]: Normally in my living room we have the TV on one wall, the couch on one wall, and the loveseat back on the far wall.

1060
01:01:39,379 --> 01:01:46,984
[SPEAKER_05]: Well now the loveseat and couch are back to back with just enough room to have a place to put your legs and an Xbox between TVs.

1061
01:01:47,945 --> 01:01:49,486
[SPEAKER_05]: It is currently in LAN mode.

1062
01:01:50,086 --> 01:01:53,408
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you guys hosting a bunch of Halo 2 parties or something?

1063
01:01:53,428 --> 01:01:55,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan did on his birthday on Monday.

1064
01:01:55,270 --> 01:01:56,370
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, his birthday was Monday, huh?

1065
01:01:56,390 --> 01:01:56,670
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1066
01:01:56,750 --> 01:01:57,451
[SPEAKER_12]: Happy birthday, Dan.

1067
01:01:58,326 --> 01:01:59,306
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't here for that.

1068
01:02:00,127 --> 01:02:01,427
[SPEAKER_05]: He told me I should feel guilty.

1069
01:02:02,668 --> 01:02:03,568
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, now that's not true.

1070
01:02:06,129 --> 01:02:06,669
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not true.

1071
01:02:10,171 --> 01:02:12,912
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I don't think anybody's calling us on the Skype line, so what can we do?

1072
01:02:13,592 --> 01:02:14,512
[SPEAKER_12]: Damn it, they suck!

1073
01:02:14,552 --> 01:02:17,534
[SPEAKER_12]: Except now they're talking about drawn together in our chat room.

1074
01:02:17,994 --> 01:02:19,654
[SPEAKER_12]: You freaking ass, Loki.

1075
01:02:20,695 --> 01:02:21,015
[SPEAKER_12]: Jerk.

1076
01:02:22,273 --> 01:02:29,517
[SPEAKER_12]: Loki, now you keep telling me that you're going to start playing Ultramix 2 because I notice that every time I've been playing it, you're like, yeah, I need to play that.

1077
01:02:30,377 --> 01:02:31,558
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I need to play that.

1078
01:02:32,158 --> 01:02:33,139
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you actually going to be playing?

1079
01:02:33,199 --> 01:02:34,399
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, we're finally getting a call.

1080
01:02:35,140 --> 01:02:39,842
[SPEAKER_12]: You're going to reprieve for now, but as soon as this call is done, we're going to ask you about that.

1081
01:02:40,142 --> 01:02:41,483
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1082
01:02:43,024 --> 01:02:43,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Legend of Zaku here.

1083
01:02:44,164 --> 01:02:44,765
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, Zaku.

1084
01:02:44,825 --> 01:02:45,165
[SPEAKER_12]: How are you?

1085
01:02:45,908 --> 01:02:50,790
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have that much to share because, you know, as I said, you know, I'm a college student.

1086
01:02:50,830 --> 01:02:51,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Then get off the phone!

1087
01:02:52,550 --> 01:02:54,471
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have a PS2 or an Xbox.

1088
01:02:54,531 --> 01:02:58,253
[SPEAKER_03]: I might get one this Christmas, but I'm kind of iffy on which one should I get.

1089
01:02:58,933 --> 01:03:00,173
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Bomani-wise, that is.

1090
01:03:00,273 --> 01:03:02,014
[SPEAKER_12]: So you don't have a PS2 or an Xbox.

1091
01:03:02,034 --> 01:03:06,136
[SPEAKER_12]: So you're asking the age-old question, which system should I get?

1092
01:03:06,416 --> 01:03:10,357
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but with regards to not only, you know, games, but also Bomani as well.

1093
01:03:11,738 --> 01:03:12,758
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm adding a little kick to that.

1094
01:03:16,875 --> 01:03:19,217
[SPEAKER_11]: And you have nothing to add about Drawn Together.

1095
01:03:35,123 --> 01:03:36,964
[SPEAKER_12]: Something that's going to remind you of the arcade.

1096
01:03:37,164 --> 01:03:39,804
[SPEAKER_12]: Something that's going to bring the arcade experience to the home.

1097
01:03:40,164 --> 01:03:42,365
[SPEAKER_12]: Something where there's a lot of different songs available.

1098
01:03:42,745 --> 01:03:45,386
[SPEAKER_12]: Something with iToy support if you want to get your hands involved.

1099
01:03:45,706 --> 01:03:46,466
[SPEAKER_12]: Go for the PS2.

1100
01:03:47,507 --> 01:03:54,009
[SPEAKER_12]: If you want to get something where you can play online and you want to play against other people that live around, go for the Xbox.

1101
01:03:54,089 --> 01:03:54,729
[SPEAKER_12]: But here's the thing.

1102
01:03:54,989 --> 01:03:59,950
[SPEAKER_12]: You being the starving college student, that means you're going to have to pay for the Xbox, Xbox Live, and then five bucks a song pack.

1103
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:02,451
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know.

1104
01:04:03,361 --> 01:04:06,242
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but also with the PS2 I might have to mod it

1105
01:04:07,011 --> 01:04:11,234
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to mod if I'm going to play 2DX or any of those lovely Pomani games besides DDR.

1106
01:04:11,314 --> 01:04:15,896
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, that's very true, and that's going to cost you money as well, I mean, if you want to play the Japanese game.

1107
01:04:16,237 --> 01:04:23,941
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's the other thing, if you plan on modding your PS2, which, you know, can have mixed results, I guess I hear now it's pretty easy to mod it.

1108
01:04:23,981 --> 01:04:24,842
[SPEAKER_03]: I live in the city.

1109
01:04:24,862 --> 01:04:25,002
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

1110
01:04:25,042 --> 01:04:25,822
[SPEAKER_03]: I live in the city.

1111
01:04:25,902 --> 01:04:28,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Chinatown's not that far, and I can always get it modded there.

1112
01:04:28,264 --> 01:04:28,784
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, alright.

1113
01:04:29,144 --> 01:04:29,505
[SPEAKER_12]: Fair enough.

1114
01:04:29,565 --> 01:04:30,685
[SPEAKER_12]: So you can get a modded PS2.

1115
01:04:30,725 --> 01:04:34,708
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you're interested in 2DX or Poppin' or any of that stuff, you're definitely going to want to get the PS2.

1116
01:04:36,050 --> 01:04:37,251
[SPEAKER_12]: Here's the other thing to consider, too.

1117
01:04:39,092 --> 01:04:43,954
[SPEAKER_12]: We have PS3 and Xbox 2 likely to be out in stores before next Christmas.

1118
01:04:43,974 --> 01:04:54,660
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't know for sure, but if I were a betting man, I would say those things are going to be in stores next Christmas, which means the systems that are out there now, their prices will be halved, or they'll be $100 or less.

1119
01:04:56,521 --> 01:05:08,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I probably already took notice of that, and I think 9th style, if it does come out next year for PS2, I don't know if it's going to jump into the next console, it'll just be the last PS2 2DX game.

1120
01:05:08,625 --> 01:05:13,327
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm kind of hoping that there is a 9th style and a 10th style pretty back-to-back.

1121
01:05:13,427 --> 01:05:16,588
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm kind of hoping that those games come out pretty quickly.

1122
01:05:16,708 --> 01:05:19,649
[SPEAKER_03]: PS2, or just one for PS2 and the next for PS3?

1123
01:05:20,150 --> 01:05:20,670
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope they both...

1124
01:05:21,890 --> 01:05:28,473
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's given that PS3 will play PS2 games, so they ought to just both come out for PS2.

1125
01:05:29,214 --> 01:05:37,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, seeing as, you know, I already noticed that 2DX games come out, you know, there's always 2DX games coming out for PS2 every single year.

1126
01:05:38,538 --> 01:05:45,501
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically, from what I'm speculating, from what I'm predicting, Night Style might come out in May next year or something, or near the summer.

1127
01:05:45,741 --> 01:05:46,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

1128
01:05:47,222 --> 01:05:47,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody really knows.

1129
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:49,123
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just taking a guess here.

1130
01:05:49,143 --> 01:05:49,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, taking a shot.

1131
01:05:49,683 --> 01:05:50,864
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just taking an educated guess from...

1132
01:05:52,455 --> 01:05:56,037
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, alright, I think pretty much I... Well, you know what?

1133
01:05:56,557 --> 01:06:06,263
[SPEAKER_12]: Then again, 9th style would make a lot of sense on PlayStation 3 because then they could fuck up the timing by putting it on a new system, just like the arcade ones.

1134
01:06:06,843 --> 01:06:16,208
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I get a PS2 for Bomani, I'm going to have to pay money for the 2DX controller, poppin' music, so it's going to be equally the same if I'm going to have to try going after both.

1135
01:06:17,042 --> 01:06:23,583
[SPEAKER_03]: because one will have more peripherals and the other will have more services and things to buy.

1136
01:06:23,803 --> 01:06:29,124
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, also to even confuse things even more, there's also the Phantom console that's coming out.

1137
01:06:31,205 --> 01:06:31,965
[SPEAKER_11]: How is that confusing?

1138
01:06:32,145 --> 01:06:33,845
[SPEAKER_11]: Who gives a shit about the Phantom?

1139
01:06:33,925 --> 01:06:34,485
[SPEAKER_12]: Seriously.

1140
01:06:35,645 --> 01:06:36,125
[SPEAKER_12]: What's that?

1141
01:06:37,986 --> 01:06:39,266
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly, exactly.

1142
01:06:39,486 --> 01:06:42,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I've got pictures of them on orangeonradio.com.

1143
01:06:42,567 --> 01:06:43,187
[SPEAKER_05]: And I hear rumors of a...

1144
01:06:45,965 --> 01:06:47,566
[SPEAKER_11]: Engage2, that's shaped like a banana.

1145
01:06:48,726 --> 01:06:51,267
[SPEAKER_05]: I have rumors.

1146
01:06:51,527 --> 01:06:53,268
[SPEAKER_12]: I've heard rumors about foul women.

1147
01:06:53,308 --> 01:06:55,048
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm about to have after this show.

1148
01:06:58,509 --> 01:06:59,430
[SPEAKER_12]: Here's the thing, though.

1149
01:06:59,490 --> 01:07:02,211
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're looking for a system for Bomani, don't get a GameCube.

1150
01:07:03,311 --> 01:07:03,771
[SPEAKER_12]: GameCube?

1151
01:07:03,811 --> 01:07:04,372
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course not.

1152
01:07:04,432 --> 01:07:04,892
[SPEAKER_12]: Hell no.

1153
01:07:04,912 --> 01:07:06,172
[SPEAKER_12]: GameCube's not worth the money.

1154
01:07:06,292 --> 01:07:06,812
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the best.

1155
01:07:06,952 --> 01:07:09,013
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, don't you be knocking the GameCube.

1156
01:07:09,053 --> 01:07:09,874
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a beautiful system.

1157
01:07:09,894 --> 01:07:10,754
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not knocking the GameCube.

1158
01:07:11,374 --> 01:07:15,578
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's cheap, but I mean... Don't make me come out there and cut you, because I will.

1159
01:07:15,718 --> 01:07:15,919
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1160
01:07:16,019 --> 01:07:17,700
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to travel 3,000 miles?

1161
01:07:17,740 --> 01:07:18,321
[SPEAKER_03]: To cut you?

1162
01:07:18,541 --> 01:07:19,442
[SPEAKER_12]: To cut you, yes.

1163
01:07:19,983 --> 01:07:23,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you even know where in New York do I live?

1164
01:07:23,126 --> 01:07:24,127
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll send my minions.

1165
01:07:25,068 --> 01:07:25,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sure.

1166
01:07:26,529 --> 01:07:28,671
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, do you want a cookie for that, Scott?

1167
01:07:29,112 --> 01:07:30,493
[SPEAKER_03]: We can track your IP!

1168
01:07:30,833 --> 01:07:31,294
[SPEAKER_12]: That's right.

1169
01:07:31,794 --> 01:07:33,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1170
01:07:33,236 --> 01:07:35,358
[SPEAKER_12]: Live365 has it all on record, I think.

1171
01:07:36,072 --> 01:07:37,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

1172
01:08:01,468 --> 01:08:02,570
[SPEAKER_12]: Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match

1173
01:08:15,990 --> 01:08:20,856
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been perusing some of the message forums out there lately, DDR Freak namely being one of them.

1174
01:08:21,217 --> 01:08:24,741
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought there was this very interesting thread over there in Random Chat.

1175
01:08:24,761 --> 01:08:27,585
[SPEAKER_12]: You know how they do a lot of really crazy stuff over in Random Chat?

1176
01:08:27,885 --> 01:08:29,387
[SPEAKER_12]: You know the Random Chat stuff, right?

1177
01:08:29,647 --> 01:08:30,668
[SPEAKER_12]: Right, DarkSakura?

1178
01:08:31,149 --> 01:08:32,230
[SPEAKER_12]: Being a mod over there and everything?

1179
01:08:34,633 --> 01:08:34,834
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1180
01:08:35,414 --> 01:08:37,755
[SPEAKER_11]: What's this random that you talk about?

1181
01:08:38,835 --> 01:08:40,615
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't know anything about random on this show.

1182
01:08:41,675 --> 01:08:52,718
[SPEAKER_12]: Just out of curiosity, this is total tangent, but since I'm thinking DarkSakura here and how much she loves to lock topics over there, what would you say would be the most favorite topic you've gotten to lock on random chat?

1183
01:08:55,498 --> 01:08:56,639
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, please lock this.

1184
01:08:58,339 --> 01:08:58,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1185
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:01,940
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had a please lock this before.

1186
01:09:07,875 --> 01:09:12,537
[SPEAKER_12]: There's an interesting topic going on there in random chats called, do you actually play DDR anymore?

1187
01:09:13,157 --> 01:09:18,120
[SPEAKER_12]: And I thought it was kind of interesting just seeing how many people actually don't play DDR anymore.

1188
01:09:18,461 --> 01:09:23,904
[SPEAKER_12]: So I kind of was going to go around the room a little bit and see, do you play DDR anymore?

1189
01:09:24,824 --> 01:09:27,746
[SPEAKER_12]: And if not, why are you doing this show?

1190
01:09:30,207 --> 01:09:30,728
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll start.

1191
01:09:31,329 --> 01:09:32,331
[SPEAKER_12]: Do I play DDR anymore?

1192
01:09:32,451 --> 01:09:34,333
[SPEAKER_12]: A little bit, not as much nearly as I used to.

1193
01:09:34,534 --> 01:09:36,457
[SPEAKER_12]: I play a little bit of Ultramix 2 at home.

1194
01:09:36,997 --> 01:09:39,040
[SPEAKER_12]: Most of my DDR playing is controller controller.

1195
01:09:39,982 --> 01:09:44,749
[SPEAKER_12]: The reason why I don't play DDR that much anymore is because the quality of arcades in this area went downhill significantly.

1196
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:49,452
[SPEAKER_12]: Kenami of Japan can suck it for not putting out a new mix in a long time.

1197
01:09:49,492 --> 01:09:53,015
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that has a lot to do with the reason why I haven't played DDR in a long time.

1198
01:09:54,396 --> 01:10:01,301
[SPEAKER_12]: The home version is the only thing keeping it alive to me, but I just can't motivate my fat ass to pull out the ignition pad.

1199
01:10:02,021 --> 01:10:05,583
[SPEAKER_12]: As good of a dance pad as it is, it's still not the arcade.

1200
01:10:06,083 --> 01:10:10,246
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to play DDR in the arcade, and there's no good arcade mix.

1201
01:10:10,446 --> 01:10:15,628
[SPEAKER_12]: And yes, I realize there was that Stepmania thing, but to me, it's still only 90%.

1202
01:10:17,009 --> 01:10:19,050
[SPEAKER_12]: And the damn thing broke in a week anyway.

1203
01:10:19,290 --> 01:10:21,412
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's still not everything that DDR is.

1204
01:10:21,472 --> 01:10:22,252
[SPEAKER_12]: It's still got issues.

1205
01:10:22,772 --> 01:10:26,494
[SPEAKER_12]: And in the groove, it's okay, but...

1206
01:10:28,155 --> 01:10:31,497
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, just, you know, ego killed the video game star, I guess.

1207
01:10:33,218 --> 01:10:35,140
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, do you play DDR anymore?

1208
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:37,561
[SPEAKER_13]: I played DDR when I was in Alabama.

1209
01:10:38,522 --> 01:10:39,142
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, there you go.

1210
01:10:39,703 --> 01:10:41,464
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you play it regularly besides that?

1211
01:10:41,564 --> 01:10:43,425
[SPEAKER_05]: When I'm somewhere that has a machine, I'll play.

1212
01:10:45,086 --> 01:10:48,188
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got more reason to play now than I go play dock at RVGL.

1213
01:10:49,449 --> 01:10:51,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I'll still have a little bit of money and go play some DDR.

1214
01:10:52,310 --> 01:10:58,776
[SPEAKER_12]: I played like one game of DDR when I went to go play Doc at Derby Owner's Club over at Roseville Golf Land, but here's the problem, I fucking failed Breakdown!

1215
01:10:58,956 --> 01:11:12,649
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, you know, it's a 9-footer, it's a more difficult song at the end of the scale, but you have to remember, I'm somebody who was playing DDR religiously for quite some time, and, you know, I... I just... It just makes me sad how much stamina I've lost, you know?

1216
01:11:13,891 --> 01:11:14,211
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright.

1217
01:11:14,591 --> 01:11:16,373
[SPEAKER_12]: Arcadian, do you actually play DDR anymore?

1218
01:11:18,041 --> 01:11:24,563
[SPEAKER_10]: Not really, just mainly because my foot's been hurting, and because I haven't had that much money lately.

1219
01:11:25,343 --> 01:11:30,525
[SPEAKER_10]: Now I might be able to go once my foot feels 100%, or 90% at least.

1220
01:11:31,646 --> 01:11:37,387
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe more in the future, because it's been so long and I need to get off my fat ass when I sit around too much.

1221
01:11:41,049 --> 01:11:42,689
[SPEAKER_12]: Loki, do you play DDR anymore?

1222
01:11:43,770 --> 01:11:44,850
[SPEAKER_12]: DDR and Final Fantasy XI?

1223
01:11:47,991 --> 01:11:53,134
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, yes I do, I'm Step Mania every once in a while, I'll play it.

1224
01:11:53,975 --> 01:12:05,422
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, but yes, to answer your question earlier, um, about you, you know, Xbox and stuff and if I was ever going to play it, no, because I'm going to actually set up my Step Mania cabinet to be playing some stuff.

1225
01:12:05,462 --> 01:12:11,326
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, that's why I bought crap today to cut the other, um, control panel for the actual, you know, select arrows and stuff.

1226
01:12:11,946 --> 01:12:14,748
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why, um, I was going to do that today.

1227
01:12:14,768 --> 01:12:16,529
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm hopefully going to build that this week because I bought...

1228
01:12:17,089 --> 01:12:23,832
[SPEAKER_11]: A while back, a new IPAC thing to hook it all up, and I have to see if it's going to get fried as easy as the other one.

1229
01:12:24,412 --> 01:12:29,014
[SPEAKER_11]: So, it's all contingent on that, whether I get to play it some more.

1230
01:12:29,254 --> 01:12:38,958
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't play in the arcade, because the arcade's too far away, takes too much of my time, cuts into my Final Fantasy XI time, and the arcade's broken all the time.

1231
01:12:40,298 --> 01:12:41,639
[SPEAKER_11]: Not in a way fucking out of shape.

1232
01:12:41,779 --> 01:12:44,741
[SPEAKER_11]: I go and play like a seven footer on doubles and I'm ready to die.

1233
01:12:45,442 --> 01:12:47,263
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, whatever happened to me.

1234
01:12:48,243 --> 01:12:48,964
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I want to know.

1235
01:12:49,384 --> 01:12:50,345
[SPEAKER_11]: It never used to be this hard.

1236
01:12:50,925 --> 01:12:53,507
[SPEAKER_11]: But once I get back in shape, yeah, I'd play a lot more.

1237
01:12:53,527 --> 01:12:59,951
[SPEAKER_11]: I just need to finish my arcade cabinets before I move out of here, so that's priority one.

1238
01:13:02,757 --> 01:13:10,999
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't play a whole lot of DDR in the arcade or at home anymore, yet you're very gung-ho about this cabinet and everything.

1239
01:13:11,079 --> 01:13:11,919
[SPEAKER_12]: Why do you think that is?

1240
01:13:11,979 --> 01:13:15,180
[SPEAKER_12]: Is it just a love for the basic concept of the game?

1241
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:17,921
[SPEAKER_12]: I like building stuff, have you noticed?

1242
01:13:18,221 --> 01:13:19,081
[SPEAKER_12]: Stuff that doesn't work.

1243
01:13:20,021 --> 01:13:21,122
[SPEAKER_11]: Like the portal to hell.

1244
01:13:21,342 --> 01:13:22,142
[SPEAKER_11]: The portal to hell.

1245
01:13:23,863 --> 01:13:27,626
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, I noticed you tend to build things halfway through and don't finish them.

1246
01:13:27,966 --> 01:13:35,131
[SPEAKER_12]: Such as these lovely metal pads that have been sitting over here for the past... Can we play Xbox or PS2 games with them right now?

1247
01:13:36,572 --> 01:13:43,197
[SPEAKER_11]: We can if I hooked up the other... the, um... iPad thing, because all I have to do is switch out the old iPad and it plugs right in and it works.

1248
01:13:43,677 --> 01:13:44,318
[SPEAKER_11]: But the thing is...

1249
01:13:45,078 --> 01:13:52,744
[SPEAKER_11]: The thing is, I haven't bought the adapter for the Xbox or the PS2 yet because it was hooking up directly to my computer.

1250
01:13:54,326 --> 01:13:55,186
[SPEAKER_11]: But yes, I could.

1251
01:13:55,407 --> 01:13:56,468
[SPEAKER_11]: I could if I wanted to.

1252
01:13:56,548 --> 01:13:58,809
[SPEAKER_11]: It just would take a while because I'd have to wire everything.

1253
01:14:00,451 --> 01:14:06,256
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's just that those things, I would be curious how thick the layer of dust is on those metal pads that are sitting right there.

1254
01:14:07,316 --> 01:14:10,419
[SPEAKER_12]: Can I go wipe my finger on it and see how much dust is on them?

1255
01:14:12,301 --> 01:14:12,741
[SPEAKER_12]: Here you go, Loki.

1256
01:14:15,410 --> 01:14:17,851
[SPEAKER_11]: They also buy the air intake, just so you know.

1257
01:14:23,853 --> 01:14:25,554
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, okay, I have an idea.

1258
01:14:25,794 --> 01:14:30,856
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me wipe the dust off of my little, my computer desk here, because I get quite a bit used to it.

1259
01:14:30,996 --> 01:14:31,717
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, like it's gray.

1260
01:14:31,997 --> 01:14:35,238
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me wipe the dust off of every, there's dust everywhere in here.

1261
01:14:35,678 --> 01:14:37,899
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not a surprise that there's dust on those.

1262
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:45,182
[SPEAKER_11]: That and they're right next to the air intake, which I'm sure is not good for the air conditioner one bit, but that's all right.

1263
01:14:47,130 --> 01:14:49,171
[SPEAKER_12]: No wonder it smells like wood in this house all the time.

1264
01:14:49,211 --> 01:14:51,312
[SPEAKER_12]: This strange mix of metal and everything.

1265
01:14:51,973 --> 01:14:53,754
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, uh, Explicit.

1266
01:14:53,994 --> 01:14:54,954
[SPEAKER_12]: Welcome to the show, by the way.

1267
01:14:55,014 --> 01:14:56,155
[SPEAKER_12]: I noticed you just ran in there.

1268
01:14:56,455 --> 01:14:57,436
[SPEAKER_12]: Put down the DS for a minute.

1269
01:14:57,476 --> 01:14:58,296
[SPEAKER_12]: Quit chatting with Angel on.

1270
01:14:58,316 --> 01:14:59,077
[SPEAKER_12]: Take a chat for a minute.

1271
01:14:59,757 --> 01:15:01,138
[SPEAKER_12]: That mic's been giving us... Yeah.

1272
01:15:01,638 --> 01:15:03,479
[SPEAKER_12]: They are like, what, eight feet?

1273
01:15:04,439 --> 01:15:05,160
[SPEAKER_13]: What the hell?

1274
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:09,302
[SPEAKER_13]: This is what... I think they're exchanging special pictures.

1275
01:15:09,482 --> 01:15:10,583
[SPEAKER_11]: This is wrong, people.

1276
01:15:10,603 --> 01:15:12,724
[SPEAKER_11]: You need to talk.

1277
01:15:13,683 --> 01:15:18,406
[SPEAKER_11]: Talky Talky, just like, you know, the people IMing each other when they're sitting in a cafe.

1278
01:15:18,806 --> 01:15:19,106
[SPEAKER_12]: Talk.

1279
01:15:20,687 --> 01:15:23,229
[SPEAKER_12]: They're riding a penis back and forth to each other.

1280
01:15:23,309 --> 01:15:23,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, okay.

1281
01:15:24,629 --> 01:15:25,890
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Rob, that's you last night.

1282
01:15:25,930 --> 01:15:26,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1283
01:15:26,691 --> 01:15:27,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1284
01:15:27,631 --> 01:15:30,193
[SPEAKER_12]: You gotta hold the mic at the bottom, because it's going out tonight.

1285
01:15:30,373 --> 01:15:31,393
[SPEAKER_12]: That mic's on its last legs.

1286
01:15:31,413 --> 01:15:32,034
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you hear me now?

1287
01:15:32,054 --> 01:15:32,894
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, I can hear you now.

1288
01:15:32,914 --> 01:15:33,595
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you play DDR?

1289
01:15:34,215 --> 01:15:40,619
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, just as an internment and stuff, and if some new people want me to come back again, I guess I'll play again.

1290
01:15:42,456 --> 01:15:49,281
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, even though the DDR scene is dying in a way, because there hasn't been any releases for the arcades and stuff, it's totally understandable.

1291
01:15:50,723 --> 01:15:57,748
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's just the new people, the community, the new members are just trying to bring it back again in a way.

1292
01:15:57,768 --> 01:15:59,769
[SPEAKER_11]: You give me $100,000, I'll bring back DDR.

1293
01:16:00,350 --> 01:16:00,870
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm telling you.

1294
01:16:00,930 --> 01:16:04,433
[SPEAKER_14]: The only way that you can bring back DDR is by fixing the Sanmenia cabinet, dammit.

1295
01:16:04,453 --> 01:16:05,614
[SPEAKER_11]: I like that cabinet.

1296
01:16:05,834 --> 01:16:06,234
[SPEAKER_11]: You give me $100,000...

1297
01:16:07,759 --> 01:16:10,380
[SPEAKER_11]: Hell, give me just $20,000 and I'll bring it back.

1298
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:17,702
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't you think that, now call me crazy because it's not supposed to be DDR, quote unquote, don't you think In The Groove was sort of a way to try to bring DDR back?

1299
01:16:18,283 --> 01:16:21,604
[SPEAKER_12]: That's why I always got the impression that In The Groove was, even though it's not DDR.

1300
01:16:23,844 --> 01:16:27,906
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, the thing about In The Groove is that not many cabinets have been sold around the U.S.

1301
01:16:27,966 --> 01:16:28,386
[SPEAKER_14]: just yet.

1302
01:16:29,511 --> 01:16:34,377
[SPEAKER_14]: And very few songs are in it, mainly just testing the waters until the Groove 2 comes out and stuff.

1303
01:16:35,859 --> 01:16:40,625
[SPEAKER_14]: And it also depends on who, what set makers are they gonna hire and what songs they're gonna put in it.

1304
01:16:43,329 --> 01:16:47,113
[SPEAKER_14]: Hell, if they put Ultra Mix, like Ultra Mix in the DDR Cam and I play it...

1305
01:16:49,354 --> 01:16:52,196
[SPEAKER_12]: The first week after Ultramix 2 is out, I put the call out on this show.

1306
01:16:52,216 --> 01:16:56,098
[SPEAKER_12]: I said, we need to hound the shit out of Konami of Hawaii and however it has to happen.

1307
01:16:56,218 --> 01:17:00,340
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't care if some arcade division went under or what the shit happened.

1308
01:17:00,680 --> 01:17:02,041
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't care how it has to happen.

1309
01:17:02,181 --> 01:17:03,101
[SPEAKER_12]: It just needs to happen.

1310
01:17:03,361 --> 01:17:04,782
[SPEAKER_12]: Hawaii needs to make a new arcade mix.

1311
01:17:05,182 --> 01:17:05,743
[SPEAKER_12]: End of story.

1312
01:17:06,123 --> 01:17:08,764
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't care who's got to be blown, who's got to be paid the money.

1313
01:17:09,284 --> 01:17:10,085
[SPEAKER_12]: Make it happen.

1314
01:17:10,685 --> 01:17:12,326
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what's hella funny, though?

1315
01:17:12,926 --> 01:17:16,168
[SPEAKER_14]: That hella companies are saying that the whole arcade business is dying.

1316
01:17:16,584 --> 01:17:17,045
[SPEAKER_14]: I have no cards.

1317
01:17:36,704 --> 01:17:41,368
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, that's just like people saying, oh, well, you know, internet's killing the telephones.

1318
01:17:42,509 --> 01:17:45,011
[SPEAKER_11]: People still use the telephones, just like people use the internet.

1319
01:17:45,331 --> 01:17:48,113
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, people still use the telephone, and I talk to them.

1320
01:17:48,373 --> 01:17:48,673
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

1321
01:17:49,034 --> 01:17:55,479
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, but the whole thing is, is the convert, you know, Ultramix to an arcade system is like fucking easy.

1322
01:17:55,939 --> 01:17:58,101
[SPEAKER_11]: Minimal programming, licensing of songs.

1323
01:17:59,142 --> 01:17:59,862
[SPEAKER_11]: Build the hardware.

1324
01:18:00,022 --> 01:18:01,363
[SPEAKER_11]: Hardware's fucking easy to build.

1325
01:18:01,403 --> 01:18:02,864
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, come on.

1326
01:18:02,925 --> 01:18:05,607
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just an excuse, but I just don't want to do it.

1327
01:18:06,167 --> 01:18:07,793
[SPEAKER_11]: Because they don't want to distribute it, and that's a bitch.

1328
01:18:07,993 --> 01:18:12,367
[SPEAKER_14]: The reason why I pump it up is by making more and more money just building new machines and stuff.

1329
01:18:14,651 --> 01:18:22,355
[SPEAKER_12]: Allow me to be the first to offer sex to anyone at Konami of Hawaii if you can make yourselves a new DDR game.

1330
01:18:22,775 --> 01:18:23,676
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what?

1331
01:18:23,916 --> 01:18:26,377
[SPEAKER_12]: Not that Konami of Japan does a bad job.

1332
01:18:26,437 --> 01:18:29,559
[SPEAKER_12]: So if they want to do a new mix, I'm perfectly fine with that as well.

1333
01:18:30,019 --> 01:18:35,082
[SPEAKER_12]: I will extend my sex offer to Konami of Tokyo as well, K-Set.

1334
01:18:35,622 --> 01:18:38,043
[SPEAKER_12]: So just make me a new DDR and I will put out.

1335
01:18:38,143 --> 01:18:38,764
[SPEAKER_12]: It's that simple.

1336
01:18:39,524 --> 01:18:42,926
[SPEAKER_12]: Anybody else care to offer their sexual favors?

1337
01:18:45,354 --> 01:18:48,156
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, this is what's pissing me off.

1338
01:18:48,176 --> 01:18:52,139
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, oh, this is too expensive to license songs here in America.

1339
01:18:52,379 --> 01:18:53,580
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why we can't do it.

1340
01:18:53,861 --> 01:18:54,841
[SPEAKER_11]: Do all in-house music.

1341
01:18:54,861 --> 01:18:58,884
[SPEAKER_11]: You have, like, what, five different series to pull from?

1342
01:18:58,944 --> 01:19:00,365
[SPEAKER_12]: Do what you've been doing for years.

1343
01:19:00,526 --> 01:19:03,408
[SPEAKER_12]: License the song in Japan and then let the machines come over here.

1344
01:19:03,868 --> 01:19:05,209
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what they've been doing for years.

1345
01:19:06,530 --> 01:19:09,152
[SPEAKER_12]: Because it's cheaper to license the songs in Japan, obviously.

1346
01:19:09,693 --> 01:19:26,509
[SPEAKER_11]: I look a little weird, but like, I made this machine over here in Japan, it's called a DDR Stream USA, but it's not meant to be played in the United States, just... They could call it DDR Shit Mix, and I'd still play it.

1347
01:19:27,190 --> 01:19:28,151
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry, Shitake.

1348
01:19:29,032 --> 01:19:32,175
[SPEAKER_12]: They could call it DDR Shitake Mix, I would still play it.

1349
01:19:32,195 --> 01:19:33,016
[SPEAKER_14]: Shitake, that's all.

1350
01:19:36,274 --> 01:19:39,121
[SPEAKER_12]: Angel, you still play DDR at all?

1351
01:19:39,522 --> 01:19:42,650
[SPEAKER_12]: You're probably more into DDR than anyone I know right now, so I have to ask you this.

1352
01:19:43,783 --> 01:19:51,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, in fact, I'm probably going to break down and get a dual platform Ignition because I want to play on Xbox Live.

1353
01:19:51,706 --> 01:19:59,770
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, I'm looking into getting both of those this week, Ultramix 2 and the new pad.

1354
01:20:00,470 --> 01:20:04,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Magus isn't dying anyway, so might as well just replace it.

1355
01:20:04,092 --> 01:20:06,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we can play doubles and stuff.

1356
01:20:06,472 --> 01:20:07,113
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.

1357
01:20:07,133 --> 01:20:09,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of doubles, which is better, Ignition or Carameldansen?

1358
01:20:11,465 --> 01:20:13,446
[SPEAKER_12]: I couldn't tell you because I haven't really played enough Cobalt Flux.

1359
01:20:13,486 --> 01:20:16,727
[SPEAKER_12]: I saw it a little bit at E3, but it wasn't familiar enough with it.

1360
01:20:17,207 --> 01:20:18,827
[SPEAKER_11]: They're both the same fucking pad!

1361
01:20:19,168 --> 01:20:21,088
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the same damn thing with a different logo on it.

1362
01:20:21,128 --> 01:20:21,728
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all it is.

1363
01:20:22,088 --> 01:20:23,129
[SPEAKER_11]: You can't get much different.

1364
01:20:23,429 --> 01:20:25,430
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, our metal is different than your metal!

1365
01:20:26,230 --> 01:20:27,210
[SPEAKER_11]: What about the quality?

1366
01:20:27,670 --> 01:20:30,351
[SPEAKER_14]: What about the quality and how many times could it be stepped?

1367
01:20:30,711 --> 01:20:31,592
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't matter.

1368
01:20:31,612 --> 01:20:32,732
[SPEAKER_11]: They're the fucking same.

1369
01:20:33,598 --> 01:20:36,819
[SPEAKER_14]: The gold flood said not even a rhino could beat down the pad.

1370
01:20:37,079 --> 01:20:37,379
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah!

1371
01:20:37,859 --> 01:20:39,419
[SPEAKER_11]: Do they have a rhino to test this?

1372
01:20:39,620 --> 01:20:43,100
[SPEAKER_11]: Did they take it to Africa and go, hey rhino, step on the pad!

1373
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:44,121
[SPEAKER_11]: How do you like it?

1374
01:20:44,581 --> 01:20:45,381
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I'm sorry.

1375
01:20:45,621 --> 01:20:46,861
[SPEAKER_11]: So I can say, yeah, guess what?

1376
01:20:47,041 --> 01:20:48,962
[SPEAKER_11]: Jupiter has nothing on this pad.

1377
01:20:49,542 --> 01:20:51,182
[SPEAKER_11]: This pad can fuck up Jupiter.

1378
01:20:52,543 --> 01:20:55,243
[SPEAKER_11]: Seriously, they're just pulling shit out of their ass, okay?

1379
01:20:55,323 --> 01:20:56,884
[SPEAKER_11]: A rhino can't fuck this up.

1380
01:20:57,064 --> 01:20:57,704
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, well, guess what?

1381
01:20:57,744 --> 01:21:01,145
[SPEAKER_11]: Bigfoot recommends, you know, red octane, so fuck that.

1382
01:21:02,814 --> 01:21:03,374
[SPEAKER_07]: It's stupid.

1383
01:21:03,575 --> 01:21:07,398
[SPEAKER_11]: Really, to be honest, when it comes down to pads, don't buy off the internet.

1384
01:21:07,998 --> 01:21:09,339
[SPEAKER_11]: Buy stuff that you can see at a store.

1385
01:21:09,379 --> 01:21:11,861
[SPEAKER_11]: Buy it like fries and stuff where you can actually see these pads.

1386
01:21:11,881 --> 01:21:19,788
[SPEAKER_11]: Because the shit you get off the internet, because I have bought metal pads off the internet, and I stepped on them and they bent.

1387
01:21:20,528 --> 01:21:21,569
[SPEAKER_11]: They bent downwards.

1388
01:21:22,050 --> 01:21:23,291
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was like, what the fuck?

1389
01:21:24,372 --> 01:21:25,112
[SPEAKER_11]: It was retarded.

1390
01:21:25,813 --> 01:21:28,435
[SPEAKER_11]: Pads are not meant to be folded in half.

1391
01:21:29,195 --> 01:21:33,817
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow, talk about how they say SEVs can't bust them on their advertisements.

1392
01:21:34,097 --> 01:21:37,159
[SPEAKER_12]: Our chatroom over at www.orangeloungeradio.com, clicking on chat.

1393
01:21:37,439 --> 01:21:43,641
[SPEAKER_12]: Interesting point, there already is a DDR shit mix, and it's the Don't Fall Off mix, the DDR Extreme bootleg.

1394
01:21:44,062 --> 01:21:45,142
[SPEAKER_12]: You know the one that would speed up?

1395
01:21:45,322 --> 01:21:46,103
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I see there's two of them.

1396
01:21:46,123 --> 01:21:48,043
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I know about the speed up.

1397
01:21:48,184 --> 01:21:49,524
[SPEAKER_12]: DDR Extreme Plus, thank you.

1398
01:21:49,644 --> 01:21:52,365
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, the one in Country Club Lane, speed up.

1399
01:21:52,565 --> 01:21:55,167
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, let's speed up Max 300 and see if we can beat it at 360 BPM.

1400
01:21:55,227 --> 01:21:55,847
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, wow.

1401
01:21:59,373 --> 01:22:02,136
[SPEAKER_14]: or hear cartoon heroes in a very high-pitched voice.

1402
01:22:16,793 --> 01:22:18,494
[SPEAKER_12]: What is the deal with Cartoon Heroes?

1403
01:22:18,895 --> 01:22:25,879
[SPEAKER_12]: Why do so many people freaking love that song and are quick to label a mix as utter shit if that song isn't in it?

1404
01:22:26,359 --> 01:22:27,980
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't understand what is so great about the song.

1405
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:28,741
[SPEAKER_12]: Is it a good song?

1406
01:22:29,021 --> 01:22:29,901
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's a great song.

1407
01:22:29,941 --> 01:22:31,102
[SPEAKER_12]: It was a little better when Aqua did it.

1408
01:22:31,362 --> 01:22:32,203
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's a good song.

1409
01:22:32,723 --> 01:22:33,544
[SPEAKER_12]: Is it fun to play?

1410
01:22:34,184 --> 01:22:36,687
[SPEAKER_12]: Kinda, I mean, I'll die when I play it.

1411
01:22:36,767 --> 01:22:40,570
[SPEAKER_12]: But why do so many people freaking obsess over Cartoon Heroes?

1412
01:22:40,810 --> 01:22:44,633
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, do you know how many people threw a fit when that song was in Extreme USA?

1413
01:22:46,234 --> 01:22:53,701
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's look back in DDR history and view what we call the songs that ruin mixes.

1414
01:22:54,261 --> 01:22:55,122
[SPEAKER_11]: Starting with...

1415
01:22:55,782 --> 01:22:57,443
[SPEAKER_11]: Third mix, Afronova.

1416
01:22:57,964 --> 01:23:03,067
[SPEAKER_11]: Who could love this wonderful African shent as you jump around like a complete nut?

1417
01:23:03,848 --> 01:23:09,311
[SPEAKER_11]: Fourth mix, Kick the Can, with its repetitive steps over and over and over again.

1418
01:23:10,092 --> 01:23:11,553
[SPEAKER_05]: There's another contributing factor.

1419
01:23:12,654 --> 01:23:11,553
1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 0, 7.

1420
01:23:17,117 --> 01:23:20,919
[SPEAKER_12]: You're forgetting, though, my edit to Kick the Can, a.k.a.

1421
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:24,362
[SPEAKER_12]: Big Cans, was awesome and made that song redeemable.

1422
01:23:26,092 --> 01:23:29,313
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, as I would continue on, the fifth mix, Hot Limits.

1423
01:23:29,813 --> 01:23:33,575
[SPEAKER_11]: The song that's just, you don't understand what they're saying, but you know it's very long.

1424
01:23:36,696 --> 01:23:43,018
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways, DDR Max, I'd say probably that would be Exotic Ethnic.

1425
01:23:43,238 --> 01:23:45,238
[SPEAKER_11]: It was pretty repetitive in DDR Max.

1426
01:23:45,579 --> 01:23:46,659
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh no, Flash in the Night.

1427
01:23:46,859 --> 01:23:48,299
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that was another one.

1428
01:23:48,380 --> 01:23:52,041
[SPEAKER_07]: Flash in the Night.

1429
01:23:52,161 --> 01:23:53,561
[SPEAKER_12]: Hold on, your mic's still cutting out a little bit.

1430
01:23:53,621 --> 01:23:54,322
[SPEAKER_12]: Hold it at the bottom.

1431
01:23:54,462 --> 01:23:55,222
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to bring out the...

1432
01:23:57,405 --> 01:23:57,786
[SPEAKER_12]: A little bit.

1433
01:23:57,826 --> 01:23:58,366
[SPEAKER_12]: Hold it at the bottom.

1434
01:23:59,447 --> 01:24:00,187
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, try it, try it.

1435
01:24:00,428 --> 01:24:01,388
[SPEAKER_12]: Put it close to the bottom.

1436
01:24:01,529 --> 01:24:02,229
[SPEAKER_14]: There you go.

1437
01:24:02,369 --> 01:24:07,694
[SPEAKER_14]: The same reason why Cartoon Heroes got poured out is the same reason why So Deep is getting poured off with DDR Max.

1438
01:24:07,914 --> 01:24:09,315
[SPEAKER_14]: Because it's like hard as hell 9.

1439
01:24:10,096 --> 01:24:15,920
[SPEAKER_12]: I would say the song that ruined DDR Max, even though I love this song, Cowgirl.

1440
01:24:16,881 --> 01:24:17,562
[SPEAKER_12]: Cowgirl, yes.

1441
01:24:18,442 --> 01:24:23,947
