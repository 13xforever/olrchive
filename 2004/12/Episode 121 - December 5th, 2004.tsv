206962	207622	That is crazy.
208182	211024	Because we just had an 80s pre-show and it kind of ties into that.
211064	212265	That little thing you're playing right there.
213967	216689	Yeah, we got a whole lot of interesting stuff to talk about tonight.
216789	217549	Actually, I'm lying.
217749	221351	There's really not a whole lot going on, but we're going to try to film three hours best we can anyway.
223212	227794	I know I want to talk about 8th Style tonight, Pop Music 10, because I got to play both those this week for the first time.
228214	233797	Of course, How's Your Week, How's Your Day, Cage Match, all that fun stuff when we come back after this break featuring...
234637	237938	Music from DDR Third Mix, because Third Mix was cool.

518544	527891	And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.
528650	532732	Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bomani Music and More program.
532772	533732	Can we talk about that?
534012	536373	No subject will ever be taboo.
536633	540274	Well, I was thinking maybe we should move Pump Up the Volume from Tuesday Nights.
540794	543335	Except, of course, a subject that was just under discussion.
543855	549197	Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?
549738	551018	I collect your fucking head.
553001	554502	Just like this fucker here.
556664	559265	Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki?
559546	562948	The hot thing on episode 69 was just a joke!
563889	570373	Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!
571534	575337	Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.
578299	581381	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
582529	584930	The lovely and wonderful Jamie there in that promo.
585110	586031	Well, sort of.
586051	588592	I was played by Lucy Liu.
589332	590013	You remember that?
590073	590953	A long time ago.
591293	594034	This was probably the first year of Orange Lounge Radio.
594815	597876	It's sad that that could be considered retro, but it really is.
598136	603939	You remember way back during the first year of this program when somebody had talked about... I want to say it was Dark Tetsuya was somehow involved with this.
604299	607321	Brought up the casting of the Orange Lounge movie.
608413	612236	And they took votes in the chat room and they said that you should be played by Lucy Liu.
612957	613778	How ironic.
613898	615179	Which is, yeah, how ironic.
615359	616660	A little too ironic.
616961	619002	Especially considering you're not Asian at all.
619643	621825	No, but, you know what?
622826	624687	I finally got something new when I went to Alabama.
625248	627650	That would be like me being played by Denzel Washington.
627670	630432	That's funny.
630512	631033	Anyway, sorry.
631373	631994	Yes, Alabama.
632094	635076	I got, I believe it was, I thought you were taller.
636485	638166	All right, this is a good segue.
638186	642628	We've got to get into how was your week, how was your day, because I've got to figure out about what this is all about.
642688	643809	So, Jamie, how was your week, how was your day?
644669	647250	My couple of weeks were pretty decent.
647591	650012	Very, very, very, very, very, very busy.
651553	651953	Let's see.
652453	654814	With my trip to Alabama, I got there.
655134	658056	My mom got us lost on the way from New Orleans.
658496	660497	We ended up heading up toward Hattiesburg.
662238	663699	There's something stuck in this thing.
663719	665500	Anyway, we ended up going up to Hattiesburg.
666638	669981	And then right when mom realized where we were, we had to go around a different way, so we headed home.
672003	674165	Got there, I didn't get in bed until 6 in the morning central.
675166	680712	That means I had been up an official 24 hours because I woke up at 4 Pacific in the morning.
680732	681332	Congratulations.
682814	683494	My house crashed.
684635	688079	Next day was Thanksgiving, but we didn't do Thanksgiving stuff, we just slept.
689800	689921	And...
691670	693591	Did some hanging out, you know, it was pretty cool.
695992	700834	Then on Friday I went to Dothan, saw my daddy, my Uncle Dale.
701374	703595	My Uncle Dale and my daddy are having their second childhoods.
704315	706396	My Uncle Dale has a... A.K.A.
706456	707897	midlife crisis.
708137	708897	2004 Mustang GT.
709717	710818	My daddy has a Camaro.
713351	718294	Yeah, my daddy is cute on the internet because they have this old 500 megahertz kind of crappy thing.
719695	725959	And my daddy is so cute playing on it because he just hunts and pecks for the little keys and it's so cute.
726399	731042	And my daddy sends me everything in 72-point font and email.
732783	733343	It's adorable.
733464	735245	I used to be that way on AOL Instant Messenger.
735285	738527	I would type to everybody in huge 72-point font and they'd be like, knock it off!
740663	744845	but I figured my chats are very important and I want to make sure they're not missed.
746866	754811	Well, so Saturday we had our official Thanksgiving at my uncle's house and we had fried turkey
756556	758217	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
786286	787907	But I had a really good time.
787927	798975	And then that night I went to Ground Zero, which is a sort of a... Okay, it's like a comic book store with gaming tables.
799355	800736	There were lots of people playing Yu-Gi-Oh!
800756	801897	and I felt really nerdy.
802557	805939	And then, but downstairs there's like an arcade there.
805959	806520	It was pretty cool.
806540	810782	That's a very strange name for an arcade in light of recent events.
811663	812283	Isn't it great?
813264	813624	Okay.
814745	828334	But there was a DDR Extreme, there was a 4th Solo, there was a... 4th Solo, that's hot.
828354	829595	There was a Virtual On.
830396	832097	I played the hell out of Virtual On.
832557	833578	And a Super Pac-Man.
834599	837080	Oh my god, so one of my favorite... And I had a Dance Maniacs.
837721	838441	Oh, cool.
839322	841463	And a Beatmania 6 mix.
842668	843508	And Keyboard Mania 3rd
864324	865705	I met quite a few people.
865785	870368	Actually, I met the... I'm supposing that he's in charge of the machines there.
870548	872689	He goes by Pyramus Online.
873550	874691	Very, very cool guy.
874791	876772	I went to a... I went to a Bomani party!
877192	877412	What?
877893	879273	You went to a Bomani party?
879453	879954	Yeah.
880454	882595	You just randomly got invited to a Bomani party down there?
882615	887839	They were all heading over, so I went over and played Ace Style on a widescreen TV, and that was rad.
887959	888639	Very nice.
888679	889520	So, you just...
890100	892383	You went over to strangers' houses to play video games?
892403	896509	He actually lived about a block away from where my extra mates lived.
897550	898552	So it was very close.
899373	904640	And I went over, of course, to hang out with my mama's son and my papa's son.
905661	909625	and Kay Kitty and Bobby and we had a pretty good time.
909945	910826	We watched movies.
911326	916511	I saw The End of the Day After Tomorrow and no offense but that movie sucks.
917712	921755	I don't think... That's my very professional opinion.
921775	923437	I don't know a lot of people are going to disagree with you there.
923477	924358	My mom loves the movie.
924578	925238	They love the movie.
925639	928661	I don't really want to put down anyone else's opinion of it but my opinion of it is crap.
929702	929782	Um...
931904	941150	We also, I learned the fine art of DVD duplication, and so I was able to deliver a copy of Kill Bill Volume 2.
941531	943072	Orange Linger does not advocate piracy.
943132	945453	Yes, he did.
946474	960183	And I got, actually, you know, there's that show, Kindred the Embraced, that came on, based off of the White Wolf Universe, and I have all the episodes they ever made of that, because I think that the actor died, the main guy, who's playing the prince.
962025	968494	But, um, I have all of that, I still have it on my, uh If anyone brings me DVDs, you'll get copies Um
969406	971087	Orange Sounds Radio does not advocate piracy.
971607	974168	It's actually, no, they're not... I'm just teasing.
974968	975949	They're not licensed right now.
975969	980311	Well, I want to find out more about this Bramante party because basically you went over to a stranger's house.
981191	982232	I sang, Rob.
982292	985173	People that stalk us on the internet, right?
985753	987714	You got invited... A few people are our listeners.
987754	990976	Yes, okay, so message to our listeners, stalking us works.
991716	996238	And... I just hung out with a lot of... A lot of the people, though, were people from DDR Freak.
996558	997238	Well, no, that's cool.
997458	998099	But, yeah, I mean, you got...
999096	1004238	You've got the moderatorship on DDR Freak, so a lot of people know who you are over there.
1004538	1010781	The show's getting pretty big over there, thanks to the syndication on Friday nights over there on Freak Radio.
1011121	1012542	It was just a bunch of people.
1012562	1013722	I met a lot of good people.
1015743	1018404	We basically were just playing 8th style.
1018424	1021326	We brought out Karaoke Revolution.
1022935	1024436	Now, you don't sing karaoke.
1024576	1027898	I don't, but I got the line from Adventures in Babysitting.
1028798	1030819	Nobody leaves without singing the blues.
1032300	1034101	And that's all it took?
1034141	1036122	They didn't have to feed you Guinness or anything?
1036222	1037522	I was begged.
1037783	1039503	They didn't make you drink Guinness or anything?
1039704	1040964	You just did it perfectly sober?
1040984	1044086	I just figured it was going to be about another year before I'm back.
1044886	1049028	And you knew that there were no recording devices present, so... So I sang Bizarre Love Triangle.
1049128	1049909	Oh, no, that's a good song.
1050289	1050489	Yeah.
1050888	1053471	Now, see, you missed some karaoke action here on the show last week.
1053952	1054673	No, I didn't miss it.
1054693	1055093	I'm sorry.
1057136	1057396	Thing.
1057636	1057917	All right.
1060900	1065266	No, I actually, I was really... Loki's still pissed at me over it, by the way.
1066514	1095019	I actually was going to be trying to tune in on my laptop, but I had promised my mama-son I was going to take her to see The Grudge, which after having, since I was glad I saw Ju-on first, very glad I saw it first, because then, it was neat noting the differences in the movie, I'm not going to spoil it for anyone who hasn't, and actually, the thing that pissed me off is that I don't know the reason why they think they have to explain every single last fucking detail to a U.S.
1095099	1095459	audience,
1096201	1096341	What?
1115060	1115560	Steak and Shake.
1115720	1118661	Only in the South, which you have a place called Steak and Shake.
1118961	1120902	It's these thick hamburgers, really good.
1121202	1122742	It's like a little diner type place.
1123142	1125703	But you can get these humongous milkshakes and they make a half and half.
1126563	1127844	It's literally split down the middle.
1127904	1130305	Half one side is one flavor, half the other is the other.
1130645	1132625	So I actually mixed it up and had banana eggnog.
1134406	1134746	Huh.
1135586	1136366	Oh God, it was good.
1136907	1138247	That was orgasm in the glass.
1140905	1144048	Anyway... No, it didn't taste like tuna.
1144589	1145870	It tasted like banana and eggnog.
1146671	1146991	Damn it.
1147992	1148733	Anyway, um...
1150342	1152563	I got to meet lots of good people.
1152583	1153904	I had a really good time.
1156205	1160027	Monday, my brother was being an ass the whole time.
1160408	1164430	I'm not too proud of my brother Matthew.
1165711	1167291	I talked to my brother Phillip while I was there.
1167972	1171294	He's supposed to be down for Christmas, I think.
1175573	1177537	and he's getting married.
1178318	1179239	Well, he's already married.
1179881	1188395	This is my brother who's a Marine and his wife's a Marine and they're actually going to Texas to have a humongous big Mexican wedding.
1189844	1190464	I'm going to go.
1190484	1191345	Awesome.
1191365	1192605	Because this is going to be a big party.
1193685	1195146	Will there be margaritas involved?
1195866	1196166	Likely.
1196386	1198687	Awesome.
1198787	1201828	Actually, people that know me pretty well know that I'm actually not a big tequila fan.
1202088	1206150	I'll drink margaritas because you can barely taste the tequila, but I cannot stand straight up tequila.
1206790	1209851	You know, you had that cheap shit here.
1211165	1212186	But I still don't like tequila.
1212206	1213106	You can give me Cuervo.
1213166	1213506	I don't care.
1213526	1214066	I still don't like it.
1214106	1215567	I can do shots of tequila.
1215687	1216807	I think it's nasty.
1217408	1219849	I like the Blue Agave tequila.
1220549	1224811	The stuff that Anita had way back at the Nasty House.
1229192	1230973	But it was pretty good.
1231853	1235035	I went back to New Orleans on Tuesday.
1235855	1236875	Hung out with my mommy.
1237015	1237876	I fussed at my mom.
1237916	1238296	It was fun.
1240097	1269465	and then Jamie Fuss had the most long boring flight back and like the last leg of my I hung out at the Dallas airport for nearly two hours airports aren't so bad now though they have wifi there yeah they got wifi I was just chilling on my laptop and not just that but you know just everything there is to do they're practically shopping malls as well although I would never buy anything there but it's fun to look you know airports aren't that bad anymore well some of them are yeah
1269787	1271928	But I was having a pretty good time, I mean.
1272208	1273088	And then I got on a plane.
1273408	1276590	I read the entirety of Ramsey's The Damned on the plane.
1277230	1283132	It's just, I have to say, safely the best Anne Rice book, because all the rest of her stuff since, it's kind of crap.
1283172	1283852	It's been gay porn.
1284973	1286653	Yeah, but it's also been crappy.
1288014	1288914	Really crappy.
1289995	1291515	Woman needs to get her groove back.
1292876	1293736	Not rest on her name.
1295720	1296020	DarkSakura.com
1309557	1311878	You talking about that Babani party makes me nostalgic.
1311898	1313279	Remember when we used to do that stuff?
1314459	1317140	At the old studio, which was a really great house for having parties.
1317200	1318321	We'd have the Babani parties.
1318581	1319762	We need to do that shit again.
1319942	1320462	Yeah, we do.
1321182	1323563	Actually, we kind of had a Babani party last night.
1323663	1328446	I mean, it wasn't like a hardcore Babani party, but I'm sure we'll get to that as we go on through How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day.
1328466	1330807	You remember the stuff I would bring with me?
1330987	1331327	Oh, yeah.
1331347	1333428	People would say Babani party, and I'm like, oh, shit.
1334520	1338463	You bring, like, your old... I remember you brought your Dreamcast pads to one party.
1338743	1339223	Yes, I did.
1339264	1339944	That was insane.
1340825	1346909	I said, okay, this is what DDR was like in the old days, before we had this vivid nonsense.
1347650	1356336	I remember when one of our old guests used to be on the show a bit, Zombie Magus, when he put on his girlfriend's top and was playing Power, Power, Paradise.
1356656	1356916	Yeah.
1356976	1359558	And the picture made some rounds on the internet after that.
1360138	1360679	And, uh...
1361721	1367506	I remember Loki would haul his computer and his Delight Delight reduplication and his pads he'd made for it.
1369287	1369928	I'm nostalgic.
1370208	1374672	I would carry around the Drum Mania, Keyboard Mania, 2DX Controller, the bunch of games.
1375212	1377334	All the old Beat Manias, my ASCII pad.
1379332	1390676	Do you think that when this DDR thing is dead, which could happen any day now, do you think these Bomani parties are still going to be going on?
1390776	1391977	No, we'll just go back to porn.
1392017	1396618	We'll just have to go back to the orgies, you're right.
1397099	1398159	How silly of me to ask.
1401141	1404643	You know, we'd have to get that copy of Ally McFeel again.
1405884	1406584	That was funny.
1406764	1409045	Anyway, anything else you want to share about your week and your day?
1409065	1410766	Uh, no.
1410987	1411727	Moving right along.
1411847	1412147	Alright.
1414929	1418671	Hey, it had a cameo by Ron Jeremy.
1422052	1436676	Oh my god, I was looking up, there's a site online that's like these paper dolls online, and I was trying to make a new avatar for myself on my live journal, and I accidentally came across the real doll site.
1438236	1438837	Oh god.
1439317	1440697	It's very, very icky.
1441637	1445778	I have a request for a new DDR Freak avatar, because the gay pimp one you made me is really cool.
1445798	1447079	I have a request for a new one.
1447199	1451620	I want Xander from Drawn Together, just to make Seeger jealous.
1452216	1452676	From what?
1452876	1454397	Drawn Together, that show on Comedy Central.
1454717	1455157	From what?
1455257	1456658	Oh, girl, you are so far behind.
1457058	1461260	I do not have anything but basic channels, but local channels.
1461280	1461820	You're missing out.
1461860	1462621	It's a funny show.
1462961	1464161	I hardly ever watch TV.
1464241	1465742	And I think the TV is retarded.
1465822	1468803	I don't even watch Survivor or The Apprentice or any of that reality bullshit anymore.
1469364	1470624	Drawn Together is the only show I watch.
1471124	1472265	And when did Hell Freeze Over?
1472845	1473625	I know, I know.
1475026	1476367	You want to talk about Hell Freezing Over?
1476407	1479848	I came this close to joining a gym on Friday.
1481049	1481549	For, um...
1484417	1490863	For the people who didn't have that visual, Rob held his fingers the length of, um, never mind.
1490883	1492864	Because we're not going to talk about that.
1494105	1494385	Shut up.
1495386	1497088	No, because we don't bring up old drama.
1498969	1499250	Yeah.
1501091	1501452	What?
1503293	1503974	Oh, yeah.
1506711	1509034	It says that when you said Xander, I started thinking of Buffy.
1509194	1514981	I need to respond to some stuff in the chatroom going on right now.
1515061	1519946	First off, Sigurd's telling me he hates me because of the Xander thing, and he says his is better.
1519966	1520306	Whatever.
1521167	1523550	And somebody else, where was it?
1523971	1526133	A couple people commented, DDR's not gonna die.
1527494	1527755	Well...
1529816	1531177	I'm only being half serious.
1531217	1537940	I don't think the death of DDR is anytime soon, especially when we just got Ultramix 2 and the home versions are looking very promising for the future.
1538520	1543803	I don't think DDR is seriously going to die, but I think it's a little more cultish, maybe.
1543903	1544203	I don't know.
1544223	1544543	We'll see.
1544743	1545863	I also have an announcement.
1546084	1546324	Yes.
1547564	1549645	I no longer am on the Atkins crap.
1550106	1550766	Well, not crap.
1550966	1551886	It's good for a lot of people.
1552327	1553207	It was not good for me.
1554227	1555708	So I can have sushi again.
1556449	1557169	Congratulations.
1557998	1559079	Sushi is wonderful.
1561340	1563522	And, and, and, and, and, and, and.
1564743	1565243	Nothing else.
1565664	1565944	Okay.
1566904	1567205	Oh, Rob.
1567425	1568165	Yes, yes.
1568245	1571908	Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.
1572589	1572829	Hi.
1574090	1574610	I'm back!
1576611	1576992	Damn.
1577292	1578493	Angel, how was your week?
1578533	1579193	How was your day?
1579213	1581935	Angel, how was your week?
1582556	1583196	How was your day?
1584257	1586679	School was... School and...
1589256	1589816	Oh, nothing.
1589856	1590677	Saturday was nice.
1592318	1600061	I just wanted to waste the week away until Saturday came, because, uh, well, I had a birthday.
1600181	1600882	Come on, everybody.
1601042	1601842	Yay.
1603143	1603523	Yay.
1603963	1604343	Yay.
1605484	1605744	Not.
1607365	1609086	Actually hanging out with everyone was great.
1609726	1617630	Um, and we had played lots of Bomani, uh, 8th style,
1618622	1619903	and Poppin10.
1620703	1622924	So I got to see those for the first time, that was pretty cool.
1624464	1632407	And the best thing of all was obviously hanging around with the people that I don't usually get to hang around with, so that was good.
1634267	1636908	And just enjoying my birthday weekend so far, I guess.
1641010	1643831	And now, Bradley, how was your week, how was your day?
1645771	1647752	Alright, uh, this week was
1649216	1649837	Work, of course.
1651058	1652659	And an interesting thing happened at work.
1652719	1656942	There was a person, my kind of work is, it's sort of a training.
1657263	1659064	They train people to do stuff, so.
1659084	1666250	One of the students came back, so he had some questions for, because he was going to do a test, a state test for his line of work he wanted to get into.
1667150	1678119	And he came back, asked some questions, and he and the instructor had a nice, somehow a disagreement, or something about the instructor doesn't like this guy, so
1678717	1682098	He actually misspoken said that he didn't like him.
1682538	1687079	So this causes him to get really angry and start ranting and raving.
1687139	1689059	And then he had to go outside.
1689159	1692960	The manager had to take him outside and talk for like an hour to try to calm him down.
1692980	1694080	And he came back on Friday.
1694961	1700722	And his wife told him to bring along some candy just to give to us or something like that.
1701662	1705383	And he comes back and... Okay, so here's this candy.
1705543	1706143	And then he comes...
1706607	1709608	And then he starts launching this big thing about discrimination.
1709928	1710948	He discriminates against me.
1711248	1712189	He doesn't like me.
1713009	1715310	For some reason, some bullshit like that.
1715330	1722112	And so, just me and the receptionist are in the room and he's like, blah, blah, blah.
1722772	1724512	Some kind of weird shit like that.
1725393	1732875	So, good thing the boss came in like a minute later and then started to talk to him so we could sneak out.
1733752	1734993	Were they getting paid for this?
1735013	1735173	To talk?
1757817	1761259	Well, it's a business, so it's part of the work.
1761279	1768204	I always found that humorous when, you know, there's big fights going on and we have to sit down and have a discussion, but we're all getting paid for it type thing.
1768564	1771245	We just wasted three hours of productivity to talk out.
1771706	1774928	Not that I ever get into disagreements with people, but, you know, I've had to sit in on them.
1774948	1775768	Well, I didn't have anything to do with it.
1775808	1778150	I just went and sat in the hall because I didn't want to get involved.
1778450	1779350	And you got paid for it, too.
1779711	1783953	Yeah, so it was a nice one hour, like an hour break just to not do anything.
1784414	1786655	Just wait until it cooled down.
1787781	1791643	Oh, okay, and on Monday I got Katamari Damashii, and that was a lot of fun.
1794665	1804610	Sorry, every time somebody... It's like how when everybody says friends, you think of NBC, or when somebody says 90210, with Katamari it's... Shut up, Loki.
1805030	1806391	No, actually, I think of that.
1806411	1807551	I think of that song, too.
1817239	1819280	and played that most every day this week.
1819380	1823061	Actually, I did play this every day this week, except for today, because I got up.
1823361	1836105	Because last night was the party for Angel and Anita, or DD Archipelagic, for their birthdays, and that was a lot of fun, because Navi brought over 8-style and poppin' music.
1836145	1838306	God bless the town's poppin' music whore.
1838326	1841727	I got to play on those arcade-style controllers.
1843228	1843708	Yeah, and...
1846517	1847177	and that was fun.
1847237	1857840	Of course I didn't do all that great on 8th style because basically you had it up on a stand and then the TV was down like two or three feet, several feet away.
1858060	1861321	Of course I hadn't played on an arcade style controller in a long time.
1862202	1868264	And of course there was the, I just played the hard news songs like, oh god, what the hell is it called?
1868324	1869244	Nebula Grasper?
1869624	1873285	Nebula Grasper is a fucking impossible game.
1874192	1876874	Well, at least for a first try, it's like, fuck, what the hell?
1877254	1878035	Like, all over the place.
1879476	1893647	And I always love non-Bamani peoples, like the people who don't really play 2DX, DDR and stuff, I always love their reaction to stuff like that, because there were a few people at the party last night who don't really play DDR, 2DX, and they were just kind of watching Navi playing, and just, like, he was just crazy.
1893667	1899391	He was playing, like, Nebio Grasper another or something, and just everybody was just kind of like, that's crazy.
1900872	1901833	That is so crazy.
1905376	1907616	Mr. Loki, how was your week, how was your day?
1934673	1947118	Today did not start out too good due to certain events that have taken place outside of our apartment complex in the street.
1948058	1948739	It was not fun.
1948859	1950159	Well, we'll get into that later, I'm sure.
1950799	1955521	And then yesterday, it was okay.
1956002	1956622	Went and...
1957771	1958732	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1978615	1986098	I don't know, most of the week I've been just playing Final Fantasy XI, leveling my summoner to 20, which I just finished right before the show.
1986918	1990420	And, um... What else have I been doing?
1990480	1997463	I've played a little bit of Grand Theft Auto, finally passed this mission that I couldn't beat for a while, and now I have to run errands for some pimp.
1998443	2003025	And, um... Went and saw Closer, I'll get into that later.
2004166	2007647	And, um... Eh, that's about all.
2008769	2012412	It's been like kind of a week just crashing into the ground.
2013733	2015134	That sucks about your grandma, I'm sorry to hear it.
2016615	2016916	Okay.
2017596	2019498	Have you used your machine to try and contact her yet?
2020899	2022320	No, I have not, you asshole.
2025463	2025803	Anyway.
2025823	2028885	Did you ever open your portal to hell?
2029806	2032929	I was gonna say, you went on a ghostbusting trip yesterday, didn't you?
2033389	2033870	Hunting.
2034110	2035571	Ghost hunting, not busting.
2036337	2065699	We just, we went, walked around Knights Ferry, which is basically this old abandoned, it's not really an abandoned mining town, it's just an old, um, mining town, it's got like a bunch of dilapidated, it's not really a mining town, I guess, they have an old, um, mill there that's kind of been, um, it's just the ruins of it, so we just walked around there, and they also have a very long, um, they have a 150 meter, uh, covered bridge, which is pretty neat, and we walked down that, and we went to their, um,
2066653	2091052	Graveyard that was there and walked around that for a little bit but you know I mean these are just for it's just kind of just to get out of the house because we you know we're looking for like an actual place that my my example was something that's more trauma there than you know old you know because necessarily just visiting any old place is not going to work you need to have something where oh yeah 50 people murdered there you know that kind of thing
2091870	2095771	Um, just something, you know, traumatic, like, uh, Insane Asylum or something like that.
2096151	2099131	But, you know, no luck with any of that stuff around here, so.
2099851	2100072	Oh, well.
2102232	2102592	So, yeah.
2102972	2103792	That's what I've been doing.
2104172	2105632	Isn't this place the Insane Asylum?
2106773	2107313	Not yet.
2107493	2109113	I have to haunt this place first.
2109293	2110873	I haven't quite gotten around to that yet.
2112014	2114914	Soon enough, you know, I've been, like, I have my priorities.
2114934	2117535	Like, I was gonna work on the cabinet today, and then I just got tired.
2118295	2119415	Those fuckers this morning.
2119435	2119515	Yeah.
2121070	2125172	And by tired he means looking for a party in Final Fantasy XI so he can get his summoner to level 20.
2125772	2126072	Addict!
2127013	2130494	No, I was tired from other things, but yes, I just got bored of that too.
2130634	2139718	But the other things in the morning made me tired because I'm exhausted right now from having to wake up early yesterday and having to wake up early today.
2142708	2143949	All right, my turn, my week and my day.
2144249	2148671	I got to play 8th Style and Pop Music 10 twice this week, actually, because I hung out with Navi on Monday.
2148931	2152473	I'll talk about those games a little bit later, because, you know, I want to talk about my money stuff a little bit.
2153193	2160677	But Navi and I, after playing some of that, we got to go to the mall, and I was going to help him do some Christmas shopping over at Arden Fair, which is a big mall in Sacramento.
2160697	2161198	It's a huge mall.
2162438	2164259	And so we ended up walking out of there.
2164299	2165480	He didn't end up buying anything.
2165520	2167161	He just kind of looked around at some different places.
2167641	2170802	And I fucking bought an iPod at the Apple store.
2171823	2173624	Because I wanted one, really.
2174624	2176044	I wanted one really badly.
2176124	2177665	I'm still two away from my free win.
2178265	2180585	Why not just buy a fucking iMac, you know?
2181126	2182186	Just join the cult.
2182366	2183686	I've thought about it, actually.
2184847	2187888	Good, it's a big flaming piece of shit that doesn't do anything.
2188668	2189668	You make Apple users cry.
2189708	2190848	Unless you're into graphics.
2191949	2194589	Or media, which, you know, this show happens to be.
2194629	2196030	Because all the pros are on Macs.
2196270	2198611	Maybe we wouldn't have the freaking buzz on a Mac.
2199431	2199751	Anyway.
2205958	2214220	I just wanted an iPod actually because the stereo in my car broke a while back.
2214360	2220481	Actually, it was Sigurd's Echo Image CD that broke my CD player in the car, actually, because it ate it and wouldn't give it back one day.
2221561	2223942	Once it heard Echo Image, it could hear no other music.
2224902	2227143	Basically is how it all boiled down.
2227163	2227763	So...
2229870	2233793	It won't eject CDs anymore, and now I won't even play the CD that's in there.
2233873	2238276	So, luckily though, it has an auxiliary port in it, so I can plug anything I want in there.
2238296	2241778	So I'm just like, fuck it, I'm gonna get an iPod, and I'll just use that as my car stereo.
2242078	2252725	So it's worked out really well, except for the fact that if you think I'm bad when I'm talking on my cell phone and trying to drive, you should see me when I'm trying to find the song on my iPod I want to hear and drive at the same time.
2254406	2254927	It's beautiful.
2256514	2257095	And you know what?
2257115	2267942	They can pass all the laws they want to say I can't talk on my cell phone and drive, but I don't see them making any law anytime soon that says I can't play on my iPod and try to drive at the same time, so look out.
2268022	2272345	I believe the law is operation of electronical devices while driving, so your iPod's included.
2272385	2273046	God damn it!
2278149	2282433	Extraneous, like CD, well, like laptops.
2283333	2284254	Peripheral devices.
2287177	2297126	Secret in our chatroom right now over at Orangelandradio.com, he says that that day where his Echo Image CD got eaten by my car stereo player, he said that that day kind of pissed him off.
2297486	2302430	Except for the Classic Gaming Expo and the little girl that was hitting all the buttons on the restrooms that she rocked.
2302791	2307735	And that reminds me, I actually found the picture of Jamie doing that at Classic Gaming Expo.
2308055	2309195	I had my heads in the air.
2309415	2310636	What was it?
2310676	2312356	We paid you $10 to do it?
2312476	2312717	Yeah.
2312777	2315137	And I spent it on Pac-Land for the TurboGrafx.
2315157	2318559	Yeah, we bought some game for you, basically, for you to imitate a little girl.
2318619	2319439	I found the picture.
2319459	2320499	I'm going to send it to Sigurd.
2323420	2325621	By the way, we're going to Classic Gaming Expo again this year.
2326488	2328451	It's in Burlingame.
2328471	2334039	The only reason that last year's was in was because they had that thing a few days before.
2334880	2337303	But Classic Gaming Expo this year is going to be in Burlingame.
2337344	2339326	That means trips to network video.
2340989	2342531	And the store that sells the airsoft guns.
2345396	2347560	Alright, and I guess that was pretty much my week and my day.
2347660	2356094	I spent a lot of time playing Final Fantasy XI as well, because basically I got stood up Friday night, so I decided to wither away my sorrows inside a nice game of Final Fantasy XI, so...
2357193	2366276	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2380020	2382941	The freaking game took us three hours to play.
2383341	2385542	The last time I played Cranium it only took two.
2385882	2387703	Turbo Cranium ended up taking longer.
2387923	2389043	What in the hell is up with that?
2389123	2391204	And no, it's not because we kept taking breaks.
2391344	2392905	It just was a long-ass game.
2392925	2393585	It was no shorter.
2394325	2398247	Nobody's gonna get this joke but you, Rob, but you can be my puppet master anytime.
2399554	2400054	How foul.
2402595	2406316	But how long did the... I ended up having to leave around midnight because I was kind of afraid.
2406496	2410878	Well, A, I was tired, and B, I was afraid I wasn't going to be able to park when I got back here if I waited any longer.
2410938	2412098	But how was the rest of the night?
2412938	2413138	Good.
2413178	2418760	We ended up playing Hear Me Out for, well, the majority of the night.
2418800	2423382	I mean, we played Poppin' 10 also, but yeah, that other game was kind of weird.
2424989	2428593	Also, DDArcoholic made sushi from scratch.
2428613	2431736	It was really good, but it was kind of interesting because she used wieners in it.
2431856	2433918	Like, she used hot dogs instead of fish.
2433938	2435160	She put, like, hot dogs in there.
2435480	2436501	But it was actually really good.
2436521	2437222	It was kind of weird.
2437883	2438824	I just thought it was neat.
2439124	2440105	It was very resourceful.
2440125	2440605	It was a good idea.
2441706	2444587	Anyway, we're going to take a break.
2444607	2447288	When we come back from this break, we're going to talk a little bit more about 2DX8 style.
2447348	2449088	We're going to talk a little more about Pop Music 10.
2449789	2453470	I want to play the new remix of I Feel for you guys.
2453510	2458811	We played it on Thursday night, but I know nobody listens to Outside the Box on Thursday night, but more of you guys listened tonight.
2458831	2462912	So we're going to play the new I Feel mix from Service Pack.
2462972	2463853	I keep calling it Service Pack.
2463893	2467194	Song Pack 7 from Ultramix 2 because a lot of people don't want to hear that.
2467234	2468074	So we're going to play that for you guys.
2468374	2470117	and plenty more when we come back from this break.
2470177	2473141	In this break, though, some music from DDR Festival.
2473482	2477367	Because we haven't really gotten to hear much music from DDR Festival yet, but we have some songs for you guys.
2477387	2482254	We're going to hear Superstar, Diamonds, and Cutie Honey on this break.
2482595	2483236	We'll be right back.
2496439	2516369	Slide it on a piece of paper Got a feeling I'll see you later There's something about this, let's keep it moving And if it's good, that's to hear something cooking Is that what you want to wrap it through?
2516929	2520231	I'm feeling some connection to the things you do
2523647	2527088	What is it that makes me feel like this?
2527288	2544552	I don't know who you are, but you must be some kind of superstar Cause you got all I need, no matter where you are You just wanna make me feel like this What is it that makes me feel like this?
2544633	2546313	I don't know who you are
2551727	2552908	Thank you for watching!
2612054	2614516	Thank you for watching!
2660403	2661964	Thank you for watching!
2694136	2702298	Kurohayari no Onna no Kou, Oshiri no Chisana Onna no Kou Kono Uke ga Hai, Datte Nandaka Saisei, Saisei, Saisei, Saisei, Saisei, Saisei, Saisei, Saisei, Saisei, Saisei, Saisei,
2723977	2724657	Honeyfuck!
2724717	2732461	I'm a hot girl, I'm a hot girl, I'm a hot girl, I'm a hot girl, I'm a hot girl,
2753533	2757114	Mr. Random Person on the Street, who by the way is not an actor,
2780683	2783365	What do you think of the Orange Lounge B-Money Music & More show?
2783646	2790792	The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.
2791133	2793154	It's unearthly.
2793355	2797098	It's like being at a club, except you don't have to actually ask someone to dance.
2797378	2799200	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
2799741	2814071	Festival has some strange music in it, it's honestly, I didn't bother to buy Festival, I just, I didn't think there was enough in it for me, because I had Extreme, and I have an Xbox, so, and I had Ultramix One, which is where a lot of songs came from, but Festival certainly has some quirky little songs in it, doesn't it?
2814931	2816292	Interesting, that's all I have to say.
2816732	2822036	Although I love Superstar, I, it's almost worth buying the mix for that, but not really, because that's like 80 bucks.
2822336	2824157	Also, it has different steps.
2824397	2829018	Yeah, it does have different steps for a lot of the songs that were on Ultramix 1, but I don't know.
2830279	2839722	Honestly, with Ultramix 2 now and the fact that you can make your own edits, I have a feeling that any day now we're going to start seeing those steps get uploaded to Xbox Live, so I'm not really too concerned about it.
2840462	2843583	It's just somebody has to take the effort, and that person's not going to be me because I'm lazy.
2845524	2845744	Anyway.
2846675	2847716	Uh, 2DX8Style.
2848176	2852399	Got a chance to check it out over at, um, Navi, Pop Music Horror.
2852419	2852799	He has it.
2852819	2854120	I got to check it out earlier this week.
2854500	2856241	And man do I suck at 2DX now.
2856341	2856921	I mean, seriously.
2856941	2857742	Oh my god, me too.
2857842	2860383	I haven't played 2DX seriously in quite a while.
2860484	2861804	I didn't really get into 7th style.
2861844	2862685	I played it one time.
2863465	2872711	A lot of this has to do with the fact that my controller is broken, and I'd rather buy myself a lot of other useless crap, like iPods and, uh, things like that, than buy...
2873431	2874393	A new 2DX controller.
2874853	2877697	And I seriously think that's the reason that I haven't been playing a whole lot of 2DX.
2878017	2880500	But 8th style is pretty sweet, I gotta say.
2880520	2881922	It has a lot of great new songs in it.
2882903	2884365	Those of you guys that listen to the show regularly...
2884824	2886545	You already know how I feel about Everyday Lovely Day.
2886585	2887226	Like, I love that song.
2887566	2889607	And then, of course, it has a bunch of 2DX Red songs in it.
2891109	2895532	Well, not a bunch, but three, which I consider to be a bunch for, you know, preview, because usually it's only like one or two.
2897553	2900755	And then, some of the new consumer videos are pretty funny.
2901556	2902777	Like, Step Into The New World.
2903017	2904458	I don't really like that song a whole lot.
2904498	2905499	The song kind of, meh.
2905859	2906940	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2923183	2926506	And then also another video I love is Lovebox.
2926786	2935353	I don't know if you guys got to see this video at all, but Lovebox is the one that has, I think it's Meg and one of her cohorts or something, I don't know, an uncredited person.
2936033	2939616	They're dressed up as these like Austin Powers dance chicks, kind of.
2940316	2944820	Like they're all dressed in these like 60s hippie, like things you'd see on Laugh-In.
2944840	2945821	You remember that old show Laugh-In?
2946181	2947342	Like when the people would be dancing?
2947982	2953985	It was kind of like that, and they're just driving around the city and singing, and they're wearing, like, glow bracelets and stuff.
2954465	2955206	It's really great.
2956086	2956566	Lovebox.
2956746	2957827	I highly recommend this one.
2959168	2962529	Although the song kind of sucks, but the video's great.
2964930	2967232	So, you guys have gotten to play 8-Style a little bit, too.
2967272	2968772	What do you guys think of 2DX 8-Style?
2970573	2972234	I suck at Let Me Go, Ribera.
2973274	2974475	Oh, I remember that song was so great.
2974515	2976116	And the scene kept falling out of my lap.
2977253	2978193	I miss arcades.
2978213	2982015	Look pretty nice.
3006289	3008750	Is this something you think you might have to break down and purchase?
3009070	3009931	I already have purchased it.
3010091	3010511	Oh, have you?
3010771	3011571	I just haven't gotten it yet.
3012231	3014032	You probably mentioned it and I forgot.
3014452	3015953	Yeah, I mentioned it like two weeks ago.
3015973	3016353	That's right.
3016673	3017033	I forgot.
3020335	3023316	Any particularly favorite consumer songs that you like in any song?
3024536	3028478	I haven't heard them enough to truly say yet.
3030063	3038313	I played a new 7 star, I think it was Don't Be Afraid Myself, was one of the, like it's the J-pop one, it's got a really, it's actually got a pretty That song was great!
3038533	3041177	It's got a pretty cool video to it Didn't it have the video in the bathroom?
3041697	3042158	In the shower?
3042577	3043498	I think so?
3043518	3045879	It looked like they were dancing in like a locker room shower.
3045959	3047000	Yes, I think that might have been it.
3047120	3049102	I could only kind of half see the video because I tried to play the song.
3049122	3049602	That song was cool.
3049762	3052784	Yeah, the song is cool, but man, I fucked up that song so bad.
3053005	3057128	Like, it really shows like how out of it on 2DX I am because I can't sight read anymore.
3057448	3061931	Like, I was able to play Attitude and Star Dream and all these songs I used to play all the time on 8th style.
3061971	3063092	I was able to play those just fine.
3063392	3067655	But man, throw something new at me and I just, like, the rhythms and everything didn't make any sense to me.
3068035	3068696	It was so sad.
3069717	3070917	I cry for my 2DX skills.
3071798	3075360	But Dancer, 8Style was worth it just to be able to play Dancer again.
3075420	3078282	Although, is it just me or is something kind of weird at the end of the video?
3078382	3080323	Like it freezes kind of at the end of the video.
3080724	3083005	Like I remember it kind of faded out in the arcade.
3083045	3084386	Maybe I'm just crazy, I don't know.
3085166	3090830	But a lot of 8Style machines had broken videos in the first place, so that's probably the first time a lot of people got to actually play 2DX with the videos.
3091150	3092691	I don't know, pretty cool.
3092751	3094252	Angel, what were your thoughts on 2DX 8Style?
3095598	3099685	Love is Orange, Attitude, and A. That's all I have to say.
3100306	3106897	Because, you know, I used to watch you guys play that all the time, and I was always all envious, and I still am, so, yeah.
3108920	3113501	A is technically a 7th style song, but it does make a repeat in 8th style.
3113641	3121562	It's interesting, they took some of the most noteworthy 7th style songs, like A and Stoic, and they ended up repeating on 8th style after all.
3121582	3123583	So now I'm kind of like, do I really need to get 7th style?
3124183	3130284	But then I remembered, yes, I want to whore Beauty of Silence in the privacy of my own home, is basically what it boils down to.
3130724	3132164	Just like, remember the old arcade days?
3132344	3134044	Frickin' everybody whored Beauty of Silence.
3134084	3134845	Well, almost everybody.
3135825	3137025	I know I was a big part of that, but...
3138435	3142694	Like, players best would be 5-1-1, because all the noobs would play 5-1-1, and then, like, Beauty is Silenced.
3146198	3150901	Anyway, moving on, Poppin' Music 10 was another game I got to check out earlier this week.
3151642	3156225	Pretty cool, I have to admit, I think I kind of like the way 9 is set up a little bit better.
3156325	3168694	I thought the unlock system in 9 was a lot cooler, because 10 has this wacky roulette thing, and Navi had the timing down perfect though, so that he was managing to unlock quite a bit of stuff on the roulette wheel, but it was kind of...
3171316	3177582	I was a little disappointed by that.
3178663	3180144	But the song list was pretty good in 10.
3180185	3181506	There's a lot of great songs I love in 10.
3181546	3184849	Of course, Goonies, you know, we hoard that song like crazy here on Orange Lounge.
3185189	3202761	Arabatia, the Revenge song, love that song, and I actually passed it on, what's the second one up, not EX, that's the third one up, Hyper, is that the second level, it's like Basic and Hyper, see I don't know my poppin' music, it's so sad, the middle one, wherever it's ranked, like a 30 or something, 29, 30, I don't remember
3204608	3216959	Somebody needs to get me $1,000 for Christmas, so that way I can buy an ASC for 2DX, an ASC for pop music, and then import 8Style and as many pop music as I can before I'm bankrupt.
3217880	3221183	So if you guys want to get me $1,000 for Christmas, that would be great.
3225007	3225647	Yeah.
3225727	3228330	Did you play Poppin' 10 at all at that party that you went to, Jamie?
3229861	3230062	Poppin' 10
3239153	3243415	It was pretty, and watching Navi play is just insane.
3243975	3257940	He plays faster than anyone else I've seen, you know, but I just ended up watching it because I knew a lot of people wanted to play Pop Intense, so I just kind of left it at that.
3258440	3260881	Plus, we were busy with Cranium anyway, so, you know.
3263126	3267531	Yeah, by the way, if anybody wants to call us, we just opened up the Skype line.
3267591	3273378	If you want to figure out what that's all about, head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on Interact With Us.
3273918	3279485	And we want to take some phone calls asking you guys that have gotten a chance to play 8th Style or Pop Music 10, what you guys think of it.
3279925	3282368	I have to say that the final verdict on 10, I kind of...
3283752	3289535	I mean, obviously I need to play it more, and obviously I still want it, but I still think I kind of like 9 just a little bit better.
3290175	3296738	I just think 9 had some, it was just set up a little better, just kind of had some better songs, but 10's really good, don't get me wrong.
3296798	3300060	I would still buy 10 in a heartbeat, but I just think I like 9 a little bit better.
3301380	3306723	But, anyway, Arcadian, you got to play a little bit of Poppin' 10, what'd you think?
3307694	3308034	Not bad.
3308895	3312358	I can't compare it to any other ones, because I haven't played any other ones.
3312438	3313619	Oh, I thought you have played the other ones.
3313639	3314819	No, this is the first time I've ever played it.
3314879	3315580	Oh, wow, okay.
3316781	3319603	So that's why you were playing 5-key in the beginning there.
3319623	3321504	I was kind of like, Acadian's playing 5-key.
3322365	3324807	Yeah, that was like three songs, and I said, let's go tonight.
3325147	3328250	And it's okay to play 5-key when you're first learning pop music.
3328270	3328690	That's okay.
3328750	3330231	We're going to take a call real fast.
3330591	3331592	Hi, you're on Orange Lines Radio.
3332453	3333514	Hey there, Sky.
3333534	3334154	Siggy here.
3334374	3334795	Hi, Siggy.
3334815	3335255	How you doing?
3336656	3337377	I'm doing fine.
3337557	3338997	You know what?
3339457	3343019	I finally figured out what you were talking about last week with the 2DX8 style.
3343039	3346360	You remember how you said there was something in it that looked like extreme US?
3346720	3348941	And a lot of people in the chat room were like, what the fuck is he talking about?
3349521	3350021	You remember that?
3350701	3350961	Yeah.
3351021	3352022	I got what you meant now.
3352082	3356983	It was the menu in the beginning kind of had that like round wheel thing.
3357724	3358624	Yeah, it's the menu.
3358964	3359404	Gotcha.
3359824	3362145	So you got your copy of 8th style, yes?
3362485	3362645	Yep.
3362986	3363946	And how have you been enjoying it?
3364854	3366154	Yeah, it's really good.
3366855	3372236	I was one of the lucky ones who got the 2DX Red e-amusement card because after November 18th, they don't have it anymore.
3372636	3372996	Really?
3373556	3373856	Yeah.
3374037	3378118	So, is there anything special about the card or is it just the fact that, hey, I got a card?
3379338	3385760	Actually, I wanted to use the 2DX Red e-amusement card at AI because they have the e-amusement card readers.
3385820	3386560	That's what I heard.
3387520	3392722	Now, I'm actually going to be able to go to Arcade Infinity next week, I'm hoping.
3393162	3394242	The e-amusement card over there
3395424	3399106	Well, I don't have any amusement card because I'm ghetto poor and I haven't bought anything yet.
3399126	3399786	That's what I meant.
3400066	3401047	Yeah, that's what I'm thinking about doing.
3401067	3405669	I'm thinking about buying, depending on how much they cost, I might buy a bunch and give some away here on the station.
3406009	3406569	I'm thinking about it.
3407289	3407990	Yeah, that's cool.
3408230	3409070	Yeah, thinking about it.
3410251	3415393	Yeah, recently I double-aid a V35 on 7-key.
3416313	3420515	See, V35 is one of those songs I used to be really good at, but then I just suck it up now.
3420555	3421436	What is that you're holding up there?
3421536	3421936	A Namco?
3422893	3424534	My Tekken 5 character data card.
3425414	3426174	Get on topic!
3427315	3427775	No, it's cool.
3428776	3430176	Have you gotten to play Pop Music 10 at all?
3430876	3431457	Uh, no.
3432137	3435939	The last time I played Popping Music was Popping Music 9 back in San Francisco.
3436179	3437599	See, but isn't Pop Music 9 great?
3440240	3440941	I think so, anyway.
3441961	3446163	So, anything else you want to share about 2DX8 style, your experiences you're having with it?
3447023	3450865	Well, um... There's a thing about the...
3452085	3461288	Getting the hidden songs, 2DX Red songs, you don't have to, you don't have to, about the easy things, it turns out to be false.
3462689	3463129	What do you mean?
3463869	3474573	You can't play easy songs by unlocking, by using an easy option.
3475073	3476894	So you can't play an easy to unlock those songs?
3477274	3477734	You can.
3478034	3478614	Oh, you can?
3479114	3479374	Yeah.
3479454	3480855	Well, shit, that makes it easy, doesn't it?
3482188	3485172	And what is the requirement again to start unlocking some of these 2DX Red songs?
3485192	3486133	Because I actually don't remember.
3486674	3492260	Play at least about a hundred songs to unlock Spiral Galaxy and Taiyou.
3493642	3493982	Wow.
3494803	3495484	A hundred songs?
3496025	3501652	Well, yeah, just mostly light sevens or, you know, light sevens to seven key songs.
3502065	3503786	I'm not afraid of playing 7-key.
3503806	3505648	I've got to play some more to get better at it.
3505748	3506869	I think it's... Play more Light 7.
3507529	3508990	Just for the heck of it.
3509010	3509491	Just for the heck.
3509731	3517376	I would play... Now, see, Light 7 would be the kind of thing I would play to whore my VJ Army account up if I had one.
3517697	3518998	Hypothetically, if I had one.
3519018	3521399	I'd be all, look at all these triple A's I got!
3521419	3522100	Of course, it was on Light 7.
3522780	3524642	But, man, I'm good.
3524922	3527344	Because I know that there's people out there that do that.
3527544	3528305	I mean, but that's okay.
3528345	3529726	You know, Light 7s are songs, too.
3529746	3530726	You have every right.
3531107	3531487	But, you know,
3532887	3534848	And there's another for Random Plus.
3535268	3538269	You have to play at least 100 songs to unlock Random Plus.
3538569	3545332	And what exactly does Random Plus do again for those that... Random Plus is where the turntable is now included in the shuffle.
3546332	3549313	Oh, okay, I gotcha.
3549613	3553755	That would be so hard if you got some scales that... Oh, God, that's pretty crazy.
3554375	3556376	Especially, you know, especially war games.
3558914	3559734	I hate that song.
3559794	3560875	I can only imagine.
3561155	3563856	Well, Wargame on 7Key was never a big problem for me.
3563876	3566937	For some reason, Scratching, I'm like, I'm okay with it.
3566957	3567897	I like that.
3568297	3572498	Checking You Out was the second 7 star I ever beat, and now I understand it's an 8 star.
3572879	3576940	So, like, I beat an 8 star, like, when I was beating my first 7 star.
3576960	3578100	That is so crazy to me.
3578360	3580261	But, for some reason, Scratching has never bothered me.
3581176	3589942	After you play 100 songs with random, just hold key 2 and then wait for the random to go red.
3591103	3591864	And that's how it works?
3592384	3593225	Yeah, that's how it works.
3593425	3597968	So those of you guys that are feeling a little crazy and want to play some random with the turntable, there you have it.
3599569	3599889	Interesting.
3600249	3603592	What would you say would be your favorite new video in 2DXA style?
3604392	3606714	I haven't seen all of them because I'm really busy playing them.
3607967	3609148	Playing the seven key songs.
3609529	3612311	But I'd say I like Nebula Grasper a lot.
3612531	3614313	Nebula Grasper's got a pretty good video to it.
3614373	3617016	It's one of those futuristic, typical kind of things.
3617056	3619278	It kind of reminded me of Hyperboundary Yate a little bit.
3619318	3623182	Because, you know, that was an LED song too, and it had all the futuristic graphics with it.
3623442	3624503	Kind of reminded me of that a little bit.
3625163	3630168	And I bought a 2DX Red, so I really like Spiral Galaxy as well.
3631409	3632991	Were you able to get the V-Rare when you got...
3633985	3635666	Oh, no, no, I didn't.
3636306	3637607	Just a regular one I ordered.
3637847	3638288	Oh, okay.
3639248	3639508	All right.
3640109	3642030	Well, anything else you want to share about 2DXHTEL?
3642730	3644091	Well, nothing much else.
3644311	3644571	All right.
3644711	3646372	Well, we'll talk to you later then, I guess.
3647033	3647693	Have a good one, Siggy.
3648093	3648353	All right.
3648413	3648613	Later.
3648754	3649034	Later.
3650154	3651155	I like getting phone calls.
3651195	3651715	That was fun.
3652756	3653016	All right.
3653616	3656498	People say in our chat room right now is that they're talking about 2DX too much.
3656538	3659440	Well, it is the news that's going on right now, you know, you guys, but fine.
3660653	3662175	We're going to talk about a little bit of DDR.
3662195	3666238	We're going to try and get the I Feel, the new remix for you.
3666278	3669521	Loki's going to get that taken care of during the next break, right?
3670142	3670422	Yes.
3670742	3670942	Good.
3671082	3673024	Then I guess we're going to go to a break so we can get that song.
3673284	3675987	We're going to hear some music from DDR Festival, some more music.
3676547	3677108	Yes, Jamie.
3678329	3678489	What?
3678509	3678609	What?
3679295	3680275	Udoru...
3703018	3703818	Yeah, that song.
3703999	3706880	There's like a new version of it in Festival, so we're going to hear this.
3706920	3708641	I haven't heard this one yet, so I've got to check this out.
3709021	3716465	A remix of I Need You, which was a song that was kind of eh in DDR Max 2 USA, but we'll hear it and see if it's any better.
3717806	3723568	Here's the thing about I Need You, and it wasn't in, well, yeah, Max 2 USA.
3723769	3726350	This was the one that was on the VRare for the last mix.
3727642	3728463	All right, that wasn't too bad.
3728583	3729323	All right, so we'll check it out.
3729343	3735347	We're going to check out these songs, and we'll be back, and we're going to talk a little bit more about Ultramix 2, some of the news there, and play that new song from Ultramix 2.
3735528	3738590	And, of course, the cage match, FU's of the Week, all that good stuff coming up.
3739110	3745274	And in the chat room, they're saying, look, since you're so white, Sky, just say Dancine Pomponcolin.
3745715	3747016	And even that I can't say right.
3747356	3748977	I just, I wasn't cut out for radio.
3749017	3749497	What can I say?
3749998	3750438	We'll be back.
3776925	3778927	Inchiki, Oji-san, Toujou,いつだって忘れないエディションは偉い人そんなの
3812230	3818656	P, Chara, Odoru, Pompokorin P, Chara, P, Onaka ga Hitta yo!
3821718	3839794	Ano ko mo kono ko mo minna isoite aruite iru yo Denshinbashira no kage kara oowarai keinin to toujou Itsudatte mayowana iki o tsuku wa
3923013	3923835	Thanks for watching!
3966398	3967539	Thank you for watching.
3967759	3969080	See you next time.
3996069	3999723	I don't feel like I'm going to study, but at this point in time, I do.
4034065	4042555	Gaming Radio, so uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.
4042735	4044096	Orange Lounge Radio.
4047881	4049483	God bless you, Tom Brokaw.
4050865	4051866	You know, he finally retired.
4052706	4053046	He did?
4053287	4053607	Yeah.
4054207	4055028	This is his last week.
4055048	4055548	We had time.
4056549	4060191	One of the most highly rated episodes of the show of all time or something like that.
4060211	4060512	I don't know.
4060532	4061032	Something like that.
4061092	4061412	Crazy.
4062953	4066375	Anyway, we are going to be playing the new I Feel remix.
4066395	4066796	We just...
4067296	4068616	We ripped it during the break there.
4068676	4072357	Loki, our tech massa, is working on it right now, trying to get it all perfect.
4072777	4082179	I said we should just rip it out of edit mode, but apparently if you try to rip it in edit mode, it cuts off the very beginning little speech thing, because it starts off and goes, Do you feel it?
4082279	4084600	Like, it sounds like one of those, like, speaking spells or something saying it.
4085220	4086920	And, uh, Loki was like, No!
4087080	4087760	We can't have that!
4088020	4090781	So he made us go back and do it in edit mode, so, whatever.
4091421	4092022	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4119113	4123135	That's Pump Up the Volume where I just go crazy and play whatever.
4123736	4126077	Although if you're in our chat room, you can make a request.
4126197	4128719	And if I think that it doesn't totally suck ass, I'll play it.
4129619	4130140	Amen to that.
4131080	4139265	And then Wednesday nights is the Oldie and Moldie Orange Lounge Radio Show where basically we play a show from two years ago for your listening amusement.
4139625	4141046	Listen to how much we used to suck.
4141086	4143708	If you think we suck now, like we really sucked then.
4144869	4148191	And then Thursday nights, Outside the Box at 7 o'clock.
4148971	4153316	myself, RicePrincess, and LikeyStyle talking about the latest and greatest in video gaming.
4153637	4155119	This last week was a pretty good show.
4155159	4156680	You missed a good time if you missed this week.
4156741	4157782	We had a good time.
4158543	4163008	And then Friday nights, it's not on this station, but it's over on The Freak on DDR Freak Radio.
4163068	4168555	The Rewinds, in case you missed a previous episode of Orange Lounge Radio, you can catch it over there, up to date.
4169175	4174320	Actually, the show they're going to be playing this Friday is last week's show, which was the one where we had the MidiHead interview.
4174740	4178883	If you guys missed the interview with MidiHead, awesome guy, awesome interview.
4178943	4181325	You have to check it out, so go listen to Freak on Friday.
4181405	4187210	Also, the karaoke cage match, by the way, was on last Friday, and of course, Loki won.
4187230	4189091	Was there any surprise in anyone's mind?
4189272	4189752	I don't think so.
4191502	4195525	I've got to plug the LiveJournal community, because we haven't plugged that in a while.
4196345	4204370	If you guys have a LiveJournal, which I know a lot of you do in this day and age, we're starting to move into a LiveJournally-centered internet, head on over to our LiveJournal community.
4204450	4210194	It's just username OrangeLounge on LiveJournal, and if you join it, you get some of the latest announcements on what's going on in the station.
4210514	4217718	Sometimes we propose ideas for changes to the station on our LiveJournal, and we get your feedback there, so it's just a nice little community.
4217978	4220440	It's a way for you to meet other listeners of OrangeLoungeRadio.
4221252	4222152	Crazy people like us.
4224313	4224653	Let's see.
4225093	4225933	DDR Ultramix 2.
4226833	4229494	Been a game we've been talking about a hell of a lot lately, I gotta say.
4229554	4232574	But SongPack, I keep calling it Service Pack.
4232954	4234775	SongPack 7 came out this week.
4234855	4239876	Finally, a lot of us were expecting that SongPack 7 was going to be out when the game came out.
4239896	4241476	But for whatever reason, there was a delay.
4241856	4244777	Sounds like there might have been some kind of bug that prevented things.
4244897	4245197	I don't know.
4245757	4250079	A lot of people bitchin' and moanin' because SongPack 7 has a lot of old songs in it.
4250099	4251760	We were talking about this a little bit last week.
4252541	4256543	But SongPack 7 has End of the Century and La Senorita and Silent Hill.
4257223	4260165	A lot of old classic DDR songs.
4260925	4263226	But I guess played out to a lot of people as well.
4263526	4264147	Era as well.
4264407	4268349	So you get some tack finally in DDR Ultimix 2.
4269990	4272351	But a lot of these songs, since they're old, they're kind of played out.
4272391	4273552	So they're getting a lot of kind of...
4274577	4275458	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4294657	4296517	is another artist that's over on a different drum.
4296557	4300038	The background for this song has the website address.
4300338	4308620	You may have noticed a lot of the different drum songs, a lot of those, like the Jesper Kidd, a lot of the new songs in Ultramix 2 have websites in their background.
4308660	4311120	So it's kind of interesting that we're getting those in some of the song packs as well.
4312440	4322422	But I think in visiting Junk Circuit's website, I think there's actually a lot in common between Junk Circuit and Nuropa, who does the song Standing Still in Time.
4323035	4342564	Because they have the same website contact email So, kind of interesting Alright Anyway They're telling us in the chatroom to stop talking about the song and play the damn thing already That's fine, we'll get to it I'm going to copy it over right now Loki's put the finishing touches on it So we'll go ahead and play that for you But really first, Loki, what did you think of this remix?
4343365	4345866	It's better than the other one You didn't like the other one?
4345906	4347127	Why's that?
4347147	4352289	The other one just kind of sucked I don't know, it was just kind of eh, not much different This is a lot better
4353331	4357974	I do like this one a little bit better too, but I kind of like the old one as well, I gotta admit.
4358114	4359455	So, I don't know, what do I know?
4360636	4363578	Alright, I gotta copy it over.
4367841	4370904	I guess there was a big tournament on Ultramix 2 tonight, online.
4371464	4373405	There was a lot of people talking about it over on DDR Freak.
4373586	4374166	I missed it.
4374887	4379450	It wasn't something, I knew I'd get my ass kicked so I didn't want to participate, but I guess it went pretty well from what I hear.
4380424	4382606	Alright, I'll stop talking and start playing.
4382666	4383367	Here it is.
4383767	4386590	Orange Launch Radio presents the brand new I Feel remix.
4386630	4387791	It's the Junk Circuit mix.
4387991	4388491	Enjoy, guys.
4389212	4389953	Do you feel it?
4413407	4414249	Thank you for watching!
4468348	4469090	Did you hear it?
4499052	4500033	I feel the Junk Circuit Mix
4524505	4525646	Nothing top secure, Yamoga.
4526166	4527107	What'd you think of that, Bradley?
4527147	4533391	I liked it, except I think that I feel that little... Hold the bottom of the mic, it's breaking up a little bit, the cord's loose.
4533771	4535612	That's alright, we're ghetto here, we don't have good equipment.
4536452	4537553	Oh, now you're cutting out completely.
4538734	4539074	There you are.
4539214	4539534	Am I here?
4539654	4540255	Yes, you're here.
4540675	4541796	No, now you're gone again!
4545498	4545678	Nope.
4546759	4548620	We need to buy a new mic, I think, something's going on.
4549080	4550241	Steal this one real fast.
4551940	4552220	Dough.
4552240	4553681	That one's dying.
4554701	4556322	I'm going to cry for that microphone.
4556362	4558823	There we go.
4558863	4559283	Try that one.
4559603	4561084	Yeah, I thought it was pretty good.
4561684	4566626	Except I think that little computer I feel it voice is a bad touch.
4567507	4568968	If they left it out, it would make it better.
4569508	4570868	Jazz in our chatroom agrees with you.
4570908	4574830	He says the whole can you feel it samples just sounds fucking cheesy is what he says.
4575290	4575530	Yeah.
4576111	4578132	And Jamie's yelling from the laundry room that she agrees.
4578912	4579052	Yeah.
4579660	4580361	Overall, I like it.
4581061	4582302	Yeah, I think it's pretty good.
4582683	4588868	I think the, uh, can you feel it is a little weird, but it, I don't know, it's different.
4589689	4590850	I give them points for trying.
4590910	4592371	It's a good remix.
4592411	4593412	It's a fun song to play.
4595313	4596234	The steps are kind of interesting.
4596254	4598736	It took something good and added a bunch of extraneous crap to it.
4599697	4602860	The steps, is there any DDR remix that you've liked so far?
4604662	4608551	I liked the Let This Face one that you interviewed last week.
4608571	4609012	Middy Head?
4609213	4609493	Yeah.
4609634	4609914	Okay.
4609934	4611157	That one was good.
4613571	4614131	What's his face?
4616012	4616872	I wasn't here!
4620053	4620973	I wasn't here!
4636597	4637038	What is that?
4637138	4638479	DDR Console Games Forum?
4638759	4641941	There's a little sticky announcement thingy where you can ask MidiHead a question.
4641981	4650528	So if you missed getting your question last week, because we took some questions from our listeners, but if you missed your chance to ask MidiHead a question, they are taking question submissions right now.
4650588	4652169	So go check that out if you'd like.
4652549	4653870	What did you think of that remix, Angel?
4654190	4656672	You like everything, so I know you're going to have something good to say about it.
4658394	4664038	Well, I liked the first one from Silent Hill when we first did that one.
4664670	4665170	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4688618	4690759	I want to take some calls on the Skype line.
4690819	4695860	If you want to give us a call, head on over to www.OrangeLaunchRadio.com and click on Interact With Us.
4696240	4701782	I'm kind of curious about some of your guys' feedback on Ultramix 2, specifically SongPack 7, if you've had a chance to check it out.
4702322	4717306	Any online experiences you might have had on Ultramix 2, and even if you want to talk about a DDR Festival, because we haven't talked a whole lot about DDR Festival, and that's just because none of us in Sacramento, I don't think a single person in Sacramento that I know of, anyway, has bought the game, so we don't know what to say about it.
4718214	4721095	and to add to that, if you'd like to talk about Drawn together as well.
4722376	4727978	No, that's not... What?
4729718	4730599	I have an opinion, no I don't.
4732339	4732759	Shut up.
4734600	4736421	Did you ever get a chance to play Ultramix 2, Jamie?
4736521	4737961	Did you guys pick that up at your place?
4739202	4739362	No.
4739442	4740042	Are you going to get it?
4742170	4742631	It's fun.
4742931	4743912	Dot, dot, dot.
4743972	4744653	It's fun!
4745434	4745855	Maybe.
4746155	4746596	You should.
4746836	4750000	The house has been rearranged in Halo 2 land position.
4751061	4753564	I have no room to put any dance pads or anything.
4754485	4755386	Look at this place.
4755647	4756768	Hello, you can sit on our camp.
4756788	4757849	You have infinitely more room.
4757910	4758490	Dan's got the...
4760052	4767358	Normally in my living room we have the TV on one wall, the couch on one wall, and the loveseat back on the far wall.
4768239	4775705	Now the loveseat and couch are back to back with just enough room to have a place to put your legs and an Xbox between TVs.
4776686	4778247	It is currently in LAN mode.
4778848	4782110	Are you guys hosting a bunch of Halo 2 parties or something?
4782130	4783832	Dan did on his birthday on Monday.
4784072	4785173	Oh, his birthday was Monday, huh?
4785213	4785493	Yeah.
4785573	4786254	Happy birthday, Dan.
4787148	4788128	I wasn't here for that.
4788969	4790269	He told me I should feel guilty.
4791530	4792430	Oh, now that's not true.
4795011	4795571	That's not true.
4799092	4801873	Well, I don't think anybody's calling us on the Skype line, so what can we do?
4802533	4803494	Damn it, they suck!
4803534	4806515	Except now they're talking about Drawn Together in our chat room.
4806995	4808635	You freaking ass, Loki.
4809676	4810036	Jerk.
4811297	4818625	Loki, now you keep telling me that you're going to start playing Ultramix 2 because I notice that every time I've been playing it, you're like, yeah, I need to play that.
4819486	4820668	Yeah, I need to play that.
4821288	4822289	Are you actually going to be playing?
4822329	4823551	Oh, we're finally getting a call.
4824292	4829037	You're going to reprieve for now, but as soon as this call is done, we're going to ask you about that.
4829337	4830639	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4832264	4833104	Legend of Zaku here.
4833364	4834005	Hi, Zaku.
4834065	4834485	How are you?
4835145	4840086	I don't have that much to share because, you know, as I said, you know, I'm a college student.
4840106	4841067	Then get off the phone!
4841087	4841927	No, I'm kidding.
4841967	4843787	I don't have a PS2 or an Xbox.
4843847	4847608	I might get one this Christmas, but I'm kind of iffy on which one should I get.
4848289	4849529	You know, Bomani-wise, that is.
4849649	4851410	So you don't have a PS2 or an Xbox.
4851430	4855551	So you're asking the age-old question, which system should I get?
4855831	4859732	No, but with regards to not only, you know, games, but also Bomani as well.
4861229	4863151	I'm adding a little kick to it.
4863171	4865033	And you have nothing to add about Drawn Together.
4866114	4866554	He didn't hear that.
4866594	4867055	What?
4867115	4869638	And you have nothing to add about Drawn Together.
4870058	4872240	I did see South Park last Wednesday, but that was about it.
4872260	4872761	No, no, no.
4872881	4875023	Quit trying to derail this program, Loki, Zaku.
4875323	4875543	Shame.
4875944	4877966	All right.
4878807	4881569	As far as Xbox versus PS2, here it is, basically.
4882549	4896237	If you're interested in something that's going to remind you of the arcade, something that's going to bring the arcade experience to the home, something where there's a lot of different songs available, something with iToy support, if you want to get your hands involved, go for the PS2.
4897317	4903861	If you want to get something where you can play online, and you want to play against other people that live around, go for the Xbox.
4903961	4909864	But here's the thing, you being the starving college student, that means you're going to have to pay for the Xbox, Xbox Live, and then five bucks a song pack.
4910185	4910545	So...
4912065	4912387	I don't know.
4913211	4916187	What are you looking... Yeah, but also with the PS2, I might have to mod it.
4916980	4921222	I have to mod if I'm going to play 2DX or any of those lovely Pomani games besides DDR.
4921322	4925943	Well, that's very true, and that's going to cost you money as well, I mean, if you want to play the Japanese games.
4926303	4934086	And that's the other thing, if you plan on modding your PS2, which, you know, can have mixed results, I guess I hear now it's pretty easy to mod it.
4934106	4935146	I live in the city.
4935166	4935967	I live in the city.
4936047	4938388	Chinatown's not that far, and I can always get it modded there.
4938428	4938948	Alright, alright.
4939308	4939688	Fair enough.
4939728	4940868	So you can get it modded PS2.
4940908	4944950	So if you're interested in 2DX or Poppin' or any of that stuff, you're definitely going to want to get the PS2.
4946286	4947508	Here's the other thing to consider, too.
4949370	4954277	We have PS3 and Xbox 2 likely to be out in stores before next Christmas.
4954297	4963449	We don't know for sure, but if I were a betting man, I would say those things are going to be in stores next Christmas, which means the systems that are out there now, their prices will be halved.
4964522	4966883	or they'll be $100 or less.
4966943	4970245	Yeah, I probably already took notice of that.
4970305	4978969	And I think 9th style, if it does come out next year for PS2, I don't know if it's going to jump into the next console or just be the last PS2 2DX game.
4979169	4983932	I'm kind of hoping that there is a 9th style and a 10th style pretty back-to-back.
4984012	4986213	I'm kind of hoping that those games come out pretty quickly.
4986493	4990295	PS2 or just one for PS2 and the next for PS3.
4990595	4991636	I hope they both come out.
4992537	4998993	I think it's a given that PS3 will play PS2 games, so they ought to just both come out for PS2.
4999966	5008592	Yeah, seeing as, you know, I already noticed that 2DX games come out, you know, there's always 2DX games coming out for PS2 every single year.
5009352	5016377	And basically, from what I'm speculating, from what I'm predicting, Nightstar might come out in May next year or something, or near the summer.
5016637	5017037	Who knows?
5018138	5018779	Nobody really knows.
5018799	5020040	I'm just taking a guess here.
5020060	5020520	Yeah, taking a shot.
5020540	5021821	I'm just taking an educated guess from...
5023396	5026999	But, you know, alright, I think pretty much I... Well, you know what?
5027539	5032563	Then again, 9th style would make a lot of sense on PlayStation 3 because then they could fuck up the timing.
5033884	5037306	By putting it on a new system, just like the arcade one.
5037907	5047354	And if I get a PS2 for Bomani, I'm gonna have to pay money for the 2DX controller, poppin' music, so it's gonna be equally the same if I'm gonna have to try going after both.
5048186	5054790	Because one will have more peripherals and the other will have more services and things to buy.
5055031	5061175	Now, also to even confuse things even more, there's also the Phantom console that's coming out.
5062495	5063256	How is that confusing?
5063456	5065137	Who gives a shit about the Phantom?
5065237	5065798	Seriously.
5066978	5067479	What's that?
5069340	5069920	Exactly.
5070140	5070621	Exactly.
5070841	5073503	Hey, I've got pictures of the dough on orangeonradio.com.
5073963	5074603	And I hear rumors of a...
5077384	5078986	Engage 2 that's shaped like a banana.
5080187	5080808	I have rumors.
5080828	5082730	Better than a taco.
5083010	5084752	I've heard rumors of a bowel movement.
5084792	5086554	I'm about to have after this show.
5090258	5090979	Here's the thing, though.
5091039	5093762	If you're looking for Bimani, assistant for Bimani, don't get a GameCube.
5095387	5110016	of course not, hell no, gamecubes are not worth the money hey, don't you be knocking the gamecube, it's a beautiful system I'm not knocking it, I mean, it's cheap, but I mean don't make me come out there and cut you, because I will what, you're going to travel 3,000 miles to cut you?
5110277	5114839	to cut you, yes do you even know where in New York do I live?
5114879	5120183	I'll send my minions yeah, sure, and do you want a cookie for that, Skye?
5121814	5123115	That's right.
5123616	5125157	Yeah.
5125197	5127259	Live 365 has it all on record, I think.
5127919	5128780	Sure it does.
5128900	5132223	What IP and what school am I doing this from?
5132423	5135466	You're going to the school of hang-up in about five seconds there, buddy.
5136346	5136927	Thanks a lot.
5137047	5137767	Thanks a lot, Sky.
5137808	5138308	All right.
5138348	5138888	You're welcome.
5139969	5140870	Take care, Zaku.
5141651	5141971	All right.
5141991	5143212	Now I know what to choose later.
5148696	5149877	Zaku's always fun to talk to.
5153567	5155008	I like bullying him a little bit.
5155088	5155728	He's fun.
5155888	5156428	He's a fun guy.
5156528	5156808	All right.
5157368	5159609	We're going to go to the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.
5159629	5160429	We've got to get into that.
5164211	5173654	Last week in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, Loki was the winner, but it doesn't matter because that was a one-time thing, so...
5174568	5177269	That gets thrown out and we go back to the cage match at hand.
5177389	5180649	Our reoccurring winner, Gwen Stefani, What You Waiting For?
5180729	5184170	It's the song I put in the cage match, believe it or not, three weeks ago.
5184570	5189112	So because it won last week by default, this is the last time it can win.
5189412	5193793	And if it wins tonight, it'll become the second song in Orange Lounge history to be retired from the cage match.
5194353	5194893	So we'll see.
5196353	5196733	We'll see.
5196853	5198474	Loki seems convinced it's going to be gone.
5199034	5201354	Jamie, you have something you want to say?
5202135	5202475	Thank you.
5204487	5205007	What a woman.
5207528	5207929	All right.
5208969	5209449	Here we go.
5209509	5210750	Here's a clip of last... Oh, yeah.
5210770	5211830	The way the cage match works.
5212110	5213071	You've got to be in our chat room.
5213091	5214792	You've got to be listening live on Sunday night.
5215032	5216792	www.orangellandradio.com.
5216812	5217413	Click on chat.
5217673	5219374	We're going to play three songs for you guys.
5219594	5220834	One song from each host.
5221234	5226276	We only play a clip of last week's winner, though, because you already heard the song back when it first won.
5226296	5228417	Because you listen to Orange Lounge Radio every week, right?
5228437	5229238	Right?
5229258	5229578	Right?
5230908	5240763	Anyway, then you're going to send in your vote and the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio 24-7 Balmati Music and More program.
5240803	5241404	Alright, here it is.
5241564	5242105	Enough talking.
5242445	5244408	A clip of song number one you can vote for tonight.
5244709	5246612	Gwen Stefani, what you waiting for?
5274315	5276038	Thank you for watching!
5302290	5303371	Thank you for watching!
5345450	5347811	All right, that was song number one in tonight's cage match.
5349032	5350772	Gwen Stefani with Whatcha Waitin' For.
5350812	5352013	What's so goddamn funny?
5352673	5356134	Talking about combining different groups.
5356174	5358935	We've got Britney Spears and Flo and then B4U.
5358955	5359616	We have B4U.
5359636	5362637	You guys are crazy.
5366121	5369102	All right, let's get to song number two in tonight's Cage Match.
5369142	5370062	Jamie, it's your pick.
5370503	5375765	Mine's an apology for making everyone listen to that bad remix of Emerge.
5376445	5380828	So I put in the original instead, just because I really wanted to play it and I don't care if it wins or not.
5381328	5381668	All right.
5381968	5386890	I think the last one I did was Ersatz, so this is Fisher Spooner with Emerge.
5387090	5389892	Fisher Spooner with Emerge, the non-remixed version.
5389912	5392213	I was going to say, I thought you had a Fisher Spooner song in before.
5392233	5393574	I did Ersatz before.
5393594	5394254	Oh, okay.
5395896	5396997	All right, well, here it is, you guys.
5397037	5399698	Song number two you can vote for tonight, Fischer Spooner, Emerge.
5400218	5400638	Enjoy.
5426797	5428399	Thanks for watching!
5454821	5454981	Hi.
5455041	5455181	Hi.
5455221	5455301	Hi.
5477506	5481007	You don't need to be much from nothing You don't need to step up
5511930	5516713	Looks good, sounds good, looks good, feels good too, feels good too, feels good too
5532626	5533226	Thanks for watching!
5581069	5581374	DaDaDa
5612205	5613527	Uh-huh, that's right
5669437	5671419	Hi, that was song number two in tonight's case match.
5695578	5696779	Fisherspooner with Emerge.
5696919	5702662	Let's go around and get everybody's emerging thoughts on that song, starting off with the lovely DarkSakura.
5703983	5707305	I always like that song, so it gets a 9 from me, but I don't really care.
5708526	5710587	An apathetic 9 from DarkSakura.
5710987	5713389	Seriously, I just put it in just because I wanted to listen to it.
5714537	5715838	That's a good enough reason to send me.
5716699	5718480	Arcadian, see if that mic will work again for you.
5720362	5720662	No.
5720902	5721523	Is it on?
5721603	5721903	There we go.
5721943	5722544	Is it okay?
5722764	5722964	Yes.
5724926	5725406	It's alright.
5725486	5728349	No, I don't really like it all that much, so I'll give it a six.
5728769	5730030	A six from Arcadian.
5730430	5730711	Loki!
5732913	5733533	I didn't get it.
5734834	5735655	Was that supposed to be a song?
5735995	5740059	Because it sounded just like some stupid synth in the background and them talking over it.
5742220	5742761	So I don't get it.
5743632	5745993	I'm trying to go, it sounds like a Beck's type thing, but no.
5747354	5747574	No.
5748475	5751077	I can't imagine this being actually better than the original remix.
5751697	5756160	Of course, I don't remember that remix of it, so, um, I get the one.
5756440	5756660	Sorry.
5758969	5759249	You know what?
5759350	5761431	I actually dig the synths in that song quite a bit.
5761511	5765514	I see that as kind of like maybe a song I would listen to while I'm driving home late at night.
5766335	5769037	It's pretty cool and it's got very much of an 80s vibe going for me.
5769477	5771679	My only complaint is that it's a little quiet.
5771779	5773580	I'd like something maybe a little bit more driving.
5773980	5775942	But I actually like the synths.
5775982	5777863	I've become a total synth pop whore lately.
5778203	5780025	And yes, a lot of that has to do with Ultramix too.
5780405	5781746	So that song kind of fits in for me.
5781806	5782727	So I'm giving it an 8.
5782907	5783067	Angel!
5784168	5784368	Angel!
5786632	5787532	I liked it a lot.
5788233	5789133	I'll give it an 8.
5791093	5793234	Alright, remember, it doesn't matter what we think, though.
5793274	5794774	It's all up to you guys.
5794874	5796815	But you get a third song to pick from tonight.
5797475	5799195	And Loki is being cheap tonight.
5799255	5800415	Let's hear what he's going to pick.
5801836	5803136	Thank you for the introduction.
5803736	5807877	Now, this song, as we already heard, it was last week we played it.
5808397	5810978	This is their cover of The Fix.
5811858	5813558	Midi Head with Deeper and Deeper.
5814679	5815599	Or Monolithic, whatever.
5816763	5818427	Actually, it's Monolithic, but yeah.
5818767	5825122	Alright, so here it is, song number three tonight, a cover of The Fix with Monolithic with Deeper and Deeper.
5825262	5826004	Enjoy, we'll be back.
5902482	5908365	We're gonna take the call and get deeper, and deeper, and deeper We're gonna take the call and get deeper, and deeper, and deeper
5943149	5952434	I get deeper, and deeper The more I see, the more I fall The late night, the girl takes the call I get deeper, and deeper I see the edge, I look up The place to hide, I'm gonna take the call I see the edge, I look up
5991013	5991640	Thank you for watching!
6037880	6046985	And I see the edge, I look, I fall And I get deeper, and deeper The more I see, the more I fall Nobody's eyes, you better take the call I get deeper
6094643	6100387	Song number three in tonight's cage match, Monolithic doing a cover of The Fix there, deeper and deeper.
6101601	6105804	Let's go deep into our... I can't make a reference.
6105844	6107845	Jamie, what did you think?
6108725	6111507	I liked everything about the song except for the guy's voice.
6112888	6119232	So, it gets... Well, damn, the music gets a 10, the voice gets a 1.
6120793	6125876	So... Loki says it gets an 11.
6127683	6128064	Seven.
6128644	6129124	Seven, alright.
6129144	6129965	Only because of the voice.
6130606	6130866	Alright.
6131507	6131827	Bradley.
6132888	6133468	Can you hear me?
6134089	6134709	Yes, I can hear you.
6135070	6136111	Yeah, I thought it was pretty cool.
6136171	6136751	I'll give it a nine.
6137352	6138433	A nine from Bradley.
6138853	6139153	Loki!
6141615	6142276	It gets a ten.
6142696	6148742	And, if you like this, go to midihead.com, buy his albums, and then tell him that Orange Lounge Radio sent you.
6149002	6152505	You'll get access to this wonderful song, as well as many other remixes he's done.
6154549	6161915	I've been listening to that song quite a bit on my new iPod lately, so I have to admit, it's actually a really good song.
6162916	6167699	I just hope we don't, he doesn't turn into the new Echo Image on this station, seriously.
6170361	6173924	No, but actually it's a great song, it's a great cover, and I like it.
6174044	6175285	Nine, Angel.
6177587	6183031	I like it a lot, good cover, and good artist, so you know what, nine and a half.
6184591	6184871	All right.
6185633	6188637	An explicit who just walked in doesn't get to vote because he didn't hear that song.
6189859	6190179	All right.
6191381	6192102	All right, guys.
6192182	6193864	You're going to place your vote momentarily.
6193904	6197690	But first, here is a recap of the three songs you can vote for tonight.
6197770	6200414	Song number one you can vote for tonight, Gwen Stefani, What You Waiting For.
6209389	6213791	Song number two you can vote for tonight is Fisher Spooner with Emerge.
6214012	6218854	And song number three you can vote for tonight is Monolithic doing a cover of The Fix, Deeper and Deeper.
6248263	6251208	Alright, place vote now.
6251348	6255014	Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.
6258299	6259120	And we will see what happens.
6259861	6262025	Alright, moving right along.
6264045	6268927	I've been perusing some of the message forums out there lately, DDR Freak namely being one of them.
6269307	6272868	I thought there was this very interesting thread over there in Random Chat.
6272888	6275709	You know how they do a lot of really crazy stuff over in Random Chat?
6276029	6277529	You know the Random Chat stuff, right?
6277809	6278830	Right, DarkSakura?
6279310	6280390	Being a mod over there and everything?
6282831	6283071	Yes.
6283632	6285893	What's this random that you talk about?
6285913	6288875	We don't know anything about random on this show.
6289935	6301022	Just out of curiosity, this is total tangent, but since I'm thinking DarkSakura here and how much she loves to lock topics over there, what would you say would be the most favorite topic you've gotten to lock on random chat?
6303884	6305024	Hi, please lock this.
6306766	6307066	Yes.
6308787	6310388	I've had a please lock this before.
6313717	6314958	Hi, please lock this, alright.
6316359	6318880	There's an interesting topic going on there in random chat.
6318900	6321062	It's called, do you actually play DDR anymore?
6321702	6326705	And I thought it was kind of interesting just seeing how many people actually don't play DDR anymore.
6327046	6332529	So I kind of was going to go around the room a little bit and see, do you play DDR anymore?
6333470	6336412	And if not, why are you doing this show?
6338891	6339391	I'll start.
6340011	6341032	Do I play DDR anymore?
6341152	6343033	A little bit, not as much nearly as I used to.
6343253	6345194	I play a little bit of Ultramix 2 at home.
6345734	6347756	Most of my DDR playing is Controller Controller.
6348723	6353546	The reason why I don't play DDR that much anymore is because the quality of arcades in this area went downhill significantly.
6354567	6358290	Konami of Japan can suck it for not putting out a new mix in a long time.
6358330	6361892	I think that has a lot to do with the reason why I haven't played DDR in a long time.
6363273	6370278	The home version is the only thing keeping it alive to me, but I just can't motivate my fat ass to pull out the ignition pad.
6370778	6374581	Especially when the ignition pad, as good of a dance pad as it is, it's still not the arcade.
6375081	6377303	I want to play DDR in the arcade, and there's no
6378016	6380177	I played DDR when I was in Alabama.
6407810	6408391	Well, there you go.
6408951	6410593	Do you play it regularly besides that?
6410853	6412735	When I'm somewhere that has a machine, I'll play.
6414417	6417541	I've got more reason to play now than I play dock at RVGL.
6419022	6420865	I'll set out a little bit of money and go play some DDR.
6421693	6428218	I played like one game of DDR when I went to go play dock at Derby Owner's Club over at Roseville Golf Land, but here's the problem, I fucking failed Breakdown!
6428398	6442189	Now, you know, it's a 9-footer, it's a more difficult song at the end of the scale, but you have to remember, I'm somebody who was playing DDR religiously for quite some time, and, you know, I... I just... It just makes me sad how much stamina I've lost, you know?
6443470	6443790	Alright.
6444151	6445952	Arkadian, do you actually play DDR anymore?
6447645	6454227	Not really, mainly because my foot's been hurting, and I haven't had that much money lately.
6455007	6460249	Now I might be able to go once my foot feels 100%, or 90% at least.
6461390	6467151	Maybe more in the future, because it's been so long and I need to get off my fat ass, and I sit around too much.
6468712	6469112	And so on.
6470873	6472513	Loki, do you play DDR anymore?
6473614	6474694	DDR and Final Fantasy XI?
6477865	6478846	Addict!
6480107	6480587	Yes, I do.
6480767	6482448	I'm Step Mania every once in a while.
6482629	6483049	I'll play it.
6484990	6495458	But, yes, to answer your question earlier about Xbox and stuff and if I was ever going to play it, no, because I'm going to actually set up my Step Mania cabinet to be playing the stuff.
6495498	6501403	In fact, that's why I bought crap today to cut the other control panel for the actual select arrows and stuff.
6502043	6502484	That's why...
6503806	6504847	I was going to do that today.
6504887	6514035	I'm hopefully going to build that this week because I bought a while back a new IPAC thing to hook it all up and I have to see if it's going to get fried as easy as the other one.
6514616	6519260	So it's all contingent on that, whether I get to play it some more.
6519520	6529329	I don't play in the arcade because the arcade's too far away, takes too much of my time, cuts into my Final Fantasy XI time, and the arcade's broken all the time.
6529529	6529609	I'm
6530689	6531989	That and I'm way fucking out of shape.
6532149	6535110	I go and play like a seven footer on doubles and I'm ready to die.
6535831	6537671	I mean, whatever happened to me.
6538651	6539372	That's what I want to know.
6539812	6540752	It never used to be this hard.
6541352	6543993	But once I get back in shape, yeah, I'd play a lot more.
6544033	6550475	I just need to finish my arcade cabinets before I move out of here, so that's priority one.
6553300	6561610	You don't play a whole lot of DDR in the arcade or at home anymore, yet you're very gung-ho about this cabinet and everything.
6561710	6562551	Why do you think that is?
6562631	6565855	Is it just a love for the basic concept of the game?
6565875	6568618	I like building stuff, have you noticed?
6568918	6569799	Stuff that doesn't work.
6570740	6571842	Like the portal to hell.
6572062	6572863	The portal to hell.
6574598	6585966	Also, I noticed you tend to build things halfway through and don't finish them, such as these lovely metal pads that have been sitting over here for the past... Can we play Xbox or PS2 games with them right now?
6587426	6594111	We can if I hooked up the other, the, um, iPack thing, because all I have to do is switch out the old iPack and it plugs right in and it works.
6594591	6603717	But the thing is, the thing is I haven't bought the adapter for the Xbox or the PS2 yet because it was hooking up directly to my computer.
6605550	6606191	Yes, I could.
6606431	6607492	I could if I wanted to.
6607572	6609834	It just would take a while because I'd have to wire everything.
6611515	6617360	But it's just that those things... I would be curious how thick the layer of dust is on those metal pads that are sitting right there.
6618461	6621564	Can I go wipe my finger on it and see how much dust is on them?
6623465	6623946	Here you go, Loki.
6626628	6629070	They also buy the air intake, just so you know.
6629090	6632873	Look at that.
6632953	6633474	That's a little radio.
6635123	6636844	Oh yeah, okay, I have an idea.
6637105	6642209	Let me wipe the dust off of my little, my computer desk here, because I get quite a bit used to it.
6642309	6643030	Oh, look, it's gray.
6643330	6646592	Let me wipe the dust off of every, there's dust everywhere in here.
6647033	6649315	It's not a surprise that there's dust on those.
6650876	6656641	That and they're right next to the air intake, which I'm sure is not good for the air conditioner one bit, but that's alright.
6658622	6662806	No wonder it smells like wood in this house all the time, this strange mix of metal and everything.
6663502	6665243	All right, uh, explicit.
6665523	6666523	Welcome to the show, by the way.
6666543	6667684	I noticed you just ran in there.
6668004	6669004	Put down the DS for a minute.
6669024	6670645	Quit chatting with Angel on Pickup Chat for a minute.
6671305	6672685	That mic's been giving us... Yeah.
6673226	6675066	They are like, what, eight feet?
6676067	6676767	What the hell?
6677127	6680948	This is what... I think they're exchanging special pictures.
6681148	6682249	This is what's wrong, people.
6683309	6684450	You need to talk.
6685390	6686270	Talky-talky.
6686610	6690132	It's like, you know, the people IMing each other when they're sitting in a cafe.
6690532	6690812	Talk.
6692148	6694990	They're writing penis back and forth to each other.
6695110	6695790	Okay, okay.
6696411	6697691	No, Rob, that's you last night.
6697731	6698132	Thank you!
6698492	6699072	Thank you.
6699433	6702014	You gotta hold the mic at the bottom, because it's going out tonight.
6702214	6703235	That mic's on its last legs.
6703255	6703855	Can you hear me now?
6703915	6704736	Yes, I can hear you now.
6704776	6705456	Do you play DDR?
6706097	6712621	Well, since there's been tournaments and stuff, and some new people want me to come back again, I guess I'll play again.
6714402	6720986	Well, even though the DDR scene is dying in a way, because there hasn't been any releases for the arcades and stuff, which is totally understandable.
6722805	6728766	It's just the new people, the community, the new members are just trying to get, bring it back again in a way.
6729207	6731827	You give me $100,000, I'll bring back DDR.
6732247	6732948	I'm telling you.
6733048	6736568	The only way that you can bring back DDR is by fixing the Stamina cabinet, damn it.
6737069	6737729	Fuck that cabinet.
6738149	6738329	Give me $100,000.
6738369	6740229	Hell, give me just $20,000 and I'll bring it back.
6743427	6749950	Don't you think that, now, call me crazy, because it's not supposed to be DDR, quote-unquote, but don't you think In The Groove was sort of a way to try to bring DDR back?
6750530	6760234	That's what I always got the impression of, was that In The Groove was, even though it's not DDR... Well, the thing about In The Groove is that not many cabinets have been sold around the U.S.
6760294	6760775	just yet.
6761875	6763336	And very few songs are in it.
6763356	6766757	It's mainly just testing the waters until In The Groove 2 comes out and stuff.
6768258	6773020	And it also depends on what step makers are they going to hire and what songs they're going to put in it.
6775799	6779942	Hell, they put Ultramix, like, Ultramix in the DDR cam and I play it.
6781443	6784745	I already, the first week after Ultramix 2 is out, I put the call out on the show.
6784785	6788688	I said, we need to hound the shit out of Konami of Hawaii and however it has to happen.
6788808	6792971	I don't care if some arcade division went under or what the shit happened.
6793311	6794672	I don't care how it has to happen.
6794832	6795753	It just needs to happen.
6796033	6797454	Hawaii needs to make a new arcade mix.
6797854	6798394	End of story.
6798815	6801476	I don't care who's gotta be blown, who's gotta be paid the money.
6801997	6802797	Make it happen!
6803418	6805019	You know what's hella funny, though?
6805666	6816952	The hell of companies are saying that the whole arcade business is dying unless you're trying to do this card system like Tekken 5 and Midnight Tuner or Initial D. Yeah, but the lines for Tekken 5?
6817112	6817532	Insane.
6818072	6818432	Honestly.
6818772	6826536	You can't say Tekken 5 is not... I mean, despite how you feel about the Tekken series, it's, you know, the biggest crowd I've seen in an arcade in a long time.
6826596	6827377	I have my card.
6829678	6834380	You know, that's just like people saying, oh, well, you know, internet's killing the telephones.
6835560	6838062	People still use the telephones just like people use the internet.
6838482	6841185	Yes, people still use the telephone and I talk to them.
6841465	6841745	Sorry.
6842125	6848611	Anyways, but the whole thing is to convert, you know, Ultramix to an arcade system is like fucking easy.
6849091	6851293	Minimal programming, licensing of songs.
6852314	6853054	Build the hardware.
6853215	6854576	Hardware is fucking easy to build.
6854636	6856057	I mean, come on.
6856157	6856958	It's just an excuse.
6857058	6858839	But it's just they don't want to do it.
6859420	6860420	Because they don't want to distribute it.
6860541	6861041	And that's a bitch.
6861323	6865736	The reason why I pump it up is like making more and more money just building new machines and stuff
6868012	6875754	Allow me to be the first to offer sex to anyone at Konami of Hawaii if you can make yourselves a new DDR game.
6876215	6877435	You know what?
6878115	6879856	Not the Konami of Japan does a bad job.
6879896	6883057	So if they want to do a new mix, I'm perfectly fine with that as well.
6883517	6888638	I will extend my sex offer to Konami of Tokyo as well, K-Set.
6889179	6891619	So just make me a new DDR and I will put out.
6891739	6892340	It's that simple.
6893120	6896561	Anybody else care to offer their sexual favors?
6898636	6900618	Thanks for watching!
6920435	6923017	Because it's cheaper to license the songs of Japan, obviously.
6923037	6929803	It's gonna look a little weird, but like, I made this machine over here in Japan, it's called a DDR Extreme USA.
6931364	6940532	But it's not meant to be played in the United States, just... They could call it DDR Shit Mix, and I'd still play it.
6941233	6942194	I'm sorry, Shitake.
6943094	6946237	They could call it DDR Shitake Mix, I would still play it.
6946257	6947118	Shitake, that song.
6950422	6953263	Angel, you still play DDR at all?
6953683	6956885	You're probably more into DDR than anyone I know right now, so I have to ask you this.
6958026	6958686	Oh, yeah.
6958866	6965389	In fact, I'm probably going to break down and get a dual-platform ignition because I want to play on Xbox Live.
6966010	6966170	So...
6967563	6974126	Yeah, I'm looking into getting both of those this week, Ultramix 2 and the new pad.
6974866	6978548	Because Magus is dying anyway, so I might as well just replace it.
6979288	6980629	Then we can play doubles and stuff.
6981009	6984411	Speaking of ignition, which is better, ignition or cobalt flux?
6985952	6987952	I couldn't tell you because I haven't really played enough cobalt flux.
6987992	6991274	I saw it a little bit at E3, but I wasn't familiar enough with it.
6991783	6993384	They're both the same fucking pad.
6993764	6995664	It's the same damn thing with a different logo on it.
6995704	6996304	That's all it is.
6996705	6997725	You can't get much different.
6998025	7000046	Oh, our medal is different than your medal.
7000866	7004447	What about the quality and how many times could it be stepped?
7005387	7006268	It doesn't matter.
7006308	7007428	They're the fucking same.
7008288	7011510	Let's call a pledge that not even a rhino could beat down the pad.
7011810	7012091	Oh yeah!
7012611	7014192	Do they have a rhino to test this?
7014392	7017894	Did they take it to Africa and go, Hey rhino, step on the pad!
7018114	7018915	How do you like it?
7019415	7021697	I mean, I'm sorry, but I can say, yeah, guess what?
7021877	7023798	Jupiter has nothing on this pad!
7024419	7026060	This pad can fuck up Jupiter!
7027421	7030162	Seriously, they're just pulling the shit out of their ass, okay?
7030242	7031824	A rhino can't fuck this up!
7032004	7032644	Oh, well, guess what?
7032684	7035166	Bigfoot recommends, you know, red octane, so...
7035726	7036126	Fuck that.
7037787	7038348	It's stupid.
7038548	7042411	Really, to be honest, when it comes down to pads, don't buy off the internet.
7043011	7044372	Buy stuff that you can see in a store.
7044392	7046934	Buy it like fries and stuff where you can actually see these pads.
7046954	7054919	Because the shit you get off the internet, because I have bought metal pads off the internet, and I stepped on them and they bent.
7055659	7056700	They bent downwards.
7057201	7058441	And I was like, what the fuck?
7059542	7060283	It was retarded.
7061003	7063645	Pads are not meant to be folded in half.
7064417	7068499	Wow, talk about how they say SUVs can bust them on their advertisements.
7068959	7078983	Uh, our chat room over at www.orangeloungeradio.com, clicking on chat, uh, interesting point, there already is a DDR shit mix, and it's the Don't Fall Off mix, the DDR Extreme bootleg.
7079423	7080484	You know the one that would speed up?
7080664	7081464	Well, actually, there's two of them.
7081484	7082524	Yeah, I know about the speed up.
7082644	7084905	The one that'll speed up, DDR Extreme Plus, thank you.
7085025	7091328	There's the DDR, yeah, the one in Country Club Lane, speed up, ooh, let's speed up Max 300 and let's see if we can beat it at 360 BPM.
7091348	7091508	Oh, wow.
7094851	7097674	or hear cartoon heroes in a very high-pitched voice.
7112430	7114152	What is the deal with Cartoon Heroes?
7114572	7121597	Why do so many people freaking love that song and are quick to label a mix as utter shit if that song isn't in it?
7122097	7123739	I don't understand what is so great about the song.
7123839	7124499	Is it a good song?
7124779	7125660	Yeah, it's a great song.
7125680	7126861	It was a little better when Aqua did it.
7127161	7128022	But it's a good song.
7128522	7129363	Is it fun to play?
7130003	7130584	Kinda.
7130724	7132165	I mean, I'll die when I play it.
7132605	7136428	But why do so many people freaking obsess over Cartoon Heroes?
7136668	7139910	Like, do you know how many people threw a fit when that song wasn't in Extreme USA?
7139930	7140551	I can answer that.
7142125	7149667	Let's look back in DDR history and view what we call the songs that ruin mixes.
7150207	7153428	Starting with third mix, Afronova.
7153948	7159089	Who could love this wonderful African chant as you jump around like a complete nut?
7159889	7165391	Fourth mix, Kick the Can, with its repetitive steps over and over and over again.
7166171	7167631	There's another contributing factor.
7168611	7167631	1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 0, 7.
7173238	7180545	You're forgetting though, my edit to Kick the Can, aka Big Cans, was awesome and made that song redeemable.
7182307	7185550	Okay, and as I would continue on to the fifth mix, Hot Limits.
7186070	7189834	The song that just, you don't understand what they're saying, but you know it's very long.
7192995	7195637	Anyways, DDR Max.
7195837	7199359	I'd say probably that would be Exotic Ethnic.
7199599	7201601	It was pretty repetitive in DDR Max.
7201961	7203041	Oh no, Flash in the Night.
7203242	7204682	Yeah, that was another one.
7204763	7208445	Flash in the Night.
7208585	7210246	Hold on, your mic's still cutting out a little bit.
7210266	7212007	Hold it at the bottom.
7213868	7214249	A little bit.
7214309	7214809	Hold it at the bottom.
7215925	7216665	Yeah, try it, try it.
7216905	7217526	Put it close to your mouth.
7217546	7217866	There you go.
7218006	7224208	That's the same reason why it's Cartoon Heroes got whored out, the same reason why So Deep is getting whored off with, like, DDR Max.
7224468	7225468	Because it's like Hard As Hell 9.
7226648	7232510	I would say, I would say the song that ruined DDR Max, even though I love this song, Cowgirl.
7233471	7234171	Cowgirl, yes.
7235051	7243294	Max 2, Cigaroo, and who could not forget the song that had everyone dancing, Blow My Whistle, Bitch.
7244529	7245249	Oh, God.
7245429	7249350	Blow My Whistle Bitch definitely ruined Max 2.
7249430	7251451	Okay, so, make your point, please.
7252351	7254111	My point is, I don't have a point.
7254171	7261333	The point is that there's always going to be a song that people, that's catchy, and is annoying catchy.
7261873	7267354	And to be honest, I hate cartoon heroes, and I know there's 50 bands out there that all sound like them.
7267554	7270495	In fact, I hear different artists and I'm like, is that, you know, Aqua?
7270855	7271875	No, it's not Aqua.
7271975	7275436	It's Toybox or it's, you know, insert band here.
7275796	7276816	You know, Captain Jack.
7276936	7278996	I mean, they sound all the fucking same.
7279156	7281797	They have like the same singer that sings super high pitch.
7284657	7289238	I think that it's a man who's been, you know... I think she's on smack.
7289478	7290459	That's what's going on.
7290479	7291159	She's on helium.
7292539	7293779	She's fucking taking speed.
7293799	7294359	She's on crack.
7294680	7295340	Crystal meth.
7296540	7296880	She's just
7297645	7298045	It's awful.
7298125	7301107	Okay, so anyways, yeah, there's always going to be that annoying song.
7302828	7303169	That's all.
7304069	7308832	Yeah, there's always an annoying song that's annoying as well.
7308852	7310093	What the shit is this?
7312054	7317718	It's annoying when it was originally... Have you seen the video for this?
7317958	7320039	The video for this is fucking annoying, okay?
7320579	7321820	Honestly, it's just like...
7323447	7333516	You're confusing the original, there was no video to that, but you're confusing the original Aqua song, which is a little, it's a little bit slower, even though it sounds very similar, it's a little bit slower.
7334136	7343945	Pretty much, okay, take the original Cartoon Heroes by Aqua and play it on DDR Extreme Plus with the plus 20% modifier and that's what you get.
7343965	7345806	It's awful.
7346167	7346567	It's awful.
7346987	7347488	It's awful.
7348402	7353327	Anyways, yeah, they should have Extreme++, which, like, you know, speeds it up by 100% or something like that.
7354568	7355809	100%, okay, max 600.
7357311	7359693	Anyways.
7360013	7361114	1, 2, 3, 4, max 300.
7361154	7366139	Then we have songs that ruin the remix scene, but we'll do that another day.
7367641	7367881	Anyway.
7368101	7368442	Oh, no.
7369565	7376609	Speaking of songs that ruin DDR, I wanted to have an old school flashback and start it off with an old favorite song of mine.
7377110	7377850	Love this song.
7378110	7381973	Jamie was dying to hear some second mix songs that are actually good songs, so we're going to put those in.
7382353	7383253	So we're going to play those songs.
7383493	7386115	But we have to start it off with a song I've been threatening all night long.
7386155	7389257	It is the most old school of old school DDR songs.
7389837	7395821	Please take a minute, despite how you feel about this song, this one goes out to the one and only...
7397233	7400256	God bless his soul, he's not listening to us right now because he's out there.
7401096	7401657	Kyle Snyder.
7402317	7404599	God bless Kyle Snyder, seriously.
7405040	7411545	But honestly, this, despite how you feel about this song, respect for a moment, please.
7412106	7413487	We'll be back here on Orange Lodge Radio.
7414788	7418031	Ay-yi-yi, ay-yi-yi, ay-yi-yi.
7548271	7549591	Thanks for watching!
7611121	7618008	Boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob.
7634395	7653214	Y-I-I-I-I, you keep a focus through the green, green door I love you boy, it's your time You're very hard, you look like a young fella Take me overnight Boom, boom, boom, boom, something like a boom, boom Boom, boom, boom, boom, back to the water
7664298	7665181	Thank you for watching!
7770322	7775948	Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song, Orange Lounge Radio.
7780292	7784176	We are back, hi, on Orange Lounge Radio.
7784256	7785397	We are such nerds.
7785437	7788019	I was sitting there chatting on my DS with everyone else during the break.
7788039	7791303	We have four DSs in this house right now.
7791363	7793565	I think that we have five, but I'm not breaking mine out.
7795470	7795790	I know.
7795830	7796390	Yeah, that's right.
7796410	7797811	You got your DS here too, Jamie.
7797831	7799011	We could just have a DS chat.
7799231	7801052	I was trying to put some pictures there on the webcam.
7801312	7804994	I wrote penis, really dark, so you guys could see it, and then put it in the chat room.
7805014	7806154	Who's calling me during the show?
7807855	7808835	These people should know better.
7810116	7811176	Especially this person.
7811776	7812136	Shame.
7814097	7816198	Alright.
7817418	7824621	I'm just waiting for the emulator to work with Bluetooth, and then we'll get a wireless router so we can upload them all to a streaming chat room.
7825782	7826582	That's the dream.
7829723	7836405	And, oh god, for the person who requested Butterfly Pikachu Mix in the chat, no!
7837066	7837406	Heck no.
7837446	7838426	Although I do have that.
7838506	7838966	I do have that.
7839006	7839807	No, I'm not going to fire them.
7841947	7844428	Alright, who wants to hear who won the cage match tonight?
7846869	7850290	The winning song of tonight's cage match actually surprised me a little bit.
7850690	7852951	It only won by two votes.
7853894	7855235	Not one vote, but two votes.
7855295	7856876	It all came down to two votes.
7857336	7858817	The winning song of tonight's cage match.
7864820	7867242	Believe it or not, it won.
7867642	7868442	I'm actually surprised.
7868483	7869823	I thought Monolithic had it sealed.
7869883	7873285	Because she said it was going to be retired and they won another retired one.
7873505	7874586	That's basically it.
7874606	7878328	So Gwen Stefani is officially retired.
7878388	7880269	It'll spend one more week in the spotlight.
7880610	7882911	And then three brand new songs for you to listen to next week.
7885507	7885808	What?
7886488	7887449	As is her career.
7890312	7890712	Alright.
7890732	7903004	I was going to take another call over Skype, but I know that our chatters are kind of shy and probably wouldn't want to call in, so how about we get into the FUs of the week?
7903064	7907328	I think now's a good time, especially after that victory, to get into the FUs of the week.
7907348	7908750	Does that sound like a plan for you, Jamie?
7910605	7916130	Alright, and why is it, Miss Jamie, that we have to do the FUs of the Week every single week on this show?
7916470	7917892	Because everything sucks.
7925099	7926040	Oh, this is bad.
7935529	7940010	Big F you goes toward the stinky person on the plane who cut a big fart sitting in front of me.
7943091	7954095	Another F you goes toward just general backwards ass shit, having no free time, and my weird grammatical errors, and the four bottles of Guinness I had last night, and that's really about it.
7956315	7956756	That's it?
7957996	7958196	Yeah.
7960140	7969685	I want a big F you to my mom for saying that her chronic bronchitis is not aggravated by cigarette smoke.
7972447	7973307	Alright, you sure you're done?
7974468	7974808	Are you sure?
7975068	7975229	Yep.
7975469	7975809	You sure?
7976389	7976549	Yes.
7976950	7977250	Alright.
7978270	7978851	Alright, here we go.
7978871	7979451	Loki, your turn.
7982372	7984314	Fuck you, Folsom, on multiple occasions.
7985174	7988377	Number one being, um, the lights.
7988537	7992040	Literally, the lights, the stoplights around here are so short.
7992540	7993801	I came to a stoplight.
7994021	8004530	I saw it turn from green to red to yellow, um, you know, all the colors and everything in less than a second.
8004550	8006331	I was like, what the fuck?
8006591	8009233	There was not even enough time for one car to go through the light.
8010474	8011095	It was ridiculous.
8012799	8018986	Then, then, um, fuck you too, um, a giant marathon is out front of our fucking house!
8019286	8020248	Giant marathon!
8020348	8021629	Ah, shut up, you don't live around here.
8021970	8022470	Doesn't matter.
8023031	8030079	Um, you didn't have to hear at five in the fucking morning, wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-
8030319	8033360	broadcasted over a giant loudspeaker out front.
8033540	8039001	It was bad enough that they took up four of our parking spaces up close to our apartment with goddamn porta-potties.
8039321	8040602	Four porta-potties, okay?
8040962	8042462	Four porta-potties.
8042742	8045603	Meanwhile, there's 50 porta-potties along the street.
8045963	8049984	Why do you need four more strategically placed in those parking spaces?
8050384	8052165	Along with some stupid food, okay?
8052885	8056766	Now, I'm no genius here, but since the fucking, you know, damn road is closed...
8057447	8064416	I'd say there's a pretty good chance you can probably put that booth right there next to all the goddamn fucking porta-potties.
8065017	8067500	Wow, wouldn't that make sense?
8068101	8071486	But no, so we have to make noise for three hours.
8072167	8073489	Three hours in the morning.
8074628	8085092	See, I was expecting not to hear the marathon, because last time I slept through it, but, you know, I got woken up, and my first, you know, things that came to my mind was, this is fucking ridiculous.
8085892	8093494	And we went outside, and there's tons of runners, and trust me, if I'm outside... KCRA3 is protecting you with our live pinpoint doppler radar.
8093794	8096836	I don't fucking care about your pinpoint doppler radar!
8098136	8100537	I was trying to find a link to the chatroom...
8101789	8103650	I was trying to find a link about the marathon.
8103670	8110292	There was a story on a local news station I was going to send it to the... That's actually kind of funny now that I think about it.
8110372	8110632	F.U.
8110652	8111212	Channel 3.
8114433	8118735	So anyway, yeah, that really sucks.
8120015	8124217	Other than that, a premature... Oh, man.
8124297	8126758	A premature fuck you to...
8128581	8130882	My car that has to go in on Thursday.
8132363	8138365	And it's going to suck because I know they're going to try to screw me out of my fucking warranty.
8139105	8141807	But, you know, I won't let them because I know it's not my brakes.
8142167	8144007	It's their fucking calipers that are broken.
8145208	8147729	But I have to take off work on Tuesday to go to my grandma's funeral.
8148289	8152851	And I have to take off work on, or I mean Tuesday for funeral, Thursday for my car.
8153511	8154872	So it's going to be kind of a weird week.
8156473	8157013	But, uh...
8157472	8158853	Yeah, I'm going to call in sick on Thursday.
8158873	8159534	I'm not going to tell them.
8161335	8166420	And finally, just fucking retarded people that play Final Fantasy XI.
8166560	8169602	I've never seen more unintelligent people in my entire life.
8169923	8172265	People that misspell something and then misspell.
8172565	8173346	Like, for instance...
8173846	8180612	Please help me out, spell P-L-I first, and then they're all, oh, I'm sorry, I misspelled that.
8180832	8182213	P-L-I-S.
8182433	8182834	Please.
8183174	8183534	Pliss.
8183934	8184815	Pliss help me out.
8185276	8187037	Welcome to Ragnarok, chat.
8187097	8187658	My god.
8188318	8190019	I would say Pliss learn how to spell.
8192001	8194503	Anyways, I just hate people and their bad grammar.
8194583	8198947	I mean, honestly, I can understand shorthand, you know, using R and U as actual words.
8199372	8199632	I don't know.
8199652	8199812	I'm done.
8225769	8228270	F you to that marathon that was going on outside the house this morning.
8228510	8232112	Seriously, you can go to any Sacramento-based website and read about this marathon.
8232152	8233433	It's a huge event that happens every year.
8234093	8236834	I think that's great if you want to do a marathon and what have you.
8237154	8240076	But freaking shut up or start the thing after...
8240936	8246137	You know, there's a noise ordinance in the city that says do not make noise until after 8 a.m.
8246557	8249438	So, freaking turn your loudspeakers off until 8 a.m.
8249638	8251099	Or, you know, it doesn't make sense to me.
8251319	8255160	We live right behind a huge lake that is emptiness.
8255460	8256680	There's nothing at the lake.
8257520	8259321	Nobody goes to the lake in the wintertime.
8259801	8263602	Start the marathon just like 300 feet away at the lake, okay?
8264262	8266603	Honestly, it's a marathon.
8266643	8267623	They can run a little further.
8268757	8272580	But Rob, it's 9-11, and, you know, terrorists.
8273681	8275182	But here's the thing I don't understand, okay?
8275262	8282348	I can understand, okay, I would have not had a problem if the guy is just like, you know, okay, we're going to start the race at da-da-da-da time, you know, this kind of thing.
8282708	8286191	And then at the time, you know, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, go, you know, like he did.
8286451	8289253	But no, he had the, and the, blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah.
8289413	8291175	He just talked for three hours straight.
8291195	8291715	Okay?
8291835	8301342	It's like, you know, I understand you have, you know, the PA and stuff to, you know, get a hold of, you know, attention of these people, but you don't need to fucking talk, like, all the time!
8301903	8310409	Just say, okay, well, you know, announce, you know, 15 minutes before the race starts, you know, so you can get in your marks, you know, and then do the countdown, and that's it!
8310610	8313072	Oh, and then there's a fucking siren after that!
8313272	8313352	Woo!
8315513	8319136	Like, cause you didn't, you didn't see, oh, why are all those people running?
8320077	8322779	One more thing I forgot to add, sorry, I'm stealing your thing.
8323179	8326062	Fuck you, the police department here, because they were parked...
8326638	8327999	No, I get this F you, okay?
8328259	8338606	I get the F you to the police department because frickin' I called them at 6.30 in the morning saying, there is a marathon going on outside this house, I'm sure you're aware, but they are being way too loud.
8338786	8341748	And she's like, sorry sir, there's nothing I can do about that.
8342469	8346411	I said, are you aware that there's a city ordinance that says that you can't make noise before 8 a.m.?
8346912	8350414	If you have an issue with that, you're going to have to call City Hall and request to the permits department.
8350714	8355539	So now I'm going to have to look like a big grinchy asshole when the fact of the matter is I'm probably not even going to live here next year.
8355780	8357462	But I am not going to let this shit slide.
8357602	8363388	I am pissed that they woke me up at 6.30 on a freaking Sunday when I was out drinking the night before.
8364049	8364249	Ass!
8365611	8366552	Sorry, Loki, you had a thought.
8368069	8384576	My thought was because this police officer parked his car in the middle of the fucking lane, on the street, no reason, just sitting there with his flashers on, not blocking traffic because there was an accident, or he pulled someone over, or he was fiddling around with god knows what, he was parked in the middle of the fucking road!
8385216	8385997	For no reason!
8387337	8388057	So I went around him.
8389498	8390178	On the inside.
8391159	8394200	Except if there was a dead person there, I would have run him over.
8396066	8419217	to be continued I am going to call and complain on Monday just you wait and I know the neighbors upstairs I'm proud of you I am taking lessons from Jamie I'm going to have her proofread my angry letter I'll do it too I'll make that stuff fit in it awesome you should sign it even though you don't live here alright let's go around and get some other folks in studio get their FUs of the week we'll start off with Angel um
8420956	8426561	Yeah, just F you to, uh, yeah, I don't know.
8426741	8427041	Shit.
8428102	8429303	I actually don't really have one.
8429643	8431625	Uh, F you to my instructor because he's mad.
8432245	8436749	But, uh, he's actually letting us out on the 8th or something like that.
8437610	8441132	But, uh, we still gotta come back to the finals, so I don't know what's up with that.
8442333	8442694	I don't know.
8442734	8443054	Whatever.
8444915	8446116	Arcadian42, your FUs of the week.
8450629	8452570	Alright, make sure, you hear me, can you?
8452850	8453510	I can hear you.
8453771	8454051	Okay.
8454831	8465956	Uh, fuck you to my skin, I don't know about the winter, it just makes my skin start getting all dry, and I just drink lots of water, but it still doesn't help.
8466757	8467537	But, uh, anyway.
8468358	8479163	Uh, yeah, and, uh, Loki was talking about, uh, stupid, uh, traffic lights, there's one near my work that's stupid, that's, like, misprogrammed, that's, like,
8479662	8484585	Changes in 5 seconds, after like 5 seconds from green to yellow.
8484705	8490769	And some, like recently, they fucked up the timing so that this crossroad isn't getting all that much traffic.
8490809	8494912	It's like, you sit there for a minute before it goes back to green.
8495032	8496233	That's annoying.
8497054	8499115	Uh, and, uh, yeah.
8499215	8504739	I get a laziness and so it's still hurting me from playing DDR or something.
8505699	8506200	Laziness.
8506340	8506900	Yeah, whatever.
8507930	8508270	All right.
8509011	8509612	Explicit.
8510412	8513535	And just so you know, I told the chat room they have to keep it short, so you do too.
8514176	8517398	Yeah, the FU's already announced what the marathon is.
8517539	8518940	Well, yeah, the marathon's, of course.
8519160	8521522	Waking people, waking me up early in the morning.
8522123	8524325	The fact that it got me 30 minutes late to work.
8525726	8534874	And speaking of the marathon, I want to give an FU to some... I want to give an FU to some little, some teenager...
8535683	8540264	I have something to say about that but I'll wait till later.
8540344	8541984	Oh, you can say it now.
8563866	8566306	Everybody knows that girls and gays have no place in DDR.
8567847	8569287	I was not going to say that by just saying.
8569387	8574528	You know, two-thirds of this show is comprised of girls and gays, so I would watch a little mouth there.
8575688	8578109	I mean, I'm just saying, it's just DDR.
8578549	8580189	There's nothing special about it.
8580209	8585250	Some people take it way too seriously in the forums.
8588631	8589251	Alright, is that it?
8592226	8595027	Well, FU2, upcoming finals coming up soon.
8595668	8601771	FU2 for not being able to spend money for freaking Christmas because I have to spend some money on bills and stuff.
8603671	8604632	And that's about it for now.
8605080	8606540	All right, let's get to the chatroom FUs.
8606560	8608441	They're mad at me because I told them they had to keep it short tonight.
8608461	8608901	They don't like that.
8608921	8611362	But seriously, we've got like 20 people that send FUs in tonight.
8611402	8611762	It's a lot.
8611782	8613002	We need to go ahead and read one, though.
8613102	8615123	Yes, Jamie has one she wants to read first.
8615343	8619705	Because I'm actually on AAM right now, and I'm not telling anybody what name I'm on.
8621185	8624246	It's a FU from Vogue Obscurity.
8626026	8630948	A big FU to our roommate M for eating all of our food and not buying anything and shipping ramps.
8630988	8631628	Good sushi, Mike.
8633409	8633709	All right.
8635648	8639714	Dark Knight would like to give a gigantic FU to me getting sick and working at the same time.
8639794	8640875	Somebody shoot me please.
8640976	8644280	And one more FU for my dumbness when I took my placement test during the week.
8644661	8646323	Talk about brain farts, man.
8647383	8653168	Sigurd says, first FU goes to the show for not talking about drawn together nearly enough.
8653308	8653648	Screw you.
8654308	8657691	FU to Illusion for turning down offers of sex for his vote.
8658151	8662034	And FU to Hot Topic for not having any drawn together shirts, even though they don't exist yet.
8662335	8663275	You know, think about it this way.
8663776	8671222	If Illusion had changed his vote from Gwen to Monolithic, then it would have been a tie, and Jamie probably would have went with Monolithic when she broke the tie.
8671662	8673343	So, just think about that one.
8675125	8675625	No, I wouldn't have.
8676880	8677681	Oh, okay, well, hey.
8678862	8684467	Flareon A says, F you to Nintendo for not allowing Game Boy and Game Boy Color games to be played on the DS.
8684967	8685628	What the fuck?
8686569	8690712	This just goes along with Nintendo's method of getting you to buy the same thing 50 million times.
8691933	8696517	MPQ says, F you to Microsoft for not letting me install Japanese IME.
8696617	8697678	I'm having that same problem, too.
8698139	8702162	F you to Suncoast for ripping me off and charging me... What?
8702242	8702402	What?
8702482	8702983	Explicit what?
8705580	8708641	You have to download a different patch, not the Global IME from Microsoft.
8708821	8709621	Oh, maybe that's what's going on.
8709762	8709942	All right.
8709962	8713323	Yeah, don't rely on the Global IME for that.
8713483	8717824	F you to Suncoast for ripping me off and charging me $30 a disc for Azumanga Daioh.
8717904	8718605	I hope I said that right.
8719025	8720365	F you to the Ty... What?
8720385	8720805	What was that?
8721426	8722786	You said it right, Azumanga Daioh.
8722926	8724087	Hey, I pronounced something right.
8724107	8725447	What do you know?
8725527	8728668	F you to the Tyco Drumsticks for being uncomfortable and hurting my hands.
8729569	8732310	F you to people who call it singles and doubles on DDR.
8732430	8733110	It's not tennis.
8734474	8737035	Lastly, fuck everyone who has access to 2DX.
8738576	8742258	It's been singles and doubles since the first one.
8742718	8747361	I think it might be the way in which you say it.
8749142	8751383	I think I might get what it is.
8751443	8752843	I think I get the tennis comparison.
8754364	8757126	Did I get the fuck everyone who has access to 2DX?
8757306	8757606	I don't know.
8758046	8759187	Those are from MPQ.
8760067	8763449	Poto says, F you to World of Warcraft, eating up every second of my life.
8765814	8777528	Jaded2004 says F you to everyone who hates SmileDK Rychan says F you to myself for being emotionally stupid last night F you to egos killing the gaming star Hey, didn't I say that one?
8778188	8784356	F you to tomorrow not being Thursday Aw, big hug Rychan, big hug Blarg says F you to
8786121	8787082	Egalitarians?
8788062	8788943	Egalitarians.
8790144	8790884	Egalitarians.
8790965	8791765	I can pronounce words.
8791825	8792926	I just have to sound it out in my mind.
8793346	8796188	Misty says, first and foremost, F you to the cage match.
8796648	8799250	Secondly, F you to chicken tenders and French toast sticks.
8799511	8803193	Because I think I'm just pissed about that because I was working those parts of the kitchen at the time.
8805575	8805795	Oops.
8806175	8807276	I hope I didn't close a new window.
8808037	8809257	I hope I didn't miss somebody's F you.
8809317	8809858	Sorry if I did.
8810358	8814881	Snowcat says, F you to having a birthday in December and to people who think it's better to combine presents.
8815041	8815562	Bastards.
8816616	8820117	DJ Ranma S says, Giant FU to my job for cutting my hours again.
8820157	8820897	You bastards!
8821298	8822298	I gotta eat too, you know.
8822658	8825099	Another FU to the retard tech that I work with.
8825119	8826119	You are a fucking tool.
8826479	8829740	I swear, if you did get a job through Affirmative Action, I'm putting in my two weeks.
8830841	8831681	FU short version.
8832401	8833481	Oh, well, I read the long version.
8834142	8834362	Sorry.
8835342	8837763	Legend of Zaku says, F you to not having a girlfriend.
8838243	8845925	F you to all the drama that I have to put up with in the DDR Freak New York forums, thus resulting in the locking of the forums for a short time and the near split that was about to happen.
8846285	8849546	And F you to the Chinese language for being so fucking hard to speak and write.
8852587	8854427	I could say something about the New York forum thing.
8855988	8856448	No comment.
8857168	8860509	Okay, I'll comment because I have no status on Freak, so it's fine for me to comment.
8860929	8860989	Um...
8862398	8864619	You guys need to learn how to respect authority!
8865319	8872202	No, I'm not saying you in particular, but, I mean, it seems like when somebody says, don't do this, like, a million people want to do it, and then you wonder why people get angry!
8874263	8874523	Anyway.
8875303	8876364	Films off the internet.
8877644	8877884	Anyway.
8880225	8881766	I'm gonna get shit for that, but I don't care.
8882246	8884587	DarkTetsuya says, a continued FU to Comcast.
8884607	8888909	I recently got to see the nuclear train wreck that is the new screensavers.
8889409	8891310	I can tell the show's going down the toilet.
8892887	8894448	Oh my god, Rob, you said nuclear.
8896668	8897168	That's a joke.
8898489	8905531	F you to Xbox Live on Ultramix 2 being so glitchy that we had to start the tournament over five times because it kept quitting and being glitchy.
8905991	8912193	F you to the douchebags in my English class that don't have the brain capacity to talk about anything other than sports for more than five seconds at a time.
8912413	8914714	And F you to Sigurd for cheating on me.
8914834	8915574	Man, what a whore.
8916775	8917115	Oh my.
8921172	8927974	VxJasonXV, who says I should just call him Jason, but I don't, says F you to data entry, it makes us lazy people cry.
8928394	8935096	Funny that I call myself lazy, although I'm writing a program to parse data for me automatically instead of taking less time to just do it myself.
8936537	8937697	And F you to irony.
8940578	8942079	And that's going to do it for the F yous of the week.
8942759	8943719	Thanks for playing, boys and girls.
8943839	8944339	Yes, Loki.
8945400	8946020	One last one.
8946160	8948941	Fuck you, KFC, for getting rid of your sweet and sour sauce.
8952506	8954668	Why would KFC get rid of sweet and sour sauce?
8954748	8956169	Did PETA make them do that or something?
8957049	8958570	They just got rid of their sweet and sour sauce!
8958791	8965956	I got, uh, popcorn chicken, like, last week from there, and I was like, okay, I want some sweet- extra sweet and sour sauce, and I was like, oh, we don't have sweet and sour sauce.
8966516	8966716	What?!
8967657	8968698	What is this craziness?!
8969959	8970439	I don't get it!
8970519	8971039	What the hell?
8971200	8973541	Why- why would you- that was, like, the best sauce they had!
8973821	8974662	Now they have ranch!
8975503	8976003	Woo!
8976163	8976624	Ranch!
8977204	8978525	Ranch and mustard!
8978965	8979826	Honey mustard!
8981496	8983018	I want my fucking sweet and sour sauce.
8983078	8983899	It's like classic.
8984199	8985661	McDonald's has their sweet and sour sauce.
8985861	8988004	Fuck, I eat the sweet and sour sauce by itself.
8988445	8992209	I mean, I don't understand why you can't just give me the nice sweet and sour sauce you had.
8993070	8994132	I'd buy up the reserves.
8994853	8995133	I would.
8995153	8996415	Anyways.
8996435	8996655	Anyways.
8998629	9000150	I think it's time to go to our break, boys and girls.
9000210	9005773	When we come back from this break, I think we'll do a little bit of Ask Orange Lounge and we'll open up the Skype line again for those of you guys who want to get through and comment.
9006173	9006514	Excuse me.
9006954	9011556	So send in your questions for Ask Orange Lounge over private message to Sky in the chat room right now.
9012397	9014338	In this break, I think we'll do some songs from 2DX.
9014818	9015999	Just some 2DX potpourri.
9016279	9016539	Enjoy.
9016559	9016539	... ... ...
9114042	9114763	Thanks for watching!
9158351	9159312	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
9293968	9294810	Thanks for watching!
9374813	9376055	Orange Lounge Radio.
9376395	9378558	We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.
9384645	9386988	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
9387448	9388870	Our chat room has gone crazy.
9389010	9393395	I was making some jokes during the break there, and now everybody's talking about my pants.
9394696	9397738	And I feel bad because there's a guy in there that really just needs a hug right now.
9398058	9402960	And the talk about my pants and my name in various Bomani games is eclipsing that conversation.
9403040	9404581	So, I feel bad.
9406260	9409201	Anyway, back to the dick and fart jokes we were talking about here on Orange Lounge Radio.
9409301	9409721	No, seriously.
9409801	9412742	Actually, I wanted to bring something up that Explosive was talking about during his FUs of the Week.
9413802	9418743	I felt kind of bad for this guy over on The Freak who had posted something in the NorCal forums.
9418763	9420484	Are there any other gay people that play DDR?
9421044	9426205	And people just kind of, like, jumped down this guy's throat going, It doesn't matter!
9427585	9428766	Why are you posting this shit?
9428786	9429346	It shouldn't matter!
9429406	9429886	And you know what?
9430643	9431304	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
9448283	9449363	I don't mind that.
9449383	9450544	I don't mind that.
9470012	9470552	Oh, God.
9470572	9472153	More pants chat.
9472193	9473114	Thank you very much.
9475975	9476375	No, it doesn't.
9476615	9484379	But I kind of feel bad for the guy because when you are gay, sometimes it is hard to meet people in the same way that straight people kind of meet each other.
9484679	9487801	And especially if you're the kind of person that's had an upbringing where you've had to be very
9488221	9489182	Hey girl, you wanna go out with me?
9512875	9516159	But seriously, man, just, if you're gay, just talk to people, man.
9516199	9518221	It doesn't matter if you're gay or not.
9518261	9537659	But I just think, now, where I think the guy may have made a mistake is maybe DDR Freak just isn't, maybe the place, people want to talk DDR and DDR Freak, they don't want to talk about, you know, but I think he was just looking for gay people who are into DDR, so I PM'd him some links, because there's actually a live general community that's like gay DDR players, there's gay gamers, get it, gamers communities and stuff like that, so.
9537759	9543724	Well, yeah, it's okay to post on the NorCal and stuff, but I mean, you see that all the time in DJR chit-chat and stuff and general discussion.
9544644	9546626	Like, you see, like, hundreds of topics like that, and...
9547156	9548356	Now, yeah, and I agree.
9548436	9556659	Now, it's almost, almost, it's very similar to the girls that play DDR topic, because for whatever reason, now, there's a difference, though.
9556679	9557439	There's a difference.
9558019	9561721	When it's a guy posting, are there any girls that play DDR?
9563241	9563921	That's one thing.
9564021	9565222	Yeah, exactly.
9565282	9570143	That's just, you know, somebody who's sitting there downloading Violent Hypergirls freestyle videos.
9571924	9573304	Love you, Aaron.
9573504	9573964	Love you, Aaron.
9574865	9575345	And, uh...
9577304	9580006	But when it's a girl posting, are there other girls that play DDR?
9580026	9586570	Well, then, you know, you're just kind of like, okay, well, maybe, you know, it's kind of too bad that there aren't a lot of girls that, you know, go out to the arcade.
9586670	9588071	But I think DDR has been bringing more.
9588111	9590252	I think there's been more and more, but just in the past.
9590272	9590913	There's more and more now.
9590933	9595015	There's more and more now, but especially when I first started playing, there wasn't a whole lot that I would see at the arcades.
9595075	9599238	Back in the days before DDR, when I would play pinball, I maybe once or twice saw a girl at the arcade.
9599278	9602120	I only saw one girl back then, but now I see, like, a bunch of girls.
9602760	9606763	Well, I'm not sure if it's because of the FU tournament I helped organize in Sacramento or...
9607904	9611087	or just the whole tournament issues nowadays that people want to get involved with.
9611587	9615590	When I see girls posting that on the DDR Freak forums, I think, Ooh, lesbians!
9617131	9618072	That's what I think.
9619253	9619753	Freak.
9619913	9621354	Little girl, girl on girl mix.
9622615	9625858	Jamie, do you have anything you want to add to this horrible discussion?
9626943	9627863	Your pants are hot.
9628103	9628543	Shhh.
9629304	9629724	Shove it.
9631964	9633124	I know this is very late.
9633384	9634425	It's another FU.
9634905	9637525	FU to splitting my pants open this morning.
9637825	9638826	That sucks.
9639626	9644287	I was reaching for something and all of a sudden I hear this rip and there was my crotch exposed.
9644787	9645667	Oh, speaking of rip.
9645727	9646667	You know what that means, right?
9646947	9649068	You're fat.
9649188	9649828	Know what it means?
9649848	9653069	It's that I was laying on my pants and trying to stretch at the same time.
9653189	9654889	It does not mean I'm fat, you dumbass.
9657466	9657846	What is it?
9659248	9660208	Do you have something you want to say?
9660288	9661930	No, I'm not going to comment on Loki on that one.
9661950	9663191	Well then fine, you're fat too.
9664072	9665333	Loki, don't look fat.
9666814	9667935	I just showed you my thugs, don't look fat.
9667955	9669436	You're going to make me straight, God.
9669737	9671999	Alright, you know there's a camera right there.
9672019	9674941	Oh, look at my thugs.
9675041	9683288	Okay, sorry if it scares people for that.
9683669	9684709	I'm changing the subject.
9689178	9695962	Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?
9696443	9714874	One thing we won't find out because he already said But Loki split his pants today, therefore he must be fat You know, the butcher's knife is still clean It's one of the only dishes that's not dirty yet
9717716	9719577	Seegard has a question starting it off.
9719617	9720697	This will make you feel better, Loki.
9721337	9723778	Who is your favorite drawn together character and why?
9727299	9729219	Mine is Xander for obvious reasons.
9730200	9732580	Mine is Nolan because I have a life and don't watch TV.
9733261	9735201	Oh my god, that's such a tough question.
9735561	9735721	Oh man.
9739838	9741259	I would have to say Ling Ling.
9741559	9745461	I love Ling Ling and just how funny and Japanese it is.
9745921	9749062	And just like, it's more of like two characters.
9749962	9752183	It's Spanky and Ling Ling.
9752223	9754324	They're interactive, you know, interactions.
9754544	9755765	That's the best part, you know.
9756705	9762308	But Ling Ling's hilarious and... Are you looking forward to Christmas?
9764945	9766487	Well, too bad there's no singles!
9767950	9769372	But see, it was Xander who said that.
9771635	9773438	I would say my second favorite, though, would be Foxy Love.
9774199	9775081	I love Foxy Love.
9775722	9776082	Bleh.
9776944	9777404	Bleh.
9778486	9778847	Anyway.
9781425	9782807	Next question from MPQ.
9783228	9785851	How many people care about the song Cartoon Heroes?
9785891	9790116	It seems to me that people actually want the steps rather than the song.
9790557	9795223	Do you think it would work if they took the steps and then put them on a 170 beat per minute Konami original or something?
9796337	9800659	That's the one thing I can kind of see about Cartoon Heroes, why so many people want that song.
9800719	9802040	Is it the steps?
9802160	9803040	Okay, that's fine.
9804081	9806022	And I don't think it would work on any other song.
9806042	9807163	I mean, it would just be weird.
9812245	9814406	But see, you're cutting out a little bit.
9814446	9818348	He's saying something about the fact that if it was a 7-footer, not as many people would play it.
9818528	9819468	I somewhat disagree.
9819528	9823010	I think there's people that play it because they play Speed Over Beethoven as well.
9823150	9824170	You know, that whole type of thing.
9824550	9829532	Or we could say if the song was... Yeah, if it goes 140 BPM, then no one would play it at all.
9834639	9837861	Think of the songs that are over here instead of BPM being overplayed.
9837881	9838721	This is my thing.
9839021	9842523	And this is the same thing when people ask, why aren't there enough 10-footers in DDR?
9843123	9845324	Can you really play 10-footers on a homepad?
9845444	9847686	I mean, if you can and you're passing them, good for you.
9847746	9848966	But you are in a minority.
9849206	9850927	Let's face it, you are in the minority.
9852088	9853929	If you can pass those kinds of songs on a homepad.
9854949	9857470	Do you think all songs must be 10-footer?
9857710	9858251	Oh, let's go.
9859952	9860872	Every freaking song.
9861592	9862633	That's why you can make edits.
9863911	9864811	if you don't like the steps.
9865772	9866572	Simple question.
9866972	9872013	Or just play in the groove and just hammer the machine so much so your feet dies and shit.
9872053	9875734	Okay, if there's one thing I'm not doing at home, it's hand plants.
9876014	9876495	End of story.
9877515	9878575	No fucking comment.
9878595	9879715	Hand plants are so, like, 98.
9879916	9883797	Hand plants are so ancient civilization.
9884477	9886517	We don't go around kung, kung, kung.
9890619	9891859	You don't need any more time to fight rape.
9898041	9898481	Dark Knight.
9899361	9902602	Everyone must be at the computer or on the webcam because all I see is Bradley.
9902622	9902962	You're right.
9903522	9909484	Our webcam kind of needs a new angle, I think, because obviously a lot of us kind of hide back here.
9909644	9910685	He needs a spotlight.
9910905	9912885	Yeah, we're angels kind of hiding back here.
9912945	9918447	She's sitting on the ground next to Loki and I. And I see that Angel has candy, so I'm going to steal something.
9918487	9919768	What the hell are you thinking?
9920268	9920668	Wait, what?
9920868	9921908	No, it's in the forums.
9921988	9922749	It's Matrix Walk.
9922769	9922989	Oh, my God.
9923029	9923309	Oh, my God.
9924893	9929598	I don't want to bring up another FU, I just... Fucking Natalie Portman for not getting naked.
9931019	9931699	I fucking hate that.
9931940	9934202	You don't go see a movie... Okay, it's a fucking chick flick.
9934921	9945526	Now, granted, there are some very funny scenes in there, like the whole, um, uh, what was it, internet, um, like, net porn type thing sequence that they had to classical music.
9945566	9946386	Now, that was funny.
9946906	9949027	I grant, that was the best part in the whole movie.
9949567	9952189	But, Natalie Portman was not fucking naked!
9952529	9954670	They advertised this movie as her being naked!
9954890	9955850	And she was not naked!
9956250	9956631	Why?
9956831	9957631	Why, why?
9959552	9962193	So, she falls in the same category now as the Olsen twins.
9962593	9964314	Whereas, she needs to do porn.
9966159	9970041	I have the perfect answer and you will agree with me.
9970061	9970401	Iron Chef America.
9970421	9970541	Oh God!
9994798	9996600	No, we need more real Iron Chef.
9996660	9998162	Iron Chef needs to come back on the air.
9998482	9999203	The original.
10000424	10000785	Damn it.
10001045	10002787	We need Michiba to come out of retirement.
10003127	10004929	And kick all their asses.
10005109	10006010	I absolutely agree.
10006130	10006911	Iron Chef America.
10007672	10009614	Bobby Flay is a fucking faggot.
10009774	10010215	I hate him.
10012219	10015221	I was gonna say, I was gonna say, don't insult faggots, please
10033290	10036931	Legend of Zaku says, okay, my 2DX skills are what some would say subpar.
10037351	10044092	How does one make the conversion from single-handed seven-key play to double-handed play so that when I go out to play 2DX again, I don't end up sucking?
10045492	10051913	I think training mode on the home versions is really good, but you said you don't have training mode, so you're kind of screwed, buddy.
10051953	10052554	I hate to say it.
10053254	10055554	Honestly, you're just going to have to practice, practice, practice.
10056074	10057134	Arcadian, you play a lot of 2DX.
10057154	10060995	Do you have any advice you could give to our buddy Zaku, if we can hear you on that mic?
10061721	10062261	Yeah, practice.
10062302	10063743	That's the only thing you really do.
10063943	10065324	There really is nothing else you can do.
10065364	10066085	There's no trick.
10066345	10068847	There's no wrist exercise or anything you can do.
10069027	10069908	You've just got to practice.
10070428	10072510	Play as many different songs and different levels as you can.
10072530	10072690	Exactly.
10072750	10074752	Play songs you don't usually play.
10075172	10080897	Every time you go to play 2DX, make your last song something you've never played before that's about the same skill level, same star level.
10081077	10082218	That's the only way you're going to get better.
10082238	10083539	Play things that are harder than you can do.
10083639	10087803	I played the Anothers and everything when I first started out.
10088383	10090445	Even though I couldn't even get near close to passing, I just...
10091092	10101940	See them and try them out Sooner or later you can pass this part of your stuff Alright, let's move on Blarg says, who would you rather have sex with?
10103341	10120714	God An 80 year old in an 8 year old's body Or an 8 year old in an 80 year old's body That's the point where I go to Goldies You know, actually I don't have to worry about it Yeah, you wouldn't have sex with a lady anyway
10122459	10124860	Unless it was Margaret Cho, I don't know.
10125020	10126020	I would with Margaret Cho.
10127360	10131641	Would you rather have sex with an 8-year-old in an 80-year-old's body or an 80-year-old in an 8-year-old's body?
10133581	10134141	Margaret Cho.
10135501	10142563	Well... I'd choose D. This is totally the Loki side of me.
10144343	10148904	But if the 80-year-old was inside the 8-year-old's body, she'd be experienced and tight, so...
10155475	10156456	No, but you have to understand.
10156476	10159818	You have to understand the logistics of it, okay?
10162099	10170085	Would you rather play ball in a field that has short grass or a field that's just like turned to dust, okay?
10170105	10173647	I mean, you're going to have an unexperienced old chick.
10173667	10174568	That's just nasty.
10174628	10175388	I mean, I'm sorry.
10176269	10177610	But, if you think about it,
10178857	10184099	Not only are you robbing the cradle, but you're fucking getting some older action at the same time.
10184339	10186119	So it's like, it's wrong.
10187060	10188220	Topic change, real quick.
10188260	10189961	DJ Ranma S says, my question.
10190401	10196743	As I was rudely interrupted earlier tonight, I missed half the show, but I could have sworn I heard Oduro Ponpokolin.
10197303	10199624	Did I really hear that, and where can I find that song?
10199664	10204885	Yes, you did hear Oduro Ponpokolin, and it is actually the version, let me play a little clip of that for you guys.
10204905	10206406	Oduro Ponpokolin
10208234	10209154	Yes, you did hear that.
10209895	10211435	And DDR Festival.
10211935	10213816	DDR Festival is one of the songs in there.
10213876	10216877	So pick up the Festival soundtrack, I guess, if there is one.
10217037	10217897	I don't think there is one yet.
10219238	10220158	Or you can message Loki.
10220178	10221878	He'll let you know where to find it.
10223599	10225200	You have to find out DDR UK.
10225220	10227800	It's very hard to find, though.
10227840	10228961	Ranma S also says Sky.
10230049	10232350	Similar stuff happens in the cosplay community.
10232410	10233911	Points to my post in the chat.
10235232	10235692	I missed it.
10235833	10236453	I'm sorry, buddy.
10236473	10238334	You gotta send it over private message or I might miss it.
10240095	10240355	Alright.
10246214	10247995	What do you guys think about SongPack 7?
10248455	10249256	Worth buying?
10251557	10254278	Yes, because I think you should support DDR, and it's just five bucks.
10254338	10257000	I mean, that's like, you know, lunch at Burger King.
10257040	10257620	It's not that bad.
10257900	10263763	And the new remix is pretty kickass, and then you can play Era against me online, and Era's a good song.
10263923	10268386	If you honestly are just not into the remix, we played it for you guys later tonight.
10268426	10270587	If you're just not feeling the I Feel remix...
10271567	10300127	Then I guess maybe there isn't a whole lot for you to gain from this But I would say, you know what, buy it and just support DDR Because the more people that buy songpacks Yeah, this is what you get for coming late There's a new I Feel remix There's another FU, FU for being late Alright Okay, let's see Illusion says Jesus came to me and said he loved me so I kissed him I would like to ask your opinion if that was too forward
10305202	10307343	Now, does that make him gay or Jesus gay?
10309483	10310664	Well, maybe it was Jesus.
10311004	10313204	I mean, you know, maybe it wasn't the Jesus.
10313264	10314925	Maybe it was some guy named Jesus, you know?
10317206	10321027	And if he returned back to Earth, I think we have more things to worry about than your kiss.
10325168	10329829	You know, I think Jesus would have just said, thank you, and then ran away.
10333999	10336861	Yeah, he would forgive you for being a dirty homo sinner.
10342384	10349248	You would have inevitably undone humanity because Jesus would then go to hell for being gay and a sinner.
10349708	10355412	And yeah, Earth would end and humanity would go away.
10359094	10359354	Anyways.
10361328	10363009	Well, we don't have any more questions from our chat.
10363129	10364350	Oh, no, I think we just got another one.
10364370	10369733	But I am going to open up the Skype line here over on www.orangehunterradio.com.
10369753	10370633	Click on Interact With Us.
10372134	10373035	DarkSakura says...
10374051	10382153	I've been trying to dig up info on KR, Konami version, the Karaoke Revolution Konami version, but I only saw the small snippet on Konami's site.
10382513	10383793	Is that all the info that's out there?
10384474	10390215	Yes, I have only been hearing about this secondhand, kind of, through Navi, the Poppin' Music Whore.
10390595	10391755	He's been kind of following this.
10392456	10393676	From what I understand...
10395063	10397883	There is going to be a Karaoke Revolution Bomani version.
10398024	10399224	Not in the US, okay?
10399324	10400324	It's a Japanese mix.
10401684	10405645	And I guess it's just going to be something that is happening.
10405785	10408865	We don't know a whole lot about that, but there was questionnaires that happened already.
10409385	10412166	And folks could fill out those questionnaires.
10412986	10414146	But that's all we know right now.
10414366	10418347	So there's nothing else we know that's going on with the Bomani edition as far as I know.
10419207	10422148	It's all about Naha Naha Gachakun battle.
10423008	10424328	That needs to be on there in duet mode.
10431578	10432718	I'm eating gummy bears right now.
10432778	10437520	The fun thing you can do about these, you can bite them in half and lick one end of it and stick it to stuff.
10437580	10439001	And it will stick there for a long time.
10439341	10446323	And if you stick it to someone's back window and they don't notice it, when they try to peel it off, it's all slimy because of all the moist air outside.
10446463	10447443	It's really fun to do.
10449504	10451505	So bite a gummy bear in half, stick it to your friend.
10453906	10454826	How is that for random?
10457009	10457389	Wow.
10458830	10459470	Very interesting.
10461470	10464251	I guess it's time to start wrapping up this show, you guys.
10464271	10469092	The show's just about... Oh, oh, oh.
10469532	10470733	Angel reminded me of something.
10471613	10472353	Not so subtly.
10472693	10473853	Okay, this is something I wanted to bring.
10473893	10476314	I wanted to bring this up in the first hour of the show, and I totally forgot.
10476674	10478614	Angel went and got a Happy Meal at McDonald's today.
10481555	10484516	There's no shame in a Happy Meal at the Happy Meals.
10486078	10488745	I saw Sonic and I'm like, hmm, maybe it's a figurine.
10489502	10490202	Yeah, exactly.
10490262	10491463	It's a Sonic Happy Meal.
10491523	10494885	I guess they teamed up with Sonic the Hedgehog to do these Sonic Happy Meals at McDonald's right now.
10495165	10495485	Look at this.
10495805	10498387	She got a free little game with hers.
10498647	10500908	Like, these are the kind of games like Mr. Game & Watch.
10500928	10501729	Tiger Toys!
10501849	10502689	Yeah, the Tiger Toys.
10502709	10503210	You remember these?
10503530	10505531	These used to be the things we would get for Christmas.
10505611	10509093	These shitty little, like, watch games that we would get for Christmas as a kid.
10509813	10512935	And now they're coming in freaking Happy Meals, and it's a little Sonic one.
10513235	10516337	And it's basically a ghetto version of the bonus stage from Sonic 2.
10517437	10519318	My God, this is a Happy Meal toy.
10519679	10526963	I remember when we used to get shitty little wind-up toys and little plushy things and fucking Beanie Babies with Happy Meals.
10527403	10529765	And now we get freaking video games with Sonic.
10530065	10532066	And when did Sonic start making a comeback in the U.S.?
10532086	10532946	That's the other thing.
10533847	10534908	I guess I've just been asleep.
10534928	10535348	Yeah, that's right.
10535388	10536148	He's got the cartoon.
10536449	10537529	Okay, so I've just been asleep.
10537569	10537949	That's fine.
10538410	10541411	I mean, Sonic's cool and all, so I'm glad that they're doing the Happy Meal thing.
10541451	10543533	But, man, you get a freaking...
10544253	10544593	Game?
10544633	10549376	Like, this is the kind of stuff we would open up on Christmas Day and be excited about, and now you get it in a freaking Happy Meal.
10549396	10549916	What's up with that?
10556259	10558200	Is there something you wanted to add to that, Jamie?
10558240	10558960	You're a Sonic fan.
10559000	10559721	Is this cool?
10559741	10560801	No, I just like to thread.
10561802	10561902	Oh.
10565183	10569245	I understand how cool the free iPods are, but don't start a thread about it!
10570406	10570986	God, people...
10574531	10575692	They're giving them away for free.
10575912	10578835	Does that tell you anything about how crappy they are?
10579776	10580336	They're free!
10580676	10581757	They can toss them away!
10583779	10584059	Sad.
10585020	10585761	I love my iPod.
10585801	10586381	You shut your mouth.
10588363	10589724	We gotta wrap up the show, boys and girls.
10591286	10592967	Next week on the show, more randomness.
10595329	10597611	In two weeks, I'm gonna be going to AI, Arcade Infinity.
10597631	10598532	I'm making an LA trip.
10598592	10599072	I'm hoping!
10600003	10605765	I may not get to go for sure, but that's kind of what I'm trying to do is go to Arcade Infinity probably next Thursday.
10605825	10607245	Not this coming Thursday, but next Thursday.
10607285	10608906	So I hope to see some of you guys there.
10609966	10610607	Our stalker fans.
10610627	10611087	That'll be fun.
10611807	10617049	And my goal is to get a whole bunch of EMUs cards and get them way on the show to those less fortunate who can't get them.
10617589	10619229	So we'll see what happens with that.
10620710	10623311	Anyway, next week on the show, more of the same stuff.
10623351	10625351	I'm going to try and line up an interview for next week's show.
10625372	10626752	I want to interview somebody again.
10627128	10629289	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
10654588	10660652	I mean, this week's going to be a crazy week, and my work's not going to be too happy with me taking off another day on Thursday, but... What the hell with them?
10661313	10661513	Oh!
10662274	10663835	Actually, the... Ah, fuck, that sucks!
10664255	10666056	I'm supposed to get my check on Tuesday.
10666837	10667437	Oh, well, I'll have to wait.
10668317	10670419	We get our bonuses next week, so that's kind of cool.
10671420	10677964	But I have to buy gifts, and I think Nelly wants diamonds again, and, you know... Fucking women and their expensive gifts.
10679945	10682747	Anyways... Yeah, that's all.
10684526	10685066	Nick!
10686908	10687668	Angel, your final thought.
10688528	10690350	Brock's Candy Company needs to be sued.
10691350	10691630	For?
10692291	10693591	Making these things damn good.
10693972	10694272	God.
10695973	10697714	Maple nut goodies.
10697754	10698454	They're really good.
10698674	10699275	They're very good.
10699295	10700395	I've been snacking on it all night.
10701976	10702957	Arcadia, your final thought.
10703157	10703577	Can you hear me?
10704057	10704217	Yes.
10704297	10704958	Oh, okay.
10705038	10707899	I only had one piece of sushi last night.
10707980	10708540	I need more!
10709318	10711360	More sushi!
10711640	10715844	I don't think Anita's listening anymore, but you need to go bang down her door.
10715864	10717066	I don't really need her.
10717886	10720749	Unless she wants to make some more, that'd be cool.
10721270	10722050	Sushi from somewhere.
10722171	10723152	Sushi's wonderful.
10723672	10725914	We need, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie!
10725974	10726395	Sushi night.
10728476	10729077	Yes, oh my god.
10729097	10731098	You're off Atkins now, so we need a sushi night.
10731438	10732099	Or sushi lunch.
10732899	10733139	Maybe.
10733459	10734340	Sushi lunch would be better.
10734360	10736401	Because I'm still not eating sugars at night.
10736501	10738322	I'm teaching, so it may be difficult.
10738522	10738943	Weekend.
10739623	10740444	Oh, yeah, I think that works.
10740464	10740824	That'd be cool.
10740984	10741364	One more thought.
10741464	10742245	One more thought.
10743325	10744426	I was thinking the other day.
10745507	10747788	This is very important, so everyone pay attention.
10750410	10753291	We haven't done a QZAR night in a while.
10754252	10755032	We need to do one again.
10757174	10757474	So I'll
10758174	10761555	Check on the forums, or not the forums, but check on LiveJournal.
10763116	10766657	There will be a new QZernite, and we will reign supreme again!
10766677	10768397	Alright, I'm done.
10770758	10771678	Explicit, your final thought.
10772899	10780821	Well, if I wanted to get to work early, I should have just ran every fucking marathon runner over, GTA style.
10784272	10784532	All right.
10785852	10788233	My final thought is thanks for listening.
10788413	10793014	And tune in to our spinoff shows, damn you, because we need more people to listen to that because they're cool.
10793754	10796074	And we're almost to the end of the year.
10796114	10800415	There might be big changes coming to Orange Lounge Radio in 2005, which reminds me, we need to have a staff meeting.
10800455	10802536	I know we don't ever have staff meetings, but we need to have a staff meeting.
10803136	10805576	Maybe that can be the sushi lunch, even though Loki doesn't eat sushi.
10805916	10807157	We can go to a multiple place.
10807957	10808157	What?
10808417	10810077	We can go to a place that has teriyaki, too.
10810097	10810657	Yeah, we'll do that.
10811518	10812438	We need to have a staff meeting.
10812678	10813318	Staff meeting.
10814852	10815792	DarkSakura, your final thought.
10817593	10818793	I hate my allergies.
10820373	10821954	I hate your allergies too.
10821994	10825055	My allergies hit you back, so yeah.
10825075	10825455	Okay, cool.
10826455	10826755	Alright.
10827675	10829156	Final word of the show tonight.
10829756	10830736	I'll give to Angel, why not?
10833057	10833957	Damn it, Brox.
10834357	10834977	Yeah, that's it.
10837191	10842054	That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.
10842875	10847077	Orange Lounge Radio Live is an Orange Lounge Radio production.

11013563	11018745	Bruce Springsteen isn't Jewish, but my mother thinks he is.
11019946	11022767	Tell the world of Hanukkah.
11022907	11025708	It's time to celebrate Hanukkah.
11025928	11027649	It's not for now.
11027669	11030951	Shanukkah, the sea is silent in Hanukkah.
