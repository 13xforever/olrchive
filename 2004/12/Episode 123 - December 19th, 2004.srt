[SPEAKER_22]: Orange Lounge may contain plenty of... Just kidding.

12
00:04:09,871 --> 00:04:13,592
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that in this episode.

13
00:04:13,692 --> 00:04:15,093
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, isn't that special?

[SPEAKER_05]: And this is episode number 123 for this December the 19th of 2004.

17
00:04:56,833 --> 00:05:01,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Believe it or not, making this the last show before Christmas, if you can believe it or not.

18
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:04,018
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Rob Roberts.

19
00:05:04,138 --> 00:05:05,119
[SPEAKER_05]: You might know me as Sky.

20
00:05:05,159 --> 00:05:07,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts.

21
00:05:07,521 --> 00:05:10,343
[SPEAKER_05]: In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Jamie Summers.

22
00:05:10,363 --> 00:05:11,604
[SPEAKER_05]: You know her better, DarkSakura.

23
00:05:11,664 --> 00:05:13,726
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm still bleeding out of my thumb.

24
00:05:14,086 --> 00:05:14,887
[SPEAKER_05]: You're bleeding?

25
00:05:15,367 --> 00:05:16,128
[SPEAKER_11]: Out of my thumb.

26
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:19,392
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be an ER edition tonight.

27
00:05:21,834 --> 00:05:24,597
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh my god, get the antibiotics!

28
00:05:24,677 --> 00:05:28,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you ever seen that real emergency trauma show, but the one with pets?

29
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:30,883
[SPEAKER_15]: Do I ever watch TV?

30
00:05:31,544 --> 00:05:32,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I figured you might watch that.

31
00:05:32,805 --> 00:05:35,187
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have time for Iron Chef, you have time for this.

32
00:05:35,207 --> 00:05:37,990
[SPEAKER_15]: I download my Iron Chef, and I'm pissed off about Supernova.

33
00:05:40,524 --> 00:05:43,787
[SPEAKER_05]: We're all a little pissed off about Supernova, but I have the answer.

34
00:05:44,668 --> 00:05:46,349
[SPEAKER_05]: When we get back, we'll talk about that a little bit.

35
00:05:46,789 --> 00:05:50,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Also joining us tonight, Tech Massa, Loki!

36
00:05:51,373 --> 00:05:51,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Not!

37
00:05:52,994 --> 00:05:58,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki is at a holiday gathering tonight for his family, so he may come in a little bit later, but...

38
00:05:59,366 --> 00:06:00,726
[SPEAKER_05]: We all know he may not be here.

39
00:06:00,786 --> 00:06:03,147
[SPEAKER_05]: He's got no pressure to come back at any particular time.

40
00:06:03,767 --> 00:06:10,169
[SPEAKER_05]: You remember when Loki used to be here every single night for like two years, religiously?

41
00:06:10,869 --> 00:06:12,169
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean every single night.

42
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:14,670
[SPEAKER_15]: He was here for the second episode and I wasn't.

43
00:06:17,551 --> 00:06:18,211
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember that.

44
00:06:18,271 --> 00:06:18,631
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

45
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:24,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Also joining us tonight, we do have a special guest able to fill in for the absence of a third co-host.

46
00:06:24,452 --> 00:06:25,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Say hello to DDR Angel.

47
00:06:27,062 --> 00:06:29,622
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello, I will not be as angsty as him, I'm sorry.

48
00:06:30,503 --> 00:06:31,123
[SPEAKER_05]: That's alright.

49
00:06:31,403 --> 00:06:33,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe for once, this is what it is.

50
00:06:33,783 --> 00:06:37,104
[SPEAKER_05]: You're listening to the kindler, gentler Orange Songs Radio.

51
00:06:37,784 --> 00:06:39,104
[SPEAKER_05]: The Holiday Cheery Edition.

52
00:06:39,204 --> 00:06:40,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh wait, Jamie's still here, never mind.

53
00:06:40,724 --> 00:06:41,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck you!

54
00:06:43,285 --> 00:06:43,825
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

55
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:49,406
[SPEAKER_05]: This is gonna be weird, because tonight I'm outnumbered by women.

56
00:06:52,326 --> 00:06:53,927
[SPEAKER_13]: We're still gamers, so what's your point?

57
00:06:55,107 --> 00:06:56,247
[SPEAKER_00]: Girls play games?

58
00:06:57,689 --> 00:07:01,110
[SPEAKER_15]: I did nothing but play games for the past three days in a row, okay?

59
00:07:02,931 --> 00:07:04,791
[SPEAKER_15]: And it was all Phantasy Star Online.

60
00:07:04,951 --> 00:07:08,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is a good segue into how was your week, how was your day?

61
00:07:08,212 --> 00:07:08,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Ha ha ha.

62
00:07:09,432 --> 00:07:09,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

63
00:07:10,533 --> 00:07:20,695
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll get into that all a little bit more in a little bit, but first we're going to take a quick break featuring the mandatory song you know we have to play tonight, but we're only going to play it once this week, okay?

64
00:07:21,136 --> 00:07:25,977
[SPEAKER_05]: Because too many of you bitched last week, but because it is Christmas week here, we have to play it.

65
00:07:26,517 --> 00:07:27,217
[SPEAKER_05]: You already know.

66
00:07:27,237 --> 00:07:31,979
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't know what song I'm talking about, you obviously haven't been playing DDR very long.

67
00:07:31,999 --> 00:07:32,559
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's okay.

68
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:33,579
[SPEAKER_05]: We're here to help you.

69
00:07:33,939 --> 00:07:34,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Noob!

70
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:36,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

71
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
[SPEAKER_13]: Do I smell a noobie?

72
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,661
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be back after this.

73
00:07:39,701 --> 00:07:40,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, join our chatroom.

[SPEAKER_11]: Night is nightfall

77
00:10:46,057 --> 00:10:51,679
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys know what?

78
00:10:51,699 --> 00:10:54,200
[SPEAKER_05]: The chat room was demanding more Silent Hill.

79
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,220
[SPEAKER_05]: So, here you go.

80
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:11,918
and more.

81
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:08,810
Thanks for watching!

82
00:12:38,506 --> 00:12:41,308
It's got to be forever, the raindrops blowing, the wind is dancing

83
00:13:00,274 --> 00:13:09,980
[SPEAKER_11]: It would be a much better fight With you, with me If you hadn't let me I'd be fine on my own, baby Never felt so lonely Then you came along So now what?

84
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:30,181
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm strong out, addicted to you My body aches, now that you're gone My supplies fell through And you let me give me everything

85
00:13:39,582 --> 00:13:40,863
Thank you for watching!

86
00:14:14,213 --> 00:14:19,622
[SPEAKER_23]: Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song, Orange Lounge Radio.

87
00:14:20,444 --> 00:14:26,907
[SPEAKER_05]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 123 on your radio right now.

88
00:14:27,247 --> 00:14:30,768
[SPEAKER_05]: And I apologize to you guys if you're hearing a little bit of a buzz in the background tonight.

89
00:14:31,088 --> 00:14:35,750
[SPEAKER_05]: One of our cords, I think, is a little bit stripped, so we've got to get it replaced, and I think that stripping is causing the buzz.

90
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:39,231
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll look into getting that replaced before the new year.

91
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:42,653
[SPEAKER_05]: But for tonight, you're going to have to deal with it, so I apologize.

92
00:14:43,153 --> 00:14:45,654
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, so here we are.

93
00:14:46,394 --> 00:14:47,715
[SPEAKER_05]: Almost at the end of 2004.

94
00:14:48,395 --> 00:14:58,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Just when I was finally remembering to write 04 on my checks instead of 03, the damn year's almost over, and now I'm going to have to start writing 05, or I'm really going to be screwed.

95
00:14:58,599 --> 00:15:00,499
[SPEAKER_05]: So, what's first?

96
00:15:00,579 --> 00:15:01,840
[SPEAKER_05]: Presence, or how was your week?

97
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Presence!

98
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,240
[SPEAKER_05]: Presence first?

99
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,721
[SPEAKER_05]: You mean we're going to make an exception?

100
00:15:04,981 --> 00:15:05,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Presence!

101
00:15:05,461 --> 00:15:06,181
[SPEAKER_05]: The rule that we always do?

102
00:15:06,362 --> 00:15:07,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Presence!

103
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:07,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

104
00:15:08,662 --> 00:15:09,123
[SPEAKER_05]: Fair enough.

105
00:15:09,163 --> 00:15:11,704
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, presents are, you know... Okay, now...

106
00:15:13,126 --> 00:15:13,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know, Loki ran away.

107
00:15:13,967 --> 00:15:14,407
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll get him back.

108
00:15:15,528 --> 00:15:16,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki came home, by the way.

109
00:15:16,529 --> 00:15:21,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki came home during the break, so I don't know if he's going to be involved in this show tonight or if he's going to be kind of in and out or whatever.

110
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:27,239
[SPEAKER_05]: But he's here, and he's trying to get our webcam up and running as well over on OrangeLaunchRadio.com, so check that out.

111
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:30,703
[SPEAKER_15]: He says it's up and running.

112
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:31,944
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's not on the website yet.

113
00:15:31,984 --> 00:15:34,006
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got to turn on the switch on the website.

114
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:37,997
[SPEAKER_05]: Also joining us tonight, we have Arcadian42 came in during the break.

115
00:15:38,498 --> 00:15:39,820
[SPEAKER_05]: You know it's 6.30, buddy, right?

116
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,341
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm just kidding.

117
00:15:40,762 --> 00:15:41,804
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have a mic for Arcadian?

118
00:15:41,925 --> 00:15:42,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Was there another mic over there?

119
00:15:42,806 --> 00:15:43,808
[SPEAKER_14]: There should be another mic over there.

120
00:15:43,889 --> 00:15:44,309
[SPEAKER_05]: There should be.

121
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:44,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Somewhere.

122
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:46,560
[SPEAKER_05]: We get it?

123
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Under the rubble.

124
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:48,202
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

125
00:15:48,902 --> 00:15:54,387
[SPEAKER_05]: It's under the big Christmas present montage there we have all of Loki's presents.

126
00:15:54,747 --> 00:15:57,830
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, I'd just like to point out I have not started my shopping yet.

127
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:04,895
[SPEAKER_05]: So even though we are going to be doing a little bit of gifts tonight, it just makes Christmas last longer if I don't give my gifts until next week.

128
00:16:05,936 --> 00:16:06,737
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what you're calling it.

129
00:16:06,917 --> 00:16:11,421
[SPEAKER_05]: No, well, I'm not going to break my Christmas tradition of doing all my shopping on Christmas Eve.

130
00:16:11,801 --> 00:16:12,942
[SPEAKER_05]: So, sorry.

131
00:16:12,982 --> 00:16:13,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop the day after Christmas.

132
00:16:14,622 --> 00:16:15,083
[SPEAKER_05]: Or that.

133
00:16:15,123 --> 00:16:15,743
[SPEAKER_05]: That's even better, honestly.

134
00:16:15,783 --> 00:16:17,584
[SPEAKER_15]: That's why I've been telling everyone to get me gift cards.

135
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:19,625
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, gift cards are awesome.

136
00:16:20,345 --> 00:16:21,186
[SPEAKER_15]: So I can take advantage of them.

137
00:16:21,206 --> 00:16:22,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't I get you a gift card last year?

138
00:16:23,427 --> 00:16:24,667
[SPEAKER_15]: I think you did.

139
00:16:24,868 --> 00:16:27,709
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you're probably going to get another one this year because they're the easiest presents to buy.

140
00:16:27,729 --> 00:16:29,330
[SPEAKER_15]: And you know what?

141
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:31,091
[SPEAKER_15]: I went the day after Christmas.

142
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:31,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

143
00:16:31,951 --> 00:16:32,711
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a good gift to get.

144
00:16:32,912 --> 00:16:33,612
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, presents.

145
00:16:33,632 --> 00:16:35,113
[SPEAKER_05]: Then, Jamie, you better go first.

146
00:16:35,153 --> 00:16:36,373
[SPEAKER_05]: What's this first present you have here?

147
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:37,374
[SPEAKER_15]: This is something from Angel.

148
00:16:37,394 --> 00:16:38,734
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's like a couple of 40s.

149
00:16:39,095 --> 00:16:39,395
[SPEAKER_15]: It's about...

150
00:16:40,345 --> 00:16:41,686
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a bigger than a bread box.

151
00:16:43,728 --> 00:16:44,849
[SPEAKER_15]: Lengthwise, no.

152
00:16:44,889 --> 00:16:45,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the thing.

153
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:52,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie has to guess her present in 20 questions or less or we're going to smash it in front of everybody.

154
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:52,695
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

155
00:16:52,775 --> 00:16:53,836
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll guess after I open it.

156
00:16:55,137 --> 00:16:55,478
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

157
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:58,400
[SPEAKER_05]: It's beer.

158
00:16:59,881 --> 00:17:02,784
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, while Jamie is opening her gift,

159
00:17:03,769 --> 00:17:06,612
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a request from the chat room.

160
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:10,817
[SPEAKER_05]: At some point tonight... Oh, what'd you get, Jamie?

161
00:17:11,138 --> 00:17:13,340
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a Coco mug set with teddy bears on it.

162
00:17:13,801 --> 00:17:15,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Aw, hot Coco.

163
00:17:15,383 --> 00:17:15,963
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cute.

164
00:17:16,905 --> 00:17:17,565
[SPEAKER_05]: That's precious.

165
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:23,793
[SPEAKER_05]: And so Angel's standing there going, see, Jamie needs a little more cute once in a while.

166
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:26,278
[SPEAKER_15]: It's very cute.

167
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:27,218
[SPEAKER_15]: Ooh, Irish cream.

168
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:27,879
[SPEAKER_15]: It makes me happy.

169
00:17:27,899 --> 00:17:28,960
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, sorry about that.

170
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Our chat room over at Orangetownradio.com, clicking on chat.

171
00:17:31,862 --> 00:17:41,388
[SPEAKER_05]: They're requesting that at some point tonight, in his best Christmas voice, that Loki says, God bless us, everyone!

172
00:17:42,669 --> 00:17:44,130
[SPEAKER_05]: In his best Tiny Tim voice.

173
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,831
[SPEAKER_15]: That's when hell freezes over.

174
00:17:46,992 --> 00:17:48,172
[SPEAKER_05]: At some point tonight, Loki.

175
00:17:48,252 --> 00:17:49,473
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all they want for Christmas.

176
00:17:49,533 --> 00:17:50,274
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure you can do it.

177
00:17:51,087 --> 00:17:52,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, I'm going next.

178
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:55,188
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to open... Angel got me two things.

179
00:17:55,888 --> 00:17:57,128
[SPEAKER_05]: Which one should I open first, Angel?

180
00:17:58,888 --> 00:18:00,469
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I'm going to do this one.

181
00:18:01,469 --> 00:18:04,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Which happens to be the same size as the one that Jamie got me.

182
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:07,690
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to scream if it's the same thing I got you.

183
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:10,511
[SPEAKER_05]: Open Jamie's first.

184
00:18:10,731 --> 00:18:13,971
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can still give this to somebody while it's still wrapped, just in case, right Angel?

185
00:18:14,251 --> 00:18:14,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, here we go.

186
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I'm going to open Jamie's first at Angel's request.

187
00:18:16,752 --> 00:18:17,092
[SPEAKER_05]: Here we go.

188
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:17,652
[SPEAKER_05]: Ready?

189
00:18:20,807 --> 00:18:23,468
[SPEAKER_05]: It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas.

190
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:24,689
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope it's a severed head.

191
00:18:25,589 --> 00:18:27,210
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a little flat for a severed head.

192
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:28,590
[SPEAKER_25]: Maybe you put it in a blender.

193
00:18:29,891 --> 00:18:30,831
[SPEAKER_15]: Parade head.

194
00:18:31,251 --> 00:18:32,292
[SPEAKER_25]: You like tape, Jamie?

195
00:18:32,972 --> 00:18:35,813
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, I suck at gift wrapping, so bite me.

196
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:43,676
[SPEAKER_15]: This is the worst paper ever.

197
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, is this a Final Fantasy XI soundtrack?

198
00:18:48,462 --> 00:18:48,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it is.

199
00:18:49,122 --> 00:18:51,564
[SPEAKER_05]: What a cool... Oh, that's awesome.

200
00:18:52,105 --> 00:18:53,706
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you know I'm an addict and everything.

201
00:18:54,406 --> 00:18:55,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that the same thing you got, Angel?

202
00:18:59,350 --> 00:18:59,831
It is?

203
00:19:00,371 --> 00:19:03,373
[SPEAKER_15]: I have been looking at that for three months.

204
00:19:03,453 --> 00:19:05,835
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I knew three months ago that's what I was going to buy for you.

205
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:06,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, poor Angel.

206
00:19:07,697 --> 00:19:07,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you...

207
00:19:09,835 --> 00:19:13,937
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I'm easy to shop for, yet at the same time very difficult.

208
00:19:14,177 --> 00:19:14,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thank you both.

209
00:19:14,957 --> 00:19:16,137
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a very, very nice thing.

210
00:19:16,177 --> 00:19:16,798
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Jamie.

211
00:19:17,518 --> 00:19:19,559
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to be able to do something with that, right, Angel?

212
00:19:20,539 --> 00:19:20,819
Sure.

213
00:19:21,639 --> 00:19:22,280
[SPEAKER_05]: She says sure.

214
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,420
[SPEAKER_13]: He has no idea.

215
00:19:26,281 --> 00:19:26,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

216
00:19:26,941 --> 00:19:27,241
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

217
00:19:27,602 --> 00:19:29,342
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to open this.

218
00:19:30,723 --> 00:19:34,004
[SPEAKER_05]: A present from Angel, and it's in a, like, trapezoid-style box.

219
00:19:41,539 --> 00:19:43,140
[SPEAKER_05]: All I can see is limited guarantee.

220
00:19:45,181 --> 00:19:46,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I need that, don't I?

221
00:19:46,542 --> 00:19:48,123
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a Jenny Craig gift pack.

222
00:19:49,223 --> 00:19:50,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's a case for the DS.

223
00:19:50,664 --> 00:19:51,805
[SPEAKER_04]: Good, because I need one of those.

224
00:19:51,905 --> 00:19:52,445
[SPEAKER_05]: I really do.

225
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, because I travel so damn much.

226
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:58,569
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a traveling case for the DS.

227
00:20:00,114 --> 00:20:00,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, sure!

228
00:20:00,454 --> 00:20:02,075
[SPEAKER_05]: She was totally fucking with me

229
00:20:25,247 --> 00:20:28,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, I was just looking at this yesterday and I almost bought it.

230
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:30,291
[SPEAKER_05]: That is so funny.

231
00:20:31,212 --> 00:20:32,913
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Ping Pals for the DS.

232
00:20:33,293 --> 00:20:33,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.

233
00:20:34,374 --> 00:20:35,475
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a whole DS.

234
00:20:35,555 --> 00:20:37,597
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like a Pokemon-style game.

235
00:20:37,617 --> 00:20:38,377
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't figure it out.

236
00:20:38,477 --> 00:20:39,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Angel, what is this game about?

237
00:20:40,459 --> 00:20:46,663
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a mix between Pokemon and... What am I trying to say?

238
00:20:46,723 --> 00:20:47,644
[SPEAKER_13]: Tamagotchi, kind of.

239
00:20:51,567 --> 00:20:52,207
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool.

240
00:20:52,408 --> 00:20:54,049
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to check this out, so that's good.

241
00:20:54,069 --> 00:20:54,149
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay!

242
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:56,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you guys.

243
00:20:57,011 --> 00:20:58,413
[SPEAKER_05]: I love you guys.

244
00:20:58,493 --> 00:20:58,893
[SPEAKER_05]: Give a hug.

245
00:20:58,953 --> 00:20:59,314
[SPEAKER_05]: Angel hug.

246
00:21:00,035 --> 00:21:01,656
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though I have headphones on, so I can't really move.

247
00:21:01,937 --> 00:21:05,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Long distance hug.

248
00:21:05,701 --> 00:21:07,983
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you feel the love here on Orange Lounge Radio?

249
00:21:08,844 --> 00:21:09,325
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

250
00:21:09,505 --> 00:21:10,246
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so excited.

251
00:21:10,887 --> 00:21:12,689
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Final Fantasy XI music too.

252
00:21:12,749 --> 00:21:13,029
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so good.

253
00:21:14,085 --> 00:21:16,646
[SPEAKER_15]: I figured that that would be something you'd really dig.

254
00:21:16,946 --> 00:21:18,407
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, okay, Loki has seven in his present now.

255
00:21:18,487 --> 00:21:25,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, I just want to say, this is like my favorite artwork in all of Final Fantasy XI, by the way, is that world map that's drawn all artistic style.

256
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:26,250
[SPEAKER_05]: That's Amano.

257
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,891
[SPEAKER_05]: If I could get a huge poster of that.

258
00:21:27,991 --> 00:21:28,991
[SPEAKER_15]: That's Amano's art.

259
00:21:29,152 --> 00:21:29,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it?

260
00:21:30,052 --> 00:21:30,872
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so sexy.

261
00:21:30,912 --> 00:21:34,834
[SPEAKER_15]: He did all, because I used to use one of those wallpapers when I, for the short time I played.

262
00:21:36,721 --> 00:21:37,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Very sexy.

263
00:21:37,902 --> 00:21:40,004
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to put this up on the webcam.

264
00:21:40,244 --> 00:21:42,345
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll put all the presents up on the webcam at some point during the show.

265
00:21:42,365 --> 00:21:44,567
[SPEAKER_05]: www.orangelingerator.com Loki's turn.

266
00:21:45,468 --> 00:21:46,529
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, Loki, Loki.

267
00:21:46,729 --> 00:21:48,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki is opening a present from Jamie.

268
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:50,051
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a bitch to wrap.

269
00:22:02,241 --> 00:22:04,223
[SPEAKER_24]: It's a Grim Reaper slash toy.

270
00:22:06,286 --> 00:22:09,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Jamie has given Loki death for Christmas.

271
00:22:09,988 --> 00:22:10,788
[SPEAKER_05]: That's lovely.

272
00:22:10,849 --> 00:22:16,772
[SPEAKER_15]: I tried to get a cupcake to put with him so I could give you death cake, but I didn't have time.

273
00:22:16,852 --> 00:22:18,373
[SPEAKER_05]: That would have been killer.

274
00:22:19,793 --> 00:22:20,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.

275
00:22:21,894 --> 00:22:22,555
[SPEAKER_11]: Isn't he cute?

276
00:22:22,735 --> 00:22:24,316
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a happy little holiday.

277
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:27,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, and another one for Loki from Angel.

278
00:22:27,878 --> 00:22:28,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see what this is.

279
00:22:29,198 --> 00:22:30,639
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it another Iraqi suicide baby?

280
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

281
00:22:33,821 --> 00:22:34,021
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a

282
00:22:38,644 --> 00:22:40,665
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an amazing pooping reindeer.

283
00:22:40,745 --> 00:22:41,965
[SPEAKER_05]: That's lovely.

284
00:22:47,807 --> 00:22:50,668
[SPEAKER_05]: Nellie's infatuated with the pooping reindeer, apparently.

285
00:22:51,249 --> 00:22:52,329
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can eat the poop.

286
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:57,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you going to give Nellie the poop?

287
00:22:59,048 --> 00:23:02,351
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, she can have the poop.

288
00:23:02,671 --> 00:23:06,394
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to put this all on the webcam so you guys can see during the next break.

289
00:23:06,414 --> 00:23:06,874
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll get to it.

290
00:23:07,275 --> 00:23:11,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Or actually, I'll walk over there right now while Jamie... Don't give me Happy Jones Soda.

291
00:23:11,758 --> 00:23:12,719
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that all the gifts?

292
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:13,720
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

293
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there'll be more gifts next week.

294
00:23:16,122 --> 00:23:16,602
[SPEAKER_05]: I promise.

295
00:23:18,283 --> 00:23:21,426
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we're going to just find a way to get it to you anyway, DDR Angel.

296
00:23:21,966 --> 00:23:22,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, here we go.

297
00:23:23,567 --> 00:23:24,288
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a whole week.

298
00:23:24,788 --> 00:23:25,149
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

299
00:23:29,917 --> 00:23:31,579
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go back to how we start off every show.

300
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,724
[SPEAKER_05]: We got a little sidetracked, but presents are a good reason to sidetrack.

301
00:23:35,065 --> 00:23:36,146
[SPEAKER_15]: I like presents.

302
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:40,113
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to start off tonight's show playing a little bit of How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day?

303
00:23:41,434 --> 00:23:45,799
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, my week was all, I was just feeling really stressed out and crappy all week.

304
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,602
[SPEAKER_15]: I went to my last day of class on Monday.

305
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:51,706
[SPEAKER_15]: I found out that I made a B in my business law class.

306
00:23:52,667 --> 00:23:58,874
[SPEAKER_15]: I made a 390 out of 400 in my Excel class, so I have a very solid A in that class.

307
00:24:00,235 --> 00:24:06,358
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, yeah, I made like a hundred on my final and they, uh, full points on my final project too.

308
00:24:07,118 --> 00:24:09,199
[SPEAKER_15]: So, I'm all happy and excited about that.

309
00:24:09,219 --> 00:24:12,521
[SPEAKER_15]: That means I have like a 3.2 something GPA for the semester.

310
00:24:13,601 --> 00:24:13,681
[SPEAKER_15]: Um...

311
00:24:15,502 --> 00:24:19,225
[SPEAKER_15]: I paid 300 and something dollars for my next classes, which kind of sucked.

312
00:24:20,045 --> 00:24:24,349
[SPEAKER_15]: But I was really, really stressed out all week and really exhausted.

313
00:24:24,369 --> 00:24:27,331
[SPEAKER_15]: And then finally, Thursday, I just collapsed at work.

314
00:24:27,391 --> 00:24:30,873
[SPEAKER_15]: I was all, you know, totally lacking in energy.

315
00:24:31,073 --> 00:24:33,675
[SPEAKER_15]: And I ended up going home after half a day.

316
00:24:34,516 --> 00:24:37,038
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I tried, because I was just really sick.

317
00:24:37,802 --> 00:25:05,619
[SPEAKER_15]: and then I felt better the next day so I got up to go back to work and only managed to stay three hours before I had to come home again and I did nothing then but sleep and play Phantasy Star online for the past three days nothing but that so yeah, I'm back to playing PSO I'm not an addict because I don't really want to play anymore for some time I basically went, I made it to level 41 in three days

318
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:11,629
[SPEAKER_15]: We're trying to get me to Ultimate so I have 40 more levels to go.

319
00:25:15,367 --> 00:25:17,929
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, that's really all I did.

320
00:25:18,069 --> 00:25:21,992
[SPEAKER_15]: We went to this place called Crickets on Auburn yesterday.

321
00:25:22,752 --> 00:25:26,415
[SPEAKER_15]: That my friends were up and down was going to be like the best breakfast place ever.

322
00:25:27,636 --> 00:25:30,898
[SPEAKER_15]: And it was just ass.

323
00:25:31,118 --> 00:25:34,200
[SPEAKER_15]: My French toast was just egg and milk on bread.

324
00:25:35,461 --> 00:25:38,643
[SPEAKER_15]: And like I saw them put plates on top of full plates of food.

325
00:25:39,364 --> 00:25:40,384
[SPEAKER_15]: It was really disgusting.

326
00:25:41,745 --> 00:25:45,026
[SPEAKER_15]: And my potatoes were cold.

327
00:25:46,426 --> 00:25:48,886
[SPEAKER_15]: They were nice there, but it was just kind of crap.

328
00:25:48,946 --> 00:25:51,347
[SPEAKER_15]: So I wouldn't recommend anybody go there.

329
00:25:52,147 --> 00:25:53,547
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm not going there again.

330
00:25:54,127 --> 00:25:56,228
[SPEAKER_15]: But it made my day really grumpy yesterday.

331
00:25:57,008 --> 00:25:58,048
[SPEAKER_15]: I was really grumpy yesterday.

332
00:25:58,368 --> 00:26:00,349
[SPEAKER_15]: Until I had a breakfast burrito, and that made it all better.

333
00:26:00,369 --> 00:26:03,389
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I played Phantasy Star Online for about six hours.

334
00:26:04,929 --> 00:26:05,730
[SPEAKER_15]: That's all I did.

335
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:07,570
[SPEAKER_15]: PSO and sleep.

336
00:26:10,239 --> 00:26:12,020
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds very similar to a lot of my weekends.

337
00:26:12,581 --> 00:26:14,662
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds very similar to a lot of my weekends, but with a different game.

338
00:26:16,444 --> 00:26:17,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Eggnog is so good.

339
00:26:19,066 --> 00:26:20,507
[SPEAKER_15]: Baskin Robbins Eggnog Ice Cream.

340
00:26:21,167 --> 00:26:22,088
[SPEAKER_05]: And brand name, even.

341
00:26:22,328 --> 00:26:24,570
[SPEAKER_15]: And they have pumpkin pie ice cream, too.

342
00:26:27,812 --> 00:26:28,853
[SPEAKER_15]: This guy has a bony ass.

343
00:26:35,095 --> 00:26:39,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you just make the Christmas reindeer poop on your girlfriend's head?

344
00:26:40,317 --> 00:26:41,578
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to put that thing on the cam.

345
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:46,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Go put that on... Make it poop in her mouth.

346
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:47,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Do it.

347
00:26:47,701 --> 00:26:48,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Make it poop in her mouth.

348
00:26:52,083 --> 00:26:52,643
[SPEAKER_05]: That's hot.

349
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,332
[SPEAKER_05]: DDR Angel, how was your week, how was your day?

350
00:27:16,806 --> 00:27:30,009
[SPEAKER_13]: Good, I had finals on Wednesday, and, um, tried to start my shopping in the middle of the week, but that thing didn't exactly go so well, so I guess I started on, what, Friday?

351
00:27:30,249 --> 00:27:33,970
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, Friday, I believe it was Friday, or Saturday or something.

352
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:41,872
[SPEAKER_13]: But, um, I got sucked into the world in which, um, well, at least three of the people in here are hooked into.

353
00:27:42,312 --> 00:27:43,533
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, Final Fantasy XI, yay me.

354
00:27:45,726 --> 00:27:46,927
[SPEAKER_13]: I got my hat!

355
00:27:47,087 --> 00:27:47,987
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay!

356
00:27:48,948 --> 00:27:51,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Even I haven't done that fucking Santa hat quest yet.

357
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:54,211
[SPEAKER_15]: Insert word here.

358
00:27:54,231 --> 00:27:59,074
[SPEAKER_15]: That's okay, I had a bajillion Santa hats on RO.

359
00:28:00,614 --> 00:28:02,936
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they doing those Christmas wrappy things again?

360
00:28:03,116 --> 00:28:05,937
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, they're doing the Christmas present ones.

361
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:10,100
[SPEAKER_15]: But I've been trying to get a Christmas present so I can get the heart of Opa Opa.

362
00:28:11,241 --> 00:28:16,722
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I have, what Julie gave me as part of my Christmas present on PSO is I have an Opa Opa mag.

363
00:28:17,083 --> 00:28:20,864
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to tell you about the nerdiest thing you've ever heard in a little bit about an online game and Christmas events.

364
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:25,645
[SPEAKER_05]: But I've got to say, the Christmas event in Final Fantasy XI this year, not as good as last year's.

365
00:28:25,845 --> 00:28:26,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Last year's was awesome.

366
00:28:27,065 --> 00:28:29,566
[SPEAKER_15]: It was kind of fun on RO going around beating up Santa Claus.

367
00:28:29,966 --> 00:28:31,066
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, sorry Angel to cut you off.

368
00:28:32,687 --> 00:28:37,528
[SPEAKER_13]: Not much, just, you know, the Santa hat thing was like the last thing I wanted to say.

369
00:28:38,993 --> 00:28:42,015
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, the funniest thing part of this week, and it happened yesterday.

370
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:44,977
[SPEAKER_13]: Miklatov, a.k.a.

371
00:28:45,157 --> 00:28:48,600
[SPEAKER_13]: Sigurd, totally ran past me in Winders.

372
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,561
[SPEAKER_13]: He didn't even know it was me, and I had to page him.

373
00:28:50,581 --> 00:28:51,462
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm like, hey!

374
00:28:51,702 --> 00:28:52,402
[SPEAKER_13]: He's like, hi!

375
00:28:52,602 --> 00:28:54,063
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm like, yeah, you just ran past me.

376
00:28:54,083 --> 00:28:54,984
[SPEAKER_13]: He's like, I did?

377
00:28:55,004 --> 00:28:56,245
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm like, yeah, you did.

378
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:57,385
[SPEAKER_13]: It was funny.

379
00:28:57,566 --> 00:28:58,046
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, whatever.

380
00:28:58,586 --> 00:29:02,509
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, in Final Fantasy XI, sometimes if you're in a crowded area, the characters don't load all the same.

381
00:29:02,729 --> 00:29:07,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, if you go into Lower Juno, I don't know if you've been there yet, but there's so many people there that it takes a while for everybody to load.

382
00:29:08,393 --> 00:29:09,793
[SPEAKER_13]: So I spent five minutes chasing him.

383
00:29:10,034 --> 00:29:10,834
[SPEAKER_13]: Then he kind of got the hint.

384
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:11,394
[SPEAKER_13]: He's like, oh.

385
00:29:13,675 --> 00:29:14,135
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool.

386
00:29:14,755 --> 00:29:15,115
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

387
00:29:16,456 --> 00:29:16,896
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on.

388
00:29:16,916 --> 00:29:17,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go over to Loki.

389
00:29:17,876 --> 00:29:18,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, how was your week?

390
00:29:18,777 --> 00:29:19,337
[SPEAKER_05]: How was your day?

391
00:29:19,577 --> 00:29:20,637
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you must have had a busy day.

392
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:22,538
[SPEAKER_05]: I had one more thing that happened.

393
00:29:22,558 --> 00:29:23,078
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

394
00:29:23,118 --> 00:29:24,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Did we cut you off earlier?

395
00:29:24,158 --> 00:29:25,979
[SPEAKER_25]: No, but I had one more thing that happened.

396
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:27,019
[SPEAKER_25]: Is that your DS?

397
00:29:27,139 --> 00:29:27,760
[SPEAKER_25]: This is my DS.

398
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:30,300
[SPEAKER_25]: How many freaking people have to bring their DSs to the show?

399
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,561
[SPEAKER_25]: I always keep mine in my laptop case.

400
00:29:31,641 --> 00:29:32,121
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, fine.

401
00:29:32,141 --> 00:29:33,021
[SPEAKER_25]: So I can play it at work.

402
00:29:33,301 --> 00:29:33,581
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

403
00:29:34,282 --> 00:29:34,602
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, yeah.

404
00:29:34,662 --> 00:29:36,342
[SPEAKER_15]: I ordered my Christmas present from Dan today.

405
00:29:37,503 --> 00:29:37,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is?

406
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:42,031
[SPEAKER_15]: Beatmania 2DXA style, and the Parappa clapping game.

407
00:29:42,291 --> 00:29:49,314
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know, do you know I just, we're going to talk about this a little later, but you could have ordered another game on PlayAsia, which just started taking orders.

408
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:49,794
[SPEAKER_15]: What?

409
00:29:51,274 --> 00:29:52,135
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll talk about it in a little bit.

410
00:29:52,155 --> 00:29:52,355
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

411
00:29:54,535 --> 00:29:54,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

412
00:29:59,257 --> 00:30:00,237
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, anyway, moving on.

413
00:30:00,317 --> 00:30:00,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

414
00:30:02,198 --> 00:30:05,559
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, today I went to my dad's house and we had food.

415
00:30:10,459 --> 00:30:35,850
[SPEAKER_24]: and um what else did I do this week oh I went and saw Lemony Sick it's a series of unfortunate events and that was awesome and I play a lot of Final Fantasy and Christmas Shopping and yeah that's pretty much all I did just Christmas crap trying to get it done and then I got

416
00:30:36,212 --> 00:30:37,593
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Bradley, how was your week?

417
00:30:37,613 --> 00:30:38,493
[SPEAKER_24]: How was your day?

418
00:30:38,573 --> 00:30:39,993
[SPEAKER_24]: It was alright.

419
00:30:40,054 --> 00:30:40,854
[SPEAKER_24]: Did work and stuff.

420
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:13,081
[SPEAKER_06]: Got 8th style like the week before, and didn't play it again until Friday and Saturday, and some today.

421
00:31:14,602 --> 00:31:15,163
[SPEAKER_06]: And did alright.

422
00:31:15,283 --> 00:31:16,904
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually passed V for the first time ever.

423
00:31:17,225 --> 00:31:19,407
[SPEAKER_06]: That's nice.

424
00:31:20,267 --> 00:31:22,489
[SPEAKER_06]: Though I don't know if it's easier timing or whatever.

425
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:29,816
[SPEAKER_06]: I almost passed Nebula Grasper, but the first time I played it, and it killed me the rest of the time.

426
00:31:31,077 --> 00:31:32,198
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, yeah.

427
00:31:34,423 --> 00:31:36,765
[SPEAKER_06]: and a Christmas party at work on Friday.

428
00:31:36,785 --> 00:31:38,626
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

429
00:31:40,688 --> 00:31:42,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing did not much today.

430
00:31:45,432 --> 00:31:45,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

431
00:31:47,728 --> 00:31:49,910
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations on beating V. I still can't do that.

432
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:50,471
[SPEAKER_05]: It's too tough.

433
00:31:50,871 --> 00:31:51,512
[SPEAKER_05]: It's too hard.

434
00:31:52,033 --> 00:31:53,895
[SPEAKER_05]: But of course, I haven't played 2DX seriously in a long time.

435
00:31:53,935 --> 00:31:56,357
[SPEAKER_05]: I really, really need to get 8-style, and I will one of these days.

436
00:31:57,478 --> 00:31:59,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, my week and my day.

437
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,465
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I spent part of the week in L.A., which is why there was no Outside the Box this week.

438
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:04,246
[SPEAKER_05]: I was actually in L.A.

439
00:32:04,266 --> 00:32:04,986
[SPEAKER_05]: the second half of the week.

440
00:32:05,027 --> 00:32:05,988
[SPEAKER_05]: I was on a business trip.

441
00:32:06,568 --> 00:32:07,589
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a really good time.

442
00:32:07,669 --> 00:32:11,234
[SPEAKER_05]: I must say, I had a really just awesome time, but it was really busy.

443
00:32:11,274 --> 00:32:15,559
[SPEAKER_05]: We just went everywhere, and we were just busy nonstop.

444
00:32:15,579 --> 00:32:20,444
[SPEAKER_05]: And I actually got homework in the class, which was kind of weird, considering it was training, but that's what happens when you're on salary.

445
00:32:21,886 --> 00:32:26,651
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Saturday, I was hoping to go to the SVGL3 tournament.

446
00:32:27,792 --> 00:32:32,356
[SPEAKER_05]: But I didn't end up going because I was just so damn tired and I had to do errands with my parents and all this other stuff.

447
00:32:32,396 --> 00:32:34,057
[SPEAKER_05]: So I didn't end up going.

448
00:32:34,957 --> 00:32:37,159
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sorry, Angel, because I know you wanted to go.

449
00:32:37,939 --> 00:32:39,621
[SPEAKER_05]: But she seems okay with it.

450
00:32:40,201 --> 00:32:45,405
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sorry to everybody out there who was hoping to, or I should say I was hoping to run into it at Spiegel 3.

451
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:53,513
[SPEAKER_05]: But I just got beat out by wanting to sit at home and just recuperate, so that's exactly what I did.

452
00:32:53,973 --> 00:32:55,353
[SPEAKER_05]: And I played a lot of Final Fantasy XI.

453
00:32:55,533 --> 00:33:00,115
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, what ended up happening is that Saturday, here's that nerdy thing I was talking to you about.

454
00:33:00,495 --> 00:33:10,619
[SPEAKER_05]: My link shell in Final Fantasy XI, you know that's the group that you belong to, we all met up and we had a level one foot race, which means we took a level one character and took them to the most difficult areas of the game.

455
00:33:10,959 --> 00:33:11,640
[SPEAKER_05]: I was in the lead.

456
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,380
[SPEAKER_05]: I was in the lead, so I guess.

457
00:33:35,382 --> 00:33:37,143
[SPEAKER_05]: He said he was in the lead, so he got taken out.

458
00:33:38,925 --> 00:33:45,011
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we had, get this, a Final Fantasy XI gift exchange once we all got to Juno.

459
00:33:45,051 --> 00:33:50,296
[SPEAKER_05]: We all had a secret person we were supposed to buy gifts for, so we had a secret Santa in Final Fantasy XI.

460
00:33:50,756 --> 00:33:53,999
[SPEAKER_05]: And I got a plus one silver hairpin and a dagger.

461
00:33:56,181 --> 00:33:57,803
[SPEAKER_05]: That is the nerdiest thing, isn't it?

462
00:33:58,516 --> 00:33:58,716
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

463
00:33:59,236 --> 00:34:00,297
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't get anything.

464
00:34:00,377 --> 00:34:00,857
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

465
00:34:01,037 --> 00:34:18,924
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I know you did, and I think I know who has you too, but it's just that our little shellmaster, or I shouldn't say shellmaster, but event organizer, because Loki's the shellmaster, but our event organizer needs to get up off her ass and get the rest of the gifts distributed to those that weren't here, so that's what'll happen.

466
00:34:20,129 --> 00:34:20,409
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

467
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:21,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

468
00:34:22,371 --> 00:34:24,233
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's my nerdy Final Fantasy XI story.

469
00:34:24,253 --> 00:34:24,773
[SPEAKER_05]: What can I say?

470
00:34:25,474 --> 00:34:25,834
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

471
00:34:26,495 --> 00:34:28,837
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody else have anything they want to add about their week, their day?

472
00:34:29,037 --> 00:34:30,558
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got new contacts.

473
00:34:31,099 --> 00:34:31,859
[SPEAKER_05]: New contacts!

474
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:32,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they a different color?

475
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,561
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't look like it.

476
00:34:36,403 --> 00:34:39,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they're not tinted because they're not IQB2s now.

477
00:34:39,646 --> 00:34:44,470
[SPEAKER_06]: They've got some different kind that helps correct for astigmatism or something.

478
00:34:44,991 --> 00:34:45,251
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

479
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:46,512
[SPEAKER_05]: So is everything a little clearer now?

480
00:34:50,979 --> 00:34:52,000
[SPEAKER_05]: How many fingers am I holding up?

481
00:34:56,743 --> 00:34:57,783
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll give it back to you.

482
00:34:59,524 --> 00:35:00,565
[SPEAKER_05]: I got it back.

483
00:35:01,506 --> 00:35:04,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, we're such great radio.

484
00:35:04,928 --> 00:35:05,368
[SPEAKER_05]: This is great.

485
00:35:06,429 --> 00:35:08,390
[SPEAKER_05]: What have we done tonight that's been great radio bits?

486
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:09,731
[SPEAKER_05]: How many fingers am I holding up?

487
00:35:09,771 --> 00:35:10,671
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a great radio bit.

488
00:35:11,132 --> 00:35:13,133
[SPEAKER_05]: Poop in my mouth, that's a really good radio bit.

489
00:35:13,213 --> 00:35:13,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

490
00:35:14,811 --> 00:35:17,132
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a really great radio event.

491
00:35:17,492 --> 00:35:19,053
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's play radio charades.

492
00:35:19,073 --> 00:35:29,937
[SPEAKER_05]: This is why they laugh at our faces at E3 and go, Internet radio for games?

493
00:35:30,457 --> 00:35:31,437
[SPEAKER_05]: You losers.

494
00:35:32,378 --> 00:35:34,979
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm going to poop in your mouth at E3, alright?

495
00:35:35,059 --> 00:35:35,939
[SPEAKER_05]: I see how you like it.

496
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,781
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we have some big Bobani news this week.

497
00:35:41,926 --> 00:35:42,326
[SPEAKER_05]: NightStyle

498
00:36:11,411 --> 00:36:11,942
Thanks for watching!

499
00:36:56,498 --> 00:36:57,319
Thank you for watching!

500
00:38:26,085 --> 00:38:26,606
and many more.

501
00:39:37,288 --> 00:39:37,799
Thanks for watching!

502
00:40:29,441 --> 00:40:30,602
DarkSakura!

503
00:40:30,722 --> 00:40:31,482
DarkSakura!

504
00:40:55,204 --> 00:40:55,904
DarkSakura

505
00:42:10,616 --> 00:42:16,425
[SPEAKER_23]: Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

506
00:42:21,007 --> 00:42:28,790
[SPEAKER_05]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and we've been playing PictoChat during the break because we're such dorks.

507
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:31,331
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really have a better explanation other than that.

508
00:42:31,851 --> 00:42:39,814
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you've been keeping an eye on our webcam, www.orangeloungeradio.com, I did put up a picture of the pooping reindeer during the break there, as well as a little glimpse of PictoChat.

509
00:42:43,376 --> 00:42:44,356
[SPEAKER_13]: Wait, what'd you find out, Ellie?

510
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:55,056
[SPEAKER_25]: How do you shove the poop back in their ass?

511
00:42:55,816 --> 00:43:01,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Why don't you go back to Loki's room and see what else you can shove up there?

512
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Go to hell.

513
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:07,424
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, as we alluded to before we went to the break there,

514
00:43:08,317 --> 00:43:22,183
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have Beatmania 2DX Nightstyle somewhat announced for release and I say somewhat announced because basically all they really have to go off of right now I should say all we really have to go off of right now is a website that Konami of Japan has.

515
00:43:22,203 --> 00:43:36,910
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually Konami Broadcasting and they have this page which appears to be listing some of their new releases and on March 24th of 2005 they have listed Beatmania 2DX Nightstyle which means Nightstyle looks like

516
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:57,625
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all we need is confirmation that 9th style will be coming out at home for sure, which is really good because basically we've had, what, 7th style, 8th style, and now 9th style all within... I mean, we had to go, like, a long time, like, probably, what, a year and a half with no new 2DX releases at least, and then suddenly 7th style, 8th style, 9th style, and probably 10th style are all going to come out back-to-back-to-back.

517
00:43:58,106 --> 00:44:03,730
[SPEAKER_05]: So, well, not back-to-back, literally, but, you know, within a pretty good distance of each other, so this is pretty exciting, so...

518
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:07,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you guys excited about this news?

519
00:44:08,822 --> 00:44:11,864
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think about it?

520
00:44:11,884 --> 00:44:13,385
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to come stand on a mic, Jamie.

521
00:44:14,126 --> 00:44:17,128
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think of this news, Angel?

522
00:44:17,909 --> 00:44:18,789
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I like it.

523
00:44:19,930 --> 00:44:20,490
[SPEAKER_13]: Obviously.

524
00:44:21,391 --> 00:44:22,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie is back to present her opinion.

525
00:44:24,373 --> 00:44:26,375
[SPEAKER_15]: As long as it doesn't have the shit timing problems.

526
00:44:28,016 --> 00:44:30,557
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, as long as it's not that problem, then it's cool.

527
00:44:31,138 --> 00:44:32,439
[SPEAKER_15]: It'd be an improvement over the arcade.

528
00:44:34,082 --> 00:44:37,284
[SPEAKER_05]: So, basically... Sorry, we're having a little bit of sound issues here.

529
00:44:37,324 --> 00:44:42,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Those same problems I was talking about when the show started with the stripped... Stripped wires causing us to have a little bit of issue here.

530
00:44:43,287 --> 00:44:45,168
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to get that cord replaced for next week.

531
00:44:45,228 --> 00:44:45,709
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, guys.

532
00:44:46,449 --> 00:44:48,150
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I think I see exactly where the problem is, too.

533
00:44:50,231 --> 00:44:50,731
[SPEAKER_05]: Play nice!

534
00:44:51,492 --> 00:44:51,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, yes.

535
00:44:52,292 --> 00:44:56,895
[SPEAKER_05]: So, obviously... 2DX and the arcade had a little bit of...

536
00:44:58,636 --> 00:45:10,959
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the question on everybody's mind is, is it going to be fixed for the home release, or would they keep it arcade accurate so that people who practice at home can take it to the arcade, or what's going to happen?

537
00:45:11,539 --> 00:45:11,919
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

538
00:45:12,339 --> 00:45:14,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Any thoughts from a technical perspective, Loki?

539
00:45:14,939 --> 00:45:18,340
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you probably don't even care about this game, but I just thought I'd get your opinion anyway.

540
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:20,821
[SPEAKER_24]: That would be an accurate assumption.

541
00:45:22,981 --> 00:45:24,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, then tell me what you think.

542
00:45:26,002 --> 00:45:26,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's a new game, yeah.

543
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:28,660
[SPEAKER_24]: I have a pretzel.

544
00:45:31,483 --> 00:45:36,687
[SPEAKER_05]: So, the timing problems in Night Style are enough to make you despise this game, Jamie, or what's the deal?

545
00:45:38,889 --> 00:45:44,554
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, after seeing how bad the timing problems were, I swore I'd never play Night Style, and I haven't.

546
00:45:45,555 --> 00:45:47,376
[SPEAKER_05]: But do you think you're going to make an exception for the home release?

547
00:45:47,596 --> 00:45:49,698
[SPEAKER_15]: If the home release doesn't have the timing problems, then I'll buy it.

548
00:45:50,459 --> 00:45:50,639
Mm-hmm.

549
00:45:51,667 --> 00:45:52,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Fair enough.

550
00:45:53,090 --> 00:46:01,788
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, I just know I'm looking forward to with Nightstyle the new songs because Nightstyle has probably one of my favorite song lists of any

551
00:46:03,334 --> 00:46:29,416
[SPEAKER_05]: 2DX Style, really, I think it had my most favorite song list since at least 6th style, probably, maybe since 5th, I don't know, but 9th style had just so many great songs on it that I love, and I can't wait to play it at home, because I really only played 9th style in the arcade, myself personally, I think I only played 9th style in the arcade like one time, two times, I think two times is the most times I played 9th style in the arcade, and really when I went and played 10th style, I pretty much only played 9th style songs.

552
00:46:31,229 --> 00:46:32,890
[SPEAKER_05]: I was kind of one of those losers that just played those.

553
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:33,330
[SPEAKER_25]: I played Gradius.

554
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:36,831
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, that's a 10-style song, though.

555
00:46:36,851 --> 00:46:37,852
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not a 9-style song.

556
00:46:38,252 --> 00:46:39,952
[SPEAKER_15]: I just couldn't play on that 10-style machine.

557
00:46:42,293 --> 00:46:49,336
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm excited because since we had so many consumer songs and... Don't mess with the sound right now because we're... Wait for a break.

558
00:46:51,477 --> 00:46:59,860
[SPEAKER_05]: We had so many new songs on consumer-style aid that it's going to be interesting to see if we get as many on 9-style as well.

559
00:47:02,325 --> 00:47:04,428
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys hoping to see a lot of new consumer tracks?

560
00:47:04,628 --> 00:47:06,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Or you just want it to be arcade accurate?

561
00:47:06,831 --> 00:47:08,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Bring back a lot of old songs?

562
00:47:08,654 --> 00:47:08,974
[SPEAKER_05]: Or what?

563
00:47:09,495 --> 00:47:10,476
[SPEAKER_05]: Any feelings on that?

564
00:47:11,798 --> 00:47:13,460
[SPEAKER_15]: I want it to have no timing problems.

565
00:47:14,802 --> 00:47:16,844
[SPEAKER_05]: I want it to play like 8th style.

566
00:47:17,065 --> 00:47:19,388
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't care what the hell's in it, as long as it's...

567
00:47:20,711 --> 00:47:21,772
[SPEAKER_15]: As long as it has no timing problems.

568
00:47:21,792 --> 00:47:22,513
[SPEAKER_05]: As long as it has no timing problems.

569
00:47:22,533 --> 00:47:23,694
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I want to play Lion Suki.

570
00:47:24,254 --> 00:47:33,003
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to see more of the ghetto fabulous dancers, like in that one song, the 8th style consumer song that has... I miss the 4th style booty dancers.

571
00:47:33,784 --> 00:47:34,504
[SPEAKER_05]: To bring those back?

572
00:47:34,605 --> 00:47:35,605
[SPEAKER_05]: The Geary Geary Daddy dancers.

573
00:47:35,625 --> 00:47:39,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Who are the ones that look like the fembots in the one video in... Oh, God.

574
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:41,651
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't remember the name of the song.

575
00:47:42,252 --> 00:47:42,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody will get it.

576
00:47:42,893 --> 00:47:43,193
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

577
00:47:44,242 --> 00:47:46,763
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just happy that my 8th style is going to be here at the end of the week.

578
00:47:47,303 --> 00:47:48,083
[SPEAKER_15]: So I can play dancer.

579
00:47:48,523 --> 00:47:52,224
[SPEAKER_05]: So as you were saying before, you went ahead and you ordered your 8th style.

580
00:47:53,124 --> 00:47:53,324
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

581
00:47:53,564 --> 00:48:04,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, I got a little private message in the chat room over here saying DarkLionXVI says that actually over on PlayAsia right now, you can pre-order 9th style if you're so inclined.

582
00:48:04,926 --> 00:48:07,627
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not going to pre-order it until I know that the issues are fixed.

583
00:48:10,031 --> 00:48:12,272
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't Be Afraid Myself is what they're saying it is.

584
00:48:12,672 --> 00:48:13,493
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think that's it.

585
00:48:13,573 --> 00:48:16,014
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like Love Something was the name of the song.

586
00:48:16,034 --> 00:48:18,256
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't Be Afraid Myself had the girls dancing in the bathroom.

587
00:48:18,276 --> 00:48:23,879
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the one, yeah, that's the one that's like the, I don't know, the pop video.

588
00:48:23,959 --> 00:48:27,661
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm talking about the one that had the... They were dancing in a damn locker room shower.

589
00:48:27,861 --> 00:48:29,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm not, that's not the one I'm thinking of.

590
00:48:29,882 --> 00:48:36,526
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm thinking of the one where they're all dressed up in the hippie stuff and they were driving through Tokyo and stuff or something.

591
00:48:39,275 --> 00:48:40,397
[SPEAKER_05]: Why can't I think of the name of that song?

592
00:48:40,437 --> 00:48:43,681
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking it up right now because I'm so pissed I can't think of what that song is.

593
00:48:45,943 --> 00:48:46,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Love Box!

594
00:48:47,946 --> 00:48:48,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Love Box.

595
00:48:48,927 --> 00:48:50,189
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the song I was trying to think of.

596
00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:52,071
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got a pretty dirty title.

597
00:48:52,091 --> 00:48:53,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Nelly's snickering over there.

598
00:48:54,094 --> 00:48:54,955
[SPEAKER_05]: He said box.

599
00:48:57,238 --> 00:48:57,518
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

600
00:48:59,955 --> 00:49:03,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, so most folks are going to be pretty excited about Night Style.

601
00:49:03,836 --> 00:49:09,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, as soon as we know more information about the game, we will be presenting it to you guys.

602
00:49:09,659 --> 00:49:15,341
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's funny, looking in the chatroom, they're going, Lovebox, Lovebox, fucking Lovebox, god damn.

603
00:49:16,241 --> 00:49:18,122
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to remember, guys, you're on a buffer.

604
00:49:18,182 --> 00:49:23,624
[SPEAKER_05]: You're about 30, 45 seconds behind everything, so... Losers.

605
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:29,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, I guess what we'll do is we're going to take another quick break because it looks like we're working on some sound issues in here.

606
00:49:29,741 --> 00:49:33,663
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to do a quick break, some more 2DX9 style songs since we're so excited about this.

607
00:49:34,223 --> 00:49:37,264
[SPEAKER_05]: And when we come back, maybe we'll take some calls over the Skype line.

608
00:49:37,584 --> 00:49:39,645
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, at some point tonight, we've got to do a new list list.

609
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:42,506
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to have a cage match tonight at some point.

610
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:45,407
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll listen to Jamie Belch some more.

611
00:49:45,548 --> 00:49:46,208
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry.

612
00:49:46,708 --> 00:49:47,148
[SPEAKER_15]: It's your fault.

613
00:49:47,168 --> 00:49:48,029
[SPEAKER_15]: You gave me the soda.

614
00:49:48,229 --> 00:49:49,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, you're right.

615
00:49:49,649 --> 00:49:51,170
[SPEAKER_15]: This is the best stuff in the world.

616
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:51,830
[SPEAKER_05]: You're right.

617
00:49:51,870 --> 00:49:52,430
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all my fault.

618
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:53,591
[SPEAKER_15]: Sugar-free junk soda.

619
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:56,944
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we'll be back after this, you guys.

620
00:50:37,913 --> 00:50:38,594
Thanks for watching!

621
00:51:53,375 --> 00:51:55,948
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be right back after some more music here on Orange Lounge Radio.

622
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:54,784
and more.

623
00:54:26,158 --> 00:54:27,200
Thank you for watching!

624
00:56:00,687 --> 00:56:26,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio With the Ping Pong Balls We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio And it looks like we actually fixed some of the sound We replaced a cord So Loki was kind enough to do a little switcheroo there during the break Swapped a cord out So hopefully that'll minimize those sound issues we've been having I notice the buzz is still there a little bit But it doesn't sound as bad in my monitor here So we'll see

625
00:56:27,611 --> 00:56:28,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank God!

626
00:56:29,172 --> 00:56:29,453
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

627
00:56:29,893 --> 00:56:30,654
[SPEAKER_05]: Hooray for Loki!

628
00:56:30,674 --> 00:56:32,095
[SPEAKER_05]: This is why we call him the Techmaster.

629
00:56:33,456 --> 00:56:38,680
[SPEAKER_05]: In the chatroom during that break, they were complaining, or I shouldn't say complaining, but they were talking about some of the different Night Style songs.

630
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:40,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have a favorite Night Style song?

631
00:56:40,401 --> 00:56:43,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though the timing pushes you off, is there a favorite Night Style song you have?

632
00:56:43,184 --> 00:56:44,124
[SPEAKER_15]: All of the Taku songs.

633
00:56:45,526 --> 00:56:47,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, uh, what, Distress and, uh, Lower World?

634
00:56:47,427 --> 00:56:48,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Distress, I'd have to say.

635
00:56:48,548 --> 00:56:48,988
[SPEAKER_05]: No, Lower World.

636
00:56:49,008 --> 00:56:49,789
[SPEAKER_05]: What the hell am I thinking?

637
00:56:49,809 --> 00:56:52,891
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd have to say, actually, Distress is the best.

638
00:56:53,352 --> 00:56:54,613
[SPEAKER_15]: And, of course, I'd do, like, Lionski.

639
00:56:56,498 --> 00:56:59,179
[SPEAKER_05]: My favorite song in 9th style is Power Dream, because I love ping pong.

640
00:57:00,499 --> 00:57:06,701
[SPEAKER_15]: There's another one that I liked, but I don't remember the name of it, because I didn't really keep up too much with 9th style.

641
00:57:06,801 --> 00:57:07,721
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, Bad Boy Bass.

642
00:57:10,561 --> 00:57:12,802
[SPEAKER_15]: Everyone is something, I don't remember the song.

643
00:57:15,463 --> 00:57:15,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

644
00:57:15,803 --> 00:57:21,084
[SPEAKER_05]: What we're going to do now is we're actually going to talk to somebody over the Skype line.

645
00:57:22,148 --> 00:57:28,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody actually called and said they had something they wanted to talk to us about, so we're going to go ahead and pick up the Skype line here.

646
00:57:28,856 --> 00:57:30,198
[SPEAKER_05]: I just told them to give us a call here.

647
00:57:31,179 --> 00:57:32,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

648
00:57:33,602 --> 00:57:34,263
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey, what's up?

649
00:57:34,523 --> 00:57:35,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, and who is this?

650
00:57:36,506 --> 00:57:37,146
[SPEAKER_19]: It's Sherlock.

651
00:57:37,407 --> 00:57:38,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, Sherlock, how are you?

652
00:57:39,953 --> 00:57:40,914
[SPEAKER_19]: How are you doing today?

653
00:57:41,114 --> 00:57:41,715
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm good!

654
00:57:41,795 --> 00:57:50,323
[SPEAKER_05]: For those of you folks who don't know, Sherlock, one of the moderators over on DDR Freak, which by the way, DDR Freak, kind enough to replay Orange Lounge Radio Friday nights.

655
00:57:50,383 --> 00:57:51,944
[SPEAKER_15]: And he has the best hat ever.

656
00:57:52,585 --> 00:57:54,166
[SPEAKER_05]: That hat is sexy.

657
00:57:56,528 --> 00:57:59,591
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen pictures of the hat and I think I saw the hat from a distance at E3.

658
00:58:00,732 --> 00:58:04,614
[SPEAKER_05]: It was kind of like going to a rock concert.

659
00:58:04,694 --> 00:58:07,676
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, you know, I think I can kind of make it out.

660
00:58:07,836 --> 00:58:09,757
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I can kind of make out that person.

661
00:58:10,077 --> 00:58:10,978
[SPEAKER_19]: You can almost see it.

662
00:58:11,098 --> 00:58:11,899
[SPEAKER_05]: You can almost see it.

663
00:58:12,179 --> 00:58:13,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, what's on your mind, Sherlock?

664
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:23,365
[SPEAKER_19]: I found something online that kind of confused me a bit, but it also made me just spin my head, and it really just threw me for a turn.

665
00:58:23,425 --> 00:58:24,746
[SPEAKER_19]: It's DDR-related.

666
00:58:25,425 --> 00:58:33,195
[SPEAKER_19]: and uh... A lot of DDR things kind of make me question myself sometimes, but... Yeah, I mean, you know, everyone keeps talking about, you know, is DDR dead?

667
00:58:33,235 --> 00:58:33,935
[SPEAKER_19]: What's going on?

668
00:58:33,955 --> 00:58:37,440
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, the whole April Fool's thing, you know, put everyone in for a turn.

669
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:41,524
[SPEAKER_19]: But, something came up that really confused me.

670
00:58:41,685 --> 00:58:41,745
[SPEAKER_19]: If...

671
00:58:42,418 --> 00:58:50,943
[SPEAKER_19]: If you guys go to the Konami Arcade website for DDR Extreme, it's konami.co.jp slash am slash ddr underscore new.

672
00:58:51,443 --> 00:58:54,005
[SPEAKER_19]: Brings you up to the DDR website for DDR Extreme.

673
00:58:54,165 --> 00:58:55,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, run that by me one more time.

674
00:58:55,265 --> 00:59:07,833
[SPEAKER_19]: konami.co.jp slash am slash ddr slash ddr new slash ddr new Alright?

675
00:59:08,033 --> 00:59:09,874
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, it's the Extreme webpage.

676
00:59:11,028 --> 00:59:17,550
[SPEAKER_19]: And if you look at it, the logo up top has a little Santa Claus logo in it.

677
00:59:18,790 --> 00:59:26,291
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, what I'm trying to figure out is why they decided to update a two-year-old webpage with a little Santa Claus logo.

678
00:59:26,672 --> 00:59:29,272
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, Loki's tapping me, he says it's, what?

679
00:59:29,552 --> 00:59:31,873
[SPEAKER_24]: That's fucking old, that's from like last time.

680
00:59:31,913 --> 00:59:35,113
[SPEAKER_24]: That was back when they were talking about the original DDR stream coming out.

681
00:59:35,674 --> 00:59:37,374
[SPEAKER_24]: And that Santa Claus has been there all the time.

682
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:39,020
[SPEAKER_19]: No, it hasn't.

683
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:40,061
[SPEAKER_19]: Not that I remember.

684
00:59:40,621 --> 00:59:41,181
[SPEAKER_24]: It's been there.

685
00:59:41,321 --> 00:59:41,761
[SPEAKER_24]: Trust me.

686
00:59:43,562 --> 00:59:44,902
[SPEAKER_19]: I've never seen that there before.

687
00:59:45,422 --> 00:59:45,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

688
00:59:46,003 --> 00:59:51,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, now, but I do remember that Extreme came out at Christmas time.

689
00:59:51,644 --> 00:59:52,685
[SPEAKER_05]: I do remember that.

690
00:59:53,005 --> 00:59:55,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Extreme came out Christmas Day in 2002, didn't it?

691
00:59:56,026 --> 00:59:56,526
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to say.

692
00:59:56,546 --> 00:59:58,306
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been there.

693
00:59:58,827 --> 01:00:00,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki swears up and down it's been there the whole time.

694
01:00:01,528 --> 01:00:02,308
[SPEAKER_19]: It hasn't been.

695
01:00:02,408 --> 01:00:02,768
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

696
01:00:04,028 --> 01:00:05,729
[SPEAKER_19]: Why would they keep it there over summer?

697
01:00:06,793 --> 01:00:12,155
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, but isn't, yeah, this is the journal of Naoki Madea and stuff.

698
01:00:12,215 --> 01:00:14,096
[SPEAKER_05]: Why would they bother to update this?

699
01:00:14,176 --> 01:00:14,656
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

700
01:00:15,596 --> 01:00:17,577
[SPEAKER_05]: You, well, I don't know.

701
01:00:18,017 --> 01:00:19,037
[SPEAKER_19]: I wish I could say.

702
01:00:19,858 --> 01:00:21,418
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not the same, and I'll tell you why.

703
01:00:21,758 --> 01:00:22,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

704
01:00:22,279 --> 01:00:27,200
[SPEAKER_19]: Because the image name is ddrex2.gif.

705
01:00:28,261 --> 01:00:30,121
[SPEAKER_19]: And then, well, if you view the image.

706
01:00:30,621 --> 01:00:31,622
[SPEAKER_05]: If you take out the 2.

707
01:00:32,562 --> 01:00:34,823
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, if you take out the 2, there's the original logo.

708
01:00:36,314 --> 01:00:36,955
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

709
01:00:37,055 --> 01:00:41,718
[SPEAKER_05]: So... Well, but when did the journal... Okay, Loki's getting frustrated.

710
01:00:42,779 --> 01:00:48,143
[SPEAKER_24]: Because that was like one of the last journals that they did on there, and they changed the logo for the last journal.

711
01:00:48,523 --> 01:00:55,849
[SPEAKER_05]: DDR EX... The EX1 or whatever is for the previous journals in that series there, because there's multiple pages for that journal, so...

712
01:00:56,437 --> 01:00:57,998
[SPEAKER_19]: I know there is, but I don't know.

713
01:00:58,658 --> 01:00:58,898
[SPEAKER_19]: Old.

714
01:00:59,899 --> 01:01:00,079
[SPEAKER_05]: Old.

715
01:01:00,279 --> 01:01:01,580
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not anything new.

716
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:02,520
[SPEAKER_05]: It's old.

717
01:01:03,241 --> 01:01:04,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, quit ruining Christmas.

718
01:01:04,741 --> 01:01:05,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Jesus.

719
01:01:06,903 --> 01:01:09,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Give the boy hope for this holiday season.

720
01:01:09,144 --> 01:01:11,485
[SPEAKER_05]: What the hell is wrong with you, you Grinch?

721
01:01:12,706 --> 01:01:13,326
[SPEAKER_24]: All right, fine.

722
01:01:13,346 --> 01:01:14,767
[SPEAKER_24]: If you want to go ahead and do that.

723
01:01:15,167 --> 01:01:18,489
[SPEAKER_24]: If you look at that picture through a center graph, there's a secret code in there.

724
01:01:18,509 --> 01:01:22,471
[SPEAKER_24]: It takes you to a secret website that's all about the background information of DDR EX2.

725
01:01:24,076 --> 01:01:24,376
[SPEAKER_19]: Really?

726
01:01:24,416 --> 01:01:25,037
[SPEAKER_24]: There you go.

727
01:01:25,417 --> 01:01:27,319
[SPEAKER_24]: There's your conspiracy theory for the year.

728
01:01:27,399 --> 01:01:28,179
[SPEAKER_19]: Is it purple?

729
01:01:29,981 --> 01:01:30,741
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not purple.

730
01:01:30,961 --> 01:01:32,042
[SPEAKER_24]: It's fuchsia!

731
01:01:32,122 --> 01:01:36,906
[SPEAKER_19]: Are you going to argue with me about colors now?

732
01:01:36,966 --> 01:01:38,047
[SPEAKER_19]: Come on, it was purple.

733
01:01:41,569 --> 01:01:46,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody knows that it's going to be DDR fuchsia.

734
01:01:46,153 --> 01:01:49,535
[SPEAKER_24]: That's the new... It's like 2DX Red, DDR fuchsia, okay?

735
01:01:49,575 --> 01:01:50,436
[SPEAKER_24]: Trust me on this.

736
01:01:51,388 --> 01:01:52,309
[SPEAKER_19]: I've got to know!

737
01:01:52,569 --> 01:01:53,569
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, I found the code!

738
01:01:53,589 --> 01:01:55,990
[SPEAKER_19]: Can we color a little bit less homosexual?

739
01:01:56,030 --> 01:01:56,631
[SPEAKER_19]: Come on!

740
01:01:57,591 --> 01:01:58,912
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey, please!

741
01:01:59,092 --> 01:02:05,736
[SPEAKER_24]: Fine, if you really want to know what the color is, it's super fuchsia, but you know, I'm not one to judge their title, okay?

742
01:02:05,836 --> 01:02:06,276
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't get it.

743
01:02:06,616 --> 01:02:07,176
No, no.

744
01:02:07,516 --> 01:02:10,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the homosexual one would be fabulous fuchsia.

745
01:02:14,205 --> 01:02:17,488
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope so too I hope he is, but I unfortunately don't think he is in this case

746
01:02:39,577 --> 01:02:44,159
[SPEAKER_19]: I haven't heard anyone else say otherwise, so Loki's the first one to say something wrong.

747
01:02:44,499 --> 01:02:45,759
[SPEAKER_05]: When he says it, he says it loud.

748
01:02:45,799 --> 01:02:46,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't let that scare you.

749
01:02:48,220 --> 01:02:48,600
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright.

750
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:50,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well thanks for the tip, Sherlock.

751
01:02:50,221 --> 01:02:51,801
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you doing otherwise?

752
01:02:54,282 --> 01:02:55,603
[SPEAKER_19]: Life's had its ups and downs.

753
01:02:58,273 --> 01:02:59,253
[SPEAKER_05]: How's DDR in New York?

754
01:02:59,413 --> 01:03:01,554
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't hear a whole lot about what's going on in New York.

755
01:03:01,834 --> 01:03:03,754
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh God, don't get me started.

756
01:03:04,314 --> 01:03:05,035
[SPEAKER_19]: Don't get me started.

757
01:03:05,055 --> 01:03:07,415
[SPEAKER_19]: We had to lock the forums like two weeks back.

758
01:03:07,496 --> 01:03:09,996
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not talking about the interweb drama.

759
01:03:10,016 --> 01:03:10,937
[SPEAKER_05]: The interweb?

760
01:03:11,877 --> 01:03:12,917
[SPEAKER_05]: How's the scene going?

761
01:03:13,457 --> 01:03:14,738
[SPEAKER_19]: The scene itself?

762
01:03:15,758 --> 01:03:17,159
[SPEAKER_19]: Not much better, I'll give you that.

763
01:03:17,439 --> 01:03:18,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's a bummer.

764
01:03:19,439 --> 01:03:24,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Go out there with some defibrillators and breathe some life into DDR a little bit.

765
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:26,201
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not changing.

766
01:03:26,241 --> 01:03:27,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing's changed around here at all.

767
01:03:28,082 --> 01:03:30,604
[SPEAKER_05]: Sherlock, go spread the Santa rumor all around.

768
01:03:30,624 --> 01:03:31,265
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll all buy it.

769
01:03:31,345 --> 01:03:31,845
[SPEAKER_05]: I will.

770
01:03:31,885 --> 01:03:32,345
[SPEAKER_05]: I will.

771
01:03:32,405 --> 01:03:33,046
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to.

772
01:03:33,146 --> 01:03:33,746
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, you do that.

773
01:03:34,507 --> 01:03:34,827
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

774
01:03:35,248 --> 01:03:36,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, thanks for calling, Sherlock.

775
01:03:36,909 --> 01:03:37,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a good one.

776
01:03:38,330 --> 01:03:38,750
[SPEAKER_19]: You too.

777
01:03:38,810 --> 01:03:39,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Later.

778
01:03:39,130 --> 01:03:40,271
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard it here first.

779
01:03:40,832 --> 01:03:41,552
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, hold on.

780
01:03:42,113 --> 01:03:42,873
[SPEAKER_24]: What?

781
01:03:42,913 --> 01:03:45,215
[SPEAKER_24]: I said you heard it here first, DDR Fuchsia.

782
01:03:48,246 --> 01:04:08,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, DDR Fuchsia Well, I'm glad Sherlock decided to call the show Even if he may be chasing a ghost Not unlike one of our co-hosts here on the show No, he's just chasing nothing Sorry It's been there, okay?

783
01:04:08,822 --> 01:04:11,564
[SPEAKER_24]: It's been there forever Ever and ever

784
01:04:13,203 --> 01:04:13,963
[SPEAKER_05]: You still look grinch.

785
01:04:14,324 --> 01:04:14,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

786
01:04:16,525 --> 01:04:17,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, moving on.

787
01:04:17,865 --> 01:04:20,747
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to do a little bit of a follow-up to something we were talking about last week.

788
01:04:21,807 --> 01:04:24,809
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie, this has to do with something you brought up, and it's the girl...

789
01:04:25,319 --> 01:04:31,062
[SPEAKER_05]: The Little Girl That Killed The Other Little Girl, and now has the internet obsession going on about her?

790
01:04:31,122 --> 01:04:32,342
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I have a banner for it now.

791
01:04:32,362 --> 01:04:34,123
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I just, I was going to bring that up.

792
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:42,007
[SPEAKER_05]: The hell possessed you to go and make a banner and imagine, for those that didn't catch last week's show, just a little catch up.

793
01:04:42,027 --> 01:04:43,108
[SPEAKER_25]: I'll put a link to it in the chat room.

794
01:04:43,288 --> 01:04:45,649
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, give us this Cliff Notes version.

795
01:04:45,689 --> 01:04:46,489
[SPEAKER_05]: What's going on here?

796
01:04:47,010 --> 01:04:49,291
[SPEAKER_05]: What happened and why is there an internet obsession about it?

797
01:04:50,248 --> 01:04:55,211
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, there was a girl who killed one of her classmates.

798
01:04:55,712 --> 01:05:01,495
[SPEAKER_15]: In the class picture, this little girl was wearing a University of Nevada sweatshirt.

799
01:05:01,575 --> 01:05:03,937
[SPEAKER_15]: It just says Nevada all the way across, and it's a blue sweatshirt.

800
01:05:05,078 --> 01:05:08,680
[SPEAKER_15]: And there's all indications that they were friends and everything.

801
01:05:11,222 --> 01:05:14,124
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, it started this whole big internet obsession.

802
01:05:15,135 --> 01:05:21,480
[SPEAKER_15]: And keep in mind, they're doing her as a character, not as she herself.

803
01:05:22,621 --> 01:05:26,884
[SPEAKER_15]: And because she was 12 years old, they couldn't prosecute her.

804
01:05:26,944 --> 01:05:31,147
[SPEAKER_15]: Because the age of criminal responsibility in Japan is 14.

805
01:05:31,987 --> 01:05:36,871
[SPEAKER_15]: Which was actually lowered to 14 because of another child murder.

806
01:05:38,712 --> 01:05:40,634
[SPEAKER_15]: And there's like tons of fan art now.

807
01:05:40,714 --> 01:05:41,975
[SPEAKER_15]: Tons and tons of fan art.

808
01:05:42,691 --> 01:05:45,392
[SPEAKER_15]: So I took one of the pictures and made a banner out of it.

809
01:05:46,353 --> 01:05:57,358
[SPEAKER_05]: And what I like, you know how when people that want to be fashionable with their banners online, they have the banner and then they have the matching little avatar that goes with it, the little box that sits under the name.

810
01:05:57,799 --> 01:06:06,643
[SPEAKER_05]: What I liked about what Jamie did, not only does she have this going on on DDR Freak, but she has it going on on the Orange Lodge Radio forums as well as probably every other forum out there right now that she frequents.

811
01:06:07,203 --> 01:06:14,207
[SPEAKER_05]: She's got the little banner that has the little Nevada girl on it and it says DarkSakura and then the little avatar is a little box cutter.

812
01:06:14,227 --> 01:06:22,651
[SPEAKER_15]: It's actually from the same picture because I wanted to get the whole thing of her holding the box cutter but the size didn't reduce the way I liked it to.

813
01:06:23,111 --> 01:06:27,033
[SPEAKER_15]: So I said just her holding the box cutter and I'm going to post it in the chat room.

814
01:06:28,061 --> 01:06:28,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, you do that.

815
01:06:28,701 --> 01:06:29,442
[SPEAKER_05]: You post it in chat.

816
01:06:29,902 --> 01:06:31,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Or, you can check it out for yourself.

817
01:06:31,722 --> 01:06:36,984
[SPEAKER_05]: Just go to the Orange Lounge Radio forums and there should be a post from Jamie in there.

818
01:06:37,024 --> 01:06:42,686
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to give a cheap advertisement in there somewhere for people to visit our dying forums.

819
01:06:43,727 --> 01:06:45,307
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

820
01:06:45,327 --> 01:06:48,768
[SPEAKER_15]: I want the quote thread to evolve.

821
01:06:48,928 --> 01:06:56,151
[SPEAKER_05]: In order for the quote thread to come back, people have to actually use our chat room, don't you think?

822
01:06:57,594 --> 01:07:00,337
[SPEAKER_25]: Angel is mouthing that right along with me like I was at the Rocky Horror Picture Show or something.

823
01:07:00,357 --> 01:07:01,297
[SPEAKER_05]: He's just mouthing it along.

824
01:07:19,232 --> 01:07:21,596
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sad that you quit, just so you know.

825
01:07:29,423 --> 01:07:30,364
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, you know what?

826
01:07:30,604 --> 01:07:32,506
[SPEAKER_15]: How about for Christmas you pay for me to play again?

827
01:07:32,846 --> 01:07:33,606
I'm kidding.

828
01:07:34,707 --> 01:07:35,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, how about that gift card?

829
01:07:36,028 --> 01:07:38,510
[SPEAKER_05]: How about that pooping reindeer?

830
01:07:38,530 --> 01:07:42,153
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I actually did have half of the temptation to reinstall it.

831
01:07:43,615 --> 01:07:44,295
[SPEAKER_05]: Temptation's good.

832
01:07:44,555 --> 01:07:46,157
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I thought, why?

833
01:07:46,597 --> 01:07:47,498
[SPEAKER_15]: I won't have time.

834
01:07:48,498 --> 01:07:51,581
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, once the school year starts again, once the semester starts.

835
01:07:51,641 --> 01:07:54,283
[SPEAKER_05]: When you get really addicted like me, you make time.

836
01:07:55,124 --> 01:07:56,345
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what I have the gem for.

837
01:07:58,487 --> 01:07:58,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, snap.

838
01:07:59,483 --> 01:08:01,425
[SPEAKER_15]: That's my addiction, is exercise.

839
01:08:02,106 --> 01:08:03,467
[SPEAKER_05]: My addiction is feeling fit.

840
01:08:04,788 --> 01:08:07,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I like endorphins.

841
01:08:07,411 --> 01:08:10,774
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to take me to the gym sometime, because I want to see what this is all about.

842
01:08:11,134 --> 01:08:11,454
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

843
01:08:12,796 --> 01:08:13,136
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometime.

844
01:08:14,497 --> 01:08:15,999
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's have ourselves a cage match, shall we?

845
01:08:18,621 --> 01:08:18,961
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not?

846
01:08:18,981 --> 01:08:19,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not?

847
01:08:20,419 --> 01:08:26,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, the way the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match works, we play three songs for you guys, and you guys pick your favorite song.

848
01:08:27,143 --> 01:08:30,405
[SPEAKER_05]: The winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio.

849
01:08:31,106 --> 01:08:38,010
[SPEAKER_05]: Each host picks a song, and you get to hear a clip of last week's winner, as well as two brand new songs.

850
01:08:38,670 --> 01:08:41,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Last week in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, it came down to The Wire.

851
01:08:42,273 --> 01:08:43,513
[SPEAKER_05]: It was incredibly insane.

852
01:08:43,553 --> 01:08:46,115
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a three-way tie.

853
01:08:46,535 --> 01:08:50,818
[SPEAKER_05]: A three-way tie, and it was three new songs because we had to retire a song last week.

854
01:08:51,619 --> 01:08:59,184
[SPEAKER_05]: So DDR Angel ended up breaking the tie, and a lot of folks in the chat room are very passionate about their dislike for this song.

855
01:08:59,644 --> 01:09:02,947
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's going to have a hard time holding on tonight, but we'll see.

856
01:09:03,783 --> 01:09:04,303
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

857
01:09:04,423 --> 01:09:08,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe people will see something in the song tonight that they didn't see before.

858
01:09:08,605 --> 01:09:10,066
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, but here it is.

859
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:11,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Song number one you can vote for tonight.

860
01:09:12,447 --> 01:09:16,249
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the artist called J-Punch and the song is called Bitch.

861
01:09:16,629 --> 01:09:16,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Enjoy.

862
01:09:17,009 --> 01:09:31,116
[SPEAKER_11]: And I hate myself

863
01:09:32,984 --> 01:09:35,430
[SPEAKER_11]: And I tried You're a bitch, you're a

864
01:11:17,931 --> 01:11:20,432
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, that was song number one in tonight's cage match.

865
01:11:21,252 --> 01:11:23,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Bitch by J-Punch.

866
01:11:24,653 --> 01:11:29,275
[SPEAKER_05]: And looks like the chat room is about ready to take their handguns to that song.

867
01:11:30,075 --> 01:11:31,116
[SPEAKER_05]: They're bitching!

868
01:11:31,136 --> 01:11:32,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they're bitching.

869
01:11:33,537 --> 01:11:34,977
[SPEAKER_05]: You're so funny, Jamie!

870
01:11:35,537 --> 01:11:35,817
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

871
01:11:37,978 --> 01:11:41,259
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see what's going to try and knock this bitch out of here tonight.

872
01:11:41,279 --> 01:11:43,020
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll start it off with DarkSakura's pick.

873
01:11:44,235 --> 01:11:45,475
[SPEAKER_05]: I picked an overclocked mix.

874
01:11:46,316 --> 01:11:52,758
[SPEAKER_05]: This is good because we were talking about overclocked a little bit last week and how Loki is going to submit his remix any day now, right?

875
01:11:53,458 --> 01:11:54,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, no I'm not actually.

876
01:11:55,379 --> 01:11:56,359
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, what caused this change?

877
01:11:56,379 --> 01:11:57,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on, hold on.

878
01:11:58,760 --> 01:11:59,581
[SPEAKER_05]: What caused the change?

879
01:12:00,641 --> 01:12:05,363
[SPEAKER_24]: It doesn't, it's not, no, it's not the type of remix to be on that site.

880
01:12:05,423 --> 01:12:06,543
[SPEAKER_24]: Sorry, that's it, period.

881
01:12:07,403 --> 01:12:08,984
[SPEAKER_24]: No discussion, it's not going up there.

882
01:12:09,884 --> 01:12:11,465
[SPEAKER_05]: He is not going to compromise his art.

883
01:12:13,061 --> 01:12:14,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, back to what we were talking about here.

884
01:12:15,242 --> 01:12:17,704
[SPEAKER_15]: I just realized there's a lot of crap on Overclocked, though.

885
01:12:18,324 --> 01:12:21,005
[SPEAKER_15]: A lot of really crappy remixes.

886
01:12:21,025 --> 01:12:22,046
[SPEAKER_15]: But not this song, right?

887
01:12:22,146 --> 01:12:22,286
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

888
01:12:22,586 --> 01:12:26,268
[SPEAKER_15]: This one's a remix from Raiden 2, which is one of my favorite shooter games of all time.

889
01:12:27,209 --> 01:12:32,392
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, my favorite in the series is Raiden DX, but Raiden 2 was the first one that had these electric things.

890
01:12:32,952 --> 01:12:41,597
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like this big purple line that shoots out and latches onto people and zooms around them, and I was like, that was the coolest weapon in a shooting game ever.

891
01:12:42,117 --> 01:12:44,479
[SPEAKER_15]: Next to the Fist in Twinbee.

892
01:12:45,220 --> 01:12:46,641
[SPEAKER_15]: So I had to download that.

893
01:12:46,661 --> 01:12:48,203
[SPEAKER_15]: And it actually turned out to be a pretty cool one.

894
01:12:48,243 --> 01:12:52,386
[SPEAKER_15]: So I don't remember the name that they named it, but it's something from Raiden 2.

895
01:12:53,067 --> 01:12:53,728
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll give you a hint.

896
01:12:53,748 --> 01:12:59,553
[SPEAKER_05]: The artist is Tefnek, and the song is called the Raiden 2 Airborne Overclock Mix.

897
01:12:59,733 --> 01:13:00,294
[SPEAKER_05]: How's that sound?

898
01:13:01,164 --> 01:13:01,525
[SPEAKER_15]: Raiden.

899
01:13:02,005 --> 01:13:02,245
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

900
01:13:02,366 --> 01:13:02,746
[SPEAKER_05]: Oops, sorry.

901
01:13:02,846 --> 01:13:03,247
[SPEAKER_05]: Raiden.

902
01:13:03,447 --> 01:13:07,552
[SPEAKER_05]: I keep thinking Mortal Kombat since Raiden or Fatal Fury for that same spelling.

903
01:13:08,153 --> 01:13:08,493
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

904
01:13:08,994 --> 01:13:09,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Here it is.

905
01:13:10,015 --> 01:13:12,879
[SPEAKER_05]: Tefnek Raiden 2 Airborne OC Remix.

906
01:13:12,919 --> 01:13:13,219
[SPEAKER_05]: Enjoy.

907
01:13:17,099 --> 01:13:18,260
Thanks for watching!

908
01:16:17,242 --> 01:16:20,668
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

909
01:17:46,849 --> 01:17:52,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, song number two in tonight's cage match was Teth Neck, Raiden II, Airborne.

910
01:17:52,874 --> 01:17:54,516
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a remix coming to you from Overclocked.

911
01:17:55,116 --> 01:17:59,059
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see if that song overclocked or underclocked with the judges here in the room.

912
01:17:59,099 --> 01:17:59,780
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think, Jamie?

913
01:18:00,260 --> 01:18:05,204
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I liked it, obviously, or else I wouldn't have picked it, so it gets a nine for me.

914
01:18:05,765 --> 01:18:06,566
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, fair enough.

915
01:18:07,086 --> 01:18:07,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki?

916
01:18:07,426 --> 01:18:10,309
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I've heard it before, actually.

917
01:18:10,329 --> 01:18:11,330
[SPEAKER_24]: It gets an eight.

918
01:18:14,292 --> 01:18:14,672
[SPEAKER_05]: Arcadian 42.

919
01:18:16,949 --> 01:18:18,010
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked it, I'll give it an 8

920
01:18:34,136 --> 01:18:43,704
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought the song was, it was very fluffy, flying on the clouds type thing, I don't know if it's the song I'd go like, yeah, rock on, this song, but it's cute.

921
01:18:44,204 --> 01:18:49,268
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely video game ambience type music, so I'd give it like a, nah, an 8, why not.

922
01:18:50,989 --> 01:18:52,150
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we can hear you, Arcadian.

923
01:18:52,450 --> 01:18:53,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, where would you give that one?

924
01:18:53,751 --> 01:18:54,332
[SPEAKER_06]: It was alright.

925
01:18:54,892 --> 01:18:55,673
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll give it an 8.

926
01:18:56,448 --> 01:18:58,129
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, and 8 from Arcadian as well.

927
01:18:58,469 --> 01:18:59,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember, though, it's not up to us.

928
01:18:59,610 --> 01:19:03,392
[SPEAKER_05]: It's up to you guys in the chat room at www.orangelandre.com and chat.

929
01:19:03,432 --> 01:19:04,473
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys get the final say.

930
01:19:04,993 --> 01:19:06,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, it's your turn.

931
01:19:06,234 --> 01:19:08,195
[SPEAKER_05]: What song did you pick for us tonight?

932
01:19:08,215 --> 01:19:11,537
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to give them a second try.

933
01:19:12,158 --> 01:19:19,182
[SPEAKER_24]: This is Monolithic with House of Joy off of their newest CD, Diving Descenders.

934
01:19:20,549 --> 01:19:23,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, one more time, giving them a try here in the cage match.

935
01:19:23,842 --> 01:19:25,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Monolithic, House of Joy.

936
01:19:25,970 --> 01:19:26,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Enjoy.

937
01:25:24,497 --> 01:25:40,160
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, that was song number three in tonight's cage match.

938
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:41,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Monolithic with House of Joy.

939
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:46,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go around and see if that was House of Joy or House of Pain to people.

940
01:25:46,401 --> 01:25:47,662
[SPEAKER_15]: House of Pain was cool.

941
01:25:48,302 --> 01:25:49,042
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's see.

942
01:25:49,082 --> 01:25:49,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Starting off with Jamie.

943
01:25:50,529 --> 01:25:54,592
[SPEAKER_15]: That guy, okay, I'm sorry, if you're going to be a professional, learn how to hold a fucking key.

944
01:25:55,633 --> 01:25:55,973
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow.

945
01:25:57,194 --> 01:25:57,594
[SPEAKER_15]: I know.

946
01:25:58,035 --> 01:26:01,957
[SPEAKER_15]: He falls, this guy falls into the same category as Politary.

947
01:26:02,378 --> 01:26:04,159
[SPEAKER_15]: Cannot hold a key.

948
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:05,340
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay?

949
01:26:06,381 --> 01:26:12,225
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, the music was good, but the guy's voice sucked ass, so I'll split the difference and give it a six.

950
01:26:12,785 --> 01:26:14,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's go around to the other side.

951
01:26:15,467 --> 01:26:16,028
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, Loki.

952
01:26:16,048 --> 01:26:16,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

953
01:26:18,584 --> 01:26:21,125
[SPEAKER_05]: It gets a 10 because I've been playing this song for over a month.

954
01:26:22,325 --> 01:26:24,585
[SPEAKER_24]: And if it's that good for me to listen to, then it gets a 10.

955
01:26:26,406 --> 01:26:28,446
[SPEAKER_24]: And he does hold a key, he holds goth key.

956
01:26:28,686 --> 01:26:31,127
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's goth key, I guess.

957
01:26:34,888 --> 01:26:36,088
[SPEAKER_05]: The voice doesn't really bother me.

958
01:26:36,488 --> 01:26:37,448
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's cool.

959
01:26:37,888 --> 01:26:39,088
[SPEAKER_05]: And I like the music a lot.

960
01:26:39,208 --> 01:26:40,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's give it a 9 from me.

961
01:26:41,209 --> 01:26:41,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Angel.

962
01:26:43,638 --> 01:26:44,958
[SPEAKER_13]: I like his stuff a lot.

963
01:26:45,538 --> 01:26:47,339
[SPEAKER_13]: I had tonight.

964
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:53,060
[SPEAKER_05]: And let's see what we thought, Arcadian42.

965
01:26:53,140 --> 01:26:55,921
[SPEAKER_06]: It was okay, I'll give it 6.5.

966
01:26:56,621 --> 01:26:56,901
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

967
01:26:57,561 --> 01:27:01,262
[SPEAKER_05]: So remember, it's not up to us, it's up to you.

968
01:27:01,362 --> 01:27:05,223
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's review the songs you can vote for in tonight's cage match.

969
01:27:05,263 --> 01:27:10,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Starting off with song number one, last week's winner, Bitch by J-Punch.

970
01:27:23,579 --> 01:27:30,746
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, and song number two in tonight's cage match was Raiden 2, Airborne, Overclocked Mix.

971
01:27:41,997 --> 01:27:46,201
[SPEAKER_05]: And song number three in tonight's cage match was Monolithic, House of Joy.

972
01:27:56,395 --> 01:27:58,016
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, guys, you know the drill.

973
01:27:58,076 --> 01:28:00,117
[SPEAKER_05]: Place vote now.

974
01:28:00,237 --> 01:28:05,079
[SPEAKER_05]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.

975
01:28:06,019 --> 01:28:13,662
[SPEAKER_05]: Joining us late during the cage match, as he always likes to join us, say hello to Explicit, real name Jonas.

976
01:28:14,463 --> 01:28:14,903
[SPEAKER_17]: Hello.

977
01:28:15,103 --> 01:28:15,563
[SPEAKER_05]: How you doing?

978
01:28:16,463 --> 01:28:16,904
[SPEAKER_17]: Doing fine.

979
01:28:16,924 --> 01:28:18,944
[SPEAKER_17]: Just came back from the SVGL3 tournament.

980
01:28:18,984 --> 01:28:20,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, not just now, right?

981
01:28:20,305 --> 01:28:20,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Yesterday.

982
01:28:21,165 --> 01:28:23,926
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say, if you just got back now, you were there a little late.

983
01:28:23,966 --> 01:28:25,167
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what ended yesterday, right?

984
01:28:25,694 --> 01:28:26,154
[SPEAKER_17]: Dude, I was there.

985
01:28:26,174 --> 01:28:28,316
[SPEAKER_17]: I had to compete.

986
01:28:28,636 --> 01:28:29,116
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a note.

987
01:28:29,176 --> 01:28:29,857
[SPEAKER_05]: None of us went.

988
01:28:29,957 --> 01:28:33,039
[SPEAKER_05]: I was really hoping to go, but I got lazy.

989
01:28:33,679 --> 01:28:36,201
[SPEAKER_05]: And because of my trip, I got really badly burned out.

990
01:28:36,501 --> 01:28:37,642
[SPEAKER_05]: But nobody noticed I was gone.

991
01:28:37,702 --> 01:28:43,246
[SPEAKER_17]: But at the same time, just keep in mind that the hype wasn't really worth all that hype.

992
01:28:43,386 --> 01:28:43,626
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

993
01:28:43,806 --> 01:28:45,147
[SPEAKER_04]: When you talk about the hype, what do you mean?

994
01:28:45,727 --> 01:28:50,130
[SPEAKER_17]: You know how everybody says, oh, it's SVGL, the biggest tournament in history.

995
01:28:50,150 --> 01:28:51,691
[SPEAKER_17]: You got SVGL.

996
01:28:51,731 --> 01:28:53,413
[SPEAKER_17]: I think, when was the first SVGL?

997
01:28:53,433 --> 01:28:53,853
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you remember?

998
01:28:53,873 --> 01:28:53,953
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

999
01:28:55,697 --> 01:28:59,759
[SPEAKER_04]: First SVGL was, I don't know, a long time ago.

1000
01:28:59,779 --> 01:29:06,302
[SPEAKER_17]: I know SVGL 2 was 2002, in April, I suppose.

1001
01:29:07,242 --> 01:29:11,364
[SPEAKER_17]: And SVGL is December 2004, the third installment.

1002
01:29:11,564 --> 01:29:15,686
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was the last in a long line of events then.

1003
01:29:15,866 --> 01:29:18,667
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, supposedly the biggest tournament ever.

1004
01:29:19,408 --> 01:29:19,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1005
01:29:21,028 --> 01:29:22,329
[SPEAKER_17]: Depending on how people's opinions are.

1006
01:29:24,482 --> 01:29:33,430
[SPEAKER_17]: But all I gotta say is the big, well I'll explain later if you have any questions Not so far, I'm curious kind of what happened, how did the day go?

1007
01:29:34,832 --> 01:29:47,383
[SPEAKER_17]: Well it was a very very long day, the PA took, PA really I think started at 11.45 for the qualifiers I think the PA ended at 6 o'clock itself, it took that long

1008
01:29:49,161 --> 01:29:52,263
[SPEAKER_17]: because there was some controversy with the pads.

1009
01:29:52,283 --> 01:29:53,003
[SPEAKER_17]: Some people were complaining.

1010
01:29:53,023 --> 01:29:54,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, what is this controversy?

1011
01:29:54,123 --> 01:29:58,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I've heard about it over on DDR Freak, on the forums.

1012
01:29:58,345 --> 01:30:08,090
[SPEAKER_17]: They said, because they switched, I think they switched the pads from 4th Plus or into Groove, whatever they switched the cabinet to for the Extreme.

1013
01:30:09,111 --> 01:30:13,273
[SPEAKER_17]: And they said that one player's side is not working or I'm not really sure what's going on there.

1014
01:30:13,973 --> 01:30:15,994
[SPEAKER_17]: Someone said that this guy was a sore loser or...

1015
01:30:16,978 --> 01:30:21,302
[SPEAKER_17]: The pads were really not working, depending on what you guys' opinions or different playstyles.

1016
01:30:21,963 --> 01:30:25,185
[SPEAKER_17]: I can't really opinionize on that, but it delayed a shitload of time.

1017
01:30:25,926 --> 01:30:26,467
[SPEAKER_17]: Unnecessary.

1018
01:30:27,147 --> 01:30:36,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, I've noticed this is kind of a trend in a lot of tournaments lately, where somebody's complaining about the pad, and then they have to do these extensive tests on it to see if they're working or not.

1019
01:30:37,316 --> 01:30:40,319
[SPEAKER_05]: My advice to future people who are going to be throwing tournaments...

1020
01:30:41,359 --> 01:30:52,410
[SPEAKER_05]: to have some kind of conflict resolution thing in the tournament rules that says, if there's a question, this is the procedure, and whatever the outcome of that procedure is, end of story.

1021
01:30:52,470 --> 01:30:52,990
[SPEAKER_05]: No arguing.

1022
01:30:53,711 --> 01:31:01,618
[SPEAKER_17]: I really learned a lot with the SVGL3 tournament organizing, even though many have actually said that it was very badly organized.

1023
01:31:02,279 --> 01:31:05,522
[SPEAKER_17]: Regardless if it's true or not, I would say it's badly organized because of the

1024
01:31:06,164 --> 01:31:07,104
[SPEAKER_17]: Time restraints.

1025
01:31:07,864 --> 01:31:12,226
[SPEAKER_17]: I think 2DX took way too long, even though there was like 5 people who competed for 2DX.

1026
01:31:13,246 --> 01:31:14,326
[SPEAKER_04]: The only 5 people?

1027
01:31:14,886 --> 01:31:15,706
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, 2DX for it.

1028
01:31:15,766 --> 01:31:19,947
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm assuming 5 or 8, but it took way too long for its own type.

1029
01:31:20,648 --> 01:31:22,668
[SPEAKER_17]: Usually that's too fast for 8 people.

1030
01:31:24,189 --> 01:31:26,489
[SPEAKER_17]: But if it was like 32, it would take long, obviously.

1031
01:31:27,509 --> 01:31:29,230
[SPEAKER_17]: But yeah, around that much competed.

1032
01:31:30,030 --> 01:31:30,850
[SPEAKER_17]: It wasn't that many people.

1033
01:31:32,331 --> 01:31:33,751
[SPEAKER_17]: And freestyle started hella late.

1034
01:31:35,013 --> 01:31:38,294
[SPEAKER_17]: Not to mention the lack of room for people to actually compete on.

1035
01:31:38,354 --> 01:31:39,555
[SPEAKER_17]: It was too crowded inside.

1036
01:31:40,335 --> 01:31:42,195
[SPEAKER_17]: People had to sit down for the camera.

1037
01:31:42,595 --> 01:31:45,896
[SPEAKER_17]: It was all stuffed near the machines that have a lot of sound.

1038
01:31:46,377 --> 01:31:48,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Spiegel is a very interesting place to have a tournament.

1039
01:31:48,537 --> 01:31:49,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Do they have the machine inside?

1040
01:31:50,498 --> 01:31:50,838
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

1041
01:31:50,898 --> 01:31:52,659
[SPEAKER_17]: How in the hell were you able to see anything?

1042
01:31:53,039 --> 01:31:55,239
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, like I said, it wasn't really worth the hype.

1043
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:56,480
[SPEAKER_17]: I see.

1044
01:31:56,860 --> 01:31:59,841
[SPEAKER_17]: Because the management itself is also involved.

1045
01:32:00,281 --> 01:32:03,342
[SPEAKER_17]: They refuse to do certain things and certain expectations to...

1046
01:32:04,835 --> 01:32:05,875
[SPEAKER_17]: to us competitors.

1047
01:32:07,656 --> 01:32:14,418
[SPEAKER_17]: One is, yeah, of course, not everybody is satisfied, but at least come to a point where everybody agrees in a way.

1048
01:32:16,138 --> 01:32:17,619
[SPEAKER_17]: I know Team Seattle was there.

1049
01:32:17,799 --> 01:32:18,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, I heard about that.

1050
01:32:18,679 --> 01:32:19,679
[SPEAKER_17]: SoCal was there.

1051
01:32:20,059 --> 01:32:22,200
[SPEAKER_17]: Some of the Sacramento people were there, like Toadie.

1052
01:32:22,240 --> 01:32:26,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I was kind of hoping he'd come tonight because I wanted to talk to him about it because he competed.

1053
01:32:26,081 --> 01:32:28,842
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, and I competed.

1054
01:32:28,862 --> 01:32:28,922
[SPEAKER_17]: Ugh.

1055
01:32:31,999 --> 01:32:33,380
[SPEAKER_05]: What was that arc for?

1056
01:32:33,640 --> 01:32:58,816
[SPEAKER_17]: Because the rules kind of got altered in a way, I wasn't really sure if that was the rules because there was a qualifier list in SVGL3 I'm assuming, many people have thought it was going to be practicing one of the following songs like Highs Off You, Superstar, etc, etc, etc But I chose one of the, all of the things called Extratuned Some people may have fucked up on it, well I fucked up on it For some reason, it's not one of my greats in the beginning

1057
01:32:59,435 --> 01:33:03,696
[SPEAKER_17]: Some people were okay with that, but some people were not really happy with the rules there.

1058
01:33:05,017 --> 01:33:06,277
[SPEAKER_17]: But then again, it's a competition.

1059
01:33:06,297 --> 01:33:07,397
[SPEAKER_17]: You don't want to start drama.

1060
01:33:07,797 --> 01:33:11,599
[SPEAKER_17]: Do the drama during the forums, but not during the tournaments.

1061
01:33:11,839 --> 01:33:14,740
[SPEAKER_17]: That's where the forums come in the after to see what they can do better.

1062
01:33:16,020 --> 01:33:19,601
[SPEAKER_17]: Even though 50% of the control is basically on SVGL's part.

1063
01:33:21,380 --> 01:33:22,181
[SPEAKER_05]: So how did freestyle go?

1064
01:33:22,221 --> 01:33:25,743
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard freestyle was really good, that there were a lot of really high-level people.

1065
01:33:25,763 --> 01:33:27,884
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I can't really opinionize that.

1066
01:33:27,904 --> 01:33:31,146
[SPEAKER_17]: There were some ups and downs with freestyle.

1067
01:33:31,526 --> 01:33:35,529
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, the ups was it was a good competition, great competition, great competitors competed.

1068
01:33:35,809 --> 01:33:44,014
[SPEAKER_17]: Like Tequila from Omaha came all the way from there to the Bay just to compete.

1069
01:33:44,874 --> 01:33:48,777
[SPEAKER_17]: Turned out very good, and some of the performances showed a lot of hard work.

1070
01:33:49,177 --> 01:33:49,377
[SPEAKER_17]: Mm-hmm.

1071
01:33:50,943 --> 01:33:58,470
[SPEAKER_17]: In a way, especially with finals, why the hell are you going to place a fucking tournament right after college finals?

1072
01:33:59,110 --> 01:34:02,113
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, because they don't want to do it on Christmas.

1073
01:34:02,233 --> 01:34:06,997
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you could find a problem with almost any week that you could possibly pick, I think.

1074
01:34:07,497 --> 01:34:14,603
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, because I thought SVGL was supposed to be held during the summer, which was a predicted thing, but Christmas?

1075
01:34:14,983 --> 01:34:18,086
[SPEAKER_17]: Like, right before Christmas, it's finals, people are stressing out over it.

1076
01:34:18,581 --> 01:34:47,326
[SPEAKER_17]: Freestyle section, they can't do a routine because because freestyle in my opinion was too limited for that whole day because right after finals you have to work on a routine it's a big pain in the ass especially when I had finals like two or some people had finals like two like two of them on Friday and they had to work immediate without sleep just to make sure it looks good but the biggest problem with the the environment of the freestyle is that they didn't put outside

1077
01:34:47,881 --> 01:35:10,270
[SPEAKER_17]: Give a lot of air conditioning And of course the place itself wasn't even air conditioned And the second of all, very limited space You got people crowding all over the pad So people wanted to do a lot of movement outside the pad But they were limited because they got people around Blocking their... Even my routine got fucked over How so?

1078
01:35:10,950 --> 01:35:17,533
[SPEAKER_17]: Because it required at least 3 to 5 feet of open space on my right side When I was competing

1079
01:35:18,101 --> 01:35:26,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, was it supposedly going to happen that there was going to be the machine outside?

1080
01:35:26,567 --> 01:35:28,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Was that ever said that was possible?

1081
01:35:28,929 --> 01:35:33,492
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, SPGL2 had... Yeah, but I can see where in the winter there might be rain concerns, too.

1082
01:35:33,653 --> 01:35:37,515
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, because then imagine if it had rained and they tried to put the machine outside, it would have been even more cramped.

1083
01:35:38,456 --> 01:35:42,679
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I mean, the weather itself was not to a point where it was about to rain.

1084
01:35:44,864 --> 01:35:48,505
[SPEAKER_17]: Besides, I already checked the weather and SVGL beforehand so I know what the hell's going on.

1085
01:35:48,625 --> 01:35:48,845
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

1086
01:35:49,165 --> 01:35:52,546
[SPEAKER_17]: Even though, of course, the weather is not really 100% accurate.

1087
01:35:53,427 --> 01:35:58,468
[SPEAKER_17]: But at the same time... But here's another problem with the situation with the freestyle conditions.

1088
01:35:59,708 --> 01:36:02,969
[SPEAKER_17]: You got extreme near the 4th Plus machine.

1089
01:36:03,690 --> 01:36:09,411
[SPEAKER_17]: So you're either going to probably be hearing extreme songs and 4th Plus at the same time conflicting with your concentration on the routine.

1090
01:36:09,491 --> 01:36:09,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, ouch.

1091
01:36:10,312 --> 01:36:10,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1092
01:36:10,632 --> 01:36:14,493
[SPEAKER_17]: So you might be hearing like... They didn't turn one off or anything?

1093
01:36:15,495 --> 01:36:21,360
[SPEAKER_17]: No, for some reason the extreme was a little louder than, um, friggin', um... Fourth Plus?

1094
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:24,262
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, and you got the 2DX written almost nearby, too.

1095
01:36:24,362 --> 01:36:25,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Was In The Groove involved, too?

1096
01:36:26,024 --> 01:36:29,527
[SPEAKER_17]: No, no, the In The Groove machine got switched with Fourth Plus.

1097
01:36:29,967 --> 01:36:31,228
[SPEAKER_05]: Gotcha, okay, gotcha.

1098
01:36:31,368 --> 01:36:38,554
[SPEAKER_17]: So you got... Yeah, regardless, I still have not played In The Groove, so I can't really opinionize with these steps on In The Groove.

1099
01:36:39,095 --> 01:36:41,297
[SPEAKER_05]: That would have been interesting, though, if that was, uh...

1100
01:36:42,410 --> 01:36:44,653
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1101
01:36:55,546 --> 01:36:56,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah.

1102
01:36:56,587 --> 01:36:57,528
[SPEAKER_17]: That's controversial.

1103
01:36:57,548 --> 01:36:59,829
[SPEAKER_17]: I can't really say anything because I've never tested the thing.

1104
01:37:00,090 --> 01:37:00,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1105
01:37:00,510 --> 01:37:01,971
[SPEAKER_17]: And of course, everything's a matter of opinion.

1106
01:37:02,131 --> 01:37:07,135
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of surprised nobody took that opportunity, though, to do something with in the groove.

1107
01:37:07,475 --> 01:37:10,658
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of, I don't know, like having to pick the West Coast.

1108
01:37:11,358 --> 01:37:12,119
[SPEAKER_17]: They only have two cabinets.

1109
01:37:12,219 --> 01:37:13,220
[SPEAKER_17]: They only have two cabinets.

1110
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:20,526
[SPEAKER_17]: And of course, like, you got SVGL, CVGL, RV, not RVGL, well, sort of the way RVGL, MGL.

1111
01:37:20,546 --> 01:37:22,327
[SPEAKER_17]: They're all golfers.

1112
01:37:22,347 --> 01:37:23,968
[SPEAKER_17]: They have to share machines with each other in a way.

1113
01:37:24,008 --> 01:37:24,208
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

1114
01:37:24,769 --> 01:37:24,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1115
01:37:25,137 --> 01:37:36,205
[SPEAKER_17]: Especially in the barrier, which is very... Of course, you know, like, MGL got the Pump It Up Exceed from SVGL and probably in the groove from SVGL.

1116
01:37:36,265 --> 01:37:38,206
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not really sure if that's true or not.

1117
01:37:39,587 --> 01:37:42,469
[SPEAKER_17]: Or if both places have this in the groove.

1118
01:37:44,190 --> 01:37:44,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

1119
01:37:45,391 --> 01:37:46,292
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, let's see.

1120
01:37:46,632 --> 01:37:49,934
[SPEAKER_17]: 2DX... Oh, did you want to hear about the results?

1121
01:37:49,994 --> 01:37:52,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, what happened with the 2DX turning?

1122
01:37:52,616 --> 01:37:53,677
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I really didn't really...

1123
01:37:54,417 --> 01:38:01,262
[SPEAKER_17]: See what's with 2DX, but I've heard that a lot of people complaining about how 2DX Red was off-sync as shit.

1124
01:38:03,284 --> 01:38:05,346
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, it's like, think of it as night style.

1125
01:38:05,666 --> 01:38:09,829
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm not sure if it's not... That's what the fucking game is, they gotta get used to it.

1126
01:38:11,130 --> 01:38:12,211
[SPEAKER_17]: They're off-sync.

1127
01:38:12,812 --> 01:38:15,714
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I'm not sure if it's that, or if it's the hardware, I'm not sure, cause...

1128
01:38:16,724 --> 01:38:17,644
[SPEAKER_17]: Some people were complaining with that.

1129
01:38:18,044 --> 01:38:18,985
[SPEAKER_17]: I really couldn't complain.

1130
01:38:19,065 --> 01:38:26,506
[SPEAKER_17]: Either I had the worst accuracy or on 2DX, because I played myself, and I got a good attack the whole song.

1131
01:38:27,187 --> 01:38:28,607
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is on a red, was it on a red?

1132
01:38:28,627 --> 01:38:28,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Red.

1133
01:38:29,067 --> 01:38:29,487
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wow.

1134
01:38:29,607 --> 01:38:32,048
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, the new red Deliver Style.

1135
01:38:32,748 --> 01:38:33,288
[SPEAKER_17]: Wow.

1136
01:38:33,808 --> 01:38:34,968
[SPEAKER_17]: Drool, get a boner.

1137
01:38:36,869 --> 01:38:45,031
[SPEAKER_17]: But I'm not sure if it's really, but since RVGL's getting one, I'm not sure if that's going to be, if it's the hardware problems that people are saying or the software problems itself.

1138
01:38:45,231 --> 01:38:45,411
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

1139
01:38:46,859 --> 01:38:51,072
[SPEAKER_17]: Only time will tell what's the truth if it's off.

1140
01:38:53,599 --> 01:38:56,440
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there any questions with the FBGL tournament?

1141
01:38:56,580 --> 01:38:57,240
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1142
01:38:57,740 --> 01:38:59,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing I haven't gotten on there and read myself.

1143
01:38:59,401 --> 01:39:03,022
[SPEAKER_05]: I just kind of feel bad that I wasn't really able to go to the tournament because I really wanted to go.

1144
01:39:03,062 --> 01:39:06,743
[SPEAKER_05]: But then at the same time, it sounded like it was really crowded as hell and not a lot of standing room.

1145
01:39:06,823 --> 01:39:12,564
[SPEAKER_17]: And if I wasn't entering, maybe... Well, there was some drama involved as well.

1146
01:39:13,184 --> 01:39:13,825
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the drama?

1147
01:39:13,845 --> 01:39:14,485
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell us about drama.

1148
01:39:16,105 --> 01:39:17,426
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll get to the FBs on that one.

1149
01:39:17,606 --> 01:39:17,946
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.

1150
01:39:17,986 --> 01:39:18,466
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to know now.

1151
01:39:19,709 --> 01:39:23,512
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1152
01:39:38,806 --> 01:39:40,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well, how old is DDR Bot?

1153
01:39:41,067 --> 01:39:41,708
[SPEAKER_17]: He's 11 years old.

1154
01:39:44,710 --> 01:39:48,192
[SPEAKER_05]: So, basically, he's resorting to an 11-year-old's immaturity to pick on the 11-year-old.

1155
01:39:48,872 --> 01:39:49,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Just curious, all right?

1156
01:39:49,633 --> 01:39:50,914
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, well, yeah, you got that.

1157
01:39:51,014 --> 01:39:51,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, okay.

1158
01:39:52,875 --> 01:39:53,575
[SPEAKER_05]: Birds of a feather.

1159
01:39:54,156 --> 01:40:00,039
[SPEAKER_17]: Of course you got the complaints of the pads, whether or not it's SVGL sport or if it's the people being so loser.

1160
01:40:00,159 --> 01:40:00,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Who started it?

1161
01:40:02,641 --> 01:40:03,661
[SPEAKER_17]: I can't get involved.

1162
01:40:03,962 --> 01:40:04,522
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, all right.

1163
01:40:05,163 --> 01:40:08,444
[SPEAKER_17]: Some people drooling over DDR Player's girlfriend.

1164
01:40:08,824 --> 01:40:11,645
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to ask the hard-hitting questions of this program, alright?

1165
01:40:11,685 --> 01:40:13,565
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to know, who started this shit?

1166
01:40:13,805 --> 01:40:15,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Who cast the first stone?

1167
01:40:15,826 --> 01:40:17,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's the drama starter?

1168
01:40:17,186 --> 01:40:19,146
[SPEAKER_17]: Who is their fan in the flames?

1169
01:40:20,327 --> 01:40:26,148
[SPEAKER_17]: I can't really... I don't really know exactly, but it has something to do with SoCal and Team Seattle.

1170
01:40:27,839 --> 01:40:34,966
[SPEAKER_05]: which is a long going back and forth that's happened for a long, long time so that's again, not a surprise, alright.

1171
01:40:35,467 --> 01:40:43,194
[SPEAKER_17]: Err, I'm not sure what happened but they said it was JSP versus some girl in Team Seattle, JSP won that one but for some reason he dropped out of the race.

1172
01:40:45,036 --> 01:40:52,143
[SPEAKER_17]: For either attraction or sexually attractive reasons or

1173
01:40:52,543 --> 01:40:59,206
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it Tanya, the girl that's always on, because I know she was going, the girl that was the get up move girl?

1174
01:40:59,786 --> 01:41:00,526
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm not really sure.

1175
01:41:01,107 --> 01:41:02,427
[SPEAKER_24]: If I remember correctly reading this.

1176
01:41:02,607 --> 01:41:04,068
[SPEAKER_24]: I read this briefly, I think.

1177
01:41:04,128 --> 01:41:07,689
[SPEAKER_24]: It was the chick that was the one that was on MTV promoting DDR.

1178
01:41:07,829 --> 01:41:10,250
[SPEAKER_24]: I didn't know there was anyone on MTV promoting DDR.

1179
01:41:10,270 --> 01:41:10,730
[SPEAKER_05]: What the hell?

1180
01:41:10,750 --> 01:41:11,831
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't even know about that.

1181
01:41:11,891 --> 01:41:17,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, actually, Tanya was on the, what is it, the 20 games of the year thing or something.

1182
01:41:17,733 --> 01:41:19,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, I've heard about that.

1183
01:41:19,294 --> 01:41:20,715
[SPEAKER_05]: They shot stuff around Seattle.

1184
01:41:20,755 --> 01:41:21,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, okay, so...

1185
01:41:21,795 --> 01:41:22,595
[SPEAKER_17]: I heard about that.

1186
01:41:22,795 --> 01:41:23,576
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so.

1187
01:41:24,096 --> 01:41:29,278
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh yeah, for the winners of PEA, one of the first places, of course, Team Seattle.

1188
01:41:30,298 --> 01:41:35,120
[SPEAKER_17]: Second was Fidox, who actually came to the FU tournament and the August.

1189
01:41:35,280 --> 01:41:35,981
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, good deal.

1190
01:41:36,201 --> 01:41:37,041
[SPEAKER_17]: So that was very good.

1191
01:41:38,422 --> 01:41:41,963
[SPEAKER_17]: Third place, I don't remember third place, but I know the top two.

1192
01:41:42,063 --> 01:41:42,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, back to drama.

1193
01:41:42,983 --> 01:41:44,264
[SPEAKER_05]: Was there any good freestyle drama?

1194
01:41:46,297 --> 01:41:47,538
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, the limited room of space.

1195
01:41:47,558 --> 01:41:49,360
[SPEAKER_17]: Of course, I already told you about the freestyle drama.

1196
01:41:50,060 --> 01:41:52,162
[SPEAKER_17]: The limited amount of room of space.

1197
01:41:52,282 --> 01:41:54,084
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to know, I have to know.

1198
01:41:54,444 --> 01:41:55,545
[SPEAKER_05]: Did anybody get served?

1199
01:41:57,386 --> 01:41:57,847
[SPEAKER_17]: In what way?

1200
01:41:59,728 --> 01:42:02,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Did anybody do their routine and go, you got served?

1201
01:42:02,811 --> 01:42:03,011
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1202
01:42:03,672 --> 01:42:04,392
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody got served?

1203
01:42:05,213 --> 01:42:05,453
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

1204
01:42:05,994 --> 01:42:06,434
[SPEAKER_05]: I had to know.

1205
01:42:06,474 --> 01:42:08,876
[SPEAKER_17]: Because people were just waiting for freestyle to start.

1206
01:42:08,896 --> 01:42:11,879
[SPEAKER_17]: It took too long for everybody else to fucking...

1207
01:42:12,762 --> 01:42:13,543
[SPEAKER_17]: Get freestyle prepared.

1208
01:42:13,583 --> 01:42:14,083
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it started at 8.30.

1209
01:42:14,323 --> 01:42:15,404
[SPEAKER_17]: That was too late.

1210
01:42:15,424 --> 01:42:16,345
[SPEAKER_17]: Everybody's tired.

1211
01:42:16,465 --> 01:42:16,845
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, shit.

1212
01:42:16,885 --> 01:42:19,327
[SPEAKER_17]: I could have gone to Spiggle if I knew it was going to go that way.

1213
01:42:20,168 --> 01:42:21,248
[SPEAKER_17]: But at the same time, though.

1214
01:42:21,268 --> 01:42:26,032
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, the condition, it was too... It was just too hot inside and limited space.

1215
01:42:26,132 --> 01:42:27,173
[SPEAKER_17]: You can't really do anything.

1216
01:42:27,593 --> 01:42:34,438
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like pointing your fingers upwards, just not moving your whole body and taking advantage of the whole freestyle.

1217
01:42:34,658 --> 01:42:35,699
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, were there any fistfights?

1218
01:42:36,740 --> 01:42:37,701
[SPEAKER_17]: No, there were no... Shouting matches?

1219
01:42:38,061 --> 01:42:38,221
[SPEAKER_17]: Huh?

1220
01:42:38,861 --> 01:42:39,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Knives drawn?

1221
01:42:39,462 --> 01:42:39,502
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1222
01:42:40,598 --> 01:42:41,639
[SPEAKER_17]: No, no, no.

1223
01:42:41,819 --> 01:42:42,880
[SPEAKER_17]: But I heard... Oh, yeah.

1224
01:42:43,460 --> 01:42:45,522
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, I was just reading the forum.

1225
01:42:45,562 --> 01:42:47,604
[SPEAKER_17]: Some people are saying, damn Fab Five.

1226
01:42:47,664 --> 01:42:52,888
[SPEAKER_17]: It does have something to do with throwing a football at an 11-year-old's head.

1227
01:42:52,928 --> 01:42:54,089
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, Fab Five?

1228
01:42:54,769 --> 01:43:01,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Carson and Tom and Gann and all them were there?

1229
01:43:01,415 --> 01:43:02,435
[SPEAKER_05]: They're my idols, man.

1230
01:43:02,475 --> 01:43:05,278
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not sure what the hell is going on with this drama and shit.

1231
01:43:06,118 --> 01:43:07,980
[SPEAKER_17]: But, you know, this drama exists and...

1232
01:43:09,223 --> 01:43:14,406
[SPEAKER_05]: And people are serving other people and it's just, you know, servolution.

1233
01:43:14,526 --> 01:43:19,768
[SPEAKER_17]: Then you got boyfriend-girlfriend conflicts with other men or other women, whatever the hell you say it's.

1234
01:43:20,829 --> 01:43:24,651
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, this should be interesting because one of the, I think one of the NorCal people,

1235
01:43:25,831 --> 01:43:26,852
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll say, where is this?

1236
01:43:27,412 --> 01:43:30,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-uh, uh-uh, okay, uh-uh, no, uh-uh, uh-uh.

1237
01:43:30,755 --> 01:43:33,697
[SPEAKER_03]: He is not sleeping with my boyfriend, okay?

1238
01:43:33,837 --> 01:43:35,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, now, uh-uh, it's not going to happen.

1239
01:43:35,838 --> 01:43:38,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'm going to serve you right now, okay?

1240
01:43:38,580 --> 01:43:39,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's the thing.

1241
01:43:39,720 --> 01:43:40,281
[SPEAKER_03]: How was that?

1242
01:43:40,781 --> 01:43:41,121
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

1243
01:43:41,181 --> 01:43:44,203
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, what's funny is that... That was my, like, Texas slash ghetto.

1244
01:43:44,384 --> 01:43:45,484
[SPEAKER_05]: It was my Texas ghetto.

1245
01:43:46,885 --> 01:43:51,068
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't understand this drama, but this is one of the funniest questions I've ever... One of the funniest questions...

1246
01:43:51,701 --> 01:43:56,646
[SPEAKER_17]: I've been asked to me, why is this hot Asian girl going out with old Joe Dirt?

1247
01:43:58,888 --> 01:44:03,933
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think this one guy actually liked this... Did anyone actually see the movie Joe Dirt?

1248
01:44:05,274 --> 01:44:07,977
[SPEAKER_24]: There's a hot chick dating Joe Dirt, I mean...

1249
01:44:10,077 --> 01:44:10,737
[SPEAKER_24]: What the hell?

1250
01:44:11,298 --> 01:44:15,980
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, that was a response I got from one of the people, saying, ooh, this girl is hot.

1251
01:44:16,440 --> 01:44:20,062
[SPEAKER_17]: See, I know something like this is gonna happen, so... Oh my god, he tricked the Asian!

1252
01:44:20,402 --> 01:44:21,503
[SPEAKER_24]: He must be super genius!

1253
01:44:23,404 --> 01:44:23,864
[SPEAKER_24]: Anyway, sorry.

1254
01:44:24,204 --> 01:44:26,605
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh yeah, and I did actually talk to some gay guy.

1255
01:44:26,785 --> 01:44:27,786
[SPEAKER_17]: An actual gay person.

1256
01:44:28,086 --> 01:44:28,526
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh my god!

1257
01:44:28,686 --> 01:44:30,427
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my god, they exist?

1258
01:44:30,947 --> 01:44:33,709
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait, you actually saw a gay person?

1259
01:44:34,109 --> 01:44:36,830
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, I've actually talked to a gay person in a tournament.

1260
01:44:37,610 --> 01:44:38,711
[SPEAKER_17]: He's like you, Robb.

1261
01:44:39,517 --> 01:44:39,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh dear.

1262
01:44:40,618 --> 01:44:43,040
[SPEAKER_24]: He's like you, Ron, but gay.

1263
01:44:43,500 --> 01:44:44,541
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, what, what, what, Loki?

1264
01:44:44,841 --> 01:44:45,942
[SPEAKER_24]: He's like you, Ron, but gay.

1265
01:44:48,144 --> 01:44:52,427
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not gay, I just... Whoa, whoa, whoa, I thought you... You just pull in on the radio.

1266
01:44:52,967 --> 01:44:54,969
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, this is just my radio personality, okay?

1267
01:44:55,489 --> 01:44:58,091
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, pussy, I'm all about the pussy, man.

1268
01:44:58,151 --> 01:45:00,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Tips, yeah, that's all I want right now.

1269
01:45:00,293 --> 01:45:05,077
[SPEAKER_05]: Big, big, big... I can't do it.

1270
01:45:05,577 --> 01:45:06,818
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gayer than Judy Garland.

1271
01:45:06,878 --> 01:45:08,079
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't hold it anymore.

1272
01:45:08,720 --> 01:45:11,021
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, perhaps you and that gay guy would have a good match.

1273
01:45:12,282 --> 01:45:15,103
[SPEAKER_05]: And if he plays DDR, he's probably under 18, so not a good idea.

1274
01:45:16,704 --> 01:45:19,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he's over 18, but I'm not sure if he plays DDR or anything like that.

1275
01:45:20,086 --> 01:45:22,007
[SPEAKER_05]: An actual, living, breathing gay person?

1276
01:45:22,727 --> 01:45:22,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1277
01:45:23,308 --> 01:45:23,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1278
01:45:23,888 --> 01:45:24,428
[SPEAKER_05]: Just curious.

1279
01:45:24,668 --> 01:45:24,989
Wait, wait, wait.

1280
01:45:25,409 --> 01:45:29,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, therefore, because I'm gay and this other person's gay, we have to have sex, obviously.

1281
01:45:31,492 --> 01:45:32,913
[SPEAKER_05]: Did they capture him in nets?

1282
01:45:33,433 --> 01:45:37,155
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, okay, because if one of the gays is running around, then, you know...

1283
01:45:38,140 --> 01:45:40,341
[SPEAKER_24]: You don't want that stuff spreading.

1284
01:45:40,401 --> 01:45:41,902
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, he does act gay.

1285
01:45:41,922 --> 01:45:43,063
[SPEAKER_17]: He actually says he was gay.

1286
01:45:44,284 --> 01:45:48,306
[SPEAKER_24]: He's like, as he's bent over some dude, yeah, I'm gay.

1287
01:45:52,408 --> 01:45:52,769
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, man.

1288
01:45:53,209 --> 01:45:53,449
[SPEAKER_24]: Sorry.

1289
01:45:53,469 --> 01:45:54,970
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's all right.

1290
01:45:55,890 --> 01:45:56,511
[SPEAKER_24]: But, yes.

1291
01:45:56,651 --> 01:46:00,513
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm glad you could finally meet a gay person.

1292
01:46:01,194 --> 01:46:02,154
[SPEAKER_05]: That's for you, Skye.

1293
01:46:02,614 --> 01:46:03,335
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, thank you.

1294
01:46:05,149 --> 01:46:06,629
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, moving on.

1295
01:46:06,669 --> 01:46:09,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go and talk about, because the chat room is getting restless.

1296
01:46:09,610 --> 01:46:14,492
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going... How long have they been having this conversation?

1297
01:46:15,352 --> 01:46:16,652
[SPEAKER_05]: No, Loki, I want to go to break.

1298
01:46:16,752 --> 01:46:18,033
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, yeah, where's SVGL?

1299
01:46:18,053 --> 01:46:19,073
[SPEAKER_17]: It's near MGL.

1300
01:46:19,193 --> 01:46:19,833
[SPEAKER_17]: Problem solved.

1301
01:46:21,173 --> 01:46:22,914
[SPEAKER_05]: SVGL is in the Bay Area.

1302
01:46:23,034 --> 01:46:24,414
[SPEAKER_05]: It's in southern Bay Area.

1303
01:46:24,434 --> 01:46:26,575
[SPEAKER_17]: Actually, it's a 20-minute drive or...

1304
01:46:28,656 --> 01:46:33,358
[SPEAKER_05]: If you know where MGL is, it's basically... If you don't know where it is, it's near San Jose, California, basically.

1305
01:46:33,618 --> 01:46:34,158
[SPEAKER_17]: It's simple.

1306
01:46:34,478 --> 01:46:36,979
[SPEAKER_05]: The easy... Because remember, we're an international program.

1307
01:46:36,999 --> 01:46:40,161
[SPEAKER_17]: Just drive three simple steps to drive to Milpitas.

1308
01:46:40,681 --> 01:46:47,904
[SPEAKER_17]: Go to I-80, then go to 680, then exit where you'll see... El Camino, Real.

1309
01:46:48,044 --> 01:46:49,925
[SPEAKER_17]: That's SVGL, talking about MGL.

1310
01:46:51,646 --> 01:46:53,787
[SPEAKER_17]: SVGL takes a little longer to get to, though.

1311
01:46:54,467 --> 01:46:55,428
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's gay people there.

1312
01:46:56,690 --> 01:46:56,950
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1313
01:46:58,211 --> 01:47:05,053
[SPEAKER_05]: Just start, you know what, just get in your car and start driving towards the Madonna music and you'll end up in Spiegel soon enough.

1314
01:47:05,553 --> 01:47:08,274
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll see the giant rainbow sign in the air.

1315
01:47:10,175 --> 01:47:11,135
[SPEAKER_05]: You know they're all tagged.

1316
01:47:14,296 --> 01:47:17,878
[SPEAKER_15]: And they've got like, you know those tags like pierced on their ears.

1317
01:47:19,658 --> 01:47:24,020
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright you bitches, let's hear who won tonight's cage match, shall we?

1318
01:47:25,399 --> 01:47:26,500
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to take a break.

1319
01:47:48,018 --> 01:47:49,080
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to go to a break right now.

1320
01:47:50,382 --> 01:47:53,646
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though I couldn't find half the songs you wanted to hear in the next break, I did find one.

1321
01:47:53,746 --> 01:47:54,788
[SPEAKER_25]: You found Panorama?

1322
01:47:54,828 --> 01:47:55,729
[SPEAKER_05]: I did find Panorama.

1323
01:47:56,030 --> 01:47:56,310
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

1324
01:47:56,410 --> 01:47:56,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, here it is.

1325
01:47:57,191 --> 01:47:57,632
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be back.

1326
01:48:46,348 --> 01:48:48,233
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for watching!

1327
01:49:09,665 --> 01:49:11,210
Thanks for watching!

1328
01:52:55,161 --> 01:53:02,647
[SPEAKER_11]: All that you wish for is to have you Fly and keep on

1329
01:53:48,446 --> 01:53:50,108
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, this is Mel B of RTF.

1330
01:53:50,449 --> 01:53:55,315
[SPEAKER_01]: And for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join us on all the fun together.

1331
01:53:56,175 --> 01:54:02,160
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, if you're a broke ass like I am, why don't you come to one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.

1332
01:54:02,480 --> 01:54:04,382
[SPEAKER_12]: It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.

1333
01:54:04,963 --> 01:54:09,046
[SPEAKER_12]: Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.

1334
01:54:09,787 --> 01:54:11,288
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello, we are back.

1335
01:54:12,049 --> 01:54:15,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Mel won that freestyle thing with tequila, right?

1336
01:54:15,091 --> 01:54:15,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Was that it?

1337
01:54:15,491 --> 01:54:16,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that how it went?

1338
01:54:16,584 --> 01:54:18,305
[SPEAKER_05]: The Freestyle over at Sigl.

1339
01:54:18,725 --> 01:54:19,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Mel and Tequila?

1340
01:54:20,025 --> 01:54:21,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Mel and Tequila, yeah, they won it.

1341
01:54:21,446 --> 01:54:22,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Good job, boys.

1342
01:54:22,386 --> 01:54:22,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Good job.

1343
01:54:22,646 --> 01:54:24,146
[SPEAKER_17]: Yep, did a very, very good job.

1344
01:54:24,226 --> 01:54:30,288
[SPEAKER_17]: It's all worth Tequila's drive and Mel's... He drove from... No, I'm not sure, but I think it's by flight.

1345
01:54:30,308 --> 01:54:31,549
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say, that's a hell of a drive.

1346
01:54:31,569 --> 01:54:31,869
[SPEAKER_05]: By flight.

1347
01:54:32,449 --> 01:54:32,709
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1348
01:54:33,369 --> 01:54:35,910
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, you said you had some stuff you wanted to talk about tonight with us.

1349
01:54:36,150 --> 01:54:36,370
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1350
01:54:38,291 --> 01:54:41,352
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, now I want to talk to you because I noticed that you were doing something else.

1351
01:54:41,392 --> 01:54:43,872
[SPEAKER_05]: So, of course, I want to distract you from that other thing you were doing.

1352
01:54:44,352 --> 01:54:51,893
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to join our chatroom, www.orangeloungeradio.com Come complain about the cage match picks with everybody else there in our chatroom.

1353
01:54:53,494 --> 01:54:57,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, we also have mini-programming that goes on during the week.

1354
01:54:58,134 --> 01:55:00,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Monday nights, Diversion, the Orange Lounge Radio Remix show.

1355
01:55:00,595 --> 01:55:04,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Tuesday nights, Pump Up the Volume with the one and only DarkSakura.

1356
01:55:04,635 --> 01:55:04,856
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

1357
01:55:05,556 --> 01:55:07,436
[SPEAKER_05]: And Thursday nights, Outside the Box with me,

1358
01:55:09,671 --> 01:55:09,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Who?

1359
01:55:10,311 --> 01:55:10,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Me.

1360
01:55:11,392 --> 01:55:11,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Who?

1361
01:55:11,672 --> 01:55:11,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Me.

1362
01:55:12,073 --> 01:55:12,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Who?

1363
01:55:12,353 --> 01:55:12,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Myself.

1364
01:55:12,793 --> 01:55:13,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob and I. Rob.

1365
01:55:13,754 --> 01:55:13,954
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1366
01:55:14,034 --> 01:55:14,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob.

1367
01:55:14,234 --> 01:55:14,414
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1368
01:55:14,655 --> 01:55:14,835
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1369
01:55:14,955 --> 01:55:15,095
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1370
01:55:15,135 --> 01:55:15,275
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1371
01:55:15,295 --> 01:55:15,435
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1372
01:55:16,456 --> 01:55:26,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, and Friday night over on DDR Freak Radio, relive the magic of Orange Challenge Radio Sunday nights as DDR Freak Radio rebroadcasts our Sunday night program at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.

1373
01:55:27,584 --> 01:55:28,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, what's up?

1374
01:55:30,386 --> 01:55:33,028
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, um, sim stuff.

1375
01:55:33,849 --> 01:55:35,170
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, basically...

1376
01:55:36,328 --> 01:55:41,331
[SPEAKER_24]: DDR Maniacs has been down for a while now, so no new theme stuff.

1377
01:55:44,533 --> 01:55:51,077
[SPEAKER_24]: Anyways, there was a couple turnouts going on that I don't care about, but anyways.

1378
01:55:51,097 --> 01:55:55,520
[SPEAKER_24]: The first one that should be mentioned, well, I guess that would be the first one.

1379
01:55:56,158 --> 01:56:06,161
[SPEAKER_24]: Turnimix 5+, which is called the re-Turnimix, which I didn't really read the rules, but it sounds like it's just taking old songs from the Turnimix 1 through 5 and redoing them.

1380
01:56:06,301 --> 01:56:06,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Big deal.

1381
01:56:07,042 --> 01:56:08,242
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so that's going on right now.

1382
01:56:08,282 --> 01:56:09,542
[SPEAKER_05]: You can find all the information you want.

1383
01:56:11,403 --> 01:56:14,744
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so it's basically like the flashback episode of your favorite sitcom.

1384
01:56:14,784 --> 01:56:17,645
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the same old shit with a different laugh track.

1385
01:56:19,946 --> 01:56:20,366
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

1386
01:56:20,386 --> 01:56:20,466
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

1387
01:56:20,990 --> 01:56:21,750
[SPEAKER_24]: So there's that.

1388
01:56:21,810 --> 01:56:27,633
[SPEAKER_24]: Then there's DDR OSC 3+, the original Stepfile Contest.

1389
01:56:28,193 --> 01:56:29,534
[SPEAKER_24]: This is remixed, basically.

1390
01:56:30,595 --> 01:56:44,061
[SPEAKER_24]: The rules for this is it has to be a song, a remix of a song that's been used in DDR Tourney Mix, a remix of a song that's been used in OSC, or an overclocked remix that hasn't been used in either one, or an original...

1391
01:56:44,907 --> 01:56:48,808
[SPEAKER_24]: Remix of a song that's in a non-music game, you know, base game.

1392
01:56:48,948 --> 01:56:53,069
[SPEAKER_24]: So, no DDR remixes, but, you know, remixes of other crap is okay.

1393
01:56:54,109 --> 01:56:55,729
[SPEAKER_24]: And the due date for this is the 28th.

1394
01:56:56,449 --> 01:56:58,470
[SPEAKER_24]: All your information can be found on the MyStyle.

1395
01:56:58,510 --> 01:57:01,790
[SPEAKER_24]: There's links to the OSC homepage and all that wonderful crap.

1396
01:57:02,351 --> 01:57:06,831
[SPEAKER_24]: And, um, other than that, still stuff's being worked on for the, you know, the Sinfile releases.

1397
01:57:07,272 --> 01:57:14,613
[SPEAKER_24]: Now, one of the things I thought was funny that I'd like to mention was we've had our very first, very first, um,

1398
01:57:16,070 --> 01:57:16,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Circus de Soleil

1399
01:57:31,038 --> 01:57:33,099
[SPEAKER_24]: and then Cirque du Soleil.

1400
01:57:34,619 --> 01:57:35,559
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, my mistake.

1401
01:57:35,759 --> 01:57:51,963
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, anyways, they actually came after Bomani Stealth for having, I guess, some of their music on their site, which should be surprising because any of their music actually being out there on the internet, why the fuck anyone want to listen to it level and make a remix or a, not remix, a sim file for that?

1402
01:57:52,023 --> 01:57:52,343
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know.

1403
01:57:53,363 --> 01:57:55,884
[SPEAKER_04]: What I want to know is how the fuck did someone find that?

1404
01:57:57,438 --> 01:57:57,738
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know.

1405
01:57:58,118 --> 01:58:03,621
[SPEAKER_24]: Anyways, so they got the Seasoned Assist for that thing, but everything else is going as planned.

1406
01:58:03,641 --> 01:58:05,582
[SPEAKER_24]: But I just thought that was funny that that would be on there.

1407
01:58:06,562 --> 01:58:09,564
[SPEAKER_24]: Other than that, really nothing else going on.

1408
01:58:10,924 --> 01:58:19,408
[SPEAKER_24]: So just those two little tournaments there that we really don't have that much to notice for, and well, whatever.

1409
01:58:21,309 --> 01:58:23,911
[SPEAKER_05]: A comment in our chatroom I'd like some discussion on.

1410
01:58:24,291 --> 01:58:25,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Tournamix is shit.

1411
01:58:26,292 --> 01:58:26,692
[SPEAKER_05]: Disgust.

1412
01:58:28,755 --> 01:58:30,096
[SPEAKER_05]: I just really don't care anymore.

1413
01:58:30,396 --> 01:58:32,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody gives a shit.

1414
01:58:32,658 --> 01:58:33,459
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't even remember.

1415
01:58:34,300 --> 01:58:37,262
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't look at those as a good indicator.

1416
01:58:37,743 --> 01:58:40,205
[SPEAKER_24]: There really aren't that many quality sim files out there anymore.

1417
01:58:41,201 --> 01:58:43,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the problem, the pool is way too diluted.

1418
01:58:43,863 --> 01:58:46,805
[SPEAKER_04]: As you just said, I didn't follow any of that shit you just said, basically.

1419
01:58:46,865 --> 01:58:49,867
[SPEAKER_05]: All I heard was blah blah blah, another contest on blah blah blah, another site.

1420
01:58:50,347 --> 01:58:51,047
[SPEAKER_05]: With blah blah blah.

1421
01:58:51,267 --> 01:58:54,950
[SPEAKER_04]: And what the fuck, it's a contest based off of other contests, that's kind of weird to me, sorry.

1422
01:58:55,510 --> 01:59:01,634
[SPEAKER_04]: But, so basically you've got what, you've got tournaments, and then you have the EI tournament, and then you have this, and then that.

1423
01:59:02,114 --> 01:59:04,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody's got a freaking tournament going on right now.

1424
01:59:04,336 --> 01:59:07,458
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like how like two years ago when Extreme was kind of new.

1425
01:59:08,198 --> 01:59:10,379
[SPEAKER_05]: Every other week, there was a DDR tournament somewhere.

1426
01:59:10,419 --> 01:59:14,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I remember in NorCal, every week for a couple months, there was a tournament somewhere.

1427
01:59:15,002 --> 01:59:17,943
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was just like, people did not have the time to come up with freestyle routines.

1428
01:59:18,464 --> 01:59:19,384
[SPEAKER_05]: They didn't care anymore.

1429
01:59:19,864 --> 01:59:22,086
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I see the same thing happening here.

1430
01:59:22,966 --> 01:59:23,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's my problem.

1431
01:59:23,787 --> 01:59:26,048
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, and this is the biggest problem that I have with everything.

1432
01:59:26,928 --> 01:59:29,630
[SPEAKER_24]: Once FoodMix came out, that set the new standards for me.

1433
01:59:29,750 --> 01:59:30,670
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing can achieve it.

1434
01:59:30,750 --> 01:59:31,130
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

1435
01:59:31,351 --> 01:59:32,531
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just nothing has come close.

1436
01:59:32,891 --> 01:59:35,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing will come close until FoodMix releases something else.

1437
01:59:35,893 --> 01:59:36,633
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's it.

1438
01:59:36,814 --> 01:59:37,534
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know what?

1439
01:59:37,967 --> 01:59:44,353
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, but there's no Simphile creator out there that can even match that, or even come close to matching that.

1440
01:59:45,754 --> 01:59:48,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Even without the yippy hippy background movies.

1441
01:59:49,358 --> 01:59:52,400
[SPEAKER_05]: If you were to take the background movies out, would you still feel the same?

1442
01:59:52,781 --> 01:59:57,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I think background movies is a little much to ask some Joe Schmo in their basement to create.

1443
01:59:57,765 --> 02:00:02,330
[SPEAKER_05]: How the hell the Food Mix guys did it, hey, you know what, I don't know, they just had way too much free time.

1444
02:00:03,070 --> 02:00:04,131
[SPEAKER_17]: You're very talented, though.

1445
02:00:04,151 --> 02:00:06,872
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, that's really what... Don't get me wrong.

1446
02:00:07,552 --> 02:00:09,453
[SPEAKER_04]: The songs are great, and the steps are great.

1447
02:00:09,493 --> 02:00:10,374
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not arguing that.

1448
02:00:10,814 --> 02:00:13,915
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just saying, they've got it all.

1449
02:00:14,255 --> 02:00:17,937
[SPEAKER_05]: So, even if you were to remove the videos, would you still say that?

1450
02:00:18,177 --> 02:00:18,477
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1451
02:00:18,998 --> 02:00:23,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Even so, the artwork in the background is still phenomenal, and they created their own songs that didn't sound like shit.

1452
02:00:24,320 --> 02:00:25,441
[SPEAKER_24]: That was also really good.

1453
02:00:25,901 --> 02:00:28,342
[SPEAKER_24]: And the interface, the whole theme was awesome.

1454
02:00:28,732 --> 02:00:30,073
[SPEAKER_24]: Just everything about that was awesome.

1455
02:00:30,413 --> 02:00:33,194
[SPEAKER_24]: Now, as I see in the chat room, you know, how about the judging?

1456
02:00:33,494 --> 02:00:38,536
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, I've been saying it since, what, Tournament Mix, I don't know, 2, 3, 1, I don't know, it doesn't matter.

1457
02:00:39,377 --> 02:00:45,179
[SPEAKER_24]: I've been saying they cannot have these sim files labeled by who made them, because you'll never get fair judging for it.

1458
02:00:46,008 --> 02:00:48,810
[SPEAKER_24]: What do they do every time they fucking label who they're from?

1459
02:00:48,850 --> 02:00:51,732
[SPEAKER_24]: Then they're not voting on SimFile, they're voting for who their favorite person is.

1460
02:00:52,953 --> 02:01:01,439
[SPEAKER_05]: And everybody goes straight to download DM Ashura's file, and they go straight to download Moogle Hunter's file, and don't get me wrong, I love Moogle Hunter, he's a local guy, I love him.

1461
02:01:02,019 --> 02:01:10,826
[SPEAKER_05]: And what else, they go straight to download Bomani Ruler, Jesus Christ, and they go straight to download whatever, the big people in the SimScenes.

1462
02:01:11,386 --> 02:01:12,067
[SPEAKER_05]: And they win!

1463
02:01:12,447 --> 02:01:14,828
[SPEAKER_17]: Wait, actually, you can't say that about Moogle Hunter on Terminix 4?

1464
02:01:15,769 --> 02:01:16,510
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks for watching!

1465
02:01:35,752 --> 02:01:36,273
[SPEAKER_24]: No, they're not.

1466
02:01:36,453 --> 02:01:37,794
[SPEAKER_17]: No, they're not.

1467
02:01:38,414 --> 02:01:38,975
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I'm sorry.

1468
02:01:38,995 --> 02:01:41,317
[SPEAKER_17]: It gets gone to shit, basically.

1469
02:01:41,737 --> 02:01:46,521
[SPEAKER_17]: People just, like, not care, and they just, oh, let's download a song, and let's get a high score of it.

1470
02:01:47,302 --> 02:01:48,703
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, I download personally.

1471
02:01:48,863 --> 02:01:51,325
[SPEAKER_24]: I go on, you know, by my style, almost daily.

1472
02:01:51,685 --> 02:02:00,893
[SPEAKER_24]: I look on there in their sim files, you know, selection area, and I look and see what remixes are on there, and I listen to every single Max remix on there, every single one that's been made.

1473
02:02:01,033 --> 02:02:01,193
[SPEAKER_24]: Wow.

1474
02:02:01,213 --> 02:02:01,353
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

1475
02:02:01,873 --> 02:02:21,779
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I know that's wrong, but I do it, you know, because you know what, there are... Next person to take a Max song and mix it with a Pops A or Pops B song, like Max, I don't know, Max, Mr. Wonderful or whatever, I hope you get laughed off the internet, seriously.

1476
02:02:22,019 --> 02:02:24,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Maxiful or whatever, I hope you get laughed off the internet.

1477
02:02:25,066 --> 02:02:27,988
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, someone did make... I think someone did do It's Rennie Max.

1478
02:02:28,048 --> 02:02:28,929
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not really sure that's true.

1479
02:02:28,949 --> 02:02:30,790
[SPEAKER_24]: Anyways, anyways, I was gonna... Kill me!

1480
02:02:30,810 --> 02:02:32,591
[SPEAKER_24]: I was gonna say, now, now, now.

1481
02:02:32,671 --> 02:02:33,812
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, now I know people.

1482
02:02:34,352 --> 02:02:37,634
[SPEAKER_24]: Now, there are good files out there and good songs out there.

1483
02:02:37,734 --> 02:02:39,355
[SPEAKER_24]: That's why you have to listen to them all.

1484
02:02:39,716 --> 02:02:40,096
[SPEAKER_24]: Because...

1485
02:02:40,931 --> 02:02:42,112
[SPEAKER_24]: it might be something good.

1486
02:02:42,352 --> 02:02:44,453
[SPEAKER_24]: However, 99% of the time, it's not.

1487
02:02:44,473 --> 02:02:44,933
[SPEAKER_24]: It's shit.

1488
02:02:45,093 --> 02:02:48,795
[SPEAKER_24]: It's just someone, you know, posting absolute crap on there.

1489
02:02:49,215 --> 02:02:57,819
[SPEAKER_24]: But, see, that's what's kind of cool about Bomayusels, they have a little rating system thing, and you can also, you know, put comments about the file, like, this is a piece of shit, you know, that type of thing.

1490
02:02:57,879 --> 02:02:58,900
[SPEAKER_24]: Constructive comments.

1491
02:02:59,780 --> 02:03:10,005
[SPEAKER_17]: But, uh... Well, actually, I wouldn't say about constructive comments, because, you know, people posting, oh, you stole this, you stole that crap, and then it gets deleted afterwards by a mod.

1492
02:03:12,702 --> 02:03:14,242
[SPEAKER_24]: Anyways, whatever.

1493
02:03:14,983 --> 02:03:18,243
[SPEAKER_24]: So basically, yeah, there's just not a lot of good shit out there anymore.

1494
02:03:18,283 --> 02:03:23,765
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry, FoodMix and Diverse Systems have basically cornered the market in sim files and remixes.

1495
02:03:23,865 --> 02:03:25,565
[SPEAKER_05]: So, sorry.

1496
02:03:25,585 --> 02:03:30,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, and that's all that's going on in the sim scene right now.

1497
02:03:30,787 --> 02:03:31,987
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a variety of tournaments.

1498
02:03:32,227 --> 02:03:33,127
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what, here's an idea.

1499
02:03:34,108 --> 02:03:38,989
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to make your tournament stand out above all the other remixed tournaments, how about throwing some decent prizes?

1500
02:03:39,887 --> 02:03:41,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Get some entry fees and some real good prizes.

1501
02:03:42,048 --> 02:03:43,829
[SPEAKER_05]: Get some folks to donate some good stuff.

1502
02:03:45,190 --> 02:03:47,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Really, what's the best prize you've ever seen for one of these tournaments?

1503
02:03:48,531 --> 02:03:48,852
[SPEAKER_17]: Nothing.

1504
02:03:51,873 --> 02:03:52,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Case in point.

1505
02:03:52,533 --> 02:03:53,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

1506
02:03:53,474 --> 02:03:55,615
[SPEAKER_05]: When do you see the really, really good freestyle routines?

1507
02:03:55,655 --> 02:03:57,556
[SPEAKER_05]: When there's a $1,000 pot on the line.

1508
02:03:57,856 --> 02:03:59,757
[SPEAKER_05]: When do you see the really shit routines?

1509
02:04:00,798 --> 02:04:03,219
[SPEAKER_05]: When it's going to be a pat on the back and a certificate.

1510
02:04:03,279 --> 02:04:03,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Good job.

1511
02:04:03,699 --> 02:04:04,239
[SPEAKER_05]: You the winner.

1512
02:04:05,500 --> 02:04:07,061
[SPEAKER_05]: You winner of tournament.

1513
02:04:09,092 --> 02:04:11,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a little quick note here.

1514
02:04:11,794 --> 02:04:15,355
[SPEAKER_24]: I'd like to mention, Gold Wave is not a remixing program.

1515
02:04:15,776 --> 02:04:17,817
[SPEAKER_24]: Do not use it as a remixing program.

1516
02:04:18,497 --> 02:04:19,978
[SPEAKER_24]: It is not meant for remixing.

1517
02:04:20,138 --> 02:04:21,919
[SPEAKER_24]: It's meant for audio editing.

1518
02:04:22,499 --> 02:04:24,520
[SPEAKER_24]: Audio editing does not include remixing.

1519
02:04:24,840 --> 02:04:26,721
[SPEAKER_24]: Please, do not use it to remix stuff.

1520
02:04:27,141 --> 02:04:30,563
[SPEAKER_05]: Speeding up a song or putting a filter over it does not constitute a remix.

1521
02:04:31,063 --> 02:04:32,304
[SPEAKER_05]: Please do not make it a remix.

1522
02:04:32,344 --> 02:04:34,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Please do not reverse a song and call it a remix.

1523
02:04:34,285 --> 02:04:35,245
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a remix.

1524
02:04:36,766 --> 02:04:37,126
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop.

1525
02:04:37,306 --> 02:04:38,227
[SPEAKER_05]: People, please stop.

1526
02:04:41,852 --> 02:04:43,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, on that note, I think we're going to go to a break.

1527
02:04:45,074 --> 02:04:45,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

1528
02:04:46,455 --> 02:04:47,136
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yes, Loki.

1529
02:04:47,696 --> 02:04:55,742
[SPEAKER_05]: And chopping up a song very crudely and in, I might add, Gold Wave, is also not a remix.

1530
02:04:58,564 --> 02:04:59,425
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, fair enough.

1531
02:05:00,154 --> 02:05:01,695
[SPEAKER_05]: I think what we're going to do is we're going to go to a break.

1532
02:05:01,715 --> 02:05:06,140
[SPEAKER_05]: And why don't we do, because we haven't played any of this in a while, why don't we do some music from FoonMix?

1533
02:05:06,760 --> 02:05:07,221
[SPEAKER_05]: Sound good?

1534
02:05:07,241 --> 02:05:08,241
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1535
02:05:08,522 --> 02:05:09,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds foony.

1536
02:05:09,603 --> 02:05:10,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds foonerific.

1537
02:05:10,644 --> 02:05:11,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we'll play some FoonMix music.

1538
02:05:12,245 --> 02:05:14,007
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we come back, the FUs of the week.

1539
02:05:14,988 --> 02:05:17,750
[SPEAKER_05]: Because what a good way to follow up some FoonMix music.

1540
02:05:18,070 --> 02:05:21,474
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

1541
02:05:21,594 --> 02:05:21,774
[SPEAKER_05]: Enjoy.

1542
02:05:31,093 --> 02:05:32,394
Oh, wait a minute.

1543
02:05:32,414 --> 02:05:32,815
What is this?

1544
02:05:32,955 --> 02:05:34,036
It's making me think about my life.

1545
02:05:34,056 --> 02:05:35,077
Feel the touch of love.

1546
02:06:10,786 --> 02:06:14,657
[SPEAKER_18]: He's the roof operator Hypnotized by the look in your eyes Hit the coast

1547
02:06:51,309 --> 02:06:51,871
See you.

1548
02:11:07,227 --> 02:11:07,869
Thanks for watching!

1549
02:12:01,048 --> 02:12:09,030
[SPEAKER_23]: Warning, Orange Lounge Radio's Bombani Music and More program might be dangerous for you to listen to in the kitchen.

1550
02:12:09,470 --> 02:12:19,553
[SPEAKER_23]: We have reported incidents where exposed listening to this program in the kitchen has caused people to bust out a Sharpie pen, draw arrows on the tiles, and start stomping away.

1551
02:12:20,513 --> 02:12:23,954
[SPEAKER_23]: A friendly public service announcement from Orange Lounge Radio.

1552
02:12:25,259 --> 02:12:27,359
[SPEAKER_05]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1553
02:12:27,960 --> 02:12:30,460
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to try to do a list list in a little while.

1554
02:12:30,580 --> 02:12:33,841
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the topic tonight, so you guys can start thinking about it.

1555
02:12:34,841 --> 02:12:36,121
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, should I hold off on it?

1556
02:12:37,602 --> 02:12:37,822
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1557
02:12:38,182 --> 02:12:39,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we'll hold off on it.

1558
02:12:40,362 --> 02:12:45,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of you guys that were in chat earlier tonight already know what the list list is all about for tonight.

1559
02:12:45,043 --> 02:12:47,084
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, start thinking about that.

1560
02:12:47,104 --> 02:12:50,125
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I am going to do the one that you guys were talking about beforehand.

1561
02:12:50,205 --> 02:12:51,665
[SPEAKER_05]: I said that would be a good list list topic.

1562
02:12:52,742 --> 02:12:53,182
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll do that.

1563
02:12:53,602 --> 02:12:56,143
[SPEAKER_05]: But first, we have to get ranty.

1564
02:12:56,263 --> 02:13:01,605
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, because it just would not be an episode of Orange Lounge Radio if we did not have a little bit... What in the hell is that noise?

1565
02:13:04,126 --> 02:13:06,007
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to talk about what that's all about, Loki.

1566
02:13:06,027 --> 02:13:06,667
[SPEAKER_05]: What is that thing?

1567
02:13:06,807 --> 02:13:07,687
[SPEAKER_05]: It's my gavel meter.

1568
02:13:08,027 --> 02:13:08,748
[SPEAKER_05]: What the hell is that?

1569
02:13:09,208 --> 02:13:13,809
[SPEAKER_24]: It records, or it displays EM fields, like dangerous stuff.

1570
02:13:14,670 --> 02:13:17,991
[SPEAKER_24]: For instance, Jamie's laptop, pretty safe.

1571
02:13:21,041 --> 02:13:25,142
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, that's about like .6 milligauss, or 6 milligausses.

1572
02:13:25,962 --> 02:13:28,302
[SPEAKER_24]: Or, yeah, I think it's .6, that's right, because this is 0 to 1.

1573
02:13:29,282 --> 02:13:36,804
[SPEAKER_24]: But, for instance, like my TV, it's off the scale, so basically I'm getting cancerous rays as I sit there with the TV on.

1574
02:13:36,964 --> 02:13:37,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

1575
02:13:38,844 --> 02:13:40,344
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, it's a cancer meter.

1576
02:13:40,625 --> 02:13:41,745
[SPEAKER_24]: That's basically what it is.

1577
02:13:43,245 --> 02:13:44,125
[SPEAKER_24]: And it's also for ghost hunting.

1578
02:13:44,945 --> 02:13:46,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I like how you just added that in here.

1579
02:13:46,866 --> 02:13:48,026
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, and it's also for ghost hunting.

1580
02:13:50,276 --> 02:13:53,278
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1581
02:14:17,389 --> 02:14:18,030
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, this is bad.

1582
02:14:18,070 --> 02:14:18,812
[SPEAKER_11]: Here is justice.

1583
02:14:26,868 --> 02:14:27,729
[SPEAKER_15]: My first F.U.

1584
02:14:27,769 --> 02:14:32,471
[SPEAKER_15]: goes toward people who decide to weave in and out of lanes in the fog.

1585
02:14:33,251 --> 02:14:35,452
[SPEAKER_15]: That's really stupid and that's how accidents happen.

1586
02:14:35,992 --> 02:14:39,373
[SPEAKER_15]: But then again, I suppose the Darwinism will soon work on that moron.

1587
02:14:40,634 --> 02:14:46,976
[SPEAKER_15]: Another one goes to people who drive too slow in the fog because then all the rest of us are backed up by the people who are speeding running into my ass.

1588
02:14:47,796 --> 02:14:50,558
[SPEAKER_15]: And of course, driving off without stopping or anything, so...

1589
02:14:52,018 --> 02:14:53,540
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, F.U.

1590
02:14:53,560 --> 02:15:15,360
[SPEAKER_15]: goes to the top of my trunk inside because I gouged out a big piece of my thumb just shy of the tendon and it bled and bled and bled and I got one of those band-aids on it that's supposed to trap the fluids underneath so that you'll heal faster using your own antibodies and it looks like a big purple bubble.

1591
02:15:15,801 --> 02:15:16,642
[SPEAKER_15]: It's really disgusting.

1592
02:15:18,187 --> 02:15:20,729
[SPEAKER_15]: and F.U.

1593
02:15:20,789 --> 02:15:30,215
[SPEAKER_15]: toward the financial situation where I can't afford to get the special edition 2DX8 style, but I have Parappa coming, so it's all good.

1594
02:15:32,857 --> 02:15:33,277
[SPEAKER_15]: And F.U.

1595
02:15:33,317 --> 02:15:36,079
[SPEAKER_15]: toward how expensive Dan's present was.

1596
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:41,823
[SPEAKER_15]: Since he doesn't listen to the show, I have no problem saying that I bought Dan the Ultimate Matrix box set

1597
02:15:43,384 --> 02:15:47,827
[SPEAKER_15]: and it was $70 although I think they marked it down by $10 at Target.

1598
02:15:49,407 --> 02:15:49,687
[SPEAKER_15]: I paid $59.

1599
02:15:49,908 --> 02:15:54,190
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I was about that at Target.

1600
02:15:54,230 --> 02:15:54,810
[SPEAKER_15]: They lowered the price.

1601
02:15:55,370 --> 02:16:00,613
[SPEAKER_15]: But still, when I first looked at it and saw a $70 price tag I was freaking out but I bought it for them anyway.

1602
02:16:04,435 --> 02:16:10,259
[SPEAKER_15]: Another F you goes toward just the sick that I had for the past three days.

1603
02:16:11,159 --> 02:16:14,481
[SPEAKER_15]: It was the type of illness that just saps all of your energy.

1604
02:16:15,102 --> 02:16:23,307
[SPEAKER_15]: And I did nothing but eat lobster burritos and ice cream for three days, sat on the floor and played Phantasy Star Online and slept.

1605
02:16:23,867 --> 02:16:27,170
[SPEAKER_15]: Those are the only three things I did for the past three days.

1606
02:16:27,230 --> 02:16:29,331
[SPEAKER_15]: Today's the first day I felt like getting out and moving around.

1607
02:16:30,292 --> 02:16:30,912
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's really it.

1608
02:16:32,848 --> 02:16:35,070
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright, let's move on to Loki!

1609
02:16:39,253 --> 02:16:44,737
[SPEAKER_24]: Um... The only thing I can remember is the stupid bitch that tried to pass me in the right lane today.

1610
02:16:45,577 --> 02:16:49,980
[SPEAKER_24]: Cause, you know, it was merging over, and there's a lane that you're not supposed to pass in.

1611
02:16:50,301 --> 02:16:53,823
[SPEAKER_24]: And so she tries to, you know, accelerate up to me, and she almost hits my car.

1612
02:16:54,143 --> 02:16:57,946
[SPEAKER_24]: And so I honk at her, and she doesn't look at me because she knows she's stupid.

1613
02:16:59,867 --> 02:17:00,308
[SPEAKER_24]: And, um...

1614
02:17:02,620 --> 02:17:30,243
[SPEAKER_24]: and the slow driver I was behind on the way to my dad's house today because he's driving down a one lane road fucking slow because there's a little fog in the distance and he can only see, you know, 999 miles and not, you know, the full thousand, so damn and, um what else, oh, and I feel like I just noticed right now that wonderful device that talks to the dead is all fucked up because it was in

1615
02:17:31,601 --> 02:17:40,229
[SPEAKER_24]: My backpack type thing and cut all the wires broken and god knows where the germanium is.

1616
02:17:40,709 --> 02:17:42,251
[SPEAKER_24]: Now I gotta fix it so that sucks.

1617
02:17:44,033 --> 02:17:57,305
[SPEAKER_24]: And then fuck you to my work for making me have to cook more shit because I want to have another potluck because now they want to start becoming like a team or something which I guess involves numerous potlucks.

1618
02:17:58,345 --> 02:18:03,229
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't like potlucks, fucking bastards, just because they want to eat pigs.

1619
02:18:05,230 --> 02:18:15,839
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, and then also, fuck you, that stupid orc that killed my, uh, Malala's manslave character.

1620
02:18:17,020 --> 02:18:21,343
[SPEAKER_24]: And that sucked, because poor Taru was just like, looked like a cookie.

1621
02:18:21,543 --> 02:18:21,904
[SPEAKER_24]: ADDICT!

1622
02:18:23,084 --> 02:18:24,606
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh yeah, I think you were there too.

1623
02:18:26,268 --> 02:18:38,599
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know, I don't really have much to complain about.

1624
02:18:38,879 --> 02:18:44,845
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh yeah, my boss for not giving me my review yet, and I know I'm not going to get a raise, even though I've been there for five years.

1625
02:18:45,780 --> 02:18:47,842
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm not getting paid shit, so that sucks.

1626
02:18:48,523 --> 02:18:50,845
[SPEAKER_24]: And then, uh, I don't know.

1627
02:18:51,986 --> 02:18:53,107
[SPEAKER_24]: I just hate Christmas.

1628
02:18:53,567 --> 02:18:57,711
[SPEAKER_24]: Fuck you to Christmas, because, you know, I don't want to buy people gifts.

1629
02:18:57,931 --> 02:18:58,492
[SPEAKER_24]: You're a Grinch.

1630
02:18:58,932 --> 02:19:05,278
[SPEAKER_24]: I buy people gifts all year round, and I don't really give a shit about the birthday of Jesus or whatever it's supposed to be for.

1631
02:19:05,879 --> 02:19:09,142
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, I'm sure Immaculate Conception...

1632
02:19:12,082 --> 02:19:13,505
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, that's what I gotta say.

1633
02:19:14,367 --> 02:19:15,750
[SPEAKER_24]: Mary was a fucking whore, okay?

1634
02:19:16,392 --> 02:19:17,635
[SPEAKER_24]: She just does not want to admit it.

1635
02:19:17,655 --> 02:19:19,339
[SPEAKER_24]: They're not putting it in the books, okay?

1636
02:19:20,160 --> 02:19:20,902
[SPEAKER_24]: But you know that...

1637
02:19:22,315 --> 02:19:23,015
[SPEAKER_24]: She had her way.

1638
02:19:23,455 --> 02:19:25,616
[SPEAKER_24]: She had her way around Bethlehem there.

1639
02:19:26,437 --> 02:19:27,017
[SPEAKER_24]: Little slut.

1640
02:19:27,297 --> 02:19:31,659
[SPEAKER_24]: Anyway, um... Well, now that we're all going to hell, anything else you want to share?

1641
02:19:32,499 --> 02:19:41,483
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, yeah, if I give my printer for being out of ink and I have to buy more ink because the fucking cartridges are, like, tiny, you print, like, one page and it's like, Out of ink!

1642
02:19:41,923 --> 02:19:42,903
[SPEAKER_24]: You're out of ink!

1643
02:19:43,484 --> 02:19:44,064
[SPEAKER_24]: Ah, shit.

1644
02:19:44,804 --> 02:19:52,390
[SPEAKER_24]: I might as well buy a new printer, because it comes with the ink when you buy a new printer, and it's just about as expensive as replacing the ink, so why not?

1645
02:19:52,410 --> 02:19:53,971
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright, I'm done.

1646
02:20:01,147 --> 02:20:08,730
[SPEAKER_05]: An F you to the fog, because fog is scary, and I don't like driving in it, and I think people are always going to run into me, and it's scary.

1647
02:20:09,270 --> 02:20:11,891
[SPEAKER_05]: An F you to the fact that the bar sucked last night.

1648
02:20:11,971 --> 02:20:13,711
[SPEAKER_05]: I did not have really a lot of fun.

1649
02:20:13,751 --> 02:20:17,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, I had fun with the person that I went with, but I just wasn't feeling it.

1650
02:20:18,649 --> 02:20:20,610
[SPEAKER_05]: So, F you to bars in general.

1651
02:20:20,650 --> 02:20:21,550
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I'm going to stop going.

1652
02:20:21,650 --> 02:20:23,410
[SPEAKER_05]: Except for karaoke, because I love karaoke.

1653
02:20:25,831 --> 02:20:28,832
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't really have a whole lot else.

1654
02:20:28,892 --> 02:20:39,354
[SPEAKER_05]: An F you to not really getting any sleep in the past few days, and the fact that I'm not going to get any more in the next few, because I've got a lot of stuff going on at work next week, and I just want to cry.

1655
02:20:41,335 --> 02:20:42,055
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it for me.

1656
02:20:42,215 --> 02:20:44,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go on to DDR Angel.

1657
02:20:48,557 --> 02:20:51,039
[SPEAKER_13]: As I try not to strangle Rob with the mic cord.

1658
02:20:51,499 --> 02:20:51,800
[SPEAKER_13]: Yay!

1659
02:20:54,241 --> 02:20:55,142
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't even know.

1660
02:20:55,402 --> 02:21:05,990
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, yeah, just F you to circumstances, because... Well, not for me personally, but for other people that I... Yeah, I know.

1661
02:21:06,750 --> 02:21:09,312
[SPEAKER_13]: But I don't like said person either.

1662
02:21:09,992 --> 02:21:10,633
[SPEAKER_13]: So never mind.

1663
02:21:13,243 --> 02:21:22,847
[SPEAKER_13]: and yeah, nothing else because it's Christmas week and I'm not as angsty as I was last week, so too bad.

1664
02:21:26,148 --> 02:21:29,609
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Arcadian42, what's on your mind?

1665
02:21:29,629 --> 02:21:36,691
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, let's see, uh, fuck you to Feel Uncounted Law at the moment.

1666
02:21:36,711 --> 02:21:38,692
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, I just feel tired tonight.

1667
02:21:39,792 --> 02:21:41,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, fuck you to... You're getting it.

1668
02:21:42,509 --> 02:21:42,929
[SPEAKER_06]: Am I getting?

1669
02:21:43,389 --> 02:21:46,910
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I don't know if I'm getting anything, but I just had colds and stuff.

1670
02:21:47,691 --> 02:21:56,253
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I've just been... Okay, uh... I don't know.

1671
02:21:56,273 --> 02:21:58,254
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not really too much.

1672
02:21:58,394 --> 02:22:03,516
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll give a preliminary fuck you to the Sacramento Quark, because they're probably going to make me pay the full damn fine.

1673
02:22:04,596 --> 02:22:06,176
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope they'll reduce it for me.

1674
02:22:06,257 --> 02:22:08,837
[SPEAKER_06]: Out of the goodness of their hearts.

1675
02:22:09,918 --> 02:22:10,778
[SPEAKER_06]: They have no hearts!

1676
02:22:12,412 --> 02:22:13,733
[SPEAKER_06]: But, we'll see.

1677
02:22:16,815 --> 02:22:17,195
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright.

1678
02:22:18,416 --> 02:22:19,216
[SPEAKER_17]: Explicit!

1679
02:22:20,757 --> 02:22:21,217
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright.

1680
02:22:22,158 --> 02:22:26,520
[SPEAKER_17]: I've already said most of my Effie is from the SVGL tournament.

1681
02:22:27,841 --> 02:22:29,662
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, an Effie goes to the Fog.

1682
02:22:30,322 --> 02:22:32,924
[SPEAKER_17]: God damn, I couldn't even see what the hell is driving.

1683
02:22:33,804 --> 02:22:40,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, thank god I didn't go to SVGL because I would have cried like a little girl in the Fog because I hate Fog.

1684
02:22:40,248 --> 02:22:41,069
[SPEAKER_04]: I really, really hate Fog.

1685
02:22:41,089 --> 02:22:41,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Fog is sexy.

1686
02:22:42,475 --> 02:22:46,100
[SPEAKER_17]: F you to my friend Patrick for giving me the wrong directions.

1687
02:22:46,140 --> 02:22:47,982
[SPEAKER_17]: We almost got lost a few times.

1688
02:22:48,663 --> 02:22:52,167
[SPEAKER_17]: Heading to SVGL and heading back again to Sacramento.

1689
02:22:53,608 --> 02:22:58,034
[SPEAKER_17]: Either that or just giving F you to Yahoo Maps for messing up the directions.

1690
02:22:59,731 --> 02:23:03,633
[SPEAKER_17]: F you to my friend for misplanning the time management just heading to SVGL.

1691
02:23:04,513 --> 02:23:12,456
[SPEAKER_17]: We were supposed to be there like around 11.15 as planned, but I had planned earlier, but he wanted me to do certain things.

1692
02:23:13,377 --> 02:23:17,678
[SPEAKER_17]: Therefore causing us to be there around like 11.35, almost being late to the whole tournament.

1693
02:23:20,159 --> 02:23:23,861
[SPEAKER_17]: And I hate to say this, but F you to my friend Sean for, not Shane, for...

1694
02:23:24,798 --> 02:23:43,073
[SPEAKER_17]: Being to MSBGL very late, instead he went to Milpitas Golf Land, playing in the groove for 30 minutes, when you know there's a big tournament that a friend of ours, who was actually at his car, who hella wanted to compete in this first big tournament, and trying to shine at his first tournament.

1695
02:23:43,533 --> 02:23:49,478
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we have an actual... You know that's kind of smart, to go play in the groove at Milpitas, because you know everybody's a Sunnyvale?

1696
02:23:50,439 --> 02:23:51,900
[SPEAKER_24]: No, hella is not a word.

1697
02:23:52,981 --> 02:23:53,281
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

1698
02:23:55,836 --> 02:23:56,076
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

1699
02:23:56,437 --> 02:24:01,521
[SPEAKER_15]: I just needed to point out that somehow or another I managed to spend $111.11 at the grocery store today.

1700
02:24:03,082 --> 02:24:05,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for that bit of utter randomness.

1701
02:24:05,945 --> 02:24:06,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Back to explicit.

1702
02:24:07,246 --> 02:24:13,371
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, an FU goes to having four freaking finals the whole week, not getting me enough sleep.

1703
02:24:15,493 --> 02:24:19,536
[SPEAKER_17]: Damn, finals sucks, but at least it's over with and at least I passed all my fucking classes.

1704
02:24:20,437 --> 02:24:21,178
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank God for that.

1705
02:24:22,757 --> 02:24:29,720
[SPEAKER_17]: and FU2 people who actually spent $23,000 on a fucking Yu-Gi-Oh card.

1706
02:24:30,960 --> 02:24:31,220
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1707
02:24:32,681 --> 02:24:34,642
[SPEAKER_17]: That is ridiculously stupid.

1708
02:24:35,722 --> 02:24:41,865
[SPEAKER_17]: Spending $23,000 on a freaking card, which is going to be released later on as an actual comment.

1709
02:24:42,785 --> 02:24:45,286
[SPEAKER_24]: Everyone knows that, you know, Pokemon's where it's at.

1710
02:24:46,659 --> 02:24:49,660
[SPEAKER_17]: A card collector with lots of liquid assets to throw away at any whim?

1711
02:25:12,414 --> 02:25:14,595
[SPEAKER_24]: A person who burns money in his fireplace.

1712
02:25:14,635 --> 02:25:16,756
[SPEAKER_24]: A person who wipes his ass with dollar bills.

1713
02:25:18,256 --> 02:25:19,877
[SPEAKER_24]: A person who uses napkins.

1714
02:25:21,578 --> 02:25:23,538
[SPEAKER_24]: Or actually, dollar bills as napkins.

1715
02:25:25,819 --> 02:25:28,260
[SPEAKER_24]: A person who eats money.

1716
02:25:32,122 --> 02:25:37,364
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, and F you goes to the scar I have on my leg during the SVGL3 tournament.

1717
02:25:38,544 --> 02:25:40,905
[SPEAKER_17]: I was non-stop bleeding the whole time.

1718
02:25:42,242 --> 02:25:43,923
[SPEAKER_24]: Wow, really, and you didn't die?

1719
02:25:43,943 --> 02:25:46,424
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't die, so I'm still alive.

1720
02:25:46,784 --> 02:25:49,686
[SPEAKER_17]: Not poisoned and stuff and all.

1721
02:25:50,086 --> 02:25:53,528
[SPEAKER_17]: And FU goes to the rest of the drama on SVGL3, of course.

1722
02:25:53,928 --> 02:25:57,409
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, I screwed up on the fucking tournament, regardless of the TAT issues or not.

1723
02:25:59,330 --> 02:26:03,512
[SPEAKER_17]: And FU goes to Amp, the drink Amp, for not keeping me awake the whole time.

1724
02:26:03,572 --> 02:26:06,434
[SPEAKER_17]: It says it's supposed to keep me awake just like balls does.

1725
02:26:07,113 --> 02:26:09,114
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, those assholes were lying to you.

1726
02:26:09,975 --> 02:26:12,076
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry there's no substitute for balls.

1727
02:26:12,516 --> 02:26:14,837
[SPEAKER_24]: Some good balls down your throat is just perfect.

1728
02:26:14,857 --> 02:26:17,379
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, because someone said, amp is better.

1729
02:26:17,719 --> 02:26:18,119
[SPEAKER_17]: Wow.

1730
02:26:18,619 --> 02:26:21,881
[SPEAKER_17]: I nearly fell asleep in the wheel and almost got into an accident.

1731
02:26:22,081 --> 02:26:25,103
[SPEAKER_24]: God damn that stimulant for not keeping me away.

1732
02:26:27,256 --> 02:26:30,957
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, that's how bad our freaking amp is.

1733
02:26:31,037 --> 02:26:37,880
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh yeah, the Amp2DX is good for being hella- either the songs being hella off-sync or just me being off-sync as shit.

1734
02:26:38,920 --> 02:26:45,703
[SPEAKER_17]: Scoring like 90% good is not cool, especially for songs that you nearly- That's cool for me.

1735
02:26:45,823 --> 02:26:51,805
[SPEAKER_17]: That's like playing D2R with a full grade attack, which I nearly done.

1736
02:26:54,295 --> 02:26:58,137
[SPEAKER_17]: And finally... And... Oh, no, I'm coming!

1737
02:26:58,157 --> 02:26:59,878
[SPEAKER_17]: Wrap it up!

1738
02:27:00,398 --> 02:27:02,700
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, yeah, of course, FU for not sleeping, of course.

1739
02:27:03,120 --> 02:27:06,982
[SPEAKER_17]: FU for actually cleaning up for fucking Christmas.

1740
02:27:07,022 --> 02:27:11,584
[SPEAKER_17]: I know Christmas is at our house, and that's why I'm taking it this week, but I shouldn't have been cleaning up the whole week.

1741
02:27:11,825 --> 02:27:13,525
[SPEAKER_17]: I had finals, for goddamn sakes.

1742
02:27:15,346 --> 02:27:18,428
[SPEAKER_05]: I swear to God, you're going to have your own spin-off show where you just sit there.

1743
02:27:18,948 --> 02:27:19,949
[SPEAKER_05]: You and Dark Child.

1744
02:27:20,029 --> 02:27:21,530
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to give you guys your own show.

1745
02:27:22,090 --> 02:27:23,531
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be on at 3 in the morning.

1746
02:27:24,926 --> 02:27:26,787
[SPEAKER_05]: so you can get this all out of your system.

1747
02:27:29,188 --> 02:27:30,069
[SPEAKER_17]: Now wrap it up.

1748
02:27:30,729 --> 02:27:32,230
[SPEAKER_17]: Fine.

1749
02:27:32,610 --> 02:27:33,991
[SPEAKER_17]: That has to be continued.

1750
02:27:34,672 --> 02:27:36,653
[SPEAKER_24]: No, no, never to be continued.

1751
02:27:37,153 --> 02:27:37,933
[SPEAKER_24]: Over.

1752
02:27:37,973 --> 02:27:38,154
[SPEAKER_24]: Done.

1753
02:27:38,454 --> 02:27:40,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you in the booth or something?

1754
02:27:40,295 --> 02:27:42,196
[SPEAKER_05]: What is this sound effect?

1755
02:27:42,516 --> 02:27:44,877
[SPEAKER_24]: Why hasn't he tried out for like the real world?

1756
02:27:45,278 --> 02:27:47,979
[SPEAKER_24]: I hate my roommates because they annoy me so.

1757
02:27:48,059 --> 02:27:49,300
[SPEAKER_24]: Let me count the ways.

1758
02:27:52,196 --> 02:27:53,377
[SPEAKER_24]: Damn those cameras!

1759
02:27:54,058 --> 02:27:56,219
[SPEAKER_24]: Let's fucking break the cameras and blow up the house.

1760
02:27:59,002 --> 02:28:00,884
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, like I said, to be continued.

1761
02:28:01,464 --> 02:28:03,466
[SPEAKER_17]: There's no ending of the FU, bruh.

1762
02:28:05,339 --> 02:28:06,460
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Sheriff.

1763
02:28:29,861 --> 02:28:30,801
[SPEAKER_05]: Who needs friends?

1764
02:28:31,242 --> 02:28:34,824
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Ranma S says, You know what you sound like right now?

1765
02:28:34,844 --> 02:28:36,464
[SPEAKER_05]: You sound like our old microphone.

1766
02:28:38,165 --> 02:28:41,707
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Matt, coming to you from two years ago.

1767
02:28:41,727 --> 02:28:43,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.

1768
02:28:44,609 --> 02:28:48,931
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Ranma S says, F you to the idiots on my job for stealing broken iPods.

1769
02:28:49,231 --> 02:28:50,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you that fucking stupid?

1770
02:28:50,692 --> 02:28:54,974
[SPEAKER_05]: Another F you to the RIAA MPAA for taking down supernova.org.

1771
02:28:55,054 --> 02:28:56,314
[SPEAKER_05]: Rot in hell, you bastards.

1772
02:28:56,354 --> 02:28:56,995
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's funny.

1773
02:28:57,075 --> 02:28:57,215
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait!

1774
02:28:57,850 --> 02:29:03,893
[SPEAKER_05]: If you actually go to supernova.org and check out the site, it says that they shut down due to bandwidth issues, not because of the RIA or MPAA.

1775
02:29:03,973 --> 02:29:08,036
[SPEAKER_05]: However, bi-torrent.com.

1776
02:29:08,236 --> 02:29:13,179
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not B-U-I, but B-I, like bisexual, bi-torrent.com.

1777
02:29:13,559 --> 02:29:14,259
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank me later.

1778
02:29:15,500 --> 02:29:22,664
[SPEAKER_24]: And all I have to say is... There's something else probably going to come out that's going to replace BitTorrent anyways.

1779
02:29:24,215 --> 02:29:25,375
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm coming out of the booth!

1780
02:29:26,076 --> 02:29:28,236
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm just using Torrent Reactor right now.

1781
02:29:28,376 --> 02:29:29,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, back to the FUs.

1782
02:29:31,318 --> 02:29:40,341
[SPEAKER_05]: And an FU, continuing DJ Ranma S, and an FU to the customer that tried to kick my ass for buying the very last mini PS2 in my store.

1783
02:29:40,901 --> 02:29:42,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Suck on a cold!

1784
02:29:42,361 --> 02:29:44,222
[SPEAKER_24]: Stop buying smaller products!

1785
02:29:44,402 --> 02:29:49,404
[SPEAKER_24]: Goddammit, Sony's trying to do to you what they did, or what Nintendo did with the Game Boy.

1786
02:29:49,484 --> 02:29:52,505
[SPEAKER_24]: Just release the same shit, smaller and less, uh...

1787
02:29:59,265 --> 02:30:06,871
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna shove that tube up your ass that you're using for the sound effects.

1788
02:30:09,833 --> 02:30:11,395
[SPEAKER_05]: Sherlock has an FU.

1789
02:30:12,255 --> 02:30:16,959
[SPEAKER_05]: An FU to the Syracuse DDR scene for being a bunch of hypocritical shit-talkers.

1790
02:30:17,479 --> 02:30:19,661
[SPEAKER_05]: You're the reason why I hate going to the local arcades.

1791
02:30:22,038 --> 02:30:24,100
[SPEAKER_05]: And Jazz says, F you to Fog.

1792
02:30:24,420 --> 02:30:26,902
[SPEAKER_05]: I had to drive via road reflectors last night.

1793
02:30:29,404 --> 02:30:33,967
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura sends a message and it says, I want to offer a fuck you to that Sky guy.

1794
02:30:34,047 --> 02:30:35,228
[SPEAKER_05]: He really pisses me off.

1795
02:30:35,348 --> 02:30:35,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously.

1796
02:30:37,669 --> 02:30:38,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Screw you, hippie.

1797
02:30:42,520 --> 02:30:48,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Jaded2004 says, F you to my windows for making it cold in here because it's 12 degrees outside.

1798
02:30:49,065 --> 02:30:50,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, it's time to move to the Bahamas.

1799
02:30:51,066 --> 02:30:52,507
[SPEAKER_24]: Seriously.

1800
02:30:52,587 --> 02:30:53,488
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't see it.

1801
02:30:53,969 --> 02:30:54,249
[SPEAKER_24]: Sorry.

1802
02:30:57,991 --> 02:30:59,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I see that tube for a minute?

1803
02:30:59,673 --> 02:30:59,773
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1804
02:30:59,793 --> 02:31:00,653
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I want to do the sound effect.

1805
02:31:00,694 --> 02:31:02,295
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I want to do the sound effect.

1806
02:31:02,315 --> 02:31:03,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, let me do the sound effect.

1807
02:31:05,397 --> 02:31:07,198
[SPEAKER_03]: This is God talking.

1808
02:31:07,679 --> 02:31:09,760
[SPEAKER_00]: Loki, you need to be punished.

1809
02:31:14,844 --> 02:31:16,405
[SPEAKER_24]: He has rock jerbs on it now.

1810
02:31:17,986 --> 02:31:18,646
[SPEAKER_24]: I Frenched it.

1811
02:31:20,167 --> 02:31:27,431
[SPEAKER_05]: Rychan says, F you to the manic depressants that seem to find me and being the person I am, listening to their whining and act like their friend.

1812
02:31:28,031 --> 02:31:30,773
[SPEAKER_05]: F you to my awesome week coming to an end on my birthday.

1813
02:31:31,353 --> 02:31:33,074
[SPEAKER_05]: F you to myself for crying so much.

1814
02:31:33,995 --> 02:31:35,836
[SPEAKER_05]: Rychan needs an Orange Lounge hug.

1815
02:31:36,636 --> 02:31:37,417
Hug!

1816
02:31:39,165 --> 02:31:42,067
[SPEAKER_05]: and F you to my ignition pads finally biting the dust.

1817
02:31:42,187 --> 02:31:42,907
[SPEAKER_05]: I loved you guys.

1818
02:31:43,107 --> 02:31:44,228
[SPEAKER_05]: Nine months of accomplishments.

1819
02:31:44,588 --> 02:31:44,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Cry face.

1820
02:31:46,489 --> 02:31:53,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Illusion says F you to this crazy lady that was honking at us and flipping us off as we headed home from Knott's Berry Farm last night.

1821
02:31:53,674 --> 02:31:54,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, hold on.

1822
02:31:55,415 --> 02:31:56,455
[SPEAKER_05]: I have two issues with that.

1823
02:31:58,296 --> 02:32:01,418
[SPEAKER_05]: A, when you're in SoCal, that's the way everybody drives down there.

1824
02:32:01,758 --> 02:32:02,539
[SPEAKER_05]: You're all fucking nuts.

1825
02:32:02,919 --> 02:32:05,601
[SPEAKER_05]: And B, what the hell were you doing at Knott's Berry Farm?

1826
02:32:06,673 --> 02:32:07,794
[SPEAKER_24]: Dude, that place rocks.

1827
02:32:07,814 --> 02:32:09,176
[SPEAKER_24]: You can make your own candles.

1828
02:32:09,316 --> 02:32:10,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Knott's Berry Farm.

1829
02:32:11,898 --> 02:32:15,802
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know about now, but five years ago, man, the laughing stock of theme parks.

1830
02:32:15,822 --> 02:32:19,246
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know about you, but how can they have a theme park based around jelly?

1831
02:32:19,787 --> 02:32:20,307
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, really.

1832
02:32:21,008 --> 02:32:21,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Jelly Land.

1833
02:32:23,330 --> 02:32:25,532
[SPEAKER_05]: With Snoopy and his jelly bandits.

1834
02:32:28,175 --> 02:32:29,737
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like an overrated, like...

1835
02:32:31,021 --> 02:32:31,862
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even know what.

1836
02:32:32,002 --> 02:32:33,203
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, illusion continues.

1837
02:32:33,363 --> 02:32:39,209
[SPEAKER_05]: F you to myself for being too greedy to want to pay my own hard-earned money on other people.

1838
02:32:40,851 --> 02:32:42,012
[SPEAKER_05]: And, yeah, emphasis on hard.

1839
02:32:42,393 --> 02:32:44,014
[SPEAKER_05]: And F you to televangelism.

1840
02:32:47,398 --> 02:32:47,999
[SPEAKER_05]: And lastly...

1841
02:32:49,110 --> 02:32:53,431
[SPEAKER_05]: Podo says, F you to imbalanced paladins in the World of Warcraft.

1842
02:32:53,871 --> 02:32:56,132
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm tired of killing the thing three times.

1843
02:32:56,212 --> 02:32:57,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, don't play World of Warcraft.

1844
02:32:57,833 --> 02:33:02,314
[SPEAKER_05]: And another F you to Loki for that Virgin Mary comment.

1845
02:33:02,614 --> 02:33:03,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Just kidding.

1846
02:33:03,974 --> 02:33:12,557
[SPEAKER_05]: But do F you to not say, and I quote, JK, but do F you to not saying Merry Christmas, everyone.

1847
02:33:14,658 --> 02:33:15,278
[SPEAKER_24]: Christmas?

1848
02:33:17,352 --> 02:33:17,712
[SPEAKER_05]: Get it?

1849
02:33:17,772 --> 02:33:18,493
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no.

1850
02:33:18,633 --> 02:33:19,253
[SPEAKER_05]: No more.

1851
02:33:19,293 --> 02:33:19,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Get it?

1852
02:33:19,733 --> 02:33:20,594
[SPEAKER_05]: Chris Mass?

1853
02:33:20,874 --> 02:33:21,234
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1854
02:33:21,954 --> 02:33:23,075
[SPEAKER_24]: Christ Mass.

1855
02:33:23,315 --> 02:33:26,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Illusion says Knott's Berry Farm is only ten bucks now.

1856
02:33:26,677 --> 02:33:27,077
[SPEAKER_05]: I get it.

1857
02:33:27,157 --> 02:33:28,198
[SPEAKER_05]: I get what you pay for.

1858
02:33:30,719 --> 02:33:32,540
[SPEAKER_05]: Do they pay you ten dollars to go there?

1859
02:33:33,440 --> 02:33:35,001
[SPEAKER_05]: So if an enema is ten dollars.

1860
02:33:40,004 --> 02:33:42,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, you guys want to do some listless tonight?

1861
02:33:43,416 --> 02:33:45,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, we need some folks to participate in Listless tonight.

1862
02:33:45,576 --> 02:33:46,037
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure enough.

1863
02:33:46,217 --> 02:33:47,057
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1864
02:33:47,137 --> 02:33:48,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie, you're going to do it, right?

1865
02:33:48,697 --> 02:33:49,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure enough.

1866
02:33:49,177 --> 02:33:49,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, you're going to do it?

1867
02:33:51,278 --> 02:33:51,638
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1868
02:33:51,898 --> 02:33:52,838
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm going to do it.

1869
02:33:53,018 --> 02:33:53,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Angel, are you going to do it?

1870
02:33:54,638 --> 02:33:55,779
[SPEAKER_05]: And why don't you two share?

1871
02:33:57,379 --> 02:33:58,499
[SPEAKER_05]: The couch gets to share.

1872
02:33:59,920 --> 02:34:00,840
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

1873
02:34:00,860 --> 02:34:00,920
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1874
02:34:01,100 --> 02:34:01,980
[SPEAKER_05]: I changed my mind.

1875
02:34:02,340 --> 02:34:04,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Arcadian gets to do it by himself.

1876
02:34:04,061 --> 02:34:05,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Jonas, you don't get to do it because you were late.

1877
02:34:06,678 --> 02:34:10,160
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you want to do it late, or if you want to do it... Jonas is late.

1878
02:34:10,341 --> 02:34:11,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Is he pregnant?

1879
02:34:11,181 --> 02:34:13,283
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to help Arcadian, you can.

1880
02:34:13,723 --> 02:34:13,983
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1881
02:34:14,704 --> 02:34:24,350
[SPEAKER_05]: The way Listless works... Okay, we haven't done Listless in a long time, but the way Listless works, because you know how we have this obsession in our society where we have to create the top list.

1882
02:34:24,370 --> 02:34:28,113
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, we have to have the top three of all... Actually, can I have the tube?

1883
02:34:28,473 --> 02:34:29,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I have the tube for a minute?

1884
02:34:30,174 --> 02:34:34,097
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the top three of all time.

1885
02:34:34,617 --> 02:34:35,037
[SPEAKER_24]: Beatmania2DX

1886
02:35:01,660 --> 02:35:05,161
[SPEAKER_05]: Rumor is that someday, somehow, they're going to bring it over to the USA.

1887
02:35:05,722 --> 02:35:11,284
[SPEAKER_05]: But they can't really call it Beatmania 2DX, because there was no Beatmania DX.

1888
02:35:12,084 --> 02:35:15,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, you can't really call it Hip Hop Mania either, because that's gay.

1889
02:35:16,265 --> 02:35:20,627
[SPEAKER_05]: So, we have to come up with a new name for Beatmania 2DX.

1890
02:35:20,707 --> 02:35:28,750
[SPEAKER_05]: So tonight, we're going to come up with the top three names for Beatmania 2DX in America of all time.

1891
02:35:30,026 --> 02:35:32,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Your head does not have the water for properties of the tube!

1892
02:35:33,188 --> 02:35:42,595
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, remember guys, top three names for Beatmania 2DX's American release of all time.

1893
02:35:42,755 --> 02:35:50,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, of course, to humor those people that are going to get out there and go, you know, Orange Lounge Radio, you fags.

1894
02:35:51,092 --> 02:35:54,654
[SPEAKER_05]: What they should do is just call it Beat Mania 2DX.

1895
02:35:55,554 --> 02:35:56,155
[SPEAKER_05]: Who cares?

1896
02:35:56,535 --> 02:35:56,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1897
02:35:56,835 --> 02:35:58,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of that... I understand that.

1898
02:35:59,236 --> 02:36:04,019
[SPEAKER_15]: Speaking of that... My stipulation though is that nobody can pick Beat Mania 2DX as the title.

1899
02:36:04,139 --> 02:36:05,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's a given.

1900
02:36:05,339 --> 02:36:07,740
[SPEAKER_05]: And nobody can say Hip Hop Mania 2 either.

1901
02:36:07,780 --> 02:36:08,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Be more creative.

1902
02:36:08,881 --> 02:36:09,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, hold on.

1903
02:36:09,441 --> 02:36:09,541
[SPEAKER_17]: What?

1904
02:36:09,561 --> 02:36:12,563
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually hear people call Beat Mania 2DX Beat Mania 2Dicks.

1905
02:36:12,903 --> 02:36:13,423
[SPEAKER_05]: So, okay.

1906
02:36:13,984 --> 02:36:14,684
[SPEAKER_05]: Beat Me With Two Dicks?

1907
02:36:14,704 --> 02:36:15,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that what you just said?

1908
02:36:15,444 --> 02:36:16,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Beat Mania 2Dicks.

1909
02:36:16,305 --> 02:36:17,125
[SPEAKER_05]: Beat You With Two Dicks?

1910
02:36:17,165 --> 02:36:17,945
[SPEAKER_05]: I can have that arranged.

1911
02:36:18,026 --> 02:36:18,346
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1912
02:36:19,046 --> 02:36:19,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Not by me, of course.

1913
02:36:20,227 --> 02:36:20,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1914
02:36:28,562 --> 02:36:31,643
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so just humor us a little bit, you guys.

1915
02:36:31,783 --> 02:36:33,424
[SPEAKER_05]: We're coming up with new names, okay?

1916
02:36:33,984 --> 02:36:34,304
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1917
02:36:35,665 --> 02:36:40,886
[SPEAKER_05]: In the meantime, we're going to go to a break featuring some tracks from Beatmania 2DX.

1918
02:36:41,226 --> 02:36:41,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Go figure.

1919
02:36:42,367 --> 02:36:44,528
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, who knew that I would want to choose this kind of song?

1920
02:36:45,188 --> 02:36:46,208
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to hear the Safari?

1921
02:36:46,228 --> 02:36:47,969
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to hear a Safari?

1922
02:36:48,029 --> 02:36:50,490
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we'll do the Safari, because the Safari's been in like every 2DX.

1923
02:36:50,710 --> 02:36:51,350
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, we'll be back.

1924
02:38:29,705 --> 02:38:30,866
Thanks for watching!

1925
02:39:03,757 --> 02:39:05,698
Thanks for watching!

1926
02:40:24,022 --> 02:40:25,146
Thanks for watching!

1927
02:43:44,071 --> 02:43:45,852
Gaming Radio, so uncensored.

1928
02:44:06,915 --> 02:44:11,441
[SPEAKER_05]: and even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

1929
02:44:11,601 --> 02:44:12,963
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio.

1930
02:44:15,346 --> 02:44:19,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello everybody and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

1931
02:44:20,520 --> 02:44:22,522
[SPEAKER_05]: We're about to get this listless segment underway.

1932
02:44:22,602 --> 02:44:32,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember that we are trying to find the top three names that they could call Beatmania 2DX if they released it in the US.

1933
02:44:32,389 --> 02:44:35,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you can't call it 2DX because there was no one.

1934
02:44:36,372 --> 02:44:38,894
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, then you could argue that Hip Hop Mania would be the name.

1935
02:44:39,274 --> 02:44:41,456
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's gay, so we're not going to call it that either.

1936
02:44:41,636 --> 02:44:44,418
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to find a new name for it here.

1937
02:44:46,700 --> 02:44:50,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Or for anybody that plays Final Fantasy XI with me, it's SoTeets.

1938
02:44:52,564 --> 02:44:52,964
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1939
02:44:57,126 --> 02:44:57,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1940
02:44:58,946 --> 02:45:02,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yes, DarkSakura, you need, it's right, well, you threw it on the floor.

1941
02:45:02,068 --> 02:45:02,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody did.

1942
02:45:07,350 --> 02:45:07,810
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, Rob?

1943
02:45:08,931 --> 02:45:09,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1944
02:45:09,571 --> 02:45:09,851
[SPEAKER_15]: Addict!

1945
02:45:12,592 --> 02:45:14,733
[SPEAKER_15]: Then again, I'm over here chatting with two people about PSO.

1946
02:45:14,793 --> 02:45:17,454
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, you're like, oh, I'm going to go home and I'm going to play PSO all night.

1947
02:45:17,494 --> 02:45:18,935
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I'm going to go eat my shake.

1948
02:45:21,593 --> 02:45:23,174
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's see.

1949
02:45:23,234 --> 02:45:27,155
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to try to find some game show music here, but I don't know if I have anything.

1950
02:45:28,235 --> 02:45:28,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Dammit!

1951
02:45:28,435 --> 02:45:29,416
[SPEAKER_05]: We need Price is Right music.

1952
02:45:30,496 --> 02:45:31,856
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of have Price is Right music.

1953
02:45:31,876 --> 02:45:33,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I do have an idea what we could do.

1954
02:45:33,217 --> 02:45:34,557
[SPEAKER_15]: We need Plinko music.

1955
02:45:34,717 --> 02:45:36,838
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have... There is no Plinko music.

1956
02:45:36,858 --> 02:45:38,558
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

1957
02:45:38,598 --> 02:45:40,399
[SPEAKER_15]: We need the yodeling one.

1958
02:45:42,860 --> 02:45:44,620
[SPEAKER_15]: You know which one that is where he goes up the mountain?

1959
02:45:44,800 --> 02:45:45,741
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I got a better idea.

1960
02:45:45,761 --> 02:45:46,381
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to do this one.

1961
02:45:48,244 --> 02:45:55,786
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not that it's a... Okay, seriously, stop.

1962
02:45:59,646 --> 02:46:01,026
[SPEAKER_24]: That's right, everybody.

1963
02:46:02,147 --> 02:46:05,227
[SPEAKER_24]: It's time to play Listless.

1964
02:46:06,807 --> 02:46:14,649
[SPEAKER_24]: Tonight's celebrities for Listless will be determining our list of the top three names for Beatmania 2DX in America of all time.

1965
02:46:15,796 --> 02:46:17,437
[SPEAKER_25]: Say hello to DarkSakura!

1966
02:46:17,977 --> 02:46:19,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh shit, my clothes are done.

1967
02:46:19,198 --> 02:46:20,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Say hello to Loki!

1968
02:46:22,220 --> 02:46:24,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Say hello to DDR Angel!

1969
02:46:25,742 --> 02:46:26,542
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, hi.

1970
02:46:26,622 --> 02:46:28,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Say hello to Arcadia42!

1971
02:46:28,503 --> 02:46:30,685
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, wow, man.

1972
02:46:30,765 --> 02:46:34,207
[SPEAKER_05]: And say hello to Barker'sBeautyExplicit!

1973
02:46:34,327 --> 02:46:35,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Motherfucker!

1974
02:46:35,388 --> 02:46:36,008
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1975
02:46:39,590 --> 02:46:40,851
[SPEAKER_05]: And now, introducing...

1976
02:46:42,705 --> 02:46:43,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Sky!

1977
02:46:43,505 --> 02:46:43,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

1978
02:46:44,065 --> 02:46:44,425
[SPEAKER_05]: Here I am.

1979
02:46:45,446 --> 02:46:47,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that I use two voices or anything.

1980
02:46:47,306 --> 02:46:47,526
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1981
02:46:48,006 --> 02:46:51,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go around and see what everybody came up with, and I'm going to write them down here.

1982
02:46:51,427 --> 02:46:53,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember, chat room, you guys have the final say.

1983
02:46:53,988 --> 02:47:03,250
[SPEAKER_05]: And in great reality radio fare, there's an elimination round where we're going to take out some of the ones that we deem to be crappy.

1984
02:47:04,631 --> 02:47:04,911
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1985
02:47:04,951 --> 02:47:05,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's hear it.

1986
02:47:06,031 --> 02:47:07,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie, number three.

1987
02:47:08,672 --> 02:47:09,912
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't believe it's not BB and GDX.

1988
02:47:12,322 --> 02:47:14,744
[SPEAKER_24]: I can't believe it's not B-Mania 2DX!

1989
02:47:20,048 --> 02:47:20,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Why that name?

1990
02:47:21,530 --> 02:47:22,010
[SPEAKER_05]: Any reason why?

1991
02:47:23,291 --> 02:47:24,012
[SPEAKER_15]: Because it's not.

1992
02:47:25,433 --> 02:47:25,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki!

1993
02:47:26,293 --> 02:47:26,754
[SPEAKER_05]: You're number three.

1994
02:47:27,995 --> 02:47:28,956
[SPEAKER_05]: Super Toast!

1995
02:47:31,157 --> 02:47:32,418
[SPEAKER_05]: Super Toast!

1996
02:47:32,899 --> 02:47:34,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Any reason why you're calling it Super Toast?

1997
02:47:35,261 --> 02:47:36,802
[SPEAKER_24]: Because it's better than normal toast.

1998
02:47:42,433 --> 02:47:44,414
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, DDR Angel, you're number three.

1999
02:47:45,675 --> 02:47:46,435
[SPEAKER_05]: She needs more time.

2000
02:47:46,515 --> 02:47:47,656
[SPEAKER_05]: You got a number three at least?

2001
02:47:47,836 --> 02:47:48,336
[SPEAKER_05]: You got one?

2002
02:47:49,656 --> 02:47:51,657
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, Jamie can scream at it now.

2003
02:47:53,698 --> 02:47:53,978
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

2004
02:47:54,319 --> 02:47:54,739
[SPEAKER_13]: You could.

2005
02:47:55,219 --> 02:47:55,719
[SPEAKER_13]: It's funny.

2006
02:47:56,459 --> 02:47:59,721
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, I don't know if Rob's going to laugh when you say it already.

2007
02:47:59,741 --> 02:48:00,541
[SPEAKER_13]: Just say it already.

2008
02:48:00,981 --> 02:48:02,102
[SPEAKER_13]: Spinning Tatoo Master.

2009
02:48:03,223 --> 02:48:04,063
[SPEAKER_25]: Spinning what?

2010
02:48:04,583 --> 02:48:05,323
[SPEAKER_13]: No, that's not right.

2011
02:48:05,444 --> 02:48:06,264
[SPEAKER_13]: Spinning Tatoo Mania.

2012
02:48:07,705 --> 02:48:09,406
[SPEAKER_15]: Spinning Tarou Mania!

2013
02:48:10,326 --> 02:48:13,308
[SPEAKER_15]: Why would I laugh at a Final Fantasy XI joke?

2014
02:48:19,051 --> 02:48:19,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

2015
02:48:20,871 --> 02:48:30,556
[SPEAKER_05]: My number three pick, because I was thinking that they want to actually sell copies of this game, so they'd have to borrow from another franchise.

2016
02:48:30,576 --> 02:48:33,538
[SPEAKER_05]: So my number three pick for a name would be Rumble Roses 2.

2017
02:48:37,080 --> 02:48:38,801
[SPEAKER_05]: Rumble Roses 2!

2018
02:48:42,884 --> 02:48:48,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, uh, Arcadian42 and Xplizit, what number 3 name did you come up with?

2019
02:48:48,427 --> 02:48:49,488
[SPEAKER_05]: We're gonna do it separately.

2020
02:48:51,149 --> 02:48:52,430
[SPEAKER_05]: You can do it separately, that's fine.

2021
02:48:52,450 --> 02:48:54,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, you're number 3, Arcadian.

2022
02:48:54,391 --> 02:48:57,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, uh, play it to these stupid Americans.

2023
02:48:57,213 --> 02:48:59,634
[SPEAKER_25]: It's gonna be, it's like keys and stuff!

2024
02:49:01,115 --> 02:49:03,416
[SPEAKER_25]: It's like keys and stuff!

2025
02:49:09,099 --> 02:49:11,360
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, explicit, your number three pick.

2026
02:49:12,541 --> 02:49:16,323
[SPEAKER_17]: My number three pick would be Beatbox Revolution.

2027
02:49:19,424 --> 02:49:21,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Beatbox Revolution!

2028
02:49:21,606 --> 02:49:22,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Any reason why?

2029
02:49:24,747 --> 02:49:26,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that's gross sounding.

2030
02:49:26,828 --> 02:49:28,309
[SPEAKER_05]: I explained it.

2031
02:49:29,930 --> 02:49:31,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's go on to our number two picks.

2032
02:49:32,551 --> 02:49:33,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Starting off with Jamie.

2033
02:49:36,038 --> 02:49:37,019
[SPEAKER_25]: Button Smashing Game.

2034
02:49:37,579 --> 02:49:39,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Button Smashing Game!

2035
02:49:43,645 --> 02:49:44,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, your number two pick.

2036
02:49:49,870 --> 02:49:55,555
[SPEAKER_05]: I would go with... He puts a lot of work into this, you guys.

2037
02:50:00,089 --> 02:50:04,353
[SPEAKER_05]: It's gonna be, um, how about just Turntable Mania?

2038
02:50:04,834 --> 02:50:06,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Turntable Mania!

2039
02:50:08,297 --> 02:50:08,978
[SPEAKER_05]: God, that sucks.

2040
02:50:09,458 --> 02:50:10,099
[SPEAKER_05]: I gotta think of a better one.

2041
02:50:10,279 --> 02:50:12,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Angel, your number two pick.

2042
02:50:13,762 --> 02:50:14,663
[SPEAKER_13]: This one sucks, too.

2043
02:50:14,984 --> 02:50:15,164
[SPEAKER_13]: Ah!

2044
02:50:15,384 --> 02:50:16,485
[SPEAKER_13]: DJ Spin Master.

2045
02:50:17,386 --> 02:50:19,188
[SPEAKER_00]: DJ Spin Master!

2046
02:50:25,373 --> 02:50:33,396
[SPEAKER_05]: My number two pick, again, going with the theme of they actually want to sell copies of this game in the US, would be MTV Presents Britney Mania 2005.

2047
02:50:35,497 --> 02:50:36,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Brit Mania, for short.

2048
02:50:44,340 --> 02:50:45,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, moving on.

2049
02:50:45,320 --> 02:50:47,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go to Arcadian 42.

2050
02:50:47,481 --> 02:50:49,642
[SPEAKER_06]: Something a bit more normal.

2051
02:50:49,822 --> 02:50:50,922
[SPEAKER_06]: Feel the Beat Mania.

2052
02:50:51,642 --> 02:50:53,543
[SPEAKER_05]: Feel the Beat Mania!

2053
02:50:59,921 --> 02:51:01,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretend you're a real DJ, but not...

2054
02:51:30,031 --> 02:51:32,852
[SPEAKER_25]: Pretend you're a real DJ, but not!

2055
02:51:34,952 --> 02:51:36,452
Is it but not or but you're not?

2056
02:51:38,413 --> 02:51:39,313
[SPEAKER_15]: I had that, but not really.

2057
02:51:43,054 --> 02:51:45,895
[SPEAKER_23]: Pretend you're a real DJ, but not really!

2058
02:51:47,135 --> 02:51:47,955
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, you're number one.

2059
02:51:49,895 --> 02:51:51,896
[SPEAKER_05]: I had to think long and hard on this, okay.

2060
02:51:54,336 --> 02:51:56,197
[SPEAKER_24]: It's Super Monkey Wombat Cheese Burrito.

2061
02:51:58,459 --> 02:52:12,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Super Monkey Wombat Cheese Burrito Any particular reason why you want to call a video game with falling bars Super Monkey Wombat Cheese Burrito?

2062
02:52:16,029 --> 02:52:17,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it fits.

2063
02:52:17,490 --> 02:52:18,170
[SPEAKER_05]: You're an idiot.

2064
02:52:18,270 --> 02:52:19,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Angel.

2065
02:52:19,611 --> 02:52:24,114
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, if he's an idiot, my next one's not that much better, but I thought it was funny.

2066
02:52:24,894 --> 02:52:27,696
[SPEAKER_13]: From a total noob's perspective Oh shit, there's too much to do!

2067
02:52:27,836 --> 02:52:28,136
[SPEAKER_13]: The game.

2068
02:52:30,362 --> 02:52:30,983
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh shit!

2069
02:52:31,043 --> 02:52:32,324
[SPEAKER_00]: There's too much to do!

2070
02:52:32,845 --> 02:52:33,485
[SPEAKER_00]: The game!

2071
02:52:41,794 --> 02:52:42,675
[SPEAKER_05]: My number one pick...

2072
02:52:43,953 --> 02:52:49,177
[SPEAKER_05]: My number one pick, I think, really encompasses what the game is really all about.

2073
02:52:49,677 --> 02:52:58,684
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I've been playing Bomani for a long, long time, and I've been looking at the forums and everything, and I think I've captured the name that really shows what this game is all about.

2074
02:52:58,724 --> 02:53:02,647
[SPEAKER_05]: So my number one pick, Elitist Elitist Revolution.

[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's not me.

02:53:23,212 --> 02:53:24,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Turntablist King!

2081
02:53:28,196 --> 02:53:28,756

[SPEAKER_00]: DJ Chasm, the international finger-banging music game.

2088
02:54:01,129 --> 02:54:07,627
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, boy, we have a whole lot on this list here, and six of them are going to come off this list right now.

2089
02:54:07,688 --> 02:54:08,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me read the list here.

2090
02:54:09,562 --> 02:54:37,800
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't believe it's not Beatmania 2DX, Super Toast, Spinning Taru Mania, Rumble Roses 2, It's Like Keys and Stuff, Beatbox Revolution, Button Smashing Game, Turntable Mania, DJ Spinmaster, MTV Presents, Britney Mania 2005, Feel the Beat Mania, Mix It Up, Pretend You're a Real DJ But Not Really, Super Monkey Wombat Cheese Burrito, Oh Shit There's Too Much To Do, The Game, Elitist Elitist Revolution, Turntablist King,

2092
02:54:41,843 --> 02:54:44,926
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie, one of these sadly has to come off the list.

2093
02:54:45,126 --> 02:54:46,046
[SPEAKER_05]: What's coming off?

2094
02:54:47,728 --> 02:54:48,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Super Toast.

2095
02:54:48,829 --> 02:54:51,331
[SPEAKER_05]: Super Toast is toast.

2096
02:54:54,053 --> 02:54:55,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, which one of these is coming off the list?

2097
02:54:57,656 --> 02:55:03,420
[SPEAKER_24]: Sadly, Beatbox Revolution because there is a beatboxing game coming out and that's not beatboxing.

2098
02:55:06,463 --> 02:55:07,784
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's another reason I'm there.

2099
02:55:09,867 --> 02:55:13,109
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, Angel, which one of these has to come off the list?

2103
02:55:29,300 --> 02:55:31,982
[SPEAKER_05]: As much as I love Final Fantasy XI, even 2DX isn't that good.

2104
02:55:33,043 --> 02:55:33,483
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, I know.

2105
02:55:33,683 --> 02:55:36,125

02:55:41,504 --> 02:55:49,090
[SPEAKER_05]: MTV presents Britney Mania 2005 because, in the words of Arcadian 42, it's so over.

2109
02:55:51,151 --> 02:55:51,692
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

2110
02:55:53,513 --> 02:55:55,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Britney is so last year, okay?

2111
02:55:56,115 --> 02:55:57,736

02:55:58,937 --> 02:56:03,358
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to get on the forums and tell those Orange Lines Radio people that Britney is so 2003, okay?

2113
02:56:04,539 --> 02:56:07,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Jonas, you're the last one to get to eliminate something off the list.

2114
02:56:07,180 --> 02:56:07,560
[SPEAKER_05]: What is it?

2115
02:56:08,600 --> 02:56:10,621
[SPEAKER_17]: I hate to say this, but I'll have to say Rumble Roses 2.

2116
02:56:12,641 --> 02:56:13,562
[SPEAKER_05]: You bastard!

2117
02:56:13,862 --> 02:56:16,122
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the best name on there.

2118
02:56:16,923 --> 02:56:20,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Rumble Roses 2 is off the list.

2119
02:56:22,362 --> 02:56:22,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

2120
02:56:24,123 --> 02:56:24,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Here we go.

2121
02:56:25,444 --> 02:56:31,427
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to paste the list in the chat room and you guys can send a private message with your vote right now.

2122
02:56:31,447 --> 02:56:31,827

02:56:41,771 --> 02:56:42,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Button smashing game.

2137
02:57:27,557 --> 02:57:32,061
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of my very favorite 2DX songs of all time, and I want to play this so you guys can deal.

[SPEAKER_00]: Hiho, Kermit the E-Fog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to announce...

2153
03:01:49,420 --> 03:01:52,221
[SPEAKER_00]: The top three lists of all time!

2154
03:01:54,821 --> 03:01:58,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Names that we would call Beatmania 2DX here in America.

2155
03:01:59,682 --> 03:02:01,202
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a very close vote tonight.

2156
03:02:01,262 --> 03:02:03,143
[SPEAKER_02]: Very, very, very, very close vote tonight.

[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you everybody for playing.

2162
03:02:37,562 --> 03:02:39,684
[SPEAKER_05]: Listless is not a Mark Goodson production.

2163
03:02:44,215 --> 03:02:47,036
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so I guess that's going to wrap it up for the show, you guys.

2164
03:02:47,856 --> 03:02:49,777
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that sums it up for me there.

2165
03:02:49,817 --> 03:02:51,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Elitist, elitist revolution.

2166
03:02:51,258 --> 03:02:53,338
[SPEAKER_05]: And on that note, our show is over.

03:02:55,379 --> 03:02:56,059
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's already.

2169
03:02:56,079 --> 03:02:56,720
[SPEAKER_05]: It's past 9.30.

2170
03:02:57,020 --> 03:02:58,820
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 9.34 over there.

2171
03:02:58,840 --> 03:03:00,261
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we've got to get this wrapped up.

2172
03:03:00,861 --> 03:03:04,182
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so we've got to go around and get everybody's final thought.

2173
03:03:04,262 --> 03:03:05,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, everybody, for tuning in tonight.

2174
03:03:05,763 --> 03:03:08,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Next week, more presents.

2175
03:03:10,137 --> 03:03:11,878
[SPEAKER_05]: More of Jamie's Laundry next week.

2176
03:03:11,938 --> 03:03:12,418
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, maybe.

2177
03:03:12,618 --> 03:03:12,938
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2178
03:03:13,579 --> 03:03:16,460
[SPEAKER_05]: And a new end of the year special.

2179
03:03:16,600 --> 03:03:18,621
[SPEAKER_05]: And that means, of course, we've got to do this again.

2180
03:03:18,661 --> 03:03:21,002
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got to do a list list for the best Bomani song of the year.

2181
03:03:21,582 --> 03:03:22,523
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's going to be a big one.

2182
03:03:22,583 --> 03:03:23,743
[SPEAKER_05]: So more information to come on that.

2183
03:03:23,763 --> 03:03:24,924
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope you guys can join us for that.

2184
03:03:25,644 --> 03:03:29,166
[SPEAKER_05]: And much more to come next week on Orange Launch Radio.

2185
03:03:29,206 --> 03:03:30,846
[SPEAKER_05]: More information on Night Style if we get it.

2186
03:03:31,727 --> 03:03:33,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie wants to give her final thought right now.

2187
03:03:33,528 --> 03:03:34,388
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Jamie, your final thought.

2188
03:03:35,484 --> 03:03:39,385
[SPEAKER_15]: I wish I were home so I could change into my freshly washed pajama bottoms.

2189
03:03:40,225 --> 03:03:42,285
[SPEAKER_15]: They're comfy and soft and smell like gain.

2190
03:03:43,505 --> 03:03:44,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Drive around in your pajama bottoms.

2191
03:03:44,886 --> 03:03:45,386
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I do.

2192
03:03:45,406 --> 03:03:50,767
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, she's holding it to her face like a gas mask.

2193
03:03:51,087 --> 03:03:52,227
[SPEAKER_05]: I exquisite your final thought.

2194
03:03:54,527 --> 03:03:55,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Can't hear you, buddy.

2195

[SPEAKER_05]: I can't hear him.

2197
03:04:00,868 --> 03:04:01,449

[SPEAKER_05]: Quick, quick.

2199
03:04:02,369 --> 03:04:03,469
[SPEAKER_05]: No, he has to walk over here.

2200
03:04:03,789 --> 03:04:04,089
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

03:04:28,330 --> 03:04:30,092
[SPEAKER_05]: Cross your fingers, we'll have to play the whole damn fine.

2211
03:04:32,842 --> 03:04:40,627
[SPEAKER_24]: I gotta buy me one of those bootleg Nintendo things in the mall because they're still selling them even though they got in trouble for that shit.

2212
03:04:41,008 --> 03:04:46,631
[SPEAKER_24]: Then I gotta look at my cabinet because my cabinet's lonely and needs more interfaces.

2213
03:04:48,232 --> 03:04:52,115
[SPEAKER_05]: And my final thought for tonight, everybody, is bootay.

2214
03:04:54,494 --> 03:04:58,877
[SPEAKER_24]: My final thought is Super Monkey Wombat Cheese Burrito.

2215
03:04:59,018 --> 03:05:00,419
[SPEAKER_05]: Which didn't get a single vote, by the way.

2216
03:05:00,439 --> 03:05:01,399
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

2217
03:05:02,220 --> 03:05:02,841
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't care.

2218
03:05:03,141 --> 03:05:04,882
[SPEAKER_24]: It will have a special place in my heart.

2219
03:05:07,684 --> 03:05:10,667
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that'll be the time you're getting your 12th bypass.

2220
03:05:12,028 --> 03:05:13,569
[SPEAKER_05]: They have to have that surgically removed.

2221
03:05:15,543 --> 03:05:18,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright guys, thanks for staying a little bit long with us tonight.

2222

2277
03:10:31,184 --> 03:10:41,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio, the post-show, or the afterbirth, as we so lovingly called it for these past two and a half years, where we talk about all that other stuff that we didn't get to quite on the show.

2278
03:10:41,927 --> 03:10:43,627
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't believe we've been doing it this long.

2279

[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, it's seriously time to quit.

2280
03:10:45,047 --> 03:10:46,388

2281
03:10:46,448 --> 03:10:47,028
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm kidding.

2282
03:10:47,628 --> 03:10:48,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Quitter, quitter.

2283
03:10:48,668 --> 03:10:49,569
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be doing this right.

2284
03:10:49,649 --> 03:10:50,849
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I got a fortune cookie today.

2285
03:10:50,869 --> 03:10:51,469
[SPEAKER_05]: It was really weird.

2286
03:10:51,529 --> 03:10:55,510
[SPEAKER_05]: It said something about, like, something you are focusing on, and I was thinking about Orange Lounge Radio when I read it.

2287
03:10:55,530 --> 03:10:59,331
[SPEAKER_05]: It said something you are focusing on, it will grow a lot in this next year.

2288
03:10:59,926 --> 03:11:01,128
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be very interesting to see what happens.

2289
03:11:03,030 --> 03:11:04,552
[SPEAKER_05]: Although we have a really boring webcam.

2290
03:11:04,572 --> 03:11:06,594
[SPEAKER_05]: We seriously need to start pointing that somewhere else.

2291
03:11:06,674 --> 03:11:08,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, we need to get a goldfish or something.

2292
03:11:09,778 --> 03:11:12,502
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, when you were reading that fortune, I was thinking of my penis, so...

2293
03:11:17,118 --> 03:11:18,360
[SPEAKER_05]: I had so much food today.

2294
03:11:18,380 --> 03:11:20,443
[SPEAKER_05]: I went to Panda Express and I ate like a three combo.

2295
03:11:21,103 --> 03:11:22,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you break the webcam?

2296
03:11:22,325 --> 03:11:22,926
[SPEAKER_05]: Way to go.

2297
03:11:24,248 --> 03:11:25,029
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so awesome.

2298
03:11:27,952 --> 03:11:29,194
[SPEAKER_05]: That wasn't Jamie, that was me.

2299
03:11:29,795 --> 03:11:30,375
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can believe it.

2300
03:11:31,121 --> 03:11:31,861
[SPEAKER_05]: You're belchy.

2301
03:11:32,161 --> 03:11:32,401
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

2302
03:11:32,901 --> 03:11:33,642
[SPEAKER_05]: I am going home, bye.

2303
03:11:34,022 --> 03:11:34,742
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going home?

2304
03:11:35,602 --> 03:11:35,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Fine.

2305
03:11:36,302 --> 03:11:37,943
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to go home to my life.

2306
03:11:38,363 --> 03:11:39,903
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, you're going to E3s next year, right?

2307
03:11:40,784 --> 03:11:41,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah.

2308
03:11:41,264 --> 03:11:43,884
[SPEAKER_05]: If we end up deciding to go to The Price is Right, will you go?

2309
03:11:44,045 --> 03:11:48,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Because hearing Come On Down made me think of, you know, when I went to The Price is Right a couple years ago.

2310
03:11:48,426 --> 03:11:49,526
[SPEAKER_05]: It was so much fun.

2311
03:11:49,786 --> 03:11:50,186
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

2312
03:11:50,986 --> 03:11:51,847
[SPEAKER_05]: And Loki, you're going to go too?

2313
03:11:52,287 --> 03:11:53,507
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to go before he dies.

2314
03:11:53,647 --> 03:11:55,027
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, what if I'm a contestant?

2315
03:11:55,088 --> 03:11:59,529
[SPEAKER_05]: We all have to wear... Oh my god, if you were a contestant on that show, I'd pee myself because you'd be so shy.

2316
03:11:59,549 --> 03:12:00,029
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd pee if I died.

2317
03:12:01,149 --> 03:12:02,750
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd be like, yeah.

2318
03:12:02,970 --> 03:12:03,950
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh my god!

2319
03:12:05,430 --> 03:12:07,471
[SPEAKER_15]: I wouldn't be one of those screamy, happy, clappy people.

2320
03:12:07,531 --> 03:12:08,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, hi, you girls are ugly!

2321
03:12:10,572 --> 03:12:13,032
[SPEAKER_15]: I wouldn't be one of those screamy, happy, clappy people.

2322
03:12:13,452 --> 03:12:15,033
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd be like, wow.

2323
03:12:17,413 --> 03:12:18,894
[SPEAKER_15]: I suppose I'd pick this.

2324
03:12:19,034 --> 03:12:20,554
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd have an orgasm and you'd know it.

2325
03:12:20,794 --> 03:12:21,334
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I wouldn't.

2326
03:12:21,694 --> 03:12:22,214
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't touch me.

2327
03:12:22,935 --> 03:12:23,935
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh my god, you're orange.

2328
03:12:25,915 --> 03:12:27,816
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to go, and we all should wear matching shirts.

2329
03:12:28,780 --> 03:12:32,642
[SPEAKER_05]: and we can hype it up on the station and have it be the big Orange Lounge Radio television debut.

2330
03:12:32,862 --> 03:12:34,423
[SPEAKER_15]: I did internet radio.

2331
03:12:35,604 --> 03:12:36,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, hype it up.

2332
03:12:36,224 --> 03:12:37,765
[SPEAKER_05]: The Orange Lounge Radio television debut.

2333
03:12:37,925 --> 03:12:38,526
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that idea.

2334
03:12:39,606 --> 03:12:39,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

2335
03:12:40,447 --> 03:12:41,147
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see what happens.

2336
03:12:41,667 --> 03:12:43,929
[SPEAKER_15]: Except when one of us walks behind the G4 camera.

2337
03:12:46,991 --> 03:12:48,531
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

2338
03:12:48,591 --> 03:12:49,392
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a good night, Jamie.

2339
03:12:49,432 --> 03:12:49,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for coming.

2340
03:12:50,473 --> 03:12:51,913
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody else want to add anything?

2341
03:12:51,953 --> 03:12:54,455
