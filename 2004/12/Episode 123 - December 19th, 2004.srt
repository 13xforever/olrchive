1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,900
Together like the birds of a feather would be

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:09,100
Let's take that world before it and sing a chorus or two

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:14,000
Come on let's start me where the birds play right together with you

We're gladdening along with the song of the wind

11
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
To be fabulous

12
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Our chicks are nice and rosy

13
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And comfy and cozy, are we?

14
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
We're snuggled up together like the birds of a feather would be

15
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Let's take that cold before we can sing another song or two

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Come on, it's lovely weather for us Play right together with you

00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,760
Well I figured you might watch that.

43
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,760
If you have time for Iron Chef, you have time for this.

44
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,760

00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,980
We all know he may not be here. He's got no pressure to come back at any particular time

00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,380

The years of Christmas is here

Christmas is here

74
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:51,140
Night falls on you

75
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:58,140
And if you hold me near you

76
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:03,140
My heart is beating, but you won't let me down

77
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:07,140
Nightfall is my time

78
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:10,140
I'm falling, snow is falling

79
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:14,140
I'm a thousand feet, heart is flowing

80
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:19,140
Christmas is here

81
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:51,140
You guys know what? The chat room was demanding more Silent Hill, so here you go.

82
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:37,140
I cry out of my head And I don't know what I've found

83
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:47,140
Over and over, I feel a great mental

84
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:52,140
Waiting for a gentle wave

85
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:57,140
A gentle wave, a gentle wave

86
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:02,140
On the sidewalk, on the city, on the streets, just don't whisper

87
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:07,140
Busy people, goin' nowhere, see me talkin' no rain

88
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:12,140
Not for passion, nothin' matters, my resistance is waning

89
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:21,140
Like a flower in a basement waiting for our love, yeah

90
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:59,140
It's got to fall over The rain that blows in the wind is dancing

91
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:06,140
It would be a much better fight With you, with me

92
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:13,140
If you hadn't met me, I'd be fine on my own, baby

93
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:19,140
Never felt so lonely then you came along

94
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:22,140
So now what should I do?

95
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:25,140
I'm strung out, addicted to you

96
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:29,140
My body aches now that you're gone

97
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:34,140
My surprise fell through

98
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:39,140
And they gave me everything you had and more

99
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,140
It craves my happiness

100
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:45,140
When you made me feel joy and made you smile

101
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:48,140
But now I feel your stress

102
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:53,140
Love was never meant to be such a crazy affair, no

103
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,140
And who has time but you?

104
00:13:55,140 --> 00:14:00,140
Never thought I'd sit around and unravel your love

105
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:05,140
Up until now

106
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:27,340
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 123 on your radio right now.

107
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:31,140
And I apologize to you guys if you're hearing a little bit of a buzz in the background tonight.

108
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:34,060
One of our cords, I think it's a little bit stripped, so we've got to get it replaced

109
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:38,300
and I think that stripping is causing the buzz, so we'll look into getting that replaced

110
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:43,100
before the new year, but for tonight, you're gonna have to deal with it, so I apologize.

111
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:50,100
Anyway, so here we are, almost at the end of 2004, just when I was finally remembering

112
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:54,980
to write 04 on my checks instead of 03, the damn year's almost over, and now I'm gonna

113
00:14:54,980 --> 00:15:01,100
have to start writing 05, or I'm really gonna be screwed. So, what's first, presents or

114
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,100
How was your week? How was your week?

115
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,100
Presents!

116
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,100
Presents first?

117
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,100
You mean we're going to make an exception?

118
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,100
Presents!

119
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,100
The rule that we always do?

120
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,100
Presents!

121
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,100
Alright.

122
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,100
Fair enough.

123
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,100
I mean presents are, you know.

124
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,100
Okay.

125
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,100
Now.

126
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,100
Yeah, I know.

127
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,100
Loki ran away.

128
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,100
We'll get him back.

129
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,100
Loki came home, by the way.

130
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,260
Loki came home during the break, so I don't know if he's going to be involved in this

131
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:22,740
show tonight or if he's going to be kind of in and out or whatever, but he's here and

132
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:26,940
he's trying to get our webcam up and running as well over on OrangeLaunchRadio.com, so check

133
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:27,940
that out.

134
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:28,940
Um.

135
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:29,940
Also, joining.

136
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:30,940
Because it's up and running.

137
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:35,140
it's not on the website yet. I gotta turn on the switch on the website. Also joining

138
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:39,860
us tonight, we have Arcadian 42 came in during the break. You know it's 6.30, buddy, right?

139
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:42,740
No, I'm just kidding. Do we have a mic for Arcadian? Was there another mic over there?

140
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:46,940
There should be another mic over there. There should be. Somewhere. We get it? Under the

141
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:52,900
rubble. There you go. Can you hear me? It's under the big Christmas present montage there

142
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:56,900
we have all of Loki's presents. By the way, I'd just like to point out, I have not started

143
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:01,960
my shopping yet. So, even though we are going to be doing a little bit of gifts tonight,

144
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:05,760
it just makes Christmas last longer if I don't give my gifts until next week. And then I...

145
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:09,860
That's what you're calling it. No, well, I'm not going to break my Christmas tradition

146
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:15,060
of doing all my shopping on Christmas Eve. So, sorry. Shop the day after Christmas. Or

147
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,500
that. That's even better, honestly. Because I've been telling everyone to get me gift

148
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:21,060
cards. Oh, gift cards are awesome. So I can take advantage of those with sales. Didn't

149
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:25,780
I get you a gift card last year? I think you did. I think you're probably going to get

150
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:29,700
another one this year cuz they're the easiest presents to buy. And you know what? I went

151
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:34,380
the day after Christmas. Exactly. It's a good gift to get. Alright, presents. Then, Jamie,

152
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:37,380
you better go first. What's this first present you have here? This is something from Angel.

153
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:44,500
I think it's like a couple of 40s. It's about... Is it bigger than a bread box? Uh, lengthwise,

154
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:49,500
no. Here's the thing. Jamie has to guess her present in 20 questions or less or we're gonna

155
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:56,500
smash it in front of everybody. No! No, I'm gonna... I'll guess after I open it. Alright.

156
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:03,840
It's beer. By the way, while Jamie is opening her gift, we have a request from the chat

157
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:12,760
room. At some point tonight... What'd you get, Jamie? It's the cocoa mug set with teddy

158
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:19,760
the

159
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:23,340
pro in the angel said they're going to see jamie needs a little more cute once

160
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:25,160
in awhile

161
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,120
it's very cute

162
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,460
and so i was creating a way to be happy

163
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,140
start about that

164
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:31,880
arch at room over doors are completely out yet

165

00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:59,400
know I'm an addict and everything. Mm-hmm. Is that the same thing you got, Angel? It

183
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:04,720
it is. I have been looking at that, that for three months, cause I knew three months ago

184
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:12,520
that's what I was going by for you. Aww poor Angel. I guess I'm easy to shop for, yet at

185
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:16,320
the same time very difficult. Well thank you both, it's a very, very nice thing. Thank

00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:23,440

00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:32,440

188
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:46,640
trapezoid style box. All I can see is limited guarantee. Because I need that, don't I? It's

189
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,840
a Jenny Craig gift pack. Oh, it's a case for the DS. Good, because I need one of those.

190
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,840
I really do.

191
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,840
See?

192
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,840
It's a traveling thing.

193
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,160
Ah, because I travel so damn much.

194
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,640
I got a traveling case for the DS.

195
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,280
Good.

196
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,560
It's hard, just like I like it.

197
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,560
Alright.

198
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,560
Oh, so I do get to open this?

199
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,560
Oh.

200
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,560
Okay.

201
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,960
So, it wasn't the same thing.

202
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,320
Angel was just fucking with me.

203
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,320
Alright, that's fine.

204
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,320
Fair enough.

205
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,320
Um, sure!

206
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,320
Okay, let's see.

207
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:21,320
what

208
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,560
she was totally fucking with me

209
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:29,080
uh... all my god i was just looking at this yesterday and i almost bought it

210
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,080
that is so what funny

211
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,240
it's being pals for the bs

212
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,280
kalai

213
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,240
it's a whole ds

214
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,760
it's like a it looks like a pokemon style game i can figure it out and what

215
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,280
is this game out

216
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,120
it's a mix between uh...

217
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:48,120
Pokemon and, uh, what am I trying to say, Tamagotchi, kind of.

218
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:55,120
That's cool. I wanted to check this out, so that's good. Yay!

219
00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:04,120
Thank you guys! I love you guys! Give a hug, Angel hug. Even though I have headphones on, so I can't really move. Long distance hug, baby!

220
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:08,120
Alright. Aww, can you feel the love here on Orange Lawn's radio?

221
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:13,120
Yeah. I'm so excited. I love Final Fantasy XI music, too. It's so good.

222
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,720
I figured that that would be something you'd really dig.

223
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,920
Okay, okay, look, he has to open his present now. Wait, I just want to say, this is like my favorite artwork

224
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:25,620
in all of Final Fantasy XI, by the way, is that world map that's drawn all artistic style.

225
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:29,020
That's Amano. If I could get a huge poster of that. That's Amano's art.

226
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:33,620
Is it? It's so sexy. He did all that, because I used to use one of those wallpapers

227
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,620
For the short time I played.

228
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:10,620
I tried to get a cupcake to put with him so I could give you death cake, but I didn't have time.

229
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:48,340
It's an amazing, pooping reindeer. That's lovely.

230
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:51,140
Nellie's infatuated with a pooping reindeer, apparently.

231
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,220
And you can eat the poop!

232
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:59,100
Are you going to give Nellie the poop?

233
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,740
Yeah, she can have the poop.

234
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:06,500
We're gonna put this all on the webcam, so you guys can see, during the next break, we'll

235
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,500
get to it.

236
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,740
Or actually, I'll walk over there right now, while Jamie-

237
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,780
That gives me happy Joan soda.

238
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:12,780
Is that all the gifts?

239
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:13,780
Okay.

240
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:18,180
Aw, well, there'll be more gifts next week, I promise, I promise.

241
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:21,940
Well, we're gonna just find a way to get it to you anyway, DDR Angel.

242
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,500
Alright, here we go.

243
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,500
I got a whole week.

244
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,500
Alright.

245
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,500
Hey, there's Death Pie in there.

246
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,500
Let's go back-

247
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,140
Okay, we have Death Pie.

248
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:32,260
Alright, let's go back to how we start off every show.

249
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,840
We got a little sidetracked, but presents are a good reason to sidetrack.

250
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,840
I like presents.

251
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,840
All right.

252
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,760
We're going to start off tonight's show playing a little bit of how was your week, how was

253
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,760
your day?

254
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:46,920
Well, my week was all, I was just feeling really stressed out and crappy all week.

255
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,520
I went to my last day of class on Monday.

256
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,540
I found out that I made a B in my business law class.

257
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:59,840
I made a 390 out of 400 in my Excel class, so I have a very solid A in that class.

258
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:07,560
Yeah, I made like a hundred on my final and four points on my final project too, so I'm

259
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,240
all happy and excited about that.

260
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:15,400
That means I have like a 3.2 something GPA for the semester.

261
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:21,280
I paid 300 and something dollars for my next classes, which kind of sucked, but I was really,

262
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:24,400
really stressed out all week and really exhausted.

263
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,320
And then finally, Thursday, I just collapsed at work.

264
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:34,580
I was all, you know, totally lacking in energy, and I ended up going home after half a day.

265
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:37,880
And then I tried, because I was just really sick.

266
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,980
And then I felt better the next day, so I got up to go back to work and only managed

267
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:45,260
to stay three hours before I had to come home again.

268
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:53,940
And I did nothing then but sleep and play fantasy star online for the past three days.

269
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:54,940
Nothing but that.

270
00:24:54,940 --> 00:25:01,740
so yeah I'm back to playing PSO I'm not an addict so I don't really want to play

271
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:09,220
anymore for some time I basically once I made it to level 41 in three days we're

272
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:16,740
trying to get me to ultimate so I have 40 more levels to go anyway that's

273
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:22,900
really all I did we went to this place called crickets on Auburn yesterday that

274
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:30,380
my friends were up and down was going to be the best breakfast place ever. It was just

275
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:37,540
ass. My French toast was just egg and milk on bread. I saw them put plates on top of

276
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:47,180
full plates of food. It was really disgusting. My potatoes were cold. They were nice there,

277
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:53,340
But it was just kind of crap so I wouldn't recommend anybody go there, and I'm not going there again

278
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,200
But it made my day really grumpy yesterday

279
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:00,140
I was really grumpy yesterday until I had a breakfast burrito and that made it all better

280
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:03,160
And then I played fantasy star online for about six hours

281
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:07,520
That's all I did PSO and sleep

282
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:14,620
Sounds very similar to a lot of my screen so it's very similar to a lot of my weekends, but with a different game

283
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:17,960
Eggnog is so good.

284
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:22,200
Baskin Robbins eggnog ice cream. And brand name even.

285
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:27,760
And they have pumpkin pie ice cream too.

286
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:33,860
This guy's boney ass.

287
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:38,540
Did you just make the Christmas reindeer poop on your

288
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,580
girlfriend's head?

289
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:43,460
You need to put that thing on the can.

290
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:54,820
Go put that on. Oh, make it poop in her mouth. Do it. Make it poop in her mouth. That's hot.

291
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:59,740
You should have done it on the cam. Poop. Alright, anyway. What great radio. Alright.

292
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:02,940
It's this little reindeer and in the back it's a jelly bean dispenser. Why do you have

293
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:06,540
to push it to get it to poop? Oh, you push it down and then it poops out a little jelly

294
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:10,780
bean. It's really, it's really cute. There it goes. Now you got poop on the floor. Way

295
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:11,780
Way to go.

296
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:12,780
Alright.

297
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:13,780
Angel.

298
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:14,780
DDR Angel.

299
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:15,780
How was your week?

300
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:16,780
How was your day?

301
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:17,780
Good.

302
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:24,540
I had finals on Wednesday, and I tried to start my shopping in the middle of the week,

303
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:30,220
but that thing didn't exactly go so well, so I guess I started on, what, Friday?

304
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,220
Yeah.

305
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:34,580
I believe it was Friday, or Saturday or something.

306
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:42,080
Um, I got sucked into the world in which, um, well, at least three of the people in here are hooked into.

307
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,080
Yes, Final Fantasy XI, yay me.

308
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,080
I got my hat!

309
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,080
Yay!

310
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:51,580
Even I haven't done that fucking Santa hat quest yet.

311
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,580
It's so weird here.

312
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,080
That's okay, I had a bajillion Santa hats on RO.

313
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:03,080
Are they doing those Christmas wrappy things again?

314
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:08,520
Yeah, they're doing the Christmas present ones, but I've been trying to get a Christmas

315
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:13,720
present so I can get the heart of Oppa Oppa, because I have, what Julie gave me to support

316
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:17,080
my Christmas present on PSO is I have an Oppa Oppa mag.

317
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,640
I'm going to tell you about the nerdiest thing you've ever heard in a little bit about an

318
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:24,200
online game and Christmas events, but I got to say the Christmas event on Final Fantasy

319
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,040
11 this year, not as good as last year's.

320
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,040
Last year's was awesome.

321
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,880
It was kind of fun on RO going around beating up Santa Claus.

322
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,800
Anyway, sorry Angel to cut you off.

323
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:39,800
much. The Santa hat thing was the last thing I wanted to say. Oh, the funniest part of

324
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:47,560
this week, and it happened yesterday, Miklas Hof, AKA Seagurd, totally ran past me in Windows

325
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:52,400
and he didn't even know it was me and I had to page him. I'm like, hey! He's like, hi!

326
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:57,120
I'm like, yeah, you just ran past me. He's like, I did? I'm like, yeah, you did. It was

327
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,280
funny. Anyway, whatever. Well, you know, in Popmaster Eleven sometimes if you're in a

328
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:03,360
crowded area the characters don't load all the same like you know how to take

329
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,240
like if you go into lower to know I don't know if you've been there yet but

330
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,960
there's so many people there that takes a while for a beta load so I spent five

331
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:14,760
minutes chasing him then he kind of got the hint he's like oh that's cool all

332
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:19,480
right um moving on let's go over to Loki Loki how is your week how is your day I

333
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:25,000
know you must have a busy day I'm sorry do we cut you off earlier I'm sorry I

334
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
have one more thing that happened is that your DS this is my idea how many

335
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,260
freaking people have to bring their DS's to the show? I always keep mine in my laptop

336
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:35,400
case. Alright, fine. So I can play it at work. Alright. Um, oh yeah, I ordered my Christmas

337
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:41,980
present from Dan today. Which is? Beat me into the X8 style. Hot. And the Parappa clapping

338
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:45,320
game. Do you know, do you know I just, we're going to talk about this a little later, but

339
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:51,360
you could have ordered another game on Playasia which just started taking orders. What? We'll

340
00:29:51,360 --> 00:30:03,200
talk about it in a little bit. Okay. Alright. Alright, anyway, moving on. Loki! Today I

341
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:13,200
went to my dad's house, and we had food. And, um, what else did I do this week? Oh, I went

342
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:18,440
to Lemmy's tickets, a series of unfortunate events, and that was awesome. And, I played

343
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:25,440
Law of Final Fantasy, and Christmas shopping. And, yeah, that's pretty much all I did. Just

344
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:38,120
Christmas crap, trying to get it done. And then I got some of my gifts. I got clothes

345
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:45,120
from Nellie, and I got clothes from my sister, and a $100 gift certificate to Target for

346
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,120
Yay money!

347
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:20,120
I should pass V for the first time ever, but that's nice.

348
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:24,120
Though I don't know if it's easier timing or whatever.

349
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:30,120
I'm going to pass Nebula Grasper, but it's the first time I've played it and it killed me the rest of the time.

350
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:34,120
And, uh, yeah.

351
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:38,120
Had a Christmas party at work on Friday and stuff.

352
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,120
That's it.

353
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,120
Nothing did that much today.

354
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:14,540
it was really busy we just went everywhere and you know we were just

355
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:17,660
busy non-stop and I actually got homework in the class which was kind of

356
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:19,860
weird considering you know it was training but that's what happens when

357
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:25,900
you're on salary and then you know Saturday I was hoping to go to the SVGL

358
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:30,060
3 tournament but I didn't end up going because I was just like so damn tired

359
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:33,660
and I had to do errands of my parents all this other stuff so I didn't end up

360
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:39,500
going and I sorry angel because I know you wanted to go but she seems okay with

361
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:44,260
it. And I'm sorry to everybody out there who was hoping to, or I should say I was hoping

362
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:51,180
to run into it at Spigle 3. But I just, I got beat out by wanting to sit at home and

363
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:55,580
just recuperate, so that's exactly what I did. And I played a lot of Final Fantasy 11.

364
00:32:55,580 --> 00:33:00,560
In fact, what ended up happening is that Saturday, here's that nerdy thing I was talking about.

365
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:04,240
My link shell, Final Fantasy 11, you know that's the group that you belong to, we all

366
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,820
met up and we had a level 1 foot race, which means we took a level 1 character and took

367
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:12,780
them to the most difficult areas of the game. Well, not the most, but some of the more difficult

368
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:15,900
areas of the game where you get killed in one hit if you're a level one character. And

369
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:20,860
we raced from, for those of you that play the game, we raced from Selbina to Juno. It

370
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:25,860
was pretty cool. And I was winning for a little bit there, and then I made a bad decision

371
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:30,700
on a path to go, and I came in third. But I made it alive. Loki did not make it alive,

372
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:31,700
I would just like to point out.

373
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:34,700
I was in the lead. I was in the lead, so I got taken out.

374
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:38,700
Yeah, he said he was in the lead, so he got taken out.

375
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:43,700
And then we had, get this, a Final Fantasy XI gift exchange.

376
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:47,700
Once we all got to Juno. We all had a secret person we were supposed to buy gifts for,

377
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,700
so we had a secret Santa in Final Fantasy XI.

378
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:55,700
And I got a plus one silver hairpin and a dagger.

379
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,700
That is the nerdiest thing, isn't it?

380
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:03,260
I didn't get anything you know what actually I know you did and I think I

381
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:08,100
know who has you too but it's just that our little shell master or I shouldn't

382
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:11,660
say shell master but event organizer because Loki's the shell master but our

383
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:15,620
event organizer needs to get up off her ass and get the rest of the gifts

384
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:20,580
distributed to those that weren't here so that's what will happen all right

385
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:25,980
anyway so that's my nerdy final fantasy 11 story what can I say all right

386
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:29,980
Anybody else have anything they want to add about their week, their day, anything like that?

387
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:33,980
I got new contacts. New contacts! Are they a different color? They don't look like it.

388
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:37,980
Well, they're not

389
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:41,980
tinted because they're not Acubutes now. They got some different kind that

390
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:45,980
helps correct for Acetagamism or something. Okay, so is everything a little

391
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:49,980
clearer now? Well, better than when I had those glasses.

392
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:53,980
How many fingers am I holding up?

393
00:34:53,980 --> 00:35:00,980
Alright. I'll give it back to you. I got it back, alright.

394
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:07,460
Uh, anyway. We're such great radio. This is great. What have we done tonight that's been

395
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:11,340
great radio bits? How many fingers am I holding up? That's a great radio bit. Uh, poop in

396
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:14,020
my mouth, that's a really good radio bit. Pick-a-Chat!

397
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:23,020
Pick-o-Chat? That's a really great radio event. Let's play Radio Charades. This, this is why

398
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:30,020
this is why they laugh at our faces at E3 and go, ha, internet radio for games, you

399
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:37,540
losers. Yeah, I'm going to poop in your mouth at E3, alright, I see how you like it. Alright,

400
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:44,700
we have some big Bawani news this week. It involves a little series you know of games

401
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:51,180
called Beat Mania 2DX, you might be familiar with that. Night Style has been announced,

402
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,600
it's coming

403
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,400
and more details on that

404
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:59,280
after this break featuring some music from the 2DX night style

405
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:06,280
We'll be back after this.

406
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,280
Lord, who the fuck is this?

407
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,280
You're also nothing to fear

408
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,280
Or die

409
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,280
I can't lie, I'm a killer

410
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:45,280
I am a naked guy

411
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,280
I can't lie, I'm a killer

412
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:52,280
I am a naked guy

413
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:55,280
Even though they're gonna see that I

414
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:23,280
One more time for the bad boys, babe One more time for the bad boys, babe

415
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:33,680
1 more stop for the backward rap

416
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:37,080
1 more stop for the backward rap

417
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,940
1 more stop for the backward rap

418
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:40,680
1 more stop for the backward rap

419
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,080
1 more stop for the backward rap

420
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,680
1 more stop for the backward rap

421
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,180
1 more stop for the backward rap

422
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:47,040
1 more stop for the backward rap

423
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,880
1 more stop for the backward rap

424
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,680
1 more stop for the backward rap

425
00:41:51,680 --> 00:42:21,060
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

426
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:27,560
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and we've been playing PictoChat during the break

427
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:31,960
because we're such dorks, I don't really have a better explanation other than that. But

428
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:35,880
if you've been keeping an eye on our webcam, www.orangeloungeradio.com, I did put up a

429
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:39,200
picture of the pooping reindeer during the break there, as well as a little glimpse of

430
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:44,360
PictoChat. Wait, what'd you find out, Ellie?

431
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:47,180
I think you shoved the poop right back up their ass.

432
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:54,180
you shove the poop back in their ass? Force it in like this. This is like a poop enema.

433
00:42:54,660 --> 00:43:00,660
Why don't you go back to Loki's room and see what else you can shove up there? Get your

434
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:07,380
hands robbed. Go to hell. Alright, anyway, as we alluded to before we went to the break

435
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:13,700
there, we do have BeatMania 2DX9 style somewhat announced for release, and I say somewhat

436
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:17,440
announced because basically all they really have to go off of right now, I should say

437
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:22,360
all we really have to go off of right now is a website that Konami of Japan has. It's

438
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:27,100
actually Konami Broadcasting and they have this page which appears to be listing some

439
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:33,080
of their new releases and on May, I'm sorry, March 24th of 2005, they have listed Beat

440
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:39,520
Mania 2DX 9th Style, which means 9th Style looks like that's all we need is confirmation

441
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,960
and the ninth style will be coming out at home for sure,

442
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:45,080
which is really good because basically we've had, what,

443
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,320
seventh style, eighth style, and now ninth style

444
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,540
all within, I mean, we had to go, like, a long time,

445
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:51,020
like, probably, what, a year and a half

446
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:52,920
with no new 2DX releases, at least?

447
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:55,120
And then suddenly seventh style, eighth style, ninth style,

448
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,880
and probably tenth style are all gonna come out

449
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,080
back to back to back.

450
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:00,500
So, well, not back to back, literally,

451
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,560
but, you know, within a pretty good distance of each other.

452
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,560
So this is pretty exciting.

453
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:07,840
So are you guys excited about this news,

454
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:12,580
So what do you, what does this make you, what do you think about, you have to come stand

455
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:13,580
on a mic, Jamie.

456
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:15,860
What do you think of this news, Angel?

457
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:19,660
Um, well, I like it.

458
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:20,660
Obviously.

459
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:23,020
Jamie is back to present her opinion.

460
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:26,460
As long as it doesn't have the shit timing problems.

461
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:30,820
You know, as long as it's not that problem, then it's cool.

462
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:34,140
It'd be an improvement over the arcade.

463
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:38,140
So basically, sorry, we're having a little bit of sound issues here, those same problems

464
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:41,820
I was talking about when the show started with the stripped wires causing us to have

465
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:43,340
a little bit of issue here.

466
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:45,380
We're going to get that recorder placed for next week.

467
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:46,380
Sorry guys.

468
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:50,340
Oh, I think I see exactly where the problem is too.

469
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:51,340
Play nice!

470
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:52,340
Anyway, yes.

471
00:44:52,340 --> 00:45:00,020
So, obviously, 2DX and the arcade had a little bit of timing problems, and I think the question

472
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:05,780
on everybody's mind is, is it going to be fixed for the home release or would they keep

473
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:10,420
it arcade accurate so that people who practice at home can take it to the arcade or what's

474
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:15,140
going to happen? I don't know. Any thoughts from a technical perspective, Loki? I know

475
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:17,700
you probably don't even care about this game, but you know, I just thought I'd get your

476
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:24,140
opinion anyway. That would be an accurate assumption. Okay, then tell me what you think.

477
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:31,560
Well, that's a new game, yay. I have a pretzel.

478
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:35,920
So, the timing problems in Ninth Style are enough to make you despise this game, Jamie,

479
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,920
or what's the deal?

480
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:43,960
Well, after seeing how bad the timing problems were, I swore I'd never play Ninth Style,

481
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:44,960
and I haven't.

482
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,500
But do you think you're going to make an exception for the home release?

483
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:51,760
If the home release doesn't have the timing problems, then I'll buy it.

484
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:57,040
enough all right um I just know I'm looking forward to with night style the

485
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:01,080
new songs because night style has probably one of my favorite song lists

486
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:07,520
of any 2dx style really I think it had my most favorite song list since at least

487
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:11,720
six style probably maybe since fifth I don't know but nice I had just so many

488
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:15,160
great songs on it that I love and I can't wait to play it at home because I

489
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:17,960
really only played night style in the arcade myself personally I think I only

490
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:23,440
played 9th style in the arcade like one time, two times? I think two times is the most times

491
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:28,000
I played 9th style in the arcade. And really when I went and played 10th style, I pretty

492
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,520
much only played 9th style songs. I was kind of one of those losers that just played those.

493
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:37,520
I played Gradius. Well I mean, that's a 10th style song though, that's not a 9th style

494
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:43,960
song. I just couldn't play on that 10th style machine. I'm excited because since we had

495
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:48,880
so many consumer songs and I don't mess with the sound right now cuz we're wait

496
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:57,040
for a break we had so many new songs on consumer style eight that's gonna be

497
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:01,680
interesting to see if we get as many on night style as well

498
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:05,480
do you guys hoping to see a lot of new consumer tracks or you just want it to

499
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:11,200
be arcade accurate bring back a lot of old songs or what any feelings on that I

500
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:14,200
I wanted to have no timing problems.

501
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:17,200
I wanted to play like 8th Style.

502
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:20,200
You don't care what the hell's in it as long as it's...

503
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:22,200
As long as it has no timing problems.

504
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,200
Because I want to play Lion Suki.

505
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:31,200
I want to see more of the ghetto fabulous dancers like in that one song, the 8th Style consumer song that has...

506
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,200
I miss the 4th Style booty dancers.

507
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,200
Bring those back?

508
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:36,200
The Geary Geary Daddy dancers.

509
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:42,440
it look like the fembots in the one video? Oh god. Can't remember any of the song. Somebody

510
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:46,240
will get it. I don't know. I'm just happy that my 8th style is going to be here at the

511
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:51,240
end of the week. So I can play the answer. So as you were saying before, you went ahead

512
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:55,760
and you ordered your 8th style. Yeah. Well you know I got a little private message in

513
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:01,040
the chat room over here saying DarkLionXVI says that actually over on Playasia right

514
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:05,840
now you can pre-order 9th style if you're so inclined. I'm not going to pre-order it

515
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:10,200
until I know that the issues are fixed.

516
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,600
Don't Be Afraid Myself is what they're saying it is.

517
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:13,600
I don't think that's it.

518
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:16,000
It was like Love Something was the name of the song.

519
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,400
Don't Be Afraid Myself had the girls dancing in the bathroom.

520
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:23,960
That's the one that's like the, I don't know, the pop video.

521
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:27,800
I'm talking about the one that had the- They were dancing in a damn locker room shower.

522
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,840
Yeah, that's not the one I'm thinking of.

523
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:34,080
I'm thinking of the one where they're all dressed up in the hippie stuff and they were

524
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:40,400
driving through Tokyo and stuff, or something. Why can't I think of the name of that song?

525
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:46,120
I'm looking it up right now because I'm so pissed I can't think of what that song is.

526
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:51,760
Love Box. Love Box. That's the song I was trying to think of. It's got a pretty dirty

527
00:48:51,760 --> 00:49:02,300
title. Yeah, Nelly's snickering over there. He said box. Alright. Anyway, so most folks

528
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:05,300
are going to be pretty excited about Nine Style. Of course, as soon as we know more

529
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:10,780
information about the game, we will be presenting it to you guys. And it's funny looking in

530
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:16,420
the chat room, they're going, love box, love box, fucking love box, god damn. You have

531
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:21,220
to remember guys, you're on a buffer. You're about 34 or 35 seconds behind everything,

532
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:28,100
so losers. Alright, I guess what we'll do is we're going to take another quick break

533
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:30,240
because it looks like we're working on some sound issues here. We're going to do a quick

534
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:35,520
break, some more 2DX9-style songs since we're so excited about this, and when we come back,

535
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:39,040
maybe we'll take some calls over the Skypline. Also, at some point tonight, we gotta do a

536
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:44,320
new list list. We have to have a cage match tonight, at some point, and we'll listen to

537
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:49,680
Jamie Belch some more. I'm sorry, it's your fault, you gave me the soda. Oh right, you're

538
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:52,860
right. This is the best stuff in the world. You're right, it's all my fault. Sugar-free

539
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:59,860
Alright, we'll be back after this you guys.

540
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:54,860
Let's go!

541
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:59,860
We'll be right back after some more music here on Orange Launch Radio.

542
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:24,860
Yay!

543
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:53,360
Survey

544
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:53,860
Survey

545
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:54,140
We will

We will

This

548
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:56,780
This

549
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:57,280
It's

550
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:58,040
The

551

And

And

579
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:12,640

And

584
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:19,620
And

585
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:21,720
I

586
00:55:51,720 --> 00:56:12,480
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and it looks like we actually fixed some of the

587
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:16,660
sound. We replaced the cord, so Logie was kind enough to do a little switcheroo there

588
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:21,260
during the break, swap the cord out, so hopefully that'll minimize those sound issues we've

589
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:24,420
been having. I notice the buzz is still there a little bit, but it doesn't sound as bad

590
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:31,420
in my monitor here, so we'll see. Thank God! Alright. Hooray for Loki! This is why we call

591
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:35,980
him the tech master. In the chatroom during that break, they were complaining, or I shouldn't

592
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:39,140
say complaining, but they were talking about some of the different night-style songs. You

593
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:42,220
have a favorite night-style song, even though the timing pushes you off, is there a favorite

594
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:47,740
night-style song you have? All of the Taku songs. Like, what, Distress and Lower World?

595
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:56,540
I'd have to say it actually distresses the best, and of course I do like Lianski.

596
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:59,580
My favorite song in 9th Style is Power Dream, because I love ping pong.

597
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:05,260
There is another one that I liked, but I don't remember the name of it, because I didn't

598
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:06,880
really keep up too much with 9th Style.

599
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:10,700
And of course Bad Boy Bass.

600
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:15,500
Everyone is something, I don't remember the song.

601
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:20,300
Alright. What we're going to do now is we're actually going to talk to somebody over the

602
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:24,620
Skype line. Somebody actually called and said they had something they wanted to talk to

603
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:29,380
us about, so we're going to go ahead and pick up the Skype line here. I just told them to

604
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:32,220
give us a call here. Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

605
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:36,300
Hey, what's up? Hi, and who is this?

606
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:38,580
It's Sherlock. Hi, Sherlock. How are you?

607
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:43,180
Doing good. How are you doing today? I'm good. For those of you folks who don't

608
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:47,580
know, Sherlock, one of the moderators over on DDR Freak, which by the way, DDR Freak,

609
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:50,300
kind enough to replay Orange Lawn's radio Friday nights.

610
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:55,580
And he has the best hat ever. The hat is pretty sexy.

611
00:57:55,580 --> 00:57:57,900
Is it now? I've seen pictures of the hat, and I think

612
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:04,580
I saw the hat from a distance at E3, but it was kind of like going to a rock concert,

613
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:08,580
and it's like, you know, I think I can kind of make it out. I think I can kind of make

614
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:11,060
out that person. It's all, you can almost see it.

615
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:14,980
You can almost see it. What's on your mind, Sherlock?

616
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:19,500
I found something online that kinda confused me a bit, but it also made me

617
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:22,460
just like spin my head, and it really

618
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:26,220
just threw me for a turn. It's DDR-related, and uh...

619
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:29,460
A lot of DDR things kinda make me question myself sometimes, but...

620
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:33,140
Yeah, I mean, you know, everyone keeps talking about, you know, is DDR dead,

621
00:58:33,140 --> 00:58:36,140
what's going on, you know, the whole April Fools thing, you know,

622
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:39,920
put everyone in for a turn, but something came up

623
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:46,080
that really confused me. If you guys go to the Konami Arcade website for DDR Extreme,

624
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:53,160
it's konami.co.jp slash am slash ddr underscore new. Brings you up to the DDR website for

625
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:54,160
DR Extreme.

626
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:58,440
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Run that by me one more time. Konami.co.jp slash...

627
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:05,600
Am slash ddr slash ddr new.

628
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:07,960
Slash ddr new. All right.

629
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:17,960
Yes, it's the Xtreme webpage, and if you look at it, the logo up top has a little Santa Claus logo in it.

630
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:26,960
Now, what I'm trying to figure out is why they decided to update a two-year-old webpage with a little Santa Claus logo.

631
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:29,960
Okay, Loki's tapping me and he says it's what?

632
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:35,960
That's fucking old, that's from like last time. That was back when they were talking about the original DDR stream coming out.

633
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:38,280
Santa Claus has been there all the time.

634
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:40,560
No it hasn't, not that I remember.

635
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:43,560
It's been there, trust me.

636
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:45,360
I've never seen that there before.

637
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:47,280
Interesting, okay now,

638
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:50,400
but I do remember that Extreme came out

639
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:54,440
at Christmas time. I do remember that. Extreme came out Christmas day in

640
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:56,060
2002, didn't it?

641
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:57,620
I want to say.

642
00:59:57,620 --> 00:59:58,800
Loki think,

643
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:01,240
Loki swears up and down it's been there the whole time.

644
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:04,040
It hasn't been, no.

645
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:06,560
Why would they keep it there over summer?

646
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:12,500
Well, I mean, but isn't, yeah, this is the journal of Naoki Madaya and stuff, why would

647
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:15,220
they bother to update this? I don't know.

648
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:17,180
I, you, Mel?

649
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:19,800
I don't know. I just, I wish I'd visited...

650
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:21,700
No, it's not the same, it's not the same and I'll tell you why.

651
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:25,020
Okay. Because the image name is

652
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:28,220
ddrex2.gif

653
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:29,020
and then

654
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:30,580
well, if you view the image

655
01:00:30,580 --> 01:00:32,520
If you take out the two

656
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:36,280
yeah if you take out the two there's the original logo

657
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:38,480
mmm so

658
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:40,240
well but when did the journal... okay

659
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:42,760
loki, loki's getting frustrated

660
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:43,920
because

661
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:47,280
that was like one of the last journals that they did on there and they changed the logo for the

662
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:48,520
last journal

663
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:49,980
ddr-ex

664
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:53,800
the uh... ex-one or whatever is for the previous journals in that series there

665
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:56,380
cause there's multiple page for that journal so

666
01:00:56,380 --> 01:00:59,320
i know there is but i don't know

667
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:03,200
old it's not anything new it's old

668
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:06,860
lucky quit ruining christmas teases

669
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:09,960
get the boy hope for this holiday season

670
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:12,640
the hell's wrong with you you bridge

671
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:16,140
all right fine if you want to go ahead and do that if you look at that picture

672
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:20,040
through a set of doctors a secret code in their case to a secret website it's

673
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:23,960
all about the background information of the vr e x two

674
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:29,760
Really? There you go, there's your conspiracy theory for the year. Is it purple?

675
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:35,120
It's not purple, it's Fuchsia!

676
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:41,440
Are you going to argue with me about colors now? Come on, it was purple.

677
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:43,400
Everybody knows

678
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:44,560
that it's going to be

679
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:51,240
DDR Fuchsia. That's the new, it's like 2DX Red, DDR Fuchsia, okay? Trust me on this.

680
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:52,500
I've got to know!

681
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:53,840
Okay, I found the code!

682
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:57,560
Can we color a little bit less homosexual? Come on!

683
01:01:57,560 --> 01:01:59,040
Hey, please!

684
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:03,400
Fine, if you really want to know what the color is, it's Super Fuchsia, but you know,

685
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:07,480
I'm not one to judge their title, okay? I don't get it.

686
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:13,920
Because the homosexual one would be Fabulous Fuchsia.

687
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:16,000
Alright, well thank you, you know what?

688
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,140
Either way, maybe...

689
01:02:18,140 --> 01:02:22,140
I guess you just have to believe in Santa Claus if you want this to be true.

690
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:26,140
I believe that little Santa Claus in the logo, alright?

691
01:02:26,140 --> 01:02:30,140
Just click your heels three times and swear you believe.

692
01:02:30,140 --> 01:02:36,140
I sincerely hope that you're onto something. I hope Loki's full of shit, but I unfortunately don't think he is in this case.

693
01:02:36,140 --> 01:02:37,140
I hope so too.

694
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:39,140
I hope he is, but I unfortunately don't think he is in this case.

695
01:02:39,140 --> 01:02:44,140
I haven't heard anyone else say otherwise, so Loki's the first one to say something wrong.

696
01:02:44,140 --> 01:02:47,140
When he says it, he says it loud. Don't let that scare you.

697
01:02:47,140 --> 01:02:48,140
Alright.

698
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:53,140
Alright, well thanks for the tip Sherlock. How are you doing otherwise?

699
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:56,140
Uh, life's had its ups and downs.

700
01:02:56,140 --> 01:03:02,140
How's DDR in New York? We don't hear a whole lot about what's going on in New York because we're in California.

701
01:03:02,140 --> 01:03:07,140
Oh God, don't get me started. Don't get me started. We had to lock the forums like two weeks back.

702
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:10,140
I'm not talking about the intro web drama.

703
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:11,140
The intro web?

704
01:03:11,140 --> 01:03:13,140
How's the scene going?

705
01:03:13,140 --> 01:03:17,140
The scene itself? Not much better, I'll give you that.

706
01:03:17,140 --> 01:03:19,140
Oh, that's a bummer.

707
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:24,140
Go out there with some defibrillators and breathe some life into DDR a little bit.

708
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:28,140
It's not changing, nothing's changed around here at all.

709
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:31,140
Sherlock, go spread the Santa rumor all around, they'll all buy it.

710
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:33,140
I will, I will, I'm going to.

711
01:03:33,140 --> 01:03:34,140
Alright, you do that.

712
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:35,140
Yeah.

713
01:03:35,140 --> 01:03:38,140
Alright, thanks for calling Sherlock, have a good one.

714
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:39,140
You too.

715
01:03:39,140 --> 01:03:40,140
Later.

716
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:46,140
Wait, hold on. It said you heard it here first, DDR Fuchsia.

717
01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:48,140
Oh my god, DDR Fuchsia.

718
01:03:48,140 --> 01:03:51,140
Alright, DDR Fuchsia.

719
01:03:51,140 --> 01:03:54,140
Well, I'm glad Sherlock decided to call the show.

720
01:03:54,140 --> 01:04:02,140
Even if he may be chasing a ghost, not unlike one of our co-hosts here on the show.

721
01:04:02,140 --> 01:04:07,140
No, he's just chasing nothing. Sorry.

722
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:13,860
it's been there okay it's been there forever ever and ever still a cringe

723
01:04:13,860 --> 01:04:19,460
all right anyway moving on I want to do a little bit of a follow-up to something

724
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:23,160
we were talking about last week Jamie this has to do with something you

725
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:27,420
brought up and it's the the girl the little girl that killed the other little

726
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:31,820
girl and now has the internet obsession going on about her yeah I have a banner

727
01:04:31,820 --> 01:04:36,100
for it yeah I just I was gonna bring that up they help is that you to go and

728
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:41,520
make a banner and a match. For those that didn't catch last week's show, just a little

729
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:42,520
catch up.

730
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:43,520
I'll put a link to it in the chat room.

731
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:48,100
Okay. Give us the Cliff Notes version. What's going on here? What happened and why is there

732
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:50,100
an internet obsession about it?

733
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:57,880
Okay. There was a girl who killed one of her classmates. In a class picture, this little

734
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:03,140
girl was wearing a University of Nevada sweatshirt. It just says Nevada all the way across. It's

735
01:05:03,140 --> 01:05:08,820
a blue sweatshirt, and there's all indications that they were friends and everything, so

736
01:05:08,820 --> 01:05:18,540
anyway, it started this whole big internet obsession, and people, and keep in mind, they're

737
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:22,740
doing her as a character, not as she herself.

738
01:05:22,740 --> 01:05:29,680
And because she was 12 years old, they couldn't prosecute her, because the age of criminal

739
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:37,040
responsibility in Japan is 14, which was actually lowered to 14 because of another child murder.

740
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:44,520
Anyway, there's tons of fan art now, tons and tons of fan art. I took one of the pictures

741
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:50,120
and made a banner out of it. You know how when people that want to be fashionable

742
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:55,080
with their banners online, they have the banner and then they have the matching little avatar

743
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:58,960
that goes with it, the little box that sits under the name? What I liked about what Jamie

744
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:02,720
didn't. Not only does she have this going on on DDR Freak, but she has it going on on

745
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:05,720
the Orange Lodge Radio Forums, as well as probably every other forum out there right

746
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:10,520
now that she frequents. She's got the little banner that has the little Nevada girl on

747
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:14,360
it, and it says Dark Sakura. And then the little avatar is the little box cutter.

748
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:19,460
It's actually from the same picture, because I wanted to get the whole thing of her holding

749
01:06:19,460 --> 01:06:23,840
the box cutter, but it didn't, the size didn't reduce the way I liked it, too. So I said,

750
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:27,440
did, you know, just her holding the box cutter. And I'm going to post them in the chat room.

751
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:31,860
Alright, you do that. You post it in chat. Or, you could check it out for yourself. Just

752
01:06:31,860 --> 01:06:36,560
go to the Orange Lounge Radio forums, and there should be a post from Jamie in there.

753
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:42,640
I have to give a cheap advertisement in there somewhere, for people to visit our dying forums.

754
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:48,960
Alright. Anyway, I want the quote thread to evolve.

755
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:55,680
In order for the quote thread to come back, people have to actually use our chat room,

756
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:56,680
don't you think?

757
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:57,680
I agree.

758
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:58,680
Which is pretty active.

759
01:06:58,680 --> 01:06:59,680
So use it already!

760
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:00,680
Geez!

761
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:04,320
Which is pretty active during the live shows, I can't complain about that, but, damn, during

762
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:08,500
the week it's a ghost town, of course, I'm pretty bad, because instead of chatting in

763
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:12,480
Orange Lounge like I should, I'm playing Final Fantasy XI.

764
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:16,200
Which is funny, Angel was mouthing that right along with me, like I was at the Rocky Horror

765
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:20,680
Picture Show or something, she was mouthing it along, because she knew I was going to

766
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:21,680
say that.

767
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:22,680
I'm dicked!

768
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:23,680
You are an addict!

769
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:25,180
I am so glad I quit that game.

770
01:07:25,180 --> 01:07:27,360
I have PSO now.

771
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:29,360
I'm sad that you quit, just so you know.

772
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:30,500
Well, you know what?

773
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:32,780
How about for Christmas you pay for me to play again?

774
01:07:32,780 --> 01:07:34,660
I'm kidding.

775
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:35,980
Yeah, how about that gift card?

776
01:07:35,980 --> 01:07:37,940
How about that Pooping Ranger?

777
01:07:37,940 --> 01:07:41,260
You know, I actually did have half of the temptation

778
01:07:41,260 --> 01:07:43,540
to reinstall it.

779
01:07:43,540 --> 01:07:44,440
Temptation's good.

780
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:46,500
And then I thought, why?

781
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:48,660
I won't have time.

782
01:07:48,660 --> 01:07:51,540
Once the school year starts again, the semester starts.

783
01:07:51,540 --> 01:07:55,060
When you get really addicted like me, you make time.

784
01:07:55,060 --> 01:07:58,380
That's what I have the gym for.

785
01:07:58,380 --> 01:07:59,340
Oh, snap.

786
01:07:59,340 --> 01:08:02,020
That's my addiction is exercise.

787
01:08:02,020 --> 01:08:06,340
My addiction is feeling fit.

788
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:09,540
I like endorphins. You need to take me to the gym sometime.

789
01:08:09,540 --> 01:08:12,700
I want to see what this is all about. Okay.

790
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:14,460
Sometime.

791
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:20,300
Let's have ourselves a cage match, shall we? Why not?

792
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:23,020
Alright, the way the Orange Launch Radio cage match works,

793
01:08:23,020 --> 01:08:27,020
We play three songs for you guys, and you guys pick your favorite song.

794
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:31,020
The winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio.

795
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:38,020
Each host picks a song, and you get to hear a clip of last week's winner, as well as two brand new songs.

796
01:08:38,020 --> 01:08:42,020
Last week in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage match, it came down to The Wire.

797
01:08:42,020 --> 01:08:46,020
It was incredibly insane. It was a three-way tie.

798
01:08:46,020 --> 01:08:51,020
A three-way tie, and it was three new songs because we had to retire a song last week.

799
01:08:51,020 --> 01:08:56,840
so DDR Angel ended up breaking the tie and a lot of folks in the chat room very

800
01:08:56,840 --> 01:09:00,680
passionate about their dislike for this song so it's gonna have a hard time

801
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:06,080
holding on tonight but we'll see we'll see maybe maybe people will see

802
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:09,760
something in the song tonight that they didn't see before I don't know but here

803
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:14,120
it is song number one you can vote for tonight it's the artist called J punch

804
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:17,120
and the song is called Bitch. Enjoy!

805
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:50,120
I can't get clean, that's right

806
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:53,120
You are a bitch

807
01:09:58,120 --> 01:10:01,120
And I hate myself

808
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:04,120
That's right

809
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:09,120
You are a bitch

810
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:11,120
You are a bitch

811
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:30,120
And I hate myself

812
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:35,120
And I tried

813
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:42,120
She gave it all up in her bed, she gave it all up in her bed, she gave it all up in her bed

814
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:25,000
All right, that was song number one in tonight's cage match, Bitch, by J-Punch, and it looks

815
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:29,360
like the chat room is about ready to take their handguns to that song.

816
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:30,360
They're bitching!

817
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:31,360
Yeah, they're bitching.

818
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:33,360
You're so funny, Jamie!

819
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:41,320
All right, let's see what's going to try and knock this bitch out of here tonight.

820
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:43,320
We'll start it off with Dark Sakura's pick.

821
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:45,320
I picked an overclocked mix.

822
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:49,320
This is good because we were talking about overclocks a little bit last week,

823
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:52,320
and how Loki is going to submit his remix any day now, right?

824
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:54,320
Uh, no I'm not actually.

825
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:57,320
Oh, what caused this change? Hold on, hold on.

826
01:11:57,320 --> 01:11:59,320
What caused the change?

827
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:06,320
It doesn't, it's not, no, it's not the type of remix to be on that site, sorry, that's it, period.

828
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:09,320
No discussion, it's not going up there.

829
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:12,320
He is not going to compromise his art.

830
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:15,320
Anyway, back to what we were talking about here.

831
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:18,320
I just realized there's a lot of crap on Overclocked, though.

832
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:21,320
A lot of really crappy remixes.

833
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:22,320
But not this song, right?

834
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:27,320
No. This one's a remix from Raiden 2, which is one of my favorite shooter games of all time.

835
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:33,320
Actually, my favorite in the series is Raiden DX, but Raiden 2 was the first one that had these electric things.

836
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:38,840
big purple line that shoots out and latches on to people and zooms around

837
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:42,520
them and I was like that was the coolest weapon in a shooting game ever. Next to

838
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:47,540
the fist in Twinbee so I had to download that and it actually turned out to be a

839
01:12:47,540 --> 01:12:51,540
pretty cool one so I don't remember the name that they named it but it's

840
01:12:51,540 --> 01:12:56,320
something from Raiden 2. I'll give you a hint the artist is TefNek and the

841
01:12:56,320 --> 01:13:00,440
song is called the Raiden 2 Airborne Overclock Mix. How's that sound?

842
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:07,440
I keep thinking Mortal Kombat sense Raiden, or Fatal Fury for that same spelling.

843
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:14,440
All right, here it is. TefNec Raiden 2 Airborne OC Remix. Enjoy.

844
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:52,880
Okay, song number two in tonight's cage match was Teth-Neck, Raiden II, Airborne.

845
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:55,240
It's a remix coming to you from Overclocked.

846
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:59,160
Let's see if that song overclocked or underclocked with the judges here in the room.

847
01:17:59,160 --> 01:18:01,160
What do you think, Jamie?

848
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:05,680
Well, I liked it, obviously, or else I wouldn't have picked it, so it gets a nine for me.

849
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:06,680
All right, fair enough.

850
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:13,680
I think I've heard it before actually, um, get the nate.

851
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:20,200
Um, Marcanium 42. Can't hear you bud, is your mic on?

852
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:22,200
Can't hear you though, did you go to the bottom there?

853
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:27,360
Eh, I don't know. Oh, he may not have plugged it back in.

854
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:34,040
Let's come back to you, Angel? Uh, I liked it, I'll give it a nate.

855
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:39,420
I thought the song was, it was very fluffy, flying on the clouds type thing, I don't know

856
01:18:39,420 --> 01:18:44,620
if it's the song I'd go like, yeah, rock on, this song, but it's cute. It's definitely

857
01:18:44,620 --> 01:18:51,220
video game ambiance type music, so I give it like a, nah, an eight, why not. Now we

858
01:18:51,220 --> 01:18:53,880
can hear you, Arcadian. Alright, where would you give that one?

859
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:56,420
It was alright. I'll give it an eight.

860
01:18:56,420 --> 01:18:59,960
Alright, an eight from Arcadian as well. Remember though, it's not up to us, it's up to you

861
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:05,240
guys in the chatroom at www.orangeslaundry.com and chat. You guys get the final say. Loki,

862
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:12,120
it's your turn. What song did you pick for us tonight? Let me give them a second try.

863
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:21,120
This is Monolithic with House of Joy, off of their newest CD, Diving the Sunfish. Alright,

864
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:28,160
more time giving them a try here in the cage match monolithic house of joy enjoy

865
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:49,120
Oh, come this morning, turn on the TV.

866
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:53,120
Turned on the TV

867
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:56,120
And what did you see?

868
01:20:56,120 --> 01:21:00,120
The calamity

869
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:03,120
Anger inside you

870
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:06,120
Swelled up unrestrained

871
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:09,120
The picture they burn

872
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:14,120
Like a torch to your brain

873
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:18,120
What happened to the world you knew?

874
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:20,120
Where's the world at?

875
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:24,120
You feel the light no longer shines on you

876
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:27,120
Like the night of observation

877
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:31,120
You think the world pounds upon your back

878
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:33,120
It's beating on my back

879
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:38,120
Like your life spreads you to the rack

880
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:42,120
Left you to die

881
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:46,120
There is no one left

882
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:53,120
You remember

883
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:59,120
You hold the key to the high store

884
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:06,120
Enter and seek out your sorrow

885
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:11,020
Here is the key to the house

886
01:22:11,020 --> 01:22:17,420
You're coming and build your tomorrow

887
01:22:17,420 --> 01:22:25,540
Is rage for you

888
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:53,540
You don't have a lot of money.

889
01:22:53,540 --> 01:22:57,540
You don't have any love in your hands

890
01:22:59,540 --> 01:23:03,540
You don't laugh anymore with this body

891
01:23:06,540 --> 01:23:10,540
You think it'd be better if God liked what he had

892
01:23:10,540 --> 01:23:39,540
You hold the key to the house, You're a war-hinter and lead by your God.

893
01:23:39,540 --> 01:23:48,540
Tomorrow, here is the key to the hardcore

894
01:23:48,540 --> 01:23:53,540
Come in and feel your tomorrow

895
01:23:53,540 --> 01:24:01,540
It waits for you

896
01:24:01,540 --> 01:24:08,540
Then the silence you reach

897
01:24:08,540 --> 01:24:13,540
I'll be waiting for you

898
01:24:13,540 --> 01:24:20,540
I'll be waiting for you

899
01:24:20,540 --> 01:24:25,540
I'll be waiting for you

900
01:24:25,540 --> 01:24:50,740
You hold a key to the house, your war is here, and these are your sorrows, here is a key

901
01:24:50,740 --> 01:24:55,040
To the hardcore

902
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:59,640
Come in and build your tomorrow

903
01:24:59,640 --> 01:25:03,040
It waits for you

904
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:08,040
It waits for you

905
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:46,040
Alright, that was song number three in tonight's cage match. Monolithic with House of Joy. Let's go around and see if that was House of Joy or House of Pain to people.

906
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:48,040
Dude, House of Pain was cool.

907
01:25:48,040 --> 01:25:50,040
Alright, let's see. Starting off with Jamie.

908
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:55,040
That guy, okay, I'm sorry, if you're going to be a professional, learn how to hold a fucking key.

909
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:56,040
Wow.

910
01:25:56,040 --> 01:25:57,040
I know!

911
01:25:57,040 --> 01:25:58,040
Politary.

912
01:25:58,040 --> 01:26:02,040
He falls, the sky falls in the same category as Politary.

913
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:04,040
Cannot hold a key.

914
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:12,040
The music was good, but the guy's voice sucked ass, so I'll split the difference and give it a 6.

915
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:43,040
The voice doesn't really bother me. I think it's cool. And I like the music a lot. Let's give it a 9 from me. Angel.

916
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:49,040
I like his stuff a lot. I have 9.

917
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:54,040
And let's see what we thought. Arcadian 42.

918
01:26:54,040 --> 01:26:56,040
It was okay. I'll give it a 6.5.

919
01:26:56,040 --> 01:27:02,520
all right so remember it's not up to us it's up to you so let's review the songs

920
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:07,680
you can vote for in tonight's cage match starting off with song number one last

921
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:11,960
week's winner bitch by J punch

922
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:30,360
Alright, and song number two in tonight's cage match was Ride Into Airborne Overclocked

923
01:27:30,360 --> 01:27:44,840
to mix and song number three in tonight's cage match was monolithic

924
01:27:44,840 --> 01:28:00,840
like House of Joy. Alright guys, you know the drill. Place vote now. Send a private

925
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:08,040
message to Skye in the chat room with your vote. Joining us late during the cage match,

926
01:28:08,040 --> 01:28:13,600
He always likes to join us say hello to explicit real name Jonas

927
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:16,120
How you doing?

928
01:28:16,120 --> 01:28:21,080
Doing fine. Just came back from the SVG l3 tournament. Well, not just now right and let's or did you just

929
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:25,080
Save you just got back now. You were there a little late. You know, it ended yesterday, right?

930
01:28:25,080 --> 01:28:33,200
I think I competed it but into I gotta know none of us went I was really hoping to go but I got lazy and

931
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:36,040
Because of my trip I got really badly burned out

932
01:28:36,040 --> 01:28:43,040
But at the same time, just keep in mind that the hype wasn't really worth all that hype.

933
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:45,040
When you talk about the hype, what do you mean?

934
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:52,040
You know how everybody says, oh it's SVGL, the biggest tournament in history. You got SVGL, I think.

935
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:54,040
When was the first SVGL, do you remember?

936
01:28:54,040 --> 01:29:00,040
First SVGL was, I don't know, a long time ago.

937
01:29:00,040 --> 01:29:11,600
SVGL 2 was 2002 in April, I suppose. And SVGL is December 2004, the third installment.

938
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:15,800
So it was the last in a long line of events then?

939
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:22,280
Yeah, supposedly the biggest tournament ever. Depending on how people's opinions are.

940
01:29:22,280 --> 01:29:29,840
Well, I'll explain later. Do you have any questions?

941
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:35,000
Not so far. I'm curious kind of what happened. How did the day go?

942
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:43,200
Well, it was a very, very long day. The PA really started at 11.45 for the qualifiers.

943
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:51,560
I think the PA ended at 6 o'clock itself. It took that long because there was some controversy

944
01:29:51,560 --> 01:29:54,320
with the pads, some people were complaining. Okay, what is this controversy, because I've

945
01:29:54,320 --> 01:30:00,480
heard about it over on DDRFreak, on the forums. They said, because they switched, I think

946
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:06,400
they switched the pads from fourth plus, or in the groove, whatever they switched the

947
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:11,240
cabinet to, for the extreme. And they said that one player's side is not working, or

948
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:15,720
I'm not really sure what's going on there. Someone said that this guy was a sore loser,

949
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:20,840
or the pads were really not working, depending on what you guys' opinions, or different play

950
01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:27,120
playstyles. I can't really opinionize on that, but it delayed a shitload of time unnecessarily.

951
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:31,320
Unfortunately, I've noticed this is kind of a trend in a lot of tournaments lately where

952
01:30:31,320 --> 01:30:35,280
somebody's complaining about the pad and then they have to do these extensive tests on it

953
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:39,840
to see if they're working or not. My advice to future people who are going to be throwing

954
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:45,160
tournaments, they have some kind of conflict resolution thing in the tournament rules that

955
01:30:45,160 --> 01:30:50,840
that says, if there is a question, this is the procedure, and that, whatever the outcome

956
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:53,240
of that procedure is, end of story, no arguing, basically.

957
01:30:53,240 --> 01:30:58,600
I know, I've really learned a lot with the SDGL3 term in organizing, even though many

958
01:30:58,600 --> 01:31:03,840
have actually said that it was very badly organized, regardless if it's true or not,

959
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:09,080
I would say it's badly organized because the time restraints, I think 2DX took way too

960
01:31:09,080 --> 01:31:13,360
long, even if there were just like five people who competed for 2DX.

961
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:18,760
only five people? Yeah, 2DX Red, I'm assuming five or eight, but it took way too long for

962
01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:25,200
its own type. Usually that's too fast for eight people. But if it was like 32, it would

963
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:31,720
take long, obviously. But yeah, around that much competed. It wasn't that many people.

964
01:31:31,720 --> 01:31:37,440
And Freestyle started hella late, but not to mention the lack of room for people to

965
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:42,640
actually compete on. It was too crowded inside, people had to sit down for the camera, it

966
01:31:42,640 --> 01:31:46,160
It was all stuffed near the machines that have a lot of sound.

967
01:31:46,160 --> 01:31:48,640
Spigal is a very interesting place to have a tournament.

968
01:31:48,640 --> 01:31:49,840
They have a machine inside?

969
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:50,840
Yeah.

970
01:31:50,840 --> 01:31:52,760
How in the hell were you able to see anything?

971
01:31:52,760 --> 01:31:55,600
Well, like I said, it was really worth the hype.

972
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:56,600
I see.

973
01:31:56,600 --> 01:31:59,880
Because the management itself is also involved.

974
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:07,680
They refuse to do certain things and certain expectations to us competitors.

975
01:32:07,680 --> 01:32:12,820
One is, yeah, of course, not everybody is satisfied, at least come to a point where

976
01:32:12,820 --> 01:32:16,120
everybody agrees in a way.

977
01:32:16,120 --> 01:32:21,440
I know Team Seattle was there, SoCal was there, some of the Sacramento people were there,

978
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:22,440
like Toady.

979
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:25,320
Yeah, I was kind of hoping he'd come tonight because no one talked to him about it because

980
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:27,280
he competed, but...

981
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:31,560
Yeah, and I competed, ugh.

982
01:32:31,560 --> 01:32:32,560
But in the world...

983
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:33,560
Well, what was that ugh for?

984
01:32:33,560 --> 01:32:36,400
Because the rules kind of got altered in a way, I wasn't really sure if that was the

985
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:41,760
rules because there was a qualifier list in SVGL3. I'm assuming... many people have

986
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:47,560
thought it was going to be practicing one of the following songs, like Highs Off You,

987
01:32:47,560 --> 01:32:53,560
Superstar, etc, etc, etc. But I chose one of the... all of the things called ExtraTuned.

988
01:32:53,560 --> 01:32:57,720
Some people may have fucked up on it. Well, I fucked up on it for some reason. It's not

989
01:32:57,720 --> 01:33:01,640
all my grace in the beginning. And some people were okay down with it, but some people were

990
01:33:01,640 --> 01:33:06,580
not really happy with the rules there. But then again, it's a competition. Don't want

991
01:33:06,580 --> 01:33:12,100
to start drama. Do the drama during the forums, but not during the tournaments. That's where

992
01:33:12,100 --> 01:33:17,460
the forums come in the after to see what they can do better. Even though 50% of the control

993
01:33:17,460 --> 01:33:23,980
is basically on SVGL's part. So how did Freestyle go? I heard Freestyle was really good. That

994
01:33:23,980 --> 01:33:28,020
there were a lot of really high level people. Well, I can't really opinionize that. There

995
01:33:28,020 --> 01:33:31,820
There were some ups and downs with freestyle.

996
01:33:31,820 --> 01:33:35,900
The ups was, it was a good competition, great competition, great competitors competed.

997
01:33:35,900 --> 01:33:45,100
Like Tequila from Omaha came all the way from there to the Bay just to compete, turned out

998
01:33:45,100 --> 01:33:46,100
very good.

999
01:33:46,100 --> 01:33:53,440
Some of the performances showed a lot of hard work in a way, especially with finals.

1000
01:33:53,440 --> 01:33:58,880
Why the hell are you going to place a fucking tournament right after college finals?

1001
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:03,680
Well, because they don't want to do it on Christmas.

1002
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:07,440
You could find a problem with almost any week that you could possibly pick, I think.

1003
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:12,440
Well, because I thought SVGL was supposed to be held during the summer, which was a

1004
01:34:12,440 --> 01:34:17,560
predicted thing, but Christmas, right before Christmas, it's finals, people are stressing

1005
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:19,440
out over freestyle section.

1006
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:25,520
can't do a routine because the freestyle in my opinion was too limited for that whole

1007
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:29,120
day because right after finals you have to work on a routine.

1008
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:34,200
It's a big pain in the ass, especially when I had finals.

1009
01:34:34,200 --> 01:34:40,640
Some people had finals like two of them on Friday and had to work immediate without sleep

1010
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:43,200
just to make sure it looks good.

1011
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:47,920
But the biggest problem with the environment of the freestyle is that they didn't put outside,

1012
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:53,640
you have a lot of air conditioning. Of course, the place itself wasn't even air conditioned.

1013
01:34:53,640 --> 01:34:58,400
The second of all, very limited space. You've got people crowding all over the pad. Some

1014
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:02,960
people wanted to do a lot of movement outside the pad, but they're limited because they've

1015
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:09,280
got people around blocking their... Even my routine got fucked over.

1016
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:13,840
How so? Because it required at least three to five

1017
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:18,120
feet of open space on my right side when I was competing.

1018
01:35:18,120 --> 01:35:26,480
Now, was it supposedly going to happen that there was going to be the machine outside?

1019
01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:27,480
Was that ever said?

1020
01:35:27,480 --> 01:35:28,480
That was a possibility.

1021
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:29,480
Although in the winter...

1022
01:35:29,480 --> 01:35:30,480
Well, SPGL2 had it.

1023
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:33,560
Yeah, but I can see where in the winter there might be rain concerns too.

1024
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:36,280
I mean, because then imagine if it had rained and they tried to put the machine outside,

1025
01:35:36,280 --> 01:35:37,840
it would have been even more cramped.

1026
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:38,840
So...

1027
01:35:38,840 --> 01:35:44,840
No, I mean the weather itself was not to a point where it was about to rain.

1028
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:47,880
Besides the way I checked the weather in SVGL beforehand so I didn't know what the hell

1029
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:48,880
was going on.

1030
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:49,880
Right.

1031
01:35:49,880 --> 01:35:53,440
Even though, of course the weather is not really 100% accurate.

1032
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:59,720
But at the same time, but here's another problem with the situation with the freestyle conditions.

1033
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:03,680
You got extreme near the fourth plus machine.

1034
01:36:03,680 --> 01:36:07,200
So you're either going to probably be hearing extreme songs and fourth plus at the same

1035
01:36:07,200 --> 01:36:10,600
time conflicting with your concentration on the routine.

1036
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:13,120
So you might be hearing like, oooh, later to max and...

1037
01:36:13,120 --> 01:36:14,960
They didn't turn one off or anything?

1038
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:22,120
No, for some reason the Xtreme was a little louder than friggin' 4th Plus.

1039
01:36:22,120 --> 01:36:24,380
And we got the 2DX written almost nearby too.

1040
01:36:24,380 --> 01:36:26,240
Was In the Groove involved too, or did they...

1041
01:36:26,240 --> 01:36:30,040
No, no, the In the Groove machine got switched with 4th Plus.

1042
01:36:30,040 --> 01:36:31,040
Gotcha.

1043
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:32,040
Okay, gotcha.

1044
01:36:32,040 --> 01:36:33,040
So you got...

1045
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:39,040
Regardless, I still have not played In The Groove, so I can't really opinionize with these steps on In The Groove.

1046
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:44,040
That would have been interesting though, if that was up and running or whatever.

1047
01:36:44,040 --> 01:36:47,040
I kind of scolded on that one.

1048
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:48,040
Wait, what?

1049
01:36:48,040 --> 01:36:55,040
Like, DCB doesn't really like In The Groove. Not many people like In The Groove because they have complaints with freestyle steps.

1050
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:56,040
Well, yeah.

1051
01:36:56,040 --> 01:37:00,040
But that's controversial. I can't really say anything because I've never tested the thing.

1052
01:37:00,040 --> 01:37:00,540
Right.

1053
01:37:00,540 --> 01:37:02,040
And of course, everything is a matter of opinion.

1054
01:37:02,040 --> 01:37:07,400
I'm kind of surprised nobody took that opportunity, though, to do something with In The Groove.

1055
01:37:07,400 --> 01:37:11,040
Kind of, I don't know, like having to go to the west coast.

1056
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:12,040
I mean, they only have two cabinets.

1057
01:37:12,040 --> 01:37:18,560
They only have two cabinets, and of course, like, you got SVGL, CVGL, RV, not RVGL, well,

1058
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:22,840
sort of the way RVGL, MGL, they're all part of, they're all golfers, so they have to share

1059
01:37:22,840 --> 01:37:24,720
machines with each other in a way.

1060
01:37:24,720 --> 01:37:25,720
Right.

1061
01:37:25,720 --> 01:37:31,240
Especially in the barrier, which is very, of course, you know, like, MGL gave, got the

1062
01:37:31,240 --> 01:37:37,320
pump it up a seat from SVGL, and probably in the groove from SVGL, I'm not really sure

1063
01:37:37,320 --> 01:37:43,320
if that's true or not, or if both places have this in the groove.

1064
01:37:43,320 --> 01:37:44,320
Interesting.

1065
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:50,040
Yeah, let's see, 2DX, oh, did you want to hear about the results?

1066
01:37:50,040 --> 01:37:52,240
Yeah, what happened with the 2DX turning?

1067
01:37:52,240 --> 01:37:57,680
Well, I really didn't really see what's with 2DX, but I've heard that a lot of people complaining

1068
01:37:57,680 --> 01:38:04,680
about the, how 2DX Red was off sync as shit. Yes, it's like, think of it as night style.

1069
01:38:05,640 --> 01:38:06,680
I'm not sure if it's the...

1070
01:38:06,680 --> 01:38:10,680
Not the fucking game is, they gotta get used to it.

1071
01:38:10,680 --> 01:38:17,360
No, I'm not sure if it's the hardware, I'm not sure, cause some people were complaining

1072
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:23,520
with that. I really couldn't complain, either I had the worst accuracy or on 2DX that I

1073
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:28,360
myself and I got a good attack the whole song and this is on a red was it on a

1074
01:38:28,360 --> 01:38:37,040
red red oh wow yes the new red deliver style whoo wow drool get a boner but I'm

1075
01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:40,480
not sure if it's really but since RV jails getting one I'm not sure that's

1076
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:44,280
gonna be if it's the hardware problem that people are saying was a software

1077
01:38:44,280 --> 01:38:49,920
problems itself hmm but hell only time will tell what the what's the truth

1078
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:50,920
If it's off.

1079
01:38:50,920 --> 01:38:51,920
We'll see.

1080
01:38:51,920 --> 01:38:52,920
Alright.

1081
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:56,440
Is there any questions with the SBGL tournament?

1082
01:38:56,440 --> 01:38:57,440
I don't know.

1083
01:38:57,440 --> 01:38:59,360
Nothing I haven't gotten on there and read myself.

1084
01:38:59,360 --> 01:39:02,560
I just kind of feel bad that I wasn't really able to go to the tournament because I really

1085
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:05,400
wanted to go but then at the same time it sounded like it was really crowded as hell

1086
01:39:05,400 --> 01:39:08,520
and not a lot of standing room and if I wasn't entering maybe...

1087
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:13,280
Well, Bill B. Sy, there was some drama involved as well so you don't want to leave.

1088
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:14,280
What's the drama?

1089
01:39:14,280 --> 01:39:16,080
Ooh, tell us about drama.

1090
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:17,480
I'll get to the FUs on that one.

1091
01:39:17,480 --> 01:39:18,480
No, no, no.

1092
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:19,480
I want to know now.

1093
01:39:19,480 --> 01:39:23,640
some people will like it you take up too much time during the FUs anyway let's

1094
01:39:23,640 --> 01:39:27,120
get himself okay let's get out some of it now all right here's like some drama

1095
01:39:27,120 --> 01:39:32,960
with some people like getting pissed up with JSB's behavior which is nothing new

1096
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:40,840
oh yeah JSB throwing a football on DDR bots head oh well how old is DDR bot

1097
01:39:40,840 --> 01:39:46,120
like 11 years old okay I'll pick it up a little so so basically he's resorting to

1098
01:39:46,120 --> 01:39:49,560
to an 11-year-old's immaturity to pick on the 11-year-old. Just curious, all right?

1099
01:39:49,560 --> 01:39:53,560
Yes, well, yeah, you got that. Okay, okay. Birds of a feather.

1100
01:39:53,560 --> 01:39:58,080
Well, of course you got the complaints of the pads, whether or not it's SVGL sport,

1101
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:02,560
or if it's the people being sort of loser. Who started it?

1102
01:40:02,560 --> 01:40:04,520
I can't get involved. All right, all right.

1103
01:40:04,520 --> 01:40:07,680
There's some people drooling over DDR players' girlfriends.

1104
01:40:07,680 --> 01:40:11,880
I have to ask, I have to ask the hard-hitting questions of this program, all right? I want

1105
01:40:11,880 --> 01:40:17,240
know who started the shit who cast the first stone who's the drama starter who

1106
01:40:17,240 --> 01:40:22,040
is their fire flanning the flames I can't really I don't really know exactly

1107
01:40:22,040 --> 01:40:29,360
it has something to do with so Cal and team Seattle which is a long going back

1108
01:40:29,360 --> 01:40:34,320
and forth that's happened for a long long time so that's again not a surprise

1109
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:39,280
all right I'm not sure what happened but they said it was JSB versus some girl in

1110
01:40:39,280 --> 01:40:46,280
Team Seattle. JSB won that one, but for some reason he dropped out of the race. For either

1111
01:40:46,280 --> 01:40:52,480
attraction, or sexually attractive reasons, or...

1112
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:58,200
Was it Tanya? The girl that's always on, because I know she was going, the girl that's... Get

1113
01:40:58,200 --> 01:40:59,680
up, move girl!

1114
01:40:59,680 --> 01:41:01,040
I'm not really sure.

1115
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:04,680
If I remember correctly reading this, because I read this briefly, I think. It was the chick

1116
01:41:04,680 --> 01:41:07,760
that was the one that was on MTV promoting DDR.

1117
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:10,260
I didn't know there was anyone on MTV promoting DDR1.

1118
01:41:10,260 --> 01:41:11,760
What the hell? I don't even know about this.

1119
01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:17,760
Yes, actually, Tanya was on the, um, what is it, the 20 games of the year thing or something?

1120
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:18,760
They did shot stuff.

1121
01:41:18,760 --> 01:41:19,760
Oh yeah, I've heard about that.

1122
01:41:19,760 --> 01:41:21,760
They shot stuff around Seattle. Yeah, okay, so.

1123
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:22,760
I heard about that.

1124
01:41:22,760 --> 01:41:23,760
Alright, so.

1125
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:29,760
Oh yeah, for the winners of PA, one of the first places, of course, Team Seattle.

1126
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:35,260
Second was Fidox, who actually came to the FU tournament and the August.

1127
01:41:35,260 --> 01:41:36,260
Okay, good deal.

1128
01:41:36,260 --> 01:41:37,260
So that was very good.

1129
01:41:37,260 --> 01:41:38,380
uh...

1130
01:41:38,380 --> 01:41:41,140
third-place i don't remember third-place but uh...

1131
01:41:41,140 --> 01:41:45,180
i've got to die back to drama was there any good freestyle drama

1132
01:41:45,180 --> 01:41:46,260
uh...

1133
01:41:46,260 --> 01:41:49,540
well the limited rooms but of course i've told you about the freestyle drama

1134
01:41:49,540 --> 01:41:51,880
but the limited amount of room space

1135
01:41:51,880 --> 01:41:52,740
people get it

1136
01:41:52,740 --> 01:41:54,380
i have to know i have to know

1137
01:41:54,380 --> 01:41:57,140
did anybody get served

1138
01:41:57,140 --> 01:41:58,260
and what way

1139
01:41:58,260 --> 01:41:59,500
he did

1140
01:41:59,500 --> 01:42:03,580
today they do their routine ago you got to do it

1141
01:42:03,580 --> 01:42:05,140
nobody got served

1142
01:42:05,140 --> 01:42:11,180
No, because people were just waiting for freestyle to start. It took too long for everybody else

1143
01:42:11,180 --> 01:42:15,700
to fucking get freestyle prepared. I think it started at 8.30. That was too late. Everybody's

1144
01:42:15,700 --> 01:42:20,260
tired. Oh shit, I could have gone to Spigol if I knew it was going to go that way. But

1145
01:42:20,260 --> 01:42:26,020
at the same time though, I mean, the condition, it was just too hot inside and limited space.

1146
01:42:26,020 --> 01:42:31,340
You can't really do anything. It's like pointing your fingers upwards, just not moving your

1147
01:42:31,340 --> 01:42:34,340
your whole body and using the whole, taking advantage of the whole freestyle.

1148
01:42:34,340 --> 01:42:37,340
Okay, were there any fistfights? No, there were no.

1149
01:42:37,340 --> 01:42:38,340
Stouting matches? Huh?

1150
01:42:38,340 --> 01:42:43,340
Knives drawn? No, no, no. But I heard, yeah, oh yeah.

1151
01:42:43,340 --> 01:42:48,340
Okay, I was just reading the forums, some people saying, damn Fab Five, it does have,

1152
01:42:48,340 --> 01:42:52,340
they have something to do with throwing a football at an 11 year old's head.

1153
01:42:52,340 --> 01:43:00,340
Wait, Fab Five, you mean like Carson and Tom and Gan and all them were there?

1154
01:43:00,340 --> 01:43:05,340
Everybody in the circle is there, but I'm not sure what the hell is going on with this drama and shit.

1155
01:43:05,340 --> 01:43:08,340
But you know, this drama exists, and...

1156
01:43:08,340 --> 01:43:14,340
And people are serving other people, and it's just, you know, servolution.

1157
01:43:14,340 --> 01:43:20,340
Then you got boyfriend-girlfriend conflicts with other men, or other women, whatever the hell you say it.

1158
01:43:20,340 --> 01:43:25,340
Well, this should be interesting, because one of the, I think one of the NorCal people

1159
01:43:25,340 --> 01:43:27,340
was saying, why is this?

1160
01:43:27,340 --> 01:43:30,340
Uh-uh, uh-uh, okay, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh,

1161
01:43:30,340 --> 01:43:33,340
he is not sleeping with my boyfriend, okay?

1162
01:43:33,340 --> 01:43:35,340
Okay, now, uh-uh, it's not gonna happen.

1163
01:43:35,340 --> 01:43:38,340
Okay, I'm gonna serve you right now, okay?

1164
01:43:38,340 --> 01:43:39,340
Well, here's the thing, this is...

1165
01:43:39,340 --> 01:43:40,340
How was that?

1166
01:43:40,340 --> 01:43:41,340
I don't know.

1167
01:43:41,340 --> 01:43:42,340
Well, what's funny is that...

1168
01:43:42,340 --> 01:43:44,340
That was my, like, Texas-slash-ghetto.

1169
01:43:44,340 --> 01:43:46,340
It was my Texas ghetto.

1170
01:43:46,340 --> 01:43:47,340
This is what a...

1171
01:43:47,340 --> 01:43:48,340
I don't understand this drama.

1172
01:43:48,340 --> 01:43:50,340
This is one of the funniest quotes I've ever...

1173
01:43:50,340 --> 01:43:52,340
One of the funniest questions that has been asked to me.

1174
01:43:52,340 --> 01:43:58,660
me why is this hot asian girl going out going out with old joe dirt

1175
01:43:58,660 --> 01:44:01,780

01:44:01,780 --> 01:44:05,140

1186
01:44:34,100 --> 01:44:37,620

1187
01:44:37,620 --> 01:44:39,440

uh...

1191
01:44:43,380 --> 01:44:45,020
well i would be

1192
01:44:45,020 --> 01:44:47,860
like you rob a gay

1193
01:44:47,860 --> 01:44:49,260
I'm not gay, I just...

1194
01:44:49,260 --> 01:44:51,260
Whoa, whoa, whoa! How about you?

1195
01:44:51,260 --> 01:44:52,960
You just pull in on the radio.

1196
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:55,460
Yeah, this is just my radio personality, okay?

1197
01:44:55,460 --> 01:44:58,160
Yeah, pussy! I'm all about the pussy, man.

1198
01:44:58,160 --> 01:45:00,260
Tits, yeah, that's what I want right now.

1199
01:45:00,260 --> 01:45:02,460
A big, big...

1200
01:45:02,460 --> 01:45:03,860
I can't do it.

1201
01:45:03,860 --> 01:45:05,460
I'm...

1202
01:45:05,460 --> 01:45:08,660
I'm better than Judy Garland. I can't hold it anymore.

1203
01:45:08,660 --> 01:45:11,560
Well, perhaps you and that gay guy would have a good match.

1204
01:45:11,560 --> 01:45:15,860
And if he plays DDR, he's probably under 18, so not a good idea.

1205
01:45:15,860 --> 01:45:20,020
uh... he's over eighty by much of the place bdr anything like that

1206
01:45:20,020 --> 01:45:25,380
an actual living breathing a person

1207
01:45:25,380 --> 01:45:28,320
well therefore because i'm gay in this other person's gay

1208
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:31,500
we have to have sex on the top

1209
01:45:31,500 --> 01:45:33,400
did they capture him in net

1210
01:45:33,400 --> 01:45:34,780
you know because

1211
01:45:34,780 --> 01:45:38,140
because if one of the cases right around there you know

1212
01:45:38,140 --> 01:45:39,680
you know what that's the spring

1213
01:45:39,680 --> 01:45:41,140
waited right well he

1214
01:45:41,140 --> 01:45:45,060
it does that they have to think that he was gay

1215
01:45:45,060 --> 01:45:57,580
as he's like bent over some dude. Yeah, I'm gay. Oh man, sorry. Not sorry. Well, I'm glad

Anyways, um, the first one that should be mentioned, well, I guess that'll be the first one.

1279
01:55:55,920 --> 01:56:06,920
Tourney Mix 5+, which is called the Re-Tourney Mix, which, I didn't really read the rules, but it sounds like it's just taking old songs from the Tourney Mix 1 through 5 and redoing them. Big deal.

1280
01:56:06,920 --> 01:56:09,240
Okay, so that's going on right now, you can find all the information you want in front-

1281
01:56:09,240 --> 01:56:11,240
Okay, okay, I have a comment.

1282
01:56:11,240 --> 01:56:18,240
Okay, so it's basically like the flashback episode of your favorite sitcom. It's the same old shit, with a different laugh track.

1283
01:56:18,240 --> 01:56:28,280
Yeah, so there's that. Then there's DDR OSC 3 Plus, the original set file contest. This

1284
01:56:28,280 --> 01:56:34,280
is remixed, basically. The rules for this is it has to be a song, a remix of a song

1285
01:56:34,280 --> 01:56:41,160
that's been used in DDR Attorney Mix, a remix of a song that's been used in OSC, or an Overclocked

1286
01:56:41,160 --> 01:56:46,400
remix that hasn't been used in either one, or an original remix of a song that's in a

1287
01:56:46,400 --> 01:56:52,200
non-music game, you know, base game. So, no DDR remixes, but, you know, remixes of other

1288
01:56:52,200 --> 01:56:57,640
crap is okay. And the due date for this is the 28th. All your information can be found

1289
01:56:57,640 --> 01:57:02,480
on the MyStyle. There's links to the OSC homepage and all that wonderful crap. And,

1290
01:57:02,480 --> 01:57:07,240
um, other than that, still stuff's being worked on for the, you know, the Symphile releases.

1291
01:57:07,240 --> 01:57:11,480
Now, one of the things I thought was funny that I'd like to mention was we've had our

1292
01:57:11,480 --> 01:57:20,780
very first, very first, um, record label coming after a DDR site for music being up on there.

1293
01:57:20,780 --> 01:57:25,920
And it's the funniest record label, you'd never expect it to be on there. It was the

1294
01:57:25,920 --> 01:57:37,660
music from Circus de Soleil. Is that? Cirque de Soleil. Oh, my mistake. Anyways, um, they,

1295
01:57:37,660 --> 01:57:41,220
uh... actually came after my cell for having to get some of the music on their

1296
01:57:41,220 --> 01:57:41,920
site

1297
01:57:41,920 --> 01:57:45,240
which should be surprising because any of their music actually being out there

1298
01:57:45,240 --> 01:57:46,220
on the internet

1299
01:57:46,220 --> 01:57:49,480
why the fuck anyone want to listen to it let them make a remix

1300
01:57:49,480 --> 01:57:53,280
or a uh... not remix a simp file for that i don't know

1301
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:58,020
what i want to know is how the fuck did someone find that

1302
01:57:58,020 --> 01:57:58,580
anyways

1303
01:57:58,580 --> 01:58:01,480
so they got the seasoned assist for that

1304
01:58:01,480 --> 01:58:04,300
uh... thing but everything else is going as planned but i just thought that was

1305
01:58:04,300 --> 01:58:11,980
funny that that would be on there um other than that really nothing else going on so just those

1306
01:58:11,980 --> 01:58:19,340
two little tournaments there that are really don't have that much notice for and um well whatever

1307
01:58:20,860 --> 01:58:26,620
uh a comment in our chat room i'd like some discussion on tournaments is shit discuss

1308
01:58:28,540 --> 01:58:33,580
i just really don't care anymore you know everybody's like i don't even remember

1309
01:58:33,580 --> 01:58:40,580
I don't look at those as a good indicator. There really aren't that many quality sim files out there anymore.

1310
01:58:40,580 --> 01:58:46,580
Here's the problem. The pool is way too diluted, as you just said. I didn't follow any of that shit you just said, basically.

1311
01:58:46,580 --> 01:58:50,580
All I heard was blah, blah, blah, another contest on blah, blah, blah, another site. With blah, blah, blah.

1312
01:58:50,580 --> 01:58:54,580
And what the fuck? It's a contest based off of other contests? That's kind of weird to me, sorry.

1313
01:58:54,580 --> 01:59:01,580
But, so basically you've got what? You've got tournaments, and then you have the EI tournament, and then you have this, and then that.

1314
01:59:01,580 --> 01:59:05,340
everybody's got a freaking tournament going on right now it's just like how

1315
01:59:05,340 --> 01:59:09,620
like two years ago when extreme was kind of new every other week there was a DDR

1316
01:59:09,620 --> 01:59:13,180
tournament somewhere like I remember in NorCal every week for a couple months

1317
01:59:13,180 --> 01:59:16,420
there was a tournament somewhere and it was just like people did not have the

1318
01:59:16,420 --> 01:59:21,340
time to come up with freestyle routines they didn't care anymore so I see the

1319
01:59:21,340 --> 01:59:24,540
same thing happening here here's my problem okay and this is the biggest

1320
01:59:24,540 --> 01:59:29,040
problem that I have with everything once food mix came out that set the new

1321
01:59:29,040 --> 01:59:35,040
I'm sorry. It's just nothing has come close. Nothing will come close until Food Mix releases something else.

1322
01:59:35,040 --> 01:59:36,040
Oh yeah, Food Mix.

1323
01:59:36,040 --> 01:59:44,040
And that's it. So, you know what? I'm sorry, but there's no, no Simphile creator out there that can even match that, or even come close to matching that.

1324
01:59:44,040 --> 01:59:52,040
Even without the yippie hippie background movies. If you were to take the background movies out, would you still feel the same?

1325
01:59:52,040 --> 01:59:56,600
the same. Because I think background movies is a little much to ask some Joe Shmo in their

1326
01:59:56,600 --> 02:00:00,800
basement to create. How the hell the food mix guys did it? Hey, you know what? I don't

1327
02:00:00,800 --> 02:00:03,440
know. They just had way too much free time. But come on.

1328
02:00:03,440 --> 02:00:06,400
You're very talented though. I mean, that's what it really was.

1329
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:10,320
Don't get me wrong. And I, the songs are great and the steps are great. I'm not arguing that.

1330
02:00:10,320 --> 02:00:11,320
Well, that's a pretty good question.

1331
02:00:11,320 --> 02:00:16,080
I'm just saying, they've got a really, they've got it all. So, even if you were to remove

1332
02:00:16,080 --> 02:00:18,160
the videos, would you still say that?

1333
02:00:18,160 --> 02:00:19,160
Yeah.

1334
02:00:19,160 --> 02:00:24,160
So, the artwork in the background is still phenomenal, and they created their own songs that didn't sound like shit.

1335
02:00:24,160 --> 02:00:30,160
That was also really good. And the interface, the whole theme was awesome. Just everything about that was awesome.

1336
02:00:30,160 --> 02:00:33,160
Now, as I see in the chat room, you know, how about the judging?

1337
02:00:33,160 --> 02:00:39,160
Well, I've been saying it since, what, Turnimix 2-3-1, I don't know, it doesn't matter.

1338
02:00:39,160 --> 02:00:46,160
I've been saying they cannot have these sim files labeled by who made them, because you'll never get fair judging for it.

1339
02:00:46,160 --> 02:00:48,920
What do they do every time they fucking label who they're from?

1340
02:00:48,920 --> 02:00:51,920
Then they're not voting on Simphile, they're voting for who their favorite person is.

1341
02:00:51,920 --> 02:00:58,280
And everybody goes straight to download D.M. Ashura's file, and they go straight to download

1342
02:00:58,280 --> 02:00:59,280
Moogle Hunter's file.

1343
02:00:59,280 --> 02:01:02,200
And don't get me wrong, I love Moogle Hunter, he's a local guy, I love him.

1344
02:01:02,200 --> 02:01:03,200
And what else?

1345
02:01:03,200 --> 02:01:08,280
They go straight to download Bahmani Ruler, Jesus Christ, and they go straight to download

1346
02:01:08,280 --> 02:01:11,560
whatever, the big people in the Sim scenes.

1347
02:01:11,560 --> 02:01:12,560
And they win!

1348
02:01:12,560 --> 02:01:17,560
Actually, you can't say that about Boogle Hunter from X4, because he got screwed over and, you know...

1349
02:01:17,560 --> 02:01:22,560
Well, you actually can't say that because they started doing the pack thing, which is just a more wasted bandwidth on the internet.

1350
02:01:22,560 --> 02:01:31,560
It doesn't matter anymore. No one seems to care. I mean, there are, I guess, people... I don't know. I just really... I don't know. It doesn't matter to me anymore.

1351
02:01:31,560 --> 02:01:37,560
I used to go to those and go, oh, there's some good sim files there, but now it's just like, no, they're not. No, no, no.

1352
02:01:37,560 --> 02:01:38,560
No, I'm sorry.

1353
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:46,560
It gets gone to shit, basically. People will just not care, and they just go, let's download a song, and let's get a high score of it.

1354
02:01:46,560 --> 02:01:56,560
Okay, I download personally, I go on, you know, by myself almost daily, and I look on there in their sim files, you know, selection area, and I look and see what remixes are on there.

1355
02:01:56,560 --> 02:02:00,560
And I listen to every single Max remix on there, every single one that's been made.

1356
02:02:00,560 --> 02:02:01,560
Yeah!

1357
02:02:01,560 --> 02:02:06,560
Okay, I know that's wrong, but I do it, you know, because you know what, there are every-

1358
02:02:06,560 --> 02:02:18,560
Next person to take a Max song and mix it with a Pops A or Pops B song like Max, I don't know, Max, Mr. Wonderful or whatever?

1359
02:02:18,560 --> 02:02:24,560
I hope you get laughed off the internet, seriously. Mr. Maxifull or whatever, I hope you get laughed off the internet.

1360
02:02:24,560 --> 02:02:29,560
Well, someone did make- I think someone did do It's Renny Max, I'm not really sure that's true.

1361
02:02:29,560 --> 02:02:31,560
Kill me!

1362
02:02:59,560 --> 02:03:04,560
Actually, I wouldn't say but constructive comments because, you know, people post things,

1363
02:03:04,560 --> 02:03:07,560
Ooh, you stole this! You stole that!

1364
02:03:07,560 --> 02:03:11,560
Crap, and then it gets deleted afterwards by a mod.

1365
02:03:11,560 --> 02:03:14,560
Anyways, whatever.

1366
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:18,560
So basically, yeah, there's just not a lot of good shit out there anymore.

1367
02:03:18,560 --> 02:03:24,560
I'm sorry, food mix and diverse systems have basically cornered the market in sim files and remixes, so...

1368
02:03:24,560 --> 02:03:26,560
Sorry.

1369
02:03:26,560 --> 02:03:31,640
All right, and that's all that's going on in the sims team right now, it's just a variety

1370
02:03:31,640 --> 02:03:32,640
of tournaments.

1371
02:03:32,640 --> 02:03:33,640
You know what?

1372
02:03:33,640 --> 02:03:34,640
Here's an idea.

1373
02:03:34,640 --> 02:03:37,600
If you want to make your tournament stand out above all the other remix tournaments,

1374
02:03:37,600 --> 02:03:40,000
how about throwing some decent prizes?

1375
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,160
Get some entry fees and some real good prizes.

1376
02:03:42,160 --> 02:03:46,340
Get some folks to donate some good stuff, because really, what's the best prize you've

1377
02:03:46,340 --> 02:03:48,840
ever seen for one of these tournaments?

1378
02:03:48,840 --> 02:03:49,840
Nothing.

1379
02:03:49,840 --> 02:03:51,840
Just the prizes.

1380
02:03:51,840 --> 02:03:52,840
Case in point.

1381
02:03:52,840 --> 02:03:53,840
Thank you very much.

1382
02:03:53,840 --> 02:03:57,760
a really really good freestyle routines when there's a thousand dollar pot on the line

1383
02:03:57,760 --> 02:04:01,780
when you see the really shit for routines you know when it's going to be a pat on the

1384
02:04:01,780 --> 02:04:09,000
back and a certificate you know good job you the winner you winner of tourney mint just

1385
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:15,700
just one little quick note here i like to mention um goldwave is not a remixing program

1386
02:04:15,700 --> 02:04:21,360
do not use it as a remixing program it is not meant for remixing it's meant for audio

1387
02:04:21,360 --> 02:04:27,680
editing audio editing does not include remixing please do not use it to remix stuff speeding up a

1388
02:04:27,680 --> 02:04:32,480
song or putting a filter over it does not constitute a remix please do not make it a remix please do

1389
02:04:32,480 --> 02:04:38,160
not reverse a song call it a remix it's not a remix stop people please stop

1390
02:04:41,680 --> 02:04:48,320
all right on that note i think we're gonna go to a break um let's see oh yes loki and chopping up

1391
02:04:48,320 --> 02:04:55,560
a song very crudely and in, I might add, Gold Wave, is also not a remix.

1392
02:04:55,560 --> 02:05:01,760
Okay, fair enough. I think what we're going to do is we're going to go to a break, and

1393
02:05:01,760 --> 02:05:04,880
why don't we do, because we haven't played any of this in a while, why don't we do some

1394
02:05:04,880 --> 02:05:07,200
music from Phoon Mix? Sound good?

1395
02:05:07,200 --> 02:05:08,200
Yes.

1396
02:05:08,200 --> 02:05:09,200
Sounds phony.

1397
02:05:09,200 --> 02:05:13,000
Sounds Phoon-erific. Alright, we'll play some Phoon Mix music, and then we come back the

1398
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:18,200
FUs of the week, because what a good way to follow up with some Phoon Mix music. Alright,

1399
02:05:18,200 --> 02:05:23,760
we'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio. Enjoy.

1400
02:05:48,200 --> 02:05:53,200
Feel the touch of my hand

1401
02:06:10,200 --> 02:06:12,200
He's the brute of your head

1402
02:06:12,200 --> 02:06:14,200
Hittin' time in battle at the end

1403
02:06:14,200 --> 02:06:21,200
Hit the coast.

1404
02:06:44,200 --> 02:06:51,200
Feel you.

1405
02:12:14,200 --> 02:12:20,200
people to bust out a Sharpie pen, draw arrows on the tiles, and start stomping away.

1406
02:12:20,200 --> 02:12:25,200
A friendly public service announcement from Orange Lounge Radio.

1407
02:12:25,200 --> 02:12:30,200
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio. We're going to try to do a list list in a little

1408
02:12:30,200 --> 02:12:35,200
while, and I think the topic tonight, so you guys can start thinking about it. Don't, well,

1409
02:12:35,200 --> 02:12:41,200
should I hold off on it? Yeah. Alright, well hold off on it. Some of you guys that were

1410
02:12:41,200 --> 02:12:44,640
chat earlier tonight they'll already know what the list list is all about for

1411
02:12:44,640 --> 02:12:48,640
tonight so you know start thinking about that because I am going to do the one

1412
02:12:48,640 --> 02:12:51,000
that you guys were talking about beforehand I said that would be a good

1413
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:57,440
list list topic we'll do that but first we have to get ranty yes because it just

1414
02:12:57,440 --> 02:13:00,440
would not be an episode of orange launch radio if we did not have a little bit

1415
02:13:00,440 --> 02:13:06,000
when the hell is that noise you need to talk about what that's all about Loki

1416
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
p0k3smot42o1 that's one gaussian meter

1417
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:43,560
the TV on. Awesome. Yeah, it's a cancer meter. That's basically what it is. And it's also

1418
02:13:43,560 --> 02:13:47,440
for ghost hunting. Yeah, I like how you just added that in here. Oh, and it's also for

1419
02:13:47,440 --> 02:13:58,640
ghost hunting. Alright. Like the thing from Ghostbusters. The PKE meter. Shall we get

1420
02:13:58,640 --> 02:14:02,900
to tonight's FUs of the Week? Sure. Alright, you guys can send in your FUs in the chat

1421
02:14:02,900 --> 02:14:07,820
room right now, try to keep them brief please. However, why is it that we have to do the

1422
02:14:07,820 --> 02:14:10,740
FUs every single week, Ms. Darkseidro?

1423
02:14:10,740 --> 02:14:11,740
Buh-arg.

1424
02:14:11,740 --> 02:14:32,740
My first FU goes to a people who decide to weave in and out of lanes in the fog.

1425
02:14:32,740 --> 02:14:35,740
That's really stupid and that's how accidents happen.

1426
02:14:35,740 --> 02:14:39,740
But then again, I suppose the Darwinism will soon work on that one.

1427
02:14:39,740 --> 02:14:42,740
Another one goes to people who drive too slow in the fog,

1428
02:14:42,740 --> 02:14:45,740
because then all the rest of us are backed up by the people who are speeding

1429
02:14:45,740 --> 02:14:47,740
running into my ass.

1430
02:14:47,740 --> 02:14:52,740
And of course, driving off without stopping or anything, so.

1431
02:14:52,740 --> 02:14:57,740
A few goes to the top of my trunk inside,

1432
02:14:57,740 --> 02:15:01,740
because I gouged out a big piece of my thumb just shy of the tendon.

1433
02:15:01,740 --> 02:15:07,380
It bled, and bled, and bled, and I got one of those Band-Aids on it that's supposed

1434
02:15:07,380 --> 02:15:13,780
to trap the fluids underneath so that you'll heal faster using your own antibodies, and

1435
02:15:13,780 --> 02:15:15,540
it looked like a big purple bubble.

1436
02:15:15,540 --> 02:15:18,340
It's really disgusting.

1437
02:15:18,340 --> 02:15:26,420
And F you toward the financial situation to where I can't afford to get the special edition

1438
02:15:26,420 --> 02:15:31,980
2DS tape style, but I have Parappa coming, so it's all good.

1439
02:15:31,980 --> 02:15:38,220
And as you toured how expensive Dan's present was, since he doesn't listen to the show,

1440
02:15:38,220 --> 02:15:44,460
I have no problem saying that I bought Dan the Ultimate Matrix box set, and it was 70

1441
02:15:44,460 --> 02:15:45,460
bucks.

1442
02:15:45,460 --> 02:15:49,300
Although, actually, I think that they marked it down by $10 a Target.

1443
02:15:49,300 --> 02:15:51,420
I paid $59, so 10 different.

1444
02:15:51,420 --> 02:15:54,260
No, $57, yeah, it was about that at Target.

1445
02:15:54,260 --> 02:15:55,260
They lowered the price.

1446
02:15:55,260 --> 02:15:59,820
But still, when I first looked at it and saw a $70 price tag, I was freaking out, but I

1447
02:15:59,820 --> 02:16:04,700
bought it for him anyway.

1448
02:16:04,700 --> 02:16:11,180
Another F.U. goes toward just the sick that I had for the past three days.

1449
02:16:11,180 --> 02:16:16,380
It was the type of illness that just saps all of your energy, and I did nothing but

1450
02:16:16,380 --> 02:16:21,900
eat lobster burritos and ice cream for three days, sat on the floor and played Fantasy

1451
02:16:21,900 --> 02:16:28,900
kostjamrh The only thing I can remember is the stupid bitch that tried to pass me in the right lane today.

1452
02:16:51,900 --> 02:17:18,900
kostjamrh And the slow driver has behind on the way to my dad's house today, because he's driving down a one lane road, fucking slow because there's a little fog in the distance, and he can only see 999 miles, and not the full 1000.

1453
02:17:48,900 --> 02:17:58,900
p0k3smot42o I don't like potlucks

1454
02:18:18,900 --> 02:18:23,900
p0k3smot42o i dont call you an addict

1455
02:18:27,900 --> 02:18:32,900
p0k3smot42o i dont have much to complain about

1456
02:18:38,900 --> 02:18:43,900
p0k3smot42o i dont have much to complain about

1457
02:18:43,900 --> 02:18:51,240
for five years I'm not getting paid shit so that sucks and then I don't know I

1458
02:18:51,240 --> 02:18:56,740
just hate Christmas fuck you to Christmas because you know I don't want

1459
02:18:56,740 --> 02:19:01,200
to buy people gifts see you're a Grinch I buy people gifts all year round and I

1460
02:19:01,200 --> 02:19:04,720
don't really get shit about the birthday of Jesus or whatever it is supposed to

1461
02:19:04,720 --> 02:19:13,420
be for you know I'm sure immaculate conception okay that's what I got to say

1462
02:19:13,420 --> 02:19:17,740
she Mary was a fucking whore okay she just does not want to admit it they're

1463
02:19:17,740 --> 02:19:23,840
not putting it in the books okay but you know that she had a way she had a way

1464
02:19:23,840 --> 02:19:30,160
around the Bethlehem there little slut anyway well now that we're all going to

1465
02:19:30,160 --> 02:19:35,020
hell anything else you want to share yeah if I give a printer for the bean

1466
02:19:35,020 --> 02:19:38,400
out of ink and I have to buy more ink because the fucking cartridges are like

1467
02:19:38,400 --> 02:19:44,400
tiny. You print like one page and it's like, out of ink! You're out of ink! Ah, shit. I

1468
02:19:44,400 --> 02:19:48,400
might as well buy a new printer, because it comes with new ink when you buy a new printer,

1469
02:19:48,400 --> 02:19:54,400
and it's just about as expensive as replacing the ink, so, why not? There, I'm done.

1470
02:20:00,400 --> 02:20:06,400
A nephew to the fog, because fog is scary, and I don't like driving in it, and I think people are always

1471
02:20:06,400 --> 02:20:11,580
always going to run into me, and it's scary. An F.U. to the fact that the bar sucked last

1472
02:20:11,580 --> 02:20:15,120
night, I did not have really a lot of fun. Well, you know, I had fun with the person

1473
02:20:15,120 --> 02:20:20,920
that I went with, but I just wasn't feeling it. So, F.U. to bars in general. I think I'm

1474
02:20:20,920 --> 02:20:28,200
going to stop going. Except for karaoke, because I love karaoke. And I don't really have a

1475
02:20:28,200 --> 02:20:32,580
whole lot else. An F.U. to not really getting any sleep in the past few days, and the fact

1476
02:20:32,580 --> 02:20:36,480
I'm not going to get any more in the next few because I've got a lot of stuff going

1477
02:20:36,480 --> 02:20:45,480
on at work next week and I just want to cry. That's it for me. Let's go on to DDR Angel.

1478
02:20:45,480 --> 02:20:52,480
Heh, as I try not to strangle Rob with the, uh, mic cord! Yay! Um...

1479
02:20:52,480 --> 02:20:53,480
I actually have no idea.

1480
02:20:53,480 --> 02:20:58,480
God, I don't even know. Well, yeah, just F you to circumstances, cause...

1481
02:20:58,480 --> 02:21:03,480
Um, well, not for me personally, but for other people that I...

1482
02:21:03,480 --> 02:21:04,480
You're a F you!

1483
02:21:04,480 --> 02:21:11,480
Yeah, I know! But, uh, I don't like said person either, so never mind.

1484
02:21:11,480 --> 02:21:23,480
And yeah, nothing else because it's Christmas week and I'm not as anxious as I was last week so, too bad.

1485
02:21:25,480 --> 02:21:29,480
Alright, Arkadian42, what's on your mind?

1486
02:21:31,480 --> 02:21:38,480
Uh, let's see, uh, fuck you to feeling kinda blah at the moment. I don't know, I just feel tired tonight.

1487
02:21:38,480 --> 02:21:39,480
You're getting it.

1488
02:21:39,480 --> 02:21:40,480
Am I getting it?

1489
02:21:40,480 --> 02:21:41,480
Well, I don't know if I'm getting anything, but I just had some colds and stuff.

1490
02:21:41,480 --> 02:21:42,480
Maybe I've just been sleeping.

1491
02:21:42,480 --> 02:21:43,480
Okay, uh, I don't know.

1492
02:21:43,480 --> 02:21:44,480
I don't know.

1493
02:21:44,480 --> 02:21:45,480
It's not really too much.

1494
02:21:45,480 --> 02:21:50,480
I'll give a preliminary fuck you to the Sacramento Quark, because they're probably going to make

1495
02:21:50,480 --> 02:21:51,480
me pay the full damn fine.

1496
02:21:51,480 --> 02:21:52,480
But I hope they'll reduce it more easily.

1497
02:21:52,480 --> 02:21:53,480
That was the goodness of everybody.

1498
02:21:53,480 --> 02:21:54,480
I don't know.

1499
02:21:54,480 --> 02:21:55,480
I don't know.

1500
02:21:55,480 --> 02:21:56,480
I don't know.

1501
02:21:56,480 --> 02:21:57,480
I don't know.

1502
02:21:57,480 --> 02:21:58,480
I don't know.

1503
02:21:58,480 --> 02:21:59,480
I don't know.

1504
02:21:59,480 --> 02:22:00,480
I don't know.

1505
02:22:00,480 --> 02:22:04,440
to the sacramento court because they're probably going to make me pay the full damn fine

1506
02:22:04,440 --> 02:22:07,840
but I hope they'll reduce it more easily

1507
02:22:07,840 --> 02:22:09,920
out of the goodness of their hearts

1508
02:22:09,920 --> 02:22:16,920
they have no hearts!

1509
02:22:18,280 --> 02:22:20,640
explicit

1510
02:22:20,640 --> 02:22:22,160
alright

1511
02:22:22,160 --> 02:22:27,740
I've already said most of my FUs from the SPGL tournament

1512
02:22:27,740 --> 02:22:30,320
okay an FU goes to the fog

1513
02:22:30,320 --> 02:22:33,720
God damn, I couldn't even see what the hell I was driving.

1514
02:22:33,720 --> 02:22:40,220
Oh my god, thank god I didn't go to SVGL because I would have cried like a little girl in the fog because I hate fog.

1515
02:22:40,220 --> 02:22:42,320
I really, really hate fog.

1516
02:22:42,320 --> 02:22:49,320
Fe to my friend Patrick for giving me the wrong directions. We almost got lost a few times heading back...

1517
02:22:49,320 --> 02:22:53,320
No, heading to SVGL and heading back again to Sacramento.

1518
02:22:53,320 --> 02:22:54,620
God.

1519
02:22:54,620 --> 02:22:59,620
Either that or just giving Fe to Yahoo maps for messing up the directions.

1520
02:22:59,620 --> 02:23:05,040
FV2MyFriend for misplanning the time management just heading to SVGL, we were supposed to

1521
02:23:05,040 --> 02:23:11,200
be there like around 11.15 as planned, but I had planned earlier, but he wanted me to

1522
02:23:11,200 --> 02:23:16,920
do certain things, therefore causing us to be there around like 11.35 almost being late

1523
02:23:16,920 --> 02:23:20,240
to the whole tournament.

1524
02:23:20,240 --> 02:23:27,040
And I hate to say this, but FV2MyFriend Sean, not Shane, for being to SVGL very late, instead

1525
02:23:27,040 --> 02:23:44,040
He said he went to Milpitas Golf Land, playing in the groove for 30 minutes, when you know there's a big tournament that a friend of ours who was actually at his car, who Hella wanted to compete in his first big tournament and try to shine at his first tournament.

1526
02:23:44,040 --> 02:23:46,040
Yeah, we have an actual...

1527
02:23:46,040 --> 02:23:50,040
You know that's kind of smart to go play in the groove at Milpitas because you know everybody's a Sunnyvale?

1528
02:23:50,040 --> 02:23:56,040
You know Hella is not a word?

1529
02:23:56,040 --> 02:24:02,040
I just needed to point out that somehow or another I managed to spend $111.11 at the grocery store today.

1530
02:24:02,040 --> 02:24:07,040
Thank you for that bit of utter randomness. Back to explicit.

1531
02:24:07,040 --> 02:24:15,040
Okay, an F.U. goes to having four freaking finals the whole week, not getting me enough sleep.

1532
02:24:15,040 --> 02:24:22,040
Damn, finals sucks, but at least it's over with and at least I passed all my fucking classes. Thank God for that.

1533
02:24:22,040 --> 02:24:30,040
And Fv2 people who actually spent $23,000 on a fucking Yu-Gi-Oh card.

1534
02:24:30,040 --> 02:24:38,040
Yes. That is ridiculously stupid. Spending $23,000 on a freaking card.

1535
02:24:38,040 --> 02:24:42,040
When it's going to be released later on as an actual comment.

1536
02:24:42,040 --> 02:24:46,040
Everyone knows that, you know, Pokemon's where it's at.

1537
02:24:46,040 --> 02:24:50,360
yeah three oh yeah how much what I remember I forgot how much spending a

1538
02:24:50,360 --> 02:24:55,360
shitload of money just for three Pikachu's on Pokemon I don't remember but

1539
02:24:55,360 --> 02:24:59,040
I don't give a shit but you could have spent like a Honda Civic or any other

1540
02:24:59,040 --> 02:25:05,240
freaking car rather than spending money on a freaking card who would spend that

1541
02:25:05,240 --> 02:25:10,280
much money a card collector with flots of liquid assets to throw away at any

1542
02:25:10,280 --> 02:25:15,720
whim the person who burns money in his fireplace the person who wipes his ass

1543
02:25:15,720 --> 02:25:22,720
with dollar bills. A person who uses napkins, or actually dollar bills with napkins. Wow.

1544
02:25:25,720 --> 02:25:32,720
A person who eats money. Oh man. Okay, an F-Fute goes to the scar I have on my leg during

1545
02:25:35,720 --> 02:25:42,720
the SVGL3 tournament. I was, I was nonstop bleeding the whole time. Wow, really, and

1546
02:25:42,720 --> 02:25:49,440
really and you didn't die? I didn't die, so I'm still alive. Not poison and stuff and

1547
02:25:49,440 --> 02:25:54,760
all. And F.U. goes to the rest of the drama on SVGL3, of course. Yes, I screwed up on

1548
02:25:54,760 --> 02:26:01,040
the fucking tournament regardless of the patty issues or not. And F.U. goes to AMP, the drink

1549
02:26:01,040 --> 02:26:05,160
AMP, for not keeping me awake the whole time. It says it's supposed to keep me awake just

1550
02:26:05,160 --> 02:26:11,360
like balls does. Well, those assholes were lying to you. I'm sorry there's no substitute

1551
02:26:11,360 --> 02:26:16,160
for balls some good balls down your throat it's just perfect yeah cuz those

1552
02:26:16,160 --> 02:26:20,720
that amp is better well I nearly fell asleep in the wheel and almost got into

1553
02:26:20,720 --> 02:26:28,440
an accident god damn that stimulant for not keeping me away yeah that's how bad

1554
02:26:28,440 --> 02:26:34,400
a freaking amp is oh yeah um the amp 2dx led for being hella either the

1555
02:26:34,400 --> 02:26:39,480
sounds being hella off-sync or just me being off-sync as shit scoring like

1556
02:26:39,480 --> 02:26:44,480
90% goods is not cool, especially for songs that you nearly...

1557
02:26:44,480 --> 02:26:46,480
That's cool for me.

1558
02:26:46,480 --> 02:26:52,480
That's like playing D2R with a full grade attack, which I've nearly done.

1559
02:26:53,480 --> 02:26:55,480
And finally...

1560
02:26:55,480 --> 02:26:57,480
And... Oh no, I'm...

1561
02:26:57,480 --> 02:26:59,480
Wrap it up!

1562
02:26:59,480 --> 02:27:02,480
Oh yeah, of course, FU4 not sleeping, of course.

1563
02:27:02,480 --> 02:27:06,480
FU4 actually cleaning up for fucking Christmas.

1564
02:27:06,480 --> 02:27:09,820
Christmas. I know Christmas is in the house and that's why I'm taking it this week, but

1565
02:27:09,820 --> 02:27:15,240
I shouldn't have been cleaning up the whole week that I had finals for god damn sakes.

1566
02:27:15,240 --> 02:27:18,980
I swear to god you're going to have your own spin-off show where you just sit there. You

1567
02:27:18,980 --> 02:27:22,860
and Dark Child. I'm going to give you guys your own show. It's going to be on at three

1568
02:27:22,860 --> 02:27:29,860
in the morning. So you can get this all out of your system. Now wrap it up.

1569
02:27:29,860 --> 02:27:38,820
stop. Fine. That has to be continued. No, no, never to be continued. Over. Are you in

1570
02:27:38,820 --> 02:27:44,380
the booth or something? What is this sound effect? Why hasn't he tried out for life in

1571
02:27:44,380 --> 02:27:52,460
the real world? I hate my roommates because they annoy me so. Let me count the ways. Damn

1572
02:27:52,460 --> 02:27:59,660
those cameras. Let's fucking break the cameras and blow up the house. Yeah, like I said,

1573
02:27:59,660 --> 02:28:05,620
to be continued. There's no ending of the F.U. raps.

1574
02:28:05,620 --> 02:28:10,620
Chat room time. Misty says F.U. to the cam for being retarded when the presents were

1575
02:28:10,620 --> 02:28:14,280
up. F.U. to the guy that won't answer my text messages. I know that you're pissed at the

1576
02:28:14,280 --> 02:28:17,780
rest of the people that work at the same store, but are you so pissed that you can't even

1577
02:28:17,780 --> 02:28:21,960
answer a text message to let me know you're alright? Damn it, I'm getting worried about

1578
02:28:21,960 --> 02:28:25,980
you. Don't want to break our friendship over something stupid, but if I have to, I will.

1579
02:28:25,980 --> 02:28:34,480
out. Thank you sir. Who needs food? DJ Ron Ma S says, you know what you sound like right

1580
02:28:34,480 --> 02:28:42,980
now is you sound like our old microphone. This is Matt coming to you from two years ago.

1581
02:28:42,980 --> 02:28:49,380
Oh yeah. DJ Ron Ma S says, F you to the idiots on my job for stealing broken iPods. Are you

1582
02:28:49,380 --> 02:28:55,280
that fucking stupid? Another F you to the RIAA MPAA for taking down supernova.org. Groton

1583
02:28:55,280 --> 02:28:56,280
hell, you bastards!

1584
02:28:56,280 --> 02:28:57,280
No, it's bunny-

1585
02:28:57,280 --> 02:29:00,720
Hey! If you actually go to supernova.org and check out the site, it says that they shut

1586
02:29:00,720 --> 02:29:08,240
down due to bandwidth issues, not because of the RIA or MPAA. However, buy-torrent.com.

1587
02:29:08,240 --> 02:29:14,240
That's not B-U-I, but B-I, like bisexual. B-I-torrent.com. And thank me later.

1588
02:29:14,240 --> 02:29:21,600
And all I have to say is, there's something else probably gonna come out that's gonna

1589
02:29:21,600 --> 02:29:22,600
replace BitTorrent anyways.

1590
02:29:22,600 --> 02:29:28,320
I'm coming out of the booth! I'm just using a tonant reactor right now.

1591
02:29:28,320 --> 02:29:35,160
Alright, back to the FUs. And an FU, continuing DTRMS, and an FU to the customer that tried

1592
02:29:35,160 --> 02:29:42,160
to kick my ass for buying the very last mini PS2 in my store. SUCK ON A COLD!

1593
02:29:42,160 --> 02:29:47,160
Stop buying smaller products! God damn it, Sony's trying to do to you what they did,

1594
02:29:47,160 --> 02:29:56,160
Or what Nintendo did with the Game Boy, is release the same shit smaller and with less functionality or whatever.

1595
02:29:56,160 --> 02:30:00,160
That's all a word. I know it. I don't care. I really don't.

1596
02:30:00,160 --> 02:30:05,160
I'm gonna shove that tube up your ass that you're using for the sound effects.

1597
02:30:05,160 --> 02:30:09,160
I'm old school, man.

1598
02:30:09,160 --> 02:30:17,160
Sherlock has an F.U. An F.U. to the Syracuse DDR scene for being a bunch of hypocritical shit talkers.

1599
02:30:17,160 --> 02:30:21,160
You're the reason why I hate going to the local arcades.

1600
02:30:21,160 --> 02:30:29,160
And Jazz says F.U. to Fog. I had to drive via road reflectors last night.

1601
02:30:29,160 --> 02:30:37,160
Dark Sakura sends a message and says I want to offer a fuck you to that sky guy. He really pisses me off. Seriously.

1602
02:30:37,160 --> 02:30:42,160
Screw you, hippie.

1603
02:30:42,160 --> 02:30:49,160
Jaded2004 says, F you to my windows for making it cold in here, because it's 12 degrees outside.

1604
02:30:49,160 --> 02:30:51,160
Oh my god, it's time to move to the Bahamas. Seriously?

1605
02:30:51,160 --> 02:30:53,160
Oh, see ya.

1606
02:30:53,160 --> 02:30:57,160
Sorry.

1607
02:30:57,160 --> 02:30:59,160
Can I see that tube for a minute?

1608
02:30:59,160 --> 02:31:00,160
No.

1609
02:31:00,160 --> 02:31:02,160
No, I want to do the sound effect. No, I want to do the sound effect.

1610
02:31:02,160 --> 02:31:05,160
Come on, let me do the sound effect.

1611
02:31:05,160 --> 02:31:07,160
This is God talking.

1612
02:31:07,160 --> 02:31:10,160
Loki, you need to be punished.

1613
02:31:14,160 --> 02:31:17,160
There's rock germs on it now.

1614
02:31:17,160 --> 02:31:19,160
I frenched it.

1615
02:31:19,160 --> 02:31:23,160
Um, Rychan says F you to the manic depressants that seem to find me,

1616
02:31:23,160 --> 02:31:25,160
and being the person I am,

1617
02:31:25,160 --> 02:31:27,160
listening to their whining and act like their friends.

1618
02:31:27,160 --> 02:31:31,160
F you to my awesome week coming to an end on my birthday.

1619
02:31:31,160 --> 02:31:33,160
F you to myself for crying so much.

1620
02:31:33,160 --> 02:31:41,260
Right-chan needs an orange lounge hug and F you to my ignition pads finally

1621
02:31:41,260 --> 02:31:46,020
biting the dust I loved you guys nine months of accomplishments cry face

1622
02:31:46,020 --> 02:31:50,940
illusion says F you to this crazy lady that was honking at us and flipping us

1623
02:31:50,940 --> 02:31:55,740
off as we headed home from Knott's Berry Farm last night okay hold on I have two

1624
02:31:55,740 --> 02:32:01,180
issues with that a when you're in so Cal that's the way everybody drives down

1625
02:32:01,180 --> 02:32:05,600
there. You're all fucking nuts. And B, what the hell are you doing at Knott's Berry Farm?

1626
02:32:05,600 --> 02:32:09,280
Dude, that place rocks. You can make your own candles.

1627
02:32:09,280 --> 02:32:15,000
Knott's Berry Farm. I don't know about now, but I don't know about you, man, the laughing

1628
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:18,560
stock of theme parks. I don't know about you, but how come they have a theme park based

1629
02:32:18,560 --> 02:32:28,560
around jelly? I mean, really. Jellyland. With Snoopy and his jelly bandits. It's like an

1630
02:32:28,560 --> 02:32:33,580
overrated like I don't even know what all right illusion continues f you to

1631
02:32:33,580 --> 02:32:38,700
myself for being too greedy to want to pay my own hard-earned money on other

1632
02:32:38,700 --> 02:32:50,380
people and emphasis on hard and f you to televangelism and lastly Poto says f you

1633
02:32:50,380 --> 02:32:55,200
to imbalanced paladins in the world of Warcraft I'm tired of killing the thing

1634
02:32:55,200 --> 02:33:01,740
three times. Well, don't play World of Warcraft. And another F.U. to Loki for that Virgin Mary

1635
02:33:01,740 --> 02:33:08,740
comment. Just kidding. But do F.U. to not say, and I quote, J.K., but do F.U. to not

1636
02:33:10,540 --> 02:33:17,540
saying Merry Christmas, everyone. Christmas? Get it? No, no, no. Get it? Christmas? I don't

1637
02:33:47,540 --> 02:33:52,940
to do it, right? Sure, why not? Loki, you're going to do it. Yes. And I'm going to do it.

1638
02:33:52,940 --> 02:34:00,020
Angel, are you going to do it? And why don't you two share? The couch gets to share. You

1639
02:34:00,020 --> 02:34:04,580
know what? No. I changed my mind. Arcadian gets to do it by himself. Jonas, you don't

1640
02:34:04,580 --> 02:34:09,580
get to do it because you were late. But if you want to do it late, or if you want to

1641
02:34:09,580 --> 02:34:14,700
do it... Jonas is late. Is he pregnant? If you want to help Arcadian, you can. Alright.

1642
02:34:14,700 --> 02:34:18,720
The way Listless works, ok we haven't done Listless in a long time but the way Listless

1643
02:34:18,720 --> 02:34:23,200
works because you know how we have this obsession in our society where we have to create the

1644
02:34:23,200 --> 02:34:28,620
top list. Like we have to have the top 3 of all time. Actually can I have the tube? Can

1645
02:34:28,620 --> 02:34:36,100
I have the tube for a minute? It's the top 3 of all time. My god, we're so sad now that

1646
02:34:36,100 --> 02:34:40,580
we use the tube as a special effect. Alright. So we're gonna come up with the top 3 list

1647
02:34:40,580 --> 02:34:43,980
of all time. And the top 3 list we're gonna do tonight, tonight's topic, and I'm gonna

1648
02:34:43,980 --> 02:34:46,820
to give you guys the break to come up with it. If you guys in the chat room

1649
02:34:46,820 --> 02:34:51,460
have suggestions, you can start posting there in the chat room www.orensontrader.com.

1650
02:34:51,460 --> 02:34:56,100
Okay, top three. Here it is. This is inspired by a chat that some folks in

1651
02:34:56,100 --> 02:35:02,460
the chat room were having before the show. Beatmania 2DX. Rumor is that

1652
02:35:02,460 --> 02:35:06,460
someday, somehow, they're going to bring it over to the USA, but they can't really

1653
02:35:06,460 --> 02:35:12,980
call it Beatmania 2DX because there was no Beatmania DX. Now, you can't really

1654
02:35:12,980 --> 02:35:19,400
call it hip-hop mania either because that's gay. So, we have to come up with a new name

1655
02:35:19,400 --> 02:35:25,260
for Beatmania 2DX. So tonight we're gonna come up with the top three names for Beatmania

1656
02:35:25,260 --> 02:35:33,260
2DX in America of all time. Your head does not have the water for properties of the tube!

1657
02:35:33,260 --> 02:35:42,960
Okay, remember guys, top three names for Beatmania 2DX's American release of all time. Now if

1658
02:35:42,960 --> 02:35:46,840
course, to humor those people that are going to get out there and go,

1659
02:35:46,840 --> 02:35:50,160
well, you know, Orange Lounge Radio, you fags,

1660
02:35:50,160 --> 02:35:54,640
what they should do is just call it Beatmania 2DX.

1661
02:35:54,640 --> 02:35:58,680
Who cares? Okay, I understand that.

1662
02:35:58,680 --> 02:36:04,080
Speaking of that, my stipulation, though, is that nobody can pick Beatmania 2DX as the title.

1663
02:36:04,080 --> 02:36:07,760
Yeah, that's a given. And nobody can say Hip-Hop Mania 2, either.

1664
02:36:07,760 --> 02:36:08,680
Be more creative.

1665
02:36:08,680 --> 02:36:12,560
Actually, I hear people call it Beatmania 2DX, Be Me A Two Dicks.

1666
02:36:12,560 --> 02:36:17,560
So okay, beat me with two dicks. Is that what you just said? Beat me with two dicks. Beat you with two dicks? I can have that arranged.

1667
02:36:17,560 --> 02:36:20,560
Alright. Not by me of course. Alright.

1668
02:36:24,560 --> 02:36:25,560
Quiet.

1669
02:36:28,560 --> 02:36:34,560
Alright, so just humor us a little bit you guys. We're coming up with new names, okay? Alright.

1670
02:36:35,560 --> 02:36:41,560
In the meantime, we're going to go to a break featuring some tracks from Beatmania 2DX. Go figure.

1671
02:36:41,560 --> 02:36:45,280
I mean, who knew that I would want to choose those kinds of songs?

1672
02:36:45,280 --> 02:36:46,280
You want to hear the safari?

1673
02:36:46,280 --> 02:36:47,280
You want to hear the safari?

1674
02:36:47,280 --> 02:36:50,560
Alright, we'll do the safari, because the safari has been in like every two years.

1675
02:36:50,560 --> 02:36:51,560
Alright, we'll be back.

1676
02:43:50,560 --> 02:44:20,520
Hello everybody and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

1677
02:44:20,520 --> 02:44:22,560
We're about to get this listless segment underway.

1678
02:44:22,560 --> 02:44:27,480
Remember that we are trying to find the top three names

1679
02:44:27,480 --> 02:44:30,960
that they could call Beatmania 2DX

1680
02:44:30,960 --> 02:44:32,360
if they released it in the US,

1681
02:44:32,360 --> 02:44:34,640
because you can't call it 2DX,

1682
02:44:34,640 --> 02:44:36,320
because there was no one.

1683
02:44:36,320 --> 02:44:37,440
Of course, then you could argue

1684
02:44:37,440 --> 02:44:39,260
that HipHopMania would be the name,

1685
02:44:39,260 --> 02:44:41,560
but that's gay, so we're not gonna call it that either.

1686
02:44:41,560 --> 02:44:44,700
So we're gonna find a new name for it here.

1687
02:44:46,640 --> 02:44:49,400
Or for anybody that plays Final Fantasy XI with me,

1688
02:44:49,400 --> 02:44:50,400
It's so teets.

1689
02:44:50,400 --> 02:44:51,400
Alright.

1690
02:44:51,400 --> 02:44:52,400
Yes.

1691
02:44:52,400 --> 02:44:53,400
What?

1692
02:44:53,400 --> 02:44:54,400
Yes.

1693
02:44:54,400 --> 02:44:55,400
Dark Saturday.

1694
02:44:55,400 --> 02:44:56,400
You need.

1695
02:44:56,400 --> 02:44:57,400
It's right.

1696
02:44:57,400 --> 02:44:58,400
Well, you threw it on the floor.

1697
02:44:58,400 --> 02:44:59,400
Somebody did.

1698
02:44:59,400 --> 02:45:00,400
Rob.

1699
02:45:00,400 --> 02:45:01,400
Yes.

1700
02:45:01,400 --> 02:45:02,400
Addict.

1701
02:45:02,400 --> 02:45:14,720
Then again, I'm over here chatting with two people about PSL.

1702
02:45:14,720 --> 02:45:15,720
I know.

1703
02:45:15,720 --> 02:45:16,720
You're like, oh, I'm going to go home.

1704
02:45:16,720 --> 02:45:17,720
I'm going to play PSL all night.

1705
02:45:17,720 --> 02:45:24,720
I'm going to try to find some game show music here but I don't know if I have anything.

1706
02:45:27,400 --> 02:45:28,160
Damn it!

1707
02:45:28,160 --> 02:45:30,160
Price is Right music!

1708
02:45:30,160 --> 02:45:33,400
I kind of have Price is Right music. Actually I do have an idea of what we can do.

1709
02:45:33,400 --> 02:45:35,560
We need Plinko music!

1710
02:45:35,560 --> 02:45:38,600
There is no Plinko music!

1711
02:45:38,600 --> 02:45:40,480
We need the yodeling one.

1712
02:45:40,480 --> 02:45:43,800
Do you know which one that is?

1713
02:45:43,800 --> 02:45:50,800
goes to the mountain. No, I got a better idea. We're gonna do this one. It's not that it's

1714
02:45:51,960 --> 02:45:58,960
a... Okay, seriously, stop. That's right, everybody. It's time to play List List. Tonight's

1715
02:46:07,120 --> 02:46:12,880
celebrities for List List will be determining our list of the top three names for BeatMania

1716
02:46:12,880 --> 02:46:15,880
2DX in America of all time!

1717
02:46:15,880 --> 02:46:17,880
Say hello to DarkSagra!

1718
02:46:17,880 --> 02:46:18,880
Oh shit, my clothes are done.

1719
02:46:18,880 --> 02:46:21,880
Say hello to Loki!

1720
02:46:21,880 --> 02:46:22,880
Doo-doo-doo!

1721
02:46:22,880 --> 02:46:25,880
Say hello to DDR Angel!

1722
02:46:25,880 --> 02:46:26,880
Um, hi.

1723
02:46:26,880 --> 02:46:29,880
Say hello to Arcadia42!

1724
02:46:29,880 --> 02:46:30,880

I can't believe it's not B-Mania 2DX!

1736
02:47:20,120 --> 02:47:21,600
Why that name?

1737
02:47:21,600 --> 02:47:23,540
Any reason why?

1738
02:47:23,540 --> 02:47:25,600
Because it's not.

1739
02:47:25,600 --> 02:47:26,400
Loki!

1740
02:47:26,400 --> 02:47:28,280
You're number three.

1741
02:47:28,280 --> 02:47:31,480
Super Toast!

1742
02:47:31,480 --> 02:47:32,960
Super Toast!

1743
02:47:32,960 --> 02:47:35,440
Any reason why you're calling it Super Toast?

1744
02:47:35,440 --> 02:47:42,440
That was better than normal toast.

1745
02:47:42,440 --> 02:47:45,440
All right, DDR Angel, you're number three.

1746
02:47:45,440 --> 02:47:49,440
She needs more time. You got a number three at least? You got one?

1747
02:47:49,440 --> 02:47:53,440
Okay, Jamie can scream at it now.

1748
02:47:53,440 --> 02:47:54,440
What?

1749
02:47:54,440 --> 02:47:56,440
Because, it's funny.

1750
02:47:56,440 --> 02:48:00,440
Okay, I don't know if Rob's gonna laugh when he's DDR-ing so it's not good.

1751
02:48:00,440 --> 02:48:01,440
Just say it already.

1752
02:48:01,440 --> 02:48:03,440
Spinning Totomaster.

1753
02:48:03,440 --> 02:48:04,440
Spinning what?

1754
02:48:04,440 --> 02:48:05,440
No, that's not right.

1755
02:48:05,440 --> 02:48:06,440
Spinning Tarumania.

1756
02:48:06,440 --> 02:48:07,440
Spinning Tarumania!

1757
02:48:07,440 --> 02:48:19,040
Why would I laugh at a Final Fantasy XI joke?

1758
02:48:19,040 --> 02:48:20,040
Alright.

1759
02:48:20,040 --> 02:48:21,840
There's a lot of games out there.

1760
02:48:21,840 --> 02:48:27,840
My number three pick, because I was thinking that they want to actually sell copies of

1761
02:48:27,840 --> 02:48:31,840
this game, so they'd have to borrow from another franchise, so my number three pick for a name

1762
02:48:31,840 --> 02:48:47,460
would be rumbleroses2. Rumbleroses2! Alright, uh, Arcadian42 and explicit, what number three

1763
02:48:47,460 --> 02:48:52,120
name did you come up with? We're gonna do it separately. Can we? You can do it separately,

1764
02:48:52,120 --> 02:48:56,560
that's fine. Alright, you're number three Arcadian. Okay, uh, I'm planning to do it

1765
02:48:56,560 --> 02:49:09,320

02:49:18,160 --> 02:49:24,160
Beatbox Revolution! Any reason why?

1768
02:49:24,160 --> 02:49:27,160
Okay, that's gross sounding.

1769
02:49:27,160 --> 02:49:29,160
I explained it.

1770
02:49:29,160 --> 02:49:35,160
Alright, let's go on to our number two picks, starting off with Jamie.

1771
02:49:35,160 --> 02:49:37,160
Button Smashing Game.

1772
02:49:37,160 --> 02:49:43,160
Button Smashing Game!

1773
02:49:43,160 --> 02:49:46,160
Loki, your number two pick.

Alright, Angel, your number two pick.

1778
02:50:13,640 --> 02:50:14,640

DJ Spin Master!

1781
02:50:25,140 --> 02:50:30,640
My number two pick, again going with the theme of they actually want to sell copies of this game in the US, would be...

1782
02:50:31,140 --> 02:50:34,140
MTV presents Britney Mania 2005.

1783
02:50:34,140 --> 02:50:37,140

mix it up!

1790
02:51:04,140 --> 02:51:06,140
Any reason why?

1791
02:51:06,140 --> 02:51:10,140
Well, since everyone's talking about the losses with the DDR public scene,

1792
02:51:10,140 --> 02:51:12,140
maybe they'll come out with a fire back saying,

1793
02:51:12,140 --> 02:51:15,140
let's call it mix it up, so let's go pump it up's name.

1794
02:51:15,140 --> 02:51:19,140
Oh, okay, we'll play on pump it up there, I got it, alright.

1795
02:51:19,140 --> 02:51:24,140
Alright, let's see, Jamie, your number one pick, number one!

1796
02:51:24,140 --> 02:51:29,140
Um, pretend you're a real DJ, but not.

1797
02:51:29,140 --> 02:51:34,140
Pretend you're a real DJ, but not!

1798
02:51:34,140 --> 02:51:38,140
Is it but not or but you're not?

1799
02:51:38,140 --> 02:51:42,140
I'll have that, but not really.

1800
02:51:42,140 --> 02:51:46,140
Pretend you're a real DJ, but not really!

1801
02:51:46,140 --> 02:51:49,140
Loki, you're number one.

1802
02:51:49,140 --> 02:51:53,140

Super Monkey Wombat Cheese Burrito!

1805
02:52:07,140 --> 02:52:13,140
Any particular reason why you want to call a video game with falling bars, uh, Super Monkey Wombat Cheese Burrito?

1806
02:52:16,140 --> 02:52:17,140
Because it fits.

1807
02:52:17,140 --> 02:52:18,140
You're an idiot.

1808
02:52:18,140 --> 02:52:20,140
Alright, Angel!

1809
02:52:20,140 --> 02:52:24,140
Well if he's an idiot, my next one's not that much better, but I thought it was funny.

1810
02:52:24,140 --> 02:52:30,760
from a total noobs perspective oh shit there's too much to do the game oh shit

1811
02:52:30,760 --> 02:52:35,260
there's too much to do the game

1812
02:52:40,860 --> 02:52:47,380
my number one pick my number one pick I think really encompasses what the game

1813
02:52:47,380 --> 02:52:52,340
is really all about because I've been playing the money for a long long time

1814
02:52:52,340 --> 02:52:56,580
and I've been looking at the forums and everything and I think I've captured the name that really

1815
02:52:56,580 --> 02:53:05,420
shows what this game is all about. So my number one pick, Elitist Elitist Revolution. Elitist

1816

02:53:50,740 --> 02:54:05,540
All right, boy, we have a whole lot on this list here, and six of them are going to come

1827
02:54:05,540 --> 02:54:11,700
off this list right now. Let me read the list here. I can't believe it's not BeatMania 2DX,

1833
02:54:43,160 --> 02:54:46,000

1834
02:54:46,000 --> 02:54:53,000
Super Toast. Super Toast is Toast.

1835
02:54:53,000 --> 02:54:56,000
Loki, which one of these is coming off the list?

1836
02:54:56,000 --> 02:55:06,000
Sadly, Beatbox Revolution, because there is a beatboxing game coming out, and that's not beatboxing.

1837
02:55:06,000 --> 02:55:09,000
And that's another reason either.

1838
02:55:09,000 --> 02:55:15,000
Alright, Angel, which one of these has to come off the list?

1839
02:55:15,000 --> 02:55:19,400
It's like keys and stuff.

1840
02:55:19,400 --> 02:55:23,280
It's like keys and stuff, off the list.

1841
02:55:23,280 --> 02:55:28,040
I have to eliminate, sadly, sorry Angel, but spinning Tarou mania has got to come off the

1842
02:55:28,040 --> 02:55:29,040
list.

1843
02:55:29,040 --> 02:55:32,880
As much as I love Final Fantasy XI, even 2DX isn't that good.

1844
02:55:32,880 --> 02:55:33,880
I know, I know.

1845
02:55:33,880 --> 02:55:37,960

MTV presents Britney Mania 2005 because, in the words of Arkadian42, it's so over.

1848
02:55:50,720 --> 02:55:52,720
Alright.

1849
02:55:53,720 --> 02:55:55,720

02:55:58,720 --> 02:56:03,720
I'm gonna get on the forums and tell those orange orange radio people that Britney is so 2003, okay?

1852
02:56:04,720 --> 02:56:07,720
Jonas, you're the last one to get to eliminate something off the list. What is it?

1853
02:56:07,720 --> 02:56:12,720
I hate to say this, but I'll have to say Rumble Roses 2.

1854
02:56:12,720 --> 02:56:13,720
You bastard!

1855
02:56:13,720 --> 02:56:17,240
That was the best name on there.

1856
02:56:17,240 --> 02:56:21,440
Rumble Roses 2 is off the list.

1857
02:56:21,440 --> 02:56:22,440

Orange Lounge Radio, the post show or the after birth as we so lovingly called it for

2023
03:10:36,840 --> 03:10:40,640
these past two and a half years where we talk about all that other stuff that we didn't

2024
03:10:40,640 --> 03:10:44,080
get too quiet on the show. I can't believe we've been doing it this long. Oh my god,

2025
03:10:44,080 --> 03:10:48,800
it's seriously time to quit. Ah, stop quitting. No, I'm kidding, no. Quitter, quitter. We'll

2026
03:10:48,800 --> 03:10:51,560
be doing this right now. You know I got a fortune cookie today, it was really weird,

2027
03:10:51,560 --> 03:10:54,680
it said something about like, something you are focusing on, and I was thinking about

2028
03:10:54,680 --> 03:10:58,760
Orange Laundry when I read it, it said something you are focusing on, it will grow a lot in

2029
03:10:58,760 --> 03:11:03,720
this next year. It'll be very interesting to see what happens. Although we have a really

2030
03:11:03,720 --> 03:11:07,160
boring webcam, we seriously need to start pointing that somewhere else, like, we need

2031
03:11:07,160 --> 03:11:11,360
to get a goldfish or something you know when you're reading that fortune I was

2032
03:11:11,360 --> 03:11:14,520
thinking of my penis so

2033
03:11:14,880 --> 03:11:18,600
because you know you weren't here and stuff I had so much food today I went to

2034
03:11:18,600 --> 03:11:24,200
Panda Express I ate like a three combo did you break the webcam way to go I'm

2035
03:11:24,200 --> 03:11:32,020
so awesome that wasn't Jamie that was me if you can believe it you're belchy I

2036
03:11:32,020 --> 03:11:32,520
I know.

2037
03:11:32,520 --> 03:11:33,720
I am going home, bye!

2038
03:11:33,720 --> 03:11:36,020
You're going home? Fine.

2039
03:11:36,020 --> 03:11:38,020
I have to go home to my life.

2040
03:11:38,020 --> 03:11:40,020
Hey, you're going to E3s next year, right?

2041
03:11:40,020 --> 03:11:41,020
Well, yeah.

2042
03:11:41,020 --> 03:11:44,020
If we end up deciding to go to The Price is Right, will you go?

2043
03:11:44,020 --> 03:11:49,520
Cause, hearing Come on Down made me think of, you know, when I went to The Price is Right a couple years ago. It was so much fun.

2044
03:11:49,520 --> 03:11:50,520
Sure.

2045
03:11:50,520 --> 03:11:52,020

2047
03:11:53,520 --> 03:11:55,020
Oh my god, I found a contestant.

2048
03:11:55,020 --> 03:11:56,020
We all have to wear-

2049
03:11:56,020 --> 03:12:00,020
Oh my god, if you were a contestant on that show, I'd pee myself, because you'd be so shy.

2050
03:12:00,020 --> 03:12:01,020
I'd pee if I go-

2051
03:12:01,020 --> 03:12:05,020
I'd be like, yeah. Oh my god!

2052
03:12:05,020 --> 03:12:09,020
I wouldn't be one of those screamy, happy, clappy people. Hi, hi! You girls are ugly!

2053
03:12:09,020 --> 03:12:13,020
I wouldn't be one of those screamy, happy, clappy people.

2054
03:12:13,020 --> 03:12:17,020
I'd be like, wow.

2055
03:12:17,020 --> 03:12:21,020
I suppose I'd pick this. You'd have an orgasm and you know it. No I wouldn't.

2056
03:12:21,020 --> 03:12:25,020
Don't touch me. Oh my god, you're orange.

2057
03:12:25,020 --> 03:12:29,020
I want to go, and we all should wear matching shirts.

2058
03:12:29,020 --> 03:12:32,260
We can hype it up on the station and have it be the big Orange Launch Radio Television

2059
03:12:32,260 --> 03:12:33,260
debut.

2060
03:12:33,260 --> 03:12:34,260
As an internet radio.

2061
03:12:34,260 --> 03:12:35,260
Weird.

2062
03:12:35,260 --> 03:12:36,260
Well, we'll hype it up.

2063
03:12:36,260 --> 03:12:37,900
The Orange Launch Radio Television debut.

2064
03:12:37,900 --> 03:12:38,900
I like that idea.

2065
03:12:38,900 --> 03:12:39,900
Okay.

2066
03:12:39,900 --> 03:12:40,900
Alright.

2067
03:12:40,900 --> 03:12:41,900
We'll see what happens.

2068
03:12:41,900 --> 03:12:44,860
Except when one of us walks behind the G4 camera.

2069
03:12:44,860 --> 03:12:45,860
Alright.

2070
03:12:45,860 --> 03:12:46,860
Bye.

2071
03:12:46,860 --> 03:12:47,860
Alright.

2072
03:12:47,860 --> 03:12:49,500
Have a good night, Jamie.

2073
03:12:49,500 --> 03:12:50,580
Thanks for coming.

2074
03:12:50,580 --> 03:12:51,820
And anybody else want to add anything?

2075
03:12:51,820 --> 03:12:55,620
Now you're dying to see The Price is Right live in person, aren't you, somebody looking?

2076
03:12:55,620 --> 03:12:59,620
I watched that show since I've been five.

2077
03:12:59,620 --> 03:13:02,620
Oh, really? What was on it last week?

2078
03:13:02,620 --> 03:13:08,620
It was some white trash bastard winning a Buick or something, I don't know.

2079
03:13:08,620 --> 03:13:09,620
Perfect!

2080
03:13:09,620 --> 03:13:11,620
Wow, you got it! I'm amazed!

2081
03:13:11,620 --> 03:13:14,620
Alright, bye Jamie, have a good night, and you know what?

2082
03:13:14,620 --> 03:13:16,620
Good night to the rest of you guys, too. Have a good one.

2083
03:13:16,620 --> 03:13:19,620
Thank you very much for tuning into and supporting Orange Launch Radio.

2084
03:13:19,620 --> 03:13:21,620
We do appreciate it, as always.

2085
03:13:21,620 --> 03:13:28,620
post-show tonight, you get some Taku. Not a taco, but a Taku. Enjoy.

2086
03:16:21,620 --> 03:16:23,620

The most difficult thing I've ever tried to do is to clear the mind of a human being.
