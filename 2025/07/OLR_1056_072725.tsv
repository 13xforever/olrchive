10190	36113	... ... ... ...
39637	42100	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
42120	46184	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
46204	47986	It is Orange Lawns Radio.
48026	48726	Yes, I'm laughing.
48746	49727	I'll explain myself in a minute.
50248	61139	Hi, we're live and I'm here, myself, Rob Roberts, joined by my incredible co-host tonight, July 27th, 2025, for episode number 1056 of our show.
61159	64142	First off, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
64797	86721	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
86701	89810	We were talking about his drive because, you know, he's recording on the road right now.
90612	95526	And I was talking about the town of Winnemucca, Nevada as a place to stop.
95947	99597	And I guess I was saying things about – and Alan at some point just went –
99982	101424	Stop saying that.
101444	105309	Like, you can't stand the sound of the name of that town.
105329	111878	Because I was like, oh, yeah, I once had to stop there because I had to have Porta Subs, which is an amazing Nevada sandwich chain.
111938	114922	And it's on the way to Boise when I was going to see friends there and all this stuff.
114982	116344	And it's just the way Alan was.
116364	119668	So now it's become a joke between Jason and I. So he sent me a picture.
119828	120389	It's really funny.
120409	126097	He sent me a picture from a casino in Winnemucca where the sign just, like, brightly is lit up.
126117	126778	It says Winnemucca.
126798	127879	And he's just making this...
128905	152837	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
152817	167130	Well, they all can't be Sly Dell, Louisiana.
168967	171770	At least Fly Adele has a Waffle House and some trees.
172731	176215	I don't think there are any Waffle Houses in Nevada.
176235	177056	I don't think there are.
177076	177556	There are not.
177576	178257	There's not in Vegas.
178277	179278	There's not in Arizona.
179638	181040	Yeah, Arizona, but not Nevada.
181841	189349	Actually, the furthest west I have eaten at a Waffle House was, I think, St.
189449	189809	Louis.
191110	193573	Oh, the first Waffle House I ever went to was in Tucson.
194988	195949	Or was it the second?
196089	198873	Maybe Atlanta did beat it.
198953	205101	I literally do not know the first Waffle House that I went to because I probably could not form proper memories at that time.
206283	207244	That's funny.
207264	210929	I know the first Waffle House Alan went to was in Tucson.
211169	216396	But maybe I did go at one point in the DragonCon years before I actually was at the Tucson one.
216416	217958	But anyway, who cares?
217979	218519	It's a Waffle House.
218539	224187	You know when you go to a Waffle House when you're out there, you have to go behind the counter and order me some grits.
224207	224387	Ha ha ha!
224367	225391	A Bag of Grits.
225411	227078	I know, it's the thing you miss most.
227179	229770	It's like a dollar.
230151	231778	How long does A Bag of Grits last you?
233260	235582	It depends.
236303	238906	I haven't finished my last one and I got it a couple months ago.
239166	239687	Oh, there you go.
239967	242069	I have to make sure that it's okay.
242570	249017	It's a little bit hard to do their grits at home because they're saltier when I make them for some reason and I don't add salt.
249938	257646	So I think, I don't know, but I freaking love good... I mean, these are like instant grits almost.
257686	262491	They're really quick and very fluffy and dense and delicious.
262910	272847	So since we're Orange Lounge Foodio a little bit, I will say this because, you know, when you're from California and you say we don't have Waffle House here, it's like, oh, well, we have Denny's.
272887	273488	Yeah, we do.
273508	274730	I went to that one downtown.
274770	275872	No, that's not Waffle House.
275992	276513	No, it's not.
276533	278857	Yeah, we have Waffle House knockoffs or Denny's.
279398	281441	Oh, that's why we don't have Waffle House here.
281501	282082	Hi, Loki.
282182	282523	How are you?
282543	284186	Tech Master Loki wants to talk about food.
284226	285087	Hi, Loki.
285067	286149	Blue.
286169	288252	No, they have like Waffle Squares and things like that.
288272	289194	They're all knockoffs.
289214	294423	They're all knockoffs of what... But the actual Waffle House chain will not play with our wage laws.
294463	295425	That's why they won't build them here.
297148	299992	Yeah, I heard that directly from a franchisor.
301094	302477	People say, well, you have Denny's.
302497	305542	And Denny's is everywhere here in California.
305602	307345	But here's my take.
307325	315542	You're sleeping on what I think is the better West Coast cafe, diner type of place, and that's Black Bear Diner.
315562	322175	I think that's the place that I would much rather go there than Denny's any day of the week.
322195	323538	It's marginally better.
323638	326143	That's the thing I think people on the East Coast are missing.
326410	338190	Black Bear was kind of like what we would do for... I would go with Danielle's family, part of my ballet group, because we never wanted to go to Chevy's.
338210	342077	And we would always go to Black Bear, although this time we went to Red Robin after Swan Lake.
343039	348748	But it's just like comfort food, and they have decent mimosas, and they will give you the bottle.
350732	350832	Yeah.
351638	361595	and, yeah, but I still, like, if you, you know, could teleport me into any one of those, I would always choose the Waffle House first.
361615	362657	I guess, I guess.
362737	366884	Anyway, Rama in chat says, hey, hey, Japanese Denny's is amazing.
366964	371933	Okay, you can't compare international versions to American versions because they're never the same.
371993	374096	And that goes, that's good and bad.
374117	375639	So I'm sure Japanese Denny's is better.
375839	377342	But, you know, they also have, like,
377322	392715	I saw an article on that today Finally
392695	398142	There's almost no Sears left, but yeah, I think that one is also closing.
398222	403989	I want to say there's something like 90 of them in Mexico, but it's because it's not the same thing.
404029	409957	I think Woolworths is still a thing in some countries, but not here.
410097	418247	Woolworths overseas was quite a bit different than the Woolworths here, and we had a Woolworths in Mobile, Florida.
418227	420899	All the way up through when I was in high school.
420939	425439	But I remember Woolworths also had a little lunch counter or something.
426021	426162	Mm-hmm.
426952	446406	Target in Australia is also a bit different.
446767	450774	So tell me one thing.
450914	451575	Hmm.
451724	452988	This is going way back.
453770	457300	Do you remember when Howard Johnson's had an ice cream parlor?
457480	458784	Not the Hojo's.
458804	459345	Oh my God.
459706	464500	I don't remember the ones here ever having them.
464560	465141	Not in the inns.
465162	467488	You mean like a standalone ice cream parlor?
468177	469279	Exactly.
469459	481798	I don't know that I ever saw one out here, because it used to be all about the thrifty ice cream counter at the thrifty drugstore, which became the Rite Aid drugstore, which became the Walgreens drugstore, which I think are going out of business.
481818	486586	I don't know if there's any thrifty ice cream counters left, but that used to be the big ice cream thing.
486606	491974	They have a sign for one in the Folsom one, but I don't know if that's...
492393	493054	Still the case.
493414	500402	The last time I went into one, which was in Citrus Heights, which is closed now, they did have an ice cream counter, but no one was there.
500922	502244	So I don't know.
502704	504646	The one in Pocket had one, too.
504666	506849	I don't know if that's still open or not, but I used to go there.
507109	514297	I know that the Howard Johnson and Mobile had one all the way up through the 80s, and I think it finally closed out like right before the 90s.
514337	516159	But they had like a peppermint stick flavor.
516239	519042	Oh, wait, because Howard Johnson's is actually a restaurant, isn't it?
519190	523695	Yeah, Howard Johnson was their restaurant, but they were primarily, their ice cream was the big thing.
524596	525957	I associate that name with a hotel.
526658	528640	That's, like, there's one by Disneyland, right?
528660	529641	Or there was, yeah.
530161	538149	Yeah, and it's the same company in general, but they had, like, their big thing was 28 flavors of ice cream, and that was their thing.
538189	539651	You know what that makes me think of?
540232	542214	Sorry, we do talk about video games, I promise.
542634	546598	Fry's Electronics and Fry's Groceries.
547304	549388	We're like... Okay, I never knew Fry's Groceries.
549508	552914	Oh, yeah, because I want to say that's a thing in Arizona, is Fry's Groceries.
552934	554256	It was in the Bay Area, too.
554276	555278	It was in the Bay Area, too?
555298	556220	See, and now Fry's Electronics.
556240	559626	I don't know if Fry's Groceries is still there, but obviously Fry's Electronics isn't.
560607	562330	Well, no, I'm going to take that back.
562371	566257	Fry's... I remember we had a Fry's in Antioch, California.
567660	567760	Okay.
568330	597915	and I can't remember if that one was also fries in San Jose one of those used to be in Alpha Beta and then it became a fries actually I have seen a fries grocery when my mom lived in Phoenix so yeah that's the other thing that comes to mind when I think of like a name that was in multiple things yeah so anyway alright just bring me back some Puddin' Pops they're probably all Kroger anyways I mean it's everything's Kroger
598705	602549	and open a Whataburger around the corner from my house and I'll be happy.
602709	604771	Whataburger or Waterburger?
606112	606953	It's Whataburger.
607353	609975	I'm all southern right now, Rob.
610115	612297	A Whataburger from Nintendo?
613358	614820	I didn't think that place was very good.
614880	616782	Anyway, alright.
617402	619064	Oh my god, you heathens.
619284	620105	You heathens.
620565	621366	You know what?
621906	626991	When somebody says they don't like food, when somebody says they don't like food, you say, more for me.
627772	628172	That's it.
628591	630313	Except there's not one here!
633077	634139	Alright.
634159	640127	Moving on, I want to get to the gaming news, or in this case, maybe news affecting the gaming industry.
640227	644032	Loki, quite a bunch of hubba-baloo going on this week.
644933	650301	And actually, leaving people wondering if you were caught up in the crossfire, Loki, with this story.
650321	650882	I was not.
651142	655628	I don't think my game's marked NSFW anyways.
655608	661982	Bobby did some investigative journalism during his show, and it was discovered that, yes, you still can find pixel poops.
662203	663145	Tell us what this is all about.
663405	664227	We're getting ahead of ourselves.
665069	672385	Yeah, so there's a group, I think it's out of Australia, the Collective Shout group.
672365	693563	um that basically has been putting pressure on payment processors we talked about this last week with Steam and how they were cracking down on certain um not safe for work games or with adult themes and stuff I think one that they were cracking down on even was like like furry games because they were saying oh it's bestiality or something like that
693543	721592	whatever the case may be they were cracking down on a bunch of stuff and now that has spread to itch.io as well which has also cracked down on a bunch of games and even some that aren't necessarily they're not necessarily adult in that sense obviously overreach with LGBTQ plus games that have been affected by it as well
721690	743209	but yeah so there's a lot of games that have been shadow banned and also they have blocked payments for those games as well so if you're making money on those games all of a sudden now you're not able to access those funds which is stupid because those rules weren't in place to begin with and now they are it's like well hold on like you should be able to have some sort of grace period or something like that
743189	752507	but also we shouldn't just let you know these watchdog groups or whatever like pressure everybody into doing things um
753567	754328	So you have that.
754428	761499	Of course, we even had some larger developers calling this out as well.
762220	782089	So the director of Nier Automata, Yoko Taro, was talking about this is basically censorship because we are allowing these companies to essentially bypass the normal regulations to now crack down on free speech.
782069	789868	Basically saying, you know, it implies that by controlling the payment processing companies, you can even censor another country's free speech.
790229	799352	I feel it's not just a matter of censoring adult content or jeopardizing freedom of expression, but rather a security hold and dangerous democracy itself.
799332	827635	and I think he was more talking about Manga Library Z which also got hit with this as well because essentially anything with an NSFW tag on HIO was delisted I think you can still get to it if you have the page directly but you can't search for it which effectively kills the discovery of games outside of social media platforms and things of that sort so obviously there was some
827615	833143	Really gross shit out there on these marketplaces that did have a reason to be dealt with.
833484	837189	But now this is a case of a massive overcorrection.
837730	847344	And I think truly what it seems to me truly a case of a activist group not working in our best interest.
847624	849447	You give them an inch and they take a mile.
849808	853453	That is basically I think how we've ended up in this situation.
853619	857866	Well, it sounds like these payment processors have too much power anyway.
858206	860290	Actually, can I say something about all that?
860790	866059	I'm really going to regret saying this, but I have to call it like I see it.
866079	871087	This whole thing, I know, brace yourselves, I'm going to wince when these words leave my mouth.
871748	876876	This whole thing is the first good argument I've heard for cryptocurrency.
879421	879861	Gross.
880422	880863	Gross.
881503	885948	But I think that speaks to the nature of these big payment... Let's not jump to that.
885968	887670	I know, I know, I know.
887790	889532	Y'all put the pitchfork and torches down.
889592	891755	There's still a lot about it that bothers me.
891835	900324	But I think it definitely says something about the fact that these folks, these payment processors, control way too much in the room.
900344	907352	And so I can see why people are turning to these alternative forms as a way to go around these payment processors.
909239	920132	Yeah, there's really no... What is the worry here that I'm going to think poorly of Visa or MasterCard?
920192	923095	I already think poorly of Visa and MasterCard.
923636	932967	There's not any amount of goodwill that they could do to have a positive... You are just a means to the end.
934108	939094	No one is like, oh, that family company Visa, I love them.
939074	940437	No one's saying that.
940798	955716	Interesting that we are talking about how companies are different in other countries, because correct me if I'm wrong, I swear I was reading somewhere, and it might have been in relation to all this, I don't remember, but they were talking about how, like, in Japan, you can pay for something online online.
955696	956397	and print.
956477	968975	Instead of using Visa or MasterCard, you basically get a barcode or a receipt number of some type, which you take to a 7-Eleven or an ITO or one of those stores that are very different in Japan than they are.
968995	970597	7-Eleven Japan is nothing like it is here.
970617	971779	There's no one's examples, right?
971799	974663	You take the barcode of one of those stores and you pay for it there.
975344	979270	And so it provides a payment alternative to Visa, MasterCard.
979290	981012	That's not something that's in our culture.
982274	983756	We don't really have the means to set up.
983776	986080	There's also just going in and buying stuff in the konbini.
987382	987903	Yeah.
989325	994553	Like you recharge your Suika card and your other type of travel cards and whatnot.
995215	998680	But a lot of stuff, like you buy tickets at a konbini.
998795	1019655	I kind of like that though I mean assuming that you could build it in a way that wouldn't be exploited because that's essentially almost like a VPN for payment processing in the sense because you essentially decouple it from the website now you just have this thing that's a transaction number essentially and you just take care of the transaction and Visa, MasterCard they don't know what it's for
1019635	1024921	This is the big brain idea you gamers need to get on because, you know, right now I understand.
1025001	1034492	I'm sorry, Loki, if you're going to get to this, but I understand there's a big telephone call campaign to Visa and stuff, which I understand that for, you know, trying to protest to get the message out there and so forth.
1034512	1040639	But like the big brain idea would be to launch that million dollar idea that's going to beat Visa, MasterCard at their own game.
1041040	1045845	And I thought something like Venmo is halfway there.
1045825	1053193	I really feel like, especially amongst younger folks, Venmo is a very standard method of payment.
1053233	1055195	Is Venmo and MasterCard tied together?
1055215	1056637	Is Venmo tied to one of the banks?
1056697	1057458	It has to be, right?
1058339	1059600	It has to be something.
1060401	1062023	Apple Pay or something like that?
1062163	1063204	It's PayPal.
1065847	1068070	Venmo is PayPal, but PayPal is Wells Fargo, isn't it?
1069131	1071934	Apple Card is Goldman Sachs.
1072437	1102073	But Apple Pay is not, I don't think.
1102053	1109423	So I do, to some extent, think some things are starting to move away from traditional payment processors.
1110725	1116313	It's just not moving as fast as we need to for something to happen about this particular story.
1116934	1118997	But I do think some of that culture is changing.
1119157	1120258	Anyway, sorry.
1120779	1126928	Well, it also gets complicated in the sense of, like, I don't know how refunding or anything, like, would work with all that.
1127028	1129251	And so that's a whole other bag of worms.
1129271	1129591	True, true.
1129612	1130052	That's fair.
1130192	1130693	That's fair.
1132428	1136193	So anyway, was there anything else with the thought there was one more?
1136313	1143161	Yeah, just just that there's also obviously because folks aren't really enjoying this thing happening.
1143562	1154335	They are, of course, launching a petition to tell MasterCard, Visa and activist groups stop controlling what we can watch, read or play.
1154315	1173218	and it describes it basically that this is corporate overreach and censorship of legal fictional content and of course it's already received 77,700 petitions as of about a week ago July 17th but
1173974	1183187	I mean, I don't know if it's going to do much, but at least, you know, you can let them know that you're not happy with this, and maybe they'll consider changing their mind.
1183268	1185771	But it's still weird, though.
1185811	1191219	Like, I don't think payment processors should say anything about speech.
1191640	1193743	Sure, block illegal activity.
1193763	1195846	Like, you know, you can try doing that, if you will.
1195906	1198890	But once again, even with that, that's kind of overreach as well.
1198910	1200032	Just...
1200788	1205340	function as an ATM or a transaction machine.
1205400	1209390	We don't need personality opinions in here.
1209611	1211997	You just do your function and that's it.
1214035	1220624	It's funny because some of you in chat are like, PayPal wants to know your location if you mention sex in your transaction messages.
1220644	1228075	And it really never occurred to me that these payment companies are looking at transaction messages because I have some people that I will go out to brunch with once in a while.
1228556	1231239	And I usually will put it on my card and have people Venmo me.
1231320	1235906	And they send me the most disgusting Venmo messages possible as to why they're paying me money.
1236166	1239351	I'm going to try to show you one without doxing somebody here.
1239736	1241339	I think I can do it.
1241359	1242742	Hold on.
1242762	1244044	Y'all aren't seeing nothing here.
1244345	1247751	I'm going to show you like an actual payment message I got.
1247812	1248433	Do you see that?
1249254	1251358	That's a bottle of lotion.
1251378	1256789	And the thing is that a lot of other people can see these messages.
1257049	1257470	Yeah, I know.
1257490	1258292	That's why they do it.
1259234	1261558	That's why they leave those types of things.
1263597	1281268	it's for the lotion that you bought at Bed Bath & Beyond or Bed & Body Works it was for fucking chilaquiles it was not for foot lotion, god your pedicure and you went out for eggplant parmesan afterwards so I mean that's, yeah
1284117	1300843	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1300823	1305671	Rage against customer service, but when I say that, I hope y'all are keeping it in the back of your mind.
1305711	1310379	The people that are taking your call are not the ones that are setting the policy at Visa.
1310559	1315307	And if y'all act foolish, that's just going to be what this movement is going to look like, is foolish.
1315768	1316048	But
1316028	1322779	If you act professional in being on the phone and expressing your distaste to this, all of those calls are logged.
1322880	1334319	They may tell you to email a thing, which you could do as well, but make sure that your distaste, your grievance, we shall say the formal term, the grievance is logged.
1334680	1336703	So that way Visa has a record of this.
1336683	1340268	So, yeah, Ranmari in chat says emails can be filtered out, though.
1340328	1340789	They can.
1341109	1344534	I mean, I think legally they have to still track them, but that's it.
1344554	1345816	You're a stat.
1345836	1347018	You're a stat at that point.
1347398	1357894	But if you're on the phone, now that's impacting their call volume, the amount of time, the amount of calls come in, the other calls that aren't getting picked up because they're having to answer to this.
1357914	1360938	It's a very interesting method of protest.
1360958	1365745	And, yeah, I agree again with Ranmari's perspective in chat over Twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
1365725	1375019	and I don't think I said it earlier because we do tape live at twitch.tv slash VOG Network, the Voice Geeks Network, every Sunday night at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwell show.
1375099	1377483	By the way, 20 years old this week.
1377623	1379546	Our baby cousin turned 20 this week.
1379566	1380427	Congratulations, Bobby.
1380707	1380808	Nice.
1380828	1382089	Congratulations.
1382150	1384493	Ranmari live in chat says, kill them with kindness.
1384962	1388051	Yeah, I mean, they have... They log their calls.
1388071	1395332	They usually, like, will... Any call center will usually tag their calls based off of whatever the criteria is about.
1395954	1399123	And they have, like, what they call, like, kind of...
1399795	1428604	not heat reports but it's basically something to the sense of like they're trying to get a like pick up on trends that are happening with you know the call center what type of calls are coming in so they you do want to be polite to obviously the people doing it because most of the time it's even like probably with visas call centers are not even associated with visa they're just using those employees to kind of take those calls but they still track that stuff for metrics so that they can
1428652	1429614	Yeah.
1429714	1443083	Yeah.
1443400	1446484	And yeah, Ranmari says, I worked in customer service.
1446524	1447806	I currently work in medical billing.
1447886	1450911	I get the occasional call of people yelling at me for things that aren't my fault.
1450971	1458201	Yeah, please, please don't be foolish on the phone with these folks that are not the people that are coming up with policy.
1458442	1460424	They are paid to take the calls from angry people.
1460464	1461466	You don't have to be one of them.
1462147	1465071	In fact, I would argue you're going to get noticed more
1465051	1466012	by folks.
1466112	1469457	If you call in, you're actually nice about it because people, they're going to talk.
1469477	1470699	Those reps are going to talk about this.
1470999	1474304	You getting those people that called today talking about the payment thing on Steam?
1474624	1477288	Yeah, they're really nice, but there's a lot of it.
1477368	1478149	They're going to talk.
1478930	1482916	Just remember, call centers, a lot of times they're like, you know, entry-level jobs.
1483217	1486040	A lot of people that are of that age play video games.
1486601	1491027	I mean, maybe even aware of what's going on at the company and aren't happy about it too.
1491048	1491368	That's right.
1491388	1492990	Start a revolt from within.
1493010	1494973	Do you hear the people sing?
1495780	1524049	That's the goal.
1524468	1534440	It's certainly... We're seeing, not just with payment processors, there's a lot of things that are attacking free speech and trying to censor things across the entire world.
1534460	1538585	Like, it's just... I wonder if that's not how this ultimately ends.
1538605	1552602	And I don't think on the itch.io front, but, you know, say a game like a Grand Theft Auto gets banned by this whole thing in the future, because you know Grand Theft Auto is going to be a big fucking deal when it comes out, and it's going to catch the attention of one of these, you know...
1552582	1561011	Anti-free speech organizations that will be trying to get the payment processors to not take money for Grand Theft Auto.
1561352	1568279	And then a big company basically sues the payment processors over their rights to what they can sell.
1568319	1575707	And yes, I know free speech does not apply to private corporations, but nothing in this country makes any legal sense anymore.
1575727	1577690	And we're suing people over everything.
1577710	1580092	And that's starting at the highest office in the land.
1580112	1581694	So I...
1581674	1587516	If you ask me to say what's going to happen, I think it ends in a lawsuit because that's where everything is going these days.
1587985	1589487	I did watch that South Park, by the way.
1590108	1590869	It was so good.
1591870	1602324	Did you know the way they were able to get away with showing that on TV was that they put two little eyeballs on it, like little Michael's craft eyeballs on that.
1603786	1605769	That whole part was AI anyway.
1606210	1611477	Yeah, which I don't agree with using AI, but It's their own company.
1611837	1613319	They own an AI company.
1613499	1616203	A point was made
1616960	1624407	Okay, but I will say I will never hear the Billy Idol song Eyes Without a Face the same way ever again.
1624427	1627349	Bobby Blackwell says Comedy Central TTP.
1627589	1640681	I wanted to say, though, because I thought this was an interesting comment from SSJ100 Matt in chat who says, So you get fired from your big game studio job and you try to make your games on the indie market, but your game gets taken down because it's offensive to some troll group.
1640981	1642442	This industry isn't fun right now.
1642823	1644684	And this is what I'm also worried about.
1644804	1646646	You know, and it's...
1646626	1662660	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1662640	1682438	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1683127	1694447	It is not... If a drag queen wants to read books to kids at the library, like when I was young, a clown would do at the library.
1695148	1696670	Sorry, but that's what it was.
1697432	1701338	And for some reason, the right has a problem with one and not the other.
1702000	1704544	So it's just...
1705098	1716419	Anyway, that's what I worry about is that they're going to try to say, well, because the game has drag queens in it, it's NSFW, it's an adult game, which then is because trans people are represented, it's NSFW.
1716439	1723472	Because, oh, gay people are in it, it's NSFW, which anything LGBTQIA+, it's NSFW.
1723492	1723693	What?
1724454	1724895	Right.
1724960	1737823	If Tammy Faye can wear all of that amount of makeup and cry on public TV reading fiction as well, I think that drag queens can wear all that makeup and cry in public and read fiction.
1737843	1738464	Oh, I'm with you.
1738504	1739526	You're preaching to the choir.
1739886	1741990	Now that's a religion I can get behind.
1743455	1743976	There we go.
1744357	1744657	Preach.
1745359	1747343	Tammy Faye was a drag queen.
1747784	1748204	She was.
1748545	1753335	Elvira was really one of the earliest as well.
1753355	1756060	And Tammy Faye did turn herself around a bit.
1756681	1758304	Yeah.
1758324	1758645	So...
1759840	1787299	Tami had a very interesting life anyway all right uh let's move on let's get into i mean we could we could talk all about Tami Faye uh for three hours but we're gonna talk about our gaming weeks instead and the types of video games that we have been playing this week so DarkSakura i'll start with you how was your gaming week um Mass Effect Dead by Daylight i'm trying to recapture my pig era again um Palia i've been doing quests in Palia um
1788983	1790645	Playing the Suika game.
1795332	1798837	I haven't really had time to do much more than my usual stuff.
1799478	1803644	Just because I went back to my Friday ballet class.
1804024	1808411	My whole schedule is going to be changing pretty soon.
1811415	1814119	Not in a bad way.
1814800	1815160	That's good.
1816001	1816622	I'll go to Loki then.
1816642	1817083	Your game of the week.
1818059	1819342	That's pretty much just Minecraft.
1819984	1826280	Still working on coding the data pack for my stuff and then I've been working on other things as well.
1826580	1827583	Just playing around in the game.
1828245	1830851	But yep, still Minecraft.
1830871	1832355	It's always the name Minecraft.
1832656	1834378	All right.
1834519	1837523	For me, I'm still getting my dailies done in Final Fantasy XIV.
1838424	1843992	I still play a little bit of Diablo 4, but not as much because I've just been playing other stuff.
1844713	1852844	And I will say I was doing, you know, some classic games this week, but I will say the one classic rabbit hole I fell down.
1853085	1853545	Oh, boy.
1853766	1854006	Oh, boy.
1854026	1856149	Loki, you'll appreciate this, though.
1856129	1862422	I started playing Final Fantasy XI again, but this one is one of those private servers.
1862562	1867433	They don't do a very good job keeping this a secret.
1868214	1873345	It's called Horizon, Horizon XI, which launched in...
1873983	1892464	Dune's Parties Warcraft Classic
1893473	1904950	It'll be interesting if Square Enix, because you know how we got official World of Warcraft Classic, was Blizzard finally shut down all the servers because they were going to do something official.
1904990	1908736	They sent cease and desist to all the private servers and started their own official thing.
1908776	1911099	I wonder if someday Square Enix doesn't do something official.
1911440	1918570	It still blows my mind that they charge money for Eleven and that it's not just grouped in like a Squeenix Pass event.
1918550	1934517	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1934497	1954547	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
1954527	1970055	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1970035	1997140	and uh but level syncing is there so if you want you could take your level 30 character sync it down to level 17 or whatever and go do a Valkyrm Dunes party you can do that and still gain most of the XP there is some penalties to the XP depending on how many people are signed on and all this all these other factors I'm not going to bore you with the stats but um it's interesting that they have put some of those quality of life because level sync was
1997120	2017255	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2017235	2019178	It's slow.
2020000	2020661	It's slow.
2020681	2023586	I think I've been playing for a couple hours and I may be level 7.
2024127	2026391	But it just took me forever to remember how to do shit.
2026411	2027573	Oh, it's so much fun though.
2027853	2030698	The nice thing about Horizon though, like everything is built in.
2031039	2034545	Like in the launcher, there's a lot of great add-ons.
2034565	2040475	There's one called Balloon that makes all the quest text look like Final Fantasy XIV.
2040455	2043861	and it will support 4K and all that.
2043881	2048129	So I'm pretty impressed by the Horizon stuff.
2048149	2060491	So kudos to everybody because that's a labor of love from Final Fantasy XI fans making those servers work with those tweaks that mostly keep it frozen in time but add the quality of life stuff.
2060931	2065720	I do believe they are adding Treasures of Ottergon pretty soon.
2065700	2070093	because you can't even do like Blue Mage, Corsair, any of the jobs they added in Otter Gone.
2070113	2073302	But that's something they're looking at adding in the relatively near future.
2073342	2074967	That's kind of interesting.
2076027	2077488	All right, otherwise, that was my game of the week.
2077548	2082353	We're going to get into some gaming news, just some quick notes of weeks we will not be here.
2082573	2090121	I'm going to be absent a couple weeks in August, so I will not be here on August the 17th, and I will not be here August the 31st.
2090221	2097648	I'm on a personal trip on the 17th, and on the 31st, I will be at DragonCon in Atlanta, as I have been for the past decade plus.
2098108	2105055	So as I usually say, and I hope I will see some of you there, if you're in the area, best time to catch me at DragonCon,
2105035	2111732	I don't know my full panel lineup yet and I won't until the app is released, which is like two weeks before the convention-ish.
2112233	2120935	But the one thing I do know will happen, I can promise, Thursday night we will have a mixer for the digital media track at...
2120915	2122517	7 o'clock?
2122537	2124300	Because I don't have it in front of me.
2125141	2127324	But look for that on Thursday night.
2127945	2131990	Bobby and I will be there and that is the best place to catch us during the frenzy of DragonCon.
2132010	2137417	So come have a nice chill Thursday night with us at the Digital Media Track on Thursday night.
2137437	2143986	Everything else I will mention closer to probably that show right before is when I will be able to talk about anything else I'm doing at the show.
2145609	2148192	Alright, let's get into some gaming news.
2149053	2150415	Loki, we'll start with you.
2150868	2156039	Well, we had a Pokemon Presents showcase that showed off a bunch of Pokemon updates.
2156861	2163816	Starting things off, of course, they had a DJ Pikachu animation thing, which is neat, I guess.
2164277	2164658	I don't know.
2164938	2165800	I watched some of it.
2165820	2169568	It was not the music I thought they'd be playing.
2170240	2171342	How's that news?
2171362	2172984	Sorry, that's not news.
2173004	2174406	That affects nothing in the Pokemon.
2174727	2175568	It was cute!
2176089	2177351	That's what's news about it.
2177691	2181597	There's going to be new episodes of Pokemon.
2181617	2184101	I got a Pikachu that's so old back there he's deflating.
2184161	2184842	Is that cute?
2185163	2186104	My little Pikachu pillow?
2187046	2187666	Is that cute?
2189429	2194517	Pokemon Concierge is going to be getting some new episodes starting September 4th.
2195639	2197902	So that'll be coming to Netflix.
2198337	2207912	We have the Pokemon Tales, The Misadventures of Sirfetch'd and Pichu, which is coming in 2027.
2211097	2213240	It's a new stop-motion series.
2213400	2215043	I'm doing a lot of animation stuff.
2216124	2221172	So that'll be... We're probably going to forget about it by the time it comes out in 2027.
2221743	2230432	Poke Park Kanto, a new outdoor attraction that is opening up in Japan that's made to look like a real forest.
2231253	2233295	And that is set to open up in 2026.
2233396	2236499	So that's kind of neat.
2238401	2239422	Pokemon Go.
2239522	2241304	It didn't look like it had rides or anything like that.
2241324	2243266	It looks like it's an Instagram park.
2243406	2245348	It's an Instagram park is what that place looks like.
2245388	2245849	Instagram park?
2246189	2246289	Yeah.
2246309	2246890	Yeah.
2247005	2252612	Pokemon Go Fest 2025 Max Finale is going to be coming soon.
2252632	2260002	It's going to take place August 23rd and 24th and will feature Max Pokemon including Eternatus.
2263526	2266330	Neat, I haven't been in Pokemon Go in a while.
2267575	2269638	Eternatus, I think, might be?
2269859	2271361	Eternatus, yeah.
2271381	2272944	Emprisonatus?
2272964	2274206	Empanadas?
2274646	2275167	Empanadas.
2275808	2276890	Yes, it's empanadas.
2279033	2283360	Anyways, well, that Pokemon is a pretty big one from Sword and Shield.
2283721	2287206	I still am playing Pokemon Go pretty regularly, at least to incentivize my walk.
2287246	2291253	I do mostly Bluetooth catching, but I'll catch the most random fucking shinies.
2291313	2293937	Like, just in the last week, I got a shiny Aeron.
2293917	2320600	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2321137	2329568	Pokemon Masters EX Pokemon Masters X Yes.
2329588	2331611	It's what everybody's wanted, I guess.
2332953	2345490	It is going to be getting Carmine and Sinestra as a sync pair on July 29th, or at least starting July 29th through September 6th.
2345791	2347794	So you'll be able to participate with that.
2349295	2352640	Let's see, Pokemon Cafe Remix.
2353100	2354782	DarkSakura, are you glitching?
2356444	2356725	Am I?
2357125	2359388	Are you disappearing into the Matrix?
2359408	2362472	I don't know, you keep blinking, which I'm like, what the hell is happening?
2362532	2362793	Sorry.
2362873	2363273	I don't know.
2363694	2368179	I'm actually looking at... Well, it stopped now.
2368259	2369982	Of course, now that I said something, it stopped.
2370482	2371283	So, whatever.
2371443	2372785	Anyway, go ahead, Loki.
2372805	2373486	Sorry.
2373803	2389280	It's a bunch of pirate-themed characters and cosmetics coming to the game Pokemon Cafe Remix, including Captain Outfits for Lapras, Lone Mouth, Toadtodile, and Messino.
2389300	2389541	Neat.
2389841	2393665	And they also have a summer-themed Jigglypuff.
2393866	2394426	Let's see, what else?
2395367	2396208	Pokemon Sleep!
2396929	2401414	Legendary beasts are coming to Pokemon Sleep, but you'll never see them because you'll be asleep.
2403925	2404526	It's coming out in August.
2404546	2406488	That's not how the game works, Loki.
2406508	2407369	That's not how the game works?
2407389	2408070	That's not how the game works.
2408090	2409832	I don't know anything about Pokemon Sleep.
2410152	2411533	It measures your sleep.
2411694	2416939	It's a game where you try to play Pokemon, but every time you bring out your Pokemon, they're asleep.
2416960	2418962	And you're just like, I don't know what to do here, man.
2419002	2421685	Like, do we fight now?
2421705	2422185	I don't know.
2422806	2425749	When that game first came out, I failed to see the point completely.
2425769	2428212	And then I played it for a little bit.
2428192	2451111	Pogo Plus Pokemon Unite Lataius
2451580	2453222	I don't know these Pokemon.
2453743	2455546	Yeah, join the roster.
2456587	2458630	That's going to be coming, I guess, August 8th.
2459271	2462375	And then they have a new battle mode called Electrode Volleyball.
2463577	2466681	And that's going to be, I guess, available now in the game as well.
2468383	2470326	More Pokemon TCG stuff.
2470446	2478938	They showed off some new full art Mega Evolution cards, including Lucario, Gardevoir...
2479880	2509633	Kangaskhan and Venusaur so cool there we have Pokemon Friends is going to be let's see Pokemon Friends which was released on the App Store it's getting a they're also a new puzzle game I guess called Pokemon Friends and I'm not really sure what it is it says you get plushies by solving short puzzles in a variety of classic traditional brain teaser formats
2510407	2538709	and I think that's the game you can do you can do one puzzle and then you gotta pay for it free to play free to play technically true um and then we had what was it Pokemon Scarlet and Violet talking about the Switch 2 upgrades for that as well as they're gonna be getting new terror raids for the Treasures of Ruin um
2539887	2543633	But you'll only be able to capture them after the raids have been completed 1 million times.
2544394	2546937	That's stupid.
2546957	2548760	A lot of stuff just makes you think it's stupid.
2550322	2554589	We have the first footage of Pokemon Champions, the battle simulator game.
2554689	2563482	It's going to include ranked, private battles, new training mode, and it's coming to Switch and Mobile 2026.
2565149	2593840	and then finally we got some more footage of Pokemon ZA Legends or Pokemon Legends ZA and yeah they showed off some gameplay on the Nintendo Switch too which thankfully doesn't look like ass so that's good it's gonna be it looks like fun I'm actually really hyped for this game I'm really excited to get it yeah and yeah games are supposed to be coming out October 16th that's gonna be here before we know it
2594326	2594827	Yep.
2594847	2595649	I'm sorry for that, though.
2595669	2596351	That's pretty much it.
2596371	2600401	I gotta say, yeah, I gotta say, I wasn't, like, blown away by this Pokemon Presents.
2600421	2606516	I mean, obviously, Legends Z through A is great, and so I know they gotta do a little bit of the hype machine for that, but I don't know.
2606536	2609584	I thought maybe there'd be something kinda new in it, or maybe...
2609564	2638052	I don't know, maybe I just set the bar too high in my mind I'm still really disappointed we don't really have decent ways to play the old Pokemon games considering the fact that Nintendo's really pivoted away from the 3DS and the DS and so those ports of Pokemon Yellow and all that stuff not that I need to necessarily play Pokemon Yellow again but it would be nice to have some of those older Pokemon games maybe in the Switch library maybe just to hear about some other games that are coming out for Switch 2
2638032	2655855	Yeah, yeah.
2657135	2677495	Jamie, you've talked plenty about Dear Esther.
2677535	2681299	That was another one of their titles as well, kind of the OG game in that genre.
2681439	2682400	Both, they were great.
2682380	2684765	Little Orpheus, another game they made.
2685045	2686007	I missed this one.
2686027	2688612	They made a game recently called Still Wakes the Deep.
2689574	2690636	I haven't checked that game out.
2690676	2692319	It looks very different from some of their other titles.
2692339	2696386	Yeah, I've not played this yet, so maybe I need to wake up.
2696407	2704101	But you may or may not know, the Chinese room at some point was acquired by Sumo Group.
2704081	2710957	and then Tencent bought Sumo in 2021 for $1.27 billion.
2710977	2716289	So this really was a case of fish gets eaten by bigger fish gets eaten by biggest fish.
2716870	2723305	Well, apparently what has happened is that the Chinese room has now bought back its independence.
2723285	2724487	Yay!
2724748	2741817	Yay!
2741797	2743981	which is the British way of saying that.
2744061	2747727	The specifics are confidential but the studio is currently 55 developers.
2748088	2752575	This was a very difficult process as we saw a future for the studio outside of Sumo.
2752595	2755640	No more layoffs are planned as the studio moves forward.
2755660	2756582	So that's...
2757187	2759030	I guess take that for what it's worth.
2759391	2760773	But they are going to be independent.
2761714	2767263	They are also working on Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines 2 in conjunction with Paradox.
2767844	2770428	That title is supposed to be launching in October.
2770448	2776478	They are also, they meaning the Chinese room, is developing two other games that are not yet announced.
2776458	2794103	In a quote on this whole thing, the studio ahead, Ed Daly, said, This management buyout allows us to scratch the creative itch of continuing to work on new, original intellectual property, but also to partner with other studios on projects when they fit in with our vision.
2794123	2799190	This is what we're doing, and we want to carry on doing it, so we're happy to carry on in this vein.
2799210	2804017	So kind of a mixed bag of news there is that, you know, hooray for the independents, but at what cost?
2804818	2806060	So it'll be...
2806040	2806781	It'll be interesting.
2806801	2809385	Questbuster points out Still Wakes the Deep was really good.
2809485	2810507	I don't know how I missed that.
2810787	2818099	I usually try to follow and see if that studio's got anything coming out, but I guess that just kind of missed my radar.
2818439	2819982	How'd that happen?
2820002	2821384	I must have been asleep.
2821404	2822165	I'll have to check that out.
2822225	2824309	Maybe I can find it.
2824489	2826131	When did that game actually come out?
2827494	2828715	That's the other kind of question I have.
2828755	2832942	How long have I been officially sleeping on this game?
2834170	2836815	Uh, 2024, it was released.
2836835	2839319	June 18th, it's about a year old at this point.
2839479	2841763	Interesting, I gotta get on that.
2841783	2843667	Windows, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.
2844147	2845790	It's a psychological horror game.
2847072	2849096	Hmm, sounds like fun.
2849116	2850158	Alright, let's move on.
2850178	2851420	DarkSakura, what do you got for us?
2852817	2872007	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2871987	2888081	The producer of the game, Lee Cocker, said that they were going to introduce Pokemon characters in Street Fighter, Mega Man, go in the Dragon Ball franchise, Metal Gear Solid, Legend of Zelda, some Sony and Microsoft properties.
2888641	2890183	But that never happened.
2890203	2891864	It was a licensing nightmare.
2893065	2894586	So they just stuck with what they had.
2897289	2901252	Always fun to hear about the stuff that got cut from games, as frustrating as it can be.
2902852	2905596	Yeah, but honestly, don't overcomplicate it.
2905616	2906097	You know what?
2906478	2907038	Keep it simple.
2907439	2907639	Yeah.
2909622	2913669	And building off of the old rivalry was a smart move, keeping it that way.
2913689	2914730	I mean, I'm just saying.
2914750	2915572	Just saying.
2915592	2915812	True.
2916293	2919598	Well, and then the whole 2020 Olympic Games kind of got screwed up anyway.
2919678	2921881	Orange right in chat says, Super Smash Olympics.
2922061	2922843	Yeah, kind of.
2922923	2924766	That's kind of what it was going towards, wasn't it?
2924786	2925687	That's funny.
2927253	2928515	Moving on.
2928776	2929276	Loki.
2930418	2931600	Complaining works, right?
2932462	2933263	Yeah, apparently.
2933423	2943079	So everybody was unhappy with the fact that, well, Nintendo kicked off this whole $80 brand new game thing.
2944021	2949750	And of course, you know, the next studio to announce that their game was going to be $80 was Nintendo.
2949730	2951713	Obsidian with the Outer Worlds 2.
2952354	2954356	And of course, everyone complained about it.
2954376	2956239	And now they've walked it back.
2956259	2969257	So they put out a social media post saying, Dear Galactic Citizens, we have received your SOS via skip drone and are about the pricing as an organization devoted to make sure that corporations do not go unfettered.
2969277	2976987	We here at Earth Dictorate have worked with Redacted to revise the price of Outer Worlds 2.
2976967	2980013	and essentially dropped it down to $69.99.
2980474	2983820	We'll call it $70 because that's what it is.
2984441	2986425	$70, yes, basically.
2987367	2993659	Along with that, we also have news that Call of Duty Black Ops 7 is also only going to be $70 and not...
2995259	2999062	The price point for the game itself will be $70.
2999203	3002425	Let's not kid ourselves that it's only going to be $70.
3002445	3008711	Your limited editions, your special editions, your early access editions.
3008811	3012274	Yeah, so $70 as well.
3012334	3024405	So for right now, they've walked it back and the price point of $70 that people didn't like before now is a little bit easier to digest, I guess, because it's not $80.
3025735	3046644	Yeah, this really seems like a case of the internet getting what it wants, which I think is very interesting because it seems to indicate that, I mean, I don't, the only logical reason I can see that they are retreating from this, not just from one game, but all of, because all those games are Microsoft first party at this point with everything Microsoft's acquired in the last five years.
3047085	3048587	All those games are Microsoft first party.
3049008	3055557	This shows that Microsoft is retreating from that $80, which indicates to me the only reason you do that, the pre-orders weren't pre-ordering.
3055537	3060583	People were pushing back and voting with your wallet actually worked.
3060603	3062686	Now, of course, we don't have the stats to back that up.
3062706	3065589	They're not going to say pre-orders are at an all-time low.
3065670	3072538	I mean, I guess we could investigate with some retail outlets out there, but we probably are not going to get the full story on the why.
3072919	3078085	But it would seem to indicate that people were not willing to pay $80 for a video game.
3078065	3102975	Most likely, yeah.
3102955	3105641	Most people got it as a pack-in for their Switch 2.
3106343	3116968	Yes, I realize it was still the number one selling game outside of that, but I think that is... Once again, I think that's limited by who buys a Switch 2 and then buys the game.
3117248	3118872	Who would be buying that separately unless you got...
3118852	3125580	People that were desperate to get that day one so they could play with their friends or just the status of it or otherwise.
3126000	3129344	I think at the end of the day, you can explain it a hundred different ways.
3129364	3132388	It's not an accurate barometer for the rest of the gaming industry.
3132929	3142480	I think the accurate check for Nintendo will be if they decide to price something else at $80 because they didn't do it with Donkey Kong Bonanza.
3142460	3155068	and good thing they didn't because Donkey Kong Bonanza is a pretty good game and I worry the only thing in that conversation would be the $80 price tag if it had been $80 because it's a good game but it isn't exactly anything...
3157107	3181731	Prime 4 at $80.
3181711	3187099	Actually, now that I'm thinking about it, I hope they don't because they're going to set that game up for failure.
3187119	3188300	A new Zelda game, yes.
3189342	3190123	Metroid, no.
3190383	3191885	ZA isn't at 80, right?
3191905	3197693	Because that was in the news recently because I think that surprised a lot of us that Pokemon ZA is not going to be 80, right?
3198194	3202420	Because that would be the game I would think they would do it with a mainline Pokemon game.
3202400	3221117	would make sense for them to try at $80 but again that's going to be the more accurate barometer of where the $80 price tag is going to be effective for Nintendo but very clearly the others are retreating for it which is not a good sign for Nintendo leaning into this for a future game of theirs.
3221857	3239629	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3239761	3256656	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3256636	3274628	Thank you for watching!
3274608	3277211	I mean, there's no need to be disrespectful about it.
3277551	3278813	Yeah, $80 price tag?
3278833	3279413	No, thank you.
3279494	3280875	I'll wait for a sale.
3280895	3289425	That's a very effective... Because I think for... And God, that's probably a true statement for a large percentage of people who don't buy games on day one anymore.
3289725	3293409	Because they know they're going to be on sale, on Game Pass, something.
3293429	3296793	There's going to be another way to acquire it for far less cheaper later on.
3297134	3302860	It's just for those fans that really want to be in there day one for whatever reason that are willing to... Which...
3302840	3304422	is me with a Final Fantasy game.
3304483	3305344	I'm willing to admit that.
3306025	3309430	And I'm sure we all have franchises we would do that sort of thing for.
3309450	3326296	But it's interesting to see what games boardrooms think are worth $80 that then people go back and say, no, this is not something I'm going to take a gamble on.
3326316	3330282	That's a whole other thing, too, is that there's no guarantee an $80 game is going to be good.
3330565	3336171	You know Ubisoft is itching to charge $80 for games and that's a whole other issue.
3336831	3338012	I mean, sure.
3338853	3345960	Because they're stupid and delusional and think that their games are AAA games and then they put out some pirate game that sucks.
3348062	3349484	It's just awful.
3351886	3358633	That did real well for your Assassin's Creed game that you delayed again because it wasn't up to snuff.
3358933	3359914	Come on.
3361025	3371961	If you can, if Rockstar Games came out and said, yeah, we're a quadruple A studio, I would be able to, you know, that would be something, you know, okay, maybe, yeah, okay, yeah, I'd get, I'd buy that.
3371981	3374324	But, like, Ubisoft, come on.
3374925	3376006	Come on, Ubisoft.
3376147	3376828	Look in the mirror.
3376868	3378590	Like, I mean, really?
3378610	3380493	You've made Far Cry how many times now?
3380593	3387523	And while I'm talking about Far Cry, I'm talking about every other game that you've made while Far Cry has existed has basically been Far Cry.
3387563	3389766	Like, how many times have you made Far Cry?
3389982	3390523	Too many.
3391544	3396010	I want to get to another comment in our chat room, kind of tying this back to the beginning of the show.
3396651	3401778	TigerClaw in chat at twitch.tv slash VOG Network says, do you think those bullying tactics will work against Visa?
3402219	3406124	Well, I mean, technically they sent out a general response.
3406985	3409328	No, I think it's going to take something bigger in that case.
3409489	3412192	I do think it is worth calling and voicing your opinion.
3412252	3414235	I think it tactfully...
3414215	3415717	It is worth calling and voicing.
3415737	3423449	And all of this has to be done tactfully because if you just give ammunition to the gamers or trash and they like nothing but trash file, then people are going to use that.
3423530	3424371	So don't be trash.
3424751	3430420	I don't think anybody listening to this show, I don't think needs to hear that, but maybe some of the people you know need to hear it.
3430701	3434266	That would be what I would think about that.
3434286	3442399	I do think, you know, Itch.io is not a very large publisher when all is said and done, or I should say storefront of games.
3442379	3444142	Steam kind of is though.
3446385	3453257	I bet if Steam said we are now only going to take payments through Venmo or something like that, I bet they would do well enough.
3453357	3455861	They could weather the storm for a bit.
3456121	3457383	I don't think they'll do that.
3457403	3458124	I don't think they will.
3458485	3465857	But I think they have a little bit more negotiating power when it comes to Visa and MasterCard to be able to say no.
3466498	3466598	Yeah.
3466578	3467599	It depends.
3467719	3489101	I think right now, because what the demands are from the payment processors is it's not impacting sales enough, but if they started saying, oh, we're going to crack down on all violent games, we've got to protect the children or something like that, where it would affect more of their library than they may have some pushback.
3489501	3493986	I don't think that they're going to just be like, oh, yeah, we're going to take off all the M-rated games off this platform.
3494860	3497443	No, no, they're not going to do that.
3497463	3498184	Right, right.
3498645	3514504	And I think the optics, if they do delist something that isn't really adult because of the whole thing I was talking about before with LGBTQ or other types of themes, I think the optics of that would be so bad for Valve that they can't have that happening to them.
3514524	3515545	That would be very, very bad.
3515565	3519010	So they have a little more leverage to push back against the payment processors.
3519350	3520952	When all is said and done,
3520932	3524997	Itch.io is, I guarantee you Itch.io is not a large organization.
3525578	3532507	I guarantee you Itch.io does not have a large legal staff ready to deal with these sorts of situations.
3533329	3538095	Valve probably has more, but you know who'd have a ton?
3538115	3538836	Microsoft.
3539517	3545965	So if they try to start to, you know, I mean, do this, but already the consoles are pretty limiting in what they offer.
3546046	3547908	The consoles don't list AO games.
3547968	3549370	You don't have adult games like that.
3549390	3550872	Yeah, so.
3551155	3556662	Yeah, Itch just does not have the staff to be able to push back against this at the end of the day.
3556783	3557704	They don't have a legal team.
3558244	3566035	So they are more looking at, in order for us to not have to hire a lawyer and stay solvent, how do we get around this?
3566496	3570561	And now the baby got thrown out with the bathwater, which I really hate that expression, but it applies here.
3570941	3572343	That's what happened with Itch.io.
3572944	3576509	And now they're going to have to backtrack.
3576529	3580074	But blame the organization that's starting all this shit.
3580094	3581095	They know what they're doing.
3582003	3606492	mm-hmm all right which is weird though like because how many people does that organization actually have why does one person complaining to payment processors cause I think they rallied a thousand I think they rallied a thousand okay but in 77,000 they're like oh well you know forget them but like a thousand people mad at us oh no like
3607619	3611786	What they should be doing is they should be like, listen, man, we're Visa.
3611986	3613088	You're a thousand people.
3613128	3617375	You mean nothing to us.
3617395	3618417	You're in Australia.
3618797	3620520	You don't even have the right time.
3620540	3621021	Come on.
3621822	3623084	Your seasons are backwards.
3623124	3624426	Your toilets swim the other way.
3624446	3626149	With all these 30-minute increments, huh?
3626249	3627211	I'm kidding.
3627231	3627672	I'm kidding.
3627752	3629134	We have folks that listen to Australia.
3629194	3629895	You all are great.
3630376	3632820	But you know this organization is nutso, too.
3632940	3634082	So, all right.
3634062	3635704	Moving on.
3635724	3638047	Let's talk about other things going on with Steam.
3638067	3649561	So the Steam client beta is testing a new design for the storefront, which is to try to make it a little easier to find games that you might be interested because this is the age-old problem, right?
3649921	3654687	Steam is so full of games, it is hard to find things that you might actually be interested in.
3654727	3661555	Discoverability is a problem on any storefront these days, whether it's mobile, Steam...
3661535	3664922	All of it is in the same boat.
3664943	3669011	So they're trying new things to see what might be able to break through with that.
3669032	3679695	So the latest beta update, instead of having a bunch of text links and menu buttons, this remodel will have everything into an organized menu at the top.
3679675	3685622	So what happens is that you will get, quote, easier access to the places Steam users most frequently visit.
3686163	3691690	A browse feature lets you go into games based on top sellers, new releases, or sales.
3692190	3704485	The recommendations will let you explore what Steam thinks you're going to be into based on the things that you've played, the things that you've acquired in your library, or even things that maybe communities that you're in have recommended.
3704465	3715623	The categories menu button will let you look at the top genres of games that you're playing and then give you tags that are kind of along those same lines to find similar games.
3716024	3720972	Things like Great on Steam Deck, Immersive Sim, Demos.
3720952	3723034	Adult Video Games.
3723134	3724235	No, I'm kidding.
3725016	3731322	Anyway, Steam will also show the most popular searches, your games that you've viewed, and top genres.
3731702	3736967	And there is a button for advanced search if you want to go through all the filters and tags and all of that.
3736987	3738629	None of these are new features.
3738649	3748798	It is just a way for them to reorganize the features that are already there to try to make the button bloat of the menu on Steam today a little less popular.
3748778	3749759	So that could be interesting.
3749779	3755163	Again, if you want to check that out, you could just opt into the Steam Client Beta and take a look at it for yourself.
3755224	3760508	But that will probably just be a matter of time before it shows up for everybody.
3761889	3762570	All right, moving on.
3762590	3763090	DarkSakura.
3765092	3769896	Well, for people, this is actually, I'm going to put this in the realm of better news.
3769916	3778043	I don't know if anyone is familiar with Project FX's, sorry, SideFX Project Elderwood.
3778411	3796507	is a sort of a demonstration of some of their rendering tools meant for creating video game assets, including in-game vegetation and scenery, all sorts of things like that, all procedural tools for generating these things.
3796968	3807017	So they have released their custom Houdini tools for use in
3806997	3810624	For anyone who will be interested in using it.
3814050	3821684	It's based off of a custom tool called Natsura, which is like a new tree plugin thing.
3821704	3827875	If I remember correctly, I do believe this is going to be for Unreal Engine 5.
3829002	3850335	but um but yeah i mean it is it is something you know you got to pay for licensing but um but it's a lot of assets and i know that we've got people um and actually the project elderwood files themselves are free um so you can get uh get that and see how everything is put together
3850315	3862152	But, yeah, I think that if anyone out there is into a little bit more higher end game design, this is something I'd say we're thinking about.
3864335	3864816	Interesting.
3865116	3874309	I mean, I don't make a lot of games, so it's hard for you to put that in that context, but I think it's neat that the accessibility and information, I guess, is out there for everybody.
3874469	3874970	That's pretty cool.
3876552	3877253	Yep, yep.
3878315	3878415	Cool.
3878581	3885891	If any of our designer friends out there are using stuff like this, let us know.
3886597	3914410	let's move on just a few more stories before we get to the classic game of the week but this is an interesting meeting of the minds collaboration of the century we had the developers of Claire Obscure Expedition 33 visiting Square Enix and visiting the Final Fantasy dev offices as well for an exchange of ideas so collaborating with them and
3915048	3918913	Does this mean that we'll get a turn-based Final Fantasy game in the future?
3919314	3919834	Hopefully.
3921116	3924841	Maybe we can have the Claire Obscure folks put out a Final Fantasy game.
3926243	3933612	I would jump to that conclusion, but it is very interesting.
3933632	3935875	I think it's very interesting that
3936226	3940152	with all the talk of this is what we want in our Final Fantasy.
3940432	3942095	This is what Final Fantasy should have been.
3942335	3944378	This is the direction that Final Fantasy should be going.
3944959	3953331	I think it's very interesting that they are meeting with them because it actually shows a willingness to listen on Square Enix's part.
3953732	3955655	That, to me, is the news.
3955675	3960462	Y'all need to stop with the jump into the, oh, they're going to collaborate, they're going to offer...
3960442	3963006	No, I mean, it's all wishful thinking.
3963026	3966270	I'm not saying that to you, Loki, but, you know, just the internet in general.
3966290	3970817	But, I think it's just a show that Square Enix is willing to listen.
3971638	3976505	Which, hey, in this day and age, is a gift.
3976525	3979129	Because there's a lot of people out there who don't want to listen.
3979309	3982694	They also visited Kojima Productions as well.
3983075	3983195	Oh.
3984777	3985478	Just kind of cool.
3985498	3985939	Interesting.
3986900	3988963	I wonder what they might be cooking up over there.
3989770	3998203	Alright, well, taking it back to a classic era in gaming, we have some news this week on a brand new Atari 2600+.
3999685	4007256	You might remember this was the retro console that came out last year, but the little, or maybe it was two years ago.
4007236	4008018	What is time?
4008078	4011364	Time is a construct that has lost all meaning.
4011385	4012246	Time is fleeting.
4012747	4013549	Yes, that's right.
4013569	4015533	Madness definitely takes its toll.
4015613	4023650	But the 2600 Plus, it was a classic console, but it would actually play your Atari 2600 cartridges.
4023670	4025734	And I believe it plays your 50...
4025714	4027055	200 and your 7800s.
4027095	4029097	It plays more as well.
4029658	4036604	Well, they're coming out with a new 2600 plus that is all about Pac-Man.
4036624	4037525	And I don't know.
4037725	4040528	I don't know if I love the look of this thing.
4040768	4045612	But for those that are listening live, you can take a look at what this looks like there.
4046333	4047274	It's like a yellow.
4047354	4047714	It's it.
4047734	4053459	Take that wooden concept of an Atari 2600 and make it yellow, which I just don't like.
4053600	4055061	I don't like the color.
4055081	4055181	Yeah.
4055161	4065593	Yeah, yeah.
4066467	4070733	I guess that might be neat for people that missed it the first time around, but I'm not sure.
4071214	4072255	I love the look of it.
4072576	4074959	But it is celebrating 45 years of Pac-Man.
4075240	4076642	It is coming out October 31st.
4076702	4082169	The price in British pounds is $128.09.
4084032	4086556	So I don't know what that's going to translate to over here.
4086576	4087237	Maybe $129.99?
4087878	4088318	We'll see.
4089380	4090922	It is...
4090902	4103463	Just the same as the basic model that came out previously, but it will have a Pac-Man themed joystick, also yellow, and a double feature Pac-Man Atari 7800 cartridge.
4103483	4114641	It has an all new arcade game, Pac-Man 7800, and it has the very first Pac-Man Atari 2600 as if anybody needs to revisit that.
4115062	4116184	No one wants to see that.
4116164	4120112	So, but that's kind of neat that it has both the reimagining.
4120373	4125944	There also are Ghost Edition wireless joysticks coming in the color of the various ghosts, which is kind of a cute idea.
4126626	4127427	But yeah, that's coming.
4127908	4129872	However, that's not really the news that caught my eye.
4130674	4133700	The news that did catch my eye was that Atari 50...
4133680	4142988	The retro collection that came out for the modern consoles a few years ago now at this point is getting yet more DLC.
4143329	4145751	This is after the Intellivision.
4145931	4147733	They had some other stuff recently.
4147753	4151096	Now they are getting a Namco Legendary Pack.
4151516	4154959	It's going to tell the story about Atari and Namco's partnership.
4155380	4160004	And yes, Pac-Man for the Atari 2600 will be in this collection.
4160464	4160884	Fine.
4161185	4162706	Where that game belongs?
4162726	4163687	In a museum.
4163667	4165811	A virtual museum.
4166311	4168495	The 2600 plus is $169.99.
4168515	4171500	Oh, thank you, tariffs.
4171700	4173203	In the U.S.
4173483	4174164	Thank you, tariffs.
4174485	4174765	Thanks.
4175226	4175507	All right.
4175807	4178431	Anyway, where were we?
4178451	4178672	Oh, yes.
4178692	4182759	The Atari 2600, 5200, 7800 will all be represented.
4182839	4186705	Galaga, Dig Dug, Xevious, Galaxian.
4186685	4189209	All going to be represented in this, which I think is really cool.
4189429	4192935	I love this idea of the Namco collaboration.
4193015	4211144	Of course, this leads to a lot of people, including myself, asking, could there be an Activision collaboration, which means a Microsoft collaboration, which I would think on the Xbox version of the game would be easy peasy, even though now there's their own Xbox Classics.
4211224	4213468	Well, I got to come back to that in a minute.
4214393	4217476	It would be neat to see Activision represented at some point.
4217576	4221000	I just think the licensing is going to make that very difficult.
4221020	4221901	But never say never.
4222942	4226046	After all, you can play a lot of those games now on Xbox Classics.
4226226	4227667	But I will say this.
4228168	4233414	Microsoft is doing a terrible job supporting that Xbox Classics.
4234855	4237198	Show of hands in the room, everybody.
4237218	4243945	How many of you know that the legendary game Gabriel Knight is now accessible on Xbox Classics?
4244870	4253445	and DarkSakura.com.
4254775	4255516	No.
4255536	4255796	Yeah.
4256057	4257419	Microsoft.
4257439	4259161	I don't have an Xbox that I would play it on.
4260162	4266591	Gabriel Knight was a classic CD-ROM game by Sierra that had Tim Curry as one of the voices.
4266611	4270316	I believe had some other A-list actors involved in that game as well.
4270897	4273120	Gabriel Knight released on Xbox Classics.
4273380	4281070	Unfortunately, the publicity and the system behind that is so bad, it's not getting any coverage that these games are actually.
4281090	4284715	So it seems like they're adding new games maybe once a month.
4284695	4302079	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4302059	4331526	and that was before Gabriel Knight that was the last one with Cosmic Commander and some of the other releases this or Cosmic Commuter this time I didn't bother looking and I was just like I'm sure they're probably not because I should have seen I should have seen this somewhere else than actually just logging into the game on a whim and seeing oh they added Gabriel Knight at some point to Xbox Classics nobody's talking about it for what a legendary fucking game that is from the 90s so anyway
4331506	4333268	That was my tangent.
4333288	4336191	But the classic talk isn't done yet, right, DarkSakura?
4336992	4338954	Let's go to the bump.
4349606	4356934	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
4357395	4360078	It's time for the classic game of the week.
4361712	4363074	Damn, Jamie, this game's old.
4364736	4366398	Yeah, it is.
4366418	4366858	This is an old game.
4368140	4375649	Well, I was specifically looking up vector games and I was like, oh yeah, this game existed and I haven't done it before.
4376370	4377571	So it's Omega Race.
4378813	4390707	It is a shooter that came out in 1981 designed by Ron Halliburton and it was released by Midway.
4390687	4398459	It was an arcade video game, and it was the only arcade vector graphic game that Midway created.
4399621	4400563	It had some ports.
4400583	4401865	We'll get into that for a bit.
4402806	4406312	But the way that the game is set is it's set in 2003!
4406672	4407193	Yeah!
4408523	4429232	and you control an Omegan fighter spaceship to destroy enemy droid ships around a track and you use a spinner to control the ship and you have a button to thrust and a button to fire lasers and so the enemies that you destroy
4430663	4441214	Have to destroy or avoid, this is different ones you have, are drone ships, commander ships, two types of space mines, and shooting star ships.
4441234	4447380	And you bounce off an invisible barrier on the edge of the screen that briefly shows up when you're hit.
4447641	4453366	And of course you get extra ships, they're awarded at 40,000 points and 100,000 points respectively, by default.
4454468	4454848	Um...
4455419	4458506	The port that came out... Alright, let me actually get into the port.
4458546	4464399	So it was ported to the VIC-20 in Commodore 64, published by Commodore in 1982.
4464459	4472196	In 1983, we had the ColecoVision and Atari 2600 versions that were released by CBS Electronics.
4472176	4486416	So the Atari 2600 version came with a booster grip controller that converted the button on the Atari CX-40 joystick into having separate buttons for thrusting and shooting.
4488138	4502098	It was also one of the few CBS games that came out on the 2600 that had an additional 256 bytes of RAM in each cartridge, and they called it RAM+.
4502078	4515394	The Consumer's Guide How to Win at Video Games stated that any unskilled player can pop a quarter into the machine and stay up there for up to 20,000 points.
4517696	4528609	They said that more than 35,000 machines were created and the average machine brings in $181 per week as of the publication in 1982.
4528589	4540049	And it was one of the best money-making machines at the time because it was deceptive and actually pretty frustrating.
4541912	4547121	Compute magazine called Omega Race, quote, a real winner for the VIC.
4547101	4549344	and that it was fast-paced.
4550005	4554651	Sorry, Byte Magazine said it was fast-paced, had colorful graphics and featured good sound effects.
4555371	4560858	The quote says Omega Race is a fun game that retains all the best characteristics of the arcade version.
4561559	4567367	Ahoy also called the VIC-20 version fairly faithful to the game and very exciting.
4567387	4574796	And it won a certificate of merit in the category Best Solitaire Computer Game at the 4th Annual ARKI Awards.
4574776	4580503	It was cloned for the TRS-80 Color Computer, a space race in 1982.
4581123	4583806	And now here's the fun one.
4584647	4592216	It was going to be... In fact, it was pitched for the Atari Jaguar as an update.
4592236	4594358	But it didn't get further than the proposal.
4596821	4599905	There's a document that exists about this.
4599925	4602808	It is in the hands of someone named...
4603463	4622755	Joe Corrale on Atariage and that's it that's Omega Race it's vector-tastic it is I'm trying to remember if I ever actually played this game because it does look super familiar I know I played this at some point but I'm like was it an actual arcade version or where I don't know
4623157	4624058	I don't know.
4624619	4626662	Actually, DarkTetsu just said what I was just thinking.
4627723	4633251	Could you imagine an updated multiplayer version of this sort of in the style of, say, Tempest 2000?
4633731	4636215	Ooh, that's kind of fun.
4636235	4637637	That's neat.
4637657	4639019	Alright, great classic.
4639039	4645407	And SSU100 Matt adds, apparently there was a sight-down version in the arcade that was rare.
4647810	4649232	Interesting.
4649252	4651155	But this game is math.
4652603	4655548	All right.
4656129	4657772	Yeah, definitely a classic pick there.
4657792	4660035	So thank you, DarkSakura, for that pick.
4660757	4660997	All right.
4661077	4665985	We're going to get to some other headlines right now in a segment called Rapid Fire News.
4666005	4668129	Talk about some other things going on.
4668229	4670072	Loki, why don't you start us off?
4670812	4678042	Alright, so starting things off, of course, we got some cool new games coming, homebrew games.
4678582	4687915	So Fallout Bakersfield, which is a Doom... I'm just imagining and it's making me laugh.
4688356	4690879	Is that a prequel or a sequel to Fallout Buttonwillow?
4691480	4692381	Just wondering.
4693677	4722621	it is a non-commercial Doom 1993 total conversion built using GZ Doom and it's being worked on currently right now it's estimated to be out in 2027 but it looks pretty impressive so far definitely has Fallout 1 and 2 vibes which I think is supposed to be around the time period that takes place but yeah, Fallout Bakersfield look forward to that something exciting needs to happen there
4723630	4742449	and then we got the announcement of and I knew we knew it was coming but they finally showed off the set now and you can pre-order it but the Lego Game Boy which is I think almost a one-to-one model it's gonna retail for $60 and
4742429	4756443	and it basically comes with some mock cartridges for Zelda and Super Mario Land and it also has lenticular little displays that you can slide in there but it looks really cool.
4756463	4757323	It does.
4758364	4760286	And it's coming out October 1st.
4761447	4765952	But yeah, it's actual size and actually not super expensive so that's pretty good.
4766152	4767934	It's 60 bucks, that's not bad.
4768374	4770837	It's really not.
4770857	4772318	Alright, DarkSakura.

4839983	4844577	Dreamlocked SRA

4852773	4854595	So, yeah.
4855056	4857259	The Population Must Grow, which is a city builder.
4857339	4858641	Rob, that sounds like something up your alley.
4859061	4859943	Interesting.
4861244	4867653	There's a game called A Pig Game, a Pee Wee premiere, and you play as a ceramic pig looking for toothpicks.
4867733	4868655	It's so cute.
4869436	4873922	And then Simple Zombie Survival, which looks like a PS1 game.
4875218	4876320	All right.
4877501	4880606	Going to updates to the Nintendo Music app.
4880666	4885192	Nintendo Music got a pretty big drop of songs this week.
4885212	4889798	It's 26 new games from the NES and Famicom era.
4889818	4894425	I won't name them all, but essentially it's all of the black box release titles.
4894605	4901074	You know, things from like Clue Clue Land, Excitebike, Ice Climber, you know, sort of that initial launch era of games released.
4901054	4928682	Famicom, Mahjong, Gomoku, Narabe, Renju Devil World
4928662	4933026	and turning them into 10-hour loops, which is something you can do in the Nintendo Music app.
4933507	4945899	So if you want to go slowly crazy by listening to the Clu Clu Land background music over and over and over and over again while you work, you can do that thanks to your Nintendo Music app.
4947120	4954107	All right, now let's check out some release dates of some games coming out all these years later after the Famicom's release.

5135637	5136939	It would get more attention, wouldn't it?

5148494	5152419	I think that's everywhere, because that is in like four different editions in Japan.

5183545	5183666	Uh-oh.
5183766	5184327	Oh, interesting.
5184347	5191196	Remari says Journey to Kyoto got delisted because Dispatch is a fucking disgrace to game localization.
5191537	5194721	They took people's limited print pre-order money and ran.
5195262	5195863	Really?
5196965	5197645	Oh, wow.
5199488	5200490	That sounds like drama.
5201571	5205056	See, maybe we do need the release of the... Yeah, fuck yeah, Train Sim!
5206438	5211405	But see, then payment processors wouldn't want to let people buy my game, so what can I do?
5213343	5238523	All right, let's go to the UK, DarkSakura.
5238503	5264764	Madomonogatari, Thea and the Wondrous Academy for PlayStation and Switch, on the 30th, Terminal Brigade, T-E-R-M-I-N-U-L-L, Earthian for Switch PlayStation Xboxes, on the 31st, Gold Gold Adventure Gold for PC, Atomic Owl for PC, Hell Galaxy for PC, and Hungry Meme, M-E-E-M.

5281571	5288001	I don't think I said that Or was it the Madomonogatari?
5291002	5292506	Sorry, Ranma asked.
5292546	5293610	I should have said something.
5293630	5296037	No, it's fine.
5296057	5296979	Well, we'll look it up later.
5298002	5299045	All right.
5299065	5303037	Loki, we'll go to you for one more story before we go to Listener Roundtable.
5303776	5317656	Yeah, so we have news now that apparently Station Eleven, their showrunner, is going to be leading the upcoming live-action series based on Wolfenstein.
5317816	5327269	So the director of Fallout, because Fallout's done so well for itself, it's already garnered a second and now third season.
5327249	5329332	But now they're like, hey, you know what?
5329352	5330154	Fallout worked out.
5330174	5331516	Let's do Wolfenstein.
5331536	5334580	And so now that's going to be a thing that's being worked on as well.
5335482	5337705	So we'll have to see how this turns out.
5337725	5338747	But I'm excited.
5338787	5339929	Fallout was great.
5339949	5341111	I can't wait for the season two.
5341471	5343274	I think that's later this year, actually.
5343294	5345037	Yeah, lots of stuff happening on the TV front.
5346038	5347080	I have to say something real quick.
5347140	5351687	Madomodogatari, I should have known because it's the game that PioPio was based off of.
5352089	5354254	Oh, interesting.
5355176	5355397	Okay.
5355918	5357983	Yeah, and I'm a silly bean.
5358003	5358825	I should have remembered that.
5360248	5360569	Alright.
5361912	5364378	Well, don't let us get four of you in a row or you'll disappear.
5366302	5366723	Um...
5370280	5372704	It's been a hot minute since I played some Puyo Puyo.
5372724	5373326	I should play it again.
5373346	5378976	I know they have the Puyo Puyo in Tetris 2 on Switch 2 because that was very controversial because it's not a free upgrade.
5379276	5382001	But I didn't own it on Switch 1, so, you know, whatever.
5382723	5383023	We'll see.
5383043	5386770	You realize that right now I am literally looking at a Super Famicom copy of it.
5387543	5400962	Curbys Avalanche
5402512	5402993	I do love that game.
5403013	5404416	You know what Puyo Da was, right?
5404556	5408384	It was the dancing music game that came out on Dreamcast.
5408684	5409286	Yeah.
5409306	5410107	I thought it was cute.
5410368	5411650	It was cute.
5411670	5412732	Wispy Woods.
5413133	5417983	That was how they said it in Kirby's Avalanche.
5418003	5418985	That's how they said it.
5418965	5420507	Wispy Woods.
5420607	5426656	Let's get to the Lister Roundtable and invite you to do your Kirby impressions here on the show.
5426756	5431162	If you want to call us, you sure can on our Discord, vognetwork.com.
5431663	5439454	By the way, new feature on the VOG Network Discord server, we now have one of them cute little tags you can have by your name.
5439434	5440877	Yes.
5441118	5455570	Yes.
5455550	5476478	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5476458	5477680	So check that out.
5477700	5477920	Yeah.
5478241	5481306	Bobby says Rob's boost goes towards cleaner voice chat rooms.
5481366	5481967	That is true.
5482067	5484651	The original two went to having us as actual.
5485172	5492363	And this whole little getup is a little bit cleaner and has better audio thanks to... I haven't seen a single cobweb.
5492644	5493505	Yeah.
5493986	5496610	It's the one thing I do keep clean, unlike the mailbox.
5496590	5499702	Speaking of which, do we have an email this week?
5499722	5499782	No.
5499802	5500866	I didn't see any, but okay.
5501248	5508034	Participate at OrangeSongsRadio.com if you wish to throw some things at Jamie to read in a future week.
5508858	5529938	or if you want to keep sending me promo codes some of y'all are so nice and send me promo codes keep it up keep up the yes keep up the good work send Rob promo codes I'm very interested in free shit in Pokemon Go if you get any codes for that or you know any any good game I'll probably take them I appreciate it
5529918	5537011	Um, how about any, oh yeah, S. Jonah Matt says, don't throw any actual things at Jamie unless they are tacos.
5537412	5539897	And even then I would recommend a soft shell.
5540498	5545607	Or a Garris Vicarian body pillow.
5545627	5548753	What, you know, one of my friends had a birthday this last week.
5549172	5552737	It might have been the same birthday as the Bobby Blackwolf show, actually, now that I think about it.
5552757	5554699	But anyway, one of my friends had a birthday this weekend.
5554719	5561468	He was texting me pictures today from the Mass Effect ride at Great America.
5561528	5562950	He went to Great America for his birthday.
5563551	5564672	You need to go!
5564712	5568517	I was like, I keep forgetting the Mass Effect ride exists, right?
5568537	5570460	Because you would have thought they would have closed it years ago.
5570840	5578470	But what caught my eye is that I was looking at the pictures and I was noticing that the host...
5579260	5583125	Did not appear to be a guy.
5583145	5585868	So that's not... What's his name?
5585908	5590454	The fanboy from Mass Effect that usually is the mascot on the ride.
5590734	5594519	Yeah, usually the person introduces themselves as Conrad.
5594539	5597062	And it's a joke to the games.
5597343	5599125	But I've never seen...
5599662	5603046	A lady or theydy hosting the ride.
5603246	5604488	So I don't know.
5604808	5607051	But it does look like this picture is so far back.
5607091	5610535	But now that I'm looking at it, they might have green skin.
5611015	5614799	So I'm wondering... I'm wondering if it's just weird lighting.
5614820	5618344	The sorry lady that turned green from the Dorian?
5618644	5619765	I wonder if it's that.
5619785	5620306	What was her name?
5620566	5621507	Because I asked.
5621527	5622729	I said, wait a minute.
5622829	5624591	Who did she introduce herself as?
5624651	5626012	Because that's not Conrad.
5626353	5628235	That's the first time I've seen...
5629109	5631416	A different gender up front.
5631436	5635127	So I was like, what did he couldn't remember?
5635990	5636531	Shiala.
5636812	5637454	That was her name.
5638537	5639580	Oh, I wonder.
5639721	5643793	I wonder if that's like the the other character they can have.
5645208	5662928	Sorry, very random, but just a reminder to those, if you go through the Bay Area, you have maybe, I don't know, they're saying, they're threatening like two years left to go check out that ride before they close Great America forever and turn it into condos because billionaires are terrible people.
5664170	5664891	I want a taco now.
5664911	5668955	Except for Dolly Parton, who might not actually be a billionaire.
5669055	5669436	I'm not sure.
5669456	5670557	Is Dolly Parton a billionaire?
5671482	5674205	I'm sure, but I mean... She's excluded.
5674245	5679290	There's some ethical people out there, but she also does a lot of good with her money.
5679310	5684775	When the billionaires... She's just a billionaire with karma.
5685676	5690521	There's a few other folks out there who use their money for good.
5691762	5695566	To be fair, Bill Gates does a lot of good stuff with his money.
5695706	5696367	More than most.
5697128	5698469	That's on Trey Parker.
5699330	5699430	Yeah.
5703764	5704985	Okay, $500 million.
5705246	5708469	Still, that's probably because she's giving away a bunch of money.
5708969	5715816	The funniest thing about that South Park was before that little AI thing was shown, and y'all know what I'm talking about.
5716417	5718339	It said one of 50.
5718519	5719881	Of 50, yeah.
5719901	5728169	And they renewed for 50 episodes, which makes me think they're gonna do this shit every single week.
5729330	5729991	Which...
5731355	5739772	I never thought I would be sitting here going, South Park is really funny, but everything from the 90s is back, I guess.
5741816	5748390	And of course, then people want to say, oh, well, South Park only wasn't funny because they were making fun of liberals.
5748410	5750674	South Park has always made fun of everybody.
5750694	5753059	It just got to a point where it was like...
5753039	5754162	I don't know, it was just so much.
5754242	5759414	But now they're making fun of the Republican bros.
5759575	5761339	They don't like it anymore.
5761479	5765409	They're pushing an envelope that hasn't really been pushed in a long time.
5766190	5767453	It needs to happen.
5768356	5769799	I'm hoping for an aneurysm.
5772766	5785211	I didn't say who, I didn't say when, I didn't say anything.
5785973	5789560	I'm just hoping for an aneurysm.
5789540	5791322	I don't have a joke about that.
5791722	5792503	He was pretty metal.
5792563	5796728	And then Ozzy Osbourne, of course, Malcolm Jamal Warner passed away.
5796748	5799932	And I said, you know, these death things, they usually come in threes.
5800152	5802495	So I think for a minute there, we were all thinking.
5802515	5804036	I said, no, I don't have to say the name.
5804317	5805458	I don't have to say anything.
5806159	5808381	And of course, the room's laughing, giggle, giggle, giggle.
5809042	5815569	And then I said, and then we all realized we need to be more specific because God took the wrong racist.
5815970	5816070	Yeah.
5820404	5823028	Anyway, moving on.
5823288	5828955	And then I believe I ended that joke with, and if that joke is too soon for you, too bad, brother.
5830277	5830598	All right.
5831078	5836966	Yeah, and DT also points out that the Ozzy concert with Black Sabbath raised a lot of money for charity, and yes.
5837367	5838849	It did, yeah.
5839810	5841092	I'm not going to joke about Ozzy.
5841452	5845578	And I think it's metal as fuck that the first thing Ozzy does when he dies is murder Hulk Hogan.
5845698	5847981	Like, this is so metal.
5849075	5857645	I'm going to go back and say another thing, because I actually said the same thing about when my dad passed, is that it's all something that he brought on himself.
5860067	5867976	Well, for my dad, it was lots and lots of drugs and alcohol when he was younger, and probably for Hogan, it was very similar, compounded with roids.
5867996	5868957	You know?
5868997	5870819	Still taking them.
5871320	5873142	Rough week to have done cocaine in the 80s.
5873542	5874023	Rough week.
5875124	5876145	Yep, yep, yep.
5878032	5883314	Anyway, let's see.
5883334	5886608	I was going to ask if we had any last minute stories, Loki.
5887043	5888384	Sure, we do.
5889265	5896351	Sony is hiring a new role, which is the Senior Director of Multi-Platform and Account Management.
5896371	5898293	What does that job do, you may ask?
5899434	5917050	They specifically say that it will play a critical leadership role in shaping and executing the global commercial strategy for PlayStation Studios software titles across all digital platforms beyond PlayStation hardware, including Steam, Epic Game Store, Xbox, Nintendo, and mobile.
5917030	5921775	Oh my god, the games are not going to be platform specific anymore.
5921935	5923257	Oh, the world's coming to an end.
5924979	5928963	I mean, yeah, obviously they're going to try doing that and pivot that way because they can make more money.
5930445	5931846	So, too bad, fanboys.
5934669	5935510	Alright.
5935530	5937452	Anything else?
5937472	5944540	Yeah, if you enjoyed the game that had behind me during this live stream, which is Boltgun, I have a free key for you because unfortunately they
5944942	5950911	You pick it up and then all of a sudden it becomes part of a bundle that you get.
5951733	5952314	Free key.
5952334	5953916	Free Steam key for Boltgun.
5953976	5954577	It's a great game.
5954657	5955499	Well, that looks fun.
5955779	5956120	All right.
5956140	5960707	Well, holler out in chat if you're the one to redeem it so we know it got redeemed.
5960727	5969160	So if you want more instant freebies like that, check out live as we broadcast Sunday nights, 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific.
5969140	5972723	Well, with that, I think we're going to move to wrap it up for the night.
5973204	5975025	So we're going to go around and get final thoughts.
5975065	5977187	But first, I want to thank you for listening to Orange Launch Radio.
5977548	5979569	Thank you for checking out our show.
5979589	5982472	We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.
5982792	5986716	So tell a friend or two about the show, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
5987597	5993182	If you liked what you heard, a nice five-star review on a site like Apple Podcasts, YouTube, Spotify, wherever it is you found this show.
5993202	5995484	It goes an awful long way, and we really appreciate it.
5996465	5999147	With that, we'll get everybody's final thoughts.
5999127	6000569	DarkSakura, we'll go to you.
6001110	6002953	I think you're streaming tonight, yes?
6004595	6008821	I am, I am, and I'm trying to get my stupid avatar hands to make a heart.
6009182	6010443	We'll just do this one instead.
6011966	6012366	There we go.
6012927	6015991	So, at any rate... Congrats, OrangeRite, got the code.
6016632	6017233	Congrats.
6017253	6019136	Okay, congratulations.
6019276	6026486	I'm going to be playing Mass Effect 2, and I've got some announcements to make, so, you know, stick around.
6027248	6027548	Um...
6027983	6038240	But I am going to be working out when I can actually throw in another ballet class and still keep my stream schedule.
6039122	6039823	I'm stupid.
6043308	6044050	All right.
6045292	6046233	I will see you next time.
6046253	6047495	Have fun, everybody.
6047515	6047776	All right.
6047796	6048116	Bye-bye.
6049098	6049819	Bye.
6050801	6052063	Loki, that takes us to you then.
6052083	6053265	Your final thought tonight.
6053718	6056201	Well, if you didn't get a key, it is half off right now on Steam as well.
6056361	6058123	So, just letting you know.
6058143	6059645	You can pick it up for $10.99.
6061587	6068175	My final thought is, hopefully I can get to finishing my data pack this week.
6068355	6069537	I've been saying that every week.
6069557	6073581	It's been taking a very long time, but it is a very complex thing that I'm doing for the first time.
6073601	6078127	So, that'll be... Yeah, it's going to be tricky.
6078147	6079829	So, I'm looking forward to getting that done.
6079869	6081270	It's going to be fun.
6081691	6082712	Make good content.
6083722	6089169	My final thought is Alan is going to be out of town for like four days for work.
6089569	6091632	So good thing Oreo likes to cuddle.
6091932	6094275	I love my cats.
6094295	6094635	All right.
6095056	6097599	That's going to do it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.
6097619	6098200	Thank you so much.
6098240	6100042	We'll be back next week to do it all over again.
6100502	6101464	Until then, good night.
