00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:36,113
[SPEAKER_10]: ... ... ... ...

2
00:00:39,637 --> 00:00:42,100
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

3
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,184
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

4
00:00:46,204 --> 00:00:47,986
[SPEAKER_07]: It is Orange Lawns Radio.

5
00:00:48,026 --> 00:00:48,726
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I'm laughing.

6
00:00:48,746 --> 00:00:49,727
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll explain myself in a minute.

7
00:00:50,248 --> 00:01:01,139
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, we're live and I'm here, myself, Rob Roberts, joined by my incredible co-host tonight, July 27th, 2025, for episode number 1056 of our show.

8
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:04,142
[SPEAKER_07]: First off, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

9
00:01:04,797 --> 00:01:26,721
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

10
00:01:26,701 --> 00:01:29,810
[SPEAKER_07]: We were talking about his drive because, you know, he's recording on the road right now.

11
00:01:30,612 --> 00:01:35,526
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was talking about the town of Winnemucca, Nevada as a place to stop.

12
00:01:35,947 --> 00:01:39,597
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess I was saying things about – and Alan at some point just went –

13
00:01:39,982 --> 00:01:41,424
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop saying that.

14
00:01:41,444 --> 00:01:45,309
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, you can't stand the sound of the name of that town.

15
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:51,878
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I was like, oh, yeah, I once had to stop there because I had to have Porta Subs, which is an amazing Nevada sandwich chain.

16
00:01:51,938 --> 00:01:54,922
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's on the way to Boise when I was going to see friends there and all this stuff.

17
00:01:54,982 --> 00:01:56,344
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's just the way Alan was.

18
00:01:56,364 --> 00:01:59,668
[SPEAKER_07]: So now it's become a joke between Jason and I. So he sent me a picture.

19
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:00,389
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really funny.

20
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:06,097
[SPEAKER_07]: He sent me a picture from a casino in Winnemucca where the sign just, like, brightly is lit up.

21
00:02:06,117 --> 00:02:06,778
[SPEAKER_07]: It says Winnemucca.

22
00:02:06,798 --> 00:02:07,879
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's just making this...

23
00:02:08,905 --> 00:02:32,837
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

24
00:02:32,817 --> 00:02:47,130
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they all can't be Sly Dell, Louisiana.

25
00:02:48,967 --> 00:02:51,770
[SPEAKER_04]: At least Fly Adele has a Waffle House and some trees.

26
00:02:52,731 --> 00:02:56,215
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think there are any Waffle Houses in Nevada.

27
00:02:56,235 --> 00:02:57,056
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think there are.

28
00:02:57,076 --> 00:02:57,556
[SPEAKER_05]: There are not.

29
00:02:57,576 --> 00:02:58,257
[SPEAKER_05]: There's not in Vegas.

30
00:02:58,277 --> 00:02:59,278
[SPEAKER_05]: There's not in Arizona.

31
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:01,040
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Arizona, but not Nevada.

32
00:03:01,841 --> 00:03:09,349
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, the furthest west I have eaten at a Waffle House was, I think, St.

33
00:03:09,449 --> 00:03:09,809
[SPEAKER_05]: Louis.

34
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, the first Waffle House I ever went to was in Tucson.

35
00:03:14,988 --> 00:03:15,949
[SPEAKER_07]: Or was it the second?

36
00:03:16,089 --> 00:03:18,873
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe Atlanta did beat it.

37
00:03:18,953 --> 00:03:25,101
[SPEAKER_05]: I literally do not know the first Waffle House that I went to because I probably could not form proper memories at that time.

38
00:03:26,283 --> 00:03:27,244
[SPEAKER_07]: That's funny.

39
00:03:27,264 --> 00:03:30,929
[SPEAKER_07]: I know the first Waffle House Alan went to was in Tucson.

40
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:36,396
[SPEAKER_07]: But maybe I did go at one point in the DragonCon years before I actually was at the Tucson one.

41
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:37,958
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, who cares?

42
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:38,519
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a Waffle House.

43
00:03:38,539 --> 00:03:44,187
[SPEAKER_05]: You know when you go to a Waffle House when you're out there, you have to go behind the counter and order me some grits.

44
00:03:44,207 --> 00:03:44,387
Ha ha ha!

45
00:03:44,367 --> 00:03:45,391
[SPEAKER_05]: A Bag of Grits.

46
00:03:45,411 --> 00:03:47,078
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, it's the thing you miss most.

47
00:03:47,179 --> 00:03:49,770
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a dollar.

48
00:03:50,151 --> 00:03:51,778
[SPEAKER_07]: How long does A Bag of Grits last you?

49
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,582
[SPEAKER_05]: It depends.

50
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:58,906
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't finished my last one and I got it a couple months ago.

51
00:03:59,166 --> 00:03:59,687
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, there you go.

52
00:03:59,967 --> 00:04:02,069
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to make sure that it's okay.

53
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:09,017
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little bit hard to do their grits at home because they're saltier when I make them for some reason and I don't add salt.

54
00:04:09,938 --> 00:04:17,646
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think, I don't know, but I freaking love good... I mean, these are like instant grits almost.

55
00:04:17,686 --> 00:04:22,491
[SPEAKER_05]: They're really quick and very fluffy and dense and delicious.

56
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:32,847
[SPEAKER_07]: So since we're Orange Lounge Foodio a little bit, I will say this because, you know, when you're from California and you say we don't have Waffle House here, it's like, oh, well, we have Denny's.

57
00:04:32,887 --> 00:04:33,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we do.

58
00:04:33,508 --> 00:04:34,730
[SPEAKER_05]: I went to that one downtown.

59
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:35,872
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's not Waffle House.

60
00:04:35,992 --> 00:04:36,513
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's not.

61
00:04:36,533 --> 00:04:38,857
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we have Waffle House knockoffs or Denny's.

62
00:04:39,398 --> 00:04:41,441
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's why we don't have Waffle House here.

63
00:04:41,501 --> 00:04:42,082
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Loki.

64
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:42,523
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you?

65
00:04:42,543 --> 00:04:44,186
[SPEAKER_07]: Tech Master Loki wants to talk about food.

66
00:04:44,226 --> 00:04:45,087
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Loki.

67
00:04:45,067 --> 00:04:46,149
[SPEAKER_07]: Blue.

68
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:48,252
[SPEAKER_07]: No, they have like Waffle Squares and things like that.

69
00:04:48,272 --> 00:04:49,194
[SPEAKER_07]: They're all knockoffs.

70
00:04:49,214 --> 00:04:54,423
[SPEAKER_07]: They're all knockoffs of what... But the actual Waffle House chain will not play with our wage laws.

71
00:04:54,463 --> 00:04:55,425
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why they won't build them here.

72
00:04:57,148 --> 00:04:59,992
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I heard that directly from a franchisor.

73
00:05:01,094 --> 00:05:02,477
[SPEAKER_07]: People say, well, you have Denny's.

74
00:05:02,497 --> 00:05:05,542
[SPEAKER_07]: And Denny's is everywhere here in California.

75
00:05:05,602 --> 00:05:07,345
[SPEAKER_07]: But here's my take.

76
00:05:07,325 --> 00:05:15,542
[SPEAKER_07]: You're sleeping on what I think is the better West Coast cafe, diner type of place, and that's Black Bear Diner.

77
00:05:15,562 --> 00:05:22,175
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's the place that I would much rather go there than Denny's any day of the week.

78
00:05:22,195 --> 00:05:23,538
[SPEAKER_07]: It's marginally better.

79
00:05:23,638 --> 00:05:26,143
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the thing I think people on the East Coast are missing.

80
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:38,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Black Bear was kind of like what we would do for... I would go with Danielle's family, part of my ballet group, because we never wanted to go to Chevy's.

81
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:42,077
[SPEAKER_05]: And we would always go to Black Bear, although this time we went to Red Robin after Swan Lake.

82
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:48,748
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's just like comfort food, and they have decent mimosas, and they will give you the bottle.

83
00:05:50,732 --> 00:05:50,832
Yeah.

84
00:05:51,638 --> 00:06:01,595
[SPEAKER_05]: and, yeah, but I still, like, if you, you know, could teleport me into any one of those, I would always choose the Waffle House first.

85
00:06:01,615 --> 00:06:02,657
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess, I guess.

86
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:06,884
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, Rama in chat says, hey, hey, Japanese Denny's is amazing.

87
00:06:06,964 --> 00:06:11,933
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, you can't compare international versions to American versions because they're never the same.

88
00:06:11,993 --> 00:06:14,096
[SPEAKER_07]: And that goes, that's good and bad.

89
00:06:14,117 --> 00:06:15,639
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm sure Japanese Denny's is better.

90
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:17,342
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, they also have, like,

91
00:06:17,322 --> 00:06:32,715
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw an article on that today Finally

92
00:06:32,695 --> 00:06:38,142
[SPEAKER_02]: There's almost no Sears left, but yeah, I think that one is also closing.

93
00:06:38,222 --> 00:06:43,989
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to say there's something like 90 of them in Mexico, but it's because it's not the same thing.

94
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:49,957
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Woolworths is still a thing in some countries, but not here.

95
00:06:50,097 --> 00:06:58,247
[SPEAKER_05]: Woolworths overseas was quite a bit different than the Woolworths here, and we had a Woolworths in Mobile, Florida.

96
00:06:58,227 --> 00:07:00,899
[SPEAKER_05]: All the way up through when I was in high school.

97
00:07:00,939 --> 00:07:05,439
[SPEAKER_05]: But I remember Woolworths also had a little lunch counter or something.

98
00:07:06,021 --> 00:07:06,162
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm-hmm.

99
00:07:06,952 --> 00:07:26,406
[SPEAKER_07]: Target in Australia is also a bit different.

100
00:07:26,767 --> 00:07:30,774
[SPEAKER_07]: So tell me one thing.

101
00:07:30,914 --> 00:07:31,575
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm.

102
00:07:31,724 --> 00:07:32,988
[SPEAKER_05]: This is going way back.

103
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:37,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you remember when Howard Johnson's had an ice cream parlor?

104
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,784
[SPEAKER_07]: Not the Hojo's.

105
00:07:38,804 --> 00:07:39,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my God.

106
00:07:39,706 --> 00:07:44,500
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember the ones here ever having them.

107
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Not in the inns.

108
00:07:45,162 --> 00:07:47,488
[SPEAKER_07]: You mean like a standalone ice cream parlor?

109
00:07:48,177 --> 00:07:49,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

110
00:07:49,459 --> 00:08:01,798
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know that I ever saw one out here, because it used to be all about the thrifty ice cream counter at the thrifty drugstore, which became the Rite Aid drugstore, which became the Walgreens drugstore, which I think are going out of business.

111
00:08:01,818 --> 00:08:06,586
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if there's any thrifty ice cream counters left, but that used to be the big ice cream thing.

112
00:08:06,606 --> 00:08:11,974
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a sign for one in the Folsom one, but I don't know if that's...

113
00:08:12,393 --> 00:08:13,054
[SPEAKER_02]: Still the case.

114
00:08:13,414 --> 00:08:20,402
[SPEAKER_02]: The last time I went into one, which was in Citrus Heights, which is closed now, they did have an ice cream counter, but no one was there.

115
00:08:20,922 --> 00:08:22,244
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know.

116
00:08:22,704 --> 00:08:24,646
[SPEAKER_07]: The one in Pocket had one, too.

117
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:26,849
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if that's still open or not, but I used to go there.

118
00:08:27,109 --> 00:08:34,297
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that the Howard Johnson and Mobile had one all the way up through the 80s, and I think it finally closed out like right before the 90s.

119
00:08:34,337 --> 00:08:36,159
[SPEAKER_05]: But they had like a peppermint stick flavor.

120
00:08:36,239 --> 00:08:39,042
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, wait, because Howard Johnson's is actually a restaurant, isn't it?

121
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:43,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Howard Johnson was their restaurant, but they were primarily, their ice cream was the big thing.

122
00:08:44,596 --> 00:08:45,957
[SPEAKER_07]: I associate that name with a hotel.

123
00:08:46,658 --> 00:08:48,640
[SPEAKER_07]: That's, like, there's one by Disneyland, right?

124
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,641
[SPEAKER_07]: Or there was, yeah.

125
00:08:50,161 --> 00:08:58,149
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and it's the same company in general, but they had, like, their big thing was 28 flavors of ice cream, and that was their thing.

126
00:08:58,189 --> 00:08:59,651
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what that makes me think of?

127
00:09:00,232 --> 00:09:02,214
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, we do talk about video games, I promise.

128
00:09:02,634 --> 00:09:06,598
[SPEAKER_07]: Fry's Electronics and Fry's Groceries.

129
00:09:07,304 --> 00:09:09,388
[SPEAKER_04]: We're like... Okay, I never knew Fry's Groceries.

130
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:12,914
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, because I want to say that's a thing in Arizona, is Fry's Groceries.

131
00:09:12,934 --> 00:09:14,256
[SPEAKER_07]: It was in the Bay Area, too.

132
00:09:14,276 --> 00:09:15,278
[SPEAKER_07]: It was in the Bay Area, too?

133
00:09:15,298 --> 00:09:16,220
[SPEAKER_07]: See, and now Fry's Electronics.

134
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,626
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if Fry's Groceries is still there, but obviously Fry's Electronics isn't.

135
00:09:20,607 --> 00:09:22,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, I'm going to take that back.

136
00:09:22,371 --> 00:09:26,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Fry's... I remember we had a Fry's in Antioch, California.

137
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:27,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

138
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:57,915
[SPEAKER_07]: and I can't remember if that one was also fries in San Jose one of those used to be in Alpha Beta and then it became a fries actually I have seen a fries grocery when my mom lived in Phoenix so yeah that's the other thing that comes to mind when I think of like a name that was in multiple things yeah so anyway alright just bring me back some Puddin' Pops they're probably all Kroger anyways I mean it's everything's Kroger

139
00:09:58,705 --> 00:10:02,549
[SPEAKER_05]: and open a Whataburger around the corner from my house and I'll be happy.

140
00:10:02,709 --> 00:10:04,771
[SPEAKER_07]: Whataburger or Waterburger?

141
00:10:06,112 --> 00:10:06,953
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Whataburger.

142
00:10:07,353 --> 00:10:09,975
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm all southern right now, Rob.

143
00:10:10,115 --> 00:10:12,297
[SPEAKER_07]: A Whataburger from Nintendo?

144
00:10:13,358 --> 00:10:14,820
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't think that place was very good.

145
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, alright.

146
00:10:17,402 --> 00:10:19,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, you heathens.

147
00:10:19,284 --> 00:10:20,105
[SPEAKER_05]: You heathens.

148
00:10:20,565 --> 00:10:21,366
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

149
00:10:21,906 --> 00:10:26,991
[SPEAKER_07]: When somebody says they don't like food, when somebody says they don't like food, you say, more for me.

150
00:10:27,772 --> 00:10:28,172
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

151
00:10:28,591 --> 00:10:30,313
[SPEAKER_06]: Except there's not one here!

152
00:10:33,077 --> 00:10:34,139
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

153
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:40,127
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on, I want to get to the gaming news, or in this case, maybe news affecting the gaming industry.

154
00:10:40,227 --> 00:10:44,032
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, quite a bunch of hubba-baloo going on this week.

155
00:10:44,933 --> 00:10:50,301
[SPEAKER_07]: And actually, leaving people wondering if you were caught up in the crossfire, Loki, with this story.

156
00:10:50,321 --> 00:10:50,882
[SPEAKER_07]: I was not.

157
00:10:51,142 --> 00:10:55,628
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think my game's marked NSFW anyways.

158
00:10:55,608 --> 00:11:01,982
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby did some investigative journalism during his show, and it was discovered that, yes, you still can find pixel poops.

159
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell us what this is all about.

160
00:11:03,405 --> 00:11:04,227
[SPEAKER_07]: We're getting ahead of ourselves.

161
00:11:05,069 --> 00:11:12,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so there's a group, I think it's out of Australia, the Collective Shout group.

162
00:11:12,365 --> 00:11:33,563
[SPEAKER_02]: um that basically has been putting pressure on payment processors we talked about this last week with Steam and how they were cracking down on certain um not safe for work games or with adult themes and stuff I think one that they were cracking down on even was like like furry games because they were saying oh it's bestiality or something like that

163
00:11:33,543 --> 00:12:01,592
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever the case may be they were cracking down on a bunch of stuff and now that has spread to itch.io as well which has also cracked down on a bunch of games and even some that aren't necessarily they're not necessarily adult in that sense obviously overreach with LGBTQ plus games that have been affected by it as well

164
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:23,209
[SPEAKER_02]: but yeah so there's a lot of games that have been shadow banned and also they have blocked payments for those games as well so if you're making money on those games all of a sudden now you're not able to access those funds which is stupid because those rules weren't in place to begin with and now they are it's like well hold on like you should be able to have some sort of grace period or something like that

165
00:12:23,189 --> 00:12:32,507
[SPEAKER_02]: but also we shouldn't just let you know these watchdog groups or whatever like pressure everybody into doing things um

166
00:12:33,567 --> 00:12:34,328
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have that.

167
00:12:34,428 --> 00:12:41,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, we even had some larger developers calling this out as well.

168
00:12:42,220 --> 00:13:02,089
[SPEAKER_02]: So the director of Nier Automata, Yoko Taro, was talking about this is basically censorship because we are allowing these companies to essentially bypass the normal regulations to now crack down on free speech.

169
00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:09,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically saying, you know, it implies that by controlling the payment processing companies, you can even censor another country's free speech.

170
00:13:10,229 --> 00:13:19,352
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel it's not just a matter of censoring adult content or jeopardizing freedom of expression, but rather a security hold and dangerous democracy itself.

171
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:47,635
[SPEAKER_07]: and I think he was more talking about Manga Library Z which also got hit with this as well because essentially anything with an NSFW tag on HIO was delisted I think you can still get to it if you have the page directly but you can't search for it which effectively kills the discovery of games outside of social media platforms and things of that sort so obviously there was some

172
00:13:47,615 --> 00:13:53,143
[SPEAKER_07]: Really gross shit out there on these marketplaces that did have a reason to be dealt with.

173
00:13:53,484 --> 00:13:57,189
[SPEAKER_07]: But now this is a case of a massive overcorrection.

174
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:07,344
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think truly what it seems to me truly a case of a activist group not working in our best interest.

175
00:14:07,624 --> 00:14:09,447
[SPEAKER_07]: You give them an inch and they take a mile.

176
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:13,453
[SPEAKER_07]: That is basically I think how we've ended up in this situation.

177
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:17,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it sounds like these payment processors have too much power anyway.

178
00:14:18,206 --> 00:14:20,290
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, can I say something about all that?

179
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:26,059
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm really going to regret saying this, but I have to call it like I see it.

180
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:31,087
[SPEAKER_07]: This whole thing, I know, brace yourselves, I'm going to wince when these words leave my mouth.

181
00:14:31,748 --> 00:14:36,876
[SPEAKER_07]: This whole thing is the first good argument I've heard for cryptocurrency.

182
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:39,861
[SPEAKER_07]: Gross.

183
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:40,863
[SPEAKER_07]: Gross.

184
00:14:41,503 --> 00:14:45,948
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think that speaks to the nature of these big payment... Let's not jump to that.

185
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,670
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, I know, I know.

186
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,532
[SPEAKER_07]: Y'all put the pitchfork and torches down.

187
00:14:49,592 --> 00:14:51,755
[SPEAKER_07]: There's still a lot about it that bothers me.

188
00:14:51,835 --> 00:15:00,324
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think it definitely says something about the fact that these folks, these payment processors, control way too much in the room.

189
00:15:00,344 --> 00:15:07,352
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I can see why people are turning to these alternative forms as a way to go around these payment processors.

190
00:15:09,239 --> 00:15:20,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's really no... What is the worry here that I'm going to think poorly of Visa or MasterCard?

191
00:15:20,192 --> 00:15:23,095
[SPEAKER_02]: I already think poorly of Visa and MasterCard.

192
00:15:23,636 --> 00:15:32,967
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not any amount of goodwill that they could do to have a positive... You are just a means to the end.

193
00:15:34,108 --> 00:15:39,094
[SPEAKER_02]: No one is like, oh, that family company Visa, I love them.

194
00:15:39,074 --> 00:15:40,437
[SPEAKER_02]: No one's saying that.

195
00:15:40,798 --> 00:15:55,716
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting that we are talking about how companies are different in other countries, because correct me if I'm wrong, I swear I was reading somewhere, and it might have been in relation to all this, I don't remember, but they were talking about how, like, in Japan, you can pay for something online online.

196
00:15:55,696 --> 00:15:56,397
[SPEAKER_07]: and print.

197
00:15:56,477 --> 00:16:08,975
[SPEAKER_07]: Instead of using Visa or MasterCard, you basically get a barcode or a receipt number of some type, which you take to a 7-Eleven or an ITO or one of those stores that are very different in Japan than they are.

198
00:16:08,995 --> 00:16:10,597
[SPEAKER_07]: 7-Eleven Japan is nothing like it is here.

199
00:16:10,617 --> 00:16:11,779
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no one's examples, right?

200
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:14,663
[SPEAKER_07]: You take the barcode of one of those stores and you pay for it there.

201
00:16:15,344 --> 00:16:19,270
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it provides a payment alternative to Visa, MasterCard.

202
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:21,012
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not something that's in our culture.

203
00:16:22,274 --> 00:16:23,756
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't really have the means to set up.

204
00:16:23,776 --> 00:16:26,080
[SPEAKER_05]: There's also just going in and buying stuff in the konbini.

205
00:16:27,382 --> 00:16:27,903
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

206
00:16:29,325 --> 00:16:34,553
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you recharge your Suika card and your other type of travel cards and whatnot.

207
00:16:35,215 --> 00:16:38,680
[SPEAKER_05]: But a lot of stuff, like you buy tickets at a konbini.

208
00:16:38,795 --> 00:16:59,655
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of like that though I mean assuming that you could build it in a way that wouldn't be exploited because that's essentially almost like a VPN for payment processing in the sense because you essentially decouple it from the website now you just have this thing that's a transaction number essentially and you just take care of the transaction and Visa, MasterCard they don't know what it's for

209
00:16:59,635 --> 00:17:04,921
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the big brain idea you gamers need to get on because, you know, right now I understand.

210
00:17:05,001 --> 00:17:14,492
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, Loki, if you're going to get to this, but I understand there's a big telephone call campaign to Visa and stuff, which I understand that for, you know, trying to protest to get the message out there and so forth.

211
00:17:14,512 --> 00:17:20,639
[SPEAKER_07]: But like the big brain idea would be to launch that million dollar idea that's going to beat Visa, MasterCard at their own game.

212
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:25,845
[SPEAKER_07]: And I thought something like Venmo is halfway there.

213
00:17:25,825 --> 00:17:33,193
[SPEAKER_07]: I really feel like, especially amongst younger folks, Venmo is a very standard method of payment.

214
00:17:33,233 --> 00:17:35,195
[SPEAKER_07]: Is Venmo and MasterCard tied together?

215
00:17:35,215 --> 00:17:36,637
[SPEAKER_07]: Is Venmo tied to one of the banks?

216
00:17:36,697 --> 00:17:37,458
[SPEAKER_07]: It has to be, right?

217
00:17:38,339 --> 00:17:39,600
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to be something.

218
00:17:40,401 --> 00:17:42,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Apple Pay or something like that?

219
00:17:42,163 --> 00:17:43,204
[SPEAKER_02]: It's PayPal.

220
00:17:45,847 --> 00:17:48,070
[SPEAKER_07]: Venmo is PayPal, but PayPal is Wells Fargo, isn't it?

221
00:17:49,131 --> 00:17:51,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Apple Card is Goldman Sachs.

222
00:17:52,437 --> 00:18:22,073
[SPEAKER_07]: But Apple Pay is not, I don't think.

223
00:18:22,053 --> 00:18:29,423
[SPEAKER_07]: So I do, to some extent, think some things are starting to move away from traditional payment processors.

224
00:18:30,725 --> 00:18:36,313
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just not moving as fast as we need to for something to happen about this particular story.

225
00:18:36,934 --> 00:18:38,997
[SPEAKER_07]: But I do think some of that culture is changing.

226
00:18:39,157 --> 00:18:40,258
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, sorry.

227
00:18:40,779 --> 00:18:46,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it also gets complicated in the sense of, like, I don't know how refunding or anything, like, would work with all that.

228
00:18:47,028 --> 00:18:49,251
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's a whole other bag of worms.

229
00:18:49,271 --> 00:18:49,591
[SPEAKER_02]: True, true.

230
00:18:49,612 --> 00:18:50,052
[SPEAKER_07]: That's fair.

231
00:18:50,192 --> 00:18:50,693
[SPEAKER_07]: That's fair.

232
00:18:52,428 --> 00:18:56,193
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway, was there anything else with the thought there was one more?

233
00:18:56,313 --> 00:19:03,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, just just that there's also obviously because folks aren't really enjoying this thing happening.

234
00:19:03,562 --> 00:19:14,335
[SPEAKER_02]: They are, of course, launching a petition to tell MasterCard, Visa and activist groups stop controlling what we can watch, read or play.

235
00:19:14,315 --> 00:19:33,218
[SPEAKER_02]: and it describes it basically that this is corporate overreach and censorship of legal fictional content and of course it's already received 77,700 petitions as of about a week ago July 17th but

236
00:19:33,974 --> 00:19:43,187
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't know if it's going to do much, but at least, you know, you can let them know that you're not happy with this, and maybe they'll consider changing their mind.

237
00:19:43,268 --> 00:19:45,771
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's still weird, though.

238
00:19:45,811 --> 00:19:51,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't think payment processors should say anything about speech.

239
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,743
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, block illegal activity.

240
00:19:53,763 --> 00:19:55,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, you can try doing that, if you will.

241
00:19:55,906 --> 00:19:58,890
[SPEAKER_02]: But once again, even with that, that's kind of overreach as well.

242
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:00,032
[SPEAKER_02]: Just...

243
00:20:00,788 --> 00:20:05,340
[SPEAKER_02]: function as an ATM or a transaction machine.

244
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:09,390
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't need personality opinions in here.

245
00:20:09,611 --> 00:20:11,997
[SPEAKER_02]: You just do your function and that's it.

246
00:20:14,035 --> 00:20:20,624
[SPEAKER_07]: It's funny because some of you in chat are like, PayPal wants to know your location if you mention sex in your transaction messages.

247
00:20:20,644 --> 00:20:28,075
[SPEAKER_07]: And it really never occurred to me that these payment companies are looking at transaction messages because I have some people that I will go out to brunch with once in a while.

248
00:20:28,556 --> 00:20:31,239
[SPEAKER_07]: And I usually will put it on my card and have people Venmo me.

249
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:35,906
[SPEAKER_07]: And they send me the most disgusting Venmo messages possible as to why they're paying me money.

250
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:39,351
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to try to show you one without doxing somebody here.

251
00:20:39,736 --> 00:20:41,339
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I can do it.

252
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:42,742
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on.

253
00:20:42,762 --> 00:20:44,044
[SPEAKER_07]: Y'all aren't seeing nothing here.

254
00:20:44,345 --> 00:20:47,751
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to show you like an actual payment message I got.

255
00:20:47,812 --> 00:20:48,433
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you see that?

256
00:20:49,254 --> 00:20:51,358
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a bottle of lotion.

257
00:20:51,378 --> 00:20:56,789
[SPEAKER_07]: And the thing is that a lot of other people can see these messages.

258
00:20:57,049 --> 00:20:57,470
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I know.

259
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,292
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why they do it.

260
00:20:59,234 --> 00:21:01,558
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why they leave those types of things.

261
00:21:03,597 --> 00:21:21,268
[SPEAKER_02]: it's for the lotion that you bought at Bed Bath & Beyond or Bed & Body Works it was for fucking chilaquiles it was not for foot lotion, god your pedicure and you went out for eggplant parmesan afterwards so I mean that's, yeah

262
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:40,843
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

263
00:21:40,823 --> 00:21:45,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Rage against customer service, but when I say that, I hope y'all are keeping it in the back of your mind.

264
00:21:45,711 --> 00:21:50,379
[SPEAKER_07]: The people that are taking your call are not the ones that are setting the policy at Visa.

265
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:55,307
[SPEAKER_07]: And if y'all act foolish, that's just going to be what this movement is going to look like, is foolish.

266
00:21:55,768 --> 00:21:56,048
[SPEAKER_07]: But

267
00:21:56,028 --> 00:22:02,779
[SPEAKER_07]: If you act professional in being on the phone and expressing your distaste to this, all of those calls are logged.

268
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:14,319
[SPEAKER_07]: They may tell you to email a thing, which you could do as well, but make sure that your distaste, your grievance, we shall say the formal term, the grievance is logged.

269
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,703
[SPEAKER_07]: So that way Visa has a record of this.

270
00:22:16,683 --> 00:22:20,268
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, Ranmari in chat says emails can be filtered out, though.

271
00:22:20,328 --> 00:22:20,789
[SPEAKER_07]: They can.

272
00:22:21,109 --> 00:22:24,534
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I think legally they have to still track them, but that's it.

273
00:22:24,554 --> 00:22:25,816
[SPEAKER_07]: You're a stat.

274
00:22:25,836 --> 00:22:27,018
[SPEAKER_07]: You're a stat at that point.

275
00:22:27,398 --> 00:22:37,894
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you're on the phone, now that's impacting their call volume, the amount of time, the amount of calls come in, the other calls that aren't getting picked up because they're having to answer to this.

276
00:22:37,914 --> 00:22:40,938
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a very interesting method of protest.

277
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:45,745
[SPEAKER_07]: And, yeah, I agree again with Ranmari's perspective in chat over Twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

278
00:22:45,725 --> 00:22:55,019
[SPEAKER_07]: and I don't think I said it earlier because we do tape live at twitch.tv slash VOG Network, the Voice Geeks Network, every Sunday night at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwell show.

279
00:22:55,099 --> 00:22:57,483
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, 20 years old this week.

280
00:22:57,623 --> 00:22:59,546
[SPEAKER_07]: Our baby cousin turned 20 this week.

281
00:22:59,566 --> 00:23:00,427
[SPEAKER_07]: Congratulations, Bobby.

282
00:23:00,707 --> 00:23:00,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

283
00:23:00,828 --> 00:23:02,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Congratulations.

284
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:04,493
[SPEAKER_07]: Ranmari live in chat says, kill them with kindness.

285
00:23:04,962 --> 00:23:08,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, they have... They log their calls.

286
00:23:08,071 --> 00:23:15,332
[SPEAKER_02]: They usually, like, will... Any call center will usually tag their calls based off of whatever the criteria is about.

287
00:23:15,954 --> 00:23:19,123
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have, like, what they call, like, kind of...

288
00:23:19,795 --> 00:23:48,604
[SPEAKER_02]: not heat reports but it's basically something to the sense of like they're trying to get a like pick up on trends that are happening with you know the call center what type of calls are coming in so they you do want to be polite to obviously the people doing it because most of the time it's even like probably with visas call centers are not even associated with visa they're just using those employees to kind of take those calls but they still track that stuff for metrics so that they can

289
00:23:48,652 --> 00:23:49,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

290
00:23:49,714 --> 00:24:03,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

291
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,484
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, Ranmari says, I worked in customer service.

292
00:24:06,524 --> 00:24:07,806
[SPEAKER_07]: I currently work in medical billing.

293
00:24:07,886 --> 00:24:10,911
[SPEAKER_07]: I get the occasional call of people yelling at me for things that aren't my fault.

294
00:24:10,971 --> 00:24:18,201
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, please, please don't be foolish on the phone with these folks that are not the people that are coming up with policy.

295
00:24:18,442 --> 00:24:20,424
[SPEAKER_07]: They are paid to take the calls from angry people.

296
00:24:20,464 --> 00:24:21,466
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have to be one of them.

297
00:24:22,147 --> 00:24:25,071
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, I would argue you're going to get noticed more

298
00:24:25,051 --> 00:24:26,012
[SPEAKER_07]: by folks.

299
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:29,457
[SPEAKER_07]: If you call in, you're actually nice about it because people, they're going to talk.

300
00:24:29,477 --> 00:24:30,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Those reps are going to talk about this.

301
00:24:30,999 --> 00:24:34,304
[SPEAKER_07]: You getting those people that called today talking about the payment thing on Steam?

302
00:24:34,624 --> 00:24:37,288
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they're really nice, but there's a lot of it.

303
00:24:37,368 --> 00:24:38,149
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to talk.

304
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:42,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Just remember, call centers, a lot of times they're like, you know, entry-level jobs.

305
00:24:43,217 --> 00:24:46,040
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people that are of that age play video games.

306
00:24:46,601 --> 00:24:51,027
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, maybe even aware of what's going on at the company and aren't happy about it too.

307
00:24:51,048 --> 00:24:51,368
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

308
00:24:51,388 --> 00:24:52,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Start a revolt from within.

309
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:54,973
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you hear the people sing?

310
00:24:55,780 --> 00:25:24,049
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the goal.

311
00:25:24,468 --> 00:25:34,440
[SPEAKER_02]: It's certainly... We're seeing, not just with payment processors, there's a lot of things that are attacking free speech and trying to censor things across the entire world.

312
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:38,585
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, it's just... I wonder if that's not how this ultimately ends.

313
00:25:38,605 --> 00:25:52,602
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't think on the itch.io front, but, you know, say a game like a Grand Theft Auto gets banned by this whole thing in the future, because you know Grand Theft Auto is going to be a big fucking deal when it comes out, and it's going to catch the attention of one of these, you know...

314
00:25:52,582 --> 00:26:01,011
[SPEAKER_07]: Anti-free speech organizations that will be trying to get the payment processors to not take money for Grand Theft Auto.

315
00:26:01,352 --> 00:26:08,279
[SPEAKER_07]: And then a big company basically sues the payment processors over their rights to what they can sell.

316
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:15,707
[SPEAKER_07]: And yes, I know free speech does not apply to private corporations, but nothing in this country makes any legal sense anymore.

317
00:26:15,727 --> 00:26:17,690
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're suing people over everything.

318
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:20,092
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's starting at the highest office in the land.

319
00:26:20,112 --> 00:26:21,694
[SPEAKER_07]: So I...

320
00:26:21,674 --> 00:26:27,516
[SPEAKER_07]: If you ask me to say what's going to happen, I think it ends in a lawsuit because that's where everything is going these days.

321
00:26:27,985 --> 00:26:29,487
[SPEAKER_05]: I did watch that South Park, by the way.

322
00:26:30,108 --> 00:26:30,869
[SPEAKER_07]: It was so good.

323
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:42,324
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you know the way they were able to get away with showing that on TV was that they put two little eyeballs on it, like little Michael's craft eyeballs on that.

324
00:26:43,786 --> 00:26:45,769
[SPEAKER_05]: That whole part was AI anyway.

325
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:51,477
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, which I don't agree with using AI, but It's their own company.

326
00:26:51,837 --> 00:26:53,319
[SPEAKER_02]: They own an AI company.

327
00:26:53,499 --> 00:26:56,203
[SPEAKER_07]: A point was made

328
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:04,407
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, but I will say I will never hear the Billy Idol song Eyes Without a Face the same way ever again.

329
00:27:04,427 --> 00:27:07,349
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby Blackwell says Comedy Central TTP.

330
00:27:07,589 --> 00:27:20,681
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to say, though, because I thought this was an interesting comment from SSJ100 Matt in chat who says, So you get fired from your big game studio job and you try to make your games on the indie market, but your game gets taken down because it's offensive to some troll group.

331
00:27:20,981 --> 00:27:22,442
[SPEAKER_07]: This industry isn't fun right now.

332
00:27:22,823 --> 00:27:24,684
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is what I'm also worried about.

333
00:27:24,804 --> 00:27:26,646
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and it's...

334
00:27:26,626 --> 00:27:42,660
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

335
00:27:42,640 --> 00:28:02,438
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

336
00:28:03,127 --> 00:28:14,447
[SPEAKER_07]: It is not... If a drag queen wants to read books to kids at the library, like when I was young, a clown would do at the library.

337
00:28:15,148 --> 00:28:16,670
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, but that's what it was.

338
00:28:17,432 --> 00:28:21,338
[SPEAKER_07]: And for some reason, the right has a problem with one and not the other.

339
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,544
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's just...

340
00:28:25,098 --> 00:28:36,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, that's what I worry about is that they're going to try to say, well, because the game has drag queens in it, it's NSFW, it's an adult game, which then is because trans people are represented, it's NSFW.

341
00:28:36,439 --> 00:28:43,472
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, oh, gay people are in it, it's NSFW, which anything LGBTQIA+, it's NSFW.

342
00:28:43,492 --> 00:28:43,693
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

343
00:28:44,454 --> 00:28:44,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

344
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:57,823
[SPEAKER_05]: If Tammy Faye can wear all of that amount of makeup and cry on public TV reading fiction as well, I think that drag queens can wear all that makeup and cry in public and read fiction.

345
00:28:57,843 --> 00:28:58,464
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I'm with you.

346
00:28:58,504 --> 00:28:59,526
[SPEAKER_07]: You're preaching to the choir.

347
00:28:59,886 --> 00:29:01,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Now that's a religion I can get behind.

348
00:29:03,455 --> 00:29:03,976
[SPEAKER_07]: There we go.

349
00:29:04,357 --> 00:29:04,657
[SPEAKER_07]: Preach.

350
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:07,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Tammy Faye was a drag queen.

351
00:29:07,784 --> 00:29:08,204
[SPEAKER_07]: She was.

352
00:29:08,545 --> 00:29:13,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Elvira was really one of the earliest as well.

353
00:29:13,355 --> 00:29:16,060
[SPEAKER_06]: And Tammy Faye did turn herself around a bit.

354
00:29:16,681 --> 00:29:18,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

355
00:29:18,324 --> 00:29:18,645
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

356
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:47,299
[SPEAKER_07]: Tami had a very interesting life anyway all right uh let's move on let's get into i mean we could we could talk all about Tami Faye uh for three hours but we're gonna talk about our gaming weeks instead and the types of video games that we have been playing this week so DarkSakura i'll start with you how was your gaming week um Mass Effect Dead by Daylight i'm trying to recapture my pig era again um Palia i've been doing quests in Palia um

357
00:29:48,983 --> 00:29:50,645
[SPEAKER_05]: Playing the Suika game.

358
00:29:55,332 --> 00:29:58,837
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't really had time to do much more than my usual stuff.

359
00:29:59,478 --> 00:30:03,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Just because I went back to my Friday ballet class.

360
00:30:04,024 --> 00:30:08,411
[SPEAKER_05]: My whole schedule is going to be changing pretty soon.

361
00:30:11,415 --> 00:30:14,119
[SPEAKER_08]: Not in a bad way.

362
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,160
[SPEAKER_08]: That's good.

363
00:30:16,001 --> 00:30:16,622
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll go to Loki then.

364
00:30:16,642 --> 00:30:17,083
[SPEAKER_08]: Your game of the week.

365
00:30:18,059 --> 00:30:19,342
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty much just Minecraft.

366
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:26,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Still working on coding the data pack for my stuff and then I've been working on other things as well.

367
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Just playing around in the game.

368
00:30:28,245 --> 00:30:30,851
[SPEAKER_02]: But yep, still Minecraft.

369
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:32,355
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always the name Minecraft.

370
00:30:32,656 --> 00:30:34,378
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

371
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:37,523
[SPEAKER_07]: For me, I'm still getting my dailies done in Final Fantasy XIV.

372
00:30:38,424 --> 00:30:43,992
[SPEAKER_07]: I still play a little bit of Diablo 4, but not as much because I've just been playing other stuff.

373
00:30:44,713 --> 00:30:52,844
[SPEAKER_07]: And I will say I was doing, you know, some classic games this week, but I will say the one classic rabbit hole I fell down.

374
00:30:53,085 --> 00:30:53,545
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, boy.

375
00:30:53,766 --> 00:30:54,006
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, boy.

376
00:30:54,026 --> 00:30:56,149
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, you'll appreciate this, though.

377
00:30:56,129 --> 00:31:02,422
[SPEAKER_07]: I started playing Final Fantasy XI again, but this one is one of those private servers.

378
00:31:02,562 --> 00:31:07,433
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't do a very good job keeping this a secret.

379
00:31:08,214 --> 00:31:13,345
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called Horizon, Horizon XI, which launched in...

380
00:31:13,983 --> 00:31:32,464
[SPEAKER_07]: Dune's Parties Warcraft Classic

381
00:31:33,473 --> 00:31:44,950
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be interesting if Square Enix, because you know how we got official World of Warcraft Classic, was Blizzard finally shut down all the servers because they were going to do something official.

382
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:48,736
[SPEAKER_07]: They sent cease and desist to all the private servers and started their own official thing.

383
00:31:48,776 --> 00:31:51,099
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder if someday Square Enix doesn't do something official.

384
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:58,570
[SPEAKER_07]: It still blows my mind that they charge money for Eleven and that it's not just grouped in like a Squeenix Pass event.

385
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:14,517
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

386
00:32:14,497 --> 00:32:34,547
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

387
00:32:34,527 --> 00:32:50,055
[SPEAKER_07]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

388
00:32:50,035 --> 00:33:17,140
[SPEAKER_07]: and uh but level syncing is there so if you want you could take your level 30 character sync it down to level 17 or whatever and go do a Valkyrm Dunes party you can do that and still gain most of the XP there is some penalties to the XP depending on how many people are signed on and all this all these other factors I'm not going to bore you with the stats but um it's interesting that they have put some of those quality of life because level sync was

389
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:37,255
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

390
00:33:37,235 --> 00:33:39,178
[SPEAKER_07]: It's slow.

391
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,661
[SPEAKER_07]: It's slow.

392
00:33:40,681 --> 00:33:43,586
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I've been playing for a couple hours and I may be level 7.

393
00:33:44,127 --> 00:33:46,391
[SPEAKER_07]: But it just took me forever to remember how to do shit.

394
00:33:46,411 --> 00:33:47,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it's so much fun though.

395
00:33:47,853 --> 00:33:50,698
[SPEAKER_07]: The nice thing about Horizon though, like everything is built in.

396
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:54,545
[SPEAKER_07]: Like in the launcher, there's a lot of great add-ons.

397
00:33:54,565 --> 00:34:00,475
[SPEAKER_07]: There's one called Balloon that makes all the quest text look like Final Fantasy XIV.

398
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:03,861
[SPEAKER_07]: and it will support 4K and all that.

399
00:34:03,881 --> 00:34:08,129
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm pretty impressed by the Horizon stuff.

400
00:34:08,149 --> 00:34:20,491
[SPEAKER_07]: So kudos to everybody because that's a labor of love from Final Fantasy XI fans making those servers work with those tweaks that mostly keep it frozen in time but add the quality of life stuff.

401
00:34:20,931 --> 00:34:25,720
[SPEAKER_07]: I do believe they are adding Treasures of Ottergon pretty soon.

402
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:30,093
[SPEAKER_07]: because you can't even do like Blue Mage, Corsair, any of the jobs they added in Otter Gone.

403
00:34:30,113 --> 00:34:33,302
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's something they're looking at adding in the relatively near future.

404
00:34:33,342 --> 00:34:34,967
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of interesting.

405
00:34:36,027 --> 00:34:37,488
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, otherwise, that was my game of the week.

406
00:34:37,548 --> 00:34:42,353
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to get into some gaming news, just some quick notes of weeks we will not be here.

407
00:34:42,573 --> 00:34:50,121
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to be absent a couple weeks in August, so I will not be here on August the 17th, and I will not be here August the 31st.

408
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:57,648
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm on a personal trip on the 17th, and on the 31st, I will be at DragonCon in Atlanta, as I have been for the past decade plus.

409
00:34:58,108 --> 00:35:05,055
[SPEAKER_07]: So as I usually say, and I hope I will see some of you there, if you're in the area, best time to catch me at DragonCon,

410
00:35:05,035 --> 00:35:11,732
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know my full panel lineup yet and I won't until the app is released, which is like two weeks before the convention-ish.

411
00:35:12,233 --> 00:35:20,935
[SPEAKER_07]: But the one thing I do know will happen, I can promise, Thursday night we will have a mixer for the digital media track at...

412
00:35:20,915 --> 00:35:22,517
[SPEAKER_07]: 7 o'clock?

413
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:24,300
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I don't have it in front of me.

414
00:35:25,141 --> 00:35:27,324
[SPEAKER_07]: But look for that on Thursday night.

415
00:35:27,945 --> 00:35:31,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby and I will be there and that is the best place to catch us during the frenzy of DragonCon.

416
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:37,417
[SPEAKER_07]: So come have a nice chill Thursday night with us at the Digital Media Track on Thursday night.

417
00:35:37,437 --> 00:35:43,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything else I will mention closer to probably that show right before is when I will be able to talk about anything else I'm doing at the show.

418
00:35:45,609 --> 00:35:48,192
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's get into some gaming news.

419
00:35:49,053 --> 00:35:50,415
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, we'll start with you.

420
00:35:50,868 --> 00:35:56,039
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we had a Pokemon Presents showcase that showed off a bunch of Pokemon updates.

421
00:35:56,861 --> 00:36:03,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Starting things off, of course, they had a DJ Pikachu animation thing, which is neat, I guess.

422
00:36:04,277 --> 00:36:04,658
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

423
00:36:04,938 --> 00:36:05,800
[SPEAKER_02]: I watched some of it.

424
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:09,568
[SPEAKER_07]: It was not the music I thought they'd be playing.

425
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,342
[SPEAKER_07]: How's that news?

426
00:36:11,362 --> 00:36:12,984
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, that's not news.

427
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,406
[SPEAKER_07]: That affects nothing in the Pokemon.

428
00:36:14,727 --> 00:36:15,568
[SPEAKER_07]: It was cute!

429
00:36:16,089 --> 00:36:17,351
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what's news about it.

430
00:36:17,691 --> 00:36:21,597
[SPEAKER_02]: There's going to be new episodes of Pokemon.

431
00:36:21,617 --> 00:36:24,101
[SPEAKER_07]: I got a Pikachu that's so old back there he's deflating.

432
00:36:24,161 --> 00:36:24,842
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that cute?

433
00:36:25,163 --> 00:36:26,104
[SPEAKER_07]: My little Pikachu pillow?

434
00:36:27,046 --> 00:36:27,666
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that cute?

435
00:36:29,429 --> 00:36:34,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Pokemon Concierge is going to be getting some new episodes starting September 4th.

436
00:36:35,639 --> 00:36:37,902
[SPEAKER_02]: So that'll be coming to Netflix.

437
00:36:38,337 --> 00:36:47,912
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the Pokemon Tales, The Misadventures of Sirfetch'd and Pichu, which is coming in 2027.

438
00:36:51,097 --> 00:36:53,240
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a new stop-motion series.

439
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,043
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing a lot of animation stuff.

440
00:36:56,124 --> 00:37:01,172
[SPEAKER_02]: So that'll be... We're probably going to forget about it by the time it comes out in 2027.

441
00:37:01,743 --> 00:37:10,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Poke Park Kanto, a new outdoor attraction that is opening up in Japan that's made to look like a real forest.

442
00:37:11,253 --> 00:37:13,295
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is set to open up in 2026.

443
00:37:13,396 --> 00:37:16,499
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of neat.

444
00:37:18,401 --> 00:37:19,422
[SPEAKER_07]: Pokemon Go.

445
00:37:19,522 --> 00:37:21,304
[SPEAKER_07]: It didn't look like it had rides or anything like that.

446
00:37:21,324 --> 00:37:23,266
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like it's an Instagram park.

447
00:37:23,406 --> 00:37:25,348
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an Instagram park is what that place looks like.

448
00:37:25,388 --> 00:37:25,849
[SPEAKER_07]: Instagram park?

449
00:37:26,189 --> 00:37:26,289
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

450
00:37:26,309 --> 00:37:26,890
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

451
00:37:27,005 --> 00:37:32,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Pokemon Go Fest 2025 Max Finale is going to be coming soon.

452
00:37:32,632 --> 00:37:40,002
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to take place August 23rd and 24th and will feature Max Pokemon including Eternatus.

453
00:37:43,526 --> 00:37:46,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Neat, I haven't been in Pokemon Go in a while.

454
00:37:47,575 --> 00:37:49,638
[SPEAKER_07]: Eternatus, I think, might be?

455
00:37:49,859 --> 00:37:51,361
[SPEAKER_07]: Eternatus, yeah.

456
00:37:51,381 --> 00:37:52,944
[SPEAKER_07]: Emprisonatus?

457
00:37:52,964 --> 00:37:54,206
[SPEAKER_07]: Empanadas?

458
00:37:54,646 --> 00:37:55,167
[SPEAKER_07]: Empanadas.

459
00:37:55,808 --> 00:37:56,890
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it's empanadas.

460
00:37:59,033 --> 00:38:03,360
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, well, that Pokemon is a pretty big one from Sword and Shield.

461
00:38:03,721 --> 00:38:07,206
[SPEAKER_07]: I still am playing Pokemon Go pretty regularly, at least to incentivize my walk.

462
00:38:07,246 --> 00:38:11,253
[SPEAKER_07]: I do mostly Bluetooth catching, but I'll catch the most random fucking shinies.

463
00:38:11,313 --> 00:38:13,937
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, just in the last week, I got a shiny Aeron.

464
00:38:13,917 --> 00:38:40,600
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

465
00:38:41,137 --> 00:38:49,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Pokemon Masters EX Pokemon Masters X Yes.

466
00:38:49,588 --> 00:38:51,611
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what everybody's wanted, I guess.

467
00:38:52,953 --> 00:39:05,490
[SPEAKER_02]: It is going to be getting Carmine and Sinestra as a sync pair on July 29th, or at least starting July 29th through September 6th.

468
00:39:05,791 --> 00:39:07,794
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'll be able to participate with that.

469
00:39:09,295 --> 00:39:12,640
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, Pokemon Cafe Remix.

470
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,782
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, are you glitching?

471
00:39:16,444 --> 00:39:16,725
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I?

472
00:39:17,125 --> 00:39:19,388
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you disappearing into the Matrix?

473
00:39:19,408 --> 00:39:22,472
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, you keep blinking, which I'm like, what the hell is happening?

474
00:39:22,532 --> 00:39:22,793
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

475
00:39:22,873 --> 00:39:23,273
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

476
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:28,179
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm actually looking at... Well, it stopped now.

477
00:39:28,259 --> 00:39:29,982
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, now that I said something, it stopped.

478
00:39:30,482 --> 00:39:31,283
[SPEAKER_07]: So, whatever.

479
00:39:31,443 --> 00:39:32,785
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, go ahead, Loki.

480
00:39:32,805 --> 00:39:33,486
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

481
00:39:33,803 --> 00:39:49,280
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a bunch of pirate-themed characters and cosmetics coming to the game Pokemon Cafe Remix, including Captain Outfits for Lapras, Lone Mouth, Toadtodile, and Messino.

482
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:49,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Neat.

483
00:39:49,841 --> 00:39:53,665
[SPEAKER_02]: And they also have a summer-themed Jigglypuff.

484
00:39:53,866 --> 00:39:54,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, what else?

485
00:39:55,367 --> 00:39:56,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Pokemon Sleep!

486
00:39:56,929 --> 00:40:01,414
[SPEAKER_02]: Legendary beasts are coming to Pokemon Sleep, but you'll never see them because you'll be asleep.

487
00:40:03,925 --> 00:40:04,526
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming out in August.

488
00:40:04,546 --> 00:40:06,488
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not how the game works, Loki.

489
00:40:06,508 --> 00:40:07,369
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not how the game works?

490
00:40:07,389 --> 00:40:08,070
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not how the game works.

491
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:09,832
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know anything about Pokemon Sleep.

492
00:40:10,152 --> 00:40:11,533
[SPEAKER_02]: It measures your sleep.

493
00:40:11,694 --> 00:40:16,939
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a game where you try to play Pokemon, but every time you bring out your Pokemon, they're asleep.

494
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,962
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're just like, I don't know what to do here, man.

495
00:40:19,002 --> 00:40:21,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, do we fight now?

496
00:40:21,705 --> 00:40:22,185
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

497
00:40:22,806 --> 00:40:25,749
[SPEAKER_07]: When that game first came out, I failed to see the point completely.

498
00:40:25,769 --> 00:40:28,212
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I played it for a little bit.

499
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:51,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Pogo Plus Pokemon Unite Lataius

500
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:53,222
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know these Pokemon.

501
00:40:53,743 --> 00:40:55,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, join the roster.

502
00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:58,630
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be coming, I guess, August 8th.

503
00:40:59,271 --> 00:41:02,375
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they have a new battle mode called Electrode Volleyball.

504
00:41:03,577 --> 00:41:06,681
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's going to be, I guess, available now in the game as well.

505
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:10,326
[SPEAKER_02]: More Pokemon TCG stuff.

506
00:41:10,446 --> 00:41:18,938
[SPEAKER_02]: They showed off some new full art Mega Evolution cards, including Lucario, Gardevoir...

507
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:49,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Kangaskhan and Venusaur so cool there we have Pokemon Friends is going to be let's see Pokemon Friends which was released on the App Store it's getting a they're also a new puzzle game I guess called Pokemon Friends and I'm not really sure what it is it says you get plushies by solving short puzzles in a variety of classic traditional brain teaser formats

508
00:41:50,407 --> 00:42:18,709
[SPEAKER_02]: and I think that's the game you can do you can do one puzzle and then you gotta pay for it free to play free to play technically true um and then we had what was it Pokemon Scarlet and Violet talking about the Switch 2 upgrades for that as well as they're gonna be getting new terror raids for the Treasures of Ruin um

509
00:42:19,887 --> 00:42:23,633
[SPEAKER_02]: But you'll only be able to capture them after the raids have been completed 1 million times.

510
00:42:24,394 --> 00:42:26,937
[SPEAKER_02]: That's stupid.

511
00:42:26,957 --> 00:42:28,760
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of stuff just makes you think it's stupid.

512
00:42:30,322 --> 00:42:34,589
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the first footage of Pokemon Champions, the battle simulator game.

513
00:42:34,689 --> 00:42:43,482
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to include ranked, private battles, new training mode, and it's coming to Switch and Mobile 2026.

514
00:42:45,149 --> 00:43:13,840
[SPEAKER_02]: and then finally we got some more footage of Pokemon ZA Legends or Pokemon Legends ZA and yeah they showed off some gameplay on the Nintendo Switch too which thankfully doesn't look like ass so that's good it's gonna be it looks like fun I'm actually really hyped for this game I'm really excited to get it yeah and yeah games are supposed to be coming out October 16th that's gonna be here before we know it

515
00:43:14,326 --> 00:43:14,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

516
00:43:14,847 --> 00:43:15,649
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry for that, though.

517
00:43:15,669 --> 00:43:16,351
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty much it.

518
00:43:16,371 --> 00:43:20,401
[SPEAKER_07]: I gotta say, yeah, I gotta say, I wasn't, like, blown away by this Pokemon Presents.

519
00:43:20,421 --> 00:43:26,516
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, obviously, Legends Z through A is great, and so I know they gotta do a little bit of the hype machine for that, but I don't know.

520
00:43:26,536 --> 00:43:29,584
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought maybe there'd be something kinda new in it, or maybe...

521
00:43:29,564 --> 00:43:58,052
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, maybe I just set the bar too high in my mind I'm still really disappointed we don't really have decent ways to play the old Pokemon games considering the fact that Nintendo's really pivoted away from the 3DS and the DS and so those ports of Pokemon Yellow and all that stuff not that I need to necessarily play Pokemon Yellow again but it would be nice to have some of those older Pokemon games maybe in the Switch library maybe just to hear about some other games that are coming out for Switch 2

522
00:43:58,032 --> 00:44:15,855
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah.

523
00:44:17,135 --> 00:44:37,495
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie, you've talked plenty about Dear Esther.

524
00:44:37,535 --> 00:44:41,299
[SPEAKER_07]: That was another one of their titles as well, kind of the OG game in that genre.

525
00:44:41,439 --> 00:44:42,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Both, they were great.

526
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:44,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Little Orpheus, another game they made.

527
00:44:45,045 --> 00:44:46,007
[SPEAKER_07]: I missed this one.

528
00:44:46,027 --> 00:44:48,612
[SPEAKER_07]: They made a game recently called Still Wakes the Deep.

529
00:44:49,574 --> 00:44:50,636
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't checked that game out.

530
00:44:50,676 --> 00:44:52,319
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks very different from some of their other titles.

531
00:44:52,339 --> 00:44:56,386
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I've not played this yet, so maybe I need to wake up.

532
00:44:56,407 --> 00:45:04,101
[SPEAKER_07]: But you may or may not know, the Chinese room at some point was acquired by Sumo Group.

533
00:45:04,081 --> 00:45:10,957
[SPEAKER_07]: and then Tencent bought Sumo in 2021 for $1.27 billion.

534
00:45:10,977 --> 00:45:16,289
[SPEAKER_07]: So this really was a case of fish gets eaten by bigger fish gets eaten by biggest fish.

535
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:23,305
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, apparently what has happened is that the Chinese room has now bought back its independence.

536
00:45:23,285 --> 00:45:24,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay!

537
00:45:24,748 --> 00:45:41,817
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay!

538
00:45:41,797 --> 00:45:43,981
[SPEAKER_07]: which is the British way of saying that.

539
00:45:44,061 --> 00:45:47,727
[SPEAKER_07]: The specifics are confidential but the studio is currently 55 developers.

540
00:45:48,088 --> 00:45:52,575
[SPEAKER_07]: This was a very difficult process as we saw a future for the studio outside of Sumo.

541
00:45:52,595 --> 00:45:55,640
[SPEAKER_07]: No more layoffs are planned as the studio moves forward.

542
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:56,582
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's...

543
00:45:57,187 --> 00:45:59,030
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess take that for what it's worth.

544
00:45:59,391 --> 00:46:00,773
[SPEAKER_07]: But they are going to be independent.

545
00:46:01,714 --> 00:46:07,263
[SPEAKER_07]: They are also working on Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines 2 in conjunction with Paradox.

546
00:46:07,844 --> 00:46:10,428
[SPEAKER_07]: That title is supposed to be launching in October.

547
00:46:10,448 --> 00:46:16,478
[SPEAKER_07]: They are also, they meaning the Chinese room, is developing two other games that are not yet announced.

548
00:46:16,458 --> 00:46:34,103
[SPEAKER_07]: In a quote on this whole thing, the studio ahead, Ed Daly, said, This management buyout allows us to scratch the creative itch of continuing to work on new, original intellectual property, but also to partner with other studios on projects when they fit in with our vision.

549
00:46:34,123 --> 00:46:39,190
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what we're doing, and we want to carry on doing it, so we're happy to carry on in this vein.

550
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:44,017
[SPEAKER_07]: So kind of a mixed bag of news there is that, you know, hooray for the independents, but at what cost?

551
00:46:44,818 --> 00:46:46,060
[SPEAKER_07]: So it'll be...

552
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:46,781
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be interesting.

553
00:46:46,801 --> 00:46:49,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Questbuster points out Still Wakes the Deep was really good.

554
00:46:49,485 --> 00:46:50,507
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how I missed that.

555
00:46:50,787 --> 00:46:58,099
[SPEAKER_07]: I usually try to follow and see if that studio's got anything coming out, but I guess that just kind of missed my radar.

556
00:46:58,439 --> 00:46:59,982
[SPEAKER_07]: How'd that happen?

557
00:47:00,002 --> 00:47:01,384
[SPEAKER_07]: I must have been asleep.

558
00:47:01,404 --> 00:47:02,165
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll have to check that out.

559
00:47:02,225 --> 00:47:04,309
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe I can find it.

560
00:47:04,489 --> 00:47:06,131
[SPEAKER_07]: When did that game actually come out?

561
00:47:07,494 --> 00:47:08,715
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the other kind of question I have.

562
00:47:08,755 --> 00:47:12,942
[SPEAKER_07]: How long have I been officially sleeping on this game?

563
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:16,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, 2024, it was released.

564
00:47:16,835 --> 00:47:19,319
[SPEAKER_07]: June 18th, it's about a year old at this point.

565
00:47:19,479 --> 00:47:21,763
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting, I gotta get on that.

566
00:47:21,783 --> 00:47:23,667
[SPEAKER_07]: Windows, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.

567
00:47:24,147 --> 00:47:25,790
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a psychological horror game.

568
00:47:27,072 --> 00:47:29,096
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm, sounds like fun.

569
00:47:29,116 --> 00:47:30,158
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's move on.

570
00:47:30,178 --> 00:47:31,420
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, what do you got for us?

571
00:47:32,817 --> 00:47:52,007
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

572
00:47:51,987 --> 00:48:08,081
[SPEAKER_05]: The producer of the game, Lee Cocker, said that they were going to introduce Pokemon characters in Street Fighter, Mega Man, go in the Dragon Ball franchise, Metal Gear Solid, Legend of Zelda, some Sony and Microsoft properties.

573
00:48:08,641 --> 00:48:10,183
[SPEAKER_05]: But that never happened.

574
00:48:10,203 --> 00:48:11,864
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a licensing nightmare.

575
00:48:13,065 --> 00:48:14,586
[SPEAKER_05]: So they just stuck with what they had.

576
00:48:17,289 --> 00:48:21,252
[SPEAKER_07]: Always fun to hear about the stuff that got cut from games, as frustrating as it can be.

577
00:48:22,852 --> 00:48:25,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but honestly, don't overcomplicate it.

578
00:48:25,616 --> 00:48:26,097
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

579
00:48:26,478 --> 00:48:27,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep it simple.

580
00:48:27,439 --> 00:48:27,639
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

581
00:48:29,622 --> 00:48:33,669
[SPEAKER_05]: And building off of the old rivalry was a smart move, keeping it that way.

582
00:48:33,689 --> 00:48:34,730
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm just saying.

583
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:35,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Just saying.

584
00:48:35,592 --> 00:48:35,812
[SPEAKER_07]: True.

585
00:48:36,293 --> 00:48:39,598
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, and then the whole 2020 Olympic Games kind of got screwed up anyway.

586
00:48:39,678 --> 00:48:41,881
[SPEAKER_07]: Orange right in chat says, Super Smash Olympics.

587
00:48:42,061 --> 00:48:42,843
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, kind of.

588
00:48:42,923 --> 00:48:44,766
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of what it was going towards, wasn't it?

589
00:48:44,786 --> 00:48:45,687
[SPEAKER_07]: That's funny.

590
00:48:47,253 --> 00:48:48,515
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on.

591
00:48:48,776 --> 00:48:49,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki.

592
00:48:50,418 --> 00:48:51,600
[SPEAKER_07]: Complaining works, right?

593
00:48:52,462 --> 00:48:53,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, apparently.

594
00:48:53,423 --> 00:49:03,079
[SPEAKER_02]: So everybody was unhappy with the fact that, well, Nintendo kicked off this whole $80 brand new game thing.

595
00:49:04,021 --> 00:49:09,750
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, you know, the next studio to announce that their game was going to be $80 was Nintendo.

596
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:11,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Obsidian with the Outer Worlds 2.

597
00:49:12,354 --> 00:49:14,356
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, everyone complained about it.

598
00:49:14,376 --> 00:49:16,239
[SPEAKER_02]: And now they've walked it back.

599
00:49:16,259 --> 00:49:29,257
[SPEAKER_02]: So they put out a social media post saying, Dear Galactic Citizens, we have received your SOS via skip drone and are about the pricing as an organization devoted to make sure that corporations do not go unfettered.

600
00:49:29,277 --> 00:49:36,987
[SPEAKER_02]: We here at Earth Dictorate have worked with Redacted to revise the price of Outer Worlds 2.

601
00:49:36,967 --> 00:49:40,013
[SPEAKER_02]: and essentially dropped it down to $69.99.

602
00:49:40,474 --> 00:49:43,820
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll call it $70 because that's what it is.

603
00:49:44,441 --> 00:49:46,425
[SPEAKER_02]: $70, yes, basically.

604
00:49:47,367 --> 00:49:53,659
[SPEAKER_02]: Along with that, we also have news that Call of Duty Black Ops 7 is also only going to be $70 and not...

605
00:49:55,259 --> 00:49:59,062
[SPEAKER_02]: The price point for the game itself will be $70.

606
00:49:59,203 --> 00:50:02,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's not kid ourselves that it's only going to be $70.

607
00:50:02,445 --> 00:50:08,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Your limited editions, your special editions, your early access editions.

608
00:50:08,811 --> 00:50:12,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so $70 as well.

609
00:50:12,334 --> 00:50:24,405
[SPEAKER_02]: So for right now, they've walked it back and the price point of $70 that people didn't like before now is a little bit easier to digest, I guess, because it's not $80.

610
00:50:25,735 --> 00:50:46,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, this really seems like a case of the internet getting what it wants, which I think is very interesting because it seems to indicate that, I mean, I don't, the only logical reason I can see that they are retreating from this, not just from one game, but all of, because all those games are Microsoft first party at this point with everything Microsoft's acquired in the last five years.

611
00:50:47,085 --> 00:50:48,587
[SPEAKER_07]: All those games are Microsoft first party.

612
00:50:49,008 --> 00:50:55,557
[SPEAKER_07]: This shows that Microsoft is retreating from that $80, which indicates to me the only reason you do that, the pre-orders weren't pre-ordering.

613
00:50:55,537 --> 00:51:00,583
[SPEAKER_07]: People were pushing back and voting with your wallet actually worked.

614
00:51:00,603 --> 00:51:02,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, of course, we don't have the stats to back that up.

615
00:51:02,706 --> 00:51:05,589
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not going to say pre-orders are at an all-time low.

616
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:12,538
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I guess we could investigate with some retail outlets out there, but we probably are not going to get the full story on the why.

617
00:51:12,919 --> 00:51:18,085
[SPEAKER_07]: But it would seem to indicate that people were not willing to pay $80 for a video game.

618
00:51:18,065 --> 00:51:42,975
[SPEAKER_07]: Most likely, yeah.

619
00:51:42,955 --> 00:51:45,641
[SPEAKER_07]: Most people got it as a pack-in for their Switch 2.

620
00:51:46,343 --> 00:51:56,968
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I realize it was still the number one selling game outside of that, but I think that is... Once again, I think that's limited by who buys a Switch 2 and then buys the game.

621
00:51:57,248 --> 00:51:58,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Who would be buying that separately unless you got...

622
00:51:58,852 --> 00:52:05,580
[SPEAKER_07]: People that were desperate to get that day one so they could play with their friends or just the status of it or otherwise.

623
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,344
[SPEAKER_07]: I think at the end of the day, you can explain it a hundred different ways.

624
00:52:09,364 --> 00:52:12,388
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not an accurate barometer for the rest of the gaming industry.

625
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:22,480
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the accurate check for Nintendo will be if they decide to price something else at $80 because they didn't do it with Donkey Kong Bonanza.

626
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:35,068
[SPEAKER_07]: and good thing they didn't because Donkey Kong Bonanza is a pretty good game and I worry the only thing in that conversation would be the $80 price tag if it had been $80 because it's a good game but it isn't exactly anything...

627
00:52:37,107 --> 00:53:01,731
[SPEAKER_07]: Prime 4 at $80.

628
00:53:01,711 --> 00:53:07,099
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, now that I'm thinking about it, I hope they don't because they're going to set that game up for failure.

629
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:08,300
[SPEAKER_02]: A new Zelda game, yes.

630
00:53:09,342 --> 00:53:10,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Metroid, no.

631
00:53:10,383 --> 00:53:11,885
[SPEAKER_07]: ZA isn't at 80, right?

632
00:53:11,905 --> 00:53:17,693
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that was in the news recently because I think that surprised a lot of us that Pokemon ZA is not going to be 80, right?

633
00:53:18,194 --> 00:53:22,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that would be the game I would think they would do it with a mainline Pokemon game.

634
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:41,117
[SPEAKER_07]: would make sense for them to try at $80 but again that's going to be the more accurate barometer of where the $80 price tag is going to be effective for Nintendo but very clearly the others are retreating for it which is not a good sign for Nintendo leaning into this for a future game of theirs.

635
00:53:41,857 --> 00:53:59,629
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

636
00:53:59,761 --> 00:54:16,656
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

637
00:54:16,636 --> 00:54:34,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

638
00:54:34,608 --> 00:54:37,211
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's no need to be disrespectful about it.

639
00:54:37,551 --> 00:54:38,813
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, $80 price tag?

640
00:54:38,833 --> 00:54:39,413
[SPEAKER_07]: No, thank you.

641
00:54:39,494 --> 00:54:40,875
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll wait for a sale.

642
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:49,425
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a very effective... Because I think for... And God, that's probably a true statement for a large percentage of people who don't buy games on day one anymore.

643
00:54:49,725 --> 00:54:53,409
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they know they're going to be on sale, on Game Pass, something.

644
00:54:53,429 --> 00:54:56,793
[SPEAKER_07]: There's going to be another way to acquire it for far less cheaper later on.

645
00:54:57,134 --> 00:55:02,860
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just for those fans that really want to be in there day one for whatever reason that are willing to... Which...

646
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:04,422
[SPEAKER_07]: is me with a Final Fantasy game.

647
00:55:04,483 --> 00:55:05,344
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm willing to admit that.

648
00:55:06,025 --> 00:55:09,430
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm sure we all have franchises we would do that sort of thing for.

649
00:55:09,450 --> 00:55:26,296
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's interesting to see what games boardrooms think are worth $80 that then people go back and say, no, this is not something I'm going to take a gamble on.

650
00:55:26,316 --> 00:55:30,282
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a whole other thing, too, is that there's no guarantee an $80 game is going to be good.

651
00:55:30,565 --> 00:55:36,171
[SPEAKER_07]: You know Ubisoft is itching to charge $80 for games and that's a whole other issue.

652
00:55:36,831 --> 00:55:38,012
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, sure.

653
00:55:38,853 --> 00:55:45,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they're stupid and delusional and think that their games are AAA games and then they put out some pirate game that sucks.

654
00:55:48,062 --> 00:55:49,484
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just awful.

655
00:55:51,886 --> 00:55:58,633
[SPEAKER_02]: That did real well for your Assassin's Creed game that you delayed again because it wasn't up to snuff.

656
00:55:58,933 --> 00:55:59,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.

657
00:56:01,025 --> 00:56:11,961
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can, if Rockstar Games came out and said, yeah, we're a quadruple A studio, I would be able to, you know, that would be something, you know, okay, maybe, yeah, okay, yeah, I'd get, I'd buy that.

658
00:56:11,981 --> 00:56:14,324
[SPEAKER_02]: But, like, Ubisoft, come on.

659
00:56:14,925 --> 00:56:16,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, Ubisoft.

660
00:56:16,147 --> 00:56:16,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Look in the mirror.

661
00:56:16,868 --> 00:56:18,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I mean, really?

662
00:56:18,610 --> 00:56:20,493
[SPEAKER_02]: You've made Far Cry how many times now?

663
00:56:20,593 --> 00:56:27,523
[SPEAKER_02]: And while I'm talking about Far Cry, I'm talking about every other game that you've made while Far Cry has existed has basically been Far Cry.

664
00:56:27,563 --> 00:56:29,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, how many times have you made Far Cry?

665
00:56:29,982 --> 00:56:30,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Too many.

666
00:56:31,544 --> 00:56:36,010
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to get to another comment in our chat room, kind of tying this back to the beginning of the show.

667
00:56:36,651 --> 00:56:41,778
[SPEAKER_07]: TigerClaw in chat at twitch.tv slash VOG Network says, do you think those bullying tactics will work against Visa?

668
00:56:42,219 --> 00:56:46,124
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean, technically they sent out a general response.

669
00:56:46,985 --> 00:56:49,328
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I think it's going to take something bigger in that case.

670
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:52,192
[SPEAKER_07]: I do think it is worth calling and voicing your opinion.

671
00:56:52,252 --> 00:56:54,235
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it tactfully...

672
00:56:54,215 --> 00:56:55,717
[SPEAKER_07]: It is worth calling and voicing.

673
00:56:55,737 --> 00:57:03,449
[SPEAKER_07]: And all of this has to be done tactfully because if you just give ammunition to the gamers or trash and they like nothing but trash file, then people are going to use that.

674
00:57:03,530 --> 00:57:04,371
[SPEAKER_07]: So don't be trash.

675
00:57:04,751 --> 00:57:10,420
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think anybody listening to this show, I don't think needs to hear that, but maybe some of the people you know need to hear it.

676
00:57:10,701 --> 00:57:14,266
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be what I would think about that.

677
00:57:14,286 --> 00:57:22,399
[SPEAKER_07]: I do think, you know, Itch.io is not a very large publisher when all is said and done, or I should say storefront of games.

678
00:57:22,379 --> 00:57:24,142
[SPEAKER_07]: Steam kind of is though.

679
00:57:26,385 --> 00:57:33,257
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet if Steam said we are now only going to take payments through Venmo or something like that, I bet they would do well enough.

680
00:57:33,357 --> 00:57:35,861
[SPEAKER_07]: They could weather the storm for a bit.

681
00:57:36,121 --> 00:57:37,383
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think they'll do that.

682
00:57:37,403 --> 00:57:38,124
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think they will.

683
00:57:38,485 --> 00:57:45,857
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think they have a little bit more negotiating power when it comes to Visa and MasterCard to be able to say no.

684
00:57:46,498 --> 00:57:46,598
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

685
00:57:46,578 --> 00:57:47,599
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends.

686
00:57:47,719 --> 00:58:09,101
[SPEAKER_02]: I think right now, because what the demands are from the payment processors is it's not impacting sales enough, but if they started saying, oh, we're going to crack down on all violent games, we've got to protect the children or something like that, where it would affect more of their library than they may have some pushback.

687
00:58:09,501 --> 00:58:13,986
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that they're going to just be like, oh, yeah, we're going to take off all the M-rated games off this platform.

688
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:17,443
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, they're not going to do that.

689
00:58:17,463 --> 00:58:18,184
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, right.

690
00:58:18,645 --> 00:58:34,504
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think the optics, if they do delist something that isn't really adult because of the whole thing I was talking about before with LGBTQ or other types of themes, I think the optics of that would be so bad for Valve that they can't have that happening to them.

691
00:58:34,524 --> 00:58:35,545
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be very, very bad.

692
00:58:35,565 --> 00:58:39,010
[SPEAKER_07]: So they have a little more leverage to push back against the payment processors.

693
00:58:39,350 --> 00:58:40,952
[SPEAKER_07]: When all is said and done,

694
00:58:40,932 --> 00:58:44,997
[SPEAKER_07]: Itch.io is, I guarantee you Itch.io is not a large organization.

695
00:58:45,578 --> 00:58:52,507
[SPEAKER_07]: I guarantee you Itch.io does not have a large legal staff ready to deal with these sorts of situations.

696
00:58:53,329 --> 00:58:58,095
[SPEAKER_07]: Valve probably has more, but you know who'd have a ton?

697
00:58:58,115 --> 00:58:58,836
[SPEAKER_07]: Microsoft.

698
00:58:59,517 --> 00:59:05,965
[SPEAKER_07]: So if they try to start to, you know, I mean, do this, but already the consoles are pretty limiting in what they offer.

699
00:59:06,046 --> 00:59:07,908
[SPEAKER_07]: The consoles don't list AO games.

700
00:59:07,968 --> 00:59:09,370
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have adult games like that.

701
00:59:09,390 --> 00:59:10,872
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so.

702
00:59:11,155 --> 00:59:16,662
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Itch just does not have the staff to be able to push back against this at the end of the day.

703
00:59:16,783 --> 00:59:17,704
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't have a legal team.

704
00:59:18,244 --> 00:59:26,035
[SPEAKER_07]: So they are more looking at, in order for us to not have to hire a lawyer and stay solvent, how do we get around this?

705
00:59:26,496 --> 00:59:30,561
[SPEAKER_07]: And now the baby got thrown out with the bathwater, which I really hate that expression, but it applies here.

706
00:59:30,941 --> 00:59:32,343
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what happened with Itch.io.

707
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:36,509
[SPEAKER_07]: And now they're going to have to backtrack.

708
00:59:36,529 --> 00:59:40,074
[SPEAKER_07]: But blame the organization that's starting all this shit.

709
00:59:40,094 --> 00:59:41,095
[SPEAKER_07]: They know what they're doing.

710
00:59:42,003 --> 01:00:06,492
[SPEAKER_02]: mm-hmm all right which is weird though like because how many people does that organization actually have why does one person complaining to payment processors cause I think they rallied a thousand I think they rallied a thousand okay but in 77,000 they're like oh well you know forget them but like a thousand people mad at us oh no like

711
01:00:07,619 --> 01:00:11,786
[SPEAKER_02]: What they should be doing is they should be like, listen, man, we're Visa.

712
01:00:11,986 --> 01:00:13,088
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a thousand people.

713
01:00:13,128 --> 01:00:17,375
[SPEAKER_02]: You mean nothing to us.

714
01:00:17,395 --> 01:00:18,417
[SPEAKER_07]: You're in Australia.

715
01:00:18,797 --> 01:00:20,520
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't even have the right time.

716
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:21,021
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on.

717
01:00:21,822 --> 01:00:23,084
[SPEAKER_07]: Your seasons are backwards.

718
01:00:23,124 --> 01:00:24,426
[SPEAKER_07]: Your toilets swim the other way.

719
01:00:24,446 --> 01:00:26,149
[SPEAKER_05]: With all these 30-minute increments, huh?

720
01:00:26,249 --> 01:00:27,211
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm kidding.

721
01:00:27,231 --> 01:00:27,672
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm kidding.

722
01:00:27,752 --> 01:00:29,134
[SPEAKER_07]: We have folks that listen to Australia.

723
01:00:29,194 --> 01:00:29,895
[SPEAKER_07]: You all are great.

724
01:00:30,376 --> 01:00:32,820
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know this organization is nutso, too.

725
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:34,082
[SPEAKER_07]: So, all right.

726
01:00:34,062 --> 01:00:35,704
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on.

727
01:00:35,724 --> 01:00:38,047
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's talk about other things going on with Steam.

728
01:00:38,067 --> 01:00:49,561
[SPEAKER_07]: So the Steam client beta is testing a new design for the storefront, which is to try to make it a little easier to find games that you might be interested because this is the age-old problem, right?

729
01:00:49,921 --> 01:00:54,687
[SPEAKER_07]: Steam is so full of games, it is hard to find things that you might actually be interested in.

730
01:00:54,727 --> 01:01:01,555
[SPEAKER_07]: Discoverability is a problem on any storefront these days, whether it's mobile, Steam...

731
01:01:01,535 --> 01:01:04,922
[SPEAKER_07]: All of it is in the same boat.

732
01:01:04,943 --> 01:01:09,011
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're trying new things to see what might be able to break through with that.

733
01:01:09,032 --> 01:01:19,695
[SPEAKER_07]: So the latest beta update, instead of having a bunch of text links and menu buttons, this remodel will have everything into an organized menu at the top.

734
01:01:19,675 --> 01:01:25,622
[SPEAKER_07]: So what happens is that you will get, quote, easier access to the places Steam users most frequently visit.

735
01:01:26,163 --> 01:01:31,690
[SPEAKER_07]: A browse feature lets you go into games based on top sellers, new releases, or sales.

736
01:01:32,190 --> 01:01:44,485
[SPEAKER_07]: The recommendations will let you explore what Steam thinks you're going to be into based on the things that you've played, the things that you've acquired in your library, or even things that maybe communities that you're in have recommended.

737
01:01:44,465 --> 01:01:55,623
[SPEAKER_07]: The categories menu button will let you look at the top genres of games that you're playing and then give you tags that are kind of along those same lines to find similar games.

738
01:01:56,024 --> 01:02:00,972
[SPEAKER_07]: Things like Great on Steam Deck, Immersive Sim, Demos.

739
01:02:00,952 --> 01:02:03,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Adult Video Games.

740
01:02:03,134 --> 01:02:04,235
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm kidding.

741
01:02:05,016 --> 01:02:11,322
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, Steam will also show the most popular searches, your games that you've viewed, and top genres.

742
01:02:11,702 --> 01:02:16,967
[SPEAKER_07]: And there is a button for advanced search if you want to go through all the filters and tags and all of that.

743
01:02:16,987 --> 01:02:18,629
[SPEAKER_07]: None of these are new features.

744
01:02:18,649 --> 01:02:28,798
[SPEAKER_07]: It is just a way for them to reorganize the features that are already there to try to make the button bloat of the menu on Steam today a little less popular.

745
01:02:28,778 --> 01:02:29,759
[SPEAKER_07]: So that could be interesting.

746
01:02:29,779 --> 01:02:35,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, if you want to check that out, you could just opt into the Steam Client Beta and take a look at it for yourself.

747
01:02:35,224 --> 01:02:40,508
[SPEAKER_07]: But that will probably just be a matter of time before it shows up for everybody.

748
01:02:41,889 --> 01:02:42,570
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, moving on.

749
01:02:42,590 --> 01:02:43,090
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.

750
01:02:45,092 --> 01:02:49,896
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, for people, this is actually, I'm going to put this in the realm of better news.

751
01:02:49,916 --> 01:02:58,043
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if anyone is familiar with Project FX's, sorry, SideFX Project Elderwood.

752
01:02:58,411 --> 01:03:16,507
[SPEAKER_05]: is a sort of a demonstration of some of their rendering tools meant for creating video game assets, including in-game vegetation and scenery, all sorts of things like that, all procedural tools for generating these things.

753
01:03:16,968 --> 01:03:27,017
[SPEAKER_05]: So they have released their custom Houdini tools for use in

754
01:03:26,997 --> 01:03:30,624
[SPEAKER_05]: For anyone who will be interested in using it.

755
01:03:34,050 --> 01:03:41,684
[SPEAKER_05]: It's based off of a custom tool called Natsura, which is like a new tree plugin thing.

756
01:03:41,704 --> 01:03:47,875
[SPEAKER_05]: If I remember correctly, I do believe this is going to be for Unreal Engine 5.

757
01:03:49,002 --> 01:04:10,335
[SPEAKER_05]: but um but yeah i mean it is it is something you know you got to pay for licensing but um but it's a lot of assets and i know that we've got people um and actually the project elderwood files themselves are free um so you can get uh get that and see how everything is put together

758
01:04:10,315 --> 01:04:22,152
[SPEAKER_05]: But, yeah, I think that if anyone out there is into a little bit more higher end game design, this is something I'd say we're thinking about.

759
01:04:24,335 --> 01:04:24,816
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

760
01:04:25,116 --> 01:04:34,309
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I don't make a lot of games, so it's hard for you to put that in that context, but I think it's neat that the accessibility and information, I guess, is out there for everybody.

761
01:04:34,469 --> 01:04:34,970
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty cool.

762
01:04:36,552 --> 01:04:37,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, yep.

763
01:04:38,315 --> 01:04:38,415
Cool.

764
01:04:38,581 --> 01:04:45,891
[SPEAKER_05]: If any of our designer friends out there are using stuff like this, let us know.

765
01:04:46,597 --> 01:05:14,410
[SPEAKER_02]: let's move on just a few more stories before we get to the classic game of the week but this is an interesting meeting of the minds collaboration of the century we had the developers of Claire Obscure Expedition 33 visiting Square Enix and visiting the Final Fantasy dev offices as well for an exchange of ideas so collaborating with them and

766
01:05:15,048 --> 01:05:18,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Does this mean that we'll get a turn-based Final Fantasy game in the future?

767
01:05:19,314 --> 01:05:19,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully.

768
01:05:21,116 --> 01:05:24,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we can have the Claire Obscure folks put out a Final Fantasy game.

769
01:05:26,243 --> 01:05:33,612
[SPEAKER_07]: I would jump to that conclusion, but it is very interesting.

770
01:05:33,632 --> 01:05:35,875
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's very interesting that

771
01:05:36,226 --> 01:05:40,152
[SPEAKER_07]: with all the talk of this is what we want in our Final Fantasy.

772
01:05:40,432 --> 01:05:42,095
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what Final Fantasy should have been.

773
01:05:42,335 --> 01:05:44,378
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the direction that Final Fantasy should be going.

774
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:53,331
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's very interesting that they are meeting with them because it actually shows a willingness to listen on Square Enix's part.

775
01:05:53,732 --> 01:05:55,655
[SPEAKER_07]: That, to me, is the news.

776
01:05:55,675 --> 01:06:00,462
[SPEAKER_07]: Y'all need to stop with the jump into the, oh, they're going to collaborate, they're going to offer...

777
01:06:00,442 --> 01:06:03,006
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I mean, it's all wishful thinking.

778
01:06:03,026 --> 01:06:06,270
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not saying that to you, Loki, but, you know, just the internet in general.

779
01:06:06,290 --> 01:06:10,817
[SPEAKER_07]: But, I think it's just a show that Square Enix is willing to listen.

780
01:06:11,638 --> 01:06:16,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Which, hey, in this day and age, is a gift.

781
01:06:16,525 --> 01:06:19,129
[SPEAKER_07]: Because there's a lot of people out there who don't want to listen.

782
01:06:19,309 --> 01:06:22,694
[SPEAKER_02]: They also visited Kojima Productions as well.

783
01:06:23,075 --> 01:06:23,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

784
01:06:24,777 --> 01:06:25,478
[SPEAKER_07]: Just kind of cool.

785
01:06:25,498 --> 01:06:25,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

786
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:28,963
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder what they might be cooking up over there.

787
01:06:29,770 --> 01:06:38,203
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well, taking it back to a classic era in gaming, we have some news this week on a brand new Atari 2600+.

788
01:06:39,685 --> 01:06:47,256
[SPEAKER_07]: You might remember this was the retro console that came out last year, but the little, or maybe it was two years ago.

789
01:06:47,236 --> 01:06:48,018
[SPEAKER_07]: What is time?

790
01:06:48,078 --> 01:06:51,364
[SPEAKER_07]: Time is a construct that has lost all meaning.

791
01:06:51,385 --> 01:06:52,246
[SPEAKER_07]: Time is fleeting.

792
01:06:52,747 --> 01:06:53,549
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, that's right.

793
01:06:53,569 --> 01:06:55,533
[SPEAKER_07]: Madness definitely takes its toll.

794
01:06:55,613 --> 01:07:03,650
[SPEAKER_07]: But the 2600 Plus, it was a classic console, but it would actually play your Atari 2600 cartridges.

795
01:07:03,670 --> 01:07:05,734
[SPEAKER_07]: And I believe it plays your 50...

796
01:07:05,714 --> 01:07:07,055
[SPEAKER_07]: 200 and your 7800s.

797
01:07:07,095 --> 01:07:09,097
[SPEAKER_07]: It plays more as well.

798
01:07:09,658 --> 01:07:16,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they're coming out with a new 2600 plus that is all about Pac-Man.

799
01:07:16,624 --> 01:07:17,525
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know.

800
01:07:17,725 --> 01:07:20,528
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if I love the look of this thing.

801
01:07:20,768 --> 01:07:25,612
[SPEAKER_07]: But for those that are listening live, you can take a look at what this looks like there.

802
01:07:26,333 --> 01:07:27,274
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a yellow.

803
01:07:27,354 --> 01:07:27,714
[SPEAKER_07]: It's it.

804
01:07:27,734 --> 01:07:33,459
[SPEAKER_07]: Take that wooden concept of an Atari 2600 and make it yellow, which I just don't like.

805
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:35,061
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't like the color.

806
01:07:35,081 --> 01:07:35,181
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

807
01:07:35,161 --> 01:07:45,593
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah.

808
01:07:46,467 --> 01:07:50,733
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess that might be neat for people that missed it the first time around, but I'm not sure.

809
01:07:51,214 --> 01:07:52,255
[SPEAKER_07]: I love the look of it.

810
01:07:52,576 --> 01:07:54,959
[SPEAKER_07]: But it is celebrating 45 years of Pac-Man.

811
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:56,642
[SPEAKER_07]: It is coming out October 31st.

812
01:07:56,702 --> 01:08:02,169
[SPEAKER_07]: The price in British pounds is $128.09.

813
01:08:04,032 --> 01:08:06,556
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know what that's going to translate to over here.

814
01:08:06,576 --> 01:08:07,237
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe $129.99?

815
01:08:07,878 --> 01:08:08,318
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

816
01:08:09,380 --> 01:08:10,922
[SPEAKER_07]: It is...

817
01:08:10,902 --> 01:08:23,463
[SPEAKER_07]: Just the same as the basic model that came out previously, but it will have a Pac-Man themed joystick, also yellow, and a double feature Pac-Man Atari 7800 cartridge.

818
01:08:23,483 --> 01:08:34,641
[SPEAKER_07]: It has an all new arcade game, Pac-Man 7800, and it has the very first Pac-Man Atari 2600 as if anybody needs to revisit that.

819
01:08:35,062 --> 01:08:36,184
[SPEAKER_02]: No one wants to see that.

820
01:08:36,164 --> 01:08:40,112
[SPEAKER_07]: So, but that's kind of neat that it has both the reimagining.

821
01:08:40,373 --> 01:08:45,944
[SPEAKER_07]: There also are Ghost Edition wireless joysticks coming in the color of the various ghosts, which is kind of a cute idea.

822
01:08:46,626 --> 01:08:47,427
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, that's coming.

823
01:08:47,908 --> 01:08:49,872
[SPEAKER_07]: However, that's not really the news that caught my eye.

824
01:08:50,674 --> 01:08:53,700
[SPEAKER_07]: The news that did catch my eye was that Atari 50...

825
01:08:53,680 --> 01:09:02,988
[SPEAKER_07]: The retro collection that came out for the modern consoles a few years ago now at this point is getting yet more DLC.

826
01:09:03,329 --> 01:09:05,751
[SPEAKER_07]: This is after the Intellivision.

827
01:09:05,931 --> 01:09:07,733
[SPEAKER_07]: They had some other stuff recently.

828
01:09:07,753 --> 01:09:11,096
[SPEAKER_07]: Now they are getting a Namco Legendary Pack.

829
01:09:11,516 --> 01:09:14,959
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to tell the story about Atari and Namco's partnership.

830
01:09:15,380 --> 01:09:20,004
[SPEAKER_07]: And yes, Pac-Man for the Atari 2600 will be in this collection.

831
01:09:20,464 --> 01:09:20,884
[SPEAKER_07]: Fine.

832
01:09:21,185 --> 01:09:22,706
[SPEAKER_07]: Where that game belongs?

833
01:09:22,726 --> 01:09:23,687
[SPEAKER_07]: In a museum.

834
01:09:23,667 --> 01:09:25,811
[SPEAKER_07]: A virtual museum.

835
01:09:26,311 --> 01:09:28,495
[SPEAKER_02]: The 2600 plus is $169.99.

836
01:09:28,515 --> 01:09:31,500
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, thank you, tariffs.

837
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:33,203
[SPEAKER_02]: In the U.S.

838
01:09:33,483 --> 01:09:34,164
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, tariffs.

839
01:09:34,485 --> 01:09:34,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks.

840
01:09:35,226 --> 01:09:35,507
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

841
01:09:35,807 --> 01:09:38,431
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, where were we?

842
01:09:38,451 --> 01:09:38,672
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yes.

843
01:09:38,692 --> 01:09:42,759
[SPEAKER_07]: The Atari 2600, 5200, 7800 will all be represented.

844
01:09:42,839 --> 01:09:46,705
[SPEAKER_07]: Galaga, Dig Dug, Xevious, Galaxian.

845
01:09:46,685 --> 01:09:49,209
[SPEAKER_07]: All going to be represented in this, which I think is really cool.

846
01:09:49,429 --> 01:09:52,935
[SPEAKER_07]: I love this idea of the Namco collaboration.

847
01:09:53,015 --> 01:10:11,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, this leads to a lot of people, including myself, asking, could there be an Activision collaboration, which means a Microsoft collaboration, which I would think on the Xbox version of the game would be easy peasy, even though now there's their own Xbox Classics.

848
01:10:11,224 --> 01:10:13,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I got to come back to that in a minute.

849
01:10:14,393 --> 01:10:17,476
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be neat to see Activision represented at some point.

850
01:10:17,576 --> 01:10:21,000
[SPEAKER_07]: I just think the licensing is going to make that very difficult.

851
01:10:21,020 --> 01:10:21,901
[SPEAKER_07]: But never say never.

852
01:10:22,942 --> 01:10:26,046
[SPEAKER_07]: After all, you can play a lot of those games now on Xbox Classics.

853
01:10:26,226 --> 01:10:27,667
[SPEAKER_07]: But I will say this.

854
01:10:28,168 --> 01:10:33,414
[SPEAKER_07]: Microsoft is doing a terrible job supporting that Xbox Classics.

855
01:10:34,855 --> 01:10:37,198
[SPEAKER_07]: Show of hands in the room, everybody.

856
01:10:37,218 --> 01:10:43,945
[SPEAKER_07]: How many of you know that the legendary game Gabriel Knight is now accessible on Xbox Classics?

857
01:10:44,870 --> 01:10:53,445
[SPEAKER_07]: and DarkSakura.com.

858
01:10:54,775 --> 01:10:55,516
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

859
01:10:55,536 --> 01:10:55,796
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

860
01:10:56,057 --> 01:10:57,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Microsoft.

861
01:10:57,439 --> 01:10:59,161
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have an Xbox that I would play it on.

862
01:11:00,162 --> 01:11:06,591
[SPEAKER_07]: Gabriel Knight was a classic CD-ROM game by Sierra that had Tim Curry as one of the voices.

863
01:11:06,611 --> 01:11:10,316
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe had some other A-list actors involved in that game as well.

864
01:11:10,897 --> 01:11:13,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Gabriel Knight released on Xbox Classics.

865
01:11:13,380 --> 01:11:21,070
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, the publicity and the system behind that is so bad, it's not getting any coverage that these games are actually.

866
01:11:21,090 --> 01:11:24,715
[SPEAKER_07]: So it seems like they're adding new games maybe once a month.

867
01:11:24,695 --> 01:11:42,079
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

868
01:11:42,059 --> 01:12:11,526
[SPEAKER_07]: and that was before Gabriel Knight that was the last one with Cosmic Commander and some of the other releases this or Cosmic Commuter this time I didn't bother looking and I was just like I'm sure they're probably not because I should have seen I should have seen this somewhere else than actually just logging into the game on a whim and seeing oh they added Gabriel Knight at some point to Xbox Classics nobody's talking about it for what a legendary fucking game that is from the 90s so anyway

869
01:12:11,506 --> 01:12:13,268
[SPEAKER_07]: That was my tangent.

870
01:12:13,288 --> 01:12:16,191
[SPEAKER_07]: But the classic talk isn't done yet, right, DarkSakura?

871
01:12:16,992 --> 01:12:18,954
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go to the bump.

872
01:12:29,606 --> 01:12:36,934
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

873
01:12:37,395 --> 01:12:40,078
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for the classic game of the week.

874
01:12:41,712 --> 01:12:43,074
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn, Jamie, this game's old.

875
01:12:44,736 --> 01:12:46,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it is.

876
01:12:46,418 --> 01:12:46,858
[SPEAKER_05]: This is an old game.

877
01:12:48,140 --> 01:12:55,649
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I was specifically looking up vector games and I was like, oh yeah, this game existed and I haven't done it before.

878
01:12:56,370 --> 01:12:57,571
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's Omega Race.

879
01:12:58,813 --> 01:13:10,707
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a shooter that came out in 1981 designed by Ron Halliburton and it was released by Midway.

880
01:13:10,687 --> 01:13:18,459
[SPEAKER_05]: It was an arcade video game, and it was the only arcade vector graphic game that Midway created.

881
01:13:19,621 --> 01:13:20,563
[SPEAKER_05]: It had some ports.

882
01:13:20,583 --> 01:13:21,865
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll get into that for a bit.

883
01:13:22,806 --> 01:13:26,312
[SPEAKER_05]: But the way that the game is set is it's set in 2003!

884
01:13:26,672 --> 01:13:27,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah!

885
01:13:28,523 --> 01:13:49,232
[SPEAKER_05]: and you control an Omegan fighter spaceship to destroy enemy droid ships around a track and you use a spinner to control the ship and you have a button to thrust and a button to fire lasers and so the enemies that you destroy

886
01:13:50,663 --> 01:14:01,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Have to destroy or avoid, this is different ones you have, are drone ships, commander ships, two types of space mines, and shooting star ships.

887
01:14:01,234 --> 01:14:07,380
[SPEAKER_05]: And you bounce off an invisible barrier on the edge of the screen that briefly shows up when you're hit.

888
01:14:07,641 --> 01:14:13,366
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course you get extra ships, they're awarded at 40,000 points and 100,000 points respectively, by default.

889
01:14:14,468 --> 01:14:14,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

890
01:14:15,419 --> 01:14:18,506
[SPEAKER_05]: The port that came out... Alright, let me actually get into the port.

891
01:14:18,546 --> 01:14:24,399
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was ported to the VIC-20 in Commodore 64, published by Commodore in 1982.

892
01:14:24,459 --> 01:14:32,196
[SPEAKER_05]: In 1983, we had the ColecoVision and Atari 2600 versions that were released by CBS Electronics.

893
01:14:32,176 --> 01:14:46,416
[SPEAKER_05]: So the Atari 2600 version came with a booster grip controller that converted the button on the Atari CX-40 joystick into having separate buttons for thrusting and shooting.

894
01:14:48,138 --> 01:15:02,098
[SPEAKER_05]: It was also one of the few CBS games that came out on the 2600 that had an additional 256 bytes of RAM in each cartridge, and they called it RAM+.

895
01:15:02,078 --> 01:15:15,394
[SPEAKER_05]: The Consumer's Guide How to Win at Video Games stated that any unskilled player can pop a quarter into the machine and stay up there for up to 20,000 points.

896
01:15:17,696 --> 01:15:28,609
[SPEAKER_05]: They said that more than 35,000 machines were created and the average machine brings in $181 per week as of the publication in 1982.

897
01:15:28,589 --> 01:15:40,049
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was one of the best money-making machines at the time because it was deceptive and actually pretty frustrating.

898
01:15:41,912 --> 01:15:47,121
[SPEAKER_05]: Compute magazine called Omega Race, quote, a real winner for the VIC.

899
01:15:47,101 --> 01:15:49,344
[SPEAKER_05]: and that it was fast-paced.

900
01:15:50,005 --> 01:15:54,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, Byte Magazine said it was fast-paced, had colorful graphics and featured good sound effects.

901
01:15:55,371 --> 01:16:00,858
[SPEAKER_05]: The quote says Omega Race is a fun game that retains all the best characteristics of the arcade version.

902
01:16:01,559 --> 01:16:07,367
[SPEAKER_05]: Ahoy also called the VIC-20 version fairly faithful to the game and very exciting.

903
01:16:07,387 --> 01:16:14,796
[SPEAKER_05]: And it won a certificate of merit in the category Best Solitaire Computer Game at the 4th Annual ARKI Awards.

904
01:16:14,776 --> 01:16:20,503
[SPEAKER_05]: It was cloned for the TRS-80 Color Computer, a space race in 1982.

905
01:16:21,123 --> 01:16:23,806
[SPEAKER_05]: And now here's the fun one.

906
01:16:24,647 --> 01:16:32,216
[SPEAKER_05]: It was going to be... In fact, it was pitched for the Atari Jaguar as an update.

907
01:16:32,236 --> 01:16:34,358
[SPEAKER_05]: But it didn't get further than the proposal.

908
01:16:36,821 --> 01:16:39,905
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a document that exists about this.

909
01:16:39,925 --> 01:16:42,808
[SPEAKER_05]: It is in the hands of someone named...

910
01:16:43,463 --> 01:17:02,755
[SPEAKER_07]: Joe Corrale on Atariage and that's it that's Omega Race it's vector-tastic it is I'm trying to remember if I ever actually played this game because it does look super familiar I know I played this at some point but I'm like was it an actual arcade version or where I don't know

911
01:17:03,157 --> 01:17:04,058
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

912
01:17:04,619 --> 01:17:06,662
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, DarkTetsu just said what I was just thinking.

913
01:17:07,723 --> 01:17:13,251
[SPEAKER_05]: Could you imagine an updated multiplayer version of this sort of in the style of, say, Tempest 2000?

914
01:17:13,731 --> 01:17:16,215
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, that's kind of fun.

915
01:17:16,235 --> 01:17:17,637
[SPEAKER_03]: That's neat.

916
01:17:17,657 --> 01:17:19,019
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, great classic.

917
01:17:19,039 --> 01:17:25,407
[SPEAKER_05]: And SSU100 Matt adds, apparently there was a sight-down version in the arcade that was rare.

918
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:29,232
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

919
01:17:29,252 --> 01:17:31,155
[SPEAKER_05]: But this game is math.

920
01:17:32,603 --> 01:17:35,548
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

921
01:17:36,129 --> 01:17:37,772
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, definitely a classic pick there.

922
01:17:37,792 --> 01:17:40,035
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you, DarkSakura, for that pick.

923
01:17:40,757 --> 01:17:40,997
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

924
01:17:41,077 --> 01:17:45,985
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to get to some other headlines right now in a segment called Rapid Fire News.

925
01:17:46,005 --> 01:17:48,129
[SPEAKER_07]: Talk about some other things going on.

926
01:17:48,229 --> 01:17:50,072
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, why don't you start us off?

927
01:17:50,812 --> 01:17:58,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so starting things off, of course, we got some cool new games coming, homebrew games.

928
01:17:58,582 --> 01:18:07,915
[SPEAKER_02]: So Fallout Bakersfield, which is a Doom... I'm just imagining and it's making me laugh.

929
01:18:08,356 --> 01:18:10,879
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that a prequel or a sequel to Fallout Buttonwillow?

930
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:12,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Just wondering.

931
01:18:13,677 --> 01:18:42,621
[SPEAKER_02]: it is a non-commercial Doom 1993 total conversion built using GZ Doom and it's being worked on currently right now it's estimated to be out in 2027 but it looks pretty impressive so far definitely has Fallout 1 and 2 vibes which I think is supposed to be around the time period that takes place but yeah, Fallout Bakersfield look forward to that something exciting needs to happen there

932
01:18:43,630 --> 01:19:02,449
[SPEAKER_02]: and then we got the announcement of and I knew we knew it was coming but they finally showed off the set now and you can pre-order it but the Lego Game Boy which is I think almost a one-to-one model it's gonna retail for $60 and

933
01:19:02,429 --> 01:19:16,443
[SPEAKER_02]: and it basically comes with some mock cartridges for Zelda and Super Mario Land and it also has lenticular little displays that you can slide in there but it looks really cool.

934
01:19:16,463 --> 01:19:17,323
[SPEAKER_02]: It does.

935
01:19:18,364 --> 01:19:20,286
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's coming out October 1st.

936
01:19:21,447 --> 01:19:25,952
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's actual size and actually not super expensive so that's pretty good.

937
01:19:26,152 --> 01:19:27,934
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 60 bucks, that's not bad.

938
01:19:28,374 --> 01:19:30,837
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really not.

939
01:19:30,857 --> 01:19:32,318
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, DarkSakura.

940
01:19:33,648 --> 01:19:48,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Kusama, The Awakening, Orion the Orange

941
01:19:48,970 --> 01:20:09,223
[SPEAKER_05]: Nightlings, 1slash, Ito There's Blindsided Labs Some of these are actually both Mac PC and some of them are available for Steam Deck Some of the other games on the list is Blood Quest from Hell

942
01:20:10,267 --> 01:20:39,430
[SPEAKER_05]: Sinkers Space Ace but it is not the Space Ace this is a different game called Space Ace a 2D down top shooter it's a game called Hold Me Still where you're trying to investigate your friend's disappearance Tiris, Digging Dogs which looks really cute, Flush Fall which is a toilet battle royale Cube One versus Cube Two Track Racing, The Holy Rosary, Zombie Murder 3

943
01:20:39,983 --> 01:20:44,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Dreamlocked SRA

944
01:20:45,923 --> 01:20:49,027
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a few more on there.

945
01:20:49,308 --> 01:20:51,971
[SPEAKER_05]: Bling, Fortune Memories, Enflamed, Realm Runner.

946
01:20:52,773 --> 01:20:54,595
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.

947
01:20:55,056 --> 01:20:57,259
[SPEAKER_05]: The Population Must Grow, which is a city builder.

948
01:20:57,339 --> 01:20:58,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, that sounds like something up your alley.

949
01:20:59,061 --> 01:20:59,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

950
01:21:01,244 --> 01:21:07,653
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a game called A Pig Game, a Pee Wee premiere, and you play as a ceramic pig looking for toothpicks.

951
01:21:07,733 --> 01:21:08,655
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so cute.

952
01:21:09,436 --> 01:21:13,922
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Simple Zombie Survival, which looks like a PS1 game.

953
01:21:15,218 --> 01:21:16,320
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

954
01:21:17,501 --> 01:21:20,606
[SPEAKER_07]: Going to updates to the Nintendo Music app.

955
01:21:20,666 --> 01:21:25,192
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo Music got a pretty big drop of songs this week.

956
01:21:25,212 --> 01:21:29,798
[SPEAKER_07]: It's 26 new games from the NES and Famicom era.

957
01:21:29,818 --> 01:21:34,425
[SPEAKER_07]: I won't name them all, but essentially it's all of the black box release titles.

958
01:21:34,605 --> 01:21:41,074
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, things from like Clue Clue Land, Excitebike, Ice Climber, you know, sort of that initial launch era of games released.

959
01:21:41,054 --> 01:22:08,682
[SPEAKER_07]: Famicom, Mahjong, Gomoku, Narabe, Renju Devil World

960
01:22:08,662 --> 01:22:13,026
[SPEAKER_07]: and turning them into 10-hour loops, which is something you can do in the Nintendo Music app.

961
01:22:13,507 --> 01:22:25,899
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you want to go slowly crazy by listening to the Clu Clu Land background music over and over and over and over again while you work, you can do that thanks to your Nintendo Music app.

962
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:34,107
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, now let's check out some release dates of some games coming out all these years later after the Famicom's release.

963
01:22:34,828 --> 01:22:35,749
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's start in the U.S.

964
01:22:35,769 --> 01:22:37,150
[SPEAKER_07]: with release dates, Loki.

965
01:22:37,771 --> 01:22:45,365
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a game called One-Eyed Liko that is coming out on PC.

1014
01:28:12,546 --> 01:28:13,610

1019
01:28:23,776 --> 01:28:37,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so we have news now that apparently Station Eleven, their showrunner, is going to be leading the upcoming live-action series based on Wolfenstein.

1020
01:28:37,816 --> 01:28:47,269
[SPEAKER_02]: So the director of Fallout, because Fallout's done so well for itself, it's already garnered a second and now third season.

1021
01:28:47,249 --> 01:28:49,332
[SPEAKER_02]: But now they're like, hey, you know what?

1022
01:28:49,352 --> 01:28:50,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Fallout worked out.

1023
01:28:50,174 --> 01:28:51,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do Wolfenstein.

1024
01:28:51,536 --> 01:28:54,580
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now that's going to be a thing that's being worked on as well.

1025
01:28:55,482 --> 01:28:57,705
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll have to see how this turns out.

1026
01:28:57,725 --> 01:28:58,747
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm excited.

1027
01:28:58,787 --> 01:28:59,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Fallout was great.

1028
01:28:59,949 --> 01:29:01,111
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait for the season two.

1029
01:29:01,471 --> 01:29:03,274
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's later this year, actually.

1030
01:29:03,294 --> 01:29:05,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, lots of stuff happening on the TV front.

1031
01:29:06,038 --> 01:29:07,080
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to say something real quick.

1032
01:29:07,140 --> 01:29:11,687
[SPEAKER_05]: Madomodogatari, I should have known because it's the game that PioPio was based off of.

1033
01:29:12,089 --> 01:29:14,254
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, interesting.

1034
01:29:15,176 --> 01:29:15,397
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1035
01:29:15,918 --> 01:29:17,983
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and I'm a silly bean.

1036
01:29:18,003 --> 01:29:18,825
[SPEAKER_05]: I should have remembered that.

1037
01:29:20,248 --> 01:29:20,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1038
01:29:21,912 --> 01:29:24,378
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, don't let us get four of you in a row or you'll disappear.

1039
01:29:26,302 --> 01:29:26,723
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

1040
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:32,704
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been a hot minute since I played some Puyo Puyo.

1041
01:29:32,724 --> 01:29:33,326
[SPEAKER_07]: I should play it again.

1042
01:29:33,346 --> 01:29:38,976
[SPEAKER_07]: I know they have the Puyo Puyo in Tetris 2 on Switch 2 because that was very controversial because it's not a free upgrade.

1043
01:29:39,276 --> 01:29:42,001
[SPEAKER_07]: But I didn't own it on Switch 1, so, you know, whatever.

1044
01:29:42,723 --> 01:29:43,023
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

1045
01:29:43,043 --> 01:29:46,770
[SPEAKER_05]: You realize that right now I am literally looking at a Super Famicom copy of it.

1046
01:29:47,543 --> 01:30:00,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Curbys Avalanche

1047
01:30:02,512 --> 01:30:02,993
[SPEAKER_07]: I do love that game.

1048
01:30:03,013 --> 01:30:04,416
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what Puyo Da was, right?

1049
01:30:04,556 --> 01:30:08,384
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the dancing music game that came out on Dreamcast.

1050
01:30:08,684 --> 01:30:09,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1051
01:30:09,306 --> 01:30:10,107
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it was cute.

1052
01:30:10,368 --> 01:30:11,650
[SPEAKER_07]: It was cute.

1053
01:30:11,670 --> 01:30:12,732
[SPEAKER_03]: Wispy Woods.

1054
01:30:13,133 --> 01:30:17,983
[SPEAKER_03]: That was how they said it in Kirby's Avalanche.

1055
01:30:18,003 --> 01:30:18,985
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how they said it.

1056
01:30:18,965 --> 01:30:20,507
[SPEAKER_07]: Wispy Woods.

1057
01:30:20,607 --> 01:30:26,656
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get to the Lister Roundtable and invite you to do your Kirby impressions here on the show.

1058
01:30:26,756 --> 01:30:31,162
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to call us, you sure can on our Discord, vognetwork.com.

1059
01:30:31,663 --> 01:30:39,454
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, new feature on the VOG Network Discord server, we now have one of them cute little tags you can have by your name.

01:30:41,118 --> 01:30:55,570

[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1065
01:31:18,241 --> 01:31:21,306
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby says Rob's boost goes towards cleaner voice chat rooms.

1066
01:31:21,366 --> 01:31:21,967
[SPEAKER_07]: That is true.

1067
01:31:22,067 --> 01:31:24,651
[SPEAKER_07]: The original two went to having us as actual.

1068
01:31:25,172 --> 01:31:32,363
[SPEAKER_07]: And this whole little getup is a little bit cleaner and has better audio thanks to... I haven't seen a single cobweb.

1069
01:31:32,644 --> 01:31:33,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1070
01:31:33,986 --> 01:31:36,610
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the one thing I do keep clean, unlike the mailbox.

1071
01:31:36,590 --> 01:31:39,702
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of which, do we have an email this week?

1072
01:31:39,722 --> 01:31:39,782
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1073
01:31:39,802 --> 01:31:40,866
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't see any, but okay.

1074
01:31:41,248 --> 01:31:48,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Participate at OrangeSongsRadio.com if you wish to throw some things at Jamie to read in a future week.

1075
01:31:48,858 --> 01:32:09,938
[SPEAKER_07]: or if you want to keep sending me promo codes some of y'all are so nice and send me promo codes keep it up keep up the yes keep up the good work send Rob promo codes I'm very interested in free shit in Pokemon Go if you get any codes for that or you know any any good game I'll probably take them I appreciate it

1076
01:32:09,918 --> 01:32:17,011
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, how about any, oh yeah, S. Jonah Matt says, don't throw any actual things at Jamie unless they are tacos.

1077
01:32:17,412 --> 01:32:19,897
[SPEAKER_07]: And even then I would recommend a soft shell.

1078
01:32:20,498 --> 01:32:25,607
[SPEAKER_05]: Or a Garris Vicarian body pillow.

1079
01:32:25,627 --> 01:32:28,753
[SPEAKER_07]: What, you know, one of my friends had a birthday this last week.

1080
01:32:29,172 --> 01:32:32,737
[SPEAKER_07]: It might have been the same birthday as the Bobby Blackwolf show, actually, now that I think about it.

1081
01:32:32,757 --> 01:32:34,699
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, one of my friends had a birthday this weekend.

1082
01:32:34,719 --> 01:32:41,468
[SPEAKER_07]: He was texting me pictures today from the Mass Effect ride at Great America.

1083
01:32:41,528 --> 01:32:42,950
[SPEAKER_07]: He went to Great America for his birthday.

1084
01:32:43,551 --> 01:32:44,672
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to go!

1085
01:32:44,712 --> 01:32:48,517
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, I keep forgetting the Mass Effect ride exists, right?

1086
01:32:48,537 --> 01:32:50,460
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you would have thought they would have closed it years ago.

1087
01:32:50,840 --> 01:32:58,470
[SPEAKER_07]: But what caught my eye is that I was looking at the pictures and I was noticing that the host...

1088
01:32:59,260 --> 01:33:03,125
[SPEAKER_07]: Did not appear to be a guy.

1089
01:33:03,145 --> 01:33:05,868
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's not... What's his name?

1090
01:33:05,908 --> 01:33:10,454
[SPEAKER_07]: The fanboy from Mass Effect that usually is the mascot on the ride.

1091
01:33:10,734 --> 01:33:14,519
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, usually the person introduces themselves as Conrad.

1092
01:33:14,539 --> 01:33:17,062
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's a joke to the games.

1093
01:33:17,343 --> 01:33:19,125
[SPEAKER_07]: But I've never seen...

1094
01:33:19,662 --> 01:33:23,046
[SPEAKER_07]: A lady or theydy hosting the ride.

1095
01:33:23,246 --> 01:33:24,488
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know.

1096
01:33:24,808 --> 01:33:27,051
[SPEAKER_07]: But it does look like this picture is so far back.

1097
01:33:27,091 --> 01:33:30,535
[SPEAKER_07]: But now that I'm looking at it, they might have green skin.

1098
01:33:31,015 --> 01:33:34,799
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm wondering... I'm wondering if it's just weird lighting.

1099
01:33:34,820 --> 01:33:38,344
[SPEAKER_05]: The sorry lady that turned green from the Dorian?

1100
01:33:38,644 --> 01:33:39,765
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder if it's that.

1101
01:33:39,785 --> 01:33:40,306
[SPEAKER_05]: What was her name?

1102
01:33:40,566 --> 01:33:41,507
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I asked.

1103
01:33:41,527 --> 01:33:42,729
[SPEAKER_07]: I said, wait a minute.

1104
01:33:42,829 --> 01:33:44,591
[SPEAKER_07]: Who did she introduce herself as?

1105
01:33:44,651 --> 01:33:46,012
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that's not Conrad.

1106
01:33:46,353 --> 01:33:48,235
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the first time I've seen...

1107
01:33:49,109 --> 01:33:51,416
[SPEAKER_07]: A different gender up front.

1108
01:33:51,436 --> 01:33:55,127
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was like, what did he couldn't remember?

1109
01:33:55,990 --> 01:33:56,531
[SPEAKER_05]: Shiala.

1110
01:33:56,812 --> 01:33:57,454
[SPEAKER_05]: That was her name.

1111
01:33:58,537 --> 01:33:59,580
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I wonder.

1112
01:33:59,721 --> 01:34:03,793
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder if that's like the the other character they can have.

1113
01:34:05,208 --> 01:34:22,928
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, very random, but just a reminder to those, if you go through the Bay Area, you have maybe, I don't know, they're saying, they're threatening like two years left to go check out that ride before they close Great America forever and turn it into condos because billionaires are terrible people.

1114
01:34:24,170 --> 01:34:24,891
[SPEAKER_05]: I want a taco now.

1115
01:34:24,911 --> 01:34:28,955
[SPEAKER_07]: Except for Dolly Parton, who might not actually be a billionaire.

1116
01:34:29,055 --> 01:34:29,436
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure.

1117
01:34:29,456 --> 01:34:30,557
[SPEAKER_07]: Is Dolly Parton a billionaire?

1118
01:34:31,482 --> 01:34:34,205
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure, but I mean... She's excluded.

1119
01:34:34,245 --> 01:34:39,290
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some ethical people out there, but she also does a lot of good with her money.

1120
01:34:39,310 --> 01:34:44,775
[SPEAKER_07]: When the billionaires... She's just a billionaire with karma.

1121
01:34:45,676 --> 01:34:50,521
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a few other folks out there who use their money for good.

1122
01:34:51,762 --> 01:34:55,566
[SPEAKER_07]: To be fair, Bill Gates does a lot of good stuff with his money.

1123
01:34:55,706 --> 01:34:56,367
[SPEAKER_07]: More than most.

1124
01:34:57,128 --> 01:34:58,469
[SPEAKER_02]: That's on Trey Parker.

1125
01:34:59,330 --> 01:34:59,430
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1126
01:35:03,764 --> 01:35:04,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, $500 million.

1127
01:35:05,246 --> 01:35:08,469
[SPEAKER_05]: Still, that's probably because she's giving away a bunch of money.

1128
01:35:08,969 --> 01:35:15,816
[SPEAKER_07]: The funniest thing about that South Park was before that little AI thing was shown, and y'all know what I'm talking about.

1129
01:35:16,417 --> 01:35:18,339
[SPEAKER_07]: It said one of 50.

1130
01:35:18,519 --> 01:35:19,881
[SPEAKER_07]: Of 50, yeah.

1131
01:35:19,901 --> 01:35:28,169
[SPEAKER_07]: And they renewed for 50 episodes, which makes me think they're gonna do this shit every single week.

1132
01:35:29,330 --> 01:35:29,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Which...

1133
01:35:31,355 --> 01:35:39,772
[SPEAKER_07]: I never thought I would be sitting here going, South Park is really funny, but everything from the 90s is back, I guess.

1134
01:35:41,816 --> 01:35:48,390
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, then people want to say, oh, well, South Park only wasn't funny because they were making fun of liberals.

1135
01:35:48,410 --> 01:35:50,674
[SPEAKER_07]: South Park has always made fun of everybody.

1136
01:35:50,694 --> 01:35:53,059
[SPEAKER_07]: It just got to a point where it was like...

1137
01:35:53,039 --> 01:35:54,162
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, it was just so much.

1138
01:35:54,242 --> 01:35:59,414
[SPEAKER_05]: But now they're making fun of the Republican bros.

1139
01:35:59,575 --> 01:36:01,339
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't like it anymore.

1140
01:36:01,479 --> 01:36:05,409
[SPEAKER_07]: They're pushing an envelope that hasn't really been pushed in a long time.

1141
01:36:06,190 --> 01:36:07,453
[SPEAKER_07]: It needs to happen.

1142
01:36:08,356 --> 01:36:09,799
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm hoping for an aneurysm.

1143
01:36:12,766 --> 01:36:25,211
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't say who, I didn't say when, I didn't say anything.

1144
01:36:25,973 --> 01:36:29,560
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just hoping for an aneurysm.

1145
01:36:29,540 --> 01:36:31,322
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have a joke about that.

1146
01:36:31,722 --> 01:36:32,503
[SPEAKER_07]: He was pretty metal.

1147
01:36:32,563 --> 01:36:36,728
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Ozzy Osbourne, of course, Malcolm Jamal Warner passed away.

1148
01:36:36,748 --> 01:36:39,932
[SPEAKER_07]: And I said, you know, these death things, they usually come in threes.

1149
01:36:40,152 --> 01:36:42,495
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think for a minute there, we were all thinking.

1150
01:36:42,515 --> 01:36:44,036
[SPEAKER_07]: I said, no, I don't have to say the name.

1151
01:36:44,317 --> 01:36:45,458
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have to say anything.

1152
01:36:46,159 --> 01:36:48,381
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, the room's laughing, giggle, giggle, giggle.

1153
01:36:49,042 --> 01:36:55,569
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I said, and then we all realized we need to be more specific because God took the wrong racist.

1154
01:36:55,970 --> 01:36:56,070
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1155
01:37:00,404 --> 01:37:03,028
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, moving on.

1156
01:37:03,288 --> 01:37:08,955
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I believe I ended that joke with, and if that joke is too soon for you, too bad, brother.

1157
01:37:10,277 --> 01:37:10,598
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1158
01:37:11,078 --> 01:37:16,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and DT also points out that the Ozzy concert with Black Sabbath raised a lot of money for charity, and yes.

1159
01:37:17,367 --> 01:37:18,849
[SPEAKER_07]: It did, yeah.

1160
01:37:19,810 --> 01:37:21,092
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to joke about Ozzy.

1161
01:37:21,452 --> 01:37:25,578
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it's metal as fuck that the first thing Ozzy does when he dies is murder Hulk Hogan.

1162
01:37:25,698 --> 01:37:27,981
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, this is so metal.

1163
01:37:29,075 --> 01:37:37,645
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to go back and say another thing, because I actually said the same thing about when my dad passed, is that it's all something that he brought on himself.

1164
01:37:40,067 --> 01:37:47,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, for my dad, it was lots and lots of drugs and alcohol when he was younger, and probably for Hogan, it was very similar, compounded with roids.

1165
01:37:47,996 --> 01:37:48,957
[SPEAKER_05]: You know?

1166
01:37:48,997 --> 01:37:50,819
[SPEAKER_05]: Still taking them.

1167
01:37:51,320 --> 01:37:53,142
[SPEAKER_07]: Rough week to have done cocaine in the 80s.

1168
01:37:53,542 --> 01:37:54,023
[SPEAKER_07]: Rough week.

1169
01:37:55,124 --> 01:37:56,145
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, yep, yep.

1170
01:37:58,032 --> 01:38:03,314
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, let's see.

1171
01:38:03,334 --> 01:38:06,608
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to ask if we had any last minute stories, Loki.

1172
01:38:07,043 --> 01:38:08,384
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, we do.

1173
01:38:09,265 --> 01:38:16,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony is hiring a new role, which is the Senior Director of Multi-Platform and Account Management.

1174
01:38:16,371 --> 01:38:18,293
[SPEAKER_02]: What does that job do, you may ask?

1175
01:38:19,434 --> 01:38:37,050
[SPEAKER_02]: They specifically say that it will play a critical leadership role in shaping and executing the global commercial strategy for PlayStation Studios software titles across all digital platforms beyond PlayStation hardware, including Steam, Epic Game Store, Xbox, Nintendo, and mobile.

1176
01:38:37,030 --> 01:38:41,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, the games are not going to be platform specific anymore.

1177
01:38:41,935 --> 01:38:43,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the world's coming to an end.

1178
01:38:44,979 --> 01:38:48,963
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yeah, obviously they're going to try doing that and pivot that way because they can make more money.

1179
01:38:50,445 --> 01:38:51,846
[SPEAKER_02]: So, too bad, fanboys.

1180
01:38:54,669 --> 01:38:55,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1181
01:38:55,530 --> 01:38:57,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else?

1182
01:38:57,472 --> 01:39:04,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, if you enjoyed the game that had behind me during this live stream, which is Boltgun, I have a free key for you because unfortunately they

1183
01:39:04,942 --> 01:39:10,911
[SPEAKER_02]: You pick it up and then all of a sudden it becomes part of a bundle that you get.

1184
01:39:11,733 --> 01:39:12,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Free key.

1185
01:39:12,334 --> 01:39:13,916
[SPEAKER_07]: Free Steam key for Boltgun.

1186
01:39:13,976 --> 01:39:14,577
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a great game.

1187
01:39:14,657 --> 01:39:15,499
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that looks fun.

1188
01:39:15,779 --> 01:39:16,120
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1189
01:39:16,140 --> 01:39:20,707
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, holler out in chat if you're the one to redeem it so we know it got redeemed.

1190
01:39:20,727 --> 01:39:29,160
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you want more instant freebies like that, check out live as we broadcast Sunday nights, 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific.

1191
01:39:29,140 --> 01:39:32,723
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, with that, I think we're going to move to wrap it up for the night.

1192
01:39:33,204 --> 01:39:35,025
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to go around and get final thoughts.

1193
01:39:35,065 --> 01:39:37,187
[SPEAKER_07]: But first, I want to thank you for listening to Orange Launch Radio.

1194
01:39:37,548 --> 01:39:39,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for checking out our show.

1195
01:39:39,589 --> 01:39:42,472
[SPEAKER_07]: We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.

1196
01:39:42,792 --> 01:39:46,716
[SPEAKER_07]: So tell a friend or two about the show, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

1197
01:39:47,597 --> 01:39:53,182
[SPEAKER_07]: If you liked what you heard, a nice five-star review on a site like Apple Podcasts, YouTube, Spotify, wherever it is you found this show.

1198
01:39:53,202 --> 01:39:55,484
[SPEAKER_07]: It goes an awful long way, and we really appreciate it.

1199
01:39:56,465 --> 01:39:59,147
[SPEAKER_07]: With that, we'll get everybody's final thoughts.

1200
01:39:59,127 --> 01:40:00,569
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, we'll go to you.

1201
01:40:01,110 --> 01:40:02,953
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you're streaming tonight, yes?

1202
01:40:04,595 --> 01:40:08,821
[SPEAKER_05]: I am, I am, and I'm trying to get my stupid avatar hands to make a heart.

1203
01:40:09,182 --> 01:40:10,443
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll just do this one instead.

1204
01:40:11,966 --> 01:40:12,366
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.

1205
01:40:12,927 --> 01:40:15,991
[SPEAKER_05]: So, at any rate... Congrats, OrangeRite, got the code.

1206
01:40:16,632 --> 01:40:17,233
[SPEAKER_07]: Congrats.

1207
01:40:17,253 --> 01:40:19,136
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, congratulations.

1208
01:40:19,276 --> 01:40:26,486
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to be playing Mass Effect 2, and I've got some announcements to make, so, you know, stick around.

1209
01:40:27,248 --> 01:40:27,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

1210
01:40:27,983 --> 01:40:38,240
[SPEAKER_05]: But I am going to be working out when I can actually throw in another ballet class and still keep my stream schedule.

1211
01:40:39,122 --> 01:40:39,823
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm stupid.

1212
01:40:43,308 --> 01:40:44,050
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1213
01:40:45,292 --> 01:40:46,233
[SPEAKER_03]: I will see you next time.

1214
01:40:46,253 --> 01:40:47,495
[SPEAKER_03]: Have fun, everybody.

1215
01:40:47,515 --> 01:40:47,776
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1216
01:40:47,796 --> 01:40:48,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye-bye.

1217
01:40:49,098 --> 01:40:49,819
Bye.

1218
01:40:50,801 --> 01:40:52,063
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, that takes us to you then.

1219
01:40:52,083 --> 01:40:53,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Your final thought tonight.

1220
01:40:53,718 --> 01:40:56,201
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you didn't get a key, it is half off right now on Steam as well.

1221
01:40:56,361 --> 01:40:58,123
[SPEAKER_02]: So, just letting you know.

1222
01:40:58,143 --> 01:40:59,645
[SPEAKER_02]: You can pick it up for $10.99.

1223
01:41:01,587 --> 01:41:08,175
[SPEAKER_02]: My final thought is, hopefully I can get to finishing my data pack this week.

1224
01:41:08,355 --> 01:41:09,537
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been saying that every week.

1225
01:41:09,557 --> 01:41:13,581
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been taking a very long time, but it is a very complex thing that I'm doing for the first time.

1226
01:41:13,601 --> 01:41:18,127
[SPEAKER_02]: So, that'll be... Yeah, it's going to be tricky.

1227
01:41:18,147 --> 01:41:19,829
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I'm looking forward to getting that done.

1228
01:41:19,869 --> 01:41:21,270
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be fun.

1229
01:41:21,691 --> 01:41:22,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Make good content.

1230
01:41:23,722 --> 01:41:29,169
[SPEAKER_07]: My final thought is Alan is going to be out of town for like four days for work.

1231
01:41:29,569 --> 01:41:31,632
[SPEAKER_07]: So good thing Oreo likes to cuddle.

1232
01:41:31,932 --> 01:41:34,275
[SPEAKER_07]: I love my cats.

1233
01:41:34,295 --> 01:41:34,635
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1234
01:41:35,056 --> 01:41:37,599
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going to do it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.

1235
01:41:37,619 --> 01:41:38,200
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much.

1236
01:41:38,240 --> 01:41:40,042
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be back next week to do it all over again.

1237
01:41:40,502 --> 01:41:41,464
[SPEAKER_07]: Until then, good night.

1238
01:41:43,526 --> 01:41:45,969
[SPEAKER_10]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1239
01:41:48,072 --> 01:41:51,636
[SPEAKER_10]: Orange Lounge Radio is a production of OLR Studios.

1240
01:41:53,067 --> 01:42:00,415

01:42:01,977 --> 01:42:11,588
