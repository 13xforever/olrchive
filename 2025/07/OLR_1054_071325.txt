[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is Orange Lounge Radio.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're live once again tonight, July the 13th of 2025, episode number 1054 of our show.
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Rob Roberts.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm here with you every week to talk about video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, gaming recipes, gaming movies, gaming gossip.
[SPEAKER_07]: What else?
[SPEAKER_07]: What else, DarkSakura?
[SPEAKER_07]: The one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
[SPEAKER_07]: What else am I missing?
[SPEAKER_07]: Gaming... Gaming... Ballet moves?
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, DarkSakura, you have a hard Discord on mute.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can see the icon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you're fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, why isn't she helping me out?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say gaming games.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, gaming games, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: and strategies and ballet games, which I think there's like three.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Gaming strategies.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: My favorite band is a code in Akari Warriors, ABBA.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a code you can use in Akari Warriors.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a gaming strategy for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gaming pinball table sucks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I heard the pinball table's not good, but they didn't have it at Southern Friday.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not that it's not good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just it's not great.
[SPEAKER_07]: They didn't... When I went to Southern Fry, they didn't have that.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was one pinball table I was hoping to see.
[SPEAKER_07]: But they did have that Elton John table.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_07]: I did like that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I fucking love Elton John.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like... I would love one of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was so much fun when I could hear it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it was... They had that thing on full blast at Southern Fry, and I enjoyed that table a lot.
[SPEAKER_07]: I noticed that Jersey Jack tends to make these very, like, lights...
[SPEAKER_07]: Show, Fireworks, they do the light show type of pinball tables, and I'm all for it, quite frankly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a couple of Jersey Jacks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we have Lord of the Rings.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lord of the Rings was Jersey Jack, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have Pirates of the Caribbean.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a couple of the Jersey Jack ones.
[SPEAKER_07]: Love that.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, and gaming pinball.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sadly, they have descended into madness.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's say hello as well to the one and only Techmaster Loki.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, we don't talk to you about pinball a lot.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you like pinball?
[SPEAKER_06]: I still have that pinball table that I'm building that I... That's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's been a year.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been a year since I got it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's been like a very long time since I've worked on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just because it's so big and messy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's sitting on the DDR machine right now, the kit.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do need to go back to it, assuming that it's not all destroyed.
[SPEAKER_07]: What was the last time you played that DDR machine?
[SPEAKER_07]: I know not during this summer.
[SPEAKER_06]: A long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been a while.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I played it, I think, last year.
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't played it this year.
[SPEAKER_06]: Certainly not any time now because it's incredibly hot in the garage.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's been a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: A friend of ours on... Hey, I was going to say, talk to Dan because we put up a split in our garage and that thing stays Arctic and it wasn't that bad.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, if I do anything in the garage, I'd be building an office in there so I can do streaming without people coming into the kitchen and screaming and yelling and microwaves and air fryers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Extra talk to Dan about that because we have a really, really good mini split.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: And gaming garage tips.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we insulated our garage to build our arcade.
[SPEAKER_07]: Gaming central air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, hello to those This is the BGHVAC channel For all of your video game HVAC needs We also do pipe cleans and duct cleans We love to talk about And we use that microscope thing that we set down the thing to see if you've got spiders We love to talk about sucking and blowing here on Orange Saunders Radio Of course we're talking about air Anyway Talk about the gaming industry She does
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gone from suck to blow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Commenting live on the show, of course, all of you in our chat room because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's Voice of Geeks Network, 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby Blackwolf was back tonight after his little vacay last week because he was working hard up in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura
[SPEAKER_07]: and actually no, but he takes his time for all those lovely people to donate.
[SPEAKER_03]: What about being a slow walker?
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, so congrats to Bobby and everybody at GameStone Quick.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we have a story later on it, but I think y'all know they raised like over 2 million bucks, which is great.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll talk more about that later in the show.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, kudos to VOG Zone, Bobby Blackwolf, who was a part of all that that went down up last week in Minneapolis and online everywhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Big thanks to those of you that are live in our chat room.
[SPEAKER_07]: S2100 Matt says he's a speed reader for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I did see that one donation that was posted to our Discord that I think was during a Super Metroid run where he did do speed reading.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess that comment can stand.
[SPEAKER_07]: I will not be striking that comment from the record after all.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
[SPEAKER_07]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
[SPEAKER_06]: Another piracy website went down for the Nintendo Switch because, you know, they're always combating piracy.
[SPEAKER_06]: So NSW2U is one of the, I guess, I don't know, more popular ROM sites for the Switch.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, but apparently it has been captured by the FBI, according to the domain now known
[SPEAKER_06]: Popping up a website has been seized page.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, yeah, that's... That's it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of makes sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop pirating your games because now the FBI is coming after you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do it less of a flashy way instead of having a big public website that everybody can see and expect it not to go down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, it's... I mean, that's just...
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever, but Yes, I'm sure that has ended piracy for good now, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure that taking down this one website in no way will ever cause the Switch piracy scene to come back.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been completely defeated at this point.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, yeah, I mean, obviously, I don't endorse piracy of new stuff and things that are on the market.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know there are people trying to sort of like defend what was going on as sort of like a, God, what's the defense they usually use about pirating the new games?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it game preservation?
[SPEAKER_07]: But that doesn't make any sense if a lot of these games are still for sale.
[SPEAKER_03]: Corporate sabotage, I'm down for that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I guess, but hearing about all the layoffs that happen in the industry, unfortunately the wrong people are never held accountable when games don't sell well.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm not a fan of piracy of current stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, if we're talking about, if this were a news article about a Nintendo 64 ROM website got shut down, I'd be a little more like, what the hell?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because these games are not actively making money and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: but we know that does still happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo of course being one of the most litigious but you were going to say Loki?
[SPEAKER_06]: There was one recently it wasn't like it was an indie game essentially so what it was is it was a beat-em-up game that was being done I
[SPEAKER_06]: I still can't play it without the chipsets.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a special retroarch thing that they built.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've emulated it?
[SPEAKER_03]: they finally have emulated it?
[SPEAKER_06]: they did and I mean if I don't know where you would find it on the internet maybe if someone archived it somewhere on a website with an app named for the internet archive organizational website are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to say this every version that I have attempted because I really wanted to play Paprium has been non-functional
[SPEAKER_03]: it's mostly functional from what I've heard now someone was selling theirs for like 800 bucks at CalX last year hmm
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike Deft in chat brings up an interesting perspective saying a phrase I always hear when trying to justify piracy and specifically, especially for Nintendo stuff, excuse me, is it's morally correct to pirate Nintendo.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I don't know about that statement, but I do remember the perspective that Mike Deft lives in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_07]: And from what I recall, and please correct me if I'm wrong, it's hard for me to keep tabs on every country in the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if I recall, there was a big hubaloo because Nintendo does not have an official distribution presence in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_07]: Therefore, everything in Mexico is way more expensive when it comes to the games.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it brings back to mind a sort of similar feeling I used to have in the PlayStation era.
[SPEAKER_07]: When, you know, when I would pirate DDR games, and I didn't, I would buy, I would buy the ones they made for the US, I bought Konami, I bought US Mix, I bought Beatmania.
[SPEAKER_07]: But when it came to like DDR, third mix, fourth mix, I pirated those and I did not apologize for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because my perspective was, if, if Konami wanted me to buy those games, they would release them here in the US.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I do understand music licenses probably made some of that stuff difficult.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a better understanding of some of that now than I did then.
[SPEAKER_07]: But
[SPEAKER_07]: I still would support DDR where I could when it was legally available for me to do so.
[SPEAKER_06]: We bought the PC version.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, come on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_06]: How much more can we support?
[SPEAKER_07]: We supported the Mr. Spanky DLC, okay?
[SPEAKER_07]: How many people can say that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike Deft in chat says, a Switch 2 with Mario Kart is almost $800 US dollars, maybe around $750.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I kind of...
[SPEAKER_07]: I get it a little more from that perspective because it's like that's not fair that they should have to pay twice as much as we do in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_07]: just because they don't have an official distribution system there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I understand where that gets a little bit trickier and probably where some of the justification for websites like this start to pop up.
[SPEAKER_07]: However, if you are going to justify your piracy –
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
[SPEAKER_07]: I say in Deft's case, and people like Deft, like, you never had the opportunity to fairly buy the game anyway.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it is a different argument in that case.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and I mean, and even saying that you should feel responsible for some of that, I don't, I mean, piracy isn't even enough to make a dent in game sales, I think, for the most part.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I wouldn't feel bad about it, honestly.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it just... Especially with just how they're treating the industry with their pricing and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Certainly, they're trying.
[SPEAKER_06]: They feel that they've earned this goodwill that they're going to now exploit and see what they can do to drum up more profits, but it's...
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think if it's fairly priced and it's more convenient, like with Steam and stuff like that, it's a no-brainer.
[SPEAKER_06]: A perfect example, look at how many games I've purchased on Steam that I don't even play, but I purchased them anyways because they look interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's that kind of on-a-whim impulse buying that that platform lends itself to.
[SPEAKER_06]: an $80 game is not going to be an impulse buy for me so like it really needs to be good and that's the thing is a lot of these games and a lot of these you know studios looking to keep pushing that retail cost of that game up okay but my standards for your game are going to be a lot higher than every time you bump that price up my standards for what that game needs to be is going to be incredibly high and if we find that you just don't
[SPEAKER_06]: Live up to those standards, then yeah, your games are going to fail.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there's a story we have we're going to be talking about a little bit about game delays and the whole thing with that, but one of the things that the complaints on there is like, well, yeah, but the previous game didn't do well, and it's these people's fault for that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like, well, yeah, but if you look at what the complaints were on that previous game, it was the monetization in it, not the actual game itself.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was how you shoved monetization in, and that was the publisher's.
[SPEAKER_07]: Charged $70 for a free-to-play game.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've definitely heard that before.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, or, you know, there's...
[SPEAKER_06]: There's games that have spent $800 million to be developed and still not done yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's that type of stuff too.
[SPEAKER_07]: I realize people have strong feelings on this issue.
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, I don't endorse piracy of current stuff for most people.
[SPEAKER_07]: I do try to understand the different angles because I also recognize it's a part of our industry we have to deal with.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we have to kind of figure out, I think if you want to get down to, you know, trying to be successful in the industry, you have to get down to the reasons of why do people do this.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, I think we just talked about one when it comes to the international folks, for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, some of the, you know, distribution and, you know, do games, are they, you know, affordable, you know, based on local, you know, economies and so forth.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I think, you know, there's,
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there are some people out there, though, that just pirate because they're trying to build up an impressive collection of stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they have the means and whatever to support otherwise, and they are actively hurting the industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think game companies have to kind of think about how do they get around that.
[SPEAKER_07]: and they try with things that are happening on the Switch too.
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, we have a story coming up later.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't mean to make this whole thing a teaser for later in the show, but it is what's going on this week that may be where that whole system is backfiring in a really bad way.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's just, it's...
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not something you can look away from and it will disappear.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's something that's always going to be there.
[SPEAKER_07]: We kind of have to figure out how do we live with this and how do we make people choose to do things the way that will make these companies money.
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess maybe the best analogy I could give is Napster.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody used to download, well, not everybody, but most people used to download music all the time on Napster, MP3s, just albums, you name it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it wasn't until the record companies kind of figured out how to legitimize that sort of immediacy of Napster and a one-click purchase system, which really, I believe iTunes was the first to do that, that once, I know once iTunes became available, I used that and I stopped using Napster.
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the file stuff, but viruses are written per system.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I guess that's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, when you have, at the time, a small user base, no one on a Mac was worried.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't download executables.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: But...
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just trying to make the point that it's like when this piracy was rampant everywhere, the industry sort of had to figure out how to embrace that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And maybe to the point we were talking about earlier, maybe there needs to be a better system of worldwide distribution.
[SPEAKER_07]: However, I keep contradicting myself tonight because we live in that kind of world.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't blame anybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: for not trying to do distribution worldwide in a system that involves the US at this point in time because of everything fucky going on with tariffs and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what a mess.
[SPEAKER_07]: What a mess.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like we said, this both sucks and blows.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're getting it all back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uncontrollably.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let's talk about our gaming week.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what were the types of video games that we were playing this week?
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, we'll start with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mass Effect, and Dead by Daylight, and Palia.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And believe it or not, I am going to have to become more of a gym rat.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will try to find ways to gamify my workouts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if anyone has ideas apart from using Nerd Fitness, let me know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to gamify my working out because I have to start doing one-sided deadlifts with a 50-pound kettlebell and I don't have a 50-pound kettlebell.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really have a lot of advice except the one you already know, which is closing my Apple Rings.
[SPEAKER_07]: I do that one.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I've been going to the gym a couple times.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not a lot, but a couple times.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I try to make sure I close my rings.
[SPEAKER_03]: I work out at home.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, of course, go to ballet.
[SPEAKER_03]: but and this is just more of like a life thing but you know I have that injury to my leg and I had been sitting down and doing a lot more gaming because I couldn't get up and really do a lot of stuff until I started physical therapy but now he says that I'm getting a lot stronger and I only have one more appointment left to do oh nice great yeah so I'm looking for I want to start actually doing the Pikmin thing since I downloaded it I just need a walking buddy not in this heat
[SPEAKER_03]: Call me in September.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll walk inside an air-conditioned mall like the old folks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why mall walking is legit.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know why mall walking is associated with old people.
[SPEAKER_07]: Try living in Phoenix or here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, mall walking works.
[SPEAKER_03]: We should do an 80s-style mall walk and everyone be all 80s.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like I've seen that on TikTok.
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a club that does that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably not here, but that does the 80s-style mall walking.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would be so down yeah all right S2100 Matt says I went mall walking today see it's still still a good thing all right uh Loki I think it's your turn um well I just played Minecraft this week I put together a big giant arena a battle arena type thing uh so that was like over 100,000 block build or something like that so I got that done and now I am working on developing uh
[SPEAKER_06]: Mob Waves that you would fight in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So kind of working with command blocks and stuff like that and designing what that's going to be and balancing all that stuff out.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's what I've been working on this week.
[SPEAKER_06]: That and, you know, between all that watching stuff on Summer Games so quick.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have a particular run you really enjoyed?
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the Bellator run.
[SPEAKER_06]: I watched that where they did like eight different decks or whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was interesting to see them play that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, my game of the week.
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of still on the ones I've been playing a lot recently.
[SPEAKER_07]: Diablo 4, Season 9 is continuing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I did hit level 60 and I'm in the Paragon levels now.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm up to about Paragon 30.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just got to Torment 1, so just working on my character for the season and trying to unlock all the silly things that I like to do in that game.
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, a little bit of Final Fantasy XIV, but just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I'm just kind of at the point where I'm waiting for the next patch, to be quite honest.
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I'm just waiting for the next expansion to be quite real.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know a nice way to say this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Dawn Trail has just kind of been a bit of a flop.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the bar for Final Fantasy XIV is also very high.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just think that game has been so good for so long that it's not that...
[SPEAKER_07]: Dawn Trail is necessarily like a bad game it's just bad for this game um and it just it hasn't it hasn't really lured me back in the way most of the other expansions did to be quite honest um but there's still I'm still paying for a sub so I still am signing in occasionally to try to get an upgrade to the house I'm still trying to get my crafting to 100 and at some point I'll want to get all my jobs up to 100 but I'm just kind of waiting for the rest of the systems to
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob, after five minutes, were you like, let's get it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, but then, uh, let's see.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've also been playing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, but you know, I have been, I've been speaking of emulation and all that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have been living it up and my dolphin emulator playing fantasy star online.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm playing fantasy star online game cube, uh, via the emulator.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, there's a server that you can connect to for that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've been playing with friends just a little bit, uh,
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
[SPEAKER_07]: I beat all the forests, I beat the dragon and now I'm working on the caves and god those quests get so much longer once you get to the caves because of the fact that those rooms just constantly spawn those fucking shark things over and over and over and over again but yeah PSO is still fun 20 years actually more than 20 years after that because the original was 25 years ago probably so I'm thinking about the GameCube version but yeah
[SPEAKER_07]: PSO for life literally um I think that's about that's about it fantasy life I'm gonna finish that hopefully in the coming days all right uh we are going to get into some more news we got a lot of gaming headlines for you so let's get to it Loki what is on deck for gaming news tonight
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I'll go for a walk I feel happy
[SPEAKER_06]: their funding obviously was pulled for their game and it was cancelled but they're now looking for other studio partners to work with to develop stuff so that's good and maybe at least the game will get brought back in another studio or something like that or maybe they can spin it into something, who knows but at the very least Romero Games is not closed so that's good that's good
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's very good but are they gonna so if the funding for their game got cut are they still gonna be able to release that though?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: They said the project funding was pulled and their game was cancelled.
[SPEAKER_06]: It says, due to confidentiality agreements, we cannot disclose the publisher's identity, though some may infer from the public information.
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: It says, as a result, we have now had to reassess our entire staffing from our studio.
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember, our game does not close, and we're doing everything in our power to ensure that it does not come to that.
[SPEAKER_06]: and any suggestion otherwise is factually incorrect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting, except, you know, so it's like this game you know nothing about had something happen to it and we can't talk about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's the news.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: at least they're trying I know, I know obviously we don't take delight in any studio really closing so it's good to hear that they're still at it so best of luck to them with whatever direction they end up going in but yeah, the
[SPEAKER_07]: Those Microsoft closures really were a
[SPEAKER_07]: You now have the labeled and standardized accessibility tags available to you.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had talked about this before that Microsoft was going to be incorporating these into the Microsoft Store, but they are out now.
[SPEAKER_07]: The goal is to, quote, provide players with clear and consistent information about the accessibility features in video games.
[SPEAKER_07]: So for an example, let's take a game like South of Midnight, which is a relatively recent release.
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com
[SPEAKER_07]: Visual features feature color alternatives, camera comfort, large and clear subtitles, and then input features include adjustable input sensitivity and playable without button holds.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's all I can read in the little screenshot.
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, Luke,
[SPEAKER_07]: maybe on-demand tutorials, that more strikes me as like a Bobby Blackwolf mode type of thing in a game.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm not shading it whatsoever because I'm kind of thinking like, oh, I do like it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, have you ever, and I'm sure you've all done this, have you ever played a game for like five hours, then you got distracted by something else, and you went back to that first game and you're like, I don't remember what the buttons do in this game.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember how to play this game.
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess I'll have to start over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...
[SPEAKER_07]: I do that all of the time all of the time ask me why I've played Pokemon Sword and Shield like seven times at this point and haven't beaten it yet or not Sword and Shield sorry um Scarlet and Violet like seven times at this point and still haven't beaten it so on demand when I've like forgot like not how to play it but just like I barely started this game I'm just gonna start it over again yeah
[SPEAKER_07]: So, well, I see a few people in chat, Fifth Dream and Bobby Blackwolf, ironically, are both with me saying all the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it does happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: It does happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: The standardized tags, this is being managed by the Entertainment Software Association.
[SPEAKER_07]: So file this under good things that the ESA have done.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a very small file, but this is important to put in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Input from companies included Nintendo, EA, Ubisoft, Sony, Microsoft, Amazon Games, Riot Games, Square Enix, and Warner Brothers Game have all signed on to the project.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are 24 accessibility tags.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo and Sony have not yet updated their stores with these tags.
[SPEAKER_07]: Microsoft is the first of the big three to do so.
[SPEAKER_07]: So very interesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I would imagine the other stores will follow soon.
[SPEAKER_07]: So very cool feature for people that are looking for...
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, specific accessibility needs in certain games.
[SPEAKER_07]: So curious to see how this develops and really translates to, you know, allowing more people to play a game they may not otherwise have.
[SPEAKER_07]: So.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: S2100 Matt says, every once in a while, the ESA gets one clap.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: A broken clock is still right twice a day.
[SPEAKER_07]: We all know that old adage, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So, but I would say, I feel like the ESA...
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like they've had more wins lately.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I feel like the last year especially, I've been like, okay, this isn't the end of the... This isn't alright to do, but maybe it was all stories related to this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't doubt that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe something lit the fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's always a possibility.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_07]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of people who should have a fire lit... We still have the industry doing a lot of crappy things though, right, Jamie?
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be soft.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Ubisoft, even though they just got the $1.25 billion Tencent investment, they've laid off 19 workers at Star Trek Bridge Crew and a Tom Clancy game, Red Storm, for Ubisoft Red Storm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they are like...
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, yeah, it's part of our restructuring program.
[SPEAKER_03]: We made the decision to eliminate 19 roles at Red Storm Entertainment.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the quote.
[SPEAKER_03]: At least that's how I understood it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's just summarized for context.
[SPEAKER_03]: They say, this is not an easy decision.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a necessary one given our operational priorities.
[SPEAKER_03]: Blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_03]: um severance packages blowing you know smoke up their ass that kind of thing um they said that no other locations were impacted by the layoffs but they didn't comment when asked for more information about the head count um for uh for Red Storm and their projects so um yeah um
[SPEAKER_03]: But they got all this money from Tencent, so... I mean, I understand it being an ongoing restructuring, but even so, when they have an influx of money, then should they not reevaluate that plan?
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless this influx of money was a calculated part of that plan, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: But... I'm just like...
[SPEAKER_07]: You do wish some of these companies would see that they could do a morally nice thing, correct thing I would even argue, by, you know, let's say you have these 19 people on Star Trek Bridge Crew, which I understand that game's been out a little while now.
[SPEAKER_07]: VR gaming hasn't exactly launched into the stratosphere.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, you know, it's kind of there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Although, you know, Beat Saber's still doing its thing, because I saw some of that during Summer Games Done Quick, too, and that was fun to watch.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say, they stopped their support for that game, but I know it.
[SPEAKER_07]: On PlayStation, but that's because it's a meta thing now, so Facebook wants it all to itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other stuff, you know, I mean, this was a studio in North Carolina, but we're also dealing with a lot of video game related research losing their funding.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of schools losing their funding for their programs because of the turd in chief.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_03]: and you know library services losing their funding which also we're doing some cataloging of games so it's it's really not a good time
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, just to quickly finish my thought too on what I wish Ubisoft would have done, if you know you're going to lay off these 19 people on this one game, why can't you invest just a little bit into the learning or the development of these folks to be able to put them on another project, to be able to assign them to another, you know, it's not like Ubisoft doesn't have tons of other projects out there that could use a little help in moving along.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just, it's just, it's unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_03]: What?
[SPEAKER_07]: What?
[SPEAKER_03]: What?
[SPEAKER_07]: What?
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at who's in charge.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say in charge of what, but it doesn't matter either way you slice it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, but it's just... Yeah, and I'm sure the investors are happy because at the end of the day, it's more money in their pocket.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just...
[SPEAKER_07]: When in the fuck are billionaires going to start to feel the heat for once?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I would like to know.
[SPEAKER_06]: We start eating them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yummy, yummy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe when people walk in higher force and with torches.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just, it's a crazy world we live in.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's talk about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stupid world we live in is what it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a crazy, stupid world.
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, let's talk about deals going, you know, deals for the rest of us going away.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you know, Nintendo used to have this thing, this voucher program where you'd pay $100 and it'd allow you to get two Nintendo games.
[SPEAKER_06]: Saving you a little bit of money because, you know, the games were like $60 or, you know, in some cases now $70.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, that was a savings of potentially $40 if you played your cards right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...
[SPEAKER_06]: So Nintendo, you know, I guess thinking that somehow devaluing their $80 games, says, uh-uh-uh, we're gonna kill this, and it's going away January 2026.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's my question with all that, because this part would make a little more sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you able to use those Nintendo vouchers on Switch 2 games?
[SPEAKER_07]: or are you using Nintendo vouchers on Switch 1 games and you are still going to have to pay the upgrade fee?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because remember, Metroid Prime 4 and Pokemon ZA Legends, blah, blah, blah, are original Switch games, technically.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would never want to play Pokemon Legends ZA on an original Switch.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: The original cries enough.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't imagine what a shitshow Z to A is going to be.
[SPEAKER_07]: But on the Switch 2, I'm sure it'll be great.
[SPEAKER_07]: But...
[SPEAKER_07]: if these vouchers only work on the original Nintendo Switch then I could see that maybe Nintendo is sunsetting them simply because there are not going to be as many original Switch first party titles coming like we know Tomodachi Life but that's probably the end of it
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, right now it's basically talking about with the Switch vouchers.
[SPEAKER_06]: It says, what are Nintendo Switch vouchers?
[SPEAKER_06]: Blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It says that they, you know, obviously they purchased in sets of two and cannot be redeemed for Nintendo Switch 2 games.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yes, you do have a point.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you should be aware if you use this to get Metroid Prime 4 and
[SPEAKER_07]: Pokemon Legends CA you're going to have to buy the upgrades so you're going to have to math this out and see if this still saves you money because the question would be are they $20 upgrades or are they $10 upgrades because if they're $10 upgrades you would probably save money if they're $20 upgrades you might not
[SPEAKER_06]: It says they said spending $120 on vouchers and upgrades instead of the $140 is what they would normally be.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm guessing the upgrades are $10 then?
[SPEAKER_07]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just couldn't remember how much they were for the Zeldas.
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought there were $20 for the Zelda games.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't keep track of it anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because the system is too complicated.
[SPEAKER_06]: So...
[SPEAKER_06]: That sucks, but I don't know if they're going to come out with anything similar to that for Switch 2.
[SPEAKER_07]: DEF says $10 for Switch 2 upgrades.
[SPEAKER_07]: So then it would still save you money because you would buy the vouchers.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just like you said, it's $120 for the voucher way and $140 if you don't do the voucher way.
[SPEAKER_07]: for Prime and Pokemon ZA.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I have to think about if I might want to do this, actually, because my coworkers were kind enough to gift me $100 in Nintendo credit.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just kind of assumed I was going to get Donkey Kong Bananas with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But now I'm like, ooh, maybe I want to get the vouchers so that I can get Prime 4
[SPEAKER_07]: and that because essentially my coworkers graciously already bought me that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So really, I'd only be paying the 20 bucks to upgrade them.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess and those are games I know I'm going to play the heck out of.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the question is, am I going to be suckered into an impulse buy with Donkey Kong?
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's be real with ourselves.
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_07]: I probably will.
[SPEAKER_07]: I probably I still want to get Bravely Default 2 or Bravely Default for Switch 2, which I still haven't purchased.
[SPEAKER_07]: So because I'm forcing myself to beat some games I already own first, like Fantasy Life.
[SPEAKER_07]: So.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: S2100 Matt says, Rob has nice coworkers.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I do.
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually thought that was really cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and we try, we kind of tried to do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: We know people's interests, like, you know, so we'll try to get a gift card.
[SPEAKER_07]: If we know their interest, if we don't, then there's always like, you know, an Amazon card or a, you know, coffee, something.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, they knew that I was a gamer, probably because my boss has listened to this show before.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, if you're out there listening.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that, Jamie?
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, hi, Rob's boss.
[SPEAKER_07]: Give them a raise.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, the thing that I like is that work – and this was true about one of my older jobs too that I had.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm very fortunate because this show has been on so damn long.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've had multiple jobs during the course of being on this show.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the thing that's in common with my current employer as well as an employer I've had in the past is that my boss would recognize that the skills that I use to put on this –
[SPEAKER_07]: could be things that lend themselves in the workplace, such as we might be looking at trying to do a podcast at work.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe Rob is somebody that knows a little something about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or at my old job, it was Rob uses all those tech things.
[SPEAKER_07]: We should get him into e-learning development.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's how I got my foot in the door when it came to e-learning development.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's...
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I'm very happy when an employer can sort of recognize those sort of strengths.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I have also been fortunate and privileged enough to work at places that I do feel like do the morally correct thing we were talking about earlier and make those types of investment in their workforces to make stronger employees, which unfortunately in the video game industry... That's why I like where I work.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: It leads to happy employees.
[SPEAKER_07]: But unfortunately with so many companies in the video game industry, not all, it wouldn't be fair to say all, but so many companies in the video game industry is not the case.
[SPEAKER_07]: People are just expendable and it's just, it's very unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people enjoy money more than other people.
[SPEAKER_07]: S2100 Matt says, treating employees well, crazy talk, Rob.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: But to put things in perspective, I worked at that former company for 14 years until the writing was on the wall that our jobs were going to be sent to another country.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I left.
[SPEAKER_07]: And my current employer, I'll stay at until I'm 65 if they'll have me, quite honestly.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't plan to leave.
[SPEAKER_07]: So...
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm planning on staying where I am I'll tell you what, me talking about how I like to make spreadsheets to track my progress in some of the games I play actually did get me an assignment so I was very happy I'm doing that with Pokemon Go and Shinies You should see my Dead by Daylight tracking list
[SPEAKER_07]: The funniest fucking thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I finally caved and bought an office subscription because I wanted PowerPoint for the thing we did at Southern Fried Gaming Expo.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, and the reality is because I use PowerPoint so fucking much in my day job, I was like, I can't do this open office stuff anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't do the Apple thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't use enough, Jamie.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't use it enough.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I was like, I need to be able to do this fast.
[SPEAKER_07]: So in times when you need the- Why don't you just get something-
[SPEAKER_03]: Go with what you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: With what?
[SPEAKER_03]: OpenOffice or LibreOffice work exactly the same as PowerPoint.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they do not.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, they don't.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just said why.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the muscle memory that I have with PowerPoint doesn't work with OpenOffice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I can tell you, I do this show role in OpenOffice, whatever their version of Excel is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Numbers?
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what they call it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever the OpenOffice is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Numbers is Apple.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sheets.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sheets.
[SPEAKER_07]: Holy sheets.
[SPEAKER_07]: I do the show but then like honestly, but now I did a Pokemon Go.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have my shiny.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm making a spreadsheet for all of my shinies so I can show what I'm willing to trade at a moment's notice in Excel because I just, again, when you spend so much time in Excel at your day job, I swear to God I can do it two times faster, three times faster in that than trying to use another program.
[SPEAKER_07]: So,
[SPEAKER_07]: I do much better presentations though with numbers and and keynote but which which is also am embedded in both of those with the projects I'm on I'm not saying I'm loyal to Excel because I love Microsoft I'm loyal to Excel because that's what my company chose to use during the day so that's what I know so it's that that's what it is yeah yeah if you want to use if you want to use the you know the boring
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: S the show and Hunter Matt says, Shane taught you well.
[SPEAKER_07]: This had nothing to do with Shane, actually.
[SPEAKER_07]: I even texted him saying, you'd be proud of me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm making a spreadsheet for Pokemon.
[SPEAKER_07]: Def said, you made a spreadsheet for shinies.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're deep and shiny hunting it seems now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it's for Pokemon Go.
[SPEAKER_07]: And because it's all in the office thing, I can send people a OneDrive link when we turn lucky friends and I can say like, here's my shiny list.
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's in green, I have three or more and I'm willing to trade.
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's yellow, I have two or more and I might be willing to trade for something that I'm missing type of thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I have my whole little system.
[SPEAKER_07]: So now when I go lucky friends and people are like, what do you have?
[SPEAKER_07]: I can send a list and be like, here, this is what I have.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what I don't have.
[SPEAKER_07]: Done.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a detailed spreadsheet outlining everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'm a gamer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people's eyes close over and they're like, what in the corporate America is this?
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, where the hell were we?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, we're going to get to this story about Nintendo.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this isn't cute, and this plays into something we were talking about at the beginning of the show.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this has to do with a Nintendo Switch 2 user who is claiming to be banned from their Switch 2 for a fault that they're saying is not their own.
[SPEAKER_07]: so here's the thing it is an owner that posted on reddit and usually you would take these reddit stories and go does that make it true but thinking through this is where you have to bring in the wheel of plausibility thinking of everything this guy this this individual i should say this guy this individual is talking about it certainly adds up it adds up with everything we know about nintendo system and the way things work and it's worth talking about so here it is
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, they downloaded patches for Switch game cards, Switch 1 cards, that they bought off a Facebook marketplace.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there's your first mistake.
[SPEAKER_07]: Never buy anything off Facebook marketplace.
[SPEAKER_07]: That place is a shithole.
[SPEAKER_07]: But...
[SPEAKER_07]: I know people have used it successfully.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure chat is correcting me as I'm speaking.
[SPEAKER_06]: I purchased a DDR machine off of Facebook Marketplace.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what a cesspool it can be there too.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to be very, very careful.
[SPEAKER_07]: Buyer or seller.
[SPEAKER_03]: One key word, Facebook.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is a key part of the problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, Craigslist felt safer.
[SPEAKER_07]: But here we are in this day and age where a lot of people are using Facebook Marketplace.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it actually, at the end of the day, it doesn't matter where he bought it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the user on Reddit said they put the game into their Switch 2 to patch, but found out their online services were restricted the day after.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Switch 2 user then called Nintendo, where they discovered they were banned.
[SPEAKER_07]: Banned.
[SPEAKER_07]: and DarkSakura.com.
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
[SPEAKER_07]: and then resell that physical game card so that's where you have to get a little distrusting of places like Facebook Marketplace you don't know if the card you're buying is even legit in the first place
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, once Nintendo detects two instances of the unique code being online at the same time, it's going to ban any account that's using it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, you know, if you are pirating Nintendo software, you know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you're buying things secondhand, especially in a place full of casual buyers like Facebook, you may not know that this cartridge is actually a burned, essentially, image from online, and it may get your Switch 2 bricked.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, after proving that they bought the Switch games, the Redditors said they were told the cartridges are fine and able to be resold.
[SPEAKER_07]: But this is still a very kind of interesting tale that's probably going to give people reservation about buying games secondhand.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Dr. Zia said, I've heard about folks being banned for using that device you were referring to.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mish in chat says, I feel like at this point they're putting too many restrictions on the Switch 2 now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mind you, I don't condone pirating.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly, and there's the rub.
[SPEAKER_07]: I may not support pirating, but somebody may be able to make a really convincing fake.
[SPEAKER_07]: If they have the right color cartridge and a good enough printer to make a little sticker, what am I going to do?
[SPEAKER_07]: Lick that cartridge to tell if it's authentic or not?
[SPEAKER_03]: Were you just reading my mind?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I was saying you could lick it.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, literally, if I were ever to be at a point in my life where I'm buying Switch games off Facebook Marketplace, I would insist on doing the lick test.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, but I'm going to need to lick this game.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but they could probably put that stuff on there.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just...
[SPEAKER_06]: You can get that stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: But would they think to?
[SPEAKER_07]: Would they think that the casual people would do it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't put anything that you get from Facebook Marketplace in your mouth.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_07]: I might end up with more than a Switch game.
[SPEAKER_07]: I might end up with more than a Switch game.
[SPEAKER_07]: I might end up with a staff infection.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would not trust that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, maybe silverware.
[SPEAKER_06]: We run that through the dishwasher.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, I'm not like...
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_07]: Free antibiotics.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have malaria.
[SPEAKER_07]: How else am I supposed to know if the game is legit or not without trying to eat it?
[SPEAKER_06]: And let's just put it this way.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like those old cartoons of Porky Pig or Bugs Bunny or whoever biting down on the nickel to see if it's real.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's not even Facebook Marketplace though, because the same thing could happen anywhere you buy used games with the Switch.
[SPEAKER_06]: Granted, you know, like say if I purchase it from GameStop or something like that, there's a little bit of recourse because they can go back and see, oh, this person traded it in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Although technically it's not stolen, so they can't really...
[SPEAKER_06]: It wouldn't be a matter for the police.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that they keep the information about the person that trades stuff in because of different laws regarding stolen goods.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in this case, if it's just that you traded in something that was banned, I don't know what they could really do there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean...
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know I don't know if they'd pursue it it's that whole thing so GameStop from what I understand will not take a game that is sealed they will not buy back a game that is sealed um because the chance is too high that it was stolen off a shelf but what ends up happening is that some people find it under the Christmas tree or whatever and they try to sell it back and because they're like I already have this game or whatever and then GameStop won't take it because
[SPEAKER_06]: It's stupid anyways.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the whole problem was created by Nintendo in the first place to try to combat piracy, but really you're doing more harm to the consumer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Once again, going back to the whole adage with DRM anyways, a lot of the times it's a legitimate consumer that gets punished more over this DRM than the actual people pirating those games.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the people pirating those games...
[SPEAKER_06]: they're playing it on a modded Switch that's probably not connected to the internet so for them, they're not really going to run into any problems but the consumer that is using that card yeah, they will run into problems, which sucks it to me communicates that Nintendo is not doing this right but yeah
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very interesting comments in chat.
[SPEAKER_07]: S2100Matt says, I knew someone who bought a hearing aid off of a dead person.
[SPEAKER_07]: The family sold it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's actually not that uncommon, though, because that's just medical equipment.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when grandma or grandpa passes away, quite oftentimes there's an estate sale and wheelchair, hospital bed, all of that ends up being up for grabs and people need that stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a weird-ass fucking reflection of the society we live in.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yes, the hearing aid doesn't surprise me, honestly.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a charity group in Alabama.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's how my mom got oxygen tanks and a walker when she had gotten out of the hospital that will take in donated, you know, whether they're from the deceased or old surplus or what have you, and then loan them out for free to people who need them indefinitely.
[SPEAKER_07]: um interesting Ranmari says maybe they don't want the game because some cruel motherfucker gifted them a crazy bullet hell game well that's absurd bullet hell games are fun they're frustrating but you should at least try them anyway uh that's when you that's when you create the service we'll adopt your unloved bullet hell games for free you're just giving Ranmari Idea a sign for their next convention to walk around holding um
[SPEAKER_07]: TheGorilla72 says, so why does GameStop sell me new games that are open then?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that still a thing that GameStop does?
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought they were told to knock that off.
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, y'all, I have not bought a game in GameStop in so long.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't tell you the last time I bought a game there.
[SPEAKER_06]: They use it for displays.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, Gorilla says they sure do.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a display copy because manufacturers are being cheap.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't send display copies for these stores.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they have one that's out there and then they keep everything behind the counter because they don't want live product out on the floor for a lot of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: They should get the person that draws all the fake box art at GameStop to... Just don't buy games from GameStop.
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: That just saves yourself.
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, it really doesn't make sense to do it anymore unless it's ultra convenient for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just go purchase it from anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_06]: Purchase it off Amazon, purchase it from wherever.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just GameStop...
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, even when you go in looking for things, it's just very not what it used to be, obviously.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't give them money.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is weird to me, though, if that's the reason.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because TigerClaw says, why not print the box art?
[SPEAKER_07]: And I do have to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Copyright.
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually is a legal thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: But wouldn't the publisher send a PDF?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, they are trying to sell that publisher's game.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura,
[SPEAKER_06]: dating everybody here so it's kind of like the blockbuster model where you have you know your thing on the shelf with the game and you go up to me like I would like this game and they have all the games behind the counter but there's one copy that they use to make that display copy that then doesn't have the card in it well right no no that's I don't think that that's
[SPEAKER_03]: is that what they were talking about?
[SPEAKER_03]: just having the one up there?
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought they were talking about putting the copies out on the shelves the used ones we're crossing our wires we're talking about both at the same time this is basically where they're taking a new copy
[SPEAKER_06]: Opening it up, taking the game out, putting it behind the counter, and then someone wants to go purchase whatever game it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like, oh, it's the last copy.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's open.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to put the game back in there, and here you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the same price as new.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, well, hold on.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you opened that, though.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but it's new.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's never played, but it's new.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but it's not sealed.
[SPEAKER_06]: but you're trying to charge me the same price.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but it's new.
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, they should just take the hit for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, because they're not selling used copies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly, because, I mean, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not my problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: But they don't, and a lot of people just take it.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like, whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tiger Claw.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, like, SSG100 Matt says it's like selling the 4 model.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_07]: TigerClaw in chat says, I remember way back in the days at Toys R Us, they had something that looked like the box art and what was on the back of it so you can see what the game looks like.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you know in Japan they still use the slips?
[SPEAKER_07]: Shane just told me that.
[SPEAKER_07]: They still use the slips at Toys R Us in Japan.
[SPEAKER_07]: What a time to be alive.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's plenty of other places that do that too.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Japan, that is.
[SPEAKER_07]: TheGorilla72 says, I'm so old, I've been shopping at GameStop since they were Funkoland.
[SPEAKER_07]: My friend, I remember when Funkoland only advertised in magazines.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember when you had to get the piece of paper to find out what the price of the game was.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's GameStop.
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, you know that Dan managed GameStops for a long time, but he started with Funkoland.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, they're fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like, I don't know, like, I find myself wanting to go into them less and less.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, every time I go in there to look at stuff, it's just like, eh.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, there's no selection of anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just garbage I don't want.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's no deals.
[SPEAKER_07]: What was that Garfield shirt I saw the last time I was in a game shop?
[SPEAKER_07]: A game shop?
[SPEAKER_07]: A game stop.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was cracking up so fucking bad.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...
[SPEAKER_07]: God, now I gotta find it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was so bored, I went to GameStop.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll find it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do like to look- I actually got my Kirby coin purse there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, because they sell a lot of, like, crap now, but, you know, sometimes it's interesting crap.
[SPEAKER_03]: They actually have, like, really good official merch, and they'll have them marked down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'm trying to see if I can find-
[SPEAKER_03]: But when I lived in Alabama, we had EB and we had Babbage's.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I found it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I found it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a shirt with Garfield on it that said, Stay Chill, where Garfield's licking an ice cream cone.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, that's gamer merch?
[SPEAKER_07]: This looks like what mom wears the oversized shirt to stay home with.
[SPEAKER_07]: and sit on the couch all day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they sell pop culture stuff now, and so there's a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, seriously, because I got, I think, an Office shirt for my wife from there.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have lots of just... It's basically a Hot Topic merch now that they have in there because... I mean, to be honest, they're making...
[SPEAKER_06]: No Margin on the games, and they have to make profit with higher margin stuff, like those Funko Pops and everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: That said, though... Did somebody say Funko Pops at a GameStop?
[SPEAKER_03]: I got pictures of those too I just don't I'll do a deal on them if you like buy like they'll let you do the buy one get one thing if it's like you know because they do that for the sale ones if you're buying a new one and you want to pick up a sale one at the free or half price they'll do that sometimes I will say though they did have a nice Sprigatito purse they had a nice Sprigatito purse I would have maybe bought that
[SPEAKER_03]: Literally the last thing I bought at a GameStop was my little fuzzy Kirby coin purse and a squishy flying Kirby.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll put it on our Discord.
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, enough GameStop talk.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's move on to our next story.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I like squishy Kirbys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Me too, but... Alright, well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know people who are into scary-ass freaky game subnautica.
[SPEAKER_03]: and on July 2nd, Krafton had said they removed members of the Subnautica 2 leadership team after I think that there was a leak.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they did confirm that there was a leak and the game is kind of in a little bit of trouble.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's just a lot of drama around it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they got rid of the game director, Charlie Cleveland, the co-founder of Unknown Worlds, Max McGuire, and the studio CEO, Ted Gill And then they have since filed a lawsuit against the developer in South Korea for wrongful dismissal But they were canned because there was considered a lack of progress on the game and inadequate content
[SPEAKER_03]: and that they were not fulfilling their leadership duties and so the game is behind the schedule because of it but I don't know but the leak on here it's like a state of development where the development progress was and them disagreeing on the release schedules it's some pretty interesting stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: and while I don't, you know this is actually posted on Reddit and I mean, I'll tell you what, I'll repost it in our chat right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's always lovely to have your corporate drama playing out on Reddit.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a lovely thing for these companies to have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but at the same time, I mean, it is an interesting look behind the curtain especially because I think that
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
[SPEAKER_03]: they're even talking about like all of the list of changes from the launch specifications from 2023 to 2025 they're saying that there's a quote exactly on here it says the game's content volume has been scaled down compared to the initial EA spec target making it necessary to release the feasibility of the planned launch reassess sorry the feasibility of the planned launch but very
[SPEAKER_03]: Very curious.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it even talks about parts of what happens in the game.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me go ahead and spoil the plot.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so annoyed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, what do you got for us?
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Destiny 2 apparently is getting some blowback from their upcoming The Edge of Fate expansion.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were giving free loot for players, and apparently every day you can log in and get loot and all that stuff from...
[SPEAKER_06]: The Emissary Vendor, and eventually claim an infinite nonary engram.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, none of this makes any sense to me because I don't play any Destiny whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_07]: I played it a few times and I sort of remember that stuff, but I... Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: But basically... Rare digital shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: so apparently players had discovered a trick for farming them in mass and uh so because those nonary engrams or whatever drop cosmetics uh and Bungie basically said stop doing that uh so there's ways to essentially game the system to get all these unlimited cosmetics and you know
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't want that because that cuts into their bread and butter of monetization of their free-to-play games.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then also, because they did that, they shut down the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is due to an issue.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have disabled the daily bonus of Nonary Engram available at the Emissary.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are investigating a fix for the players.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then because of that, people are now mass-deleting characters.
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically saying that we are...
[SPEAKER_06]: We are tired of this nonsense.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not gonna take it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we're not gonna take it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, they said basically kill my drive for Luta Palooza.
[SPEAKER_06]: Looks like tonight I finally check out that Mecha Break game.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't give them any more attention.
[SPEAKER_06]: We already saw enough trailers for that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sheld Need for Speed
[SPEAKER_07]: and is quietly parking, is that a pun, the series.
[SPEAKER_07]: Speed Hunters was a site, by the way, that was partially funded by EA, or I think maybe it was funded in full by EA, and last had an update in April and is apparently ceasing operations.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_07]: No official statement yet from EA on the Need for Speed franchise, but...
[SPEAKER_07]: The publisher did shut down online servers for Need for Speed Rivals on October 7th.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or it will be shutting it down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Criterion Games moved most of the employees to focus on the Battlefield franchise.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Battlefield head Vince Zampella told Eurogamer that the Need for Speed team would be, quote, "...joining their colleagues working on Battlefield."
[SPEAKER_07]: So if there is a need for speed going, we don't know who's working on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So signs are pointing to the fact that this franchise may be donezo, which is kind of sad.
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it really still had its fans.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I know Forza Horizon is a thing that a lot of people are playing, but that doesn't mean it can't exist at the same time with Need for Speed and some of the other big racing franchises out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of sad.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sj100Matt says, listen, I'm a petty bitch when it comes to Need for Speed.
[SPEAKER_07]: I always disliked the EA made Criterion Games work on the franchise rather than Burnout.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Burnout franchise died for Need for Speed to live and I'm bitter about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, valid.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really like Burnout too.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I understand that frustration to be quite honest.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, with all of these dying games, sometimes we need to go back and recognize a classic, something we want to go back and play.
[SPEAKER_07]: Although, I don't know, it might be difficult to check out this one, but we'll see.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's roll the Classic Game of the Week bump and let Jamie do her thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for the classic game of the week.
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, DarkSakura, what did you pick for us this week?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell or Jigoku
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to reach Buddha to have your fate decided.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tarosuke has key bullets that he can fire at enemies and charge to increase his power.
[SPEAKER_03]: Enemies can drop money and you can buy weapons and other stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are two versions.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is actually of the arcade release.
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a Japanese version and an English version but that English version was only released in other Asian countries outside of Japan the arcade archives by the way have both versions of the game so Tarosuke was banished to Jigoku for causing mischief in the world of the living and so he has to go fight
[SPEAKER_03]: the monsters in hell to reach Iyama who is the Buddhist deity that judges the dead to determine his fate and you have five different levels each taking place in different parts of Jigoku so there is Jigoku Iriguchi which is the gate to hell, Yukai the ghost sea, other levels like that and so the first four stages have a boss fight with an Oni
[SPEAKER_03]: and then at the beginning of these Tarosuke has to kneel in a shrine and summon a spirit named Monmotaro to defeat the oni and you play as Monmotaro not Momotaro but Monmotaro and you can fly around and shoot pellets kind of you know
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it gets harder as you go along and you have to find different secret items to unlock the way out.
[SPEAKER_03]: All kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And on top of that, the Famicom version has a pious meter that's filled when Tarosuke does good deeds, such as completing his objectives in the levels.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the pious meter also determines which of the endings that you get.
[SPEAKER_03]: So given that I did speak about a Famicom version, there are other releases.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was ported to the PC Engine and Famicom with some changes, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: The PC Engine version and the arcade version were both re-released for the Japanese Virtual Console.
[SPEAKER_03]: and a Japan-only spin-off called Kyukai Dolchiki, which is a baseball version of the game.
[SPEAKER_03]: A yakyu, as it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's very similar to Namco's World Stadium series.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tarosuke also appeared in Namco X Capcom on PS2 and he teamed up with Taira no Kagekiyo from Genpei Tomaden and he also has a cameo appearance in Project X Zone 2 for the 3DS.
[SPEAKER_03]: At any rate, Game Machine publication said that Yokai Dolchiki was the most popular arcade game in the month of April 1987 and went on to be
[SPEAKER_03]: The fifth highest grossing table arcade game in 1987 in Japan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, Gamest gave it some awards.
[SPEAKER_03]: It won the 8th Grand Prize and 4th Best Ending Award and 8th Best Graphics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Famitsu gave it the Silver Hall of Fame.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's for the Famicom version.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a neat, fun little game.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know not a lot of people have heard of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's worth checking out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, this I, you know, again, I'm sorry, the podcast listeners can't see the visuals here.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, this is, this is a pretty neat looking game for the era, especially kind of the aesthetic with the gigantic mini map in the corner.
[SPEAKER_07]: And just like one small, like, really, it's just like the bottom half of the screen is the actual game.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know why it gives me kind of Rygar vibes with the setup like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because like Rygar, Rygar...
[SPEAKER_07]: The game kind of takes place in a strip through the middle and the rest is all like UI.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I did not know much about this game, but I'm kind of intrigued, I got to admit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also that era of Namco artwork that I think led to the Cosmo Gang style is what I like to call it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the Cosmo Gang and the Point Blank style is that same art style.
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, we did get, you know, Makaimura and
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, now that guy's praying in front of a statue and was breathing fire.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is where you have Mon Motaro to play for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is really cool, though.
[SPEAKER_07]: As far as a piece of gaming's history, I bet not a lot of people heard of this.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you said this is on a PS2 anthology.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it on any of the NAMCO discs from back in the day?
[SPEAKER_03]: The PS2 is that Tarosuke has an appearance
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, oh, my bad, my bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a character in Namco X Capcom and he's in Cameo and Project X Zone 2.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, okay, that's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was in the Arcade Archives and Virtual Console.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Arcade Archives, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, which of course is available for PS4 and up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah, no, Arcade Archives is great.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, okay, that's a way you could play this then.
[SPEAKER_07]: I might have to check that out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it's...
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a fun little one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've played a little bit of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just one of those games that I pick up and play for a little bit, and then I'm like, okay, I played it, and I don't think about it for another year.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, cool pick, though.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I might actually check that out on Arcade Archives.
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, at this point, though, I must apologize.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to bid everybody adieu because my migraine is now at that point.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry to hear that, but I do hope you feel better.
[SPEAKER_07]: And do you have any parting words or final thoughts for our listeners tonight before we let you go?
[SPEAKER_03]: Killers be stinky in DVD, and I'm a stinky killer.
[SPEAKER_07]: I still have not played this anniversary event I haven't I don't even think the game's installed oh no I lost access to it on PS5 I still have the Steam version though but yeah well then Rob play with me on Tuesday um maybe I gotta see what my schedule is this week but maybe I got a lot of stuff going on in my day job this week but maybe late at night
[SPEAKER_03]: One last little thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did Swan Lake yesterday, and I felt like I was a den mother hanging out backstage because I was only in two minutes of the dance because I had been injured when we started rehearsals.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for every dancer out there, for everyone who does any kind of sport, make sure there is somebody with an equipped first aid kit and bring scissors.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We try to have that when performing the Rocky Horror Picture Show.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good idea for any situation with a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a first aid kit.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everyone owes it to themselves to at least be first aid certified at one point in their life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you never know when that's going to save somebody's life or prevent a worse injury.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what I have to leave everyone with.
[SPEAKER_07]: The beat to CPR is staying alive.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do do do do do do do do do do do.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of other songs, but Stayin' Alive is the one that I remember because literally that's what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what you're doing with CPR, so it's easier to remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Feel better, DarkSakura.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a good night.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, I knew other people would start saying other games and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's go over to Loki.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a question in chat, actually.
[SPEAKER_07]: Chat wants to know, what is the game that is playing behind you tonight on stream?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because usually, as we're taping live at VOG Network, you have a game that plays behind you, which this looks like some type of Zelda clone.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that that Dungeon Maker game?
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't...
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't think it was Legally distinct, excuse me, legally distinct Sure
[SPEAKER_06]: hmm so yes it's just was this something they ran in the middle of the night at Summer Games Done Quick or something is that why it's in the bundle oh wow must have it must have been one of the games I haven't gotten a chance to check it out but yeah it certainly it looks like a link to the past for sure I didn't realize Humble Bundle was running a thing right now for Summer Games Done Quick um is it over at this point maybe no it's still going for another four days
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: I gotta try to find it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm actually looking at their site right now to try to see what this is all about because I feel like oh there it is I feel like you know Humble Bundle just kind of turned into any other store at some point but I guess we can point out here real quick let's see they have okay leave me alone I hate these pop-ups they have yeah Collateral Damage that's a fun game oh Roller Coaster there's that Lena's Inception that you're talking about okay so they have like nine indie games for that that's kind of cute
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because Lenda's Inception itself is $10, and the bundle is basically $10 or more, so it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's move on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get to some rapid-fire news and talk about some other things that are going on in the industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Loki, we'll go to you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess this is silly, but GameStop is auctioning off for charity the stapler that ruined Nintendo Switch 2s in Staten Island.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is so weird.
[SPEAKER_07]: How desperate are they for money?
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not even desperate for money.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's desperate for attention because they're doing it for charity.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's for charity?
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, then I'll let it go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's for the Children's Miracle Network Hospitals.
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, I mean...
[SPEAKER_06]: If you really want to poo poo on their goodwill, which I'm always willing to do, it's a tax write off for them as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you like to round up your purchase today to save sick kids?
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you like to round up your purchase today to feed hungry kids?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I would prefer billionaires feed them as opposed to you getting a tax write off.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so as much as I like the idea of them raising money for taxes, this is just a big ol' attention thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just... I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't... I'd be surprised if this company lasts till 2030, let's be honest.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_06]: What else do we have, Loki?
[SPEAKER_06]: We also have Cyberpunk 2077 headed to July's PlayStation Plus for PlayStation 5.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium.
[SPEAKER_06]: You get Cyberpunk 2077, Abiotic Factor, Banishers, Ghosts of New Eden, Bluey the video game, Planet Zoo, Risk of Rain 2, Tropico 6, and New World... I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a made-up name.
[SPEAKER_06]: ATRM?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: PlayStation Plus Premium is also getting some older games, Twisted Metal 3 and 4 as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool!
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let's talk about Summer Games Done Quick.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were mentioning it earlier in the show, but we wanted to share with you the official total that was raised, which is $2,436,614.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was all raised, of course, for Doctors Without Borders.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was pointed out that that was a little bit under what was raised in 2025.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was $2.5 million that was raised in 2025.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, there's a million factors that could go into that, and certainly raising $2.4-plus million for an awesome charity, I don't think there's any way you can frame that as a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there's just a lot of other things vying for attention now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Summer Games and Awesome Games Done Quick did their best years when everybody was stuck at home during COVID and couldn't go out and do other things.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would say probably things that impact the weather.
[SPEAKER_07]: If the weather is pretty nice out, people are probably going to be less inclined to stay at home and watch Games Done Quick.
[SPEAKER_07]: It just depends what else is going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's other competition in the charity space as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of people raising money for various charities.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I still think it's really rad that Games Done Quick, all of these years later, because it's been going on for a while, can still raise...
[SPEAKER_07]: Well over $2 million for the charity, which is great.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you know $50 million all time over that raised in the history of all the Games Done Quick marathon events?
[SPEAKER_07]: So pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Direct donations, but also partner donations, fan gammer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did I really just almost read fan gamer as fan gammer?
[SPEAKER_07]: Y'all, I'm getting old.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Yeti, fan gammer, where every gammer has a voice.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the Humble Bundle.
[SPEAKER_07]: were all part of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that also explains their tie-in there was that they were a partner with Summer Games Done Quick.
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, Summer Games Done Quick had runs like Super Mario Maker 2, Mario Kart World, Deltarune, some of the newer games that were included towards the end there.

[SPEAKER_07]: So Ranma's telling us in chat that the X or cross is silent in Hunter, and I'm bitching about it's never consistent, because you have a title like Namco Cross Capcom, or then you have one where it's like, or Final Fantasy X, or it's the X means, or Final Fantasy X-2 specifically, not X-2, or you have something where it's, I'm trying to think of one where you actually do say X, Mortal Kombat X, like it's never fucking consistent, the usage of the X. I'm just gonna emphasize it even harder now.
[SPEAKER_06]: is what I'm going to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Chunathem Crossverse.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Ranmari.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Donkey Kong Bonanza on Switch 2, Forgotten 23 on PC, Phantom Squad on PC.
[SPEAKER_06]: I read this completely wrong the first time.
[SPEAKER_06]: It said, who's at the door?
[SPEAKER_06]: I read that as who ate the door, which I was like, that's silly.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's on PC as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Shadow Labyrinth on PC, Xbox Series X,
[SPEAKER_06]: PlayStation 5, Switch, and Switch 2.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is it.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we're almost towards the part of the show where we'll take your calls over on our Discord server, but you should join our Discord server anyway.
[SPEAKER_07]: You all have lovely conversations throughout the week.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's over at vognetwork.com slash Discord, vognetwork.com slash Discord, and we will look to the green room to see if anybody wants to give us a chat later on.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we do have one more story for you here, a very topical story from Loki.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, and so, you know, Itch.io will do these different bundles for different charities and different things, usually stuff that's going on in the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, they did the bundle for racial justice, bundle for Ukraine, the California wildfires.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, now we have the No Ice in California Itch charity bundle.
[SPEAKER_06]: 500 games for a $10 donation.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is...
[SPEAKER_06]: basically going towards funding those, I guess, LA immigrants who are facing ICE invasions.
[SPEAKER_06]: Topical.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is Pixel Poops in it?
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you were in one of these.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was before in one of the other ones, but that's back when it cost something.
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember, as a reminder, it is free forever now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's right.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_07]: You made it free forever anyway.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, yeah, you could put it in the bundle, but...
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it doesn't matter because it's free anyway, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no, I think that's a great deal.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of it's tabletop games, though.
[SPEAKER_06]: They said 560 games that are in there, 427 of them are tabletop RPGs.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a lot of RPG.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there's a lot of tabletop players out there, too, that, you know, might enjoy a little bit of diversity in their Friday night game club or whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the games when they're talking about, like, which ones you should check out of the bundle.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of them is Wrap Your Boyfriend, a high school romance.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is exactly what you think it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well, definitely a worthy cause as far as I'm concerned.
[SPEAKER_07]: Clever boy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, hope you'll check that out over on itch.io.
[SPEAKER_07]: With that, we are towards the end of the show, but we want to open it up to any questions you might have for us in chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I forgot...
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie is not here to do the mailbag so I'm going to try to bring that up real quick.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the meantime, Loki, do you have any last minute stories for us tonight?
[SPEAKER_06]: I do not, actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, there's no last minute stories.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, I feel like we don't have anything to talk about.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I said at the top of the show, it wasn't exactly a busy, busy week, all things considered.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I do want to thank, so we didn't officially get like any emails to read tonight.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I do want to thank, we got an email from E3VL who actually sent a code for me for the Pokemon trading card game.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to be honest, I kind of fell off the wagon with that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'll still redeem the codes because you never know when I might get back on that wagon.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I do appreciate you sending that along.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I did kind of fall off the trading card game bandwagon at some point.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if I was just getting annoyed I kept getting so many repeats or what it was.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just found another game to...
[SPEAKER_07]: Break the cycle.
[SPEAKER_07]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_07]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_07]: So, well, if you want to send us an email for a future week, participate at orangelaundradio.com is the place to do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess otherwise, we'll wrap things up for tonight.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I want to thank you all, of course, for listening to Orange Lawns Radio.

[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got a lot.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it'll be good.
