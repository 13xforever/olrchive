[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

3
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:46,094
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

4
00:00:46,114 --> 00:00:48,438
[SPEAKER_07]: It is Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:48,478 --> 00:00:55,629
[SPEAKER_07]: We're live once again tonight, July the 13th of 2025, episode number 1054 of our show.

6
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:57,431
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Rob Roberts.

00:00:57,451 --> 00:01:07,787
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm here with you every week to talk about video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, gaming recipes, gaming movies, gaming gossip.

8
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:08,428
[SPEAKER_07]: What else?

9
00:01:08,448 --> 00:01:09,429
[SPEAKER_07]: What else, DarkSakura?

10
00:01:09,449 --> 00:01:10,912
[SPEAKER_07]: The one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

11
00:01:10,932 --> 00:01:11,813
[SPEAKER_07]: What else am I missing?

12
00:01:11,833 --> 00:01:18,122
[SPEAKER_07]: Gaming... Gaming... Ballet moves?

13
00:01:21,207 --> 00:01:21,447
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

14
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:23,971
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, DarkSakura, you have a hard Discord on mute.

15
00:01:24,191 --> 00:01:24,872
[SPEAKER_07]: I can see the icon.

16
00:01:26,574 --> 00:01:29,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sorry.

17
00:01:29,078 --> 00:01:29,459
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you're fine.

18
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:31,401
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, why isn't she helping me out?

19
00:01:31,642 --> 00:01:34,245
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say gaming games.

20
00:01:34,265 --> 00:01:35,327
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, gaming games, yes.

21
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:40,587
[SPEAKER_03]: and strategies and ballet games, which I think there's like three.

22
00:01:40,607 --> 00:01:41,047
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

23
00:01:41,207 --> 00:01:42,069
[SPEAKER_07]: Gaming strategies.

24
00:01:42,129 --> 00:01:42,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

25
00:01:42,629 --> 00:01:46,395
[SPEAKER_07]: My favorite band is a code in Akari Warriors, ABBA.

26
00:01:46,735 --> 00:01:49,239
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a code you can use in Akari Warriors.

27
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:50,341
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a gaming strategy for you.

28
00:01:50,361 --> 00:01:53,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Gaming pinball table sucks.

29
00:01:53,185 --> 00:01:53,886
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's right.

30
00:01:53,926 --> 00:01:57,291
[SPEAKER_07]: I heard the pinball table's not good, but they didn't have it at Southern Friday.

31
00:01:57,311 --> 00:01:58,633
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not that it's not good.

32
00:01:58,793 --> 00:02:00,235
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just it's not great.

33
00:02:00,451 --> 00:02:02,313
[SPEAKER_07]: They didn't... When I went to Southern Fry, they didn't have that.

34
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:04,155
[SPEAKER_07]: That was one pinball table I was hoping to see.

35
00:02:04,176 --> 00:02:05,577
[SPEAKER_07]: But they did have that Elton John table.

36
00:02:05,617 --> 00:02:06,078
[SPEAKER_07]: It was great.

37
00:02:06,198 --> 00:02:06,939
[SPEAKER_07]: I did like that one.

38
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:08,140
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I fucking love Elton John.

39
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:08,461
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

40
00:02:08,681 --> 00:02:10,904
[SPEAKER_03]: I like... I would love one of those.

41
00:02:10,984 --> 00:02:12,866
[SPEAKER_03]: It was so much fun when I could hear it.

42
00:02:12,886 --> 00:02:13,267
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

43
00:02:13,487 --> 00:02:13,747
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

44
00:02:13,847 --> 00:02:18,773
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it was... They had that thing on full blast at Southern Fry, and I enjoyed that table a lot.

45
00:02:18,793 --> 00:02:23,539
[SPEAKER_07]: I noticed that Jersey Jack tends to make these very, like, lights...

46
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:29,327
[SPEAKER_07]: Show, Fireworks, they do the light show type of pinball tables, and I'm all for it, quite frankly.

47
00:02:29,367 --> 00:02:31,070
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a couple of Jersey Jacks.

48
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:34,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we have Lord of the Rings.

49
00:02:34,435 --> 00:02:35,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Lord of the Rings was Jersey Jack, I think.

50
00:02:36,117 --> 00:02:36,698
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure it was.

51
00:02:37,579 --> 00:02:39,282
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have Pirates of the Caribbean.

52
00:02:40,504 --> 00:02:40,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

53
00:02:40,624 --> 00:02:42,206
[SPEAKER_03]: And a couple of the Jersey Jack ones.

54
00:02:42,647 --> 00:02:43,067
[SPEAKER_07]: Love that.

55
00:02:43,548 --> 00:02:45,050
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, and gaming pinball.

56
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:47,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Sadly, they have descended into madness.

57
00:02:48,936 --> 00:02:52,581
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's say hello as well to the one and only Techmaster Loki.

58
00:02:53,017 --> 00:02:53,297
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

59
00:02:53,498 --> 00:02:55,481
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, we don't talk to you about pinball a lot.

60
00:02:55,501 --> 00:02:56,182
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you like pinball?

61
00:02:57,484 --> 00:03:01,291
[SPEAKER_06]: I still have that pinball table that I'm building that I... That's right.

62
00:03:01,311 --> 00:03:02,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's been a year.

63
00:03:02,412 --> 00:03:05,097
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been a year since I got it.

64
00:03:05,117 --> 00:03:08,643
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's been like a very long time since I've worked on it.

65
00:03:08,723 --> 00:03:10,566
[SPEAKER_06]: Just because it's so big and messy.

66
00:03:10,766 --> 00:03:11,127
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

67
00:03:11,147 --> 00:03:14,452
[SPEAKER_06]: It's sitting on the DDR machine right now, the kit.

68
00:03:14,472 --> 00:03:19,260
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do need to go back to it, assuming that it's not all destroyed.

69
00:03:19,443 --> 00:03:21,166
[SPEAKER_07]: What was the last time you played that DDR machine?

70
00:03:21,186 --> 00:03:22,988
[SPEAKER_07]: I know not during this summer.

71
00:03:23,009 --> 00:03:23,389
[SPEAKER_06]: A long time.

72
00:03:24,331 --> 00:03:24,972
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been a while.

73
00:03:25,492 --> 00:03:27,716
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I played it, I think, last year.

74
00:03:28,437 --> 00:03:29,418
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't played it this year.

75
00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:33,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Certainly not any time now because it's incredibly hot in the garage.

76
00:03:34,046 --> 00:03:35,448
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's been a while.

77
00:03:35,468 --> 00:03:44,742
[SPEAKER_03]: A friend of ours on... Hey, I was going to say, talk to Dan because we put up a split in our garage and that thing stays Arctic and it wasn't that bad.

78
00:03:45,515 --> 00:03:56,590
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, if I do anything in the garage, I'd be building an office in there so I can do streaming without people coming into the kitchen and screaming and yelling and microwaves and air fryers.

79
00:03:57,832 --> 00:04:01,196
[SPEAKER_03]: Extra talk to Dan about that because we have a really, really good mini split.

80
00:04:02,418 --> 00:04:03,319
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

81
00:04:03,339 --> 00:04:05,422
[SPEAKER_07]: And gaming garage tips.

82
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,705
[SPEAKER_03]: And we insulated our garage to build our arcade.

83
00:04:08,606 --> 00:04:09,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Gaming central air.

84
00:04:12,025 --> 00:04:40,176
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, hello to those This is the BGHVAC channel For all of your video game HVAC needs We also do pipe cleans and duct cleans We love to talk about And we use that microscope thing that we set down the thing to see if you've got spiders We love to talk about sucking and blowing here on Orange Saunders Radio Of course we're talking about air Anyway Talk about the gaming industry She does

85
00:04:42,518 --> 00:04:44,520
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gone from suck to blow.

86
00:04:48,765 --> 00:04:57,596
[SPEAKER_07]: Commenting live on the show, of course, all of you in our chat room because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

87
00:04:57,616 --> 00:05:02,882
[SPEAKER_07]: That's Voice of Geeks Network, 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

88
00:05:03,222 --> 00:05:10,551
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby Blackwolf was back tonight after his little vacay last week because he was working hard up in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

89
00:05:10,531 --> 00:05:33,872
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

90
00:05:33,852 --> 00:05:37,317
[SPEAKER_07]: and actually no, but he takes his time for all those lovely people to donate.

91
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,038
[SPEAKER_03]: What about being a slow walker?

92
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,384
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, so congrats to Bobby and everybody at GameStone Quick.

93
00:05:42,424 --> 00:05:47,271
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we have a story later on it, but I think y'all know they raised like over 2 million bucks, which is great.

94
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:48,793
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll talk more about that later in the show.

95
00:05:48,853 --> 00:05:59,168
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, kudos to VOG Zone, Bobby Blackwolf, who was a part of all that that went down up last week in Minneapolis and online everywhere.

96
00:05:59,738 --> 00:06:00,099
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

97
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Big thanks to those of you that are live in our chat room.

98
00:06:04,024 --> 00:06:06,027
[SPEAKER_07]: S2100 Matt says he's a speed reader for sure.

99
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:13,798
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I did see that one donation that was posted to our Discord that I think was during a Super Metroid run where he did do speed reading.

100
00:06:14,178 --> 00:06:16,481
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess that comment can stand.

101
00:06:16,762 --> 00:06:18,925
[SPEAKER_07]: I will not be striking that comment from the record after all.

102
00:06:19,325 --> 00:06:20,447
[SPEAKER_07]: So there you go.

103
00:06:20,427 --> 00:06:40,782
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

104
00:06:40,762 --> 00:07:09,385
[SPEAKER_07]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

105
00:07:10,343 --> 00:07:17,890
[SPEAKER_06]: Another piracy website went down for the Nintendo Switch because, you know, they're always combating piracy.

106
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:30,461
[SPEAKER_06]: So NSW2U is one of the, I guess, I don't know, more popular ROM sites for the Switch.

107
00:07:31,121 --> 00:07:39,068
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, but apparently it has been captured by the FBI, according to the domain now known

108
00:07:39,706 --> 00:07:45,896
[SPEAKER_06]: Popping up a website has been seized page.

109
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:48,079
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, yeah, that's... That's it.

110
00:07:48,119 --> 00:07:49,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of makes sense.

111
00:07:49,321 --> 00:07:53,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop pirating your games because now the FBI is coming after you.

112
00:07:54,108 --> 00:08:00,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Do it less of a flashy way instead of having a big public website that everybody can see and expect it not to go down.

113
00:08:00,999 --> 00:08:03,503
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, it's... I mean, that's just...

114
00:08:04,529 --> 00:08:09,577
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever, but Yes, I'm sure that has ended piracy for good now, right?

115
00:08:10,358 --> 00:08:18,731
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure that taking down this one website in no way will ever cause the Switch piracy scene to come back.

116
00:08:18,871 --> 00:08:21,255
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been completely defeated at this point.

117
00:08:22,163 --> 00:08:28,899
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, yeah, I mean, obviously, I don't endorse piracy of new stuff and things that are on the market.

118
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:38,601
[SPEAKER_07]: I know there are people trying to sort of like defend what was going on as sort of like a, God, what's the defense they usually use about pirating the new games?

119
00:08:38,621 --> 00:08:40,425
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it game preservation?

120
00:08:40,405 --> 00:08:44,169
[SPEAKER_07]: But that doesn't make any sense if a lot of these games are still for sale.

121
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Corporate sabotage, I'm down for that.

122
00:08:46,512 --> 00:08:55,402
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I guess, but hearing about all the layoffs that happen in the industry, unfortunately the wrong people are never held accountable when games don't sell well.

123
00:08:55,422 --> 00:08:58,585
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm not a fan of piracy of current stuff.

124
00:08:58,605 --> 00:09:06,955
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, if we're talking about, if this were a news article about a Nintendo 64 ROM website got shut down, I'd be a little more like, what the hell?

125
00:09:07,035 --> 00:09:09,838
[SPEAKER_07]: Because these games are not actively making money and all that stuff.

126
00:09:09,818 --> 00:09:12,505
[SPEAKER_07]: but we know that does still happen.

127
00:09:12,906 --> 00:09:15,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo of course being one of the most litigious but you were going to say Loki?

128
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:26,038
[SPEAKER_06]: There was one recently it wasn't like it was an indie game essentially so what it was is it was a beat-em-up game that was being done I

129
00:09:26,018 --> 00:09:53,038
[SPEAKER_06]: I still can't play it without the chipsets.

130
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,323
[SPEAKER_06]: You can.

131
00:09:54,443 --> 00:09:59,225
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a special retroarch thing that they built.

132
00:09:59,245 --> 00:10:00,008
[SPEAKER_03]: They've emulated it?

133
00:10:00,342 --> 00:10:02,144
[SPEAKER_03]: they finally have emulated it?

134
00:10:02,164 --> 00:10:17,101
[SPEAKER_06]: they did and I mean if I don't know where you would find it on the internet maybe if someone archived it somewhere on a website with an app named for the internet archive organizational website are you talking about?

135
00:10:17,121 --> 00:10:27,193
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to say this every version that I have attempted because I really wanted to play Paprium has been non-functional

136
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:38,483
[SPEAKER_03]: it's mostly functional from what I've heard now someone was selling theirs for like 800 bucks at CalX last year hmm

137
00:10:39,188 --> 00:10:51,453
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike Deft in chat brings up an interesting perspective saying a phrase I always hear when trying to justify piracy and specifically, especially for Nintendo stuff, excuse me, is it's morally correct to pirate Nintendo.

138
00:10:51,473 --> 00:10:58,227
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I don't know about that statement, but I do remember the perspective that Mike Deft lives in Mexico.

139
00:10:58,207 --> 00:11:03,875
[SPEAKER_07]: And from what I recall, and please correct me if I'm wrong, it's hard for me to keep tabs on every country in the world.

140
00:11:03,895 --> 00:11:11,685
[SPEAKER_07]: But if I recall, there was a big hubaloo because Nintendo does not have an official distribution presence in Mexico.

141
00:11:11,705 --> 00:11:16,872
[SPEAKER_07]: Therefore, everything in Mexico is way more expensive when it comes to the games.

142
00:11:17,312 --> 00:11:24,602
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it brings back to mind a sort of similar feeling I used to have in the PlayStation era.

143
00:11:24,582 --> 00:11:34,111
[SPEAKER_07]: When, you know, when I would pirate DDR games, and I didn't, I would buy, I would buy the ones they made for the US, I bought Konami, I bought US Mix, I bought Beatmania.

144
00:11:34,591 --> 00:11:39,515
[SPEAKER_07]: But when it came to like DDR, third mix, fourth mix, I pirated those and I did not apologize for it.

145
00:11:39,636 --> 00:11:47,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Because my perspective was, if, if Konami wanted me to buy those games, they would release them here in the US.

146
00:11:47,443 --> 00:11:51,786
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I do understand music licenses probably made some of that stuff difficult.

147
00:11:51,827 --> 00:11:53,968
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a better understanding of some of that now than I did then.

148
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:54,589
[SPEAKER_07]: But

149
00:11:54,569 --> 00:12:00,014
[SPEAKER_07]: I still would support DDR where I could when it was legally available for me to do so.

150
00:12:00,034 --> 00:12:01,516
[SPEAKER_06]: We bought the PC version.

151
00:12:01,656 --> 00:12:02,497
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, come on.

152
00:12:02,777 --> 00:12:03,538
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's true.

153
00:12:03,578 --> 00:12:05,220
[SPEAKER_06]: How much more can we support?

154
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,522
[SPEAKER_07]: We supported the Mr. Spanky DLC, okay?

155
00:12:07,582 --> 00:12:08,563
[SPEAKER_07]: How many people can say that?

156
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:08,803
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

157
00:12:09,684 --> 00:12:17,192
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike Deft in chat says, a Switch 2 with Mario Kart is almost $800 US dollars, maybe around $750.

158
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:20,695
[SPEAKER_07]: So I kind of...

159
00:12:20,675 --> 00:12:31,311
[SPEAKER_07]: I get it a little more from that perspective because it's like that's not fair that they should have to pay twice as much as we do in the U.S.

160
00:12:31,331 --> 00:12:34,195
[SPEAKER_07]: just because they don't have an official distribution system there.

161
00:12:34,536 --> 00:12:41,406
[SPEAKER_07]: So I understand where that gets a little bit trickier and probably where some of the justification for websites like this start to pop up.

162
00:12:41,426 --> 00:12:45,332
[SPEAKER_07]: However, if you are going to justify your piracy –

163
00:12:45,312 --> 00:13:07,118
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

164
00:13:07,098 --> 00:13:14,391
[SPEAKER_07]: I say in Deft's case, and people like Deft, like, you never had the opportunity to fairly buy the game anyway.

165
00:13:14,411 --> 00:13:16,455
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it is a different argument in that case.

166
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:27,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and I mean, and even saying that you should feel responsible for some of that, I don't, I mean, piracy isn't even enough to make a dent in game sales, I think, for the most part.

167
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:28,617
Yeah.

168
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I wouldn't feel bad about it, honestly.

169
00:13:31,864 --> 00:13:39,716
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it just... Especially with just how they're treating the industry with their pricing and stuff like that.

170
00:13:40,116 --> 00:13:41,398
[SPEAKER_06]: Certainly, they're trying.

171
00:13:41,739 --> 00:13:50,352
[SPEAKER_06]: They feel that they've earned this goodwill that they're going to now exploit and see what they can do to drum up more profits, but it's...

172
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:52,411
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

173
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:59,820
[SPEAKER_06]: I think if it's fairly priced and it's more convenient, like with Steam and stuff like that, it's a no-brainer.

174
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:09,832
[SPEAKER_06]: A perfect example, look at how many games I've purchased on Steam that I don't even play, but I purchased them anyways because they look interesting.

175
00:14:09,872 --> 00:14:16,660
[SPEAKER_06]: It's that kind of on-a-whim impulse buying that that platform lends itself to.

176
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:40,622
[SPEAKER_06]: an $80 game is not going to be an impulse buy for me so like it really needs to be good and that's the thing is a lot of these games and a lot of these you know studios looking to keep pushing that retail cost of that game up okay but my standards for your game are going to be a lot higher than every time you bump that price up my standards for what that game needs to be is going to be incredibly high and if we find that you just don't

177
00:14:41,632 --> 00:14:44,877
[SPEAKER_06]: Live up to those standards, then yeah, your games are going to fail.

178
00:14:45,838 --> 00:14:59,658
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there's a story we have we're going to be talking about a little bit about game delays and the whole thing with that, but one of the things that the complaints on there is like, well, yeah, but the previous game didn't do well, and it's these people's fault for that.

179
00:14:59,678 --> 00:15:05,767
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like, well, yeah, but if you look at what the complaints were on that previous game, it was the monetization in it, not the actual game itself.

180
00:15:05,827 --> 00:15:09,512
[SPEAKER_06]: It was how you shoved monetization in, and that was the publisher's.

181
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:12,168
[SPEAKER_07]: Charged $70 for a free-to-play game.

182
00:15:12,269 --> 00:15:13,476
[SPEAKER_07]: I've definitely heard that before.

183
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:14,724
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

184
00:15:14,744 --> 00:15:16,414
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, or, you know, there's...

185
00:15:17,221 --> 00:15:21,887
[SPEAKER_06]: There's games that have spent $800 million to be developed and still not done yet.

186
00:15:22,568 --> 00:15:25,091
[SPEAKER_06]: There's that type of stuff too.

187
00:15:25,411 --> 00:15:27,954
[SPEAKER_07]: I realize people have strong feelings on this issue.

188
00:15:28,215 --> 00:15:32,860
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, I don't endorse piracy of current stuff for most people.

189
00:15:33,081 --> 00:15:40,630
[SPEAKER_07]: I do try to understand the different angles because I also recognize it's a part of our industry we have to deal with.

190
00:15:41,183 --> 00:15:50,571
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we have to kind of figure out, I think if you want to get down to, you know, trying to be successful in the industry, you have to get down to the reasons of why do people do this.

191
00:15:50,591 --> 00:15:54,775
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, I think we just talked about one when it comes to the international folks, for sure.

192
00:15:54,795 --> 00:16:07,086
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, some of the, you know, distribution and, you know, do games, are they, you know, affordable, you know, based on local, you know, economies and so forth.

193
00:16:08,046 --> 00:16:09,908
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I think, you know, there's,

194
00:16:09,888 --> 00:16:15,478
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there are some people out there, though, that just pirate because they're trying to build up an impressive collection of stuff.

195
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:22,932
[SPEAKER_07]: And they have the means and whatever to support otherwise, and they are actively hurting the industry.

196
00:16:23,633 --> 00:16:27,981
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think game companies have to kind of think about how do they get around that.

197
00:16:27,961 --> 00:16:31,347
[SPEAKER_07]: and they try with things that are happening on the Switch too.

198
00:16:31,768 --> 00:16:33,732
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, we have a story coming up later.

199
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:40,725
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't mean to make this whole thing a teaser for later in the show, but it is what's going on this week that may be where that whole system is backfiring in a really bad way.

200
00:16:41,847 --> 00:16:44,232
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's just, it's...

201
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:47,337
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not something you can look away from and it will disappear.

202
00:16:47,858 --> 00:16:49,501
[SPEAKER_07]: It's something that's always going to be there.

203
00:16:49,581 --> 00:16:58,936
[SPEAKER_07]: We kind of have to figure out how do we live with this and how do we make people choose to do things the way that will make these companies money.

204
00:16:59,317 --> 00:17:02,963
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess maybe the best analogy I could give is Napster.

205
00:17:03,584 --> 00:17:11,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody used to download, well, not everybody, but most people used to download music all the time on Napster, MP3s, just albums, you name it.

206
00:17:12,233 --> 00:17:31,633
[SPEAKER_07]: And it wasn't until the record companies kind of figured out how to legitimize that sort of immediacy of Napster and a one-click purchase system, which really, I believe iTunes was the first to do that, that once, I know once iTunes became available, I used that and I stopped using Napster.

207
00:17:31,613 --> 00:17:54,786
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

208
00:17:55,137 --> 00:17:58,763
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the file stuff, but viruses are written per system.

209
00:17:59,084 --> 00:18:00,106
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I guess that's true.

210
00:18:00,587 --> 00:18:06,477
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, when you have, at the time, a small user base, no one on a Mac was worried.

211
00:18:06,497 --> 00:18:07,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't download executables.

212
00:18:08,661 --> 00:18:09,362
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah.

213
00:18:10,103 --> 00:18:10,564
[SPEAKER_07]: But...

214
00:18:10,544 --> 00:18:19,237
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just trying to make the point that it's like when this piracy was rampant everywhere, the industry sort of had to figure out how to embrace that.

215
00:18:19,257 --> 00:18:25,506
[SPEAKER_07]: And maybe to the point we were talking about earlier, maybe there needs to be a better system of worldwide distribution.

216
00:18:25,606 --> 00:18:29,953
[SPEAKER_07]: However, I keep contradicting myself tonight because we live in that kind of world.

217
00:18:30,473 --> 00:18:32,316
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't blame anybody.

218
00:18:32,296 --> 00:18:43,793
[SPEAKER_07]: for not trying to do distribution worldwide in a system that involves the US at this point in time because of everything fucky going on with tariffs and all that stuff.

219
00:18:43,813 --> 00:18:45,375
[SPEAKER_07]: So what a mess.

220
00:18:46,537 --> 00:18:47,038
[SPEAKER_07]: What a mess.

221
00:18:49,141 --> 00:18:51,624
[SPEAKER_06]: So like we said, this both sucks and blows.

222
00:18:52,706 --> 00:18:53,527
[SPEAKER_06]: We're getting it all back.

223
00:18:54,128 --> 00:18:54,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Uncontrollably.

224
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:55,751
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

225
00:18:55,771 --> 00:18:57,153
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let's talk about our gaming week.

226
00:18:57,173 --> 00:18:59,576
[SPEAKER_07]: So what were the types of video games that we were playing this week?

227
00:18:59,616 --> 00:19:00,818
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, we'll start with you.

228
00:19:02,232 --> 00:19:07,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Mass Effect, and Dead by Daylight, and Palia.

229
00:19:08,408 --> 00:19:10,052
[SPEAKER_03]: That's about it.

230
00:19:10,072 --> 00:19:15,786
[SPEAKER_03]: And believe it or not, I am going to have to become more of a gym rat.

231
00:19:18,078 --> 00:19:22,388
[SPEAKER_03]: I will try to find ways to gamify my workouts.

232
00:19:22,408 --> 00:19:26,537
[SPEAKER_03]: And if anyone has ideas apart from using Nerd Fitness, let me know.

233
00:19:26,557 --> 00:19:37,521
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to gamify my working out because I have to start doing one-sided deadlifts with a 50-pound kettlebell and I don't have a 50-pound kettlebell.

234
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:44,725
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really have a lot of advice except the one you already know, which is closing my Apple Rings.

235
00:19:45,066 --> 00:19:46,168
[SPEAKER_07]: I do that one.

236
00:19:46,188 --> 00:19:48,755
[SPEAKER_07]: But I've been going to the gym a couple times.

237
00:19:48,815 --> 00:19:50,058
[SPEAKER_07]: Not a lot, but a couple times.

238
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,645
[SPEAKER_07]: And I try to make sure I close my rings.

239
00:19:53,207 --> 00:19:54,410
[SPEAKER_03]: I work out at home.

240
00:19:54,811 --> 00:19:56,134
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, of course, go to ballet.

241
00:19:56,114 --> 00:20:26,121
[SPEAKER_03]: but and this is just more of like a life thing but you know I have that injury to my leg and I had been sitting down and doing a lot more gaming because I couldn't get up and really do a lot of stuff until I started physical therapy but now he says that I'm getting a lot stronger and I only have one more appointment left to do oh nice great yeah so I'm looking for I want to start actually doing the Pikmin thing since I downloaded it I just need a walking buddy not in this heat

242
00:20:27,653 --> 00:20:30,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Call me in September.

243
00:20:30,997 --> 00:20:34,121
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll walk inside an air-conditioned mall like the old folks.

244
00:20:34,161 --> 00:20:35,342
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

245
00:20:35,362 --> 00:20:37,885
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why mall walking is legit.

246
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:40,268
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know why mall walking is associated with old people.

247
00:20:40,368 --> 00:20:43,251
[SPEAKER_07]: Try living in Phoenix or here.

248
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,953
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, mall walking works.

249
00:20:45,093 --> 00:20:48,617
[SPEAKER_03]: We should do an 80s-style mall walk and everyone be all 80s.

250
00:20:48,637 --> 00:20:51,060
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like I've seen that on TikTok.

251
00:20:51,361 --> 00:20:52,682
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a club that does that.

252
00:20:52,702 --> 00:20:56,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably not here, but that does the 80s-style mall walking.

253
00:20:57,421 --> 00:21:24,677
[SPEAKER_06]: I would be so down yeah all right S2100 Matt says I went mall walking today see it's still still a good thing all right uh Loki I think it's your turn um well I just played Minecraft this week I put together a big giant arena a battle arena type thing uh so that was like over 100,000 block build or something like that so I got that done and now I am working on developing uh

254
00:21:25,315 --> 00:21:27,338
[SPEAKER_06]: Mob Waves that you would fight in it.

255
00:21:27,418 --> 00:21:33,727
[SPEAKER_06]: So kind of working with command blocks and stuff like that and designing what that's going to be and balancing all that stuff out.

256
00:21:33,867 --> 00:21:36,030
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's what I've been working on this week.

257
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:40,997
[SPEAKER_06]: That and, you know, between all that watching stuff on Summer Games so quick.

258
00:21:41,297 --> 00:21:42,479
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

259
00:21:42,499 --> 00:21:44,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have a particular run you really enjoyed?

260
00:21:45,243 --> 00:21:46,304
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the Bellator run.

261
00:21:46,324 --> 00:21:49,348
[SPEAKER_06]: I watched that where they did like eight different decks or whatever.

262
00:21:49,669 --> 00:21:51,471
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was interesting to see them play that.

263
00:21:51,692 --> 00:21:52,032
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

264
00:21:52,957 --> 00:21:55,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, my game of the week.

265
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:58,962
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of still on the ones I've been playing a lot recently.

266
00:21:58,982 --> 00:22:00,924
[SPEAKER_07]: Diablo 4, Season 9 is continuing.

267
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:03,326
[SPEAKER_07]: I did hit level 60 and I'm in the Paragon levels now.

268
00:22:03,366 --> 00:22:04,628
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm up to about Paragon 30.

269
00:22:04,988 --> 00:22:13,436
[SPEAKER_07]: I just got to Torment 1, so just working on my character for the season and trying to unlock all the silly things that I like to do in that game.

270
00:22:14,156 --> 00:22:17,239
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, a little bit of Final Fantasy XIV, but just a little bit.

271
00:22:17,259 --> 00:22:20,382
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I'm just kind of at the point where I'm waiting for the next patch, to be quite honest.

272
00:22:20,362 --> 00:22:24,531
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I'm just waiting for the next expansion to be quite real.

273
00:22:24,732 --> 00:22:27,297
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know a nice way to say this.

274
00:22:27,357 --> 00:22:29,823
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Dawn Trail has just kind of been a bit of a flop.

275
00:22:30,865 --> 00:22:34,092
[SPEAKER_07]: But the bar for Final Fantasy XIV is also very high.

276
00:22:34,673 --> 00:22:40,125
[SPEAKER_07]: I just think that game has been so good for so long that it's not that...

277
00:22:40,105 --> 00:23:06,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Dawn Trail is necessarily like a bad game it's just bad for this game um and it just it hasn't it hasn't really lured me back in the way most of the other expansions did to be quite honest um but there's still I'm still paying for a sub so I still am signing in occasionally to try to get an upgrade to the house I'm still trying to get my crafting to 100 and at some point I'll want to get all my jobs up to 100 but I'm just kind of waiting for the rest of the systems to

278
00:23:06,025 --> 00:23:28,708
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob, after five minutes, were you like, let's get it?

279
00:23:28,688 --> 00:23:31,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, but then, uh, let's see.

280
00:23:31,071 --> 00:23:31,672
[SPEAKER_07]: I've also been playing.

281
00:23:31,792 --> 00:23:36,818
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, but you know, I have been, I've been speaking of emulation and all that.

282
00:23:36,978 --> 00:23:41,624
[SPEAKER_07]: I have been living it up and my dolphin emulator playing fantasy star online.

283
00:23:41,744 --> 00:23:42,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

284
00:23:42,205 --> 00:23:46,230
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm playing fantasy star online game cube, uh, via the emulator.

285
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,953
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, there's a server that you can connect to for that.

286
00:23:48,973 --> 00:23:51,456
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've been playing with friends just a little bit, uh,

287
00:23:51,436 --> 00:24:14,794
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

288
00:24:14,774 --> 00:24:40,663
[SPEAKER_07]: I beat all the forests, I beat the dragon and now I'm working on the caves and god those quests get so much longer once you get to the caves because of the fact that those rooms just constantly spawn those fucking shark things over and over and over and over again but yeah PSO is still fun 20 years actually more than 20 years after that because the original was 25 years ago probably so I'm thinking about the GameCube version but yeah

289
00:24:40,643 --> 00:25:00,103
[SPEAKER_07]: PSO for life literally um I think that's about that's about it fantasy life I'm gonna finish that hopefully in the coming days all right uh we are going to get into some more news we got a lot of gaming headlines for you so let's get to it Loki what is on deck for gaming news tonight

290
00:25:00,809 --> 00:25:20,674
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I'll go for a walk I feel happy

291
00:25:21,616 --> 00:25:48,214
[SPEAKER_06]: their funding obviously was pulled for their game and it was cancelled but they're now looking for other studio partners to work with to develop stuff so that's good and maybe at least the game will get brought back in another studio or something like that or maybe they can spin it into something, who knows but at the very least Romero Games is not closed so that's good that's good

292
00:25:50,523 --> 00:25:59,082
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's very good but are they gonna so if the funding for their game got cut are they still gonna be able to release that though?

293
00:25:59,281 --> 00:26:00,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I don't know.

294
00:26:01,183 --> 00:26:07,231
[SPEAKER_06]: They said the project funding was pulled and their game was cancelled.

295
00:26:07,591 --> 00:26:15,061
[SPEAKER_06]: It says, due to confidentiality agreements, we cannot disclose the publisher's identity, though some may infer from the public information.

296
00:26:15,341 --> 00:26:15,781
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

297
00:26:16,743 --> 00:26:20,988
[SPEAKER_06]: It says, as a result, we have now had to reassess our entire staffing from our studio.

298
00:26:21,549 --> 00:26:28,377
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember, our game does not close, and we're doing everything in our power to ensure that it does not come to that.

299
00:26:28,357 --> 00:26:31,967
[SPEAKER_06]: and any suggestion otherwise is factually incorrect.

300
00:26:31,987 --> 00:26:33,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

301
00:26:33,913 --> 00:26:34,334
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm.

302
00:26:34,354 --> 00:26:40,130
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting, except, you know, so it's like this game you know nothing about had something happen to it and we can't talk about it.

303
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:42,918
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's the news.

304
00:26:42,938 --> 00:26:43,159
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

305
00:26:43,983 --> 00:26:59,882
[SPEAKER_07]: at least they're trying I know, I know obviously we don't take delight in any studio really closing so it's good to hear that they're still at it so best of luck to them with whatever direction they end up going in but yeah, the

306
00:26:59,862 --> 00:27:17,483
[SPEAKER_07]: Those Microsoft closures really were a

307
00:27:17,463 --> 00:27:23,193
[SPEAKER_07]: You now have the labeled and standardized accessibility tags available to you.

308
00:27:23,213 --> 00:27:30,004
[SPEAKER_07]: We had talked about this before that Microsoft was going to be incorporating these into the Microsoft Store, but they are out now.

309
00:27:30,545 --> 00:27:37,136
[SPEAKER_07]: The goal is to, quote, provide players with clear and consistent information about the accessibility features in video games.

310
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:42,525
[SPEAKER_07]: So for an example, let's take a game like South of Midnight, which is a relatively recent release.

311
00:27:42,505 --> 00:27:59,586
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

312
00:27:59,566 --> 00:28:11,319
[SPEAKER_07]: Visual features feature color alternatives, camera comfort, large and clear subtitles, and then input features include adjustable input sensitivity and playable without button holds.

313
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,588
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's all I can read in the little screenshot.

314
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:31,480
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, Luke,

315
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:37,167
[SPEAKER_07]: maybe on-demand tutorials, that more strikes me as like a Bobby Blackwolf mode type of thing in a game.

316
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:41,994
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm not shading it whatsoever because I'm kind of thinking like, oh, I do like it.

317
00:28:42,094 --> 00:28:55,251
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, have you ever, and I'm sure you've all done this, have you ever played a game for like five hours, then you got distracted by something else, and you went back to that first game and you're like, I don't remember what the buttons do in this game.

318
00:28:55,431 --> 00:28:56,753
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember how to play this game.

319
00:28:57,233 --> 00:28:58,816
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess I'll have to start over.

320
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:00,758
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

321
00:29:01,936 --> 00:29:25,615
[SPEAKER_07]: I do that all of the time all of the time ask me why I've played Pokemon Sword and Shield like seven times at this point and haven't beaten it yet or not Sword and Shield sorry um Scarlet and Violet like seven times at this point and still haven't beaten it so on demand when I've like forgot like not how to play it but just like I barely started this game I'm just gonna start it over again yeah

322
00:29:26,219 --> 00:29:31,949
[SPEAKER_07]: So, well, I see a few people in chat, Fifth Dream and Bobby Blackwolf, ironically, are both with me saying all the time.

323
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:32,751
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

324
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:33,532
[SPEAKER_07]: So it does happen.

325
00:29:33,552 --> 00:29:33,893
[SPEAKER_07]: It does happen.

326
00:29:34,474 --> 00:29:39,603
[SPEAKER_07]: The standardized tags, this is being managed by the Entertainment Software Association.

327
00:29:39,663 --> 00:29:42,969
[SPEAKER_07]: So file this under good things that the ESA have done.

328
00:29:43,009 --> 00:29:46,656
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a very small file, but this is important to put in it.

329
00:29:46,676 --> 00:29:46,776
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

330
00:29:46,756 --> 00:29:56,244
[SPEAKER_07]: Input from companies included Nintendo, EA, Ubisoft, Sony, Microsoft, Amazon Games, Riot Games, Square Enix, and Warner Brothers Game have all signed on to the project.

331
00:29:56,524 --> 00:29:59,086
[SPEAKER_07]: There are 24 accessibility tags.

332
00:29:59,947 --> 00:30:03,450
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo and Sony have not yet updated their stores with these tags.

333
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:06,513
[SPEAKER_07]: Microsoft is the first of the big three to do so.

334
00:30:06,933 --> 00:30:08,735
[SPEAKER_07]: So very interesting.

335
00:30:08,755 --> 00:30:11,717
[SPEAKER_07]: But I would imagine the other stores will follow soon.

336
00:30:11,737 --> 00:30:16,341
[SPEAKER_07]: So very cool feature for people that are looking for...

337
00:30:16,321 --> 00:30:18,984
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, specific accessibility needs in certain games.

338
00:30:19,465 --> 00:30:28,856
[SPEAKER_07]: So curious to see how this develops and really translates to, you know, allowing more people to play a game they may not otherwise have.

339
00:30:29,517 --> 00:30:29,718
[SPEAKER_07]: So.

340
00:30:31,199 --> 00:30:31,460
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

341
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:31,640
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

342
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,425
[SPEAKER_07]: S2100 Matt says, every once in a while, the ESA gets one clap.

343
00:30:35,585 --> 00:30:36,566
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

344
00:30:36,586 --> 00:30:38,589
[SPEAKER_07]: A broken clock is still right twice a day.

345
00:30:38,629 --> 00:30:40,331
[SPEAKER_07]: We all know that old adage, right?

346
00:30:40,431 --> 00:30:43,054
[SPEAKER_07]: So, but I would say, I feel like the ESA...

347
00:30:44,333 --> 00:30:46,475
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like they've had more wins lately.

348
00:30:46,695 --> 00:30:56,344
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I feel like the last year especially, I've been like, okay, this isn't the end of the... This isn't alright to do, but maybe it was all stories related to this.

349
00:30:57,085 --> 00:30:57,886
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't doubt that.

350
00:30:57,906 --> 00:30:59,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe something lit the fire.

351
00:30:59,227 --> 00:30:59,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

352
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:01,189
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's always a possibility.

353
00:31:01,329 --> 00:31:01,669
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.

354
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:03,071
[SPEAKER_07]: Who knows?

355
00:31:03,091 --> 00:31:03,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

356
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:04,432
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

357
00:31:04,832 --> 00:31:10,337
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of people who should have a fire lit... We still have the industry doing a lot of crappy things though, right, Jamie?

358
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:12,079
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be soft.

359
00:31:12,447 --> 00:31:12,908
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yes.

360
00:31:13,409 --> 00:31:31,601
[SPEAKER_03]: So Ubisoft, even though they just got the $1.25 billion Tencent investment, they've laid off 19 workers at Star Trek Bridge Crew and a Tom Clancy game, Red Storm, for Ubisoft Red Storm.

361
00:31:32,061 --> 00:31:32,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

362
00:31:33,364 --> 00:31:33,684
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

363
00:31:34,946 --> 00:31:36,970
[SPEAKER_03]: But they are like...

364
00:31:37,321 --> 00:31:40,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, yeah, it's part of our restructuring program.

365
00:31:40,047 --> 00:31:43,534
[SPEAKER_03]: We made the decision to eliminate 19 roles at Red Storm Entertainment.

366
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:46,360
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the quote.

367
00:31:47,302 --> 00:31:48,745
[SPEAKER_03]: At least that's how I understood it.

368
00:31:48,785 --> 00:31:51,151
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's just summarized for context.

369
00:31:51,171 --> 00:31:53,796
[SPEAKER_03]: They say, this is not an easy decision.

370
00:31:53,977 --> 00:31:56,943
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a necessary one given our operational priorities.

371
00:31:57,163 --> 00:31:57,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Blah, blah.

372
00:31:58,381 --> 00:32:22,178
[SPEAKER_03]: um severance packages blowing you know smoke up their ass that kind of thing um they said that no other locations were impacted by the layoffs but they didn't comment when asked for more information about the head count um for uh for Red Storm and their projects so um yeah um

373
00:32:23,592 --> 00:32:41,217
[SPEAKER_03]: But they got all this money from Tencent, so... I mean, I understand it being an ongoing restructuring, but even so, when they have an influx of money, then should they not reevaluate that plan?

374
00:32:41,517 --> 00:32:45,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless this influx of money was a calculated part of that plan, I don't know.

375
00:32:46,304 --> 00:32:50,089
[SPEAKER_03]: But... I'm just like...

376
00:32:51,335 --> 00:33:05,312
[SPEAKER_07]: You do wish some of these companies would see that they could do a morally nice thing, correct thing I would even argue, by, you know, let's say you have these 19 people on Star Trek Bridge Crew, which I understand that game's been out a little while now.

377
00:33:05,873 --> 00:33:09,197
[SPEAKER_07]: VR gaming hasn't exactly launched into the stratosphere.

378
00:33:09,717 --> 00:33:12,060
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, you know, it's kind of there.

379
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:21,474
[SPEAKER_07]: Although, you know, Beat Saber's still doing its thing, because I saw some of that during Summer Games Done Quick, too, and that was fun to watch.

380
00:33:21,534 --> 00:33:24,619
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say, they stopped their support for that game, but I know it.

381
00:33:24,779 --> 00:33:30,167
[SPEAKER_07]: On PlayStation, but that's because it's a meta thing now, so Facebook wants it all to itself.

382
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:41,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Other stuff, you know, I mean, this was a studio in North Carolina, but we're also dealing with a lot of video game related research losing their funding.

383
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:48,378
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of schools losing their funding for their programs because of the turd in chief.

384
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:49,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm hmm.

385
00:33:50,330 --> 00:34:01,302
[SPEAKER_03]: and you know library services losing their funding which also we're doing some cataloging of games so it's it's really not a good time

386
00:34:01,484 --> 00:34:25,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, just to quickly finish my thought too on what I wish Ubisoft would have done, if you know you're going to lay off these 19 people on this one game, why can't you invest just a little bit into the learning or the development of these folks to be able to put them on another project, to be able to assign them to another, you know, it's not like Ubisoft doesn't have tons of other projects out there that could use a little help in moving along.

387
00:34:25,088 --> 00:34:27,330
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just, it's just, it's unfortunate.

388
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:27,690
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

389
00:34:27,931 --> 00:34:28,111
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

390
00:34:28,391 --> 00:34:28,791
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

391
00:34:28,952 --> 00:34:29,432
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

392
00:34:29,412 --> 00:34:30,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at who's in charge.

393
00:34:30,514 --> 00:34:32,577
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

394
00:34:32,597 --> 00:34:35,982
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say in charge of what, but it doesn't matter either way you slice it.

395
00:34:36,463 --> 00:34:36,904
[SPEAKER_07]: I get it.

396
00:34:37,104 --> 00:34:42,953
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, but it's just... Yeah, and I'm sure the investors are happy because at the end of the day, it's more money in their pocket.

397
00:34:43,494 --> 00:34:45,437
[SPEAKER_07]: But, like, I don't know.

398
00:34:45,897 --> 00:34:46,358
[SPEAKER_07]: Just...

399
00:34:47,468 --> 00:34:54,042
[SPEAKER_07]: When in the fuck are billionaires going to start to feel the heat for once?

400
00:34:54,343 --> 00:34:56,107
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I would like to know.

401
00:34:56,407 --> 00:34:57,550
[SPEAKER_06]: We start eating them.

402
00:34:57,930 --> 00:34:58,692
[SPEAKER_06]: Yummy, yummy.

403
00:34:58,953 --> 00:35:07,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe when people walk in higher force and with torches.

404
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:09,014
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying.

405
00:35:09,034 --> 00:35:11,599
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just, it's a crazy world we live in.

406
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:12,401
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

407
00:35:13,202 --> 00:35:13,743
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on.

408
00:35:13,763 --> 00:35:14,525
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's talk about.

409
00:35:14,565 --> 00:35:16,529
[SPEAKER_03]: Stupid world we live in is what it is.

410
00:35:16,549 --> 00:35:17,871
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a crazy, stupid world.

411
00:35:19,695 --> 00:35:24,985
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, let's talk about deals going, you know, deals for the rest of us going away.

412
00:35:25,488 --> 00:35:33,503
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you know, Nintendo used to have this thing, this voucher program where you'd pay $100 and it'd allow you to get two Nintendo games.

413
00:35:33,523 --> 00:35:39,514
[SPEAKER_06]: Saving you a little bit of money because, you know, the games were like $60 or, you know, in some cases now $70.

414
00:35:39,635 --> 00:35:46,427
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, that was a savings of potentially $40 if you played your cards right.

415
00:35:47,309 --> 00:35:47,850
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

416
00:35:48,168 --> 00:36:01,587
[SPEAKER_06]: So Nintendo, you know, I guess thinking that somehow devaluing their $80 games, says, uh-uh-uh, we're gonna kill this, and it's going away January 2026.

417
00:36:02,309 --> 00:36:13,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's my question with all that, because this part would make a little more sense.

418
00:36:13,587 --> 00:36:18,394
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you able to use those Nintendo vouchers on Switch 2 games?

419
00:36:18,374 --> 00:36:25,424
[SPEAKER_07]: or are you using Nintendo vouchers on Switch 1 games and you are still going to have to pay the upgrade fee?

420
00:36:25,444 --> 00:36:32,854
[SPEAKER_07]: Because remember, Metroid Prime 4 and Pokemon ZA Legends, blah, blah, blah, are original Switch games, technically.

421
00:36:32,874 --> 00:36:36,379
[SPEAKER_07]: I would never want to play Pokemon Legends ZA on an original Switch.

422
00:36:36,479 --> 00:36:37,040
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

423
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,903
[SPEAKER_07]: The original cries enough.

424
00:36:38,963 --> 00:36:42,247
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't imagine what a shitshow Z to A is going to be.

425
00:36:42,267 --> 00:36:43,810
[SPEAKER_07]: But on the Switch 2, I'm sure it'll be great.

426
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:44,871
[SPEAKER_07]: But...

427
00:36:44,851 --> 00:37:01,020
[SPEAKER_07]: if these vouchers only work on the original Nintendo Switch then I could see that maybe Nintendo is sunsetting them simply because there are not going to be as many original Switch first party titles coming like we know Tomodachi Life but that's probably the end of it

428
00:37:02,148 --> 00:37:06,313
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, right now it's basically talking about with the Switch vouchers.

429
00:37:06,373 --> 00:37:08,756
[SPEAKER_06]: It says, what are Nintendo Switch vouchers?

430
00:37:08,796 --> 00:37:09,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Blah, blah, blah.

431
00:37:09,297 --> 00:37:17,387
[SPEAKER_06]: It says that they, you know, obviously they purchased in sets of two and cannot be redeemed for Nintendo Switch 2 games.

432
00:37:17,407 --> 00:37:19,329
[SPEAKER_07]: So yes, you do have a point.

433
00:37:19,349 --> 00:37:21,632
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's what it is.

434
00:37:22,052 --> 00:37:30,703
[SPEAKER_07]: And you should be aware if you use this to get Metroid Prime 4 and

435
00:37:30,683 --> 00:37:49,249
[SPEAKER_07]: Pokemon Legends CA you're going to have to buy the upgrades so you're going to have to math this out and see if this still saves you money because the question would be are they $20 upgrades or are they $10 upgrades because if they're $10 upgrades you would probably save money if they're $20 upgrades you might not

436
00:37:49,229 --> 00:37:57,239
[SPEAKER_06]: It says they said spending $120 on vouchers and upgrades instead of the $140 is what they would normally be.

437
00:37:57,259 --> 00:38:00,202
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm guessing the upgrades are $10 then?

438
00:38:00,623 --> 00:38:01,203
[SPEAKER_07]: That makes sense.

439
00:38:01,223 --> 00:38:03,226
[SPEAKER_07]: I just couldn't remember how much they were for the Zeldas.

440
00:38:03,366 --> 00:38:05,669
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought there were $20 for the Zelda games.

441
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:07,070
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

442
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:07,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.

443
00:38:07,811 --> 00:38:09,213
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I don't know.

444
00:38:09,233 --> 00:38:10,735
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't keep track of it anymore.

445
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:13,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because the system is too complicated.

446
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:15,220
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

447
00:38:16,803 --> 00:38:22,774
[SPEAKER_06]: That sucks, but I don't know if they're going to come out with anything similar to that for Switch 2.

448
00:38:23,275 --> 00:38:26,161
[SPEAKER_07]: DEF says $10 for Switch 2 upgrades.

449
00:38:26,742 --> 00:38:31,110
[SPEAKER_07]: So then it would still save you money because you would buy the vouchers.

450
00:38:31,431 --> 00:38:37,562
[SPEAKER_07]: Just like you said, it's $120 for the voucher way and $140 if you don't do the voucher way.

451
00:38:37,542 --> 00:38:40,165
[SPEAKER_07]: for Prime and Pokemon ZA.

452
00:38:40,626 --> 00:38:48,016
[SPEAKER_07]: So I have to think about if I might want to do this, actually, because my coworkers were kind enough to gift me $100 in Nintendo credit.

453
00:38:48,437 --> 00:38:51,761
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just kind of assumed I was going to get Donkey Kong Bananas with it.

454
00:38:53,403 --> 00:38:57,829
[SPEAKER_07]: But now I'm like, ooh, maybe I want to get the vouchers so that I can get Prime 4

455
00:38:57,809 --> 00:39:02,634
[SPEAKER_07]: and that because essentially my coworkers graciously already bought me that.

456
00:39:02,714 --> 00:39:05,036
[SPEAKER_07]: So really, I'd only be paying the 20 bucks to upgrade them.

457
00:39:05,296 --> 00:39:09,600
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess and those are games I know I'm going to play the heck out of.

458
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:12,743
[SPEAKER_07]: So the question is, am I going to be suckered into an impulse buy with Donkey Kong?

459
00:39:13,023 --> 00:39:13,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably.

460
00:39:13,844 --> 00:39:14,645
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's be real with ourselves.

461
00:39:14,665 --> 00:39:15,105
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably.

462
00:39:15,185 --> 00:39:16,146
[SPEAKER_07]: I probably will.

463
00:39:16,166 --> 00:39:20,570
[SPEAKER_07]: I probably I still want to get Bravely Default 2 or Bravely Default for Switch 2, which I still haven't purchased.

464
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:25,835
[SPEAKER_07]: So because I'm forcing myself to beat some games I already own first, like Fantasy Life.

465
00:39:26,556 --> 00:39:27,597
[SPEAKER_07]: So.

466
00:39:28,336 --> 00:39:28,716
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

467
00:39:29,277 --> 00:39:31,320
[SPEAKER_07]: S2100 Matt says, Rob has nice coworkers.

468
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:31,820
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I do.

469
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,182
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually thought that was really cool.

470
00:39:33,502 --> 00:39:35,404
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and we try, we kind of tried to do that.

471
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:39,149
[SPEAKER_07]: We know people's interests, like, you know, so we'll try to get a gift card.

472
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:45,076
[SPEAKER_07]: If we know their interest, if we don't, then there's always like, you know, an Amazon card or a, you know, coffee, something.

473
00:39:45,096 --> 00:39:50,082
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, they knew that I was a gamer, probably because my boss has listened to this show before.

474
00:39:50,543 --> 00:39:51,884
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, if you're out there listening.

475
00:39:53,426 --> 00:39:54,027
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that, Jamie?

476
00:39:55,148 --> 00:39:56,790
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, hi, Rob's boss.

477
00:39:59,065 --> 00:40:00,086
[SPEAKER_07]: Give them a raise.

478
00:40:00,286 --> 00:40:09,295
[SPEAKER_07]: No, the thing that I like is that work – and this was true about one of my older jobs too that I had.

479
00:40:09,315 --> 00:40:11,897
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm very fortunate because this show has been on so damn long.

480
00:40:11,917 --> 00:40:15,261
[SPEAKER_07]: I've had multiple jobs during the course of being on this show.

481
00:40:15,661 --> 00:40:28,093
[SPEAKER_07]: But the thing that's in common with my current employer as well as an employer I've had in the past is that my boss would recognize that the skills that I use to put on this –

482
00:40:28,073 --> 00:40:36,604
[SPEAKER_07]: could be things that lend themselves in the workplace, such as we might be looking at trying to do a podcast at work.

483
00:40:36,624 --> 00:40:41,050
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe Rob is somebody that knows a little something about that.

484
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:45,095
[SPEAKER_07]: Or at my old job, it was Rob uses all those tech things.

485
00:40:45,115 --> 00:40:46,978
[SPEAKER_07]: We should get him into e-learning development.

486
00:40:46,998 --> 00:40:49,421
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's how I got my foot in the door when it came to e-learning development.

487
00:40:49,461 --> 00:40:51,904
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's...

488
00:40:51,884 --> 00:40:57,436
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I'm very happy when an employer can sort of recognize those sort of strengths.

489
00:40:57,476 --> 00:41:13,048
[SPEAKER_07]: But I have also been fortunate and privileged enough to work at places that I do feel like do the morally correct thing we were talking about earlier and make those types of investment in their workforces to make stronger employees, which unfortunately in the video game industry... That's why I like where I work.

490
00:41:13,028 --> 00:41:13,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exactly.

491
00:41:13,809 --> 00:41:15,812
[SPEAKER_07]: It leads to happy employees.

492
00:41:15,832 --> 00:41:23,764
[SPEAKER_07]: But unfortunately with so many companies in the video game industry, not all, it wouldn't be fair to say all, but so many companies in the video game industry is not the case.

493
00:41:24,085 --> 00:41:27,009
[SPEAKER_07]: People are just expendable and it's just, it's very unfortunate.

494
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:29,653
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah.

495
00:41:30,443 --> 00:41:31,084
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, anyway.

496
00:41:31,324 --> 00:41:34,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people enjoy money more than other people.

497
00:41:34,608 --> 00:41:37,691
[SPEAKER_07]: S2100 Matt says, treating employees well, crazy talk, Rob.

498
00:41:37,711 --> 00:41:38,312
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, right?

499
00:41:38,372 --> 00:41:49,225
[SPEAKER_07]: But to put things in perspective, I worked at that former company for 14 years until the writing was on the wall that our jobs were going to be sent to another country.

500
00:41:49,645 --> 00:41:50,446
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I left.

501
00:41:50,987 --> 00:41:55,852
[SPEAKER_07]: And my current employer, I'll stay at until I'm 65 if they'll have me, quite honestly.

502
00:41:56,293 --> 00:41:57,274
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't plan to leave.

503
00:41:57,775 --> 00:41:59,016
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

504
00:41:59,215 --> 00:42:18,304
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm planning on staying where I am I'll tell you what, me talking about how I like to make spreadsheets to track my progress in some of the games I play actually did get me an assignment so I was very happy I'm doing that with Pokemon Go and Shinies You should see my Dead by Daylight tracking list

505
00:42:18,335 --> 00:42:19,996
[SPEAKER_07]: The funniest fucking thing.

506
00:42:20,017 --> 00:42:28,604
[SPEAKER_07]: I finally caved and bought an office subscription because I wanted PowerPoint for the thing we did at Southern Fried Gaming Expo.

507
00:42:28,624 --> 00:42:38,033
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, and the reality is because I use PowerPoint so fucking much in my day job, I was like, I can't do this open office stuff anymore.

508
00:42:38,173 --> 00:42:40,295
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't do the Apple thing.

509
00:42:40,335 --> 00:42:41,436
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't use enough, Jamie.

510
00:42:41,556 --> 00:42:42,697
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't use it enough.

511
00:42:42,717 --> 00:42:45,159
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I was like, I need to be able to do this fast.

512
00:42:45,179 --> 00:42:48,342
[SPEAKER_07]: So in times when you need the- Why don't you just get something-

513
00:42:48,322 --> 00:42:50,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Go with what you know.

514
00:42:50,546 --> 00:42:50,927
[SPEAKER_07]: With what?

515
00:42:52,249 --> 00:42:55,595
[SPEAKER_03]: OpenOffice or LibreOffice work exactly the same as PowerPoint.

516
00:42:55,815 --> 00:42:56,737
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they do not.

517
00:42:57,077 --> 00:42:57,698
[SPEAKER_07]: No, they don't.

518
00:42:57,839 --> 00:42:58,860
[SPEAKER_07]: I just said why.

519
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:03,629
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the muscle memory that I have with PowerPoint doesn't work with OpenOffice.

520
00:43:03,929 --> 00:43:08,918
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I can tell you, I do this show role in OpenOffice, whatever their version of Excel is.

521
00:43:09,038 --> 00:43:09,459
[SPEAKER_07]: Numbers?

522
00:43:09,499 --> 00:43:10,480
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what they call it.

523
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:11,983
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever the OpenOffice is.

524
00:43:11,963 --> 00:43:13,284
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Numbers is Apple.

525
00:43:13,705 --> 00:43:14,346
[SPEAKER_07]: Sheets.

526
00:43:14,366 --> 00:43:15,447
[SPEAKER_07]: Sheets.

527
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:16,068
[SPEAKER_07]: Holy sheets.

528
00:43:16,428 --> 00:43:21,273
[SPEAKER_07]: I do the show but then like honestly, but now I did a Pokemon Go.

529
00:43:21,394 --> 00:43:22,415
[SPEAKER_07]: I have my shiny.

530
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:40,715
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm making a spreadsheet for all of my shinies so I can show what I'm willing to trade at a moment's notice in Excel because I just, again, when you spend so much time in Excel at your day job, I swear to God I can do it two times faster, three times faster in that than trying to use another program.

531
00:43:41,316 --> 00:43:41,616
[SPEAKER_07]: So,

532
00:43:41,596 --> 00:44:04,650
[SPEAKER_07]: I do much better presentations though with numbers and and keynote but which which is also am embedded in both of those with the projects I'm on I'm not saying I'm loyal to Excel because I love Microsoft I'm loyal to Excel because that's what my company chose to use during the day so that's what I know so it's that that's what it is yeah yeah if you want to use if you want to use the you know the boring

533
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:05,551
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, whatever.

534
00:44:06,413 --> 00:44:08,356
[SPEAKER_07]: S the show and Hunter Matt says, Shane taught you well.

535
00:44:08,376 --> 00:44:09,858
[SPEAKER_07]: This had nothing to do with Shane, actually.

536
00:44:09,878 --> 00:44:12,281
[SPEAKER_07]: I even texted him saying, you'd be proud of me.

537
00:44:12,302 --> 00:44:13,744
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm making a spreadsheet for Pokemon.

538
00:44:14,385 --> 00:44:16,247
[SPEAKER_07]: Def said, you made a spreadsheet for shinies.

539
00:44:16,267 --> 00:44:18,010
[SPEAKER_07]: You're deep and shiny hunting it seems now.

540
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:19,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it's for Pokemon Go.

541
00:44:19,552 --> 00:44:27,865
[SPEAKER_07]: And because it's all in the office thing, I can send people a OneDrive link when we turn lucky friends and I can say like, here's my shiny list.

542
00:44:27,885 --> 00:44:31,971
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's in green, I have three or more and I'm willing to trade.

543
00:44:33,115 --> 00:44:39,804
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's yellow, I have two or more and I might be willing to trade for something that I'm missing type of thing.

544
00:44:39,904 --> 00:44:41,446
[SPEAKER_07]: So I have my whole little system.

545
00:44:41,486 --> 00:44:44,330
[SPEAKER_07]: So now when I go lucky friends and people are like, what do you have?

546
00:44:44,471 --> 00:44:46,854
[SPEAKER_07]: I can send a list and be like, here, this is what I have.

547
00:44:46,894 --> 00:44:47,595
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what I don't have.

548
00:44:47,995 --> 00:44:48,236
[SPEAKER_07]: Done.

549
00:44:48,596 --> 00:44:50,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a detailed spreadsheet outlining everything.

550
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:52,702
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'm a gamer.

551
00:44:54,004 --> 00:44:58,009
[SPEAKER_03]: And people's eyes close over and they're like, what in the corporate America is this?

552
00:45:01,735 --> 00:45:03,678
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, where the hell were we?

553
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:06,023
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, we're going to get to this story about Nintendo.

554
00:45:06,363 --> 00:45:10,570
[SPEAKER_07]: So this isn't cute, and this plays into something we were talking about at the beginning of the show.

555
00:45:10,591 --> 00:45:20,588
[SPEAKER_07]: And this has to do with a Nintendo Switch 2 user who is claiming to be banned from their Switch 2 for a fault that they're saying is not their own.

556
00:45:20,568 --> 00:45:47,419
[SPEAKER_07]: so here's the thing it is an owner that posted on reddit and usually you would take these reddit stories and go does that make it true but thinking through this is where you have to bring in the wheel of plausibility thinking of everything this guy this this individual i should say this guy this individual is talking about it certainly adds up it adds up with everything we know about nintendo system and the way things work and it's worth talking about so here it is

557
00:45:47,753 --> 00:45:56,248
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, they downloaded patches for Switch game cards, Switch 1 cards, that they bought off a Facebook marketplace.

558
00:45:56,268 --> 00:45:57,631
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there's your first mistake.

559
00:45:57,871 --> 00:46:00,095
[SPEAKER_07]: Never buy anything off Facebook marketplace.

560
00:46:00,175 --> 00:46:01,598
[SPEAKER_07]: That place is a shithole.

561
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:02,860
[SPEAKER_07]: But...

562
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:07,735
[SPEAKER_07]: I know people have used it successfully.

563
00:46:07,755 --> 00:46:10,999
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure chat is correcting me as I'm speaking.

564
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:14,664
[SPEAKER_06]: I purchased a DDR machine off of Facebook Marketplace.

565
00:46:15,285 --> 00:46:17,608
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what a cesspool it can be there too.

566
00:46:17,748 --> 00:46:19,751
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to be very, very careful.

567
00:46:19,831 --> 00:46:20,893
[SPEAKER_07]: Buyer or seller.

568
00:46:21,033 --> 00:46:24,257
[SPEAKER_03]: One key word, Facebook.

569
00:46:25,570 --> 00:46:27,472
[SPEAKER_07]: That is a key part of the problem.

570
00:46:28,093 --> 00:46:30,997
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, Craigslist felt safer.

571
00:46:31,017 --> 00:46:34,441
[SPEAKER_07]: But here we are in this day and age where a lot of people are using Facebook Marketplace.

572
00:46:34,561 --> 00:46:37,886
[SPEAKER_07]: But it actually, at the end of the day, it doesn't matter where he bought it.

573
00:46:37,946 --> 00:46:47,658
[SPEAKER_07]: But the user on Reddit said they put the game into their Switch 2 to patch, but found out their online services were restricted the day after.

574
00:46:47,678 --> 00:46:53,105
[SPEAKER_07]: The Switch 2 user then called Nintendo, where they discovered they were banned.

575
00:46:53,125 --> 00:46:53,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Banned.

576
00:46:53,245 --> 00:47:08,622
[SPEAKER_07]: and DarkSakura.com.

577
00:47:08,602 --> 00:47:30,745
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

578
00:47:30,725 --> 00:47:39,604
[SPEAKER_07]: and then resell that physical game card so that's where you have to get a little distrusting of places like Facebook Marketplace you don't know if the card you're buying is even legit in the first place

579
00:47:40,748 --> 00:47:50,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, once Nintendo detects two instances of the unique code being online at the same time, it's going to ban any account that's using it.

580
00:47:50,183 --> 00:47:54,529
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, you know, if you are pirating Nintendo software, you know what's going on.

581
00:47:54,650 --> 00:48:09,152
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you're buying things secondhand, especially in a place full of casual buyers like Facebook, you may not know that this cartridge is actually a burned, essentially, image from online, and it may get your Switch 2 bricked.

582
00:48:10,904 --> 00:48:18,805
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, after proving that they bought the Switch games, the Redditors said they were told the cartridges are fine and able to be resold.

583
00:48:18,825 --> 00:48:27,006
[SPEAKER_07]: But this is still a very kind of interesting tale that's probably going to give people reservation about buying games secondhand.

584
00:48:27,678 --> 00:48:33,105
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Dr. Zia said, I've heard about folks being banned for using that device you were referring to.

585
00:48:33,905 --> 00:48:38,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Mish in chat says, I feel like at this point they're putting too many restrictions on the Switch 2 now.

586
00:48:38,811 --> 00:48:41,695
[SPEAKER_07]: Mind you, I don't condone pirating.

587
00:48:41,715 --> 00:48:44,018
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly, and there's the rub.

588
00:48:44,038 --> 00:48:50,125
[SPEAKER_07]: I may not support pirating, but somebody may be able to make a really convincing fake.

589
00:48:50,105 --> 00:48:55,714
[SPEAKER_07]: If they have the right color cartridge and a good enough printer to make a little sticker, what am I going to do?

590
00:48:56,154 --> 00:48:58,438
[SPEAKER_07]: Lick that cartridge to tell if it's authentic or not?

591
00:48:59,279 --> 00:49:00,681
[SPEAKER_03]: Were you just reading my mind?

592
00:49:00,701 --> 00:49:02,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I was saying you could lick it.

593
00:49:02,344 --> 00:49:10,716
[SPEAKER_07]: No, literally, if I were ever to be at a point in my life where I'm buying Switch games off Facebook Marketplace, I would insist on doing the lick test.

594
00:49:11,117 --> 00:49:12,719
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, but I'm going to need to lick this game.

595
00:49:12,739 --> 00:49:14,702
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but they could probably put that stuff on there.

596
00:49:14,763 --> 00:49:15,724
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just...

597
00:49:15,704 --> 00:49:17,246
[SPEAKER_06]: You can get that stuff.

598
00:49:17,386 --> 00:49:18,388
[SPEAKER_07]: But would they think to?

599
00:49:18,468 --> 00:49:20,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Would they think that the casual people would do it?

600
00:49:20,891 --> 00:49:24,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't put anything that you get from Facebook Marketplace in your mouth.

601
00:49:24,636 --> 00:49:25,297
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's true.

602
00:49:25,557 --> 00:49:27,660
[SPEAKER_07]: I might end up with more than a Switch game.

603
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:29,743
[SPEAKER_07]: I might end up with more than a Switch game.

604
00:49:30,143 --> 00:49:31,866
[SPEAKER_07]: I might end up with a staff infection.

605
00:49:31,886 --> 00:49:32,506
[SPEAKER_06]: I would not trust that.

606
00:49:32,527 --> 00:49:35,531
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, maybe silverware.

607
00:49:35,591 --> 00:49:36,932
[SPEAKER_06]: We run that through the dishwasher.

608
00:49:36,952 --> 00:49:38,134
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, I'm not like...

609
00:49:38,789 --> 00:49:40,656
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true.

610
00:49:41,278 --> 00:49:42,724
[SPEAKER_07]: Free antibiotics.

611
00:49:42,744 --> 00:49:43,587
[SPEAKER_03]: You have malaria.

612
00:49:45,012 --> 00:49:49,710
[SPEAKER_07]: How else am I supposed to know if the game is legit or not without trying to eat it?

613
00:49:51,513 --> 00:49:53,155
[SPEAKER_06]: And let's just put it this way.

614
00:49:53,215 --> 00:49:59,463
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like those old cartoons of Porky Pig or Bugs Bunny or whoever biting down on the nickel to see if it's real.

615
00:50:00,164 --> 00:50:05,971
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's not even Facebook Marketplace though, because the same thing could happen anywhere you buy used games with the Switch.

616
00:50:06,392 --> 00:50:16,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Granted, you know, like say if I purchase it from GameStop or something like that, there's a little bit of recourse because they can go back and see, oh, this person traded it in.

617
00:50:17,346 --> 00:50:21,351
[SPEAKER_06]: Although technically it's not stolen, so they can't really...

618
00:50:21,331 --> 00:50:23,715
[SPEAKER_06]: It wouldn't be a matter for the police.

619
00:50:23,755 --> 00:50:32,470
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that they keep the information about the person that trades stuff in because of different laws regarding stolen goods.

620
00:50:32,610 --> 00:50:42,286
[SPEAKER_06]: But in this case, if it's just that you traded in something that was banned, I don't know what they could really do there.

621
00:50:42,767 --> 00:50:43,508
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean...

622
00:50:44,197 --> 00:51:08,601
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know I don't know if they'd pursue it it's that whole thing so GameStop from what I understand will not take a game that is sealed they will not buy back a game that is sealed um because the chance is too high that it was stolen off a shelf but what ends up happening is that some people find it under the Christmas tree or whatever and they try to sell it back and because they're like I already have this game or whatever and then GameStop won't take it because

623
00:51:08,581 --> 00:51:10,523
[SPEAKER_06]: It's stupid anyways.

624
00:51:10,543 --> 00:51:17,891
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the whole problem was created by Nintendo in the first place to try to combat piracy, but really you're doing more harm to the consumer.

625
00:51:18,371 --> 00:51:32,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Once again, going back to the whole adage with DRM anyways, a lot of the times it's a legitimate consumer that gets punished more over this DRM than the actual people pirating those games.

626
00:51:32,726 --> 00:51:34,808
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the people pirating those games...

627
00:51:35,311 --> 00:51:57,623
[SPEAKER_06]: they're playing it on a modded Switch that's probably not connected to the internet so for them, they're not really going to run into any problems but the consumer that is using that card yeah, they will run into problems, which sucks it to me communicates that Nintendo is not doing this right but yeah

628
00:51:59,105 --> 00:52:00,567
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

629
00:52:00,907 --> 00:52:02,249
[SPEAKER_07]: Very interesting comments in chat.

630
00:52:02,349 --> 00:52:06,655
[SPEAKER_07]: S2100Matt says, I knew someone who bought a hearing aid off of a dead person.

631
00:52:06,715 --> 00:52:07,977
[SPEAKER_07]: The family sold it.

632
00:52:07,997 --> 00:52:11,562
[SPEAKER_07]: That's actually not that uncommon, though, because that's just medical equipment.

633
00:52:11,582 --> 00:52:21,956
[SPEAKER_07]: And when grandma or grandpa passes away, quite oftentimes there's an estate sale and wheelchair, hospital bed, all of that ends up being up for grabs and people need that stuff.

634
00:52:22,116 --> 00:52:26,682
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a weird-ass fucking reflection of the society we live in.

635
00:52:26,662 --> 00:52:31,168
[SPEAKER_07]: But yes, the hearing aid doesn't surprise me, honestly.

636
00:52:31,208 --> 00:52:33,652
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a charity group in Alabama.

637
00:52:33,732 --> 00:52:54,762
[SPEAKER_03]: It's how my mom got oxygen tanks and a walker when she had gotten out of the hospital that will take in donated, you know, whether they're from the deceased or old surplus or what have you, and then loan them out for free to people who need them indefinitely.

638
00:52:55,687 --> 00:53:23,365
[SPEAKER_07]: um interesting Ranmari says maybe they don't want the game because some cruel motherfucker gifted them a crazy bullet hell game well that's absurd bullet hell games are fun they're frustrating but you should at least try them anyway uh that's when you that's when you create the service we'll adopt your unloved bullet hell games for free you're just giving Ranmari Idea a sign for their next convention to walk around holding um

639
00:53:24,509 --> 00:53:31,878
[SPEAKER_07]: TheGorilla72 says, so why does GameStop sell me new games that are open then?

640
00:53:31,898 --> 00:53:33,499
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that still a thing that GameStop does?

641
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:35,221
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought they were told to knock that off.

642
00:53:36,723 --> 00:53:39,887
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, y'all, I have not bought a game in GameStop in so long.

643
00:53:40,307 --> 00:53:40,808
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

644
00:53:40,928 --> 00:53:42,390
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't tell you the last time I bought a game there.

645
00:53:42,610 --> 00:53:44,132
[SPEAKER_06]: They use it for displays.

646
00:53:44,432 --> 00:53:45,994
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, Gorilla says they sure do.

647
00:53:46,244 --> 00:53:51,815
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a display copy because manufacturers are being cheap.

648
00:53:52,236 --> 00:53:56,504
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't send display copies for these stores.

649
00:53:56,545 --> 00:54:04,320
[SPEAKER_06]: So they have one that's out there and then they keep everything behind the counter because they don't want live product out on the floor for a lot of that stuff.

650
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:14,293
[SPEAKER_06]: They should get the person that draws all the fake box art at GameStop to... Just don't buy games from GameStop.

651
00:54:14,393 --> 00:54:15,335
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

652
00:54:15,375 --> 00:54:17,798
[SPEAKER_06]: That just saves yourself.

653
00:54:18,439 --> 00:54:24,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, it really doesn't make sense to do it anymore unless it's ultra convenient for you.

654
00:54:24,627 --> 00:54:27,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Just go purchase it from anywhere else.

655
00:54:27,491 --> 00:54:30,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Purchase it off Amazon, purchase it from wherever.

656
00:54:30,935 --> 00:54:32,417
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just GameStop...

657
00:54:32,633 --> 00:54:40,022
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, even when you go in looking for things, it's just very not what it used to be, obviously.

658
00:54:40,042 --> 00:54:41,163
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I don't know.

659
00:54:41,183 --> 00:54:42,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't give them money.

660
00:54:42,325 --> 00:54:44,407
[SPEAKER_07]: It is weird to me, though, if that's the reason.

661
00:54:44,427 --> 00:54:46,550
[SPEAKER_07]: Because TigerClaw says, why not print the box art?

662
00:54:46,610 --> 00:54:47,671
[SPEAKER_07]: And I do have to go.

663
00:54:48,111 --> 00:54:48,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Copyright.

664
00:54:48,732 --> 00:54:50,494
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually is a legal thing.

665
00:54:50,514 --> 00:54:53,999
[SPEAKER_07]: But wouldn't the publisher send a PDF?

666
00:54:54,359 --> 00:54:57,302
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, they are trying to sell that publisher's game.

667
00:54:57,663 --> 00:54:57,763
Yeah.

668
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:17,743
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura,

669
00:55:18,179 --> 00:55:40,980
[SPEAKER_06]: dating everybody here so it's kind of like the blockbuster model where you have you know your thing on the shelf with the game and you go up to me like I would like this game and they have all the games behind the counter but there's one copy that they use to make that display copy that then doesn't have the card in it well right no no that's I don't think that that's

670
00:55:42,023 --> 00:55:44,066
[SPEAKER_03]: is that what they were talking about?

671
00:55:44,087 --> 00:55:46,050
[SPEAKER_03]: just having the one up there?

672
00:55:46,110 --> 00:56:01,416
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought they were talking about putting the copies out on the shelves the used ones we're crossing our wires we're talking about both at the same time this is basically where they're taking a new copy

673
00:56:01,936 --> 00:56:07,687
[SPEAKER_06]: Opening it up, taking the game out, putting it behind the counter, and then someone wants to go purchase whatever game it is.

674
00:56:07,728 --> 00:56:09,030
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like, oh, it's the last copy.

675
00:56:09,551 --> 00:56:10,072
[SPEAKER_06]: It's open.

676
00:56:10,112 --> 00:56:12,217
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to put the game back in there, and here you go.

677
00:56:12,237 --> 00:56:13,299
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the same price as new.

678
00:56:13,339 --> 00:56:14,140
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, well, hold on.

679
00:56:14,201 --> 00:56:15,744
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you opened that, though.

680
00:56:16,104 --> 00:56:17,708
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but it's new.

681
00:56:17,728 --> 00:56:19,030
[SPEAKER_06]: It's never played, but it's new.

682
00:56:19,471 --> 00:56:20,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but it's not sealed.

683
00:56:20,954 --> 00:56:22,677
[SPEAKER_06]: but you're trying to charge me the same price.

684
00:56:22,817 --> 00:56:24,801
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but it's new.

685
00:56:24,821 --> 00:56:26,483
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, they should just take the hit for it.

686
00:56:26,844 --> 00:56:29,368
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, because they're not selling used copies.

687
00:56:29,849 --> 00:56:31,632
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly, because, I mean, I'm sorry.

688
00:56:31,652 --> 00:56:32,473
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not my problem.

689
00:56:32,994 --> 00:56:36,080
[SPEAKER_06]: But they don't, and a lot of people just take it.

690
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:37,201
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like, whatever.

691
00:56:37,582 --> 00:56:38,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Tiger Claw.

692
00:56:38,323 --> 00:56:41,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, like, SSG100 Matt says it's like selling the 4 model.

693
00:56:41,489 --> 00:56:42,110
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

694
00:56:42,130 --> 00:56:42,270
Mm-hmm.

695
00:56:42,352 --> 00:56:50,402
[SPEAKER_07]: TigerClaw in chat says, I remember way back in the days at Toys R Us, they had something that looked like the box art and what was on the back of it so you can see what the game looks like.

696
00:56:50,722 --> 00:56:53,666
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you know in Japan they still use the slips?

697
00:56:53,686 --> 00:56:54,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Shane just told me that.

698
00:56:54,847 --> 00:56:56,950
[SPEAKER_07]: They still use the slips at Toys R Us in Japan.

699
00:56:57,651 --> 00:56:58,652
[SPEAKER_07]: What a time to be alive.

700
00:57:00,114 --> 00:57:02,597
[SPEAKER_03]: There's plenty of other places that do that too.

701
00:57:03,558 --> 00:57:04,579
[SPEAKER_03]: In Japan, that is.

702
00:57:04,610 --> 00:57:09,975
[SPEAKER_07]: TheGorilla72 says, I'm so old, I've been shopping at GameStop since they were Funkoland.

703
00:57:09,995 --> 00:57:13,719
[SPEAKER_07]: My friend, I remember when Funkoland only advertised in magazines.

704
00:57:15,221 --> 00:57:18,504
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember when you had to get the piece of paper to find out what the price of the game was.

705
00:57:19,845 --> 00:57:21,206
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's GameStop.

706
00:57:21,226 --> 00:57:28,233
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, you know that Dan managed GameStops for a long time, but he started with Funkoland.

707
00:57:28,534 --> 00:57:29,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.

708
00:57:29,990 --> 00:57:31,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, they're fine.

709
00:57:31,892 --> 00:57:36,337
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like, I don't know, like, I find myself wanting to go into them less and less.

710
00:57:36,357 --> 00:57:41,403
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, every time I go in there to look at stuff, it's just like, eh.

711
00:57:41,423 --> 00:57:43,525
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, there's no selection of anything.

712
00:57:44,126 --> 00:57:46,028
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just garbage I don't want.

713
00:57:46,348 --> 00:57:47,489
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's no deals.

714
00:57:47,990 --> 00:57:51,914
[SPEAKER_07]: What was that Garfield shirt I saw the last time I was in a game shop?

715
00:57:52,455 --> 00:57:53,035
[SPEAKER_07]: A game shop?

716
00:57:53,115 --> 00:57:53,816
[SPEAKER_07]: A game stop.

717
00:57:53,836 --> 00:57:55,979
[SPEAKER_07]: I was cracking up so fucking bad.

718
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:57,280
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

719
00:57:58,002 --> 00:57:59,143
[SPEAKER_07]: God, now I gotta find it.

720
00:57:59,364 --> 00:58:01,807
[SPEAKER_07]: I was so bored, I went to GameStop.

721
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:04,370
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll find it.

722
00:58:05,412 --> 00:58:08,496
[SPEAKER_03]: I do like to look- I actually got my Kirby coin purse there.

723
00:58:09,497 --> 00:58:15,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, because they sell a lot of, like, crap now, but, you know, sometimes it's interesting crap.

724
00:58:15,485 --> 00:58:19,270
[SPEAKER_03]: They actually have, like, really good official merch, and they'll have them marked down.

725
00:58:19,490 --> 00:58:19,730
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

726
00:58:20,912 --> 00:58:22,474
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'm trying to see if I can find-

727
00:58:23,450 --> 00:58:27,815
[SPEAKER_03]: But when I lived in Alabama, we had EB and we had Babbage's.

728
00:58:28,736 --> 00:58:29,477
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I found it.

729
00:58:29,577 --> 00:58:30,057
[SPEAKER_07]: I found it.

730
00:58:30,077 --> 00:58:37,085
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a shirt with Garfield on it that said, Stay Chill, where Garfield's licking an ice cream cone.

731
00:58:37,506 --> 00:58:40,129
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, that's gamer merch?

732
00:58:40,789 --> 00:58:47,517
[SPEAKER_07]: This looks like what mom wears the oversized shirt to stay home with.

733
00:58:48,188 --> 00:58:50,292
[SPEAKER_07]: and sit on the couch all day.

734
00:58:50,312 --> 00:58:54,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they sell pop culture stuff now, and so there's a lot of that.

735
00:58:55,041 --> 00:58:59,730
[SPEAKER_06]: No, seriously, because I got, I think, an Office shirt for my wife from there.

736
00:59:00,090 --> 00:59:11,091
[SPEAKER_06]: They have lots of just... It's basically a Hot Topic merch now that they have in there because... I mean, to be honest, they're making...

737
00:59:11,712 --> 00:59:21,299
[SPEAKER_06]: No Margin on the games, and they have to make profit with higher margin stuff, like those Funko Pops and everything.

738
00:59:21,961 --> 00:59:25,671
[SPEAKER_07]: That said, though... Did somebody say Funko Pops at a GameStop?

739
00:59:27,068 --> 00:59:50,646
[SPEAKER_03]: I got pictures of those too I just don't I'll do a deal on them if you like buy like they'll let you do the buy one get one thing if it's like you know because they do that for the sale ones if you're buying a new one and you want to pick up a sale one at the free or half price they'll do that sometimes I will say though they did have a nice Sprigatito purse they had a nice Sprigatito purse I would have maybe bought that

740
00:59:50,626 --> 00:59:59,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Literally the last thing I bought at a GameStop was my little fuzzy Kirby coin purse and a squishy flying Kirby.

741
00:59:59,739 --> 01:00:01,161
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll put it on our Discord.

742
01:00:01,261 --> 01:00:02,803
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, enough GameStop talk.

743
01:00:02,843 --> 01:00:03,945
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's move on to our next story.

744
01:00:05,767 --> 01:00:09,212
[SPEAKER_03]: But I like squishy Kirbys.

745
01:00:09,232 --> 01:00:12,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Me too, but... Alright, well.

746
01:00:13,258 --> 01:00:13,518
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

747
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:19,907
[SPEAKER_03]: I know people who are into scary-ass freaky game subnautica.

748
01:00:20,292 --> 01:00:34,110
[SPEAKER_03]: and on July 2nd, Krafton had said they removed members of the Subnautica 2 leadership team after I think that there was a leak.

749
01:00:34,131 --> 01:00:40,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they did confirm that there was a leak and the game is kind of in a little bit of trouble.

750
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:44,224
[SPEAKER_03]: There's just a lot of drama around it.

751
01:00:44,947 --> 01:01:12,540
[SPEAKER_03]: But they got rid of the game director, Charlie Cleveland, the co-founder of Unknown Worlds, Max McGuire, and the studio CEO, Ted Gill And then they have since filed a lawsuit against the developer in South Korea for wrongful dismissal But they were canned because there was considered a lack of progress on the game and inadequate content

752
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:40,452
[SPEAKER_03]: and that they were not fulfilling their leadership duties and so the game is behind the schedule because of it but I don't know but the leak on here it's like a state of development where the development progress was and them disagreeing on the release schedules it's some pretty interesting stuff

753
01:01:41,174 --> 01:01:50,064
[SPEAKER_03]: and while I don't, you know this is actually posted on Reddit and I mean, I'll tell you what, I'll repost it in our chat right now.

754
01:01:50,224 --> 01:01:53,748
[SPEAKER_07]: That's always lovely to have your corporate drama playing out on Reddit.

755
01:01:53,908 --> 01:01:56,431
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a lovely thing for these companies to have.

756
01:01:57,993 --> 01:02:08,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but at the same time, I mean, it is an interesting look behind the curtain especially because I think that

757
01:02:10,064 --> 01:02:20,395
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

758
01:02:21,590 --> 01:02:48,981
[SPEAKER_03]: they're even talking about like all of the list of changes from the launch specifications from 2023 to 2025 they're saying that there's a quote exactly on here it says the game's content volume has been scaled down compared to the initial EA spec target making it necessary to release the feasibility of the planned launch reassess sorry the feasibility of the planned launch but very

759
01:02:50,378 --> 01:02:51,300
[SPEAKER_03]: Very curious.

760
01:02:53,625 --> 01:02:57,574
[SPEAKER_03]: And it even talks about parts of what happens in the game.

761
01:02:59,819 --> 01:03:02,806
[SPEAKER_03]: So, very interesting.

762
01:03:02,826 --> 01:03:04,409
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me go ahead and spoil the plot.

763
01:03:04,429 --> 01:03:05,091
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so annoyed.

764
01:03:05,271 --> 01:03:05,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

765
01:03:08,158 --> 01:03:09,180
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, what do you got for us?

766
01:03:10,544 --> 01:03:19,764
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Destiny 2 apparently is getting some blowback from their upcoming The Edge of Fate expansion.

767
01:03:21,247 --> 01:03:28,502
[SPEAKER_06]: They were giving free loot for players, and apparently every day you can log in and get loot and all that stuff from...

768
01:03:28,482 --> 01:03:35,254
[SPEAKER_06]: The Emissary Vendor, and eventually claim an infinite nonary engram.

769
01:03:35,274 --> 01:03:38,940
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, none of this makes any sense to me because I don't play any Destiny whatsoever.

770
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:45,131
[SPEAKER_07]: I played it a few times and I sort of remember that stuff, but I... Okay.

771
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:47,976
[SPEAKER_06]: But basically... Rare digital shit.

772
01:03:49,610 --> 01:04:12,377
[SPEAKER_06]: so apparently players had discovered a trick for farming them in mass and uh so because those nonary engrams or whatever drop cosmetics uh and Bungie basically said stop doing that uh so there's ways to essentially game the system to get all these unlimited cosmetics and you know

773
01:04:13,133 --> 01:04:20,040
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't want that because that cuts into their bread and butter of monetization of their free-to-play games.

774
01:04:20,180 --> 01:04:21,962
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.

775
01:04:22,202 --> 01:04:27,308
[SPEAKER_06]: And then also, because they did that, they shut down the whole thing.

776
01:04:28,189 --> 01:04:29,330
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is due to an issue.

777
01:04:29,370 --> 01:04:33,935
[SPEAKER_06]: We have disabled the daily bonus of Nonary Engram available at the Emissary.

778
01:04:34,355 --> 01:04:36,998
[SPEAKER_06]: We are investigating a fix for the players.

779
01:04:37,018 --> 01:04:40,321
[SPEAKER_06]: And then because of that, people are now mass-deleting characters.

780
01:04:40,822 --> 01:04:42,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically saying that we are...

781
01:04:42,968 --> 01:04:47,394
[SPEAKER_06]: We are tired of this nonsense.

782
01:04:47,414 --> 01:04:47,715
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

783
01:04:48,957 --> 01:04:50,920
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not gonna take it.

784
01:04:52,582 --> 01:04:55,026
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we're not gonna take it.

785
01:04:55,046 --> 01:04:58,751
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, they said basically kill my drive for Luta Palooza.

786
01:05:00,493 --> 01:05:05,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Looks like tonight I finally check out that Mecha Break game.

787
01:05:05,501 --> 01:05:06,702
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't give them any more attention.

788
01:05:07,303 --> 01:05:09,747
[SPEAKER_06]: We already saw enough trailers for that.

789
01:05:09,767 --> 01:05:10,087
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

790
01:05:10,368 --> 01:05:10,528
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

791
01:05:10,660 --> 01:05:37,107
[SPEAKER_07]: Sheld Need for Speed

792
01:05:37,087 --> 01:05:41,172
[SPEAKER_07]: and is quietly parking, is that a pun, the series.

793
01:05:41,192 --> 01:05:51,365
[SPEAKER_07]: Speed Hunters was a site, by the way, that was partially funded by EA, or I think maybe it was funded in full by EA, and last had an update in April and is apparently ceasing operations.

794
01:05:51,986 --> 01:05:52,687
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm.

795
01:05:52,707 --> 01:05:56,952
[SPEAKER_07]: No official statement yet from EA on the Need for Speed franchise, but...

796
01:05:56,932 --> 01:06:02,102
[SPEAKER_07]: The publisher did shut down online servers for Need for Speed Rivals on October 7th.

797
01:06:02,323 --> 01:06:03,525
[SPEAKER_07]: Or it will be shutting it down.

798
01:06:04,547 --> 01:06:08,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Criterion Games moved most of the employees to focus on the Battlefield franchise.

799
01:06:09,778 --> 01:06:18,636
[SPEAKER_07]: And Battlefield head Vince Zampella told Eurogamer that the Need for Speed team would be, quote, "...joining their colleagues working on Battlefield."

800
01:06:18,616 --> 01:06:24,247
[SPEAKER_07]: So if there is a need for speed going, we don't know who's working on it.

801
01:06:24,267 --> 01:06:29,257
[SPEAKER_07]: So signs are pointing to the fact that this franchise may be donezo, which is kind of sad.

802
01:06:29,337 --> 01:06:31,461
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it really still had its fans.

803
01:06:31,481 --> 01:06:39,557
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I know Forza Horizon is a thing that a lot of people are playing, but that doesn't mean it can't exist at the same time with Need for Speed and some of the other big racing franchises out there.

804
01:06:39,938 --> 01:06:41,080
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of sad.

805
01:06:41,819 --> 01:06:46,509
[SPEAKER_07]: Sj100Matt says, listen, I'm a petty bitch when it comes to Need for Speed.

806
01:06:46,529 --> 01:06:51,138
[SPEAKER_07]: I always disliked the EA made Criterion Games work on the franchise rather than Burnout.

807
01:06:51,158 --> 01:06:54,946
[SPEAKER_07]: The Burnout franchise died for Need for Speed to live and I'm bitter about it.

808
01:06:55,467 --> 01:06:56,609
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, valid.

809
01:06:56,629 --> 01:06:57,932
[SPEAKER_07]: I really like Burnout too.

810
01:06:58,654 --> 01:07:02,241
[SPEAKER_07]: So I understand that frustration to be quite honest.

811
01:07:04,364 --> 01:07:12,523
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, with all of these dying games, sometimes we need to go back and recognize a classic, something we want to go back and play.

812
01:07:12,883 --> 01:07:15,369
[SPEAKER_07]: Although, I don't know, it might be difficult to check out this one, but we'll see.

813
01:07:15,730 --> 01:07:20,601
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's roll the Classic Game of the Week bump and let Jamie do her thing.

814
01:07:31,010 --> 01:07:38,870
[SPEAKER_00]: and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

815
01:07:38,890 --> 01:07:42,520
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for the classic game of the week.

816
01:07:42,540 --> 01:07:45,407
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, DarkSakura, what did you pick for us this week?

817
01:07:46,383 --> 01:08:06,265
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell or Jigoku

818
01:08:06,245 --> 01:08:09,930
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to reach Buddha to have your fate decided.

819
01:08:10,110 --> 01:08:15,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Tarosuke has key bullets that he can fire at enemies and charge to increase his power.

820
01:08:15,958 --> 01:08:19,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Enemies can drop money and you can buy weapons and other stuff.

821
01:08:20,043 --> 01:08:21,164
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are two versions.

822
01:08:21,765 --> 01:08:25,570
[SPEAKER_03]: This is actually of the arcade release.

823
01:08:25,550 --> 01:08:49,127
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a Japanese version and an English version but that English version was only released in other Asian countries outside of Japan the arcade archives by the way have both versions of the game so Tarosuke was banished to Jigoku for causing mischief in the world of the living and so he has to go fight

824
01:08:49,107 --> 01:09:17,646
[SPEAKER_03]: the monsters in hell to reach Iyama who is the Buddhist deity that judges the dead to determine his fate and you have five different levels each taking place in different parts of Jigoku so there is Jigoku Iriguchi which is the gate to hell, Yukai the ghost sea, other levels like that and so the first four stages have a boss fight with an Oni

825
01:09:17,626 --> 01:09:35,922
[SPEAKER_03]: and then at the beginning of these Tarosuke has to kneel in a shrine and summon a spirit named Monmotaro to defeat the oni and you play as Monmotaro not Momotaro but Monmotaro and you can fly around and shoot pellets kind of you know

826
01:09:36,391 --> 01:09:43,400
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it gets harder as you go along and you have to find different secret items to unlock the way out.

827
01:09:44,261 --> 01:09:45,722
[SPEAKER_03]: All kinds of stuff.

828
01:09:45,802 --> 01:09:57,457
[SPEAKER_03]: And on top of that, the Famicom version has a pious meter that's filled when Tarosuke does good deeds, such as completing his objectives in the levels.

829
01:09:57,477 --> 01:10:00,981
[SPEAKER_03]: And the pious meter also determines which of the endings that you get.

830
01:10:00,961 --> 01:10:06,674
[SPEAKER_03]: So given that I did speak about a Famicom version, there are other releases.

831
01:10:06,694 --> 01:10:12,347
[SPEAKER_03]: It was ported to the PC Engine and Famicom with some changes, of course.

832
01:10:12,889 --> 01:10:19,965
[SPEAKER_03]: The PC Engine version and the arcade version were both re-released for the Japanese Virtual Console.

833
01:10:19,945 --> 01:10:30,224
[SPEAKER_03]: and a Japan-only spin-off called Kyukai Dolchiki, which is a baseball version of the game.

834
01:10:30,724 --> 01:10:33,009
[SPEAKER_03]: A yakyu, as it is.

835
01:10:33,169 --> 01:10:38,258
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's very similar to Namco's World Stadium series.

836
01:10:38,238 --> 01:10:55,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Tarosuke also appeared in Namco X Capcom on PS2 and he teamed up with Taira no Kagekiyo from Genpei Tomaden and he also has a cameo appearance in Project X Zone 2 for the 3DS.

837
01:10:56,799 --> 01:11:07,131
[SPEAKER_03]: At any rate, Game Machine publication said that Yokai Dolchiki was the most popular arcade game in the month of April 1987 and went on to be

838
01:11:07,111 --> 01:11:13,359
[SPEAKER_03]: The fifth highest grossing table arcade game in 1987 in Japan.

839
01:11:13,379 --> 01:11:15,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, Gamest gave it some awards.

840
01:11:15,201 --> 01:11:19,426
[SPEAKER_03]: It won the 8th Grand Prize and 4th Best Ending Award and 8th Best Graphics.

841
01:11:19,927 --> 01:11:22,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Famitsu gave it the Silver Hall of Fame.

842
01:11:22,630 --> 01:11:23,932
[SPEAKER_03]: That's for the Famicom version.

843
01:11:25,194 --> 01:11:25,834
[SPEAKER_03]: But there you go.

844
01:11:26,615 --> 01:11:30,460
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a neat, fun little game.

845
01:11:31,662 --> 01:11:33,604
[SPEAKER_03]: I know not a lot of people have heard of it.

846
01:11:34,405 --> 01:11:36,848
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's worth checking out.

847
01:11:36,946 --> 01:11:41,131
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, this I, you know, again, I'm sorry, the podcast listeners can't see the visuals here.

848
01:11:41,151 --> 01:11:49,620
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, this is, this is a pretty neat looking game for the era, especially kind of the aesthetic with the gigantic mini map in the corner.

849
01:11:50,101 --> 01:11:55,707
[SPEAKER_07]: And just like one small, like, really, it's just like the bottom half of the screen is the actual game.

850
01:11:56,048 --> 01:11:59,071
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know why it gives me kind of Rygar vibes with the setup like that.

851
01:11:59,131 --> 01:12:00,793
[SPEAKER_07]: Because like Rygar, Rygar...

852
01:12:00,773 --> 01:12:05,420
[SPEAKER_07]: The game kind of takes place in a strip through the middle and the rest is all like UI.

853
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:10,928
[SPEAKER_07]: But I did not know much about this game, but I'm kind of intrigued, I got to admit.

854
01:12:11,849 --> 01:12:19,240
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also that era of Namco artwork that I think led to the Cosmo Gang style is what I like to call it.

855
01:12:19,340 --> 01:12:20,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

856
01:12:20,662 --> 01:12:26,410
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the Cosmo Gang and the Point Blank style is that same art style.

857
01:12:26,693 --> 01:12:52,448
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, we did get, you know, Makaimura and

858
01:12:52,715 --> 01:12:57,240
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, now that guy's praying in front of a statue and was breathing fire.

859
01:12:57,260 --> 01:12:58,081
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty wild.

860
01:12:58,141 --> 01:13:01,946
[SPEAKER_03]: This is where you have Mon Motaro to play for you.

861
01:13:02,166 --> 01:13:02,466
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh.

862
01:13:02,827 --> 01:13:04,008
[SPEAKER_07]: This is really cool, though.

863
01:13:04,088 --> 01:13:06,691
[SPEAKER_07]: As far as a piece of gaming's history, I bet not a lot of people heard of this.

864
01:13:07,012 --> 01:13:09,354
[SPEAKER_07]: So you said this is on a PS2 anthology.

865
01:13:09,394 --> 01:13:15,341
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it on any of the NAMCO discs from back in the day?

866
01:13:15,361 --> 01:13:20,427
[SPEAKER_03]: The PS2 is that Tarosuke has an appearance

867
01:13:20,407 --> 01:13:22,369
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, oh, my bad, my bad.

868
01:13:23,190 --> 01:13:28,796
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a character in Namco X Capcom and he's in Cameo and Project X Zone 2.

869
01:13:28,816 --> 01:13:30,438
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, okay, that's right.

870
01:13:30,839 --> 01:13:33,702
[SPEAKER_03]: It was in the Arcade Archives and Virtual Console.

871
01:13:34,142 --> 01:13:35,704
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Arcade Archives, okay.

872
01:13:36,805 --> 01:13:38,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly, exactly.

873
01:13:38,227 --> 01:13:41,150
[SPEAKER_03]: So, which of course is available for PS4 and up.

874
01:13:41,170 --> 01:13:43,253
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah, no, Arcade Archives is great.

875
01:13:43,393 --> 01:13:45,095
[SPEAKER_07]: So, okay, that's a way you could play this then.

876
01:13:45,115 --> 01:13:46,376
[SPEAKER_07]: I might have to check that out.

877
01:13:46,396 --> 01:13:46,656
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

878
01:13:46,676 --> 01:13:47,037
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

879
01:13:47,738 --> 01:13:47,818
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

880
01:13:47,838 --> 01:13:48,218
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

881
01:13:48,238 --> 01:13:49,840
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it's...

882
01:13:50,090 --> 01:13:53,600
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a fun little one.

883
01:13:53,700 --> 01:13:55,405
[SPEAKER_03]: I've played a little bit of it.

884
01:13:57,110 --> 01:14:02,867
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just one of those games that I pick up and play for a little bit, and then I'm like, okay, I played it, and I don't think about it for another year.

885
01:14:03,151 --> 01:14:04,052
[SPEAKER_07]: No, cool pick, though.

886
01:14:04,192 --> 01:14:04,573
[SPEAKER_07]: I like that.

887
01:14:04,613 --> 01:14:06,436
[SPEAKER_07]: I might actually check that out on Arcade Archives.

888
01:14:06,456 --> 01:14:08,058
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you.

889
01:14:08,078 --> 01:14:08,398
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

890
01:14:08,518 --> 01:14:11,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, at this point, though, I must apologize.

891
01:14:11,803 --> 01:14:16,510
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to bid everybody adieu because my migraine is now at that point.

892
01:14:16,710 --> 01:14:17,110
[SPEAKER_07]: I got you.

893
01:14:17,130 --> 01:14:19,374
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry to hear that, but I do hope you feel better.

894
01:14:20,075 --> 01:14:23,880
[SPEAKER_07]: And do you have any parting words or final thoughts for our listeners tonight before we let you go?

895
01:14:25,883 --> 01:14:29,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Killers be stinky in DVD, and I'm a stinky killer.

896
01:14:29,341 --> 01:14:48,379
[SPEAKER_07]: I still have not played this anniversary event I haven't I don't even think the game's installed oh no I lost access to it on PS5 I still have the Steam version though but yeah well then Rob play with me on Tuesday um maybe I gotta see what my schedule is this week but maybe I got a lot of stuff going on in my day job this week but maybe late at night

897
01:14:48,562 --> 01:14:49,844
[SPEAKER_03]: One last little thing.

898
01:14:50,124 --> 01:14:59,555
[SPEAKER_03]: We did Swan Lake yesterday, and I felt like I was a den mother hanging out backstage because I was only in two minutes of the dance because I had been injured when we started rehearsals.

899
01:15:01,517 --> 01:15:12,190
[SPEAKER_03]: But for every dancer out there, for everyone who does any kind of sport, make sure there is somebody with an equipped first aid kit and bring scissors.

900
01:15:13,182 --> 01:15:14,644
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

901
01:15:14,684 --> 01:15:17,448
[SPEAKER_07]: We try to have that when performing the Rocky Horror Picture Show.

902
01:15:17,508 --> 01:15:20,512
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good idea for any situation with a lot of people.

903
01:15:20,593 --> 01:15:21,374
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a first aid kit.

904
01:15:21,394 --> 01:15:22,916
[SPEAKER_07]: But yes, yes.

905
01:15:22,936 --> 01:15:28,303
[SPEAKER_03]: And everyone owes it to themselves to at least be first aid certified at one point in their life.

906
01:15:29,746 --> 01:15:33,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you never know when that's going to save somebody's life or prevent a worse injury.

907
01:15:33,531 --> 01:15:35,133
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what I have to leave everyone with.

908
01:15:35,153 --> 01:15:37,416
[SPEAKER_07]: The beat to CPR is staying alive.

909
01:15:37,797 --> 01:15:40,641
[SPEAKER_07]: Do do do do do do do do do do do.

910
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:45,835
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of other songs, but Stayin' Alive is the one that I remember because literally that's what you're doing.

911
01:15:45,895 --> 01:15:47,861
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what you're doing with CPR, so it's easier to remember.

912
01:15:49,506 --> 01:15:50,048
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

913
01:15:50,228 --> 01:15:50,971
[SPEAKER_07]: Feel better, DarkSakura.

914
01:15:50,991 --> 01:15:51,412
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a good night.

915
01:15:52,556 --> 01:15:52,876
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

916
01:15:52,897 --> 01:15:53,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

917
01:15:53,463 --> 01:15:59,289
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, I knew other people would start saying other games and all that stuff.

918
01:15:59,670 --> 01:16:03,154
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's go over to Loki.

919
01:16:03,414 --> 01:16:05,697
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a question in chat, actually.

920
01:16:05,757 --> 01:16:09,841
[SPEAKER_07]: Chat wants to know, what is the game that is playing behind you tonight on stream?

921
01:16:09,861 --> 01:16:16,969
[SPEAKER_07]: Because usually, as we're taping live at VOG Network, you have a game that plays behind you, which this looks like some type of Zelda clone.

922
01:16:16,989 --> 01:16:19,172
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that that Dungeon Maker game?

923
01:16:19,192 --> 01:16:19,572
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't...

924
01:16:19,552 --> 01:16:46,015
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't think it was Legally distinct, excuse me, legally distinct Sure

925
01:16:46,214 --> 01:17:13,960
[SPEAKER_06]: hmm so yes it's just was this something they ran in the middle of the night at Summer Games Done Quick or something is that why it's in the bundle oh wow must have it must have been one of the games I haven't gotten a chance to check it out but yeah it certainly it looks like a link to the past for sure I didn't realize Humble Bundle was running a thing right now for Summer Games Done Quick um is it over at this point maybe no it's still going for another four days

926
01:17:14,007 --> 01:17:14,515
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, nice.

927
01:17:15,653 --> 01:17:16,710
[SPEAKER_07]: I gotta try to find it.

928
01:17:18,412 --> 01:17:47,136
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm actually looking at their site right now to try to see what this is all about because I feel like oh there it is I feel like you know Humble Bundle just kind of turned into any other store at some point but I guess we can point out here real quick let's see they have okay leave me alone I hate these pop-ups they have yeah Collateral Damage that's a fun game oh Roller Coaster there's that Lena's Inception that you're talking about okay so they have like nine indie games for that that's kind of cute

929
01:17:48,162 --> 01:17:55,052
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because Lenda's Inception itself is $10, and the bundle is basically $10 or more, so it makes sense.

930
01:17:55,293 --> 01:17:55,593
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

931
01:17:56,795 --> 01:17:59,459
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's move on.

932
01:17:59,539 --> 01:18:03,805
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get to some rapid-fire news and talk about some other things that are going on in the industry.

933
01:18:03,825 --> 01:18:05,007
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Loki, we'll go to you.

934
01:18:05,864 --> 01:18:18,137
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess this is silly, but GameStop is auctioning off for charity the stapler that ruined Nintendo Switch 2s in Staten Island.

935
01:18:18,257 --> 01:18:19,738
[SPEAKER_07]: This is so weird.

936
01:18:19,758 --> 01:18:24,463
[SPEAKER_07]: How desperate are they for money?

937
01:18:24,483 --> 01:18:25,885
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not even desperate for money.

938
01:18:25,925 --> 01:18:30,910
[SPEAKER_06]: It's desperate for attention because they're doing it for charity.

939
01:18:31,227 --> 01:18:33,579
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's for charity?

940
01:18:33,719 --> 01:18:34,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, then I'll let it go.

941
01:18:35,006 --> 01:18:37,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's for the Children's Miracle Network Hospitals.

942
01:18:37,860 --> 01:18:38,262
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

943
01:18:38,422 --> 01:18:39,769
[SPEAKER_06]: But, I mean...

944
01:18:41,707 --> 01:18:50,316
[SPEAKER_06]: If you really want to poo poo on their goodwill, which I'm always willing to do, it's a tax write off for them as well.

945
01:18:51,978 --> 01:18:56,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you like to round up your purchase today to save sick kids?

946
01:18:56,864 --> 01:18:59,687
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you like to round up your purchase today to feed hungry kids?

947
01:19:00,027 --> 01:19:03,811
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I would prefer billionaires feed them as opposed to you getting a tax write off.

948
01:19:03,871 --> 01:19:04,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

949
01:19:04,910 --> 01:19:10,962
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so as much as I like the idea of them raising money for taxes, this is just a big ol' attention thing.

950
01:19:11,543 --> 01:19:12,365
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I don't know.

951
01:19:12,846 --> 01:19:15,752
[SPEAKER_06]: I just... I don't know.

952
01:19:16,353 --> 01:19:22,084
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't... I'd be surprised if this company lasts till 2030, let's be honest.

953
01:19:22,465 --> 01:19:22,846
[SPEAKER_06]: Fair enough.

954
01:19:23,367 --> 01:19:24,589
[SPEAKER_06]: What else do we have, Loki?

955
01:19:25,312 --> 01:19:32,622
[SPEAKER_06]: We also have Cyberpunk 2077 headed to July's PlayStation Plus for PlayStation 5.

956
01:19:33,043 --> 01:19:34,184
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's pretty awesome.

957
01:19:34,905 --> 01:19:37,068
[SPEAKER_06]: PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium.

958
01:19:37,489 --> 01:19:52,790
[SPEAKER_06]: You get Cyberpunk 2077, Abiotic Factor, Banishers, Ghosts of New Eden, Bluey the video game, Planet Zoo, Risk of Rain 2, Tropico 6, and New World... I don't know.

959
01:19:52,910 --> 01:19:53,511
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a made-up name.

960
01:19:53,651 --> 01:19:54,212
[SPEAKER_06]: ATRM?

961
01:19:54,692 --> 01:19:55,133
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

962
01:19:55,653 --> 01:20:03,150
[SPEAKER_06]: PlayStation Plus Premium is also getting some older games, Twisted Metal 3 and 4 as well.

963
01:20:03,170 --> 01:20:04,195
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool!

964
01:20:06,031 --> 01:20:06,672
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

965
01:20:06,952 --> 01:20:09,215
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let's talk about Summer Games Done Quick.

966
01:20:09,235 --> 01:20:17,445
[SPEAKER_07]: We were mentioning it earlier in the show, but we wanted to share with you the official total that was raised, which is $2,436,614.

967
01:20:17,805 --> 01:20:23,792
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was all raised, of course, for Doctors Without Borders.

968
01:20:24,533 --> 01:20:29,138
[SPEAKER_07]: It was pointed out that that was a little bit under what was raised in 2025.

969
01:20:29,179 --> 01:20:32,983
[SPEAKER_07]: That was $2.5 million that was raised in 2025.

970
01:20:32,963 --> 01:20:43,287
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, there's a million factors that could go into that, and certainly raising $2.4-plus million for an awesome charity, I don't think there's any way you can frame that as a bad thing.

971
01:20:43,848 --> 01:20:48,559
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there's just a lot of other things vying for attention now.

972
01:20:48,539 --> 01:20:56,272
[SPEAKER_07]: Summer Games and Awesome Games Done Quick did their best years when everybody was stuck at home during COVID and couldn't go out and do other things.

973
01:20:56,292 --> 01:20:59,857
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would say probably things that impact the weather.

974
01:21:00,559 --> 01:21:06,328
[SPEAKER_07]: If the weather is pretty nice out, people are probably going to be less inclined to stay at home and watch Games Done Quick.

975
01:21:06,308 --> 01:21:09,415
[SPEAKER_07]: It just depends what else is going on.

976
01:21:10,076 --> 01:21:12,622
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's other competition in the charity space as well.

977
01:21:13,003 --> 01:21:15,408
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of people raising money for various charities.

978
01:21:15,428 --> 01:21:21,482
[SPEAKER_07]: But I still think it's really rad that Games Done Quick, all of these years later, because it's been going on for a while, can still raise...

979
01:21:21,462 --> 01:21:25,726
[SPEAKER_07]: Well over $2 million for the charity, which is great.

980
01:21:26,987 --> 01:21:32,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you know $50 million all time over that raised in the history of all the Games Done Quick marathon events?

981
01:21:33,152 --> 01:21:34,693
[SPEAKER_07]: So pretty cool.

982
01:21:35,454 --> 01:21:40,578
[SPEAKER_07]: Direct donations, but also partner donations, fan gammer.

983
01:21:40,638 --> 01:21:42,960
[SPEAKER_07]: Did I really just almost read fan gamer as fan gammer?

984
01:21:43,601 --> 01:21:44,702
[SPEAKER_07]: Y'all, I'm getting old.

985
01:21:45,462 --> 01:21:49,346
[SPEAKER_07]: The Yeti, fan gammer, where every gammer has a voice.

986
01:21:49,566 --> 01:21:51,047
[SPEAKER_07]: And the Humble Bundle.

987
01:21:51,483 --> 01:21:52,725
[SPEAKER_07]: were all part of that.

988
01:21:52,746 --> 01:21:57,655
[SPEAKER_07]: So that also explains their tie-in there was that they were a partner with Summer Games Done Quick.

989
01:21:57,675 --> 01:22:07,195
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, Summer Games Done Quick had runs like Super Mario Maker 2, Mario Kart World, Deltarune, some of the newer games that were included towards the end there.

990
01:22:08,257 --> 01:22:08,918
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah,

991
01:22:08,898 --> 01:22:12,121
[SPEAKER_07]: There's other speedruns that Games Done Quick does.

992
01:22:12,522 --> 01:22:22,271
[SPEAKER_07]: We know the big ones, but do you know that Flame Fatales 2025 called Survive Her this year is running from September 7th through 14th.

993
01:22:22,352 --> 01:22:26,015
[SPEAKER_07]: The schedule is available for that over at gamesdonequick.com.

994
01:22:26,716 --> 01:22:29,479
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's other things to look forward to throughout the year.

995
01:22:29,999 --> 01:22:38,668
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome Games Done Quick 2026 will be held January 4th through 10th in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

996
01:22:39,340 --> 01:22:44,148
[SPEAKER_07]: One other quick thing to share here, which is really sad news, unfortunately.

997
01:22:44,349 --> 01:22:49,337
[SPEAKER_07]: At the age of 71, we have lost James Carter Cathcart.

998
01:22:49,397 --> 01:22:53,304
[SPEAKER_07]: James Carter Cathcart was the voice of James in Pokemon.

999
01:22:53,765 --> 01:22:54,225
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty big.

1000
01:22:54,346 --> 01:22:56,910
[SPEAKER_07]: Also Meowth Professor Oak.

1001
01:22:56,890 --> 01:22:57,911
[SPEAKER_07]: and much more.

1002
01:22:57,951 --> 01:23:01,075
[SPEAKER_07]: But of course, some of those Pokemon characters are pretty legendary.

1003
01:23:01,996 --> 01:23:05,080
[SPEAKER_07]: Fergus was also one of the roles in Pokemon, the first movie.

1004
01:23:06,061 --> 01:23:10,586
[SPEAKER_07]: Snubbull in Pikachu's Vacation, which was the short that accompanied the original movie.

1005
01:23:11,227 --> 01:23:14,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, he was Weevil Underwood in Yu-Gi-Oh!

1006
01:23:14,811 --> 01:23:15,632

1007
01:23:16,073 --> 01:23:24,062

01:28:38,849 --> 01:29:05,578
[SPEAKER_07]: So Ranma's telling us in chat that the X or cross is silent in Hunter, and I'm bitching about it's never consistent, because you have a title like Namco Cross Capcom, or then you have one where it's like, or Final Fantasy X, or it's the X means, or Final Fantasy X-2 specifically, not X-2, or you have something where it's, I'm trying to think of one where you actually do say X, Mortal Kombat X, like it's never fucking consistent, the usage of the X. I'm just gonna emphasize it even harder now.

1038
01:29:05,558 --> 01:29:06,379
[SPEAKER_06]: is what I'm going to do.

1045
01:29:22,065 --> 01:29:23,968
[SPEAKER_06]: It said, who's at the door?

1046
01:29:24,088 --> 01:29:27,413
[SPEAKER_06]: I read that as who ate the door, which I was like, that's silly.

01:29:37,929 --> 01:29:44,297
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we're almost towards the part of the show where we'll take your calls over on our Discord server, but you should join our Discord server anyway.

1053
01:29:44,317 --> 01:29:47,001
[SPEAKER_07]: You all have lovely conversations throughout the week.

1054
01:29:47,081 --> 01:29:55,853
[SPEAKER_07]: That's over at vognetwork.com slash Discord, vognetwork.com slash Discord, and we will look to the green room to see if anybody wants to give us a chat later on.

1055
01:29:55,913 --> 01:30:01,080
[SPEAKER_07]: But we do have one more story for you here, a very topical story from Loki.

1056
01:30:02,258 --> 01:30:12,573
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, and so, you know, Itch.io will do these different bundles for different charities and different things, usually stuff that's going on in the world.

1057
01:30:13,174 --> 01:30:20,344
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, they did the bundle for racial justice, bundle for Ukraine, the California wildfires.

1058
01:30:20,465 --> 01:30:25,292
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, now we have the No Ice in California Itch charity bundle.

1059
01:30:25,893 --> 01:30:28,236
[SPEAKER_06]: 500 games for a $10 donation.

1060
01:30:29,057 --> 01:30:31,000
[SPEAKER_06]: That is...

1061
01:30:31,655 --> 01:30:38,423
[SPEAKER_06]: basically going towards funding those, I guess, LA immigrants who are facing ICE invasions.

1062
01:30:40,245 --> 01:30:40,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Topical.

1063
01:30:41,567 --> 01:30:42,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Is Pixel Poops in it?

1064
01:30:43,509 --> 01:30:45,172
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you were in one of these.

1065
01:30:45,512 --> 01:30:49,877
[SPEAKER_06]: It was before in one of the other ones, but that's back when it cost something.

1066
01:30:49,957 --> 01:30:52,400
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember, as a reminder, it is free forever now.

1067
01:30:52,420 --> 01:30:53,041
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's right.

1068
01:30:53,061 --> 01:30:53,341
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

1069
01:30:53,361 --> 01:30:54,583
[SPEAKER_07]: You made it free forever anyway.

1070
01:30:54,663 --> 01:30:56,025
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, nice.

1071
01:30:56,425 --> 01:30:58,708
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, yeah, you could put it in the bundle, but...

1072
01:30:58,688 --> 01:31:00,871
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it doesn't matter because it's free anyway, yeah.

1073
01:31:01,051 --> 01:31:01,411
[SPEAKER_07]: Got it.

1074
01:31:01,872 --> 01:31:03,153
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no, I think that's a great deal.

1075
01:31:03,173 --> 01:31:04,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of it's tabletop games, though.

1076
01:31:04,635 --> 01:31:10,802
[SPEAKER_06]: They said 560 games that are in there, 427 of them are tabletop RPGs.

1077
01:31:10,942 --> 01:31:12,404
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a lot of RPG.

1078
01:31:12,464 --> 01:31:19,512
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there's a lot of tabletop players out there, too, that, you know, might enjoy a little bit of diversity in their Friday night game club or whatever.

1079
01:31:19,532 --> 01:31:24,438
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the games when they're talking about, like, which ones you should check out of the bundle.

1080
01:31:24,578 --> 01:31:26,841
[SPEAKER_06]: One of them is Wrap Your Boyfriend, a high school romance.

1081
01:31:27,161 --> 01:31:27,261
Yeah.

1082
01:31:27,663 --> 01:31:29,526
[SPEAKER_06]: It is exactly what you think it is.

1083
01:31:29,546 --> 01:31:36,215
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well, definitely a worthy cause as far as I'm concerned.

1084
01:31:37,137 --> 01:31:37,717
[SPEAKER_07]: Clever boy.

1085
01:31:38,959 --> 01:31:41,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, hope you'll check that out over on itch.io.

1086
01:31:42,745 --> 01:31:52,358
[SPEAKER_07]: With that, we are towards the end of the show, but we want to open it up to any questions you might have for us in chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

1087
01:31:52,739 --> 01:31:53,620
[SPEAKER_07]: And I forgot...

1088
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:57,470
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie is not here to do the mailbag so I'm going to try to bring that up real quick.

1089
01:31:58,233 --> 01:32:01,461
[SPEAKER_07]: In the meantime, Loki, do you have any last minute stories for us tonight?

1090
01:32:02,865 --> 01:32:05,432
[SPEAKER_06]: I do not, actually.

1091
01:32:05,817 --> 01:32:08,060
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, there's no last minute stories.

1092
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:09,882
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, I feel like we don't have anything to talk about.

1093
01:32:09,962 --> 01:32:15,049
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I said at the top of the show, it wasn't exactly a busy, busy week, all things considered.

1094
01:32:15,069 --> 01:32:20,817
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I do want to thank, so we didn't officially get like any emails to read tonight.

1095
01:32:21,157 --> 01:32:28,026
[SPEAKER_07]: But I do want to thank, we got an email from E3VL who actually sent a code for me for the Pokemon trading card game.

1096
01:32:28,326 --> 01:32:31,150
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to be honest, I kind of fell off the wagon with that.

1097
01:32:31,130 --> 01:32:34,198
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'll still redeem the codes because you never know when I might get back on that wagon.

1098
01:32:34,218 --> 01:32:35,903
[SPEAKER_07]: So I do appreciate you sending that along.

1099
01:32:35,923 --> 01:32:39,353
[SPEAKER_07]: But I did kind of fall off the trading card game bandwagon at some point.

1100
01:32:39,894 --> 01:32:40,235
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1101
01:32:41,218 --> 01:32:44,607
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if I was just getting annoyed I kept getting so many repeats or what it was.

1102
01:32:44,627 --> 01:32:46,793
[SPEAKER_07]: I just found another game to...

1103
01:32:46,773 --> 01:32:47,614
[SPEAKER_07]: Break the cycle.

1104
01:32:47,634 --> 01:32:48,215
[SPEAKER_07]: Who knows?

1105
01:32:48,235 --> 01:32:48,976
[SPEAKER_07]: Who knows?

1106
01:32:48,996 --> 01:32:55,426
[SPEAKER_07]: So, well, if you want to send us an email for a future week, participate at orangelaundradio.com is the place to do that.

1107
01:32:55,767 --> 01:32:58,972
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess otherwise, we'll wrap things up for tonight.

1108
01:32:59,332 --> 01:33:02,277
[SPEAKER_07]: So I want to thank you all, of course, for listening to Orange Lawns Radio.

[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, your final thought.

1125
01:34:22,464 --> 01:34:26,642
[SPEAKER_06]: My final thought is that I'm going to be busy this week.

1126

[SPEAKER_07]: I have a lot of stuff to do.

01:34:33,272 --> 01:34:37,576
[SPEAKER_07]: My final thought is Fantasy Life 1.

1131
01:34:37,596 --> 01:34:42,740
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got to keep, or I, whatever they call it, Fantasy Life, the girl that steals time.

1132
01:34:43,501 --> 01:34:47,905
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to just focus and stop getting distracted by min-maxing everything.

1133
01:34:48,005 --> 01:34:49,907
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's so hard in that game.

1134
01:34:49,947 --> 01:34:51,488

1135
