8283	8435	Thanks for watching!
9532	12035	Quote, an advocacy group made up of AAA publishers.
12235	15159	In addition, many titles are designed from the ground up to be online only.
15199	19864	These proposals would curtail developer choice by making these video games prohibitively expensive to create.
19964	27573	I'm pretty sure games have only gotten more expensive since the era of GameSpy, and taking on 100% of the server costs makes it cost more than the alternative, not less.
27874	30116	This intro has not been brought to you by a Mind's Eye Saboteur.
30316	35322	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this initiative and the rest of the week's gaming news.
35342	38526	Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
38506	41170	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
41210	45355	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
45475	56150	It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live once again tonight with episode number 1053 for tonight, July the 6th of 2025.
57452	59474	Can't believe we're already in July.
59935	65863	I think as I saw in a post the other day that was very hateful, we are now closer to 2050.
65843	89539	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
91088	113637	I think okay I guess so yeah cool I mean I'm hoping I can go kind of we sort of blip didn't blip it on the radar I think so right now it is what it is yeah I gotcha I gotcha uh all right well we'll go say hello uh next off to the one and only Techmaster Loki hello hi Loki how are you
114562	116145	I don't know, apparently I have a splinter in my finger.
116385	117587	I don't even know where it came from.
118810	121114	I've touched no wood at all.
122156	127946	The closest thing to wood was I picked up my... Can't say the same, but I'm bummed.
128187	128647	Just kidding.
130050	130371	Anyway.
130851	133937	Well, that better not be splintering.
135385	139735	I'm playing Fantasy Life and I'm working on crafting.
139755	141580	What on earth are you talking about, Loki?
141921	143805	I was referring to my playthrough of Fantasy Life.
143925	144848	I don't know what you're talking about.
145770	149138	Anyway, well, I hope I'm sorry to hear you got a splinter.
150120	151062	Just blame it on the cat.
151082	152145	When in doubt, blame it on the cat.
152325	153428	Did you get it out?
154488	155049	I think so.
155069	156751	It's super tiny.
156891	162038	It's like one of those ones that doesn't hurt, but occasionally you'll brush it, and then you feel that it's there.
162139	167386	It's not like it's painful, it's just like it's there.
167406	169849	You know what it tends to be a lot of the times?
170510	174876	It's not a splinter, it ends up being a beard hair that gets jammed into my...
175042	191548	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
191528	195513	That's why you trim.
196414	217182	That's why you trim the murder mittens.
217162	221648	We're going to need to get one of those freaking slings where they can't do anything until they get you.
221668	223170	Because that's the only way we're going to be able to train them.
223271	224372	Or Rob.
224432	224993	Or the vet.
225013	226255	Let me do it.
226275	227416	Oh, you want to come?
227737	230481	May the odds be ever in your favor.
231923	238272	I will show you how to two-person cut the death mittens.
238732	239053	All right.
239213	240695	I'd be curious to see that.
240715	242157	I do mittens on my own.
242744	245190	Well, Midna probably cooperates a little more than ours.
245210	246012	No, she doesn't.
246373	256618	She's a hissy little bitch, and she bats her paws around, and she doesn't try to eat my arm, bite me, but she'll snap.
257324	265752	What I'm curious about besides cat grooming tips is Loki has a video game playing behind him tonight.
265772	271077	Because we do tape live, of course, every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific.
271637	275481	Twitch.tv slash VOG Network right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
275561	278304	Except Bobby Blackwolf's not on tonight.
278324	283749	He is already out at Summer Games Done Quick, which we'll bring up again later in the show.
283889	285070	But if you...
285050	309825	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
309805	338023	Call of Duty Warzone, clearly
338003	342452	It's the Beavis and Butthead Super Nintendo or Genesis?
343033	346460	Yeah, Super Nintendo because I just saw it do the pixelation effect.
346841	348485	I maybe rented this game once.
348645	349707	I do not remember it.
350088	352553	What brought this game to mind tonight, Loki?
353410	372870	Call of Duty Warzone Beavis and Butthead
372850	391467	Skydance
391447	420897	I just know they've been talking about that stuff but I don't know I can't follow the drama in my own life let alone the South Park creators over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network we do tape live of course on Sunday nights and Ranmari in chat bringing up an old reference saying Super Metroid greater than and then cut off there with Chrono Trigger and I hope you all know by now the real answer is
420877	422359	There's room in my heart for both.
422880	430369	But there's this long-running, I don't even know if I'd call it an in-joke because jokes are funny, but that Super Metroid is better than Chrono Trigger or vice versa.
430429	431771	Bobby strongly believes the other.
431791	432832	You can just call it a meme by now.
432952	433934	Yeah, it's a meme.
433954	435796	Yeah, I guess a meme is a good way to put it.
436236	447310	But I do find the humor in the fact that Bobby Blackwolf is hosting the Super Metroid speed run because in that argument, he would always say, no, Chrono Trigger is the best Super Nintendo game ever made.
447371	448572	I always said Super Metroid.
448552	456909	And so I do find it funny that with all that back and forth, now he gets to do the Super Metroid run and has to be the hype guy for that run.
457069	461839	So there is, you know, I'm enjoying this even sitting at home.
462541	465126	Summer Games done quick so far.
465106	470591	Rinmari also says in chat, clearly we need a ROM hack that mashes both games up.
470611	472072	You know, that could totally be a thing.
472112	474394	They do those randomizers.
474454	486285	I was playing that one once upon a time that was Metroid and The Legend of Zelda, the original, where you would go into a dungeon in Zelda and you'd turn up in Metroid and then you'd go down an elevator in Metroid and now you're back in Zelda.
486305	491590	It's a cool concept, but my brain could not handle the randomy.
491870	495113	I'm making up a new word, the randomy in those games.
495093	496195	That was that.
496756	499622	All right, let's get into our kickoff topic tonight.
499642	508358	So there's a lot of interesting stuff going on with this petition around the Stop Killing Games movement.
508479	510823	Loki, are you up to speed on what's going on with this?
511748	512730	I don't know.
513371	515915	There's a lot of drama involved with it.
517418	527476	Taking the drama out of it, there was another push by a lot of content creators and whatnot to get the petition over the line.
527596	536372	So they've essentially had a petition with the UK and I think the EU regarding...
537112	551182	I guess in their process with Parliament, you put a petition together, it reaches a million signers, that then they discuss it on the floor of Parliament or just bring up the topic essentially.
551202	557736	It doesn't mean it's going into law, it's more of like bringing it before them to discuss whether...
557716	561844	They have to talk about the issue.
562606	563688	They can't just avoid it.
563788	568237	And this is the one that got associated with the crew, right?
568337	578577	Ubisoft sunsetted the original crew, and this petition started going around for, you know, which is labeled Stop Killing Games, which is essentially to...
578557	586627	hold companies liable to when they sell these games, they need to keep servers open or they need to allow people to have their own private servers.
587007	591612	There needs to be a way for the game to be able to be able to be continued.
591793	598501	Essentially, you shouldn't be buying a game you can only play for three years or in the case of some games, a lot less time.
599001	601204	So that's that's at the root of all this.
601304	604007	Just in case you're not aware of what this petition is all about.
604426	619356	Yeah, and so they did manage to get over the one million signature mark, but because there is a risk that people might be spoofing signatures on the internet, even though these these are government forms, though, so that is a crime.
619376	622402	People signing things, see more butts on the internet.
622502	623244	Are you kidding?
623685	624426	What?
624406	628491	Anyway, so... Or Cord Holio, I'm on theme, Loki.
628871	640644	They're looking to get more signatures than what's required just to account for any that may be thrown out for not being correctly signed or invalid stuff.
641105	642466	So they're working on that.
642486	643988	So the EU one has crossed.
644008	647071	They're still waiting for more signatures on the UK one.
648032	648793	Um...
648773	653339	And then, yeah, and so there's been kind of back and forth with that.
653479	671102	I know that there was an advocacy group for major gaming studios that have basically pushed back on it, saying private servers are not always viable alternatives, options for players, the protections we put in place to secure players' data, remove illegal content.
671082	673165	Combat Unsafe Community, blah, blah, blah, whatever.
673305	676590	That's the UK's version of the ESA speaking.
676610	682037	So they're pushing back on it saying, basically what I'm hearing is, one, it's too hard.
682238	683900	Two, it's too expensive.
684381	691410	Three, it would cause game publishers to not do this anymore, which is kind of, I think, I thought what people wanted.
691470	693293	So I, you know, but...
693914	696018	As an advocacy group, they're going to respond.
696580	697762	Live service game.
697782	698985	I mean, you're the ones doing it.
699085	708184	And also, I have a hard time believing that companies that make billions of dollars off of microtransactions can't afford to create an end of life plan for their game.
708444	709005	Yeah.
709025	709426	Please.
709967	710809	Yeah.
710789	716978	Well, okay, so what's interesting is there is some sort of prominent streamer out there.
717179	717719	I don't know.
718561	720163	I don't know these streamers.
720504	721225	I do, I do.
721245	721926	So it's Thor.
721946	723047	It's Pirate Software.
723067	725311	He's big in the scene.
725511	727154	He ex-Blizzard dev.
727975	733623	His dad was the WoW guy from the South Park episode.
734364	738771	Basically, his dad was at Blizzard before Blizzard was Blizzard, so that type of thing.
738751	747816	So he's been outspoken about it because he is a game developer, and he has said that for smaller indie studios...
748218	757030	These requirements may be too much for them to handle, and so also pushing back on some of the more finer details.
757071	760696	I think, though, I mean, I'm trying to just put it this way.
760836	763059	Like, I was just thinking about this earlier over dinner, actually.
763159	770069	Like, not only would stop, you know, protecting games and stuff like that and just layoffs and all this stuff.
770089	770850	It's just like...
772028	786493	more and more in the world like it's hard to find joy in things that we're doing like the world around us seems to be a chaotic mess that is just ever so crushing us down by it and then now we have like the game industry stuff where
787013	789640	They're just treating people as disposable.
790502	792487	Corporations treating people like nothing.
793188	797780	All of it down for the bottom line of their shareholders.
797800	801148	That's really their only concern about anything.
801730	802592	It's just...
804327	804928	Where's the fun?
805790	807113	Can we find the fun again?
807814	808976	That's what I would like.
809097	817454	I mean, I get it that there could be some challenges, but once again, I think that would be more something that's hammered out when they consider that as a law.
818295	819718	Maybe there are some exceptions.
819798	821722	Maybe it's only for certain size companies.
821783	824007	Maybe it's for whatever.
824105	839295	typically though I find that a lot of folks see or understand a bit more that if a smaller game studio is unable to keep a title going it's a little more understandable versus like
839275	853708	and EA that keeps releasing games year after year after year and then they shut the servers off after a few years because that fight night wasn't doing well or whatever the case may be.
853808	854770	So it's
855965	871240	it's a little bit more understandable there but once again any smaller indie game studios I don't think necessarily are making these big always online games always online games anyways so like I don't know well and I see
871220	873162	chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
873202	877307	TigerClaw says, Pirate Software, he's earned the ire of the gaming community out there.
877367	880251	And I did notice that, too, that this guy's been getting a lot of hate.
880351	882854	He's also a bit rude as well.
882934	887860	Yeah, and I don't know the guy, and if he has an unpopular opinion, then so be it.
887900	891464	But people on the internet need to calm the fuck down sometimes.
891645	891945	Right.
891925	894668	Not everybody's going to agree with you all the time.
894688	895209	I like him.
895229	897311	I don't necessarily agree with his opinion.
897351	901797	But once again, it's fine to have differing opinions.
902297	907684	And I think the how does this affect indie and small developers is a fair counterpoint.
907804	908344	Like, it is.
908485	909346	It's a fair counterpoint.
909426	914492	I don't think it changes my feelings that something has to be done, especially with large shows.
914592	916494	I have an idea, but I'll let you finish, Loki.
916514	917275	I have an idea, though.
917255	925424	Well, essentially though, they're blaming him for the stalling of the movement in the first place because he's such a prominent figure.
925925	929108	But I get it, it's fine to have differing opinions.
929228	941061	It's also, maybe people may not be on board with your opinion as much when you tell them to eat your entire ass when it comes to these things.
941662	943684	You are going to get what you give, yeah.
944221	946886	So it's a little, you know, I get it.
947046	947667	It's fine.
947687	951374	You know, and this would directly affect you if it were to go into place.
951754	953778	But let's like realistically look at this.
953798	954700	Is this going to happen?
955161	957144	God, no, nothing good ever happens.
957164	959128	So like, of course, it's never going to go through.
959188	965759	But like, it's still nice to try to at least show these, you know, game companies that we're not going to put up with this crap.
965960	966060	Yeah.
966344	971970	Here's kind of where my brain is going with, like, how do we resolve this whole thing?
972010	992250	And I'm going to fully admit, I'm speaking off the cuff here, and I haven't fully thought these out, and I'm sure y'all are ready to poke holes in this, but this is the direction my brain is kind of going in, because I'm thinking that what tends to happen is that you have these large companies, especially a Nintendo out there, that really likes to legally sort of
992230	998400	claim the protections on games, even if they're games that are no longer sold, no longer out there or whatever.
998440	1005311	And usually in Nintendo's case, at least, it happens to do with trademark because they don't want Mario to end up in porn and things like that.
1005371	1010319	So they have to protect their trademark, I guess, on Mario and things like that.
1010360	1013605	And so I think that's kind of what the other bigger companies lean on.
1013625	1018052	But I don't think smaller companies or indie companies as much are going to be
1018032	1023199	leaning on intellectual property to sort of save themselves as a game doesn't do very well.
1023560	1033875	I would think most Indian small studios are of the mindset that if, you know, a fan movement wants to try to save the game, then so be it.
1033895	1040985	And to me, I think the answer sort of lies in the
1040965	1064322	is that when you take these games offline that you have been selling, they should not really have the same types of enforceable sort of copyright and trademark protections on them that would allow people who legally own the game to do things like put the discs in a PC, decompile, do what they need to do to be able to run a private server on their own terms.
1064342	1067968	They should be able to do that without those sorts of fear of repercussions.
1067948	1074960	It's kind of a similar concept to what I've said before on this program about, you know, Hollywood's been doing this a lot, right?
1075000	1079849	Like Zaslav and Warner Brothers, you know, that Catwoman movie that, no, it wasn't Cat, no, it was Catwoman.
1080169	1081111	It was Catwoman.
1081151	1081772	No, Batgirl.
1081852	1082894	It was Batgirl.
1082914	1084998	No, the Catwoman movie came out, it was terrible, it was Batgirl.
1085258	1086801	It was supposed to come out and was...
1086781	1090366	Apparently not bad, but the whole thing ended up being a tax write-off.
1090386	1094392	And then there was the Coyote and Acme, which I guess is now actually getting released.
1094452	1097637	The same company that did the recent Porky Pay.
1097878	1100662	But it was in limbo for a while.
1100682	1104207	Did they get to write that off still?
1104227	1104908	I don't know.
1104888	1106470	and then they sold it?
1106731	1107972	That sounds like fraud.
1108914	1127239	But I have always said if you are a company like that and you are writing off on your taxes, you are paying less taxes, you are not giving the public, you are saying we're not using this piece of media so essentially that piece of media ought to belong to the public.
1127679	1133427	That is my long-handed way of saying Batgirl ought to be a public domain film.
1133407	1135709	at this point because it was a tax write-off.
1136130	1137791	Batgirl ought to be a public domain film.
1137871	1148402	That should be the cause and the effect so it really causes companies like Warner Brothers to think about should we be doing these as tax write-offs because this will be something that is in the hands of the public domain.
1148502	1151324	They shouldn't even be getting tax write-offs anyways for that stuff.
1151505	1155729	Honestly, in my opinion, why are we bailing out these billion-dollar companies?
1156249	1160173	Oh, because... I mean...
1160153	1181706	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1182108	1186975	Yeah, E3VL says actors and those that work on it don't get the royalties though, but they're not getting it with the tax write-offs either.
1187295	1188998	They're not getting anything right now.
1189018	1190340	So I don't know.
1190360	1193364	And again, I fully realize these are theories.
1193765	1198692	I'm not the type to throw something out on a social media site and say that's all there is to it.
1198712	1199934	There's nuance in everything.
1200234	1205702	These are ideas that have to be baked out a little more, but I think the answer is rooted in that, if that makes sense.
1205682	1209105	And I think the answer to this is somewhat rooted in that too.
1209125	1215371	So what I mean is, let's say that you have a large studio that puts out a big game, a Concord, let's say.
1215391	1219835	And you sign that, you digitally sign the EULA.
1219875	1225680	Whenever you connect to one of these games as a service game, anytime you do it, you're accepting some type of agreement, right?
1225700	1227762	You're accepting an online agreement and all this stuff.
1227782	1230845	And it basically says, you won't try to hack the game.
1230905	1232866	You won't try to do your own servers.
1232886	1235689	You're only allowed to play on their servers only, da-da-da-da-da, and all this stuff.
1235669	1243284	When the servers for a game get pulled, that online agreement should be null and void.
1243304	1244786	That should be the first thing that happens.
1245227	1251940	Because the corporation has not held up their end of the bargain.
1251920	1256068	So that agreement that you agreed to should be null and void.
1256148	1267631	And so that would include at that point that if you want to run your own pirate servers, decompile whatever needs to be done, I think that's what should happen.
1267651	1269895	Now, I understand with this whole effort, they want...
1269875	1289740	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1290243	1316959	and with Phantasy Star Online Blue Burst when they when Sega shut it down and they shut down the servers they put out a tool so that your characters could be exported and they basically they didn't I don't think they put out the software correct me if I'm wrong Jamie because I don't remember I didn't follow the ins and outs of it I don't think they put out the software for people to run their own servers but they basically said if you run your own server we're gonna turn a blind eye to the whole thing we're not gonna look at it and they did you know some tools
1316939	1319402	Yeah, there was a character export tool.
1319482	1320803	That was the main thing I remember.
1321765	1326730	But to this day, there are still Blue Burst servers running on out there.
1326991	1327932	You know what else is out there?
1327952	1329954	And this is funny because this ties into my gaming week.
1330575	1332297	You know what I've been playing?
1332317	1346473	On a GameCube emulator, I've been playing Phantasy Star Online Volume 1 and 2 because you can actually, in the config files, you route the broadband adapter to a different IP and there are PSO private servers for that as well.
1346453	1349545	I can do that with my Dreamcast version.
1349980	1351421	Ooh, that's a really good question.
1351601	1354304	I bet there's documentation on those sites how to do it.
1354404	1355085	I bet you could.
1355705	1359429	So, it's probably something to do with setting up the DNS servers or something to do that.
1359449	1360029	So, yeah.
1360730	1366055	And so, TigerClaw points out in chat, Sega's the only company that doesn't mind modders and fan games based on their IPs.
1366335	1373261	I'm saying that Sega did kind of put a blueprint out there for, I think, what gamers are really looking for the companies to do.
1373461	1379667	If you're folding, if you're throwing in the cards, then you should release some of those, you know,
1380558	1391311	And if they're not going to, I mean, I guess I can see where they shouldn't be compelled to or obligated to, especially if these companies end up laying off employees and stuff that would, you know, be putting that stuff out.
1391331	1399561	But I think it should be open so that if people do that on their own means, there should be no ability for the company to have legal recourse against that.
1399981	1401283	That's what I'm saying at the end of the day.
1401763	1407490	Basically, if a company shuts the game down, they have no legal recourse to go after people trying to protect their investments.
1407510	1409873	That's the long and the short of what I'm trying to say.
1410916	1415003	I think... I'm trying to remember what...
1415573	1422384	Some of the scenarios that they were proposing are like how it could be abused.
1422404	1429536	Once again, though, like you're putting the cart before the horse as far as like trying to figure out how a system like this would be before the system's even in place.
1429556	1439493	I know one thing the video game, you know, group in the UK said was that, oh, it would it would lead to like bullying, harassment and those types.
1439513	1441817	It's like that shit already happens in games.
1441797	1458642	that kind of felt a little bit like reaching to me you know what I mean like they can't protect the integrity of the servers and things like that and it's like you're right you can't and I mean like okay so after it's offline and I get it so they'll be like oh well if someone gets bullied on like say uh
1458622	1462227	on an Ubisoft game that's discontinued.
1462247	1463890	Then it makes the game look bad.
1464030	1472382	They're saying that makes our game look bad because now that headline runs on Fox News that says a six-year-old child was bullied playing the crew.
1472402	1473824	They're going to do it anyways.
1473844	1477169	They're going to do it anyways.
1477429	1481575	It's dumb to assume that people are so brain-dead that they're going to...
1481555	1482596	Okay, then fine.
1482796	1484599	You can't have it both ways then.
1484619	1503581	If they're too brain dead to be able to realize that the game that's discontinued that they have to play through a private server is not the same game as when it was running, but also they are intelligent enough to be able to set up their game so they can connect to a private server to play said game.
1503601	1505183	Like, you can't have it both ways.
1505343	1506685	They can't be...
1506867	1508984	Smart enough, but not also dumb.
1509952	1511646	It's just, it's silly.
1511980	1515445	I'm going to say at the end of the day, I support this movement.
1515505	1522454	And the reason why is because I think for years and years and years, the corporations have been setting the rules.
1522474	1535252	The Ubisofts, the EAs, hell, the Square Enixes, the, you know, the Nintendos have been setting the rules because they put out these user agreements and you have to agree to it to play the game.
1535272	1536113	And there's, that's it.
1536253	1537335	You don't, you don't have a choice.
1537675	1538977	You didn't get a say on what's in that.
1538997	1539658	You didn't get it.
1539638	1546689	To me, this is the people saying, all right, for years you have said this is what you want and you've set the rules.
1547090	1547851	Now you know what?
1548051	1549834	This is what we want.
1549854	1553059	And these are our rules that you need to agree to.
1553600	1554401	And I think that's fair.
1554461	1558388	That's why my youngest son agreed to all of those terms so it doesn't bind legally.
1562995	1565038	Now that's outside the box thinking.
1565272	1583044	but yes, I think it's time for us to have the corporations sign some agreements quite honestly and if it means that they need to follow any of those agreements if it means they need to think twice before they decide a game needs to always be online, then so be it
1583648	1601303	I think they should eat themselves and what I mean by that is because right now in the court system we have a battle between AI generators and the data, totally legal that they've trained their stuff off of and then we have
1601519	1608887	These companies where they've clearly been inspired by and totally not stolen all of the data from.
1609848	1623663	I mean, you had, what was it, already legally, there was a court case that allowed physical books to be scanned in and used for training data completely 100% legally.
1623943	1626666	So I can go to my library and
1627068	1632617	Borrow all these books, scan them in for my training data, and just create AI off of that.
1633198	1636404	Totally legal.
1636424	1638908	That's another thing that's going to keep coming to a head in courts.
1638928	1645038	And I know there's some court cases that have already been decided, but I think that's a whole other issue.
1646380	1652130	I think it does all come down to copyright ownership issues.
1652110	1654194	You know, usage rights, all of that.
1654214	1657961	I feel like all of that was written in an era before the internet.
1657981	1660165	And it's been struggling to catch up ever since.
1660185	1666998	As Joe and Hunter Matt in chat says it at twitch.tv slash VOG Network, consumer protection is still trying to catch up to gaming, I guess.
1667018	1667319	100%.
1667339	1668581	100%.
1669062	1671426	And a lot of other types of new media, too.
1671907	1673210	It's still trying to catch up with AI.
1673270	1675013	It's still trying to catch up with streaming.
1675752	1678556	It'll get to a point where it's too much for people.
1678576	1679238	I get it.
1679919	1690035	Gamers, especially gamers of long-running franchises, Madden, FIFA, essentially just get beaten down every year with the microtransactions.
1690055	1692799	And some people are completely...
1694129	1722921	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1723610	1747828	Yeah, absolutely.
1748838	1754608	Alright, well on that note, let's continue on because obviously we have some other big headlines we need to get to.
1754648	1760398	But first, we always like to start off in talking about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.
1761039	1766408	Oh, DarkSakura's back, so I will start with DarkSakura and go, how was your gaming week?
1766388	1766849	Oh, you're good.
1766869	1769012	Got some real life stuff going on.
1769032	1769393	All good.
1772377	1774100	Just the usual stuff.
1774360	1778947	Mass Effect, Dead by Daylight, trying to get through the event.
1780971	1782393	Palia, that's about it.
1783635	1783955	All right.
1784376	1784776	Good times.
1786119	1786900	Loki, we'll go to you then.
1786920	1787721	How was your gaming week?
1788292	1790515	I've been playing mainly Minecraft.
1790735	1791957	As usual, I know it's shocking.
1792878	1800689	We updated to 121.6 this week, so we have the happy gas now and just kind of messing with that stuff.
1801110	1806958	I've been building a massive battle arena for our sleep game.
1806938	1836270	that will be participating in here pretty soon so I've been just kind of designing and now gathering materials for that thing working on my mega game stuff as well to start the whole early design process part of that and then aside from that a tiny bit of Bellatro and yeah just looking at my Steam library it's like yeah I could play all these games I'll buy more but I'm not going to play them
1837043	1866055	that's a problem I have a problem, I will admit I have the same problem but you know what though, I like it I like having that library because it does give me the option that I can go in there someday and play that stuff it's kind of like realistically, if I were to collect physical games I have no place to put that stuff I don't know anything about that of course you wouldn't
1866625	1880398	but like yeah it's just not all over my kitchen and the offices and under pinball tables it's just like even my collection that I have I don't actually play them um
1881087	1909103	I don't know I like to support smaller game studios I like to purchase games that look interesting I get it I will eventually get to them at some point I can't say that about my whole library because there's like 1200 now someday when I give up Minecraft I'll dig into the Steam library but until then I'm going to consume more and how and how
1909488	1909909	All right.
1910229	1913655	Well, before we get to my gaming week... Now with more sodium.
1913675	1917341	Before we get to my gaming week, Jamie, let me know... Go ahead and do your gaming week.
1917602	1918563	Okay.
1918704	1920947	Then for my gaming week, let me think.
1921368	1923732	It's been a lot of the same sorts of things.
1923772	1926777	So I'm still playing Fantasy Life, still very addicted to that.
1926797	1933048	Diablo 4 started a new season, so Season 9, which does this new twist with Nightmare Dungeons.
1933028	1950565	Diablo IV Diablo VIII
1950545	1966562	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1966542	1967203	D.A.B.O.
1967243	1988382	4
1988362	2015061	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2015041	2023914	And yes, I know PSO2 is still a thing, and I tried to do PSO2, but I feel like PSO2 has like a content overload problem.
2024956	2031225	But to be fair, I haven't visited it in a long time since it first came out on Xbox, and maybe it's a little better now.
2031245	2034870	So I should try to check it out again just to make sure I give it a fair shot.
2035491	2037454	But that was kind of the issue I had with it.
2037434	2039576	Compartmentalized, if that makes sense.
2039836	2044360	Yeah, like PSO is really easy to kind of, I think something about maybe the simplification.
2044380	2049605	Although I keep, I'm trying to always use the right stick on my controller, which didn't exist, right?
2049945	2052768	Like you always had to hit the L button to like reset your view.
2052808	2054589	And I'm just having to get used to that again.
2054650	2058273	That's the thing where I'm like, oh yeah, I forgot that this was a thing on the old PSO.
2058293	2060134	But yeah, I love it.
2060154	2064418	Yeah, SS200Matt says, gotta soup up the computer just to play Space Cadet Pinball on Windows.
2064819	2066220	Dude, that's what I feel like I've been doing.
2066260	2067441	Like brand new video card
2067421	2069444	GameCube emulators.
2069885	2071186	Let's go.
2072308	2073930	Well, you know, I could totally play too.
2074691	2075372	Yes, you should.
2075393	2075973	That'd be fun.
2075993	2077696	That'd be a fun stream to do sometime.
2077876	2078737	I have the means.
2079438	2080139	Play some PSO.
2080159	2081261	We should do it.
2081281	2081902	Okay.
2082783	2083124	Let's see.
2083144	2083444	What else?
2083524	2084586	Is that all for my gaming week?
2084606	2085447	I think so.
2086658	2089041	Yeah, if there's something else, I can't think of it in the moment.
2089061	2097571	So, okay, then with that, before we get to the news, Jamie, you said you need to cut out a little early tonight because you have some stuff going on IRL, which happens.
2097992	2106182	So we're going to fast forward a little bit and get to your segment because, you know, once a month, you don't just do a classic game of the week.
2106202	2111348	You do a classic game that is going to go to the arcades or has gone to the arcades.
2111669	2112430	So let's roll the bump.
2112930	2114472	Console first, arcade second.
2123159	2130991	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
2131011	2135398	It's time for the classic game of the week.
2135418	2139605	All right, Jamie, what is the console to arcade game of this month?
2140907	2141548	Guitar Hero.
2142870	2143311	Good pick.
2144253	2166447	Yeah, so I mean we know Guitar Hero, the franchise has been out for a while and then died and then there were hints of it coming back and I mean the first one was out in 2005 so it is more than a classic game but the one that I am talking about is the...
2167051	2177190	After a number of expansions mined, Activision and Red Octane put in some work with a company called Basic Fun Inc.
2177210	2184624	to do guitar... I said the wrong words.
2184805	2188131	Activision and Konami...
2188718	2207858	Guitar Hero Arcade
2207838	2224395	but it reduced some of the features like the whammy bar, star power button you can only activate it by lifting the guitar so you have limited use there and practice modes but you could still download new songs for the cabinet from the internet
2224561	2248206	and the game though did come under some scrutiny by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, the ASCAP who thought that it qualified as the equivalent of public performances and that the game operators needed to pay royalties, additional fees and
2249165	2277687	Alas, it was not meant to be Alas
2279219	2281364	All asked.
2281384	2286295	This is one of those games where you knew it had to come up eventually, but I don't know.
2286355	2288279	I didn't love it in the arcade.
2288660	2292628	No, neither did I. But it's worth the mention.
2292869	2294292	I mean, it just...
2294272	2313867	Well, we...
2314032	2319943	We did have a ton of Guitadora, and we had the Triumvirate, you remember?
2319963	2323330	Sure, sure, but it was never going to catch on mainstream until they got... But they didn't do it in the U.S.
2323390	2323891	Exactly.
2323991	2327217	They tried to do Guitar Freaks in the U.S., remember?
2327818	2329201	Yeah, Rock Revolution.
2329221	2329662	It did not...
2330182	2331124	No, no, no, no, no.
2331244	2332987	I'm talking about in the arcade.
2333007	2333288	Yeah.
2333668	2334490	Oh, yeah, they did.
2334510	2334890	They did.
2334951	2335251	You're right.
2335271	2336493	They did do one version in the arcade.
2336694	2344748	But then, you know, there's that and then there's like these actual like, you know, guitar songs that everybody heard growing up, you know?
2345993	2353647	As Ranmari points out, Round 1 USA just got the new Gitarra cabs and fancy new 3-screen deluxe cabinets in their U.S.
2353748	2354269	region.
2354289	2364508	Yes, that is true, because the nice thing is that Round 1 has sort of brought back, or at least kind of opened the door, I guess, to...
2364488	2370456	The Japanese games being imported, you know, legally, quote unquote, although it was like it was always a gray area.
2370777	2383694	But, you know, the thing that I wanted to go back to was that, you know, especially in bringing up Guitadora is that they were originally arcade that went to the home, you know, the home consoles.
2384235	2389783	And then Guitar Hero came out for the home consoles as we tested in my living room at my old house.
2390163	2390824	I remember that.
2390884	2393027	Well, I wasn't there, but you guys were.
2393007	2395230	and then to arcade after that.
2395290	2397353	So it's sort of like it went full circle from there.
2397834	2402962	But, you know, the way things are, people want to play these things in their home and make a party out of it.
2402982	2408770	They don't necessarily want to go to an arcade where people try to change their baby's diaper on the keyboard mania table.
2408790	2413717	I think that story is still on YouTube, by the way, for some of our newer OLR fans.
2413938	2415640	I think if you dig on the...
2416177	2417318	Told the woman off?
2417899	2419760	No, no, no, no, no.
2419820	2421342	Playing Guitar Hero at your house.
2421702	2430690	I wasn't there, but you and Loki were on one of the local news stations because didn't they bring the fucking guy from Red Octane to your house?
2430710	2431470	Yeah, they did.
2431931	2433752	And they made me hide all my Bimani stuff.
2434393	2435274	Oh, yeah, that's right.
2435294	2439618	You had to hide all your Konami stuff.
2439698	2440759	Just the Bimani stuff.
2440979	2443141	Yeah, that's so funny.
2443161	2445863	I think we had a guy from here.
2447716	2449839	Anyway, yeah, so it's out there on YouTube somewhere.
2449859	2450660	I'm almost positive.
2450841	2452043	Tiger Claw is probably looking for it right now.
2452063	2454146	Yeah, we had all this stuff in the corner of my living room.
2454166	2456269	I think it's on our Orange Lounge Radio YouTube channel, actually.
2456329	2465343	I think that one and the old KCRA clip of Dave Walker, who retired years ago, introducing the story of podcasting.
2465363	2469409	That's the infamous, oh, it's so much fun, clip of you.
2469830	2470811	Yeah.
2472273	2473335	I still have our newspaper.
2474075	2475477	Oh yeah, the newspaper article too.
2475637	2476138	Good times.
2476198	2477380	Remember when we were famous?
2477400	2479242	Alright.
2479262	2480003	Now we're infamous.
2480504	2481365	Not really.
2481385	2482367	We did get the Guinness book.
2482467	2486132	I guess I can't complain because we did get the Guinness book last year, so I can't bitch too much.
2486192	2487714	But yeah.
2487914	2490218	Even chat GPT recognizes it now.
2490258	2491720	I'm just going to say that.
2491740	2495705	Oh, I guess that's... I never thought to ask, but it's good.
2496086	2497648	I will put the clip in chat.
2497668	2498109	There you go.
2498389	2500091	Oh, you found it!
2500111	2501253	It's on our YouTube channel.
2501333	2503356	I knew it was on our YouTube somewhere.
2503488	2509439	We also have the original KCRA thing.
2509699	2511523	Oh, it's my old TV!
2513446	2516331	Oh my god, it's my chin!
2516952	2518075	I'm just fast-forwarding through it.
2519096	2522222	Oh my god, Matt, you look so young.
2523164	2524045	How old was this?
2524085	2527650	Now you're going to make me bring it up while we're live here.
2527771	2528592	Hold on, hold on.
2528672	2529653	Now I got to look at this.
2531616	2540248	You know what's funny?
2540369	2541050	You know what's funny?
2541530	2544835	You can see my drum mania.
2545405	2546810	It behind the TV.
2547071	2551327	I was coming from work, that's why I had a work shirt on.
2551890	2553636	And my 2DX stuff.
2553797	2557069	I wasn't there because, oh yeah, that's the old Red Octane guy.
2558112	2563321	That's... I wasn't able to go at all because I was working that night.
2563462	2565345	Or that day.
2565405	2568491	This is an old, old clip.
2568591	2569272	Anyway.
2569493	2571096	I'm so glad I had my surgery.
2571256	2571556	The end.
2571677	2571937	Anyway.
2572037	2572318	Alright.
2572338	2573540	That's enough of Walk Down Memory Lane.
2573560	2574341	Sorry, podcast.
2574422	2577187	You just have to... It is on the Orange Nose Radio YouTube channel.
2577207	2578469	You just have to go way back.
2579230	2580112	Sort by oldest.
2580613	2581875	You can do that.
2581855	2585000	Just put DarkSakura, Loki, Guitar Hero, you'll find it.
2585221	2587244	I'm not in it, so don't search me.
2587444	2589888	Just go to the Orange Lounge Radio YouTube channel.
2590189	2591811	There's three buttons on there.
2591892	2592633	Click oldest.
2592833	2593795	It'll sort by oldest.
2594396	2594957	Ah, there you go.
2594977	2597701	I was going to say, because all the actual podcast episodes are mixed in now.
2597721	2598042	Be right.
2598102	2598903	You sort oldest.
2598923	2599344	It'll be there.
2599684	2600766	How to internet one-on-one.
2600786	2601347	All right.
2601367	2601808	DarkSakura.
2601828	2603971	We also have Dance Dance Revolution Wii on there.
2604532	2605714	I know you have to go.
2605835	2607357	Do you have a final thought for us?
2608028	2610074	Ugh, fuck.
2610094	2610575	No, thank you.
2612139	2614747	No, just... Alright.
2615328	2620663	I'm gonna eat this lovely muffin that Alan brought for me while Loki gets into our news story today.
2620863	2621264	How about that?
2621345	2622207	Ooh!
2622558	2623459	Muffin!
2624581	2626403	I'm gonna go have a protein shake.
2626683	2627545	Alright, have fun.
2628886	2629107	Bye!
2629788	2634173	Alright, so Loki, we're gonna go over to you with... Oops, not that one, this one.
2634554	2636496	We're gonna go over to you with the news for tonight.
2636516	2640842	Let's get to our top headline, which unfortunately is not something to consume a muffin to.
2641603	2643365	It's actually really shitty news.
2643486	2644948	Is it not time for muffins?
2644968	2647631	It's time for depression and sadness.
2647711	2649153	Depression muffin!
2649534	2652177	Video game industry layoff muffin!
2652713	2666319	So, it was confirmed that Microsoft was laying off about 9,000 jobs, 9,100 jobs if you want to be more ballpark about that.
2666339	2669766	It is hitting a wide variety of their different studios.
2671268	2674755	There is a memo that they put out to staff, which...
2675528	2697672	wasn't even directed towards staff it was directed towards shareholders which is just some bullshit right there which they made but I'm not even gonna read it because it's just just just imagine PR speak about how we need to make these cuts but also we're super you know we're doing really well we're doing so well this is the best time ever but we also have to make these cuts
2697652	2699234	Because of reasons, of course.
2700095	2702077	That's just, you know, how shareholders work.
2703699	2708084	So there was a lot of cuts that was done at King, of course.
2708104	2711969	They lost 200 employees, or roughly 10% of their workforce.
2713010	2720919	They have closed down, cut off a lot of different studios as well, cancelled many projects.
2721000	2723102	So let's talk about some of those cancellations.
2723757	2726743	Perfect Dark reboot not coming out anymore.
2728266	2738728	That has been cancelled and they've also not only have they cancelled Perfect Dark but also the other rare project Everwild which has been in production for well
2739248	2741290	A very long time, over 10 years at this point.
2742891	2745514	So that is also disappointing.
2745534	2752520	There was some cuts at the Elder Scrolls Online Studios as well, at Bethesda Online, ZeniMax Online, that's right.
2753401	2758866	They had a new looter shooter game that they said was Blade Runner meets Destiny 2.
2759086	2760347	Sounds just like Destiny 2.
2760367	2765331	That also got cancelled as well.
2766192	2769255	And, I mean, I wonder if it's because of some of this, you know,
2769235	2789370	I don't know what you're talking about.
2790532	2791273	Something like that.
2791493	2791794	I don't know.
2791814	2792835	I heard there was some game.
2792975	2794137	Zenimax was working on it.
2794157	2795158	Yes, it was.
2795178	2797221	It was something that he liked.
2797261	2800165	It basically said that it was a good game or something like that.
2800725	2801066	Cool.
2801286	2802087	That's why he canceled.
2802107	2803709	I'm sure it's because it was a good game.
2804690	2807694	Well, you remember the old Iwata quote, a bad game is bad forever.
2807714	2808916	A good game is good forever.
2809076	2810498	Or Phil Spencer kills it.
2811136	2812739	I think that's how the Iwata Club went, right?
2813279	2818187	I mean, you know what games could possibly never be good, of course, would be a new John Romero game.
2818287	2820150	So, you know, let's kill that as well.
2820250	2824918	So there's another Romero game studio game that is not coming out.
2825719	2828183	And of course, they made a
2828348	2829770	Statement about that as well.
2829970	2840322	Apparently it was they said they were working on new FPS in Unreal 5 and three years later it was cancelled.
2840342	2841984	So it's been in development for at least three years.
2842465	2844287	Great.
2844307	2844648	What else?
2846270	2853899	So I know that this is all very shocking and you're probably thinking like god damn what the hell are they thinking?
2854119	2857343	What are those C-suite people thinking?
2858032	2859255	What the hell are they doing?
2859796	2866752	Well, Phil Spencer wants you to know that despite the fact there's been all these massive layoffs, don't worry.
2867494	2868416	He's not going anywhere.
2868436	2869839	He's not retiring anytime soon.
2870140	2873908	So he'll be helping more of this bullshit for the near future as well.
2873948	2875652	So thank God for that.
2875632	2896763	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2896743	2913722	I can't continue to defend the man after this and I truly really believe that if he is making losses this big, if the impact on the workforce is this large and this many projects are going, that is a lack of leadership and he should have been one of the ones that left.
2915170	2915590	Period.
2915610	2916932	Full stop.
2917272	2926341	If this is a sign of misdirection, or these are games that should not have been made, he should be one to take the fall as well.
2926361	2927302	He should be dismissed.
2928043	2930785	I'm sorry to say, but not sorry to say.
2930966	2931346	I'm not.
2931766	2943658	I thought he was doing... I'm sitting here going... The parts that make no sense here, I thought Microsoft was in a place, Xbox, that was better than ever...
2943638	2954998	Game Pass is doing Gangbusters recently with a lot of the games that are on it right now even King I'm surprised that there was layoffs there because Candy Crush is doing Gangbusters as well so like
2955907	2962436	I understand that there are some redundancies post-mergers, but they already did that.
2962456	2963057	They already did that.
2963077	2964439	They've already claimed that one before.
2965080	2966662	So now what are we talking about?
2966782	2968324	And these are like canceled projects.
2968364	2976576	These are games that apparently were fun that they don't want to put out at all for whatever, you know, whether it's market conditions.
2976596	2980822	I don't fucking know why if a game is really fun, you don't put it out.
2980922	2985188	But there was an investment they didn't feel they needed to take, I guess.
2987142	2990386	Yeah, I don't know.
2990546	2996654	Honestly, I'm disappointed, obviously, with all that.
2998297	3001300	So here's another fun one that I saw as well.
3002041	3007108	Forza Motorsport is no more, following the cuts.
3007128	3008049	That blew my mind, too.
3008109	3010973	Why are all those people at Take-10 getting laid off?
3010953	3017584	Forza Horizon is the reason to be an Xbox gamer.
3017604	3020489	It's one of the best exclusive franchises they have.
3020849	3028742	They're working on the Fable game, which I realize it's taken a long time to cook, and maybe that's the problem with a lot of these.
3028722	3036172	Now, keep in mind, folks, there is a difference between Forza Motorsport and Forza Horizon.
3036713	3041199	Forza Motorsport was kind of that mainline Forza series that I think was up to seven games.
3041499	3043582	Was seven the most recent release?
3043602	3048168	And then I think what happened, Horizon... Or it was just Forza Motorsport.
3048188	3049650	They didn't even have like a...
3050305	3053329	But what happened along the way is that Horizon eclipsed it.
3053649	3054170	Let's be real.
3054250	3059757	Like, Horizon is the more... Because it's the more palpable one.
3059797	3062160	It's the one that you can pick up and run with.
3062220	3068868	It's the one with all of the accessibility features where all you have to do is fucking accelerate if that's what you need to do for the game.
3068948	3073674	You know, like, that's... Horizon is just the bigger franchise at this point.
3073694	3076338	But I'm still shocked... Right, and that's the big clarify with that, too.
3076418	3079722	That the studios still open to support the Horizon side, but...
3079702	3083146	Right, Jvmon in chat says Horizon is more casual friendly.
3083206	3084868	It can take on the Mario Karts of the world.
3084888	3085910	That's what it is.
3085930	3091276	And I would agree that Forza Motorsport, I mean, there's an audience for it, but the bang probably wasn't worth the buck there.
3091336	3100748	But laying off that entire team, why wouldn't you shift a really good chunk of those resources into pumping more into Horizon?
3100728	3108697	or putting out Horizon games more frequently or making them more robust or putting a little bit of that professionalism into Horizon.
3108818	3110359	Why would you not do that?
3113223	3125858	So on top of all that, so they also canceled or they've laid off a lot of different developers also working on Call of Duty because God forbid there's like there's I don't even know how many studios are working on Call of Duty.
3126038	3127460	So they did lay off a lot there.
3127480	3128541	It's across the entire
3128521	3156469	you know, games division as is and I think a lot of it has to do with the focus on Microsoft not necessarily Xbox, but Microsoft spending I think they're going to be spending 80 billion dollars on AI development over the course of this entire year which now brings us to the other fuck you that's part of this as well so after all these people were laid off they got an email um
3156955	3159198	for people that are going to Gamescom.
3159258	3162183	They said, we're excited to be heading to Gamescom 2025.
3162603	3165007	And also, we'll be contending.
3165047	3175942	We're offering an AI roundtable where you can provide us feedback on how you'd like to see us use AI tools and processes to make game development and publishing experience more efficient.
3177024	3179267	It's like the...
3180479	3184967	The icing on the cake, or the shit cake that it is with the layoffs and stuff.
3185027	3187852	It's like you're pushing all this generative AI stuff.
3188153	3196648	Nobody wants it, but you're going all in on it because you're trying to be the next Google of this tech space that is brand new.
3198215	3205508	I just... This AI thing drives me bonkers because these companies are about to learn the hard way.
3205548	3207912	You get what you pay for with this AI stuff.
3208093	3213502	I don't... AI can make your current employees better.
3213522	3216207	It can't replace your current employees.
3216187	3224159	It's a lesson that these companies are going to learn in an explosively negative way, which unfortunately, good.
3224379	3226663	They need to learn the lesson in a negative way.
3228966	3236898	People that have been advocating for this on the inside, the CEOs, the board, the upper managers, need to be held accountable when this all goes to shit.
3236918	3237539	They won't be.
3237559	3238380	That's the thing.
3238360	3257466	it's because they're they're making money for their shareholders and unfortunately the lesson won't be learned by them it'll be learned by employees that they lay off and then oh hey this this was absolute dog shit let's close this studio now because we used AI tools and no one's ever going to learn the lesson it's just going to be
3257446	3271810	As consumers, you just have to be vigilant and, once again, not pre-ordering your games so that you can be aware of what AI nonsense is being put into your games because they certainly like to seem to slip it in without anybody knowing.
3272010	3282508	Which is so weird because, you know, when you think that AI is so good and everybody loves it that, you know, you'd be proud to announce that, like, AI is in shit because, God forbid, like, all the...
3282488	3292540	Appliance manufacturers and everything else I don't want AI in are so proud to announce that AI is part of my refrigerator or some bullshit like that.
3292680	3295504	They're purposely hiding it because it's sloppy.
3295524	3303433	It's cheap bullshit that they're trying to pass off as actual artistic work.
3303453	3304755	And it's just going to be slop.
3304775	3305836	You're going to get slop.
3305876	3306857	Slop in, slop out.
3306937	3309340	It's not going to be good.
3309691	3324730	but just they have to learn that lesson and well like I said unfortunately it's not them learning the lesson the C-suite people no one's going to hold them to account it's going to be you know maybe the shareholders will if they don't make as much money but I mean they'll fire more people I guess
3325874	3343579	This is the world we live in.
3344555	3348601	That talks about a LinkedIn, which I believe is another Microsoft property, by the way.
3349683	3361660	So Matt Turnbull, who is an executive producer at Xbox Game Studios, made a post on LinkedIn basically saying, These are really challenging times, and if you're navigating a layoff or quietly preparing for one, you're not alone and don't have to go it alone.
3362181	3369432	I've been experimenting with ways to use LLM AI tools to help reduce the emotional and cognitive load that comes with job loss.
3369412	3373637	So you could do career planning prompts, resume and LinkedIn help.
3373657	3375059	Like, here's my current resume.
3375099	3376141	Give me three tailored versions.
3376541	3379745	Networking and outreach, emotional clarity and confidence.
3379765	3382048	I'm struggling with imposter syndrome after being laid off.
3382068	3385312	Can you help me reframe this experience in a way that reminds me what I'm good at?
3385332	3386494	But no, here's the kicker, Loki.
3386975	3393563	Then at the end of his LinkedIn post, he says, no AI tool is a replacement for your voice or your lived experience.
3394825	3404679	See, this is the only context I feel out of all of this and all of everything that we've talked about so far to which the proper response is to eat my entire ass.
3408304	3411148	Plus, can we just talk about LinkedIn in general?
3411709	3414032	LinkedIn is a bunch of bullshit.
3414072	3418078	I remember my company wanted me to set up a LinkedIn page for God knows what reason.
3418098	3419140	They wanted something.
3419160	3420562	They're like, you have to be on here.
3420622	3421583	It's so important.
3421984	3423185	You'll network.
3423205	3424427	I'm like, I...
3424407	3453385	so it is such a useless piece of shit if you just want to see people gassing themselves up that they're the smartest people on the fucking planet look no further than LinkedIn oh my god now look I there's things I like about LinkedIn my last two jobs I have found through LinkedIn so I will say something nice about LinkedIn I mean that that's that's the job search side of the the coin if you look at the social feed and the things that people post on there Jesus Christ
3453736	3470007	it's unreal but it's real but it's unreal anyway and not unreal because that's that's a game engine that's right that's a game engine that's way better than LinkedIn
3471353	3477586	But hey, that's okay, because LinkedIn, you're going to find lots of AI there, lots of prompts and stuff.
3477626	3486244	I'm sure that there's probably a course on how to just have generative AI just post a bunch of bullshit to your page, and you'll become super popular then.
3486264	3488769	You'll make it as a CEO eventually, I'm sure.
3489391	3489531	Mm-hmm.
3491030	3509916	that's that have a have co-pilot replace Phil Spencer then if AI is so fucking good have it run your have it make your decisions at your company then if it's so well no no no we we can't be replaced we are too too smart for that yeah it's just it's dumb
3510672	3510992	All right.
3511633	3528530	Well, if there is some good news to be had on the Xbox front this week, Helldivers 2, which was a big hit on the PlayStation 5, is coming to Xbox and all the Microsoft platforms this August because the exclusive window has basically is closing.
3528771	3534817	So, yeah, the Sony published Helldivers 2 will no longer be exclusive as of August.
3534837	3539802	So, yeah, Arrowhead Game Studios, Johan
3540355	3542439	I hope I said that right.
3542459	3547328	The chief creative officer said during a live stream, you've asked for more dudes.
3547368	3548490	We're sending more dudes.
3548910	3551776	For one and a half years, you've been fighting the enemies of democracy.
3551796	3555122	And one of the requests that you've always had is for us to send more dudes.
3555142	3559309	And the best way for us to be able to do that is to bring another platform into the fight.
3559289	3563520	So Xbox Series X and S will get the game August 26, $40.
3563661	3564623	Well, that's good.
3564643	3566328	They're not trying to charge $70 for it.
3566388	3568895	I think it was always a lower price.
3568935	3569577	It's always been $40.
3569938	3573467	Which is probably another reason why it's doing so well.
3573734	3601547	so there you go 18 months after launch uh more content to catch up on so good luck to the Xbox players um I don't know if there's a lot of people that are gonna be jumping in but I don't I mean it is a really good game I've heard nothing but really good things about it so I'm sure um I'm sure it's a good time so for those that are kind of confined to their gaming on Xbox now you have a chance to join in so good luck all right Loki what do you have uh talk about like
3602202	3606272	The wrong timeline, but okay, let's talk about how...
3606370	3613498	Hey, you know, you're playing Fortnite and stuff, and you're like, wow, I really want those skins, but they're just ridiculously expensive.
3613618	3614499	They're charging $50.
3615400	3619004	Maybe I should finance this, said nobody ever.
3619645	3621948	So that's what they're planning on doing.
3622448	3633441	Apparently, a payment provider, Affirm, has said they partnered with Xsolla to allow people to pay off in-game purchases of $50 or more via payment plans.
3634518	3649642	It goes without saying, and I shouldn't have to tell anybody, and I'm sure everybody is an adult here and understands, there is no reason whatsoever that you should purchase an in-game purchase on a payment plan.
3649662	3651845	It is clearly a scam.
3651965	3661420	It is clearly predatory in the sense that they're trying to get pre-owned people that have no financial responsibility.
3662108	3688943	And that they just, you know, impulsively buy, buy, buy, buy, buy, buy, buy And then they won't be able to make their payments They charge them the late fees, so on and so forth And it's only going to get worse, Loki With everything going on in the world You have a pair of eyes and ears You see what's going on in the news And you know that there's people that are going to be losing a lot And this type of predatory shit is only going to get worse I really need people And again, I think you are right I think most of the people...
3688923	3712720	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3712700	3720702	and I think y'all know better than you don't need a fucking $40 skin in Fortnite you don't need the Ariana Grande skin that bad to finance it
3721407	3747448	because the amount that you end up paying but this goes to things like and this is the reality of the world and there's there are a lot of people out there that are financing DoorDash meals because there's so much in advertising and things like that that encourage it and I am so worried that this shit is only going to get worse and these types of companies are only going to get more predatory because when somebody is fucking hungry and it's push at tap
3747428	3770888	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3771138	3781782	I'm really frightened to see what it does to people.
3782864	3786111	We're going to have a chat button that says click to taco a representative.
3788276	3788937	Goodbye.
3788998	3789539	Good night.
3789619	3790581	We're leaving.
3792299	3797908	Yeah, just don't participate with this at all, I would say.
3800893	3805641	In-game purchases shouldn't be that expensive in the first place, like any of this stuff.
3806082	3806763	I just don't know.
3808205	3808786	That's true.
3809808	3816940	Before you push the button to finance these skins, why don't you work on hacking the server to get them for free?
3818641	3822046	Yeah, and I should be noted that it's not necessarily in Fortnite.
3822066	3824390	It's just Xsolla has partnered with Epic Games.
3824871	3829158	So Xsolla, I think, is the payment processor, but they also offer these services separately.
3829178	3832743	Which means the Epic Games store will be part of this as well.
3833905	3835868	Yeah, it's not tied into that.
3835888	3838092	So, I mean, I don't know.
3838112	3840295	You shouldn't be financing...
3840494	3842578	Just wait.
3842698	3849911	If you're looking to finance a brand new game or something like that, just wait for it to go on sale.
3851213	3852315	You can wait to do it.
3852335	3856242	Also, with the DoorDash stuff, assuming that you're able to do it,
3856627	3874804	like and and you're you're you'll have the mobility to be able to leave your house and do all that stuff it's a lot cheaper just to go pick it up yourself like i get it it's the convenience but they're charging you a fee on top of a fee on charge on top of raising the prices on all the items like it's just just do it yourself
3875020	3880990	and then put the $10 that would have cost you a DoorDash in some type of account that has dividends.
3881010	3896337	I mean, I know I'm talking like a, you know, but like the reality is, people, you got to save whatever you can, especially in these times, you know, and I know it's hard, but it's just, it's crazy out there.
3896806	3899069	Rimari in chat says, I have a friend who's disabled.
3899089	3900891	He's dependent on delivery apps to get food.
3900931	3901552	That's different.
3901733	3902514	That's very different.
3902534	3906198	Yeah, that's completely different and completely understandable.
3906218	3912987	But I would also wonder what type of social and public services, well, used to be available a year ago, I guess.
3913268	3915491	Who fucking knows now in 2025?
3916652	3920277	Hopefully they may have some friends willing to help out once in a while or something.
3920558	3924483	Hopefully there are some other options to mix in with that, but that is a completely different scenario.
3924603	3924703	Yeah.
3924802	3931808	Yeah, and with that, I would say also, too, like sometimes it may not be like, say you want to get pizza delivered or something like that.
3932075	3934138	Don't go through DoorDash to get that pizza delivered.
3934218	3936821	Go through the actual pizza company's website.
3936861	3938583	Some of them you don't have a choice anymore.
3938643	3940285	Some of them you don't have a choice.
3940305	3942948	Some of them they just use that as their delivery option.
3943509	3946793	And then that's, I mean, obviously that's going to be your only option.
3946993	3949516	But a lot of them don't do that.
3949536	3951118	A lot of them have their own drivers.
3951399	3955063	And so if you pay that way, it's going to be significantly cheaper than it.
3955263	3957326	You just have to do your research, I guess.
3957346	3960850	You have to do your due diligence to make sure that you're not getting ripped off.
3961100	3965086	And just so chat understands, I'm not saying never use DoorDash.
3965247	3966028	It is a luxury.
3966128	3970114	Oh yeah, I DoorDash food today, so I'll be like... Treat it like a luxury.
3970134	3971577	That's what it is.
3971597	3973520	But recognize what you're really paying for that.
3973540	3978147	Recognize that, okay, I'm spending $20 to...
3978447	3994971	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3994951	3996073	But it's interesting.
3996093	3997294	This is a whole other conversation.
3997314	4001600	We were just talking about this the other day because we were – I went out for Indian food with some friends.
4002441	4004103	Ironically, some friends that play Ingress.
4004123	4005846	So it's all some video gaming stuff.
4006326	4012595	I went out and met some friends for Indian food and we were kind of mentioning like, oh, the Indian food place, we see so many DoorDash people.
4012615	4017742	Like we were the only people in the restaurant but we saw so many DoorDash and those people going in and out, right?
4017762	4019524	And it's that whole like –
4019504	4025730	But now you have restaurants like Red Lobster, TGI Fridays, they're all going under.
4026811	4029113	And, you know, it's like, why?
4029213	4033937	And, you know, people, I think people are failing to see the reason is people are door dashing better food now.
4034237	4049511	They're door dashing more local, smaller cuisines, like Chinese food, Mexican food, Indian food, you name it, your favorite, you know, more mom and pop smaller store cuisine that like, who sits there and goes, I'm going to door dash TGI Fridays.
4049491	4053855	If you want TGI Friday's mozzarella stick, they sell them in a bag in the freezer section at the store.
4053875	4057578	And that's why those types of places are going under because nobody really craves the food.
4057598	4059180	Hooters, that's another great example.
4061082	4062563	Who door dashed Hooters?
4062583	4065005	Did anybody ever door dash Hooters?
4065025	4065966	Unless it was a meme?
4065986	4066927	I've seen it on DoorDash.
4067047	4068448	Okay, then that's a meme.
4068468	4069469	That's a fucking meme.
4070891	4072672	I've seen it on DoorDash.
4073113	4077036	I would never eat their food because I've had their food many times and I don't like it.
4077056	4078958	But it's...
4079748	4080632	Yeah, I don't know.
4081716	4083765	Anyway, I don't know why I got on that tangent.
4083785	4088003	It was in Rancho, and now it's a better chicken place.
4089097	4092000	DJ Ranma says, Rob, I would if I had one nearby.
4092240	4093402	Well, they had a different place.
4093442	4104593	They had a place called Twin Peaks, which sadly has nothing to do with the David Lynchian masterpiece and everything to do with Twin Peaks on a lady's chest, right?
4104613	4106435	It's that sort of thing.
4106796	4108938	That restaurant is gone now, too.
4109599	4117467	I found out recently that we have a local bikini coffee shop
4118830	4121392	Over Here By, like in Carmichael.
4121673	4122073	Oh, really?
4123595	4131282	It's right next to a place, a Japanese sushi restaurant that my wife goes to all the time.
4131783	4142273	And I know we were leaving there one day, I'm like, wait, that looks like one of those bikini restaurant things, or like, because the name, it's like, you know, a double entendre name, you know, something like that.
4142293	4144935	Baristas in bikinis, that type of thing.
4144955	4146677	Yeah, yeah.
4146877	4151004	I mean, I guess we have the weather here to support something like that.
4151024	4152967	So work, I guess.
4153448	4153708	All right.
4153748	4155431	Anyway, let's move on.
4155491	4157114	We're way on a tangent.
4157134	4159618	But what else do you expect here at Orange Launch Radio?
4159698	4162582	Let's talk a little bit about Amazon and Nintendo.
4162603	4172158	You probably noticed you were not able to get a Switch 2 through Amazon, and it was a pretty glaring omission of the different retailers that you could pick up a Switch from.
4172138	4178267	Well, Bloomberg has run a report this week that has talked about the recent issues between the two companies.
4178908	4188522	Apparently, Nintendo of America was not happy that third-party sellers on Amazon were selling video games for lower prices than what Nintendo had advertised.
4188542	4198436	And what they would do, they would buy the games in bulk from Southeast Asia, export them to the United States, and then turn them around cheaper than the recommended retail price.
4198456	4198937	Honestly?
4198957	4199698	Yeah.
4199678	4201282	Smart Strategy, I guess, right?
4201824	4204671	But Amazon did not stop this from happening.
4204691	4207538	So Nintendo said, fuck you, Amazon.
4207558	4210566	I'm paraphrasing, but essentially that's what happened.
4211693	4216520	Both companies are denying what Bloomberg has said, by the way, which I think is interesting as well.
4217181	4227015	In a quote here, Amazon tried to assuage Nintendo by offering to attach labels to products that guarantee they're authentic.
4227035	4233043	Amazon uses the technique to assure shoppers products aren't counterfeits and to help track merchandise.
4233023	4240059	But the offer wasn't sufficient, the person said, and Nintendo ultimately opted to pull its products from Amazon in the U.S.
4240440	4241823	My how times have changed.
4241843	4244569	We're talking about an Amazon seal of quality.
4245612	4247075	on a Nintendo product.
4247355	4248637	How times have changed.
4248738	4252504	Let's just pause for a second and understand the irony of that.
4252524	4256271	The Amazon seal of quality on a Nintendo product.
4256351	4260478	With all the Chinese knockoff fake stuff that's in their marketplace.
4261540	4262462	Yeah, okay.
4263023	4268633	Or Amazon Basic where they rip off other people by stealing their designs and stuff.
4268673	4269014	Yeah.
4269174	4269274	Yeah.
4270823	4290064	XBOX Game Pass
4290044	4309183	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4309163	4333163	Game Pass Game Pass Game Pass
4333143	4334626	Apparently.
4334646	4335849	So, yeah.
4336129	4341881	So, well, then they added five games that did nothing to advertise or bring eyesight to that.
4342242	4344166	I posted on Blue Sky about that.
4344426	4345889	The AntStream account, nothing.
4346150	4348254	Xbox account, nothing.
4348274	4352984	Like, hello, do you want these products to succeed or no?
4353505	4353565	No.
4353697	4355219	No.
4355239	4355499	Anyway.
4357522	4366674	So, yeah, it could be interesting to see what the effect is that this has on Game Pass because now there's not going to be an Everwild, there's not going to be a Perfect Dark, there's not going to be an MMO from Zenimax.
4367855	4371079	It'll be interesting to see what happens with that.
4371099	4372040	All right.
4372561	4375705	Speaking of things that layoffs have unfortunately impacted, Loki.
4376360	4380366	Yes, let's talk about another game that's getting cancelled as well.
4380526	4383010	Outriders 2.
4383171	4387257	Apparently it was cancelled over issues with Square Enix.
4391363	4397693	People Can Fly was working on a game called Codename Gemini, which has of course now been suspended.
4397713	4402080	And they reported that the sequel was nearly finished.
4402128	4408281	Before Square Enix decided to... I don't know what they're disputing over.
4408902	4412549	But basically, yeah, it's not coming out.
4412569	4414072	So sorry, no Outriders 2.
4416758	4417459	That's unfortunate.
4418461	4420305	Yeah, um...
4420437	4422900	I know maybe because the first game didn't do as well.
4423021	4426005	It says it didn't turn a profit within its first year.
4426565	4428969	I thought there were quite a few people playing that game at first.
4428989	4431732	I guess it didn't sustain itself or something.
4431752	4433795	Yeah, DJ Ranma S says Outriders was a fun game.
4433815	4435097	It was like a third person Borderlands.
4435277	4436939	I even played Outriders in the beginning.
4436959	4439823	It was on Game Pass, so it was easy to, you know, kind of get into.
4440524	4441386	So it's kind of a bummer.
4442928	4443188	Oh, well.
4444169	4444690	Sucks.
4444805	4465125	Anthem will officially shut down January 12, 2026
4465105	4470933	EA has made it very clear, once the servers go offline, the game will no longer be playable.
4470953	4475139	Anthem is being delisted from EA Play as of August 15th, 2025.
4475239	4484192	I believe none of the money in-game can be spent, like you can't buy stuff for money in-game and all that stuff anymore.
4484312	4488297	Yeah, it's on its way out, which probably isn't surprising.
4488858	4490320	But you know, there are...
4490300	4494565	Still a handful of people that are playing that, I'm sure, that are devastated by this news.
4494625	4506037	And so I don't mean to like shit on the fans of this game, but this is exactly to bring it full circle why people want to be able to run their own Anthem servers then, or, you know, pay to have, you know, something going on in the cloud or something like that.
4506718	4508620	Jvmon in chat says, Anthem was still around?
4508640	4510282	I thought it closed down like two years ago.
4510342	4511723	Yeah, I did too.
4512164	4516488	But just because it's, you know, somebody out there still playing it, obviously.
4516508	4518130	So it is, it is...
4518110	4536614	I'm sad in that regard to see it go, but to me, Anthem is a symbol of every bad decision that Bioware has made under EA's control in the last few years, so I'm not exactly sorry to see it go, but that doesn't mean that people shouldn't still be able to play it if they don't want to.
4538056	4540278	Yeah.
4540298	4547728	Questbuster says that content support ended, but they still kept the game alive, and says it was fun being a magic-wielding Iron Man.
4548063	4549906	All right.
4550307	4558841	Since we already did our classic game of the week, we're going to skip on ahead to rapid fire news and talk about some other headlines going on a little quickly here.
4558881	4559602	Loki, we'll go to you.
4560724	4561165	All right.
4561265	4569799	So Hades 2, they've got... Basically, it's last patch before launch.
4571021	4572383	And...
4572717	4578644	Yeah, so I guess they're talking about coming out early access because I was like reading that.
4578744	4580507	It's been in early access for a while now.
4580827	4582449	Yeah, it's been in early access for a while.
4582489	4584812	So I was like before how patch before launch.
4586074	4595265	But yeah, so basically it's getting its last major update before I guess going to be version 1.0 at some point.
4595245	4596808	Um, so that's cool.
4597349	4600635	I can't wait to see how it turns out, I guess.
4600755	4601036	I don't know.
4601056	4602579	I haven't played Hades or Hades 2.
4602719	4603801	Oh, you're missing out.
4603821	4604562	There's some good games.
4604582	4606025	Hades is good.
4606466	4610193	I played a little bit of Hades 2, but I'm kind of waiting for the library.
4610774	4613459	I'm kind of waiting for Hades 2 to be done before I jump back in.
4613479	4615262	But it was I really enjoyed what I played.
4616137	4617338	Yeah.
4617418	4622944	Also, SNK has delisted a bunch of games from its Google Play Store.
4623685	4645468	I forget that they have games on the Google Play Store because I don't really think about playing Metal Slug on my phone, but apparently they've delisted their ports of Blazing Star, Metal Slug, Metal Slug 2, Metal Slug X, Fail Fury Special, Garou Mark of the Wolves, King of Fighters 97, King of Fighters 98, and Samurai Shodown 2.
4645448	4653417	um yeah so that sucks but I mean I'm guessing they've been on there for a long time
4654578	4656380	Yes.
4656400	4663109	Well, let's move on to talking about what's coming out for Arcade Archives Series 2.
4664051	4669278	We have a game, I must admit, I'm not super familiar with this game, but some of you out there probably know it.
4669658	4672001	Super Dimension Fortress Macross 2.
4672702	4678851	I certainly know Macross, but I don't remember this particular arcade game, but this is probably something that Jamie played.
4678871	4679472	And it's a schmucks.
4679492	4680533	Super Dimension Fortress.
4680633	4681755	It's just, it's Macross.
4681835	4682796	It's, it's,
4682776	4684079	I just never played this game.
4684119	4685903	Macross is the full name.
4686144	4687106	Okay, interesting.
4687487	4690735	Well, I guess probably some of you in chat play this.
4690815	4697751	It definitely looks a lot like kind of Gradius with the power-ups and stuff, but it looks pretty cool.
4697811	4700177	Okay, I'd check this out.
4700157	4703843	Have you seen... We're going to go on the tangent train now.
4703903	4710454	Have you seen that... It's not new, but it's an emulator that's for the NES.
4710674	4715322	It's like the old 3DS NES games.
4715342	4717485	Remember how they had the 3D 3DS games?
4717545	4718006	Yes.
4718207	4719128	Can we come back to that?
4719108	4745335	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4745315	4752390	Um, which allows the emulation of, I guess, some stronger systems because it's only available on certain platforms.
4752610	4753312	So there is that.
4754233	4761248	And, of course, one other headline, and we already kind of referenced this earlier in the show, and that is the fact that, um...
4761228	4763853	Summer Games Done Quick is underway.
4763953	4775794	Summer Games Done Quick 2025 Raising Money for Doctors Without Borders running starting today on July 6th and running through the rest of the week through the 13th.
4776280	4791572	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4791552	4792914	If nothing else, check it out.
4793014	4794797	They're raising money for charity.
4794897	4802087	VOG Network's own Bobby Blackwolf will be there on Thursday and Saturday, helping out with reading some donations and all that stuff.
4802167	4806474	But just remember, you can't do any type of shout-out for VOG, Bobby, OLR.
4806494	4807535	They will not get read.
4807595	4810379	It is not about people's egos.
4810399	4811882	It is about the speedrunners.
4811902	4813143	It is about the charity.
4813564	4814686	It's about the event.
4814706	4819112	So keep your comments on your donations about those sorts of things would be my advice because...
4819092	4826879	Even I tried to send in a donation once that was from Mr. Smush and they didn't read it because they thought it was some type of R-rated joke.
4826899	4828981	It didn't even make its way to Bobby's desk.
4829242	4831164	The screeners cut it out beforehand.
4831444	4833546	Which makes, I mean, in retrospect, makes sense.
4833626	4840893	Like, if you don't know that Mr. Smush is my cat, you're not going to know what the hell that is and so you're going to throw it out because you don't want something coded to make it out on stream.
4840913	4842675	So be very careful what you write with those donations.
4842975	4843455	But you know what?
4843595	4844937	Or just donate.
4845657	4846178	Just donate.
4847399	4848340	In chat...
4848961	4853129	DarkTetsuya says it's actually Arcade Archives 1 is Macross.
4853189	4857938	Arcade Archives 2 got Air Combat 22 this week, if I recall correctly.
4858439	4864450	Okay, let's go back to what you were talking about, Loki, when we were doing Rapid Fire News, because we have some time anyway here.
4864711	4866514	We have a little extra time with Jamie cutting out early.
4867376	4867476	Sure.
4868452	4870014	One other thing I played this week.
4870034	4877766	So there's this big trend online lately of Nintendo games getting ported to Super Nintendo.
4877786	4881031	We had a story on this last week, the week before.
4881412	4887000	Life Force, or Salamander, but Life Force here in the US was one of these games that was recently ported.
4887361	4891146	And you might go, well, why do they put the NES game on the Super Nintendo?
4891166	4892589	Because they don't change the graphics.
4893169	4894652	It's not like it's completely different.
4894672	4895573	They don't do that.
4895553	4907146	They do that so that it helps to reduce flicker, slow down, and sometimes they can add different types of music types of stuff to it.
4907446	4916135	One game that I actually played this week is I actually played a Kid Icarus port of Kid Icarus ported to the Super Nintendo.
4917237	4924024	Part of what the Super Nintendo port does is it brings in the backgrounds from the 3DS version.
4924004	4950096	which is very interesting although I gotta be honest I didn't find that it really like ran any better to me but look I found this random YouTube video and I'm going to bring this up for folks that are watching live but you can see what this looks like it kind of adds a lot to it it really is just the NES version of Kid Icarus but it's using the backgrounds from the 3DS version of the game and you'll notice they they scroll at kind of a different rate you know um
4950076	4979188	I was talking about...
4979168	4982375	Remember how they had the 3D Excite bike and stuff like that?
4982395	4988307	How it was actually three-dimensional with the particular display?
4988687	4994279	So they have an actual emulator that is on Steam.
4994339	4995000	I know that.
4996944	4998568	I'm trying to remember what it's called.
4999469	4999810	Um...
5001275	5006380	It's basically a 3D emulator that 3D-ifies games.
5006500	5012887	I don't know if people have to add a configuration, but it supports a lot of games already.
5012907	5016350	But it makes everything look voxel-y, I guess.
5016370	5020975	Is it... Okay, I'm looking at a YouTube, but this is dated three years ago, so maybe it's not this.
5020995	5021856	Is it this?
5022396	5023277	Is it this, Loki?
5024899	5025519	Let's see here.
5025719	5028362	It is... That's...
5028882	5030104	I don't know if I like this.
5030124	5030585	It could be.
5030945	5032107	This looks kind of funky to me.
5032227	5033008	Yeah, it could be.
5033028	5036894	Well, you can adjust the camera and everything on it because it's fully 3D.
5036914	5037936	I don't know if I like that, though.
5037956	5039839	That just seems... But, okay.
5040620	5043545	Yeah, it's called 3D Sen, is what it's called.
5044246	5047451	And it's a paid emulator on PC.
5047551	5048553	Oh, yeah, 3D Sen.
5049494	5051377	Also supports VR and stuff.
5051397	5052679	But, yeah, it looked pretty cool.
5052659	5053940	Hmm, interesting.
5053960	5057204	I was curious to see what Pixel Poop's number two would look like in that.
5057905	5058866	Okay, okay.
5058926	5061930	Probably pretty terrible because I don't think it's set up.
5061950	5063231	You mean pretty poopy?
5063251	5065113	It would look pretty poopy, yeah.
5065934	5067897	But I don't even know if it would run in that.
5067917	5069919	I'd have to check and see.
5070279	5073363	But some of the demos that they were showing look pretty cool.
5073803	5081572	Well, you know I have this fancy new video card, and if nothing else, I can run 3D emulators on it, so let's go, right?
5081592	5082193	All right.
5083220	5085563	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.
5085583	5090629	Let's check out some games that are coming out, you know, 3D emulated or not.
5090649	5092932	Obviously not, because these are all new games.
5093312	5099960	And you should support games when they come out and not pirate them, because that's why we have layoffs.
5100061	5103164	Loki, starting in the US, what do you have coming out?
5103184	5107890	Yeah, I had to check to make sure this wasn't a typo, but Backyard Baseball 01.
5107910	5109993	That's right, from 2001.
5110013	5111134	Ha!
5111587	5116783	PC, iOS, and Android I don't know why that's being ported.
5117264	5118066	It is so old.
5119090	5126271	Missile Command Delta on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series
5126487	5149407	We have Bad End Theater on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series EA Sports College Football 26 on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series Everdeep Aurora on PC and Nintendo Switch Islanders New Shores on PC, Mac, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series
5150281	5165303	System Shock 2 25th Anniversary Remaster on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series Bendy and the Dark Revival on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series
5165283	5183730	Patsapon 1 and 2 replay on PC, Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation 5 And last but not least, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 and 4 on PC, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series
5185415	5187298	All right.
5187919	5188681	Going to Japan.
5189302	5193329	On the Switch 2 this week in Japan, Split Fiction gets its Japanese release.
5193870	5196034	Please recognize that it's just a code in a box.
5196635	5198057	I know that's those types of releases.
5198077	5198879	Code in a box.
5198899	5199700	That's right.
5199720	5204048	Those releases have been somewhat controversial, but that is what they're putting on the shelves this week.
5204028	5208835	On the original Switch, though, there's a lot more going on, which, of course, Switch 2 plays a lot of these.
5208855	5218751	Legacy of Kain, Soul Reaver 1 and 2 Remastered is out this week, as well as the game Uta Tomori no Yokai Yashiki is also out this week on the original Switch.
5219372	5223799	We also have a game called the Irem Collection Volume 3, the Irem Collections.
5223819	5225101	We've had a few of these recently.
5225421	5229748	This one has Mystic Riders, Dragon Breed, and Mr. Heli Battle Chopper.
5229828	5229968	I think
5229948	5259111	Patapon 1 and 2 Natsuman 20th Century Summer Vacation Plus Broadcast Over Sunset
5259091	5261096	Yep, that's the name of the game.
5261156	5268656	It's childhood adventures in 3D recreations of quaint shopping districts and single car trains.
5268676	5273910	By the way, our pal Shane is over in Japan right now.
5273975	5276658	and rode the Oshawott train today for the first time.
5276678	5279581	Did you know there's a whole fucking train that's themed Oshawott?
5279601	5280702	I was looking at that on this blue sky.
5280722	5282404	No, but I'm not surprised that you wrote it.
5282544	5287089	And I was just like, oh my god, it literally looks like Shane designed the train.
5287749	5295558	It's Oshawott seats, little plush Oshawotts they leave on the seats, little Oshawott designs on the carpet, on the side of the train.
5295698	5299361	I was just like, Oshawott threw up all over the inside of this thing.
5299522	5300843	But look, hey, look.
5301464	5305409	If it was Bad Bats Maru, I'd want to go on the train as well.
5305429	5307211	So I get it.
5307231	5313719	I'm not going to yuck somebody's yum, but it was just a lot.
5313739	5317844	On the PlayStation 5, that same Iram Collection Volume 3 is coming out.
5317884	5321149	Legacy of Kain, Soul Reaver 1 and 2 Remastered, also out on PlayStation 5.
5321589	5327496	Police Simulator Patrol Officers at Cab includes Police Simulator players.
5327516	5331201	And I think that's it for Japan this week.
5331772	5333536	So, how about the UK?
5335359	5348286	We've got College Football 26 on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 and 4 on PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch, and Patapon 1 and 2 replay on Switch.
5350530	5350911	That's it.
5367361	5369506	Sorry, I just realized this whole time my mic was off.
5369646	5373494	So I was I was wondering why you weren't responding.
5373514	5373815	That's OK.
5374336	5374997	Let's try again.
5375619	5377403	So I think we've got one more story for you.
5377463	5383195	And it has to do with this something we were talking about last week with Mind's Eyes release.
5383696	5386382	And yeah, interesting follow up, huh?
5386362	5391250	I don't like when... It's not even just necessarily this company.
5391311	5394176	But I don't like when, for example, what was it?
5394757	5396359	Ghostbusters 2016.
5398323	5401348	Some of these other Marvel series and stuff like that.
5401408	5405175	Where if you don't like it, it's because of this reason.
5405195	5407118	It's not because it's bad.
5407178	5409061	It's because, oh, well, you're racist.
5409182	5410564	Or, oh, you just...
5410544	5419115	You know, you are... Clearly, the bad reviews for this game that, with my own eyes, can see is bad.
5419595	5425443	Like, I don't need someone to tell me it's bad, they just show me, here's some gameplay from the game, and I'm like, yeah, that looks bad.
5426344	5429328	Clearly, this is sabotage.
5430149	5433733	At least, that's what Leslie Benzies is trying to...
5434844	5444230	Convince everybody that rough launch on Saboteurs and that they are promising the relaunch of Mind's Eye in the future.
5446117	5452248	The saboteurs, or people that were talking bad about the game, didn't make the game bad to begin with.
5452709	5454833	You made the game bad to begin with.
5455013	5458319	So, I have a hard time believing that.
5458379	5464831	But they said that there is a concerted effort by someone to ruin the game's reputation before release.
5465913	5467335	Is this someone in the room?
5468217	5468918	It's like...
5469185	5470607	What are you talking about?
5471668	5481181	We didn't know what the game was because you were showing us weird cinematic trailers all the time and then you release the game and it's absolute garbage.
5482142	5486448	Do you remember when the people in charge used to take accountability?
5486928	5487769	Do you remember that?
5487789	5488691	Do you remember Iwata?
5488871	5490633	Do you remember people that take accountability?
5492396	5494298	No, I mean, it's been a while.
5495122	5496443	All right.
5496463	5504391	Well, yeah, I think suffice to say it's yeah, you could you could throw whatever reasons you want out there, buddy.
5504431	5505852	But the call is coming from inside the house.
5506713	5507313	Exactly.
5507333	5510516	It's like it's just it's bad looking like it looks bad.
5510536	5517523	The reviews like when people show reviews for a game, like especially a video review, like you're seeing the gameplay.
5517703	5518984	I can see it with my own eyes.
5519024	5521787	It's not that someone's telling me, oh, this is bad.
5521767	5542763	and I look at that gameplay I'm like well it looks fine to me but if they're saying it's bad it must be bad no it looks like trash it looks like a game that is not cooked enough that you need to spend a lot more time on that somebody who used to be in charge of like the Grand Theft Auto franchise should do better it's dated it has dated gameplay mechanics it's
5544194	5545015	I don't know.
5545035	5555708	It's one of these games where you have, you know, somebody that is the top of their game for this one series and then they strike out on their own and you're like, well, I mean, they did a great job with Mega Man, so Mighty No.
5555728	5557109	9 should be great, right?
5557710	5558010	Right?
5562195	5568042	No.
5568022	5572069	Yeah, because some people on the internet are ridiculous all the time.
5572811	5581226	And yeah, Ironheart, you know, some people have a problem with diversity.
5581246	5584692	Some people have a problem with it and will go out of their way to say so.
5584892	5585574	And I get it.
5585694	5590182	And there's a lot of people that will discount something strictly because of diversity or whatever.
5590162	5597914	That said though, there's also people that will use that claim to mask actual hate for the stuff.
5597934	5599556	For example, She-Hulk.
5599696	5600818	I hated that series.
5601198	5601519	Why?
5601819	5602921	Because it was stupid.
5603422	5605244	It was just poorly written.
5605945	5612355	The concept sounded like it would be really cool, and then they just went and twisted it around and like...
5612335	5618252	Just made it some cringe fest thing and they're like, well, you just hate it because you're a chauvinistic pig or something like that.
5618473	5620017	It's like, no, it's poorly written.
5622224	5622685	I get that.
5622705	5623307	I get that.
5624350	5628054	Alright, now we're going to get to the listener roundtable.
5628154	5635443	So we're going to take your questions in chat and then your emails and maybe some calls in our Discord server over in the green room.
5636484	5641750	I forgot I need to pull up the mailbag because DarkSakura isn't here and I know there was at least one email tonight.
5642431	5645114	So I need just a minute here.
5645174	5650480	Do you have any last minute stories, Loki, while I try to pull up the email?
5650500	5650560	No.
5650912	5656702	Um, I, I, I forgot to mention when I said that Romero, the Romero game, uh, game was canceled.
5656742	5658064	Actually, the studio has been closed down.
5658725	5661370	So that's a little bit worse that their whole studio went down.
5662251	5667560	Um, you know, speaking of that Marvel series, like what I was going to say, there's a lot of their TV series have not been good.
5667900	5671406	And it's, it's surprising because a lot of that stuff, like I love She-Hulk as a character.
5671667	5672468	This isn't like the show.
5672488	5674371	I thought the show was awful.
5674391	5675974	Um, Echo, God damn.
5676578	5699105	We hope this email finds you well.
5699206	5705353	Happy belated pride from a listener and friend who's plural, one side demi-masculine, one side trans-feminine.
5705333	5734024	Bisexual, polyamorous, demiromantic, and autistic And also, since it's July 4th as we write this And there's a quote here, a screenshot saying This whole thing smacks of gender, I holler As I overturn my uncle's barbecue grill And turn the 4th of July into the 4th of shit I think most people that are not interested in celebrating the 4th of July figured this out But July the 4th happens to be the birthday of the Caesar salad
5734004	5745839	So when I was at a local bar which has an outdoor section and they were lighting off fireworks, I made sure to proclaim happy birthday to the Caesar salad because that is the only thing we are celebrating today.
5747281	5749584	So, yes.
5749604	5751006	So happy birthday, Caesar salad.
5751026	5761460	I hope you all had a great celebration celebrating the anniversary of such a yummy dish, which, by the way, I think you all know by now, but it was not invented in Italy.
5761480	5763943	It was a casino in Tijuana.
5764193	5767364	that I think was named Caesar's or the guy that ran it was named Caesar.
5767425	5768910	That's why it's called that.
5768950	5772583	But it was the Caesar salad was invented in Tijuana.
5772648	5778815	Anyway, first of all, an analogy to express my thoughts on a certain console maker's nonsense.
5779616	5789647	Spillfencer demolishes half of his house, leaving only the kitchen and living room, then tells his family that he had to make difficult decisions, but that their house is looking better than ever.
5790528	5792030	Look at all that place.
5792350	5793812	We can extend the garden.
5794873	5797356	Think of all that garden we can have now.
5799783	5800584	Let's see.
5800644	5810296	Second, with the Stop Killing Games initiative back in full force after a harassment counter campaign, I often think about this as of late because I play a lot of modern rhythm games, i.e.
5810376	5815802	those made within the last 10 years, like Chunathim, Mai Mai, Archaea, and Easy 2 On.
5815842	5826195	And a lot of modern rhythm games have some form of DRM or another to prevent playing if you're offline, or at least debuffing a lot of the functionality in the case of Archaea.
5826175	5828079	or Dance Dance Revolution nowadays.
5828439	5829902	That is an interesting one.
5830163	5833750	And I think that's because of the music rights.
5833770	5842547	So that puts a whole other twist on things where when you have the music rights that come into play, now you sort of have to protect that
5842527	5859613	Game, or else they're not going to license those songs to you from being able to do a lot with that offline or strip the music out, especially if we're talking about like in some of the old, you know, 2DX actually had like the master cuts to an extent because, you know, the instrumentation was actually tied to the buttons.
5859913	5865121	So they actually had to have like the master recordings to strip out certain sound effects of the vocals and isolate those.
5865141	5866543	And if that can get dumped on
5866523	5879157	or Get Out There Somehow, it can cause people to do whatever they want with those songs, which, you know, the record labels don't really like, even though, you know, all this time later, that's all out there for all those old 2DX games.
5879177	5879838	But I digress.
5879978	5888648	I think with the music games in particular, they have to put the walls up a little bit higher because that's the only way they're going to convince the record labels to give them the licenses.
5888668	5890270	But even with those games...
5891060	5898330	I think once they pull them offline, anything that you bought, you should still be able to play, licensed or not.
5898350	5910467	Anyway, only a scant few rhythm games, at least on PC and mobile, made in the last 10 or so years don't have online DRM, most notably Fygros and Orzmic, both of which are non-profit games.
5911289	5913051	There's the huge twist.
5913031	5921366	Arcade rhythm games, at least many of them going out of service, get offline patches so they can be played even after cessation of service, albeit in reduced forms.
5921466	5925012	Can't save scores, can't save options, some songs are missing.
5925032	5928498	But what happens to mobile-based rhythm games when they reach end of service?
5929259	5934128	One notorious example is Love Live Live.
5934108	5946103	Love Live School Idol Festival, a somewhat infamous hybrid of gacha game and rhythm game, with all the your scores depend on how powerful and rare your cards are that entails.
5946123	5950950	The original game shut down after a little over 10 years and can no longer be played.
5950970	5959761	Then came Love Live School Idol Festival 2, which was shut down after only one year in Japan, and perhaps even more notoriously had its global version release date 8th.
5959741	5962023	and Shutdown announced at the same time.
5962384	5964606	The poor thing lived only three months.
5965227	5969912	And in this screenshot of an announcement that says, this is wild.
5970753	5973776	How do I show this without showing the whole damn mailbox?
5973796	5974156	Here we go.
5974176	5974817	I can show it this way.
5976979	5980863	Let me show this on the other screen without the token visible.
5981364	5983386	Okay, so...
5983366	5985149	Global launch notice.
5985509	5989074	We are excited to break the news to you that the global version of Love Live!
5989134	5992759	School Idol Festival 2 Miracle Live is launching soon in February 2024.
5993120	6000250	However, we also want to inform you that the global version will close its doors on May 31st and cease in-app purchases accordingly.
6001452	6003034	I remember that.
6003054	6005337	I remember when that came out.
6005357	6007480	I remember something about that.
6007600	6008682	Anyway.
6009522	6031058	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6031038	6055071	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6055051	6055351	.
6055371	6055412	.
6055432	6076063	.
6076043	6083431	very infamously had that partnership with a different drum, that synth pop label out of Salt Lake City that gave us some bangers, right?
6083451	6085013	That's how we got Echo Image.
6085053	6090359	That's how we got, you know, we got a lot of great artists from that in those games.
6090379	6102372	And they, my, I don't know if this is true, so do not quote me in an article somewhere, but I thought I remember hearing those songs were licensed for 50 bucks a pop.
6103128	6132274	I thought I remember hearing that somewhere along the way that it was like 50 bucks but think about but also but like on the flip side think about like they're kind of getting paid in exposure right like Echo Image made you know they sold albums based off that and and probably we were to help a little bit because we hyped the shit out of them but deserved I love Echo Image that's still Compufonics one of my favorite albums to this day quite honestly so um you know I I think you
6132254	6140256	Yes, they are probably able to license some songs very cheap because, yeah, it's...
6141755	6144157	They're getting paid in exposure, I guess.
6144898	6151565	Anyway, all of this has me concerned for the sustainability of rhythm games, along with the constant demand for new content.
6151585	6160814	They're always having to add new songs every month or two, or else the spoiled players will slam their fists at the metaphorical dinner table demanding, where's content?
6160874	6162636	Where's content, dead game?
6162656	6165478	Move on, and then the game loses revenue and dies.
6165498	6169062	In 10 years, let alone 20, will I still be able to play games like...
6169042	6172448	Roteno, The Funny Gyroscope Rhythm Game, and D4DJ.
6173169	6182765	I also hope gacha game players will think about the Stop Killing Games initiative because gacha games by their nature require online DRM so that people can't save scum their roles.
6182785	6195066	I understand that a lot of gacha game players enjoy these games because they are often free to start and can be played on a device they probably already have as opposed to having a good enough PC or console for it, especially in Southeast Asia where people like anime stuff or
6195046	6200274	Thank you for the email.
6201055	6223669	I appreciate it.
6224628	6251327	I get that there's more to consider but even in the gacha space if you paid money to get that song then you should have that song and you should be able to play it in that game in perpetuity I do believe that but it's going to be one of those things it's a hard nut to crack and I think at the end of the day it's probably just going to have to do with a lot of those agreements that you sign off on
6252050	6254454	The companies have been writing them for forever.
6254494	6256758	It's time for us to write ours.
6256778	6264612	So on that note, if you want to send us an email for a future week, participate at orangelaunchradio.com is the place to do it.
6264753	6266616	Any other last minute stories for us tonight, Loki?
6267322	6269245	No.
6269265	6269546	All right.
6270027	6272311	Well, then with that, we're going to wrap up the show.
6272852	6274835	Thanks as always for listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
6274915	6275757	Appreciate you all.
6276077	6279623	We are the place where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.
6280224	6281046	Help spread the word.
6281406	6284692	A nice comment on social media.
6284712	6288739	A nice five-star review on a site like Apple Podcasts, Spotify.
6288719	6291884	YouTube, wherever you found this going off a long way.
6291924	6297073	So thank you to everybody that sends and goes the extra mile and participates with the show.
6297093	6299898	Thank you to those of you that turned out here live on Twitch this evening.
6300199	6302242	Thank you to those that listen to us on the podcast feed.
6302563	6308112	I hope you all have a wonderful week gaming and we'll be back in seven days to wrap up the news once again.
6308092	6315381	Until then, DarkSakura's not here, so she won't be streaming after the show tonight, but I'm sure she would have something to say here at the end.
6315742	6318986	Oh, I think she already said FAC earlier on in the show.
6319066	6321229	She'll be streaming throughout the week on her channel.
6321269	6324313	You can check her out on Twitch at DarkSakuraTTV.
6324333	6327036	I'll give her a nice plug there in absence of a final thought.
6327156	6329780	So, Loki, your final thought tonight?
6329840	6334726	My final thought is that I'd like to get working on my modded series already.
6335888	6337069	It looks like a lot of fun.
6337876	6342403	And my final thought is I need to beat the main story in Fantasy Life already.
6342423	6349614	I keep getting distracted by crafting and leveling up jobs, but literally everybody who's in Endgame in that game says stop getting distracted by that.
6349634	6352418	You can catch up and do that stuff later after the story.
6352438	6353780	But it's hard.
6354401	6356424	I have to level everything up equally.
6356985	6358848	Everything leveling equally.
6358868	6363194	And why won't the game drop a goddamn woodcutter strangling?
6363435	6365638	I need a woodcutter in my party.
6366108	6368131	It's the one thing I'm missing.
6368151	6369513	Give me a woodcutter, Fantasy Life.
6369634	6371216	Damn you.
6371236	6373119	On that note, have a wonderful night, everybody.
6373139	6393651	Goodbye.
6394778	6404468	But you know they were all still true.
6407237	6408501	See you next week.
